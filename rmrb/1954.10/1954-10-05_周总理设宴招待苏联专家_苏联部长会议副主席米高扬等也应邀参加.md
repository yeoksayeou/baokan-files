    Present as hosts were Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Li Fuchun, and Li Xiannian, Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun, ministers of various ministries, directors of various commissions, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Xiuquan.

    Also present as hosts were Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Zhen, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Wu Yuzhang, Secretary-General Qian Junrui, Vice Mayor of Beijing Zhang Youyu, and heads of various universities and colleges in the capital.

    Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the banquet. He said:

    Dear comrades: As the Chinese people warmly celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend, on behalf of the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and Chairman Mao Zedong, cordial greetings and heartfelt thanks to all Soviet experts who are helping our country in various construction endeavors.

    In the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved many accomplishments in various construction endeavors. These achievements are inseparable from the sincere concern and great assistance of the great Soviet people and the high degree of internationalist spirit and selfless labor of all Soviet experts. In order to assist the Chinese people in their construction endeavors, you have contributed your rich knowledge and experience, trained Chinese cadres, and created favorable conditions for our country's successful construction of a socialist society. The Chinese people will never forget this profound friendship and sincere assistance. We have already written the unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union into the preamble of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is sufficient to fully illustrate this point.

    It should be particularly pointed out that, just as our people are beginning socialist construction and socialist transformation, the Soviet government opportunely held the Soviet Exhibition of Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction in Beijing. The content of this exhibition prominently demonstrates the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people in building communism, allowing the Chinese people to see the prospects of the socialist society they are striving to build, and providing the most specific and vivid learning models for China's construction endeavors. I would like to express, on behalf of the Chinese government, my gratitude and greetings to all Soviet comrades who participated in the work of the Soviet Exhibition for their hard work. The Soviet government delegation recently informed us that the Soviet Council of Ministers has decided to donate all the items displayed at the Soviet Exhibition to China after the exhibition is over. This noble friendship greatly encourages the Chinese people who are building socialism. To this end, I would like to express, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, my deep gratitude to the Soviet government and its delegation.

    Our country is at a new stage of historical development, and we are advancing towards a prosperous and happy socialist society along the path that the Soviet Union has already taken. Our people are confidently following the instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong, preparing to build our country, which is economically and culturally backward, into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture within a few five-year plans. In order to realize this great task, we must overcome many difficulties in our path forward, and therefore we must guard against boasting and pride, work diligently and honestly, learn more diligently from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and further consolidate the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. This is an important guarantee for completing our great socialist construction endeavor.

    Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by proposing a toast: To the ever-strengthening and developing great and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union! To the health of the Soviet experts who have given great assistance to the Chinese people in our country's construction endeavors! To the health of the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government!

    Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan then delivered a speech. He said to the Soviet experts: Premier Zhou Enlai's hosting of a banquet for you at a time when the great Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong are celebrating National Day demonstrates the high esteem that the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people have for your work. We are closely united with the Chinese people because we have a common goal, which is socialism. We have helped the Chinese people, and the Chinese people have also helped us. This mutual assistance between us is not only selfless but also brotherly. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people are proud to have such excellent comrades working in China. Mikoyan concluded by proposing a toast to the Chinese people, to the Communist Party of China, to Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and the other leading comrades of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Government.

    Ambassador Yudin said in his speech: We feel very happy to live and work in China, because we can see that the economic, political, and cultural construction of the Chinese people is developing day by day, and we see that China has become a unified and powerful country. We see new buildings and factories constantly appearing in China every month and every year, China's agriculture is also being continuously transformed, and China's intellectuals are mastering new technologies. All of this is the result of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the united will of the entire people. The Soviet people, who have embarked on the path of socialism and have already built a socialist society, cannot but feel happy about this and are heartily encouraged by it. Yudin concluded by proposing a toast to the new achievements of China in all aspects of its economy, politics, and culture.

    Soviet Chief Advisor Arkhipov delivered a speech. He said: On the occasion of the great festival of the Chinese people—the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China—please allow me to extend warm and heartfelt congratulations to our Chinese friends on behalf of all Soviet experts. The Soviet experts working in China are very grateful for the care and concern of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government. We assure you that Soviet experts will fulfill the tasks entrusted to us by the Soviet government and the Soviet people. We will do everything we can and use all our experience and knowledge to help Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals in their great construction and labor. Please allow me to propose a toast to our Chinese friends, to the leading cadres in industry, agriculture, and culture, to the Chinese experts who are building a socialist society together with their people! To the Chinese government headed by Premier Zhou Enlai! To the Communist Party of China and its leader Chairman Mao Zedong! May the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China be further consolidated!

    The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end.

    亲爱的同志们：当中国人民热烈祝贺中华人民共和国建国第五周年的时候，我谨代表中国政府、中国人民和毛泽东主席向帮助我国进行各项建设事业的全体苏联专家致以亲切的慰问和衷心的感谢。
    五年来，中国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导下，在各项建设事业中已取得了许多成就。这些成就的取得是同伟大的苏联人民的真诚关怀和巨大援助分不开的，是同全体苏联专家的高度国际主义精神和忘我劳动分不开的。你们为了帮助中国人民的建设事业，贡献了自己的丰富知识和经验，培养了中国干部，为我国胜利建设社会主义社会造成了良好的条件。中国人民对于这种深厚的友谊和真诚的援助，将永志不忘。我们已经把中苏两国牢不可破的伟大友谊写在中华人民共和国宪法的序言中，正足以充分说明这一点。
    特别应当指出，正当我国人民开始社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时候，苏联政府适时地在北京举行了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会。这个展览会的内容突出地表现了苏联人民在建设共产主义事业中所获得的光辉成果，使中国人民看见了自己正在努力建设的社会主义社会的远景，并对中国的建设事业提供了最具体、最生动的学习榜样。我谨代表中国政府对于参加苏联展览会工作的全体苏联同志的辛勤劳动表示感谢和慰问。苏联政府代表团最近通知我们，苏联部长会议决定把在苏联展览会陈列的物品在展览完毕后，全部赠送给中国。这种崇高友谊给正在建设社会主义的中国人民以极大的鼓舞。为此，我谨代表中国政府和人民向苏联政府和它的代表团表示深切的感谢。
    我们的国家正处在一个新的历史发展的阶段，我们正沿着苏联已走过的道路向着繁荣幸福的社会主义社会前进。我国人民正满怀信心地按着毛泽东主席的指示，准备在几个五年计划之内，把我们这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。为了实现这个伟大的任务，我们就必须克服我们在前进道路上的许多艰难困苦，因此就必须力戒虚夸和骄傲，勤勤恳恳，老老实实，更加努力学习苏联的先进经验，进一步巩固中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊，这是完成我们伟大的社会主义建设事业的一个重要的保证。
    周恩来总理最后提议：为中苏两国伟大的牢不可破的友谊日益巩固和发展干杯！为在我国建设事业中给我国人民巨大帮助的苏联专家的健康干杯！为苏联共产党和苏联政府领袖们的健康干杯！
    苏联部长会议副主席米高扬接着致词。他向苏联专家们说：在毛泽东主席领导下的伟大的中国人民欢庆国庆节的时候，周恩来总理设宴招待你们，这说明中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民对你们的工作给予了极高的评价。我们和中国人民紧紧地结合在一起，因为我们有一个共同的目标，这就是社会主义。我们帮助了中国人民，中国人民也帮助了我们，我们之间的这种互相帮助，不但是无私的，而且是如同兄弟一般的。有你们这一批优秀的同志在中国工作，苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民感到自豪。米高扬最后提议为中国人民，为中国共产党，为毛泽东主席、周恩来总理、中国共产党和中国人民政府的其他领导同志的健康干杯。

    苏联总顾问阿尔希波夫致词。他说：在中国人民伟大的节日——中华人民共和国成立第五周年纪念的时候，请允许我代表全体苏联专家向中国朋友们致热烈和衷心的祝贺。在中国工作的苏联专家很感激中国共产党和中国政府的爱护和关怀。我们向你们保证，苏联专家一定要完成苏联政府和苏联人民委托的任务。我们将尽一切力量，并以各方面的经验和知识来帮助中国工人、农民和知识分子进行伟大的建设和劳动。请允许我提议为中国朋友们，为工业、农业及文化等方面的领导干部，为和自己人民一起建设着社会主义社会的中国专家们干杯！为以周恩来总理为首的中国政府干杯！为中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席干杯！祝苏中两国人民的友谊更加巩固！
