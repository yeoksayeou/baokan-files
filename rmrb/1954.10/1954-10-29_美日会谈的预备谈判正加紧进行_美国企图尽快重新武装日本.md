Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: Preparatory talks for the US-Japan meeting are being conducted intensely in Washington, in order to pave the way for formal talks to begin after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida arrives in the United States in early November.

The preparatory stage of the talks has already demonstrated that the basic aim of the meeting is to increase the speed of Japanese rearmament. According to Japanese sources, Aiichi Kiichi, the Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry who is responsible for the preparatory talks, brought two plans related to Japanese rearmament from his country. One is the "Defense Agency's" plan to increase the total number of Japanese armed forces by approximately 34,000 in the 1955 fiscal year, and the other is a three-year plan drafted by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to increase Japanese arms production. Both plans have a common requirement, which is to request "aid" from the United States to complete them. According to the United Press, on the American side, Pentagon and State Department officials want to see the extent of Japan's increased military spending next year, and then "decide how much military aid—money and equipment—they can provide to support this increase."

Japan's economic difficulties are increasingly hindering the progress of Japanese rearmament. Therefore, this issue will also be addressed in the US-Japan talks. The two sides are discussing matters such as Japan purchasing surplus agricultural products from the United States and loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Japan is striving to be able to purchase surplus agricultural products worth more than 130 million US dollars from the United States next year, paying in Japanese yen. This figure is close to the amount of disguised "occupation fees" that Japan pays to the US military stationed in Japan in one year, but it is still less than one-fifth of Japan's trade deficit with the United States in the first half of this year under US control.

### 美日会谈的预备谈判正加紧进行  美国企图尽快重新武装日本

    美日会谈的预备谈判正加紧进行
    美国企图尽快重新武装日本
    【新华社二十八日讯】美日会谈的预备谈判正在华盛顿紧张地进行着，以便为日本首相吉田在十一月上旬到达美国后开始举行的正式会谈铺平道路。
    会谈的预备阶段已经说明，会谈的基本目的是为了增加日本重新武装的速度。据日本方面的消息说，参加预备谈判的日本负责人、通商产业相爱知揆一从国内带去了两个有关日本重新武装的计划。一个是“防卫厅”在一九五五会计年度把日本武装部队总共增加三万四千人左右的计划，还有一个是通商产业省拟订的增加日本军火生产的三年计划。这两个计划有着共同的要求，就是要求美国给予
  “援助”来完成。据合众社说，在美国方面，五角大楼和国务院官员要看日本明年度增加军备的程度，再来“决定他们能供给多大数量的军事援助——金钱和装备——来支持这种增加”。
    日本的经济困难愈来愈明显地妨碍着日本重新武装的进展。因此，在美日会谈中也要涉及这个问题。双方正在讨论日本向美国购买剩余农产品和国际复兴开发银行贷款等事情。日本争取能在明年以日元付款向美国购买价值一亿三千多万美元的剩余农产品。这个数字接近日本一年付给驻日美军的变相“占领费”的数额，可是还不到今年上半年在美国控制下的日本对外贸易的入超额的五分之一。
