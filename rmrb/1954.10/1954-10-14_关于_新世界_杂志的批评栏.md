   Criticism Column on "New World" Magazine
    Editor's Note: Recently, Soviet newspapers and magazines such as "Pravda," "Kommunist," and "Literaturnaya Gazeta," as well as some writers from various parts of the Soviet Union, have conducted serious criticism of the significant ideological errors committed by "New World," the organ of the Soviet Writers' Union, sharply pointing out the incorrect and harmful tendencies in the articles published by the magazine that comment on Soviet modern literature.
    The Presidium of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union discussed the erroneous articles published by "New World" magazine and issued a resolution "On the Errors of 'New World' Magazine." The resolution condemned "New World" magazine for promoting a line in some of its published articles that contradicted the Party's instructions on literature and art. The errors in these articles are: adopting an indifferent, nihilistic, and indiscriminate attitude of negation towards the achievements of Soviet literature; under the guise of superficially fighting the style of glossing over reality (i.e., the "no-conflict theory"), calling on writers to one-sidedly exaggerate the negative phenomena in reality, and even ridiculing works and writers that reflect the progressive phenomena in life; elevating so-called "writer's sincerity" to the position of the primary standard for evaluating literary works, while abolishing the ideological, social-class evaluation criteria that have been recognized in Soviet literature. This is a tendency to deviate from the principles of socialist realism. The resolution pointed out that as the organ of the Writers' Union, it should conduct systematic and timely struggles against all deviations from the principles of socialist realism, and against phenomena that attempt to separate Soviet literature from the life and struggles of the Soviet people, and from the urgent issues in the Party and state's policies. The resolution also conducted self-criticism on the Presidium and Secretariat of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union for not studying the issue of the ideological orientation of the Writers' Union's organ sufficiently. It also decided to remove A.T. Tvardovsky from the position of editor-in-chief of "New World" and appoint K.M. Simonov as the editor-in-chief of "New World."
    The resolution of the Presidium of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union (translated in the 17th issue of this year's "Literaturnaya Gazeta") and the article "Criticism Column on 'New World' Magazine" should arouse the attention of our country's writers, critics, literary and art organizations, and the editorial staff of their organs.
    Criticism and book reviews should determine the face, position, nature, and aesthetic discrimination of a magazine in many ways. Now, during the preparation for the Second Soviet Writers' Congress, the role of criticism and book reviews is particularly growing. Readers open the criticism and book review column of a magazine, hoping to find articles that summarize the rich experience of the development of Soviet literature, are permeated with the spirit of Party-mindedness, and are deeply concerned about the fate of our country's literature, hoping to find articles that can correctly determine how a certain work has enriched the literature of the motherland and our social life when evaluating the ideological and artistic characteristics of that work. Everyone knows Belinsky's wonderful saying: "No matter how bad a magazine is, no matter what state of decline it is in, as long as there is even one outstanding critical article in it, then this article will be read, and the magazine containing this article will be taken out of its long-hidden place and be able to see the light of day again. The power of a magazine is mainly due to its criticism." These words are still meaningful today.
    However, has "New World" magazine published many such articles in recent months? How well has this magazine fulfilled its extremely important task—studying and summarizing the creative experience of Soviet writers? Has this magazine fully and carefully paid attention to the development process of literature?
    "New World" magazine has published some interesting and rich articles during this period, but what dominates the magazine is mainly nihilistic and indiscriminate negation of the achievements of Soviet literature. Soviet public opinion has already justly evaluated V. Pomelantsev's article "On the Sincerity of Literature," considering that this article is ideologically bad, written by the author from an idealist standpoint, which opposes abstract sincerity to the ideological principles and Party principles of literature, and opposes it to the standards of truthfully reflecting real life. It is no accident that Pomelantsev declared in the first few lines of his article: "In the history of literature, writers have strived to tell the truth, not just propagandize." Lessons and principles seem to give headaches to people who have just graduated from school, but telling the truth can move people's hearts. However, isn't the Russian classical literature, which is rich in the most sublime and outstanding images, propaganda in the highest sense? Did classical literature therefore lose its sincerity and frankness? Pushkin compared the poet to a prophet; Lermontov shouted to the poet:
        Your poems fly like spirits above the heads of the people,
        And the echoes of sublime thoughts,
        Like the bells on the bell tower
        Resound in the days of joy and suffering of the people; Herzen called his newspaper "The Bell,"—doesn't all this show that they deeply understood the social role of literature and the mission of the artist as a teacher of life? Russian literature is good at expressing "lessons and principles" directly and openly, not secretly, and is not afraid of being blamed for propagandizing and teaching people; on the contrary, it is proud of this. Pomelantsev said that the epistolary novel found a path to the reader's heart due to its confessional nature. Is Lermontov's powerful poem "Meditation," Belinsky's letter to Gogol, or Mayakovsky's poem "At the Top of My Voice" less influential than the epistolary novel in terms of the power of influencing people?
    V. Pomelantsev did not see the achievements of Soviet literature because he forgot the most significant result of Soviet literature—high ideological quality and enormous realism of life. He indiscriminately accused writers of being hypocritical and insincere. He did not distinguish between a large number of honest Soviet artists and the shoddy workers who mixed into the ranks of Soviet writers, and the hypocritical and insincere opportunists who have been severely criticized by Soviet public opinion. Precisely because of this, Pomelantsev, with rare exceptions, found very little around him that he thought was worthy of support and approval. After "New World" magazine published Pomelantsev's article, it then published V. Abramov's article "The People of Collective Farms in Post-War Prose Works," which seemed to be a continuation of the former's tone.
    V. Pomelantsev condemned "the whole" of Soviet literature. V. Abramov only touched on a relatively small part of the literature, but attempted to obliterate and slander the labor of many writers who depicted collective farms. In Abramov's article, it is not difficult to hear echoes of Pomelantsev's nihilistic arguments, but these nihilistic arguments have already been used to evaluate certain literary phenomena and the vivid process of literary development.
    The advantages of the novels of S. Babaevsky, G. Nikolaeva, G. Medynski, and the advantages of other works on the theme of collective farms mentioned by V. Abramov, lie in the fact that they describe the sprouts of new things in the post-war collective farm life. Their weaknesses lie in resolving certain major conflicts too easily, and unnecessarily over-embellishing—for example—the image of Dudaryonov [Note 1]. However, despite the obvious shortcomings of the novels of S. Babaevsky and G. Nikolaeva, these novels have won over a large mass of readers. The issues raised in these novels are major and urgent. The images depicted in these novels are faithful to reality in their main and basic aspects. Even today, after several years, when the weaknesses of these works are exposed more clearly, these books have not lost their appeal to readers. Why does Abramov need to make a severe judgment on these works, which have played and continue to play a certain beneficial role, after the event? Why scrutinize them so critically?
    The most important duty of a critic is to support the new and advanced things that the artist has keenly observed in life and reflected in his own works. It must be reminded that V. Abramov should pay attention to this truth, because this critic attacks Sergei Dudaryonov's bold and innovative initiatives (Dudaryonov clearly realizes that without electrification and mechanization, it is impossible to further improve the collective farm in his hometown). He actually opposes those new and advanced things in the novel that are linked to the image of Dudaryonov. He opposes the task of consolidating the economy and organization of the collective farm with the idea of the five-year plan proposed by Dudaryonov.
    It is no coincidence that Abramov said that Dudaryonov's actions were "boldly" detached from real life, that his attempts were "arrogant," and that he resolutely opposed the calm and pragmatic people—Feodor Khokhryakov, who was regarded as the representative of the most conservative and backward viewpoints in the novel—to the so-called "protagonists who overindulge in fantasies."
    Abramov restored Khokhryakov's reputation, denounced Dudaryonov, stood on Khokhryakov's side in their dispute, and finally called Dudaryonov an "empty fantasist" and "a person who is not good at management," but he did not discover the most precious thing in Babaevsky's novel—the power of the good example clearly demonstrated by the people of the collective farm, that is, the ability to work creatively and wholeheartedly in combination with the prospects. It should be known that Khokhryakov's uncreative and opportunistic pragmatism is especially dangerous because it can lead to losing sight of the future, and it can prevent people from finding new and effective ways to fight for the further development of the region. Although this image has many imperfections, Dudaryonov's restless, always pursuing something, and not completely immune to romantic enthusiasm character can help people move forward, make people never stop, and cultivate people's characteristics of socialist consciousness.
    Generally speaking, Abramov is often distrustful and prejudiced against people's new qualities. He is like such a person: he cannot see the whole truth of new things, and consciously or unconsciously prostrates himself before cheap skepticism. Abramov ridiculed one of the protagonists of "Harvest"—the communist youth league member Alyosha. He believes that Flosika's behavior of giving 1,000 rubles to her own farm seems not very realistic, although this "practice" is completely suitable for the girl's character—she is frivolous and has a strong sense of reputation, and in her body, bad and good qualities are strangely combined. About her, the novel describes: "You can't live without 'making a fuss'."
    The entire content and all the arguments of V. Abramov's article are to denounce writers for being "insincere" and for not truthfully reflecting life, even if the author himself may not have mentioned the word "sincere" once.
    A spirit of indifferent skepticism towards Soviet literature permeates M. Livshitz's essay on M. Shaginyan's "Writer's Diary" [Note 2] and M. Sheglov's essay on O. Cherny's novel "Snegina's Opera" [Note 3]. Although there are some correct opinions in these two reviews in addition to incorrect opinions, the sarcastic tone and the very obvious disrespect for the writer make readers feel unpleasant and surprised.
    But the problem is not only the mocking tone of these two articles, but also the aestheticist position of the authors of these two articles. M. Livshitz's article is actually against literature actively participating in life. Critic M. Livshitz depicts the woman writer's argument with poisonous colors. He believes that this woman writer, who is not technically cultivated, lets herself intervene to solve complex technical problems, and thus becomes—according to Livshitz—"a megaphone for subjective impulses, rudeness, arbitrariness, and other strange things."
    Of course, a writer cannot study technical problems as thoroughly as an expert who has devoted his life to technology. It should be known that literature is first of all "anthropology." The writer only needs to involve technical problems to such an extent that it can help to reveal and show the relationship between people more deeply. But it cannot be ignored, and this ardent and sincere desire of the artist should not be supported: to intervene in the struggle between new and old things, to help new things to be established, and to support advanced figures. Here, Livshitz's sarcasm is unjustified. Literature should intervene in life in this way—this is what the rich experience of our writers has taught us, and the writing experience of M. Shaginyan also tells us this. Literature's intervention in life in this way has helped us to express advanced labor figures from practice and from the struggle to win over new things, and has also brought great practical benefits. Even if he is not an expert, but if he has a clear Party position and a broad social perspective, a writer can often judge things more deeply than an expert, and can observe life more sharply. This gives the writer the right to insist on his own mature and well-thought-out methods when solving certain problems.
    M. Livshitz's article is keen to oppose writers' active participation in life, while the young critic M. Sheglov wastes his enthusiasm in many ways on ridiculing the writer O. Cherny. The critic believes that Cherny almost played the role of a prophet of "earthquakes" and other "shocks" in the novel "Snegina's Opera" when he described the Party's intervention in the development of Soviet music (if we use Sheglov's sarcastic terms).
    In his speech at the meeting of music workers in 1948, A.A. Zhdanov mentioned that our Party had already severely criticized the formalism tendency in the music industry in 1936. The struggle against formalism has not stopped in the following years. Therefore, it is not contrary to the truth that the novelist made the characters in his novel consider the issues that were later resolved in the well-known resolutions of the Central Committee. The problem is not the "keenness of premonition" that Sheglov ridiculed. These issues did indeed make the music industry uneasy, and some people there had estimated the situation on the music front as required by the Party in principle.
    As for O. Cherny's protagonist going to the Party meeting, and suddenly becoming "another person" after the meeting, this is also irreproachable for O. Cherny. The long and difficult road, and the feeling of dissatisfaction with his own creation, made Snegina do this. At the meeting of the Party Central Committee, Snegina did find the answers to many questions that had troubled him, and under the influence of social criticism, he resolutely condemned his past works. Calling this episode in the novel a "very hypocritical component" is to reduce the effectiveness of the Party's criticism of artistic works.
    The article on O. Cherny's novel is one of M. Sheglov's first major works. There are also correct opinions in his analysis of this novel. Therefore, for young critics, it is more important to get rid of the dangerous aestheticist tendency, because this tendency often prevents him from evaluating events and phenomena from the perspective of life, and makes him draw incorrect conclusions. For example, in another article (on the novel "Russian Forest" [Note 4]), M. Sheglov denounced the author of this novel, saying that he depicted Gratzhianski as not "growing" in our Soviet reality, and that Gratzhianski's hateful face was not caused by the dark aspects of life after the revolution, but by years of criminal connection with the Tsar's secret service. This regret is strange. The Soviet living system is not an environment that raises people like Gratzhianski. Gratzhianski's inherent characteristics are caused by the remnants of the past. L. Leonov did not violate the truth, he emphasized that the basis of Gratzhianski's behavior is the remnants of the old system.
    By the way, Sheglov called Gratzhianski's connection with the Tsar's secret service itself one of many possible situations, and one of the "most detective-like" situations. But, in fact, the problem is much deeper. It is not the detective conflict, but the completely real living facts and events that attract the writer. Gratzhianski was afraid that others would expose his dark past, and he became associated with foreign spies. In this way, L. Leonov revealed the roots that connected Gratzhianski with the capitalist world. He pointed out not the disappearing "self-extinguishing scourge," but the dangerous and harmful figures.
    But what does the practical struggle have to do with aestheticists! We want to remind you that a few years ago, A. Gurvich published an article entitled "The Power of Positive Examples" in "New World" magazine. In this notorious article, A. Gurvich believed that V. Azhayev's novel [Note 5] essentially did not need to describe these guys from the enemy camp—traitors—and their connections with foreign countries.
    Speaking of the literary criticism articles published by "New World" magazine that run counter to socialist realism, we cannot but point out that the spirit of skepticism and the attitude of indiscriminately negating everything that permeates these articles have had a harmful impact on some papers and reviews published by "New World" magazine in recent months. "New World" magazine has criticized—and often not without reason—some books, magazines, and selected works of literature and art. However, has the magazine righteously supported many authors in its own space? Has it encouraged many people? Unfortunately, such articles are not published so much.
    "New World" magazine has a good tradition—criticizing magazines and selected works of literature and art in various states and republics. It often publishes such reviews. However, here it is usually accompanied by a tone of accusation. In "New World" magazine, severe criticisms were made of the "Kyrgyzstan" selected works of literature and art, the Smolensk selected works of literature and art, the Chkalov selected works of literature and art, the "Soviet Kazakhstan" magazine, and other publications. So, is it not worthwhile to publish even one review to support the good experience and fruitful work of the entire staff who edit the magazines of the republic or state and select the selected works of literature and art?
    Only by standing on a solid ideological and aesthetic position, only by evaluating literary phenomena with the interests of the Party and the people as a guide, and only by actively publicizing the Soviet state policies that are the foundation of the Soviet system can criticism complete its glorious and sublime role and correctly form public opinion. Unfortunately, the book review department of "New World" magazine has not completed its true task. Some articles and reviews that promote aestheticist viewpoints have appeared here. These articles and reviews oppose the active participation of literature in life, and express doubts about the first indispensable condition of socialist realism art, namely the Party standard of literature and the truthful description of life. This line of the magazine on literary issues not only fails to help us strictly estimate the achievements and shortcomings of our literature with a sense of ownership in the important period before the congress is held, and more deeply understand the tasks currently put forward by the Party and the state in front of Soviet writers, but instead openly puts aside the specific problems of literary and artistic creation and does not solve them.
    Our literature has many major problems that have not been solved yet. These problems can only be clarified smoothly through extensive creative criticism and open debate. However, calling for free commentary before the congress is not to say that people who deny the ideological foundation of Soviet literature and the Party standards of literature should be allowed to talk nonsense and make fallacies. There is nothing to argue about here. Here, we should expose the views that run counter to us!
    The articles by V. Pomelantsev, V. Abramov, and others are nihilistic and aestheticist articles. These articles cannot help the development of our literature. On the contrary, they can hinder and delay the development of our literature. Soviet writers should use all their talents in their works to show the multi-faceted boiling life of Soviet society, use various artistic methods and means to show various life processes, shape the image of modern positive figures, that is, the image of ordinary Soviet people, and show the beautiful qualities of people that they possess. In this regard, our critical circles should become very sympathetic and caring assistants to writers.
    The issues of the artistic skills of Soviet literature, as well as the diversification of styles and genres, are of great significance at present. However, the critics of "New World" magazine are full of enthusiasm for "overthrowing authority," and they portray all the writers as one. Abramov, when criticizing novels depicting collective farm life, did not see the difference in artistic techniques between Babaevsky and Nikolaeva, Medinsky and Malcev. Livshitz, when criticizing Shaginyan, was not interested in the characteristics of the female writer's artistic techniques. This kind of criticism that does not discover the individual characteristics of writers cannot help the development of our literature.
    Discussing some issues of socialist realism through creative free debate, discussing some issues of further deepening and enriching this method, discussing the typification of art and so on, can help writers achieve new achievements, and can help them create some excellent new works that truly and positively reflect the social life of Soviet society. The Party calls on our literary circles to strive in this direction. This is also the sublime obligation of the artists of the Soviet state.

### 关于“新世界”杂志的批评栏

专栏：

   关于“新世界”杂志的批评栏
    编者按：最近苏联“真理报”、“共产党人”杂志和“文学报”等报刊及苏联各地一些作家，对苏联作家协会机关刊物“新世界”所犯的重大思想错误进行了严肃的批评，尖锐地指出了该杂志发表的评论苏联现代文学的文章中的不正确的、有害的倾向。
    苏联作家协会理事会主席团讨论了“新世界”杂志所发表的错误的文章，作出了“关于‘新世界’杂志的错误”的决议。决议中斥责“新世界”杂志在它所发表的一些文章中宣传了和党在文艺方面的指示相违反的路线。这些文章的错误是：对苏联文学上的成就采取冷漠的虚无主义的和不分皂白地加以否定的态度；在表面上同粉饰太平的作风（即“无冲突论”）进行斗争的幌子下，号召作家去片面地夸大现实中的反面现象，甚至嘲笑那些表现了生活中的进步现象的作品和作家；把所谓“作家的真诚”提高到成为评价文学作品的首要标准的地位，而取消了苏联文学中已被公认的思想的、社会阶级的评价标准。这是脱离社会主义现实主义原则的倾向。决议指出作为作家协会的机关刊物，应当与一切脱离社会主义现实主义原则的偏向、与企图使苏联文学脱离苏联人民的生活和斗争、脱离党和国家政策中的迫切问题的现象进行系统的及时的斗争。决议中并对苏联作家协会理事会主席团和书记处对于作家协会的机关刊物的思想方针问题研究得不够，进行了自我批评。并决定解除阿·特·特瓦尔道夫斯基“新世界”主编的职务，委任康·米·西蒙诺夫为“新世界”主编。
    苏联作家协会理事会主席团的决议（译文载本年第十七号“文艺报”）及“关于‘新世界’杂志的批评栏”一文，应该引起我国作家、批评家、文学艺术团体及其机关刊物编辑人员的重视。
    批评和图书评介在很多方面应当决定杂志的面貌、它的立场和性质、它的美学鉴别力。现在，在第二次苏联作家代表大会的筹备期间，批评和图书评介的作用特别增长着。读者翻开杂志的批评和图书评介栏，希望从里面找到一些总结苏联文学发展的丰富经验、渗透着党性精神并对我国文学的命运深切关怀的文章，希望找到一些在评价某一作品的思想艺术特点时能正确地断定这一作品如何丰富了祖国的文学和我们的社会生活的文章。大家知道别林斯基这句绝妙的话：“一本杂志不管怎样坏，不管处在怎样衰落不振的情况下，只要它里面有那怕是一篇出色的批评文章，那么这篇文章就将被人们阅读，而载有这篇文章的杂志也将被人们从久藏的地方取出来，得以重见天日。杂志之有力量，主要是归功于它的批评。”这些话就是在今天也仍然是有意义的。
    可是，“新世界”杂志最近几个月来是否发表了很多这样的文章呢？这个杂志对于自己极重要的任务——研究和总结苏联作家的创作经验——执行得怎样呢？这个杂志对于文学的发展过程是否充分仔细地注视了呢？
    “新世界”杂志在这一时期内曾经发表了一些有意思的、内容丰富的文章，但是在杂志中占优势的主要是虚无主义的和不分皂白地否定苏联文学成就的言论。苏联舆论界已经公正地评价了弗·包米兰采夫的文章“论文学的真诚”，认为这篇文章在思想上是恶劣的，是作者从唯心主义立场写出来的，是把抽象的真诚同文学的思想性原则和党性原则对立起来了，同真实地反映现实生活的标准对立起来了。包米兰采夫并非偶然地在自己文章的头几行中宣称道：“在文学史上，作家都力求说真心话，而不仅仅宣传。”教训和道理似乎会使刚从学校毕业的人感到头痛，而说真心话却能感动人心。但是，难道说富有最崇高和卓越的形象的俄罗斯古典文学不是在最高意义下的宣传吗？难道说古典文学因此就丧失了真诚和坦白吗？普希金把诗人比作预言家；莱蒙托夫向诗人高呼：
        你的诗句像神灵飘飞在人群头上，
        而崇高思想的回声，
        像钟楼上的大钟
        响彻在人民欢庆和苦难的日子里；赫尔岑把自己的报纸叫作“钟”，——难道这一切不是表明他们深刻理解文学的社会作用和作为生活导师的艺术家的使命吗？俄罗斯文学善于直接公开地、而不是偷偷摸摸地表达“教训和道理”，也不怕别人责备它宣传和教训人，恰好相反，它却以此自豪。包米兰采夫说，书信体裁的小说由于自白的性质，找到了通向读者心灵的道路，难道莱蒙托夫的有力的诗篇“沉思”、别林斯基的给果戈理的信或马雅可夫斯基的诗篇“大声疾呼”，就感化的力量讲来不如书信体裁的小说吗？
    弗·包米兰采夫没有看到苏联文学的成就，因为他忘记了苏联文学最重大的成果——高度的思想性和巨大的生活真实性。他不分皂白地责备作家虚伪、不真诚，他没有把大批正直的苏联艺术家同混入苏联文学家队伍中来的粗制滥造者区别开来，同苏联舆论界所一直严厉斥责的虚伪而不真诚的投机取巧者区别开来。正因为如此，所以包米兰采夫除了稀有的例外情况，在自己周围很少发现他认为值得支持和赞同的东西。“新世界”杂志发表了包米兰采夫的文章之后，接着又发表了符·阿布拉莫夫的文章“战后散文作品中的集体农庄的人们”，这篇文章好像是前者论调的继续。
    弗·包米兰采夫斥责了“整个的”苏联文学。符·阿布拉莫夫只是涉及了文学中比较狭小的一部分，可是企图抹煞和诬蔑很多描写集体农庄的作家的劳动。在阿布拉莫夫的文章中不难听到包米兰采夫的虚无主义议论的回声，可是这种虚无主义的议论已经用来评价一定的文学现象和生动的文学发展过程了。
    斯·巴巴耶夫斯基、格·尼古拉耶娃、格·米丁斯基的小说的优点，以及符·阿布拉莫夫所讲到的其他以集体农庄为主题的作品的优点，就在于它们描写了战后集体农庄生活中新的事物的萌芽。它们的弱点就在于很轻易地解决某些重大的冲突，不必要地过分粉饰——举例来说——杜达林诺夫〔注一〕的形象。但是，尽管斯·巴巴耶夫斯基和格·尼古拉耶娃的小说有着很明显的缺点，可是这些小说却争取了广大的读者群众。这些小说所提出的问题是重大而又迫切的。这些小说中所描绘的形象在主要和基本方面是忠实于现实的。甚至在过了若干年后的今天，当这些作品的弱点暴露得更加明显的时候，这些书也没有丧失其对读者的吸引力。为什么阿布拉莫夫对这些曾经起过和继续起着一定的有益作用的作品，在事后还须要进行严厉的判决呢？为什么还向它们吹毛求疵地进行复试呢？
    批评家第一个最重要的职责，就是支持艺术家在生活中所锐敏观察到的而且在他自己作品中所反映的那些新的先进的东西。必须提醒符·阿布拉莫夫注意这一真理，因为这位批评家在自己的文章中攻击谢尔格依·杜达林诺夫的大胆的革新的创举（杜达林诺夫明确地认识到，要进一步提高本乡的集体农庄，没有电气化和机械化是不可能的），他实际上反对小说中与杜达林诺夫的形象相联系的那些新的先进的东西，他把巩固集体农庄的经济和组织的任务与杜达林诺夫所建议的五年计划的思想对立起来。
    阿布拉莫夫说杜达林诺夫的行动是“大胆地”脱离现实生活的，说他的企图是“狂妄的”，他坚决地把冷静的具有实际信念的人——小说中被当作最保守和落后的观点的代表者的菲道尔·鹤赫拉柯夫——与所谓“过分耽溺于幻想中的主人公们”对立起来，这都不是偶然的事情。
    阿布拉莫夫恢复了鹤赫拉柯夫的名声，斥责了杜达林诺夫，在他们的争论中站在鹤赫拉柯夫方面，最后把杜达林诺夫叫作“空虚的幻想家”和“不善于经营的人”，但是他没有发现斯·巴巴耶夫斯基小说中最宝贵的东西——集体农庄的人们所明显表现出来的好的榜样的力量，即善于同远景相结合地、创造性地、全心贯注地工作的本领。要知道鹤赫拉柯夫的毫无创造力量的投机取巧的实际主义是尤其危险的，因为它会导致迷失前途，它会妨碍人们寻找新的有效的方法去为本地区的进一步发展而斗争。虽然这一形象有许多不完善的地方，可是杜达林诺夫的不安静的、总是追求着什么东西的、与浪漫热情并非绝缘的性格却能帮助人们前进，使人们决不止步不前，并培养人们具有社会主义觉悟的特点。
    一般说来，阿布拉莫夫对于人们的新品质往往是不相信并抱有成见的，他就像这样的一个人：看不见新事物的全部真象，自觉或不自觉地拜倒在廉价的怀疑主义面前。阿布拉莫夫嘲笑“收获”的主人公之一——共青团员阿廖夏。他认为弗洛茜卡赠送给自己农庄一千卢布的行为似乎也不大真实，虽然这一“做法”是与这个姑娘的性格完全适合的，——她性情浮躁，名誉心很强，在她身上坏的和好的两种品质奇异地结合在一起，关于她，小说中这样描述道：“不‘吵吵闹闹’是不能过日子的。”
    符·阿布拉莫夫文章的整个内容和全部论据都是斥责作家“不真诚”，斥责他们没有真实地反映生活，即使“真诚”这个字眼作者自己也许一次也没有提到过。
    一种对苏联文学的冷漠的怀疑主义精神贯穿着米·李夫雪兹的论玛·沙基娘的“作家日记”〔注二〕和姆·谢格洛夫论奥·契尔尼的长篇小说“斯涅金的歌剧”〔注三〕这两篇文章。虽然在这两篇评论中除了不正确的见解之外还有一些正确的意见，但是评论中的讥讽的幸灾乐祸的口吻和对作家非常明显的不尊重的态度却使读者感到不愉快和惊愕。
    但是问题并不只在于这两篇文章的嘲弄口吻，而且在于这两篇文章的作者的唯美主义立场。米·李夫雪兹的文章实际上是反对文学积极参与生活的。批评家米·李夫雪兹用有毒的色彩描绘这位女作家的论点，他认为这位女作家在技术上没有修养，却让自己插手来解决复杂的技术问题，因而就成为——按照李夫雪兹的说法——“主观冲动、蛮横无理、任性专断以及其他古怪东西的传话筒。”
    当然，作家不能像一个毕生献身给技术的专家那么彻底地研究技术问题。要知道，文学首先就是“人学”。作家涉及技术问题只须到这样的一种程度，即能帮助更深刻地揭示和表明人们之间的关系就行了。但是不能不看到，而且也不能不支持艺术家的这种热烈的真诚的愿望：干预新事物和旧事物的斗争，帮助新事物确立起来，而且支持先进的人物。在这里，李夫雪兹的讽刺是毫无理由的。文学要这样地干预生活，——这是我们作家的丰富经验教导我们的，而且玛·沙基娘的写作经验也这样告诉我们。文学这样地干预生活，曾经帮助我们从实际中、从争取新事物的斗争中去表现先进的劳动人物，同时也曾经带来很大的实际的利益。即使不是专家，但是如果具有明确的党的立场和广阔的社会眼界，一个作家往往比一个专家能更深刻地判断事物，能更锐敏地观察生活。这就使作家有权利在解决某些问题时坚持自己所提出的成熟的、经过深思熟虑的办法。
    米·李夫雪兹的文章是热中于反对作家积极参与生活，而年青的批评家姆·谢格洛夫在很多方面却把自己的满腔热情浪费在对作家奥·契尔尼的嘲笑上。这位批评家认为，契尔尼在“斯涅金的歌剧”这一长篇小说中描写党干涉苏联音乐的发展的时候，几乎扮演了“地震”和其他“震动”的预言者这个角色（如果用谢格洛夫的讽刺术语来说的话）。
    安·阿·日丹诺夫在一九四八年音乐工作者会议上发言时曾经提到，我们党还在一九三六年就严厉地斥责了音乐界中的形式主义倾向。对形式主义的斗争就是在以后的年代里也没有停止过。因此，小说家使自己小说中的人物考虑那些以后才在中央委员会的众所周知的决议中得到解决的问题，这是与真理不相违背的。问题并不在于谢格洛夫所嘲笑的“预感的敏锐性”。这些问题的确也曾经使得音乐界不安，那里有些人曾经原则地、像党所要求那样地估计了音乐战线上的情况。
    至于奥·契尔尼的主人公去开党的会议，开完会出来突然间就变成了“另外的人”，这对奥·契尔尼方面也是无可指责的。漫长而又艰难的道路，对自己创作的不满意的感觉，使得斯涅金这样作了。在出席党中央的会议时，斯涅金的确找到了很多曾经使他苦恼过的问题的答案，他在社会批评的影响下坚决地斥责了自己过去的作品。把小说中的这一段插曲叫作“非常虚伪的成份”，就是降低和减少党对艺术作品的批评的成效。
    论奥·契尔尼长篇小说的这篇文章，是姆·谢格洛夫最初的大作品之一。在他对这一长篇小说的分析中也有正确的意见。因此，对于年青的批评家来说，更重要的是摆脱危险的唯美主义的倾向，因为这种倾向常常妨碍他从生活的立场来评价事件和现象，而使他作出不正确的结论来。例如，在另一篇文章中（论长篇小说“俄罗斯的森林”〔注四〕），姆·谢格洛夫斥责了这部长篇小说的作者，说他把格拉节安斯基描写成不是在我们苏联的现实环境里“生长”起来的，说格拉节安斯基的可憎的面貌不是革命后生活中的阴暗方面所造成的，而是与沙皇暗探局进行多年犯罪的联系所产生的。这种惋惜是令人奇怪的。苏联的生活制度并不是豢养格拉节安斯基这类人的环境。格拉节安斯基是非常敌视苏联生活制度的。格拉节安斯基所固有的特点是过去的各种残余所造成的。尔·列昂诺夫并没有违背真理，他着重指出，格拉节安斯基的行为的基础是旧制度的残余。
    顺便说一句，谢格洛夫把格拉节安斯基和沙皇暗探局的联系本身称为不过是很多可能的情况的一种，而且是“最富于侦探性质的”情况的一种。但是，事实上问题却更深刻得多了。并不是侦探的冲突，而是完全实在的活生生的事实和事件吸引了作家。格拉节安斯基害怕别人揭露自己黑暗的过去，而和外国的间谍发生了联系。这样，尔·列昂诺夫就揭露了把格拉节安斯基和资本主义世界联系起来的根源，他指出的不是正在消失的“自行绝迹的祸害”，而是危险的和有害的人物。
    但是，实际的斗争和唯美主义者又有什么关系呢！我们要提醒一下，几年前阿·古尔维奇在“新世界”杂志上发表了一篇题名为“正面榜样的力量”的文章，在这篇臭名远扬的文章中，阿·古尔维奇曾经认为，弗·阿札耶夫的长篇小说〔注五〕从敌对阵营的人们——叛徒们——和外国的联系来描写这些家伙，实质上是不需要的。
    谈到“新世界”杂志所发表的和社会主义现实主义背道而驰的文学批评的文章，我们不能不指出，这些文章中贯穿着的怀疑主义精神和不分皂白地否定一切的态度，对“新世界”杂志最近几个月所发表的一些论文和评论都给了一种有害的影响。“新世界”杂志批评了——而且往往不是没有根据地批评了——一些书籍、杂志、文艺作品选集。但是，该杂志是否在自己的篇幅上理直气壮地支持过很多作者呢？是否鼓励过很多人呢？可惜，这样的文章发表的并不那么多。
    “新世界”杂志有一个好的传统——批评各州和各共和国的杂志和文艺作品选集。它经常刊登这样的评论。但是，在这里通常总是带有指责的口吻。在“新世界”杂志上，对“吉尔吉斯斯坦”文艺作品选集、斯摩棱斯克文艺作品选集、契卡洛夫文艺作品选集、“苏维埃哈萨克斯坦”杂志以及其他刊物进行了严厉的批评。那么难道说就不值得发表那怕是一篇评论来支持主编共和国或州的杂志和编选文艺作品选集的全体人员的好的经验和富有成效的工作吗？
    只有站在牢固的思想立场和美学立场上的时候，只有以党和人民的利益为指南而评价文学现象的时候，只有积极地宣传作为苏维埃制度生命基础的苏维埃国家政策的时候，批评才能完成自己光荣的崇高的作用，才能正确地形成社会舆论。可惜，“新世界”杂志的书刊评介部没有完成自己真正的任务。这里出现了一些宣扬唯美主义观点的文章和评论，这些文章和评论反对文学积极参与生活，对社会主义现实主义艺术第一个不可缺少的条件即文学的党性标准和生活的真实描写表示怀疑。该杂志在文学问题上的这种路线，不但不能帮助在代表大会召开前的重要时期以主人翁的态度来严格地估计我们文学的成就和缺点，更深刻地认识党和国家目前在苏联作家面前所提出的任务，反而明目张胆地把文艺创作的具体问题搁置一边不去解决。
    我们的文学有很多还未解决的大问题。通过广泛的创造性评论和公开的意见斗争，才能顺利地弄清楚这些问题。但是号召在代表大会召开前开展自由的评论，这决不是说，应该让那些否认苏联文学思想基础和文学党性标准的人们信口雌黄，大发谬论。这里是没有什么可争辩的。这里应当揭露和我们背道而驰的观点！
    弗·包米兰采夫、符·阿布拉莫夫和其他等人的文章是虚无主义的、唯美主义的文章。这些文章不能帮助我们文学的发展，恰好相反，却能够阻碍和拖延我们文学的发展。苏联作家应该在自己的作品中以自己的全部才能来表现苏联社会多方面的沸腾的生活，以各种各样的艺术方法和手段来展示各种各样的生活过程，塑造现代正面人物的形象、即普通苏联人的形象，并且表现出他们所具有的人的美好的品格来。在这方面我们的批评界应当成为对作家很同情和关心的助手。
    苏联文学的艺术技巧以及风格和体裁的多样化等问题，在目前具有着巨大的意义。可是“新世界”杂志的批评家们充满着“推翻权威”的热情，竟把所有的作家描绘成一个模样。阿布拉莫夫在批评描写集体农庄生活的小说的时候，没有看出巴巴耶夫斯基和尼古拉耶娃、米丁斯基和马利采夫之间的艺术手法的不同之处。李夫雪兹在批评沙基娘的时候，对于这位女作家的艺术手法的特点并不感兴趣。这类不去发现作家个人特点的批评，是不能够帮助我们文学的发展的。
    通过创造性的自由辩论来讨论社会主义现实主义的若干问题，来讨论进一步加深和丰富这一方法的若干问题，来讨论关于艺术的典型化以及其他等等的问题，这能帮助作家获得新的成就，能帮助他们创造出一些真实地和积极地反映苏联社会生活的卓越的新作品。党号召我们的文学界向这方面努力。这也就是苏维埃国家的艺术家的崇高的义务。
