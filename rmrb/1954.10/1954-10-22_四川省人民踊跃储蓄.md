    The people of Sichuan Province are enthusiastically participating in patriotic savings, and various savings deposits are constantly increasing. According to statistics from the Sichuan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China as of the end of September, the total amount of people's savings in the province has reached 610 billion yuan, an increase of 190 billion yuan compared to the end of June this year, and an increase of 320 billion yuan compared to the end of September last year. In 19 cities and counties including Chengdu and Zigong, the People's Bank has a total of 400,000 urban savings accounts, among which fixed deposit accounts are gradually increasing. The proportion of fixed deposits has accounted for more than 50% of the total savings. After selling 20,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, the Daguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongguan Township, Nanchong County, deposited 6.5 million yuan in the state bank; Huang Xingfa, a farmer in Shuikou Village, Luoxin Township, Longchang County, has saved 560,000 yuan after selling grain, and he plans to continue selling 400 jin of grain and deposit all the money earned from selling the grain into the bank.
    In order to encourage the people of the province to participate more enthusiastically in savings, the People's Bank of China in Sichuan Province implemented new urban savings deposit regulations in September this year and launched "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" in rural areas.

    四川省人民踊跃储蓄
    四川省人民踊跃参加爱国储蓄，各项储蓄款不断增加。据中国人民银行四川省分行截至九月底的统计，全省人民储蓄款已达六千一百亿元，比今年六月底增加了一千九百亿元，比去年九月底增加了三千二百亿元。在成都、自贡等十九个市、县，人民银行共拥有四十万户城市储蓄户，其中定期储蓄户正逐步增加，定期储蓄款的比重，已占总储蓄款的百分之五十以上。南充县东观乡大光农业生产合作社在把二万斤余粮卖给国家以后，向国家银行储蓄了六百五十万元；隆昌县锣心乡水口村农民黄兴发卖粮后已储蓄五十六万元，他还准备继续卖粮四百斤，把卖粮得到的钱全部存入银行。
    四川省各地人民银行为了鼓励全省人民更加踊跃地参加储蓄，在今年九月施行了新的城市储蓄存款章程，并在农村举办了“粮棉优待储蓄”。
