    Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative Actively Sells Surplus Grain
    The members of the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, decided to sell 780,000 jin of rice to the state as soon as the autumn harvest was completed, which is 120,000 jin more than last year. Yang Zhaoqing, the director of the cooperative, said: "Our cooperative has 61 member households, and each household can sell an average of more than 12,700 jin of grain to the state, supporting industrial construction. This is the greatest honor for all members after a year of labor." Recently, the members of the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative have been tidying up the rice fields, drying and cleaning the rice to sell to the state.
    The 1,250 mu of rice paddies in the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative yielded an average of 740 jin of rice per mu this year, exceeding the original production increase plan by 5.6 percent, and increasing the average yield per mu by 90 jin compared with last year. In addition to the cooperative's more than 150 mu of corn, beans, etc., this year, the total grain output of the entire cooperative increased by nearly one-third compared with last year. The members said that without the help of the state's industry, there would be no such good harvest this year.
    The land near Dachenzhuang used to be a barren saline-alkali beach, and it was difficult to reclaim even a few mu of cultivated land. Yang Zhenru, a model agricultural worker and the founder of the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, had only reclaimed ten mu of land after three years of hard work. In 1950, the state built an electric pumping station on the Jiyun River near Dachenzhuang. It was equipped with electric motors and large-diameter water pumps transported from Shanghai, Tianjin and other places. This electric pumping station has a large water output, which can wash away alkali and reclaim wasteland, making the land moist and easy to reclaim. At the same time, the cost of electric water is low and irrigation is timely. After the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative used electric water, the rice paddies quickly increased by more than three times, and the yield per mu of rice paddies also increased from 200 to 300 jin in the past to 600 to 700 jin. This year, the state-owned Hebei Province Third Tractor Station, newly built by the Hebei Provincial People's Government in Lutai Town near Dachenzhuang, also helped the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative to plow 870 mu of land, so that the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative saved a lot of labor this year and invested it in intensive farming and strengthening the later field management, so this year's output has increased compared with last year.

    大陈庄农业生产合作社积极出卖余粮
    河北省宁河县大陈庄农业生产合作社的全体社员，在秋收刚完毕就决定把七十八万斤稻谷卖给国家，比去年多卖十二万斤。社主任杨兆庆说：“我们合作社六十一户社员，今年平均每一户社员能卖给国家一万二千七百多斤粮食，支援工业建设，这是全社社员经过一年劳动后的最大光荣。”最近大陈庄农业生产合作社的社员正在整理稻场，把稻谷晒干扬净卖给国家。
    大陈庄农业生产合作社一千二百五十亩水稻，今年平均每亩产稻谷七百四十斤，超过原订增产计划百分之五点六，比去年每亩平均产量增加九十斤。加上今年社里的一百五十多亩玉米、豆子等，今年全社粮食的总产量比去年增加将近三分之一。社员们说要没有国家工业对他们的帮助，决不会出现今年这样的丰收。
    大陈庄附近的土地过去原是一片荒芜的盐碱滩地，想开辟几亩耕地很困难。农业劳动模范、大陈庄农业生产合作社的创始人杨振儒，过去经过三年的辛勤劳动，总共开荒不过十亩地。一九五零年国家在大陈庄附近的蓟运河边修建了一座电力扬水站。装备了上海、天津等地运来的电动机和大口径水泵。这座电力扬水站出水大，能洗碱拉荒，使地皮湿润便于开荒，同时电力浇水成本又低，灌溉及时。大陈庄农业生产合作社使用电力浇水后，稻田很快就增加了三倍多，每亩稻田的产量也由过去的二、三百斤提高到六、七百斤。今年，河北省人民政府在大陈庄附近的芦台镇新建的国营河北省第三拖拉机站，又帮助大陈庄农业生产合作社翻耕了八百七十亩土地，使大陈庄农业生产合作社今年节约了很多劳力投入精耕细作和加强后期田间管理，因此今年的产量比去年又有提高。
