    Hong Kong and Macau Compatriots Thank the Soviet Union for its Great Assistance to China

    Hong Kong and Macau compatriots warmly support the Sino-Soviet Communiqué.

    Chen Yaocai, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, said: The Sino-Soviet Communiqué demonstrates the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. With the Soviet Union's technical and equipment assistance, our socialist construction will progress even faster. Workers in Hong Kong's electric light, dockyard, foreign affairs, textile dyeing, and motorcycle industries were very excited after reading the Sino-Soviet Communiqué. Some workers said with emotion: When our country has sufficient defense capabilities, the Soviet Union will withdraw its troops from the Lushunkou naval base and transfer the equipment to our country free of charge; it will also completely transfer Soviet shares in Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies, which play an active role in developing our country's economy, to our country. From these facts, we can see that the Soviet Union's assistance to our country is sincere and selfless.

    When some middle school and primary school principals and film workers talked about the Sino-Soviet Communiqué, they all believed that such sincere friendship and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union to our country had never been seen in the world, and could not be compared with the United States' aggressive "aid" to other countries. They believe that the unity between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful force for peace and plays a significant role in safeguarding world peace.

    Patriotic industrialists and businessmen in Hong Kong realized from the Sino-Soviet Communiqué that the Soviet Union is truly China's loyal and reliable friend. The manager of a certain company said: "The United States used to use 'US Aid' to 'assist' China, but what we saw in the past was American soldiers rampaging on our territory, a large number of unsalable American goods being shipped to our country for dumping, and American military supplies being handed over to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to suppress the people. In comparison, it is clear who is a friend and who is an enemy."

    Heads of various trade unions and organizations in Macau also made statements supporting the Sino-Soviet Communiqué. Liang Pei, Chairman of the Macau Federation of Trade Unions, said: Relying on the close cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, we have sufficient strength to smash any plot by aggressors to undermine peace in the Far East and the world. The person in charge of the Macau Democratic Women's Federation said: The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country cannot be found in capitalist countries. The person in charge of the Macau Chinese Education Association said: Countless facts have made us deeply realize that the Soviet Union is a true friend of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    香港澳门同胞感谢苏联对我国的伟大援助
    香港、澳门同胞热烈拥护中苏会谈公报。
    港九工会联合会理事长陈耀材说：中苏会谈公报说明了中苏两国人民间的伟大友谊。我国社会主义建设事业，有了苏联的技术、设备上的帮助，将进展得更快。香港电灯、船坞、洋务、纺织染业、摩托车业等业工人看了中苏会谈公报后，都非常兴奋。有些工人感动地说：当我国有足够的国防力量时，苏联就将军队撤出旅顺口海军根据地，并把设备无偿地移交给我国；还将在发展我国经济中起积极作用的中苏股份公司中的苏联股份完全移交我国。从这些事实可以看到苏联对我国的援助，是诚心诚意和大公无私的。
    一些中学、小学校长和电影工作者在谈到这次中苏会谈公报时，都认为像苏联对我国这样诚恳的友谊和无私的援助，是世界上从来没有过的，更不是美国对其他国家进行侵略性的“援助”所能相比的。他们认为中苏两国的团结是一个强大的和平力量，对保卫世界和平起着重大作用。
    香港爱国的工商界人士从中苏会谈公报中体会到，苏联真正是中国忠实可靠的朋友。某公司经理说：“美国过去也常用‘美援’来‘援助’中国，但我们过去看到的，是美国大兵在我们国土上横行，大批滞销的美国货运到我国倾销，把美国军火交给蒋介石卖国贼镇压人民。两者相比，就清清楚楚地看到谁是朋友，谁是敌人。”
    澳门各工会、社团的负责人也发表谈话，拥护中苏会谈公报。澳门工会联合总会理事长梁培说：依靠中苏两国人民亲密的合作，就有足够力量粉碎任何侵略者破坏远东和世界和平的阴谋。澳门民主妇女联合会负责人说：苏联对我国无私的援助，是在资本主义国家中找不到的。澳门中华教育会负责人说：无数事实使我们深深体会到苏联是中国人民和世界人民的真正朋友。　（新华社）
