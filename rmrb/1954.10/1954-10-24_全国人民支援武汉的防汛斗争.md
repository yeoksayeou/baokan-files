Wuhan People Overcame the Greatest Flood in History

    The People of the Whole Country Support Wuhan's Flood Control Struggle
    Fang Ge, He Luo
    During those tense days of the flood control struggle in Wuhan, the people of the whole country supported the 1.5 million people of Wuhan who were fighting the floods with boundless concern.
    Centered on Beijing, extending south to Guangdong, north to Heilongjiang, east to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, and west to Sichuan and Gansu, massive amounts of materials were continuously sent to aid Wuhan. In the early stages of flood control, a large number of麻袋 (mádài, burlap sacks) were needed to reinforce and raise the embankments. From July 7th to 14th, more than 100 train cars, approximately 1.8 million sacks, were transported from various regions. In late July, the river water gradually approached the newly constructed secondary dikes. These secondary dikes had not been tested by floods, and the potentially increasing wind and waves posed a serious threat. The Municipal Flood Control Headquarters decided to wrap all the outer slopes of the secondary dikes with reed mats. Upon learning of this urgent situation, the Dalian Native Produce Company, within a week, had its manager bring 100,000 reed mats to Wuhan. Almost all the secondary dikes in Hankou were wrapped with this batch of reed mats. On August 19th, the Wuhan Customs House water level rose to its highest level of 29.73 meters. A large number of grass bags were needed on the dikes. The Wuhan Flood Control Headquarters made a phone call to the Jilin City Finance Committee. Upon receiving the call, the Jilin City Finance Committee immediately established a "Joint Office for Supporting Wuhan Flood Control Materials," mobilizing all cadres to collect grass bags overnight. Using the fastest methods, they completed all necessary procedures. The next day—August 20th—a train loaded with grass bags departed from Jilin. August was the time when the water level in Wuhan was at its highest, and the possibility of strong winds and waves was even greater. The Flood Control Headquarters decided to build a wave-resistant log raft around the Hankou embankment and the outer edges of Wuchang's floodwalls. This was a large-scale project that required a large amount of timber, bamboo cables, steel wire ropes, anchors, and other materials. Furthermore, the floodwaters were rising rapidly, and strong winds and waves could strike at any time, making the situation extremely urgent. At this time, Hubei Province quickly provided timber support; handicraft workers in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangzhou accelerated the weaving of bamboo cables and sent them; and workers in Shanghai worked overtime day and night, rushing to produce 1,700 large iron anchors, each weighing 100 kilograms or 50 kilograms, and sent them to Wuhan. This enabled Wuhan to quickly complete the 125-li (approximately 62.5 kilometers) long wave-resistant log raft, effectively reducing the threat of wind and waves under high-water conditions.
    In a short period, transporting a large number of flood control materials and equipment was a challenging task. The Ministry of Railways and other relevant departments overcame various difficulties, ensuring that flood control materials were transported as soon as they arrived. Each train car displayed a "red note" indicating that it should not stop along the way and should be given priority, speeding towards Wuhan. The Hubei Provincial Inland Waterway Transportation Administration organized 5,236 civilian boats to serve flood control efforts in Wuhan within a short time.
    The people of Wuhan will forever remember the enormous and selfless assistance and cooperation provided by the farmers in the vast areas of Hubei Province under the leadership of the Party and the government when the flood peaks from the upper reaches of the rivers arrived one after another. They planned and implemented flood diversion and storage measures, greatly reducing the serious threat to Wuhan caused by the sudden rise in water levels due to successive flood peaks. Farmers in Hubei Province also sacrificed their own production to participate in the flood control struggle in Wuhan.
    Among the 200,000 people in the Wuhan flood control army, more than 37,000 were personnel sent by the central government and various regions to Wuhan to participate in the flood control struggle. These included People's Liberation Army troops, various engineering and technical personnel, divers, electrical workers, 埽坝 (sàobà, fascine dam) workers, and farmers with rich flood control experience.
    When the suburban areas of Hankou within the Zhanggong Dike were flooded, and when the Zhanggong Dike was under attack from both external floods and internal waterlogging, the mechanical workers from the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources, who had fought on the construction sites of the great water conservancy projects such as the Guanting Reservoir, the Chaobai River, the Yongding River, and the Duliu River, brought pumps to Wuhan; when the pumps supported by all parts of the country were transported to Wuhan, and Wuhan's power supply was facing difficulties, more than 130 employees of the North China Electric Power Management and Construction Engineering Bureau's train power station arrived in Wuhan along with the power generation train; When Wuhan's flood control was entering a tense decisive stage, and when there were the most dangers to the dikes, the Chinese People's Navy and the Railway Corps sent diving personnel, and with the assistance of the Air Force, arrived in Wuhan; In order to strengthen the flood resistance capacity of the Wutai Sluice in Wuchang, it was necessary to quickly build 埽坝 (sàobà, fascine dams) on a large scale, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission selected 63 埽坝 (sàobà, fascine dam) workers to come to Wuhan. Wang Shulin, a 埽坝 (sàobà, fascine dam) worker from the Yellow River, was not originally among the personnel transferred to Wuhan to support flood control. Due to his repeated requests, he was approved by the leadership. He didn't even think about going home to say a word or packing a simple luggage. He patted the dirt on his hat and said, "Let's go, disaster relief is like fighting a fire!" He set off with everyone. As soon as they arrived in Wuhan, they plunged into the tense battle, regardless of the fatigue of the journey. Tang Shusen, a diver from the Railway Corps, participated in the rescue work near the Wuhan Customs House on the second day of his arrival, exploring the danger and plugging leaks underwater. He started working at dusk, and when he came out of the water for the last time, it was already dawn the next day. His hands were swollen high, and the sleeves of his diving suit were stained with blood from his wrists.
    In order to supply the needs of the people in Wuhan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan and other places transported a large amount of rice. The amount transported in August alone was enough for the people of the whole city to eat for a month and a half. More than 5,000 tons of white coal were transported from Jiaozuo. Various kinds of vegetables and non-staple foods were transported from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shantou, and Taiyuan. The total amount of vegetables transported in every day was 800,000 to 900,000 kilograms. The people of Wuhan had experienced the tragic life of the 1931 flood; in that year's flood, there were more than 230,000 homeless and hungry people, and more than 32,000 people died. As an old resident said: "At that time, prices rose faster than the water!" And you couldn't buy things even at high prices. Now prices are stable and supplies are sufficient. Surrounded by floods, people ate雪里红 (xuělǐhóng, pickled mustard greens) transported by ships and eggs transported by express trains. And in distant cities, some people are eagerly asking: "We have potatoes and dried fish, do you need them?"
    The people of Wuhan are now celebrating their brilliant victory in flood control, and when examining their achievements and summarizing their experiences, people put the leadership of the Party and the support of the people of the whole country at the forefront of the reasons for their victory. The people of Wuhan will never forget the meticulous care and enormous assistance they received from the people of the whole country during those tense and difficult days.

    全国人民支援武汉的防汛斗争
    方歌、何洛
    武汉在防汛斗争那些紧张的日子里，全国人民以无限关切的心情支援着和洪水搏斗的武汉一百五十万人民。
    以北京为中心，南到广东、北到黑龙江，东到江苏、浙江和上海，西到四川和甘肃，都源源送去大量物资援助武汉。在防汛初期，加固加高堤防需要大量的麻袋，在七月七日到十四日，各地就运来了一百多车皮，约一百八十万条。七月下旬，江水逐渐接近新筑起来的子堤了。子堤没有经受过洪水的考验，可能增大的风浪对子堤的威胁更其严重，市防汛总指挥部决定用芦席把所有子堤外坡包住。大连土产公司知道这一紧急情况以后，在一星期以内就由公司经理带着十万张芦席到达武汉。汉口的子堤差不多全是用这批芦席包起来的。八月十九日，武汉关水位升到二九·七三公尺的最高水位，堤上需要用大量草袋，武汉防汛总指挥部打了一个电话给吉林市财委，吉林市财委接到电话后，立即成立了
  “支援武汉防汛物资联合办公室”，动员所有干部，连夜把草袋收集起来，以最快的工作方法，办好各种应该办好的手续，第二天——八月二十日，满载草袋的火车就从吉林出发了。八月，是武汉水位最高的时候，风大浪猛的可能性更大了，防汛指挥部决定环绕汉口堤岸和武昌外沿的防水墙筑一道防浪木排。这是一项规模巨大的工程，需要大量的木料、篾缆、钢丝绳、铁锚和其他物资，而且洪水猛涨，大风浪随时可能袭来，时间非常急迫。这时，湖北省迅速支援了木料；江西、湖南和广州等地的手工业工人加紧编织了篾缆送来；上海的工人们日夜加班，在短短几天内赶制了一千七百只一百公斤或五十公斤的大铁锚送来。这就使武汉市能很迅速地完成了长达一百二十五华里的防浪木排，及早地有效地减少了高水位下风浪的威胁。
    在短短的时间内，要运送大批的防汛物资器材，是艰巨的任务。铁道部和其他有关部门，克服了各种困难，做到了防汛物资随到随运。每节车皮都挂着表示沿途不停，优先挂车的“红笺”，飞快地驶向武汉。湖北省内河航运管理处在短短的时间内，组织了五千二百三十六只民船为武汉防汛服务。
    武汉人民将永远记得，当江河的上游洪峰接踵而至时，湖北省广大地区农民在党和政府领导下所作的巨大的、无私的援助和配合。他们有计划地采取了分洪和蓄洪措施，大大减轻了洪峰接踵而来所形成的水位骤涨对武汉市的严重威胁。湖北省的农民还不惜放下自己的生产，赶来参加武汉的防汛斗争。
    在武汉二十万人的防汛大军中，有三万七千多人是中央和各地派来武汉参加防汛斗争的人员，其中包括解放军部队、各种工程技术人员、潜水人员、电机工人、埽坝工人和富有防汛经验的农民。
    当张公堤内汉口郊区渍水成灾的时候，当张公堤处在外洪内渍两面夹攻的时候，曾经战斗在官厅水库、潮白河、永定河、独流入海等伟大水利建设工程工地的中央水利部的工程总局的机械工人们，带着抽水机来到了武汉；当全国各地支援的抽水机运到武汉，而武汉电力供应感到困难的时候，华北电业管理修建工程局列车发电站的全体职工一百三十多人随同发电列车到达了武汉；在武汉防汛将进入紧张的决战阶段，堤防险情最多的时候，中国人民海军部队、铁道兵部队派了潜水员工，在空军部队协助运送下，到达武汉；为了加强武昌武泰闸的抗洪能力，需要大规模地迅速地修筑埽坝，黄河水利委员会就挑选了六十三位埽坝工人来到了武汉。黄河埽坝工人王树林，原来调到武汉支援防汛的人员中没有他，由于他的一再请求，才得到领导上的批准，他甚至没有想到回家说一声，或是收拾一个简单的行装，他拍了拍帽子上的泥土，说：“走，救灾如救火！”就这样随同大伙出发了。他们一到达武汉，不顾旅途的疲劳，就投入了紧张的战斗。铁道兵团潜水员唐树森在到达的第二天，就参加了武汉关附近的抢险工作，在水下探查险情，堵塞漏洞，黄昏时候开始工作，最后一次出水时已是第二天的黎明，双手被泡得高高肿起，潜水衣的袖子上染上了手腕的血渍。
    为了供应武汉市人民生活的需要，广东、广西、湖南、四川等地运来了大批大米，只八月份一个月运来的就足够全市人民吃一个半月。从焦作运来了五千多吨白煤。从上海、广州、汕头、太原运来了各种各样的蔬菜和副食品，每天运进菜类共八、九十万斤。武汉人民经历过一九三一年水灾悲惨的生活；那一年的水灾中，无食无住的饥民有二十三万多人，死亡三万二千多人。正如一位老居民所说的：“那时物价比水涨得还快得多！”而且出高价还买不到东西。现在物价平稳，物资充足。在洪水包围中，人们吃到了轮船运来的雪里红，直达快车运来的鸡蛋。而在远方的城市里，还有人殷切地询问：“我们有土豆、干鱼，你们要不要？”
    武汉人民现在正在庆贺他们防汛斗争的辉煌胜利，在检查战绩，总结经验时，人们都把党的领导、全国人民的支援放在胜利的原因的最前面。武汉人民将永远不会忘记在那些紧张和艰难的日子里所得到的全国人民的无微不至的关怀和巨大的援助。
