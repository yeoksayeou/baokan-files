    Shandong Province's Huimin Special District has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton this year, with both yield per unit area and total output exceeding the highest levels in local history. The entire special district's 2,340,000 mu of cotton fields yielded an average of over 44 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of over 7 jin compared to 1952. Bin County's 384,000 mu of cotton fields yielded 55.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu, double that of 1949. The entire special district can produce 25 million jin more ginned cotton than last year.
    Currently, cotton farmers have already harvested 30 jin of "first flush" seed cotton per mu of cotton field, and the "middle flush" flowers are blooming in large quantities. Groups of women are working hard to pick them. Cotton farmers sell large quantities of new cotton to the state every day. Recently, the daily amount of seed cotton collected by over 500 collection stations and over 100 cotton collection teams in the district has reached over 2 million jin. Over 600 power-driven cotton ginning machines and 1,700 animal-powered and manual cotton ginning machines are working overtime to rush-gin ginned cotton. Large numbers of trucks loaded with cotton have been transported along the roads.

    山东省惠民专区二百多万亩棉花空前丰收
    今年山东省惠民专区的棉花空前丰收，单位面积产量和总产量都超过了当地历史上最高水平。全专区的二百三十四万亩棉花，平均每亩可产皮棉四十四斤多，比一九五二年增产七斤多。滨县的三十八万四千亩棉花，每亩可产皮棉五十五斤半，为一九四九年的两倍。全专区可比去年多产皮棉两千五百万斤。
    目前，种棉农民已在每亩棉田上收了三十斤“头喷”籽棉，“中喷”花又大量吐絮，成群结队的妇女正在紧张收摘。种棉农民每天都有大量新棉卖给国家，最近全区五百多处收购站和一百多个收棉组每日收籽棉数量已达二百多万斤。六百多台动力轧花车和一千七百台畜力、人力轧花车正在加紧赶轧皮棉。大批满载着棉花的汽车已沿着条条公路外运。　（新华社）
