    The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions convened the Beijing Municipal Advanced Workers' Family Representatives Conference on October 19th. At the meeting, Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report on the work of the fourth quarter. Comrade Yang Zhihua, Deputy Minister of the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, addressed the meeting. At the meeting, nine advanced family groups and fifty-seven family models in the city were awarded.
    At the meeting, experiences in family work were exchanged. A female worker committee member of a factory trade union introduced the experience of the first team of the sixth district of the family committee of the factory in playing the role of activists in doing a good job in family work. Chi Wencao, a family member of the Shijingshan Power Plant, vividly introduced her work experience: because she rationally arranged her time, she not only did a good job in social work, but also did her housework in an orderly manner; she did a very good job in taking care of her husband, educating her children, and hygiene.
    These experiences greatly inspired the more than two hundred advanced workers' family representatives and female workers' family work cadres who attended the meeting. Everyone expressed that they would go back to learn from these experiences and improve their work.
    In their speeches, the representatives all expressed their support for the call of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to launch inter-factory labor competitions throughout the city. The representatives unanimously passed a resolution to respond to the call of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to launch inter-factory labor competitions throughout the city. The representatives unanimously expressed that they would ensure that the families of workers in state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines throughout the city are united, learn advanced work experience, cooperate with the development of inter-factory competitions, and do the following tasks well: 1. Protect the safe production of factories and mines and care for public property.
    2. Strengthen unity and mutual assistance, further improve family work, and encourage workers to attend work. 3. Do a good job in housework, ensure that workers eat well, sleep well, and work at ease, and establish model families.
    4. Conscientiously do a good job in sanitation and prevent diseases, so that workers are healthy and participate in inter-factory labor competitions with more energy.
