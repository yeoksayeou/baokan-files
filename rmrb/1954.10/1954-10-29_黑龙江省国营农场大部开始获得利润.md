The state-owned mechanized grain farms in Heilongjiang Province have shown unprecedented new vitality this year, beginning to reverse the situation of low yields, high costs, and high waste that has persisted for seven years. Preliminary calculations show that this year a total profit of over 26 billion yuan was made, and more than 59,000 tons of wheat and soybeans were handed over to the state.

Of the province's twenty-two state-owned farms, excluding the newly built Sandaogang and Yihe farms, the remaining twenty farms cultivated more than 69,000 hectares of land. The yield of most crops exceeded that of local farmers. Among them, the thirteen farms under the province cultivated nearly 13,000 hectares of wheat, with an average yield of 1,307 kilograms per hectare. The six farms under the Ministry of Agriculture cultivated more than 24,000 hectares of wheat, with an average yield of 1,200 kilograms per hectare. The Shuguang and Jixian farms cultivated 5,300 hectares of wheat, with an average yield of more than 1,520 kilograms per hectare, more than double the yield of last year.

Costs have generally been reduced compared to the past. At the "93" Farm, the cost per hectare used to be around 2 million yuan, but this year it has been reduced to 1.6 million yuan. At the Shuguang Farm, the cost of wheat per kilogram last year was 2,500 yuan. This year, due to increased yields, the cost per kilogram has been reduced to 980 yuan.

In the past, some farms made profits in agriculture, but lost money in animal husbandry, forestry, and other areas, and could never develop in a balanced way. This year, of the fourteen farms under the province that have been put into production, six farms have seen a new situation of favorable development in all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production.

Eighty-five percent of the twenty mechanized farms put into production have made profits. The "93" Farm made a profit of more than 6 billion yuan, and the Shuguang Farm made a profit of 4.2 billion yuan from wheat alone.

The improvement in the situation of state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province is mainly due to the continuous study of the Soviet Union's experience in operating socialist agricultural enterprises. With the direct assistance of Soviet experts, the farms have basically established a management order for socialist agricultural enterprises. Since 1953, the farms have generally implemented financial management and technical management, strengthened production planning, and reversed the past situation of being clueless and blindly producing.

    黑龙江省国营农场大部开始获得利润
    黑龙江省国营机械谷物农场，今年出现了前所未有的新气象，开始扭转了七年来产量低，成本高，浪费大的局面。初步计算，今年共获利润二百六十余亿元，上交给国家的小麦、大豆达五万九千多吨。
    全省二十二个国营农场，除三道岗、义和两个新建场外，其余二十个场共播种了六万九千多公顷土地，大部分作物超过了当地农民的产量，其中省属的十三个场近一万三千公顷小麦，平均每公顷产量一千三百零七公斤。农业部所属六场两万四千多公顷小麦，平均每公顷产量一千二百公斤。曙光、集贤两场五千三百公顷小麦，平均每公顷在一千五百二十公斤以上，超过去年产量一倍还多。
    在成本方面普遍都比过去降低了，“九三”农场过去一公顷地的成本都在二百万元上下，今年降低到一百六十万元。曙光农场去年小麦的公斤成本是两千五百元，今年由于提高了产量，每公斤成本已经降低到九百八十元。
    过去农场有的在农业上获利了，但畜牧、林业等其他方面又赔钱，总是不能均衡地发展。今年只是省属投入生产的十四个农场中，就有六个农场出现了农、林、牧以及副业生产等各方面有利的新局面。
    二十个投入生产的机械农场里，百分之八十五的农场均获得了利润，“九三”农场获利在六十亿元以上，曙光农场仅小麦一项获利即达四十二亿元。
    黑龙江省国营农场局面的好转，主要由于不断学习苏联经营社会主义农业企业的经验，在苏联专家的直接帮助下，各场已基本上建立起了社会主义农业企业的管理秩序，从一九五三年起，各场普遍实行了财务管理和技术管理，加强了生产上的计划性，扭转了过去那种心中无数，生产盲目的情况。
