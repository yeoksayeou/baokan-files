Xinhua News Agency, October 17th:

    Academician of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Member of Parliament, and Stalin International Peace Prize Winner, Major General Sahib Sokee, who is visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, met with a reporter from Ta Kung Pao on October 14, 1954. The following are Major General Sokee's answers to the questions raised by the reporter:
    (1) Question: Several Asian countries participated in the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty Organization" signed in Manila last month, but India, Burma, Ceylon, and Indonesia did not participate. As a peace fighter, would you like to comment on the consequences this treaty will have on Asian security and world peace?
    Answer: This "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty Organization" is the product of countries with imperialist ideas, such as the United States, Britain, and France, who have not yet realized that the era of colonialism and exploitation of backward countries by various means is long gone. The people of Asia are now awakened and have noticed that they must become masters of their own destiny and that they can and will rapidly improve their living standards and cultural levels. They are no longer willing to be exploited for the benefit of foreigners. This is clearly illustrated by the fact that the most important Southeast Asian countries did not participate in the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty Organization." On the contrary, the People's Republic of China, India, and Burma signed a convention with five principles, guaranteeing mutual respect for sovereignty, peaceful coexistence, non-interference, and guaranteeing trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. This convention and similar conventions signed between other countries in the region will guarantee peace and prosperity in the region.
    What was done in Manila was intended to safeguard the colonial rights of European countries and the United States, and not to maintain peace in the region. The treaty violates the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter and is therefore illegal. The treaty is intended to maintain tension and to prevent the development of a consolidated and lasting peace in the world. I believe that as long as the people of Asia faithfully adhere to the spirit of the five principles in the conventions they have concluded, and as long as they are unwilling to sell themselves out for personal gain, the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty Organization" will absolutely not be able to deprive them of their freedom. In the new world, colonial wars like those in Korea and Indochina have no hope of victory, as has been proven. Therefore, I believe that as long as we remain vigilant and do not allow ourselves to fall into the traps of the US government and its satellite countries to undermine peace, then the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" is just a piece of paper.
    (2) Question: What are your opinions on the constitution recently passed by the National People's Congress of New China?
    Answer: I am very happy that this constitution can be understood without consulting senior lawyers. This constitution is made for the people, and its main purpose is to enable the people to strive to create a better life and a high level of culture for themselves. The formulation of this constitution will make these possible. I think it is particularly important that this constitution not only states the rights of citizens but also their obligations. In addition, it also guarantees these rights of citizens.
    (3) Question: What are your opinions on the joint statement recently issued by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union?
    Answer: I think the recent Sino-Soviet joint declaration is of great value. It shows that the mutual relations between socialist countries are built on the basis of friendship and cooperation. But I personally attach particular importance to the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement. This is the first time in human history that two countries have shared the fruits of their scientific and technological knowledge without any reservations. It is worth noting that the two countries that concluded this agreement are at very different stages of development.
    If we know that two enterprises in the same capitalist country not only cannot share their scientific knowledge, but also use a large set of trademark law regulations to maintain their own patents, then we can understand the importance of this agreement. Under such circumstances, it is completely unimaginable for two countries to share their technical knowledge. Therefore, this agreement between China and the Soviet Union creates conditions that enable the development of science and technology to reach the highest level. Scientific and technological knowledge is the result of the joint efforts of all mankind, and it can only be fully developed if secrets are not kept from each other. This agreement between China and the Soviet Union shows that the socialist economy has reason to fully play its role in human affairs. This agreement shows how rationally and appropriately the world will develop science and technology.
    (4) Question: You have been here for several days. What are your initial impressions of New China?
    Answer: My most vivid impression is that the Chinese are a very lovable and hospitable people. They work tirelessly to make their guests feel comfortable and provide them with many conveniences so that they can know everything they want to know. It is precisely with this state of mind that, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, they are wholeheartedly and happily working to build a rich and cultural life for themselves. In the short five years, including the recovery period and the two years of the Five-Year Plan, they have done amazing work. I have seen the figures released by Premier Zhou Enlai regarding the various achievements since 1949. They are very impressive and provide prospects for even greater achievements. Their enthusiasm for building productive resources wholeheartedly, coupled with the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement, will perform miracles. I know that the Soviet Union is already helping China build one hundred and forty-one basic enterprises. And with the generosity and selflessness characteristic of socialism, the Soviet Union will now add fifteen more industrial enterprises. China's development will become a beacon for all countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. I fully believe that those so-called backward countries will learn from the great achievements of the Chinese people how to throw off their poverty and suffering.
    China's great construction work is also a guarantee of world peace. The Soviet Union and China, together with India and the goodwill and active cooperation of other Asian countries, will become a fortress of world peace.
    (5) Question: The Soviet Union has once again proposed at the United Nations General Assembly to sign an international treaty on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. Although the Soviet Union has repeatedly made such proposals, an agreement to ban weapons of mass destruction has not yet been reached. In your opinion, what is the main obstacle to reaching such an agreement?
    Answer: The reason why an agreement on atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction has not yet been reached is very simple: the United States is unwilling to have such an agreement and only wants to possess all atomic weapons. In the past, when the United States thought it was the sole possessor of the atomic bomb, it wanted to use the atomic bomb as a political weapon. It is true that the people of the United States and the people of other countries were frightened by the existence of this weapon. But they were intoxicated by the belief that if anything destructive happened, only the "evil Russians" would suffer. They thought they were safe. But the invention of the hydrogen bomb and the recent hydrogen bomb explosion experiment in the Marshall Islands have convinced people that no one is safe - no country, no people. Now the people of the world are demanding a ban on atomic weapons. They have begun to realize that the Baruch Plan, which the United States has proposed in the past as a solution, is merely a means of possessing and controlling atomic weapons. A different spirit is now emerging. I personally believe that soon the United Nations will come up with a reasonable solution to this extremely dangerous situation. When the United Nations recognizes the reason for this problem, the control of all weapons of mass destruction and disarmament will be sincerely implemented, which will be beneficial to all mankind.

    印度科学院院士、国会议员、斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人
    索克少将就东南亚侵略集团等问题答记者问
    【新华社十七日讯】应中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国科学院邀请来我国访问的印度科学院院士、国会议员、斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人萨希布·索克少将一九五四年十月十四日接见大公报记者。下面是索克少将对记者所提出的问题的答复：（一）问：有几个亚洲国家上个月参加了在马尼拉签订的“东南亚防务条约组织”，但是印度、缅甸、锡兰和印度尼西亚并没有参加。您是否愿意以一个和平战士的身份，就这个条约对亚洲安全与世界和平会产生什么后果发表一些意见？
    答：这个“东南亚防务条约组织”是那些有帝国主义思想的国家的产物，这些国家，如美国、英国及法国，还没有认识到殖民主义及用各种方法对落后国家进行剥削的时代早已是一去不复返了。亚洲人民现在已经醒悟起来了，他们已经注意到这个问题：他们必须成为自己的命运的主人，他们能够而且即将迅速地提高自己的生活水平与文化水平。他们再也不愿为了外国的利益而受到剥削。这点是已经由下面这个事实清楚地说明了：最重要的东南亚国家都没有参加“东南亚防务条约组织”，相反地，中华人民共和国、印度和缅甸却签订了有五项原则的公约，保证互相尊重主权、和平共处、互不干涉、及保证在平等互利的基础上进行贸易。这个公约和本地区其他各国人民之间所签订的类似的公约，将保障本地区的和平与繁荣。
    在马尼拉所做出的事情，其用意是在维护欧洲国家和美国的殖民权利，而决不是在维护这个地区的和平。这个条约是违反联合国宪章的文字和精神的，因此它是不合法的。条约的用意在于保持紧张局势，在于不让世界巩固的、持久的和平得到发展。我认为，只要亚洲人民忠实遵守他们订立的公约中五项原则的精神，只要他们不愿意为了个人的小利而出卖自己，那么这个“东南亚防务条约组织”绝对不能剥夺他们的自由。在新生的世界里，像朝鲜及印度支那那样的殖民战争决无胜利的希望，这是已经证明了的。所以我认为只要我们保持警惕，不让自己陷入美国政府及其仆从国家破坏和平的诡计中去，那么“东南亚防务条约”就是一纸空文。（二）问：您对于新中国全国人民代表大会最近通过的宪法意见如何？
    答：我很高兴这部宪法可以不请教高等律师就能看懂。这部宪法是为人民制定的，它的主要目的是要使人民能为自己努力创造美好的生活和高度文化的水平。这部宪法的制定将使这些成为可能。我认为特别重要的是这部宪法不仅写明了公民的权利，同时也写明了他们的义务。此外，它还保证了公民的这些权利。
  （三）问：您对于中华人民共和国和苏联最近发表的联合声明有何意见？
    答：我认为最近发表的中苏联合宣言有很大的价值。它说明了社会主义国家的互相关系是建筑在友谊与合作的基础上的。但是我个人特别重视中苏科学技术合作协定。这是在人类历史上第一次有两个国家完全没有保留地共同享受它们的科学技术知识的成果。值得注意的是，订立这个协定的两个国家所处的发展的阶段是极不相同的。
    如果我们知道同在一个资本主义国家里的两个企业不但不能共享它们的科学知识，反而用一大套商标法的规定来保持自己的专利，那么，我们就可以明白这个协定的重要性了。在这样的情况下，两个国家共享它们的技术知识是完全不可想像的。因此中苏两国的这个协定创造了一种条件，使科学与技术的发展能够达到最高的水平。科学技术知识是全人类共同努力的成果，只有互相不保守秘密，它才可以充分发展。中苏两国的这个协定表明，社会主义经济在人类事务中是有理由来充分发挥它的作用的。这个协定说明，世界将会多么合理而恰当地来发展科学与技术。（四）问：你来此地已经有几天了，请问对新中国的初步观感如何？
    答：我的最生动的印象就是：中国人是十分可爱与好客的人民。他们不辞劳苦地使他们的客人感到舒服，并且予他们许多方便，使他们能够知道他们希望知道的一切事情。他们亦正是怀着这种心情，在毛泽东主席的英明领导下全心全意地愉快地工作着，为他们自己建立起一个丰富的与文化的生活。在短短的五年，其中包括恢复时期和五年计划的两年中，他们已经做了惊人的工作。我已经看见周恩来总理所发表的关于一九四九年以来种种成就的数字。它们给人非常深刻的印象，并且提供了获得更大的成就的远景。他们全心全意地建设生产资源的热诚，配合了中苏科学技术合作协定，将会演出奇迹。我知道苏联已经在帮助中国建设一百四十一个基本企业。而本着社会主义特有的慷慨无私，现在苏联又将增添十五项工业企业。中国的发展将会变成亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲所有国家的灯塔。我完全相信，那些所谓落后的国家将从中国人民的伟大成就那里，学习到如何抛弃他们的穷困与痛苦。
    中国的伟大的建设工作也就是世界和平的保障。苏联和中国在一起，现在还有印度以及亚洲其他国家的善意与积极合作，将变成世界和平的堡垒。（五）问：苏联又一次在联合国大会上提议签订裁减军备及禁止大规模毁灭性武器的国际条约。虽然苏联一再提出这样的建议，但是迄今还不曾达成禁止大规模毁灭性武器的协议。据你看达成这样一个协议的主要障碍是什么？
    答：关于原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的协议迄今尚未达成，理由很简单，就是美国不愿意有这样的一个协议，而只想占有一切原子武器。从前，当美国以为自己是原子弹唯一的占有者的时候，它想把原子弹用来作一项政治武器。美国本国的人民以及其他国家的人民由于看到这种武器的存在而感到惶惶不安，这是确确实实的事情。但是他们被这种信念所陶醉了：如果有任何毁灭性的事情发生，受害的只会是“邪恶的俄国人”。他们以为他们很平安。但是氢弹的发明及最近马绍尔群岛氢弹爆炸的实验已经使人民相信，谁也不是平安无事的——任何国家、任何人民都是如此。现在全世界的人民都要求禁止原子武器。他们已经开始认识到，美国过去提出以巴鲁区计划作为一种解决的方法只不过是一种占有并控制原子武器的手段而已。现在一种不同的精神正在出现。我个人认为，不久，联合国将会拟出一个合理的方案来解决这种极端危险的情况。当联合国认识到这个问题的理由时，一切大规模毁灭性武器的管制以及裁减军备都将被诚意地实行，这将是有利于整个人类的。
