In Bosang Village, Kangding County, Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, there is a mutual aid team for exchanging labor. The team consists of two Tibetan and two Han households. They voluntarily organized themselves last August when the People's Government called on farmers to carry out mutual aid for exchanging labor.

The team leader, Daiwa Rangbu, is an agricultural labor model. This April, just after the team finished spring plowing and sowing, the People's Government invited him to Beijing to attend the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations.

On the evening before Daiwa Rangbu left for Beijing, the team held a meeting. At the meeting, the members said enviously: Daiwa Rangbu, Beijing is the capital of our motherland, our beloved Chairman Mao lives there, you will definitely see him when you go to the celebration, this is your greatest glory and happiness! Everyone also expressed their determination: We must help each other well in production at home and strive to become labor models ourselves and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao.

Last year, the four member households only hoed the weeds once and applied base fertilizer once. This year, everyone's land in the team has been hoed twice and top dressing has been applied once. Everyone is as close and loving as a family in production. When a member lacks manpower or draft animals, the other households enthusiastically help.

When Daiwa Rangbu went to Beijing, he left in a hurry. All the land had just been sown, and his wife, Lazhu, was the only labor force at home. The Han team members automatically helped Lazhu prepare the land, and they also helped her build earthen walls around several pieces of land near the road that were often traversed by cattle and horses. Lazhu didn't know how to plow, so when she needed to plow the fallow land, these two households helped her.

The Tibetan farmer Yangjia Axi has more land, but there are only two laborers in his family. On the day his family was weeding, Lazhu and the other two team members came early in the morning to help. Everyone said they wouldn't let a single weed remain and would hoe the weeds in his field as if they were hoeing weeds in their own field. In one day, they cleaned up all the weeds in his field. Yao Zenghui, a 59-year-old Han team member, is a new land reclamation household. The People's Government allocated him twelve "ke" (one ke equals 1.8 mu) of land based on the needs of his family size two years ago. By the spring plowing this year, only eight ke of land had been cultivated and sown. When Yangjia Axi saw this situation, he thought that his family's situation was better than Yao Zenghui's and that he should help him. In June, Yangjia Axi selected four ke of good land from his own fallow land, where barley had been planted last year, and gave it to Yao Zenghui. Later, he also brought his own cattle and plowed this four ke of land himself. The farmers near and far in Bosang Village are very envious of the mutual assistance and friendship of the exchange labor team.

In September, the harvest of crops has generally begun on the plateau. This year, the team's average barley yield per ke of land is two ke (equivalent to 70 jin) more than last year. The wheat stalks in Daiwa Rangbu's wheat field are shoulder-high, and the ears of wheat are heavy and drooping. According to preliminary estimates by the agricultural technology promotion station, each mu can yield more than 600 jin. The village will elect labor models after the autumn harvest. The exchange labor team held a meeting to ensure no grain is lost during the autumn harvest, to select good seeds, and to plow the autumn land well, in order to prepare for next year's production.

    一个藏、汉族的换工互助组
    新华社记者　杨昌明、平西泽仁
    西康省藏族自治区康定县柏桑村有个换工互助组，换工组有两户藏族组员和两户汉族组员，他们是去年八月间人民政府号召农民开展换工互助时自愿组织起来的。
    换工组组长戴瓦让布是一个农业劳动模范。今年四月，换工组春耕播种刚结束，人民政府便邀请他去北京参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼。
    戴瓦让布动身去北京的头一天晚上，换工组开了一个会。会上，组员们羡慕地说：戴瓦让布，北京是祖国的首都，我们敬爱的毛主席住在那里，你去观礼一定会看到他的，这是你最大的光荣和幸福！大家还表示决心说：我们在家里一定要很好的互助生产，也争取当上劳动模范，去北京见毛主席。
    去年，四户组员都只锄过一次草，上过一次底肥，今年全组每个组员的地都锄了两遍草，还上了一次追肥，大家在生产中如同一家人样的亲密友爱，遇有组员缺少人力或耕畜时，另外的几户组员都热情地去帮助。
    戴瓦让布去北京时，走得很匆忙，所有的地才下完种，而家里只有他妻子拉珠一个劳动力，汉族组员就自动去帮助拉珠整地，还帮她把几块经常有牛马走过、靠近路边的地砌起土围墙。拉珠不会操犁耕地，她要耕轮歇地时，这两户组员就去帮助。
    藏民杨加阿西家的地比较多些，但家里也只有两个劳动力，他家锄草的那天，拉珠和另外两户组员一大早就赶来帮助，大家都表示不让一根杂草留下，要像在自己地里锄草一样，一天时间就把他家地里的杂草锄得干干净净。五十九岁的汉族组员姚增辉是一个新开荒户，前年人民政府根据他一家大小生活的需要，给他调剂了十二克（一克合一亩八分）地，到今年春耕时，只开出八克地下种，杨加阿西看见这种情形，心想自己要比姚增辉家情况好些，应该帮助他。六月间杨加阿西便从自己的轮歇地中选出了去年种青稞的四克好地送给姚增辉，以后，他还牵来自己的耕牛，亲自把这四克地耕了一遍。柏桑村远近的农民看到换工组这样互助友爱的情形，都很羡慕。
    九月，高原上已普遍开始收割庄稼。全组今年青稞平均每克地比去年多收两克（合七十斤）。戴瓦让布的小麦地，麦秆高齐肩头，麦穗沉甸甸下垂，据农业技术推广站的初步预测，每亩可打六百多斤。村里秋收后就要选举劳动模范，换工组开了一个会，要在秋收中不抛失粮食，选好种，犁好秋地，为明年生产作好准备。
