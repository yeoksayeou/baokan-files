    Guangzhou Xicun Cement Plant's Kiln No. 3 Sets New Safety Record
    As of October 20th, the No. 3 rotary kiln at the state-owned Xicun Cement Plant in Guangzhou has been operating safely for 321 days, setting a new national safety record.
    In the past five years, the No. 3 rotary kiln at the Xicun Cement Plant has set the national safety record four times in a row, receiving commendations from the Ministry of Heavy Industry. During this 321-day period of safe operation, workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and teamwork, conscientiously performing maintenance on mechanical equipment, and overcoming dozens of mechanical and firing malfunctions, both large and small. During the safe operation period, the savings from avoiding two overhauls and the increased output gained by saving time have resulted in increased production and savings for the state worth 700 million yuan.
    Now, the employees have proposed a new goal of ensuring 350 days of safe operation and striving for a full year of safe operation.

    广州西村水泥厂三号窑创安全运转新纪录
    广州市国营西村水泥厂第三号回转窑到十月二十日止，已安全运转三百二十一天，创造了全国安全运转的新纪录。
    西村水泥厂第三号回转窑在过去五年中曾连续四次创造安全运转的全国最高纪录。受到重工业部通报表扬。在这一次安全运转的三百二十一天中，工人们发挥了高度积极性和集体协作的精神，认真做好机械设备维护保养工作，先后克服大小数十次的机械故障和煆故障。安全运转期间，光是由于节省两次中修的费用和争取时间增加的产量，就为国家增产节约了七亿元。
    现在，职工们又提出了保证安全运转三百五十天、争取安全运转一年的努力目标。
