    Zhejiang Province is actively planning for winter water conservancy projects. Most of the more than two hundred small reservoirs planned for construction in the Jinhua Special District have completed surveying and design work. The Quzhou Special District plans to build fifteen reservoirs and four larger flood control projects in the first batch, of which nine have completed surveying and measurement. The Hang(zhou) Jia(xing) Hu(zhou) plain water network area, which suffered severe waterlogging disasters this year, plans to vigorously repair dikes and dredge rivers and canals during the winter repairs to enhance its ability to defend against waterlogging. The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has also sent two survey teams to the Hangjiahu area to conduct a two-month survey to prepare for the fundamental treatment of local waterlogging disasters. In addition, many areas have also begun training water conservancy technicians and preparing materials. It is expected that some projects will begin construction in October.
    The various water conservancy projects planned for winter repairs in Zhejiang Province this year will increase by more than double compared to last year. Most of these are various medium and small-sized farmland water conservancy projects run by the masses themselves, and the state will provide loans or investment assistance for a small number of larger projects. After the completion of all the projects, the benefited farmland can reach 4 million mu, which can increase grain production by approximately 139 million jin.

    浙江省筹划水利冬修工程
    浙江省正积极筹划水利冬修工程。金华专区计划兴修的二百多个小型水库，大部分已完成勘查、设计工作。衢州专区准备第一批兴建十五个水库和四处较大的防洪工程，已有九处完成勘查和测量。今年遭受严重内涝灾害的杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）平原水网地区，准备在冬修中大力培修圩堤，疏浚河渠，以增强防御内涝的能力。浙江省水利局并派出两个勘察队到杭嘉湖地区，进行为期两个月的勘查工作，为根治当地水涝灾害作准备。此外，不少地区还开始进行了水利技术人员的训练和物资准备工作。预计部分工程在十月间就可开始动工。
    浙江省今年计划冬修的各项水利工程约比去年增加一倍多。其中大部分是群众自办的各种中、小型农田水利工程，小部分较大的工程国家将发放贷款或投资扶助。全部工程完工后，受益农田可达四百万亩，约可增产粮食一亿三千九百万斤。
