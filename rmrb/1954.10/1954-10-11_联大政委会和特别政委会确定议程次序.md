Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 10th: The Political Committee and the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began their work on the 8th.

At the meetings held by these two committees, the vice-chairmen and rapporteurs of the committees were elected.

The Political Committee decided on the following order for the discussion of items on its agenda:

One, the question of regulating, limiting, and balanced reduction of all armed forces and armaments – Report of the United Nations Disarmament Commission.

Two, the proposal by the Soviet delegation regarding the conclusion of an international convention on the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

Three, methods to maintain and strengthen international peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter – Report of the Collective Measures Committee.

Four, the recommendation of the United States delegation regarding international cooperation in the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Five, the West Irian issue.

Six, the Korean question – Report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea.

Seven, the Tunisian question.

Eight, the Moroccan question.

Nine, the question of applying the principle of the right of self-government and self-determination of the people of the island of Cyprus under the general guidance of the United Nations.

When deciding the order, Soviet representative Vyshinsky suggested moving the issue raised by the United States, "International Cooperation in the Development of the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy," from item four to item three as a more important issue. However, U.S. representative Lodge opposed this suggestion by the Soviet representative, arguing that the issue "requires a period of preparation and study." Vyshinsky pointed out that important issues should be discussed first, and that the Soviet delegation believed that the United States had already prepared for the issue it had raised. Therefore, it was difficult to understand why the U.S. representative and representatives of certain other countries were opposed to his suggestion. Vyshinsky stated that he would not insist on his suggestion. Thus, this item remained as agenda item four.

The Special Political Committee determined the order of discussion of items on its agenda, deciding to list the Burmese accusation of aggression by the Kuomintang Group as the first item, the question of the treatment of people of Indian origin in the Union of South Africa as the second item, and the question of the admission of new member states as the third item.

    联大政委会和特别政委会确定议程次序
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会和特别政治委员会已在八日开始工作。
    在这两个委员会举行的会议上，选出了委员会的副主席和报告员。
    政治委员会决定它的议程上各项议案的讨论次序如下：
    一、规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切军队及军备问题——联合国裁军委员会报告书。
    二、苏联代表团所提出的关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约的提案。
    三、按照联合国宪章的宗旨和原则用以维持和加强国际和平与安全的方法——集体措施委员会报告书。
    四、美国代表团提出的关于在发展原子能和平用途方面的国际合作的建议。
    五、西伊里安问题。
    六、朝鲜问题——联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会报告书。
    七、突尼斯问题。
    八、摩洛哥问题。
    九、在联合国总的指导下对塞浦路斯岛居民应用人民自治权和自决权的原则的问题。
    在决定次序的时候，苏联代表维辛斯基建议把美国提出的“在发展原子能和平用途方面的国际合作”这一问题作为较重要的问题从议程第四项移到第三项。但是，美国代表洛奇反对苏联代表这一建议，他认为这个问题的“准备和研究工作需要一段时间”。维辛斯基指出：重要的问题应当先讨论，而且苏联代表团以为，美国对自己提出的问题早已准备好了，因此，很难理解为什么美国代表和其他某些国家的代表要反对他的建议。维辛斯基表示不坚持自己的建议。于是，这一项问题仍然留作议程第四项。
    特别政治委员会确定了它的议程上各项议案的讨论次序，决定把缅甸控诉国民党集团侵略案列为第一项，第二项是南非联邦境内印度人待遇问题，第三项是接纳新会员国问题。
