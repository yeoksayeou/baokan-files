    The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China issued instructions on persisting in education work in disaster areas.
    The instructions pointed out that the current guiding principle for education work in disaster areas is to closely integrate with production and disaster relief work, adopt various methods according to specific circumstances, actively persist in teaching, and gradually restore schools in a planned way. All ideas and practices that are detached from the reality of disaster areas and carry out teaching in isolation, or excessively emphasize difficulties, and can persist but do not actively persist are wrong and must be prevented and overcome.
    The instructions believe that strengthening the political and ideological education of education work cadres, teachers, and students in disaster areas is one of the important conditions for persisting in education in disaster areas. It is necessary to make all education workers in disaster areas deeply aware of the great significance of actively persisting in and restoring education in disaster areas to the country's entire education construction and socialist construction, and establish confidence in sharing weal and woe with the masses and persisting in education in disaster areas. It is necessary to strengthen political and ideological education and collectivism education related to production and disaster relief for students in disaster areas, and inspire them to study hard and actively participate in production and disaster relief labor. Among teachers and students, it is necessary to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and love and jointly persist in education in disaster areas. The instructions require education administrative departments in disaster areas to do everything possible to maintain schools in disaster areas, and should properly resettle teachers and students on the principle of relying on the masses to produce and help themselves, striving to economize, and rationally using financial and material resources, and gradually repair school buildings in a planned manner. The organizational structure of secondary schools and above in disaster areas should, in principle, be maintained. Teachers in schools in disaster areas should be preserved by all means. The families of teachers affected by the disaster should enjoy the same relief as ordinary disaster victims. In addition to the overall social relief, middle school students affected by the disaster can also be adjusted and resolved appropriately from the total amount of student aid funds in the province between disaster areas and non-disaster areas. The instructions pointed out that persisting in education in disaster areas must make the form of learning organization adapt to the situation in disaster areas, so that learning and production and disaster relief work are effectively combined. Secondary schools, urban primary schools, and other schools that can start school as soon as possible should strive to start school as soon as possible and strive to maintain normal teaching. In particular, for graduating classes of senior high schools and junior high schools, we must do our best to ensure that their teaching is not affected. Schools in areas where it is still difficult to maintain normal teaching for the time being can adopt various appropriate methods to persist in teaching according to the specific circumstances. Focus on learning the main courses and appropriately streamline the teaching content. School cadres and teachers in disaster areas must gradually restore schools with a completely positive attitude, and gradually restore normal teaching from various alternative forms of teaching.

    中华人民共和国教育部发出关于坚持灾区教育工作的指示。
    指示指出，当前灾区教育工作的方针是：紧紧地结合生产救灾工作，根据具体情况，采取各种方式，积极坚持教学，并逐步地有计划地恢复学校。一切脱离灾区实际孤立地进行教学，或者过分强调困难，能坚持而不积极坚持的想法和做法都是错误的，必须加以防止和克服。
    指示认为，加强对灾区的教育工作干部、教师和学生的政治思想教育，是坚持灾区教育的重要条件之一。必须使全体灾区教育工作者深刻认识积极坚持和恢复灾区教育，对国家的整个教育建设和社会主义建设的重要意义，树立与群众同甘苦、共患难，坚持灾区教育的信心；必须对灾区学生加强有关生产救灾的政治思想教育和集体主义教育，启发他们艰苦学习和积极参加生产救灾劳动。在教师学生之间，要发扬互助友爱精神，共同坚持灾区教育。指示要求灾区教育行政部门，必须尽一切可能维持灾区学校，应在依靠群众生产自救、力求节约、合理使用财力和物力的原则下，妥善地安置教师和学生，并有计划地逐步修缮校舍。灾区中等学校以上学校的建制，原则上应予保持。灾区学校的教师应予设法保存。受灾教师的家属，应和一般灾民享受同样救济。受灾的中学学生，除了整个社会救济外，还可在全省助学金的总数额内，从灾区和非灾区之间酌予调剂解决。指示指出，坚持灾区教育，必须使学习组织的形式适应灾区情况，做到学习与生产救灾工作有效地结合。中等学校、城镇小学和其他能够早日开学的学校应争取早日开学，力求维持正常教学。特别是对高中和初中应届毕业班，要尽最大力量使他们教学不受影响。维持正常教学暂时还有困难的地区的学校，可根据具体情况，采取各种适宜的方式坚持教学。集中学习主要课程，适当精简教学内容。灾区的学校干部和教师必须以完全积极的态度，逐步恢复学校，并由各种变通形式的教学逐步恢复正常教学。　（新华社）
