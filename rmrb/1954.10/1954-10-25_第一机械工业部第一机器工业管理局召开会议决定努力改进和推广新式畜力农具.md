The First Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry Convened a Meeting
Decided to Strive to Improve and Promote New Animal-Powered Farm Implements
    The First Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry convened a national farm implement manufacturing conference from October 9th to 19th. The conference studied and discussed the national farm implement production tasks for 1955, as well as issues related to farm implement manufacturing in the future.
    The meeting first pointed out that due to the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement across the country, by August of this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide had grown to more than 100,000. According to local plans, by the spring plowing season of 1955, the number of agricultural production cooperatives will increase to more than 500,000. Therefore, manufacturing and promoting new farm implements in 1955 will be a very heavy task. Based on actual needs, the meeting formulated a farm implement production plan for the future (from November this year to the end of next year): eight types of animal-powered farm implements, totaling 700,000 units, of which double-wheel double-铧 plows and double-wheel single-铧 plows account for more than 500,000 units. In addition, there are cultivators, harvesters, spike-tooth harrows, disc harrows, seeders, and threshers.
    The meeting also conducted special studies and discussions on issues such as improving the quality of farm implements, reducing costs, production collaboration, and supply and marketing. In the past, the general feedback from farmers in the promotion of new farm implements was "too many styles," "specifications and standards are not uniform," "it is difficult to配零件 when parts are broken," and "cannot afford them," etc. The First Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry had conducted research on the above issues before the meeting. It also organized engineers and relevant personnel to standardize the drawings of five types of farm implements, such as double-wheel double-铧 plows, double-wheel single-铧 plows, cultivators, ten-row seeders, and twelve-row seeders (the double-wheel double-铧 plow was successfully trial-produced by the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory after standardization, and the test proved that the results were good). At the meeting, Li Kezuo, chief engineer of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, reported on the factory's manufacturing process of the double-wheel double-铧 plow, and Chen Youjun, engineer of the Technology Department of the First Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, reported on the trial production and technical inspection of new products. The meeting also resolved the unified supply of certain standard parts such as plowshares, screws, and plow moldboards. For example, screws are uniformly supplied by the Shenyang Screw Factory, and plowshares are uniformly supplied by the Northeast Lingshan Farm Implement Factory, in order to ensure quality and achieve the purpose of interchangeable parts. The meeting also studied the agreement to be signed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives on the manufacturing, promotion, and supply of double-wheel double-铧 plows and double-wheel single-铧 plows in 1955.
    This meeting made the cadres present realize that under the current circumstances in our country where tractors cannot be manufactured in large quantities and gasoline is lacking, we should first vigorously promote and improve new animal-powered farm implements on the basis of cooperation.

    第一机械工业部第一机器工业管理局召开会议
    决定努力改进和推广新式畜力农具
    第一机械工业部第一机器工业管理局从十月九日到十九日，召开了全国农具制造会议。会议研究和讨论了一九五五年全国农具生产任务，以及今后有关农具制造的问题。
    会议首先指出，由于全国互助合作运动的迅速发展，到今年八月止，全国农业生产合作社已发展到十万个以上。据各地计划，到一九五五年春耕时，农业生产合作社将发展到五十万个以上。因此，一九五五年制造与推广新农具将是一项很繁重的任务。会议根据实际需要制订了今后（今年十一月起到明年年底）农具生产计划：畜力农具八种，计七十万部，其中双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁占五十多万部。此外，还有中耕器、收割机、钉齿耙、圆盘耙、播种机和脱粒机。
    会议又对提高农具的质量、降低成本、生产协作、供销等等问题，进行了专题研究和讨论。过去，在推广新农具中，农民的一般反映是“式样多”，“规格、标准不统一”，“坏了零件不好配”，“用不起”等等。第一机器工业管理局对于上述问题，曾在会前进行了研究。并曾组织工程师和有关人员，对双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁、中耕器、十行播种机、十二行播种机等五种农具的图纸，进行了标定工作（其中双轮双铧犁经标定后，又由北京农业机械厂试制成功，试验证明成绩良好）。会上，北京农业机械厂总工程师李克佐报告了该厂制造双轮双铧犁的经过，第一机器工业管理局技术处陈幼君工程师报告了新产品试制和技术检查工作。会议并解决了某些标准件如犁铧、螺钉、犁镜的统一供应问题。如：螺钉由沈阳螺钉厂统一供应，犁铧则由东北灵山农具厂统一供应，以求保证质量和达到零件互换的目的。会议并研究了农业部、第一机械工业部和中华全国供销合作总社即将签订的关于一九五五年制造推广和供应双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁的协议书。
    这次会议，使到会干部认识到：在我国目前还不能大量制造拖拉机和缺乏汽油的情况下，首先应在合作化的基础上，大力推广和改进新式畜力农具。
