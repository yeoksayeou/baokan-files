    For a long time, I have cherished the desire to visit this great country. Today, this wish has been realized, and I am very happy.
    Since the dawn of history, India and China have coexisted in an atmosphere of perfect friendship and mutual harmony. There have been many connections between the two countries—cultural, commercial, and religious. However, in recent centuries, this benevolent interaction has been interrupted. But this page of history has come full circle, and we are now starting to restore our old ties.
    It is extremely important to understand each other and further strengthen our historical friendship. China and India are both large countries, facing similar problems, and both have resolutely embarked on the road of progress. The deeper these two countries understand each other, the more assured the welfare of not only Asia but also the whole world will be. The tensions that exist in the world today require us to work together for peace.
    I hope that my visit to China will bring us closer together, and we will work together with redoubled enthusiasm for the cause of peace.
    I bring you the respect and good wishes of the Indian people. I have only been in China for one day, but the cordial and spontaneous welcome I have received in Guangzhou and Hankou is already deeply touching. I sincerely thank you for the warm feelings you have shown.

    尼赫鲁总理在北京机场上的谈话
    长久以来，我就怀抱着访问这一伟大国家的愿望。今天，这个愿望得到了实现，我感到很高兴。
    从历史的黎明开始，印度和中国一直就在完美的友谊和相互和谐的气氛中共处着。两国之间有过许多联系——文化的、商业的以及宗教的联系。然而，在近几世纪中，这种善意的交往曾经遭到中断。但是这一页历史已经循环了一周，我们现在重新开始恢复旧有的联系。
    使我们彼此了解和进一步加强我们的历史友谊，是极其重要的。中国和印度都是大国，面对着类似的问题，并且都已坚决地走上前进的道路。这两个国家彼此了解愈深，那么不仅亚洲的福利，而且全世界的福利就愈有保证。今天世界上存在的紧张局势，要求我们共同为和平而努力。
    我希望，我的访问中国将使我们相互更为亲密，我们将一起以加倍的热诚来为和平事业而努力。
    我给你们带来了印度人民的敬意和良好愿望。我来到中国还只有一天，但是我在广州和汉口所受到的亲切而自发的欢迎已经是情意深长的。我衷心感谢你们所表现的热烈的感情。
