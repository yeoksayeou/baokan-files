Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 26th: Pakistan's Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad declared a state of emergency throughout Pakistan on the 24th and dissolved the Constituent Assembly. Ghulam Muhammad has asked the current Prime Minister Muhammad Ali to reorganize the cabinet and assume national administrative duties until the general election is held.

    A statement issued by the Governor-General's Office of Pakistan on the 24th said that "after considering the political crisis facing the country," Ghulam Muhammad "regretfully came to the conclusion that the constitutional mechanism has disintegrated." The statement said that the Constituent Assembly, in its current composition, can no longer "function." The statement announced that a general election would be held as soon as possible.

    Due to the political crisis, Pakistani Prime Minister Ali, who arrived in Washington earlier this month to negotiate with the U.S. government on accepting U.S. military aid, rushed back to Karachi on the 23rd. The new cabinet formed by Ali on the 24th includes seven cabinet members. Ali serves as Prime Minister, concurrently in charge of foreign affairs and transportation. In addition to four former cabinet members, the new cabinet members include Defense Minister General Muhammad Ayub Khan and Minister of Interior and Frontier Affairs Major General Iskander Mirza. Ayub Khan was originally the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army and recently accompanied Ali to Washington to participate in US-Pakistan negotiations. Mirza served as provincial governor after the United Front government in East Pakistan was dissolved.
