Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit group once again rampantly violated international law on October 14th, ordering the confiscation of 8,205 tons of coal carried by the Japanese merchant ship "Nisshu Maru," which was illegally detained in Taiwan. The "Nisshu Maru" loaded coal from Qinhuangdao purchased by Pakistan from China in September. While en route to Pakistan, it sought refuge from a typhoon in Keelung Port, Taiwan, and was illegally detained by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group. The "Nisshu Maru's" plight once again demonstrates that the piracy of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group, under the direction of the United States, is increasingly damaging and threatening the principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas, as well as normal trade between China and other countries.

    蒋贼劫夺日船所载煤炭
    【新华社十九日讯】蒋介石卖国集团十月十四日又猖狂地破坏国际公法，命令没收被非法扣留在台湾的日本商船“日洲丸”载运的八千二百零五吨煤。“日洲丸”是在九月间从秦皇岛装运巴基斯坦向我国购买的煤以后，在驶往巴基斯坦途中由于躲避台风驶入台湾的基隆港而被蒋介石卖国集团非法扣留的。“日洲丸”的遭遇再次说明，蒋介石卖国集团在美国指使之下进行的海盗行为，已经越来越严重地破坏和威胁公海航行自由的原则以及我国和其他各国之间的正常贸易。
