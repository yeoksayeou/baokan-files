    Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory Produces More Than 300 New Products
    The Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory of the Ministry of Geology was reorganized from a railway factory. Last year, the factory could only produce 73 kinds of simple products such as iron and steel grit drill bits and core drill bits. This year, with the help of Soviet experts, the factory successfully trial-produced 376 new products from January to September, over fulfilling the trial production plan and production plan. The diesel engine fuel injectors, plunger bushings, and cores that the factory could not manufacture in the past have now begun to be produced in large quantities. Mud mixers, coarse crushers, fine crushers, core splitting machines, etc. have also been successfully manufactured. These new products have been supplied to exploration teams across the country in a timely manner.
    The factory received assistance from Soviet experts in the trial production of new products. In the past eight months, the experts put forward a total of 114 suggestions, of which the factory has implemented 102, overcoming many difficulties. For example, in the past, 70% to 80% of the cast horizontal shaft copper sleeves and guide copper sleeves were scrapped due to pinholes. Thanks to the help of experts, the composition of copper casting materials and the gating method of sand molds were changed, eliminating pinholes in castings, and the yield rate reached 90% to 95%.
    Since the beginning of this year, the factory has promoted nine kinds of Soviet advanced experiences, such as the Kolesov tool holder method, high-speed thread milling method, high-speed thread picking method, and tire-shaped forging method, which have generally increased production efficiency by one to five times. In the past, the Wang Yongshou team needed 366 minutes to forge a horizontal machine gear. After adopting the advanced tire-shaped forging method, it only took 99 minutes to complete one, and the quality reached 100%.
    The factory also promptly put forward key production technologies and organized everyone to solve them. In nine months, all employees put forward a total of 286 rationalization proposals, of which 131 have been implemented. For example, veteran workers Xu Baoshan, Cheng Guanzhong, etc., with the help of technicians, created a pier tube machine, which solved a key problem for the entire factory; young welder Chang Xiaoyuhong and others suggested using cold air instead of oxygen to weld hard alloy cutting edges successfully, which enabled the smooth completion of the trial production task of the new product of round drill bits with inlaid alloy blades.
    With the increase in new products, the factory's supply range has increased from two exploration teams last year to exploration teams all over the country, strongly supporting national industrial construction.

    张家口探矿机械厂制成三百多种新产品
    中央地质部张家口探矿机械厂是由铁路工厂改组而成的。在去年，该厂仅能生产铁砂和钢砂钻头以及岩心钻头等七十三种简单的产品。今年该厂在苏联专家帮助之下，从一月到九月共试制成功了三百七十六种新产品，超额完成了试制计划和生产计划。原来该厂不能制造的柴油机的喷油嘴、柱塞轴套及芯子，现在已开始大批生产，泥浆搅拌机、粗碎矿机、细碎矿机、岩心劈开机等也已制造成功，这些新产品都及时供应了全国各地的勘探队的需要。
    该厂在新产品试制工作中，得到了苏联专家的帮助。在过去的八个多月，专家共提出建议一百一十四件，该厂已执行一百零二件，克服了许多困难。如横轴铜套、导管铜套等过去铸出来有百分之七、八十因有砂眼造成废品，由于专家帮助，改变了铸铜配料成份和砂型浇口方法，消灭了铸件砂眼，成品率达到了百分之九十到九十五以上。
    今年以来，该厂共推行了九种苏联先进经验，如科列索夫车刀法、高速铣丝法、高速挑扣法、胎型锻造法等，使生产效率普遍提高一倍到五倍。王永寿小组过去需三百六十六分钟锻造一个横机牙轮，采用先进胎型锻造法后，有九十九分钟就完成了一个，质量达到百分之百。
    该厂还及时提出了生产技术关键，组织大家解决。在九个月中全体职工共提出二百八十六件合理化建议，现已实现了一百三十一件。如老工人徐宝山、程关忠等在技术人员帮助下，创造了墩管机，解决了全厂关键问题；青年焊工长肖玉洪等建议用冷风代替氧气焊接硬质合金刀刃成功，使圆钻头镶合金刃新产品试制任务顺利完成。
    随着新产品的增加，该厂的供应范围由去年的两个勘探队增加到全国各地的勘探队，有力地支援了国家工业建设。
