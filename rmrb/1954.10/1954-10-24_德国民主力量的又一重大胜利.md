Another Major Victory for Democratic Forces in Germany
　　Cheng Wen

    The German Democratic Republic held elections for the People's Chamber on October 17th, and the final official results announced on the 21st showed that 98.41 percent of the electorate participated in the voting; and 99.46 percent of those who voted supported the list of candidates, including representatives from all strata of society, proposed by the National Front of Democratic Germany. This is undoubtedly another major victory for the democratic forces in Germany.

    The holding of the People's Chamber election in the German Democratic Republic is a major event in the political life of Democratic Germany, and it is of great significance not only for the German Democratic Republic but also for the whole of Germany.

    Five years ago, the democratic and progressive forces of Germany established the first peace-loving country in German history - the German Democratic Republic - on the ruins of the eastern part of the country, which had been destroyed by war. In the past five years, the German Democratic Republic has been continuously developed and consolidated in all aspects. The state power of the Republic is now completely in the hands of the working class and the working peasants. The anti-fascist democratic system has become an unshakable foundation of this country. With the help of the Soviet Union and the cooperation of the people's democratic countries, the national economy of the German Democratic Republic has developed rapidly. Because the government and people of the German Democratic Republic have steadfastly pursued a policy of peace and friendship among nations over the years, the international influence of the German Democratic Republic has grown day by day and has won the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world. Although U.S. imperialism has been trying to weaken this young country in every possible way over the years, and has even launched large-scale provocations and subversive activities against it, it still cannot shake its foundation in the slightest. Today, the German Democratic Republic has become a strong fortress for all peace-loving and democratic forces in Germany. The results of the People's Chamber election in the German Democratic Republic clearly show that the people of Democratic Germany have expressed great trust and support for the leading forces of their country - the National Front led by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany - thereby further strengthening the power of the German Democratic Republic.

    The trust shown by the people of the German Democratic Republic in the leading forces leading their country is not accidental. When the first People's Chamber election was held in 1950, the National Front included raising the people's living standards as one of its important tasks in the program it proposed. In the past four years, the German Democratic Republic, based on the great achievements it has made in developing the national economy according to this program, has continuously implemented measures to reduce prices, reduce taxes, increase wages, and expand social welfare, so that the living standards of the working people have been significantly improved. In the German Democratic Republic, a thriving scene is everywhere, and the people are living an increasingly happy life. This is in sharp contrast to the painful life of unemployment and poverty suffered by West German residents because the Adenauer government followed the United States' policy of rearming West Germany. Based on their personal experience over the past few years, the people of the German Democratic Republic are fully convinced that all the policies and activities of the government of the German Democratic Republic are in line with the interests of the German people; the path of development followed by the German Democratic Republic is the only correct path that can make Germany prosperous and strong on a peaceful and democratic basis. This is why the broad masses of the people in the German Democratic Republic welcomed the People's Chamber election with great enthusiasm and wholeheartedly supported their people's democratic system in the election.

    For all the German people, the most urgent issue at present is to restore the unification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. Because only by establishing an independent, unified, democratic and peaceful Germany can the freedom, happiness and peace of all the German people be guaranteed. Under the leadership of the National Front led by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the German Democratic Republic has consistently striven for such goals in the past five years, and has put forward various statements and proposals more than fifty times in order to seek a peaceful solution to the German question as soon as possible. Because of pursuing this policy of safeguarding the national interests of Germany, the National Front has won increasing trust among the broad masses in East and West Germany. In this election, the election manifesto put forward by the National Front to the voters is a program of peace, a program for restoring the unification of Germany on a democratic basis. It advocates resuming the interrupted negotiations on the German question, calling on "Germans, sit down at a table!", opposing the remilitarization of West Germany, and striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of national unification. These clear programs undoubtedly express the common aspirations of all the German people. The people of Democratic Germany voted to support the candidates of the National Front because they supported the National Front's program of striving for the peaceful unification of Germany and agreed with the path it pointed out for the peaceful solution of the German question. Therefore, the result of the election in the German Democratic Republic convincingly reflects the strong will of the German people to restore the unification of Germany.

    As everyone knows, in the national referendum held in June this year, the vast majority of people in the German Democratic Republic expressed their will against division and remilitarization and demanded the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of national unification. This demand of the German people has become increasingly strong with the development of the international situation. In the recent election, they expressed in a united action that they would never allow the solution of the German question to be delayed and obstructed any longer. This firm will of the German people cannot be ignored.

    After the end of the Berlin Conference, the German question has not been removed from the international agenda. The Soviet Union continued to make tireless efforts to seek a solution to the German question. Especially after the bankruptcy of the "European Defense Community" treaty, the possibility of a peaceful solution to the German question has greatly increased. However, the Western countries are determined to divide Germany and divide Europe. They rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to reopen the Four-Power Conference to discuss the German question, and are committed to pursuing a new plan to revive West German militarism. They formulated a so-called "London Agreement" to replace the bankrupt "Paris Treaty". The Western countries are now stepping up their activities to implement the "London Agreement" plan, which puts the European countries in the face of a new threat of the rapid revival of German militarism, and at the same time puts the road to a peaceful solution to the German question in danger of being blocked. Therefore, the task of the people of European countries, especially the German people, to strive for the establishment of a truly democratic, independent, unified and peaceful Germany has become very urgent.

    Now is the time for all the German people to unite and strengthen the struggle for a common goal. As Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic rightly pointed out not long ago: "The question at present is not how one party can defeat another party, but how all peace-loving people can defeat the forces of those monopoly capitalists who are dividing and enslaving Germany, and how to defeat the Junker landlords and fascist militarist forces whose central representative is the Adenauer government." All patriots in East and West Germany must unite under the banner of the German Democratic Republic and strive to restore the unification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. The current domestic and international situation in Germany is conducive to this struggle. In his speech at the Berlin celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, Molotov, head of the Soviet government delegation, stated that the Soviet government is ready to consider the proposals previously put forward by the participating countries of the Berlin Conference on the solution of the German question and the new proposals that may be put forward on the issue of all-German elections, which provides new favorable conditions for the peaceful solution of the German question. As long as the German people and the people of European countries rise up to defeat the conspiracy to remilitarize West Germany, it will be possible to achieve a peaceful solution to the German question. And the victory of the people of Democratic Germany in this election has an undeniable significance for the further development of this great struggle.

    德国民主力量的又一重大胜利
  　程文
    德意志民主共和国在十月十七日举行了人民议院的选举，二十一日发表的选举的最后正式结果表明，选民人数的百分之九十八点四一参加了投票；而百分之九十九点四六的投票者投票赞成由民主德国全国阵线所提出的包括各阶层代表人物在内的候选人名单。这无疑是德国民主力量的又一个重大胜利。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院选举的举行，是民主德国政治生活中的重大事件，它不仅对于德意志民主共和国而且对于整个德国都有十分重要的意义。
    五年以前，德国的民主进步力量在被战争毁坏的东部废墟上建立了德国历史上第一个爱好和平的国家——德意志民主共和国。五年来，德意志民主共和国已在各方面得到了不断的发展与巩固。共和国的国家权力已经完全掌握在工人阶级和劳动农民的手中。反法西斯的民主制度已成为这个国家的不可动摇的基础。在苏联的帮助和各人民民主国家的合作下，德意志民主共和国的国民经济有了迅速的发展。由于德意志民主共和国政府和人民这些年来坚持不渝地执行了和平和各民族友好的政策，德意志民主共和国的国际影响已一天比一天扩大，并得到了全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持。尽管美帝国主义这些年来一直在千方百计地企图削弱这个年青的国家，甚至对它发动了大规模的挑衅和颠覆活动，也仍然丝毫不能动摇它的基础。今天，德意志民主共和国已经成为全德国爱好和平民主力量的坚强堡垒了。这次德意志民主共和国人民议院的选举结果清楚地表明，民主德国人民对自己国家的领导力量——以德国统一社会党为首的全国阵线表示了极大的信任和支持，从而进一步加强了德意志民主共和国的力量。
    德意志民主共和国人民对于领导自己国家的领导力量所表现的信任，并不是偶然的。在一九五○年举行第一届人民议院选举的时候，全国阵线提出的纲领中曾把提高人民生活水平列为自己的重要任务之一。四年来，德意志民主共和国根据这个纲领，在发展国民经济所取得的巨大成就的基础上不断地实行了减低物价、降低税额、增加工资，扩大社会福利事业的措施，使劳动人民的生活水平有了显著的提高。在德意志民主共和国内，到处都呈现着欣欣向荣的景气，人民过着日益幸福的生活。这和西德居民因为阿登纳政府追随美国重新武装西德政策而遭到的失业、贫困的痛苦生活，成为鲜明的对照。德意志民主共和国人民根据几年来的亲身体验，完全确信德意志民主共和国政府的一切政策和活动都是符合于德国人民的利益的；德意志民主共和国所遵循的发展道路，是能够使德国在和平民主基础上繁荣兴盛的唯一正确的道路。这就是为什么德意志民主共和国广大人民以极大的热情来迎接这次人民议院的选举，并在选举中竭诚拥护自己的人民民主制度。
    对于全体德国人民来说，当前最紧要的问题是在和平民主基础上恢复德国的统一。因为只有建立一个独立、统一、民主与和平的德国，全体德国人民的自由、幸福与和平才能获得保证。在以德国统一社会党为首的全国阵线领导下，德意志民主共和国过去五年来始终不渝地为这样的目标奋斗，并曾先后五十多次提出各种声明和建议，以谋求迅速实现德国问题的和平解决。由于奉行这种维护德国民族利益的政策，全国阵线在东德和西德的广大群众中取得了日益增大的信任。在这次选举中，全国阵线向选民提出的选举宣言，就是一个和平的纲领，是一个在民主基础上恢复德国统一的纲领。它主张恢复中断了的德国问题的谈判，号召“德国人，坐到一张桌子旁来！”，反对西德重新军国主义化，争取缔结和约和恢复国家的统一。这些鲜明的纲领无庸置疑是表达了全体德国人民的共同愿望的。民主德国人民投票支持全国阵线的候选人，就是因为他们拥护全国阵线争取和平统一德国的纲领，赞成它所指出的和平解决德国问题的道路。因此，德意志民主共和国选举的结果令人信服地反映了德国人民要求恢复德国统一的强烈意志。
    大家知道，在今年六月举行的全国性投票中，德意志民主共和国绝大多数的人就曾表示了他们反对分裂和重新军国主义化的意志，要求迅速缔结和约和恢复国家统一。德国人民这种要求随着国际局势的发展而日益强烈，他们在最近的选举中，以团结一致的行动表示，绝不容许再拖延和阻挠德国问题的解决。德国人民的这种坚强的意志是不能忽视的。
    柏林会议结束以后，德国问题并没有从国际日程上除掉。苏联继续不倦地进行了新的努力，来谋求解决德国问题。特别是在“欧洲防务集团”条约破产后，和平解决德国问题的可能性是大大增加了。但是西方国家一心要分裂德国和分裂欧洲，它们拒绝了苏联关于重开四国会议讨论德国问题的建议，而致力于追求复活西德军国主义的新计划，它们制订了一个所谓“伦敦协议”来代替已经破产的
  “巴黎条约”。西方国家现在正在加紧活动来实施
  “伦敦协议”的计划，这就使得欧洲各国又面临德国军国主义迅速复活的新威胁，同时使和平解决德国问题的道路也有被堵塞的危险。因此，欧洲各国人民，首先是德国人民，争取建立一个真正民主、独立、统一与和平的德国的任务就成为十分迫切的了。
    现在是全体德国人民团结起来为共同的目标而加强斗争的时候了。正如德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥不久以前所正确指出的：“目前的问题并不是一个党如何战胜另外一个党，而是一切爱好和平的人民如何战胜那些正在分裂和奴役德国的垄断资本家的力量，如何战胜那些以阿登纳政府为集中代表的容克地主和法西斯军国主义势力。”东德和西德一切爱国人士必须团结在德意志民主共和国的旗帜下，争取在和平民主的基础上恢复德国的统一。当前德国国内外的形势都是有利于这一斗争的。苏联政府代表团团长莫洛托夫在柏林庆祝德意志民主共和国成立五周年大会上的讲话中表示：苏联政府准备考虑柏林会议的参与国以前提出关于解决德国问题的建议以及在全德选举问题上可能提出的新建议，这就给和平解决德国问题提出新的有利条件。只要德国人民和欧洲各国人民起来击败使西德重新军国主义化的阴谋，就有可能实现德国问题的和平解决。而民主德国人民在这一次选举中的胜利，对于这一伟大斗争的进一步开展有着不可忽视的意义。
