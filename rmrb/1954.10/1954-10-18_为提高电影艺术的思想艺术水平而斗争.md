Since the founding of New China, the Chinese people's film industry has developed rapidly. In the past five years, we have produced a total of fifty-seven feature films, seventy-two feature-length documentaries, one hundred and forty short documentaries, forty science and education films, over three hundred newsreels and special features, and a number of animated films; and we have dubbed one hundred and ninety-nine feature films and twenty feature-length documentaries from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries. In February 1953, the state finally acquired some privately owned film studios, making the film industry completely state-owned. In January 1954, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Strengthening Film Production Work" and the "Decision on Establishing a Film Screening Network and Film Industry," which clarified the production guidelines for various types of films and the development direction of the film industry, which is of great significance for the future development of the film industry. According to the instructions of the Central Government, we successively established news and documentary film studios and science and education film studios, and began to produce animated films. It should be particularly pointed out that some Chinese film artists have devoted themselves to the dubbing of films from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries with the greatest enthusiasm and creative labor, and have achieved great results. At present, apart from the military, there are more than 2,000 film projection teams regularly touring factories, mines, and rural areas, and they are continuing to be actively developed in a planned manner. The number of film viewers has increased from 146 million in 1950 to 752 million in 1953; film art has become a huge force for carrying out patriotic and socialist education for the broad masses of the people and an indispensable part of people's cultural life.

In old China, it was fundamentally impossible for films to truly represent the conscious struggle of the Chinese working people. How to give play to the huge educational role of film, the most popular and easily accepted artistic weapon, for the broad masses of the people, was only an ideal dreamed of by progressive film artists at that time. Only in the new China is it possible to begin to truthfully and vividly represent the conscious struggle of our people, to represent the awakened Chinese people who have truly stood up; especially to represent the leading force of the Party in the realistic struggle; to represent those most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, some ordinary soldiers—Communists—in the great revolutionary struggle, with their heroic spirit and noble qualities. For thirty years, they have struggled arduously for the people, for the motherland, and for the communist ideal, advancing wave upon wave, regarding death as home, and experiencing a difficult and tortuous road. True people, brave people, and noble people have appeared on the screen. These optimistic and cheerful images have become examples for thousands of people to move forward in life. Therefore, the important role of film art among the broad masses of the people has begun to exert unparalleled power.

Precisely because of this, when our films truthfully and vividly represent the people's struggle and the atmosphere of new China, our films are also greatly welcomed internationally; to date, Chinese films have been screened in dozens of countries in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Southeast Asia. Many excellent films have won various awards at previous international film festivals.

The development of the film industry has achieved its existing achievements due to the constant concern and correct leadership of the Party and the government, and it is the result of our resolute implementation of the Party's literary and artistic line through various struggles, thereby laying the foundation for socialist realism in film art.

The Party has adhered to the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the film industry, and launched a serious struggle against those tendencies that express workers, peasants, and soldiers with petty-bourgeois and bourgeois viewpoints and tastes, actually distorting the image of our people's struggle, and propagating petty-bourgeois and bourgeois reactionary viewpoints and ideas. The Party Central Committee launched a severe criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," which sounded a timely alarm for us. Therefore, it has guaranteed the combat principled nature of film art, and further clarified the importance of adhering to the Party's literary and artistic line.

Also because the Party put forward criticisms on certain film art creations, the Film Bureau successively convened film script creation meetings and film art work meetings in the spring of 1953, universally carried out the study of socialist realism, and the research of Soviet film art creation, and conducted inspections on the shortcomings of film art creation.

After this meeting, the situation of literary script creation has obviously improved somewhat. Among the many literary scripts completed last year, excellent scripts such as "Song Jingshi," "Hassen and Jamila," "Reconnaissance Across the River," and "Land" were produced.

However, there are still some serious shortcomings in film art creation. How to strive to improve the ideological and artistic level of film art is still an extremely serious task before us.

To improve the quality of films, the key lies in the development and quality improvement of literary script creation. And the organizational work of film script creation should first be correctly resolved.

Due to the mass nature and huge educational role of film art, the broad scope of film art creation themes, and the unique, profound and moving power of film art in expressing life, the Party and the people require film art to widely express our country's great socialist transformation cause that is underway in all aspects.

In the past year, the connection between the Film Bureau and writers has also been strengthened. Publications such as "People's Literature," "Liberation Army Literature and Art," and "Literary Monthly" have all published film literary scripts. Film script creation is obviously becoming more active. However, this is still far from the needs of the film industry. Many writers have not yet come into contact with film art.

Many writers have not yet shaken off their concerns about the form of film art. It cannot be denied that a film script is an independent literary form with its complex characteristics. It needs to express themes with long-lasting and significant meanings in life, needs a high degree of concentration and generalization, profoundly reveals sharp and complex conflicts in life through intense dramatic actions, endows characters with clear action to portray their character development, and all of this must seek vivid and perfect film forms that meet the needs of the content. The wider the themes expressed by the film, the more diverse the genre requirements, the more it requires literary works to fully develop the characteristics of film art, and further enrich the language expression ability of the film.

Therefore, the Film Bureau and the Writers Association still need to continue to strengthen the connection between writers and the film industry, and take active encouragement and help writers master various methods of film form. Such as advocating cooperation between writers and film directors, the youth writer film script workshop to be held soon by the Film Bureau and the Writers Association, and strengthening the criticism work of film and literary scripts, etc. It should be admitted that our criticism work in film art creation has been very poor. Few film script reviews were published in newspapers and magazines last year. Film reviews that deeply and meticulously analyze film art creation are still very lacking.

Another important issue in the organization of film script work is to correctly formulate film script theme plans. Since the production of films with some major themes and topics requires a longer preparation time, the Film Bureau needs to formulate a longer-term theme plan to ensure planned film production. The film script theme plan is the fundamental plan for film production. This theme plan should embody the spirit of socialist realism and take into account the role of film as a major weapon in our country's socialist transformation cause. The formulation of theme plans should mainly be based on the creation plans proposed by writers themselves with a certain life foundation, and determined after review and deemed suitable for film production needs; but at the same time, suggestions should also be made to writers based on the needs of national construction and the needs of society, and actively encourage and help writers formulate new creation plans.

Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have been mainly engaged in armed revolutionary struggles for a long time in the cruel struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is inseparable from the victory of the People's Liberation War. Therefore, films depicting the great People's Liberation War have accounted for a considerable proportion in the past. In the future, themes depicting revolutionary war will still account for a certain proportion. However, in the five years since the founding of New China, the people of the whole country have been fighting with full confidence for socialist transformation under the leadership of the Party, and countless inspiring deeds have emerged in the process. These new people and new things are precisely the concentrated expression of socialist ideology unfolding fierce struggles against all old ideas and non-socialist ideas, and unfolding sharp new and old conflicts in life. The sharp and complex struggle between all new and old things in every corner of life caused by the great struggle of socialist transformation, the drastic changes in class relations, the relationship between people, the emergence of new qualities, new ideas and feelings, and new moral ethics, should be and must be the most important objects of expression and depiction in film art. Only in this way can film art more powerfully strengthen the socialist ideological education of the people.

However, the scope of themes expressed by our film art is still relatively narrow. To date, no film has yet been produced to depict the great struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers in defending world peace and resisting American imperialist aggression; the modernized and nationalized construction of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the fighting posture of guarding the frontier day and night and participating in socialist construction; the unparalleled perseverance, wisdom, and creative labor shown by the working class in various national construction projects; the great struggle of the vast rural areas moving towards cooperative roads with great enthusiasm; the great efforts and achievements of the Chinese people in social reform and economic recovery and development in the past five years... all have not yet been vividly and sufficiently reflected on the screen.

Films are also very insufficient in reflecting national unity, especially in reflecting the new atmosphere of the huge reforms in production and changes in life of ethnic minorities since the beginning of history. Films have never reflected the various lives of the vast number of young people who are vigorously engaged in learning and building the motherland, such as: school life, technical schools, exploration teams, the Communist Youth League, and the Young Pioneers. There are also very few films suitable for children and young people.

In short, in such a rich and vast field of life, film art is still facing a vast undeveloped garden! We cannot but appeal to writers, playwrights, and screenwriters across the country, asking them to strive to supply a large number of literary scripts for new themes for films.

The narrowness of themes not only affects film art's inability to well reflect the whole picture of national construction, but also restricts the creativity of film art. The breadth of themes and the diversity of genres are unified requirements for film production. Broad themes need to seek different styles and patterns of film art and forms that correspond to the content to express. The lack of broad themes also greatly limits the rich diversity of film art expression and hinders the improvement and development of artistic creation; this is also the fundamental reason why styles of films such as comedies, biographies, and fairy tales have not yet been produced.

In order to improve the quality of film art and improve the ideological and artistic quality of films, it is necessary to strive to overcome the current unfavorable tendencies in film art creation, various manifestations of conceptualization, and certain naturalistic tendencies in creation.

The ideological and artistic nature of film art, its concentrated expression of Party spirit, is to prominently portray vivid, flesh-and-blood, distinct, and personalized positive characters on the screen, reaching a completely truthful and credible level, being able to excite the audience, and encouraging them to emulate them and use them as role models. This character is an ordinary person, an ordinary soldier, but he concentrates the excellent typical characteristics of new qualities. He is a living person with his own personality, actions, language, habits, thoughts and feelings. They are not "preachers" and bystanders without action in the boiling sound of life, but actively participate in the fiery struggle with full personality and action.

Many of our films lack power and exciting things when expressing life and exposing conflicts in life, and have not left the masses with an unforgettable, true and moving positive character image. Some of our plays drive the characters in the work to do this or that correct thing and say this or that correct language according to the author's own concept, instead of following their own path according to the development of the character in the struggle, doing what they want to do, and saying what they want to say. The author is only busy explaining "important issues" and "policies" to the audience, trying to explain too many "issues" in one film, and forgetting that the basic feature of art is to reflect life through depicting people and describing the growth of characters.

The great socialist transformation cause we are carrying out is carried out by living, flesh-and-blood, concrete individuals. Reflected on the screen, it must be the conflict of personalities between people. If our films can fully express the struggle of positive characters in real life to maintain and support new things, and the fierce conflict with various backward characters, this film will have the dramatic quality required by film art, give the positive characters clear and strong action, and develop the plot in a truly fascinating way. If this kind of conflict between characters cannot be unfolded, the conflict of life cannot be unfolded, and there will be no real plot; the positive characters will not be able to have any real struggle. We must emphasize that an engaging plot and a tight structure are indispensable important factors for an excellent film. The plot determines the depth of characterization to a considerable extent. The plot is the basis for a deeper and more vivid depiction of character personality and the development of the plot to reveal the conflicts of life. However, our film scripts often ignore the plot. This is often a basic reason why the personalities of the positive characters in our films lack clear action and their personalities are not fully developed. Gorky instructed us: "The plot is the history of character." This sentence has profound implications for our film art today and is worthy of our consideration.

Another important aspect of positive character creation is to correctly depict their rich and diverse mental outlook in struggle and labor. The sharpness and complexity of the realistic struggle will inevitably lead to changes in people's character, changes in people's thoughts and feelings, and changes in the relationship between people. These changes make people's inner activities and mental outlook complex and rich. It is impossible to vividly and comprehensively portray the character characteristics without deeply exploring the inner world of people. Simple expression of the mental outlook of positive characters, presenting them as simple-minded people, lacking emotional life, and lacking passion in struggle, is a slander to the heroic image of our era and a distortion of life. How can we imagine that a person who has no love for life, is indifferent in struggle, and has no passion will fight selflessly for our ideals? Many of our works only express the production process, technology, and struggle process, but do not truly express people's thoughts and feelings; love, family, friends, certain joys and sorrows in life, and the pain and passion of setbacks in struggle are surprisingly rare in works, only barely enough to be a decoration of life; thus, only political preaching and smooth "positive characters" are left in the works; this is neither life nor art.

Of course, this is not at all what some people think, that the so-called expression of mental outlook is just a matter of percentage, just adding some personal life or some thoughts, adding some feelings to production labor, let alone going to "boldly express" the "momentary wavering" of positive characters when faced with serious tests, and to impose certain shortcomings on the characters in order to "characterize" the positive characters, believing that positive characters will also have some reverse characteristics, so that the character is vivid, complex, and conforms to the "reality" of life. What we require is to realistically reflect the true situation of work and life, family and society, labor and social activities, thoughts and feelings, etc., which are always integrated in our daily struggle and life, in a reasonable and true manner according to the development of the character and the development of the plot.

This question also answers questions such as whether to expose unhealthy and backward phenomena in our life, whether to write negative characters, and whether to conduct criticism and self-criticism. These are precisely the questions that cannot be avoided when expressing positive characters. Isn't the courage of positive characters to fight against unhealthy and backward phenomena in struggle and life, the courage to conduct arduous struggles with negative characters, and the courage to conduct criticism and self-criticism precisely a rich and diverse expression of mental outlook?

The erroneous view of creating positive character types seriously hinders our progress towards socialist realism. This defect also exists in the creation of directors and actors. Directors and actors also often dare not boldly highlight the character of the characters, express the inner world of the characters, and express the conflict of personalities between people in the work of handling roles and creating characters. As a result, our film art cannot create brilliant types of new heroes on the screen, and cannot engrave unforgettable and distinct images on the hearts of thousands of viewers.

To fight for the improvement of the ideological and artistic level of film art, the fundamental problem lies here.

In addition, while we are fighting against the tendency of conceptualization and formalism, certain naturalistic tendencies have also emerged in our artistic creation. Some creators have some misunderstandings about the authenticity of artistic expression of life; they are satisfied with the enumeration of some life phenomena, stick to the truth of local and individual phenomena of life, and ignore artistic processing, concentration, generalization and typicality. Some works lack the hard, serious, and earnest labor of creators. They just move it over "plainly" just to "look like life" because "life is like this," and dare not have any imagination and exaggeration in artistic creation, stifling the lively and lively creativity of art, making art an explanation of the production process, technology, etc., and reducing the ideological nature of art and the huge role of educating people with socialist spirit. It makes art a distorted, pale, or dirty photograph that distorts the truth of life. This is also a dangerous tendency in our creation today.

The above-mentioned erroneous tendencies are also manifested in the creation of other types of films. However, whether it is conceptualization, formalism, or certain naturalistic tendencies in creation, they all reflect a fundamental problem: film workers are not yet familiar with life; they do not have enough Marxist-Leninist cultivation, and they cannot deeply study and understand life. At the same time, our various creators still lack skilled skills; their understanding of skill training and improvement is not enough, and they do not understand that without a high degree of skill, it is impossible to depict such a complex and rich reality. If profound and complex ideological content cannot be given means suitable for the characteristics of film art and seek the most vivid and perfect film form, it is impossible to best complete the task of artistic creation.

Looking back at the achievements of the film industry in recent years and looking forward to tomorrow, we increasingly feel that our work is still far behind reality and behind the needs of the people; we increasingly feel that the tasks before us are serious, but we have confidence that under the light of the bright lighthouse of the Party's general line, we will advance under the banner of socialist realism, take Soviet films as our example, work harder, overcome the shortcomings in our work, and strive to improve the ideological and artistic level of the entire film art, in order to quickly create more and better excellent films worthy of the people.

    为提高电影艺术的思想艺术水平而斗争
    陈荒煤
    新中国建立以来，中国人民电影事业得到了迅速的发展。五年来，我们总共制作了故事片五十七部、长纪录片七十二部、短纪录片一百四十部、科学教育片四十部、三百余部新闻周报和特辑以及一部分美术片；并且，译制了苏联以及其他兄弟国家故事片一百九十九部及长纪录片二十部。一九五三年二月，国家最后收购了一部分私营的电影制片厂，使得电影事业完全国有化。一九五四年一月，中央人民政府政务院又发布了“关于加强电影制片工作的决定”和“关于建立电影放映网与电影工业的决定”，明确了各个片种的制片方针以及电影事业发展的方针，对今后电影事业的发展有极大的意义。根据中央的指示，我们相继建立了新闻纪录电影制片厂和科学教育电影制片厂，开始摄制了美术片。特别应该指出，中国一部分电影艺术工作者以最大的热情和创造性的劳动从事苏联以及人民民主国家的影片的译制工作，有很大的成绩。现在，除部队外，有二千多个电影放映队经常在工矿和农村巡回放映，还在继续有计划地积极加以发展。电影观众从一九五○年的一亿四千六百人次，增加到一九五三年的七亿五千二百万人次；电影艺术已成为对广大人民群众进行爱国主义和社会主义教育的巨大力量，成为人民文化生活中不可缺少的一个部分。
    在旧中国，电影根本不可能真正表现中国劳动人民的自觉的斗争。电影这一最为群众所喜爱、最易于接受的艺术武器，如何发挥它对广大人民巨大的教育作用，这只不过是当时进步电影艺术工作者梦寐以求的一种理想。只有在新的中国，才有可能开始真实、鲜明地表现我们人民的自觉的斗争，表现那觉醒了的真正站起来的中国人民；特别是表现那在现实斗争中党的领导力量；表现那些中华民族最优秀的子孙，在伟大的革命斗争中的一些普通战士——共产党员们的英雄气概和高贵品质。他们三十年来如一日，为了人民，为了祖国，为了共产主义理想，艰苦奋斗，前仆后继，视死如归，经历着艰辛曲折的道路。银幕上出现了真正的人、勇敢的人、崇高的人。这些乐观、明朗的形象，成为千万群众在生活中前进的榜样。因此，电影艺术在广大群众中的重大作用，才开始发出无比的威力来。
    也正因为这样，当我们电影真实、鲜明地表现了人民的斗争和新中国的气象，我们的影片在国际上也受到很大的欢迎；迄今为止，已有东欧、西欧、东南亚几十个国家放映过中国影片。许多优秀的影片，都在历届国际电影节中得到各种奖。
    电影事业的发展获得已有的成绩，是由于党和政府不断的关怀和正确的领导，是我们经过种种斗争，坚决贯彻党的文艺方针，从而奠定了电影艺术的社会主义现实主义的基础的结果。
    党在电影事业方面坚持了工农兵方向，向那些以小资产阶级、资产阶级观点和趣味来表现工农兵，实际上歪曲我们人民斗争形象，宣传小资产阶级、资产阶级反动观点和思想的倾向开展了严肃的斗争。党中央曾发起了对电影“武训传”的严厉批评，及时为我们敲起了警钟。因而保证了电影艺术战斗的原则性，也更加明确了坚持党的文艺方针的重要。
    也由于党对电影艺术的某些创作提出了批评，电影局在一九五三年春天陆续召开了电影剧本创作会议和电影艺术工作会议，普遍地进行社会主义现实主义的学习，对苏联电影艺术创作的研究，针对电影艺术创作的缺点进行了检查。
    经过这次会议后，文学剧本创作情况显然有些好转，去年完成的许多文学剧本中，曾产生了如
  “宋景诗”、“哈森与加米拉”、“渡江侦察记”、
  “土地”等优秀的剧本。
    但是，电影艺术创作方面还存在一些严重的缺点，如何努力提高电影艺术的思想艺术水平，仍是摆在我们面前极为严重的任务。
      要提高影片的质量，关键在于文学剧本的创作的发展和质量的提高。而电影剧本创作的组织工作，首先应该得到正确的解决。
    由于电影艺术的群众性和巨大的教育作用、电影艺术创作题材范围的广阔性、电影艺术表现生活的特有的、深刻动人的力量，党和人民要求电影艺术广泛地从各方面来表现我国正在进行的伟大的社会主义改造事业。
    近一年来电影局和作家们之间的联系也加强了，“人民文学”、“解放军文艺”、“文艺月报”等刊物，都发表了电影文学剧本。电影剧本创作显然比较活跃起来。可是，这和电影事业的需要来讲，还距离很远。许多作家还没有和电影艺术发生联系。
    许多作家还没有摆脱对电影艺术形式的顾虑。不能否认，电影剧本是一种独立的文学形式，有其复杂的特性。它需要表现生活中有长久性的重大意义的主题，需要高度的集中和概括，通过强烈的戏剧性的行动深刻揭示生活中尖锐、复杂的冲突，赋予人物鲜明的动作性以刻划其性格的发展，而这一切，必须寻求符合内容需要的鲜明的完美的电影形式。电影所表现的题材愈广阔，就愈要求体裁的多样性，就愈要求文学剧作充分发挥电影艺术的特性，更加丰富电影的语言表现能力。
    因此，电影局、作家协会还有必要继续加强作家同电影事业的联系，采取积极鼓励和帮助作家掌握电影形式种种办法。如提倡作家同电影编导的合作，最近电影局和作家协会即将举办的青年作家电影剧作讲习会，以及加强电影和文学剧本的批评工作等等。应该承认，我们在电影艺术创作方面的批评工作进行得很差。去年在报刊上很少发表电影剧本的评论。深刻、细致地对影片艺术创作进行分析的影评仍然很缺乏。
    在电影剧本组织工作方面的另一个重要的问题是正确地制定电影剧本的题材计划。由于一些重大主题和题材的影片制作工作需要较长时间准备，电影局需要拟订一个较长时期的题材计划，以保证有计划地制片。电影剧本题材计划是制片工作的根本计划，这个题材计划要体现着社会主义现实主义的精神，要考虑到电影这个重大武器对我国社会主义改造事业的作用。题材计划的拟订，主要的应该根据作家自己所提出的有一定生活基础的创作计划，经过审核认为适合电影制片需要来确定；但同时，也应该根据国家建设的需要，社会的需要，向作家提出建议，积极鼓励并帮助作家拟定新的创作计划。
    中国人民在共产党英明的领导下，在反对帝国主义及其走狗的残酷斗争中，长时间以来，主要是进行着武装的革命斗争，中国人民革命的胜利，是和人民解放战争的胜利分不开的。因此，表现伟大的人民解放战争的影片在过去占相当大的比重。今后，表现革命战争的题材仍会占一定的比重。但是，新中国成立五年来，全国人民在党的领导下，满怀信心地为了社会主义的改造而奋斗，这中间产生了无数振奋人心的事迹。这些新人新事，正是社会主义思想在和一切旧思想、非社会主义思想展开激烈的斗争中，在生活中展开尖锐的新旧冲突的集中表现。社会主义改造的伟大斗争所引起的生活各个角落的一切新旧事物之间的尖锐的、复杂的斗争，所引起阶级关系的、人和人之间关系的剧烈变化，新的品质、新的思想感情、新的道德伦理的产生，应该是、也必须是电影艺术最主要的表现和描绘的对象。只有这样，电影艺术才能更有力加强对人民的社会主义的思想教育。
    但是，我们电影艺术所表现的题材范围还是比较窄狭。至今为止，中国人民志愿军在保卫世界和平反抗美帝国主义侵略的伟大斗争，还没有一部影片予以表现；中国人民解放军现代化、国防化的建设、夜以继日地保卫边疆、参加社会主义建设的战斗姿态；工人阶级在国家各种建设中所表现的无比的毅力、智慧、创造性的劳动；广大农村正在热火朝天向合作道路前进的巨大斗争；中国人民在五年来社会改革以及经济恢复和发展中的巨大努力和成就……都还没有获得银幕上形象鲜明的足够的反映。
    电影在反映民族团结、特别是反映少数民族有史以来的生产的巨大改革及生活的变化的新气象方面也很不够。电影对广大青年的朝气勃勃地从事学习和建设祖国的各种生活，像：学校生活，技术学校、勘探队、青年团、少先队的活动，从来没有予以反映。适合少年儿童的影片也很少。
    总之，在如此丰富广大的生活领域中，电影艺术还面临着一片广阔的未开拓的园地！我们不能不向全国作家、剧作家、电影编剧呼吁，要求他们努力大量供应电影的新的题材的文学剧本。
    题材之窄狭不但影响到电影艺术不能很好地反映国家建设的全貌，也限制了电影艺术的创造性。题材的广阔和体裁的多样性是制片的一个统一的要求。广阔的题材须要寻求电影艺术自己的不同的风格、样式、同内容相适应的形式来表现。缺乏广阔的题材，也就大大限制了电影艺术表现丰富的多样性、妨碍着艺术创作的提高和发展；这也就是至今未能产生喜剧片、传记片、童话片等等样式影片的根本原因。
    为了提高电影艺术的质量，提高影片的思想性和艺术性，必须努力克服当前电影艺术创作不良的倾向，概念化的种种表现以及创作上某些自然主义的倾向。
    电影艺术的思想性和艺术性，它的党性的集中表现，是在银幕上突出地刻划出有血有肉、性格鲜明、有个性特征的正面人物，达到完全真实可信的程度，能够激动观众，以之鼓励自己去仿效、作为榜样。这个人物是普通的人、普通的战士，但是在他身上集中体现了新的品质的优秀的典型特征。他是一个活生生的、有自己的个性、动作、语言、习惯、思想感情的人。他们不是生活沸腾声中没有行动的“说教者”、旁观者，而是以充满性格的行动性积极参与了火热的斗争。
    我们有许多影片在表现生活、揭发生活中的冲突时，缺乏力量，缺乏激动人心的东西，没有给群众留下一个难忘的真实动人的正面人物形象。我们有些剧作，是按照作者自己的概念驱使作品中人物作这件或那件正确的事，说这样或那样正确的语言，而不依照人物在斗争中性格的发展走自己的道路、做自己要做的事、说自己要说的话。作者只是忙于在向观众交代“重要的问题”、“政策”，企图在一部影片中阐明过多的“问题”，而忘记了艺术的基本特征是通过描绘人、描写人物性格的成长来反映生活。
    我们正在进行着的伟大的社会主义的改造事业，是由活生生的、有血有肉的每个具体的人来进行的，反映在银幕上的，就必然是人和人之间的性格的冲突。如果我们的影片能充分表现现实生活中正面人物为维护、支持、新生的事物而进行的斗争，以及和各种落后的人物之间的剧烈冲突，这部影片就具有了电影艺术所要求的戏剧性、赋予正面人物的鲜明的强烈的动作性、以及情节的真正引人入胜地开展。展不开这种性格之间的冲突，也无法展开生活的冲突，也就不会有什么真正的情节；正面人物也就不可能有什么真正的斗争。我们必需强调地提出：情节的引人入胜、紧张结构的严密，是一部优秀的影片不可缺少的重要因素。情节在相当大的程度内决定人物个性刻划的深度。情节是更深刻地、生动地描绘人物个性和揭示生活的冲突的剧情发展的基础。但是，我们的电影剧本却往往忽视情节。这常常是我们影片中正面人物的性格缺乏鲜明的行动性的表现，性格发展不充分的一个基本原因。高尔基指示我们：“剧情是性格的历史”，这句话，对我们今天的电影艺术有着意味深长的启示，值得我们三思。
    正面人物创造的另一个重要方面，是要正确地描绘他们在斗争、在劳动中丰富多样的精神面貌。现实斗争的尖锐、复杂化，必然引起人的性格的变化，人的思想感情的变化，人和人之间的关系的变化，这些变化使得人的内心活动、精神面貌复杂起来、丰富起来。不能深刻地挖掘人的内心世界，就不可能鲜明地全面地刻划人物的性格特征。对正面人物的精神面貌的简单的表现，把他们表现为头脑简单的人，缺乏感情生活，在斗争中缺乏激情，是对我们这个时代的英雄形象的污蔑，也是对生活的歪曲。怎么能够设想，一个对生活没有热爱、在斗争中无动于衷、没有激情的人，会为了我们的理想忘我地奋斗呢？我们有许多作品只表现了生产过程、技术、斗争过程，而没有真正表现人的思想感情；恋爱、家庭、朋友、人生中某些欢乐和悲痛，斗争中受到挫折的苦恼和激情，在作品出奇地稀少，只是聊胜于无地成为生活的点缀而已；于是作品中只剩下政治的说教和四平八稳的“正面人物”；这既不是生活，也不是艺术。
    当然这丝毫也不是像某些人所想的，所谓表现精神面貌，只是一个百分比的问题，只是生产劳动加上多少个人生活、或者加上多少思想，加多少感情的问题，更不是要去“大胆表现”正面人物面临严重考验时的“一霎那的动摇”，为了正面人物的“性格化”，去强加若干缺点在人物身上，认为正面人物也会有些反面的特征，这样，人物的性格才生动、复杂，才符合于生活的“真实”。我们要求的是把工作和生活、家庭和社会、劳动和社会活动、思想和感情等等，这些在我们日常斗争和生活中无时无刻不水乳交融在一起的真实的情形，按照人物性格的发展、剧情的发展，予以合情合理的真实的反映。
    这个问题也答复了像要不要揭发我们生活中不健康、落后现象，要不要写反面人物、要不要进行批评与自我批评诸如此类的疑问，这些正是在表现正面人物时不可能不接触的问题。难道正面人物在斗争和生活中勇于和不健康、落后的现象作斗争、勇于和反面人物进行艰巨的斗争、勇于进行批评自我批评，不恰恰就是精神面貌丰富多样的表现么？
    对于创造正面人物典型的创造的错误看法，严重地障碍着我们向社会主义现实主义前进。这个缺陷，也在导演、演员的创作中存在。导演和演员在处理角色创造人物的工作中，也往往不敢大胆突出表现人物的性格，表现人物的内在世界，表现人和人之间性格的冲突。以致我们电影艺术不能在银幕上创造出新英雄的光辉的典型，不能在千万观众激动的心头上铭刻下永远不忘的性格鲜明的形象。
    要为提高电影艺术的思想和艺术水平而斗争，其根本症结在此。
    此外，在我们和概念化、公式化的倾向作斗争的同时，我们艺术创作方面也产生某些自然主义的倾向。有些创作者对艺术表现生活的真实性有些误解；他们满足于一些生活现象的罗列，拘泥于生活的局部的、个别的现象的真实，而忽视艺术的加工，集中与概括和典型性。有些作品中缺乏创作者辛勤、认真、严肃的劳动，他们只不过照“生活中就是这样的”，把它“朴素地”搬过来只求“像生活”，而不敢在艺术创造中有任何想像和夸张，扼杀了艺术的生动活泼的创造力，使得艺术成为生产过程、技术等等条文的解释，而降低艺术的思想性和以社会主义精神教育人的巨大作用。使得艺术成为歪曲生活真实的、苍白无力的或者是肮脏的照相。这也是我们今天创作中一种危险的倾向。
    以上这些错误倾向，也同样在其他片种的创作方面表现出来。然而，创作中不论是概念化、公式化、或是某些自然主义的倾向，都是反映着一个根本问题，在于电影工作者还不熟悉生活；马克思列宁主义修养不足，还不能深刻地研究和理解生活。同时，我们各种创作者都还缺乏熟练的技巧；对技巧的锻炼、提高的认识还不够，不理解没有高度的技巧就不可能描绘如此复杂丰富的现实。深刻、复杂的思想内容，如果不能赋予适宜于电影艺术特性的手段，寻求最鲜明的最完美的电影形式，是不可能最好地完成艺术创作的任务的。
    回顾几年来电影事业的成就，展望明天，愈益感到我们的工作还远远落后于现实，落后于人民的需要；愈益感到摆在我们面前的任务是严重的，但我们有信心，在党的总路线光明的灯塔的照耀下，在社会主义现实主义的旗帜下前进，以苏联电影为我们的榜样，更加努力，克服工作中的缺点，为提高整个电影艺术的思想和艺术水平而奋斗，以期很快地创造出更多更好的无愧于人民的优秀的影片。
