    Embankment Breach Closure Projects Commence Along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province

    Embankment breach closure projects along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province have successively commenced and are estimated to be completed by November. Approximately two million mu of wheat, rapeseed, peas, and other crops can be planted in the areas along the river.

    To enable residents of disaster areas to return to their hometowns to resume production and rebuild their homes as soon as possible, the Anhui Provincial Party and government leadership organs have decided to close the breaches in the river embankments as early as possible. Since the official establishment of the Anhui Provincial Yangtze River Breach Closure Project Command on September 20th, the Wuhu and Anqing Special Districts, as well as Wuhu City and An Ding Street in Wuwei County, a key project area, have also successively established breach closure project commands. After surveying each breach, some projects have rapidly commenced. Currently, the An Ding Street Command has prepared more than 4.3 million jin of reeds and branches, excavated 4,500 cubic meters of stone, and transported 4,250 canvas tents, and dispatched 15 steamers and 7,800 tons of wooden boats. This breach closure project is estimated to be completed in early November. A series of preparatory works have also been carried out for the breach closure project along the river in Anqing Special District. Dongliu and Huaining counties have prepared more than 32,000 fir timbers, 1.26 million jin of Mao bamboo, 840,000 jin of firewood and grass, and a large number of galvanized wires, and have also organized 400 large and small wooden boats to transport materials. The Guanzhuang Embankment in Tongling County commenced work on September 26th, mobilizing more than 1,700 laborers. By the 10th, five breaches had been closed.

    为了使灾区居民提早回乡生产、重建家园，安徽省党政领导机关决定及早堵塞江堤决口。从九月二十日安徽省长江堵口工程指挥部正式成立后，芜湖、安庆两专区及芜湖市和重点工程无为县安定街也相继设立了堵口工程指挥部。各个决口勘测完毕后，部分工程迅速开工。现安定街指挥部已经备好芦柴、树枝四百三十多万斤，已开石方四千五百公方，并运到帆布篷四千二百五十个，调度轮船十五艘、木船七千八百多吨。这一堵口工程估计十一月上旬即可完工。安庆专区沿江的堵口工程也已进行了一系列的准备工作。东流、怀宁两县已准备好杉木三万二千多根、毛竹一百二十六万斤、柴草八十四万斤和大批铅丝，还组织了大小木船四百只运送器材。铜陵县官庄圩在九月二十六日开工，动员民工一千七百多人，到十日止已堵好溃口五处。
