Farmers from the suburbs of Beijing, scientists and artists, staff members of various organizations and groups in the capital, and students and teachers from 29 universities and colleges, including Renmin University of China, Peking University, and Tsinghua University, as well as 34 middle schools in Beijing, have also visited the exhibition. The number of people from all over the country coming to Beijing to visit this exhibition is increasing daily. Tianjin City alone has already registered over 100,000 people who want to come for group visits.

Various scientific and technological exchange activities organized by the exhibition have now begun. In the exhibition hall, Soviet experts are introducing advanced Soviet science and technology and art works to engineering and technical personnel and workers, students of the Central Meteorological College, and teachers and graduate students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, October 20th: From the 14th to the 20th, the Soviet National Folk Dance Troupe held eight consecutive performances at the open-air theater of the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Hall, entertaining workers, farmers, soldiers, students, teachers, cadres, and citizens of the capital. In these few days, more than 30,000 viewers in the capital have enjoyed the wonderful dance performances of the Soviet artists.

In addition to the excellent dance programs of various Soviet nationalities that have been performed in previous shows, many new programs have been added one after another in the past few days, such as "A Day on the Ship," which depicts the life of naval soldiers, and the comic dance drama "Football Dance." Every program performed by the dance troupe has been warmly welcomed by the audience. Programs such as "Potato Dance," "Football Dance," and "Kazan Tatar Dance" have been performed again and again in many performances due to audience requests.

These dances are full of youthful vitality, optimistic emotions, and are also very humorous. They gave the audience a strong infection.

In the past few days, many Chinese dancers and young dance workers have been present at each performance of the dance troupe to observe and learn. The mature performances of the dance troupe's artists and their artistic style of promoting folk art traditions and being loyal to the people's lives have also left a deep impression on Chinese artists.

The Soviet artists have shown great enthusiasm for performing dances for the Chinese people. Although they have intense rehearsals every morning, in order to meet more Chinese audiences, they performed two shows each day on the 19th and 20th.

    苏联民间舞蹈团连续演出招待各界观众
      【新华社二十一日讯】二十天来，到北京苏联展览馆参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的，已达一百万零五千人。
    参观展览会的各方面的观众中，人数最多的是首都各厂矿工人，他们大约在十万以上。北京郊区农民，科学家和艺术家，首都各机关团体工作人员，中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学等二十九个高等学校和北京市三十四个中学的学生和教师，也已经参观过了这个展览会。全国各地远道来京参观这个展览会的人日益增多。仅天津市已经登记要来集体参观的就有十多万人。
    展览会举办的各项科学技术交流工作现已开始。在展览馆中，苏联专家正分别向工程技术人员和工人、中央气象专科学校学员、中央美术学院教员和研究生等，介绍苏联先进的科学技术和美术作品。
   【新华社二十日讯】从十四日到二十日，苏联国立民间舞蹈团连续在北京苏联展览馆露天剧场举行了八次演出，招待首都的工人、农民、战士、学生、教员、干部、市民。这几天，首都有三万多观众欣赏了苏联艺术家们的精彩的舞蹈表演。
    这几天舞蹈团演出的，除了以前几次演过的苏联各民族的优秀的舞蹈节目外，还先后增加过许多新的节目，如描写海军战士生活的“舰上的一日”和滑稽舞剧“足球舞”等。舞蹈团演出的每一个节目，都受到观众的热烈欢迎。“马铃薯舞”、“足球舞”、“喀山鞑靼人舞”等节目，都曾在不少场演出中，因观众的要求，演了一次又一次。
    这些舞蹈充满了青春的活力，乐观的情绪，又非常有风趣。它们给了观众以强烈的感染。
    这几天，舞蹈团每一次演出时，都有我国的许多舞蹈家和年青舞蹈工作者到场观摩学习。舞蹈团艺术家们的成熟的表演和他们发扬民间艺术传统、忠于人民生活的艺术作风，也给我国艺术家们留下深刻的印象。
    苏联艺术家们对于为中国人民演出舞蹈表现了极大的热情，虽然他们每天上午进行紧张的排练，但为了能够多和中国的观众见面，十九日和二十日两天，每一天下午都接连演出两场。
