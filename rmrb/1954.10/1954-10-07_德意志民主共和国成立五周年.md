Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the German Democratic Republic
Dr. Lothar Bolz, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic

October 7, 1949, is the birthday of the first truly democratic and peace-loving country in German history – the German Democratic Republic. Under the leadership of the German working class and its party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the anti-fascist democratic forces in Germany closely formed a democratic alliance and established this fortress to fight for a unified, peace-loving, independent, and democratic Germany. The great leader Stalin, forever remembered by progressive humanity, called the founding of the German Democratic Republic a turning point in European history in his historically significant congratulatory telegram.

Restoring Germany's unity, concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and withdrawing all foreign occupying forces are the main desires of all peace-loving and patriotic Germans. The German Democratic Republic points out the path to them and gives them the strength to achieve this great national goal. The German Democratic Republic has set an example for all Germans of the future unified Germany. In this unified Germany, the German people will be the dominant force.

The rapid development of the German Democratic Republic after the implementation of land reform, industrial reform, judicial reform, administrative reform, and cultural reform, the continuous improvement of people's lives, the extensive social welfare facilities enjoyed by working people and their families, and the educational opportunities for them and their children, all guarantee that the people live a peaceful, happy, prosperous, and wealthy life, and inspire them to make greater achievements in peaceful construction. The example of the German Democratic Republic also shows the people of West Germany how great achievements can be made by a country where workers and peasants are the masters and by people who have been liberated from capitalist oppression and exploitation.

In order to support the struggle of all German patriots for the reconstruction of German unity, the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic have successively put forward 53 proposals on restoring national unity and accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with the whole of Germany. The momentum of the resolute struggle of the people of the German Democratic Republic and the broad masses of the people of West Germany against the Bonn and Paris war treaties – which aim to revive militarism in West Germany and piece together an American aggressive alliance system in Europe with West Germany as the core – is growing, making it increasingly difficult for the current Bonn rulers to refuse the consultation proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic.

In terms of international relations, the German Democratic Republic belongs to the world peace camp and is willing to establish diplomatic relations with any country – regardless of its internal system – on the basis of the democratic principles of equality, mutual respect, and non-aggression of sovereignty, and to conclude trade agreements and accords in the spirit of mutual benefit.

The government of the German Democratic Republic particularly supports the Soviet Union's proposal for a pan-European treaty on the establishment of a European collective security system, and is prepared to contribute its share to this collective security system. Such a collective security treaty would effectively prevent the danger of war in Europe and help restore Germany's unity on a peaceful and democratic basis.

The German Democratic Republic is not isolated in its struggle. It is united with all peace forces in the world, especially with the leader of the world peace camp – the powerful Soviet Union and the most populous and most important country in Asia – the People's Republic of China, as well as all other people's democratic countries. Since the founding of the German Democratic Republic, these sincere friends have given it fraternal support and decisive assistance. At various international conferences, representatives of the peace camp countries have consistently and resolutely advocated the restoration of Germany's national unity, demanding that it be given sovereignty and that it be able to continue to develop peacefully and democratically. In this way, they have shown their full trust in the peace-loving forces of the German people. The Soviet government's statement of March 26 this year on establishing relations with the German Democratic Republic like those with other sovereign states also demonstrates this point. According to this statement, the German Democratic Republic has obtained the freedom to decide its internal and external affairs – including issues related to relations with West Germany – independently.

The extensive political, economic, and cultural relations between the German Democratic Republic and the countries of the peace camp are based on a common policy of advocating peace and national friendship. This policy imposes a lofty obligation on the German Democratic Republic to defend and develop this friendly relationship as if it were protecting its own eyes.

The friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China is embodied in the various agreements signed between the two governments. The People's Republic of China is the second largest trading partner of the German Democratic Republic, second only to the Soviet Union. Based on the needs of both sides and the principle of mutual benefit, the two countries have concluded annual trade agreements and reached agreements on the exchange of goods between the two countries. Experts from the German Democratic Republic participated in the installation of machinery and equipment imported from the German Democratic Republic in the People's Republic of China and helped with production. The Sino-German Technical and Technical Science Cooperation Agreement signed in 1953 stipulates the exchange of scientific and technical experiences between our two countries, which has a very favorable effect on the economic development of the two countries.

Extensive cultural exchanges are of great significance in enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and German people. This exchange not only aroused great interest among the people of the German Democratic Republic, but they also eagerly hope to learn more and more thoroughly about the lives of the Chinese people, to understand their thousands of years of high culture, and the large-scale peaceful construction cause in recent years. The Chinese performing arts troupes and acrobatic troupes – which are just one aspect of the diverse cultural exchanges – have quickly won the praise and love of German audiences during their visits and performances in the German Democratic Republic, and their outstanding artistic achievements have been heartily welcomed by the people of the German Democratic Republic.

The friendly visit of Dr. Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, to Berlin after the close of the Geneva Conference, was a great and glorious event for the German people. The people of the German Democratic Republic have watched with boundless respect the tireless and victorious struggle waged by the outstanding statesman of the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference, and have seen with satisfaction the fact that Mao Zedong's country – the People's Republic of China – has gained its due great power status and is committed to easing tensions in international relations. The German people are very grateful for the efforts made by the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference, which so effectively supported the Soviet Union's struggle for a peaceful and democratic solution to the vital problems of the German nation. The statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Grotewohl after their talks is the guideline for the future diplomatic relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China. This statement advocates resolutely continuing to implement a policy of peace, not tolerating foreign interference in their national sovereignty, opposing the rearmament of West Germany and Japan, strengthening and developing economic and cultural relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China, and supporting the desire of the West German people to lift the one-sided economic ties dependent on the interests of American monopoly capital and expand trade with the People's Republic of China. For the benefit of the people of the German Democratic Republic and China and world peace, the German Democratic Republic will do its utmost to realize the content of this statement.

    德意志民主共和国成立五周年
    德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部部长  洛·博尔茨博士
    一九四九年十月七日，是德国人民历史上第一个真正民主与爱好和平的国家——德意志民主共和国的诞生日。德国反法西斯民主力量在德国工人阶级及其政党德国统一社会党的领导之下紧密地结成了民主联盟，建立了这个为争取统一、爱好和平与独立、民主的德国而斗争的堡垒。进步人类永远怀念的伟大领袖斯大林在他的具有历史意义的贺电中把德意志民主共和国的成立称作欧洲历史的转折点。
    恢复德国的统一、缔结对德和约以及撤退所有的外国占领军队，是一切爱好和平和热爱祖国的德国人的主要愿望。德意志民主共和国向他们指出了道路，并给予他们以达到这个伟大的民族目标的力量。德意志民主共和国为所有德国人树立了未来的统一的德国的榜样。在这个统一的德国中，占统治地位的将是德国人民。
    德意志民主共和国在实行了土地制度改革、工业改革、司法改革、行政改革和文化改革以后的飞跃发展，人民生活的不断提高，劳动人民及其家庭所享受的广泛的社会福利设施，他们和他们子女受教育的可能性等，都保证人民过着和平、幸福和繁荣富裕的生活，鼓舞他们在和平建设事业中作出更大的成绩。德意志民主共和国的榜样也向西德人民说明，工农做了主人的国家和从资本主义压迫剥削下解放出来的人们，能够获得多么巨大的成就。
    为了支持全德国爱国者为重建德国统一而进行的斗争，德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府曾先后五十三次提出了关于恢复国家统一和加速与全德缔结和约的建议。德意志民主共和国人民和西德广大人民反对波恩与巴黎战争条约——这些条约的目的是使军国主义在西德重新抬头，并拼凑一个以西德为核心的美国在欧洲的侵略同盟体系——的坚决斗争的声势日益浩大，因而使得现在的波恩执政者日益感到更加难以拒绝德意志民主共和国所提出的协商建议。
    在国际关系方面，德意志民主共和国属于世界和平阵营，并愿意同任何一个国家——不论它的内部制度如何——在平等、互相尊重和互不侵犯主权的民主原则的基础上建立邦交，以及本着互利的精神缔结贸易协议和协定。
    德意志民主共和国政府特别支持苏联所提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议，并且准备在这个集体安全的体系中尽自己的一份力量。这样一个集体安全的条约将能有效地防止欧洲发生战争的危险，并有助于在和平民主的基础上恢复德国的统一。
    德意志民主共和国在斗争中并不是孤立的。它和世界上所有的和平力量团结在一起，特别是和世界和平阵营的领导者——强大的苏联和地球上人口最多、亚洲最重要的国家——中华人民共和国有着亲密的关系，和所有其他人民民主国家也是如此。这些真诚的朋友们自从德意志民主共和国成立以来给了它以兄弟般的支持和决定性的帮助。在各种国际会议上，和平阵营国家的代表一贯坚决主张恢复德国的全国统一，要求给予它以主权和使它能够和平民主地继续发展。这样，他们就表明了自己对于德国人民爱好和平力量的充分信任。苏联政府今年三月二十六日关于和德意志民主共和国建立像与其他主权国家一样的关系的声明，也表明了这一点。根据这个声明，德意志民主共和国获得了可以自行决定它的内部和对外事务——包括与西德的关系问题在内的自由。
    德意志民主共和国在政治、经济和文化方面与和平阵营各国之间的广泛的关系，是建立在主张和平与民族友好的共同政策的基础之上的。这种政策使德意志民主共和国担负起崇高的义务，要像保护自己的眼珠一样来捍卫和发展这种友好关系。
    德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间的友谊，在两国政府签订的各种不同的协定中体现了出来。中华人民共和国是德意志民主共和国在贸易额上仅次于苏联的第二个国家。根据双方的需要和互利的原则，两国缔结了逐年的贸易协定，达成了在两国之间交换货物的协议。德意志民主共和国的专家在中华人民共和国参加了由德意志民主共和国输入的机器设备的安装工作，并帮助进行生产。一九五三年签订的德中技术与技术科学合作协定规定在我们两国之间进行科学与技术的经验交流，这对两国经济的发展有着极有利的作用。
    广泛的文化交流对于增进中德两国人民之间的友谊具有重大意义。这种交流不但使德意志民主共和国人民感到极大的兴趣，而且他们也迫切地希望更多、更彻底地了解中国人民的生活，了解他们几千年来的高度文化，和近年来大规模的和平建设事业。中国的文工团和杂技团——这只是多种多样的文化交流中的一项——在德意志民主共和国的访问演出，迅速地博得了德国观众的赞扬和喜爱，他们的杰出的艺术成就受到了德意志民主共和国人民的衷心欢迎。
    中华人民共和国总理兼外交部部长周恩来博士在日内瓦会议闭幕后在柏林进行的友好访问，对于德国人民是一件极为光荣的大喜事。德意志民主共和国人民曾怀着无限的敬意注视中华人民共和国杰出的政治家在日内瓦会议上所作的不懈的胜利的斗争，并且怀着满意的心情看到了毛泽东的国家——中华人民共和国已经获得了它应有的大国地位，并致力于缓和国际关系中的紧张局势的事实。德国人民十分感激中华人民共和国在日内瓦会议上所作的努力，这种努力是如此有效地支持了苏联为和平民主地解决德意志民族切身问题而作的斗争。周恩来总理和格罗提渥总理在会谈后发表的声明是德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国今后外交关系的准绳。这个声明主张坚决继续贯彻和平政策，不容忍外国干涉它们本国的主权，反对重新武装西德和日本，加强和发展德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间的经济和文化关系，支持西德人民要求解除依附美国垄断资本利益的片面经济联系和扩大对中华人民共和国的贸易的愿望。德意志民主共和国为了德中两国人民和世界和平的利益，将以全力来实现这个声明的内容。
