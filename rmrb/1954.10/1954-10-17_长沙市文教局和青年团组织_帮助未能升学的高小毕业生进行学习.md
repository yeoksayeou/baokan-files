    Changsha Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League of China have organized and assisted more than 3,700 primary school graduates who failed to enter higher education this year to enter cultural refresher schools, cultural refresher classes, and establish self-study groups for learning.
    Students participating in cultural refresher schools and refresher classes study language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, geography, and other courses for 24 hours a week. Students are able to study with peace of mind and conscientiously. Students generally reflect that some language and mathematics problems that they did not fully understand in elementary school have gradually become clear after remedial study, and their understanding is also deeper. Long Lizhong, a student at Changsha Private Wenxiang Refresher Class, said: "I did not pass the entrance exam to junior high school. When I first came to the refresher class, I felt very embarrassed. When I met my elementary school teachers and classmates who passed the junior high school entrance exam on the street, I pretended not to see them. After being educated by the Young Pioneers, I realized that going to junior high school and cultural refresher classes are both ways to improve cultural and scientific knowledge and prepare to participate in socialist construction in the future. I have now settled down and am working hard to study."
    In addition to remedial courses, students in cultural refresher schools and refresher classes sometimes organize evening parties, music, dance, and outings, and other recreational activities. The Changsha Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League are planning to organize them to visit factories and have discussions with workers and farmers to cultivate their correct labor concepts.
    More than 2,400 primary school graduates who did not participate in cultural refresher schools and refresher classes are quite eager to organize self-study groups. The Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League is actively organizing and helping them to participate in self-study groups. Four self-study guidance groups have been established in the four districts of the city to be responsible for specifically guiding the work of the self-study groups. Thirteen self-study groups have been officially established in the city, with more than 130 students participating. The students are in high spirits for learning. While studying on their own, they also help with household labor. Among the self-study groups, junior high school graduates from the community in the district who meet certain conditions are selected to serve as study tutors, or junior high school graduates participating in the self-study group are asked to help tutor.
    The Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League is carrying out various preparatory tasks and is actively striving to expand the thirteen self-study groups in the city to 240 self-study groups around October 20, so that all primary school graduates who have not entered school can participate in learning in self-study groups.

    长沙市文教局和青年团组织
    帮助未能升学的高小毕业生进行学习
    湖南省长沙市文教局和青年团长沙市委会，已组织和帮助今年未能升学的三千七百多名高小毕业生，分别进入文化补习学校、文化补习班和成立自学小组进行学习。
    参加文化补习学校和文化补习班的学生们，每周补习二十四小时的语文、数学、物理、化学、历史、地理等课程，学生们都能安心和认真学习。学生们普遍反映：过去在小学时没有完全弄懂的一些语文和数学上的问题，经过补习以后渐渐弄懂了，认识也较深刻了。长沙市私立文翔补习班学生龙立中说：“我没有考上初中，初来补习班学习的时候，感到很不好意思，在街上碰到小学时候的老师和考上初中的同学，装做没有看见他们，经过少年先锋队的教育，我认识到上初中和文化补习班都是提高文化和科学知识，准备将来参加社会主义建设，我现在已安心下来，努力学习。”
    文化补习学校和补习班的学生们，除补习课程外，有时还组织晚会、音乐，舞蹈和郊游等文娱活动。长沙市文教局和青年团长沙市委会正计划组织他们参观工厂，同工人、农民座谈，以培养他们的正确的劳动观点。
    未参加文化补习学校和文化补习班的二千四百多高小毕业生，对组织自学小组的要求相当迫切。青年团长沙市委会，正积极组织和帮助他们参加自学小组学习，现已在市区的四个区成立了四个自学指导小组，负责具体指导自学小组的工作。全市已正式成立十三个自学小组，参加的学生一百三十余人，学生们学习情绪比较高，他们一面自学，一面帮助家里劳动。在自学小组中，选拔本区社会青年中具有一定条件的初中毕业生担任学习辅导员，或由参加自学小组中的初中毕业生帮助辅导。
    青年团长沙市委会，正进行各项准备工作，积极争取在十月二十日左右由全市的十三个自学小组发展到二百四十个自学小组，以便使全部未进入学校的高小毕业生能参加自学小组里学习。
