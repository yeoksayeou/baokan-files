    The People's Government of Shahekou District in Lüda City, Liaoning Province, established a system for receiving people's representatives after the conclusion of grassroots elections. Since the implementation of this system, the connection between the government and the masses has become even closer. In the first half of this year, the district received more than seventy people's representatives, who conveyed 183 opinions to the government. The government has paid close attention to these opinions. For example, after a people's representative reported that a certain staff member's life was corrupt and degenerate, the district people's government immediately took action after an investigation confirmed the report. When a people's representative reflected that the district people's court's handling of cases did not take into account the production of workers, the court changed the handling of cases involving workers to Sundays.
    The work of the Shahekou District People's Government in receiving people's representatives is directly managed by the Head of the Civil Affairs Section. A reception room has also been specifically set up, and it is stipulated that the time for regularly receiving people's representatives is from Monday to Friday mornings. If some representatives do not have time during the day, they can also notify the district people's government by telephone in advance so that someone can be retained to receive them in the evening. During the reception, the receptionist records the situation reflected by the people's representative in detail as a basis for research and handling. Within a certain period, the district people's government also holds forums for people's representatives to report on the government's reception work and solicit their opinions for improvement.

    旅大市沙河口区人民政府定期接见人民代表
    基层选举工作结束后，辽宁省旅大市沙河口区人民政府就建立了接待人民代表的制度。自实行这一制度以来，政府和群众的联系进一步密切了。今年上半年，该区共接待了七十余名人民代表，他们向政府反映了一百八十三条意见。这些意见，政府都很重视。如人民代表检举了某工作人员生活腐化堕落，区人民政府在调查属实后，立即进行了处理。当人民代表反映区人民法院处理案件，未照顾工人的生产时，法院便把有关工人的案件改在星期天处理。
    沙河口区人民政府接待人民代表的工作是由民政科长直接负责的。并且特地设立了接待室，规定每星期一至星期五的上午为经常接待人民代表的时间。有些代表如果白天没有时间，也可事先用电话通知区人民政府，以便留人在晚间接待。接待时，接待者都将人民代表所反映的情况详细记录下来，作为研究处理的依据。在一定时期内，区人民政府还分别举行人民代表座谈会，向他们报告政府接待工作的情况，并征求他们的改进意见。
