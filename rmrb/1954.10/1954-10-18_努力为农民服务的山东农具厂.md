Shandong Farm Implement Factory Strives to Serve Farmers
Huang Yuan

With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shandong's rural areas, farmers are in urgent need of new-style farm implements. At the beginning of this year, the higher authorities designated the Shandong Farm Implement Factory to specialize in the manufacture of double-wheeled, double-furrow plows and repeatedly increased production targets. The workers and cadres of the Shandong Farm Implement Factory were all extremely excited, considering it a great honor to accept this task. However, how had the more than one thousand double-wheeled, double-furrow plows produced in the past been used by the farmers? What opinions did they have? Everyone was uncertain. If the old plows were not suitable, and the factory continued to produce them in the same old way, wouldn't that affect farmers' production? This problem should be resolved quickly.

Under the assistance and guidance of the higher authorities, the Shandong Farm Implement Factory contacted the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Provincial Cooperative General Office and convened a forum of users to widely solicit farmers' opinions. A total of eighteen suggestions for improvement were put forward at the forum. After research and analysis, the factory formulated an improvement plan, and the workers completed it all in one month. The farmers said: The flat iron plow handles are not good, they cut the hands when used, and they should be changed to round ones. After research, the factory considered that round ones would also not be suitable, and it would be best to make them oval, so they were changed to oval. The farmers said: The flat iron of the drawbar (where the livestock are tied) is too thin and easily twisted. The factory thickened the drawbar. The farmers said: The plowshares produced by the factory are different. The good ones still work well after plowing a hundred mu of land and become sharper as they plow, but the bad ones become dull after only thirty mu. The factory added a hardness testing machine and stipulated that double-wheeled, double-furrow plowshares that do not meet the hardness standard cannot leave the factory, ensuring that each plow can plow more than one hundred mu at its first use (dull plowshares can be re-forged and reused). This overcomes the previous shortcoming of only relying on experience to check the hardness of plowshares, which was not precise enough. The farmers said: The tail wheel of the plow is too long and hits the legs when plowing. The factory felt that it should be shortened to make it more convenient to use and save materials, so it was changed. The farmers said: This plowshare is made of wrought iron, which is very good, but it is difficult to buy replacements when it is damaged. It would be best to include two more with each plow for replacement. The factory also followed this suggestion.

The production of double-wheeled, double-furrow plows is increasing. The factory felt that it should regularly solicit farmers' opinions, on the one hand to continue to improve quality, and on the other hand to accumulate technical data as a basis for improving product quality. However, what is the appropriate way to do this? Holding meetings? It is inconvenient for farmers to come from the countryside to the city. Going down to solicit opinions? This can only be done with a focus. Therefore, they plan to include a questionnaire with each double-wheeled, double-furrow plow, so that farmers can simply write their opinions on the questionnaire and mail it back after use.

It is necessary to ensure that every part meets the specifications so that every double-wheeled, double-furrow plow that goes to the farmers is of good quality. When the factory's administrative department assigns monthly tasks, it always puts quality first and formulates quality standards and inspection specifications. In the past, when inspectors found substandard products, some workers would say: Farm implements are "rough work," a little difference doesn't matter, and they would disagree with scrapping them, and the two sides would often argue. Now such arguments no longer occur. When inspectors find that products do not meet the specifications, the workers either study the reasons with the inspectors or say: "Scrap this one, and learn a lesson next time." Dai Zhongjing of the tool workshop carefully checks every tool. From January to July, he manufactured more than thirty kinds of hundreds of tools of different sizes, all of which met the quality standards. Wang Yufa, the leader of the pressure group, always carefully checks the processed parts transferred from the previous process with a template first, picks out the unqualified ones, and checks them again after processing to prevent substandard products from being mixed into the qualified products. In July, only eight pieces were scrapped out of the sixteen types and more than 28,000 parts processed by their group. Thanks to the workers' efforts, the scrap rate gradually decreased.

The strict requirements for quality are not only reflected in the treatment of current products but also in the treatment of past products. In February, the hardness testing machine was installed, but many plowshares had already been installed. At this time, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China at the Shandong Farm Implement Factory made a resolution: In order to be responsible to the farmers and implement the administrative instructions, the plowshares that had been installed before the hardness testing machine was installed should be removed and retested. Individual administrative cadres felt it was troublesome, but the Party General Branch conducted education and criticism, and finally, each one was removed and retested.

The workers' emphasis on quality has resulted in good feedback from the farmers: The plows from the Shandong Farm Implement Factory are getting better and better!

The workers also pay attention to reducing costs. In May, the hunchback pressure group in the material cutting section made two mistakes in cutting materials in a row, and the workers in the group were very distressed. Because the farmers said when they came to the factory to visit: This plow is good, but it is a bit expensive, and ordinary peasant brothers cannot afford it. This is a request for the factory to reduce costs. But how can costs be reduced if you are so careless and make mistakes in cutting materials? How can we explain this to our peasant brothers? From then on, the whole group actively improved their work, and there was no more incorrect cutting of materials in June and July. The factory cost of each double-wheeled, double-furrow plow in January and February was more than 1.308 million yuan, but by July it had been reduced to more than 864,000 yuan.

The mutual aid and cooperation movement in the countryside is booming. Many agricultural producers' cooperatives write letters to the farm implement factory saying: We are in urgent need of your double-wheeled, double-furrow plows to increase grain production and jointly build socialism...

The factory's production tasks are getting heavier and heavier, increasing from 450 units per month to 1,000 units, 1,500 units, and 1,700 units. The workers and staff studied Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, put forward the slogan of not wasting a minute of production time, improved many tools and operating methods, and production is advancing rapidly. To make a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow, it took 56.488 work hours in January, but by July it had been reduced to 24.339 work hours; 450 units were produced in January, and 1,726 units were produced in July.

By the end of July this year, the factory had manufactured more than 6,000 double-wheeled, double-furrow plows. These new-style farm implements have become a good helper for farmers to increase production and have promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

The Xing Xiyou Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xingjia Shuimo Village, Fifth District, Junan County, compared the crops grown on a 19th-grade secondary land plowed with a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow and fertilized with 2,000 jin of manure per mu with the crops grown on a 26th-grade yellow soil plowed with an old plow and fertilized with 2,800 jin of manure per mu. The whole township commented: The field plowed with the old plow, despite the good soil and more fertilizer, was plowed shallowly and yielded forty jin less grain than the field plowed with the double-wheeled, double-furrow plow.

Many farmers, seeing that the double-wheeled, double-furrow plow plows quickly and well but that they cannot afford it, actively request to join agricultural producers' cooperatives. Many mutual aid groups are also preparing conditions, preparing to transform into agricultural producers' cooperatives after the autumn harvest and buy more double-wheeled, double-furrow plows.

Shandong has 88 million mu of land that can be plowed with double-wheeled, double-furrow plows. If each mu increases production by 10%, it can increase grain production by 1.32 billion jin per year. In order to help farmers increase grain production, the Shandong Farm Implement Factory will begin to expand from next year. When the expansion plan is completed, it will be able to produce 60,000 good and cheap double-wheeled, double-furrow plows every year.

    努力为农民服务的山东农具厂
    黄远
    随着山东农村中互助合作运动的发展，农民们迫切需要新式农具。今年年初，上级确定山东农具厂专事制造双轮双铧犁，而且一再地增加生产任务。山东农具厂的工人和干部都异常兴奋，认为能够接受这个任务是很大的光荣。可是，过去已经生产了一千多部双轮双铧犁，农民使用得怎么样？有些什么意见？大家都心中无数。如果过去的犁不合适，厂里还照老样子生产，那不是会影响农民的生产吗？这个问题是应该很快得到解决的。
    山东农具厂在上级的协助和指导下，和省农林厅、省合作总社联系，召开了用户座谈会，广泛地征求农民的意见。座谈会上一共提出了十八条改进的意见。厂里作了研究分析，制订了改进计划，工人们就在一个月中全部把它实现了。农民们说：犁把扁铁的不好，使起来割手，应该改成圆的。厂里研究的结果，认为圆的使起来也不合适，最好是椭圆形的，就改成椭圆形的。农民们说：拉杆（系牲口的地方）的扁铁薄了些，很容易扭弯。厂里就加厚了拉杆。农民们说：厂里出的犁铧不一样，好的耕了一百来亩地还是好样的，而且越耕越锋锐，可是不好的只耕三十来亩就磨钝了。厂里就增加了一部硬度检验机，并规定双轮双铧犁的硬度不达标准不能出厂，保证每张犁第一次都能耕一百亩以上
  （犁铧磨钝还可以打出再用）。这就克服了过去只凭经验检查犁铧硬度，以致不够精确的缺点。农民们说：犁的尾轮太长了，耕起来碰腿。厂里觉得应该搞短，使起来方便，又节省料，就改了。农民们说：这个犁铧是熟铁的，虽然很好，但坏了不好买，最好每部再带上两块，替换着使。厂里也照办了。
    双轮双铧犁的生产越来越多了，厂里觉得应该经常地征求农民的意见，一方面继续改进质量，另方面积累技术资料，作为改进产品质量的依据。可是，怎样做才合适呢？开会吧，农民从农村到城市来不方便，下去征求意见吧，只能是有重点的。于是，他们打算在每部双轮双铧犁上带上一张征求意见书，农民使用后只要把意见写在意见书上寄来就行了。
    必须保证每一个零件都合乎规格，才能使每一部到农民手里去的双轮双铧犁都是好样的。工厂的行政方面布置每月的任务时，总是把质量放在第一位，而且制订了质量标准和检验规范。过去，检验员检查出不合规格的产品时，有的工人就说：农具是“粗拉活”，差点不要紧，不同意报废，双方经常吵起架来。现在这样的吵架再也没有了。当检验员发现产品不合规格时，工人们不是和检验员研究原因，就是说：“这个报废吧，下次接受教训。”工具车间的戴仲敬对每一个工具都认真检查，从一月到七月，他制造了三十多种几百个大小不同的工具，全部合乎质量标准。压力小组的组长王玉发，当上道工序转来了加工零件后，总是先仔细地用样板检查一遍，把不合格的挑出来，加工完后，再检查一遍，不使不合规格的产品混入合格品里。七月份，他们小组加工的十六种、两万八千多个零件中，仅有八件报废。由于工人们的努力，废品率逐渐降低。
    对于质量要求的严格，不但表现在对待现在的产品是这样，而且表现在对于以往的产品也是这样。二月份，硬度检验机安装起来了，可是有许多犁铧早已安装上了。这时，中共山东农具厂总支委员会作了决议：为了对农民负责和贯彻行政的指示，应该把硬度机没有安装起来以前就安装上的犁铧拆下来重新检验。个别行政干部觉得麻烦，党总支进行了教育和开展了批评，终于逐部拆下来重新检验了。
    工人们重视质量的结果，得到了农民们的良好反映：山东农具厂的犁越出越好！
    工人们也很注意降低成本。在五月里，下料工段的驼背压力小组，接连下错了两次料，小组里的工人们非常心痛。因为农民们来厂参观时说：这犁好是好，就是贵了些，一般农民弟兄买不起。这就是要求工厂降低成本。但这样粗心大意把料下错，怎么能降低成本呢？那能向农民弟兄交代呢？从此以后，全组都积极改进工作，六、七两个月再也没有发生下错料的情况。山东农具厂每部双轮双铧犁一、二月份的工厂成本是一百三十万八千多元，到七月份已经降低到八十六万四千多元了。
    农村中互助合作运动蓬勃发展起来了，不少的农业生产合作社写信给农具厂说：我们迫切需要你们出的双轮双铧犁，好增产粮食，共同建设社会主义……。
    厂里的生产任务越来越重了，由月产四百五十部提高到一千部、一千五百部、一千七百部。职工们学习了王崇伦的革新精神，提出了不浪费生产时间
  一分钟的行动口号，改进了许多工具和操作方法，生产日新月异地前进着。做一部双轮双铧犁，一月份是五十六点四八八个工时，七月份已经减少到二十四点三三九个工时了；一月份出了四百五十部，七月份出了一千七百二十六部。
    到今年七月底止，全厂已经制造了六千多部双轮双铧犁。这些新式农具成了农民们增产的好帮手，并且推动了互助合作运动的发展。
    莒南县五区邢家水磨村邢西友农业生产合作社，把一块用双轮双铧犁耕的、每亩施了二千斤粪的、十九级的二性土地里长的庄稼，跟用旧犁耕的、每亩施了二千八百斤粪的、二十六级的黄土地里长的庄稼作比，全乡的评论是：旧犁耕的那块，别看地好粪多，但耕得浅，比双轮双铧犁耕的那块要少打四十斤粮。
    许多农民看到双轮双铧犁耕得又快又好，但自己买不起，就积极要求加入农业生产合作社。许多互助组也在准备条件，准备秋后转为农业生产合作社，多买双轮双铧犁。
    山东有八千八百万亩可以使用双轮双铧犁耕种的土地，如果每亩增产百分之十，每年就可增产十三亿二千万斤粮食。为了帮助农民增产粮食，山东农具厂从明年开始，就要扩建了，等扩建计划完成的时候，它每年就可生产六万部又好又便宜的双轮双铧犁。
