Fujian Province Farmers Enthusiastically Sell Surplus Grain to Support the Liberation of Taiwan

    By October 5th, farmers in Fujian Province had sold over 520 million jin of rice to the state, exceeding the state's original early and mid-season rice procurement plan by 35.93 percent.

    Fujian Province's early rice production reached its highest level in history this year, and mid-season rice also had a bumper harvest. Since July, with the harvesting of early rice, a wave of selling grain swept across the province from south to north. At grain purchasing stations in various places, thousands of farmers sold their surplus grain collectively from morning to night every day. Farmers selected the best grain to sell to the state, and many farmers' grain sold to the state had been sunned three times and winnowed four times. Farmers in Guanling Town, Lianjiang County, picked up the rice that had been dried and stored the day before selling the grain, and dried it again on the threshing ground. Young farmer Chen Tongguang said to everyone while turning over the rice: "Sun it dry, winnow it clean, and sell it to the state so that the worker elders can eat well and produce more machines to build our country."

    After the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan by various democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China was announced, and the victory news of the People's Liberation Army's bombardment of Jinmen and the crushing blows against Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' planes kept coming, farmers in Fujian became even more enthusiastic about selling grain. Farmers in many places put forward the slogan of "Selling more grain to the state to support the liberation of Taiwan." The members of Yang Weimei's mutual aid team in Toule Township, Jian'ou County, said during a discussion of the Joint Declaration for the Liberation of Taiwan: During the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the farmers in the Northeast contributed a lot; in order to support the liberation of Taiwan, we must sell more grain to the state. This mutual aid team has already sold more than 10,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. By September 20th, the grain sold by farmers in many areas to the state had already exceeded the state's plan for purchasing early and mid-season rice in the local area. The old revolutionary base area, Chong'an County, exceeded the plan by 73.15 percent.

    福建省农民踊跃出售余粮支援解放台湾
    到十月五日止，福建省农民卖给国家的稻谷已经有五亿二千多万斤，超过国家原订早稻、中稻收购计划百分之三十五点九三。
    福建省今年早稻产量达到历史上最高水平，中稻也获得丰收。从七月份起，随着早稻的收割，全省由南到北掀起了卖粮的热潮。各地粮食收购站里，每天从早到晚有成千成百的农民集体出卖余粮。农民们选择最好的粮食卖给国家，许多农民卖给国家的粮食经过了三晒四扬。连江县官岭镇农民在出卖粮食的前一天，又把已经晒干收藏起来的稻谷挑到晒谷场上重晒一遍。青年农民陈统光一边翻晒稻谷，一边对大家说：“晒得干干的，扬得净净的，卖给国家，让工人老大哥吃好，制造更多的机器建设我们国家。”
    中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言公布以后，解放军炮轰金门和痛击蒋贼飞机的胜利消息不断传来，福建各地农民卖粮更为踊跃。许多地方的农民都提出了“多卖粮食给国家，支援解放台湾”的口号。建瓯县头乐乡杨为美互助组的组员们在讨论解放台湾联合宣言时说：抗美援朝的运动中，东北农民出力特别多；为了支援解放台湾，我们一定要多卖粮食给国家。这个互助组已经把一万多斤余粮卖给国家。到九月二十日止，许多地区的农民卖给国家的粮食，就已经超过了国家在当地收购早稻、中稻的计划，革命老根据地——崇安县超过计划百分之七十三点一五。
