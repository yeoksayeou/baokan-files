    Major workshops of China's First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, centered around the general assembly workshop—carpentry shop, auxiliary workshop, chassis workshop (i.e., the workshop where the general assembly workshop is located), forging shop, non-ferrous metal casting workshop, model workshop, and a thermal power plant—have been completed one after another. Currently, workers in these workshops are actively installing various industrial pipelines and electromechanical equipment. Machinery and equipment manufactured with Soviet assistance are being continuously transported to the construction site.
    The thermal power plant, one of the main power sources for the entire factory, has already installed all the main and auxiliary machines of the No. 1 boiler, and completed the furnace wall on the 25th, preparing to start baking the furnace. This winter and next spring, it will provide power and heat to construction and installation workers and production workshop employees. In the auxiliary workshop, the machine repair, tool and other workshops that are planned to be put into production first according to the construction plan, had installed several hundred machine tools by the 24th. In the carpentry shop, where construction was completed first, in addition to a batch of machine tools being installed, the complete set of equipment for the thirty-two carpentry drying rooms to be used for drying automobile bodies will soon be installed. The electrical installation project for the power trunk line of the carpentry shop and the power distribution line of the auxiliary workshop, and the first batch of industrial pipeline installation projects of the carpentry shop are also underway. In each workshop of the six basic production workshops that have been completed—carpentry shop, auxiliary workshop, chassis shop, forging shop, non-ferrous metal casting workshop, and model workshop—dozens of overhead cranes have been installed, some of which are already in operation. They are helping installation workers unload batches of bulky machines.

    第一汽车厂主要厂房建成并积极安装设备
    我国第一汽车制造厂以总装配车间为中心的六座厂房——木工场、辅助工场、底盘工场（即总装配车间所在的厂房）、锻工场、有色金属铸件工场、模型工场和一座热电站，已相继落成。目前在这批厂房里，工人们正积极进行安装各种工业管道和机电设备工作。苏联帮助我国制造的机器设备正源源地运到工地。
    全厂主要动力之一的热电站，已经安装好第一号锅炉的全部主机和附机，并在二十五日砌完炉墙，准备开始烘炉，今冬明春将给建筑安装工人和生产车间的职工带来动力和热。在辅助工场，按照建厂计划准备最先投入生产的机修、工具等车间，到二十四日止，已经安装好机床几百台。在建筑工程最先完工的木工场里，除了有一批机床正在安装外，将来烘干汽车车身用的三十二间木工干燥室的全套设备快要安装完毕。木工场动力干线和辅助工场动力配线的电气安装工程、木工场的第一批工业管道安装工程也正在进行中。在六个已经建成的基本生产厂房——木工场、辅助工场、底盘工场、锻工场、有色金属铸件工场、模型工场的各个车间内，已经安装好几十台天车，其中有的已经运行了。它们正帮助安装工人卸下成批的笨重机器。
