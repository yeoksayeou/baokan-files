    Hunan State-Owned Commercial Departments Revise Fourth Quarter Purchasing and Sales Plan
    The Commercial Department of the Hunan Provincial People's Government convened a provincial commercial work conference from October 15th to 23rd, focusing on discussing the tasks of the state-owned commercial departments in Hunan Province for the fourth quarter of this year, and re-formulating the purchasing and sales plan for the fourth quarter. Although some areas of Hunan Province suffered from flooding this year, most rural areas still reaped bumper harvests of rice, miscellaneous grains, and various local and special products. In the fourth quarter, efforts should be made to actively purchase agricultural and sideline products and vigorously supply industrial products to meet the needs of farmers. The conference determined that the sales task of state-owned commercial departments in the fourth quarter should increase by 40 percent compared to the actual sales performance of the same period last year. The conference also criticized the conservative thinking of some cadres who are not actively expanding the sales of industrial products and organizing the large-scale distribution of industrial products to rural areas.

    湖南国营商业部门修订第四季度购销计划
    湖南省人民政府商业厅在十月十五日至二十三日召开全省商业工作会议，着重讨论了湖南省国营商业部门在今年第四季度的任务，并重新制订第四季度的购销计划。湖南省今年部分地区遭到水灾，但大部分农村的稻谷、杂粮，各种土产、特产品仍获得丰收。第四季度应该积极收购农副产品和大力供应工业品，以满足农民需要。会议确定第四季度国营商业部门的商品销售任务比去年同期商品销售实绩增加百分之四十。会议并批判了目前有些干部不积极去全力扩大工业品推销和大量组织工业品下乡等保守思想。　（新华社）
