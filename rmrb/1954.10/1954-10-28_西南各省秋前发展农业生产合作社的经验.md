    Experiences in Developing Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Southwestern Provinces Before Autumn
    Zhang Jiaqi
    The southwestern provinces plan to develop agricultural production cooperatives to 30,000 by the spring plowing of 1955, with more than 100 townships basically collectivized. Since mid-June, Sichuan has closely combined summer production with the launch of the first batch of cooperative establishment work, and Guizhou and Xikang also successively launched the first batch of cooperative establishment work in July. By the end of August, a number of cooperatives had been established. The work of establishing cooperatives in Yunnan also began in September. The number of cooperatives established this time is much larger than in the past, forming a mass movement in many places; much experience has been gained in implementing the mass line.

    According to the experience of Sichuan and other places, establishing a batch of cooperatives in the summer is more beneficial to agricultural production and the development of the cooperatives under the specific conditions of the southwest. The benefits of doing so are: it can avoid the trouble of dealing with small spring crops; it can plan the next year's small spring crops in a unified way according to the needs of the state and the conditions of the cooperatives; it can organize winter farmland capital construction, fertilizer accumulation and sideline production, and give full preparation for spring plowing; at the same time, it can enable county and district leaders to free up their hands after autumn to concentrate their efforts on the unified purchase and sale of grain and cotton. The possible difficulty is that establishing a large number of new cooperatives will disperse forces and affect the consolidation of old cooperatives and summer production. However, facts have proved that as long as the leadership arranges well and is good at using the agricultural slack period before autumn, not only can the above-mentioned difficulties be overcome, but also the establishment of cooperatives can directly promote summer production. Of course, it is inappropriate to establish too many cooperatives in the summer or to complete the annual task of establishing cooperatives in the summer, regardless of subjective and objective conditions and possibilities.

    Judging from the situation of establishing cooperatives before autumn in Sichuan, Guizhou and other regions, training a large number of backbone personnel for running cooperatives is an important link to ensure the establishment of good cooperatives. According to the training plans of various provinces, about 300,000 backbone personnel for running cooperatives will be trained in the whole region before winter. The trainees include county and district cadres, but mainly township party and league branch secretaries, village cadres, mutual aid team leaders, etc. This year's training of backbone personnel has the following characteristics: First, each newly established cooperative has five or six backbone personnel to study (including those who may become the head and deputy head of the cooperative, production team leader, technician, and women's backbone personnel), and they have been cultivated into a leading core in the training process, who can undertake the task of establishing cooperatives and have initially developed independent working ability and democratic style. This can not only overcome the difficulty of insufficient leadership, but also effectively avoid the substitution of county and district cadres. Second, in selecting training objects, the method of combining mass deliberation and recommendation with leadership review is adopted, so that the trained backbone personnel basically have the conditions of being active, fair, and capable, and are supported by the masses. Third, in addition to the general mutual aid and cooperation policies, the party's class policy in rural areas is particularly emphasized in the training content, and communist and basic knowledge education of the Communist Party is combined to develop party members through the actual test of establishing cooperatives, establish and strengthen the party's grassroots organizations, and enable the work of establishing cooperatives to be carried out under the leadership of the branch from the beginning. Fourth, in addition to using the two resolutions of the central government on mutual aid and cooperation as teaching materials, we focus on local materials, systematically summarize the experience of pilot cooperatives in this region in the past, and combine it with the current situation. This method is not only easy for the masses to accept, but also further enriches the leading cadres.

    The new situation in establishing cooperatives this year is that the number is large and the distribution is wide, and the leadership strength is not adapted to the situation of great development. Therefore, the method of sending a few cadres to run a cooperative in the past must be changed. In this regard, various places have gained some initial experience: First, it is necessary to mobilize the whole party, under the unified leadership of the county party committee, district party committee and branch, all relevant departments should closely cooperate, mobilize the broad masses, form a mass movement of establishing cooperatives, and organically combine various tasks with the work of establishing cooperatives. Sichuan Province established more than 1,100 credit cooperatives in conjunction with the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, and Suining Prefecture developed 3,000 party members in the process of establishing cooperatives. The work of establishing cooperatives in various places has also promoted the unified purchase of wheat. Second, leading cadres should directly grasp the key points, take the first step, and summarize the experience; at the beginning of each stage of work, a meeting of representatives should be held (temporarily convened when necessary) to introduce the key experiences and specifically arrange the next step of work. The Suining County Party Committee proposed "the leadership touches the key points, grasps the key points in stages, and promotes from point to surface through the meeting of representatives"; the county set up a command headquarters, and the county party committee divided the work. This can timely discover problems, exchange experiences, and correct deviations, and the effect is very good. Wanxian County in Sichuan and Jinning County in Yunnan nominated and recommended objects for establishing cooperatives through mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings and township people's representative meetings, and the leading authorities reviewed and approved them. This not only satisfies the masses, but also avoids "spontaneous cooperatives" and points out the direction for mutual aid teams that are not yet qualified. Some places take the cooperatives with a better foundation as the central cooperative and establish a joint cooperative, which has unified leadership in work and independent accounting in economy. The adoption of this form is beneficial in strengthening leadership, exchanging experiences, and necessary unified action and mutual support in production; at the same time, it also helps to break the sectarian concepts of mutual suspicion and antagonism between cooperatives in some places, and cultivate farmers' habits of accepting unified leadership and carrying out collective management, creating favorable conditions for gradually running large cooperatives in the future. Third, in terms of the steps of establishing cooperatives, the size of the cooperatives, and the distribution of regions, it is necessary to not only proceed from the current conditions, but also take into account the needs of the next batch of cooperative establishment and the future comprehensive collectivization. Within a township or village, a unified plan and specific arrangements should be made for the development of cooperatives; in terms of regions, they should be developed in pieces and blocks to avoid random insertion of flowers. For the activists in the villages or resident groups who are not prepared to establish cooperatives in this batch or even the next batch, they should be persuaded to remain in the mutual aid teams, lead the mutual aid teams well, and prepare for establishing cooperatives in the future. When running the first batch of cooperatives, cadres and mutual aid team leaders who will run the second batch of cooperatives should be organized to participate in running the cooperatives in a planned way. This not only strengthens the strength of the first batch of cooperatives, but also trains cadres on the spot. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the regular leadership of mutual aid teams to create conditions for continuous cooperative establishment in the future. The content of mutual aid teams' activities should be gradually enriched, such as running sideline businesses, renting public land, building water conservancy projects, trying out piecework wages, developing joint mutual aid, etc. Practice has proved that joint mutual aid is a better reserve form for cooperative establishment. It can exchange experience, train cadres, provide necessary mutual support in production, give play to greater collective strength, such as carrying out capital construction on a larger area of land and promoting advanced technology, using new agricultural tools and water pumps, accumulating certain public property, reasonably regulating labor force, solving certain contradictions in grabbing work and grabbing time, etc., and can strengthen the unity between groups, gradually cultivate farmers' habits of collective labor and collective management, and create conditions for establishing cooperatives. However, attention must be paid to preventing blindly merging large groups without regard to specific conditions and production needs, doing everything collectively, forcing orders, so as to affect production and unity.

    Although the work of establishing cooperatives before autumn this year has been relatively smooth and the development is generally normal, there are still some shortcomings and problems:

    First, the ideological mobilization in some places is relatively rough, and the farmers' awareness and the influence of the old cooperatives have been overestimated, and they are satisfied with the farmers' application and are confused by the enthusiasm of a few activists. Therefore, they are blindly optimistic and make a lot of noise, relaxing the arduous ideological work. A few cadres mistakenly believe that: "The task is large, complete voluntariness is impossible, as long as 70 or 80 percent of voluntariness is achieved, it is basically voluntary." "To join the cooperative as a whole family, only the voting method of the minority obeying the majority can be used." Some mechanically use the method of pouring out grievances during the land reform, and believe that it is deeply mobilized only when crying. However, because they do not understand the principles of running a cooperative and the benefits of the cooperative, some farmers are still unwilling to join the cooperative even though they cry. A few places have also seen simple, crude and coercive styles. Without analyzing some farmers' concerns or dissatisfaction, they think that they are "spreading rumors" and "sabotaging", and even "chasing thoughts" and "investigating motives", randomly slapping hats such as "small-peasant economy does not accept transformation" and "serious spontaneous forces". A few activists quarrel with their families and break up because of joining the cooperative, losing social sympathy. Some are eager to deal with specific problems when the members' thoughts are not clear, resulting in dissatisfaction or even withdrawal from the cooperative. According to the inspection of Neijiang Prefecture, 12 percent of the cooperatives have many problems, and 20 percent of the members' ideological mobilization is not good enough. Although these are local phenomena, and various places have already made up for them, they are still worth vigilance in the future.

    Second, although there has been significant progress in implementing the party's class line, the thinking of the party committees above the general county is relatively clear; however, some cadres still cannot make a unified and comprehensive understanding of the party's class line. On the one hand, the tendency to think that poor peasants are backward, not actively cultivating poor peasant backbones, not relying on poor peasants, and discriminating against poor peasants has not been completely corrected; on the other hand, the phenomenon of excluding and infringing upon the interests of middle peasants has occurred again; some places have proposed "cultivating poor peasant backbones to replace middle peasant leadership", as if middle peasants cannot be backbones. An individual county party secretary also said, "Move out those wavering middle peasants." When Feng Shicai Cooperative in Nanmu Township, Southern District, evaluated land production and shareholding, it stipulated that middle peasants would be exempt from production under 30 jin, and poor peasants would be added to production under 30 jin. Some cooperatives adopted methods such as converting plowing cattle into public ownership at a price, and bringing fertilizer and plowing cattle farming equipment funds with the land from the beginning, which not only increased the difficulties of poor peasants, but also caused dissatisfaction among middle peasants. Some places are not vigilant enough about the destruction of rich peasants. These shortcomings and mistakes have created some rifts between middle and poor peasants in some places, giving the enemy an opportunity to sabotage, and also need to be vigilant and prevented in the future.

    Third, some places are not clear about the ideas of "carrying out an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation" and the mutual promotion of production, supply and marketing, and credit cooperatives, so they grasped this end and lost that end, and relaxed the leadership of overall production increase and mutual aid teams. Some only look at this step, regardless of the next step, and are unwilling to carry out arduous ideological mobilization work, "randomly order soldiers", concentrate good activists and more conscious farmers to run cooperatives, and exclude some farmers with lower consciousness and some small problems in their thinking and style. As a result, cooperatives are established, mutual aid teams are dismantled, individual farmers are increased, production is affected, and difficulties are created for future comprehensive collectivization.

    After the work of establishing cooperatives before autumn was generally completed, party committees at all levels held meetings to make inspections and summaries, so as to earnestly accept these experiences and lessons in the large-scale cooperative establishment after autumn.

    西南各省秋前发展农业生产合作社的经验
    张家骐
    西南各省计划在一九五五年春耕前发展农业生产合作社到三万个，有一百多个乡要基本上合作化。自六月中旬起，四川各地即紧密结合夏季生产先后展开第一批建社工作，贵州和西康第一批建社工作亦于七月份相继展开，至八月底已建起一批。云南的建社工作也已在九月间开始。这次建社数量比过去大得多，在不少地方形成了群众性的运动；在贯彻群众路线方面得到了不少经验。
    根据四川等地经验证明，在西南的具体条件下，夏季建一批社对农业生产和社的发展都比较有利。这样做的好处是：可以避免处理小春作物的麻烦；可以按国家需要和社的条件来统一计划下年度的小春作物；可以组织冬季的田土基本建设、积肥和副业生产，给春耕作充分的准备；同时可以使县区领导方面在秋后能腾出手来集中力量进行粮棉的统购统销工作。可能发生的困难是因建立大批新社而分散力量，影响老社的巩固工作和夏季生产。但事实证明，只要领导安排得好，善于利用秋前的一段农事空隙，不仅可以克服上述困难，而且可以通过建社直接推动夏季生产。当然，如果不顾主观客观的条件和可能，夏季建社过多或把全年的建社任务都放到夏季来完成，那是不妥当的。
    从四川、贵州等地区秋前建社情况看，训练好大批的办社骨干，是保证建好社的重要一环。根据各省训练计划，冬季前全区训练约三十万名办社骨干。受训练的，除县区干部外，主要是乡党团支部书记、乡村干部、互助组长等。今年训练骨干有这样几个特点：一、每个新建社都有五、六个骨干来学习（包括可能做正副社长、生产队长、技术员的人和妇女骨干），在训练过程中就培养他们形成了领导核心，能把建社的任务担当起来，初步养成了独立工作能力和民主作风。这样，既可以克服领导力量不足的困难，又可以有效地避免县区干部的包办代替。二、在选择训练对象的时候，运用了群众酝酿推荐和领导审查相结合的方式，使受训的骨干基本上具备了积极、公道、能干的条件，并为群众所拥护。三、训练内容除一般的互助合作政策外，各地特别强调了党在农村的阶级政策，并结合进行共产主义和共产党的基本知识教育，以便通过建社的实际考验发展党员，建立和加强党的基层组织，并且使建社工作一开始就在支部领导下进行。四、除采用中央关于互助合作的两次决议等文件做教材以外，着重就地取材，系统地总结本地区过去试办社的经验，并结合目前情况。采用这种办法，不但群众容易接受，而且使领导干部进一步充实了。
    今年建社的新情况是数量大、分布广，领导力量和大发展的形势不相适应。因此，过去采用的派几个干部办一个社的办法必须改变。这方面各地已取得一些初步经验：一、必须全党动员，在县委、区委和支部统一领导下，各有关部门密切配合，发动广大群众，形成群众性的建社运动，使各种工作和建社工作有机地结合起来。四川省结合建立农业生产合作社新建起一千一百多个信用合作社，遂宁专区在建社中发展党员三千人。各地的建社工作，也推动了小麦的统购工作。二、由领导干部直接掌握重点，先走一步，总结出经验来；每段工作开始时召开代表会（必要时临时召集），介绍重点经验，具体安排下一步工作。遂宁县委提出“领导摸重点，分段抓关键、通过代表会，由点推到面”；县设指挥部，县委分片包干。这样做，可以及时发现问题、交流经验、纠正偏差，效果很好。四川万县、云南晋宁等县，通过互助合作代表会和乡人民代表会议进行互助组排队，提名推荐建社对象，由领导方面审查批准。这样做，不但群众满意，而且避免了“自发社”，给还不够条件的互助组指出了努力的方向。有的地方把基础较好的社作为中心社，建立联社，工作上统一领导，经济上独立核算。采用这种形式，在加强领导、交流经验及生产上必要的统一行动和互相支援等方面都有好处；同时，也有助于打破某些地方社和社之间互相猜忌对立的宗派观念，培养农民接受统一领导、进行集体经营的习惯，为将来逐步办大社创造了有利条件。三、在建社的步骤、社的大小、地区分布等方面，不仅要从当前的条件出发，而且要照顾到下一批建社和将来全面合作化的需要。在一乡一村内，对社的发展要作统一的规划和具体安排；在地区上，要成片成块发展，避免乱插花。对于这一批甚至下一批还不准备办社的村或居民组的积极分子，应说服他们仍留在互助组内、领导好互助组，准备将来办社。办第一批社时，即应有计划地组织第二批办社的干部互助组长参加办社。这样，既加强了第一批社的办社力量，又实地训练了干部。四、要加强对互助组的经常领导，为今后连续办社创造条件。要逐渐充实互助组的活动内容，如经营副业、租种公田、兴修水利、试行按件计工制、发展联组互助等。实践证明：联组互助是建社的一种较好的后备形式，它可以交流经验、培养干部，在生产上进行必要的互相支援，发挥较大的集体力量，如进行较大面积土地上的基本建设和推行先进技术，使用新式农具、抽水机，积累某些公共财产，合理调剂劳动力，解决某些抢工抢时的矛盾等等，并可以加强组和组间的团结，逐渐培养农民集体劳动、集体经营的习惯，为办社创造条件。但必须注意防止不按具体条件和生产需要而盲目地并大组，事事集体，强迫命令，以致影响生产和团结。
    今年秋前建社工作虽然进行得比较顺利，发展一般正常，但是还有一些缺点和问题：
    第一、有些地方思想发动比较粗糙，对农民的觉悟和老社的影响作了过高的估计，满足于农民申请报名，为少数积极分子的热情所迷惑，因而盲目乐观，大轰大擂，放松了艰苦的思想工作。有少数干部错误地认为：“任务大，完全自愿不可能，只要争取到百分之七、八十自愿就算基本上自愿了。”“要全家入社，只有用少数服从多数的表决办法。”有的机械搬用土地改革时的诉苦办法，并认为哭了才算发动得深入。可是，因为不明白办社的道理和社的好处，有的农民虽然哭了却仍然不愿入社。少数地方又发生了简单生硬和强迫命令作风，对农民某些顾虑或不满言行，不加分析地认为是“造谣”“破坏”，甚至“追思想”“查动机”，乱扣“小农经济不接受改造”、“自发势力严重”等帽子。少数积极分子因为入社而和家庭吵架闹分家，丧失社会同情。有的在社员思想还不通时就急于处理具体问题，结果使有些人不满甚至退社。据内江专区检查，有百分之十二的社存在较多的问题，百分之二十的社员思想发动不够好。这些虽然是局部现象，各地并且已经进行了补课，但仍值得今后警惕。
    第二、在贯彻党的阶级路线方面虽然较过去有显著的进步，一般县以上党委思想都比较明确；但是，有些干部对党的阶级路线仍不能作统一全面的理解。一方面，认为贫农落后，不积极培养贫农骨干，不依靠贫农、歧视贫农的偏向仍未完全纠正过来；另一方面，排斥和侵犯中农利益的现象又有发生；有的地方提出“培养贫农骨干代替中农领导”，仿佛中农都不能当骨干。个别县委书记也说“把那些动摇的中农动员出去”。南部楠木乡冯世才社土地评产入股时规定：中农三十斤以下产量免去，贫农三十斤以下的加上。有的社一开始就采用耕牛折价归公、随田带肥料、带耕牛农具款等办法，既增加了贫农的困难，又引起中农的不满。某些地方对富农的破坏警惕不够。这些缺点和错误在某些地方已造成了中贫农间的某些裂痕，给敌人破坏以可乘之机，也是今后必须警惕和防止的。
    第三、有些地方对于“开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动”和生产、供销、信用三种合作互相促进的思想不明确，因而抓了这头丢了那头，放松了对全面增产和互助组的领导。有的只看这一步，不顾下一步，不愿进行艰苦的思想发动工作，“乱点兵”，把好的积极分子和觉悟较高的农民都集中起来办社，把一些觉悟较低和思想作风上有些小毛病的农民剔出去，结果，办起合作社，扯垮互助组，增加了单干户，影响了生产，造成了将来全面合作化的困难。
    各级党委在秋前建社工作大体结束后，都开会作了检查总结，以便在秋后大量办社中认真接受这些经验教训。
