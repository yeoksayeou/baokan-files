    Many Large-Area, High-Yield Cotton Fields Appear in Hebei Province
    Over Two Million Mu of "Dai Character Cotton" in Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest
    With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, many large-area, high-yield cotton fields have appeared in Hebei Province this year. In Shijiazhuang Prefecture alone, there are over six thousand mu of cotton fields with yields half again higher than last year and normal years, and two to three times higher than local general cotton fields. In the second district of Wu'an County, Handan Prefecture, there is also one thousand-mu and six three-hundred-mu large cotton fields which have achieved such yields. The 1,396 mu of irrigated cotton land in the Dong Ruiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kou Village, Yuanshi County, yielded an average of 227 jin of seed cotton per mu. The average yield of more than forty hundred-mu high-yield cotton fields in Handan County was 200 jin of seed cotton per mu, while the average yield of general cotton fields in the county was only 151 jin of seed cotton per mu. Among the 1,500 mu of large-area high-yield cotton fields in the Gong Yubo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nangong County, there are also 170 mu yielding 250 jin of seed cotton per mu, and seven mu yielding 500 jin of seed cotton per mu.
    Two or three years ago, farmers in Hebei Province created many high-yield records of 500 to 600 jin of seed cotton per mu. However, due to individual production, they could not resist the invasion of natural disasters, and high yields could only be achieved in small-scale experiments. Last year, many agricultural production cooperatives with more than one hundred households were established in the cotton-growing areas of Hebei. Collective labor overcame the difficulties of insufficient manpower and animal power in cotton planting, overcame insect and drought disasters, and improved cotton planting technology. As a result, many large-area high-yield cotton fields have appeared this year.

    The 2,320,000 mu of "Dai Character Cotton" in Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, has begun to be picked, and it is estimated that the yield per unit area can exceed the yield of local cotton varieties by more than two times. The "Dai Character Cotton" in the entire prefecture, including newly reclaimed land and cotton fields rescued from waterlogging, is estimated to yield an average of about 49 jin of ginned cotton per mu, close to last year's bumper harvest level, and in most old cotton-growing areas, it can exceed last year's. Other cotton varieties can only yield an average of about 16 jin per mu. Now farmers throughout the prefecture are paying attention to selecting and retaining good seeds during cotton harvesting, planning to further promote and expand the planting area of ​​"Dai Character Cotton" next year, and preparing to transfer some to other places for promotion.
    Nantong Prefecture is one of the main cotton-producing areas in Jiangsu Province, and its cotton output accounts for about one-third of the province's total output. This year, the planting area of ​​"Dai Character Cotton" accounts for about 70 percent of the cotton fields in the entire prefecture.

    河北省出现许多大面积高额丰产棉田
    江苏省南通专区二百多万亩“岱字棉”可望丰收
    随着互助合作运动的发展，河北省今年出现许多大面积高额丰产棉田。仅石家庄一个专区，比去年和常年产量高一半、比当地一般棉田增产两三成的棉田就有六千多亩。邯郸专区武安县二区也有一处千亩以上、六处三百亩以上的大片棉田达到了这样的收成。元氏县叩村董瑞泉农业生产合作社的一千三百九十六亩水浇地棉花，平均每亩产籽棉二百二十七斤；邯郸县四十多处百亩以上丰产棉田的平均产量是每亩收花二百斤，而这个县一般棉田平均产量每亩才收花一百五十一斤。南宫县巩玉波农业生产合作社的一千五百亩大片丰产棉田当中，还有一百七十亩每亩产籽棉二百五十斤，七亩每亩产籽棉五百斤。
    河北省农民在两三年前就创造了许多产籽棉五、六百斤的高额产量纪录。但由于个体生产，抵抗不了自然灾害的侵袭，高额产量只能是小面积的试验。去年，河北棉区建立了不少百户以上的农业生产合作社，集体劳动，克服了植棉当中人力和畜力不足的困难，战胜了虫旱灾害，并提高了植棉技术，因而今年出现了许多大面积丰产棉田。

    江苏省南通专区二百三十二万亩“岱字棉”已开始摘花，估计单位面积产量能超出当地棉种的产量两倍以上。全专区“岱字棉”包括新垦田和一度受涝救出的棉田在内，估计每亩平均能收皮棉四十九斤左右，接近去年丰收水平，在老棉区多数可以超过去年。其他棉种平均每亩只能收十六斤左右。现在全专区各地农民在收棉中注意选留良种，计划明年进一步推广和扩大“岱字棉”栽种面积，并准备一部分调运外地推广。
    南通专区是江苏省主要产棉地区之一，棉花产量占全省总产量三分之一左右。今年“岱字棉”种植面积占全专区棉田的百分之七十左右。
