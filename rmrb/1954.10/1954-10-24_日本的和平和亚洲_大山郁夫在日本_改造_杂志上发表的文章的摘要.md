Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd – A prominent Japanese peace activist, Oyama Ikuo, published an article titled "Japan's Peace and Asia" in the October issue of the Japanese magazine "Kaizo."

    The article begins by introducing Japan's peace movement and the current international situation. It states that this year's Japanese peace movement has seen rapid and significant development, reflecting a very notable global phenomenon. Over the past year, in the fierce struggle between peace forces and war forces worldwide, the peace forces have achieved considerable victories, with the Indochina armistice being a clear example. Under such a global situation, the rapid development of the Japanese peace movement is also inevitable. The article points out that Japan's peace movement is not only an international movement but also a patriotic movement of the broad masses of the Japanese people. As Japan's dependence on American imperialism deepens, the Japanese people cannot but consider Japan's political independence and the economic independence deeply related to it. Therefore, the importance of trade and commerce with neighboring countries—especially economic and cultural exchanges with China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian nations—is increasingly felt urgently. This understanding is held not only by Japanese workers, farmers, and fishermen, not only by intellectuals and cultural figures, but also by small and medium-sized enterprises and ordinary capitalists, excluding a tiny minority of monopoly capitalists.

    The article points out that while the world warmly welcomed the Indochina armistice, the attitude of the American authorities was completely the opposite and expressed open dissatisfaction, which is not without reason. Firstly, the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, in the eyes of the American government, is a direct conflict with the fundamental policy of using Asians to fight Asians to maintain American interests in Asia. Secondly, the United States is very unwilling to see the greatest contributions made by the Soviet Union and China at the Geneva Conference. Therefore, any activities related to this are considered to violate the will of the United States.

    The article points out that the international status of the People's Republic of China has been steadily rising and consolidating. The article states that we should value the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence put forward during the meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, because these five principles are not only the most appropriate and trustworthy principles but also fully express the long-cherished wish and hope of all Asians for peace. From these five principles, we can derive the principle that "Asians must never kill each other," the principle that "foreign military bases in Asia should be completely returned to their own people," the principle that "foreign troops in Asia should be withdrawn immediately," and the principle that "the people of Asian countries must never participate in military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Pacific Pact Organization, which are essentially divisive to Asia."

    The article concludes by saying that we must strive wholeheartedly for Japan's independence and freedom and for peace in Asia, based on these Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, participate in the construction of a lasting world peace, and contribute to the happiness of all mankind.

    日本的和平和亚洲
    ——大山郁夫在日本“改造”杂志上发表的文章的摘要
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：日本著名和平人士大山郁夫在日本十月号“改造”杂志上，发表了一篇以“日本的和平和亚洲”为题的文章。
    文章首先介绍了日本的和平运动和目前的国际形势。文章说：今年的日本和平运动有了迅速的飞跃的发展，它是反映了一个非常显著的世界的现象。一年以来，在全世界和平力量和战争势力之间的严重斗争中，和平力量已获得了很大的胜利，印度支那的停战就是一个很明显的例证。在这样的世界形势下，日本和平运动的飞跃发展也是必然的事情。文章指出：日本的和平运动，不仅是一个国际性的运动，同时还是日本广大人民的一个爱国运动，由于日本对美帝国主义势力的从属关系日益加深，日本人民不能不考虑到日本的政治独立以及和此有深刻关系的经济独立，因此要求和邻国通商贸易——特别是对于日中、日苏以及同其他亚洲国家的经济交流、文化交流的重要性，日益感到迫切。具有这种认识的人，不仅有日本的工人、农民、渔民，不仅有知识分子和文化界的人士，而且还包括日本的中小企业以及除了极少数的独占资本家以外的一般资本家。
    文章指出：在全世界热烈欢迎印度支那停战的时候，美国当局的态度却完全相反，并且表示了露骨的不满，这不是没有原因的。因为，第一，印度支那问题的和平解决，在美国政府看来，是对为了保持美国在亚洲的利益而采取以亚洲人打亚洲人的根本政策的正面冲突；其次，美国非常不愿意看到苏联、中国在日内瓦会议所作的最大贡献，因此任何有关这方面的活动，都被认为违反了美国的意志。
    文章指出了中华人民共和国的国际地位已经日益提高和巩固。文章说：我们应当重视周恩来总理和印度总理、缅甸总理会谈中所提出的和平共处的五项原则，因为这五项原则不仅是最妥当、最足凭信的原则，而且完全表现了所有亚洲人要求和平的夙愿和希望。从这五项原则就可以得出“亚洲人决不相互残杀”的原则，得出“在亚洲的外国军事基地应当完全交还本国人”的原则，得出“在亚洲的外国军队应当立即撤退”的原则，得出“亚洲各国人民决不参加本质上是分裂亚洲的所谓东南亚条约组织、太平洋公约组织等军事集团”的原则。
    文章最后说：我们要在这一和平共处的五项原则的基础之上，为了日本的独立和自由，为了亚洲的和平而全力奋斗，参加持久的世界和平的建设事业，为全人类的幸福作出贡献。
