A Record of the Capital People's Rally Welcoming Prime Minister Nehru
　　Our Staff Reporter

　　It was a clear autumn afternoon, and Zhongshan Park in the capital was decorated as if for a festival. In front of the music hall hung the national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India. Upon entering, a huge dark green banner with white characters (in Chinese and Hindi) reading "Long Live Peace!" "Long Live Sino-Indian Friendship!" attracted people's attention. Inside the music hall, melodious Chinese and Indian songs played continuously. More than 20,000 workers, students, and government employees had gathered in the park long ago, waiting for the arrival of the distinguished guest, Prime Minister Nehru.

　　At 4:30 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Peng Zhen accompanied Prime Minister Nehru and Mrs. Indira Gandhi, and other distinguished guests, arrived. They walked slowly into Zhongshan Park, passing through the welcoming crowds. A burst of applause erupted, as the people of the capital once again expressed their heartfelt welcome to Prime Minister Nehru, and their respect for the peaceful friendship of the Indian people, our neighbor. Among the welcoming crowd, the reporter met a group of female students from Beijing No. 16 Girls' Middle School, who were enthusiastically welcoming the Indian Prime Minister. Thirteen-year-old Hu Hongxing already knew quite a bit about India. She knew that India had a population of over 300 million, that India was in the tropics, and that the Indian people loved peace... She told the reporter sincerely that, for the sake of peace, she wholeheartedly welcomed Prime Minister Nehru to visit China. Yu Gengshan, a worker from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, had represented the feelings of the capital's workers at the airport to welcome Prime Minister Nehru four days ago, and today he appeared again in the welcoming ranks. He told the reporter, "We Chinese people are working hard for the socialist industrialization of our motherland. We love our country, we love peace, and we oppose wars of aggression. Some time ago, Premier Zhou went to India and jointly proposed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with Prime Minister Nehru, which we all support. Today, I am very happy to see Prime Minister Nehru again in person."

　　At 4:40 PM, the welcoming rally for Prime Minister Nehru by people from all walks of life in Beijing began. Mayor Peng Zhen, on behalf of the people of the capital, expressed a warm welcome to Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China, and also expressed the sincere desire of the Chinese people to further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between China and India. At the meeting, Prime Minister Nehru conveyed to the people of the capital the profound feelings of the Indian people for the Chinese people. He also said that he would always be grateful to the Chinese people for the friendship and love shown to him and, through him, to the Indian people. At the meeting, Mayor Peng Zhen presented gifts to Prime Minister Nehru on behalf of the people of the capital. These gifts included precious Dunhuang painting albums, albums of statues from the Maijishan Grottoes, the famous painting "Ink Shrimp" by the old Chinese painter Qi Baishi, and finely crafted cloisonné, and other arts and crafts... The most precious of these was a brocade banner embroidered with Chairman Mao Zedong's congratulatory message at the Indian National Day reception held by the Indian Embassy in China in 1951: "The Indian nation is a great nation, and the Indian people are a very good people. The friendship between the two nations and the two peoples of China and India has been very good for thousands of years.... We hope that the two nations of China and India will continue to unite and work for peace. People all over the world need peace, only a few want war. India, China, the Soviet Union, and all other peace-loving countries and peoples unite to work for peace in the Far East and for peace throughout the world..."

　　The rally ended. The sun set in the west, and twilight descended. At this time, thousands of lights in Zhongshan Park shone brightly, weaving a magnificent scene among the green trees and along the tree-lined paths. Prime Minister Nehru, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Peng Zhen, participated in a garden tour.

　　At this time, more than 20,000 people formed countless circles under the lights, singing and dancing to their hearts' content. Young people picked up accordions, erhus, and blew copper trumpets and flutes. Wherever Prime Minister Nehru went during his tour of the park, he was warmly welcomed. He stopped from time to time to watch various performances.

　　Here, Ming Jiamali, a Kazakh girl, was performing a Kazakh labor dance. Prime Minister Nehru watched her performance appreciatively and shook hands with her in greeting. Ayimujiang, a Uyghur girl, danced gracefully to the lively music of the hand drum and dutar. Members of the Young Pioneers Art Troupe performed the Li ethnic dance from Hainan Island, and young acrobats performed outstanding stunts.

　　Prime Minister Nehru and his party walked through the last section of the crowd, gathering under the "Defend Peace" archway, where people who were singing and dancing enthusiastically waved goodbye to him. At 6:30 PM, Prime Minister Nehru, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Peng Zhen, walked out of the park. At this time, the people touring the park felt infinitely excited and happy about his friendly visit, and the joyful singing and dancing continued. (Attached picture)

    记首都人民欢迎尼赫鲁总理大会
  　本报记者
    这是一个晴朗的深秋的下午，首都中山公园张灯结彩，装饰得如同迎接节日一般。音乐堂门前悬挂着中华人民共和国和印度共和国的国旗，入门，巨幅深绿底板镶着白字的标语（中文和印地文）“和平万岁！”“中印友好万岁！”吸引着人们的视线，音乐堂里不断传出了悠扬的中国歌曲和印度歌曲。两万多名工人、学生、机关干部，早就聚集在公园里等候着贵宾尼赫鲁总理的光临。
    四时三十分，周恩来总理和彭真市长陪同着尼赫鲁总理和英迪拉·甘地夫人等贵宾到了。他们徐步走入中山公园，穿过夹道欢迎的人群，一时掌声四起，首都人民再一次对尼赫鲁总理表示了他们的衷心的欢迎，表示了我国人民对邻邦印度人民的和平的友谊的敬意。记者在欢迎的人群中遇到了北京市第十六女中的一群女学生，她们是多么热情地欢迎着印度的总理。十三岁的胡红星，她已经懂得了不少关于印度的知识，她知道印度有三万万以上的人口，印度在热带，印度的人民爱好和平……。她亲切地告诉记者，为了和平，她衷心地欢迎尼赫鲁总理前来我国访问。石景山钢铁厂的工人于更山，他在四天前曾代表首都工人们的心意到机场迎接了尼赫鲁总理，今天又出现在欢迎的行列里了。他向记者说：“我们中国人民正在为祖国的社会主义工业化而奋斗着。我们热爱祖国，热爱和平；反对侵略战争。前些时，周总理到印度去和尼赫鲁总理一同提出了各国和平共处的五项原则，我们都拥护。今天，我能再次亲眼看到尼赫鲁总理，我真有说不尽的高兴啊。”
    四时四十分，北京市各界人民欢迎尼赫鲁总理大会开始了。彭真市长代表首都人民对尼赫鲁总理的来我国访问表示热烈的欢迎，并且也表达了中国人民促进中印两国友好合作关系进一步发展的真诚愿望。尼赫鲁总理在会上向首都人民传达了印度人民对中国人民的深厚的感情。他并且说，他将永远感激中国人民对他以及通过他向印度人民所表示的友谊和热爱。会上，彭真市长代表首都人民向尼赫鲁总理献礼。在这些礼品中有着珍贵的敦煌画册、麦积山石窟塑像画册、我国老画家齐白石的“中堂水墨虾”名画和景泰蓝等精制工艺品……，其中最珍贵的是一面锦旗，上面绣着毛泽东主席在一九五一年印度驻我国大使馆举行的印度国庆招待会上的祝词：“印度民族是伟大的民族，印度人民是很好的人民。中国、印度这两个民族和两国人民之间的友谊，几千年来是很好的……。我们希望中国和印度两个民族继续团结起来，为和平而努力。全世界人民都需要和平，只有少数人要战争。印度、中国、苏联及其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结起来，为远东的和平、为全世界的和平而努力……。”
    大会结束了。夕阳西下，暮色降临。这时，中山公园内成千盏灯火大放光明，在绿树丛中，林荫道上，交织成一幅瑰丽的景色。尼赫鲁总理在周恩来总理和彭真市长的陪同下参加了游园。
    这时，两万多人在灯光下围成无数个圆圈，尽情地歌舞。年青人拉起了手风琴、二胡，吹起了铜喇叭和笛子。尼赫鲁总理在园内游览时，每到一处，都受到热烈的欢迎。他不时停下来，观看各种表演。
      这里哈萨克族的姑娘明佳玛莉正在表演着哈萨克的劳动舞，尼赫鲁总理赞赏地观看了她的表演，并和她握手致意。维吾尔族的姑娘阿依木江在手鼓和都他尔的轻快的乐声中婆娑起舞，少年文工团员们演出海南岛的黎族舞，年青的杂技演员表演着出色的绝技。
    尼赫鲁总理等一行走过最后一段人群聚集的场所，在“保卫和平”牌坊下，聚集着尽情歌舞的人们，热情地向他欢呼告别。六时三十分，尼赫鲁总理由周恩来总理和彭真市长陪同步出公园。这时，游园的人们为他的友好访问而感到无限的兴奋和愉快，欢乐的歌舞仍在继续进行。（附图片）
