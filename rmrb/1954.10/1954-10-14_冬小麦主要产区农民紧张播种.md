Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Since late September, farmers in the major winter wheat producing areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Huai River basin have started sowing wheat one after another. Currently, in Shaanxi Province, except for the southern mountainous areas where sowing is still underway, the northern and Guanzhong areas have basically completed sowing, and the wheat seedlings have emerged and are growing well. According to statistics from Shanxi Province on October 9, over 13 million mu have been sown, accounting for nearly 80% of the planned sowing area. According to statistics from Hebei Province on October 7, 17.81 million mu have been sown, accounting for 56.3% of the planned sowing area. In early October, Henan Province had sown 46.2 million mu, accounting for about 60% of the planned sowing area, and the emergence of early sown crops is good. By the end of September, most areas of Shandong Province had sown about 50%. In northern Jiangsu Province, Ganyu, Donghai, Guanyun, Huaiyin, Siyang and other counties have sown 40% to 50%.

Before sowing wheat, provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Huai River basin held wheat production conferences in accordance with the spirit of the National Wheat and Oil Production Conference to formulate wheat production plans for 1955. In addition to preparing a large amount of wheat seeds, farm tools, fertilizers, and pesticides to support farmers in timely sowing, the provinces are also vigorously implementing various measures to increase production in order to improve the unit area yield of wheat. Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces have prepared a total of 392.8 million jin of high-quality wheat seeds. Henan Province requires the area of improved wheat varieties to be expanded from 23.4 million mu last year to 35 million mu this year, accounting for 45% of the total wheat sowing area. It is estimated that the promotion of improved wheat varieties in Shandong Province can reach 12 million mu, and wheat production can be increased by 200 million jin next year. In order to further promote narrow-row, uniform sowing and close planting of wheat, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces are helping farmers to modify close-planting drills and teach rocking drill technology. Most areas paid attention to preserving moisture and preventing drought during autumn plowing, and the quality of tillage and land preparation was better than in previous years.

Now is the most intensive period for sowing wheat in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Huai River basin. Party and government organs in all provinces must strengthen leadership, overcome difficulties, and ensure the timely completion of wheat sowing tasks in accordance with the national plan.

    冬小麦主要产区农民紧张播种
    【新华社十一日讯】冬小麦主要产区黄河中、下游和淮河流域，九月下旬以来农民陆续开始种麦。目前陕西省除南部山区还在紧张播种外，北部和关中地区已基本种完，麦苗出土，生长良好。山西省十月九日统计已播种一千三百多万亩，占计划播种面积近百分之八十。河北省十月七日统计已播种一千七百八十一万亩，占计划播种面积百分之五十六点三。河南省十月初已播种四千六百二十万亩，占计划播种面积百分之六十左右，播种较早的出苗情况良好。山东省九月底大部地区已播种百分之五十左右。江苏省北部赣榆、东海、灌云、淮阴、泗阳等县已播种百分之四十到五十。
    种麦前，黄河中、下游和淮河流域各省都根据全国小麦油料生产会议的精神，召开小麦生产会议，制定了一九五五年小麦生产计划。各省除准备大量麦种、农具、肥料、农药以支援农民适时种麦外，并大力贯彻各项增产措施，以提高小麦的单位面积产量。河南、山东、河北、江苏、安徽五省共准备优良麦种三亿九千二百八十万斤。河南省要求小麦良种面积由去年的二千三百四十万亩扩大到今年的三千五百万亩，占全部小麦播种面积百分之四十五。山东省推广小麦良种预计可达到一千二百万亩，明年能增产小麦二亿斤。为了进一步推广小麦的窄行匀播密植，河南、山东、山西、陕西等省都帮助农民改制密植耧和传授摇耧技术。各地在秋耕中大多注意保墒防旱，耕地整地质量比往年好。
    现在黄河中、下游和淮河流域正是种麦最紧张的时期，各省党、政机关必须加强领导，克服困难，保证按照国家计划适时完成种麦任务。
