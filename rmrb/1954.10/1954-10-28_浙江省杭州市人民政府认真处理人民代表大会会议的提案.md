The Hangzhou Municipal People's Government of Zhejiang Province Earnestly Handles Proposals from the People's Congress Meeting

During the first session of the First People's Congress of Hangzhou Municipality, the 600,000 people of the city, through their representatives, submitted 372 proposals. After discussion at the meeting, these proposals were forwarded to the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government for handling. Now, the Municipal People's Government has completed the handling of 361 proposals, and the remaining 11 are under study. Among the proposals that have been processed, 142 have achieved practical results, 108 are being resolved, and 111 cannot be resolved temporarily or can be postponed.

The Hangzhou Municipal People's Government attaches great importance to the proposals submitted by the Hangzhou Municipal People's Congress. After each proposal was sent to the relevant unit for processing, the Municipal People's Government sent special personnel to report the handling situation to the original proposing people's representatives and listened to the representatives' opinions on the handling results. Whenever the representatives were not satisfied with the original proposal's handling or put forward better handling methods, the Municipal People's Government forwarded them to the relevant units for re-study and handling. After some proposals were processed, the Municipal People's Government also sent cadres to accompany the relevant people's representatives for inspection to ensure the effective implementation of each proposal. For example, among the 209 proposals that have been processed and responded to the original proposers, 15 were not handled perfectly initially. After inspection, the Municipal People's Government has notified the relevant units to re-process them.

Among these processed proposals, the ones that have a greater impact on people's lives, such as the cleanliness of the Zhonghe River and Donghe River, were studied by the Municipal Construction Bureau and other relevant units, and appropriate temporary measures were taken before the city's sewer system problems were completely resolved. Another example is that many proposals requested the addition of bus stops. After research by the Municipal Transportation Company, eight new bus routes have been opened, providing great convenience to the residents of Shangcheng, Zhongcheng, and Xiacheng districts.

Many proposals demanded that the government strengthen the handling of illegal bourgeois elements to ensure the smooth progress of the socialist transformation of capitalist commerce; some demanded that the government strengthen the handling of theft and other cases to further maintain social order. The Hangzhou Municipal People's Court and the Hangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate have strengthened their work in these areas. Many proposals raised the issue of repairing dangerous houses. The Municipal People's Government has organized and mobilized the masses to carry out inspection and repair work; now, in Shangcheng and Xiacheng districts alone, 2,354 dangerous houses and walls have been repaired.

For some proposals that cannot be resolved temporarily or can be postponed, the Municipal People's Government has sent and will send special personnel to explain the reasons to the original proposers.

    浙江省杭州市人民政府认真处理人民代表大会会议的提案
    浙江省杭州市举行第一届人民代表大会第一次会议期间，全市六十万人民曾通过自己的代表，提出了三百七十二件提案。这些提案经会议讨论后，转交杭州市人民政府处理。现在市人民政府已将三百六十一件提案全部处理完毕，剩下的十一件也正在研究。在已处理的提案中，获得实际效果的有一百四十二件，正在进行解决的有一百零八件，暂时不能解决和可以缓办的有一百十一件。
    杭州市人民政府对杭州市人民代表大会会议交付办理的提案非常重视。每件提案发交有关单位处理后，市人民政府都派了专人向原提案的人民代表报告处理情况，听取代表们对处理结果的意见。凡代表们对原提案处理不满意或提出更好的处理办法时，市人民政府都转交各有关单位重新研究处理。有些提案处理后，市人民政府还派了干部陪同有关的人民代表进行检查，保证了每件提案的切实贯彻。如在已经处理并答覆了原提案人的二百零九件提案中，有十五件原来处理得不尽完善，经检查后，已由市人民政府通知有关单位重新处理。
    在这些已处理的提案中关系人民生活较大的如中河、东河等河道的清洁问题，经市人民政府建设局和其他有关单位研究后，在全市下水道系统的问题未彻底解决以前，采取了适当的临时措施。又如许多提案要求增设公共汽车站，经市交通公司研究后，已新开辟了八路公共汽车，给上城、中城、下城三个区的居民以很大的方便。
    许多提案是要求政府加强对不法资产阶级分子的处理，以保证对资本主义商业的社会主义改造工作的顺利进行；有些是要求政府加强对盗窃等案件的处理，以进一步维护社会秩序。杭州市人民法院和杭州市人民检察署已在这些方面加强了工作。不少提案提出了关于危险房屋的修理问题，市人民政府已组织和发动群众进行了检查和修理工作；现在，仅在上城和下城两个区已修理了危险房屋和墙头二千三百五十四处。
    有些提案暂时不能解决或可以缓办的，市人民政府已派出和即将派出专人向原提案人解释原因。
