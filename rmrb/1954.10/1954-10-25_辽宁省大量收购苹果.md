    Liaoning Province Purchases Large Quantities of Apples
    By mid-October, the state-owned food company in Liaoning Province had purchased more than 54,000 tons of various high-quality apples from all of its purchasing stations. Currently, the purchasing stations are carefully selecting and packaging the apples, and are transferring large quantities of apples to major cities to supply the people.
    In order to ensure a large supply of apples to the market this winter and next spring, the main apple-producing areas, such as Fuxian, Gaiping, and Xinjin, are mobilizing farmers to properly store apples for the country. The state is pre-paying 20% to 25% of the storage costs to help the farmers storing the apples purchase equipment.

    辽宁省大量收购苹果
    辽宁省国营食品公司各收购站，到十月中旬已收购各种优质苹果五万四千多吨。现在各收购站正在认真选果和包装，并把大量苹果调往各大城市供应人民。
    为使今冬和明春都有大量苹果供应市场，在复县、盖平、新金等主要苹果产区，正动员农民为国家储存好苹果。国家预先支付百分之二十到二十五的保管费用，给储存苹果的农民购置器材。
