As a column:

    I was laughed at when I studied painting, they said I was useless. Later, when I studied sculpture, people called me a maker of "mud Buddhas." In short, I was ridiculed and looked down upon.
    The reactionary rulers did not value culture at all, forcing many artists to change careers. Those who勉强maintained their livelihood found it difficult to create due to poverty.
    In those dark days, art was divorced from the people's lives, becoming barren and lifeless. Artists were parochial and narrow-minded, unable to create truly beneficial works.
    In the short five years since liberation, the cause of art has developed, and artworks have gained new life. In our East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, there are hundreds of teachers and students. Although the level of creation is not very high, the paintings or sculptures created by both teachers and students are taken by organizations for exhibition or publication. I often receive letters asking me, or asking me to introduce sculptors, to take on sculpture work. Now, every artist is not without subjects to use, but new people and new things appear all the time, endless to paint and sculpt; it is not that they are worried about not having sculpture or painting work, but that society needs too much, they can't finish it, they are too busy; it is not that they feel very capable, but that they can't keep up with the artistic level required by the people. Since 1950, I, a person engaged in art, have been gloriously elected as the Vice Mayor of Hangzhou City, and now I am gloriously elected as a representative to the National People's Congress. I personally am insignificant. The reason I mention myself is to illustrate that the people value any cause that is beneficial to the people, and value anyone who is willing to be loyal, honest, and wholeheartedly serve the people.
    Painters, sculptors, woodcut artists, and cartoonists, in recent years, have studied politics, transformed their old thoughts and feelings, and gone deep into life, expressing the creative labor enthusiasm of workers and peasants on the production front, the patriotic spirit of soldiers defending peace, and depicting social life, thus producing works with true, intimate content and fresh forms. Decorative artists, along with the new aesthetic viewpoints in society, have gradually changed the old vulgar decorative style. These works have been welcomed by the masses. This clear new fact has further educated us to deeply realize that: writers must first have advanced ideas in order to see clearly; art must be combined with the people's lives in order to have new life; artworks must be aimed at the needs of the people in order to be welcomed.
    In recent years, art workers have gradually changed the old artists' bourgeois ideas of being divorced from politics, divorced from life, and self-righteous. Generally speaking, they can humbly listen to the opinions of the broad masses, and writers help each other, which has accelerated the improvement of creation and the production of better works. In order for artists to accurately reflect the ever-new development and increasingly rich real life, and to improve the ideological and artistic quality of their works, in addition to their own diligent efforts, the help of the collective is indispensable. Because one person's vision is limited, it is inevitable that some places will not be seen or thought of. Without the opinions of the majority, it will be easy to lose sight of the other, and deviations will occur. I feel that the art world does not make enough use of this method of collective help; we must expand mutual assistance among writers, criticism and self-criticism, and cultivate a working life in which everyone constantly learns from each other and constantly promotes creation.
    The astonishing great victories of the motherland in the past five years, and the achievements of the new art, have encouraged artists to move forward more courageously; the experience of art in the past five years has given the cause of art and artists a clearer direction and the creative path they must take. We art workers must further improve our political consciousness, ideological level, and technical ability, and on the basis of the achievements of art in the past five years, create more excellent and inspiring artworks that meet the needs of the people.

    创作更加符合人民需要的美术品
    全国人民代表大会代表
    中国美术家协会副主席  刘开渠
    我学画时，人家笑我没用，其后我学雕塑，人家叫我做“泥菩萨”的，总之是被讥笑，被轻视。
    反动统治丝毫不重视文化，逼迫得不少的美术家改了行，勉强维持的人，也都因生活困苦，难以进行创作。
    在那种黑暗的日子里，美术脱离人民生活，贫乏无生气，美术家坐井观天，认识狭小，创作不出真正有益的作品。
    解放以来，短短的五年中，美术事业发展了，美术作品获得了新鲜的生命。我们中央美术学院华东分院，教员学生有好几百人，创作水平并不算高，但不管是教员还是学生的画或雕塑，一旦创作出来就为机关团体拿去展览或出版了。我经常接到要我或请我代为介绍雕塑家，去担任雕塑工作的信。现在，每个美术家不是没有题材可用，而是新人新事时时有，画不尽，雕不完；不是愁着没有雕塑或画画工作，而是社会上需要的太多，而是做不完，忙不过来；不是觉得能力很强，而是赶不上人民所要求达到的艺术程度了。自一九五○年起，像我这样一个搞美术的人，光荣地被选为杭州市人民政府副市长，现在又光荣地被选为全国人民代表大会代表。我个人是微不足道的，我所以提到我，是说明人民重视任何对人民有益的事业，重视任何愿为人民忠诚老实、全心全意服务的人。
    绘画、雕刻、木刻、漫画家，几年来学习政治，改造旧的思想感情，深入生活，表现工人、农民在生产战线上创造性的劳动热情，战士的爱国主义、保卫和平的英雄精神，描写社会生活，便产生了内容真实、亲切，形式新鲜的作品；装饰美术家随着社会上新的审美观点，逐渐改变旧的庸俗的装饰格调。这些作品，都受到了人民群众的欢迎。这个鲜明的新事实，更教育了我们深切地认识到：作家必须首先有先进的思想，眼睛才能亮；美术必须与人民生活结合，才能有新生命，美术作品必须针对人民的需要，才能得到欢迎。
    几年来，美术工作者逐渐改掉了旧艺术家脱离政治、脱离生活、自以为是的资产阶级思想，一般的说，都能虚心听取广大群众的意见，作家间彼此进行互相帮助，这就加速了创作的提高，获得较好作品的产生。美术家要能做到正确的反映日日有新发展，日益丰富的现实生活，提高作品的思想性和艺术性，除自己的认真努力外，集体的帮助是不可少的。因为一个人所见有限，难免有些地方见不到，想不到，如没有多数人的意见，必易顾此失彼，发生偏差。对这种集体帮助的方法，我觉得美术界利用的尚不够；必须展开作家间的互助，批评与自我批评，养成大家经常互相学习、经常互相推动创作的劳动生活。
    祖国五年来的惊人伟大胜利，新美术的成绩，鼓励了美术家更勇敢的前进；五年来美术上的经验，给美术事业和美术家更明确了方向及必须走的创作道路。我们美术工作者，要更加提高我们的政治觉悟、思想水平、技术能力，在五年的美术成绩基础上，创作更加符合人民需要的，有鼓动性的优秀美术品。
