(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 12th) TASS Moscow, October 11th: The governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Bulgaria recently discussed the work of the Soviet-Bulgarian joint-stock companies and issued a joint communiqué regarding the transfer of the Soviet shares in the various Soviet-Bulgarian joint-stock companies to the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

The communiqué stated: The Soviet-Bulgarian Shipbuilding Company, the Soviet-Bulgarian Construction Company, and the Soviet-Bulgarian Civil Aviation Company, etc., were established a few years ago according to the principle of equality in order to promote the development of Bulgarian industry and transportation sectors. Since the establishment of these companies, both sides have made substantial investments, and the Soviet Union has supplied these companies with modern equipment and necessary materials. Due to these investments and the implementation of mutually agreed upon measures, the production capacity and overall technical level of the enterprises belonging to these companies have been greatly improved. The technical assistance provided by Soviet institutions through the provision of technical data and the dispatch of experts to work in the enterprises belonging to these companies has also promoted the development of the aforementioned companies.

In view of the fact that the aforementioned companies have completed their tasks, both governments have unanimously agreed to transfer the Soviet shares in these companies to the People's Republic of Bulgaria. To this end, the two governments signed an agreement in Sofia on October 9, 1954, regarding the sale and transfer of the Soviet shares in the aforementioned Soviet-Bulgarian joint-stock companies to the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The agreement stipulates that the value of the Soviet shares will be repaid by Bulgaria over several years under preferential conditions.

The transfer of the Soviet shares in these companies to Bulgaria reflects the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Bulgaria and will further promote the strengthening of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

    苏联和保加利亚两国政府发表公报
    把苏保股份公司中的苏方股份移交给保方
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：苏联政府和保加利亚人民共和国政府最近讨论了苏保股份公司的工作，并发表了苏保关于将各个苏保股份公司中的苏联股份移交给保加利亚人民共和国的公报。
    公报说：苏保造船公司、苏保建筑公司、苏保民航公司等，是几年前为了促进保加利亚工业和运输业部门的发展而按照平等的原则建立的。自从这几个公司开办以来，双方进行了大量的投资，苏联对这些公司供应了现代化设备和必需的物资。由于进行了投资和实现了双方所协议的措施，这些公司所属各企业的生产能力和总的技术水平都大大地提高了。苏联机构通过提供技术资料、派遣专家到这些公司所属各企业进行工作等办法所给予的技术帮助，也促进了上述公司的发展。
    鉴于上述公司完成了它们的任务，双方政府一致同意将这些公司中的苏联股份移交给保加利亚人民共和国。为此，两国政府于一九五四年十月九日在索非亚签订了一项关于将上述苏保股份公司中的苏联股份出售和移交给保加利亚人民共和国的协定。协定规定，苏联股份的价值将按优惠条件由保加利亚在数年内偿还。
    把这些公司中的苏联股份移交给保加利亚，反映了苏联和保加利亚人民共和国之间的友好关系，并将促进两国之间的友谊与合作的进一步加强。
