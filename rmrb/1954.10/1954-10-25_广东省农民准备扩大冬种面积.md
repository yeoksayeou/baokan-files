Guangdong Farmers Prepare to Expand Winter Planting Area

Farmers in various parts of Guangdong Province are actively preparing for winter cultivation. According to instructions from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's South China Branch, Guangdong Province's winter cultivation planting area this year will reach 18 million mu, an increase of 7 million mu compared to last year. This will mainly focus on sweet potato production, with some wheat, oil crops, and green manure crops being planted according to local conditions. The goal is to achieve a spring grain harvest of 2 billion jin next year, an increase of 43 percent compared to last year. After the instructions were issued, they received enthusiastic support from farmers throughout the province. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have successively formulated plans to expand winter planting, and are actively preparing winter cultivation seeds and fertilizers in conjunction with striving for over-production of late rice. The Jingtou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kaiping County plans to carry out winter cultivation on all 13 shi (a unit of dry measure) of fields in the cooperative, an expansion of three and a half times compared to last year. They have now begun to cultivate sweet potato seedlings for winter planting. According to statistics from seven cooperatives in Chenghai County, the winter cultivation area this year has expanded by more than 80 percent compared to last year. The Dingzhenhu Mutual Aid Group in Fengxi Township, Chaoan, in order to do a good job in preparing winter cultivation seeds, overcame the idea of "taking it slowly" through careful accounting. They found that the entire group was still short more than 22,000 sweet potato seedlings, and immediately decided to strengthen seedling cultivation, applying fertilizer one more time to solve the problem by cutting more seedlings, and launched a campaign among group members to exchange resources, solving the difficulties of three households lacking wheat seeds. In order to strive for higher yields of sweet potatoes, farmers in the eastern Guangdong region are vigorously expanding the planting area of rice-bottom sweet potatoes (planting sweet potato seedlings under the rice when the late rice turns yellow and is drained). The Silianshiang township in Chaoan county plans to do winter ploughing of one thousand two hundred mu this year. By the end of September, the whole township had already planted more than five hundred mu of rice-bottom sweet potatoes.

    广东省农民准备扩大冬种面积
    广东省各地农民积极进行冬耕的准备工作。根据中共中央华南分局指示，广东省今年冬耕种植面积将达到一千八百万亩，比去年扩大七百万亩，其中以生产番薯为主，因地制宜地种植一些小麦、油料、绿肥等作物；争取明年春收粮食二十亿斤，比去年增产百分之四十三。指示下达后，受到全省农民的热烈拥护，各农业生产合作社和互助组都纷纷订出了扩大冬种的计划，并结合争取晚稻的超额增产，积极进行冬耕种籽和冬耕肥料的准备工作。开平县径头农业生产合作社，计划全社十三石多田全部进行冬耕，比去年扩大了三倍半，现在他们已开始培育冬种的番薯苗。澄海县据七个社的统计，今年冬耕面积比去年扩大百分之八十以上。潮安凤溪乡丁镇湖互助联组，为了做好冬耕种籽的准备工作，通过算细账，克服了“慢慢来”的思想，检查出全组还缺番薯苗二万二千余条，即决定加强种苗的培育工作，多施一次肥，就可以多割一次种苗来解决，并发动组员中互通有无，解决了三户缺麦种的困难。粤东区农民为了争取番薯的更高产量，大力扩大稻底番薯的种植面积（晚稻黄熟排水时，即把薯苗在稻底下种）。潮安县四联乡计划今年冬耕一千二百亩，到九月底全乡已种下稻底番薯五百多亩。
