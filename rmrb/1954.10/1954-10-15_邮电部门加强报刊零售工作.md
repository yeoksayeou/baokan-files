    Postal Departments Strengthen Newspaper and Magazine Retail Sales

    Postal departments have strengthened the retail sales of newspapers and magazines in major cities across the country. As a result of the widespread opening of newspaper and magazine retail businesses in various branches and business offices of post offices in major cities, the retail sales volume of newspapers and magazines has greatly increased. The retail sales of newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in August increased by more than 50% compared to April. Postal distribution personnel regard the retail sale of newspapers and magazines as a glorious task, and on Sundays, they also bring newspapers to parks and public entertainment venues for readers to purchase and read. When newspapers publish important news, post offices make preparations in advance to increase the number of newspapers to meet the needs of readers. After the First National People's Congress passed the Constitution and the full text of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China was published in the September 21st newspapers, the eight major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an sold a total of more than 690,000 copies of newspapers that day. When the news of Comrade Mao Zedong's election as Chairman of the People's Republic of China was published in the September 28th newspapers, mobile postal vehicles from the Beijing Post Office were immediately surrounded by the masses when they appeared on the streets. In just a few hours, 54,000 copies of newspapers were sold throughout the city. Prior to this, after the June 15th newspapers publishing the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China were published, many people immediately came to post offices in various cities to purchase them. In Tianjin alone, more than 100,000 copies of newspapers were sold, and the Tianjin Dongmalu Post Office branch sold fifty times more newspapers than usual that day. On July 21st, when the news of the agreement reached at the Geneva Conference on the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Indochina reached Shanghai, various newspaper offices jointly published special editions. After the various postal branches announced the news of the publication of the special edition, factories, government offices, organizations, and schools called the post office in batches to pre-order, and citizens personally went to the post office to purchase them. 140,000 copies of the special edition were sold that day.
    Xinhua News Agency: In order to further strengthen the retail sales of newspapers and magazines and meet the needs of readers, the Postal General Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications held a forum on newspaper and magazine retail sales from September 20th to 29th to conduct special research and put forward many specific measures.

    邮电部门加强报刊零售工作
    邮电部门已在全国各大城市加强报纸杂志的零售工作。各大城市邮局普遍在各支局、营业处开办报刊零售业务的结果，报刊零售数量大大增加，北京、上海、广州三大城市的报纸零售数八月份就比四月份增加百分之五十以上。邮政发行人员把零售报刊当作光荣任务，每到星期日，还把报纸带到公园、公共娱乐场所去供读者购阅。当报纸刊登重要消息时，邮局就预作准备，增加报纸数量，以满足读者的需要。第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过宪法的消息和中华人民共和国宪法全文在九月二十一日的报纸上刊登出来后，北京、上海、天津、沈阳、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等八大城市这一天共零售报纸六十九万多份。九月二十八日报纸上刊登了毛泽东同志当选为中华人民共和国主席的消息，当北京邮局的流动邮车在街头出现时，立刻被群众包围起来。短短几个钟头，全市零售报纸五万四千份。在此以前，刊登着中华人民共和国宪法草案的六月十五日报纸出版后，各城市邮局立刻有许多人来购阅，仅天津一地就零售报纸十万多份，天津东马路邮政支局这一天零售报纸比平时增加五十倍。七月二十一日日内瓦会议关于印度支那停战和恢复和平问题达成协议的消息传到了上海，各报社联合出版了号外，当各邮政支局把出号外的消息公布后，各工厂、机关、团体、学校纷纷打电话向邮局成批预购，市民们亲自到邮局购买。这一天零售号外十四万份。
    中央邮电部邮政总局为了进一步加强报刊零售工作，满足读者需要，九月二十日到二十九日召开了报刊零售工作座谈会，进行专门研究，提出许多具体办法。（新华社）
