The Italian Peace Council Issues a Statement
    The Italian National Peace Council issued a statement. The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union's new proposal on holding free elections in Germany and peacefully resolving the German question has been warmly welcomed by world public opinion, which illustrates the fact that the idea of peacefully and harmoniously resolving the currently contentious issues in the world through consultation is widespread among the people of all countries.

    The statement said: The Italian National Peace Council would like to point out to public opinion that there are currently attempts to arm West Germany, dashing the hopes raised by the ceasefire in Indochina and the failure of the "European Defense Community" treaty. Therefore, the Italian National Peace Council once again points out that the German question must be resolved peacefully and harmoniously, a policy of effective unity and security for the people of European countries must be implemented, and armaments must be drastically reduced. The people of all countries, who once shattered the divisive and war-mongering conspiracies related to the "European Defense Community," now have new confidence to eliminate the danger of arming West Germany.

    The Italian National Peace Council calls on the people to fight against the rearmament of West Germany, against the ratification of the new agreements signed in Paris that lead to division and war, for the unity and security of the people of European countries, for the easing of international tensions, and for peace.

Speech by the Chairman of the Swedish Communist Party
    When the Chairman of the Swedish Communist Party, Hilding Hagberg, spoke during a general debate in Parliament, he pointed out that the plan to arm West Germany passed at the recent London and Paris conferences endangers European peace and security, especially that of the Scandinavian countries.

    Hagberg said: Once the plan to rearm West Germany is implemented, the prospect of West German armed forces being stationed on the territories of Denmark and Norway is very imminent, and these forces are very likely to be those Germans who occupied Denmark and Norway during the Second World War.

    Hagberg believes that the social democratic parties of Denmark and Norway agreeing to the policy of rearming West Germany and making West Germany join the North Atlantic bloc is "painful and deplorable."

    Hagberg concluded: We believe that Sweden should take the path of non-alignment. Establishing European collective security is in Sweden's interest.

Resolution by the Steering Committee of the Swiss Labor Party
    The "Forward" and "Voice of Labor" newspapers in Bern published a resolution passed by the Steering Committee of the Swiss Labor Party at its meeting on October 25. The resolution pointed out that the Paris Agreements and the so-called "Western European Union" pave the way for arming West Germany and reviving the German Wehrmacht, which poses a threat to the people of European countries. The resolution said: "For Switzerland, arming West Germany is a direct threat. The Swiss people have not forgotten that during the Second World War, the German General Staff had intended to occupy Switzerland, and only Hitler's defeat prevented this plan from being realized. The Labor Party calls on all its members and all peace advocates to rise up to stop this threat and intensify the struggle for peace."

    The resolution went on to say: The policy of dividing Europe and establishing military alliances stands in stark contrast to the clear proposal by the Soviet Union to hold talks between major powers to ease international tensions. If Europe is divided due to the policies of the "West" and its western part is under the rule of German imperialism, our neutrality and independence will be threatened. Conversely, if negotiations are agreed upon and European countries undertake obligations in a comprehensive collective security system, it will contribute to our security and independence.

Mass Protest Rally Held by the Norwegian People
    The Oslo "Freedom News" reported that a mass rally was held at the Oslo People's Building, where the Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, Emil Lövlien, delivered a speech. When talking about the rearmament of West Germany, Lövlien exposed the hypocrisy of the so-called Soviet threat to Western Europe. He pointed out that West German workers, especially the West German trade union federation, oppose German remilitarization. He spoke of the century of disasters that militaristic Germany has brought to Europe. Lövlien finally emphasized that major powers should hold meetings. The working people still have the opportunity to express their opinions and oppose the rearmament of Germany before Parliament approves these agreements.

    The meeting passed a resolution protesting the rearmament of West Germany and the inclusion of West Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization... The resolution called for negotiations between major powers to sign a collective security treaty that can guarantee European peace.

Many West German Newspapers Welcome New Soviet Proposals
    Many West German newspapers oppose the Paris Agreements on rearming West Germany and expressed welcome for the Soviet government's new proposal to hold a four-power conference.

    West Germany's "Labor World," the organ of the German Trade Union Federation, published an article welcoming the new Soviet proposal. The article said: The current situation requires that no opportunity to reach a peaceful resolution of the German question should be missed, because "this is a matter of our common destiny."

    The "German Weekly," published in Munich, criticized the results of the Paris Conference, emphasizing that the "sovereignty" that West Germany has obtained in Paris is a questionable sovereignty, because the Western occupying countries can use the reservations to counter any steps that could normalize West Germany's relations with the East and restore German unity. The "German Weekly" opposes the Paris plan to arm West Germany, and calls for the establishment of a pan-European collective security system, and the conclusion of an agreement on substantial arms reduction for all European countries.

    The Press Office of the German People's League for Unity, Peace and Freedom issued a statement saying that the London and Paris agreements are designed to prevent a pan-German agreement, thereby permanently trapping Germany in division. The statement welcomes the recent proposal by the Soviet government to hold a four-power conference in November to discuss the reunification of Germany and the holding of free all-German elections. The statement said: This opportunity for negotiation should be seized, because this demand is in line with the will of the vast majority of the German people.

### 欧洲人民反对重新武装西德的巴黎协定

    欧洲人民反对重新武装西德的巴黎协定
    意大利和平理事会发表声明
    意大利全国和平理事会发表声明。声明指出：苏联关于在德国进行自由选举及和平解决德国问题的新建议受到了世界舆论的热烈欢迎，这种情况说明了这样一个事实：要求在协商基础上和平地、协调一致地解决目前世界上争持不下的问题的思想，在各国人民当中是如何地普遍。
    声明说：意大利全国和平理事会愿向舆论指出：目前正有人企图武装西德，使印度支那停战和“欧洲防务集团”条约破产所引起的希望再度落空。因此，意大利全国和平理事会再一次指出：必须和平地、协调一致地解决德国问题，必须执行欧洲各国人民有效地团结和保障安全的政策，必须大量裁减军备。各国人民曾经击破和“欧洲防务集团”有关的分裂阴谋和战争阴谋，现在也有新的信心来消除武装西德的危险。
    意大利全国和平理事会号召人民为反对武装西德、为反对批准在巴黎所签订的导致分裂和战争的新协定而斗争，为欧洲各国人民的团结和安全、为缓和国际紧张局势、为和平而斗争。
  瑞典共产党主席发表演说
    瑞典共产党主席希尔丁·哈格堡在议会进行一般辩论时发言，指出最近伦敦会议和巴黎会议通过的武装西德的计划危及欧洲和平和安全，特别是危及斯堪的纳维亚国家。
    哈格堡说：重新武装西德的计划一旦实现，西德武装部队驻扎在丹麦和挪威两国领土上的前景就非常迫近，而这些部队还很可能是在第二次世界大战中占领丹麦和挪威的那些德国人。
    哈格堡认为：丹麦和挪威的社会民主党同意重新武装西德和使西德加入北大西洋集团的政策，这是“惨痛的、可悲的”。
    哈格堡最后说：我们认为瑞典应当走不参加联盟的路。建立欧洲集体安全是符合瑞典的利益的。
  瑞士劳动党指导委员会作出
      决议
    伯尔尼“前进报”和“工人之声报”刊登了瑞士劳动党指导委员会在十月二十五日举行的会议上通过的决议。决议指出：巴黎协定和所谓“西欧联盟”为武装西德和复活德国国防军铺平道路，这对欧洲各国人民是一种威胁。决议说：“对于瑞士来说，武装西德是一种直接的威胁。瑞士人民还没有忘记，在第二次世界大战时，德国总参谋部曾经打算占领瑞士，只是由于希特勒的失败才使这种计划无法实现。劳动党号召它所有的党员以及所有的和平拥护者起来制止这种威胁，并加紧为维护和平而斗争。”
    决议接着说：分裂欧洲和建立军事联盟的政策和苏联要求举行大国谈判以缓和国际紧张局势的明确建议形成鲜明的对照。如果欧洲由于“西方”的政策而陷于分裂而且它的西部处于德国帝国主义统治之下，我国的中立和独立就会受到威胁。相反地，如果同意举行谈判并由欧洲国家在一种包罗甚广的集体安全体系中承担义务，就会有助于我国的安全和独立。
  挪威人民举行群众抗议大会
    挪威奥斯陆“自由报”报道，奥斯陆人民大厦举行了群众大会，挪威共产党主席埃米尔·洛夫林在会上发表了演说。洛夫林在谈到重新武装西德时，揭露了那种所谓苏联威胁西欧说法的虚伪性。他指出：西德工人，特别是西德的工会联合会反对德国重新军国主义化。他谈到军国主义的德国已经给欧洲带来了长达一百年的灾害。洛夫林最后着重指出：大国应该举行会议。劳动人民仍然有机会表示他们的意见，在议会批准这些协定以前，反对重新武装德国。
    大会通过了决议，抗议重新武装西德，抗议使西德加入北大西洋公约组织……。决议要求大国进行谈判来签订一个能保障欧洲和平的集体安全条约。
    西德许多报纸欢迎苏联新建议西德许多报纸反对重新武装西德的巴黎协定，并表示欢迎苏联政府关于举行四国会议的新建议。
    西德的德国工会联合会机关报“劳工世界报”发表文章，欢迎苏联的新建议。文章说：目前的情况要求不放过任何一个可以达成和平解决德国问题的机会，因为“这是关乎我们共同命运的问题”。
    在慕尼黑出版的“德意志周报”抨击巴黎会议的结果，强调指出西德在巴黎所取得的“主权”是一种值得怀疑的主权，因为西方占领国家可以利用保留条件来对付任何能够使西德同东方关系正常化和恢复德国统一的步骤。“德意志周报”反对武装西德的巴黎计划，而要求建立全欧集体安全体系，并且就全体欧洲国家大量裁减军备问题缔结协定。
    德国人民争取统一、和平和自由联盟新闻处发表声明说：伦敦和巴黎协定是为了阻止达成全德协议，从而使德国永远陷于分裂。声明欢迎苏联政府最近提出的建议：在十一月间举行四大国会议，以讨论恢复德国统一问题和举行自由的全德选举问题。声明说：这个谈判的机会应该加以利用，因为这种要求是符合德国绝大多数人民的意志的。
