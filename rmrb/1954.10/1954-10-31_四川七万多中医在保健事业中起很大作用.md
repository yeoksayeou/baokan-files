    Over 70,000 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in Sichuan Province have played a significant role in people's healthcare. During the spring plowing and autumn harvesting seasons, many TCM practitioners participated in rural mobile medical services. In thirty-six counties and cities, including Zigong, Changshou, and Yilong, TCM practitioners accounted for more than 85% of the total personnel in the 779 mobile medical teams organized during this year's spring plowing production. They tirelessly went deep into mountainous and remote areas to treat farmers. In just about two months, more than 30,000 patients were treated by over 200 rural mobile medical teams in seventeen counties, including Yilong and Hongya. Many TCM medical departments, clinics, and joint clinics have also been established throughout the province, with more than 12,000 TCM practitioners participating in these organizations. These medical institutions are distributed in vast urban and rural areas. The TCM medical department of the Chengdu First People's Hospital has treated more than 200,000 patients in the past three years. Many joint clinics have also signed medical and preventive contracts with rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Because of their efforts to serve the people, TCM practitioners are welcomed by the masses. Many TCM practitioners have been named model patriots in health work. Huang Jichuan, a TCM physician specializing in hemorrhoids who is over ninety years old, was elected as a representative to the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, and TCM physician Wang Wending was also elected as a representative to the National People's Congress.

    四川七万多中医在保健事业中起很大作用
    四川省七万多中医在人民保健事业中起了很大作用。在春耕、秋收等生产季节中，许多中医参加农村巡回医疗。自贡、长寿、仪陇等三十六个县、市在今年春耕生产时组织的七百七十九个巡回医疗组中，中医就占总人数的百分之八十五以上。他们不辞劳苦地深入山区和边远地区为农民治病。仅仪陇、洪雅等十七个县的二百多个农村巡回医疗组，在约两个月内治疗的病人就有三万多。全省还成立了许多中医医疗部、门诊部和联合诊所，参加这些组织的中医有一万二千多人。这些医疗机构分布在广大城市和农村中。成都市第一人民医院中医医疗部三年多来治疗的病人有二十多万名。许多联合诊所还和农村互助合作组织订立医疗预防合同。中医由于努力为人民服务，受到群众的欢迎。不少中医被评为爱国卫生模范，九十多岁的痔漏科中医师黄济川被选为四川省人民代表大会代表，中医师王文鼎还当选为全国人民代表大会代表。
