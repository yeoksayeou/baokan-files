    The Tangshan Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau of Hebei Province attaches great importance to the work of handling people's letters. From January to the end of September this year, the bureau received a total of 507 letters from the people, all of which have been processed.
    The Construction Bureau's handling of people's letters is closely integrated with its business operations and is carried out with a humble and responsible attitude. They generally conduct timely investigations and research into the opinions reflected by the masses. If the opinions are correct, they are handled in accordance with the wishes of the masses; if they are incorrect, they patiently explain to the masses. This year, when the bureau planned to build the Wang Xiezhuang drainage canal, due to insufficient investigation and understanding of the situation beforehand, it had planned to demolish dozens of private houses near the Hele Pavilion on Yong'an Road to build the canal. When preparations were being made to start construction, the bureau received a letter from the residents of Hele Pavilion, which said: "There is a large sewer under our houses, so the government does not need to demolish the houses and rebuild." The leadership immediately sent people to investigate and found that there were indeed two very strong canals in that place, so they changed the demolition plan. Residents in the Xieyang Street, Yushan Lane, and Desheng Lane areas of the Second District had requested the construction of sewers to solve the problem of drainage during the rainy season. However, after investigation, it was found that the terrain in this area was low-lying and not suitable for the construction of sewers, and it involved many other problems, which would be extremely uneconomical. If a water surge collecting pool were built at the east end of these streets, the drainage problem could be solved in the same way. In order to make the masses understand the benefits of doing so, the bureau, through the district people's government, convened meetings of the masses in this area by sections to explain the above situation to the masses, and combined it with publicity and education on saving funds and supporting national industrial construction. As a result, the masses were very satisfied, and the problem was successfully resolved.
    The reason why the Construction Bureau has achieved success in handling people's letters is mainly because the leadership attaches importance to this work and has assigned a dedicated person to be responsible for it. The bureau regards handling people's letters as a regular task, and the bureau chief himself reads and approves larger issues. At the same time, the leadership also regularly urges the cadres who handle people's letters to conscientiously study relevant documents on handling people's letters in order to improve and enhance their work. In addition, a series of systems such as assignment, urging, and archiving have been established to ensure the timely and proper handling of people's letters.

    唐山市人民政府建设局认真处理人民来信
    河北省唐山市人民政府建设局重视处理人民来信的工作。从今年一月到九月底，该局共收到人民来信五百零七件，业已全部处理完毕。
    建设局处理人民来信的工作是和业务紧密结合进行的，并且采取了虚心和负责的态度。他们对群众所反映的意见，一般都能及时进行调查研究。正确的，即按群众的意见办理；不正确的，便耐心地向群众解释。今年，该局在计划修建王谢庄下水道大干沟时，因事先调查了解情况不够，曾计划拆除永安路合乐馆附近的几十间民房，修建大沟。当准备动工时，接到了合乐馆居民的来信，信上说：“在我们房底下有大下水道，政府不用拆房重建。”领导上立即派人下去勘察，发现那个地方真的有两条很坚固的大干沟，于是改变了拆房的计划。二区斜阳街、裕善里、德盛里一带的居民曾要求修建下水道，解决雨季排水的问题。但经过调查，这一带地势低洼，不适宜修建下水道，而且牵涉到其他很多问题，极不经济。如果在这几条街的东头分别做一个聚水的水浪，同样可以解决排水问题。为了使群众了解这样做的好处，该局通过了区人民政府召集这一带群众分片开会，向群众说明以上的情况，并结合进行了节约资金，支援国家工业建设的宣传教育。结果，群众非常满意，问题便顺利地解决了。
    建设局在处理人民来信的工作上获得成绩的原因，主要是领导上对这项工作重视，并有专人负责。该局把处理人民来信当作经常性的工作，较大的问题，都由局长自己批阅。同时，领导上还经常督促处理人民群众来信的干部认真学习有关处理人民群众来信的文件，以便改进和提高工作，此外，又规定了交办、催办和归档等一系列的制度，以保证及时妥善地处理人民来信。
