Comrades and Friends,

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me, on behalf of the Bulgarian people, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government, the homeland of Dimitrov, to extend to you and the great Chinese people our warmest, fraternal congratulations.

The founding of the People's Republic of China is the result of years of arduous and heroic struggle by the Chinese people under the inspiration and leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its long-tested leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. In the struggle for freedom and national independence, the Chinese people have made great sacrifices, and in this struggle, the Chinese people have always received the warm sympathy and support of the Soviet people, the international revolutionary workers' movement, and progressive forces throughout the world, including our modest, hardworking Bulgarian people. The example of collective heroism demonstrated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, workers, peasants, laboring intellectuals, and the finest sons and daughters of the Chinese people has always inspired our workers and peasants in their struggle against fascist autocracy and for freedom and national independence.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have finally and forever broken free from generations of feudal oppression, colonial dependence, and imperialist enslavement, and have established a powerful, unified multi-ethnic state—the People's Republic of China—whose various ethnic groups are forever united in a harmonious and friendly family. The people's democratic regime has realized the ideals and hopes of Chinese workers and peasants for many years, created conditions for the gradual elimination of the exploitation of the working class, and distributed the land of the landlords to the peasants. This has further consolidated the worker-peasant alliance forged in the long struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the past five years, the free Chinese people, through their creative labor, have taken a major step forward in developing the national economy and improving the material and cultural standards of the working people. These great achievements of the Chinese people have been affirmed and consolidated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China unanimously adopted by the First National People's Congress.

These historically significant victories won by the Chinese people under the banner of the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism deeply rejoice the Bulgarian people who are engaged in the socialist construction of their motherland.

The role of the Chinese people in the struggle to safeguard world peace is great. The joint struggle of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other peace-loving countries has achieved new successes in the peaceful settlement of international issues, eased international tensions, and expanded cooperation among the peoples of all countries. The Bulgarian people warmly support the struggle of the peoples of all countries for peace, in which the Chinese people are a powerful force.

Dear Comrades and Friends! Sincere, fraternal friendship has linked the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples together, and this friendship is being increasingly consolidated with the continuous expansion of economic and cultural ties between the two countries. What connects the Bulgarian and Chinese peoples is also their unbreakable common friendship with the great Soviet people. The Bulgarian and Chinese peoples faithfully protect and constantly consolidate this friendship, which is absolutely indispensable for safeguarding the national independence of the two peoples, consolidating peace, and building socialism.

On this most glorious day of your National Day, we, on behalf of the Bulgarian people, the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, sincerely hope that the fraternal Chinese people, its glorious Communist Party, and the People's Government will achieve even greater success in further consolidating the people's democratic regime, improving the living welfare of the working people, completely unifying all of China under the victorious banner of the People's Republic of China, and striving for lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Long live the great Chinese people and its leader and inspirer—the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

May the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples and the unbreakable common friendship between the peoples of the two countries and the great Soviet people continue to be consolidated and developed!

Long live the People's Republic of China, the faithful friend of the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world, and a powerful factor in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world!

    保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团团长
    达米扬诺夫的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    正当中华人民共和国成立五周年的时候，请允许我代表保加利亚人民、保加利亚共产党和政府、季米特洛夫的祖国向你们和伟大的中国人民致以最热烈的、兄弟的祝贺。
    中华人民共和国的成立，是中国人民在光荣的中国共产党和它的久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志的鼓舞和领导下，进行了多年的艰苦而英勇的斗争的结果。在争取自由和民族独立的斗争中，中国人民曾作了巨大的牺牲，在这个斗争中，中国人民始终得到苏联人民、国际革命的工人运动和全世界进步力量的热烈同情和支持，其中也包括我们区区的、热爱劳动的保加利亚人民。中国人民解放军、工人、农民、劳动知识分子和中国人民最优秀的儿女所表现的集体英雄主义的榜样，一直鼓舞着我国工人和农民进行反对法西斯专制、争取自由和民族独立的斗争。
    中国人民在共产党的领导下，终于永远摆脱了世世代代的封建压迫、殖民地的附属地位和帝国主义的奴役，建立了一个强大的、统一的多民族国家——中华人民共和国，这个国家的各族人民永远团结在一个和睦的、友爱的大家庭中。人民民主政权已经使中国工人和农民许多年来的理想和希望实现了，它为逐步消灭对工人阶级的剥削创造了条件，并且把地主的土地分给了农民。这就更进一步巩固了在长期反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争中所结成的工农联盟。五年来，自由的中国人民由于自己创造性的劳动，已经在发展国民经济和提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平中，向前迈了一大步。中国人民这些伟大的成就，已经在第一届全国人民代表大会一致通过的中华人民共和国宪法中肯定和巩固下来了。
    中国人民在马克思主义—列宁主义的不朽思想的胜利旗帜下所取得的这些具有历史意义的胜利，使正在从事祖国的社会主义建设的保加利亚人民深深地感到欢欣鼓舞。
    中国人民在维护世界和平的斗争中的作用是伟大的。苏联、中华人民共和国和其他爱好和平的国家共同奋斗，在和平解决国际问题上取得了新的成就，使国际紧张局势得到缓和，使各国人民间的合作得到扩大。保加利亚人民热烈支持各国人民争取和平的斗争，在这个斗争中中国人民是一支强大的力量。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！真诚的、兄弟的友谊已经把保加利亚人民和中国人民连结起来了，这种友谊正随着保中两国之间的经济和文化联系的不断扩大而日益巩固。把保中两国人民连结在一起的，还有他们和伟大苏联人民的牢不可破的共同友谊。保中两国人民忠诚地保护着并不断地巩固着这种友谊，这种友谊是维护两国人民的民族独立、巩固和平和建设社会主义所绝对不可缺少的。
    在你们国庆这个最光辉的日子里，我们谨代表保加利亚人民、保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民共和国政府，衷心希望兄弟的中国人民、它的光荣的共产党和人民政府在进一步巩固人民民主政权、提高劳动人民的生活福利、在中华人民共和国的胜利旗帜下完全统一全中国、争取亚洲和世界的持久和平的斗争中，获得更大的成就。
    伟大的中国人民和它的领导者和鼓舞者——以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党万岁！
    愿中国人民和保加利亚人民之间的兄弟友谊以及两国人民和伟大的苏联人民的牢不可破的共同友谊不断巩固和发展！
    苏联和世界一切爱好和平的人民的忠实朋友、维护远东和世界和平的强大因素——中华人民共和国万岁！
