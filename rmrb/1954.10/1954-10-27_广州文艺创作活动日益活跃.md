    Guangzhou's literary and artistic workers' creative activities are becoming increasingly active. In the past six months, the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese Writers Association has organized writers and creative cadres to go deep into factories, rural areas, and fishing areas to experience life. They have already created some works, and some writers are currently writing. These works include novels, film scripts, dramas, features, poems, and scripts for documentary films. Some of these works reflect the heroic struggle of the people of Hainan Island, some depict the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas, and some reflect the new lives of workers, overseas Chinese hometowns, and fishermen. It is expected that ten works and a collection of literary essays will be published in Guangzhou this winter and next spring. In addition, amateur literary and artistic workers in Guangzhou have also created some excellent literary and artistic works.

    Recently, fine art workers in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have also created many works reflecting the new life. In August of this year, fine art workers from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a fine art exhibition in Guangzhou. Recently, fine art workers in Guangzhou City have again gone to factories, farms, and fishing ports to experience life in order to carry out new creations.

    The South China Drama Troupe is currently rehearsing "The Way Out" and "The Call of Life." In the past six months, the South China Song and Dance Troupe has sent people to areas such as eastern Guangdong and Hainan Island to delve into the folk customs, collect materials, and create song and dance programs such as "Casting Nets for Fish," "Bayin Dance," and "Yingge."

    广州文艺创作活动日益活跃
    广州市文艺工作者的创作活动日益活跃。中国作家协会广州分会半年多来，组织作家和创作干部深入工厂、农村、渔区体验生活，他们已经创作了一些作品，有些作家正在写作。这些作品包括小说、电影脚本、话剧、特写、诗歌、文献纪录影片脚本等。这些作品有的反映海南岛人民的英勇斗争，有的表现农村的互助合作运动，有的反映工人、华侨家乡和渔民的新的生活。预计今冬明春，将有十部作品和一部文学论文集在广州出版。此外，广州市工人业余文艺工作者也创作了一些优秀的文艺作品。
    广东省和广州市的美术工作者最近也创作了很多反映新生活的作品。今年八月，广东省、广州市的美术工作者曾在广州举行一次美术展览会。最近，广州市的美术工作者又分别前往工厂、农场、渔港体验生活，以便进行新的创作。
