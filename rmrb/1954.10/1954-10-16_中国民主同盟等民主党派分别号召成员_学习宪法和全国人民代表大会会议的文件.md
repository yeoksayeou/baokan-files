The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic League, the Central Standing Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Central Standing Committee of the Jiusan Society have each issued instructions to their subordinate local organizations, calling on all members to study the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, and to conduct extensive publicity among the masses they are in contact with.

The instruction from the Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic League stated: When studying the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, emphasis should be placed on understanding the nature of our country, the steps for transitioning to a socialist society, and our superior people's democratic political system. Members of the League and the masses they are in contact with should be encouraged to exercise their democratic rights, actively participate in and supervise the work of all aspects of the state; at the same time, they should be encouraged to consciously fulfill their obligations to the state, abide by the constitution, laws, labor discipline, public order, cherish public property, and defend the motherland, in order to guarantee the victorious completion of our country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. When studying Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, emphasis should be placed on the achievements of our country's construction in various fields over the past five years and the important issues in the current work in various fields pointed out in the report. It is necessary to encourage the enthusiasm of League members and the masses they are in contact with for building the motherland, and mobilize them to give play to their initiative and creativity, and work together to solve the various problems in the country's current work. In particular, we should actively participate in and enthusiastically support the task of liberating Taiwan, which has been put forward to defend our country's territorial integrity, defend our country's socialist construction, and defend peace in Asia and the world. When studying the above documents, it is also necessary to link them with the tasks of the League, discuss how to further unite upper and middle-level intellectuals, jointly carry out ideological remolding, and give full play to their abilities to serve the cause of socialist construction, so that the role of the people's democratic united front can be more fully developed in cultural and educational undertakings.

The Central Standing Council of the China Association for Promoting Democracy held its 81st (enlarged) meeting on October 3rd. The meeting was attended by central standing council members, central council members in Beijing, and responsible comrades of local organizations of the China Association for Promoting Democracy who were elected as representatives to the National People's Congress. The meeting focused on discussing how the China Association for Promoting Democracy should strengthen its work and organization in the future based on the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The meeting unanimously agreed that the primary task at present is to call on members to study the Constitution, deeply understand the essence of the Constitution, and then implement it into action, take the lead in abiding by the law, lead the masses they are in contact with to improve the quality of their work, do their work well, and strive for the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Finally, the meeting decided to issue a notice to local organizations to study and implement the Constitution and the documents of the National People's Congress, calling on all members to conscientiously study and publicize the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong's opening speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution, and Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report; deeply understand the essence of the Constitution and these important reports, correctly understand the tasks of the people's democratic united front stipulated in the Constitution, and further give play to the role that the China Association for Promoting Democracy should play in the transition period of the country; in the study, we must closely link it with our own thoughts, work, and life realities, appropriately carry out criticism and self-criticism, further draw a clear line between socialism and non-socialism in ideology, strengthen socialist transformation, and regard the process of study as a process of ideological remolding. All members should actively participate in and supervise the work of all aspects of the state, and promote the acceleration of the work in all aspects. At the same time, they should consciously and seriously abide by the Constitution and laws, and give full play to their abilities to ensure that their work is done well. Every member should pay attention to conducting extensive publicity work among the masses, and use their own active actions to lead and influence the masses they are in contact with, so that they will be more firmly united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and contribute all their strength to the socialist cause.

The Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held its tenth (enlarged) meeting on October 3rd. A total of thirty-two people attended the meeting. Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Central Executive Bureau, pointed out at the meeting that the task of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the future is to closely unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, further strengthen ideological remolding, actively play the role of the organization, resolutely implement the spirit and resolutions of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, strive to publicize, abide by, and safeguard the Constitution, and strive for the thorough realization of the Constitution.

More than forty people attended the meeting, which was presided over by Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Central Standing Committee, and discussed how to implement and organize members to study the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and several important documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress.
