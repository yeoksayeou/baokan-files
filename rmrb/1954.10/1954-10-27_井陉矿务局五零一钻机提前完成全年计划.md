Jingxing Mining Bureau's No. 501 Drilling Rig Completes Annual Plan Ahead of Schedule

    The No. 501 drilling rig of the Geology Department of the Hebei Province State-owned Jingxing Mining Bureau completed the state's annual drilling plan ahead of schedule on October 16th. The core recovery rate and coal core recovery rate both exceeded the state's targets, saving the state approximately 150 million yuan for the year, and basically achieved safe operation.

    The No. 501 drilling rig won the honorary title of "Model Drilling Rig" of the entire mining bureau last year. This year, after studying the general task of the state during the transition period, the drilling rig's employees became more enthusiastic about production and conscientiously promoted the "Production Management Instruction Chart" and "Progress and Quality Comparison Table for Each Shift," enabling all workers to care about the completion of the plan. Through work such as "Safety Grand Inspection" and "Quality Grand Inspection," they established and improved systems such as the shift handover system, safety inspection system, and machine maintenance system, eliminating personal accidents and greatly reducing mechanical and borehole accidents, basically achieving safe operation. They attached great importance to learning and implementing advanced experience, improving work efficiency. In addition, they were also able to carry out criticism and self-criticism, holding a review meeting once a week, helping each other, learning from each other, and improving their skills together. Since the beginning of this year, five workers from the drilling rig have been promoted to machine captains and shift leaders, and seven new workers have quickly mastered drilling technology.

    Now, all employees of the drilling rig have decided to make persistent efforts to strive to increase production and save more wealth for the country.

    井陉矿务局五零一钻机提前完成全年计划
    河北省国营井陉矿务局地质处五零一号钻机在十月十六日提前完成了全年的国家钻探计划，岩芯采取率和煤芯采取率都超过了国家指标，全年约为国家节约一亿五千万元左右，基本上做到了安全运转。
    五零一号钻机去年曾获得全矿务局“模范钻机”的光荣称号。今年，该钻机职工在学习了国家过渡时期总任务后，生产积极性更加提高，认真推行了“生产管理指示图表”和“各班进度、质量比较表”等，使全体工人关心计划的完成情况。他们通过“安全大检查”、“质量大检查”等工作，建立和健全了交接班制、安全检查制、机器检修制等制度，消灭了人身事故、并使机械和孔内事故大大减少，基本上达到了安全运转。他们十分重视学习与贯彻先进经验，提高了工作效率。此外，他们也能开展批评和自我批评，每周开一次检讨会，互相帮助，互相学习，共同提高技术。今年以来，该钻机有五名工人被提拔为机长和班长，有七个新工人很快掌握了钻探技术。
    现在该钻机全体职工，决定再接再厉为给国家增产节约更多财富而奋斗。
