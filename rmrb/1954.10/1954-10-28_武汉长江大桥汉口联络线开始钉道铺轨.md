    Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Hankou Connecting Line Begins Track Laying

    The earthwork for the Hankou connecting line of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completed on October 15th, and the track laying officially began on October 20th.

    The Hankou connecting line runs from the end station of Jinghan Road—Yudaimen—to the Han River bridgehead, with a total length of nearly two kilometers. It is one of the preparatory projects for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and will also be the connection line between Jinghan Road and Yuehan Road in the future.

    The Hankou connecting line project started in February of this year, and by the end of June, all earthwork was nearly completed. After the Wuhan flood season began, all employees of the Hankou railway construction zone participated in the flood control efforts. During the most critical period of the Wuhan flood, 55,000 cubic meters of earth were excavated from the already constructed Hankou connecting line to build dikes. After the victory of the Wuhan flood control, all employees and civilian workers, with the support of the Hankou Railway Transportation Sub-bureau, immediately carried out the backfilling project to ensure the early opening of the Han River Railway Bridge. During the backfilling, they devoted themselves to their work with the fighting spirit of participating in flood control, successfully completing the entire earthwork project.

    Currently, track laying is underway, and slope construction has begun. All employees are enthusiastically launching a labor competition in the increase production and practice economy movement. The “Flying Squad” workers responsible for track laying, 50 people, completed the track preparation work originally scheduled for 70 people one day ahead of schedule. They expressed that they would complete the entire track laying project of the Hankou connecting line before the end of the month. Soon, trains will pass through this connecting line and the Han River Railway Bridge to Hanyang.

    武汉长江大桥汉口联络线开始钉道铺轨
    武汉长江大桥汉口联络线土方工程已于十月十五日全部完成，十月二十日正式开始钉道铺轨。
    汉口联络线是从京汉路的终点站——玉带门起直到汉水桥头的联络线，全长将近两公里，它是武汉长江大桥的准备工程之一，也是将来的京汉路与粤汉路的联结线。
    汉口联络线工程是在今年二月开工的，到六月底全部土方工程接近完成。武汉防汛开始后，汉口线路工区全体职工都参加了防汛斗争。在武汉防汛最紧急的时期，将已筑成的汉口联络线挖去五万五千方土方修筑堤防。武汉防汛胜利以后，全体职工、民工为了保证汉水铁桥早日通车，在汉口铁路运输分局的支援下，立即进行了还土工程。在还土期间，他们以参加防汛的战斗精神投入了工作，使全部土方工程胜利完成。
    目前，钉道铺轨工作正紧张进行，修筑边坡工作已经开始。全体职工在增产节约运动中热烈地展开了劳动竞赛。担任钉道的“飞班”工人，五十人提前一天完成原定要七十人担任的钉道准备工作。他们表示要在月底以前完成汉口联络线的全部钉道铺轨工程。不久，火车就要通过这条联络线和汉水铁桥直到汉阳。
