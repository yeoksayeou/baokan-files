Local state-owned livestock companies have generally conducted surveys and research into livestock sources this year. In the Central South, Southwest, and East China regions alone, more than 30 new commodities that can be organized for export have been discovered, including gazelle skin, sea dog skin, and marten fur. Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Guangdong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces have discovered precious Angora rabbit hair. In the warm climate of Hainan Island and Guangxi Province, more than 20 kinds of valuable animal skins such as otter skin and fox skin have also been discovered. The survey also found that the work of purchasing livestock products in some areas has not been well developed. For example, the planned purchase volume of pig casings, which are selling well in the international market, in Zhejiang Province only accounts for 24 percent of the production volume, and there is no purchase at all in Fujian Province. The planned purchase volume in the Central South region this year is only 39 percent of the production volume. Marmots in Xikang Province are running around everywhere, and few people hunt them.

After investigation and research, and discovering abundant sources of goods, the livestock company system is actively trying to expand its purchasing business. Guangxi and Fujian provinces have established provincial leading bodies for livestock companies, and livestock companies in Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan and other provinces have added branch companies and offices. The Henan Provincial Livestock Company has now established business relationships with 114 county cooperative federations, and 346 district supply and marketing cooperatives in the province are engaged in livestock products. The Henan, Hunan, Sichuan and other provincial companies of the China Livestock Company have helped the supply and marketing cooperatives train cadres to manage livestock products. Livestock companies in Ji'an, Ganzhou and other places in Jiangxi Province, under the leadership of the local government, have signed contracts with hunters and others to organize the masses to hunt. The Jiujiang Office of the Provincial Livestock Company also organized more than 300 peddlers to go deep into the mountainous areas to carry out purchasing work. (Yu Huan Chen)

    各地畜产公司调查畜产货源扩大收购业务
    各地国营畜产公司今年普遍进行了畜产货源的调查研究工作。仅中南、西南、华东三个地区，现已发现可以组织出口的新商品，即有黄羊皮、海狗皮、香狸毛等三十多种。四川、江西、浙江、广西、广东、河南、江苏、安徽等省，都发现了珍贵的安格拉兔毛。在气候暖和的海南岛和广西省也发现了水獭皮、狐狸皮等二十多种贵重兽皮。调查中还发现有些地区收购畜产品的工作没有很好展开。如当前国际市场上畅销的猪肠衣，浙江省的计划收购量仅占生产量的百分之二十四，福建省就根本没有收购，中南区今年的计划收购量也不过占产量的百分之三十九。西康省的旱獭满地乱窜，很少有人猎取。
    经过调查研究，发现丰富的货源以后，畜产公司系统积极设法扩大收购业务。广西、福建两省建立了畜产公司省的领导机构，四川、西康、贵州、云南等省的畜产公司增设了支公司和办事处。河南省的畜产公司现在已经和一百一十四个县合作社联合社建立了业务关系，全省已有三百四十六个区供销合作社经营畜产品。中国畜产公司河南、湖南、四川等省公司都帮助供销合作社训练了经营畜产的干部。江西省吉安、赣州等地的畜产公司在当地政府领导下，和猎户等签订合同组织群众打猎。该省畜产公司九江办事处还组织了三百多名小贩，深入山区开展收购工作。（于焕宸）
