    Bohai Agricultural Cooperative in Funing County Achieves Overall Bumper Harvest
    All Members Prepare to Sell More Than One Million Jin of Surplus Grain to the State
    The Bohai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhujiantuo Township, Funing County, Hebei Province, has achieved an overall bumper harvest this year. The cooperative's more than 1,800 mu of paddy fields yielded an average of over 500 jin per mu, exceeding the yield of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers by 100 to 200 jin per mu. Among them, 80 mu of high-yield fields achieved an average yield of up to 1,000 jin per mu. Although the 6,300 mu of dry land crops suffered from floods, the average yield still reached more than 240 jin per mu, exceeding that of farmers outside the cooperative by more than 40 jin. Currently, members are busy drying and cleaning the surplus grain to sell to the state.
    After the establishment of the Bohai Agricultural Cooperative this spring, the state handed over more than 1,800 mu of state-owned paddy fields to them for cultivation, solving the problem of surplus labor and providing various loans of more than 370 million yuan. Therefore, the members' enthusiasm for production was greatly boosted. This spring, due to drought, all 760 members of the cooperative carried water to plant seeds for 27 days, completing the sowing of corn, cotton, and sorghum in a timely manner. They also excavated a 300-zhang-long canal to transport fresh water, ensuring timely irrigation for the paddy fields and avoiding flooding in the summer. This year, the cooperative also bought 140,000 jin of fertilizer, applying 20 to 30 jin of chemical fertilizer and bone meal per mu of paddy rice. In the past, rice planthoppers could not be eliminated by manual capture, but this year the cooperative quickly eliminated the pests by spraying 666 powder, ensuring the normal growth of seedlings. This year, the cooperative not only promptly pruned and weeded cotton, but also promptly controlled the three occurrences of insect pests with pesticides; more than 1,000 mu of corn were all artificially pollinated three times, and other crops were also hoed one or two more times than in previous years. As a result, the cooperative's irrigated and dry land crops achieved a bumper harvest.
    Due to the cooperative's abundant harvest, the income of the members has also greatly increased. Last year, when the unified purchase and sale of grain was implemented, 80 percent of the cooperative's 446 households were short of grain. This year, more than 90 percent of the cooperative's households have surplus grain. Before joining the cooperative, member Bai Rong's annual grain harvest could only last until winter. This year, he and his son worked 400 labor days in the cooperative, and according to the pre-autumn harvest distribution plan, they can receive more than 8,000 jin of grain. After deducting the food and other expenses for his family of four, there will be more than 6,500 jin of surplus grain. This year, the cooperative will sell more than one million jin of surplus grain to the state, a figure that exceeds ten times the total surplus grain sold by the entire township last year.

    抚宁县渤海农业合作社获得全面丰收
    全体社员准备把一百多万斤余粮卖给国家
    河北省抚宁县朱建坨乡渤海农业生产合作社，今年获得全面大丰收。全社一千八百多亩水稻平均每亩产五百多斤，比当地互助组和单干农民每亩多收一百到二百斤，其中八十亩丰产田平均每亩产量高达一千斤。六千三百亩旱田作物虽遭受水灾，但平均每亩仍产二百四十多斤，比社外农民多收四十斤以上。目前社员们正忙着把余粮晒干扬净卖给国家。
    渤海农业社今春成立后，国家就将一千八百多亩国有稻田交给他们耕种，解决了他们多余劳动力的出路问题，同时还发放了各种贷款三亿七千多万元。因此，大大鼓舞了社员们的生产积极性。今年春播时，天旱不雨，全社七百六十多名社员挑水点种二十七天，适时完成了玉米、棉花、高粱的播种任务。并开挖了一道三百多丈长的输送甜水干渠，使水稻得到适时灌溉，并且还避免了夏季内涝灾害。今年该社还买了十四万斤肥料，每亩水稻追施了二、三十斤化学肥料和骨粉。过去用人工捉捕不能消灭的稻包虫害，今年社里用六六六粉喷射很快就消灭了虫害，保证了秧苗的正常生长。今年社里棉花不仅作到及时整枝除草，发生三次虫害都被及时用农药捕灭；一千多亩玉米全部实行人工授粉三次，其他农作物也都比往年多锄了一至两次，因而全社的水旱作物获得大丰收。
    由于社里庄稼丰收，社员的收入也大大增加。去年实行粮食统购统销时，全社四百四十六户就有百分之八十是缺粮户。而今年全社已有百分之九十以上的户有余粮。社员白荣在未入社前，每年收的粮食只能维持到冬季，今年他和儿子在社里做了四百个劳动日，按秋收前预分方案计算，可分得八千多斤粮食，除了全家四口人食用及其它开支外，还有六千五百多斤余粮。全社今年将有一百多万斤余粮卖给国家，这数字超过去年全乡卖余粮总数的十倍。　（毛凤恩）
