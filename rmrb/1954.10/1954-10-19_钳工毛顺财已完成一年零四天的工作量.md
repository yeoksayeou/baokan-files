Fitter Mao Shuncai Has Completed One Year and Four Days' Worth of Work
Mao Shuncai, a fitter at the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory and a Shanghai Municipal Model Worker, had completed one year and four days' worth of work by October 8th, with a product qualification rate of over 99.6%.

Since January of this year, he has made six improvements in operating methods and creative rationalization proposals, such as the creation of a universal drilling platform, which can reduce heavy tasks such as laborious center alignment. In addition to paying attention to saving auxiliary time, he also emphasizes safe production. There have been no production accidents or work-related injuries since the beginning of this year.
