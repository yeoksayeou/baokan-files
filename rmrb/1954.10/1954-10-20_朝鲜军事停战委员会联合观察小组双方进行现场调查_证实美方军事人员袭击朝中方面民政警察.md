Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong: Both sides of the Fourth Joint Observation Team of the Korean Military Armistice Commission met on the afternoon of the 12th to conduct a joint on-site investigation into the incident on the 11th, in which US military personnel intruded into the demilitarized zone of the Korean-Chinese side, killing and wounding one civilian policeman of the Korean-Chinese side and abducting another. The investigation fully confirmed that the US side bears full responsibility for this serious violation of the armistice agreement.

The investigation began at 2:25 p.m. on the 12th and ended at 5:15 p.m. Both members of the Fourth Joint Observation Team successively examined the body of Li Zhisan, the civilian policeman of the Korean-Chinese side who was killed by the US military personnel, and various pieces of evidence, and questioned witnesses. The investigation proved that the incident occurred in the demilitarized zone of the Korean-Chinese side, north of the military demarcation line. Li Zhisan's body clearly displayed the armband of the civilian police of the Korean-Chinese side on his left arm. There were four wounds on the deceased. One bullet entered from the upper left of the back and exited from the upper left of the chest. Another bullet entered from the lower abdomen and exited from the left thigh. There was a bayonet wound below the right ear. A section of the left middle finger had been cut off by a knife. The entire body was covered in blood. A US military bayonet used in the attack was found one meter away from the body, bearing the inscription "US M4 IMPERIAL." Bloodstains were found on the blade of the bayonet and the wire wrapped around the handle. A piece of US military poncho was also found six meters from the body. In addition, a hat originally worn by Kim Inhuan, the civilian policeman of the Korean-Chinese side who was wounded and abducted, was found near the body. Fifty-one large and small bloodstains were found along the route from the scene to the military demarcation line, which were clearly fresh blood left by Kim Inhuan after being wounded and abducted to the US side.

After inspecting the scene, both members questioned Song Shilian and Jin Lirun, civilian police officers of the Korean-Chinese side. The witnesses testified that at around 5:40 a.m. on the 11th (previous reports mistakenly stated the afternoon), while they were patrolling about 600 meters northeast of the incident site, they heard gunshots from the southwest. When they arrived at the scene at around 6:15 a.m. to investigate, they discovered Li Zhisan's body and the aforementioned bayonet, poncho, Kim Inhuan's hat, and other items, and discovered the aforementioned bloodstains along the route from the scene to near the military demarcation line.

All of the above evidence fully confirms this serious violation of the armistice agreement by the US side. The US member of the Fourth Joint Observation Team disregarded such conclusive facts and tried to quibble in every possible way. He even claimed that the bloodstains on the murder weapon left behind by the US military personnel were rust. The Korean-Chinese member immediately questioned the US member: "Are the bloodstains on the rubber coating of the wire wrapped around the bayonet handle also rust?" The US member was left speechless.

The two members finally agreed to meet at 2:00 p.m. on the 14th to discuss submitting a joint special report to the Military Armistice Commission.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong: On the afternoon of the 14th, both members of the Fourth Joint Observation Team met to discuss submitting a joint special report to the Military Armistice Commission regarding the incident in which US military personnel murdered and kidnapped civilian police of the Korean-Chinese side in the demilitarized zone.

During the meeting, based on various pieces of evidence from the joint investigation, the Korean-Chinese member demanded that the US side immediately return Kim Inhuan, the civilian policeman of the Korean-Chinese side who was abducted by the US military personnel. The US member continued to disregard the facts, quibbled unreasonably, and refused to submit a joint report. The Korean-Chinese member therefore decided to submit a special report to the Military Armistice Commission separately.

The Korean-Chinese side's special report stated: "Based on irrefutable facts, it is proven that US armed personnel illegally crossed the military demarcation line and intruded into the Dousudong area in the demilitarized zone under the jurisdiction of the Korean-Chinese side for the purpose of murdering and kidnapping civilian police of the Korean-Chinese side, resulting in a serious violation of the armistice agreement in which one civilian police officer of the Korean-Chinese side was killed and another was abducted."

    朝鲜军事停战委员会联合观察小组双方进行现场调查
    证实美方军事人员袭击朝中方面民政警察
     【新华社开城讯】朝鲜军事停战委员会第四联合观察小组双方组员于十二日下午会晤，对十一日美方军事人员侵入朝中方面非军事区并打死、打伤和劫走朝中方面民政警察各一人的事件，共同进行了现场调查，调查结果完全证实了美方对这一严重违反停战协定的事件，应负完全责任。
    调查从十二日下午二时二十五分开始，到五时十五分结束。第四联合观察小组双方组员先后查看了被美方军事人员打死的朝中方面民政警察李治三的尸体和各种证物，并询问了证人。调查证明，事件发生的地点在军事分界线以北的朝中方面非军事区内。李治三的尸体的左臂上显明地佩有朝中方面民政警察的臂章。死者身上有四处伤痕。一颗子弹从后背左上方穿入，从前胸左上方穿出。另一颗子弹从小腹穿入，从左大腿穿出。右耳下有刺刀伤痕。左手中指被刀削去一块。整个尸体沾满了血迹。在尸体旁边一公尺外遗有美方军事人员行凶的刺刀一把，上有“US M4 IMPERIAL”字样，刺刀刃和缠在刺刀把上的电线上都沾有血迹。在尸体旁边六公尺处，还遗有一块美军军用雨布。另外，在尸体旁边遗有被打伤和劫走的朝中方面民政警察金仁焕原戴用的帽子一顶，从现场到军事分界线沿途有大小血迹五十一处，这显然是金仁焕被打伤后又被劫往美方地区时沿途流下的鲜血。
    双方组员在视察现场后，又询问了证人朝中方面民政警察宋世连和金利润。证人的证词说：十一日早晨（以前报道误为下午）五时四十分左右，他们在事件发生地点东北六百公尺处执行巡逻任务时，听见西南方向有枪声，当他们在六时十五分左右赶到出事地点搜查时，即发现李治三的尸体和上述刺刀、雨布、金仁焕的帽子等物，并发现上述自现场到军事分界线附近沿途的血迹。
    以上种种证据充分证实了美方这一严重违反停战协定的事件。第四联合观察小组美方组员竟不顾如此确凿的事实，一味妄图狡赖。他竟说美方军事人员遗下的凶器上的血迹是铁锈。朝中方面组员当即质问美方组员：“难道刺刀把上缠的电线上的橡皮包皮上的血迹也是铁锈吗？”美方组员即无言可答。
    双方组员最后同意在十四日下午二时会晤，讨论共同向军事停战委员会提交特别报告。
     【新华社开城讯】十四日下午，第四联合观察小组双方组员会晤，对美方军事人员在非军事区内杀害并绑架朝中方面民政警察的事件，讨论共同向军事停战委员会提交特别报告。
    会晤时，朝中方面组员根据共同调查中的各种证据，要求美方将被美方军事人员劫走的朝中方面民政警察金仁焕立即交还朝中方面。美方组员仍不顾事实，无理狡赖，拒绝提出共同报告。朝中方面组员因此决定单独向军事停战委员会提出特别报告。
    朝中方面特别报告的判语说：“根据无可辩驳的事实，证明美方武装人员，为了杀害、绑架朝中方面民政警察的目的，非法越过了军事分界线，侵入朝中方面管辖的非军事区豆粟洞附近，造成了杀害和劫走朝中方面民政警察各一名的严重违反停战协定的事件。”
