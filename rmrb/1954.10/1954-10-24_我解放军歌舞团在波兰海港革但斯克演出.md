Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 22nd: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe has departed for Szczecin, another Polish seaport, after conducting performance visits in Gdańsk, a famous Polish port, for several days.

During their stay in Gdańsk, the Song and Dance Troupe performed five shows for local workers, sailors, and troops, and also sent some members to the suburbs to perform for farmers in agricultural production cooperatives. Each performance was warmly welcomed by the audience.

In Gdańsk, the Song and Dance Troupe also held get-togethers with local workers, troops, and cultural groups, and took a boat trip on the beautiful Baltic Sea with Polish sailors. The Song and Dance Troupe also visited the old city of Gdańsk, the large-scale shipyard, the naval club, and the maritime museum. In Gdańsk, the members of the Song and Dance Troupe met with Polish sailors who had returned to their homeland from the Polish merchant ship "Praca," which had been hijacked to Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and held a get-together and discussion with them. In their conversation, the sailors angrily denounced the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's piracy in hijacking merchant ships and disrupting freedom of navigation on the high seas, and stated that they would continue to appeal to the world to demand the release of the Polish crew members who are still being detained in Taiwan by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    我解放军歌舞团在波兰海港革但斯克演出
    【新华社华沙二十二日电】中国人民解放军歌舞团连日来在波兰著名港口革但斯克进行演出访问活动后，已启程前往波兰另一海港斯才新。
    歌舞团在革但斯克期间共为当地工人、海员和部队演出了五场，还派部分团员到郊区为农业生产合作社的农民演出。每次演出都受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    在革但斯克，歌舞团还同当地的工人、部队和文化团体举行了联欢并和波兰水兵们乘船游览了美丽的波罗的海。歌舞团还参观了革但斯克古老的市区，规模宏大的造船厂，海军俱乐部和航海博物馆等。歌舞团人员在革但斯克会见了从被蒋介石卖国集团劫往台湾的波兰商船“工作号”上返回祖国的波兰海员，并和他们进行了联欢和座谈。海员们在谈话中愤怒地控诉了蒋介石卖国集团劫夺商船、破坏公海航行自由的海盗行为，并表示将继续向全世界呼吁，要求释放目前仍被蒋介石卖国集团扣留在台湾的波兰船员。
