    The Great Realist Writer Fielding
    ——Commemorating the Bicentennial of Fielding's Death
  　Xiao Qian
    Henry Fielding, the great 18th-century English realist writer, is one of the four international cultural figures whose memory the World Peace Council has called on people worldwide to commemorate this year. He died in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, on October 8th, two hundred years ago. The Chinese Writers Association will hold a meeting to commemorate him later this month.
    During his short forty-seven years, he wrote more than twenty plays, ran four publications, and created four novels. George Bernard Shaw considered Fielding the greatest English dramatist from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, except for Shakespeare. The poet Byron compared his novels to "Homer in prose." For two hundred years, his works have been loved by the broad masses of people around the world, warmly praised by great writers such as Goethe, Stendhal, Belinsky, and Gorky, and listed by Marx as one of his favorite readings in his life. He was a torch of English Enlightenment realism, a brilliant banner. All this is because Fielding was true to life and took his creative career seriously. The reason why his works have been passed down through the ages is that they are written truthfully, which is inseparable from his patriotic, anti-evil, and combative outlook on life.
      I. A Life of Struggle
    Fielding lived on the eve of the Industrial Revolution in England, a time when the emerging British bourgeoisie was ruthlessly exploiting its own working people at home and actively plundering colonies abroad in order to expand its influence. When he was born (1707), the British ruling class had been fighting for ten years in a row to compete with France for European hegemony. His main period of creation (mid-18th century) was when Britain was constantly waging wars in the continent over the succession of the Austrian Queen, and in the Americas and India to compete with other imperialist countries for colonies. These wars made the British people extremely poor, while financial capitalists and factory owners became richer and richer like snowballs.
    In this society with a huge gap between the rich and the poor, "justice" was naturally entirely in the hands of landlords and the bourgeoisie. At that time, the number of prisoners in British prisons was more than in the whole of Europe. Ordinary people were sentenced to death for stealing five shillings due to hunger and cold, while the powerful and wealthy families openly engaged in corruption and malpractice. The Duke of Newcastle called "election" finding pasture for the animals he kept, and Walpole, the Prime Minister of the Whig cabinet, openly admitted that each member of Parliament had a "price tag" on his head – that is, the amount of money they spent on bribery.
    These parasites scraped money from the people and went to drink, gamble, play with women, and live an obscene and shameless life.
    Fielding was born into a declining aristocratic family, so he had the opportunity to see the corruption of his own class and taste the bitterness of poverty. When he attended the aristocratic Eton College, his family was still able to make ends meet. When he went to Leiden University in the Netherlands to study in 1728, he was in such a difficult situation that he had to drop out halfway. The following year, he faced the choice of "being a hired coachman or being a hired writer."
    From 1729, he relied on writing to make a living. He first engaged in drama. One of his early plays was about the struggle of a new writer, entitled "The Author's Farce". The protagonist, "Mr. Badluck," is a writer who runs into walls everywhere. His script cannot find a patron, he cannot pay the rent, and the landlady puts her hands on her hips and says to him: "Mr. Badluck, don't use your script to prevaricate anymore. An unscheduled script is not worth more than an uncracked lottery ticket. I never expected to recruit a poet as a tenant! ... After you move out, I will definitely write in red letters on the door: 'Poets are not for rent'!" The play also wrote about his struggle with theater managers, which reminds us of Fielding's early writing difficulties.
    All his plays were similar to satirical comedies, all targeting the hypocrisy and hypocrisy in society at that time, and the corruption and bribery in the political world for sharp and powerful criticism. "Don Quixote in England" (1734) and "Pasquin" fully exposed the ugliness of politicians' bribery. In the play "Historical Register for the Year 1736" (1737), there is a scene depicting an auction. Under realistic circumstances, the items being auctioned are "a piece of unseen cloth – political honesty, guaranteed to be enough for politicians to make a good coat, which can be worn inside and out, and can be changed at any time." (Someone bought it for five pounds.) Another piece of "fashionable patriotism" suitable for use during county elections could not find a buyer. A conscience that had been used by judges and bishops was not worth the price, and finally sold for one shilling.
    These pungent satires greatly angered the rulers. In May 1737, the government's official newspaper warned him not to discuss politics on stage. A few days later, Fielding simply printed the two most sharply written scripts into a booklet, with a "Dedication to the Public" written in front: "If nature has given me some talent for mocking sin and fraud, as long as our freedom of publication and performance exists for one day, I will definitely not be lazy, and I will definitely not be afraid to play that talent."
    The following month, the "Licensing Act," which strangled Fielding's future in dramatic writing, was passed in Parliament. It stipulated that all scripts must be submitted for review before being performed, otherwise a fine of fifty pounds would be imposed. During the debate in the House of Lords, the Earl of Chesterfield made it clear that the real cause of this decree was Fielding's plays that attacked the dark幕 of the government. This decree aroused public outrage in England. When the first officially approved play was performed in the Abbey Garden, the masses gathered to protest, and there was a commotion in front of the theater.
    After losing the stage as his position, Fielding co-founded a "The Champion" magazine with friends, and changed to using essays to attack the dark forces. At the same time, some character sketches he published on it about country gentry, pastors, fashionable ladies in the city, rogue lawyers, and cold wives all became preparations for him to write novels.
    During this period, he also studied and practiced law. Law (including the inside story of prisons) occupies a very important position in Fielding's novels. Through this profession, he observed social life more delicately and deeply.
    In 1742, his first novel, "Joseph Andrews," was published. Fielding had always loved "Don Quixote", and the subtitle of this novel was written as "Written in the Manner of Cervantes". At the same time, he also attempted to satirize Richardson's novel "Pamela," published in 1740, but in fact his achievements far exceeded these. The unforgettable image of Parson Adams in his writings is by no means derived from the Spanish knight, but a native Englishman.
    The following year, he published a "Miscellanies," which included his allegorical novel "The History of the Life of the Late Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great". In this political satire, Fielding's pen attacked the "great men" who have ruled mankind by violence throughout the ages.
    In 1749, his masterpiece "Tom Jones" was published. This is an epoch-making work in the history of English novels. Through the life of an orphan, it drew a vivid epitome of England in the mid-18th century. This "prose comic epic" was immediately warmly welcomed by the vast number of readers, and the publishers could not bind it in time, and the book was sold out in loose pages.
    His last novel, "Amelia" (1751), more centrally exposed the inside story of the British judicial world, but it lacked the bright and optimistic atmosphere of "Tom Jones". From 1748, Fielding became a magistrate in the Westminster district for an annual salary of three hundred pounds – he himself said that it was "the dirtiest money in the world." This position made him deal with criminals and robbers in London all day long, and he began to feel despair about "human nature".
    Fielding was originally very physically strong when he was young, but due to poverty and overwork, he suffered from asthma, jaundice and dropsy. In the summer of 1754, his symptoms became serious. So, he went to Portugal to recuperate according to the doctor's advice. On the way, he also wrote a "Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon".
    Soon after arriving in Lisbon, he ended his tense and combative life.
      II. What he supported, what he opposed
    When discussing satire, Fielding said that there are three things in the world that should not be satirized: first, truly good deeds – which should make us stand in awe; second, various sins – it is not enough to simply satirize them, but should be deeply hated; third, the hardships and sufferings in life – which cannot be satirized and should be sympathized with. It can be seen that Fielding had a clear and distinct understanding of what he supported and what he opposed.
    In Fielding's works, we can see everywhere his sympathy for the oppressed and harmed – especially the discrimination they suffer in the face of the law – and his deep hatred for the oppressors. In the play "Don Quixote in England", one character said: "In all countries, prisons are only for the poor. A poor man who steals five shillings from the upper class will be imprisoned, but the upper class can rob the poor by the hundreds and thousands, and they sit safely at home." In the play "Pasquin", one character satirized: "People are punished for doing bad things, but the upper class does not get punished, so they never do bad things."
    In novels, he often writes about wrongful imprisonment, such as in "Tom Jones," where a person is accused of stealing a horse. The judge does not give him a chance to defend himself, but grins like a devil and says: "Oh, you are luckier than you think, you have not only found a horse, but also found a rope." "Jonathan Wild" and "Amelia" are all shrouded in the dark shadow of prisons. He compared bailiffs to butchers and arrest warrants to butcher knives, which slaughter personal freedom.
    What Fielding hated most was the powerful who acted arbitrarily on the people. In "Jonathan Wild", he said that the actions of those rulers were more vicious than thieves and more shameless than brothel madams. In the same book, he divided mankind into those who create fruits with their own hands and those who sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. In "The Champion" magazine, he wrote: "If they can profit from it, they can cut off the heads of half of their compatriots." "Joseph Andrews" tells the story of a man who undresses his own pockets. These all show that Fielding extremely hated the exploitative behavior of harming others and benefiting oneself.
    In terms of understanding, Fielding was not yet thorough about the sources and solutions of these evils. For example, in his later years, in a pamphlet, he actually equated poverty and lax law enforcement as reasons for the prevalence of theft in London. However, we can definitely say that he sympathized with those who were oppressed, and this sympathy brought him closer to life and made his works closer to the essence of reality.
    On the creative road, Fielding insisted on starting from life. In the preface to "Joseph Andrews", he stated that "there is not a single character or action in the book that has not been through my observation and experience." But Fielding also did not agree with the "recording everything heard" style of writing without refining reality. He always put forward at the same time that a writer should personally experience, his judgment of things, and the selection of details.
      "Tom Jones" is divided into eighteen volumes, each with a preface, through which Fielding expounds his views on literature and life. In the preface to Volume IX, he proposed that the four conditions a writer should possess are: 1. Genius: he believes that it is "the ability to quickly and wisely penetrate into the true essence of things. The power to discover and analyze things." 2. Learning – refers to literary cultivation. He believes that this kind of cultivation will not only not bind a writer's talent, but also make his tools sharper. 3. "Contact with men and women of all walks of life and all classes," so as to obtain a sound knowledge of "human nature." 4. Compassion. Regarding this point, he said: "Most of the sad and touching scenes are written with tears. The same is true for writing humorous works. If I don't laugh before the reader, I will never make the reader laugh." He is referring to the authenticity of emotions.
    Among these four conditions, what he talks about most often is contact with people. In the preface to Volume XIII of the same book, he appealed to "experience":
  "Let me interact more with those who are wise, kind, and noble, but not only them, but people of all kinds: from ministers to bailiffs, from duchesses to barmaids. Only from you (experience) can I understand the posture of mankind." He also prayed: "Guide me through all the mazes and alleys of nature (referring to life itself), teach me all the secrets that vulgar eyes cannot see, and make me understand mankind more than they understand themselves."
    To familiarize yourself with life and characters in real life – this is the starting point of Fielding's creative philosophy, and the reason why his works can attract readers. He is equally familiar with the cities and villages of 18th-century England, and the upper and lower classes of society. More than forty characters appear in "Tom Jones," from nobles and gentry to gardeners and coachmen. Tom and Blifil are both children, Allworthy and Western are both squires, Thwackum and Square are both tutors, but they do not appear blurred in outline because they have the same status. They are all specific people with different appearances, temperaments, and habits. We sometimes worry about Tom and sometimes rejoice for him, precisely because he has become a living person with flesh and blood, a beating pulse, and a nose that can breathe in the minds of readers. Thackeray, the author of "Vanity Fair", praised Fielding's characters, saying: "We are just like having breakfast with them in the morning, or meeting them in the park in the afternoon." This is because his characters are shaped from life, and they can naturally jump out of the book and return to life.
    From an artistic point of view, "Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon", which he wrote at the end of his life, is not his masterpiece, but it is a precious and moving record of a great mind. It not only vividly illustrates how diligent and tireless Fielding was in writing, but he was even unwilling to put down his pen even at the moment of his illness. From the content of this travelogue, we can also feel his ardent and stubborn feelings for life and for mankind. Before setting off, when he kissed his children goodbye, he soberly realized the approach of death. His dropsy had become so serious that the sailors laughed when he boarded the ship. He sternly rebuked them for being so lacking in sympathy. Sitting on the deck and admiring the scenery of his motherland reflected in the afterglow of the setting sun, his reluctant mood is vividly portrayed on paper. All the way, he asked the coastal fishermen about the prices of various fish, and had enthusiastic conversations with the shipowners about their forty-six years of sailing experience. Under the torture of illness and the threat of death, he still felt a strong interest in everything around him, especially in people.
    Fielding's brilliant achievements in literature in his life just illustrate that only when a writer has a burning love for the people in his chest can he love life and write real and moving works.

    伟大的现实主义作家菲尔丁
    ——纪念菲尔丁逝世二百周年　　　　
  　萧乾
    英国十八世纪的伟大现实主义作家亨利·菲尔丁是世界和平理事会今年号召全世界人民纪念的国际四大文化名人之一。他在二百年前的十月八日，客死在葡萄牙京城里斯本。本月下旬，中国作家协会将集会纪念。
    在他活着的短短四十七年中间，他编写了二十几个剧本，办过四个刊物，创作了四部长篇小说。萧伯纳认为除去莎士比亚，菲尔丁是中世纪到十九世纪间英国最伟大的戏剧家。诗人拜伦把他的小说比作“散文中的荷马”。两百年来他的作品一直为全世界广大群众所热爱，受到歌德、斯汤达、别林斯基和高尔基等伟大作家的热烈推崇，并且被马克思列为他生平最喜爱的读物之一。他是英国启蒙现实主义的一把火炬，一面光辉灿烂的旗帜。这一切，都是由于菲尔丁忠实于人生，严肃地对待他的创作事业。他的作品所以流传不朽，是因为它们写得真实，而这和他那热爱人民，嫉恶如仇的战斗的人生观是分不开的。
      一、战斗的一生
    菲尔丁生活在英国工业革命的前夕，正是英国新兴资产阶级为了扩张它的声势，对内无情地剥削着本国劳动人民，对外积极掠夺殖民地的时期。他出生的时候（一七○七年），英国统治阶级为了和法兰西争夺欧洲的霸权，已经一连打了十年仗。他创作的主要时期（十八世纪中叶），正是英国在大陆上为了奥地利女王继位问题，在美洲和印度为了跟其他帝国主义国家争夺殖民地，不断地东征西讨。这些战争都使得英国老百姓贫困不堪，而金融资本家、工厂老板们则像雪球般越滚越富。
    在这个贫富悬殊的社会里，“公道”自然是完全掌握在地主和资产阶级手里。当时英国监狱里关的囚犯人数比全欧洲的还要多，老百姓为饥寒所迫偷上五个先令就处死刑，而权贵豪门则公开贪污舞弊。新堡贵族管“竞选”叫替他豢养的畜牲找草地，惠格党内阁的首相倭尔普公开承认国会里每个议员头上都各有个“价码”——就是他们在贿选时所耗用的钱数。
    这些寄生虫从人民身上刮到了钱，就去酗酒、聚赌、玩女人、过荒淫无耻的生活。
    菲尔丁出生在一个破落的贵族家庭里，因而他既有机会看到本阶级的腐烂，又尝到贫穷的滋味。他在贵族的伊顿学堂上学时，家境还勉强过得去。一七二八年他赴荷兰雷顿大学去留学时，景况困难得只好中途退学。转年他就面临“当一个雇佣的马车伕或是当一个雇佣的作家”的选择。
    从一七二九年起，他便倚靠写作来生活了。他首先从事的是戏剧。他早期有一个剧本写一个新作家的挣扎，题目是“作家的闹剧”。主人公“倒霉先生”是个到处碰壁的作家。他的剧本找不到主顾，房租交不上，房东太太就插了腰对他说：“倒霉先生，你不要再拿你的剧本来搪塞了。一个没有上演的剧本的价值不比一张没有摇过的彩票价值大。我哪里料到会招上一个诗人当房客！……你搬去以后我一定用红字在门上写着：‘诗人概不出租’！”戏里还写到他和剧场经理等的斗争，这些多少使我们摹想到菲尔丁写作初期的艰苦。
    所有他的剧本都类乎讽刺笑剧，都是针对当时社会上的浮夸虚伪、政界上贪污贿选等黑幕进行尖锐而有力的抨击。“堂·吉诃德在英国”（一七三四年）和“巴斯崑”都尽情地暴露了政客贿选的丑态。在“历史日历”（一七三七年）一剧中，有一景描写拍卖。在逼真的情景下，拍卖的物件却是“一件不经见的衣料零头——政治上的诚实，担保足够政客们作一件很好的外衣，里外可穿，两面随时都可以调换。”（有人出价五镑买去了。）另外一件适合郡选举时穿用的“时髦的爱国主义”找不到买主。一颗先后由法官和主教用过的良心也没人肯出价钱，最后以一个先令成交。
    这些辛辣的讽刺大大触怒了统治者。一七三七年五月间，政府机关报就警告他不许在舞台上议论政治。几天后，菲尔丁索性把两个写得最尖锐的剧本印成一个小册子，前面写了一篇“给公众的献词”说：“如果天赋给我一些嘲讽罪恶和欺诈的才能，只要我们的出版和演出的自由还存在一天，我就一定不会偷懒，就一定毫不惧怕地去发挥那份才能。”
    次月，扼杀菲尔丁戏剧写作前途的“检查法”就在国会通过了，它规定一切剧本上演前都必须先送审，否则课五十镑罚金。在上院辩论时，柴斯特斐尔贵族明白指出这个法令的真正起因是菲尔丁的那些攻讦政府黑幕的剧本。这法令引起了英国人民的公愤。当第一个被官方批准的戏在修道院花园上演时，群众集合起来抗议，剧院门前是一片骚动。
    失掉舞台这个阵地后，菲尔丁跟朋友合办了一个“战士”杂志，改用杂文向黑暗势力进攻。同时，他在上面发表的一些关于乡绅、牧师、城里的时髦仕女、流氓律师以及受冷的妻子等人物速写都刚好成为他写小说的准备。
    这时期，他还学习并操过律师业。法律（包括监狱中的黑幕）在菲尔丁的小说中占很重要的地位。通过这个职业，他更细腻、更深刻地观察了社会生活。
    一七四二年，他的第一部小说“约瑟·安德鲁”出版了。菲尔丁一向很喜爱“堂·吉诃德传”，这部小说的副标题上写着“拟赛万提斯而作”。同时，他在书中还企图嘲讽李查德孙在一七四○年出版的小说“帕米拉”，实际上他的成就却远远超出这些。他笔下的亚当姆斯牧师那个令人难忘的形象绝不是脱胎于西班牙骑士，而是个土生土长的英国人。
    转年，他出版了一部“杂集”，其中包括他的寓言小说“大伟人江奈生·魏尔德传”。在这部政治讽刺作品中，菲尔丁的笔锋抨击的是古今凭暴力统治人类的“伟人”。
    一七四九年，他的杰作“汤姆·琼斯”出版了。这是英国小说史上划时代的作品。它通过一个弃儿的身世替十八世纪中叶的英国绘了一幅生动的缩影。这部“散文滑稽史诗”立刻受到广大读者的热烈欢迎，出版商竟至来不及装订，书在散页状态下就销光了。
    他最后一部小说“亚米丽亚”（一七五一）更集中地暴露了英国司法界的黑幕，但是它缺乏“汤姆·琼斯”的明朗、乐观气氛。从一七四八年，菲尔丁为了一年三百镑的薪俸——他自己说，那是“世界上最肮脏的钱”，——当了西敏寺区的治安法官。这个职位使他整天和伦敦的凶犯、强盗打交道，使他对“人性”开始感到绝望。
    菲尔丁年轻时候体格本来很健壮，但是由于贫困和操劳过度，他连得了气喘、黄疸和?胀等症。一七五四年夏天，他的病症严重起来。于是，他遵照医生嘱咐去葡萄牙休养。途中，他还写了一部
  “里斯本航海日记”。
    到了里斯本不久，他就结束了他的紧张的战斗的一生。
      二、他拥护什么，反对什么
    菲尔丁在论讽刺时，说天下有三种东西不宜嘲讽：一是真正善良的行为——那应使我们肃然起敬；二是各种罪恶——仅仅讽刺它们还不够，应该深恶痛绝；三是生活中的困苦遭罹——那讽刺不得，应当寄以同情。可见菲尔丁对他拥护什么、反对什么是有着清醒、鲜明的见解的。
    在菲尔丁的作品中，我们处处可以看到他对受压迫受损害者的同情，——尤其是他们在法律面前遭到的歧视，和对压迫者的切齿痛恨。在剧本“堂吉诃德在英国”中，一个人物说：“在所有国家里，监狱都只是给穷人住的。一个穷人偷了上流人五个先令就得坐牢，可是上流人抢起穷人来成千成百，他们却安然坐在家里。”在剧本“巴斯崑”中，一个人物嘲讽说：“人们为了做坏事而受处罚，然而上流人受不到处罚，因此他们从来是不做坏事的。”
    在小说中，他时常写到冤狱，如“汤姆·琼斯”里一个人被控偷马，法官不给他辩护的机会，还魔鬼般地呲了牙说：“哦，你的运气比你想的还要好些，你不但找到了一匹马，还找到一根绞绳。”“大伟人传”和“亚米丽亚”中都幢幢地笼罩着牢狱的黑影。他把衙吏比做屠户，把拘捕状比做屠刀，它宰割的是人身自由。
    菲尔丁最痛恨的是骑在人民身上作威作福的权贵。在“大伟人传”里，他说那些统治者的行径比盗贼还凶恶，比妓院老鸨还没廉耻。在同书中，他把人类分做用自己的手来创造果实的，和那些坐享其成的。在“战士”杂志里他写道：“如果他们有利可图的话，把一半同胞的脑袋割掉他们也干得出的。”“约瑟·安德鲁”里就叙述过一个扒起自己衣袋的人。这些都说明菲尔丁对于损人利己的剥削行为是极端憎恨的。
    在认识上，菲尔丁对这些罪恶的来源和解决的办法都还不透彻，譬如他晚年在一个小册子里竟把贫穷和执法不严平列为伦敦盗风炽盛的原因。然而我们可以肯定说：他对那些受压迫的人们是同情的，这种同情使他贴近生活，使他的作品接近现实的本质。
    在创作道路上，菲尔丁是坚持从生活出发的。在“约瑟·安德鲁”的序文中，他声明“书里没有一个人物或动作不是经过我的观察和体会的。”但是菲尔丁也不赞成对现实不加提炼、“有闻必录”式的写法。他总是把一个作家应当亲自体验和他对事物的判断，以及对细节的选择同时提出来的。
      “汤姆·琼斯”共分为十八卷，每卷前面都有一篇序文，菲尔丁通过它们发挥他对文艺和人生的见解。在第九卷的序文中他提出作家应具备的四个条件是：一、天才：他认为那是“能迅速而明智地深入到事物的真实本质。能够发掘并分析事物的力量。”二、学问——指文学修养。他相信这种修养不但不会使一个作家的才能受到束缚，并且还能使他的工具更加锐利。三、“和各种行当，各个阶层的男女接触”，从而对“人性”取得健全的知识。四、同情心。关于这一点，他说：“大部分哀凄动人的景色都是挥着泪写出的。写滑稽作品也是一样。如果我不是先读者而笑，我就永远不能使读者大笑起来。”他指的是感情的真实。
    在这四个条件中，他最常谈的是和人的接触。在同书第十三卷的序文中他向“经验”呼吁说：
  “让我和那些明智、善良和高尚的人们多多往来，然而不仅是他们，而是各色各样的人物：从大臣到衙吏，从公爵夫人到女酒保。只有从你（经验）那里我才能了解人类的姿态。”他还祈求说：“引导我经历自然（指生活本身）中的一切迷津，一切曲巷幽径，把俗眼看不见的一切隐秘传授给我，使我了解人类多于他们了解自己。”
    在真实生活中间去熟悉生活和人物——这正是菲尔丁创作哲学的出发点，也是他的作品所以能吸引读者的原因。他对十八世纪英国的城市和乡村、上层和下层社会同样熟稔。“汤姆·琼斯”里有四十多个人物出现，从贵族、缙绅到看园人和马车夫。汤姆和布力非同是孩子，甄可敬和魏思顿同是乡绅，夏楚和方正同是塾师，然而他们并不因为身份相同而在轮廓上显得模糊，他们都是有着不同的相貌、脾气和习惯的具体的人。我们时而替汤姆担忧，时而替他庆幸，也正因为他在读者心目中已经成为一个有血有肉，脉搏能动，鼻子能冒气的活人。“浮华世界”的作者萨克雷称赞菲尔丁的人物说：“我们直像上午刚同他们一道吃过早饭，或者下午将同他们在公园见面一样。”这是由于他的人物是从生活中塑造出来的，它们自然也可以跳出书本，再回到生活中去。
    从艺术上看，他临终写成的“里斯本航海日记”并不是他的杰作，然而它却是一个伟大心灵的珍贵而动人的记录，它不但生动地说明了菲尔丁对写作是怎样勤劳不倦，甚至在病笃时刻还不肯放下笔。从这本游记的内容我们还可以感到他对生活、对人类的那种炽热的、执拗的感情。动身之前，当他和儿女们吻别时，他清醒地意识到死亡的逼近。他的?胀已经严重得使水手们在他登船当儿笑出声来。他严峻地责备他们不该那么缺乏同情。坐在甲板上欣赏着映在落日余晖下的祖国景物，他那种依恋不舍的心情活现在纸上。他一路向沿海渔民打听着各种鱼的价钱，跟船主热烈地攀谈着他航海四十六年来的经验。在病魔的折磨和死亡的威胁下，他对周围一切，特别对于人，依然感到浓厚的兴趣。
    菲尔丁一生在文学上辉煌的成就恰好说明：只有当一个作家在胸膛里燃烧起对人民的爱，他才能热爱生活，才能写出真实感人的作品。
