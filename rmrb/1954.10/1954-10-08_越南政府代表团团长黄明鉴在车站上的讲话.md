Dear Comrades and Friends:

    The Vietnamese Government Delegation, representing the Vietnamese government and people, came to Beijing to participate in the celebration of the 5th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We were deeply honored by the grand welcome and warm hospitality we received. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese comrades.

    During our stay in Beijing, we witnessed the great strength of the Chinese people, the love of every Chinese person for Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government, the fraternal friendship of the Chinese people towards the Vietnamese people, and the solid unity among the fraternal countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. We were deeply excited and strengthened our unparalleled confidence in our national liberation and world peace.

    Before leaving Beijing, the great capital of the Chinese people, we would like to pay our highest respects to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Government. We wish the Chinese people brilliant victories in the cause of liberating Taiwan and completing the complete unification of Chinese territory, and we wish the Chinese people to build their country even more prosperous and strong.

    Long live the unbreakable solidarity and friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people!
    Long live the victory of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
