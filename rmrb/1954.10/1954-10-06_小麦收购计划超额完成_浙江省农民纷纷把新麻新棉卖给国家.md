    Wheat Procurement Plan Exceeded
    Zhejiang Province Farmers Eagerly Sell New Hemp and New Cotton to the State
    [Our Dispatch] The procurement and requisition of wheat are progressing smoothly in various regions this year. Most areas have now completed their wheat requisition plans, and the total amount of wheat procured nationwide has exceeded the original plan. According to statistics from the Ministry of Food, as of September 25th, the total amount of wheat procured and requisitioned nationwide exceeded the original plan by 8 percent. Due to the late wheat harvest in the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and some areas of the Northwest, procurement and requisition work is still underway.
    This year, the nation has experienced a bumper wheat harvest, with total output increasing by 20.7 percent compared to last year. After being educated in the general line for the transition period, and having personally experienced the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the vast number of farmers are even more enthusiastic about paying agricultural taxes and selling surplus grain. After the wheat harvest, farmers in various regions actively paid public grain and sold their surplus grain to the state. This year, 30 million mu of wheat in 57 counties, including Heze in Shandong Province, experienced a widespread bumper harvest. Under the slogan "Increased grain production, don't forget to support national industrialization," farmers quickly sold 780 million jin of wheat to the state, 370 million jin more than they sold to the state last year. Farmers in the main wheat-producing areas – Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei – enthusiastically paid public grain and sold wheat. As of September 25th, the wheat sold and handed over to the state by farmers in these nine provinces accounted for 92.76 percent of the national wheat procurement and requisition plan. Before paying public grain and selling surplus grain, farmers in many areas, such as Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, actively dried and cleaned the wheat, and supervised and inspected each other to ensure "no bad grain leaves the village," fulfilling the guarantee of "paying good grain and selling good grain."
    [Our Dispatch] Since the end of August and the beginning of September, farmers in Zhejiang Province have been eagerly selling newly stripped hemp and newly picked cotton to the state. As of September 25th, more than 139,000 dan of new hemp had been purchased in five counties, including Hangxian, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Haining. According to statistics from seven counties (cities), including Yuyao, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Pinghu, as of September 22nd, a total of 1.27 million jin of seed cotton and 450,000 jin of ginned cotton had been purchased. The new cotton and new hemp have been processed and transported to cities to supply textile industrial production.
    Zhejiang Province is the largest hemp-producing area in the country. In order to ensure a bumper hemp harvest this year, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government signed hemp pre-purchase contracts with hemp farmers in five major hemp-producing areas, including Haining and Shaoxing, and prepaid 13.9 billion yuan in deposits, supplying more than 1.19 million jin of various fertilizers. Yao Caigen, a hemp farmer in Xucun District, Haining, used the 180,000 yuan deposit from the state to apply topdressing fertilizer to his nine mu of hemp fields, stripping an extra 100 jin of hemp per mu. Thanks to the government's assistance and farmers' efforts in cultivation, the province experienced a widespread bumper hemp harvest this year, with an average yield of 450 jin per mu. Cotton also grew well, with the ginning outturn rate of Dai character cotton generally reaching 38.9 jin, an increase of 10 percent compared to last year.
    In order to ensure the completion of this year's national procurement tasks and enable farmers to purchase necessary means of production and daily necessities after selling cotton and hemp, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government's Finance and Economics Committee and various supply and marketing cooperatives have not only established a large number of purchasing stations, warehouses, and processing plants in various regions, and trained and deployed acceptance personnel and technical guidance cadres, but have also organized a large number of fertilizers, cloth, and other goods to be transported to cotton and hemp producing areas for supply.

    小麦收购计划超额完成
    浙江省农民纷纷把新麻新棉卖给国家
    【本报讯】今年各地收购和征收小麦的工作进展顺利，现在大部地区征收小麦计划已经完成，全国收购小麦数量超过了原订计划。据粮食部统计，到九月二十五日止，全国收购和征收小麦的总数，超过原计划百分之八。东北、内蒙古和西北一部分地区因小麦收获迟，收购和征收工作目前仍在进行。
    今年全国小麦丰收，总产量比去年增加百分之二十点七。广大农民受到过渡时期总路线的教育，亲身体会到粮食统购统销的好处以后，缴纳农业税和出售余粮的积极性更加提高。各地农民在小麦收获以后，都积极缴纳公粮，并把余粮卖给国家。山东省菏泽等五十七个县的三千万亩小麦今年普遍丰收，农民们在“多打粮食不忘支援国家工业化”的口号下，迅速卖给国家七亿八千万斤小麦，比去年卖给国家的小麦多三亿七千万斤。主要产麦区——河南、山东、河北、陕西、江苏、安徽、山西、四川、湖北等九省的农民，缴纳公粮和出售小麦非常踊跃，到九月二十五日止，这九个省的农民卖给和缴给国家的小麦达到全国收购和征收小麦计划的百分之九十二点七六。陕西省泾阳县等许多地区的农民在缴公粮和卖余粮以前，都积极把小麦晒干、扬净，并彼此督促检查，作到“坏粮不出村”，实现了“缴好粮，卖好粮”的保证。
   【本报讯】从八月底九月初以来，浙江省农民纷纷把新剥的络麻和新摘的棉花卖给国家。到九月二十五日为止，杭县、萧山、绍兴、海宁等五个县，已收购新麻十三万九千多担。另据余姚、萧山、绍兴、平湖等七县（市）九月二十二日的统计，共已收购籽棉一百二十七万斤，皮棉四十五万斤。新棉、新麻经过加工后已运往城市供应纺织工业生产。
    浙江省是全国最大的产麻区。浙江省人民政府为了保证今年络麻丰产，曾在海宁、绍兴等五个主要麻区，和麻农签订了络麻预购合同，并预付定金一百三十九亿元，供应各种肥料一百十九万多斤。海宁许村区麻农姚才根，拿了国家十八万元定金在九亩麻田里施了追肥，每亩多剥了一百斤络麻。由于政府的帮助和农民努力培育，今年全省络麻普遍丰收，每亩平均产量达四百五十斤。棉花也生长良好，衣分率岱字棉一般达到三十八点九斤，比去年提高一成。
    浙江省人民政府财政经济委员会和各供销合作社等，为了保证完成今年国家的收购任务，并使农民出售棉麻后能买到必要的生产资料和生活资料，除在各地增设大批收购站、仓库和加工厂，训练和调配了验收人员和技术指导干部外，并组织大批肥料、布匹等运往棉、麻区进行供应。
