The national petroleum industry overfulfilled the state production plan for September. The total industrial output value exceeded the plan by 8%; the main products such as crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil all exceeded the plan by 1.4% to 24.1%.

Many oil fields and mines reported production successes in September. The Northwest Yanchang Oil Mine completed its annual crude oil production plan ahead of schedule on September 8th; the Northwest Yumen Oil Mine completed its annual profit delivery plan ahead of schedule at the end of September.

Currently, on the basis of overfulfilling the plan, the various oil fields have successively put forward new guarantees. The Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 3 guarantees to increase production by more than 80 billion yuan of wealth by the end of the year; the activated carbon team of the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 4 guarantees to complete the annual production increase and conservation plan two months ahead of schedule; the fourth oil extraction team of the Northwest Yumen Oil Mine guarantees to increase production by 500 tons of crude oil; the Northwest Yanchang Oil Mine is striving to overfulfill the annual crude oil production plan by 53.4%.

The various oil fields are actively carrying out winter construction preparation work. From September, the Yumen Oil Mine organized a truck tanker insulation engineering team to carry out insulation construction in Jiuquan, and mobilized the families of employees and the clothing department of the mining area trading company to rush to make woolen quilts. By the end of September, the insulation work of 200 trucks has been completed, which has a great effect on the eastward transportation of crude oil and the support of the production of various oil factories in the Northeast.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 18th. The workers of the Fushun Mining Bureau have been striving to reduce the production cost of coal, and have fulfilled the state profit delivery plan month by month from January to September, and have delivered more than 27 billion yuan in profits. This year, when the production conditions were the best, the cost of coal in the Fushun Mining Bureau was 5.19% lower than the national cost target; under unfavorable production conditions, the workers also strived to ensure that the national cost target was met.

In addition to continuing to increase the recovery rate of pit props and saving gunpowder, the Fushun Mining Bureau mainly focused on improving labor productivity this year to strive for lower coal costs. Many improvements have been made to unreasonable places that hinder production. For example, a transportation roadway was added to the deep pit of the open-pit mine with a small inclined shaft lifting capacity, and the old wellbore of the Longfeng Mine has also been utilized. These improvements have increased the utilization rate of coal mining equipment in the Fushun Mining Bureau from 37% to about 40%. The workers also actively exploited the potential of the equipment. After studying the power load of the electric shovel, the workers operating the electric shovel changed the bucket of the electric shovel from 3.06 cubic meters to 3.83 cubic meters, which greatly exploited the potential of the electric shovel equipment and increased the shovel coal efficiency by nearly one time.

The labor productivity of the workers in the Fushun Mining Bureau is gradually increasing. Last year, an average worker could only mine 1 ton and 130 kilograms of coal per day; in the second quarter of this year, each worker could mine an average of 1 ton and 206 kilograms of coal per day, and in September, a worker mined an average of 1 ton and 288 kilograms.

The Fushun Mining Bureau has also paid attention to saving in terms of office expenses this year. The value saved in office desks and work clothes alone is 2 billion yuan.

    全国石油工业超额完成上月计划
    抚顺矿务局一至九月份上缴利润计划按月完成
    【本报讯】全国石油工业超额完成了九月份的国家生产计划。工业总产值超过计划百分之八；原油、汽油、煤油、柴油等主要产品都超过计划百分之一点四到百分之二十四点一。
    许多石油厂矿都在九月份内先后传出了生产捷报。西北延长油矿已在九月八日提前完成了今年全年的原油生产计划；西北玉门油矿已在九月底提前完成了今年全年的上缴利润计划。
    目前，各石油厂在超额完成计划的基础上纷纷提出了新的保证。东北石油三厂保证到年底为止增产八百亿元以上的财富；东北石油四厂活性炭班保证提前二个月完成全年增产节约计划；西北玉门油矿第四采油队保证增产五百吨原油；西北延长油矿正在为超额完成全年原油生产计划的百分之五十三点四而努力。
    各石油厂正积极进行冬季施工准备工作。玉门油矿九月份起组织了卡车油罐保温工程队，在酒泉进行保温施工，并动员职工家属和矿区贸易公司缝衣部赶制羊毛被子，到九月底已经完成二百辆卡车的保温工作，这对原油东运和支援东北各石油厂的生产有着很大的作用。
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】抚顺矿务局职工因为努力降低煤的生产成本，一月到九月份都按月完成了国家上缴利润计划，并多上缴利润二百七十多亿元。今年，抚顺矿务局在生产条件最好的时候，煤的成本曾低于国家的成本指标百分之五点一九；在生产条件不好的情况下，职工们也努力保证达到国家的成本指标。
    抚顺矿务局今年除了继续提高坑木回收率、节省火药外，主要从提高劳动生产率着手，来争取煤的成本降低。阻碍生产的不合理的地方已作了许多改进，如斜井提升能力小的露天矿深部坑，就增掘了一条运输巷道，龙凤矿的旧井筒也已加以利用。这些改进，使抚顺矿务局的采煤设备利用率由百分之三十七提高到百分之四十左右。职工们并积极发挥设备潜力，操作电铲的工人在研究了电铲的动力负荷后，将电铲的勺头由三点零六立方公尺改成三点八三立方公尺，使电铲设备潜力大大发挥，铲煤效率提高将近一倍。
    抚顺矿务局职工的劳动生产率是逐步提高的，去年平均一个工人每日只能采一吨一百三十公斤煤；今年第二季度，每个工人平均每日能采煤一吨二百零六公斤，到九月份一个工人就平均采一吨二百八十八公斤。
    抚顺矿务局今年在办公用费方面也注意了节约。仅办公桌和工作服等方面节约的价值就有二十亿元。
