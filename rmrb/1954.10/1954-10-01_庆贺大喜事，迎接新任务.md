Celebrating Great Achievements, Embracing New Tasks
Huang Yanpei

Today—October 1, 1954, is the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is our country's greatest festival. This year, today, the whole country is celebrating very enthusiastically. I believe that in the future, it will be more enthusiastic year by year.

Why do the people of the whole country cherish this day so much? Because it marks the end of the painful and dark days of the Chinese people, the end of the long-term rule of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and the beginning of a new era in Chinese history.

In just five short years, the achievements and victories in various aspects can be seen from Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress and the supplementary speeches made by responsible comrades of relevant government departments. Anyone who has seen these reports can only feel excited and moved.

Everyone sees that the ancient and backward China, under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, is clearing away the dirt left over from thousands of years of history on an unprecedented scale and at an unprecedented speed. It has achieved unprecedented achievements and victories in internal affairs, foreign affairs, military affairs, politics, economy, and culture, and is moving towards a prosperous and happy socialist society.

Everyone sees that a semi-colonial country that has suffered aggression and oppression from imperialists for more than a century now has a high prestige on the world political stage. It has joined the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to become a bulwark for defending world peace.

It has fundamentally changed the lives and history of 600 million Chinese people. It has played and will continue to play a huge role in the history and destiny of people all over the world.

On the basis of these great achievements already made in our country, the First Session of the First National People's Congress was held a few days ago. Its task was successfully completed: the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been adopted, and new national leading staff have been elected. This constitution and the new national leading staff elected by us will lead 600 million Chinese people to greater victories and a brighter future. Isn't this a great happy event!

However, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China": "This does not mean that after the Constitution is promulgated, any provisions stipulated in the Constitution will be realized naturally. ...After the Constitution is promulgated, phenomena that violate the Constitution will not disappear automatically. ...The Constitution stipulates that our country should establish a socialist society. This certainly does not mean that a socialist society is already a ready-made thing, nor does it mean that we can sit and wait for it to come. We still have a long way to go, and there will inevitably be difficulties and twists and turns on this road, and it will never be smooth sailing."

Indeed, we are facing a very serious and urgent matter:

Under the instigation and assistance of the American aggressor group, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, based in Taiwan, is increasingly rampant in attacking our coastal islands, bombing our coastal cities, plundering our coastal fishermen, robbing and detaining our merchant ships and ships trading with our country, and sending special agents to sneak into the mainland to carry out sabotage activities. This traitorous clique has recently intensified its efforts to plunder the people's wealth in Taiwan, reorganize its military forces, clamor for an attack on the mainland, and deliberately provoke a world war.

These facts clearly tell us that if Taiwan is not liberated for one day, our country's territory will not be complete for one day, our country's peaceful construction environment will not be peaceful for one day, and peace in the Far East and the world will not be guaranteed for one day.

Therefore, on the day of celebrating our great festival, the people of the whole country have a feeling: we must not allow the enemy to destroy our happy life; we must not tolerate our great motherland's sacred territory being occupied by our enemies. To celebrate our great festival, we must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen our work in all aspects, and strive to complete the liberation of Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

At the same time, on the day of celebrating our great festival, I also ask members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and friends in the industrial and commercial circles to pay attention to several things:

First, our Constitution stipulates that "the People's Republic of China relies on state organs and social forces to gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and establish a socialist society through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation." China's transition to a socialist society is an inevitable trend of social development, a common aspiration of the people of the whole country, and an unstoppable force. However, our country's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce "will take a considerable period of time and will be gradually realized through various forms of state capitalism. We will allow capitalists a necessary time to gradually accept transformation under the leadership of the state and the working class." (Liu Shaoqi: "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China") This shows that as long as private industrialists and businessmen "are willing to accept socialist transformation and do not violate the law or damage the property of the people, then they will receive the care of the state, and their future life and work will be properly arranged, and their political rights will not be deprived." (Quotation from the same report)

I ask members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and friends in the industrial and commercial circles to be sure to recognize this truth and be sure to follow this bright road. You must not have "any illegal acts that endanger the common interests, disrupt the social economic order, and undermine the national economic plan."

Second, the state's transformation of capitalist industry and commerce will go through various different forms of state capitalism. The transformation of capitalist industry will mainly go through the advanced form of state capitalism—joint state-private ownership. Years of experience have proved that the form of joint state-private ownership is both convenient for transforming the original enterprises in accordance with the management policies and management principles of socialist enterprises, and conducive to the education and transformation of bourgeois elements. The state's transformation of capitalist commerce will generally be carried out industry by industry. Appropriate measures will be taken for wholesalers and retailers in these transformed industries, and appropriate arrangements will be made for them.

I ask members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and friends in the industrial and commercial circles, on the day of celebrating our great festival, to make great determination, and those enterprises that have not yet embarked on the track of state capitalism should create conditions to transfer their enterprises to different forms of state capitalism according to the needs of the state; those who have already embarked on the intermediate form of state capitalism should actively prepare conditions and develop to the advanced form of state capitalism under the leadership of the government; those who have already embarked on the advanced form of state capitalism should be dutiful and responsible, and contribute their greatest strength. And constantly strive to study, improve their political consciousness, and cultivate their socialist ideology and labor viewpoint, so as to gradually transform themselves into new people who are free from the life of exploitation.

Third, we must not shy away from the fact that at present, some private industrialists and businessmen still have concerns, hesitations, passivity, and impatience in their thinking about the state's policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation. In actual actions, the industrial sector still cannot fully complete tasks according to quality, quantity, and time. Some still have serious phenomena of cutting corners. In the commercial sector, the situation of not complying with market management and various dishonest business styles has not yet been changed as it should be. In terms of taxation, the scope of tax evasion is still quite wide. A small number of business households still have negative behaviors such as withdrawing funds, eating and drinking wastefully. Members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and advanced friends in the industrial and commercial circles must take responsibility and fight against these illegal behaviors that exist among industrialists and businessmen. We must help, supervise, and criticize each other in order to achieve common progress.

In order to implement the Constitution, in order to liberate Taiwan, and in order to complete the historic task of the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, on the day when we jointly celebrate the great festival of the country, I am willing to work together with members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, friends in the industrial and commercial circles, and the people of the whole country. We remember the conclusion of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report: "The significance of the Constitution is great, and the tasks entrusted to us by the Constitution are especially great. Only through arduous struggle and tenacious work, through continuous efforts in learning, and overcoming the various difficulties that stand in our way, can we achieve our goals."

    庆贺大喜事，迎接新任务
    黄炎培
    今天——一九五四年十月一日是中华人民共和国成立五周年纪念日。是我们国家最伟大的节日。今年今日，全国庆祝很热烈了。我相信今后将一年比一年地热烈。
    为什么全国人民这样地珍贵这一天呢？因为它标志着中国人民痛苦黑暗的日子的结束，标志着封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本主义在中国长期统治的结束，标志着中国人民历史的新纪元。
    短短的五年，各方面的成就和胜利，从周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告和政府有关部门负责同志的补充发言中间，都可以看得到。看到了这些报告的人，只有兴奋，只有感动。
    每个人都看到：古老的落后的中国，正在中国共产党和毛泽东主席英明正确领导下，以史无前例的规模和速度，廓清了几千年历史上遗留下来的污垢，在内政、外交、军事、政治、经济、文化各方面，取得了空前的成就和胜利，而且正向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会前途迈进。
    每个人都看到：百余年来受尽了帝国主义者侵略和压迫的半殖民地的国家，现在已在世界政治舞台上有了很高的威望。它已经同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家一起，成为保卫世界和平的堡垒。
    它使六万万中国人民的生活和历史，起了根本的变化。它对全世界人民的历史和命运，已经起着并将继续起着巨大的作用。
    在我们国家已经取得这些伟大成就的基础上，就在前几天召开了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议。它的任务胜利完成了：已经通过了中华人民共和国宪法，已经选举了新的国家领导工作人员。这个宪法和我们选举出来新的国家领导工作人员，将领导六万万中国人民走向更大的胜利和更光明的前途。这还不是一件大喜事么！
    但是，正如刘少奇同志在“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”中所指出：“这并不是说，宪法颁布以后，宪法所规定的任何条文就都会自然而然地实现起来。……在宪法颁布以后，违反宪法规定的现象并不会自行消灭，……宪法规定我们的国家要建立社会主义社会，这当然不是说社会主义社会已经是现成的东西，也不是说我们可以坐着等它来到。我们面前还有遥远的道路，在这条道路上必然会有艰难，有曲折，绝对不会是一帆风顺的”。
    的确，我们面前正摆着一件很严重很急迫的事情：
    蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略集团的指使和援助下，以台湾为基地，日益猖獗地袭击我们沿海的岛屿，轰炸我们沿海的城市，劫掠我们沿海的渔民，打劫和扣留我们的商船和跟我国通商的船舶，并派遣特务潜入大陆进行破坏活动。这个卖国集团最近更在台湾加紧搜括人民财富，整编军事力量，叫嚣进攻大陆，并蓄意挑起世界战争。
    这些事实明白地告诉我们，台湾一天不解放，我国的领土就一天不完整，我国的和平建设环境就一天得不到安宁，远东和世界的和平就一天得不到保障。
    因此，在庆祝我们伟大节日的今天，全国人民都有一种心情：我们决不能允许敌人来破坏我们的幸福生活；我们决不能容忍我们伟大祖国神圣的领土为我们的敌人所盘踞。为庆祝我们伟大的节日，我们一定要更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，从各方面加强工作为完成解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗。
    同时，在庆祝我们伟大节日的今天，我还要求民建会员和工商界朋友们注意几桩事：
    第一，我们的宪法规定着，“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”中国的一定要过渡到社会主义社会，是社会发展的必然趋势，是全国人民的共同愿望，是任何力量所不能阻挡的。但是我们国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，“将经过一个相当长的时间，并通过各种不同形式的国家资本主义来逐步实现。我们将让资本家们有一个必要的时间在国家和工人阶级的领导下逐步接受改造”。（刘少奇：
  “关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”）这就说明私营工商业者只要“愿意接受社会主义改造，不违法，不破坏人民的财产，那么，他将得到国家的照顾，将来的生活和工作将得到适当的安排，他的政治权利也不会被剥夺”。（引语见同上报告）
    我要求民建会员和工商界的朋友们一定要认清这个道理，一定要顺着这条光明大道。千万不能有“危害共同利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为”。
    第二，国家对资本主义工商业的改造，要经过国家资本主义的各种不同的形式，对资本主义工业主要将经过国家资本主义的高级形式——公私合营来进行。几年来的经验证明，公私合营的形式既便于按照社会主义企业的经营方针和管理原则来改造原有企业，也有利于对资产阶级分子的教育和改造。国家对资本主义商业的改造，一般将逐行逐业来进行。对于这些被改造的行业的批发商和零售商都将采取适当措施，给以适当安排。
    我要求民建会员和工商界的朋友们，在庆祝我们伟大节日的今天，下大决心，凡是企业，还没有走上国家资本主义轨道的，应该创造条件，根据国家需要，把企业转上不同形式的国家资本主义轨道上去；凡是已经走上国家资本主义中级形式的，应该积极准备条件，在政府的领导下向国家资本主义高级形式发展；凡是已走上国家资本主义高级形式的，应该守职尽责，贡献自己最大的力量。并不断努力学习，提高自己的政治觉悟，培养自己的社会主义思想和劳动观点，以便逐渐改造自己成为脱离剥削生活的新人。
    第三，我们勿庸讳言，目前还有些私营工商业者，对国家的利用、限制和改造政策，在思想上存在着顾虑、彷徨、消极、急躁的情绪。在实际行动上，工业方面还不能完全做到按质、按量、按时来完成任务。有些还有严重地偷工减料现象。在商业方面，不服从市场管理的情况以及各种不老实的经营作风，也还没有做到应有的改变。在纳税方面，偷漏面还是相当的广。少数企业户还有抽逃资金，吃喝浪费的消极行为。民建会员和先进的工商界的朋友们，一定要负起责任，对存在于工商业者中间的这些不法行为作斗争。要彼此相互帮助，督促，批评，以求得共同的进步。
    为了实施宪法，为了解放台湾，为了完成国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造这历史性任务，在我们共同庆祝国家伟大节日的今天，我愿意同民建会员、工商界朋友和全国人民共同努力。我们记着刘少奇同志报告的结论：“宪法的意义是伟大的，宪法交给我们的任务尤其伟大。我们只有经过艰苦的奋斗和顽强的工作，经过不断的努力的学习，克服横在我们面前的种种困难，才能达到我们的目的”。
