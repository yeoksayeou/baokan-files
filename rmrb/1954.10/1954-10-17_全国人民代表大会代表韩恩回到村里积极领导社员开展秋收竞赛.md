    National People's Congress representative Han En returned to Bao'an Village in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, on the 6th, conveyed to all commune members the various reports and resolutions of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, and actively led the whole commune to launch an autumn harvest competition.
    On the morning of the day Han En returned to Bao'an Village, he went to the fields with other village cadres to inspect the crops of the production cooperative. They saw that more than 70 hectares of rice had fully matured, but the harvesting progress was still slow. After returning from the fields, Han En listened to the reports from the production team leaders and discussed with other village cadres, deciding to convene a management committee meeting of the agricultural production cooperative that evening. At the meeting, Han En introduced the circumstances of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, explaining the great significance of seizing the current autumn harvest to increase production and save grain for supporting the liberation of Taiwan and national construction. The committee members enthusiastically discussed the matter at the meeting, all agreeing that efforts should be concentrated on the autumn harvest and strive to increase grain production.
    The next morning, Han En took the lead in harvesting rice in the fields. Each production team held meetings in the fields to discuss the resolutions of the cooperative management committee. On this day, the number of male and female commune members harvesting rice in the fields nearly doubled compared to before. Han En and the production team leaders and committee members, while harvesting rice, promoted the great achievements of the First Session of the National People's Congress to the commune members, enhancing their confidence in increasing production and saving 50 kilograms of grain per hectare. On the evening of September 8th, a commune member meeting was held, and Han En again conveyed the situation of the National People's Congress meeting. The election of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's opening speech were particularly inspiring. The commune member meeting decided to mobilize all male and female members of the commune to actively participate in the autumn harvest, strive to produce more grain, and prepare to absorb nearly a hundred new commune member households after the autumn harvest. Currently, the four production teams of the agricultural production cooperative have launched an autumn harvest competition. The number of commune members participating in the autumn harvest on the 8th more than doubled compared to the 6th. Forty-two female commune members have already gone to the fields to harvest. Some commune members are even rushing to harvest rice under the moonlight. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国人民代表大会代表韩恩回到村里积极领导社员开展秋收竞赛
    全国人民代表大会代表韩恩在六日回到吉林省蛟河县保安村，向全体社员传达了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的各项报告和决议，便积极领导全社展开秋收竞赛。
    韩恩回到保安村的当天早晨，就和其他村干部一块下地查看生产合作社的庄稼，他们看到七十多垧水稻已完全成熟，但是收割的进度还慢。韩恩从地里回来，听了各生产队长的情况汇报，并和其他村干部商量，决定当天晚上召开农业生产合作社管理委员会会议。韩恩在会上介绍了全国人民代表大会第一次会议召开的情形，说明抓紧当前秋收多增产节约粮食对支援解放台湾和国家建设的重大意义。各委员在会上热烈展开讨论，都认为应集中力量进行秋收，努力争取增产粮食。
    第二天清晨，韩恩就带头下地割稻。各生产队都在地里开会讨论了合作社管理委员会的决议。这一天，下地割稻的男女社员比以前增加将近一倍。韩恩和各生产队的队长、委员们，一边割稻一边向社员们宣传全国人民代表大会第一次会议的伟大成就，提高了社员们在每垧地上增产节约一百斤粮食的信心。九月八日晚上，召开了社员大会，韩恩在会上又传达了全国人民代表大会会议的情况。毛主席的当选和毛主席的开幕词特别振奋人心。社员大会决定发动全社男女积极参加秋收，争取多打粮食，并准备秋收后吸收近百户新社员。现在，农业生产合作社的四个生产队已展开秋收竞赛。八日参加秋收的社员比六日又增加一倍多。女社员下地收割的已有四十二名。有的社员还在月夜下抢割稻子。　（新华社）
