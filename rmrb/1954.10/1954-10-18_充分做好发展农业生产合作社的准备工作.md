    Fully Prepare for the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Zhang Junqing, Secretary of the CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee
    A situation of great development of agricultural production cooperatives is taking shape. In Xinxiang Prefecture, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations has accounted for more than 75% of the total number of households this summer. In addition to the 953 old cooperatives established before the summer, about 1,500 agricultural production cooperatives will have been built or will be built this autumn (the total number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives will account for more than 10% of the total number of households). According to incomplete statistics, more than 80,000 households (accounting for more than 12% of the total number of households) have requested to build cooperatives this winter. It is estimated that this winter and next spring, the number of farmers participating in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations will account for about 85% of the total number of households; the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives will reach about 30% of the total number of households, about 10% of the townships will basically realize cooperation, and a small number of districts will also basically realize cooperation.
    The development of agricultural production cooperatives will inevitably drive and demand the development of supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives; the development of agricultural cooperation will also put forward new requirements for agricultural production technology reform; and this will also require strengthening the leadership of state-owned local industries and handicrafts, and developing handicraft cooperatives in order to supply more means of production to mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The development of various cooperative economies in rural areas will inevitably further restrict the exploitation activities of rural rich peasants, usurers, and speculators; therefore, it will inevitably cause resistance and sabotage to the cooperative movement by urban and rural capitalist elements, and the contradictory struggle between socialist and capitalist factors in rural areas will inevitably become more acute. The development of the rural cooperative movement requires a greater and corresponding improvement in the leadership level of cadres, and at the same time requires continuing to conduct in-depth education on the Party's general line and the principles, policies, and methods of agricultural cooperation among the broad masses of peasants, so as to further raise the socialist consciousness of the peasants.
    These situations show that with the arrival of the new situation of the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, especially agricultural production cooperatives, many new and complex tasks and problems have been brought about. This requires the correct and strong leadership of the Party, and continuing to strengthen preparations from all aspects to meet the arrival of this situation. If we fail to see this new situation, or simply regard it as merely the development of the number of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and fail to see the multi-faceted changes in rural society, politics, and economy caused by this development, it will make the leadership lag behind the movement and be in a state of being overwhelmed.
    In order to meet the great development of agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest, various places in the Xinxiang area have made a lot of preparations since this summer, such as implementing the Party's guiding principles in rural work, formulating development plans for agricultural production cooperation this winter and next spring, concentrating efforts to consolidate the organizations of existing cooperatives, strengthening the leadership of mutual aid teams, and selecting and training key personnel for building cooperatives, etc. However, compared with the requirements for the development of agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest, the preparations that have been made are still insufficient or very insufficient. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the preparations for the development of agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest. According to the situation and experience of Xinxiang Prefecture, it is necessary to start from the following aspects:
    First, continue to resolutely and conscientiously implement the Party's guiding principles in rural work, further shift the Party's work to focus on mutual aid and cooperation, and earnestly realize the requirements of the Party committee secretary being responsible and the entire Party taking action; at the same time, it is necessary to correctly implement the Party's class line in rural work.
    It should be admitted that since the Party Central Committee put forward the shift of the focus of the Party's work in rural areas to mutual aid and cooperation, the Party organizations in the Xinxiang area have implemented this instruction and made achievements. However, it is still not enough, and in some places it is still very insufficient. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects:
    First of all, some comrades have not truly understood the principle that rural work must focus on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and do not understand that developing agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation is the path to socialist transformation of agriculture. In practical work, the so-called "contradiction between developing production and developing mutual aid and cooperation" and the phenomenon of unclear center and average use of power often occur. Although some Party committee secretaries have started to manage mutual aid and cooperation, they do not manage enough, nor have they seriously organized the district committee and township branch to lead agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. In some places, the phenomenon of a few people running the cooperatives and most people watching or ignoring them still exists, the phenomenon of township branches not seriously leading agricultural production cooperatives is still quite common, and the phenomenon of some teams and cooperatives being unattended also exists.
    Secondly, in practical work, some comrades set the development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation against carrying out other socialist transformation work and conducting socialist education among peasants; instead of relying on and passing through mutual aid and cooperation organizations when carrying out other socialist transformation work and conducting extensive and in-depth socialist education among peasants, and promoting the consolidation and development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations by realizing other socialist transformation tasks.
    Thirdly, some departments related to rural work have not yet closely combined their own business work with agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and have not made their business work serve the development and consolidation of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, and relied on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to do a good job in business work, but have disengaged departmental business from agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, "unable to connect".
    In the implementation of the Party's class line in rural work, there are also biases and shortcomings. A part of Party members do not see (or do not actually see even if they say it) the intensification and complexity of the rural class struggle in the process of socialist transformation, neglecting not only the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, but also the resistance and sabotage activities of rich peasants and urban and rural capitalist elements to rural cooperation, and even less see the hidden and transformed sabotage activities, thus being in a state of paralysis and unclearness. In the establishment of the economic and political alliance between poor peasants and middle peasants, on the one hand, some comrades despise the active role of poor peasants (including new middle peasants) in socialist construction, do not pay attention to relying on poor peasants, do not pay attention to establishing and consolidating the advantages of poor peasants, and exclude poor peasants and make them suffer in the development of mutual aid teams and cooperatives; on the other hand, some comrades ignore the current status of middle peasants in rural areas and their role in developing production, do not pay attention to uniting middle peasants, and damage the interests of middle peasants in mutual aid and cooperation.
    If the above-mentioned situations are not changed, it will not only be unfavorable to consolidate the existing agricultural production cooperatives, but also be unfavorable to the great development of agricultural production cooperatives.
    At present, continuing to implement the Party's guiding principles in rural areas, realizing the requirements of the Party committee secretary being responsible and the entire Party taking action, and correctly implementing the Party's class line in rural work, is not only a problem of that level of Party organization, but also a comprehensive leadership problem including the Party organizations of the prefectural committee, county committee, district committee, township branch, and various departments related to rural work under the leadership of the Party. This is the requirement put forward by the new situation of the great development of agricultural production cooperatives. If we ignore the further shift of the work of the district committee and township branch to focus on mutual aid and cooperation, the large number of developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations (especially agricultural production cooperatives) will lose the Party's specific and direct leadership, and it will be difficult to guarantee the realization of the Party's mutual aid and cooperation principles and policies.
    How to solve this problem? First of all, it is necessary to continue to conduct education on the Party's general line in the transition period, continue to organize the study of the two resolutions of the CPC Central Committee on mutual aid and cooperation, improve the understanding of cadres and Party members at all levels on the Party's mutual aid and cooperation theory, line, and policies, summarize successful experiences, criticize various erroneous views that ignore agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and use practical examples to illustrate the consistency of agricultural production increase and mutual aid and cooperation, the consistency of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and various socialist transformation tasks; and it is necessary to make specific organization and arrangements according to different tasks in different periods and the business of different departments, so that they are truly and not formally combined. To this end, it is necessary to continuously conduct ideological education in the Party representative meetings, Party activists meetings, and cadre meetings that arrange various tasks, and properly arrange work. At the same time, in order to solve this problem more systematically, district and township cadres can be concentrated for short-term training in rotation according to possible conditions. Secondly, leading comrades of Party committees at all levels should take the lead, lead the vast number of cadres, especially district and township cadres, to go deep into the cooperatives, understand, learn, and study various specific problems, policies, and experiences in building and running cooperatives. At the same time, cadres with experience in building and running cooperatives should be organized in a planned way to help cadres without or lacking experience in building and running cooperatives by adopting the method of taking apprentices. Giving play to the role of the mutual aid and cooperation network is also an effective way to educate cadres with practical experience. In the case that there are still many leading comrades who lack direct experience in building and running cooperatives, it is of great importance for leading comrades to personally participate in the work of building and running cooperatives in order to obtain perceptual knowledge and improve their leadership level. Thirdly, quickly establish and strengthen the rural work departments of the prefectural and county committees, so that they can become powerful assistants to the Party committees; urge the departments related to rural work such as agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, state-owned economy, and supply and marketing cooperatives to formulate plans for serving agricultural production and promoting agricultural cooperation according to the Party's plans for consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperation, especially agricultural production cooperatives, and regularly check the implementation of the plans in order to unify and organize the forces of all parties to promote agricultural cooperation. Fourthly, educate the vast number of Party members and Youth League members in rural areas to raise their socialist consciousness, learn the principles, policies, steps, and methods of cooperation, strive to run the cooperatives and teams well, and play a leading role in the cooperatives and teams. Fifthly, in order to implement the Party's guiding principles and class line in rural work, it is necessary to continue to conduct criticism and self-criticism among Party member cadres at all levels in light of the specific ideological situation within the Party, and eliminate capitalist ideology.
    Second, effectively run the existing agricultural production cooperatives, earnestly summarize the experience of building and running cooperatives, use the specific superiority of the existing cooperatives to attract more farmers to take the road of cooperation, and use the experience of running the existing cooperatives well to arm cadres, Party members, and activists, making it the experience of the entire Party and the broad masses.
    Doing a good job in the autumn harvest distribution has a decisive role in consolidating the existing cooperatives and promoting production. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen leadership to ensure that the income distribution work is carried out correctly and smoothly. Income distribution work is a good time to check the quality of the cooperatives from the results of production and summarize the experience and lessons. After the autumn harvest distribution, the work of the cooperatives and their experience and lessons should be carefully checked and summarized in order to further improve the understanding of cooperative members on taking the road of cooperation, further explore the potential for increasing production, find the key to increasing production, improve business management, labor organization, evaluation of work and calculation of points, improve labor productivity, and formulate current production and winter production plans. At the same time, the experience of running cooperatives and the superiority of cooperatives can also be used to educate cadres and the masses outside the cooperatives.
    A major issue in building cooperatives is how to deal with the land, livestock, and farm tools of cooperative members when building cooperatives. Therefore, it is of extreme importance to seriously summarize the experience and problems of the existing cooperatives in this regard, as well as the different methods of dealing with these problems in different regions. In order to prepare for building cooperatives in the autumn, the Xinxiang area organized 21 teams this summer to specifically check and summarize the experience in this regard, and found many problems. After discussion and research, it played a great role in building cooperatives in the autumn.
    In places where autumn cooperatives have been built, the new experience of building autumn cooperatives should be seriously summarized, which has a more direct and greater role in building cooperatives after autumn.
    Third, strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams, improve and develop mutual aid teams according to the conditions of different regions, earnestly help the existing teams (mainly perennial teams) do a good job in production, improve the organization of labor and the methods of evaluating work and calculating points, and cultivate key personnel.
    In places where there are conditions for developing perennial teams, efforts should be made to help temporary teams transform into perennial teams; in places where the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation is weak, temporary and perennial mutual aid teams should be actively developed according to the needs of production and the requirements of the masses to prepare conditions for building cooperatives in the future.
    Among the activists of the existing mutual aid teams, key personnel for building cooperatives should be selected and cultivated according to the conditions of being upright, good at contacting the masses, having management ability, and having production knowledge. Accountants and technicians should be selected and cultivated. Methods such as establishing contacts with nearby cooperatives, organizing visits, holding representative meetings of mutual aid and cooperation, and concentrating short-term training should be adopted, and these methods should be combined. According to the existing situation and experience, centralized training before building cooperatives is indispensable and must be done well.
    The selection of cooperative transformation targets should adopt a method that combines top-down selection with mass self-reporting and public deliberation in order to avoid phenomena such as building cooperatives without meeting the conditions for building cooperatives or failing to transform into cooperatives when the conditions for building cooperatives are met.
    The phenomenon of some places or cadres neglecting the leadership of mutual aid teams must be corrected.
    The process of developing agricultural production cooperation is a process of combining consolidation, development, and preparation for development. At present, many comrades do not recognize the correct relationship between these three, and often there are divisions and isolation, such as rebuilding cooperatives and neglecting consolidation work, or valuing cooperatives and neglecting teams, etc., which will cause difficulties in the advancement of the cooperative cause.
    Fourth, formulate agricultural production cooperative development plans in a realistic manner, and formulate agricultural production and agricultural production technology reform plans accordingly.
    The plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives should be realistic, preventing both greed and blind advancement; and also preventing insufficient estimates of the masses' requirements for building cooperatives and the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, lagging behind the requirements of the masses. The method of preventing these two biases is to combine the method of top-down selection with the method of mass self-reporting and public deliberation. When formulating the plan for building cooperatives, in addition to including the number of cooperatives to be built, attention should also be paid to the further development of the cooperatives and the realization of comprehensive cooperation, and appropriate and reasonable distribution should be made. Attention should be paid to "planting flags everywhere" when the cooperatives are developing greatly, and attention should also be paid to focusing on building cooperatives in high-yield areas, economic crop areas, and areas and towns that have an important impact on promoting cooperation. Within a village, the number of cooperatives to be built and the distribution of cooperatives should also be appropriately determined according to the size of the village, the possibility of expansion after the establishment of cooperatives, and the living conditions of residents. Party members, Youth League members, and village cadres should also be properly assigned in the village so that they can lead mutual aid teams and farmers to build cooperatives in batches. Attention should be paid to the composition of cooperative members when building cooperatives.
    While formulating the plan for building cooperatives, a plan for agricultural production increase and agricultural production technology reform that is compatible with cooperation should be formulated, so that the newly built cooperatives have a clear view of developing production from the beginning, prevent the tendency of building cooperatives in isolation, and can promptly use the superiority of the cooperatives to engage in basic agricultural production construction and technological reform after the establishment of the cooperatives to ensure that agricultural production cooperatives do achieve increased production. This point has not been given enough attention in the past in the Xinxiang area, and this lesson must be remembered. In addition to the formulation by the leading organs, the agricultural production increase and agricultural production technology reform plan should be launched by each cooperative to formulate according to the national plan and the specific conditions of each cooperative at the same time as the establishment of the cooperative. In the winter production plan, special attention should be paid to the basic construction of agricultural production, such as digging wells, repairing canals, developing water conservancy, preventing floods and waterlogging, and improving soil. In the agricultural production technology reform plan, attention should be paid to promoting new-style farm tools (especially double-shared plows) and improving old farm tools. Attention should be paid to training and cultivating technicians for agricultural production cooperatives, strengthening the scientific and technological education of cooperative members, summarizing and promoting advanced farming methods, and overcoming conservative thinking.
    When formulating the plan for building cooperatives, attention should also be paid to selecting and cultivating accounting talents for the cooperatives, so that the necessary and feasible financial management and accounting system can be established in the cooperatives from the beginning of the establishment of the cooperatives, the economic accounting system of agricultural production cooperatives can be implemented, and thrift should be strictly enforced to prevent confusion and corruption and waste. At the same time, the county-level organizations for accounting leadership and guidance for agricultural production cooperatives should be established and improved in order to strengthen leadership in a timely manner.
    In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives should also be developed accordingly with the development of agricultural cooperation.
    In addition to the formulation of construction plans and related plans by Party committees at all levels, various departments related to rural work must also formulate corresponding work plans for serving the construction.
    The task of great development of agricultural production cooperatives after the autumn harvest is huge and arduous, and the existing cooperatives need to be further consolidated; at the same time, it should also be estimated that the tasks of winter production, unified purchase and marketing, and the development of credit cooperatives are also arduous. Therefore, while planning and deploying the work of building cooperatives, it is also necessary to plan and deploy other winter tasks; it is necessary to have a clear center and closely combine various tasks to promote each other, and prevent the phenomenon that the plan for building cooperatives will be shaken when other tasks arrive due to insufficient estimates of other tasks in advance.

    充分做好发展农业生产合作社的准备工作
    中共新乡地委书记　张俊卿
    农业生产合作社大发展的形势正在形成。新乡专区参加互助合作组织的农户，今年夏季已经占总农户的百分之七十五以上；除夏季以前已建立的九百五十三个老社以外，在秋季已经建成和将要建成的农业生产合作社将在一千五百个左右（总计参加农业生产合作社的农户将占总户数的百分之十以上）。要求在今冬建社的农户，据不完全的统计，已有八万多户（占总农户的百分之十二以上）。预计今冬明春参加农业生产互助合作组织的农民将要占到总农户的百分之八十五左右；参加农业生产合作社的农户将要达到总农户的百分之三十左右，有百分之十左右的乡将要基本上实现合作化，有少数区也将基本上实现合作化。
    农业生产合作社的发展又必然要带动并且要求供销合作社、信用合作社的发展；农业合作化的发展，对于农业生产技术改革工作也将提出新的要求；而这也就要求加强对国营地方工业和手工业的领导，发展手工业合作社，以便更多地供应互助合作组织以生产资料。农村各种合作经济的发展，必然要进一步限制农村富农、高利贷者、投机商人的剥削行为；因此，就必然引起城乡资本主义分子对于合作化运动的抵抗和破坏，农村中社会主义因素和资本主义因素的矛盾斗争必然会更加尖锐。农村合作化运动的发展，要求干部的领导水平有更大的、相适应的提高，同时要求在广大农民中继续深入进行党的总路线的教育和农业合作化的方针、政策、办法的教育，进一步提高农民的社会主义觉悟。
    这些情况，说明了随着互助合作组织特别是农业生产合作社发展的新形势的到来，带来了很多新的复杂的任务和问题。这就必须要有党的正确而坚强的领导，并且继续从各方面加强准备工作，以迎接这一形势的到来。如果看不到这种新形势，或者把它简单地看做只是互助组、农业生产合作社的数量的发展，而看不到由这一发展所引起的农村社会、政治、经济等多方面的变化，就会使领导落后于运动和处于手忙脚乱的状态。
    为了迎接秋后农业生产合作社的大发展，新乡地区各地在今年夏季以来已经作了不少准备工作，如贯彻党在农村工作中的领导方针，制订今冬明春农业生产合作化的发展计划，集中力量巩固现有社的组织，加强对互助组的领导，选择和培养建社骨干等等。但是，已经作了的准备工作，和秋后农业生产合作社发展的要求比较起来，还是不充分或很不充分的。因此，必须继续加强秋后发展农业生产合作社的准备工作。根据新乡专区的情况和经验，需要从以下几方面着手：
    第一、继续坚决而认真地贯彻党在农村工作中的领导方针，进一步把党的工作转入以互助合作为中心，切实实现党委书记负责、全党动手的要求；同时要正确地贯彻党在农村工作中的阶级路线。
    应该承认，自从党中央提出把农村党的工作中心转移到互助合作方面来以后，新乡地区党组织执行了这一指示，并且做出了成绩。但是，做得仍然是不够的，有些地方还是很不够的。这主要表现在下列各方面：
    首先，一些同志并未真正懂得农村工作必须以农业生产互助合作为中心的道理，不懂得发展农业生产互助合作就是对农业实行社会主义改造的道路。在实际工作中时常产生所谓“发展生产与发展互助合作相对立”的观点以及中心不明、平均使用力量的现象。有些党委书记虽已动手管互助合作，但却管得不够，也未能认真组织区委、乡支部领导农业生产互助合作。在一些地方，少数人办社多数人看或不管的现象仍然存在着，乡支部未认真领导农业生产合作社的现象还是相当多的，一些组、社无人负责的现象也是存在的。
    其次，在实际工作中，有些同志把发展农业生产互助合作同进行其它各项社会主义改造工作以及向农民进行社会主义教育相对立起来；而不是在进行其他各项社会主义改造工作、向农民进行广泛而深入的社会主义教育时，依靠并通过互助合作组织，又通过实现其他各项社会主义改造任务，促进互助合作组织的巩固和发展。
    再次，一些有关农村工作的部门，还没有很好地把自己的业务工作同农业生产互助合作密切地结合起来，不是使自己的业务工作为农业互助合作的发展巩固服务，并依靠互助合作组织来做好业务工作，而是使部门业务和农业互助合作脱节，“挂不上钩”。
    在贯彻党在农村工作的阶级路线方面，也有偏向和缺点。一部分党员看不见（或虽口喊而实际看不见）在社会主义改造过程中农村阶级斗争的尖锐化、复杂化，既忽视反革命的破坏活动，也不注意富农及城乡资本主义分子对农村合作化的抵抗和破坏活动，更看不见隐蔽和化形的破坏活动，因而处于麻痹和不清醒的状态。在建立贫农与中农之间的经济联盟和政治联盟方面，一方面有一些同志轻视贫农（包括新中农）在社会主义建设中的积极作用，不注意依靠贫农，不注意树立和巩固贫农的优势，而在发展互助组和合作社中发生排斥贫农、使贫农吃亏等现象；另一方面，有一些同志忽视当前中农在农村中的地位及其在发展生产中的作用，不重视团结中农，在互助合作中损害中农的利益。
    以上种种情况如不改变，不但不利于巩固现有的农业生产合作社，也不利于农业生产合作社的大发展。
    目前，继续贯彻党在农村中的领导方针，实现党委书记负责、全党动手的要求，并且正确地执行党在农村工作中的阶级路线，不仅是那一级的党组织的问题，而是包括地委、县委、区委、乡支部以及党所领导的有关农村工作各部门的党组织的全面的领导问题。这是农业生产合作社大发展的新形势所提出来的要求。如果忽视了把区委、乡支部的工作也进一步转上以互助合作为中心，将使大量发展的互助合作组织（特别是农业生产合作社）失掉党的具体而直接的领导，将难于保证党的互助合作的方针政策的实现。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？首先，要继续进行党在过渡时期的总路线的教育，继续组织对于中共中央关于互助合作的两个决议的学习，提高各级干部党员对于党的互助合作理论、路线、政策的认识，总结成功的经验，批判忽视农业生产互助合作的各种错误观点，用实际事例说明农业增产与互助合作的一致性、农业生产互助合作与各项社会主义改造任务的一致性；并且要根据各个时期不同的任务及不同部门的业务加以具体的组织和安排，使它们真正地而不是形式地结合起来。为此，就要在布置各项任务的党代表会议、党的活动分子会议及干部会议中，结合具体工作不断地进行思想教育，并妥善地安排工作。同时，为了较系统地解决这个问题，可以根据可能条件轮流集中区乡干部加以短期训练。其次，各级党的领导同志要以身作则，带领广大干部特别是区乡干部深入社内，了解、学习和研究建社、办社的各种具体问题、政策和经验。同时，应有计划地组织有建社、办社经验的干部，采用带徒弟的办法，帮助没有或缺少建社、办社经验的干部。发挥互助合作网的作用也是用实际经验教育干部的一种有效方法。在仍有不少领导同志缺乏直接建社、办社经验的情况下，领导同志亲自参与建社、办社工作，以取得感性知识，对提高领导水平是有重要作用的。其三，迅速建立和加强地委、县委的农村工作部，使它们成为党委的有力的助手；督促农林、水利、国营经济、供销社等有关农村工作部门，使他们根据党的互助合作特别是农业生产合作社的巩固和发展计划，订出为农业生产服务、推动农业合作化的计划，并定期检查执行计划的情况，以便把各方面的力量统一组织到推进农业合作化方面来。其四，教育乡村的广大党员和团员提高社会主义觉悟，学习合作化的方针、政策、步骤、方法，努力办好社和组，并在社组内起带头作用。其五，为了贯彻党在农村工作中的领导方针和阶级路线，必须继续不断的针对党内的具体思想情况，在各级党员干部中间开展批评与自我批评，肃清资本主义思想。
    第二、切实办好现有的农业生产合作社，认真总结建社、办社的经验，用现有社的具体的优越性吸引更多的农民走合作化道路；用办好现有社的经验，武装干部、党员和积极分子，使它成为全党和广大群众的经验。
    作好秋收分配工作对于巩固现有社、推动生产有决定的作用。因此，必须加强领导，保证收益分配工作正确而顺利地进行。收益分配工作正是从生产的结果中检查社办得好坏及总结经验教训的良好时机。在秋收分配后，应该认真检查总结社的工作及其经验教训，以进一步提高社员的走合作化道路的觉悟，进一步发掘增产的潜在力，找出增产的关键，改善经营管理、劳动组织、评工计分，提高劳动生产率，制订当前生产及冬季生产计划。同时，还可以用总结出来的办社经验和社的优越性教育干部和社外群众。
    在建社中的一项重大问题是在建社时社员的土地、牲口、农具如何处理的问题。因此，认真总结现有的社在这方面的经验和问题，以及不同地区处理这些问题的不同方法，有极重要的意义。新乡地区为准备秋季建社，曾在今年夏季组织了二十一个组，专门检查总结这方面的经验，发现了不少的问题，经过讨论研究，对于秋季建社起了不少作用。
    在进行了秋季建社的地方应该认真总结秋季建社的新经验，这对秋后建社有更直接和更大的作用。
    第三、加强对互助组的领导，根据不同地区的条件提高和发展互助组，认真帮助现有的组（主要是常年组）搞好生产、改进劳动力的组织和评工计分的方法，培养骨干。
    在有条件发展常年组的地方，应该积极帮助临时组转为常年组；在互助合作基础薄弱的地方，应根据生产需要和群众的要求，积极发展临时和常年互助组，为今后建社准备条件。
    在现有互助组的积极分子中，要根据为人正派、善于联系群众，有管理能力和有生产知识的条件，选择和培养建社的骨干，选择和培养会计和技术人员。应该采用向附近的合作社建立联系、组织参观、召开互助合作代表会议、集中短期训练等办法，并且应该把这些办法结合起来。建社前的集中训练，根据现有的情况和经验，是不可缺少并须认真办好的。
    转社对象的选择，应采取自上而下的选择与群众自报公议相结合的方式，以避免发生不够建社条件而建社或够建社条件而未能转社等现象。
    目前有些地方或干部忽视对互助组领导的现象必须纠正。
    发展农业生产合作化的过程，是巩固、发展和准备发展三者相结合的过程。目前不少同志不认识这三者的正确关系，常常发生分割和孤立的现象，如重建社轻巩固工作，或重社轻组等等，这就会造成合作化事业前进中的困难。
    第四、实事求是地制订农业生产合作社发展计划，并且相适应地制订农业生产和农业生产技术改革计划。
    发展农业生产合作社的计划应该实事求是，既要防止贪多贪大，盲目冒进；又要防止对群众建社的要求和互助合作基础估计不足，落后于群众要求。防止这两种偏向的方法，就是要把自上而下选择同群众自报公议的方法相结合。在制订建社计划时，除应包括建社数量外，还应注意从合作社的进一步发展及达到全面合作化着眼，作适当而合理的分布。应该注意在社大发展时“到处插旗”，又要注意把建社的重点放在高产量区、经济作物区和对于推进合作化有重要影响的地区和乡镇。在一个乡村内，也应该根据乡村的大小及建社后扩大的可能和居民居住的情况，适当确定建社数目和社的分布。在乡村内还应该恰当地分配党员、团员和乡村干部，以便使他们分批带领互助组和农民建社。应注意建社时的社员成份。
    在制订建社计划的同时，应制订同合作化相适应的农业增产、农业生产技术改革的计划，使新建社从开始即具有发展生产的明确观点，防止孤立建社的倾向，在建社之后又能及时地利用社的优越性从事农业生产基本建设和技术改革，以保证农业生产合作社做到确实增产。这一点在新乡专区过去是重视不够的，必须记取这个教训。农业增产和农业生产技术改革计划，除领导机关制订之外，应该在建社的同时发动各社根据国家计划和各社的具体情况去制订。在冬季生产计划中，应该特别注意农业生产的基本建设，如打井、修渠、发展水利、防洪防涝、改良土壤等。在农业生产技术改革的计划中，应该注意推广新式农具（特别是双铧犁）和改良旧农具。要注意训练和培养农业生产合作社的技术人员，加强对社员的科学技术教育，总结和推广先进的耕作法，克服保守思想。
    在制订建社计划时，还应注意选择和培养社的会计人材，以便从建社的开始就在社内建立必要而又可行的财务管理和会计制度，实行农业生产合作社的经济核算制，并厉行节约，防止发生混乱现象以及贪污浪费。同时，应建立和健全县级对农业生产合作社会计领导和指导的机构，以便及时加强领导。
    此外，供销合作社、信用合作社以及手工业合作社也应随着农业合作化的发展，相应地发展起来。
    除各级党委制订建社及其有关计划之外，各个有关农村工作的部门也必须作出相应的服务于建社的工作计划。
    秋后农业生产合作社大发展的任务是巨大而繁重的，已有的社还须进一步加以巩固；同时也要估计到冬季生产、统购统销、发展信用合作社等任务也是繁重的。因此，在计划和布置建社工作的同时，也要计划和部署其它各项冬季工作；既要作到中心明确，又要使各种工作紧密结合，互相推动，防止由于事先对其它各项工作估计不足而在其它任务到来时又对建社计划发生动摇的现象。
