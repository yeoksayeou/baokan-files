    Japanese House of Representatives Member Toshio Tanaka Issues Statement
    Welcoming the Joint Declaration on Sino-Soviet Relations with Japan
    Mrs. Pandit Calls on Japan to Develop Traditional Relations with China
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] According to a report in the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on the 22nd: Toshio Tanaka, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Left-wing Socialist Party, and a permanent director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, made a statement to the Hong Kong press on the 21st while passing through Hong Kong on his way back to Japan, supporting the Sino-Soviet joint declaration on relations with Japan. Tanaka said, "I welcome this declaration because it is useful in restoring normal relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union." Tanaka believes that Indian Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China "will help establish peace in Asia." He said, "The meeting of two famous and capable politicians will inevitably discuss many issues related to Asia, and they represent the 960 million people of both countries." He also said, "Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, a fact as obvious as the sun. Liberating Taiwan from Chiang Kai-shek's oppressive rule is China's internal affair, and therefore no other country can interfere."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] Tokyo dispatch: Mrs. Pandit, the former President of the United Nations General Assembly, who is currently visiting Japan, delivered a speech to the Japan Democratic Party on the 21st, calling on Japan to develop its original profound traditional relations with China.
    On the 20th, Mrs. Pandit delivered a speech at a banquet, expressing her firm belief that countries with different backgrounds and traditions can coexist, as long as they learn to be patient and respect each other, and strive for mutual understanding through meetings, discussions, and debates.
    Mrs. Pandit expressed doubt about the effectiveness of military alliances in which major powers supply weapons to smaller countries. She said that such alliances do not prevent war, but rather exacerbate the situation.

    日本众议院议员田中稔男发表谈话
    欢迎中苏两国对日关系联合宣言
    潘迪特夫人要求日本发展同中国的传统关系
    【新华社二十三日讯】据香港“大公报”二十二日报道：日本众议院议员、左派社会党中央执行委员会委员、日中友好协会常任理事田中稔男，二十一日途经香港回国时对香港报界发表谈话，拥护中苏关于对日本关系的联合宣言。田中稔男说：“我欢迎这个宣言，因为它在恢复日本和中苏两国间正常关系方面是有用的。”田中稔男认为印度总理尼赫鲁访问中国“将有助于亚洲和平的确立”。他说：“两国著名而能干的政治家的会晤，必将谈到有关亚洲的许多问题，而他们代表着两国九亿六千万的人民”。他还说：“台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是像太阳一样明显的事实。把台湾从蒋介石的压榨统治下解放出来，是中国的内政问题，因此任何别的国家都不能干涉。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：目前正在日本访问的前联合国大会主席潘迪特夫人，二十一日向日本改进党发表演说，要求日本发展同中国原有的深厚的传统关系。
    二十日，潘迪特夫人在一次宴会上发表演说，表示她坚决相信：世界上不同背景和传统的国家是可以共处的，只要它们学习忍耐和互相尊重，并通过会议、讨论和辩论努力求得彼此间的了解。
    潘迪特夫人对那种大国把武器供给较小国家的军事联盟的功效表示怀疑。她说，这种联盟并不能制止战争，反而会使局势恶化。
