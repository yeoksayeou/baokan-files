The harvest of over 34 million mu of soybeans throughout the province has greatly exceeded last year's level. According to statistics from Heze, Jining, and Liaocheng prefectures alone, the soybean harvest is 630 million jin more than last year. Millet and corn in the Yimeng Mountains and along the Yi and Shu Rivers have also seen universal bumper harvests. The 12 million mu of autumn crops in Linyi Prefecture alone produced 475 million jin more grain than last year. The 700,000 mu of spring corn in Wendeng Prefecture generally increased production by 10% to 20% compared to last year. It is estimated that the province's 9.3 million mu of cotton will yield 220 million jin more ginned cotton than last year, just from the increase in yield per unit area. In counties such as Binxian, Xiajin, and Gaomi, the average yield of ginned cotton can reach 140 to 150 jin per mu. Currently, on the boundless cotton fields on the alluvial plains of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, teams of women are busily picking new cotton. The 10 million mu of peanuts densely distributed in the hilly areas of the Shandong Peninsula and the Yimeng Mountains have stems and leaves that reach the knees, and the roots are full of pods.
