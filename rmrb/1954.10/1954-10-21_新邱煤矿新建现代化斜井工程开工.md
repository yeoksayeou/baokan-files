    New Modern Inclined Shaft Project Begins at Xinqiu Coal Mine
    The new modern inclined shaft project at the Xinqiu Coal Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau commenced on October 5th.

    This project is designed under the guidance of Soviet experts and is based entirely on the Soviet standard inclined shaft design. The main shaft will use double-track transportation, and the coal faces will utilize the "longwall" mining method to ensure safe production. At the same time, coal cutting machines, coal loading, and coal transportation machinery will be used for production. The inclined shaft will also have offices, rest and study rooms, recreation rooms, bathhouses, health rooms, and sun lamp rooms. This new inclined shaft will begin production in twenty months and its output will be equal to one-third of the output of all existing inclined shafts in the Xinqiu Coal Mine and can continue to be mined for twenty years. The workers participating in this construction project are very excited. The earthwork team of Wang Weichang overfulfilled the groundbreaking daily plan for four days on October 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th. Old worker and construction site supervisor Xue Jufu said: "During the puppet Manchurian era, the Gaodesan pit in Fuxin took three years to open an inclined shaft. That was for the Japanese invaders. Now we are opening a new inclined shaft for ourselves, for socialist industrialization. The leadership said it will be completed in twenty months, we will work harder to complete it ahead of schedule." (Zheng Jinyou)

    新邱煤矿新建现代化斜井工程开工
    阜新矿务局新邱煤矿新建现代化斜井工程已于十月五日开工。
    这个工程设计是在苏联专家指导下、全部按着苏联标准斜井设计进行的，主井筒是双轨运输，在采煤场子上完全用“长壁式”采煤方法，可保证安全生产。同时，还使用截煤机、装煤和运煤等机械生产。在斜井上还设有办公室、休息和学习室、娱乐室、洗澡室、保健室和太阳灯室。这个新建斜井将在二十个月以后开始生产，产量将等于现有新邱煤矿所有斜井产量的三分之一，并可继续开采二十年之久。参加这个建设工程的工人们都非常兴奋，王维昌土方小组在十月五、六、七、八日四天都超额完成破土日计划。老工人兼工地施工员薛巨福说：“伪满时代阜新高德三坑开斜井开了三年，那时是给日本侵略者干的。现在是给咱自己开新斜井，是为了社会主义工业化；领导上说二十个月建成，我们加把油要提前把它完成。”　（郑金有）
