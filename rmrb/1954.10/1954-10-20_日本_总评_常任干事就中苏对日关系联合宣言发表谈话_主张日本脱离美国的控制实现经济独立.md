Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: Soichi Taguchi, Standing Secretary of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), issued a statement on the 15th regarding the Sino-Soviet joint declaration on relations with Japan. He said: "The Sino-Soviet joint declaration, which has now been published, has aroused a great response among the people who have suffered greatly as a result of the US-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement. The movement to demand the lifting of trade restrictions between China, the Soviet Union and our country has become a people's movement. If trade restrictions are lifted and a normal economy, that is, a peaceful economy, is established, it can not only provide jobs for unemployed and semi-unemployed workers, but also save small and medium-sized enterprises and all classes that are on the verge of collapse. We must actively work to resolve the various problems hindering the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. Only in this way can Japan break away from US control and achieve economic independence."

    日本“总评”常任干事就中苏对日关系联合宣言发表谈话
    主张日本脱离美国的控制实现经济独立
     【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：日本工会总评议会常任干事田口宗一十五日就中苏两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言发表谈话。他说：“这次发表的中苏联合宣言，已在由于美日共同防御援助协定而备尝痛苦的人民之间，引起很大的反响。要求取消中苏和我国之间的贸易限制的运动，已成为人民的运动。如果取消贸易限制并建立正常的经济即和平经济，既可以使失业的和半失业的工人得到工作，也可以拯救正在倒闭中的中小企业和一切阶层。我们必须积极努力解决阻碍日中两国恢复邦交的种种问题。这样，才能使日本脱离美国的控制，实现经济独立。”
