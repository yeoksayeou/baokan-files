The East German film "The Invincibles" depicts a glorious and victorious page in the history of the German working class struggle – the heroic struggle of the German working class in the difficult years of oppression under the "Anti-Socialist Laws" of the late 1870s and 1880s. Through its authentic and vivid depiction of the revolutionary struggle of the working class during this period, it elucidates an irrefutable truth: that the power of the working class, inspired by Marxist revolutionary thought, is irresistible and invincible.

After the formation of the German Empire in the early 1870s, capitalism developed rapidly in Germany. With the concentration of industrial production, the working class and the workers' movement also grew rapidly. Alarmed by the development of the workers' movement, Bismarck, the "Iron Chancellor" of Germany at the time, a royalist from the Prussian aristocratic landlord class and the mortal enemy of the working class, decided to adopt a policy of violent suppression. In 1878, the German government promulgated the "Anti-Socialist Laws." All conditions for the legal activities of the working-class party were abolished. With the persecution of the enemy, coupled with the wavering of internal opportunists, a period of arduous struggle began. However, neither prisons and exile, nor the lamentations and clamor of opportunists, could frighten or stop the working class from advancing. Under the leadership of party leaders August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, they combined illegal and legal work, adhering to an uncompromising struggle. The continuous growth of the working-class force finally forced the German government to abolish the "Anti-Socialist Laws" in 1890.

"The Invincibles" reflects the history of the German working class struggle during this stage. The film reflects the complex and arduous struggle of this period in a generalized and vivid way through the depiction of the representative figures of the working class, as well as the depiction of the leading figures of the party, through their lives and struggles: supporting striking miners, donating money to help the families of arrested workers, secretly printing and distributing revolutionary slogans and leaflets, secret party meetings, ideological struggle within the party, contempt and ridicule for police and scabs, struggle in parliament... etc., reflecting the irreconcilable contradiction between the proletarians and the bourgeoisie, as well as the contradiction between the two lines and two ideologies within the leadership group of the Social Democratic Party and within the working class.

The image of Schultz, the representative figure of the advanced workers of that time created by the film, is a successful typical image. In him, we see the heroic image of the working class who is loyal to his beliefs, and we see the excellent qualities of the working class. He always stands at the forefront of the struggle, and wherever there is a boiling struggle, he appears. He brings the support and sympathy of the Berlin workers to the striking miners in the Ruhr area; he reminds the striking workers to correctly understand the reactionary nature of Kaiser Wilhelm II and dissuades the workers' representatives from begging the Kaiser for sympathy; he goes to the party leader Bebel for advice; he works hard in the secret printing press; at the party meeting, he sharply refutes the compromising arguments of the moderate Fromm... He is always fighting for the interests of the working class, for "reasonable wages, an eight-hour work day, Sunday rest, and getting together with the family." However, these revolutionary activities almost completely occupy the time he spends with his family. He is a selfless fighter, infinitely loyal to the cause of the working class, but at the same time, in the family, he is also a good husband and a good father. For example, the light-hearted joke when answering his wife's complaints; taking his wife to a dance and introducing her to Bebel; and bringing a nightingale to his young son... The interweaving of such details helps us to glimpse the rich and pure spiritual world of this strong fighter of the working class.

The scene of Schultz being interrogated by the warden after being arrested is touching. This scene prominently demonstrates the awe-inspiring heroic spirit of the working-class fighter. Schultz answered the warden's interrogation by saying: "...Who are the instigators behind me, who are they? I can't say them all, because there are too many, it is the German workers and the entire people standing behind me, and they will soon defeat your 'Anti-Socialist Laws', you should believe that!" What a firm and powerful answer! It was such unyielding workers who, under the persecution of reactionary forces, still persisted in the struggle, leading and influencing the surrounding masses, leading and influencing the younger generation (such as Franz and Gertrude), advancing further and further along the path of truth, and finally won the victory against the "Anti-Socialist Laws." Schultz is one of the millions of such workers at that time. Their lives and struggles themselves show that the power of the working class is invincible.

The film also achieves remarkable success in shaping the image of Bebel, the beloved leader of the German workers. The victory of the German working class's struggle against the "Anti-Socialist Laws" in the late 1870s and 1880s was inseparable from the leadership of the Social Democratic Party, the working class's political party at the time, and its leader Bebel. In this struggle, "Bebel proved himself to be the true leader of the party. He was able to see the danger in time, to recognize how correct Marx and Engels' criticism was, and to turn the party to the path of uncompromising struggle." (Lenin) There is a scene in the film where Bebel, in the place where he lives under an assumed name, reads a letter from Engels, who is far away in London, to Liebknecht. In the letter, Engels criticizes Liebknecht for "trying to straighten out Fromm's mind," "like a ridiculous old hen, busy hatching duck eggs." In this episode, we can intimately feel the importance and trust these two workers' leaders place in Engels' opinions. What follows is a scene of a secret party meeting. At this meeting, Bebel sternly rebuked the moderate Fromm's proposal to compromise with the enemy. In the film, we see a lively, lovable, and respectable leader who has close ties with the working masses. In contrast to the passionate and firm image of this great worker fighter who came from a lathe worker background, the image of the moderate Fromm, who is afraid of offending the reactionary ruling class and always advocates that "we should reach an understanding with the enemy," appears even more vile and contemptible.

The struggle is complex and arduous. Within the party and the working class, it is necessary to resolutely expose the treacherous propositions of the opportunists and win over the working masses affected by opportunism; and the enemy they face is also exceptionally fierce and cunning. The film also uses concise and powerful artistic generalization techniques in depicting the enemy. For example, it only uses a few scenes, such as the charge of the Kaiser's cavalry against the striking worker masses, Kaiser Wilhelm II's instructions to the workers' representatives..., to vividly expose the face of the reactionary ruling class. As for the police officers' buying off scabs, the spies' stalking, and the eviction of the families of arrested workers, etc., they show some other aspects of the reactionary ruling class's efforts to undermine the workers' movement in every possible way. All these descriptions can help us to understand the complexity and arduousness of the class struggle at that time more deeply.

The film also has some shortcomings that are felt. The most important one is, as a commentary in the "Neues Deutschland" on this film once pointed out: the film does not fully and clearly show that the rejection of the "Anti-Socialist Laws" in the parliament was a victory of the illegal struggle, and behind this victory lies the huge power of the proletariat. Therefore, in the film, the abolition of the "Anti-Socialist Laws" gives the audience a relatively sudden feeling, and may even make those viewers who are not very familiar with this period of history think that the "Anti-Socialist Laws" were abolished only because of the parliamentary struggle, or because Wilhelm II adopted a more intelligent policy than Bismarck.

However, small shortcomings cannot obscure the artistic achievements of this film. The film's achievements in portraying the leading figures and heroic figures of the working class, and its artistic generalization techniques for huge historical events, have many aspects that are worth learning by our filmmakers.

The film artists of the German Democratic Republic, with their outstanding artistic talents, realistically and convincingly reproduced this glorious struggle history of the German working class in the late 19th century. History not only lets us know the past, it also lets us see the future. The power of the working class is invincible! It is in this sense that this film has a great inspiring and educational role. It will inspire our working class, who are the masters of the country, to fight for the consolidation of victory and for the greater victory of the cause of the working class; it will also inspire the proletarians in many countries who are still under reactionary rule to throw themselves into heroic battles to throw off the "chains around their necks."

    看民主德国影片“不可战胜的人们”

    民主德国的影片“不可战胜的人们”描写了德国工人阶级斗争史的光辉的胜利的一页——十九世纪七十年代末和八十年代，德国工人阶级在反社会主义者的“特别法”的压迫的艰苦年月中的英勇斗争。它通过对于这一时期的工人阶级革命斗争的真实的生动的描绘，阐明了一个颠扑不破的真理：为马克思主义革命思想所鼓舞的工人阶级的力量，是不可抵御的，不可战胜的。
    十九世纪七十年代初，德意志帝国形成之后，资本主义在德国得到了飞速的发展。随着工业生产的集中，工人阶级和工人运动也迅速成长壮大起来。震惊于工人运动的发展，当时德国的“铁血宰相”、出身于普鲁士贵族地主阶级的保皇党人、工人阶级的死敌俾斯麦决定采取暴力镇压的政策。一八七八年德国政府颁布了反社会主义者的“特别法”。工人阶级政党的一切合法活动的条件都被取消了。敌人的迫害，加上内部机会主义分子的动摇，艰苦斗争的时期开始了。但是，不管是监狱和流放，不管是机会主义分子的悲叹和叫嚣，都不能吓住或阻止工人阶级前进。他们在党的领袖奥古斯特·倍倍尔和威廉·李卜克内西的领导下，把不合法的和合法的工作结合起来，坚持着不妥协的斗争。工人阶级力量的不断增长，终于迫使德国政府在一八九○年废除了“特别法”。
    “不可战胜的人们”所反映的就是这一阶段的德国工人阶级的斗争历史。影片通过对工人阶级代表人物的描写，以及对党的领袖人物的描写，通过他们的生活和斗争：支援罢工中的矿工，捐款救济被捕工人的家属，秘密印刷和散发革命标语、传单，党的秘密集会，党内的思想斗争，对于宪警和工贼的鄙视和嘲弄，国会上的斗争……等等，概括地、生动地反映了这一时期的复杂、艰巨的斗争，反映了无产者与资产者之间的不可调和的矛盾，以及社会民主党领导集团内部和工人阶级内部两条路线、两种思想的矛盾。
    影片所创造的当时先进工人的代表人物舒茨的形象，是一个成功的典型的形象。在他身上，我们看到了忠于自己信念的工人阶级的英雄形象，看到了工人阶级的优秀品质。他总是站在斗争的最前面，哪里沸腾着斗争，他就在哪里出现。他把柏林工人的支持和同情带给罢工中的鲁尔区的矿工；他提醒罢工的工人们正确地去认识德皇威廉二世的反动本质，劝阻工人代表们去向德皇乞求同情；他到党的领袖倍倍尔那里去求教；他在秘密印刷所中辛勤地工作；在党的会议上，他对温和分子福罗姆的妥协论调尖锐地给以反击……他时时刻刻在为工人阶级的利益，为“合理工资，八小时工作制，星期日的休息，和家人聚聚”而斗争。可是这些革命活动却几乎完全侵占了他和家人团聚的时间。这是一个为公忘私、无限忠实于工人阶级事业的战士，但，同时在家庭里，他也不失为一个好丈夫、好父亲。例如，回答妻子的抱怨时的轻松的玩笑；带领妻子去参加舞会，介绍她与倍倍尔相识；以及带给小儿子一只黄莺……这样一些细节的穿插，都帮助我们窥见了这个工人阶级的坚强战士的丰富而纯洁的精神世界。
    舒茨被捕后在狱吏面前受审的那个场面是动人的。这个场面突出地表现了工人阶级战士的正气凛然的英雄气概。舒茨回答狱吏的审问说：“……谁是我背后的指使人，他们是谁？我不能够全说出来，因为实在太多了，是站在我后面的德国工人跟全体人民，而且他们就要很快地战胜你们的‘特别法’，你应当相信这点！”这是何等坚定、有力的回答！正是这样一些坚贞不屈的工人，在反动势力的迫害下，仍然坚持着斗争，带动着、影响着周围的群众，带动着、影响着年青的一代（例如弗朗兹和盖楚德），沿着真理的道路前进，再前进，终于争得了反“特别法”的胜利。舒茨就是当时千千万万这样的工人里的一个。他们的生活和斗争本身，就说明了工人阶级的力量是不可战胜的。
    影片在塑造德国工人敬爱的领袖倍倍尔的形象上，也有卓越的成就。上世纪七十年代末和八十年代德国工人阶级反对“特别法”的斗争的胜利，是同当时工人阶级的政党社会民主党及其领袖倍倍尔的领导分不开的。在这一斗争中，“倍倍尔证明了他自己是党的真正的领袖。他能够及时地看出危险，认识到马克思和恩格斯的批评是如何的正确，并能够把党转向到不妥协的斗争的道路上去。”（列宁）影片里有这样一个场面，倍倍尔在他化名居住的地方向李卜克内西读远在伦敦的恩格斯的来信，信中批评李卜克内西“想整顿福罗姆的脑筋”，“好似一只滑稽的老母鸡，在忙着孵鸭子的蛋”。在这段插曲里，我们可以亲切地感到这两位工人领袖对于恩格斯的意见的重视和信任。接下去，就是党的秘密集会的场景。在这个会上，倍倍尔义正辞严地斥责了温和分子福罗姆的和敌人妥协的主张。在影片里，我们看到的是一位生气勃勃、同工人群众有着密切联系的、可亲可敬的领袖形象。和这位镟工出身的伟大的工人战士的热情的坚定的形象相对照，那个生怕触怒反动统治阶级、总是主张“应当和敌人取得谅解”的温和分子福罗姆的形象就更显得猥琐和可鄙。
    斗争是复杂的、艰巨的。在党内和工人阶级内部，既要坚决揭露机会主义分子的叛卖主张，把受机会主义影响的工人群众争取过来；而面对着的敌人，又是异常凶狠、异常狡黠的。影片在描写敌人方面，也运用了简洁、有力的艺术概括手法。例如，它只用几个场面，如德皇的马队向罢工工人群众的冲杀，德皇威廉二世对工人代表的训谕……，就鲜明地揭露了反动统治阶级的面目。至于警官的收买工贼，特务的盯梢，勒令被捕工人家属搬家，等等，则又表现了反动统治阶级千方百计地破坏工人运动的另一些侧面。所有这些描写，都能帮助我们更深刻地了解当时阶级斗争的复杂性和艰巨性。
    影片也有一些令人感到不足的地方。最主要的，就是“新德意志报”关于这部影片的一篇评论所曾指出的：影片没有充分地、脉络鲜明地表现出“特别法”在国会被否决，乃是非法斗争的胜利，这一胜利的背后隐藏着无产者的巨大的力量。因此，在影片里，“特别法”的废除，给观众一种比较突然的感觉，甚至会使那些不太熟悉这段历史的观众以为“特别法”之被废除，仅仅是由于国会斗争，或是由于威廉二世采取了比俾斯麦更为聪明的政策。
    但，小的缺点绝不能掩蔽这部影片的艺术成就。影片在刻划工人阶级的领袖人物和英雄人物方面的成就，对于巨大的历史事件的艺术概括手法，有很多地方都是值得我们的电影工作者学习的。
    民主德国的电影艺术工作者，用他们的卓越的艺术才能，真实地、令人信服地再现了十九世纪末叶德国工人阶级的这一段光辉的斗争史实。历史，不仅仅让我们知道过去，它也让我们看到未来。工人阶级的力量是不可战胜的！正是在这个意义上，这部影片有着很大的鼓舞和教育作用。它将鼓舞我们做了国家主人的工人阶级，为巩固胜利、为争取工人阶级事业的更大胜利而斗争；它也将鼓舞那些仍处在反动统治下的许多国家的无产者，为丢掉自己“颈上的锁链”而投入英勇的战斗。（附图片）
