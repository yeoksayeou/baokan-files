The Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and other units are actively preparing for winter construction. The Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and other units are actively preparing for winter construction. The winter construction tasks of the Third Engineering Bureau this year are very heavy, accounting for more than 27 percent of the total annual tasks. The bureau has summarized the experience of winter construction last year and is taking concrete measures to actively prepare for winter construction. In the preparation of plans and the determination of tasks, key construction projects suitable for winter construction were carefully selected. In early September, instructions on this year's winter construction were issued, stipulating that for subgrade earthwork projects, drainage equipment should be prepared in areas with accumulated water first, and labor should be organized appropriately to cooperate with mechanical construction; for bridge engineering, the "warm bottle method" or "warm room method" should be used for cold protection; for housing construction, in order to use the "freezing method" to build brick surfaces in large quantities in winter, it is stipulated that the foundation should be built before freezing. Experienced engineers are also organized to write popular winter construction learning materials and distribute them to the staff of relevant sections and teams for learning.

The Jialing River Bridge Engineering Team of the Second Engineering Bureau is also actively preparing for winter construction. The main pier projects of the first and second Jialing River Bridges on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway must be completed during the winter dry season, and the caisson projects must be sunk to the bottom layer in winter; at the same time, the Qinghe Bridge project must also start construction in winter. In early August, the Jialing River Bridge Engineering Team held a meeting of cadres above the level of squad leader and took concrete measures to actively prepare for winter construction. Special personnel have been sent to sign contracts with relevant supply departments for machinery, equipment, and living supplies. Cement, generators, pile drivers, dredgers, diving equipment, etc. are being transported to the construction site from Northeast China, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places.

The employees of the Jialing River Bridge Engineering Team have full confidence in overcoming the difficulties of winter construction. Engineer Yao Shangda suggested using cement bags instead of burlap bags for cofferdams, which has been successfully tested, solving the difficulty of insufficient burlap bags. It is estimated that more than 350 million yuan can be saved in the fourth quarter. In order to ensure the quality of winter construction, the employees have generally launched the study of winter construction rules, and now they generally understand the ratio of cement to water and the maintenance methods of concrete, etc. The construction site employees are launching a labor competition with technological innovation as the content, striving to break through the new quotas and create conditions for comprehensive winter construction.

    铁道部第三工程局等单位
    积极进行冬季施工的准备工作
    铁道部第三工程局等单位积极准备冬季施工。第三工程局今年冬季的施工任务很重，约占全年任务的百分之二十七强。该局总结了去年冬季施工经验，正采取具体措施，积极进行冬季施工准备工作。在编制计划、确定任务方面，慎重地选择了适于冬季施工的重点工程项目，九月上旬发布对今年冬季施工的指示，规定路基土方工程先做好有积水地方的排水设备，适当组织劳动力，配合机械施工；桥梁工程方面，规定采用“暖瓶法”或“暖房法”防寒；房屋建筑工程为了在冬季用“冻结法”大量砌筑砖面，规定在结冻前把基础砌好。并组织有经验的工程师编写通俗的冬季施工学习资料，分发给有关段、队的职工学习。
    第二工程局嘉陵江桥梁工程队，也正积极进行冬季施工准备工作。宝成路上嘉陵江第一、第二号大桥主要桥墩工程要在冬季枯水期完成，沉箱工程要在冬季沉到底层；同时，青河桥工程也要在冬季开工。嘉陵江桥梁工程队在八月上旬召开了中队长以上的干部会议，采取了具体措施，积极做好冬季施工的准备工作，对于机具器材、生活用品，派出专人和有关供应部门签订了合同。水泥、发电机、打桩机、挖泥机、潜水设备等正由东北、上海、天津等地往工地运送。
    嘉陵江桥梁工程队的职工们，有充分信心克服冬季施工的困难。工程师姚上达建议用水泥袋代替麻袋布围堰，经过试验已经成功，解决了麻袋不足的困难，估计在第四季度内可节省三亿五千多万元。为了保证冬季施工质量，职工们普遍展开了冬季施工规则的学习，现在一般都懂得了水泥、水分的比例和混凝土的保养方法等。工地职工正以技术革新为内容展开劳动竞赛，争取突破新定额，为冬季全面施工创造条件。
