Experiences of the Beishaling Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Implementing Reasonable Distribution After Suffering Disaster and Production Reduction

    Problems Brought About by Disaster and Production Reduction
      The Beishaling Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, suffered a severe flood this year shortly after its establishment. The cooperative played a significant role in the fight against the disaster; however, compared to normal years, production was significantly reduced. The cooperative originally planned for an agricultural income of 33 million yuan worth of grain, plus 3.8 million yuan from sideline occupations, totaling 38 million yuan. However, according to reliable estimates, agriculture can only yield 20.2 million yuan worth of grain, and the total income including sideline occupations will be only about 24 million yuan.
    The decrease in income has brought great problems to the autumn harvest distribution and current production. According to the original plan, after deducting land rent, livestock rent, repayment of fertilizer costs, this year's production consumption (such as fodder, seeds, agricultural tool depreciation, etc.), public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, etc., only 17.5% to 19.5% would be left for labor dividends. Originally, each labor day was estimated to yield more than 8,000 yuan, but now it yields less than 2,500 yuan. Seeing this situation, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members greatly declined. Early-maturing crops like naked oats were already ripe, and yams were soaking in the mud, but the cooperative members were lazy and unwilling to work. Those with fewer means of production thought, "Anyway, I won't get much by working or not working, so why should I work?" Those with more means of production thought, "I have land rent, livestock rent, and fertilizer costs, which is almost enough, and I won't get much more by working hard." Out of the 23 households in the cooperative, only seven or eight people went to the fields every day. Twenty-three mu of naked oats took seven days to harvest, and there was still some left. Cooperative member Liu Hailong had little land and no livestock. Fearing that after deducting land rent, livestock rent, and fertilizer costs, he would not get much and would not be able to make a living, he went to find work outside the pass. A few days after he left, seven other people in the cooperative also slipped out of the pass one after another. Two others were also planning to leave. The agricultural producers' cooperative became demoralized and lacked enthusiasm for production.
    In late August, the Yanggao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent a work team to the Beishaling Cooperative. The work team first studied the current problems within the Party and the cooperative's management committee. Everyone unanimously believed that to consolidate the agricultural cooperative and improve production, it was necessary to ensure that both cooperative members with more and fewer means of production could receive reasonable compensation, and it was necessary to solve the problem of low labor compensation. How could this be achieved? Everyone suggested several methods: (1) Find ways to increase production and income, and reduce expenditures. This is a fundamental method. (2) This year, public accumulation funds and public welfare funds will not be retained. (3) The production investment for next year (seeds, fodder) was originally planned to be deducted uniformly after the autumn harvest, but now it will be deducted appropriately based on each household's situation. However, even with the above methods, the labor dividend could not be significantly increased. After thinking about it, everyone believed that the main method was to appropriately adjust the remuneration for means of production (land rent, livestock rent, etc.). Finally, it was decided to convene a cooperative member meeting to discuss the matter.

      A Fierce Debate
    The cooperative member meeting began. Everyone had no objection to increasing production and practicing thrift, not retaining public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, and changing the method of deducting next year's investment. However, when it came to adjusting the remuneration for means of production, there were objections. Zhang Zhijin, Liu Tirong, Lu Zhicheng, and some other cooperative members with more means of production opposed doing so. Hu Shengfu, Wang Shengfu, Liu Xiong, and some other cooperative members with fewer means of production supported doing so. Zhang Zhijin said, "The land rent and livestock rent were fixed in the spring, why should they be changed?" (This cooperative implemented a fixed rent system.) Hu Shengfu said, "Isn't the public grain fixed too? Why is it that when disaster strikes, it is still legally reduced or exempted?" Lu Zhicheng said, "Disaster is disaster, you can't blame the land, livestock, or manure." Liu Xiong retorted:
  "Does that mean disaster should be blamed on labor? Why was it planned to distribute 8,000 yuan for a day's work, but now it's less than 2,500 yuan?" Livestock raiser Lu Zhicheng said, "Livestock rent should not be reduced. If my cattle had plowed the land for others in the spring, and now disaster strikes and production is reduced, can I ask him to find cattle to compensate me?" Liu Xiong, who had no livestock, stood up and refuted, "What you're saying is only one side of the truth. Does that mean only labor should have its wages reduced? Who doesn't know that during the busy farming season, we can earn 8,000 yuan for a day's short-term work outside the cooperative, and meals are included! If you want the original rent, I want my original wages! Otherwise, I'll supplement your rent, and you supplement my wages."
    Just as the two sides were arguing inconclusively, Wang Lin, who had not spoken much, said, "I think nothing should be reduced. Land rent and livestock rent should be distributed less this year, and then repaid next year. Wouldn't that be good for both sides?" Before he could finish speaking, everyone objected, "If it's not reduced, it's unreasonable. Repaying it next year is still unreasonable. The adjustment should be made this year, so that the trouble of one year doesn't fall on two years."
    "Oh! Do whatever you want!" Although Lu Zhicheng was reasoned into submission, he was still unhappy in his heart. He muttered, "Adjusting it back and forth is just taking my flesh to fill other people's holes. Anyway, it's beneficial to those who do more labor, and not beneficial to us."
    Seeing that the cooperative members with more means of production had not truly understood the idea, the work team inspired everyone to discuss this question: Is implementing a reasonable adjustment "taking flesh to fill holes"? Is it only beneficial to those who do more labor, or is it beneficial to everyone?
    Deputy Director Lu Zhiming was the first to speak, saying, "I have a lot of land and I'm also a livestock raiser. Let me say something fair: disaster and production reduction affect everyone, and labor should definitely not be treated unfairly. If land rent and livestock rent are still claimed at the original amount, then an unfair advantage will be taken, and labor will suffer a great loss. Implementing reasonable adjustment is to ensure that you don't take an unfair advantage, and that you don't suffer a loss, so it can't be called 'taking flesh to fill holes.' If a disaster occurs and production is reduced when you're working outside the cooperative, then who is to blame for 'taking' your own 'flesh'?"
    Branch Secretary Lu Qingrong continued, "If we look at the labor situation in the past few days, we can understand this question. The 23 mu of naked oats in our cooperative could have been harvested in one day, but it took seven days to harvest, and there was still some left over; if there's a hailstorm, and nothing is harvested, I'd like to see who can get a share? If we make a reasonable adjustment, everyone's enthusiasm for labor will be higher, and the harvest will be improved. This is not only beneficial to those who do more labor, but also beneficial to those who have more land and raise livestock."
    Cooperative member Wang Shengfu said, "Actually, where can the reduction go? The melons are in the garden, and the garden grows the melons. No matter how much you reduce, it won't leave the cooperative. If land rent and livestock rent are reduced, labor income will be increased. If one end is reduced, the other end is increased. If we work a few more days in the autumn, we can make up for it, and it won't be much different."
    After such a discussion, the cooperative members with more means of production understood the idea. Zhang Zhijin said, "The adjustment is a reasonable reduction, not a complete wipeout. Without adjustment, my income would be higher than others, and with adjustment, my income will still be higher than others. Others do the same amount of labor as me, but their income will still be worse than mine." Liu Tirong said, "We can't just look at the present, we have to look at the future." Only Lu Zhicheng was still dissatisfied with the adjustment. Originally, he didn't want to work and just wanted to live off rent. Everyone criticized this "no work, no food" mentality, and in the end he also agreed.

    Methods of Reasonable Adjustment
    Everyone had no objections to the adjustment, and then they discussed how to adjust the issue and unanimously proposed the following two standards of adjustment: First, it is necessary to implement the principle of distribution based primarily on labor and also taking into account the means of production, so that the distribution ratio tends to be reasonable; second, it is necessary to ensure that cooperative members whose land has suffered different degrees of disaster can obtain reasonable income.
    They first discussed adjusting the rent amount for the land. The disaster situation of the cooperative's land was different. The disaster on the slopes was lighter, the disaster on the beaches was heavier, the disaster for naked oats and millet was lighter, and the disaster for sorghum, glutinous millet, and yam was heavier. Since the disaster situation of each plot of land was inconsistent, how should the land rent be reduced? Liu Tirong proposed the method of "reducing rent by plot," that is, less reduction for light disasters and more reduction for heavy disasters. Originally, Liu Tirong's land had suffered very light disasters, so this method of rent reduction would be beneficial to him. However, households that suffered heavy disasters did not agree with this method. Lu Zhiming said, "This method of rent reduction is not fair. We are now cooperating. Although the land is still our own, it is under the unified management of the cooperative. What to plant on that plot of land, how much fertilizer to apply, and whether to hoe early or late are all decided by the cooperative. The good or bad harvest cannot be the responsibility of the land-owning household. For example, the cooperative planted sorghum on Lu Ming's river bend land, and now it can only harvest at most 10%. Zhang Zhijin's river bend land was planted with naked oats, and it can harvest 60%. The land of these two families is the same, but because of the different crops planted, one family suffers a light disaster and the other suffers a heavy disaster. If it weren't for the unified management of the cooperative, perhaps Lu Ming wouldn't have planted sorghum, and he wouldn't have suffered such a heavy disaster. Zhang Zhijin might not have planted naked oats, and he wouldn't have gotten so much harvest. If we reduce the rent by plot, Lu Ming reduces 90%, and Zhang Zhijin reduces 40%, is this reasonable?" "Unreasonable, unreasonable! In the past, when we were working independently, the light was light and the heavy was heavy. Now that we are cooperating, there should be a spirit of mutual assistance!" Some households that suffered heavy disasters all muttered.
      "I propose that we classify all the land in the cooperative. All land of the same grade, regardless of the severity of the disaster, should have the same rent reduction and the same rent payment." Lu Zhiming's suggestion was agreed upon by everyone. Then, the cooperative's land was divided into five grades, with the maximum rent reduction of 100% and the minimum rent reduction of 30%. Who knew that such a classification and reduction would cause a problem again? Liu Tirong, whose land was good and the disaster was light, was the first to disagree. He said, "With this, my land rent is not even enough to pay the public grain. The land rent is reduced uniformly, but the public grain has to be paid by the household. Everyone knows that the crops on my land are good, and my public grain cannot be reduced, but the land rent has been classified at 70%. Isn't that 70% of rent and 100% of grain payment? Looking at Lu Ming, although he only gets 30% rent, his land has no harvest, so he doesn't have to pay grain. The land rent is a net gain. Isn't that the land that suffers from heavy disasters is benefiting, and the land that is good and suffers light disasters is suffering?"
    Reducing it by plot is not feasible, and classifying it is also not feasible, so the work team proposed a "unified rent reduction" method to everyone, that is, regardless of whether the disaster is light or heavy, the land is good or bad, the rent is reduced by 40% uniformly (because this year suffered 40% disaster). This method of reduction is in line with the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, but there is still a contradiction between unified land rent reduction and public grain payment by households. Some are "60% rent, no public grain payment"; others are "60% rent, 100% public grain payment." This is still unreasonable.
      How to solve this contradiction? Lu Qingrong, Lu Zhiming, Zhang Zhijin and others all proposed that since the land rent is reduced uniformly by the entire cooperative, the public grain should also be uniformly exempted by the entire cooperative. The method is to add up all the public grain exempted by each household in the cooperative, and then compare it with the total amount borne by the entire cooperative to see how much the entire cooperative is exempted on average, and then each household will pay public grain according to this average reduction percentage. In this way, land rent and public grain are unified, and the problem of "high rent, low grain payment; low rent, high grain payment" is solved. Everyone felt that this method was good. Those with light disasters were not afraid that "land rent is not enough to pay public grain," and those with heavy disasters were not afraid that "disaster strikes and no share."
    They also studied the adjustment of livestock rent. Before anyone could speak, Lu Zhiming hurriedly said, "Livestock cannot be reduced in the same way as land. Land rent is a net gain except for public grain. Although livestock gets livestock rent, it also has to pay for the rice for raising livestock. Besides, large livestock become less valuable year by year, and agricultural tools also have depreciation fees. Can livestock be raised for free? Livestock raising households must be able to make a profit!" Originally, Lu Zhiming himself raised a livestock. However, everyone listened to him and found it reasonable, and then decided that land rent should be reduced by 40% and livestock rent should be reduced by 30%. Is this reduction okay? Everyone calculated a small account. Liu Tirong's cattle rent is the least, and he can still get six and a half dou of coarse grain after deducting the livestock rice. Lu Tianyuan's cattle have the most rent, and he can still get two shi of coarse grain after deducting the rice to be paid.
    Although everyone agreed to the above adjustment methods, many people were still unclear whether they met the standards of reasonable distribution. To this end, they calculated two accounts after the adjustment: First, they calculated a general account, that is, an account comparing the benefits of labor distribution with the benefits of means of production distribution. The calculation results proved that after the adjustment, the current distribution ratio basically conforms to the principle of distribution based primarily on labor and also taking into account the means of production. According to the original planned income calculation, the remuneration for means of production (including land and livestock, etc.) accounted for 40.5% of the net income, and the labor dividend, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund accounted for 59.5% of the net income. If there is no adjustment after the disaster, the remuneration for means of production will account for 71.2% of the net income; and the labor dividend, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund will only account for 28.8%. After the adjustment, the remuneration for means of production accounts for a little more than 43.4% of the net income; and the labor dividend (no public accumulation fund or public welfare fund is retained) accounts for a little more than 56.5% of the net income. The second account is the household account of the income situation of each household, which is of the most concern to the cooperative members. The calculation results are: (1) The difference in income reduction among households is not large. The actual agricultural income of the entire cooperative is 60% of the original plan; plus the sideline income, it is 65% of the original plan. After deducting production consumption, the net income is 56% of the original plan. If the disaster occurs and there is no adjustment, some households can earn more than 80%, and some households will have less than 40%. After the adjustment, the income of each household is between 50% and 60%, and the difference is not large. (2) The income of each household is generally stronger than that of farmers outside the cooperative. From the overall situation of the entire cooperative, it is stronger than farmers outside the cooperative. If there is no adjustment, some households will be two or three times stronger than farmers with the same economic conditions outside the cooperative, while some will be worse than farmers outside the cooperative. After the adjustment, the income of each household is generally 20% to more than 100% higher than that of farmers with the same economic conditions outside the cooperative. This means that every household can get a reasonable income. (Of course, no matter how it is adjusted, it is still difficult to fully take care of households that only have means of production and no labor, or too little labor, or no means of production or labor. But because there are no such farmers in this cooperative, basically every household is taken care of.)

    After the Adjustment
    After the account is calculated, the heart is clear. Cooperative members with little means of production and more labor are most satisfied. Young man Hu Yongfu said, "The Communist Party cares too much. If you don't have land, they give you land. If you are afraid that you can't increase production, they let you cooperate. If cooperation suffers a disaster and the distribution is unfair, they send people to adjust it. If I didn't join the cooperative this year, I would get at most three shi of grain, but now I can get more than six shi." Households with more means of production are also satisfied because their income is stronger than that of farmers outside the cooperative. Middle peasant Lu Tianyuan couldn't help but recall the past. He said, "My land is all river bend land, and it used to be completely destroyed by water. Now it's good, if the river bend is washed away, there is beach land, if the beach land is flooded, there is slope land. In 1933, my land was washed away and I didn't harvest a single grain. At that time, I had cattle and donkeys, but who gave me rent? Before the autumn harvest, my dad and I ran out of the pass and wandered for two years without going home; my dad fell ill in Taolin. At that time, who cared? This year, although my sixteen mu of river bend land was not washed away by the water, it can only harvest 10% due to flooding; but in addition to land rent, livestock rent, and fertilizer costs, I can also get a dividend for labor. This is incomparable to the past!" The two cooperative members who were preparing to go outside the pass also did not leave after the adjustment. Lu Yongji, who had already slipped out of the pass, his wife has also been asking someone to send a message to ask him to come back these days. The agricultural producers' cooperative has changed from being scattered to being united and consolidated.
    The labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members has also been greatly improved. Before the adjustment, the cooperative assigned Guo Wanzhi to cultivate the land, and Guo Wanzhi said, "Hey, a day's labor is not enough to grind my footboard money!" He refused to go. After the adjustment, the labor remuneration increased, and Guo Wanzhi repeatedly asked the cooperative cadres, "Hurry up and hitch up the plow, I have planted those lands, I know how deep and shallow to plow, let me contract it." Before the adjustment, three laborers could only thresh half a bag of naked oats in a day, and even then no one wanted to go. After the adjustment, people rushed to go, and three people threshed two and a half bags of naked oats in a day. Liu Tirong, Zhang Zhijin, and others, who had been very resistant to adjusting the distribution, were also happy to see these things. They said: The adjustment was right; if it weren't for the adjustment, it might not be possible to harvest the crops in the field.
    Currently, the cooperative is actively preparing to harvest the major autumn crops, and is looking for income from various sources to make up for the losses caused by the disaster. Many farmers outside the cooperative, seeing that the agricultural producers' cooperative has good production and good distribution, are also actively requesting to join the cooperative.

    北沙岭农业生产合作社遭灾减产后实行合理分配的经验
    姚文锦
    遭灾减产带来的问题
      山西省阳高县北沙岭农业生产合作社今年才成立起来就遭到了严重的涝灾。社在和灾害斗争中发挥了很大优越性；但比起常年的情况来，终究是大大减产了。社里原计划农业收入粮食折款三千三百多万元，加上副业收入为三千八百多万元。但根据可靠的估计，农业只能收入粮食折款二千零二十万元，加上副业收入也不过二千四百万元左右。
    收入的减少，给秋收分配和当前的生产带来了很大的问题。按原定计划估算分配，除去地租畜租、归还肥料款和当年的生产消耗（如草料、种籽、农具折旧等）、公积金、公益金等以外，劳动分红只剩下百分之十七点五到百分之十九点五。原计划每个劳动日可分八千多元，现在分不到二千五百元。社员们看到这种情况，生产情绪大大低落。早熟作物的莜麦已经黄了，山药在泥里泡着，但社员们懒洋洋地不去干活。生产资料少的想：“反正劳动不劳动也分不上，我劳动它干甚。”生产资料多的想：“我有地租、畜租、肥料款，也差不离了，多劳动也多分不上。”全社二十三户，每天下地的只有七、八人。二十三亩莜麦割了七天，还留着个尾巴。社员刘海龙地少、没牲口，怕收入除去地租、畜租、肥料款后，分不到什么了，没法生活，便到口外揽工去了。他走了没几天，社里就有七个人也先后溜出口外去了。还有两个人也打算要走。农业生产合作社就这样人心涣散、生产没劲了。
    八月下旬、中共阳高县委派一个工作组到了北沙岭社。工作组首先在党内和社务委员会上研究了当前的问题。大家一致认为：要巩固农业社、搞好生产，必须使生产资料多和生产资料少的社员都能得到合理报酬，必须解决劳动报酬过低的问题。怎么能做到这一点呢？大家提出了几个办法：（一）设法增加生产、增加收入，紧缩开支。这是个根本办法。（二）今年暂不留公积金、公益金。（三）明年的生产投资（籽种、草料）原定为秋收后统一扣除，现在改为根据各户情况适当扣除。但用上述办法仍不能使劳动分红显著提高。大家想来想去，认为主要办法还是适当地调整生产资料（地租、畜租等）的报酬。最后，便决定召开社员大会来讨论。
      一场激烈的争论
    社员大会开始了。大家对增产节约，不留公积金、公益金，改变明年投资的扣除办法，都没啥意见。但一提到要调整生产资料的报酬、可就有意见啦。张志金、刘体荣、吕志成等一些生产资料多的社员反对这样做。胡生富、王生福、刘雄等一些生产资料少的社员赞成这样做。张志金说：“地租、畜租春天就定死啦，为啥要翻活？”（这社实行的是死租制）胡生富说：“公粮莫非没定死？为啥遭了灾还依法减免哩？”吕志成说：“遭灾是遭灾，不能怨土地、牲口、粪。”刘雄反过来问他：
  “难道遭灾怨劳动吗？为啥原计划劳动一天分八千，现在分不到两千五？”养畜户吕志成说：“畜租不该减。我的牛要是春天给别人耕了地，这阵遭灾减了产，能叫我给他找牛偿吗？”没畜的刘雄就站起来驳斥：“你们说的是一面理。难道就是劳动该减工钱吗？谁不知道农忙时我们在社外打一天短工就挣八千，还得管饭哩！你们要原封租子，我还要我的原封工钱哩！要不然，我给你们补租子，你们给我补工钱。”
    两头正争论不下，不多说话的王林发言了，他说：“我看啥也别减了，地租、畜租今年少分些，等下年再补还，这不是两头都好吗？”没等他说完，大家就反对开啦：“不减不合理，明年补还还是个不合理。要调整就在当年，不能一年遭灾落二年的麻烦。”
    “唉！爱咋着就咋着吧！”吕志成虽然让大家拿理说住了，可是心眼上总不乐意，他又嘀嘀咕咕地说道：“调来调去还不是挖上我的肉补别人的窟窿。反正对劳动多的人有利，对咱没利。”
    工作组看到生产资料多的户思想没有真正搞通，便启发大家讨论这问题：实行合理调整是不是“剜肉补窟窿”？这样做光对劳动多的人有利，还是对大家都有利？
    副社长吕志明首先发言说：“我是个地多户，又是个养畜户，叫我说句公道话：遭灾减产是大家，决不能光亏屈劳动。地租、畜租要是还按原来的数目要，就占了非分的便宜，劳动就吃了大亏。实行合理调整是既不叫你占非分的便宜，又不叫你吃亏，所以不能叫‘剜肉补窟窿’。要在社外的时候遭灾减了产，那又怨谁‘剜’了自己的‘肉’呢？”
    支部书记吕庆荣接着说：“咱们看看前几天的劳动情况就明白这问题啦，咱社那二十三亩莜麦，本来一天就可以割完，但是割了七天还留着个尾巴；要碰上场雹子，一颗不收，我看谁能分上？要是合理调整一下，大家的劳动劲头高了，提高了收成，这不光对劳动多的人有利，对地多养牲口的也同样有好处。”
    社员王生福说：“其实，减还能减在那里，瓜在园，园栽瓜，减来减去出不了社里。地租、畜租减了，劳动收入就加啦。这头减了那头加，秋季再多赶几个工，补不过来也不差什么。”
    经过这样的讨论，生产资料多的社员思想搞通了。张志金说：“调整是合理减，又不是一扫光。不调整我比别人收入多，调整了还能比别人收入多。别人跟我一样的劳动，收入还是要比我差。”刘体荣说：“咱不能光看眼前，不看往后呀。”唯有吕志成一人还是不满意调整。原来他不想劳动光想靠租子吃饭。大家对这种“不劳而食”的思想批判了一顿，最后他也同意了。
    合理调整的办法
    大家对调整都没意见了，接着就研究怎样调整的问题，一致提出以下两项调整的标准：第一、要贯彻以劳为主、兼顾生产资料的分配原则，使分配比重趋于合理；第二、要使土地受到各种不同程度的灾害的社员都能得到合理收入。
    他们先讨论调整了土地的租额。全社土地的受灾情况是不同的。坡地灾轻，滩地灾重，莜麦、谷子灾轻，高粱、黍子和山药灾重。各块地受灾情况既不一致，那么，地租该如何减呢？刘体荣提出“按块减租”的办法，即灾轻的少减，灾重的多减。原来刘体荣的地遭灾都很轻，这样减租对他有利。可是灾重户就不同意这办法。吕志明说：“这样减租可不公。咱们现在合作了，土地虽说还是自己的，但归社统一经营了，那块地种啥，施多少肥，先锄后锄都是由社决定的，收成好坏决不能让地户负责。比方吕明的河湾地，社里种了高粱，现在顶多收一成。张志金的河湾地种了莜麦，就可收六成。这两家的地本是一样的，就因为种的作物不同，一家灾轻一家重。要不是社里统一经营，也许吕明就不种高粱，那就遭不了这么重的灾。张志金也许不种莜麦，也就得不到那么多的收成。如果按块来减，吕明减九成，张志金减四成，这合理吗？”“不合理，不合理！过去单干是轻的轻，重的重，如今合作了，该有个互助精神啊！”一些灾重户都嘟囔开了。
      “我提议，咱们把全社的土地都划分一下类型。凡是同等的地，不管遭灾轻重都同等减租、同等付租”。吕志明的这个建议得到了大家的同意。接着就把全社的地划为五等，最多的减租十成，最少的减租三成。谁知道，这么一划一减，可又有了问题啦。地好、灾轻的刘体荣第一个不同意，他说：“这么一闹，我的地租连公粮也不够缴啦。地租是统一减了，可是公粮得按户缴。大家知道我的地庄稼好，我的公粮减不了，可是地租却划到七成去了，这不是七成得租、十成缴粮吗？再看看人家吕明，虽然只得三成租，可是地里没收成了，不用缴粮了，地租是净落。这不是地赖灾重的沾光，地好灾轻的吃亏吗？”
    按块不行、划类型也不行，工作组就给大家提出了个“统一减租”的办法，就是不管灾轻灾重地好地坏，一律按四成减租（因为今年遭了四成灾）。这样减法合乎互助互利的精神，但是统一减地租和按户缴公粮还有矛盾。有的是“六成得租，不缴公粮”；有的却是“六成得租，十成缴粮”。这仍然不合理。
      怎样解决这个矛盾呢？吕庆荣、吕志明、张志金等都提出：既然地租是全社统一减，公粮也该全社统一免才对。办法是，把全社各户免去的公粮全加到一起，再跟全社负担总数作一比较，看全社平均免了几成，然后各户都按这个平均减免的成数缴公粮。这样，地租、公粮统一了，就把“得租多，缴粮少；得租少，缴粮多”的问题解决了。大家感到这办法就是好，灾轻的不怕“地租不够缴公粮”了，灾重的也不怕“遭灾分不上”了。
    他们又研究了畜租的调整问题。别人还没张口，吕志明就忙说：“这牲口可不能跟土地一样减啦。地租除了公粮是净落。牲口虽然得畜租，但还得交养牲口的米。再说，养大牲口一年比一年不值钱，农具还有折旧费，牲口能白养活吗？养畜户总要算得过账来才行呀！”原来吕志明本人就养着一头牲畜。不过大家听他说的在理，这才确定：地租减四成，畜租减上三成。这样减行不行呢？大家算了个小账。刘体荣的牛租子最少，除去牲口米还可落六斗半粗粮。吕天元的牛，租子最多，除去应交的米还可落两石粗粮。
    上述调整办法大家虽然同意了，但是否达到了合理分配的标准，很多人还说不清。为此，便在调整后算了两笔账：首先算了一笔总账，即劳动分益生产资料分益对比的账。算的结果证明：经调整后，目前的分配比重已基本上符合于以劳为主并兼顾生产资料的分配原则了。按原计划收入计算，生产资料（包括土地牲畜等）的报酬占纯收入的百分之四十点五，劳动分红和公积金、公益金占纯收入的百分之五十九点五。遭灾后若不调整，则生产资料的报酬即占到纯收入的百分之七十一点二；劳动分红和公积金、公益金只占百分之二十八点八。经调整后生产资料的报酬占纯收入的百分之四十三点四强；劳动分红（公积金、公益金不留了）占到纯收入的百分之五十六点五强。第二笔账是社员所最关心的各户收入情况的分户账。算的结果是：（一）各户收入减少情况相差不大了。全社农业实收入是原计划的六成；加上副业收入是原计划的六成半。除去生产消耗以后，纯收入是原计划的五成六。分配到各户，如果遭灾后不调整，有的户可收入八成以上，有的户还不到四成。经调整后，各户收入都在五成到六成之间，相差不大了。（二）各户收入情形普遍比社外农民强了。从全社总的情况看，比社外农民强得更多。若不调整，有的户比社外同等经济条件的农民要强两三倍，而有的还不如社外农民。经调整后，各户普遍比社外同等经济条件的农民多收入百分之二十到一倍以上。这就是说，户户都能得到合理的收入了。（当然，无论怎样调整，对于只有生产资料全无劳力或劳力过少或生产资料劳力俱无的户，仍是很难完全照顾得周到的。但因为这个社没有这样的农户，所以基本上每户都照顾到了。）
    调整以后
    算了账、心底亮。生产资料少而劳动多的社员最感满意。小伙子胡永富说：“共产党关心的太周到啦。没地给分上地，有了地怕增不了产又让实行合作；合作遭灾分配不公了，又派人来调整。今年我要不入社，顶多收三石粮，现在能分六石多。”生产资料多的户也因收入比社外农民强而感到满意。中农吕天元不由得想起过去。他说：“我的地都是河湾地，往年让水一冲就全完了。现在可好啦，冲了河湾有滩地，涝了滩地还有坡地。一九三三年，我的地被冲后颗粒不收，那时也有牛有驴，可是谁给租子？没等秋收，我和我爹就跑出口外，流浪了二年没回家；我爹病倒陶林。那时候，谁管呢？今年我那十六亩河湾地虽没被水冲，涝的也只能收一成了；可是我除地租、畜租、肥料款都能分上以外，劳动还能分红。这和过去可不能比啊！”正打点着要到口外去的两个社员，调整后也不走了。已溜出口外的吕永吉，他妻子这几天也正寻人捎话叫他回来。农业生产合作社由涣散变得团结巩固了。
    社员的劳动情绪也大大提高了。调整前社里分派郭万枝去耕地，郭万枝说：“嘿，劳动一天还不够磨脚板钱！”说啥也不去。调整后劳动报酬提高了，郭万枝再三向社干部要求：“快套犁吧，那些地我种过，耕深耕浅我知道，算我包下吧。”调整前三个劳力一天才摔半口袋莜麦，就这还叫谁谁不去。调整后人们抢着去，三个人一天就摔两口袋半莜麦。从前对调整分配抵触很大的刘体荣、张志金等看到这些事也高兴啦，他们说：调整闹对啦；不是调整地里的庄稼还不一定收回收不回呢。
    目前社里正积极准备收割大秋作物，并从多方面找收入、以弥补遭灾的损失。许多社外农民看到农业生产合作社生产好、分配好，也在积极要求入社。
