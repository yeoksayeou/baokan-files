Actively Complete Autumn Planting Tasks According to National Plan

Since August, the nationwide agricultural overproduction campaign, widely launched by farmers in non-disaster areas to compensate for losses in disaster areas, has achieved great results. According to extremely incomplete statistics, the planting area increased by nearly 100 million mu due to replanting, expanding replanting areas, and increasing late-season planting. At the same time, strengthening field management and meticulous harvesting have also greatly increased yields. This has not only partially compensated for the losses caused by disasters in disaster areas, but also educated the vast number of farmers with facts, making them realize the huge potential of agricultural production and enhancing their confidence in increasing production. In order to consolidate and develop the achievements of overproduction and strive for greater victories, it is now necessary to promptly guide the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production to autumn and winter sowing and preparations for spring plowing next year.

The main tasks of this year's autumn planting are to complete the sowing plans for wheat and rapeseed. According to the national economic construction plan, the national wheat sowing area this autumn will remain stable at last year's level, but some adjustments need to be made in different regions: in the cotton-growing areas of the northern winter wheat producing regions, cotton fields should be appropriately expanded and some wheat fields reduced; winter fallow fields in the south should be appropriately expanded for wheat planting, provided that the planting plans for other crops are guaranteed. Completing this task requires a lot of mobilization and organizational work. The state also requires that the oilseed planting area be expanded by more than 30 million mu in the two years of 1955 and 1956, of which rapeseed accounts for the vast majority, totaling more than 19 million mu. This plan must also be completed during the autumn planting. In addition, various regions should plant other crops and green manure such as purple clover according to local conditions, in order to prepare for increasing rice production next year.

Currently, wheat sowing is underway in various places, and rapeseed sowing has also begun. Various places have made arrangements based on the national plan and government instructions, and the preparations are generally well done. The provincial agricultural leadership departments are very energetic, and the plans determined by each province are greater than the tasks stipulated by the state. However, determining the plan, making arrangements, and issuing calls are only the beginning of the work. To accurately complete the sowing plan and even complete the production increase plan, there is still much arduous work to be done. We still lack experience in carrying out agricultural production in a planned way; especially when the number of farmers organized into agricultural production cooperatives only accounts for a small part of the total number of farmers, it is very difficult to require agricultural production to be carried out according to plan; the adjustment of planting areas and the expansion of oilseed areas will change the farming habits and even the living habits of many farmers; in addition, the disaster area this year is quite large, and the expansion of planting late autumn crops in overproduction has squeezed out some wheat fields, so there are still many difficulties.

Therefore, to complete the sowing plan for wheat and rapeseed, major efforts must be made in the following aspects.

First, it is necessary to adhere to mutual aid and cooperation as the center, make appropriate arrangements for various rural tasks, and rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to drive the masses to complete the autumn sowing tasks. At present, the progress of wheat sowing is slow. For example, in the Anyang area of northern Henan, wheat should have been sown around the Cold Dew (October 9), according to the solar term, but by the 13th, the places with more sowing had only completed two-thirds. The leadership of wheat sowing in other regions is also not tight enough. One of the main reasons is the lack of reasonable arrangements for various tasks, and the leadership of production is relaxed when there are many tasks. This autumn and winter, the rural work is very heavy. On the one hand, the unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton cloth, and oilseeds, and the unified purchase of cotton, the great development of agricultural production cooperatives, and the repair of dike breaches caused by floods must be done well. On the other hand, the area of late fields this year is relatively large, and the maturity period of crops is relatively late. In some areas, autumn harvesting and autumn planting are squeezed together, and the organization of labor will be very difficult. In this case, to complete so many tasks well, it is necessary to make reasonable arrangements, unified leadership, and carry out around the center of mutual aid and cooperation. It is necessary to rely on agricultural production cooperatives to drive mutual aid groups and mobilize the vast number of farmers to act in unison. At present, some areas have found the phenomenon of "emphasizing purchase and neglecting production" and "separation of cooperative construction and production." Some farmers have the idea of ​​waiting to join the cooperative and relaxing autumn plowing and autumn planting and accumulating fertilizer, which must be overcome. Only by doing a good job in organizational leadership and ideological mobilization can the realization of the plan be guaranteed.

Second, it is necessary to continue to strengthen publicity and education, so that rural cadres and the vast number of farmers understand the necessity and benefits of planting according to the national plan, and further enlighten the farmers' socialist consciousness in combination with practical work. It is necessary to fully recognize the self-sufficiency ideas of the farmers and estimate that the farmers may still have some ideological concerns about the state's unified purchase and sale policy. For example, in concentrated oilseed producing areas, they believe that the oilseeds produced are enough for local use and are unwilling to increase production; areas accustomed to eating animal fats are not active in increasing oilseed production; areas that were not accustomed to planting oilseeds in the past are often unwilling to change their habits and demand that oils and fats be supplied from other places. Therefore, rural cadres and the masses of farmers should further recognize that the planting plan and regional adjustment requirements for grain, cotton, and oilseeds are determined by the state after careful planning and arrangements based on the entire economic construction and the needs of the people (including the needs of farmers). Producing according to the national plan can guarantee the smooth progress of national construction. This is the duty of every farmer and has many benefits for the farmers themselves. This not only conforms to the long-term fundamental interests of the farmers, but also conforms to the current interests of the farmers. Because, planting according to local conditions is easy to increase crop yields; various places in the south use winter fallow fields to plant more rapeseed, which can not only increase income, but also use rapeseed leaves as fertilizer, and can also increase cake fertilizer, which is also good for increasing rice production next year. By explaining these principles to the farmers and closely combining the fundamental interests of the state with the vital interests of the farmers, the farmers may be able to produce according to the national plan.

Third, it is necessary to strengthen specific guidance on autumn planting, especially to do a good job in technical guidance. Leadership must not just sit in the office and issue calls and instructions. More importantly, it must go deep into the masses and deep into reality to understand the specific situation and difficulties of work progress and mass thinking. On the one hand, it must constantly check and supervise, and on the other hand, it must help grassroots cadres and the masses solve problems and overcome difficulties. Sichuan Province has done a relatively good job in this regard. It has sent many cadres to the countryside, summarized the main technical experience of rapeseed production increase, and trained technicians among the farmers to promote advanced experience. This practice should be universally adopted in various places. In some areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, farmers have the habit of plowing rapeseed as green manure; if technical guidance is not strengthened and attention is not paid to cultivation and management, even if the sowing area is completed, if the rapeseed does not grow well, it may still be plowed before seed setting. In areas that have not been accustomed to planting rapeseed in the past, technical guidance should be particularly strengthened to ensure a good harvest, so that farmers can specifically feel that planting rapeseed in winter fallow fields is indeed beneficial to the country and themselves, and lay the foundation for further increasing oilseed production in the future. The total sowing area of ​​wheat does not increase, but the total output is required to increase. This requires more to increase the yield per unit area (the yield per unit area this year has increased by 13.3% compared with last year, and it is required to increase by 3% to 4% more than this year next year). Therefore, technical guidance must be further strengthened for wheat cultivation. The proven and effective advanced experience, such as deep plowing, close planting, and selection of good seeds, should be further promoted according to local conditions. Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, this year requires that the close planting area of ​​wheat reach 75% of the county's wheat field area. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels actively organize carpenters to transform old drills according to the requirements of close planting, and various districts also hold technical training on shaking drills to ensure the realization of this technical requirement. This practice should also be imitated in various places. In addition, how to ensure full seedlings in sowing and avoid the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges is also of great importance to ensuring increased production. Therefore, the soil moisture, seeds, etc. must be checked to prevent empty talk about advanced technology and neglect of attention to ordinary specific problems.

Fourth, it is necessary to solve the problem of processing existing oilseeds and the supply of oil cakes for farmers, and implement correct price policies. After the farmers sell the oilseeds to the state according to the regulations, the oilseeds retained by themselves can be organized by the supply and marketing cooperative to be squeezed by local methods; the supply of edible oil and oil cakes for farmers should also be improved. The oilseed prices in individual areas (such as Hunan and Jiangxi) are unreasonable, and the state has also made adjustments. Various places should work well in accordance with these regulations. Other things such as pesticides and wheat seed loans should also be supplied in a timely manner. In areas where crop planting has been adjusted this year, seeds and fertilizers are lacking in advance. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should prepare for allocation and supply or organize regulation as soon as possible to ensure the completion of the sowing plan.

Fifth, special leadership must be strengthened for the drainage and rush planting in disaster areas, and strong support must be given. At present, there are still about 80 million mu of flooded farmland across the country undergoing drainage and rush planting, of which about 30 million mu of farmland in severely affected areas are unlikely to be drained in the short term. At present, the victims in some areas where floodwaters have been drained are returning to their hometowns to produce one after another; solving the autumn planting difficulties in disaster areas, first of all, the supply of seeds is an arduous task. The relevant economic departments should allocate wheat, barley, rapeseed, broad beans, and vegetable seeds, which are urgently needed for sowing in disaster areas, as soon as possible; for some areas where floodwaters cannot be drained immediately, they should also reserve a portion of grain crops and vegetable seeds suitable for late sowing, so that they can be sown in time after drainage; it is also possible to promote the method of first raising seedlings and then transplanting them after the water recedes. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate the people in the disaster areas to carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance in times of adversity, organize themselves, help each other, and solve the difficulties in production.

### 按照国家计划积极完成秋种任务

    按照国家计划积极完成秋种任务
    八月份以来，全国广大非灾区农民为弥补灾区损失而普遍开展的农业超额增产运动，已有很大成就。据极不完全统计，由于改种补种、扩大复种面积、增植晚田等所增加的种植面积就将近一亿亩。同时，因加强田间管理、精收细打，也使收获量有很大提高。这样就不但部分弥补了灾区因灾减产的损失，并且以事实教育了广大农民，使他们认识到农业生产的巨大潜在力量，提高了增加生产的信心。为了巩固和发扬超额增产的成就，争取更大的胜利，现在必须及时地把群众的增产热情引到秋播冬播和明年春耕的准备工作中去。
    今年秋种的主要任务是完成小麦和油菜的播种计划。根据国家整个经济建设的计划，全国今年秋季小麦的播种面积，虽仍稳定在去年的水平上，但在地区上需要作若干调整：北方冬小麦产区的宜棉地区，要适当扩大棉田，缩小一些麦田；南方的冬闲田要在保证完成其他作物种植计划的条件下适当扩大麦田。完成这项任务是需要进行很多的动员和组织工作的。国家还要求在一九五五年一九五六年两年内，扩大油料种植面积三千多万亩，其中油菜占绝大部分，计一千九百多万亩。这个计划也必须在秋种中完成。此外，各地还要因地制宜种植其它作物和紫云英等绿肥，为明年水稻增产作好准备。
    现在，各地小麦播种正在进行，油菜播种也已开始。各地都根据国家计划和政府指示作了布置，准备工作一般的作得都还好，省级农业领导部门的劲头很足，各省确定的计划都大于国家规定的任务。但是，确定了计划，进行了布置，发出了号召，只不过是工作的开始。要准确地完成播种计划以至完成增产计划，还有许多艰苦的工作要做。对于有计划地进行农业生产，我们还很缺少经验；特别是在组织到农业生产合作社里的农户还只占总农户的一小部分的情况下，要求农业生产按计划进行，是很困难的；种植区域的调整，油料面积的扩大，都要改变许多农民的耕作习惯以至生活习惯；加上今年灾区面积相当大，在超额增产中扩大种植晚秋作物时又挤掉了一些麦田，困难还是很多的。
    因此要完成小麦和油菜的播种计划，还必须从以下几个方面作重大的努力。
    第一、必须坚持以互助合作为中心，把各项农村工作加以适当的安排，并且依靠互助合作组织带动广大群众完成秋播任务。目前小麦播种的进度是迟缓的。如河南北部安阳地区，按照节令在寒露（十月九日）前后就应该种完小麦，可是至十三日种的较多的地方才完成了三分之二。其他地区对小麦播种的领导抓得也不够紧。主要原因之一是对各种工作缺乏合理的安排，在任务很多的情况下放松了对生产的领导。今年秋冬两季农村的工作是很繁重的。一方面粮食、棉布、油料的统购统销和棉花的统购，农业生产合作社的大发展，洪水冲决的堤防缺口的修复等，都必须做好。另一方面，今年的晚田面积较大，作物成熟期较晚，有些地区秋收秋种挤在一起，劳动力的组织将很费力。在这种情况下，要很好地完成这么多任务，必须合理安排，统一领导，围绕着互助合作这一中心来进行。必须依靠农业生产合作社，带动互助组，发动广大农民一致行动。现在有些地区发现有“重收购、轻生产”和“建社生产脱节”的现象，部分农民中有等待入社而放松秋耕秋种和积肥的思想，必须注意加以克服。只有作好了组织领导和思想动员工作，才能保证计划的实现。
    第二、必须继续加强宣传教育工作，使农村干部和广大农民了解按照国家计划种植的必要和好处，结合实际工作进一步启发农民的社会主义觉悟。必须充分认识农民中的自给自足思想，并估计到农民对国家统购统销政策还可能有一些思想顾虑。例如油料集中产区，认为生产的油料已经够本地用了，就不愿再多增产；习惯吃动物脂肪的地区，对于增产油料也不积极；过去不习惯种油料的地区，往往不肯改变习惯，要求由外地供应油脂。因此，应当使农村干部和农民群众更进一步认识粮、棉、油料的种植计划和区域调整要求，是国家根据整个经济建设和人民的需要（包括农民的需要），经过周密的计划和安排而确定的。按照国家计划生产，才能保证国家建设的顺利前进，这是每个农民应尽的义务，并且对农民自己也有很多好处。这不但符合农民的长远的根本的利益，也符合农民目前的利益。因为，因地制宜地进行种植，作物产量便于提高；南方各地利用冬闲田多种油菜，不但可以增加收入，而且油菜叶子可以作为肥料，又可以增多饼肥，对明年水稻的增产也有好处。把这些道理向农民讲清楚，把国家的根本利益和农民的切身利益密切结合起来，农民是可能按照国家计划进行生产的。
    第三、要加强对秋种的具体领导，特别是作好技术指导。领导决不能只是坐在机关里发号召、发指示，更重要的是深入群众、深入实际，了解工作进展和群众思想的具体情况和困难，一方面不断检查督促，一方面帮助基层干部和群众解决问题、克服困难。四川省在这方面是做得比较好的，派了许多干部下乡，总结了油菜增产的主要技术经验，并且训练了农民群众中的技术员，推广了先进经验。这种作法应该在各地普遍采用。湖南、江西和湖北的一部分地区，农民有把油菜翻耕了作为绿肥的习惯；如果不加强技术指导，不注意培育管理，即使完成了播种面积，油菜长得不好，就仍可能有很多在未结籽前就翻耕了。在过去没有种油菜的习惯的地区，更要特别加强技术指导，保证得到丰收，使农民具体地感觉到利用冬闲田种油菜确实对国家对自己都有好处，为今后进一步增产油料打下基础。小麦播种总面积不增加，总产量则要求提高。这就要更多地提高单位面积产量（今年的单位面积产量比去年已提高了百分之十三点三，明年要求比今年再提高百分之三到四）。因此，对小麦的耕作也必须进一步加强技术指导。已经肯定的行之有效的先进经验，如深耕、密植、选用良种等，应当因地制宜地进一步加以推广。山西解虞县今年要求小麦密植面积达到全县麦田面积的百分之七十五，各级供销社积极组织木工依照密植要求改造旧耧，各区并举办了摇耧的技术训练，以保证这一技术要求的实现。这种作法也是各地都应当仿效的。此外，播种中如何保证全苗，避免缺苗断垄现象，也和保证增产有重大关系，因此对墒土、种籽等必须加以检查，防止空谈先进技术而忽视对平常具体问题的注意。
    第四、要解决农民现有油料的加工问题和油饼供应问题，并贯彻正确的价格政策。农民按照规定把油料出售给国家以后自留的油料，可以由供销合作社组织土榨；对于农民用食油和油饼的供应工作，也要加以改进。个别地区（如湖南、江西等地）油料价格不合理，国家也已进行调整。各地应很好地按照这些规定进行工作。其他如农药、麦种贷款等，也应力求及时供应。今年作物种植调整的地区，种籽肥料等事先缺乏准备，各地供销社更应及早准备调拨供应或组织调剂，以保证播种计划的完成。
    第五、对于灾区的排水抢种问题必须特别加强领导，大力扶持。现在全国还有约八千多万亩被淹农田正在进行排水抢种，其中约有三千多万亩重灾区农田的积水短期难望排出。现在部分排除积水地区的灾民，正陆续返乡生产；解决灾区的秋种困难，首先是种籽的供应，是个艰巨的任务。各有关经济部门要尽快调拨灾区播种中所迫切需要的小麦、大麦、油菜、蚕豆、以及蔬菜等种籽；对有些马上还不能排除积水的地区，还要储备一部分适宜晚播的粮食作物及蔬菜的种籽，以便排水后及时播种；也可以推广先行育苗到水退后再行移栽的办法。同时还要教育灾区人民发扬患难互助的精神，组织起来，互相帮助，解决生产中的困难。
