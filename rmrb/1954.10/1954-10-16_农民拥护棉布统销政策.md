    Peasants Support the Unified Purchase and Sale Policy for Cotton Cloth
    Jian Chu
    Huanghuashi is a small town in the second district of Changsha County. Since 1953, and especially in the first half of this year, the sales department of the district supply and marketing cooperative in the town has been crowded with farmers from all directions every morning. The once quiet town has become lively.

    "Farmers are not only eating better, but also paying attention to their clothing," a cooperative cadre told me. Afraid that I wouldn't believe him, he enthusiastically opened the ledger for me to see. In 1952, the cooperative supplied only 1,424 bolts of various fabrics. This increased to 3,911 bolts in 1953, and in the first half of 1954 alone, 3,033 bolts were sold. Looking more closely, the supply of good quality cloth increased even faster than that of poor quality cloth. Taking the better quality floral fine cloth as an example, the sales volume in 1953 was equal to 316% of that in 1952, and the sales volume in the first half of 1954 exceeded 292% of the sales volume in 1953.

    What do these figures indicate? They show that the purchasing power of farmers has indeed increased. The gradual recovery and development of agricultural production in the years since liberation is certainly the main reason for the increase in farmers' purchasing power; the increase in the price of agricultural products and the decrease in the price of industrial products are also important reasons for the rapid increase in farmers' purchasing power. Look at the following figures: In 1951, the price of grain was 43,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), and the price of blue fine cloth was 4,500 yuan per chi (unit of length). One shi of grain could only be exchanged for 9.5 chi of cloth. In 1952, the price of grain increased to 48,000 yuan per shi, while the price of blue fine cloth dropped to 4,200 yuan per chi, and one shi of grain could be exchanged for 11.4 chi of cloth. In 1953, the price of grain increased again to 57,500 yuan per shi, and the price of blue fine cloth dropped to 3,700 yuan per chi, and one shi of grain could be exchanged for 15.5 chi of cloth.

    We visited several villages in Longtang Township, where the main products are rice and sideline production is mainly pig raising. The living conditions of the masses here can represent the living conditions of the general hilly area masses.

    Walking into the village, we saw that most of the men were wearing blue Shilin cloth trousers and jackets, and the women were wearing shirts of various floral fabrics. There were a few people wearing patched clothes, but most of them were just returning from working in the fields. Section Chief Tan, who took me there, was very familiar with the area. He pointed to a farmer working in the field, whose clothes had several patches, and said to me: "Clothes like these are considered the worst. After finishing work, they still have clothes to change into. Before liberation, such ragged clothes were hard to come by!"

    Farmers use "a dwarf climbing stairs, rising step by step, rising faster and faster" to describe their lives after liberation. Hired farmhand Li Huaide used to wear patches upon patches, and even wore clothes that others didn't want. Buying a new pair of shoes for the New Year (Spring Festival) was also not an easy task. A lined jacket he made when he was thirteen years old was worn until he was twenty-five. Now? He wears "blue is blue, and blue is blue," and his wife and children also wear floral cloth clothes. Speaking of the improvement in his life in recent years, a happy and satisfied expression immediately appeared on Li Huaide's face. He told us that the food and housing were very different from the past. He carefully counted the clothes he had added year by year: In 1951, the whole family only made clothes with 31 chi of cloth. In 1952, they made clothes with 74 chi of cloth. In 1953, they made clothes with 95 chi of cloth. In 1951, Li Huaide only made himself a white fine cloth jacket. In 1952, he started wearing worker-peasant blue cloth and blue fine cloth.

    Poor peasant Liu Zhengming excitedly told me that his family members have now begun to wear clothes made of poplin and serge fabrics. His family used only 60 chi of cloth in 1951, 106 chi of cloth in 1952, and 151 chi of cloth in 1953. Before liberation, it took several years to make a set of clothes. Now, those who didn't have cotton-padded jackets have made cotton-padded jackets, and those who didn't have lined jackets have made lined jackets. Unlike before, when "cold" and "hot" clothes were not separated, now "cold is cold, and hot is hot," and there are changes of clothes for both the cold and hot seasons.

    Among the more than 20 households I contacted, none of them said that their lives had not improved and that the amount of cloth they used had increased year by year.

    Farmers see the continuous improvement of their lives since liberation as the benefits of the revolution, attributing it to the "good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." From their own personal experiences, they expressed great trust and support for the policy of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth.

    Farmers have suffered enough from price fluctuations and private merchants' speculation before liberation. At that time, when merchants in the city saw "villagers" coming to buy cloth, they would ask for a high price. After much bargaining, the farmers ended up paying a price one or two times higher than the actual price, and the farmers still suffered. When the farmers didn't have enough money, the merchants would say, "That's easy, I also want new grain!" The price of grain was suppressed again and again, and after a price was made, the farmers gritted their teeth and made a note to exchange for new grain. After the autumn harvest, one shi of new grain had to be added with one *hu* (two and a half *dou*) or three *dou* of interest to buy cloth. But the "villagers" couldn't recognize the quality of the goods. The merchants tore off the brand names on the cloth ends and used glue to make the cloth surface look shiny. Originally, they bought medium-quality goods, but when they came back, they were the worst goods. That's not all. The merchants used "old *chi* in, market *chi* out," and also used "deducting *chi*," or stretched the cloth tighter when measuring, pretending to say: "Thank you for your patronage, first time is unfamiliar, second time is familiar, add two *cun*." But when they measured it back home, one *chi* of cloth was only nine and a half *cun*.

    Farmers cited one fact after another. One year before liberation, Wang Xiuying wanted to wear good clothes to eat "wedding wine" because her brother was getting married. So she got some cotton and spun it day and night, weaving it into homespun cloth. She sold the homespun cloth and got a sum of money, and ran to Changsha City, dozens of miles away, to buy blue cloth. The money from 30 *chi* of homespun cloth only bought back 9 *chi* of blue cloth. Hearing people say that blue Shilin cloth with white edges doesn't fade, she kept it firmly in her heart and bought it home. After washing it for the first time, the water was blue, and after drying, the color was dark in one place and light in another. Farmers described the cloth price situation in the market at that time as: "Can't afford three days, can't afford three days." Meaning: if there is a lot of cloth on the market, the price will drop immediately. If there is little cloth on the market, the price will rise immediately. Paper money is like water, and countless people have suffered from this! They suffered this pain, so when they learned that the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth could stabilize prices and eliminate the benefits of speculation, they all said: The method the state is thinking of is really for us.

    Liu Xiaochu, who sold two *shi* of new grain to merchants at a low price before the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, said: "The People's Government does everything for the people. In the first half of last year, those with a lot of grain raised the price of grain, sold old grain at a high price, and bought new grain at a low price, exchanging one *shi* for two or three *shi*. Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, I have not heard of anyone selling new grain this year." The members of the Chen Jian mutual aid group told me: Some wealthy people in the countryside make a second or third set of clothes before they have even worn out a set of clothes, and some even hoard cloth. Now the state sells cloth to us according to plan, every year, everyone has it, on time and on schedule, so there will be no time when you have money but can't buy cloth. They feel that the unified sale of cotton cloth guarantees their use of cloth.

    Will the amount of cloth used by farmers be reduced compared to last year after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth? No, farmers can still buy more cotton cloth than last year. Take Li Huaide as an example. His family has a strong labor force, his life is improving quickly, and he has used more cloth in the past. Even for such farmers, the planned supply of cloth is still more than last year. Last year, his family of six used 95 *chi* of cloth, and from now until August next year, the government will supply him with 102 *chi* of cloth. Is it enough to wear? Let's take Li Huaide as an example again. He plans to make a pair of trousers for his mother this winter, make a jacket and two pairs of trousers for himself, make a pair of trousers for his wife, make a set of jacket for his younger brother, make a padded jacket and a jacket for his son; make a jacket and a pair of trousers for his daughter, which will require more than 50 *chi* of cloth in total. The state plans to supply his family with 66 *chi* of cloth from now until February next year.

    Because they understand the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth, farmers are using practical actions to support this policy. Many people in this area are already planning how to save cloth. Wang Xiuying has an old cotton-padded jacket that she has worn for several years. She originally planned to make a new one this winter. After the cotton cloth unified purchase and sale policy was promoted, she plans to mend it and wear it for another year. She said: "We don't produce cotton here. Saving some cotton cloth means I am supporting the country's industrial construction."

    农民拥护棉布统销政策
    见初
    黄花市是长沙县二区的一个小镇子。一九五三年以来，特别是今年上半年以来，每天清早，镇的区供销合作社门市部便聚满了来自四面八方的农民顾客。过去冷冷静静的镇子变得热闹起来了。
    “农民不单单吃得好了，而且讲究穿了。”合作社的干部对我说。他怕我不相信似的，热情地打开账本给我看。一九五二年合作社供应的各种布匹仅一千四百二十四匹，一九五三年增加到三千九百一十一匹，而一九五四年上半年就销售了三千零三十三匹。再细细一看，质量好的布比质量差的布的供应量增加得更快。拿质量较好的花细布来说，一九五三年的销售量等于一九五二年的百分之三百一十六，而一九五四年上半年的销售量就超过了一九五三年销售量的百分之二百九十二。
    上面这些数字说明了什么呢？它说明农民的购买力确实提高了。解放后几年来农业生产的逐年恢复和发展，固然是农民购买力提高的主要原因；农业产品价格的提高和工业品价格的降低，也是农民购买力迅速提高的重要原因之一。看看下面这个数字吧：一九五一年谷价四万三千元一石，青细布价四千五百元一尺，一石谷只换九尺五寸布；一九五二年谷价提高到四万八千元一石，而青细布价却降到四千二百元一尺，一石谷可以换十一尺四寸布；一九五三年谷价又提高到五万七千五百元一石，青细布价降到三千七百元一尺，一石谷可以换十五尺五寸布了。
    我们访问过垅塘乡几个村子，这里主要出产稻谷，副业生产主要是喂猪，群众的生活状况可以代表一般丘陵地区群众的生活状况。
    走进村子，我们看到，男人多穿着青色的、蓝色的士林布裤褂，妇女们穿着各色各样的花布衬衫。有少数穿打补钉衣服的人，但多半是刚从田里做工回来的。引我去的谭区长很熟悉这一带的情况，他指着一个在田里工作、衣上有几个补钉的农民对我说：“像这样的衣服算是最烂的了，做完工，还有衣换。在解放以前，这样的烂衣衫是求都求不到啊！”
    农民用“矮子上楼梯，步步高升，越升越快”来形容解放后自己的生活。雇农李怀德，过去穿的是补钉加补钉，别人不要了的衣服还拿来穿，做双新鞋子过年（春节），也是一件不容易的事。十三岁时做的一件夹衣，一直穿到二十五岁。现在呢？穿得“青是青，蓝是蓝”，妻子和小孩也穿上花布衣了。说起这几年来生活改善的情形，李怀德的脸上立刻呈现出一种幸福的满意的神情。他告诉我们，吃的、住的和过去比是大不相同了。他仔细地数着一年一年添置的衣服：一九五一年，全家只做了三十一尺布的衣服，一九五二年做了七十四尺布的衣服，一九五三年就做了九十五尺布的衣服了。一九五一年，李怀德自己只做一件白细布褂子，到一九五二年就开始穿工农蓝布和青细布了。
    贫农柳政明兴奋地告诉我，他家里的人现在已开始穿府绸、哔叽布料的衣服了。他一家人一九五一年还只用六十尺布，一九五二年就用了一百零六尺布，到一九五三年就用了一百五十一尺布。解放以前要好几年才做一身衣服，如今，没有棉袄的做了棉袄，没有夹衣的做夹衣了，不像以前“冷”“热”衣服不分，如今是“冷是冷，热是热”，冷热两季都有换洗衣服了。
    在我接触到的二十多户人家里，没有哪个不说生活改善了、自己用布的数量一年比一年加多了。
    农民把解放以来自己生活的不断改善看成是革命的好处，归功于“共产党和毛主席领导得好”。从自己的亲身体验中，他们对棉布统购统销政策表示了极大的信任和拥护。
    农民们受够了解放前物价波动和私商的投机倒把的痛苦。那时候城里的商人看到“乡里人”来买布，开口就要个大价，七讨八还，结果农民出个比实价还贵一、二成的价钱，还是农民吃亏。农民手里钱不够了，商人便说：“那好办，新谷我也要！”谷价一压再压，作了个价，农民咬紧牙关打个兑新谷的条子，一石新谷秋收后还要加一戽（二斗五升）或是三斗的利息，买了布。但“乡里人”认不清货色，商人把布头子上的牌号扯掉，用胶水把布面淌得光光的。原来买的是中等货，回来便是最差的货了。这还不算。商人“老尺进，市尺出”，还来个“扣尺”，或是把布扯紧些量，装腔作势地说：“承蒙光顾，一回生，二回熟，加二寸。”但是拿回来一量，一尺布只有九寸五。
    农民举出一件又一件的事实。解放前的一年，王秀英看哥哥要结婚，想穿件好衣吃“喜酒”。于是弄到一些棉花，日纺夜纺，织成土布。她把土布卖了，得了一笔钱，跑到几十里路远的长沙市买蓝布。三十尺土布的钱只买回九尺蓝布。听人家说扯白口子的蓝士林布不退色，她便牢记在心里，照样买回家来，洗头一次，水是蓝澄澄的，晒干后颜色深一块，浅一块。农民形容那时市场上布价的情形说：“有不得三天，冒不得三天。”意思是说：市场上布多，就马上跌价，市场上布少，又马上涨价。票子如水，不知多少人吃过这个亏！他们身受这个痛苦，因而当他们知道棉布统购统销能稳定物价，消灭投机的好处后，都说：国家想的办法真是为了我们。
    曾在实行粮食统购统销前，低价出卖两石新谷给商人的柳晓初说：“人民政府样样为人民。去年上半年，有谷多的人抬高谷价，高价卖出陈谷，低价买进新谷，一石换进两三石。自从实行了粮食统购统销，今年我便没有听见有人卖新谷了。”陈健互助组的组员告诉我：乡下有些钱多的人，一身衣还没有穿烂，又做第二身、第三身衣服，有的还把布囤积起来。现在国家按计划卖布给我们，年年有，人人有，按时按节到，就不会有钱时买不到布了。他们觉得棉布统销使自己用布有了保证。
    是不是实行棉布统购统销，农民的用布数量会比去年减少呢？不，农民还可以买到比去年还要多的棉布。就拿李怀德为例。他家劳动力较强，生活上升得快，往年布用得也较多。就是这样的农户，计划供应的布也还比去年多。去年他一家六口人，用了九十五尺布，而从现在到明年八月，政府将供应他一百零二尺布。够不够穿呢？还是拿李怀德来说，他准备今年冬天给妈妈做一条裤子，自己做一件罩褂子、二条裤子，妻子做一条裤子，弟弟做一身罩衣，男孩做一件袄，一件罩褂子；女孩做一件罩衣，一条裤子，总共需要布五十多尺，而国家从现在起到明年二月止，计划供应给他一家的布就有六十六尺布。
    正因为懂得了棉布统购统销的好处，农民们便用实际行动拥护这个政策。这区不少人已在盘算如何节约用布了。王秀英有一件旧棉袄，已经穿了几年，原来准备今年冬天做件新的，棉布统购统销政策宣传以后，她准备把它补好，再穿一年。她说：“我们这里不产棉花，节省一些棉布，也就是我支持了国家工业建设。”
