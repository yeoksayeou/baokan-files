Dear comrades!

First of all, please allow me to express my gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to the Hungarian Government Delegation during its stay in China.

During this time, we have personally witnessed how the liberated Chinese people are resolutely and tenaciously building their motherland and a happy future. The talented Chinese people with a long cultural tradition are finally able to use their wisdom and strength for their own benefit. We have seen this both at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and in the production cooperatives near Beijing and Shanghai. At the same time, we are convinced that the Chinese people are not only able to use their freedom, but are also always ready to defend it. Wherever we have been, we have felt that the Chinese working people attach great importance to and cherish their freedom, and deeply love their People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and the great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. When we visited the "Red Star" production cooperative in Zhudi Township near Shanghai, a child, in answering the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?", said: "I want to defend the motherland." He expressed the Chinese people's love for their motherland in such a simple but very appropriate way.

What excites us very much is that we feel everywhere the Chinese people's love for the people of the elder brother, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union not only connects our two countries geographically, but also the sincere love of the Chinese and Hungarian people for the Soviet people makes the friendship between our two peoples closer and deeper.

Once again, I express my gratitude on behalf of the Hungarian Government Delegation for the warm welcome and hospitality it has received. As we bid farewell, I wish the Chinese people even greater achievements in the cause of strengthening and developing the People'

    匈牙利政府代表团团长赫格居斯讲话亲爱的同志们！
    首先请允许我对匈牙利政府代表团在中国逗留期间所受到的盛情款待表示感谢。
    在这期间，我们亲眼看到了获得解放的中国人民是如何坚决和顽强地建设着自己的祖国和幸福的未来。富有才干和悠久文化传统的中国人民终于能为自己的利益发挥他们的智慧和力量。无论是在鞍山钢铁公司，或是在北京、上海近郊的生产合作社，我们都看到了这一点。同时我们深信：中国人民不仅能够运用自己的自由，而且还随时准备着保卫自己的自由。凡是我们到过的地方，我们都感觉到：中国劳动人民非常重视和珍贵自己的自由，深深地热爱自己的人民共和国、中国共产党和伟大的领袖——毛泽东同志。在我们参观上海近郊诸翟乡“红星”生产合作社的时候，一个小孩在回答“你将来要做什么”这个问题时说：“我要保卫祖国。”他就这样简单地但又十分恰当地表达了中国人民对自己祖国的热爱。
    令我们感到十分兴奋的是，我们到处都感觉到中国人民对老大哥苏联人民的热爱。苏联不仅在地理上把我们两国联接在一起，并且，中匈人民对苏联人民的真诚热爱使得我们两国人民之间的友谊更加密切和深厚起来。
    我再一次代表匈牙利政府代表团对它所受到的盛情欢迎和款待，表示感谢。在我们告别的时候，谨祝中国人民在加强和发展中华人民共和国的事业中，获得更大的成就！
    中匈两国人民之间的友谊万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    和平阵营及其领导力量——苏联万岁！
