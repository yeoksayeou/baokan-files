Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 25th: A series of meetings held in Paris by Western countries to implement the London Conference's plan to rearm West Germany has concluded. Under the manipulation of the United States, these meetings have drafted specific plans to establish West German aggressive forces within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

At the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany on October 21st, an agreement was reached on abolishing the "Occupation Statute" for West Germany. At the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and West Germany on the 21st, an agreement was reached to expand the Brussels Treaty into a "Western European Union" with the participation of West Germany and Italy. At the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers and Defense Ministers of the fourteen North Atlantic Treaty countries on the 22nd, an agreement was reached to absorb West Germany into this aggressive military alliance. On the 23rd, representatives of the countries concerned signed many documents formulated on the above-mentioned agreements. However, whether these agreements will take effect depends on whether the parliaments of the countries concerned will ratify them.

The Paris agreements have opened the way to revive German militarism. If these agreements are implemented, a West German army of 500,000 men will be established immediately. The peaceful reunification of the German nation will become impossible for a long time, and the peace and security of the entire Europe will be seriously threatened.

Western diplomats boast that the agreements signed in Paris have restored West Germany's "sovereignty," but in reality, what West Germany has gained is only the right to be armed and provide cannon fodder for foreign imperialism. The Paris agreement on abolishing the "Occupation Statute" not only does not mean the withdrawal of the occupying forces, but on the contrary, stipulates that the occupation by the United States, Britain, and France will continue until 1998. The number of occupying troops can also be increased at any time. West Germany will still be bound by the enslaving "Bonn Treaty" until the end of this century.

After the London Conference, the French ruling group vigorously promoted West Germany's participation in the Brussels Treaty as a guarantee that French security would not be threatened by a revived West German army. But the results of the Paris Conference show that such guarantees are merely empty illusions. The plan proposed by French Prime Minister Mendès France at the London Conference to establish an "arms pool organization" to supervise West German arms production and distribute American aid weapons was not taken seriously at the Paris Conference and was postponed for future discussion, although, as the United Press said, Mendès France had "tried hard to sell" his "proud" plan.

While the foreign ministers of the Western countries were meeting in Paris, French Prime Minister Mendès France and West German Chancellor Adenauer also held negotiations on the status of the Saar. Only under great pressure from the United States and other NATO countries did France and West Germany reach an agreement on the morning of the 23rd, the last minute before the signing of the Paris agreements. According to this agreement, the German territory of the Saar, which has been under French control since the war, will continue to be separated from Germany and ruled by an administrator entrusted by the "Western European Union." French newspapers pointed out that the French ruling group used the dispute over the Saar issue to attract public opinion so that they would not pay attention to the rearmament of West Germany, which was the focus of the Paris Conference. "L'Humanité" wrote that West Germany entered NATO "under the guise of a smokescreen" of the Saar issue.

Now, the ruling groups of the various countries that have undertaken obligations at the Paris Conference are planning to do everything possible to ensure that the Paris agreements are ratified by their respective parliaments as soon as possible, fearing that these agreements will suffer the same fate as the "European Defense Community" after their sinister nature is fully exposed. They know that the opposition of the peace-loving people of all countries can bankrupt these painstakingly crafted schemes. A dispatch from Washington by the United Press on the day the Paris agreements were signed said: "The time before these agreements are ratified—estimated at two or three months—will be a time of unease for Western governments."

### 西方国家在巴黎签订几个武装西德的协定

    西方国家在巴黎签订几个武装西德的协定
    【新华社二十五日讯】巴黎消息：西方国家为贯彻伦敦会议关于重新武装西德的计划而在巴黎举行的一系列会议已经结束。在美国的操纵之下，这些会议已经拟定了在北大西洋集团体系内建立西德侵略军队的各项具体计划。
    在十月二十一日举行的美、英、法、西德四国外交部长会议上，就取消对西德“占领法规”达成了协议。在二十一日的美、英、法、意、加、荷、比、卢、西德九国外交部长会议上，就把布鲁塞尔条约扩大为有西德和意大利参加的“西欧联盟”达成了协议；在二十二日的北大西洋公约十四国外交部长、国防部长理事会会议上，就吸收西德参加这个侵略性军事同盟达成协议。二十三日，有关各国的代表们在就上述各项协议制定的许多文件上签了字。但是，这些协议是否生效将视有关各国议会是否予以批准而定。
    巴黎会议的协议已经打开了复活德国军国主义的道路。如果这些协议得到实现，一支五十万人的西德军队就将马上建立起来。德国民族的和平统一就将在一个长时期内成为不可能，而整个欧洲的和平与安全就将受到严重的威胁。
    西方的外交家们吹嘘在巴黎签字的协议已经恢复了西德的“主权”，但是实际上西德所得到的只是武装起来为外国帝国主义供应炮灰的权利。巴黎会议关于取消“占领法规”的协议不但并不意味着占领军的撤退，而且相反地规定美、英、法三国的占领要一直继续到一九九八年。占领军的数目还可以随时增加。西德将仍旧处在奴役性的“波恩条约”的束缚下，一直到本世纪的末年。
    法国统治集团在伦敦会议之后，曾经竭力宣传使西德参加布鲁塞尔条约，就是有了使法国安全不受复活了的西德军队威胁的保证。但是巴黎会议的结果表明这样的保证只是虚妄的幻想。法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在伦敦会议上提出的关于建立一个
  “军备共储机构”，以监督西德武器生产并分配美援武器的计划，在巴黎会议并没有得到重视而被推迟到以后去讨论。虽然如合众社所说：孟戴斯—弗朗斯曾“竭力推销”他这个“得意的”计划。
    当各西方国家外长在巴黎举行会议的时候，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯和西德总理阿登纳还举行了关于萨尔地位问题的谈判。只是在美国和北大西洋集团其他各国使用了极大的压力之下，法国和西德双方才在二十三日早晨，也就是在这次巴黎会议各项协议签字前的最后一分钟达成了协议。根据这个协议，战后一直在法国控制下的德国领土萨尔今后将继续和德国分裂而由“西欧联盟”委托的行政长官统治。法国报纸指出：法国统治集团曾利用了对萨尔问题的争执来吸引舆论，使它们不去注意作为巴黎会议的中心的西德重新武装问题。“义勇军报”写道：西德是在萨尔问题的“烟幕的伪装”下进入北大西洋集团的。
    现在，在巴黎会议上承担了义务的各个国家的统治集团，正在打算尽一切力量使巴黎会议的各项协议能尽快地得到本国议会的批准，他们害怕这些协议在其罪恶实质得到充分暴露以后将遭到像“欧洲防务集团”一样的命运。他们知道爱好和平的各国的人民的反对是能使这些费尽心机编制起来的诡计归于破产。合众社在巴黎协议签字那天从华盛顿发出的电讯说：“批准这些协定前的这段时间——估计有两三个月——将是西方政府感到不安的时间。”
