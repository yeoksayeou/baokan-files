    The workers building the First Automobile Works overfulfilled the September construction task.

    The September construction task for the First Automobile Works was the most arduous month since construction began this year, with the workload for the entire month accounting for 17.6% of the annual plan. In celebration of the convening of the National People's Congress and in anticipation of National Day, all employees enthusiastically launched a labor emulation campaign. Young workers, under the call of the Party committee, formed youth shock brigades, playing a leading role. The Youth Shock Brigade of Engineering Area 104 overfulfilled the state plan every day in seven consecutive complex concrete pouring projects. The Youth Shock Brigade of Engineering Area 105 set a new record in bricklaying, averaging 2,655 bricks per person per day, exceeding the state quota by 178%. In terms of construction management, leaders at all levels strengthened planning management and went deep into the construction site to understand the construction situation. For example, the head of the Mechanized Supply Station and the chief engineer personally went to the site to understand the construction situation, greatly improving the vehicle dispatch rate and operating time utilization rate in September.

    Currently, all the workers building the First Automobile Works are working intensely to complete the annual task. (Gao Guangting)

    The Daye Steel Plant's expansion of the open hearth furnace project completed 139% of the September plan, with the quality meeting standards, setting a new record since construction began.

    In September, all employees took practical actions to celebrate the convening of the National People's Congress and in anticipation of National Day, proposing guarantees and enthusiastically launching a labor emulation campaign.

    All the workers of the five-ton pile driver and the crane workers learned from each other, cooperated closely, and improved operating methods, quickly reversing the previous phenomenon of not being able to complete one pile in three days, creating a new record of completing four piles in one day, allowing the September plan to be completed one week ahead of schedule. The ton-and-a-half pile driver also completed the September task two days ahead of schedule.

    The concrete pouring of the two central pillars of the open hearth furnace plant was also completed ahead of schedule. In the pouring process, the concrete workers and the stone washing and sand sifting workers overcame many difficulties. On average, all concrete workers exceeded the quota by 8% per person per day, with the highest reaching over 50%; the sand sifting workers averaged 6.7 cubic meters per person per day, exceeding the quota by over 70%; the stone washing workers increased from 1.3 cubic meters to 1.9 cubic meters per person per day, exceeding the quota by 0.5 cubic meters; the laborers, within a transport distance of 100 meters, averaged 100 loads of earth per person per day, up from 70 loads (the quota), with the highest reaching 140 loads.

    Currently, all the workers on the construction site are full of confidence in striving to complete and overfulfill the October plan. (Zhou Ti)

    第一汽车制造厂九月份施工任务超额完成
    大冶钢厂扩建平炉工程九月份计划超额完成
    建设第一汽车制造厂的职工们，超额完成了九月份施工任务。
    第一汽车制造厂九月份的施工任务是今年开工以来最繁重的一个月份，全月工作量占全年计划的百分之十七点六。全体职工在庆祝全国人民代表大会会议的召开和迎接国庆节的日子里，热烈地展开了劳动竞赛。青年职工在党委的号召下纷纷组成了青年突击班，发挥了带头作用。一○四工区青年突击班在连续七次浇灌复杂的混凝土工程中，每天都超额完成了国家计划。一○五工区青年突击班在砌砖工程中创造了最高纪录，每人一天平均砌砖两千六百五十五块，超过国家定额百分之一百七十八。在施工管理方面，各级领导都加强了计划管理，并深入工地了解施工情况。如机械化供应站的站长和主任工程师亲自到现场了解施工情况，使九月份的出车率和台时利用率有很大提高。
    现在，建设第一汽车制造厂的全体职工，正为完成全年任务而紧张地劳动着。　　（高光汀）
    大冶钢厂扩建平炉工程，九月份完成计划百分之一百三十九，质量合乎标准，创开工以来新纪录。
    九月份，全体职工以实际行动庆祝全国人民代表大会会议的召开和迎接国庆节，纷纷提出保证，热烈地开展了劳动竞赛。
    五吨打桩机全体工人和起高工互相学习，紧密配合，改进操作方法，迅速扭转了过去三天完不成一根桩的现象，创造了一天打完四根桩的新纪录，使九月份计划提前一星期完成。吨半打桩机也提前了二天完成九月份任务。
    平炉厂房的二个中心柱子的混凝土浇灌工作也提前完成了。在浇灌中，混凝土工人和洗石子、筛砂子的工人们都克服了很多困难。全部混凝土工人平均每人每天超过定额百分之八，最高到百分之五十以上；筛砂工平均每人每天达六点七方，超过定额百分之七十以上；洗石子工每人每天由一点三方提高到一点九方，超过定额零点五方；民工们在离一百公尺的运距内，每人每天平均由挑土七十担
  （定额数）到一百担，最高到一百四十担。
    现在，工地上全体职工正满怀信心争取完成和超额完成十月份计划。　　（周　惕）
