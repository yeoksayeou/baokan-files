    How to Organize Typical Thought Discussions
    Yu Wen
    In the past few years, many newspapers have adopted the method of typical thought discussion in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. In the process of vigorously publicizing the Party's general line during the transition period, many newspapers also launched typical thought discussions in order to conduct this publicity in a more in-depth and vivid manner. Well-organized discussions have proven to be a very effective way to guide the masses in using democratic methods to conduct self-education and self-transformation, and a vivid and powerful way for newspapers to conduct ideological education and ideological struggle. Many newspapers have accumulated some experience in organizing typical thought discussions. Studying and accepting these experiences will be helpful for us to better organize such discussions in the future.
    According to the experience of many newspapers, to carry out typical thought discussions in newspapers, it is necessary to grasp the main ideological problems that are common among the masses and closely integrate them with the current practical work. Only in this way can we attract the broad masses to actively participate, gain the strong support and full cooperation of leading organs at all levels, so that the discussions can be carried out extensively and deeply, and become a force to promote current work.
    Here is an example of the discussion organized by the Hebei Daily on "How should rural party members treat agricultural producers' cooperatives (i.e., the two different thoughts of party members Tian Jingxiu and Qiao Duokui)." After vigorously publicizing the general line last winter and this spring, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Hebei Province has greatly developed. By March of this year, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives had increased from more than 3,000 to more than 31,000. In the great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, many rural Communist Party members actively took the lead in joining agricultural producers' cooperatives. However, because rural party members have lived the lives of small producers for a long time, many of them have not completely overcome the ideological consciousness of small-scale farmers. Some party members joined the cooperatives by "following the crowd," and showed passivity and wavering after joining, and some even withdrew. A very small number of party members joined the cooperatives in order to "take advantage," and even engaged in phenomena that damaged the cooperatives in order to take advantage. Solving these ideological problems of rural party members and educating them to correctly treat agricultural producers' cooperatives is not only an important key to consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives at that time, but also a major issue in the ideological construction of the rural party. Therefore, the ideological discussion launched by the Hebei Daily in late March through the two different attitudes of rural party members Tian Jingxiu and Qiao Duokui towards agricultural producers' cooperatives received active support from party organizations and rural cadres in various places, and attracted the close attention of the broad masses of party members. For example, more than 92% of party branches in Quyang County participated in this discussion; all rural party members in Hejian County, except those who were sick or away, participated in the discussion. After discussion, many party members further recognized the difference between the socialist and capitalist roads, gained a deeper understanding of the important responsibilities of party members in realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, and established a correct attitude towards agricultural producers' cooperatives, thereby powerfully promoting the consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the then agricultural production work. However, the experience of Hebei Daily in organizing this discussion also shows that because the time to launch this discussion was slightly later, it was not more closely integrated with the work of consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places. In the later stage of the discussion, many areas turned to other work and relatively relaxed the leadership of this discussion, thus affecting the further expansion of the publicity effect. Other newspapers have the same experience, that is, if the typical thought discussion cannot grasp the main ideological problems of the masses or is not closely integrated with the current work, it cannot produce better results. This experience is undoubtedly worthy of our attention.
    Carrying out typical thought discussions in newspapers is done through typical figures representing certain ideologies. Therefore, correctly selecting typical examples is very important for the effectiveness of the discussion. Comrade Malenkov, in his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, once said: "The typical is not only the most common thing, but also the thing that most fully and sharply expresses the essence of a certain social force." This also points out the principles that our newspapers should follow in selecting typical examples for ideological discussion.
    The discussion organized by Hebei Daily selected two typical ideologies, advanced and backward, and展开了discussed them in comparison. In this way, when criticizing what is wrong, it simultaneously tells rural party members what is right in a vivid way. This is a method that is relatively easy to achieve publicity effects in the current situation where most rural party members have a low level of political and cultural literacy and a poor ability to accept. Of course, this does not mean that in order to have such a good and bad example, one can forcibly piece it together, or even fabricate it out of thin air. Some experiences and lessons of the "Xiang Zhanmei Thought" discussion organized by New Hunan Daily and the "Wang Benzheng Thought" discussion organized by Henan Daily are also of educational significance to us. Xiang Zhanmei was originally a poor peasant in Wulian Township, Pingjiang County. He was allocated land during the land reform, and later engaged in diligent production under the leadership of the People's Government, and soon rose to the level of middle peasant. At this time, Xiang Zhanmei used the surplus grain and money to buy new grain for usury, and also planned to hoard grain to buy land and hire long-term workers to live a wealthy peasant exploitative life. In November last year, he received education on the general line. After intense ideological struggle, he realized that in the past he had "taken the wrong path" by exploiting everyone for his personal wealth and enjoyment. He then sold 3,000 catties of surplus grain to the state, actively participated in mutual aid groups, and was determined to take the socialist road of common prosperity. Xiang Zhanmei's ideological transformation not only profoundly reflected the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, illustrating that socialism can defeat capitalism; but also specifically revealed the essence of the duality of peasants, illustrating that the aspect of being a laborer is the basic and main aspect of our country's peasants. Because the typical example selected by New Hunan Daily is relatively complete and has comprehensive educational significance, this discussion, after being proposed by the newspaper, has had a profound impact on the broad masses of peasants. Many peasants compared their own thoughts with Xiang Zhanmei's thoughts before and after the transformation, improved their socialist consciousness, and expressed that they wanted to "learn from Xiang Zhanmei after the transformation." However, the "Wang Benzheng Thought" discussion carried out by Henan Daily failed to achieve the same effect due to the improper selection of typical examples. Wang Benzheng was a farmer with behaviors such as lending money, buying land, and hoarding grain. On the one hand, this typical example itself did not reflect the duality of the peasant, especially the spirit of the basic aspect of the peasant as a laborer; on the other hand, since Wang Benzheng was not a Communist Party member, the discussion did not distinguish between the different requirements of the party and non-party members in implementing the current social policies. Therefore, although this discussion was helpful to rural party members, district and township cadres, and some activists, it produced considerable negative effects, fueled the tendency of blindly criticizing spontaneous forces in the countryside, and made some cadres and peasants hate Wang Benzheng and people with "Wang Benzheng Thought." From this, it can be seen that the determination of typical examples for ideological discussion must be carefully considered and thoroughly investigated and studied, and must not be carried out hastily.
    Of course, newspapers can also separately select advanced or backward typical examples to carry out ideological discussions. However, when carrying out discussions on advanced typical examples, we must prevent the tendency of exaggerating individual roles; because exaggerating individual roles cannot truly improve people's thinking and achieve the goal of the advanced driving the backward and the backward catching up with the advanced. When carrying out discussions on backward typical examples, we must consider whether it is worth discussing publicly in the newspaper, and different policies should be adopted according to different situations. It is true that we should wage a relentless struggle against typical bad people and bad deeds, but we should adhere to the policy of persuasion and education for general ideological problems, otherwise we will make political mistakes. At the same time, we should also prevent the problem of objectivism in the discussion. Some articles published by Hebei Daily and some city newspapers and worker newspapers in Hebei Province in the discussion on the thought of worker Wang Dengfeng listed too many erroneous thoughts and remarks that are prone to causing misconceptions and misunderstandings, without giving due analysis and criticism; or exposed erroneous thoughts and remarks vividly, while conducting criticism simply and generally. This objectively publicized some erroneous thoughts and remarks, causing adverse effects among the masses. This objectivist problem must obviously be overcome.
    In order to ensure that typical thought discussions achieve good results, the editorial department should not only correctly decide on the theme of the discussion and choose appropriate typical examples, but also carry out a series of organizational work inside and outside the editorial department.
    First of all, we should seriously study how to carry out the discussion—the content of the discussion, the form adopted, the time required, the steps to be taken, etc.—and draw up a detailed plan. Experience has proved that strengthening the planning of the discussion can clarify the thinking of the personnel in charge of managing the discussion within the newspaper, take the initiative, and effectively carry out the work; it can guide the discussion not to be carried out dispersedly and disorderly, but centrally and systematically. Of course, even a relatively detailed plan often needs to be revised and supplemented according to the actual discussion situation and new problems that arise in the discussion. Any practice that does not attach importance to formulating a discussion plan, or treats the plan as something that is immutable and does not revise it according to real life, will affect the discussion from achieving its due effect.
    Secondly, throughout the entire process of carrying out the discussion, the editorial department should pay attention to organizing the editorial staff who manage the discussion to study relevant theories and policies. This is a key issue to ensure that the discussion can be carried out correctly and improve its ideological level. The experience of New Hunan Daily in organizing the "Xiang Zhanmei Thought" discussion shows that if the comrades who manage the discussion do not pay attention to studying the Party's policies, their thinking will not be very clear and their work will be quite passive; as long as they pay attention to studying the Party's policies, their thinking will be relatively clear and their work will be relatively active. Precisely because the editorial department of the newspaper did not study relevant theories and policies enough, the following shortcomings appeared in the discussion, that is, the criticism of the spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside mainly criticized the performance in the grain issue, but the criticism of other aspects was not enough; at the same time, the interrelationship of the four major economic tasks of transforming the small-scale economy (agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, credit cooperation, and the unified purchase and sale of grain and other major agricultural products) was not elaborated enough. Therefore, this discussion on the two roads in the countryside was not carried out fully enough and deeply enough. If the editorial department better organized the theoretical and policy study of the editorial staff, these shortcomings could be avoided.
    Thirdly, the editorial department should use great efforts to carry out mass work. Because carrying out typical thought discussions is a large-scale method of mass self-education, it is necessary to attract a wide range of readers to actively participate. Many newspapers not only conducted discussions on the newspaper, but also paid attention to mobilizing the masses in various places to discuss, so that the entire discussion had a more extensive mass character. For example, the "Comparison Discussion Meeting of the Socialist and Capitalist Roads in the Countryside" organized by Ningxia Daily, with the support of the CPC Ningxia Provincial Committee and party committees at all levels and the efforts of the editorial department, achieved a close integration of the discussion in the newspaper and the discussion of the masses, making the discussion in the newspaper actually form a large discussion meeting on the basis of thousands of small discussion meetings separately convened by the masses in various places. This not only expanded the influence of the discussion, but also greatly enriched and enriched the content of the discussion in the newspaper. In order to better guide the masses to participate in the discussion and guide the masses to correctly carry out the discussion, it is necessary for the editorial department to seize some key points to promote the general. When Hebei Daily carried out the discussion of "How should rural party members treat agricultural producers' cooperatives," it focused on the counties where Tian Jingxiu and Qiao Duokui were located—Shahe County and the suburbs of Baoding City near the newspaper office—and sent people to participate in the discussions of local rural party members to understand the ideological situation and discussion situation of rural party members, so as to guide the development of discussions in other regions. For example, the newspaper learned that some local party committees and cadres did not attach importance to organizing discussions because they were afraid of "affecting spring plowing production," so it introduced the practical example of the widespread discussion of party members in the fifth district of Shahe County, thereby promoting production, and published a short comment pointing out that carrying out this discussion was beneficial to promoting spring plowing production. For example, the newspaper learned that some party members said, "Since joining and leaving the cooperative is free, Qiao Duokui's withdrawal from the cooperative is not a mistake," and "Is it worth such a discussion for such a small matter as a party member withdrawing from the cooperative?" The newspaper published an article "A Rural Party Member's Withdrawal from the Cooperative is Not a Small Matter," and analyzed and criticized these vague understandings. The newspaper also published some commentaries guiding rural party members to correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism based on what it learned. Obviously, if the editorial department does not pay attention to carrying out mass work, it will not be able to fully understand the ideological situation of the masses and the problems that arise in the discussion, so as to give strong guidance to the discussion.
    Organizing typical thought discussions in newspapers is an effective way for newspapers to rely on and organize the strength of the masses under the leadership of the party committee to carry out large-scale struggles against bourgeois ideology and other erroneous ideologies. Because many newspapers have better organized this kind of discussion, they have greatly exerted the political enthusiasm of the masses, further strengthened the connection between the newspapers and the masses, improved the ideological and combat effectiveness of the newspapers, and made the newspapers full of vitality. This publicity method is worthy of being paid attention to and adopted by newspapers in various places according to the needs of actual work.

    怎样组织典型思想讨论
    于文
    几年来不少报纸在开展批评和自我批评中，曾经采用过典型思想讨论的方式。在大张旗鼓宣传党在过渡时期总路线的过程中，许多报纸为了深入地、生动地进行这一宣传，也曾开展过典型思想的讨论。组织得好的讨论都证明了，这是引导人民群众运用民主的方法进行自我教育和自我改造的一种极为有效的方式，也是报纸进行思想教育和思想斗争的一种生动有力的方式。许多报纸在组织典型思想讨论的实践中，已经积累了一些经验。把这些经验加以研究和接受，对于我们今后更好地组织这种讨论将是有帮助的。
    根据许多报纸的经验，在报纸上开展典型思想的讨论，必须抓住群众中普遍存在的主要思想问题，密切结合当前的实际工作进行。只有这样，才能吸引广大群众踊跃参加，才能取得各级领导机关的有力支持和充分配合，使讨论广泛深入地开展起来，并成为推动当前工作的一种力量。
    这里举河北日报组织的“农村党员应当怎样对待农业生产合作社（即党员田景秀和乔多奎两种不同思想）”的讨论为例。河北省经过去冬今春大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，互助合作运动有了很大的发展。到今年三月，农业生产合作社已由原来的三千多个增加到三万一千多个。在互助合作运动的大发展中，农村的许多共产党员积极带头加入了农业生产合作社。但由于农村党员长期过着小生产者的生活，他们之中不少人仍然没有完全克服农民小生产者的思想意识。有些党员因为是“随大流”入社的，入社后表现消极动摇，个别的竟退了社。极少数党员是为“贪占便宜”入社的，在入社后甚至发生为贪占便宜而破坏社的现象。解决农村党员的这些思想问题，教育他们正确地对待农业生产合作社，不仅是当时巩固农业生产合作社工作的一个重要关键，而且是农村党的思想建设中的一个重大问题。因此，河北日报在三月下旬通过田景秀和乔多奎两个农村党员对待农业生产合作社的两种不同态度所开展的思想讨论，就得到了各地党组织和农村干部的积极支持，吸引了广大党员的密切注意。如曲阳县就有百分之九十二以上的党支部参加了这次讨论；河间县的农村党员除去生病和外出的，全部参加了讨论。许多党员经过讨论进一步认清了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的不同，比较深刻地了解到党员在实现对农业的社会主义改造中的重大责任，树立了对待农业生产合作社的正确态度，从而有力地推动了农业生产合作社的巩固工作，并推动了当时的农业生产工作。但是河北日报组织这次讨论的经验也表明，由于开展这一讨论的时间稍晚了些，没有和各地巩固农业生产合作社的工作更紧密地结合，在讨论后期不少地区转入了其他工作，便相对地放松了对这一讨论的领导，因而影响了宣传效果的进一步扩大。其他报纸也有同样的经验，即开展典型思想讨论如果不能抓住群众的主要思想问题，或不同当前工作密切结合，就不能产生较好的效果。这个经验无疑是值得我们重视的。
    在报纸上开展典型思想讨论是通过代表某种思想的典型人物来进行的。因此，正确地选择典型，对于讨论的收效是很重要的。马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上谈到文艺创作的典型问题时，曾经说过：“典型不仅是最常见的事物，而且是最充分、最尖锐地表现一定社会力量的本质的事物。”这同样指出了我们报纸选择思想讨论的典型所应遵循的原则。
    河北日报组织的这次讨论，选择了先进的和落后的两种典型思想，对比着展开了讨论。这样，当批判什么是不对的时候，同时就以活的样子告诉农村党员什么是对的。这在目前大多数农村党员政治文化水平较低、接受能力较差的情况下，是比较容易收到宣传效果的一种作法。当然，这并不是说，为了要有这样一好一坏的典型，就可以强拉硬扯地拼凑，甚至于无中生有的去捏造。新湖南报组织的“向占梅思想”讨论和河南日报组织的“王本正思想”讨论，在选择典型上的一些经验教训，对于我们也是有教育意义的。向占梅原是平江县武莲乡的一个贫农，土地改革时分得了土地，以后在人民政府领导下勤劳生产，不久便上升为中农。这时向占梅就把余粮余钱用来买新谷放高利贷，还打算囤粮买地雇长工，过富农剥削的生活。去年十一月间，他受到了总路线的教育，经过激烈的思想斗争，认识到过去为了个人发财享福而剥削大家是“走错了路”，便把三千斤余粮卖给国家，积极参加了互助组，决心走大家富裕的社会主义道路。向占梅的思想转变不仅深刻地体现了农村中两条道路的斗争，说明了社会主义是可以战胜资本主义的；而且具体地揭示了农民的两重性的本质，说明了作为劳动者的一面是我国农民基本的主要的一面。正因为新湖南报所选择的这个典型比较完整，具有全面的教育意义，所以这一讨论经报纸提出后，便在广大农民中产生了深刻的影响。许多农民以自己的思想同转变前后的向占梅的思想相对照，提高了社会主义觉悟，表示要向“转变后的向占梅学习”。但是河南日报所开展的“王本正思想”讨论却由于典型选择的不恰当，而未能达到同样的效果。王本正是
  一个有放债、买地、囤粮等行为的农民。一方面，这个典型本身没有体现出农民的两重性，特别是没有体现出农民是劳动者的基本一面的精神；另一方面，由于王本正不是共产党员，在讨论中没有分清党内党外执行现行社会政策的不同要求，因此这一讨论虽然对农村党员、区乡干部和一部分积极分子有所帮助，但却产生了相当的消极作用，助长了农村中乱批评自发势力的偏向，并使得有些干部和农民仇视王本正和有“王本正思想”的人。由此可见，确定思想讨论的典型，必须经过慎重考虑和周密的调查研究，决不可草率从事。
    自然，报纸也可以分别选择先进的典型或落后的典型来开展思想讨论。但在开展关于先进典型的讨论时，必须防止夸大个人作用的偏向；因为夸大个人作用并不能真正提高人们的思想，达到先进带动落后，落后赶上先进的目的。在开展关于落后典型的讨论时，必须考虑有没有在报纸上公开讨论的价值，并应区别不同的情况采取不同的方针。对于典型的坏人坏事固然应当进行无情的斗争，但是对于一般性质的思想问题，却应当坚持说服教育的方针，否则就要在政治上犯错误。同时在讨论中还应当防止客观主义的毛病。河北日报和河北省某些市报、工人报在关于工人王登凤思想的讨论中所发表的某些文章，就过多地列举一些容易引起错觉和误解的错误思想和言论，而没有给以应有的分析批判；或者在暴露错误思想和言论时具体活现，而在进行批判时则简单笼统。这就在客观上替某些错误思想和言论做了宣传，在群众中造成不良的影响。这种客观主义的毛病显然是必须加以克服的。
    为了保证典型思想讨论收到良好的效果，编辑部不仅应当正确地决定开展讨论的主题和选择恰当的典型，而且应当在编辑部内外进行一系列的组织工作。
    首先应当对于如何开展讨论——讨论的内容，采用的形式，需要的时间，进行的步骤等等，加以认真研究，订出周密的计划。经验证明，加强了讨论的计划性，就可以使报社内部管理讨论的人员思想明确，掌握主动，有效地进行工作；就可以引导讨论不是分散地凌乱地而是集中地系统地进行。自然，即使是一个比较周密的计划，也常常需要根据实际讨论的状况和在讨论中出现的新问题加以修改和补充。任何不重视制订讨论计划，或将计划当作一成不变的东西而不根据现实生活进行修正的做法，都将影响讨论达不到应有的效果。
    其次，编辑部在开展讨论的整个过程中，应当注意组织管理讨论的编辑人员进行有关的理论政策的学习。这是保证讨论得以正确开展并提高其思想水平的一个关键问题。新湖南报组织“向占梅思想”讨论的经验就表明，管理讨论的同志，如果不注意钻研党的政策，思想就不大明确，工作就相当被动；只要注意了学习党的政策，思想就比较明确，工作就比较主动。正因为该报编辑部学习有关的理论政策不够，所以在讨论中就出现了以下的缺点，就是对农村资本主义自发势力主要只是批判了在粮食问题上的表现，至于其他方面的表现则批判得不够；同时对改造小农经济的四项主要经济工作
  （农业生产互助合作，供销合作，信用合作，粮食及其他主要农产品的统购统销）的相互关系也阐述得不够。因此这一关于农村两条道路问题的讨论还开展得不够充分，不够深刻。如果编辑部更好地组织编辑人员的理论政策学习，这些缺点是可以避免的。
    再次，编辑部应当以很大的力量来进行群众工作。由于开展典型思想讨论是一种大规模的群众自我教育的方式，必须吸引广大读者积极参加。许多报纸不仅在报面上进行讨论，还注意了发动各地群众讨论，因而使得整个讨论具有更加广泛的群众性。例如，宁夏日报所组织的“农村中社会主义和资本主义两条道路对比讨论会”，在中共宁夏省委及各级党委的支持和编辑部的努力下，做到了报纸上的讨论和群众的讨论密切结合，使得报纸上的讨论实际上形成各地群众分别召开的千百个小讨论会基础上的大讨论会。这就不仅扩大了讨论的影响，并且大大丰富和充实了报纸上的讨论内容。为了更好地引导群众参加讨论并指导群众正确地开展讨论，编辑部抓住一些重点借以推动一般是有必要的。河北日报在开展“农村党员应当怎样对待农业生产合作社”的讨论时，就曾以田景秀和乔多奎所在的县——沙河县和报社附近的保定市郊区为重点，派人下去参加当地农村党员的讨论，了解农村党员的思想情况和讨论情况，以便指导其他地区讨论的开展。例如，报纸了解到有些地区的党委和干部由于怕“影响春耕生产”而不重视组织讨论，就介绍了沙河县五区党员普遍开展讨论从而推动了生产的实际例子，并发表了短评，指出开展这一讨论对于推动春耕生产是有利的。又如，报纸了解到有些党员说什么“既然入社和出社自由，乔多奎退社就不算啥错误”，“一个党员退社这么一件小事情，也值得这样的讨论？”，就发表了“农村党员退社不是小事情”的文章，针对这种种模糊认识加以分析和批判。报纸并且根据所了解的情况，发表了
  一些指导农村党员正确地开展批评和自我批评的评论。显然，编辑部如果不重视进行群众工作，是不可能充分了解群众的思想情况和讨论中出现的问题，从而对讨论作有力的指导的。
    在报纸上组织典型思想讨论，这是报纸在党委领导下，依靠和组织群众的力量，向资产阶级思想以及其他错误思想进行大规模的斗争的一种有效方式。许多报纸由于较好地组织了这种讨论，就大大发挥了群众的政治积极性，进一步密切了报纸和群众的联系，提高了报纸的思想性和战斗性，并使得报纸富有生气。这一宣传方法是值得各地报纸根据实际工作的需要，加以注意和采用的。
