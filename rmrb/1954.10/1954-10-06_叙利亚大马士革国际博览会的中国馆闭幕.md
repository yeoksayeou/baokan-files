    叙利亚大马士革国际博览会的中国馆闭幕
    【新华社四日讯】大马士革消息：叙利亚大马士革国际博览会的中华人民共和国展览馆在十月一日闭幕。中国展览馆自九月十七日开幕以来，约有六十万人去参观，受到中东阿拉伯国家广大公众和报纸的欢迎和赞扬。中国展览馆的这一次展览促进了中国人民和叙利亚人民之间以及中国人民和阿拉伯国家人民之间的友谊和互相了解，同时也促进了贸易关系和商业联系。
    在展览期间到中国展览馆参观的有：叙利亚总统阿塔西、总理加齐、叙利亚政府各部部长和高级官员，黎巴嫩总理萨米·索勒哈，沙特阿拉伯的亲王，各国外交使节和宗教界领袖，以及来自叙利亚全国各地的各阶层人民和来自埃及、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、利比亚等中东其他国家的许多参观者。
    中国展览馆中陈列的两千多种展品，包括各种美丽的手工艺品、土特产和我国开始五年计划经济建设以来重工业方面的新产品等，反映了中国人民在新中国成立五年以来在经济建设方面的成就。这一切引起了参观者的极大兴趣。许多参观者在来宾意见簿上写下了他们自己的感想。
    叙利亚总统阿塔西写道：“我很喜欢这个展览馆”。黎巴嫩总理萨米·索勒哈写道：“我们对人民中国取得的进步和成就表示祝贺。”沙特阿拉伯驻叙利亚大使写道：我所看到的使我惊异，这证明中国已很快地取得了成就。我可以想见中国人民的极为美好的将来。
    叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党总书记巴克达斯写道：叙利亚人民、阿拉伯人民同人民中国之间的友谊万岁。世界上的任何自由人都愿意这个伟大的东方国家在世界上和在国际组织中取得应有的地位。
    叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家各阶层人民在意见簿上写下这些话：看到中国在解放后这几年中取得的进展很高兴；我从来没有看到像这次博览会中的中国馆这样美丽的展览馆；阿拉伯青年向中国欢呼：我们从心里欢迎建立我们和中华人民共和国的关系；中国馆所显示的不仅将为阿拉伯国家所体会，而且也是应该仿效的一个范例；我希望我们有商业上的来往。
    各报也报道了中国展览馆的消息。“呼声报”在“精美绝伦的艺术和新型重工业汇合在中国馆内”的标题下，对展览品作了详细和生动的叙述。
  “创造报”说：“展览品是完美的，许多群众都前往访问中国馆，盛况空前……这个共和国值得我们和它促进经济来往。”
    中国进出口公司的代表们在展览期间，和阿拉伯国家的工商界人士发生了广泛联系。他们不仅交换了关于促进中国和叙利亚贸易的意见，而且还进行了实际交易，签订了协定。
