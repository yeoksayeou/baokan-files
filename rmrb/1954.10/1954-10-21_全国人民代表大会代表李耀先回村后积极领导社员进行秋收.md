National People's Congress representative and head of the advanced agricultural production cooperative in Gaozhangzi Village, Lingyuan County, Rehe Province, Li Yaoxian, actively led cooperative members in the autumn harvest and prepared to sell good grain to the state after returning to the village from Beijing.

From the day Li Yaoxian returned to the village on the 8th, his home was crowded with cooperative members and neighboring farmers for three consecutive evenings. Li Yaoxian reported to everyone on the situation and achievements of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. The members of the advanced agricultural production cooperative also reported to Li Yaoxian on the implementation of the plan proposed by all the members to harvest 21,000 more catties of grain to celebrate the convening and success of the National People's Congress meeting. After Li Yaoxian went to Beijing, all the members immediately took action and re-cultivated the autumn ridges for beans and millet, making the crops grow strong. When the crops were ripe, the members launched a competition for careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that no bean pods were left behind and no millet ears were lost.

Currently, Li Yaoxian is leading the cooperative members to continue the autumn harvest and carefully compress and thresh the grain. In order to prevent the beans at the bottom of the pile from getting wet and sprouting, the members spread a layer of sorghum stalks at the bottom of the pile. The members have already threshed the good and bad crops separately and are actively preparing to pay agricultural taxes with good grain, and plan to sell 50,000 catties of surplus grain to the state.

    全国人民代表大会代表李耀先
    回村后积极领导社员进行秋收
    全国人民代表大会代表、热河省凌源县高杖子村先进农业生产合作社社长李耀先从北京回到村里后，积极领导社员进行秋收，准备把好粮卖给国家。
    从八日李耀先回到村里的那天起，一连三个晚上，他家里都挤满了合作社社员和邻近的农民。李耀先向大家报告了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的情况和成就。先进农业生产合作社的社员也向李耀先报告了全体社员为庆祝全国人民代表大会会议的召开和成功，提出多收二万一千斤粮食的计划的执行情况。全体社员在李耀先去北京后，马上行动起来，把豆子、谷子都放了一遍秋垅，使庄稼生长壮实。庄稼黄熟时，社员们展开了细收细打的竞赛，做到不剩一个豆荚，不丢一个谷穗。
    目前李耀先正领导着社员继续进行秋收，仔细压打粮食。为了避免堆底的豆粒受湿发芽，社员们在堆底铺上了一层秫秸。社员已把好坏庄稼分开脱粒，积极准备用好粮缴纳农业税，并准备把五万斤余粮卖给国家。
