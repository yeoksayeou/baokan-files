Major Developments in Fine Arts Work
Jiang Feng, National People's Congress Representative, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association

In the past five years, China's fine arts work has undergone significant development due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's literary and art policies. In these five years, over 15,000 pieces of various art works have been published in newspapers and magazines. These works reflect the tremendous changes in all aspects of China's social life. They closely coordinate with the current revolutionary struggles of the people, playing a significant role in stimulating the people's patriotism, labor enthusiasm, and promoting social reform movements. Go into the countryside, and you can see beautiful New Year pictures, one or several pasted on the walls of farmers' homes; in the cities, brightly colored political propaganda posters have become regular decorations in shop windows, workshops, and workers' clubs. Whether in cultural centers or clubs, in the trenches of battlefields and beside the seats of truck drivers, or in the schoolbags of elementary school students... there are often comic strip books. Due to the development of fine arts creation, art exhibitions are held more frequently each year; in Beijing alone, eight exhibitions have been held this year. The number of printed art works is enormous. From 1950 to 1954, the number of New Year pictures published was 191,287,000 copies, and the number of comic strip books was 89,554,000 copies.

With the increasingly close integration of fine arts and the people, the ranks of artists have greatly expanded. Under the call of the Party for fine arts to serve the people, the majority of artists have criticized the bourgeoisie's tendency to disregard politics, the masses, and life, as well as various forms of formalism in art. They have recognized the basic principle of realism in fine arts creation, which requires starting from the concrete life of the masses and their progressive demands. Artists have actively gone to factories, rural areas, and troops, participating in various struggles of the masses and experiencing their thoughts and feelings, while also gradually changing their own thoughts and feelings. This kind of tempering is of great significance for a realist artist; it is a prerequisite for truly reflecting the life and thoughts and feelings of the masses.

In the past five years, under the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," various forms of fine arts have greatly developed. As long as it is loved by the people and can express new things, whether it is folk or classical, whether it is inherent to China or introduced from abroad, or even newly created forms, all are utilized and given full opportunities for development.

Sculpture, an art form that was extremely underdeveloped in old China, now has a new situation. A large number of buildings and monuments need sculptors to decorate them, the living environment of the people needs sculptors to beautify it, and countless heroic figures need sculptors to shape them. This has created favorable conditions for the development of sculpture. The sculpture project of the "Monument to the People's Heroes" currently under construction in Beijing has brought together many sculptors from all over the country to work there year-round. Thanks to the efforts of the sculptors, in recent years there have been relatively good works such as Wang Chaowen's "Liu Hulan," Xiao Chuanjiu's "Protecting the Factory," Wang Linyi's bas-relief "Great Unity of the Chinese Nation," Liu Kaiqu's "Bust of Ren Bishi," Lu Hongji's "Head of a Soviet Red Army Soldier," and the "Group Sculpture of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers" created in collaboration by young sculptors Ling Chunde, Fu Tianchou, and Liu Xiaochen.

Oil painting has existed in China for four or fifty years, but because it rarely reflected real life in the past and many oil painters were poisoned by Western formalism, it has never had much influence among the people. The oil painting art of new China has undergone significant changes in both the content it depicts and the techniques it employs, and it has become an art form loved by the masses. Oil painters have created many works depicting major themes based on realistic creation methods, such as Luo Gongliu's "Chairman Mao Giving a Rectification Speech at the Party School in Yan'an," Wang Shikuo's "Peasants Joining the Army," and Mo Pu and Li Zhenjian's "Nanchang Uprising," etc. The most outstanding and original work in oil painting is Dong Xiwen's "Founding Ceremony," which is rich in the characteristics and grandeur of national painting.

Chinese painting, which has long been trapped in imitating the works of the ancients and lacks vitality, has also undergone significant improvements. Many Chinese painters, in order to get rid of this habit of imitation, are working hard to learn modern sketching methods based on the spirit of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new"; some old painters have also changed the painting method of "building cars behind closed doors" and have begun to face life, face real objects, and create paintings based on real observation. Thus, works depicting new figures and new things have increased. These works eloquently refute the conservative view that "Chinese painting is not suitable for expressing modern things." And it has become a good start to inheriting the realistic traditions of our country's classical paintings. In these years, Chinese paintings that have been well received by the masses include: Ye Qianyu's "Nationalities Unity," Jiang Zhaohe's "Writing Letters to Volunteer Army Uncles," Li Xiongcai's "Forest," Hu Ruosi's "Presentation of Horses," Yin Shoushi's "Blizzard," Liang Huangzhou's "When Apple Blossoms Bloom," and other works. The ink wash sketches made by Li Keran, Zhang Ding, and others recently using traditional techniques and scientific processing are also a gratifying achievement since the promotion of Chinese painting reform.

The "National Print Exhibition" recently held in Beijing is a concentrated expression of the new achievements of woodcut art in recent years. The techniques expressed in the woodcut works in this exhibition are more diverse. Some woodcut artists used the form of landscape painting to depict real life, such as Gu Yuan's "Jingjiao Avenue," Yan Han's "Our Blood and Sweat are Flowing Together," Li Hua's "When the Tide Recedes," Zhang Jianwen's "Hometown," Yu Shading's "Forest Protection," and Zeng Jingchu's "Village Entrance," etc., which attract the audience like beautiful lyric poems. Liu Xian and Huang Yongyu's decorative allegorical poem illustrations, as well as Li Pingfan's decorative color woodcuts, are also works with unique charm. The artistry of color woodcuts has been improved. It has overcome the tendency to pursue the complex color effects of oil painting, and it tends to have simple colors and bright tones.

New Year pictures and New Year pictures using the form of calendar posters have gradually replaced the vast market for old New Year pictures that promote feudal superstition. This is a major victory for the popularization of fine arts. Lin Gang's New Year picture "Zhao Guilan at the Meeting of Heroes," published in 1951, not only depicts the characters realistically and vividly, but also has the rigorous, exquisite, and perfect characteristics of our country's classical paintings in terms of expression techniques. The appearance of this work has further improved the artistic level of New Year pictures. Others, such as "Chairman Mao Talking with Peasants" (by Gu Yuan), "The Bride Speaks" (by Yan Han), "Mom Can Go to Production with Peace of Mind" (by Zhang Leping), "He is the Strongest in Labor" (by Shang Husheng), "Good Crops" (by Zhan Jianjun), etc., are also excellent works that are very popular among the masses. Comic strip stories, which have been widely circulated among the people, have now been thoroughly transformed, and a large number of works with new content have been produced. These works have become a popular reading material for publicizing and educating the masses and are most welcomed by the masses. In the comic strip stories, the works with characters that are relatively realistic and vivid, with clear, powerful, and distinctive lines are Liu Jiyu's "Chicken Feather Letter" and "Child Labor" co-authored by Zhou Li and five others.

Caricature art has been tempered into one of the most combative arts in the struggle against the enemies of the Chinese people and has gained a high reputation among the masses. Caricaturists Hua Junwu, Mi Gu, Fang Cheng, Zhong Ling, etc., have deeply exposed the despicable and criminal behavior of American aggressors, traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and instigators of new wars in their works. The collection of caricatures "Piercing the Paper Tiger," published in 1950, which exposed the outwardly strong but inwardly weak essence of American aggressors, and the "Selected Political Caricatures of Hua Junwu," published in 1954, are both important gains in caricature art in recent years. Political propaganda posters are a form of art that has only begun to be widely used since the founding of new China. This art form has developed rapidly because it reflects the current peace movement, democratic reform movement, and production reform movement in a timely manner. In the past five years, more than 11 million copies have been disseminated to the people in Beijing alone, powerfully encouraging the masses to fight for peace, labor, and the creation of freedom and happiness.

Shao Yu's series of paintings "Sketches of the Capital," which is highly sensitive to new things, played a good leading role in the development of the art form of life sketching. Life sketching has been very successful in recent years. The Korean battlefield sketches by artists Gu Yuan, Luo Gongliu, Shao Yu, Xiye, Xin Mang, and Chen Xinghua are obvious examples. Although these works depict some fragments of battlefield life, they also show the heroes' perseverance, courage, and optimistic spirit.

The production of arts and crafts with a long history and excellent traditions was never valued before liberation and was in a state of self-sufficiency, but since the Ministry of Culture held the National Folk Arts and Crafts Exhibition in 1953, the situation has changed greatly. Thanks to the government's active investment and support for the production of arts and crafts, the change in the organizational form of individual production in many industries, the establishment of production cooperatives, and the guidance of arts and crafts artists such as Shen Fuwen, Gao Zhuang, Zhu Danian, and Chang Shana, the original extremely declining porcelain, lacquerware, embroidery, wood carving, ivory carving, cloisonné and other craft productions have begun to recover and develop, and have been improved, producing many new styles of crafts. These crafts vividly demonstrate the high creativity and high artistic skills of folk artists.

Another important aspect of fine arts activities - the amateur fine arts activities of the masses - have been vigorously developed under the leadership of trade unions and the guidance of artists. Art groups have been established in large-scale factories and mines, with as many as hundreds of people. Workers' amateur art activities have emerged as a means of self-education for workers, which has promoted workers' creative interest. For example, the Beijing People's Printing Factory painted more than 1,000 propaganda paintings and caricatures in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. A number of talented people with artistic talent have emerged from the workers' amateur art activities, and some of these talents have been selected and sent to art schools for special training.

In order to inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of national fine arts and enrich our artistic creation, the Ancient Painting Gallery and the Ceramics Gallery have been established in the Palace Museum in recent years; the National Fine Arts Research Institute has been established; artists have been organized to investigate ancient art in places such as Bingling Temple and Maijishan; exhibitions of replicas of murals from the Dunhuang Grottoes, the National Folk Arts and Crafts Exhibition, the National Chinese Painting Exhibition, and the Qi Baishi Painting Exhibition have been held; Various anthologies of national fine arts works have been compiled and printed, etc. These works have played a good role in carrying out the study and research of national fine arts and the creation of national styles in fine arts.

The development of fine arts has been very rapid in the past five years. But we must admit: our new fine arts are still very young, not mature enough in art, and far behind the ever-increasing and improving demands of the broad masses for fine arts. Our parks, squares, railway stations, cultural palaces, state-run hotels and other public places cannot yet become the base of fine arts and culture. There, fine arts decorations are very scarce, or lack valuable fine arts works as decorations, especially in parks and squares, it is rare to see any sculptures. In the market, it is difficult to buy more decent tea sets and more beautiful bed sheets. On the contrary, there are many low-quality fine arts products circulating among the masses, affecting the masses' appreciation taste. These phenomena all show that our fine arts work is not done well enough, and it is still far from the requirements of the masses. Therefore, we must never be satisfied with the status quo. Artists must redouble their efforts, strengthen their political and artistic cultivation, strengthen artistic labor, create more and better fine arts works that are more popular among the masses, and further enhance the spiritual power of fine arts works to inspire the masses to move forward; better decorate the lives of the masses and their social environment, to meet the appreciation requirements of the broad masses for fine arts.

    美术工作的重大发展
    全国人民代表大会代表  中国美术家协会副主席  江丰
    五年以来，我国的美术工作，由于贯彻了毛主席的文艺方针，有了重大的发展。五年来，发表在报刊上的各种美术作品，就有一万五千多件。这些作品反映了我国社会生活各方面的巨大变化。这些作品紧密地配合了人民群众当前的革命斗争，在激发群众的爱国热情、劳动热情和推动社会改革运动等方面，都起了很大的作用。走进农村，就可以看到美丽的新年画，一张或者数张地贴在农家的墙壁上；在城市里，色彩鲜明的政治宣传画，已成为商店橱窗、车间、工人俱乐部中经常的装饰物。无论在文化馆或俱乐部中，无论在战场的坑道里和汽车司机的座位旁边，无论在小学生的书包里……都常常放着连续故事画册。由于美术创作的发展，美术展览会一年比一年多了，仅在北京一地，今年就举行了八个展览会。美术作品的印刷品，数量非常巨大，从一九五○年到一九五四年五年间出版的新年画，为一九一、二八七、○○○份，连续故事画为八九、五五四、○○○册。
    随着美术与人民群众的结合日益密切，美术家的队伍大为扩大了。大多数的美术家，在党提出的美术为人民服务的号召下，批判了资产阶级的轻视政治、轻视群众、脱离生活以及各种形式主义的艺术倾向，认识了美术创作必须从群众的具体生活及其进步要求出发的现实主义的基本原则。美术家们积极地到工厂、农村、部队中去，参加群众的各种斗争，体会群众的思想感情，同时也使自己的思想感情逐渐发生变化。这种锻炼，对一个作为现实主义的美术家来说，意义非常重大，它是真实地反映群众生活及其思想感情的先决条件。
    五年以来，在“百花齐放”的方针下，各种美术形式都有很大的发展。只要为人民所喜爱并能表现新事物的，不论是民间的或是古典的，不论是中国固有的或是外国传入的，以至是新创的形式，都被加以运用，都得到充分发展的机会。
    在旧中国时代极不发达的雕刻艺术，现在也有了新的情况。大量的建筑物和纪念碑需要雕刻家去装饰，人民的生活环境需要雕刻家去美化，无数的英雄人物需要雕刻家去塑造，这给雕刻艺术创造了良好的发展条件。正在北京兴建的“人民英雄纪念碑”的雕刻工程，就集中了全国好多的雕刻家在那里常年工作。由于雕刻家们的努力，近年来产生了如王朝闻的“刘胡兰”、萧传玖的“护厂”、王临乙的浮雕“中华民族大团结”、刘开渠的“任弼时胸像”、卢鸿基的“苏联红军头像”，以及青年雕刻家凌春德、傅天仇、刘小岑合作的“工农兵群像”等等一些比较好的作品。
    油画艺术出现于中国虽有四、五十年的历史，但由于它在过去很少反映现实生活，不少油画家并受了西方形式主义的毒害，在人民群众中一直是没有什么影响的。新中国的油画艺术，无论是描写的内容或者是表现的手法，都有了显著的改变，已成为群众所喜爱的一种艺术形式。油画家们根据现实主义的创作方法，创作了不少描写重大主题的作品。如罗工柳的“毛主席在延安党校发表整风演说”，王式廓的“农民参军”，莫朴、李震坚合作的“南昌起义”等等。油画中最出色的、有独创性的作品，当推董希文的富有民族绘画特点和气魄的“开国大典”。
    长期陷于摹仿古人的作品而缺乏生气的国画艺术，也已有显著的改进。不少国画家为了摆脱这种摹仿的习气，根据“推陈出新”的精神，努力学习现代的写生方法；一些老画家也改变了“闭门造车”的作画方法，开始面向生活、面向实物，从现实的观察出发作画，描写新人物和新事物的作品于是就多起来了。这些作品雄辩地推翻了认为“中国画不宜表现现代事物”的保守观点。并成了继承我国古典绘画的现实主义传统的良好开端。在这些年中，国画得到群众好评的有：叶浅予的“民族大团结”，蒋兆和的“写信给志愿军叔叔”，黎雄才的
  “森林”，胡若思的“献马图”，尹瘦石的“暴风雪”，梁黄胄的“苹果花开的时候”等等作品。最近李可染、张仃等所作的运用传统技法并加以科学的加工的水墨写生画，也是提倡国画改革以来的可喜收获。
    最近在北京举行的“全国版画展览会”，就是木刻艺术近年来新的成就的集中表现。这个展览会上的木刻作品，表现的手法更加多样了。有些木刻家用风景画的形式描写了现实生活，如古元的“京郊大道”，彦涵的“我们的血和汗都是流在一起的”，李桦的“当潮水退了的时候”，张建文的“故乡”，俞沙丁的“护林”，曾景初的“村口”等等各有特色的作品，像美丽的抒情诗那样吸引着观众。刘岘、黄永玉的装饰性的寓言诗插图，以及李平凡的装饰性的套色木刻，也都是别有情趣的作品。套色木刻的艺术性提高了，它克服了追求油画那样复复的色彩效果的倾向，而趋向色彩单纯，色调明快。
    新年画和利用月份牌形式的年画，已经逐渐代替了那些宣传封建迷信的旧年画的广大市场，这是美术普及工作的一个重大胜利。一九五一年出版的林岗的年画“群英会上的赵桂兰”，不仅描写的人物真实生动，在表现手法上，也具有了我国古典绘画那样严谨、精致和完美的特色。这个作品的出现，使新年画的艺术水平得到了进一步的提高。其它如“毛主席和农民谈话”（古元作），“新娘子讲话”（彦涵作），“妈妈安心去生产”（张乐平作），“数他劳动强”（尚沪生作），“好庄稼”（詹建俊作）等等，也都是很受群众欢迎的优秀作品。一直在人民群众中广泛流传的连续故事画，现在已得到了彻底的改造，产生了大批新内容的作品。这些作品，已成了一种向群众进行宣传教育并且最受群众欢迎的通俗读物。在连续故事画中描写的人物比较真实生动、用线比较明确有力而有特色的作品，是刘继卣的“鸡毛信”和周立等五人合作的“童工”。
    讽刺画艺术在与中国人民的敌人作斗争中，已经锻炼成为最富有战斗性的一种艺术，在群众中取得了很高的声誉。讽刺画家华君武、米谷以及方成、钟灵等，在自己的作品中深刻揭露了美国侵略者、卖国贼蒋介石、新战争挑拨者的卑鄙的罪恶行为。一九五○年出版的那本戳穿美国侵略者外强中干本质的讽刺画集“戳穿纸老虎”和一九五四年出版的“华君武政治讽刺画选集”，都是近年来讽刺画艺术中的重要收获。政治宣传画是新中国成立以后才开始广泛运用的一种艺术形式。这种艺术形式，由于它及时反映了当前的和平运动、民主改革运动和生产改革运动，所以发展很快。五年来仅北京一处即有一千一百多万份印刷品传播到人民群众中去，有力地鼓舞着群众为和平、为劳动、为创造自由和幸福而奋斗。
    对于新鲜事物富有敏锐感觉的邵宇的组画“首都速写”，在开展生活素描这一艺术形式上曾起了良好的带头作用。近年来生活素描是很有成绩的，美术家古元、罗工柳、邵宇、西野、辛莽、陈兴华等的朝鲜战场素描，就是明显的例子。这些作品虽是描写了战场生活的一些片断，但也表现出了英雄们的坚毅勇敢和乐观主义的精神品质。
    有着悠久历史和优良传统的工艺美术品的生产，解放前，向来是不被人重视而处于自生自灭的状态中，但自从文化部在一九五三年举办了全国民间美术工艺品展览会之后，情况就大有改变。由于政府对工艺美术品的生产积极投资和扶植，由于不少行业改变了个体生产的组织形式，成立了生产合作社，由于得到了工艺美术家如沈福文、高庄、祝大年、常沙娜等的指导，原来已极度衰落了的瓷器、漆器、刺绣、木雕、牙刻、景泰蓝等等工艺生产，都开始恢复和发展起来，并且有了改进，制作了不少新样式的工艺品。从这些工艺品中，鲜明地表现了民间艺术家们的高度的创造性和高度的艺术技巧。
    在美术活动中另一个重要的方面——群众的业余美术活动，由于得到工会的领导和美术家的辅导，蓬勃开展起来了。规模较大的厂矿，都成立了美术组，人数有多至百余人以上的。工人的业余美术活动，是作为工人们自我教育的一种手段而出现的，这样就促进了工人们的创作兴趣。如北京人民印刷厂在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，就画了一千多张宣传画和讽刺画。工人在业余美术活动中涌现出不少富有艺术天资的人材，这些人材，有的已选送到美术学校中去加以专门培养。
    为了继承和发扬民族美术的优良传统，以丰富我们的艺术创造，近年来在故宫博物院内成立了古代绘画馆，陶瓷馆；成立了民族美术研究所；组织了美术家考察了炳灵寺、麦积山等地的古代艺术；举办了敦煌石窟壁画临摹品展览会、全国民间美术工艺品展览会、全国国画展览会、齐白石绘画展览会；编印了各种民族美术的作品选集等等。这些工作，对开展民族美术的学习和研究，对美术上的民族风格的创造，都起了良好的作用。
    五年来，美术的发展是非常快的。但我们必须承认：我们的新的美术还很年轻，在艺术上还不够成熟，还大大落后于广大人民对美术日益增长和日益提高的要求。我们的公园、广场、火车站、文化宫、国家饭店等公共场所，还不能成为美术文化的基地。在那里，美术的装饰非常贫乏，或者是缺乏有价值的美术作品作为装饰，尤其在公园里和广场上，简直很少看到有什么雕刻像。在市场上，很难买得到比较像样的茶具和比较美观的床单。相反的，还有不少质量低劣的美术品却在群众中流传着，影响着群众的欣赏趣味。这些现象，都说明了我们的美术工作做得还很不够，离开群众的要求还远得很。因此我们决不能满足于现状。美术家们必须加倍努力，加强政治的和艺术的修养，加强艺术的劳动，创作更多更好更为群众喜爱的美术作品，进一步地提高美术作品鼓舞群众前进的精神力量；更好地把群众的生活及其社会环境装饰得美丽一些，以满足广大人民对美术的欣赏要求。
