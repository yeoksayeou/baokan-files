The first 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator trial-produced by the state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant was completed ahead of schedule on September 26th.

This generator has seven main components, one of which, the "rotor," is 4.8 meters long and weighs more than five tons. The entire machine has more than 6,000 parts, and the requirements for material usage and parts processing are very strict. Its successful manufacture marks a further improvement in China's electrical manufacturing level. After China decided to manufacture a 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator in 1952, the Czechoslovak Republic supplied a large number of drawings and materials and sent experts to China to provide specific guidance. The Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries selflessly supplied various precision machine tools. The workers in charge of the trial production in the plant specifically set up study classes before the trial production to learn about the trial production work and made samples of the main components for operational exercises. During the trial production process, they also received strong assistance from fraternal factories in Shanghai. More than ten units, including the China Textile Machinery Plant, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant, and the Hudong Shipyard, successively manufactured special equipment and supplied many important materials for the needs of manufacturing the 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator. The Shanghai Electric Power Company also sent experienced veteran workers with rich experience in repairing large steam turbine generators to the plant to help with the manufacturing. The workers in charge of the manufacture of this generator launched a labor emulation campaign from August onwards to welcome the National Day and the convening of the National People's Congress, and finally overcame numerous difficulties and successfully completed the processing and general assembly tasks more than a month ahead of schedule (originally scheduled for completion at the end of October).

    第一台六千瓩汽轮发电机试制成功
    国营上海电机厂试制的我国第一台六千瓩汽轮发电机，已于九月二十六日提前完成。
    这部发电机的主要部件有七个，其中一个“转子”就有四点八公尺长，计五吨多重；全部零件共有六千多个，无论材料使用，零件加工，要求都很严格，它的制造成功标志着我国电器制造水平的进一步提高。一九五二年，我国决定制造六千瓩汽轮发电机以后，捷克斯洛伐克共和国就供给了大批图纸和资料，并派遣专家到我国来给以具体指导。苏联和其他人民民主国家无私的供应了各种精密机床。该厂负责试制的职工们在试制前，曾专门成立了学习班，进行了试制工作的学习，并把其中的主要部件先做成样品，进行操作演习。在试制过程中，并得到上海各兄弟厂有力协助，中国纺织机器厂，上海汽轮机厂，沪东造船厂等十余单位，都曾为制造六千瓩汽轮发电机的需要，先后制造了特种设备，和供给很多重要材料。上海电力公司并派出具有丰富的修理大型汽轮发电机经验的老工人到该厂帮助制造。负责这部发电机制造的职工们为了迎接国庆节和全国人民代表大会会议的召开，自八月份起开展了劳动竞赛，终于克服了重重困难，胜利地提前一个多月（原定十月底完成）完成了加工和总装配任务。
