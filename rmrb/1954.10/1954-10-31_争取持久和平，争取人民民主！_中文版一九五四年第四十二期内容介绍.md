    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
    Introduction to the Contents of the Chinese Edition, 1954, No. 42
    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 42, 1954, has been published.
    The central content of this issue is the outcome of the Sino-Soviet talks. This issue dedicates extensive coverage to the Sino-Soviet joint communiqué and the seven related documents. It also includes the letter from the Soviet government delegation regarding the Soviet people's donation of machinery and equipment to the Chinese people for organizing large-scale state-owned grain farms, and Chairman Mao Zedong's letter of thanks; the letter from the Soviet government delegation to Chairman Mao regarding the Soviet government's donation of machine tools and agricultural machinery exhibited in the Soviet Exhibition Hall to China, and Chairman Mao's reply; and Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the reception held by Soviet Ambassador to China, Yudin, for the Soviet government delegation.
    This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Great Vitality of Sino-Soviet Friendship," commenting on the great significance of the Sino-Soviet talks. The editorial points out: The outcome of the talks held between China and the Soviet Union in Beijing is a new and immeasurable contribution to peace and security in the Far East and the world. The entire great democratic camp and peace advocates worldwide welcome the communiqué of the talks with great satisfaction and excitement. The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union have confirmed that their views are in complete agreement on the comprehensive cooperation increasingly developing between the two countries and on various issues of the international situation. The documents resulting from the talks are permeated with the idea of friendship between the peoples of all countries, with the common ideals of striving for socialism and communism, and with the common goal of striving to defend world peace. This commonality of ideals and unity of goals greatly accelerates the speed of progress of the two countries and exerts an increasing influence on the entire development of human history. The editorial emphasizes: These documents are a new milestone in consolidating the friendship between these two great nations. The whole world can see from the example of the Sino-Soviet talks how close, truly fraternal, and unbreakable friendly relations have been established between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and what bright prospects the new type of international relations established between the countries of the democratic camp opens up for mankind. For the peoples of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all countries of the socialist camp, the banner of peace and friendship is sacred. This banner is invincible!
    Important articles published in this issue include: "Some Achievements of the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of Indonesia" by D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, and "What the Annual Congress of the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party Congress Showed" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain.
    Aidit's article summarizes the main achievements of the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of Indonesia and introduces the resolutions adopted by the congress. The article emphasizes: The Fifth Party Congress, its resolutions, and the events after the congress show that since the founding of the party in 1920, the party's leading bodies and the masses of party members have never been as united as they are now. Moreover, this unity is strengthening day by day in terms of organization, politics, and ideology. And the party's unity has expanded the party's influence among the broad masses, promoted the party's further development, and strengthened our people's struggle for national independence and peace. The resolutions of the Party Congress have greatly promoted the development of our party and the entire revolutionary movement in the country.
    Pollitt's article analyzes the situation of the recently held annual congress of the British Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party Congress, discusses the stronger opposition of the delegates than in previous years to the foreign and domestic policies of the right-wing leading bodies, and the difficult situation of the right-wing leaders, and points out the general mood in Britain reflected in the two congresses, which called for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments, as well as the important significance of the two congresses. The article says: There is no doubt that the annual congress of the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party Congress both reflect the rising sentiment of British workers striving for peace and social progress. The real lesson that can be learned from these two congresses is that the right-wing leading forces have become weaker and weaker, while the left-wing forces have become stronger and stronger. What is most needed now is to unite all left-wing forces, and the most important thing is that the Communist Party and the left wing of the Labour Party must be able to take concerted action.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五四年第四十二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第四十二期中文版已经出版。
    本期的中心内容是中苏会谈的结果。本期以大量篇幅刊载了中苏会谈公报和有关的七个文件，并刊载了苏联政府代表团关于苏联人民赠送机器和设备给中国人民以组织大型国营谷物农场的来函和毛泽东主席的谢函，苏联政府代表团关于苏联政府将苏联展览馆内展览的机床和农业机器赠送给中国事致毛主席的来函和毛主席的复函，以及周恩来总理在苏联驻中国大使尤金为苏联政府代表团举行的招待会上的讲话。
    本期发表了题为“中苏友谊的伟大生命力”的社论，评述中苏会谈的伟大意义。社论指出：中苏两国在北京举行会谈的结果，对于远东以及世界的和平和安全是一个无可估量的新的贡献。整个伟大的民主阵营以及全世界的和平拥护者都以十分满意和兴奋的心情欢迎会谈的公报。中华人民共和国政府和苏联政府确认，在两国间日益发展的全面合作方面和对于国际形势的各项问题上，两国的观点是完全一致的。会谈结果的文件贯串着各国人民友好的思想，贯串着为社会主义和共产主义而奋斗的共同理想以及为保卫世界和平而奋斗的共同目标。这种理想的共同性和目标的一致性大大地加快了两国前进的速度，而且对人类历史的整个发展起着越来越大的影响。社论着重说：这些文件是巩固这两个伟大国家间的友谊的一个新的里程碑。全世界都可以从中国和苏联会谈的事例看出，中苏两国人民建立了怎样密切的、真正兄弟般的、牢不可破的友好关系，民主阵营各国间建立的新型的国际关系为人类开辟了怎样光明的远景。对于苏联、中华人民共和国以及整个社会主义阵营的各国人民来说，和平和友谊的旗帜是神圣的。这面旗帜是不可战胜的！
    本期刊载的重要文章有：印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会总书记德·纳·艾地的“印度尼西亚共产党第五次代表大会的一些成绩”，英国共产党总书记波立特的“职工大会年会和工党年会表明了什么”。
    艾地的文章综述了印度尼西亚共产党第五次代表大会的主要成就，并介绍了大会所通过的各项决议。文章强调说：第五次党代表大会、它的决议以及代表大会以后的事件表明，自从一九二○年建党以来，党的领导机构和党员群众之间从来没有像现在这样团结。而且这种团结在组织上、政治上和思想上都一天天地加强。而党的团结又扩大了党在广大群众中的影响，促进了党的进一步发展，加强了我国人民争取民族独立与和平的斗争。党代表大会的各项决议已大大地促进了我们党和国内整个革命运动的发展。
    波立特的文章分析了最近举行的英国职工大会年会和工党年会的情况，谈到了代表们比往年更加强烈反对右翼领导机构的外交和国内政策的情形，以及右翼领袖们的困难处境，指出了两个年会上所反映的英国普遍要求禁止原子武器和裁减军备的情绪，以及两个年会的重要意义。文章说：毫无疑问，职工大会年会和工党年会都反映了英国工人争取和平和社会进步的日益高涨的情绪。从这两个年会所能获得的真正教训是：右翼领导力量已越来越削弱，而左翼力量则越来越强大。目前所最需要的是团结一切左翼力量，最要紧的是必须使共产党和工党的左翼能够采取一致行动。　（新华社）
