Road Construction Workers on the Kangzang Highway are Breaking Through the Last Major Mountain
Domestically Made Pile Drivers and Drilling Rigs Begin Use on the Kangzang Highway Construction Site

    The eastern section of the Kangzang Highway project reached Sejila Mountain on October 13th. Sejila Mountain is located between Dongjiu in Bomi District and Zumuzong in Gongbu District, with an elevation of more than 4,400 meters. The western section of the project has been built to 72 kilometers east of Taizhao. As of now, only 127 kilometers of the Kangzang Highway remain to be built, and the entire line will be open to traffic in mid-December.

    The road construction workers on the eastern section of the Kangzang Highway are determined to break through the last major mountain leading to Lhasa – Sejila Mountain – ahead of schedule. Encouraged by the slogan "Guarantee the highway will be built to Lhasa this year," the road construction soldiers and workers are striving to complete this project before the heavy snow closes the mountain. Carrying tools, tents, and food, they are opening roads and advancing in the primeval forest area that no one has ever walked through before, rushing to the construction site and starting the project five days ahead of schedule.

    The road construction project on Sejila Mountain is mostly earthwork. Based on past construction experience, the road construction soldiers and workers used rattan, branches, bamboo, and other materials to make a large number of earth-moving tools. The lever earth-moving method was adopted during construction, increasing work efficiency by more than 60% above the standard.

    Before entering the high-mountain construction site, the road construction personnel prepared cold-proof cotton and leather clothing, built moisture-proof high beds, and set up rain shelters and warm rooms with stoves at each construction site. The catering staff also improved the cooking methods to ensure that the construction personnel could eat hot tea and hot meals.

    Two domestically made pile drivers and drilling rigs were recently transported to the Kangzang Plateau to support the construction of the Kangzang Highway. The pile driver delivered this time is the latest diesel pile driver produced in Shandong Province, and the drilling rig is made in Taiyuan. When these machines were transported to the construction site, the road construction workers were as happy as welcoming relatives. These machines have been tested for pile driving and underwater drilling in a key bridge project, and the results are good.

    Before this, all the bridge projects on the Kangzang Highway used manual pile driving. A pile hammer weighing more than 1,000 kilograms could only be dropped once every three minutes. The newly delivered pile hammer weighs 1,200 kilograms and automatically hits 50 to 60 times per minute. In the past, the geological conditions of the riverbed could only be judged based on experience. Now, with the drilling rig, it is possible to determine the geological conditions 50 meters deep under the river, which will guarantee the quality of the bridge project.

    More than 20 workers who escorted the machines have learned the skills to operate these two machines in Chongqing. They are teaching the technology to more workers to welcome the arrival of the second batch of machines. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 康藏公路筑路人员正在打通最后一座大山  我国自制的打桩机和钻探机开始在康藏公路工地上使用

    康藏公路筑路人员正在打通最后一座大山
    我国自制的打桩机和钻探机开始在康藏公路工地上使用
    康藏公路东段工程已在十月十三日修到色齐拉山，色齐拉山位于波密区的东九和工布区的足木宗间，拔海四千四百多公尺。西段工程已修到太昭以东七十二公里。至此，康藏公路仅余一百二十七公里还在修筑，全线将在十二月中旬通车。
    康藏公路东段的筑路人员决心提前打通通向拉萨的最后一座大山——色齐拉山。筑路的战士和工人们在“保证今年把公路修到拉萨”的口号鼓舞下，正争取在大雪封山以前完成这一工程。他们背着工具、帐篷和粮食，在从来没有人走过的原始森林区开路前进，赶到工地，把原定开工的时间提前了五天。
    色齐拉山上的筑路工程大都是土方，筑路战士和工人根据以往施工经验，用藤条、树枝和竹子等制作了大量的排土工具。施工中采用了杠杆排土法，使工作效率超过标准工作效率的百分之六十多。
    筑路人员在进入高山施工前，都准备了防寒的棉衣和皮衣，搭设了防潮的高床，各个工地上都搭起防雨篷和放置火炉的暖室。炊事人员也改进了煮饭方法，保证施工人员能吃到热茶热饭。

    我国自制的打桩机和钻探机各一部，最近运到康藏高原上，支援康藏公路修筑工程。这次运来的打桩机是山东省最新出品的柴油打桩机，钻探机是太原制造的。当这些机器运到工地时，筑路工人像迎亲人一样的高兴。这些机器在某重点桥梁工程施工中作了打桩和水下钻探试验，效果良好。
    在这以前，康藏公路的桥梁工程全是用人力打桩，一千公斤以上的桩锤要三分钟才能落锤一次，新运到的桩锤重一千二百公斤，每分钟自动打五十到六十下。过去对河底地质情况只能凭经验判断，现在有了钻探机，可以判明河底下五十公尺深处的地质情况，将使桥梁的工程质量得到保证。
    护送机器前来的二十多名工人，已在重庆学会了操纵这两种机器的技能，他们正在把技术教给更多的工人，以迎接第二批机器的到来。（新华社）
