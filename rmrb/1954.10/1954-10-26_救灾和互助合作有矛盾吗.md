    Is there a Conflict Between Disaster Relief and Mutual Aid Cooperation?
    Cao Yunsheng
    Only by centering on mutual aid and cooperation can all rural work be done well; production and disaster relief work is no exception. The facts of production and disaster relief work in Poyang County, Jiangxi Province recently fully prove this point.
    Poyang County, on the east bank of Poyang Lake, suffered a severe flood this year. Flooded fields accounted for 40 percent of the total area, and the early rice harvest failed, causing some unrest among the masses. After the disaster, some rich peasants took the opportunity to become active, luring backward middle peasants to hire short-term laborers at low prices. Some middle peasants who had joined mutual aid teams were afraid that poor households would borrow money and grain from them, and seeing many disaster victims working as short-term laborers, they thought it would be more cost-effective to hire short-term labor during busy seasons. Therefore, they were the first to want to break up the teams and work independently. Some middle peasants said, "Now even the clay idol has fallen into the water and can hardly save itself, so it's better to work alone."
    Initially, some cadres relaxed their leadership over mutual aid and cooperative organizations in disaster relief. They believed that there was a conflict between disaster relief and leading mutual aid and cooperation. Some said, "Disaster relief work is so urgent, how can we manage so much? Let's reorganize after the disaster!" Others said, "It's easy to lead the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement in normal times, but after such a big disaster, people will want to seek refuge with relatives and friends. How can we still engage in mutual aid and cooperation?" After the farmers in Siwei Township, Fourth District, suffered from the disaster, the cadres focused solely on disaster relief, without relying on mutual aid and cooperation. As a result, the mutual aid teams all broke up, and the members went to seek refuge with relatives and friends. Some wandered around to escape the famine, while those without labor waited for relief at home, causing great difficulties for disaster relief work.
    Under these circumstances, the CCP Poyang County Committee put forward the slogan of "Carrying out production and disaster relief work centering on mutual aid and cooperation," and educated cadres to understand the relationship between production and disaster relief and mutual aid and cooperation. After the cadres' thinking was clarified, they first combined the work of purchasing and supplying to help agricultural production cooperatives and key mutual aid teams formulate specific plans for production and self-salvation. Under the leadership of the cooperatives and key teams, a county-wide movement of increasing production and practicing economy for production and disaster relief was launched through the mutual aid and cooperation network. In addition to organizing agricultural production such as replanting, supplementary planting, and land reclamation, sideline production such as fishing, collecting shellfish, pushing kiln firewood, burning charcoal, burning lime, burning bricks and tiles, hammering red stone, building boats, weaving bamboo hats, and weaving fishing nets was also carried out. The income from these sideline productions reached 4.18 billion yuan, and fishing alone brought in 1.2055 billion yuan. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams demonstrated the superiority of being organized in production. For example, the Duan Moyang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Fifteenth District promptly organized and allocated labor, sending more than 30 people to reclaim wasteland 20 li away, and 10 people to fish, averaging about 150 jin of fresh fish per day. They have now reclaimed more than 60 mu of wasteland, all planted with millet, sesame, and sweet potatoes, and borrowed 66 mu of leisure land from farmers in mountain villages to plant buckwheat. They ensured that someone was taking care of things at home, someone was engaged in production outside, and both agriculture and sideline production could be taken care of, driving the mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the whole township. Not only did the mutual aid teams in this township not break up, some even requested to transfer to cooperatives. The Wu Chongguang mutual aid team in Shengli Township broke up after the disaster. When replanting late autumn crops after the water receded, everyone did their own thing, unable to take care of everything, and had no choice but to reorganize.
    Aiming at the particularly volatile thinking of middle peasants, they focused on educating the middle peasants, using examples to illustrate that consolidating mutual aid and cooperative organizations in times of difficulty also benefited the middle peasants; and they earnestly implemented mutually beneficial policies to strengthen the unity between poor and middle peasants. At the same time, attention was paid to restricting the activities of rich peasants who took advantage of people's difficulties to engage in speculation and exploitation, so that the middle peasants could get rid of the influence of the rich peasants. Soon, many farmers realized from practice the benefits of organizing to overcome the famine. They generally reflected, "The more there is a disaster, the more we need mutual aid, the more we need to organize."
    These examples educated more and more farmers, and further consolidated and strengthened the mutual aid and cooperative organizations in production and disaster relief. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in the county has now increased from 61 before the disaster to 136, and the number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives has increased from 1.3 percent of the total number of farmers in the past to 3.59 percent. There are 644 mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives, and many seasonal mutual aid teams have been converted into year-round mutual aid teams.

### 救灾和互助合作有矛盾吗

    救灾和互助合作有矛盾吗
    曹云升
    只有以互助合作为中心，才能做好一切农村工作；生产救灾工作也不能例外。江西省鄱阳县最近的生产救灾工作的事实，充分证明了这一点。
    鄱阳湖东岸的鄱阳县今年遭受了严重水灾，被淹田亩占总面积百分之四十，早稻无收，群众情绪有些动荡。在受灾以后，有些富农乘机活动，拉拢落后中农，低价雇短工。有些参加了互助组的中农怕困难户向他们借钱借粮，又看到许多灾民做短工，认为忙时雇短工比较合算，因此首先愿意散伙单干。有的中农说：“现在泥菩萨跌下水，自身都难保，还是单干吧。”
    最初，有些干部在救灾中放松了对互助合作组织的领导。他们认为救灾和领导互助合作有矛盾。有的说：“救灾工作这样紧，那能管得许多，等救灾以后再整顿吧！”有的说：“平常领导农业生产互助合作运动容易，受了这样大的灾，人家都要投亲靠友，还能搞互助合作？”四区四维乡农民受灾后，干部单纯救灾，不依靠互助合作。结果，互助组都散了伙，组员各投亲友，有的四散逃荒，无劳力的在家等救济，给救灾工作造成很大困难。
    在这种情况下，中共鄱阳县委提出了“以互助合作为中心开展生产救灾工作”的口号，教育干部认识生产救灾与互助合作的关系。干部思想明确后，首先结合收购和供应工作，帮助农业生产合作社和重点互助组制订具体的生产自救计划。在社和重点组的带动下，通过互助合作网，开展了全县范围的增产节约生产救灾运动。除组织了抢种、补种、开荒等农业生产外，还进行了捕鱼、捞蚌、推窑柴、烧木炭、烧石灰、烧砖瓦、打红石、架船、编斗笠、织鱼网等副业生产。这些副业生产的收入达四十一亿八千多万元，单捕鱼一项就收入十二亿零五十五万元。农业生产合作社和互助组在生产中显示了组织起来的优越性。如十五区段谟扬农业生产合作社，及时组织调配了劳动力，抽三十多人到二十里外的地方开荒，十个人捕鱼，每天平均捕鲜鱼一百五十斤左右，现已开荒六十多亩，都种上了大粟、芝麻和红薯，又借山乡农民休闲田种荞麦六十六亩。他们做到了家里有人照顾，外面有人生产，农副业都能兼顾，带动了全乡的互助合作组织。这个乡的互助组不仅没有散伙，有些还要求转社。胜利乡吴崇光互助组受灾以后散了伙，在水退后抢种晚秋作物时，大家各干各的，顾了这顾不了那，没有办法，又组织了起来。
      针对着中农思想特别动荡的特点，他们着重对中农进行了教育，用实例说明，在患难中，巩固互助合作组织对中农也有好处；并且切实贯彻互利政策，加强贫农和中农的团结。同时，注意了对富农乘人之危进行投机剥削的活动加以限制，使中农摆脱富农的影响。很快地，许多农民从实际中认识到组织起来生产度荒的好处。他们普遍反映：“越是有灾荒越要互助，越要组织起来。”
    这些实例教育了越来越多的农民，在生产救灾中进一步巩固、壮大了互助合作组织。全县的农业生产合作社现在已由受灾前的六十一个发展到一百三十六个，参加农业生产合作社的农户过去占总农户的百分之一点三，现已发展到百分之三点五九。准备建社的互助组有六百四十四个，还有不少季节性的互助组转为常年互助组。
