    Harbin Electricity Meter Instrument Factory's Construction Projects Completed This Year
    The construction projects of the Harbin Electricity Meter Instrument Factory, which is under construction, were all completed on October 15th this year.
    Only six months ago, this place was still a square, but now No. 3 Workshop, No. 1 Workshop, the boiler room, garage, and flammable goods storage have become connected. In order to start construction as soon as possible, the people building the electricity meter instrument factory promoted the Soviet electrothermal thawing method and dug out the foundation pits for the factory buildings in the frozen ground several feet deep. During the construction process, the workers promoted advanced experiences such as sectional parallel assembly line operations, foundation mortar stone masonry method, and electrothermal concrete drying method, which accelerated the progress of the project and overfulfilled the work plan every month. After completing No. 3 Workshop one month ahead of schedule at the end of August, in order to offer a gift to the National Day and the National People's Congress, they victoriously completed No. 1 Workshop forty-five days ahead of schedule on October 15th.
    Now, a scene of completion is emerging here, with workers dismantling the scaffolding from the completed factory buildings. A temporary boiler room for indoor installation during the winter has been built and will begin supplying gas on October 20th. Workers from the installation engineering team have already entered the site and are preparing to install the external cable project of the factory building before the ground freezes. (Li Ye)

    哈尔滨电表仪器厂今年建筑工程全部竣工
    正在兴建的哈尔滨电表仪器厂，今年的建筑工程已于十月十五日全部竣工。
    早在六个月前，这里还是一片广场，现在这里第三号厂房和第一号厂房、锅炉房、汽车库、易燃品库已经连成了一片。建设电表仪器厂的人们为了早日开工，推行苏联电热化冻法，在结冻数尺深的地下挖出了厂房基础坑。在施工过程中，工人们推行了分段平行流水作业法、座浆砌石法和电热混凝土干燥法等先进经验，加速了工程进度，月月均超额完成了作业计划。他们在八月末提前一个月建成三号厂房之后，为了给国庆节和全国人民代表大会会议献礼，又提前四十五天于十月十五日胜利地完成了第一号厂房。
    现在，这里已呈现着一片收工景象，工人们从竣工的厂房拆下了脚手杆子；为冬季进行室内安装的临时锅炉房已经建成，将于十月二十日开始送气。安装工程队的工人们已经进入现场，他们准备在上冻前安装好厂房外部的电缆工程。（李晔）
