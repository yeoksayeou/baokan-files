Questioning the Editors of "Literary Gazette"
　　Yuan Shuipai
　　The Chinese Writers Association recently held a meeting to discuss the issue of "Dream of the Red Chamber" research (see news in this newspaper on October 26). The meeting reflected that the literary and art circles have begun to recognize the seriousness of this issue. However, this phenomenon has only recently emerged. For a long time, our literary and art circles have shown a tolerant and numb attitude towards Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism, allowing it to occupy the dominant position in the field of classical literature research without giving it the slightest impact; and when people outside the literary and art circles took the lead in launching an attack and proposing criticism, some people in the literary and art circles came out to express compromise towards the bourgeois ideology of "authoritative scholars" and adopted a lordly attitude towards the vibrant Marxist ideology. Can this be tolerated?

　　The editor's note added by "Literary Gazette" when reprinting Li Xifan and Lan Ling's "On 'A Brief Discussion of Dream of the Red Chamber' and Others" revealed this attitude. The note said:

　　"This article was originally published in the ninth issue of 'Wen Shi Zhe' monthly magazine published by Shandong University this year. Its authors are two young people who are beginning to study Chinese classical literature; they tried to criticize Mr. Yu Pingbo's arguments in the article 'A Brief Discussion of Dream of the Red Chamber' from a scientific point of view. We think this is worth attracting everyone's attention. Therefore, with the consent of the authors, we reprinted it here, hoping to arouse everyone's discussion so that we can have a deeper and more correct understanding of this great masterpiece 'Dream of the Red Chamber.'

　　During the reprint, the authors corrected some typos, and the editor changed one or two words, but the author's original opinions were completely preserved. The author's opinions obviously have some shortcomings and are not comprehensive enough, but their understanding of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' is basically correct. Only by continuing to study in depth can we make our understanding deeper and more comprehensive, and our understanding more comprehensive; and not only about 'Dream of the Red Chamber' but also about all our excellent classical literary works."

　　The editor added a note, probably to draw readers' attention to this discussion. But what's strange is that the editor said so much but didn't mention the essence of this discussion, namely, opposing the idealist viewpoint in the study of Chinese classical literature, opposing the literary and art circles' tolerance, obedience, and even praise and eulogy for this idealist viewpoint.

　　Do we have reason to say that the literary and art circles originally had a tolerant, obedient, and even praising and eulogizing attitude towards idealism in classical literature research?

　　"Literary Gazette" is a specific example. The ninth issue of "Literary Gazette" published on May 15, 1953, had a review recommending Yu Pingbo's "Dream of the Red Chamber Research" to readers. It said: "The predecessor of this book was 'Dream of the Red Chamber Debate,' which was published thirty years ago. The author revised and supplemented it based on newly discovered materials over the past thirty years and renamed it the current title for republication. ... All past redologists wore tinted glasses and made many interpretations, all of which were far-fetched and unsubstantiated. The book 'Dream of the Red Chamber Research' has done meticulous textual research and collation, sweeping away all the dreamlike nonsense of past 'redology.' This is a great achievement. There are also many other valuable textual researches and studies."

　　As pointed out in Li Xifan and Lan Ling's "Review of 'Dream of the Red Chamber Research'," the book "Dream of the Red Chamber Research" does have its correct and useful parts, but the fundamental ideology, the author Yu Pingbo's erroneous literary ideology, was not pointed out at all in this review in "Literary Gazette." Is this not tolerance and obedience?

　　Wen Huaisha's postscript attached to the main text of "Dream of the Red Chamber Research" praised the book and satirized revolutionary literature and art since the May Fourth Movement. "Literary Gazette"'s review ignored this and repeatedly praised the book. The postscript believed that the author had "achieved considerable good results," and "Literary Gazette" further described it as a "great achievement." Is this not praise and eulogy?

　　Since the past reviews were like that, it's no wonder the current note is like this.

　　But what makes this note particularly strange is its bourgeois aristocratic lordly attitude towards young authors.

　　We have reason to demand that the editors of "Literary Gazette" treat the articles it publishes fairly. However, if we look at the nineteen issues of "Literary Gazette" that have already been published this year, among the no fewer than five hundred articles published, the editors only added notes to thirteen articles, and in these thirteen notes, twelve of them only contain words of support or praise; only when reprinting the article written by Li Xifan and Lan Ling did the editor hurry to tell readers that "the author's opinions obviously have some shortcomings and are not comprehensive enough." As for what the shortcomings are, the editor didn't point them out but simply stated that they "obviously" exist.

　　The unfair treatment – what is the reason? Perhaps the note has already made it clear to us: "The authors are two young people who are beginning to study Chinese classical literature," and although they wrote an article that is "basically correct," it can only be regarded as "trying to use scientific viewpoints" and so on. It is worth noting that when "Guangming Daily"'s "Literary Heritage" supplement published Li and Lan's "Review of 'Dream of the Red Chamber Research'" on October 10, it also added a similar note. That "Editor's Note" said: "Currently, the extremely important task of how to use Marxist scientific viewpoints to study classical literature has not been carried out well and urgently needs to be developed. This article attempts to raise some questions and opinions in this regard and can be used as a reference for us. At the same time, we hope that this will arouse everyone's attention and discussion." Look at it: "Literary Gazette" and "Literary Heritage" do not state that any other authors' articles are written by "young people" who are "beginning to study...", who are "trying to" "raise some questions and opinions," and do not state that they are only "for our reference." Only these two articles are treated so specially. What is the motivation behind this? Could it be that all the other authors of "Literary Gazette" and "Literary Heritage" are old people who have fully studied Chinese classical literature? Could it be that all the other articles they publish are not "attempts" or "for our reference" but are all final judgments that cannot be discussed?

　　For celebrities and old people, no matter whether they are promoting bourgeois ideas or not, they are all nodded to and considered "undoubted"; for unknown people and young people, because they promote Marxism, the editors will generally treat them coldly, demand comprehensiveness, and minimize their value as much as possible. We can only say that this "is basically" a bourgeois aristocratic lordly attitude.

　　This lordly attitude is not the first time it has been manifested in the "Literary Gazette" editorial department. Not long ago, the vast readers warmly welcomed a new writer, Li Zhun, who wrote a novel, "Cannot Take That Road," and its adapted drama, which played a positive role in the publicity of the country's general line in various places. However, "Literary Gazette" immediately criticized this work with a basically negative attitude and opposed the support of this new writer by the newspapers and periodicals that recommended this novel, causing dissatisfaction among the literary and art circles and the masses. Although "Literary Gazette" later published an article correcting its own mistakes and admitted that it should "give due warm welcome and support to new authors who are emerging one after another, especially new authors who have been in the actual life of the masses for a relatively long time, are quite familiar with the life of the masses, and can raise new problems in life," and regarded this incident as "a good lesson"; however, not long after saying these words, "Literary Gazette" once again showed an attitude of definitely not "warm welcome and support" to Li Xifan and Lan Ling, "new authors" who "can raise new problems." Here, "Literary Gazette" is closely connected with bourgeois idealism and bourgeois celebrities but is very distant from Marxism and the new forces that promote Marxism. Isn't this obvious?

　　It should be pointed out that this is by no means just a problem with "Literary Gazette." Many newspapers, periodicals, and institutions have the erroneous style of liking "big names," ignoring "small people," not relying on the masses, and looking down on new forces. The cultural and artistic circles do not provide enough cultivation and encouragement to new writers, and a few publications and critics seem to be untouchable "authorities" who cannot be criticized and seem to be "correct" forever, while many correct and fresh ideas and forces are blocked and suppressed in various ways and cannot emerge. If they do emerge, they will inevitably be beaten down and subjected to the picky, lordly attitude of being insufficiently this or insufficiently that.

　　The corrupt concepts of bourgeois "fame and position," "statusism," "authority worship," and "showing off seniority" are at play here.

　　Their task seems not to be how to do everything possible to attract new forces to strengthen and renew their ranks but to lie across the road and block the advance of new forces.

　　Many people in the literary and art circles have read Stalin's letter to Comrade Felix Kohn. In the letter, Stalin said: "I have no regrets that I wrote a preface to a trivial pamphlet by an unknown person in the literary world... I strongly object to writing prefaces only for pamphlets and books by literary 'dignitaries,' literary 'celebrities,' 'masters,' and so on. I think that we should now abandon that aristocratic habit of promoting literary 'dignitaries' who have already been promoted. Because of the 'greatness' of these 'dignitaries,' our young, unknown, and forgotten literary forces are constantly groaning."

　　The letter also said: "Our country has hundreds and thousands of capable young people who are doing their best to rush from the bottom to the top in order to contribute their bit to the overall treasure of our construction work. However, their efforts are always in vain because they are often suppressed by the arrogance of literary 'celebrities,' the bureaucracy and ruthlessness of some of our institutions, and the envy of their peers (which has not yet turned into competition). One of our tasks is to break down this copper wall and iron wall and give an outlet to countless young forces."

　　Let us learn from this in practice, not just in words!

### 质问“文艺报”编者

    质问“文艺报”编者
    袁水拍
    中国作家协会最近开了一个会，讨论关于“红楼梦”研究的问题（见十月二十六日本报新闻）。会议反映出，文艺界已经开始认识到这个问题的严重性。但这种现象还是最近才出现的。长时期以来，我们的文艺界对胡适派资产阶级唯心论曾经表现了容忍麻痹的态度，任其占据古典文学研究领域的统治地位而没有给以些微冲撞；而当着文艺界以外的人首先发难，提出批驳以后，文艺界中就有人出来对于“权威学者”的资产阶级思想表示委曲求全、对于生气勃勃的马克思主义思想摆出老爷态度。难道这是可以容忍的吗？
    “文艺报”在转载李希凡、蓝翎“关于‘红楼梦简论’及其他”一文时所加的编者按语，就流露了这种态度。按语说：
    “这篇文章原来发表在山东大学出版的‘文史哲’月刊今年第九期上面。它的作者是两个在开始研究中国古典文学的青年；他们试着从科学的观点对俞平伯先生在‘红楼梦简论’一文中的论点提出了批评，我们觉得这是值得引起大家注意的。因此，征得作者的同意，把它转载在这里，希望引起大家讨论，使我们对‘红楼梦’这部伟大杰作有更深刻和更正确的了解。
    在转载时，曾由作者改正了一些错字和由编者改动了一二字句，但完全保存作者原来的意见。作者的意见显然还有不够周密和不够全面的地方，但他们这样地去认识‘红楼梦’，在基本上是正确的。只有大家来继续深入地研究，才能使我们的了解更深刻和周密，认识也更全面；而且不仅关于‘红楼梦’，同时也关于我国一切优秀的古典文学作品。”
    编者加了按语，大概是为了引起读者对于这个讨论的注意。但是可怪的是编者说了这样一大堆话，却没有提到这个讨论的实质，即反对中国古典文学研究中的唯心论观点，反对文艺界对于这种唯心论观点的容忍依从甚至赞扬歌颂。
    我们有没有理由说文艺界原来存在着对古典文学研究中的唯心论具有容忍依从甚至赞扬歌颂的态度呢？
    “文艺报”就是一个具体例证。一九五三年五月十五日出版的“文艺报”第九号有一则向读者推荐俞平伯著“红楼梦研究”的评介文字。其中说：“这本书的前身是三十年前曾出版过的‘红楼梦辨’，著者根据三十年来新发现的材料重新订正补充，改成现在的书名，重新出版。……过去所有红学家都戴了有色眼镜，做了许多索隐，全是牵强附会，捕风捉影。‘红楼梦研究’一书做了细密的考证、校勘，扫除了过去‘红学’的一切梦呓，这是很大的功绩。其他有价值的考证和研究也还有不少。”
      “红楼梦研究”一书固如李希凡、蓝翎“评‘红楼梦研究’”一文中所指出，也有它的正确的和有用的部分，可是它的根本的思想，作者俞平伯的错误的文艺思想，却一点也没有在“文艺报”的这篇评介中被指出。这不是容忍依从吗？
    附在“红楼梦研究”本文后面文怀沙的跋文对这本书备加赞扬，并捎带一枪，针对“五四”以来革命文艺讥诮了一通，“文艺报”的这篇评介对这也不加理会，却一再地称赞这本书。跋文认为作者已“获得相当良好的成绩”，“文艺报”更进一步说成是“很大的功绩”。这不是赞扬歌颂吗？
    既然过去的评介曾经是那样，就难怪现在的按语是这样的了。
    但是这个按语尤其可怪的是它对待青年作者的资产阶级贵族老爷式态度。
    我们有理由向“文艺报”的编者要求公平地待遇它所刊登的文章。然而，我们就以今年已经出版的十九期“文艺报”来看，其中发表的大小文章不下五百篇，编者加了按语的只有十三篇，在这十三条按语中，有十二条都只有支持或称赞的话；独独在转载李希凡、蓝翎两人所写的这一篇文章的时候，编者却赶紧向读者表明“作者的意见显然还有不够周密和不够全面的地方”。至于究竟有哪些缺点，编者并没有指出，不过是“显然”存在罢了。
    待遇不公平，是什么缘故呢？也许按语中已经给我们点明：“作者是两个在开始研究中国古典文学的青年”，他们虽则写了“在基本上是正确的”文章，也只能算是“试着从科学的观点”云云而已。值得注意的是十月十日“光明日报”“文学遗产”副刊登载李、蓝两人“评‘红楼梦研究’”一文时也加了类似的按语，那一个“编者按”说：“目前，如何运用马克思主义科学观点去研究古典文学，这一极其重要的工作尚没有很好的进行，而且也急待展开。本文在试图从这方面提出一些问题和意见，是可供我们参考的。同时我们更希望能因此引起大家的注意和讨论。”请看吧：“文艺报”和“文学遗产”对于任何其他作者的文章都不声明是“开始研究……”的“青年”“试着”“提出一些问题和意见”，都不声明是只“供我们参考的”，惟有对这两篇文章就如此特别对待，这究竟是什么动机呢？难道“文艺报”和“文学遗产”的其他作者一律都是充分研究了中国古典文学的老年吗？难道它们所发表的其他文章一律都不是“试图”或“供我们参考”，而一律都是不能讨论的末日的判决吗？
    对名人、老人，不管他宣扬的是不是资产阶级的东西，一概加以点头，并认为“应毋庸疑”；对无名的人、青年，因为他们宣扬了马克思主义，于是编者就要一概加以冷淡，要求全面，将其价值尽量贬低。我们只能说，这“在基本上”是一种资产阶级贵族老爷式的态度。
    这种老爷态度在“文艺报”编辑部并不是第一次表现。在不久以前，全国广大读者群众热烈欢迎一个新作家李准写的一篇小说“不能走那一条路”及其改编而成的戏剧，对各地展开的国家总路线的宣传起了积极作用，可是“文艺报”却对这个作品立即加以基本上否定的批评，并反对推荐这篇小说的报刊对这个新作家的支持，引起文艺界和群众的不满。“文艺报”虽则后来登出了纠正自己错误的文章，并承认应该“对于正在陆续出现的新作者，尤其是比较长期地在群众的实际生活中、相当熟悉群众生活并能提出生活中的新问题的新作者，……给以应有的热烈的欢迎和支持”，而且把这件事当作“一个很好的教训”；可是说这些话以后没有多久，“文艺报”对于“能提出新问题”的“新作者”李希凡、蓝翎，又一次地表示了决不是“热烈的欢迎和支持”的态度。“文艺报”在这里跟资产阶级唯心论和资产阶级名人有密切联系，跟马克思主义和宣扬马克思主义的新生力量却疏远得很，这难道不是显然的吗？
    应该指出，这决不单是“文艺报”的问题，许多报刊、机关有喜欢“大名气”、忽视“小人物”、不依靠群众、看轻新生力量的错误作风。文化界、文艺界对新作家的培养、鼓励不够，少数刊物和批评家，好像是碰不得的“权威”，不能被批评，好像他们永远是“正确”的，而许多正确的新鲜的思想、力量，则受到各种各样的阻拦和压制，冒不出头；万一冒出头来，也必挨打，受到这个不够那个不够的老爷式的挑剔。
    资产阶级的“名位观念”、“身份主义”、“权威迷信”、“卖老资格”等等腐朽观念在这里作怪。
    他们的任务似乎不是怎样千方百计地吸引新的力量来壮大、更新自己的队伍，反而是横躺在路上，挡住新生力量的前进。
    文艺界的很多人曾经读过斯大林的给费里克斯·康同志的信，斯大林在信中这样说：“我毫不后悔我给文学界一个无名的人的不足道的小册子写了一篇序言，……我坚决反对只给文学‘显贵’、文学‘名人’、‘巨匠’等等的小册子和书写序言。我认为，我们现在应当抛弃那种对本来已经提拔起来了的文学‘显贵’再加以提拔的贵族习惯，由于这些‘显贵’的‘伟大’，我们的年轻的、没没无闻的和被大家所忘记的文学力量正处于不断呻吟之中。”
    这封信又说：“我国有成百成千有能力的青年人，他们用尽全力要从下面冲到上面来，以便向我们建设工作的总的宝藏贡献自己的一点儿东西。然而他们的努力总是白费，因为他们常常被文学‘名人’的自傲、我们某些机关的官僚主义和冷酷无情、同辈男女的羡妒心（它还没有转变成竞赛）压下去了。我们的任务之一就在于打破这堵铜墙铁壁，给不可胜数的年轻力量以出路。”
    让我们在实际上，而不是在口头上，从这里吸取教训吧！
