Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: Hong Kong dispatch: The Japanese Diet Members Delegation, passing through Hong Kong on the 24th on their way back home, told reporters that they were deeply impressed by China's peaceful policies and the Chinese people's friendship towards the Japanese people.

Suzuki Mosaburo, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation from the Japan Socialist Party (Left Wing), said: "Some of us did not understand the new China before. After this visit, we all understand. Our entire delegation unanimously believes that relations between China and Japan should be normalized." He said: "We all feel that the Chinese people sincerely desire peace." Suzuki pointed out that "the problem of failing to improve Sino-Japanese relations lies with Japan, not with China." He believes that "the first step to improve (Sino-Japanese) relations should be to improve and develop Sino-Japanese trade relations." He also said that the Japanese Diet Members Delegation believes that trade relations between Japan and China must be restored.

Suzuki Mosaburo said that at present, Asian countries are extremely uneasy about developments in Japan. He said that the two factors causing anxiety are: Japan's being controlled by the United States and the revival of Japanese militarism.

Suzuki said that some people believe that if Japan gets rid of the protection of the United States, then China will attack Japan. He pointed out that there is absolutely no such possibility, because he knows for sure that China sincerely hopes to establish relations with Japan under the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Sugiyama Motojiro, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation from the Japan Socialist Party (Right Wing), said that the improvement of the Chinese people's living standards has strengthened their desire for peace.

Yamaguchi Kikuichiro, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation from the Liberal Party, also believes that the relations between China and Japan should be improved. He said: "The Chinese people do not hate the Japanese people because Japan once invaded China. The Chinese people welcome the establishment of normal friendly relations with Japan." He also stated that now is the time for the Liberal Party's foreign policy to adapt to the trend of the times.

Tokuji Tokonami, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation from the Progressive Party, said: Construction is proceeding solidly in China. The fact that China is becoming increasingly powerful is a fact that cannot be ignored. He pointed out that China is now in an era of construction and has no intention of invading Japan at all, and that it is willing to be friendly with Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 26th: According to reports in Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" on the 25th, Yoshishige Abe, head of the Japanese Academic and Cultural Delegation to China and President of Gakushuin University, made observations to the Hong Kong press on the 24th regarding his visit to China.

Abe Yoshishige said: "It is very clear that China is moving forward." The main gain of the Japanese Academic and Cultural Delegation's visit to China this time was to help promote cultural exchanges between China and Japan. He said that he had seen China, free from foreign aggression, developing its culture with great confidence. He also said: "Chinese students are studying very optimistically and diligently under the protection of the government."

Takeshiro Kuraishi, a member of the Japanese Academic and Cultural Delegation to China and a professor at the University of Tokyo, also told reporters: "The lives of the Chinese people are beautiful." He said that he saw how Chinese university students were not at all worried about life and were able to concentrate on their studies. He said excitedly: "The Japanese people should have a happy and beautiful life like the Chinese people, and Japanese students should have a learning environment like Chinese students." Takeshiro Kuraishi said: "As a scholar, I hope that there will be no more wars in this world."

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 26th: The seven-member Pakistani Women's Delegation, led by Mrs. Shah Nawaz, which was invited by the All-China Women's Federation to participate in the National Day celebrations in our country, arrived in Guangzhou on the 24th via Shanghai and left Guangzhou for home via Hong Kong on the 25th.

Mrs. Shah Nawaz, head of the delegation, delivered a radio speech on her visit to China at the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station. The speech mentioned how Chinese women serve their country wholeheartedly, morning and night, and also mentioned how women in the new China have achieved equal status with men. Then she said: "The young generation, male and female, are full of enthusiasm for their work and talk about how much they can contribute to the development of their country."

"Wherever we went, people talked only of peace and the progress of mankind, and of what we women could do to maintain peace. One obvious purpose of theirs at the moment seems to be to strive for the full development of their own country in all aspects and for world peace and prosperity. Almost every aspect of development in China has had a good and organized right start."

She concluded: "We thank the All-China Women's Federation for their warm invitation, which has given us the opportunity to meet women of many different nationalities. Such exchanges of views and personal contact help to promote mutual understanding, cooperation and goodwill."

    日本两个访华代表团的成员发表访问观感
    巴基斯坦妇女代表团团长离我国前发表广播演说
    【新华社二十六日讯】香港消息：日本国会议员访华团一行二十四日路经香港返国时，对记者发表谈话，一致表示对中国的和平政策和中国人民对日本人民的友好有深刻的印象。
    日本国会议员访华团日本社会党（左派）团长铃木茂三郎说：“我们当中有些人以前对新中国是不了解的。经过这次访问以后，我们都明了了。我们全团一致认为，中日两国关系应该恢复正常。”他说：“我们都感觉，中国人民是真诚要求和平的。”铃木指出，“中日关系目前还未能改善，问题是在日本方面，而不在中国方面。”他认为，“（中日）两国关系的改善，第一步应该是改善和发展中日的贸易关系。”他并说，日本国会议员访华团认为必须恢复日本和中国之间的贸易关系。
    铃木茂三郎说，目前，亚洲国家对日本国内的发展极为不安。他说，引起不安的两个因素是：日本受美国的控制和日本军国主义的复活。
    铃木说，有些人认为，如果日本摆脱美国的保护，那么中国就会进攻日本。他指出，根本没有这种可能，因为他确知中国诚心诚意地希望在和平共处的五项原则下和日本建立关系。
    日本国会议员访华团日本社会党（右派）团长杉山元治郎说，中国人民生活水平的提高已加强了和平的愿望。
    日本国会议员访华团自由党团长山口喜久一郎也认为中日两国的关系是应该改善的。他说：“中国人民并没有因为日本曾经侵略中国而仇视日本人民，中国人民欢迎和日本建立正常的友好关系”。他并表示：现在是自由党的外交政策应该适应时潮的时候了。
    日本国会议员访华团改进党团长床次德二说：在中国，建设事业是在坚实地进行着。中国日益强大是事实，这是不能忽视的。他指出，中国现在是处在建设时代，根本没有侵略日本的意思，它表示愿意和日本友好。
   【新华社广州二十六日电】据香港“大公报”、“文汇报”二十五日报道，日本学术文化访华代表团团长、日本学习院大学校长安倍能成二十四日对香港报界发表了访问中国的观感。
    安倍能成说：“很明显地，中国正在向前迈进”。日本学术文化访华代表团此次访问中国的主要收获是帮助促进中、日两国的文化交流。他表示已经看到排除了外国侵略势力的中国，正在很有信心地把文化发展起来。他并说：“中国的学生们正在政府的保护之下，非常乐观地努力学习。”
    日本学术文化访华代表团团员、东京大学教授仓石武四郎也对记者说：“中国人民的生活是美好的。”他说他看到了中国大学生完全不为生活操心，能够专心读书的情形。他激动地说：“日本人民应该像中国人民那样有幸福美好的生活，日本学生应该有像中国学生那样的学习环境。”仓石武四郎说：“作为一个学者，我愿望这个世界上再也没有战争。”
    【新华社广州二十六日电】应中华全国民主妇女联合会的邀请前来我国参加国庆观礼的巴基斯坦妇女代表团一行七人，在团长沙阿·纳瓦兹夫人率领下，于二十四日经上海到达广州，二十五日离广州经香港回国。
    代表团团长沙阿·纳瓦兹夫人曾在上海市人民广播电台发表访华广播演说。演说中说到了中国妇女朝朝暮暮全心全意为祖国服务的情形，也说到了新中国妇女已取得和男子平等地位的情形。接着她说：“男的和女的年轻一代对他们的工作都充满着热情，并谈论着他们在他们祖国的发展中能作出多大贡献。”
      “不论我们走到哪里，人们谈论的只是和平和人类的进步，以及我们妇女能做些什么来维护和平。她们目前的一个明显的目的看来是要为在各方面充分发展她们自己的国家和为全世界的和平和繁荣而努力。差不多在中国的各方面的发展，都有了良好的和有组织的正确的开端。”
    她最后说：“我们感谢中华全国民主妇女联合会的热情的邀请，这使我们有机会和许多不同民族的妇女见面。这样的意见交换和私人接触帮助促进了相互的了解、合作和善意。”
