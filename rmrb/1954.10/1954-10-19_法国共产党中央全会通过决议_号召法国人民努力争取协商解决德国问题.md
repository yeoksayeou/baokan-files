Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 17th Dispatch from TASS—The plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, which began on October 15th, has concluded. After discussing issues such as opposing the revival of German militarism and defending peace, the meeting passed a resolution calling on the French people to continue their struggle to defeat new conspiracies to revive German militarism and to strive for consultations among major powers to peacefully resolve the German question.

　　French Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau member, Laurent Casanova, first delivered a report at the meeting.

　　Casanova said that in the current international situation, despite the rejection of the "European Army," German militarism may still be revived. The French government's policy on the German question is to agree to arm West Germany, make West Germany join the North Atlantic Alliance, and refuse to resume four-power talks on resolving the German question.

　　Casanova demanded that the French government take necessary measures to hold talks on the peaceful resolution of the German question. He said that national interests require France to take its own measures to restore international negotiations. The first measure should be to refuse to arm West Germany in any way.

　　Casanova mentioned Molotov's recent proposal to hold four-power talks to withdraw occupying forces from Germany and hold free elections in Germany, believing that negotiations could begin immediately and that some issues could be satisfactorily resolved, thereby providing possibilities for resolving other issues.

　　Casanova concluded by discussing the French Communist Party's attitude in the struggle against arming West Germany. He said that the Party resolutely reiterated its determination to fight together with all social groups and political organizations that oppose the revival of German militarism, and with all representatives of these organizations, regardless of their status and political affiliation, both nationally and in parliament.

　　The plenary session discussed Casanova's report.

  　French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez gave a brief speech at the plenary session. Thorez emphasized the significance of the Indochina ceasefire and the rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty for French political life. He went on to say that the new conspiracy to revive the German Wehrmacht—the London Agreement—can be defeated. Thorez called for strengthening the struggle to win united action by the French working people.

　　Finally, the plenary session passed a resolution. The resolution emphasized that although the Indochina armistice and the rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty were major victories in the struggle for peace and French national independence, "it is necessary to remain vigilant in order to smash new anti-peace conspiracies. On the one hand, under pressure from the United States, the French government signed the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization treaty. This treaty runs counter to peaceful cooperation with Asia, and the provisions concerning Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam are a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords. On the other hand, in the face of the French people's firm opposition to the 'European Defense Community,' those who advocate arming German revanchists have adopted new conspiracies in order to forcibly implement this armament in another form."

　　The resolution said: "The French government has rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to hold negotiations, and at the London Conference, it agreed to decide to arm Bonn Germany within the framework of the Brussels Treaty and the Atlantic Treaty. Arming West Germany and dragging West Germany into the Atlantic military bloc are new and dangerous obstacles to the peaceful resolution of the German question, the European question, and the disarmament issue. This will lead to an arms race, exacerbate international tensions, and put the world in danger of suffering an atomic war."

　　The resolution said: "The French people should continue their struggle to eliminate the fatal danger brought to France by the revival of German militarism. The National Assembly's vote in favor of the principles of the London Agreement is a very serious danger. However, this issue has not yet been resolved, and the parliament will soon express its position on the ratification of the London Agreement. Since the resistance of the French people led to the rejection of the Bonn and Paris treaties, the London resolutions can and must be defeated."

　　The resolution pointed out: For the security of France, it is necessary to make the method of peaceful resolution through consultation prevail, that is, France, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States should consult and peacefully resolve the German question; that is, to establish a collective security system in which all European countries can participate; that is, the Soviet Union has once again proposed universally and supervised disarmament in the United Nations.

    法国共产党中央全会通过决议
    号召法国人民努力争取协商解决德国问题
      【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会在十月十五日开始举行的全体会议已经结束。这次会议在讨论反对复活德国军国主义及保卫和平等问题以后通过决议，号召法国人民继续斗争，击败复活德国军国主义的新阴谋，争取实现大国协商，以和平解决德国问题。
    法共中央政治局委员加桑诺瓦首先在会议上作报告。
    加桑诺瓦说：在目前国际形势下，尽管“欧洲军”被拒绝了，德国军国主义仍然可能复活。而法国政府在德国问题上的政策却是：同意武装西德，使西德加入北大西洋联盟，并且拒绝恢复有关四国关于解决德国问题的商谈。
    加桑诺瓦要求法国政府采取必要措施，以便就和平解决德国问题举行会谈。他说：民族利益要求法国自己采取措施来恢复国际谈判。而第一个措施应当是拒绝以任何方式武装西德。
    加桑诺瓦提到了莫洛托夫最近关于举行四大国谈判以便撤退驻德占领军并在德国举行自由选举的建议，认为谈判可以立即开始，而且有可能圆满解决某些问题，从而为解决其他问题提供可能。
    加桑诺瓦最后谈到法国共产党在反对武装西德的斗争中的态度。他说：党坚决重申，它决心在全国和在议会中同一切反对德国军国主义复活的社会团体和政治组织，同这些组织的所有代表，共同斗争，而不论他们的身份和政治派别如何。
    全会讨论了加桑诺瓦的报告。
  　法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士在全会上作了简短的讲话。多列士着重指出印度支那停火和
  “欧洲防务集团”条约的被拒绝对于法国政治生活的意义。他接着说，复活德国国防军的新阴谋——伦敦协议是可以击败的。多列士号召加强争取法国劳动人民一致行动的斗争。
    最后，全会通过了一项决议。决议着重指出，虽然印度支那停战和“欧洲防务集团”条约的被拒绝是争取和平与法国民族独立斗争中的重大胜利，
  “但是，必须保持警惕，以粉碎新的反和平阴谋。一方面，在美国的压力下，法国政府在东南亚公约上签了字。这个公约是与亚洲的和平合作背道而驰的，其中关于老挝、柬埔寨、南越的条文是公然违反日内瓦协定的。另一方面，在法国人民坚决反对‘欧洲防务集团’的情况下，主张武装德国复仇主义分子的人又采取了新的阴谋，以便用另外一种形式来强制推行这种武装。”
    决议说：“法国政府拒绝了苏联关于举行谈判的建议，在伦敦会议上同意决定在布鲁塞尔条约和大西洋公约范围内武装波恩德国。武装西德和把西德拉入大西洋军事集团，是和平解决德国问题、欧洲问题以及裁军问题的新的危险的障碍。这将导致军备竞赛，加剧国际紧张局势，使世界处于遭受原子战争的威胁中。”
    决议说：“法国人民应当继续斗争，消除由于德国军国主义复活而给法国带来的致命的危险。国民议会表决赞同伦敦协议的原则，是一个十分严重的危险。但是，这一个问题还没有解决，议会很快就要就批准伦敦协议的问题表示态度。既然法国人民的反抗使波恩和巴黎条约遭到拒绝，那么伦敦决议也是可以而且一定能够击败的。”
    决议指出：为了法国的安全，必须使协商和平解决的办法占优势，这就是法、苏、英、美进行协商和平解决德国问题；就是建立欧洲所有国家都可以参加的集体安全体系；就是苏联在联合国又一次提出的普遍地、有监督地进行裁军。
