On Several Issues Concerning the Study of China's Chemical History
    Yuan Hanqing

    After shaking off the ideological influence of the semi-colonial era, China's scientific community has an urgent need to understand the history of ancient science in our motherland; this is especially true for teaching work, which requires relevant teaching materials. Chemistry is an important branch of natural science, and chemistry teachers in various schools hope to obtain materials on China's chemical history. The broad masses of cadres and youth also hope to acquire knowledge in this area. Therefore, conducting planned research on the history of Chinese chemistry and gradually compiling reliable historical facts is a work that meets everyone's needs.

    In the past, our research on the scientific history of our motherland was very limited. Although some preliminary compilation work had been done, most of it only involved superficial discussions, with very little in-depth and concrete summarization. In recent years, several Chinese chemists and historians have begun to collect and compile chemical historical materials. Therefore, discussing issues related to the study of China's chemical history will help to promote future research.

    Regarding the study of China's chemical history, at least the following aspects need to be discussed:

    Some Principles of Studying Chemical History

    Studying chemical history, like studying the history of other sciences or any branch of cultural history, must have a correct historical perspective. In other words, the argumentation and evaluation of every fact in chemical history must be studied in conjunction with the social conditions of the time. Otherwise, it will not only be of little significance, but will also lead to errors.

    Chemistry has developed into a vast field of knowledge in natural science today. Its content is very broad, its theory is quite profound, and its methods are extremely meticulous. If we use today's rich chemical knowledge as a yardstick to measure the achievements of the ancients, and thus consider these achievements to be meager and insignificant, and despise them, then it would not conform to the historical perspective. Of course, we cannot compare the smelting level of stainless steel with the ironware of the Warring States period, but the improvement of smelting technology in the Warring States period did improve agricultural production at that time. Only with a correct historical perspective can we patiently carry out the compilation and research of ancient chemical historical materials.

    On the other hand, a correct historical perspective can save us a lot of energy in our research work. For example, some people say that in the Tang Dynasty, alchemists decomposed water into two substances. However, judging from the chemical properties of water, the material conditions of the society at that time made such chemical decomposition impossible. Therefore, we do not need to spend a lot of time searching for historical materials in this area; even if such texts have been preserved, they can only be fantasies and not experimental records. Another example is the wooden ox and flowing horse designed by Zhuge Liang in the third century. At that time, it may have been an advanced means of transportation suitable for the geographical conditions of Sichuan, but the material basis at that time could not have made them have anything in common with today's internal combustion engine vehicles. A correct historical perspective can draw conclusions for us. Therefore, applying a correct historical perspective is an essential basic principle for studying chemical history.

    The study of chemical history must also pay attention to a certain degree of systematicness in the development process of chemical knowledge in China. Some writings on the history of science often emphasize discussing those most exciting creations and inventions, that is, the scientific knowledge and technological achievements first discovered and created by our ancestors. For example, the invention of papermaking and gunpowder is indeed a great contribution of the Chinese people to human culture; in addition, there must be many other creations and inventions worthy of in-depth research or searching. However, on the other hand, there are many scientific knowledge and technological manufacturing that were not first invented by our ancestors, but may have been independently invented by our ancestors, or absorbed foreign technical experience and improved or changed them. In China's long historical process, there must be many types of these parts, and their development must also have an independent system different from other countries. We should also attach importance to the research in this area.

    For example, in terms of the manufacture of porcelain, China created glazed porcelain in the second century AD, more than 1,400 years earlier than Europe, which is a fact that can be proudly claimed. However, those of us who study chemical history cannot simply be satisfied with the early invention era, but also need to conduct in-depth research on the development and gradual improvement of porcelain manufacturing. People who study art history have done a lot of work in this area, but people who study science and technology history have hardly done any. What are the differences in the chemical composition of the raw materials and glazes of porcelain in different dynasties? What improvements have been made to the structure of porcelain kilns? No one has been able to answer these questions so far. This is a very good topic for people who study chemical history.

    Another example is, was glass independently invented by our ancestors, or was it introduced from the West? This is also a question that needs to be deeply researched to be solved correctly. Even if it is said that glass was foreign, we should have improved or changed it after we accepted this technology. Therefore, this still needs to be studied. What is the historical relationship between glass and colored glaze, and what are the similarities and differences in the materials and firing techniques? All of these are worth studying clearly.

    The question of the order of inventions and the question of the process of development should be given equal importance in the history of chemical technology.

    History values truth the most. China's historical materials for thousands of years are very rich in all aspects, which is a field for scientists and historians to cultivate for a long time. On the other hand, the shortcomings are also serious. First, the documents are too scattered, and historical materials can be found in the classics, histories, philosophical works, and literary collections; second, some records are too brief, and isolated words and phrases are not enough to form a strong argument; in addition, the existence of some forged books makes it impossible for researchers of history to be very cautious.

    The conclusions of chemical history must also be very cautious, and attention must be paid to the reliability of historical materials and the authenticity of historical facts. There was once a paper discussing the history of biochemistry, in which the legend that tofu was invented was taken as a historical fact of the early Han Dynasty. Of course, the conclusions drawn were unreliable. Tofu is the processed utilization of plant protein, and this invention is surprisingly creative. In terms of literature, there is no word for tofu or its alias in the writings of the Han Dynasty; Jia Sixie's "Qimin Yaoshu" of the Northern Wei Dynasty, which detailed the processing methods of various agricultural products, did not mention tofu; Tang Dynasty poetry and prose did not mention it either; it was not until the Northern Song Dynasty that texts talked about tofu; it can be seen that the legend that Liu An of the Han Dynasty first created tofu is unbelievable. If you have not read Liu An's works and said "there are records in Huainanzi," then that would be even more wrong.

    Alchemy is the precursor of modern chemistry. Whether in terms of experimental operation technology or the application of drugs, it has done some pioneering work for scientific chemistry. Most of the works on Chinese alchemy are collected in "Daozang," a large series of Taoist books, but many of these books were written by later generations using the names of their predecessors. Attention must be paid when quoting, otherwise reliable conclusions cannot be drawn.

    Those who study chemical history must pay attention to the authenticity of historical materials. We should never bury the achievements of the ancients, and we will never allow the so-called scholars of the foreign bourgeoisie to obliterate China's cultural contributions; but we must also pay attention not to make the conclusions untrue, and it is also inappropriate to exaggerate historical facts in research reports.

    Correct historical perspective, equal emphasis on invention and development, and prudent handling of historical materials are the three principles that people who study chemical history and people who study other scientific histories must follow.

    Several Achievements That Can Be Determined

    Compared with other nations, our ancient ancestors’ inventions, creations, and achievements in chemistry were indeed more than equal. Most of these still require long-term sorting and research to draw conclusions. But at present, there are many inventions and creations that have sufficient arguments, and we should clearly affirm them.

    In terms of chemical technology, papermaking, porcelain, and gunpowder are inventions of our country that have long been praised at home and abroad. The origin of papermaking was about the Western Han Dynasty in the first century BC, and Cai Lun of the Eastern Han Dynasty was the improver of papermaking technology. As for gunpowder, according to reliable documents such as Sun Simiao's writings, it was invented by alchemists in the Tang Dynasty (about the seventh century). The manufacture of porcelain cannot be later than the Eastern Han Dynasty, and both documents and physical objects can be verified. What chemical historians need to continue to study now is the development and improvement of these three technologies in terms of technology.

    Alchemy, which laid the foundation for modern chemistry, has attracted the attention of many foreign researchers of chemical history, and they have published many research papers and works. What is the origin of alchemy? There are various opinions on this question. According to many aspects of research, we can say with certainty that China was the earliest country to have alchemy. At the latest in the early second century BC, many people in China were doing alchemy experiments, and sulfur and mercury were the main raw materials. The records in the "Historical Records" and "Book of Han" and the "Zhouyi Cantongqi" book that has been passed down to this day are reliable evidence. As for Western alchemy, its methods and theories are roughly the same as those in China, but it is hundreds of years later, and there are many signs that Western alchemy was passed down from China. Of course, more concrete evidence can be found to draw an unbreakable conclusion.

    The substitution of metals occupies a very important position in chemical knowledge. The book "Huainan Wanbishu" in the Western Han Dynasty said, "White green gets iron and turns into copper." The book "Shennong Ben Cao Jing" in the Eastern Han Dynasty also mentioned the phenomenon of iron replacing copper. This is a typical example of metal substitution, which later developed into the manufacture of copper sulfate for industrial use in the Song Dynasty. This is another important achievement that should be affirmed in ancient Chinese chemical knowledge.

    Wuzhu coins contain zinc, and the term "Tuoshi" in the fourth-century writings probably refers to zinc-containing brass. Therefore, the question of the origin of zinc has aroused research and discussion among Chinese scholars. Although there is no consistent conclusion on the question of when zinc began to be used, it is basically recognized that at least in the Tang Dynasty, China knew how to use calamine (zinc carbonate) to make brass, and later reached a very high level in the technology of smelting metallic zinc. Song Yingxing's "Tiangong Kaiwu" in the Ming Dynasty has detailed records of smelting Japanese lead (zinc).

    Nickel is not a very common substance in various metals. Europe did not know how to use nickel until the eighteenth century. Chinese white copper contains a certain amount of nickel. The book "Guangya" in the third century explained the word "Wu" as white copper. Chemists have also done some chemical analysis of ancient white copper wares. According to the records of documents and the chemical tests of objects, we can believe that around the Western Han Dynasty, the Chinese people were able to manufacture copper-nickel alloys (white copper), and there were signs of shipping it to Daxia in the Near East. The beginning of the use of nickel is another important achievement of China in chemical technology.

    For thousands of years, the achievements of the Chinese people in chemical knowledge and technology are certainly not limited to the several mentioned above. Other chemical-related knowledge such as paints, dyeing, brewing, leather making, sugar making, metal smelting, medical drugs, etc., are quite rich, but they involve a wide range, which cannot be summarized in a few words, and most of the materials have yet to be carefully sorted out.

      Several Issues to Be Studied

    In the history of Chinese chemistry, there are still some issues that cannot be concluded for a while.

    Some chemistry books published in some countries mention a Chinese book from the Tang Dynasty, saying that there are texts discussing the complexity of air in this book, and there are records of obtaining gas from saltpeter, so it is considered that the person who wrote this book was the first scholar to know oxygen. However, no evidence has been found in China so far. All the words in foreign language books are based on the same source, which is a French paper published in St. Petersburg in the early nineteenth century. The author of this French paper said that he had seen a book (manuscript) of the Tang Dynasty, so he came to this conclusion. It is entirely possible that the alchemists of the Tang Dynasty in China initially recognized the complexity of the air and burned saltpeter, and thus wrote it in the book. However, since there is only a unique French paper available for reference so far, and there is a lack of other evidence and the original Chinese book cannot be found, for the sake of prudence, it can only be regarded as a question to be studied for the time being, and it can only be finally resolved after searching for materials from various aspects.

    "Zhou Li Kao Gong Ji" is the earliest book in China recording ancient technology. What is particularly related to chemistry is the proportion of six kinds of copper-tin alloys, the so-called "Jin You Liu Qi." Many ancient bronzes of copper-tin alloys have been left to this day, and some have been chemically analyzed by chemists. Most of the analysis data are inconsistent with the proportions recorded in "Kao Gong Ji." Is the proportion number in "Kao Gong Ji" just arbitrarily written by the person who wrote the book, or is there another reason? It is possible that the copper and tin used at that time were not pure enough, so although the numbers in "Kao Gong Ji" were based on the actual records at that time, the data analyzed now cannot match. This can only be regarded as a question to be studied for the time being.

    As far as the chemical analysis of bronzes is concerned, whether the ratio in the literature matches the ratio in the objects or not, one point is beyond doubt, that is, as early as the Yin and Shang dynasties three thousand years ago, the ancient Chinese people had already learned to make bronze alloys with different compositions, and they had also used bronzes with different compositions to adapt to different uses.

    Since the origin of alchemy in China was very early, and there were many people engaged in alchemy experiments in the Tang Dynasty, why did alchemy not develop into modern chemistry in China? This is a complex question involving many aspects. The most fundamental reason is of course due to the limitations of China's social conditions. Because China's society has been stagnant in the feudal production relations for a long time, the development of scientific knowledge and production technology is very slow, and alchemy of course cannot develop rapidly. At the same time, alchemy in the Song Dynasty changed from experimental technology of external alchemy to internal alchemy emphasizing breathing and health preservation, and fewer people were engaged in experiments, which may also be one of the reasons for hindering its improvement. On the other hand, the instruments used by Chinese alchemists were made of earth or metal, unlike the glass instruments used by the Arabs later, and the difference in tools would also affect the development of technology.

    What internal and external reasons made alchemy unable to develop into modern chemistry in China, and which reasons are the main ones, should also be regarded as a question to be studied.

    In the history of Chinese chemistry, there were originally many questions that needed to be studied in depth. Why should these three questions be raised separately as questions to be studied? This is because in chemical teaching work, everyone is urgently required to affirm some historical facts, but these three questions, although eager to be resolved, cannot be concluded immediately, so they are specially raised here as questions to be studied.

    Future Research Directions

    The development of chemical knowledge in Chinese history can be roughly divided into two stages: Before the Opium War, Chinese chemical knowledge basically developed independently; after the Opium War, modern chemical knowledge was introduced into China. In the study of ancient chemical history, it can be carried out separately in four parts: chemical knowledge in folk industrial and agricultural production technology, philosophical theory, alchemy, and medicine. In order for this work to be carried out, a group of chemists and historians must be mobilized to cooperate and conduct special studies separately, so that more conclusions can be gradually drawn in a not too long period of time. As for the chemical history of the past 100 years, the historical materials are relatively complete, and the nouns and theories are basically the same as the existing ones, which is easier to summarize.

    In the process of conducting research work, the scope involved is quite wide, and the methods are also diverse. I think at least the following points should be paid attention to:

    First, the investigation of literature must be combined with laboratory work. There are many references related to chemical history, such as many alchemy books in "Daozang," brewing and sugar-making works written by Song Dynasty people, and "Tiangong Kaiwu" of the Ming Dynasty, which are all very valuable materials that need to be carefully sorted out. However, it is not enough to rely solely on written records. On the one hand, some records are too brief to draw conclusions with isolated words and phrases; on the other hand, the names of drugs used in ancient times are different and difficult to completely determine which substances they are equivalent to now. Therefore, after investigating the literature, it is best to use chemical experiments to prove it. As for many folk technologies that have not been recorded in writing, they should be proven by chemical experiments after verification.

    There are two main types of laboratory work related to chemical history: one is to repeat the experiment according to the methods in ancient books; the other is the chemical test of ancient objects. The first type of work can take alchemy as an example. For example, the alchemy methods described in "Baopuzi Nei Pian" may be selected and tried in the laboratory to see what products can be obtained. Of course, there will be difficulties in this. Alchemists often deliberately describe the methods in a very complicated way, and some methods are also hypothetical for them, and the reliability is not great. Therefore, if you do not go through some experiments, you cannot summarize the achievements of alchemists well just by relying on the records in books.

    The chemical testing of ancient objects is an important work. In the past, Chinese chemists only conducted some experiments in the chemical analysis of bronzes. Other objects such as pottery, porcelain, glass, alloys, etc., have hardly been tested at all. This makes it difficult for the research work of chemical history to be in-depth, and archaeologists also lack a scientific basis. For example, whether the glass beads unearthed from the Changsha Chu tomb were made locally or were passed down from foreign countries, this question can be provided some clues and help to solve by relying on chemical test data.

    Second, the investigation and research on the existing technology of folk handicrafts will be of great help to the research work of chemical history. Because China's long-term feudal society has hindered the improvement of production technology, and many of the methods used today are similar to those of hundreds of years ago. For example, the farming methods shown in the Dunhuang Tang Dynasty murals are almost no different from the current agricultural production technology; another example is the brewing method described in the fourth-century book "Qimin Yaoshu," which is still used by the people. From this, it can be seen that if we carefully investigate the details of the existing production technology of the people and compare them with the records in ancient books, we can trace the outline of the evolution of this technology.

    The crafts and technologies of the Chinese people are not the same in all regions. If you only investigate the situation in one place, that is obviously not enough. You must choose several representative areas for investigation in order to obtain reliable materials. Therefore, the investigation work of craft technology is a work with a fairly wide range and a fairly complex nature, and it needs to get close cooperation from industrial chemists.

    Third, ancient science and technology knowledge is not as strictly classified as modern science. A scholar who cares about natural knowledge often has works or contributions in many aspects. For example, Shen Kuo's "Mengxi Bitan" involves astronomy, mathematics, geology, geography, chemistry, mining and metallurgy, etc. We can never just say that Shen Kuo is an astronomer or a chemist, and people who study the history of any department of natural science have the need to refer to "Mengxi Bitan." To be more specific, chemical history and the history of mineralogy and the history of industry are completely inseparable. Therefore, people who study chemical history cannot ignore the history of other scientific departments. Even though the subject of research is only a department in chemical technology, the researcher needs to have broad scientific knowledge and knowledge of ancient books.

    Fourth, in the past, those in capitalist countries who studied the history of science have done some collecting and translating of Chinese chemical historical materials, and have published some papers. They do not have enough understanding of the ancient situation in China, and their views are often incorrect, and the conclusions they draw are generally not very reliable. Even so, some laboratory test results and interpretations of ancient documents and some other opinions still have a certain reference value. In this area, there are more works by Japanese people. We should collect these foreign language works and use them critically.

    The scope involved in chemical history is broad. Generally speaking, the past works mostly stay on the surface of several famous inventions, and there is little historical analysis and a lack of comparison and explanation of modern chemical knowledge. As the initial work, such a situation is naturally inevitable. As for the future work, it must be in-depth and meticulous. In the future, it is necessary to divide chemical history into several topics and conduct research in a planned and divided manner. In the atmosphere where the research work of science history is universally valued, the research work of China's chemical history will be gradually carried out, and there will be exciting gains in the near future.

    Finally, it should be explained that this article is a summary of the opinions of the China Chemical History Symposium held in August this year. This symposium was sponsored by the Chinese Chemical Society, and the research issues of Chinese chemical history were discussed at the meeting.

    关于研究我国化学史的几个问题
    袁翰青
    我国科学界在摆脱了半殖民地的思想影响之后，都有认识祖国古代科学历史的急迫要求；而在教学工作里，尤其需要这方面的教材。化学是自然科学里的一个重要部门，各学校的化学教师都希望能得到我国化学史的材料，广大的干部和青年也希望得到这方面的知识。因此，有计划地进行中国化学史的研究工作，陆续将可靠的史实整理出来，乃是一件适合大家的要求的工作。
    过去，我们对于祖国的科学历史研究得很有限，虽曾有些初步的整理工作，但是大部分只作了些浮泛的论述，很少进行深入的具体的总结。近几年来，我国已有几位化学工作者和历史学工作者在进一步着手搜集和整理化学史料。因此，对于有关研究我国化学史的问题，加以讨论，是有助于今后的研究工作的开展的。
    关于我国化学史的研究，至少有以下几个方面需要讨论：
    研究化学史的一些原则
    研究化学史也和研究别种科学的历史或是文化史里的任何一部门一样，必须具有正确的历史观点。换句话说，对于化学史里的每一事实的论证和评价，必须结合当时的社会条件来研究。否则不但意义不大，而且还会造成错误。
    化学发展到今天已经成为自然科学知识领域里很庞大的一个部门。它的内容十分广博，理论相当高深，方法极度细密。如果我们以今天的丰富的化学知识的尺度，来衡量古人的成就，从而认为这些成就微薄贫乏，加以轻视，那就不合乎历史观点了。我们当然不能以不锈钢的冶炼水平来比较战国时代的铁器，可是战国时代冶炼技术的提高确曾改进了当时的农业生产。我们只有具备了正确的历史观点，才能耐心地进行古代化学史料的整理和研究。
    另一方面，正确的历史观点可以使我们在研究工作中节省许多精力。例如有人说，在唐朝已有炼丹者把水分解成两种物质。可是从水的化学性质来看，当时社会的物质条件是不可能作这样的化学分解的。因此，我们就没有必要花费许多的时间去搜寻这方面的史料；即或有这样的文字保留下来，那也只能是幻想，不会是实验纪录。又如第三世纪时诸葛亮设计的木牛流马，在当时可能是适合四川地理条件的进步的交通工具，但是当时的物质基础决不可能使它们和今天的内燃机动车有任何相同之处，这是正确的历史观点就可以替我们作出结论的。所以运用正确的历史观点乃是研究化学史所决不可少的一项基本原则。
    研究化学史还须重视化学知识在我国发展过程中的一定程度的系统性。有些关于科学史的文字，往往偏重于讨论那些最令人兴奋的创造发明，就是我国古代首先发现的科学知识和所创造的技术成就。例如造纸和火药等等的发明，确实是中国人民对人类文化的伟大贡献；此外值得深入地研究或是搜寻的其它创造发明，也一定不少的。可是另一方面，有好些科学知识和工艺制造虽不是我们祖先首先发明的，但也可能是我们祖先独立发明的，或者是吸收了外来的技术经验加以改进或改变的。这些部分在我国悠久的历史过程中，种类一定很多，它们的发展一定也具有不同于别国的独立系统。我们同样应当重视这一方面的研究。
    例如就磁器的制造来说，在公元二世纪我国就创造了敷釉的磁器，早于欧洲一千四百多年，这是可以自豪的史实。可是我们研究化学史的，不能仅仅满足于发明时代之早，还须深入地研究磁器制造的发展和逐步提高的情形。研究艺术史的人在这方面是做了相当多的工作的，而研究科学技术史的人却几乎没有作。历代磁器的原料和釉彩，在化学成分上有什么不同？磁窑的构造后来有什么改进？至今没有人能回答这些问题。这正是研究化学史的人的很好的题目。
      又例如，玻璃究竟是我们祖先独立发明的，还是从西方传来的？这也是一个有待深入研究才能正确地解决的问题。即或说玻璃是外来的，但是，当我们接受了这种技术以后，应当曾经有过改进或改变。因此，这仍然是需要研究的。玻璃和琉璃的历史关系如何，用料和烧制技术的异同等等，都值得研究清楚。
    发明的时代先后问题和发展的过程问题，在化学技术史里是应当并重而不能偏枯的。
    历史最重真实。我国几千年来的史料，在各方面都很丰富，这乃是可供科学家和历史学家长期耕耘的田地。从另一方面看，缺点也是严重的，首先是文献过于分散，经史子集里无不有史料；其次是有些记载过于简略，孤言片语不足以构成有力的论证；再加以一些伪书的存在，就更使研究历史者不能不十分谨慎了。
    化学史的结论也要十分谨慎，必须注意到史料的可靠性和史实的真实性。曾经有一篇讨论生物化学史的论文，其中关于发明制豆腐的问题，把宋人以后才有的传说当成汉初的史实，所得的结论当然就很不可靠了。豆腐是植物蛋白质的加工利用，这一项发明是富有惊人的创造性的。就文献来说，汉朝人的著作里未见有豆腐或其别名的字样；北魏贾思勰的“齐民要术”里详载各种农产品加工的方法也没有讲豆腐；唐人的诗文里也未见提及；到北宋方有文字谈到豆腐；可见汉朝刘安首创豆腐的传说是难以置信的。如果并未翻阅刘安的著作而说出
  “淮南子里已有记载”的话，那就更不对了。
    炼丹术是近代化学的先驱，无论在实验操作技术方面或药物的应用方面，都替科学的化学做了一些开路工作。我国炼丹术的著作绝大部分都收集在道教的一部大丛书“道藏”里，但其中有许多书是后人冒用前人的姓名写作的，引用时必须注意，否则就得不出可靠的结论。
    研究化学史的人必须注意史料的真实性。我们决不应埋没古人的成就，更不容许外国资产阶级的所谓学者抹煞我国在文化上的贡献；可是我们同样须要注意，决不可使结论失实，而研究报道中夸大史实也是不合适的。
    正确的历史观点，发明和发展并重，史料的审慎处理，乃是研究化学史的人和研究其他科学史的人同样须要遵守的三项原则。
    已经可以确定的几项成就
    我们古代祖先在化学方面的发明创造和成就，比起别的民族来确实有过之无不及。这中间大部分尚须作长期的整理和研究，才能作出结论。但在目前，有许多已经有了足够的论据的发明创造，我们便应当明确地肯定下来。
    在化学工艺方面，造纸、磁器、火药乃是久已传颂中外的我国的发明。造纸的起源约在公元前一世纪的西汉，而东汉的蔡伦是造纸技术的改良者。至于火药，据可靠的文献如孙思邈的著作等证明，是唐朝（约第七世纪）炼丹者发明的。磁器的开始制造不能迟于东汉，文献和实物都可考证。现在化学史工作者所需要继续研究的是这三种工艺后来在技术方面发展和改进的情形。
    为近代化学做了奠基工作的炼丹术曾经引起外国许多研究化学史的人的注意，他们发表过好些研究论文和著作。炼丹术的起源如何？对于这一问题有种种不同的意见。根据许多方面的考证，我们可以肯定地说，世界上之有炼丹术，以我国为最早。至迟在公元前二世纪初期，我国已有许多人做炼丹的实验，并且以硫黄和水银为主要原料。史记和汉书上的记载以及传留至今的周易参同契一书，都是可靠的证明。至于西方的炼丹术在方法和理论方面大体和我国的相同，却要晚几百年，而且有许多迹象可以说明西方的炼丹术是我国传去的，当然还可找到更多的具体证据来做出颠扑不破的结论。
    金属的取代作用，在化学知识里占很重要的地位。我国西汉时的著作“淮南万毕术”里就有“白青得铁即化为铜”的话，东汉时的著作“神农本草经”里也提到铁取代铜这一现象。这是金属取代作用里的一个典型，后来在宋朝曾经发展为制造工业用的胆铜。这是我国古代化学知识里应当肯定的另一项重要成就。
    五铢钱里就含有锌质，第四世纪的著作里的鍮石这一名词大概是指含锌的黄铜。所以关于用锌的起源问题，曾引起我国学者的研究和讨论。虽然在什么时候开始用锌这一问题上还没有得到一致的结论，但基本上都承认，至迟在唐朝，我国就知道用炉甘石（碳酸锌）做黄铜，并且后来在炼金属锌的技术上达到很高的水平。明朝宋应星的“天工开物”一书里，就有炼倭铅（锌）的详细记载。
    镍在各种金属里本不是太普通的物质。欧洲到十八世纪才知道用镍。我国的白铜里是含有一定成分的镍质的。第三世纪的著作“广雅”一书里就把鋈字解释为白铜，化学家也曾作了些古白铜器的化学分析。根据文献的记载和实物的化验，我们都可以相信：大约在西汉时，我国人民已能制造铜镍合金（白铜），并且有运往近东大夏的迹象。镍质的开始利用是我国在化学技术上的另一重要成就。
    数千年来，我国人民在化学知识和技术方面的成就，当然决不仅限于以上所提的几种。其它如油漆、染色、酿造、制革、制糖、冶炼金属、医疗药物等等有关化学的知识都是相当丰富的，不过它们牵涉的范围很广，不是几句话所能概括的，并且绝大多数的资料还有待仔细整理。
      待考的几个问题
    在我国化学史里，还有些一时不能得出结论的问题。
    有些国家出版的化学书里提到我国唐朝的一本著作，说这本著作里有讨论空气复杂性的文字，并且有从硝石得出气体的记载，所以认为写这本著作的人是最早知道氧气的学者。这在我国国内至今却还没有能找到证据。所有外文书里的话都是根据同一个来源，那是十九世纪初年在圣彼得堡发表的一篇法文论文。这篇法文论文的作者说他曾看过一本唐朝的著作（手抄本），所以作出这一结论。我国唐朝的炼丹者初步认识到空气的复杂性，并且烧过硝石，因而写在书里，那全是可能的。可是因为至今只有唯一的法文论文可查考，既缺乏其它证明，又找不到中文原著，为了审慎起见，暂时还只能视为待考的问题，待多方面搜寻资料之后，才好最后解决。
    “周礼考工记”是我国记载古代工艺技术的最早的一部著作。这中间和化学特别有关的是六种铜锡合金的比例，所谓“金有六齐”。铜锡合金的古代青铜器遗留至今的很多，有些曾经化学家作过化学分析。分析的数据绝大部分和“考工记”所记的比例不相符。究竟是“考工记”上的比例数仅系写书的人任意写的，还是另有原因呢？可能由于当时所用的铜和锡都不够纯，所以“考工记”上的数字虽系根据当时的实录，而现在分析的数据却无法吻合了。这也只能暂时作为一个待考的问题。
    就青铜器的化学分析而言，无论文献上的比数和实物上的比数是否相符，有一点是不必置疑的，就是早在三千年前的殷商时代，我国古代人民已会制造成分不同的青铜合金了，并且也已运用不同成分的青铜来适应不同的用途了。
    我国的炼丹术既然起源很早，并且在唐朝有很多的人搞炼丹实验，为什么炼丹术没有在我国发展成近代化学呢？这是一个牵涉到好多方面的复杂的问题。最根本的理由当然是由于我国社会条件的限制。由于我国的社会长期停滞在封建制的生产关系上，科学知识和生产技术的发展很缓慢，炼丹术当然也无法迅速发展。同时，炼丹术到了宋朝就由实验技术的外丹，转向着重呼吸养生的内丹，搞实验的逐渐少了，这也可能是阻滞它提高的原因之一。另一方面，我国炼丹者所用的器具是土质的或是金属的，不像阿拉伯后来用了玻璃器，工具的差别也会影响技术的发展。
    究竟还有哪些内在的和外在的原因，使炼丹术没有能在我国发展成为近代化学，并且哪些原因是主要的，这也应当视为一个待考的问题。
    在我国化学史里，本来有许许多多问题需要展开深入的研究。为什么要单独把这三个问题提出作为待考的问题呢？这是因为在化学教学工作中，大家迫切地要求肯定一些史实，而这三个问题虽急于求得解决，却又无法即行作出结论，所以特别作为待考的问题，在这里提出来。
    今后的研究方向
    化学知识在我国历史上的发展，大体可以划分为两大阶段：鸦片战争以前，我国化学知识基本上是自己独立地发展的；鸦片战争之后，近代化学知识传入我国。在研究古代的化学史方面，可以就民间工农业生产技术、哲学理论、炼丹术以及医药中的化学知识这四部分分别进行。为了这一方面的工作能够开展，必须发动一批化学家和历史学家合作，分头作专题研究，才能在不太久的时期之内，逐步得出更多的结论。至于近百年来的化学史，史料既比较完整，名词和理论基本上又和现有的相同，比较容易总结。
    在进行研究工作之中，牵涉的面是相当广的，方法也是多样的，我认为至少应当注意下列几点：
    第一，文献的查考要能结合实验室的工作。有关化学史的参考文献是不少的，如像“道藏”里许多丹术书，宋朝人写的酿酒制糖等著作，明朝的
  “天工开物”之类，都是很有价值的资料，需要精细地加以整理。不过仅仅凭借文字的记载是不够的，一则有些记载过于简略，不能以孤言片语作结论；二则古代所用药物名称纷歧，难于完全确定其相当于现在的哪些物质，因此，查考了文献之后，最好能用化学实验来证明。至于许多未经文字纪录的民间工艺技术，更应当在考证以后，用化学实验证明。
    有关化学史的实验室工作主要有两类：一类是根据古书里的方法重复做一下实验；另一类是古物的化验。第一类的工作可以拿炼丹为例。譬如“抱朴子内篇”里所叙述的丹法，不妨选择几种，在实验室里试做一下，看看究竟能得到什么产物。这里面当然会遇到困难的，炼丹者往往故意把方法记述得很复杂，而且有些方法在他们也是假想的，可靠性不大。因此，如果不经过一些实验，单凭书本的记载是不能将炼丹者的成就很好地总结起来的。
    古物的化验是一项重要的工作。过去我国的化学工作者只在青铜器的化学分析方面进行过一些实验，其他实物如像陶器、瓷器、玻璃、合金等样品，几乎完全未经化验。这就使得化学史的研究工作不易深入，考古学家也缺少了一部分科学的根据。例如长沙楚墓出土的玻璃珠，究竟是本地制造的还是外国传来的，这一问题，依靠化验数据是可以提供一些线索，帮助解决的。
    第二，民间手工业现有技术的调查研究对化学史的研究工作会有很大的帮助。因为我国长时期的封建社会，阻滞了生产技术的改进，有许多今天应用的方法，和几百年前的方法大同小异。例如敦煌唐代壁画里所表现的耕种法几乎和现在的农业生产技术无大差别；又如第四世纪的著作“齐民要术”里所叙述的酿酒法，至今还在民间应用。由此可见，如果我们仔细地调查民间现有生产技术的详情，拿来和古书的记载对照，是可以追寻出这项技术演变的轮廓的。
    我国民间的工艺技术，在各地不尽相同。如果只调查一个地方的情形，那显然是不够的，必须选择几个有代表性的地区进行调查，才能够得到可靠的材料。因此，工艺技术的调查工作，是范围相当广而性质相当复杂的一件工作，它需要得到工业化学家的密切合作。
    第三，古代的科学技术知识不像近代科学分类十分严谨，一个关心自然知识的读书人往往对于好些方面都有著作或贡献。例如沈括的“梦溪笔谈”一书里涉及到天文、数学、地质、地理、化学、矿冶等等部门，我们决不好仅仅说沈括是一个天文学家或是化学家，而研究自然科学任何一部门历史的人，都有参考“梦溪笔谈”的必要。再具体地说一下，化学史和矿物学史以及工业史等等是完全无法分开的。所以研究化学史的人不能忽视其他科学部门的历史。尽管研究的题材仅仅是化学工艺里的一个部门，而研究者却需要具备广泛的科学知识和古籍的知识。
    第四，过去资本主义国家研究科学史的人，对于我国的化学史料，曾经有人做过一些搜集和翻译的工作，发表过一些论文。他们对我国古代的情形是不够了解的，观点常常是不正确的，他们所作的结论一般是不大可靠的。虽然如此，有些实验室的化验结果和古文献的解释以及其他的某些意见都还有一定的参考价值。在这一方面，日本人的著作较多。我们应当搜集这些外国文的著作，批判地加以利用。
    化学史所涉及的范围是广阔的。一般说来，过去的论著颇多浮面地逗留在几个著名的发明上，而且既少进行历史的分析，又缺乏近代化学知识的比照说明。作为初期的工作自然不免会有这样的情况，至于今后的工作就必须深入而细密了。今后势必要把化学史分成若干专题，有计划地分工进行研究。在科学史的研究工作受到普遍重视的空气中，我国化学史的研究工作是会逐步开展起来的，而在不久的未来，也会有令人兴奋的收获的。
    最后应当说明，这篇文章是综合今年八月中国化学史讨论会上的意见写成的。这次讨论会是由中国化学会主办的，会上曾讨论了中国化学史的研究问题。
