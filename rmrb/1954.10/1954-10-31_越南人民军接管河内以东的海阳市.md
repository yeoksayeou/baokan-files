    Vietnam People's Army Takes Over Hai Duong City East of Hanoi
    Xinhua News Agency: A delegation from the Vietnam People's Army and a delegation from the French Union Forces reached an agreement on October 26 regarding the handover of the Hai Duong area (east of Hanoi). The agreement stipulated that the handover should be carried out in an orderly and safe manner. Neither side should take any hostile actions and should be responsible for preventing any damage to public institutions and property, as well as any infringement on the lives and property of residents. The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army will send an advance team of administrative and security personnel to prepare for the formal handover.
    Hai Duong City is the capital of Hai Duong Province, more than 50 kilometers west of Hanoi and more than 40 kilometers east of Haiphong, with a population of nearly 30,000. For eight years, the people of Hai Duong City and its suburbs have supported the resistance movement. After the ceasefire, especially after the liberation of Hanoi, workers, staff members, and civil servants in Hai Duong City actively protected archives, data, and machinery, preventing certain members of the French side from transporting or destroying them.

    越南人民军接管河内以东的海阳市
    据新华社讯：越南人民军代表团和法兰西联邦部队代表团十月二十六日就海阳地区（河内以东）的移交达成了协议。协议规定：移交工作应该有秩序而安全地进行。双方都不得采取任何敌对行动，并应负责阻止任何破坏公共机关和公共财产以及侵犯居民生命财产的行为。越南人民军总司令部将派行政和治安人员先遣队去准备正式交接事宜。
    按海阳市是海阳省省会，西离河内五十多公里，东到海防四十多公里，居民近三万人。八年来海阳市和郊区的人民一直支持抗战运动。停战以后，特别是河内解放后，海阳市的工人、职员、公务员们积极保护档案、资料和机器，不让法方的某些人员运走或破坏。
    【新华社三十日讯】　据越南通讯社河内讯：越南人民军三十日晨六时三十分接管了海阳市。双方移交行政管理的工作已在二十九日下午五时完毕。在法兰西联邦部队撤退的同时，越南人民军先遣部队即分三路进入海阳。接管工作在三十日上午七时三十分完成。
    海阳的接管工作是在有秩序和安全的情况下进行的。同日下午二时，越南人民在这个新解放的城市举行了正式升旗礼。
    十月二十九日，越南人民军依照双方达成的协议已接管了位于海阳市周围地区第十七号公路上的化乃村、第二十号公路上的计瑟和第五号公路上的锦江村。越南人民军进入这些地方时受到居民的热烈欢迎。
