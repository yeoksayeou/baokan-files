We March Towards a Common Goal
By Vietnamese Poet To Huu

We walk under the sunlight,
We walk briskly on the road,
On the eight-foot wide road.
It’s from Bac Son, from Truong Xa to Thai Nguyen,
It passes through the Northwest,
It ascends to Dien Bien Phu,
It’s the road of revolution,
It grows with the resistance war.
Today the road leading to the ocean is newly built,
Look how red the soil on the road is!

Oh, how beautiful is the Motherland!
There are paper mulberry forests, tea hills,
There are fragrant green fields.
The Lo River reflects the shining sunlight,
The Lo River sings gurgling songs.
On the Binh Ca wharf side, ferryboats bustle about.

	Who passed through Phu Tho,
	Who went to Trung Ha,
	Who went to Hung Hoa,
	Who went to the Tam Lien District,
	Who went to the Tu Lien District.
There, our road freely resounds,
There, the enemy's bunkers are all demolished.
The Thao River stirs up surging waves,
Those from Hanoi, let's disembark here together.
Peace has arrived, the boats hoist their white sails,
Look over there, the Long Châu wharf is just ahead.

Ah, nine years of resistance,
Nine years of resistance, we never rest,
Our legs and knees are still so strong.
Raise our heads high:
The surrounding scenery is so crystal clear.
The August sky is so blue,
Clouds fly freely in that autumn sky.
What a bright and beautiful day it is!
Those are our clouds.
That is our deep sky,
That is our Democratic Republic of Vietnam!

	The enemy's shadows shrink back,
	The August dome of the sky is always so clear.
	On our way back to Hanoi,
	The red flag flutters around President Ho's silver hair!
Mother, wipe away your tears,
The enemy has fled our villages!
The green bamboo in our village is sprouting new shoots,
Our banana plantation presents a fresh green,
Our houses are quickly thatched with palm leaves,
Our fields are more jubilant than they were ten years ago...
Children, have you gone to school yet?
Your older brothers have built a new school for you,
This school, the enemy must not dream of burning down with a fire.
The children's school is over there on Bald Mountain.
The children's clear voices resound throughout the village...

Who went to the South,
Who went to the Tien Giang, Hau Giang,
	Who went to the city named Ho Chi Minh [Note 1],
		Ho Chi Minh’s brilliant name emits golden light.
Who went to visit the vast Dong Thap Muoi.
The soil of North and South Vietnam buries the enemy's corpses.
That land is where we are rooted and grow!
Who went to Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Phu Yen, Binh Dinh, Khanh Hoa,
Who went to Phan Rang, Phan Thiet,
Who went to Tay Nguyen, Kon Tum, Dak Lak,
There is our Interzone V, Interzone V lies long between Central and South Vietnam!

Who has returned to our beloved homeland,
Our homeland, which is the Perfume River, the Ben Hai, the Song Gianh.
To those who go there, tell our compatriots and comrades:
Our country is the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!
We are born of the same father,
Our flesh and blood are connected, our hearts are linked.

No matter who utters sweet words,
Our hearts are still as firm as a three-legged cauldron;
No matter who surrounds us with layers of fences to isolate us,
Our hearts still deeply believe in the people led by President Ho.
We have grown up in the smoke of gunpowder and fire.
French thieves must not dream of blocking the advance of our heroic nation,
That is our workers and peasants advancing under the light of the revolutionary sun.
Our compatriots in Hai Phong, Bac Giang, Lang Son [Note 2] are advancing.

	Ah, the glorious victory of Dien Bien Phu shook the world,
	We stand up,
	Let the feudal system be buried deep in the mud.
		Let us advance, advance on our road,
			Continue advancing on our road.
		We are as strong as steel,
		Our ranks are so vast,
		Our ranks are as stable as high mountains,
		Our ranks are as long as great rivers,
		Our ranks are as magnificent as the East Sea before us!

	Cheer, cheer our brothers –
	Cheer Issarak, [Note 3]
	Cheer Issarak! [Note 4]
	Cheer, all directions cheer our advance!
	Thank you to the great affection of the people of the five continents of Asia, Europe, America, Australia, and Africa.
	Thank you to the great affection of the people of the Soviet Union and China.
		Let us advance, who can stop us!
		From Huu Nghi Quan to Ca Mau,
		Is our common sky.
		North and South Vietnam face the same ocean.
		Our hearts rush towards our common leader –
		Ho Chi Minh.
	Our hearts rush towards our common capital,
		Our hearts rush towards our common homeland!

### 我们向共同的目标前进

专栏：

    我们向共同的目标前进
    越南诗人　素友我们走在阳光底下，我们轻快地走在大路上，走在八尺宽的大路上。那是从北山，庭卡通向太原的，那是经过西北的，那是上奠边府的，那是革命的路啊，它跟抗战一道儿成长。今天那通往海洋的路刚刚修筑，看路上泥土是那么红！
  祖国啊，祖国是多么绮丽！
  那儿是楮树林、茶山，
  那儿是芳香的绿田。
  泸江映着闪亮的阳光，
  泸江在汩汩地歌唱。
  在平歌码头那边，渡船儿熙熙攘攘。
    是谁经过了富寿，
    是谁到中河去了，
    是谁到兴化去了，
    是谁到三联区去了，
    是谁到四联区去了。在那儿，我们的道路在自由地喧腾，在那儿，敌人的炮垒统统拆毁。滔江翻起了汹涌的波涛，河内去的，跟我们在这儿一道下船吧。和平来到了，船儿扬起了白帆，看那边，龙州码头就在前面了。
  呵，抗战九年了，
  九年的抗战，我们从不歇息，
  我们的腿和膝盖还是那般健壮。
  昂起我们的头来：
  周围的景色是那般晶莹。
  八月的秋空是那般蔚蓝，
  云朵就在那秋空里自由飞扬。
  那是多么明媚的日子啊！
  那是我们的云彩。
  那是我们深邃的天空，
  那是我们的越南民主共和国！
    敌人的阴影畏缩了，
    八月的穹空永远是那么晴朗。
    在我们重返河内的路上，
    红旗在胡主席银发的四周飘荡！母亲啊，你拭干眼泪吧，敌人逃开我们的村庄了！我们村庄的青竹又冒出了嫩苗，我们的芭蕉园又呈现了一片鲜绿，我们的屋子快扎上了蒲葵叶，我们的田野比往前十年还更欢腾……孩子们，你们进学校了吗？哥哥给你们办了新学校，这学校呵，敌人可别梦想一把火烧掉。孩子们的学校就在秃山那边。孩子们清脆的声浪响彻全村……
  是谁到南部去了，
  是谁到前江，后江去了，
    是谁到那命名为胡志明的城市〔注一〕去
      了，胡志明那灿烂的名字发射着金光。是谁到广阔的同塔梅探访去了。那北越、南越的土地埋葬着敌人的尸体。那土地是我们根生土长的地方！是谁到广南、广义、富安、平定、庆和去了，是谁到藩朗、藩切去了，是谁到西原、昆嵩、多乐去了，那儿是我们的五联区，五联区长长地躺在中越中间！
  是谁回到了我们可爱的家乡，
  我们的家乡哪，就是香江，槟赫、嵩门江那边。到哪儿去的人哪，告诉我们那儿的同胞、同志：我们的国家是越南民主共和国的！我们是同一个父亲生的，我们的骨肉相连，我们的心心相印。
  不管谁花言巧语，
  我们的心仍像三足鼎般的牢稳；
  不管谁围上层层篱笆把我们隔离，
  我们的心仍然深信是胡主席领导的人民。我们在硝烟炮火里成长了。法国盗贼千万别梦想挡住我们英雄民族的前进，那是在革命阳光照耀下我们的工人农民在前进。我们黑门、巴丝、谅山〔注二〕的同胞在前进。
    呵，奠边府光辉的捷报震撼了全球，
    我们站起来了，
    让封建制度埋葬在深深的泥土里。
      我们前进吧，前进在我们的路上，
        继续前进在我们的路上。
      我们像钢铁那么坚强，
      我们的队伍是那么浩荡，
      我们的队伍像高山那么稳，
      我们的队伍像大江那么长，
      我们的队伍像面前东海那么壮阔！
    欢呼啊，欢呼我们的弟兄——
    欢呼依萨拉，〔注三〕
    欢呼依萨拉克！〔注四〕
    欢呼啊，四面八方都在欢呼我们前进！
    感谢亚、欧、美、澳、非五大洲人民伟大的深情。
    感谢苏联、中国人民伟大的深情。
      我们前进吧，谁能挡住我们！
      从睦南关到金瓯滩地，
      都是我们共同的天空。
      北越、南越共临着一个海洋。
      我们的心奔向共同的领袖——
      胡志明。
    我们的心奔向共同的首都，
      我们的心奔向共同的国土！
                              （陈石狮译）〔注一〕即西贡市，一九四五年命名为胡志明市。
                                    ——译者〔注二〕即越南一九四五年八月革命前老革命根据地。
      黑门在南越，巴丝在中越，谅山在北越——译者〔注三〕高棉语。即高棉自由民族统一战线。——译者〔注四〕寮国语。即寮国自由民族统一战线。——译者
