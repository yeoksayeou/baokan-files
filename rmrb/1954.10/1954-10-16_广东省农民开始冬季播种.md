Guangdong farmers have started winter planting. In the Chao-Shan area, where the production season starts earlier, many farmers have already planted sweet potatoes in the late rice fields that are heading and flowering. In the western Guangdong area, winter rice planting has begun.

This year, Guangdong Province plans to plant 18 million mu of winter crops, including sweet potatoes, wheat, oil crops, and green manure crops, an increase of 60% compared to last year, which is almost half of the province's rice field area. The possible harvest of grain crops alone is equivalent to 2 billion jin of rice. Preparations for this year's winter planting started earlier than last year, and it is estimated that all planting can be completed by early December.

    广东省农民开始冬季播种
    四季如春的广东省，农民已开始进行冬种。生产季节较早的潮汕地区，很多农民已在抽穗扬花的晚稻田里种了红薯。粤西区开始播种冬水稻。
    今年广东省计划种植红薯、小麦、油料和绿肥作物等冬种作物一千八百万亩，比去年扩大百分之六十，差不多等于全省水稻田面积的一半。其中仅粮食作物部分的可能的收获量，就相当于二十亿斤稻谷。今年冬种的准备工作比去年提早，估计十二月上旬可全部种下去。
