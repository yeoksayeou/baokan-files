    Various Places Actively Arrange This Year's Winter Study Work
    Various places are actively arranging this year's winter study work in conjunction with the dissemination of the spirit of the First National Conference on Farmers' Spare-time Cultural Education.
    Provinces and cities are attaching importance to conducting political education for farmers through this year's winter study to raise their socialist consciousness. Beijing has decided that this year's winter study should closely cooperate with the central work, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, continue to carry out in-depth education for farmers on the policies of mutual aid and cooperation, production development, and the worker-peasant alliance, and deeply publicize the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Liaoning Province has decided that political education for farmers will be conducted uniformly in winter studies.
    Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces and cities have all formulated development plans for this year's winter study based on their local conditions. Shandong, Sichuan and other provinces are holding meetings to formulate development plans for this year's winter study. Hebei Province plans to organize 1.6 million farmers to participate in winter studies this year, an increase of 45% over the number of students enrolled last year, and requires the elimination of illiteracy for 350,000 people by the end of the winter study. Hubei Province requires that 450,000 to 500,000 people enroll this winter, eliminating illiteracy for 50,000 to 80,000 people, and requires that 300,000 people persist in year-round study next spring. Jiangxi Province plans to enroll 670,000 people in this year's winter study, an increase of 42.5% over the number of students enrolled last year.
    Various places plan to vigorously organize village cadres to learn culture in this year's winter study. Beijing plans to organize 700 to 800 main township cadres to participate in learning in this year's winter study, and eliminate illiteracy for 160 of these cadres. Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning and other provinces plan to organize not only general village cadres to participate in spare-time winter study, but also determine to take off-the-job study methods to organize rural main cadres to take turns to study. Liaoning Province plans to first hold a study class for village cadres, and gradually promote it after gaining experience. Hebei Province plans to organize cadres to study off the job by special area, and plans to eliminate illiteracy for 1,700 people among village cadres.
    Various places attach special importance to the political and cultural learning of members of agricultural production cooperatives, and advocate the establishment of winter studies in agricultural production cooperatives. Beijing requires that each township in the suburbs should, on the one hand, strengthen leadership over the learning organizations that have been established in agricultural production cooperatives, set an example, and drive other agricultural production cooperatives to run schools; on the other hand, actively help and encourage cooperatives with conditions to run schools to establish learning organizations. Hebei Province requires that 60% to 70% of the more than 31,400 newly established agricultural production cooperatives establish learning organizations.
    Some provinces and cities have also made development and training plans for this year's winter study spare-time teachers. Jiangxi Province plans to increase the number of spare-time teachers for this year's winter study from more than 30,200 last year to more than 47,850, of which more than 23,000 will be centrally trained in counties and cities for a short period of time. Beijing is preparing to conduct a training for all spare-time teachers in the suburbs before the start of winter study. In order to run this year's winter study and future farmers' spare-time cultural education well, Gansu Province has transferred full-time cadres and relevant personnel for eliminating illiteracy from the entire province to Lanzhou for political and professional study from October 6.

    各地积极布置今年冬学工作
    各地正结合第一次全国农民业余文化教育会议精神的传达，积极布置今年的冬学工作。
    各省、市重视通过今年冬学向农民进行政治教育，提高农民的社会主义觉悟。北京市确定今年冬学要密切配合中心工作，在党委的统一领导下，继续深入地向农民进行关于互助合作、发展生产、工农联盟的政策的教育，并深入宣传中华人民共和国宪法。辽宁省确定对农民的政治教育统一在冬学中进行。
    山东、四川、河北、湖北、江西等省、市都根据当地实际情况，订出了今年冬学发展计划。山东、四川等省正在开会制订今年冬学的发展计划。河北省计划今年组织一百六十万农民参加冬学，比去年入学人数增加百分之四十五，到冬学结束时，要求扫除文盲三十五万人。湖北省要求今冬有四十五万到五十万人入学，扫除文盲五万至八万人，并要求明春有三十万人坚持常年学习。江西省计划今年冬学入学人数为六十七万人，比去年入学人数增加百分之四十二点五。
    各地计划在今年冬学中大力组织乡村干部学习文化。北京市计划在今年冬学中组织主要乡干部七、八百人参加学习，在这批干部中要扫除文盲一百六十人。河北、山西、辽宁等省计划除组织一般乡村干部参加冬学业余学习外，并确定采取脱产学习办法，组织农村主要干部轮流地进行学习。辽宁省拟先举办一个乡村干部学习班，取得经验后逐步推广。河北省计划以专署为单位组织干部脱产学习，并计划在乡村干部中扫除文盲一千七百人。
    各地特别重视农业生产合作社社员的政治和文化学习，提倡在农业生产合作社中开办冬学。北京市要求郊区各乡一方面要对农业生产合作社内已经建立起来的学习组织加强领导，作出榜样，带动其他农业生产合作社办学；另一方面要积极帮助和鼓励有条件办学的合作社建立学习组织。河北省要求在新建的三万一千四百多个农业生产合作社中，能有百分之六十至七十的社建立起学习组织。
    有些省、市还作出今年冬学业余教师的发展和训练计划。江西省计划今年冬学业余教师由去年的三万零二百多人增加到四万七千八百五十多人，其中二万三千多人分别集中到县、市进行短期训练。北京市准备在冬学开始前，对全郊区冬学业余教师进行一次训练。甘肃省为了办好今年冬学和今后农民业余文化教育，从十月六日起，已抽调全省扫除文盲专职干部和有关人员在兰州集中进行政治和业务学习。（新华社）
