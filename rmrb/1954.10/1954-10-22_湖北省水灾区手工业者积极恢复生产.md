Hubei Province flood-stricken areas, at all levels of Party committees and People's Governments, vigorously lead handicraft workers to restore and develop production, and support the disaster area people in production for self-relief and rebuilding their homes.

Jiayu, Xiaogan, Huangpi, Mianyang, Daye and other counties have convened handicraft representative meetings or symposiums, to study and resolve the issues of resuming production, supporting the masses in production for self-relief, and other issues, and found specific ways to overcome the difficulties in production, supply and sales. State-owned commercial departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, and handicraft production cooperative federations in Huangpi and other counties have prepared a large number of raw materials for handicraft workers. The Daye County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased more than 300 million yuan worth of handicrafts, and the county's People's Bank has also provided timely loans of 76 million yuan to help handicraft production cooperatives and handicraft production groups solve the problem of insufficient funds.

With the strong support of relevant parties, handicraft workers in various flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province are now full of confidence in their efforts to restore and develop production, and are actively supporting the disaster area people in production for self-relief and rebuilding their homes. The bamboo weaving production group in Fankou Town, Echeng County, moved to the temporary market, Leishan, and immediately resumed production. Group members are weaving fishing baskets and willow awnings for fishing boats day and night. Members of the carpentry production cooperative in Xihe District, Sui County, regardless of wind or rain, ran to places more than ten miles away to build houses for the disaster victims. The ironware production cooperative in the district has supplied disaster victims with more than 200 pieces of shovels, sickles, hoes and daily necessities. More than 1,300 handicraft workers in various districts of Daye have manufactured and supplied more than 100 wooden boats to disaster victims. The sixty-one fishhook workers in the sixth district of the county produce approximately 270,000 fishhooks every day, which timely meets the needs of the disaster victims for production and self-relief.

    湖北省水灾区手工业者积极恢复生产
    湖北省水灾地区的各级党委和人民政府，大力领导手工业者恢复和发展生产，支援灾区人民生产自救和重建家园。
    嘉鱼、孝感、黄陂、沔阳、大冶等县都已召开手工业代表会议或座谈会，研究和解决了恢复生产、支援群众生产自救等问题，找出了克服产、供、销中的困难的具体办法。黄陂等县的国营商业部门、供销合作社和手工业生产合作社联合社，都为手工业者准备了大批原料。大冶县供销合作社已收购三亿多元的手工业品，该县人民银行还及时贷款七千六百万元，帮助手工业生产合作社和手工业生产小组解决了资金不足的困难。
    由于有关方面大力支持，湖北省各水灾地区的手工业者现正信心充沛地努力恢复和发展生产，并积极支援灾区人民生产自救和重整家园。鄂城县樊口镇篾业生产小组搬到临时市场雷山以后，立刻恢复了生产，组员们都不分昼夜地编织渔篓和渔船上用的柳叶棚子。随县淅河区木业生产合作社的社员不管刮风下雨，都跑到十里以外的地方给灾民盖房屋；该区铁业生产合作社已供给灾民铁锹、镰刀、挖锄及日用品二百多件。大冶各区的一千三百多名手工业工人，已制造和供给灾民一百多只木船；该县第六区六十一个渔钩工人，每天生产渔钩约二十七万枚，及时满足了灾民生产自救的要求。
