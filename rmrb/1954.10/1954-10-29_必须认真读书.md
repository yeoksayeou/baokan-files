Reading Marxist-Leninist theory seriously is the most important method for studying it. In the Soviet Union, political study for cadres in service is mainly self-study for those with self-study abilities. The November 1938 resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On How to Conduct Party Propaganda After the Publication of 'A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'" pointed out: The method of independently studying the history and theory of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), a method tested by the personal experience of older Bolsheviks, should be regarded as the main and basic method for cadres to study Marxism-Leninism. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on cadre theoretical education in 1953-1954 also pointed out: "The study method for senior groups should be mainly self-study, and the study method for intermediate groups should in principle be mainly lectures." It can be seen that all cadres with self-study abilities, especially senior cadres, should study independently and read seriously. As for attending classes, listening to reports, and holding discussion meetings, they can only achieve greater results when conducted on the basis of self-study.

In recent years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, the theoretical study of cadres in service has greatly developed. In particular, the study of the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Party's general line during the transition period in the past year or so has greatly improved the socialist consciousness and political enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres, and the enthusiasm and interest in studying theory have also significantly increased. Now many comrades have realized the importance of studying theory and have begun to read seriously. From October 1, 1949, to September 30, 1954, the People's Publishing House alone published a total of 154 kinds of works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, totaling 19,411,000 copies, of which Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" reached 1,479,000 copies; in five years, Comrade Mao Zedong's works were published in 46 kinds (including separate volumes, popular editions, and pamphlets), totaling more than 27 million copies. The magazine "Study," which helps cadres study theory, has become one of the most popular reading materials for the broad masses of cadres, and its current circulation is more than one million copies per issue. The magazine "China Youth," which helps young people study, now has a circulation of more than 1.3 million copies. These unprecedented phenomena in our country's history all show that the enthusiasm of cadres to study theory and their interest in reading are growing.

However, on the other hand, we must also point out that there are still many cadres who do not pay attention to study and do not read seriously. For example: some comrades have no determination to study theory, nor do they have any interest in reading. As soon as they open a book, they feel bored and lack perseverance and determination. They "fish for three days and dry the nets for two," and as a result, half a year or a year has passed, and they haven't even read a book properly, and they are still at ease and indifferent; some comrades are unwilling to study diligently, always wanting to find "secrets" and "shortcuts" for studying theory, simply relying on classes and listening to reports, and are unwilling to use their brains more, learning without thinking, and reading without seeking thorough understanding, so they always feel that they "cannot go deep"; some comrades are not humble and honest in learning, aiming too high and seeking quick success, sometimes pretending to understand when they don't, always trying to decorate themselves and show off, and becoming arrogant and complacent with a little achievement, often "complacent with a single achievement and a one-sided view"; some comrades are willing to study and have an interest in reading, but they do not study properly, do not know how to use their time, have no plan, and have no system, "grabbing a handful of this and a handful of that," spending a lot of time and energy, but achieving half the result with twice the effort, and gaining little... All these ideological styles and learning attitudes are incorrect.

Due to not working hard to study and not reading seriously, many comrades are making very slow progress, lack sensitivity to new things, lack systematic basic knowledge of many political and theoretical issues, and some even cannot understand some basic political common sense. We might as well give an example: Not long ago, the Cultural Bureau of the East China Administrative Committee held a current affairs, political, and literary common sense test for literary and art cadres. More than 600 people participated, including cadres from more than 20 cultural and artistic work units in East China and Shanghai. Although most of the test questions were relatively easy, many people, even some more responsible cadres, could not answer them or did not answer them completely. For example, "What is the task of the Party's general line during the transition period in rural areas?" More than 70% of the people answered incorrectly or incompletely. "Which countries does Indochina include?" More than 50 people answered incorrectly; some people even answered "Guatemala" as a person's name and "Urumqi" as the president of a certain country. Can this phenomenon be regarded as an isolated example and ignored? No. As long as we conduct an in-depth inspection, we will find that similar situations exist in various regions and departments. These indicate the backward state of cadres' political and theoretical level and cultural level.

This serious phenomenon deserves deep attention. We should strive to eradicate this backward state of cadres' political and theoretical level. Stalin once said: In any department of the Party and the state, the higher the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist awareness of the staff, the higher the efficiency of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist awareness of the staff, the more delays and failures in the work, and the easier it is to become shortsighted petty people and degenerate into a bureaucrat. Therefore, in order to eradicate the backward state of cadres' political and theoretical level and to improve cadres' socialist consciousness, we must promote the habit of reading seriously. This is an important issue in the current theoretical study of cadres.

So, what issues should we pay attention to when advocating serious reading? First of all, the broad masses of cadres should deeply understand the significance and role of studying theory. Reading seriously relies on self-consciousness and voluntariness. If the importance of studying theory is not fully understood, there is no strong desire for knowledge and ambition, and striving to study theory and improve the degree of awareness is not regarded as a revolutionary cadre's unavoidable responsibility to the people, it is impossible to read seriously. Therefore, every cadre must clarify this issue ideologically.

The concluding remarks of the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out the role of theory: "The powerful aspect of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in its ability to enable the Party to judge the situation, understand the internal connections of surrounding events, and predict the course of events, not only to know how events are developing and where they are developing in the present, but also to know how events will develop and where they will develop in the future." Therefore, studying theory can enable us, under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory, to correctly understand the laws and prospects of the development of real life, thereby gaining the ability to determine work policies and the grasp of carrying out work, and strengthening our belief that our cause will inevitably be victorious. Otherwise, if our work deviates from the guidance of theory, it is like groping forward in the dark, and we will inevitably stumble and take many detours. If we think carefully: Why is our understanding of the Party's policies and the instructions of higher authorities not profound enough, why is our analysis of the situation below not accurate enough, why are we not good at summarizing past experiences, and why do we lack foresight for the future? ... Isn't this all because our theoretical level is not high? Hasn't this already caused losses to the Party's work? Especially now, our country has entered a new historical period, that is, the period of socialist revolution, which is a more profound and extensive revolution than the new democratic revolution. The class struggle is becoming increasingly complex and acute, the struggle between everything new and old is constantly developing, real life is constantly emerging with a large number of new problems, and revolutionary practice is constantly raising many difficult tasks. If we do not study theory and do not work under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, but advance blindly and work randomly everywhere, it is impossible to realize our great ideal of building a socialist society.

As for a Communist Party member, striving to study Marxism-Leninism and constantly improving one's own degree of awareness is one of the essential conditions for a Party member. Now many comrades' ideological and theoretical level is very incompatible with the requirements of the work we are undertaking, so we should work even harder.

Studying theory requires reading in a planned and systematic way. Marxism-Leninism has its system. When we still lack systematic basic theoretical knowledge, our ability to independently solve problems will be limited. Therefore, we must never be satisfied with only some scattered and disorganized knowledge. We should gradually gain a complete understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory in the learning process in a planned and step-by-step manner. For example, dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economy, history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), history of the Communist Party of China... These basic courses of Marxism-Leninism are compulsory for every senior cadre and should be read by all cadres with self-study abilities. Therefore, comrades who are conducting self-study should formulate their personal study plans based on their own theoretical accomplishments and characteristics and should always read according to the plan.

It should be known that there are difficulties in the process of implementing the study plan, especially for comrades with lower theoretical levels and no reading habits, who will feel more difficulties. But as long as we have determination, difficulties can always be overcome. Today our learning has many favorable conditions. In fact, in recent years, many comrades have made great progress due to their hard work. The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On How to Conduct Party Propaganda After the Publication of 'A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'" stated: "It is wrong to think that mastering theory is a task that only a small number of staff can accomplish. Mastering Marxist-Leninist theory is something that can be achieved... In order to master Marxist-Leninist theory, it is enough to have the desire, the determination to achieve this goal, and a persevering character." Therefore, we should have a high degree of enthusiasm and strong will, not be afraid of hardship, and overcome all difficulties on the road to learning, and fight to master the weapon of Marxism-Leninism.

At the same time, learning theory requires humility and honesty, and should not be arrogant and complacent. Marxism-Leninism is science, and science is honest and down-to-earth learning, and can only be treated with a pragmatic attitude. Any bit of mischief is not allowed. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party: "The enemy of learning is one's own complacency. To seriously learn something, one must start with not being complacent. For oneself, 'never tired of learning'; for others, 'never tired of teaching.' We should take this attitude."

Many comrades often say: "I'm very busy! I really don't have time to study." It is a fact that work is busy, especially now that we are engaged in the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. The task is extremely arduous, everything is very unfamiliar, and we lack experience. No matter what work position we are in, it is indeed very tense. But the question is how can we squeeze time out of our busy schedule to study, and we must never use being busy as an excuse not to study. Can we squeeze out time? Some comrades often chat for an hour or two, and can dance, play chess, and play poker until late at night, but say they don't have time to study. Some comrades have no plan for work, are not clear-headed, have many long meetings, are busy and bureaucratic, and naturally feel that they have no time to study. If we can truly cherish time and seize time, and pay attention to improving work methods and arranging time reasonably, we can always squeeze out some time to study. If we can squeeze out an hour a day to read, and persevere, slowly but surely, we can read a lot of things over time. Can't we really spare an hour a day? Therefore, in fact, this is not a question of whether there is time or not, but whether one is willing to learn and whether one cherishes time and is good at allocating time.

Here, we should take the classic writers as our role models. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin all closely combined work and study, and all treasured time and were good at allocating time. Although their work during their lifetimes was much busier than ours, they never interrupted their study and writing, even under the most difficult conditions. For example, Marx spent a full forty years writing "Capital." He read more than 1,500 thick volumes of books for writing this book. For example, when Lenin was exiled to Siberia in February 1897, he strictly allocated his time in that desolate and lonely corner, where conditions were extremely difficult, repeatedly reading Marx and Engels' works carefully, browsing various books, learning foreign languages, and engaging in translation and writing. During the three years of exile, he wrote more than 30 kinds of works, including the famous works "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" and "The Tasks of the Russian Social Democrats." From this, it can be seen how great their spirit of hard work was.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The important thing is to be good at learning." Advocating serious reading does not mean chewing words and phrases, memorizing books by rote, and reciting formulas and conclusions in books without paying attention to understanding their essence. That is a dogmatic learning attitude. As early as in his works "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," and "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," Comrade Mao Zedong vehemently denounced the scourge of dogmatism and vigorously advocated learning theory with a Marxist-Leninist attitude, with a creative method, that is, the method of linking theory with practice. This learning method believes that the most important issue in studying theory is not to memorize its words, but to understand its essence and revolutionary spirit, and to learn to use Marxist-Leninist viewpoints and methods to solve various practical problems under various conditions, and to regard theory as a guide to action in social and political life and personal life.

Therefore, in our learning process, in order to strengthen the connection between theory and practice, we should not only systematically and seriously read Marxist-Leninist theoretical works, but also pay attention to studying the policies of the Party and the government, familiarize ourselves with real life, and connect with the practice of socialist construction. The policies of the Party and the government are the result of collective discussion, are the concentrated expression of problems in real life, represent the fundamental interests of the masses, and most profoundly embody the connection between theory and practice. When we pay attention to studying policies, we can understand real life and grasp the Party's policies, and we can also understand how the Party is implementing its policies with a creative spirit, following Marxist-Leninist theory, and shifting with specific historical conditions. The reason why we must familiarize ourselves with real life is because our purpose in studying theory is not for anything else, but to improve socialist consciousness and master the invincible weapon of Marxism-Leninism to build our new life. If we are not familiar with life at all, nor do we care about the cause of socialist construction, then it becomes aimless abstract learning, which is "shooting without a target."

Finally, it should be pointed out that advocating serious reading certainly relies on the consciousness and enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres, but on the other hand, it cannot lack the leadership and supervision of the Party. The idea that advocating self-study means letting it go without the need for Party leadership and supervision is completely wrong. Experience has proved that only by implementing the principle of combining self-study with Party leadership and supervision can the theoretical study of cadres develop healthily. Therefore, when all Party organizations lead cadres to study, they should also advocate the habit of reading seriously, strengthen the inspection and supervision of Party members' and cadres' self-study, strengthen guidance work, help them solve ideological problems and difficult problems in learning; and carry out criticism and self-criticism, give due praise to those comrades who read seriously and have achievements in learning, and give persuasive education and appropriate criticism to those comrades who are lazy to read and do not seek progress. Only in this way can the habit of reading seriously be gradually established.

    必须认真读书
    沙英
    学习马克思列宁主义理论最重要的方法是认真读书。苏联在职干部的政治学习，凡是有自修能力的人都是以自学为主的。一九三八年十一月联共（布）中央“关于‘联共（布）党史简明教程’出版后怎样进行党的宣传”的决议指出：独立研究联共
  （布）的历史和理论的方法，乃是由老辈布尔什维克亲身经验所考验过的方法，应当作为干部学习马克思列宁主义的主要方法和基本方法。中共中央关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示中也曾指出：“高级组的学习方法以自学为主，中级组的学习方法在原则上以上课为主。”由此可见，凡是有自修能力的干部，特别是高级干部，都应当独立自修，认真读书。至于上课、听报告和开讨论会等，只有在自修的基础上去进行，才能收到较大的效果。
    近几年来，在党中央和各级党委的领导下，在职干部的理论学习获得了很大的发展。特别是近一年多以来对于联共（布）党史和党在过渡时期的总路线的学习，使广大干部的社会主义觉悟和政治积极性大大提高了，学习理论的热情和兴趣也显著提高了。现在已有许多同志认识到学习理论的重要性而开始认真读书了。自一九四九年十月一日起至一九五四年九月三十日止，仅人民出版社出版的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，合计就有一百五十四种共达一千九百四十一万一千册，其中斯大林的
  “苏联社会主义经济问题”一书的印数达一百四十七万九千册；五年间毛泽东同志的著作出版了四十六种（包括分卷本、普及本和单行本）合计达二千七百万余册。帮助干部学习理论的刊物“学习”杂志，已成为广大干部最喜爱的读物之一，现在它每期的发行量都在百万份以上。帮助青年学习的刊物
  “中国青年”，现在的发行量在一百三十万份以上。这些在我国历史上前所未有的现象，都说明干部学习理论的积极性和读书的兴趣在日益增长。
    可是另一方面我们也不能不指出，至今还有不少干部存在着一种不重视学习和不认真读书的现象。譬如说：有些同志对学习理论没有决心，也没有读书的兴趣，他们一翻开书本，便觉得索然无味，并且缺乏恒心和毅力，“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，结果一年半载过去了，竟然连一本书也没有好好看，甚至还安之若素，毫不在乎；有些同志不愿意刻苦钻研，总想寻找学习理论的“秘诀”和“捷径”，单纯依赖上课和听报告，也不愿多用脑筋，学而不思，读书不求甚解，所以总感到“深入不下去”；有些同志对学习不虚心，不老实，好高骛远，急于求成，有时不懂也装懂，处处装璜自己，卖弄自己，稍有成绩便骄傲自满，常常“沾沾自喜于一得之功和一孔之见”；有些同志虽然愿意学习，对读书也有兴趣，但是学习不得法，不会利用时间，没有计划，没有系统，“东抓一把，西抓一把”，时间和精力花费了很多，结果却事倍功半，收获不大。……所有这些思想作风和学习态度都是不正确的。
    由于不努力学习、不认真读书，很多同志进步很慢，对新鲜事物缺乏敏感，对许多政治理论问题缺乏系统的基本知识，有的甚至连一些政治常识也弄不清楚。我们不妨举一个例子：不久以前华东行政委员会文化局举行了一次文艺干部的时事政治和文艺常识测验，参加者六百多人，包括华东一级和上海市二十多个文化艺术工作单位的干部，虽然试题绝大部分都是比较容易的，但仍有许多人以至一部分比较负责的干部，竟答不出或答得不完全。例如“党在过渡时期的总路线在农村方面的任务是什么？”有十分之七以上的人回答得不正确或不完全。“印度支那包括那几个国家？”有五十多个人回答错了；甚至有人竟把“危地马拉”答作人名，把“乌鲁木齐”答作是某国的总统。这种现象能不能当作个别的例子而加以忽视呢？不能的。只要我们深入地检查一下，就会发现类似这样的情况在各地区和各部门中都是存在着的。这些表明了干部的政治理论水平和文化水平的落后状态。
    这种严重的现象是值得深刻注意的。我们应当努力铲除这种干部的政治理论水平的落后状态。斯大林曾经说过：在党和国家任何一个部门的工作中，工作人员的政治水平和马克思列宁主义的觉悟程度愈高，工作的效率也就愈高；反过来说，工作人员的政治水平和马克思列宁主义觉悟愈低，工作中的延误和失败也就愈多，也就愈容易变为鼠目寸光的小人和堕落为一个事务主义者。因此，为了铲除干部的政治理论水平的落后状态，为了提高干部的社会主义觉悟，我们必须提倡认真读书的风气。这是当前干部理论学习中的一个重要问题。
    那么提倡认真读书要注意解决一些什么问题呢？首先，广大干部应当深刻地认识学习理论的意义和作用。认真读书靠自觉自愿，如果对学习理论的重要性认识不足，没有强烈的求知欲和上进心，不把努力学习理论、提高觉悟程度当作是一个革命干部对人民不可推诿的职责，那是不可能认真读书的。因此，每一个干部都要从思想上搞通这个问题。
    联共（布）党史的结束语曾这样指出理论的作用：“马克思列宁主义理论强有力的地方，就在于它能使党能判明局势，能了解周围事变底内在联系，能预察事变底进程，不仅能察知事变在目前怎样发展和向何处发展，而且能察知事变在将来会怎样发展和向何处发展。”因此，学习理论就能使我们在马克思列宁主义理论的指导下，正确认识现实生活的发展规律和发展前途，从而获得确定工作方针的能力和进行工作的把握，坚定我们的事业必然胜利的信念。否则，如果我们的工作脱离了理论的指导，那就彷佛在黑暗中摸索前进，必然要跌交子和走许多弯路。假如我们仔细地想一想：自己对党的政策和上级指示为何理解得不深刻，对下面的情况为何分析得不准确，为什么对过去的经验不善于总结，为什么对未来的东西缺乏预见？……这难道不都是因为我们的理论水平不高吗？这难道不已经使党的工作受到损失吗？特别是现在，我们的国家已进入了一个新的历史时期，即社会主义革命时期，这是一个比新民主主义革命更深刻更广泛的革命，阶级斗争日益复杂和尖锐化，一切新与旧的斗争不断地发展着，现实生活不断涌现出大量新的问题，革命实践不断提出许多困难的任务，如果我们不学习理论，不在马克思列宁主义的指导下来工作，盲目前进，到处乱干，那就不可能实现我们建成社会主义社会的伟大理想。
    至于对一个共产党员来说，努力学习马克思列宁主义，不断提高自己的觉悟程度，乃是一个党员必备的条件之一。现在有许多同志的思想理论水平同我们所担负的工作的要求很不相称，所以更应当加倍努力。
    学习理论要求有计划有系统地读书。马克思列宁主义是有它的系统的，当我们还缺乏系统的基本理论知识时，就使我们独立地解决问题的能力受到限制，所以我们决不能满足仅有的一些零星散乱的知识，我们应当在学习过程中有计划地循序渐进，去逐步获得对于马克思列宁主义理论的完整的了解。譬如像辩证唯物论和历史唯物论、政治经济学、联共（布）党史、中共党史……这些马克思列宁主义的基本课程，是每一个高级干部所必修的，也是一切有自修能力的干部应当阅读的。因此，进行自修的同志都应当根据自己的理论修养和特点订出个人的学习计划，经常按照计划来读书。
    要知道，在执行学习计划的过程中是存在着困难的，尤其理论水平较低和没有读书习惯的同志，就会感到困难更多一些。但是只要我们有决心，困难总是可以克服的。今天我们的学习已经具备了许多有利的条件。事实上，几年来已有不少同志由于努力钻研而获得了很大的进步。联共（布）中央“关于‘联共（布）党史简明教程’出版后怎样进行党的宣传”的决议中说道：“如果以为通晓理论只是一小部分工作人员所能胜任的任务，那就错误了。通晓马克思列宁主义理论，乃是可以做到的事情。……为着通晓马克思列宁主义理论，只要有志愿，有一定要达到这个目的的决心和坚毅性格就够了。”因此，我们应当有高度的积极性和坚强的意志，不畏劳苦，来克服学习道路上的一切困难，为掌握马克思列宁主义这个武器而斗争。
    同时，学习理论要虚心老实，不能骄傲自满。马克思列宁主义是科学，科学是老老实实的学问，只能以实事求是的态度对待它，任何一点调皮都是不行的。毛泽东同志在党的六届六中全会上指示我们说：“学习的敌人是自己的自满，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。对自己，‘学而不厌’，对人家，‘诲人不倦’，我们应取这种态度。”
    有许多同志常常这样说：“忙得很呀！实在没有时间学习。”工作繁忙，这是事实，特别是现在我们正从事伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的工作，任务极为艰巨，一切都很生疏，缺少经验，无论处在那一个工作岗位上，确实都是很紧张的。但是问题就在于我们如何能从百忙中挤出时间来学习，绝不能以工作忙为借口而不进行学习。能不能挤出时间来呢？有的同志常常闲谈起来就是一两小时，跳舞、下棋、打扑克可以玩至深夜，但却说没有时间学习。也有些同志对工作没有计划，头脑不清醒，会议多而冗长，忙忙碌碌，事务主义，自然也就感到没有时间学习。假如我们能真正爱惜时间和抓紧时间，并注意改进工作方法，合理地安排时间，总是可以挤出一些时间来学习的。假如我们一天能挤出一小时来读书，坚持下去，细水长流，日子多了，便可以读不少东西。难道我们真的一天抽不出一小时来吗？因此，实际上这不是有没有时间的问题，而是愿不愿意学和是否爱惜时间及善于支配时间的问题。
    这里，我们应当以经典作家们作为我们的榜样。马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林，都是工作同学习密切结合、都是非常珍贵时间和善于支配时间的。虽然他们生前的工作要比我们繁忙得多，但是他们从不间断学习和写作，那怕在最困难的条件下也是坚持不懈。例如马克思写作“资本论”，整整用了四十年的工夫。他为写作这本书而阅读的书籍，就有一千五百厚册以上。再如列宁在一八九七年二月开始被流放到西伯利亚去的时候，在那荒凉寂寞的角落里，条件极为困难，但他却严格分配自己的时间，再三精读马克思和恩格斯的著作，博览各种书籍，学习外国文字，从事翻译和写作。在流放的三年当中，他共写了三十多种作品，其中有“俄国资本主义的发展”、“俄国社会民主党人底任务”等有名的著作。从此可以看出，他们努力钻研的精神是多么伟大。
    毛泽东同志教导我们说：“重要的问题在善于学习”。提倡认真读书，绝不是说要咬文嚼字，死啃书本，去背诵书本上的公式和结论，而不去注意领会它的实质。那是一种教条主义的学习态度。毛泽东同志早在“改造我们的学习”和“整顿党的作风”“反对党八股”等著作中，就深恶痛绝地指斥了教条主义的毒害，而极力提倡以马克思列宁主义的态度、以创造性的方法即理论联系实际的方法去学习理论。这种学习方法认为：学习理论最重要的问题，不在于熟记它的字句，而是要领会它的实质和革命精神，学会在各种条件下运用马克思列宁主义的观点和方法去解决各种实际问题，把理论当作社会政治生活和个人生活中的行动指南。
    因此，在我们的学习过程中，为了加强理论与实际的联系，不仅要有系统地认真阅读马克思列宁主义的理论著作，而且要注意学习党和政府的政策，熟悉实际生活，联系社会主义建设的实践。党和政府的政策，是集体讨论的结果，是现实生活中的问题的集中表现，代表着群众的根本利益，最深刻地体现了理论和实际的联系。我们注意学习政策，既可以明了现实生活和掌握党的政策，又可以明了党是如何以创造性的精神，遵循着马克思列宁主义的理论，以具体的历史条件为转移而实行着自己的政策。我们所以要熟悉实际生活，这是因为我们学习理论的目的不是为了别的，就是为了提高社会主义的觉悟和掌握马克思列宁主义这个百战百胜的武器来建设我们新的生活，如果我们根本不熟悉生活，也不关怀社会主义的建设事业，那么就变成了无目的的抽象的学习，那就是“无的放矢”。
    最后应当指出，提倡认真读书，固然要依靠广大干部的自觉性和积极性，但另一方面也不能缺少党的领导和监督。那种认为提倡自修就可以任其自流而不必要党的领导和监督的想法是完全错误的。经验证明，只有实行自学同党的领导和监督相结合的原则，那才能保证干部理论学习健康地发展。因此，一切党的组织在领导干部学习时，也要提倡认真读书的风气，加强对党员、干部的自修的检查和监督，加强辅导工作，帮助他们解决学习中的思想问题和疑难问题；并且要开展批评和自我批评，对那些认真读书和学习有成绩的同志给以应得的表扬，对于那些懒于读书、不求上进的同志给以说服教育和适当的批评。只有这样，才能把认真读书的风气逐渐树立起来。
