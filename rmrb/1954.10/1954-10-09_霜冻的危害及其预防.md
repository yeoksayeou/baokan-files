    The Hazards of Frost and Its Prevention
    Central Meteorological Bureau Compilation Office
    This year, many areas have late-planted or replanted crops, and the harvest period is delayed, increasing the possibility of frost damage. According to forecasts, this year's first frost may not be earlier than the earliest first frost in previous years, but it may be earlier than the average first frost in previous years. Therefore, doing a good job in preventing frost has great significance.

      I. What is Frost, and What is Frost Damage?

    Frost is a freezing phenomenon. When the ground or near-ground objects are affected by the advection of cold air, or lose heat due to their own radiation, or are affected by both of these factors, and cool to below zero degrees, the air encounters the cold ground or near-ground object surface and cools to the "frost point." Then, the water vapor in the air condenses on the ground or near-ground object surface, forming frost. The formation of frost is not only related to weather conditions but also to the properties of the ground objects. Often, under the same weather conditions, in the same area, there may be frost in one location, but none in another. In the same location, there may be frost on one object, but not on others.
    The so-called "frost damage" usually refers to the freezing damage that occurs simultaneously with frost. When frost forms, the temperature of the near-surface air layer suddenly drops below zero degrees, and often below the minimum temperature required by certain plants at a certain stage of development, so plants are often damaged at this time.
    Frost damage is a phenomenon in which the temperature at the soil surface, plant surface, and near-ground air layer drops below zero degrees for a short period when the average daily temperature in the atmosphere six feet above the ground is still above zero degrees. Therefore, there may or may not be frost when frost damage occurs; but regardless of whether there is frost or not, if the temperature is lower than the minimum temperature required by a certain plant at its stage of development, the plant will be harmed.

      II. The Harm of Frost Damage to Crops

    The reason why frost damage is harmful to crops, generally speaking, is that temperatures below zero degrees can cause water between cells to form ice crystals, absorb water that seeps out of the cells and freeze. This not only consumes the water in the cells but also causes the cells to be mechanically compressed and ruptured as the ice crystals gradually increase in size. It also causes protein precipitation, thus causing the death of crops.
    The degree of damage to crops from frost is related to the variety and growth stage of the crops. As is well known, the cold resistance of various crops is different. Crops sown in early spring, legume crops, and oil crops have the strongest cold resistance and can withstand short periods of frost from minus seven to ten degrees Celsius; corn, millet, sorghum, and potatoes are second, and can withstand short periods of frost from minus two to three degrees Celsius; cotton and melons have the worst cold resistance and can only withstand frost from minus one to two degrees Celsius. Secondly, the cold resistance of the same crop also varies at different stages of growth. Crops have the worst cold resistance during the flowering stage.
    The degree of temperature drop, suddenness, and duration of frost are also factors that determine the extent of damage to crops. Each crop requires a certain minimum temperature at each stage of growth. Below this temperature, the plant will die. Therefore, when there is frost, the lower the temperature drops, the greater the damage. However, the cold resistance of plants can be strengthened within a certain temperature range. If the temperature gradually decreases, it will be conducive to the accumulation of sugar in plant cells, increasing their cold resistance. If a sudden drop in temperature to below zero degrees occurs when the average daily temperature is above zero degrees, the plant will be damaged because its cold resistance has not had time to be strengthened. In addition, a long duration of frost is more harmful to crops, and a short duration is less harmful.

      III. Prevention of Frost Damage

    Now is the time to prevent the first frost. Under the current circumstances, there are two effective methods that can be used in our country to prevent the first frost:

    1. Smoke Smudging – This method usually involves using smoke piles to produce smoke. Applying this method can keep a large number of smoke particles in the air. On the one hand, these smoke particles can absorb radiant heat from the ground, and on the other hand, they can serve as condensation nuclei, facilitating the formation of fog. At the same time, the carbon dioxide released during smoking can also absorb radiant heat from the ground. All of these can prevent the ground from dissipating heat too quickly and raise the temperature of the near-surface air layer, preventing the occurrence of frost. However, if the smoke piles are not made well and the smoke smudging technique is not mastered, it is not easy to achieve the effect of keeping warm and preventing freezing during smoking. The size of the smoke piles and the amount of materials used should be determined according to the duration of the frost. If the frost occurs after 2:00 AM and lasts for a short period, then smoking for three to five hours is sufficient.
    The Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry Meteorological Station and the Kaifeng Meteorological Observatory in Henan Province have a very good method for making smoke piles. Their approach is: first, dig a round pit with a diameter of one and a half feet and a depth of four to five inches on the edge of the field. Bury a wooden stake with a diameter of about two to three inches in the center of the round pit. Pile dry wheat straw or shavings and other flammable materials around the wooden stake, then put a layer of relatively dry bean stalks (not as flammable as wheat straw), the third layer is firewood, the fourth layer is bean stalks, and the fifth layer is wheat bran, leaves, or thatch, etc., then sprinkle some water on it (do not get it too wet), and finally cover it with a layer of soil about one inch thick, and the smoke pile is made. The part of the smoke pile above the ground is about one foot and two inches high, and the total height including the pit depth is about one foot and five or six inches. The horizontal diameter of the smoke pile is about two feet and five inches.
    Such smoke piles should be made every one and a half to two lengths apart on the downwind side or around the field, so that a smoke screen can be formed in the lower air. However, in specific applications, it is also necessary to flexibly grasp the conditions of the land, the weather at the time, and material and human resources.
    When lighting the fire, pull out the wooden stake, light a handful of prepared wheat straw, and slowly put it into the mouth of the pulled-out wooden stake. This will quickly burn the materials in the pile and emit a large amount of smoke from the pile. The smoke flows horizontally towards the protected fields with the gentle breeze. The smoke from the smoke pile generally becomes denser as it burns. If the smoke is not dense enough due to the pile being too wet, it is better to dig another hole next to the smoke outlet to let some air in.
    The smoke piles made in this way are better than those made of wheat straw without covering the top with soil. Using this form of smoke piles for smoking can not only produce thick smoke, but also is not easy to catch fire and burn out the smoke pile quickly. The ash pile after burning can also become a good fertilizer.

    2. Wrapping Method – Wrapping plants with paper, straw, or other materials can also prevent them from being damaged by frost. However, this method is labor-intensive and costly, and can only be used on a small scale (such as orchards) for more valuable plants, and is difficult to apply on a large scale.

    In addition, watering the fields before the arrival of frost can also prevent frost. However, experiments have shown that this method is not suitable for preventing the first frost.

      IV. Several Issues in Preventing Frost Damage

    1. The method of pulling with a rope or sweeping with a broom must not be used. Many places have used this method, but the damage to wheat is even greater. This is because after frost occurs, the wheat stalks and leaves are frozen hard. Pulling them will injure the wheat, and they will gradually wither after the sun comes out.
    2. When using the smoke smudging method, the smoking time must not be too early or too late. Some places, as soon as they hear that there will be frost at night, light fires and smoke in the evening. Others do not light the smoke piles until white frost appears, and then leave them alone. None of these can achieve the desired effect. Smoking should begin when the air temperature at the equivalent of the leaf surface height is between one and two degrees Celsius. Smoking too early is not economical in terms of human and material resources, and smoking too late will reduce the frost prevention effect or even be ineffective.
    3. It is necessary to accurately and timely grasp the temperature situation. In order to understand the temperature situation and grasp the smoking start time on nights when frost damage may occur, some places hang wet towels and start smoking after the towels freeze; others hang thermometers on trees; others put thermometers in their pockets and take them out to check them at regular intervals; others observe thermometers indoors; others take a long time to observe the thermometer and breathe on it, etc. All of these are inappropriate. Hanging wet towels is not appropriate because its height is not fixed, but the temperature varies with height, and there are also situations where wet towels do not begin to freeze until it is several degrees below zero. Thermometers hung on trees, placed in pockets, or indoors, the temperatures they show cannot represent the temperature in the fields. The thermometer should be placed in the wheat field and should not be too close to the edge of the field. It should be placed at the same height as the wheat leaves, supported by small bamboo poles or wooden sticks, so that the bulb does not touch the wheat leaves. Observe the thermometer quickly and hold your breath.

    Some rural areas may not have thermometers. A large axe or other black, unrusted iron object can be placed in the low-lying areas of the field. If there is frost, it will generally condense on the axe or iron object about one hour earlier than the ground crops. Therefore, if you find frost on the axe or other iron object, and the sky has only a light breeze, light clouds, and no major changes, immediately light a fire and smoke, which is very timely. Sometimes there may be no frost on the axe but still frost damage, but this situation is rare.

    霜冻的危害及其预防
    中央气象局编译室
    今年不少地区晚种或补种的作物很多，收获期延迟，遭受霜冻的可能性很大。根据预报，今年的初霜冻虽然不会比历年最早的初霜期要早，但可能比历年平均初霜期早些。因此作好霜冻的预防工作，就有重大的意义。
      一、什么叫霜，什么叫霜冻
    霜是一种冻结现象。当地面或近地物体，因受冷空气平流的影响，或因本身辐散失热，或因同时受这两种作用影响，而冷却至零度以下时，空气遇到了冷的地面或近地物体表面而降温至“霜点”，于是空气中的水汽便凝结于地面或近地物体表面上，形成了霜。霜的形成，不仅与天气条件有关，而且也和地面物体的属性有关。往往在同样天气条件下，同一地区里，在这一地段上可以有霜，而在另一地段上却可能没有。在同一地段上，也往往在这一物体上有霜，另外一些物体上没有。
    平常所谓“霜害”，实际上主要是和霜同时发生的冻害。形成霜时，近地面气层温度骤然降到零度以下，并往往低于某些植物在一定发育阶段所要求的最低温度，所以这时常有植物受到损害。
    霜冻是在距地面六尺高的大气中，日平均气温还在零度以上的时候，在土壤表面、植物表面及近地面气层发生的短时间温度降到零度以下的现象。因此，产生霜冻时可以有霜，也可以无霜；但不管有霜或无霜，如果温度低于某种植物在它的发育阶段所需要的最低温度，植物便会受害。
      二、霜冻对农作物的害处
    霜冻所以有害于农作物，一般说来，是因为零度以下的低温可使细胞之间的水形成冰晶，吸取细胞中渗透出来的水分而冻结起来，这样便不仅消耗了细胞的水分，而且还因冰晶逐渐增大，使细胞受到机械的压缩以致破裂，同时也引起蛋白质的沉淀，于是造成了农作物的死亡。
    霜冻对农作物受害的程度，和农作物的品种及生长阶段有关。如所周知，各种农作物的耐寒能力是各不相同的。早春播种的作物、豆类作物、油料作物等耐寒能力最强，可经受零下七度到十度的短时间霜冻；玉米、黍稷、马铃薯等次之，可经受零下二度到三度的短时间霜冻；棉花、瓜类等耐寒能力最差，只能经受零下一度到二度的霜冻。其次，同一种农作物的耐寒能力，在各个生长阶段也有所不同。农作物在开花阶段的耐寒能力最差。
    霜冻的降温程度、突然性和它的持续时间等也是决定农作物受害大小的因素。每一种农作物在每
  一生长阶段要求一定的最低温度，低于这个温度，植物就要死亡。因此有霜冻时，温度降得越低，为害便越大。但植物的耐寒能力在一定的温度范围内是可以锻炼的。气温如果逐渐降低，便有利于植物的细胞里聚积起醣分来，使其耐寒力加大。如果在日平均气温高于零度的时候，突然发生了气温降低到零度以下的现象，由于植物的耐寒能力还没来得及加强，这样便要受到冻害。此外，霜冻持续时间长对农作物为害大，持续时间短为害就要小些。
      三、霜冻的预防
    现在正是预防初霜冻的时候。在目前情况下，我国可以采用的预防初霜冻的有效办法有以下两种：
    1、熏烟法——这种方法通常是用做烟堆来熏烟的。应用这种方法，可使空气中存有大量烟粒，这些烟粒，一方面可吸收地面的辐射热，另方面又可作为凝结核，而便于雾的形成，同时熏烟时放出的二氧化碳也可吸收地面的辐射热。所有这些，都能阻止地面散热过快而使近地面气层的温度升高，阻止霜冻的发生。但如果烟堆做得不好，熏烟技术没掌握好，熏烟时也不易起到保温防冻的作用。烟堆的大小和所用材料的多少应当根据霜冻时间的长短来决定。如果霜冻在夜间二时以后发生，维持时间很短，那么熏三小时到五小时的烟就够了。
    河南省农林厅气象总站和河南省开封气象台做烟堆的方法很好。他们的做法是：先在地边挖一个直径一尺半、深四寸到五寸的圆坑，在圆坑中心埋一直径约二寸到三寸的木桩，在木桩周围堆干麦秸或刨花等易燃材料，然后放上一层较干的豆秸（不像麦秸那样易燃），第三层放花柴，第四层放豆秸，第五层放麦糠、树叶或茅草等，再在上面泼些水（不要泼得过湿），最后盖一层约厚一寸左右的土，这样烟堆就做成了。烟堆在地面以上的部分，约高一尺二寸左右，连坑深共约高一尺五、六寸，烟堆的水平直径约为二尺五寸。
    这样的烟堆，在上风处的地边或地的四周，宜每隔一丈半到二丈远作一个，便可在低层空气中形成烟幕。但在具体应用时，还要看土地情况、当时的天气及物力、人力等条件灵活掌握。
    点火时，将木桩拔出，把准备好的一把麦秸点着，慢慢放入拔出木桩的口中，便可很快地燃烧堆内的材料，并从堆内发出大量的烟来。烟随着轻风水平地流向防护的田地上去。烟堆一般是越燃烟越浓的，如因堆内太潮湿而烟不大时，在烟口旁边再挖一个口来通些气就好了。
    这样做的烟堆比单用麦秸等做的上面没有覆土的要好。用这种烟堆的形式熏烟，既能发出浓烟，又不容易着火使烟堆很快燃完，燃烧后的灰堆还可成为很好的肥料。
    2、包扎法——用纸、草等物包扎植物，也能防止植物受到冻害。但这种方法费工费料，只能在小范围（如果园）内用于较贵重的植物，难于大规模地应用。
    此外，在霜冻来临之前，先在田地里浇一些水也是可以预防霜冻的。但这种方法经实验是不宜于预防初霜冻的。
      四、预防霜冻的几个问题
    1、用绳拉或用扫帚扫的办法是决不能用的。有很多地方曾应用这种方法，但小麦所受损害更重。这是因为发生霜冻后，麦秆、麦叶都冻硬了，一拉就会把小麦拉伤，太阳出来后便渐渐枯干了。
    2、用熏烟法时，熏烟时间决不可过早或过晚。有的地方，一听说夜间有霜，在傍晚时就点火熏烟了，也有的地方直到出现白霜后才点烟堆，而且点着后就不管了，这样就都不能起到应有的作用。熏烟应在相当于叶面高度上的空气温度在一度到二度时开始，熏烟过早对人力、物力都不经济，过晚则防霜冻的效果就会减小，甚至无效。
    3、要正确而及时地掌握温度情况。在可能发生霜冻的夜间，各地为了了解温度情况，掌握熏烟开始时间，有的把湿手巾挂起来，等手巾结冰后开始熏烟；有的把温度表挂在树上；有的把温度表放在口袋内，隔一定时间拿出来看看；有的把温度表挂在室内观测；有的观测温度表所费时间很长，并对着温度表呼吸等，这些都是不合适的。把湿手巾挂起来，因为它的高度没有一定，温度却因高度不同而有所不同，并且湿手巾在低于零下数度时才开始结冰的情况也是有的，因此用湿手巾来确定熏烟开始时间是不好的。温度表挂在树上、放在口袋内或室内，它所表示的温度都不能代表田间的温度，应把温度表放在麦田里，并且不宜太靠近地边，要安置在小麦的叶面同高度处，用小竹杆或木棍子架好，使球部不接触麦叶。观测温度表要快，并且要屏住呼吸。
    有些农村可能还没有温度表，可以在田地的较低洼的地方，放置一个大斧或其他黑色没有生锈的铁器。如有霜时，它在斧上或铁器上凝固的时间，一般要早于地面作物凝霜约一小时。因此一旦发现斧上或其他铁器上有霜，而天空只有小风、淡云且无大变化的情况时，立即点火熏烟，很为适时。有时也可能斧上无霜而仍有霜冻，但这种情况是很少的。
