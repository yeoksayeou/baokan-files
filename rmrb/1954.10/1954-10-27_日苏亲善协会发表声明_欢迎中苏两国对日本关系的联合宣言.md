Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japan-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement on October 14th regarding the joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments.

The statement believes that this joint declaration has epoch-making significance for international relations in the Far East. The joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments on relations with Japan should be given special attention.

The statement said: This joint declaration points out frankly and clearly the causes of the suffering of the Japanese people today, and points out how the Japanese people should defend their own interests. This joint declaration also proves once again the warm sympathy and strong trust of the leaders of the two governments for the Japanese people.

The statement said: Comparing the current situation of Japan with the Japanese people's own experiences, it can be seen that the China-Soviet policy towards Japan is in line with the Japanese people's own interests, because the Yoshida government's policy of leaning towards the United States has trampled on the Japanese people's hope for peace and independence and ignored the interests of the Japanese people.

The statement concluded: The Japan-Soviet Friendship Association has been working hard for cultural exchange, economic cooperation and friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. This effort should be further strengthened to adapt to the current domestic and international situation. At the same time, it is deeply felt that the time has come for the Japanese people to work for the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: According to TASS, Montevideo, October 24th: The Brazilian weekly "Workers' Voice" published an editorial commenting on the significance of the China-Soviet talks communique.

The newspaper wrote: "Just as the irreconcilable contradictions between the imperialist countries are developing and deepening, and eroding their infamous 'unity', the countries of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp are increasingly strengthening their fraternal ties."

"Workers' Voice" emphasized that the China-Soviet talks communique has world significance. It said: "The joint declaration outlining the foreign policies of the two countries aims at defending the cause of world peace and the independence of all peoples. This declaration not only reflects the views of the Chinese and Soviet governments, but also reflects the views of all peace-loving people. It is a program of action for all oppressed peoples in Asia."

The newspaper continued to point out that the joint declaration proves the increasing prestige of the People's Republic of China. Its peace-loving principles are completely opposite to the actions of the American imperialists in piecing together aggressive blocs in Europe and Asia.

    日苏亲善协会发表声明
    欢迎中苏两国对日本关系的联合宣言
      巴西“工人呼声报”指出中苏会谈公报具有世界意义
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：日苏亲善协会在十月十四日就中、苏两国政府联合宣言发表了声明。
    声明认为：这一联合宣言对远东的国际关系有着划时代的重要性。中苏两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言，更应特别加以重视。
    声明说：这一联合宣言率直而又明了地指出了造成今日日本人民的痛苦的原因是什么，并且指出了日本人民应该如何来保卫自己的利益。这一联合宣言也再次证明了两国政府领袖对日本人民温暖的同情和强烈的信任。
    声明说：把日本目前的状况和日本人民自身的体验作一对照，就可以知道中苏两国的对日政策是符合日本人民自身的利益的，因为吉田政府所采取的倒向美国的政策，践踏了日本人民要求和平、独立的希望，并忽视日本人民的利益。
    声明最后说：日苏亲善协会一直为日苏两国的文化交流、经济合作和友好亲善而努力，这一努力更应适应目前国内外的形势作进一步的加强，同时也深深感到日本人民为恢复和中、苏两国的邦交而努力的时间，已经来到了。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚二十四日讯：巴西周报“工人呼声报”发表社论，评论中苏两国会谈公报的意义。
    这家报纸写道：“正当帝国主义各国之间无法解决的矛盾日益发展和加深，并侵蚀着他们的声名狼藉的‘团结’的时候，民主和反帝国主义阵营各国正越来越加强他们之间的兄弟联系。”
    “工人呼声报”着重指出，中苏两国的会谈公报具有世界的意义。它说：“表明两国外交政策的联合宣言，旨在保卫世界和平事业和各国人民的独立。这一宣言不但反映了中苏两国政府的观点，而且也反映了所有爱好和平人民的观点。它是亚洲所有被压迫人民的行动纲领。”
    这家报纸继续指出，联合宣言证明了中华人民共和国威望的提高。它的爱好和平的原则是和美帝国主义者在欧洲和亚洲拼凑侵略集团的行动完全相反的。
