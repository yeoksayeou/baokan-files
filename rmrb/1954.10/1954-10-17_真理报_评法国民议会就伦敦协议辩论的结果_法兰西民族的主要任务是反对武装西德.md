Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 14th: The "People's Daily" published an article by G. Radiani entitled "A Dangerous Road." This article comments on the outcome of the French National Assembly's debate on the London Agreement.

Radiani pointed out that the hastily prepared London Plan was designed to prevent the situation after the collapse of the "European Defense Community" plan from being used to strengthen peace and security, and to re-escalate international tensions. The purpose of the London resolution is to revive German militarism in order to create a threat of war in Europe, to extend the occupation of West Germany indefinitely, to hinder the unification of Germany, and to drag West Germany into an aggressive bloc composed of several Western European countries, making this bloc confront other European countries.

Radiani emphasized that it is noteworthy that, during the National Assembly debate, supporters of the London Plan did not even dare to insist that the plan was in France's interests. Their main argument was the repeatedly raised theory, which was constantly regurgitated during the discussion of the Paris Treaty, that the re-militarization of West Germany was "inevitable" and a "lesser evil."

Radiani said: From all the speeches in the National Assembly, it is clear that the main question that worries French public opinion today is: What can promote and what can hinder the achievement of a unified decision to consolidate European security?

After analyzing the French National Assembly's debate in detail, Radiani said: Today, more and more people in France realize that the rejection of the Paris Treaty due to the unremitting efforts of all patriotic forces of the French nation is only the first stage in the struggle to defend French security. The fact that the forces that took joint action in parliament against the "European Defense Community" cannot take joint action against this new plan to arm West Germany, which is equally dangerous to France, at this stage – this fact only emphasizes the importance of continuing to fight against the implementation of this plan. The result of the National Assembly vote once again proves how dangerous the wavering of those who opposed the revival of the Hitler Wehrmacht yesterday but are now happy to agree to the establishment of the "Western European Union" – the essence of which is the same: to re-militarize West Germany – is to France.

Radiani concluded: The struggle against the London Plan to rebuild German militarism, and against dragging France into a military bloc with Bonn revanchists, has become the main task of all sober-minded people of the French nation. French patriots demand that French rulers pursue a policy that should not be one of supporting an aggressive plan to prepare for another war in Europe, but one of uniting the forces of all Asian countries to solve major international problems such as the German question, ensuring pan-European security, disarmament and the atomic issue. This policy is in line with the interests of the French nation.

### “真理报”评法国民议会就伦敦协议辩论的结果  法兰西民族的主要任务是反对武装西德

    “真理报”评法国民议会就伦敦协议辩论的结果
    法兰西民族的主要任务是反对武装西德
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：“真理报”刊载了格·拉季阿尼写的一篇文章，题目是“危险的道路”。这篇文章评论的是法国国民议会就伦敦协议举行辩论的结果。
    拉季阿尼指出，匆匆准备的伦敦计划是为了使得在“欧洲防务集团”计划破产以后的局势不能被利用来加强和平与安全，伦敦计划是为了要再度加剧国际紧张局势。伦敦决议书的目的是：复活德国军国主义以便在欧洲制造战争威胁；无限期地延长对西德的占领；阻挠德国的统一并把西德拖入几个西欧国家组成的侵略集团，使这个集团与其他欧洲国家相对立。
    拉季阿尼强调说，值得注意的是，在国民议会辩论期间，伦敦计划的支持者们甚至不敢硬说这个计划是符合法国的利益的。他们的主要论据就是在讨论巴黎条约时喋喋不休地屡次提出的所谓西德的重新军国主义化是“不可避免”的和“祸害较轻”的理论。
    拉季阿尼说：从国民议会的所有的发言中可以清楚地看出，今天使法国舆论感到不安的主要问题就是：什么能够促进、什么能够阻挠获致巩固欧洲安全的一致的决定？
    拉季阿尼在详细分析了法国国民议会的辩论后说：今天法国国内越来越多的人认识到，巴黎条约由于法兰西民族的所有爱国力量坚持不懈的努力而遭到拒绝，这仅仅是保卫法国安全的斗争中的第一个阶段。曾在议会中采取联合行动反对“欧洲防务集团”的力量，在现阶段不能像过去一样采取联合行动来反对这个对法国同样危险的武装西德的新计划——这个事实仅仅着重说明了为反对这个计划的实施而继续斗争的重要性。国民议会投票的结果再一次证明，那些昨天还在反对“欧洲军”而今天却欣然同意建立“西欧联盟”——这个联盟的本质是同样的：使西德重新军国主义化——的反对复活希特勒国防军的人们的动摇，对于法国是多么危险。
    拉季阿尼最后写道：反对重建德国军国主义的伦敦计划、反对把法国拖入一个有波恩复仇主义者参加的军事集团的斗争，已经成为法兰西民族所有头脑清醒的人们当前的主要任务了。法国的爱国者要求法国统治者奉行的政策不应该是一种支持在欧洲准备另一次战争的侵略计划的政策，而应该是一种联合所有亚洲国家的力量来解决类如德国问题、保障全欧安全、裁减军备和原子问题等这些主要国际问题的政策。这个政策才是符合法国民族利益的。
