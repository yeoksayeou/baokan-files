Comrade Deputy Prime Minister, Comrade Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

Today is the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the first peaceful and democratic state in German history. With great pleasure, I represent the government and people of the People's Republic of China in extending warm congratulations to Comrade Deputy Prime Minister and Comrade Ambassador, and through you, to the government and all the people of the German Democratic Republic.

Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party and President Pieck, and with the sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union, the people of the German Democratic Republic have shattered the conspiracies and sabotage of reactionary forces at home and abroad, consolidated the people's democratic system, and restored and developed the national economy. Now, with unparalleled labor enthusiasm, they are confidently carrying out the first five-year construction plan, striving to achieve even more brilliant achievements in improving the material and cultural life of the people. The Chinese people regard every achievement made by the people of the German Democratic Republic in their construction endeavors as their own, and feel boundless joy.

The vital issue for the German people is to restore Germany's unity on the basis of peace and democracy, conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and withdraw all occupying forces, so that the German people can forever escape the path of war and disaster and embark on the path of peaceful development. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the German Democratic Republic have made unremitting efforts to resolve the vital issues of the German nation. This effort by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the German Democratic Republic has united all democratic and patriotic forces among the German people, and has received the full support of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, especially the Soviet people. However, the Western countries, headed by the United States, have consistently obstructed the unification of Germany, revived German militarism, and threatened peace and security in Europe and the world. After the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty suffered a disgraceful defeat, the Western countries hastily decided at the London Nine-Power Conference, according to the US plan, to rearm West Germany and drag West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Obviously, the inevitable consequence of this plan is to deepen Germany's current division, turn West Germany into a hotbed of new war, and pose a serious threat to the peace and security of European countries. There is no doubt that this plan, which violates the interests of the German people and endangers peace in Europe and the world, will be resolutely opposed by the peace-loving German people and the people of the world. The German people's struggle for national unification and to safeguard peace and security in Europe is a just cause. A just cause cannot be broken by any reactionary force.

The mutual concern and support between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic in the cause of peace has been embodied in the joint communiqué issued by the Prime Ministers of our two countries on July 25 this year. The fraternal friendship between our two countries is also constantly strengthening with the increasingly close economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries. It should be especially mentioned that the German Democratic Republic has provided material and technical assistance to our country's economic construction. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic.

Dear Comrades, Friends, on this significant holiday, let us
    raise our glasses to the fraternal friendship between the people's of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic, to the prosperity of the German Democratic Republic, to the health of the respected President Wilhelm Pieck, to the establishment of a unified, peaceful, democratic and independent Germany, and to lasting peace and security in Europe and the world!

### 周恩来总理在招待会上的讲话

    周恩来总理在招待会上的讲话副总理同志、大使同志、同志们、朋友们：
    今天是德国历史上第一个和平民主的国家——德意志民主共和国成立的五周年纪念日。我以极愉快的心情代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向副总理同志和大使同志，并通过你们向德意志民主共和国政府和全德意志人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    五年来，德意志民主共和国的人民，在统一社会党和皮克总统的领导下，在伟大苏联的真诚援助下，粉碎了国内外反动派的阴谋破坏，巩固了人民民主制度，恢复和发展了国民经济。现在，他们正以无比的劳动热情，满怀信心地进行着第一个五年建设计划，争取在提高人民的物质和文化生活方面获得更加辉煌的成就。中国人民把德意志民主共和国人民在建设事业中所取得的每一项成就，都看成是自己的成就一样，感到无限的欢欣。
    德意志人民的切身问题是在和平民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，缔结对德和约和撤退一切占领军，使德国人民永远脱离战争灾难的道路，而走上和平发展的道路。德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国为了争取解决德意志民族的切身问题，作了不懈的努力。德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国的这种努力，团结了德意志人民中的一切民主爱国力量，并且得到了世界上爱好和平的国家和人民，首先是苏联人民的全力支持。但是以美国为首的西方国家却一贯地阻挠德国的统一，复活德国的军国主义，以威胁欧洲和世界的和平和安全。在所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约刚刚遭到可耻的失败之后，西方国家又匆忙地在伦敦九国会议上，按照美国的计划，决定重新武装西德并把西德拖进北大西洋侵略集团。显然，这种计划的必然后果就是加深德国现在的分裂，把西德变为新战争的温床，并且使欧洲各国的和平和安全受到严重的威胁。毫无疑问，这种违背德意志人民的利益、危害欧洲和世界和平的计划，一定会遭到爱好和平的德意志人民和全世界人民的坚决反对。德意志人民争取国家统一、保障欧洲的和平和安全的斗争，是正义的事业。正义的事业是任何反动势力所攻不破的。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国在和平事业中的互相关怀和支持，已经由我们两国的总理在今年七月二十五日发表的会谈公报中体现出来。我们两国之间的兄弟友谊也随着我们两国在经济上、文化上日益密切的合作而不断地加强。特别应该提到的是德意志民主共和国对我国的经济建设所给予的物质和技术援助。我愿借此机会向德意志民主共和国政府和人民表示感谢。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，在这个具有重要意义的节日，让我们
    为中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国两国人民的兄弟友谊，为德意志民主共和国的繁荣和发展，为敬爱的威廉·皮克总统的健康，为建立一个统一、和平、民主、独立的德国，为欧洲和世界的持久和平和安全而干杯！
