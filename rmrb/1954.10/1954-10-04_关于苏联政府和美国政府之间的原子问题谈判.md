The newspapers have already reported that the Soviet government, which consistently pursues a policy of peace, has expressed its willingness to participate in secret or diplomatic negotiations on the proposal made by President Eisenhower on December 8, 1953, regarding the international use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. In its response on December 21, 1953, the Soviet government stated that it proceeds from the premise that during the negotiations, the following proposals by the Soviet Union will also be reviewed:

"The participating countries, with the desire to ease international tensions, will undertake the sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. If an international agreement is reached on this issue, it will be an important step towards the complete elimination of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction from national armaments, and towards the establishment of strict international supervision to ensure that the agreement to prohibit the use of atomic energy for military purposes is observed."

In the subsequent negotiations between the Soviet government and the U.S. government, corresponding documents were exchanged.

On September 22, the Soviet government proposed to the U.S. government that all documents related to these negotiations be published separately in Soviet and American newspapers, so that public opinion could be informed about these negotiations. The Soviet government pointed out that the publication of all diplomatic documents related to the negotiations was necessary because newspapers had published reports that distorted the positions of both sides.

On September 23, the U.S. government agreed to the Soviet government's proposal.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry hereby publishes all the documents exchanged between the Soviet government and the U.S. government during the negotiations on the atomic issue.

The full texts of the documents are as follows:

Document 1: Memorandum from U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Georgii N. Zarubin, January 11, 1954, in Washington (translated from Russian)

1. The U.S. proposes that negotiations on atomic energy should initially be conducted through diplomatic channels, with each party retaining the right to transfer the negotiations to the United Nations for secret talks under the supervision of the Disarmament Commission, as decided by the United Nations.

2. It is proposed that diplomatic negotiations be held in Washington or any other place convenient for the participating parties. It is expected that Mr. Molotov and Mr. Dulles will hold a secret discussion in Berlin.

3. It is proposed that negotiations on procedural issues be initially limited to the Soviet Union and the U.S., and that other major interested countries be invited to participate as appropriate, depending on the nature of the issues discussed.

4. The U.S. is prepared to consider any proposals by the Soviet Union regarding atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction that it deems appropriate.

5. However, the U.S. believes that initial efforts should be made on an appropriate basis to generate the necessary trust and confidence for broader planning. Therefore, the U.S. requests that discussions on President Eisenhower's proposal of December 8, 1953, begin as soon as possible. The U.S. is prepared to start specific secret negotiations on this plan and its implementation.

6. The U.S. believes that maintaining secrecy is currently the most likely way to promote concrete results, and that neither party should use these negotiations for propaganda purposes.

Document 2: Memorandum from Georgii N. Zarubin to Mr. John Foster Dulles, January 19, in Washington

Regarding the memorandum from Mr. Dulles, the U.S. Secretary of State, to Ambassador Georgii N. Zarubin on January 11, the Soviet government deems it necessary to make the following statement:

1. The first point of the U.S. memorandum states: "The U.S. proposes that negotiations on atomic energy be initially conducted through diplomatic channels, with each party retaining the right to transfer the negotiations to the United Nations for secret talks under the supervision of the Disarmament Commission, as decided by the United Nations."

There are no objections to this point.

2. The second point of the U.S. memorandum states: "It is proposed that diplomatic negotiations be held in Washington or any other place convenient for the participating parties. It is expected that Mr. Molotov and Mr. Dulles will hold a secret discussion in Berlin."

There are no objections to this point.

3. The third point of the U.S. memorandum states: "It is proposed that negotiations on procedural issues be initially limited to the Soviet Union and the U.S., and that other major interested countries be invited to participate as appropriate, depending on the nature of the issues discussed."

The Soviet government agrees with the considerations presented in the third point of the memorandum because, at a certain stage of the negotiations, it is necessary to consider inviting all countries that bear the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and international security to participate in the negotiations.

4. The fourth point of the U.S. memorandum states: "The U.S. is prepared to consider any proposals by the Soviet Union regarding atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction that it deems appropriate."

In this regard, it is necessary to reiterate the statement made by the Soviet government on December 21, 1953, which pointed out that the Soviet government proceeds from the premise that during the negotiations, the following proposals by the Soviet government will also be reviewed: the participating countries will undertake the sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

5. The fifth point of the U.S. memorandum states: "However, the U.S. believes that initial efforts should be made on an appropriate basis to generate the necessary trust and confidence for broader planning. Therefore, the U.S. requests that discussions on President Eisenhower's proposal of December 8, 1953, begin as soon as possible. The U.S. is prepared to start specific secret negotiations on this plan and its implementation."

The Soviet government agrees to begin reviewing President Eisenhower's proposal of December 8, 1953, and also agrees to begin negotiations on this proposal as mentioned above. The Soviet government also believes it is necessary to reach an understanding that during the discussion of the U.S. proposal and the Soviet proposal mentioned in the fourth point, the principle of alternation should be followed: one meeting discusses the U.S. proposal, and the next meeting discusses the Soviet proposal.

6. The sixth point of the U.S. memorandum states: "The U.S. believes that maintaining secrecy is currently the most likely way to promote concrete results, and that neither party should use these negotiations for propaganda purposes."

There are no objections to this point.

Document 3: Draft Declaration on the Unconditional Non-Use of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction by the Governments of the U.S., the U.K., France, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, handed over by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov to Mr. John Foster Dulles on January 30 in Berlin

The Governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,

Determined to save humanity from the threat of destructive wars using atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, or other weapons of mass destruction,

Seeking to promote the use of the great scientific discoveries in the field of atomic energy solely for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of the peoples of all countries, and for the improvement of their living conditions,

Considering that the unconditional non-use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction by all countries is in line with the fundamental purposes of the United Nations and will be an important step towards the complete elimination of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction from national armaments, and towards the establishment of strict international supervision to ensure that the agreement to prohibit the use of atomic energy for military purposes is observed,

In accordance with the wishes of the peoples of all countries to ease international tensions,

Solemnly declare: They undertake the unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction;

Call upon all other countries to join this declaration.

Document 4: Memorandum from Vyacheslav M. Molotov to Mr. John Foster Dulles, February 13, in Berlin

1. The Soviet government, in the memorandum handed over by the Soviet Ambassador to Washington to the U.S. Secretary of State on January 19, 1954, expressed the opinion that in the later stages of the negotiations on the atomic issue, all countries that bear the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and international security should be invited to participate.

Vyacheslav M. Molotov, in a private meeting with Mr. Dulles on January 30 of this year, explained that the countries referred to are five: the U.S., the Soviet Union, the U.K., France, and the People's Republic of China.

2. Mr. Dulles, in this meeting, expressed the opinion that the U.K., France, as well as Canada and Belgium, should be invited to participate in the negotiations on the atomic issue, and he explained that Canada and Belgium should participate in the negotiations as countries with atomic raw material resources.

3. Regarding this, the Soviet government stated that it does not object to the negotiations on the atomic issue, at an appropriate stage, inviting Canada and Belgium to participate in addition to the five countries. The Soviet government also believes it is necessary to invite Czechoslovakia as a country with atomic raw material resources to participate in the aforementioned negotiations.

Document 5: Letter from Mr. John Foster Dulles to Mr. Vyacheslav M. Molotov, February 16, handed over in Berlin: Personal—Confidential

Dear Minister,

I am responding to your memorandum of February 13, 1954, regarding the discussion on the atomic proposal.

In the second paragraph, marked with a number, you state that I "expressed the opinion that the U.K., France, as well as Canada and Belgium, should be invited to participate in the negotiations on the atomic issue, (and) explained that Canada and Belgium should participate in the negotiations as countries with atomic raw material resources." This statement does not completely match my recollection of the opinion I expressed on January 30 regarding this issue. I hope to clarify this apparent misunderstanding. In that discussion, I said that the U.K., Canada, and France had made progress in the field of atomic energy. I then mentioned the important producing countries of this raw material, Belgium, and other countries. In this context, I expressed that if we were to move our talks from a bilateral basis to a broader conference, at that stage, the U.S. would raise the question of which countries should participate in the conference.

Regarding the general question of possible future participants, I would like to draw your attention once again to the general statements I have made here (in Berlin) more than once. This is: the U.S. is not prepared to participate in a conference based on the special responsibility of the Communist government of China for maintaining international peace and security.

I hope that after my return to Washington, I can immediately hand over a memorandum to Ambassador Zarubin in Washington regarding the content of the U.S. President's proposal.

Sincerely,
John Foster Dulles (signed)

Document 6: Letter from Vyacheslav M. Molotov to Mr. John Foster Dulles, February 18, handed over in Berlin

I have received your letter of February 16, 1954.

Since you are preparing to leave here today, I will hand over my response to your letter through the Soviet Ambassador to Washington, Zarubin.

Respectfully,
Vyacheslav Molotov (signed)

Document 7: Memorandum from Vyacheslav M. Molotov to Acting U.S. Secretary of State Walter B. Smith, handed over by Georgii N. Zarubin on March 10 in Washington

Regarding the letter from the U.S. Secretary of State to the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov dated February 16 of this year, I, by order of Vyacheslav M. Molotov, make the following statement:

The reasons mentioned in this letter for not specifying which specific countries should be invited to participate in the negotiations on the atomic issue in the later stages have been considered.

As mentioned earlier by Ambassador Zarubin in his memorandum to Mr. Dulles on January 19 and in the private meeting between Vyacheslav M. Molotov and Mr. Dulles in Berlin, the Soviet government agrees to negotiate the atomic issue with the U.S. government on a bilateral basis. At the same time, if it is decided to transfer the negotiations to a broader conference, there is no objection to re-examining the membership of such a conference.

Regarding the possible participation of the People's Republic of China in the later stages of the negotiations on the atomic issue, the Soviet government's opinion on this matter has been presented in the memorandum of February 13.

Document 8: Memorandum from Mr. John Foster Dulles to Georgii N. Zarubin, March 19, in Washington

The U.S. government wishes to present some preliminary views to clarify the proposal made by the U.S. President to the United Nations General Assembly on December 8, 1953, regarding the establishment of an international atomic energy agency:

I. Purpose of the U.S. Proposal

The U.S. proposes the establishment of an international atomic energy agency under the auspices of the United Nations to accept nuclear materials from member countries that have such inventories, for the following purposes:

1. To ensure that engineers and scientists around the world have sufficient materials for research and development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and to encourage the exchange of information through appropriate methods and incentives.

2. To supply nuclear materials to meet the needs of agriculture, medicine, and other peaceful activities, including the final production of power.

II. International Atomic Energy Agency

1. This agency will be established and empowered according to the terms of a treaty concluded by the participating countries. The treaty should, as far as possible, specify the standards and principles that the agency should follow in the performance of its duties.

2. Membership—All signatory countries will become members of this agency.

3. Management

a. The highest executive authority of this agency should be exercised by a council composed of a limited number of members representing the governments of various countries. In determining the composition of the council, it is best to consider the geographical distribution of future beneficiary countries and whether they are member countries. It is hoped that the main donor countries will all participate in the council.

b. It is proposed that the council generally adopt some form of majority voting when making decisions. Arrangements can be made to give the main donor countries special voting rights on certain issues, such as the distribution of fissile materials.

4. Staff—The staff of this agency should be led by an administrative head or manager, who is appointed by the council for a fixed term and supervised by the council. The staff, of course, includes highly competent scientific and technical personnel. The administrative head should be responsible for the appointment, organization, and operation of the staff under the overall supervision of the council.

5. Funds

a. The central equipment and fixed factories of this agency, as well as the funds for its research work plan, should be paid for by the participating countries according to a unanimously agreed contribution ratio. It is proposed that the general principles for determining the contribution ratios of the member countries of the United Nations can be applied.

b. The funds for special plans proposed by member countries to use the materials or services of this agency should be provided by the beneficiary countries in each case through special arrangements.

6. The administrative headquarters of this agency can be located in a place agreed upon by all parties.

7. Relations with the United Nations and other international organizations—This agency should report to the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly if either of these bodies requests it to do so. This agency should also consult and cooperate with other United Nations bodies whose work may be related to its work.

8. The equipment of this agency will include:

a. Factories, equipment, and facilities for receiving, storing, and distributing nuclear materials.

b. Physical protection.

c. Supervisory laboratories for analysis and inspection of the reception and storage of nuclear materials.

d. Houses for the administrative activities of this agency and other activities not included in the previous items.

e. Equipment that may be needed at any time, such as education and training, research and development, fuel production, and chemical processing.

III. Powers of the Agency

1. Reception and Storage of Materials

a. All countries that have normal and enhanced inventories of uranium, thorium metals, uranium-233, uranium-235, uranium-238, plutonium, and the aforementioned mixtures of materials will contribute these materials to this agency.

b. The U.S. is prepared to initially contribute a large amount of nuclear materials to meet the needs of this agency as a donation. The Soviet Union will make a similar donation to meet this need.

c. This agency will specifically determine the location and method of delivering the materials and, at an appropriate time, determine the form and composition of the materials it will receive. This agency will also inspect the designated quantity of received materials and report these figures to the participating countries. This agency will be responsible for storing and protecting these materials to minimize the possibility of sudden theft.

2. Distribution of Materials by the Agency

a. This agency will consider the requests of the participating countries for the storage of materials to be distributed according to uniform and fair standards. These standards include:

(1) The purpose of the materials—including scientific and technical possibilities.

(2) Whether the plans, funds, technical personnel, and other necessary conditions for the effective use of the materials are sufficient.

(3) Whether the proposed measures for handling and storing materials and using equipment are sufficient in terms of health and safety.

(4) Fair distribution of the available materials.

b. The ownership of nuclear materials will initially be retained by this agency, which will determine the fair price to be paid for the use of the materials.

c. To ensure that adequate health and safety standards are observed and that the distributed fissile materials are used for the purposes specified at the time of distribution, this agency will continue to have the right to specify certain design and management conditions—health and safety rules, require the submission of work reports and records, specify the handling of by-products and waste of fissile materials, maintain the right to supervision, and require the submission of progress reports.

This agency will also have the right to inspect the condition of the distributed material inventory and verify that it complies with the terms of issue.

d. Information on all activities carried out by this agency will be communicated to the member countries.

3. Information and Service Activities of the Agency

a. All member countries will have information about the activities of this agency, which will enable them to make contributions to this agency.

b. In addition to the materials obtained from its own activities, this agency will also have:

(1) Materials obtained by the participating countries after using the materials, information, services, and other assistance provided by this agency.

(2) Materials that can be publicly obtained in some countries.

(3) Materials obtained by the main member countries or other member countries and voluntarily contributed to this agency.

c. This agency will encourage the exchange of international scientific and technical information and be responsible for the wide dissemination of the materials it possesses.

d. This agency will act as a medium for one participating country to serve another participating country. The specific activities that this agency may provide include:

(1) Training and education.

(2) Services for formulating public health and safety rules for the use of fissile materials.

(3) Technical advisory services related to the formulation and implementation of plans.

(4) Processing of nuclear materials (e.g., chemical analysis and purification, fuel element production, etc.).

(5) Supply of special materials such as heavy water.

(6) Design and supply of special equipment.

(7) Special experimental services such as conducting experiments and tests.

(8) Assistance in making financial arrangements to support appropriate plans.

Document 9: Memorandum from Vyacheslav M. Molotov to Mr. John Foster Dulles, handed over on April 27 in Geneva

In his speech on December 8, 1953, President Eisenhower discussed the issue of the international atomic energy agency. The memorandum from the U.S. government on March 19 of this year provides more details about this international atomic energy agency. In response to the U.S. government's memorandum, the Soviet government deems it necessary to present the following considerations.

In the aforementioned speech, President Eisenhower emphasized the special danger of atomic weapons and proposed that the relevant countries contribute a small part of their atomic material inventories to this international agency for peaceful purposes. The memorandum of March 19 discusses some details of the organization of the aforementioned agency but completely ignores the opinions expressed by the Soviet government in its statement of December 21 regarding President Eisenhower's speech of December 8. The purpose of the Soviet government in expressing these opinions is to reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and to ensure that countries in the near future are responsible for guaranteeing the non-use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, which are essentially weapons of aggression.

In his speech of December 8, President Eisenhower said: "Our country hopes for construction, not destruction. It hopes for international agreements, not international wars." In this speech, President Eisenhower also said: "The United States has noted this proposal by the United Nations General Assembly and is immediately prepared to hold secret talks with those 'principal interested' countries to 'seek' an 'acceptable solution' to the problem of the atomic arms race, because the shadow of the atomic arms race not only hangs over peace but also over the survival of the world."

President Eisenhower's words express the desire for peace and the desire to jointly seek a solution to the problem of the atomic arms race with representatives of other countries, and the desire to reach "international agreements, not international wars." The Soviet government has always sincerely wanted to strengthen international peace, and in the current situation, especially to promote the elimination of the threat of atomic war, therefore, the Soviet government expresses its readiness to participate in the corresponding negotiations at any time.

In doing so, the Soviet government has considered it necessary, and still considers it necessary, to draw special attention to the following facts:

1. The U.S. proposal for countries to contribute a small part of their atomic material inventories to the international agency for peaceful purposes cannot promote the achievement of the purposes proposed by President Eisenhower in the aforementioned speech. When a small part of the atomic materials is used for peaceful purposes, the majority of the atomic materials will still be used to manufacture new atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, which means continuing to stockpile atomic weapons in large quantities and possibly developing new types of such weapons with greater destructive power. Such a situation means that countries capable of manufacturing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons can freely continue to increase their stockpiles of these weapons.

To take a small part of the atomic materials from the existing inventories for peaceful purposes, it seems that only the quantity of atomic materials used to manufacture atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs will be gradually reduced. However, in reality, the situation will not be like this. In some countries, the production of atomic materials increases very rapidly every year, so even if a certain part is taken for peaceful purposes, it will not reduce the number of newly manufactured atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. Therefore, even if the U.S. proposal is implemented, it cannot be said that the atomic arms race will stop—as President Eisenhower said in his speech of December 8. Due to the current high level of scientific and technological achievements, it is possible to increase the production of atomic weapons by using the peaceful applications of atomic energy.

It is known that in practice, it is possible to produce electricity for peaceful purposes on an industrial scale by using atomic materials, and the quantity of fissile atomic materials used in such production not only does not decrease but actually increases. Moreover, non-dangerous atomic materials will be transformed into explosive fissile substances, and these substances are the basis for manufacturing atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs. In other words, in practice, it is indisputable that the peaceful application of atomic energy and the simultaneous production of atomic materials for manufacturing atomic weapons are inseparable. Such a situation not only does not reduce the quantity of atomic materials used to manufacture atomic weapons but will also promote the unlimited increase of such stockpiles due to the increasing production of these materials in various countries and by the international agency itself.

Therefore, the U.S. proposal to use a part of the atomic materials for peaceful purposes not only cannot stop the atomic arms race but will lead to further intensification of this race.

2. The U.S. proposal of December 8 and the U.S. memorandum of March 19 both completely ignore the fact that it is unacceptable to use atomic weapons, which are weapons of mass destruction.

Adopting President Eisenhower's proposal will not limit the use of atomic weapons for any purpose at any time, and therefore, it will not reduce the danger of wars using atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

Currently, countries that possess atomic materials and the appropriate industrial and technological equipment for manufacturing atomic weapons are manufacturing and stockpiling atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs on an increasingly large scale, and these weapons have increasingly greater destructive power. In this situation, even if the aforementioned U.S. proposal is adopted, it will not change the current situation. Moreover, all of this is done in the absence of any international agreement that limits the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons by any country.

However, it is undeniable that due to the increasingly greater destructive power of atomic weapons, especially the appearance of hydrogen bombs, there is now widespread unease in many countries. If these well-known facts and the increasingly urgent need to prevent the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons in war are ignored, it is a mistake.

From all of the above, it can be concluded that neither the U.S. proposal of December 8 nor the U.S. memorandum of March 19 is in line with the main purpose—eliminating the threat of atomic war.

The Soviet government, in its statement of December 21, pointed out that if the U.S. government, like the Soviet government, sincerely desires to ease international tensions and strengthen peace, then the two governments should strive to reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and on the implementation of effective international supervision of this prohibition.

Such an international prohibition of the use of atomic weapons will open up broad opportunities for the peaceful application of atomic energy. Due to President Eisenhower's speech of December 8 and the U.S. memorandum of March 19 ignoring the prohibition of atomic weapons and, in fact, allowing the production of these weapons to continue to increase without limit, making it possible for aggressors to use these weapons, the U.S. proposal to establish an international atomic energy agency does not reduce the danger of atomic war in the slightest. Moreover, it may serve the opposite purpose. This proposal to use a part of the atomic materials for peaceful purposes may create the deceptive impression that the quantity of atomic weapons being manufactured has been reduced, thereby making the peoples of the countries less vigilant about the increasingly serious danger of wars using these weapons of mass destruction.

So far, it has not been possible to reach a corresponding agreement on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, but this fact not only has not reduced the significance of efforts in this regard but, on the contrary, makes such efforts even more necessary, because the ever-increasing arms race of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons is an ever-increasing threat to the peoples of all countries. This is especially true for those countries that possess considerable atomic material resources and are currently manufacturing

Title: On the Question of the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons
Author:

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 26th.

    If the question of prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons is narrowed down to merely an agreement between countries to use a small portion of atomic materials for peaceful purposes without limiting the future production of atomic weapons, such an international agreement would in fact be permitting the manufacture of atomic weapons. This would only be beneficial to aggressive forces and is absolutely unacceptable. Such an international approval of the manufacture of atomic weapons would not only fail to promote an agreement to prohibit atomic weapons but would also create new obstacles to the achievement of such an agreement.

    It is necessary not to use a small portion of atomic materials, but to apply all atomic materials entirely to peaceful purposes. It is necessary to use the achievements in this field of science not for war and the large-scale destruction of peoples, but for economic and cultural development, to provide unprecedented opportunities to develop industry, agriculture, and transportation, to apply in medicine, to continuously improve technology, and to further advance science.

    The prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the use of all atomic materials for peaceful purposes, combined with the provision of necessary aid to economically backward regions, would simultaneously promote the large-scale reduction of conventional armaments. In this way, it would be possible to greatly reduce the tax burden on the peoples of various countries, which has been increased due to the continuous expansion of armaments and the unrestrained expansion of armies by many countries.

    The Soviet government hopes to promote an agreement on the unconditional and complete prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of sufficient international supervision. Therefore, while expressing its readiness to participate in negotiations on the proposal of the U.S. government, it proposes the following suggestions for consideration:

    The countries participating in the agreement, in the spirit of easing international tensions, will undertake the solemn and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, or any other weapons of mass destruction.

    The basis for the draft declaration of the governments of the United States, Britain, France, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, proposed by the Soviet government on January 30 to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the People's Republic of China, is precisely this proposal. If the countries, especially the major powers, are responsible for ensuring the unconditional renunciation of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, it would mean a significant step forward in the direction of relieving humanity from the threat of atomic war and the immeasurable sacrifices and sufferings that come with it.

    The Soviet government notes that the U.S. government has not yet acknowledged the need for an immediate prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and appropriate international supervision of this ban, nor has it expressed a willingness to reach an agreement on the unconditional renunciation by countries of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    The Soviet government particularly attaches importance to the consistency of the positions of the Soviet Union and the United States in the solemn and unconditional responsibility of all countries not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, or any other weapons of mass destruction. Without an international agreement on the renunciation of the use of atomic weapons, the study of separate proposals to use a portion of atomic materials for civilian purposes will not help to ease international tensions and reduce the danger of war. Moreover, it could lull the peoples of the countries into complacency about the danger that lies ahead.

    In view of the above considerations, and based on President Eisenhower's speech about the desire of the United States to ease international tensions, the Soviet government believes that it is urgently necessary to first reach an understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States on the renunciation of the use of atomic weapons. Without such an understanding, the negotiations that have already begun will not produce the results that the peoples of our two countries and other countries are concerned about.

    As for the other issues mentioned in the U.S. memorandum of March 19—it is clear that this memorandum is incomplete and one-sided—these can be studied after reaching an agreement on the fundamental issues.

    Document 10: Secret Memorandum from Mr. John Foster Dulles to Mr. Vyacheslav Molotov on May 1, 1954, in Geneva

    I. I have read the memorandum of the Soviet Union of April 27 regarding the proposal of the United States of March 19 to establish an "International Atomic Energy Agency." This memorandum criticizes the U.S. proposal on the grounds that it will neither significantly reduce the stockpiles of atomic materials nor control the production or use of atomic weapons or eliminate the threat of atomic war.

    II. These criticisms misinterpret the purpose of the U.S. proposal of March 19. From the content of this proposal, it is clear that it does not aim to be a measure to control atomic weapons or solve the various other problems mentioned in the Soviet note. Its purpose is more limited, that is, to begin international cooperation in the field of atomic energy on a basis that can avoid many obstacles—these obstacles have previously always hindered the achievement of any agreement. Thus, this proposal can help to improve relations between the cooperating countries and thereby promote the solution of the more difficult problem of effectively controlling the military uses of atomic energy.

    III. Therefore, the United States cannot agree with the Soviet view that the establishment of an international agency to promote the peaceful uses of atomic substances is of no benefit in itself. On the contrary, the United States believes that such an agency can produce valuable results both in encouraging the participating countries to engage in closer cooperation and in facilitating the broader application of atomic energy for the benefit of humanity. Therefore, the United States regrets that the Soviet Union is not willing to further study this issue at this time.

    IV. In view of the Soviet Union's lack of interest in implementing this proposal at present, the United States believes that it can freely study the establishment of such an agency with other countries that may be interested. If the Soviet Union later decides to participate in any such discussions, the United States will of course welcome its participation.

    V. Of course, the U.S. proposal of March 19 is not presented as a substitute for an effective system to control the military uses of atomic energy. The United States will continue, as it has done so far, to seek ways to achieve such control under reliable and appropriate guarantees. It is prepared to continue exchanging views with the Soviet Union for this purpose and will soon convey its views on the proposals made by the Soviet Union in its memorandum of April 27.

    Document 11: Memorandum from Assistant Secretary of State Mr. Robert McChesney to Mr. Georgi N. Zarubin on July 9, 1954, in Washington

    The United States has further considered the draft declaration and memorandum submitted by the Soviet Union to the United States on January 30 and April 27, respectively. The United States wishes to offer the following observations:

    First Part

    I. President Eisenhower's speech to the United Nations General Assembly on December 8, 1953, pointed out the dangers of the atomic arms race and emphasized the United States' desire to eliminate this danger through any effective method that includes appropriate safeguards against violations and evasions. The United States would welcome any reduction in armaments that would protect the peoples of the world from the threat of war and relieve them of their heavy military defense burdens under conditions that ensure their security.

    II. At the same time, the United States has not forgotten the difficulties encountered in attempting to agree on a disarmament plan since 1946. Since then, the United States has consistently—sometimes alone, sometimes with other countries—sought ways to reduce the burden of armaments and reduce the threat of war. From 1946 to 1948 in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, from 1947 to 1950 in the Disarmament Commission, in the special meetings of the six permanent members of the Security Council in 1949 and 1950, and since 1951 in the United Nations Disarmament Commission, the overwhelming majority of countries have been able to reach an agreement, but progress has been hindered only by the obstruction of the Soviet Union.

    III. Despite this discouraging record, the President said in his December 8 speech that the United States has noted the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly of November 28, 1953, "to be prepared to hold secret talks with those other countries that may be 'primarily concerned' to 'seek' an 'acceptable solution' to the problem of the atomic arms race, because the shadow of the atomic arms race hangs not only over peace but over the survival of the world."

    Second Part

    IV. The President also said in his speech that the United States would propose a new idea in these talks, advocating the establishment of an international atomic energy agency to accelerate the realization of the use of atomic energy for the peaceful affairs of humanity. The United States explained in more detail in its memorandum of March 19 how it envisages turning this idea into a practical reality. The Soviet memorandum of April 27 seems to have completely misunderstood the purpose of this specific proposal.

    V. The purpose of this proposal is to create an opening for bringing the peaceful benefits of atomic energy to the peoples of the world. The U.S. proposal—along with other countries with atomic equipment for the common good—will provide fissionable materials and atomic energy technology. This will provide new opportunities for international cooperation. The successful results of cooperation in realizing the President's proposal will certainly improve the atmosphere, and the improvement of the atmosphere will greatly enhance the prospects for genuine and secure international disarmament.

    The proposal itself is not presented as a disarmament plan.

    VI. The Soviet memorandum of April 27 essentially says that the United States will not take cooperative steps to bring the peaceful benefits of atomic energy to the world before it agrees to prohibit the use of atomic weapons. According to the Soviet Union, the main reason for this attitude is: according to the President's proposal to the United Nations, after the establishment of the international agency, the stockpiles of materials of the weapon type can continue to increase. However, the Soviet proposal to prohibit the use of weapons can in no way prevent the increase in stockpiles. Therefore, the United States cannot consider that the Soviet attitude provides a valid reason for opposing the taking of steps at this time to promote the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    VII. The Soviet Union seems to assume that any peaceful application of atomic energy will inevitably increase the stockpiles of materials that can be used for military purposes. However, in fact, ways can be devised to prevent the diversion of materials produced by power reactors.

    At the same time, there are peaceful applications of atomic energy that will not raise the issue of materials of the weapon type.

    VIII. The United States believes that countries with the most advanced knowledge in the constructive use of atomic energy have an obligation, under appropriate conditions, to provide this knowledge to promote the general welfare of the peoples of all countries. At the present stage of nuclear science, the United States believes that it is now possible to make a start in this regard.

    Therefore, the United States believes that it can implement its proposal on its own and with other interested countries, although the Soviet Union is not currently willing to implement this proposal. If the Soviet Union later decides to participate in any such discussions, the United States will continue to welcome its participation.

    Third Part

    IX. The Soviet Union mentioned its proposal of January 30, which advocates the conclusion of an international agreement to unconditionally renounce the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other forms of weapons of mass destruction. The United States, in accordance with its repeatedly stated policy of impartially and seriously considering all proposals for disarmament, has thoroughly and seriously considered this proposal.

    X. The United States believes that any effective disarmament plan must provide satisfactory answers to the following two fundamental questions:

    A. First, does this plan truly reduce or eliminate the armaments of countries under conditions that ensure their security? A mere paper promise not to use weapons will not enable countries to reduce their armaments while maintaining security. As long as any weapons exist, there is the possibility of using them. Despite promises not to use weapons, these promises can be broken without notice.

    B. Second, does this plan significantly reduce or eliminate the threat of aggression and war? If any plan actually increases the potential aggressor's incentive to resort to war, it cannot achieve the basic purpose of disarmament.

    XI. The Soviet proposal of January 30 does not meet either of these two fundamental tests, nor does it provide any hope of producing beneficial results in disarmament:

    A. It will leave existing armaments and continued arms production completely unaffected. This can be clearly seen from the terms of the Soviet proposal itself. It is merely a mutual promise not to use weapons that are still being kept. There is no way to be sure that these promises will be kept. The retention of large quantities of weapons and the continued production of weapons ominously suggest that these promises may be disregarded.

    B. If the Soviet proposal is implemented, the threat of aggression and war will not be reduced. Indeed, this threat may increase. Because if the potential aggressor's possible victims have already promised not to use nuclear weapons, the deterrent effect of these weapons on potential aggressors will undoubtedly be weakened. Such an aggressor may be tempted to launch an attack, hoping that the ban might prevent or delay the use of these weapons to defend his victims. On the other hand, an aggressor with nuclear weapons will be able to revoke his previous promises and use nuclear weapons at any time that suits him. Therefore, such a plan may only encourage aggression and weaken the aggressor's victims.

    XII. The Soviet proposal not only fails to meet the necessary tests for any effective plan to prevent atomic war, but it actually harms the opportunity to adopt any such effective plan. Because if the Soviet proposal is accepted, it will create a false impression that the threat of atomic war has been somewhat limited, thereby weakening people's vigilance against the actual threat that is increasing. This false sense of security can make people discouraged and no longer strive to achieve genuine disarmament under effective guarantees, thereby truly increasing overall security, reducing the threat of war, and lightening the heavy burden of armaments.

    Fourth Part

    XIII. The United States reaffirms, as it did in the resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 17, 1950: regardless of the methods used, aggression itself is the most serious of all dangers. Only when aggression occurs will the world face the danger of modern warfare.

    XIV. The signatories of the United Nations Charter have made a solemn commitment not to engage in aggression. The United States, in accordance with its historical tradition, will not violate this commitment. However, as previously pointed out, the United States believes that the only truly effective way to ensure that aggression does not occur and that nuclear weapons are not used in war is to adopt a balanced disarmament system with guarantees. Such a system can greatly reduce the possibility of successfully carrying out aggression, thereby minimizing the danger of any aggression to the lowest possible level.

    XV. The United States still believes that solving the problem of armaments is necessary. Although the United States cannot accept the Soviet proposal, it is still prepared to discuss acceptable measures for effective disarmament under appropriate guarantees at any time, either through continued secret exchanges of views or in the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Given the urgency of disarmament, the United States would welcome continued secret exchanges of views if the Soviet Union considers this to be a beneficial way and a common path to solving this problem.

    XVI. The United States also hopes that, in view of the above circumstances, the Soviet Union will be willing to express more opinions on the specific proposals made by the United States on March 19, 1954. In any case, the United States is prepared to resume negotiations with the Soviet Union on the President's proposal at any time.

    Document 12: Memorandum from Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko to Ambassador Charles E. Bohlen on September 22, 1954, in Moscow

    The Soviet government has studied the memorandum of the U.S. government of July 9, 1954, in response to the memorandum of the Soviet government of April 27, and considers it necessary to make the following statement:

    The Soviet government, in its memorandum of April 27, expressed certain views on the proposal of the U.S. government regarding the establishment of an international atomic energy agency, as mentioned by President Eisenhower in his speech of December 8, 1953. The Soviet government pointed out that the U.S. proposal stipulates that the participating countries hand over a portion of their stockpiled atomic materials to an international agency for peaceful purposes, but the implementation of this proposal cannot help to stop the production of atomic weapons. At the same time, it was pointed out that if only a small portion of atomic materials is allocated for peaceful purposes, while the majority of atomic materials are still used to produce atomic weapons, then the countries that have the potential to produce atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons will continue to increase their stockpiles of these weapons without any restrictions.

    The Soviet government, in its memorandum of April 27, also pointed out that the U.S. proposal avoids the issue of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, these weapons of mass destruction; the adoption of this U.S. proposal will in no way change the current situation: countries that have atomic materials and the corresponding potential to produce atomic weapons are increasingly producing and stockpiling atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs with ever-increasing destructive power. This situation will mean that the production of atomic weapons has been given de facto international approval, which not only cannot provide favorable conditions for reaching an agreement to prohibit atomic weapons and eliminate them from the armaments of countries, but will also create new obstacles to reaching such an agreement. It is not difficult to understand that this is only beneficial to potential aggressors.

    Therefore, the U.S. proposal does not meet the main goal of eliminating the threat of atomic war.

    The U.S. government, in its memorandum of July 9, expressed its willingness to seek ways to reduce the threat of war and the burden of armaments with other countries. The Soviet government believes that if the U.S. government, like the Soviet government, is committed to reducing the threat of war and the burden of armaments, then the two governments should make efforts to reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international supervision of this ban, and on the large-scale reduction of conventional armaments of countries.

    It is precisely for this purpose that the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed to the United Nations the conclusion of an international convention to unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction, and to significantly reduce conventional armaments. The Soviet government's proposals are based on the fact that these proposals are in line with the increasingly strong demands of the peoples of all countries, who demand the cessation of the expansion of armaments, including atomic weapons, and the adoption of urgent measures to save humanity from the catastrophe of destructive atomic war. The facts, contrary to what is said in the U.S. memorandum of July 9, are not the Soviet Union, but the United States, which has so far obstructed the reaching of an agreement to prohibit atomic weapons and significantly reduce conventional armaments under conditions acceptable to all sovereign, peaceful, and equal countries, and to establish effective supervision for the implementation of these agreements.

    An international agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of corresponding supervision of this ban will open up broad prospects for the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    Everyone knows that, due to the United States' rejection of an international agreement to prohibit atomic weapons with other countries at the time when the atomic issue first arose, there has not yet been an international agreement to unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    However, the fact that such an agreement has not yet been reached does not diminish the significance of the efforts to reach the necessary agreement between the relevant countries.

    The Soviet proposal for all countries to unconditionally assume the obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other types of weapons of mass destruction is precisely the new effort of the Soviet government to find a way out of the current situation.

    This proposal has already been submitted in the form of a draft declaration to Mr. John Foster Dulles on January 30.

    If countries renounce the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, it means: a significant step has been taken towards the complete elimination of these weapons from the armaments of countries and the establishment of strict international supervision to ensure the implementation of the agreement to prohibit the use of atomic energy for military purposes. Through the above declaration, the threat of atomic war is of great significance in eliminating the use of atomic weapons and helping to strengthen international trust and ease international tensions, and at the same time helping to improve the atmosphere, the importance of which is also mentioned in the U.S. government's memorandum. From the U.S. government's memorandum of July 9, it can be seen that the U.S. government has taken a negative attitude towards the above Soviet proposal. The U.S. government's reason for opposing the Soviet proposal is that it cannot believe that an agreement on the unconditional renunciation of the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons by countries can be fulfilled. If this view is followed, then it must be considered that almost all international treaties and all agreements, as well as the obligations assumed under these treaties and agreements, should be doubted. Obviously, this is unacceptable, because it violates the established principles and standards of international relations. In fact, the international obligations assumed by countries in accordance with the declaration of the renunciation of the use of weapons of mass destruction are not less significant, but much greater, compared to some important international agreements that have been concluded in the past (the good effects of these agreements have been recognized by all). Everyone knows that during the First World War, due to the lack of corresponding international agreements, weapons of mass destruction such as suffocating and poisonous gases, as well as other chemical weapons, were widely used, and this behavior was severely condemned by the peoples of all countries. It was precisely for this reason that it was considered necessary to conclude an international agreement to prohibit the use of such weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, the Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Chemical and Bacteriological Weapons was signed in 1925. Everyone knows that during the Second World War, this protocol played an important role in preventing the use of chemical weapons and bacteriological weapons, and thus avoided the serious consequences that the use of such weapons by the belligerent countries might have brought to the peoples of all countries.

    This fact shows that the conclusion of international agreements, in which everyone assumes the obligation not to use a certain type of weapon in war, is not only possible but necessary, and is an important method of fighting for the consolidation of peace. This must first be applied to the agreement on the handling of the most destructive weapons known to the world so far (atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons).

    The statement in the U.S. government's memorandum that the conclusion of an international agreement on the renunciation of the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons by countries may increase the danger of war, and that the current situation of unrestricted expansion of the production of atomic weapons is safer than the conclusion of an agreement on the renunciation of the use of these types of weapons, is untenable. This statement is obviously contradictory to the actual situation and facts. It is precisely because of the appearance of atomic weapons, followed by hydrogen weapons, rockets, and other new types of weapons of mass destruction with increasing destructive power, that the arms race, including the production of atomic weapons, has intensified, and at the same time, the threat of atomic war, which will bring serious consequences to the peoples of all countries, has intensified.

    On the contrary, the renunciation of the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons by countries will change the international situation, promote further easing of international tensions, and reduce the burden on the peoples due to the expansion of armaments and the excessive expenditure of many countries in maintaining large armed forces. This will first create conditions for achieving the next step—the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and their elimination from national armaments.

    In the memorandum of the Soviet government of April 27, it was emphasized that the process of obtaining electricity from atomic materials can be implemented on an industrial scale, in which case the amount of fissionable material does not decrease, but rather increases. At the same time, non-dangerous substances become dangerous and easily explosive substances, which can be used as the basis for the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. This means that the peaceful use of atomic energy is linked to the simultaneous production of easily explosive atomic materials used in the manufacture of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, which inevitably leads to an increase in the scale of production of atomic weapons and an increase in their stockpiles.

    In the memorandum of the U.S. government, it is pointed out that there can be ways to ensure that materials produced by power reactors are not diverted, and according to the opinion of the U.S. government, there are also peaceful applications of atomic energy that will not raise the issue of materials of the weapon type. The Soviet government is prepared to study the views of the U.S. government on this issue in further negotiations.

    The proposal of the U.S. government and the proposal of the Soviet government, as well as the views expressed by the two governments in the negotiations, show that the positions of the two sides on several substantive issues have so far proven to be inconsistent.

    In the negotiations, the Soviet government has insisted on the necessity of such an international agreement that can ensure the prevention of the use of atomic energy for military purposes and the complete use of atomic energy for peaceful needs, to bring happiness to humanity. The U.S. government has also expressed its willingness to promote the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    Since the consistency of the positions of the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue is of great importance for reaching an international agreement on the use of atomic energy for peaceful needs, the Soviet government believes that the two governments should continue to make efforts to bring their positions closer. It cannot be considered that the possibility of consistency between the two sides has been exhausted, especially since some specific issues raised by the proposals of the Soviet Union and the United States have not been sufficiently studied. A comprehensive study of these issues will help to further clarify the possibility of reaching the corresponding agreement.

    In this regard, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to draw the attention of the U.S. government to several important principles that must be considered in discussing the issue of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet government is based on the following premise: the important precondition for an international agreement on this issue is the recognition that any such agreement should not place any country or group of countries in a privileged position, enabling that country or group of countries to impose its will on other countries. This should be particularly emphasized regarding the U.S. proposals on the composition and management of the international agency.

    Any international agency established on the basis of corresponding agreements between countries must, in order to successfully fulfill its responsibilities, have broad powers to effectively fulfill the tasks it is entrusted with, but at the same time, these powers must not be used to harm the security of any country. Only when the rights, duties, and actual actions of such an international agency conform to the principles recognized in the United Nations Charter, can it fulfill its tasks.

    The Soviet government agrees with the opinion of the U.S. government that the relevant international agency should report its work to the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly. Naturally, if an issue affecting the security of a country arises in this matter, the Security Council should make the necessary decisions, because it is the main body responsible for maintaining peace and international security. This was acknowledged as early as January 1946 in the first resolution of the United Nations on the atomic issue.

    The Soviet government has noted the statement of the U.S. government that it is prepared to resume negotiations on the issue of the peaceful use of atomic energy at any time. The Soviet government, for its part, is prepared to continue such negotiations to study the proposals of the Soviet government and the U.S. government.

    Finally, the Soviet government hopes to know whether the U.S. government considers it possible to publish the views exchanged by the governments of the Soviet Union and the United States in the negotiations on the atomic issue in the newspapers of the Soviet Union and the United States, so that the public can understand the content of the talks. The Soviet government considers that during the period of the Soviet-U.S. talks, some news has appeared in the newspapers, which has made incorrect reports on certain issues regarding the positions of the two sides.

    关于苏联政府和美国政府之间的原子问题谈判
    报纸已经报道过，坚持不渝地奉行和平政策的苏联政府，曾经表示愿意参加就艾森豪威尔总统一九五三年十二月八日所提出的关于国际间为了和平目的利用原子能的建议而举行的秘密的或外交的谈判。苏联政府在它一九五三年十二月二十一日的答复中说：它是从这样一个前提出发的，就是：在谈判过程中会同时审查苏联的下列建议：
    “参与协议的各国，本着缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，将承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。
    在这个问题上如果取得国际协议，那么，就将是向着从国家军备中完全取消原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器，并建立严格的国际监督以保证禁止把原子能用于军事目的的协定得到遵守，走出了重要的一步。”
    在苏联政府和美国政府随后进行的谈判过程中交换了相应的文件。
    苏联政府于九月二十二日向美国政府建议把有关这些谈判的全部文件分别在苏联报纸和美国报纸上公布，以便使舆论界对这些谈判得以了解。苏联政府指出，公布关于谈判的全部外交文件之所以必要，是因为报纸上出现了曲解双方的立场的报道。
    九月二十三日，美国政府同意了苏联政府的建议。
    苏联外交部特此公布苏联政府和美国政府在原子问题的谈判过程中所交换的全部文件。
    各种文件的全文如下：
    文件一　美国国务卿约·福·杜勒斯一九五四年一月十一日在华盛顿交给苏联驻美国大使格·纳·查鲁宾的备忘录（由俄文复译）
    一、美国建议，原子能谈判应首先通过外交途径进行，各方都保有得以按照联合国关于在裁军委员会的监督下举行秘密谈判的决议把谈判移交联合国进行的权利。
    二、兹建议外交谈判应在华盛顿或者任何其他对于参加方面举行会谈方便的地方举行。
    预期莫洛托夫先生和杜勒斯先生将在柏林举行一次秘密讨论。
    三、兹建议：关于程序问题的谈判，在初期阶段应限于苏联和美国举行，可以按照所讨论的问题的性质决定有其他主要有关国家参加。
    四、美国准备考虑苏联认为宜于提出的关于原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的任何建议。
    五、但是，美国认为，初期的努力应该在足以产生在更广泛的规模上进行规划所必须的信赖和信任的适当基础上进行。因此，美国要求尽早讨论艾森豪威尔总统一九五三年十二月八日提出的建议。美国准备就这个计划及其实施的可能性开始具体的秘密谈判。
    六、美国认为，保持秘密在目前最有可能促进获得具体结果，任何一方不得利用这种谈判来进行宣传。
    文件二　格·纳·查鲁宾一月十九日在华盛顿交给约·福·杜勒斯先生的备忘录
    关于国务卿杜勒斯先生一月十一日交给格·纳·查鲁宾大使的备忘录，苏联政府认为有必要作以下的声明：
      一、美国的备忘录第一点说：
      “美国建议：原子能谈判应首先通过外交途径进行，各方都保有得以按照联合国关于在裁军委员会的监督下举行秘密谈判的决议把谈判移交联合国进行的权利。”
    关于这一点，没有意见。
    二、美国的备忘录第二点说：
    “兹建议外交谈判应在华盛顿或者任何其他对于参加方面举行会谈方便的地方举行。预期莫洛托夫先生和杜勒斯先生将在柏林举行一次秘密讨论。”
    对于第二点，没有意见。
    三、美国的备忘录第三点说：
    “兹建议：关于程序问题的谈判，在初期阶段应限于苏联和美国举行，可以按照所讨论的问题的性质决定有其他主要有关国家参加。”
    对于备忘录第三点所提出的考虑表示同意，因为在谈判的一定阶段应该考虑到邀请所有对维护和平和国际安全负有主要责任的国家参加谈判的需要。
    四、美国的备忘录第四点说：
    “美国准备考虑苏联认为宜于提出的关于原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的任何建议。”
    在这方面有必要复述苏联政府一九五三年十二月二十一日的声明，声明指出，苏联政府是从这样一个前提出发的，就是：在谈判过程中，会同时审查苏联政府的下列建议：参与协议的各国将承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不再使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。
    五、美国的备忘录第五点说：
    “但是，美国认为，初期的努力应该在足以产生在更广泛的规模上进行规划所必须的信赖和信任的适当基础上进行。因此，美国要求尽早讨论艾森豪威尔总统一九五三年十二月八日提出的建议。美国准备就这个计划及其实施的可能性开始具体的秘密谈判。”
    苏联政府同意开始审查艾森豪威尔总统一九五三年十二月八日提出的建议，并且也同意开始关于这个建议的上述谈判。苏联政府同时认为有必要达成这样的谅解：在讨论美国这个建议和苏联在第四点中所提到的建议时，应该遵守轮换的原则，一次会议讨论美国的建议，下一次会议就讨论苏联的建议。
    六、美国的备忘录第六点说：
    “美国认为，保持秘密在目前最有可能促进获得具体结果，任何一方不得利用这种谈判来进行宣传。”
    对于这一点，没有意见。
    文件三　苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫一月三十日在柏林交给约·福·杜勒斯先生的、美国、英国、法国、中华人民共和国和苏联五国政府关于无条件地不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的宣言草案
    美利坚合众国、英国、法国、中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的政府，
    决心拯救人类免于使用原子武器、氢武器或其他大规模毁灭性武器的破坏性战争的威胁，
    力求用各种方法促使把原子能方面的伟大的科学发现只用于和平目的、用于增进各国人民的福利和改善他们的生活条件，
    考虑到各国无条件地不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器符合于联合国的基本目的，并将是一个重要步骤，以导向从国家军备中完全取消原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器、并实行严格的国际监督以保证禁止把原子能用于军事目的的协定得到遵守，
    遵从各国人民要求缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，
    庄严地宣布：它们承担无条件地不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的义务；
    号召一切其他国家参加本宣言。
    文件四　维·米·莫洛托夫二月十三日在柏林交给约·福·杜勒斯先生的备忘录
    一：苏联政府在苏联驻华盛顿大使于一九五四年一月十九日交给美国国务卿的备忘录中，表示了这样的意见：在原子问题谈判的后一阶段，应邀请所有对维持和平和国际安全负有主要责任的国家参加。
    维·米·莫洛托夫在今年一月三十日和杜勒斯先生的一次私人会谈中，解释上面所指的国家是五个国家：美国、苏联、英国、法国和中华人民共和国。
    二：杜勒斯先生在这次会谈中曾表示这样的意见：应邀请英国、法国、还有加拿大和比利时参加关于原子问题的谈判，他并解释说，加拿大和比利时应作为拥有原子原料资源的国家参加谈判。
    三：关于这一点，苏联政府说，它并不反对关于原子问题的谈判在适当阶段，除了五国以外，还邀请加拿大和比利时参加，苏联政府也认为邀请捷克斯洛伐克作为一个拥有原子原料资源的国家参加上述谈判是必要的。
                    一九五四年二月十三日
    文件五　约·福·杜勒斯先生二月十六日在柏林送交维·米·莫洛托夫先生的信：亲收——机密亲爱的部长先生：
    我对您一九五四年二月十三日交给我的关于原子建议的讨论的备忘录表示意见。
    在您标明号码的第二段中，您说，我“曾表示这样的意见：应邀请英国、法国、还有加拿大和比利时参加关于原子问题的谈判，（他）并解释说，加拿大和比利时应作为拥有原子原料资源的国家参加谈判”。这种说法与我所记得的我在一月三十日就这个问题发表的意见并不完全一致。我希望澄清这种明显的误解。我在那次讨论中说，英国、加拿大和法国都在原子能方面取得了进展。我然后又提到这种原料的重要出产国比利时和其他国家。在这种情况下，我表示，如果我们把我们的会谈从双边的基础上转变为比较广泛的会议，在那个阶段美国就要提出哪些国家应参加会议的问题。
    关于将来的可能参加者这个一般性问题，我希望再一次提请您注意：我在这里（柏林）不止一次提出过一般性声明。这就是：美国不准备参加有中国共产党政权参加的、以这个政权承担或分担任何维护国际和平和安全的特别责任为基础的会议。
    我希望我能够在返回华盛顿之后随即在华盛顿交给查鲁宾大使一份关于美国总统的建议的内容的备忘录。
    对您忠实的约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯（签字）
    文件六　维·米·莫洛托夫二月十八日在柏林送交约·福·杜勒斯的信
    我已收到您一九五四年二月十六日的来信。
    因为您准备今天离开这里，所以我将通过苏联驻华盛顿大使查鲁宾交给您我对您的来信的答复。
    尊敬您的维·莫洛托夫（签字）
    文件七　格·纳·查鲁宾三月十日在华盛顿交给美国代理国务卿
  华·贝·史密斯的维·米·莫洛托夫对二月十六日杜勒斯先生的来信的答复
    关于美国国务卿在今年二月十六日致苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫的信件，我奉维·米·莫洛托夫的训令作如下声明：
    在这封信中所谈到的认为目前不宜规定在原子问题谈判的后一阶段应该邀请哪些具体国家参加谈判的理由已经得到考虑。
    如早些时候查鲁宾大使在一月十九日交给杜勒斯先生的备忘录和维·米·莫洛托夫和杜勒斯先生在柏林的私人会谈中所说的，苏联政府同意在双边基础上和美国政府谈判原子问题，同时，如果决定将谈判转到一个比较广泛的会议上去进行的话，对于另外审查这种会议的成员问题并没有反对意见。
    至于中华人民共和国在以后的阶段可能参加关于原子问题的谈判一事，苏联政府在这个问题上的意见已在二月十三日的备忘录中提出。
    文件八　约·福·杜勒斯先生三月十九日在华盛顿交给格·纳·查鲁宾的备忘录
    美国政府希望再提出一些初步意见来说明美国总统一九五三年十二月八日向联合国大会提出的建立国际原子能机构的建议：
    壹、美国建议的目的
    美国建议在联合国的主持下，成立一个国际原子能机构来接受那些有核子原料存货的成员国所提供的核子原料，以便把这些原料用于下列目的：
    一、以保证全世界工程师和科学家有足够的原料来进行研究并发展原子能的和平用途的活动的办法和奖励交流情报的办法，来鼓励全世界研究并发展原子能的和平用途。
    二、供应核子原料来满足农业、医疗和其他和平活动、包括最后生产动力的需要。
    贰、国际原子能机构
    一、这个机构将根据参与国所缔结的条约的条款而建立并获得权力。条约应该尽可能切实可行地规定这个机构在履行它的职权时所应遵循的标准和原则。
    二、成员问题——所有签字国都将成为这个机构的成员。
    三、管理机构
      甲、这个机构的最高执行权力应该由一个由代表各国政府的、数目有限的成员组成的理事会行使。在确定理事会的组成时，最好考虑到将来受惠国的地理分布情况和是否是成员国。希望主要的捐献国都参加理事会。
      乙、建议理事会在作出决定时，一般应该采用某种多数表决的形式。可以作出一些安排来使主要的捐献国在像分配可分裂物质之类的某些问题上有特殊的表决权。
    四、工作人员——这个机构的工作人员应该由一个行政负责人或者总经理来领导，这个行政负责人或者总经理由理事会任命任职一定期限，并受理事会的监督，工作人员中当然包括很能胜任的科学和技术人员。行政负责人应在理事会的总监督下负责人员的任命、组织和进行工作。
    五、经费
      甲、这个机构的中央设备和固定的工厂以及它的研究工作计划的经费，应由参与国根据一致同意的捐献比率拨款支付。兹建议，可以运用规定联合国各会员国捐献比率的一般原则。

    文件九  四月二十七日维·米·莫洛托夫在日内瓦交给约·福·杜勒斯先生的备忘录
    艾森豪威尔总统在一九五三年十二月八日的演说中谈到国际原子能机构问题，今年三月十九日的美国政府备忘录中对这个国际原子能机构有更多的说明。针对着美国政府的这个备忘录，苏联政府认为有必要提出下列的考虑。
    美国总统在上述的演说中强调原子武器的特别危险性，他建议相应的国家把它们的原子原料存货的一小部分交给这个国际机构以用于和平用途。三月十九日的备忘录谈到上述国际机构的组织的某些细节，但完全忽视了苏联政府在十二月二十一日就美国总统十二月八日的演说发表的声明里所表示的意见。而苏联政府表示这些意见的目的在于就禁止原子武器问题达成协议，在于使各国在最近的将来负责保证不使用在本质上属于侵略性武器的原子武器和氢武器。
    美国总统在他十二月八日的演说中说：“我国希望进行建设，而不是进行毁灭。它希望国际协议，而不是国际战争。”在这篇演说中，美国总统又说：“美国注意到联合国大会的这个建议，立即准备与那些可能是‘主要有关’的其他国家举行秘密会谈，以便‘设法求得’一个关于原子军备竞赛的‘能让人接受的解决办法’，因为原子军备竞赛的阴影不仅笼罩着和平，而且笼罩着世界的生存。”
    美国总统的这些话表示了和平的愿望，同其他国家代表共同设法解决原子军备竞赛问题的愿望，达成“国际协议、而不是国际战争”的愿望。苏联政府一贯诚心要加强国际和平，在目前的情况下特别是要促使原子战争威胁得以消除，因此，苏联政府表示准备随时参加相应的谈判。
    苏联政府在这样做的时候，过去认为、现在仍然认为有必要提请特别注意下列事实：
    一、美国建议各国把它们的原子原料存货的一小部分交给国际机构以用于和平用途，这并不能促使美国总统在上述演说中所提出的目的的实现。在
  一小部分原子原料用于和平用途的时候，大部分原子原料却将仍然用于制造新的原子弹和氢弹，这意味着继续大量储存原子武器，并可能发展具有更大破坏力量的新式的这样的武器。这种局势意味着能够制造原子武器和氢武器的国家将可以放手地继续增加这些武器的储存。
    要从现有的原子原料存货中拿出一小部分用于和平用途，看起来就只有把用于制造原子武器和氢武器的原子原料数量不断减少。但是，实际上情况根本不会这样。在一些国家中，每年原子原料的生产增加得非常迅速，因此，即使拿出一定的部分用于和平用途，也决不会使新制造的原子弹和氢弹的数目减少。因此，即使美国的建议付诸实施，也不能说原子军备竞赛就会停止——如美国总统在十二月八日的演说中所说的那样。由于目前科学和技术成就的水平之高，已有可能利用原子能在和平用途上的应用来增加原子武器的生产。
    大家知道，在实践上已有可能在工业的规模上通过使用原子原料来生产电力用于和平用途，在这种生产过程中使用的可分裂的原子原料的数量不但不减少，实际上反而增加。而且，没有危险性的原子原料将被改变成为爆炸性的可分裂的物质，而这种物质就是制造原子武器和氢武器的基础。换句话说，在实践中不容置辩地证明了：原子能的和平应用和同时能够生产用来制造原子武器的原子原料是分不开的。这样一种情况，不但不能使用来制造原子武器的原子原料储藏量减少，反而将因为各个国家中这种原料的生产越来越多、国际机构本身也在生产，而促成这种储藏量的漫无限制的增加。
    因此，美国提出的以一部分的原子原料用于和平用途的建议，非但不能停止原子军备竞赛，反而将导向这种军备竞赛的进一步激烈化。
    二、美国在十二月八日提出的建议，和美国在三月十九日提出的备忘录一样，完全把不能容许使用属于大规模毁灭性武器的原子武器这一点置之不顾。
    采纳艾森豪威尔总统的建议丝毫也不会限制人们为了任何目的在任何时候使用原子武器来进行侵略，因此，也丝毫不会减少使用原子武器和氢武器的战争的危险。
    目前拥有原子原料和制造原子武器的适当的工业和技术设备的国家，在越来越大的规模上制造着并大量储存着破坏力愈来愈大的原子弹和氢弹，在这种情况下，就是采纳上述的美国建议，也不会改变目前的形势。而且，这一切都是在完全没有限制各国使用原子武器和氢武器的任何国际协定的情况下进行的。
    但是，无可否认的是：由于越来越大的原子武器破坏力量，特别是由于氢武器的出现，最近许多国家内不安情绪已很普遍。如果漠视这些大家都知道的事实，漠视防止在战争中使用原子武器和氢武器的越来越迫切的要求，那是错误的。
    从上述一切中可以得出这样的结论：无论十二月八日的美国建议和三月十九日的美国备忘录，都不符合主要的目的——消除原子战争的威胁。
    苏联政府在十二月二十一日的声明中指出，如果美国政府同苏联政府一样切望缓和国际紧张局势，加强和平，那么，两国政府就应该为谋求就禁止原子武器和对这个禁令实施充分有效的国际监督问题达成协议而努力。
    这种在国际上禁止使用原子武器，将为原子能的和平应用开辟广泛的机会。由于美国总统十二月八日的演说和美国三月十九日的备忘录对禁止原子武器置之不顾，并且事实上使这些武器的生产可以继续无限制地增加，使侵略者可以使用这些武器，因此，美国提出的成立一个国际原子能机构的建议丝毫没有减少原子战争的危险。而且，它可能为直接相反的目的服务。这个把一部分原子原料用于和平用途的建议可能造成一种原子武器的制造量已有减少的骗人印象，因而使各国人民对于使用这种大规模毁灭人民的侵略武器的战争的日益严重的危险放松警惕。
    到目前为止，还不能就无条件禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的问题达成相应的协议，但这一事实不但没有使这方面的努力的意义有任何减少，相反地，使这种努力显得更加必要了，因为制造原子武器及氢武器的有增无已的竞赛对各国人民来说是一种日益增加的威胁。这特别适用于那些拥有相当的原子原料资源，并且正在制造
  原子武器与氢武器的国家。
    如果把这个问题缩小到仅仅是国家之间达成这样一种协议，规定把一小部分的原子原料用于和平用途却又不限制原子武器将来的制造的话，这样一种国际协议事实上是准许制造原子武器，而这只会对于侵略势力有利，是决不能容许的。这样一种关于制造原子武器的国际批准，不但不能促成禁止原子武器的协议，反而会使这样一个协议的达成遇到新的障碍。
    必须不是把一小部分原子原料，而是把全部原子原料都完全应用于和平用途，必须把这一方面的科学成就不是用于战争与大规模毁灭人民的目的，而是用于经济与文化发展，以便提供前所未有的可能性，来发展工业、农业与运输业，来应用在医学上，来精益求精地改进技术，并进一步推进科学。
    禁止原子武器与氢武器，把全部原子原料用于和平用途，再加上给予经济落后地区必要的援助，就会同时促进常规军备的大量裁减。这样一来，就有可能大大减轻由于许多国家继续不断扩充军备、漫无节制地扩大军队而加于各国人民身上的赋税负担。
    苏联政府希望促成关于无条件地完全禁止原子武器以及建立充分国际监督的协议，因此，它在表示准备参加关于美国政府建议的谈判的同时，提出了下列建议以供考虑：
    参与协议的各国，本着缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，将承担起庄严的、无条件的义务，不使用原子武器、氢武器或任何其他大规模毁灭性武器。
    构成苏联政府一月三十日向美国政府及英国、法国和中华人民共和国政府提出的美国、英国、法国、中华人民共和国和苏联五国政府宣言草案的基础的，也正是这个建议。要是各国，首先是各个大国，负责保证无条件地放弃使用原子武器和氢武器，就会意味着在向着为人类解除原子战争威胁及这种威胁所带来的不可估量的牺牲和苦难这个方向前进了一大步。
    苏联政府注意到：美国政府仍然还没有承认必须立即禁止原子武器和氢武器和对这个禁令实行适当的国际监督，甚至还没有表示准备就各国无条件放弃使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器取得协议。
    苏联政府特别重视使苏联和美国在各国庄严地并无条件地负责保证不使用原子武器、氢武器或任何其他大规模毁灭性武器上所持的立场一致。在国际间没有就放弃使用原子武器问题达成协议的情况下，研究关于把一部分原子原料用于民用事业的单独的建议，决不会有助于缓和国际紧张局势和减少战争危险。而且，它还能够麻痹各国人民对这个面前的危险的警惕。
    鉴于上述考虑，并根据艾森豪威尔总统关于美国愿望缓和国际紧张局势的演说，苏联政府认为亟须首先在苏联和美国之间就放弃使用原子武器达成谅解，如果没有这种谅解，那么已经开始的谈判就不可能产生我们两国人民以及其他国家人民所关心的结果。
    至于美国三月十九日的备忘录——显而易见，这份备忘录是不充分的，是片面的——中所涉及的其他问题，可以在就基本问题取得协议后再行研究。
    文件十  约·福·杜勒斯先生五月一日在日内瓦交给维·米·莫洛托夫的秘密备忘录
    一、我已读过苏联四月二十七日就三月十九日在华盛顿交给苏联大使的建立“国际原子能机构”的建议所提出的备忘录。这个备忘录批评了美国的建议，理由是：这个建议既不会大大减少原子原料储存，也不会管制原子武器的制造或使用，或消除原子战争的威胁。
    二、这些批评误解了三月十九日美国建议的目的。从这个建议的内容中可以看出，它并不要作为管制原子武器或解决苏联照会中提到的各种其他问题的措施。它的目的是比较有限度的，即在原子能方面在可以避免许多障碍——这些障碍以前一直阻挠了达成任何协议——的基础上开始进行国际合作。这样，这个建议能够有助于改善合作国家之间的关系，从而促进有效地管制原子能的军事用途这一个较为困难的问题的解决。
    三、因此，美国不能同意苏联这样的意见：建立一个国际机构以促进原子物质的和平用途这一着本身并无好处。相反的，美国相信这样的机构不论在鼓励参加国家进行更为密切的合作方面，以及在便利更为广泛地把原子能用于造福人类的用途方面，都能够产生有价值的结果。因此，美国对于苏联不愿在此时进一步研究这个问题表示遗憾。
    四、鉴于苏联对于在现在实行这个建议缺乏兴趣，美国认为它将可以自由地与其他可能感到兴趣的国家一起研究建立这样一个机构的问题。如果苏联在以后决定愿意参加任何这种讨论，美国当然将欢迎它参加。
    五、当然，美国三月十九日的建议并不是作为代替管制原子能用于军事用途的有效制度的方案提出的。美国将继续像迄今为止所做的那样，寻求在可靠和适当的保障下实现这种管制的途径。它准备继续为此目的与苏联交换意见，并将在不久之后把它对于苏联在四月二十七日的备忘录中所提出的建议的意见交给苏联。
    文件十一美国助理国务卿麦钱
  特先生七月九日在华盛顿交给格·
  纳·查鲁宾的备忘录
    美国进一步考虑了苏联分别于一月三十日和四月二十七日交给美国的宣言草案和备忘录。美国愿提出下列意见：
      第一部分
    一、总统一九五三年十二月八日在联合国大会的演说指出了原子军备竞赛的危险性，并强调美国愿望以任何包括有防止违反和规避行为的适当保障的有效方法来消除这种危险。美国将欢迎任何足以保护世界各国人民不受战争威胁，并在符合他们安全的条件下解除他们沉重的军事防御负担的裁减军备制度。
    二、同时，美国没有忘记一九四六年以来在设法协议一个裁军计划时所经历的困难。自那时到现在，美国一贯地——有时独自，有时和其他国家一道——在寻找减轻军备负担和减少战争威胁的办法。从一九四六年一直到一九四八年在联合国原子能委员会中，从一九四七年一直到一九五○年在常规军备委员会中，一九四九年和一九五○年在联合国原子能委员会六个常任委员国的特别会议上，和一九五一年以来在联合国裁军委员会中，占压倒多数的国家都是能够达成协议的，只是由于苏联的阻挠，才没有取得进展。
    三、尽管有这种令人沮丧的纪录，总统在十二月八日的演说中说，美国注意到联合国大会一九五三年十一月二十八日的决议，“准备与那些可能是‘主要有关’的其他国家举行秘密会谈，以便‘设法求得’一个关于原子军备竞赛的‘能让人接受的解决办法’，因为原子军备竞赛的阴影不仅笼罩着和平，而且笼罩着世界的生存。”
        第二部分
      四、总统在他的演说中还说，美国将在这些会谈中提出一个新的建议，主张建立一个国际原子能机构来加快实现利用原子能为人类的和平事业服务。美国在三月十九日的备忘录中更详细地解释了它对于把这种观念变成实际的现实的办法的意见。苏联四月二十七日的备忘录似乎完全误解了这个具体建议的目的。
      五、这个建议的目的是为了给世界各国人民带来原子能的和平利益创立一个开端。美国的这个建议——和其他有原子设备的国家一道为了共同利益提供可分裂的物质和原子能技术——将为国际合作提供新的机会。在实现总统建议方面的成功的合作结果肯定地将会改善气氛，而气氛的改善又能够大为增进真诚的、有保障的国际裁减军备的前景。
    建议本身不是作为一个裁减军备计划提出来的。
    六、苏联四月二十七日的备忘录实际上是说，在美国同意禁止使用原子武器以前，苏联将不采取合作步骤，使世界得到原子力量的和平利益。据苏联说，抱着这种态度的主要理由是：根据总统在联合国提出的建议，在国际机构建立以后，武器一类的原料的储存能够继续增加。但是，苏联提出的禁止使用武器的建议也丝毫不能防止储存有这种增加。因此，美国不能认为，苏联的态度足以说明反对在这个时候着手采取步骤来促进原子能的和平用途是有确实根据的。
    七、苏联似乎还这样假定：对原子能的任何方式的和平应用，一定会增加可以用于军事用途的原料的储存。但是，实际上，可以想出办法来防止挪用产生动力的反应器所产生的原料。
    同时，也有着根本不会引起武器一类原料问题的和平应用原子能的方式。
    八、美国认为，在原子能的建设性的使用方面，知识最先进的国家，有义务在适当的条件下提供这种知识以普遍促进各国人民的福利。在核子科学的现阶段，美国认为现在有可能在这方面作出开端。
    因此，美国认为可以自行和其他有关国家实施它的建议，虽然苏联在目前并不愿意实施这个建议。如果在以后苏联决定参加任何这样的讨论，美国一定继续欢迎它参加。
      第三部分
    九、苏联提到它在一月三十日提出的建议，其中主张缔结一项规定无条件放弃使用原子武器、氢武器和其他形式的大规模毁灭性武器的国际协定。美国根据它一再宣布的政策——毫无偏见地研究对裁减军备问题建议的一切办法——彻底地并认真地考虑了这个建议。
    十、美国认为，任何有效的裁减军备计划，必须对下列两个基本问题提供满意的答复：
  甲、首先，这个计划是否在符合各国安全的情况下使各国军备真正的减少或废除？一项不使用武器的纸面上的诺言不会使各国能够减少它们的军备而仍保持安全。有任何武器存在，就有可能使用它。尽管有不使用武器的诺言，但是这些诺言是能够不经通知就加以撕毁的。
  乙、其次，这个计划是否大大减少或消除侵略和战争的威胁？如果任何计划事实上会逐渐增加潜在的侵略者诉诸战争的危险，那就不能达到裁减军备的基本目的。
    十一、一月三十日的苏联建议既没有满足这两项基本考验的任何一项，也没有提供在裁减军备方面产生有益结果的任何希望：
  甲、它将使现有的军备和继续军火生产丝毫不受影响。从苏联建议本身的条款就可以清楚地看到这一点。它仅仅是彼此保证不使用仍然保持着的武器。无法肯定这些保证一定会得到遵守。保持大量武器和继续制造武器不祥地预示着，这些保证有被置之不顾的危险。
  乙、如果苏联的建议付诸实施，侵略和战争的危险不会减轻。的确，这个危险可能增加起来。因为，如果侵略者的可能的受害者已经保证不使用核子武器的话，那么，这种武器的存在对潜在的侵略者的阻遏作用无疑地将会减弱。这样一种侵略者可能由于希望这个禁令或许会阻止或延迟使用这种武器来保卫他的受害者，从而禁不住要发动进攻。另一方面，拥有核子武器的侵略者将能够在对他有利的任何时候废除他以前的保证而使用核子武器。因此，这样一个计划可能只会怂恿侵略并削弱侵略的受害者。
    十二、苏联的建议不但没有满足对任何防止原子战争的有效计划的必要考验，事实上，它损害了采用任何这样的有效计划的机会。因为，如果接受苏联的建议，它势必会造成这样一种虚幻的印象：原子战争的危险多少已经受到限制了，从而削弱人们对于实际上只有增加的威胁的警惕性。这种虚幻的安全感能够使得大家心灰意懒，不再努力求得在有效的保障下实现真正裁减军备，以便真正增加全体的安全，减少战争的危险和减轻沉重的军备负担。
      第四部分
    十三、美国重申，像它在联合国大会一九五零年十一月十七日通过的决议中所重申的那样：不管其所用方法为何，侵略本身是一切危险中最严重的危险。只有在发生侵略时，世界才会有受到现代战争的恐怖的危险。
    十四、联合国宪章的签字国已经作出不进行侵略的庄严保证。美国遵照其历史性传统，决不违反这个保证。但是，如前所指出的，美国深信：保证侵略不致发生和战争中不致使用核子武器的唯一真正有效的办法，是采纳一个有保障的、平衡的裁减军备制度。这样一个制度能大大减少顺利地进行侵略的可能性，从而把发生任何侵略的危险缩小至最低限度。
    十五、美国仍然相信，解决军备问题是必须的。美国尽管无法接受苏联的建议，可是仍准备随时讨论在适当保障下实行有效的裁减军备的可以接受的措施。它准备以继续秘密交换意见的方式这样做，或者在联合国裁军委员会中这样做。鉴于裁减军备的紧迫性，美国将欢迎继续秘密交换意见，如果苏联认为这是解决这个问题的有益的办法和共同的途径的话。
    十六、美国还希望，参照上述情况，苏联将会愿意对美国在一九五四年三月十九日提出的具体建议发表更多的意见。不管怎么样，美国准备在任何时候同苏联就总统的建议重开谈判。
  文件十二　九月二十二日由苏联外交部副部长安·安·葛罗米柯在莫斯科交给美国驻苏大使查·波伦先生的备忘录。
    苏联政府研究了美国政府一九五四年七月九日答复苏联政府四月二十七日的备忘录的备忘录，认为有必要作如下声明：
    苏联政府在上述四月二十七日的备忘录中，就艾森豪威尔总统一九五三年十二月八日演说中谈到的美国政府关于建立国际原子能机构的建议表示了若干意见。苏联政府曾提请注意：美国的建议规定有关国家把它们所储存的原子原料的一部分交给一个国际机构掌握，以用于和平目的，但实现这一建议不能有助于停止扩充原子武器的生产。同时指出，如果只分出一小部分原子原料用于和平目的，而主要部分原子原料仍然用来生产原子武器，那么那些有可能生产原子武器和氢武器的国家仍将无所约束地继续增加这种武器的储存。
    苏联政府在上述四月二十七日的备忘录中还提请注意，美国的建议回避了关于禁止使用原子武器这种大规模毁灭性的武器的问题；采纳美国的这一建议丝毫不能改变目前这种形势：拥有原子原料和相应的原子武器生产的潜力的国家，在愈来愈大规模地生产着并储存着破坏力愈来愈大的原子弹和氢弹。这种情况将意味着，原子武器的生产已在实际上获得了不可容许的国际批准，这不仅不能为就禁止原子武器并将它从各国的军备中取消的问题达成协议提供有利条件，反而会为达成这一协议造成新的障碍。不难了解，这只适合潜在的侵略者的利益。
    因此，美国的建议是不符合消除原子战争威胁这一主要目的的。
    美国政府在七月九日的备忘录中，表示愿意和其他国家共同寻求减轻战争威胁和军备负担的道路。苏联政府认为，如果美国政府和苏联政府一样，致力于减轻战争威胁和军备负担，那么我们两国政府就应当努力来在禁止原子武器并对禁令的实施建立严格的国际监督方面，和在大量裁减各国常规军备方面达成协议。
    正是为了这一目的，苏联政府曾不止一次地向联合国建议缔结一个国际公约，规定无条件禁止原子武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器、大量裁减常规军备。苏联政府提出这些建议的出发点是：这些建议是符合各国人民日益强烈的要求的，他们要求停止扩充军备，包括原子武器在内，要求采取刻不容缓的措施，以使人类免遭毁灭性的原子战争的惨祸。事实同美国七月九日的备忘录中所说的相反，不是苏联、而是美国直到现在还在阻挠在一切自主的和平等的国家可以接受的条件下，达成禁止原子武器和大量裁减常规军备的协议，并为实现这些协议建立有效的监督。
    关于禁止原子武器并对这种禁令建立相应的监督的国际协议，将为把原子能用于和平目的开辟广泛的前景。
    大家知道，由于美国在原子问题刚一产生的时候就拒绝同其他国家一道缔结关于禁止原子武器的国际协定，所以直到现在还没有能就无条件禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器达成相应的国际协议。
    但是，到目前为止还不能达成这种协议的情况，并不应缩小为在有关国家之间达成必要的协议而进行的努力的意义。
    苏联关于各国无条件承担不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他各种大规模毁灭性武器的义务的建议，就是苏联政府想从目前所造成的情况中寻找出路的新努力。
    这项建议已经以各国宣言草案的形式在一月三十日交给美国国务卿杜勒斯先生。
    各国如果放弃使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，就意味着：向着在各国军备中完全取消这种武器、并建立严格的国际监督以保证实现禁止将原子能用于军事目的的协议迈进了重要的一步。通过上述宣言对于消除使用原子武器的战争的威胁具有重大的意义，并有助于加强国际间的信任和缓和国际紧张局势，同时还有助于改善气氛，这一改善的重要性是美国政府在它的备忘录中也已说到的。从美国政府七月九日的备忘录中可以看出，美国政府对上述的苏联建议采取了否定的态度。美国政府反对苏联建议的借口是：它不能相信各国无条件拒绝使用原子武器和氢武器的协议是能够兑现的。如果根据这种观点，那么就必须认为：几乎对任何国际条约和任何协定以及根据这些条约和协定承担的义务都应当表示怀疑。显然，这是不能令人同意的，因为这是违反国际关系的已确立的原则和标准的。事实上，各国根据拒绝使用大规模毁灭性武器的宣言所承担的国际义务，同某些过去缔结的重要的国际协定（这些协定的良好作用已为大家所公认）比较起来，意义不会更小，而是会大得多。大家知道，在第一次世界大战的时候，由于当时还没有相应的国际协定，广泛地使用了像窒息性毒气和中毒性毒气之类的大规模毁灭性武器以及其他化学武器，这种行为遭到了各国人民的严厉谴责。正因为如此，大家才认为必需缔结禁止使用这种大规模杀人武器的国际协定。因而，在一九二五年签订了关于禁止化学武器和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。大家知道，在第二次世界大战期间，这个议定书在防止使用化学武器和细菌武器中起了重要的作用，而使各国人民避免了交战国使用这类武器可能产生的严重后果。
    这一事实表明：缔结国际协定，大家承担在战争中不使用某种类型武器的义务，这不仅可能而且必要，这是为巩固和平而斗争的一个重要方法。这首先必须应用到处理世界迄今所知道的毁灭性最强的武器（原子武器和氢武器）的协定上去。
    美国政府备忘录中这样的说法是站不住脚的，它硬说缔结各国拒绝使用原子武器和氢武器的国际协定可能增加战争的危险性，并且认为目前这种无限制地扩大原子武器生产的形势，比缔结各国拒绝使用上述类型武器的协定更加来得安全。这种说法同实际状况、同事实显然是矛盾的。正是由于原子武器的出现，接着是氢武器和火箭以及其他新型的、毁灭力量愈来愈大的大规模毁灭性武器的出现，包括原子武器和氢武器生产在内的军备竞赛加紧了，同时，会给各国人民带来严重后果的原子战争的威胁也加紧了。
    相反地，各国拒绝使用原子武器和氢武器，就会改变国际形势，会促进进一步缓和国际紧张局势，会减轻由于扩张军备和许多国家维持庞大武装力量的过度开支所带给人民的重担。这首先会造成条件以达到下一个步骤——原子武器和氢武器的完全禁止和从国家军备中取消这些武器。
    在今年四月二十七日苏联政府的备忘录中曾着重指出，利用原子原料获得电力的这种过程可以在工业范围内实施，在这种情况下可分裂物质数量并没有减少，而相反地增加了。同时，不危险的物质变为危险的易爆炸的物质，可以作为生产原子武器和氢武器的基础。这就是说，原子能的和平应用是同同时生产制造原子武器用的易爆炸的原子原料连在一起的，这就不可避免地使生产原子武器的规模扩大和使这些武器的储存增加。
    在美国政府的备忘录中指出：可以有设法保证不致挪用生产动力的反应器所产生的原料的方式，而且据美国政府的意见，也有着根本不会引起武器一类原料问题的和平应用原子能的方式。苏联政府准备在进一步的谈判过程中研究美国政府对这个问题的见解。
    美国政府的建议和苏联政府的建议，以及两国政府在谈判中所发表的见解表明，双方在几个实质问题上的立场迄今证明不能取得一致。
    在谈判中，苏联政府过去和现在都坚持这样一种国际协定的必要性，这种协定足以保证防止原子能用于军事用途并使原子能可能完全用于和平需要、用来为人类谋幸福。美国政府也表示它愿意促进原子能的和平用途。
    由于美国和苏联在这一问题上的立场的取得一致对于就将原子能用于和平需要达成国际协议具有重要意义，苏联政府认为两国政府最好继续努力求得双方立场的接近。不能认为双方立场取得一致的可能性已经穷尽了，特别是由于苏联和美国的建议所引起的一些具体问题还没有加以应有的研究。对这些问题作全面的研究，会有助于进一步明确达成相应协议的可能性。
    在这方面，苏联政府认为不妨提请美国政府注意若干重要的原则，这些原则在讨论在原子能的和平应用方面实行国际合作这个问题时是不能不予以考虑的。苏联政府是从这一前提出发的，就是：关于这方面的国际协议的重要先决条件是承认：任何这种协议不应当把任何一个国家或者国家集团放到特权地位上，使这个国家或者国家集团能够把自己的意志强加于别的国家。对于美国提出的有关国际机构的构成和管理机构的建议，特别应当强调这一点。
    任何根据国与国之间的相应协议建立起来的国际机构要能顺利地履行它的职责，固然需要具有广泛的职权以使它有效地履行它所负担的任务，但同时更需要这种职权不被用来损害任何一国的安全。只有当这种国际机构的权利、任务以及实际行动符合于公认的联合国宪章中的原则的时候，它才能履行自己的任务。
    苏联政府同意美国政府下列意见：有关的国际机构应当向联合国安全理事会和联合国大会报告工作。自然，如果在这件事情上发生了影响到某一国家的安全的问题，应当由安全理事会作出必要的决定，因为它是对维持和平和国际安全担负着主要责任的机构。这一点早在一九四六年一月联合国第一次作出关于原子问题的决议时就是被承认了的。
    苏联政府注意到美国政府声明准备在任何时候恢复关于和平使用原子能问题的谈判，苏联政府在自己这方面，表示准备继续举行这种谈判，来研究苏联政府的和美国政府的建议。
    最后，苏联政府希望知道，美国政府是否认为可以将苏美两国政府在原子问题谈判中所交换的意见在苏联和美国报纸上予以发表，使舆论界对会谈的内容得以了解。苏联政府考虑到，在苏美会谈进行的期间，报纸上出现了一些消息，对有关双方立场的某些问题作了不正确的报道。
