Workers of the United Coal Mining Machine face in Datong Mining Bureau No. 6 Well
    Create a New National Record of Over 15,000 Tons of Monthly Production
    The entire workforce on the combined coal mining machine face at Datong Mining Bureau's No. 6 Well, in the labor competition to celebrate the convocation of the National People's Congress and to welcome the 1954 National Day in September, created a new national monthly production record for combined coal mining machine faces by producing 15,079 tons of coal. (Note: The previous highest record was 13,292 tons).
    At the beginning of September, the workers of the combined coal mining machine face at No. 6 Well, based on the good results achieved in July and August, formulated a plan and launched a nationwide labor competition. The workers conscientiously implemented regular cyclical operations in production (from coal cutting, support, roof caving to transporting coal out of the working face is called one cycle). After hearing the news that the great leader Mao Zedong was elected Chairman of the People's Republic of China, they created an unprecedented record of 705 tons of daily production on the 29th. This working face completed fifty-seven cyclical operations throughout the month.
    During the competition, the workers put forward the slogan of "Don't waste a minute," carried out technological innovations, and tried every means to shorten the time of all auxiliary work. First, the driver of the combined coal mining machine improved the machine lowering operation method
  (The combined coal mining machine works from the lower part of the working face and gradually moves upward; after completing one cycle, the combined coal mining machine must be put back to the lower part of the working face), shortening the time for lowering the machine. Secondly, the entire district further strengthened production management, and each type of work team put forward guarantee conditions to each other, achieving close cooperation and completing the tasks of each type of work on time, which enabled the combined coal mining machine working time in September to reach five hours per day. In production, workers conscientiously implemented operating procedures and various systems, strictly implemented the systems formulated by the team, and assigned specific personnel to be responsible for each type of work. Under the unified action of ensuring the completion of the production plan, the workers consciously completed their tasks according to the plan. In September, the entire team learned from the lessons of the past accidents with the chute affecting production, strengthened the chute maintenance work, and tried to prevent hidden accidents. In addition to implementing various maintenance systems, they also established a periodic replacement system for large and small keys, and basically eliminated coal chute accidents in September.
    On October 4, the combined coal mining machine drivers held a forum, guaranteeing to consolidate the achievements and strive to produce another 1,000 tons of coal in October.

    大同矿务局六号井联合采煤机工作面工人
    创造月产一万五千多吨的全国新纪录
    大同矿务局六号井联合采煤机工作面全体工人，九月份在欢庆全国人民代表大会会议的召开和迎接一九五四年国庆节的劳动竞赛中，创造了出煤一万五千零七十九吨的全国联合采煤机工作面月产最高新纪录。（按：以前的最高纪录是一万三千二百九十二吨）。
    九月份一开始，六号井联合采煤机工作面的工人便在七、八月份取得良好成绩的基础上，制订计划，掀起全国劳动竞赛。工人们在生产中认真贯彻了正规循环作业（从截煤、支架、放顶到将煤运出工作面叫做一个循环）。他们在收听了伟大的领袖毛泽东当选为中华人民共和国主席的消息后，于二十九日创造了日产七百零五吨的空前纪录。这个工作面全月完成了五十七个循环作业。
    竞赛中工人们提出“不浪费一分钟”的口号，开展技术革新，想尽办法缩短一切辅助工作时间。首先，联合采煤机的司机改进了机器下放操作法
  （联合采煤机是从工作面下部工作起逐渐往上走的，做完一个循环就必须把联合采煤机重新放到工作面的下部），缩短了下放机器的时间。其次，全区进一步加强了生产管理，各工种小组互相提出了保证条件，作到了紧密配合，按时完成各工种任务，这就使得九月份联合采煤机工作时间每天达到了五小时。生产中工人认真贯彻作业规程和各种制度，严格执行小组制订的制度，每一种工作都确定专人负责，在保证完成生产计划的统一行动下，工人们都自觉地按计划完成任务。九月份全组工人接受以往溜子出事故影响生产的教训，加强了溜子检修工作，想办法防止隐形事故。他们除贯彻各种检修制度外，并建立了周期更换大小键子制度，九月份便基本消灭了煤溜子事故。
    十月四日，联合采煤机司机举行了座谈会，保证巩固成绩，争取在十月份再多产一千吨煤。
