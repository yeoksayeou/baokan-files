Dear Friends:

	On your grand festival, I am very honored to represent the President, Government, and all the people of the German Democratic Republic, as well as all peace-loving, patriotic Germans, in extending to you the most heartfelt congratulations.

	Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Five years ago, after a great and arduous decades-long struggle for liberation, the Chinese people defeated domestic and foreign oppressors and took power into their own hands. This not only ushered in a victorious era for the liberation struggles of Asian nations but also greatly strengthened the forces of peace that are fighting against war. No force in the world can erase this great historical fact.

	In our homeland, which has been divided into East and West by American interventionists, peace-loving people are watching with great concern the efforts of the Chinese people to complete national reunification and expel the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique from their last hiding place, Taiwan.

	Since October 1, 1949, the Chinese people have achieved a series of brilliant successes. The restoration of China's national economy, which had suffered from war and civil war, the measures taken to transform China into a powerful industrial nation, the initial achievements of the Five-Year Plan, and the remarkably successful cultural reforms are all milestones on your path to building a socialist China. The achievements of the Chinese people through unremitting efforts and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union have shattered the U.S. imperialist policy of blockade and embargo. The strength of the Chinese people will also shatter any new attempts to discriminate against the Chinese people.

	In these days, the great achievements of the Chinese people have reached a new peak as the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China held its first session and, for the first time in Chinese history, presented a democratic constitution to the people of the whole country.

	China, once manipulated by the dirty hands of colonial robber states, has today become a powerful nation with a decisive role. The Geneva Conference clearly demonstrated that major international issues, especially those concerning Asia and the Far East, cannot be resolved without the participation of, or even against the opposition of, the People’s Republic of China. This fact, like the indestructible unity and friendship between China and the Soviet Union, has been powerfully confirmed. This also gives to all the people who are still suffering under the oppression of colonial countries the firm confidence that if they fight with the same determination, they will obtain their freedom and national independence. The German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving, patriotic Germans sincerely care about this national liberation struggle of the Asian nations.

	The German people are also fighting to re-establish the democratic unity of their country and to liberate their homeland from imperialist intervention. Not long ago, the brave French people repelled the American conspiracy to turn West Germany into a military base for a new anti-Soviet war through the so-called "European Defense Community." Patriots throughout Germany know that American war instigators and Adenauer will engage in new conspiracies to implement their anti-people plans. The people of Europe and Asia will be vigilant against these war instigators and unite more closely in the world peace camp. In Europe and Asia, what is urgently needed now is not the organization of aggressive blocs, but the establishment of collective security.

	The German people are heartily grateful to the Chinese people for their strong support in the German national liberation struggle. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people for this assistance, as well as for the enormous material aid that the Government of the German Democratic Republic has received in implementing its new policies.

	I respectfully wish the great Chinese people further victories in the cause of building a great socialist republic of peace, happiness, and prosperity.

	Long live the friendship between the German and Chinese people!

	Long live Chairman Mao Zedong of the People’s Republic of China!

	Long live our common friendship with the powerful Soviet Union!

	Long live the liberation struggle of all nations!

	Long live peace!

### 德意志民主共和国政府代表团团长  博尔茨的讲话

    德意志民主共和国政府代表团团长
    博尔茨的讲话亲爱的朋友们：
    在你们的盛大的节日，我非常荣幸地代表德意志民主共和国总统、政府和全体人民以及一切爱和平、爱祖国的德国人民向你们致最衷心的祝贺。
    明天是中华人民共和国成立五周年纪念日。五年前，中国人民经过了伟大的、艰苦的、长达数十年之久的争取解放斗争以后，战胜了国内和国外的压迫者，把政权掌握到了自己手里，这样不仅开辟了亚洲各民族解放斗争的胜利的时代，并且同时也大大地增强了正在和战争作着斗争的和平力量。世界上没有任何一种力量能够抹杀这一伟大的历史事实。
    在我们的被美国干涉者分裂为东部和西部的祖国里，爱好和平的人们正以极大的关怀注视着中国人民为完成全国统一和把蒋介石卖国集团从他们最后的藏身之地——台湾驱逐出去所作的努力。
    从一九四九年十月一日以来，中国人民已经取得了一系列的光辉成就。遭受过战争和内战摧残的中国国民经济的重新恢复，为把中国变为强大的工业国而采取的各项措施，五年计划的初步成就以及成绩卓著的文化改革，这一切都是你们在建设一个社会主义中国的道路上的里程碑。中国人民在坚忍不拔的努力中，在苏联的大公无私的援助下所取得的成就已经粉碎了美帝国主义的封锁禁运政策。中国人民的力量也将粉碎任何一种歧视中国人民的新的企图。
    在这几天里，当中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会举行了第一次会议并且在中国历史上第一次把一部民主的宪法交给了全国人民的时候，中国人民的伟大成就达到了一个新的高峰。
    中国，曾经受到殖民强盗国家肮脏的手的摆布，今天已经成为具有决定性作用的强大的国家了。日内瓦会议清楚地说明了，如果没有中华人民共和国参加，或甚至反对中华人民共和国的话，重大的国际问题，尤其是亚洲和远东的问题，是解决不了的。这一事实，正像中国和苏联的团结和友好之不可摧毁一样，已被有力地证实了。这也给一切还在殖民国家的压迫下受着痛苦的人民以这种坚强的信心：如果他们用同样的决心进行斗争的话，他们将得到他们的自由和民族独立。德意志民主共和国和一切爱和平、爱祖国的德国人民真诚地关怀着亚洲各民族的这种民族解放斗争。
    德国人民也正在为了重新建立他们国家的民主统一和从帝国主义干涉下解放他们的祖国而斗争着。不久之前，勇敢的法国人民打退了美国想通过所谓“欧洲防务集团”把西德变成进行新的反苏战争的军事基地的阴谋。全德国的爱国者都知道，美国战争挑拨者和阿登纳为了实行他们的反人民的计划是会从事新的阴谋的。欧洲和亚洲人民将会对这些战争挑拨者提高警惕并在世界和平阵营中更加紧密地团结起来。在欧洲和亚洲，目前刻不容缓的不是组织侵略集团，而是建立集体安全。
    德国人民衷心感谢中国人民在德国民族解放斗争中所给予的大力支持。我借此机会为这种帮助，以及为了德意志民主共和国政府在实施新方针时所获得的巨大物质援助，向中华人民共和国政府和中国人民表示感谢。
    我敬祝伟大的中国人民在建设一个和平、幸福和繁荣的伟大的社会主义共和国的事业中获得进一步的胜利。
    德国和中国人民的友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国主席毛泽东万岁！
    我们和强大苏联的共同友谊万岁！
    各民族的解放斗争万岁！
    和平万岁！
