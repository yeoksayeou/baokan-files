Heilongjiang Province has comprehensively launched its autumn forest fire prevention work. The firebreaks on both sides of the railway in major forest areas such as Shangzhi, Yichun, Hailin, and Mishan have been basically completed. The Friendship, Tonghe, and Nancha Forestry Bureaus and mining departments have also made arrangements and inspections for forest fire prevention. Remote areas such as Luobei and Heihe have also established a system of responsibility by section and area based on local conditions. In order to strengthen the leadership and inspection of autumn forest fire prevention work, the province has established a forest fire prevention headquarters and organized eight working groups in early October to go to major forest area counties such as Yichun and Tonghe to conduct inspections and assist local areas in carrying out autumn forest fire prevention work.

Farmers in the forest areas of Fujian are opening up mountains and clearing grass to prepare for large-scale timber forest construction next spring. More than 51,000 mu of grass have been cleared in various counties of the Nanping Special Zone. Farmers in various places in the Jianyang Special Zone have recently launched a competition for opening mountains and clearing grass, striving to complete all autumn and winter grass clearing plans around mid-October.

Clearing grass and burning mountains is an important step in the construction of timber forests such as Chinese fir in southern forest areas, which can make the forest land fertile, the soil loose, and facilitate the survival and growth of seedlings. Next year, Fujian Province will construct more than 1.13 million mu of construction timber forests, oil tea forests, and protective forests in the Minjiang, Jiulongjiang, and Tingjiang river basins and coastal areas, of which timber forests such as Chinese fir and eucalyptus account for more than 530,000 mu, an expansion of more than two times the timber forest construction area this year.

    黑龙江省全面开展秋季护林防火工作
    福建省林区农民劈草炼山准备明年春季造林
    黑龙江省秋季护林防火工作已全面展开。尚志、伊春、海林、密山等主要林区铁路两旁防火线已基本打完，友好、通河、南岔等森林工业局和矿务部门对护林防火工作也做了布置和检查，偏远地区的萝北、黑河等地也根据当地情况建立了分段分片负责制。为了加强秋季护林防火工作的领导和检查，该省成立了护林防火指挥部，并于十月上旬组织了八个工作组，分赴伊春、通河等主要林区县份进行检查，协助各地开展秋季护林防火工作。（白桦）
    福建林区的农民正在开山劈草，为明年春季大量营造用材林做好准备。南平专区各县已劈草五万一千多亩。建阳专区各地农民近来并开展开山劈草竞赛，争取在十月中旬左右全部完成秋、冬季劈草计划。
    劈草炼山是南方林区营造杉木等用材林的重要步骤，可使林地肥沃、土质松软，易于苗木成活和生长。福建省明年将在闽江、九龙江、汀江流域和沿海各地营造建设用材林、油茶林和防护林等一百十三万多亩，其中杉树、桉树等用材林占五十三万多亩，比今年用材林营造面积扩大两倍多。
