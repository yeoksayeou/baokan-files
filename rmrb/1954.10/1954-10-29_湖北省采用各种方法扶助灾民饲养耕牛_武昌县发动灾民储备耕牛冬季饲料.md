    Hubei Province is vigorously assisting farmers in disaster areas to protect draft cattle and making preparations for draft cattle to survive the winter. Jianli and Honghu counties organized more than 7,000 herdsmen and more than 90 cadres to help disaster-stricken people raise draft cattle. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Hubei Provincial People's Government specially allocated 5 billion yuan to assist disaster-stricken people in raising draft cattle. As the weather gradually turns cold, many county people's government construction sections, agricultural technology promotion stations, and local farmers are studying and storing feed, strengthening the prevention and control of draft cattle diseases, repairing livestock sheds, and other methods to protect draft cattle through the winter; some are also helping them summarize past experiences in feeding draft cattle. Hanchuan, Hanyang, Puqi and other counties have begun to organize farmers to salvage artemisia from the lakes, dry it, crush it, and store it for draft cattle to eat in winter. In order to prevent and control draft cattle diseases, Hubei Province has trained more than 850 veterinarians this year, plus more than 7,000 veterinarians trained in previous years. Under the leadership of the local people's government, they are actively preventing and controlling diseases in draft cattle. In Huangmei County, some draft cattle were sick due to malnutrition after the flood, but most of them recovered after emergency treatment. Now, farmers in disaster areas are actively collecting branches and reeds to build livestock sheds. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups are also planning to build collective cattle sheds, which can save materials and improve feeding management.

    The mobilization of disaster-stricken people in Wuchang County, Hubei Province, to store winter feed for draft cattle has achieved remarkable results. This year, more than 100 townships in the county were affected by floods, and 28,000 draft cattle lacked winter feed. After the flood receded, the Wuchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Government actively educated the disaster-stricken people, making them realize the importance of protecting draft cattle through the winter. Under the leadership of the Party branches in various townships, farmers were mobilized to come up with many ways to find substitutes for winter feed for draft cattle. Fanhuzhen Township found 18 kinds of feed substitutes, which can replace 270,000 jin of forage. Xiong Yudong and other seven mutual aid groups in Tongyi Township organized 12 boats and more than 100 laborers to haul more than 1,400 dan of lake grass and more than 400 dan of artemisia in the lake in four days. In addition to solving the winter feed for 21 cattle in the seven mutual aid groups, they also accumulated more than 200 dan of grass fertilizer. After the flood receded, the Baihu Township Branch of the Communist Party of China mobilized the masses to grow more radishes, peas, broad beans, rapeseed and other crops that can be eaten by humans and animals, which can increase feed by more than 60,000 jin this winter and next spring. Luoji Township in the Seventh District organized 15 cattle herding groups to graze on the mountains to save feed.
    Farmers in non-disaster areas of the county also promoted the spirit of class friendship, saving feed to support farmers in disaster areas. Farmers in Gaobei Township saved 22,000 jin of feed from making straw sandals, burning firewood, and smoking earthen bricks, and sold it to farmers in disaster areas at a fair price. The financial and economic departments and cooperative departments of Wuchang County also purchased surplus rice straw and other feed from non-disaster areas and supplied them to disaster areas.
    Currently, disaster-stricken people in the county are still actively collecting feed for draft cattle. They have established confidence in protecting draft cattle through the winter.

    湖北省采用各种方法扶助灾民饲养耕牛
    武昌县发动灾民储备耕牛冬季饲料
    湖北省大力扶助灾区农民保护耕牛并做好耕牛过冬的准备工作。监利、洪湖两县组织了七千多牧民、九十多个干部帮助灾民饲养耕牛。湖北省人民政府财政经济委员会特拨出五十亿元，扶助灾民饲养耕牛。随着天气日渐寒冷，许多县人民政府建设科、农业技术推广站和当地农民研究储备饲料，加强耕牛疾病防治、修补畜舍等保护耕牛过冬的办法；有的并帮助他们总结了以往喂养耕牛的经验。汉川、汉阳、蒲圻等县已开始组织农民到湖里打捞蒿草，晒干轧细，储备作为耕牛过冬食用。为防治耕牛疾病，湖北省今年训练了八百五十多名兽医，加上前几年训练的共有七千多名兽医，他们在当地人民政府领导下，正积极给耕牛防治疾病。黄梅县的耕牛由于大水过后饲养失调，有些耕牛有病，经抢治后大部都好了。现在受灾地区的农民，正积极采集树枝、芦苇架造畜棚。许多农业生产合作社、互助组并计划搭建集体牛棚，既可节省材料，又能改进饲养管理。　　　　　（据新华社讯）

    湖北省武昌县发动灾民储备耕牛过冬饲料，取得显著成绩。今年，该县有一百多个乡遭受水灾，二万八千头耕牛缺乏过冬饲料。水退后，中共武昌县委会和县人民政府即积极对灾民进行教育，使灾民认识到保护耕牛过冬的重要性，在各乡党支部领导下，发动农民想出很多办法，寻找耕牛过冬饲料的代用品。范湖乡找出的饲料代用品有十八种，可以代替二十七万斤草料。同意乡熊玉东等七个互助组组织了十二只船、一百多个劳动力，四天功夫，在湖内绞了一千四百多担湖草，四百多担蒿草。除了解决七个互助组二十一头牛的过冬饲料外，还积了二百多担草肥。中共白湖乡支部在水退之后，又发动群众多种人畜可食的萝卜、豌豆、蚕豆，油菜等作物，在今冬明春，可增加饲料六万多斤。七区罗集乡组织十五个放牛小组，在山上放牧，以节省饲料。
    该县非灾区的农民也发扬阶级友爱的精神，节约饲料支援灾区农民。高碑乡农民从打草鞋、烧火、薰土砖等方面，节约饲料二万二千斤，以公平价格卖给灾区农民。武昌县的财经、合作部门也从非灾区采购多余的稻草及其他饲料，到灾区供应。
    现在，该县灾民仍积极进行采集耕牛饲料的活动。他们对保护耕牛过冬已树立了信心。
