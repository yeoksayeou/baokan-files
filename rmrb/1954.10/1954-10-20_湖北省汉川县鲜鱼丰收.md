    Fresh Fish Abundant in Hanchuan County, Hubei Province
    Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, has had a bumper harvest of fresh fish. The output of fresh fish in September reached more than 1.5 million jin. Currently, more than 60,000 fishermen and more than 30,000 fishing boats in the county are catching fresh fish day and night on more than 30 lakes and more than 150 kilometers of the Han River.
    Before the fishing season's bumper harvest, the Hanchuan County People's Government issued a total of 280 million yuan in fishery loans to help poor fishermen and disaster victims overcome the difficulties encountered in adding to and repairing fishing gear. The Hanchuan County local state-owned agricultural tool factory also allocated some manpower to rush to produce fishing boats to meet the needs of fishermen.
    The abundant harvest of fresh fish has increased the income of fishermen and disaster victims and solved the current livelihood problems. Fishermen and disaster victims in the ninth district, accounting for 25 percent of the total population of the district, rely on fishing to solve their livelihood problems. Lin Luo's mother and daughter in Wangyang Township had difficulties in life after the flood, but now they have received a loan of 50,000 yuan, added fishing gear, and joined a mutual aid group, and their lives can be maintained.
    Fishery production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have also fully demonstrated their superiority in fishing. The fishery production cooperative in Zhangma Township has ten boats fishing every day, and they earn more than 64,000 yuan more than the same number of boats of individual fishermen.
    At present, the weather is gradually getting colder, and the water level is receding, which is the peak season for fishing. In order to cooperate with the abundant harvest of fresh fish, the Hanchuan County aquatic products, cooperative, and trade departments are stepping up the work of purchasing, transporting, and processing.

    湖北省汉川县鲜鱼丰收
    湖北省汉川县鲜鱼丰收。九月份鲜鱼产量已达一百五十余万斤。现全县六万多渔民，三万多只鱼船，在三十多个湖泊和一百五十多公里长的汉江水面上，日夜捞捕鲜鱼。
    汉川县人民政府在渔季丰收之前，为了帮助贫苦的渔民和灾民克服在添置和修补渔具中所遇到的困难，共发放二亿八千万元渔业贷款。汉川县地方国营农具厂也抽出一部分力量赶制渔船，供应渔民需要。
    鲜鱼丰收，给渔民和灾民增加了收入，解决了当前的生活问题。九区占全区总人口百分之二十五的渔民和灾民，就靠捕鱼解决了生活问题。汪洋乡林罗氏母女二人在水灾后生活困难，现在她们得到五万元贷款，添置了渔具，又参加了互助组，生活已可以维持。
    渔业生产合作社和互助组，在捕鱼中也充分显示出优越性。张马乡的渔业生产合作社，每天有十只船捕鱼，都比单干渔民同样数量的船只，多收入六万四千余元。
    目前，天气渐冷，水势日退，正是捕鱼的旺季。汉川县水产、合作、贸易部门为了配合鲜鱼丰收，正加紧进行收购、运销、加工等工作。（邹正宜）
