    Ten Percent Cotton, Ten Percent Harvest
    ——A Record of Fine Harvesting and Picking by the Gongjiawa Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter: Zhang Hua, Fang Chen, Rong Tai
    In the cotton fields of the Gongjiawa Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nangong County, Hebei Province, cotton bolls are bursting with snow-white cotton fibers. According to the calculations of each production team, the 1,574 mu of dryland cotton in the whole cooperative can produce an average of 160 jin per mu. Just as the cotton harvest was predicted to be bountiful, the members heard that the state was going to establish a tractor station in Gongjiawa. Everyone was overjoyed. Songs and laughter filled the village and the cotton fields. As the large cotton fields became more and more full of cotton, the members were planning to pick the "first flush" when the instructions for fine harvesting and careful picking came to the cooperative. More than fifty old members of the cooperative couldn't help but think of the scene at the end of last autumn: the "eye hair" (broken cotton petals and cotton fibers left in the cotton shells), stiff petals, and fallen cotton in the 500 mu of cotton fields. The members hastily picked it up for three days and brought back more than 3,000 jin. Among them, some were originally good cotton, but because they were not picked up in time, they were buried in the soil and rusted by the rain, and each jin was only worth 700 yuan. This year, everyone is determined to achieve fine harvesting and careful picking, and not let a single thread or petal be lost. However, many of the more than 100 new members who joined the cooperative this year found it troublesome, believing that it was inevitable that something would be wasted when planting, and that losing a little "eye hair" was nothing. In response to this kind of thinking, the cooperative held a meeting. The director calculated for everyone, saying: "From picking the first flush to pulling the cotton stalks, it's not too much to leave one 'eye hair' on a cotton plant. But there are more than 3,000 cotton plants per mu, and losing more than 3,000 'eye hairs' is one jin. This year, if we guarantee not to lose 'eye hair,' we can harvest more than 1,500 jin of cotton from more than 1,500 mu of cotton. This 1,500 jin of cotton is not much in the whole of China, but our large factories are built up by accumulating these many small things." The members realized the principle of accumulating small amounts to make a large amount, and realized that fine harvesting and careful picking is a concrete action to support industrialization, and said: The rice in the bowl can no longer be spilled. Therefore, everyone made new methods for picking cotton: dividing the land and ridges with individual responsibility; not leaving "eye hair," and collecting stiff petals and good flowers separately; picking up fallen cotton cleanly, and picking out cotton leaves cleanly. The cooperative also stipulated reward methods and sent cotton picking technicians to the field to guide and inspect.
    The first flush began to be picked. "Fine harvesting and careful picking, increasing income" became the goal of 229 female members of the eight teams. More than 20 Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in each team became leading backbones. Gong Lancun, a Communist Youth League member of the third team, finished her meal and went to the house to call people, urging them to go to the field on time. When dividing the land and ridges, she never picked and chose, but slowly and carefully picked, constantly reminding others not to leave "eye hair" and to pick out stiff petals cleanly. Under the leadership of the backbone members, each team member followed the cotton ridge they were assigned, bent down and gently picked with both hands, leaving the picked flower land clean ridge by ridge. Middle-aged and elderly women were not lagging behind either. Zhao Jinfeng, a 55-year-old woman from the fifth team, arrived earlier than anyone else when gathering, and walked faster than the young people when going to the field. She bent over and buried her head in the cotton ridge. When she encountered "eye hair," she held the cotton boll shell with one hand and picked it clean with the other. When people's backs were sore and tired, they sat on the edge of the field to rest, and Zhao Jinfeng would perform the yangko and sing ditties to make everyone laugh and forget their fatigue. She said: "As soon as I see these large cotton flowers, and think that we can use tractors this year, my back doesn't hurt, my hands don't hurt, and my whole body is full of energy." She used her own experience of turning over a new leaf to educate the young people. She said: "In the past, we were exploited by the landlords. Picking flowers for the landlords for a day only earned seven or eight copper coins, which couldn't even buy a sheng of grain. The landlord ate, and I fought the dog's teeth (in the past, she went to the landlord's house to beg for food and was often bitten by the landlord's dog, so she had to use a stick to fight the dog and retreat out of the door). Aunts and grandmas called out loud, but they couldn't get a mouthful of leftovers. Since the Communist Party came, I have land and houses. Last year, I joined the cooperative and used mules and horses. This year, I will use tractors to plant wheat. In another ten years, we will pick cotton by car." The exemplary deeds of these activists were introduced to each group by the inspectors, and those who only cared about picking more flowers for themselves but did not pick cleanly were also educated. Fifteen of the sixteen cotton picking groups in the whole cooperative achieved the quality of cotton picking and were praised by the cooperative.
    The people of the Gongjiawa Agricultural Production Cooperative did not work in vain. In the first flush, they picked more than 3,000 jin of stiff petals and tore back at least 200 jin of "eye hair." Because the picking was clean and of high quality, each jin sold for 300 yuan more than other people's cotton. The members saw the benefits of fine harvesting and careful picking with their own eyes, and everyone beamed with joy. Each group automatically gathered to summarize experience, check shortcomings, and determined not to lose a single thread of cotton, to achieve a ten percent harvest in a ten percent year.

    十成棉花十成收
    ——记巩家洼农业生产合作社精收细摘
    新华社记者　张华　方辰　荣泰
    河北省南宫县巩家洼农业生产合作社的棉田里，棉桃喷吐出雪白的棉絮。根据各生产队数桃算账结果，全社一千五百七十四亩旱地棉花，平均每亩能产一百六十斤。正在棉花预报丰收的时候，社员们又听说国家要在巩家洼建立拖拉机站。大家喜上加喜，村庄里，棉田上，洋溢着歌声和笑声。连成一片的大块棉田里棉朵一天一天多起来了，社员们正合计着采摘“头喷花”，精收细摘的指示传到社里来。全社五十多户老社员不由地想起了去年秋末的情景：五百亩棉田里的“眼毛”（棉壳里丢下的破棉瓣、棉丝）、僵瓣和落地棉花，社员们草草拾了三天，就拾回来三千多斤。其中有好些本来是好棉花，因为没及时拾，被土埋雨锈每斤只值七百元。今年大家下定决心作到精收细摘，一丝一瓣也不让它损失。但今年新入社的一百多户社员中不少人嫌麻烦，认为种什么就免不了糟蹋什么，丢点“眼毛”，一星半点的算个啥。社里针对这种思想情况召开会议，社长替大家计算说：“从摘头喷花到拔棉花秸，一棵棉花上留一个‘眼毛’不算多。但是一亩地有三千多棵棉花，丢三千多个‘眼毛’就有一斤重。今年如果保证不丢‘眼毛’，一千五百多亩棉花就能多收一千五百多斤棉花。这一千五百多斤棉花放在全中国不算多，但咱们的大工厂就是靠这许多一星半点的东西积蓄起来的。”社员们认识到积少成多的道理，认识到精收细摘就是支援工业化的具体行动，都说：饭盛在碗里不能再撒了。于是，大家订出摘棉花的新办法：分地分垅个人负责；不留“眼毛”，僵瓣、好花分别收；拾净落地棉花，拣净棉花叶。社里也规定了奖励办法，并派摘棉技术员下地指导和检查。
    头喷花开始采摘了。“精收细摘，增加收入”成了八个队二百二十九个女社员的奋斗目标。各队二十多个共产党员、青年团员成了带头的骨干。第三队的青年团员巩兰存，不等集合她先吃完饭上房去喊人，催促人们按时下地。分地分垅时，她从不挑拣，慢慢地细心采摘，随时提醒别人不要留“眼毛”，拣净僵瓣。在骨干分子的带动下，个个队员都按照自己分的棉垅、弯下腰去双手轻轻地摘，摘过的花地垅垅干净。中年、老年妇女也不落后。第五队有个五十五岁的老大娘赵金凤，集合时比谁都到的早下地的时候比青年走的还快。她弯着腰把头埋在棉垅里，遇上“眼毛”，便一手拿住棉桃壳，
  一手摘净为止。人们的腰弯得酸疼了，坐在地头上休息，赵金凤就扭秧歌、唱小曲逗的大家嘻嘻哈哈地忘记了疲劳。她说：“一看见这大朵的棉花，一想起今年就能使上拖拉机，腰也不酸了，手也不痛了，满身长劲。”她用她翻身的事实教育青年们，她说：“过去咱受地主剥削，给地主摘一天花，只挣七、八个大铜子（铜币），连一升粮食也买不了。地主吃饭，我打狗牙（过去她到地主家要饭吃，经常被地主的狗咬，她只好用棍打着狗退出门去），婶子大娘连声叫，也要不出一口剩饭来。自从来了共产党，我有了地有了房，去年入了社，使上骡马，今年种麦子就使拖拉机，再过十几年咱们来摘棉花就坐汽车了。”这些积极分子的模范事迹，被检查员介绍到各组，个别只顾自己多摘花而收摘不净的人也受到了教育。全社十六个摘棉小组，十五个组都达到了摘棉的质量，受到社里的表扬。
      巩家洼农业生产合作社的人们没有白费劲，头喷花就多摘了三千多斤僵瓣，多撕回来的“眼毛”顶少也有二百斤。因为摘的净质量高，每斤还比别人的棉花多卖三百元。社员们亲眼看到精收细摘的好处，个个喜的眉开眼笑。各组自动集会，总结经验，检查缺点，决心不丢一丝棉，作到十成年景十成收。
