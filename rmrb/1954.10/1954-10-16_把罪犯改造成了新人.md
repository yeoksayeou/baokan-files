    Criminals Transformed into New People
    Ji Ren
    In recent years, the work of reforming criminals through labor across the country has achieved remarkable results. After labor reform, most criminals have gradually recognized their crimes and are willing to repent and start anew. Those who did not have labor habits have begun to develop them; those who did not have production skills have learned certain skills; and illiterates have also learned to read. At present, most labor reform units have achieved self-sufficiency, saving the state's financial expenditures. Some labor reform production units have even accumulated funds to expand production, creating a certain amount of wealth for the country.
    Labor reform production has grown from small to large, from decentralized to centralized, and now has a considerable scale, playing a certain role in supporting the country's economic construction.
    Labor reform units engaged in agricultural production have established a number of large-scale farms, some of which have implemented semi-mechanized farming. Some farms have achieved higher yields. For example, the rice planted by the Qinghe Farm in Beijing has an average yield of 741 jin per mu, exceeding the local farmers' yield by 54%; the high-yield fields of the Guanghan Farm in Sichuan Province have an average yield of 851 jin of wheat per mu. Some farms have also developed animal husbandry such as raising pigs, sheep, and cattle in conjunction with agriculture. Labor reform farms across the country have played a certain role in supporting the country's industrial construction.
    Labor reform production not only engages in agriculture, but also in some industrial, mining, and kiln production, to a certain extent supporting the country's basic construction and supplying the people with some daily necessities. The hollow bricks produced by a labor reform unit in a certain area supplied the needs of urban construction. The Beijing Prison Sock Factory produced socks in 1953, accounting for 32% of the output in North China. The reclaimed rubber and steel ingot molds produced by a labor reform factory in Shenyang are of relatively good quality. Various labor reform engineering teams, such as the engineering team participating in the Huai River harnessing project and the road construction engineering team participating in the Tianlan Railway, have been praised by the engineering bureau several times because the projects they built met the standards.
    In labor production, the labor reform organs, in accordance with the policy of combining punishment with education, have focused on conducting a series of political and ideological education for prisoners. Except for a small number of incorrigible elements who continue to engage in destructive activities and have been severely punished, the vast majority of prisoners have been reformed to varying degrees. They have not only gradually improved their enthusiasm for labor production, but many have also continued to confess the crimes they concealed during the trial and actively provided some valuable materials, enabling the people's public security organs to successfully solve some criminal cases. According to incomplete statistics from nine provinces including Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hebei, and the former Liaoxi, labor reform prisoners in these areas confessed and reported clues about hiding 2,503 rifles and pistols, 34,276 rounds of ammunition, and 33,182 pieces of other case clues during the winter training in 1953. After investigation, most of these clues were confirmed, which helped the implementation of various social reform movements. Especially after organizing prisoners to study the general task of the country's transition period last winter and this spring, the prisoners' awareness of making a new start was further enlightened. Many prisoners took the initiative to write letters to mobilize their families to participate in socialist construction. Su Changyue, a prisoner at the Qiaosi Farm in Zhejiang, wrote a letter to his family, urging them to sell 3,600 jin of surplus grain to the state. From the perspective of labor attitude, most prisoners have changed from forced labor to voluntary labor, and have learned certain production technologies. According to the assessment statistics of the No. 1 Prison in Shenyang, 90% of the prisoners have a good labor attitude, and 74.3% have reached the basic worker standard in production technology. The production enthusiasm of many prisoners has been continuously improved, and they have also made many inventions and creations. In the labor reform production enterprises in Tianjin Prison, prisoners put forward 934 rationalization proposals in the May competition last year, which were studied and integrated into more than 20 practical operating procedures, increasing the value of wealth for the country by 800 million yuan. In the former Liaoxi Province last year, there were 67 inventions and creations in labor reform production, increasing the wealth of the country by more than 2.19 billion yuan per month. The labor reform brick and tile factory in Hebei Province created the "sparse code long burning brick method," which increased the daily output from 80,000 bricks to 155,000 bricks, which can increase the wealth of the country by 4.7 billion yuan a year, and can reach 23 billion yuan after being promoted throughout the province.
    Labor reform organs have also carried out literacy work among criminals. Many prisoners who were originally illiterate are now able to write ordinary letters. In the No. 1 Labor Reform Brigade directly under Hebei Province, one-third of the illiterate people have learned 1,500 characters, and the rest of the prisoners can also recognize about 900 characters. Liu Changshan, a prisoner in a labor reform team in Shanxi Province, said in a letter to his brother: "The government not only reforms us through labor, but also teaches us culture. I have never been to school before, but now I know more than 2,000 characters, can keep accounts, and can write letters." Many prisoners who originally suffered from chronic diseases have had their illnesses cured by the labor reform organs. Zhu Shiqi, a prisoner in Shanghai, wrote in a letter to the labor reform organ: "I suffered from a perforated stomach, which has never been cured. The People's Government not only reformed my thinking, but also cured my stomach disease and saved the lives of my whole family."
    After criminals have undergone labor reform and their sentences have expired, they have asked to stay in the team to continue production. Labor reform organs in various places have approved them to continue to stay in the team to produce based on the voluntary applications of the released prisoners. Those who are willing to return to their hometowns to produce are allowed to return to their hometowns to produce. Most of these released prisoners are able to abide by the law and actively participate in labor production. Li Xifeng, a criminal offender in Jiangxi Province, was very active in production after being released and was elected as a labor model. Wang Wanshun, a prisoner in Jiaozhou, Shandong Province, joined a mutual aid group after being released and worked very actively. The masses reflected: "The government really has a way to transform people who don't work into good workers!" Wang Changsheng, a prisoner in the No. 1 Brigade directly under Hunan Province, met an escaped prisoner, Li Hesheng, when he was selling vegetables in Changsha after being released. He immediately caught Li and sent him to the People's Public Security Organ. On the way, Li bribed him with more than 100,000 yuan, but he refused. Many prisoners' families wrote letters to thank the government. Zhou Weixian, the wife of Tao Jie, a prisoner in Shanghai, wrote a letter saying: "The People's Government has reformed my husband and brought happiness to my whole family." Many foreign friends praised the humanitarian spirit of the new China towards prisoners after visiting the labor reform production in our country's prisons. The chairman of the Japan-China Trade Committee said after visiting the Beijing Prison: "Today I deeply realized the fundamental difference between the old and new prisons, and realized that you are taking the policy of reforming and educating criminals." A representative from Sweden said: "This kind of treatment of prisoners does not exist in capitalist countries. This is the most correct and humane way to treat prisoners."

    把罪犯改造成了新人
    吉人
    最近几年来，全国劳动改造罪犯的工作已经获得了显著的成效。罪犯经过劳动改造，大都逐步认识到他们的罪恶，愿意悔过自新。没有劳动习惯的已开始养成了劳动习惯；没有生产技能的已学到了一定的技能；文盲也学到了文化。现在大部分的劳动改造单位已经做到了自给，节省了国家的财政开支，有的劳动改造生产单位还积累了资金，扩大了生产，为国家创造了一定的财富。
    劳动改造的生产从小到大，从分散到集中，现在已经有了相当的规模，在配合国家经济建设上起了一定的作用。
    从事农业生产的劳动改造单位已经建立了一些大型农场，其中有的已实行了半机械化的耕作。有的农场获得了较高额的产量。如北京市清河农场种植的水稻，每亩平均产量达七百四十一斤，超过当地农民产量的百分之五十四；四川省广汉农场的丰产田每亩平均产小麦八百五十一斤。有的农场还结合农业发展了饲养猪、羊、牛等畜牧业。全国各地劳动改造农场，对支援国家工业建设起了一定的作用。
    劳动改造生产不仅经营农业，而且还从事部分工、矿、窑业生产，在一定程度上配合了国家的基本建设，供应了人民部分生活资料。某地劳动改造单位生产的空心砖，供应了都市的建设需用。北京监狱袜厂，一九五三年生产的袜子，占华北区产量的百分之三十二。沈阳某劳动改造工厂生产的再生胶、钢锭模的质量都比较好。各种劳动改造工程队，如参加治淮的工程队、参加天兰铁路的筑路工程队，因为兴修的工程合乎标准，因而有的劳动改造工程队曾数次获得工程局的表扬。
    在劳动生产中，劳动改造机关根据惩办和教育相结合的方针，抓紧对犯人进行了一系列的政治、思想教育，除少数怙恶不悛、屡教不改、继续进行破坏活动的分子已被从严惩处外，已使绝大多数犯人得到了不同程度的改造。他们不仅劳动生产情绪逐渐提高，而且不少人还继续坦白供认了审讯期间隐瞒的罪恶，主动提供了一些有价值的材料，使人民公安机关得以顺利地破获了一些犯罪案件。根据陕西、江西、山东、河北、前辽西等九个省的不完全统计，这些地方的劳动改造犯人在一九五三年冬训中就坦白和检举出藏匿长短枪二千五百零三支、子弹三万四千二百七十六发的线索，其他案件的线索材料三万三千一百八十二份。这些线索经过调查后绝大部分得到证实，配合了各种社会改革运动。特别是去冬今春组织犯人学习国家过渡时期总任务后，进一步启发了犯人重新作人的自觉性。不少犯人主动写信动员家属参加社会主义建设。浙江乔司农场犯人苏长岳给家里写信，动员家人把三千六百斤余粮卖给国家。从劳动态度上看，一般犯人都已从强迫的劳动变成了自愿的劳动，并且学会了一定的生产技术。根据沈阳市第一监狱的考核统计，犯人中劳动态度较好的占百分之九十，生产技术达到基本工标准的有百分之七十四点三。不少犯人的生产积极性不断提高，并且有了不少发明创造。天津市监狱的劳动改造生产企业在去年五月竞赛中，犯人提出了九百三十四件合理化建议，经研究综合成为二十多项切实可行的操作规程，多为国家增产价值八亿元的财富。前辽西省去年劳动改造生产中的发明创造有六十七件，每个月为国家增加财富二十一亿九千余万元。河北省的劳动改造砖瓦厂创造了“稀码长烧砖法”，由日产八万块砖提高到十五万五千块，一年可为国家增加财富四十七亿元，推广全省后可达二百三十亿元。
    劳动改造机关还在罪犯中进行了扫盲工作，不少原来是文盲的犯人已经能写普通信了。在河北省直属第一劳动改造大队中的文盲，有三分之一已学会了一千五百个字，其余的犯人也都能认识九百字左右。山西省某劳动改造队犯人刘常山在写给他哥哥的信中说：“政府对我们不光是劳动改造，还教文化，我过去没有进过学校，现在已识两千多字，可以记账，可以写信了。”许多原来患有慢性病的犯人，劳动改造机关为他们医治好了病。上海市犯人朱士启写给劳动改造机关的信上说：“我患了胃穿孔，历来从未治愈，人民政府不仅改造了我的思想，而且治好了我的胃病，救了我全家性命。”
    罪犯经过劳动改造刑期届满后，纷纷要求留队生产。各地劳动改造机关多根据刑满犯人的自愿申请，批准他们继续留队生产。愿意回乡生产的就准许他回乡生产。这些刑满释放的犯人中，绝大部分都能够遵守法律，积极参加劳动生产。江西省刑事犯李喜丰被释放后，生产很积极，当选为劳动模范。山东省胶州犯人王万顺被释放后，回家参加了互助组，劳动很积极。群众反映：“政府真有办法，把不劳动的人改造成劳动的好手了！”湖南省直属第一大队犯人王长生被释放后在长沙卖菜时，遇见逃犯李和生，他立即将李犯捉住，送交人民公安机关。途中，李犯向他贿赂十几万元，遭到他的拒绝。不少犯人的家属写信感谢政府。上海市犯人陶洁的妻子周薇仙写信说：“人民政府改造好了我的丈夫，给我全家带来了幸福。”许多外国来的朋友在参观我国监狱的劳动改造生产后，都称赞新中国对犯人的人道主义精神。日本日中贸易委员会主席参观北京监狱后说：“今天使我深深体会到新旧监狱的根本不同，认识到你们对罪犯是改造教育的方针。”瑞典来的一位代表说：“在资本主义国家里，这样对待犯人是没有的，这是极正确的和最人道的对待犯人的方法。”
