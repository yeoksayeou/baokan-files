French Federal Forces in Central-Southern Vietnam's Fifth Interzone Assembly Area
Continuously Arrest and Massacre Patriotic People Who Participated in the War of Resistance
　　The French Side Also Airdrops Paratroopers in the Northern Laos Assembly Area, Conspiring to Create a Tense Situation
【Xinhua News Agency, Twenty-seventh Dispatch】According to a report from Vietnam News Agency, Central Vietnam, dated the 24th: The French Federal Forces in the Fifth Interzone assembly area in Central-Southern Vietnam are retaliating against people who actively participated in the war of resistance. Incidents of arresting and massacring these patriotic people are constantly increasing.
　　According to incomplete statistics, in three counties of Phu Yen Province, more than 400 people have been arrested simply for participating in the patriotic war against foreign aggression. In Xuan Tho village, the French Federal Forces lured people by showing movies, thereby arresting 60 young people and former resistance cadres. In Lo Hai, the French Federal Forces issued a curfew, followed by the arrest of 135 young people on October 6. Before the inspection team investigating the French side's massacre of civilians arrived in late September, the French Federal Forces concentrated the residents of Yinshan Village in one place and took away 35 of them. The French Federal Forces arrested lawyer Le Van Thanh of Phu Yen Province, stabbed him severely on the night of September 21, and shot him several times in the back. Many detainees died under torture. Many others were taken away after being tortured and have never been heard from again.
　　Despite strong protests from the Vietnam People's Army representatives in the Fifth Interzone Joint Ceasefire Commission, these acts of terror by the French Federal Forces in the Fifth Interzone assembly area have continued to occur recently. The High Command of the French Federal Forces must immediately stop all atrocities and violations of the armistice agreement, and the High Command of the French Federal Forces should bear full responsibility for this despicable retaliatory action.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, Twenty-sixth Dispatch】According to a report from Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, dated the 23rd: A special dispatch from Laos reported: Between August 23rd and 30th, the French Federal Forces in Laos airdropped 78 officers and soldiers and 64 parachutes of weapons and food at Bang Nou Airport in Phongsaly Province, Northern Laos. After landing, these paratroopers proceeded to occupy two hilltops 200 meters from Bang Nou Airport. Subsequently, they launched attacks on neighboring areas, forced local residents to build fortifications on the mountains for them. They also forcibly conscripted Laotian youths into the army, looted people's property, and prohibited residents from farming.
　　The French side's airdropping of paratroopers into the assembly area of the Laotian fighting forces (Phongsaly Province is the assembly area of the Laotian fighting forces) is a conspiracy to create a tense situation, thereby creating difficulties for the future resolution of the political problems in Laos. Therefore, this hostile action by the French side seriously violates the Geneva Accords and the terms reached by both sides in Khang Khay.
　　The Lao fighting forces and the delegation of Vietnamese volunteers have requested the International Supervisory and Control Commission to send an inspection team to Bang Nou to conduct an investigation since last week. At the same time, the people of Bang Nou have written to the Lao Joint Ceasefire Commission, protesting the above-mentioned actions by the French side in violation of the agreement.

    法兰西联邦部队在中越南部第五联区集结区
    连续逮捕和屠杀曾参加抗战的爱国人士
      法方并在老挝北部集结区空投伞兵阴谋制造紧张局势
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社中越二十四日讯：法兰西联邦部队在中越南部第五联区的集结区对曾经积极参加抗战的人们进行报复。逮捕和屠杀这些爱国人士的事件不断增加。
    根据不完全的统计，在富安省的三个县中，已有四百余人只是由于曾参加反对外国侵略的爱国战争而被捕。在春土村，法兰西联邦部队用放映电影的办法诱骗人民前往，从而逮捕了六十名青年和原抗战的干部。在罗海，法兰西联邦部队颁布了戒严令，接着在十月六日逮捕了一百三十五名青年。在九月下旬调查法方屠杀平民事件的视察小组到达以前，法兰西联邦部队把银山村的居民集中在一个地方，并带走了其中的三十五人。法兰西联邦部队逮捕了富安省的黎文清律师，并在九月二十一日晚把他带到据点，猛刺他的身子，并向他的背部开了好几枪。许多被拘留者都在受酷刑时死去。还有许多人在受刑后被带走，一直没有下落。
    尽管第五联区联合停战委员会中的越南人民军代表提出了强硬抗议，法兰西联邦部队在第五联区的集结区所干的这种恐怖事件最近还是不断发生。法兰西联邦部队总司令部必须立即终止一切暴行和违反停战协定的行为，法兰西联邦部队总司令部并应对这种卑鄙的报复行动负全部责任。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社河内二十三日讯：来自老挝的专电报道：在老挝的法兰西联邦部队在八月二十三日到三十日期间，在老挝北部丰沙里省的磅怒机场空投了七十八名官兵和六十四个降落伞的武器、粮食。这些伞兵着陆以后，便进而占领了距磅怒机场二百公尺的两座山头。此后，他们便对邻近的地区进行了袭击，并且强迫当地居民为他们在山上修筑防御工事。他们还强拉老挝的青年当兵，劫掠人民的财产，并禁止居民出来耕种。
    法方空降伞兵到寮国战斗部队的集结地区（按丰沙里省是寮国战斗部队的集结地区），是阴谋制造紧张局势，从而为今后解决老挝的政治问题造成困难。因此，法方所进行的这种敌对行动严重违反了日内瓦协定以及双方在康开所达成的条款。
    寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员代表团自上周以来就已请求国际监督和监察委员会派遣一个视察小组到磅怒去进行调查。同时，磅怒的人民已写信给老挝联合停战委员会，抗议上述法方违反协议的行动。
