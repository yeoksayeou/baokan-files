Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th. Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser and British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Harold Anthony Nutting formally signed the Anglo-Egyptian agreement on the Suez Canal Zone in Cairo on the 19th, which was provisionally concluded by the governments of the two countries on July 27th. Although this seven-year agreement stipulates that British troops will withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone within twenty months, seemingly ending the over seventy-year British occupation of this important strategic area of Egypt, the Suez Canal Zone military base will, in fact, remain under foreign control.

The agreement stipulates that after the withdrawal of British troops, the main equipment of the Suez Canal Zone military base will be handed over to British "civilian contracting companies" for maintenance and management. The British authorities have already announced that the representative of these "civilian contracting companies" is Mr. [Sir] Duncanson, Chairman of the British National Production Advisory Council on Industry.

According to the agreement, during its effective period, British Air Force planes may fly over Egypt and land in the Suez Canal Zone with prior notification, and use the airport facilities there. In addition, Britain may store a certain amount of military supplies at the Suez Canal Zone military base.

The agreement also stipulates that if Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Libya, and the other eight countries currently participating in the Arab League and Turkey are subjected to "armed attack," Egypt will provide Britain with "the necessary facilities to put this base on a war footing and to use it effectively," and these "facilities" also include the use of Egyptian ports. It is noted that Turkey is already a member of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc manipulated by the United States and a signatory to the Turkey-Pakistan military agreement. The entanglement of Egypt and Turkey is in line with the US conspiracy to make Egypt subordinate to US war policy.

It is also noted that the basis for Britain's original occupation of the Suez Canal Zone was the "Anglo-Egyptian Twenty-Year Treaty of Alliance" signed in 1936, which was due to expire in 1956, but the new agreement will not expire until 1961.

After this agreement was provisionally signed on July 27 this year, it aroused opposition from the Egyptian public. According to the Syrian "Al-Talia" newspaper, the Egyptian public has held several demonstrations against the agreement, with the masses chanting "Down with the imperialists and their allies!" in these demonstrations. According to Cairo police authorities, on the afternoon of October 19, just a few hours before the new agreement was formally signed, mass demonstrations were held in the suburbs of Cairo to oppose the agreement.

### 英埃签署苏彝士运河区协定

    英埃签署苏彝士运河区协定
   【新华社二十日讯】开罗消息：埃及总理纳赛尔和英国外交副大臣哈罗德·安东尼·纳丁十九日在开罗正式签署了英埃两国政府在七月二十七日临时签订的关于苏彝士运河区的英埃协定。这个为期七年的协定虽然规定英军在二十个月内撤出苏彝士运河区，表面上好像这将结束七十多年来英军占领埃及这个重要战略地区的状态，但是实际上，苏彝士运河区军事基地仍将继续处在外国控制之下。
    协定规定，在英军撤出后，苏彝士运河区军事基地的主要设备要交由英国的“民间承包公司”保养和管理。英国当局已经宣布，这些“民间承包公司”的代表是英国全国生产委员会主席邓肯逊。
    根据协定，在协定有效期间，英国空军飞机只要经过预先通知，就可以飞越埃及并在苏彝士运河区降落，使用那里的机场设备。另外，英国还可以在苏彝士运河区军事基地储藏一定数量的军事供应品。
    协定还规定，一旦埃及、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、外约旦、沙特阿拉伯、也门、利比亚等八个目前参加阿拉伯联盟的国家和土耳其受到“武装攻击”时，埃及就要提供给英国“必要的便利以便把这个基地置于战争基础之上并且有效地使用它”，这些“便利”还包括使用埃及的港口。人们注意到，土耳其已是美国操纵下的北大西洋侵略集团的成员国和土耳其—巴基斯坦军事协定的缔约一方。协定把埃及和土耳其牵连在一起，是符合美国力图促使埃及从属于美国战争政策的阴谋的。
    人们还注意到，英国原来据以占领苏彝士运河区的是一九三六年签订的“英埃二十年同盟条约”，这个条约到一九五六年就满期，但是新协定却要到一九六一年才满期。
    这个协定在今年七月二十七日临时签署后，就引起埃及公众的反对。据叙利亚“塔利亚报”报道，埃及公众曾举行过好几次示威反对这个协定，群众在这些示威中高呼“打倒帝国主义者和他们的同盟者！”据开罗警察当局说，就在十月十九日下午，新协定正式签字之前几小时，开罗市郊又举行了群众示威，反对这个协定。
