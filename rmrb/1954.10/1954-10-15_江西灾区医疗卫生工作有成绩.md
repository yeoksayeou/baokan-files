Jiangxi Province is vigorously carrying out medical and health work in water-damaged areas, and is promptly preventing the spread of diseases in disaster areas.

As the floodwaters recede in the disaster areas of Jiangxi Province, health organizations at all levels in Jiangxi Province have generally strengthened their health work force in the disaster areas. As of now, more than 1,300 health workers have been dispatched. They have formed mobile medical teams, temporary clinics, maternal and child health stations, and schistosomiasis prevention and control guidance groups to serve the vast number of disaster victims in depth. According to incomplete statistics, medical organizations in various places have completed more than 270,000 treatments, and 79% of the disaster victims in various parts of Jiangxi Province have enjoyed free diagnosis and treatment. Maternal and child health workers have also actively carried out work in the disaster areas. Temporary maternity stations in the disaster areas of Nanchang and Xinjian delivered more than 1,000 babies during the floods. Jiujiang City specially organized maternal and child health boats during the flooding, traveling back and forth in the water to serve the disaster victims, delivering a total of 294 babies, performing 472 prenatal checkups for pregnant women, and 1,355 postpartum visits.

A large number of health workers in the disaster areas also cooperated with local residents to carry out autumn cleaning campaigns. In general, three to five large-scale cleaning campaigns have been carried out in the disaster areas of Jiangxi Province. Jiujiang City alone mobilized the masses to remove more than 361,000 catties of garbage and sludge in one instance. At the same time, preventive vaccinations and drinking water disinfection were carried out. The Jiangxi Provincial Health Department distributed 60,000 kilograms of bleaching powder and 666 and other drugs throughout the province. Health workers in the Nanchang Special District vaccinated 300,000 people against cholera and typhoid fever. The Jiujiang Special District trained a large number of voluntary disinfection workers from the masses to disinfect drinking water for disaster victims.

The rapid development of health work in the disaster areas has further strengthened the confidence of the people in the disaster areas to fight against natural disasters. Recently, the disease situation in the disaster areas of Jiangxi Province has significantly declined. The Wuxi Medical Station originally had more than 100 outpatients every day, but now it has been reduced to only more than 20. In Yugan County, the number of outpatients decreased by 3,049 in one month. In Gaoqiao Township, Yongxiu County, there were more than 90 patients, and now more than 80 of them have fully recovered. The remaining dozen or so patients with more serious conditions are also gradually recovering. Farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of Jiangxi Province have said that they will respond to the government's concern with practical actions of hard work in production and overcoming disasters.

    江西灾区医疗卫生工作有成绩
    江西省大力开展水灾地区医疗卫生工作，及时预防灾区疾病流行。
    随着江西省受灾地区水情的退落，江西省各级卫生组织普遍增强了灾区卫生工作力量，截至目前止，派出的卫生工作人员共有一千三百多名，他们组成了巡回医疗队、临时门诊所、妇幼保健站、血吸虫病防治辅导组，深入灾区为广大灾民服务。据不完全统计，各地医疗组织已完成了二十七万余人次的治疗任务，江西省各地灾民中有百分之七十九的人享受了免费诊治。妇幼保健人员也在灾区积极开展了工作。南昌、新建的灾区临时接生站，在水灾期间接生达一千多人，九江市在水淹期间，专门组织了妇幼保健船，在水中来回为灾民服务，共接生二百九十四人，为产妇作了产前检查四百七十二次、产后访视一千三百五十五次。
    大批的卫生工作人员在灾区还配合当地居民开展了秋季清洁运动，江西省各灾区一般地都进行了三至五次清洁大扫除运动，九江市一次就动员群众清除垃圾污泥达三十六万一千多斤，同时还进行了预防注射、饮水消毒等工作，江西省卫生厅曾在全省范围内发放了六万公斤漂白粉和六六六等药品。南昌专区卫生工作人员替三十万人注射了霍乱伤寒预防针，九江专区训练了大批群众义务消毒员，为灾民进行饮水消毒工作。
    灾区卫生工作的迅速开展，更加强了灾区人民和自然灾害作斗争的信心。最近以来，江西省灾区的病情显著下降，武溪医疗站原来每日有一百多名门诊患者，现在减少到只有二十多名，余干县在一个月内，门诊人数减少三千零四十九人次。永修县高桥乡原有病人九十多人，现在已有八十余人完全恢复了健康，余下的十数个病情较重的患者也正逐步恢复健康。江西省受灾地区的农民纷纷表示：要以努力生产、战胜灾患的实际行动答谢政府的关怀。
