Dear Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Vice-Chairman Zhu De:
I am delighted to learn that you have been entrusted by the entire Chinese people to be elected as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the People's Republic of China. This is a concentrated expression of the trust and support of the 600 million Chinese people for their long-tested and great leaders. On behalf of the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to you, and take this opportunity to express my deep congratulations to the government and people of the People's Republic of China through you.
Your election is not only a new and great victory in the democratic life of the Chinese people, but the Vietnamese people are also proud that the people of their great neighbor have elected their wise helmsmen in the historically significant struggle to move towards socialist construction. I am deeply convinced that the People's Republic of China will become increasingly prosperous and happy as a result, the fraternal friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China will increasingly develop and consolidate, and the peoples of the two countries will unite more closely in the noble cause of safeguarding peace and security in Asia and the world, and achieve more brilliant victories.
