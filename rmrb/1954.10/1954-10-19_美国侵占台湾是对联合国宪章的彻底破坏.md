The US Occupation of Taiwan is a Thorough Violation of the UN Charter
Wang Tieyai

Taiwan is Chinese territory, both legally and factually, and this is beyond dispute. The Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender all stipulated the return of Taiwan to China, and Taiwan was in fact returned to China after the end of the war. Therefore, not only has the whole world always recognized Taiwan as an inseparable part of Chinese territory, but the US government has also had to acknowledge China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan. Any absurd claim that denies Taiwan is Chinese territory has no meaning or effect other than attempting to infringe upon China's territorial sovereignty.

Since Taiwan is Chinese territory, the various acts of aggression by the United States in Taiwan in recent years cannot but constitute a serious crime of undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

This act of aggression by the United States against the People's Republic of China completely violates the spirit of the UN Charter, completely violates the purposes and principles stipulated in the UN Charter, and completely violates the obligations that UN member states should bear under the UN Charter.

Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the UN Charter clearly stipulates that one of the obligations of UN member states is: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." This obligation of UN member states is one of the principles that the UN and its member states should abide by, and it is also one of the most important principles generally recognized since the establishment of the UN at the San Francisco Conference. Negating this principle would make it impossible to achieve the purposes that the UN wants to achieve, and would also cause the UN to lose the basis for its existence. The US occupation of Taiwan completely violates this provision. The United States openly and directly infringed upon China's territorial integrity, which is not only using methods "inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations," not only using "threats," but simply using force, implementing the occupation of Taiwan with fleets and aircraft. The United States brazenly disregards its obligations as a UN member state and its obligations to another member state, which shows the extent to which the United States despises the UN Charter.

Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the UN Charter not only stipulates that the territorial integrity of member states should be maintained, but also that the political independence of member states should be guaranteed. This excludes any attempt to infringe upon the political independence of countries, and also prohibits any member state from interfering in the internal affairs of other member states or countries. Therefore, Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN Charter also clearly stipulates that the UN itself shall not intervene in "matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The UN Charter thus affirms the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is entirely a matter for the Chinese people themselves, a Chinese domestic affair, and China's internal affairs. The United States supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan is not only interfering in China's internal affairs, but also directly interfering in China's internal affairs on Chinese territory; it is not only generally interfering in China's internal affairs, but also violently interfering in China's internal affairs with armed forces. This seriously infringes upon China's political independence and violates one of the important principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries stipulated in Article 2 of the UN Charter.

The United States undermines China's territorial sovereignty, interferes in our country's internal affairs, and violates the basic norms of international law. This is also completely inconsistent with the UN Charter's preamble's stipulation to "respect obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law."

The situation caused by the US occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world, violating the UN Charter's purpose of "maintaining international peace and security." Therefore, any member state—especially a country harmed by acts of aggression—has the right to lodge a complaint with the UN General Assembly or the Security Council in accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter. The UN General Assembly or the Security Council must accept such complaints and deal with them in accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter.

In August 1950, after the United States openly began to occupy Taiwan, the government of the People's Republic of China lodged a complaint with the UN Security Council against the US armed aggression against Taiwan. Due to US obstruction, the Security Council did not take action. Since then, the United States has continued to carry out obstruction activities in the United Nations and has obstructed the restoration of the legitimate status and rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. These are all in conflict with the wishes of all peace-loving countries and peoples.

Now, the US aggressors are stepping up preparations to expand their aggression against China and increase the threat of war in the Far East; and our government's "Complaint Against Armed Aggression Against Taiwan" to the UN Security Council is still on the agenda of the Security Council. If the United Nations does not want its prestige to suffer even more serious blows, it must not allow this situation to continue and develop.

In order to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, to defend international peace and security, and to uphold the dignity of the UN Charter, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has once again submitted a complaint to the Ninth Session of the UN General Assembly against the US armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan, and requested the General Assembly to urge the Security Council to stop US aggression. Soviet representative Vyshinsky submitted a formal proposal to the UN General Assembly on the 15th, condemning the US armed forces' acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China, which seriously threatens peace; and suggested that the UN General Assembly instruct the US government to take necessary steps to stop this aggression and include this proposal as a new item on the General Assembly's agenda. The just complaints and demands of our government and the Soviet government are unanimously supported by the Chinese people and will be sympathized with and supported by all progressive mankind.

World public opinion is closely watching what attitude the Ninth Session of the UN General Assembly will take towards this just complaint and proposal of the Chinese and Soviet peoples. It is not surprising that US officials are trying to take a dismissive attitude. The question is whether the majority of UN member states, especially those who claim to be willing to enhance diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, will continue to succumb to the US policy of aggression and war, or adopt an independent attitude that conforms to the UN Charter. This is another serious test for the United Nations, and also another test of the sincerity of many countries in promoting normal international relations.

Our country and the Soviet Union's re-submission of complaints and demands to the United Nations demonstrates the Chinese and Soviet peoples' respect for the UN Charter, and also demonstrates the Chinese people's firm will to liberate Taiwan and the Soviet Union's position of upholding justice. The United States' aggressive actions that undermine the UN Charter must be sanctioned.

    美国侵占台湾是对联合国宪章的彻底破坏
    王铁崖
    台湾是中国的领土，无论在法律上或在事实上都是无可争论的。开罗宣言和波茨坦公告以及日本投降书，都规定了台湾归还中国，而大战结束之后，台湾在实际上也已经归还了中国。因此，不仅全世界人民从来就承认台湾是中国领土的不可分割的部分，就是美国政府也曾经不得不承认中国对于台湾的领土主权。任何否定台湾为中国领土的荒谬主张，除了企图侵犯中国的领土主权以外，是没有任何意义和效果的。
    台湾既然是中国的领土，这几年来美国在台湾的种种侵略行为，就不能不构成了严重破坏中国主权和领土完整的罪行。
    美国对中华人民共和国的这种侵略行为，完全违反联合国宪章的精神，完全违反联合国宪章所规定的宗旨和原则，完全违反联合国宪章所规定联合国会员国所应负的义务。
    联合国宪章第二条第四项明文规定了联合国会员国的义务之一，是：“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”。联合国会员国的这一义务是联合国及其会员国所应遵行的原则之一，也是自从旧金山会议成立联合国以来大家所公认的一个最重要的原则。抹煞这一原则，就无从实现联合国所要实现的宗旨，也就将使联合国失去其存在的基础。美国侵占台湾的行为就彻底地破坏了这一规定。美国公开地直接地侵害了中国的领土完整，这不但是用了
  “与联合国宗旨不符”的方法，不但使用了“威胁”，而是干脆地使用了武力，以舰队和飞机实行对台湾的占领。美国悍然不顾其作为联合国会员国的义务，不顾其对另一会员国所应负的义务，说明了美国对联合国宪章的蔑视是到了何等地步。
    联合国宪章第二条第四项不仅规定应维护会员国的领土完整，而且要保证会员国的政治独立，这就是排斥了侵害国家的政治独立的任何企图，也就禁止了任何会员国对于其他会员国或国家内政的任何干涉行为。因此，联合国宪章第二条第七项还明文规定联合国本身也不得干涉“在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”，联合国宪章就这样地肯定了互不干涉内政的原则。台湾是中国的领土，中国人民解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，这完全是中国人民自己的事情，是中国的国内事务，是中国的内政。美国支持蒋介石卖国集团，阻挠中国人民解放台湾，不仅是干涉中国的内政，而且是在中国的领土上直接干涉中国的内政；不仅是一般地干涉中国的内政，而是以武装力量横暴地干涉中国的内政。这就极端严重地侵害了中国的政治独立，违反了联合国宪章第二条所规定的不得干涉别国内政的重要原则之一。
    美国破坏中国的领土主权，干涉我国的内政，破坏了美国自己所签订的国际协定，违反国际法的基本准则。这又是与联合国宪章的序文所规定的“尊重由条约与国际法及其他渊源而起之义务”完全不相符合的。
    美国侵占中国领土台湾的行为所引起的情势，严重地威胁着远东及世界和平，违反联合国宪章关于“维持国际和平及安全”的宗旨。因此，任何会员国—特别是受侵略行为的损害的国家，都有权利根据联合国宪章的规定向联合国大会或安全理事会提出控诉。联合国大会或安全理事会必须接受这样的控诉，并按照联合国宪章的规定予以处理。
    一九五零年八月，在美国公然开始侵占台湾之后，中华人民共和国政府就向联合国安全理事会提出美国武装侵略台湾的控诉。由于美国的阻挠，安全理事会没有采取措施。自是以后，美国继续在联合国中进行阻挠活动，并阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国内的合法地位和权利。这都是与一切爱好和平的国家和人民的愿望相冲突的。
    现在，美国侵略者正在加紧准备扩大对中国的侵略、增加远东的战争威胁；而我国政府向联合国安全理事会的“控诉武装侵略台湾案”到现在还留在安全理事会的议程上。如果联合国不愿使自己的威信遭受更加严重的打击，就决不能容许这种局势继续存在和发展下去。
    我国周恩来外长为了维护中国的主权和领土完整，为了保卫国际和平和安全，为了维护联合国宪章的尊严，再向联合国大会第九届会议重新提出了对美国武装侵略中国领土台湾的控诉，并要求大会促使安理会制止美国的侵略行为。苏联代表维辛斯基十五日向联合国大会提出正式提案，谴责美国武装部队对中华人民共和国进行侵略的行为，严重威胁着和平；建议联合国大会责成美国政府采取必要步骤，停止这种侵略行为，并把这个建议作为一个新的项目列入大会议程。我国政府和苏联政府的这种正义的控诉和要求，中国人民一致拥护，并将得到全体进步人类的同情和支持。
    世界公众舆论正在密切注视着联合国大会第九届会议将对中国人民和苏联人民的这个正义控诉和建议采取什么态度。美国官方企图采取漠视态度，这是不足为奇的。问题在于联合国的多数会员国，特别是声言愿与中华人民共和国增进外交关系的会员国，是将继续屈从于美国的侵略政策和战争政策，还是采取符合联合国宪章的独立态度。这是对联合国的又一次严重的考验，也是对许多国家说要促进国际正常关系的诚意的又一次考验。
    我国和苏联重新向联合国提出的控诉和要求，表明中国人民和苏联人民对联合国宪章的尊重，同时也表明中国人民解放台湾的坚强意志和苏联主持正义的立场。美国破坏联合国宪章的侵略行为，必须受到制裁。
