    A Review of Overseas Chinese Affairs Work
    Propaganda Group of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission

    Our overseas Chinese compatriots are an integral part of our motherland's big family. Our country has boundless concern and care for overseas Chinese abroad, returned overseas Chinese, and the families of overseas Chinese. In the past, due to the reactionary ruling class in power in our country, the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese were not guaranteed at all, and the families of overseas Chinese residing in China also suffered cruel oppression. Some overseas Chinese who returned to the motherland also suffered the pain of unemployment and lack of education without anyone caring. They eagerly hoped for the victory of the people's revolution in the motherland and had contributed a lot of strength in the past revolutionary struggles. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, overseas Chinese, like the people of the whole country, became the masters of our country and participated in the management of state affairs. The Central People's Government and local people's governments at all levels have also taken many measures to protect and take care of the interests of overseas Chinese in areas such as facilitating overseas remittances, resettling returned overseas Chinese, and organizing returned overseas Chinese youth to enroll in schools. The patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese abroad has also increased as a result.
      One
    There are approximately 12 million overseas Chinese residing abroad, with more than 10 million distributed in Southeast Asia, including Malaya, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, the Philippines, and India. About 200,000 live in the Americas, and the rest are scattered around the world.
    Overseas Chinese work together with the local people in Southeast Asian countries and other places, live in friendship, and have made certain contributions to the development and prosperity of the local economy. Overseas Chinese love the motherland and look forward to an independent and prosperous New China. They have actively supported the revolutionary struggles of the people of the motherland for more than a hundred years and the national construction after the victory of the revolution. The great achievements of the People's Republic of China since its founding and the unprecedented improvement of its international status have greatly encouraged the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese abroad.
    At present, the situation of overseas Chinese has improved somewhat in countries that have established friendly relations with our country. However, in countries that are unfriendly to our country, the situation of overseas Chinese is difficult. The American aggressor group fears and hates the great New China, and therefore also fears and hates overseas Chinese, so it has stepped up its persecution of overseas Chinese. Some countries, either blindly following American policy or being coerced by the United States, have also adopted unfriendly attitudes towards overseas Chinese, and even intensified their persecution. For example, the 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Thailand have been subjected to large-scale persecution by the Thai government several times in recent years. Many overseas Chinese have been deported or arrested. The Philippine government also continues to implement anti-Chinese bills, persecuting the 180,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines. The activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in the Philippines are also rampant under the connivance and protection of the Philippine government. The situation of overseas Chinese in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam is also very difficult. Their painful lives stand in stark contrast to the free and happy lives of overseas Chinese residing in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The situation of the three million overseas Chinese in Malaya is not good. In the past five years, more than 400,000 to 500,000 overseas Chinese compatriots have been imprisoned in concentration camps set up by the Malayan government; according to official Malayan figures, more than 24,000 overseas Chinese compatriots have been unreasonably deported from 1948 to April 1953.
    For the past five years, our government has been closely monitoring the difficult situation of overseas Chinese compatriots. In order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese compatriots, our government and the people of the whole country have successively issued solemn protests and statements against the persecution of overseas Chinese by certain countries' authorities; expressed ardent concern for the persecuted overseas Chinese compatriots; and provided care and resettlement for the distressed overseas Chinese who were forced to return to the country.
      Two
    In 1951, the Enlarged Conference on Overseas Chinese Affairs of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, according to the instructions of the Government Administration Council, clearly pointed out that overseas Chinese compatriots should devote themselves to unity and mutual assistance, love the motherland; do a good job in mutual assistance and mutual relief welfare undertakings; protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese themselves; carry forward the fine tradition of overseas Chinese in running cultural education; promote friendly relations between overseas Chinese and the local people; and expose the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in harming overseas Chinese. With the increasing strength and progress of the motherland, the unity of overseas Chinese has become more consolidated, and their patriotic enthusiasm has been further enhanced. Some overseas Chinese compatriots who had previously misunderstood and doubted the motherland due to listening to the deceptive propaganda of the Chiang bandit gang have gradually changed their attitudes and united with the majority of overseas Chinese compatriots after learning about the true situation and policies of the motherland. The Chiang bandit gang has become increasingly isolated among overseas Chinese. In recent years, various overseas Chinese communities have made considerable progress in uniting for self-rescue, mutual assistance and mutual relief, disaster relief, running education, and holding various welfare undertakings. For example, in Indonesia, Burma, and other regions, in addition to establishing permanent relief organizations, overseas Chinese have also established some welfare institutions such as clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes. In some areas, overseas Chinese have set up scholarships for poor students. Burmese overseas Chinese also raise winter clothing for poor overseas Chinese compatriots every year.
    In order to understand the situation of the motherland's construction, overseas Chinese have organized sightseeing groups to return to the country for sightseeing. From 1951 to the end of 1953, 24 sightseeing groups had returned to the country for sightseeing. The feelings expressed by the overseas Chinese sightseeing groups from various regions after returning to their original places of residence expressed the true situation of the motherland's construction and the lives of the people of the motherland, helping the vast number of overseas Chinese to further understand the motherland and enhance their patriotic enthusiasm. The sightseeing groups also told overseas Chinese compatriots about the living conditions of their families in China and the new atmosphere of their hometowns. Overseas Chinese compatriots compared their past lives in China and expressed great joy at the good public security, good hygiene, good education, good transportation, and year-by-year development of production in their hometowns after liberation. Many people said: "Overseas Chinese families can now live well because of Chairman Mao's good leadership." This shattered the rumors and slanders of the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique against our motherland; at the same time, it also helped the local people to understand New China. Overseas Chinese public opinion circles also continuously publicize the achievements of the motherland's construction in various aspects and the new atmosphere of society, and publicize the motherland's peace policy and the friendly relations between the people of the motherland and the local people. In particular, the overseas Chinese newspapers and periodicals in countries that have established diplomatic relations with our country actively introduce the vigorous and upward new atmosphere of the motherland in the spirit of loving the motherland and serving overseas Chinese compatriots, introduce the great achievements of the people of the motherland in engaging in peaceful construction under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, especially the achievements of economic construction; at the same time, they also reflect the joy and enthusiasm shown by overseas Chinese compatriots for the brilliant achievements of the motherland's construction and the increasing improvement of its international status; they also severely denounced the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in harming overseas Chinese.
    The Central People's Broadcasting Station has added programs broadcast to overseas Chinese in local dialects such as Cantonese, Chaozhou, Hakka, and Xiamen since 1950. In 1952, Jin Zhonghua and others in the domestic news media founded the China News Agency to provide news about New China to foreign countries, broadcasting recorded news every day, and issuing newsletters, "selected manuscripts" and various special manuscripts and picture manuscripts, giving certain assistance to overseas Chinese public opinion circles.
    Three
    The majority of overseas Chinese have families in China, and the lives of overseas Chinese families mostly depend on the labor income of relatives abroad; at the same time, the motherland is gradually transitioning to socialism, while the situation in the countries where the vast majority of overseas Chinese are located is fundamentally different. In the past five years, the People's Government, based on this special situation, has formulated a policy to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese abroad, and established the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission under the Central People's Government to specifically manage overseas Chinese affairs. Provincial and municipal people's governments in Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities have also established overseas Chinese affairs agencies dedicated to serving overseas Chinese. At the same time, appropriate resettlement is given to returned overseas Chinese, and appropriate and necessary care is given to the families of overseas Chinese remaining in China during some important social reform movements. The first is to formulate and implement the national policy of "facilitating overseas remittances and serving overseas Chinese compatriots." Entrusted by the state, the Bank of China has successively launched "remittances in original currency," "deposits in original currency," "remittances in RMB," and "small low-interest loans for overseas Chinese families," reducing remittance procedures, effectively guaranteeing the interests of overseas Chinese compatriots and their families, and promptly resolving the difficulties of many overseas Chinese families. From 1950 to the present, the People's Bank of China and the Bank of China have established 35 service departments in the areas where overseas Chinese families reside. In order to continue to implement the policy of "facilitating overseas remittances," the People's Government has adopted various measures to protect overseas remittances in order to correct various behaviors that violate overseas remittance policies.
    After liberation, when carrying out land system reform in areas where overseas Chinese families resided, local people's governments at all levels mobilized and organized overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese to participate in the land reform movement. After the completion of land reform, overseas Chinese families and returned overseas Chinese were mobilized and organized to participate in agricultural and handicraft production and mutual assistance and cooperation movements.
    In the past five years, the various overseas Chinese affairs agencies have received nearly 80,000 overseas Chinese compatriots returning from Malaya, Thailand, French-occupied Vietnam, Japan, and other places, and have done their best to provide appropriate resettlement. Returned overseas Chinese students have been sent to schools at all levels in the country and to the secondary remedial schools for returned overseas Chinese students in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Xiamen for study. Active guidance is also given to overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen who are unable to maintain themselves abroad and are willing to return to the country to invest and participate in construction. Some overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen have now returned to the country to invest in domestic industry and commerce. The People's Government is also preparing to implement measures to allow overseas Chinese capital to invest in the development of mountain forests and wasteland, plant plantations, open ranches, build houses, and run cultural and educational undertakings, so as to facilitate overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen to return to the country to participate in construction.
    In the past five years, the overseas Chinese affairs work of the Central People's Government has achieved many successes. In the future, with the victory of national construction and the increasing strength of the motherland, with the continued development and consolidation of the friendship between our people and the peace-loving people of the world, and with the continued development of friendly relations between our country and many countries in Asia and the world, the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese will be further expanded and consolidated. The friendly and harmonious relations between overseas Chinese and the people of various countries of residence will also have good development.

    侨务工作的回顾
    华侨事务委员会宣传组
    我国在外华侨是我们祖国大家庭的组成部分。我们国家对于国外华侨、归国华侨以及华侨眷属有着无限的关怀和爱护。过去由于我国反动统治阶级当权，华侨的正当权利和利益毫无保障，留居国内的华侨眷属也遭受着残酷的压榨。有些华侨回到祖国，也遭受着失业失学的痛苦而无人过问。他们热望祖国人民革命胜利，曾经在历次革命斗争中出过不少力量。中华人民共和国成立以后，华侨和全国人民一样，成了我们国家的主人，参加了国家事务的管理。中央人民政府及地方各级人民政府并在便利侨汇、安置归国侨胞、组织归国华侨青年入学等等方面，采取了许多措施，保护和照顾了华侨的利益。国外华侨的爱国热情，也因此日益高涨。
      一
    我国旅居国外的侨民约一千二百万人，分布在马来亚、泰国、印度尼西亚、越南、缅甸、菲律宾、印度等东南亚各地的达一千万人以上，旅居美洲的约二十多万人，其他则零星分布在世界各地。
    华侨在东南亚各国以及其他一些地方，与当地人民共同劳动，友好相处，对当地经济的开发和繁荣作了一定的贡献。华侨热爱祖国，盼望着有一个独立富强的新中国，对祖国人民百余年来的革命斗争和革命胜利以后的国家建设，都是积极支持的。中华人民共和国成立以来的伟大成就，和国际地位的空前提高，更使国外华侨的爱国热情受到极大的鼓舞。
    目前，在与我国建立了友好关系的国家，华侨的处境有了若干的改善。但在对我国不友好的国家，华侨的处境是困难的。美国侵略集团因为畏惧和仇恨伟大的新中国，因而也畏惧和仇视华侨，所以就加紧迫害华侨。有些国家，或则盲目追随美国政策，或则被美国强制，对华侨亦采取不友善态度，甚至有加紧迫害的行为。比如在泰国的三百五十万华侨，几年来，就曾数次遭受泰国政府大规模的迫害。许多华侨被驱逐出境或被逮捕。菲律宾政府也不断实施排华的法案，迫害在菲律宾的十八万华侨。蒋介石卖国集团在菲律宾的活动，也在菲律宾政府的纵容包庇下日益猖獗。越南法国占领区的华侨，处境也很困难。他们的痛苦生活，和旅居越南民主共和国华侨的自由幸福的生活形成了鲜明的对照。马来亚三百万华侨的处境并不好。五年来，被关闭在马来亚政府所设的集中营里的侨胞达四、五十万人以上；被无理驱逐出境的侨胞，仅据马来亚官方发表的数字：从一九四八年到一九五三年四月，即达二万四千人以上。
    我国政府五年来密切注视侨胞的这种困难处境，我国政府和全国人民为着保护侨胞的正当权利和利益，对于某些国家当局迫害华侨的行为，曾先后发表了严正的抗议和声明；对于被迫害的侨胞，表示了热切的关怀；对于被迫害回国的难侨，则予以照顾和安置。
      二
    一九五一年，中央人民政府华侨事务委员会侨务扩大会议，根据政务院的指示，明确地指出国外侨胞应致力于团结互助、爱护祖国；做好互助互济的福利事业；保护华侨自己的正当权利和利益；发扬华侨兴办文化教育的优良传统；促进华侨与当地人民的友好关系；揭露蒋介石卖国集团的祸侨害侨罪行。随着祖国的日益强大和进步，国外华侨的团结更加巩固了，爱国热情更加提高了。过去误听蒋匪帮欺骗宣传而对祖国有所怀疑的一些侨胞，由于了解到祖国的真实情况和政策，也逐渐改变了态度，和大多数侨胞团结在一起。蒋匪帮在华侨中已日趋孤立。几年来，各地华侨在团结自救、互助互济、救灾、办教育和举办各种福利事业等方面的工作都有了相当的开展。如在印度尼西亚、缅甸和其他地区，华侨除了成立有常设的救济机构外，并成立了诊疗所、医院、养老院等一些福利机构。有一些地区华侨已为贫苦学生设有助学金。缅甸华侨每年并为贫苦侨胞募集寒衣。
    国外华侨为了了解祖国建设的情况，曾经组织了回国观光团回国观光。从一九五一年到一九五三年底止，已有二十四个观光团回国观光。各地区的华侨回国观光团，回到原侨居地以后所发表的观感，表达了祖国建设、祖国人民生活的真情实况，帮助广大侨胞进一步认识了祖国，提高了爱国的热情，观光团也把国外侨胞在国内的眷属生活情况和侨乡的新气象告诉了侨胞。侨胞对比了过去自己在国内的生活，对家乡解放后治安好、卫生好、教育好、交通好、生产一年比一年发展，表示非常欢欣，许多人说：“侨眷现在生活能过得好，都是毛主席领导得好。”粉碎了美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团对我们祖国的造谣诬蔑；同时也有助于当地人民对新中国的了解。国外华侨舆论界也不断宣扬祖国各方面建设的成就和社会的新气象，宣扬祖国的和平政策和祖国人民与当地人民的友好关系。特别是和我国建立了外交关系的国家里的华侨报刊，都一本热爱祖国、服务侨胞的精神，积极介绍祖国的蓬勃向上的新气象，介绍祖国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下从事和平建设的伟大成就，特别是经济建设的成就；同时还反映了侨胞对祖国建设的辉煌成就和国际地位日益提高所表现的欢欣和热情；对蒋介石卖国集团祸侨、害侨的罪行，也作了严正的指斥。
    中央人民广播电台从一九五○年起增设用广东、潮州、客家、厦门等地方言对国外华侨广播的节目。一九五二年国内新闻界金仲华等为向国外供应新中国消息，创办了中国新闻社，每日广播记录新闻，并发通讯、“选稿”及各种专稿与图片稿等，给予了国外华侨舆论界一定的帮助。
    三
    国外华侨大多数都有眷属在国内，华侨眷属的生活大多依靠国外亲属的劳动所得维持；同时祖国正在逐步向社会主义过渡，而绝大多数华侨所在国的情况则根本不同。五年来，人民政府根据这一特殊情形，制定了保护国外华侨的正当权利和利益的政策，在中央人民政府下设立了华侨事务委员会，专门管理华侨事务。在广东、福建、云南、上海等省市人民政府内，也都设有专为华侨服务的侨务机构。同时，对归国华侨也给以适当的安置，并在一些重要的社会改革运动中对华侨留在国内的眷属予以适当的和必要的照顾。首先是制订和贯彻了国家关于“便利侨汇、服务侨胞”的政策。中国银行受国家的委托，先后举办了“原币汇款”、“原币存款”及“人民币汇款”、“侨眷低利小额贷款”，减少了转汇手续，切实保障了侨胞、侨眷的利益，及时解决了许多侨眷的困难。中国人民银行、中国银行从一九五○年到现在，已经在国内侨眷居住地区建立了三十五个服务部。为继续贯彻“便利侨汇”的方针，人民政府又采取了各种保护侨汇的措施，以纠正各种违犯侨汇政策的行为。
    解放以后，在侨眷居住地区进行土地制度改革时，地方各级人民政府都发动、组织了侨眷、归侨参加了土地改革运动。土地改革完成以后，又动员、组织侨眷、归侨参加农业、手工业生产和互助合作运动。
    各侨务机构在这五年中，共接待了从马来亚、泰国、越南法占区、日本等各地回国的侨胞将近八万人，并已尽可能地做到了适当的安置。回国的华侨学生，已经分别送进国内各级学校及北京、广州、厦门三地的归国华侨学生中等补习学校学习。对于在国外无法维持而愿意回国投资参加建设的华侨工商业者，也积极的予以辅导。现在已有一些华侨工商业者回国投资于国内工商业。人民政府还正在准备施行允许华侨资本投资开发山林、荒地、种植农园，开办牧场，兴造房屋，以及兴办文教事业等办法，以便利华侨工商业界回国参加建设。
    五年来，中央人民政府的侨务工作取得许多成就。今后，随着国家建设的胜利和祖国的日益强大，随着我国人民同全世界爱好和平人民友谊的继续发展和巩固，随着我国和亚洲以及世界许多国家友好关系的继续发展，国外华侨的爱国团结必将进
  一步的扩大和巩固。华侨和各侨居国人民友好和睦的关系，也将有良好的发展。
