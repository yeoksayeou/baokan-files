    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant's ingot casting workshop successfully trialed ingot casting on ingot mold transporting vehicles (referred to as "vehicle casting") on October 7th.
    The ingot casting workshop originally used "pit casting," which involved placing the ingot molds in fixed concrete pits below the steelmaking furnace to pour the molten steel. "Pit casting" required waiting for the steel ingots to cool before performing a dozen processes such as demolding, mold rectification, and oiling in the same location. As a result, it took seven or eight hours, or even more than ten hours, for the ingot molds to complete one cycle. In addition, about 15% of the steel ingots often could not be demolded. This not only affected the steelmaking furnace's tapping time due to the pit's slow turnaround, but also prevented the steelmaking plant from completing its product variety plan (because ingots that could not be demolded could only be repurposed for other varieties). To change this situation, they learned from advanced Soviet experience and trialed "vehicle casting," which involves pouring the molten steel on 120-ton ingot mold transporting vehicles, and then using locomotives to pull the ingot mold transporting vehicles to the demolding plant and mold rectification plant for demolding, mold rectification, cooling, oiling, and other work.
    On October 7th, the ingot casting workshop tested this new ingot casting method. At 4:00 PM, a hundred-ton crane hoisted the first ladle of molten steel from a certain open-hearth furnace to mid-air above the ingot mold transporting vehicle. After a quick adjustment, the steel tap of the ladle was opened, and the fiery molten steel poured into the ingot molds on the vehicle. At 4:50 PM, all the molten steel had been cast, and then it was sent to the demolding plant for demolding. All products were inspected by the inspection station, proving that the quality met national standards. After the successful trial of this advanced ingot casting method, it will no longer affect the steelmaking furnace's tapping time, and it will also solve the problem of 15% of the steel ingots not being able to be demolded.

    鞍钢炼钢厂试用苏联先进铸锭法成功
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂铸锭车间，十月七日试验在钢锭模搬运车上铸锭（简称“车铸”）成功。
    铸锭车间原来用的是“坑铸”，这就是将钢锭模放在炼钢炉下面的固定混凝土坑内，浇铸钢水。“坑铸”必须等钢锭冷却后，才能在同一地方进行脱模、整模、涂油等十几道工序的工作。这样，钢锭模周转一次需要七、八小时，甚至超过十小时；还经常有百分之十五左右的钢锭不能脱模。这不但使炼钢炉常因地坑周转不开而影响出钢，并且使炼钢厂不能完成品种计划（因不能脱模的钢锭只能改做其他品种）。为改变这种情况，他们学习苏联先进经验，试用“车铸”，就是在一百二十吨钢锭模搬运车上进行浇铸，再用机车把钢锭模搬运车牵引到脱模厂、整模厂进行脱模、整模、冷却、涂油等工作。
    十月七日铸锭车间试验这一新铸锭法。下午四时，百吨吊车把某号平炉炼出来的第一罐钢水吊到钢锭模搬运车上边的半空，经过迅速的调整，放开了钢罐的出钢口，火红的钢水下注到车上的钢锭模内。四点五十分钟，钢水全部铸完，接着就送到脱模厂脱模。全部产品经过检查站检查，证明质量合乎国家指标。这一先进铸锭法试验成功后，再不会影响炼钢炉的出钢时间，也解决了百分之十五的钢锭不能脱模的问题。
