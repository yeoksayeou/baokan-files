    Liaoning Province Holds First Conference on Amateur Cultural Education for Farmers

    The first Liaoning Provincial Conference on Amateur Cultural Education for Farmers was held in Shenyang from the 12th to the 18th. The conference arranged the tasks for this year's winter school program and discussed the implementation of the national guidelines and tasks for amateur cultural education for farmers.

    This year, Liaoning Province will organize 600,000 farmers to participate in winter school, with the goal of eliminating illiteracy for 120,000 of them. Cities and counties will also focus on piloting spare-time higher elementary school classes and extensively organizing self-study groups, absorbing a large number of farmers with limited literacy and higher elementary school graduates engaged in agricultural production to continue their studies.

    Last year, 510,000 farmers in Liaoning Province participated in winter school, of which 100,000 had already shed their illiteracy in winter school, and 200,000 had joined regular learning after winter school. This year, Liaoning Province's winter school will focus on schools run by agricultural producers' cooperatives to organize farmers for amateur cultural learning, but it is still necessary to strengthen leadership over the civil schools or literacy classes organized by village in the past, and continue to run them well. To ensure the smooth progress of winter school, Liaoning Province will train more than 17,000 mass teachers. Cities and counties will pilot off-production and off-duty literacy classes, and transfer some of the key village cadres who have the conditions to leave their posts to study in a concentrated manner.

    辽宁省举行第一次农民业余文化教育会议
    辽宁省第一次农民业余文化教育会议十二日到十八日在沈阳举行。会议布置了今年冬学的任务，并讨论了贯彻全国农民业余文化教育的方针、任务。
    今年辽宁省将组织六十万农民参加冬学，其中要求扫除十二万文盲。各市、县还将重点试办业余学习高小班和广泛组织自学小组，大量吸收识字不多的农民和参加农业生产的高小毕业生，继续进行学习。
    去年辽宁省参加冬学的农民有五十一万人，其中十万人已经在冬学中摆脱了文盲状态，二十万人在冬学后又参加了常年学习。今年辽宁省冬学将以农业生产合作社办学为重点，组织农民进行业余文化学习，但对过去以村为单位办的民校或识字班仍须加强领导，继续把它办好。为了使冬学顺利进行，辽宁省即将训练群众教师一万七千多名。各市、县将试办脱离生产和离职扫盲班，抽调一部分有条件离职学习的主要村干部集中学习。
