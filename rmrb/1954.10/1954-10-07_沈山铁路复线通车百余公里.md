The Shenyang-Shanhaiguan Railway double-track project, which began construction on January 3 this year, had completed the laying of tracks for a hundred-kilometer-long section from Shuangyangdian Station to Xiliu Station by the end of September. This section of the line has now been opened to traffic. The remaining roadbed and bridge construction work from Xiliu Station to Xinmin Station, a length of sixty kilometers, has also been completed, and all preparations for track laying have been made. As soon as the steel rails arrive, the entire project can be completed quickly. The quality of the completed project fully meets the design requirements. The roadbed has not subsided during this year's rainy season and can fully withstand a driving speed of fifty kilometers per hour. The bearing capacity of the bridge piers has also reached the design standards.

After the entire Shenyang-Shanhaiguan double-track line is open to traffic, the transport capacity will be more than doubled compared to the past. Construction sites and factories and mines relying on the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line to transport materials and raw materials will be able to obtain the raw materials they need more quickly, and farmers will also be able to obtain the large quantities of industrial products transported from various places more conveniently.

    沈山铁路复线通车百余公里
    今年一月三日开始施工的沈（阳）山（海关）铁路复线工程，到九月末已完成由双羊店车站到西刘车站一百公里长的铺轨工程，这段线路现在已经开始通车；其余由西刘车站到新民车站六十公里长的路基工程和架桥工程亦已完成，并作好了一切铺轨的准备工作，只要钢轨一到，全部工程很快就可竣工。已经竣工的工程质量，完全合乎设计要求，路基在今年多雨的季节里也没有下沉，完全可以承担一小时五十公里的行车速度，桥墩承载力也达到设计标准。
    沈山复线全部通车以后，运输能力要比过去提高一倍以上，依靠沈山线运输材料和原料的工地和厂矿，就会更快地得到自己所需要的原材料，农民也将更方便地取得各地运来的大量工业品。
