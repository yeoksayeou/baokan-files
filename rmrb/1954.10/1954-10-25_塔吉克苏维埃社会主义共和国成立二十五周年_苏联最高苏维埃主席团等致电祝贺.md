    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 23rd: TASS, Moscow, October 23rd:  The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sent a telegram to the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik Republic, the Council of Ministers of the Tajik Republic, and the Central Committee of the Tajik Communist Party, congratulating them on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic.
    The telegram stated: The great October Socialist Revolution liberated the Tajik people forever from feudalism and capitalist exploitation, from the national colonial oppression of the Tsarist autocracy, and opened up broad prospects for the Tajik working people to build a free and happy life.
    Because the Communist Party is implementing the wise Leninist-Stalinist national policy, the Tajik working people, with the help of all fraternal nationalities of the Soviet Union, have established their own country and transformed a backward economic and cultural border region of the Tsarist era into a free, prosperous, industrialized, and agriculturally collectivized socialist republic.
    During the years of Soviet power, the working class of the Tajik Republic has grown, and their alliance with the laboring peasants has achieved great success in socialist construction.
    The working people of Soviet Tajikistan have established a multi-sectoral industry. The Republic has established large enterprises in mining, coal mining, metal processing, cotton ginning, textiles, food and other industries, and has established a power base, replacing the former small handicraft factories.
    The victory of the collective farm system has ensured the leap forward development of agriculture in the Republic. The Republic's agriculture is equipped with the latest agricultural machinery and has a vast network of modern irrigation projects. Agricultural workers are actively striving for a new, rapid upsurge in all sectors of collective farms and state farms, especially in cotton planting, the leading sector of the Tajik economy. In the past five years, the area of cotton planting in the Republic has been greatly expanded, and the total harvest of raw cotton has almost doubled. Tajik cotton growers are known throughout the country for their outstanding skills.
    The national form and socialist content of Tajik people's culture continues to grow and flourish. Tajikistan, once a dark and backward border region, is now a republic of advanced Soviet culture. The Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic has established many middle schools, secondary specialized schools and institutions of higher learning; as well as a national university, an academy of sciences, many theaters, many clubs, libraries, reading rooms and cultural palaces. The army of intellectuals in Soviet Tajikistan – engineers, technicians, agronomists, teachers, doctors, scientific and cultural workers – has increased.
    The Soviet regime has completely liberated Tajik women, who were oppressed and without rights in the past, and now they participate as actively as men in all sectors of communist development. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Council of Ministers of the USSR, The Central Committee of the Soviet Union wished the working people of Soviet Tajikistan new achievements in their efforts to further prosper the Republic’s economy and culture, and are confident that, in the friendly family of all the nations of the Soviet Union, they will make new contributions to the great cause of winning communism in our country.

    塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国成立二十五周年
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团等致电祝贺
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会致电塔吉克共和国最高苏维埃、塔吉克共和国部长会议和塔吉克共产党中央委员会，祝贺塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国成立二十五周年。
    贺电说：伟大的十月社会主义革命使塔吉克人民永远摆脱了封建主义和资本主义的剥削，摆脱了沙皇专制政体的民族殖民压迫，并为塔吉克劳动人民开辟了建设自由幸福生活的广阔前途。
    由于共产党执行着英明的列宁—斯大林的民族政策，塔吉克劳动人民在苏联所有兄弟民族的帮助下建立了自己的国家，把过去沙皇时代一个经济、文化落后的边区变成了自由的、繁荣的、工业化和农业集体化的社会主义共和国。
    在苏维埃政权的年代中，塔吉克共和国的工人阶级成长了，他们同劳动农民结成联盟取得了社会主义建设的巨大成就。
    苏维埃塔吉克的劳动人民建立了多部门的工业。共和国建立了采矿、采煤、金属加工、净棉、纺织、食品等工业的巨大企业，建立了动力基地，而代替了过去的小手工业工厂。
    集体农庄制度的胜利保证了共和国农业的发展得以飞跃前进。共和国农业装备有最新的农业机器，并拥有广大的近代化的灌溉工程网。农业劳动者们正在积极地努力争取集体农庄和国营农场生产各部门，首先是塔吉克经济主导部门——植棉业的新的急剧的高涨。在最近五年内，共和国植棉面积已大大扩大，原棉的总收获量已几乎增加为二倍。塔吉克植棉者以自己的卓越技艺而闻名全国。
    塔吉克人民的民族形式的、社会主义内容的文化不断成长和繁荣。过去是黑暗和落后的边区的塔吉克现在是先进的苏维埃文化的共和国。塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国建立了许多中学、中等专科学校和高等学校；还有一所国立大学、一所科学院、许多戏院、许多俱乐部、图书馆、阅览室和文化宫。苏维埃塔吉克的知识大军——工程师、技术员、农学家、教师、医生、科学和文化工作者增加了。
    苏维埃政权完全解放了过去被压迫和无权的塔吉克妇女，现在她们和男子一样积极参加共产主义建设中各部门的工作。苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会祝苏维埃塔吉克劳动人民在争取共和国经济和文化进一步繁荣的努力中获得新的成就，并确信，他们在苏联各民族的友好大家庭中将会对争取共产主义在我国获得胜利的伟大事业做出新的贡献。
