(Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th) According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee continued its discussion of Burma's accusation of aggression by the Kuomintang clique on the 12th, 13th, and 14th, and concluded the discussion on the 15th. The committee unanimously passed a resolution based on a joint proposal by Britain and other countries. Kuomintang elements did not participate in the vote. The resolution declared that the Kuomintang troops in Burma must be disarmed and detained. The resolution assured the Burmese government of sympathy and support for its efforts to finally resolve the issue, and requested all countries to take all necessary steps to prevent providing any assistance to the Kuomintang troops in Burma.

The Soviet representative, Mr. Zarubin, spoke at the meeting on the 12th. He urged the committee to note that despite the passage of resolutions by the General Assembly, the so-called "withdrawal" did not involve regular troops, and the Kuomintang troops remained in Burma. These bandit troops have been reorganized and continue to take active military action against the Burmese government, plunder the local people, and conduct recruitment campaigns. Zarubin pointed out that the actions of the Kuomintang bandits in Burma constituted a violation of Burmese sovereignty, endangered peace and security in the region, and could lead to serious international disputes. Therefore, all Kuomintang bandits must be disarmed and withdrawn from Burma.

The American representative, Mr. Mahoney, also spoke at the meeting on the 12th. Mahoney stubbornly insisted that the dispersed and scattered Kuomintang bandits were not enough to threaten Burma. At the same time, he assured the committee that the US government was prepared to exchange views on this issue with relevant parties in the future.

Representatives from Indonesia, Poland, Britain, France, Turkey, Canada, and other countries spoke at the meeting on the 13th. The Indonesian representative said that the presence of Kuomintang troops in Burma was a serious threat to peace in Southeast Asia. He called the committee's attention to the fact that Chiang Kai-shek's various organizations continued to support these bandit troops, and he requested the United Nations to support the Burmese government in eliminating the existing threat. The Polish representative pointed out that the Kuomintang clique, utilizing aid received from the United States, continued to support its bandit troops in Burma. He requested the committee to consider the fact that the Kuomintang bandit troops' robbery in Burma, as well as their piracy in the China Sea, constituted a serious threat to peace in that part of the world.

Representatives from Britain, France, Turkey, Canada, and other countries, in their speeches, attempted to downplay the threat posed by the Kuomintang bandit troops remaining in Burma.

Representatives from Uruguay, Pakistan, Abyssinia, and India spoke at the meeting on the 14th. They all supported the Burmese government's accusation.

    联大特别政委会讨论缅甸控诉蒋匪侵略案
    苏、波、印等国代表支持缅甸政府的控诉
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会于十二日、十三日、十四日继续讨论缅甸控诉国民党集团侵略案，并于十五日结束了这一讨论。委员会根据英国等国家提出的联合提案，一致通过了一项决议。国民党分子没有参加表决。这项决议宣布在缅甸的国民党军队必须解除武装并予以拘禁。决议向缅甸政府保证同情和支持它为最后解决这个问题所作的努力，并要求各国采取一切必要步骤防止给予在缅甸的国民党军队以任何援助。
    苏联代表查鲁宾在十二日会议上发了言。他促请委员会注意，尽管大会通过了决议，所谓“撤退”并没有涉及到正规军队，国民党军队仍旧留在缅甸。这些匪军已经进行了改编，继续对缅甸政府采取积极的军事行动、掠夺当地人民并进行召募新兵的运动。查鲁宾指出，国民党匪徒在缅甸的行动，构成了对缅甸主权的侵犯，危及这个地区的和平与安全，并可能导致严重的国际纠纷。因此，必须把所有国民党匪徒解除武装和撤出缅甸。
    美国代表马洪尼也在十二日会议上发了言。马洪尼硬说，分散的、零星的国民党匪徒不足以威胁缅甸。同时，他向委员会保证，美国政府准备在以后与有关方面就这个问题交换意见。
    在十三日会议上发言的有印度尼西亚、波兰、英国、法国、土耳其、加拿大和其他国家的代表。印度尼西亚代表说：国民党军队留在缅甸境内是对东南亚和平的严重威胁。他提请委员会注意，蒋介石的各种组织继续支持这些匪军，他并要求联合国支持缅甸政府消除现存的威胁。波兰代表指出：国民党集团利用从美国得到的援助继续支持它在缅甸的匪军。他要求委员会考虑一个事实：国民党匪军在缅甸的抢劫行为以及他们在中国海面的海盗活动，是对世界那一部分地区的和平的严重威胁。
    英国、法国、土耳其、加拿大等国的代表在发言中企图缩小国民党匪军留在缅甸境内所构成的威胁。
    在十四日会议上发言的有乌拉圭、巴基斯坦、阿比西尼亚和印度的代表。他们都支持缅甸政府的控诉。
