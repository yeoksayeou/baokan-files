Xinhua News Agency report: World opinion in various countries generally attaches importance to the new proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation at the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.
    The Czechoslovak newspaper "Red Right" published an editorial on the 4th, saying that the Soviet Union's new proposal has become the focus of attention of the United Nations General Assembly and world opinion. The meeting and opinion justly believe that this proposal is an important step in consolidating world peace and another undeniable proof of the Soviet Union's peace policy. "Red Right" pointed out that there is no doubt that the new Soviet proposal will help bring the views of the two sides closer. It proves that the Soviet Union has made firm efforts to seek a concrete solution to the problems that make all mankind uneasy and to use the huge amount of materials currently used for military purposes to benefit mankind.
    The Hungarian newspaper "Free People" believes that this proposal is the most important event in current international life. The newspaper said: What does it mean to accept the Soviet proposal? It is no exaggeration to say that it is a turning point in international relations. After the signing of the convention on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the burden of armaments on the people of all countries can be reduced, mutual trust between countries can be strengthened, relations between major powers can be truly improved, and the threat of war can be greatly reduced.
    The Romanian newspaper "Spark" published an editorial entitled "Major Events in International Life," saying that the Soviet proposal has once again paved the way for stopping the arms race, greatly easing the international situation, and consolidating peace.
    The Bulgarian newspaper "Worker's Cause" wrote in an editorial on the 4th that this proposal is a new and significant contribution by the Soviet Union to the struggle to consolidate peace and further ease international tensions.
    The Indian "Times of India" wrote: Officials in Delhi welcome the Soviet proposal, considering it a constructive step towards reaching an international agreement on the control of weapons of mass destruction and the reduction of conventional armaments.
    The "Hindustan Standard" believes that the new disarmament plan proposed by the Soviet Union is enough to test the sincerity of Western countries on this important issue. The newspaper wrote that one of the main accusations made by the United States against the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union is unwilling to agree to the principle of international supervision. Now "this accusation is no longer valid."
    The French newspaper "Le Monde" said that Vyshinsky's speech showed that the Soviet Union "is making every effort to improve the international situation as soon as possible in order to resume negotiations on the joint control of atomic energy." "Paris Radical News" emphasized that the new Soviet proposal "is a big step forward on the road to peace and international disarmament." The Catholic newspaper "La Croix" expressed the hope that negotiations on the establishment of an "atomic pool" could be resumed in the future, and warned that continued arms expansion would only lead to disaster.
    "Liberation" published an editorial commenting on the Soviet proposal, saying: Now, French Prime Minister Mendès-France is faced with such a choice: arm Germany or universal disarmament. He chose to arm Germany. He did not fully estimate the ability of a country like France to decide its own destiny regardless of external pressure. The editorial asked him to abandon this path and rely on the support of peaceful forces to choose the path of disarmament negotiations.
    "L'Humanité" said: The nine-nation talks in London on reviving the West German army have aroused legitimate concerns and dissatisfaction among people of all countries, while at the United Nations, the Soviet Union has taken new steps to eliminate obstacles to disarmament, and the prospect of disarmament has aroused great hope. In fact, the Soviet Union has agreed to accept the proposals of France and Britain as a basis for negotiations. What better way could there be to demonstrate the Soviet Union's sincerity and desire for an agreement?
    "Franc-Tireur" said that the French Foreign Ministry is studying the Soviet proposal "with great interest."
    French representative to the United Nations Disarmament Commission, Mr. Moch, said that Vyshinsky's speech was of great significance. He said that the new Soviet proposal on disarmament will lead to fruitful efforts to seek lasting peace.
    The British "Daily Herald," in commenting on the Soviet proposal, called on Western countries to "negotiate with Russia to find out whether progress is possible." The "Manchester Guardian" believes that Vyshinsky's speech was extremely important. The newspaper said that the new Soviet proposal is to a large extent close to the Western proposal. The newspaper made the Soviet proposal seem "many questions are not clear enough," but it also advocated further study.
    The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" wrote in an editorial: "Obviously, if an international disarmament implementation plan with Soviet participation can one day take effect, then many of the decisions made in London (referring to the nine-nation meeting discussing the issue of arming West Germany - editor) will be unnecessary."
    The "Observer" correspondent in New York wrote that despite the Soviet Union's proposal for disarmament, Britain still does not want to agree to any delays in arming Germany. However, British representative Lloyd will not directly resist the overwhelming tide of optimism that Vyshinsky's speech has aroused throughout the United Nations.
    An editorial in the American "New York Times" tried to describe the Soviet proposal as "complicated" and "unclear." At the same time, it also admitted that this proposal may break the deadlock on the issue of disarmament.
    "New York Times" correspondent in the United Nations, Hamilton, commented on the Soviet proposal, saying: Due to the unexpected new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union, the prospect of establishing international supervision of atomic energy has suddenly unfolded. This issue was originally the most hopeless of all unresolved matters in the United Nations.
    The "New York Herald Tribune" said in an editorial that the Soviet Union "has taken the most promising diplomatic action in many months. This plan should be carefully studied, and the motivations contained therein should also be seriously explored."

    世界各国舆论
    普遍重视苏联的裁减军备新提案
    据新华社讯：世界各国舆论普遍重视苏联代表团在联合国大会提出的关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的新提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在四日发表社论说：苏联的新建议已成为联合国大会和世界舆论注意的中心，会议和舆论公正地认为这一建议是巩固世界和平的一个重要步骤，是苏联和平政策的又一个无可非议的明证。“红色权利报”指出，毫无疑问，新的苏联建议有助于双方观点的接近，它证明苏联作了坚定的努力，争取具体解决使全人类感到不安的问题，并把目前用于军事目的的庞大的物资拿来为人类谋幸福。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”认为，这个建议是目前国际生活中最重要的事件。报纸说：接受苏联的建议意味着什么呢？可以毫不夸大地说，就是国际关系的转折点。裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的公约签订后，各国人民肩上的军备负担就可以减轻，国际间的互信就可以加强，大国间的关系就可得到真正改善，从而可以大大减少战争威胁。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”以“国际生活中的大事”为题发表社论说，苏联的建议为制止扩充军备，再一次大大地缓和国际局势和巩固和平开辟了道路。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”四日在社论中写道，这项建议是苏联对巩固和平和进一步缓和国际紧张局势的斗争的一个新的重大贡献。
    印度“印度时报”写道：德里官方人士欢迎苏联的建议，认为这是在就管制大规模毁灭性武器和裁减常规军备问题达成国际协议方面的一个建设性的步骤。
      “印度斯坦旗报”认为，苏联提出的裁减军备新方案，足以考验西方国家在这一重要问题上的诚意。这家报纸写道，美国对苏联的主要非难之一是说苏联不愿同意国际监督的原则。现在“这一非难已经不能成立了”。
    法国“世界报”说，维辛斯基的演说，表明苏联“竭力谋求尽速改善国际局势，以恢复关于原子共储的谈判”。“巴黎激进新闻”着重说，苏联的新建议“是在争取和平和国际裁减军备的道路上前进了一大步”。天主教报纸“十字架晚报”表示希望今后能恢复关于建立“原子共储”的谈判，并警告说，继续扩充军备只会带来灾祸。
      “解放报”发表社论评论苏联的建议说：现在，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯就面临着这样一个抉择：武装德国呢，还是普遍裁军。他选择了武装德国。他没有充分估计到法国这样一个国家可以不管外界压力而自己决定自己的命运的能力。社论要求他放弃这条道路，并依靠和平力量的支持来选择进行裁军谈判的道路。
    “人道报”说：伦敦九国关于复活西德军队的谈判引起各国人民正当的忧虑和不满，而在联合国，苏联采取了足以消除裁军的障碍的新步骤，裁军的前景引起了巨大的希望。事实上，苏联已同意接受法国和英国的建议作为谈判的基础。还有什么表示能够再好地说明苏联的诚意和谋求协议的愿望呢？
    “义勇军报”说，法国外交部“以极大的兴趣”研究苏联的建议。
    法国出席联合国裁减军备委员会代表莫克说，维辛斯基的演说有很重要的意义。他说，苏联关于裁军问题的新建议将使谋求持久和平的努力取得成果。
    英国“每日先驱报”在评论苏联建议时，要求西方国家“同俄国进行谈判，弄清楚是不是可能有所进展”。“曼彻斯特卫报”认为，维辛斯基的演说是极端重要的。报纸说，苏联的新建议在很大的程度上接近了西方的建议。报纸把苏联建议说得好像“有许多问题还不够明确”，但它也主张进一步加以研究。
      “每日电讯与晨邮报”的社论写道：“显然，如果有苏联参加的国际裁减军备的执行计划有一天能生效的话，那么在伦敦（指讨论武装西德问题的九国会议——编者）所作的决议中有许多都将是不需要的了。”
      “观察家报”驻纽约记者写道，尽管苏联提出了裁减军备的建议，英国仍然不想同意对武装德国作任何延缓。但是，英国代表劳埃德不会正面抵挡维辛斯基演说在整个联合国中所引起的势不可当的乐观潮流。
    美国“纽约时报”的社论力图将苏联的建议说成是“复杂的”和“不明确的”。同时，它也承认这个建议可能打破在裁减军备问题上的僵局。
      “纽约时报”驻联合国记者汉密尔顿评述苏联的建议说：由于苏联提出了一个出人意料的新建议，建立原子能国际监督的远景突然展开了。这个问题本来是联合国中一切没有解决的事项中最没有希望的一项。
      “纽约先驱论坛报”社论说，苏联“采取了许多个月以来最令人感到希望的外交行动，这个计划应仔细研究，同样，其中所蕴藏的动机也应认真地探讨”。
