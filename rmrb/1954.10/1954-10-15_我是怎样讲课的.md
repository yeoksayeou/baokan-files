    How to give good theoretical lectures to cadres on the job? In the many experiences and lessons of success and failure, I have the following insights.
    Pay attention to lesson preparation, this is the most important thing. I divide my lesson preparation into three aspects.
    The first is to systematically study basic theoretical works and research social phenomena to improve my theoretical level and increase my practical knowledge. This constant and painstaking self-study is a prerequisite for giving good lectures. Only through years of hard study and deep drilling can one take on the arduous task of theoretical teaching.
    The second is that after the decision to teach a certain course is made, I do a rough and comprehensive study of the course and research some teaching instructions and teaching experiences related to the course, so that I can understand the basic content, key points, and teaching methods of the entire course. This comprehensive preparation work before lecturing is an indispensable task for grasping the overall teaching direction and determining specific teaching arrangements; without this preparation work, the teaching work will fall into blindness.
    The third is direct lesson preparation before lecturing, which is the key to determining the success or failure of the lecture. I have mastered the following four steps:
    Carefully reading the text is the first step. The purpose is to understand the spirit and essence of the document, grasp the overall content of the document, grasp the key points of the issue, solve problems in all aspects, and make myself thoroughly understand the document. I can not only understand the meaning in my heart, but also express it logically. I can not only make theoretical explanations, but also make practical arguments. I can not only make positive explanations, but also make analogies and criticize various negative opinions. Truly achieve a clear understanding. To achieve this, in addition to carefully studying the text and thinking independently, one must read some reference materials. The purpose of reading reference materials is to broaden ideas, clarify the arguments of the text, seek corroboration, solve problems, and supplement information. Therefore, it should not be aimless or too much. Otherwise, it may lead to confusion in understanding. Only by closely focusing on the text and the requirements of the lecture, and selecting and reading necessary reference materials according to clear purposes, can it be helpful to the teaching work.
    Understanding the teaching object is also an indispensable part of lesson preparation. Only by understanding the teaching object can we determine our teaching essentials based on the specific situation of the teaching object. The more familiar we are with the characteristics of the teaching object and the more thoroughly we research them, the greater the grasp of teaching will be. Disregarding the object and acting arbitrarily often results in great effort but little effect. The so-called understanding of the teaching object is to understand the class origin, struggle experience, work nature, cultural level, acceptance ability, and listening requirements of the listeners, etc., which are directly related to the lecture. Teachers should make their teaching content and teaching methods take into account these specific situations. Even for non-fixed students, we must try our best to find out these basic situations. Although this is very difficult, it can be generally done as long as we have good contact with the主管机关 (supervisory authority).
    Formulating a lesson plan based on the teaching material content and the student situation is the overall "design" before "construction." When formulating a lesson plan, I mainly consider the following issues: teaching objectives, lecture key points, lecture outline, and some issues that should be paid attention to in teaching according to the teaching content and teaching objects. In addition, in order to provide convenience for students, I sometimes prepare discussion and thinking questions in the lesson plan, and specify necessary reference documents (sometimes even pointing out a certain page and line of a certain book). I think the process of formulating a lesson plan is the process of integrating the text, summarizing experience, and conducting an overall layout of the lecture in combination with the student situation, and therefore it is also a process of arduous thinking.
    Writing a lecture outline is the last task of lesson preparation. My method of writing a lecture outline is: first, draft a concise lecture outline based on the lesson plan, seeking a complete system and clear organization, and then enrich the content based on the outline and write it into a more detailed outline. All places where the words of the leaders need to be quoted are copied verbatim (I do not adopt the method of flipping through books in the classroom); all places where important examples need to be cited are briefly written; when encountering some important numbers, all those including multiple items are listed in a table, and those that need to calculate percentages are calculated. Sometimes, in order to make the table clear, they are marked with different colored pens. For questions that I am not sure about but must be involved in the lecture, I mark them with obvious marks and try my best to collect various different related arguments, ready to provide them for everyone's reference during the lecture. In short, the goal is to make the outline basically complete and flawless, so that I can confidently walk into the classroom with the outline in hand.
    The process of lesson preparation is actually a process of personal painstaking self-study. Without taking out enough time and without paying hard work, the lesson cannot be prepared well. A little bit of carelessness, or relying on one's own cleverness, can cause trouble and make mistakes; it is a manifestation of political irresponsibility. "Do not fight unprepared battles" is a basic operational principle stipulated by Chairman Mao. "Do not give unprepared or insufficiently prepared lectures" should also be a basic principle of lecturing.
    Sufficient lesson preparation lays a good foundation for lecturing. Learning well is the prerequisite and decisive factor for teaching well, but learning is ultimately not equal to teaching, and lesson preparation is ultimately not equal to lecturing. To ensure that all the hard work in lesson preparation can be rewarded accordingly, we must do our best to do a good job in classroom teaching.
    The lecturing attitude must be absolutely serious and meticulous. To this end, I have established four regulations for myself to supervise and restrain myself. These regulations are:
      (1) Must be correct. This requires an extremely cautious and serious lecturing attitude, striving to have a basis for every statement, and never credulously believing those unreliable reference materials; when quoting documents, be sure to check them carefully, and never rely solely on one's own memory; on major issues such as theoretical policies and principles, if there is no certainty, never easily express opinions. If it is necessary to clarify something, first declare that this is one's own opinion; if a mistake is made and discovered in time, it should be corrected publicly on the spot, and never conceal mistakes or obliterate the truth. (2) Must be clear. A complete system, clear organization, prominent key points, and clear arguments, I think this should be the focus of attention in lecturing; messy ideas, disorganized, unclear key points, and lengthy content are the taboos of lecturing. Because only in this way can everyone easily understand and easily remember. (3) Must be popular. I follow two paths to pursue popularity: one is to try to use some popular and vivid everyday language when explaining certain difficult theoretical principles; the other is to try to explain problems through some vivid and powerful examples that are easy for everyone to understand. Pretending to be profound is actually deceiving oneself and others. (4) Must be honest. Not understanding is not understanding, not having confidence is not having confidence, and never pretending to understand or have confidence. When the lecture receives good results, we must become more aware that our responsibility is great, and more strictly check our shortcomings and pay attention to improving teaching quality. Because being complacent with a little success is a manifestation of weak political cultivation and is the root and beginning of failure.
    I think lecturing skills are also a noteworthy issue. In addition to the content of the explanation, language, tone, and posture are all indispensable elements of lecturing art. It is closely related to the success or failure of the lecture.
    In lecturing language, we must strive to be good at appropriately and skillfully conveying the content of the lecture, explaining problems concisely and accurately, using sentences that are clean and neat, lively and vivid, and full of attraction and persuasiveness. The structure should be straightforward, the levels should be clear, and it should meet the requirements of logic. To achieve this, of course, you have to work hard. The most fundamental tool for lecturers is language, and it is entirely necessary to spend some time studying language.
    In lecturing tone, the emotions of the explanation content should be accurately reflected to help everyone better understand the problem and improve everyone's interest in listening to the lecture and achieve emotional resonance with everyone. Shouting at the top of one's voice and listless humming are most likely to distract the listeners.
    In lecturing posture, we must strive to cooperate with the explanation and focus the attention of the listeners. The eyes should constantly scan the entire venue, observe the expressions of the listeners, and check the effect of the lecture. Never abandon the audience and specialize in looking at the roof, the ground, and the lecture outline. The attitude should be calm and composed, and generous, rather than making continuous "amazing" gestures, or becoming an expressionless statue. Posture, tone, and language must become a coordinated and unified body, used to jointly embody the content of the lecture, arousing the attention and interest of the audience.
    Some people think that lecturing skills are purely technical issues and do not need too much attention at all. This is not right. The quality of the lecturing content is undoubtedly a fundamental issue, but this does not mean that lecturing skills are insignificant. The same play, performed by excellent actors, has one effect, while performed by clumsy actors, it has another effect. There may be a huge difference between them, which is proof that skills affect the effect. If the students' emotions are lowered due to poor lecturing skills, affecting the learning effect, then lecturing skills are not only not a trivial issue, but an important issue.
    The issue of how to cite the words of revolutionary leaders is also an issue that must be paid attention to in lecturing methods. At the appropriate time, appropriately citing some of the instructions of revolutionary leaders can often provide everyone with more sufficient and powerful arguments, expand everyone's knowledge field, and naturally arouse everyone's interest in reading classic works of Marxism-Leninism. However, this kind of citation must be very cautious. It must not be divorced from history, far-fetched, or violate the original meaning, excerpting out of context. It must also be carefully checked to ensure that there are no mistakes. The quoted words should not be too much, too deep, or too long. If it is not necessary, you can not quote or quote less; opening your mouth is so-and-so said, closing your mouth is so-and-so said, not only will it not achieve the expected effect, but sometimes it will arouse the resentment of the students. As for citing extensively in order to boast about one's erudition, that is of course even more unacceptable.
    How to give examples is also an issue that should be paid attention to in lecturing. The basic purpose of giving examples is to use vivid real-life examples to explain theoretical principles in a popular way, open up everyone's thinking, and inspire everyone's associations. Therefore, the selection and telling of examples should be carefully considered and well-measured. My view is: the selection of examples must be based on the principle of accurately explaining the theoretical principles to be explained. Do not use examples that cannot powerfully explain any problems. At the same time, there is no need to give many examples of problems that everyone understands and is familiar with. All examples are best taken from real life and take into account the situation and characteristics of the listeners. Do not use fictitious, hypothetical, old, or detached-from-the-audience examples. When telling examples, it must be moderate. Do not be obsessed with the allure of examples and dilute or even obscure the interpretation of theoretical principles. In my lectures, I often overemphasize the exciting effect of individual examples, and somewhat relax the full explanation of theoretical issues, forming a case of "the guest overwhelms the host" and "more meat than bones." As a result, everyone often strongly remembers a few vivid examples, but does not understand what these examples are actually illustrating. In this way, the original intention of giving examples is violated, and the giving of examples becomes something that is not only unprofitable but also harmful.
    Finally, we should talk about the issue of after-class work. After a class is finished, there is often a mood of everything being fine, neither seriously checking the teaching effect nor seriously absorbing experience and lessons. The masses have problems that cannot be further solved, and they themselves cannot get corresponding improvement after a period of practice. This is a problem that must be given more attention at present. It should be emphasized that after-class work is an indispensable organic component of the entire teaching work, and is a necessary link for consolidating and deepening teaching effects, accepting experience, and improving work. In combat, it is required to "teach war through war" and "fight a battle and move forward a step." In teaching, it should also be required to teach once and move forward a step.
    Checking and deepening the teaching effect, discovering problems, and organizing answers are basic tasks after class. To understand the teaching effect, teachers should go to the students as much as possible, or at least try to listen to the students' feedback. All the large and small difficult problems raised by the students must be carefully collected, seriously treated, and given good answers. Because these problems are all what the masses themselves care about and are eager to get answers to, they must not be ignored. In the method of answering questions, different methods should be adopted according to the nature of the questions. Sometimes, the many scattered questions raised by everyone can be combined into several big questions to make comprehensive and systematic answers; sometimes, the questions raised by everyone can be arranged in order and answered item by item; sometimes, only some important questions can be selected to make detailed answers, and the remaining questions can be either glossed over in a few words, or specified reference materials and not answered. For some questions that are indeed important but cannot be answered for the time being, it is simply explained clearly and left for later resolution or to be studied and resolved together with other comrades; for some questions that are not properly raised, it can be kindly pointed out how the questions should be raised. All the questions raised should have a proper resolution, and none should be left unanswered. As for the method of answering, it can be determined according to the situation: either organize a special answering report, or answer it conveniently during the next class, or make a written answer, or find the person who raised the question to answer it individually. But as long as it is answering questions, it must be taken seriously, prepared carefully, and some problems must be solved through the answers. Answering carelessly without preparation is fundamentally wrong. The principle that should be grasped is: must answer, must adopt different methods to answer, and must answer well.
    After-class inspection is also necessary. After each lecture, teachers should widely understand opinions from all aspects and conduct strict self-examination in order to discover places of success and failure, draw certain experiences and lessons, and use them as a basis for improving teaching and improving teaching ability.
    From the above points, giving a good lecture is indeed not an easy task. Without going through "all kinds of hardships," it is indeed difficult to be competent for the teaching task. But often, after putting in a lot of effort, the lecturing effect is not very good. Therefore, it is easy to generate a sense of retreat. This is understandable. However, in any case, knowing the difficulty and retreating is definitely not the attitude we should have. We should dare to face difficulties and move forward despite difficulties. Since we are revolutionary soldiers and have learned Marxism-Leninism one step earlier and more than the comrades around us, it should be our unshirkable duty to help the comrades around us. There are of course difficulties, and many of them, but learning while teaching, studying diligently and teaching hard, and teaching and learning from each other, "Heaven will not fail those who have a heart." Sooner or later, there will be rewards. Therefore, my requirement for myself is: lecturing is a good thing, and if I can do it, I must do it; lecturing is also a difficult thing, and if I cannot do it well, I must work harder.

    我是怎样讲课的
    车文仪
      怎样把在职干部的理论课程讲好？在成功和失败的多次经验教训中，我有如下一些体会。
    注意备课，这是最重要的事情。我把自己的备课分为三方面。
    第一是有计划地研读基本理论著作，研究社会现象，来提高自己的理论水平，增加自己的实际知识。这种经常性的刻苦自学，是讲好课的先决条件。只有积年累月的苦学深钻，才有可能担当起理论教学的艰巨任务。
    第二是当讲授某门课程决定后，我就对该门课程做一次大致的通盘的学习，并研究一些有关这门课程的教学指示与教学经验，使自己能了解整个课程的基本内容、重点和讲授方法等等。这种讲课前的全面准备工作，是掌握整个教学方向，确定具体教学部署的一件绝不可缺的工作；没有这种准备工作，就会使教学工作陷于盲目。
    第三是讲课前的直接备课，这是讲课成败的决定关键，我掌握了以下四个环节：
    精读课文，是第一步。目的在于领会文件的精神实质，掌握文件的全盘内容，抓住问题的重点，解决各方面的疑难，使自己把文件钻通钻透，不仅能心知其意，而且能言之成理，不仅能做理论上的阐述，而且能做实际的论证，不仅能做正面的讲解，而且能触类旁通，批驳各种反面的意见，真正做到心里有底。为做到这一步，除了精心地研究课文，独立地进行思考之外，不能不阅读若干参考材料。阅读参考材料的目的在于开拓思路，阐明课文论点，寻求佐证，解决疑难，补充资料，因此就既不可盲无目的，又不可太多太滥。不然，反可能导致认识上的混乱。只有紧紧围绕着课文与讲课的要求，根据明确的目的，来选择与阅读必要的参考材料，才能有助于教学工作。
    认识教学对象，也是备课中的一项不可少的工作。只有了解了教学对象，才能针对教学对象的具体情况来确定自己的教学要领，对教学对象的特点越熟悉，研究的越透彻，教学的把握就越大。不看对象，自行其是，往往是费力很大而收效很小。所谓了解教学对象，就是要了解听课人的阶级出身、斗争经历、工作性质、文化程度、接受能力和听课要求等等与讲课直接有关的问题。教员要使自己的讲课内容、讲课方法都能照顾到这些具体情况。就是对于不固定的学员，也要尽力摸清这些基本的情况。这虽然很困难，但只要与主管机关联系好，是大体上可以办到的。
    根据教材内容与学员情况，来制订教案，这是
  “施工”前的整体“设计”。我在制订教案时，主要考虑以下几个问题：教学目的、讲课重点、讲课纲要以及根据教学内容与教学对象，在教学中该注意的一些问题。此外，为了给学员以方便，我在制订教案中，有时还拟好讨论与思考题目，指定必要的参考文件（有时连某书的某页某行都指出来）。我觉得制订教案的过程，就是自己融会课文、归纳心得、结合学员情况进行讲课整体布局的过程，因而也是一个艰苦思考的过程。
    编写讲课提纲，这是备课的最后一道工作。我编写讲课提纲的方法是：首先根据教案拟定简明的讲课纲要，求得体系完整，条理分明，然后根据纲要充实内容，写成较为详细的提纲。凡需引证领袖言论的地方，都一字不错的抄好（我不采取课堂上翻书的办法）；凡需举出重要例证的地方，都简要地写明；遇有一些重要数字，凡包括有多种项目者就列成表格，需计算百分数者就计算好，有时为使表格眉目清晰，就用色笔分别标出，对自己没有确实把握而在讲课中又非涉及不可的问题，就注上明显的标记，并尽力搜集各种不同的有关论点，准备在讲课时提供大家参考。总之，是要使提纲基本上完备无缺，使自己拿着提纲就能够胸有成竹地走上讲堂。
    备课的过程，实际上也是个人苦心自学的过程。不拿出足够的时间，不付出艰苦的劳动，就不能把课备好。一星一点的粗心大意，自恃聪明，都可能惹出麻烦、铸成错误；都是在政治上不负责任的表现。不打无准备的仗是毛主席规定的一项基本作战原则。不上无准备、或准备得不充分的课，也应该是讲课的一项基本原则。
    备课充分，就为讲课奠定了良好的基础。学好就是教好的先决条件与决定因素，但学终究不等于教，备课终究不等于讲课，要使备课时的一切辛劳能得到相应的报偿，还必须尽最大努力搞好课堂讲授。
    讲课态度必须绝对严肃，丝毫不苟。为此，我为自己订立了四条法规，用以督责与约束自己。这些法规就是：
      （一）必须正确。这就要讲课态度异常谨慎严肃，出言道语力求有根有据，绝不轻信那些不甚可靠的参考材料；引用文件时，一定先查对确实，绝不单纯依靠自己的记忆；在理论政策原则等重大问题上，如果没有把握，绝不轻易发挥。如果出于必要而必须有所阐明，就首先声明这是自己的见解；如果讲错而又及时发现了，就要当场公开纠正，绝不隐瞒错处，抹煞真理。（二）必须明确。体系完整、条理分明、重点突出和论点明确，我认为这应该是讲课注意的中心；头绪凌乱、毫无条理、重点不明和内容拖沓，是讲课的大忌。因为只有这样，才能使大家容易理解，容易记忆。（三）必须通俗。我依循着两条途径追求通俗：一是在阐明某些费解的理论原则时尽量运用一些通俗的形象化的日常语言；一是尽力设法通过大家易于理解的一些生动有力的事例来说明问题。故作高深实际上就是欺人自欺。（四）必须老实。不懂就是不懂，没把握就是没把握，绝不装懂，装有把握。当讲课收到较好效果时，就要益发认识到自己责任重大，更加严格检查缺点和注意提高教学质量。因为一点点成功就得意忘形，是政治修养薄弱的表现，是失败的根苗和开始。
    我认为讲课技巧也是一个值得注意的问题。除了讲解的内容之外，语言、声调、姿态，都是讲课艺术上不可忽视的要素。它与讲课的成败有密切的关联。
    在讲课语言上，必须求其善于恰当地、巧妙地传达讲课的内容，简明精确地说明问题，语句力求干净利索，生动活泼，富有吸引力与说服力，结构则要力求直捷了当，层次分明，合乎逻辑的要求。想做到这一步，当然要下苦工夫，讲课者最根本的工具就是语言，在学习语言上下点工夫是完全必要的。
    在讲课声调上，应确切体现讲解内容的情感，帮助大家更好地体会问题，并提高大家听课的兴趣，取得大家情感上的共鸣。直着嗓子叫与无精打采的哼哼，最容易使听课者情绪涣散。
    在讲课姿态上，要力求配合讲解和集中听课人的注意力。眼睛要时时巡视全场，观察听课人的表情，检查讲课的效果，千万不要抛开听众，专门去瞧房顶、瞅地皮和看讲授提纲。态度要从容不迫，落落大方，而不要连续不断地做“惊人”的手势，或成为毫无表情的塑像。姿态、声调与语言必须成为协调一致的统一体，用来共同体现讲课的内容，引起听众的注意和兴趣。
    有人认为讲课技巧是个纯技术的问题，根本不需要加以太多的注意。这是不对的。讲课内容的好坏毫无疑义是根本性的问题，但不能因此就说明讲课技巧无关轻重，同样的一场戏，优秀演员表演出来是一种效果，拙劣的演员表演出来是另一种效果。其间可能有巨大的悬殊，这就是技巧影响效果的证明。如果因讲课技巧不佳而降低了学员情绪，影响了学习收效，那讲课技巧就不仅不是个枝节问题，而是个重要的问题了。
    如何引证革命领袖的言论的问题也是讲课方法上必须加以注意的。在适当的时机，恰如其分地引用一些革命领袖们的指示，常可以使大家获得更充足有力的论据，扩展大家的知识领域，自然地激发起大家阅读马克思列宁主义经典著作的兴趣。但这种引证必须十分慎重，既不可脱离历史，牵强附会，又不可违背原意，断章取义，还必须仔细查对，保证不错。引用的文字不可太多、太深、太长，不出于必要尽可以不引或少引；开口是某某说，闭口是某某说，不仅不会收到预期的效果，有时反会引起学员的反感。至于为了夸耀自己博学多才而大肆引证，那当然更要不得。
    如何举例也是讲课中该注意的一个问题。举例的基本目的，是要通过现实的生动事例，来通俗地阐明理论原则，打开大家的思路，启发大家的联想。因此，选择和讲述例证，就应该多加思索，很有分寸。我的看法是：拣选例子必须能以确切说明所要说明的理论原则为准则，不要用那些不能有力地说明什么问题的例子，同时对大家所理解所熟悉的问题就不必多举例，所有的例子最好是取自现实生活，并照顾到听课人的情况与特点，不要使用虚构、假想、陈旧、脱离听众的事例。讲述例证时必须适可而止，不要醉心于事例的诱惑力而冲淡甚至掩蔽对理论原则的阐释。我在讲课中往往过分关心个别举例的兴奋作用，而多少放松了对理论问题的充分讲解，形成喧宾夺主，肉多骨头少，结果就往往使大家强烈地记住了几个生动事例，却弄不清这些事例到底在说明些什么问题。这样一来，就违背了举例的本意，就使举例成为一件不仅无利反而有害的事情。
    最后应该谈一谈课后工作的问题。课一讲完，往往会产生万事大吉的情绪，既不认真检查教学效果，又不认真吸收经验教训，群众有问题不能进一步求得解决，自己经过一段实践不能得到相应地提高，这是当前必须引起更多注意的一个问题。应该强调提出，课后工作乃是整个教学工作不可忽略的有机组成部分，是巩固与加深教学效果，接受经验，改进工作的必要环节。在作战上，要求“以战教战”，“打一仗，进一步”，在教学上，也应该要求教一次，进一步。
    检查与加深教学效果，发现疑难，组织解答，是课后的一项基本工作。要了解教学效果，教员就要尽可能地到学员中去，至少要设法听取学员的反映。对学员提出的大大小小的疑难问题，则必须认真汇集，严肃对待，给以很好的解答。因为这些问题都是群众自己所关心、所迫切要求得出答案的，绝不能置之不理。在解答问题的办法上，应该根据问题的性质，分别采取各种不同的方式，有时可把大家提出的许多零星分散的问题，归并成几个大问题，做综合的系统的解答；有时可把大家提出的问题，排列出次序，做逐条逐项的解答；有时可只选择一些重要问题做详尽的解答，对其余的问题则或者用三言五语带过，或者指定参考材料而不予解答。对一些确属重要但一时解答不出的问题，则干脆交代明白，留待以后解决或和其他同志共同研究解决；对一些提得不对头的问题，则可善意地指出应该怎样地提问题。所有提出的问题都应该有个适当的着落，一个都不叫它落空。至于解答的方法，则可根据情况而定：或者组织专门的解答报告，或者在下次上课时顺便解答，或者做书面解答，或者找提问题的人个别解答。但只要是解答问题，就必须郑重其事，认真准备，通过解答确实解决些问题。不经准备，敷衍塞责，轻率解答，是根本不对的。应该掌握的原则是：必须解答，必须采用不同的方式解答，必须解答得好。
    课后检查也很必要。每次讲课之后，教员都应该广泛了解各方面的意见，进行严格的自我检查，以便发现成功失败的地方，得出一定的经验教训，做为改进教学、提高教学能力的依据。
    从以上所述的各点看来，讲好一次课确实不是一件易事，不经过“千辛万苦”，的确是很难胜任教学任务的，而偏偏有许多时候，自己费了九牛二虎之力，讲课效果却很不好。因而就很容易产生退缩情绪。这是可以理解的。但是，无论如何，知难而退绝不是我们应有的态度，我们应该敢于面对困难，知难而进。我们既然是革命战士，在马克思列宁主义学习上又比周围的同志早学了一步，多学了一点，那帮助一下周围的同志，应该是义不容辞，责无旁贷的。困难当然有，而且很多，但边学边教，勤学苦教，教学相长，“老天不负苦心人”，日久天长，总会有报偿的。因此，我对自己的要求是：讲课是件好事情，能干就必须干；讲课又是件难事情，干不好就必须加油干。
