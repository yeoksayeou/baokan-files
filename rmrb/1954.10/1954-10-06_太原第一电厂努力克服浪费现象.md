    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 1st – Premier Zhou Enlai mentioned the serious waste in the construction of the new Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant (i.e., Taiyuan Heat and Power Plant) in his Government Work Report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress. On the 23rd, after listening to Premier Zhou's report, the plant's workers immediately took action and further launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. The workers all said: Premier Zhou's criticism of the waste in our construction project is a huge force driving us to improve our work. We must resolutely overcome waste and strive to save state funds as much as possible in the next few months of construction. In recent days, the CCP Taiyuan Heat and Power Plant Committee, the Taiyuan New Machine Engineering Office responsible for preparing the new plant, and the Sixth Engineering Company of the Basic Construction Engineering Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Electric Power Management Bureau, which is undertaking the construction, have all held meetings to conduct inspections, and put forward new goals and concrete plans to ensure that the construction plan is overfulfilled without exceeding this year's national investment, and that partial power generation will begin in November ahead of schedule. The New Machine Engineering Office has initially postponed two projects that can be postponed, revised the design standards of individual projects, and significantly reduced administrative management fees. As a result, it can save more than 5.5 billion yuan in national investment this year.
    In early August, the "People's Daily" published an editorial criticizing the serious waste in the construction project of the new Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant. At that time, all the workers in the plant studied this editorial and launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy to welcome the convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress and the 1954 National Day. Up to now, according to incomplete and imprecise statistics, the entire plant has processed more than 3 billion yuan of backlog materials and saved more than 2 billion yuan in project costs. In the movement, many model examples of increasing production and practicing economy have emerged. For example, all the workers in the water-cooled wall team of the boiler installation site improved and created more than ten kinds of tools such as tube expanders, pipe benders, and pad pressing machines. The work efficiency has increased from one to more than ten times, and various engineering tasks have been completed ahead of schedule, with a total value of more than 120 million yuan in increased production and savings for the country. The furnace masons completed the furnace masonry project of Boiler No. 1 five days ahead of schedule in mid-September, saving 280 million yuan in labor and material costs.

    太原第一电厂努力克服浪费现象
   【新华社太原一日电】周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中，曾提到新建太原第一发电厂（即太原热电站）建设工程中的严重浪费现象。二十三日这个厂的职工收听了周总理的报告后，立即行动起来，进一步展开了增产节约运动。职工们都说：周总理对我们建设工程中浪费现象的批评，是推动我们改进工作的巨大力量，我们要坚决克服浪费，一定在今后几个月的施工中尽量节约国家资金。连日来，中共太原热电站委员会、负责筹备新厂的太原新机工程处，和担任施工的中央燃料工业部电业管理总局基本建设工程管理局第六工程公司等单位，都分别召集了会议进行检查，并提出了新的奋斗目标和具体计划，保证在决不超过今年国家投资的基础上超额完成建设计划，提前在十一月份局部发电。新机工程处仅初步缓办了两项可以缓办的工程、修正了个别工程的设计标准和大量核减了行政管理费的结果，今年就可节省国家投资五十五亿多元。
    今年八月初“人民日报”曾经发表社论批评了新建太原第一发电厂建设工程中的严重浪费现象，当时全厂职工便学习了这一社论，开展了为迎接第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开和迎接一九五四年国庆节的增产节约运动。到目前为止，据不完全精确的统计，全厂已处理积压器材三十多亿元，节约工程成本二十多亿元。运动中出现了不少增产节约的模范事例。如锅炉安装工地水冷壁班全体工友改进和创造了涨管器、弯管器和压垫机等十多种工具，工作效率提高了一倍到十多倍，提前完成了各项工程任务，为国家增产节约的总值达一亿二千多万元。砌炉工人们在九月中旬提前五天完成一号锅炉的砌炉工程，节省工料费两亿八千多万元。
