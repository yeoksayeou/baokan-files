    Farmers Across the Country Actively Sow Wheat and Rapeseed

    Currently, wheat sowing in northern regions is nearing completion, and wheat sowing has begun in southern regions.

    This year's wheat sowing work, in many areas due to the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives and the close integration of cooperative establishment and production, has been carried out relatively promptly, and more advanced technologies have been promoted.

    Southern wheat-producing areas, based on the spirit of the National Wheat and Oil Production Conference, appropriately expanded wheat fields. The Xuzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province studied the favorable conditions for expanding wheat planting areas and plans to plant 10.5 million mu of wheat, an increase of 200,000 mu compared to last year. Yancheng County, in order to expand wheat fields, held forums with experienced farmers, focusing on the issue of converting single-season fields into double-cropping rice and wheat fields. Preliminary calculations at the meeting showed that Yancheng County has more than 670,000 mu of single-season fields. If 200,000 mu are converted into double-cropping rice and wheat fields, each mu can yield 200 jin of wheat, which can increase wheat production by 40 million jin.

   Many areas are paying attention to improving wheat planting techniques. In promoting dense planting of wheat, they are seizing the work of reforming sowing tools. Weinan Special District of Shaanxi Province, drawing on the experience of increased production through dense planting last year, comprehensively modified or newly manufactured 17,000 narrow-row drills. In the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province, 445 carpenters from 12 counties including Jieyu, Wanquan, Jishan, and Hejin were organized to conduct technical training on drill modification, and at the same time, 7,720 people were trained in dense planting techniques, so that all rural work cadres, agricultural production cooperative cadres, mutual aid team leaders, labor models, and production activists received practical education on dense planting reform. According to incomplete statistics from 35 counties in Henan Province, more than 16,000 drills have been modified. Of the 100,000 mu of wheat fields already sown in Xiuwu County, 80 percent are densely planted. In Hebei Province, dense planting accounted for only 20 percent of the province last year, but this year it generally reaches more than 30 percent. According to statistics from five counties in Baoding Special District, densely planted wheat accounts for 35 percent of the sown area.

    Currently, there are still some problems in wheat sowing work:

    First of all, in many areas, the progress of wheat sowing is still very slow and does not correspond to the agricultural season. Some cadres and masses believe that there has been plenty of rain and good soil moisture this year, so there is no rush to sow wheat; some equate establishing cooperatives with production, and even hold meetings day and night, preventing the masses from going to the fields to produce; in some areas, the guiding principles and policies for establishing cooperatives are not explained clearly, so some farmers are waiting for the cooperative to sow wheat uniformly, and some preparatory work that they should do themselves is put aside; and in many areas, water has not been drained from wheat fields. All these situations have affected the progress of wheat sowing and may even affect the completion of the wheat sowing task, which should be corrected quickly.

    Second, some areas cannot complete the wheat sowing task according to the national plan. In some areas, political and ideological education has not been carried out well, and farmers still have the idea of "fearing unified purchase" and are unwilling to plant wheat. For example, some farmers in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, want to plant less wheat and more peas, and some farmers in Henan Province want to reduce wheat fields and plant more barley. The same situation exists in Sichuan Province. Conversely, some farmers in cotton-producing areas of Hebei have a blind tendency to expand wheat fields. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen political and ideological work, correctly publicize the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and the price policy, and persuade farmers to obey the national wheat planting plan.

    Third, this year, the area of wheat sown in water-stripped land is relatively large. Generally, the cultivation is rough, the sowing quality is poor, and the emergence of seedlings is poor. The phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges is also very common in general wheat fields that are not water-stripped. Areas that have completed sowing should organize farmers to check the emergence of seedlings, carry out seedling inspection and replanting, and prevent disasters. This year, the frost period came earlier, and the weather was also colder, so we must pay close attention to preventing frost and protecting seedlings and strengthening wheat field management.

    Since the government issued the "Instructions on Mobilizing Farmers to Increase the Production of Oil Crops," the production of oil crops has been generally emphasized throughout the country, and the enthusiasm of the majority of farmers for the production of oil crops has been greatly improved. They are now working hard on sowing. According to preliminary understanding, the total area of ​​oil crops in the country next year is planned to be expanded by about 20 million mu on the basis of this year. At present, the southern provinces are actively using winter fallow fields to expand the rapeseed planting area. It is estimated that the country can expand rapeseed planting by more than 12 million mu. Among them, Hunan Province expanded by 2.5 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 1.4 million mu; Anhui Province expanded by 1.86 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 1.2 million mu; Jiangxi Province expanded by 1.39 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 420,000 mu.

    Farmers in various parts of Hunan Province are actively expanding the rapeseed planting area. Many farmers in Anhua County who have never planted rapeseed before have planted a lot of rapeseed this year. It is estimated that the rapeseed area in the county can be expanded by about ten times. Farmers in the Five-Union Group of Tanshan Township, Shaodong County, calculated an account and realized that the entire union group only sold 320 jin of rapeseed to the state this year; and the state supplied 170 jin of oil in four months, equivalent to more than 600 jin of rapeseed. Therefore, they unanimously requested to plant more rapeseed to reduce the burden on the country.

    Sichuan Province is one of the key rapeseed producing areas, and the rapeseed sowing area has not yet recovered to the pre-war level. There is great potential for expanding rapeseed planting. The province held special meetings in Chongqing and Chengdu respectively. In addition to arranging this year's rapeseed production tasks, it also specifically discussed measures to increase rapeseed production. This year, the province can expand the area of ​​improved varieties of "Japanese rapeseed" to more than 1.3 million mu, and promote effective yield-increasing measures (including seed selection, fertilization during flowering, and appropriate dense planting) to about 40 percent of the sown area.

    Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang and other provinces have also strengthened the leadership of rapeseed production, and can guarantee the completion of the original sowing plan. Zhejiang Province also held a small-scale forum, through which the expanded planting plan was specifically implemented, and the experience of increasing production was summarized and exchanged.

### 各地农民积极播种小麦和油菜

    各地农民积极播种小麦和油菜
    目前北方地区小麦播种即将结束，南方地区已开始播种小麦。
    今年的小麦播种工作，在许多地区由于农业生产合作社的大量发展，建社和生产的密切结合，进行得比较及时，并且更多地推广了先进技术。
    南方小麦产区根据全国小麦油料生产会议精神适当扩大麦田。江苏省徐州专区研究了扩大小麦种植面积的有利条件，计划种麦一千零五十万亩，比去年扩大了二十万亩。盐城县为了扩大麦田，召开老农座谈会，着重研究了一熟田改稻麦两熟田问题。会上初步计算，盐城全县有六十七万多亩一熟田，如改二十万亩为稻麦两熟田，每亩收麦二百斤，就可增产小麦四千万斤。
   许多地区都重视改进种麦技术。在推行小麦密植方面，抓紧了播种工具的改制工作。陕西省渭南专区吸取去年密植增产的经验，全面改装或新制窄行耧一万七千架。山西晋南专区解虞、万泉、稷山、河津等十二县前后共组织训练了木匠四百四十五人，进行改耧技术传授工作，同时向七千七百二十人进行了密植技术传授，使所有农村工作干部、农业生产合作社干部、互助组组长、劳动模范和生产积极分子都受到一次实际的密植改革教育。河南省据三十五个县的不完全统计改耧一万六千多张。修武县已播种的十万亩麦田，密植的占百分之八十。河北省去年全省密植仅百分之二十，今年一般的达到百分之三十以上。据保定专区五个县统计，密植的小麦占已播种面积的百分之三十五。
    目前，小麦播种工作中还存在着一些问题：
    首先是不少地区种麦进度还很迟缓，与农业季节不相适应。有的干部和群众认为今年雨多墒好，种麦不忙；有的把建社和生产对立起来，甚至日夜开会，不让群众下地生产；有的地区对建社的方针政策讲解不清，使有的农民等待社里统一种麦，自己应该做的一些准备工作也搁置不管；还有不少地区麦田积水没有排除。所有这些情况，都影响了种麦进度，甚至会影响种麦任务的完成，应迅速纠正。
    第二、有些地区不能按照国家计划完成小麦播种任务。部分地区政治思想教育工作作得不好，农民仍有“怕统购”的思想，不愿种麦。如山东莱阳县有的农民想少种小麦多种豌豆，河南省部分农民要缩小小麦田，多种大麦。四川省也有同样情况。相反的，河北棉产地区有的农民又有盲目扩大麦田的趋势。因此，要进一步加强政治思想工作，正确地宣传粮食统购统销政策和价格政策，说服农民服从国家种麦计划。
    第三、今年水脱地种麦的面积较大，一般耕作粗放，播种质量不好，出苗不良。非水脱地的一般麦田缺苗断垅现象也很普遍。已完成播种地区要组织农民检查出苗情况，进行查苗补苗，防止灾害。今年霜期来临较早，天气冷得也早，要密切注意防冻保苗，加强麦田管理工作。

    自政府发布“关于发动农民增加油料作物生产的指示”后，全国各地对油料作物生产已普遍重视，广大农民对油料作物生产的积极性已大大提高，正紧张地进行播种工作。据初步了解，全国明年油料作物总面积，计划在今年基础上扩大二千万亩左右。目前南方各省积极利用冬闲田扩大油菜种植面积，估计全国将可扩种油菜一千二百多万亩。其中湖南省扩大二百五十万亩，超过原订计划一百四十万亩；安徽省扩大一百八十六万亩，超过原订计划一百二十万亩；江西省扩大一百三十九万亩，超过原订计划四十二万亩。
    湖南全省各地农民积极扩大油菜种植面积。安化县许多从来没有种过油菜的农民，今年也都种了不少油菜，估计全县油菜面积可扩大十倍左右。邵东县檀山乡五联组的农民算了一笔账，认识到全联组今年只卖给国家三百二十斤菜籽；而国家四个月间就供应了一百七十斤油，合六百多斤菜籽。于是，一致要求多种油菜，以减少国家负担。
    四川省是油菜重点产区之一，油菜播种面积还没有恢复到战前水平，扩大油菜种植的潜力很大。该省分别在重庆、成都两地召开了专门会议，除布置了今年油菜的生产任务以外，并且具体讨论了油菜的增产措施。今年全省可扩大推广“日本油菜”良种面积到一百三十多万亩，推广有效的增产措施（包括选种、花期施肥、适当密植等）达到播种面积百分之四十左右。
    安徽、江苏、湖北、浙江等省也都加强了油菜生产的领导，都可保证完成原订播种计划。浙江省并召开了小型座谈会，通过座谈会具体地贯彻了扩大种植计划，同时还总结和交流了增产经验。
