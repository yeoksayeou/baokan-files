Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 20th. The American espionage agency "Western Enterprises Inc." is directing and training special agents on Dachen Island, constantly carrying out sabotage activities against our coastal areas of Zhejiang Province.

According to confessions from American-Chiang special agents captured or who voluntarily surrendered to our army, American "Western Enterprises Inc." operatives began activities on Dachen Island, which was entrenched by Chiang Kai-shek's forces, before August 1952. These American agents directed the activities of many Chiang Kai-shek special agent organizations on Dachen Island, collected intelligence on our country's military, political, and economic aspects, and provided funds and weapons to many local Chiang Kai-shek special agent organizations. According to Liu Liequn, a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek "National Defense Ministry Security Bureau Dachen Liaison Station" captured by our army on Toumen Island on May 15th this year, the funds for the Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization he belonged to were supplied by the American "Western Enterprises Inc. Dachen Branch" before January this year. After carrying out sabotage activities against mainland China, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents could also receive "special bonuses" from the American intelligence agency.

The American "Western Enterprises Inc. Dachen Branch" also directly trained Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and dispatched armed agents to mainland China to carry out sabotage activities. According to Qu Meidong, a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek "Dachen Defense Department Second Division" captured by our army on February 26, 1953, American agents from the "Western Enterprises Inc. Dachen Branch" personally assigned him tasks several times. In July 1952, an American agent personally ordered Qu Meidong to carry incendiary bombs into the Songmen area of Zhejiang to carry out sabotage activities. On February 24, 1953, an American agent from the "Western Enterprises Inc. Dachen Branch" assigned Qu Meidong another task. This American agent also showed photographs taken by American military aircraft when they intruded into the airspace over our coastal areas, explaining to Qu Meidong the situation in the area where he was to carry out activities.

On January 6, 1954, Chiang Kai-shek's special agent Chen Bisheng, who surrendered to our army on Tantou Island, recounted the criminal activities of the American intelligence agency on Dachen. In the winter of 1952, American agents from the American "Western Enterprises Inc. Dachen Branch" selected 24 soldiers, including Chen Bisheng, from the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched on Dachen Island, and American agents gave them four weeks of training in techniques such as rowing and demolition. After the training, these 24 people formed a demolition squad directly commanded by American agents, specializing in sneaking into mainland China to carry out criminal activities such as destroying bridges, wharves, and warehouses. The weapons and ammunition for this demolition squad were all supplied by the "Western Enterprises Inc. Dachen Branch," and the American intelligence agency gave each of them 100 New Taiwan dollars per month as a special allowance. Guo Datou, a special agent who surrendered to our army at the same time as Chen Bisheng, said that in June 1953, in order to strengthen this demolition squad, the American intelligence agency transferred some people from Chiang Kai-shek's army and sent them to the Chiang Kai-shek "National Defense Ministry Guerrilla Cadre Training Class" in Taiwan for underwater demolition training.

However, the People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces, public security forces, and the people in the coastal areas have crushed many sabotage conspiracies of the American-Chiang special agents and captured American-Chiang armed special agents who sneaked onto the mainland. The criminal activities of the American espionage agency "Western Enterprises Inc. Dachen Branch" against our country have met with a shameful failure.

    在大陈岛上的美国特务机关“西方企业公司”
    直接指挥蒋贼特务对我沿海进行破坏活动
    【新华社浙江前线二十日电】美国特务机关“西方企业公司”在大陈岛指挥和训练特务人员，对我浙江省沿海地区不断地进行破坏活动。
    据被我军捕获和自动向我军投诚的美蒋特务分子供述，在一九五二年八月以前，美国“西方企业公司”的特务分子多人，就开始在蒋贼盘踞的大陈岛上进行活动。这些美国特务人员指挥着蒋贼在大陈岛的许多特务机构的活动，收集有关我国军事、政治、经济等各方面的情报，并且供给当地许多蒋贼特务机关经费和武器。据我军在今年五月十五日在头门山俘获的蒋贼“国防部保密局大陈联络站”的特务分子刘烈群供称，在今年一月以前，他所在的蒋贼特务机构的经费，就是由美国“西方企业公司大陈分公司”供给的。在执行对我国大陆的破坏活动后，蒋贼特务人员还可以得到美国特务机关的
  “特别奖金”。
    美国“西方企业公司大陈分公司”还直接训练蒋贼特务人员和派遣武装特务人员向我国大陆进行破坏活动。据一九五三年二月二十六日被我军捕获的蒋贼“大陈防守部第二处”特务分子瞿梅冬供称，“西方企业公司大陈分公司”的美国特务人员曾数次亲自向他布置任务。一九五二年七月，一个美国特务人员曾亲自命令瞿梅冬携带燃烧弹潜入浙江松门地区，进行破坏活动。一九五三年二月二十四日，“西方企业公司大陈分公司”的一个美国特务人员又向瞿梅冬布置任务。这个美国特务人员并拿出美国军用飞机侵入我国沿海地区上空时拍摄的照片，向瞿梅冬说明要他去进行活动的地区的情况。
      一九五四年一月六日，在坛头山向我军投诚的蒋贼特务分子陈必胜讲述了在大陈的美国特务机关的罪恶活动。在一九五二年冬天，美国“西方企业公司大陈分公司”的美国特务人员在盘踞大陈岛的蒋贼军队中抽调了包括陈必胜在内的二十四名士兵，由美国特务人员向他们进行了四个星期的划船和爆破等技术训练。训练结束后，这二十四人就组成
  一个由美国特务人员直接指挥的爆破班，专事潜入我国大陆进行破坏桥梁、码头和仓库等罪恶活动。这个爆破班的武器、弹药等全部由“西方企业公司大陈分公司”供给，美国特务机关每月发给他们每个人伪台币一百元作为特别津贴。和陈必胜同时向我军投诚的特务郭大头说，在一九五三年六月，美国特务机关为加强这个爆破班，又从蒋贼军中抽调了一些人，送到台湾蒋贼“国防部游击干部训练班”进行水底爆破训练。
    但是，中国人民解放军海防部队和公安部队及沿海地区人民，粉碎了美蒋特务分子的多次破坏阴谋，捕捉了潜登大陆的美蒋武装特务分子。美国特务机关“西方企业公司大陈分公司”对我国进行的罪恶活动，遭到了可耻的失败。
