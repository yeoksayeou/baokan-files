Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 15th: According to TASS, on October 12th, the French National Assembly re-debated the London Agreement, which reconstructs the West German army, thus creating a practical threat to French security. Considering the French people's firm opposition to any attempt to revive the German Wehrmacht under any new guise, Prime Minister Mendès-France raised a vote of confidence in order to coerce the parliament with a government crisis to obtain support for his policies.

It is worth noting that the issue is not only the ratification of the London Agreement, but also, in principle, supporting Mendès-France's position at the London Nine-Power Conference to continue negotiations on the issue of arming West Germany.

In order to obtain the support of as many members of parliament as possible, the government also adopted a method. On the eve of the confidence vote, it was decided to increase the wages of some of the lowest-paid workers.

Today, at the beginning of the meeting, members spoke on the reasons for their votes. General Billotte and Mr. Palewski, representative of the former Gaullist parliamentarians (now called Social Republicans), said they would vote to trust the government. Paul Aubry, a member of the Radical Socialist Party to which Mendès-France belongs, also advocated trusting the government. He was the one who proposed the motion of confidence to be voted on by parliament.

Pierre Cot, a member of the Progressive Republican Union, criticized the London Agreement in his speech. He said he would vote against the motion of confidence. He strongly advocated that France and the Soviet Union must maintain friendly relations. Paul Reynaud, a right-wing member of the Independent Republican Party, also opposed the London Agreement. He said that he and his friends opposed "legitimizing the revival of the German Wehrmacht." He severely attacked those parliamentarians who previously opposed the rearmament of Germany but have now changed their positions.

Guy Mollet, the representative of the Socialist Party parliamentary group, said that the Socialists would vote to trust the government.

René Pleven, a member of the Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance and formerly a supporter of the "European Defense Community," criticized the London Agreement in its current form, believing that an alliance with Germany was dangerous for France. He said he would abstain from voting. Édouard Daladier, a member of the Radical Socialist Party who previously opposed the "European Defense Community," has now changed his position. After making some reservations, he said he would vote to trust the government. However, he said he believed that negotiations must continue with the Soviet Union in order to achieve disarmament.

Pflimlin spoke on behalf of the Popular Republican Party parliamentary group, which has presided over French foreign policy since the post-war period. He raised some reservations about the London Agreement, saying that members of the Popular Republican Party parliamentary group would abstain from voting.

Subsequently, the motion of confidence in the government was put to a vote. As a result, the motion was passed by 350 votes to 113. The remaining 164 members abstained or did not participate in the vote.

    法总理提出信任问题要挟议会支持伦敦协议
    国民议会投票结果竟通过了信任案
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：十月十二日，法国国民议会重新辩论关于重建西德军队从而对法国安全造成实际威胁的伦敦协议。孟戴斯—弗朗斯总理考虑到法国人民坚决反对在任何新的幌子下复活德国国防军的任何企图，提出了信任问题，以便用政府危机对议会进行要挟而取得对自己政策的支持。
    值得注意的是：问题不仅是批准伦敦协议，而且是原则上支持孟戴斯—弗朗斯在伦敦九国会议上的立场，以继续就武装西德问题进行谈判。
    政府为了取得尽可能多的议会议员的支持，又采取了一种办法。在信任投票的前夕，决定提高一些工资最低的劳动者的工资数额。
    今天，会议开始时，议员们就投票理由进行发言。毕约特将军和前戴高乐派议员（现称为社会共和党人）的代表巴列夫斯基说：他们将投票信任政府。孟戴斯—弗朗斯所属的激进社会党的议员保罗·奥布里也主张信任政府。就是他提出的这个信任案要受到议会表决。
    进步共和联盟议员皮埃尔·戈特在发言中指责伦敦协议。他说，他将投不信任票。他竭力主张必须使法国和苏联保持友好关系。独立共和党右派议员保罗·雷诺也反对伦敦协议。他说，他和他的朋友反对“使复活德国国防军合法化”。他严厉地攻击那些以前反对重新武装德国，而现在改变了自己立场的议员。
    社会党议会党团代表纪埃说，社会党人将投票信任政府。
    民主社会抵抗联盟议员雷纳·普利文以前是拥护“欧洲防务集团”的，但是，他指责目前形式的伦敦协议，他认为和德国结成联盟对法国是危险的。他说，在投票时他将弃权。激进社会党议员爱德华·达拉第以前是反对“欧洲防务集团”的，现在他改变了自己的立场，他在提出一些保留条件之后说，他将投票信任政府。可是，他说：他认为必须和苏联继续进行谈判，以便达到裁减军备的目的。
    代表战后以来一直主持法国的外交政策的人民共和党议会党团发言的是普夫朗朗。他就伦敦协议提出了一些保留条件，他说，人民共和党议会党团议员在投票时将弃权。
    接着，关于信任政府的提案付诸表决。结果这一提案以三百五十票对一百一十三票而被通过。其余有一百六十四名议员在表决时弃权或不参加投票。
