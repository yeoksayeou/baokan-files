    First Winter Construction Experience Exchange Conference Held
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Central Construction Engineering Department, according to the instructions of the State Planning Commission, in coordination with relevant industrial ministries, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Water Resources, etc., convened the first National Winter Construction Experience Summary and Exchange Conference from September 20th to 29th. More than 300 on-site construction technicians and construction management personnel from various departments and different regions attended the conference. At the meeting, construction units from seven different temperature zones gave typical reports on their winter construction experience. These experiences proved that winter construction can be carried out regardless of whether the temperature is minus 35 degrees Celsius in the North Manchuria region, or whether it is the windy and rainy Wushaoling mountain range at an altitude of 3,000 meters, or whether it is concrete engineering or bricklaying engineering. These experiences also prove that organizing winter construction and overcoming the seasonal limitations of the construction industry are of great significance for accelerating the speed of China's socialist industrialization and for overcoming the waste of manpower, financial resources, and materials in the construction industry.
    The conference widely discussed the winter construction experiences of various units in various projects, and focused on studying the preparatory work for winter construction. Soviet experts were also invited to give reports, which greatly increased confidence in promoting winter construction. After the meeting, many units, in conjunction with the spirit of this conference, arranged for the preparatory work for winter construction of key projects based on needs and possibilities.

    冬季施工经验交流大会首次举行
    【本报讯】中央建筑工程部根据国家计划委员会的指示，协同有关工业部及铁道部、交通部、水利部等部门，于九月二十日至二十九日召开了全国第一次冬季施工经验总结交流大会。参加大会的有各个部门来自各个不同地区的现场施工技术人员和施工管理人员共三百多人。会上，有七个不同气温地区的施工单位作了冬季施工经验的典型报告。这些经验证明，不论是气温在摄氏零下三十五度的北满地区，不论是拔海三千公尺的风雨覆盖的乌鞘岭，不论是混凝土工程，不论是砌砖工程，都可以进行冬季施工。这些经验也证明，组织冬季施工，克服建筑工业季节性的限制，对于加速我国社会主义工业化的速度，对于克服建筑工业人力、财力、物力的浪费，都有重大意义。
    大会广泛讨论了各个单位各项工程冬季施工的经验，并着重研究了冬季施工的准备工作，又请苏联专家作了报告，大大提高了推行冬季施工的信心。会后，许多单位都结合这次大会的精神，根据需要与可能，布置了重点工程冬季施工的准备工作。
