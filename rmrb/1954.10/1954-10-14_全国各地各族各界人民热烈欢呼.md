    People of All Nationalities and Circles Across the Country Warmly Cheer
    Shanghai City
    The people of Shanghai warmly support the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué. On the morning of the 12th, the Shanghai newspapers carrying the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué were immediately sold out, and the newspaper offices hurriedly printed more than 20,000 additional copies. The city's factories, government offices, schools, and neighborhood radios and blackboard bulletins all reported this major news. Large red cloths with the words "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Solidarity" were hung on the main docks on both sides of the Huangpu River. Workers at the Huaihai Road Wharf put slogans supporting the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué on all loading and unloading tractors.
    Wang Jusheng, a national model worker in the textile industry and deputy director of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, who had just returned from Beijing after attending the First Session of the First National People's Congress, said excitedly after reading the communiqué: "We already have a powerful weapon to build a socialist society—the Constitution. Now, the Soviet Union is giving us more selfless help, and our speed in building a socialist society will be even faster." At the construction site of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, model workers Lu Jinkang, Cao Xiaoqi, and others held a discussion during their lunch break, all expressing their determination to work harder to complete the building on schedule so that the people of Shanghai can see the achievements of Soviet economic and cultural construction that will be exhibited here soon. Workers at the state-owned Shanghai Yimin Food Factory, which is manufacturing Soviet orders, said that they must improve the quality of their products, reduce costs, and make the canned fruits and meats supplied to the Soviet Union more suitable to the tastes of the Soviet people, and increase exports to exchange for more heavy industrial equipment.
    People in Shanghai's science and technology circles are particularly interested in the joint communiqué on the signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement. Zhao Zukang, deputy director of the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies, and Cheng Xiaogang, director of the Department of Transportation and Lifting Machinery of Jiaotong University, are both deputies to the National People's Congress who have just returned from meetings in Beijing. Zhao Zukang said: "This agreement is a great encouragement to people engaged in scientific and technological work." Cheng Xiaogang said: "The Soviet Union selflessly provides us with valuable scientific and technological experience, and we ourselves should make redoubled efforts to make creations in science and technology."
    Liu Simu, the person in charge of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, said: "This meeting between China and the Soviet Union will further promote the friendship between the two countries. The unity and close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, two major countries, have a decisive significance and far-reaching impact on the security and peace of Asia and the world. The despicable conspiracy of the enemies of peace to slander the Soviet Union and sow discord in Sino-Soviet relations will be further bankrupted."
    Xinjiang Province
    People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province wholeheartedly support the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué. Employees of all ethnic groups in the Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Company cheer the further development of Sino-Soviet friendship. When Zhao Zixing, the head of the Propaganda Department of the company's Party Committee, reported the contents of the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué to the employees in Urumqi, the employees repeatedly applauded, chanting: "Thank you to the Soviet people for their selfless assistance!" "Work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union!" "Long live the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance!" Liu Hao, an engineer in the Production Technology Department, said: "During the period of economic recovery in our country, the Soviet government helped us establish the Metals Company, the Petroleum Company, and the Civil Aviation Company, and trained a large number of technical personnel and management cadres for us. Now, the Soviet government has decided to completely transfer the Soviet shares in each company to our country. This great and selfless friendship is truly grateful to us. After the transfer of Soviet shares to our country, our responsibility will be even greater. We must redouble our efforts to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, learn from the internationalist spirit of the Soviet people, and strive for the construction of our motherland, for the consolidation of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance, and for the defense of world peace!" Barat Niyaz (Uyghur), an electrical repair worker, said: "The Soviet people are truly the most loyal friends of the Chinese people. Before I came to the company, I was still a shepherd; after more than two years in the company, because of the patient education of the Soviet comrades, I have become a fourth-grade worker. We Chinese people will never forget the help the Soviet people have given us." Laimutuer Rouzi (Uyghur), the leader of the fitter group in the Construction Department, said: "Before I came to the Metals Company, I was an ordinary bricklayer, and now I am a sixth-grade worker and also the leader of the group. This is all thanks to the Soviet comrades' help. We must make a hundred times more effort to learn from the Soviet Union and never disappoint the expectations of the Soviet elder brother."
    Employees of all ethnic groups of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 12th. When Yang Qingmin, chairman of the trade union, read the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué, the workers applauded excitedly again and again. Walis (Kazakh), deputy manager of the Oil Production Department of the company, said: "When the Soviet government and our country jointly established the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company in 1950, the original mining area was very dilapidated. With the help of Soviet experts and Soviet employees, we have turned a desolate Gobi Desert into a beautiful oil city and trained a large number of skilled workers in the past few years. By 1953, more than 90 percent of the workers who mastered drilling were Chinese workers. I myself have also grown up with the help of Soviet friends. In the future, we must work harder and, with the help of Soviet friends, build our motherland better." Mutalifu Reheman (Uyghur), the leader of the ironworker group in the Construction Department and a model worker, said: "In the past five years, the Soviet elder brother's help to our Chinese people has been endless. Before I came to the company, I could only do some simple ironwork. After coming to the company, with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, my skills improved rapidly, and now I can make complex parts for general construction use. In order to thank the Soviet experts for their help and to consolidate the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance, I guarantee that I will work harder in the future to learn advanced Soviet science and technology, unite all comrades in the group to complete the production plan on time, and contribute my greatest strength."
    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    The Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué brought great excitement and encouragement to the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Hu Zhaoheng, deputy director of the Planning Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said: "According to the agreement between the governments of China, the Soviet Union, and the Mongolian People's Republic, our country is building a railway from Jining via Erlian to the Chinese border in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; this will play a great role in our country's socialist industrialization and will also fundamentally change the economic, political, and cultural life of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The people of Inner Mongolia will work even harder to support the construction of the Ji(ning)-Er(lian) Railway in the future."
    Railway employees who are building the Ji(ning)-Er(lian) Railway proposed to increase the track laying speed from 2.8 kilometers per day to 3.2 kilometers after seeing the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué, striving to complete the task as soon as possible. Zhang Qinghe, a model worker in the bridge engineering team, said: "We must build the railway as soon as possible to link China, the Soviet Union, and the Mongolian People's Republic more closely together!"

    Zhejiang Province
    People from all walks of life in Zhejiang Province warmly support the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué. In factories, schools, and agricultural production cooperatives, people are reading the communiqué and singing "Moscow-Beijing."
    Zhou Gengsheng, an industrial labor model at the state-owned Hangzhou General Machinery Factory, said, "Our workers have deeply realized the preciousness and greatness of Sino-Soviet friendship from learning advanced Soviet operating methods such as multi-tool multi-edge and high-speed cutting. This friendship is a guarantee for us to carry out socialist construction." After reading the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué, the members of the Huhang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wulong Township, Hangzhou suburbs, held a discussion on the field ridge, discussing selling all of this year's ramie to the state and striving to run the agricultural production cooperative well. Shen Jifa, the production officer, said, "The Soviet elder brother is making such a great effort to help us build a socialist society, we must be more active in running the agricultural production cooperative well." In many schools, teachers and students warmly cheered the further development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship. After Cheng Rongju, the principal of Hangzhou Normal School, read the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué to the teachers and students of the whole school, applause and cheers shook the whole school. They unanimously shouted, "Long live the great Sino-Soviet friendship!" Hong Shilu, the president of Zhejiang Medical College and a parasitologist, said, "During the period of economic recovery in our country, the Soviet Union gave us great help in science and technology. Now, the Soviet Union has signed a scientific and technological cooperation agreement with our country, which has greater significance for our country's socialist construction. We scientific workers must support the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué with practical actions."

    Kunming City
    The communiqué of the Sino-Soviet talks was transmitted to Kunming on the morning of the 12th. All of Kunming, from government offices to factories, from barracks to rural areas, from schools to streets, were excited and enthusiastically supported it.
    The 567 representatives of the First Yunnan Provincial Youth Congress, which is being held in Kunming, excitedly sang "People of the World Are of One Mind" after the secretary-general of the congress read the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks. Li Zhuyun, a Yi youth and first-class labor model from Gejiu Tin Mine, said, "In order to thank the Soviet elder brother for his sincere friendship, I must humbly learn the advanced experience of Soviet mining after I return to the factory, and guarantee the completion of the national production plan!" More than a dozen ethnic representatives participating in this conference, including Dai representative En Saimobao, Blang female representative Wang Muguo, Lisu representative Hei Ana, and Hani representative Chen Youliang, expressed their heartfelt support for the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué at the discussion, and wanted to strengthen the organization of joint defense teams, consolidate national unity, defend the border, and support the actual work of liberating Taiwan.
    All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming cheered the further development of Sino-Soviet friendship. Wei Xiaotang, a special-class hero of the Yunnan Military Region who went to Moscow to watch the ceremony on May 1st International Labor Day this year, excitedly recalled the series of assistance the Soviet Union has given to our country from the First Domestic Revolutionary War in China to the period of socialist construction in our country, and finally said with emotion: "The Soviet Union's help to us, our people will never forget!"
    Workers in factories and mines in Kunming and farmers in the suburbs all expressed their heartfelt gratitude and unparalleled excitement for the Soviet government's selfless assistance. The Niu Rusen group of Yunnan Iron Factory learned the Soviet high-speed cutting method at the end of 1951, which increased the cutting efficiency of old lathes by 17 times. After seeing the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué, they all said, "The Soviet people care about us, just like caring about their own brothers!" Zheng Jiaxing, an old "February 7" worker who is still working on the railway, said excitedly after learning the content of the Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué: "The trains that could not be dragged and pulled during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries can now be 'over-axle'. This is all thanks to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." He and another "February 7" old worker, Tan Rongzhi, both expressed that they would better learn the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, do a good job in railway work, and support national construction.

    Every newspaper reading column in Kaifeng City is crowded with people. Many factories, government offices, and street residents collectively read newspapers and hold discussions. When the employees of Kaifeng Railway Station read the communiqué on the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty Railway and the Jining-Ulan Bator Railway, they said excitedly: The Soviet Union helped us build these two railways, which will not only make Sino-Soviet relations closer, but also make our country's transportation more active, which can accelerate our country's socialist construction. They affectionately marked these two railway lines on the map with small flags. They also enthusiastically discussed how to further improve the efficiency of future work on the basis of promoting advanced experiences such as Li Xikui's shunting method and Yang Maolin's loading method.
