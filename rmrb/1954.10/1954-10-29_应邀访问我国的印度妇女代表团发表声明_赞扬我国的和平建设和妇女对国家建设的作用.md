Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 28th: The Indian Women's Delegation, led by Mrs. Ammu Swaminathan, consisting of nine members (the delegation originally had ten members, one of whom left China on the 15th), who were invited by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to attend the National Day celebrations and visit China, arrived in Guangzhou on the 24th. Eight members of the delegation left Guangzhou on the morning of the 25th via Hong Kong to return to their country.

Before their departure, the delegation issued a statement signed by all the representatives, the full text of which is as follows:

We, ten women representing different social, cultural, and political spheres of India, came to China at the invitation of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to participate in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1954, and to understand the progress China has made in education, society, and economy. Our visit is a goodwill visit, and we bring the respect of Indian women to Chinese women, and to promote friendship and understanding between our two great nations. Our four-week visit has come to an end, and we are happy to say that we believe we have achieved our purpose.

The warm hospitality and care given by our Chinese hostesses, as well as the opportunity to have close contact with delegations from distant countries such as France, Japan, Indonesia, South Africa, Vietnam, and Italy, have laid a good foundation for goodwill and friendship among international women. We hope this foundation will strengthen world peace.

During our visit, our hostesses spared no effort to arrange a wide-ranging program for our visit. We are deeply grateful for this kindness, as it more clearly reflects the large-scale efforts that China is currently undertaking for comprehensive development. Although it is impossible to write down all our various impressions in detail here, we are all deeply moved by China's efforts to achieve its goals and the important role Chinese women play in these achievements. We visited nurseries, schools, vocational schools, universities, ethnic minority institutes, factories, cooperatives, a collective farm, a court handling divorce cases, and so on. We visited the homes of workers, farmers, and capitalists. What impressed us most was the enthusiasm of the masses, the industrial achievements of the country, and the brilliant record of cultural achievements that appeared before our eyes when we were invited to participate in the four-hour National Day parade on October 1st. This gave us an impressive understanding of China today. It was an unforgettable spectacle, especially when men, women, and children passed the reviewing stand where Chairman Mao Zedong and his government officials were standing, expressing their spontaneous and enthusiastic cheers to him.

Most of our travels took place in eastern China. Of course, of all the places we visited in eastern China, our stay in Beijing was the longest. There, through the organization and staff of the Federation, we learned how Chinese women, who were previously bound by feudal customs and mostly illiterate, are today playing a significant role in the renovation of their country. In every place we visited, we saw women holding very responsible positions in the central and local governments, in factories, and in collective farms. We are pleased to see that the rights guaranteed to women by the Constitution and the Marriage Law have been realized, and we are also pleased to see that many women who were oppressed and humiliated before liberation have now been given various opportunities, and as a result, they have become famous model workers and even national representatives. The encouragement and commendation of workers who have achieved outstanding production results or made new inventions are commendable. Construction is underway wherever we go. We are very proud that our Chinese sisters have played such a significant role in improving the conditions of their country. We visited educational institutions and learned about the government's efforts to solve the huge problem of educating millions of illiterate people. We are pleased to see that all higher education is completely free, and that graduates not only have jobs immediately, but that New China needs more people.

In the agricultural cooperatives and collective farms we visited, we saw how the various efforts for cooperative farming are producing good results, and the farmers there are looking forward to a better future. We met a farmer who was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, which proves that there are no obstacles to their rise to the highest position. We were very happy to have the good fortune to meet Premier Zhou Enlai and Madame Soong Ching Ling. We sincerely hope that the Five Principles put forward in the joint statement of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru will lead to understanding and peace among all countries in the world. We have seen the Chinese people's desire for peace. We Indian women and our Chinese sisters are peace-loving, and we must unite and do everything in our power to ensure the strengthening of friendship and understanding between the people of our two countries and thus safeguard world peace. We congratulate our Chinese sisters on their achievements, and sincerely hope that their efforts to promote international understanding among women will be effective and that world peace and happiness will be realized. Once again, we sincerely thank them for their care and love during our visit, and thank them for making this visit so pleasant and comfortable. Long live the Chinese people!

    应邀访问我国的印度妇女代表团发表声明
    赞扬我国的和平建设和妇女对国家建设的作用
    【新华社广州二十八日电】应中华全国民主妇女联合会邀请前来参加我国国庆观礼和访问的、以安穆·斯瓦米纳坦夫人为首的印度妇女代表团一行九人（代表团共十人，其中一人已在十五日离开我国）在二十四日到达广州。代表团中八人已在二十五日上午离广州经香港回国。
    行前，代表团发表了一份由全体代表签名的声明，全文如下：
    我们十位代表印度不同的社会、文化和政治的妇女，应中华全国民主妇女联合会的邀请，来到中国参加一九五四年十月一日中华人民共和国建国五周年庆祝典礼，以及了解中国在教育、社会和经济方面所获得的进展。我们这次访问是一次亲善的访问，我们给中国妇女带来了印度妇女的敬意，并且为增进我们两个大国之间的友谊和谅解。我们四星期的访问已经结束，我们很高兴地说：我们认为我们已达到了我们的目的。
    我们的中国女主人所给予的热情招待和照料，以及和来自远方的国家——如法国、日本、印度尼西亚、南非、越南和意大利——的代表团发生密切接触的机会已打下了国际妇女间的亲善和友谊的良好基础。我们希望这种基础将加强世界和平。
    在我们访问的期间，我们的女主人不遗余力地为我们的访问安排了广泛的计划。我们深切地感激这种好意，因为它更清楚地反映了中国今天为了全面的发展所正在进行的大规模的努力情况，虽然不可能在这里把我们各种各样的感想都详细地写出，但是我们都因中国为了达到它的目的所作的努力，以及中国妇女们在这些成就中所起的重要作用而深受感动。我们参观了托儿所、学校、专科学校、大学、民族学院、工厂、合作社、一所集体农庄，正在办理离婚案件的法庭等等。我们访问了工人、农民和资本家的家庭。最使我们受到感动的是我们被邀参加十月一日长达四小时的国庆节游行观礼时所出现于我们眼前的群众的热情、国家的工业成就以及文化成就的精采纪录。这使我们对于今日的中国有了一种印象深刻的了解。这是一种令人难忘的壮观，特别是当男人、妇女和儿童们经过毛泽东主席和他的政府的人员所站的观礼台时向他所发出的自发的和热烈的欢呼。
    我们的旅行大部分是在中国东部进行的，在中国东部访问的各个地方中，当然我们在北京逗留的时间是最久了。在那里，我们通过联合会的组织和工作人员了解到以前因封建习俗而被束缚在家庭中而且大多数不识字的中国妇女，今天如何在她们国家的革新工作中起着很大的作用。在我们访问的每一个地方都看到妇女们如何在中央政府和地方政府中，在工厂和集体农庄中担负一些十分负责的职位。我们很高兴地看到，宪法和婚姻法所保证给予妇女的权利已经实现了，而且我们也很高兴地看到许多在解放前受压迫受侮辱的妇女今天已得到了各种机会，结果他们成为著名的模范工人，甚至成为全国的代表。对于取得杰出的生产成绩或有了新发明的工人的鼓励和表扬，是值得推荐的事情。我们所到之处都在进行建设。我们的中国姐妹们在改善她们国家状况的工作中起了这样重大的作用使我们感到很骄傲。我们参观了教育机关，知道了政府在解决使千百万不识字的人受教育的这个巨大问题上所作的努力。我们很高兴地看到所有的高等教育都是完全免费的，而毕业生不仅是立刻有工作，而且新中国还需要更多的人。
    在我们访问的农业合作社和集体农庄里，我们看到为合作经营农业而进行的各种工作如何产生良好效果的情形，看到那里的农民都在指望着更好的前途。我们会到了一位被选为全国人民代表大会代表的农民，这证明了他们上升到最高的地位是没有阻碍的。我们很高兴能有会见周恩来总理和宋庆龄夫人的幸运。我们诚恳地希望周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的联合声明里所提出的五项原则，会导致世界各国间的谅解与和平。我们已经看到中国人民要求和平的意志。我们印度妇女和我们中国的姊妹们都是爱好和平的，我们要团结起来尽我们的一切力量来保证加强两国人民之间的友谊和谅解从而维护世界和平。我们祝贺我们中国姊妹们的成就，并且诚恳地希望她们这种促进国际妇女间谅解的努力会收到效果，世界的和平与幸福得以实现。我们再一次诚恳地感谢她们在我们访问期间对我们的照顾和爱护，并且感谢她们使得这次访问非常愉快和舒适。中国人民万岁！
