After the announcement of the order on planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth, all the salespersons of the colored cloth group of the Second Store of Beijing Department Store immediately held a meeting to study how to specifically implement the country's order in their work. In the discussion, all comrades in the group realized that they were the specific executors of the planned supply of cotton cloth, and the success or failure of the implementation of the cotton cloth planned purchase and planned supply order was directly related to the quality of their work. Therefore, everyone firmly guaranteed that they would study policies hard, improve service attitude, better take care of customers' requirements and preferences, and strive to implement the country's policy of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth.

Before the implementation of the planned supply of cotton cloth, we did not fulfill our due responsibilities to customers. We sold whatever the customers wanted to buy, and rarely cared whether the size was appropriate or the color was satisfactory after the customers bought it. Sometimes, when customers were choosing colors and varieties, some shop assistants were impatient and had a very bad attitude; our invoicing and other procedures were not simple either, costing customers a lot of time. Now, we deeply feel that this situation is not allowed to continue.

Being highly responsible to customers should become the action guideline of every salesperson. In the past, when cotton cloth was freely purchased, consumers could buy again if they bought inappropriate or unsatisfactory cloth; now, the purchase of cloth is rationed, and customers will be unhappy if they buy inappropriate cloth. Therefore, this requires us to strive to take care of customers' requirements and preferences, help customers buy the cloth they love, and make them dress themselves more appropriately and live a better life within the scope of the rationed cotton cloth. This is an important task for us to implement the order on planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth.

Now, many people are not used to buying cloth with certificates; many customers are also not familiar with the method of using cloth coupons; in addition, the added procedure of checking cloth coupons when buying cloth prolongs the time for customers to buy cloth. This shows that we must publicize the state's policy of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and the method of supplying cotton cloth with certificates to customers at any time. In addition, we must improve work efficiency. Now, in addition to temporarily adding three salespersons, the entire group is strengthening the study of business skills in the form of "teaching, ensuring learning, ensuring teaching," and is preparing to continue to promote the card sales method and improve the method of collecting cloth coupons to improve our business skills and shorten customers' waiting time, and serve customers more thoughtfully.

    改善服务态度，做好棉布计划供应工作
    北京市百货公司第二门市部色布组组长  刘兆东
    实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的命令公布以后，我们北京市百货公司第二门市部色布组的全体营业员，立即开会研究如何在自己的工作中具体贯彻执行国家的这项命令。在讨论中，全组同志都认识到自己是棉布计划供应的具体执行者，棉布计划供应的命令贯彻得好和坏，和自己工作的好和坏有着直接的关系。因此，大家坚决保证，要努力学习政策，改善服务态度，更好地照顾顾客的要求和喜好，为贯彻国家的棉布计划收购计划供应的政策而努力。
    在实行棉布计划供应以前，我们对顾客并没有尽到应尽的责任，顾客买什么，就卖什么，很少关心顾客买到手以后，尺寸是否合适，花色是否满意。有时顾客选择花色品种时，有些店员同志还表现得不耐烦，态度很不好；我们开发票等的手续也不简便，化费去顾客很多时间。现在，我们深深感到这种情况是不允许再继续存在了。
    对顾客高度负责应该成为我们每个营业员的行动方针。过去棉布自由购买，消费者买了不合适或不称心的布料后，还可能再买；现在买布定量，顾客如果买了不合适的布，就会不高兴。因此，这就需要我们努力照顾顾客的要求和喜好，帮助顾客购买到他们所心爱的布，使他们用定量范围内的棉布，把自己装扮得更合适些，把生活过得更美好些。这是我们贯彻执行棉布计划收购和计划供应命令的重要任务。
    现在，很多人还不大习惯，凭证买布；还有不少顾客对使用布票的办法也不太熟悉；再加上买布时增加了查点布票的一层手续，这就延长了顾客买布的时间。这说明，我们必须随时向顾客宣传国家的棉布计划收购和计划供应政策和棉布凭证供应的办法。此外，我们还必须提高工作效率。现在，我们除临时增添了三个营业员以外，全组正以保教保学的方式加强业务技术的学习，并准备继续推行卡片售货法，改进收点布票的办法，以提高我们的业务技术水平，缩短顾客等待时间，更周到地为顾客服务。
