    Sino-Soviet Friendship at the Foot of the Tianshan Mountains
    ——A Record of the Xinjiang Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation
    Zong Bian
    On March 27, 1950, China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement in Moscow to establish two joint Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies: a petroleum company and a non-ferrous and rare metals company. Shortly after the agreement was signed, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation was established.
    The Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation is located in the Gobi Desert at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang. Over the past few years, this place has become a bustling and beautiful oil mining area. People who come here cannot help but be surprised and excited by the tremendous changes here. Looking down at the entire mining area from the hillside, it looks like a beautiful small city, with office buildings, hospitals, schools, clubs, trading companies, post and telecommunications bureaus, banks, and other buildings standing densely, with rows of white staff dormitories equipped with dining halls and bathhouses to the west. To the north is a huge oil refinery, with magnificent oil depots, towering oil derricks, and chimneys inside the refinery walls. Crude oil transported from the oil fields is refined here every day.
    The oil fields in the mining area are even more spectacular. Under the mountains, derricks stand tall, and drilling machines roar in the wilderness. Uyghur and Kazakh drilling workers operate the drilling machines on the platforms. Many oil wells that have already been drilled gush crude oil like fountains....
    The Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation was built with the full assistance of the Soviet Union. Shortly after the agreement was signed, Soviet experts began to arrive in batches at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains. At that time, they faced many difficulties: the original equipment was dilapidated, and many workers did not understand the technology. Almost everything had to start from scratch. However, the spirit of internationalism, which motivated them to assist their Chinese brothers in building the petroleum industry, inspired them to begin work with the amazing perseverance characteristic of Soviet people, under extremely difficult conditions. They often worked continuously for two or three days and nights, even bringing their meals to the machines. When building the oxygen plant, there were no skilled workers, so the oxygen plant director, A’wai’er, personally managed the machine operation while teaching the workers technology. Workers took turns resting, but he often stayed with the machine all day and night. Once, he had not slept for three days and nights, his eyes were bloodshot, but he still stood there staring at the machine, watching it run. A worker moved a stool for him to sit, but he said, "I can't sit down, I will fall asleep as soon as I sit down." It was through such tireless and amazing labor that the oxygen plant was finally built.
    In April 1952, when drilling workers were drilling an oil well near the oil layer, because the workers were not skilled enough, they did not close the gate in time, and gas spewed out violently from the bottom of the well, rushing more than 400 meters into the air. The derrick was showered with torrential rain-like mud and crude oil, and the gas made it difficult for workers to approach the wellhead. It looked like the well was about to collapse. Soviet expert Gorotov and all the Soviet engineers from the oilfield office rushed to the well upon hearing the news. Without even changing their clothes, they rushed to close the gate. When one became dizzy from the fumes, the other immediately took over. They continued like this from 8:00 in the morning until 12:00 at night before they finally closed the gate. By this time, everyone's face and body were covered in mud, as if they had crawled out of an oil mud pit.
    Helping Chinese brothers master technology is almost the sacred work creed of every Soviet staff member here. Most of the workers in the oil mine were Uyghur farmers from the countryside and Kazakh herdsmen from the grasslands. They had never seen such a large and complex modern factory, and they did not understand the Soviet language, so learning technology was very difficult. The experts patiently started by explaining the names and simple principles of the machines and tools. When mastering the machines, they stood by their side like an older brother leading a younger brother, doing and learning together. In February of last year, they also helped organize twenty professional amateur training courses lasting half a year to train a large number of skilled workers. Workers of all ethnic groups in our country studied diligently with great enthusiasm, overcoming the difficulties of lacking cultural and scientific knowledge and language barriers. In three years, more than 2,000 outstanding technicians and skilled workers have emerged from the Chinese staff of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation under the training of Soviet experts. The geology and drilling departments originally did not have a single technician or skilled worker. Last year, the geology department had more than 100 technicians who could operate exploration instruments such as magnetic surveys and electrical surveys, and the drilling department had more than 700 various skilled workers. In 1951, in the oilfield department, three workers could not independently manage one pumping unit. Now, one worker can independently manage four to five pumping units.
    Xinjiang, at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, is a famous and rich oil field in our country, which has not been well developed for many years. Now, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation has organized Chinese and Soviet experts and technicians and has begun extensive exploration. Over the past few years, exploration teams have been active in the Tarim Basin and Junggar Basin, north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. They carry tents and travel tirelessly in the mountains and wilderness, searching for oil seeps. Local ethnic cadres, farmers, and herdsmen enthusiastically helped them, guiding them and finding minerals for them. Some rushed to report mineral deposits to them. In this way, rich oil-bearing strata and oil seeps were finally discovered in many areas. Under the guidance and organization of Soviet experts, the geological exploration team of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation has continued to grow, and the number of field exploration teams has increased fivefold compared to 1951. Last year, the exploration area reached ten times that of 1951. Now, many exploratory wells have appeared within dozens of kilometers around the mining area. They are determined to build more oil wells at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains and extract the underground treasures of the motherland continuously.
    Over the past few years, new factories have sprung up in the Gobi Desert. Now there are modern general repair plants, power plants, oxygen plants, barite plants, oil refineries, and cracking plants. The cracking plant officially started production on May 22 last year. This is Xinjiang's first highly automated large-scale cracking plant. The machinery and equipment are all supplied by the Soviet Union, and many are the latest Soviet products. Liquid level, temperature, and pressure can be automatically controlled and recorded automatically. The instrument room has various instruments, and sitting there, you can clearly understand the production activities of the entire plant. There are special safety equipment and ventilation equipment to regulate the temperature everywhere, making workers feel comfortable and safe. Installing such complex machines was a huge task. The Soviet government sent many experts to participate in the installation and taught our country's employees technology in conjunction with the installation work. When the turbine and hot oil pump were installed, a group of technicians who could manage turbine operation were also trained.
    While building new factories, Soviet comrades still attached great importance to all existing machinery and equipment and never discarded them arbitrarily. Under their guidance, many oil wells that had not produced oil for many years were revived and produced oil again. There was originally a very old oil refinery here. Many of the production processes were manually operated and had not been used for a long time. Some people expressed disgust with this pile of legacy, but the Soviet chief engineer, Markriyan, insisted that it should be renovated rather than discarded. He said, "For equipment that can be used, under the current conditions, instead of discarding it, we should try to make it as good as new." Through the joint efforts of Chinese and Soviet staff, this simple oil refinery, which had been abandoned for many years, has been transformed into a new type of oil refinery after several renovations, and the amount of oil refined has increased thirtyfold. This matter has given the technical personnel of our country a great education.
    The recently published "Joint Communiqué on the Transfer of Soviet Shares in Various Joint-Stock Companies to the People's Republic of China" stated that when four Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies were established in 1950 and 1951, "At that time, the young People's Republic of China was facing the task of restoring the national economy. The establishment of the Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies, due to the use of the advanced experience of Soviet economic construction, made it possible to rectify the work of the enterprises under these companies, greatly expand their production capacity, and improve the general technical level in a short period of time. Therefore, the joint-stock companies have played a positive role and made certain contributions in the cause of restoring and developing the Chinese economy." The facts of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation over the past few years fully illustrate this point. The facts are indeed like this: With the fraternal help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts, the petroleum company has survived the difficult period, gradually developed and grown, greatly expanded its production capacity in a short period of time, and improved its technical level. Production of drilling, oil extraction, and oil refining is developing at an amazing speed. According to statistics in 1953, drilling production increased more than four times compared to 1951, crude oil production increased more than nineteen times compared to 1951, and various work systems of the enterprise have also been established. The achievements of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Corporation have played a positive role in restoring and developing my country's economic undertakings.
    Over the past few years, Soviet friends have built the jointly operated petroleum company with selfless hard work, cultivated talents, and taught us experience. Now they have decided to completely transfer Soviet shares to our country from January 1 next year. The Chinese people will never forget this profound spirit of internationalism. All the staff of the petroleum company will work harder to build the oil base in the border area of the motherland and develop the fuel industry of New China to thank them. (Attached photo)

    天山脚下的中苏友谊
    ——记新疆中苏石油股份公司
    宗边
    一九五○年三月二十七日，我国和苏联在莫斯科签订了创办两个联合的中苏股份公司的协定。一个是石油公司，一个是有色及稀有金属公司。协定签订后不久，中苏石油股份公司便成立了。
    中苏石油股份公司在新疆天山脚下的戈壁滩上。这几年来，这里已成了一座热闹而美丽的石油矿区，人们来到这里，都不禁为这里的巨大变化感到惊讶和振奋。从山坡上远眺矿区的全境，简直就像是一座美丽的小城市，办公大楼、医院、学校、俱乐部、贸易公司、邮电局和银行等各式建筑，密集地屹立着，西边又是一排排白色的，有着饭厅和澡塘等设备的职工宿舍。这里的北面是一座巨大的炼油厂，炼油厂围墙里竖立着雄伟的油库，高耸的油塔和烟囱。这里整日制炼着从油田上运来的原油。
    矿区的油田更是壮观。在山峰下一座座的井架高耸着，钻探机在山野里轰鸣不息。维吾尔族和哈萨克族的钻井工人们在井台上操纵着钻探机在钻进。已经钻成的许多油井，原油像喷泉似地喷射出来……。
    中苏石油股份公司是在苏联的全面援助下建设起来的。协定签订后不久，苏联专家们便开始一批批来到了这天山脚下。当时摆在他们面前的困难是极多的：原有设备破烂不堪，许多工人不懂技术。一切几乎都要从头做起。但是协助中国兄弟建设石油工业的国际主义情谊激励着他们，终于在万分困难的条件下，以苏维埃人特有的惊人毅力开始了工作。他们经常一连两三个昼夜不休息，连饭都搬到机器边上去吃。建立氧气厂时没有一个技术工人，于是氧气厂厂长阿外尔一面亲自管理机器操作，一面教工人学习技术。工人轮班休息，而他常常整天通宵不离开机器。有一回，他已经三昼夜没有睡觉了，眼睛熬得通红，但他仍然站在那里盯着机器运转，有
  一个工人搬了张凳子让他坐，他说：“不能坐，一坐就会睡着了。”就在这样不眠不休的惊人劳动下，氧气厂终于建成了。
    一九五二年四月间，钻井工人们在钻一口油井时钻到油层附近，因为工人技术不熟练，没有来得及关住闸门，瓦斯从井底猛烈地喷射出来，直冲到四百公尺以上的半空里，井架跟前洒着暴雨般的泥水和原油，瓦斯熏得工人难以接近井口，眼看这口井就要被冲垮了。苏联专家果洛脱夫和油田处所有的苏联工程师闻讯后全跑到井上来，连衣服也没换，就赶去关闸门，这个被熏昏了，那个便立即接上去，这样从早上八点一直到晚上十二点才关住闸门，这时每个人的脸上身上全是污泥浆，像是从油泥坑里爬出来的一样。
    帮助中国弟兄掌握技术，几乎是这里每一个苏联工作人员神圣的工作信条。油矿上的工人大多数是从农村里来的维吾尔族农民和从草原上来的哈萨克族牧民，他们从没见过这样庞大复杂的近代工厂，又不懂苏联语言，学习技术是很费劲的，专家们就耐心地从讲解机器、工具的名称和简单的原理开始。在掌握机器时，就像哥哥领着弟弟走路一样，站在身边不离开，做一样，学一样。去年二月，他们又帮助举办了为期半年的二十个专业业余训练班，大量训练技术工人。我国各族工人都以很大的热情努力学习，克服缺乏文化科学知识和语言不通的困难。三年中，中苏石油股份公司的我国职工在苏联专家培养下，已涌现出二千多个优秀的技术人员和技术工人。地质、钻井两处原来没有一个技术人员和技术工人，去年地质处已有一百多个能操纵磁测、电测等勘探仪器的技术人员，钻井处的各种技术工人已有七百多人。油田处在一九五一年时，三个工人管理一台抽油泵还不能独立工作，而现在一个工人已可以单独管理四台到五台抽油泵了。
    新疆天山脚下是我国著名丰富的油田，过去多少年来没有得到很好的开发，现在，中苏石油股份公司组织了中苏专家和技术人员，已开始了广泛的勘探。勘探队几年来活跃在天山南北的塔里木盆地和准噶尔盆地，他们带着帐篷，终年不辞辛劳的在山野间和戈壁滩上奔走，寻找油苗。当地的民族干部、农民和牧民都热情地帮助他们，为他们带路找矿，有的赶去向他们报矿，这样终于在很多地区发现了蕴藏丰富的石油地层和油苗。在苏联专家的指导和组织下，中苏石油股份公司的地质勘探队伍不断地壮大起来了，野外勘探队已比一九五一年增加五倍。去年勘探面积已达一九五一年的十倍。现在，在矿区周围的几十公里以内，已经出现了很多探井，他们决心要在天山脚下建设起更多的油井，把祖国的地下宝藏源源地汲取出来。
    几年来，一座座新的工厂在戈壁滩上矗立了起来。现在这里已有了近代化设备的总修理厂、发电厂、氧气厂、重晶石厂、炼油厂和裂化厂。裂化厂于去年五月二十二日正式开工投入生产。这是新疆第一座高度自动化的大型裂化工厂，机器设备都是由苏联供应的，许多都是苏联的最新出品，液面、温度、压力都能自动控制，还能自动记录。仪器房有各种各样的仪表，坐在那里就可以清楚地了解全厂生产的活动情况。各处都有特殊的安全设备和调节冷热的通风设备，使劳动者感到舒适与安全。安装这种复杂的机器是一件巨大的工作，苏联政府又派了很多专家来参加安装，并结合安装工作教我国职工学习技术。当透平和热油泵安装完毕时，也就培养成了一批能够管理透平操作的技工。
    在建设新厂的同时，苏联同志依然十分重视一切旧有的机器设备，决不随意废弃。在他们的指导下，许多已经好多年不出油的油井，重新复活出油了。这里原来有一座很老旧的炼油厂，生产过程许多是人工操作的，已很久未使用了，有的人对这堆遗产表示了厌弃的态度，但是苏联的总工程师马尔克里扬一直坚持认为应当把它革新，而不是弃掉，他说：“我们对能利用的设备，在目前的条件下，不是把它弃掉，而是要想办法把它变成和新的一样好使。”在中苏工作人员的共同努力下，这座已被废置多年的简陋的炼油厂，先后经过几次改造，现在已成了一座新型的炼油厂，炼油量提高了三十倍。这件事给了我国技术人员极大的教育。
    最近公布的“中苏关于将各股份公司中的苏联股份移交给中华人民共和国的联合公报”中曾说到：一九五○年和一九五一年成立四个中苏股份公司时，“当时是年青的中华人民共和国面临着恢复国民经济任务的时期。各中苏股份公司的建立，由于利用苏联经济建设的先进经验，在短期内为整顿这些公司所属各企业的工作、为大大扩大它们的生产能力和为提高一般技术水平提供了可能性。因此，各股份公司在恢复和发展中国经济的事业中，已起了积极的作用，并作出了一定的贡献。”中苏石油股份公司几年来的事实，最充分地说明了这一点。事实正是这样：在苏联政府和苏联专家的兄弟般的帮助之下，石油公司渡过了艰难困苦的时期，逐步发展壮大起来，在短时期内大大地扩大了生产能力，提高了技术水平，钻井、采油和炼油等生产以惊人的速度在发展着，根据一九五三年的统计，钻井生产比一九五一年增加了四倍以上，原油产量比一九五一年增加了十九倍以上，企业各项工作制度也都建立起来了。中苏石油股份公司的这些成就，在恢复和发展我国的经济事业中起了积极的作用。
    苏联朋友们几年来以忘我的辛勤劳动，把共同经营的石油公司建设起来了，人才培养出来了，经验教给我们了。现在他们决定从明年一月一日起，将苏联股份完全移交给我国。这种深厚的国际主义的情谊，中国人民是永远不会忘记的。石油公司的全体工作人员，将以更努力地建设祖国边疆的石油基地，发展新中国的燃料工业，来感念他们。（附图片）
