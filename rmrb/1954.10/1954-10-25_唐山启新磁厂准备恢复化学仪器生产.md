    Tangshan Qixin Magnetic Factory Prepares to Resume Chemical Instrument Production
    A letter from the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on July 31st published a reader's suggestion to the Tangshan Qixin Magnetic Factory to resume chemical instrument production. This suggestion is correct. Since receiving our bureau's notice to resume chemical instrument production, the factory has begun preparations. Because chemical instrument production had been suspended for some time, to ensure product quality upon official production, trial production was first started, and samples were sent to testing departments to test the physical and chemical properties of the products. In addition, under the specific organization of our bureau's transportation and sales department, the factory's sales personnel in Shanghai and Beijing were instructed to contact relevant departments to discuss product consignment and product specifications and quantities. The above two tasks are currently underway.
    Recently, based on the consignment negotiations with relevant departments and the required specifications and quantities, our bureau formally notified the Tangshan Qixin Magnetic Factory to resume the production of chemical instruments. The notice instructed the factory to continue contacting commercial departments regarding consignment issues to enable planned production. Before consignment is finalized, production can be carried out according to the following principles: First, specifications should be simplified as much as possible based on objective needs. Second, strict attention should be paid to ensuring and improving quality. Third, in addition to orders from using units, general specification varieties that are used more frequently and consumed more should be selected for production, and active promotion and supply should be made to using units and commercial departments that are currently negotiating consignment, to create conditions for consignment.
    Because the small kiln bottom used by the factory to produce chemical instruments is undergoing major repairs, it is expected to resume production in October.

### 唐山启新磁厂准备恢复化学仪器生产

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    唐山启新磁厂准备恢复化学仪器生产
    重工业部建筑材料工业管理局来信：七月三十一日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者建议唐山启新磁厂恢复化学仪器生产的来信。这个建议是正确的。该厂自接到我局关于恢复化学仪器生产的通知后，就开始进行准备工作。因为化学仪器已经停产了一个时期，为了保证正式生产时的产品质量，首先开始了试制工作，并送请试验部门试验产品的物理性能和化学性能。此外，在我局运销处的具体组织下，责成该厂上海、北京的销售人员与有关部门接洽产品包销和产品的品种规格数量等问题。以上两项工作现正在继续进行中。
    最近我局根据与有关部门接洽包销及所需品种规格数量的情况，又正式通知唐山启新磁厂恢复化学仪器的生产。通知中责成该厂继续与商业部门接洽包销问题，以便有计划地生产。在未办妥包销前，可根据以下原则进行生产：一，按照客观需要情况尽量简化规格。二，严格注意保证质量与提高质量。三，除用货单位之订货外，应选择分析化验使用较多、消耗较大、比较一般性的规格品种来生产，主动地向使用单位推销和供给正在接洽包销的商业部门推销，为包销创造条件。
    因为该厂生产化学仪器的小窑窑底进行大修，预计十月份可恢复生产。
