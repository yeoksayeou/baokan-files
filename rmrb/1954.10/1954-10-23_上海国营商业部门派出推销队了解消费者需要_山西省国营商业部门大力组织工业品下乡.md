    Shanghai State-Owned Commercial Departments Send Sales Teams to Understand Consumer Needs
    Shanxi Province State-Owned Commercial Departments Vigorously Organize Industrial Products Going to the Countryside
    As the peak trading season after autumn harvest approaches, many state-owned commercial departments in Shanghai have dispatched visiting sales teams to various cities, rural areas, and industrial and mining areas to understand consumer needs and market conditions. Twenty-nine visiting sales teams organized by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Stations of the China General Merchandise and Pharmaceutical Companies, and the Shanghai Branch of the China Hardware and Machinery Company, departed successively before October 20th.
    The visiting sales teams organized by the state-owned commercial departments this time will visit areas as far as Yunnan, Heilongjiang, and Gansu provinces. They are carrying samples of industrial products, brochures, and some promotional materials managed by their respective companies, and some even carry samples, in order to introduce to local state-owned stores and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives goods suitable for rural needs. They also plan to cooperate with local state-owned commercial departments to hold forums for salespersons and consumers, hold small commodity exhibitions, visit workers' families, agricultural production cooperatives, and handicraft workshops, etc., to understand the actual sales of Shanghai products in the local area, and listen to urban and rural people's opinions on the variety, specifications, quality, and supply work of the products.
    Prior to this, the purchasing and supply departments of Shanghai's state-owned commerce had organized visiting teams to visit various places. The opinions they collected in the countryside provided a good basis for improving supply work and guiding factories to improve product quality. (Xinhua News Agency) Shanxi Province State-owned commercial departments are vigorously organizing industrial products to go to the countryside to meet the needs of farmers for daily necessities after selling grain and cotton and other agricultural products. In the fourth quarter of this year, the total value of commodities to be supplied by state-owned commercial departments in Shanxi Province exceeds that of the same period last year by more than 87 percent. A large number of commodities have now been transferred to rural areas throughout the province. The transportation of fabrics, salt, coal, and cigarettes, etc., planned for supply in the fourth quarter was overfulfilled in September, and by mid-October, nearly half of the daily necessities planned for supply to the countryside in the fourth quarter had been transported to all parts of the province.
    In the first half of September, as soon as the rainy season was over, state-owned commercial departments in Shanxi Province began a concentrated effort to transfer goods and adopted various methods to quickly supply consumers with various commodities. The Yuci County State-owned Department Store Center convened a supply meeting for the department stores in key counties within its supply range and rationally distributed commodities according to the needs of the people. The Wanrong County Department Store exhibited more than 1,300 kinds of commodities, invited representatives of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups to visit, and the transaction volume within two days reached more than 240 million yuan. They also formed three mobile exhibition and sales groups with the local supply and marketing cooperatives, and in seven days, they sold more than 20 million yuan worth of industrial products in more than ten villages, and purchased a large amount of cotton and grain.
    In order to further invigorate the urban and rural material exchange during the peak trading season after the autumn harvest, state-owned commercial departments in Shanxi Province have recently transferred cadres on October 20 to go to various parts of the province to cooperate with the staff of state-owned commercial units and supply and marketing cooperatives to supply a large number of industrial products to the vast number of farmers.

    在秋后市场贸易旺季到来的时候，上海市许多国营商业部门派出访问推销队，分别前往各城市、农村和工矿区了解消费者的需要和市场情况。中国百货、医药等公司的上海采购供应站和中国五金机械公司上海分公司组织的二十九个访问推销队，已在十月二十日前先后出发。
    各国营商业部门这次组织的访问推销队，访问地区最远将到云南、黑龙江、甘肃等省。他们携带着各自所属公司经营的工业品样本、说明书和一些宣传材料，有的还带着样品，以便向各地的国营商店、基层供销合作社介绍适合农村需要的商品。并准备配合当地国营商业部门召开营业员、消费者座谈会，举行小型商品展览会，访问工人家庭，农业生产合作社和手工业作坊等，了解上海产品在当地的实际销售情况，听取城乡人民对产品的品种、规格、质量和供应工作等方面的意见。
    在此以前，上海市国营商业的采购供应部门曾经组织过访问队到各地访问。他们下乡收集的意见，对改进供应工作、指导工厂提高产品质量提供了良好的依据。　（新华社）山西省国营商业部门大力组织工业品下乡，以满足农民在出售粮食和棉花等农产品后对日用品的需要。今年第四季度山西省各国营商业部门准备供应的商品的总值超过去年同期百分之八十七以上。现在大批商品已源源调往省内各地农村。计划在九月份调运的供第四季度销售的布匹、食盐、煤和纸烟等都超额完成，第四季度计划供应农村的日用百货，到十月中旬约有近半数运到了全省各地。
    九月上半月雨季刚过，山西省各国营商业部门就开始了突击调运，并采取各种办法，迅速供应消费者各种百货。榆次县国营百货中心商店召集他们供应范围内的各重点县百货商店开了供应会议，根据人民需要合理分配了商品。万荣县百货商店展览一千三百多种商品，邀请农业生产合作社、互助组的代表参观，两天内的成交额达二亿四千多万元。他们还和当地供销合作社组成三个流动展览推销组，七天内在十多个村子推销了价值二千多万元的工业品，并收购了大量的棉花和粮食。
    为了进一步活跃秋后贸易旺季的城乡物资交流，山西省各国营商业部门最近抽调干部在十月二十日分别前往省内各地协同国营商业单位和供销合作社的工作人员，把大批工业品供应给广大农民。
