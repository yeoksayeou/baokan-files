    Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ayyangar said that the trade negotiations between the delegations of the Chinese and Indian governments this time have consistently been marked by great sincerity and very friendly wishes, hoping to understand and appreciate each other's problems and difficulties. He said that this agreement is an economic manifestation of the friendship that has always existed between our two countries. The Indian government warmly hopes that this agreement will not only help develop trade relations between our two countries, but will also help strengthen our friendly ties. He said, "I have no doubt that this agreement will lay a solid foundation on which it can be continuously extended in light of considerations of evolving situations."

The agreement signed on April 29th this year between the two countries on trade and transportation between the Tibet region of China and India has provided a new basis for strengthening and developing the relations between our two countries. On this new basis, the Chinese and Indian governments, in the spirit of mutual assistance and exchange of needed goods, and in accordance with the needs and possibilities of both sides, have signed this first trade agreement, and have exchanged two notes on the issues of the implementation of this agreement by the two governments, which will undoubtedly help greatly develop the economic and trade relations between our two countries. The development of trade will in turn certainly promote common understanding and strengthen the friendship between our two countries, as well as peace in Asia and the world.
