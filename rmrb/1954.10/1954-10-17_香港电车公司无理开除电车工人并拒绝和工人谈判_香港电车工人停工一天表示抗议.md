Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th: The Hong Kong Tramways Company's unjustified dismissal of 31 tram workers and persistent refusal to negotiate with the workers has further aggravated the labor dispute.

Since July 1st, when the Hong Kong Tramways Company dismissed 31 tram workers under the pretext of "surplus manpower," the Hong Kong tram workers, in order to protect their jobs and take care of social transportation, have been demanding that the management and workers resolve the labor dispute through negotiations, and have requested the Hong Kong British Government Labour Department to be responsible for mediation. As of October 10th, Hong Kong tram workers had met with Mr. Johnston, the manager of the tram company, six times, and visited the Hong Kong British Government Labour Department as many as 21 times. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions has also repeatedly issued statements, proposing various reasonable suggestions, demanding that the tram company management and workers quickly resolve this labor dispute through negotiations. However, Mr. Johnston, the manager of the Hong Kong Tramways Company, has consistently refused to negotiate, and has even continued to dismiss tram worker Liang Naiqiang and force worker Zhang Wenda to stop working, increasing the severity of the dispute. The Hong Kong British Government Labour Department has also repeatedly used "non-intervention" as an excuse not to mediate this dispute, which has been dragging on for more than 100 days without a resolution.

The attitude of a small number of elements in the Hong Kong Tramways Company management in refusing to negotiate and deliberately expanding the dispute, and the Hong Kong British Government Labour Department's expression of irresponsibility in mediation, have aroused immense indignation among all tram workers, who had no choice but to hold a two-hour strike protest on August 31st. Because this still did not yield results, they were forced to strike again for one day on October 10th, in order to strive for immediate negotiations and a reasonable resolution to the dispute. Workers from the Hong Kong China Bus Company also held a fifteen-minute strike on the morning of the 10th to support the tram workers' reasonable demands. The Hong Kong Tram Workers' Union issued a statement on October 11th, saying: The purpose of this strike protest is to demonstrate the determination of the tram workers to strive for a reasonable resolution to this dispute, in order to urge the management to immediately negotiate with the workers. The statement pointed out: "Today, the dispute has been further aggravated, and has caused even more of a threat to social transportation and the lives of citizens. The management, Mr. Johnston, should see the facts clearly, immediately negotiate with the workers, and the Labour Department must also take responsibility and earnestly mediate the dispute. Otherwise, if Mr. Johnston allows the incident to continue to expand, he will be responsible for all the consequences, and the Hong Kong British Government Labour Department cannot shirk its responsibility."

Workers from all industries and people from all walks of life in Hong Kong sympathize with and support the tram workers' reasonable demands. The "Support Committee for Tram Workers to Protect Their Jobs and Livelihoods," organized by trade unions in Hong Kong's bus, electricity, telephone, power, gas, and dockyard industries, and other industries, has launched food storage and savings campaigns, and a signature drive. To date, the Hong Kong Tram Workers' Union has received nearly 100,000 Hong Kong dollars in consolation money from workers in various industries, and more than 100,000 people have signed in support of the tram workers.

    香港电车公司无理开除电车工人并拒绝和工人谈判
    香港电车工人停工一天表示抗议
    【新华社广州十三日电】香港电车公司无理开除三十一名电车工人并坚持拒绝和工人谈判，使这项劳资纠纷进一步严重化。
    自从七月一日香港电车公司借口“人力过剩”开除三十一名电车工人以来，香港电车工人为了保障职业和照顾社会交通，一直要求资方和工人通过谈判解决这项劳资纠纷，并要求香港英国政府劳工处负责调处。截至十月十日止，香港电车工人曾六次去见电车公司经理庄士顿，并往访香港英国政府劳工处达二十一次之多。港九工会联合会也一再发表声明，提出各种合理的建议，要求电车公司资方和工人通过谈判来迅速解决这次劳资纠纷。但是，香港电车公司经理庄士顿一直拒绝协商，而且还继续开除电车工人梁乃强和迫令工人张文达停工，增加了纠纷的严重性。香港英国政府劳工处对这项纠纷也屡次以“不干预”为借口不加调处，这样就使纠纷拖延一百多天一直未得到解决。
    香港电车公司资方少数分子这种拒绝谈判、蓄意扩大纠纷的态度和香港英国政府的劳工处不负责调处的表示，引起全体电车工人的无比愤慨，并不得不在八月三十一日举行两小时的停工抗议，由于仍未获得结果，又被迫在十月十日停工一天，以争取立即谈判，使纠纷得到合理解决。香港中华巴士公司工人也在十日上午举行了十五分钟的停工来支持电车工人的合理要求。香港电车职工会十月十一日发表声明说：这次停工抗议的目的是为了表明电车工人争取这次纠纷合理解决的决心，以促使资方立即和工人谈判。声明指出：“今天纠纷已进一步严重化，已更加引起对社会交通和市民生活的威胁，资方庄士顿应该看清楚事实，立即与工人谈判，劳工处也要负起责任，切实进行调处纠纷，否则让资方庄士顿任令事件继续扩大，其一切后果应由资方庄士顿负责，香港英国政府劳工处也不能推卸责任。”
    香港各业工人和社会人士都同情和支持电车工人的合理要求。香港的巴士、电灯、电话、电力、煤气和船坞及其他各行业工会所组织的“支援电车工友保障职业生活委员会”，都发动储粮储款和签名运动。到目前为止，香港电车职工会收到各业工人的慰问金已近港币十万元，签名支持电车工人的有十万人以上。新华社更正
