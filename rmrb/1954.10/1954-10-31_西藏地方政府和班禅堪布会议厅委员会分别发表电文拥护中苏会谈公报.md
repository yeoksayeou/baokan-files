Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th -- The local government of Tibet and the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee issued telegrams supporting the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué.

    The telegram from the local government of Tibet stated: After hearing the news of the release of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué, we felt infinite excitement and joy. In addition to expressing our warm support for the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué, we also sincerely thank the Soviet government and people for their selfless assistance to our country. This meeting demonstrated the common desire of the Chinese and Soviet people to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, and to further develop the brotherly friendship between the two peoples. At the same time, it marked another great victory for the world peace and democracy camp in safeguarding world peace, and gave a powerful blow to the imperialist aggressors who attempted to launch a war. This meeting also demonstrated the Soviet Union's sincere assistance to the Chinese people in carrying out peaceful construction, which will further accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country. We believe that the communiqué and joint declaration issued at this meeting are fully in line with the common aspirations and common interests of the Chinese and Soviet people. In the future, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, we will strengthen the unity with all fraternal nationalities of the motherland, learn from their construction experience, and unite with the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to jointly build a new Tibet, consolidate the southwest national defense of the motherland, and enable our motherland to complete the construction of socialist industrialization at an early date.

    The telegram from the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee wrote: We are delighted to hear that the Soviet government delegation held talks with our government during their visit to our country, reached various agreements, and issued a joint declaration. The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is of great significance for maintaining world peace and building our great socialist country, and at the same time, it will bring greater happiness and brightness to the Tibetan people. As mentioned in the speech of the Panchen Erdeni Master, the great achievements made in all aspects of China and the happy and warm life that the Tibetan people enjoy today in the big family of the motherland are inseparable from the selfless help given to us by the Soviet Union. All the monks, lay officials, and people of our Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee express our unparalleled excitement and heartfelt gratitude, and warmly support this historically significant meeting and the various agreements reached.
