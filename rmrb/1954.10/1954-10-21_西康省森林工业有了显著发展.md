    Significant Development in Forest Industry of Xikang Province

    The forest industry of Xikang Province has greatly developed. It is estimated that the province's timber production this year will increase thirty-three times compared to 1950, and the felling area will also increase from 5.6 hectares in 1950 to more than 2,500 hectares this year. Baoxing Logging Site only developed one forest area in 1950, and this year it has increased to six forest areas. The number of forestry workers in the province has also increased seventy times compared to 1950.

    Xikang Province is one of China's major forest areas. Dense virgin forests grow in the Qingyi River, Dadu River, Yalong River, and Kangzang Plateau areas. These trees are mostly high-quality spruce, fir, and hemlock with over 500 annual rings. In order to develop these virgin forests, the state established logging sites in Baoxing, Tianquan, and Yingjing in 1950, and also set up timber purchasing stations in Ya'an, Lushan, and other places. These logging sites are newly built. Through the efforts of the workers and continuous improvement of technology, the backward situation has been greatly changed. Baoxing and Tianquan Logging Sites have built more than 28,000 meters of wooden railway and more than 8,200 meters of wooden slides. Baoxing Logging Site has also built 7,800 meters of narrow-gauge railway, which greatly improved production efficiency.

    With the development of production, the lives of forestry workers have also greatly improved. Denglonggou and Jianchang, where Baoxing and Tianquan Logging Sites are located, have now become prosperous markets. There are post offices, supply and marketing cooperatives, libraries, and clinics dedicated to serving forestry workers.

    西康省森林工业有了显著发展
    西康省森林工业有了很大发展，预计今年全省木材生产比一九五○年增加三十三倍，采伐面积也由一九五○年的五点六公顷增加到今年二千五百多公顷。宝兴伐木场在一九五○年只开伐一个林区，今年增加到六个林区。全省林业工人也比一九五○年增加了七十倍。
    西康省是我国主要林区之一，在青衣江、大渡河、雅砻江和康藏高原一带，都生长着茂密的原始森林，这些林木大多是木质优良年轮在五百年以上的云杉、冷杉和铁杉等。为了开发这些原始森林，一九五○年国家在宝兴、天全、荥经等地建立了伐木场，又在雅安、芦山等地设立了木材收购站。这些伐木场都是新建的，经过职工的努力钻研不断改进技术，落后的状况已得到了很大的改变。宝兴和天全伐木场已修了二万八千多公尺长的木轨道和八千二百多公尺木滑道，宝兴木场还修了七千八百公尺的轻便铁道，大大提高了生产效率。
    随着生产的发展，林业工人的生活也有了很大改善。宝兴和天全伐木场的所在地灯笼沟和艰厂现在已变成了繁荣的市场，在这里设有专为林业工人服务的邮局、供销合作社、图书室和医疗所。
