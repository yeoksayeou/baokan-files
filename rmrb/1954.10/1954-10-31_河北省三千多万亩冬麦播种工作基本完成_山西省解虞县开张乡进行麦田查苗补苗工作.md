Hebei Province Basically Completes Sowing of Over 30 Million Mu of Winter Wheat
Kaizhang Township, Xieyu County, Shanxi Province, Conducts Wheat Field Seedling Inspection and Replanting

Hebei Province has basically completed the sowing of winter wheat. As of October 22nd, the province had sown over 30.27 million mu of wheat, accounting for 95.7 percent of the winter wheat sowing plan. Currently, farmers in various regions are combining autumn plowing with wheat field seedling inspection and replanting, striving for increased wheat production next year.

This year, rainfall in various parts of Hebei Province has been heavy. Farmers in various counties in the southern cotton-producing areas, due to the wet land and good soil moisture, wanted to blindly expand wheat fields. In the flood-stricken areas, some farmers believed that harvesting wheat would not be possible until next year, and that it would be better to engage in sideline production for immediate gains, so their enthusiasm for planting wheat was not high. In response to the above situation, Party committees at all levels in the cotton-producing areas and flood-stricken areas dispatched a large number of cadres to publicize to the farmers the importance of planting according to the national plan to support national economic construction, and improved the political and ideological awareness of the farmers, and revised the planting plan. Farmers in Zhujiazhuang, Luancheng County, cotton-producing region, originally planned to plant 490 mu of wheat. After propaganda and education by the general Party branch of the township, the farmers' thinking was straightened out, and the entire village reduced the wheat planting plan to 286 mu. After various counties in the Tianjin Special District explained to the farmers that planting more wheat was beneficial to the country and to themselves, many farmers drained water and planted wheat day and night. Farmers in seven townships, including Lijiazhuang in Jinghai County, used more than 600 waterwheels and more than 100 water dragons, non-stop day and night, to pump water and planted more than 9,000 mu of wheat.

In the wheat planting work, mutual aid and cooperative organizations once again demonstrated their superiority. Many agricultural production cooperatives modelly sowed wheat in accordance with the national planting plan, and led farmers to plant in accordance with the national plan. Donggang Township, Linzhang County, is suitable for planting cotton. The Liu Ming Agricultural Production Cooperative in the township originally planned to plant 55 mu of wheat, but later reduced it to 30 mu according to the national plan. Under the leadership of the cooperative, farmers in the township actively revised the wheat planting plan, planting less wheat and reserving more cotton fields. Farmers in the flood-stricken areas, having personally seen that the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams were planting wheat quickly and well, also actively organized themselves and increased the speed of wheat sowing. Jinghai, Dacheng, Wen'an, Wuqing and other counties in the Tianjin Special District restored and developed 869 mutual aid teams; most of the 941 agricultural production cooperatives that had been built in the entire special district were built while planting wheat, completing the wheat planting plan on time.

This year, the weather is cold and humid, and in some places, after wheat planting, the wheat seedlings did not emerge evenly. Now, Party committees and people's governments at all levels are combining the development of the autumn plowing movement to lead farmers to inspect and replant seedlings in order to strive for increased wheat production next year.

The Dongkaizhang and Puleitou agricultural production cooperatives in Kaizhang Township, Xieyu County, Shanxi Province, actively carried out wheat field seedling inspection and replanting work, laying the foundation for increased wheat production next year. After these two cooperatives finished planting wheat, the members believed that the rainfall this year was sufficient, the sowing was timely, and it was also dense planting, so they did not pay much attention to the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges in the wheat fields. After the Party branch of the township discovered this problem, it organized cooperative cadres to go to the fields for inspection. During the inspection, it was found that the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges was very common, and some wheat fields were missing seedlings by as much as one-tenth. Only then did the cooperative cadres and members realize the importance of seedling inspection and replanting. Therefore, on October 9th, the two cooperatives organized a seedling inspection and replanting team of 46 people to inspect and replant field by field and ridge by ridge. The wheat fields of the two cooperatives were missing seedlings by as much as 95 mu. As of October 11th, 67 mu had been replanted, and the masses in the whole township were driven to carry out seedling inspection and replanting. Farmers in Puleitou Village in the township replanted 60 mu in three days. (Wang Qi, Zhang Yi)

    河北省三千多万亩冬麦播种工作基本完成
    山西省解虞县开张乡进行麦田查苗补苗工作
      河北省的冬小麦播种工作已基本完成。到十月二十二日，全省已播种小麦三千零二十七万多亩，占冬小麦播种计划的百分之九十五点七。现在各地农民正结合秋耕进行麦田查苗补苗，争取明年小麦增产。
    今年河北省各地雨量很大，南部产棉区各县的农民，因地湿墒土好，想盲目扩大麦田。水灾区则有些农民以为种麦子到明年才能收割，不如搞副业生产现得利，种麦情绪不高。根据上述情况，产棉区和水灾区的各级党委，曾派出大批干部，向农民宣传了按照国家计划种植对于支持国家经济建设的重要意义，提高了农民的政治思想觉悟，修改了种植计划。产棉区栾城县朱家庄的农民，本来打算种四百九十亩麦子，经过该乡中共总支部的宣传教育，打通了农民的思想，全村把种麦计划缩小到二百八十六亩。天津专区各县向农民讲解了多种小麦对国家、对自己都有利的道理以后，很多农民不分昼夜地排水种麦。静海县李家庄等七个乡的农民，用六百多个水斗子、一百多条水龙，日夜不停地掏水，种了九千多亩麦子。
    在种麦工作中，各地互助合作组织，再一次显示了它的优越性。许多农业生产合作社模范地按照国家种植计划播种小麦，并带动农民按照国家计划种植。临漳县东岗乡适合种棉，该乡刘明农业生产合作社原计划种五十五亩小麦，后按国家计划缩减成三十亩。在该社的带动下，全乡农民纷纷修订种麦计划，少种小麦，多留棉田。水灾区的农民，亲眼看到农业生产合作社和互助组的小麦种的快，种的好，也都纷纷组织起来，提高了小麦播种的速度。天津专区的静海、大城、文安、武清等县，就恢复和发展了八百六十九个互助组；全专区已经建成的九百四十一个农业生产合作社，大部是边建社，边种麦，按时完成了种麦计划。
    今年天寒地湿，有些地方的小麦种植后，麦苗出的不齐。现在各地党委和人民政府正结合开展秋耕运动，领导农民查苗补苗，以争取明年小麦增产。

    山西省解虞县开张乡东开张、普乐头两农业生产合作社，积极进行麦田查苗补苗工作，给明年小麦增产打下基础。这两个社种完小麦后，社员们认为今年雨水充足，播种适时，而且又是密植，对麦田里缺苗断垅的现象便不大注意。该乡党支部发现这个问题后，就组织社干部下田检查。在检查中发现缺苗断垅的现象很普遍，有些麦田缺苗达十分之
  一。这样才使社干部和社员们认识到查苗补苗的重要，于是这两社在十月九日组织了四十六个人的查苗补苗小组，逐亩逐垅检查补种。两社麦田缺苗达九十五亩，到十月十一日止已补了六十七亩，并且带动全乡群众开展了查苗补苗。该乡普乐头村农民三天内就补种了六十亩。　（王琦、张一）
