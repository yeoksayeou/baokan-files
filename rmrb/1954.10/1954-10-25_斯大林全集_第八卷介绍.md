Introduction to Volume VIII of "The Complete Works of Stalin"
Chen Shan

Volume VIII of "The Complete Works of Stalin" includes Stalin's writings from January to November 1926. 1926 was an extremely important milestone in the history of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet Union, the first year in which the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, launched a tense struggle to realize the general policy of national socialist industrialization.

At that time, the domestic and international situation was: the capitalist world was showing temporary, superficial, and partial stability. However, this stability did not ease the inherent irreconcilable contradictions of capitalism; on the contrary, the contradictions and crises of capitalism were growing. International imperialists believed that the consolidation and development of the Soviet Union directly threatened their own existence, so they tried every means to hinder the realization of socialist industrialization and sabotage the construction work of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the struggle between capitalist and socialist elements in the Soviet national economy became increasingly complicated. The activities of the Trotsky-Zinoviev anti-Party alliance, the restorers of capitalism, reflected this situation. They maliciously distorted Leninism, frantically carried out anti-Party split activities, openly opposed the plan of socialist industrialization, and attempted to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union and make it a subject of imperialist enslavement.

In order to overcome the various difficulties faced and ensure the realization of the general line of national socialist industrialization formulated by the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Party must educate the entire Party and the people of the country, so that they fully understand the current domestic and international situation and strengthen their belief in the inevitable victory of socialist construction; it must expose the capitulationist essence of the opposition alliance, thoroughly crush the opposition ideologically and organizationally, and unite the entire Party closely around the Party Central Committee.

The writings included in Volume VIII of "The Complete Works of Stalin" are of decisive significance to the struggle of the Soviet people for socialist industrialization. In these works, Stalin pointed out the direction of further development of the revolution and the future of socialist construction, exposed the opposition's attempt to falsify Marxism-Leninism, struck at the enemies of Leninism, and defended and developed Lenin's great doctrine.

The article "On Some Questions of Leninism" occupies a major position in Volume VIII. It is a continuation and development of the historical work "On the Foundations of Leninism" written by the author in 1924. In "On Some Questions of Leninism," Stalin discusses several of the most important topics in Marxism-Leninism: the international significance of Leninism as a higher stage of the development of Marxism, the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the role of the Soviets, the role of the Party in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the relationship between the Party and the Soviets, the worker-peasant alliance as the basis of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the foundations of Party building and organization.

Stalin gave a classic definition of Leninism in "On the Foundations of Leninism": "Leninism is Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. More precisely, Leninism is the theory and tactics of proletarian revolution in general, and the theory and tactics of the dictatorship of the proletariat in particular." (Page 13) However, the Zinoviev faction attempted to obliterate the great significance of Leninism, saying that Leninism was a product of Russia's special circumstances. Stalin exposed this slander, deeply analyzed the historical background and historical roots of Leninism's emergence, proved that Leninism was produced in the era of imperialism, that is, the era of proletarian revolution, and believed that the theoretical and tactical basis of Leninism was applicable and necessary for the working class of all countries.

Stalin developed the main issues in Leninism - the issues of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Stalin pointed out that bourgeois revolutions usually begin when relatively readily available capitalist economic forms are already in place. Bourgeois revolutions take the seizure of power as the end of the revolution. They are limited to replacing one exploiting group with another in power, so they do not need to destroy the old state machine. Unlike bourgeois revolutions, proletarian revolutions take place under conditions where there are no or almost no readily available socialist economic forms. The seizure of power by the proletarian revolution is only the beginning of the revolution, so it must destroy the old state machine and replace it with a new one.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is a long-term dictatorship and it is the tool for building a socialist economy. Its purpose: first, to defeat the resistance of the overthrown exploiting classes, to organize national defense to resist foreign armed intervention and aggression, and to strengthen ties with the proletarians of other countries; second, to finally sever the ties between the exploited working masses and the bourgeoisie, and to consolidate the alliance between the proletariat and these masses; third, to guide the broad masses of working people in socialist construction and to ensure the complete victory of socialism.

Based on the experience of the Soviet state, Stalin comprehensively studied the issue of the structure of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the guiding forces and levers or belts of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

"The levers or belts are the mass organizations of the proletariat, without relying on which the dictatorship cannot be realized.

The guiding force is the advanced force of the proletariat, that is, the vanguard of the proletariat, which is the main leading force of the dictatorship of the proletariat." (Page 32)

What are the mass organizations of the proletariat? They are trade unions, Soviets, cooperatives, and youth leagues. The Communist Party, as the guiding force of the dictatorship of the proletariat, unifies the work of all these mass organizations and directs their actions towards one goal. Without the leadership of the Party, it is impossible to carry out the unified proletarian struggle, there can be no slightly long-term and consolidated dictatorship, and the victory of the socialist cause cannot be guaranteed.

However, to say that the Party is the guiding force in the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat does not mean that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the Party. The Trotskyites distorted the Party's leading role and attempted to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with the "dictatorship of the Party," thereby undermining the correct relationship between the vanguard and its class. Stalin pointed out: "The dictatorship of the proletariat is the Party's instructions plus the implementation of these instructions by the mass organizations of the proletariat, plus the implementation of these instructions by the residents. … It can be seen that between the Party's instructions and the implementation of these instructions, there are the will and actions of the led, the will and actions of the class, the class's determination (or unwillingness) to support these instructions, the class's ability (or inability) to implement these instructions, the class's ability (or inability) to implement these instructions completely in accordance with the requirements of the environment, and so on." (Pages 38-39)

From this, it can be seen that in order to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Party must win the trust of its class. This trust is never gained by violence, but by the Party's correct theory and correct policy, the Party's loyalty to its class, the Party's connection with the working class masses, and the Party's persuasion of the masses, etc. The Party must listen to the opinions of the masses, study the practical experience of the masses' struggle, and check the correctness of its policies based on these. The Party should not only teach the masses, but also learn from the masses. The Party should not order the masses, but should first persuade the masses and help the masses to understand the correctness of the Party's policies based on their own experience, so the Party should be the leader, the leader, and the mentor of its class. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always followed this instruction in its leadership work, thereby ensuring the smooth solution of all major tasks in the cause of socialist construction. In order to undermine the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, and in order to make the Soviet people lose confidence in building socialism, the opposition tried their best to attack Lenin's theory that socialism could be victorious in one country. They used Engels' old formula on this issue as their theoretical basis. In "On Some Questions of Leninism" and "On the Possibility of Building Socialism in Our Country" and other articles, and in the report "On the Social Democratic Tendency in Our Party" and the conclusions on this report, Stalin demonstrated and defended Lenin's principle that socialism could be victorious in one country. Stalin pointed out that Lenin drew the conclusion that socialism could be victorious in one country from the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries. Engels believed in the 1840s that socialism could not be victorious in a single country, which is completely understandable. Because at that time, Engels could not foresee everything that might happen in the proletarian revolution in the period of monopoly capitalism more than 50 years later, so his formula was correct at that time. But in the new era, the era of imperialism, Engels' old formula is no longer applicable.

Stalin taught: "We must be good at distinguishing between the words and the essence of Marxism, distinguishing between the individual principles and methods of Marxism. The reason why Lenin was able to discover the truth that socialism can be victorious in one country is because he regarded Marxism not as a dogma but as a guide to action. He was not a slave to words, and he was good at grasping the main and fundamental things in Marxism." (Pages 272-273)

Following Lenin's principles, and based on the specific domestic and international environment of the Soviet Union at that time, Stalin demonstrated the issue of the victory of socialism. He said:

"… Our country has two kinds of contradictions: domestic contradictions and foreign contradictions. Domestic contradictions are primarily the struggle between socialist elements and capitalist elements. We say that we can overcome this contradiction by our own strength, that we can defeat the capitalist elements in our economy, that we can attract the basic peasant masses to participate in socialist construction, and build a socialist society.

Foreign contradictions are the struggle between socialist countries and capitalist encirclement. We say that we cannot solve this contradiction by our own strength alone. To solve this contradiction, socialism must be victorious in at least several countries." (Pages 292-293)

The entire historical development process after the great October Socialist Revolution has fully proved the correctness of this principle.

The opposition believed that the Soviet Union's technology was backward and that socialism could not be built. The opposition denied the possibility of peasants participating in socialist construction, and did not believe that the proletariat could attract the basic peasant masses to participate in socialist construction. The opposition's fallacy could only weaken the struggle of socialist elements against capitalist elements, thereby opening the way for the restoration of capitalism.

Stalin exposed the capitulationist essence of the opposition, demonstrated and developed Lenin's theory on the worker-peasant alliance. Stalin emphasized that the worker-peasant alliance is not just any kind of alliance, but a worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class engaged in socialist construction. The worker-peasant alliance is the basic principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the foundation of socialist construction. Consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is a necessary condition for establishing correct economic relations between urban and rural areas, between industry and agriculture, and is a necessary condition for ensuring the realization of industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The working class must and can guide the peasants to the path of socialism. Although peasants are non-socialist by their position, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, they should and will be able to embark on the path of socialist development, because they have no way to get rid of poverty and bankruptcy other than to combine with the proletariat, combine with socialist industry, and embark on the path of universal cooperation. Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, under the conditions that socialist industry plays a leading role, the universal cooperation of peasants means the transition of peasants to the socialist path.

Stalin pointed out that when exposing the Trotsky-Zinoviev faction's plan to undermine the worker-peasant alliance, peasants cannot be regarded as objects of exploitation by the working class. Destroying or weakening the worker-peasant alliance will make it impossible to achieve any major task. "...It is impossible to build socialism without peasants; similarly, it is impossible for peasants to get rid of poverty without the proletariat." (Page 89) The Communist Party of the Soviet Union resolutely implemented the policy of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance in leading the cause of socialist construction, and finally completely defeated the capitalist elements in the countryside, leading millions of peasants to the path of collectivization.

At that time in the Soviet Union, the central task of the Party was to struggle for the realization of the general line of national socialist industrialization. In the report "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy," Stalin elaborated in detail on the policy and path of socialist industrialization. Stalin pointed out:

"Not any development of industry can be regarded as industrialization. The center of industrialization, the foundation of industrialization, is to develop heavy industry (fuel, metals, etc.), and in the final analysis, to develop the production of the means of production and develop the country's own machine manufacturing industry." (Pages 112-113)

Stalin pointed out that the task of industrialization is not only to increase the proportion of industry in the entire national economy, but also to ensure the economic independence of the Soviet Union surrounded by capitalism, so that it does not become an appendage of capitalism.

When talking about the issue of socialist accumulation, Stalin believed that the transformation of capitalist factories and landlord's land into property of the whole people after the October Revolution created a powerful source of accumulation for industrial development. Socialist industrialization is different from capitalist industrialization. Capitalist industrialization is carried out by relying on plundering colonies, demanding war indemnities, enslaving foreign debts, and ruthlessly exploiting the broad masses of working people in their own country. Socialist industrialization is based on the public ownership of the means of production and the accumulation of wealth created by the labor of workers and peasants. On the other hand, socialist industrialization is closely linked with the continuous improvement of the material life of the working people, so it is also a matter of personal concern for all working people.

Stalin pointed out that to realize industrialization, it is necessary to improve labor productivity, reduce product costs, strengthen labor discipline, practice strict economy, train construction cadres, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the working class's leadership over the peasants, and implement the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Stalin's report is a programmatic document of national socialist industrialization, and has very great practical significance for our country, which is currently carrying out large-scale economic construction.

Party unity and unification, as well as the implementation of the principle of democracy within the Party, are extremely necessary to guarantee the realization of industrialization. In the speech "On Methods of Easing the Intra-Party Struggle," in the outline "On the Opposition Alliance within the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" that he drafted, and in other works, Stalin condemned the anti-Party split activities carried out by the opposition and exposed its opportunist essence. The opposition slandered the Party and the Party's leadership with various pretexts, attempting to weaken the prestige of the Party's leadership, thereby achieving its goal of usurping the Party's leadership. Stalin pointed out that abiding by Party discipline, obeying the Party's leadership, and maintaining the prestige of the Party's leading organs are important factors in increasing the Party's unity and unification. The opposition alliance intentionally distorted the significance of democracy within the Party. They shouted about democracy in words, but in fact they brutally undermined the principle of democracy, opposed democracy within the Party to Party discipline, confused the freedom of factional activities with democracy within the Party, and attempted to undermine Party discipline and Party unity under the guise of democracy. Stalin pointed out that the essence of democracy within the Party is to promote the enthusiasm of the Party members, consolidate the Party's unity, and make the Party members consciously abide by the Party's discipline. "Democracy within the Party is needed not to weaken and undermine the proletarian discipline within the Party, but to consolidate and strengthen this discipline" (Page 200). Stalin said: "The Party must protect the unity of its ranks like the apple of its eye" (Page 204). Stalin's principles on the Party's leading role in the dictatorship of the proletariat, on the Party's unity and unification, and on the democratic system within the Party armed the Bolshevik Party, and also armed the working-class parties of all countries, guaranteeing that the Communist Party correctly solves the practical problems in the Party's work and smoothly realizes the task of socialist-communist construction.

Also included in Volume VIII are many documents that are instructive to the international workers' revolutionary movement, such as "On the British Strike and the Polish Events," "On the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee," "On the Struggle Against Right-Wing and 'Ultra-Left' Tendencies," and other works. In these works, Stalin discussed the problems of international economic and political development, revealed the characteristics of the capitalist crisis, and pointed out the tasks of the working class and Communist Parties of various countries at that time.

In the report "On the British Strike and the Polish Events," Stalin analyzed the characteristics of the serious changes in the world capitalist system in the era of imperialism based on the principle of uneven capitalist development, revealed the fact that Britain's monopoly position had been lost, pointed out the causes and lessons of the failure of the British workers' strike, and pointed out to the working class of the world the necessity of uniting and carrying out political struggle to oppose imperialism and domestic reactionary forces.

In the speeches "On the Anglo-Russian Unity Committee" and "On the Anglo-Russian Committee," Stalin exposed the opposition's attempt to cover up the reactionary behavior of the British Trade Union leaders with false "left" rhetoric.

In the speeches at the meeting of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and at the meetings of the German Committee and the French Committee, Stalin pointed out to the fraternal Communist Parties what lessons should be learned in the struggle against right-wing and "ultra-left" tendencies. From the examples of the split activities of the right-wing and "ultra-left" factions within the French and German parties, Stalin revealed the harm of the arrogance, fear of criticism, and self-criticism of certain "leaders" to the workers' revolutionary movement. Stalin said: "Must we expose the mistakes of certain leaders of the Party? Must we make these mistakes public so that we can educate the Party members with the mistakes of the leaders? I think it is necessary. I think there is no other way to correct mistakes. I think the method of concealing mistakes is not our method." (Pages 6-7)

In the speech "On the Future of the Chinese Revolution," Stalin made a Marxist-Leninist analysis of the Chinese revolution, affirmed that the nature of the Chinese revolution was a bourgeois-democratic revolution, and also a national liberation revolution against imperialism. He pointed out that due to the weakness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, "the initiators and leaders of the Chinese revolution, the leaders of the Chinese peasants, will inevitably be assumed by the Chinese proletariat and its Party." (Page 322) Immediately satisfying the peasants' most urgent demands and launching a revolution in the countryside are the most necessary conditions for the victory of the Chinese revolution. One of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution is "armed revolution against armed counter-revolution" (Page 326). Stalin also gave clear instructions on the nature of the future revolutionary regime in China and on China's path of non-capitalist development, that is, the path of socialist development. These instructions have profound significance for the victory of the Chinese revolution.

The writings in Volume VIII of "The Complete Works of Stalin," like the writings in other volumes, are a great contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. These writings have very real guiding significance for our country, which is currently transitioning to socialism. It points out to us the basic direction that we should take after achieving revolutionary victory, it teaches us how to carry out socialist construction, it teaches us that we must defend the Party's unity and unification in construction, and that we must carry out a relentless struggle against the enemies inside and outside the Party. Studying Stalin's works in depth will strengthen our ideological arming.

    “斯大林全集”第八卷介绍
    陈山
    “斯大林全集”第八卷包括斯大林从一九二六年一月至十一月的著作。一九二六年是布尔什维克党和苏联历史上极重要的里程碑，是苏联人民在布尔什维克党领导下实现国家社会主义工业化总方针而展开紧张斗争的第一年。
    当时国内外的形势是：资本主义世界呈现着暂时的表面的局部的稳定。可是这种稳定并没有缓和资本主义固有的不可调和的矛盾，相反地，资本主义的矛盾和危机日益增长。国际帝国主义者认为苏联的巩固和发展直接威胁到他们本身的存在，于是千方百计地阻碍社会主义工业化的实现，破坏苏联的建设工作。另一方面，苏联国民经济中资本主义成分和社会主义成分之间的斗争日益复杂化。资本主义复辟分子托洛茨基—季诺维也夫反党联盟的活动反映了这一情况。他们敌意地曲解列宁主义，疯狂地进行反党的分裂活动，公开地反对社会主义工业化的计划，企图借此在苏联恢复资本主义，使苏联成为帝国主义的奴役对象。
    为了克服面临的种种困难，保证联共（布）第十四次代表大会制定的关于国家社会主义工业化总路线的实现，党必须教育全党和全国人民，使他们充分了解当前的国内外形势，加强他们对社会主义建设必获胜利的信念；必须揭露反对派联盟的投降主义实质，从思想上组织上彻底粉碎反对派，把全党紧紧地团结在党中央的周围。
    “斯大林全集”第八卷所包括的著作对于苏联人民为社会主义工业化而进行的斗争有着决定性的意义。在这些著作中，斯大林指出了革命进一步发展的方向和社会主义建设的前途，揭露了反对派的伪造马克思列宁主义的企图，打击了列宁主义的敌人，捍卫了并发展了列宁的伟大学说。
      “论列宁主义的几个问题”一文在第八卷中占有主要的地位。它是著者一九二四年所写“论列宁主义基础”这一历史性著作的继续和发展。斯大林在“论列宁主义的几个问题”中论述了马克思列宁主义中几个最重要的课题：作为马克思主义发展的更高阶段的列宁主义的国际意义、无产阶级专政的学说、苏维埃的作用、党在无产阶级专政体系中的作用、党和苏维埃的相互关系、作为无产阶级专政基础的工农联盟、以及党的建设基础和组织基础等。
    斯大林曾在“论列宁主义基础”一文中，给列宁主义下了一个经典式的定义：“列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。确切些说，列宁主义一般是无产阶级革命的理论和策略，特别是无产阶级专政的理论和策略。”（第十三页）但是，季诺维也夫分子企图抹煞列宁主义的伟大意义，把列宁主义说成是俄国的特殊情况的产物。斯大林揭穿了这种谰言，深刻地分析了列宁主义产生的历史背景和历史根源，证明了列宁主义是在帝国主义时代即无产阶级革命时代产生的，认为列宁主义是世界各国革命运动经验的总结，它的理论和策略基础对于世界各国工人阶级都是适用和必要的。
    斯大林发挥了列宁主义中的主要问题——无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的问题。斯大林指出：资产阶级革命通常是在较为现成的资本主义经济形式已经具备时开始发生的，资产阶级革命以取得政权为革命的终结，它只限于以一个剥削集团去代替另一个剥削集团执掌政权，所以它无须摧毁旧的国家机器；和此不同，无产阶级革命是在没有或几乎没有现成的社会主义经济形式的条件下发生的，无产阶级革命的取得政权只是革命的开始，所以它必须破坏旧的国家机器而代之以新的国家机器。
    无产阶级专政是一个长期的专政，它是建成社会主义经济的工具。它的目的：第一在于击破被推翻的剥削阶级的反抗，组织国防以抵御外国的武装干涉和进攻，加强和其他国家的无产者的联系；第二在于最后割断被剥削劳动群众同资产阶级的联系，巩固无产阶级同这些群众的联盟；第三在于引导广大劳动群众进行社会主义建设，保证社会主义的完全胜利。
    斯大林根据苏维埃国家的经验，全面地研究了无产阶级专政的结构的问题，无产阶级专政的指导力量和杠杆或引带的问题。
    “杠杆或引带就是无产阶级的群众组织，不依靠这些组织就无法实现专政。
    指导力量就是无产阶级的先进部队，就是无产阶级的先锋队，它是无产阶级专政的主要领导力量。”（第三十二页）
    无产阶级的群众组织是什么呢？它们就是工会、苏维埃、合作社和青年团。而作为无产阶级专政的指导力量的共产党，则把所有这些群众组织的工作统一起来，把它们的行动引向一个目标。没有党的领导，就无法进行统一的无产阶级的斗争，就不可能有稍微长期而巩固的专政，也就无法保证社会主义事业的胜利。
    然而说党是无产阶级专政体系中的指导力量，决不等于说无产阶级专政就是党专政。托洛茨基分子歪曲党的领导作用，企图以“党专政”来代替无产阶级专政，从而破坏先锋队和本阶级之间的正确相互关系。斯大林指出：“无产阶级专政是党的指示加上无产阶级群众组织对这些指示的实行，再加上居民对这些指示的实行。……可见在党的指示和这些指示的实施之间有被领导者的意志和行动，本阶级的意志和行动，本阶级决心（或不愿意）拥护这些指示，本阶级善于（或不善于）实行这些指示，本阶级善于（或不善于）完全依照环境的要求来实行这些指示等等情况。”（第三十八——三十九页）
    由此可见，为要实现无产阶级专政，党必须取得本阶级的信任。这种信任的取得决不是依靠暴力，而是要依靠党的正确理论和正确政策、党对本阶级的忠诚、党和工人阶级群众的联系，以及党对群众的说服等等。党必须倾听群众的意见，研究群众的斗争实践并根据这些来检查自己的政策的正确性，党不仅应当教导群众，而且应当向群众学习。党不应当命令群众，而首先应当说服群众，帮助群众根据本身经验来认识党的政策的正确性，所以党应当是本阶级的领导者、领袖和导师。苏联共产党在自己的领导工作中一向遵循这个指示，从而保证了社会主义建设事业中一切重大任务的顺利解决。为了破坏苏联的社会主义建设，为了使苏联人民失去建成社会主义的信心，反对派竭力攻击列宁关于社会主义可能在一个国家内胜利的学说。他们拿恩格斯关于这个问题的旧公式来作为自己的理论根据。斯大林在“论列宁主义的几个问题”和“关于我国建成社会主义的可能性”等文中，在“论我们党内的社会民主主义倾向”的报告和关于这一报告的结论中，论证了和捍卫了列宁的社会主义可能在一个国家内胜利这一原理。斯大林指出，列宁是从资本主义国家经济政治发展不平衡的规律得出社会主义可能在一个国家内胜利的结论的。恩格斯在十九世纪四十年代认为社会主义不可能在单独一个国家内获得胜利，这是完全可以理解的。因为当时恩格斯还无法预见到五十多年以后即垄断资本主义时期无产阶级革命中可能发生的一切，所以他的公式在当时是正确的。可是在新时代即帝国主义时代，恩格斯的旧公式就不再适用了。
    斯大林教导说：“要善于区别马克思主义的字句和实质，区别马克思主义的个别原理和方法。列宁所以能够发现社会主义在一个国家内胜利的真理，因为他认为马克思主义不是教条而是行动的指南，他没有做字句的奴隶，他善于抓住马克思主义中主要的、基本的东西。”（第二七二——二七三页）
    斯大林遵循列宁的原理，根据当时苏联的国内外具体环境，论证了社会主义胜利的问题。他说：
  “……我国有两种矛盾：国内矛盾和国外矛盾。国内矛盾首先在于社会主义成分和资本主义成分的斗争。我们说，这种矛盾我们是能够靠本身的力量来克服的，我们能够战胜我国经济中的资本主义成分，能够吸引基本农民群众参加社会主义建设，并建成社会主义社会。
    国外矛盾在于社会主义国家和资本主义包围的斗争。我们说，这种矛盾我们只靠本身的力量是不能解决的，要解决这种矛盾，必须社会主义至少在几个国家内获得胜利。”（第二九二——二九三页）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命以后的整个历史发展进程，完全证明这一原理的正确。
    反对派认为苏联技术落后，不能建成社会主义。反对派否认农民有参加社会主义建设的可能性，不相信无产阶级能够吸引基本农民群众参加社会主义建设。反对派的谬论只能削弱社会主义成分对资本主义成分的斗争，从而为资本主义的复辟开辟道路。
    斯大林揭露了反对派的投降主义实质，论证了和发展了列宁关于工农联盟的学说。斯大林强调指出，工农联盟不是随便一种什么联盟，而是在工人阶级领导下的从事社会主义建设的工农联盟。工农联盟是无产阶级专政的基本原则，是社会主义建设的基础。巩固工农联盟是建立城乡间、工农业间的正确经济关系的必要条件，是保证实现工业化和对农业实行社会主义改造的必要条件。
    工人阶级必须而且也可能引导农民走上社会主义的道路。农民按其地位来说虽然是非社会主义的，但是在无产阶级专政的条件下，他们应当走上而且一定能走上社会主义发展的道路，因为他们除了和无产阶级结合，除了和社会主义工业结合，除了走上普遍合作化的道路以外，没有而且也不可能有摆脱贫困和破产的道路。在无产阶级专政条件下，在社会主义工业起领导作用的条件下，农民的普遍合作化意味着农民的转上社会主义轨道。
    斯大林在揭露托洛茨基—季诺维也夫分子的破坏工农联盟计划时指出，不能把农民看成工人阶级剥削的对象。破坏或削弱工农联盟就不能实现任何一个巨大任务。“……建设社会主义没有农民是不行的；同样地，农民要摆脱贫困，没有无产阶级也是不可能的。”（第八十九页）苏联共产党在领导社会主义建设事业中，坚决地执行了巩固工农联盟的方针，终于在农村中最后战胜了资本主义成分，把千百万农民群众引上了集体化的道路。
    在当时的苏联，党的中心任务就是为实现国家社会主义工业化的总路线而斗争。斯大林在“关于苏联经济状况和党的政策”这一报告中，详尽地阐述了社会主义工业化的方针和道路。斯大林指出：
  “不是发展任何一种工业都算做工业化。工业化的中心，工业化的基础，就是发展重工业（燃料、金属等等），归根到底，就是发展生产资料的生产，发展本国的机器制造业。”（第一一二——一一三页）
    斯大林指出工业化的任务不仅在于增加工业在整个国民经济中的比重，而且在于保证受资本主义包围的苏联在经济上的独立，使它不致变成资本主义的附属品。
    谈到社会主义积累问题时，斯大林认为十月革命后资本家的工厂和地主的土地之变成全民财产，为工业发展造成了强大的积累来源。社会主义工业化和资本主义工业化不同，资本主义工业化是依靠掠夺殖民地、索取战争的赔款、奴役性的外债以及无情地剥削本国广大劳动群众来实行的，社会主义工业化却是以生产资料公有制、以工农劳动所创造的财富的积累为基础的。另一方面，社会主义工业化是和不断提高劳动者的物质生活密切相联系的，因此，它也是全体劳动者的切身事业。
    斯大林指出，要实现工业化，必须提高劳动生产率，减低产品的成本，加强劳动纪律，厉行节约，培养建设干部，巩固工农联盟，加强工人阶级对农民的领导，以及实行农业的社会主义改造。
    斯大林的这一报告是国家社会主义工业化的纲领性文献，对于正在进行大规模经济建设的我国说来，具有非常巨大的现实意义。
    党的团结和统一以及贯彻党内的民主原则，对于保证工业化的实现是极端必要的。斯大林在“关于缓和党内斗争的办法”的演说中、在他所草拟的“关于联共（布）党内的反对派联盟”的提纲中以及其他著作中，斥责了反对派所进行的反党分裂活动，揭穿了它的机会主义实质。反对派用种种借口诽谤党，诽谤党的领导，企图削弱党的领导的威信，从而达到其篡夺党的领导的目的。斯大林指出了遵守党纪、服从党的领导，以及维护党的领导机关的威信，是增加党的团结和统一的重要因素。反对派联盟有意曲解党内民主的意义，他们口头上大叫民主，事实上却极粗暴地破坏民主原则，把党内民主和党的纪律对立起来，把派别活动的自由同党内民主混为一谈，企图借着民主的幌子来破坏党的纪律和党的统一。斯大林指出，党内民主的实质就是发扬党员群众的积极性，巩固党的统一，使党员群众自觉地遵守党的纪律。“党内民主所以需要，不是为了削弱并破坏党内的无产阶级纪律，而是为了巩固并加强这个纪律”（第二○○页）。斯大林说：“党必须像保护眼珠一样保护自己队伍的统一”（第二○四页）。斯大林关于党在无产阶级专政中的领导作用、关于党的统一和团结、以及关于党内民主制度等原理，武装了布尔什维克党，同时也武装了世界各国工人阶级政党，保证了共产党正确地解决党的工作中的实际问题和顺利实现社会主义——共产主义建设的任务。
    编入第八卷中的还有许多对于国际工人革命运动具有指导性的文献，如“关于英国罢工和波兰事件”、“关于英俄统一委员会”、“关于反对右倾和‘极左’倾的斗争”和其他著作。在这些著作中，斯大林论述了国际经济政治发展的问题，揭示了资本主义危机的特征，并指出了各国工人阶级和共产党当时斗争的任务。
    在“关于英国罢工和波兰事件”这一报告中，斯大林根据资本主义发展不平衡的原理，分析了世界资本主义体系在帝国主义时代发生严重变化的特点，揭示了英国垄断地位的丧失的事实，指出了英国工人罢工失败的原因和教训，并向全世界工人阶级指明团结一致进行政治斗争来反对帝国主义和国内反动势力的必要性。
    在“关于英俄统一委员会”和“关于英俄委员会”这两篇演说中，斯大林揭露了反对派以虚伪的
  “左”的词藻来替英国工联头子的反动行为作掩护的企图。
    在共产国际执行委员会主席团会议上和德国委员会、法国委员会会议上的演说中，斯大林给兄弟共产党指出在反对右倾和“极左”倾的斗争中应得到什么样的教训。斯大林从法国和德国党内的右派和“极左”派的分裂活动的例子中，揭示某些
  “领袖”的高傲自大、害怕批评和自我批评的情绪对于工人革命运动的危害性。斯大林说：“我们是否必须揭露党的某些领导者的错误呢？我们是否必须把这些错误公开出来，以便能够用领导者的错误来教育党员群众呢？我以为是必须的。我以为别的纠正错误的方法是没有的。我以为掩饰错误的方法不是我们的方法。”（第六——七页）
    在“论中国革命的前途”的演说中，斯大林对中国革命作了马克思列宁主义的分析，肯定了中国革命的性质是资产阶级民主革命，同时也是反对帝国主义的民族解放革命。他指出，由于中国民族资产阶级的软弱，“中国革命的倡导者和领导者，中国农民的领袖，必不可免地要由中国无产阶级及其政党来担任。”（第三二二页）立即满足农民最迫切的要求，在农村中掀起革命，是中国革命胜利的最必要的条件。中国革命的特点之一，就是“武装的革命反对武装的反革命”（第三二六页）。关于中国未来革命政权的性质，关于中国的非资本主义发展的道路，即社会主义发展的道路，斯大林也作了明确的指示。这些指示对于中国革命的胜利具有极深刻的意义。
    “斯大林全集”第八卷中的著作，也像其他各卷中的著作一样，对于马克思列宁主义宝库是一个伟大的贡献。这些著作对于正在向社会主义过渡的我国，具有非常现实的指导意义。它给我们指出取得革命胜利以后应当走的基本方向，它教导我们如何进行社会主义建设，教导我们在建设中必须保卫党的统一和团结，必须同党内外的敌人进行无情的斗争。深刻地研究斯大林的著作，将加强我们的思想武装。
