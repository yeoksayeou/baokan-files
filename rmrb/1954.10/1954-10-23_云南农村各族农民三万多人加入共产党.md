    In the process of vigorous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the vast rural areas of Yunnan Province, 31,519 outstanding farmers of various ethnic groups have joined the Communist Party of China, and 3,239 village branches have been established. Now, in all villages where agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established, Party branches and groups have been established. These Party members were originally activists in the countryside and were admitted to the Party after careful review. Now they have become the backbone force in promoting the vigorous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At present, a total of 435 Communist Party members serve as chairmen and vice-chairmen of agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the province. Communist Party members Li Neng and Zhang Huiying, with the help of the Party organization, have become well-known agricultural labor models in the province. The two agricultural producers' cooperatives they lead have also become models of mutual aid and cooperation for farmers of all ethnic groups in the province. Communist Party member Ma Erruo, a Yi woman, under the guidance of the Party, helped the Yi farmers in Mengyangba, Yuanjiang County, establish the first agricultural producers' cooperative last year. This cooperative achieved a bumper harvest in its first year, and the members sold more than 10,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. This spring, Ma Erruo and other Party members led the Lisu, Dai, and Yi farmers in Ganzhuang to overcome the drought and also helped local farmers of all ethnic groups to establish mutual aid teams together. Twenty-eight Yi households in Daoguang寨 and Zhong寨 villages in Manlian Township, Simao County, who had newly moved down from the mountains, with the help of the Communist Party organization, eliminated their concerns about being discriminated against and joined the agricultural producers' cooperative this autumn.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party organization and the guidance of Party members, many areas in the province have embarked on the road of collectivization as entire villages. All thirty-seven households of Xinfa Village, inhabited by the Sani people in Yiliang County, have joined the agricultural producers' cooperative. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the farmers of Yongxin Township have also joined mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    This year, the Communist Party organizations throughout the province led and relied on the strength of mutual aid and cooperative organizations to lead the farmers to overcome natural disasters and overcome difficulties in production, ensuring increased grain production. The Communist Party organization of Gaoping Township, Eshan Yi Autonomous County, in the drought resistance struggle this spring, first led the members of the agricultural producers' cooperative to build sixteen small water retaining dams in the mountain gullies, accumulated water, and led four mutual aid teams to actively find water sources, help the masses implement reasonable water use, and improve farming techniques. By autumn, the crops in this township had increased by 50%. (Xinhua News Agency)

    云南农村各族农民三万多人加入共产党
    云南省广大农村在互助合作运动的大发展过程中，已有三万一千五百一十九个优秀的各族农民参加了中国共产党，并建立了三千二百三十九个乡村支部。现在，凡是建立了农业生产合作社的乡村，大都已经有了党的支部和小组。这些党员原来都是农村中的积极分子，经过慎重的审查以后吸收入党。现在他们已经成为推动互助合作运动大发展的骨干力量。目前，全省担任农业生产合作社正、副社长的共产党员共有四百三十五人。共产党员李能和张惠英，在党组织的帮助下，已成为全省著名的农业劳动模范。他们领导的两个农业生产合作社也已成为全省各族农民互助合作的榜样。共产党员、彝族妇女马二婼，去年在党的指示下，帮助元江县猛仰坝的彝族农民建立了第一个农业生产合作社，这个社第一年就获得了丰收，社员们把一万多斤余粮卖给了国家。今年春天，马二婼和其他党员一起，又领导甘庄的傈僳、傣、彝等族农民战胜了干旱，还帮助当地各族农民在一起成立了互助组。思茅县曼连乡刀光寨和中寨新从山上下坝的二十八户彝族农民，在共产党组织的帮助下，消除了怕受歧视的顾虑，并在今年秋天参加了农业生产合作社。
    在共产党组织的领导和党员的带领下，全省已有不少地区整村地走上了合作化道路。宜良县撒尼族聚居的新发村三十七户农民已全体参加了农业生产合作社。永新乡的农民在党的组织的领导下，也都参加了互助组或农业生产合作社。
    今年，全省各地的共产党组织领导和依靠互助合作组织的力量，带动农民战胜自然灾害，克服生产中的困难，保证了粮食的增产。峨山县彝族自治区高平乡共产党组织在今年春天的抗旱斗争中，首先领导农业生产合作社的社员在山沟中修筑十六条小的拦水坝，积了水，并带动四个互助组积极寻找水源，帮助群众实行合理用水，改进耕作技术，到秋天，这个乡的庄稼增产了五成。　（新华社）
