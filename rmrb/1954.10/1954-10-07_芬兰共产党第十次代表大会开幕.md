Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, October 3rd: The 10th Congress of the Communist Party of Finland opened in Helsinki on the 2nd. Attending the congress were 314 delegates, as well as Finnish guests and representatives from fraternal parties of 14 countries.

The Chairman of the Communist Party of Finland, A. A. Aaltonen, delivered the opening address. He said: The 10th Congress of the Communist Party of Finland is being held ten years after the armistice agreement was concluded between Finland and the Soviet Union. Ten years of peaceful development have proven that maintaining friendly relations with the great Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries is very beneficial to Finland.

After analyzing the domestic situation in Finland, Aaltonen mentioned the growing influence of the Communist Party among the Finnish working people. He emphasized that the People's Democratic Movement and the Communist Party have achieved definite successes. The growing support that the People's Democrats have received in municipal and parliamentary elections proves this.

Aaltonen then said: The reason for these achievements is that the Party has implemented correct policies, because the members understand the Party's policies and tasks, and work diligently and skillfully to achieve these policies and tasks.

After Aaltonen's opening address, the congress elected a presidium. The presidium was composed of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Finland, Ville Pessi, Chairman Aaltonen, other leaders of the Communist Party of Finland, and representatives of the fraternal parties attending the congress.

Amidst warm cheers and stormy applause, the congress read out the congratulatory messages from Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as from fraternal parties of other countries.

In the evening session of the 2nd, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Finland, Ville Pessi, delivered the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland to the congress.

In his report, Pessi first pointed out the great significance of the Soviet-Finnish armistice agreement signed on September 19, 1944. Pessi pointed out that peace enabled the Finnish people to regain the democratic rights that had been deprived in the past. Over the past ten years, the Communist Party of Finland has grown into a mass party and has become the center of Finnish democratic politics.

Talking about foreign policy, he emphasized that the Communist Party of Finland has always adhered to the principle that Finland should be free and independent, that Finland should handle foreign relations based on its own interests, and that it should rely on international forces of peace.

Talking about domestic economic issues, he said: The way for the Finnish people to avoid economic poverty is to cooperate with the Soviet Union and other countries in the democratic camp.

Pessi then spoke in detail about the need to guarantee the unity of the working class. He pointed out that the main obstacle to unity is that the Leskinen faction in the Social Democratic Party cooperates with the bourgeoisie and refuses to cooperate with the Communist Party. Pessi pointed out that the Communist Party of Finland is willing to cooperate with Social Democrats and members of the Agrarian League. Cooperation with the Social Democratic Party on issues related to all working people is not a temporary policy, but a policy that the Party has consistently pursued in the past and is now willing to emphasize in particular.

Pessi also spoke about the need to establish a consolidated fighting alliance of workers and working peasants. It is necessary to cooperate with the democratic forces in the Agrarian League. Pessi emphasized the importance of cooperation among all democratic forces.

Pessi spoke about the task of consolidating the Communist Party. He said that the Party currently unites tens of thousands of workers, small farmers and staff, and the recent parliamentary elections have proved that its influence is growing.

Pessi concluded by saying: The Communist Party of Finland should especially develop and consolidate itself in the struggle to win the unity of the working class, to establish a fighting alliance of workers and peasants, to raise the living standards of the Finnish people, and to fight for democracy, socialism and peace.

The congress then began to discuss Pessi's report.

    芬兰共产党第十次代表大会开幕
   【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社赫尔辛基三日讯：芬兰共产党第十次代表大会二日在赫尔辛基开幕。出席大会的有代表三百一十四名，列席大会的有芬兰来宾和来自十四个国家的兄弟党的代表。
    芬兰共产党主席阿尔托宁致开幕词。他说：芬兰共产党第十次代表大会是在芬兰和苏联缔结停战协定以后十年举行的。十年的和平发展证明和伟大的苏联及一切爱好和平的国家维持友好关系对于芬兰是非常有益的。
    阿尔托宁在分析芬兰国内形势后提到共产党在芬兰劳动人民中间的日益增长的影响。他着重指出：人民民主运动和共产党已取得了肯定的成就，人民民主人士在市政选举和议会选举中得到的日益增长的支持证明了这一点。
    阿尔托宁接着说：所以能够获得这些成就，是因为党实行了正确的政策，是因为党员们了解党的方针和任务，并且勤奋地、熟练地努力去实现这些方针任务。
    在阿尔托宁致开幕词后，代表大会选出了一个主席团。这个主席团由芬兰共产党总书记培西、主席阿尔托宁、芬兰共产党的其他领导人员以及参加这次代表大会的兄弟党的代表所组成。
    在热烈的欢呼和暴风雨般的掌声中，代表大会宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会、中国共产党中央委员会以及其他国家兄弟党致大会的贺电。
    在二日晚上的会议上，芬兰共产党总书记培西向大会作了芬兰共产党中央委员会的报告。
    培西在报告中首先指出一九四四年九月十九日签订的芬苏停战协定的重大意义。培西指出，和平使芬兰人民重新得到了过去被剥夺了的民主权利。芬兰共产党在过去十年内，已经成长为一个群众性的大党，成为芬兰民主政治的中心。
    培西谈到外交政策，他着重指出，芬兰共产党一贯坚持这样的原则：芬兰应当自由和独立，芬兰应当根据本国的利益处理对外关系，并依靠国际和平力量。
    谈到国内经济问题时，他说：芬兰人民免于经济贫困的出路，就是和苏联以及民主阵营的其他国家合作。
    培西又详细地谈到必须保证工人阶级的团结。他指出，团结的主要障碍就是社会民主党中的勒斯基宁一派和资产阶级进行合作，拒绝和共产党合作。培西指出，芬兰共产党愿意和社会民主党人以及农民联盟的盟员合作。在与全体劳动人民有关的问题上和社会民主党实行合作不是什么临时的政策，而是党过去一贯奉行，现在愿意特别强调的政策。
    培西还谈到必须建立工人及劳动农民的巩固的战斗联盟。必须和农民联盟中的民主力量进行合作。培西强调了一切民主力量实行合作的重要性。
    培西谈到了巩固共产党的任务。他说，目前党团结了上万的工人、小农和职员，最近一次议会选举证明，它的影响在增长中。
    培西最后说：芬兰共产党特别应该在争取工人阶级的团结，争取建立战斗的工农联盟，争取提高芬兰人民的生活水平，以及争取民主、社会主义和和平的斗争中发展和巩固起来。
    大会接着开始讨论培西的报告。
