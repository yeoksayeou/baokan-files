Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 29th: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its general debate on the issue of disarmament on the 26th and voted on various proposals on this issue on the 27th. The committee unanimously passed the joint proposal by Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

At the meeting on the 26th, Indian representative Menon spoke. Menon pointed out that the Soviet Union's adoption of the Anglo-French suggestions as a basis has moved the discussion of this major issue forward. Regarding the differences on the issue of a supervisory system, Menon said that he did not fully understand the Soviet Union's suggestion of adopting different forms of supervision in the two stages of disarmament. At the same time, he opposed the Western countries' demands for granting special powers to the supervisory机构 (supervisory body). Menon condemned the claim by some national representatives that the principle of unanimity among the great powers should not be used when dealing with the implementation of the convention on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, believing that such a claim was an attempt to "tamper with" the United Nations Charter "from the back door." Menon advocated the unconditional prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. He pointed out that the so-called "except in cases of resisting aggression" provision in the proposals of some major powers essentially leaves a loophole for the use of these weapons, especially when the concept of aggression has not yet been determined.

Menon stated that the Indian delegation supports the five-nation proposal. He also put forward his own proposal, suggesting that the United Nations Disarmament Commission seek the possibility of reaching an agreement on "stopping the arms race" before a disarmament agreement is reached.

After Menon's speech, the chairman announced that the general debate on the issue of disarmament had come to an end and that the discussion of proposals would begin. The Philippine representative announced the withdrawal of the proposal previously put forward by his delegation.

At the meeting on the 27th, British representative Dixon spoke. Instead of focusing on points of agreement, he emphasized the remaining differences between the Soviet Union and the Western countries. He said that the Soviet Union's rejection of the American so-called "working paper" might create new difficulties in seeking further consensus in the Disarmament Commission in the future.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky then spoke. Responding to Dixon's comments, he said that it is possible to overcome existing difficulties in the presence of a common and consistent basis. He pointed out that the Anglo-French suggestions, rather than the American "working paper," serve as this common basis.

The joint proposal by Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom was unanimously passed. Committee Chairman Urrutia of Colombia, on behalf of the committee, congratulated the five national delegations on their success and pointed out that the committee's unanimous passage of a resolution on such a major issue has great political significance.

Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom put forward a suggestion to submit the Indian proposal to the Disarmament Commission "for appropriate discussion." The Indian representative expressed his agreement. This suggestion passed with fifty-eight votes.

El Salvador suggested that the Australian proposal not be voted on, but be submitted to the Disarmament Commission for consideration. The Australian proposal suggested that the United Nations Secretariat compile a document explaining the views of major powers on various aspects of the disarmament issue. The El Salvadorian suggestion passed with forty-seven votes.

    联大政委会结束关于裁军问题的辩论
    通过苏联等五国联合提案
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在二十六日结束了关于裁减军备问题的一般性辩论，并在二十七日就这个问题的各项提案，进行了表决。委员会一致通过了加、法、苏、美、英五国联合提案。
    在二十六日的会议上，印度代表梅农发言。梅农指出，苏联采纳了英法建议作为基础，使这一重大问题的讨论向前推进了一步。梅农谈到在监督制度问题上的分歧，他说，他不完全理解苏联关于在裁军的两个阶段中采取不同的监督形式的建议。他同时反对西方国家关于给予监督机构特别权力的要求。梅农谴责某些国家代表在处理裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的公约的履行情况时不要使用大国一致协议的原则的主张，他认为这种主张是企图
  “从后门来篡改”联合国宪章。梅农主张无条件禁止大规模毁灭性武器。他指出，某些大国的建议中规定所谓“抵抗侵略的情况除外”，实质上是要为使用这些武器留出后路，特别是在侵略的概念尚未确定的情况之下。
    梅农表示印度代表团支持五国提案，他同时提出自己的一个提案，建议联合国裁军委员会在裁军协议没有达成以前，先寻求取得“停止扩军”的协议的可能。
    在梅农发言以后，主席宣布：关于裁军问题的一般性辩论便告结束，开始讨论提案。菲律宾代表宣布，撤销他的代表团以前提出的提案。
    在二十七日的会议上，英国代表狄克逊发言，他不着重指出意见一致的问题，而着重指出苏联和西方国家之间尚有的分歧。他说，苏联拒绝美国的所谓“工作文件”，可能使今后在裁军委员会谋求观点进一步一致的时候造成新的困难。
    苏联代表维辛斯基接着发言。他答复狄克逊的意见说，在具有共同一致的基础的情况下，克服现有的困难是可能的。他指出，作为这种共同基础的是英法的建议，而不是美国的“工作文件”。
    加、法、苏、美、英五国联合提案被全体一致通过。委员会主席哥伦比亚代表乌鲁蒂亚代表委员会祝贺五国代表团的成功，并指出委员会一致通过如此重大问题的决议，具有重大政治意义。
    加、法、苏、美、英五国提出一项建议：把印度提案交裁军委员会“进行相应的讨论”。印度代表表示同意。这项建议以五十八票通过。
    萨尔瓦多建议不表决澳大利亚的提案，而把它交裁军委员会审理，澳大利亚的提案建议联合国秘书处编制一项文件，说明各大国对裁军问题的各个方面的看法。萨尔瓦多建议以四十七票通过。
