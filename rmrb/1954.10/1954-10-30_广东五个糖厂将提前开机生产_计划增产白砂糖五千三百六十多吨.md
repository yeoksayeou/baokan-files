Five sugar factories affiliated with the state-owned Guangdong Sugar Industry Company have decided to start crushing sugarcane on November 1st, ahead of schedule, and plan to increase the production of refined sugar by over five thousand three hundred tons.

This year, the sugarcane planting area in Guangdong Province totals over one million mu (more than ten thousand mu more than last year), and the yield per unit area is estimated to be generally higher than last year, providing favorable conditions for increased sugar production. To welcome the sugarcane production season, the state-owned Guangdong Sugar Industry Company held a joint meeting of factory directors in mid-October, which determined the increased production targets for each factory this year: Dongguan Sugar Factory to increase production by 1,464 tons, Shunde Sugar Factory to increase production by 1,027 tons, Shitou Sugar Factory to increase production by 815 tons, Zini Sugar Factory to increase production by 1,124 tons, and Jieyang Sugar Factory to increase production by 933 tons. The total increase for the five factories compared to the production tasks recently issued by the Ministry of Light Industry is 5,363 tons of refined sugar. It was also decided to start production on November 1st, ahead of schedule (in previous years, production generally started at the end of November).

During the off-season this year, these five sugar factories systematically carried out various production preparations. While overhauling the machinery, each factory also adjusted and added equipment, increasing the sugarcane crushing capacity. For example, the daily sugarcane crushing capacity of Zini Sugar Factory will increase from 1,000 tons in the previous crushing season to 1,300 tons, which will increase the monthly production of white sugar by 1,000 tons. At present, the pre-production preparations for each factory are largely in place, and no-load testing has started successively. After the test runs, each factory will spend two days on trial crushing. Workers have expressed their determination to change the shortcomings of many accidents and failure to meet production targets at the beginning of crushing in previous years, and strive for safe production immediately after the official start of operations.

    广东五个糖厂将提前开机生产
    计划增产白砂糖五千三百六十多吨
    国营广东制糖工业公司所属五个糖厂决定提前在十一月一日开机榨蔗，并计划增产白砂糖五千三百多吨。
    今年广东全省植蔗面积有一百多万亩（比去年增加了十多万亩），单位面积产量估计比去年普遍提高，给食糖的增产提供了有利的条件。为迎接蔗糖生产季节的到来，国营广东制糖工业公司于十月中旬召开了厂长联席会议，确定了各厂今年的增产指标：东莞糖厂增产一千四百六十四吨，顺德糖厂增产一千零二十七吨，市头糖厂增产八百一十五吨，紫坭糖厂增产一千一百二十四吨，揭阳糖厂增产九百三十三吨，五厂共计比轻工业部最近下达的产量任务增加白砂糖五千三百六十三吨，并决定提前于十一月一日开机生产（往年一般是在十一月底开机）。
    这五个糖厂在今年停榨期间有步骤地做了各方面的生产准备工作。各厂在检修机器的同时，还调整和增添了设备，使榨蔗能力有了增长。如紫坭糖厂每天的榨蔗量将从上一榨季的一千吨提高到一千三百吨，每月将可增产白糖一千吨。目前各厂生产前的准备工作已大体就绪，并先后开始无负荷试机。在试机后各厂将以两天的时间进行试榨。工人们纷纷表示，要改变往年开榨初期事故多、不能达到生产指标等缺点，争取在正式开机后即能安全生产。
