Dear Chinese friends! Respected comrades!

I am very honored to be able to, on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, as the head of the government delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic, extend the warmest congratulations from the government of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and the entire people of Czechoslovakia to the fraternal Chinese people, the government of the People's Republic of China, the heroic Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people.

We pay tribute to the great nation of the People's Republic of China, with its thousands of years of history and culture. We pay tribute to the achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, after decades of heroic struggle – the People's Republic of China. We pay tribute to the motherland of which the Chinese people are proud, the new state of happiness for the Chinese working people – the People's Republic of China. We pay tribute to the powerful creator of the new destiny of the Asian people, and the great power that, together with the Soviet Union, plays an outstanding role not only in the cause of peace and the Asian people's struggle for freedom and independence, but also in the cause of defending world peace – the People's Republic of China. We express our deep gratitude for the lofty and fruitful peace activities carried out by the representatives of the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference. At the same time, we express our indignation and firm opposition to the actions of the US imperialist aggressors in piecing together the Southeast Asia military bloc. We are confident that the People's Republic of China, friendly to the people of all Asian countries, will be able to ensure the consolidation and expansion of the Asian peace zone. We are convinced that the Chinese people, who have already achieved great achievements and have won the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, will surely be able to liberate Taiwan victoriously. The great power sovereignty and its peaceful aspirations of great China, with a population of over 600 million, must be respected. The entire people of Czechoslovakia fully support all calls for the People's Republic of China to obtain equal status in the United Nations.

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on the great achievements they have made in the cause of economic, social, and cultural reform in vast China, and we sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on the great achievements they have made on the road to socialism. We join you in celebrating the adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is a great milestone in the historical development of China and makes the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China even more glorious and grand. To this end, we extend our congratulations to the Chinese people. We express our sincere joy at the fact that the newly adopted Constitution of the People's Republic of China is the foundation of the new people's democratic political life of the Chinese people.

We wish the People's Republic of China, which possesses endless treasures, and the hard-working and brave Chinese people even greater prosperity.

We are honored that since the founding of the People's Republic of China five years ago, the relations between Czechoslovakia and China have developed so vigorously and comprehensively. We would like to assure you that we will cherish the sincere friendship of the Chinese people very much. The Czechoslovak people have a deep admiration and sincere love for the Chinese people. Although we are tens of thousands of kilometers apart, we feel that we are closely linked with great China because we have a common ally, the most loyal friend of our two peoples, our common example, and dear Soviet Union unites us. Just as the People's Republic of China is on the eastern border of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, the Czechoslovak Republic will also dedicate all its strength on the western border of this camp to the sacred cause of peace and the struggle for freedom for the people, to the cause of benefiting the working people, and to the happy future of mankind.

On behalf of the government delegation of Czechoslovakia, I shout:

May the fraternal Chinese people advance more smoothly on the road to socialism!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the people's democratic constitution of the People's Republic of China!

Long live the heroic Communist Party of China!

May the friendship between the Chinese and Czech people, who jointly love the great Soviet Union, be further consolidated!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people and Chairman of the People's Republic of China!
