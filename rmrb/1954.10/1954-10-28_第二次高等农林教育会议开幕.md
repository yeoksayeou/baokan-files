The Second National Higher Agricultural and Forestry Education Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Forestry of the People's Republic of China, opened in Beijing on the 27th. This conference will determine the principles, tasks, and training objectives of higher agricultural and forestry education based on the country's general task during the transition period, clarify how to better serve the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production on the existing foundation in the future; study how to further comprehensively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in conjunction with China's actual situation, and steadily advance teaching reform; study necessary professional settings and adjustment plans, the development scale of various schools, teacher training plans, and appropriately solve the needs of school farms, forest farms, and pastures.

Minister of Higher Education Yang Xiufeng delivered the opening speech, in which he asked the attendees to pay attention to the study of higher agricultural and forestry education and to summarize and promote China's inherent agricultural production experience. He said: The experience of agricultural production with thousands of years of history is a valuable legacy of our nation, which must be summarized, and its scientific achievements should be promoted and applied in our higher agricultural and forestry education. Because China's past agricultural and forestry education was deeply influenced by European and American bourgeois ideas, with the exception of a few scholars who valued the scientific heritage of the motherland, the vast majority of people ignored it. Even today, we still do not give it the due attention, and some people even have incorrect views and erroneous attitudes towards the heritage of the motherland. This conference should examine and review this. Our higher agricultural and forestry educators should treat the issue of promoting the agricultural scientific heritage of the motherland with a very serious attitude, making this work a serious task in our teaching and scientific research work. Regarding the issue of comprehensively learning from the advanced educational experience of the Soviet Union in conjunction with China's actual situation, Yang Xiufeng pointed out that improving teaching content with the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism and cultivating cadres suitable for socialist construction is the central requirement of teaching reform. In order to achieve this requirement, there must be corresponding reforms in the teaching organization and teaching system to ensure the smooth progress of the teaching reform work. We must work in accordance with the working policy of steady progress, appropriately speed up the pace, but we must not forget the specific situation, and we must not make excessive demands or avoid confusion. When talking about the leadership relationship of agricultural and forestry colleges, Yang Xiufeng emphasized that whether they are directly led by the central government or entrusted to provincial and municipal leadership, they must further rely on the leadership and assistance of local party committees and people's governments in order to run the schools well.

At the opening ceremony, Vice Minister of Higher Education Zeng Zhaolun gave a report on the tasks of higher agricultural and forestry education in the future. His report explained the achievements and shortcomings of agricultural and forestry colleges and universities nationwide in various aspects such as adjusting departments, setting up majors, and reforming teaching since the First National Agricultural College Presidents Conference in July 1952, and put forward future guidelines and tasks for discussion at the conference.

Minister of Forestry Liang Xi also spoke at the meeting. In addition to explaining the basic situation of current forestry production and technical cadres, he also emphasized the importance of training forestry cadres.

More than 150 people attended the conference, including presidents, principals, academic deans, department heads of higher agricultural and forestry colleges and universities across the country, and representatives of relevant agencies.

    第二次高等农林教育会议开幕
    【新华社二十七日讯】中华人民共和国高等教育部、农业部和林业部联合召集的第二次全国高等农林教育会议二十七日在北京开幕。这次会议将根据国家在过渡时期的总任务来确定高等农林教育的方针、任务和培养目标，明确今后如何在现有基础上更好地为农业社会主义改造和发展农业生产服务；研究如何结合中国实际情况进一步全面地学习苏联先进经验，把教学改革稳步向前推进；研究必要的专业设置和调整计划、各校发展规模、师资培养计划和适当解决各校农场、林场、牧场的需要等问题。
    高等教育部部长杨秀峰致开幕词，他要求到会人员注意研究高等农林教育、总结和发扬我国固有的农业生产经验的问题。他说：已有数千年历史的农业生产的经验，是我们民族的宝贵遗产，必须加以总结，对它的科学成就，应在我们高等农林教育中加以发扬和运用。由于我国过去的农林教育受欧美资产阶级思想影响较深，除少数学者重视祖国科学遗产外，绝大多数人是忽视的。直到今天我们仍然没有应有的重视，甚至还有些人对祖国的遗产存在不正确的看法和错误的态度，这次会议应该加以检查和检讨。我们高等农林教育工作者应该以十分严肃的态度，来对待发扬祖国农业科学遗产的问题，使这一工作成为我们教学和科学研究工作中一个严重的任务。关于结合中国实际，全面学习苏联先进教育经验问题，杨秀峰指出，必须以马克思列宁主义思想武器，改进教学内容，培养适合社会主义建设的干部，是教学改革的中心要求。为了达到这个要求，必须在教学组织和教学制度上有相应的改革，以保证教学改革工作的顺利推进。要依据稳步前进的工作方针来工作，适当加快步伐，但不能忘记具体情况，不能要求过急，避免发生忙乱现象。杨秀峰在谈到农林院校的领导关系问题时，强调无论中央直接领导的或是委托省市领导的，都必须进一步依靠各地党委和人民政府的领导和帮助，才能办好学校。
    开幕会上，高等教育部副部长曾昭抡作了关于今后高等农林教育的任务的报告，他的报告对一九五二年七月第一次全国农学院院长会议以来全国农林院校在调整院系、设置专业和教学改革等各方面的成绩和缺点都作了说明，并提出今后的方针任务供会议讨论。
    林业部部长梁希也在会上讲了话。他除说明了当前林业生产和技术干部的基本情况外，并着重指出了培养林业干部的重要性。
    参加这次会议的有全国高等农林院校的院、校长、教务长、系主任和有关机关代表共一百五十多人。
