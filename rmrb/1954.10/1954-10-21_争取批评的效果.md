    Striving for the Effect of Criticism
　  Shi Xin
    To carry out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers is neither a decoration nor empty political talk. Newspaper criticism must be effective. Only when newspaper criticism has practical results can it truly become a weapon for exposing all shortcomings and errors in our work and a driving force for promoting national construction, and can it attract the broad masses to carry out bottom-up criticism more actively. Only in this way can our newspapers be truly combat-effective.
    In recent years, newspapers in various regions have made certain efforts to implement the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, and have achieved certain results. However, many party organizations and party newspapers have not well implemented this Central Committee resolution, and therefore the criticism published in many newspapers is not always effective, or at least many are not very effective. Some criticisms are ineffective because they are incorrect or not correct enough, and even produce bad effects. Some criticisms have no results because they are resisted by those who are criticized. Some criticisms only have results in form, but no practical effect. Some criticisms have great importance and universal educational significance, but fail to achieve widespread and in-depth effects. These situations show that our newspapers still have many shortcomings in striving for the effect of criticism. Newspapers must conscientiously overcome these shortcomings in order to further improve the level of criticism and self-criticism.
    In order to strive for the effect of criticism, newspapers must first ensure the correctness of the criticism. Correctness not only means that the facts being criticized are completely true, but also that the attitude and viewpoint of the criticism must be correct. Only such criticism represents the truth, stands on solid ground, and can achieve the due effect; otherwise, it will not. Anhui Daily sampled 50 readers' letters of criticism published in the third quarter of last year, and found that 10 were completely untrue and 8 were partially untrue. The reader's letter in Sichuan Daily published on May 9 this year criticizing the Shian Township Silkworm Village of Santai County for forcibly apportioning silkworm eggs, the essay "Playing Poker Cannot Hinder Work" published on April 3, and the essay "After the Oil Lamp Goes Out" published on June 3, were completely or fundamentally inconsistent with the facts. This kind of criticism with untrue content has had a very bad impact on practical work and among the broad masses. It can be seen that ensuring the correctness of criticism is the most basic condition for newspaper criticism to achieve practical results. Our newspapers must be good at learning from practical lessons, establish a work style of investigation and research, and establish a strict system of investigation and research to eradicate all erroneous criticisms.
    Newspaper criticism should not only be correct, but should also strive to be profound. That is to say, newspaper criticism cannot stop at listing phenomena, it should strive to explore the key and essence of the problem. Shenyang Daily criticized the Electrician 15 Factory on April 1 and May 18 last year for failing to complete the national plan for a long time. The first criticism did not attract the attention of the masses because the questions raised were disorganized and not prominent. The second criticism, due to more detailed investigation and research, grasped the universal ideological problem that enterprise leaders lacked a serious sense of responsibility for completing the national plan, and more deeply exposed the contradiction that the enterprise management level was lagging behind the requirements of developing production, which is an urgent problem to be solved at present. As a result, it produced a wide range of educational effects, helped the workers of each factory to improve their understanding of completing the national plan, and promoted the planning and management of each factory. This shows that the more profound the newspaper criticism, the more powerful it is, and the better the effect it can produce.
    However, not every healthy criticism can achieve the practical effect of eliminating shortcomings and errors. It should be recognized that criticism and self-criticism is a fierce struggle between new and old ideas, correct and incorrect ideas; the development of criticism and self-criticism is by no means smooth sailing; the principles of criticism and self-criticism are not yet able to function smoothly in all aspects of our party and state organs. In this regard, newspapers will inevitably encounter resistance and difficulties. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out that after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, a very dangerous sense of pride grew among some cadres in the party, who could only listen to flattery and praise, but could not accept criticism and supervision, and suppressed and retaliated against critics. This is the first obstacle that newspapers encounter in carrying out criticism. In addition, some party members and cadres are stained with the dust of bureaucracy, they either ignore criticism, or only accept criticism in words and on paper, but in reality they try their best to bury criticism, which also affects the failure of newspaper criticism to achieve the due effect. In order to strive for the effect of criticism, newspapers must, with a high degree of principle, carry out a firm and unremitting struggle against the phenomena of suppressing criticism, ignoring criticism, and perfunctorily dealing with criticism. Liaoxi Daily published criticism of the conservative thinking of leading cadres of Liaoxi First Machinery Factory last year. This criticism was resisted by Chen Wenxuan, deputy director of the factory, and others, who refused to criticize and insisted that the newspaper's criticism was not in line with the facts. Later, the newspaper conducted further in-depth investigation, proving that the criticism was not untrue, and that the reason why the factory's leading cadres resisted criticism was related to the appeasement of the leaders of the Liaoxi Provincial Department of Industry and the Industry Department of the Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. After obtaining the support of the Provincial Party Committee, the newspaper continued to expose the above facts and mobilized the masses to continue to launch criticism, and finally achieved satisfactory results. Jilin Daily also fought against the leading cadres of the 91 Engineering Company last year who ignored newspaper criticism and responded to newspaper criticism with a perfunctory attitude. This struggle was strongly supported by the vast number of employees of the company and the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and produced a greater and better impact. These two examples show that newspapers must have a fully responsible spirit under the direct leadership of the Party Committee, dare to adhere to the truth, and oppose both the attitude of resisting criticism and the formalistic attitude of dealing with criticism perfunctorily, in order to overcome resistance and difficulties and achieve practical results of criticism. Whether or not to persist in the struggle for the effect of criticism is a test of the party spirit of the newspaper. It is precisely on this issue that most of our newspapers have not always demonstrated their strong party spirit. In this way, the newspaper has not completely fulfilled its task. Obviously, only by overcoming this shortcoming can the newspaper truly play an active role in improving work through criticism.
    In carrying out criticism, as in other aspects, newspapers are not only collective propagandists and collective agitators, but also collective organizers. After the newspaper correctly puts forward criticism, it must not treat the struggle to eliminate shortcomings and errors with the attitude of a third party; it should give play to its initiative and actively participate in the struggle to expand the effect of criticism. This means moving from individual criticism to more widespread and profound criticism, so that criticism becomes a greater force and promotes the progress of work in one aspect. In order to expand the effect of criticism, newspapers must attract and mobilize the masses. A series of criticisms launched by the Northeast Daily on "bureaucratic stores" last year is a good example in this regard. On September 23 last year, the newspaper published a reader's letter criticizing the sales department of the Shenyang Municipal Industrial Bureau Supply and Marketing Department as "a bureaucratic store." Then it received feedback from the masses, saying that stores that adopted bureaucratic business methods similar to those criticized by the newspaper were everywhere, mostly small state-owned stores and cooperatives. In order to practically and effectively solve this problem, which is related to the interests of the broad masses and the interests of state-owned and cooperative commerce itself, the newspaper conducted investigations and research in the Shenyang Municipal Cooperative General Society and a number of grassroots consumer cooperatives and the food department of the Shenyang No. 2 Department Store, to understand the business characteristics of small stores and cooperatives, and to study whether the advanced experience of continuous shift system can be implemented in these units. The results of the investigation proved that the continuous shift system can also be implemented in the cooperative system, but generally it should be done in two steps, that is, first implement the rotation system, and then implement the insertion shift method, and combine these two, which is the continuous shift system. On the one hand, the newspaper successively reflected the calls from the masses in various places to change the bureaucratic stores, in order to promote state-owned stores and cooperatives in various places to actively improve business methods; on the other hand, it attracted activists from the commercial sector to publish opinions on improving business and spread their successful experiences in the newspaper, and reported the gradual promotion of the continuous shift system in the Shenyang cooperative system. As a result, it caused a great response and promoted the rapid promotion of the continuous shift system in the cooperative systems in various places. The practice of Northeast Daily and many newspapers proves that if newspapers are good at playing the role of collective organizers, they can make criticism produce the most widespread social impact, thereby powerfully promoting the struggle to eliminate shortcomings and errors.
    Whether the newspaper can effectively carry out criticism also reflects whether the Party Committee's leadership over the newspaper's criticism work is normal, and reflects whether the party's democratic life is sound. To fight for the practical effect of criticism is not only the responsibility of the newspaper, but also the unshirkable responsibility of the party's leadership organs at all levels. Party committees at all levels have the responsibility to ensure that the criticism in the newspaper receives a real effect, and to constantly educate party members, especially those who are criticized, to adopt a correct attitude towards the criticism in the newspaper. The discipline inspection commissions of the Party Committees at all levels and the supervision departments of the People's Committees at all levels, under the unified leadership of the Party Committees, also have the responsibility to assist the newspapers in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and to ensure its practical effect. The leading organs of the Party at all levels must ensure that the correct criticism published in the newspaper can receive the support of the Party, and resolutely fight against all phenomena that do not welcome criticism, hinder criticism, and retaliate against critics. Only in this way can criticism and self-criticism in newspapers be fully and effectively carried out.

    争取批评的效果
　  湜辛
    在报纸上开展批评和自我批评，既不是一种点缀，也不是政治空谈。报纸的批评一定要有效果。只有报纸的批评是有实际成效的，它才能真正成为揭露我们工作中一切缺点和错误的武器和推进国家建设事业的动力，才能吸引广大群众更积极地进行自下而上的批评。也只有这样，我们的报纸才是真正具有战斗力的。
    几年来，各地报纸对贯彻中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定作了一定的努力，取得了一定的成绩。但是很多党组织和党的机关报对于中央这一决议没有很好地贯彻，因而许多报纸发表的批评并不是经常有成效的，至少有许多是成效不大的。有些批评因为不正确或不够正确，所以达不到成效，甚至产生了不好的效果。有些批评因为受到被批评者的抵抗而没有结果。有些批评只是在形式上有结果，而没有实际的效果。也有些批评具有较大的重要性和普遍的教育意义，但是未能取得广泛和深入的效果。这些情况说明了我们的报纸在争取批评的效果方面还存在着不少缺点。报纸只有认真地克服这些缺点，才能进一步提高批评和自我批评的水平。
    为要争取批评的效果，报纸必须首先保证批评的正确性。所谓正确，不仅是指所批评的事实完全真实，而且是指批评的态度和观点必须正确。只有这样的批评才代表真理，才站得住脚，才能收到应有的效果；反之则否。安徽日报抽查了去年第三季度发表的五十件读者批评信件，已证明完全失实的就有十件，部分失实的有八件。四川日报今年五月九日发表的批评三台县石安乡蚕庄强迫摊派蚕种的读者来信，四月三日发表的小品文“玩扑克牌不能妨碍工作”，以及六月三日发表的小品文“油灯熄灭之后”，则与事实完全不符或基本不符。这种内容失实的批评，在实际工作和广大群众中造成了很坏的影响。由此可见保证批评的正确性，是报纸的批评能够收到实际成效的最起码的条件。我们的报纸必须善于从实践的教训中进行学习，树立调查研究的作风，建立严格的调查研究制度，来根绝一切错误的批评。
    报纸的批评不仅应该做到正确，而且应该力求深刻。这就是说，报纸的批评不能停留于现象罗列，它应该力求发掘问题的关键和本质。沈阳日报曾在去年四月一日和五月十八日对电工十五厂长期不能完成国家计划提出批评。第一次的批评由于问题提得凌乱而不突出，没有引起群众的重视。第二次的批评，由于进行了比较细致的调查研究，抓住了企业领导干部对于完成国家计划缺乏严肃的责任感这一带普遍性的思想问题，比较深入地揭露了企业管理水平落后于发展生产的要求这一当前亟待解决的矛盾，结果产生了广泛的教育作用，有助于各厂职工提高对完成国家计划的认识，并推动了各厂的计划管理工作。这说明了，报纸的批评越是深刻，就越有力量，也就越能产生好的效果。
    但是并不是每一个健康的批评，都能得到消除缺点和错误的实际效果。应该认识，批评和自我批评是新思想和旧思想、正确的思想和不正确的思想之间的剧烈斗争；批评和自我批评的开展绝不是一帆风顺的；批评和自我批评的原则在我们党内和国家机构内，还不是在所有的环节都能畅行无阻的。在这方面，报纸必然会遇到阻力和困难。党的七届四中全会指出，在新民主主义革命胜利以后，党内一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，他们只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，对批评者实行压制和报复。这就是报纸在开展批评中首先遇到的障碍。此外，某些党员和干部沾染了官僚主义的灰尘，他们或者对批评不加理睬，或者仅仅在口头上和纸面上接受批评，而在实际上却竭力埋葬批评，这也影响了报纸的批评不能收到应有的成效。为要争取批评的效果，报纸就必须以高度的原则精神，向压制批评、漠视批评和敷衍批评的现象进行坚决的不懈的斗争。辽西日报去年曾发表对辽西第一机械厂领导干部保守思想的批评。这个批评受到了该厂副厂长陈文轩等人的骄傲情绪的抵抗，他们拒绝批评，硬说报纸的批评不符事实。后来报纸进一步深入调查，证明批评并无失实之处，而该厂领导干部所以抗拒批评，则与辽西省工业厅和中共锦州市委工业部领导方面的姑息情绪有关。报纸在取得省委的支持后，继续揭露了上述事实，并发动群众继续展开批评，终于得到了完满的结果。吉林日报去年也曾对漠视报纸批评和以敷衍塞责态度答复报纸批评的九一工程公司领导干部进行了斗争。这一斗争得到了该公司广大职工和中共吉林市委的有力支持，产生了较大较好的影响。这两个例子表明，报纸必须在党委的直接领导下，具有充分负责的精神，勇于坚持真理，既要反对抗拒批评的态度，又要反对敷衍塞责的形式主义的对待批评的态度，才能克服阻力和困难，取得批评的实际成效。能否为批评的效果而坚持斗争，这是报纸的党性的考验。正是在这个问题上，我们的多数报纸并没有经常表现出自己的坚强党性。这样，报纸就没有彻底完成自己的任务。显然，报纸只有克服这个缺点，才能使批评真正起到改进工作的积极作用。
    在开展批评方面，也和在其他方面一样，报纸不仅是集体的宣传者和集体的鼓动者，而且是集体的组织者。报纸在正确地提出了批评以后，绝不能以第三者的态度对待消除缺点和错误的斗争；它应该发挥主动性，积极地参加到斗争中去，力求扩大批评的效果。这就是要从个别的批评进到更广泛更深刻的批评，从而使得批评成为更巨大的力量，推动某一方面的工作前进。为了扩大批评的效果，报纸必须吸引和发动群众。东北日报去年对“机关式商店”所开展的一系列的批评，就是这方面的一个较好的例子。去年九月二十三日，该报发表了一件批评沈阳市工业局供销处门市部是“一座机关式的商店”的读者来信。接着就收到群众的反应，说类似报纸所批评的采取机关式营业方法的商店到处都有，其中以小型的国营商店和合作社为多。该报为了实际而有效地解决这一关系到广大群众利益和国营及合作社商业本身利益的问题，就在沈阳市合作总社和若干基层消费合作社以及沈阳市第二百货商店食品部作了调查研究，了解小型商店和合作社的营业特点，研究连带上班制的先进经验在这些单位是否可以实行。调查结果证明，在合作社系统也可以实行连带上班制，但一般地要分两步走，即首先实行轮休制，而后实行插班作业法，把这两者结合起来，就是连带上班制。该报一方面陆续地反映了各地群众要求改变机关式商店的呼声，以推动各地国营商店和合作社积极改善营业方法；另一方面吸引商业部门的积极分子在报上发表改进业务的意见并传播自己的成功经验，同时报道了沈阳市合作社逐步推行连带上班制的情况，结果引起了很大的反响，促进了连带上班制在各地合作社系统的迅速推广。东北日报和许多报纸的实践证明，报纸如果善于发挥集体组织者的作用，就能使批评产生最广泛的社会影响，从而有力地推动消除缺点和错误的斗争。
    报纸是否能有成效地开展批评，也反映着党委对报纸批评工作的领导是否正常，反映着党的民主生活是否健全。为批评的实际效果而斗争，不仅是报纸的责任，而且是党的各级领导机关的不可推诿的责任。各级党委有责任使报纸的批评收到确实的效果，经常教育党员特别是被批评者对报纸上的批评采取正确态度。各级党委的纪律检查委员会和各级人民委员会的监察部门，在党委的统一领导下，也有责任协助报纸开展批评和自我批评，并保证它的实际效果。党的各级领导机关必须保证报纸上发表的正确的批评能够得到党的支持，并和一切不欢迎批评、阻碍批评和对批评者实行打击报复的现象进行坚决的斗争。只有这样，报纸上的批评和自我批评才能充分而有效地开展起来。
