(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd) The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on October 21st at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting, the senior member of the Korean-Chinese side, General Li Sang-cho, lodged a serious protest with the US side regarding the serious violations of the armistice agreement on October 11th, when US armed forces invaded the Korean-Chinese side's Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), killing, wounding, and abducting Korean-Chinese civil police, and when US armed forces entered the US side's DMZ carrying heavy weapons. He demanded that the US side immediately return Kim In-hwan, the Korean-Chinese civil policeman abducted by the US side, to the Korean-Chinese side. General Li Sang-cho also suggested that the Military Armistice Commission make a joint request to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) to dispatch mobile neutral nations inspection teams to investigate the repeated incidents of the US side dispatching armed personnel to conduct hostile acts against the Korean-Chinese side, in violation of the armistice agreement.

    The October 11th incident occurred at 5:40 AM. After invading the Korean-Chinese side's DMZ near Dousu-ri, US armed forces ambushed Korean-Chinese civil police on patrol, killing Korean-Chinese civil policeman Li Zhi-san, and wounding and abducting Korean-Chinese civil policeman Kim In-hwan. Following this incident, US armed forces were discovered to have illegally entered the US side's DMZ near the scene of the incident carrying heavy weapons. On October 12th, members of both sides of the Fourth Joint Observer Team conducted a joint investigation of the incident. The investigation results confirmed in many ways the facts of the US armed forces killing, wounding, and abducting Korean-Chinese civil police.

    At the meeting, General Li Sang-cho rebuked the US side, saying, "This is another serious provocative act by your side in dispatching armed personnel to attack our civil police." General Li Sang-cho emphasized, "I lodge a serious protest with your side regarding this serious violation of the armistice agreement. I demand that your side immediately return our wounded and abducted civil policeman Kim In-hwan, take strict disciplinary measures against the relevant personnel on your side who dispatched armed personnel to conduct hostile acts against our side, and guarantee that such provocative incidents will not occur again in the future."

    Because the US side still adopted a denying attitude towards this incident at the meeting and refused to return the Korean-Chinese civil policeman, General Li Sang-cho suggested at the meeting that the Military Armistice Commission make a joint request to the NNSC to dispatch mobile teams to locations outside the DMZ to investigate the incidents of the US side dispatching armed personnel to conduct hostile acts against the Korean-Chinese side, in violation of the armistice agreement. General Li Sang-cho said at the meeting:
    "Although the locations of the hostile acts carried out by your armed personnel on October 11th and August 30th are within the DMZ, the dispatch of armed personnel to conduct hostile activities itself constitutes a violation of the armistice agreement. Investigation of this outside the DMZ is the responsibility of the mobile neutral nations inspection teams."

    The senior member of the United Nations Command (UNC) side, Britton, did not give serious consideration to the just suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, and groundlessly slandered the NNSC at the meeting, unreasonably rejecting the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side.

    General Li Sang-cho then declared at the meeting: The Korean-Chinese side will, in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement, independently submit a request to the NNSC to dispatch mobile teams to investigate the US side's violations of the armistice agreement.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd) After the UNC side refused to jointly request the NNSC to investigate the UNC side's violations of the armistice agreement, the senior member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, General Li Sang-cho, sent a letter to the NNSC on October 21st, requesting it to dispatch three mobile neutral nations inspection teams to locations outside the DMZ to conduct special observation and inspection of the UNC side's violations of the armistice agreement by dispatching armed personnel to conduct hostile acts against the Korean-Chinese side.

    In his letter, General Li Sang-cho pointed out: On October 11, 1954, the armed forces of the "Republic of Korea" under the command of the UNC side, located approximately one kilometer southwest of Tori-dong and Chigeun-dong, dispatched armed teams to invade the DMZ under our jurisdiction, ambushing our civil police, killing our civil policeman Li Zhi-san, and wounding and abducting our civil policeman Kim In-hwan.

    On August 30, 1954, the US Eighth Army Intelligence Corps 8097 BMC unit under the command of the UNC side, located approximately 2.5 kilometers southwest of Inje, dispatched armed personnel Fang Ji-ho, Fang In-chan, and Li Seung-bok to invade the DMZ under our jurisdiction to conduct hostile acts. All three of these armed personnel from the UNC side were captured by our civil police.

    General Li Sang-cho said: Joint observer teams of the Military Armistice Commission have investigated the parts of the above two incidents that occurred within the DMZ. However, the UNC side has disregarded irrefutable testimonial and material evidence, denying serious responsibility for the above incidents. The UNC side has even counter-accused the Korean-Chinese side of violating the armistice agreement, deliberately staging these incidents, and has so far refused to return our civil policeman Kim In-hwan.

    Therefore, General Li Sang-cho made the following requests to the NNSC:

    1. Request the NNSC to immediately dispatch a mobile neutral nations inspection team to the location approximately one kilometer southwest of Tori-dong and Chigeun-dong within the military control area of the UNC side to investigate the UNC side's violation of the armistice agreement by dispatching its armed teams to kill, abduct, and detain our civil police in the aforementioned October 11, 1954, incident.

    2. Request the NNSC to immediately dispatch a mobile neutral nations inspection team to the location approximately 2.5 kilometers southwest of Inje within the military control area of the UNC side to investigate the UNC side's violation of the armistice agreement by dispatching its armed personnel to conduct hostile acts against our side in the aforementioned August 30, 1954, incident.

    3. In view of the fact that at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 6, 1954, regarding the August 30, 1954, incident, the UNC side not only flatly denied it but also falsely accused the three armed personnel of the UNC side captured by our side of being our own personnel, staged by our side, therefore, request the NNSC to immediately dispatch a mobile neutral nations inspection team to Kaesong within our military control area to question the three armed military personnel of the UNC side captured by our side, as well as other relevant witnesses.

    关于最近连续发生的美方违反停战协定的事件
    朝中方面要求中立国监察委员会派员调查
    【新华社开城二十二日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会在朝中方面的建议下于十月二十一日举行会议。朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会上就十月十一日美方武装部队侵入朝中方面非军事区杀害、打伤和劫走朝中方面民政警察，和美方武装部队携带重武器进入美方非军事区的严重违反停战协定的事件，向美方提出严重抗议，并要求美方立即将被美方劫走的朝中方面民政警察金仁焕交还朝中方面。李相朝将军并建议军事停战委员会向中立国监察委员会提出共同的要求，即：派机动中立国视察小组，对连续发生的美方派遣武装人员向朝中方面进行敌对行为的违反停战协定的事件，进行调查。
    十月十一日的事件发生在早晨五时四十分，美方武装部队在侵入朝中方面非军事区后于豆粟洞附近伏击执行巡逻任务的朝中方面民政警察，杀害了朝中方面民政警察李治三，并打伤和劫走了朝中方面民政警察金仁焕。这一事件发生后，并曾发现美方武装部队携带重武器非法进入了上述事件发生地点附近的美方非军事区。十月十二日第四联合观察小组的双方成员对此事件进行了共同调查，调查结果多方面地证实了美方武装部队杀害、打伤和劫走朝中方面民政警察的事实。
    李相朝将军在会上指责美方说：“这是你方又一次派遣武装人员袭击我方民政警察的严重挑衅行为。”李相朝将军强调说：“对你方这一严重违反停战协定的行为，我向你方提出严重抗议。我要求你方立即送回被打伤和劫走的我方民政警察金仁焕，对派遣武装人员向我方进行敌对行为的你方有关人员采取严格的纪律措施，并保证今后不再发生这种挑衅事件。”
    由于美方在会议上对这次事件仍然采取抵赖的态度，并拒绝归还朝中方面民政警察，李相朝将军在会上建议军事停战委员会向中立国监察委员会提出共同要求，即：派遣机动小组到非军事区以外的地点，调查美方派遣武装人员向朝中方面进行敌对行为的违反停战协定的事件。李相朝将军在会上说：
  “十月十一日和八月三十日你方武装人员进行敌对行为的地点，虽然在非军事区以内，但是派遣武装人员进行敌对活动本身就构成了对于停战协定的违反，而在非军事区以外对此进行调查乃是机动中立国视察小组的职司。”
    联合国军方面首席委员布里敦对朝中方面的正当的建议并未作认真的考虑，并在会上别有用心地诬蔑中立国监察委员会，无理地拒绝了朝中方面的建议。
    李相朝将军即在会上声明：朝中方面将根据停战协定的规定，单独向中立国监察委员会提出派遣机动小组调查美方违反停战协定事件的要求。
    【新华社开城二十二日电】在联合国军方面拒绝共同要求中立国监察委员会调查对联合国军方面违反停战协定的事件之后，朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将于十月二十一日致函中立国监察委员会，请求它派遣三个机动中立国视察小组到非军事区以外的地点，对联合国军方面违反停战协定派遣武装人员向朝中方面进行敌对行为的事件进行特别观察与视察。
    李相朝中将在信中指出：一九五四年十月十一日，联合国军方面位于桃李洞和赤根洞南偏西约一公里处的“大韩民国”武装部队，派遣武装队伍侵入我方管辖下的非军事区伏击我方民政警察，杀害我方民警李治三，并打伤和劫走我方民警金仁焕。
  一九五四年八月三十日，联合国军方面位于麟蹄西南约二公里半处的美军第八军情报处8097BMC部队派遣武装人员方基镐、方仁赞、李承福三人侵入我方管辖下的非军事区进行敌对行为。这三名联合国军方面的武装人员全部为我方民政警察所捕获。
    李相朝中将说：以上两项事件，有关非军事区内的部分都曾由军事停战委员会联合观察小组进行过调查。但是联合国军方面无视无可否认的人证和物证，抵赖对于以上事件的严重责任。联合国军方面甚至于反诬朝中方面违反停战协定，有意布置这种事件，并至今拒绝交还我方民政警察金仁焕。
    因此，李相朝中将向中立国监察委员会提出如下的请求：
    一、请求中立国监察委员会立即派遣一个机动中立国视察小组至联合国军方面军事控制地区内的桃李洞和赤根洞南偏西约一公里处对联合国军方面在上述一九五四年十月十一日事件中派遣其武装队伍杀害、劫走和扣押我方民政警察的违反停战协定的事件进行调查。
    二、请求中立国监察委员会立即派遣一个机动中立国视察小组前往联合国军方面军事控制地区内的麟蹄西南约二公里半处，对联合国军方面在上述
  一九五四年八月三十日事件中派遣其武装人员向我方进行敌对行为的违反停战协定的事件进行调查。
    三、鉴于联合国军方面在一九五四年十月六日军事停战委员会对一九五四年八月三十日事件不仅矢口抵赖，而且诬控我方捕获的三名联合国军方面武装人员是我方人员，是我方所布置的，因此请求中立国监察委员会立即派遣一个机动中立国视察小组前往我方军事控制地区开城讯问为我方捕获的三名联合国军方面武装军事人员以及其他有关证人。
