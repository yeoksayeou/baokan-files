Vigorously Promote the Planned Supply of Cotton Cloth in Rural Areas
Zhou Jun

Since the implementation of planned cotton cloth supply in urban and rural areas across the country, the market has stabilized, and the people have supported it. The planned cotton cloth supply work has had a good start. However, some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives have insufficient understanding of the significant responsibility they bear in implementing the policy of planned cotton cloth supply, and the complexity and arduousness of implementing the planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth in rural areas. Some believe that the implementation of planned cotton cloth supply has added trouble to their work; others believe that “everything is fine” after the rationing coupons are issued. This kind of thinking is extremely wrong. Planned cotton cloth supply is an extremely complex and meticulous economic and political task. The planned cotton cloth supply work in rural areas is even more complex and difficult than in cities. Cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives should fully recognize this point. In order to do a good job in the planned supply of cotton cloth, the following points should be noted at present:

1.  Conscientiously study the policies of planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth, and planned purchase of cotton, and explain the policies and specific measures and procedures related to the planned supply of cotton cloth to the masses in connection with the business of the supply and marketing cooperatives. This should become a regular task for the salespersons of the supply and marketing cooperatives. At present, many people in rural areas still have some concerns about the planned supply of cotton cloth; some people do not know how to use the cloth coupons after receiving them. This requires cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives to carefully address the concerns of consumers in connection with the planned cotton cloth supply business, and to explain to them so that consumers recognize that planned purchase and planned supply are an important part of the general task of the transition period, and to turn this planned and rational distribution method into a habit of the vast number of consumers. Only in this way can the policy of planned cotton cloth supply be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, stabilize emotions, and facilitate the implementation of the policy of planned cotton cloth supply.

2.  We must strengthen the arrangement of rural cotton cloth retailers. Rural cotton cloth retailers have a certain connection with rural consumption, concentrate funds, and have a large turnover. At present, there are about hundreds of thousands of people engaged in rural cotton cloth retail business in the country. As long as we strictly limit the speculative side of rural cotton cloth retailers, they still play a certain role in supplying the needs of the vast number of farmers. Therefore, we must resolutely implement the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of rural cotton cloth retailers, and make proper arrangements for them. In addition to those who can be organized to switch to other occupations, the general ones should be maintained to continue to serve the farmers, which is beneficial to activating the urban and rural economy. It is inappropriate to simply squeeze them out or prematurely make them switch to other occupations without certainty. For example, after the planned supply of cotton cloth began in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, it was planned to transfer all retail cloth merchants to agriculture, but each person had an average of only one mu of land, and some even less than one mu. It would be difficult to maintain their lives after the transfer, which would bring difficulties to the country. Therefore, after the implementation of planned cotton cloth supply in various places, we should first maintain the cotton cloth retailers as much as possible, and then gradually change them into various forms of state capitalist commerce according to the situation and different conditions in various places. For surplus cloth merchants, we can guide them to transfer to agriculture, handicrafts, or transportation according to the actual conditions, but we must prevent blind and chaotic transfers and overcome impatience, so as to avoid unemployment and confusion. This is being responsible for the supply in rural areas. Rural supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should conscientiously implement this measure.

3.  Strengthen investigation and research to ensure the basic needs of the vast number of farmers. After the planned supply of cotton cloth, due to the change from the past free trading to supply according to planned allocation, management departments are prone to bureaucratism and commandism, ignoring the demands of consumers, relaxing investigation and research on the needs of farmers, and not organizing sources of goods and improving production according to the needs of farmers. For example, some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives in Northeast China believe that the cotton cloth supply work will be easier in the future, and there is no need to investigate the needs of the people or make plans anymore. They can sell whatever they have, and people can buy it or not. These views are all wrong. In addition, some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas are unwilling to actively purchase goods. All these ideas are extremely irresponsible to the country and consumers. If they are not prevented in time, they will inevitably seriously affect the supply to the masses. Cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives must recognize that after the planned supply of cotton cloth, meeting the demands and preferences of the people in terms of variety and color is of particular importance. Therefore, we must strengthen investigation and research, organize sources of goods according to the needs of farmers, and meet the basic needs of the people to the greatest extent possible within our capacity. This is both responsible to the masses and can avoid the losses caused by blind purchasing.

4.  Strengthen the responsibility of salespersons, improve work efficiency, and improve service attitude. After the planned supply of cotton cloth, the responsibility of rural supply and marketing cooperatives is even greater. If the service is inadequate, the work attitude is not good, and the procedures are too complicated, it will cause farmers to misunderstand the government's policy of planned cotton cloth supply. This is an irresponsible performance to the country and the people. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must strengthen the political education of salespersons, educate them to further improve service attitude, improve labor organization, simplify procedures, and improve work efficiency in order to facilitate the purchase of the masses in order to do a good job in the planned supply of cotton cloth. After the planned supply of cotton cloth, the Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative formulated measures such as the sales, ticket collection, ticket sorting, and fabric conversion table to improve work efficiency and speed up the sale of cloth. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places can refer to this method and further simplify the sales procedures and improve work efficiency in conjunction with the specific conditions of the local area to ensure the smooth progress of the planned cotton cloth supply work. Any retreat in the face of difficulties, adherence to conventions, or reduction of turnover is an irresponsible performance to the masses, which must be opposed.

In addition, in order to facilitate farmers' purchases and timely supply of cloth to farmers, reasonable arrangements should be made for cotton cloth supply points. An accurate calculation should be made for the original grassroots cooperatives, branches, stores, distribution points, stalls, and the population of villages within the scope of this business, so that the distance of the area, the amount of sales, and the number of salespersons are properly arranged. At the same time, supplies can also be organized in the form of temple fairs, small exchange meetings, etc.; or cotton cloth merchants and peddlers can be organized to delineate the scope and supply with certificates. However, supervision and education of cotton cloth merchants must be strengthened, necessary and feasible management methods should be stipulated, and special personnel or certain organizations should be designated to conduct regular patrols and inspections to prevent acts of deceiving farmers such as using small rulers to charge high prices. In short, the planned supply of cotton cloth is a new, arduous, and complex task. We still lack experience in this area. Therefore, state-owned companies and cooperatives in various places must closely cooperate, divide responsibilities, and work together to do a good job in the planned supply of cotton cloth under the unified leadership of the Party and government.

    大力推进农村中的棉布计划供应工作
    周钧
    全国大小城镇和农村，实行棉布计划供应后，市场稳定，人民群众拥护，棉布计划供应工作已有了一个良好的开端。但目前有些供销合作社干部对自己在贯彻棉布计划供应政策中所担负的重大责任，和在农村中实行棉布计划收购计划供应工作的复杂性、艰巨性认识不足。有的认为实行棉布计划供应给自己的工作添了麻烦；有的认为凭票供应后就“万事大吉”了，这种想法是极其错误的。棉布计划供应是一项极其复杂、细致的经济工作和政治工作，农村的棉布计划供应工作比之城市则又复杂和困难得多，供销合作社干部应该充分认识到这一点。为了做好棉布计划供应工作，目前应注意以下几点：
    一、认真学习棉布计划收购计划供应和棉花计划收购的政策，结合供销合作社的业务，向群众解释政策及有关棉布计划供应的各项具体办法和手续，这应当成为供销合作社的营业员一项经常的工作。目前在农村中，还有不少的人对棉布计划供应存在一些顾虑；还有些人领到布票后不知道如何使用。这就需要供销合作社干部结合棉布计划供应的业务工作，很好地针对消费者的顾虑，进行解释，使消费者认清计划收购与计划供应是过渡时期总任务的一个重要组成部分，把这种有计划地合理分配的办法变成广大消费者的一种习惯。只有这样，棉布计划供应政策才能深入人心，安定情绪，有利于棉布计划供应政策的贯彻执行。
    二、必须加强对农村棉布零售商的安排工作。农村棉布零售商与农村的消费有着一定联系，资金集中，营业额较大，目前全国农村棉布零售商从业人员约有几十万人，只要严格限制农村棉布零售商人投机的一面，他们在供应广大农民的需要上还有着一定的作用，因此，对农村棉布零售商必须坚决贯彻利用、限制、改造的政策，予以妥善的安排。除可能组织转业者外，一般的应维持下来使其继续为农民服务，这对活跃城乡经济是有好处的。如果单纯地挤掉或无把握的过多过早的使其转业，是不适当的。如河北省藁城县在棉布计划供应开始后，计划将零售布商全部转向农业，但每人平均只有一亩多土地，甚至有的还不足一亩，转业后生活将难以维持，反而给国家带来困难。因此，各地在棉布计划供应实行后，首先应尽可能地将棉布零售商维持下来，然后根据情况和各地不同的条件，逐步地把它们改变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义商业。对多余的布商可根据实际条件辅导其转入农业、手工业或运输业，但必须防止盲目乱转和克服急躁情绪，以免造成失业和混乱的现象。这才是对农村的供应负责。各地农村供销合作社应认真贯彻这项措施。
    三、加强调查研究，保证广大农民的基本需要。棉布计划供应后，由于改变了过去的自由买卖为按计划分配的方式供应，经营部门很容易产生官僚主义和强迫命令的现象，忽视消费者的要求，放松调查研究农民需要，不根据农民的需要组织货源，改进生产。如东北有的供销合作社干部就认为今后棉布供应工作好做了，再也不用调查人民需要了，也不用作计划了，有啥卖啥，爱买不买。这些看法都是错误的。另外有的地区的供销合作社干部则不愿积极进货。所有这些思想，都是对国家和对消费者极不负责的态度，如不及时防止，势必严重影响对群众的供应。供销合作社干部必须认识棉布计划供应后，从品种花色上来满足人民的要求和喜好更有其特殊重要的意义，因此，必须加强调查研究工作，根据农民需要组织货源，在可能范围内，最大限度地满足人民的基本需要。这既是对群众负责，又可避免盲目进货所造成的损失。
    四、加强售货员的责任心，提高工作效率，改善服务态度。棉布计划供应以后，农村供销合作社的责任更加重大，如果服务不周，工作态度不好，手续过繁，就会引起农民对政府棉布计划供应政策的误解。这是对国家对人民不负责任的表现。因此，各地供销合作社必须加强对售货员的政治教育，教育他们为作好棉布计划供应工作而进一步改善服务态度，改善劳动组织，简化手续，提高工作效率，以便利群众购买。辽宁省供销合作社在棉布计划供应后，为了提高工作效率，加速卖布速度，制定了卖货、收票、整理票和布制品换算表等办法，各地供销合作社均可参考这种办法，并结合本地具体情况，进一步简化卖货手续，提高工作效率，以保证棉布计划供应工作的顺利进行。任何畏难而退、墨守成规、缩小营业额等等，都是对群众不负责任的表现，是必须反对的。
    此外，为了方便农民购买和及时供应农民用布，对棉布供应点应作合理的安排，将原有的基层社、分社、门市部、分销处、货摊和本业务范围内村庄人口作一精确计算，使地区远近、售货量多少、售货员多少等安排得当；同时，还可利用庙会、小型交流会等形式组织供应；或组织棉布商、货郎担划定范围，流动凭证供应。但对棉布商必须加强监督教育，规定必要可行的管理办法，指定专人或一定的组织经常巡回检查，防止小尺大价等欺骗农民的行为。总之，棉布计划供应是一项新的、艰巨的和复杂的工作，我们在这方面还缺乏经验，因此，各地国营公司、合作社必须在党政的统一领导下，密切合作，分工负责，为作好棉布计划供应工作而共同努力。
