    【Our Newspaper News】Some state-owned and local state-owned enterprises in Shandong, Hunan, Zhejiang and other places are working hard to strengthen labor discipline education for employees, and overcome some of the current lax labor discipline phenomena in enterprises.
    In strengthening labor discipline, all localities have mainly adopted ideological education methods. Many factories and mines in Hunan used propaganda tools such as broadcasting, newsletters, and blackboards to carry out in-depth propaganda on labor discipline. Hunan No. 1 Textile Factory and other factories also held anti-waste exhibitions, using various specific facts to illustrate the losses caused to the country by violations of labor discipline. Before carrying out education, state-owned Qingdao No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory and other enterprises first conducted a detailed investigation of employees' violations of labor discipline, analyzed and studied them, and then carried out publicity according to different types, using detailed accounting methods to explain the harm of violating labor discipline. Enterprise leaders also examined the lack of labor discipline education and some shortcomings in administrative work. Many units also adopted the method of commending advanced figures, calling on everyone to learn from employees who abide by labor discipline. Huainan Coal Mine Construction Company held a selection of labor discipline models during the labor discipline education, and selected 83 first-class models and more than 190 other outstanding figures. When Shenyang Smelter organized employees to study the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises," it commended Zhao Baifu, Zhang Chengliang, Wang Zhong and other advanced figures who have always abided by labor discipline, disseminated their advanced ideas and advanced deeds, and carried out ideological education for employees, so that employees received a profound education. In the past, individual workers who often absented themselves from work examined their mistakes at group meetings. The repair workshop, which originally had lax labor discipline, has now basically eliminated phenomena such as being late, leaving early, and fighting during working hours.
    In carrying out labor discipline education, enterprises in various places attach special importance to education on compliance with operating procedures and safety regulations. After Qingdao City carried out labor discipline education in most factories and enterprises last year, phenomena such as employees being late, leaving early, and absenteeism have improved, but violations of operating procedures are still very serious. According to the statistics of Qingdao Machinery General Factory No. 1, 2 and 3 branches, which are locally state-owned, there were 274 waste product accidents caused by employees' non-compliance with operating procedures in June and July of this year. Therefore, special attention was paid to this aspect in this labor discipline education. In the past, State-owned Zhejiang Flax Mill had many production accidents. For example, in the second half of last year, a total of 296 accidents occurred, which not only caused serious losses to state property, but also brought physical pain to workers. One of the main reasons for the accidents was violation of operating procedures and safety regulations. Not long ago, this factory focused on conducting an education on strictly abiding by operating procedures, using vivid examples to educate workers on the importance of abiding by regulations, and explaining the basic knowledge of relevant operating procedures to workers. After the education, accidents gradually decreased.
    In strengthening labor discipline education, some enterprises have seriously dealt with individual elements who seriously violated labor discipline and refused to correct their mistakes after repeated education in accordance with the law. For example, Zhu Shizhong, a worker at the locally state-owned Hunan Pharmaceutical Factory, came from a capitalist and landlord family and had served in the reactionary army for more than four years, and had very serious hooligan habits. Since he entered the factory as a tableting worker, he was often late, left early, was absent from work, and was lazy. He often pretended to be sick and forced the doctor in the medical office to write him false certificates. Factory leaders and other workers had continuously educated him, but he was scolded instead. Later, he deliberately damaged the machine. Once, he loosened the tension adjuster on the tableting machine, causing the pressed tablets to be unqualified and unable to be packaged, resulting in more than 200,000 tablets being reworked. When washing ampoules (bottles for holding injectable drugs), he deliberately broke the ampoules. When doing cleaning work, he deliberately broke the glass windows. And he swindled outside, owing debts everywhere, and lived a corrupt life. Zhu Shizhong's behavior of undermining labor discipline aroused the indignation of all the workers in the factory, and many workers demanded that this "scourge" be eliminated. Now the Hunan Pharmaceutical Factory has expelled Zhu Shizhong from the factory, and the trade union has also expelled him from membership. The Changsha People's Court sentenced him to one year and six months in prison. Some basic construction departments also dealt with individual employees who seriously violated labor discipline. Lin Junfu, a technician of the No. 1 Construction Engineering Company directly under North China, was seriously irresponsible in his work. He repeatedly and deliberately failed to construct according to the drawings, causing rework and waste of the project and affecting the quality of the project. Although he was repeatedly educated by the leadership, he did not repent at all. Now, with the approval of the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, he has been arrested and it has been decided to prosecute him to the Beijing Municipal People's Court. The General Branch Committee of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant of the Communist Party of China and the administrative department of the power plant have recently also seriously dealt with the incident of Li Shou'an, a worker and Communist Party member of the power plant, who undermined labor discipline. When Li Shou'an was the grinder operator in the boiler workshop, he was irresponsible in his work and violated operating procedures, causing damage to the grinder wheel worth 170 million yuan, and afterwards concealed the accident and threatened workers not to reveal the truth. In May of this year, Li Shou'an violated operating procedures again in order to fraudulently obtain the honor of a new grinder record, damaging machine equipment, and as a result, he was finally stopped and exposed by his assistant Cao Jinsheng. Now, with the approval of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shijingshan Power Plant Party organization has expelled Li Shou'an from the party. The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate has approved the arrest of Li Shou'an and decided to file a public prosecution with the Municipal People's Court.
    The severe handling of those who seriously violate labor discipline has won the heartfelt support and welcome of the majority of employees. Employees have earnestly discussed these events. Many employees said that they must better abide by labor discipline and do a good job in production. After the State-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory convened an employee meeting to announce the expulsion of Ma Cang and Xiao Zhenzhou, workers who seriously undermined labor discipline and refused to mend their ways after repeated education, workers widely discussed the matter, and combined the good deeds and bad deeds of each workshop to carry out commendation and criticism, and the work attitude of many workers has changed. After inspecting and correcting the errors of violating operating procedures in the past, Li Shuzhen, a female worker in the first workshop, conscientiously abided by operating procedures, and her output increased by four or five pounds the next day. Zhai Yuming, a worker who often absented himself from work in the past, now enters the factory early to do handover work. Bi Yuanxiang, a worker in the weaving workshop of the State-owned Qingdao No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory, used to not implement the weaving work method, and reduced the number of looms watched from twenty-four to only sixteen, and often failed to complete the plan. After receiving education, he conscientiously implemented the weaving work method, increased the number of looms watched to twenty-eight, and was able to complete the plan. After many factories conducted discipline education, the situation of lax labor discipline has been greatly improved, and the production enthusiasm of employees has also been improved.

    山东、湖南、浙江等地某些国营工矿企业
    加强对职工的劳动纪律教育
   【本报讯】山东、湖南、浙江等地的某些国营和地方国营企业，努力加强对职工的劳动纪律教育，克服目前企业中某些劳动纪律松弛的现象。
    各地在加强劳动纪律的工作中，主要采取了思想教育的方法。湖南的许多厂矿运用了广播、小报、黑板报等宣传工具，深入开展关于劳动纪律的宣传工作。湖南第一纺织厂等并举办了反浪费展览会，用各种具体事实说明违反劳动纪律给国家造成的损失。国营青岛第二棉纺织厂等企业在进行教育前，首先详细地调查了职工中违反劳动纪律的情况，进行分析研究，然后按照不同类型展开宣传，用算细账的方法说明违反劳动纪律的危害性。企业领导方面也检查了劳动纪律教育不够和行政工作上的一些缺点。许多单位并采取了表扬先进人物的方法，号召大家向遵守劳动纪律的职工学习。淮南煤矿建井公司在进行劳动纪律教育中举行了劳动纪律模范的评选，共评出了甲等模范八十三人，和其他优秀人物一百九十多人。沈阳冶炼厂在组织职工学习
  “国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”时，表扬了一贯遵守劳动纪律的先进人物赵柏福、张成良、王忠等，传播他们的先进思想和先进事迹，向职工进行思想教育，使职工们受到了深刻的教育。过去个别经常旷工的工人在小组会上检讨了自己的错误。原来劳动纪律较松懈的修理车间，现已基本上消灭了迟到、早退、工作时间打闹等现象。
    各地企业在进行劳动纪律教育中，特别重视遵守操作规程和安全规程的教育。青岛市大部分工厂企业在去年进行过劳动纪律教育后，职工中迟到、早退、旷工现象都有所改善，但在违反操作规程方面还很严重，根据地方国营青岛机械总厂一、二、三分厂的统计，今年六、七两月份因职工不遵守操作规程造成的废品事故，就有二百七十四件。因此在这次进行劳动纪律教育中特别注意了这一方面。国营浙江麻纺厂过去各种生产事故很多，如去年下半年共发生事故二百九十六件，不但使国家财产遭受严重损失，也给工人带来了肉体上的痛苦；而造成事故的主要原因之一是违反操作规程和安全规程。不久以前，这个工厂着重地进行了一次关于严格遵守操作规程的教育，运用活人活事教育工人了解遵守规程的重要性，并向工人讲解有关操作规程的基本知识；经过教育后，事故逐步地减少了。
    在加强劳动纪律教育中，有些企业对个别严重违反劳动纪律屡教不改的分子，依法作了严肃处理。例如地方国营湖南制药厂工人朱世忠，是资本家兼地主家庭出身，曾在反动军队当兵四年多，流氓习气很严重。他从进厂担任压片工人起，长期迟到、早退、旷工、怠工，时常装病，强逼医务室的医生给他写假证明。工厂领导干部和其他工人曾不断对他进行教育，反而遭到他的辱骂。以后他又故意破坏机器。有一次把压片机上的松紧调节器扭松，使压出的片子不合规格，不能包装，返工二十多万片；洗安瓿（盛注射药的瓶子）时，故意将安瓿摔坏；做清洁工作时故意将玻璃窗打坏；并且在外招摇撞骗，到处赊账，生活腐化。朱世忠破坏劳动纪律的行为引起全厂工人的愤慨，许多工人要求清除这个“害群之马”。现在湖南制药厂已将朱世忠开除出厂，工会也开除了他的会籍，长沙市人民法院并判处了他一年六个月徒刑。有些基本建设施工部门也处理了个别严重违反劳动纪律的职工。华北直属第一建筑工程公司技术员林俊夫，工作严重不负责任，数次故意不按照图纸施工，造成工程的返工浪费，并影响工程的质量，虽经领导方面屡次教育，毫不悔改。现在已经北京市人民检察署批准，将他逮捕，并决定向北京市人民法院起诉。中共北京石景山发电厂总支委员会和发电厂行政上，最近也严肃处理了发电厂工人、共产党员李寿安破坏劳动纪律的事件。李寿安在担任锅炉车间磨煤机司磨的时候，工作不负责任，违反操作规程，使价值一亿七千万元的磨煤机牙轮受到损坏，而事后仍隐瞒事故，威胁工人不准暴露真相。今年五月李寿安为骗取磨煤新纪录的荣誉，再度违反操作规程，损坏机器设备，结果终于为助手曹金生制止和揭发。现在石景山发电厂党组织经中共北京市委批准，已开除李寿安出党。北京市人民检察署已批准将李寿安逮捕，并决定向市人民法院提起公诉。
    对严重违反劳动纪律分子的严肃处理，得到了广大职工的衷心支持和欢迎。职工们对这些事件认真展开了讨论。许多职工表示要更好地遵守劳动纪律，搞好生产。国营天津第一棉纺织厂召开职工大会宣布开除严重破坏劳动纪律屡教不改的工人马仓和萧振洲后，工人们广泛展开讨论，并结合各车间的好人好事，坏人坏事，进行表扬和批评，许多工人劳动态度有了改变。一车间女工李淑珍在检查和纠正了过去违反操作规程的错误后，切实遵守操作规程，第二天产量就提高了四、五磅；过去常常旷工的工人翟玉明现在提前进厂做交接班工作。国营青岛第五棉纺织厂织布车间工人毕元香，过去不执行织布工作法，由看二十四台车降到只看十六台车，还经常完不成计划，经过教育后认真执行了织布工作法，提高到看二十八台车，并能完成计划。许多工厂进行了纪律教育后，劳动纪律松懈的情况大为改善，职工的生产热情也提高了。
