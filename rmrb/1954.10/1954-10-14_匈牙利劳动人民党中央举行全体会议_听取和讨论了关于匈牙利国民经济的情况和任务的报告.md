Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 13th. Budapest Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a plenary session from October 1st to 3rd. The meeting heard and discussed the report on the situation and tasks of the Hungarian national economy made by Béla Szalai, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. The meeting also discussed the issue of collective leadership of the Party Central Committee.

Szalai pointed out in his report that since the implementation of the resolutions of the Central Committee of the Working People's Party in June last year and the decisions of the Party and government in December on developing agricultural production, preliminary and important achievements have been obtained. Due to the adoption of measures to take care of the interests of peasants in improving production, the enthusiasm of peasants for production has been greatly enhanced. The area of cultivated land has been expanded. Many important measures have also been taken to increase the yield per unit area of land. The irrigated area of cultivated land has increased by 75,000 holds (approximately 8.55 mu per hold) compared to last year, and animal husbandry has also made significant progress. In industry, the planned industrial reorganization is currently still underway. The production of daily necessities in the first eight months of this year increased by 12.4 percent compared to the same period last year. In the first half of this year, the wages of workers and staff increased by 15.8 percent compared to the same period last year. Since the implementation of the new policy, the national food supply situation has generally been good. In the first half of this year, the national retail trade volume increased by 26 percent compared to the same period last year, and the sales of rural consumer cooperatives increased by 43.4 percent. Due to the above achievements, the working people's confidence in the Party has been further strengthened, the worker-peasant alliance has been further consolidated, and the connection between the Party and the masses has become closer. For the Party, this marks an important political victory and also proves the correctness of the new policy.

Szalai also talked about some shortcomings that hindered the smooth implementation of the new policy, as well as the important tasks of further strengthening the unity of the Party in implementing this policy. He pointed out that it is necessary to accelerate the increase in industrial and agricultural production. The Party and the government should take necessary measures in their work to give top priority to the work of improving agricultural production. The increase in industrial production must ensure the tools needed for agricultural production, the needs of the people for daily necessities and export goods, and the supply of coal and electricity.

The meeting unanimously approved Szalai's report and passed corresponding resolutions.

    匈牙利劳动人民党中央举行全体会议
    听取和讨论了关于匈牙利国民经济的情况和任务的报告
    【新华社布拉格十三日电】布达佩斯消息：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会在十月一日到三日举行了全体会议。会议听取并讨论了中央委员会政治局委员伯·萨拉伊代表中央委员会政治局所作的关于匈牙利国民经济的情况和任务的报告。会议还讨论了党中央委员会的集体领导问题。
    萨拉伊在报告中指出，自从实行劳动人民党中央委员会去年六月的决议和十二月党与政府关于发展农业生产的决议以来，已获得了初步的重要成果。由于采取了照顾农民提高生产的兴趣的办法，农民生产积极性已经大大提高。土地耕种面积已经扩大。在提高土地单位面积产量方面，也采取了许多重要措施。耕地的灌溉面积比去年增加了七万五千霍尔德（每霍尔德约合八点五五市亩），畜牧业也有了重大发展。在工业方面，预定的工业改组工作目前还在继续进行。今年头八个月日用品的生产比去年同期增加了百分之十二点四。今年上半年工人和职员的工资比去年同期增加了百分之十五点八。自从新政策施行以来，人民粮食供应情况一般良好。今年上半年全国零售贸易额比去年同期增加了百分之二十六，农村消费合作社销售额增加了百分之四十三点四。由于以上这些成绩，劳动人民对于党的信心进一步增强了，工农联盟进一步巩固了，党和群众的联系更加密切了。对党来说，这标志着重要的政治胜利，同时也证明了新政策的正确。
    萨拉伊还谈到阻碍新政策顺利执行的一些缺点以及在执行这一政策中进一步加强党的团结的重大任务。他指出必须加速工农业的增产。党和政府在工作中应该采取必要的措施，把提高农业生产的工作提到首要地位。工业增产必须做到能保证农业增产所需的工具，保证人民日用品和出口品的需要，保证煤和电力的供应。
    会议一致批准了萨拉伊的报告，并通过了相应的决议。
