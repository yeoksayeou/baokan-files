Our Porcelain Capital, Jingdezhen
By our reporter Sun Zunian

East of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, there is an ancient town; surrounded by mountains and dotted with chimneys, this is Jingdezhen, the famous porcelain production center of our country.

The five years since liberation have been five years of gradual rebirth for this ancient porcelain capital. Newly built state-owned JianGuo Porcelain Factory, jointly owned public-private porcelain factories, porcelain-making handicraft production cooperatives, and art and craft societies for porcelain processing have appeared on the main streets of the city. Department stores, cultural palaces, cinemas, Peking opera theaters, parks, stadiums, and other facilities serving the economic and cultural life of the vast number of porcelain workers have also been established one after another. It presents a prosperous picture of "porcelain industry flourishes, all industries flourish."

Jingdezhen porcelain, known in ancient times as "sounds like a chime, white as jade, thin as paper, bright as a mirror," is a precious handicraft of the Chinese working people. But the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and imperialists did not like our people to retain this precious wealth. They forced factories to close down, workers to lose their jobs, and painters to switch to peddling and carrying loads. In 1939, the annual output of Jingdezhen porcelain had been reduced to 40,000 dan, only one-twentieth of the highest annual output in 1923. The historically famous porcelain city lost its former glory.

The founding of the People's Republic of China brought new life to this ancient porcelain capital. The city's population has increased from more than 50,000 in 1949 to 100,000 now. The annual output of porcelain in 1950 was more than 297,000 dan, rising to more than 425,000 dan in 1953, and this year it is planned to increase to 600,000 dan.

The Party and the People's Government have always given great care to the restoration and development of porcelain production. The state has established the JianGuo Porcelain Factory, the Porcelain Clay Raw Material Company, and the Porcelain Industry Company here, and has assisted and guided individual handicraftsmen in all aspects, such as supplying raw materials, promoting finished products, improving production technology, and improving quality. The implementation of the state's policy of socialist transformation of handicrafts has opened up broad prospects for the development of Jingdezhen's porcelain production.

Now a large number of individual handicraftsmen have been organized and embarked on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Up to now, seven porcelain-making handicraft production cooperatives have been organized in the city, with the largest having nearly a thousand members and the smallest having two to three hundred members. The cooperatives have further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the handicraftsmen and are conducive to the development of porcelain production. The Second Porcelain Production Cooperative is a good example. This production cooperative has more than 680 members. In the past, they made porcelain blanks separately, and production was often affected by the lack of tools, and the various porcelain blanks made could not be fired in time. Before liberation, most of the kilns here were owned by bureaucratic capitalists, who arbitrarily raised "firing prices" and sought exorbitant profits; many individual producers could not afford to set up their own kilns because of their small capital, and had to endure the cruel exploitation of the kiln owners. Liang Youneng, a member of the Second Porcelain Production Cooperative, made a lot of porcelain blanks in 1947 and agreed with the kiln owner Shao Yuru: the porcelain would be fired and sold, and then the firing fee and interest would be paid. But after the porcelain blanks were fired, the kiln owner went back on his word and said: If you don't have money, you have to keep all the porcelain. Liang Youneng reluctantly pre-sold three thousand teapots and four thousand five hundred teacups to the kiln owner at an 80% discount. His months of hard work were in vain and he suffered a loss of 20%. Last year, he joined the Second Porcelain Production Cooperative.

Since the establishment of the Second Porcelain Production Cooperative, production has gradually increased, averaging 30% higher than when production was decentralized. With the improvement of production, the material life of the members has improved, and they have accumulated a certain amount of capital, which makes it possible to improve labor conditions initially. For example, in the past, hand-cranked pottery wheels were used to make blanks, which was very tiring; now, foot-operated pottery wheels are used to make blanks, which greatly reduces physical labor and increases output by 50%. These facts have greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm and creativity of the members, and increased their confidence in making production semi-mechanized and mechanized.

The improvement of ceramic art is also an important aspect of promoting the development of Jingdezhen's porcelain industry. There are 3,357 artists in the city engaged in this work, most of whom are members of the Porcelain Painting Production Cooperative. In order to strengthen the leadership of ceramic art work, the Jingdezhen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a Ceramic Art Committee, and mobilized artists with higher painting skills to form a craft society to specialize in research and improvement of ceramic art work. The Ministry of Light Industry and the Central Academy of Fine Arts have successively sent ceramic art experts to work with the artists to study and improve the patterns on porcelain. After years of collective creation, ceramic art has made new developments, concentrating the advantages of historical ceramic art work, and creating many works with novel themes and bright colors, which are loved by the broad masses of the people.

At present, Jingdezhen's porcelain is not only supplied to the needs of the broad masses of the people in China, but also its sales abroad are constantly expanding. This April, in order to help the Korean people restore their peaceful life, Jingdezhen's porcelain factories manufactured 180,000 pieces of high-quality daily-use porcelain such as rice bowls and dishes.

The mountains surrounding Jingdezhen are rich in porcelain clay deposits. This is a favorable condition for the development of Jingdezhen's porcelain production. It is expected that in the first quarter of next year, a newly built state-owned electric semi-mechanized porcelain factory and a new kiln will be put into production, and Jingdezhen will show an even newer atmosphere.

    我国瓷都景德镇
    本报记者　孙祖年
    江西省鄱阳湖的东部，有一座古老的城镇；这里四面环山，烟囱林立，这就是我国著名的瓷业生产中心——景德镇。
    解放后的五年，是这个古老的瓷都步步新生的五年。市区主要的街道上出现了新建的国营建国瓷厂，公私合营瓷厂，制瓷手工业生产合作社，以及为瓷器加工的美术工艺社。为广大瓷业工人的经济和文化生活服务的百货商店、文化宫、电影院、京剧院、公园、体育场等也陆续建立起来。这里呈现着一幅“瓷业兴，百业兴”的繁荣图景。
    景德镇的瓷器，古称“声如磬，白如玉，薄如纸，明如镜”，是我国劳动人民宝贵的工艺品。但官僚资产阶级和帝国主义者不喜欢我国人民保留这份宝贵的财富。它们迫使工厂倒闭，工人失业，绘画师转业做小贩和挑伕。一九三九年，景德镇瓷器年产量曾减到四万担，只有一九二三年最高年产量的二十分之一。历史上有名的瓷城消失了它往日的光采。
    中华人民共和国的成立给这个古老的瓷都带来了新生的力量。全市人口从一九四九年的五万多人，增加到现在的十万人。一九五○年瓷器的年产量是二十九万七千多担，一九五三年上升到四十二万五千多担，今年计划增加到六十万担。
    党和人民政府对恢复和发展瓷器生产经常给予很大的关怀。国家在这里建立了建国瓷厂，瓷土原料公司，瓷业公司，并且从供应原料、推销成品、改进生产技术、提高质量等各方面，帮助和指导个体手工业者。国家对手工业的社会主义改造政策的实施，给景德镇瓷业生产开辟了广阔的发展前途。
    现在大批的个体手工业者已经组织起来，走上互助合作的道路。到现在为止，全市已经组织起来七个制瓷手工业生产合作社，其中最大的社有近千名社员，最小的社也有二、三百名社员。合作社更加发挥了手工业者的生产积极性，有利于瓷业生产的发展，第二瓷业生产合作社就是个很好的例子。这个生产合作社，有六百八十多个社员。他们过去分散制瓷坯，经常因缺少工具影响着生产，做出的各种瓷坯也不能及时烧制。解放以前，这里的窑厂，多为官僚资本家所有，他们任意抬高“烧价”，牟取暴利；许多个体生产者因本钱小，自己设不起窑，不得不忍受窑主的残酷剥削。第二瓷业生产合作社社员梁有能，在一九四七年做出很多瓷坯，和窑主邵裕如议好：瓷器烧好卖出，再付烧窑费和利息。但瓷坯烧好以后，窑主反脸不认账，说：没有钱就得把瓷器全部扣下。梁有能忍痛把三千把壶，四千五百只茶杯以八折预售给窑主，自己几个月辛辛苦苦的生产，白白遭受了百分之二十的损失。去年他加入了第二瓷业生产合作社。
    第二瓷业生产合作社成立以来，生产量逐步上升，平均比分散生产时提高百分之三十。随着生产的提高，社员的物质生活改善了，而且有了一定的积累，这就有可能使劳动条件得到初步的改善。如过去使用手摇辘轳车制坯，弯腰曲背，非常累人；现在改用脚踏辘轳车制坯，大大减轻了体力劳动，产量也提高了百分之五十。这些事实大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性和创造性，提高了使生产走向半机械化、机械化的信心。
    陶瓷美术工作的改进，也是促进景德镇瓷业发展的一个重要方面。全市从事这个工作的艺人有三千三百五十七人，大部分都是画瓷业生产合作社的社员。中共景德镇市委为了加强对陶瓷美术工作的领导，组织了陶瓷美术委员会，并发动绘画技术较高的艺人组成工艺社，专门研究和改进陶瓷美术工作。轻工业部和中央美术学院先后派来了陶瓷美术专家，和艺人们一道研究改进瓷器的画面。经过几年来的集体创作，陶瓷美术有了新的发展，集中了历史上陶瓷美术工作的优点，创造了许多主题新颖、色彩鲜明的作品，受到了广大人民的喜爱。
    现在，景德镇出产的瓷器除供应国内广大人民需要外，国外的销路也在不断扩大。今年四月为帮助朝鲜人民恢复和平生活，景德镇的瓷厂就制造了十八万件质量很好的饭碗、菜碟等日用瓷器。
    景德镇周围群山中，蕴藏着丰富的瓷土矿藏。这是发展景德镇瓷业生产的有利条件。预计明年第一季度，一座国家新建电动半机械化的瓷器工厂和新的窑厂就要投入生产，景德镇又将出现更新的气象。
