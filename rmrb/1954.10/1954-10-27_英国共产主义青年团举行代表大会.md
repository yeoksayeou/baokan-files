Xinhua News Agency, London, 26th Dispatch: The 20th Congress of the British Communist Youth League was held in London from the 23rd to the 24th. Two hundred and fifty delegates attended the congress. Representatives from the British Communist Party, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and youth from Malaya and other countries also attended the congress.

    John Moss, Secretary of the National Committee of the British Communist Youth League, delivered a political report to the congress. Moss first spoke about the current international situation, pointing out that the danger of arming Germany is the main issue in the current political situation. The real alternative to arming West Germany is to establish a broad-based collective security system.

    Moss condemned the American aggressive plans in the Far East, accusing the American fleet of provoking incidents in the Taiwan Straits and praising the peaceful policies of the People's Republic of China, which guaranteed "the prestige and international influence of the People's Republic of China."

    Moss also talked about the situation in Britain last year and the tasks of the British Communist Youth League, emphasizing the need to strive to form a mass youth movement, achieve consistency in action with the youth organizations of the Labour Party and the Cooperative Party, and strengthen the international solidarity of youth from all countries.

    George Matthews, representative of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the tasks of the British Communist Youth League are: to fight for the immediate interests of youth, to oppose the revival of German militarism, and to struggle for peace and socialism.

    On the 23rd, the congress discussed Moss's political report. Representatives who spoke during the discussion introduced the work experience of various local youth league organizations in organizing youth to oppose the arming of West Germany and to fight for their own rights, and in striving for consistent action among various youth organizations.

    Liverpool dockworker Danny Smith, in his speech, paid tribute to the congress on behalf of the striking dockworkers, pointing out that the current difficult situation of the dockworkers is the reason for the largest dockworker strike in nearly thirty years.

    After the discussion, the congress adopted the proposal of the Cypriot Communist Youth League, which condemned the establishment of new military bases in Cyprus and demanded the withdrawal of British troops. The congress also elected a new National Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    The congress closed on the 24th. At the closing session, the congress unanimously adopted the political report of the National Committee and took this report as a guideline for future work.

    Moss delivered the closing speech to the congress. He reiterated that the most important task of the British Communist Youth League at present is to organize youth to widely protest the revival of German militarism. He said: The broad masses of young people should be told that there is another way to solve the German problem, which is to establish a peaceful, unified, and democratic Germany and to establish a European collective security system, as pointed out in the Soviet note to Western countries.

    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产主义青年团第二十次代表大会在二十三日到二十四日在伦敦举行。出席这次大会的，有二百五十名代表。英国共产党、世界民主青年联盟、以及马来亚青年及其他国家青年的代表，也出席了大会。
    英国共产主义青年团全国委员会书记约翰·摩斯向大会作了政治报告。摩斯首先谈到当前国际局势，指出武装德国的危险是当前政治局势中的主要问题。真正可以代替武装西德的另外一条路是建立包罗甚广的集体安全体系。
    摩斯谴责美国在远东的侵略计划，指责美国舰队在台湾海面挑衅，并且赞扬中华人民共和国的和平政策保证了“中华人民共和国的威信和国际影响”。
    摩斯还谈到英国去年的情况和英国共产主义青年团的任务，强调要努力形成群众性的青年运动，和工党及合作党的青年组织取得行动的一致，加强各国青年的国际团结。
    英国共产党执行委员会代表乔治·马修斯在会上发了言。他指出：英国共产主义青年团的任务是：争取青年的切身利益，反对复活德国军国主义，为和平和社会主义而斗争。
    大会在二十三日讨论了摩斯的政治报告。在讨论中发言的代表介绍了青年团各地方组织在组织青年反对武装西德及争取自己的权利、争取各青年组织一致行动方面的工作经验。
    利物浦码头工人丹尼·史密斯在发言中代表罢工的码头工人向大会致敬，指出目前码头工人的艰苦境况是造成近三十年来最大的一次码头工人罢工的原因，
    大会在讨论结束后通过了塞浦路斯共产主义青年团组织的提案，这个提案谴责在塞浦路斯建立新的军事基地，要求英军撤退。大会还选出了共产主义青年团新的全国委员会。
    大会在二十四日闭幕。在闭幕会上，大会一致通过了全国委员会的政治报告，并把这个报告作为今后工作的指导方针。
    摩斯向大会致闭幕词。他再度指出：英国共产主义青年团目前最重要的任务，就是组织青年广泛地抗议复活德国军国主义。他说：应当告诉广大的青年们：现在还有另一条解决德国问题的道路，这就是苏联致西方国家的照会中所指出的建立一个和平、统一和民主的德国以及建立欧洲集体安全体系的道路。
