    A Look at the Soviet Union's Land Transportation Industry from the Soviet Exhibition
    Fu Dong
    In the east yard of the Industrial Pavilion at the Soviet Exhibition, there are many cars on display: self-unloading trucks as big as small houses, beautiful ZIS-brand cars, light Moskvich cars, as well as the latest fire trucks and motorcycles with sidecars....
    Whether it's rainy or sunny, it's always crowded there. People's Liberation Army soldiers, cadres, students, or citizens are drawn to the red and green cars as soon as they arrive. Workers, in particular, are often reluctant to leave. They surround the 25-ton automatic unloading truck, watching how it goes up and down, using its large bucket to unload goods. From the crowd, praises are constantly heard: "This guy, don't underestimate its size, it's really flexible!" "The largest American car only carries seven tons!" Some people even like to go up to the car and compare their height with the wheel. Some people keep asking questions while watching: "How much can it carry?" "Is it heavy to drive?" The guide doesn't know which one to answer first. The guide tells everyone that the wheels of this car are designed so large to make it easier to drive on construction sites. It is also very strong and can withstand strong impacts. This car burns diesel, has great horsepower (300 horsepower), and saves money. Its current voltage is also very high, making it easy to start. The car is equipped with a hydraulic booster, making it as light to drive as a small car, and even a very small turn can be made. The brakes on the car are so sensitive that no matter how fast the car is driving, as long as the brakes are gently applied, the car will stop immediately.
    When the guide said this, some experienced people began to discuss: "In my experience, the brakes of cars in many countries (referring to capitalist countries) break down every now and then, I have never seen such a sturdy one!"
  "I have only seen trucks with a load capacity of seven tons, with low horsepower and using gasoline; if you drive continuously for four hours, your arms will be so sore that you can't lift them. If you encounter a small turn, you have to back up."
    Some viewers wanted to know more, so they went to the comrades who installed the cars. The answer was: this large truck can automatically unload 25 tons of cargo in 30 seconds; if manpower were used, it would take 500 people, and the time required would be two minutes. This type of vehicle, which is equivalent to eight large trucks, played a significant role in the construction of large-scale hydropower stations, canals, and other large-scale construction projects in the Soviet Union.
    In the yard, there is also a green monster that looks like a car head and a machine. It occasionally stretches out two large forks, slowly rises, and gently falls. The guide said: This is called a forklift, and it can load and unload 3,000 kilograms of cargo at a time. Factories, construction sites, railway freight yards, and sea and river wharves can use it to load and unload heavy or bulk cargo. Next to it, a gray one can carry 5,000 kilograms; another red one, powered by electricity, can load 1,500 kilograms. This type of vehicle has many advantages: it can travel 70 to 80 li per hour on the highway; if the loading and unloading forks are not suitable, they can be replaced with a hopper and a crane boom.
    In front of a black, long-bodied car, there are often many people standing. This is the ZIS-110 car. Its carriage is very large and can seat seven people. The car also has an electric meter, heating, and radio equipment. The glass between the rear carriage and the front carriage is soundproof, and people sitting in the rear carriage cannot hear the noise in the driver's cabin. The car is very fast and can travel 140 kilometers per hour. The engine has eight cylinders, and no matter how fast the car goes, people sitting on the seats feel like they are sitting on a sofa at home and do not feel any vibration.
    In this square, there is also a small car, which is the light and flexible Moskvich car. It is very fuel-efficient, using only nine liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers.
    Not far from the Moskvich car is a red-bottomed, yellow-edged bus. The car body is long and wide, but there are only 28 seats inside; it also has air-conditioning and heating equipment. Whether it is winter or summer, the car can maintain the warmth of spring. The audience said after seeing it: The Soviet Party and government really think about the working people in everything.
    After taking a tour of the square, people naturally think of the large artistic pictures of automobile production and use and the electric light charts of automobile transportation volume growth hanging on the east side of the Industrial Pavilion. Everyone knows that before the October Socialist Revolution, Russia had only 8,800 cars in total. The Soviet regime established a strong automobile industry, and the Gorky Automobile Plant alone has designed and manufactured 67 different types of cars in the past 20 years. The Moscow Stalin Automobile Plant now produces an average of one car every four minutes. As early as before World War II, the Soviet Union had 760,000 trucks, ranking first in Europe, and there has been a large increase in recent years. The Soviet Union has more than 200,000 kilometers of highways, nine times more than before the revolution. The transport volume in 1953 increased by three and a half times compared with 1940. In the future, the automobile transport capacity will be further improved. It is estimated that by 1955, the automobile transport volume will increase by more than 80% compared with 1950.
    In the square where train locomotives and passenger cars are displayed, there is always a long line of people; even if it is raining heavily, some people are waiting there wearing raincoats and holding umbrellas.
    People often visit the (Л) type freight locomotive first. From the outside, it looks no different from ordinary locomotives, just cleaner and tidier. But after climbing into the car and taking a closer look, you can find many new things inside. This car can automatically add coal, automatically add oil, and automatically add water. When train drivers are mentioned, people will associate them with the scene of constantly shoveling coal while sweating after the train starts, working nervously. But in such a locomotive, the driver only needs to control the speed regulator, and the coal will roll into the boiler from the coal bunker. We also know that this type of locomotive can travel 80 kilometers per hour on a flat road, 21 kilometers per hour on a slope of 9/1000, and can pull 1,780 tons.
    Next to this light locomotive, there is a blue train, which people thought was a passenger car carriage! After climbing up and taking a look, they realized that it was a locomotive. The car was cleaned up really well, without a trace of coal smoke. It turned out that it was powered by electricity. The guide told everyone that its advantage is that it is not restricted by the cold or heat of the climate, and it can also run in places where water and fuel are scarce. It is most suitable for mountain roads or large tunnels. As early as before World War II, the Soviet Union had realized the electrification of 2,000 kilometers of railways. After the war, the speed of electrification accelerated, and now electric locomotives are running on 9,000 kilometers of railways. Facts show that the degree of railway transportation electrification in the Soviet Union has exceeded that of any capitalist country.
    The two green passenger car carriages on the track are also attractive enough. On the soft-seat passenger car, audiences have said more than once: "This carriage is simply like a living room. Sitting on this sofa-like berth, you won't feel tired no matter how far you travel." Some people even counted the furnishings in the car one by one: this is a desk lamp, this is a small hanging lamp, this is a loudspeaker, and that is the equipment to eliminate dust in the car and maintain the indoor temperature.... The conductor's valve on the car also aroused people's interest. This thing looks small, but it has a big effect. If someone falls under the car while the car is moving, people on the car can immediately stop the car by pulling the conductor's valve. The equipment on the hard-seat car is similar to this, but there are more beds. These fully reflect the Soviet Party and the state's concern for people.
    Here, people can also see tank cars equipped with air pressure safety valves and air inlet valves to prevent oil from leaking, and motor locomotives for shunting.
    When the audience leaves the square, they feel unspeakable excitement in their hearts. Because they saw the great achievements of the Soviet Union's land transportation industry from the exhibits in the exhibition, and they also saw the future of the motherland's transportation industry.

    从苏联展览会看苏联的陆上交通运输业
    傅冬
    在苏联展览会工业馆的东面有个大院子，院里摆着许多汽车：有像小房子一样大的自卸运输车、漂亮的吉斯牌小汽车，有轻巧的莫斯科人小汽车，也有最新式的消防车、带跨斗的摩托车……。
    不论雨天或是晴天，那儿经常挤满了人。那些人民解放军战士、干部、学生或市民一走到这儿，就被那红红绿绿的汽车吸引住了。特别是工人，到了这儿往往舍不得离开。他们围住那辆载重二十五吨的自动卸货卡车，看它怎样一上一下，用大斗子来卸货。人群中不时发出这样的赞美声：“这家伙，别瞧它块头大，动作可真灵活！”“美国最大的汽车才载重七吨！”有些人还爱走到车跟前比比自己有没车轮高。有些人一面看一面不停地发问：“它能拉多重的东西？”“它开起来重不重？”弄得讲解员不知该先回答那一个好。讲解员告诉大家：这辆车的车轮所以设计得这样大，是为了使它在工地上走起来更加方便。它也很结实，能经受住强烈的撞击。这车烧的是柴油，马力大（有三百匹马力），又省钱。它的电流电压也很大，容易发动。车厢里装有液压加力器，车开起来和小汽车一样轻，一个很小的弯子都能拐过来。车上的刹车那么灵便，不管车开的多快，只要把刹车轻轻一踩，车马上就停了。
    讲解员说到这里，某些有经验的人就议论开了：“在我的经验中，许多国家（指资本主义国家）的汽车，刹车三天两头坏，没见过这样结实的！”
  “我只见过载重七吨重的卡车，马力既小还得用汽油；要是在车上连续开四个钟头，胳膊就酸痛得抬不起了。碰上个小弯子，得倒回去。”
    有的观众想更多知道一点，就去找安装汽车的同志。回答是：这个大卡车能在三十秒的时间里自动卸完二十五吨的货物；如果用人力的话，就需要五百个人，而所需时间则是两分钟。这种能顶八个大卡车用的车子，在苏联建造大水力发电站、大运河以及其他大规模的建筑工程中，起了很大的作用。
    院子里还有一个绿色的又像汽车头，又像机器的怪物。它不时地伸出两个大叉子，慢慢地升起，又轻轻地落下。讲解员说：这叫叉式装卸车，一下就可以装卸三千公斤的货物。工厂、建筑工地、铁路货场和海河码头可以用它来装卸笨重或散装的货物。旁边一个灰色的，可搬运五千公斤的东西；另一部红颜色的车子，用电来发动，可装一千五百公斤的货物，这种车有许多优点：在公路上它每小时可以行走七、八十里；装卸叉如果不合用，可换箕形斗和起重臂。
    在一辆黑色的车身长长的小汽车跟前，也常站着不少的人。这是吉斯一一○型小汽车。它的车厢很大，可坐七个人。车里还有电表、暖气和无线电设备。后边车厢和前边车厢的玻璃能隔音，坐在车厢后面的人听不见司机室里的闹声，车的速度很快，每小时可行一百四十公里。发动机里有八个汽缸，不管车走多么快，坐在车座上面的人都像坐在家里的沙发上一样，感觉不到震动。
    在这个广场上，还有一辆小小的汽车，这就是轻便灵活的莫斯科人小汽车。它很省油，走一百公里才用九公升汽油。
    莫斯科人小汽车对面不远摆着一辆红底黄边的公共汽车。车身既长又宽，但里面只有二十八个座位；还有冷暖气设备。不论冬天或伏天，车里可以保持像春天一样的温暖。观众看了都说：苏联党和政府真处处为劳动人民着想。
    在广场上绕了一圈，人们很自然地会想到工业馆东侧厅墙上挂的汽车生产和使用情况的大幅美术图片及汽车运输量增长的电光图表。大家知道，在十月社会主义革命以前，俄国一共才有八千八百辆汽车，苏维埃政权时期才建立了强大的汽车工业，单是高尔基汽车工厂，在最近二十年里就设计和制造了六十七种不同类型的汽车。莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂现在平均每四分钟生产一部汽车。早在第二次大战前苏联载重汽车就有七十六万辆，占欧洲各国的第一位，近年来更有大量的增加。苏联全国公路共有二十多万公里，为革命以前的九倍。一九五三年的运输量比一九四○年增加了三倍半。今后汽车运输能力还要提高，估计到一九五五年汽车运输量将比一九五○年增加百分之八十以上。
    在陈列火车机车和客车的广场上，不论什么时候，都有一长排一长排的队伍；即使雨下得很大，也有人披着雨衣打着伞等在那里。
    人们常常先参观（Л）型货运机车。从外面看，它和一般的机车没什么两样，只是干净整齐些。可是爬上车仔细一看，你可以在里头发现不少新玩艺。这车可以自动加煤，自动加油，自动给水。一提到火车司机，人们就会联想到在火车开动后司机不停地挥着汗一铲一铲地加煤，紧张工作的情景。而在这样的机车里，司机只要掌握调速器，煤就会从煤箱滚进锅炉。我们还知道，这种机车在平道上一点钟可走八十公里，在千分之九的坡道上一点钟走二十一公里，可拉一千七百八十吨。
    紧挨着这轻机车的旁边，有一辆蓝色的列车，人们都以为它是辆客车车厢呢！爬上去一看，才晓得这是辆机车。车里收拾得可真干净，没有一丝儿煤烟，原来它是用电来发动的。讲解员告诉大家，它的优点是不受气候冷热的限制，在缺水缺燃料的地方同样可以行驶。它最适用于山道或大隧道。早在第二次大战前，苏联就有二千公里的铁路实现了电气化，战后电气化的速度更加快了，现在已有九千公里的铁路上行驶着电气机车。事实说明，苏联铁路运输电气化的程度已超过了任何一个资本主义国家。
    轨道上的两辆绿色客车车厢，也是够吸引人的。在软席客车上曾不止一次地听到观众说：“这车厢简直和客厅一样，坐在这沙发似的卧铺上走多远的路也不会觉得累。”有人还一件一件地数着车里的摆设：这是台灯，这是小挂灯，这是扩音器，那是消除车内灰尘、保持室内温度的设备……。车上的车长阀，也引起人们的兴趣。这玩艺看起来很小，但作用很大。如果车行走时，有人跌到车下，车上的人只要一扳车长阀，车马上就停了。硬席车上的设备跟这也差不多，只是床铺多一些。这些都充分体现了苏联党和国家对人的关怀。
    在这里，人们还可以看到装有气压安全阀和进气阀，使石油不会外流的油罐车和调车用的摩托机车。
    当观众离开广场的时候，心里都有说不出的兴奋。因为他们从展览会中的展品看到了苏联陆上交通运输业的伟大成就，也看到了祖国交通运输业的将来。（附图片）
