    Tractor Factory Construction Receives Strong Support from Local People
    The tractor factory construction site has received strong support from the local people. Many workers, farmers, and women have reported, requesting to participate in the support work for the tractor factory. They organized a strong road construction team to rush to repair the temporary roads leading to the construction site. They automatically launched a labor competition and completed a gravel road six days ahead of schedule. On a road crossing the fields, hundreds of farmers, rickshaw pullers, and transport workers are busy transporting materials every day. Thousands of men and women sit on the riverbanks, smashing stones and digging yellow sand, preparing the necessary building materials for the construction site. Suburban vegetable farmers expanded the vegetable cultivation area by more than 1,000 mu this year to supply the needs of the construction site; recently, they are cultivating winter vegetables to ensure that construction workers can eat fresh vegetables in winter.
    The employees of local state-owned industries are also working hard to serve the tractor factory. They are overcoming difficulties, turning farm tool factories and iron factories into repair shops, preparing to do automobile repair work for the tractor factory. Workers at the ironware production cooperatives are working hard to manufacture iron nails and screws for the construction site. Cement pipe factories, printing factories, and furniture factories that serve the construction site are also under construction.
    Trade, culture and education, and health departments are also working hard to support the tractor factory. The cooperatives, department stores, and food companies at the construction site have purchased sufficient necessary items for the workers. Mobile cultural service teams, film projection teams, and medical service teams can often be seen on the construction site. The post office, bank, medical room, barbershop, and bathroom at the construction site have been built.
    A temporary building commonly used in southern construction sites - a bamboo structure house - appeared at the tractor factory construction site. This was built by the East China workers supporting the tractor factory.
    With their years of experience, East China workers can build houses entirely out of bamboo without using a brick, a piece of wood, or an iron nail. The cost of this bamboo house is very low. It only costs about 70,000 yuan to build one square meter of bamboo structure house; while it costs about 400,000 yuan to build one square meter of brick and wood structure temporary house. The speed of building this bamboo house is also very fast. In just ten days, a 2,000-square-meter bamboo structure dining hall was built. Thousands of workers can now sit inside to eat. Local farmers were surprised to see such a fast speed. They said, "A few days ago, this was still a large open space, and today it is full of houses. This is really amazing!"
    Now this type of bamboo structure temporary building is widely used at the tractor factory construction site. Many temporary dormitories, dining halls, kitchens, toilets, warehouses, and cooperatives are built of bamboo. The completion of this bamboo structure temporary building not only saves a large amount of wood and bricks, but also speeds up the progress of the project.
    In order to better build the permanent dormitory project, East China workers also used bamboo to make a batch of scaffolding for bricklaying. This bamboo scaffolding is light, fast, and reliable, even better than wood. And the cost of this bamboo scaffolding is also very low. It only costs 94,000 yuan to make a ten-square-meter (calculated according to the area of the wall) bamboo scaffold.

    拖拉机制造厂工程得到当地人民有力支援
    拖拉机制造厂工地得到当地人民有力的支援。许多工人、农民和妇女纷纷报告，要求参加拖拉机制造厂的支援工作。他们组织一支强大的筑路队伍，赶修通往工地的临时公路。他们自动地开展劳动竞赛，曾经提前六天修好一条碎石公路。在一条穿过田野的道路上，每天都有好几百农民、人力车工人和运输工人，忙碌地运送材料。上千的男男女女坐在河滩上，砸石子，挖黄沙，为工地准备着必需的建筑材料。郊区的菜农今年扩大蔬菜耕种面积一千多亩，供应工地的需要；最近又正在培植冬季蔬菜，保证建筑工人在冬天也能吃到新鲜的蔬菜。
    地方国营工业的职工们也努力为拖拉机制造厂服务。他们克服着困难，把农具厂、铁工厂，改变为修配厂，准备替拖拉机厂做汽车修配工作。铁业生产合作社的工人正紧张地为工地制造铁钉、螺丝。为工地服务的水泥制管厂、印刷厂和家具厂都在筹建中。
    贸易、文教和卫生部门也努力支援拖拉机制造厂。工地的合作社、百货公司和食品公司给工人们采购了充足的必需的物品。在工地上常常可以看到流动的文化服务队、电影放映队和医疗服务队。工地的邮局、银行、医疗室、理发室和浴室，已经建设起来。
    拖拉机制造厂工地出现一种南方建筑工地常用的临时建筑物——竹结构房屋。这是支援拖拉机制造厂的华东工人修建的。
    华东工人以他们多年的经验，不用一块砖瓦、一根木料和一个铁钉，完全用竹子就能造成房屋。这种竹房子的造价是很低廉的。修筑一平方公尺的竹结构房屋，只要七万元左右；而修筑一平方公尺的砖木结构临时房屋，就需要四十万元左右。修筑这种竹房子的速度也是非常快的。在短短的十天里，一座两千平方公尺的竹结构大饭厅就盖好了。上千工人已能坐在里面吃饭。当地农民看到这样快的速度，都很惊讶，他们说：“前几天这里还是一大片空地，今天就布满房屋，这真是了不起呀！”
    现在拖拉机制造厂工地已普遍使用这种竹结构临时建筑物。许多临时的宿舍、饭厅、厨房、厕所、仓库和合作社，都是用竹子建成的。这种竹结构临时房屋的建成，不但节省大批木料和砖瓦，而且加快了工程的进度。
    华东工人为了更好地修成永久宿舍工程，还用竹子做好一批砌墙用的脚手架。这种竹子的脚手架，又轻快，又牢靠，比木料做的还好。而这种竹子的脚手架的成本也很低。做一个十平方公尺（按墙身的面积计算）的竹脚手架，只要九万四千元。
