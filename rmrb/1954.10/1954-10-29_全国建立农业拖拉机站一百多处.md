    More Than 100 Agricultural Tractor Stations Established Nationwide
    [From Our Own Correspondent] By September of this year, the number of agricultural machine tractor stations established in various regions has increased to 113, with a total of more than 700 standard tractors (15 horsepower each). These tractor stations provide machine cultivation services to agricultural production cooperatives, collective farms, and mutual aid teams, covering a total area of over 600,000 mu throughout the year. These tractor stations are mainly distributed in the major grain and cotton producing areas north of the Huai River and in Northeast and Northwest China, including 14 provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi, as well as the cities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Among them, 28 are located in major cotton-producing areas, and 85 are located in grain crop areas.
    These tractor stations have played a significant role in increasing agricultural production and promoting mutual assistance and cooperation. In the villages and cooperatives that the tractor stations in Liaoning Province have helped cultivate, they have promoted agricultural techniques such as seed selection, disinfection, close planting, and the application of granular fertilizers. The autumn harvest of crops is expected to increase by 20 percent. This spring, the Ninghe Tractor Station in Hebei Province provided machine cultivation services to 3,300 mu of paddy fields for two collective farms and five agricultural production cooperatives. The autumn harvest is expected to yield an average of 100 to 200 jin more rice per mu than ordinary villages. The Fengyang Mentai Zi Tractor Station in Anhui Province sends an agricultural technician to regularly guide the production of the Huaiguang Collective Farm, assisting in formulating production plans, adjusting crop rotations, and connecting land. For example, on land that was plowed last winter, they promptly changed to planting 1,256 mu of high-yield summer-ripening potatoes. This not only increased the farm's agricultural income for one season but also allowed the potatoes and wheat to mature simultaneously, which improved the crop rotation. After the Maoling Tractor Station in Shaanxi Province began machine cultivation in the summer, farmers in the vicinity quickly organized 14 mutual aid teams. The Bian Zhicai mutual aid team in Liuwei Village, 15 li away from the station, also plans to plant autumn land together in preparation for transitioning to a cooperative.
    Among the established tractor stations, the Huachuan, Beijing, and Changzhi stations, which have been established for a longer period, are playing an even more significant role. The villages and cooperatives they serve have seen even greater production increases this year compared to previous years. The Huachuan Tractor Station in Heilongjiang Province is helping the Xinghuo Collective Farm plant 6,000 mu of rice, with an estimated total output of over 4.2 million jin. The land cultivated by the Beijing and Changzhi stations saw more than double the wheat yield during this year's summer harvest compared to last year.

    全国建立农业拖拉机站一百多处
      【本报讯】各地建立的农业机器拖拉机站，到今年九月份已增加到一百一十三处，约计共有拖拉机七百多标准台（每台十五马力）。这些拖拉机站为农业生产合作社、集体农庄和互助组等进行机器耕作的土地面积，全年可达六十多万亩。这些拖拉机站主要分布在淮河以北和东北、西北各主要粮棉产区，包括河北、山东、黑龙江、陕西等十四个省和北京市、天津市、内蒙古自治区。其中有二十八处是设在主要棉产区，八十五处设在粮谷作物地区。
    这些拖拉机站，对于农业增产和促进互助合作都起了显著的作用。辽宁省的拖拉机站在它帮助耕作的庄、社中，推广了选种、消毒、密植、施用颗粒肥料等农业技术，秋收的庄稼可增产百分之二十。河北省宁河拖拉机站今春给两个集体农庄、五个农业生产合作社用机器耕作的三千三百亩稻田，秋收平均每亩要比一般村的多收一百斤到两百斤稻谷。安徽省凤阳门台子拖拉机站，派农业技师一人，经常指导淮光集体农庄的生产，帮助制订生产计划，调整庄稼茬口，串连土地。如在去年冬耕地上及时改种了高产夏熟作物马铃薯一千二百五十六亩，不仅增加了农庄一季农业收入，并且使马铃薯与小麦同时成熟，也顺换了茬口。陕西省茂陵拖拉机站夏季开始机器耕作后，附近农民很快地组织起十四个互助组。距站十五里远的留位村边致才等互助组还计划把秋地种在一起，准备转社。
    在已建立的拖拉机站中，建立时间较长的桦川、北京、长治等站发挥的作用更加显著。它们所服务的庄、社今年比往年增产更多。黑龙江省桦川拖拉机站帮助星火集体农庄种的六千亩水稻，估计总产量在四百二十万斤以上。北京、长治两站所耕作的土地上，今年夏收小麦都比去年增产一倍多。
