    Self-Criticism of the Mistake of Destroying Books
    A joint letter from the Xinhua Bookstore Southwest General Branch and the People's Publishing House and the People's Education Publishing House Southwest Joint Office: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column published on July 31st contained a letter from the reader Xiang Rong, criticizing our erroneous decision to destroy the book "Illustrated Explanation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China." This criticism is correct.
    In January 1952, in order to cooperate with the Marriage Law publicity campaign, the Xinhua Bookstore Southwest General Branch (hereinafter referred to as the General Branch) ordered 2.4 million copies of the popular edition of "Illustrated Explanation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China" from the original Southwest People's Publishing House (now renamed the People's Publishing House and the People's Education Publishing House Southwest Joint Office, hereinafter referred to as the Publishing House). At that time, the Publishing House delivered 162,100 copies overdue. According to the production and sales contract between the two parties, the late delivery was treated as consignment, and those not sold after one year of consignment should be returned to the Publishing House. In 1953, when the consignment period expired, the two parties agreed to extend the consignment period for another six months. This spring, the General Branch, considering that the book had been published for more than two years, and the consignment period had reached two years and two months, but there were still more than 800,000 copies in stock in the entire region in March and April, proposed to the Publishing House to recover the consigned part to settle the accounts. After negotiation between the two parties, the Publishing House agreed to recover them. However, because the General Branch had no inventory, the Publishing House proposed that the branch stores must return the book covers to settle the accounts, and the two parties completed the return procedures according to this agreement.
    This issue illustrates our errors and shortcomings in our work. First of all, the order quantity initially proposed by the General Branch was subjectively blind, coupled with poor promotion, resulting in more than 800,000 copies of inventory despite two key recommendations and one price reduction sale, causing 1.2 billion yuan of state funds to be tied up for a long time and unable to circulate. Secondly, our adoption of the method of destroying more than 160,000 consigned books is completely wrong. Because this not only caused a loss of more than 140 million yuan to the state, but more importantly, it prevented books that had not yet lost their timeliness from playing their due political role among readers, causing serious political losses. Therefore, this treatment reflects that we still retain serious capitalist business thinking. Thirdly, we decided to do so without asking for instructions from the higher-level leading organs beforehand, which is an act of disorganization and indiscipline. We accept this lesson and will strive to improve our future publishing and distribution work to ensure that similar errors do not occur again.
    The Xinhua Bookstore General Branch has recently issued a notice that this book can be donated to readers locally through the Women's Federation, and we agree with this approach.

### 检讨销毁书籍的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

     检讨销毁书籍的错误
    新华书店西南总分店和人民出版社、人民教育出版社西南联合办事处联名来信：七月三十一日
  “读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者向融的来信，批评我们错误地决定将“中华人民共和国婚姻法图解”
  一书销毁。这个批评是正确的。
    一九五二年一月，为了配合婚姻法宣传运动，新华书店西南总分店（以下简称总分店）即向原西南人民出版社（现已改为人民出版社、人民教育出版社西南联合办事处，以下简称出版社）订印“中华人民共和国婚姻法图解”通俗本二百四十万册。当时出版社有十六万二千一百册逾期交货，按双方产销合同规定，迟交部分按寄售处理，寄售满一年仍不能销出者应退回出版社。一九五三年寄售期满时，双方协议再延长半年寄售期限。今年春季，总分店鉴于该书从出版到现在二年多，寄售期已达二年零两个月，但在三、四月间全区仍存八十余万册，因此向出版社提出收回寄售部分以了帐务。经双方协议，出版社同意收回。但因总分店已无存货，出版社提出必须由分支店退回书籍封面以凭结帐，双方即以此协议办理了退货手续。
    这一问题说明了我们工作中的错误和缺点。首先，当初总分店提出的订货数字就是主观盲目的，再加推销不力，以致虽然经过两次重点推荐，一次降价出售，仍余八十余万册的存货，使十二亿元国家资金长期积压不得周转。其次，我们对十六余万册寄售书采取销毁办法来处理是完全错误的。因为这既给国家造成一亿四千余万元的损失，更重要的是使尚未失时效的书籍不能在读者中发挥应有的政治作用，造成政治上的严重损失。所以这样处理，反映了我们还残存着严重的资本主义经营思想。再次，我们决定这样做，事前并未请示上级领导机关，这是一种无组织无纪律的行为。我们接受这一教训，当努力改进今后的出版发行工作，保证不再发生类似的错误。
    新华书店总店最近已发出通知，此书可就地通过妇联赠送读者，我们同意这个做法。
