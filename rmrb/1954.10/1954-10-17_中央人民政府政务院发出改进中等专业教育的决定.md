    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision on improving secondary specialized education on September 26. The decision stated: Secondary specialized schools have achieved considerable success in adjustment, rectification, and reform. Various types of secondary specialized schools (excluding secondary normal schools) are gradually being transferred to the leadership of relevant business departments, and are beginning to train cadres according to the needs of various departments of the national economy and the principles of specialization. Most schools have established specialized fields and have begun teaching according to new teaching plans and syllabuses, thereby establishing the foundation for a new system of secondary specialized education. However, the current state of secondary specialized education is not yet in line with the requirements of national construction and development, and there are still many problems in the work. The main problems are insufficient planning in cadre training, insufficient efforts in learning from Soviet advanced experience and promoting teaching reform, generally weak political and ideological leadership in schools, and multiple leadership in schools. These shortcomings greatly affect the quality of cadre training. The decision pointed out: In the future, secondary specialized education should be vigorously rectified and developed in a planned manner, consolidate existing achievements, overcome various shortcomings, and pay special attention to determining the length of study, further clarifying leadership relationships, strengthening leadership, striving to learn from Soviet advanced experience, and actively improving teaching to improve the quality of teaching.

    The decision pointed out: Secondary specialized schools must attach great importance to production teaching (including teaching practice and production practice) to strengthen the connection between theory and practice in teaching. The time for teaching practice and production practice in secondary specialized schools should account for 25 to 35 percent of the theoretical teaching time. Secondary specialized schools must vigorously correct teaching methods that separate theory from practice, and pay attention to cultivating students' ability to work independently. The principals of secondary specialized schools must strengthen unified leadership within the school and reduce unnecessary extracurricular activities to ensure the implementation of the teaching plan.

    The decision stipulates the following study durations for various types of secondary specialized schools: three to four years for industrial secondary specialized schools, three years for agricultural, forestry, medical, and other secondary specialized schools, and two and a half to three years for planning, economic, and accounting secondary specialized schools. Part-time secondary specialized night schools should increase the study duration by one to two years compared to regular secondary specialized schools of the same type.

    Regarding the improvement of teaching work, the decision stipulated the principles for formulating and revising teaching plans and syllabuses. The phenomenon of arbitrarily changing teaching plans and syllabuses during the academic year should be corrected. The current incomplete and transitional teaching plans should also be gradually abolished.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of secondary specialized schools, the decision stipulates that under the unified leadership of the Higher Education Department of the Central People's Government, all types of secondary specialized schools are under the charge of the relevant central business departments. In order to enhance the efficiency of leadership work, in principle, the relevant central business departments should implement centralized and unified direct leadership over their subordinate secondary specialized schools. Due to the excessive number of schools and the smaller number of specialties, secondary agricultural schools and secondary medical schools can currently implement a method of direct management by the agricultural and forestry departments/bureaus and health departments/bureaus of the people's governments of various provinces and cities under the unified leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. The Higher Education Department of the Central Government is responsible for the unified guidance of secondary specialized education work nationwide. The decision also requires relevant central business departments to select a portion of their affiliated schools that have achieved success and request the Higher Education Department of the Central Government to issue charters for secondary specialized schools. Schools that have officially obtained charters should resolutely implement them and pay attention to summarizing experience for promotion. Secondary specialized schools that do not yet fully possess the ability to implement this charter may partially implement it according to the actual situation and actively create conditions for full implementation.

    The decision stipulates that the establishment and closure of secondary specialized schools shall be proposed by the competent business department, submitted to the Higher Education Department of the Central Government, and then submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval.

    中央人民政府政务院发出改进中等专业教育的决定
    中央人民政府政务院在九月二十六日发出关于改进中等专业教育的决定。决定中说：中等专业学校在调整、整顿和改革工作中已取得了相当大的成绩，各类中等专业学校（不包括中等师范学校）逐步转归有关业务部门领导，开始按照国民经济各部门的需要及专业化的原则来培养干部，多数学校设置了专业，并开始按照新的教学计划及教学大纲进行教学，从而确立了新的中等专业教育制度的基础。但目前中等专业教育的状况和国家建设发展的要求还不相适应，工作中还存在着很多问题，主要是培养干部工作的计划性不够，学习苏联先进经验推行教学改革还做得不够，学校政治思想领导一般还很薄弱，学校领导多头等。这些缺点极大地影响了培养干部的质量。决定指出：今后中等专业教育应大力整顿并作有计划的发展，巩固已有的成绩，克服各项缺点，特别应注意确定学习年限，进一步明确领导关系，加强领导，努力学习苏联先进经验，积极改进教学，以提高教学的质量。
    决定指出：中等专业学校必须十分重视生产教学（包括教学实习和生产实习）以加强教学中理论和实际的联系。中等专业学校教学实习和生产实习的时间应占理论教学时间的百分之二十五至三十五。中等专业学校必须大力纠正理论脱离实际的教学方法，注意培养学生独立工作能力。中等专业学校校长必须加强校内的统一领导，减少不必要的课外活动，以保证教学计划的实现。
    决定中关于各类中等专业学校的学习年限规定为：工业性质中等专业学校为三至四年，农、林、医药及其他中等专业学校为三年，计划、经济及会计中等专业学校为二年半至三年。业余的中等专业夜校应按同类正规中等专业学校的学习年限增加一年至二年。
    关于改进教学工作，决定中规定了制定和修订教学计划及教学大纲的原则，在学年过程中随意改变教学计划和教学大纲的现象，应予纠正；现行不完整的及过渡性的教学计划，亦应逐渐废除。
    为加强中等专业学校的领导，决定规定：在中央人民政府高等教育部统一领导下，各类中等专业学校都归中央各有关业务部门主管。为增强领导工作效率，原则上中央各有关业务部门应对所属中等专业学校实行集中统一的直接领导。中等农业学校及中等医药学校，由于学校数目过多而专业数目较少，目前可以实行在中央人民政府农业部及卫生部的统一领导下，由各省、市人民政府农林厅、局、卫生厅、局分别直接管理的办法。中央高等教育部负责统一指导全国中等专业教育方面的工作。决定还要求中央有关业务部门，应在所属学校中选择一部分办有成绩者，提请中央高等教育部发给中等专业学校章程。凡正式取得章程的学校应坚决贯彻执行，并注意总结经验，以便推广。凡目前尚未具备完全执行此项章程的中等专业学校，可根据实际情况，部分地执行，并积极创造条件，以便全部执行此项章程。
    决定规定中等专业学校的设置和停办，由主管业务部门提经中央高等教育部转呈政务院批准。　（新华社）
