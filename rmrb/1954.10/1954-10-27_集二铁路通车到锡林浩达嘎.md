The Jining-Eren Railway, which runs from Jining in our country to Ulaanbaatar in the Mongolian People's Republic, has been opened to the Xilinhaote station, 196.5 kilometers beyond the Wundurmiao station on the Chinese side of the border, this month on the 17th.

The Jining-Eren railway project is under intense construction, and as the track-laying progresses, the distance traveled by trains is constantly extending forward. From August of last year to September of this year, a large amount of steel rails, fittings, ballast, cement, timber, sleepers, fuel, food, and living supplies for tens of thousands of workers were transported on the opened sections of the railway, ensuring an ample supply of engineering materials. At the same time, in order to meet the demands of the people in the grasslands along the route as early as possible and to further increase the enthusiasm of people of all ethnic groups along the way for supporting the new railway project, the opened sections have also undertaken local passenger and freight transportation since December 25th of last year. The release of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué has further encouraged the people building the grasslands. Thousands of employees in the temporary management department have unanimously expressed their determination to do a good job in winter transportation, ensuring that "where the tracks are laid, the material supply is there," so that the train can reach Eren as soon as possible.

    集二铁路通车到锡林浩达嘎
    从我国集宁到蒙古人民共和国乌兰巴托的铁路在中国境内的集（宁）二（连）线，于本月十七日越过温都尔庙站通车至一百九十六·五公里的锡林浩达嘎站。
    集二线铁路工程正在紧张施工，随着铺轨工程的进展，火车行驶里程正不断向前延伸。从去年八月起至今年九月，在已通车的铁路上运送了大批的钢轨、配件、道碴、水泥、木材、枕木、燃料、食粮及数万名工人的生活供应品，保证了工程材料的充足供应。同时，为了及早地满足沿线草原上的人们对铁路的要求，更进一步提高沿途各族人民对支援新线铁路工程的热情，从去年十二月二十五日起通车地段还承受了当地的客货运输。自中苏会谈公报公布后，更加鼓舞了建设草原的人们。临时管理部门数千名职工一致表示要做好冬季运输工作，保证“钉道钉到那里、材料供应到那里”，让火车早日通到二连。（刘难先）
