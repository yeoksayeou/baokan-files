    To Complete the Plan
    Wang Shichang, Ma Yi

    Editor's Note: The Communist Party of China (CPC) Hegang City Dongshan Vertical Shaft Work Zone Branch, when encountering difficulties in completing the national plan, conducted multi-faceted and in-depth investigations and research to identify the reasons for the failure to complete the plan. It simultaneously urged the administrative side to solve specific problems and led the trade union and the Communist Youth League to conduct extensive political and ideological work among the masses, mobilizing the entire party and all workers to overcome difficulties and ensure the completion of the plan. This is a good example of how a factory or mine branch can guarantee and promote production. This style of going deep into reality and deep into the masses is worth promoting.

    The Hegang Coal Mine Dongshan Vertical Shaft project is scheduled to be completed and handed over to production in 1954. All well-building workers are striving towards this goal. However, the tunneling task in the first quarter of this year was completed very poorly, with only 80 percent of the task completed in March. What was the reason? The workers said: "There are not enough carriages, and the rock that is blasted down cannot be transported out!" The administrative leaders believe that the hook-up workers are not skilled enough, and the rock underground cannot be transported out, which affects the tunneling task. The trade union agreed with the workers' opinions and asked the administration to increase transportation equipment. Everyone believes that transportation work affects the completion of the tunneling task. But where is the key to whether transportation can be completed, no one knows. In order to thoroughly clarify this issue, the CPC Hegang City Dongshan Vertical Shaft Work Zone Branch organized a joint inspection team to conduct investigations and research at the sites of various work types, including hook-up, transportation, tunneling, and blasting.

    After preliminary investigation, many problems that everyone had not noticed before were discovered: The arrester of the winch did not match the winch. The winch was 150 horsepower, but the arrester was 75 horsepower. Therefore, the winch could only exert 75 horsepower of transportation efficiency. Many tunneling faces were eager to load rock onto the carriages but did not have carriages available. Some tunneling faces that were still drilling holes and did not need to load carriages had a backlog of many carriages. The transportation workers also had low morale, pushing the carriages forward step by step. Why did these phenomena occur? Everyone was still confused. The branch decided to further explore the reasons for the masses' thinking. The branch secretary, branch committee members, administrative cadres, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres went deep into the masses to understand the masses' thoughts through methods such as holding forums and individual conversations. In this way, the problems were further exposed: Some tunneling workers lacked an overall perspective. In order to make it convenient for themselves to use carriages, they seized some carriages before it was time to load them. The places that really needed carriages did not have carriages available. Transportation workers were dissatisfied with or even tired of their work. They asked the branch: "Is there an end to our pushing carriages?" According to activists, some people came to the mine to earn more money. The administrative aspect's commendation and reward of shortcomings in the work also affected the transportation workers' morale. Some people said: "There is no merit in transportation work. Completing the task is the responsibility of tunneling and blasting, and failing to complete the task is the responsibility of transportation." The branch committee studied these problems and believed that the key was that there were problems with transportation management and the allocation of carriages was unreasonable. At the same time, incorrect thinking among the workers also hindered the rational use of carriages and affected the turnover of carriages. The branch decided to carry out work in the following two aspects: On the one hand, it suggested that the administration implement a rational carriage allocation system and transfer workers supported by the masses to be carriage allocation personnel; on the other hand, it instructed the party group leaders and the trade union and Communist Youth League organizations to carry out overall ideological education for workers from all aspects. The branch also called on party members to take the lead in implementing the administrative carriage allocation system. At the same time, it urged the administration to appropriately increase equipment under possible conditions. Through multi-faceted efforts, the transportation problems in tunneling work were successfully resolved, ensuring the construction task.

    The No. 1 South Groove Main Tunnel is the vital passage connecting the vertical shaft area with the southern coal mining area. After the vertical shaft is handed over to production, all the coal in the entire southern coal mining area must be transported through here to the wellbore and then hoisted to the ground. However, the tunneling work on this roadway in the past was particularly backward, and 500 meters were still not completed by the end of March. If we look at the progress of 30 to 40 meters per month in the first quarter, it would take until April 1955 to complete it. Thus, accelerating the tunneling progress of the South Main Tunnel became the key issue in the well-building project at that time. In April, the well-building engineering team, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, proposed to launch a monthly 100-meter progress competition in several key tunneling faces belonging to the well-building company. This would increase the tunneling progress by about twice the actual completion figure in March. In the face of hard rock, it is not easy to tunnel even one more meter, and the difficulty of the monthly 100-meter task can be imagined. However, in order to complete the plan, the monthly 100-meter task cannot be shaken. The branch submitted this arduous task to the party members' meeting for discussion and included it in the resolution of the party members' meeting.

    In order to complete the plan, the administrative leaders of the vertical shaft area transferred a group of key personnel to form a rapid tunneling team to undertake the tunneling task in the South Main Tunnel. Considering the arduousness of the task, the branch first talked to the transferred party members, encouraging them to overcome difficulties without fear of hardship. The branch studied the situation of this new rapid tunneling team, predicted that the key members of each working face might be concentrated together, and it is likely to cause individual heroism and disunity which would affect the completion of the task, so it instructed the trade union: First of all, workers should be given solidarity education. According to the instructions of the Party, the trade union understood the workers' thoughts. Sure enough, some workers said: "This time, heroes and models are all together, let's see who is the real hero and who is the fake hero!" Some people asked: "These people were all group leaders in the past, who will be the group leader this time?" and so on. The trade union criticized these thoughts, and pointed out to everyone that whether the South Main Tunnel can be completed on time is the key to whether the entire vertical shaft can be handed over to production according to plan. It called on everyone to unite and help each other, create good production conditions for the next shift, and work together to complete this glorious task.

    The working conditions in the South Main Tunnel are very poor. Some workers who were transferred there not long ago wavered, disliked the hard work, and asked to be transferred back. In order to ensure the completion of the South Main Tunnel tunneling task according to plan, the vertical shaft area administrative leadership took a series of measures to give priority to the South Main Tunnel in terms of technical equipment. This in turn caused dissatisfaction among the workers on other working faces. Some workers asked the cadres: "The South Main Tunnel task is important, is it okay if we don't complete the task?" Some workers took their anger out on the South Main Tunnel workers, and whenever they met, they sarcastically said: "You eat the dry food, and you have to let us drink some thin soup!" Some workers in the South Main Tunnel also shouted: "We have put a lot of effort into the South Main Tunnel, suffered a lot, and we still have to listen to sarcastic remarks, what's the point!" "I won't work on this working face anymore, I can't stand the anger." This mood directly affected the tunneling progress, and one day only more than two meters were tunneled (more than three meters should have been completed). After the branch discovered this situation, on the one hand, it convened a meeting of party group leaders in the South Main Tunnel to arrange for checking and criticizing the mood of being uneasy with work; on the other hand, branch committee members went deep into the site to talk to workers who were uneasy with work, encouraging them to work actively. The branch also instructed the trade union to strengthen the overall concept education of workers on each working face in the entire vertical shaft area. After this series of work, an atmosphere of supporting the South Main Tunnel was formed in the entire area. The workers all automatically gave way to the South Main Tunnel to use the carriages first; the sarcastic remarks were no longer heard. According to the instructions of the branch, the trade union organized various departments to sign contact contracts with the South Main Tunnel: The transportation team guaranteed the supply of carriages; the mechanical and electrical team guaranteed the work of wind power supply and tool repair. At the same time, workers on each working face were mobilized to write letters to workers in the South Main Tunnel, encouraging them to complete the task. The workers in the South Main Tunnel also expressed that they would definitely complete the task of making 100 meters per month. In the first twenty days of April, the South Main Tunnel completed 70 meters of tunneling. This was a major harvest. At this time, the branch committee proposed a new mobilization slogan at the party members' meeting: "Advance 110 meters per month as a gift for the 'May 1st' Labor Day". After discussion by the party members, it was believed that this slogan was practical, but the problems of insufficient wind power supply and untimely repair of tools must be solved. The branch added these problems to the April party members' meeting resolution, and assigned special personnel to be responsible for supervising the implementation. According to the resolution of the party members' meeting, the trade union organized workers to discuss and turn the Party's resolution into the actual actions of all workers. Under the education and encouragement of the Party, all the workers created a new record of 111 meters of tunneling in April.

    为了完成计划
    王世昌　马义
    编者按：中共鹤岗市东山竖井工区支部，在完成国家计划遇到困难的时候，进行多方面的深入的调查研究，找出不能完成计划的原因，一面督促行政方面解决具体问题，一面领导工会和青年团在群众中进行广泛的政治思想工作，动员全党和全体工人的力量去克服困难，保证完成计划。这是厂矿支部如何保证和推动生产的一个好例子。这种深入实际深入群众的作风是值得提倡的。
    鹤岗煤矿东山竖井工程按计划要在一九五四年内完工并移交生产。全体建井工人都在为这个目标而奋斗。可是，今年第一季度的掘进任务完成得很不好，三月份仅完成了任务的百分之八十。什么原因呢？工人们说是：“车皮不够，崩下来的岩石装不出去！”行政领导干部认为：登钩的工人技术不熟练，井下的岩石运送不出来，影响了掘进任务。工会同意工人的意见，要求行政增加运输设备。大家都认为是运输工作影响了掘进任务的完成。可是到底运输能否完成关键在哪里呢，谁也弄不清楚。为了彻底弄清这个问题，中共鹤岗市东山竖井工区支部组织了一个联合检查组，分别深入到登钩、运搬、掘进和发?各工种现场进行调查研究。
    经过初步调查，发现了许多大家原来没有注意到的问题：绞车的抑制器和绞车不相适应，一百五十马力的绞车，抑制器却是七十五马力的，因此，绞车只能发挥七十五马力的运输效率；有不少掘进工作面急于将岩石装车却没有车皮可用；有些正在打眼还不需要装车的工作面，却积压着许多车皮；运搬工人劳动情绪也不高，推着车子一步一步往前挪。为什么会发生这些现象呢，大家还是搞不清楚。支部决定进一步探索群众思想方面的原因。支部书记、支部委员、行政干部和工会、青年团干部等都深入到群众中去用开座谈会和个别谈话等办法了解群众的思想情况。这样，问题便进一步暴露出来了：有些掘进工人缺乏整体观念，为了自己用车方便，还不到装车的时候，就抢占了一些车皮，真正需要车皮的地方反倒没车皮可用了；运搬工人不满意甚至厌烦他们的工作。他们问支部：“我们推车还有头没有？”据积极分子们谈到，有些人来矿山就是为了多挣点钱。行政方面表扬奖励工作中的缺点也影响了运搬工人的情绪。有人就说：“运搬工作有过没功，完成任务是掘进和发?的，完不成任务是运搬的。”支部委员会研究了这些问题，认为关键在于运输管理有问题，车皮分配不合理。同时，工人中的不正确思想也妨碍了合理使用车皮，影响了车皮的周转。支部决定从以下两方面进行工作：一方面建议行政实行合理的配车制度，并抽调为群众拥护的工人作配车员；另一方面指示党小组长和工会、青年团组织，从各方面对工人进行整体思想教育。支部并号召党员带头贯彻执行行政的配车制度。同时，督促行政在可能的条件下，适当的增加设备。经过多方面的努力，顺利地解决了掘进工作中的运输问题，保证了建设任务。
    南一槽大巷是竖井区与南部采煤区贯通的咽喉要道。竖井移交生产后，整个南部采煤区的煤都要经过这里运到井筒而后提升到地面上来。但是这条巷道过去的掘进工作却特别落后，到三月末还差五百公尺没有完成任务。假如根据第一季度每月前进三、四十公尺的进度来看，需要拖到一九五五年四月才能完成。这样，加快南大巷的掘进进度就成为当时建井工程中的关键问题。四月份建井工程队根据苏联专家的建议，提出在建井公司所属几个关键的掘进工作面中开展月进百公尺竞赛。这样就要把掘进进度较三月份实际完成数字提高两倍左右。在坚硬的岩石面前，多掘进一公尺都是不容易的，月进百公尺任务的艰巨就可想而知了。但是，为了完成计划，对月进百公尺的任务是不能动摇的。支部把这项艰巨的任务提交党员大会讨论，并订在党员大会决议中去。
    为了完成计划，竖井区的行政领导方面，抽调了一批骨干组成快速掘进队，到南大巷担任掘进任务。支部考虑到任务的艰巨，首先找被抽调的党员谈话，鼓励他们不怕艰苦战胜困难。支部研究了这个新的快速掘进队的情况，预计到各工作面的骨干分子集中到一起，很可能闹个人英雄主义，闹不团结而影响任务的完成，于是指示工会：首先要向工人进行团结教育。工会根据党的指示，了解了工人的思想情况，果然，有的工人说：“这回英雄、模范都到一起了，看看谁是真英雄，谁是假英雄！”有的人问：“这些人过去都是组长，这回谁当组长呢？”等等。工会批判了这些思想，并向大家指出：南大巷能否按时完工，是整个竖井能否按计划移交生产的关键。号召大家团结互助，互相给下班创造好的生产条件，共同努力完成这一光荣任务。
    南大巷的劳动条件很不好。有些工人调到那里不久就动摇了，嫌活累，要求调回。为了保证按计划完成南大巷掘进任务，竖井区行政领导方面采取了一系列措施，在技术设备等方面优先支援了南大巷。这样一来，又引起别的工作面工人的不满。有的工人问干部说：“南大巷任务重要，我们完不成任务行不行？”有些工人就拿南大巷工人出气，一见面就冷讽热嘲地说：“你们吃干的，也得叫咱喝点稀的呀！”南大巷有些工人也喊起来：“咱们在南大巷出力不小，吃苦不少，还得听风凉话，何苦呢！”“说啥也不在这个工作面干啦，气受不了。”这种情绪直接影响了掘进进度，有一天仅掘进二公尺多（应完成三公尺多）。支部发现这种情况后，一方面召集南大巷的党小组长开会，布置检查、批判不安心工作的情绪；另方面支部委员们深入现场找不安心工作的工人谈话，鼓励他们积极工作。支部并指示工会，加强对全竖井区各工作面工人的整体观念教育。经过这一系列的工作，在全区形成了支援南大巷的气氛。工人们都自动地把车皮让给南大巷先用；风凉话也听不到了。工会又根据支部的指示，组织各部门与南大巷订立联系合同：运输班保证供应车皮；机电班保证风力供应和工具修理的工作。同时发动各工作面工人给南大巷工人写信，鼓励他们完成任务。南大巷工人也都表示一定完成月进百公尺的任务。四月份的头二十天，南大巷就完成了七十公尺的掘进任务。这是个重大的收获。这时，支委会在党员大会上提出：“月进一百一十公尺，为‘五一’节献礼”的新的动员口号。经过党员们的讨论，认为这个口号是切实可行的，但是必须解决风力供应不足和修理工具不及时的问题。支部把这些问题补充到四月份的党员大会决议中去，责成专人负责监督执行。工会根据党员大会的决议，组织工人讨论，把党的决议变成全体工人的实际行动。全体工人在党的教育和鼓舞下，四月份创造了月进一百一十一公尺的掘进新纪录。
