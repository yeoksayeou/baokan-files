Late Autumn Crops Growing Well in Disaster Areas of Dongting Lake Basin
Disaster-stricken Farmers Along the Lake Actively Engage in Fishing as a Sideline

In the disaster areas of the Dongting Lake basin in Hunan, the 1.8 million mu of late autumn crops, including sweet potatoes, buckwheat, late rice, and ratooning rice, which were replanted after drainage, are generally growing well. Sweet potatoes are currently growing, buckwheat is in bloom, late rice is generally flowering and setting grain, and some are nearing maturity and will be harvested in early November. Ratooning rice has already begun to be harvested. From October 12th to 15th, Nanxian County harvested more than 1,000 mu of its 2 million mu of ratooning rice. Generally, each mu yields 50-60 jin of grain, and the best yields are over 100 jin per mu. Tan Shaohua, the mutual aid team leader of Jianzhong Township in the first district of the county, harvested 1.5 dan of grain from his two mu of ratooning rice. Although the waterlogging disaster in Shima Township in the third district was very serious, Yang Hai'an, a member of a mutual aid team, also harvested 1.2 dan of grain from his three mu of ratooning rice. While harvesting ratooning rice, the masses of farmers paid attention to careful harvesting and threshing. (Our Hunan reporter station)

Disaster victims in the Dongting Lake basin are developing sideline production, focusing on fishing. Most breached dikes have been equipped with barriers and "treading traps," and fishing production is being carried out intensively. In the Changde area, 89 breached dikes in lakeside counties have been equipped with traps, and more than 30,000 dan of fish have already been caught. According to incomplete statistics from Xiangyin, Wangcheng, and Yueyang counties in the Xiangtan area, more than 1.3 million jin of fish have been caught. Judging from the fishing situation in various places, the water is receding slowly this year, and the fish are staying for a long time. Therefore, fish production is generally abundant. According to statistics from four districts in Xiangyin, 300,000 jin of fish were caught in an area of 150,000 mu. According to statistics from Huarong, more than 50,000 people are using nets to fish, and they can catch more than 152,000 jin of fish in one day. Generally, each person can earn an income of 5,000 to 10,000 yuan per day, which has played a significant role in solving the production and livelihood difficulties of the disaster victims.

    洞庭湖滨受灾地区晚秋作物生长良好
    沿湖受灾农民积极进行捕鱼的副业生产
    湖南洞庭湖滨受灾地区，排涝补种的一百八十万亩番薯、荞麦、晚稻、再生稻等晚秋作物，一般生长良好。现红薯正在成长，荞麦已经开花，晚稻普遍扬花结实，有的已近黄熟，十一月上旬即可开始收割。再生稻已开始收割，从十月十二日到十五日的四天中，南县全县的两百万亩再生稻已收割了一千多亩，一般每亩收谷五、六十斤，好的一亩收到一百斤以上。该县一区建衷乡互助组长谭少华的两亩再生稻，收了一石五斗谷；三区石马乡渍灾很严重，但互助组员杨海安的三亩再生稻，也收了一石二斗谷。农民群众在收割稻荪中，注意了细收细打。（本报湖南记者站）

    洞庭湖滨地区灾民正在开展以捕鱼为主的副业生产。大部溃垸缺口，都已作好了拦帘“踩籀”工作，紧张进行捕鱼生产。常德专区滨湖各县已有八十九个溃垸踩好了籀，现已捕鱼三万多担，湘潭专区据湘阴、望城、岳阳三县不完全统计，已捕鱼一百三十多万斤。从各地捕鱼情况来看，今年水退的慢，鱼停留时间长，因此鱼产一般丰富，湘阴四个区统计，在十五万亩面积里，捕鱼三十万斤。华容统计投入用网打鱼的五万多人，一天即可打鱼十五万二千多斤，一般平均每人每天可得五千元到一万元的收入，对解决灾民生产和生活上的困难，起了很大的作用。（徐正斋）
