Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 12th: On the morning of October 11th, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began to simultaneously examine two independent items on its agenda:
    “The question of regulation, limitation and balanced reduction of all armed forces and armaments – Report of the Disarmament Commission” and “On the conclusion of an international convention (treaty) on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction” (this item was included in the General Assembly agenda following a motion by the Soviet delegation).
    The British and French representatives presented their previously expressed opinions on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and raised many questions regarding what they called unclear points in the Soviet proposal.
    British representative Lloyd's speech was mainly a general discussion of the Anglo-French disarmament proposals contained in the British memorandum of May 21, 1954, and the Anglo-French memorandum of June 11, 1954.
    French representative Moch expressed hope that the Soviet proposals would make it possible to adopt a "mutually agreed program" before the end of the year. At the same time, Moch avoided directly discussing the Soviet proposals and only raised a series of questions about them.
    Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky spoke at the afternoon meeting of the Political Committee, elaborating in detail the Soviet position on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and answering the speeches of the British and French representatives.
    Vyshinsky began his speech by drawing attention to the tendency of the British and French representatives: to raise as many questions as possible about the Soviet proposal in order to obtain affirmative or negative answers to these questions. At the same time, the British and French representatives did not express any willingness to revise their previous positions on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
    Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation was willing to answer any questions related to the issue under discussion and to study any suggestions related to this issue.
    It is justified to ask questions, and one cannot but welcome questions that must be clarified.
    But this does not mean that only certain questions are justified, that is, those questions that the questioner is willing to raise, because one must understand that it is impossible for only one side to raise questions here. One must never think that some people can ask questions, and other people must answer these questions, and must answer them exactly in the way that the questioner expects them to, and not in any other way. I am willing to admit that since questions are being asked of me, I must answer them. At the same time, I naturally expect that my counterparts will also believe that when I ask them questions, they must also answer them.
    Vyshinsky emphasized that it would be wrong to assume that the proposals submitted by the Soviet Union to the current session of the United Nations General Assembly were the first step taken by the Soviet Union since the founding of the United Nations to resolve the issue under discussion; it would also be wrong to assume that the Soviet Union had never tried to reconcile its views with those of other countries. The Soviet Union has always insisted, and still insists, that the United Nations General Assembly must take resolute steps to eliminate the threat of a new world war and prevent the danger of new disasters. The Soviet representative gave a detailed overview of the Soviet Union's struggle for disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.
    The French representative had raised a question about the fact that the Soviet proposal did not mention a world disarmament conference. In response to this question, Vyshinsky recounted that the Soviet Union had more than once proposed holding such a conference, specifically on January 28, 1954, at the Berlin Conference.
    For this reason, I think that the question raised by Mr. Moch in this regard cannot in fact be regarded as a question to clarify our attitude, because our attitude is clear. We have been talking about this year after year, demanding this. We are fighting for the adoption of such a decision. And so far, we have never received sympathy. Perhaps the situation has now changed, and our colleagues will agree that such a conference must also be convened. If this is the case, then it is worth looking at the documents that we all must know in order to clearly understand the Soviet Union's position on this issue.
    Vyshinsky continued, saying that the Soviet Union's proposal on the issue under discussion was a very consistent action, fully in line with the entire trend of its peaceful foreign policy, the foundation of which is the important principle of peaceful coexistence between countries.
    The Soviet representative pointed out that if the People's Republic of China participated in drafting appropriate measures, it would greatly contribute to the resolution of the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The importance of the People's Republic of China on the issue of war and peace cannot be overestimated.
    In submitting the September 30th proposal, the Soviet government was based on the premise that the Anglo-French proposals of June 11th this year, if amended, would not conflict with the principles upheld by the Soviet government on the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and reducing armaments.
    In its memorandum of September 22nd this year, in response to the US memorandum of July 9th, the Soviet government pointed out that if the US government, like the Soviet government, was eager to reduce the threat of war and alleviate the burden of armaments, the goal of the two governments' efforts should be to strive to reach an agreement on prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing strict international supervision to implement this prohibition, as well as an agreement on substantially reducing conventional armaments.
    I have said that the Soviet government has repeatedly made such proposals to the United Nations.
    What is the starting point of the Soviet government? The starting point of the Soviet government is the premise that such proposals are in line with the increasingly high demands of the people of all countries, who hope to end the arms race (including the atomic arms race) and hope to take urgent measures to relieve mankind of the threat of a destructive atomic war.
    In the aforementioned memorandum of September 22nd this year to the US government, the Soviet government pointed out that although it has not been possible to reach such an agreement until now, the importance of the efforts of the countries concerned to reach an understanding on this issue should not be reduced in any way.
    As everyone knows, the correctness of such an attitude has been confirmed by the Geneva Conference. At the same time, this conference also proved that consultations between countries are effective. But under what circumstances?
    It is in the case where countries are truly concerned about consolidating peace and international security, because this can produce important positive results, and can also help solve many other very important problems in Asia and Europe. I think this is now completely certain.
    The Soviet government, following this path, believed that it could propose its own new proposals on reducing the armaments of various countries and on the atomic issue based on the Anglo-French proposals of June 11, 1954—this is now known to everyone.
    This is the source of this proposal. This explains why we are willing to take the Anglo-French proposals of June 11, 1954, as a basis.
    I must also explain that although the Soviet government did not say that the implementation of the plan stipulated in this proposal depended on countries reaching an agreement to unconditionally renounce the use of atomic weapons (which we have always insisted on), as a major step towards completely prohibiting atomic weapons and eliminating this weapon from national armaments, it still believes that reaching such an agreement is of great significance for promoting and accelerating the implementation of all the measures stipulated in our draft convention.
    The Soviet government believes that such an agreement is all the more necessary because the destructive power of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons is becoming increasingly great—people should never close their eyes to this fact.
    At the same time, I cannot but point out that the atomic merchants are sparing no effort to promote the power of this "destructive force," emphasizing the so-called superiority of the United States in this regard, and boasting about the extremely sensational plans to apply this destructive force to the use of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. This is to stir up and instigate war hysteria, and to heat up the political atmosphere to the point where it is increasingly dangerous to the cause of peace.
    It is no accident that the extremely wasteful and worthless publications that flood the markets of Western European countries, especially the United States, serve this erroneous and dangerous policy. For example, the recently published book "The Hydrogen Bomb" does not have a single page in its two hundred and thirty-five pages that does not praise the destructive power of nuclear weapons.
    Vyshinsky continued, saying that I have already said that the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union is based on the Anglo-French proposal of June 11, 1954. I also pointed out that the convention (treaty) should include all the main provisions of this proposal. Analyzing these provisions, it can be seen that these provisions are consistent with the corresponding Anglo-French proposals of June 11, 1954, on all major issues.
    Speaking of the differences between the Soviet proposal and the Anglo-French proposals, Vyshinsky said that in terms of reducing military appropriations, the Soviet proposal stipulates that, along with the armed forces, military appropriations should be reduced in two stages, each time by 50 percent. The Anglo-French proposals do not mention reducing military appropriations.
    Turning to the French representative, Vyshinsky reminded him that the term "agreed quotas" was borrowed from the Anglo-French proposal of June 11th. Vyshinsky went on to say, "By the way, this proposal does not mention levels. I can now ask Mr. Moch and Mr. Lloyd: 'Please explain, how is it that you talk about agreed quotas in your June 11th proposal, but you don't mention levels?' Is it because you think it is unwise and inappropriate to insist on this, and that you should explore new ways to reach agreed quotas, that is, quotas agreed upon by both parties?"
    I would like to urge you to take this path. We agree with this path. We hope that you will not deepen the differences when elaborating on your suggestions, but rather strive to eliminate all possible differences in the future, all unimportant things that can lead to differences, and put forward everything that is important and can lead to agreements. Vyshinsky continued, saying that as for the dates for reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons, the Soviet proposal already has sufficiently clear provisions. In the Anglo-French proposals, these dates are not clearly specified, and are left to be determined by the declarations of the supervisory agencies.
    Speaking of the establishment of the supervisory agency and whether the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction should be carried out simultaneously, the Soviet representative recounted that in the past, some people had insisted that the supervisory agency should be established first, and then atomic weapons should be prohibited, while others insisted that the prohibition of atomic bombs should come first, and the establishment of the supervisory committee should come later. The Soviet government proposes to simultaneously prohibit atomic weapons and establish a permanent supervisory agency. Unlike the Anglo-French proposals, the Soviet proposal stipulates that the complete prohibition of atomic weapons and the elimination of these weapons from national armaments should be carried out in parallel with the work of reducing conventional armaments by 50 percent of the agreed quotas.
    Regarding the Soviet proposal to establish an international supervisory committee in the first stage of reducing armaments, and then to establish a permanent international supervisory agency when reducing half of the quotas agreed upon by everyone in the second stage, Vyshinsky explained as follows:
    We must never ignore the fact that the establishment of a supervisory agency is not only to supervise conventional armaments, but also to supervise atomic production, and at the same time as establishing this agency, a decision will be made to stop the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and to eliminate these weapons from national armaments. Before this step is taken, that is, before there is only one task left—to monitor the implementation of the obligations undertaken by the governments of various countries in reducing armaments and armed forces—an international supervisory committee with the aforementioned powers should carry out its work, as suggested in the Soviet proposal.
    Vyshinsky concluded by saying that in submitting the proposal based on the Anglo-French proposals, the Soviet delegation hoped that this would lead to the path of success that all peace-loving people so eagerly await, and that other delegations would follow this path, so that together with the Soviet Union and some other member states of the United Nations, they could strive to reach a mutually agreed decision on important contemporary international issues such as those addressed in our September 30th proposal on consolidating peace and international security. This task is an extremely important and extremely urgent task, which concerns the vital interests of the people of all countries and of all mankind. The time has come to recognize this and act accordingly. We hope that the Political Committee will successfully handle this important task.

    联大政委会开始讨论苏联关于裁军的提案
    维辛斯基详细说明苏联裁军建议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：十月十一日上午，联合国大会政治委员会开始同时审查它的议程上的两个独立的项目：
    “规定、限制和均衡地裁减一切武装部队及军备问题——裁减军备委员会的报告书”和“关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约（条约）”（这一项目是按照苏联代表团的动议列入大会议程的）。
    英国代表和法国代表就裁军及禁止原子武器问题提出他们以前表示过的意见，并针对苏联的提案中他们所谓不清楚的地方提出了许多问题。
    英国代表劳埃德的发言基本上是概括地谈论包含在一九五四年五月二十一日的英国备忘录和一九五四年六月十一日的英、法两国备忘录中的英、法两国裁军建议。
    法国代表莫克表示希望苏联建议将会使大家有可能在年底以前通过一个“大家都同意的方案”。同时，莫克避免直接谈论苏联建议，而只是对这一建议提出了一系列的问题。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在政治委员会下午的会议上发言，详细地阐明了苏联关于裁减军备及禁止大规模毁灭性武器的主张，并回答了英国代表及法国代表的发言。
    维辛斯基开始发言时，提请人们注意英国和法国代表的倾向：对苏联提案提出尽可能多的问题以便取得对这些问题的肯定的或否定的答复。同时，英、法两国代表都没有表示有任何意愿要修改他们以前关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性的武器的主张。
    维辛斯基说，苏联代表团愿意回答和讨论中的问题有关的任何问题，愿意研究和这个问题有关的任何建议。
    提问题是正当的，人们不能不欢迎那种必须加以说明的问题。
    但这并不是说，只有某些问题是正当的，也就是发问者愿意提出的那些问题，因为人们必须明白，在这里不可能只有一方面提出问题。人们绝不要以为有些人可以提出问题，其他一些人就必须回答这些问题，并且必须完全按发问者所期望于他们的方式回答，而不是以其他方式回答。我愿意承认，问题既然是向我提出的，我必须回答。同时，我很自然地期望我的对方也会认为，当我向他们提出问题时，他们也必须回答。
    维辛斯基着重指出，如果以为苏联向联合国大会本届会议提出的建议是联合国创立以来苏联谋求解决讨论中的这个问题的第一个步骤，那是错误的；如果认为苏联从来没有设法使自己的观点和其他国家的观点求得调和，那也是错误的。苏联过去一向坚持，现在同样坚持，联合国大会必须采取坚决的步骤，消除新的世界大战的威胁，防止新灾难的危险。苏联代表详尽地综述了苏联所进行过的争取裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的斗争。
    法国代表曾就苏联提案没有提到世界裁军会议的事实提出一个问题，针对着这个问题，维辛斯基追述道，苏联过去曾不止一次地建议举行这样一个会议，具体说，一九五四年一月二十八日在柏林会议上便曾提出过这样建议。
    由于这个缘故，我认为，莫克先生在这方面提出的问题事实上不能看作是一个要弄清我们的态度的问题，因为我们的态度是清楚的。我们一年又一年地谈论这一点，要求这一点。我们正在为争取通过这样一个决定而奋斗。而到目前为止，我们始终没有得到同情。也许现在情况已经有了变化，我们的同事们会同意必须也召开这样的会议。如果是这样的话，那就值得看看我们大家都一定知道的文件以便清楚地了解苏联在这个问题上的主张。
    维辛斯基继续说，苏联就讨论中的问题提出的建议是一个前后十分一贯的行动，是充分符合它的和平外交政策的整个趋势的，这个政策的基础就是各国和平共处这一重要原则。
    苏联代表指出，如果中华人民共和国参与拟订适当的措施的话，那就会大大有助于裁减军备与禁止原子武器问题的解决。中华人民共和国在战争与和平问题上的重要性是怎么样估计也不为过分的。
    苏联政府在提出九月三十日提案的时候是根据这样一个前提：今年六月十一日的英法建议如果作某些修正，与苏联政府在禁止原子武器和裁减军备问题上所坚持的原则并不冲突。
    苏联政府在答复美国七月九日的备忘录的今年九月二十二日的备忘录里指出，苏联政府认为如果美国政府像苏联政府一样，渴望减少战争威胁，并减轻军备负担的话，两国政府努力的目标应该是争取达成关于禁止原子武器并建立严格国际监督以贯彻这项禁令的协议，以及关于大量裁减常规军备的协议。
    我已经说过，苏联政府曾多次向联合国提出这样的建议。
    苏联政府的出发点是什么呢？苏联政府的出发点是这样一个前提：这样的建议符合各国人民日益高涨的要求，他们希望结束军备竞赛（包括原子军备竞赛），希望采取紧急措施为人类解除毁灭性原子战争的威胁。
    苏联政府在今年九月二十二日致美国政府的上述备忘录中指出，虽然一直到现在都没有能够达成这样一个协议，各有关国家努力来在这个问题上达成谅解的重要性并不应该因此有任何减少。
    大家知道，这样一种态度的正确性已由日内瓦会议得到证实。同时，这个会议还证明各国之间的协商是有效的。但是在什么情况下呢？
    是在这样的情况下：各国真正关心巩固和平与国际安全，因为这能够产生重要的积极结果，而且还能帮助解决亚洲和欧洲的许多其他非常重要的问题。我认为这一点现在是完全确凿无疑的了。
    苏联政府走着这条道路，认为可以以英、法两国一九五四年六月十一日的建议为基础提出自己的关于裁减各国军备和关于原子问题的新建议——这一点现在大家已经知道了。
    这就是这个建议的来源。这说明了我们为什么愿意拿英、法两国一九五四年六月十一日的建议作为基础。
    我还必须说明，虽然苏联政府并没有说这一建议中所规定的计划的实施取决于各国达成无条件地放弃使用原子武器的协议（这是我们一直坚持的），作为走向完全禁止原子武器和从国家军备中取消这种武器的一大步骤，但它仍然认为，达成这样的协议对于促进和加速实施我们的公约草案中规定的一切措施有重大意义。
    苏联政府认为，由于原子武器和氢武器的破坏力愈来愈巨大——对这一事实人们是绝不应该闭起眼睛的——这种协议就更其必要了。
    同时我不能不指出，原子贩子们正在不遗余力地宣传这种“破坏力量”的威力，强调美国在这方面的所谓优势，和大肆吹嘘把这种破坏力量应用于使用原子弹和氢弹的极其耸人听闻的计划，这就是要激起和煽动战争歇斯底里，把政治空气热化到对和平事业愈来愈危险的程度。
    充斥于西欧各国的市场，特别是美国的市场的极其浪费的一文不值的书刊替这种错误和危险的政策效劳，并不是偶然的。例如最近出版的“氢弹”一书在其二百三十五页中没有一页不称颂核子武器的毁灭力量。
    维辛斯基继续说，我已经说过，苏联提出的提案是以一九五四年六月十一日的英、法建议为基础的。我同时还指出，公约（条约）应该包括这个提案的所有主要规定。把这些规定分析一下就可以看出：这些规定在一切主要问题上都是与一九五四年六月十一日英、法两国的相应建议一致的。
    谈到苏联建议与英、法两国建议不同的地方，维辛斯基说，在削减军事拨款方面苏联建议规定，与武装部队一道，军事拨款要分两个阶段削减，每次削减百分之五十。而英、法两国建议没有提到削减军事拨款。
    维辛斯基转向法国代表，提醒他说：“一致同意的定额”一词是从六月十一日的英法建议中借用来的。维辛斯基接着说，顺便提一下，这个建议中却没有提到水平。我现在可以要求莫克先生和劳埃德先生：“请解释一下，你们在你们六月十一日的建议中谈到一致同意的定额，却又没有提到水平，这到底是怎么一回事？”是因为你们认为坚持这一点不明智与不适当，认为应探求新的途径来求得一致同意的定额，也就是双方同意的定额吗？
    我愿意促请你们走这条道路。我们同意这条道路。我们希望你们现在在发挥你们的建议时不致加深分歧，而是努力消除将来的一切可能的分歧、一切不重要而又能引向分歧的东西，而提出一切重要并能引向协议的东西。维辛斯基接着说，至于裁减军备与禁止原子武器的日期，苏联建议中已有充分明白的规定。英、法两国建议里，没有明确规定这些日期，而使这些日期决定于监督机构的声明。
    在讲到监督机构的设立和原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的禁止是否要同时进行时，苏联代表追述说，在过去，有些人曾坚持说应该首先设立监督机构，以后再禁止原子武器，而另外一些人则坚持说，禁止原子弹应该在先，建立监督委员会应该在后。苏联政府建议同时禁止原子武器和设立永久性的监督机构。和英、法两国建议不同，苏联建议完全禁止原子武器和从国家军备中取消这种武器的工作要与把常规军备再削减一致同意的定额的百分之五十的工作平行地进行。
    关于苏联建议在裁减军备第一阶段设立一个国际监督委员会，而在第二阶段再裁减大家同意的定额的一半时，则建立一个永久性的国际监督机构一节，维辛斯基说明如下：
    我们绝不能忽视这一事实：监督机构的设立，不但是为了监督常规军备，而且还是为了监督原子生产，而且在设立这个机构的同时，还将作出一个停止生产原子武器和氢武器并从国家军备中取消这种武器的决定。在做到这一步以前，也就是说在只剩下一个任务——监察各国政府在裁减军备和武装部队方面所承担的义务的履行情况——以前，应该有一个具有上述职权的国际监督委员会进行工作，像苏联提案中所建议的那样。
    维辛斯基最后说，苏联代表团在提出以英、法两国的建议为基础的建议时，是希望这就会引向所有爱好和平人民那么热烈期待的成功的道路，而且其他代表团将随着遵循这条道路，以便和苏联及一些其他的联合国会员国一起，争取在我们九月三十日关于巩固和平和国际安全的提案中所处理的问题那样的当代重要国际问题上达成大家都同意的决定，这个任务是一个极其重要、极其迫切的任务，关系到各国人民、全人类的切身利益，承认这一点并据此行动的时候已经来到。我们希望政治委员会能成功地处理这个重要的任务。
