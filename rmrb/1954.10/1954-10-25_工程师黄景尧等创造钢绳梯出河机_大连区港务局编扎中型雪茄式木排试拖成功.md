Engineer Huang Jingyao and Others Create Steel Rope Ladder River Exit Machine
Dalian Port Authority Successfully Test-Tows Medium-Sized Cigar-Shaped Raft

The steel rope ladder river exit machine created by engineer Huang Jingyao and other comrades of the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau has been successfully tested.

The steel rope ladder river exit machine is designed based on the principle of a conveyor belt. It is shaped like a dragon-bone waterwheel, erected on the riverbank. Manually, timber floating within the river blocking cable is moved to the loading opening of the exit machine. When the machine rotates, the timber can be continuously transported ashore. According to preliminary measurements, at a slow speed of 0.368 meters per second, it can lift 740 to 800 pieces of railroad ties, mine props, or fir cylinders per hour. With a crew of nine workers, it can lift 7,400 to 8,000 pieces of timber per day, equivalent to the workload of over 400 workers, increasing work efficiency by 44 times. If the timber has a small bend and small diameter, the efficiency of lifting timber will be even higher, comparable to the timber lifting efficiency of the Northeast pounding-style river exit machine. The manufacturing cost of this steel rope ladder river exit machine is only 50 million yuan, which is 90 percent lower than the cost of the Northeast river exit machine.

In the winter of 1952, when engineer Huang Jingyao worked at the Hunan Forestry Bureau, he designed and test-produced a river exit machine using flat iron chains. However, because the flat iron chain itself was too heavy, required too much power, and the equipment cost was too high, it was not successfully trial-produced. This year, after engineer Huang Jingyao was transferred to the Hunan Forestry Industry Bureau, he continued his research. With the joint research and assistance of comrades Zou Shengheng, Zhou Sitong, and the workers, after more than three months of trial production and installation, the first test run was successful on September 7.

The Dalian Port Authority of Liaoning Province, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, successfully tested the towing of a medium-sized cigar-shaped raft. This raft is 100 meters long, 17 meters wide in the middle, and has a volume of 3,225 cubic meters. Its loading capacity is equivalent to that of ships over 4,000 tons, and the freight rate is about 35 percent lower than that of steamships.

This year, the volume of maritime timber transportation has greatly increased, but due to insufficient ships, large amounts of timber are often backlogged and cannot be shipped. The Dalian Port Authority, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, successfully tested the towing of a small cigar-shaped raft in May this year. However, the one-time towing capacity of this small cigar-shaped raft was relatively small. In early September, based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in towing "Heilongjiang style" cigar-shaped rafts on the Sea of Okhotsk in 1951, the bureau built another medium-sized cigar-shaped raft and successfully test-towed it. This type of raft carries six to seven times more timber than the small one, uses 35 percent less rigging than the small one, and the transportation cost is much lower than that of the small one. After the medium-sized cigar-shaped raft was successfully built, the test tow began on September 26 and safely arrived in Qingdao on the morning of September 29.

    工程师黄景尧等创造钢绳梯出河机
    大连区港务局编扎中型雪茄式木排试拖成功
    湖南省森林工业局工程师黄景尧等同志创造的钢绳梯出河机试验成功。
    钢绳梯出河机是根据输送带的原理设计的，形状像一架龙骨水车，架设在河岸上，用人工把浮在河面栏河索内的木材，拨到出河机的装材口上，机器一转动，木材就可源源不断的被送到岸上。据初步测定：以每秒钟转○·三六八公尺速度的慢车，每小时可起坡枕木、坑木或杉筒七百四十根到八百根，每班九人操作一天可起坡木材七千四百根到八千根，等于四百多个工人的一天工作量，提高了工作效率四十四倍。如木材弯度小，径级小，起坡木材的效率则更高，可赶上东北捣练式出河机起坡木材的效率。这部钢绳梯出河机制造费仅五千多万元，比东北出河机成本降低百分之九十。
    在一九五二年冬天，黄景尧工程师在湖南林业局工作时，曾设计用扁铁链试制一部出河机，但因扁铁链本身太笨重，需要动力大，设备费太贵，未能试制成功。今年黄景尧工程师调到湖南森林工业局工作后，又继续进行研究，在邹升恒、周四通等同志和工人们的共同研究和帮助下，经过三个多月的试制和安装，在九月七日第一次试车成功。

    辽宁省大连区港务局学习苏联先进经验，试拖中型雪茄式木排成功。这种木排身长一百公尺，中宽十七公尺，体积为三千二百二十五立方公尺。它的装载量等于四千吨以上的船只，比轮船运费率低百分之三十五左右。
    今年海上的木材运输量大大增加，但因船只不足，常常使大量的木材积压，不能启运。大连区港务局学习了苏联先进经验，于今年五月间试拖小型雪茄式木排获得成功，但这个小型的雪茄式木排一次拖运量比较小。九月初，该局又根据苏联一九五一年在鄂霍茨克等海上拖运“黑龙江式”雪茄式木排的先进经验，又扎了一只中型雪茄式木排，并试拖成功。这种木排比小型的多装木材六倍到七倍，索具用量比小型的少百分之三十五，运输成本也比小型的低很多。中型雪茄式木排编扎成功后，于九月二十六日开始试拖，至九月二十九日上午安全地到达了青岛。
