    The General Manager of the Soviet-Chinese Nonferrous and Rare Metals Company, Bai Chengming, spoke to reporters regarding the Sino-Soviet communiqué. He expressed his firm support for the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué and his heartfelt gratitude for the sincere and selfless assistance given to our country by the great friendly nation of the Soviet Union. Bai Chengming said: The Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Joint-Stock Company was established not long after our country's liberation, during a period of economic recovery. It has important significance for our country's socialist industrialization, especially in terms of its role in Xinjiang's economic construction. When the company was first established, there was no foundation in any aspect. Thanks to the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet government in terms of capital, production equipment, and technical strength, and under the personal guidance and help of Soviet experts, in just four short years, we have built a large-scale and well-equipped modern industry in the remote mountains and wilderness of Xinjiang. Over the past four years, Soviet experts have helped us carry out large-scale geological surveys in vast areas, identified the reserves of several mining areas, and prepared extremely valuable data for the company's future development. The main minerals currently mined by the company have reached eight types. The total output value in 1953 was 258.6 percent of that in 1951, and this year it is expected to increase to over 320 percent. Not only is the production plan increasing every year, but it is also being overfulfilled every year. In 1953, the production plan was completed by 125 percent; so far this year, three products have completed their annual production plans, and it is expected that all production plans will be overfulfilled. Over the past four years, the investment in basic construction has also been huge, with the construction of employee dormitories alone reaching 20,000 square meters. In order to train a large number of industrial and technical cadres in our country, the company has also established a secondary mining technical school, which currently has 600 students from various ethnic groups. Taking power equipment as an example, the level in 1954 is equal to 304 percent of that in 1952. By 1953, the production process had basically achieved full mechanization. Over the past few years, Soviet experts have helped us train more than 5,000 specialized technical cadres and technicians in more than 370 types of work, including drilling, mining, beneficiation, and machinery. The vast majority of these workers were farmers, herdsmen, and urban poor from various ethnic groups in Xinjiang who lacked industrial and scientific knowledge just four years ago.

    Bai Chengming continued: Soviet staff members in the Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Joint-Stock Company, far away from their own country, came to Xinjiang to help us carry out economic construction. In their work, they overcame the difficulty of language barriers and tried every means to patiently teach all production technologies and experience in all aspects to our Chinese employees without reservation. Whether in the hot summer or the cold winter, they participated in production on high mountains and in mine pits, and provided specific guidance to our Chinese staff. Whenever there were difficulties or arduous tasks, they always stood in the front. In situations with few people and heavy tasks, they often worked day and night. In their work, Soviet staff members conducted research together with our Chinese staff and respected the opinions of our Chinese staff. In particular, they took great care of the workers' health, and many Soviet experts personally inspected the cleanliness and sanitation of the construction sites, safety equipment, and daily diet.

    Bai Chengming concluded: From January 1st next year, all the work of the Sino-Soviet Nonferrous and Rare Metals Joint-Stock Company will be fully undertaken by our Chinese staff. At that time, our responsibility will be even greater. We must follow the methods taught to us by our Soviet friends, and continue to learn Soviet advanced production technology and experience, and learn the creative labor spirit of the Soviet people. We must run our mines and enterprises well, and at the same time strengthen the education of Sino-Soviet friendship among employees, and consolidate and further expand the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    苏有色及稀有金属公司总经理发表谈话
    中苏有色及稀有金属股份公司总经理白成铭就中苏会谈公报向记者发表谈话。他对中苏两国会谈公报表示坚决拥护，并对伟大友邦苏联对我国真诚无私的援助表示衷心感谢。白成铭说：中苏有色及稀有金属股份公司是在我国解放不久、正当经济恢复时期成立的，它对我国社会主义工业化的建设有着重要的意义，尤其对新疆经济建设起的作用更大。公司初建时在各方面都毫无基础，由于苏联政府在资金、生产设备和技术力量等方面的真诚无私的援助，在苏联专家亲自的指导和帮助之下，短短四年中，使我们在新疆人烟稀少、交通不便的深山和荒野修建起了规模宏大和有头等设备的现代化工业。四年来，苏联专家帮助我们在广大的地区进行了大规模的地质勘测工作，探明了若干矿区储量，对公司今后的发展准备了极珍贵的资料。现在公司开采的主要矿产已达八种。生产总值一九五三年为一九五一年的百分之二百五十八点六，今年可增至百分之三百二十以上。生产计划不但每年都在增加，而且年年都超额完成。一九五三年就完成了生产计划的百分之一百二十五；今年到现在已有三种产品完成了全年生产计划，预计全部生产计划也将超额完成。四年来在基本建设中投资也是巨大的，仅修建职工宿舍就达二万平方公尺。为了大量培养我国工业技术干部，公司还创办了中级矿山技术学校一座，现有各族学生六百名。生产设备方面以电力为例，一九五四年就等于一九五二年的百分之三百零四。在一九五三年，生产过程已基本达到全部机械化。几年来苏联专家帮助我们培养了钻探、采矿、选矿、机械等三百七十多种工种的专业技术干部和技术工人五千多名。而这些工人中绝大多数在四年前还是缺乏工业科学知识的新疆各民族农民、牧民以及城市贫民。
    白成铭接着说：中苏有色及稀有金属股份公司里的苏方工作人员远离开自己的祖国，来到新疆帮助我们进行经济建设，他们在工作中克服了语言不通的困难，想尽了各种办法，耐心地把全部生产技术和各方面的经验毫无保留地教给我国职工。无论是在炎热的夏季或严寒的冬天，他们都在高山上和矿坑中参加生产，具体指导我国工作人员，一遇到困难或艰苦的工作，他们总是站在前面。在人少和任务重的情况下他们经常夜以继日地工作。在工作中苏联工作人员都和我国工作人员在一起进行研究，尊重我国工作人员的意见。特别是对于工人健康备加爱护，许多苏联专家亲自检查工地清洁卫生、安全设备和日常饮食。
    白成铭最后说：从明年一月一日起，中苏有色及稀有金属股份公司的一切工作就要由我国工作人员全部担当起来。那时我们的责任就更加重大了。我们一定要按照苏联友人所教给我们的办法，并要继续不断地学习苏联先进生产技术和经验，学习苏联人民创造性的劳动精神，办好我们的矿厂企业，同时在职工中加强中苏友好的教育，巩固和进一步扩大中苏两国人民的伟大友谊。（新华社）
