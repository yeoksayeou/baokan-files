Editor's Note: The "Textbook of Political Economy" published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House was collectively written by Soviet economists Kang V. Ostrovityanov, D.T. Shepilov, L.A. Leontiev, I.D. Laptev, I.I. Kuzminov, L.M. Gatovsky, P.F. Yudin, A.I. Bashkov, V.I. Pereslegin, and others. The book has been translated by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the CPC Central Committee. We are now translating and publishing here an article from "Pravda" introducing the contents of the book.
The Textbook of Political Economy has been published. It gives a popular exposition of the basic problems of proletarian political economy, a component part of Marxist-Leninist theory, and points out its great significance for the revolutionary activities of the working class.

The contents of the Textbook of Political Economy include: Preface, chapters - "Pre-Capitalist Modes of Production," "Capitalist Modes of Production" (pre-monopoly capitalism and monopoly capitalism - imperialism), "Socialist Modes of Production," and Conclusion. Each chapter of the textbook is followed by a brief conclusion.

The preface discusses the object and method of political economy, and clarifies the fundamental difference between proletarian political economy as a true science and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois political economy.

The preface discusses the role played by the great leaders and theorists of the working class, Marx and Engels, as the founders of proletarian political economy. In his classic work "Capital," Marx revealed the laws of the emergence, development, and demise of capitalism, and demonstrated from the economic aspect the inevitability of socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Marx and Engels roughly formulated the doctrines on the period of transition from capitalism to socialism and on the two stages of communist society.

The textbook emphasizes that the brilliant successor of Marx and Engels' cause, V.I. Lenin, creatively developed and enriched Marxist economic doctrines. He summarized the new experience of historical development and founded the Marxist doctrine on imperialism, put forward the main points of the basic economic law of modern capitalism, formulated the basis of the doctrine of the general crisis of capitalism, and created a new theory of socialist revolution, scientifically exploring the basic problems of socialist and communist construction.

Relying on the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, who created the truly scientific political economy, Lenin's great comrade-in-arms and student, J.V. Stalin, put forward and developed a series of new principles of political economy.

Marxist-Leninist economic theory is further developed and enriched in the resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the fraternal Communist Parties, and the works of the leaders of these parties.
	   I

The first part of the textbook explains the economic relations of pre-capitalist modes of production - primitive communal, slave, and feudal. At the same time, it expounds the social ideas of the primitive era and the economic views of the slave and feudal periods.

The textbook explains the state of the productive forces and the nature of the production relations in each of these economic eras. It mentions the role of the law that production relations must be suitable for the nature of the productive forces at various stages of development of pre-capitalist forms.

The authors of the textbook begin their discussion of various socio-economic formations by unfolding the primitive communal system of human social history. In this period, the means of production were primitive, and people could only obtain the means of subsistence by working together. The ownership of the means of production was collective in nature, and products were distributed according to the principle of averaging within small communes.

The textbook guides readers to understand the regularity of the succession of socio-economic formations. With its development, the productive forces come into contradiction with the production relations existing under the primitive communal system. The primitive communal system will inevitably be replaced by another more advanced form. The slave system is a law-governed step forward in the development of human society, which led to further growth of the productive forces. The basis of slave system production relations is the slave owner's complete ownership of the means of production and the slaves.

Human history began to enter the period of class struggle between the exploiting and the exploited classes from the slave mode of production. Due to the division of society into classes, the state appeared, which is an institution for a minority of exploiters to suppress the majority of the exploited in society.

Later, the production relations of the slave system no longer adapted to the growing productive forces, which doomed the inevitable demise of this system.

The authors of the textbook tell how the feudal system arose and replaced the slave mode of production and was established, which opened up new and broad places for the development of social productive forces. The basis of feudal social production relations is the feudal lord's ownership of land and incomplete ownership of the working people - serfs. As time went by, the production relations of feudal society gradually became an obstacle to the development of productive forces. The conflict between the productive forces and production relations in feudal society is the economic basis of the bourgeois revolutions, which ended the feudal system and established the rule of capitalist production relations, which for a certain period of time opened up broad places for the development of productive forces.

The analysis of the economic relations of various forms before capitalism in the textbook illustrates the objective reasons for the demise of outdated modes of production and the inevitability of the victory of other, more progressive modes of production.

Studying the regularity of the development of various forms before capitalism has not only cognitive but also practical significance. In the economies of many nations enslaved by imperialists, feudal relations, and in some places even primitive communal relations, are still preserved to a considerable extent. Recognizing and estimating the objective economic laws of various forms before capitalism can correctly understand the characteristics of the liberation movement in these countries.
II

The second part of the Textbook of Political Economy discusses the economic relations of the capitalist mode of production. It gives a brief review of the economic doctrines of the capitalist era.

The authors introduce the Marxist theory of the capitalist economic system, pointing out that the basis of capitalist production relations is the capitalist private ownership of the means of production. The existence of a class of wage laborers deprived of the means of production is inherent in capitalism.

This chapter tells that Marx created the theory of surplus value and thereby revealed the basic economic law of capitalism, exposing the secrets of capitalist exploitation.

The chapter "The Accumulation of Capital and the Impoverishment of the Proletariat" reveals the contradictions of capitalist accumulation. It cites some factual materials to show the endless growth of wealth in the hands of the bourgeoisie and the uninterrupted process of relative, and absolute impoverization of the working class.

Readers can see in the book how the basic contradiction of capitalism - the contradiction between the social nature of production and the form of private capitalist appropriation - is sharpened in the process of capitalist reproduction. This is most clearly manifested in periodic economic crises and in the intensification of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

This part pays great attention to narrating the historical trend of the development of the capitalist mode of production revealed by Marx. While developing productive forces and socializing production, capitalism creates on the one hand the material premise of socialism, and on the other hand, produces the proletariat as its own gravedigger, this class organizes and leads all the working people to fight for liberation from the shackles of capitalism.

The textbook traces the process of the transformation of pre-monopoly capitalism into imperialism with concrete materials. The authors explain the role played by Lenin in theoretically summarizing the various economic processes of the era of imperialism.

The chapters on imperialism point out that as a result of the action of the basic economic law of modern capitalism, all the major contradictions of imperialism - the contradiction between labor and capital, the contradiction between the imperialist powers vying for world domination, and the contradiction between the suzerain states and the colonies - are dramatically sharpened.

The authors here explain Lenin's law of uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries in the era of imperialism, and Lenin's theory of the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country.

With the development of imperialism, the prerequisites for the general crisis of capitalism gradually accumulate. This crisis occupies an entire historical era, the content of which is the demise of capitalism and the victory of socialism on a worldwide scale. The general crisis of capitalism began during the First World War, and was particularly deepened by the secession of the Soviet Union from the capitalist system.

As a result of the Second World War and the secession of the European and Asian People's Democratic countries from the capitalist system, the second stage of the general crisis began. At this stage, the unified, all-encompassing world capitalist market disintegrated, two parallel markets were established, therefore, the scope of major capitalist countries to exert their power over world resources has been reduced; the imperialist colonial system began to disintegrate. The unevenness of development of capitalist countries has been extremely strengthened, and the militarization of the economy plays an increasingly important role in economic life. In the political aspect, the decay of capitalism is manifested in the strengthening of reaction and the fascistization of the state system.

The consolidation of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, the weakening of the camp of imperialism, and the growth of the liberation struggle of the working people headed by the proletariat in the suzerain states and the colonies - all these show that the present era is the era of the demise of capitalism and the era of the victory of communism.

Studying the economic laws of capitalism, especially its final stage - imperialism - can enable us to correctly understand the trend of historical development, the disposition of class forces at the present stage and the struggle between them, help us expose the bourgeois apologists who attempt to conceal the pus of modern capitalism, and point out to the enslaved people the path to liberation from the shackles of imperialism.
III

The third part of the textbook examines the economic relations of the socialist mode of production.

Several chapters of the textbook discuss the period of transition from capitalism to socialism. It clarifies the basic ways to transform the economy according to socialist principles.

Relying on the principles of Marx and Engels, Lenin created a complete theory on the period of transition from capitalism to socialism and on the dictatorship of the proletariat, arming the working class and all working people with the scientific knowledge of building socialism.

Readers of this book can see how the Communist Party, relying on objective economic laws, consolidated the alliance of the working class and the peasants, and organized socialist construction. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, implementing Lenin's planned plan, successfully realized the industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, and eliminated capitalist components. Our motherland has become a powerful socialist country with highly developed industry and collective agriculture.

The textbook explains the socialist national economic system and its economic laws, and explains the two forms of socialist ownership of the means of production (state-owned, that is, owned by the whole people, and cooperative collective farm), which is the basis of socialist production relations. Socialist economic laws are generated with the emergence of socialist components, and these laws are increasingly widely used with the development of socialist components, and become the dominant laws with the victory of socialism.

The chapter "Basic Economic Law of Socialism" reveals the essence of this law as expressed by J.V. Stalin based on the basic principles provided in the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. In order to meet the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism, the Party and the government are implementing a consistent policy of improving the welfare of the Soviet people, accelerating the development of all sectors of social production, and giving priority to the development of the production of means of production.

Readers can find in a special chapter the answer to the substance of the law of planned (proportionate) development of the national economy and the question of its regulatory role in the development of the socialist economy, and can understand how this law is used by state organs to plan and lead the national economy.

The Party and the government, in accordance with the requirements of the law of planned development of the national economy, constantly improve the method of socialist planning. On the one hand, the planning work of basic and decisive indicators is consistently centralized, and at the same time, the initiative of local organizations, industrial enterprises, and collective farms in planning and leading production is brought into play, ensuring that a separate attitude is taken towards each economic region, agricultural region, each enterprise, and collective farm when making plans.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government, guided by the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned development of the national economy, are currently implementing a program to drastically increase agricultural production and the production of people's daily necessities on the basis of further growth of heavy industry. Measures are being taken to eliminate the backwardness of individual departments and eliminate errors and shortcomings in planning.

After reading the chapter "Social Labor under the Socialist System," readers can get a concept of the characteristics of labor under the socialist system. Everyone knows that the socialist system has fundamentally changed the nature of labor. Labor discipline has become conscious. But under the socialist system, labor has not yet become the first need of human life. This can only be achieved in the advanced stage of communism. Socialist society faces the task of exercising the strictest supervision over the amount of labor and the amount of consumption, and resolutely overcoming any manifestation of petty-bourgeois egalitarianism. The realization of this task relies on the use of the economic law of distribution according to work, so that laborers are more concerned with the improvement of labor productivity and the growth of social production from their own material interests. At present, the Party and the government thoroughly utilize the principle of material interests to improve agriculture.

The authors of the textbook pay great attention to the issue of labor productivity as the decisive condition for the victory of communism. They point out that the continuous growth of labor productivity is an objective economic law of socialist society.

The textbook talks about the difference between the labor of workers in material production and the labor of workers in non-productive fields, and clarifies the importance of the correct allocation of labor resources between material production and non-productive fields in creating all material data for socialist society. At the present time, when the task of rapidly improving the people's consumption level is being solved, it is particularly important to increase the proportion of labor in the field of material production, strive to simplify the institutions of administrative organs, reduce redundant personnel, and reduce circulation costs, etc.

The book discusses some economic categories, such as commerce, which is the basic form of product distribution under the socialist system; money, finance and credit, economic accounting, profit, cost and price, which are all related to the role of the law of value in the socialist economy.

In accordance with the principles of political economy on the role of commodity production, the law of value, money, and economic accounting in the socialist economy, the Communist Party and the Soviet government are striving to consolidate these economic forms to continuously improve the welfare of the working people, manage business most economically, and accelerate the growth of production. The Party and the government believe that it is of great significance for economic workers to grasp the role of the law of value.

The textbook has a separate chapter to explain the socialist agricultural system. It analyzes the public economy and labor days of the collective farms, and clarifies the essence and forms of differential rent in the collective farms. In order to drastically improve the grain supply of our residents and improve the welfare level of the collective farm peasants, the Communist Party and the Soviet government are currently intensifying the development of all departments of agricultural production. The most important task is to more fully and rationally utilize the land, reclaim large areas of fertile fallow land and virgin land, increase the yield per unit area of crops and the product rate of livestock, strengthen the role of agricultural machinery stations in improving collective farm production, strive to develop the production of state farms, and further consolidate collective farms from an organizational and economic perspective.

The textbook makes readers understand the basic problems of the theory of socialist reproduction and national income, and points out the significance of accumulation and its correct distribution for the growth of the country's economic power and the improvement of the people's welfare.

The exposition of socialist economic issues is concluded by the chapter "Gradual Transition from Socialism to Communism," which clarifies the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the two stages of communist society, discusses the regularity of the transition from socialism to communism, and the most important issues of communist construction in the Soviet Union. The textbook points out that the great Lenin, in developing and enriching the Marxist theory of communism, reached the basic principles on the path of building a communist society.

In the concluding chapters of the textbook, the basic problems of socialist construction in the People's Democratic countries, the regularity and characteristics of their development are clarified. One chapter expounds the economic system of the European People's Democratic countries, and tells the path of socialist development in these countries. There is a special chapter to analyze the economic system of the People's Republic of China and the characteristics of China's socialist construction.

The various countries that have seceded from the world capitalist system and together with the Soviet Union form the socialist camp, are economically combined and have established close cooperation with each other. Completely new, socialist types of international relations have been established, which are based on the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit, respect for the national sovereignty of large and small nations, fraternal mutual assistance, and the plan and organization of all economic ties.

The relationship between the countries of the socialist camp is based on socialist economic laws and is a concrete manifestation of the principles of proletarian internationalism.

The publication of the Textbook of Political Economy will promote more active and creative discussions on important economic issues. The authors wrote in the preface that they intend to continue to further improve the work of the textbook. Undoubtedly, the wishes and suggestions of readers, the experience of universities and colleges studying this Textbook of Political Economy, and the materials accumulated by economic and other teaching and research sections can help the authors of this book to carry out this work.

The ideas of Marxist political economy are of paramount importance to the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, in the struggle against capitalism and for the victory of communism. Recognizing economic laws can correctly understand social processes, scientifically predict the process of economic development, and utilize economic laws to fight for communism.

Political economy points out to the working class in capitalist countries the inevitability of the demise of capitalism and the path to freedom. It teaches the Communist Parties and working people of the People's Democratic countries how to completely eliminate the phenomenon of human exploitation and build a socialist society. Guided by Marxist-Leninist theory and knowledge of objective economic laws, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union formulates and implements scientifically based and practically tested policies, and organizes working people to build communism.

The Textbook of Political Economy will increase the interest of Communist Party members and non-Party members in mastering economic knowledge, and will promote the improvement of the economic knowledge level of cadres.

Cadres of the Party, the Soviet government, and economic departments, workers in industry and agriculture, and our people's intellectuals are unremittingly mastering economic science in order to solve the tasks of communist construction victoriously.

    编者按：苏联国家政治书籍出版局出版的“政治经济学教科书”，是由苏联经济学家康·维·奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫、德·特·谢皮洛夫、列·阿·列昂节夫、伊·德·拉普切夫、伊·伊·康兹明诺夫、拉·莫·卡托夫斯基、帕·费·尤金、阿·伊·巴什科夫、维·伊·别列斯雷金等集体写成的。该书已由中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局着手翻译。现在我们把“真理报”介绍该书内容的文章译载在这里。
    政治经济学教科书出版了。它对马克思列宁主义理论的组成部分——无产阶级政治经济学——的基本问题给了通俗的阐述，指出了它对工人阶级革命活动的重大意义。
    政治经济学教科书的内容包括：序言、各篇——“资本主义前的生产方式”、“资本主义的生产方式”（垄断前的资本主义和垄断资本主义——帝国主义）、“社会主义的生产方式”、结束语。教科书的每一章的后面都有简短的结论。
    序言论述了政治经济学的对象和方法，阐明作为真正科学的无产阶级政治经济学同资产阶级和小资产阶级政治经济学的根本区别。
    序言里论述了工人阶级的伟大领袖和理论家马克思和恩格斯作为无产阶级政治经济学创始人所起的作用。马克思在“资本论”这部经典著作里揭露了资本主义发生、发展和灭亡的法则，从经济方面论证了社会主义革命和无产阶级专政的不可避免。马克思和恩格斯大体上制定了关于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期和关于共产主义社会的两个阶段的学说。
  教科书中着重指出马克思和恩格斯事业的天才继承者弗·依·列宁创造地发展了并丰富了马克思主义的经济学说。他总结了历史发展的新经验并创立了马克思主义关于帝国主义的学说，提出了现代资本主义基本经济法则的要点，拟定了关于资本主义总危机学说的基础，创立了社会主义革命的新理论，科学地探讨了社会主义和共产主义建设的基本问题。
    列宁的伟大战友和学生约·维·斯大林依靠创立了真正科学的政治经济学的马克思、恩格斯和列宁的著作，提出了并发展了政治经济学的一系列新的原理。
    马克思列宁主义经济理论在苏联共产党和各兄弟共产党的决议中，在这些党的领导者们的著作中得到进一步的发展。
       一
    教科书第一篇中说明资本主义前的——原始公社的、奴隶制的、封建主义的——生产方式的经济关系。同时阐述原始时代的社会观念、奴隶制和封建主义时期的经济观点。
    教科书说明了这些经济时代中每一时代的生产力的状况和生产关系的性质。其中提到了生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的法则在资本主义以前形态的各种发展阶段上的作用。
    教科书的作者们从展开人类社会历史的原始公社制度来开始论述各种社会经济形态。在这个时期生产工具都是原始的，人们只有合群才可以得到生活资料，生产资料的所有制带有集体的性质，而产品是在不大的公社范围内按照平均的原则分配的。
    教科书引导读者了解社会经济形态更替的规律性。生产力随着自己的发展，就同原始公社制度条件下存在的生产关系发生矛盾。原始公社制度就不可避免地要被另一个更高级的形态所代替。奴隶制度是在人类社会的发展中合乎规律的前进一步，它引起了生产力的进一步增长。奴隶制度生产关系的基础，就是奴隶主对生产资料和奴隶有完全的所有权。
    人类历史从奴隶制的生产方式起开始进入了剥削阶级和被剥削阶级之间的阶级斗争的时期。由于社会分裂为阶级，就出现了国家，它是少数剥削者压制社会大多数被剥削者的机构。
    后来奴隶制度的生产关系不再适应成长着的生产力，这便注定了这个制度的必然灭亡。
    教科书的作者们讲述封建制度如何起而代替了奴隶制的生产方式并确立起来，它为社会生产力的发展开辟了新的广阔场所。封建社会生产关系的基础是封建主对土地的所有权和对生产工作者——农奴——的不完全的所有权。随着时光的推移，封建社会的生产关系逐渐变成了生产力发展的阻碍。封建社会生产力和生产关系之间的冲突，是资产阶级革命的经济基础，这些革命结束了封建制度，确立了在一定时间内为生产力发展打开广阔场所的资本主义生产关系的统治。
    教科书中对资本主义以前各种形态的经济关系的分析，说明了过时的生产方式灭亡的客观原因，说明了其他的、更进步的生产方式胜利的必然性。
    研究资本主义以前各种形态发展的规律性，不仅具有认识上的而且具有实际上的意义。在被帝国主义者奴役的许多民族的经济中，直到目前还在相当大的范围内保存着封建的、而在某些地方甚至是原始公社式的关系。认识到并估计到资本主义以前各种形态的客观经济法则，就可以正确地认识这些国家里的解放运动的特点。二
    政治经济学教科书第二篇论述资本主义生产方式的经济关系。它对资本主义时代的经济学说作了简短的评述。
    作者们介绍了马克思主义关于资本主义经济制度的学说，指出资本主义的生产关系的基础就是生产资料的资本主义私有制。被剥夺生产资料的雇佣工人阶级的存在，是资本主义固有的现象。
    这篇讲述了马克思创立了剩余价值理论并从而揭示了资本主义基本经济法则，揭穿了资本主义剥削的秘密。
    “资本的积累和无产阶级的贫困化”一章揭露出资本主义积累的矛盾。这里引证了一些事实材料，说明资产阶级手中的财富无止境的增长和工人阶级相对的和绝对的贫困化的不间断的过程。
    读者在书中可以看到在资本主义再生产的进程中资本主义的基本矛盾——生产的社会性和私人资本主义占有形式之间的矛盾——如何尖锐化。这最鲜明地表现为周期性的经济危机、表现为无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争的加强。
    这篇十分注意到叙述马克思所揭示的资本主义生产方式发展的历史趋向。资本主义在发展着生产力并使生产社会化时，一方面创造着社会主义的物质前提，另一方面又产生作为自己的掘墓人的无产阶级，这个阶级组织和领导全体劳动人民争取从资本主义的枷锁下解放出来的革命斗争。
    教科书中以具体材料追溯了垄断前的资本主义转变为帝国主义的过程。作者们阐明了列宁对在理论上总结帝国主义时代各种经济过程所起的作用。
    讲述帝国主义的几章指出，由于现代资本主义基本经济法则作用的结果，帝国主义的一切主要矛盾——劳动和资本之间的矛盾、争夺世界统治权的帝国主义列强之间的矛盾、宗主国和殖民地之间的矛盾，都剧烈地尖锐起来。
    作者们在这里说明了列宁所发现的帝国主义时代资本主义国家经济政治发展不平衡的法则、列宁关于社会主义在一个国家内胜利的可能性的理论。
    随着帝国主义的发展，资本主义总危机的前提就逐渐积累起来。这种危机占据着整个历史时代，这时代的内容是资本主义的灭亡和社会主义在全世界范围内的胜利。资本主义总危机开始于第一次世界大战时期，由于苏联的脱离资本主义体系而特别加深起来。
    由于第二次世界大战和由于欧洲和亚洲人民民主国家从资本主义体系脱离出来的结果，开始了总危机的第二阶段。在这个阶段上，统一的无所不包的世界资本主义市场瓦解了，建立了两个平行的市场，因此，主要资本主义国家对世界资源施展力量的范围缩小了；帝国主义的殖民体系开始瓦解了。资本主义各国发展的不平衡性极端加强了，经济的军事化在经济生活中起着越来越大的作用。在政治方面，资本主义的腐朽，表现为反动的加强，表现为国家制度的法西斯化。
    和平、民主和社会主义阵营的巩固，帝国主义阵营的削弱、宗主国和殖民地中以无产阶级为首的劳动人民的解放斗争的增长——这一切都说明现在的时代是资本主义灭亡的时代，共产主义胜利的时代。
    研究资本主义特别是它的最后阶段——帝国主义——的经济法则，可以使我们正确地认识历史发展的趋向、现阶段阶级力量的布置和它们之间的斗争，帮助我们揭露企图掩藏现代资本主义脓疮的资产阶级辩护士们，向被奴役的人民指出从帝国主义的枷锁下解放出来的道路。
      三
    教科书第三篇中研讨了社会主义生产方式的经济关系。
    教科书有几章论述从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。其中阐明按照社会主义原则改造经济的基本途径。
    依靠马克思和恩格斯的原理，列宁创立了关于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期、关于无产阶级专政的完整的学说，用建设社会主义道路的科学知识来武装了工人阶级和全体劳动人民。
    本书的读者可以看到共产党如何依靠客观的经济法则，巩固了工人阶级和农民的联盟，组织了社会主义建设。苏联共产党执行列宁的预定计划，成功地实现了国家的工业化和农业的集体化，消灭了资本主义成份。我们的祖国变成了一个强大的社会主义国家，有高度发展的工业和集体的农业。
    教科书中说明了社会主义国民经济体系及其经济法则，说明了作为社会主义生产关系基础的生产资料社会主义所有制的两种形式（国家的即全民的，和合作社集体农庄的）。社会主义经济法则，是随社会主义成份的出现而产生的，这些法则随着社会主义成份的发展得到日益广阔的作用范围，并且由于社会主义的胜利而变成了占绝对统治地位的法则。
       “社会主义基本经济法则”一章，揭示出由约·维·斯大林根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁的著作中所提供的基本原理所表述的这个法则的实质。为了适应社会主义基本经济法则的要求，党和政府实行着一贯提高苏联人民福利、加速发展社会所有生产部门并优先发展生产资料生产的政策。
    读者可以在专门的一章中找到关于国民经济有计划（按比例）发展法则的实质、关于它在社会主义经济发展中的调节作用问题的答复，可以了解这个法则如何被国家机关利用来有计划地领导国民经济。
    党和政府按照国民经济有计划发展法则的要求，经常改进社会主义计划工作的方法。一方面，对基本的和决定性的指标的计划工作一贯实行集中化，同时又发挥地方组织、工业企业和集体农庄在有计划地领导生产上的主动性，保证在作计划时对于每一个经济区、农业区、每一个企业、集体农庄采取分别对待的态度。
    共产党和苏维埃政府以社会主义基本经济法则和国民经济有计划发展法则为指南，目前在重工业进一步增长的基础上，实行使农业生产和人民日用品生产急剧增长的纲领。采取消灭个别部门落后状态的措施，消除订计划工作中的错误和缺点。
    读了“社会主义制度下的社会劳动”一章，读者可以对于社会主义制度下劳动的特点获得一个概念。大家知道，社会主义制度从根本上改变了劳动的性质。劳动纪律成为自觉的。但是在社会主义制度下劳动还没有变成人类生活的第一需要。这只有在共产主义的高级阶段才能达到。社会主义社会面临一个任务，就是要对劳动量和消费量实行最严格的监督，坚决克服任何小资产阶级平均主义的表现。这个任务的实现，依靠利用按劳取酬的经济法则，使劳动者更加从个人物质利益上关心劳动生产率的提高和社会生产的增长。目前党和政府彻底利用着物质利益的原则，以求提高农业。
    教科书的作者们对作为共产主义胜利的决定条件的劳动生产率问题给以很大的注意。他们指出劳动生产率的不断增长是社会主义社会的客观经济法则。
      教科书中谈到了物质生产中的工作者的劳动和在非生产领域内工作者的劳动之间的区别，阐明了在创造全部物质资料的物质生产和非生产领域之间劳动资源的正确分配对社会主义社会的重要性。目前正当解决急速提高人民消费水平的任务时，特别重要的是提高物质生产领域内劳动的比重，竭力简化管理机关的机构，裁减冗员，降低流通费用等等。
    书中研讨了一些经济范畴，例如商业，它是社会主义制度下产品分配的基本形式；货币、财政和信用、经济核算、赢利、成本和价格，这些都是同社会主义经济中的价值法则的作用有关的。
    按照政治经济学关于社会主义经济中商品生产、价值法则、货币、经济核算的作用的原理，共产党和苏维埃政府竭力巩固这些经济形式来不断提高劳动人民福利，最节约地进行经营管理，并加速生产的增长。党和政府认为经济工作人员掌握价值法则的作用有着重大的意义。
    教科书有单独的一章来说明社会主义的农业体系。其中对集体农庄的公共经济、劳动日作了分析，阐明了集体农庄中的级差地租的本质和形式。为了急剧提高我国居民的粮食供应并提高集体农庄农民的福利水平，共产党和苏维埃政府目前正在加紧发展农业生产的一切部门。最重要的任务是更充分地和合理地利用土地，开垦大块肥沃的熟荒地和生荒地，提高农作物的单位面积产量和牲畜的产品率，加强农业机器站在提高集体农庄生产中的作用和竭力发展国营农场的生产，进一步从组织上经济上巩固集体农庄。
    教科书使读者了解社会主义再生产和国民收入的理论的基本问题，指出积累及其正确分配对国家经济力量的增长和人民福利的提高的意义。
    社会主义经济问题的阐述由“从社会主义向共产主义逐渐过渡”一章来结束，这一章中阐明马克思列宁主义关于共产主义社会两个阶段的学说，研讨了由社会主义向共产主义过渡的规律性，以及苏联共产主义建设中最重要的问题。教科书中指出伟大的列宁在发展和丰富马克思主义关于共产主义的学说时，得出了关于建设共产主义社会的道路的基本原理。
    在教科书结束的几章中，阐明了各人民民主国家社会主义建设中的基本问题、它们发展的规律性及特点。其中有一章阐述欧洲人民民主国家的经济制度，讲述这些国家的社会主义发展的道路。有专门的一章来分析中华人民共和国的经济制度、中国社会主义建设的特点。
    从世界资本主义体系脱离出来并同苏联一起组成社会主义阵营的各个国家，在经济上结合起来并建立了彼此紧密的合作。完全新的、社会主义类型的国际关系建立起来了，它所根据的原则是完全平等和互利、尊重大小民族的国家主权、兄弟互助、全部经济联系的计划性和组织性。
    社会主义阵营各国间的关系建立在社会主义经济法则之上，是无产阶级国际主义原则的具体表现。
    政治经济学教科书的出版将促进对重要经济问题更加积极的和创造性的讨论。作者们在前言中写道，他们打算继续进一步改进教科书的工作。无疑地，读者的愿望和建议，高等学校研究这本政治经济学教科书的经验，经济学教研室及其他教研室所积累的资料，都可以帮助本书的作者们进行这件工作。
    马克思主义政治经济学的思想对为反对资本主义、争取共产主义胜利而斗争的工人阶级及其先锋队共产党具有头等重要的意义。认识了经济法则，就能够正确地认识社会过程，科学地预见经济发展的进程和利用经济法则来为共产主义而斗争。
    政治经济学向资本主义各国工人阶级指出资本主义灭亡的必然性、争取自由的道路。它教导各人民民主国家的共产党和劳动人民如何去彻底消灭人剥削人的现象并建成社会主义社会。苏联共产党以马克思列宁主义理论和客观经济法则的知识为指南，拟定并实行有科学根据的并在实际中经过考验的政策，组织劳动人民建设共产主义。
    政治经济学教科书将提高共产党员和非党人士掌握经济知识的兴趣，将促进干部的经济知识水平的提高。
    党的、苏维埃的、经济部门的干部、工业和农业工作者、我们人民的知识分子都在为胜利解决共产主义建设的任务而不屈不挠地掌握着经济科学。
