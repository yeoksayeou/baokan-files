He said: I have been in China for nine days, and I will be leaving soon. During this period, wherever I went, I received an extremely warm welcome.

He said: Mutual acquaintance, mutual understanding, and mutual cooperation between the new India and the new China are extremely important. In the new China, I have seen that everywhere is full of great vitality and enthusiasm, and people are working hard to build the new China. I am sure that this enthusiasm and vitality will soon bear fruit.

I wish this new Chinese Shanghai and the residents of Shanghai prosperity, and I hope that not only Shanghai, but also other parts of this great country, will rise to a higher level, thus contributing not only to the happiness of the vast Chinese people, but also to the growth of the world's happiness and peace.

    【新华社二十八日讯】印度共和国总理尼赫鲁等一行十人，在返国途中路经南京、上海两地参观。
    二十七日中午，尼赫鲁总理等乘机由北京飞抵南京。当天，尼赫鲁总理等曾到中山陵献花圈，并游览了明孝陵和灵谷寺等地。在飞往南京途中，尼赫鲁总理等所乘飞机飞临淮河润河集分水闸上空时，他们曾俯瞰了那里的治淮工程的情况。
    二十七日下午四时半，尼赫鲁总理等一行由南京飞抵上海。在飞机场和市区街道上，他们受到数以万计的上海市民的热烈的欢迎。尼赫鲁总理到达上海后，当即由上海市副市长潘汉年等陪同游览了市区。晚上，尼赫鲁总理等出席了潘汉年举行的盛大宴会，尼赫鲁总理曾在宴会上致词。他说：我来到中国已有九天了，不久我就要离去。在这个时期中，不论我到哪里，都受到了异常热烈的欢迎。但是，除了这种热烈的欢迎以外，还使我感到好像是置身于朋友当中一样。的确，在我所受到的欢迎中有一种亲切如家人的感觉。他说：新印度和新中国之间的互相熟识、互相了解和互相合作，是极其重要的。在新中国，我已看到各处都充满了巨大的活力和热情，并为了建设新中国而进行着辛勤工作。我确信这种热情和活力很快将收到效果。
    尼赫鲁总理又说：上海过去是以一个大城市而闻名的；但是，这个城市过去被外国人盘据着和控制着；而现在，这个大城市在新的管理下，无疑将会发展得更为伟大。我祝这个新中国的上海市和上海的居民繁荣，我希望不仅是上海市，而且包括这个伟大国家的其他地方，将提高到更高的水平，从而不但有助于中国广大人民的幸福，而且也有助于世界的幸福与和平的增长。在致词的最后，尼赫鲁总理提议为毛泽东主席的健康干杯。
