    Inner Mongolia's first tractor station, established in July of this year, is now using tractors to deeply plow land for agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    On October 11th, when the tractor appeared on the land of the Red Star Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Tongliao County, it was warmly welcomed by the members and the men and women farmers from outside the cooperative. On that day, the tractor plowed more than 130 mu of land.

    In late September, the tractor station signed cultivation contracts with the nearby Red Star, Double Star, New Hero, and New Victory agricultural producers' cooperatives. The tractor station will plow 3,600 mu of land for these four cooperatives this autumn. Now, tractors equipped with five-bottom plows, three-bottom plows, and spike-tooth harrows are continuing to cultivate land for these agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    内蒙古拖拉机站帮助农业生产合作社耕地
    内蒙古自治区今年七月间成立的第一个拖拉机站，现在正用拖拉机给农业生产合作社深耕土地。
    十月十一日，当拖拉机出现在通辽县红星农业生产合作社的土地上时，它受到社员们和社外男女农民们的热烈欢迎。这一天，拖拉机一共耕了一百三十多亩土地。
    九月下旬拖拉机站和附近的红星、双星、新英雄和新胜利四个农业生产合作社签订了代耕合同。拖拉机站要在今年秋天给这四个社翻耕三千六百亩土地。现在，带着五铧犁、三铧犁和钉齿耙的拖拉机，正继续为这些农业生产合作社耕地。
