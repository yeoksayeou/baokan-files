Xinhua News Agency, New York, 7th: The United Nations General Assembly General Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of October 5 to discuss the inclusion of two new items proposed by the Soviet delegation on the agenda of the General Assembly. These two new items are: 1. "On the Conclusion of an International Convention (Treaty) on the Reduction of Armaments, the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction"; 2. "On the Violation of Freedom of Navigation on the Seas off China."

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, stated that the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to include the item "On the Violation of Freedom of Navigation on the Seas off China" on the agenda of the General Assembly as an important and urgent issue. He pointed out that the pirate activities of the Chiang Kai-shek personnel attacking merchant ships in the seas off China have recently become more frequent. British, Danish, Polish, and Soviet merchant ships have been subjected to such attacks. These actions seriously undermine the recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas, and the General Assembly must resolutely condemn them to prevent such incidents from recurring. Another circumstance that makes it necessary to include this issue on the agenda of the General Assembly is that despite repeated requests from the Soviet government to the United States government—whose navy controls the seas off China in the Taiwan area—to take measures to stop these criminal actions by the Chiang Kai-shek personnel, these requests have not yielded positive results.

The representative of the Kuomintang clique moved to postpone the discussion of this issue because the French government is negotiating with the Chiang Kai-shek authorities on the settlement of the "Tuapse" incident involving a Soviet merchant ship.

The Kuomintang element's suggestion was supported by the French and American representatives. The French representative, Hoppenot, said that the Soviet delegation's proposal to include this item on the agenda of the General Assembly was perfectly legitimate. However, he believes it is best to wait for the outcome of the French government's negotiations with the Kuomintang clique regarding the "Tuapse" merchant ship. The British representative, Lloyd, expressed the same opinion.

In response to the speeches of the French representative and the Kuomintang elements, the Soviet representative said that their suggestions were irrelevant to the Soviet delegation's proposal. The Soviet proposal addresses the issue of the violation of freedom of navigation on the seas off China, while the Kuomintang elements and the French representative propose to postpone the discussion of this issue because negotiations are currently underway on a specific incident related to the violation of this navigation principle. Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations between the French government and the Chiang Kai-shek elements on one of the many incidents that have occurred, the General Committee should still consider the issue of the violation of freedom of navigation on the seas off China.

The Czechoslovak representative supported the Soviet delegation's proposal.

The General Committee decided by a majority of nine votes (including the United States, Britain, and France) to postpone the discussion of the Soviet proposal to include this item on the agenda of the General Assembly for a few days. The Soviet and Czechoslovak delegations voted against it, and the delegations of Burma, Syria, and the Netherlands abstained.

The General Committee then discussed the inclusion of the Soviet Union's new proposal on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons on the agenda of the General Assembly.

Vyshinsky said that in the current situation where international tensions have eased, it is possible to reach an agreement on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to include this issue as a separate item on the agenda of the General Assembly and to submit it to the Political Committee as an urgent and important issue.

The General Committee unanimously decided to recommend that the General Assembly include the Soviet proposal on the agenda of the General Assembly and refer the issue to the Political Committee for discussion. According to the rules of procedure, the Political Committee will decide on the procedure for discussing the Soviet proposal.

The British, American, and French representatives believe that the Political Committee should simultaneously discuss the Soviet proposal and the report of the Disarmament Commission, which has already been included on the agenda of this committee. The Soviet representative said that the procedure for discussing the Soviet proposal must be decided by the Political Committee itself.

    联大总务委员会举行会议
    建议把苏联关于裁军新提案列入联大议程
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会总务委员会在十月五日下午举行会议，讨论关于把苏联代表团提出的两个新项目列入大会议程的问题。这两个新项目就是：一、“关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约（条约）”；二、“关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基表示，苏联代表团认为必须把“关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”这个项目作为一个重要而紧急的问题列入大会议程。他指出，蒋介石人员在中国海面袭击商船的海盗行为，最近变得更加频繁了。受到这种袭击的是英国、丹麦、波兰和苏联的商船。这种行动严重破坏了公认的公海航行自由的原则，大会必须坚决加以谴责，以防止这种事件再发生。使得这个问题有必要列入大会议程的另一种情况是：尽管苏联政府一再要求美国政府——它的海军控制着台湾地区的中国海面——采取措施阻止蒋介石人员的这种罪恶行动，然而这些要求并没有得到积极的结果。
    国民党集团的代表提出动议，主张延迟讨论这个问题，因为法国政府正在同蒋介石当局商谈有关解决苏联商船“图阿普斯号”事件的问题。
    国民党分子的建议得到法国和美国代表的支持。法国代表奥培诺说，苏联代表团要求在大会议程中列入这个项目的建议是完全正当的。但是，他认为最好还是等待法国政府同国民党集团关于“图阿普斯号”商船的谈判的结果。英国代表劳埃德表示了同样的意见。
    苏联代表在答复法国代表和国民党分子的演说时说：他们的建议同苏联代表团的建议是不相干的。苏联的建议提出的是侵犯在中国海面的航行自由问题，而国民党分子和法国的代表则因为现在正在就有关侵犯这种航行原则的一个具体事件进行谈判而提议延期讨论这个问题。不管法国政府和蒋介石分子就已发生的许多事件之一进行谈判的结果如何，总务委员会还是应该考虑侵犯在中国海面的航行自由问题。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表支持苏联代表团的建议。
    总务委员会以九票的多数（包括美、英、法三国）决定延迟几天讨论苏联提出的把这个项目列入大会议程的建议。苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团投票反对，缅甸、叙利亚和荷兰的代表团弃权。
    总务委员会接着讨论把苏联所提出的关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的新提案列入大会议程的问题。
    维辛斯基说，在目前国际紧张局势有了缓和的情况下，就裁减军备和禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器问题达成协议是可能的。苏联代表团认为有必要把这个问题作为一个单独的项目列入大会议程，并作为一个紧急和重要的问题向政治委员会提出。
    总务委员会一致决定建议大会把苏联的建议列入大会议程，并把这个问题提交政治委员会讨论。根据议事规则，政治委员会将自行决定讨论苏联的建议的程序问题。
    英国、美国和法国代表认为政治委员会应该对苏联的建议和已经列入这个委员会议程的裁军委员会的报告同时进行讨论。苏联代表说：讨论苏联建议的程序问题必须由政治委员会本身决定。
