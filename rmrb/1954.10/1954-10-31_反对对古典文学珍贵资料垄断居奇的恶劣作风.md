    Oppose the Bad Practice of Monopolizing and Hoarding Precious Classical Literature Materials
       Huang Suqiu
    Recently, newspapers and magazines such as "People's Daily" have published articles criticizing the erroneous viewpoints in the research work of "Dream of the Red Chamber," pointing out that the bourgeois idealist viewpoints of the Hu Shi school of "New Redology" still occupy a dominant position in the research work of classical literature, while the literary circles have long turned a blind eye to this. The presentation of this issue is indeed of great significance to the research work of classical literature, and it will guide the research work of classical literature in the right direction.
    Another issue related to this problem, namely, the bad practice of monopolizing classical literature materials and keeping them secret, has not yet been exposed. Many of the research materials on classical literature are so-called "unique copies in the country." Once monopolized, they become "rare goods" for a few people. They can certainly write articles and become "experts" based on these materials, but more classical literature researchers, especially some young researchers, have no chance to see these materials, which greatly limits and hinders these precious materials from playing a greater role. Isn't this also a thorough bourgeois practice? Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to expose the examples of this bad practice that I know, in order to facilitate the development of classical literature research.
    As far as I know, Mr. Yu Pingbo is one of those who have this bad practice. Leaving aside the situation before liberation, just speaking of after liberation, around the end of last year, Mr. Yu Pingbo actually wrote a letter, through the Institute of Literature of Peking University, to the Peking University Library, stating that the Zhiyanzhai commentary version of "Dream of the Red Chamber" should not be lent to others.
    What does this show? This shows that Yu Pingbo and others have always believed that certain precious materials seem to be allowed only for some privileged figures to read, while young researchers have no right to borrow them. Isn't this idea clearly connected with Hu Shi's idea of stealing the "Shui Jing Zhu," secretly hiding a copy of the Jiaxu year Zhiyanzhai re-commentary version of "Dream of the Red Chamber" of Qianlong, and hoarding it as a rare commodity? The service object of the library should be the broad masses, at least a relatively broad group of people within a specific scope (such as a school), and certainly not just a few "experts." However, some "experts" with privileged ideas believe that the library (not just the Peking University Library) should refuse to lend rare ancient books to unknown young researchers or national publishing institutions. This also shows that the idea of ​​regarding rare ancient books as the wealth of a few people and monopolizing and hoarding them is not very isolated.
    Of course, precious ancient books should be taken great care of. In the past, some young cadres of national publishing institutions, due to insufficient understanding of the important value of precious ancient books, did cause some individual losses due to insufficient care when they first came into contact with certain rare books. However, after education and criticism from relevant agencies, this situation has changed. Should we refuse to lend these precious ancient books altogether based on these extremely individual cases? Obviously not. Unfortunately, this has become a major excuse for some libraries to refuse to lend these precious ancient books. According to some workers of national publishing institutions, they have encountered many unexpected difficulties when borrowing books from some collectors and libraries when they are carrying out the work of collating, sorting out, reprinting, and photocopying some ancient books. The work currently being done by national publishing institutions in this regard is to turn "unique copies" into popular editions, and turn rare and secret books that could only be read by a few people in the past into cultural wealth that can be shared by the majority of readers. This is a very meaningful task. However, the first thing we encounter when carrying out this work is the many difficulties of "not being able to borrow books," all kinds of excuses, and a lot of obstacles such as systems, regulations, and methods. Systems, regulations, etc. are needed, and we cannot oppose them across the board. But, may I ask, what are the systems, regulations, etc. for? If it cannot serve the beneficial cause of the people, but instead becomes an obstacle, then it is worth considering. If we say that, due to this kind of obstacle, the publishing plan of the national publishing institution is affected, the meeting of these precious materials with a wider range of readers is affected, and thus the development of classical literature research work is also affected, it does not seem to be excessive.
    In addition, Mr. Wu Enyu, who is also a researcher of "Dream of the Red Chamber," also has similar things. He discovered some materials about "Dream of the Red Chamber" in the home of a descendant of the "banner people." Some of his articles, such as "Three Poems by Yongzhong Mourning Cao Xueqin" ("Guangming Daily," September 7, 1954), "About Cao Xueqin" ("New Observer," issues 16, 17, and 18, 1954), etc., are partly based on these materials. In his articles, he said: These materials "have not been circulated outside," "they all have their importance and are important materials for textual research on Cao Xueqin and 'Dream of the Red Chamber'." However, he is unwilling to make these materials public. He once directly told the editors of "New Observer" magazine: He is the only one who has these materials, and he does not want others to see them, especially not want the staff of the People's Literature Publishing House to see them. This is probably because there are also people who study "Dream of the Red Chamber" there! In his opinion, these materials are like his "patents." If others also master these materials, it would infringe on his interests. Please see, is this the attitude that should be taken in academic research? It is probably not excessive to say that it has the atmosphere of a businessman and a philistine!
    Truth is not afraid of discussion. If some precious materials in classical literature can be more widely used and more people can study them from various aspects, it will only be of great benefit to sorting out and carrying forward the excellent tradition of classical heritage, thereby nourishing the development of new literature and art.
    Now is the time to eliminate the bad practice of monopolizing and hoarding precious materials of classical heritage.

### 反对对古典文学珍贵资料垄断居奇的恶劣作风

    反对对古典文学珍贵资料垄断居奇的恶劣作风
       黄肃秋
    最近“人民日报”等报纸杂志上发表了一些批判“红楼梦”研究工作中的错误观点的文章，指出了胡适之派的“新红学家”们的资产阶级唯心主义观点仍然在古典文学研究工作中占统治地位，而长期以来，文艺界对此却视若无睹。这一问题的提出，对古典文学研究工作的确有很重要的意义，它将引导古典文学研究工作走向正确的方向。
    和这个问题有联系的另一问题，即把古典文学资料垄断起来、秘而不宣的恶劣作风，目前还没有人揭发出来。而古典文学的研究资料，有不少是所谓“海内孤本”，一经垄断，即成了少数人的“奇货”，他们固然可以根据这些资料写文章，当“专家”，而更多的古典文学研究工作者，特别是一些年青的研究工作者，和这些资料却无缘相见，这就大大限制了、妨碍了这些珍贵资料发挥它的更大效用。这难道不也是一种地地道道的资产阶级作风吗？因此，我愿趁着这个机会，把我所知道的这种恶劣作风的事例揭发出来，以利于古典文学研究工作的开展。
    据我所知，俞平伯先生就是有这种恶劣作风的一个。解放以前的情形且不管它，只说解放以后，大约在去年年底，俞平伯先生居然还写信，经过北京大学文学研究所，向北京大学图书馆提出，不应该把红楼梦的脂砚齐评本借给别人看。
    这说明什么呢？这说明了俞平伯等人一直认为，某些珍贵的资料，似乎只容许一些具有特权的人物来阅读，而青年研究者是无权借阅的。这种思想，难道不是和偷走了“水经注”、秘藏一部红楼梦的乾隆甲戌年脂砚齐重评本、居为奇货的胡适之的思想有着明显的相通之处吗？图书馆的服务对象，应该是广大的群众，至少也是某一特定范围内（如学校）的比较广泛的群众，而绝不能只是少数的“专家”。但某些具有特权思想的“专家”却认为图书馆（不只是北京大学图书馆）对于不知名的青年研究工作者或国家出版机关借阅珍本古籍，是应该闭门不纳的。这也说明把珍本古籍视为少数人的财富，加以垄断、居奇的思想并不是很个别的。
    当然，对珍本古籍是应该极力爱护的。过去有些国家出版机关的青年干部，由于对珍本古籍的重要价值认识不足，在开始接触到某些善本书籍时，因为不够爱护而造成亏损的个别现象，也是有过的。但经过有关机关的教育、批评，这种情况已经改变了。应不应该根据这样一些极为个别的情况，对珍本古籍的外借一概加以拒绝呢？显然是不应该的。遗憾的是，这却成了某些图书馆拒绝借阅这些珍本古籍的很大的借口。据某些国家出版机关工作者反映，他们在进行某些古籍的校勘、整理、重刊、影印工作时，在向某些藏书家和图书馆借书时，就曾遭到许多意外的困难。而国家出版机关目前在这方面所做的工作，正是要把“孤本”变成普及本，把过去只能为少数人阅读的珍本秘籍，变成能为广大读者共同享用的文化财富。这是一件极有意义的工作。但进行这件工作时，首先碰到的却是这样“借不出书来”的重重困难，却是这样那样的借口，却是一大堆制度、章程、办法之类的阻碍。制度、章程等等是需要的，我们不能一概加以反对。但，试问制度、章程等等是为什么服务的呢？如果它不能为人民的有益的事业服务，反而成为阻碍，那就值得考虑了。如果我们说，由于这种的阻碍，影响了国家出版机关的出版计划，影响了这些珍贵的资料和更广泛的读者见面，从而也影响了古典文学研究工作的开展，似乎也不是过分的。
    此外，也是一位红楼梦研究者的吴恩裕先生，也有类似的事情。他在一家“旗人”后裔的家里，发现了一些有关红楼梦的资料，他的若干文章，如“永忠弔曹雪芹的三首诗”（“光明日报”一九五四年九月七日）、“关于曹雪芹”（“新观察”一九五四年十六、十七、十八期）等，有一部分就是根据这些资料写成的。他在文章里说：这些材料“外间没有流传”，“它们都各有其重要性、都是考证曹雪芹和‘红楼梦’的重要材料”。但是他却不愿意把这些材料公开出来。他曾直接地对“新观察”杂志的编者讲过：这些材料只他一个人有，他不希望给别人看，特别不希望给人民文学出版社编辑部的人员看到。这大概是因为那里也有研究红楼梦的人吧！在他看来，这些材料就好像是他的“专利品”，如果别人也掌握了这些材料，那就侵害了他的利益。请看，这是研究学术的应有的态度吗？说它有商人、市侩的气息，大概不是过分的吧！
    真理是不怕讨论的。古典文学中的某些珍贵资料，如果能得到更广泛的利用，得到更多的人从各方面加以研究，对于整理和发扬古典遗产的优良传统，从而滋养新的文学艺术的发展，只会有很大好处的。
    现在已经是到了肃清那种对于古典遗产的珍贵资料垄断、居奇的恶劣作风的时候了。
