Everyone who has visited the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction can easily see from the specific exhibits the advanced level of Soviet industrial technology, the scale of agricultural mechanization, the high achievements in culture and art, and the happy and fulfilling life of the people. One can experience the prosperity and strength of socialist Soviet Union in a relaxed and pleasant way, without feeling tired at all, thereby being inspired and strengthening confidence in building the motherland. The success of this exhibition is largely due to the art design.

The art design of the Soviet Exhibition is outstanding. It organizes the diverse and varied exhibits in an orderly manner, appropriately equips the wall displays with the actual objects on the exhibition stands, combines charts and figures with vivid images, unifies the interior decoration with the entire exhibits, harmonizes the coloring of local decorations with the overall color scheme, utilizes various light sources, and coordinates with the artistic decorations of the architecture. All these allow the art designers to use the most accessible and obvious forms to clearly express the content of the displays, helping the audience to better obtain a complete and profound impression. This is a specialized art in exhibition design and a model for our exhibition work today.

Display decoration does not exist in isolation. This kind of decorative design cannot be separated from the purpose of the display, and it must be entirely for the purpose of deepening the audience's impression of the exhibition theme. We see that the art design of some exhibitions often uses the gorgeousness of the exterior decoration to salvage and cover up the exhibition content that has not been carefully considered. Or it indiscriminately uses various fret patterns, swastikas, geometric shapes, five-pointed stars, red flags and other colorful backgrounds, attempting to "enhance" exhibits such as charts and photos. This kind of form that is not related to the content often distracts the audience's attention and may even distort the original meaning of the exhibition theme.

The art design in the Soviet Exhibition clearly tells us that the socialist realism design approach ensures the consistency of content and form. It not only requires content to play a leading role in the display structure, but also requires the style and layout to adapt to a certain theme ideology. Designed according to this principle, we cannot see any embellishments and decorations unrelated to the content in the exhibition, nor can we find the phenomenon of exhibits piling up and being listed, and there is no innovative "formalism" style. Chief Art Designer Klimashin brilliantly expressed the rich ideological content of the exhibition, and this rich ideological content is expressed in the special exhibition language and vivid image art. This is a very prominent success of the Soviet Exhibition in art design. Here I will only take the agricultural pavilion as an example to talk about it.

The overall color of the agricultural pavilion is based on light green and golden yellow, which is in line with the natural colors of crops and fruits. This color environment gives the audience a kind feeling towards the exhibits. In order to expand the display area, the wall surface is used to form a complete layout. The upper edges of all the wall surfaces are decorated with brass flower bands: one is a pattern of sunflowers and ears of grain, and the other is a pattern of wheat ears, laurel leaves and a five-pointed star medal decorated with a hammer and sickle, symbolizing the honor of the worker-peasant alliance and the fruits of labor. This decoration is also in line with the requirements of the theme. At the same time, the brass color is harmonious with the yellow curtains. Each wall surface constitutes a unit, and each unit belongs to the whole and becomes an organic system with other units. This system appropriately expresses the entire theme of the agricultural pavilion, and the logic is clear. The content of the displays on each wall surface is concise and clear, without trivial things and superfluous details to divide or hinder the leading ideology of the theme. For example, in the unit "Soviet rice planting has been mechanized," the upper part of the wall surface is a photo of an endless rice field, and there are three pictures on the left and right to illustrate the mechanized cultivation, irrigation and harvesting. In the middle is a figurative chart illustrating the highest record of rice yield per hectare created by Ishaev, the Socialist Labor Hero and Stalin Prize winner of the Keteldu Collective Farm in the Kazakh Republic, and the planting area and yield of the Stalin Collective Farm in Kharezm Oblast. On the exhibit table below are three glass bottles filled with grains, with a bundle of rice specimens on the left and right. The copper base of the glass bottles and the flower band of the bundled rice are decorated with folk patterns. Although the flower band is colorful, it does not feel dazzling and prominent. This kind of art design, from plane to three-dimensional, truly and perfectly expresses the rich content of the exhibits, making them produce a strong image appeal to the audience, replacing lengthy analytical materials. It clearly and convincingly points out the superiority of Soviet socialist agriculture at a glance. This design is indeed worthy of our art designers to learn from.

The design of the entire color tone in the exhibition not only pays attention to the mutual coordination between the color of the walls and the color of the exhibits, but also meets the requirements of the nature of each pavilion. The art designers of some of our exhibitions often start from the requirements of the brightness and saturation of the colors in isolation, and paint the walls and the background colors of the charts into bright dark colors. This may be a very successful background color for a single chart, and it may stimulate the attention of the general audience, but in most cases, this kind of bright wall or background color of the chart often has a destructive effect on the integrity. At the same time, the sudden change of various bright colors and excessive stimulation of the vision will make people feel tired, which is tantamount to abuse of the audience. In the Soviet Exhibition, we not only feel comfortable with the color, but also pay attention to making the audience's vision not feel tired, no matter the height of the display position, the distance between the audience and the exhibits, or the strength of the light, showing a high degree of design spirit of serving the masses.

The charts in the exhibition are also very noteworthy. It uses concrete figures to illustrate the state of national economic construction, people's lives and production development, making it easy for the audience to understand, remember, and compare. The charts in the exhibition are different from general statistical charts. They should not be boring data, but should illustrate the problem vividly, concisely, and clearly, and play an educational role. For example, the chart on improving pig breeds in the agricultural pavilion of the Soviet Exhibition has a very vivid wood carving pattern at the top of the chart: a sow lying down with a group of piglets nursing. The surrounding lace is decorated with corn, potatoes, wheat and other shapes. The designer simplifies the complex into simple and turns the boring into interesting with the most concise techniques. Therefore, the purpose and impression of this chart to us is fresh and clear, and extremely easy to feel. The decorations and colors of other charts such as the development of cattle and sheep animal husbandry also obey the requirements of the whole, maintain a coordinated color, and form a unified and harmonious style.

From the perspective of the role played by these decorations and display designs for the purpose and ideological content of the exhibition, the art work of the exhibition is very important, and it directly affects the image education function of the exhibition. In the process of participating in the actual work of the art design experts of the Soviet Exhibition, I deeply realized the profound theoretical and technical accomplishment of the Soviet art design workers, as well as the serious and rigorous work attitude.

    学习苏联展览会的美术设计
  　吴劳
    每一个参观过苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的人，都会从展览会的具体展品中很容易地看出苏联的工业技术水平的先进，农业机械化的规模，文化艺术的高度成就以及人民幸福美满的生活情况；轻松愉快地、丝毫不感到疲倦地体会到社会主义苏联的繁荣、富强，从而受到感染，加强了建设祖国的信心。这次展览工作的成功，美术设计方面是起了很大作用的。
    苏联展览会的美术设计是杰出的，它把种类繁多、形式不一的各项展品组织得有条不紊，壁面陈列与展品台上实物恰当的配备，图表数字和生动形象的结合，室内装饰和整个展品的一致，局部装饰的着色和整体色彩的调和，各种光线来源的运用，以及和建筑上艺术装饰的协调，所有这些，美术设计者都用最通俗、最明显的形式，很清楚地表现出陈列的内容，帮助观众更好地得出完整的深刻的印象。这是展览会设计工作中的专门艺术，是我们今天展览会工作中的典范。
    陈列装饰，不是孤立地存在的，这种装饰设计不能离开陈列的目的性，必须完全是为着加深展出主题对观众的印象的。我们看到有些展览会的美术设计，常常用外表装饰的华丽来挽救、掩盖未经深思熟虑的展出内容。或者胡乱采用各种回纹、卍字、几何形、五角星、红旗等彩色斑斓的背景，企图使图表、照片等展品“增色”。这种同内容并不相关的形式，常会分散观众的注意力，甚至会歪曲展出主题的原意。
    在苏联展览会中的美术设计，清楚地告诉我们，社会主义现实主义的设计手法，保证了内容同形式的一致。它不仅在陈列结构中要求内容起主导作用，而且风格、布局也要适应一定的主题思想。按照这一原则的设计，所以在展览会中，我们看不到同内容无关的点缀和装饰，也找不出展品堆积和罗列的现象，更没有标新立异的“形式主义”的作风。美术总设计师克利马辛出色地表现了展览会丰富的思想内容，而这种丰富的思想内容，是用特殊的展览会的语言和鲜明的形象艺术表现出来的。这是苏联展览会在美术设计上很突出地成功的地方。这里我仅以农业馆为例来说一说。
    农业馆整个的色彩，是用嫩绿色和金黄色作为基本的色调，这是符合庄稼和果实的自然色彩的。这种色彩的环境给予观众对展品的感情是亲切的。为了扩大陈列面积，利用壁面构成完整的布局，所有壁面的上边沿都装饰着黄铜制作的花带：一种是向日葵和谷穗的图案，另一种是麦穗、桂叶和饰有镰刀铁锤的五角星奖章的图形，象征着工农联盟的荣誉和劳动的果实，这装饰也是符合于主题的要求。同时黄铜色与黄色窗帘是调和的。每一个壁面构成一个单元，每个单元都从属于整体，同其他单元成为有机的体系，这个体系恰当地表现了农业馆的整个主题，而且逻辑清楚。每个壁面的陈列，内容简洁明朗，没有琐碎的东西和多余的细节来分割或阻碍主题的主导思想。例如“苏联种稻工作已经机械化了”这一单元中，壁面的上方是一幅一望无际的水稻田的照片，左右各三张图片说明用机械化耕种、灌溉和收割的情形。当中是形象化的图表，说明哈萨克共和国克捷尔都集体农庄的社会主义劳动英雄和斯大林奖金获得者依沙哈耶夫创造了水稻收获量每公顷产量最高纪录的数字，以及哈列兹莫省斯大林集体农庄的播种面积和收获量的数字。下方的展品台上陈列着三个装着谷子的玻璃瓶，左右各放一捆稻子的标本，玻璃瓶的铜座和捆稻子的花带，都有民间纹样的装饰，虽是五彩的花带，但并不感到刺目突出。这样的美术设计，由平面到立体，真实地、形式完善地表现了展品丰富的内容，使得它们对于观众产生强烈的形象的感染力，代替了长篇大论的分析资料。一目了然地，令人信服地指出了苏维埃社会主义农业的优越。这种设计，确是很值得我们美术设计者效法的。
    展览会中整个色调的设计，不仅注意到墙壁的色彩和展品的颜色之间的互相协调，同时又符合各馆性质的要求。我们有些展览会的美术设计者，往往孤立地只从色彩的鲜明性和饱和性的要求出发，将墙壁和图表的底色涂刷成鲜艳的深色，这在单独一幅图表来看可能是很成功的衬托的底色，并可能刺激一般观众的注意力，可是在大多数的场合下，这种鲜艳的墙壁或图表的底色，常常是对整体性起着破坏的作用。同时，种种鲜艳色彩的互相突然变换，过多地刺激视觉，就会令人感到疲倦，这无异是对观众的一种虐待。在苏联展览会中，我们不仅感到色彩的舒服，而且无论是陈列地位的高低，观众和展品距离的远近，光线的强弱，都能注意到使观众的视觉不感疲倦，表现出高度的为群众服务的设计精神。
    展览会中的图表也非常值得注意。它用具体的数字，说明了国家经济建设、人民生活和生产发展的情况，使观众容易了解，便于记忆，更便于比较。展览会中的图表不同于一般的统计图表，它不应当是枯燥的资料，而应当形象地、简洁地、明显地说明问题，起教育作用。如苏联展览会农业馆中关于改良猪种的图表，图表的上方是一个很生动的木雕图样：卧着的一只母猪带着一群正在吃奶的小猪。旁边的花边是以玉米、马铃薯、麦子等物形为装饰的。设计者以最简练的手法使复杂化为单纯，乏味变为有趣。因而这个图表的目的和给我们的印象是清新明朗的，极易感受的。其他如发展牛、羊牧畜业等的图表的装饰和色彩，也都是服从于整体的要求，保持着协调的色彩，形成统一和谐的风格。
    从这些装饰、陈列设计对于展出的目的和思想内容所起的作用来看，展览会的美术工作是非常重要的，它直接影响着展览会形象教育的机能。我在参与苏联展览会的美术设计专家们实际工作的过程里，深深认识到苏联美术设计工作者在理论和技术方面高深的修养，以及认真严格的工作态度。
