    Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard's first large Yangtze River cargo ship, the "Dazhong" (Masses) began construction in November of last year and completed initial construction work by August 16th of this year. After launching, following two months of intense labor emulation by the entire factory, the installation of the main engine and auxiliary engines was completed on September 30th, and a trial run was conducted.

    This large cargo ship is the largest cargo ship built by the Zhonghua Shipyard in its twenty-plus years of history. The hull is 88 meters long, with a displacement of 2,726 metric tons and a deadweight of 1,800 metric tons. The ship is equipped with six steam derricks, the largest of which can lift 10 metric tons, capable of lifting two fully loaded 3.5-ton trucks simultaneously. Soon, this large cargo ship will undertake national shipping tasks between Shanghai and Hankou.

    Workers at the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company presented their first oil barge with a carrying capacity of 3,700 tons, as a gift to celebrate National Day. This barge is a large inland river barge with a displacement of 5,100 tons, and is also suitable for coastal shipping. It is the first time that such an oil barge has been manufactured in our country.

    On September 29th, the oil barge was launched. The oil barge was adorned with colorful nautical flags, and amidst firecrackers and enthusiastic applause, it slowly entered the water.

    During the barge's manufacturing process, the workers launched a labor emulation campaign to welcome National Day, ensuring the quality of the ship and accelerating the speed of shipbuilding. The workers in Yu Qinghai's riveting team, who were responsible for riveting the “forward upright outer plates," actively studied advanced Soviet operational methods such as specialized division of labor based on their own emulation conditions, and completed their task eight days ahead of schedule. Technicians Sun Jialiang, Pan Zhengming, and section chief Xu Yuanmao jointly developed a rationalization proposal to "modify the curved plate's butt joint," saving more than 140 shipbuilding steel plates throughout the shipbuilding process.

    上海中华造船厂建造的货轮生火试车
    中苏造船公司工人制造大型油驳船成功
    上海公私合营中华造船厂从去年十一月份开始建造的第一艘大型长江货轮“大众号”，到今年八月十六日完成初步建造工作，下水后，经过全厂职工两个月的紧张劳动竞赛，已在九月三十日全部完成主机和副机的安装工作，并生火试车。
    这艘大型货轮，是中华造船厂建厂二十多年来建造的第一艘最大的货轮。船身长八十八公尺，排水量二千七百二十六公吨，载重量一千八百公吨。船上装有六座蒸汽吊杆，其中最大的吊杆可起重十公吨，能把两部装满三吨半的卡车同时吊起。不久，这艘大型货轮就将担负上海和汉口之间的国家航运任务。

    中苏造船公司的工人在国庆前夕以他们制造的第一只载重量三千七百吨油驳船，作为给国庆节的献礼。这只驳船是一种大型内河驳船，排水量达五千一百吨，也适合于近海航运。像这样的油驳船在我国还是第一次制造。
    九月二十九日，这只油驳船举行了入水式。油驳船上飘扬着鲜艳的航海旗，在鞭炮和热烈的掌声中，徐徐地进入水中。
    这只驳船在制造过程中，工人们曾展开了迎接国庆节的劳动竞赛，保证了船的质量，又加快了造船的速度。铆“前立稳外板”的于清海铆工组的工人，根据自己的竞赛条件，积极学习了苏联的分工专责等先进操作方法，提前八天完成了任务。技术员孙嘉良、潘正明和工段长徐元茂共同研究出“改弯板对口缝”的合理化建议，在整个造船过程中，节省了一百四十多张造船钢板。
