Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, October 4th: TASS reported from Vienna on October 4th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued the following statement to the press:

    In violation of the clearly expressed desire for national independence and peaceful coexistence by the representatives of the vast majority of Asian countries, a war pact initiated by the Washington government has been signed in Manila.
    The rulers of the United States have seized an important area near Taiwan in order to separate Taiwan from China, thus exposing their true intentions towards the Chinese people.
    Since this pact is aimed at the People's Republic of China, it is also a threat to all Asian countries.
    This pact is another manifestation of the policy of military blocs pursued by the United States government, and a new proof of its attempt to alienate the Asian people and instigate them to kill each other.
    This is a serious threat to world peace, to the independence, security, and living standards of the people in that part of the world. At a time when the hope of easing international tensions is growing stronger among the people of the world, this is a new attempt to worsen the international situation.
    Of the eight countries that signed the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty, five are not Asian countries. This pact provides the United States with an excuse to interfere in the affairs of Asian countries, and it also facilitates colonial countries to interfere in the internal affairs of the people in that part of the world.
    In order to ensure the maximum profits of monopoly capital and for the strategic purposes of imperialist countries, the Manila Pact, under the guise of economic and social plans, leads to the intensified plunder of the natural resources of Southeast Asian countries.
    For the vast number of people and working people in the countries that have already signed this pact, this pact means a greater degree of poverty and exploitation, and means that the democratic national liberation movement and the trade union movement for the rights of working people will be subjected to more bloody suppression.
    The vast majority of Southeast Asian countries, with a population of over one billion, are unwilling to participate in the Manila Pact. They denounce this pact. They express that the Asian people demand the establishment of international relations not based on force, and hope to solve problems related to their countries themselves.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions is convinced that the Asian people have every right to create their own lives without any foreign interference. The World Federation of Trade Unions hails the recent statements by the representatives of the People's Republic of China, India, and the Union of Burma regarding the policy of peaceful coexistence in Asia. These statements are an important contribution to the national independence, peace, and social development of Asia.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions believes that expanding ties between Asian countries in a peaceful manner can guarantee their economic development and improve the living standards of the vast majority of people.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions pays tribute to the heroic struggle of the working people of these countries for peace, and believes that they will strengthen their unity in the struggle for the implementation of a policy of peaceful coexistence, respect for democracy, trade union rights, and improvement of living and working conditions.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions expresses the full solidarity of all workers in the world with the working people of Asian countries.

### 世界工会联合会书记处发表声明  谴责侵略性的东南亚防务条约

    世界工会联合会书记处发表声明
    谴责侵略性的东南亚防务条约
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社维也纳四日讯：世界工会联合会书记处向报界发表声明如下：
    在违反绝大多数亚洲国家的代表们所明确表示的民族独立及和平共处的愿望的情况下，华盛顿政府所发起的一个战争公约已经在马尼拉签订了。
    美国的统治者们攫取了台湾附近的一个重要地区，以便把台湾从中国分割开来，这样他们就暴露了他们对中国人民的真正企图。
    由于这个公约的矛头是指向中华人民共和国的，因此，它也是对一切亚洲国家的威胁。
    这个公约是美国政府所施行的军事集团的政策的又一表现，这是美国政府企图离间亚洲人民、指使他们互相残杀的一个新的证明。
    这是对世界和平，对世界那个部分的人民的独立、安全和生活水平的一个严重威胁。在全世界人民对于缓和国际紧张局势的希望日益强烈的时候，这是一个想使国际局势恶化的新企图。
    在所谓东南亚防务条约上签字的八个国家中，有五国不是亚洲国家。这个公约替美国干涉亚洲国家的事务提供了一个借口，它也替殖民国家干涉世界那一部分的人民的内政开了方便之门。
    为了确保垄断资本的最大限度的利润，并且为了帝国主义国家的战略目的，马尼拉公约在经济和社会计划的幌子下，导致加紧劫掠东南亚国家的天然资源。
    对于已经签订这个公约的国家内的广大人民和劳动人民来说，这个公约意味着更大程度的贫穷和剥削，意味着民主民族解放运动和争取劳动人民权利的工会运动遭到更血腥的镇压。
    拥有十亿以上人口的绝大多数东南亚国家都不愿参加马尼拉公约。它们痛斥这个公约。它们表示亚洲人民要求建立一种不是以武力为基础的国际关系，并希望自行解决同他们国家有关的问题。
    世界工会联合会确信亚洲人民完全有权利在不受任何外国干涉的情况下创造自己的生活。世界工会联合会欢呼中华人民共和国、印度和缅甸联邦的代表们最近发表的关于亚洲和平共处政策的声明。这些声明对亚洲的民族独立、和平和社会发展是一种重要的贡献。
    世界工会联合会认为，以和平方式扩大亚洲国家之间的联系能保证它们的经济发展和提高广大人民的生活水平。
    世界工会联合会向这些国家的劳动人民为争取和平而进行的英勇斗争致敬，并相信他们将在为实施和平共处，尊重民主、工会权利，改善生活和劳动条件的政策的斗争中加强他们的团结。
    世界工会联合会向亚洲国家的劳动人民表示世界所有工人的充分声援。
