    Hunan Farmers
    More Than Double Rapeseed Planting Area
    This year, Hunan Province plans to more than double the rapeseed planting area compared to last year. Currently, farmers in various regions are busy plowing and sowing, striving to complete the task of expanding the rapeseed planting area according to the national plan in a timely manner.

    Starting in early September, many places in Hunan Province began mobilizing farmers to plant more rapeseed in a planned manner, in order to increase the production of oil for the country. Many farmers in counties such as Xinning, Dongkou, Wugang, Shaodong, and Anhua, under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, have formulated plans to expand the rapeseed planting area based on national needs and their own possible conditions. Farmers in Yunshui Township, Shaodong County, plan to increase the rapeseed planting area by more than five times compared to last year. After discussion, members of the Zeng Zhaochun and Zou Yingkui mutual aid teams in Helin Township, Ningxiang County, realized that planting more rapeseed to produce edible oil can support national industrial construction and supply the lives of urban people, and rapeseed cakes can be used as fertilizer. These two mutual aid teams have increased the original plan of planting eight mu of rapeseed to twenty mu. Farmers in this township did not have the habit of planting rapeseed in the past, but this year they have promoted more than 440 mu. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖南省农民
    扩大油菜种植面积一倍多
    今年湖南省计划油菜种植面积比去年扩大一倍多。目前各地农民正在忙着翻田播种，争取及时完成按照国家计划扩大油菜种植面积的任务。
    九月上旬起，湖南省许多地方就开始动员农民有计划地多种油菜，为国家增产更多的油料。新宁、洞口、武冈、邵东、安化等县许多农民，在农业生产合作社和互助组带动下，都根据国家需要和自己可能条件，订出了扩大油菜种植面积的计划。邵东县云水乡农民计划油菜种植面积比去年扩大五倍多。宁乡县鹤林乡曾昭春、邹映奎两个互助组的组员经过讨论，认识到多种油菜生产食油可以支援国家工业建设和供应城市人民生活需要，菜饼可以做肥料。这两个互助组已由原计划种油菜八亩增加到二十亩。这个乡的农民过去没有种植油菜的习惯，今年推广了四百四十多亩。　（新华社）
