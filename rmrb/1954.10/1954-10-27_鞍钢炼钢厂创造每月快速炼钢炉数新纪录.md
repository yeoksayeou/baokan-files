Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steelmaking Plant workers are deeply engaged in a labor emulation campaign, resulting in an unprecedented increase in the number of rapid steelmaking furnaces. After overfulfilling the state production plan for September in the labor emulation campaign, the plant's workers carefully discussed the experiences and shortcomings of the September labor emulation and revised the October team guarantee plan. They more diligently implemented rapid furnace patching, rapid charging, and rapid smelting, skillfully mastered the temperature of the regenerator, and tried their best to shorten steelmaking time to strive for more rapid steelmaking.

From October 1st to October 20th, in twenty days, they rapidly produced fifty-seven furnaces of steel, an increase of eighteen furnaces compared to September, exceeding the October rapid steelmaking plan by seven furnaces, creating a new record for this year.

The steelmaking plant workers have also put forward new requirements for themselves: to guarantee that they will strive to create a record of one hundred rapid steelmaking furnaces in October on the basis of this new record.

    鞍钢炼钢厂创造每月快速炼钢炉数新纪录
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂职工深入展开劳动竞赛，快速炼钢炉数空前增加。该厂职工在劳动竞赛中超额完成了九月份的国家生产计划之后，又认真地讨论了九月份劳动竞赛的经验和缺点，并修订了十月份小组保证计划。他们更加紧张地实行快速补炉、快速装料和快速熔炼，巧妙地掌握蓄热室的温度，尽量使炼钢时间缩短，以争取更多的快速炼钢。
    十月一日到二十日的二十天中，他们快速炼钢五十七炉，比九月份增多了十八炉，超额七炉完成了十月份快速炼钢的计划，创造了今年以来的新纪录。
    炼钢厂的职工们又给自己提出了新的要求：保证要在这个新纪录的基础上，争取十月份创造一百炉快速炼钢的纪录。
