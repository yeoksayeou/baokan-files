Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: A delegation of six British writers, artists, and scientists, currently visiting China, presented a letter of greetings signed by over six hundred prominent figures in British cultural circles to Chinese literary and scientific workers at a ceremony held here on the morning of the 3rd. The ceremony was presided over by Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.

The delegation leader, Professor Leonard Hawkes, and delegation members Lord Hugh Casson, Professor A.J. Ayer, Stanley Spencer, Rex Warner, and John Dre Chinall attended the ceremony.

The letter of greetings was read and submitted by Professor Leonard Hawkes, the head of the delegation.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, accepted the letter on behalf of Chinese literary, artistic, and scientific circles.

The letter bore the signatures of twenty-eight Fellows of the Royal Society, seventy professors, and five hundred and seventy-four other prominent figures in British cultural circles.

The letter of greetings reads as follows:

We, the undersigned men and women workers in literary and scientific circles, send our respects to you.

We have deep admiration for the achievements of past Chinese civilization. In many areas, we in the West still have much to learn from it. We especially need to know more about the cultural and scientific activities of modern China.

We believe that the exchange of ideas and knowledge between Britain and China, as in the past, will contribute to the future development of literature and science in both countries. We believe that close cultural relations can greatly help to increase mutual understanding and friendship between the two nations. We sincerely hope that the differences that currently threaten to disrupt harmony between our two countries will disappear.

With these goals in mind, we are determined to work to promote the full exchange of science and culture between our two countries. We are confident that we can obtain your cooperation.

The following are among those who signed the letter:

Painters: Augustus John, Graham Sutherland,
Sculptor: Henry Moore,
Philosophers: Bertrand Russell, Canon Raven (Doctor of Divinity) (Fellow of the British Academy)
Composers: Benjamin Britten, Sir Arthur Bliss,
Writers: E.M. Forster, Dylan Thomas (deceased), Arthur Waley, Sean O'Casey, Lord Compton Mackenzie, Professor Day Lewis, Professor Gilbert Murray.
Actress: Sybil Thorndike.
Filmmaker: Basil Wright.
Scientists: Professor J.B.S. Haldane (Fellow of the Royal Society), Professor C.F. Powell (Fellow of the Royal Society), Dr. Joseph Needham (Fellow of the Royal Society), Sir Boyd Orr (Fellow of the Royal Society).
Medical Expert: Sir Weber-Johnson.
Architect and City Planner: Lord Professor Patrick Abercrombie.

Before handing over the letter, Professor Leonard Hawkes said in his address: "Just as the six of us represent more than six hundred people, we firmly believe that these six hundred people represent millions of others who, like us, are eager to make a real effort to expand the exchange of ideas, encourage the flow of knowledge, and promote sympathy and understanding between our two countries."

Professor Leonard Hawkes said: "We hope that today's ceremony will be the beginning of something greater, a step in the direction that is certainly correct – towards a better, more mutually understanding, peaceful and happy world."

He expressed the delegation's gratitude to the Chinese cultural workers. He said: "Thank you for your kind invitation to us to come here from Britain, and thank you for the warm hospitality you have extended to us since we arrived in your country."

In his speech after accepting the letter, Guo Moruo expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the delegation and, through the delegation, to "all friends in British literary and scientific circles."

He pointed out that in the past several centuries, "many outstanding British scientists, writers, and artists have made excellent contributions to human culture. The Chinese people have always valued the excellent culture of the British people and have constantly been learning from it. Cultural figures such as Newton, Darwin, Shakespeare, and Dickens are very familiar to us. Their theories and works are not only the precious spiritual wealth of the British people but also the precious spiritual wealth of the Chinese and world people. Many famous works by British scholars have been introduced to the Chinese people in the past through the hard work of Chinese scholars. After liberation, this work has begun to be carried out on a planned basis on a wider scale. This fully shows that in our new people's country, the crystallization of world culture, just like our own national culture, will be increasingly appreciated by the broad masses."

Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, then spoke. He expressed that he would widely disseminate to Chinese literary and scientific circles the friendly sentiments of British literary and scientific circles and the noble desire to promote cultural exchange between the two peoples. He also asked the delegation to bring back to Britain the same wishes and sincere friendship of Chinese literary and scientific circles.

More than sixty prominent figures in Chinese cultural circles attended the ceremony. They were: Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, Liang Xi, Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, Ding Ling, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, and famous writers, playwrights, musicians, painters, film directors, archaeologists, physicists, biologists, medical experts, university presidents, historians, economists, and linguists, etc.

Professor Hawkes said at a press conference held last night: This letter is a "symbol of friendship" between the British and Chinese peoples. He said that if time were not limited, even more colleagues would have signed the letter.

The delegation flew to Shanghai this afternoon for a visit.

    我们相信英中两国的思想和知识的交流像过去一样是有助于两国文艺和科学将来的发展的。我们相信密切的文化关系能够大大有助于增加两民族间的相互了解和友谊。我们诚挚地希望目前有使我们两国不和之虞的分歧会归于消灭。

    伦纳德·霍克斯教授在开始递交这封信前，致词说：“正如我们六个人代表六百多人一样，我们深信，这六百多个人代表千万个其他的人，这些人和我们一样地渴望应该作出一个真正的努力来扩大思想交流、鼓励知识流通，促进我们两个国家之间的同情和了解。”
    伦纳德·霍克斯教授说：“我们希望，今天的仪式会成为是更重大的事情的开端，是朝着可以肯定是正确的方向——是朝着一个更好的、更相互了解的、和平的和幸福的世界的方向——的一个步骤。”

    他指出，在过去好几个世纪中，“许多卓越的英国科学家、作家和艺术家，对人类文化有很好的贡献。中国人民一向很重视英国人民的优秀文化，而且不断地在进行学习。牛顿、达尔文、莎士比亚和狄更斯等文化名人对于我们是非常熟悉的。他们的学说和作品不但是英国人民宝贵的精神财富，也是中国和世界人民宝贵的精神财富。英国学者的一些有名著作，过去有不少经过中国学者的辛勤努力介绍给了中国人民。在解放以后，这一工作已经在更广泛的规模上开始有计划的进行了。这充分显示着，在我们这个新的人民的国家里，世界文化的结晶，正如我们自己的民族文化一样，将愈来愈受到广大群众的欣赏。”

    霍克斯教授在昨晚举行的记者招待会上曾说：这封信是英中两国人民之间的“友谊的象征”，他说，若不是限于时间，原来还会有更多的同人在这封信上签名。
    代表团已在今天下午飞往上海访问。
