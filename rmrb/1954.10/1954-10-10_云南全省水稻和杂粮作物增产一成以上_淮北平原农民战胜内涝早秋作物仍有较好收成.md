Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th: The clear autumn harvest season sees good news of bountiful harvests spreading throughout the rural areas of Yunnan Province. The province's rice and coarse grain crops will increase by more than 10% compared to last year. Currently, the vast majority of rice in most areas has been fully harvested, generally yielding a 10% increase over last year. Coarse grain crops and mountain crops, for which the planting area was expanded this year, have also had a good harvest.

During the harvest, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Yunnan Province are leading individual farmers to improve harvesting methods. They proposed "meticulous harvesting and threshing, ensuring every grain returns home," to guarantee the overfulfillment of production increase plans. Six counties, including Jiangchuan and Xinping, through harvest technique meetings, have enabled farmers in most areas to harvest in a timely manner. Some areas have farmers repairing bridges and paving roads and inspecting baskets to avoid knocking off grains when carrying the harvested rice. Due to the farmers' improved harvesting methods, Yuxi County and Eshan Yi Autonomous County can increase rice yields by 20 to 30 jin per mu. Yuxi County expects to increase rice yields by more than 440,000 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th: The early autumn crops on the Huaihe Plain, covering over 22.2 million mu, have yielded an average of over 90 jin of grain per mu, with the unit area yield still approaching last year's level.

This summer, coinciding with the extraordinary flood on the Huai River, the Huaihe Plain experienced continuous rainfall of 700 to 800 millimeters, almost equal to the local average annual rainfall, leading to waterlogging in many areas. Thanks to the flood control and drainage projects implemented over the past few years and the construction of tens of thousands of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, and after vigorous drainage efforts by farmers, the accumulated water was quickly discharged from the farmland. Agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations also quickly led individual farmers to strengthen field management. Thus, even in a year of major flooding, the early autumn crops still yielded a good harvest.

    云南全省水稻和杂粮作物增产一成以上
    淮北平原农民战胜内涝早秋作物仍有较好收成
   【新华社昆明九日电】晴朗的秋收季节里，云南省各地农村传播着丰收的喜讯。全省水稻和杂粮作物将比去年增产一成以上。目前绝大部分地区的水稻已全面收割，一般比去年增产百分之十。今年扩大了种植面积的杂粮作物和山区作物也都丰收。
    在收割中，云南省各地农业生产合作社和互助组带动单干农民改进收割方法。他们提出“细收细打，颗粒还家”，保证超额完成增产计划。江川、新平等六个县通过收割技术会议，大部地区农民做到适时收割。有的地区农民修桥铺路和检查箩筐，避免挑谷时拨掉谷粒。玉溪县和峨山县彝族自治区由于农民改进收割方法，每亩可增收稻谷二十斤到三十斤。玉溪县预计共可增收稻谷四十四万多斤。
   【新华社合肥九日电】淮北平原二千二百多万亩早秋作物平均每亩收了九十多斤粮食，单位面积产量仍接近去年水平。
    今年夏天，与淮河发生特大洪水的同时，淮北平原连续降雨七、八百公厘，几乎等于当地历年来的年雨量，因此不少地区形成内涝。由于几年来的治淮除涝工程和数以万计的小型农田水利工程的兴修，经过农民大力排涝，使积水从农田中迅速排泄出去。农业生产互助合作组织又迅速带动单干农民，加强了田间管理。这样，虽在大水之年，早秋作物仍有较好的收成。
