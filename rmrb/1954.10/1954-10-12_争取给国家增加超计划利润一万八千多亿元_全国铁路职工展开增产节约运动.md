To Strive to Increase National Extra-Plan Profits by 1,800 Billion Yuan
National Railway Workers Launch a Production Increase and Conservation Movement

    National railway workers are enthusiastically launching a production increase and conservation movement, striving to increase national extra-plan profits by 1,868 billion yuan.
    The Ministry of Railways, the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways, and the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union jointly convened a national railway telephone conference in early September. Minister Teng Daiyuan delivered a report at the meeting, calling on railway workers across the country to increase production and conserve resources, overfulfill this year's railway production and financial plans, increase national extra-plan profits by 1,868 billion yuan, and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.
    The national railways overfulfilled their transportation tasks in the first half of this year, but in July and August, some lines were affected by floods, and the loading plan was not completed. Increased state expenditures were incurred for the emergency repair of lines and bridges in flood-stricken areas. In order to ensure the completion of railway production increase and conservation tasks, Minister Teng Daiyuan pointed out that all departments of the national railways must strengthen transportation organization, implement the policy of steadily developing full loading, exceeding axle load, and the 500-kilometer movement, continuously improve the efficiency of locomotive and vehicle utilization, and overfulfill transportation plans. In terms of conservation, efforts should be made to save expenses that can be saved under the condition of completing state plans and ensuring quality, and strictly prevent blind conservation practices that reduce equipment quality.
    All railway administrations and railway capital construction departments, based on Minister Teng's call, formulated specific plans and measures for increasing production and conserving resources one after another after mid-September, mobilizing the broad masses of railway workers to actively launch labor competitions. After analyzing the situation of completing the state plan in the past eight months, the Harbin Railway Administration decided to deeply tap internal potential and increase profits remitted to the state by 560 billion yuan. The Tianjin Railway Administration decided to increase profits remitted to the state by 270 billion yuan. The Liuzhou Railway Administration, with a small transportation volume, also decided to increase profits remitted to the state by 19 billion yuan. The railway capital construction departments are committed to overcoming waste and striving to save project costs. The Kanglang Engineering Section of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has already formulated a plan to save 20 billion yuan.
    Various railway grassroots units and hundreds of thousands of railway workers have actively taken action to complete the national railway production increase and conservation tasks. In order to realize the Harbin Railway Administration's plan to increase profits remitted to the state, the employees of the Andong Railway Branch strengthened their ties with various factories and mines, ensuring that 597 wagons are loaded every day in the fourth quarter, while improving locomotive quality and saving fuel. The Shijiazhuang Railway Branch guarantees to complete the loading of 750 wagons every day in order to guarantee the realization of the Tianjin Railway Administration's plan to increase profits remitted to the state. Railway workers in the Wuhan area, who achieved victory in the flood prevention struggle, have invested in the production increase and conservation movement with greater enthusiasm. The lines in the flood-stricken areas of the Beijing-Hankou Railway have resumed normal driving speed ahead of schedule. The Wuchang Ferry Section has improved the efficiency of ferries and decided to save 8 billion yuan in the fourth quarter. Due to the active work of railway workers across the country, the strengthening of contact and cooperation with cargo owners, the strengthening of cargo source organization, the planning of transportation, and the improvement of transportation efficiency, the national railway loading plan for September has been overfulfilled.

    争取给国家增加超计划利润一万八千多亿元
    全国铁路职工展开增产节约运动
    全国铁路职工热烈展开增产节约运动，争取给国家增加超计划利润一万八千六百八十亿元。
    铁道部、铁道部政治部和中国铁路工会全国委员会，在九月上旬联合召开了全国铁路电话会议，滕代远部长在会上做了报告，号召全国铁路职工增产节约，超额完成今年铁路生产、财务计划，给国家增加超计划利润一万八千六百八十亿元，支援解放台湾的斗争。
    全国铁路超额完成了今年上半年运输任务，但是，七、八月份部分线路受到水害，装车计划没有完成；由于抢修水害地区线路桥梁，使国家支出增多。为了保证完成铁路增产节约任务，滕代远部长指出，全国铁路各部门必须加强运输组织工作，贯彻稳步开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的方针，不断提高机车车辆运用效能，超额完成运输计划；节约方面，应在完成国家计划和保证质量的条件下，节省可以节省的开支，严格防止降低设备质量等盲目节约的做法。
    全国各铁路管理局和铁路基本建设部门，根据滕部长的号召，在九月中旬以后，先后订出了增产节约的具体计划和措施，动员广大铁路职工积极展开劳动竞赛。哈尔滨铁路局分析了过去八个月完成国家计划的情况以后，决定深入挖掘内部潜在力量，增加上缴利润五千六百亿元；天津铁路局决定增加上缴利润两千七百亿元；运输量很小的柳州铁路局也决定增加上缴利润一百九十亿元。铁路基本建设部门，保证克服浪费，努力节省工程费用，铁道部第四工程局康狼工程段已订出节省二十亿元的计划。
    各铁路基层单位和数十万铁路职工，已经为完成全国铁路增产节约任务积极行动起来。安东铁路分局职工为了实现哈尔滨铁路局增加上缴利润的计划，加强了与各厂矿的联系，保证第四季度每天完成装车五百九十七车的任务，并提高机车质量、节省燃料。石家庄铁路分局为了保证实现天津铁路局增加上缴利润的计划，保证每天完成装车七百五十车的任务。在防汛斗争中取得胜利的武汉地区铁路职工，又以更大的积极性投入增产节约运动，京汉铁路受水害地区的线路已经提前恢复了正常的行车速度，武昌轮渡段提高了渡船效率，并决定在第四季度节约八亿元。由于全国铁路职工积极工作，加强了与货主的联系和协作，加强了货源组织工作和运输计划性，提高了运输效能，全国铁路九月份装车计划已经超额完成。（吕竹）
