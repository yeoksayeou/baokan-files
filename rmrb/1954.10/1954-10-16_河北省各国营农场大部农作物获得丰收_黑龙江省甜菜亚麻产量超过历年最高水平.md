Major grain crop harvests in state-owned farms in Hebei Province. This year, many state-owned farms in Hebei Province suffered from floods, but thanks to the efforts of the staff to fight the disaster and ensure production, and to strengthen the late-stage management of crops, the output of various crops still greatly exceeded last year. The 12,600 mu of rice in the Hangu and Junliangcheng mechanical farms can produce an average of more than 600 jin per mu. The Hangu farm produced 28 jin per mu more than originally planned. According to statistics from 150 experimental demonstration farms across the province, the average yield of cotton per mu increased by 10% compared with last year, and grain production increased by 12%. The large area of saline-alkali wasteland in the Jiheng mechanical farm has been improved over the past few years, and with the strengthening of technical management of crops, the yield of cotton planted this year is twice that of local farmers. The bumper harvest of crops in state-owned farms has greatly influenced the farmers near the farms. For example, after visiting the farm's bumper harvest, twelve agricultural production cooperatives and two mutual aid groups near the Longguan County Farm voluntarily ordered 35,000 jin of high-quality potato varieties from the farm.

Heilongjiang Province reaped bumper harvests of sugar beet and flax. Both output and quality exceeded the highest historical levels. This year, the province's 54,000 hectares of sugar beet yielded an average of more than 14 tons per hectare. At present, women in the sugar beet production areas near Harbin and Nehe are busy in the fields peeling roots and removing leaves, and large carts carrying sugar beet to sugar factories are constantly moving in teams on the roads. The province planted a total of more than 38,000 hectares of flax, with an average yield of 1,400 kilograms, and the color and fiber are better than in previous years. Among them, 3,600 hectares planted with new agricultural tools yielded an average of 2,000 kilograms. All flax has now been delivered to purchasing stations.

    河北省各国营农场大部农作物获得丰收
    黑龙江省甜菜亚麻产量超过历年最高水平
    河北省各国营农场大部农作物获得丰收。今年河北省很多国营农场遭受了水灾，但由于各场职工努力抗灾保产，加强农作物的后期管理，各种作物的产量仍然大大超过了去年。汉沽、军粮城机械农场的一万二千六百余亩水稻，平均每亩可产六百斤以上，汉沽农场每亩地比原计划多产二十八斤多。据全省一百五十个试验示范农场统计，棉花单位面积产量平均每亩比去年增产百分之十，粮食可增产百分之十二，冀衡机械农场的大部盐碱荒地，经过近几年的改良，和加强作物的技术管理，今年所种棉花的产量，比当地农民多一倍。国营农场的作物丰收，大大影响了农场附近的农民。如龙关县农场附近的十二个农业生产合作社和两个互助组，参观了农场的丰收以后，主动的向农场订换了优良品种的马铃薯三万五千斤。

    黑龙江省甜菜亚麻均获丰收。产量质量都超过了历史最高水平。今年全省五万四千公顷甜菜，平均每公顷产十四吨多。目前，哈尔滨附近和讷河一带甜菜产区的妇女们正在田野里忙着削根去叶，向糖厂运送的大车，在路上一队一队川流不息地运送。全省共种亚麻三万八千多公顷，产量平均可达一千四百公斤，而且色泽纤维都比往年好，其中有用新农具种的三千六百公顷，平均产量二千公斤。现全部亚麻均已送到收购站。
