    Indian Prime Minister Nehru, at the invitation of our government, will visit our country and arrive in Beijing today. This is a major event in the relations between Asian countries. Prime Minister Nehru's visit to our country is an important development in the friendly relations between China and India. This visit will further promote understanding and cooperation between our two great nations and will be of great significance for maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. Our people warmly welcome the arrival of the outstanding statesman of our great neighbor India, Prime Minister Nehru.
    China and India have had a deep friendship since ancient times. A border of nearly three thousand kilometers links our two countries. Century after century, there have only been peaceful cultural exchanges and economic contacts between our two countries, and no wars or hatred. After the founding of the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China, relations between the two countries have undergone new developments. In June of this year, our Premier Zhou Enlai visited India at the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Nehru and jointly issued a joint statement with Prime Minister Nehru. In this statement, the two governments unanimously agreed to take the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence as the basic principles guiding relations between the two countries. The two prime ministers also believe that these Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should also apply to other countries and to general international relations. As Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in his report to the Indian National Congress Parliamentary Party meeting on August 22 this year, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India has made Sino-Indian relations closer.
    The joint statement of the Chinese and Indian prime ministers not only strengthened and developed the friendly relations between China and India, but also pointed out a clear path for establishing collective peace in Asia and the world. The governments and people of China and India are constantly striving to develop economic relations and cultural exchanges between the two countries, and to strengthen close cooperation in the cause of world peace. The recent Sino-Indian trade agreement signed in Delhi is a manifestation of the further development of relations between the two countries.
    The development of friendly relations between China and India has profound reasons. In modern times, China and India have both suffered from foreign colonialism and oppression; the Chinese and Indian people have both struggled for their freedom and independence. Now we have both established our own new countries. Our common desire is to build our respective motherlands in a peaceful environment. Prime Minister Nehru said in a letter to the chairmen of the Indian National Congress Provincial Committees after the meeting between the Chinese and Indian prime ministers:
  “The future development of our country and other Asian countries depends first and foremost on the continued maintenance of peace.” The fundamental policy of the People's Republic of China in international affairs, as pointed out in the preamble to our constitution, is to strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress. This common and ardent desire of China and India to maintain peace constitutes the foundation for developing friendship between the peoples of China and India. Our people value this friendship. The friendship of the nine hundred and sixty million people of China and India is a major force for maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
    Our people have always valued the efforts of large Asian countries like India in the cause of peace. In recent years, India's efforts to maintain peace have occupied an increasingly important position in the world. India has made valuable contributions to achieving the Korean armistice. The Geneva Conference did not reach any agreement on restoring the unification of Korea and consolidating peace in Korea, but countries concerned with a peaceful solution to the Korean issue are continuing their efforts to seek a final solution to the Korean issue. Indian Prime Minister Nehru also stated in his foreign policy speech to the People's House of the Indian Parliament on August 25 this year: "The Geneva Conference should not be allowed to become a thing of the past. Efforts to move forward towards peace in Korea should continue." India has also consistently shown concern for striving to stop the war in Indochina, and has served as the chairman of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Indochina, thus undertaking the important responsibility of maintaining the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement and carrying out effective work. Indian Prime Minister Nehru also actively advocated that Asian countries should cooperate to expand the peaceful areas of Asia. Prime Minister Nehru said in his speech to the Indian Parliament on September 16 this year: "As everyone knows, India's policy is to establish a peaceful area in Asia, and if possible, to establish a peaceful area in other places as well." The joint statement issued by the Indian Prime Minister and the Indonesian Prime Minister after their talks in Delhi in late September also particularly emphasized promoting the cause of world peace, especially the cause of peace in Southeast Asia. Obviously, India's efforts to maintain peace are in line with the interests of the Indian and Asian people. It is playing an important role in promoting the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    At present, the situation in Asia is developing towards a future that is conducive to collective peace. The realization of the Korean armistice and the Geneva Conference's agreement on restoring the Indochina issue are not only great victories for the forces of peace, but also create favorable conditions for establishing collective peace in Asia. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence emphasized by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers' joint statement have been supported and responded to by many Asian countries; peace-loving people all over the world have seen the path to maintaining world peace in these five principles. The peaceful cooperative relationship between China and India and China and Burma based on these five principles has become a model of peaceful cooperation between countries with different social and political systems, especially Asian countries. Asian public opinion believes that the scope of application of these five principles agreed to by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers should be expanded to include other countries. Our Premier Zhou Enlai also pointed out in the government work report he delivered at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of our country that the friendly relations between our country and the Republic of Indonesia can also be further developed based on these principles. It is also believed that the above-mentioned five principles should also apply to the relations between our country and Ceylon, Pakistan, and other Asian countries and to general international relations. There is no doubt that the efforts of Asian countries to promote international peace and cooperation will help consolidate peace in Asia and the world.
    However, the US aggressive bloc is very unwilling to see the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world. Not only do they fundamentally dislike the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence emphasized by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers, but they also dislike the understanding and cooperation between China and India, China and Burma, and between China and other Asian countries. They are trying to create division in Asia and establish aggressive military blocs to re-intensify the tense situation in Asia. The Southeast Asian military alliance planned single-handedly by the United States is a manifestation of the United States continuing to pursue its aggressive policy in Asia. Not only that, but the United States is also attempting to put together Japanese reactionary forces, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to organize a so-called "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance," and is intensifying its support and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in carrying out harassing warfare against our country, hoping to carry out a restoration conspiracy against our mainland. This approach of the US aggressive bloc cannot but arouse the anxiety and unease of Asian countries. Prime Minister Nehru pointed out in his speech to the People's House of the Indian Parliament on September 29 this year when talking about the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty": "The treaty definitely increased the tension and fear of the situation." And he believed that: "The entire approach of the Manila Treaty is not only a wrong approach, but also a dangerous approach."
    What the people of Asian countries need is peace and cooperation, not war and military blocs. This common desire of the people of Asian countries has formed a huge force for maintaining peace. We believe that if Asian countries can establish international cooperative relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, more and larger areas of peace can be established in Asia; these areas will not be reduced to a hotbed for the US aggressive bloc to create war and division in Asia. The people of Asian countries should follow this path, strengthen unity, and strive to establish collective peace in Asia.
    Our people are happy to receive our friend, the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru. We want him to see how we live and how we work. We believe that the Indian people, from their own long experience of struggle, will understand how many difficulties we have experienced in the short five years to achieve this little achievement in order to build our own motherland. Now, we still have many difficulties to overcome, and we still have many shortcomings to correct. We hope that our friends will give us some advice after their visit.
    For the sake of our two countries' peaceful cooperation, for the sake of peace in Asia and the world, long live the friendship between the people of China and India!

### 增进中印友谊，巩固亚洲和世界和平

    增进中印友谊，巩固亚洲和世界和平
    印度总理尼赫鲁应我国政府的邀请，来我国访问，将于今日到达北京，这是亚洲各国关系中的一件大事。尼赫鲁总理对我国的访问，是中印友好关系的重要发展。这次访问将进一步促进我们两大国家间的了解和合作，对于维护和巩固亚洲和世界的和平，将具有重要的意义。我国人民对于我国伟大邻邦印度的杰出的政治家——尼赫鲁总理的到来，表示热烈的欢迎。
    中印两国，自远古以来就有着深厚的友谊。将近三千公里的边界把我们两国联结在一起，经过一个世纪又一个世纪，我们两国之间只有和平的文化交流和经济往来，而没有战争和仇恨。在印度共和国和中华人民共和国成立以后，两国的关系有了新的发展。今年六月，我国周恩来总理应印度尼赫鲁总理的邀请访问了印度，并与尼赫鲁总理共同发表了联合声明。在这个声明中，两国政府一致同意以互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则作为指导两国关系的基本原则。两国总理并认为，这个和平共处的五项原则应该同样适用于其他各国之间和一般的国际关系之中。正如尼赫鲁总理今年八月二十二日在印度国大党国会党团会议上所作的报告中指出的：周恩来总理访问印度使中印关系更加密切了。
    中印两国总理的联合声明，不但加强和发展中印两国的友好关系，并且为建立亚洲和世界的集体和平指出了明确的道路。中印两国政府和人民正不断为发展两国的经济关系和文化交流，为加强在世界和平事业上的密切合作而努力。最近在德里签订的中印贸易协定，就是两国关系的进一步发展的表现。
    中印两国友好关系的发展，是有其深刻的原因的。近代以来，中国和印度同样受到了外国殖民主义的侵略和压迫；中国人民和印度人民都为争取自己的自由和独立进行了斗争。现在我们都已经建立了自己的新的国家。我们的共同愿望，就是在和平环境中建设各自的祖国。尼赫鲁总理在中印两国总理会谈后致印度国大党各省委员会主席的信中说：
  “我国和亚洲其他国家的将来发展，首先要靠和平的继续维持。”中华人民共和国在国际事务中的根本方针，正如我国宪法的序言中所指出的，是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。中印两国维护和平的这种共同的热切愿望，构成了发展中印两国人民间的友谊的基础。我国人民重视这种友谊。中国和印度九亿六千万人民的友谊，是维护亚洲和世界和平的重大力量。
    我国人民一向重视像印度这样的亚洲大国在和平事业上的努力。几年来，印度为维护和平的努力在世界上占有愈来愈不能忽视的地位。对于争取实现朝鲜停战，印度作了有价值的贡献。日内瓦会议对于恢复朝鲜的统一和巩固朝鲜的和平未取得任何协议，但是关心和平解决朝鲜问题的国家为谋求朝鲜问题的最后解决正在继续努力。印度总理尼赫鲁在今年八月二十五日在印度国会人民院发表的外交政策演说中，也曾表示：“不应该容许日内瓦会议成为过去。向朝鲜和平前进的努力应该继续下去。”对于争取停止印度支那战争，印度也一直表现了关怀，并担任了印度支那国际监督和监察委员会的主席，因而承担了维护印度支那停战协议实施的重要责任，进行着有成效的工作。印度总理尼赫鲁并积极主张亚洲国家应该进行合作，以扩大亚洲的和平地区。尼赫鲁总理在今年九月十六日在印度国会的发言中说道：“大家知道，印度的政策是要在亚洲建立一个和平地区，假若可能的话，也在其他地方建立一个和平地区。”今年九月下旬印度总理和印度尼西亚总理在德里举行会谈后发表的联合声明，也特别强调促进世界的和平事业，特别是东南亚的和平事业。很显然，印度为维护和平所作的努力，是符合于印度和亚洲人民的利益的。它对于促进亚洲和全世界的和平事业正起着重要的作用。
    现在，亚洲的局势正在向着有利于集体和平的前途发展。朝鲜停战的实现和日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那问题的协议，不但是和平力量的伟大胜利，并为建立亚洲的集体和平创造了有利的条件。中印两国总理和中缅两国总理联合声明强调的和平共处的五项原则已得到亚洲许多国家的支持和响应；全世界爱好和平人民在这五项原则中看到了维护世界和平的道路。中印和中缅之间在这五项原则的基础上的和平合作关系，已成为不同的社会和政治制度的国家，特别是亚洲国家的和平合作的范例。亚洲各国舆论认为应当扩大中印总理和中缅总理所同意的这五项原则的适用范围，以包括其他国家。我国周恩来总理在我国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中，也曾指出：我国和印度尼西亚共和国的友好关系，也可以根据这些原则得到进一步的发展。并且认为上述的五项原则，应当同样适用于我国同锡兰、巴基斯坦以及亚洲其他国家的关系之中和一般的国际关系之中。毫无疑问，亚洲国家为促进国际和平合作的努力，将有助于巩固亚洲和全世界的和平。
    但是，美国侵略集团却十分不愿意看到亚洲和世界和平的巩固。他们不但根本不欢喜中印总理和中缅总理所强调的和平共处的五项原则，并且也不欢喜中印、中缅之间，以及中国和其他亚洲国家之间的了解和合作。他们力图在亚洲制造分裂，并建立侵略性的军事集团，以重新加剧亚洲的紧张局势。美国所一手策划的东南亚军事联盟，就是美国在亚洲继续推行其侵略政策的表现。不仅如此，美国还企图拼凑日本反动势力、李承晚集团和蒋介石卖国集团组织所谓“东北亚防御联盟”，并加紧支持和援助蒋介石卖国集团对我国进行骚扰性的战争，希图向我国大陆进行复辟阴谋。美国侵略集团的这种做法，不能不引起亚洲国家的忧虑和不安。尼赫鲁总理今年九月二十九日在印度国会人民院的演说中在谈到“东南亚集体防务条约”时就曾指出：“条约肯定地是增加了局势的紧张和恐惧。”并且认为：“马尼拉条约整个做法不但是一个错误的做法，而且是一个危险的做法。”
    亚洲各国人民所需要的是和平和合作，而不是战争和军事集团。亚洲各国人民的这种共同的愿望已形成为巨大的维护和平的力量。我们相信，亚洲国家之间如果能够根据和平共处的五项原则建立起国际合作的关系，在亚洲就可能建立起更多的和更广大的和平地区；这些地区就不致沦为美国侵略集团在亚洲制造战争和分裂的温床。亚洲各国人民应当循着这条道路，加紧团结，为建立亚洲的集体和平而努力。
    我国人民高兴地接待我们的朋友、印度的总理尼赫鲁先生。我们愿意他看到我们怎样生活，怎样工作。我们相信，印度人民从他们自己长期奋斗的经验中，会了解在短短的五年当中，我们为了建设自己的祖国，经历了多少困难才取得这一点点成绩。现在，我们面前还有很多困难需要克服，我们还有很多缺点需要改正，希望我们的朋友在访问之后给我们一些指教。
    为了我们两国的和平合作，为了亚洲和世界的和平，祝中印两国人民的友谊万岁！
