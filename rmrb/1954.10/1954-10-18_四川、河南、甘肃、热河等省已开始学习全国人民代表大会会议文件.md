Sichuan, Henan, Gansu, Rehe and other provinces' government offices, factories, mines and schools have begun to study the documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress.

    Sichuan Province government cadres, factory and mine cadres, and teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools started studying the documents on the 15th. The Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a plan for studying and disseminating the documents on the 9th, and requested that this study and dissemination be closely integrated with the current central tasks, so that cadres and the people would receive another profound patriotic and socialist education, thereby improving their political enthusiasm and work and production. Now, the Party Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Sichuan Provincial People's Government have formulated specific study plans. The Propaganda Department of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also held a special meeting on the 13th to make arrangements, and decided to hold report meetings during the study and invite representatives of the National People's Congress in Chengdu to convey the spirit of the meeting. The cadres are in high spirits and are studying the documents conscientiously. The Sichuan People's Publishing House has recently published 300,000 copies of the "Reference Documents for Studying the National People's Congress" for cadres and the masses to study and refer to.

    Cadres of various provincial-level agencies in Henan Province began reading the documents in early October. On the 13th, Wu Zhipu, a representative of the National People's Congress and Second Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Ji Wenfu, a representative of the National People's Congress, and others conveyed the spirit of the National People's Congress meeting to cadres of the Henan Province and Kaifeng City government offices, various democratic parties, mass organizations, and responsible persons of various counties. The Propaganda Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China then issued a notice to the entire province on the methods, steps, and requirements for study. At present, cadres of agencies directly under the province are conducting in-depth study and discussion on the basis of their original reading of the documents.

    Cadres of agencies, organizations, schools, factories, mines, and troops in various parts of Gansu Province began studying the various documents of the National People's Congress meeting on the 16th. It is estimated that more than 20,000 cadres in Lanzhou City are participating in the study. In order to cooperate with this study, the Gansu People's Publishing House plans to publish 510,000 copies of various separate editions of the documents of the National People's Congress meeting.

    Cadres of province and county-level agencies and people's organizations in Rehe Province began studying the documents in early October. Cadres of provincial-level agencies have finished reading Chairman Mao's opening speech and Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Discussions will be held on the 20th. (Xinhua News Agency)
