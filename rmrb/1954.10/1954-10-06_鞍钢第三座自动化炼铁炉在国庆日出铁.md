Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 1st. Our country's third automated blast furnace produced its first batch of molten iron on National Day. It only took nineteen hours from ignition to tapping, which is five hours shorter than the time it took for the first two automated blast furnaces to produce their first batch of molten iron; the quality of the pig iron is also very good.

　　Since the blast furnace was ignited at 5:00 pm on September 30th, the people in charge of the blast furnace have been reluctant to leave it. Bao Xiuliang, an old worker who has worked by the blast furnace for twenty-one years, said excitedly: This blast furnace uses machines for everything from tapping iron and slag to removing ash. This is the first time in more than twenty years that I have seen such a good furnace!

　　On the morning of October 1st, before dawn, everyone came to the furnace at the same time and immediately busied themselves with preparing to tap the iron. At noon, the workers opened the tapping hole, and the red-hot molten iron flowed slowly and smoothly into the iron trough. Everyone cheered in unison: "Good iron! Good iron!" At this time, it was twelve noon, precisely the moment when the people of the capital were receiving Chairman Mao's review.

    鞍钢第三座自动化炼铁炉在国庆日出铁
    【新华社鞍山一日电】我国第三座自动化炼铁炉在国庆节出了第一炉铁水。这座炼铁炉从点火到出铁一共只花了十九个小时，比以前两座自动化炼铁炉出第一炉铁水的时间缩短了五个小时；生铁的质量也很好。
    自从九月三十日下午五时炼铁炉点火后，掌握这座炼铁炉的人们就不肯离开它。已经在炼铁炉旁工作了二十一年的老工人包秀良激动地说：这个炼铁炉从出铁、出碴一直到出灰全部都用机器工作，二十多年来我第一次看到这样好的炉子！
    十月一日早晨，天还没有亮，大家就不约而同地都到炉子上来了，并且即刻忙着作出铁准备工作。中午，工人们打通出铁口，通红的铁水就缓缓而顺畅地流向铁水槽，大家都不约而同地欢呼起来：“好铁！好铁！”这时候，正是中午十二点，正是首都人民接受毛主席检阅的时刻。
