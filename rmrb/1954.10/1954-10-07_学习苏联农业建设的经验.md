    Learning from the Soviet Experience in Agricultural Construction
    Li Shucheng, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition
    In August and September of this year, we had the honor of being invited by the Soviet government and appointed by the Central People's Government to visit the magnificent Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, as well as collective farms, state farms, tractor stations, and agricultural science research institutes in the vicinity of Moscow, the Krasnodar Krai, and the Rostov Oblast. After returning to China, we also had the opportunity to visit the agricultural pavilion in the Soviet Economic and Cultural Achievements Exhibition in our nation's capital. All members of the delegation and I felt immensely honored. During our visit to the Soviet Union, we had already received comprehensive learning opportunities and gained abundant scientific knowledge and advanced experience. Now, the Soviet government has presented these specific materials to the Chinese people, which will have a significant educational impact on China's agricultural workers and hundreds of millions of Chinese farmers, and will play a tremendous role in China's agricultural construction, which is currently underway.
    From what we saw in the Soviet Union and here in Beijing, the Soviet agriculture was built on the basis of a developed and powerful industry. It is the largest-scale and most mechanized agriculture in the world, where science and technology are widely promoted and applied, production experience is the most abundant, and the collective farm system has achieved glorious victories and is being increasingly consolidated and developed. The agricultural pavilion in the Soviet Economic and Cultural Achievements Exhibition uses physical objects to showcase the achievements of socialist agriculture, the strength of the collective farm system, the solidity of the worker-peasant alliance, and the unparalleled richness of agricultural science and technology and advanced experience. It is an extremely valuable learning treasure for our Chinese agricultural workers and hundreds of millions of farmers.
    From the agricultural pavilion, we see that the Soviet collective farm system has decisive advantages over any private agricultural production. Because the Soviet Union's collective farms are equipped with modern agricultural science and technology, their productivity has greatly increased, the commodity rate has developed to a high level, the public economy is constantly expanding, and the material and cultural life of the collective farmers is improving year by year. For example, the Stalin Collective Farm in the Chuvash Autonomous Republic produced 1.4 tons of spring wheat per hectare from 1944 to 1946, while from 1950 to 1952, it produced 3.58 tons, resulting in a corresponding increase in the commodity rate. The collective farm's cash income also increased year by year. In 1950, the total income of the collective farm was 958,000 rubles; in 1952, it was 1,377,000 rubles; and in 1953, it was 2,677,000 rubles. The public accumulation fund was 1,570,000 rubles in 1950, and increased to more than 2,500,000 rubles in 1953. The expansion of the socialist public economy is an important condition for consolidating and developing collective farms, and the increase in the commodity rate of agricultural products is of great benefit to the country's industrial construction. At the same time, it is also of great benefit to the collective farmers. For example, the labor-day income of this collective farm in 1950 was 1.3 kilograms of grain and 1.3 rubles per labor-day; by 1953, it had increased to 3 kilograms of grain and 6.9 rubles. And in the Lenin Collective Farm we saw near Moscow, the income per labor-day was 40 rubles. As the income of collective farmers increases, their material and cultural life also improves year by year. For example, the Telman Collective Farm in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, introduced in the Soviet Economic and Cultural Achievements Exhibition, harvested an average of 3.46 tons of cotton per hectare on more than 1,000 hectares of land. This only introduces its increase in production. According to what we learned in the Soviet Union, every member of this collective farm has a Victory car. Such a high standard of living is unmatched by farmers in any other country in the world. The road taken by Soviet farmers is glorious and brilliant, and it illuminates the future of Chinese farmers. Our Chinese farmers must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, follow the road taken by Soviet farmers, and, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, advance through semi-socialist cooperatives toward fully socialist cooperatives (collective farms) and a fully mechanized future! This is the only path for farmers to move toward a prosperous and happy life.
    The production of Soviet collective farms is so powerful because, on the one hand, large-scale production can maximize the effectiveness of mechanization, and on the other hand, the state has a strong industrial base that can equip agriculture with modern science and technology. For example, there are currently 1.26 million tractors, 326,000 combine harvesters, and more than 9.5 million other agricultural production tools. These serve 93,000 collective farms and 4,857 state farms on the vast agricultural production front. Currently, the mechanization of autumn plowing has reached 98 percent, grain sowing has reached 91 percent, and grain harvesting has reached 77 percent. In the Lenin Collective Farm and the Stalin State Farm in the Krasnodar Krai, we personally witnessed the harvesting of sunflowers and sugar beets by machine. In the Rostov Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, we saw a large number of corn harvesters being produced. We also saw automatic water dispensers and electric milking machines being equipped in the collective farms and state farms, and the milk production of dairy cows was very high. This time, the Soviet exhibition hall also displayed many new Soviet agricultural machines for us, such as cultivators, sowing machines, harvesters, etc. Seeing these agricultural machines not only aroused our infinite excitement and envy, but also made us think that China's current task must be to build a strong industry so that China's industry can serve our agriculture in the future and produce a large number of agricultural machines. At present, Chinese agricultural workers and farmers must first vigorously promote new agricultural tools to increase the commodity rate of grain and cotton production and fully support the country's industrial construction. The Soviet experience proves that without a strong industrial base, agriculture cannot obtain sufficient modern production tools, and without mechanization of agriculture, it is not only impossible to obtain a stable and abundant yield, but also impossible to reduce the labor of farmers.
    Another aspect we need to learn from the Soviet exhibition hall is agricultural scientific research. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to agricultural scientific research, which has been developed on the basis of close integration of theory and practice. They value inventions and creations, and even more value the production experience of the masses. Here, as we saw in the Soviet Union, the rich production experiences of socialist advanced producers in collective farms and state farms are summarized and widely promoted. The government gives them the highest honor and rewards, and they are respected by the people. I have never seen a farmer like Khoptan (a socialist advanced producer, female, whose corn yield was 21.7 tons per hectare in 1952) being so respected anywhere else. Because advanced producer is the most glorious title, the production enthusiasm and creativity of the masses are encouraged. The "May 1st" Collective Farm in Azerbaijan produced six socialist advanced producers and 346 award winners. The Molotov State Farm in the Krasnodar Krai, introduced in the agricultural exhibition hall, had 23 socialist advanced producers, dozens of medal winners, and hundreds of recipients of merit medals when we visited. All of these were obtained for high yields or inventions and creations. The production experience of Soviet socialist advanced producers is highly valued by the government and scientific research institutions, and their advanced experience enriches and improves the technical content of agricultural production. The "Cultivation and Sowing Methods for Obtaining High and Stable Crop Yields" by T.S. Maltsev, a field cultivation expert from the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm in the Kurgan Oblast and a Stalin Prize winner, is being widely discussed throughout the Soviet Union. Not only scientific research institutions, but also state farms and collective farms are studying and experimenting with every science and technology that is conducive to increasing yields. Scientific research institutions form professional or comprehensive experimental research networks according to the different climate and soil conditions of each region, and carry out experimental research work based on the specific local conditions. At present, agricultural scientific research institutions throughout the Soviet Union have cultivated and promoted 1,673 high-yielding crop varieties and 43 highly productive livestock breeds. And these new varieties have all been proven by the production of collective farms. Secondly, in cultivation methods and the entire production process, they attach great importance to studying how to further maximize the effectiveness of mechanization in order to increase yields and reduce human physical labor; this is what we can see in every collective farm, state farm, or scientific research institute we visit. These experiences and methods provide a working direction for Chinese agricultural scientific researchers and agricultural scientific research institutions, and are worthy of our attention and learning.
    The entire Soviet people are greeting large-scale agricultural construction with boundless confidence and have dispatched 150,000 skilled workers and experts to participate in this work. Within one year (by August 10), they had completed the reclamation of 14 million hectares of virgin and idle land, greatly exceeding the original plan. The scale of Soviet agricultural construction is astonishing. This construction greatly contributes to the cause of world peace; at the same time, only under peaceful conditions can economic construction be vigorously developed, and the material and cultural life of the people be improved and raised. The Chinese people are also building their motherland with the same spirit. When the First Session of the First National People's Congress passed the Constitution, and when the new state institutions became more substantial and the leadership became stronger, Chinese agricultural workers and all farmers further increased their confidence and strengthened their will. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, they are actively working hard to develop agricultural production. At this time, the Soviet government is holding an exhibition in our capital, selflessly introducing their rich experience in agricultural production and advanced scientific knowledge over the past 30 years. In addition to expressing our heartfelt gratitude, we regard it as an extremely valuable treasure house and school for learning scientific knowledge and production experience. Soviet agricultural construction is a glorious example for Chinese agricultural workers, and the road taken by Soviet farmers is the road that all working farmers in the world must take. The great achievements of Soviet agriculture illuminate a bright and brilliant future for Chinese agriculture. Learn from the Soviet Union and build our great motherland.

    学习苏联农业建设的经验
    中国参观苏联农业展览会代表团团长  李书城
    今年八九月间，我们曾荣幸地应苏联政府的邀请，并蒙中央人民政府的委派，参观了宏伟壮丽的苏联农业展览会以及莫斯科近郊与克拉斯诺达尔边疆区、罗斯多夫省等地的集体农庄、国营农场、拖拉机站、农业科学研究所。在归国之后，又有机会在祖国的首都参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中的农业馆，我和赴苏参观的全体团员们都感到无限的荣幸。本来在苏联参观期间，我们就已得到了全面的学习机会，获得丰富的科学知识和先进经验。现在，苏联政府又将这些具体材料陈设在中国人民面前，对中国的农业工作者和亿万中国农民们必将有重大的教育意义，对正在建设中的中国农业必将发挥极大的作用。
    从我们在苏联和我国首都北京参观中所看到的，苏联农业是在发展强大的工业基础上建设起来的，它是世界上规模最大和机械化程度最高的农业，科学技术被广泛的推广和应用，生产经验最丰富，集体农庄制度已获得辉煌的胜利，并正在日益巩固和发展中。苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中的农业馆，就是以实物来展示社会主义农业的成就，集体农庄制度的强大，工农联盟的牢固，农业科学技术与先进经验的无比的丰富。它是我们中国农业工作者与亿万农民极其珍贵的学习宝库。
    从农业馆中，我们看到苏联集体农庄制度比任何私有的农业生产都具有决定意义的优越性。由于苏联是以现代农业科学技术装备起来的集体农庄，所以它的生产率大大增长，商品率已发展到高度水平，公有经济不断的扩大，庄员物质文化生活一年比一年的上升。如楚瓦什自治共和国斯大林集体农庄每公顷春麦在一九四四——四六年产十四公担，而到一九五○—五二年则产三五·八公担，因之商品率随之增长。农庄的现金收入也因而逐年增加，一九五○年这个农庄的总收入为九十五万八千卢布，一九五二年收入一百三十七万七千卢布，一九五三年则收入二百六十七万七千卢布，公积金在一九五○年是一百五十七万卢布，到一九五三年则增至二百五十万多卢布了。社会主义公有经济的扩大是巩固和发展集体农庄的重要条件，而农产品商品率的增加对于国家工业建设是有极大益处。同时，对集体农民也有极大益处，如这个农庄的劳动日报酬，一个劳动日在一九五○年为一·三公斤粮，一·三卢布；到一九五三年则增至三公斤粮，六·九卢布。而我们在莫斯科近郊看到的列宁集体农庄，每个劳动日收入则是四十卢布。随着集体农民收入的增加，其物质文化生活也逐年增长起来。如苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中所介绍的土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国台尔曼集体农庄，在一千多公顷土地上的棉花收成，平均每公顷产三四·六公担，这仅是介绍其增产情况，据我们在苏联所了解的，这个农庄每个庄员家里都有一辆胜利号的小汽车，像这样高的生活水平，是世界上其他任何国家的农民所不及的。苏联农民所走的道路是光辉灿烂的，他照耀着中国农民的前途，我们中国农民一定要学习苏联的先进经验，要走苏联农民所走的道路，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，经过半社会主义的合作社向完全社会主义的合作社（集体农庄）及完全机械化的前途迈进！这是农民走向富裕幸福生活的唯一道路。
    苏联集体农庄的生产是这样强大，其原因，一方面是由于大规模生产，可以高度的发挥机械化的效能，另一方面是由于国家有了强大的工业基础，能以现代的科学技术装备农业，譬如目前已有一百二十六万部拖拉机，三十二万六千部联合收割机和九百五十多万部其他农业生产工具。在广大的农业生产战线上，为九万三千个集体农庄和四千八百五十七个国营农场服务，现在翻耕秋耕机械化已达到百分之九八，谷物播种已达百分之九一，谷物收割已达百分之七七。我们在克拉斯诺达尔边疆区的列宁集体农庄与斯大林国营农场，曾亲眼看到用机器收获向日葵和甜菜。在罗斯多夫农业机器制造厂看到大量的生产玉米收割机。我们也看到在各农庄和国营农场中都在装备着自动引水器和电挤奶器，奶牛的产量都是很高的。这次苏联展览馆中并给我们陈设了很多苏联新式的农业机器，如耕种机，播种机，收割机等等。看到这些农业机器，不仅引起我们无限的兴奋和羡慕；同时也使我们想到中国当前的任务必须建设强大的工业，以便将来中国的工业能为我们农业服务，生产大量的农业机器。而目前中国农业工作者和农民们则须首先大力推广新式农具，以提高粮棉生产的商品率，全力支援国家的工业建设。苏联的经验证明，没有强大的工业基础，农业不可能获得足够的现代化的生产工具，而农业不能机械化，不仅不能获得稳固的丰富的产量，也不能减轻农民的劳动。
    我们需要从苏联展览馆中学习的另一方面，是农业科学研究工作。苏联十分重视农业科学研究工作，它是在理论与实践密切结合的基础上发展起来的。他们重视发明创造，更重视群众的生产经验，在这里我们看到了像在苏联所看到的一样，集体农庄与国营农场中的社会主义先进生产者的丰产经验，被总结和广泛的推广着，政府给他们最高的荣誉和奖励，他们被人们尊敬。我在其他地方从来还没有看到任何一个农民像霍普丹（社会主义先进生产者，女，一九五二年她的玉米每公顷产二一·七吨）这样被人尊敬。由于先进生产者是最光荣的称号，群众的生产积极性和创造性被鼓舞着。阿塞拜疆“五月一日”集体农庄出现了六位社会主义先进生产者，三百四十六人得奖。就是在农业展览馆中介绍的克拉斯诺达尔边疆区莫洛托夫国营农场，在我们去参观时，知道他们农场有二十三位社会主义先进生产者，几十位获得勋章，上百人得功章。所有这些都是因丰产或发明创造而获得的。苏联社会主义先进生产者的生产经验受到政府和科学研究机关的极大重视，他们的先进经验丰富和提高了农业生产的技术内容。库尔干省“列宁遗志”集体农庄的田间耕作学家斯大林奖金获得者Т·С·马尔采夫的“获得作物高额而稳定产量的耕作法和播种法”在苏联各地被广泛的讨论着。不仅科学研究机关，国营农场、集体农庄中也都在研究试验每一项有利于提高产量的科学技术。而科学研究机关则根据各个地区的不同气候土壤条件组成专业的或综合的试验研究网，根据当地的具体情况实事求是的进行试验研究工作。现在全苏农业科学研究机关已育成并推广了一六七三个产量高的农作物品种和四十三种生产能力高的牲畜品种。而这些新的品种并都是经过集体农庄的生产证明了的。其次是他们在栽培方法与整个的生产过程中，都非常重视研究如何使机械化程度进一步发挥效能，以提高产量和减轻人的体力劳动；这是我们不论到那一个集体农庄、国营农场或科学研究所都可以看到的。这些经验和方法，给中国的农业科学研究工作者与农业科学研究机关提供了工作方向，值得我们重视和学习。
    全苏人民正以无限信心迎接大规模的农业建设。派遣了十五万熟练工人和专家参加这项工作。他们已在一年之内（到八月十日）完成了开垦生熟荒地一千四百万公顷，大大超过了原来的计划。苏联农业建设规模的巨大是惊人的。这种建设大大有助于世界和平事业；同时，也只有在和平的条件下才能有力的发展经济建设，改善和提高人民的物质文化生活。中国人民也以同样的心情在建设自己的祖国，当第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过了宪法的时候，当新的国家机构更加充实、领导力量更加增强的时候，中国农业工作者和全体农民们更加提高了信心，增强了意志，在中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的英明领导下积极的努力的发展农业生产。苏联政府又正在这时候在我国的首都举办展览会，把他们三十多年来农业生产的丰富经验和先进的科学知识无私的介绍过来，我们除了表示衷心的感谢之外，并把它当成我们学习科学知识和生产经验的极其珍贵的宝库和学校，苏联的农业建设是我们中国农业工作者的光辉榜样，苏联农民走过的道路，是全世界劳动农民必走的道路，苏联农业的伟大成就给中国农业照耀出光明灿烂的前景。向苏联学习，建设我们伟大的祖国。
