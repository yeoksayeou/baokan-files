    Design Units like the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Construction Design Office Complete Annual Design Tasks, Actively Summarize Experience and Prepare for Next Year's Design Work
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Construction Design Office, the Harbin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau Design Office, the Harbin Railway Design Institute, and the Central Forestry Department Design Company have all successfully completed their design tasks for this year by October 10th, and are now actively preparing for next year's engineering design work.
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Construction Design Office completed the architectural design of more than 60,000 square meters and the electrical design of more than 65,000 square meters by the end of September, and completed the heating and plumbing design task of more than 227,000 square meters in support of Anshan Iron and Steel by October 10th. In order to conscientiously summarize this year's design work, the main forces were organized in early September to go deep into the construction sites to check the problems in the design that were exposed after a year of use of the projects constructed in 1953, and to check the actual situation of the construction in 1954, and more than 300 problems were found. Through this inspection, the designers realized the close relationship between construction and design, and recognized the harm of "building cars behind closed doors" in the past. The Design Office regarded the problems found in the inspection as the main content of summarizing this year's design work to improve the design work, and will start the design work for 1955 from November. The Harbin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau Design Office ended the annual design task of more than 160,000 square meters on October 10th. Based on the low design quality this year, it is preparing to conduct a key summary before October 20th, and start establishing various responsibility systems. In order to carry out next year's design work as soon as possible, it has carried out geological survey work for some projects. The Central Forestry Department Design Company will complete the design of more than 500 kilometers of line engineering for 1955 by the end of this year. In addition to systematically summarizing the experience of the Changda Railway, the Harbin Railway Design Institute has started the design work for 1955. (Li Ye)

    黑龙江省建设厅设计室等单位完成全年设计任务
    积极总结经验并进行明年设计准备工作
    黑龙江省建设厅设计室、哈尔滨市建筑工程管理局设计处、哈尔滨铁路设计事务所、中央林业部设计公司等四个设计单位，到十月十日止已胜利完成了今年的设计任务，现在正积极着手进行明年工程设计的准备工作。
    黑龙江省建设厅设计室在九月末全部完成了六万多平方公尺的建筑设计，和六万五千多平方公尺的电气设计，并在十月十日完成了支援鞍钢的二十二万七千多平方公尺的水暖设计任务。为了认真总结今年的设计工作，九月初便组织主要力量深入工地，检查了一九五三年施工的工程经过使用一年所暴露出来的设计中的问题，并检查了一九五四年施工的实际情况，共检查出三百多个问题。通过这次检查，使设计人员认识到施工和设计的紧密关系，认清了过去坐在屋里“闭门造车”的害处。设计室把检查出来的问题，作为总结今年设计工作的主要内容，以提高设计工作，并将从十一月开始进行一九五五年的设计工作。哈尔滨市建筑工程管理局设计处，在十月十日结束了全年的十六万多平方公尺的设计任务，正根据今年设计质量不高的情况，准备在十月二十日前进行重点总结，着手建立各项责任制度，为及早进行明年的设计工作，已进行了部分工程的地质勘测工作。中央林业部设计公司，将在今年年底全部结束一九五五年的五百多公里线路工程设计。哈尔滨铁路设计事务所，除进行系统的总结中长路经验外，已开始了一九五五年的设计工作。　（李晔）
