Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, October 6th: Hebei Province, a major cotton-producing area in China, has completed its preparations for the new cotton procurement season. The state-owned China National Cotton, Yarn & Fabrics Corporation and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative have conducted detailed studies of this year's cotton production and procurement plans for the entire province, and have adjusted the number of cotton purchasing stations based on the new national planned cotton procurement policy. According to incomplete statistics from Handan, Shijiazhuang, and five other special districts, there are more than 1,200 cotton purchasing stations. In order to ensure that new cotton is supplied to the textile sector in a timely manner, 72 power plants and 185 manual processing stations have been established in Handan, Shijiazhuang, and five other special districts, one municipality, and the Fengfeng Mining Area. There are also plans to organize more than 15,800 manual cotton gins. In some special districts and counties, state-owned China National Cotton, Yarn & Fabrics Corporation and cooperatives have signed transportation agreements with local transportation departments. In terms of cotton inspection, over a thousand people were trained in the province to grade cotton as early as the end of August. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has distributed a large number of scientific instruments for testing cotton, such as electric drying ovens, electrical moisture meters, and microscopes, as well as more than 1,800 sets of seed cotton standard samples, to cotton purchasing units at all levels. The 450 sets of lint standard samples supplied to Hebei Province by the North China Fiber Inspection Institute have also been distributed to various cotton purchasing units.
    Currently, farmers in Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and other special districts, where new cotton is harvested earlier, are widely selling new cotton to the state. The Handan Special District can purchase 2.5 million jin of seed cotton every day.

    河北省收购新棉的准备工作已经就绪
   【新华社保定六日电】我国主要棉产地区河北省新棉收购准备工作已经就绪。国营花纱布公司和省供销合作总社对今年全省棉花产量、收购计划已做了详细研究，并根据今年棉花由国家计划收购的情况调整了收棉站。据邯郸、石家庄等七个专区的不完全统计，共设收棉站一千二百多个。为了使新棉及时供应纺织部门，邯郸、石家庄等五个专区、一个市和峰峰矿区等地已建立动力厂七十二个，人力加工站一百八十五个，并计划组织人力轧花车一万五千八百多辆；有些专区、县的国营花纱布公司、合作社已和当地运输部门订立了保运协议合同。在棉花检验方面，早在八月底全省就训练出一千多名检验棉花等级的人员；省供销合作总社已把大批用以检验棉花的电烘箱、电感测湿器、显微镜等科学仪器和一千八百多套籽棉标准样品分发到各级收棉单位，华北纤维检验所供给河北省的四百五十套皮棉标准样品也已分发到各收棉单位。
    目前，新棉收获较早的邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区的农民已普遍向国家出售新棉。邯郸专区每天可收购籽棉二百五十万斤。
