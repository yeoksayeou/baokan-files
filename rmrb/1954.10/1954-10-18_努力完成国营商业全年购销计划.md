    Strive to Fulfill the State-Owned Commercial Annual Purchasing and Marketing Plan

    The implementation of the state-owned commercial purchasing and marketing plan has been very poor since July this year. The purchase plan for the third quarter was only 93.93 percent completed, and the sales plan was only 88.26 percent completed. Neither the purchase nor the sales tasks for the third quarter were completed, and the sales task was completed even worse. This situation has already had some adverse effects. All staff of state-owned commercial departments must work hard to change this situation, seize the opportunity, and strive to complete the annual purchasing and marketing plan in the last quarter of this year.

    There are many reasons why the state-owned commercial purchasing and marketing plan for the third quarter was not completed, the most important of which is that the work of the state-owned commercial departments has not been able to fully adapt to the changes in the domestic market, and some staff of state-owned commercial departments still do not fully understand these changes.

    What changes have taken place in the domestic market? With the development of planned purchasing and planned supply, and the development of processing orders and unified purchase and sales, state-owned commerce has been able to control all or most of the major commodities related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, thus fundamentally changing the position of state-owned commerce and making it the leading force in national commercial activities. State-owned commerce bears an even greater responsibility to the market. It must assume the responsibility of planning and arranging the entire domestic market, and must determine the commodity circulation plan based on the balance between social purchasing power and social commodities, the operating ratio and mutual relationship between state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce and private commerce, in order to expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, adapt to the requirements of national economic development, and better serve production and people's consumption.

    However, some comrades still do not clearly understand the responsibility of state-owned commerce to the market. They see that the growth rate of consumer goods production in our country is not keeping up with the growth rate of people's consumption, and that the supply of several consumer goods in the market cannot meet the demand, and they mistakenly believe that "the less we sell, the better" and "it doesn't matter if we don't complete the plan." This idea is obviously wrong. Precisely because there is a shortage of several commodities in the market, this further increases the responsibility of state-owned commerce for market supply. For commodities that are planned and controlled by the state for sale, the sales task should be completed in accordance with the state's sales plan, and attention should be paid to customers' preferences for the variety, color, and specifications of these commodities, and the organization and supply of these commodities should be strengthened; for commodities that can generally balance production and sales and currently have a large inventory, we should actively promote and expand sales beyond the plan. Only in this way can we guarantee the basic needs of the people and be conducive to the stability of industrial and agricultural production and market prices. Making excuses that several commodities are in short supply in the market and not actively doing a good job in supply is actually a manifestation of irresponsibility to the market and irresponsibility to the people's lives; we must oppose this wrong idea and practice.

    In the situation where the growth rate of consumer goods production in our country is not keeping up with the growth rate of people's consumption, in order to ensure the state's purchase of agricultural products, strengthen mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, industrial products must be given priority to the countryside. However, some comrades have not implemented this policy in their thinking or in actual implementation. The most prominent situation at present is that many commodities remain in the central wholesale stations and secondary wholesale stations, and even some commodities are backlogged, while the third-level wholesale stores do not have a complete range of commodities and cannot meet the requirements of state-owned retail stores, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, and private retailers for purchasing goods. The emergence of this phenomenon is due, on the one hand, to the fact that the state-owned commercial wholesale system has not promptly checked, discovered problems, changed this situation, and strengthened the connection between lower-level companies and stores to sell industrial products suitable for rural sales to supply people's needs; on the other hand, some regions emphasize the promotion of local industrial products and are unwilling to sell more industrial products from large cities. As a result, local products cannot meet the needs of local people, while products from large cities are backlogged in central wholesale stations and secondary wholesale stations. This has created the abnormal phenomenon that urban industrial products are generally staying in central wholesale stations and secondary wholesale departments, while rural industrial products are out of stock. According to the statistics of the China Department Store Company, the commodities stored in major cities and purchasing and supply units in mid-August accounted for 43 percent of the total inventory; Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Sichuan, Guangdong and more than a dozen other provinces have recently experienced varying degrees of large inventories in provincial wholesale stations and stockouts in grassroots stores. If this phenomenon is not quickly corrected, it will not only seriously affect the completion of the state-owned commercial purchasing and marketing plan, but will also seriously affect the upcoming large-scale agricultural product purchasing campaign. Therefore, the policy of giving priority to supplying industrial products suitable for rural needs to the countryside must be resolutely implemented, and the work of organizing industrial products to go to the countryside to support the purchase of agricultural products must be done well. In order to do this work well, it is also necessary to conduct investigations and research, analyze the situation, and combine it with guiding farmers' consumption, and promptly replenish the quantity and variety of commodities suitable for rural needs in grassroots retail units. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent the tendency of blindly transferring some commodities that are not suitable for rural needs and can only be sold in cities to the countryside.

    The state-owned commercial purchasing and marketing plan must be formulated based on the responsibilities of state-owned commerce to the market, the policy of leading cooperative commerce to carry out business and implementing the utilization, restriction, and transformation of private commerce, and the requirements of national economic development. However, some comrades currently lack a deep understanding of this point and are not good at organizing various commercial forces, expanding the entire social commodity circulation, and completing the purchasing and marketing plan. It must be pointed out that the expansion of sales by state-owned commerce is consistent with the expansion of the entire social commercial circulation, because only by actively expanding the entire social commodity circulation can we guarantee the completion of the state-owned commercial purchasing and marketing plan. Only by rationally allocating goods to state-owned retail companies, cooperatives, state capitalist commerce, and private vendors, actively organizing and helping cooperatives expand sales, and correctly utilizing private merchants, can we achieve the goal of expanding commodity circulation and ensure the completion of the purchasing and marketing plan.

    The task of state-owned commerce is arduous, and new problems arise at any time due to changes in market conditions. This requires leaders at all levels of state-owned commerce and all staff to study hard, be honest, diligent, and earnest, and avoid any exaggeration and pride, and do a good job in commercial work. It is undeniable that the current level of business thinking in our state-owned commercial system is not keeping up with the requirements of the development of objective conditions and the requirements of the state for the tasks of state-owned commerce. This requires the state-owned commercial system to strengthen political and ideological leadership and strive to improve the level of thinking. When assigning tasks, leaders at all levels of state-owned commerce must repeatedly explain the policies to the staff and closely combine political and ideological leadership with business leadership; after the tasks are assigned, they must promptly and effectively check and supervise; only in this way can the cadres in the state-owned commercial system continuously improve their understanding of the tasks of state-owned commerce in the transition period and its importance, so that there will be no deviations in the implementation of the commercial policies of the Party and the state, and the work of state-owned commercial departments can keep up with the changes in the domestic market and adapt to objective requirements.

    There are only more than two months left until the end of the year. Although the Yangtze River and Huai River basins suffered floods this year, most non-disaster areas can increase production beyond the plan. This year's grain and cotton output can still exceed the level of 1953. The currency issued by the state for purchasing agricultural products this year is more concentrated in rural areas and earlier in time than in previous years; due to the implementation of planned supply of cotton cloth, a considerable part of the purchasing power will be transferred to other industrial products, especially daily necessities. These are objectively favorable factors for completing this year's purchasing and marketing plan. As long as state-owned commercial departments at all levels strengthen political, policy, and business leadership, mobilize and rely on the masses of employees, put forward goals to strive for based on the actual conditions of each region and company, organize labor competitions, overcome difficulties, and work hard to do a good job in the unified purchase and purchase of agricultural products; according to policy requirements and supply conditions, strive to expand the sales of industrial products, especially to enable more industrial products to go to the countryside; strive to improve business management and reduce commodity circulation costs; we will certainly be able to further advance the work of state-owned commerce, and we will certainly be able to make due contributions to completing the annual purchasing and marketing plan.

### 努力完成国营商业全年购销计划

    努力完成国营商业全年购销计划
    今年七月以来，国营商业购销计划的执行情况十分不好。第三季度的收购计划只完成百分之九十三点九三，销售计划只完成百分之八十八点二六，第三季度收购和销售任务都没有完成，而销售任务完成得更差。这种情况，已经产生了一些不良的影响。国营商业的全体工作人员，必须努力改变这种状况，抓紧时机，在今年最后一个季度中，力争完成全年的购销计划。
    国营商业第三季度购销计划没有完成的原因很多，其中最重要的一点，就是国营商业部门的工作还没有能够同国内市场的变化完全适应，国营商业的某些工作人员，对这种情况变化也还认识不足。
    目前国内市场起了怎样的变化呢？随着计划收购和计划供应工作的发展和加工订货、统购包销的发展，国营商业已经可以掌握有关国计民生的主要商品的全部或大部，因而从根本上改变了国营商业的地位，成为全国商业活动的领导力量。国营商业对市场所负的责任也更加重大，它必须担负起计划和安排全部国内市场的责任，必须根据社会购买力和社会商品之间的平衡，根据国营商业、合作社商业和私营商业的经营比重和相互关系，决定商品流转计划，决定对整个私营商业的改造和安排的步骤，以扩大城乡物资交流，适应国民经济发展的要求，更好地为生产和人民消费服务。
    但目前有的同志对国营商业对市场所负的责任还认识不清。他们看到目前我国消费品生产增长速度赶不上人民消费增长速度，市场上若干种消费品供不应求的现象，就错误地以为“越少卖越好”、“完不成计划也不要紧”。这种想法显然是不对的。正因为市场上出现了若干种商品供不应求的现象，这才更加加重了国营商业对市场供应的责任。对于国家计划供应和掌握出售的商品，应该按照国家的销售计划完成销售任务，并应注意顾客对这些商品品种、花色、规格的喜好，加强这些商品货源的组织工作和供应工作；对于一般产销能平衡的以及目前库存尚多的商品，应积极推销和超计划扩大推销，只有这样，才能保证人民的基本需要，才有利于工农业生产和市场物价的稳定。借口市场上若干种商品供不应求，就不去积极做好供应工作，实际上是对市场不负责任的表现，对人民生活不负责任的表现；我们必须反对这种错误的想法和做法。
    在我国消费品生产增长速度赶不上人民消费增长速度的情况下，为了保证国家对农产品的收购，加强城乡互助，巩固工农联盟，必须把工业品优先供应给农村，但目前有的同志在思想上、在实际执行中还没有贯彻这一方针。目前最突出的情况是：不少商品停留在中央批发站和二级批发站，甚至部分商品有积压现象，但三级批发商店的商品则品种不全，无法满足国营零售商店、基层供销合作社和私营零售商进货的要求。这种现象的产生，一方面由于国营商业批发系统中没有及时检查，发现问题，改变这种情况，加强下层公司、商店的联系，求得把适合农村销售的工业品批售出去，来供应人民需要；另一方面还有某些地区强调推销本地工业产品，而不愿多销大城市的工业产品，结果本地的产品满足不了当地人民的需要，而大城市的产品却积压在中央批发站和二级批发站。这就造成目前较普遍地存在着城市工业品停留在中央批发站和二级批发部门而农村工业品脱销的不正常现象。根据中国百货公司统计，八月中旬各大城市和采购供应单位存放的商品就占总存量的百分之四十三；江苏、河南、河北、山西、四川、广东等十几省最近都程度不同地存在着省级批发站库存商品雄厚而基层商店商品脱销的现象。这种现象如果不迅速纠正，不仅会严重地影响国营商业购销计划的完成，并将严重地影响即将开展的大规模的农产品收购运动。所以，适合农村需要的工业品优先供应农村的方针必须坚决贯彻，组织工业品下乡支持农产品收购的工作必须做好。为了做好这项工作，还必须通过调查研究、分析情况并结合指导农民消费，及时充实基层零售单位适合农村需要的商品数量和品种，同时也要防止把一些不适合农村需要，只能在城市销售的商品盲目地调运到农村中去的偏向。
    国营商业的购销计划，必须是根据国营商业对市场所负的责任、根据领导合作社商业开展业务和贯彻对私营商业的利用、限制和改造的政策、以及国民经济发展的要求制订的。但目前有的同志对这一点缺乏深刻的认识，不善于组织各种商业力量，扩大整个社会商品流转，完成购销计划。必须指出，国营商业扩大推销是与扩大整个社会商业流转相一致的，因为只有积极扩大整个社会商品流转，才能保证国营商业购销计划的完成。只有对国营零售公司、合作社和国家资本主义商业、私商小贩合理分配货源、积极组织和帮助合作社扩大推销和正确的利用私商，才能达到扩大商品流转的目的，也才能保证完成购销计划。
    国营商业的任务是繁重的，而市场情况的变化又随时出现新的问题。这就要求国营商业的各级领导以至全体工作人员努力学习，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，把商业工作做好。不可否认：我们国营商业系统现有的经营思想水平，是赶不上客观情况发展的要求和国家对国营商业任务的要求的。这就要求国营商业系统必须加强政治思想领导，努力提高思想水平。国营商业各级领导在布置任务的时候，必须反复地向职工讲明政策，把政治思想领导和业务领导密切结合起来；任务布置以后，必须及时有效地检查和督促；这样才能使国营商业系统中的干部对过渡时期国营商业的任务和它的重要性的认识不断提高，才能在贯彻执行党和国家的商业政策中不致发生偏差，才能使国营商业部门的工作赶上国内市场的变化而适应客观要求。
    现在到年终只有两个多月了。今年虽然长江流域和淮河流域遭受了水灾，但大部非灾地区可超计划增产。今年的粮食和棉花产量仍可超过一九五三年的水平，国家今年收购农产品对农村投放的货币较往年集中而且在时间上提前；由于棉布实行了计划供应，相当一部分购买力将转移到其他工业品、特别是日用百货方面去，这是完成今年购销计划在客观上的有利因素。只要各级国营商业部门加强政治上、政策上和业务上的领导，发动和依靠职工群众，根据各地区、各公司的实际情况，提出奋斗目标，组织劳动竞赛，克服困难，努力作好农产品统购和收购工作；根据政策要求与货源情况，努力扩大工业品的推销，特别是使更多的工业品下乡；努力改善经营管理，降低商品流转费用；我们就一定能够把国营商业工作向前推进一步，一定能够为完成全年购销计划做出应有的成绩。
