The Shanghai Coal Industry Building Materials Company Promotes Coal Saving Experience in Factories
	Coal Consumption in September Reduced by More Than Nine Percent Compared to August
	The state-owned Shanghai Coal Industry Building Materials Company focused on promoting coal-saving work in more than 270 public and private factories in the city with monthly coal consumption of more than 100 tons in September, and has achieved significant results. According to preliminary statistics, coal consumption in September was reduced by 9.25 percent compared to August, and more than 10,000 tons were saved compared to the same period last year.
	The coal-saving work in Shanghai started in June this year. The Shanghai Coal Industry Building Materials Company first learned about the coal consumption of 30 coal-consuming industries such as textile, rubber, paper making, and glass in 1953, and conducted investigations and research in 31 factories of different types. It organized more than ten days of coal-saving experiments with new operating methods with emphasis on key points. The results were good. The highest could save 36 percent, and the lowest could save 14.8 percent, with an average saving of 21 percent. Based on this situation, starting from September, the experience of saving coal was generally promoted in more than 270 public and private factories in the city with monthly coal consumption of more than 100 tons. During the promotion process, the leaders and workers of each factory attached importance to the coal-saving work. After the leading cadres of the state-owned Shanghai No. 13 Cotton Textile Factory widely publicized the significance of saving coal among the workers, the factory saved another 17 percent of coal in September on the original basis. Ma Qichang, a worker at the joint public-private Yuhua Textile Factory, found a way to modify the flue of the boiler hot water discharge, which increased the water temperature and saved more than 5 percent of coal. The employees of the Daming Paper Mill came up with many improvement methods to save coal, so that coal consumption in September was reduced by 19.73 percent compared to August, and the product quality was guaranteed. However, at present, many factories still believe that "saving coal is a trivial matter and not worth the effort," or have the mistaken idea of ​​opposing saving coal with other work, which urgently needs to be corrected.

    上海煤业建筑器材公司在工厂中推广节约用煤经验
    九月份用煤较八月份节约百分之九以上
    国营上海煤业建筑器材公司九月份在全市月用煤百吨以上的二百七十多家公、私营工厂中重点开展节约用煤工作，已获显著成绩。据初步统计，九月份较八月份用煤节约百分之九点二五，比去年同期用煤节约一万多吨。
    上海市节约用煤工作是从今年六月份开始的，上海煤业建筑器材公司首先了解了纺织、橡胶、造纸、玻璃等三十个用煤行业一九五三年用煤情况，并在不同类型的三十一家工厂中进行了调查研究，有重点地按新操作法组织了十余天的节约用煤试验，成绩良好，最高的可节约百分之三十六，最低的也节约百分之十四点八，平均节约达到百分之二十一。根据这一情况，自九月份起开始在全市月用煤百吨以上的二百七十多家公、私营工厂普遍推广节约用煤的经验。在推广过程中，各厂领导上和职工都重视节约用煤工作，国营上海第十三棉纺织厂的领导干部在工人中广泛地宣传了节约用煤的意义以后，该厂九月份在原有基础上又节约用煤百分之十七。公私合营裕华纺织厂的工人马其昌想办法改装了锅炉热水排的烟道，提高了水温，节约用煤达百分之五以上。大明造纸厂的职工为了节约用煤想了很多改进办法，使九月份用煤较八月份节约百分之十九点七三，并保证了产品质量。但目前仍有不少工厂仍认为“节约煤是小事，值不得化大力气”，或把节约用煤与其他工作对立起来的错误思想，急待纠正。　（李峻峰）
