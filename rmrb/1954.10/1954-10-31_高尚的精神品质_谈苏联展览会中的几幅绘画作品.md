Noble Spiritual Qualities – On Several Paintings from the Soviet Exhibition
    Li Qun

Soviet painting, inheriting the excellent tradition of realism from the 19th-century Peredvizhniki (Wanderers) school, has achieved brilliant success under the wise leadership of the Soviet Communist Party in expressing the noble spiritual qualities of the Soviet people using the method of socialist realism.

For decades, the Soviet Communist Party has cultivated new thoughts and feelings in the Soviet people, enhanced their patriotic spirit, and educated them to treat the surrounding things with a communist attitude. This has led to the growth of new and beautiful human emotions and qualities among the Soviet people, the emergence of socialist labor viewpoints, and new relationships between people... All of these constitute the social basis for Soviet artists to express the noble spiritual qualities of the Soviet people.

The paintings exhibited at the "Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction," currently being held in Beijing, although only a small part of the excellent Soviet art works, allow us to see the efforts and achievements of Soviet painters in this area.

Soviet painters not only create the great images of Lenin and Stalin in their paintings to educate the people, but also excel at discovering and expressing the noble spiritual qualities of ordinary people, as well as their typical and positive characteristics, creating bright artistic images worthy of being models and objects of emulation for others.

Among the works depicting the sublime spiritual qualities of leaders, Fyodor Savelyevich Shurpin's oil painting "The Morning of Our Motherland," which won the Stalin Prize in 1948, left me with an extremely deep impression. Shurpin painted a half-length portrait of Stalin, and by portraying Stalin's true face and great thoughts and feelings, and by depicting the environmental background that is extremely important for expressing the theme, he made this work have profound and rich ideological content.

The leader's image painted by the artist here is not merely a superficial resemblance, but rather a depiction of Stalin's facial features and his spiritual essence. This is the image of a giant with a far-sighted vision and a broad mind, a revolutionary teacher with rich thoughts and great spiritual courage who dares to overthrow the old world, a strong and calm leader of the working class who is wholeheartedly dedicated to the happiness of the people. Facing this image, we can appreciate Stalin's noble spiritual qualities, and we feel that this is exactly the Stalin in our hearts.

"The Morning of Our Motherland" is an extremely bright oil painting depicting Stalin in a white coat standing on the endless fields of the Soviet collectivized and electrified countryside on a fresh spring morning, with his coat draped over his arm. His solemn face and majestic figure are illuminated by the golden morning sun, and he looks forward with wise and intelligent eyes. "The Morning of Our Motherland" symbolizes the ever-increasing prosperity and strength of the Soviet state; the vast and expansive wilderness in the background, as well as Stalin's broad mind and his expression of looking to the future, are like the prospects of communism unfolding before the Soviet people.

Among the exhibited works, many successfully express the noble qualities of the Soviet Red Army. For example, Pyotr Alexandrovich Krivonogov's "Defenders of the Brest Fortress." This painting depicts the scene on June 22, 1941, when fascist bandits began their frantic attack on Brest and were met with a head-on blow by the Soviet Red Army. In order to depict the scene in accordance with historical truth, the painter carefully studied all the materials of the Brest Fortress defenders and personally went to the battle site at the time, where he made many sketches. Through the collapsed buildings and walls full of bullet marks, as well as the rubble mixed with the corpses of the enemy, the painter expressed the intensity of the battle and the Red Army's tenacity in holding its ground here; through the heroic images of those who were wounded and continued to fight, their boundless hatred for the enemy, and their heroic posture, he expressed the Red Army soldiers' iron will and high patriotism, their courageous spirit of self-sacrifice, and the excellent moral qualities they displayed in the face of the enemy.

Viktor Grigorievich Puzyrkov, Honored Artist of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and Stalin Prize winner, painted "Black Sea Sailor," which is also an oil painting with a revolutionary historical theme full of patriotism. It depicts the scene of Soviet sailors jumping from their boats into the sea with submachine guns in hand, rushing to the shore in the battle to enter the hero city of Sevastopol. The cloudy sky and the huge waves crashing against the shore in the background further enhance the battle atmosphere of the picture. The painter expresses the infinite courage and indomitable spirit of the Soviet sailors.

Alexander Mikhailovich Gerasimov, People's Artist of the Soviet Union, President of the Soviet Academy of Arts, and multiple Stalin Prize winner, painted "Group Portrait of Painters," which is an outstanding portrait. In this painting, the appearances and demeanors of four senior Soviet painters of the older generation, including Isaak Israilevich Brodsky, Vasily Nikolayevich Baksheev, Vitold Kaetanovich Byalynitsky-Birulya, and Vasily Nikolayevich Meshkov, are painted with extraordinary vividness and realism. Their simple, amiable, optimistic spirit and robust physique possess the temperament and characteristics of the Russian people, and also display the will and perseverance of the artistic masters. Gerasimov himself is also a senior Soviet painter, and it is precisely because of this that he was able to excellently depict the noble spiritual appearance of the four old painters in this painting.

In terms of expressing the noble spiritual qualities of Soviet women, what impresses me deeply is "Tanya" created collectively by the Kukryniksy trio. Tanya is an anti-fascist heroine admired by people all over the world, and every viewer is familiar with her life story. In this painting, the painters express Tanya's great spirit of not fearing difficulties and regarding death as going home for the benefit of the people, for the justice of mankind, and for the dignity of the motherland, through the heroic image of Tanya standing straight on the gallows before her execution, clenching her fists tightly. At the same time, the painters also truthfully expressed the despicable fear shown by the German fascist bandits in front of Tanya's heroic and unyielding giant statue, thus forming a clear contrast between justice and injustice, between light and darkness. The gray sky and the white snow on the ground, as well as the gallows standing in the center of the picture, further create a desolate and somber tone for the entire picture. In order to create this work, the painters conducted investigations and research at the location where Tanya was sacrificed – the village of Petrishchevo – so that the depicted plot and environmental background would conform to the actual situation at the time. Now, Tanya's name has become a symbol of revolutionary heroism for all progressive mankind, and the image of Tanya created by the painters in this painting is fully capable of embodying her great spiritual qualities. She is a role model for every one of our revolutionary fighters.

Among the works expressing the beautiful emotions and qualities of Soviet women, Pyotr Mikhailovich Nimensky's "Our Sisters," created in 1952, also impressed me deeply. Nimensky is a military painter at the Grekov Studio in Moscow and a Stalin Prize winner. He had a rich battlefield life during the Soviet Patriotic War. In this painting, two female nurses working in a temporary field hospital are depicted. In the room next to their studio, there are many wounded Red Army soldiers sleeping in their beds. It is just dawn at this time, and the lamp on the table, which has not been extinguished all night, is still lit. A female nurse on the night shift is sitting under the lamp wrapping bandages in her white work clothes. Sitting opposite her is a female nurse who is not wearing work clothes, probably because she has already finished her night shift. She is dozing off against the wall, with a submachine gun next to her, as well as a medical bag used for battlefield rescue. The entire room is extremely quiet, and we seem to be able to hear the groans and snores of the wounded in the next room, as well as the sound of guns and artillery from the distant battlefield. The painter sings the praises of the Soviet women who worked diligently for the motherland during the Patriotic War. Although I lack battlefield experience, this painting can still evoke many associations in me. From the plot of the picture, we can understand how hard they work in their respective positions and how responsible they are. The nurse depicted by the painter who is dozing off against the wall makes us feel her hard work, while the nurse who is looking up at the window also makes us feel her concern for the battlefield. She looks at the dawn shining in from the window, as if she sees the dawn of victory. When we look at such pictures, we are always moved by the noble spirit of these two nurses. And this is precisely where the power of socialist realism painting lies.

Viktor Yefimovich Tsigal's charcoal drawing "The Calf Was Born" depicts an extremely ordinary life scene in a Soviet collective farm, but it is also a poetic scene. Everything expressed in this painting is full of emotion, and all life makes us feel loved. A female veterinarian has assisted in the birth of a calf, and now the calf has been successfully born. She wipes her hands and looks at the movements of this pair of creatures, showing her endless joy and her extreme love for these two cows. Behind her stands another woman, who is the collective farm's feeder. She is happy that the collective farm has increased its new wealth. The work of these two women is extremely ordinary work in the Soviet state, and they themselves are the most ordinary Soviet people, but it is on these ordinary women that, through Tsigal's depiction, we see their meticulous care for the socialist public property of the Soviet state. This beautiful feeling and quality is a reliable guarantee for the consolidation and development of the socialist system.

The extremely bright work "We Are Going to Life" by the young artist Alexander Ivanovich Kidayev is also an oil painting with Soviet women as its theme. He depicts a group of female students who have just graduated from middle school. After saying goodbye to their teachers, they happily walk out of the school gate with their graduation certificates in their hands, heading towards a new life. A wide road lies in front of them. They can choose their favorite major, and they can go to any university to continue their studies. The thriving summer nature depicted in the background of the picture – the lush green trees and flowers – is extremely harmonious with the images of the smiling young girls in gorgeous clothes who are in their youth. The entire picture is full of moist air and brilliant sunshine, full of the growth of life and pleasant emotions. It is a vibrant song of youth. The women here are new people who have grown up on socialist soil and have been cultivated with communist education. They are energetic young people who are full of confidence in their own strength. They are a new generation with new emotional qualities and full of ideals. They are the masters of life and the builders of the future communist society. When we look at their images, we are infected by their vigorous and healthy spirit, and we are encouraged by their youthful vigor. The reason why this painting is so touching is because the painter has captured the real and moving life atmosphere in reality, as well as the vivid and beautiful images of the female students.

In terms of depicting the excellent spiritual qualities of children, Nikolai Nikolayevich Zhukov's oil painting "Little Pavlik Morozov" is a work that impresses us deeply. This is a theme of real tragic conflict that the artist has drawn from life. The protagonist of the work, Little Pavlik Morozov, showed his incomparably strong character in the struggle against the rich peasants during the period of agricultural collectivization. He was later brutally murdered by enemies who opposed the Soviet system. The little hero in the painting is wearing a red scarf and bravely stands in front of the enemies to argue with them. His righteous and fearless fighting posture to defend the interests of the people makes the enemies appear speechless and reasonable in front of him, making them appear sinister and small, showing a panicked look. However, Little Pavlik stands there like a giant, motionless. His heroic qualities are a role model for our Chinese children.

The socialist spirit contained in the above works has played a good educational role for the Soviet people. The Soviet people have drawn strength and confidence from these works to fight for peace and for the victory of communism. These works are now being exhibited in Beijing, and undoubtedly they also have great educational significance for the Chinese people. Through these works, we can see that Soviet painters, when expressing the noble qualities of the Soviet people, not only adopt the method of focusing on depicting the faces and spiritual states of the subjects (such as "The Morning of Our Motherland," etc.), but also adopt the method of expressing heroic images through historical facts and combat life (such as "Tanya," "Little Pavlik Morozov," etc.); not only expressing the noble qualities of the people in the struggle against the enemy, but also using contradictions and conflicts in the internal life of the people to criticize the bad ideas and bad habits left over from the old society (such as Levitan and Turin's "The Newly Published Workshop Wall Newspaper," etc.), thereby building the new spiritual qualities and new moral habits of the Soviet people. In this way, Soviet painters, according to the complexity of life itself, use diverse methods to engage in the sacred cause of being "engineers of the human soul," which makes Soviet painting appear very rich. And only in this way can it reflect the real life of the Soviet Union in many ways. Therefore, these works are excellent teaching materials for our Chinese painters.

Ilya Ehrenburg once said: "One must first have great emotions in order to describe great emotions" (see "The Writer and Life"). Therefore, when our Chinese painters learn from the Soviet works that depict great emotions and noble spiritual qualities, they should also not forget how to improve their own spiritual qualities.

    高尚的精神品质——谈苏联展览会中的几幅绘画作品
    力群
    苏联的绘画，继承了十九世纪巡回展览画派绘画的现实主义的优良传统，在苏联共产党的英明领导下，在以社会主义现实主义的方法表现苏联人的高尚的精神品质这一重大主题方面，已经获得了光辉的成就。
    数十年来，苏联共产党在苏联人民的身上培养了新的思想感情，提高了他们的爱国主义精神，教育他们以共产主义的态度去对待周围的事物，这样就在苏联人民当中成长了新的人类的美好的情感和品质，产生了社会主义的劳动观点，以及人和人之间的新的关系……。所有这些，就是苏联画家表现苏联人民的高尚精神品质的社会根据。
    目前正在北京举行的“苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会”上展出的绘画作品，虽然只是苏联优秀美术作品的一小部分，然而我们从这些作品中也就可以看出苏联画家们在这方面的努力和成就。
    苏联画家不仅在绘画中创造了列宁、斯大林的伟大形象，以此去教育人民，而且也善于发掘和表现普通人的高尚精神品质，以及他们的典型的和正面的特质，创造值得做别人的模范和效仿对象的明朗的艺术形象。
    在表现领袖的崇高精神品质的作品中，费·萨·苏尔宾的曾经荣获一九四八年斯大林奖金的油画“我们祖国的早晨”，给我以极其深刻的印象。苏尔宾画的是斯大林的半身像，由于画出了斯大林的真实的面貌和伟大的思想感情，画出了对于表现主题思想有极其重要意义的环境背景，因而使这一作品具有深刻而丰富的思想内容。
    画家在这里所画的领袖形象，不是仅仅做到了表面的肖似，而是刻划了斯大林的面貌特征，并画出了他的精神本质。这是一位具有远大眼光和广宽胸襟的巨人的形象，是一位具有丰富思想和伟大的精神气魄的、敢于推翻旧世界的革命导师的形象，是一位坚强而沉着的全心全意为人民的幸福而献身的工人阶级领袖的形象。面对着这个形象，使我们体会到斯大林的崇高的精神品质，使我们感到，这正是我们心目中的斯大林。
      “我们祖国的早晨”是一幅画面极其明朗的油画，表现斯大林在一个清新的春天的早晨，穿着白色的上衣，手臂上挂着外套站在苏联集体化和电气化了的一望无际的田野上，他的严肃的面部和雄伟的身材为早晨的金色的阳光所照耀，他以英明而智慧的眼光展望着前方。“我们祖国的早晨”象征着苏维埃国家正在日益繁荣富强；画面背景辽阔广大的原野，以及斯大林的宽阔的胸怀和他展望前景的神态，就好似在苏联人民的面前所展现的共产主义的前景。
    在展出的作品中，有不少作品成功地表现了苏联红军的高贵品质。例如彼·亚·克里沃诺果夫画的“布列斯特要塞的保卫者”。这幅画描绘了一九四一年六月二十二日法西斯匪徒开始疯狂进攻布列斯特时遭到苏联红军迎头痛击的情景。为了描绘得符合于历史的真实性，画家曾仔细研究了所有的布列斯特要塞防卫者的材料，并曾亲自去过当时的战斗地点，在那里画了很多草图。画家通过那些倒塌了的楼房和充满弹痕的墙壁，以及和敌人的尸体混杂在一起的碎砖破瓦，表现了这场战斗的激烈性和红军在这里坚守阵地的顽强性；通过那些负了伤还继续战斗的英雄形象、对敌人无比的仇恨心情和英勇姿态，表现了红军战士们的钢铁般的意志和高度的爱国主义精神，表现了他们自我牺牲的勇敢精神和在敌人面前所显示出来的优秀的道德品质。
    乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国功勋艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者，维·格·普兹里科夫画的“黑海水兵”，也是一幅富有爱国主义精神的革命历史题材的油画。他描绘苏联水兵在进入了解放英雄城塞瓦斯托波尔的战斗中，他们从小艇上跳下海水，手拿冲锋枪冲上海岸的情景。画面背景的阴云密布的天空、冲激着海岸的巨浪，更加助长了画面的战斗气氛。画家表现了苏联水兵的无限勇敢和不屈不挠的精神。
    苏联人民美术家、苏联美术学院院长、斯大林奖金数次获得者亚·米·格拉西莫夫的“画家群像”，是一幅杰出的肖像画。在这幅画上，依·尼·巴甫洛夫、华·尼·巴克什也夫、维·卡·比雅雷尼茨基——比卢略和华·尼·麦什科夫等四位苏维埃前辈老画家的容貌、风度，被画得异常生动、逼真。他们那朴实、和蔼、乐观主义的精神和健壮的体态，具有俄罗斯人民的气质和特征，也显示了艺术大师们的意志和毅力。格拉西莫夫自己也是苏维埃前辈画家，唯其如此，他在这幅画上才出色地刻划了四位老画家高尚的精神面貌。
    在表现苏维埃妇女的高尚的精神品质方面，给我以深刻印象的是库克雷尼克塞集体创作的“丹娘”。丹娘是全世界人民所敬仰的反法西斯的女英雄，每个观众都熟悉她的身世。画家们在这幅画中，通过丹娘临刑前站在绞刑台上挺直胸膛紧握拳头的英雄形象，表现了丹娘为了人民的利益，为了人类的正义，为了祖国的尊严，而临难不惧视死如归的伟大精神。与此同时，画家也如实地表现了德国法西斯匪徒们在丹娘的英勇不屈的巨像面前，所显示的卑鄙的恐惧心理，从而形成了正义同非正义的、光明同黑暗的显明对照。那灰色的天空和地面的白雪以及矗立在画面中心的绞刑架，更加造成了整个画面的凄凉而阴沉的情调。画家为了创作这个作品，曾到丹娘牺牲的地点——彼得里西伏村进行了调查研究，使描绘的情节和环境背景都符合当时的真实情况。现在，丹娘的名字对于一切进步人类已经成为革命英雄主义的象征，画家在这幅画中所创造的丹娘的形象，是完全能够体现她的伟大的精神品质的，她是我们每一个革命战士的榜样。
    在表现苏联妇女美好的情感和品质的作品中，波·米·聂门斯基于一九五二年创作的“我们的姊妹们”也给我很深的印象。聂门斯基是莫斯科格列科夫画室的军事画家、斯大林奖金获得者，他在苏联卫国战争中有丰富的战地生活。在这幅画里，描绘了在战地临时伤兵医院中工作的两个女护士，在她们工作室的邻室有很多睡在床上的光荣负伤的红军，此时刚刚黎明，桌上还点着通夜未熄的灯，一个值夜班的女护士穿着白色的工作服坐在灯下卷绷带，在她对面坐着一个不穿工服的大概是已经值过夜班的女护士，她靠在墙上打盹，在她的旁边放着冲锋枪，还放着到战地救护用的医药袋，整个室内显得极其寂静，我们似乎可以听到隔室伤员们的呻吟和打鼾声，以及远处传来的战场上的枪炮声。画家歌颂了卫国战争中为祖国辛勤服务的苏联妇女。我虽然缺乏战地生活，然而这幅画仍然能引起我很多的联想。从画面情节可以使我们理解他们在自己的工作岗位上是如何的辛苦，如何的负责。画家所描绘的那个靠在墙上打盹的护士，使我们感到她工作的艰苦，而那个正抬起头来看着窗外的护士，也使我们感到她对于战地的关怀。她看着从窗外射进来的黎明的晓光，就像看到了胜利的曙光一样。我们看着这样的图画，总要被这两位女护士的崇高的精神所感动。而这也正是社会主义现实主义绘画的力量所在。
    维·叶·齐卡尔的炭画“小牛生下来了”，所描绘的是苏维埃集体农庄中一个极其平凡的生活场面，然而也是富有诗意的场面，在这幅画中所表现的一切都充满了感情，所有的生命都使我们感到心爱。一个女兽医在母牛的生产中进行了助产工作，现在小牛顺利地生下来了，她一面擦手，一面看着这一对生物的动静，显示了她内心无尽的喜悦，以及对于这两个牛的极其怜爱的心情。在她的后面站着另一个妇女，她是集体农庄的饲养员，她在为集体农庄增加了新的财富而高兴。这两个妇女的工作在苏维埃国家里都是极其平凡的工作，而她们本身也是最普通的苏联人民，然而就在这些普通的妇女身上，通过齐卡尔的描绘，却使我们看出了她们对于苏维埃国家的社会主义公共财物所表现的无微不至的爱护。这种美好的感情和品质，是社会主义制度的巩固和发展的可靠保证。
    青年艺术家阿·依·基达也夫画的极其明朗的作品“我们走向生活”，也是一幅以苏联妇女为题材的油画。他画出了一群刚从中学校里毕业的女学生，她们和老师告别后，手里拿着毕业证书愉快地走出校门，走向新的生活。在她们面前摆着一条宽广的大道，她们可以选择自己所喜爱的专业，她们可以到任何大学里去继续学习。画面背景上所描绘的夏日的欣欣向荣的大自然——那葱郁的嫩绿色的树丛和花木，和处在青春时代的穿着华丽衣服的笑容满面的少女们的形象极其协调。整个画面充满了润泽的空气和灿烂的阳光，充满了生命的成长和愉快的情调，它是一首朝气蓬勃的青春之歌。这里的妇女是在社会主义的土壤上成长起来、用共产主义教育培养出来的新人，她们是生气勃勃地对自己的力量充满了信心的青年，是具有新的情感品质的充满了理想的新生一代，她们是生活的主人，是未来的共产主义社会的建设者。我们看着她们的形象就为她们的富有生命力的健康的精神所感染，就为她们的青春的朝气所鼓舞。这幅画之所以如此感人，就因为画家画出了现实中的真实而动人的生活气氛，和活生生的美好的女学生形象。
    在描绘儿童的优良精神品质方面，尼·尼·柴巴科夫的油画“小巴维尔·莫罗佐夫”是给我们以深刻印象的作品，这是艺术家从生活中吸取来的真正悲剧性冲突的题材。作品的主人公小巴维尔·莫罗佐夫在农业集体化时期，在同富农进行斗争中，表现了他的无比坚强的性格，他是后来被反对苏维埃制度的敌人残杀了的。画中的小英雄戴着红领巾，勇敢地站在敌人的面前同他们争辩，他那正义的为保卫人民利益而毫无畏惧的战斗姿态，使敌人在他面前显得词穷理屈，显得阴险渺小，显出了张皇失措的样子。然而小巴维尔却站在那里像一个巨人似的不动，他的英雄的品质是我们中国儿童的榜样。
    以上这些作品所包含的社会主义精神，对于苏联人民曾起了良好的教育作用，苏联人民从这些作品中吸取着为和平、为共产主义的胜利而斗争的力量和信心。这些作品现在在北京展出，无疑的对于中国人民也有很大的教育意义。通过这些作品我们可以看出苏联画家在表现苏联人的高尚品质时，不仅采用了集中描绘对象的面貌和精神状态的方法（如“我们祖国的早晨”等），而且也采取了通过历史事实和战斗生活来表现英雄形象的方法（如“丹娘”、“小巴维尔·莫罗佐夫”等）；不仅在对敌斗争中表现人民的高尚品质，而且也通过人民内部生活中的矛盾和冲突，去抨击从旧社会遗留下来的不良思想和恶习（如列维亭和屠林合作的“刚出版的车间墙报”等），从而去建设苏维埃人的新的精神品质和新的道德习惯。这样，苏联画家根据生活本身的复杂性而用了多样的方法来从事“人类灵魂工程师”的神圣事业，就使得苏维埃的绘画表现得非常丰富。而且也只有这样才能够多方面地反映苏联的现实生活。因此，这些作品对于我们中国的画家就是极好的教材。
    爱伦堡曾说：“必须先有伟大的情感，才能描写伟大的情感”（见“作家与生活”）。因此，当我们中国的画家向苏联的描绘伟大情感和高尚精神品质的作品学习时，也不应该忘记如何提高自己的精神品质。
