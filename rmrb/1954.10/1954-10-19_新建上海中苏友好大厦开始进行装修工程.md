The Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, symbolizing the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, is progressing rapidly. On October 15th, an octagonal golden steel tower, rising more than 100 meters above the ground, was erected in the central hall. The giant red five-pointed star at the top of the steel tower soars into the air, radiating light and visible from all directions in Shanghai.

Since construction began on May 4th, this grand building, under the guidance of renowned Soviet architects and engineers, has seen Chinese construction workers display great enthusiasm and overcome the difficulties of construction during the rainy season. By September 4th, the structural engineering of the central hall, the industrial pavilion, the agricultural pavilion, and the cultural pavilion was basically completed. The structure of the cinema was completed in early October. It has now entered the complex and arduous stage of interior and exterior decoration.

The construction of the building has received the care and support of the broad masses of people in Shanghai. Workers at the Shanghai Hardware Company, the Shanghai Building Materials Company, the state-owned East China Machine Tool Plant, and many other factories have actively processed materials for the construction of the building. Since the start of construction on May 4th, more than 6,000 outstanding young people from all walks of life in Shanghai have voluntarily signed up to participate in voluntary labor. Workers at the Shanghai Transportation Company put forward the slogan "On call at any time" and transported large quantities of various building materials day and night.

The release of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué has even more powerfully inspired the enthusiasm of the workers on the construction site. On the afternoon of the 12th, the workers on the site held a forum, and they expressed their determination to strive to complete the construction of the building ahead of schedule, in order to thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their profound friendship towards us.

    新建上海中苏友好大厦开始进行装修工程
    象征着中苏两国人民深厚友谊的上海中苏友好大厦工程进展很快。十月十五日在中央大厅上已升起离地面高达一百多公尺的八角形金色钢塔，钢塔顶端的巨型红色五角星高耸在空中，光芒四射，从上海的四面八方都可看到。
    这座规模宏大的建筑从五月四日开工后，在著名的苏联建筑师、工程师的指导下，我国的建筑工人们发挥了高度的劳动热情，克服了雨季施工的困难，到九月四日就基本上完成了中央大厅、工业馆、农业馆、文化馆的结构工程，十月初又完成了电影馆的结构工程：目前已进入复杂艰巨的内外装修工程阶段。
    大厦工程在进行中得到了上海广大人民的关怀和支持。上海五金公司、上海建筑材料公司、国营华东机具修造厂等很多工厂的工人们，都积极为建设大厦的工程加工。从五月四日开工的那天起，就有六千多名上海各界优秀青年先后自动报名参加义务劳动。上海市运输公司的工人们在工作中提出“随叫随到”的口号，夜以继日地输送了大量的各种建筑材料。
    中苏会谈公报公布，更有力地鼓舞了工地工人的劳动热情。十二日下午工地上的工人们举行了一次座谈会，他们纷纷表示要争取提前完成大厦建筑工程，以答谢苏联政府和苏联人民对我们的深厚友谊。（本报上海记者站）
