Dear Comrades,

On the occasion of this glorious festival—the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me, on behalf of the Mongolian people, its government, and the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, to extend to you, and through you to the fraternal and great Chinese people, warm and heartfelt respect and congratulations.

Today, hundreds of millions of Chinese people and all progressive humanity are celebrating the important anniversary of the Chinese people's historic victory. This victory is the great achievement of the Chinese people's long and heroic struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by their tested leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the heroic Chinese people, after a tenacious and selfless struggle, cleared the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary traitorous clique and foreign imperialists from the country, and finally won freedom and independence, establishing the great People's Republic of China.

In the five years of the free existence of a strong People's Democratic China, the Chinese people have achieved many truly great achievements in all aspects of the national economy and culture, and in the cause of consolidating the people's democratic state, realizing huge social, economic and cultural reforms within the country.

The recently concluded session of the National People's Congress summarized these great victories and adopted China's first democratic constitution in history, a document that uses legislative procedures to consolidate the historical victories already achieved by the People's Republic of China.

For hundreds of years, the Mongolian and Chinese peoples were under the cruel oppression of feudal nobles and landlords and suffered the inhuman exploitation of the imperialists.

The Mongolian people, liberated from social and national oppression with the fraternal and great help of the great Soviet people, have always held sincere sympathy for the Chinese people's heroic struggle for freedom and a happy life. The heroic struggle of our great neighbor, the Chinese people, has always been a valuable help to the Mongolian people in their struggle against imperialist robbers and in defending and consolidating their freedom and independence.

The Mongolian people greeted the establishment of the strong People's Republic of China with extreme joy. The establishment of the People's Republic of China is a historic victory for the Chinese people and the entire democratic camp. This is a very important factor that makes the external environment of the Mongolian People's Republic more solid.

Our people watch with great admiration the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese people in building a new People's China, and happily regard every success of the Chinese people as their own success.

The most sincere fraternal friendship exists and develops between our two peoples. Economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries is developing and consolidating year by year. Our people are proud of their friendship with the great peace-loving neighbor, the Chinese people.

The increasingly consolidated fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples will continue to consolidate and develop for the prosperity and happiness of our two peoples. This friendship serves the sacred cause of maintaining and consolidating world peace.

The Mongolian people, who were once under the heavy oppression of feudal nobles and foreign enslavers, have achieved great achievements in national economic and cultural construction with the fraternal and comprehensive assistance of their liberator and great friend, the Soviet people, and are smoothly transitioning from feudalism to socialism.

At present, relying on the constant selfless help of the Soviet Union, and vigorously consolidating friendship and cooperation with various people's democratic countries, our people are implementing their second five-year plan.

The Mongolian people believe that doing everything possible to consolidate the fraternal friendship with their great neighbors, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and with various people's democratic countries, is a solid foundation for a free and happy life and a guarantee for the smooth development of their country towards the road of socialism.

The Mongolian people happily celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China as they celebrate their own holiday, and sincerely wish the great Chinese people further brilliant victories in the great struggle to build a socialist new society, and in the struggle to defend the peace and security of all peoples.

Let the fraternal and unbreakable friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples be further consolidated and developed!

Long live the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by our common friend, the great Soviet Union!

    蒙古人民共和国政府代表团团长
    桑布的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    值此光荣的节日——中华人民共和国成立五周年之际，请允许我代表蒙古人民及其政府和蒙古人民革命党中央委员会向你们，并通过你们向兄弟般的伟大的中国人民致热烈的、衷心的敬意和祝贺。
    今天，数亿中国人民和全体进步人类都在庆祝中国人民获得历史性胜利的重要纪念日。这一胜利正是中国人民为了祖国的自由和独立而进行的长期英勇斗争的伟大成果。
    英勇的中国人民在以久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导之下，进行了顽强的、奋不顾身的斗争，从国内清除了蒋介石反动卖国集团和外国帝国主义者，终于获得了自由和独立，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国。
    在强大的人民民主中国自由地存在的五年中，中国人民在国民经济和文化的各方面，在巩固人民民主国家的事业中，都获得了许多真正伟大的成就，在国内实现了巨大的社会经济和文化的改革。
    刚刚闭幕的全国人民代表大会会议总结了这些伟大的胜利，通过了中国有史以来第一部民主的宪法，这一文件是用立法的程序来巩固中华人民共和国已经获得的历史性的胜利。
    几百年来，蒙古人民和中国人民都曾处在封建贵族和地主的残酷压迫下，遭受过帝国主义者惨无人道的剥削。
    在伟大的苏联人民兄弟般的伟大的帮助下从社会的和民族的压迫下解放出来的蒙古人民，对于中国人民为争取自由和幸福的生活而进行的英勇斗争，始终怀抱着真挚的同情。我们伟大的邻邦——中国人民的英勇斗争，对于在反对帝国主义强盗、保卫和巩固自由和独立的斗争中的蒙古人民，一向都是宝贵的帮助。
    蒙古人民以极其愉快的心情迎接了强大的中华人民共和国的成立。中华人民共和国的成立是中国人民和整个民主阵营具有历史意义的胜利。这是一个非常重要的因素，它使得蒙古人民共和国的外部环境更加巩固。
    我国人民以万分钦佩的心情注视着中国人民在建设人民新中国的事业中所取得的卓越成就，并快慰地把中国人民的每一成功，都看做是自己的成功。
    在我们两国人民之间存在着并发展着最真诚的兄弟般的友谊。我们两国之间的经济与文化合作正在一年一年地发展并巩固起来。我国人民都以他们与爱好和平的伟大邻邦——中国人民之间的友谊而自豪。
    蒙古人民和中国人民之间日益巩固的兄弟般的友谊，将为了我们两国人民的繁荣与幸福而继续巩固和发展，这种友谊是服务于维护和巩固世界和平的神圣事业的。
    过去曾处于封建贵族和外国奴役者沉重压迫下的蒙古人民，在自己的解放者和伟大的朋友——苏联人民兄弟般的全面帮助下，已在国家经济和文化建设中取得了巨大的成就，并顺利地由封建主义走向社会主义。
    目前，我国人民依靠着苏联的经常的无私的帮助，并大力巩固与各人民民主国家的友谊和合作，正在执行着自己的第二个五年计划。
    蒙古人民认为尽一切力量巩固与自己的伟大邻邦——苏联和中华人民共和国以及与各人民民主国家的兄弟般的友谊，是自由和幸福生活的稳固基础，是自己国家向社会主义道路顺利发展的保证。
    蒙古人民像庆祝自己的节日一样，愉快地庆祝中华人民共和国成立五周年纪念，并衷心愿望伟大的中国人民，在建设社会主义的新社会的伟大斗争中，在保卫各族人民的和平和安全的斗争中，获得进一步的辉煌胜利。
    让蒙古人民与中国人民之间兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊更加巩固和发展吧！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    以我们共同的朋友——伟大的苏联为首的强大的和平民主社会主义阵营万岁！
