Comrade Ambassador, comrades, friends:

    Today, as we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the "Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction," which we have long awaited and which demonstrates the great power of peace, opens in our capital. The Chinese people are extremely excited and honored by the opening of the Soviet Exhibition. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to the Soviet Government for holding this grand exhibition, to the Soviet experts and all working comrades who have worked selflessly in preparing it, and to the Soviet National Folk Dance Troupe led by Comrade Igor Moiseyev and the Opera Troupe of the National Moscow Musical Theater named after Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko for coming to our country to perform in coordination.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people achieved the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution and established the first socialist country in the world. Now they are confidently marching towards the highest ideal of mankind – a communist society. This Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction demonstrates the glorious achievements of Soviet socialist and communist construction. In this magnificent and beautiful exhibition hall, more than 11,000 precious exhibits transported from all over the Soviet Union are on display. Here, we can see the world's rare industrial and agricultural products and great construction projects, the world's most sophisticated science and technology and very excellent artistic creations, as well as the Soviet people's high level of culture and happy life.

    Since the great October Socialist Revolution, the victories of the Soviet people have continuously inspired the struggle of the Chinese people. Now the Chinese people are advancing along the glorious road taken by the Soviet people towards a prosperous and happy socialist society. The Chinese people have received great, generous, and comprehensive assistance from the Soviet government and the Soviet people in their work. The Chinese people will never forget this invaluable friendship from the Soviet Union and will follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong to continuously strengthen the sincere cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, strive to learn from the Soviet Union, and build our country into an industrialized socialist country with a high degree of modern culture.

    At a time when our people are beginning socialist construction and socialist transformation, the exhibition of achievements in Soviet economic and cultural construction has special significance. The Soviet exhibition not only concretely demonstrates the Soviet people's care and friendship for the Chinese people once again, but also provides the most vivid and intimate example for our country's construction cause. Our people will learn from the rich construction experience of the Soviet Union through the exhibition, learn from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, learn from the excellent culture and art of the Soviet Union, learn from the spirit of hard struggle and selfless labor of the Soviet people, and work harder to complete our great historical task. Therefore, the exhibition of the Soviet exhibition is a major contribution both in strengthening the close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and in promoting China's socialist construction cause.

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!
    Long live the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the strong fortress of world peace!

    我对外贸易部部长叶季壮的讲话亲爱的大使同志，同志们、朋友们：
    今天，正当我们庆祝中华人民共和国建国五周年的时候，我们盼望已久的、显示着伟大和平力量的“苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会”在我国首都开幕了。中国人民对苏联展览会的开幕感到极大的兴奋和荣幸。我代表中华人民共和国政府，对于苏联政府举办这个盛大的展览会、筹备的苏联专家和全体工作同志的忘我劳动，对于由依戈尔·莫伊塞耶夫同志率领的苏联国立民间舞蹈团和以史坦尼斯拉夫斯基和涅米罗维奇—坦钦柯命名的国立莫斯科音乐剧院歌剧团来我国配合演出，表示热烈的欢迎和深切的感谢。
    苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，取得了十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，在世界上建立了第一个社会主义国家，现在正满怀信心地向着人类最崇高的理想——共产主义社会迈进。这次举办的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会显示了苏联社会主义和共产主义建设的辉煌成就。在这所宏伟的美丽的展览馆里，陈列着从苏联各地运来的一万一千多件珍贵的展品，在这里，我们可以看到世界上罕有的工农业产品和伟大的建设工程，可以看到世界上最精深的科学技术和非常优秀的艺术创作，也可以看到苏联人民高度的文化水平和美满幸福的生活。
    从伟大的十月社会主义革命以来，苏联人民的胜利就不断地鼓舞着中国人民的斗争。现在中国人民正沿着苏联人民走过的光荣道路向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会前进。中国人民在自己的工作中得到苏联政府和苏联人民伟大的、慷慨的、全面的援助。中国人民永远不会忘记苏联这种无上珍贵的友谊，并将遵照毛泽东同志的指示，不断加强中苏两国的真诚合作，努力向苏联学习，把我国建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的社会主义国家。
    正当我国人民开始社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时候，苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的展出具有特殊的意义。苏联展览会不但又一次具体地表现了苏联人民对中国人民的关怀和友好，而且为我国的建设事业提供了最生动、最亲切的榜样。我国人民将通过展览会学习苏联丰富的建设经验，学习苏联先进的科学技术，学习苏联优秀的文化艺术，学习苏联人民艰苦奋斗和忘我劳动的精神，加紧努力来完成我们伟大的历史任务。因此，苏联展览会的展出，无论在加强中苏两国人民的亲密友谊方面或者在促进中国的社会主义建设事业方面，都是一个重大的贡献。
    中苏两国人民永久的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    世界和平的坚强堡垒——伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
