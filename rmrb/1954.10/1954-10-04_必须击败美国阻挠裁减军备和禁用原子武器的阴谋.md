    The head of the Soviet delegation to the Ninth UN General Assembly, Vyshinsky, put forward a proposal at the plenary session of the UN General Assembly on September 30 regarding the conclusion of an international convention on disarmament, prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. This proposal has aroused widespread attention among the public in various countries.
    In recent years, the Soviet government has made unremitting efforts to achieve the lofty goal of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The recently published documents on the Soviet-American atomic energy negotiation process powerfully demonstrate the Soviet Union's sincere efforts to resolve the atomic energy issue despite all difficulties. Although the Soviet-American atomic energy negotiations did not yield results due to the obstruction of the U.S. government, the Soviet government continues to seek ways to reach international agreements. The new proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly once again embodies the Soviet government's consistent position and proposition. This is to guarantee disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and to establish an effective international supervision system.
    However, the experience of the Soviet-American atomic energy negotiations proves that international agreements on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons can only be reached by defeating the U.S. conspiracy to obstruct the prohibition of atomic weapons.
    The U.S. ruling clique has tried its best to distort the truth and put the responsibility for the fruitless Soviet-American atomic energy negotiations on the Soviet Union. However, the documents of the Soviet-American atomic energy negotiations clearly prove that it was not the Soviet Union, but the United States, that obstructed the conclusion of an agreement in the Soviet-American atomic energy negotiations.
    The nature and intention of the "Atoms for Peace" proposal put forward by U.S. President Eisenhower on December 8, 1953, were clear at a glance. This proposal advocated that relevant countries hand over only a small portion of atomic raw materials to the "International Atomic Energy Agency" under the auspices of the United Nations for peaceful purposes, while avoiding the fundamental issue of stopping the ever-expanding production of atomic weapons and prohibiting the use of atomic weapons. Therefore, Eisenhower's proposal not only could not guarantee that atomic energy would only be used for peaceful purposes and not for military purposes, but in fact, it would instead give international permission for the production of atomic weapons and the arms race, and relax the vigilance of the people of all countries against the atomic war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. The proposal can only be regarded as the U.S. atomic warmongers' increasingly unfavorable situation after losing the monopoly of atomic weapons and the so-called "atomic military superiority," and their eagerness to cover up their policy of stepping up the atomic arms race with a disguise of peace, and to shift world public opinion's dissatisfaction with their policy. The process of the Soviet-American atomic energy negotiations fully proves this fact.
    Although the Soviet government pointed out at the time that the U.S. "Atoms for Peace" proposal did nothing to help stop the expansion of atomic weapons production and eliminate the threat of atomic war, it still expressed its willingness to participate in negotiations and made new efforts to open up a path. From the very beginning, the Soviet government stated, and insisted during the consultations, that the Soviet proposal should be discussed at the same time, namely, that all countries participating in the agreement, in the spirit of easing international tensions, would undertake the sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. The Soviet government pointed out that if an international agreement could be reached on this issue, it would be possible to gradually eliminate all atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other types of weapons of mass destruction from the military equipment of all countries, and establish strict international supervision to ensure the implementation of the agreement on prohibiting the use of atomic energy for war.
    At the same time, the Soviet government advocated that all countries, especially the five countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the People's Republic of China, should participate in the negotiations on the atomic energy issue and participate in the declaration of undertaking the unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.
  All peace-loving people can see from the above-mentioned proposals of the Soviet government the Soviet government's sincere attitude of consultation and its consistent position of striving to eliminate the threat of atomic war.
    It is very clear that in order to eliminate the threat of atomic war and ensure that atomic energy is used only for peaceful purposes, the major countries must undertake the obligation to guarantee that they will not use atomic weapons; it is not enough to use only a small portion of atomic raw materials for peaceful purposes, but all atomic raw materials should be used for peaceful purposes; the international organizations established by various countries for this purpose should not only manage and supervise the "pooling" of a small portion of atomic raw materials, but should ensure the implementation of the agreement prohibiting the use of atomic weapons.
    However, during the negotiations, the U.S. government always resisted this reasonable proposal of the Soviet Union. U.S. government documents show that it still adheres to its past stubborn position, unwilling to prohibit the use of atomic weapons, unwilling to undertake such international obligations; moreover, even in the international organization it proposes, it even attempts to put itself in a privileged position in order to impose its will on other countries. This attitude of the U.S. government is very absurd. If the U.S. government is really willing to promote the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, why is it unwilling to use all atomic raw materials for peaceful purposes, and why is it unwilling to undertake the international obligation to prohibit the use of atomic weapons? The U.S. government's excuse for opposing the Soviet proposal is that it cannot believe that the agreement of all countries unconditionally refusing to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons can be fulfilled; but according to this, what international treaties and agreements will be respected? If so, wouldn't even the international atomic pooling plan proposed by the U.S. government become superfluous? The fact is that an international agreement prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, if reached, would tie the hands and feet of the U.S. war-mongering clique, and would reduce the profits of several U.S. atomic energy monopoly capitalists, and therefore the U.S. government serving these monopoly capitalists is trying its best to obstruct the signing of such an international agreement.
    People have seen that the Soviet government is now not only working hard on the defense against atomic weapons attacks, but also sparing no effort to open up broad prospects for the peaceful construction of atomic energy. The Soviet government announced on June 27 this year that it had completed the construction of the first atomic energy power station and started generating electricity. The Soviet Union's outstanding achievements in the development of atomic energy have greatly strengthened the Soviet Union's strength in defending world peace and inspired the confidence of the people of all countries in the struggle to safeguard peace. However, people have also seen that the U.S. ruling clique, under the guise of "peace," is stepping up its atomic arms race and atomic war preparations, and is endlessly carrying out atomic blackmail and intimidation. The total amount of investment in the U.S. atomic industry will increase from 8.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1953 to 10 billion U.S. dollars at the end of the current fiscal year. The industry that manufactures atomic weapons has become one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy and is a major source of maximum profits for the U.S. monopoly capital group. The statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on March 20 this year also made no secret of the fact that the United States is keen on using atomic weapons "for strategic purposes and tactical purposes." Recently, just as the U.S. representatives were talking lavishly about the "huge possibilities of exploring and developing atomic energy for peaceful purposes" at the UN General Assembly, General Gruenther, the supreme commander of the U.S. stationed in the North Atlantic Military Alliance, frankly stated that he opposed the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and opposed undertaking such obligations. These facts show that the U.S.'s consistent rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal to prohibit the use of atomic weapons is by no means accidental.
    From the very beginning, the U.S. government categorically rejected the Soviet Union's proposal that the People's Republic of China should participate in the atomic issue negotiations and conclude an international convention prohibiting the use of atomic weapons. This further exposed the U.S.'s hostility towards the People's Republic of China and its unwillingness to truly reach an international agreement prohibiting the use of atomic weapons. It is a well-known fact that the U.S. aggressor group carried out particularly blatant atomic war hysteria aimed at the People's Republic of China during the atomic energy negotiations.
    Now, people's attention is focused on the UN General Assembly. The General Committee of the UN General Assembly has included the U.S. proposal on the "Atoms for Peace" plan in the agenda of the General Assembly. But as mentioned above, this proposal does nothing to stop the expansion of atomic weapons production and eliminate the threat of atomic war. If this UN General Assembly is not to allow the United States to achieve its goal of deceiving world public opinion, creating new obstacles to the peaceful cause of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons and disarmament, and benefiting the conspirators, and once again damaging the prestige of the United Nations; then, it should conduct discussions based on the Soviet proposal and make decisions that are sufficient to reassure people.
    The warm sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries and people in the world for the Soviet government's proposals to prohibit atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and to reduce armaments, are absolutely not to be ignored. The government and people of the People's Republic of China fully support the new proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation, and believe that the universal desire of the people of all countries to prohibit these weapons and reduce armaments must be satisfied, and the U.S.'s policy of continuing to promote atomic war preparations and expand armaments must be defeated.

### 必须击败美国阻挠裁减军备和禁用原子武器的阴谋

    必须击败美国阻挠裁减军备和禁用原子武器的阴谋
    出席第九届联合国大会的苏联代表团团长维辛斯基，九月三十日在联合国大会全体会议上提出了关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约的提案。这个提案在各国公众中引起了普遍的重视。
    近年来苏联政府为了达到裁减军备和禁用原子武器这个崇高目的进行了不懈的努力。最近公布的关于苏美两国原子能谈判过程的各项文件，非常有力地证明了苏联不顾一切困难，争取解决原子能问题的真诚努力。苏美原子能谈判，虽因美国政府的阻挠，未获结果；但苏联政府仍然继续寻求达成国际协议的途径。苏联代表团这次向联大提出的新提案，再一次体现了苏联政府的一贯立场和主张。这就是保证裁减军备和禁用原子武器，并建立有效的国际监督制度。
    但是，苏美原子能谈判的经验证明了，必须击败美国阻挠禁用原子武器的阴谋，才能使裁减军备和禁用原子武器问题达成国际的协议。
    美国统治集团曾竭力歪曲事实真相、把苏美原子能谈判毫无结果的责任推在苏联身上，但苏美原子能谈判的文件清楚地证明，阻挠苏美原子能谈判达成协议的不是苏联，而是美国。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在一九五三年十二月八日提出的“原子共储”建议的性质和意图，本来就是一目了然的。这个建议主张有关各国只拿出一小部分原子原料交给联合国主持的“国际原子能机构”以用于和平目的，对于制止原子武器的日益扩大的生产，和禁止使用原子武器的根本问题，则避而不谈。因此，艾森豪威尔的提议，不仅不能保证使原子能只用于和平用途而不用于军事用途，并且实际上是反而要使原子武器的生产和军备竞赛得到国际准许，使各国人民对于美帝国主义的原子战争的阴谋放松警惕。这个建议的提出，只能被认为是美国原子黩武主义者失掉了原子武器垄断权和所谓“原子军备优势”以后，处境日益不利，急于用和平的伪装，来遮盖它加紧实行原子军备竞赛的政策，转移世界舆论对它的政策的不满。苏美原子能谈判的过程，就充分地证明了这一事实。
    苏联政府当时虽然指出美国的“原子共储”建议对于停止扩充原子武器的生产和消除原子战争的威胁毫无帮助，但仍表示愿意参加谈判，并作了打开出路的新的努力。苏联政府一开始就表明，并在商谈过程中坚持应该同时讨论苏联的建议，即参与协议的各国，本着缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，将承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。苏联政府指出，在这个问题上如能取得国际协议，就将有可能逐步地从各国军备中取消全部原子武器、氢武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器，并建立严格的国际监督来保证关于禁用原子能来从事战争的协定的实施。
    同时，苏联政府主张，一切国家，特别是苏联、美国、英国、法国和中华人民共和国五个国家，都应参加原子能问题的谈判，并参加承担无条件地不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的义务的宣言。
  一切爱好和平的人，都能从苏联政府的上述建议中，看到苏联政府的真诚的协商态度，和它的争取消除原子战争威胁的一贯立场。
    很显然，为了消除原子战争的威胁，保证原子能只用于和平用途，那么，就必须由主要国家承担义务，保证不使用原子武器；就不能仅仅把一小部分原子原料用于和平用途，而应将全部原子原料用于和平用途；各国为此建立的国际机构，也不能只是管理和监督一小部分原子原料的“共储”，而应保证禁止使用原子武器的协议的贯彻实施。
    但是，在谈判过程中，美国政府对苏联的这个合理的建议始终是抗拒的。美国政府的文件表明，它依然坚持过去的顽固立场，不愿禁止使用原子武器，不愿承担这样的国际义务；而且，甚至在它所建议的国际机构中，也竟然企图把自己放在特权的地位上，以便把自己的意志强加于别国。美国政府的这种态度是十分荒谬的。美国政府如果真的愿意促进原子能用于和平目的，为什么不愿把全部原子原料都用于和平用途，为什么不愿承担禁止使用原子武器的国际义务呢？美国政府反对苏联建议的借口是，它不能相信各国无条件拒绝使用原子武器和氢武器的协议是能够兑现的；但是，照此说来，又还有什么国际条约和协定会受到尊重呢？如果这样，就连美国政府提出国际原子共储计划，不是也成了多余的吗？事实是，禁止使用原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性的武器的国际协议，如果达成的话，将会束缚美国好战集团的手脚，将会减少美国几个原子能垄断资本家的利润，因而为这些垄断资本家服务的美国政府才竭力阻挠签订这样的国际协议。
    人们都看到，苏联政府现在不仅努力于防御原子武器进攻的工作，而且正在不遗余力地开辟原子能用于和平建设的广阔前景。苏联政府宣布在今年六月二十七日完成了第一个原子能电力站的建设工作，并开始发电。苏联发展原子能的卓越成就，大大加强了苏联保卫世界和平的力量，鼓舞了各国人民维护和平斗争的信心。但是，人们却也看到了，美国统治集团正在“和平”的伪装下，加紧从事原子军备竞赛和原子战争准备，无休止地进行原子讹诈和恫吓。美国原子工业中的投资总数将从一九五三年的八十三亿美元增加到现行财政年度结束时的一百亿美元。制造原子武器的工业已成为美国经济中最巨大的部门之一，并且是美国垄断资本集团最大利润的主要来源之一。美国国务卿杜勒斯在今年三月二十日发表的声明，也毫不掩饰美国是在热中于使用原子武器“于战略目的以及战术目的”。最近正当美国代表在联合国大会侈谈“探求和发展原子能用于和平用途的巨大可能性”的时候，美国派在北大西洋军事联盟的最高统帅格仑瑟将军，就坦率地声言他反对禁止使用原子武器，反对承担这样的义务。这些事实说明，美国一贯拒绝苏联禁止使用原子武器的建议，完全不是偶然的。
    美国政府在谈判中一开始就断然拒绝苏联关于应有中华人民共和国参加原子问题谈判和缔结禁止使用原子武器的国际公约的建议。这更暴露出美国敌视中华人民共和国，不愿真正达成禁止使用原子武器的国际协议。美国侵略集团在原子能谈判的期间，特别嚣张地进行针对中华人民共和国而发的原子战争歇斯底里的叫嚣，已经是众所周知的事实了。
    现在，人们的注意力集中到了联合国大会的身上。联大总务委员会已将美国关于“原子共储”计划的建议列入大会议程。但如上所述，这个建议无助于停止扩充原子武器的生产和消除原子战争的威胁。这一次联合国大会如果不是要使美国得以达到它蒙骗世界舆论的目的，使禁止使用原子武器和裁减军备的和平事业造成新的障碍，以利于侵略者的阴谋，再次损害联合国的威信；那么，它就应该根据苏联的提案进行讨论，并作出足以宽慰人心的决定来。
    全世界爱好和平的国家和人民都热烈同情和支持苏联政府禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器，以及裁减军备的一切建议，这是绝对不容漠视的。中华人民共和国政府和人民完全拥护苏联代表团提出的新提案，认为世界各国人民普遍要求禁止这些武器和裁减军备的愿望必须满足，美国继续推行原子战争准备和扩充军备的政策必须被击败。
