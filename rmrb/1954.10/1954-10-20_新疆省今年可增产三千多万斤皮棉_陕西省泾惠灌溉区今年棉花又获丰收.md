    Xinjiang Province Can Increase Production of Ginned Cotton by Over 30 Million Jin This Year
    Shaanxi Province's Jinghui Irrigation Area Sees Another Bumper Harvest of Cotton This Year
    Xinjiang Province's 820,000 mu of cotton fields have generally yielded a bumper harvest. Farmers of all ethnic groups are now busily picking new cotton. According to surveys from various areas, the province can increase production of ginned cotton by more than 31 million jin this year, exceeding the planned target.
    In Turpan County, a major cotton-producing area, the county's 40,000 mu of cotton fields are estimated to yield an average of 320 jin of seed cotton per mu. The 647,000 mu of cotton fields in Aksu, Shache, Hotan, and other areas in southern Xinjiang generally yield 80 to 100 jin of seed cotton per mu. The unit area yield of cotton in many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams exceeds the local average yield by three to five times. The cotton in the Red Star and Pioneer agricultural production cooperatives in Yuepuhu County and the Tashibayi perennial mutual aid team in Jiashi County can yield 400 to 700 jin of seed cotton per mu. The 300 mu of cotton in the Baike Li and Rouzi agricultural production cooperatives in Turpan County can yield an average of 400 jin of seed cotton per mu, with 37 mu of high-yield land yielding 800 to 1,100 jin per mu. This year, the 70,000 mu of cotton in various state-run farms has also achieved a large-scale bumper harvest, with an estimated average yield of about 300 jin of seed cotton per mu. The 165 mu of cotton in the Provincial Turpan Cotton Experiment Station yields 800 jin of seed cotton per mu, and 10 mu of high-yield land yields an average of 1,500 jin per mu. (Fu Zhendian)
    The cotton in the Jinghui Canal Irrigation Area, a major cotton-producing area in Shaanxi Province, has achieved another bumper harvest this year. According to forecasts, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the entire area is about 70 jin, nearly 20% higher than the average yield of 60 jin per mu last year, and nearly twice as high as the average yield of 25 jin per mu the year before last.
    The strong support from the state and the continuous improvement of cultivation techniques by cotton farmers are important reasons for this year's bumper cotton harvest. According to statistics, this year the state supplied cotton farmers in the irrigation area with more than 284,000 jin of various agents, more than 4.99 million jin of plant fertilizers, more than 2.11 million jin of chemical fertilizers, 98 row planters, 2,000 sprayers, and loans of more than 2.32 billion yuan. The cotton farmers have a high level of enthusiasm for production, and they have promptly prevented various cotton diseases and insect pests and improved various cultivation techniques. The area of inverted stubble cultivation accounted for only 27% of the total cotton field area in the irrigation area last year, but increased to 57% this year. This year, 70% of the villages in the entire irrigation area have established irrigation organizations and carried out reasonable irrigation. In terms of disease and pest control, the principle of "prevention is better than cure" has also greatly reduced the degree of harm caused by diseases and pests compared with previous years. For example, the population density of mirid bugs averaged more than 1,300 per mu last year, but has been reduced to 300 to 400 per mu this year.
    Currently, cotton farmers are busily picking new cotton in the 340,000 mu of cotton fields in the entire irrigation area.

    新疆省今年可增产三千多万斤皮棉
    陕西省泾惠灌溉区今年棉花又获丰收
    新疆省八十二万亩棉花普遍丰收，现在，各族农民正紧张地采摘新花。根据各地调查，全省今年可增产三千一百多万斤皮棉，超额完成计划。
    盛产棉花的吐鲁番县，今年全县四万亩棉花，估计每亩平均可收籽棉三百二十斤。南疆阿克苏、莎车、和阗等专区的六十四万七千亩棉田，一般每亩均可产籽棉八十到一百斤。许多农业生产合作社和互助组的棉花，单位面积产量超过当地一般产量的三倍到五倍。岳普湖县的红星、先锋等农业生产合作社和伽师县塔什巴义等常年互助组的棉花，每亩可收籽棉四百斤到七百斤。吐鲁番县白克里、肉孜两农业生产合作社的三百多亩棉花平均每亩可产籽棉四百斤，三十七亩丰产地每亩可收八百到一千一百斤。今年各国营农场的七万多亩棉花也获得大面积丰收，估计每亩平均可收三百斤左右籽棉，省吐鲁番棉作试验场的一百六十五亩棉花，每亩可收籽棉八百斤，十亩高额丰产地每亩平均可产一千五百斤。　　　　（符镇殿）
    陕西省主要的产棉区——泾惠渠灌溉区的棉花，今年又获得了丰收。根据预测：全区每亩平均产皮棉七十斤左右，比去年每亩平均产量六十斤高出近二成，比前年每亩平均产量二十五斤高出近两倍。
    国家的大力扶助和棉农的不断改进耕作技术，是今年棉花得到丰收的一个重要原因。据统计：今年国家共给灌溉区的棉农供应了各种药剂二十八万四千多斤，植物肥料四百九十九万多斤，化学肥料二百一十一万多斤，条播机九十八架，喷雾器二千架及贷款二十三亿二千多万元。棉农的生产积极性很高，及时防止了各种棉花病虫害，改进了各项耕作技术。去年进行倒槎的面积只占灌溉区棉田总面积的百分之二十七，今年增加到百分之五十七。今年全灌溉区有百分之七十的村建立了灌溉组织，进行了合理的灌溉。在防治病虫害方面，由于贯彻了“防重于治”的方针，也使病虫害为害的程度比往年大为减轻。如盲椿象的虫口密度，去年每亩平均一千三百多头，今年即降低到三百到四百头。
    现在，棉农们正在全灌溉区三十四万余亩的棉田中紧张地采拾新棉。
