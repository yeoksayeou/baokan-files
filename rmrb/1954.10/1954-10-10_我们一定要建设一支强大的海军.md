    We Must Build a Strong Navy
    Delegate to the National People's Congress
    艇长 (艇長) of the Toumenshan Sea Battle Hero Boat Wang Weifu
    As a naval vessel commander, I will always remember what Chairman Mao said at the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949: "We will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy." It was under this great call of Chairman Mao that the Chinese People's Navy began to be built. I was also transferred to participate in this construction endeavor. Along with the growth of the navy, I myself have also grown: I was originally an ordinary soldier of the People's Liberation Army, completely ignorant of any naval technology, but now I have become a vessel commander. Moreover, I have received such a high honor, being elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress. This precisely demonstrates the growth and strengthening of the Chinese People's Navy over the past five years, and also demonstrates the strength and confidence of the Chinese people in building a modern and powerful navy.
    Over the past few years, I have been carrying out the glorious task of defending the motherland with our gunboats: fighting to smash the harassment and sabotage activities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, protecting the production of fishermen and the safety of maritime transport, and fighting for the liberation of Taiwan. I will never forget the fierce and victorious battle of Toumenshan in June 1951. At that time, our navy was still very young, but the enemy was very rampant in this area, frantically disrupting the production of fishermen and hindering maritime transport. Finally, the day of punishment for the enemy arrived. I remember that it was a morning in June, with heavy fog at sea. We received a major combat mission: to escort nine hundred fishing boats, fully loaded with fresh fish, back to port from a certain place. A total of four gunboats were assigned to escort, but three gunboats had to perform other tasks due to some reasons. Thus, the safety of these nine hundred fishing boats was entirely on our one gunboat. All the officers and men of our boat were determined to be highly vigilant, fully prepared, overcome any difficulties, and complete this escort mission.
      When the ship arrived at the Toumenshan sea, cannon fire suddenly sounded in front. The cunning enemy, taking advantage of the heavy fog, came to rob again. Our gunboat immediately bypassed the fishing boats and sailed towards the enemy ship, braving the wind and waves. It turned out to be four large motorized sailing boats of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, intercepting our other three transport ships loaded with supplies. It was truly a case of enemies meeting, eyes blazing with hatred. All the officers and men of the boat were filled with the determination to defeat the enemy, and under the command of political instructor Chen Lifu and commander Yang Yue, they rushed towards the enemy ship. When the enemy ship found that our boat was coming with great force, it was obviously panicked and turned around to flee! At this time, I only heard the political instructor shouting: "Comrades! The time to make merit has come!" All the comrades were also shouting: "Chase! Never let the enemy run away!" So, our gunboat chased from the side, blocking the enemy's path and launching an attack. At this time, the enemy found that we only had one gunboat, so they counterattacked. Three consecutive counterattacks were repelled. The enemy then launched a fourth counterattack, and the battle became even more intense. Comrade Chen Jintang, the cook, was wounded in the abdomen in the fierce battle and fainted, but as soon as he woke up, he shouted angrily: "Comrades, for the motherland, fight on!" Gunner Yang Tonggen was wounded in the head by shrapnel but still insisted on firing at the enemy ship from his post. My right hand was also injured, but the encouragement of the political instructor and the commander, and the heroic and tenacious deeds of Comrade Chen Jintang made me forget the pain. I picked up cotton yarn for wiping the machine and stuffed it into the wound, and continued to fight with my comrades. At this time, the other three sister ships arrived. We began to launch a more fierce shooting at the enemy, hitting the enemy ship with wood chips flying and black smoke billowing. The enemy ship was severely wounded and fled desperately, but we were not willing to let go, chasing closely. Finally, one enemy ship was sunk, and the other three were wounded and fled. This battle not only protected the safety of nine hundred fishing boats and three transport ships, but more importantly, it demonstrated the heroic and tenacious combat quality of the People's Navy, and severely hit the enemy's arrogance in frantically intercepting our ships. It was precisely because of the victory of this battle that our "414" boat was awarded the title of "Toumenshan Sea Battle Hero Boat."
    Our strength has grown and strengthened in battle. The Baiyangshan battle in 1952 is an example. The task of this battle was to contain the enemy at sea and cooperate with the army to liberate a certain island. At that time, as soon as we left the Toumenshan sea, we found that there were more than ten bandit ships heading to Baiyangshan, the largest of which was the "Yiyun" wheel of about 300 tons. Our task was to contain these ships so that they could not reinforce a certain island. Political instructor Chen Lifu ordered my boat to quickly pursue the enemy. When we chased within the range of artillery fire, my boat hit the enemy's command boat four times out of five shots, then rushed to the "Yiyun" wheel. Gunner Long Yinxiang hit the enemy ship's engine room with the first shot, and I also hit the enemy ship's bridge with a single shot. Taking advantage of the enemy's temporary panic, my boat rushed straight up and approached the enemy ship. Although the wind was strong and the waves were high, and the enemy was still shooting, we jumped onto the enemy ship one by one, suppressed the enemy's artillery fire, captured the "Yiyun" wheel, and finally cooperated with the army to liberate a certain island.
    Soon, I was promoted to be the 艇长 (艇長) of the Toumenshan Sea Battle Hero Boat. At this time, I felt even more my lack of cultural knowledge. Just then, the whole army launched a cultural study movement. Everyone was determined to improve their culture and contribute more to the construction of the People's Navy. So, a wave of cultural study was set off on the whole boat. We learned by bending over in the boat on rainy days, by sweating on the deck in the summer, and by making up for learning at night when there were tasks during the day. At the same time as cultural learning, a heat wave of learning naval technology was also launched. In learning navigation, the foreign language codes in the nautical charts were difficult to understand and easy to forget. I kept reading and memorizing them, and soon I memorized all the more than one hundred foreign language codes; when learning to calculate the azimuth tide table, I studied late into the night for several nights and learned it, and then went to the sea to apply it in practice. After such a period of hard study, I finally initially mastered the technical knowledge that a 艇长 (艇長) should have, and the cultural level and technical knowledge of all the comrades on the boat were greatly improved.
    However, we deeply understand that the Chinese People's Liberation War has not yet been finally completed, and American imperialism is still supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitor to attempt to invade us. Our national defense still needs to be further consolidated, and the tasks undertaken by the Chinese People's Navy are still very arduous. We must never be complacent or paralyzed. In order to liberate Taiwan and protect the safety of the motherland's coastal defense, we must continue to work hard and build a strong and modern People's Navy.

### 我们一定要建设一支强大的海军

    我们一定要建设一支强大的海军
    全国人民代表大会代表
    头门山海战英雄艇艇长  王维福
    作为一个海军舰艇的指挥员，我永远记着一九四九年中国人民政治协商会议开幕时毛主席讲的那几句话：“我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”正是在毛主席这一伟大的号召之下，中国人民的海军开始建设了。我也就被调来参加这一建设事业。随着海军的成长，我自己也成长起来：我本来是一个人民解放军的普通战士，完全不懂海军中的任何技术，现在我已成为一个舰艇的指挥员了。而且还得到了这样高的荣誉，当选为全国人民代表大会的代表，这正说明中国人民海军五年来的成长和壮大，也说明了中国人民建设一支现代化强大海军的力量和信心。
    几年来，我一直和我们的炮艇一起，执行着保卫祖国的光荣任务：为粉碎蒋贼军的骚扰破坏活动，为保护渔民生产和海上运输的安全，为解放台湾而战斗着。我永远不能忘记一九五一年六月头门山那次激烈的胜利的战斗。当时，我们的海军还非常年轻，而敌人在这一带却非常猖獗，疯狂地扰乱渔民的生产和阻挠海上的运输。终于，敌人受惩罚的日子到了。记得那是六月的一个早晨，海上浓雾弥漫，我们接受了一项重大的战斗任务：护送满载鲜鱼的九百条渔船从某地返港了。担任护航的共有四艘炮艇，途中三艘炮艇又因故去执行别的任务，于是这九百条渔船的安全就全部担在我们一艘炮艇的身上了。我们全艇的指战员下了决心，一定要提高警惕，充分准备，克服任何艰难困苦，完成这次护航任务。
      船到头门山海面，前面突然响起了炮声，狡猾的敌人乘着漫天大雾，又来打劫了。我们的炮艇立即绕过渔船，乘风破浪向敌船驶去，原来是四只蒋贼军的大机帆船，正在拦截我方另外三只满载物资的运输船。真是仇人相见，分外眼红，全艇指战员充满了打垮敌人的决心，在指导员陈立富、艇长杨岳同志的指挥下，向敌船冲去。敌船发现我艇来势甚猛，显然慌了，掉头就跑！这时只听得指导员在喊：“同志们！立功的时候到了！”全体同志也在喊：“追啊！决不让敌人跑掉！”于是，我们的炮艇就从侧面追了上去，挡住敌人的去路，展开攻击。这时，敌人发现我们只有一艘炮艇，就进行反扑，连续三次反扑都被打退了，敌人又开始了第四次反扑，战斗更加激烈了。炊事员陈金堂同志在激烈的战斗中腹部受伤，晕了过去，但他一苏醒过来就愤怒地高喊：“同志们，为了祖国，要战斗下去！”炮手杨同根同志，头部被弹片打伤了还在他的岗位上坚持向敌船发炮。我的右手也受了伤，可是指导员和艇长的鼓舞，陈金堂同志英勇顽强的战斗事迹使我忘记了疼痛，随手拾起擦机器的棉纱塞住伤口，继续和同志们一起战斗。这时，另外三艘兄弟舰艇赶到了。我们开始向敌人展开更猛烈的射击，只打得敌船木片横飞，黑烟直冒，敌船受了重伤，夺路而逃，我们那肯放松，紧紧追上。终于打沉了一只敌船，另外三只负伤逃窜了。这次战斗不但保护了九百只渔船和三只运输船的安全，更重要的是显示了人民海军英勇顽强的战斗素质，沉重地打击了敌人疯狂拦劫我方船只的气焰。正是由于这次战斗的胜利，我们的“四一四”艇被奖为“头门山海战英雄艇”。
    我们的力量就这样在战斗中成长壮大着，一九五二年百央山战斗就是一个例子。这次战斗的任务是在海上牵制敌人，配合陆军解放某岛。当时，我们一出头门山海面，就发现有十多条匪船向百央山开去，其中最大的一艘舰艇是三百吨左右的“倚云”轮。我们的任务就是牵制这些船舰，使它们不能增援某岛。指导员陈立富命令我艇快速追击敌人，追到炮火射程以内时，我艇五弹四中就把敌人的指挥艇打伤了，接着，就向“倚云”轮冲去。炮手龙银祥同志第一炮就打中了敌船的机舱部，我也一炮打中了敌船的驾驶台，乘着敌人一时的慌乱，我艇便直冲上去，靠拢敌船，虽然风大浪高，敌人还在射击，但我们一个个跳上敌船，压制了敌人的炮火，捕获了“倚云”轮，最后配合陆军解放了某岛。
    不久，我就被提升为头门山海战英雄艇艇长。这时我更感到自己文化知识的不足了。正好全军展开了文化学习运动，大家都决心要提高文化，为人民海军的建设贡献更多的力量，于是全艇掀起了文化学习热潮。雨天在艇里弯着腰学，夏天在甲板上挥着汗学，白天有任务就晚上补着学。和文化学习同时，还展开了学习海军技术的热潮。在学习航海中，海图中的外文代号难懂易忘，我就不停地念，不停地背，很快就把一百多个外文代号全背熟了；学习计算方位潮汐表时，我好几晚上学到深夜，学会了就到海上去实际运用。经过了这样一段艰苦的学习，我终于初步掌握了作为一个艇长应具备的技术知识，全艇同志的文化水平和技术知识也大大提高了。
    但是，我们深深懂得：中国人民解放战争还没有最后完成，美帝国主义还在支持蒋介石卖国贼企图侵略我们，我们的国防还需进一步巩固，中国人民海军担负的任务还是非常艰巨的，绝对不能自满，不能麻痹，为了解放台湾，为了保卫祖国海防的安全，我们一定要继续努力，一定要建设一支强大的现代化人民海军。
