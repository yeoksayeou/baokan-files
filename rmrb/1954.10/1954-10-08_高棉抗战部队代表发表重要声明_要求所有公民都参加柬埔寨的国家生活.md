Xinhua News Agency, 5th. According to Vietnam News Agency, 2nd: Gao Sang, representative of the General Command of the Khmer Resistance Forces, made an important statement on the 24th and 25th of September at the meeting of the Cambodian Joint Ceasefire Committee regarding enabling all Cambodian citizens to participate in Cambodian national life.

Gao Sang pointed out that the Khmer Resistance Forces had made great contributions in the Cambodian people's struggle for national independence and peace, and they are currently earnestly fulfilling the ceasefire agreement. Gao Sang emphasized that just as all Cambodian people are expecting unification and peace, the Cambodian Royal Government has issued a communiqué denying the existence of the Khmer Resistance Forces and plans to exclude people who have participated in the resistance war and other progressive patriots from participating in the upcoming general election. These actions seriously violate the ceasefire agreement and hinder all citizens from participating in Cambodian national life.

Gao Sang then put forward specific and reasonable suggestions on the issue of enabling all citizens to participate in Cambodian national life.

The suggestions first stated that during the eight years of resistance, in addition to establishing the Khmer Resistance Forces, the Cambodian people also established the Khmer Resistance Government and the National United Front for Free Nationalities. During their leadership of the resistance, they strived to improve the living conditions of the people in the resistance base areas, allowing the people to enjoy various democratic rights and freedoms. The resistance government therefore won the love and trust of the people. The suggestions stated that although the ceasefire agreement did not mention the dissolution of the resistance government, we are willing to participate in national life together with other citizens. We suggest that the Cambodian Royal Government instruct local authorities to come to the resistance base areas and assume the responsibility of organizing the government in front of the people.

The suggestions requested the Royal Government to issue an order, specifically promulgating the provisions of the constitution regarding democratic rights, first of all the provisions regarding freedom of speech and freedom of thought.

The suggestions requested the Royal Government to order governments at all levels, the army, and everyone in the country not to take hostile actions that violate the ceasefire agreement, and to immediately release the demobilized soldiers who have been detained, and severely punish personnel who violate the ceasefire agreement.

The suggestions requested the Royal Government to distribute citizenship certificates to all the people in accordance with the provisions of the ceasefire agreement regarding complete non-discrimination against all citizens. The suggestions also requested the release of all prisoners of war and detained civilians.

The suggestions stated that the purpose of the general election and the re-election of the National Assembly is to enable all citizens to participate in national life. Preparations should be made from now on to comply with the spirit of the ceasefire agreement and the final declaration of the Geneva Conference. All Cambodian citizens should be able to freely participate in the general election conducted by secret ballot as electors and candidates; and the basic freedoms of citizens and the safety of electors and candidates should be guaranteed.

Gao Sang finally pointed out that the above-mentioned measures are effective measures to appease the people and unite the people based on the Geneva Agreement and the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia. He called on the Cambodian Royal authorities and all the people to give play to the spirit of patriotism, work together to consolidate peace, complete independence and realize democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. According to Vietnam News Agency, 1st: The delegations of the General Command of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Command of Vietnamese Volunteers have reached an agreement with the delegation of the General Command of the Cambodian Royal Army on the withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteers from Cambodia.

The agreement clearly stipulates the tasks of both parties in withdrawing Vietnamese volunteers, namely managing the withdrawal, ensuring safety, providing transportation, and transporting the sick and wounded.

The agreement stipulates that this withdrawal will be completed in batches. Each batch of Vietnamese volunteers will be escorted by a joint ceasefire team to the Vietnam-Cambodia border during the withdrawal to ensure contact between the two sides and resolve any disputes that may arise during the withdrawal. The withdrawal route will be patrolled by the Cambodian military police responsible for security. If Vietnamese volunteers withdraw by waterway, they will be escorted by a joint ceasefire patrol. Both parties also agreed that within the temporary garrison area of Vietnamese volunteers, Cambodian Royal Army personnel shall not leave the scope of their garrison. During the withdrawal period, the Cambodian Royal Army stationed on the route through which the Vietnamese volunteers will pass should not leave their garrison.

The withdrawal will be completed before the date stipulated in the Geneva Agreement - October 20.

    高棉抗战部队代表发表重要声明
    要求所有公民都参加柬埔寨的国家生活
    【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社二日讯：高棉抗战部队总司令部代表高桑在柬埔寨联合停战委员会九月二十四日和二十五日的会议上，发表了关于使所有的柬埔寨公民都参加柬埔寨的国家生活的重要声明。
    高桑指出，高棉抗战部队在柬埔寨人民为争取国家独立与和平的斗争中曾作了很大的贡献，目前他们正在认真地履行停战协定。高桑强调说，正当目前全体柬埔寨人民都在期望得到统一与和平的时候，柬埔寨王国政府却发表公报，否认高棉抗战部队的存在，并且计划排斥曾进行过抗战的人民和其他进步的爱国人士，不让他们参加即将举行的普选，这些都严重地违反了停战协定，阻碍了所有的公民参加柬埔寨的国家生活。
    高桑接着就关于使所有的公民参加柬埔寨的国家生活问题提出了具体和合理的建议。
    建议首先说，在八年抗战过程中，柬埔寨人民除了建立了高棉抗战部队以外，还建立了高棉抗战政府和全国的自由民族统一战线。它们在领导抗战期间，曾努力改善抗战根据地的人民的生活条件，使人民享受到各种民主权利和自由。抗战政府因而赢得了人民的爱戴和信任。建议说，虽然停战协定没有提到抗战政府的解散，但是我们自愿和其他公民一起参加国家生活。我们建议柬埔寨王国政府指令地方当局到抗战根据地来，在人民面前承担起组织政府的责任。
    建议要求王国政府发布命令，具体地颁布宪法中关于民主权利的规定，首先是关于言论自由和思想自由的规定。
    建议要求王国政府命令各级政府和军队以及国内每一个人不要采取违反停战协定的敌对行动，并立即释放已被拘留的复员军人，严惩违反停战协定的人员。
    建议要求王国政府按照停战协定关于对全体公民完全不加歧视的规定，分发公民证给全体人民。建议还要求释放所有的战俘和被拘平民。
    建议说，普选和重新选举国民议会的目的，是要使得所有的公民都能参加国家生活。从现在起应该进行筹备，以符合停战协定以及日内瓦会议最后宣言的精神。应该使所有的柬埔寨公民都能以选举人和候选人的资格自由地参加以秘密投票方式进行的普选；并保障公民的基本自由和选举人与候选人的安全。
    高桑最后指出，上述措施是根据日内瓦协定和柬埔寨王国宪法而采取的抚慰人民和团结人民的有效措施。他要求柬埔寨王国当局和全体人民发挥爱国精神，共同努力，以巩固和平、完成独立与实现民主。
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社一日讯：高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部的代表团，已和柬埔寨王国军队总司令部的代表团就越南志愿人员撤离柬埔寨一事达成协议。
    协议明确规定了双方在撤退越南志愿人员时的任务，即管理撤退、确保安全、提供交通工具和运送病伤人员等。
    协议规定这次撤退将以分批的方式完成。每批越南志愿人员在撤退时将由一个联合停战小组伴送到越南、柬埔寨边境，以保证双方取得联络并解决撤退时可能发生的任何纠纷。撤退路线将由负责治安的柬埔寨军事警察巡逻。越南志愿人员如从水路撤退，将由联合停战巡逻队护送。双方并同意：在越南志愿人员的临时驻扎区域以内，柬埔寨王国军队人员不得离开其驻地的范围。在撤退期间，在越南志愿人员将经过的路线上驻扎的柬埔寨王国军队不应离开他们的驻地。
    撤退将在日内瓦协定规定的日期——十月二十日以前结束。
