Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd dispatch from New York: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on October 21st. The President of the General Assembly, Van Kleffens, when discussing the report of the Credentials Committee, announced that a motion had been made to vote separately on the credentials of the Kuomintang delegation. He requested an immediate vote on this issue. The result of the vote was 35 in favor of the credentials of the Kuomintang delegation, 10 against, and 3 abstentions. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, India, Indonesia, Sweden, and Burma voted against, while Norway, Denmark, and Israel abstained.

	The head of the Indian delegation, Menon, explaining the reasons for the vote, expressed regret that the President of the General Assembly had submitted the issue to a vote without discussion. Menon said, "We do not believe that the members of this delegation represent China. Recognizing their credentials would be a violation of the United Nations Charter."

	Soviet representative Malik then spoke, emphasizing that only the delegation of the People's Republic of China could represent China and the great Chinese people in the United Nations. He said that the Soviet delegation fully agreed with the reasons for the vote explained by the Indian delegation, which is why they voted against recognizing the credentials of the Kuomintang elements.

	The General Assembly adopted the recommendation of the General Committee by a majority vote, deciding to include the item "Prohibition of Propaganda for a New War" proposed by the Czechoslovak delegation on the agenda of this session and decided to refer it to the Special Political Committee for discussion.

	The General Assembly then discussed the issue of including the two items proposed by the Soviet delegation on the agenda: "Violation of Freedom of Navigation on the High Seas off the Coast of China" and "Acts of Aggression Against the People's Republic of China and Responsibility of the United States Navy for These Acts."

	Soviet representative Vyshinsky pointed out in his speech that the General Committee's majority decision to postpone consideration of including the above two issues on the agenda was incorrect and completely unfounded.

	Vyshinsky traced the history, saying that it was the second time the United Nations General Assembly had discussed the Soviet proposal to include "Violation of Freedom of Navigation on the High Seas off the Coast of China" as an important and urgent issue on the agenda. Last time, the General Assembly decided to postpone the discussion of this proposal for a few days. But more than just "a few days" had passed, and now it was time for the General Assembly to fulfill its original decision.

	Vyshinsky said that in the General Committee, some people said that the postponement was supposedly necessary because the French government was negotiating with the Kuomintang group regarding the Soviet tanker "Tuapse." He pointed out that this argument was bankrupt. The negotiations regarding the "Tuapse" could not solve the entire issue of freedom of navigation on the high seas off the coast of China. The fundamental point of the issue was the violation of the principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas—one of the most important principles of international law. In accordance with the current tasks of the United Nations, the General Assembly must include this issue on the agenda and immediately take steps to stop the Kuomintang elements' piracy in the seas off the coast of China.

	Speaking of acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and the responsibility of the United State Navy for these acts, Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation suggested including this issue on the agenda, in addition to other reasons, based on the fact that the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina had created favorable conditions for resolving a series of other outstanding international issues to further ease international tensions. He said that some people said that the consideration and resolution of the above issues might have the effect of intensifying world tensions, and the Soviet delegation could not agree with this statement. Whether world tensions are eased or intensified does not depend on whether certain issues, even serious ones, are discussed, but on whether facts such as acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China continue to occur or are stopped.

	Following Vyshinsky, the Kuomintang elements spoke, and his speech showed that the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan did not intend to stop their piracy.

	Representatives of the United States, Britain, and France supported the majority decision of the General Committee, repeating the arguments they had made in the General Committee.

	Polish representative Skrzeszewski said that the above issues should be included on the agenda without further delay, because the resolution of these issues would help consolidate peace in the Far East and ease international tensions. He continued that his country was particularly concerned about the early cessation of the Kuomintang elements' piracy, because merchant ships of the People's Republic of Poland had been suffering losses due to these acts.

	The General Assembly adopted the recommendation of the General Committee by a majority vote: to postpone consideration of the two items proposed by the Soviet delegation. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against.

    关于把苏联提出的美国侵略我国提案列入联大议程问题
    联大全体会议仍无理决定暂不考虑
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会在十月二十一日举行全体会议，大会主席范克里芬斯在谈到批准证书审查委员会的报告时，宣布有人动议单独表决国民党代表团的权力问题，他要求立即就这个问题进行表决。表决结果有三十五票赞成国民党代表团的权力，十票反对，三票弃权。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、印度、印度尼西亚、瑞典和缅甸投票反对，挪威、丹麦和以色列弃权。
    印度代表团团长梅农解释投票动机时，对大会主席没有经过讨论就把这个问题交付表决表示遗憾。梅农说，我们不认为这个代表团的组成人员代表中国。承认他们的权力就是破坏联合国宪章。
    苏联代表马立克接着发言，他着重指出，唯有中华人民共和国代表团才能在联合国代表中华人民共和国和伟大的中国人民。他说苏联代表团完全赞成印度代表团所解释的投票动机，正因为如此，所以他们投票反对承认国民党分子的所谓全权证书。
    大会以多数票通过总务委员会的建议，决定把捷克斯洛伐克代表团所提出的“禁止新的战争的宣传”这一项目列入本届会议议程，并决定交特别政治委员会讨论。
    大会随即讨论把苏联代表团提出的“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”和“侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”两个项目列入议程的问题。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言指出，总务委员会多数决定暂不考虑把上述两个问题列入议程，是不正确的，是完全没有根据的。
    维辛斯基追溯说，联合国大会讨论苏联提出的把“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”作为一个重要而迫切的问题列入议程的建议，已经是第二次了。在上一次，大会决定延期几天再讨论这个建议。但是已经过了不止“几天”了，现在该是大会履行它原来的决定的时候了。
    维辛斯基说，在总务委员会上，有人说由于法国政府正和国民党集团进行关于苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的谈判，所以延期据说就是必要的。他指出，这种说法是破产了的。关于“图阿普斯号”的谈判并不能解决整个关于中国海面航行自由的问题。问题的根本之点在于破坏了公海航行自由原则——最重要的国际法原则之一。依照联合国当前的任务，大会必须把这个问题列入议程，并立即采取步骤来制止国民党分子在中国海面的海盗活动。
      谈到侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任，维辛斯基说，苏联代表团建议把这个问题列入议程，除了根据其他理由以外，还根据这样一个事实：朝鲜停战和印度支那和平的恢复已创造了有利条件，便于解决一系列的其他悬而未决的国际问题，以进一步缓和国际紧张局势。他说，有些人说上述问题的考虑和解决可能产生使世界紧张局势加剧的效果，苏联代表团不能同意这种说法。世界紧张局势是缓和还是加剧，不在于是否讨论某些问题，甚至严重的问题，而是取决于像侵略中华人民共和国的行为之类事实究竟是仍然发生呢，还是受到制止。
    继维辛斯基之后发言的是国民党分子，他的发言表明，盘踞在台湾的蒋介石集团并不打算停止他们的海盗活动。
    美、英、法三国代表支持总务委员会的多数决定，把他们在总务委员会上提出的论点又重复一遍。
    波兰代表斯克热歇夫斯基说，应当不再拖延地把上述问题列入议程，因为这些问题的解决，将有助于远东和平的巩固和国际紧张局势的缓和。他继续说，他的国家特别关心使国民党分子的海盗行为早日被制止，因为，波兰人民共和国的商船由于这些行为一直在遭受损失。
    大会以多数票通过了总务委员会的建议：暂不考虑苏联代表团提出的两个项目。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克投票反对。
