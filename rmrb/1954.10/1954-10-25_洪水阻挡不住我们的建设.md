    Floods Cannot Stop Our Construction
    Wen Yao
    During the days when the people of Wuhan were battling the floods, those who stood fast at their production and construction posts were waging a hard struggle alongside the flood prevention army fighting on the front lines of the levees. While unconditionally guaranteeing support for the needs of the levee front lines, they overcame all kinds of difficulties to protect the safety of their construction sites and factories, and persisted in production. Under the threat of the flood, our socialist cause continued to advance, and the biggest flood in a century could not stop us.
    Supporting the flood prevention army means defending our socialist construction; the workers building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and other workers in various fields have made great contributions in this regard. Dozens of bulldozers, scrapers, and root removers on the Yangtze River Bridge connecting lines, when urgently opening up sources of earth, took people and machines to several soil yards twenty or thirty miles outside the city. In the Shekou area alone, more than 67,000 cubic meters of loess were guaranteed to be supplied within twelve days. Yangtze River Bridge divers who had previously dived into cofferdams or wooden caissons to plug leaks while building the piers of the Han River Railway Bridge were often transferred to the most dangerous parts of the levees, diving into the water to find and plug leaks in sluice gates or levee walls; the riggers and riveters who were still assembling the Han River Railway Bridge beams also formed a shock team for pile driving and rescue; the serious pipe leakage incidents at the Wusheng Road intersection in Hanyang and the Wuhan Customs in Hankou were controlled by the flood prevention headquarters dispatching them to drive steel sheet piles to stop the development of the dangerous situation; when the flood broke through the peak of 29.5 meters and continued to rise, and the supply of loess was most tense, the people building the Yangtze River Bridge dug out more than 30,000 cubic meters from the already solidified bridgehead roadbed to supply the needs of the levee front line for reinforcement and heightening. There were also the line workers of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau, who installed two 35-kilometer-long high-voltage power lines in nineteen days to supply electricity for lighting and draining water from the entire levee line; this work normally takes sixty days. Some mechanical factory workers who had never made iron anchors before bravely made 3,600 150-kilogram iron anchors in three days to meet the needs of positioning wave-proof wooden rafts. … All kinds of support like this, like the materials supported by the people all over the country, guaranteed the victory of the flood prevention battle and boosted the morale of the flood prevention army on the front line.
    While the battle to support the levee front line was advancing victoriously, the people who stood fast at their production and construction posts were simultaneously pushing our production and construction forward continuously.
    The people building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge did not relax their determination to strive for early completion of the task even during the most tense and arduous moments of the flood prevention struggle. They achieved victories in all projects on the fourteen-kilometer dotted line while persisting in battle.
    The Han River Railway Bridge is an important part of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Only by repairing the Han River Railway Bridge can the equipment needed to build the Yangtze River Bridge be directly and smoothly transported to the Jiangbian in Hanyang. During the tense period of flood prevention, the workers building the Han River Railway Bridge completed the entire beam erection project. We can now walk from the Hankou side of the Han River Railway Bridge to the Hanyang side. Three months ago, the workers had just rescued several piers in the water from the water, and then the Han River rose. At that time, the torrents crashed against the city gate-like piers, and the piers were completely empty on top. Now, the concrete beams, steel plate beams, and the longest standard lower-bearing flower beams in the center three spans that we walked across were all poured and assembled during the two months of flood prevention struggle. When pouring the two concrete beams on the Hanyang side, the flood submerged the rebar tying site at the bridgehead, and scaffolding had to be erected immediately to raise the work. The construction site's derrick boat was transferred to rescue work. What to do? The carpenters of the Han River Railway Bridge said: If there are no machines, we will use people, and we must complete the scaffolding installation task! They spent four days in the chest-deep water, using sleepers to build a scaffold more than ten meters high. According to the engineers, it would take three days even with a derrick boat. The original design for erecting the middle three flower beams was to float them by boat to the gap between the piers. This method would require closing the waterway for two or three days. At that time, the river was rising sharply, and a large amount of earth and stone and other equipment needed to be transported from the upper reaches of the Han River, and the waterway could not be closed for a moment. The workers accepted the suggestion of Soviet experts and decided to use the cantilever dragging method. According to this method, the workers riveted the three flower beams, originally 55 meters long and 180 tons each, together on the bridgehead roadbed. The beam erection preparation work was completed on August 23, and a cantilever test was conducted. On September 27, when the sound of cheers for Comrade Mao Zedong's election as Chairman of the People's Republic of China reached here, this huge bridge, more than 160 meters long, was dragged across the concrete beams and steel plate beams and slid to the center of the bridge. Now, we can see the traces left by the biggest flood in a century on each pier, as if saying, "I have been here." The towering steel frame seems to answer its impolite provocation: "Who can stop our progress?"
    While the Han River Railway Bridge beam erection project was in full swing, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge geological drilling team also completed the geological drilling and surveying and mapping work on both sides of Wuchang and Hanyang, and sorted out the geological data collected over the past four years. In particular, geological drilling of four main piers was completed in the eight piers in the riverbed.
    The geological drilling of these piers was often carried out in storms and huge waves. The mighty Yangtze River flows through more than 40 kilometers of Wuhan City. The location of the Yangtze River Bridge is in a place where the distance between the two banks is relatively short. The famous Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai has a poem about this place: "Who says this water is wide, it is as narrow as a ribbon; the Yellow Crane Tower in Jiangxia, the green mountains of Hanyang County..." However, this "ribbon" is actually more than 1,100 meters wide, and the water flow is also relatively turbulent. When the water level rises above 27 meters, not to mention that it is not easy to keep the drilling pipe upright and prevent the water pressure from bending the drilling pipe, even anchoring the drilling boat is an arduous task. Late at night on June 25, in heavy wind and rain, the drilling boat that was preparing to install the casing under Pier No. 4 was tossed about by the wind and waves like a baby's cradle. The casing protecting the drill pipe was originally lowered vertically from the deck between the two drilling boats. Now, the waves lifted the hull, and when it fell, the drill pipe left its original position, sometimes even overturning the drill platform next to it. The drilling workers, technicians, and sailors were dizzy and vomited from the bumps, and their clothes were soaked. Everyone still tried their best to protect the drilling rig; they were knocked over by the waves, and then got up and continued to work. A young Communist Youth League member even shouted with a smile: "Comrades, we can drill through rocks, what are we afraid of these winds and waves?" They finally successfully completed the task, and the rock core recovery rate reached 80%. The positioning and lowering of the pipe for the Drilling No. 7 pier also took place during the rapid rise of the flood in early July. That day, it took four tugboats to tow the drilling boat to the location of the pier. In the rushing river, the first group of drilling boats used nine iron anchors plus a three-ton iron chain to stabilize it. Pier No. 7 is one of the Yangtze River Bridge piers with the deepest water level and the most complex geological conditions. The drilling site is 40 meters deep, the water flow speed is more than 3 meters per second, and the riverbed cover is very shallow, so there are many difficulties. The workers and technicians discussed and came up with ways to overcome the difficulties. To prevent the drill pipe from tilting and not standing firmly after reaching the bottom of the river, they added more protective ropes to tie the drill pipe and welded steel nails on the pipe head. Late at night on July 13, just as the first flood peak of the Yangtze River was hitting the drilling boat, they heard a faint but clear "clang clang" sound—the drill pipe reached the bedrock.
    At about the same time, the overpass spanning Jiefang Avenue and Zhanggong Dike was erected; the preparation of machinery and materials for the Han River Highway Bridge downstream of the Hanyang Iron Bridge was preliminarily completed, and the start of trial pile construction was planned; the art design of the Yangtze River Bridge was also actively underway. Relevant experts and scholars examined the topography of Snake Mountain, Turtle Mountain, and the distant and near views of the future bridge in early July, and collected and compared national artistic forms; they observed, visited, and took photos, quietly doing their work.
    While the various tasks of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge were continuously advancing, the city's employees who stood fast at their production posts were also working selflessly, protecting state property, and continuously creating wealth for the country. In the three months of fighting the floods, railway workers transported more than 1,129,000 tons of materials. The Municipal Planning Commission released a bulletin on the implementation of the city's factory plans in July and August. State-owned factories and joint state-private factories all completed or exceeded the state plan. The state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory overproduced 80 bales of cotton yarn in July and another 142.87 bales in August. In August, the Han River had already risen above the gate of their factory. Young girls often washed their hands and feet after carrying dozens of loads of soil and then went into the bright workshop to spin the snow-white cotton yarn. The Hubei Farm Implement Factory successfully trial-produced the North China No. 20 (8-inch) walking plow. Even when the highest water level of 29.73 meters arrived, they conducted field trials in the fields of the Hujingshan Mutual Aid Group in the suburbs of Wuchang.
    It is difficult for us to talk about each factory one by one, because many stories about persisting in production can be told in any factory or workshop. In the flood prevention struggle, the workers more closely combined their personal ideals and interests with the socialist construction of the entire factory, city, and country. During the most tense moments of the flood threat, many workers stayed in their factories during their rest time and were unwilling to go home.
    These people who stood fast at their construction sites and factory posts, guaranteed support for the flood prevention struggle, and persisted in the advancement of projects and production, once again demonstrated that the Mao Zedong era is an era in which tens of millions of people create miracles; no difficulties can hinder our socialist construction from advancing.

    洪水阻挡不住我们的建设
    文尧
    在武汉人民同洪水搏斗的日子里，坚守在生产建设岗位上的人们，和战斗在堤防前线的防汛大军同时进行着艰苦的斗争。他们一面无条件地保证支援堤防前线的需要，一面克服万般困难保护着自己的工地、工厂的安全，坚持着生产。在洪水威胁下，我们的社会主义事业继续在前进，百年来最大的洪水也阻挡不住我们。
    支援防汛大军，就是保卫我们的社会主义建设；建设武汉长江大桥的工人和其他方面的工人们，在这方面都贡献了极大的力量。长江大桥联络线上的几十部推土机、铲运机和除根机，在紧急开辟土源的时候，连人带机器分途开到了市区以外二、三十里地的几处土场。仅滠口一处地方，十二天内就保证供应了黄土六万七千多立方。曾经在建筑汉水铁桥桥墩，潜入围堰或者木沉井的水中堵塞漏洞的长江大桥潜水工，经常被调到堤防最危急的地方，潜入水下去摸索堵塞闸门或堤墙的漏洞；那些还正在拼架汉水铁桥桥梁的装吊工、拼铆工也组成了一只突击打桩抢险队；汉阳武圣路口和汉口武汉关两处严重的管漏险象，就是防汛总指挥部调动他们赶去打下钢板桩制止了险情的发展；当洪水突破二十九·五公尺的高峰继续上涨，而黄土供应最感紧张的时候，建设长江大桥的人们更把已经筑实了的桥头路基，挖出了三万多方供应堤防前线加固加高的需要。还有那武汉冶电业局的线路工人，十九天中安装了三十五公里长的两条高压电线，供应堤防全线的照明用电和排除渍水用电；这项工作平时进行要六十天。一些从来没有做过铁锚的机械厂工人，勇敢地在三天里制成三千六百个一百五十公斤重的铁锚，供给防浪木排定位的需要。……类似这样的种种支援，如同全国各地人民所支援的物资一样，保证了防汛战斗的胜利，鼓舞了前线防汛大军的斗志。
    就在支援堤防前线的战斗胜利前进的时候，坚持在生产建设岗位上的人们，同时把我们的生产建设，不断地向前推进。
    建设武汉长江大桥的人们，就是在防汛斗争最紧张最艰苦的时刻里，也没有放松他们为争取提早完成任务的决心。在那十四公里长的点线上的各项工程，他们都在坚持战斗中，取得了胜利。
    汉水铁桥是武汉长江大桥的一个重要组成部分，修好了汉水铁桥，才能够把建筑长江大桥所需用的器材，直接顺利地输送到汉阳的江边。就在防汛斗争紧张进行的时期，建设汉水铁桥的工人完成了全部架梁的工程。我们现在可以从汉水铁桥汉口这边桥台走到汉阳那边去。三个月前，工人们刚把水中的几座桥墩抢出水面，汉水就涨起来了，那时，激流冲撞着城门一样的桥墩，桥墩上面全是空的。现在我们走过的混凝土梁、钢板梁和那正中三孔最长的标准下承花梁，都是在防汛斗争的两个多月中浇灌拼架起来的。在浇灌汉阳那边两孔混凝土梁的时候，洪水浸没了桥头扎钢筋的工地，必须立刻搭好排架升高作业。工地的扒杆吊船被调出抢险去了，怎么办？汉水铁桥的木工们说：没有机具用人来，一定要把排架安装任务完成！他们就在齐人胸口深的渍水中，花了四天时间，用枕木一根根地搭成了一座十几公尺高的排架。据工程师说，就是用吊船也得三天。原来设计架设中间三孔花梁，是用船浮运到孔挡间去。这个办法要封闭航道两三天。那时江水在猛涨，需要从汉水上游载运大量的土方石方和其他器材，航道一刻也不能封闭。工人们接受了苏联专家的建议，决定改用悬臂拖拉的办法。按这个办法，工人们就在桥头路基上，把三个原来每孔五十五公尺长一百八十吨重的花梁拼铆拢来。八月二十三日就完成了架梁准备工作，进行了悬臂试验。九月二十七日当欢呼毛泽东同志当选中华人民共和国主席的声音传到这里的时候，这座长达一百六十多公尺的巨大桥梁被拖过混凝土梁、钢板梁，滑到桥的正中。现在，我们可以看到那百年来最大的一次洪水在每个桥墩上遗留下来的痕迹，好像说：“我到过这里。”那高耸的钢架好像回答它的无礼的挑衅：“谁能挡住我们前进？”
    当汉水铁桥架梁工程紧张进行的时候，武汉长江大桥地质钻探队也完成了武昌、汉阳两岸地质钻探和测绘的工作，整理出四年来所搜集的地质资料。特别是在河槽八个桥墩中，完成了四座主要桥墩的地质钻探。
    这些桥墩的地质钻探，经常是在暴风巨浪中进行的。浩荡的长江流过武汉市区四十多公里，长江大桥定位的地点是在两岸距离较短的地方。唐代名诗人李白有一首诗说的就是这里：“谁道此水广，狭如一匹练；江夏黄鹤楼，青山汉阳县……”但是，这“一匹练”实地却有一千一百多公尺宽，水流也是比较湍急的地方。水位上涨到二十七公尺以上，不说钻管下去不容易保持位置端正和不让水的压力把钻管折弯，就是钻探船抛锚定位，也是一桩艰苦的工作。六月二十五日那天深夜，大风大雨，正在准备四号墩下套管的钻探船，被风浪播弄着像婴儿的摇篮。保护钻杆的套管原本是从两只钻探船之间的夹板中，垂直下沉，现在，浪头掀起船身，落下时，钻管便离开了原来的位置，有时，还顶翻旁边的钻台。钻探工人、技术人员和水手们，颠簸得晕眩呕吐，全身衣服也湿透了。大家仍然竭力去抢护着钻机；被浪颠倒了，又爬起来干。一个青年团员还笑着喊道：“同志们，岩石我们也能钻穿，这点风浪怕什么？”他们最后终于胜利完成任务，岩心取得率达到百分之八十。钻探七号墩的钻探船定位下管，也正是在七月初洪水猛涨的时候。那天用了四条拖轮才把钻探船拖到桥墩的位置。在奔腾叫啸的江水中，第一组钻探船使用了九个铁锚加上一根三吨重的铁链方才定住。七号墩是长江大桥各号桥墩中水位最深、地质情况最复杂的一个。进行钻探的地方，水深四十公尺，水流速度每秒钟在三公尺以上，河槽覆盖层很浅，困难是很多的。工人们和技术员商量想出克服困难的办法，不叫钻管倾斜和到江底后站不住，就多加保护绳绊住钻管，在管头上焊上钢钉。七月十三日的深夜，正是长江第一次洪峰撞击着钻探船的时候，他们听到了微弱而又清脆的“锵锵”的声音——钻管下到了岩盘。
    也就是在这些时候，跨过解放大道和张公堤上空的跨线桥，架设起来了；在汉阳铁桥下游的汉水公路桥初步完成了机具材料的准备，计划试桩开工；长江大桥的美术设计也在积极进行。有关的专家、学者们，就在七月初审视了蛇山、龟山和未来大桥远处、近处的地形，搜集、比较着民族艺术形式；他们观察、访问、拍摄照片，宁静地做着他们的工作。
    就在武汉长江大桥的各项工作不断前进的时候，全市坚守在生产岗位的职工们，也都是在忘我地进行劳动，保卫着国家财产，不断地为国家创造着财富。在和洪水搏斗的三个月当中，铁路工人们运输的物资就有一百十二万九千多吨。市计划委员会发布过七月、八月全市工厂执行计划情况的公报，国营工厂、公私合营工厂都是完成或者超额完成了国家计划。国营武汉第一棉纺织厂七月份超额生产了八十件棉纱，八月份又超额了一百四十二点八七件。八月间汉水已经高过了他们工厂的大门。年轻的姑娘们常常在挑了几十担土以后，洗洗手脚，又进到明亮的车间去纺织那雪白的棉纱。湖北农具厂试制华北二十号（八吋）步犁成了功。就是在二十九·七三公尺最高水位到来的时候，他们在武昌郊区胡景山互助组的田地里，进行了田间试验。
    我们很难把一个一个工厂都谈过来，因为哪一个厂、哪一个车间，都可以讲出许多关于坚持生产的故事。工人们在防汛斗争中把个人的理想、利益，同整个工厂、城市和国家的社会主义建设更紧密地结合起来了。在洪水威胁最紧张的时刻，许多工人们在休息的时间也都要守在自己厂房里不愿回家。
    这些坚守在工地、工厂岗位上，保证了支援防汛斗争，坚持着工程和生产前进的人们，再一次说明了毛泽东时代是一个千万人民创造奇迹的时代；没有任何困难可以阻碍我们的社会主义建设前进。
