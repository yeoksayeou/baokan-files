    At the Construction Site of New Kakhovka
    —An Account of a Visit to Ukraine, Part 8
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    The east had not yet turned white, and the banks of the Dnieper River were still hidden in a hazy outline. I stood on the deck of the bow, and the river breeze blowing towards me carried a fresh scent. In the haze, the speedboat seemed to slow down, as if traveling on a wide and long asphalt road. At the end of this black, oily road, on the left, countless lights twinkled in rows and clusters, as if the Milky Way in the sky had fallen there.
      "What place is that?" I asked the attendant on the boat, although I had already guessed that this was our destination.
    The attendant, speaking Russian with a Ukrainian accent, replied with a smile, "New Kakhovka. Four years ago, it was just a sandy area. Because of the construction of water conservancy projects, it is now a city."
    After arriving in New Kakhovka, we had the opportunity to get to know the "rear" of this construction front. Originally, we thought the water conservancy project was being built in Kakhovka, but we learned that Kakhovka remained ten kilometers away to the north, while the project was being built in New Kakhovka. This new city, which had newly appeared on the map, developed southward along the left bank of the Dnieper River. The city currently has about five hundred one- to three-story buildings, housing more than fifteen thousand residents. The city has various cultural buildings serving the residents—the employees of the construction company and their families: seven libraries, three ten-year schools, a branch of the Odessa Hydrotechnical Institute, a cultural palace, a theater, a hospital, and so on. Many auxiliary construction enterprises have been established, such as concrete factories, mechanical factories, installation factories, and sawmills. More than 170 kilometers of railways, about 60 kilometers of highways, and about 200 kilometers of high- and low-voltage power lines have been laid. These conditions, as well as the support of the entire Soviet Union, guarantee the smooth progress of the construction project.
    We asked Alexander Petrovich Bechin, the deputy chief engineer of the "Dnieper Construction Bureau," to take us to the construction site. The "Dnieper Construction Bureau" is responsible for the entire hydroelectric power station project. On the way, we passed the reinforced concrete structure factory and the concrete factory. The reinforced concrete structures, concrete, and other building materials needed for the construction site are all prepared by the factory first and then transported there. In this way, the project can proceed quickly. The concrete factory is divided into three parts, each with four concrete mixers, each with a capacity of 2,400 liters. The factory is fully mechanized and produces 6,000 cubic meters of concrete per day and night. After this factory completes its work here, it can be dismantled and transported elsewhere.
    We arrived at the central area of the construction site. Here, construction workers were working around the clock in shifts. The bodies of huge reinforced concrete spillway dams, hydroelectric power stations, and sluice gates are taking shape in the foundation pit. We walked to the left bank of the Dnieper River. After the entire project on the left bank is completed and the river's course is changed, an earth dam with a volume of about 8 million cubic meters and a length of about 1 kilometer will be built here to connect with the right bank. Near the shore, a row of steel piles is planted in the earth on three sides, and many pumping devices are installed everywhere. It is by relying on them that the seepage of the river water is resisted, ensuring the dryness of the foundation pit and the safe construction on the foundation pit. Because the foundation pit is fifteen meters lower than the river surface, it was excavated for half a year using mud suction machines, excavating 4 million cubic meters of soil.
    On the foundation pit, connected to the earth dam that will cut off the river in the future, is a half-kilometer-long reinforced concrete spillway dam. The streamlined piers of this long dam have been built very high. They constitute twenty-eight gates, each twelve meters wide. In the future, when the water is high, it will overflow to the downstream through these channels.
    Parallel to this growing spillway dam is the hydroelectric power station itself. From the poured concrete and the constructed reinforcing steel, the position for installing the turbines can already be distinguished. Preparations have already been made here for the installation of the first turbine (after we left, installation began on August 17). The various components of the 1,000-ton turbine generator will be installed using a crane with a lifting capacity of 250 tons. A total of five turbine generators, each generating 50,000 kilowatts, will be installed in the hydroelectric power station. The turbine selected for use here is one whose rotating blades with a rotor diameter of eight meters can be rotated.
    To the left of the hydroelectric power station, separated by the future earth dam, a navigation lock has been built halfway up. After the hydroelectric power station is completed, the difference in water level between the upstream and downstream utilized by the turbines will be sixteen meters, so only one larger lock will be built.
    In this way, on the square-like foundation pit, stands a three- to four-kilometer-long high water conservancy building. From the foundation pit to its lower part, it has already taken shape. Its upper part exposes a steel structure resembling a sky bridge. A wooden bridge, twenty-one meters high and more than one kilometer long, has been built on top of the building. Light rails are laid on the bridge. The booms of many tower-shaped large cranes are busy. These electric cranes, which move on the rails, have lifting capacities of 40 tons and 25 tons.
    The huge steel skeletons and special wall panels prepared by the factory are transported to the construction site by trucks. Cranes hoist the steel skeletons, some weighing as much as ten tons, to the building. Workers weld them together. Several people sit on the already welded steel structure to inspect it. Only after the inspection is qualified do the workers enclose the steel structure with factory-made wall panels and then pour concrete. These wall panels are also finely made of concrete and reinforcing steel, five meters long, two and a half meters wide, and eight or nine centimeters thick, with a smooth exterior and an interior that can be hung on the steel skeleton. When the concrete solidifies, these wall panels become the exterior of the building without any processing.
    Motorized convertibles shuttle back and forth on the wooden bridge. They carry the concrete prepared by the factory here. Four iron buckets are arranged on the convertible, holding a total of twelve cubic meters of concrete. The concrete is discharged from the bottom of the bucket through the funnel tube into the steel skeleton. In some places, cranes hoist the concrete buckets carried by trucks to a high place. In some places, automatic devices are conveying concrete.
    At the construction site of the spillway dam, we saw a "block" that had already been erected with steel skeletons, enclosed with special wall panels, and poured with concrete. The concrete had been poured halfway up. Several workers inserted vibrators similar to pneumatic picks into the concrete to stir it evenly. This "block" has a volume as large as 7,000 cubic meters! It can be poured well in two and a half to three days and nights. Each shift only requires twenty workers to work.
    We also took a motorboat to see the project on the right bank. There, mud suction machines and hydraulic mud flushers were working intensely. The sand and soil prepared for building the dam had already been piled up into small mountains. It was removed by the mud suction machines from the Cossack Continent in the heart of the river. A mud suction machine resembling a ship was docked on the edge of the continent, and its mud conveying pipe was erected to the right bank of the cliff stone. It can suck 1,000 cubic meters of mud per hour and discharge the mud to a height of 80 meters. Such a machine replaces the labor of a thousand people.
    The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station project requires a total of about 1.5 million cubic meters of concrete to be poured, 28 million to 30 million cubic meters of earthwork to be done, and 18,600 tons of metal structures to be installed. Such a vast project is progressing rapidly. From the pouring of the first cubic meter of concrete to the present, which is more than a year, more than 600,000 cubic meters of concrete have been poured and more than 20 million cubic meters of earthwork have been done.
    This is not only due to the high degree of mechanization of the construction project, but also to the boiling work enthusiasm of the employees on the construction front.
    According to the regulations of the Soviet government, the construction period of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station is from 1951 to 1956. In order to support the resolutions of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the construction workers voluntarily proposed to complete the construction one year ahead of schedule, so that the five engines with a total generating capacity of 250,000 kilowatts could work in 1955. The employees carefully studied ways to tap potential capabilities in organization and technology. They improved the use of machines, widely adopted special wall panels, accelerated the construction of steel skeletons and installation work, and so on. In the past, only 1,000 cubic meters of concrete "blocks" could be poured, but now 7,000 cubic meters can be poured. The larger the concrete "block," the fewer seams there are. This not only speeds up the progress of the work but also improves the quality of the work. Last December, the Kakhovka climate was as cold as minus 31 degrees Celsius in the open air. However, the workers poured half as much concrete as in November.
    We watched back and forth on the construction site. Announcements of over-fulfilling the plan and slogans for striving for higher achievements can be seen everywhere. Vasily Vasilyevich Gonykh, the chief engineer of the Spillway Dam Construction and Installation Management Office, told us that the reason why the workers can complete the plan ahead of schedule, in addition to the mechanization of the work and the improvement of technology, is mainly because the workers care about the work with the attitude of masters. For example, not long ago, the work of pouring concrete was accelerated, and the supply of concrete was once insufficient, and the workers were very worried. They took advantage of the spare time to do a lot of preparatory work for pouring concrete. Later, when the concrete supply was up, everyone was very happy.
    In front of the spillway dam field (where the riverbed will be in the future), I met Ivan Fedoseyevich Grushenko, the captain of a concrete team of this dam. His team has twenty-four people, including five ethnic groups: Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Moldavian, and Tatar. He and his father work in the same team. Grushenko is twenty-nine years old this year. He joined the Patriotic War when he was in the seventh grade, and studied for another year after being demobilized. He came here four years ago when the project started and worked on earthwork first.
    Grushenko talked about the thoughts and efforts of the workers in his team. He said: Building the Kakhovka water conservancy project is very beneficial to the development of agriculture. Electricity can be used in agriculture, and canals can overcome drought. Therefore, the workers want to complete the project ahead of schedule. His father is fifty-eight years old and does not look for other leisurely work, which is exactly what he thinks. In the past, the workers were not skilled, and the blocks of concrete poured were very small. Now 70% of the workers in the team have completed the concrete worker training class (this training class lasts for three months, with classes four times a week, two or three hours each time), which has improved their skills. The blocks of concrete poured have also been expanded. Therefore, the entire team overfulfills the plan by one or two times every month. The workers fully exert their initiative. When there is not enough concrete, they prepare for pouring concrete. When there is nothing to do, they help other teams and others. Grushenko said: "After building this water conservancy project, we will go to do another one."
    On the way from Zaporozhye to New Kakhovka by boat, we noticed that there were no trees on both banks. After arriving in New Kakhovka, we learned that it was going to be flooded when the water conservancy project was completed, so the trees were cut down first. The future Kakhovka Reservoir will be 250 kilometers long and 5 to 20 kilometers wide, with a water capacity of 19 billion cubic meters. The water level from the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station to the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station will be raised.
    Along the two banks of these 250 kilometers, collective farms, machine tractor stations, livestock farms, oil depots, and docks are being relocated very well. We arrived at the old site and new residence of the "Little Kakhovka" village on the left bank of the Dnieper River. Its old site will be flooded, and the houses there have been demolished. With the help of the government, the villagers have built more than 200 stone houses and public buildings, shops, and agronomy museums in the new place; several schools and clubs are being built; livestock farms, workshops, and warehouses have been set up. The new residence is much more beautiful than the old site.
    In the Sixth Construction Office of the irrigation system, we learned about the progress of the irrigation project. This construction office is responsible for excavating the canal network near Kakhovka. There are already seven or eight construction offices. Several construction offices will be established within this year. These construction offices are under the leadership of the Ukrainian Water Conservancy Construction Bureau and have no direct relationship with the Dnieper Construction Bureau, which is building the hydroelectric power station. The Fifth Construction Office in Zaporozhye Oblast has already opened half of the canals and will complete all the work this year. It is also constructing waterproof earth weirs at several locations on the bank of the reservoir, which is sometimes more advantageous than relocating villages. The Thirteenth Construction Office in Kherson Oblast has excavated 500,000 cubic meters of soil. They deepened the Mogurets River, a tributary of the Dnieper River in Kherson Oblast, and basically completed this work within this year. The Fourteenth Construction Office in Nikolaev Oblast has excavated 700,000 cubic meters of soil and poured some concrete (later, we saw another construction office in Simferopol, Crimea, digging a reservoir for the city). The construction offices work all year round. The laborious work is mostly mechanized. Eighty-five percent of the earthwork done by the Sixth Construction Office is done by machines. We saw one of its rather large self-propelled excavators, which was manufactured by the Kramatorsk Factory in Ukraine, with a boom length of 40 meters and a bucket volume of 4 cubic meters. The construction offices only ask the collective farmers to help in places where the canal network is about to be completed. The main purpose is to enable the collective farmers to learn to use and manage the canals. The collective farmers provide manpower and transportation tools when helping, and they receive cash remuneration.
    Whether construction workers or collective farmers, they all look forward to and strive for the early completion of the Kakhovka water conservancy project. Because the hydroelectric power station will supply surrounding cities and industrial enterprises, it will supply more than 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to agriculture in many states. Because the reservoir will ensure that the lower reaches of the Dnieper River become a deep-water waterway. Due to the establishment of the reservoir and hydroelectric power station, 1.5 million hectares of land in southern Ukraine and northern Crimea will be irrigated, and 1.7 million hectares of land will be subjected to water conservancy.
    Before leaving New Kakhovka, we once again took a motorboat to view the construction site and the city from the river. The more we looked, the more we believed that the hydroelectric power station could be completed in 1955. The vigorous vitality and the unwavering confidence in advancing towards communism, it is overflowing in New Kakhovka and its builders.

    在新卡霍夫卡工地
    ——乌克兰访问记之八
    本报记者  李何
    东方还没有发白，第聂伯河两岸还隐在朦胧的轮廓里。我站在船头甲板上，迎面的河风吹来清鲜的气息。在朦胧中，快船彷佛走慢了，好像走在一条宽阔漫长的柏油路上。在这条黑油油的公路的尽头的左边，无数灯光成列成簇地闪耀着，似乎天上的银河落在那里。
      “什么地方？”我问船上的乘务员，虽然已经猜想到这是我们的目的地。
    乘务员操着乌克兰腔的俄语，含笑地回答说：“新卡霍夫卡。四年以前还是一片沙地，因为建筑水利工程，现在已经是一座城市了。”
    到新卡霍夫卡后，我们有机会认识了这个建筑战线的“后方”。原先以为水利工程在卡霍夫卡建筑，这时知道卡霍夫卡留在北面十公里远的地方，而工程是在新卡霍夫卡建筑。在这原来只有十来间茅屋和只种葡萄的沙地上，在一九五二年出现了新的城市。这座在地图上新出现的城市沿着第聂伯河左岸向南发展着。全市现有约五百座一至三层的房屋，居住着一万五千以上居民。市内有为居民——建筑公司的职工及其家属——服务的各种文化建筑物：七个图书馆、三个十年制学校、奥德萨水利技术学院分校、文化宫、剧院、医院等等。建立了许多像混凝土工厂、机械厂、安装厂、锯木厂等等辅助建筑的企业。铺设了一百七十多公里铁路，约六十公里公路，架设了约二百公里高压和低压电线。这些条件以及全苏联的支持，保证着建筑工程的顺利进行。
    我们请“第聂伯建筑局”的副总工程师亚历山大·彼得罗维奇·别清带领我们上工地去。“第聂伯建筑局”负责着水电站的全部工程。路上我们经过钢筋结构工厂和混凝土工厂。工地需要的钢筋结构和混凝土等等建筑材料，都是先由工厂准备好，然后运去的。这样，工程能够迅速地进行。混凝土工厂分三个部分，每部分有四个混凝土搅拌器，每个容积二千四百公升。工厂是完全机械化的，每昼夜产六千立方公尺混凝土。这种工厂在此地工程完毕以后，可以拆开运到别处。
    我们到了工地的中心地带。这里建筑工人们昼夜轮班不停地工作着。基坑上巨大的钢筋混凝土溢水堤、水电站和水闸的身躯在形成着。我们走到第聂伯河左岸岸边。在左岸全部工程完成、河水改道以后，从这里将筑一条体积约八百万立方公尺、长约一公里的土坝，和右岸联接起来。靠近岸边，三面土里围栽了一排钢桩，各处安装了许多抽水装置。就是依靠它们，抵抗着河水的渗透，保障基坑的干燥和基坑上建筑的安全进行。因为基坑比河面低十五公尺，曾经用吸泥机挖了半年，挖出了四百万立方公尺的土。
    在基坑上，和将来截断河水的土坝相衔接的，是半公里长的钢筋混凝土溢水堤。这个长堤的流线型的堤墩已经筑得很高。它们构成了二十八个各宽十二公尺的大门。将来水大时，就是经过这些孔道冲溢到下流去的。
    和这在成长中的溢水堤并列的是水电站本身。从浇灌的混凝土和构造的钢筋，已经分辨得出安装透平的位置。这里已经作好安装第一部透平的准备（我们走后，八月十七日已开始安装）。一千吨重的透平发电机的各个部件，将用起重二百五十吨的起重机安装。水电站一共将安装五部透平发电机，每部发电五万瓩。挑选在这里用的是转动子直径八公尺的轮叶可以转动的透平。
    在水电站的左边，隔着将来的土坝，一座通航水闸已经盖到半腰。水电站盖成后，透平所利用的上流与下流的水位差是十六公尺，所以只筑一个较大的水闸。
    这样，在广场似的基坑上面，矗立着三、四公里长的高大的水利建筑物。从基坑到它的下部，已经成形。它的上部露出天桥似的钢筋结构。在建筑物上面搭了二十一公尺高、一公里多长的木桥。桥上铺着轻便铁轨。许多部塔状大起重机的吊臂在忙碌着。这些在铁轨上移动的电力起重机，有可以起重四十吨的，有可以起重二十五吨的。
    工厂准备好的庞大钢骨和特制墙板由卡车运到工地来。起重机把有些重达十吨的钢骨吊到建筑物上去。工人们把它们用电焊焊接起来。有几个人坐在已经焊接好的钢筋结构上检验。检验合格了，工人们才用工厂制的墙板把钢筋结构围起来，然后浇灌混凝土。这种墙板也是用混凝土和钢筋精制的，长五公尺，宽二公尺半，厚八、九公分，外面光滑，内面可以挂在钢骨上。这种墙板在混凝土凝固时，便成为建筑物的外表，不用任何加工。
    摩托敞车在木桥上穿梭地来往着。它们把工厂准备好的混凝土载到这里来。敞车上排列四个铁桶，共装十二立方公尺混凝土。混凝土从桶底经过漏斗的管子，泻到钢骨中去。有的地方，起重机把卡车载的混凝土桶吊到高处。有的地方，自动装置在输送混凝土。
    在建筑溢水堤处，我们看到一个已经搭好钢骨、围好特制墙板和浇灌着混凝土的“块”。混凝土已灌筑到半腰。几个工人用风镐似的振动器插进混凝土去搅匀它。这个“块”体积大到七千立方公尺！在两个半到三昼夜就可以灌筑好。每班只要二十个工人工作。
    我们也乘汽艇看了右岸的工程。那里吸泥机和水力冲泥机紧张地工作着。准备筑坝的沙土已经堆积成小山。它是由吸泥机从在河心的哥萨克洲移去的。洲边停泊一部船只似的吸泥机，它的输泥管架到崖石的右岸去。它一小时能吸泥一千立方公尺，并且把泥卸到八十公尺高处。这样一部机器代替一千人的劳动。
    卡霍夫卡水电站工程共要浇灌约一百五十万立方公尺混凝土，做二千八百万到三千万立方公尺土工，安装一万八千六百吨金属结构。这样浩大的工程迅速地进展着。从浇灌第一立方公尺混凝土到现在的一年多，已经浇灌了六十多万立方公尺混凝土，做了二千多万立方公尺土工。
    这不但由于建筑工程的高度机械化，更由于建筑战线上的职工们沸腾的工作热情。
    卡霍夫卡水电站建筑的期限，按照苏联政府的规定，是从一九五一年到一九五六年。建筑职工们为了拥护苏联共产党中央九月全会的决议，自动提出了提前一年完成建筑，使得发电力总共二十五万瓩的五部发动机在一九五五年就能工作。职工们仔细研究了在组织上和技术上发挥潜在能力的办法。他们改进了机器的使用，广泛采用了特制墙板，加速了构造钢骨和安装的工作等等。以前只能浇灌一千立方公尺的混凝土“块”，而现在能浇灌七千立方公尺的。混凝土的“块”大，缝就少。这样既加快了工作进度，又提高了工作质量。去年十二月卡霍夫卡气候在露天冷到零下三十一度。但工人们浇灌的混凝土比十一月还多半倍。
    我们在工地来回观看着。到处可以见到超额地完成计划的公告和争取更高的成绩的标语。溢水堤建筑和安装管理处主任工程师瓦西里·瓦西里维奇·高尼赫告诉我们：工人们之所以能够提前完成计划，除了工作的机械化，技术的改进以外，最主要的是因为工人们以主人的态度关心工作。例如不久前浇灌混凝土的工作加快了，混凝土曾经一时供应不及，工人们都很耽心。他们趁空做了很多浇灌混凝土的准备工作。后来混凝土供应上了，大家都很高兴。
    在溢水堤前场子（那里将来是河底）上，我会见了这个堤的一个混凝土队队长伊凡·费多薛也维奇·格鲁先科。他的队有二十四个人，包括俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、摩尔达维、鞑靼五个民族。他和他的父亲在同队工作。格鲁先科今年二十九岁。他读书到七年级时就参加了卫国战争，复员后又学习了一年。四年前工程开始时他就来了，先做了土工。
    格鲁先科谈了他的一队工人们的思想和努力。他说：建设卡霍夫卡水利工程，对于发展农业很有好处。电力可以用在农业上，运河又可以克服干旱。所以工人们都想提前完成工程。他的父亲五十八岁了，不去找别的清闲工作，正是这样想的。以前工人不熟练，浇灌的混凝土的块很小。现在队里百分之七十的工人都学完混凝土工人训练班（这个训练班期限三个月，每周上课四次，每次两三小时），提高了技术。浇灌的混凝土的块也扩大了。所以全队每月都超额完成计划一两倍。工人们充分地发挥自己的积极性。混凝土不够时，他们就做准备浇灌混凝土的工作。没有事时，他们就帮助别队和别人。格鲁先科说：“造完这个水利工程，我们还要去做另外一个。”
    从札坡罗什乘轮船到新卡霍夫卡的路途上，我们注意到了两岸没有什么树木。到新卡霍夫卡以后知道，在水利工程建成时，那里要被淹没，所以把树木先砍掉了。将来的卡霍夫卡水库长二百五十公里，宽五到二十公里，容水一百九十亿立方公尺，从第聂伯水电站到卡霍夫卡水电站的水位都将提高。
    沿着这两百五十公里长的两岸，集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、饲畜场、石油库、码头都在很好地迁移着。我们到了第聂伯河左岸的“小卡霍夫卡”村的旧地和新居。它的旧地将被淹没，那里房屋都拆掉了。在政府帮助下，村民在新地方已经盖了二百多所石头住宅和公共建筑物、商店、农艺馆；建筑着几所学校和俱乐部；安置了饲畜场、作坊和仓库。新居比旧地漂亮多了。
    在灌溉系统的第六建筑处，我们了解了灌溉工程进行的情况。这个建筑处负责挖掘卡霍夫卡附近的水渠网。现在已有七、八个建筑处。今年以内还要建立几个建筑处。这些建筑处受乌克兰水利建筑局领导，与建筑水电站的第聂伯建筑局没有直属关系。在札坡罗什州的第五建筑处已经开好一半水渠，将于今年完成全部工作。它也在水库岸边的几个地点构筑防水土堰，这有时比迁移村庄更有利。在赫尔逊州的第十三建筑处已经掘了五十万立方公尺土。他们把在赫尔逊州内的第聂伯河支流莫古列茨小河掘深，在今年内基本上完成这个工作。在尼古拉也夫州的第十四建筑处已经掘了七十万立方公尺土，浇灌了一些混凝土（后来我们在克里米亚的辛费罗波尔看到另一建筑处在掘蓄水池，供这个城市用）。各个建筑处是整年工作的。费力工作大部分是机械化的。第六建筑处所做的土工，百分之八十五使用机器。我们看到它的一部颇大的自动行走的掘土机，那是乌克兰克拉马托尔斯克工厂制造的，它的吊臂长四十公尺，掘斗的容积四个立方公尺。各个建筑处在水渠网将要完工的地方才请集体农民帮助。主要目的在于使集体农民学会使用和管理水渠。集体农民在帮助时出人力和交通工具，得到现金报酬。
    无论建筑工人，无论集体农民，都盼望和争取卡霍夫卡水利工程的提早完成。因为水电站将供给周围许多城市和工业企业，将供给许多州的农业以十二亿瓩时以上的电力。因为水库将保证第聂伯河下游成为深水的航道。由于建立水库和水电站，乌克兰南部和克里米亚北部将有一百五十万公顷土地受到灌溉，将有一百七十万公顷土地受到水利。
    在离开新卡霍夫卡之前，我们再一次乘着汽艇从河上观看工地和城市。愈看愈相信：水电站一定可以在一九五五年建成。勃勃的生气，向共产主义前进的坚定不移的信心，它洋溢在新卡霍夫卡及其建筑者们的身上。
