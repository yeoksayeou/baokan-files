    Why I Caused a Serious Accident at the Factory
  　Worker, Nanjing Light Bulb Factory, Wu Chuanjing
    I am a worker at the state-owned Nanjing Light Bulb Factory. In April of this year, due to my violation of labor discipline and irresponsibility in my work, 1,360 projector bulbs were rendered useless, causing the biggest accident in the factory in five years. The state property suffered huge losses, and the hard work of many workers was wasted by me.
    I started working in the hydrogen gas room of the light bulb factory two years ago. The hydrogen gas room is an important department for the entire factory's production. The filaments of various light bulbs must be burned here. If the filaments are not burned well, it will affect the lifespan of the light bulbs. Initially, I was serious about the hydrogen burning work, staying by the furnace all day long. Although the product quality was unstable at that time, and there were often defective products, it was much better than before. The leaders and comrades praised me, and I was very happy, so complacency slowly grew. After that, I rarely consulted with the foreman on big or small problems. If the workshop director didn't look for me, I wouldn't go to him either. Gradually, I became less enthusiastic about my work. I thought, "To be a person, one should be an extraordinary person. It's boring to always do this simple work. I want people inside and outside the factory to know that Wu Chuanjing is capable and competent." After the nationwide technical innovation movement was launched, I became even less interested in my assigned job and only wanted to make a big invention that would shake the entire factory.
    I usually liked to tinker with projectors and radios, and I also became familiar with the principles of projecting movies. I served as an amateur projectionist in the factory and often took time to help others repair radios and things like that. Therefore, some people praised me when they saw me: "Little Wu is so smart." I didn't say it out loud, but I was very happy inside. Later, when the leadership sent two apprentices, I slowly handed over the work to the apprentices. When working, I didn't use a thermometer to check the furnace temperature as I should have, and I didn't fill out the temperature record sheet. Sometimes I just turned my back and glanced at it with my eyes. I gave up my assigned job and wanted to find inventions everywhere. When I heard that "there are problems in the winding room" and "the generator also has minor problems," I was very concerned and wanted to study them. At this time, I decided to simply conduct "principle leadership" over the hydrogen burning work and bury myself in "Electrical Engineering." In the past two years, I have finished reading several professional books on electrical engineering, chemical engineering, and physics. One moment I wanted to solve the power-on problem in the winding room, and another moment I wanted to make a relay on the generator. Sometimes I watched them renovate generators and motors in the electrical workshop during work hours, sometimes I learned to turn parts in the public vehicle workshop, and sometimes I even ran to Nanjing Institute of Technology to discuss with classmates and teaching assistants, rarely at my own post. The apprentices had a lot of opinions when they saw that my labor discipline was so lax. When the administration had urgent matters, they couldn't find me anywhere by phone. The workshop director was very unhappy and talked to me once:
    "You're never in the workshop, where have you been going?" I replied with a straight face:
    "I go to other workshops to take a look and study something that will benefit the factory."
      "What about your assigned job?"
    "There's no need to guard the hydrogen burning work all day long. I only let the apprentices do it when I'm confident."
    The leadership's concern made me very angry. In fact, the furnace temperature in the hydrogen gas room was often unstable at that time, but I was wholeheartedly "studying" the generator; I never thought about studying and improving the hydrogen gas room's problems. My ideological problems had been criticized within the Youth League, but after the criticism, I didn't make any improvements.
    In April of this year, a batch of projector bulbs came. Although the technician repeatedly told me: "This batch of bulbs has special performance, so pay more attention." But I still didn't pay attention. I only looked at the temperature of the first furnace, and then I still followed the old practice, handing it over to the apprentices to burn, while I buried myself in researching the generator. As a result, I didn't master the furnace temperature well, the hydrogen wasn't burned properly, and a big problem occurred.
    When the defective products were discovered in the initial stage, I didn't believe that the defective product accident was related to me, and I refused to admit that it was my mistake. I didn't accept the criticism from the Party branch secretary, and some workers criticized me, saying: "The factory is a tightly organized whole, and you can't do things according to your interests. Why are you running around during work hours?" I still didn't care when I heard it. Later, the Youth League group leader, Liu Yuying, said to me: "Everyone reflects that the reason for the defective products may be insufficient hydrogen burning temperature." I felt half cold inside when I heard it. Later, after laboratory testing and inspection, it was confirmed from all aspects that the problem was indeed with me, and I became discouraged. Just when I was at a dead end, the Party branch secretary and the Youth League branch secretary talked to me kindly, saying: "The leadership wants to find a way to solve the long-term defective product problem in the factory, but the responsibility is unclear. Everyone pushes it to be a problem of the whole factory, and it is difficult to find the key reason for the defective products to be eliminated. You should abandon personal gains and losses, proceed from the interests of the country, humbly accept this lesson, and work hard to improve your work. Everyone will never look down on you." Later, several Youth League group meetings were held, and the apprentice Liu Yuying first said: As long as I recognize and correct my mistakes, I will still learn technology from me in the future, and I will never despise me. Really, when I walked into the studio, the apprentices respected me as they used to, and they consulted with me on how to deal with problems. Other comrades also treated me with a comrade attitude.
    One day, I walked past the finished product inspection department, and took a few to test from a large pile of defective bulbs. As a result, none of them were good, and I felt extremely sad. It just so happened that the Soviet color film "Road to Life" was being screened in various cinemas in Nanjing these days, and many comrades enthusiastically advised me to watch it. I finished watching this movie in the workers' cinema. On the way back to the factory, the image of Marusya was always reflected in my eyes. On the way out, I saw the brightly lit railway station from a distance. The light from the locomotive coming from afar was so bright that people couldn't open their eyes. I stared at it in a daze and thought of the defective light bulbs, and couldn't help but shudder. I thought: If the bad bulbs I made were used on this train, and the light bulb suddenly broke in the middle of the journey, not only would the train be delayed on a dark night, and the passengers and materials could not be delivered to their destination on schedule, but there would also be a risk of derailment. I also thought of Marusya, she was indeed a brave and smart young person, but when she wanted to show off her personal strength and ski down from a high place alone, she immediately fell; when she wanted to chase the quantity and operate two machine tools alone, she damaged the machine tools. Marusya is really a mirror of me.
    Soon, I heard someone in the factory director's office say: "Because we produced a batch of defective projection bulbs in April, we did not complete the national plan, which affected the completion of the sales task of the China Film Equipment Company. Because Nanjing Film Machinery Factory did not receive the 30V400W projection bulbs, film projectors could not be sold either." The factory director also talked about this matter at the general meeting of all employees, and it is still deeply remembered in my heart. I often think this way: Industrial production is indeed an interconnected and inseparable whole. If a factory or an individual fails to complete the national plan, especially the quality indicators, it will directly affect other factories. From here, I realized that hydrogen burning work is very important and an indispensable part of socialist construction. Workers in every job position in our factory must have collectivist thinking and strict organizational discipline, and must have a strict attitude of labor that abides by operating procedures, in order to ensure the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the rapid completion of our socialist construction.
    Soon, I posted a photo of Marusya on the wall in front of my desk. Some workers curiously asked me: "What's going on?" I said: "This is a mirror, I must be like Marusya, starting from scratch from today." Indeed, when I put aside all my personal plans and focused on hydrogen burning work, I saw that the work was improving and I was also progressing. In the past, the problem of the furnace stopper explosion has not been solved. After studying with the apprentices, we discovered that it was due to the atmospheric pressure. As long as the rubber stopper is slowly plugged in after the filament is taken out, and the pressure in the furnace is slowly released, the explosion event of the rubber stopper will not occur.
    Now, our work has started anew, and the set of systems that was established in the past is now being implemented. For example, the system of asking for instructions and reporting to the foreman, the shift handover system, and the filling of daily production reports and temperature record sheets, we all strictly implement. The filaments sent every day have hydrogen burning specifications as usual. In the past, we did not fill in according to the actual burning temperature, nor did we use a thermometer to measure the temperature, so we could not find the reason for the accident. Now we use a thermometer to control the furnace temperature for each type of bulb, and fill in as much temperature as we actually burn. This not only makes the work more organized, but also allows us to grasp the furnace temperature more stably. Before leaving get off work every day, we explain the work clearly. I have re-accustomed myself to this strict, organized and disciplined factory life. Of course, my progress is only the beginning, but I am determined, under the education of the Party, to rely on collective strength, resolutely draw a clear line with my non-proletarian thoughts, and settle down to my assigned job, and do my part in the cause of building socialism.

    我为什么给工厂造成了严重事故
  　国营南京灯泡厂工人  吴传经
    我是国营南京灯泡厂的工人，今年四月份，我由于违反劳动纪律，工作不负责任，使一千三百六十只放映泡全部成了废品，造成了全厂五年来的最大事故，国家财产遭受了巨大损失，许多工人的劳动心血被我浪费了。
    我在两年前到灯泡厂氢气间工作。氢气间是全厂生产的重要部门，各种灯泡中的灯丝，都要拿到这里来烧过，假若灯丝烧得不好，就会影响灯泡的寿命。最初我对烧氢工作还是认真的，整天守住炉子不离身。当时产品质量虽然不稳，废品也常有，但比过去是好得多了。领导上和同志们都称道，我也很乐意，自满情绪就慢慢地滋长起来了。我以后碰到大小问题都很少和工长商量，车间主任不找我，我也不去找他。慢慢地对工作也不热心了，我想：“做一个人应该做个不平凡的人，老是做这件简单的工作多没意思，我要使厂内厂外的人晓得我吴传经有本事有能力。”全国开展技术革新运动后，我对本位工作更加不感兴趣，一心想搞震动全厂的大发明。
    我平时很欢喜搞搞放映机、收音机，还摸熟了放映电影的道理，在厂里担任了业余放映员，经常抽空帮别人修理收音机之类的东西。因此，有人见了我就称赞：“小吴真聪明。”我嘴上不说，心里却十分高兴。以后领导上派来了两个学徒，我就慢慢的把工作交给学徒去做，工作时该用测温仪看炉温也不看，温度记录表也不填，有时只是背转身用眼睛瞟瞟。我放弃了本位工作，到处想找发明创造。当我听说：“绕丝间有问题”，“发电机也有小毛病”，就十分关心，想去研究研究。这时，我下决心对烧氢工作干脆进行“原则领导”，自己埋头在“电工学”上面。两年来，我看完了好几本电工、化工、物理学的专业书籍。我一会儿想解决绕丝间的通电问题，一会儿又想在发电机上面做个继电器。上班时有时在电工房看他们装修发电机和马达，有时在公用车间学着车零件，有时还跑到南京工学院去和同学、助教们商量，很少在自己的岗位上。学徒看到我劳动纪律这样松懈，很有意见，行政上有紧要事到处打电话也找不到我，车间主任很不高兴，找我谈了一次话：
    “你老不在车间，到底到那里去了呢？”我理直气壮地回答：
    “到别的车间去看看，钻研点东西对工厂是有好处的。”
      “那你的本位工作呢？”
    “烧氢工作根本不用整日死守，我有把握才放手让学徒搞的。”
    领导上的关心使我十分恼火，其实当时氢气间炉温经常不稳，而我却在一心“钻研”发电机；氢气间的问题，从没想去研究改进。我的思想毛病曾受到过青年团内的批评，批评之后，我也没有什么改进。
    今年四月，来了一批放映泡，虽然技术员一再关照我：“这批灯泡性能特殊，要多加注意。”但我仍不重视，只看了第一炉的温度，以后仍按旧例，交给学徒去烧，自己还是埋头钻研发电机。结果没有掌握好炉温，烧氢没烧到家，出了大毛病。
    当发现废品的初期，我不相信废品事故与我有关，死也不肯承认是我的错误。党支部书记的批评我不接受，有的工人批评我说：“工厂是一个有严密组织的整体，不能凭你兴趣办事，你上班时为什么乱跑？”我听了仍不在乎。后来，团小组长刘瑀瑛对我说：“大家反映，出废品的原因可能是烧氢温度不足。”我听了心里才冷了一半。后来经过化验检查，从各方面证实毛病确实出在我身上，我灰心丧气了。正在我走头无路的时候，党支部书记和团支部书记亲切地和我谈话，说：“领导上要想法解决厂里长期存在的废品问题，可是责任不明，大家推说是全厂的问题，找不出关键原因在什么地方，废品就很难消灭。你应该抛弃个人得失，从国家利益出发，虚心接受这一教训，努力改进工作，大家决不会看不起你的。”以后，又召开了几次团小组会，学徒刘瑀瑛首先表示：只要我认识和改正错误，今后还向我学技术，决不轻视我。真的，当我走进工作室时，学徒还像过去一样地尊重我，处理问题都和我商量，其他同志们也都以同志的态度对待我。
    有一天，我走过成品检验科，在一大堆废泡中间拿几个试了一下，结果没有一个好的，心里难过极了。刚巧那几天南京各电影院都在放映苏联彩色影片“走向生活”，很多同志都热心地劝我去看一下。我在工人电影院看完了这部电影，回厂的路上，玛露霞的形象一直映在我的眼前。一路出来，远远望见火车站灯光明亮，从远处开来的火车头上的灯光，照得人不能睁眼，我出神地看着，想起了废灯泡的事，不禁打了一个寒噤，我想：要是我造的坏泡子用在这辆火车上，火车开到中途突然灯泡坏了，在黑暗的夜晚不仅火车脱班，不能把旅客、物资按期送到目的地，而且有出轨的危险。我又想到玛露霞，她确实是一个勇敢聪明的青年，而当她要个人逞强，要一个人从高处滑雪下去时，立刻就摔倒了；当她想赶数量一个人开两台机床时，把机床都损坏了。玛露霞真是我的一面镜子。
    不久，我在厂长室听到有人说：“由于我们四月份出了一批废放映泡，没有完成国家计划，影响了中国电影器材公司销售任务的完成，南京电影机械厂因为没有拨到30V400W放映泡，电影放映机也无法出售。”这件事厂长在全体职工大会上也谈到过，直到现在还深深地记在我的心上。我常常这样想：工业生产确实是一个互相联系不可分割的整体，如果一个厂一个人完不成国家计划，特别是质量指标，就会直接影响别的工厂。从这里我才认识到烧氢工作是十分重要的，也是社会主义建设不可分割的一部分。我们工厂里每一个工作岗位上的工人，都一定要具有集体主义思想和严格的组织性纪律性，要有严格遵守操作规程的劳动态度，才能保证劳动生产率的不断提高，我们的社会主义建设才能迅速完成。
    不久，我就在书桌前面的墙上贴了一张玛露霞的照片。有些工人好奇地问我：“这是怎么回事？”我说：“这是一面镜子，我一定要像玛露霞一样，从今天开始从头做起。”确实，在工作时我看到这张照片就想到几个月来的一切，它有一股力量，督促我努力前进。几个月来，当我放下了个人的一切打算，安心在烧氢工作上用工夫时，我看到了工作在好转，自己也在进步。过去炉塞爆炸问题一直没有解决，我和学徒们研究后，才发现是大气压力的关系，只要在取出灯丝后把橡皮塞子慢慢塞上，让炉内压力慢慢冲出来，就不会有炸掉橡皮塞子的爆炸事件发生了。
    现在，我们的工作是从新开始了，过去所建立的一套制度现在才被执行了。如向工长的请示汇报制，交接班制，填写生产日报表和温度记录表等，我们都严格执行了。每天送来的灯丝照例都有烧氢规范，过去我们不按实际烧温情况填写，也不用测温仪测温，因此发生了事故也找不到原因。现在我们烧每一种炉泡都用测温仪掌握炉温，实际烧多少温度就填多少，这样不但使工作更有条理，而且也可以更稳地掌握炉温。每天下班前，都把工作交代清楚。我重新习惯了这种严格的有组织有纪律的工厂生活。当然，我的进步还只是开始，但我有决心在党的教育下，依靠集体力量，坚决和我的非无产阶级思想划清界限，安心本位工作，在建设社会主义的事业中尽我的一份力量。
