Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: US military authorities are using Japanese ships to conduct espionage activities off the coast of China, collecting military intelligence for the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    According to sources close to the Japan Maritime Safety Agency on the 3rd, at the request of the US Far East Naval and Air Force Command stationed in Japan, the patrol ships of the Japan Maritime Safety Agency operating in the East China Sea have two "important tasks": to carry out so-called anti-submarine activities and to listen to China's military code telegrams. They said that when Japanese patrol ships equipped with radar obtain intelligence, they immediately telegraph the situation to the US Air Force authorities through the Maritime Safety Agency headquarters, and the US Air Force will dispatch according to the intelligence. At the same time, Japanese patrol ships also sail near the coast of mainland China to intercept China's military telegrams and bring the telegrams back to Japan. These sources said that these Chinese military code telegrams are handed over to the US Far East Naval authorities, and the US military authorities distribute the intelligence collected by the Japanese patrol ships to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. These sources also pointed out that although it is no longer the fishing season, and there are few Japanese fishing boats fishing in the East China Sea, a certain number of Japanese patrol ships are still active in the East China Sea. They also revealed that the Maritime Safety Agency is also planning to establish its own agency to translate Chinese code intelligence.

    Prior to this, the Japanese "Akahata" revealed on September 28 that the US Far East military authorities were using Japanese ships to reconnoiter the movements of the Chinese Navy in the Taiwan Strait off the central coast of China. "Akahata" said that sailors on Japanese fishing boats that recently returned to Nagasaki said that their ships had radar equipment and had stayed at sea for two consecutive months observing Chinese maritime activities, even in areas outside of possible fishing grounds.

    美军事当局利用日本船只在我国沿海进行间谍活动
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：美国军事当局正在利用日本船只在中国沿海进行间谍活动，为美国和蒋介石卖国集团收集军事情报。
    据接近日本海上保安厅的人士三日透露，在驻日本美国远东海军和空军司令部的要求下，在东中国海活动的日本海上保安厅的巡逻船只负有两项
  “重要任务”，就是进行所谓反潜水艇活动和收听中国的军事密码电报。他们说，装备着雷达的日本巡逻船在获得情报时，立即通过海上保安厅总部把情况电告美国空军当局，美国空军就会根据情报出动。同时，日本巡逻船只还驶到中国大陆沿海附近窃收中国的军事电报，并把电报带到日本。这些人士说，这些中国的军事密码电报都交给美国远东海军当局，美军当局并把日本巡逻船只收集到的情报分送给蒋匪帮。这些人士还指出，虽然现在已经不是捕鱼季节，在中国东海捕鱼的日本渔船已经为数不多，但是一定数量的日本巡逻船只仍在中国东海进行活动。他们还透露，海上保安厅也在计划设立它自己的机构来翻译中国的密码情报。
    在这以前，日本“赤旗报”曾在九月二十八日揭露远东美军当局利用日本船只在中国中部沿海侦察中国海军在台湾海峡的动静。“赤旗报”说，最近回到长崎的日本渔船的水手说，他们的船有雷达设备，曾留在海上连续两个月观察中国的海上活动，即使这些地区是在可能的捕鱼区之外的。
