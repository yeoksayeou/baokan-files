Tianjin held a conference of representatives of traditional Chinese medicine in mid-October. The conference reviewed and summarized the work of traditional Chinese medicine in Tianjin over the past five years, and discussed the issue of strengthening the work of traditional Chinese medicine and sorting out and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine in the future.

The conference, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, criticized the deviations and mistakes of the health administration departments at all levels in Tianjin and other relevant departments in the past in implementing the policy of "uniting Chinese and Western medicine," such as underestimating, discriminating against, and even excluding traditional Chinese medicine.

The conference fully exchanged views on how to strengthen the work of traditional Chinese medicine, and believed that: it is necessary to educate health administrative cadres and medical staff in health departments at all levels to make them realize the importance of strengthening the work of traditional Chinese medicine and earnestly sorting out and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and thoroughly criticize the erroneous idea of underestimating and negating the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, so as to earnestly implement the policy of "uniting Chinese and Western medicine" and carry forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.

The conference decided to mobilize and organize the medical community in Tianjin to actively participate in the work of sorting out and researching traditional Chinese medicine, and suggested that the government establish a Tianjin Chinese Medical Science Research Committee to uniformly guide academic research of traditional Chinese medicine and collect various effective prescriptions; expand the business of traditional Chinese medicine, and assist joint clinics of traditional Chinese medicine to establish joint diagnosis and technical cooperation relations with various hospitals; establish a municipal experimental hospital of traditional Chinese medicine on the basis of the existing municipal outpatient department of traditional Chinese medicine, as a center for clinical research of traditional Chinese medicine in Tianjin; in the future, gradually absorb traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in work in hospitals and medical stations with appropriate conditions; improve the training school of traditional Chinese medicine and appropriately increase academic courses of traditional Chinese medicine; create conditions in other medical education institutions to gradually add teaching content about traditional Chinese medicine; and health administrative departments at all levels will gradually absorb traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in work. The conference also pointed out that Tianjin is one of the distribution centers of Chinese herbal medicine in North China. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the research and management of Chinese herbal medicine, the existing problems in transportation and sales should be gradually resolved.

The conference emphasized that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and Western medicine practitioners in the city must unite closely, work together with one heart, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and work together to sort out and carry forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine and establish true Chinese medicine.

The conference finally adopted the resolution on correctly implementing the Party and the People's Government's policy towards traditional Chinese medicine and a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao.

    天津市在十月中旬举行了中医代表会议。会议检查和总结了天津市五年来中医工作，并讨论了今后加强中医工作，整理发扬祖国医学遗产问题。
    会议以批评和自我批评的精神，批判了天津市各级卫生行政部门及其他有关部门过去在执行“团结中西医”的政策上，轻视、歧视甚至排斥中医的偏差和错误。
    会议对于如何加强中医工作充分交换了意见，认为：必须在各级卫生部门中，对卫生行政干部和医务人员进行教育，使他们认识到加强中医工作，认真整理和发扬祖国医学遗产的重要意义，彻底批判轻视和否定祖国医学遗产的错误思想，以求能够认真贯彻“团结中西医”政策，发扬祖国医学遗产。
    会议决定：动员和组织天津市医务界积极参加祖国医学的整理和研究工作，并建议政府成立天津市中国医学科学研究委员会，统一指导中医学术研究工作，多方搜集各种良方效方；扩大中医业务，协助中医联合诊所同各医院建立联诊和技术合作关系；在现有的市立中医门诊部的基础上成立市立中医实验医院，作为天津市中医学术临床研究的中心；今后陆续在有条件的医院和医疗站中，分别吸收中医参加工作；改进中医进修学校，适当增加中医学术课程；在其他医学教育机构，创造条件逐步增添关于祖国医学的教学内容；各级卫生行政部门将逐步吸收中医参加工作。会议并指出：天津是华北中药的集散地之一，因此，除应加强中药研究和管理工作外，并应逐步解决目前运、销中存在的问题。
    会议强调指出：全市中、西医必须紧密团结，同心协力，相互学习，取长补短，共同为整理发扬祖国医学遗产，建立真正的中国医学而进行不懈的努力。
