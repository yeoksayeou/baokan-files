    Suburban Beijing Vegetable Farmers Produce Large Quantities of Vegetables to Supply City Residents
    The quick-maturing vegetables planted by farmers in the suburbs of Beijing in late August have been put on the market in large quantities, and early autumn vegetables are also being harvested successively. The market supply situation has gradually returned to normal. At present, the daily supply of vegetables in the ten vegetable markets has reached 1.6 to 1.7 million catties, which can basically meet the needs of the urban people in terms of quantity.
    In order to ensure the supply of vegetables to the people of the capital, vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have actively expanded the production of autumn vegetables. In the early stage of autumn vegetable sowing, vegetable fields in many areas were destroyed by rainstorms or submerged by standing water. The vegetable farmers drained the water and replanted in time. In some low-lying areas, the accumulated water was drained later, and the season for planting Chinese cabbage had passed. The vegetable farmers seized the opportunity and rushed to plant spinach and rapeseed. Therefore, the planting area of ​​autumn vegetables this year has finally expanded to nearly 86,000 mu, an increase of 14,000 mu over last year.
    At present, vegetable farmers in the suburban vegetable areas are actively eliminating diseases and insect pests, topdressing and watering, and striving for a bumper harvest of autumn vegetables. It is estimated that about 400 million catties of vegetables can be harvested, which is enough for the consumption of more than 3 million people in the capital this winter and next spring.
    With the improvement of people's material lives and the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the equipment for producing winter fine vegetables has also expanded rapidly. The number of greenhouses has expanded to more than 7,700, which is 38 times that before liberation. More than 16,000 new solar greenhouses have been opened this year, an expansion of 52 percent over last year. (Zhu Zunhuang)

    北京郊区菜农生产大量蔬菜供应市民
    北京郊区农民在八月下旬抢种的快熟蔬菜已大量上市，早秋蔬菜也陆续收获，市场供应情况已逐渐恢复正常。目前，十个菜市每日蔬菜上市量达到一百六七十万斤，在数量上大体可以满足城市人民的需要。
    为了保证对首都人民的蔬菜供应，北京市郊区菜农积极扩大了秋菜的生产。在秋菜播种的初期，有许多地区的菜地被暴雨冲毁或为积水淹没，菜农们及时排水补种；有些低洼地区，积水排除得较晚，栽种大白菜的季节已过，菜农们又抓紧时机，抢种了菠菜和油菜。因此，今年的秋菜播种面积，终于扩大到近八万六千亩，比去年增加了一万四千亩。
    目前，市郊菜区菜农们正积极除治病虫，追肥浇水，争取秋菜丰收。预计可收获四亿斤左右的蔬菜，足够首都三百多万人民今冬明春的食用。
    随着人民物质生活的改善和农业合作化运动的发展，生产冬季细菜的设备也迅速扩大。温室已扩大到七千七百多间，相当解放前的三十八倍。今年新辟的阳畦，就有一万六千多个，比去年扩大了百分之五十二。　（祝遵璜）
