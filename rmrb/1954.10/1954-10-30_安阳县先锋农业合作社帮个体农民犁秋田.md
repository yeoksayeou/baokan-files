    Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Anyang County Helps Individual Farmers Plow Autumn Fields
    The Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anyang County, Henan Province, is helping farmers outside the cooperative to plow their autumn fields, ensuring that all one thousand mu of wheat in the village are sown in a timely manner.
    This cooperative has achieved excellent production results this year, expanding from the original 144 households to 222 households before this autumn. Through political and ideological education and the consolidation of labor organization during the cooperative's expansion, the socialist consciousness of the members has been further enhanced, and the production order has also improved. Seeing that more than thirty households of mutual aid team members and individual farmers outside the cooperative were unable to sow more than one hundred mu of wheat in a timely manner due to insufficient livestock and labor, the cooperative helped them while plowing their own autumn fields. He Cun'gui, a middle peasant, had concerns about taking the socialist road, fearing losses if he joined the cooperative. He sold his livestock last year. Now, he was worried about his more than ten mu of unplowed autumn fields. The cooperative members took the initiative to help him plow the land, and the quality of the plowing was also very good, allowing him to sow in a timely manner. He went to the field and saw that his wheat seedlings were growing very neatly. He said with great emotion, "The thinking of the cooperative members is indeed stronger than ours."

    安阳县先锋农业合作社帮个体农民犁秋田
    河南安阳县先锋农业生产合作社帮助社外农民翻犁秋田，使全村一千亩小麦适时播种。
    这个社今年的生产成绩很好，今年秋前便从原来的一百四十四户扩大到二百二十二户。经过扩社当中的政治思想教育和整顿劳动组织，社员们的社会主义觉悟更提高了，生产秩序也进了一步。社里见到社外三十几户互助组员和单干农民，因牲畜和劳力不足，有一百多亩小麦不能适时下种，便在社里翻犁秋田的同时去帮助他们。中农贺存贵对走社会主义道路有顾虑，怕入社吃亏，去年就卖了牲口，现在，他望着自己那未犁的十几亩秋田发愁了，合作社社员们便主动地去帮他犁地，犁的质量也很好，使他适时下了种。他下地看了自己的麦苗出得很整齐，很感动地说：“人家社员的思想就是比咱强。”
