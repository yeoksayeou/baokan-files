    On the German question and the issue of European security, a struggle between two lines is unfolding. On the one hand, the Soviet Union is making unwavering efforts to strive for a peaceful resolution of the German question and the establishment of a European collective security system. On the other hand, the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries are stepping up their plans to revive German militarism and establish a new military bloc in Europe. On October 23, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, suggesting that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries—France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union—be held in November of this year to discuss the restoration of Germany's unification on a peaceful and democratic basis, the holding of free all-German elections, the withdrawal of the four countries' occupation forces from the territories of East and West Germany, and the convening of an all-European conference to prepare for the establishment of a European collective security system. On the same day, the foreign ministers of the Western countries signed a series of agreements in Paris aimed at realizing the rearmament of West Germany and piecing together a military bloc. This development of the current situation has a significant bearing on the fate of Germany and the future of Europe. Therefore, it cannot but arouse the close attention and serious vigilance of the people of Europe and all peace-loving people in the world.
    The four foreign ministers' conference held in Berlin in January of this year failed to reach an agreement on the German question and the issue of European security due to the obstruction of the three Western countries, but these issues have not been removed from the agenda. Since the end of the Berlin conference, the Soviet Union has repeatedly made suggestions to the French, British, and American governments in order to strive for the resolution of these issues, advocating the convening of an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system and the convening of a four foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German question and other issues. It is very clear that if the three Western countries give due importance and consideration to these suggestions, the countries concerned will be able to make progress in resolving the German question and the issue of European security. The bankruptcy of the "European Defense Community" treaty has further increased the favorable conditions for resolving these issues. However, the Western countries, disregarding the Soviet Union's suggestions, continue to pursue new plans to remilitarize West Germany. In this situation, the Soviet government, based on its position of expediting the resolution of the German question to consolidate European peace and security, made another constructive effort in the note of October 23 to open the way for the peaceful resolution of the German question and the establishment of a European collective security system. This action of the Soviet Union to strive for peace and the policy currently followed by France, Britain, the United States, and other Western countries to deepen the division of Germany and Europe are in stark contrast.
    Whether from the national interests of the German people or from the security interests of European countries, the resolution of the German question cannot be delayed any longer. The Soviet government pointed out in its note of October 23: "The most important and urgent task is to restore Germany's unification, making it a peaceful and democratic country, and to conclude a peace treaty with it." In order to restore Germany's unification, it is necessary to hold free all-German elections so that the German people can express their free will. The Soviet government expressed its willingness to re-examine the suggestions on holding all-German elections put forward by Britain and supported by France and the United States at the Berlin conference, as long as the corresponding suggestions put forward by the Soviet Union are also studied at the same time. This attitude of the Soviet Union in actively seeking consultation fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's sincerity in peacefully resolving the German question. However, the agreements passed by the Western countries at the London and Paris conferences allow West Germany to establish an army of 500,000 people, and West Germany's heavy industry will also resume large-scale production of munitions. The result of openly promoting this policy of reviving German militarism will inevitably be to turn West Germany into a hotbed of new wars in Europe, and it will allow West Germany's revanchist forces to carry out their aggressive policies in Europe without restraint.
    In order to promote the resolution of the German question, the Soviet government has consistently tried to create conditions for the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany. As early as March of this year, the Soviet government announced the establishment of relations with the German Democratic Republic in the same way as with other sovereign countries, and the German Democratic Republic has full power to negotiate with West Germany. The Soviet government suggested at the Berlin conference that the governments of France, Britain, and the United States discuss the withdrawal of occupation forces from the eastern and western parts of Germany, and now suggests withdrawing the occupation forces without delay. It is very clear that this decision will have a great effect on restoring Germany's unification and consolidating European peace. However, the London and Paris agreements of the Western countries unilaterally stipulate that the occupation forces of the United States, Britain, and France will continue to be stationed in West Germany for 50 years, and the number of occupation forces can be increased at any time. This means that West Germany will not be able to escape the fate of being occupied by foreign troops and colonized for half a century. The United States, Britain, and France shamelessly say that this is restoring West Germany's "sovereignty" and "ending the occupation system in West Germany." Anyone can see that West Germany is so constrained that it will make it impossible to restore Germany's unification for a long time.
    The Soviet Union has consistently advocated that in order to ensure European security, a pan-European collective security system must be established, rather than an aggressive military bloc. The draft pan-European treaty proposed by the Soviet Union long ago contains real guarantees for the security of France and Poland, Britain and the Soviet Union, and all European countries, large and small. At the same time, it creates favorable conditions for the re-establishment of Germany's national unification and for Germany's free and peaceful development. The Soviet Union now reiterates the proposal for the four foreign ministers to discuss convening a pan-European conference to prepare for the establishment of a pan-European collective security system, which is fully in line with the common aspirations of the people of European countries and the interests of consolidating European peace. However, after the collapse of the "European Defense Community" plan, the Western countries pieced together a new military bloc with West Germany participating, including Britain—the Western European Union—and further pulled West Germany into the North Atlantic Group. This will inevitably create opposition between European countries and aggravate international tensions.
    The Western countries' plan to rearm West Germany is in direct conflict with the discussions on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons currently underway in the United Nations. As everyone knows, the opinions between the Soviet Union and the Western countries on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons have become closer. The Soviet Union not only suggested taking the proposals of France and the United States on this issue as a basis, but also put forward a joint proposal with Canada, France, the United States, and Britain in the United Nations. This progress on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons is conducive to easing international tensions. However, it is impossible to suggest universal disarmament on the one hand and implement West German remilitarization on the other. These two behaviors are incompatible. This approach by Western countries will only contribute to the deterioration of the international situation.
    It is very clear that the situation currently formed is: either the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States, which bear special responsibility for resolving the German question, make every effort to review and resolve the issue of restoring Germany's unification, in order to realize the aspirations of the German people and consolidate European peace; or things develop to the revival of German militarism and West Germany's joining an aggressive military bloc, so that Germany will be divided for a long time, and a remilitarized West Germany will become a direct threat to European peace. It can be seen from this that the suggestions put forward by the Soviet government in its note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on October 23 have a very urgent and important significance. The peace-loving people of all countries warmly express their support and endorsement of the Soviet Union's suggestions.
    However, the American aggressive bloc and its followers are very panicked about this sincere effort of the Soviet Union to seek peace. They fear that the influence of the Soviet Union's suggestions will cause their new plan to revive German militarism to suffer the same fate as the "European Defense Community." Therefore, they try their best to distort that the Soviet Union's suggestions do not include "new things" in order to reduce its importance, and they claim that they will not hold negotiations with the Soviet Union until their London and Paris agreements are ratified. US President Eisenhower said on October 25: "The new European unity may become the basis for negotiations with the Russians, a basis that does not exist now." British Prime Minister Churchill also publicly stated on October 26: "At this stage when the agreements reached in Western Europe are still awaiting ratification, I do not think the time is ripe for a four-power conference." These remarks by the seekers of "power politics" show that they will do everything possible to promote the policy of preparing for a new war in Europe.
    But people know that countless facts have long proved that in the current situation where the forces defending peace are growing stronger, pursuing the "power politics" of preparing for war and blackmailing peace-loving countries will never have good results. Western European countries that follow the United States, especially France, will incur serious consequences if they accept such a policy. By doing so, they will inevitably face the threat of aggression from German militarism again, and they will stand against peace-loving countries. The responsibility for causing this damage to the interests and security of their own nation lies with the current governments of these countries themselves.
    The eyes of the peace-loving people of all countries, especially the people of European countries, are bright, and they have clearly seen the evil essence of the US and its partners' plan to revive German militarism. The public in Western European countries, including a wide range of people in France and West Germany, have called for negotiations with the Soviet Union to seek collective peace in Europe. This universal call from the public of all countries cannot be ignored.
    The Soviet Union's suggestions have pointed out the direction of the struggle. The peace-loving people of all countries must make persistent efforts to strive for a solution to the German question on a peaceful and democratic basis and establish a European collective security system.

### 为争取和平解决德国问题和巩固欧洲和平而努力

    为争取和平解决德国问题和巩固欧洲和平而努力
    在德国问题和欧洲安全问题上正展开着两条路线的斗争。一方面是苏联为争取和平解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系进行着坚定不移的努力；另一方面美、英、法等西方国家在加紧策划复活德国军国主义和在欧洲建立新的军事集团。苏联政府于十月二十三日照会法、英、美三国政府，建议在今年十一月召开法、英、美、苏四国外长会议，来讨论在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一、举行全德自由选举、四国占领军撤出东西德的领土以及有关召开全欧会议筹建欧洲集体安全体系等问题；就在同一天，西方国家的外长们却在巴黎签订了一系列目的在于实现重新武装西德和拼凑军事集团的协定。当前局势的这种发展，对于德国的命运和欧洲的前途有着重大的关系，因此不能不引起欧洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的密切注视和严重警惕。
    今年一月起在柏林举行的四国外长会议，由于西方三国的阻挠未能就德国问题和欧洲安全问题取得协议，但是这些问题并没有从日程上抹掉。柏林会议结束以来，苏联为了争取这些问题的解决，曾一再向法、英、美政府提出建议，主张召开全欧会议讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题和召开四国外长会议讨论德国问题及其他问题。很显然，如果西方三国对这些建议予以应有的重视和考虑，有关各国是能够在解决德国问题和欧洲安全问题上获得进展的。“欧洲防务集团”条约的破产，更增加了解决这些问题的有利条件。但是西方国家却不顾苏联的建议，继续追求使西德重新军国主义化的新计划。在这种情形下，苏联政府本着从速解决德国问题以巩固欧洲和平和安全的立场，于十月二十三日的照会中再一次进行了建设性的努力，以给和平解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系问题开辟道路，苏联的这种争取和平的行动和法、英、美等西方国家目前所遵循的加深德国和欧洲分裂的方针成为强烈的对照。
    不论是从德国人民的民族利益或者从欧洲各国安全的利益出发，德国问题的解决都是不容再拖延的了。苏联政府在十月二十三日的照会中指出：“最重要和最紧迫的任务是恢复德国的统一，使它成为一个和平的和民主的国家，并且同它缔结和约。”为了恢复德国的统一，有必要举行使德国人民能够表达其自由意志的全德的自由选举。苏联政府表示愿意再度研究在柏林会议上经英国提出并经法国和美国支持的关于举行全德选举的建议，只要对苏联提出的相应的建议也同时予以研究。苏联这种积极谋求协商的态度充分说明了苏联对和平解决德国问题的诚意。而西方国家在伦敦和巴黎会议中通过的协议，却是允许西德建立起拥有五十万人的一支军队；西德的重工业也将重新大规模地生产军火。公开推行这种复活德国军国主义的政策的结果，必然是使西德变成欧洲的新战争的温床，并且就会使西德的复仇主义势力放手来执行他们在欧洲的侵略政策了。
    为了促进德国问题的解决，苏联政府一贯地竭力设法为德国两个部分的接近提供条件。苏联政府早在今年三月就宣布与德意志民主共和国建立和其他主权国家一样的关系，德意志民主共和国有全权来和西德进行谈判。苏联政府在柏林会议上就曾建议和法、英、美三国政府讨论从德国东西两部撤退占领军的问题，现在并建议毫不拖延地撤退占领军。很显然，这种决定对于恢复德国统一和巩固欧洲和平都有很大的作用。但是西方国家的伦敦和巴黎协定，却片面地规定了美、英、法三国的占领军将继续留驻西德五十年，而且占领军的数目还可以随时增加。这就是说，西德在半个世纪之内将不能摆脱被外国军队占领和殖民地化的命运。而美、英、法三国竟无耻地说这是恢复西德的“主权”，“终止在西德的占领制度”。任何人都可以看出，西德受了这种约束，就将使恢复德国的统一在长期间内成为不可能。
    苏联一贯主张为了保障欧洲安全，必须建立一个全欧集体安全体系，而不是建立侵略性的军事集团。苏联早已提出的全欧条约草案，包含着对法国和波兰、对英国和苏联以及对一切欧洲大小国家的安全的真正保障。同时它为重新建立德国的国家统一、为德国的自由和平发展创造了有利的条件。苏联现在重申由四国外长来讨论召开全欧会议以筹建全欧集体安全体系的主张，这是完全符合欧洲各国人民的共同愿望和巩固欧洲的和平的利益的。但是西方国家在“欧洲防务集团”计划垮台之后，却又拼凑起有西德参加的、并包括英国在内的新的军事集团——西欧联盟，并且进一步地把西德拉进北大西洋集团。这就势必造成欧洲国家的对立和加剧国际紧张局势。
    西方国家重新武装西德的计划是和目前在联合国中正在进行的裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的讨论直接相冲突的。大家知道，在裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题上，苏联和西方国家之间的意见已经有所接近。苏联不但曾建议以法、美关于这个问题的建议为基础，并且同加、法、美、英在联合国中提出了一个联合提案。在裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题上的这种进展是有助于缓和国际紧张局势的。但是，不可能一面建议普遍裁减军备，一面实行西德重新军国主义化。这两个行为是不能相容的。西方国家的这种做法，只会促成国际局势的恶化。
    事情很显然，目前形成的情况是：要末就是对解决德国问题负有特别责任的苏联、法国、英国和美国作一切努力来审查和解决恢复德国统一的问题，以便实现德国人民的愿望，并巩固欧洲的和平；要末就是事情发展到德国军国主义复活和西德加入侵略性的军事集团，那样德国就会长久分裂下去，而重新军国主义化的西德就会成为对欧洲和平的直接威胁。由此可见，苏联政府十月二十三日在致法、英、美三国政府的照会中所提出的建议，有着十分迫切的重要意义。各国爱好和平的人民对苏联的建议都热烈地表示支持和拥护。
    但是，美国侵略集团和它的追随者却对于苏联这种谋求和平的真诚努力感到十分恐慌。他们害怕苏联的建议所产生的影响，会使他们复活德国军国主义的新计划遭到像“欧洲防务集团”一样的命运。因而，他们一面极力歪曲说苏联的建议没有包括“新的东西”，以图减低它的重要意义，一面扬言在他们的伦敦和巴黎协定没有批准以前，不和苏联举行谈判。美国总统艾森豪威尔在十月二十五日说：“新的欧洲团结可能成为同俄国人进行谈判的基础，这种基础是现在所不存在的。”英国首相邱吉尔在十月二十六日也公开表示：“当此在西欧达成的协议仍有待批准的阶段，我并不认为举行四大国会议的时机已经到来。”“实力政策”追求者的这种言论表明，他们将不顾一切地来推行在欧洲准备新战争的政策。
    但是人们知道，无数的事实早已证明：在保卫和平的力量日益强大的当前的形势下，推行准备战争和对爱好和平的国家进行讹诈的“实力政策”从来不会有好结果的。追随美国的西欧国家，特别是法国，接受这样的政策尤其将招致严重的后果。它们这样做，将不可避免地使它们重新面对德国军国主义的侵略威胁，并使它们和爱好和平的国家对立起来。造成这种损害它们自己民族的利益和安全的责任，是在这些国家的现任政府自己的身上。
    各国爱好和平的人民，特别是欧洲各国人民的眼睛是明亮的，他们已清楚地看出美国及其伙伴们复活德国军国主义计划的罪恶实质；西欧各国公众，包括法国和西德的广泛阶层人士，纷纷要求和苏联举行谈判，以谋求欧洲的集体和平。各国公众的这种普遍呼声是不容忽视的。
    苏联的建议已指出了斗争的方向；各国爱好和平人民必须进行坚持不懈的努力，以争取在和平民主的基础上解决德国问题并建立欧洲集体安全体系。
