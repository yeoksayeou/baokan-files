(Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th) According to TASS, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its discussion on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction on the 12th.

    U.S. Representative Wadsworth stated that the U.S. "hopes for truly effective disarmament" and that the U.S. "will not use atomic weapons or any other weapons except to resist aggression." At the same time, however, he declared on the spot that the U.S. "cannot stop the arms race." He attempted to distort the Soviet Union's sincere desire to seek disarmament and distort the Soviet proposals on disarmament.

    Although the U.S. representative admitted that the provisions in the Soviet proposal could be accepted as a basis for further discussion and resolution of this issue, he, like the representatives of Britain and France, requested some "clarifications" and "explanations" of the Soviet proposal.

    Finally, the U.S. representative pointed out that "the current Soviet proposals do seem to open the way for further discussion," while saying, "We certainly have not rejected it."

    The Philippine representative stated that the general debate on this issue has made it possible to reach some general agreement on certain issues. He believed that Vyshinsky's speech on the 11th "greatly advanced towards a common goal." The Philippine representative suggested that a subcommittee be formed by representatives of the five major powers to study the proposals of "both sides."

    Regarding this, the Iranian representative suggested that this working group should include representatives of countries directly related to the resolution of this issue.

    Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke to refute the U.S. representative's distortion of the Soviet proposals. Vyshinsky also spoke about the U.S. attitude on the issue of establishing a supervisory body. In the U.S.'s view, the supervisory body should have the power to take punitive measures against violators of international agreements on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Vyshinsky pointed out that the functions of the supervisory body should not include the power to punish acts that violate such agreements, because according to the United Nations Charter, such functions can only belong to the Security Council. To go beyond the functions of the Security Council would be a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet Union believes that if the supervisory body discovers acts that violate international agreements, it must report such acts to the Security Council, which will decide on measures to be taken. Needless to say, as far as supervision is concerned, the international supervisory body must have full possibilities to act independently, and the Security Council has no right to interfere.

    Finally, Vyshinsky pointed out that the Philippine representative's speech was more constructive and gave people hope that representatives of other countries—even though they did not participate in the Disarmament Commission or its subcommittee—could also help solve such important issues as disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. Vyshinsky supported the Iranian representative's suggestion regarding the members of the subcommittee proposed by the Philippine representative.

### 联大政委会继续讨论裁减军备问题  维辛斯基斥责美国代表歪曲苏联的建议

    联大政委会继续讨论裁减军备问题
    维辛斯基斥责美国代表歪曲苏联的建议
      【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十二日继续讨论裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题。
    美国代表华兹沃斯说什么美国“希望真正有效的裁减军备”，美国“除了抵抗侵略外将不使用原子武器或其他任何武器”。但同时，他又当场宣布美国“不能停止军备竞赛”。他企图歪曲苏联谋求裁减军备的真诚愿望，歪曲苏联关于裁军的建议。
    虽然美国代表承认，苏联提案中的规定可以被接受作为进一步讨论和解决这个问题的基础，但他像英国和法国代表的发言一样，要求对苏联的提案作一些“澄清”和“说明”。
    最后，美国代表指出，“苏联目前的建议的确似乎为进一步的讨论开辟了道路”，他同时说，“我们肯定地没有拒绝它”。
    菲律宾代表发言说，关于这个问题的一般性辩论已使在某些问题上达成某种一般性的协议成为可能。他认为，维辛斯基十一日的发言“向共同的目标大大地前进了一步”。菲律宾代表建议由五大国代表成立一个小组委员会来研究“双方”的建议。
    关于这一点，伊朗代表建议，这个工作小组应该包括与这个问题的解决直接有关的国家的代表。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言驳斥了美国代表对苏联的建议的歪曲说法。维辛斯基并谈到美国在建立监督机构的问题上的态度。在美国看来，监督机构应该有权对关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的国际协定的破坏者采取惩罚措施。维辛斯基指出，监督机构的职权不应包括惩罚破坏这种协定的行为的权力，因为按照联合国宪章规定，这种职权只能属于安全理事会。超越安全理事会的职权，就是对联合国宪章的公然破坏。苏联认为，如果监督机构发现了破坏国际协定的行为时，它必须把这种行为报告安全理事会，安全理事会将决定采取措施。不用说，就监督而论，国际监督机构必须有充分的可能性来独立行动，安全理事会无权干涉。
    最后，维辛斯基指出，菲律宾代表的发言是比较具有建设性的，并且使人们可以希望其他国家的代表——尽管他们并没有参加裁减军备委员会或它的小组委员会的工作——也能从他们那方面帮助解决像裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器这样重要的问题。维辛斯基支持伊朗代表就菲律宾代表建议成立的小组委员会提出的关于这个委员会的成员的建议。
