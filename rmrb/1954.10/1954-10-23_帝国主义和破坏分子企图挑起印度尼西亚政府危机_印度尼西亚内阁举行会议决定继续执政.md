Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 22nd: The Indonesian cabinet issued a statement after a meeting held on the evening of the 21st, stating that the current Indonesian cabinet will continue in power. The statement said: After discussing the Great Indonesia Unity Party's demand for the cabinet to resign, the cabinet decided to reject this request from the Great Indonesia Unity Party's Executive Committee. Members of the Great Indonesia Unity Party who are part of the current cabinet attended the meeting. The cabinet continued to meet on the 22nd.
   Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 21st: In recent days, Indonesian political parties have held meetings and consultations on the issue of the Great Indonesia Unity Party Executive Committee's demand on the evening of the 17th for the current cabinet to resign. Most parties have stated that the current cabinet should be allowed to continue in power.

    The Indonesian Political Party Group Consultation Committee held a meeting on the 20th. All ruling parties except the Great Indonesia Unity Party attended the meeting. A communique issued after the meeting stated: "The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to overcome the current difficulties. The resolution includes the decision not to dissolve the current cabinet, but to improve and strengthen it." The meeting itself shows that the current cabinet can continue to govern without the participation of the Great Indonesia Unity Party.

        Before the meeting, Yoyosukarto, Mangunsakoro, and Sastroamidjojo (representing the Indonesian Nationalist Party) discussed the cabinet situation with Arifin and Dahlan (representing the Indonesian Islamic Union Party), and it is said that they reached a good understanding on this issue.

    After the Great Indonesia Unity Party demanded the resignation of the cabinet, Indonesian Nationalist Party Chairman Yoyosukarto commented that the dissolution of the cabinet at this time would be extremely detrimental to the Indonesian nation and people. The party's vice-chairman, Mangunsakoro, also warned on the 18th that foreign subversive elements are constantly working to achieve their goals by hiring "prominent figures" in the country.

    According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit issued a statement on the current domestic political situation on the 20th. Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party believes that the current cabinet should be maintained. Aidit said that the resignation of the Sastroamidjojo cabinet at this time would only benefit foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries. Aidit then pointed out that American and Dutch imperialists, as well as Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang secret agents, are increasingly frantically carrying out activities in an attempt to provoke a government crisis in Indonesia. Aidit said that the current government's foreign policy aims to conduct international cooperation to lead to world peace and mutual benefit for all countries. The government has begun to implement normal trade relations, abolished the federal relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands, and is striving to return West Irian, abolish "embargoes," and eliminate colonialism. Although the Indonesian Communist Party recognizes that the current cabinet has many shortcomings, it will continue to support it. Aidit said that if the Great Indonesia Unity Party insists on recalling its ministers, then these ministers should be replaced by others. The cabinet should take more progressive measures to gain stronger support from the people. If the cabinet has to be dissolved, the Indonesian Communist Party will insist on organizing a national united front government that includes the Communist Party.

    Antara News Agency also reported that Ali Sastroamidjojo had received many telegrams from all over Indonesia demanding that the current cabinet continue in power, believing that the fall of the current cabinet would endanger national interests.

    At the same time, the Great Indonesia Unity Party's leadership's attitude towards overthrowing the current cabinet has been opposed by the party's vast membership. Among the party's 136 branches, 81 branches have requested that the party's Executive Committee withdraw its statement demanding the cabinet's resignation.

    帝国主义和破坏分子企图挑起印度尼西亚政府危机
    印度尼西亚内阁举行会议决定继续执政
    【新华社雅加达二十二日电】印度尼西亚内阁在二十一日晚举行会议后发表公告，表示印度尼西亚现内阁将继续执政。公告说：在讨论了大印度尼西亚统一党要求内阁辞职的决定后，内阁决定拒绝大印度尼西亚统一党执行委员会的这个要求。参加现内阁的大印度尼西亚统一党阁员们出席了这一会议。内阁在二十二日继续开会。
   【新华社雅加达二十一日电】印度尼西亚各政党在最近几天就大印度尼西亚统一党执行委员会十七日晚要求现内阁辞职问题，举行会议并进行协商。多数党派表示，应当让现任内阁继续执政。
    印度尼西亚政党团体协商委员会在二十日举行了会议。除大印度尼西亚统一党以外，各执政党派都参加会议。会后发表的公报说：“会议一致通过决议，要克服目前的某些困难。决议中包括不解散现内阁而要改进和加强它的决定。”会议本身表明，现内阁是可以在没有大印度尼西亚统一党参加的情况下而继续执政的。
        在会议举行以前，约约苏卡托、曼贡萨科罗和沙斯特罗阿米佐约（代表印度尼西亚国民党）同阿里芬以及达伦（代表印度尼西亚回教联盟党）就内阁形势问题进行了讨论，据说他们在这个问题上获得了很好的谅解。
    在大印度尼西亚统一党提出要求内阁辞职以后，印度尼西亚国民党主席约约苏卡托发表评论说，内阁在这个时候解散，将对印度尼西亚国家和人民极为不利。该党副主席曼贡萨科罗也在十八日提出警告说，外国颠覆分子正在不停地进行工作，以雇用这个国家的“显要人物”的办法来达到他们的目标。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地二十日就目前国内政治局势发表了声明。艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党认为现内阁应予以维持。艾地说，沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁在目前辞职，只对外国帝国主义和国内反动派有利。艾地接着指出，美国和荷兰帝国主义以及蒋介石国民党特务日益疯狂地进行活动，企图挑起印度尼西亚的政府危机。艾地说，现政府的外交政策的目的是要进行国际合作以导致世界和平和各国互利。政府已开始实行正常的贸易关系，废除了印度尼西亚和荷兰的联邦关系，并正在争取归还西伊里安、取消“禁运”和消灭殖民主义。印度尼西亚共产党虽然认识到现内阁有许多缺点，但是仍将继续支持它。艾地说，如果大印度尼西亚统一党坚持召回它的部长，那么这些部长应由别人代替。内阁应采取更进步的措施以取得人民的更有力的支持。如果内阁不得不解散，印度尼西亚共产党将坚持组织一个包括共产党的民族统一战线政府。
    安塔拉通讯社并报道，阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约收到了来自印度尼西亚各地的许多要求现内阁继续执政的电报，这些电报认为现内阁的倒台会危害民族的利益。
    同时，大印度尼西亚统一党的领导机构致力于推翻现内阁的态度，遭到了这个党广大党员的反对。在这个党的一百三十六个支部中，已有八十一个支部要求该党执行委员会收回关于要求内阁辞职的声明。
