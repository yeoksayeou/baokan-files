The Rebirth of China's Tea Production

Jin Shanbao, Delegate to the National People's Congress, President of Nanjing Agricultural College

China has a long history of tea tree cultivation for more than two thousand years and is the origin of tea trees in the world. The tea-producing countries in the world today, such as India, Ceylon, Indonesia, and Japan, all introduced tea trees directly or indirectly from China. In China, tea trees are distributed in more than 500 counties in sixteen provinces, including Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Tea production is abundant, the quality is excellent, and there are many varieties of famous tea. "Qihong" and "Tunlv" produced in the Huangshan Mountains of Anhui Province have long been cherished by international people. Wuyi "Rock Tea" produced in Wuyi Mountain in Fujian Province, "Longjing" in West Lake in Zhejiang, and "Pu'er" in Yunnan are all well-known teas at home and abroad. China's tea exports have long occupied an important position in the world market. The vast number of farmers in the eastern, central south, and southwest provinces of China have always regarded tea production as their main sideline income. However, since the end of the 19th century, the tea market has been manipulated and monopolized by imperialism, and tea production has been restricted and gradually declined. Especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, comprador capitalists colluded with imperialism to wantonly sabotage and devastate tea production, a large number of tea gardens were abandoned, and production plummeted. On the eve of liberation, the area of tea gardens was only 40 percent of the total area before the Anti-Japanese War, and the output and export volume of tea were only about one-quarter of those before the Anti-Japanese War. The lives of tea farmers were plunged into hunger and poverty. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, tea production was reborn.

		Reclaimed Abandoned Tea Gardens and Opened
		New-Style Tea Gardens

After the founding of the Central People's Government in 1949, it immediately began to restore tea production. First, it adopted various effective measures such as raising tea prices, opening up sales channels, and providing loan support to mobilize tea farmers to reclaim the tea gardens that had been abandoned in the past. In the land reform movement, it also led farmers to take back their tea gardens from the landlords, and the enthusiasm of tea farmers in operating tea production was greatly improved. Over the past five years, most of the abandoned tea gardens that could be reclaimed in various places have been reclaimed. For example, in Hunan Province, the area of tea gardens in 1949 was only 33 percent of that before the war, and in 1953 it had recovered to 80 percent of that before the war. In Fujian Province, more than 64,000 mu of tea gardens were reclaimed in one year from 1952 to 1953. At the same time as the work of reclaiming abandoned tea gardens was carried out, various places also planned and led tea farmers to reorganize and transform the original tea gardens. By replanting missing seedlings and increasing new seedlings, the original scattered and disorganized tea gardens are being changed into neat tea gardens, fully utilizing the land fertility and increasing the yield per unit area. Anxi County in Fujian Province replanted more than 3 million missing seedlings in the first half of 1954 alone. This work is gradually expanding, and it will play an important role in increasing tea production in the future.

	Considerable achievements have also been made in opening up new tea gardens. In Fujian Province alone, more than 19,000 mu of new tea gardens were opened up in one year from 1952 to 1953. The state has also newly built or reorganized and expanded many state-owned tea farms on the original basis. These newly opened tea farms are generally operated in accordance with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. They have not only demonstrated to the vast number of tea farmers and set an example for the future development of new tea gardens and the transformation of old tea gardens, but also laid the foundation for the further development of tea production in the future.

	Developed Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations and Improved
		Technology

The vast majority of tea farmers in China are farmers who also engage in agriculture or are mainly engaged in agricultural production. The decentralized management method of one household restricts not only the development of agricultural production but also the development of tea production. In particular, tea requires a series of relatively complex technologies and processing equipment in the production process, and the tea season is also the busy season for other agricultural activities. Therefore, there are often conflicts in the arrangement of agricultural and tea production. Therefore, the party and government leaders in various tea-producing areas regard carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement as a major task in restoring and developing tea production. In the past few years, mutual aid and cooperative organizations for tea production have developed to a certain extent. Especially after the publicity and education of the general task of the national transition period, tea farmers have further realized the socialist road of organizing, so mutual aid and cooperative organizations have greatly developed and improved in quantity and quality. According to statistics from 25 counties including Sheng County in Zhejiang Province, in 1954 there were 29 agricultural and tea production cooperatives, 6,473 mutual aid groups, and 735 tea preliminary processing stations. In the main tea areas of Sheng County, Hang County, Pujiang, Fuyang, and other counties, more than 70 percent of tea farmers have participated in various forms of mutual aid organizations. In the past three years, there have been nearly 8,000 mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Fujian Province, including joint transportation and sales groups, joint tea making groups, agricultural and tea integration mutual aid groups, and tea production cooperatives. The preliminary processing of Dianhong tea in the Yunnan Dianhong tea area has all been carried out through the form of preliminary processing stations. These mutual aid and cooperative organizations generally show the superiority of being organized, and have played a huge role in solving the contradictions between agricultural and tea production seasons, adjusting labor and tools, improving technology, increasing production, and improving quality.

	In terms of technology improvement, there are already 20 tea experimental farms in the country, and tea technology guidance stations have been generally established in key tea areas. These experimental tea farms have played a certain role in demonstrating the masses and guiding production in tea garden management, the improvement of preliminary processing technology, and other work. Tea technology guidance stations are a powerful organizational form for promoting tea production technology. At present, general tea gardens have generally carried out intertillage, and the work of fertilizing tea gardens, pruning tea trees, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and conserving water and soil has been carried out to varying degrees. In terms of picking, reasonable picking methods such as "picking in time and in batches" have been adopted, which has basically reversed the extensive picking situation in the past where old and tender were not distinguished and all were picked at once. In terms of preliminary processing technology, various reasonable methods have been adopted for different types of tea, and various small tea-making machines have begun to be used. In the past few years, more than 10,000 sets of tea rolling machines alone have been promoted nationwide.

	Output Increased, Quality Improved

Due to the above-mentioned work in various aspects, tea production has been rapidly restored and developed in the past few years. If the total tea output of the country is taken as 100 in 1949, it has increased to 188.34 in 1953, and it is estimated that it can reach more than 200 in 1954. The quality has also improved significantly. In 1953, the quantity of medium and high-grade tea transported and sold to the Soviet Union by state-owned companies increased by 12.03 percent compared with 1952, of which black tea increased by 26.41 percent. In recent years, tea production has been able to meet the needs of the people to a certain extent, and the quantity of tea exported to foreign countries has also increased year by year. Judging from the sales figures of tea by state-owned companies, if the sales quantity in various inland provinces in the country is taken as 100 in 1950, it has reached 711.35 in 1953. In remote ethnic minority areas, if it is taken as 100 in 1951, it has reached 194.45 in 1953. In terms of foreign sales, if the export quantity in 1950 is taken as 100, it has increased to 231.65 in 1953. Tea production has played a certain role in supporting national industrial construction.

	The Lives of Tea Farmers Have Been Initially Improved

With the gradual recovery of tea production, the lives of tea farmers have been initially improved. There are about 10,000 tea farmers in the Qionglai Mountain tea area in Sichuan Province. Before liberation, due to the abandonment of tea gardens, the lives of tea farmers were very difficult. They lived in thatched cottages, wore rags, ate cornmeal and wild vegetables, and most of the bedding was palm mats. After liberation, with the loan support of the local people's government, the tea gardens have been restored. The lives of tea farmers have been significantly improved. For example, after tea farmer Hou Huabing sold tea in 1953, in addition to buying back enough seeds and fertilizers, he also exchanged 800 jin of rice, nine pieces of blue cloth, and two cans of milk powder. Lei Yuyuan's family of eleven could not afford to eat or wear in 1949, but now their lives have completely changed. They have all kinds of agricultural tools, pigs and cattle, and the house has also been built. The family lives happily. When he sees people, he likes to say: "I plant more than six mu of tea land. In 1949, I produced 160 jin of dried tea leaves, which could buy 340 jin of rice. In 1953, I produced more than 240 jin of dried tea, which could buy 2,500 jin of rice. In terms of output, it only increased by half, but in terms of income, it increased by nearly seven times." In Huangshi Township, Jinzhai County, the production area of the famous tea "Qishan Yunwu" in Anhui Province, more than two-fifths of the tea gardens in the township were abandoned when it was just liberated. Many tea farmers always dug wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger every year during the green and yellow season. Now, with the reclamation and development of tea gardens, there is no longer any phenomenon of eating wild vegetables and "running out of food", and three year-round private schools and one private primary school have been established in the mountain village, and fifty-one young men and women and more than fifty children have the opportunity to study year-round. In Shaban Township, Luoyuan County, Fujian Province, 346 farmer households have tea gardens, and tea production income accounts for an average of 37 percent of the farmers' total income. Before liberation, because the tea gardens were destroyed, people suffered from spring famine every year and became a "grain-deficient township". In recent years, because tea production has gradually recovered, the "grain-deficient township" has become a "grain-surplus township". Last year, the whole township sold a total of 30,000 jin of surplus grain, supporting national industrial construction. The improvement of the lives of tea farmers in other provinces is similar to the above-mentioned places.

	The achievements on the tea production front in the past five years are quite significant. But this is only a beginning. At present, tea output has not yet recovered to the pre-war level, and with the gradual realization of national industrialization, the continuous improvement of people's living standards, and the continuous expansion of domestic and foreign sales markets, it is still an urgent task before us to further restore and develop tea production to adapt to the development of the entire national economy.

    发展土产、特产和渔业，满足人民和国家的需要
    我国茶叶生产的新生
    全国人民代表大会代表  南京农学院院长  金善宝
    我国栽培茶树已有两千多年的悠久历史，是世界上茶树的原产地。现在世界上的产茶国家像印度、锡兰、印度尼西亚和日本等国的茶树，都是直接或间接由我国传入的。我国茶树分布在浙江、安徽、福建、湖南、湖北、江西、四川、云南等十六省五百余县。茶叶生产产量丰富，品质优良，名茶的品类很多。安徽省黄山山区出产的“祁红”、“屯绿”，早为国际人士所珍爱。福建省武夷山出产的武夷
  “岩茶”、浙江西湖的“龙井”、云南的“普洱”等都是国内外知名的名茶。我国茶叶的输出长期在世界市场上占居重要地位。华东、中南、西南各省的广大农民向来以茶叶生产为主要副业收入。但自十九世纪末叶以来，茶叶市场受到帝国主义的操纵垄断，茶叶生产受到限制因而逐渐下降。特别在国民党反动统治时期，买办资本与帝国主义互相勾结，对茶叶生产大肆破坏摧残，大量茶园荒芜，生产一落千丈。解放前夕，茶园面积只剩下抗日战争前总面积的百分之四十，茶叶生产量及输出量均低到抗日战争前四分之一左右。茶农的生活陷于饥饿贫穷的境地。解放以后，在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，茶叶生产才获得了新生。
      垦复了荒废茶园，开辟了
        新式茶园
    一九四九年中央人民政府成立以后，即着手恢复茶叶生产的工作，首先采取了提高茶叶价格，打开销路，贷款扶持等各种有效措施，动员茶农垦复过去荒弃了的茶园。在土地改革运动中，又领导农民从地主手中夺回了自己的茶园，茶农经营茶叶生产的情绪大大提高。五年来，各地有条件垦复的荒芜茶园大部分都已垦复。如湖南省一九四九年茶园面积仅及战前的百分之三十三，一九五三年已经恢复到战前的百分之八十。福建省在一九五二到一九五三年一年中，即垦复茶园六万四千多亩。与垦复荒芜茶园工作进行的同时，各地并有计划地领导茶农对原有茶园进行了整理与改造的工作，通过补植缺株，增植新株，使原有零星散乱的茶园正改变成整齐的茶园，充分利用了地力，提高了单位面积产量。福建安溪县仅一九五四年上半年就补植缺株达三百余万株。这项工作正在逐步扩展，对于今后茶叶产量的增加将起重要的作用。
      在开辟新茶园方面也获得了不少的成就。仅福建一省在一九五二到一九五三年一年中，就新辟茶园一万九千多亩。国家又新建或者在原有基础上整顿扩大了不少国营茶场。这些新辟的茶场，一般都是按照苏联的先进经验进行经营的，不仅向广大茶农进行了示范，为将来发展新茶园与改造旧茶园树立了榜样，同时也为今后茶叶生产进一步发展奠定了基础。
    发展了互助合作组织，改进
        了技术
    我国的茶农绝大部分是兼营农业或以农业生产为主的农民。以一家一户为单位的分散经营方式不仅限制了农业生产的发展，而且限制了茶叶生产的发展，特别是茶叶在产制过程中需要一系列的比较复杂的技术和加工设备，同时茶季又正是其他农事的忙季，所以在农业与茶叶生产的安排上，常常发生矛盾，因此，各产茶区的党政领导以开展互助合作运动为恢复发展茶叶生产的一项主要工作。几年来，茶叶生产互助合作组织已有了一定程度的发展，特别是经过国家过渡时期总任务的宣传教育后，茶农对组织起来走社会主义的道路，有了进一步的认识，因而互助合作组织在数量和质量上都有了很大发展和提高。据浙江嵊县等二十五个县的统计，一九五四年共有农茶业结合的生产合作社二十九个，互助组六千四百七十三个，茶叶初制所七百三十五个。嵊县、杭县、浦江、富阳等县的主要茶区已有百分之七十以上的茶农参加了各种形式的互助组织。福建省最近三年来已有合伙运售组、联合制茶组、农茶结合互助组、茶叶生产合作社等四种互助合作组织近八千个。云南滇红茶区红茶的初制已全部通过初制所的形式进行。这些互助合作组织一般都显示了组织起来的优越性，在解决农茶业生产季节之间的矛盾，劳力、工具的调剂、技术的改进、产量的增加、品质的提高等方面，都起了巨大的作用。
    在改进技术方面，全国已经有二十个茶叶试验场，在重点茶区普遍建立了茶业技术指导站。这些试验茶场在茶园管理、初制技术的改进等工作方面，均起到了一定的示范群众与指导生产的作用。茶业技术指导站是推广茶叶生产技术有力的组织形式。目前一般茶园已普遍进行中耕，茶园的施肥、茶树的修剪、防治病虫、水土保持等工作，都有了不同程度的开展。在采摘上，采用了“及时采，分批采”等合理采摘方法，基本上扭转了过去老嫩不分，一次采光的粗放采摘情况。在初制技术方面，分别不同茶类，采用了各种合理方法，并开始采用了各种小型制茶机械。单是揉捻机一项，几年来全国即已推广了一万架以上。
    产量增加了，品质提高了
    由于进行了以上各方面的工作，几年来茶叶生产已得到了迅速的恢复和发展。全国茶叶总产量如以一九四九年为一百，一九五三年已增加到一百八十八点三四，一九五四年估计可以达到二百以上。品质也显著提高。一九五三年国营公司运销苏联中级以上茶叶的数量较一九五二年增加了百分之十二点零三，其中红茶增加了百分之二十六点四一。近年来的茶叶生产已能在一定程度上满足人民的需要，茶叶向国外输出的数量也逐年增加。从国营公司销售茶叶的数字上看，在国内内地各省的销售数量如以一九五零年为一百，则一九五三年已达七百一十一点三五。在边远的少数民族地区，如以一九五一年为一百，一九五三年已到一百九十四点四五。在外销方面，如以一九五零年的出口数量为一百，则一九五三年已增加到二百三十一点六五。茶叶生产对支援国家工业建设已起着一定的作用。
    茶农生活初步得到了改善
    随着茶叶生产的逐渐恢复，茶农的生活已得到了初步改善。四川省邛崃山茶区约有一万户茶农，解放前因为茶园荒废，茶农们的生活十分困苦，他们住的是茅草屋，穿的是破布片，吃的是玉米面、野菜，铺的盖的大都是棕垫。解放后，在当地人民政府的贷款扶持下，茶园已经恢复。茶农的生活显著地得到了改善。如茶农侯华炳一九五三年卖了茶，除买回足够的种籽和肥料外，还换回大米八百斤，九块土蓝布，两筒奶粉。茶农雷雨援一家十一口人，一九四九年还是顾不上吃，顾不上穿，如今生活已完全变了样，农具、猪牛样样齐全，屋子也盖好了，一家人生活得欢欢喜喜。他见了人就爱说：
  “我种六亩多茶地，一九四九年产干茶叶一百六十斤，可买大米三百四十斤，一九五三年产干茶二百四十多斤，可买大米二千五百斤，论产量只增产了一半，论收入却增加了近七倍。”安徽省名茶“齐山云雾”的产地金寨县黄石乡，刚解放时，全乡茶园荒芜了五分之二以上。许多茶农每年在青黄不接时总是挖野菜糊口。现在随着茶园的垦复发展，再没有吃野菜、“断顿”的现象了，而且山村里设立了三所常年民校，一所民办小学，五十一个男女青年和五十多个小孩都有了常年学习的机会。福建省罗源县沙坂乡三百四十六户农民都有茶园，茶叶生产收入平均占农民总收入的百分之三十七。解放前因茶园被破坏，人们年年闹春荒，成了“缺粮乡”。近几年来因为茶叶生产逐渐恢复，“缺粮乡”变成了
  “余粮乡”，去年全乡共卖了三万斤余粮，支援了国家工业建设。其他各省茶农生活的改善情况，都和以上各地相类似。
    五年来茶叶生产战线上的成就是相当巨大的。但这只不过是一个开端。目前茶叶产量尚未恢复到战前水平，而随着国家工业化的逐步实现，人民生活水平的不断提高，国内外销售市场的不断扩大，更进一步地恢复与发展茶叶生产以与整个国民经济的发展相适应，还是摆在我们面前的迫切任务。（附图片）
