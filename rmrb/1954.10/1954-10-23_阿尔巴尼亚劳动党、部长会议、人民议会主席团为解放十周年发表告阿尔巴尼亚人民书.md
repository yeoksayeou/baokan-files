Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 20th: The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, the Presidium of the People's Assembly, and the National Committee of the Democratic Front have issued a letter to the Albanian people on the tenth anniversary of Albania's liberation.

The letter to the people states that November 29th marks the tenth anniversary of the Albanian working class and working peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party, forever escaping fascist oppression and establishing a people's regime in Albania. The liberation of the Albanian people should be attributed to the glorious Soviet army, which crushed the war machine of Hitler's Germany.

The letter to the people points out that ten years is only a short period, but during this period, enormous changes have taken place in our country's life. In industry, before liberation, Albania had only a few small factories and mines belonging to capitalists. But now, new industries with modern technical equipment, owned by all the people, have been established. By the end of 1954, the total industrial output will increase to 11.4 times the pre-war level. Agriculture has also made great progress. In 1954, the sown area was 69.7 percent larger than before the war. Railway transportation and trade are also developing rapidly.

The rapid development of the national economy has improved the material and cultural life of the working masses. In 1954, residents received 68 percent more sugar than in 1950, 37.6 percent more meat and fish, 101.1 percent more cotton fabrics, 73 percent more woolen fabrics, and 137.3 percent more leather shoes. In education and culture, before liberation, more than 80 percent of the residents were illiterate. Now, this backward phenomenon left over from the past is being rapidly eliminated. Primary compulsory education has now been implemented. In 1938, there were only 643 primary schools, 11 seven-year schools, and secondary schools in the country, while in the 1954-1955 academic year, the number of primary schools has increased to 2,140, and the number of seven-year schools and secondary schools has increased to 343. In addition, six institutions of higher learning have been opened in the country. In 1953, the number of hospitals in the country increased to more than six times that of 1938. The state has allocated millions of lek (Albanian currency) for the social insurance of workers and staff, and for maternal and child health care. The population growth rate is increasing every year, and the mortality rate is constantly decreasing. Albania has also implemented three price reductions in the past five years.

The letter to the people points out that a decisive factor in the achievements of the Albanian people in domestic life and on the international stage is the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Albanian people and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

The letter to the people concludes by saying that the basis of our Party and government's foreign policy is: to defend peace, and to unswervingly consolidate friendship with the Soviet Union, friendship with the people's democratic countries, and with all people who are committed to peace. The government of the People's Republic of Albania advocates maintaining normal relations with all countries. It has always strived to promote the relaxation of international tensions, and will continue to contribute all its strength to this end in the future.

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、部长会议、人民议会主席团
    为解放十周年发表告阿尔巴尼亚人民书
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社地拉那二十日讯：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议、人民议会主席团和民主阵线全国委员会为阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年发表了告阿尔巴尼亚人民书。
    告人民书说，十一月二十九日是阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和劳动农民在共产党的领导下永远摆脱法西斯压迫和在阿尔巴尼亚建立人民政权的十周年纪念日。阿尔巴尼亚人民的解放应当感谢粉碎希特勒德国战争机器的光荣的苏联军队。
    告人民书指出，十年只是一段很短的时期，但是，在这段时期中，我国生活发生了巨大的变化。在工业方面，解放前，阿尔巴尼亚只有一些规模不大的属于资本家的工厂和矿山。可是现在已建立了属于全民所有的具有现代化技术设备的新工业。一九五四年年底，工业总产量将增为战前水平的十一点四倍。农业也有了巨大的进展。一九五四年，播种面积比战前扩大了百分之六十九点七。铁路交通和贸易也日益发展。
    国民经济的迅速发展使劳动群众的物质和文化生活得到改善。一九五四年居民得到的糖要比一九五○年多百分之六十八，肉类和鱼类多百分之三十七点六，棉织品多百分之一百零一点一，毛织品多百分之七十三，皮鞋多百分之一百三十七点三。在教育和文化方面，解放前国内有百分之八十以上的居民是文盲。现在这种过去遗留下来的落后现象正在迅速地消除中。现在初级义务教育已经推行。一九三八年国内只有六百四十三个小学，十一个七年制学校和中等学校，而在一九五四—一九五五学年，小学的数目已增加到二千一百四十个，七年制学校和中等学校已增加到三百四十三个。此外，国内还开办了六个高等学校。一九五三年国内医院的数目增为一九三八年的六倍以上。国家拨了数以百万计的里克（阿币名）用于职工的社会保险，用于妇婴保健事业。人口的增加率每年在上升，死亡率在不断下降。最近五年阿尔巴尼亚还实行了三次减低物价。
    告人民书指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民所以能在国内生活中和在国际舞台上取得成就，一个决定性的因素就是阿尔巴尼亚人民同苏联和人民民主国家的牢不可破的永恒的友谊。
    告人民书最后说，我们党和政府的对外政策的基础是：保卫和平，坚持不渝地巩固同苏联的友谊、同人民民主国家以及一切致力于和平的人民的友谊。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府主张同一切国家保持正常的关系。它向来致力促进国际紧张局势的缓和，今后仍将继续为此而贡献出一切力量。
