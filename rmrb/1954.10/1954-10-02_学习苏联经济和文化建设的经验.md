    The Soviet Union's Exhibition of Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction opens in Beijing today. Our people warmly welcome this exhibition, considering it another selfless and great act by the Soviet government and people to support our socialist construction.
    The Soviet Union's Exhibition of Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction has very rich content in industry, agriculture, culture, and other aspects. It is a microcosm of the socialist and communist construction undertaken by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and government. It demonstrates the high level of development of the socialist national economy and its great power, as well as the rich and varied Soviet culture and the increasingly prosperous and happy life of the Soviet people. The labor achievements of the Soviet people attract the working people of the world; for our people who are striving to carry out socialist construction, this is an even more vivid communist education.
    The Soviet Union is the first great socialist country in the world; the achievements and experiences gained by the Soviet people in the struggle to build socialism and communism under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government are the most valuable wealth of the working class worldwide. In the struggle to build socialism, the Soviet people not only overcame the difficulties caused by the armed intervention and blockade of the imperialist countries, but also had to build a socialist economy, so to speak, "on empty ground" and in unprecedented circumstances. Because of this, the imperialist countries at that time asserted that the revolutionary Bolshevik Party and the working class and working people it led were incapable of building socialism. However, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people victoriously completed the great historical task of building socialism, thereby making the Soviet Union the most advanced country with a modern and powerful industry and modern agriculture. On this basis, the Soviet Union is now continuing to strive to build the most fulfilling society for mankind—communism. This brilliant achievement of the Soviet people has opened the way for the people of other countries to move towards socialism.
    The fundamental purpose of our great people's revolution is to finally liberate our country's productive forces from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and also from the shackles of capitalism and the limitations of small-scale production, so that our national economy can achieve planned and rapid development along the socialist road, in order to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, recently adopted by the First Session of the First National People's Congress, stipulates: "The People's Republic of China relies on state organs and social forces, through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, to ensure the gradual elimination of the system of exploitation and the establishment of a socialist society." This great goal of building socialism in China is only now possible to achieve. In the past, our country suffered from long-term plunder by imperialism and the corrupt rule of domestic reactionaries, so there was no possibility of economic and cultural construction; only after our people achieved revolutionary victory, resolutely following the Soviet path, relying on Soviet assistance and experience, could we have achieved success in the work of restoring the national economy and carrying out socialist construction in a short period, and made rapid changes in the face of the country. On this basis, our country was able to begin implementing the First Five-Year Plan for socialist economic construction in 1953, and gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.
    The Soviet Union has given generous and selfless assistance to our country's work in restoring the national economy and building socialism. This is something the Chinese people will never forget. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union provided loans to our country on preferential terms, providing ample funds for our economic recovery and construction; a large number of Soviet experts were invited to our country to help with our construction, playing an important role in various construction projects. After the start of our country's First Five-Year Plan, according to the results of discussions between China and the Soviet Union on Soviet assistance to China, the Soviet government agreed to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the reconstruction and construction of 141 large-scale projects in our country by 1959. The enterprises that the Soviet Union helps our country build, from the selection of factory sites, the collection of basic design data, the determination of enterprise design tasks, the design, the supply of equipment, the guidance of construction and installation and start-up operations, to the manufacture of new products, and the provision of technical data for the manufacture of new products free of charge, are all fully assisted from beginning to end. Such great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance is an unprecedented undertaking in history. This fully embodies the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people.
    Our country was originally an economically and culturally backward country, and implementing planned construction, especially industrial construction, is a completely new subject for us. We have almost no experience at all, or we are very lacking in experience. Therefore, in order to realize our country's socialist construction, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is a matter of paramount importance. Comrade Mao Zedong, at the Fourth Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on February 7, 1953, when the construction of our country's First Five-Year Plan had just begun, once again called out: "We must launch a nationwide upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union to build our country." In recent years, cadres, technicians, and intellectuals in various work departments and enterprise departments of our country, as well as workers and peasants, have widely launched a movement to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in their work and production, and have achieved remarkable results. Our country's basic construction work, from planning, geological exploration, design and construction, to mastering production, has adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; our country's original enterprises, as well as expanded and newly built enterprises, rely on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union from enterprise management to technical measures. Similarly, in our country's agricultural production, cultural and educational work, and other departments, we have also worked hard to learn from and adopt the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The achievements of our country's various tasks, especially economic construction, are unimaginable without Soviet assistance and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
    The vast majority of our country's cadres, technicians, and intellectuals, as well as workers and peasants, are diligently and sincerely learning from the Soviet Union; even some people who were deeply influenced by distorted propaganda from the bourgeoisie in the past cannot help but admire the advanced experience and high technology of the Soviet Union after these years of practical experience. However, there are still two different expressions in the attitude of learning: one is to learn seriously and apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union correctly in combination with our country's actual conditions. This is a creative learning attitude. This is correct and should be promoted. The other is that a very small number of people are willing to learn, but often use the excuse that the advanced experience and technology of the Soviet Union are at a high level and their own level is low, or complain that the objective conditions are not enough and do not work hard to create conditions, thereby concealing themselves. This is a manifestation of lazy thinking, fearing difficulties and willingly lagging behind. This is what we should continue to overcome through persuasive education. Our construction undertaking is arduous and difficult, and it is impossible without the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; our undertaking must move forward; therefore, learning from the advanced experience and technology of the Soviet Union is an urgent and long-term task. Any attitude of relaxing learning and willingly falling behind must be corrected.
    The Soviet Union's Exhibition of Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction comprehensively and in detail introduces the achievements of the Soviet Union's economic and cultural construction to our people. This is the best opportunity for our people to learn from the Soviet Union. Our people should cherish this opportunity very much and visit and study seriously and wholeheartedly. We firmly believe that the holding of the Soviet Union's Exhibition of Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction in our country will further strengthen our people's confidence in building socialism and further consolidate the unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

### 学习苏联经济和文化建设的经验

    学习苏联经济和文化建设的经验
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会今天在北京开幕。我国人民以极大的热情欢迎这个展览会的举行，认为这是苏联政府和人民支援我国社会主义建设事业的又一个无私的伟大的举动。
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会有工业、农业、文化等各方面非常丰富的内容。它是苏联人民在苏联共产党和政府的领导下进行社会主义和共产主义建设的缩影。它显示了社会主义国家国民经济的高度发展和它的强大威力，显示了苏维埃文化的丰富多采和苏联人民生活的日益繁荣幸福。苏联人民的劳动成就吸引着全世界的劳动人民；对于正在努力进行社会主义建设的我国人民，这更是一课最生动的共产主义教育。
    苏联是世界上第一个伟大的社会主义国家；苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下在建设社会主义和共产主义的斗争中所取得的成就和经验，是全世界工人阶级最宝贵的财富。苏联人民在建设社会主义的斗争中，不但曾经克服了帝国主义国家的武装干涉和封锁所造成的困难，并且还必须在可以说是“空地上”和史无前例的情况下建设社会主义经济。由于这样，当时帝国主义国家曾经断言，革命的布尔什维克党和它所领导的工人阶级和劳动人民没有能力建设社会主义。但是苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下胜利地完成了建设社会主义的伟大历史任务，从而使苏联成为拥有现代化强大工业和现代化农业的最先进的国家。在这个基础上，现在苏联正继续为建设人类最美满的社会——共产主义而努力奋斗。苏联人民的这种辉煌成就为其他国家的人民走向社会主义开辟了道路。
    我国伟大的人民革命的根本目的，是在于从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫下面，最后也从资本主义的束缚和小生产制的限制下面，解放我国的生产力，使我国国民经济沿着社会主义的道路得到有计划的迅速的发展，以便提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。最近由第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过的中华人民共和国宪法规定：“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。”在中国建设社会主义这个伟大的目标，只有现在才有实现的可能。我国过去长期遭受帝国主义的掠夺和国内反动派的腐败统治，根本谈不到什么经济和文化建设；只有我国人民在取得革命胜利以后，坚决按照着苏联的道路、依靠着苏联的援助和经验，才能在短短的期间内在恢复国民经济和进行社会主义建设的工作中有了成就，使国家的面貌有了迅速的改变。在这个基础上，我国才能够在一九五三年开始实行社会主义经济建设的第一个五年计划，才能够逐步地实现着国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    苏联对于我国恢复国民经济和社会主义建设工作给予了慷慨无私的帮助。这是中国人民永志不忘的。在中华人民共和国成立之后，苏联即以优惠的条件贷款给我国，使我国经济恢复和建设工作得到了充裕的资金；大批苏联专家应邀到我国来帮助我国建设，在各项建设工作中都起了重要的作用。在我国第一个五年计划开始以后，根据中苏之间关于苏联援助中国的商谈的结果，苏联政府同意到一九五九年的期间内，在我国改建和新建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程中给予系统的经济的和技术的援助。苏联帮助我国建设的企业，从选择厂址、搜集设计基础资料、确定企业设计任务书、进行设计、供应设备、指导建筑安装和开工运转，一直到新产品的制造、无偿地供给制造新产品的技术资料等等，都是从头到尾地全面给予援助。这样伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助，是历史上的创举。这完全体现了苏联人民的伟大的国际主义精神。
    我国原是经济上和文化上都很落后的国家，实行有计划的建设，特别是工业建设，对于我们是一个完全新的课题，我们几乎完全没有经验，或者是十分缺乏经验的。因此，为了实现我国的社会主义建设，学习苏联的先进经验就是头等重要的事情。毛泽东同志在我国第一个五年计划的建设刚刚开始的一九五三年，在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会二月七日第四次会议上，又一次地号召：“我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”几年来，我国各种工作部门和企业部门的干部、技术人员和知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，在工作和生产中，广泛地展开了学习苏联先进经验的运动，并取得了显著的成效。我国的基本建设工作，从编制计划、地质勘探、设计施工，一直到掌握生产，没有不是采用了苏联的先进经验的；我国原有的企业以及扩建和新建的企业，从企业管理到技术措施也都是依靠苏联的先进经验来进行的。同样，在我国的农业生产、文化教育工作以及其他各部门工作中，也都努力学习和采用了苏联的先进经验。我国各项工作，特别是经济建设工作所取得的成就，如果离开苏联的援助和苏联的先进经验是不可想像的。
    我国绝大多数干部、技术人员和知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都是勤勤恳恳、诚心诚意地向苏联学习的；即便是过去受资产阶级的歪曲宣传影响很深的一些人，经过这几年实际生活的体会，现在对于苏联的先进经验和高度技术也不能不钦佩了。但是，在学习的态度上还有着两种不同的表现：一种是认真地学习，并把苏联的先进经验结合着我国的实际情况来作正确的运用。这是创造性的学习态度。这是正确的，是我们应该加以发扬的。另外有极少数的人虽然也愿意学习，但是又往往以苏联的先进经验和技术的水平高和自己的水平低做借口，或者埋怨客观的条件不够而不努力创造条件，借此来掩饰自己。这是一种懒惰的、害怕困难和自甘落后的思想表现。这是我们应该继续通过说服教育加以克服的。我们的建设事业是艰巨的、困难的，没有苏联的先进经验是不行的；我们的事业是必须前进的；因此学习苏联的先进经验和技术是一个迫切的和长期的任务。任何放松学习和自甘落后的态度都是必须纠正的。
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会把苏联经济和文化建设的成就全面而详尽地介绍给我国人民，这是我国人民向苏联学习的一个最好的机会。我国人民应该十分珍视这个机会，认真地、全心全意地进行参观和学习。我们深信，苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会在我国的举行必将更加坚定我国人民建设社会主义的信心，并进一步巩固中苏两国人民牢不可破的伟大友谊。
