Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 8th: The French National Assembly met on the 7th to hear a report from French Premier Mendès France on the London Nine-Power Conference agreement regarding the rearmament of West Germany, in order to conduct an inquiry and discussion on this issue.

According to Agence France-Presse, Mendès France said that the treaty establishing the "European Defense Community" was not ratified by the French parliament for two reasons: on the one hand, "the weight of supranational power was too heavy in the institutions stipulated by the European Defense Community treaty; on the other hand, Britain did not participate in this treaty," although the facts proved that the French parliament's vote reflected the desire of all levels of the French people to not allow any form of German threat to rise again.

Mendès France insisted that the rearmament of West Germany was "inevitable." He said, "The era in which we could say that any form of German rearmament was impossible is over." Mendès France tried to prove that the London Agreement provided some effective guarantees to prevent the resurgence of the German threat. He said that one of these guarantees was "Britain's promise to keep its troops stationed on the continent," and the United States also made similar guarantees.

Mendès France also attempted to portray the situation as if Germany's rearmament would be a supervised and limited rearmament, although historical experience has shown that German militarists will seize any appropriate opportunity to undermine any guarantees they have made regarding the restriction of German rearmament. It is worth noting that Mendès France emphasized those clauses in the London Agreement that stipulated that West Germany would guarantee not to produce certain weapons, but at the same time he did not mention the clauses that left loopholes for such "restrictions."

However, Mendès France could not hide that the ultimate goal of the London Agreement was to rapidly revive German militarism. He said that, according to the London Agreement, West Germany would be absorbed into the Atlantic group, and the Atlantic group "plans to strengthen the military potential of its participating countries."

Mendès France expressed satisfaction with the positions taken by Eden and Dulles at the London Conference. He attempted to convince the National Assembly that he "had not made concessions that would harm French interests."

After Mendès France spoke, Member of Parliament Paul Reynaud spoke, after which the meeting adjourned.

    法国国民议会讨论伦敦协定
    法总理硬说武装西德不可避免
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社巴黎八日讯：法国国民议会七日开会，听取法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯关于伦敦九国会议签订的武装西德问题的协定的报告，以便就这一问题进行质询讨论。
    据法新社报道，孟戴斯—弗朗斯说，建立“欧洲防务集团”的条约没有得到法国议会批准，是由于两个原因：一方面“在欧洲防务集团条约规定的机构中，超国家的权力的分量过重，另一方面，英国没有参加这一个条约”，虽然事实证明，法国议会的表决反映了法国各阶层人民的不允许任何形式的德国威胁再起的愿望。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯硬说，武装西德是“不可避免的”。他说：“我们在这里说任何形式的武装德国都是不可能的时代已经过去了。”孟戴斯—弗朗斯力图证明，伦敦协定为防止德国威胁的再起提供了一些有效的保证。他说这些保证之一是“英国答应将它的军队留驻大陆”，美国也提出了类似的保证。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯还企图把事情说成：德国的重新武装将是受到监督和限制的武装，虽然历史经验表明，德国军国主义分子一有适当的机会就会破坏他们所承担的任何关于武装德国应受限制的保证的。值得注意的是，孟戴斯—弗朗斯着重谈到伦敦协定中这样一些条款，这些条款规定西德保证不生产某些武器，但同时他对于那些为这种“限制”留了后路的条款，却只字未提。
    然而，孟戴斯—弗朗斯无法掩饰，伦敦协定的最终目的是要迅速复活德国军国主义。他说，根据伦敦协议，西德将被吸收加入大西洋集团，而大西洋集团“计划的是加强参加国的军事潜力”。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯对艾登和杜勒斯在伦敦会议所采取的立场表示满意。他企图使国民议会相信，他
  “没有作损害法国利益的让步”。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯发言后，议员保罗·雷诺发言，他发言后，会议休会。
