Gansu Provincial Health Administration Departments Pay Attention to Utilizing the Strength of Traditional Chinese Medicine

    Health administration departments in various parts of Gansu Province are actively organizing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners to treat people of all ethnic groups, giving play to the role of TCM in the health undertaking.

    There are approximately eight thousand TCM practitioners in the cities and rural areas of various special districts and autonomous regions in Gansu Province, including over two hundred ethnic minority physicians. The majority of TCM practitioners have now been organized. According to statistics from 1953, there are 149 joint TCM clinics and 10 joint TCM and Western medicine clinics in various towns and cities. In January of this year, the Gansu Provincial TCM Outpatient Department was also established in Lanzhou. Over 50% of public health and medical institutions in various places have absorbed TCM practitioners to participate in work. The business of TCM has greatly developed.

    Since 1951, many counties and cities have also held TCM refresher courses, and over 1,240 TCM practitioners have already received further training. In 1953, a TCM refresher school was established in Lanzhou. The first group of graduates numbered 108 students, and the second group of 68 students is currently receiving further training. After further training, TCM practitioners have greatly improved their political and medical levels. In carrying out the patriotic health campaign, many TCM practitioners actively participated in this movement. TCM practitioners in Minxian, Kangxian, Chengxian, Wudu and other county towns also responded to the call of the People's Government, transferring from the cities to open practices in more remote rural areas. The Wushan County Health Workers Association also organized rural mobile medical teams and rural treatment stations, reducing the trouble of farmers traveling back and forth for medical treatment.

    In order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of TCM practitioners, the Gansu Provincial People's Government Health Department convened the Gansu Provincial TCM Representatives Conference from October 8th to 16th, which determined the following key tasks: strengthen the political education of TCM practitioners; strengthen unity between TCM and Western medicine; overcome and prevent individualism and sectarianism; correctly treat TCM academics and improve professional competence; health administration departments in various places should organize various academic discussion meetings, symposiums, and special reports on TCM and Western medicine, develop and strengthen the consultation system; organize and give play to the strength of TCM practitioners, earnestly operate joint clinics in towns and cities, and gradually absorb TCM practitioners to participate in public health and medical institutions; in rural areas, in order to make it convenient for farmers to seek medical treatment, mobilize TCM practitioners to participate in agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and in towns with more doctors, health administration departments should appropriately assist TCM practitioners to transfer to rural areas to open practices on a voluntary basis.

    甘肃各地卫生行政部门注意发挥中医力量
    甘肃省各地卫生行政部门积极组织中医为各族人民治病，发挥了中医在卫生事业中的作用。
    甘肃省各专区、自治区的城市和农村中，共有中医约八千多人，其中少数民族医师有二百多人。现在大部分中医已组织起来。根据一九五三年的统计，各城镇已有中医联合诊疗所一百四十九所，中西医联合诊疗所十处。今年一月份在兰州市还成立了甘肃省中医门诊部。各地百分之五十以上的公立卫生医疗机构吸收了中医参加工作。现在中医的业务有很大开展。
    自一九五一年以来，不少县、市还举办了中医进修班，已进修的中医有一千二百四十多人。一九五三年在兰州举办了中医进修学校，第一期毕业学员一百零八人，第二期正在进修的六十八人。中医经过进修大大提高了政治和医务水平，在开展爱国卫生运动中，不少中医积极参加了这一运动。岷县、康县、成县、武都等县城里的中医，还响应了人民政府的号召，由城市转移到较远的农村开业；武山县卫生工作者协会，并组织农忙巡回医疗队和农村治疗站，减少了农民因病就医往返跑路的麻烦。
    甘肃省人民政府卫生厅为了进一步发挥中医的积极性，在十月八日至十六日召开了甘肃省中医代表会议，确定了下列几项中心工作：加强中医的政治教育，加强中、西医之间的团结；克服和防止个人主义、宗派主义；正确地对待中医学术，提高业务水平；各地卫生行政部门要组织各种学术讨论会、座谈会和中西医学的专题报告，开展和加强会诊制度；组织发挥中医力量，在城镇中要认真办好联合诊疗所，逐步地吸收中医参加公立卫生医疗机构；在农村中为了使农民诊病方便，动员中医参加农业互助合作组织，医生较多的城镇，在自愿的基础上，卫生行政部门要适当协助中医转移到农村去开业。　（新华社）
