    ——After Watching the Italian Progressive Film "Bicycle Thieves"

    The famous Italian progressive film "Bicycle Thieves," warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people around the world, is being shown in Beijing. Huge posters of "Bicycle Thieves" have already been erected on the joyful and colorful streets of Beijing in October. The posters feature the unforgettable unemployed worker Ricci and his son Bruno, who works as a child laborer at a gas station. Behind them is the ancient and dilapidated city of Rome. It is already evening, and lights are shining from the buildings. This poor father and son stand by the roadside, looking around茫茫, not knowing where to go. Six-year-old Bruno is really tired and leans on his father. And what will Ricci, as a father, do? He can only clench his fists, his heart full of grievances and resentment, unable to find a place to vent.

    Crowded among the unemployed, Ricci has been waiting in front of the employment agency for two years. When he actually gets a job, the joy of his whole family is indescribable. He gets a job posting advertisements on the street, which requires a bicycle. Ricci originally had a bicycle, but he had already pawned it.

    Ricci and his wife Maria have to pawn all the bedsheets in their house to redeem the bicycle. Bruno gets up before dawn to clean the bicycle. Maria makes egg pancakes for her husband and son to take with them. Then the father rides the bicycle, and the son sits on the crossbar, happily going to work together. Ricci sends his son to the gas station, and then, full of energy, carries the ladder and rides his bicycle to his workplace. He is in a happy and excited mood, and he will no longer have to worry about the livelihood of his whole family.

    But when he climbs the ladder to post the first advertisement, the bicycle leaning against the wall is stolen by a thief.

    Having a bicycle means having a job. No matter what, the bicycle must be found. Ricci arranges for a few good friends to go to the used car market early the next morning to look for it. They searched all morning, but they did not get anywhere. Ricci takes his son to search in the rain, and they run into the bicycle thief, but he runs away again. They chased to the church, to the brothel, to the thief's house... and were subjected to many insults. Although the police were called, there was no evidence, and it was still not found.

    Ricci is truly at the end of his rope. He drags his tired steps and wanders on the street with his son. Many people riding bicycles drive past him. He thinks: others can steal my bicycle, can't I steal someone else's bicycle? He decided to steal a bicycle that seemed unattended, rides it and runs, but the owner chases after him, and people all over the street chase after him. He is caught.

    Ricci is pushed around, laughed at, and scolded in front of his own son. People scold him:
      "Thief! Rogue! How can you be a father! Thief! Rogue!"

    The owner lets Ricci go and releases him. Ricci cries, tears flowing, Bruno takes his father's hand, and the flow of people on the road drowns the father and son.

    Ricci's story is not unfamiliar to us, and we can all understand Ricci's tragic experiences and his dim and desperate mood. People who have come from that sinful old world, who is not familiar with many Ricci's? Or perhaps they themselves have suffered all kinds of insults and harms like Ricci. In such a cannibalistic society, Ricci's fate is the fate of all kind and law-abiding people.

    It is such a murderous social system that dominates people's destinies, making it difficult for people who rely on labor to maintain their lives to get enough to feed their families. Ricci found the bicycle thief's home, which was a family even poorer than his own. The thief's mother said wearily: "...Instead of coming here to cause trouble, why not find this poor boy something to do..." What else can he do? He once opposed Maria's fortune-telling, but when he couldn't find the bicycle, he had no choice but to go to the witch. He didn't dare to go home, Maria found him, he said: "Thank you, don't nag. I didn't dare to go home because I was afraid of listening to your nagging."

    In fact, Maria is a hardworking, decisive, and capable wife. But in a society where "poor couples are beset by a hundred misfortunes," such a wife is regarded as a "nagging" woman.

    We will never forget Ricci's son, the strong, stubborn, childish and mature Bruno. He is so young, but he already bears many burdens on his shoulders! He helps his father find the bicycle, so serious, earnest, and focused, worthy of an adult. He is very familiar with his father's bicycle. As soon as the bicycle was redeemed from the pawnshop, he found that a piece of the bicycle was broken. The father said: "Maybe it was already there." He said: "No, it wasn't there before! If it was me! I would have to talk to them and make them pay for the repair."

    Poor and difficult life makes Bruno understand adult things too early. In chasing the whereabouts of the bicycle from morning to night, his two strong legs never fell behind his father's back in the wind and rain. Even when he was anxious to urinate, he turned around and chased after hearing his father's call. When his father found the bicycle thief's house and was surrounded by a group of people, it was also thanks to Bruno who called the police to rescue his father. It is such a Bruno, only six years old, but fully equipped with the ability to adapt to such a society. This character is completely unified with the social environment described by the film's screenwriter and director. We believe that there must be such lovely and pitiful children in such a society. We are always touched by this child. His father hit him in annoyance, and he was angry, crying and walked aside, refusing to come over again. He just said: "I'm not coming over! Why did you hit me!" "You hit someone!" "I'll tell Mom everything when I get home!" Yes! Why hit him? Who taught Ricci to hit the child? In fact, Ricci already knew that he was wrong when his hand just hit his son's face, so Ricci used actions to remedy his wrong. He put clothes on for the child; He made up his mind to spend the last bit of money in his pocket to eat a full meal. He said to his son:
      "Anyway, we are destined to be poor, what's the point of living if people only suffer!"

    Even so, this meal cannot be eaten with peace of mind. When Bruno heard his father say how much this meal would cost, he was so frightened that he put down the chicken leg by his mouth. The playwright and director have reached such a condensed and subtle level in the depiction of characters and events that the audience feels the hardship of life as if they were experiencing it themselves from such meticulous arrangements.

    In the film "Bicycle Thieves," the excellent screenwriter Cesare Zavattini and director Vittorio De Sica used their extraordinary artistic means to create a scene of life that is both very simple and very real, perfectly suited to the film's colors. This is a cold and ruthless society, a slaughterhouse where the poor are slaughtered. Here, a heartbreaking story takes place. On the streets, children are beggars, playing accordions and begging passersby. Here, people are guarding against each other, ready to argue with each other at any time. Here, passersby run in a chaotic manner, shouting that people have drowned in the river... Irritation and chaos are interwoven into a true phenomenon of impoverished people under the oppression of the decadent capitalist monopoly forces.

    Since the end of the war that eliminated the dictator Mussolini, the people of Italy, the birthplace of the European Renaissance, have fallen into the clutches of American imperialism again. However, Italian realist film artists opened up the world with their bare hands. They overcame the numerous obstacles created by the Italian bourgeois film companies and the evil hands of Hollywood under conditions of economic difficulty and lack of technical equipment, and enthusiastically and faithfully depicted the lives, struggles, ideals, and hopes of the broad masses of people.

    Due to the particularly difficult conditions restricting the Italian people's film industry, excellent Italian progressive film workers have created their own unique form of expression. They try their best to get rid of the complex set decorations of the studio and move the events to be expressed to the natural environment. In this regard, they have achieved extraordinary success. The natural environment fills Italian films with a sense of reality. The actors' performances are very natural, and there is no trace of pretentiousness or falsehood. Whether it is the screenwriter, director, or actor, they are closely combined with the broad masses of suffering people. They deeply understand the suffering of the people. Their works are deeply infused with the feelings and thoughts of the people. Their films truly play the role of spokespersons for the Italian people. Therefore, they are welcomed by people all over the world.

    The achievements of Italian progressive films are also reflected in the great victory in competing with American films in the market. In Italy, American film companies appeared with the overwhelming advantage of conquerors, but the masses finally loved progressive Italian films and abandoned the backward, pornographic, and boring American films. Although this situation greatly angered the American reactionaries, they even tried to destroy the theaters showing Italian progressive films in New York. They colluded with the Vatican to carry out various malicious attacks and oppression against Italian progressive films. Thugs from fascist organizations attacked the theaters showing "Bicycle Thieves"...

    The unemployment problem is a serious problem that inevitably occurs in all decadent capitalist societies. "Bicycle Thieves" clearly points out that all evils should be attributed to the capitalist social system. People who have seen "Bicycle Thieves" will warmly sympathize with Ricci and those who are tormented by life while crowding in front of the employment agency all year round. Seeing the lovely child Bruno living such a life, parents all over the world will feel sad and will never allow their children to suffer such torture. Ricci and his family are still wandering aimlessly and living or dying in the disaster-ridden cities of Italy today. But tomorrow they will stand up, unite into a huge force, liberate themselves, defeat the enemy, and strive for a better life!

    The source of this power lies in the friendship and unity of the working class.
    "Bicycle Thieves" does not explicitly express the awakening and united resistance of the working class, but careful viewers will be able to find this underground potential force in the gathering of workers at the bottom of that large building. It is still buried at the bottom today, and tomorrow it will erupt with the sparks of revolution.

    The liberated and suffering Chinese people can particularly understand the feelings of the Italian people. As a literary and art worker, I feel it is particularly necessary to express my respect and gratitude to the outstanding Italian film workers. Their talent for depicting life, the depth and accuracy of their excellent works are precisely where we are greatly lacking. Their strong political inclination and their courage to wage fearless struggles against reactionary forces will inevitably lead them to greater victories!

    动人心弦的影片
    ——意大利进步影片“偷自行车的人”观后
  　吴祖光
    编剧：希塞·札万梯尼导演：维多留·得·西卡上海电影制片厂译制
    受到世界各地广大人民热烈欢迎的意大利著名进步影片“偷自行车的人”在北京上演了，十月北京欢乐多采的街头已经树起了“偷自行车的人”的巨幅海报。海报上画着的就是使人一见难忘的失业工人里西和他的在汽油站当童工的儿子布鲁诺。在他们背后是古老残破的罗马城市。已经是晚上了，大楼里吐出了灯光；这一对可怜的父亲和儿子，站立在路旁；四顾茫茫，不知所之。六岁的布鲁诺实在疲倦了，倚在父亲身上；而作父亲的里西又将怎么样呢？他只能攒紧了拳头，满腔的委屈和怨愤，找不到可以发泄的地方。
    拥挤在失业的人群里，里西在职业介绍所的门前守候了两年；当他居然等到了一个职业的时候，他全家的高兴真是难以形容的。他得到了一个在街头贴广告的工作，做这个工作必须要有一辆自行车。里西本来是有一辆自行车的，可是早已送进了当铺。
    里西和他的妻子玛丽亚只好把他们家里的全部床单当掉，赎回了车。布鲁诺在天还没亮的时候就起来把车擦得干干净净。玛丽亚给丈夫和儿子做了鸡蛋饼给他们带在身上。然后父亲骑着车，儿子坐在自行车的横梁上，欢欢喜喜一道上班去了。里西把儿子送到了加油站，又精神百倍地扛着梯子骑车向工作地驶去。他的心境是愉快而兴奋的，他将再不要为全家的生活发愁了。
    可是当他爬在梯子上贴第一张广告的时候，靠在墙上的自行车便被贼偷去了。
    是有了自行车，才有职业的。无论如何也得把自行车找回来。里西约了几个好朋友商量好明天一清早便到卖旧车的市场去寻找，他们找了一上午，
  一点头绪也没有。里西带着儿子在雨里寻找，碰到了偷车贼，却又给溜跑了。他们追到教堂，追到妓院，追到偷车贼的家里……受到了许多嘲骂。虽然把警察找了来，但是没有证据，还是找不到。
    里西真是没路可走了，他拖着疲乏的步子和儿子徘徊在大街上。许多骑车的人从眼前驶过，他心里想：别人能偷我的车子，我难道不能偷别人的车子？他下了决心偷了一辆看似没人照顾的车子骑上便跑，但是车主追了上来，满街的人一起追上来，他被人捉住了。
    里西当着自己的儿子面前，被人们推来搡去，被人们笑骂，人家骂他：
      “贼！流氓！还配作什么爸爸！贼！流氓！”
    车主饶了里西，把他放了。里西哭泣，流着泪，布鲁诺拉着他爸爸的手，让马路上的人流把他父子俩给淹没了。
    里西的故事对我们并不生疏，里西的悲惨遭遇和他黯淡绝望的心情我们也全能体会。从那充满着罪恶的旧世界走过来的人，谁不熟识很多的里西？或者自己就和里西一样受过种种的侮辱和损害。在那样人吃人的社会里，里西的命运就是一切善良安分的人的命运。
    就是那样杀人的社会制度主宰着人们的命运，使依靠劳力维持生活的人千辛万苦得不到一家的温饱。里西寻到了偷车贼的家里，这是一个比自己还要贫苦的家庭，偷车贼的母亲厌倦地说：“……有功夫来这儿麻烦，倒不如给我们这个穷小子找个事情哪……”他还能怎么样呢？他曾经反对玛丽亚求神问卜，但是当他找不到自行车时，他也不得已地去找了巫婆。他不敢回家去，玛丽亚找到了他，他说：“谢谢你，别唠叨了。我没有敢回家，就是怕听你的唠叨。”
    实际上玛丽亚是一个勤劳的、有决断的、能干的妻子。但是在所谓“贫贱夫妻百事哀”的社会里，这样的妻子便被看做是一个“唠叨”的女人。
    我们永远也不会忘记里西的儿子，健壮的、倔强的、稚气和成熟掺杂在一起的布鲁诺。他小小年纪，可是肩膀上已经负上了多重的担子！他帮助父亲一起寻找车子，那样的严肃、认真和专心，足顶上一个大人使唤。他非常熟悉他爸爸的车子，刚把车子从当铺里赎出来，他便发现车子上被碰坏了一块。父亲说：“说不定早就有了。”他说：“不，早没有的！要是我啊！我得跟他们说说，这修理费非得要他们赔出来”。
    贫苦艰难的生活使布鲁诺过早地懂得了成人的事情。在从早到晚去追寻自行车的下落时，他的两条健壮的小腿无论在风里雨里，一步也没有落在他父亲的后边。甚至在他急着要小便的时候，听见父亲一声叫唤，也是转身追上前去的。在父亲找到偷车贼的家里，被一群人包围起来的时候，也多亏布鲁诺把警察找来为父亲解围。就是这样的布鲁诺，只有六岁，但是完全具备了适应这样一个社会的生存能力。这个人物，和电影编导所描写的这个社会环境完全是统一的，我们相信在这样的社会一定有这样可爱可怜的孩子的。我们随时被这孩子感动着，父亲在烦躁当中打了他一下，他生气，哭着走到一边再也不肯走过来。他只是说：“我不过来！你干吗打我！”“你打人！”“我回家统统告诉妈妈！”是啊！为什么打他呢？谁教里西打孩子的呢？事实上父亲的手刚打到儿子的脸上时便已经知道是自己的不是了，因此跟着里西就用行动挽救自己的不是。他为孩子穿上衣服；横了心，决定把口袋里最后的一点钱去吃它一个饱，他对儿子说：
      “反正是穷定了，人要是活着光受罪还有个什么活头哪！”
    纵使如此，这一顿饭吃得还是不能安心的，布鲁诺听到父亲说到这顿饭要花多少钱时，吓得把口边的鸡腿都放下了。剧作家和导演对于人物和事件的刻划竟达到这样凝炼精微的高度，使观众从这样细致的安排里对生活感到如同身受的艰难。
    在“偷自行车的人”这部影片里，优秀的编剧希塞·札万梯尼和导演维多留·得·西卡用他们非凡的艺术手段，非常朴素又是非常真实地为我们布置了一片恰恰适合于这部影片的生活的色彩。这里是一个冷酷无情的社会，是穷人受宰割的屠场。这里发生的是一桩教人心酸的故事。这里的街道上儿童做了乞丐，拉着手风琴向路人乞讨。这里的人和人之间都像在戒备着，随时都会和对方争吵。这里的路人杂沓奔跑，叫嚷着河里淹死了人……烦躁和混乱交织成一幅腐朽了的资本主义垄断势力压榨下的贫苦人群的真实现象。
    从消灭掉独裁者墨索里尼的战争结束后，欧洲文艺复兴发源地的意大利的人民又落到了美帝国主义的魔爪压迫之中；但是，意大利现实主义的电影艺术家们赤手空拳打开了天下。他们在经济困难和缺乏技术设备的条件下克服了意大利资产阶级电影公司和好莱坞的魔手所造成的重重障碍，热情地忠实地描绘了广大人民的生活、斗争、理想和希望。
    由于意大利人民电影事业特殊艰苦的条件限制，优秀的意大利进步电影工作者创造了他们具有特色的表现形式；他们尽一切可能脱离开摄影场的复杂的布景装置，把要表现的事件移到自然环境中去；在这一点上他们获得了非凡的成就。自然环境使意大利影片充满了真实之感。演员的表演十分自然，找不出丝毫的做作和虚假。无论编剧、导演和演员，和广大的受苦难的人民紧紧地结合起来；他们深切地了解人民的痛苦；他们的作品深深地注入了人民的感情和思想；他们的影片真正起了意大利人民代言人的作用。也因此得到了世界各地人民的欢迎。
    意大利进步影片的成就还表现在和美国影片竞争市场得到巨大的胜利上面。在意大利，美国影片公司是以征服者的压倒优势的姿态出场的，但是群众终于喜爱进步的意大利影片，摒弃了落后的色情的无聊的美国影片。尽管这种情况大大地激怒了美国反动派，他们甚至在纽约企图捣毁上映意大利进步影片的影院。他们勾结梵蒂冈教廷对意大利进步电影加以种种恶劣的打击压迫。法西斯组织的暴徒们袭击了正在上演“偷自行车的人”的影院……
    失业问题是一切腐朽了的资本主义社会必然发生的严重问题。“偷自行车的人”明确地指出：一切的罪恶应归咎于资本主义这一万恶的社会制度。人们看过“偷自行车的人”，都会热烈地同情里西，同情那些成年累月拥挤在职业介绍所门前为生活饱受折磨的人们。看见可爱的孩子布鲁诺过着这样的生活，天下作父母的人都会心酸，决不允许自己的孩子受到这样的折磨。里西和他的一家大小今天还在意大利多灾多难的城市里彷徨无主，生死不明；但明天他们便会站立起来，团结成一个巨大的力量，解放自己，战胜敌人，争取过人的生活！
    这力量的根源就在于工人阶级的友爱团结。
  “偷自行车的人”没有明显地表现工人阶级的觉醒和团结反抗，但是细心的观众将能从那一幢大建筑物的底层的工人们的集会中找到这股地下的潜在力量；它今天还埋在底层，明天就会喷发出革命的火花。
    解放了的饱经忧患的中国人民特别能理解意大利人民的心情。作为一个文艺工作者，我格外觉得有必要提出对意大利卓越的电影工作者的尊敬和感谢。他们描绘生活的才能，他们优秀的作品的深刻性和准确性正是我们大大不足的地方。他们强烈的政治倾向，他们对反动势力进行无畏斗争的勇气必然会使他们获得更大的胜利！
