Yumen Oil Mine's drilling work for production wells had completed 80% of the annual plan by the end of September. Currently, drilling workers are actively preparing for winter construction. The number of new oil wells the mine plans to drill this year is more than seven times that of 1953. The new oil wells drilled this year have been put into production successively, and the oil flow is excellent, with an average production capacity 70% higher than that of old oil wells. The output of new wells in September accounted for more than 53% of the total monthly output.

In order to improve the drilling rate, drilling workers adopted advanced rapid drilling methods and resolutely implemented operating procedures and expert suggestions such as frequent hole surveying and inclination measurement to prevent borehole deviation and ensure good oil well quality. Drilling Team 1002 drilled four standard production wells in more than eight months. They have now started drilling their fifth oil well.

Winter has already arrived in the mining area. It snowed several times in the past few days, and the temperature dropped to minus five degrees Celsius. Drilling workers are actively implementing heat preservation and antifreeze measures to ensure that the drilling rigs can continue to drill non-stop in the coming severe winter season, so as to successfully complete and strive to overfulfill the state plan for the fourth quarter.

    玉门油矿今年新凿油井生产情况很好
    钻井工人正积极进行冬季施工的准备工作
    玉门油矿生产井的钻进工作，到九月底止已完成全年计划的百分之八十，目前钻井工人正积极进行冬季施工的准备工作。今年该矿计划钻凿的新油井，等于一九五三年钻凿新油井的七倍多。今年已钻凿的新油井陆续投入生产后，喷油情况都很好，生产能力平均高出旧油井百分之七十。九月份新井生产量占了全月总产量的百分之五十三强。
    为了提高钻进率，钻井工人们采用了先进的快速钻进法，并坚决贯彻了勤划眼，勤测斜等项操作规程和专家建议，防止了井身倾斜，保证了油井质量良好。一零零二钻井队在八个多月的时间内就钻好了四口合乎标准的生产井，目前他们已开始钻第五口油井了。
    现在，冬天已经来到了矿区，前几天即数次飞雪，气温降至摄氏零下五度。钻井工人们正积极进行保温防冻措施，保证钻机能够在即将到来的严寒季节里，不停歇地继续钻进，以胜利完成并争取超额完成第四季度的国家计划。
