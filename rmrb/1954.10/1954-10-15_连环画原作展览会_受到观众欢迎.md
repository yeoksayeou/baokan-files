    "Original Comic Strip Artwork Exhibition" Welcomed by Audiences
    The "Original Comic Strip Artwork Exhibition," jointly organized by the Chinese Artists Association and the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, opened on September 26th at the Tianwang Hall in Beihai Park, Beijing. Excluding a one-day closure for National Day, it was exhibited for a total of eighteen days and closed on the afternoon of the 14th. The total number of visitors reached over 30,000, and the general feedback was positive.
    The exhibited works were selected from comic books published in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang, totaling forty-three titles and over 450 pieces, representing more than thirty artists. The content and forms of these works were relatively rich and diverse. Liu Jiyou's "Chicken Feather Letter" and "Mr. Dong Guo," the collective creation "Child Labor" by Wang Xuyang and others, and the collective creation "Zhao Baiwan" by Gu Shengyue and others, were all works that had long been circulating among the masses and were very popular with readers. Xu Yansun's "Burning of the Red Cliff," Wang Shuhui's "Peacock Flies Southeast," Wu Guangyu's "Clever Daughter-in-Law," and Zhao Hongben's "Legend of the White Snake," which depict classical literature and folk tales with traditional techniques, were also of great interest to the audience. Hua Sanchuan's "Hero Village," Wen Yongxiong's "Eliminating Pirates," and Gu Bingxin's "Blue Felt Blanket," which employ pen and ink or sketch techniques, were detailed and vivid, and were loved by readers. In general, the audience expressed that they had only seen small printed picture books in the past, and now seeing the original artwork made them feel even better than reading the books, and they believed that this kind of exhibition was very meaningful. Many readers commented that there were still too few works depicting Chairman Mao's great deeds, works depicting industrial and agricultural construction, and works depicting military life and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. This opinion is worth the attention of comic strip workers in their future work.
    Furthermore, the "Li Keran, Zhang Ding, Luo Ming Ink Sketch Exhibition" held at Yuexin Hall in Beihai Park has attracted many visitors since its opening on September 19th. Many international friends in Beijing have also visited successively and are very interested.
    This exhibition will close on the afternoon of the 15th. As of the 14th, the number of visitors has exceeded 30,000.

    “连环画原作展览会”受到观众欢迎
    中国美术家协会和人民美术出版社联合举办的
  “连环画原作展览会”，于九月二十六日在首都北海公园天王殿开幕后，除国庆节停止展出一天外，共展出了十八天，现已于十四日下午闭幕，总计参观人数达三万余人，一般反映良好。
    此次展出的作品是在北京、上海、沈阳三地出版的连环画册中选择的，共四十三种，四百五十余幅，包括三十几个作者。这些作品的内容和形式都比较丰富、多样，刘继卣的“鸡毛信”、“东郭先生”，王绪阳等的集体创作“童工”，顾生岳等的集体创作“赵百万”等，都是早已在群众中流传，很受读者欢迎的作品。徐燕荪的“火烧赤壁”，王叔晖的“孔雀东南飞”，吴光宇的“巧媳妇”，赵宏本的“白蛇传”等，以传统技法描绘古典文学和民间故事的作品，观众也很感兴趣。华三川的
  “英雄村”，温勇雄的“消灭海盗”，顾炳鑫的“蓝壁毡”等采用钢笔画或素描技法的作品，细致生动，受到读者喜爱。一般观众表示：过去只看到印得很小的画册，现在看到原作，觉得比看画册更加好看，认为这种展出很有意义。很多读者的意见是：描写毛主席伟大事迹的作品，描写工农业建设的作品，描写部队生活和抗美援朝斗争的作品，都还是太少了。这个意见是值得连环画工作者在今后工作中加以注意的。
    又讯：在北海公园悦心殿举行的“李可染、张仃、罗铭水墨写生画展览会”。于九月十九日开幕以来，连日观众很多，在北京的不少国际友人也陆续前往参观，并很感兴趣。
    这个展览会将于十五日下午闭幕，截至十四日止，观众人数已超过三万人。
