Comrades, our dear friends:

Our delegation is about to leave Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China. At this moment, we feel that we should express our deep gratitude for the great care and warm hospitality that our delegation has received during its visits everywhere.

We accept these feelings of sincere friendship and respect, and of course, we consider these feelings to be an expression of the brotherly friendship between our two great peoples. It is an expression of the unbreakable alliance between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This fruitful friendship is growing and consolidating day by day. The past five years have shown that the more consolidated our friendship and fraternal mutual assistance, the stronger the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics become, and the stronger the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism becomes.

In the five years of peaceful development, the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the long-tested Communist Party of China, has achieved truly great achievements. We have seen this everywhere we have visited in China. Now, the Chinese people are united as never before and are consolidating their people's democratic system with unfailing enthusiasm, transforming the entire life of the country on a democratic basis.

The victory achieved by the Chinese people on the road of socialist transformation is also the victory of the entire camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, because the consolidation of the People's Republic of China and the growth of its strength is also the growth of our common strength, which helps to prevent the danger of war.

We are excited and pleased to point out that during our short visit to the People's Republic of China, we have made decisions on all the issues discussed in the fullest mutual understanding, and signed agreements aimed at enhancing the welfare and happiness of the people of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, further developing and consolidating the unbreakable friendship between us, and consolidating world peace.

These agreements are based on the principles of deep mutual respect, fraternal concern, and mutual assistance. Precisely because of this, these agreements will be welcomed by the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, who build their mutual relations with other peoples on the basis of fully respecting the vital interests of these peoples.

The exchange of views we have had with each other and our fruitful joint work show that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are in complete agreement on all matters concerning our future development and on all international issues.

We are about to leave Beijing. We will continue to devote ourselves to our common cause with greater confidence: promoting the prosperity of our two countries, further developing the great friendship between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China, and strengthening the entire powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Long live the great Chinese people, our eternal, long-tested friends and brothers!

May the fraternal unity and friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—a powerful factor for world peace—forever exist and develop!

    赫鲁晓夫同志在机场上的讲话亲爱的同志们，我们亲密的朋友们：
    我们的代表团马上就要离开中华人民共和国的首都北京了，在这时候我们感到我们应该为我们代表团在各处访问时所受到的巨大关怀和热忱款待，表示深切的感谢。
    我们领受这种真诚的友爱和尊敬的感情，而且当然认为这种感情是我们两国伟大的人民之间的兄弟友情的一种表现。是中华人民共和国和苏联之间牢不可破的联盟的一种表现。这种富有成果的友谊正在一天天地增长和巩固。过去的五年说明，我们的友谊和兄弟互助愈是巩固，中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟就愈加有力，和平、民主、社会主义阵营就愈加强盛。
    在五年的和平发展当中，中华人民共和国在久经考验的中国共产党的领导之下，取得了真正伟大的成就。这一点，我们在中国各地访问时是处处看得到的。现在，中国人民空前未有地团结一致，并以永不衰竭的热情巩固自己的人民民主制度的国家，在民主的基础上改造国家的整个生活。
    中国人民在社会主义改造的道路上所取得的胜利，也就是整个和平、民主、社会主义阵营的胜利，因为中华人民共和国的巩固和它的力量的成长，也就是我们共同力量的成长，有助于制止战争的危险。
    我们兴奋而愉快地指出，在我们访问中华人民共和国的短短时间里，我们在最充分的互相谅解的情况之下，就一切讨论的问题作出了决定，并签订了目的在增进中华人民共和国和苏联两国人民的福利和幸福、进一步发展和巩固我们之间牢不可破的友谊并巩固世界和平的协议。
    这些协议的基础是互相深切地尊重、兄弟般地关怀和互相帮助的原则。正因为如此，这些协议将受到苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民的欢迎，他们把自己和他国人民之间的互相关系建筑在充分尊重这些人民的切身利益的基础上。
    我们彼此所交换的意见以及我们富有成效的共同工作说明，在有关我们将来的发展的一切问题上，在一切国际问题上，苏联和中华人民共和国双方的意见是完全一致的。
    我们就要离开北京了。我们将以更大的信心继续致力于我们共同的事业：促进我们两国繁荣、进一步发展苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国两国的伟大友谊、加强整个强大的和平民主社会主义阵营。
    我们永恒的久经考验的朋友和兄弟——伟大的中国人民万岁！
    苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民的兄弟团结和友谊——世界和平的强大因素永远存在和发展！
