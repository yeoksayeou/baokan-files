Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Since the signing of the Southeast Asia Military Treaty in Manila, the United States is further driving the Thai government to carry out arms expansion and war preparations.

    According to newspaper reports, Thai Deputy Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Nai Sarit, stated in parliament on September 23rd that large quantities of American military supplies have begun to arrive in Thailand successively in order to "equip the three armed forces." Sources revealed that the Thai authorities have recently formulated a plan to expand the Thai Navy, which is "assisted in training" by the U.S. military advisory group and equipped with U.S. "military assistance." This plan includes increasing the equipment of patrol boats, cruisers, and various modern weapons, at a total cost of 200 million baht. Sources said that the Thai authorities will also conscript young men next year to establish a marine corps.

    Under the urging of the United States, the Thai authorities are planning to force more Thai youth to serve as cannon fodder. Sources close to the Thai Ministry of Interior said that the Thai government has planned to force another 120,000 people to participate in "volunteer teams" next year. It has also been decided to recruit college students for training in jet aircraft piloting techniques. It is stipulated that eligible college students who do not participate in "volunteer team" training must be conscripted into the army.

    美国驱使泰国加紧扩军备战
    据新华社讯：东南亚军事条约在马尼拉签订以后，美国正在更加紧驱使泰国政府进行扩军备战。
    据报纸报道，泰国国防部副部长兼陆军总司令乃沙立九月二十三日在议会中表明：为了“配备三军”，大批美国军火已开始陆续运往泰国。消息透露，泰国当局最近拟订了一个由美国军事顾问团“协助训练”的、靠美国“军事援助”装备的、扩大泰国海军的计划，这个计划包括将增加巡逻艇、巡洋舰和各种现代化武器的装备等，费用共达二亿铢。消息说，泰国当局还将于明年征召壮丁，建立一支海军陆战队。
    在美国的督促下，泰国当局正计划强迫更多的泰国青年去充当炮灰。接近泰国内政部方面消息说，泰国政府已计划在明年内，再迫使十二万民众参加“志愿队”组织。另并决定招募大学生受喷气式飞机驾驶技术的训练。规定凡不参加“志愿队”训练的适龄大学生，都要应召入伍。
