The workers of the Chusovaya Steel Plant in the Urals have also achieved remarkable results in the competition. The Abramov work team of this factory, by changing the proportion of furnace materials and increasing the temperature of the blast, achieved a utilization coefficient of 0.35 for the effective volume of the blast furnace, and the productivity of the blast furnace was more than twice as high as usual. The Leningrad "Worker" Textile Factory completed its October plan ahead of schedule.

Farmers in various places are striving to complete the plan for handing over grain to the state before the festival.
