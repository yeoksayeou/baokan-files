    Chinese Dance Art Research Association Established in Beijing
    The Chinese Dance Art Research Association was officially established in the capital on the 17th. More than 30 dance workers in Beijing, including Wu Xiaobang, Dai Ailian, and Kanbarhan, attended the inauguration meeting.
    At the meeting, Wu Xiaobang, on behalf of the preparatory committee of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association, reported on the preparation process. He said: Under the vigorous support of the state, China's dance art has made certain progress. There are now more than 20 professional dance groups across the country. In addition, there are many professional and amateur dance organizations in the army, factories, rural areas, and ethnic minority areas. In order to promote the further development of the dance art, in 1953, the National Committee of the All-China Dance Workers Association decided to end the work of the association and establish the preparatory committee of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association. After more than a year of preparation, the nature and tasks of the Research Association have been determined as follows: to collect, organize, and research the Chinese dance art heritage, to carry out theoretical construction work of dance art, and to promote the creation, performance, and exchange of experience activities of dance art throughout the country. Strengthen the exchange of experience in dance art with the Soviet Union and other countries, and develop Chinese dance art. According to this task, the membership conditions are determined as: anyone who is engaged in the practice or theoretical research of dance art and has considerable experience and achievements can join. The meeting also listened to speeches by Dai Ailian, Ye Ning, Liang Lun, Zha Lie, etc., and discussed the development of Chinese dance, creation issues, and on-the-job cadre training issues raised in these speeches.
    The meeting discussed and adopted the charter of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association, announced the list of the first batch of 53 members, and elected Wu Xiaobang, Dai Ailian, Kanbarhan, Zhao Dexian, Chen Jinqing, and 12 others as directors. Wu Xiaobang was elected chairman of the board, and Dai Ailian and Hu Guogang were elected vice-chairmen. (Xinhua News Agency)
