Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 30th: The Ministry of Textile Industry recently held a national experience exchange meeting for state-owned and local state-owned knitting factories in Tianjin. This is the first meeting in China's knitting industry to exchange experiences on a national scale.

At the meeting, representatives from various enterprises exchanged advanced experiences in implementing work plans, improving the quality of knitted goods, saving raw materials, and promoting assembly line production methods. Representatives from the state-owned Shanghai Knitting Factory and Qingdao Knitting Factory introduced their successful experiences in strengthening the post-treatment process with mordants, following the directions of Soviet and East German experts, to improve the color fastness of dyed knitted goods by one to two grades. Technicians from Shanghai introduced their experiences in improving the density uniformity of grey fabrics and reducing holes in grey fabrics. If this experience is seriously promoted, it will greatly reduce the shrinkage and deformation of knitted goods after washing. The Tianjin Knitting Factory's preliminary results of trial spinning six-count yarn from sewing scraps were introduced. If this experience is promoted nationwide, it is estimated that it can save the country nearly 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn per year. The Lushun-Dalian Knitting Factory reasonably uses short remnants of fabric to make small knitted daily necessities. The Liaodong Knitting Factory uses tussah silk instead of six-count wool yarn, which not only saves cotton yarn but also improves product quality. Representatives from these factories introduced their experiences at the meeting. More than 100 representatives from the 22 knitting factories participating in the meeting repeatedly discussed these experiences. They extensively discussed the production and technical situations of various factories, thereby increasing their confidence in promoting these advanced experiences.

In recent years, the production of state-owned and local state-owned knitting factories across the country has developed rapidly. The total output value of the Shanghai Knitting Factory this year will increase by 283 percent compared to 1950. The total output value of the Tianjin Knitting Factory this year is more than 46 times that of 1949. Its annual production of sweaters, pants, undershirts, socks, and other products is estimated to be able to supply 70 to 80 million people. The local state-owned Lushun-Dalian Industrial Knitting Factory could only produce four types of products in 1949, but this year it has increased to 38 types.

    纺织工业部召开全国针织厂经验交流会议
    【新华社天津三十日电】　纺织工业部最近在天津召开了全国国营和地方国营针织厂经验交流会议。这是我国针织业在全国范围内交流经验的第一次会议。
    会上，各企业的代表交流了贯彻作业计划、提高针织品质量、节约原材料和推行流水作业法等先进经验。国营上海针织厂和青岛针织厂代表介绍了他们按照苏联专家和民主德国专家所指出的方向，采用固色剂加强后处理工程，使针织品所染颜色的坚牢度提高一级到二级的成功经验。上海的技术工人介绍了提高坯布扣密均匀度和减少坯布破洞的经验，这个经验如果认真推广，将能大大减少针织品落水后缩水变形的现象。天津针织厂试用缝纫下脚布条回纺六支纱已有初步结果，这个经验如果在全国范围内推广，估计一年内可以为国家节约近一万件棉纱；旅大针织厂合理运用短零料子制作小型针织日用品；辽东针织厂运用柞蚕绢丝代替六支绒纱，不仅节约棉纱，而且提高了产品质量。这些厂的代表都在会上介绍了自己的经验。参加会议的二十二个针织厂的一百多个代表对这些经验反复地进行了讨论；他们广泛地交谈了各厂的生产和技术情况，因而增加了推行这些先进经验的信心。
    这几年来，全国国营和地方国营针织厂的生产发展很快。上海针织厂今年的生产总值要比一九五零年增加百分之二百八十三；天津针织厂今年的生产总值等于一九四九年的四十六倍多，它一年生产的绒衣、绒裤、汗衫、袜子等产品，估计可以供应七千万到八千万人。地方国营旅大实业针织厂在一九四九年只能生产四种产品，今年已增加到三十八种。
