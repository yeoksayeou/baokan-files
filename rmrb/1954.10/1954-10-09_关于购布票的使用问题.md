    On the Use of Cloth Ration Coupons

    Since the promulgation of the order on the planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth, this newspaper has received many letters from readers expressing their warm support. Readers pointed out that this is a necessary measure to regulate the contradiction that the growth rate of cotton and cotton cloth production cannot keep up with the growth rate of demand. It is of great significance for ensuring the supply of people's necessary clothing, consolidating price stability, and ensuring the smooth progress of national construction, and it is entirely in line with the fundamental interests of the people. At the same time, a few readers have reflected that they do not fully understand the specific methods for implementing the planned supply, especially the use of cloth ration coupons. Here is a brief reply:

    (1)
    Some people ask how the scope and duration of use of cloth ration coupons are regulated? Can they freely choose colors, varieties, and quality? Can cloth ration coupons be borrowed or given to each other?

    According to the regulations of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the implementation of planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth: After the implementation of planned supply of cotton cloth, all cotton cloth and cotton cloth replicas included in the planned supply scope of the Central Ministry of Commerce must be purchased with coupons. Therefore, after receiving the cloth ration coupons, everyone should keep them properly and not lose or damage them, and prepare to purchase cotton cloth with the coupons when needed. Of course, if the actual amount of cotton cloth needed throughout the year is less than the limit specified by the cloth ration coupons, you can buy less, which will save the country the consumption of cotton cloth and reduce your own expenses, which is worth encouraging.

    According to the principle of regional supply, cloth ration coupons are issued by county and city as the unit of calculation; in order to take care of the habits of the masses going to the city or the market, cloth ration coupons can be used throughout the province (city), and can also be used in markets in the border areas of the two provinces. Anyone who goes to another place for more than a month due to business can present a certificate to exchange for coupons at the temporary residence to purchase cotton cloth or cotton cloth replicas needed temporarily.

    Cloth ration coupons are issued in two phases: the first phase is from September 1954 to February 1955, and the second phase is from March to August 1955. In order to take care of the people's use of cloth in winter, the supply quantity in the first phase is larger, and the supply quantity in the second phase is smaller. The first phase of cloth ration coupons can be used in the second phase, but the second phase of cloth ration coupons cannot be used in advance. This allows consumers to adjust and plan according to their needs throughout the year, and avoids the possibility of the first phase supply quantity being too concentrated and not adapting to production.

    Consumers can use the cloth ration coupons to freely choose various colors, varieties, and quality of cotton cloth according to their needs and wishes, and decide the quantity of cloth to buy within the limit specified by the cloth ration coupons. If the actual purchase amount is less than the limit of the cloth ration coupons, they can get back zero-amount cloth ration coupons equal to the difference.

    Among consumers, cloth ration coupons can be given or borrowed from each other in order to solve the difficulties of a few people who feel that the amount of cloth is insufficient due to special circumstances by means of social adjustment. However, buying and selling cloth ration coupons is not allowed, and fraudulently obtaining cloth ration coupons to engage in speculative activities is an illegal act that undermines the planned supply of cotton cloth. Local people's governments should strengthen management and strictly prohibit the above-mentioned illegal acts; the broad masses of the people should also actively assist the people's government to prevent all phenomena that undermine the planned supply of cotton cloth.

    Some people believe that the implementation of the planned supply of cotton cloth must be because the supply of cotton cloth has decreased compared to before. Some people also say that the current cotton cloth ration is not enough to wear. We believe that this statement is incorrect. Although the implementation of planned supply of cotton cloth will tighten some excessively high consumption that exceeds the current level of production development, on the whole, it does not reduce general consumption, but rather maintains a certain level of people's cotton cloth consumption through planned supply to ensure the people's necessary clothing. The supply standard currently stipulated by the government is not only much higher than the consumption before liberation, but also higher than any year since liberation. For example, in the year with the most cotton cloth production before liberation, each person could only be allocated 13 feet of machine-woven cloth on average. Due to the development of production, each person could be allocated more than 23 feet on average in 1953. This year, it is estimated that the average supply of cloth to the people of the whole country is still above 23 feet per person. Such a large amount of cloth can guarantee the basic needs of the people of the whole country through the planned adjustment and distribution by the state. With the development of production, the quota of the planned supply of cotton cloth will gradually increase in the future. Moreover, the current cotton cloth quota distribution is not a comprehensive and strict quota distribution. In fact, only some varieties are subject to quota distribution. For example, people with high purchasing power can still freely purchase silk fabrics, wool fabrics, and linen fabrics; in addition, the government also provides necessary care for the people's various special needs, such as childbirth, marriage, death, and disaster relief, under the principle of thrift. Therefore, the claim that the cotton cloth supply quota is too small is unfounded. The amount of the cotton cloth planned supply quota is determined according to different regions, different climates, different cloth-use habits, and different levels of purchasing power, as well as the principle of appropriately increasing rural supply and reducing urban consumption. Any simple equalitarian approach will inevitably lead to a considerable number of people feeling that the quota is too high and the cotton cloth cannot be used up, while another part of the people will feel that the supply is not enough. The cotton cloth quotas stipulated in various places are basically reasonable and sufficient; the problem lies in whether consumers carefully plan and arrange the use according to the principle of thrift. If consumers cannot plan and arrange well and use the quota of cloth in inappropriate places, it will naturally not be enough.

### 关于购布票的使用问题

专栏：答读者问

    关于购布票的使用问题
    关于实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的命令公布以后，本报收到不少读者来信表示热烈拥护。读者指出，这是调节棉花、棉布生产增长的速度赶不上需要增长的速度这个矛盾的必要措施之一，对保证人民必要衣着的供应、巩固物价的稳定和保障国家建设的顺利进行有着重要的意义，是完全符合人民根本利益的。同时，有少数读者反映对实施计划供应的具体办法不完全了解，特别对购布票的使用问题还不甚清楚。现简复如下：
    （一）
    有人问购布票的使用范围和期限是怎样规定的？是否可以自由选择花色、品种和质量？购布票是否可以互相借用或赠送？
    根据中央人民政府政务院关于实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的规定：在实施棉布计划供应以后，所有列入中央商业部计划供应范围的棉布及棉布复制品一律须凭证购买。因此，大家在领到购布票后，应该妥善地保存起来，不要丢失或损毁，准备需用时凭票购买棉布。当然，如果全年实际需要的棉布量少于购布票的规定的限量，就可以少买一些，这样既给国家节约了棉布的消耗，又减少了自己的支出，是值得鼓励的。
    按照分区供应的原则，购布票以县、市为计算发票单位；为了照顾群众进城、赶集等习惯，购布票可以在本省（市）范围内通用，还可以在两省接壤地区的集市上使用。凡因事到外地一个月以上的人，可以提出证件在临时居住地点换票购买临时需要的棉布或棉布复制品。
    购布票分两期发给：第一期从一九五四年九月至一九五五年二月，第二期从一九五五年三月至八月。为了照顾人民冬季用布，第一期供应数量较多，第二期供应数量较少。第一期购布票在第二期可以通用，但第二期布票不能提前使用。这样，既使消费者可以在全年内根据自己的需要来调剂统筹，又避免了可能发生第一期供应数量过于集中而与生产不能适应的情况。
    消费者拿了购布票可以根据自己的需要和意愿任意选购各种花色、品种和质量的棉布，并在购布票规定的限量内决定买布的数量。如果实际购买数小于购布票的限量，可以找回相等于差额的零额购布票。
    在消费者之间，购布票可以彼此赠送或借用，以便用社会调剂的办法来解决少数人因特殊情况而感到用布量不足的困难。但是，买卖购布票是不能允许的，骗取购布票来进行投机活动更是破坏棉布计划供应的非法行为。各地人民政府应该加强管理，严禁上述不法行为；广大人民群众也应该积极协助人民政府来防止一切破坏棉布计划供应的现象。
    （二）
    有人认为，实行棉布计划供应，一定因为棉布的供应量比以前减少了。也有人说现在的棉布定量不够穿用了。我们认为这种说法是不对的。实行棉布的计划供应，虽然要紧缩一些过高的，超过当前生产发展水平的消费，但整个来说，并不缩减一般的消费，而是要通过计划供应使人民的棉布消费保持一定的水平，以保证人民必要的衣着。现在政府规定的供应标准不仅比解放前的消费量高得多，而且要比解放以来的任何一年也要高。如解放前棉布生产最多的一年，平均每人也只能分配到机织布十三尺，由于生产的发展，一九五三年平均每人能分配到二十三尺多，今年预计供应全国人民的用布平均每人仍在二十三尺以上，这么多的布由国家有计划的调剂和分配，就能保证全国人民的基本需要，随着生产的发展，今后棉布计划供应的定量还会逐步地提高。况且目前采用的棉布定量分配还不是全面的严格的定量分配，实际上只是一部分品种实行定量分配。如购买力高的人还可以自由购买丝织品、毛织品、麻织品；此外，对人民的各种特殊需要，如新生、结婚、死亡、灾害等用布，政府也在节约的原则下给以必要的照顾。所以怀疑棉布供应定量太少的说法是没有根据的。棉布计划供应的定量的多少是根据不同地区，不同气候，不同的用布习惯和不同的购买力水平等情况以及适当增加农村供应和少增城市消费的原则来决定的。任何简单的平均主义的作法必然会有相当一部分人觉得定量太高，棉布用不完，而另一部分人又会感到供应不够。各地所规定的棉布定量是基本合理的，也是够用的；问题在于消费者是否根据节约的原则精打细算地安排使用，如果消费者不能很好地计划安排，把定量布匹用到不当用的地方，自然就会不够用了。
