Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Shandong Province, one of China's major wheat-producing areas, has basically completed the planting of 62.5 million mu of winter wheat. As of October 22nd, all areas except lake and swamp regions in the Jining and Heze Special Districts have completed the planting plan in accordance with national requirements.

    When planting winter wheat, farmers in various regions have carried out deep plowing, close planting, prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests, and the selection of fine varieties according to local conditions. This year, about 70% of the wheat fields in the province have adopted local fine varieties. These varieties generally yield more than 10% more than the original wheat varieties. In the western plains of Shandong, based on the large-scale supply of new-style walking plows and double-wheeled double-furrow plows to farmers by the state, wheat fields plowed more than five inches deep this year account for 30% of the total wheat field area.

    Xinhua News Agency Report: Farmers in Rehe Province are actively engaged in autumn plowing in conjunction with the autumn harvest. As of mid-October, more than 1.35 million mu have been plowed. At present, all crops in the province have been harvested, and autumn plowing is in full swing.

    During the autumn plowing, more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives have led farmers to plow carefully and early, making this year's autumn plowing operation in the province more timely and meticulous than in previous years. More than 2,200 original agricultural production cooperatives rationally organized manpower and animal power and formulated autumn plowing plans before the autumn harvest. The advanced agricultural production cooperative in Gaozhangzi Village, Lingyuan County, divided into four groups for dividing, hauling, threshing, and plowing, carrying out plowing as they harvest, and plans to plow all the arable land in the cooperative before the ground freezes. In Chengde County, many agricultural production cooperatives have plowed about one inch deeper than last year in the already plowed land. Many mutual aid teams and individual farmers, under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, have also carried out autumn plowing in a timely manner to strive for a good harvest next year.

    Xinhua News Agency Report: Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various parts of Liaoning Province have begun plowing. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Yi County have plowed more than 5,800 hectares (each hectare is equal to 15 mu). Xianfeng and Liming agricultural production cooperatives and some mutual aid teams in the fifth district of Jin County have plowed more than 300 hectares.

    This autumn, agricultural technology extension stations in various parts of Liaoning Province are actively helping agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams expand the area of plowing by helping them solve specific difficulties. The Third Agricultural Technology Extension Station of Beizhen County helped the Patriotic Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songtai Village arrange autumn harvesting work and schedule tasks before the autumn harvest, solving the difficulties of insufficient manpower and animal power during autumn plowing. The Tenth Agricultural Technology Extension Station of Suizhong County trained drivers of animal-drawn farm implements from 26 agricultural production cooperatives in early September, which not only solved the technical problems of autumn plowing, but also enabled the 26 agricultural production cooperatives to expand their plowing area. The quality of the land helped by the agricultural technology extension stations to plow is also very good, not only deeper than in previous years, but also very meticulous.

    山东六千多万亩冬小麦播种基本结束
    热河辽宁农民积极秋翻地争取明年丰收
    据新华社讯：我国主要产麦区之一的山东省，六千二百五十万亩冬小麦播种已基本结束。截至十月二十二日，全省除济宁、菏泽等专区的湖洼地区尚在继续播种外，各地都已按照国家要求全部完成播种计划。
    各地农民在播种冬小麦时，都因地制宜地进行深耕、密植、防治病虫害和选用优良品种。今年全省有百分之七十左右的麦田，采用了当地的优良品种。这些品种，一般都比原麦的小麦品种能够增产一成以上。山东西部平原地区，在国家大量供应农民新式步犁和双轮双铧犁的基础上，今年深耕五寸以上的麦田已占到麦田总面积的百分之三十。
    据新华社讯：热河省农民结合秋收积极进行秋翻。到十月中旬，已翻出一百三十五万多亩。目前全省农作物已收割完毕，秋翻工作已进入热潮。
    秋翻中，一万多个农业生产合作社带动农民细翻早翻，使这个省今年的秋翻作业比往年进行得适时而细致。二千二百多个原有农业生产合作社在秋收前就合理组织人、畜力，制订秋翻计划。凌源县高杖子村先进农业生产合作社划分割、拉、打、翻等四个组，进行随割随翻，计划在结冻前把全社可翻地全部翻完。承德县许多农业生产合作社已翻完的地都比去年深一寸左右。许多互助组和单干农民，在农业生产合作社带动下，也适时进行了秋翻，争取明年丰收。
    据新华社讯：辽宁省各地农业生产合作社和互助组开始翻地。义县的农业生产合作社和互助组，翻地面积已达五千八百多垧（每垧合十五市亩）。金县五区先锋、黎明等农业生产合作社和部分互助组已翻出土地三百多垧。
    辽宁省各地农业技术推广站，今秋为帮助农业生产合作社和互助组扩大翻地面积，积极帮助他们解决具体困难。北镇县第三农业技术推广站在秋收前帮助宋台村爱国农业生产合作社安排了秋收工作、排开了活计，解决了秋翻地时人畜力不足的困难。绥中县第十农业技术推广站，在九月初集训了二十六个农业生产合作社的马拉农具驾驶员以后，不但解决了秋翻地的技术问题，而且使二十六个农业生产合作社翻地面积都有扩大。在农业技术推广站帮助秋翻的土地，质量也都很好，不但比往年深，而且也很细致。
