Call on People to Defeat the Plan to Rearm West Germany
World Federation of Trade Unions
    The World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on the London Nine-Power Conference, calling on the working people of all countries to strengthen their unity and support the German working people's struggle against the militarization of Germany and for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.
    The statement said: The Western Nine-Power Conference in London shows that the participating countries, in violation of the will of the working people and the people of all countries, adopted a resolution to restore West German militarism. They agreed to grant the West German government the right to establish an army and air force, thus opening the way for the unlimited re-militarization of West Germany.
    The statement said: The working people of the world, especially the working people of Europe, condemn this resolution, which has the most serious consequences for the cause of peace. They have not forgotten that German militarism was one of the culprits of the First World War and should be held responsible for launching the Second World War. The European working people should not forget the painful lessons of history: German militarism harbors danger for them and for the world. They cannot agree to solve the problem of European security on the basis of rearming West Germany.
    The statement said: Giving weapons to the Bonn militarists is equivalent to giving them a tool to realize their aggressive plans, equivalent to hindering the peaceful settlement of the German unification issue, equivalent to deepening international tension, and causing countries to intensify their arms expansion, which will further lower the living standards of the working people. This means exposing Europe and the world to the terrible threat of hydrogen bombs.
    The statement said: However, the movement against the militarization of West Germany will be strengthened in the future. This movement includes an increasingly broad mass of working people belonging to various trade union systems and holding various political views, especially the communist, socialist and non-party working people of France, Italy, the Scandinavian countries, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and the labor party, communist party and non-party working people of Britain. The social democratic party, communist party and non-party working people of West Germany are also strengthening this movement.
    The statement said: There is a real solution to the issue of European collective security. The Pan-European Trade Union Conference held in Berlin in June 1954 advocated the conclusion of a Pan-European treaty to guarantee collective security. Organizing European collective security on the basis of the Pan-European treaty can eliminate any danger of German militarization and can facilitate the necessary negotiations between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in order to establish a unified and democratic Germany that can eliminate the danger of militarism revival, thereby peacefully resolving the German issue. To achieve these goals, the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working people to strengthen their unity in enterprises, strengthen their unity at home and abroad, unite all peace-loving forces in various countries, and support the German working people in their struggle against the militarization of Germany and for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. These actions will help eliminate the serious danger of world war and can make a significant contribution to easing international tensions, promoting social progress and peace.
    French Communist Party
    The French Communist Party issued a statement on the London Nine-Power Conference's resolution to arm West Germany.
    The statement first pointed out: The London Conference resolution poses a serious threat to France and the world. The purpose of this resolution is to rebuild a dangerous hotbed of war in the heart of Europe. The entry into force of the London Conference resolution actually renders the rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty meaningless.
    The statement pointed out: The London Conference resolution first and foremost meets the interests of German militarists and American warmongers, and it blatantly violates the Potsdam Agreement.
    The statement then said: Mendès-France signed the London Agreement, thereby succumbing to American pressure and Adenauer's demands. The result of "anti-communism" has once again led to the adoption of a policy of national humiliation and abandonment of national interests.
    The statement said: The diplomats who signed the London Agreement intend to have the French parliament approve the agreement as soon as possible, because these diplomats fear that all sectors of French society will oppose it. It has been suggested that the National Assembly approve the instrument of surrender signed in London on October 7. The plan of those who advocate arming the Bonn revanchists is to approve the final version of the agreement in full before the end of this year.
    The statement emphasized: However, it is still possible to reject the resolution passed in London. As long as the people act in unison, they can and must reject this resolution, just as they successfully achieved a truce in Indochina and rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty. France can successfully prevent the revival of German militarism in any form.
    The statement said: France's security and future require that the following issues be resolved through consultation: a peaceful solution to the German issue through an agreement between France, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States; the establishment of collective security including all European countries regardless of political or social system; and comprehensive and supervised disarmament in accordance with the Soviet Union's renewed proposal in the United Nations.
    The Soviet proposals and the Soviet Union's agreement to adopt the Franco-British plan as a basis for negotiations have aroused new hope among the peoples of all countries. Contrary to the London resolution, the Soviet proposals pave the way for reducing the military burden, easing international tensions, and consolidating world peace.
    The statement concluded: In the face of the renewed threat of the revival of German militarism, the French Communist Party reiterates its willingness to fight together with all political forces opposing the revival of German militarism and the representatives of these political forces, regardless of personal background or political affiliation, both nationally and in parliament.
    In factories, in urban areas, and in rural areas, communists must strive everywhere to expand the united action of the working class, especially to expand the united action of workers participating in the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, in order to stop the revival of the revanchist German "Bundeswehr" in any way.
    British Peace Committee
    The British Peace Committee issued a statement on the 4th regarding the results of the London Nine-Power Conference, saying: The British Peace Committee is scheduled to convene a General Security Conference in London on October 31, and this conference will specifically discuss how to defeat the new plan to arm West Germany.
    The statement emphasized: "Arming West Germany and establishing a military alliance threatens the security of Britain. Eden, without the consent of the British people, made a promise to keep our troops stationed on the European continent until the end of this century. This will only further deepen the threat to British security. These plans will prolong the division of Germany, exacerbate international tensions, trigger an arms race, and bring about a definite danger of war."
    British Labour Party and Trade Unionists
    On the 4th, some British Labour Party and trade union activists made speeches condemning the Nine-Power plan to arm West Germany.
    Ronald Catchpole, chairman of the Foundry Workers' Union, told reporters: "No matter how nicely it is said, the purpose of this plan is ultimately to establish a West German national army, and the establishment of a West German army means the division of Germany."
    William Paynter, chairman of the South Wales Miners' Federation, said that the members of his union were opposed to arming West Germany "no matter what guise it takes."
    Joan Mellors, a member of the Sheffield City Council, said she was convinced that ordinary Labour Party members would firmly oppose the Nine-Power plan. She said that the Labour Party parliamentary group should understand that the Labour Party annual conference did not grant it full authority to support the Nine-Power plan.

    号召人民击败重新武装西德计划
    世界工会联合会
    世界工会联合会就伦敦九国会议发表声明，号召各国劳动人民加强团结，支持德国劳动人民进行反对德国军国主义化、争取建立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国的斗争。
    声明说：在伦敦举行的西方九国会议说明，会议的参与国违背了劳动人民与各国人民的意志，通过了恢复西德军国主义的决议。他们同意授予西德政府建立军队和空军的权利。因而打开了西德无限制地重新军国主义化的道路。
    声明说：世界劳动人民、首先是欧洲的劳动人民，谴责这个对于和平事业具有最严重的后果的决议。他们没有忘记德国军国主义是第一次世界大战的祸首之一，而且应负发动第二次世界大战的罪责。欧洲劳动人民都不应忘记惨痛的历史教训：德国军国主义蕴藏着对他们和对世界的危险。他们不能答应在重新武装西德的基础上来解决欧洲安全问题。
    声明说：把武器交给波恩军国主义者，就等于交一个工具给他们去实现他们的侵略计划，等于阻挠德国统一问题的和平解决，等于加深国际紧张局势，引起各国加紧扩充军备，以致使劳动人民的生活水平更加低落。这意味着要使欧洲和全世界遭到可怖的氢弹的威胁。
    声明说：但是，反对西德军国主义化的运动在今后会日益加强，这一运动包括越来越广泛的属于各种不同工会系统、抱有各种政治见解的劳动人民群众，首先是法国、意大利、斯堪的纳维亚各国、比利时、荷兰的共产党、社会党和无党派的劳动人民，英国工党、共产党和无党派的劳动人民。西德社会民主党、共产党和无党派的劳动人民也日益加强了这一运动。
    声明说：欧洲集体安全问题是有真正的解决办法的。一九五四年六月在柏林举行的全欧工会会议曾经主张缔结保障集体安全的全欧条约。在全欧条约基础上组织欧洲集体安全可以消除德国军国主义化的任何危险，能有利于美、英、法、苏四大国进行必要谈判，以便建立一个能消除军国主义复活危险的统一民主的德国，从而和平解决德国问题。为了达到这些目的，世界工会联合会号召劳动人民加强在企业中的团结，加强在国内和国际上的团结，联合各国一切爱好和平的力量，并支持德国劳动人民进行反对德国军国主义化、争取建立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国的斗争。这些行动将有助于消除发生世界战争的严重危险，能为缓和国际局势，为社会进步和和平作出重大的贡献。
    法国共产党
    法国共产党就伦敦九国会议通过武装西德的决议发表声明。
    声明首先指出：伦敦会议的决议给法国和全世界造成了严重的威胁。这个决议的目的是要在欧洲的心脏重建危险的战争温床。伦敦会议决议生效，实际上就是使“欧洲防务集团”条约被拒绝失去了意义。
    声明指出：伦敦会议决议首先符合德国军国主义者和美国好战分子的利益，它明目张胆地破坏了波茨坦协定。
    声明接着说：孟戴斯—弗朗斯在伦敦协定上签了字，这样，他就在美国的压力和阿登纳的要求下屈膝。“反共”的结果又一次导致采取民族屈辱和放弃国家利益的政策。
    声明说：在伦敦协定上签字的外交家们打算尽快使法国议会批准这个协定，因为这些外交家害怕法国社会各界人士反对这个协定。已经建议国民议会在十月七日批准在伦敦签订的投降书了。主张武装波恩复仇主义者的那一派人的计划是：在今年年底以前批准最后拟定的协定全文。
    声明强调指出：但是，还有可能否决在伦敦通过的决议。只要人民一致行动，就能够而且一定可以使这种决议遭到拒绝，正如他们胜利地使得印度支那停战并且拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约一样。法国是能够成功地阻止以任何形式来复活德国军国主义的。
    声明说：法国的安全和前途要求必须通过协商来解决下列问题：通过法国、苏联、英国和美国的协议，来和平解决德国问题；建立不分政治制度、不分社会制度的、包括欧洲一切国家在内的集体安全；根据苏联在联合国重新提出的建议，实行全面的和有监督的裁军。
    苏联所提出的建议以及苏联同意采纳法英计划作为谈判基础的行动，在各国人民中引起了新的希望。和伦敦的决议相反，苏联的建议为减轻军事负担，为缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平开辟了道路。
    声明最后说：在再度出现了复活德国军国主义威胁的情况下，法国共产党再次表示：它愿意和反对复活德国军国主义的一切政治力量以及这些政治力量的代表，不分个人出身和政治派别，在全国和议会内共同斗争。
    在工厂、在市区、在乡村，共产党员要到处为扩大工人阶级的联合行动，特别是为扩大参加共产党和社会党的劳动者的联合行动而奋斗，以便制止以任何方式复活复仇主义的德国“国防军”。
    英国和平委员会
    英国和平委员会在四日就伦敦九国会议的结果发表声明说：英国和平委员会订于十月三十一日在伦敦召开争取普遍安全大会，这个会议将特别讨论如何击败武装西德的新计划。
    声明强调：“武装西德和建立军事同盟使得英国的安全受到威胁。艾登没有得到英国人民的同意，就许下诺言，答应到本世纪末一直把我们的军队留驻在欧洲大陆。这只会更加加深对英国安全的威胁。这些计划会使德国的分裂局面长期存在，会加剧国际紧张局势，会引起军备竞赛，并且会带来肯定的战争危险。”
    英国工党和工会人士
    四日，一些英国工党和工会运动人士发表谈话，谴责九国武装西德的计划。
    翻砂工人工会主席罗纳德·卡查索拉向报界代表说：“不管说得多么好听，这个计划的目的终归是建立西德的国家军队，而建立西德军队就意味着德国的分裂。”
    南威尔士矿工联盟主席威廉·潘恩特尔说，他那个工会的会员都反对武装西德，“不论它用的是什么幌子”。
    设菲尔德市政委员会委员琼·麦洛斯说，她深信工党普通党员会坚决反对九国计划。她说，工党议会党团应该懂得：工党年会并没有授予它支持九国计划的全权。　　　　（据新华社讯）
