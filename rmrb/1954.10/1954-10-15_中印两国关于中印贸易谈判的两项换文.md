Exchange of Notes between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of India regarding procedures for certain Chinese-made goods to be transported via India to the Tibet region of China, and regarding certain specific issues in Sino-Indian trade.

Note from Mr. Ayyangar, Representative of the Government of the Republic of India, to Mr. Kong:

(1) In the negotiations for the conclusion of a trade agreement, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of India agree to clarify, by way of an exchange of notes, the intentions of the two governments regarding Article 6 and the procedures for its implementation.

(2) Both governments are willing to maintain and develop, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, the customary trade between India and the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China.

(3) The Republic of India, in view of the need of the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China for certain commodities that are not available in India, is therefore willing to provide reasonable facilities for these commodities to be cleared through customs in Calcutta and transported to the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China, provided that these commodities are manufactured in China.

(4) Both parties agree that the customs clearance and transportation of the aforementioned commodities shall be subject to the following general procedures:

	A. To facilitate customs clearance and transportation, the Government of the People's Republic of China shall notify the Government of India in advance of the commodities it intends to transport to the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China, in order to determine whether to grant facilities for customs clearance and transportation, based on whether India can supply the commodity. Specific matters concerning the transportation of these commodities shall be discussed and resolved by the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi and the Government of India.

	B. Commodities that have been approved for customs clearance shall be declared for import to the Calcutta port customs upon import.

	C. After complying with Indian customs regulations and paying the required security deposit to the customs authorities, the commodities may be cleared through customs and sealed for transportation to the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China via agreed routes.

	D. Upon final exit, land customs officials shall inspect the commodities to ensure that the customs seals are intact, and then clear them for export to the Tibet region of the People's Republic of China.

	E. Land customs officials shall issue a customs clearance certificate upon verifying that the seals are intact.

	F. Upon receipt of this certificate, the Calcutta port customs authorities shall refund the security deposit, less the agreed-upon miscellaneous fees.

This note and your reply shall be considered an integral part of the agreement by both governments.

To Mr. Kong Yuan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China and Head of the Trade Delegation to India.

Note from Mr. Ayyangar, Representative of the Government of the Republic of India, to Mr. Kong:

In the process of negotiating the Sino-Indian trade agreement, both parties believe that issues related to inspection, quality verification, shipping, insurance, and merchant exchanges should be given practical consideration and resolution in order to better achieve the purpose of this agreement and further strengthen trade relations between the two countries. Both delegations agree that these relatively specific, rather than principle-related, issues should be left for future discussion. It is hoped that in future discussions, the two governments can reach specific solutions to encourage and promote the smooth progress of trade between the two countries.

Currently, trade between the two countries can continue on the basis of agreements between importers and exporters of both sides.

This note and your reply shall be considered an integral part of the agreement by both governments.

To Mr. Kong Yuan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China and Head of the Trade Delegation to India.
