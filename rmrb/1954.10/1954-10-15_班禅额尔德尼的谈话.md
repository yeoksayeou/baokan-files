Panchen Erdeni's Speech

    After seeing the encouraging and extremely significant news of the Sino-Soviet talks communique published in the People's Daily on October 12, I first wholeheartedly support and warmly celebrate with unparalleled excitement and gratitude.

    The significant achievements of the Sino-Soviet talks mark the further consolidation and development of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and more fully demonstrate that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is unbreakable. It will bring greater happiness and brightness to Tibet, a remote region of the motherland, and the people of all fraternal ethnic groups throughout the country. Furthermore it is a strong bulwark for defending peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, it will be supported by the people of China and the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world.

    Since liberation, the significant achievements made in all aspects of China, and the happy and warm life that the Tibetan people enjoy today in the big family of the motherland, are inseparable from the selfless assistance given to us by the Soviet Union. I express my heartfelt gratitude for this selfless assistance.

    The people of all ethnic groups in our country should unite more closely around the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, be determined to humbly learn from our great ally, the Soviet Union, and advance along the glorious path taken by the Soviet Union, and take practical actions to resolutely liberate Taiwan and build a prosperous and happy new socialist China through common struggle.

    班禅额尔德尼的谈话
    当我看到十月十二日人民日报发表的中苏会谈公报这个令人欢欣鼓舞而且具有极重大意义的胜利消息后，我首先以无比兴奋和感激的心情，竭诚的拥护与热烈庆贺。
    中苏两国会谈的重大成就标志着中苏友好同盟互助条约进一步的巩固和发展，更充分的证明了中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的，它将给祖国边远的西藏和全国各兄弟民族人民带来更大的幸福与光明，更是保卫亚洲与世界和平的坚强堡垒，因此它将受到中苏两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的拥护和支持。
    解放以来，中国各方面获得的重大成就，与西藏人民今天享受到祖国大家庭中幸福温暖的生活，是和苏联给我们无私的帮助分不开的，我对这种无私的援助表示衷心的感激。
    我们全国各族人民应更紧密的团结在伟大的中国共产党、毛主席的周围，决心向伟大的盟邦苏联虚心学习，沿着苏联所走的光荣道路前进，以实际行动为坚决解放台湾建设繁荣幸福的社会主义新中国而共同奋斗。
