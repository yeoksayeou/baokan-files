    The production of China's third automated iron smelting furnace has been good ever since it began producing iron on National Day. Up to the 17th, this furnace had produced an extra 1,293 tons of high-quality foundry pig iron for the state.

    On the third day after the furnace was put into production, its output reached the design standard. The time it took to reach the design standard was 29 days earlier than the first automated iron smelting furnace, and 8 days earlier than the second automated iron smelting furnace. From the third day onwards, the daily output of this furnace has almost always exceeded the state plan, and it set a record for the highest daily output on the 10th, 12th, and 16th, exceeding the state plan by as much as 35% at its peak. At the same time, no accidents have occurred since it was put into production. This shows that the iron smelting workers of Anshan Iron and Steel have made significant progress in mastering the production technology of automated iron smelting furnaces over the past two years.

    鞍钢第三座自动化炼铁炉生产情况很好
    我国第三座自动化炼铁炉自从国庆节开始出铁以来，生产情况一直良好。到十七日为止，这座炼铁炉已经为国家多生产了一千二百九十三吨质量很好的铸造生铁。
    这座炼铁炉投入生产后的第三天，产量就已达到了设计标准，产量达到设计标准的时间比第一座自动化炼铁炉提早了二十九天，比第二座自动化炼铁炉提早了八天。从第三天起，这座炼铁炉每天的产量差不多都超过了国家计划，并且在十、十二、十六三日创造了日产量最高纪录，最高一次超过国家计划百分之三十五。同时，从投入生产到现在，没有发生过一次事故。这说明两年多来鞍钢炼铁工人掌握自动化炼铁炉的生产技术已经有了显著的进步。　　　（新华社）
