Let More People Eat Guangdong Fruit
By Our Correspondent Ai Ling

Guangdong Province, with its subtropical climate, is not only a rich rice-producing area but also a region abundant in fruits. Guangdong produces more than a hundred kinds of fruits, among which the Chaozhou mandarin orange, banana, lychee, and pineapple are particularly famous. The Chaozhou mandarin orange is sweet and nutritious; Soviet experts and international figures consider it to be the fruit of the highest quality in the world. The lychee has been praised by many famous poets since ancient times.

A wide variety of fruit trees grow luxuriantly on the broad plains along both banks of the Pearl River. The turn of summer to autumn every year is the season for various fruits to ripen. In the summer, the lush, dense green treetops are covered with bright red lychees. In early autumn, on the slopes of the hills, purple-reddish-green pineapples reveal their large fruits from the middle of sharp, thorny leaves; a gust of hot wind brings a sweet aroma. In winter, there are still golden tangerines and oranges densely packed on the short trees. When people come to these beautiful orchards, or when they take these fresh fruits to entertain their relatives and friends, or when mothers feed fruit juice to their children's little mouths, they feel especially how lovable their motherland is and how happy their peaceful days are.

Under Oppression

During the reactionary ruling era, not many people could afford to eat these fresh fruits; even the locals could not easily afford to eat "noble" fruits like the Chaozhou mandarin orange. The peasants will never forget how the fruit trees planted with the blood and sweat of their ancestors were trampled and destroyed by the enemy. The lush green fruit trees and dense orchards were almost burned and cut down in the name of "preventing guerrillas" during the Japanese imperialist occupation. Under the oppression of the Japanese invaders, many peasants were unable to continue managing their fruit trees because they had no way to make a living. Some fled to other villages, and some painfully cut down their fruit trees and switched to growing coarse grains. Of the 100,000 mu of mandarin orange orchards in the Chaozhou-Shantou area, only 1,000 mu remained, and the annual output decreased from 1.5 million dan to 8,000 dan, a loss of more than 80 percent. A beautiful fruit-producing area was turned into desolate ruins full of devastation. After the Japanese imperialists were defeated, the peasants did not expect that the Kuomintang reactionary government would bring in the brutal and stingy American imperialists. American bandits wanted to occupy all commodity markets, and the fruit market was, of course, not to be abandoned. Large quantities of American "Golden Mountain Oranges," apples, grapes, and lemons poured into the Chinese fruit market. The peasants' fruits were not only subjected to the low-price compulsory purchases by local landlords and bullies but also suffered from the heavy exploitation of high handling fees from feudal fruit markets, making it impossible to compete with American fruits. As a result, they had no choice but to abandon their fruit trees or barely maintain their fruit tree operations. The fruit trees did not receive proper cultivation and nurturing, and diseases and pests spread like infectious diseases. The Chaozhou mandarin orange was affected by the yellow dragon disease, which has not been completely cured to this day, and the average tree age was reduced from fifty years to ten or eight years. Almost all the fruit trees in the province were destroyed, with a reduction in production of more than 70 percent, and prices plummeted. The peasants struggled in poverty for many years.

Withered Branches Revived

After the liberation of the whole country, the peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, turned over and took back their orchards from the landlords. In 1951, the People's Government issued loans to peasants in fruit-producing areas to purchase production tools and medicines, and called on peasants to restore and develop fruit tree production. The peasants responded to the government's call with joy and rebuilt their orchards. From then on, the withered branches gradually regained new life. Since then, many agricultural scientists, experts, and professors have gone deep into the producing areas every year to conduct investigations and research, guide peasants to improve varieties, and, in combination with the peasants' planting experience, promote advanced planting techniques and advocate scientific cultivation methods. After guidance and training, more than 30,000 peasants in the Chaozhou-Shantou area have preliminarily mastered advanced citrus planting techniques, and diseases and pests have been greatly reduced. The People's Government also advocated "fruit trees on the mountains," which would not affect grain production due to the expansion of orchards, extend the life of the trees, and turn barren mountains into orchards. The peasants welcomed this initiative. Now many peasants in mountainous and flat areas have organized mutual aid teams to collectively reclaim land on the mountains and plant a large number of pineapples, mandarin oranges, lychees, and other fruit trees. Farmers in the suburbs of Guangzhou have almost achieved "every family plants, everyone grows." Therefore, the output and acreage of various fruits have increased every year. The province's raw citrus output in 1952 increased by 102 percent compared with 1951, and in 1953 it increased by more than 44 percent compared with 1952. It is estimated that this year's output will increase by about 40 percent compared with last year. The annual increase in banana and pineapple production is also about 50 to 70 percent. This year, the total area of ​​fruit trees in Guangdong Province is more than 500,500 mu. The annual output of various fruits can reach more than 5.8 million dan (including sugarcane); equivalent to 143.23 billion yuan in Renminbi. If each farmer needs 500,000 yuan for food per year, the annual income from fruit in Guangdong is enough for the livelihood of more than 2.8 million farmers for a year.

To Distant Places

Fruits have a high degree of seasonality, and if the problem of long-distance transportation is not solved in time, it is difficult to develop fruit production. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, a large number of fruits could not be transported out, and the peasants had no choice but to let the fruits rot on the trees. The best quality pineapples on Hainan Island used to rot on the hillsides due to transportation difficulties; there were also cases of fruits rotting during transportation. Especially in the hot weather between summer and autumn, fruits are more prone to rot. If the transportation and storage are not proper, they are most likely to suffer serious losses. Therefore, in the past, in addition to the rich people in the largest cities in the country, such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Hankou, being able to eat bananas, pineapples, and other fruits from Guangdong, the broad masses of people in small and medium-sized cities could not afford to eat them. After liberation, in order to open up sales channels for Guangdong fruits and let more people eat Guangdong fruits, the Party and the People's Government actively improved the transportation and storage of fruits, added refrigeration equipment during transportation, and, with the help of Soviet experts, invited many scientific and technical workers to conduct research and experiments, and the problems of transportation and storage were initially solved.

After the difficulties of transportation and storage were initially overcome, Guangdong fruits have not only been able to cross the Yangtze River and cross the Yellow River in China, and sell to distant places such as North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and Inner Mongolia; but also cross Siberia and appear in international markets such as Moscow, Berlin, and Prague, allowing our international friends to also eat the fruits from the southernmost part of China. The sales volume of Guangdong fruits has been increasing year by year in recent years. The sales volume of domestic raw citrus: in 1952, it increased by 140 percent compared with 1951, and in 1953, it increased by more than 94 percent compared with 1952. It is estimated that this year it can increase by more than 50 percent compared with last year. The export volume of raw citrus: in 1952, it increased by 78 percent compared with 1951, and in 1953, it increased by 60 percent compared with 1952. This year, it will increase by 48 percent compared with last year. These fruits exported to foreign countries are exchanged for industrial construction equipment, which supports the country's industrial construction. For example, the total value of Chaozhou mandarin oranges and pineapples exported to the Soviet Union in the fourth quarter of last year and the first and third quarters of this year can be exchanged for 452 tractors; fruit canned food sold to the Soviet Union and East Germany can be exchanged for construction materials equivalent to 12,600 dan of fertilizer; other fruits sold from various ports can also be exchanged for tens of thousands of tons of steel.

Living Conditions Improve Year by Year

All this has brought unprecedented happy lives to the peasants in Guangdong. According to a survey of three producing areas, Panyu, Zengcheng, and Huangpu District in the suburbs of Guangzhou, the annual income of peasants planting pineapples is more than 8 billion yuan.

"Farmers have never had such a good life." This is what I heard from Chen Yinglai, the head of Machong Township in the banana-producing area, when I visited him. This peasant, who had worked as a hired laborer for 25 years in the old society, lived with his family of five in a small, dilapidated mud house, ate thin porridge and wild vegetables, and five people shared a torn quilt. Before liberation, his eldest child had never worn clothes or shoes; his second child died of illness because he had no money for treatment. His third child was born after liberation, and he is white and fat from eating well. Now they live in a spacious brick house with a floor, and there is a small garden behind the house. Chen Yinglai told me that he had never had banana or sugarcane fields. During the land reform, he was allocated more than three mu of banana fields and reclaimed more than two mu of wasteland. This year alone, he earned more than 6 million yuan from selling bananas, as well as income from grain, fish, and sugarcane. He has all the farming tools and means of production. His family can eat two meals of dry rice a day when they are not working, and there is fresh fish and vegetable soup. The quilts and clothes are all newly made. The family lives happily and harmoniously. What Chen Yinglai is not satisfied with now is that they have not yet established a production cooperative and lack banana planting techniques and experience. He said that in the future, they will adopt scientific farming methods, actively promote mutual aid teams, and organize production cooperatives as soon as possible, so that they can have high yields and exchange for more industrial materials. A life like Chen Yinglai's family is now common in the fruit-producing areas of Guangdong. With the gradual restoration and development of fruit trees in Guangdong and the gradual development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, their lives will become more and more fulfilling and happy.

    让更多的人吃到广东的水果
    本报记者  艾玲
    有着亚热带气候的广东省，不仅是一个富饶的水稻区，同时也是盛产果品的地区。广东盛产着一百多种水果，其中特别著名的是潮州柑、香蕉、荔枝和菠萝。潮州柑甜蜜而富有营养，苏联专家和国际人士都认为它是世界上最优品质的果种。荔枝自古以来就受到许多名诗人的歌颂。
    多种多样的果树，繁茂地生长在珠江两岸宽广的平原上。每年的夏秋之交，就是盛产各种水果的季节。在夏天，浓密密的绿树梢上，挂满了鲜红的荔枝。到初秋，山岗的斜坡上，紫红带绿色的菠萝从尖刺硬叶中间露出肥大的果实；热风掠过来，散发出一阵阵的甜香味。到了冬天，也还有金黄色的柑桔、橙子密集在矮树上。当人们来到这些美丽的水果园的时候，或者是拿着这些鲜果去款待自己的亲友的时候，或者是母亲把果汁喂到孩子的小嘴里去的时候，格外感到祖国的可爱、和平日子的幸福。
      在压迫下
    在反动统治时代里，没有多少人能吃得上这些鲜果；即使是本地人，也不容易吃上像潮州柑那样
  “贵族”的水果。农民永远不会忘记自己历代祖先用血汗种植下来的果树是怎样被敌人践踏破坏的。绿葱葱的果树，密密的果林，在日本帝国主义侵占的时候，却被以“防范游击队”为名而几乎烧光砍光了。在日寇的统治压迫下，许多农民因为生活无着，没法继续经营果树，有的逃亡外乡，有的忍痛砍掉果树，改种杂粮。潮汕区的十万亩柑果只剩下一千亩，年产量从一百五十万担减到八千担，损失百分之八十以上。一个美丽的水果区变成满目疮痍的荒凉废墟。日本帝国主义被打倒了，农民没想到国民党反动政府又引来了残暴贪吝的美国帝国主义者。美国强盗要占有一切商品市场，水果市场当然也不能放弃。大批美国的“金山橙”、苹果、葡萄、柠檬涌入中国水果市场。农民的水果既遭到乡间地主、土豪的贱价强买，又受着市场上封建果栏的高额手续费的重重剥削，无法和美国水果竞争，结果又只好抛弃果树，或勉强维持着果树经营。果树得不到适当的栽培和抚育，病虫害像流行性传染病似的蔓延起来。潮州柑受黄龙病的侵害，直到现在还没有彻底治好，树龄一般的由五十年减到十年八年。全省果树几乎被毁完了，减产百分之七十以上，价格一落千丈，农民在贫困的生活中挣扎了多年。
    枯萎的枝叶复活了
    全国解放了，农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下翻了身，从地主手里夺回了自己的园地。一九五一年人民政府给水果产区农民发放贷款，购买生产工具和药械，号召农民恢复和发展果树生产。农民欢天喜地地响应了政府号召，重建自己的果园。从此，枯萎的枝叶又渐渐恢复了新的生命。这以后，每年都有许多农业科学工作者、专家、教授们深入产区进行调查研究，指导农民改良品种；并结合农民的种植经验，推广先进种植技术，提倡科学耕作方法。经过指导、训练，潮汕区三万多个农民初步掌握了先进种植柑树技术，病虫害大大减少。人民政府又提倡“果树上山”，这样既不会因果园的扩大而影响粮食生产，又可使树龄延长，还可以把荒山变成果园。农民欢迎这个倡议。现在许多山区和平地的农民都组织起互助组，集体上山开荒，种植大量的菠萝、柑树、荔枝等果树。广州郊区农民几乎做到“家家都栽，人人都种”。因此，各种水果产量和果树面积每年都有增加。全省生柑一九五二年比一九五一年产量增加百分之一百零二，一九五三年又比一九五二年产量增加百分之四十四以上。估计今年比去年又增产百分之四十左右。香蕉、菠萝的每年增产量也在百分之五十到百分之七十左右。今年广东果树总面积已有五十万零五千多亩。各种水果年产量可达五百八十多万担（包括甘蔗在内）；折合人民币一万四千三百二十三亿元。如以每个农民每年口粮需五十万元计算，广东每年水果的收入就够二百八十多万个农民一年生活之用。
      到遥远的地方
    水果有高度的季节性，如果不及时解决远销的运输问题，水果的生产是很难发展的。过去，因为交通不便，大批水果运不出去，农民只好让水果烂在树上。海南岛品质最好的菠萝，因为交通困难，曾经烂在山坡上；也有过水果在运输途中腐烂了的现象。尤其是夏秋间气候较热，水果更易腐烂，如果运输保管不妥善，最容易受到严重损失。因此，过去除了在全国几个最大的城市像上海、北京、汉口等地的有钱人能吃到广东的香蕉、菠萝等水果外，中小城市的广大人民是吃不上的。解放后，党和人民政府为了给广东水果打开销路，让更多的人吃到广东水果，积极改进了水果的运输保管工作，增添了运输时的冷藏设备，并且在苏联专家的帮助下，请许多科学技术工作者研究试验，运输保管问题才初步解决了。
      运输保管的困难初步得到克服后，广东水果不仅在国内已能够越过长江、渡过黄河，行销华北、东北、西北、内蒙等等遥远的地方；并且可以跨过西伯利亚出现在莫斯科、柏林、布拉格等国际市场上，让我们的国际友人也吃到了我们中国最南方的水果。广东水果这几年来销售量逐年增加着。国内生柑的销售量：一九五二年比一九五一年增加百分之一百四十，一九五三年又比一九五二年增加百分之九十四以上，今年估计又可以比去年增加百分之五十以上。运销国外的生柑：一九五二年比一九五一年增加百分之七十八，一九五三年又比一九五二年增加百分之六十，今年又将比去年增加百分之四十八。这些运销国外的水果，换回工业建设器材，支援了国家工业建设。如去年第四季度和今年第一季、第三季对苏联输出的潮州柑、菠萝的总值，就可以换回四百五十二部拖拉机；远销到苏联和民主德国的水果罐头，便可换回相当于一万二千六百担肥田粉的建设物资；其他各口岸销出的水果，也可以换回上万吨钢材。
      生活年年有改善
      这一切，给广东农民带来了从来没有过的幸福生活。根据番禺、增城及广州市郊黄埔区三个产区调查，农民种植波萝的收入每年有八十亿余元。
    “农民的生活从来没有过这样好。”这是我访问香蕉产区麻涌乡乡长陈应来时，听到他说的一句话。这个在旧社会当了二十五年雇工的农民，一家大小五口人，过去住的是又小又破的泥屋，吃的是稀粥和野菜，五个人盖一条烂被子。解放前，他的大孩子从来没穿过衣服和鞋子；二孩子病了，因为没有钱，不治而死。三孩子是解放后生的，吃得又白又胖。现在他们住的是一间有楼的宽敞的砖房，房后面还有个小花园。陈应来告诉我，他从来没有过蕉地、蔗地，土地改革时分到了三亩多蕉地，还开了二亩多荒地。今年单卖香蕉就收入六百多万元，还有谷子、鱼、甘蔗的收入。他农具、生产资料俱全。他一家不做活时一天也可以吃两顿干饭，还有鲜鱼青菜汤。被子衣服都是新做的。一家人很愉快和睦地生活着。现在陈应来不能满足的是他们还没有成立生产合作社，还缺乏种蕉的技术和经验。他说，今后要采用科学的耕种法，要积极搞好互助组，早日组织生产合作社，那样才能有高额产量，才能换取更多的工业物资。像陈应来一家这样的生活，在广东水果产区已是普遍的了。随着广东果树的逐步恢复、发展和互助合作运动的逐步开展，他们的生活将要越来越美满、幸福。（附图片）
