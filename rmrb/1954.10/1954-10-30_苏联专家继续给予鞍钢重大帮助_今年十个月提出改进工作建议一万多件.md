    [Anshan, October 29th (By this newspaper)] Soviet experts have provided significant assistance to Anshan Iron and Steel Company's production and construction work this year. While ensuring the timely completion and smooth commissioning of projects such as the No. 2 Thin Plate Mill, No. 6 Blast Furnace, and Nos. 13 and 14 Coke Ovens, incomplete statistics show that from January to October, Soviet experts also put forward 10,419 suggestions of varying sizes for improving enterprise management, production operations, improving equipment, and adopting new technologies, playing a significant role in improving Anshan Iron and Steel's production and accelerating construction.

    In terms of production, following the Soviet experts' suggestions and under their guidance, the steelmaking plant implemented on-car casting, which, in addition to improving ingot quality and reducing ingot costs, also solved the plant's production imbalance, creating favorable conditions for large-scale rapid steelmaking. The blooming mill improved equipment such as the 24-roller mill and the main motor ventilation, which also increased product variety, improved product quality, and increased steel rolling efficiency. Since September alone, it has continuously set five new production records since operations began. Many rolling mills have adopted new technologies suggested by Soviet experts and have successfully trial-produced more than 40 new products, such as high-grade welding rod steel and No. 20 I-beams.

    This situation is even more pronounced in terms of construction. Following the Soviet experts' suggestions and under their guidance, the Electrical Installation Engineering Company used oil-soaked asbestos boards instead of electrical bakelite boards to make switchboards, saving the country 2.2 billion yuan in just six months. The Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company adopted the double-handed slurry extrusion method and mechanized construction method for industrial furnace construction, unprecedentedly increasing bricklaying efficiency, and the quality also reached Soviet standards. The Industrial Pipeline Engineering Company used asbestos cement joints instead of lead joints, which accelerated the construction speed, avoided the danger of gas explosions and lead poisoning during construction, and saved the country 2.4 billion yuan. In addition, the technical level of the Anshan Iron and Steel Black Metallurgical Design Company has generally improved under the guidance of Soviet experts, and it is now starting to design many new steel plants across the country.

    苏联专家继续给予鞍钢重大帮助
    今年十个月提出改进工作建议一万多件
    【本报鞍山二十九日电】苏联专家对鞍山钢铁公司今年的生产和建设工作，给予了很大的帮助。在保证第二薄板厂、第六号炼铁炉和十三、十四号炼焦炉等工程按期完成并顺利投入生产的同时，据不完全统计，从一月到十月，苏联专家还提出了改进企业管理、生产操作、改进设备和采用新技术等方面的大小建议一万零四百一十九件，对提高鞍钢的生产和加快建设，都起了重大的作用。
    在生产方面，根据苏联专家的建议，并在苏联专家的指导下，炼钢厂实行了车上铸锭，除提高铸锭质量、降低铸锭成本外，并解决了全厂的生产不平衡问题，为大量快速炼钢创造了有利的条件。初轧厂改进了二十四连轧机和主要马达通风等设备，也增加了产品种类，改善了产品质量，并提高了轧钢的效率，仅九月份以来，就连续创造了五次开工以来的生产新纪录。许多轧钢厂采用了苏联专家建议的新技术，先后试制成功高级焊条钢和二十号工字钢等四十多种新产品。
    在建设方面，这种情形更为显著。根据苏联专家的建议，并在苏联专家的指导下，电气安装工程公司采用油渍石绵板代替电胶木板制作配电盘，六个月内就为国家节约资金二十二亿元之多。工业筑炉工程公司采用了工业筑炉用的双手挤浆法和机械化施工法，空前地提高了砌砖效率，质量也达到了苏联标准。工业管道工程公司采用石绵水泥口代替铅口，加快了施工速度，避免了施工中瓦斯爆炸和铅中毒的危险，并为国家节约资金二十四亿元。此外，鞍钢黑色冶金设计公司根据苏联专家的建议，并在苏联专家的指导下，技术水平普遍提高，现在正为全国许多新的钢铁厂开始进行设计。
