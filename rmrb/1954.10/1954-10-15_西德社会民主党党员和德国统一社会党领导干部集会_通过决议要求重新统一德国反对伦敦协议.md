Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 13th Dispatch: According to the German News Agency (DTSCH), one hundred and sixty cadres and members of the West German Social Democratic Party held a meeting on the 9th in Leipzig with leading cadres of the German Socialist Unity Party, headed by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, Walter Ulbricht, and the Free German Trade Union Federation, to discuss the future of Germany and the German working class.

During the discussions, many Social Democratic Party members expressed concern about the threat of West German rearmament to Germany and the German working class. They welcomed the achievements of the German Democratic Republic and declared that they would spare no effort to strive for the peaceful restoration of German unity on a democratic basis.

The meeting unanimously passed a resolution stating that the primary task at present is to reunify Germany into a democratic and peace-loving country. The German working class and the German people must make a decisive contribution to this struggle. To this end, the eastern and western parts of Germany must become closer, and all-German negotiations must be held so that representatives of both parts can successfully represent the interests of the German people at future foreign ministers' conferences.

The resolution condemned the London Nine-Power Conference agreements, calling on the entire working class to refuse to contribute a penny or a person to the Western "defense" system; and calling on workers and trade union organizations to act in unison to promote the joint action of all democratic forces in Germany. Regarding the attitude of the upper leadership of the Social Democratic Party towards the London agreements, the resolution stated: It is correct that the upper leaders of the Social Democratic Party pointed out that the implementation of the London agreements would preclude the possibility of peacefully restoring German unity. However, the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Erich Ollenhauer, also stated that if a conference on restoring German unity fails, he would agree to establish a "defense force." This is contrary to the interests of the German working class and the entire German people. No matter how many negotiations are needed, the reunification of Germany must be achieved.

The resolution pointed out that Germany must never again become a springboard and battlefield for a new war. Peace can be guaranteed as long as the German working class and all peace-loving people accept and implement the proposal of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to immediately withdraw the occupying forces. Peace can be guaranteed as long as the working class and peace-loving forces take action to prevent all forms of military pacts by Western imperialists and conclude an all-European collective security treaty.

The resolution concluded: The two parties not only need to send delegations to each other, but also need to extensively exchange views on all fundamental issues, such as the status of the working class in the state, the relationship between workers and peasants, etc. This meeting shows that open joint talks can quickly lead to understanding between the working class on major issues.

    西德社会民主党党员和德国统一社会党领导干部集会
    通过决议要求重新统一德国反对伦敦协议
        【新华社十三日讯】据德意志通讯社来比锡讯：西德社会民主党一百六十名干部和党员九日在来比锡和以德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希为首的德国统一社会党和自由德国工会联合会的领导干部举行集会，讨论德国以及德国工人阶级的前途问题。
    在讨论中，许多社会民主党党员对德国以及德国工人阶级面临的西德重新武装的威胁表示忧虑。他们欢迎德意志民主共和国的成就，宣称将不怕艰难，全力争取在民主的基础上和平恢复德国统一。
    会议一致通过一项决议：认为当前的首要任务是把德国重新统一成为一个民主和爱好和平的国家。德国工人阶级和德国人民必须在这一斗争中作出决定性的贡献。为此德国的东西两个部分必须更加接近，必须举行全德谈判，以便两部分的代表在未来的外长会议上成功地代表德国人民的利益。
    决议谴责伦敦九国会议的协议，号召全体工人阶级拒绝为西方“防务”体系出一分钱，出一个人；号召工人和工会组织一致行动，以促进德国一切民主力量的联合行动。决议在谈到社会民主党上层领导对伦敦协议的态度时说：社会民主党上层领导人指出实现伦敦协议就排除了和平恢复德国统一的可能，这是正确的。但是社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔又表示，如果在举行一次关于恢复德国统一的会议失败后，他同意建立一支“国防军”。这是违背德国工人阶级和全体德国人民的利益的。无论需要多少次谈判，德国的重新统一一定要实现。
    决议指出，德国决不能再一次地变成新战争的跳板和战场。只要德国工人阶级和全体爱好和平的人民接受并且实现苏联外交部长莫洛托夫关于立刻撤退占领军的建议，和平是可以保证的。只要工人阶级和爱好和平的力量用行动阻止西方帝国主义者的各种形式的军事公约，缔结一个全欧的集体安全公约，和平是能够保证的。
    决议最后说：两党不仅需要互派代表团，而且也需要在一切基本问题上，如工人阶级在国家中的地位、工人和农民的关系等问题上广泛地交换意见。这一次会议表明，公开的联合会谈可以迅速地导致工人阶级在重大问题上的谅解。
