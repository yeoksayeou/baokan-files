    Donbas Impressions (Part 1)
    —Notes from a Visit to Ukraine
    By Our Reporter Li He
    Grey pyramids, like small mountain peaks, rise from the flat land, visible from afar. They are composed of rocks extracted from the coal mines. During the day, rocks containing sulphur at the top of some of these towers emit white smoke. At night, faint flames flicker within the white smoke. We have arrived in Donbas.
    The name Donbas is very familiar to us. We know that Donbas is the largest coal mining area in the Soviet Union and has the highest level of mechanization in the world. Donbas covers an area of 23,000 square kilometres and has reserves of over 90 billion tons of coal. We know that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in its instructions on economic issues on January 17, 1929, clearly pointed out the role of Donbas in the industrialization of the Soviet state: "The industrialization of our country is closely related to the growth of the coal industry in general and especially in Donbas. Donbas is the main supplier of mineral fuels for industry and transportation, and the main supplier of coke for the metallurgical and chemical industries. Therefore, the progress of Donbas's work is a guarantee for solving the basic tasks of industrialization." We also know that Donbas developed rapidly on the basis of new technologies in the pre-war Five-Year Plans; after the war, it overcame the serious damage suffered during the war, and restored and exceeded the 1940 level on the basis of newer technologies. If we take the 1913 coal production of Donbas at 25.28 million tons as 100, then after the first Five-Year Plan, it was 178 in 1932, and now it is more than four times that amount. However, our perceptual knowledge of Donbas begins with Stalino.
    Coal mines, steel mills, coal mining machinery manufacturing plants, workers' villages, and urban areas constitute the city of Stalino, which stretches for dozens of kilometers. The mines and factories of Stalino, which have been restored and developed after the war, produce more coal, steel, and machinery than before the war. Two-thirds of Stalino's housing and all cultural institutions were destroyed during the war. The restored and newly built housing is now one and a half times that of pre-war. Stalino now has a Russian opera house, a Ukrainian drama theatre, dozens of cinemas, more than two hundred clubs, and more than two hundred libraries with a collection of over three million books. We arrived at the city's Children's Palace, which was restored in 1950, using 11.5 million rubles for construction and 9.5 million rubles for equipment. It is a favourite place for the children of miners and urban residents, with 3,750 children regularly participating in 82 recreational groups there. We strolled through the "Miner" stadium, which has 20,000 seats, in front of which is a garden. The stadium was built in 1950 at a cost of 19 million rubles. We entered the state library, which is about to start operating. The library is divided into two parts for adults and children, each with its own director. It cost 15 million rubles to build. We enjoyed the opening of the Kuibyshev district's Palace of Culture that evening. This beautiful Palace of Culture, built at a cost of six million rubles, will serve the miners of the district's four coal mines. The Palace of Culture's performance hall has 550 seats, and the spacious lounge is decorated with many excellent oil paintings.
    In Donbas, what attracts us most is the coal mines. We visited two mines. In coal mining enterprises, a trust leads several mines. A city has several or even ten or twenty trusts. Trusts are led by Kombinat (integrated enterprises). A region has a Kombinat. Kombinats are led by the Ministry of Coal Industry of the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian Republic. The government of the Ukrainian Republic established the Ministry of Steel Industry in February this year and the Ministry of Coal Industry in May this year. The former is located in Dnepropetrovsk, the center of the steel industry, and the latter is located in Stalino, the center of the coal industry. These measures are precisely to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to bring the leading bodies closer to the production areas.
    We first visited Mine No. 1, named after "Chelyuskin Man" (Chelyuskin was an Arctic explorer), led by the "Stalino Coal Mine" Trust.
    The "Chelyuskin Man" mine began mining coal in 1913. (It was completely destroyed and flooded during the Great Patriotic War.) The miners said that recalling the heavy past of the old miners before the revolution was like a nightmare. Before the revolution, labour here was penal servitude, and miners were considered to be fallen people. All work was done manually. Injuries, illnesses, and loss of labour were common. They lived in dark houses and often went hungry. The only place to "relieve sorrow" was the tavern. Children had no opportunity to receive education. Now, this mine is working with ten "Donbas" type combined coal mining machines, as well as various machines for tunneling, transportation, etc. The coal output is twenty times that of before the revolution. Hundreds of workers have overfulfilled their production tasks, dozens of whom have already completed the Five-Year Plan and are working for 1956. In the past four years, this mine has added 11,000 square meters of housing, and hundreds of miner families have moved into comfortable homes. In recent years, miners have bought six cars, about a hundred single-person motorcycles, six hundred bicycles, and many radios. Now, 1,800 miner children are studying in middle schools, seven-year schools, and worker-youth schools. More than 120 miners participate in the club's amateur cultural troupe. Its choir and dance troupe won first place in the district competition and won the right to participate in the statewide competition.
    All working faces of the "Chelyuskin Man" mine use "Donbas" type combined coal mining machines, and adopt the advanced method of one cycle per day and night, so that production can be balanced. The miners plan to increase production by 30,000 tons more than the plan this year, and have increased production by 22,300 tons in the first half of the year. According to the mine director, Vladimir Mitrofanovich Fominov, the cyclical operation method used by this mine is that the production groups of the first two shifts are responsible for production, accounting for 85% of coal mining, and the third shift is responsible for repairs and completes the remaining work—coal mining accounting for 15%. He said that this mine is the first in the world to use the "ШБМ—一" type roadway tunnelling machine, and he recommended that we go to see this machine. One of the four drivers who first learned to master this machine, Nikolai Kupriyanovich Shcherbinovich, went down the mine with us.
    We put on the clothes of coal miners, carried oxygen canisters on our backs, held mining lamps, and went down to the mine. The mine is not deep, more than 120 meters below the horizontal plane. We passed through the roadways. The pillars of the roadways are mostly made of arched steel frames or concrete. Trams come and go on the roadways, with a trolley head pulling fifteen mine cars, each carrying one ton of coal or two tons of rock. The dispatch room here has a route map, and the lights on the map report the movement of mine cars. We turned to the place where the "ШБМ—一" type roadway tunnelling machine was working.
    Coal seams and rock layers are interwoven in coal mines. To mine coal seams, tunnelling workers need to first excavate roadways to the coal seams. Roadways are usually excavated in rock layers. In the past, the tunnelling method was to first drill holes in the rock, detonate explosives, and then erect supports and transport the rock, and the fastest progress was only 40 or 50 meters per month. This mine began using roadway tunnelling machines in November 1952. This machine was originally used for coal mining in Kuzbass, and after being modified, it is used here for tunnelling in rock. It excavates 265 meters of roadway per month. This huge machine is in front of us. The five motors it is equipped with are roaring. Its head is a disc as large as the roadway wall, with three rows of adult-sized chisel teeth on the disc. The rotating chisel teeth chisel a large pile of grey rock from the rock wall. The automatic scoop on the machine unloads the rock onto the conveyor belt at the rear of the machine. The rock flows continuously through the conveyor belt into the mine car. While the driver or co-driver is operating the machine to excavate the rock wall, three or four workers erect supports, and one worker takes care of loading the rock. The entire organization has seven people. There are three shifts working in rotation every day and night. Strong ventilation pipes are erected here, and the air circulation is very good.
    Taking advantage of the rest breaks, the tunnelling workers talked to us. They inquired with concern about the living conditions of Chinese coal miners. Driver Fomenkov, 34, graduated from a secondary technical school and received the Order of the Red Star in the Great Patriotic War. He overfulfills his production tasks and receives an average monthly salary of 3,000 rubles, and a maximum of 6,000 rubles. He said that in the tunnelling team, the driver's daily wage is stipulated to be 50 rubles, and the rest of the people are 40 rubles. Because the piece-rate wage system is implemented, every meter of additional tunnelling increases remuneration, so the monthly salary always exceeds the stipulated amount. Most of the seven people in this group are young people who have studied for seven, eight, nine, or ten years. Fifty-four-year-old Polhayev has been a miner for 29 years, has two grandchildren, and is still very strong. In addition to his salary, he also receives a pension of 510 rubles per month. Because he has worked for many years, he also receives an annual bonus equivalent to 30% of his salary at the end of each year. He himself has only studied for three years, and his three sons are all studying in middle school.
    The tunnelling team started working again. The motors of the roadway tunnelling machine roared again. It has excavated more than 3,000 meters from the beginning of work to now. Shcherbinovich, who went down the mine with us, is the section chief of this work section. Shcherbinovich grew up in a miner's family. He was growing up in the years when Donbas was undergoing technological transformation. After finishing seventh grade at the age of sixteen, he wanted to become a miner, but he was too young. Attracted by the party's slogan of mastering technology, he entered a tractor driver training class, became a tractor driver, and later entered an auto driver training class, and served as a driver on the front line during the war. After the war, he entered the coal mine, first as a fitter, and then as a co-driver of a combined coal mining machine. After the roadway tunnelling machine was sent to the mine, he and Fomenkov, who had studied aviation mechanics, Kolomoyets, who had commanded heavy tanks, and other four people were selected to be drivers. They stubbornly overcame the initial difficulties in mastering the machine and created an unprecedented speed of tunnelling in Donbas. Therefore, Shcherbinovich was elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union this spring.
    Returning to the ground from the mine, we passed by the clinic before going to the bathroom. We saw a row of test tube-like glass bottles lined up in a clean room. The nurse guided us to suck a few times with our mouths facing the bottle mouths. Our cavity and chest felt very refreshed and comfortable. It turned out that some of the bottles contained mint and some contained iodine. The nurse said that after the miners shower after work, they can come here to inhale for ten minutes. This inhalation therapy is an effective method to protect the health of miners.
    When bidding farewell to the "Chelyuskin Man" mine, the mine director Fominov repeatedly asked us to convey to any mine in our country that he is willing to conduct friendly labour competitions.

    顿巴斯见闻（上）
    ——乌克兰访问记之十一本报记者　李何
    一座座小山峰似的灰色的金字塔，冒在地平面上，老远就望见了。它们是从煤矿掏出来的岩石堆成的。白天，几处塔顶含有硫磺的岩石吐出白烟。黑夜，在这些白烟里，闪着微弱的火光。我们到了顿巴斯。
    顿巴斯的名字，我们是很熟悉的。我们知道：顿巴斯是苏联最大的和世界上采煤机械化水平最高的煤矿区。顿巴斯面积二万三千平方公里，蕴藏煤九百万万吨以上。我们知道：苏共中央在一九二九年一月十七日关于经济问题的指示中明确地指出了顿巴斯在苏联国家工业化中的作用：“我们国家的工业化，同一般的特别是顿巴斯的煤工业的增长，有最密切的联系。顿巴斯对于工业和运输业是矿物燃料的主要供给者，对于冶金工业和化学工业是焦炭的主要供给者。所以，顿巴斯工作的进展，是解决工业化基本任务的保证。”我们也知道：顿巴斯在战前几个五年计划中在新技术的基础上飞跃地发展了；在战后，克服了战争中所受的严重破坏，在更新的技术基础上恢复了并超过了一九四○年水平。如果以一九一三年顿巴斯采煤量二千五百二十八万吨为一百，那么经过了第一个五年计划，在一九三二年为一百七十八，现在为四倍以上。但是，我们对顿巴斯的感性认识，是从斯大林诺开始。
    煤矿、钢铁厂、煤矿机器制造厂、工人村、市区，构成斯大林诺市，它伸展几十公里。在战后恢复和发展了的斯大林诺的矿井和工厂，生产着比战前更多的煤、钢铁和机器。在战争中斯大林诺的三分之二的住宅和全部文化机关都被毁坏了。现在恢复和新建的住宅为战前的一倍半。斯大林诺现在有俄罗斯歌剧院、乌克兰话剧院、几十所电影院、二百多所俱乐部，二百多所图书馆，存书超过三百万册。我们到了市少年先锋宫，那是在一九五○年恢复的，用了一千一百五十万卢布建筑费和九百五十万卢布设备费。它是矿工和城市居民的儿童喜欢的去处，经常有三千七百五十个儿童参加那里的八十二个文娱小组活动。我们散步在“矿工”运动场上，它有二万座位，前面是一片花园。运动场是在一九五○年花费了一千九百万卢布建成的。我们进了快要开始工作的州立图书馆。图书馆内分成年人和儿童两个部分，各有自己的馆长。它用了建筑费一千五百万卢布。我们欣赏了当天晚上开幕的古比雪夫区的文化宫。这座用六百万卢布造成的漂亮文化宫，将为这个区的四个煤矿的矿工服务。文化宫的演出大厅排列着五百五十个座位，宽敞的休息厅装饰着许多精彩油画。
    在顿巴斯，最吸引我们注意的是煤矿。我们访问了两个矿井。在煤矿企业中，一个托拉斯领导几个矿井。一个城市有几个甚至十个二十个托拉斯。托拉斯受康宾纳（联合企业）领导。一个州有一个康宾纳。康宾纳受苏联和乌克兰共和国煤矿工业部领导。乌克兰共和国政府在今年二月建立了钢铁工业部，在今年五月成立了煤矿工业部。前者设在钢铁工业中心第聂伯彼得罗夫斯克，后者设在煤工业中心斯大林诺。这些措施，正是实现苏共中央的指示，使领导机关更接近生产地区。
    我们先访问了“斯大林煤矿”托拉斯领导的以
  “契留斯金式的人”为名（契留斯金是北极探险家）的第一号矿井。
      “契留斯金式的人”矿井，在一九一三年就开始采煤。（在卫国战争中它曾经被全部毁坏，被引水淹没。）矿工们说：回想起革命前旧矿工的沉重的过去，像做了一场恶梦。革命前，在这里劳动是苦役，矿工被认为是沉沦的人。所有工作都是用手工。受伤、生病和丧失劳动力是常事。住的是黑暗的房子，时常挨饿。小酒铺是唯一“消愁”的地方。子女没有受教育的机会。现在，在这个矿井工作着十台“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机，以及掘进、运输等各种机器。采煤量为革命前的二十倍。几百个工人超额完成生产任务，其中几十个已经完成五年计划，为
  一九五六年工作。在最近四年中，这个矿井增加了一万一千平方公尺的住宅，几百家矿工搬进舒适的房舍。在最近几年中，矿工买了六辆小汽车、约一百辆单人摩托车、六百辆自行车、许多无线电收音机。现在，一千八百个矿工子女在中学、七年制和工人青年学校念书。一百二十多个矿工参加俱乐部的业余文工队。它的歌咏队和舞蹈队在全区比赛中占了第一位，获得了参加全州比赛的权利。
    “契留斯金式的人”矿井的各个工作面都使用“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机，采用一昼夜一循环的先进作业法，所以能够均衡地生产。矿工们计划今年超出计划增产三万吨煤，上半年就增产了二万二千三百吨。据矿井主任维拉季米尔·米特罗方诺维奇·方米诺夫说：这个矿井所采用的循环作业法，就是头两班的生产组负责生产，采煤百分之八十五，第三班负责修理，并且完成其余的工作——采煤百分之十五。他说：这个矿井是世界第一个使用
  “ШБМ——一”式巷道开凿机的，他推荐我们去看这个机器。四个最初学会掌握这个机器的司机之一，尼古莱·库普里雅诺维奇·薛尔比诺维奇，同我们一起下井去。
    我们换上煤矿工人的服装，背上氧气匣子，提着矿灯，下到矿井去。井不深，在水平面下一百二十多公尺。我们穿过巷道。巷道的支柱大部分是用拱形钢架或混凝土搭成的。巷道上来往着电车，一个电车头拉着十五个矿车，每车装一吨煤或两吨岩石。这里的调度室有路线图，图上的灯光报告矿车走动的情形。我们折到“ШБМ—一”式巷道开凿机工作的地方。
    煤矿的煤层和岩层交垒。要开采煤层，需要掘进工人先开凿通到煤层的巷道。通常在岩层开凿巷道。以前，掘进方法是先在岩上凿孔，放炸药爆破，然后架支柱和装运走岩石，每个月最快只能掘进四、五十公尺。这个矿井从一九五二年十一月开始使用巷道开凿机。这种机器原先用在库兹巴斯采煤，经过改造后用在这里开凿石岩。它每月掘进二百六十五公尺巷道。这部巨大的机器在我们面前。它所装置的五部马达咆哮着。它的头部是同巷道壁面一般大的圆盘，盘上有三行成人字的齿刀。旋转的齿刀从岩壁凿下大堆灰色的岩石。机器上的自动杓子把岩石卸装到机器尾部的输送带上去。岩石经过输送带川流不息地泻进矿车中。在司机或副司机操纵机器开凿岩壁的时候，三四个工人构搭支柱，
  一个工人照顾岩石的装载。整个组织有七个人。每昼夜有三班轮流工作。这里架着强大的通风管，空气很流通。
    利用休息的空隙，掘进工人们和我们交谈了。他们关心地询问了中国煤矿工人的生活情况。司机方孟科夫，三十四岁，中等技术学校毕业，在卫国战争中得过红星勋章。他超额完成着生产任务，平均每月得到工资三千卢布，最高时得到六千卢布。他说：在掘进组里，司机每天工资规定五十卢布，其余的人四十卢布。因为实行计件工资制度，多掘进每公尺都增加报酬，所以每月工资总是超过规定。这个组七个人中，大部分是青年人，都念过七、八、九、十年书。五十四岁的波尔哈也夫已经当了二十九年矿工，有了两个外孙子，还很强壮。他每月除了工资以外，还得五百一十卢布的养老金。因为工作多年，每年年终还得相当于工资百分之三十的年金。他自己只念过三年书，他的三个儿子都在中学学习。
    掘进组又开始工作了。巷道开凿机的马达又咆哮起来了。从开始工作到现在，它已经掘进了三千多公尺。同我们一起下井的薛尔比诺维奇就是这个工段的段长。薛尔比诺维奇生长在矿工家庭。他正是在顿巴斯进行技术改造的年份长大的。十六岁念完七年级以后，他想当矿工，但是岁数不足。为党的掌握技术的口号所吸引，他进了拖拉机手训练班，当了拖拉机手，后来又进了汽车司机训练班，战时当司机在前线服务。战后，他进了煤矿，先当钳工，后做联合采煤机的副司机。巷道开凿机送到矿井后，他和学过航空机械的方孟科夫、指挥过重型坦克的科洛莫也茨等四个人被挑选来当司机。他们顽强地克服了初期掌握机器的困难，创造了顿巴斯掘进的空前速度。因此，薛尔比诺维奇在今年春天被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。
    从矿井回到地面，走到浴室以前，路过医疗所。看到一个洁净的房间里排着一列化验器似的玻璃瓶。护士引导我们把口朝着瓶嘴吸几下。我们的—腔和胸部觉得非常清爽、舒畅。原来瓶内有的装着薄荷，有的装着碘。护士说：矿工们下工淋浴后，可以来这里吸十分钟，这种吸入疗法是保障矿工健康的一个有效方法。
    告别“契留斯金式的人”矿井的时候，矿井主任方米诺夫再三请转告我国任何一个矿井，愿意进行友谊的劳动竞赛。
