Medium-season rice has been completely harvested in the southern provinces, and yields have increased significantly compared to last year. Single-season late rice and regenerated rice are growing well and are being harvested successively.

This autumn, the broad masses of farmers launched a comprehensive movement to increase production beyond quotas. Farmers in non-disaster areas and areas less affected by floods have strengthened the late-stage field management of rice and meticulous harvesting, resulting in generally good harvests. From the harvest of over 150 million mu of mid-season rice in provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang, yields increased by about 7 percent compared to last year. In Sichuan Province, the yield of rice on 51.1 million mu was 458 jin per mu, with the total provincial rice production expected to increase by over 1.6 billion jin compared to last year. In Hunan Province, the yield of mid-season rice on 38 million mu generally increased by about 7 percent compared to last year. In Fujian Province, the total output of mid- and late-season rice on 15 million mu increased by about 9 percent compared to last year, exceeding the original planned output by 3.2 percent. In Hubei Province, in the large non-disaster areas with particularly heavy rainfall and insufficient sunlight this year, the average grain yield of mid-season rice on 3,959,000 mu was still around 400 jin.

During the autumn harvest, farmers in various regions carefully harvested and reduced field scattering to increase the actual harvest volume. Sichuan Province promoted more than 10,000 improved threshing machines. On average, the use of improved threshing machines reduced scattering by 10 to 18 jin per mu. Areas that did not use improved threshing machines also generally improved harvesting techniques. According to reports from twelve key villages in the Leshan, Mianyang, Yibin, Neijiang, Wenjiang, and Luzhou special districts, it is estimated that the average scattering loss on the province's 51.1 million mu of rice decreased by 4 to 5 jin per mu compared to previous years, potentially resulting in an additional harvest of approximately 200 million jin of rice for the entire province.

    南方各省中熟稻产量普遍增加
    南方各省的中熟稻已经全部收割完毕，产量比去年显著增加。一季晚稻和再生稻生长良好，正在陆续收割。
    今年秋天，广大农民开展了全面的超额增产运动；非灾地区和受水灾较轻地区的农民，都加强了水稻后期田间管理和细收细打工作，一般收成很好。从四川、湖南、湖北、江西、广西、安徽、浙江等省一亿五千多万亩中稻收成来看，约比去年增产百分之七左右。四川省五千一百多万亩水稻，每亩产量四百五十八斤，总计全省要比去年增产稻谷十六亿斤以上。湖南省三千八百多万亩中熟稻，一般比去年增产百分之七左右。福建省一千五百多万亩中、晚稻总产量约比去年增产百分之九，超过原计划产量百分之三点二。湖北省今年雨水特多、光照不足的大片非灾区的三百九十五万九千多亩中熟稻，平均产谷还在四百斤左右。
    在秋收中，各地农民细收细打，减少田间抛撒，提高实际收获量。四川省推广改良打谷机一万多部，一般使用改良打谷机收割的，平均每亩减少抛撒十斤到十八斤，没有使用改良打谷机的地区也普遍改进了收打技术。据乐山、绵阳、宜宾、内江、温江、泸州等专区十二个基点村的报告，估计全省五千一百多万亩水稻，平均每亩较往年减少抛撒损失四、五斤，全省约可多收稻谷约两亿斤。
