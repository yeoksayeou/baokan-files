    Fourteen agricultural production cooperatives in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, including Qianjin, Xinjian, and Rongfeng, enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state after the autumn harvest.
    With the exception of a few cooperatives that experienced reduced production due to disasters, these fourteen agricultural production cooperatives generally saw an increase in production of 20 to 30 percent this year compared to last year, with some increasing by 50 percent. Before the establishment of the Xinjian Agricultural Production Cooperative, 62 mu of land were frequently hit by drought, resulting in poor harvests. After the cooperative was established, the entire cooperative worked together to build a water channel to divert water for irrigation, ensuring a bumper harvest on the 62 mu of land. This year, the Rongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, due to unified production arrangements, freed up labor and converted a batch of dry land into paddy fields, resulting in an additional 21 shi of grain. These facts of increased production have made the cooperative members more aware of the correctness of taking the path of collectivization.
    After the autumn harvest, members of these agricultural production cooperatives, through summarizing the benefits they have received since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, have further recognized the policy of unified purchase and sale and enhanced their socialist awareness. All cooperatives are enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to the state, and have now sold more than 300,530 jin of surplus grain.

    湖北省当阳县十四个农业社踊跃出卖余粮
    湖北省当阳县前进、新建、荣丰等十四个农业生产合作社，秋收以后踊跃把余粮卖给国家。
    这十四个农业生产合作社除个别社因受灾减产外，今年一般都比去年增产百分之二十到三十，有的增产百分之五十。新建农业生产合作社建社以前，有六十二亩田经常遭到旱灾的袭击，因此收成很少；建社以后，全社合力做了一个过水槽，用来引水灌田，保证了六十二亩田的丰收。荣丰农业生产合作社今年由于统一安排生产，腾出劳动力，把一批旱田改成水田，结果多打了二十一石粮食。这些增产的事实，使社员们更加认识到走合作化道路的正确。
    秋收以后，这些农业生产合作社的社员们通过总结实行粮食统购统销后得到的好处，进一步认清了统购统销的政策，提高了社会主义觉悟。各社都踊跃把余粮卖给国家，现在已经卖出余粮三十万零五千三百多斤。
