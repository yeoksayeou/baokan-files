Farmers in Sichuan and other provinces are actively repaying overdue agricultural loans.

This spring, People's Banks in various regions issued a large number of agricultural loans, strongly supporting spring plowing and production. After the autumn harvest, farmers have been actively repaying their overdue loans. As of the end of September, farmers in Sichuan Province had repaid 55% of the planned amount to be recovered; Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces had reached about 40% of the planned recovery amount; Pingjiang and Chaling counties in Hunan Province, and Dongxiang and Jinxi counties in Jiangxi Province, have reached more than 80%. Chen Qiusu Mutual Aid Team in Shashi Township, Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, borrowed one million yuan during the spring plowing season to buy two large draft cattle, which solved the problem of insufficient livestock power at the time. Soon after the autumn harvest, they repaid the loan in three installments within five days. The agricultural production cooperative in Gao Cen Township, Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, took the lead in quickly repaying the loan, prompting the masses in the nearby Chaoyang, Huayuan, and other four villages to repay 25 million yuan in four days.

After selling surplus grain and cotton, farmers in various parts of Shaanxi Province have been actively repaying overdue agricultural loans to local People's Banks. In the third quarter, the Shaanxi Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China recovered a total of 81 billion yuan in agricultural loans.

In order to facilitate farmers' repayment of loans, People's Banks in various parts of Shaanxi Province, in addition to entrusting credit cooperatives to act as agents for loan recovery, have also established many mobile teams that go deep into the countryside to handle loan repayment procedures; temporary loan collection points have been set up in many mountainous and inconvenient transportation areas.

    四川等省农民积极归还到期农业贷款
    今春各地人民银行发放了大批农业贷款，有力地支持了春耕生产。农民们在秋收以后，纷纷归还到期贷款。截至九月底止，四川省农民归还的到期贷款，已达计划收回数的百分之五十五；湖南、江西两省达到计划收回数的百分之四十左右；湖南省平江、茶陵和江西省东乡、金溪等县，已经达到百分之八十以上。江西省永新县沙市乡陈秋苏互助组在春耕时贷款一百万元买了两头大耕牛，解决了当时畜力不足的困难；秋收后不久，他们在五天内分三次就还清了贷款。湖北省应城县高岑乡农业生产合作社带头迅速还清贷款，推动附近的朝阳、花园等四个村的群众在四天中归还贷款二千五百万元。

    陕西省各地农民在卖出余粮和棉花以后，纷纷向当地人民银行交还到期农业贷款。在第三季度内，中国人民银行陕西省分行共收回农业贷款八百一十亿元。
    陕西省各地人民银行为了便利农民归还贷款，除委托信用合作社代理收贷业务外，还成立了许多流动小组，深入乡村，办理归还贷款的手续；不少山区和交通不便地区设立了临时收贷点。
