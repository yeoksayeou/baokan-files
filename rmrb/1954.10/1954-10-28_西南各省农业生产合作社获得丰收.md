Agricultural production cooperatives established in the southwestern provinces last winter and this spring, numbering 1,538, have largely achieved an average increase in production of about 20% compared to last year. In Suining County, Sichuan, 17 cooperatives saw a 37% increase in rice production, while 8 cooperatives in Jiangjin County saw a 22.6% increase. The rate of increase in agricultural production cooperatives in various regions is higher than that of mutual aid teams and individual farmers. For example, the corn yield of the Jiefang, Luohan, Shibao, and Gaokan cooperatives in Jianyang Shehong Township, Sichuan, was 68% higher than that of ordinary mutual aid teams and about double that of individual farmers.

The reason these agricultural production cooperatives achieved increased production is mainly due to the advantages of unified management of collective production. The Qilin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Weining County, Guizhou, planted all the land suitable for potatoes with four stones of potato seeds, and harvested a total of forty-five stones of potatoes; if this land were planted with corn, it could only yield two stones and five dou, which, when calculated as corn based on the potatoes, resulted in an increase of fifteen stones of corn. The Xingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xikang generally processed the land, expanded the cultivated area, and transformed dry land into paddy fields, which played a significant role in this year's increased production. In the spring of this year, Yunnan suffered a severe drought, and the 29 agricultural production cooperatives in Chuxiong Prefecture built nearly 100 small-scale water conservancy projects, which could irrigate more than 6,000 mu of land; the cooperatives also mobilized their members to draw water to fight the drought, ensuring the smooth progress of rice transplanting.

In addition, the various forms of assistance provided by the state to cooperative farmers also played a significant role in the increased production of these cooperatives. The cotton in the Jiefang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jianyang, Sichuan, was initially severely threatened by aphids, but the government supplied more than ten sprayers and a large amount of insecticide, which ensured a bumper cotton harvest. During the drought this year, the No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Duwei Township, Nanchong City, thanks to the help of an electric pumping station, operated day and night, ensuring timely rice transplanting and converting more than 100 dan of dry land into paddy fields. An adequate supply of water was provided throughout the growth process of the rice.

The fact that agricultural production cooperatives have increased production has educated and motivated mutual aid teams and individual farmers to take the path of cooperativization. More than 3,000 mutual aid teams and many individual farmers in Qujing Prefecture, Yunnan, and Bijie Prefecture, Guizhou, are actively preparing to establish and join agricultural production cooperatives.

    西南各省农业生产合作社获得丰收
    西南各省去冬今春建立的一千五百三十八个农业生产合作社，绝大部分平均比去年增产百分之二十左右。四川遂宁县十七个社的水稻增产百分之三十七，江津县八个社增产百分之二十二点六；各地农业生产合作社的增产比率高于当地互助组和单干农民。如四川简阳射洪乡解放、罗汉、石包、高坎四社的玉米产量比一般的互助组高百分之六十八，比单干农民高一倍左右。
    这些农业生产合作社获得增产的原因，主要是发挥了集体生产统一经营的优越性。贵州威宁县麒麟农业生产合作社将全社适宜种马铃薯的地种了四石种籽的马铃薯，共收四十五石马铃薯；这些耕地如果种玉米只能收二石五斗，以马铃薯折玉米计算，共增产十五石玉米。西康星星农业生产合作社普遍进行土地加工，扩大耕地面积，变干田为水田，对今年增产有很大作用。今年春季云南旱灾严重，楚雄专区二十九个农业生产合作社共兴修小型水利工程将近一百处，可灌田六千多亩；各社并动员社员车水抗旱，保证了插秧顺利进行。
    另外，国家给合作农民的各项援助，对这些合作社的增产也起了很大作用。四川简阳解放农业生产合作社棉花开始受蚜虫威胁很大，政府供给了十多部喷雾器和大批虫药，才保证了棉花的丰收。在今年天旱时，南充市郊都尉乡第一农业生产合作社由于有电力抽水机站的帮助，日夜开车，保证了及时插秧，并将一百多挑干田改为水田。在稻谷生长过程中，充分地供应了需要的水量。
    农业生产合作社增产的事实，教育和带动了互助组和单干农民走合作化道路，云南曲靖和贵州毕节两专区就有三千多个互助组和很多单干农民积极准备建立与参加农业生产合作社。
