The Party Has Nurtured Me into an Air Force Commander
Representative to the National People's Congress
Commander of a Unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force Zheng Changhua

Five years ago, New China was founded. Just as the people of the whole country were rejoicing in the birth of their great motherland, I also embarked on a new life journey—responding to the call of the Party, and entered the gate of aviation school from the army of the People's Liberation Army. At that time, I had infinite feelings in my heart. First of all, I thought of the battle of Menglianggu in the Yimeng Mountain area of Shandong, where we encircled and annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek bandits during the Liberation War. At that time, our army was encircling Menglianggu along the mountain gullies, but enemy planes harassed and bombed us day and night, so we had to camouflage and conceal ourselves. Although the enemy planes could not save the fate of the bandits in Menglianggu from being annihilated, they did increase the difficulties of our battle. I remember some soldiers scolding contemptuously, "Don't act strangely. In a few years, let's see if you're still so rampant!" At that time, I also thought in my heart: We will definitely build an air force in the future, and maybe I will become a pilot. At that time, I must shoot down a few enemy planes and not allow the enemy to be so rampant again.

Now, this wish is really about to come true. I am a student at aviation school.

After entering aviation school, the complex science and technology, for a person like me who lacked culture and scientific knowledge, was like a rugged and majestic mountain standing in front of me. Whenever I was thinking hard about difficult problems, or when I was a little unconfident in front of difficulties, I would think of the teachings of our beloved leader Chairman Mao: "Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do. This is the difficulty. … We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we don't understand. … Delve into it, a few months, a year or two, three or five years, and we can always learn it." At the same time, I also remembered what the leader said to me when I left the army: "Mastering aviation technology is a very simple thing. In learning, you must carry forward the spirit of bravery you had in the past battles. …" From these words, I continuously received encouraging strength and overcame numerous difficulties. My confidence in learning became more and more firm. I often reviewed my lessons until late at night, and sometimes sacrificed other rest time; if I didn't understand a problem, I would first think about it myself, and if I still couldn't solve it, I would ask the teacher and classmates for advice. I remember that in order to familiarize myself with the location of various equipment in the aircraft cockpit, I often took turns with several classmates to cover my eyes, sit in the cabin, and answer the location of various instruments one by one according to everyone's questions, so that I could memorize them. In those days, my heart was completely attracted by the plane. After a very short period of time, because of my good academic performance, I received a first-class study certificate and graduated from aviation school a month early.

I was really happy when I left aviation school. I thought, I have not failed the expectations of the Party and the people. I have finally learned a technology needed by the Party and the people. In such a short period of time, I have added two wings to myself. I should use these two wings well to protect the construction cause of the motherland and the peaceful life of the people.

Not long after, when the American invaders advanced from southern Korea to the Yalu River, and a warm movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea was launched across the country, I immediately signed up to join the volunteer air force. Soon I was appointed as the air commander of a certain detachment of the air force, leading the air force to fight the enemy in the sky of Korea.

In aerial combat, I was still a recruit, and air command was even more unfamiliar to me. Once, when the Party committee was studying the battle situation, the political commissar said to me: "As an air commander, you must be good at summarizing everyone's combat experience, concentrating everyone's wisdom, and then using it to guide everyone's actions. You must remember that the bravery and wisdom of the pilots must be reflected and exerted in combat through your correct command." The political commissar's words gave me great inspiration.

In those tense battle days, while leading the troops in combat, I actively studied tactics by using every gap. Based on the combat missions, combined with the enemy's activity patterns, characteristics, and personal experiences, the pilots put forward many opinions on improving combat formations. I then analyzed and thought about these opinions, concentrated them into a new combat plan, and then asked everyone to discuss it. After thorough and repeated research, and after every comrade understood the truth and conducted actual exercises, a new combat formation plan created by the wisdom of the masses was officially applied to combat. Using this formation, my comrades and I achieved one victory after another in crushing the enemy's touted tactics such as "fish bait" and "pincer."

On the morning of × month 15, 1953, I led the air force southward to meet the incoming enemy planes. During the flight, reports from the leading planes of each echelon kept coming from the radio: "× F-86s found in the front left." "× F-86s found in the front right." Based on my own experience, I did not change my determination because of the discovery of the enemy situation, and still ordered the troops to "continue to advance!"

From the reports of the ground and air echelons, I judged that the enemy was approaching from the north in a three-sided encirclement formation with three times our force. At this time, I tried my best to calm myself and analyzed the situation of the enemy and ourselves in the air: the enemy had a large number and had an advantage in height; we had a small number and were at a disadvantage in height. However, we possessed an important factor that determined the victory of the battle—a brave and vigorous fighting spirit. And the enemy had a fatal weakness in this regard. If we only attack one route of the enemy, and the other two routes of the enemy cannot respond, this will give us an advantage in the relative situation, so that the enemy's strengths cannot be brought into play, and the weaknesses are completely exposed, and we will definitely win. So I immediately commanded the air force to rush head-on toward the middle route of the enemy. The enemy was frightened by this brave and sudden movement and hurriedly dodged to both sides. The enemy's formation began to be a little chaotic. At this moment, the radio transmitted the order from the ground commander: "Seize the enemy's weakness and hit them hard!" So I commanded the entire team of planes to suddenly turn back and attack the right wing of the enemy formation. At first, the enemy tried to get rid of the passivity and counterattack us, but I remembered that the leader often taught us that initiative is an important condition for victory, and we must never let the enemy regain the initiative. We immediately launched a continuous and fierce attack on the chaotic enemy planes. We finally victoriously crushed the enemy's conspiracy of encirclement and annihilated, and shot down three enemy planes.

Since then, we have won many battles in a row. In just ten months, our troops shot down and damaged 47 enemy planes; outstanding pilots Li Lanmao, Jiang Longting, Gao Yijing, Tang Yanfeng, etc., each shot down more than four enemy planes and were awarded first-class merit. I myself also shot down two F-86 enemy planes. In the battle, I learned how to use the collective wisdom and strength to command the combat art of the modernized air force. The volunteer air force leading organs praised the achievements of our troops in the air battle, awarded us the collective second-class merit, and awarded me the honorary title of "Second-Class Combat Hero" and "First-Class People's Meritorious Person".

After I left the volunteer army and returned to China from Korea, I returned to the People's Liberation Army. At the conference of representatives of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, I was elected by 133 representatives from the various units of the People's Liberation Army Air Force as a representative of the People's Liberation Army Air Force to attend the first session of the First National People's Congress, and I felt infinitely honored. I know that these honors were obtained under the education of the Party and the supervision of the people. In the future, I must work harder and contribute all my strength to defending the motherland and liberating Taiwan.

    党把我培养成一个空军指挥员了
    全国人民代表大会代表
    人民解放军空军某部指挥员  郑长华
    五年前，新中国成立了。就在这个全国人民为自己伟大祖国的新生而欢腾的时候，我也开始走上新的生活历程——响应党的号召，从人民解放军陆军部队走进了航空学校的大门。当时我心里有无限感触，首先想起了解放战争中围歼山东沂蒙山区孟良崮蒋匪的战斗。当时我们的军队沿着山沟向孟良崮合围，可是敌机却日夜向我们骚扰和轰炸，我们就不得不进行伪装和隐蔽，敌机虽然不能挽救孟良崮匪军覆灭的命运，但确实给我们的战斗增加了困难。记得有的战士轻蔑地骂着：“别作怪，再过几年，看你还这样猖狂不！”当时我心里也想：将来我们一定会建立空军的，说不定我也会当上飞行员，那时候，我一定要把敌机揍下几架来，不允许敌人再这样猖狂。
    现在，这一愿望真的就要实现。我是航空学校的一个学员了。
    进了航空学校以后，复杂的科学技术对于我这文化和科学知识都很不足的人，就像一座崎岖巍峨的大山一样横在面前。每当我在疑难的问题上苦苦思索的时候，或在困难前面有些信心不足的时候，我就想起了敬爱的领袖毛主席的教导：“我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。这就是困难。……我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。……钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”同时，我又记起当我离开部队的时候，首长对我说的话：“掌握航空技术是一项很不简单的事情，在学习中必须发扬过去在战斗中那样的勇敢精神。……”我从这些话里，不断得到鼓舞的力量，克服着重重困难。我学习的信心越来越坚定了。我常常复习功课到深夜，有时还牺牲其他休息时间；有不懂的问题我就首先自己思考，思考还不能解决的就向教师和同学请教。记得为了熟悉飞机座舱里各种设备的位置，我常常和几个同学轮流着蒙住眼睛，坐在舱里，按照大家的发问，一个一个地把各种仪器的位置答出来，以便能够把它们记熟。在那些日子里，我的心完全被飞机吸引住了。经过了很短的时间，我因为学习的成绩较好，获得了甲种学习奖状，并提前一个月在航空学校毕业了。
    走出了航空学校我真有说不出的高兴。我想，我没有辜负党和人民的期望，我终究学会了党和人民需要的一种技术。在这样短的时间里，我自己身上就添了两个翅膀，我应该好好使用这两个翅膀，来保卫祖国的建设事业和人民的和平生活。
    没有多久，当美国侵略者从朝鲜南部进犯到鸭绿江边，全国展开热烈的抗美援朝运动的时候，我立刻报名参加了志愿军空军。很快我就被委任为空军某支队的空中指挥员，领着机群在朝鲜天空和敌人作战了。
    在空中作战，我还是一个新兵，而空中指挥更是我感到生疏的。有一次，在党委会上研究战斗情况的时候，政治委员对我说：“作为一个空中指挥员，要善于总结大家的战斗经验，把大家的智慧集中起来，再用它指导大家的行动。必须记住，飞行员的勇敢和智慧，是要依靠你的正确指挥在战斗中体现和发挥的。”政治委员的话给了我很大的启示。
    在那些紧张战斗的日子里，我一边带领部队作战，一边利用每一个空隙，积极研究战术。飞行员们根据战斗任务结合敌人的活动规律、特点和个人的体会，提出了许多关于改进战斗队形的意见，我再根据这些意见加以分析和思考，集中成一个新的战斗方案后，又请大家来讨论。经过周密的反复的研究，在每个同志都弄通道理并进行了实地演习后，一个用群众智慧创造出来的新的战斗队形的方案，就被正式运用到战斗中去了。运用这个队形，我和我的战友们，在粉碎敌人吹嘘的“鱼饵”“钳形”等战术上，取得了一次又一次的胜利。
    一九五三年×月十五日上午，我率领着机群向南迎击来袭的敌机。飞行途中，从无线电里不断传来各梯队长机的报告：“左前方发现×架F—八六。”“右前方发现×架F—八六。”根据自己的经验，我没有因为这敌情的发现而改变决心，依然命令部队“继续前进！”
    从地面和空中各梯队的报告中，我判断出敌人是以三倍于我们的兵力采取三面包围的队形，向北扑来。我这时候极力使自己镇静，分析着空中的敌我情况：敌人数量多，在高度上占有优势；我们数量少，并在高度上处于劣势。然而，我们却具备着决定战斗胜利的一个重要因素——勇敢旺盛的战斗士气。而敌人在这方面却有着致命的弱点。如果我们只打击敌人的一路，其他两路敌人接应不上，这就会使我们的兵力在相对的情况下占了优势，使敌人的长处无从发挥，而弱点完全暴露，一定可以取胜。于是我立刻指挥机群迎头向中路敌人冲去，敌人被这种勇猛而又突然的动作吓住了，慌忙向两旁躲闪，敌人的队形开始有些混乱了，就在这一瞬间，无线电传来了地面指挥员的命令：“抓住敌人弱点，狠狠地打！”于是我指挥着全队飞机猛地拉转回来，向敌人编队的右翼攻过去了。起初，敌人还企图摆脱被动向我们进行反扑，但是，我想起首长常常教导我们，主动是胜利的重要条件，绝不能让敌人恢复主动。我们马上向混乱的敌机进行了连续而猛烈的攻击，我们终于胜利地粉碎了敌人合击的阴谋，击落了三架敌机。
    此后，我们一连打了好多次胜仗。仅只十个月的时间，我们部队就击落击伤敌机四十七架；出色的飞行员李兰茂、姜龙亭、高义敬、唐彦峰等，都各打掉敌机四架以上，立了一等功。我自己也击落F—八六敌机两架。我在战斗中，学习了如何运用集体的智慧和力量，指挥现代化空军的作战艺术了。志愿军空军领导机关表扬了我们部队在空战中的功绩，给我们立了集体二等功，并授给我“二级战斗英雄”和“一等人民功臣”的荣誉称号。
    我离开了志愿军部队从朝鲜归国以后，又重新回到解放军部队里。在解放军空军军人代表大会会议上，被来自解放军空军各部队的一百三十三名代表，选为解放军空军出席第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的代表，我感到无限的光荣。我知道这些光荣都是在党的教养和人民的督促下得到的。今后我一定要更加努力工作，为保卫祖国，解放台湾贡献出我的一切力量。
