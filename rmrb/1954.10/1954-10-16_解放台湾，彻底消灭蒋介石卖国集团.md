Liberate Taiwan and Thoroughly Eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek Traitorous Clique
Peng Zemin

As we celebrate the birth of our country's first constitution, as we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, everyone's heart is filled with boundless joy, and everyone feels happy for the ever-improving lives of the people and the country's gradual progress towards a socialist society, and everyone feels honored for the ever-growing strength of our motherland. While we are rejoicing and encouraged, we have not forgotten that our territory, Taiwan, has not yet been liberated, and the eight million compatriots living in Taiwan are still under the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, living a life of misery and suffering. Moreover, we are even more aware that liberating Taiwan is our current urgent task, it is an inseparable part of our great revolutionary cause, and we must liberate Taiwan.

Taiwan has been an inseparable part of our sacred territory since ancient times. Although Japanese imperialism once occupied Taiwan for fifty years, it was never able to subdue the Taiwanese compatriots' will to resist aggression. Taiwanese compatriots have been persistently resisting the Japanese aggressors since 1895 without interruption. In 1945, after the Chinese people and the great Soviet Union defeated Japanese imperialism, the whole world unanimously recognized that Taiwan must be returned to China, which was clearly recorded in the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation." At that time, the United States government had to admit this fact as well. As late as February 9, 1950, the United States State Department issued a statement saying that if the United States were to "establish a non-Chinese administrative authority in Taiwan, this would almost universally be interpreted in mainland China and widely interpreted in Asia as a violation of its assurances by this government and a betrayal of our long-standing policy of respecting China's territorial integrity, and an attempt to detach Taiwan from China." However, before the ink of this statement was dry, the United States aggressive clique tore it up, and in June 1950, it blatantly sent its Seventh Fleet to invade Taiwan, obstructing our country's liberation of Taiwan. This is a serious act of betrayal and breach of faith by the United States aggressive clique.

In fact, the United States had already signed the so-called "Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as early as November 1946, before the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fled to Taiwan, using this to massively invade Taiwan. Later, it successively obtained various privileges from the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to further control and plunder Taiwan. Now, the United States military advisory group has controlled the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's military and political affairs, the United States monopoly capital has controlled the economic lifeline of Taiwan, occupied Taiwan's ports, and built dozens of airports in various parts of Taiwan, turning Taiwan into its colony and military base. U.S. warmongers like MacArthur openly said that Taiwan is an unsinkable aircraft carrier for the United States in the Pacific, and that Taiwan is not only a springboard for the United States to attack the Chinese mainland, but also an important stronghold connecting Japan in the north and the Nanyang Islands in the south. These words are precisely the confessions of the United States aggressive clique before the people of the world. This confession shows that the aggressive ambitions of the United States aggressive clique are not only to occupy Taiwan, but also to attack our mainland and invade the entire Asia.

Under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the lives of the Taiwanese compatriots have become increasingly difficult. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has sold all of Taiwan's industries, mineral resources, and various wealth to the U.S. monopoly capital group. The U.S. Reynolds Company has controlled Taiwan's aluminum industry and taken over the Kaohsiung Aluminum Mine, one of the largest aluminum mines in Asia. The U.S. Gulf Oil Corporation has completely controlled Taiwan's oil industry, and Taiwan's thirty-four power plants have fallen into the hands of the U.S. electric power trust, "Westinghouse Electric Corporation." U.S. General Electric has controlled Taiwan's cement industry. Taiwan's chemical fertilizer industry has been controlled by the U.S. National Fertilizer Company. U.S. monopoly capital also controls the Kaohsiung Ammonium Sulfate Plant, exploits Taiwan's gold and copper mines, and controls the sugar, camphor, paper, salt, and other industries, as well as shipyards, docks, and transportation industries. Taiwan was originally a place rich in sugarcane, but since Chiang Kai-shek occupied it, Taiwan's sugar industry has plummeted. More than 60 percent of the remaining sugar industry has fallen into the hands of U.S. capitalists, and most of the privately-owned enterprises engaged in the sugar industry have gone bankrupt. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's traitorous acts of selling Taiwan's wealth are still increasing. According to the so-called "Three-Year Industrial Plan" proposed by the U.S. White Engineering Company, all of Taiwan's industries, even household handicrafts, will be gradually controlled and swallowed up by U.S. monopoly capital. As for Taiwan's foreign trade, it goes without saying. From 1950 to June 1954, the commodities dumped in Taiwan by the United States in the form of "material assistance" amounted to more than 290 million U.S. dollars, equivalent to more than 65 percent of Taiwan's total import settlement during this period. In addition, Japanese goods controlled by U.S. capital are also pouring into Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique also organized the so-called "Sino-U.S. Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee" with the United States, forcing farmers to grow raw materials needed by U.S. monopoly capital, and forcing fishermen to supply a large amount of seafood to the fishing companies exclusively owned by U.S. capital. U.S. monopoly capital has universally invaded the countryside, savagely exploiting farmers and fishermen.

Recently, in order to satisfy the greed of U.S. monopoly capital, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has further sold out the rights and interests of the motherland and the blood and sweat of the Taiwanese compatriots. After signing the so-called "U.S. Private Investment Guarantee Agreement" with the U.S. government, it then announced the so-called "Foreign Investment Regulations." According to this regulation, not only were the places in its pseudo-company law, mining law, land law, maritime law, and civil aviation law that were "not convenient enough" for foreign investment deleted, but also various special preferential treatments were given to its U.S. masters to plunder Taiwanese compatriots and annex Taiwanese private enterprises. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's crime of stealing and selling Taiwan has really reached the point of madness.

As for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's direct exploitation of Taiwanese compatriots, it is even more brutal. After Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan under the protection of the United States, he used his old method of issuing "gold yuan coupons" to plunder the people's wealth to rob the Taiwanese compatriots. It issued pseudo-new Taiwan dollars at a rate of one pseudo-new Taiwan dollar to 40,000 pseudo-Taiwan dollars; the amount of pseudo-new Taiwan dollars issued by March of this year has increased by more than 15 times compared with June 1949, which means that after Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan, its inflation has reached more than 600,000 times. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's budget deficit for the 1954-55 fiscal year reached as high as 800 million pseudo-new Taiwan dollars. Judging from this point alone, this inflation is still increasing. Under such malignant inflation, prices will naturally soar. For example, the price of salt in July 1953 was 100 times higher than in June 1949. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not satisfied with only slaughtering Taiwanese compatriots in this way. It is also extorting rice from Taiwan in exchange for "U.S. aid," and even launched a so-called "No Rice Day" movement.

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has consistently engaged in deceiving, extorting, and stealing remittances from overseas Chinese. With the support of the U.S. aggressive clique, it endlessly persecutes overseas Chinese, coercing and inducing overseas Chinese youth to go to Taiwan to serve as cannon fodder for it.

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not only a thief who sells out Taiwan, oppresses Taiwanese compatriots, and persecutes overseas Chinese, but also a pirate in the Pacific. At the instigation of the U.S. aggressive clique, it constantly robs our coastal fishermen, uses U.S. planes to bomb our coastal cities and villages, and frequently attacks and robs merchant ships from various countries coming to our country for trade. It also constantly clamors for "counter-attacking" our mainland, deliberately provoking a new world war, and vainly attempting to find its own way out of a world war. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not only the public enemy of the Chinese people, but also the public enemy of the people of Asia and the world.

The Chinese people absolutely cannot sit idly by and watch the eight million Taiwanese compatriots groan under the trampling of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and absolutely cannot tolerate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique occupying Taiwan, threatening our country's security and Asian peace. We must thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, liberate Taiwan, and we must complete the great liberation cause of the Chinese people.

Liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed. As mentioned above, the U.S. aggressive clique not only invades Taiwan, but also attempts to use Taiwan as a military base to invade the entire Asia. Therefore, our elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberation of Taiwan is precisely to defend Asian peace and world peace. Our just struggle to liberate Taiwan has been supported by all peace-loving countries and peace-loving people all over the world.

Recently, some people in Britain and other Western countries have put forward an absurd argument, saying that Taiwan should be "neutralized" or placed under "United Nations trusteeship." Their proposal is actually equivalent to placing Taiwan under long-term occupation by the United States. If someone advocated "neutralizing" or placing under "United Nations trusteeship" a part of British or U.S. territory, would the people who clamor for this fallacy think it reasonable? Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the U.S. armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan. There is no question of "neutralizing" Taiwan or placing it under "United Nations trusteeship." Therefore, these absurd arguments are firmly opposed by the Chinese people.

Taiwanese compatriots have a revolutionary tradition of resisting foreign aggression and reactionary rule. Today, Taiwanese compatriots have a strong motherland, and the compatriots of the motherland must liberate them and enable them to return to the embrace of the motherland and live a peaceful and happy life. Historical experience tells us that as long as our people unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, our just struggle will surely be victorious.

The struggle to liberate Taiwan is not a simple military struggle, and we also need to strengthen our work in all aspects to achieve victory. Everyone must promote a high degree of patriotism, give full play to their initiative and creativity, and do a good job in their respective posts to support the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团
    彭泽民
    当我们庆祝我国第一个宪法诞生的时候，当我们庆祝中华人民共和国建国五周年的时候，每个人都从心里涌起了无限的欢欣，都为着全国人民生活日益提高和国家日益走向社会主义社会而感到幸福，都为着我们祖国日益强大而感到光荣。当我们在欢欣鼓舞的时候，我们并没有忘记：我国领土台湾还没有获得解放，住在台湾的八百万同胞还处在蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治下，过着水深火热的苦难生活。而且我们更加认识到解放台湾是我们当前的迫切任务，它是我们伟大的革命事业不可分的一部分，我们一定要解放台湾。
    台湾自古就是我国神圣领土的一部分。日本帝国主义虽曾侵占台湾五十年，但始终不能压服台湾同胞反抗侵略的意志，台湾同胞从一八九五年起，一直没有间断地坚持着反对日本侵略者的斗争。一九四五年，中国人民和伟大苏联击败日本帝国主义后，全世界一致公认台湾必须归还中国，“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”中也记载得明明白白。当时美国政府也不得不承认这一事实。就在一九五○年二月九日，美国国务院还发表一个声明说，如果美国要“在台湾建立一个非中国的行政当局，这就会在中国大陆上几乎普遍地解释为和在亚洲广泛地解释为本政府违背了它的保证，并背弃我们一向尊重中国领土完整的长期政策，而企图使台湾脱离中国。”可是这个声明的墨迹未干，美国侵略集团就把它撕毁掉了，竟于一九五○年六月公然派遣它的第七舰队侵占台湾，阻挠我国解放台湾。这是美国侵略集团的严重的背信弃义行为。
    事实上，美国早在蒋介石卖国集团逃到台湾之前——一九四六年十一月，就和蒋介石卖国集团签定了所谓“中美商约”，借此大肆侵入台湾。以后又陆续从蒋介石卖国集团手里取得了进一步控制和掠夺台湾的各种特权。现在，美国的军事顾问团已控制了蒋介石卖国集团的军事和政治，美国的垄断资本已控制了台湾的经济命脉，占据了台湾的港口，并在台湾各地建筑了几十处飞机场，把台湾变成了它的殖民地和军事基地。美国好战分子麦克阿瑟之流，公然说什么台湾是美国在太平洋上不沉的航空母舰，又说什么台湾不仅是美国进攻中国大陆的跳板，而且是北接日本南连南洋群岛的重要据点。这些话正是美国侵略集团在世界人民面前的供状。这个供状表明了美国侵略集团的侵略野心不仅是侵占台湾，而且要进攻我国大陆和侵略整个亚洲。
    在蒋介石卖国集团统治下，台湾同胞的生活已经如水益深，如火益热了。蒋介石卖国集团已将台湾工业、矿藏资源以及各种财富一齐出卖给美国垄断资本集团。美国雷诺公司已控制了台湾的制铝工业，并接管了亚洲规模最大的铝矿之一的高雄铝矿。美国的海湾石油公司已全部掌握了台湾的石油工业，台湾的三十四个电力厂已落到美国电业托拉斯的“威斯汀豪斯电气公司”的手里。美国通用公司已经控制了台湾的水泥工业。台湾的化学肥料工业已被美国国家肥料公司所控制。美国垄断资本还控制了高雄硫酸錏厂，开采台湾的金矿、铜矿，控制了糖业、樟脑、造纸、食盐等工业，控制了船坞、码头和运输业。台湾本是盛产甘蔗的地方，但自蒋介石盘据后，台湾的制糖工业便一落千丈，剩下的制糖工业已有百分之六十以上落入美国资本家手里，绝大部分经营糖业的民营企业都纷纷破产了。蒋介石卖国集团出卖台湾财富的卖国行为，还在有加无已。依照美国怀特工程公司提出的所谓“三年工业计划”，台湾的一切工业甚至家庭手工业，都将逐步为美国垄断资本所控制和鲸吞。至于台湾的对外贸易更不用说了，从一九五○年到一九五四年六月这段期间，美国以“物资援助”方式在台湾倾销的商品即达两亿九千余万美元，相当于台湾这个时期进口结汇总额的百分之六十五以上。此外，还有美国资本所控制的日本商品，也源源向台湾倾销。蒋介石卖国集团又与美国组织所谓“中美农村复兴联合委员会”，强迫农民种植美国垄断资本所需要的原料，强迫渔民以大量海产供给美国资本所独占的渔业公司，美国垄断资本普遍侵入农村，野蛮地榨取农民和渔民。
    最近，蒋介石卖国集团为了满足美国垄断资本的贪欲，又进一步出卖祖国的权益和台湾同胞的血汗。它在和美国政府签定所谓“美国私人投资保证协定”后，接着就公布了所谓“外国人投资条例”，根据这个条例，不但把它的伪公司法、矿业法、土地法、海商法以及民用航空法中对外国人投资“不够方便”的地方都一齐删去，而且特别对其美国主子掠夺台湾同胞，并吞台湾民营企业，给予种种特殊优待。蒋介石卖国集团这种盗卖台湾的罪行实在已经到了丧心病狂的程度了。
    至于蒋介石卖国集团对台湾同胞的直接剥削，更是残暴绝伦。蒋介石在美国庇护下逃到台湾后，又用他过去发行“金元券”抢劫人民财富的老办法，来抢劫台湾同胞。它以一元伪新台币兑换四万元伪台币，发行了伪新台币；伪新台币的发行额到今年三月止，已比一九四九年六月增加了十五倍以上，这就是说蒋贼逃到台湾后，其通货膨胀已到了六十万倍以上。蒋介石卖国集团的一九五四—五五财政年度预算赤字竟达八亿元伪新台币，仅由这点看来，这种通货膨胀还在有增无已。在这样恶性通货膨胀下，物价自然要扶摇直上，例如食盐一项，一九五三年七月就比一九四九年六月上涨了一百倍。蒋介石卖国集团还不以这样宰割台湾同胞为满足，它又在勒索台湾的大米，以换取“美援”，竟发起所谓“不吃米日”运动。
    蒋介石卖国集团一贯地对海外华侨实行欺骗、敲诈和盗窃侨汇的勾当。它并在美国侵略集团的支持下，无休止地迫害华侨，胁迫和诱骗华侨青年子弟去台湾给它充当炮灰。
    蒋介石卖国集团不仅是出卖台湾，压榨台湾同胞和迫害华侨的蟊贼，它还是太平洋上的海盗。它在美国侵略集团的唆使下，不断地抢劫我国沿海渔民，用美国飞机轰炸我沿海城市和乡村，经常袭击和抢劫前来我国进行贸易的各国商船。它还不住地叫嚣着“反攻”我国大陆，蓄意挑起新的世界战争，妄图从世界战争中寻找自己的出路。蒋介石卖国集团不仅是中国人民的公敌，而且是亚洲和世界各国人民的公敌。
    中国人民绝对不能坐视八百万台湾同胞呻吟于蒋介石卖国集团的蹂躏下，绝对不能容忍蒋介石卖国集团盘据台湾，威胁我国的安全和亚洲和平。我们一定要彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾，我们一定要完成中国人民的伟大的解放事业。
    解放台湾是中国的内政，绝不容许任何外国干涉。如上所述，美国侵略集团不仅侵占台湾，而且企图以台湾为军事基地，侵略整个亚洲。因此，我们消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾，正是为了保卫亚洲和平和世界和平。我们解放台湾的正义斗争，已经得到了一切爱好和平的国家和全世界爱好和平人民的支持。
    近来，英国及其他西方国家有一些人放出一种荒谬的论调，说什么要把台湾“中立化”或交“联合国托管”。他们的这种主张实际上等于要把台湾放在美国的长期侵占之下。假设有人主张把英国或美国领土的一部分“中立化”或交“联合国托管”，叫嚷这种谬论的人也以为是合理的吗？台湾是中国的领土，美国武装力量必须撤出台湾，这里根本谈不到什么使台湾“中立化”和交“联合国托管”的问题。因此这些荒谬的论调是中国人民所坚决反对的。
    台湾同胞具有反抗外国侵略和反动统治的革命传统。今天台湾同胞已经有了强大的祖国，祖国同胞一定要解放他们，使他们回到祖国的怀抱过和平幸福的生活。历史的经验告诉我们，只要我们全国人民紧密地团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，我们的正义斗争就一定胜利。
    解放台湾的斗争不是单纯的军事上的斗争，还需要我们从各方面加强工作来取得胜利。每个人都要发扬高度的爱国主义精神，发挥积极性和创造性，做好各个岗位上的工作。来支援解放台湾的神圣斗争。
