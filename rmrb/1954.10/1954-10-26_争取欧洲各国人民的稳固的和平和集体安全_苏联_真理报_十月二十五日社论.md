    Striving for a Stable Peace and Collective Security for the People of Europe
    ——Editorial from the Soviet "Pravda" October 25th

    On October 23rd, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States. In the current international situation, this note and the suggestions put forward in it are of extraordinarily great significance.

    The entire Soviet note is permeated with the Soviet Union's deep desire to spare no effort in promoting the consolidation of peace and security in Europe. This task can only be resolved through the joint efforts of all European countries. Proceeding from this only correct premise, and in order to facilitate the resolution of the European security issue, the Soviet government has proposed a draft of the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe," and at the same time expressed its willingness to study other suggestions related to this issue.

    The draft proposed by the Soviet Union suggests establishing a collective security system in Europe that can ensure the maintenance of peace through the collective efforts of all relevant European countries, regardless of their social and political systems. The foundation of the All-European Treaty draft proposed by the Soviet Union is the principle of its member states taking collective action against threats and armed attacks on any signatory country to the treaty, as well as the principle of economic cooperation. This means that any attempt at aggression by any country will immediately require collective sanctions against the aggressor.

    Therefore, the All-European Treaty draft proposed by the Soviet Union contains genuine guarantees for the security of France and Poland, Britain and the Soviet Union, and all European countries, large and small. At the same time, it creates the most favorable conditions for re-establishing Germany's national unity and for Germany's free and peaceful development.

    As everyone knows, Western countries have raised objections to the Soviet draft, but they have so far not put forward any suggestions for guaranteeing collective security in Europe. At the same time, they are continuing to piece together exclusive military blocs, drawing West Germany into such blocs.

    The agreements signed by Western countries at the separate Paris conference to achieve this goal will not only fail to promote the easing of international tensions, but will instead worsen the international situation.

    The situation now is this:

    Either the four countries bearing special responsibility for resolving the German question will make every effort to begin examining and resolving the most pressing issue – the restoration of German unity, an issue that concerns not only the German people but also all peace-loving people in Europe.

    Or things will develop to the point where German militarism is revived and West Germany joins an aggressive military bloc, in which case Germany will remain divided for a long time, and a remilitarized West Germany will become a direct threat to peace in Europe.

    Facts show that the US ruling clique, bent on playing its final cards, is doing everything possible to deepen and strengthen the dangerous division of Germany. The unilateral London talks and the just-concluded unilateral Paris talks have adopted agreements that are fundamentally contrary to the interests of maintaining peace and are deepening the threat of a new war in Europe. Once these agreements are implemented, an armed West Germany participating in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc can no longer be considered a peace-loving country, which will make the restoration of German unity impossible for a long time.

    In this situation, the solution to the problem of a unified Germany cannot be shelved. Whether considering the interests of the national security of European countries or the interests of the German people themselves, it is necessary to immediately resolve such a major issue so that the people of Europe can believe that a unified Germany will not fall into the hands of the sworn enemies of peace – German militarists and revanchists.

    As before, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to hold free all-German elections in order to restore German unity. In conducting such elections, the German people must have the opportunity to express their free will so that German unification can be achieved as a peaceful and democratic country.

    In the note, the Soviet government expressed its willingness to once again study the suggestions on holding all-German elections put forward by Britain at the Berlin Four-Power Conference and supported by France and the United States. The Soviet government did so based on the premise that the corresponding suggestions put forward by the Soviet Union would be studied simultaneously.

    Is it possible for the positions of the governments to converge, and is it possible for them to reach an agreement on this issue? Yes, it is possible, as long as everyone recognizes the undeniable principle that unifying Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis is the primary task. At the Berlin Conference, this was mainly hindered by the plan to establish the "European Defense Community." Now, the European military plan has gone bankrupt. Can we allow reactionary forces to obstruct people from taking advantage of the good opportunity to restore German unity that has arisen as a result, and once again erect obstacles that have long been eliminated in the form of a "Western European Union" plan? Peace-loving people of all countries cannot tolerate such a prospect.

    The drafters of the "Western European Union" plan have not been able to conceal from public opinion the obvious fact that this plan is incompatible with the restoration of the sovereignty of the German people. In fact, the agreements signed at the Paris Conference under this plan will allow the occupying forces to remain stationed in West Germany until 1998, that is, until the end of this century. According to the terms of this agreement, West Germany will still be bound by the enslaving terms of the "Bonn Treaty."

    The Soviet proposal opens up another prospect. In order to provide favorable conditions for the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany and to promote the solution of the task of German national unification, the Soviet government suggested in the note that it discuss with the governments of Britain, France, and the United States the issue of withdrawing the occupying forces from the eastern and western parts of Germany, and suggested that the occupying forces be withdrawn now without delay.

    Simultaneously with the resolution of this issue, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States must also reach an agreement with the participation of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on the size, deployment, and equipment of various German police forces in the eastern and western parts of Germany. This would eliminate all concerns about the rearmament of eastern and western Germany. The Western countries are pursuing a policy of reviving German militarism and establishing a military bloc aimed primarily against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, which is a violation of the obligations jointly undertaken by France, Britain, and the United States with the Soviet Union.

    It cannot be ignored that the French government's agreement to accept and implement the London Agreement is a clear violation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in 1944.

    The measures against West Germany drawn up in London and Paris also directly violate the proposals on universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons put forward by the French and British governments in June of this year and supported by the US government. As everyone knows, the Soviet government has suggested using the aforementioned proposals of France and Britain as a basis, and therefore, the views of both sides on this important issue have obviously become closer. But everyone should be clear that it is impossible to propose universal disarmament on the one hand and implement the remilitarization of West Germany on the other.

    As for the Austrian issue, it has not been resolved for many years due to the obstruction of Western countries, which regard Austria as one of the objects of their military plans. Now the

    争取欧洲各国人民的稳固的和平和集体安全
    ——苏联“真理报”十月二十五日社论
    十月二十三日，苏联政府照会法、英、美三国政府。在当前国际形势中，这一照会和照会中提出的建议具有异常巨大的意义。
    整个苏联照会中贯穿着苏联深切地愿意竭尽全力促进欧洲和平与安全的巩固的精神。这一任务只有经过欧洲各国的共同努力才能解决。从这个唯一正确的前提出发，为了便利解决欧洲安全问题起见，苏联政府曾提出“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案，同时表示愿意研究有关这个问题的其他建议。
    苏联提出的草案建议在欧洲建立一个能够通过各有关欧洲国家——不问其社会和政治制度如何——的集体努力使和平的维护得到保障的集体安全体系。苏联提出的全欧条约草案的基础，是它的成员国采取集体行动反对对这个条约的任何签字国的威胁和武装攻击的原则以及在经济方面合作的原则。这意味着任何国家进行侵略的尝试将立即要求对侵略者实行集体制裁。
    因此苏联提出的全欧条约草案，包含着对法国和波兰，对英国和苏联以及对一切欧洲大小国家的安全的真正保障。同时它为重新建立德国的国家统一、为德国的自由和平发展创造了最有利的条件。
    大家知道，西方国家对苏联的草案提出了反对意见，但它们至今没有提出任何保障欧洲集体安全的建议。同时它们还在继续拼凑排他性的军事集团，把西德拉入这种集团。
    西方国家在巴黎单独会议上为了达到这个目的而签订的协定不仅不能促进国际紧张局势的缓和，反而会使国际局势恶化。
    目前形成了这种情况：
    要末就是对解决德国问题负有特别责任的四个国家竭尽一切努力，以着手审查和解决最迫切的问题——恢复德国统一的问题，这个问题不仅是德国人民关心的，同时也是欧洲各国一切爱好和平的人民关心的。
    要末就是事情发展到德国军国主义复活和西德加入侵略性的军事集团，那样德国就会长久分裂下去，而重新军国主义化的西德就会成为对欧洲和平的直接威胁。
    事实说明，要出了最后的花样的美国统治集团竭尽努力，要加深和加强危险的德国分裂局面。片面性的伦敦会谈以及刚刚结束的片面性的巴黎会谈通过了协议，这些协议是和维持和平的利益根本矛盾的，并且是加深了欧洲新战争的威胁的。这些协议一旦实现，武装起来的并参加了侵略性北大西洋集团的西德就不能再被认为是一个爱好和平的国家了，这也就使得恢复德国的统一在长时期内成为不可能。
    在这种情况下，不能把解决统一德国的问题搁置起来。无论从欧洲各国的国家安全的利益考虑，还是从德国人民本身的利益考虑，都要求立刻解决这样一个重大的问题，以便欧洲各国人民可以相信，统一的德国不会落在和平的死敌——德国军国主义者和复仇主义者的手中。
    像以前一样，苏联政府认为，为了恢复德国的统一有必要举行全德自由选举。在进行这种选举时，德国人民必须有机会表达自己的自由的意志，以便使德国统一成为一个和平和民主的国家。
    苏联政府在照会中表示愿意再度研究在柏林四国会议上经英国提出并经法国和美国支持的关于举行全德选举的建议，苏联政府这样做是从下列前提出发的：苏联提出的相应的建议将同时予以研究。
    各国政府的立场是不是可能接近，它们是不是可能就这个问题达成协议呢？是的，这是可能的，只要大家承认在和平民主的基础上统一德国是主要任务这一无可争辩的原则。在柏林会议上这一点主要是受到了建立“欧洲防务集团”计划的阻挠。现在，欧洲军计划已经破产了。是不是可以容许反动势力阻挠人们利用由此而产生的恢复德国统一的良好机会，并以“西欧联盟”计划的方式，再次树立早已经消除掉的障碍呢？爱好和平的各国人民是不能容忍这种前景的。
    “西欧联盟”计划的拟订者没有能够在舆论面前掩饰这一显见的事实：这个计划是和恢复德国人民的主权不相容的。事实上，巴黎会议上根据这个计划所签订的协定将使占领军在西德一直驻扎到一九九八年，那就是到本世纪末。根据这个协定的条款，西德仍然要受奴役性的“波恩条约”条款的束缚。
    苏联的建议打开了另一种前景。为了替德国两个部分的接近提供有利条件和促进德意志民族统一任务的解决，苏联政府在照会中建议和英国、法国及美国三国政府讨论从德国东西两部撤出占领军的问题，并建议现在就毫不拖延地撤退占领军。
    和解决这个问题同时，苏联、法国、英国和美国还必须在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的参加下，就德国东西两部各种德国警察的员额、配置和装备达成协议。这就可以消除对德国东部和西部的重新武装的各种挂虑。西方国家在执行着复活德国军国主义和建立首先是反对苏联和人民民主国家的军事集团的政策，这是违反法、英、美三国同苏联共同承担的义务的。
    不能不看到，法国政府同意接受和实现伦敦协定，是明显地违反一九四四年签订的法苏同盟互助条约的。
    在伦敦和巴黎拟定的对西德的措施，也直接违反法国和英国政府在今年六月提出并且受到美国政府支持的、关于普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的建议。大家知道，苏联政府曾建议以法国和英国上述建议为基础，因此，双方对这个重要问题的看法显然已经有所接近。但是大家都应当很清楚：不可能一面建议普遍裁减军备，一面实行西德重新军国主义化。
    至于奥地利问题，由于西方国家的作梗，许多年来一直没有解决，它们把奥地利看成是它们军事计划的对象之一。现在苏联政府想要知道美、英、法三国政府是否同意它们的大使参加苏联政府所建议的维也纳会议，以讨论有关对奥和约草案的问题以及和缔结对奥和约有关的其他问题。苏联政府本着加强和平和安全的不变的愿望在它的十月二十三日的照会中建议在十一月间召开四国外交部长的会议，来讨论以下问题：
    （一）在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，举行全德自由选举；
      （二）四国占领军撤出东西德的领土；
    （三）召开全欧会议，以讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。
    由此看来，苏联政府十月二十三日的照会指出了进一步缓和国际紧张局势的道路，这就是全体爱好和平的人民所关心的。
    苏联的公众和欧洲各国爱好和平的人民一道欢迎苏联政府提出的以加强和平和国际安全为目的的新建议。全体苏联人民都热烈地拥护苏共中央发布的庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年的口号：
    “祝各国人民在反对复活德国军国主义，反对建立侵略性的军事集团的斗争中的团结日益巩固！争取持久和平和欧洲各国人民的集体安全！”
