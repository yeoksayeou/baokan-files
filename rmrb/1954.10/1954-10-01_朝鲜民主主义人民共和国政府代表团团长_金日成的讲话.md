Comrades, esteemed guests:

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the great fraternal People's Republic of China, I extend, on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and all the Korean people, warm congratulations and honor to you, and through you, to all the Chinese people.

Five years ago, the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, after a long revolutionary struggle, eradicated the reactionary rule of foreign imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and established the People's Republic of China.

This great historical event in Asia not only realized the historical aspirations of the Chinese people but also became a great victory for the world democratic camp. It opened a new era for the national liberation struggles of the people in colonial and dependent countries groaning under imperialist oppression.

Welcoming the fifth anniversary of its founding, the People's Republic of China, thanks to the patriotic selflessness and creative labor struggle of the Chinese people, has eradicated the remnants of long-term and vicious feudal imperialist colonial rule, achieved the unification of the national territory and the unity of all nationalities, strengthened the broad people's democratic united front based on the worker-peasant alliance, and achieved great victories in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural construction.

The great Chinese people have made tremendous contributions not only to domestic life but also to the cause of safeguarding world and Far Eastern peace. The People's Republic of China, together with the Soviet Union, played a significant role in the victory of achieving the Korean armistice and restoring peace in Indochina.

Now, regardless of whether the aggressive blocs are willing or not, no one can deny that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no important international issue concerning the consolidation of peace among nations can be resolved.

Today, for the first time in history, the great Chinese people, on the basis of complete equality and freedom, have elected and established local administrative organs and supreme organs of power that truly represent the interests of the people. Especially the constitution passed by this National People's Congress, which in legislative form fixes the achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects of domestic and foreign affairs over the five years since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, consolidates the people's democratic system, and embodies the people's constitution on the road to socialism, is another great victory achieved by the Chinese people.

Our government delegation extends warm congratulations to this newly established National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and to the newly elected government leading personnel headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people.

Dear comrades, esteemed guests!

The prosperity of the great People's Republic of China and the further consolidation of the friendship and solidarity between the peoples of China and Korea are of great significance in the struggle to defend peace in the Far East and the world, especially in the struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of our fatherland.

The friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China have been formed and developed since early times in the struggle against common enemies.

This friendship and solidarity have been further consolidated and developed in the just Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people against the armed aggression of American imperialists and the traitorous Li Chengwan bandit gang, and through the Sino-Korean economic and cultural cooperation agreement in the post-war period.

During the arduous Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people against the armed aggression of American imperialists and the traitorous Li Chengwan rebels, the great Chinese people, holding high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, not only gave the war-torn Korean people active material and spiritual assistance, but also dispatched the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to the Korean battlefield to aid the Korean people with blood.

The brave commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who came to Korea with righteous steps, were warmly supported and cherished by the Korean people. Together with the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, they displayed unparalleled heroism in the fierce battles to eliminate the common enemy, protected the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from enemy invasion, dealt heavy blows to the enemy militarily, politically, and morally, achieved the victory of the armistice, and made great contributions to the great cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

Today, the Korean people express close friendship and deep gratitude to some of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers who have established brilliant merits in the common struggle against American imperialism and returned to their country.

The immortal feats and the model of proletarian internationalism displayed by the heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers will live forever in the hearts of our people along with our country's endless prosperity.

The Chinese people have given us enormous material assistance in order to rapidly restore and construct our national economy, which was severely damaged by the war, and have sent many technicians to help us. This assistance from the Chinese people and the assistance from the people's democratic countries headed by the great Soviet Union have made great contributions to the post-war recovery and construction and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

Encouraged by the noble assistance of the people of various fraternal countries, the Korean people have already achieved considerable success in the past year's struggle to restore and build the people's economy.

Large and small factories, enterprises, schools, hospitals, and other cultural facilities and residences have been established everywhere, and the people's lives have been stabilized and improved. In our country, people building a new life are carrying out creative labor. The Korean people clearly know that all these achievements are inseparable from the great assistance of the Chinese people.

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Korean people express closer friendship to the fraternal Chinese people and extend high respect and gratitude to the Chinese people, the government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people.

Dear friends:

Seeing that the situation in Asia has eased somewhat after the realization of the armistice in Korea and Indochina, and that cooperation among the Asian people has been further strengthened on the basis of peaceful coexistence, the American imperialist aggressors have become alarmed and are trying everything possible to deteriorate the international situation in order to continue to maintain world tension. Therefore, they have instigated the Li Chengwan bandit gang to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in every possible way and to maintain the tension in Korea.

Under such circumstances, we must further consolidate and develop the victories already achieved in the cause of safeguarding peace, expose and smash the adventurous policies of the aggressors, in order to fulfill the peaceful reunification of the fatherland that the Korean people desire day and night.

The more complex the international situation is today, the more we must increase our vigilance against the enemy a hundredfold. We should further consolidate the internationalist friendship and solidarity between the world democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and especially further strengthen the friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China, which are forged in blood. The iron-like unity between the peoples of Korea and China, which no force can destroy, will surely smash any conspiracy of the enemy to undermine our just and great cause, and more victoriously promote the cause of peaceful reunification of our country and of maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia.

Finally, on the glorious festival of the People's China, I represent the Korean people in warmly celebrating the great Chinese people's achievement of more brilliant success in the struggle to strengthen the power of their people's democratic state and to build socialism, and in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and defend peace in Asia and the world.

Long live the fifth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the eternal and indestructible traditional friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China!

Long live the invincible camp of peace headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and the great Chinese people and their leader Comrade Mao Zedong!

    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团团长
    金日成的讲话亲爱的同志们，尊敬的各位：
    值此伟大的兄弟的中华人民共和国建国五周年之际，我以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会以及全朝鲜人民的名义，向你们并通过你们，向全中国人民致以热烈的祝贺与荣誉。
    五年前，伟大的中国人民在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，经过长期的革命斗争，肃清了外来帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的反动统治制度，成立了中华人民共和国。
    亚洲的这一伟大的历史事变，不仅实现了中国人民的历史宿愿，同时成为世界民主阵营的巨大的胜利，它给呻吟在帝国主义压迫下的殖民地附属国人民的民族解放斗争，开辟了新的时代。
    迎接建国五周年的中华人民共和国，由于中国人民的一切爱国的忘我精神和创造性劳动的斗争结果，肃清了长期的凶恶的封建的帝国主义殖民地统治的残余，实现了全国领土的统一和各民族的团结，加强了以工农联盟为基础的广泛的人民民主统一战线，并在社会主义建设中取得了政治、经济、文化等各方面的巨大的胜利。
    伟大的中国人民不仅在国内生活方面，并且在维护世界和远东的和平事业方面也作了巨大的贡献；在争取朝鲜停战的胜利和恢复印度支那和平的事业中，中华人民共和国和苏联一起，所起的作用是巨大的。
    现在不管侵略集团愿意或不愿意，任何人也不能否认，如果没有中华人民共和国参加，就不能解决任何有关巩固各国人民之间的和平的重要国际问题。
    今天，伟大的中国人民在历史上第一次，在完全平等自由的基础上，选举创立了真正代表人民利益的地方行政机关和最高权力机关；尤其是这一次人民代表大会所通过的宪法，是以立法的形式固定了长期的革命斗争和中华人民共和国建立以后五年来中国人民在国内和对外等各方面所取得的成就，巩固人民民主制度、体现走向社会主义的人民的宪法，是中国人民达成的又一个伟大的胜利。
    我们政府代表团谨向这次新创立的中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会，和以中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志为首的新当选的政府领导工作人员们致以热烈的祝贺。亲爱的同志们，尊敬的各位！
    伟大的中华人民共和国的繁荣和朝中两国人民的友谊团结的更加巩固，在保卫远东和世界和平的斗争中，特别是争取我们祖国和平统一的斗争中，具有巨大的意义。
    朝中两国人民的友谊团结是很早以来就在反对共同敌人的斗争中结成和发展的。
    这种友谊和团结，在朝鲜人民反对美国帝国主义武装侵略者和李承晚卖国匪帮的正义的祖国解放战争中，和战后时期通过朝中经济及文化合作协定更加巩固和发展起来了。
    在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义武装侵略者和李承晚卖国叛徒的艰苦的祖国解放战争时期，伟大的中国人民高举抗美援朝的旗帜，不仅给战争中的朝鲜人民以物质上精神上的积极援助，并派遣由自己的优秀儿女所组成的英雄的中国人民志愿军到朝鲜战场来以鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    以正义的步伐来到朝鲜的英勇的中国人民志愿军指战员们，受到朝鲜人民热烈的支持和爱护，同朝鲜人民军将士们一起，在消灭共同的敌人的激烈的战斗中，发挥了无比的英雄主义，从敌人的侵害下保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，给敌人以军事、政治、道德上的沉重的打击，达成了停战的胜利，在保卫亚洲和世界和平的伟大事业中做出了巨大的贡献。
    今天，朝鲜人民向在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，树立了辉煌功绩而回国的一部分中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员们，表示亲密的友情和深深的感谢。
      英雄的中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员们所发挥的不朽的功勋和无产阶级国际主义的典范，将同我国的无穷无尽的繁荣一起永远活在我们人民的心里。中国人民为了迅速恢复和建设因战争而遭到严重破坏的我国人民经济，给予我们巨大的物质援助，并派遣很多的技术人员来帮助我们。中国人民给朝鲜人民的这种援助和以伟大的苏联为首的各人民民主国家的援助，在战后恢复建设和和平统一祖国的斗争中有巨大的贡献。
    由于各兄弟国家人民的高贵的援助而得到鼓舞的朝鲜人民，在过去一年来的恢复和建设人民经济的斗争中，已经获得了不少的成就。
    大小工厂、企业所、学校、医院等文化设施和住宅，到处建立起来，人民的生活已经获得安定和提高。在我国，建设新生活的人民，正在开展着创造性的劳动。朝鲜人民明确地知道，这一切成绩和伟大的中国人民莫大的援助是分不开的。
    值此中华人民共和国成立五周年之际，朝鲜人民对于兄弟般的中国人民表示更亲密的友谊，并向中国人民、中华人民共和国政府、中国共产党和中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志，致以崇高的敬意和感谢。亲爱的诸位：
    美帝国主义侵略者们看到朝鲜和印度支那的停战实现以后，亚洲局势获得某些缓和，亚洲人民的合作在和平共处的基础上有了进一步的加强，因而惊慌起来，便想尽一切办法企图恶化国际形势以继续维持世界紧张局势，因此唆使李承晚匪帮百方阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题，维持朝鲜的紧张局势。
    在这样的形势下，我们必须在维护和平事业中更加巩固和发展已经获得的胜利，暴露与粉碎侵略者们的冒险政策，以完成朝鲜人民日日夜夜所渴望的祖国的和平统一。
    像今天这样国际形势越是复杂，我们对敌人的警惕性也要百倍地提高。我们应进一步巩固以苏联为首的世界民主阵营之间的国际主义的友谊团结，特别是应进一步加强朝中两国人民之间以鲜血结成的友谊团结。任何力量也不可摧毁的朝中两国人民之间的钢铁般的团结，定将粉碎企图破坏我们正义的伟大事业的敌人的任何阴谋，更加胜利地促进和平统一我国和维护与巩固亚洲和平的事业。
    最后，在人民中国的光荣节日，我代表朝鲜人民热烈地庆祝伟大的中国人民在加强自己的人民民主国家的力量和建设社会主义的斗争中，在解放台湾和保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，获得更辉煌的成就。
    伟大的中华人民共和国成立五周年纪念万岁！
    朝中两国人民永世不灭的传统的友谊团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的不可战胜的和平阵营万岁！
    中华人民共和国政府、中国共产党和伟大的中国人民及其领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
