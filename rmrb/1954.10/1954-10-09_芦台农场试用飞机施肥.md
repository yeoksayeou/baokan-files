    Lutai Farm in Hebei Province is experimenting with aerial fertilization. On September 15th, an aircraft equipped with a fertilizer spraying device carried ammonium sulfate chemical fertilizer and conducted a fertilization test on 250 mu of land about to be sown with winter wheat. The aircraft fertilized 26 or 27 mu of land every four to five minutes, which was not only highly efficient but also sprayed the fertilizer very evenly. The successful aerial fertilization experiment has created favorable conditions for reducing costs and increasing grain production in China's agricultural production.

    芦台农场试用飞机施肥
    国营河北省芦台农场试用飞机施肥。九月十五日，装置着喷肥器的飞机载着硫酸錏化学肥料，在即将播种冬小麦的二百五十亩土地上作施肥试验。飞机每四、五分钟施肥二十六、七亩地，不仅效率高，而且喷的很均匀。飞机施肥试验成功给我国农业生产降低成本、增产粮食创造了有利条件。（新华社）
