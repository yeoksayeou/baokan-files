Hunan Province Actively Prepares to Restore Dikes and Embankments Along Lakes and Rivers

Hunan Province convened a conference on the restoration of dikes and embankments in lake and river areas in early October. More than 120 representatives attending the meeting earnestly discussed and studied the work of restoring breached embankments around Dongting Lake, and determined the plan for the Dongting Lake dike and embankment restoration project this winter and next spring. The plan requires over 60 million cubic meters of earthwork, over 170,000 cubic meters of stonework, and more than ten medium and small-sized culvert gates. It is necessary to mobilize more than 700,000 people to participate in the restoration project. Upon completion of this project on schedule and to standard, more than 6 million mu of fertile land will be restored to production, and more than 300,000 mu of cultivated land can be added. Most of the dikes and embankments can basically resist the 1949 flood level, and in the case of a flood volume equivalent to that of 1949, more than 500,000 mu of embankment fields can be ensured against breaching and flooding. It can also systematically control a flood storage capacity of 5 billion cubic meters.

In order to centralize and unify leadership, the province has established the Dongting Lake Dike and Embankment Restoration Engineering Committee and the Provincial Headquarters. The Provincial Headquarters began operations on October 6th and will move to the construction site in mid-October. It is now actively drawing up manpower, preparing and allocating materials, and doing various preparatory work in order to start full-scale construction in November. (Cai Deying)

    湖南省积极准备修复滨湖沿江的堤垸
    湖南省于十月上旬召开了滨湖沿江地区堤垸修复工作会议。出席会议的一百二十多名代表认真地讨论和研究了洞庭湖溃垸修复工作，确定了今冬明春洞庭湖堤垸修复工程的方案。计划需要土方六千余万公方，石方十七余万公方，中、小型涵闸十余座，需动员七十余万人民参加修复工程。这一工程按期按标准完成后，六百余万亩良田恢复生产，并可增加耕地三十余万亩。可使大部堤垸基本上能抗御一九四九年洪水位，在相当一九四九年洪水量的情况下，亦可确保五十余万亩垸田不致溃渍。还可有计划地控制蓄洪容量五十亿公方。
    为了集中统一领导，省成立了洞庭湖堤垸修复工程委员会和省指挥部，省指挥部已于十月六日开始办公，十月中旬即迁往工地，现正积极抽调人力，筹备和调配物资，做好各项准备工作，以便在十一月间全面开工。　（蔡德莹）
