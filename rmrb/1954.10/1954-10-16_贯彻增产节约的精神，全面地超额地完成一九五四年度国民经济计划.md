    Relying on the strenuous efforts of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and other working people, as well as cadres at all levels, the national economic construction work in the first three quarters of 1954 has achieved tremendous success. Now is the last quarter of 1954, and the task before us is to further implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing strict economy, and to comprehensively fulfill and strive to overfulfill the 1954 plan.

    We must do this because: First, we must make up for the agricultural production reduction and other losses caused by this year's floods. Second, the production plans of many factories and mines were not well completed in the third quarter, and some even failed to complete the output plan for three consecutive months; even more factories and mines failed to complete the production and financial plans. In particular, some key capital construction projects did not complete the construction plan in the first half of the year, and there were also more quality accidents. This situation must be changed. Third, whether in industrial, commercial, transportation, cultural and educational, and health departments, or in capital construction, the phenomenon of not seriously saving and not paying attention to implementing economic accounting is still relatively common, and many wastes have not been effectively overcome and stopped. Fourth, we have the great task of liberating Taiwan, which requires a stronger guarantee of material resources. Fifth, in order to ensure the progress and speed required by the basic tasks of the Five-Year Plan, 1955 will be a very important and tense year for China's first Five-Year Plan, requiring us to start preparing in all aspects now; and comprehensively and over fulfilling the 1954 plan can prepare favorable conditions for implementing the 1955 plan.

    So, what specific work should we carry out?

    In terms of industrial production, under the general requirement of strengthening enterprise management and comprehensively fulfilling and over fulfilling the national plan, special attention must be paid to the balance between supply, production, and sales, and to better completing the cost and financial plans.

    The imbalance between supply, production, and sales of certain products is a relatively prominent problem in industrial production in 1954. The reasons for this situation are, on the one hand, that China's new industry has not yet been built, the old industry has not yet been technically transformed, and agriculture is still backward, so it is difficult to completely avoid the imbalance between supply, production, and sales, and production not keeping up with demand will be a problem that can only be solved over a long period; but on the other hand, it is also due to the fact that some production departments and demand departments have shortcomings in their work, such as insufficient planning, weak organization, poor coordination, and slow improvement in technical level. This has resulted in the stockpiling of some industrial products that could have been not stockpiled or stockpiled less. Therefore, increasing production and practicing economy in industry must first strengthen planning. Products for which there is social demand and a guarantee of raw material supply should actively increase production, while products with insufficient raw material supply or poor sales should be appropriately controlled and produced according to the original plan. Appropriate methods should be taken to gradually dispose of already stockpiled products. The machinery industry department has already done a lot of work in studying social needs, arranging production, and handling certain stockpiled products, and should continue to work hard.

    Secondly, it is necessary to save those raw materials that are in short supply and research and adopt suitable substitutes on the premise of ensuring quality. The Ministry of Textile Industry has stipulated that the average raw cotton consumption per yarn should be reduced by two liang from 395 liang starting from October this year, and the Ministry of Light Industry has also stipulated that the tobacco leaf consumption per case of cigarettes should be reduced by one jin from 125 jin. These are very timely measures, and state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private textile factories and cigarette factories should resolutely implement them, and private textile factories and cigarette factories should also implement them as much as possible. Other industrial departments and local state-owned industries should also make appropriate regulations on saving raw material consumption.

    Thirdly, it is also necessary to rationally organize technical forces, strengthen leadership, organize collaboration, conduct timely inspections, and vigorously complete the trial production and manufacturing tasks of new products. The Ministry of Heavy Industry recently conducted a relatively comprehensive inspection of the trial production and manufacturing work of new products, discovered many problems, and redeployed technical forces, strengthened leadership, and promoted the progress of the trial production and manufacturing work of new products based on the analysis of the situation. Other industrial departments should also carry out the same work.

    The reduction of industrial product costs must reach the targets stipulated in the national plan and strive to exceed them. The main reasons for high costs are that labor is not well organized in enterprises, there are too many non-production personnel, the production process is improperly arranged, there is waste of materials, fuel and power consumption is too high, the proportion of management expenses and other non-production expenses is relatively large, capital turnover is not fast, and there are too many defective products and rejects, etc., and these bad phenomena cannot be effectively overcome. Therefore, all state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private industrial enterprises must conduct an inspection and analysis of the cost and financial plans in the fourth quarter, improve management work, solve the main problems that affect cost reduction, strive to over fulfill this year's cost and financial plans, and ensure that the product cost next year is further reduced on the basis of this year, so that the profits turned over can be increased.

    All production factories and mines must do a good job in equipment maintenance and necessary preparation work to facilitate next year's production.

    In terms of capital construction, on the premise of ensuring project quality, efforts should be made to complete the construction progress plan. In the south, we should actively prepare for and strive to carry out more construction in winter; in the cold north, all those that have certain conditions and must carry out winter construction, especially key projects, should learn and promote advanced winter construction experience and implement winter construction, so as to minimize the carry-over of projects and strive for key projects to complete this year's construction plan. All capital construction units should earnestly check and overcome the waste and stockpiling of materials and equipment, improve construction management, rationally organize labor, save material consumption, promote advanced construction methods, and make full use of existing machinery and equipment to ensure the completion and strive to over fulfill this year's task of reducing construction and installation costs by 8%. The materials and equipment, and the organization of technical forces, required for next year's capital construction, especially key projects, should be properly arranged according to the specific needs of construction.

    In terms of agriculture, we should rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, unite all peasants, and launch an increase production campaign and a production disaster relief campaign. Grasping the autumn harvest and organizing careful harvesting and threshing will greatly increase grain income. The entire Inner Mongolia region has put forward the task of increasing grain production by 220 million jin in addition to completing this year's grain production plan. We know that if every mu of land across the country can lose two jin of grain less in harvesting and threshing, the country can harvest more than 3 billion jin. Generally speaking, it is possible to lose two jin of grain less per mu. There are still many places that have not yet carried out the autumn harvest, and those that have already carried out the autumn harvest have not completely ended it. Every agricultural production cooperative, mutual aid group, and individual farmer should strive to harvest two jin of grain more per mu, and state-owned farms should strive to greatly exceed this goal.

    In disaster-stricken areas, we should actively lead farmers to help each other, promote the spirit of collectivism, implement production for self-salvation, drain accumulated water, build ponds and dams, strive to replant late autumn crops, vegetables, and spring harvest crops in a timely manner, develop sideline production, and make good use of disaster relief funds to carry out work such as blocking breaches and restoring embankments.

    After the autumn harvest, necessary rectification and consolidation work should be carried out on the agricultural production cooperatives that have been organized, summarize experience, and develop a new batch of agricultural production cooperatives on this basis. This winter, special attention should be paid to helping farmers prepare fertilizers and seeds, repair farm tools, plan for land reclamation, utilize waste land, and allocate the planting area of various crops, so as to prepare for next year's spring plowing; this work is especially important in disaster areas.

    In terms of commerce, after the autumn harvest in rural areas, we should do a good job in purchasing agricultural products, while ensuring the supply of necessities in rural areas and developing the circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas. The unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton have just begun, and leadership should be strengthened and specific plans should be made to ensure the completion of the cotton purchase task and that cotton cloth can be supplied in a timely manner. We must actively promote the products of state-owned and local state-owned industries, and especially open up sales channels for stockpiled products; the processing, ordering, and product purchase of private industries should be strengthened in planning, and handicrafts should also be purchased in a planned manner.

    This year, state-owned commercial departments have stipulated the task of increasing the capital turnover rate by 0.24 times and reducing the commodity circulation cost rate by 17.53%. This must be guaranteed to be completed and strive to exceed, so as to increase the profits turned over. This requires making greater achievements in organizing the rational allocation of commodities, reducing storage and transportation losses, handling slow-moving and inferior goods, and reducing miscellaneous expenses.

    In order to increase the supply of non-staple foods to important industrial and mining areas and large cities, state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises in large cities and industrial and mining areas should cooperate with rural areas in nearby counties and districts to arrange vegetable, meat, and egg production tasks, sign pre-purchase contracts, and gradually promote the zoning supply of non-staple foods.

    In terms of transportation, the railway department should further strengthen the organization and leadership of transportation, especially improve the dispatching work in the busy sections of freight transportation, organize rational transportation, reduce the empty car travel rate, improve loading efficiency, and over fulfill the transportation task and financial plan. In the north, full preparations should be made to ensure the completion of the winter transportation task.

    Jianghai transportation should strengthen the connection between ships, ports, and cargo owners, organize balanced transportation, eliminate the phenomenon of repeated transportation, shorten the non-production berthing time of ships, and ensure the completion of the annual plan. Due to the impact of floods, the materials stockpiled in the second and third quarters should fully utilize the potential power of existing shipping equipment in the fourth quarter to complete the transportation task.

    In addition to the above-mentioned main economic departments, other economic departments and cultural and educational, and political and legal departments should also formulate corresponding methods in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy to improve their work and save all unnecessary and unimportant expenses for the country to the greatest extent possible, and increase possible and legitimate income. Party organizations and leading organs of the government at all levels should vigorously support the financial system, strengthen financial supervision, control expenditures, and fight against all phenomena of wasting state property.

    Past experience has proved that in order to achieve great results in increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the broad masses, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and engage in labor with the spirit of patriotism. At the same time, increasing production and practicing economy must be carried out under leadership, and the labor enthusiasm and creative spirit of the masses must be directed towards the goal of comprehensively and over fulfilling the national plan, combined with improving the level of enterprise management and improving leadership methods, paying attention to practical results and the overall and long-term interests, and avoiding temporary crash tactics. Past experience has also proved that in order to achieve great results in increasing production and practicing economy, there must be concrete measures that are practical and feasible, to overcome the current weak links and solve the current main problems, and carry out hard work in depth. It must not be just a general call or a general mobilization.

    In the fourth quarter of this year, on the basis of past work, the masses should be mobilized to increase production and practice economy, so that the national economic plan for 1954 can be completed better. However, increasing production and practicing economy is a long-term task in our economic construction, not just a task for the fourth quarter. We must implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy into all aspects of future work, promote successful experiences, stipulate necessary systems, and continuously revise and supplement the established systems as the content of increasing production and practicing economy is gradually enriched and enriched.

    We believe that under the battle call of completing the basic tasks of China's first Five-Year Plan, the people of the whole country will definitely work harder and achieve greater achievements.

### 贯彻增产节约的精神，全面地超额地完成一九五四年度国民经济计划

    贯彻增产节约的精神，全面地超额地完成一九五四年度国民经济计划
    依靠广大工人、农民和其它劳动人民及各级干部的紧张努力，一九五四年前三个季度的国家经济建设工作已取得了巨大的成绩。现在是一九五四年的最后一个季度，摆在我们面前的任务就是要进一步贯彻增加生产、厉行节约的精神，全面完成并争取超额完成一九五四年的计划。
    我们所以必须这样做，是因为：第一，今年水灾造成的农业减产和其它方面的损失，我们必须把它弥补起来。第二，许多厂矿第三季度的生产计划完成得不好，有的甚至连续三个月没有完成产量计划；没有完成生产财务计划的厂矿更多。特别是有些重点的基本建设工程在上半年没有完成施工计划，质量事故也比较多，这种情况必须改变。第三，不论工业、商业、交通运输、文教卫生等部门或是在基本建设中，那种不认真节约和不注意贯彻经济核算的现象还比较普遍，许多浪费仍没有得到有效的克服和制止。第四，在我们面前摆着解放台湾的伟大任务，需要更强大的物质资源的保证。第五，为了保证五年计划基本任务所要求的进度和速度，一九五五年将是我国第一个五年计划很关重要和很紧张的一年，需要我们现在就着手在各个方面做好准备工作；而全面地超额地完成一九五四年的计划就能够为实行一九五五年的计划准备有利的条件。
    那么，我们应该进行那些具体工作呢？
    工业生产方面，在加强企业管理，全面完成和超额完成国家计划这个总要求之下，必须特别注意供产销之间的平衡和更好地完成成本、财务计划。
    若干产品在供产销之间的不平衡是一九五四年工业生产方面一个比较突出的问题。造成这种情况的原因，一方面固然由于我国新的工业还没有建设起来，旧的工业还没有得到技术的改造，农业也还落后，供产销之间发生不平衡的现象是难以完全避免的，而且生产赶不上需要将是长时期才能解决的一个问题；但另一方面，也由于某些生产部门和需要部门存在着计划不周详，组织性不强，配合协作得不好，以及技术水平提高得不快等等工作缺点。这就使得有一些工业产品本来可以不积压或少积压的积压了。因此，工业的增产节约，首先必须加强计划性。凡社会需要和原材料供应有保证的产品应积极增产，原材料供应不足或产品销路不好的产品应适当控制，按原定计划生产。已经积压的产品应采取适当方法逐步处理。机械工业部门在研究社会需要、安排生产及处理某些积压产品等方面已经进行了不少工作，应继续努力。
    其次，必须在保证质量的条件下，节用那些供应不足的原材料，研究和采用适用的代用品。纺织工业部已规定从今年十月份起每件纱的平均原棉消耗量由三九五斤减少二斤，轻工业部也已规定每箱卷烟的烟叶消耗量由一二五斤减少一斤，这是很适时的措施，国营、地方国营、公私合营的纺织厂和卷烟厂都应坚决执行，私营的纺织厂和卷烟厂也应尽可能地实行。其它工业部门和地方国营工业，也应该在节用原材料消耗方面作出适当的规定。
    再其次，还必须合理地组织技术力量，加强领导，组织协作，及时检查，大力完成新产品的试制和制造任务。重工业部最近对新产品试制和制造工作进行了一次比较全面的检查，发现了不少问题，并根据对情况的分析重新布置了技术力量，加强了领导，推动了新产品试制和制造工作的进行。其它工业部门也应该进行同样的工作。
    工业产品成本的降低必须达到国家计划规定的指标并争取超额。成本高的主要原因是企业中劳动组织得不好，非生产人员过多，生产过程安排不当，物资和材料有浪费，燃料和动力消耗过多，管理费用和其它非生产开支占的比重较大，资金周转不快，以及废品和次品较多等等不良现象不能有效地得到克服。因此，一切国营、地方国营、公私合营工业企业，第四季度必须切实地对成本、财务计划进行一次检查和分析研究，改进管理工作，解决那些影响成本不能降低的主要问题，争取超额完成今年的成本、财务计划，并保证明年的产品成本在今年的基础上进一步降低，使上缴利润能够增加。
    一切生产厂矿必须做好设备的检修和必需的准备工作，以便利明年的生产。
    基本建设方面，在保证工程质量的前提下，应争取完成施工进度计划。在南方，应积极准备和争取冬季多施工；在气候寒冷的北方，凡具备一定条件和必须实行冬季施工的，特别是重点工程，都应学习和推广先进的冬季施工经验，实行冬季施工，以尽量减少结转工程，争取重点工程能完成今年的施工计划。所有基本建设单位都应该切实检查和克服材料、设备的浪费现象和积压现象，并改善施工管理工作，合理组织劳动力，节约物资的消耗，推广先进的施工方法，充分利用现有的机械设备，保证完成并争取超额完成今年降低建筑安装成本百分之八的任务。明年基本建设特别是重点工程所需的材料和设备，技术力量的组织，应根据建设的具体需要，妥为安排。
    农业方面，应该依靠互助合作组织，团结全体农民，展开增产运动和生产救灾运动。抓紧秋收，组织细收细打，对增加粮食收入有很大的作用。内蒙全区除完成今年粮食生产计划外，又提出了增产二亿二千万斤粮食的任务。我们知道，如果全国各地每亩地都能够在收割和打场中少损失二斤粮食，全国就可多收三十多亿斤。一般地说，每亩地少损失二斤粮食，是可以做到的。现在还有不少地方尚未进行秋收，已经进行秋收的也还没有完全结束，每一个农业生产合作社、互助组和每户单干农民，都应该为每亩多收二斤粮食而努力，国营农场应该争取大大超过这个目标。
    在遭灾的地区，应该积极领导农民互助互济，发扬集体主义精神，实行生产自救，排除积水，修筑塘坝，争取及时补种晚秋作物、蔬菜和春收作物，发展副业生产，并很好地利用赈款进行堵口复堤等工作。
    在秋收以后，应对已组织起来的农业生产合作社进行必要的整顿巩固工作，总结经验，并在这个基础上发展一批新的农业生产合作社。今冬应该特别注意帮助农民准备肥料和种籽，修补农具，筹划开荒，利用废地和分配各种作物的种植面积，为明年春耕做好准备；这一工作在灾区尤其紧要。
    商业方面，在农村秋收后，应做好农产品的收购工作，同时保证农村必需品的供应，发展城乡间的商品流转。棉布统购统销和棉花统购工作刚开始实行，更应加强领导，具体筹划，保证棉花收购任务的完成，棉布能及时供应。要积极推销国营和地方国营工业的产品，尤其有积压的产品应打开销路；对私营工业的加工、定货和产品收购应加强计划性，同时有计划地收购手工业产品。
    今年国营商业部门规定提高资金周转率零点二四次和降低商品流通费用率百分之十七点五三的任务，必须保证完成并争取超过，以增加上缴利润。这样就要求在组织商品合理调拨、减少储运损失、处理冷残背次货及减少杂费开支等方面做出更大的成绩。
    为增加重要工矿区和大城市副食品的供应，大城市和工矿区的国营、合作社商业企业应与附近县区的农村配合布置蔬菜、肉、蛋等生产任务，订立预购合同，逐步推行副食品的分区供应办法。
    交通运输方面，铁路部门应进一步加强运输的组织领导，特别是改进货运繁忙的主要区段的调度工作，组织合理运输，降低空车行走率，提高装车效率，超额完成运输任务和财务计划。在北方，应进行充分的准备工作，保证冬季运输任务的完成。
    江海运输应加强船、港、货主三者之间的联系，组织均衡运输，消灭重复运输的现象，缩短船舶的非生产停泊时间，保证全年计划的完成。由于水灾影响在第二、第三季度积压的物资，在第四季度应充分发挥现有航运设备的潜在力量，完成运输任务。
    除上述主要经济部门以外，其它经济部门和文教、政法部门，都应按照增加生产、厉行节约的精神，定出相应的办法，来提高自己的工作，并最大限度地为国家节约一切不必要的和不紧要的开支，增加可能的和正当的收入。各级党的组织和政府的领导机关，应大力支持财务系统，加强财务监督，控制支出，和一切浪费国家财物的现象进行斗争。
    以往的经验证明，增产节约要取得巨大的效果，必须深入地发动广大群众，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，以爱国主义的精神来从事劳动。同时，增产节约必须有领导地去进行，必须把群众的劳动热情和创造精神引向全面和超额完成国家计划这一目标，与提高企业管理水平和改进领导方法相结合，重视实际效果和整体的长远的利益，避免一时突击的作法。以往的经验还证明，增产节约要取得巨大的效果，必须有切实可行的、为克服当前薄弱环节和解决当前主要问题的具体措施，深入地进行艰苦的工作，决不能只是一般的号召，泛泛的动员。
    今年第四季度应该在过去工作的基础上，发动群众增加生产，厉行节约，使一九五四年的国民经济计划完成得更好。但增产节约是我们经济建设中长期的任务，不能只是第四季度的任务。我们必须把增产节约的精神贯彻到今后工作的各个方面，推广成功的经验，规定必要的制度，并随着增产节约内容的逐渐丰富和充实，使已定的制度不断得到修正和补充。
    我们相信，在完成我国第一个五年计划基本任务的战斗号召之下，全国人民一定能够更加努力，取得更大的成就。
