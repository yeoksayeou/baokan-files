(Xinhua News Agency, October 15th) A reporter from this agency reports: Facts, after investigation, prove that U.S. Representative to the United Nations, Lodge, slandered the People's Republic of China on September 19th for attacking foreign ships and aircraft. One of his purposes was to cover up the U.S. aggression group's infringement upon China's territorial sovereignty and the U.S.'s collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in hijacking and firing upon merchant ships on the high seas in acts of piracy.

It has been ascertained that in the thirty-nine incidents listed by Lodge, the actual circumstances of twelve incidents are completely contrary to what Lodge stated. In these incidents, American aircraft and warships blatantly intruded into China's airspace and territorial waters, engaging in armed provocations against the Chinese people, and consequently suffered the punishment they deserved. It was not, as Lodge falsely claimed, that the Chinese people shot at them without cause. The following are a few more prominent examples:

On January 18, 1953, an American aircraft intruded into the airspace over Jinghai, south of Shantou, China, and circled for reconnaissance at an altitude as low as 500 meters. The People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces immediately retaliated against this provocation. Under the pretext of rescuing this aircraft, an American warship even intruded into China's territorial waters. The People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces immediately fired a warning shot. When mentioning this incident, Lodge made no attempt to conceal the fact that American aircraft had intruded into China's airspace, but he attempted to make people believe that the solemn self-defense measures taken by the Chinese people were so-called "acts of violence." This fully demonstrates how the U.S. aggression group represented by Lodge disregards the territorial sovereignty of other countries.

Similarly, on March 21, 1953, Americans Richard Applegate, Benjamin Klasner, Donald Dixon, and others, sailing the American yacht "Cutter," intruded into China's Guangdong territorial waters for reconnaissance activities and were immediately detained by the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces. During the interrogation, Applegate and the other two all confessed to the crime of infringing upon China's territorial waters and were deported in September 1954. However, Lodge avoided explaining the specific circumstances at the time and vaguely slandered China for "intercepting" the "Cutter."

The same situation exists in the incidents involving British ships listed by Lodge. For example:

On November 2, 1952, British sailors Cresswell and Wise, travelling from Hong Kong by naval rowboat, intruded into China's territorial waters near Wai Lingding Island and were immediately arrested and interrogated by the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces. After writing confessions, these two British sailors were deported on March 19, 1953. However, Lodge described these two men, who the British government acknowledged were naval sailors in Hong Kong, as "two British sailors on a whaling boat" and concealed the fact that they had intruded into China's territorial waters.

Again, on June 1, 1954, nine British naval personnel in a boat intruded into China's territorial waters 200 meters northeast of Ma Huan, northwest of Sanmen Island, for reconnaissance. They were immediately detained by the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces. Afterwards, Mr. D.W. Kermode, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, expressed regret to the Chinese government that the nine British naval personnel had entered China's territorial waters. These nine British naval personnel were claimed by the Hong Kong British authorities on July 10, 1954, upon presentation of a receipt. However, Lodge insisted on portraying this incident as an example of China exerting "aggressive pressure," which is utterly absurd.

In the thirty-nine incidents listed by Lodge, a total of five incidents have been found to be misunderstandings. These include the incident on July 23, 1954, when a British passenger plane was mistakenly identified as a plane of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and shot down over Hainan Island. Another example is the incident on April 16, 1951, when the British ship "Victoria Peak" anchored near Wai Lingding Island, outside China's territorial waters, in dense fog. The People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces mistakenly identified it as an enemy ship and immediately fired a warning shot. On June 8, 1951, the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces mistakenly fired upon the Danish ship "Marisco," and the Chinese government subsequently took responsibility for repairing and compensating the ship.

Most of the above-mentioned incidents caused by misunderstandings have been resolved through consultations between the Chinese government and the parties concerned. Lodge insists on repeatedly discussing these incidents and deliberately exaggerating them, calling them so-called "violent incidents," the purpose of which is nothing more than to create a tense atmosphere.

It should be pointed out that the reason why these misunderstandings occurred is entirely due to the constant provocative activities carried out by the U.S. aggression group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under its protection along the Chinese coast, which force the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces to maintain a high degree of vigilance against all ships and aircraft entering China's territorial waters and airspace, preparing for self-defense. Therefore, the responsibility for all these misunderstandings should be borne entirely by the U.S. aggression group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who created the tense situation along the Chinese coast.

In the thirty-nine incidents listed by Lodge, twenty-two incidents are completely fabricated out of thin air. For example, Lodge said that on August 13, 1950, an aircraft painted with the American national emblem was shot at by machine guns on an island near Macau. However, at that time, there was no incident of shooting at aircraft near Macau. On the contrary, Lodge admitted here that American aircraft had intruded into China's airspace. Lodge fabricated these incidents entirely to confuse the public and cover up the crimes of the U.S. aggression group colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to rob foreign merchant ships. Among the foreign merchant ships that Lodge falsely claimed to have been attacked by China, at least five British merchant ships—"South America," "New Prosperity," "Jen Hsiu Hua," "Edith Moller," and "Hang Tung"—have been found to have been detained, robbed, intercepted, and attacked by the Chiang bandits.

Facts prove that it is none other than the U.S. aggression group that infringes upon China's territorial waters and airspace along the Chinese coast and "consistently exerts aggressive pressure." It is none other than the U.S. aggression group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, who are directed and assisted by it, that have committed acts of piracy and robbed and intercepted merchant ships of various countries along the Chinese coast. From September 1949 to October 1954, at least sixty-seven merchant ships from ten countries have been looted and intercepted as many as 111 times by the U.S. aggression group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Faced with this fact, Lodge's shameless slander against the Chinese people is, of course, worthless.

### 美国驻联合国代表诬蔑我国袭击外国商船  企图掩饰美国侵略集团对我国的侵略行为

    美国驻联合国代表诬蔑我国袭击外国商船
    企图掩饰美国侵略集团对我国的侵略行为
    【新华社十五日讯】本社记者报道：经过调查以后的事实证明：美国驻联合国代表洛奇在九月十九日诬蔑中华人民共和国袭击外国船只和飞机，其目的之一是为了掩饰美国侵略集团对中国领土主权的侵犯和美国勾结蒋介石卖国集团在公海上拦劫、射击商船的海盗行为。
    已经查明：在洛奇所列举的三十九次事件中，有十二次事件的实际情况与洛奇所说的情况完全相反。在这些事件中，美国的飞机、军舰公然侵入中国的领空和领海，向中国人民进行武装挑衅，因而遭到了应得的惩罚，而并不是像洛奇所胡说的那样是中国人民无故射击它们。以下是几个比较突出的例子：
    一九五三年一月十八日，美国飞机一架侵入中国汕头以南靖海上空，并且低飞到五百公尺的高度盘旋侦察。人民解放军海防部队当即还击了这种挑衅。美国军舰借口营救这架飞机竟又侵入中国领海。人民解放军海防部队当即发炮予以警告。洛奇在提到这个事件时丝毫不想掩饰美国飞机侵入中国领空的事实，可是他却企图使人相信中国人民所采取的严正的自卫手段是所谓“暴力行为”，这充分表明了洛奇所代表的美国侵略集团是如何地蔑视其他国家领土主权的完整。
    同样情况的是：一九五三年三月二十一日，美国人理查德·阿普盖特、本杰明·克拉斯纳、唐纳德·狄克逊等三人驾驶美国游艇“克特号”侵入中国广东领海进行侦察活动，当即被人民解放军海防部队扣留。在审讯过程中，阿普盖特等三人都承认了侵犯中国领海的罪行，并在一九五四年九月被驱逐出境。而洛奇却避不交代当时的具体情形，含糊其词地诬蔑中国“截走了”“克特号”。
    在洛奇所列举的涉及到英国船只的事件中，也有同样的情形。例如：
    一九五二年十一月二日，英国水兵克列斯威尔和怀士由香港乘海军划船在外伶仃岛附近侵入中国领海，当即被人民解放军海防部队逮捕审讯。这两名英国水兵在出具悔过书后，已于一九五三年三月十九日驱逐出境。可是洛奇却把这两名英国政府都承认是它在香港的海军水兵的人，说成是什么“一只捕鲸船上的两名英国海员”，而且隐瞒了他们侵入中国领海的事实。
    又如一九五四年六月一日，英国海军人员九人乘船由香港侵入中国三门岛西北方马环前沿二百公尺处的中国领海内进行侦察，当即被人民解放军海防部队扣留。事后英国驻中国代办杜维廉曾向中国政府表示对英国海军人员九人进入中国领海表示遗憾。这九名英国海军人员已于一九五四年七月十日由香港英国当局出具收据领回。可是洛奇却把这个事件硬说是中国施用“侵略性的压力”的例子，岂非荒谬到了极点。
    在洛奇所列举的三十九件事件中，已经查明属于误会性质的共有五起。其中包括一九五四年七月二十三日一架英国客机在海南岛上空被误认为蒋介石卖国集团飞机而遭击落的事件。又如一九五一年四月十六日，英国船“维多利亚山峰号”在浓雾中停泊于中国领海外伶仃岛附近，人民解放军海防部队误认为敌舰，当即予以发炮警告。一九五一年六月八日，人民解放军海防部队误击丹麦船“马丽斯考号”，事后中国政府已经负责给这艘船修理赔偿。
    上述几次由于误会引起的事件，大部分已由中国政府和有关方面协商解决。洛奇硬要把这些事件翻来覆去地谈论不休，并且故意大加渲染，称之为所谓“暴力事件”，其目的无非是要借此制造紧张空气。
    应该指出，这些误会事件之所以发生，完全由于美国侵略集团以及它庇护下的蒋介石卖国集团在中国沿海不断进行挑衅活动，使中国人民解放军海防部队不能不对进入中国领海、领空的一切船只和飞机保持高度的警惕，准备自卫。因此所有这些误会事件的责任，完全应由在中国沿海制造紧张局势的美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团担负。
    在洛奇所列举的三十九次事件中，有二十二次事件完全是凭空捏造出来的。例如洛奇说：在一九五○年八月十三日，有一架漆有美国国徽的飞机遭到澳门附近海岛上的机枪射击。但是当时在澳门附近根本没有发生过射击飞机的事件，相反，洛奇倒在这里承认了美国飞机侵入中国领空的事实。洛奇捏造这些事件，完全是为了淆乱视听，掩饰美国侵略集团勾结蒋介石卖国集团抢劫外国商船的罪行。在洛奇捏造说是遭到过中国袭击的外国商船中，至少有五艘英国商船：“南美号”、“新兴号”、“仁秀华号”、“伊迪思·摩勒号”和“航通号”已经查明曾经被蒋贼军扣留、抢劫、拦截和袭击。
    事实证明，在中国沿海侵犯中国的领海领空，
  “一贯施用侵略性的压力”的，不是别人，正是美国侵略集团。在中国沿海犯有海盗行为，抢劫拦截各国商船的不是别人，正是美国侵略集团和得到它的指使和协助的蒋介石卖国集团。从一九四九年九月到一九五四年十月，已经至少有十个国家的商船六十七艘被美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国集团劫掠拦截了一百十一次之多。在这个事实面前，洛奇对中国人民的无耻诬蔑当然是一文不值。
