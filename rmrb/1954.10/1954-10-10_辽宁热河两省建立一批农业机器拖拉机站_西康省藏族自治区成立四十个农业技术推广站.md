Liaoning Province has established twelve agricultural machine tractor stations and two semi-mechanized agricultural technology extension stations. In the autumn of 1953, four tractor stations were established on a trial basis in Liaoyang, Kaiyuan, Haicheng, Shenyang, and other places. This year, eight tractor stations have been established in Yixian, Suizhong, Beizhen, Changtu, Heishan, Tieling, Gaiping, Haicheng, and other places. Currently, each tractor station is working with farmers to discuss contract farming. According to preliminary statistics, this autumn they will provide autumn plowing for 19 state-owned farms, 23 collective farms, and many agricultural production cooperatives, totaling 6,000 hectares, and thresh 3,400,000 catties of grain.

The original four tractor stations demonstrated the superiority of mechanized operations in contract farming and threshing operations last autumn and this spring. The Haicheng tractor station used tractors to plant three hectares of corn for the Five-Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guanfansi Village. The corn grew tall and thick, and most of them grew two ears. According to experienced farmers, each hectare is expected to yield about 10,000 catties of grain, an increase of about 25 percent compared to corn cultivated with old farm tools in the vicinity. The Eleventh District served by the Kaiyuan tractor station sows 2,000 to 3,000 hectares of wheat every year. In the past, the wheat harvest season coincided with the rainy season, causing great difficulties and losses for wheat harvesting and threshing. This year, the use of machine harvesting and threshing not only reduced the operation time but also greatly reduced the losses. The Zhaoguobin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qianshijiapu Village can harvest an average of 140 piculs of wheat each year. In the past, due to continuous rain, it took one and a half months to thresh the grain. This year, using a threshing machine, 100 piculs can be threshed in one day and night. The superiority of tractor operation has greatly encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for taking the road of collectivization. After visiting the tractor station, many farmers actively organized and participated in agricultural production cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency: Rehe Province has established an agricultural machine tractor station in Chifeng County, a major grain-producing area, and Chaoyang County, a major cotton-producing area. The construction work started in April this year and ended in mid-September. The two stations have a total of nine tractors and more than ten kinds of agricultural machines. At present, the two stations are busy repairing machines and farm tools, surveying land, and signing contract farming contracts with agricultural production cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency: The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province recently established forty agricultural technology extension stations in Kangding, Qianning, Daofu, Luhuo, Danba, Yajiang, and other counties. In addition to promoting new-style farm tools and guiding the improvement of farming techniques to Tibetan farmers, these agricultural technology extension stations will promote and organize labor exchange and mutual assistance based on the original labor exchange habits of Tibetan farmers in production to increase grain production; at the same time, they will assist local people's governments and production and security committees in publicizing ethnic policies and production policies.

In recent years, after vigorously reclaiming wasteland in Kangding, Qianning, and other six counties, farmers who lacked land or had no land have basically obtained land, and the large number of free iron farm tools distributed by the government have also significantly increased productivity. The original seven agricultural technology extension stations in these counties have promoted new-style walking plows and guided the improvement of farming techniques to Tibetan people, and some have also organized Tibetan people to exchange labor and mutual assistance, which has been welcomed by Tibetan farmers. This year, 52 Tibetan households in Xinduqiao Village, Kangding County, used new-style farm tools to cultivate and sow seeds and adopted new farming techniques. The yield of highland barley is expected to exceed more than twice the local average yield. Nearby farmers have asked the government to set up stations to help them cultivate. Some even traveled from hundreds of miles away to request assistance from agricultural technology extension stations. These newly established agricultural technology extension stations will be equipped with a large number of various new-style farm tools to initially meet the urgent needs of Tibetan farmers in various counties.

    辽宁热河两省建立一批农业机器拖拉机站
    西康省藏族自治区成立四十个农业技术推广站
    辽宁省已建立起十二处农业机器拖拉机站和两处半机械化农业技术推广站。一九五三年秋，在辽阳、开原、海城、沈阳等地试办了四处拖拉机站，今年，又在义县、绥中、北镇、昌图、黑山、铁岭、盖平、海城等地建立起八处拖拉机站。目前，各拖拉机站正和农民研究代耕工作。据初步统计，今秋将为十九个国营农场、二十三个集体农庄和很多农业生产合作社秋翻土地六千垧、脱谷三百四十万斤。
    原有的四个拖拉机站，在去秋和今春的代耕、脱谷作业中，都大大地显示了机械作业的优越性。海城拖拉机站用拖拉机给管饭寺村五星农业生产合作社种的三垧苞米，长得又高又粗，大部分都结两个棒子。据有经验的农民估计，每垧地可收粮食一万斤左右，比附近用旧农具耕种的苞米约可增产百分之二十五。开原拖拉机站服务的十一区，每年都播种两千到三千垧小麦，历年小麦收获期都赶上雨季，给小麦收割和脱粒带来很大困难，损失很大。今年，使用机器收割和脱粒，不仅缩减了作业时间，还大大减少了损失。前施家堡村赵国彬农业生产合作社每年平均可收一百四十石小麦，往年因雨水连绵脱谷需时一个半月，而今年使用一台脱谷机，一昼夜即打出一百石。拖拉机作业的优越性大大鼓舞了农民走合作化道路的积极性。许多农民在参观过拖拉机站以后，都积极地组织和参加了农业生产合作社。
    热河省在主要产粮区赤峰县和主要产棉区朝阳县各建立了一个农业机器拖拉机站。建站工作从今年四月开始，到九月中结束。两站共有拖拉机九部和十多种农业机器。目前，两站正紧张检修机器和农具、勘查土地，和农业生产合作社签订代耕合同。　（新华社）
    西康省藏族自治区最近在康定、乾宁、道孚、炉霍、丹巴、雅江等县成立了四十个农业技术推广站。这些农业技术推广站除了向藏族农民推广新式农具和指导改进耕作技术外，将根据藏族农民生产上原有的换工习惯，推广和组织换工互助，提高粮食产量；同时将协助各地人民政府和生产治安委员会宣传民族政策、生产政策。
    几年来，康定、乾宁等六个县经过大力开垦荒地，缺地无地的农民基本上都有了土地，政府发放的大批无偿铁质农具也使生产力显著提高。这些县里原有的七个农业技术推广站，曾经向藏民推广新式步犁和指导改进耕作技术，有的并组织藏民换工互助，受到了藏族农民的欢迎。康定县新都桥村五十二户藏民今年使用新式农具耕地播种和采用新的耕作技术，青稞产量预计可超过当地一般产量的两倍以上，附近农民都纷纷要求政府设站，帮助他们耕种，有的从百里以外跑来请求农业技术推广站帮助耕作。这些新成立的农业技术推广站都将配备大批各种新式农具，以初步满足各县藏族农民的迫切要求。　（新华社）
