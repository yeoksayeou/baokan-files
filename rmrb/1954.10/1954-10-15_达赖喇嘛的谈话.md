The agreements reached between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Soviet Union through consultations are of great benefit to the growing strength of world peace and democracy, the increasingly close unity between China and the Soviet Union, and the development of our country's economic and cultural undertakings. Therefore, I, on behalf of the monks and lay people of Tibet, express my complete support with heartfelt and boundless excitement.

The people of the Soviet Union and China both love world peace and democracy. For several years, the governments of China and the Soviet Union have been working hard to ensure world peace and promote democracy. This time, the governments of China and the Soviet Union, on foreign affairs, once again solemnly declared the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence. If all countries in the world can abide by these fair and reasonable principles, world peace can be ensured without doubt.

Other agreements, such as the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the two governments, the joint communiqué on the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway, the joint communiqué of the governments of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia on the construction of a railway from Jining to Ulaanbaatar and the organization of joint transportation, the agreement on the Soviet government granting the government of the People's Republic of China a long-term loan of 520 million rubles, and the protocol on the Soviet Union assisting the government of the People's Republic of China in building 15 new industrial enterprises and expanding the scope of equipment supply for the original 141 enterprises stipulated in the agreement, etc. These selfless and strong assistance from the Soviet government to our country will enable our country's economic, cultural, and other construction undertakings to achieve solid development and will make the unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union even more consolidated. This assistance is based on Sino-Soviet friendship, and the Soviet government's sincere and selfless assistance to our government makes us feel heartfelt trust and boundless excitement.

    达赖喇嘛的谈话
    这次中华人民共和国政府和苏联政府经会谈所达成的各项协议，对于世界和平民主力量的日益增长，中苏两国之间的团结日趋亲密，对我国的经济和文化事业的发展都是有着很大的利益的，因而我代表西藏僧俗人民以由衷的无限兴奋的心情表示完全拥护。
    苏联和中国人民都是爱好世界和平和民主的，几年来中苏两国政府一直为确保世界和平和发扬民主而努力。这次中苏两国政府在对外问题上，又一次郑重声明互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处的原则，如果世界各国都能遵守这个公平合理的原则，则世界和平是能够确保无疑的。
    其他如两国政府关于科学技术合作的协定，修建兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路的联合公报，中、苏、蒙三国政府关于修建从集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路并组织联运的联合公报，关于苏联政府给予中华人民共和国政府五亿二千万卢布长期贷款的协定，关于苏联帮助中华人民共和国政府新建十五项工业企业，和扩大原有协定规定的一百四十一项企业设备的供应范围的议定书等，这些苏联政府给予我国的无私的大力帮助，将使我国的经济和文化等建设事业得到坚实的发展，将使中苏两国人民的团结更加巩固，这次帮助是在中苏友好的基础上，苏联政府给予我国政府的真诚无私的帮助，我们为此而感到由衷的信任和无限兴奋。
