Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 18th: After returning to Hanoi following eight years of war, Chairman Ho Chi Minh met with over a hundred representatives from various people's organizations and circles in the capital on the afternoon of the 16th, and delivered a speech to them. The representatives included workers, suburban farmers, youth and students, children, women, religious figures, people from the press and cultural and educational circles, doctors, lawyers, enlightened gentry, former civil servants, and industrialists and businessmen. Many of these representatives (especially worker and farmer representatives) had heard Chairman Ho declare the "Declaration of Independence" eight years ago and fought to defend the capital. Upon Chairman Ho Chi Minh's arrival, the representatives stood up excitedly and welcomed him with warm and prolonged applause.

In his speech, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: After eight years of resistance, I am very happy to meet with the people of the capital again today. I ask you to convey my warmest greetings to all the citizens of the capital.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: The work of recovering the capital has been successfully completed. This is due to the enthusiasm and discipline of our soldiers and cadres, and to the efforts of the people of the capital and their active assistance to the soldiers and cadres. On behalf of the government, I thank and congratulate all the people of the capital.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: After eighty years of foreign rule and eight years of war imposed on us by foreigners, we have now restored a peaceful life. This is a huge change. We will inevitably encounter many difficulties, but these difficulties are on the road to progress, and we must recognize this and resolutely overcome them.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: Our regime is a democratic regime, and every task of the government must serve the interests of the people. That is why the people have an obligation to assist the government, obey the law, and correctly implement the government's policies, so that the government can accomplish all the tasks entrusted to it by the people.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: Unity is our strength. We must unite closely and broadly: unity between the government and the people; unity between people of all strata; unity between the people of North and South Vietnam; unity between our people and the people of friendly countries. By closely uniting domestic and foreign forces, we will surely overcome all difficulties.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh concluded: I believe that the people of our capital, with their glorious revolutionary tradition and ardent patriotism, will actively strive to set a good example and play a leading role in the cause of consolidating peace, achieving unification, and striving for national independence and democracy.

His speech was constantly interrupted by applause.

Subsequently, many representatives spoke in succession. They all expressed deep gratitude to Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Vietnam People's Army, and unanimously stated that they would welcome Chairman Ho's return with achievements in increasing production, studying well, and working well, and would respond to Chairman Ho's call to continue to struggle for the cause of peace, independence, unity, and democracy in Vietnam.

    胡志明主席说：在经过八十年的外国统治和外国强加于我们身上的八年战争以后，我们现在已恢复了和平生活。这是一个巨大的改变。我们不得不遇到许多困难，但是这些困难是前进道路上的困难，我们必须认识到这一点并且坚决克服它。
    胡志明主席说：我们的政权是民主的政权，政府的每一项工作都要为人民的利益服务。这便是为什么人民有义务来协助政府，服从法律，并正确地执行政府的政策，以便政府能完成人民所交托给它的一切任务。
    胡志明主席说：团结是我们的力量。我们必须紧密而广泛地团结：政府和人民之间的团结；各阶层人民间的团结；北越和南越人民间的团结；我国人民和友好国家人民之间的团结。紧密地团结起国内外的力量，我们一定会克服一切困难。
