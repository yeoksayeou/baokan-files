    The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Calls on the City to Launch a Production Increase and Savings Movement
    Guaranteeing the Comprehensive Completion of this Year's National Plan
    The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision on September 27th, calling on the entire city to launch a production increase and savings movement to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's national plan.
    This summer, the people of Wuhan overcame the unprecedented severe flood threat since hydrological records began, ensuring the safety of national construction and the lives and property of the people in the Wuhan area. This victory is of great significance. However, the floods have brought considerable difficulties to various tasks in Wuhan. In terms of capital construction, more than 50% of the civil engineering and construction tasks still need to be completed in the fourth quarter or postponed to next spring. Some key projects will also have to be appropriately delayed compared to the original plan. In terms of industrial production, during the intense flood prevention struggle in the third quarter, production leadership work was inevitably somewhat relaxed, product quality was poor, raw material consumption was excessive, and product specifications and financial cost indicators were generally poorly completed. In terms of financial and trade work, the tasks for the fourth quarter are also very heavy. Due to the disaster caused by the floods in the suburbs and surrounding vast rural areas, there will still be many difficulties in future supply and sales work. In response to this situation, the Wuhan Municipal Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Committee, decided to launch the working class, working people, and the masses of the people in the city in the fourth quarter to carry out a production increase and savings movement to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's national plan, create good conditions for welcoming next year's national plan, and use this to support disaster areas, support rural areas, and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    The Wuhan Municipal Committee pointed out that the overall goal of launching the production increase and savings movement is to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan, not to increase production value without limit beyond the national plan, but to increase income by improving technology, ensuring quality, and reducing costs within the scope of the national plan's control. Except for units that need to increase production and have the possibility of increasing production according to national needs, which can increase production in a planned way with the approval of higher authorities, it is generally not required to increase production. According to this policy, the Wuhan Municipal Committee decided that in terms of capital construction, it is necessary to conduct another round of project prioritization to concentrate efforts on key projects. In terms of industrial production, efforts should be made to ensure quality, reduce costs, and strive to comprehensively complete various indicators. In terms of finance and trade, trade work should vigorously improve business management, reduce commodity circulation costs, accelerate capital turnover, and increase reasonable profits to ensure the completion of the national income plan and effectively serve production. Banking work should vigorously organize currency withdrawal, promote savings, and strengthen financial supervision of enterprises. In terms of financial work, efforts should be made to complete tax revenue tasks and reduce unnecessary expenditures. In terms of suburban agricultural and handicraft production, a movement to organize production for self-salvation should be carried out through the path of mutual assistance and cooperation. The Wuhan Municipal Committee also called on the city to widely launch a savings and disaster relief movement, especially to do a good job in raising winter clothes and saving electricity, to support farmers in disaster areas and industrial construction.
    In order to ensure the smooth development of the production increase and savings movement, the Wuhan Municipal Committee instructed party organizations at all levels to make efforts to do the following work:
    First, strengthen political and ideological work. The general requirement of the party's political work is to ensure the completion of the national plan and to continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the masses. Therefore, in the production increase and savings movement, it is necessary to first give play to the initiative and creativity of cadres and the masses, give play to the positive factors in the work of the past few years and the flood prevention struggle, and maintain the healthy morale and strong fighting spirit of the party and the masses. In the production increase and savings movement, it is also necessary to constantly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to prevent and oppose complacency and conservative ideas in industrial production, and to oppose the blind and rash tendency of seeking more and faster results in capital construction. In the production increase and savings movement, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to carry out labor emulation campaigns in a planned way under the guidance of the plan. Second, improve the level of business management. Business management must be improved in terms of ideology, work style, organization, and systems in order to ensure the victory of the production increase and savings movement. The Wuhan Municipal Committee requires all factories and mines to continue to implement the system of one leader responsible, adhere to various scientific organizational systems, and strengthen financial management to truly guide production and serve production.
    Third, strengthen technical management, and first strengthen the chief engineer system. Party administrative cadres should not simply assign tasks to the chief engineer, but should warmly unite with him and patiently help him to stimulate his enthusiasm and enable him to consciously assume important responsibilities. Existing technical personnel must be used reasonably, transformed, and improved; the training of new technical personnel and skilled workers (especially senior technicians) should be highly valued and carried out in an organized and planned manner. In order to strengthen technical management, it is also necessary to conscientiously implement technical organizational measures plans, strengthen the education of discipline in the implementation of technical regulations, and overcome the negative emotions of some cadres regarding strengthening technical management. In addition, the Wuhan Municipal Committee has made clear instructions on the organizational work of production, supply, and sales, safety and health work, and security work.

    中共武汉市委号召全市开展增产节约运动
    保证全面完成今年国家计划
    中国共产党武汉市委员会在九月二十七日作出决定，号召全市开展增产节约运动，保证全面完成今年的国家计划。
    今年夏季，武汉市人民战胜了自有水文记录以来空前严重的洪水威胁，确保了武汉地区国家建设和人民生命财产的安全。这一胜利是有重大意义的。但是，洪水给武汉市的各项工作带来了相当严重的困难。在基本建设方面，土木建筑工程尚有百分之五十以上的任务要在第四季度或推迟到明春完成。某些重点工程也要较原计划适当推迟才能完成。工业生产方面，第三季度在紧张的防汛斗争中，生产领导工作不免有所放松，产品质量不好，原材料消耗过大，产品规格和财务成本指标一般完成得很差。财经贸易工作方面，第四季度的任务也十分繁重。由于洪水在郊区和周围广大农村造成灾害，今后的供应和销售工作也还有不少困难。针对这种情况，武汉市委根据湖北省委的指示，决定在第四季度发动全市工人阶级，劳动人民和人民群众，开展增产节约运动，保证全面完成今年的国家计划，为迎接明年的国家计划创造良好条件；并以此支援灾区，支援农村，支援解放台湾。
    武汉市委指出，开展增产节约运动的总目标是保证全面完成国家计划，不是无限制地超出国家计划去增加产量产值，而是在国家计划的控制范围内，提高技术，保证质量，降低成本以增加收入。除了国家需要增产并有增产可能的单位，可经上级批准有计划的增产外，一般不要求增加产量。根据这个方针，武汉市委决定，在基本建设方面，必须再做一次工程排队，以便把力量集中到重点工程项目上。在工业生产方面，要求努力保证质量、降低成本，力争全面完成各项指标。在财经贸易方面，贸易工作应大力改善经营管理，减少商品流转费用，加速资金周转，增加合理利润，以保证国家收入计划的完成并切实为生产服务。银行工作应大力组织货币回笼，提倡储蓄，加强对企业的财务监督。财政工作方面应争取完成税收任务，紧缩不必要的开支。在郊区农业和手工业生产方面，要经过互助合作的道路，组织生产自救运动。武汉市委并号召全市广泛开展节约救灾运动，特别要做好募集寒衣和节约用电两项工作，以支援灾区农民和工业建设。
    为了保证增产节约运动顺利开展，武汉市委指示各级党组织努力做好以下各项工作：
    第一、加强政治思想工作。党的政治工作总的要求是保证国家计划的完成，并使群众的社会主义觉悟不断提高。因此，在增产节约运动中，必须首先发挥干部和群众的积极性和创造性，发挥过去几年工作和防汛斗争中的积极因素，使党和群众的队伍保持健康情绪和坚强的斗志。在增产节约运动中，还必须经常运用批评和自我批评的武器，防止和反对工业生产中的自满情绪和保守观念，反对基本建设中贪多图快的盲目冒进倾向。在增产节约运动中，必须在计划指导下，有领导地放手发动群众开展劳动竞赛。第二，提高业务管理水平。必须使业务管理从思想作风上、组织制度上提高，才能保证增产节约运动的胜利。武汉市委要求各厂矿继续推行一长负责制，坚持各种科学的组织制度，并加强财务管理，使之真正指导生产而又为生产服务。
    第三、加强技术管理，首先加强总工程师制度。党的行政干部对总工程师不应单纯交代任务，而要热情地团结他，耐心地帮助他，以启发他的积极性，使之自觉地担当起重大的责任。对现有的技术人员，必须合理使用，改造提高；对新的技术人员和技术工人（特别是高级技工）的培养应十分重视，要有组织有计划地进行这一工作。为了加强技术管理，还要认真贯彻技术组织措施计划，加强执行技术规定的纪律教育，克服某些干部对加强技术管理的消极情绪。此外，武汉市委对产、供、销的组织工作，安全卫生工作和保卫工作，都作了明确的指示。
