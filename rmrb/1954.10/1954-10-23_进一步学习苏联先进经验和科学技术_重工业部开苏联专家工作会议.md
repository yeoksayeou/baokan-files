Xinhua News Agency, 22nd:

    To better implement the suggestions of Soviet experts and to further systematically study advanced Soviet experience and science and technology, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the People's Republic of China convened a working conference of Soviet experts from October 6th to 9th. Attending the conference were more than 200 responsible cadres and related engineering and technical personnel from various professional administrative bureaus, factories, mines, and capital construction units.
    The conference, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, reviewed the situation of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system in learning advanced Soviet experience, science and technology, and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts in recent years. It focused on studying the issue of further systematically learning advanced experience and science and technology from Soviet experts during the period of large-scale national construction. The conference believes that the Ministry of Heavy Industry system has made great achievements in learning advanced Soviet experience and implementing expert suggestions in recent years. It has basically implemented the major suggestions of Soviet experts, learned and promoted many advanced Soviet experiences and science and technologies, thereby improving production, accelerating construction speed, and raising the technical and professional level of the broad masses of employees. However, due to insufficient understanding of the significant meaning of learning advanced Soviet experience and science and technology by many leading cadres, this work still lacks organization and planning, preventing the learning of advanced Soviet experience from forming a mass upsurge among the broad masses of employees. In implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, there are still serious shortcomings such as ineffective implementation, lack of comprehensiveness, procrastination, and perfunctoriness. If these shortcomings are not quickly overcome, the requirements of large-scale construction cannot be met, which will bring huge losses to production and construction. The conference pointed out that the Ministry of Heavy Industry system shoulders major construction and production tasks during the period of large-scale national construction. It must not only build many technically complex and large-scale enterprises, but also organize these enterprises to smoothly put into production. In terms of production, it is required to produce better and more products than in the past, especially to manufacture many new products that could not be manufactured in the past, to meet the needs of national construction and the people. However, the existing technical and professional level is not commensurate with these tasks. Therefore, in order to ensure the completion of the country's First Five-Year Plan and to prepare forces for the realization of the country's Second Five-Year Plan, it has become an urgent task to further systematically study advanced Soviet experience and science and technology, with the enthusiastic assistance of a large number of Soviet experts, to strive to cultivate our own experts in various industries as soon as possible.
    Based on the experience of recent years, the conference pointed out that conscientiously, with leadership, and planned learning from Soviet experts and implementing the various suggestions of Soviet experts is the main direction for systematically learning advanced Soviet experience and science and technology at present. Leading cadres at all levels must consolidate the idea of learning from Soviet experts and regard learning from Soviet experts and implementing their suggestions as a major leadership task. The conference strictly criticized the erroneous thoughts of some leading cadres, such as conservatism and complacency, and demanded that leading cadres at all levels must personally do this work well.
    The conference pointed out that to do a good job in learning from Soviet experts and implementing their suggestions, a series of organizational, technical, and political work must be carried out. To this end, the conference demanded that all bureaus, factories, mines, and capital construction units quickly conduct a comprehensive review of the work of learning from the Soviet Union and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, formulate plans for systematically learning advanced experience and science and technology in various industries from Soviet experts. The plan must have clear goals, steps, and learning methods. In order to ensure the effective implementation of Soviet expert suggestions and ensure the realization of learning plans, the conference required all units to quickly establish and improve leadership organizations responsible for implementing Soviet expert suggestions and learning from Soviet experts, responsible for regularly inspecting and supervising the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions and learning from Soviet experts, and to organize relevant departments to sort out the various suggestions of Soviet experts and the advanced Soviet experience introduced, and systematically promote them to various departments. In order to make the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions and learning from Soviet experts become the personal requirements of the broad masses of employees, the conference demanded that leading cadres at all levels must repeatedly and continuously explain to the masses of employees the importance of learning from Soviet experts and implementing their suggestions, and promptly criticize various erroneous thoughts, so as to guide the learning of advanced Soviet experience and science and technology to a high tide.

    进一步学习苏联先进经验和科学技术
    重工业部开苏联专家工作会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】为了更好地贯彻苏联专家建议，进一步系统地学习苏联先进经验和科学技术，中华人民共和国重工业部在十月六日到九日召开了苏联专家工作会议。参加会议的有各专业管理局、工厂、矿山和基本建设单位的负责干部和有关的工程技术人员等二百多人。
    会议以批评和自我批评的精神检查了重工业部系统几年来学习苏联先进经验、科学技术和贯彻苏联专家建议的情况，着重研究了在国家大规模建设时期进一步向苏联专家系统地学习先进经验和科学技术的问题。会议认为：重工业部系统几年来在学习苏联先进经验和贯彻专家建议方面，已取得很大成绩，基本上贯彻了苏联专家的各项重大建议，学习和推广了不少苏联先进经验和科学技术，因而改进了生产，加快了建设速度，提高了企业管理水平和广大职工的技术业务水平。但是，由于许多领导干部对于学习苏联先进经验和科学技术的重大意义认识不足，因而这一工作还缺乏组织性和计划性，使学习苏联先进经验还没有形成广大职工的群众性的高潮。在贯彻苏联专家建议方面，还有贯彻不力、不够全面、拖拉敷衍等严重缺点。如果不迅速克服这些缺点，就不能满足大规模建设的要求，就会给生产和建设带来巨大的损失。会议指出：重工业部系统在国家大规模建设时期担负着重大的建设任务和生产任务，不仅要建设许多技术复杂、规模庞大的企业，而且还要组织这些企业顺利地投入生产；在生产方面，要求比过去生产更好更多的产品，特别是要制造许多过去不会制造的新产品，满足国家建设和人民的需要。但是现有的技术业务水平和这些任务比较起来是不相称的。因此，为了保证完成国家第一个五年建设计划，并为实现国家第二个五年计划准备力量，在目前有大批苏联专家热诚帮助的情况下，进一步系统地学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术，以便争取尽快地培养出自己各行各业的专家，已成为一个刻不容缓的任务。
    会议根据几年来的经验指出：认真地有领导有计划地向苏联专家学习、贯彻苏联专家的各项建议，是目前系统地学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术的主要方向。各级领导干部必须巩固地树立向苏联专家学习的思想，把向苏联专家学习和贯彻苏联专家建议当作一项主要的领导任务。会议严格地批判了某些领导干部的保守、自满等错误思想，要求各级领导干部必须亲自动手做好这一工作。
    会议指出：要使向苏联专家学习和贯彻专家建议的工作做好，必须进行一系列的组织工作、技术工作和政治工作。为此，会议要求各局、工厂、矿山和基本建设单位迅速地对学习苏联和贯彻苏联专家建议的工作普遍进行一次检查，制订向苏联专家系统学习各行各业先进经验和科学技术的计划，计划中要有明确的目标、步骤和学习方法。为了保证切实地贯彻苏联专家建议和保证学习计划的实现，会议要求各单位迅速地建立和健全负责贯彻苏联专家建议和向苏联专家学习的领导机构，负责对贯彻苏联专家建议和向苏联专家学习的情况经常进行检查、督促，并要组织有关部门把苏联专家的各项建议和介绍的苏联先进经验加以整理，并有计划地推广到各部门。为了使贯彻苏联专家建议和向苏联专家学习成为广大职工的切身要求，会议要求各级领导干部必须反复不断地向职工群众讲解向苏联专家学习和贯彻苏联专家建议的重要性，及时地批判各种各样的错误思想，以便把学习苏联先进经验和科学技术引向高潮。
