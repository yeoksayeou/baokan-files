    Guangdong Coastal Fishermen Begin Autumn Fishing Work
    Hongze Lake Fish Production to Achieve Largest Harvest in Over a Decade

    The autumn fishing season has begun in the maritime fishing areas of Guangdong Province. In eastern Guangdong, where the fishing season starts earliest, fishermen set sail after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Many large fishing boats from central and western Guangdong have also come here to fish. From mid-September to the end of September, the coastal fishing grounds of eastern Guangdong have already harvested approximately 100,000 dan (a Chinese unit of weight) of yellow croaker, sardine, and pomfret. The fisheries production cooperatives, organized before the autumn fishing season, have fully demonstrated their superiority during the season. For example, a pair of trawlers from the Shantou Port No. 2 Fisheries Production Cooperative caught 382 dan of large sardines in four and a half hauls during the initial autumn fishing, averaging 85 dan per haul, a 15% increase compared to the highest-yielding individual households in the area. As the fishing season moves from east to west, fishermen along the coasts of central and western Guangdong are also gradually going out to sea for production.

    This autumn, Hongze Lake fish production will achieve its largest harvest in over a decade. As the lake water gradually recedes, dense layers of fish have been widely discovered in the lake, which spans millions of mu (a Chinese unit of area). In some areas, the fish layer is as thick as two chi (a Chinese unit of length). Such a large quantity of fish has not been seen in the past dozen years. Currently, over 20,000 fishermen around the lake are repairing or adding boats and fishing gear, preparing for large-scale fishing when the lake water becomes shallower. Members of the Sun Jingkui Fisheries Production Cooperative are actively weaving bamboo weirs and have set a target of catching 100,000 jin (a Chinese unit of weight) of fish this autumn, a 30,000 jin increase compared to the spring season. It is estimated that the total autumn fish production from the entire lake will reach over one million jin.

    Entrusted by the state, the Hongze District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Sihong County has formulated a procurement plan that is many times larger than in the past. They are currently adding staff and preparing to establish three more procurement stations. Hundreds of thousands of jin of salt, stored in the county cooperative, are being successively transported to Hongze Lake to meet the needs of fish processing in a timely manner.

    广东省沿海渔民开始秋季捕鱼工作
    洪泽湖鱼产将获得十几年来最大的丰收
    广东省海洋渔区秋汛旺季已经开始。渔汛季节最早的粤东，渔民在中秋节后即已扬帆出海。粤中、粤西的许多大型渔船也都赶来这里捕鱼。从九月中旬到九月底止，粤东沿海各渔场已捕获黄花、丁鱼、立鱼等十万担左右。在秋汛前组织起来的渔业生产合作社，汛期中充分显示了优越性。如汕尾港拖船第二渔业生产合作社的一对拖船，在秋风头生产中，出海四流半网，捕到三百八十二担大丁鱼，平均一流网捕鱼八十五担，比当地最高产量的单干户增产百分之十五。现在随着渔汛的由东往西移动，粤中、粤西沿海的渔民也陆续出海生产。

    今年秋季，洪泽湖鱼产将获得十几年来最大的一次丰收。现在湖水正逐渐下落，在数百万亩面积的湖里，普遍发现厚密的鱼层，最多的地方鱼层有两市尺厚。这样多的鱼，是过去十几年所没有过的。目前全湖两万多渔民，正在修理或添制船只和捕鱼工具，准备在湖水再浅一些的时候，大规模地捕捉。孙景奎渔业生产合作社的社员，正在积极编制竹簖，订出秋季捕鱼十万斤的指标，比春季增产三万斤。估计全湖秋季出鱼将达一千数百万斤。
    泗洪县洪泽区供销合作社接受国家的委托，已经订出比过去收购量大许多倍的收购计划。现在正在添调干部，并准备多设三个收购站。存放在县合作社的数十万斤食盐，正在陆续向洪泽湖调运，以便及时供应鱼产加工的需要。
