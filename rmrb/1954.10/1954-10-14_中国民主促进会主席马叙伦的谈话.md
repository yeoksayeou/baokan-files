During the visit of the Soviet government delegation to our country, it held talks with our government and issued a communique and relevant documents on the Sino-Soviet talks on October 12. This is an encouraging and extremely significant event. The facts experienced since the founding of the People's Republic of China five years ago increasingly prove that the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people is a reliable guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world. The sincere and selfless assistance provided by the Soviet government and people to our country has played a huge role in accelerating our socialist construction. This time, the Sino-Soviet talks further demonstrated the consolidation and expansion of the fraternal friendship between the two countries. The facts of the Sino-Soviet talks fully prove that the two countries have completely consistent views on the ever-developing comprehensive cooperation and on various issues of the international situation. Any evil activities to provoke Sino-Soviet relations are futile. As pointed out in the Sino-Soviet Joint Declaration: "The cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union has great vitality." This friendship "with great vitality" is unbreakable and invincible by any force. The friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly play a greater role in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world and accelerating our socialist construction in the future. All members of our China Association for Promoting Democracy, together with the people of the whole country, wholeheartedly support and endorse the joint declaration and the agreements reached in the communique between the two governments, and express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and people for their continuous selfless assistance and sincere cooperation to our country. We cherish Sino-Soviet friendship as we cherish the apple of our eye. We are determined to learn humbly from our great ally, strengthen the friendly unity with the Soviet people, and work together with the Soviet people to safeguard the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦的谈话
    苏联政府代表团在访问我国期间，和我国政府举行了会谈，在十月十二日发表了关于中苏举行会谈的公报和有关文件，这是令人鼓舞的具有极重大意义的大事。中华人民共和国建国五年以来所经历过的事实愈益清楚地证明：中苏两国人民的友好合作是远东及世界和平的可靠保证。苏联政府和人民给予我国的真诚无私的援助对于加速我国社会主义建设起了极大的作用。中苏两国政府这一次会谈更加表明了两国间兄弟友谊的巩固和扩大。中苏会谈的事实，充分证明了中苏两国在日益发展的全面合作和对于国际形势的各项问题上的观点是完全一致的。任何人挑拨中苏关系的罪恶活动，都是徒劳无益的。正如中苏两国联合宣言中所指出：“中华人民共和国和苏联的合作是具有伟大生命力的”。这种“具有伟大生命力”的友谊是牢不可破的，是任何力量所不能战胜的。中苏两国之间的友好合作在今后保卫远东与世界和平及加速我国社会主义建设事业中无疑地将发挥更大的作用。我们中国民主促进会全体成员和全国人民一道，衷心拥护和支持两国政府的联合宣言和公报中达成的各项协议，并对苏联政府和人民不断给予我国的无私援助和竭诚合作表示衷心的感谢。我们像爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护中苏友谊，我们决心向伟大的盟邦虚心学习，加强和苏联人民的友好团结，并与苏联人民共同为维护远东和世界和平事业而努力。
