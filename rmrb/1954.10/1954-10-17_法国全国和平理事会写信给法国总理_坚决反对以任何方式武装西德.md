    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 15th: According to TASS, the Standing Committee of the French National Peace Council sent an open letter to French Prime Minister Mendès France, condemning Mendès France's attitude at the London conference, which decided to arm West Germany.
    The letter said to Mendès France: Public opinion is devoted to peace and has long believed that the war in Indochina must be stopped, so it supported your actions at the Geneva Conference. Public opinion greeted the National Assembly's rejection of the European Defense Community Treaty with great joy. However, the position you took at the London Conference has deeply disappointed public opinion.
    The letter pointed out: In the European Defense Community Treaty, what most French people condemned first and foremost was the arming of Germany. But West Germany obtained this armament in the London Accords. The London Accords would bring the same consequences as the European Defense Community: arming Germany, deepening the division of Germany and the division of Europe, intensifying the arms race and the resulting fatal economic consequences for the living standards of the French people, and increasing the danger of war.
    The French Peace Council then pointed out that the inevitable argument for arming Germany could not convince public opinion, and emphasized: The prospect of negotiating on universal disarmament and a peaceful settlement of the German question has emerged and is becoming increasingly clear.
    The letter pointed out that Mendès France's approach of trying to implement the London Accords on the one hand while negotiating with the East on the other is unworkable. It said: It is impossible to achieve universal disarmament by arming West Germany. Public opinion knows that once the London Accords are approved, France, which has become an ally of West Germany, will be obliged to support Germany's plans in Europe, and France's freedom of action will be restricted. Public opinion has the right to demand that the government take the necessary actions before the debate on the ratification of the London Accords begins to seek an agreement on the German question and a disarmament agreement among the four major powers. On these two most important issues, France's interests are in line with the interests of peace.
      The letter concludes to Mendès France: Public opinion will prevent the arming of Germany. It will tell you that giving weapons to German militarists is arrogant. It will appeal to its representatives and its members of parliament. It will express its will more and more firmly. It yearns for the security of France, the independence of France, the security of European countries, worldwide disarmament and peace. This deep desire will be expressed especially on the National Day for Peace - October 31. Since its establishment, the National Peace Council has resolutely opposed the arming of West Germany in any way and advocated a negotiated solution to the German question. It believes that public opinion will listen to and understand its call.

    法国全国和平理事会写信给法国总理
    坚决反对以任何方式武装西德
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：法国全国和平理事会常务委员会给法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯一封公开信，谴责孟戴斯—弗朗斯在决定武装西德的伦敦会议上的态度。
    信中对孟戴斯—弗朗斯说：舆论致力于和平，而且长久以来一直认为必须停止印度支那战争，所以支持了你在日内瓦会议上的行动。舆论非常高兴地迎接了国民议会拒绝欧洲防务集团条约的决定。但是，你在伦敦会议上所采取的立场却使舆论界深感失望。
    信中指出：在欧洲防务集团条约中，大多数法国人首先谴责的是武装德国。而西德却在伦敦协定中得到了这种武装。伦敦协定会带来和欧洲防务集团同样的后果：武装德国，加深德国的分裂和欧洲的分裂，加紧扩充军备及由此而产生的对法国人民生活水平的致命的经济后果，加深战争的危险。
    法国和平理事会接着指出武装德国不可避免的说法不能使舆论信服，并且强调：有助于就普遍裁减军备及和平解决德国问题进行谈判的前景已经出现，而且日益明朗。
    信中指出孟戴斯—弗朗斯所谓一方面要争取实行伦敦协定而另一方面又要和东方进行谈判的作法是行不通的。它说：通过武装西德的方式来达到普遍裁减军备是不可能的。舆论知道，伦敦协定批准之后，变成西德盟友的法国就有义务支持德国在欧洲的计划，法国的行动自由就要受到限制。舆论有权要求政府在关于批准伦敦协定的辩论开始之前，采取必要的行动，争取四大国签订关于德国问题的协定和裁军的协定。在这两个最主要的问题上，法国的利益是与和平的利益相吻合的。
      这封信最后对孟戴斯—弗朗斯说：舆论将阻止武装德国。它将告诉你，把武器给德国军国主义者是狂妄的。它要向它的代表和它的议员呼吁。它将越来越坚决地表示自己的意志。它渴望法国的安全、法国的独立、欧洲各国的安全、全世界的裁减军备与和平。这种深切的愿望特别会在全国争取和平日——十月三十一日——表达出来。全国和平理事会从成立以来就一直坚决反对以任何方式武装西德，主张以协商方式解决德国问题。它相信，舆论会倾听和理解它的号召。
