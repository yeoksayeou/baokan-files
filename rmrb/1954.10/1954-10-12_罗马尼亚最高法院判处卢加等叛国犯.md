(Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, October 11th) According to TASS, Bucharest, October 10th: The Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Romanian People's Republic tried the cases of traitors V. Luga, A. Iacob, I. Solymoss and D. Cernica from October 4th to 8th.

According to many documents, the defendants' confessions, and the testimony of many witnesses, the court determined that the defendant Luga had organized a counter-revolutionary treasonous group and actively engaged in activities to undermine the people's democratic regime and disintegrate the national economy in order to sabotage Romania's socialist construction. It has now been determined that Luga's counter-revolutionary activities began as early as 1918-1919, when he volunteered to join the army to suppress the Hungarian proletarian revolution. As a machine gun squad leader, Luga directly participated in the bloody suppression in Transylvania and Hungary, killing workers and peasants who fought to overthrow bourgeois-landlord oppression. In 1924, Luga wormed his way into the Romanian Communist Party organization in Brasov and immediately established contact with the local security organs (secret service), reporting on the Party's underground work and betraying many revolutionary comrades. From that year on, Luga became an agent of the security organs. In 1928, he reported to the security organs that the Romanian Communist Party was about to hold its Fourth National Congress, and at the congress, he worked for the security organs, handing over the congress resolutions, other documents, and the entire list of the Party Central Committee to the security organs. In 1929, Luga helped the security organs persecute participants in the Unified Trade Union Congress held in Timisoara, arresting trade union leaders. From 1929-1930, Luga received material assistance from the security organs to subsidize the traitor group of Macel Pauker (Luximin), a veteran enemy of the communist movement and a Trotskyist. After August 23, 1944, Luga meticulously concealed his past hostile activities and seized high positions in the Party and the state. For his treasonous purposes, Luga gathered counter-revolutionaries around him and used his position as Minister of Finance and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers to place these counter-revolutionaries in important state organs. Among them were A. Iacob, a veteran enemy of the working class and a black marketeer with close ties to the big bourgeoisie, war criminal I. Solymoss, and Trotskyist D. Cernica.

Luga and his accomplices engaged in criminal activities that undermined the national economy. In the area of socialist industry, they disrupted the production activities of various enterprises, which caused serious difficulties in the implementation of the national plans for 1950 and 1951, bringing great losses to the state and the working people. The criminals also attempted to undermine the worker-peasant alliance. Luga and Iacob issued instructions to the state tax authorities aimed at maintaining capitalists. Cernica and Solymoss carried out Luga's instructions, using their positions as Vice-Chairmen of the Central Council of Cooperatives to allow alien and hostile elements to enter the cooperative organizations. At the end of 1951, the defendants also attempted to sabotage the currency reform.

During the trial, the crimes of all the defendants were fully proven based on documents, material evidence, the defendants' confessions, and the testimony of many witnesses. The defendants all fully admitted the above-mentioned crimes they had committed against the state and the working people.

The Supreme Court of the Romanian People's Republic sentenced V. Luga to death, A. Iacob to twenty years of hard labor, I. Solymoss to fifteen years of hard labor, and D. Cernica to three years of imprisonment.

The Presidium of the National Assembly reviewed the request of the criminal Vasili Luga and commuted Luga's death sentence to life imprisonment with hard labor.

    罗马尼亚最高法院判处卢加等叛国犯
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特十日讯：罗马尼亚人民共和国最高法院军事法庭，在十月四日至八日审理了瓦·卢加、亚·雅各布、伊·邵利莫什和杜·切尔尼奇卡等叛国犯的案件。
    根据许多文件、被告的供词和许多见证人的证词，法院确定，被告卢加曾组织反革命的叛国集团，积极进行破坏人民民主政权和瓦解国民经济的活动，以破坏罗马尼亚的社会主义建设。现已确定，卢加的反革命活动早在一九一八—一九一九年就已开始，那时他曾志愿参加军队去镇压匈牙利无产阶级革命。卢加作为一个机枪组的组长，在德兰斯瓦尼亚和匈牙利直接参加了血腥镇压，杀害为推翻资产阶级—地主压迫而斗争的工人和农民。一九二四年，卢加在布拉索夫钻进了罗马尼亚共产党组织，立即就和地方的保安机关（暗探局）建立了联系，向它报告党的地下工作情况，出卖了许多革命志士。从那年起，卢加就成为保安机关的奸细。一九二八年，他向保安机关报告罗马尼亚共产党即将举行第四次代表大会，在代表大会上又替保安机关做工作，把代表大会的决议、其他文件以及党中央委员会的全部名单交给了保安机关。一九二九年，卢加帮助保安机关迫害在底密索拉举行的统一工会代表大会的参加者，逮捕工会领袖。一九二九—一九三○年，卢加从保安机关得到物质补助，用来资助共产主义运动的老牌敌人、托洛茨基分子马切尔·波克（卢克西明）叛徒集团。一九四四年八月二十三日以后，卢加周密地隐瞒了他过去的敌对活动，窃据了党和国家的高级职位。卢加为了他的叛国目的，把反革命分子搜罗在自己的周围，并利用他的财政部部长和部长会议副主席的地位，把这些反革命分子安插在重要的国家机关中。其中有工人阶级的老牌敌人、和大资产阶级有着紧密联系的黑市商人亚·雅各布，战犯伊·邵利莫什和托洛茨基分子杜·切尔尼奇卡。
    卢加和他的同谋者从事于破坏国民经济的罪恶活动。在社会主义工业方面，他们破坏各企业的生产活动，因而使得一九五零年和一九五一年国家计划的执行遭遇到严重的困难，给国家和劳动人民带来莫大的损失。罪犯并企图破坏工农联盟。卢加和雅各布曾向国家税收机关发出目的在于维护资本主义分子的指示。切尔尼奇卡和邵利莫什执行卢加的指令，利用其合作社中央理事会副主席的地位，容许异己和敌对分子进入合作社组织。一九五一年年底，被告并企图破坏币制改革。
    在审讯过程中，根据文件、物证、被告的供词和许多证人的证词，充分证明了所有被告的罪行。被告们都完全承认他们对国家和劳动人民所犯的上述罪行。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国最高法院判处瓦·卢加死刑，判处亚·雅各布二十年劳役，伊·邵利莫什十五年劳役，杜·切尔尼奇卡三年徒刑。
    国民议会主席团审查了罪犯瓦西里·卢加的请求，把卢加的死刑改为终生劳役。
