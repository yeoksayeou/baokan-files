Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw dispatch via Polish Press Agency:

    "People's Tribune" recently published an article entitled "Major Factors in the Development of Polish Industry," discussing the great role of Soviet assistance in the development of Polish industry.

    The article points out that before the war, Poland was economically far behind the industrially developed countries of Europe. But now, Poland has become one of the advanced countries in Europe economically, and is about to catch up with countries like France. At present, Poland has surpassed Italy in terms of the absolute volume of industrial production, while before the war, Poland's industrial output was only 40% of Italy's. It is particularly noteworthy that the production of those industrial sectors in Poland that are of great significance to the national economy has greatly exceeded that of Italy. For example, in 1938, Poland's machinery manufacturing and chemical industries produced about half as much as Italy. Now Poland produces more than twice as much machinery and one-third more chemicals than Italy.

    The article emphasizes that the rapid development of Polish industry is due to the establishment of mutually beneficial and cooperative economic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union continuously provides Poland with industrial equipment, machinery, raw materials, and blueprints on extremely favorable terms and at fair and reasonable prices, and constantly provides Poland with highly skilled technical assistance.

    The article then writes that the American propaganda machine is trying hard to prove that the people's democracies are as if being "exploited" by the Soviet Union; while backward countries within the sphere of influence of the world capitalist market have good conditions for development due to cooperation with the United States. But the facts are just the opposite. In the past decade, under the shackles of "American aid," not a single backward capitalist country has made any progress in industrialization. However, with the help of the Soviet Union, the situation in Poland and other people's democracies, which were once economically backward, has fundamentally changed. For example, the industrial output of Greece and Turkey accounted for 1.1% of the total European industrial output in 1938, and did not exceed 1.3% in 1952. In 1938, Poland's industrial output accounted for 2.5% of the total European industrial output, but by 1953 it had more than doubled, reaching 6.2%. The total steel production of Latin American countries, with a total population of about 150 million, which has been the main object of American "concern" and "aid" for decades, was less than two million tons in 1953. And the steel plant built by the Soviet Union to help Poland—the Lenin Metallurgical Combine—will have a steel output of almost that amount when it is completed in the future.

### 波兰工业在苏联大力援助下迅速发展

    波兰工业在苏联大力援助下迅速发展
      【新华社二十日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：
  “人民论坛报”最近发表了一篇题为“波兰工业发展的重大因素”的文章，论苏联的援助对波兰工业发展的巨大作用。
    文章指出，在战前，波兰在经济上远远落后于欧洲工业发达的国家。但现在，波兰在经济上已成为欧洲先进国家之一，而且快要赶上像法国这样的国家了。目前，波兰在工业生产的绝对量上已超过了意大利，而在战前波兰的工业产量只等于意大利工业产量的百分之四十。特别值得注意的是，波兰那些对全国经济具有重大意义的工业部门的生产，已经大大超过了意大利。例如，一九三八年波兰机器制造业和化学工业的生产额比意大利约少二分之一。现在波兰所生产的机器和化学品分别比意大利多一倍多和三分之一。
    文章着重指出，波兰工业所以得到这样迅速的发展，是由于波兰和苏联建立了互助合作的经济关系。苏联按极优惠的条件和公平合理的价格，源源不断地供给波兰以工业设备、机器和原料以及设计书，并不断给波兰以高度精湛的技术帮助。
    文章接着写道，美国宣传机关竭力想证明，人民民主国家仿佛是受苏联的“剥削”；而处于世界资本主义市场势力范围内的落后国家则由于和美国合作而具有良好的发展条件。但事实恰恰相反。最近十年来，在“美援”的枷锁下，没有一个落后的资本主义国家在工业化方面有任何进展。但在苏联的帮助下，曾经在经济上落后的波兰和其他人民民主国家的情况已根本地改变了。例如，希腊和土耳其的工业产量在一九三八年占欧洲工业总产量的百分之一点一，而在一九五二年也不超过百分之一点三。一九三八年波兰的工业产量在欧洲工业总产量中占百分之二点五，但到一九五三年就增加了一倍多，而达到百分之六点二。数十年来作为美国主要“关心”和“援助”对象的总人口约为一亿五千万的拉丁美洲各国，一九五三年的产钢量还不到两百万吨。而苏联帮助波兰建设的一个钢铁厂——列宁冶金联合企业，在将来建成后，它的钢产量就差不多达到这个数目。
