    Capital students are very concerned about the construction of the Asian Students Sanatorium and are actively supporting this project. Students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts are preparing to paint oil paintings and sculpt decorations for the sanatorium. The Radiological Machinery Repair Training Class of the Ministry of Public Health of the People's Republic of China sent advanced students to help the sanatorium install the X-ray machine. Students from the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University participated in the design work and sent fourth-year students from the Department of Architecture to the construction site to participate in ditch leveling work. Beijing Medical College also sent several top students to participate in medical work here.

    On the 24th, more than 300 students from six universities, including Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Institute of Geology, came to the construction site of the Asian Students Sanatorium on their holiday to perform voluntary labor. The students were excited to work for the unity and friendship of Asian youth and students. They worked hard and happily to clean up the site for the sanatorium. Jian Renchu, a student from the Beijing Institute of Geology, pushed earth like a construction worker, pushing more than 30 carts of soil and stones in less than two hours. The students of Peking University adopted an assembly line method for cleaning, and soon the scrap wood and small stones on the site were cleaned up.

    首都学生积极支援亚洲学生疗养院的建设
    首都学生都很关心亚洲学生疗养院的建设，积极支援这个工程。中央美术学院的学生正准备为疗养院绘制油画和雕刻装饰品。中华人民共和国卫生部放射线机械检修训练班派进修生帮助疗养院安装好了爱克斯光机。清华大学建筑系学生曾参加设计工作，并派建筑系四年级学生到工地参加平沟劳动。北京医学院也派了几名优等生到这里参加医务工作。
    二十四日，中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、北京农业大学、北京师范大学和北京地质学院等六个高等学校三百多个学生，利用假日来到亚洲学生疗养院的工地进行义务劳动。学生们为亚洲青年与学生的团结和友谊而劳动，都感到兴奋。他们紧张而愉快地为疗养院清理现场。北京地质学院学生简人初像一个建筑工人一样地推土，不到两小时就推了三十多车土和石头。北京大学的学生们采用流水作业的方法进行清理工作，不一会儿，现场的碎木和小石头就清理好了。
