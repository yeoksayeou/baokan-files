Anshan Iron and Steel Works: Preparations for Winter Construction Projects Mostly Ready
No. 6 Blast Furnace Completes October Production Plan Ahead of Schedule

[Our Newspaper] The preparations for key construction projects for the winter season at Anshan Iron and Steel Works are now largely complete.

Beginning in July, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, together with various construction companies, repeatedly studied the balance of design, equipment, and technical resources. They determined that 28 key projects, including the refractory materials plant, would be constructed this winter. They also began compiling construction organization designs and winter construction budgets. Currently, the construction organization designs for most of the key projects, such as the refractory materials plant, have been completed. Insulation and heating equipment for winter construction, such as transformers and boilers, are being prepared. At the construction sites, many units have built substations and boiler rooms and are busily installing boilers and other equipment. Various construction sites are also repairing transportation roads or building dedicated lines and formulating transportation management measures to minimize the transportation time when transporting heated concrete in winter. According to the experience of Soviet winter construction and Anshan Iron and Steel's past winter construction, this is an important key to ensuring project quality. In addition, various safety measures such as cold prevention, fire prevention, electricity prevention, and poison prevention, as well as labor protection products, are also being actively prepared. In terms of technical resources, Anshan Iron and Steel Company transferred construction technicians from various construction companies to training classes, and the first batch of technicians has completed training. Various construction companies are also training workers participating in winter construction and are beginning to formulate winter operating procedures.

In order to ensure that the preparations for winter construction can be completed in a timely manner, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, after the National Winter Construction Conference, organized special personnel to report and inspect the preparation work twice with the help of Soviet experts. The inspection promptly discovered that some construction site construction organization design forces were weak, the work progress was slow, and the project was particularly important. At this time, technical cadres were sent to help with the work. The inspection also found that the ordering of more than 100 special transformers required for the electrical heating method was relatively late. To ensure timely supply for construction needs and to cope with sudden climate changes, the company organized special personnel to investigate transformers that could be used as substitutes throughout the company, so that the existing transformers could basically guarantee electricity for construction.

[Our Newspaper, Anshan, 29th] China's third automated blast furnace – Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 6 Blast Furnace has completed the October national production plan ahead of schedule. Since No. 6 Blast Furnace was put into production on October 1, all the furnace workers, under the guidance of Soviet experts, have conscientiously promoted Soviet advanced experience such as "fast material flow" and "full air volume," and the production situation has been very good. In addition to continuously creating three new daily output records, they also completed the October national production plan ahead of schedule at 12:30 am on the 27th, and the quality of the iron all met the planned standards.

    鞍钢冬季施工工程的准备工作大部就绪
    第六号炼铁炉提前完成十月份生产计划
    【本报讯】鞍钢今年冬季施工的重点工程准备工作，目前已大部就绪。
    从七月起，鞍山钢铁公司会同各工程公司反复研究了设计、设备、技术力量的平衡，确定了耐火材料厂等二十八项关键性的重点工程在今年冬季施工，并着手编制施工组织设计和冬季施工预算。目前，耐火材料厂等重点工程的施工组织设计大部分已编制完。冬季施工用的变压器、锅炉等保温和加热设备，即将准备齐全。在施工的工地上，许多单位已把变电所、锅炉房修建起来，正在紧张地安装锅炉等设备。各工地还在整修运输道路或修筑专用线，拟订运输管理措施，以便在冬天运输加热后的混凝土时，能够把运输时间缩到最低限度。根据苏联冬季施工和鞍钢过去冬季施工的经验，这是保证工程质量的重要关键之一。此外，防寒、防火、防电、防毒等各种安全措施和劳动保护品也在积极准备中。在技术力量方面，鞍山钢铁公司从各工程公司抽调了施工技术人员到训练班去学习，第一批技术人员已训练完毕。各工程公司也正在训练参加冬季施工的工人，并开始制订冬季操作规程。
    为了使冬季施工的准备工作能够及时完成，鞍山钢铁公司在全国冬季施工会议以后，就组织专人在苏联专家帮助下进行了两次有关准备工作的汇报和检查。检查中及时发现了有些工地施工组织设计力量薄弱，工作进展迟缓而工程又特别重要，这时就派出技术干部去帮助工作。检查中还发现电气加热法需要的一百多台特种变压器订货比较晚，为了保证按时供应施工需要和应付气候突变，公司方面就组织专人在全公司中调查可以代用的变压器，使得已有的变压器基本上可以保证施工用电。
    【本报鞍山二十九日电】我国第三座自动化炼铁炉——鞍钢第六号炼铁炉已提前完成了十月份国家生产计划。六号炼铁炉从十月一日投入生产以来，全炉职工在苏联专家指导下，认真地推广了“快料顺行”、“全风量”等苏联先进经验，生产情况一直很好。他们除连续创造三次日产量新纪录外，并在二十七日夜间十二时半提前完成了十月份国家生产计划，铁的质量全部达到计划标准。
