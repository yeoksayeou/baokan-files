Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 23rd: A celebration was held on the 21st to pay tribute to the famous French scientists and great progressive social activists, the Joliot-Curies, to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of their discovery of artificial radioactivity. The celebration was attended by renowned French scientists, students of the Joliot-Curies, Minister of National Education Béguin, and many representatives from all walks of life in France.

Those who congratulated the Joliot-Curies included Louis de Broglie, Permanent Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, Gaston Dupouy, Director of the French National Center for Scientific Research, Francis Perrin, High Commissioner of the French Atomic Energy Commission, and Minister of National Education Béguin. They all pointed out that the scientific discoveries of the Joliot-Curies made significant contributions to the development of radioactive materials science worldwide.

Frédéric Joliot-Curie, on behalf of his wife and himself, expressed his gratitude for the honors given to them and called on scientists from all countries to strengthen ties. He said that now, when scientific inventions are often used for destructive purposes, when trust in science, that is, in the progress of civilization, may be undermined, we must oppose the use of science for malicious purposes.
