    Liaoning Province's Industrial and Mining Cities Actively Carry Out Factory and Mine Hygiene Work
    Industrial and mining cities in Liaoning Province, such as Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi, have actively carried out factory and mine hygiene work, achieving significant results.

    In Shenyang City, factories have done a lot of work in reducing high temperatures, preventing dust, and preventing occupational and common diseases. Shenyang Wire Rod Factory conducted a survey and analysis of high-temperature operations, reasonably improved workers' drinking water and established appropriate rest areas, and installed cooling devices in high-temperature operation areas. In the Shenyang Smelter's converter workshop, workers used to operate in an environment with radiant heat ranging from 54 to 92 degrees Celsius for a long time. Now, "organized natural ventilation" has been improved, and air showers and mobile air supply have been set up in the work area, reducing the temperature to 34 to 66 degrees Celsius. A shift system has also been established, limiting furnace operations to no more than ten minutes, and workers are provided with cool drinks and high-protein health foods. Anshan City has carried out the rectification of grassroots health organizations, established a workshop doctor responsibility system in the Steelmaking Plant Health Center, and carried out various disease prevention measures deep into the workshops; in all construction sites in the city, early and regular health supervision has been carried out. Benxi Iron and Steel Company uses enclosed and wet operations to produce refractory materials to avoid dust. Benxi Mining Bureau has set up first-aid stations and mobile warm water vehicles underground.

    Due to the active implementation of hygiene work and the improvement of working conditions, the industrial and mining cities have played a significant role in ensuring the health of employees and improving production efficiency. In Anshan City's factories and mines, there were no cases of typhus and smallpox this year, and diphtheria decreased by 94.3% compared to last year. In the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant, the improvement of hygiene work and the strengthening of disease prevention have greatly reduced common diseases, with colds decreasing by 20%, injuries decreasing by 26%, and other diseases decreasing to varying degrees.

    辽宁省工矿城市积极开展厂矿卫生工作
    辽宁省沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪等工矿城市，积极开展厂、矿卫生工作，获得了显著效果。
    沈阳市各工厂，在降低高温，防止粉尘及预防职业病和多发病方面，做了很多工作。沈阳线材厂，进行了高温作业的调查分析，合理地改善工人的饮水和设立了适当的休息场所，并在温度较高的作业场所，安设降温装置。沈阳冶炼厂真吹工段，工人长时期在辐射热五十四度到九十二度的环境里操作，现在改进了“有组织的自然通风”，在工作地带，设立了空气淋浴和移动式送风，使温度降低到三十四度到六十六度。还建立了炉前操作不超过十分钟的换班制度，以及供给工人清凉饮料和高蛋白保健食品等。鞍山市进行了基层卫生组织的整顿工作，在炼钢厂保健所中建立了车间医师责任制，深入车间进行各项疾病预防措施；在全市施工现场，进行早期和经常性的卫生监督工作。本溪钢铁公司生产耐火材料，为了避免粉尘，采用了密闭式和湿式作业。本溪矿务局在井下设立了急救站和巡回温水车。
    各工矿城市，由于积极开展卫生工作，改善劳动条件，对确保职工身体健康和提高生产效率起了很大作用。鞍山市各厂矿，今年没有发生斑疹伤寒和天花，白喉比去年减少了百分之九十四点三。鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂，因为改进了卫生工作，加强了疾病预防，使多发病大大减少，感冒降低了百分之二十，外伤降低了百分之二十六，其他疾病也有不同程度的减少。
