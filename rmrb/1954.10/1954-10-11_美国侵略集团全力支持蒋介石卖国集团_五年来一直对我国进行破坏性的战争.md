(Xinhua News Agency, October 10th) Under the instigation and with the assistance of the American aggressive clique, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has been continuously using Taiwan as a base for the past five years to frantically carry out harassing and destructive wars against the coastal areas of mainland China, attacking our coastal islands, bombing our coastal cities, and looting our ships and fishermen. During this period, in order to support the war activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the American aggressive clique has directly dispatched a large number of military aircraft to intrude into our country's airspace to conduct reconnaissance activities and even bomb and strafe peaceful Chinese people, constituting a serious act of aggression that infringes upon our country's territorial sovereignty.

According to incomplete statistics, from 1950 to August 1954, under the support of the American aggressive clique, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique launched 41 attacks and harassments against our coastal islands and mainland, using a total of more than 28,000 Chiang bandit troops. However, they were all met with head-on blows from the People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces, and most of the Chiang bandit troops were annihilated. For example, on September 20, 1952, about 200 Chiang bandit troops from the "South China Sea Guerrilla Column" and other units attacked and occupied Nanpeng Island off the coast of Guangdong. On October 19 of the same year, the People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces completely annihilated this group of Chiang bandit troops and recovered Nanpeng Island. On July 16, 1953, more than 10,000 Chiang bandit troops, under the cover of airplanes, warships, and tanks, invaded Dongshan Island off the coast of Fujian. The People's Liberation Army coastal defense forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack, annihilating 3,379 Chiang bandit troops, sinking three of their landing crafts, shooting down two airplanes, and seizing 46 various cannons, 109 light and heavy machine guns, as well as a large number of ammunition and military supplies, giving the Chiang bandit troops a severe blow.

From July 1950 to September 1954, according to incomplete statistics, the airplanes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, supplied by the United States, intruded into our mainland and coastal areas a total of 977 batches, totaling 1,427 sorties. Among them, 73 batches carried out bombing, dropping 591 bombs; 38 batches carried out strafing.

During the same period, the American aggressive clique continuously intruded into our country's airspace with airplanes to conduct direct armed provocations. According to incomplete statistics, American airplanes intruded into our country's airspace a total of 8,220 batches, totaling 32,995 sorties. Among them, 199 batches carried out bombing, totaling 1,339 sorties, dropping a total of 2,408 bombs; 116 batches carried out strafing, totaling 526 sorties.

In the past five years, Chiang bandit navy attacked and looted more than 470 of our various ships, and kidnapped and murdered more than 1,300 of our fishermen.

All these facts show that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a tool used by the American aggressive clique to threaten China's security and Asian peace. In order to defend its territorial integrity, its own security, and international peace, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    美国侵略集团全力支持蒋介石卖国集团
    五年来一直对我国进行破坏性的战争
    【新华社十日讯】蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略集团的指使和援助之下，五年来不断以台湾为基地，疯狂地对中国大陆沿海地区进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，袭击我沿海岛屿，轰炸我沿海城市，劫掠我船只和渔民。在这期间，为了支持蒋介石卖国集团的战争活动，美国侵略集团更直接派遣大批军用飞机侵入我国领空，进行侦察活动以至轰炸扫射和平的中国人民，构成了侵犯我国领土主权的严重侵略行为。
    据不完全统计，从一九五○年到一九五四年八月，蒋介石卖国集团在美国侵略集团支持之下，对我国沿海岛屿和大陆进行了四十一次袭击和骚扰，使用蒋贼军共达二万八千余名，但是都遭到人民解放军海防部队的迎头痛击，蒋贼军大部被歼灭。其中如一九五二年九月二十日，蒋贼军“南海游击纵队”等部约二百人袭占我广东沿海的南澎岛。同年十月十九日，人民解放军海防部队即全部歼灭了这一股蒋贼军，收复南澎岛。一九五三年七月十六日，蒋贼军一万余名在飞机、兵舰、坦克掩护下窜犯福建沿海的东山岛，人民解放军海防部队当即予以痛击，歼灭蒋贼军三千三百七十九名，击沉其登陆艇三艘，击落飞机二架，缴获各种炮四十六门、轻重机枪一百零九挺以及大批弹药和军用品，给予蒋贼军以严重打击。
    从一九五○年七月到一九五四年九月，据不完全统计，蒋介石卖国集团的由美国供给的飞机侵入我国大陆和沿海共计九百七十七批，一千四百二十七架次。其中进行轰炸者七十三批，投弹五百九十一枚；进行扫射者三十八批。
    在同一期间内，美国侵略集团不断以飞机侵入我国领空进行直接的武装挑衅。据不完全统计，美机侵入我国领空共达八千二百二十批，三万二千九百九十五架次。其中进行轰炸者一百九十九批，一千三百三十九架次，共投弹二千四百零八枚；进行扫射者一百一十六批，共五百二十六架次。
    五年来蒋贼海军袭击和劫夺我国各种船只四百七十余条，绑架和残害我渔民一千三百余人。
    所有这些事实说明，蒋介石卖国集团是美国侵略集团用来威胁中国安全和亚洲和平的工具。中国人民为了保卫自己的领土完整，为了自身的安全和国际和平，必须解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。
