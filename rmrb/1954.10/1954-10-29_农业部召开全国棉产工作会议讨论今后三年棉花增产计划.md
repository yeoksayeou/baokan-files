Ministry of Agriculture Convenes National Cotton Production Work Conference
Discussing Cotton Production Increase Plan for the Next Three Years

[This newspaper dispatch] The National Cotton Production Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture was held in Beijing from October 15th to 25th. The conference studied the current situation of cotton areas in China, discussed the key areas for expanding cotton fields in the future and the cotton production increase plan for the next three years, and proposed economic and technical measures to increase cotton production.

The conference believes that this spring, after studying the general task of the state during the transition period, Party and government leading organs at all levels and rural work cadres actively led the masses to plant cotton in accordance with the national plan, and finally overfulfilled the task of expanding the planting area, reversing the serious phenomenon of cotton field reduction last year. Although natural disasters were particularly severe this year, and the area of abandoned cotton fields increased five times compared with previous years, the national farmers carried out an overproduction increase campaign, insisted on protecting cotton fields, and improved production technology, so that the total output can still exceed last year.

The conference studied the plan to increase cotton production from 1955 to 1957. According to the needs of national industrial development and people's lives, it is required that the country continue to work hard to increase the yield per unit area of cotton and appropriately expand the cotton planting area in the next three years. It is required that the total cotton output in 1957 will increase by more than 50% compared with this year's output. The conference believes that all provinces should do a good job in ideological mobilization for expanding cotton fields, and the supply of materials such as seeds and fertilizers, as well as technical training, this winter and next spring, which is of great significance for ensuring the completion of next year's cotton planting task.

In order to complete the task of increasing cotton production, the conference first required all localities to ensure the completion of the planting task according to the national plan, and implement the spirit of "planting one mu and guaranteeing one mu" to minimize the abandonment of cotton fields. In the next three years, the expansion of cotton fields will focus on Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan. Sichuan Province has surplus grain, and mountain planting of cotton has been successful, so it can also be regarded as a key area for expanding cotton fields. Some provinces have a lot of wasteland suitable for cotton planting, and they should also actively reclaim wasteland for cotton planting. It is necessary to implement the policy of consolidating old cotton areas and opening up new cotton areas (expanding to scattered cotton areas), and arrange the cotton field planting tasks as early as possible, and appropriately dispatch cadres to the new cotton areas to strengthen technical guidance and make various preparations.

All localities should actively prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and gradually achieve the goal of no reduction in cotton production due to diseases and insect pests. All state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives with a foundation are required to completely eliminate diseases and insect pests in 1955. 666 powder has high efficacy and low price, and the state can supply it in large quantities. All localities should conscientiously promote its use to ensure a substantial increase in cotton production.

The conference also discussed the issue of cotton field fertilizers. The conference believes that under the current conditions, all localities should focus on increasing the accumulation of coarse fertilizer, and plant green manure such as purple alfalfa and yellow alfalfa as much as possible to open up sources of fertilizer. At the same time, considering the lack of fertilizer in cotton areas, and many cotton farmers are accustomed to using commercial fertilizer, it is required to give priority to the supply of commercial fertilizer to cotton and other economic crop areas.

Strengthening scientific research on cotton planting, exchanging advanced technologies, and using various methods to publicize cotton planting technology are effective methods to increase the yield per unit area of cotton. The conference requires all localities to combine scientific theory with practice, pay attention to summarizing advanced experience, and promote it locally to tap the potential for increasing cotton production. In order to strengthen cotton testing and research, the conference decided that representative experimental stations in dryland cotton areas, two-crop cotton areas, saline-alkali cotton areas, irrigated cotton areas, kapok planting areas, Xinjiang, and the Hexi new cotton area in Gansu will conduct scientific research on cotton breeding and improving cultivation techniques.

In order to increase cotton production, the conference suggested that water conservancy departments actively build small-scale water conservancy facilities in new and old cotton areas; vigorously organize the masses to dig canals and wells in northern dryland cotton areas, and prepare for drainage and flood prevention in southern rainy cotton areas, and gradually reduce waterlogging disasters.

### 农业部召开全国棉产工作会议讨论今后三年棉花增产计划

    农业部召开全国棉产工作会议
    讨论今后三年棉花增产计划
    【本报讯】农业部召开的全国棉产工作会议，于十月十五日至二十五日在北京举行。会议研究了我国棉区的现状，讨论了今后扩大棉田的重点区域和今后三年棉花增产计划，并提出了提高棉花产量的经济和技术措施。
    会议认为，今年春天各级党政领导机关和农村工作干部，在学习国家在过渡时期的总任务以后，积极领导群众，按照国家计划种棉，终于超额完成了扩大播种面积的任务，扭转了去年棉田减缩的严重现象。今年自然灾害虽然特别严重，棉田毁弃面积比往年增多五倍，但全国农民开展了超额增产运动，坚持保护棉田，改进生产技术，使总产量仍可超过去年。
    会议研究了一九五五年到一九五七年增产棉花的计划。根据国家工业发展和人民生活的需要，要求全国在今后三年继续努力提高棉花单位面积产量，适当地扩大棉花种植面积。要求一九五七年的棉花总产量，比今年的产量增加百分之五十以上。会议认为，各省应在今冬明春作好扩大棉田的思想动员工作，和种籽、肥料等物资的供应工作以及技术训练工作，这对保证完成明年棉花播种任务有重要意义。
    为了完成增产棉花的任务，会议首先要求各地保证按国家计划完成播种任务，贯彻“种一亩保一亩”的精神尽量减少毁弃棉田。今后三年，扩大棉田以河北、陕西、山西、山东、江苏、河南为重点。四川省粮食有余，而山区植棉已有成就，也可作为扩大棉田的重点。某些省份，有不少荒地宜于植棉，也应积极垦荒植棉。要贯彻巩固老棉区、开辟新棉区（向分散棉区扩大）的方针，把棉田播种任务及早布置下去，并给新棉区适当调派干部，加强技术指导，作好各种准备工作。
    各地应积极防治病虫害，逐步做到不因病虫为害而使棉花减产。要求全部国营农场和有基础的农业生产合作社，在一九五五年内彻底除治病虫害。六六六粉药效力大，价钱低，国家已可大量供应，各地应认真加以推广使用，使棉花增产得到切实保证。
    会议还讨论了棉田肥料问题。会议认为在目前条件下，各地应以增积粗肥为主，并尽可能种植紫穗槐、黄花苜蓿等绿肥，以开辟肥料的来源。同时，考虑到棉区肥料缺乏，已有不少棉农习惯于使用商品肥料，因此要求把商品肥料优先供应棉花和其他经济作物地区。
    加强植棉的科学研究工作、交流先进的技术，采用各种方法进行植棉技术的宣传，是提高棉花单位面积产量的有效方法。会议要求各地把科学理论和实际结合起来，注意总结先进经验，就地推广，以挖掘棉花增产的潜力。为了加强棉花的试验研究工作，会议决定在旱地棉区、两熟制棉区、盐垦棉区、灌溉棉区、木棉种植区、新疆及甘肃河西新棉区，分别由有代表性的试验站进行棉区良种繁育和改进栽培技术的科学研究工作。
  为了提高棉花产量，会议建议水利部门在新老棉区积极兴办小型水利；在北方旱地棉区大力组织群众开渠打井，南方多雨棉区则做好排水防涝的准备工作，逐步减少涝害。
