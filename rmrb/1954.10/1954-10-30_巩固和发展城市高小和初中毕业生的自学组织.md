Consolidate and Develop Self-Study Organizations for Urban Higher Elementary and Junior High School Graduates

In cities, there are a considerable number of higher elementary and junior high school graduates who have not been able to continue their education and are temporarily too young to participate in productive labor. The Party and the People's Government have adopted appropriate organizational forms for them, allowing them to engage in self-study, bringing their lives into a normal track, and improving their knowledge level. Now, many cities have established self-study organizations. The majority of higher elementary and junior high school graduates who have not been able to continue their education and are temporarily unable to participate in production have joined self-study groups. Young Communist League members and Young Pioneers, under the leadership of the Youth League Committee, have established League branches and Young Pioneer teams, engaging in various legitimate and beneficial activities. Their morale has basically stabilized.

Establishing such self-study organizations is undoubtedly a long-term task. It is estimated that in the future, every year there may be a number of higher elementary and junior high school graduates who cannot continue their education and are temporarily unable to participate in productive labor. Thus, organizing them to engage in self-study will inevitably become an indispensable form of social education in the future. At the same time, initial experience has proved that self-study organizations can help higher elementary and junior high school graduates who cannot continue their education to continuously improve ideologically and in terms of cultural knowledge. Therefore, all cities that have not established self-study organizations should establish them; those that have already established such organizations should strive to consolidate them.

However, some local Party committees, educational administrative departments, and Youth League organizations believe that as long as higher elementary and junior high school graduates who have not been able to continue their education quietly return home and do not cause any problems, there is no need to pay attention to them. This is an important reason why self-study organizations in some cities cannot develop. This irresponsible attitude towards the younger generation is obviously wrong. Some comrades, after the establishment of self-study organizations, have become slack and do not understand that constant leadership is necessary. This is an important reason why some self-study organizations cannot be consolidated. However, fearing trouble will not truly solve the problem. Only by adopting a positive attitude and conscientiously organizing and leading the self-study of higher elementary and junior high school graduates can we help them progress and make them useful talents for building a socialist motherland.

On the part of parents, the unanimous demand is: since the children have not continued their education and are temporarily unable to participate in productive labor, they should be organized to continue learning cultural and scientific knowledge and be given the necessary political and ideological education so that they can participate in productive labor or other work in the future. However, some parents have made excessive demands on self-study organizations, demanding that they increase teaching time, add subjects, and even connect with middle schools, completing three years of junior high school courses within five years. This demand is obviously divorced from current actual conditions. Higher elementary school graduates participating in self-study groups are learning outside the school, and the conditions outside the school are different from those inside the school. We cannot make the same demands on self-study groups as we do on schools. Some parents, on the other hand, have a skeptical attitude towards self-study organizations. They do not believe that children can gather together to study properly. We should educate them, eliminate their doubts, and encourage them to actively support their children's self-study activities. The experience of many places shows that parental support and help play a great role in organizing and consolidating children's self-study organizations. Because many self-study organizations study in students' homes, parental supervision and guidance, as well as material assistance, are very important.

The purpose of organizing higher elementary and junior high school graduates to participate in self-study activities is to consolidate and appropriately improve their cultural and scientific knowledge and political understanding so that they can better engage in productive labor or continue their education when conditions permit. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of self-study organizations, the focus should be on consolidating existing knowledge. The situation in Shanghai, Beijing, and other cities shows that most of the higher elementary school graduates who have not entered middle school have relatively poor grades. Therefore, it is entirely correct to first enable them to truly reach the level of higher elementary school graduation through self-study. Now, some cities have already compiled the first year's textbooks, and they should further consider how to compile the second year's textbooks according to the principle of gradual progress to meet the needs of self-study groups.

Organizing higher elementary and junior high school graduates for self-study is social education work and must widely mobilize the strength of all sectors of society to do it well. Some cities, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, have organized self-study guidance committees, absorbing relevant units to participate, with the Youth League Committee taking primary responsibility for daily work. Educational administrative departments should provide the Youth League with assistance in all aspects, especially in solving problems such as teachers, teaching materials, study guidance, and children's activity venues, and should take primary responsibility. We believe that this method is relatively appropriate. However, under the current circumstances, various regions can adopt measures suited to local conditions and should not force uniformity. As for the form of self-study organizations, it can also be resolved according to the same spirit. Forms such as self-study groups and cultural supplementary schools can be adopted in order to attract more higher elementary and junior high school graduates to participate in self-study activities. It is inappropriate for some places to only adopt one form and exclude other forms.

In order to better consolidate and develop self-study organizations for higher elementary and junior high school graduates, all regions must strengthen leadership over this work. First, we must select and train counselors for various self-study organizations. Since counselors are active members of society, they have opportunities to participate in productive labor at any time, and mobility is inevitable. Therefore, on the one hand, we must massively and constantly explore various potentials, select appropriate candidates, train them, and supplement the ranks of counselors; on the other hand, we must strengthen the permanent leadership structure and equip it with a certain number of full-time cadres to lead the work of the counselors. Secondly, the Youth League district committees and educational administrative departments of various cities should regularly formulate activity plans for self-study organizations to better organize children to participate in social work, conduct discussions, and engage in other activities. Cities that have already established or are preparing to establish self-study organizations, if conditions permit, it is best to establish one or several cultural supplementary schools in each district as a support for self-study groups. At the same time, increase the number of children's activity venues, such as children's sports fields, reading rooms, and clubs (even if they are simple, it is better than nothing), for higher elementary and junior high school graduates who cannot continue their education to carry out various activities. When organizing activities for young people and children, all regions should also take appropriate care of them and absorb them to participate. Finally, supplementary reading materials for young people and children are also a matter worthy of attention. The existing number of such reading materials is small and not lively enough. Publishing organizations should widely organize scientists, writers, and teachers to write more of these reading materials according to the needs of young people and children.

Caring about the growth of the younger generation is one of our moral standards. We must mobilize the strength of all sectors of society to actively support children's self-study activities and help them prepare for future participation in productive labor or further education.

### 巩固和发展城市高小和初中毕业生的自学组织

    巩固和发展城市高小和初中毕业生的自学组织
    在城市里，有相当数量未能升学又因年龄太小暂时不能参加生产劳动的高小和初中毕业生，党和人民政府对他们采取了适当的组织形式，让他们进行自学，把他们的生活纳入正常轨道，提高他们的知识水平。现在许多城市已经建立了自学组织，绝大部分未能升学暂时又不能参加生产的高小和初中毕业生，参加了自学小组，其中的青年团员和少年先锋队员，并在团委的领导下，建立了团支部和少年先锋队，从事各种正当有益的活动，他们的情绪基本上稳定下来了。
    建立这种自学组织无疑是一种长期性的工作。估计在今后一定时期内，每年都可能有一批高小和初中毕业生不能升学，暂时又不能参加生产劳动。这样，组织他们进行自学的工作，势必成为今后社会教育必不可少的形式。同时，初步经验已经证明，自学组织可以帮助不能升学的高小和初中毕业生在思想上和文化知识上不断获得进步。因此，凡是没有建立自学组织的城市，都应该建立这种组织；已经建立这种组织的，应努力巩固它。
    然而有些地方的党委、教育行政部门和青年团组织的干部，却认为只要未能升学的高小和初中毕业生安安静静地回到家里，不出什么问题，也就不必再去过问他们的事情。这就是有些城市的自学组织不能得到发展的重要原因。这种对年轻一代不负责任的态度，显然是错误的。也有些同志在自学组织建立以后，松懈下来，不了解不加以经常的领导是不行的，这就是有些自学组织不能巩固的重要原因。然而怕麻烦就不能真正解决问题，只有采取积极态度，认真地组织和领导高小和初中毕业生的自学，才能帮助他们进步，使他们成为建设社会主义祖国的有用人材。
    在家长方面，大家一致的要求是：孩子们既然没有升学，暂时又不能参加生产劳动，那就应当把他们组织起来，继续学习文化科学知识，并且给他们以必要的政治思想教育，以便将来参加生产劳动或其他工作。但是，有些家长对自学组织提出了过高的要求，要求自学组织像正规学校一样，增加授课时间，增加科目，甚至要求它和中学相衔接，在五年之内学完初中三年课程，这种要求显然是脱离当前实际条件的。参加自学小组的高小毕业生是在校外学习，校外和校内的条件是不相同的，我们也就不能像要求学校那样来要求自学小组。而有些家长则对自学组织抱着怀疑的态度。他们不相信孩子们能够聚在一起好好学习。我们应当向他们进行教育，消除他们的疑虑，鼓励他们积极支持孩子们的自学活动。许多地方的经验都说明家长的支持和帮助对于组织和巩固儿童的自学组织有很大作用。因为许多自学组织都是在学生家里学习的，家长的督促指导，以及在物质上给予帮助，都是很重要的。
    组织高小和初中毕业生参加自学活动的目的，是为了巩固和适当提高他们的文化科学知识和政治认识，以便在条件许可的时候能够更好地从事生产劳动或继续升学。所以在自学组织建立之初，应当以巩固原有知识为主。上海、北京等城市的情况说明，未能升入中学的高小毕业生，多半是成绩比较差的。因而经过自学，首先要使他们真正达到高小毕业的程度，这是完全正确的。现在，有的城市已经编好了第一年的教材，还应当根据循序渐进的原则，进一步考虑如何编辑第二年的教材，以满足自学小组的需要。
    组织高小和初中毕业生进行自学是社会教育工作，必须广泛地动员社会各方面的力量才能作好。有的城市在党委统一领导下，组织自学指导委员会，吸收有关单位参加，日常工作则由团委负主要责任。教育行政部门给青年团以各方面的帮助，特别在解决师资、教材、学习指导、儿童活动场所等问题上，更应当负主要责任。我们认为这种办法是比较妥善的。但在目前情况下，各地可以采取因地制宜的办法，而不必强求统一。至于自学组织的形式问题，也可以按照同一精神来解决。自学小组和文化补习学校等等的形式，都是可以采用的，以便吸引更多的高小和初中毕业生参加自学活动。有的地方只是采用一种形式，而排斥其他形式，这是不妥当的。
    为了更好地巩固和发展高小和初中毕业生的自学组织，各地必须加强对这一工作的领导。首先要为各种自学组织选聘、培养辅导员。由于辅导员都是社会青年中的积极分子，他们随时有参加生产劳动的机会，流动性是不可避免的。因此一方面必须大量地、经常地发掘各种潜力，选择适当人选，加以培养训练，补充到辅导员的队伍中去；另一方面要加强经常领导的机构，配备一定的专职干部，以领导辅导员的工作。其次，各城市的团区委和教育行政部门，应当定期拟订自学组织的活动计划，更好地组织孩子们参加社会工作，进行座谈，以及从事其他活动。凡是已经或准备建立自学组织的城市，如果条件许可，最好每个区都设立一所或几所文化补习学校，作为自学小组的依托。同时，增设儿童活动场所，如儿童体育场、阅览室、俱乐部等（即使简陋一些也比没有要好），以供不能升学的高小和初中毕业生进行各种活动。各地在组织青少年的活动时，也应该适当照顾他们、吸收他们参加。最后，青年和少年的辅助读物，也是值得注意的问题。现有的这类读物，数量既少，也不够生动活泼，出版机关应当广泛组织科学家、作家和教师，根据青年少年的需要，多多写作这类读物。
    关心年轻一代的成长，是我们的道德标准之一。我们必须动员社会各个方面的力量，积极支持孩子们的自学活动，帮助他们作好将来参加生产劳动或继续升学的准备。
