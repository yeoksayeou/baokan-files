Northeast Normal University's correspondence education has had a positive impact on improving the quality of secondary education in Northeast China, and has provided experience for other higher normal colleges and universities across the country to carry out correspondence education.

Under the direction of the Ministry of Education, Northeast Normal University, learning from the correspondence education experience of the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe, began to run correspondence education in May 1953, based on the situation and needs of middle school teachers in the Northeast region. This was done so that in-service middle school teachers could systematically study the main courses of the normal school program without leaving their jobs, improve their professional level and teaching quality, and be able to competently perform teaching work. Currently, there are 998 junior high school Chinese language and mathematics teachers with the equivalent of senior high school education participating in the Chinese language and mathematics correspondence courses offered by Northeast Normal University. This correspondence education has been initiated in 42 small and medium-sized cities and counties along the main railways in the Northeast region, with 19 correspondence teaching and tutoring stations established in central locations. Northeast Normal University's main campus and relevant departments have established specialized institutions for correspondence education, and a number of part-time and full-time teachers have compiled correspondence teaching materials and conducted key lectures. Over the past year, this correspondence education has gradually consolidated and become more standardized. Textbooks suitable for correspondence education are being compiled one after another, and various necessary systems such as student status management and subject examinations have been clearly defined. Many middle school teachers have significantly improved their teaching quality after correspondence learning.

Recently, Northeast Normal University invited relevant officials from education departments in some provinces and cities and directors of some correspondence teaching and tutoring stations to hold a correspondence education work conference. The Ministry of Education also sent representatives to attend the conference. The conference summarized the experience of establishing correspondence education over the past year, and discussed and revised the correspondence education regulations. In order to strengthen cooperation in correspondence education work, Northeast Normal University and the education departments of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces also passed the "Agreement on Strengthening the Organizational Leadership of Correspondence Education," and exchanged views on further developing correspondence education.

    东北师范大学创办的函授教育对提高中学教育质量起了良好作用
    东北师范大学创办的函授教育，对提高东北区中学教育质量产生了良好作用，并对全国其他高等师范院校开展函授教育工作，提供了经验。
    东北师范大学在教育部指示下，学习苏联及东欧各人民民主国家的函授教育经验，根据东北地区中学教师的情况和需要，从一九五三年五月开始兴办函授教育，以便使在职中学教师能够不脱离工作岗位，系统地学习师范专修科的主要课程，提高业务水平和教学质量，能够胜任教学工作。现在，东北师范大学所办的中国语文和数学两个函授专修班，共有相当于高级中学文化程度的初中语文和数学教师九百九十八人参加学习。在东北区主要铁路沿线四十二个中小市、县都已开始了这种函授教育，并在中心地点设立了十九个函授教学辅导站。东北师范大学校部和有关的系都已建立了专门进行函授教育工作的机构，并有一部分兼职和专职的教师编写函授教材和进行重点的讲授。一年多以来，这种函授教育已逐渐巩固和正规起来，适合于函授教育的教材正在陆续编写，学籍管理、学科考试等各项必要的制度也都有了明确的规定。不少中学教师，经过函授学习，教学质量有了显著的提高。
    最近，东北师范大学邀集部分省市教育部门有关负责人和部分函授教学辅导站主任，召开了函授教育工作会议，教育部也派人出席了这次会议。会议上总结了一年多来创办函授教育的经验，讨论并修订了函授教育章程。为了加强在函授教育工作中的配合，东北师范大学和辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省教育厅之间还通过了“关于加强函授教育的组织领导工作协议”，并对进一步发展函授教育交换了意见。　（新华社）
