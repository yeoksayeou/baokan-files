Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China issued instructions on October 8, urging state-owned commercial departments at all levels to rapidly transport industrial products to the countryside to meet farmers' needs for daily necessities after selling agricultural products.

The peak trade season in rural areas has already begun. This year, grain, cotton, and oil crops are all purchased by the state under a unified purchase system, resulting in a large and concentrated amount of currency in circulation. Therefore, the vigorous supply of daily-use industrial products to farmers by state-owned commercial departments at all levels has become an important link in ensuring the state's autumn agricultural product procurement, invigorating the urban and rural economy, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, it is also of great significance for the normal progress of daily-use industrial product production in cities next year.

The instructions pointed out that state-owned commercial departments at all levels should quickly implement the following measures:

	1. Immediately mobilize resources and use all available means of transportation to transfer commodities stored in provincial companies and secondary stations to grassroots stores according to the signed fourth-quarter contracts. In addition to actively promoting sales, each store should promptly submit supplementary requests to the secondary stations based on market developments. The secondary stations should be responsible for supplying goods based on the overall situation.

	2. Rely on and actively assist cooperatives. Further help cooperatives to improve their plans, and establish close connections with cooperatives in business operations. Cooperatives should gradually implement a contract system based on market and residents' needs, and state-owned companies should gradually implement a contract system based on the supply of goods in order to strengthen the close ties between the two parties. Three-level stores should fully meet the needs of the cooperatives for commodities that are in stock, and should not be reluctant to sell. If the stock is not available, they should be responsible for requesting supplementary goods from the secondary stations. If the secondary stations have the stock, they should supply it all. If the warehouse has no stock, they are also responsible for immediately requesting goods from the central station or other purchasing stations to ensure timely supply.

	3. For private retailers and itinerant vendors in urban and rural areas, wholesale business should be actively and systematically continued to organize and lead them to better serve the work of commodity circulation in the vast urban and rural areas. At present, in cities where there is no state-owned commercial wholesale business, state-owned stores should be responsible for strengthening wholesale; where the division of labor is the responsibility of cooperatives, the cooperatives should be responsible for supply, and state-owned stores should actively help cooperatives to carry out this work. If individual local cooperatives still have genuine difficulties in this supply business and are unable to undertake it, state-owned stores should continue to undertake the wholesale work for cooperatives and private retailers.

	4. Appropriately expand the organization of three-level stores and increase staff according to actual needs.

	5. According to actual needs, under the unified leadership of the county finance committee, state-owned companies and cooperatives should jointly be responsible for convening commodity exchange meetings in primary markets to expand commodity circulation.

    商业部指示各级国营商业部门
    迅速调运工业品供应农民需要
    【新华社十七日讯】中华人民共和国商业部十月八日发出指示，督促各级国营商业部门迅速运送工业品下乡，满足农民出售农产品后对日用百货的需要。
    目前农村的贸易旺季已经开始。今年的粮食、棉花和油料作物都由国家统购，货币投放数额很大，而且集中。为此，各级国营商业部门大力供应农民日用工业品，已成为保证国家秋后农产品收购、活跃城乡经济、巩固工农联盟的一个重要环节。同时，对明年城市日用工业品生产的正常进行，也有重要意义。
    指示指出，各级国营商业部门应迅速实行下列措施：
    一，立即动员力量，利用一切能够利用的运输工具，把省公司以及二级站所存的商品，按照已签订的第四季度的合同，迅速地调拨到基层商店去，各商店除积极大力推销外，应根据市场发展情况，及时地向二级站提出补充要货，二级站应结合全面情况，负责供应。
    二，依靠并积极地帮助合作社。进一步帮助合作社做好计划，并在业务上和合作社取得密切衔接。合作社应根据市场和居民的需要，国营公司应根据货源供应情况逐步推行联系合同制，以增强双方的紧密联系。合作社需要的商品，三级商店库存有的，应充分满足，不得惜售，库存没有的，应负责向二级站补充要货，二级站库存有的应全部供应，如仓库没有存货，也有责任立即向中央站或其他采购站迅速要货，及时供应。
    三，对私营零售商和城乡货郎担，应积极地有计划地继续进行批销业务，组织和领导他们更好地为广大城乡商品流通的工作服务。目前凡是没有国营商业批发业务的城市，应由国营商店负责加强批发；分工由合作社负责的，应由合作社负责供应，国营商店并应积极帮助合作社开展此项工作。如个别地方合作社目前对此项供应业务仍确有困难，未能担负起来的，国营商店应继续担负对合作社和私营零售商的批销工作。
    四，根据实际需要情况，相应地扩大三级商店的机构和增加工作人员。
    五，根据实际需要，在县财委统一领导下，由国营公司和合作社共同负责，召开初级市场的物资交流会，扩大商品流通。
