Disaster victims who have returned to their homes in Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei Province, have settled down and are now actively draining water and rushing to replant. The Lianqun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hanchuan County has led more than 60 individual farmers to participate in waterlogging drainage. Concentrating six waterwheels, they drained more than 100 mu in three days and replanted all of it with crops. Huangjiang Township in Yunmeng County, under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, drained more than 200 mu and replanted more than 1,200 mu of crops. Through water drainage and replanting, damming, and sideline production, the township has newly organized 30 mutual aid teams, with more than 480 peasant households participating. As of now, the entire prefecture has replanted more than 300,000 mu, with approximately 150,000 mu currently being replanted. (Yao Xingti)

After Cang County, Hebei Province, suffered from flooding, the CCP Cang County Committee organized more than 160 cadres to go to the countryside to lead farmers in organizing and carrying out production for self-relief. To date, more than 24,800 peasant households in the county have organized 1,488 agricultural production cooperatives, developing more than 20 kinds of sideline production, such as making shoe soles, braiding straw hat braids, managing fish, and embroidery. They can earn more than 123 million yuan per day, which can be exchanged for more than 137,000 jin of coarse grains, solving the daily living expenses of 130,000 people.

In organizing farmers for production and self-relief, attention has been paid to solving the sales problems of sideline and handicraft products. The Cang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent cadres to cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Shenyang, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to solicit sales for 400,500 pairs of shoe soles, 100,000 pairs of shoe flowers, more than 80,000 straw hats, and more than 24,000 brooms, pot brushes, bamboo sieves, rolling pins, pot lids, carrying baskets, and other household utensils.

While developing various sideline and handicraft industries, the farmers were organized to salvage remaining autumn crops, cut grass, collect wild vegetables, and grass seeds. According to incomplete statistics, the county has already had more than 70,000 people collect more than 35.27 million jin of dry grass, more than 1.36 million jin of grass seeds, and more than 1.27 million jin of wild vegetables, solving some of the production and living difficulties of the disaster victims.

    湖北省孝感专区灾民返乡后积极排水抢种
    中共河北沧县县委领导灾民组织起来生产自救
    湖北省孝感专区返乡后的灾民都已安居下来，现正积极排水抢种，汉川县联群农业生产合作社带动了六十多户单干农民参加排渍，集中了六辆水车，三天时间就排渍一百余亩，并全部抢种上了作物。云梦县黄江乡在互助合作组织带动下排渍二百余亩，抢种作物一千二百余亩，全乡通过排水抢种、堵口和副业生产等工作，新组织了三十个互助组，参加农民四百八十多户。截至目前为止全专区已抢种三十余万亩，正在抢种的约十五万亩。　（姚行悌）
    河北省沧县遭受水灾后，中共沧县县委组织了一百六十多名干部下乡，领导农民组织起来开展生产自救。到目前止，全县已有二万四千八百多户农民组织起一千四百八十八个农业生产合作社，开展了纳鞋底、掐草帽辫、治鱼和刺绣等二十多种副业生产，每天能收入一亿二千三百多万元，可换回十三万七千多斤粗粮，解决十三万人一天的生活费用。
    在组织农民生产自救当中，注意解决了副业和手工业产品的销路问题。沧县供销合作社派干部到北京、天津、石家庄、沈阳、上海、广州等城市揽销了四十万零五千双鞋底、十万双鞋花、八万多顶草帽，还有二万四千多件笤帚、炊帚、竹筛、擀面杖、锅盖、抬筐等零用家什。
    在开展各种副业和手工业的同时，有组织地领导农民进行了打捞残秋、打草、采集野菜和草籽等工作。现在全县不完全统计，已有七万多人打干草三千五百二十七万多斤，草籽一百三十六万多斤，野菜一百二十七万多斤，解决了一些灾民生产和生活的困难。
