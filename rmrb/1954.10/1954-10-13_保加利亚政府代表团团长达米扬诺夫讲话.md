Dear comrades and friends:

    We have participated in the grand celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and visited your country. Now, as we are about to leave your beautiful motherland, please allow me, on behalf of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, to express our deepest gratitude for the warm hospitality you have extended to us.

    We, along with the entire Bulgarian people, have long been aware of the heroic struggle waged by the great Chinese people against domestic and foreign enemies. This struggle has enabled the Chinese people to achieve complete liberation from generations of enslavement. We know the great achievements of the Chinese people in establishing a true people's regime and fundamentally transforming the national economy along the socialist road.

    Our visit to your country, the opportunity to meet with the leaders of the People's Republic of China, and to meet and talk with workers and peasants, have enabled us to personally experience the indestructible moral and political unity of the great Chinese people, and the confidence and determination shown by the Chinese people in advancing along the glorious path of liberation, peace, democracy, and socialism guided by the Communist Party of China.

    We have seen with our own eyes that the Chinese people are an indestructible bulwark in defending world peace.

    As we leave your country, we would like to wish you, our dear comrades and friends, even greater achievements in further consolidating the people's democratic regime and in the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of your free motherland, in your struggle to liberate Taiwan, unite all the Chinese people, and defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

    Long live the great Chinese people! Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the great Chinese people!

    Long live the great friendship among the people of the world, led by the Soviet Union, who are struggling to defend peace!

    保加利亚政府代表团团长达米扬诺夫讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们参加了中华人民共和国成立五周年的国庆盛典，访问了你们的国家，现在就要离开你们美丽的祖国了，请允许我代表保加利亚人民共和国政府代表团，对你们所给予我们的热情的款待，表示深深的感谢。
    我们和全体保加利亚人民一样，很早以前就知道伟大的中国人民所进行的反对国内外敌人的英勇斗争。这个斗争使中国人民从世世代代的奴役中获得了完全的解放。我们知道中国人民在建立真正人民政权并按照社会主义道路根本改造国民经济的事业中所获得的巨大成就。
    我们访问了你们的国家，有机会与中华人民共和国的领导者们见面，跟工人和农民会晤、谈话，这一切使我们亲自体会到伟大的中国人民的不可摧毁的道义上和政治上的团结一致，体会到中国人民在沿着光荣的中国共产党所引导的和平、民主、社会主义的解放道路前进中，所表现出来的信心和决心。
    我们亲眼看到了中国人民是一个不可摧毁的保卫世界和平的堡垒。
    当我们离开你们的国家的时刻，谨祝你们，我们亲爱的同志们和朋友们，在进一步巩固人民民主政权以及全面发展你们自由祖国的经济和文化的事业中，在你们解放台湾、团结全中国人民和保卫远东和全世界的持久和平的斗争中，获得更重大的成就。
    伟大的中国人民，伟大的中国人民的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    以苏联为首的为保卫和平而斗争的全世界人民之间的伟大友谊万岁！
