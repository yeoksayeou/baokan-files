    On Soviet Drama Education
    Shakov
    Not long ago, I participated in a delegation to the Soviet Union organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The main task of this delegation was to go to the Soviet Union to attend the "May Day" International Labor Day celebration, to enhance the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The second task was to introduce to the Soviet people the political, economic, cultural, educational, scientific, artistic, and other aspects of China since liberation, as well as the current living conditions of Chinese youth, women, and other sectors of the population. The third task was to visit and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in various fields. Because most of the visits and activities in the Soviet Union were of a general nature, and few were professional, I only made a cursory visit to two Soviet state-run drama academies regarding Soviet drama education, and held three symposiums. The timing of this visit was also unfortunate, as it coincided with the Soviet schools being busy preparing for or having already begun their final exams, making it impossible to conduct in-depth investigations and research, which greatly affected our learning in the field of drama education in the Soviet Union. Here, I will only organize the oral and written materials that I have tried my best to collect, for readers to refer to.
      I. General Situation of Two Drama Academies
    On May 26, we visited the Leningrad State Ostrovsky Institute of Dramatic Art. This academy was established after the October Revolution on the basis of several drama schools. In the mid-1930s, it was changed to a drama specialty school. Later, it was restored as an academy. The academy has four departments: acting, directing, drama theory, and stage design. There are a total of 230 students, including students from the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries such as Bulgaria and North Korea. It also has specialized training classes for various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. In addition to the Russian class, there are currently six ethnic classes (Mari, Tuva, Khakas, Karelia-Finland, Komi, Buryat-Mongol, etc.). The academic system is four years for the acting and stage design departments, and five years for the directing and drama theory departments. One of the founders of the academy, and also the first president, was the famous Soviet director (currently the chief director of the Leningrad State Pushkin Drama Theater), Er. Shi. Vifyein. The current president, Serebryakov, has been working at the academy for more than 20 years. In addition to administrative leadership, he also teaches acting classes.
    This academy can be said to have achieved remarkable results and rich experience in drama teaching. This also comes from hard work. The president of the academy, in his conversation with us, detailed the enormous difficulties and heroic struggles the academy encountered when the enemy besieged the city of Leningrad during the Great Patriotic War. He said that the academy did not close down during the Great Patriotic War, and most of the school buildings were destroyed by enemy planes. In 1942, the academy moved to the Caucasus, Tomsk, Novosibirsk, and other places, and teaching work continued. After the victory, it returned to Leningrad, and the students repaired the school buildings with their own labor.
    The academy is proud that more than 80% of the actors in all the drama theaters in Leningrad graduated from this academy. Among them are many famous actors in the entire Soviet Union (some have won the titles of People's Artist or Honored Artist), such as N. Simonov, N. Cherkasov, B. Chirkov, V. Merkuriev, O. Kaziko, Yu. Daurebiev, I. Gusheva, I. Zarubinaya, V. Polyceimaiko, T. Dudnikov, N. Varliyanov, B. Smirnov, V. Soshal'skaya, A. Raikin, and others.
    After we returned to Moscow from Leningrad, we visited the State Lunacharsky Institute of Theater Arts on June 5.
    The Moscow State Lunacharsky Institute of Theater Arts is the oldest and largest higher drama school in the entire Soviet Union. Some say that for the entire process of the development of Soviet drama education, the path taken by the first major higher drama school in the Soviet Union—the Moscow State Lunacharsky Institute of Theater Arts—is the most characteristic. This fully demonstrates the historical characteristics of this academy and its important role and position in Soviet drama education. Its growth and development have gone through many tortuous roads. It has waged persistent and fierce struggles against various anti-realist artistic ideas hostile to the Soviet Union, and achieved victory, advancing along the path of the Stanislavsky system that truly embodies socialist realism.
    This highest institution of Soviet drama education today was established on the basis of the music and drama school run by the Music Lovers Association before the revolution. In 1918, it was renamed the Institute of Music and Drama. In 1922, it was reorganized into the State Institute of Theater Arts with drama, musical comedy, and directing departments. Because it did not initially obtain sufficient organizational experience, and did not gather a group of new-style teaching staff who mastered advanced methods of training actors and mastered Marxist-Leninist theory, it had to change the academy into the Central Institute of Dramatic Art in 1924. In 1931, the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic passed a resolution to revise the art education system; and re-examine and expand the distribution network of higher art schools. Thus, on the basis of the Central Institute of Dramatic Art, the State Institute of Theater Arts named after Lunacharsky was established.
    In addition to training drama actors, the acting department of this academy also trains actors for musical comedies (a form of drama with singing and dialogue). The directing department trains directors for dramas and operas, as well as ballet instructors. There is also a drama theory department, which trains drama theory and criticism talents. In addition to Russian students, the acting department currently has five ethnic classes (Kazakh, Turkmen, Kyrgyz, Avar, Lezgin, etc.), and also accepts more than 50 students from countries such as China, North Korea, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Spain, and Iran. The academy has more than 500 students in total. The duration of study is five years for all departments and classes except for the Russian class in the acting department, which is four years. In addition, the academy also has a fairly large correspondence department, with acting and drama theory departments, with 350 students. Its purpose is to enable in-service drama cadres who have not received higher drama education and do not have the opportunity to go to school to receive the same education and training.
    II. The Importance Attached to Drama
        Education by the Soviet Party and Government
    After the victory of the October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet regime, the first new-type higher drama school in the Soviet Union was immediately established in the capital, Moscow. At that time, the young Soviet government launched drama education work under extremely difficult conditions of domestic war.
    Before the revolution, there was not a single higher drama school in Russia under the rule of the Tsar, but the development of Soviet drama education after the victory of the October Revolution was very rapid. Before the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union already had four higher drama schools, and in 1947 it increased to fourteen, and by 1950 there were more than twenty. There were eleven drama specialty schools in 1947, and by 1950 it had increased to forty-three. As for the drama research institutes attached to major theaters in the Soviet Union, there has also been great development: in 1943 there were fifty-eight research institutes, and by 1947 it had increased to eighty-five. Although the current statistics on Soviet drama schools have not yet been found, it is conceivable that it must far exceed the above figures. Even the above incomplete figures are extremely convincing. This is sufficient to prove that, thanks to the Soviet Party and government's attention and support for drama education, such great achievements have been made in this area.
    The Soviet Party and government deeply understand that drama education is the most important link in the entire process of the Soviet drama industry. The resolution of the drama work conference convened in 1927 under the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union clearly pointed out that if drama education is not earnestly established and developed, it will not be possible to truly grasp the main departments in drama work. In 1918, the Drama Department under the People's Education Committee of the Soviet government, headed by Lunacharsky, announced a "Working Program." This "Working Program" became an important document in the history of the development of Soviet drama and drama education. In it, not only were the general tasks for the construction of socialist new drama stipulated, but also all the principled issues related to drama education were included. Currently, the Soviet government's Ministry of Culture has a special Administration Bureau for Higher Art Education, with a deputy minister serving as the director. This also shows that the Soviet Party and government's attention to art education (including drama education) has been consistent.
    III. Growth and Development in Struggle
    Before the October Revolution, in the 1890s, Russian drama education experienced a brief period of prosperity. At that time, A.P. Lensky presided over the drama training class at the Little Theater, V.N. Davydov ran a drama training class in Petersburg, and Nemirovich-Danchenko was engaged in training actors at the Moscow Music Amateur School. The first group of actors who joined the Moscow Art Theater in 1898 were trained in this school. But they were conducting teaching work under extremely difficult conditions at that time: on the one hand, they had to strive for survival under the Tsar's feudal autocratic rule, and on the other hand, they had to wage a resolute struggle against the reactionary and conservative ideas of the Royal Theater Administration and the backward ideas of some people in the drama industry who advocated "down with schools, down with training."
    Outstanding representatives of Russia's advanced drama art, such as I.A. Dmitrievsky, M.S. Shchepkin, I.V. Samarin, V.N. Davydov, A.P. Lensky, and others, put forward many advanced teaching ideas. They believed that the main task of drama education was not only the professional training of actors, making them experts who could master proficient techniques, but also to enable actors to influence the audience by ideologically revealing the noble qualities of people through their art. This central issue of drama education—the issue of political and ideological education—could only be thoroughly resolved in the Soviet era. In fact, after the October Revolution, Soviet drama schools used the system of the genius actor, director, and educator K.S. Stanislavsky as a foundation to train young actors, and combined artistic training with political and ideological education.
    In the early days of Soviet drama education, as in other cultural and ideological fields, a two-front struggle was carried out. That is to say, on the one hand, it was necessary to oppose the right-wing idea of ​​blindly worshiping bourgeois culture and attempting to mechanically transport it to Soviet society, and on the other hand, it was also necessary to oppose the "left-wing" attitude of the theorists of the anti-Marxist "proletarian culture" faction who advocated simply rejecting all cultural heritage. Regarding the old schools left over from the Tsarist era, Lenin pointed out: "...to distinguish the bad things from the old schools from the things that are beneficial to us, and should be good at selecting from the old schools the things that communism needs." Therefore, the old drama teaching staff needed to undergo ideological reform, and the leadership members and various systems of the schools were in urgent need of reform. This was an arduous task in the early days of Soviet drama education.
    During the economic recovery period after 1921, a fierce struggle took place between the realistic school of Soviet drama and the formalists of the "Left Wing Front" over the role of actors. The formalists opposed the idea that actors were independent artists, and denied that actors shouldered the great task of expressing the themes of the times with their own creativity. They arbitrarily reduced the role of actors to obediently executing the director's tasks. However, A.P. Petrovsky, a famous teacher at the academy, brought the excellent realistic traditions of Alexandrinsky's performing arts to teaching, and under his leadership, a large number of teachers rose up to oppose the reactionary factions disguised as leftists, opposed distorting the creative role of actors, and fought for realistic drama art.
    On April 23, 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made a historic and important resolution on reorganizing literary and artistic groups and abolishing the RAPP (Russian Association of Proletarian Writers), which exposed "leftist" reactionary ideas and promoted the great unity of Soviet literary and artistic workers. Soviet drama education also began a new stage from then on. The Stanislavsky system finally gained a leading position in the training of Soviet actors. In 1935, Er. Mo. Leonidov, Mo. Mo. Tarkhanov, and V.G. Sakhnovsky, outstanding workers of the Moscow Art Theater, who were also excellent students and comrades-in-arms of Stanislavsky, came to work at the State Lunacharsky Institute of Theater Arts, opening a new era in the history of the academy's development.
    IV. An Urgent and Serious Task
    In order to establish and develop the drama art of various republics and ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, it is first necessary to prepare various drama cadres for each ethnic group. This is an urgent and serious task facing Soviet drama. After the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, in 1918-1919, the Drama Department of the Soviet People's Education Committee established a Committee for the Drama of National Minorities. Its work regulations stated: "The Drama Department of the People's Education Committee believes that drama art is the most revolutionary and urgent in its essence, and therefore, among its many tasks, preparing conditions for the emergence and prosperity of the drama of various ethnic groups in Russia occupies a glorious position. The drama of these ethnic groups is either still in a small range until now, or there is no drama at all."
    Therefore, since 1930, the Soviet State Institute of Theater Arts has continuously trained various drama cadres for various republics and ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, and even trained entire troupes for the theaters of some ethnic minority republics. At present, the Moscow State Institute of Theater Arts is training drama cadres for five ethnic groups such as Kazakh, and the Leningrad State Institute of Theater Arts is training complete drama cadres for the theaters of six ethnic groups such as Mari. Among the graduates of the State Institute of Theater Arts, there are many outstanding and famous ethnic artists.
    Each ethnic class in the acting departments of the two State Institutes of Theater Arts in Moscow and Leningrad has about 20 students. They are all selected from the most talented young people who actively participate in amateur art activities in their respective ethnic areas. After five years of study, several different types of plays are rehearsed. After graduation, all the students in the class, with the rehearsed plays, return to their original ethnic areas, or join local theaters, or become the backbone of newly built theaters. They can then publicly perform the plays rehearsed at the school. This method of training ethnic drama cadres is very good and worthy of our learning.
    V. Key Issues
    In order to run a school well, two key issues must be resolved: the issue of teaching materials and the issue of teachers. These have been resolved in Soviet drama education. The Moscow State Lunacharsky Institute of Theater Arts and the Leningrad State Ostrovsky Institute of Theater Arts have many good experiences worth learning in the approaches they have taken to resolving these two key issues. Here, I can only briefly describe one or two.
    The people in charge of the two drama academies in Moscow and Leningrad all told me that in order to solve the issues of teaching materials and teachers, it is necessary to establish and strengthen the work of the teaching and research sections. The task of scientific research in the teaching and research sections is first to compile the teaching materials well, that is to say, each course must stipulate a teaching syllabus, lecture outline, and even relatively complete textbooks. As far as I personally know: in terms of teaching materials, in addition to the fact that various courses have teaching syllabuses that have been discussed and approved by the teaching and research sections, the above-mentioned two academies have lecture outlines for two courses—acting techniques and the history of Soviet Russian drama—which have been reviewed and approved by the Soviet government's Ministry of Culture and have been printed and published. Another course, the history of Western European drama, has been compiled by the teachers of the research section of the course, headed by S.S. Mogursky, into a large volume of selected readings on the history of Western European drama, Volume 1, which was printed and published last year.
    Training young teachers and cadres is also an important task of the teaching and research sections. The teaching and research sections have postgraduate classes. After three years of graduation, those with excellent grades mostly serve as teaching assistants, or are assigned to other jobs. However, the issue of teachers in an academy cannot be solved solely by the teaching and research sections, nor can it be solved solely by the higher-level competent departments transferring a number of drama cadres who are competent for teaching work to serve as full-time teachers in the academy. This mainly relies on the academy, with the support and help of the Party and government, uniting a group of the most outstanding drama artists (famous actors, directors, drama theorists, and educators) around itself, and absorbing them to teach part-time at the academy. The two most important higher drama schools in the Soviet Union, Moscow and Leningrad, solved the issue of teachers in this way. Many art masters are outstanding teachers at the Moscow Art Theater. For a long time, the directing class of the academy was led by V.G. Sakhnovsky, an outstanding director and excellent dramatist of the Moscow Art Theater. He absorbed almost all the main directors of various theaters in Moscow to participate in the teaching work of the directing class of the academy. The situation of the Leningrad State Ostrovsky Institute of Theater Arts in solving the issue of teachers is the same as that of Moscow.
    Absorbing outstanding dramatists who are engaged in practical work in the theater to serve as part-time teachers not only overcomes the difficulty of the academy lacking teaching staff, but also enables these dramatists engaged in practical work to continuously enrich the teaching content with new experiences gained in drama art practice. This helps to gradually improve the quality of teaching and also helps to avoid the tendency of teaching being divorced from reality.
    The main reason why the Soviet Union has been able to successfully adopt the above-mentioned approach to solve one of the key issues that must be resolved in order to run a school well—the issue of teachers—is because the outstanding Soviet dramatists headed by Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko all regarded engaging in teaching work and training young cadres as their due responsibility to the country's drama industry. Nemirovich-Danchenko once said: "I am willing to put all my enthusiasm into drama education." This enthusiasm is also possessed by every great Russian dramatist in the 19th century, such as I.A. Dmitrievsky, M.S. Shchepkin, I.V. Samarin, V.N. Davydov, A.P. Lensky, and others, as well as every outstanding representative of Soviet drama. It was this enthusiasm that cultivated the successors of the excellent traditions of progressive Russian drama art in the past, and after the October Revolution, it helped Soviet drama education, and also helped the entire Soviet drama industry achieve brilliant achievements and rapid development.

    关于苏联的戏剧教育
    沙可夫
    不久以前我参加了由中苏友好协会总会组织的一个访苏代表团。这个代表团的主要任务是赴苏联参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼，以增强中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，其次是向苏联人民介绍中国解放以来政治、经济、文化、教育、科学、艺术等各方面工作情况以及中国青年妇女等各方面人民生活的现状，再其次才是参观访问，以学习苏联各方面的先进经验。由于在苏联各地参观访问活动属于一般性质的多，专业的少，因而关于苏联的戏剧教育，我只走马看花地参观了两个苏联国立的戏剧学院，进行了三次座谈，而这次去参观时机会又不碰巧，正赶着苏联学校忙于准备或已开始学年大考的时候，不可能作深入的调查研究，大大影响了我们在苏联进行有关戏剧教育方面的学习。这里仅就我尽力搜集到的一点口头的和书面的材料，加以整理，供读者参考。
      一、两个戏剧学院的一般情况
    我们于五月二十六日在列宁格勒参观访问了国立奥斯特洛夫斯基戏剧艺术学院。这个学院是在十月革命后在几个戏剧学校的基础上成立起来的。三十年代中曾改为戏剧专科学校。后来才恢复为学院。学院设四个系：表演系、导演系、戏剧理论系和舞台装置系。学生共二百三十人，除苏联本国学生外，也有保加利亚、朝鲜等新民主主义国家学生，并设立了苏联各民族的专门训练班，除俄罗斯班外，现共有六个民族班（马里、土瓦、哈卡斯、卡累利阿·芬兰、科米、布利亚蒙古等）。学制为表演和舞台装置两系各四年，导演和戏剧理论两系各五年。学院的创办人之一，也是首任院长是苏联名导演（现为列宁格勒国立普希金话剧院总导演），耳·史·维甫耶恩，现任院长塞列勃略柯夫在该院工作已达二十余年，他除行政领导工作外兼任表演课的教学。
    这个学院在戏剧教学工作上可以说是成绩卓著，经验丰富。这也是从艰苦奋斗中得来的。该院院长在和我们的谈话中，曾详述学院在卫国战争中敌人包围列宁格勒城的时候所遭到的莫大困难和英勇奋斗的经历。他说，在卫国战争中学院没有停办，校舍大部被敌机炸毁。一九四二年学院转移高加索、托姆斯克、新西比利尔斯克等地，教学工作仍继续进行，胜利后回到列宁格勒，学生用自己的劳动修复了校舍。
    这个学院值得骄傲的是：列宁格勒所有话剧院的演员有百分之八十以上是从这个学院毕业出来的。其中有许多全苏联有名的演员（有的已荣获人民演员，或功勋演员的称号），如纳·西蒙诺夫、纳·契尔卡索夫、勃·契尔柯夫、佛·密尔库里也夫、奥·卡细柯、优·道陆别也夫、伊·古雪华亚、伊·扎鲁平娜雅、佛·波里采伊玛珂、特·杜德尼可夫、纳·瓦尔利雅诺、勃·斯米尔诺夫、佛·索夏尔斯基卡雅、阿·拉伊金等人。
    我们从列宁格勒回莫斯科后，六月五日才去访问国立卢那却尔斯基戏剧艺术学院。
    莫斯科国立卢那却尔斯基戏剧艺术学院是全苏联历史最久，规模最大的一个高等戏剧学校。有人说对于苏维埃戏剧教育发展的全部过程来说，苏联第一所主要的高等戏剧学校—莫斯科国立卢那却尔斯基戏剧艺术学院——所经过的道路是最有特征的。这充分说明了这个学院的历史特点及其在苏维埃戏剧教育中的重要作用和地位。它的成长和发展经过了不少曲折的道路。它在和苏维埃敌对的各种各样反现实主义的艺术思想作了坚持的剧烈的斗争，并取得了胜利，沿着真正体现着社会主义现实主义的史坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系的道路向前迈进。
    这所目前苏联戏剧教育的最高学府是在革命前音乐爱好者协会所办的音乐、戏剧学校的基础上建立起来的，一九一八年改称为音乐戏剧学院，一九二二年改组为设有话剧系、音乐剧系、导演系的国立戏剧艺术学院。由于一开始没有获得足够的组织经验，没有集中一批掌握先进的培养演员的方法和掌握了马克思列宁主义理论的新式教学干部，不得不于一九二四年把学院改为中央戏剧艺术专科学校。到了一九三一年，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国人民委员会通过改订艺术教育制度的决议；并重新审查和扩大高等艺术学校的分布网，于是在中央戏剧艺术专科学校的基础上成立了以卢那却尔斯基为名的国立戏剧艺术学院。
    这个学院的表演系除培养话剧演员外，还培养音乐剧（即有唱有白的一种喜剧形式的戏剧）的演员，导演系培养话剧和歌剧的导演以及舞剧指导，另设戏剧理论系，培养戏剧理论和批评人材。表演系除俄罗斯学生外，现设五个民族班（哈萨克、土库曼、吉尔吉斯、阿华尔斯、列兹金等），同时吸收了五十多个中、朝、波、捷、匈、罗、西班牙、伊朗等国学生。该院共有学生五百余人。学习期限，除表演系俄罗斯班为四年外，其余各系各班都是五年。此外该院还设了一个规模相当大的函授部，有表演和戏剧理论两部门，学生三百五十人，其目的是使没有受过高等戏剧教育而又没有机会进学校学习的在职戏剧干部，可得到同样的教育和培养。
    二、苏联党和政府对戏剧
        教育事业的重视
    十月革命胜利，苏维埃政权一建立以后，马上在首都莫斯科就成立了第一所苏维埃的新型的高等戏剧学校。当时年轻的苏维埃政府在极端困难的国内战争的条件下展开了戏剧教育工作。
    革命前在沙皇统治下的俄罗斯没有一所高等戏剧学校，而十月革命胜利后苏维埃戏剧教育事业的发展是很迅速的。伟大的卫国战争以前苏联就已经有了四所高等戏剧学校，而一九四七年增加到十四所，到了一九五○年已有二十所以上。戏剧专科学校在一九四七年有十一所，到了一九五○年就增加到四十三所。至于附设在苏联各大剧院的戏剧研究所也有很大的发展：一九四三年有五十八个研究所，而到了一九四七年就增加到八十五个了。虽一时尚未找得目前苏联戏剧学校统计数字，但可想而知，一定远远超过以上的数目字。即使以上不完全的数目字就已极有说服力。这足可以证明：由于苏联党和政府对戏剧教育事业的重视和支持，因而在这方面获得了那么大的成就。
    苏联党和政府深切了解戏剧教育是苏维埃戏剧事业整个过程中最重要的一环。一九二七年在苏联共产党中央宣传鼓动部领导下召开的戏剧工作会议的决议中明确地指出：如不认真地建立和开展戏剧教育，就不可能在戏剧工作中真正掌握了主要部门。一九一八年以卢那却尔斯基为首的苏维埃政府人民教育委员会下设的戏剧处公布了一个“工作大纲”，这个“工作大纲”在苏维埃戏剧和戏剧教育发展历史上成为重要的文献，在其中，不仅规定了为建设社会主义的新的戏剧的总任务，而且包括了和戏剧教育有关的全部原则问题，目前在苏联政府文化部下专设高等艺术教育事业管理局，由一个副部长兼任局长职务。这也说明了苏联党和政府对艺术教育（包括戏剧教育）事业的重视是始终如一的。
    三、在斗争中成长和发展
    十月革命以前，在十九世纪九十年代，俄罗斯戏剧教育曾经有一个短促的昌盛时期。当时阿·普·连斯基在小剧院主持话剧训练班，佛·纳·达维多夫在彼得堡办话剧训练班，而聂米洛维奇·丹钦柯在莫斯科音乐业余学校从事培养演员的工作。一八九八年第一批加入莫斯科艺术剧院的演员，就是在这个学校训练出来的。但他们当时是在极其艰难的条件下进行教学工作的：一方面他们必须在沙皇封建专制统治下争取生存，同时还得和皇家剧院管理处的反动保守思想以及戏剧界部分人们主张“打倒学校，打倒训练”的落后思想作坚决的斗争。
    俄罗斯先进的戏剧艺术的优秀代表们，如伊·阿·德米特里也夫斯基、墨·斯·史迁普金、伊·佛·萨马林、佛·纳·达维多夫、阿·普·连斯基等人，提出了许多先进的教学思想，他们认为戏剧教育的主要的任务不仅是演员的专业训练，使他们成为能掌握熟练的技术的专家，而是要演员通过自己的艺术在思想上揭示人的高尚品质来影响观众，这一个戏剧教育的中心问题——政治思想教育问题只有在苏维埃时代才能获得彻底解决。事实上十月革命后苏联戏剧学校以天才的演员、导演、教育家克·斯·史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的体系为基础来训练青年演员，并使艺术的训练和政治思想教育结合起来了。
    在苏维埃戏剧教育的初期，同在其他文化思想领域中一样，进行了两条战线的斗争。这就是说，一方面要反对盲目崇拜资产阶级文化并企图把它机械地搬运到苏维埃社会来的右的思想，另一方面也要反对反马克思主义的“无产阶级文化”派的理论家们所主张的干脆拒绝一切文化遗产的“左”的态度。对于沙皇时代遗留下来的旧的学校，列宁曾指出：“……要把旧时学校中坏的东西与对我们有益的东西区别开来，应该善于从旧学校中挑选出共产主义所必需的东西”。因此，对于老的戏剧教学干部需要进行思想改造，学校的领导成员与各种制度也亟待改革。这是苏维埃戏剧教育初期的一个艰巨的任务。
    在一九二一年后经济恢复时期，苏维埃戏剧的现实主义派和“左翼阵线”形式主义者之间为演员的作用问题进行了剧烈的斗争。形式主义者反对演员是独立的艺术家，否认演员用自己的创造来担负表现时代主题的巨大任务。他们武断地把演员的作用缩小为恭顺地执行导演的任务。但学院中著名教师阿·普·彼得罗夫斯基把亚历山德林斯基表演艺术中的优秀的现实主义传统带到教学中，并在他的领导下大批教师都起来反对伪装左倾的反动派，反对歪曲演员的创造性作用，为现实主义的戏剧艺术而斗争。
    一九三二年四月二十三日苏联共产党中央关于改组文学艺术团体，取消拉普（俄罗斯无产阶级作家协会）作了一个历史性的重要的决议，揭露了“左”的反动思想，促进了苏维埃文学艺术工作者的大团结。苏维埃戏剧教育也从此开始了新的阶段。史坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系在培养苏维埃演员方面最后取得了领导地位。一九三五年以耳·墨·列奥尼多夫、墨·墨·塔尔哈诺夫和佛·格·萨赫诺夫斯基为首的莫斯科艺术剧院的杰出工作者，也是史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的优秀的学生和战友，到国立卢那却尔斯基戏剧艺术学院来工作，为该院发展历史上开辟了新纪元。
    四、一个迫切而严重的任务
    为了建立和发展苏联各共和国各民族的戏剧艺术，首先必须为各民族准备各种戏剧干部。这是摆在苏维埃戏剧面前一个迫切而严重的任务。在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利后，一九一八——一九一九年时，苏维埃人民教育委员会戏剧处下设少数民族戏剧委员会。在它的工作条例中写道：“人民教育委员会戏剧处认为戏剧艺术在其实质上是最革命的和最迫切的，因而在其许多任务中为俄罗斯各民族的戏剧的产生和繁荣准备条件占着光荣的地位，这些民族的戏剧直到如今或者还处在狭小的范围内，或者根本没有戏剧。”
    因此，从一九三○年起苏联国立戏剧艺术学院不断地为苏联各共和国各民族培养了各种戏剧干部，甚至为有些民族共和国剧院训练整个剧团。目前，莫斯科国立戏剧艺术学院正在为哈萨克等五个民族，列宁格勒国立戏剧艺术学院正在为马里等六个民族的剧院培养整套的戏剧干部。在国立戏剧学院毕业生中有不少杰出的著名的民族艺术家。
    莫斯科和列宁格勒的两个国立戏剧学院表演系所设的每个民族班约有二十人左右的学员，他们都是从各该民族地区参加业余艺术活动的积极分子中选拔出来的最有才能的青年。经过五年的学习，排好几个不同类型的剧目，毕业后全班学员带着排好的剧目，回到原民族地区，或参加当地剧院，或成为新建剧院的骨干，他们就可把在学校排好的剧目公演。这种培养民族戏剧干部的方法是很好的，值得我们学习的。
    五、关键问题
    为了办好学校必须解决的两个关键问题：教材问题和师资问题，在苏联戏剧教育方面已获得了解决。莫斯科国立卢那却尔斯基戏剧艺术学院和列宁格勒国立奥斯特洛夫斯基戏剧艺术学院在解决这两个关键问题上所采取的途径有很好很多的经验值得我们学习的。这里我只能略述一二。
    莫斯科和列宁格勒两个戏剧学院的负责人都对我说，为了解决教材和师资问题必须建立和加强教研室的工作。教研室的科学研究工作任务首先就是要把教材编写好，也就是说，每门课程必须订出教学大纲，讲授提纲以至比较完善的课本。据我个人所知道的：上述两个学院在教材方面除各种课程都已有经过教研室讨论通过的教学大纲外，有两门课程的讲授提纲——表演技术和苏维埃俄罗斯戏剧史——已经苏联政府文化部审查批准，且已付印出版。另有西欧戏剧史一课，由该课研究室以斯·斯·莫古尔斯基为首的教师们编出了一大本西欧戏剧史选读第一卷，并已于去年付印出版。
    培养青年师资干部也是教研室的重要任务之一。教研室设研究生班，三年毕业后成绩优良者多半担任助教，或另行分配工作。但一个学院的师资问题不可能光靠教研室来解决，也不可能光靠上级主管部门调集多少个能胜任教学工作的戏剧干部来充当学院的专任教师，这主要依靠学院在党和政府的支持帮助下团结一批最优秀的戏剧家（名演员、导演、戏剧理论家和教育家）在自己的周围，吸收他们到学院里来兼课。莫斯科和列宁格勒两个苏联最主要的高等戏剧学校，就是这样解决师资问题的。许多艺术大师都是莫斯科艺术剧院杰出的教师。该院导演课在很长一个时期内都是由莫斯科艺术剧院杰出的导演，优秀的戏剧家佛·格·萨赫诺夫斯基领导的，他几乎把莫斯科各剧院的所有主要导演都吸收来参加学院导演课的教学工作。列宁格勒国立奥斯特洛夫斯基戏剧艺术学院在解决师资问题上和莫斯科的情况是同样的。
    吸收在剧院中担任实际工作的优秀的戏剧家来兼任教学工作，不仅克服了学院缺乏教学力量的困难，而且这些从事实际工作的戏剧家能把在戏剧艺术实践中获得的新的经验不断充实到教学内容中来，这样有助于教学质量的逐步提高，也有助于避免教学脱离实际的倾向。
    苏联在戏剧教育方面能够那么成功地采取上述途径解决了为办好学校必须解决的关键问题之一——师资问题，主要原因是由于以史坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米洛维奇·丹钦柯为首的苏维埃杰出的戏剧家们都以从事教学工作，训练青年干部作为自己对国家的戏剧事业应尽的责任。聂米洛维奇·丹钦柯曾说过：“我愿把我所具有的全部热情多多地放在戏剧教育方面”。这种热情也是每个十九世纪俄罗斯伟大的戏剧家如伊·阿·德米特里也夫斯基、墨·斯·史迁普金、伊·佛·萨马林、佛·纳·达维多夫、阿·普·连斯基等人以及每个苏维埃戏剧杰出的代表所具有的。正是这种热情过去培养了俄罗斯进步的戏剧艺术优良传统的继承者，而在十月革命后帮助了苏维埃戏剧教育，也就帮助了苏维埃整个戏剧事业获得光辉的成就和飞跃的发展。
