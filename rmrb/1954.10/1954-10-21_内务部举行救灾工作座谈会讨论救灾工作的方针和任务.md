    The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China held a symposium on disaster relief work from September 11th to 16th. A total of 49 representatives from relevant provinces, cities, and central departments participated in the symposium. The symposium focused on studying the current situation in disaster areas, exchanging experiences in disaster relief work, and discussing the principles and tasks of disaster relief work.
    The symposium first studied the situation in disaster-stricken areas across the country this year. Due to the rare floods in the Jianghuai region this year, cadres and people in disaster areas, as well as the broad masses of people across the country, united and fought hard to overcome the floods. Farmers in non-disaster areas vigorously increased grain production, and farmers in disaster areas worked hard to drain water, rescue seedlings, and engage in self-salvation through production, thus making up for some losses. However, the people in disaster areas are still facing serious difficulties, and they urgently need to rebuild their homes and make greater efforts to overcome difficulties in production and life.
    The meeting believed that although the work in flood-stricken areas had achieved great results in the past period, there must be no complacency. We must see the difficulties after the flood recedes. Neglecting these difficulties and relaxing disaster relief work would be a huge mistake. The meeting pointed out that cadres and the masses in disaster areas must establish firm confidence, and with the support of the people across the country, adhere to the principle of self-salvation through production, and work hard to overcome difficulties in production and life in order to overcome the disaster.
    Regarding production for disaster relief, the current focus should be on the resettlement of disaster victims returning to their hometowns. The meeting believes that work must be strengthened in the following aspects:
    First, all localities should continue to strengthen leadership over disaster area work, and according to local needs, organize production and disaster relief committees or other specialized institutions that regularly lead this work. Like during the flood season, concentrate efforts, go all out, and take restoring production and providing relief to disaster victims as the center of all work.
    Second, there must be a planned guarantee of material supply. In order to help the people in disaster areas overcome the disaster, the state has invested a large amount of relief funds, flood diversion compensation funds, embankment repair funds, agricultural loans, and sideline loans. Relevant departments should vigorously organize and plan the work of material supply so that the supplied materials are suitable for the actual needs of the disaster victims, and prevent disconnection and confusion.
    Third, give play to the role of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in overcoming the disaster through production. For example, rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to carry out sideline production, repair houses, repair embankments, carry out winter planting and spring planting, and rationally feed and use cattle and farm tools. Mutual aid and cooperation should be the center of the movement for production and disaster relief. At the same time, the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement should be improved a step further in disaster relief work.
    Fourth, actively develop sideline production. According to local conditions, organize various sideline productions such as fishing and mat weaving, and at the same time, find ways to solve the difficulties of sales and raw material supply for sideline products in many ways.
    Fifth, organize and promote production and disaster relief work through people's congresses at all levels. In the next few months, the meetings of people's congresses at all levels in disaster areas should mainly discuss production and disaster relief work. All disaster relief activities can be combined with the actual needs of the people through the meetings of the people's congresses; various disaster relief policies can be directly grasped by the people through the meetings of the people's congresses, and can exert infinite power.
    Sixth, effectively distribute and use relief grain and funds. All localities should clearly distinguish between disaster households with more difficulties, those with partial difficulties, and those who do not need government care, organize cadres to go to the countryside with funds, implement the mass line, overcome the tendency of "those who should be rescued are not rescued" or "those who should not be rescued are rescued instead," so that relief grain and funds can have their due effect.
    In addition, disaster areas should also seize the time to do a good job in embankment restoration and breach plugging projects before spring plowing; strengthen medical and health work in disaster areas; strengthen education for disaster victims to prevent blind outflow; practice thrift in overcoming the disaster; promote the enthusiasm of the people and cadres at all levels in disaster areas through commendation of models and inspection of work; and strengthen public security work to prevent sabotage by bad elements and counter-revolutionaries.

### 内务部举行救灾工作座谈会讨论救灾工作的方针和任务

    内务部举行救灾工作座谈会讨论救灾工作的方针和任务
    中华人民共和国内务部自九月十一日到十六日举行救灾工作座谈会。各有关省、市和中央各有关部门的代表共四十九人，参加了这次座谈会。座谈会着重研究了目前灾区的情况，交流了救灾工作的经验，讨论了救灾工作的方针和任务。
    座谈会首先研究了今年全国受灾地区的情况。由于今年江淮等地区出现了历史上少有的洪水。受灾地区的干部和人民以及全国广大人民团结一致奋力战胜洪水。非灾区的农民大力增产粮食，灾区农民努力排除积水，抢救禾苗，生产自救，因而弥补了一些损失。但目前灾区人民仍面临着严重的困难，他们急需重整家园，并要用更大的努力来克服生产和生活上的困难。
    会议认为，虽然水灾地区过去一段工作取得了巨大的成绩，但决不能自满，必须看到洪水退后的困难，忽视这些困难而放松救灾工作，那就会犯极大的错误。会议指出，灾区干部和群众必须树立坚定的信心，在全国人民的支援下，坚持生产自救的方针，努力克服生产和生活上的困难，才能战胜灾荒。
    关于生产救灾工作，目前主要应抓紧对回乡灾民的安置。会议认为必须从以下几方面加强工作：
    第一、各地应继续加强对灾区工作的领导，根据当地需要，组织生产救灾委员会或其他经常领导这一工作的专门机构，和防汛时期一样，集中力量，全力以赴，以恢复生产、救济灾民作为一切工作的中心。
    第二、要有计划地保障物资供应。为帮助灾区人民战胜灾荒，国家已投下大量的救济款、分洪补偿款、修复堤垸款、农业贷款和副业贷款等，有关部门应大力组织和筹划物资供应的工作，使供应的物资和灾民的实际需要相适合，防止发生脱节和混乱的现象。
    第三、发挥互助合作组织在生产渡荒中的作用。如依靠互助合作组织进行副业生产，修复房屋，修复堤垸，进行冬种、春种，合理喂养和使用耕牛、农具等。互助合作应是生产救灾运动的中心，同时应使农村的互助合作运动在救灾工作中提高一步。
    第四、积极开展副业生产。根据各地条件，因地制宜的组织捕鱼、编席等各种副业生产，同时多方面设法解决副业产品的销路和原料供应的困难。
    第五、通过各级人民代表大会组织和推动生产救灾工作。今后几个月内，灾区的各级人民代表大会会议主要应讨论生产救灾工作。救灾的一切活动，通过人民代表大会会议就能和人民的实际需要结合在一起；救灾的各项政策，通过人民代表大会会议为人民直接掌握，就能发挥无限力量。
    第六、有效地发放，使用救济粮款。各地应当把困难多的、有部分困难的和不需要政府照顾的灾户区分清楚，组织干部力量，随款下乡，贯彻群众路线，克服“应救不救”或者“不应救的反而救了”的偏向，使救济粮款发生应有的效力。
    此外，灾区还要抓紧在春耕前做好复堤堵口工程；加强灾区医疗卫生工作；加强对灾民的教育，防止盲目外流；实行节约渡荒；通过表扬模范、检查工作等，发扬灾区人民和各级干部的积极性；加强治安工作，防止坏分子和反革命分子的破坏。
