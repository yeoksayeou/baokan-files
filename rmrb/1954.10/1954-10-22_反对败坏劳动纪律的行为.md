　　Our working class, after overthrowing the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and abolishing the bloody discipline in the old enterprises aimed at oppressing and exploiting workers, began to establish conscious labor discipline. The vast majority of employees have been able to actively work, carry out competitions, and consciously maintain labor discipline with a sense of ownership, thereby promoting the rapid development of the country's economic construction and increasing the welfare of the working class and the people of the whole country. The high level of consciousness and labor enthusiasm and creativity demonstrated by our working class in the country's construction work over the past few years fully proves that it deserves to be the leading class and backbone force of our country.
    However, due to the continuous increase of new members in recent years and the insufficient labor discipline education in enterprises, there are also phenomena of absenteeism, sluggish work, disobedience to command and dispatch, and violation of operating procedures among enterprise employees, which have caused and continue to cause losses to the country's economic construction. Among these employees who violate labor discipline, there is also a small number of people who have been infected with the bad habits of selfishness, looseness, and licentiousness from the old society. They have a low level of class consciousness, are unwilling to be loyal to social labor, consistently disrupt internal labor discipline in enterprises, and repeatedly fail to mend their ways despite repeated admonition. Although such people are only a tiny minority in enterprises, they often bring great disasters to production. Some recent cases of serious violations of labor discipline handled in Jiangsu and other places are some examples of this. Some of these people consistently fail to comply with operating procedures and are extremely irresponsible in their work, resulting in fires that force the entire factory to stop production; others deliberately fail to operate according to procedures, resulting in a large number of product rework and even serious accidents such as machine explosions; others deliberately fail to construct according to blueprints, resulting in repeated rework and waste in basic construction projects, affecting the quality of the projects; and some are even long-term absentees, loafers, swindlers, and do all kinds of evil. These bad elements not only cause economic losses to the country, but also play a corrosive and divisive role on the surrounding masses in terms of ideology, affecting the unity and progress of the workers, and causing serious adverse consequences politically. It is entirely appropriate to impose serious sanctions on them in accordance with the law.
    In our country, labor is a glorious, brave, and noble thing, and labor discipline is built on the foundation of the workers' consciousness. The state mainly adopts the policy of encouragement and education to consolidate labor discipline, that is, it strives to improve the working conditions and material and cultural life of employees, gives the greatest care to workers' labor in all aspects, encourages employees' labor enthusiasm and creativity, and gives spiritual and material rewards to workers with excellent performance. At the same time, it strengthens communist education for workers in enterprises, carries out criticism and self-criticism among the workers, and enables them to gradually realize the consistency of the interests of the entire people, the interests of the country, and individual interests, and consciously maintain labor discipline. This is the fundamental method for consolidating labor discipline. And the greater purpose of our implementation of disciplinary sanctions is also for education, that is, to educate him not to commit it again next time, and to educate others not to violate labor discipline.
    However, we must also see that today the class relations in our society are still very complicated, and the ideological consciousness of non-working classes continues to influence the vast number of employees. A large number of small producers and components of other classes are constantly pouring into the ranks of the working class, bringing various ideas and styles that are incompatible with collective discipline. This complex situation shows that consolidating labor discipline is by no means a simple matter, but an intense and complex struggle. The essence of this struggle is to maintain the purity of the working class, eliminate the erosion of various non-working class ideologies, and defend the cause of the working class. To ensure the victory of this struggle, strict labor discipline and all necessary production systems must be established internally. Only by combining ideological education with strict disciplinary life, only by uniting the majority of the masses and carrying out unremitting struggle against various behaviors that violate labor discipline, can we establish truly solid labor discipline within enterprises, make the working class a highly conscious and organized team, and be able to shoulder the task of the country's socialist industrialization and advance victoriously.
    In the labor practice of the past few years, the majority of our employees have increasingly realized the importance of labor discipline in ensuring production, and therefore can consciously abide by labor discipline and fight against phenomena that undermine discipline. However, some of our employees still have some confused ideas on the issue of labor discipline. They do not understand the necessity of labor discipline, do not know that abiding by labor discipline and abiding by public order are the sacred obligations of citizens of New China and one of the hallmarks of socialist new morality, and are the most important weapons for the working class to lead the people of the whole country in building socialism. They think that since they have become the masters of the enterprise today, they can "act freely" without being constrained by discipline. Therefore, they regard any discipline and labor rules as unnecessary, regard violations of labor discipline as "minor matters," and do not take a serious attitude to oppose the behavior of others that undermine labor discipline. Obviously, these views are all wrong. We should explain to the workers, especially to those new workers, that after liberation, with the fundamental change in the status of the working class, the foundation of labor discipline has been completely different. Today, our labor discipline is built on the basis of the complete consistency of national interests and individual interests. Labor discipline is no longer a tool for oppressing and exploiting workers, but has become a powerful weapon for maintaining production, correctly guiding employees in production activities, and organizing and promoting the labor enthusiasm of employees. If we treat our own enterprises of the working class with absenteeism, sluggish work, and disobedience to command and dispatch, then it becomes a destructive act against the collective cause of the working class. This behavior should be opposed by all employees.
    Some leading cadres of our departments and enterprises also have a wrong concept on the issue of labor discipline. They believe that strictly enforcing discipline is "capitalist management thought," is "warlord style" and "commandism," and therefore consciously or unconsciously adopt a compromising attitude, turning a blind eye to phenomena that undermine labor discipline or dare not resolutely stop it, and fail to resolutely rely on and mobilize the masses to fight against behaviors that undermine labor discipline, so as to form moral resistance from the broad masses. Some workers have been in the factory for several years without working properly, and the leadership does not give disciplinary action. Some trade union and Communist Youth League work cadres in some enterprises, when talking about the badness of labor discipline, one-sidedly accuse the shortcomings of the enterprise's labor protection and welfare work, criticize bureaucracy in administration, but dare not criticize the backward demands and behaviors that violate labor discipline of a few employees in a positive way, and even defend them. They mistakenly believe that this is "protecting the interests of the working class" and "standing firm on the position of the working class." The result is precisely to encourage the backward tendencies among the workers, so that bad people and bad deeds are not criticized, and labor discipline is even more lax. In fact, this is the most serious damage to the interests of the working class and a betrayal of the position of the working class. There is no doubt that all the working cadres of our enterprises should cherish and care for the employees very much. Precisely because we cherish them, we must constantly help them correct their shortcomings, improve their class consciousness, and resolutely fight against the few people and things that endanger the common interests of the employees. This is the correct attitude to maintain the interests of the working class, and it can also win the sincere support of the working class.
    There is also such a situation in enterprises now: Although some people admit that legal sanctions are necessary, they believe that they are only used to deal with counter-revolutionaries, or to deal with extremely individual bad elements with extremely bad character. As for those who are responsible for serious accidents, no matter how much damage they have caused to the country, they will no longer be given legal sanctions, but only euphemistically advised and criticized, and the person will review and review it. This approach is also wrong. Counter-revolutionaries and bad elements with extremely bad character who undermine our construction cause must of course be resolutely sanctioned in accordance with the law, but those who are responsible for serious accidents, as long as it is not due to irresistible objective reasons, but due to violations of labor discipline, thus causing the country to suffer undue serious losses, he also constitutes a criminal act of harming state property, and he must bear the responsibility for causing this loss and be subject to the due punishment of state law. Therefore, whoever undermines labor discipline, causing significant losses to the interests of the state and the people, regardless of his class, how high his position is, or how important his work is, must be criticized, disciplined, or punished. There can be no ambiguity about this. Serious liability accidents are now constantly occurring in enterprises, and some departments are even becoming more and more frequent, causing great economic losses to the country. If we do not adopt this resolute attitude, labor discipline will not be consolidated, and the disasters of serious accidents will never be stopped.
    Of course, establishing strict internal discipline does not mean that we can simply do it. Some of our comrades have shown an impatient mood on the issue of labor discipline, trying to solve it completely in a movement. This is a wrong illusion. We must fully realize that consolidating labor discipline is a long-term process of communist education, and it is by no means something that can be achieved overnight. Lenin once said: "To create new labor discipline, to create new forms of social connection between people, to create new forms and methods of attracting people to work - this requires years, decades of work." ("From the Destruction of the Old System to the Creation of a New System") We must make plans for long-term efforts and constantly seek improvement in the continuous improvement of the entire work of the enterprise. The current situation of lax labor discipline in enterprises is inseparable from many shortcomings in the current ideological work and administrative management work in enterprises. For example, labor discipline education in many enterprises is in a state of stagnation, political work is not active, criticism and self-criticism are not carried out, no attention is paid to the life and welfare of employees, endless meetings and various unnecessary activities cause excessive fatigue for employees, new workers are hastily used without basic technical and political training, and no attention is paid to the work of employees' families, etc. Therefore, to consolidate labor discipline, we must constantly improve work and create conditions from all aspects of the enterprise.
    In the struggle to maintain internal labor discipline, leading cadres and Communist Party members at all levels of the enterprise have a major responsibility. They should become models of abiding by and implementing labor discipline. However, many leading cadres of our enterprises, especially grassroots cadres and party members, often fail to strictly abide by labor discipline. In order to change this situation, all leading cadres and Communist Party members in the enterprise should conscientiously study operating procedures and safety regulations, strictly abide by labor discipline issues, and learn to master various necessary technical knowledge. If leading cadres and Communist Party members violate labor discipline, they should be dealt with seriously according to the circumstances. The Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates that "exemplary compliance with the discipline of the revolutionary government and revolutionary organizations, proficiency in one's own business, and playing an exemplary role in various revolutionary undertakings" is one of the sacred obligations of every Communist Party member. If leading cadres and Communist Party members at all levels establish the concept of abiding by the law and can practice what they preach, then it will not be very difficult to establish good labor discipline in the entire enterprise.

### 反对败坏劳动纪律的行为

    反对败坏劳动纪律的行为
    我国工人阶级在推翻了国民党的反动统治，废除了旧企业中以压迫和剥削工人为目的的血腥纪律以后，就开始建立了自觉的劳动纪律，绝大多数职工都能够以主人翁的态度，积极劳动，开展竞赛，自觉地维护劳动纪律，因而推动了国家经济建设事业的迅速发展，增进了工人阶级和全国人民的福利。我国工人阶级在几年来国家建设工作中所表现的这种高度觉悟和劳动积极性创造性，充分证明了它不愧是我们国家的领导阶级和中坚力量。
    但是，由于几年来新成员的不断增加，以及企业劳动纪律教育不够等原因，企业职工中也存在着旷工、怠工、不服从指挥调度、不遵守操作规程等违反劳动纪律的现象，使国家经济建设事业遭受了并继续遭受着损失。在这些违反劳动纪律的职工中，还有一小部分人，他们沾染了比较浓厚的旧社会自私自利散漫放荡的恶习，阶级觉悟不高，不愿忠诚地对待社会劳动，一贯破坏企业内部劳动纪律，而且屡教不改。这种人在企业中虽然只是极少数，但是他们往往给生产带来很大的灾害。最近江苏等地处理的一些严重违反劳动纪律的事件，就是其中的一些例子。这些人有的是一贯不遵守操作规程，工作极不负责，结果酿成火灾，全厂被迫停止生产；有的是故意不按照规程操作，结果使大量产品返工，甚至造成机器爆炸的严重事故；有的是故意不按照图纸施工，结果造成基本建设工程多次的返工浪费，影响工程质量；有的更是长期的旷工、怠工，招摇撞骗，胡作非为。这些害群之马，不但给国家造成经济上的损失，而且对周围群众在思想上起着腐蚀分化的作用，影响工人群众的团结和进步，造成政治上严重的不良后果。对他们依法进行严肃的处理，是完全应该的。
    在我们的国家里，劳动是光荣、勇敢、高尚的事情，劳动纪律是建筑在劳动者自觉的基础之上的。国家对于巩固劳动纪律，主要是采取鼓励和教育的方针，即努力改善职工的劳动条件和物质文化生活，对于工人的劳动从各方面给予最大的关怀，鼓励职工的劳动积极性和创造性，对成绩优良的工作者给予精神和物质的奖励。同时，在企业中加强对工人的共产主义教育，开展工人群众中的批评和自我批评，使他们逐渐认识到全体人民的利益、国家利益和个人利益的一致性，自觉地来维护劳动纪律。这是巩固劳动纪律的根本方法。而我们实行纪律制裁，其更大的目的也是为了教育，这就是教育他下次不要再犯，教育别人不要违反劳动纪律。
    但是我们也必须看到，今天我国社会阶级关系还很复杂，非工人阶级的思想意识还不断影响着广大职工，大量小生产者和其他阶级的成份源源地涌入工人阶级的队伍，带来了各种与集体纪律不相容的思想和作风。这种复杂的情况说明，巩固劳动纪律绝不是一件简易的事，而是一场激烈复杂的斗争。这个斗争实质上就是为了保持工人阶级内部的纯洁性，清除各种非工人阶级思想侵蚀，保卫工人阶级事业的斗争。要保证这个斗争的胜利，必须在内部建立起严格的劳动纪律和一切必要的生产制度。只有把思想教育和严格的纪律生活结合起来，只有团结大多数群众和各种违反劳动纪律的行为进行坚持不懈的斗争，才能在企业内部建立起真正巩固的劳动纪律，使工人阶级成为一支具有高度觉悟性与组织性的队伍，才能够把国家的社会主义工业化的任务担当起来，并胜利地前进。
    我们大多数职工在几年来的劳动实践中，已日益认识到劳动纪律对于保证生产的重要性，因而都能自觉地遵守劳动纪律，并与败坏纪律的现象进行斗争。但是，我们有些职工同志，在劳动纪律问题上还存在着一些混乱的思想。他们不了解劳动纪律的必要性，不知道遵守劳动纪律，遵守公共秩序，乃是新中国公民的神圣义务和社会主义新道德的标志之一，乃是工人阶级领导全国人民建设社会主义的最重要的武器，他们以为今天既然成了企业的主人，就可以不受纪律约束而“自由行动”。因此把任何纪律和劳动规则都看成不必要的，把违反劳动纪律的行为看成“小事情”，对别人败坏劳动纪律的行为也就不采取严肃态度加以反对。显然地，这些看法都是错误的。我们应该向工人们，特别是向那些新工人们说明：解放后随着工人阶级地位的根本改变，劳动纪律的基础已完全不同了，今天我们的劳动纪律是建筑在国家利益与个人利益完全一致的基础上的，劳动纪律不再是压迫、剥削工人的工具，而成了维护生产事业、正确地指导职工进行生产活动、组织和发扬职工劳动积极性的一个有力武器。如果以旷工、怠工和不服从指挥调度等行为来对待工人阶级自己的企业，那就成为对工人阶级集体事业的破坏行为了。这种行为是全体职工都应当反对的。
    我们有些部门和企业的领导干部，在劳动纪律问题上也存在着一种错误的观念，他们认为严格地执行纪律，就是“资本主义管理思想”，就是“军阀作风”和“命令主义”，因而就自觉或不自觉地采取了迁就姑息态度，对破坏劳动纪律的现象熟视无睹或不敢坚决制止，不能坚决地依靠和发动群众，向败坏劳动纪律的行为进行斗争，以形成广大群众道德上的抵制。有的工人进厂几年从不好好工作，领导上也不给予纪律处分。有些企业的工会和青年团工作干部，谈到劳动纪律不好，就片面地指责企业劳保福利工作的缺点，批评行政上官僚主义，而对少数职工的落后要求和违反劳动纪律的行为，却不敢正面的进行批评，甚至还为他们辩护。他们错误地以为这样就是“保护了工人阶级的利益”，“站稳了工人阶级的立场”。其结果恰恰是助长了工人中的落后倾向，使坏人坏事受不到指责，劳动纪律更加松懈。实际上这正是最严重地损害了工人阶级的利益，背弃了工人阶级的立场。毫无疑问，我们任何企业的工作干部都应当十分爱护和关怀职工，正因为爱护他们，我们才必须不断地帮助他们纠正缺点，提高阶级觉悟，并对少数危害职工共同利益的人和事进行坚决斗争，这才是维护工人阶级利益的正确态度，也才能取得工人阶级的真诚拥护。
    企业中现在还有这样一种情形：有些人虽然承认法律制裁是必须的，但认为只是用以对付反革命分子，或者用以处理极个别的品质极端恶劣的坏分子，至于严重的事故责任者，不管他给予国家的损害多大，就不再给予法律制裁，而只是委婉地劝告批评一番，本人检讨检讨就算了。这种做法也是不对的。破坏我们建设事业的反革命分子和品质极其恶劣的坏分子，当然是必须依法坚决制裁的，但是严重事故的责任者，只要他不是由于不可抗拒的客观原因，而是由于违反了劳动纪律，因而使国家遭受到了不应有的严重损失，他也就构成了损害国家财产的犯罪行为，他就必须承担造成这个损失的责任，受到国家法律的应有处分。因此，谁要是破坏了劳动纪律，使国家和人民的利益遭受了重大损失，不论他是那一个阶级，他的职位有多么高，工作有多么重要，都必须受到批评、惩戒或处罚，这是丝毫也不能含糊的。严重的责任事故现在在企业中不断发生，有的部门甚至越来越频繁，给国家在经济上造成了极大损失，我们如果不采取这种坚决态度，劳动纪律将不可能得到巩固，严重事故的灾难将永远无法遏止。
    当然，建立严格的内部纪律，决不是说我们就可以简单从事了。我们有些同志对劳动纪律问题表现了一种急躁情绪，企图在一个运动里就彻底解决。这是一种错误的幻想。我们必须充分认识巩固劳动纪律是长期的共产主义教育的过程，决非一朝一夕之功。列宁曾说：“创立新的劳动纪律，创立人与人之间新的社会联系形式，创立吸引人们从事劳动的新形式和新方法，——这是需要有多年的、几十年的工作。”（“从破坏历来的旧制度到创造新制度”）我们必须作长期努力的打算，在企业整个工作的不断改进中来不断地求得改进。今天企业中劳动纪律松弛的情况，和目前企业中思想工作和行政管理工作上许多缺点是不可分的。如许多企业劳动纪律教育处于停滞状态，政治工作不活跃，批评和自我批评不开展，不注意职工的生活福利，无休止的会议和各种不必要的活动造成职工的过度疲劳，不对新工人进行技术和政治的基本训练就匆忙加以使用，不注意职工家属工作，等等。因此要巩固劳动纪律，必须经常地从企业的各个方面来改进工作，创造条件。
    在维护内部劳动纪律的斗争中，企业各级领导干部和共产党员负有重大的责任，他们应当成为遵守和执行劳动纪律的模范。我们有不少企业领导干部，特别是基层干部和党员，却往往不能严格遵守劳动纪律。为了改变这种情况，企业中一切领导干部和共产党员，应当认真钻研操作规程和保安规程，严格遵守劳动纪律问题，学习掌握各种必要的技术知识。如果领导干部和共产党员违反了劳动纪律，更要分别情况，严肃处理。中国共产党党章中曾规定，“模范地遵守革命政府和革命组织的纪律，精通自己的业务，在各种革命事业中起模范作用”，是每一个共产党员的神圣义务之一。如果各级领导干部和共产党员都确立了守法的观念，并能身体力行，那么建立整个企业良好的劳动纪律就不会是很困难的了。
