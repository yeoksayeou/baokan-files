Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 28th: The grain unified purchase work in Sichuan Province has fully unfolded. As of early October, the province had completed 47% of its purchase plan. In a few villages where the unified purchase work started earlier, farmers have already begun delivering grain to the warehouses.

This year, Sichuan Province's grain unified purchase task is larger and the time is tighter than last year. Therefore, the Party Committees at all levels in Sichuan Province began training cadres as early as August. Through expanded meetings of cadres at the levels of special districts, counties, districts, and townships, they studied the policy of unified purchase and sales. According to incomplete statistics, in the seven special districts of Neijiang, Luzhou, etc., there were more than 430,000 cadres, Party members, League members, and activists in rural areas who received training. Now, cadres in various places have mostly gone deep into the villages to conduct propaganda and education among the masses, and to evaluate the unified purchase tasks and the households eligible for unified sales. Grain departments at all levels also started preparing for the purchase of grain and the receiving of grain into warehouses long ago. More than 16,000 temporary assistants for purchase, hired by the Grain Bureau of the Provincial People's Government in various places, have arrived in the rural areas and at various grain purchasing stations. The distribution of grain purchasing stations throughout the province has been changed and adjusted according to farmers' habits, and some areas have also added purchasing stations to facilitate farmers' grain sales and deliveries. Recently, the Grain Bureau of the Provincial People's Government has also dispatched a group of cadres to grain purchasing stations in Wenjiang, Mianyang and other places to assist in inspecting grain quality. Grain warehouses throughout the province have also been basically prepared, and cleaning and disinfection are currently underway in various places.

Many farmers in Sichuan Province are very enthusiastic about selling surplus grain this year because they have achieved bumper harvests for many years in a row. In many grain purchasing stations in the Jiangjin Special District, crowds of people selling grain throng the entrances every day. Last year, the most grain purchased in this special district in a single day did not exceed three million jin, but this year it once purchased nine million jin in a single day. In the first ten days of the unified purchase work in Beimiao Township, Jiange County, the amount of grain that farmers voluntarily reported to sell already exceeded the original purchase plan by more than 22,000 jin. After the autumn harvest, the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longchang County held a patriotic grain sales meeting. The members used their exemplary actions to encourage the farmers in the surrounding villages to voluntarily report selling more than 90,000 jin of grain. On the morning of National Day, more than 700 members of the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative and farmers from the surrounding villages, carrying red flags reading "Support Economic Construction, Support People in Disaster Areas, and Support the Liberation of Taiwan," together sent the surplus grain they sold to the national warehouse.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 28th: The number of households with surplus grain in rural Sichuan Province after the bumper harvest has increased compared to last year. According to surveys in typical villages in various places, generally, the surplus grain households in grain-producing areas can reach 70% to 80% of the total number of agricultural households. In Pixian County on the western Sichuan plain, the number of newly emerged surplus grain households this autumn is about 5,000 or more, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. In Minzhu Township, Muchuan County, only 378 households sold surplus grain last year, but this year the number of households selling surplus grain has increased to 580.

The largest increase in surplus grain households is in agricultural production cooperatives. Among the 34 members of the Dengta Agricultural Production Cooperative in Naxi County, four households lacked grain last year and four households barely had enough to eat. This year, the entire cooperative increased its rice production by 16,600 jin, and every household has surplus grain. The entire cooperative decided to sell more than double the amount of grain to the state compared to last year. The more than 600 agricultural production cooperatives newly established throughout the province during this year's spring plowing generally increased production, and most cooperatives have surplus grain in every household. The first agricultural production cooperative in Xipu Township, Pixian County, sold 230,000 jin of rice to the state after the autumn harvest.

Many poor peasants also have surplus grain this year. In Beiyan Township, Fuling County, only 73 poor peasant households sold grain last year, but this year the number has increased to 345; the grain sold to the state by poor peasants has risen from 12% to 36% of the total amount of grain sold in the township. Lei Shaoqing, a 54-year-old farmer in Fuxing Township, Jiajiang County, lacked food grain every year before liberation, but after liberation, production increased and he gradually achieved self-sufficiency. Last winter, he was very sad when many farmers sold grain to the state, and he made up his mind to do a good job of farming. This year, his crops increased greatly, and after paying agricultural tax and providing food for his family, he still has a surplus of 1,320 jin of grain. Lei Shaoqing wrote in the Sichuan Peasant Newspaper: I never sold a single grain in the past, but this year I also have surplus grain to sell to the state!

    四川省粮食统购工作全面展开
    【新华社成都二十八日电】四川省粮食统购工作已全面展开。到十月上旬止，全省已完成收购计划百分之四十七。少数统购工作进行较早的乡村，农民已开始送粮入库。
    今年四川省粮食统购任务比去年大，时间紧，因此，中共四川省各级党委早在八月份就开始训练干部，通过专区、县、区、乡各级干部扩大会议，学习统购统销的政策。据不完全统计，内江、泸州等七个专区受过训练的干部和农村中的党员、团员、积极分子就有四十三万多人。现在各地的干部大都已深入到村，向群众进行宣传教育，评议统购任务和统销户。各级粮食部门也早就着手进行收购粮食和接收粮食入库的准备工作。省人民政府粮食厅在各地聘请的一万六千多个临时协助收购的工作人员，已到达农村和各粮食收购站。全省粮食收购站的分布根据农民的习惯作了变动和调整，部分地区还增设了收购站，以便利农民售粮、缴粮。最近，省人民政府粮食厅又派出了一批干部到温江、绵阳等地粮食收购站协助检验粮食质量。全省粮食仓库也已基本准备好，现在各地正在进行清扫和消毒。
    四川省不少农民因为连年获得丰收，今年出售余粮的热情很高。江津专区很多粮食收购站的门前每天都拥挤着售粮的人群。去年这个专区收购粮食最多的一天没有超过三百万斤，今年在一天内曾收购九百万斤。剑阁县北庙乡在统购工作开始的头十天，农民自报的卖粮数量就已超过原订收购计划二万二千多斤。隆昌县红旗农业生产合作社在秋收后召开了爱国售粮大会，社员们用自己的模范行动鼓舞了周围各村农民自报卖粮九万多斤。国庆节早上，红旗农业生产合作社的社员和周围各村农民七百多人，打着“支援经济建设、支援灾区人民、支援解放台湾”的红旗，一道把出售的余粮送进了国家仓库。
    【新华社成都二十八日电】丰收后的四川省农村余粮户比去年增多。据各地典型乡村调查：一般粮食产区今年的余粮户可达当地农业总户数的百分之七十到八十。川西平原上的郫县，今年秋后新出现的余粮户约在五千户以上，比去年余粮户增加百分之十以上。沐川县民主乡去年只有三百七十八户出卖余粮，今年出卖余粮的就增加到五百八十户。
    余粮户增加最多的是农业生产合作社。纳谿县灯塔农业生产合作社三十四户社员中，去年有四户缺粮，四户仅仅够吃，今年全社增产了稻谷一万六千六百斤，家家有余粮。全社决定卖给国家的粮食比去年增加一倍多。全省今年春耕时新建立的六百多个农业生产合作社普遍增产，大部分社都户户有余粮。郫县犀浦乡第一农业生产合作社秋后卖给国家的稻谷就有二十三万斤。
    今年很多贫农也有了余粮。涪陵县北雁乡去年卖粮的贫农只有七十三户，今年就增加到三百四十五户；贫农卖给国家的粮食，由去年占全乡卖粮总数的百分之十二上升到百分之三十六。夹江县复兴乡五十四岁的农民雷少清，在解放前每年都缺口粮，解放后生产提高，逐步做到自给。去年冬天很多农民卖粮食给国家，他很难过，打定主意要做好庄稼。今年他的庄稼增产很大，除去缴农业税和全家食用外，还有余粮一千三百二十斤。雷少清在四川农民报上写道：我过去没卖过一颗粮，今年也有余粮卖给国家了！
