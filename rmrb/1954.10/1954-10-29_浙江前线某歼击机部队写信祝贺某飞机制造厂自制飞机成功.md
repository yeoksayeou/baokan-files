Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 28th: Pilots and ground crew of a fighter jet unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force on the Zhejiang front have recently written letters to a certain aircraft factory in our country, warmly congratulating the workers, designers, and factory leaders who personally manufactured the first batch of aircraft in our country.

This fighter jet unit shot down nine Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes and damaged three Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes in the skies over the Zhejiang front for more than three months from March 18th to July 6th this year. The pilots and ground crew were extremely excited to hear the news of the successful manufacturing of aircraft in our country. Pilot Jiang Kai, who shot down an enemy plane, said in a congratulatory letter to all workers and designers of the aircraft factory: "The news of the successful manufacturing of aircraft in our country has brought us great joy. This is another victory in the process of our country's socialist industrialization and national defense modernization. I express my warm congratulations for your hard work." Pilots Bao Ximing and Wang Wanlin, the flight squadron leader, who each shot down an enemy plane, said in their letters: "In the second year of the motherland's first five-year construction plan, you have successfully produced the first batch of aircraft in our country. This is something that has never happened in the history of our country, and it is also a major event that the people of the motherland and our air force fighters have been looking forward to for a long time. We would like to express our heartfelt congratulations and cordial greetings to you. Your hard work and brilliant achievements have given us great encouragement. We will definitely learn from your spirit of selfless labor and overcoming difficulties, and redouble our skills to fight for the liberation of Taiwan."

Many ground service personnel of this fighter jet unit also wrote letters to the workers of the aircraft factory. The entire staff of a certain aircraft service team, which has been awarded two collective third-class merits and one collective second-class merit, said in their letter: "Your labor achievements have powerfully supported the struggle to liberate Taiwan and inspired our fighting will. Under the correct leadership of the higher authorities, our aircraft service team has ensured hundreds of safe flights and landings of aircraft. The pilot of the aircraft maintained by our team has shot down two Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes and damaged one Chiang Kai-shek bandit plane in recent months. In the future, we will learn from your working spirit, maintain the aircraft more carefully, strive to create greater honor, and shoot down more Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes." Another aircraft service team that won a collective second-class merit also expressed in a congratulatory letter that they would learn from the working spirit of the aircraft factory personnel, improve work efficiency, ensure flight safety, and strive to defend the motherland's airspace and liberate Taiwan.

    这一支歼击机部队，从今年三月十八日到七月六日三个多月中，曾在浙江前线上空击落蒋贼飞机九架、击伤蒋贼飞机三架。飞行员和地勤人员们听到我国自制飞机成功的消息后，都感到极大的兴奋。曾击落敌机一架的飞行员姜恺在给飞机制造厂全体工人和设计师的祝贺信上说：“我国自制飞机成功的消息，给我们带来了极大的喜悦，这是我国社会主义工业化和国防现代化过程中的又一个胜利。我对你们的辛勤劳动表示热烈的祝贺。”各击落敌机一架的飞行员保锡明、飞行大队长王万林在信上说：“在祖国第一个五年建设计划的第二年里，你们就胜利地生产出了我国的第一批飞机，这是我国有史以来所不曾有过的事情，也是祖国人民和我们空军战士们久所盼望的一件大事，我们特向你们表示衷心的祝贺和亲切的慰问。你们的辛勤劳动和所取得的光辉成就，给了我们莫大的鼓舞。我们一定学习你们忘我劳动和克服困难的精神，百倍地提高本领，为解放台湾而奋斗。”
    这支歼击机部队的许多地面勤务人员也给飞机制造厂的工人写了信。曾荣立两次集体三等功、一次集体二等功的某飞机勤务组的全体人员在信上说：“你们的劳动成果有力地支持了解放台湾的斗争，鼓舞了我们的战斗意志。我们这个飞机勤务组在上级正确领导下，已保证了飞机数百次安全飞行和起落。我们小组维护的飞机的飞行员在最近几个月中曾击落蒋贼飞机两架、击伤蒋贼飞机一架。今后，我们要学习你们的工作精神，更细致地维护飞机，争取创造更大的荣誉，击落更多的蒋贼飞机。”另一个荣立集体二等功的飞机勤务组在祝贺信中，也表示要学习飞机制造厂人员的工作精神，提高工作效率，确保飞行安全，为保卫祖国领空和解放台湾而奋斗。
