    The Flower of Happiness
    —On the Birth of a Uyghur Baby
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Han Wenhui, Ai Haiti
    On the eve of the opening of the Hotan Silk Reeling and Weaving Factory in Xinjiang, we visited Nur Nisha Xilifu, a Uyghur silk reeling worker who had returned from studying at the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Factory in Jiangsu Province. She has been busy recently asking people to help her write a letter to all the staff of the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Factory to thank them for saving her daughter, Reli Gu, who was born in Suzhou. When we entered Nur Nisha Xilifu's dormitory, Reli Gu, this little life who had made a long journey on the soil of the motherland, was lying comfortably in her cradle. She is already more than nine months old, wearing a small red dress and a pink velvet coat given by the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Factory; wearing small floral shoes on her feet, a pair of bright big eyes under her dark eyebrows are constantly turning. The birth of Reli Gu is a touching story.
    Nur Nisha Xilifu is a rural woman from Yecheng County in southern Xinjiang. Last summer, when the Hotan Silk Reeling and Weaving Factory recruited workers to study in Suzhou, she patiently persuaded her father and husband, and left her hometown with more than sixty girls of various ethnic groups to study in Suzhou, more than 10,000 miles away. Soon, Nur Nisha Xilifu felt more and more uncomfortable, feeling weak all day long and her vision would darken when standing in the workshop. After a doctor's examination, it was discovered that she was pregnant. Nur Nisha Xilifu was very worried: Would she be able to persist and study with everyone? Thinking of the sincere and patient way the silk factory workers taught her technology, she made up her mind to learn the technology. Her teachers and the Han workers in the workshop advised her to rest many times, but she refused. By the beginning of November, she had learned to master fifteen magnetic eyes. But due to overwork, the baby in her womb was born before it was even seven months old.
    The little girl was only two and a half pounds when she was born, as big as a kitten, and could not drink milk three days later. The silk factory's clinic tried various methods to rescue her, but they were still ineffective. The leaders of the silk factory said: We must find a way to save her, otherwise we would be letting down the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The baby was quickly sent to Suzhou Boji Hospital, at which time she was already at death's door. Therefore, the doctors and nurses became nervous and put the baby in an electric incubator, watching over her day and night. In the eight days, her breathing stopped three times, and each time she stopped breathing, the doctor immediately performed emergency treatment, and soon, the baby finally improved. The hospital notified the silk factory of the good news, and the factory workers happily sent all kinds of floral clothes, hats, shoes and milk powder to congratulate her. The Xinjiang workers studying at the silk factory gathered excitedly to name her, and everyone said that she was born in a happy era, so they called her "Flower of Happiness" (Reli Gu).
    Although Reli Gu was out of danger, her physical condition was very weak. The doctor said that she needed long-term recuperation in the hospital and needed to be fed breast milk. However, because her mother had a premature birth and was physically weak, she had not had any milk after giving birth. In order to ensure that the baby could live healthily, a nurse in the hospital automatically fed her own child milk and let Reli Gu eat her own milk, working hard to raise Reli Gu day and night. After five months, Reli Gu's health had improved greatly and she returned to the silk factory. She was cared for in the nursery, and the factory sent people to Shanghai to buy her a lot of milk powder.
    In May of this year, the Xinjiang workers at the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Factory finished their studies. Nur Nisha Xilifu was about to take her lovely child back to Xinjiang, and the silk factory workers gave the mother and daughter a lot of gifts like relatives, and took them all the way to the station. Reli Gu was passed from one person's arms to another, and everyone scrambled to hug her and kiss her. Nur Nisha Xilifu and her child had just arrived in Lanzhou when they received a letter from the staff of the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Factory asking about the health of the mother and daughter. A few days after they returned to the Hotan Silk Reeling and Weaving Factory, they received a second letter.
    During our conversation with Nur Nisha Xilifu, her eyes were filled with tears. She said excitedly: "Reli Gu is a daughter born under the unity of nationalities."

    幸福的花
    ——记一个维吾尔族婴儿的诞生
    新华社记者　韩文慧  艾海提
    在新疆和阗缫丝织绸厂开工的前夕，我们访问了一个从江苏省苏州第一丝厂学习归来的维吾尔族缫丝女工奴尔尼沙西里甫。她最近正忙着找人帮她写信给苏州第一丝厂全体职工，感谢他们救活了她在苏州生的女儿热里古。我们走进奴尔尼沙西里甫的宿舍时，这个在祖国土地上作了长途旅行的小生命热里古，正舒适地躺在摇篮里。她已经九个多月了，身上穿着苏州第一丝厂送给的红色小裙和粉红色的绒衣；脚上穿着小花鞋，黑黑的眉毛下面一对闪光的大眼睛不停的转动。热里古的诞生是一段动人的故事。
    奴尔尼沙西里甫是新疆南部叶城县一个农村妇女。去年夏天和阗缫丝织绸厂招考工人到苏州学习时，她耐心地说服了父亲和丈夫，同六十多个各族姑娘一道离开家乡，到一万多里以外的苏州去学习。不久，奴尔尼沙西里甫便感到身体越来越不舒服，终日四肢无力，站在车间眼前发黑。经过医生检查说她怀孕了。奴尔尼沙西里甫非常耽心：能不能坚持下来跟大家一道学习呢？她想到丝厂职工诚恳耐心教她学习技术的情景，就下定决心要学会技术。教她的老师和车间汉族工人好多次劝她休息，但她都拒绝了。到十一月初，她已学会掌握十五个磁眼。但由于过分劳碌，腹内的婴儿还不到七个月就出生了。
    小姑娘生下来只有两斤半重，像只小猫那么大，三天以后还不会吃奶。丝厂医务所想了各种办法来急救，仍然无效。丝厂领导人说：一定得想办法把她救活，要不然就对不起新疆各族人民。婴儿很快被送到苏州博济医院，这时她已经气息奄奄。于是，医生、护士都紧张起来，他们把婴儿装进电温箱，日夜看守着。八天当中，她呼吸断了三次，每次断气以后，医生立即进行急救，不久，婴儿终于好转了。医院把好消息通知了丝厂，厂里职工十分高兴地送了各种各样花衣服、帽子、鞋子和奶粉来祝贺。在丝厂学习的新疆工人兴奋地聚在一起给她命名，大家都说她生在幸福的时代里，就叫她“幸福的花”（热里古）。
    热里古虽然转危为安，但体质很弱，医生说要在医院里长期疗养，并且要喂人奶。但她母亲因为早产和身体衰弱，生产后一直没有奶汁。医院一位护士为了使这个婴儿能够健康的活下去，自动地用牛奶喂自己的孩子，让热里古吃自己的奶，日夜辛劳地抚养着热里古。这样经过了五个月，热里古的身体已很健康，回到了丝厂，在托儿所托养，厂里还派人到上海给她买来了许多奶粉。
    今年五月，苏州第一丝厂的新疆工人学习完毕。奴尔尼沙西里甫要带着可爱的孩子回新疆了，丝厂职工像亲人一样给母女两人送了好多礼物，一直把她们送到车站。热里古从这个人的怀抱里传到那个人的怀抱里，大家争着抱她、吻她。奴尔尼沙西里甫和她的孩子刚刚到达兰州，便接到苏州第一丝厂的职工问候母女的健康的来信，她们回到和阗缫丝织绸厂不几天，就又接到了第二封信。
    奴尔尼沙西里甫在和我们谈话当中，两眼充盈着热泪，她激动地说：“热里古是民族团结下诞生的女儿”。
