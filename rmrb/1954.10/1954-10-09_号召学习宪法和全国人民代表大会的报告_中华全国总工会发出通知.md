    The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which has great historical significance, has been born.

This is a strong guarantee and a great encouragement for our socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    Trade union organizations at all levels should, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, widely publicize the Constitution to the broad masses of workers and staff, explain the articles of the Constitution to the workers and staff, and explain Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" and Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," and organize the masses to study these documents. When studying these documents, discussions should be combined with practice to educate workers and staff to become patriotic and law-abiding models, abide by labor discipline, cherish public property, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, actively participate in labor competitions, carry out technical innovation movements, learn from advanced Soviet experience, and ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of national plans, and strive to build our country into a prosperous and strong socialist country!
