The vast majority of disaster victims who were transferred from the flood-affected areas along the Yangtze River and lakes in Hubei Province have returned to their hometowns. With the strong support of the people's government, returning disaster victims in various places have relied on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to overcome many difficulties in rebuilding their homes and restoring production. In the severely flooded areas of Huangmei, Guangji, and Yangxin counties, some houses needed repairs. Returning disaster victims organized themselves, brought collective wisdom and strength into play, and solved a major problem by adopting methods such as converting large houses into small ones and using leftover bricks and waste materials to build shared dwellings. In order not to miss the farming season, increase grain production, and fundamentally solve the problem of production and survival, returning disaster victims in various places actively organized themselves to carry out drainage and emergency planting campaigns in the spirit of "reclaiming one mu, planting one mu; draining one fen, planting one fen." Xie Wentai's mutual aid team in Shundian Township, Yunmeng County, raised field ridges and used vehicles, water scoops, and carrying methods to drain more than 13 mu of land in three days, and rush-planted crops. Driven by this mutual aid team, more than 20 households in the entire bay organized to drain water, and in three days, they drained and rush-planted a total of 125 mu. Under the impetus of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, Xinzhou County promptly rush-planted 70,000 to 80,000 mu of winter crops in the already drained fields. During the rush planting, some places had excessively deep water, which was difficult to drain for the time being. In order not to miss the winter sowing season, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places also promoted the method of wheat transplantation.

After the disaster victims returned to their hometowns one after another, the people's government allocated a large amount of funds to organize disaster victims for production. For the urgently needed materials for disaster victims to rebuild their homes, the economic departments have successively purchased more than 80,000 cubic meters of small fir wood and more than 2 million bamboo poles from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, and purchased more than 220,000 reed mats from Zhenjiang to supply the disaster areas. In order to support the disaster victims to restore production, relevant departments also purchased 600,000 jin of vegetable seeds from other provinces and transferred more than 30 million jin of barley seeds to solve the problem of winter sowing seeds in the disaster areas. At the same time, a large number of tung oil, hemp, and other fishery supplies have also been prepared to meet the needs of the upcoming full-scale fishery production.

    湖北省回乡灾民组织起来恢复生产
      湖北省沿江滨湖地区转移到外地的灾民绝大部分已返回家乡。各地返乡灾民，在人民政府大力扶助下，依靠互助合作组织，克服了在重建家园和恢复生产中的许多困难。黄梅、广济、阳新三县水淹区部分房屋需要修整，返乡灾民组织起来，发挥集体的智慧和力量，采取将大屋改小屋，利用残砖废料伙搭伙住，解决了很大问题。为了不误农时，增产粮食作物，从根本上解决生产度荒问题，各地返乡灾民均积极组织起来根据“退一亩，种一亩；排一分，种一分”的精神，开展排水抢种运动。云梦县顺店乡谢文太互助组，将田埂加高，用车、戽、挑的办法，三天排出十三亩多田，并抢种了农作物。在这个互助组的带动下，全湾二十多户组织起来排渍，三天时间，共排水抢种一百二十五亩。在农业生产合作社、互助组的带动下，新洲县在已退出的田地中，及时抢种了七、八万亩冬季作物。在抢种中，有的地方渍水过深，一时尚难退出，为了不误冬播季节，各地农业生产合作社、互助组还推广了小麦移植方法。
      各地灾民陆续返回家乡后，人民政府即拨出大量款项，组织灾民生产。对灾民重建家园所急需的器材，经济部门已在广东、广西、湖南、江西等省，陆续采购了小杉木八万余立方公尺，楠竹二百多万根，从镇江购芦席二十二万多条，以供应灾区；为了支持灾民恢复生产，有关部门并向外省采购蔬菜种籽六十万斤，调入大麦种三千余万斤，解决灾区冬播种籽困难；同时又准备了大量桐油、麻等渔业用品，以供应即将全面开展的渔业生产需要。
