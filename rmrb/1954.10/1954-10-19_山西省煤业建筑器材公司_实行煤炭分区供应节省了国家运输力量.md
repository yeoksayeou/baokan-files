    Shanxi Provincial Coal Industry Building Materials Company
    Implements Zonal Coal Supply, Saving National Transportation Capacity
    This year, the Shanxi Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company has implemented a method of rational zonal coal supply, saving national transportation capacity and reducing expenses.
    The company divided the province into five coal production and sales zones: Datong, Xinzhou, Taiyuan, Yuci, and Southern Shanxi. It implemented zonal production and sales, fixing the sales areas for all seventeen types and sixty grades of coal in the province according to the location of the production areas, transportation conditions, and market needs. At the same time, it divided the coal into varieties for intra-provincial sales and external transfer. After implementing the above measures, it gradually overcame unreasonable phenomena in coal transportation and ended the historical situation of the exchange of dozens of types of coal. From January to July, it saved a total of 3,395 transportation railcars compared to the same period last year, saving more than 1.06 billion yuan in various expenses.
    After fixing the coal varieties for sales areas, the burden on consumers was significantly reduced. After Qi County and Taigu areas switched to burning Lingshi coal and Yitang coal, they saved more than 610 million yuan in seven months. After Taiyuan area switched to burning Dongshan coal, it saved 38,000 yuan per ton. After the coal varieties were fixed, it was also more convenient for the masses to burn.
    According to the decision of the State Council on gradually promoting the rational transportation system of zonal production and sales balance of coal, the relevant departments of Shanxi Province have drafted a specific plan to further implement this system, which has been officially implemented on a trial basis since September.

    实行煤炭分区供应节省了国家运输力量
    中国煤业建筑器材公司山西分公司今年实行了煤炭分区合理供应的办法，节省了国家的运输力量，减少了费用开支。
    该公司把全省划为大同、忻县、太原、榆次、晋南五个煤炭产销区，实行煤炭区产区销，把全省十七种六十个品名的煤炭根据产区位置、运输条件和市场需要情况，固定了销售地区，同时把煤炭划分了省内销售和外调的品种。实行上述办法以后，逐步克服了煤炭运输中不合理的现象，终止了历史上数十种煤炭对流的局面。从一月到七月，共比去年同一时期节约运输车皮三千三百九十五辆，节约各项费用十亿六千多万元。
    固定煤种销区以后，消费者负担显著减轻。祁县、太谷地区改烧灵石煤和义棠煤以后，七个月节省六亿一千多万元。太原地区改烧东山煤以后，每吨节省三万八千元。煤种固定以后，群众烧用起来也较前方便。
    山西省有关部门根据政务院关于逐步推行煤炭分区产销平衡合理运输制度的决定，拟出了进一步贯彻这一制度的具体方案，已经从九月份开始正式试行。
