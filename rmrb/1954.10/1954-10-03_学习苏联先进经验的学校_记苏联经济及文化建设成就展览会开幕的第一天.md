A School for Learning Advanced Soviet Experiences
    ——On the First Day of the Opening of the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction
    By our reporters Fu Dong and Yu Ming

    On the afternoon of October 2nd, the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction opened at the Soviet Exhibition Center in the western suburbs of the capital.

    After the opening ceremony, the people who attended walked into the central hall to begin their visit. As soon as they entered, they were immediately attracted by the four huge colorful murals in the hall. The upper parts of the murals were respectively inscribed with: "The Soviet Union is a free alliance of equal nations," "Soviet citizens have the right to work," "Soviet citizens have the right to education," and "Soviet citizens have the right to rest." These are the themes of the four murals, which illustrate the happy life enjoyed by the Soviet people under the Soviet regime.

    From the central hall, visitors entered the various pavilions for visits in three routes.

    From the central hall to the north, visitors arrived at the Industrial Pavilion, which occupies the largest area. Meng Tai, Zhang Mingshan, Zhao Guoyou, Wang Chonglun, Ma Hengchang, and Li Fenglian, all nationally renowned industrial labor models, moved from one lathe to another, carefully reading the instructions on the lathes and exchanging opinions from time to time. Some took out notebooks and quickly recorded. When they saw Soviet comrades demonstrating on the "Coordinate Boring Machine Model 2430," they all stopped. Zhao Guoyou said, "This lathe can rotate 2,800 revolutions per minute, which is really remarkable. Our lathes can only reach 1,200 revolutions per minute at the fastest." They watched and gestured to ask questions; Soviet comrades answered with gestures, and sometimes, when they saw that everyone didn't understand, they drew on paper. Wang Chonglun remembered the most carefully, and he recorded that the precision of this machine reached 0.01 mm. They stood for a long time and were still reluctant to leave, they wanted to record everything they saw in their minds without any difference, write it in their notebooks, and bring it back to the factory to tell all the workers. Soviet comrades also demonstrated again and again, wanting to teach everyone everything they knew all at once. When they parted, they shook hands with everyone again and again, and gestured to welcome everyone to come again.

    In front of the large artistic pictures and charts illustrating the growth of Soviet oil, coal, iron, and steel production, there were also many spectators.

    Visitors visited the electrical equipment, printing machines, and textile machines with equally great interest.

    The electrical measuring instruments, modern communication equipment, railway and highway transportation equipment, and models of sea and river transportation displayed on both sides of the Heavy Industry Pavilion also attracted many visitors. What particularly made the audience reluctant to leave was the precise integrators, computers, meteorological instruments, and optical instruments displayed in the right hall. Many spectators stood in front of the electron microscope that could magnify 40,000 times, watching it again and again, unwilling to leave.

    There are two squares on both sides of the Industrial Pavilion. On the left square, fifty-six newly painted agricultural machines were displayed. Many agricultural labor models came here and were reluctant to leave. They were fascinated by the corn combine harvester. This machine can not only separate corn stalks and cobs, but also chop the corn stalks into small feed. The mining and road construction machinery and various automobiles, water pumps, and compressors on the right square were also very eye-catching. The large truck that can load twenty-five tons of cargo was seen for the first time in China. Its tires are as tall as a person. The excavator that can dig one cubic meter of soil at a time also shook its huge body to perform in the square.

    Many industrial labor models had many feelings after visiting the Industrial Pavilion. Meng Tai said: "Today I took a vivid lesson, I will definitely tell our factory's workers what I have learned, so that everyone can improve the technical innovation movement by one step." Ma Hengchang said: "With the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, coupled with the production enthusiasm of our workers, we will be able to build a socialist society smoothly." Wang Chonglun said: "After seeing the Industrial Pavilion, I realized more clearly that in order to implement the technical transformation of the entire national economy, we must first focus on developing heavy industry."

    Many agricultural labor models who came to the Agricultural Pavilion felt that their eyes were not enough, and they did not know which one to look at first. Qu Yaoli, our country's cotton planting expert, stood next to the cotton plants full of huge cotton bolls, carefully counting the number of cotton bolls; some of these cotton plants had forty or fifty cotton bolls, which made people happy to see. Agricultural labor model Li Shunda was very interested in every part of the Agricultural Pavilion. He and the people who visited with him carefully observed the high-yield wheat, corn, and various hemp. Two huge fake sheep particularly attracted him. Each of these sheep can shear 19.4 kilograms of wool per year, but in Li Shunda's hometown, a sheep can only shear about two kilograms of wool per year. After he saw the exhibits in the entire Agricultural Pavilion, he said: "The achievements in all aspects of Soviet agriculture illustrated by these exhibits are all true; there are many things in the products, I saw them with my own eyes when I visited the Soviet Union in 1952." He also said: "The Soviet people are sincerely helping us, not only letting us visit the Soviet Union, but also exhibiting the achievements of agricultural production, so that more farmers in our country can see these achievements and learn from their experience."

    The second floor of the Industrial Pavilion displays light industrial products. Here are various precious furs and exquisite woolens, velvets, silks, yarns, and cloths. Visitors who have seen the Industrial Pavilion, and then look at the Light Industry Pavilion and the Cultural Life Pavilion displaying daily necessities and furniture for the people, as well as the comfortable Moscow Restaurant, will naturally think of the sentence written on the central wall of the Industrial Pavilion: "The purpose of the development of Soviet socialist production is to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society."

    Thousands of visitors came to the Cultural Pavilion. The exhibits and books on the exhibition stands, as well as the model of Moscow University, vividly introduced the development of Soviet culture, education, and science. In the Art Gallery, those world-famous oil paintings, sculptures, prints, and illustrations of literary masterpieces aroused endless admiration from people. In particular, the oil painting "Great Friendship" depicting the meeting of Chairman Mao and Comrade Stalin gave people infinite encouragement. People talked excitedly in front of the painting. Some people said: After seeing the achievements of the Soviet people in industrial, agricultural and cultural construction, they know that these works truly reflect the real life of the Soviet people.

    The visitors also visited the Cinema and the Open-air Theater.

    It was getting dark, and batches of visitors gathered in the rest hall, drinking tea and talking about their feelings about the visit. At this time, the red star on the gilded iron tower standing high in the sky emitted a ruby-like crystal light. The lights on the emblems of the sixteen Soviet republics also lit up. From a distance, they looked like strings of pearls. The entire building looked even more beautiful.

    Looking at the brightly lit exhibition hall, people felt unspeakable joy in their hearts. Here we saw the reality of happy socialism and saw the future of our motherland.

    学习苏联先进经验的学校
    ——记苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕的第一天
    本报记者　傅冬　于明
    十月二日的下午，苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会在首都西郊的苏联展览馆开幕了。
    开幕典礼举行过后，参加典礼的人们走进了中央大厅开始参观。他们一走进去，立刻就被大厅内
  四幅巨大的彩色壁画吸引住了。壁画的上部分别写着：“苏联是各平等民族的自由联盟”“苏联公民有劳动权”“苏联公民有享受教育权”“苏联公民有休息权”。这是四幅壁画的主题，它说明了苏联人民在苏维埃政权下所享受的幸福生活。
    从中央大厅，参观者分三路进入各馆参观。
    从中央大厅向北，参观者来到了占面积最大的工业馆。全国著名的工业劳动模范孟泰、张明山、赵国有、王崇伦、马恒昌和李凤莲从这台车床转到那台车床，十分注意地看着车床的说明，并不时地交换意见。有的拿出笔记本迅速地记录着。当他们看到苏联同志在“坐标搪床2430型”的机床上表演时，都站住了。赵国有说：“这台车床一分钟能转二千八百转，真了不起。咱们的车床一分钟最快才一千二百转。”他们一面看，一面用手势比着发问；苏联同志用手势回答着，有时看大家实在不明白，就用笔在纸上画。王崇伦记得最仔细，他把这台机器的精确度达○点○一公厘都记了下来。站得时间不短了，他们还舍不得离开，他们要把自己所看到的东西，一丝不差地记到脑子里，写到本子上，带回厂里讲给全厂的工人。苏联同志也是表演了一次又一次，想一下子把自己所知道的东西都教给大家。临分手的时候，他再三和大伙握手，并且用手势表示欢迎大伙再来看。
    那些说明苏联石油、煤、铁、钢等产量的增长的大幅美术图片和图表前面，也围了不少的观众。
    参观者怀着同样大的兴趣参观了电气设备、印刷机器和纺织机器。
    重工业馆两侧陈列的电气测量仪器、现代通讯器材、铁路和公路运输装备，海运和河运的模型也吸引了不少的观众。特别使观众流连不舍的是右侧厅陈列的那些精密的积分机、计算机、气象仪器、光学仪器。许多观众站在那台能放大四万倍的电子显微镜前看了一遍又一遍，不愿走开。
    工业馆两边有两个广场。左边广场上陈列着五十六部漆得崭新的农业机器。许多农业劳动模范走到这里，都舍不得走开，他们对那部玉蜀黍联合收割机看得着迷了。这部机器不但可以把玉蜀黍棒子和秆子割离，而且还能把玉蜀黍秆子切成碎小的饲料。右边广场上的采矿、筑路机械和各种汽车、水泵、压缩机也非常引人注目。能装二十五吨货的大卡车在中国还是头一次看到。它的轮胎就有一人高。一次能挖一立方公尺土的掘土机也摇着它的巨大身躯在广场表演。
    许多工业劳动模范参观了工业馆，都有很多感想。孟泰说：“今天我上了生动的一课，我一定把我所学到的讲给我们厂的工人，让大家把技术革新运动提高一步。”马恒昌说：“有了苏联的先进经验，再加上我们工人的生产积极性，我们就能够顺利地建设社会主义社会。”王崇伦说：“看了工业馆，使我更清楚地认识到：要实行整个国民经济的技术改造，首先就需要着重发展重工业。”
    许多农业劳动模范到了农业馆，都觉得自己的眼睛不够使唤，不知该先看那一样好。我国植棉能手曲耀离，站在结满了巨大棉桃的棉株旁边，细细地数着棉桃的数目；这些棉株上有的结了四、五十个棉桃，看了真是使人喜欢。农业劳动模范李顺达，对于农业馆的每一部分都感到很大的兴趣。他和一同参观的人们，详细观察高产量的小麦、玉蜀黍和各种麻。两个巨大的假羊特别吸引住他。这种羊每只每年能剪十九点四公斤羊毛，但是在李顺达的家乡，一只绵羊每年只能剪二斤左右羊毛。他看了整个农业馆的展品后说：“这些展品所说明的苏联农业各方面的成就，都是千真万确的；产品中有许多东西，
  一九五二年我在苏联参观时，都亲眼看见过。”他又说：“苏联人民对我们是真心的帮助，不但让我们到苏联去参观，还把农业生产的成就拿来展览，让我国更多的农民都能够看到这些成就，学习他们的经验。”
    工业馆的二楼陈列的是轻工业品。这里有各种贵重的皮毛和精致的呢、绒、绸缎、纱和布匹。参观者看了工业馆，再看看轻工业馆和陈列人民日常用品及家具的文化生活馆，以及舒适的莫斯科餐厅，很自然地会想起在工业馆正中墙上写的那句话：“苏联社会主义生产发展的目的是保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”
    成千的参观者来到了文化馆。展览台上的展品、书籍，及莫斯科大学的模型，生动地介绍了苏联文教、科学的发展情况。在美术馆里，那些全世界闻名的油画、雕塑、版画和文学名著的插画，引起人们不绝的赞赏。特别是那幅描绘毛主席和斯大林同志会见的“伟大的友谊”的油画，给了人们无穷的鼓舞。人们在画前兴奋地谈着。有的人说：看了苏联人民在工、农业和文化建设方面的成就以后，就知道这些作品都是真实地反映苏联人民现实生活的。
    参观的人们还参观了电影馆和露天剧场。
    天渐渐黑了起来，一批批的参观者聚集到休息厅里，一面饮茶，一面谈论着参观的感想。这时，那矗立在高空中的镏金铁塔上边的红星发出红宝石一样晶莹的光芒。苏联十六个加盟共和国国徽上的灯也亮起来了。远远看去好像一串一串的珍珠。整个建筑显得更加美丽了。
    望着那灯火辉煌的展览馆，人们心里真有说不出的快乐。在这里我们看到了幸福的社会主义的现实，看到了我们祖国的明天。
