    Many Major Hospitals in Beijing Hire Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors
    Tianjin Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic Opens
    Many major hospitals in Beijing have hired traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctors to participate in their work.
    Since the two TCM consultants hired by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Beijing Hospital started working in August, they have provided multiple treatments for patients with bronchial asthma, hypertension, and neurasthenia. These two hospitals have also hired specially-invited TCM doctors to participate in treatment work. The two hospitals have specifically designated internal medicine doctors to learn from the TCM consultants and promptly report their learning experiences to the hospital leaders. A TCM academic reporting meeting is held every two weeks. Specially-invited TCM doctors have been asked to give reports such as "History of Chinese Medicine" and "Introduction to Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica." Both hospitals have established TCM decoction rooms, with dedicated personnel responsible for decocting medicines and purchasing Chinese medicinal materials.
    The Central People's Hospital, the First Children's Hospital of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau, the Second Children's Hospital, and five other hospitals have hired TCM doctors to participate in treatment work between September and October. The First Children's Hospital has established an acupuncture department since July last year, using acupuncture to treat children's indigestion, enuresis, and infantile paralysis, achieving significant results. On October 5 this year, the First Children's Hospital officially established a TCM outpatient department, adding a TCM internal medicine department in addition to the original acupuncture department. The First and Second Children's Hospitals will establish TCM pediatric wards after merging to form a new children's hospital. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Also Reported: The Tianjin Municipal TCM Clinic opened on the 17th. This is Tianjin's first government-established TCM medical and research institution.
    In addition to its medical tasks, the Tianjin Municipal TCM Clinic is also the center for sorting out and researching TCM academics in Tianjin, and it also creates conditions for the future establishment of a Tianjin Municipal TCM Experimental Hospital. The Tianjin Municipal TCM Clinic has five departments: internal medicine, gynecology, pediatrics, acupuncture, and bone setting, and has hired twenty-one experienced TCM doctors to participate in the work. In order to work with Western medicine to sort out and study the heritage of Chinese medicine, this clinic will establish technical cooperation relationships with larger hospitals such as the Tianjin Municipal Third Hospital.

    北京市好些大医院已聘请中医师参加工作。
    中国协和医学院附属医院和北京医院聘请的两个中医顾问自八月开始工作以来，已对支气管喘息、高血压、神经衰弱等患者进行了多次治疗。这两个医院还聘请了特约中医师参加治疗工作。这两个医院特别指定内科医师向中医顾问学习，并及时将学习心得向医院的领导人汇报。每两周举行一次中医学术报告会。已请特约中医师作了“中国医学史”、“李时珍本草纲目介绍”等报告。两院都设立了中药煎药室、设有专人负责煎药和采购中药。
    中央人民医院、北京市人民政府公共卫生局第一儿童医院和第二儿童医院等八个医院分别在九月、十月间聘请中医参加治疗工作。第一儿童医院从去年七月起已设立了针灸科门诊，应用针灸疗法治疗小儿消化不良、遗尿症、小儿麻痹症等疾病，收到显著效果。今年十月五日，第一儿童医院正式设立中医门诊部，除原有针灸科外，又增设了中医内科。第一、第二儿童医院将在合并成立新的儿童医院后，设立中医儿科病房。　　（新华社）
    又讯：天津市立中医门诊部在十七日开幕。这是天津市第一所由政府设立的中医医疗和研究机构。
    天津市立中医门诊部除担负医疗任务外，并且是天津市整理和研究中医学术的中心，同时为将来设立天津市立中医实验医院创造条件。天津市立中医门诊部共设有内科、妇科、小儿科、针灸科和正骨科等五科，聘请了二十一个有经验的中医师参加工作。为了和西医一道整理和研究祖国医学遗产，这个门诊部将同天津市立第三医院等较大的医院建立技术合作关系。
