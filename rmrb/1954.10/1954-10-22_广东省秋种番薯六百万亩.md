Guangdong Province has basically completed the autumn planting of six million mu of sweet potatoes. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties in the northern Guangdong area, including Yingde and Qingyuan, in addition to planting sweet potatoes in all the areas where they were planted last autumn, the planting area has been expanded by more than 180,000 mu. Many farmers in the Pearl River Delta also use banana fields and mulberry fields to intercrop sweet potatoes. Farmers in Chengmai County on Hainan Island are actively reclaiming wasteland to grow sweet potatoes. Since September, more than 70% of the farmers in Meiting Township in the county have reclaimed more than 2,800 mu of wasteland, an average of 4 mu per household, and all of them have been planted with sweet potatoes.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes, various places are currently stepping up their efforts in turning vines, cultivating soil, weeding, and applying top dressing. At present, the sweet potato seedlings are growing well, and the early-planted seedlings have grown to more than four feet long.

    广东省秋种番薯六百万亩
    广东省六百万亩秋种番薯已基本下种完毕。粤北区据英德、清远等十个县不完全统计：除去年秋种地区已全部种上番薯外，并扩大种植面积十八万多亩。珠江三角洲上许多农民还利用蕉地、桑地间作番薯。海南岛上的澄迈县农民则积极开荒种番薯，该县美亭乡百分之七十以上的农户于九月份以来共开荒二千八百多亩，平均每户开荒四亩，都种上了番薯。
    为了争取番薯丰收，目前各地正加紧进行翻蔓培土、除草追肥等工作。现在各地薯苗都生长良好，早种的薯苗已长四尺多长。
