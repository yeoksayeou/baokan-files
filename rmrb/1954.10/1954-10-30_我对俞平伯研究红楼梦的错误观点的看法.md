    My Views on Yu Pingbo's Erroneous Views on Researching *Dream of the Red Chamber*
    Zhou Ruchang
    The recent criticism in newspapers and periodicals of Yu Pingbo's viewpoints and methods in researching *Dream of the Red Chamber* should be given special attention by us classical literature researchers. Only by everyone participating in the discussion and eliminating erroneous bourgeois thinking can we advance and improve the research work on literary heritage.
    Almost from the moment *Dream of the Red Chamber* was published, the so-called "Redology" appeared. Mr. Lu Xun pointed out in "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" that Yuan Mei's "Author's Preface" in *Suiyuan Shihua* appeared earliest but was confirmed last (page 250) [Note 1]; in the meantime, various "speculative theories" have accumulated over time. Why? I personally believe that, as Mr. Lu Xun discussed the novels of human sentiments in the late Ming Dynasty, "allegorical criticisms in unofficial histories existed in the Jin and Tang dynasties, but flourished in the Ming, especially in novels of human sentiments" (page 230); "Ming novels that promoted lewd morals often alluded to specific figures, using words to avenge old feuds" (page 191); "the sharpness of the satire, or beyond the edge of the blade, except for *A Supplement to the Journey to the West*, seemed concentrated on one person or one family" (page 230). Afterwards, speculative theories increased daily, saying it was about a certain prime minister, a certain duke, a certain emperor who abdicated and became a monk, or about a struggle for the throne, or a "major Qing dynasty event" or something else. In short, it can be seen that a fundamental view runs through it: related to Qing dynasty politics. Later, some people even thought it was secretly writing about the national consciousness of "opposing the Qing and longing for the Ming." Regardless of how inappropriate its method of textual research was, it is quite obvious that it was a major ideological development. This situation is worth noting.
    When "Redology" fell into the hands of Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo, its face and spirit changed completely. Where did the main change lie? Hu Shi himself said that his textual research on novels was to teach "young friends" a little "self-defense," so as not to "be led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin" (Preface to Hu Shi's Selected Works). And Yu Pingbo's efforts to extract any socio-political significance from it, turning *Dream of the Red Chamber* into just a good "love affair" drama, is also very clear.
    If a young intellectual before liberation did not understand Marxism and came into contact with the topic of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, he would become a prisoner of Hu and Yu in terms of textual research methods. I myself am an example. In my book "New Evidence for *Dream of the Red Chamber*," I compared the characters in the novel with the Cao family lineage everywhere, saying that the dates in the novel coincided with the author's actual life, and that the novel was a "carefully tailored record of real life," which is the most prominent evidence. This was of course because, when I wrote the book in the past, I mainly wanted to emphasize and prove Mr. Lu Xun's theory of "realism" and "autobiography," in order to destroy the still quite strong potential of the theory of allegorical interpretations at that time. However, due to the erroneous understanding of realism, and the deep influence of Hu and Yu's methods, the result was that it actually guided readers to deepen their erroneous understanding of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. However, moving the study of *Dream of the Red Chamber* from being combined with socio-politics to being separated from socio-politics was not my goal. On the contrary, I wanted to find the socio-political significance of *Dream of the Red Chamber* and to see the *Dream of the Red Chamber* more closely linked to socio-politics, within the limited level of my own knowledge and theory. I firmly oppose treating this great classical realist novel *Dream of the Red Chamber* as a tool for some people to anesthetize young people and as a boring object for some people to "play around with."
    We know that "classical art is usually produced on the basis of contradictions in the social and economic system, but it usually does not defend this system. The most outstanding works of art mainly appear in times of transition, that is, in times related to huge social changes. Therefore, classical art always opposes, in one way or another, all old, decadent, and reactionary things, opposes social hypocrisy and sin, and opposes the corrupt and evil atmosphere." [Note 2]
    Therefore, to study *Dream of the Red Chamber*, one must first have a relatively clear understanding of the contradictions in the social and economic system of Cao Xueqin's time, of his own real life, of his method of creation that developed the art tradition with a rich realist spirit, and of the relationship between this method of creation and his worldview; otherwise, it is impossible to conduct an in-depth study and research on Cao Xueqin's creative methods and artistic achievements. However, to date, our understanding of these issues is extremely limited.
    In short, what is the socio-political background of *Dream of the Red Chamber*?
    We know that there are many contradictions within the ruling class. The feudal emperor stood at the forefront of these contradictions, and he desperately needed claws and eyes to consolidate his throne. Some of these claws and eyes were his closest servants, and these people directly influenced the politics of the time. The eunuch Wei Zhongxian and the wet nurse Madam Ke of the Ming Dynasty are the best examples. The early Qing Dynasty, in view of this, curtailed eunuchs and set up the Imperial Household Department [Note 3]. Thus, the bondservants of the Imperial Household Department (royal family slaves) took control of the various duties originally performed by eunuchs. Cao Xueqin's ancestors were Manchurian bondservants. Cao Yin, as the son of Emperor Kangxi's wet nurse, gained the most trust and took charge of the textile manufacturing, salt administration, and canal transport. The Qing court's income, in addition to the land tax, was largely from the salt tax (annual revenue of about 7.5 million taels), and the Lianghuai salt tax was its main item (annual revenue of about 3.4 million taels). Cao Yin and others could make a surplus of five or six hundred thousand taels per year from their official duties alone, and the amount of money they made by extortion was staggering. This is a small part of the life of the ruling exploiters.
    Such families were naturally participants and promoters of friction in the internal contradictions of the ruling class. Thus, they engaged in factionalism and all kinds of tricks. We know that the three major factions in the Kangxi era were the Manchu official Mingzhu faction, the Han official Xu Qianxue faction, and the imperial prince Yin Si faction, and the three factions were interrelated. However, the Cao family faction had quite close relations with all three factions. The contradiction finally manifested itself in the event of the princes fighting for the throne. Yin Zhen, Yin Si's mortal enemy, won and massacred the Yin Si faction with extreme cruelty. Cao family faction relatives and friends were all subjected to pressure. This group of people was generally dissatisfied with the politics of the time, some attempted to subvert it, and others showed various forms of active and passive resistance. Cao Xueqin himself, his family, relatives, and friends, were in such a political environment. Their fates were similar and connected.
    The structure of the feudal system in the Qing Dynasty was layered. The lowest level was the Han people. After the Manchus entered the pass, they forcibly occupied the houses and land of the Han people in the vicinity of the capital on a large scale as "banner property." The imperial family's manor fields, the clan's manor fields, and the Eight Banners' manor fields alone (excluding garrison manor fields) amounted to as many as 160,000 to 170,000 hectares. Banner people, in addition to having salaries for being officials, were also given rations according to the number of people, with half rations for those under six years old and full rations for those above. This ruling exploitation group thus did not engage in production, idled their time away, ate and drank well, and lived extravagantly. Gambling, listening to operas, singing songs, fighting chickens, horse racing, displaying trinkets, and all kinds of strange and tricky hobbies were their daily lives. The Cao family was a member of these families, and Cao Xueqin's novel exposed the lives of such families.
    The budding of Chinese capitalism had already appeared in the late Ming Dynasty, but it was immediately stifled by the severe feudal economy of the Qing Dynasty. Before the Opium War, the entire Qing Dynasty economy was in a period of strict closed feudal economic stagnation. Cao Xueqin lived during this period. He died in the twenty-eighth year of Qianlong, that is, February 1764, more than 70 years before the outbreak of the Opium War. That is to say, Cao Xueqin lived a whole century before this great historical event. Therefore, the degree and form of his work's resistance to the feudal system were also restricted by the historical conditions of the time.
    However, the "Redologists" of the Hu Shi and Yu Pingbo school tried their best to turn *Dream of the Red Chamber* into a small game, guiding readers to drill into trivial interests and blurring the profound significance of this great classical realist masterpiece. What is Yu Pingbo's overall understanding of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, after studying it for a full thirty years? I think the answer is three words: "unknowable." In December 1950, when he wrote the "Preface" to "Research on *Dream of the Red Chamber*," he taught readers:
    As for the questions of *Dream of the Red Chamber* itself, which often cause me to misunderstand, there is no way to talk about them. I have said that this book is a "nightmare" on the Chinese literary scene. The more you study it, the more confused you become. (Emphasis added by me, same below)
    This is Yu Pingbo's experience and summary after studying *Dream of the Red Chamber* for a full thirty years. Because he was very confused about the title of the novel and the author's name, he said again:
    From this point of view, it can be seen that *Dream of the Red Chamber* is indeed, without any discount, the first strange book. How can we, ordinary people, sigh at the ocean and start writing! (page 3)
    Therefore, Yu Pingbo believes that this first strange book has a "fundamental problem hanging," which cannot be solved. What is the "fundamental problem"? He did not explain it. I think it should be the "unknowable" that made Yu Pingbo "the more he studied, the more confused he became." Since 1953, his many new articles, typically represented by "A Brief Discussion of *Dream of the Red Chamber*," have directly inherited this view and further developed it. The introduction of "A Brief Discussion" says:
    Why don't so many attachments occur with other novels, but so many attachments occur with *Dream of the Red Chamber*? There must be some reason for this. Therefore, it is not easy to understand *Dream of the Red Chamber* and explain *Dream of the Red Chamber*. It seems to be clear here, but you will run into a wall over there.
    Yu Pingbo's understanding of *Dream of the Red Chamber* was originally such a mysterious and completely idealist "agnosticism." He also vigorously promoted this experience to young readers who placed great expectations on him.
    Although he finally stated in the preface to "Research on *Dream of the Red Chamber*": "My research on *Dream of the Red Chamber* has not even started yet," he actually promoted his set of idealist views in a purposeful way. In the section "The Style of *Dream of the Red Chamber*," he was very dissatisfied with the "excessiveness" of *Water Margin* and praised the "gentleness" of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. He "confirmed" the "style" of the latter's "resentment without anger" or "sorrowful thoughts" and said that this is the most valuable feature of *Dream of the Red Chamber* that is superior to all old novels. We all know that "the music of a chaotic world is resentful and angry because its politics are bad; the music of a ruined country is sad and thoughtful because its people are suffering" is what the ancients said about poetry. It was originally to affirm that politics were bad and the people were suffering, and that there was "resentment" and "anger." However, Yu Pingbo advocated that "resentment" was allowed, but "anger" was not allowed, and that it should be "gentle." This is exactly the old tune of the feudal rulers' "poetry education" of "small elegance, resentment, and defamation without chaos," "gentle and honest," "stopping at etiquette and righteousness," and "preventing evil and preventing heresy" for thousands of years, a means to prevent the people from "liking chaos and rebelling." It is no wonder that Yu Pingbo was dissatisfied with *Water Margin*, which wrote about peasants "rebelling" and "overstepping," and thought it was too "excessive." Yu Pingbo also said that "*Dream of the Red Chamber* is an extremely serious tragedy," but where is the "tragedy"? He said it clearly:
    Not only the rise and fall of the Ning and Rong mansions and the glory and withering of the Twelve Beauties can make readers feel sad and tearful. (page 122)
    Mentioning Qiao Jie's ending, he said:
    This is writing about Fengjie's desolate situation after her death. It is writing about the scene of the end of the Jia family. Even the prosperous family, which has been thriving for a hundred years, cannot protect a daughter but relies on an old woman in the countryside. What kind of feelings are these! (page 155)
    Such words are often seen. If this were Cao Xueqin's thinking, it would be excusable. But this is actually Yu Pingbo's thinking. This shows that Yu Pingbo's yardstick for reading *Dream of the Red Chamber* is super-class "literary sentiment" (this word he loves to use the most, for example, when opposing people who scold Baochai, he says: "It does not conform to the facts (?) and does not conform to the literary sentiment"). The above can also be said to be "modifications" of old drafts that are not "appropriate" enough, but let's see how he really said it in his text at the end of October 1950:
    Fengjie's ending is very miserable, which is sad and touching. (page 215)
    It can be seen that after the confiscation, the Jia family members were put in prison, and Baoyu and Fengjie were both inside. At that time, the servants were scattered, but there were former maids who had been expelled who still knew how to comfort their masters. The literary sentiment is imaginable. (page 221)
    How clear! It is probably not quite right to say that his "literary sentiment" yardstick is "super"-class, because if Yu Pingbo was not standing on the side of the feudal "masters," how could he appreciate and praise the "gratitude" and "righteousness" of these servants who "still knew how to comfort their masters"? Isn't Yu Pingbo's class stance very clear here?
    Directly related to Yu Pingbo's class viewpoint is his bourgeois literary views. He once said:
    Therefore, *Dream of the Red Chamber* has a very revolutionary spirit in our literary circles. The reason why he can have such a spirit is not necessarily that he intentionally challenges society, but because he relies on facts and is forced to do so. Because the stereotypes are not all facts, the facts are ever-changing. Where is there a fixed pattern? ... I think the author of *Dream of the Red Chamber*'s first great skill is just being willing to tell the truth and just being a fair mirror. ... How plain it looks, *Dream of the Red Chamber* has become the first strange book in our Chinese literary circles in the past. (page 120)
    It is very clear: Yu Pingbo denies the objective law of real life. Authors with brains do not live and feel under this objective law and have no intention of criticizing society. They just want to be an indifferent "fair mirror" to the facts. How the author writes is all inevitable and "forced to do so." Li Xifan and Lan Ling's articles say that Yu Pingbo is a naturalist, and there is a reason for that.
    Yu Pingbo also denies that *Dream of the Red Chamber* reflects any social conflicts. Although he admits on the one hand that "public opinion is correct after all" ("A Brief Discussion of *Dream of the Red Chamber*"), he vigorously ridicules these "public" on the other hand:
    Society likes to have opposite contrasts the most. On the stage, there is a red face, and there must be a black face to accompany him. As the saying goes, "a red face is more glorious than a robe, and a white nose is stricter than an axe." In the novel, there must be a loyal minister and a traitor. ... When I was a child, when I listened to novels, I would eagerly ask: "Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy?" I felt that this was the most important and most exciting point in the novel. The reading level of the general public in society is about the same as when I was a child. Mr. Xueqin then made a joke on them. (page 121)
    In fact, Yu Pingbo probably made a joke on the broad masses of ancient and modern readers with a sense of justice and a clear sense of love and hate. They are precisely the ones who want to distinguish between good people and bad people, and "more glorious than a robe" and "stricter than an axe" is their most solemn judgment. I don't know what Yu Pingbo wants to leave for them after extracting this main social significance from the content of the work. Therefore, he opposes people scolding Baochai, Xiren, Wang夫人, etc., and then, based on a comment by Zhi, wants to combine the two positive and negative typical images of Chai and Dai, fundamentally erasing all social contradictions and inducing readers to look for certain interests only in the "love affair." He said that the comment "is particularly important" and is a "new point of view" for readers and that it should make "the three beauties one."
    In fact, as a textual researcher, Yu Pingbo is also dishonest in this regard. At the end of Chapter 28 of the Jiaxu edition, a general comment says:
    If the three were one, it would be a beautiful thing, but it is not the original intention of *The Story of the Stone* either.
    It can be seen that even the commenter at that time knew that this was inconsistent with the meaning of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Yu Pingbo does not understand the social significance of the contrasting images of Chai and Dai from the contradictions of the feudal system itself, but only seeks interest from the "love affair" and "literary sentiment." It is no wonder that he said:
    Moreover, Chai and Dai are often mentioned together in the book, like two peaks facing each other and two streams flowing separately, each extremely wonderful and not inferior to the other. It must be so that the love affair is extremely prosperous. It must be so that the writing is extremely wonderful. If Baochai is rare and bad, how can Daiyu have a status to speak of? It does not conform to the facts and does not conform to the literary sentiment. Why did Xueqin have to do it like this? (page 112)
    The matter is clearest: It turns out that in Yu Pingbo's eyes, there is no essential difference between *Dream of the Red Chamber* and those "love" novels with "triangles" and "pentagons" written by later bourgeois writers in terms of "literary sentiment." Since this is the case, it is no wonder that Yu Pingbo cannot understand "why Xueqin had to do it like this."
    I think that Yu Pingbo's viewpoint has nothing in common with the slogan he himself put forward, "further analyze it with Marxist-Leninist literary theory." Therefore, we say that Yu Pingbo's literary views are completely based on idealist thinking, which is justified.
    Why did Yu Pingbo vigorously sing the "agnosticism" of *Dream of the Red Chamber* when he said that he already knew that he should treat *Dream of the Red Chamber* with Marxist-Leninist literary theory? I think this may reflect a specific contradiction between Yu Pingbo's idealist thinking and new things and positive contact with Marxism-Leninism. Although Yu Pingbo, on the one hand, cannot but come into contact with Marxist-Leninist literary theory because everyone is studying Marxism-Leninism, Marxist-Leninist literary theory is inconsistent with his idealist views everywhere. Therefore, he promoted "agnosticism."
    We should eliminate bourgeois erroneous thinking, continue to explore many issues related to *Dream of the Red Chamber* in a down-to-earth manner along the correct path, and open up a broader and more glorious road for the research work on classical literary heritage.
    [Note 1] Mr. Lu Xun originally determined that the "autobiography" theory first appeared in the early Jiaqing period based on "Suiyuan Shihua." Now, the source of that article in "Shihua" has been found in Mingyi's "Lvyansuo Chuangji." It can be roughly determined that it is a record from around the thirty-fifth year of Qianlong to the forty-sixth year at the latest, that is, a statement that appeared six or seven years to sixteen or seventeen years after Cao Xueqin's death.

    我对俞平伯研究红楼梦的错误观点的看法
    周汝昌
    最近报刊上对俞平伯研究红楼梦的观点和方法提出批评，我们古典文学研究者都应特别重视。只有大家参加讨论，肃清错误的资产阶级思想，才能把文学遗产研究工作推进并提高一步。
    差不多从红楼梦一出世，马上就有所谓“红学”出现。鲁迅先生在“中国小说史略”里指出：袁枚“随园诗话”的“作者自叙”一说，其出现实最先，而确定反最后（页二五○）〔注一〕；中间种种“揣测之说，久而遂多”。为什么呢？个人以为，这正如鲁迅先生论列明末人情小说时所指出的：“寓讥弹于稗史者，晋、唐已有，而明为盛，尤在人情小说中”（页二三○）；“明小说之宣扬秽德者，人物每有所指，盖借文字以报夙雠”（页一九一）；“讥刺之切，或逾锋刃，而西游补之外，每似集中于一人或一家”（页二三○）。嗣后揣测之说日多，说某相国、某公侯，说某皇帝弃位出家，说夺嫡，说“清代一大事”或说其他。总之，可以看出，中间贯穿着一个根本看法：与清代政治有关。到后来有些人更以为是暗写“排满思明”的民族意识，不管其索隐方法如何不当，但其为一个主要思想的发展，固甚显然。这一情形是值得注意的。
    及至“红学”落到胡适和俞平伯手里，面目精神于是一变。主要变在哪里呢？胡适自己说，他作小说考证，是教给“少年朋友们”学一点“防身的本领”，不要“被马克思列宁斯大林牵着鼻子走”（胡适文选自序）。而俞平伯竭力抽掉其中任何社会政治意义，使红楼梦只变为一个“情场”的好把戏，也是十分显明的。
    一个青年知识分子，如果在解放前不懂得马克思主义而又接触红楼梦这一题目，在考证方法上就会成为胡、俞二人的俘虏，笔者个人就是一个例子。我在“红楼梦新证”一书中，处处以小说中人物与曹家世系比附，说小说中日期与作者生活实际相合，说小说是“精剪细裁的生活实录”，就是最突出的明证。这固然因为我在从前写书时，主要还是想强调证明鲁迅先生的“写实”“自叙”说，借以摧破当时潜在势力还相当强的索隐说法；可是由于对现实主义的认识有错误，受胡、俞二人的方法影响很深，结果实际上还是导引读者加深对红楼梦的错误认识。不过，把红楼梦的研究由与社会政治结合引向与社会政治分家的道路，却不是我的目标；恰恰相反，我正是想在自己的学识理论的有限水平上，努力找寻红楼梦的社会政治意义，把红楼梦与社会政治更密切地结合起来看问题。我坚决反对把这伟大的古典现实主义小说红楼梦当作某些人麻醉青年的工具和某些人“闹着顽”的无聊对象。
    我们知道，“古典艺术通常是在社会经济制度的矛盾的基础上产生的，但它照例是不为这一制度作辩护的。最卓越的艺术作品，主要是在转变时代，即在与巨大的社会变革有关的时代出现的。因此，古典艺术总是这样或那样反对一切旧的、衰颓的、反动的东西，反对社会上的虚伪和罪恶，反对腐朽的恶劣的风气。”〔注二〕
    因此，研究红楼梦，首先就必须对于曹雪芹时代的社会经济制度的矛盾，对他本人的生活现实，对他的发展了以前的富有现实主义精神的艺术传统的创作方法，对这一创作方法和他的世界观的关系等等，得到比较清楚的认识；否则，对曹雪芹的创作方法和艺术成就进行深刻的学习和研究是不可能的。然而，截至目前为止，我们关于这些问题的了解还极其有限。
    扼要地说，红楼梦的社会政治背景是什么呢？
    我们知道统治阶级内部是有重重矛盾的，封建皇帝立在这些矛盾的尖端，他极需要爪牙耳目，来巩固他的宝座；这些爪牙耳目，一部分就是他最贴近的奴才，而且这些人直接影响当时的政治：明朝的阉官魏忠贤和乳母客氏就是最好的例子。清初有鉴于此，裁抑宦官，设内务府〔注三〕，于是内务府包衣（皇室家奴）就掌握了原来太监执掌的各项执事。曹雪芹的先人，就是满洲包衣。曹寅以康熙乳母的儿子，最获亲信，出掌织造、盐差、漕运。清室收入，除地丁银外，即以盐课为最大宗（岁收约七百五十万两），而两淮盐课是其主项（岁收约三百四十万两）。曹寅等人一年差事仅份内应得即可剩银五六十万两，加上搜刮所得，其数目之大足以惊人。这是统治剥削者的生活面貌之一小部分。
    这样人家自然是统治阶级内部矛盾磨擦的参与者和促成者，于是营私结党，花样多端。我们知道，康熙时代三大朋党，是满官明珠派、汉官徐干学派、皇子胤祀派，三派又是互有关联的。可是曹家一派和这三派都有相当密切的关系。矛盾最后集中体现为诸皇子争位事件。胤祀的死敌胤禛得胜后，屠戮胤祀派备极惨酷。曹家一派亲朋，都连带遭到压力；这派人，普遍对当时政治不满，有的企图颠覆它，还有其他表现为各种样式的积极的和消极的反抗。曹雪芹本人家庭亲戚朋友，就是处在这样的政治环境中。他们的命运是相似而且相连的。
    清代的封建制度结构重重，最下层是汉族人民。满洲人入关以后，大规模强迫圈占近畿一带汉人房地，作为“旗产”，仅皇室庄田、宗室庄田、八旗庄田三项（不计驻防庄田）即达十六七万顷之多；旗人除作官的有薪俸外，还按人发给口粮，六岁以下半粮、以上全粮。这一统治剥削集团，就这样不事生产，游手好闲，鲜衣美食，穷奢极泰；赌博、听戏、唱曲、斗鸡走马、陈列玩器以及千奇百怪的刁钻癖好，就是他们的日常生活。曹家就是这些人家里的一分子，曹雪芹所写的小说暴露了这样人家的生活。
    中国资本主义幼芽已于明末出现，但旋即为清代严重的封建经济所扼煞；鸦片战争以前，整个清代经济是处于严格闭关封建经济停滞的时期。而曹雪芹正是生活在这个时期。他死于乾隆二十八年，即一七六四年二月，下距鸦片战争爆发还有七十多年。就是说，曹雪芹生活于此一巨大历史事件之前整整一世纪。因此，他的作品对封建制度的反抗的程度和反抗的形式也就受着当时历史条件的规定。
    可是，胡适之、俞平伯一派的“红学”家，却竭力企图把红楼梦化为一个小把戏，引导读者钻向琐碎趣味中去，模糊这一伟大古典现实主义名著的深刻意义。研究红楼梦足足三十年的俞平伯，对红楼梦的总的认识是什么呢？我以为是三个字的回答：“不可知”。他在一九五○年十二月给“红楼梦研究”作“自序”时，就教导读者说：
    至于红楼梦本身底疑问，使我每每发生误解的，
    更无从说起。我尝谓这书在中国文坛上是个
    “梦魇”，你越研究便越觉胡涂。（著重点都
    是我加的，下同）（页二）这就是俞平伯对红楼梦研究了整整三十年以后的心得和总结。他因为对于这部小说书名、作者姓名之都有一大串，感到十分困惑，就又说：
    从这一点看，可知红楼梦的的确确不折不扣，
    是第一奇书，像我们这样凡夫，望洋兴叹，从
    何处去下笔呢！（页三）
    所以，俞平伯认为这部第一奇书有一个“根本的难题悬着”，不能解决。什么“根本的难题”呢？他没有说明，我想，该就是使俞平伯“越研究便越觉胡涂”的“不可知”。到一九五三年以来，他的许多新文章的典型代表作品“红楼梦简论”就直承着这一观点，进一步发挥。“简论”的引言说：
    为什么对别的小说都不发生，却对红楼梦便会
    有这样多的附会呢？其中也必有些原故。所以
    了解红楼梦、说明红楼梦都很不容易，在这儿
    好像通了，到那边又会碰壁。
    俞平伯对红楼梦的认识原来就是这样一个玄妙的十足唯心的“不可知论”。他并且把这一心得向对他寄予重大期望的青年读者大肆宣传。
    虽然他在“红楼梦研究”自序里最后表明：
  “我底红楼梦研究也还没有起头呢”，但实际上他是有目的地宣传了他的一套唯心观点。他在“红楼梦的风格”一节里，十分不满于水浒的“过火”，而推尊红楼梦的“温厚”；他“确定了”后者的“怨而不怒”的或“哀思”的“风格”，并说这就是红楼梦胜于一切旧小说的最可贵的特点。我们都知道，
  “乱世之音怨以怒，其政乖；亡国之音哀以思，其民困”是古人说诗的话，原是肯定政乖民困，
  “怨”而且“怒”，可是俞平伯主张“怨”得，“怒”不得，要“温厚”，这正是“小雅怨诽而不乱”
  “温柔敦厚”“止乎礼义”“止僻防邪”的千百年来封建统治者的“诗教”的老调子，防止人民“好乱犯上”的手段。这就无怪俞平伯不满于写农民作“乱”犯“上”的水浒，认为太“过火”了。俞平伯也说“红楼梦是一部极严重的悲剧”，但“悲”在哪里呢？他说得明白：
    不但宁荣两府之由盛而衰，十二钗之由荣而
    悴，能使读者为之怆然雪涕而已。（页一二二）提到巧姐结局，便说：
    这是写凤姐身后的凄凉，是写贾氏末路的光景，
    甚至于赫赫扬扬百年鼎盛的大族，不能荫庇一
    女，反借助于乡村中的老妪。这类文情是何等
    的感慨！（页一五五）此类话头，屡见不一，这如果是曹雪芹的思想还有可说，而这居然是俞平伯的思想，这就可见俞平伯看红楼梦，他的标尺是超阶级的什么“文情”（这字眼他最爱用的，例如反对人痛骂宝钗时，就说：
  “与事实（？）既不符，与文情亦不合”）。以上还可以说是“修改”旧稿未尽“妥当”的地方，但看他真正在一九五○年十月底的文字是如何说：
    凤姐结局很凄惨，令人悲感。（页二一五）
    可见抄没以后，贾氏诸人关进监牢，宝玉凤姐
    都在内。其时奴仆星散，却有昔年被逐之丫环
    犹知慰主，文情凄惋可想而知。（页二二一）多么明白啊！绕说他的“文情”标尺是“超”阶级的，恐怕还不大对头，因为假如俞平伯不是站在封建“主”子一边，如何欣赏赞叹这些知“恩”知
  “义”的奴才的“犹知慰主”呢？俞平伯的阶级立场在这里不是很清楚吗？
    和俞平伯的阶级观点直接联系的就是他的资产阶级的文艺见解，他曾说：
    所以红楼梦在我们文艺界中很有革命的精神。
    他所以能有这样的精神，却不定是有意与社会
    挑战，是由于凭依事实，出于势之不得不然，
    因为窠臼并非事实所有，事实是千变万化，那
    里有一个固定的型式呢？……我以为红楼梦作
    者第一大本领，只是肯说老实话，只是做一面
    公平的镜子。……看去如何平淡，红楼梦却成
    为我们中国过去文艺界中第一部奇书。（页一
    二○）再明白不过：俞平伯否认现实生活的客观规律性，有头脑的作者并不在此客观规律下生活感受，也无意批判社会，只是要给事实做一面无动于衷的“公平的镜子”，作者如何写，都是概不由己“不得不然”。李希凡、蓝翎两人的文章说俞平伯是自然主义不是没有道理的。
    俞平伯自然也否认红楼梦里面反映着任何社会冲突。他虽然一方面承认“公众的意见毕竟是正确的”（红楼梦简论），另一方面却大肆讥笑这些
  “公众”：
    社会上最喜欢有相反的对照。戏台上有一个红
    面孔，必跟着个黑面孔来陪他，所谓“一脸之
    红荣于华衮，一鼻之白严于斧钺”。在小说上
    必有一个忠臣，一个奸臣；…我小时候听人讲
    小说，必很急切地问道：“那个是好人？那个
    是坏人？”觉得这是小说中最重要，并且最精
    采的一点。社会上一般人底读书程度，正还和
    那时候的我差不许多。雪芹先生于是狠狠的对
    他们开一下玩笑。（页一二一）事实上恐怕是俞平伯对有正义感、爱憎分明的古今读者大众狠狠的开了一下玩笑。他们正是要分清好人坏人，“荣于华衮”“严于斧钺”正是他们的最严正的判决。我不知道俞平伯把这一主要社会意义从作品内容中抽出后，要剩些什么给它们。因此他反对人们痛骂宝钗袭人王夫人等一党，进而根据一条脂批，想把钗黛两个正反典型的形象合一，根本抹掉一切社会矛盾，诱导读者专从“情场”上去寻找某些趣味。他说那条批“却特别重要”，对读者 “是个新观点”，要使“三美合一”。
    其实，作为一个考据家来说，俞平伯在这方面也是不老实的。甲戌本二十八回末总评下一条说：
    倘若三人一体，固是美事，但又非石头记之本
    意也。可见连那时的批者也知道这是与红楼梦的意义不合的。俞平伯不从封建制度本身的矛盾上去体认钗黛两个对照形象的社会意义，只从“情场”“文情”上去寻趣味，那就无怪他说：
  且书中钗黛每每并提，若两峰对峙双水分流，
    各极其妙莫能相下，必如此方极情场之盛，必
  如此方尽文章之妙。若宝钗稀糟，黛玉又岂有
    身分之可言。与事实既不符，与文情亦不合，
    雪芹何所取而非如此做不可呢？（页一一二）事情最清楚：原来在俞平伯眼里，红楼梦和后来资产阶级作家写“情场”上“三角”“五角”的那些“恋爱”小说的“文情”是并无本质区别的。既然如此，也就无怪俞平伯不能了解“雪芹何所取而非如此做不可”了。
    我觉得俞平伯这种观点和他自己提出的“进一步用马克思列宁主义的文艺理论来分析它”的口号毫无共通之点，因此，我们说俞平伯的文学见解完全从唯心论思想出发，是有理由的。
    为什么俞平伯说已经懂得要用马克思列宁主义文艺理论来对待红楼梦的时候，反而极力高唱起红楼梦的“不可知论”来了呢？我以为，这可能反映了俞平伯的唯心论思想和新事物和马克思列宁主义正面接触的一个具体矛盾。俞平伯虽然一方面因为大家都学习马克思列宁主义，不能不接触马克思列宁主义文艺理论，可是另一方面马克思列宁主义文艺理论与他的唯心论见解处处不对头，因此，他就宣扬起“不可知论”来了。
    我们应该肃清资产阶级的错误思想，脚踏实地的循着正确的途径继续探讨和红楼梦有关的许多问题，并为古典文学遗产的研究工作开辟更广远更辉煌的道路。〔注一〕鲁迅先生原据“随园诗话”定“自叙”
