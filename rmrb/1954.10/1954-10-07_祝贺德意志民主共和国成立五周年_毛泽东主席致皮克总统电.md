    Congratulating the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the German Democratic Republic
    Chairman Mao Zedong's Telegram to President Pieck
    To Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic,

    Respected Comrade President:

    On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, I extend to the German Democratic Republic, the peace-loving people of all Germany, and to you, on behalf of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and in my own name, my sincere and warm congratulations.

    Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and yourself, and with the sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union, the people of the German Democratic Republic have achieved brilliant successes both in consolidating the people's democratic regime, developing the national economy, and improving the people's livelihood. Over the past five years, the German Democratic Republic has united all progressive and patriotic forces among the German people, waged an indomitable struggle to strive for a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany, to establish European collective security, and to safeguard world peace, and has won the warm support of peace-loving people in Europe and around the world. These achievements and efforts of the German Democratic Republic have encouraged all peace-loving German people and strengthened their confidence in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of Germany.

    The fraternal friendship and close economic and cultural cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are developing more and more. The just cause of the German people to strive for the establishment of a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany has received the deep sympathy of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. The communiqué of the talks between the Premier of our country and the Premier of the German Democratic Republic on July 25, 1954, demonstrated the mutual concern and support between our two peoples in the great cause of peace.

    Comrade President, I wish you greater achievements in leading the German people in the great struggle to realize the unification of their motherland and to defend world peace, and I wish you good health!

    Chairman of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong
          October 5, 1954
