The Marxist-Leninist doctrine teaches us that capitalist relations of production are a temporary historical form of social production; the revolutionary replacement of capitalism by a more progressive social system—socialism—is inevitable.

However, between the abolition of the capitalist system and the construction of a new socialist system lies an entire historical period—the transition period.

In the Soviet Union, this transition period, from the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution to the complete construction of socialism, lasted nearly twenty years. During these years, until the elimination of the rich peasants (kulaks), a numerous exploiting class in the country, a stubborn struggle was waged between capitalism and socialism, and as a result of this struggle, the socialist system gained a dominant position.

The transition period in each country has its historical characteristics, which are determined by the conditions under which the revolution was completed and the conditions for socialist construction. For example, in the Soviet Union, this period had the following characteristics: First, the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country achieved complete victory in the form of Soviets, which was most suitable for the tasks of the proletariat at that time. Second, the victory of our socialist revolution was achieved under conditions of hostile capitalist encirclement. The Soviet Union had to open up the road to socialism by its own strength, in the absence of any experience, under the threat of capitalist encirclement and open counter-revolutionary activities. Third, the victory of this socialist revolution was achieved in an economically backward country, that is, a country where small-scale commodity agricultural economy was dominant. In addition, the First World War and the subsequent civil war had destroyed our national economy and further weakened our economy.

All these conditions hindered the progress of socialist construction during the transition period. If there had been more favorable conditions, the transition period in the Soviet Union could have been greatly shortened.

Until the implementation of complete collectivization, the characteristic of the Soviet economy during the transition period was its multi-component nature. At the beginning of the transition period, there were five socio-economic components in the country.

The first component: patriarchal, that is, largely primitive peasant economy.

The second component: small-scale commodity production. This included the majority of farmers who sold grain.

The third component: private capitalism. This refers to various private capitalist enterprises in urban and rural areas, including the rich peasant (kulak) economy.

The fourth component: state capitalism. This refers to capitalist enterprises that operate under contract with the proletarian state.

The fifth component: socialism. This includes state-owned industrial, transportation, and trade enterprises, post and telecommunications, the monetary and credit system, state farms, machine tractor stations, and collective farms.

However, not all of these components exist in the transition period of every country. Lenin believed that any country in the transition period usually has three economic components: the socialist component, the small-scale commodity component, and the private capitalist component closely related to it.

During the transition period, the Soviet economy had both capitalist and socialist components. They struggled against each other according to the formula "who will defeat whom." Although there was a danger of capitalist restoration, the objective possibility of socialist victory was created because all the economic lifelines—large industrial enterprises, banks, railways, transportation, etc.—were in the hands of the working class, and because the working class had a powerful ally—the peasantry.

The leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, V.I. Lenin, formulated a scientifically based program to transform backward Russia into an advanced socialist power. As early as the beginning of 1918, Lenin made a brilliant exposition of the principles of the New Economic Policy in his work "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government."

However, foreign armed intervention and the civil war interrupted the implementation of this policy. In order to mobilize all forces to fight against domestic counter-revolution and foreign armed intervention, the Soviet state was forced to implement the policy of war communism. The Soviet regime nationalized all industries, including small and medium-sized industries, and placed them under the supervision of the Soviet regime. In order to calculate all surplus grain and store grain to supply the cities and the army, the surplus grain requisition system was implemented.

During the period of war communism, the worker-peasant alliance had a military and political character. That is to say, the state obtained grain and other food from the peasants based on the surplus grain requisition system to supply the workers and the army, while the peasants obtained land from the landlords and rich peasants and were guaranteed protection from the oppression of landlords and rich peasants.

The policy of war communism played a huge historical role in the civil war. Without this policy, the Soviet Republic could not have achieved victory. However, it must be emphasized that war communism is not an economically necessary stage in the development of the proletarian revolution in any country.

After the victorious conclusion of the civil war, the Soviet state was able to begin peaceful economic construction based on the program formulated by V.I. Lenin. This program stipulated the implementation of state socialist industrialization, the development of heavy industry in every possible way, the electrification of the entire national economy, the cooperative plan for transforming agriculture according to socialist principles, and the implementation of a cultural revolution.

With the end of the war, the policy of war communism could no longer meet the fundamental interests of the working people. The old form of the worker-peasant alliance implemented during the years of foreign armed intervention was no longer adapted to the new conditions. Landlords, capitalists, and foreign armed interventionists had been eliminated, and the peasants' use of land was no longer threatened. Now the peasants hoped to freely dispose of their own products, but they did not have this possibility when the system of war communism still existed. The peasants lost interest in further expanding cultivated land and improving their agricultural management, which inevitably led to a shortage of grain in the country, leading to the decline of industry and transportation, and would destroy the worker-peasant alliance. In order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and create conditions for the recovery and further development of the national economy, it was necessary to transform from the form of military-political alliance to the form of economic alliance, in order to protect both the interests of the workers and the interests of the peasants.

In March 1921, the Tenth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party was convened. The Congress passed a historic resolution on the transition to the New Economic Policy—that is, the transition to a new policy that was newer than the policy of war communism.

The New Economic Policy went through several stages in its development. Its first stage started in 1921 and lasted until the transition to the policy of state industrialization in 1925. This period mainly focused on developing agriculture as the basis for restoring the entire national economy.

Replacing the surplus grain requisition system with a grain tax was the first step in implementing the New Economic Policy, because the surplus grain requisition system could no longer promote the improvement of agricultural production.

The amount of the grain tax was announced before spring sowing. The amount of the grain tax was about half less than that of the surplus grain requisition system. For example, the amount of the grain tax for 1921 to 1922 was set at 240 million poods of grain, while according to the surplus grain requisition system, 423 million poods of grain should have been collected in 1920 to 1921. The quantity of agricultural products collected has been greatly reduced.

The grain tax was formulated according to the principle of progressive taxation, while taking into account the economic strength of each farm household. According to this principle, rich peasants and wealthy farmers were levied higher taxes, while middle peasants were completely exempt from the grain tax. The indicators of the financial strength and income of the farmers were: the amount of cultivated land, the number of people, and the amount of harvest. Levying lower taxes on the middle peasants, who accounted for the majority of the agricultural population at that time, promoted the rapid improvement of agriculture and greatly improved the situation of the middle peasants.

The grain tax in 1921 was levied in kind according to several agricultural products—grain, potatoes, oilseeds, meat, and wool, etc. This hindered the increase of commodity products and the increase of commodity turnover in individual sectors of agriculture. Therefore, in 1922, a special directive was passed on the transition to levying a unified tax in kind on agricultural products. In this regard, it was also stipulated that the livestock raised should be used as a supplementary indicator to determine the financial strength of the farm household.

Later, in order to develop commodity circulation and stabilize the ruble, and to allow farmers to dispose of their products more freely, the unified agricultural tax was gradually changed from taxation in kind to taxation in currency.

The difference between the grain tax and the surplus grain requisition system is that it only levies a part of the surplus agricultural products for the state. After paying the grain tax, the peasants were completely free to dispose of the remaining grain. This increased the peasants' interest in managing and increasing production. Now, the peasants could freely buy and sell grain and other agricultural products.

Lenin believed that trade was the main condition for establishing the alliance between urban and rural areas and building the foundation of socialism.

Allowing free trade will activate the capitalist component. But this is not dangerous, because the dictatorship of the working class has won victory in our country, and the economic lifeline is in the hands of the proletarian state. In addition, private trade is only limited to a small scope and is regulated by the state.

Under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, with the freedom of private trade allowed, cooperatives were of great importance, because they were best able to combine the interests of peasants' private trade with the interests of establishing a socialist economic foundation. At that time, cooperatives had become a major tool in the struggle against capitalism. Based on Lenin's cooperative plan, the peasants voluntarily united into consumer cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and finally into production cooperatives.

The New Economic Policy created conditions for the rapid improvement of all sectors of the Soviet national economy. For example: in 1920, agricultural products were 50% of the pre-war level, and industrial products only reached 14% of the pre-war level, while in the 1924-1925 economic year, agriculture was close to the pre-war scale, and large industry was almost able to produce three-quarters of the pre-war industrial products. The plan for national electrification has been successfully completed.

The economic upsurge helped improve the situation of workers and peasants, thereby greatly consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

However, for a country that is building socialism, it is not enough to only reach the pre-war level, it must move forward further.

Lenin repeatedly pointed out that large-scale industry built on the latest technical equipment and capable of reorganizing the entire national economy is the effective and only solid foundation for building a socialist society. It is impossible to build a socialist society without reorganizing the various economic sectors on an advanced technical basis. The necessity of implementing state industrialization lies here.

The Fourteenth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, held in December 1925, adopted the firm policy of state socialist industrialization.

With the transition to the policy of industrialization, the Soviet state entered the second stage of the New Economic Policy, which lasted until the overall socialist offensive.

State industrialization laid the foundation for the development of socialist components and created conditions for the complete elimination of capitalist components. Implementing socialist industrialization first and foremost means developing heavy industry and its core—the machinery industry. The machinery industry is the key to implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture and creating the victory of the collective farm system, a new productive force. Socialist industrialization increased the number of the working class, strengthened its leading role in domestic life, increasingly consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidated the friendship of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. Due to the successful implementation of the industrialization policy, the contradiction between the world's most advanced political system produced by the Great October Revolution and our country's technical and economic backwardness was overcome.

Under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, state industrialization guaranteed the rapid development of the entire national economy. By the end of 1927, the total output of Soviet industry and agriculture had exceeded the pre-war level. From 1929 to 1937, industrial production in our country rose by an average of about 20% per year, while industrial production in capitalist countries at that time rose by an average of only 0.3% per year. The development of industry was generated through the growth of socialist components.

The proportion of socialist components in industrial output increased from 81% in 1924-1925 to 86% in 1926-1927.

During the years of the first Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development, 1,500 industrial enterprises were built and put into production, while during the second Five-Year Plan period, 4,500 industrial enterprises were built and put into production.

The developed socialist industry has massively supplied agriculture with tractors, combine harvesters, and other machines. The task of the Soviet state was to transform agriculture on a socialist basis. This was mainly because the individual small-scale peasant economy hindered the adoption of agricultural machinery and the most advanced agronomic achievements. In other words, the old production relations that existed in the countryside at that time could no longer adapt to the new productive forces. This violated the requirement of the economic law that production relations must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces. The task of the party was to eliminate this incompatibility.

In 1929, a fundamental shift occurred in the peasants' participation in collective farms. At that time, the middle peasants, who were the basic masses of the peasants, all participated in the collective farms. The collectivization in the Soviet Union was carried out in strict adherence to the principle of voluntariness and taking into account the economic and cultural development conditions of various regions.

As a result of collectivization, the Soviet Union transformed from a country of small-scale peasant economy into the largest country of mechanized agriculture. The productive forces gained full and broad space to develop themselves, the socialist economy embarked on a path of rapid upsurge, guaranteeing a prosperous and civilized life in the countryside, and supplying the cities with food and raw materials.

The last stage of the New Economic Policy, which ended with the complete victory of socialism, began in 1930. State industrialization and the collectivization of agricultural production turned the Soviet Union into a powerful socialist country. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people achieved the complete victory of the socialist system in all areas of the national economy. The victory of socialism means that the unified socialist component occupies a dominant position in our country, the transition period from capitalism to socialism has ended, and the New Economic Policy has also ended.

The New Economic Policy adopted during the transition period from capitalism to socialism is not only a Russian phenomenon. It has great international significance. The issue of building socialism is now facing the democratic camp countries. Starting from this issue, the issue of the interrelationship between industry and agriculture, the working class and the peasants arises. The New Economic Policy is pointing the way to correctly solve this important issue of socialist construction.

    苏联新经济政策的基本原则
    苏联经济学硕士  纳·奥兹洛宾
    马克思列宁主义教导我们，资本主义的生产关系是社会生产的一个暂时的历史形式；用更加进步的社会制度——社会主义代替资本主义的革命更替，乃是不可避免的。
    但是，从资本主义制度的消灭到建成新的社会主义制度，中间还横着一整个历史时期——过渡时期。
    在苏联，这个过渡时期，从伟大十月社会主义革命胜利开始到完全建成社会主义，延长几达二十年。在这些年代里，一直到把国内富农这个人数众多的剥削阶级消灭为止，在资本主义和社会主义之间曾进行了顽强的斗争，这个斗争的结果使社会主义制度取得了独占的统治地位。
    每一个国家的过渡时期都具有它的历史特点，这些特点是由完成革命时的条件和进行社会主义建设的条件决定的。例如，在苏联这个时期具有以下特点：第一，我国无产阶级专政是以苏维埃的形式取得完全胜利的，这个形式最适合于当时无产阶级的任务。第二，我国社会主义革命的胜利是在敌对的资本主义包围的情况下完成的。苏联曾不得不在缺乏任何经验的条件下，在资本主义包围的威胁和公开反革命活动的情况下以自身的力量来开辟走向社会主义的道路。第三，这个社会主义革命的胜利是在一个经济上落后的国家、即小商品农业经济占优势的国家完成的。加之，第一次世界大战和随后的国内战争曾使我国国民经济遭到破坏，并更加削弱了我国的经济。
    所有这些条件都阻碍了过渡时期社会主义建设的进程。如果有比较顺利的条件，苏联的过渡时期是可以大大地缩短的。
    一直到实行全部集体化为止，苏联过渡时期经济的特点是它的多种成份性。过渡时期开始的时候国内有五种社会经济成份。
    第一种成份：宗法式的，即颇大程度上是原始式的农民经济。
    第二种成份：小商品生产。其中包括大多数出卖粮食的农民。
    第三种成份：私人资本主义。这是指城乡各种私人资本主义企业，其中也包括富农经济。
    第四种成份：国家资本主义。即指与无产阶级国家订立契约进行经营的资本主义企业。
    第五种成份：社会主义。这里包括国营工业、运输、贸易企业、邮电、货币信贷制度、国营农场、机器拖拉机站和集体农庄。
    但是这些成份并不是在每一个国家的过渡时期中都有的。列宁认为：任何一个国家在过渡时期通常都会有三种经济成份：即社会主义成份，小商品成份及与其密切联系的私人资本主义成份。
    在过渡时期中，苏联的经济既有资本主义成份，也有社会主义成份。它们之间按照“谁战胜谁”的公式进行了斗争。虽然也有资本主义复辟的危险，但是由于一切经济命脉：大工业企业、银行、铁路、交通等都已为工人阶级所掌握，由于工人阶级有强大的同盟者——农民，这就创造了社会主义胜利的客观可能性。
    共产党和苏维埃国家的领袖乌·伊·列宁制定有了科学根据的、把落后的俄国变为先进的社会主义强国的纲领。还在一九一八年初，列宁就在他的著作“苏维埃政权的当前任务”中作了新经济政策原理的天才论证。
    但是外国武装干涉和国内战争中断了这个政策的实行。苏维埃国家为了动员一切力量与国内反革命和外国武装干涉作斗争被迫实行了战时共产主义政策。苏维埃政权把全部工业、包括中小工业，收归国有并将它们置于苏维埃政权的监督下。为了计算全部余粮并贮备谷物以供应城市和军队，实行了余粮收集制。
    在战时共产主义时期中工农联盟具有军事和政治的性质。这就是说，国家根据余粮收集制从农民那里取得谷物和其他粮食以供应工人和军队，而农民则从地主和富农手中取得土地并获得免受地主和富农压迫的保障。
    在国内战争中战时共产主义政策起了巨大的历史作用，没有这个政策，苏维埃共和国就不能取得胜利。但是必须着重指出：战时共产主义并不是任何国家的无产阶级革命发展中经济上所必经的阶段。
    国内战争胜利结束以后，苏维埃国家已有可能根据弗·伊·列宁所制定的纲领来着手进行和平的经济建设。这个纲领规定了实行国家社会主义工业化，用一切方法发展重工业，使全部国民经济电气化，按照社会主义原则改造农业的合作社计划，并实行文化革命。
    随着战争的结束，战时共产主义政策已经不能满足劳动人民的根本利益。在外国武装干涉年代中实行的工农联盟的旧形式已不能适应新的条件。地主、资本家和外国武装干涉者已被消灭，而农民对土地的使用已不会受到威胁。现在农民希望自由地处理自己的生产品，但是当战时共产主义制度还存在的时候，他们是没有这种可能的。农民失掉了进一步扩大耕地、提高自己的农业经营的兴趣，这就不可避免地引起国内粮食的缺乏，导致工业和运输业的衰退，并会破坏工农联盟。为了巩固工农联盟、并为恢复和进一步发展国民经济创造条件，就必须从军事政治联盟的形式转变到经济联盟的形式，以便既保障工人的利益也保障农民的利益。
    一九二一年三月召开了苏联共产党第十次代表大会。代表大会通过了关于过渡到新经济政策——即过渡到较之战时共产主义政策为新的政策——的历史性决议。
    新经济政策在它的发展过程中经过了几个阶段。它的第一阶段从一九二一年开始直到一九二五年的过渡到国家工业化政策为止。这个时期主要是集中精力发展农业，把它作为恢复全部国民经济的基础。
    以粮食税代替余粮收集制是实现新经济政策的第一步，因为余粮收集制已不能促进农业生产的提高。
    粮食税额是在春种以前公布。粮食税的税额大约比余粮收集制少一半。例如一九二一年到一九二二年的粮食税的税额规定为二亿四千万普特谷物，而按照余粮收集制在一九二○年到一九二一年则应该收四亿二千三百万普特的谷物。被征收的农产品数量已大大减少。
    粮食税是按照累进税的原则制定的，同时考虑到每一农户的经济力量。按照这个原则，对富农和富裕农户就课以较高的税，中农则完全免去粮食税。农户财力和收入的指标是：耕地数量、人口数量和收获数量。对当时在农业人口中占多数的中农征收较少的税，促进了农业的迅速提高并大大改善了中农的境况。
    一九二一年的粮食税是按照几种农产品——谷物、马铃薯、含油种籽、肉类和毛类等——征收实物的。这就阻碍了农业个别部门的商品产品的增加和商品流转额的提高。因此在一九二二年又通过了关于转向对农产品征收统一的实物税的特别指令。在这方面还规定了把所饲养的牲畜作为确定农户财力的补充指标。
    后来，为了发展商品流转和稳定卢布、并使农民更自由地处理自己的产品，曾实行了从实物税逐步变为按货币征收的统一的农业税。
    粮食税与余粮收集制不同之点就在于它只为国家征收剩余农产品的一部分。农民在缴纳粮食税以后可以完全自由支配其余的粮食。这就提高了农民经营和增产的兴趣。现在，农民已可以自由地买卖谷物和其他农产品了。
    列宁曾认为贸易是建立城乡联合和建设社会主义基础的主要条件。
    容许自由贸易就会使资本主义成份活跃起来。但是这并没有什么危险，因为工人阶级专政在我国已取得胜利，而且经济命脉是掌握在无产阶级国家手里。此外，私人贸易也仅限于在不大的范围内，并且是由国家来调节的。
    在新经济政策的条件下，在允许私人贸易自由的情况下，合作社具有非常重要的意义，因为它最能够使农民私人贸易的利益同建立社会主义经济基础的利益接合起来。当时，合作社已成为与资本主义作斗争的一个主要工具。在列宁合作社计划的基础上，农民们自愿地联合到消费合作社、供销合作社、最后是联合到生产合作社中去。
    新经济政策为苏联国民经济各部门的迅速提高创造了条件。例如：一九二○年的农产品为战前水平的百分之五十，工业产品只达到战前的百分之十四，而在一九二四—一九二五年经济年度内农业已接近战前的规模，而大工业则几乎已能生产战前工业产品的四分之三。国家电气化的计划已胜利完成。
    经济的高涨帮助改进了工农的境况，从而也大大地巩固了工农联盟。
    但是，对于正在建设社会主义的国家来说，只达到战前的水平是不够的，必须更向前进展。
    列宁曾一再指出：建立在最新技术设备上并能够改组整个国民经济的大工业，是建设社会主义社会的有效的唯一的稳固基础。不在先进的技术基础上改组各经济部门就不可能建成社会主义社会。实行国家工业化的必要性，原因也正在这里。
    一九二五年十二月召开的苏联共产党第十四次代表大会采取了国家社会主义工业化的坚定方针。
    随着过渡到工业化政策，苏维埃国家就进入了新经济政策的第二阶段，这个阶段到社会主义的全面进攻为止。
    国家工业化为发展社会主义成份奠定了基础，并为完全消灭资本主义成份创造了条件。实行社会主义工业化首先就是指要发展重工业及其核心——机械工业。而机械工业则是对农业实行社会主义改造、创造集体农庄制度取得胜利所必需的新的生产力的关键。社会主义工业化使工人阶级的人数增加、使它在国内生活中的领导作用加强、使工农联盟日益巩固、并使苏联各族人民的友谊巩固起来。由于顺利地实现了工业化政策，从而克服了由伟大的十月革命所产生的世界上最先进的政治制度同我国在技术和经济上的落后现象二者之间的矛盾。
    在新经济政策的条件下，国家工业化曾保证了整个国民经济的迅速发展。到一九二七年底，苏维埃的工业和农业就其总产量来说，已超过战前水平。从一九二九—一九三七年，我国工业生产平均每年约上升百分之二十，而当时资本主义国家的工业生产平均每年只上升百分之○·三。工业的发展是通过社会主义成份的增长而产生的。
    社会主义成份在工业品出产量中的比重从一九二四—一九二五年度的百分之八十一增加到一九二六—一九二七年的百分之八十六。
    在第一个国民经济五年计划的年代里，建立和投入生产的有一千五百个工业企业，而在第二个五年计划时期中，建立和投入生产的则有四千五百个工业企业。
    发展起来的社会主义工业曾大规模地以拖拉机、收割联合机和其他机器供应农业。苏维埃国家的任务就是要在社会主义的基础上改造农业。这主要是因为个体小农经济阻碍了对农业机器和最先进的农艺学成就的采用。换句话说，就是当时在农村中所存在的旧的生产关系已不能适应新的生产力。这就违背了生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的经济法则的要求。党的任务就是要消除这种不相适应的现象。
    一九二九年发生了农民参加集体农庄的根本转变。当时作为农民的基本群众的中农都参加了集体农庄。苏联的集体化是在严格遵守自愿原则并估计各个不同地区经济和文化发展的条件而进行的。
    集体化的结果，使苏联由一个小农经济的国家变为最大的机械化农业的国家。生产力获得了发展自己的充分的广阔场所，社会主义经济走上了急剧高涨的道路，保证了农村的富裕的、文明的生活，并以粮食和原料供给了城市。
    以社会主义完全胜利而结束的新经济政策的最后一个阶段是从一九三○年开始的。国家工业化和农业生产集体化把苏联变成了一个强大的社会主义国家。苏联人民在共产党领导下取得了社会主义制度在国民经济各个领域的完全胜利。社会主义的胜利就是指统一的社会主义成份在我国居于统治地位，从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期已经结束，而新经济政策也结束了。
    从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期所采取的新经济政策不仅是俄国的现象。它具有巨大的国际意义。建设社会主义的问题正摆在民主阵营各国的面前。从这一问题出发，就发生关于工业和农业、工人阶级和农民的相互关系问题。新经济政策正为正确解决这个社会主义建设的重要问题指出道路。
