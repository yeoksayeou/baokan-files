On the Conclusion of an International Convention on the Reduction of Armaments, the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction

Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen:

At the commencement of the General Assembly, it is customary to engage in a general debate, allowing each delegation to express its views on the most important issues that it believes the Assembly should pay the greatest attention to. Some delegations have already taken advantage of this opportunity, and among them, there are those who have attempted to analyze the current international situation, assess the role of the United Nations in these events, and try to explain the historical prospects of the major events facing the United Nations and the world. However, many representatives, while noting that the agenda of the ninth session includes some issues that have been discussed in previous sessions and classifying these issues as "perennial plants" using the best botanical methods, do not dare to explain this phenomenon, and even if some attempt to explain it, in our view, their efforts cannot be considered successful. Their analysis of world events is naturally not something that can be pleasing to the eye. Because the historical process is described as a random pile of facts, while the causes of these facts are the mischievous actions of some people who, for some representatives here, try to disrupt world order and, with their reckless methods, force the reasonable and good representatives of other countries to engage in the work of expanding armaments, stockpiling atomic and hydrogen bombs, forming new blocs, building bases on the territory of other peoples, and drafting new plans for world war, etc. Naturally, such an explanation of the development of world affairs is completely inconsistent with the true process of social historical development. In fact, those who hold such ideas see only the trees and not the forest. They do not see the laws at work in the historical development process. And if one observes things from such a principle, one can not only correctly estimate the significance of world events—such as the current national liberation movements sweeping across Asia—but also determine the position and strategy of the United Nations, which should pre-determine the plans for the actions and measures of the United Nations on these events.

It is also impossible to ignore the fact that some people have attempted to lavishly praise the past work of the United Nations, although this attempt is contrary to the well-known facts. These facts show that, as an international organization that should maintain international peace and security, the United Nations has played a regrettable role on many occasions. The United Nations organization has violated its duty to act on the basis of justice and international law as required by the United Nations Charter, thereby damaging its international prestige. Loyalty to the principles of the United Nations and the United Nations Charter is the fundamental condition for the success of the United Nations' work.

Mr. Dulles said in his speech on September 23 that the American people sincerely believe in the purposes and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter. We do not doubt that the American people sincerely believe in the purposes and principles of the United Nations. However, the American people have little to do with these issues, while those Americans who are involved in the work of the United Nations often disregard the principles of this organization, violate these principles, and are far removed from the purposes of the United Nations. Is it not enough to prove this by the fact that the issue of inviting the People's Republic of China to enjoy its lawful seat in the United Nations has been repeated year after year, and today it has been several sessions? The position taken by the United States on this issue is illegal and violates the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. Those delegations that support the United States' position stubbornly oppose the restoration of the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, which proves that these delegations are not willing to act according to the needs of loyalty to the principles of the United Nations. We will continue to point out the abnormal nature of this situation. The demand to stop obstructing the People's Republic of China from enjoying its lawful seat in the United Nations is legal. We are convinced that this legal demand should be satisfied. We are convinced that the participation of the representatives of the Chinese government in our work will make a significant contribution to the efforts of some countries in the United Nations, whose goal in the United Nations is to maintain peace and solve economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian international problems on the basis of international cooperation.

Among these tasks, there are some extremely important tasks, the completion of which will help to avoid the danger of a new world war and strengthen world peace. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to take a variety of measures, including some extremely important measures, such as the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and the elimination of these weapons from the armaments of various countries, the significant reduction of armaments, and the supervision of the implementation of these and some other decisions. The Assembly's adoption of agreed decisions on these important issues will undoubtedly have a very beneficial effect on further easing international tensions and improving relations between countries.

The Soviet Union is convinced that as long as the principles of sovereign equality of states and non-interference in internal affairs are observed, and as long as states respect each other's rights and interests and fulfill their international obligations, it is completely possible to reach agreements on unresolved issues in the interests of peace and international security. If this is the case, the prospects for solving unresolved international problems will be quite realistic. We have no doubt about this. We believe that such prospects are realistic mainly because we believe that the peoples of the world care about peace and international cooperation and are willing to develop peaceful international relations. Our confidence is based on Lenin's theory that countries with different political systems can coexist peacefully.

The Soviet Union has been striving for nearly forty years to maintain good-neighborly relations with many countries, despite their different political systems; this fact proves this confidence. There have often been attempts to belittle the importance of the principle of peaceful coexistence. For example, Mr. Dulles, in a speech delivered in Williamsburg on May 15, 1954, groundlessly said: "Coexistence is not a part of the doctrine or practice of the Soviet Communist Party, except in the sense that it allows the physical existence of non-Communists." The representative of Chile, on the other hand, considers the coexistence issue to be merely a slogan of an aggressor's propaganda machine, as he put it. These statements are absolutely groundless. To prove this, one can cite countless facts, but it is enough to recall the following fact: as early as 1922, Lenin, in a conversation with a correspondent from the "Observer" and the "Manchester Guardian," spoke of the possibility of restoring diplomatic relations between the Russian Republic and capitalist countries—especially Britain—on the basis of economic interests, saying: "...We believe that the establishment of completely friendly relations with the two countries (he referred to Britain and France) is quite possible and is our goal...We believe that the interests of Britain and France, if correctly understood, are also acting in the same direction."

The question at the time was: can one imagine a socialist republic existing in a capitalist encirclement? In reply to this question, the great founder of the Soviet state, Lenin, said: "At first glance, it seems impossible in both political and military terms. But it has been proven that it is possible in both political and military terms, and this is a fact. But what about commerce? What about economic exchange? Is it possible to establish relations, assistance, and exchange of services between backward, riddled with holes, agrarian Russia and a group of advanced, industrially rich capitalist countries? They have talked about it, roared about it, and even tried to strengthen their words with considerable action. But even then, life convincingly proved that all efforts to ignore the importance of political and economic relations between the Soviet Republic and other countries of the Western world have failed. The Western countries had to admit that, despite their different political systems, there is still the possibility of coexistence.

As for the Soviet Union, it has consistently adhered to this position, as it has always done. All subsequent developments in the relations between the Soviet Union and the capitalist world have confirmed the importance, reality, and necessity of the principle of coexistence. Currently, only the most reactionary elements in the West continue to refuse to acknowledge this important principle, which has great practical significance and has always played an important role in the development of normal international relations and will continue to do so in the future.

The Soviet government, on the one hand, is concentrating all its efforts on the rapid development of peaceful economic construction within the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, it is taking all necessary measures to ensure the normal development of political relations with other countries and the normalization of international relations.

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, G.M. Malenkov, said at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR: "We have always pursued a policy of peace and strengthening international cooperation."

This is the basis and purpose of Soviet foreign policy.

In domestic policy, the Soviet Union has been striving to continuously develop our national economy, improve the material and cultural level of the Soviet people and the entire Soviet society. A large part of the budget is spent on the development of industrial production, agriculture, trade, and transportation. Billions of rubles are allocated for social and cultural measures: universal education, training of workers, development of science and art, social insurance, pensions, family allowances, and maternity benefits, etc.

This year, the expenditure on culture and public utilities in the Soviet budget is 40% higher than the defense allocation, which accounts for 17.8% of the budget, or 2.6% less than last year. Such a policy excludes the possibility of defense allocations occupying a dominant position in the Soviet budget, let alone measures related to the expansion of armaments, the establishment of military bases on foreign territory, or the formation of military blocs.

The Soviet Union is opposed in principle and practice to the policy of implementing these measures. This is also the reason why the Soviet Union has consistently and unwaveringly sought to prohibit atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, prohibit war propaganda, and significantly reduce armaments and armed forces. The Soviet Union is convinced that only a policy based on the above principles can strengthen international trust and cooperation and end the division of the world into hostile camps. On this point, we cannot fail to mention what Molotov said in his statement on the results of the Berlin Conference:

"We hope that in the matter of defending peace, there will be no division into two camps, either in Europe or in the world. We call on all European countries to reject the establishment of mutually opposed military blocs, because the establishment of such blocs cannot but lead to war. We propose that a single bloc be formed by all European countries that are willing to guarantee their security and strengthen European peace." This applies to all countries in the world.

Starting from the premise that if peace is to be maintained, a single bloc must be formed, the Soviet government has always opposed and continues to oppose the formation of separate, narrow blocs of some countries, such as the "European Defense Community," which places itself in a hostile position to other countries and is merely a military bloc with obvious aggressive intentions. This situation is contrary to the basic principles of international law and international intercourse on which Soviet foreign policy is based.

Where these principles are applied, there will be peaceful friendship and cooperation between the peoples of the various countries that help to strengthen international trust and mutual respect, and help to consolidate world peace and international security. On this point, we cannot fail to mention the five principles that were established as the basis for relations between India, the People's Republic of China, and Burma after their talks in Delhi and Rangoon in June. These principles are: mutual respect for territorial sovereignty; non-aggression; non-interference in internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; peaceful coexistence.

We warmly welcome these principles.

This session of the Assembly is being held at a time when international tensions have eased to some extent after the end of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina. Undoubtedly, 1954 began under the sign of easing international tensions. This is mainly due to the Berlin Four-Power Conference, especially the conference of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, with the participation of representatives of other countries, held in Geneva. Although no greater achievements were made at the Berlin Conference, the little that was achieved also has great international significance. The main thing is: the Berlin Conference broke down the obstacles that hindered the four powers from holding talks and paved the way for the Geneva Conference. Another merit of the Berlin Conference is that it made it clearer than ever the connection between the solution of problems such as the German problem and the solution of the problem of guaranteeing European security.

These problems are undoubtedly of great international significance, so it is especially important to clearly and correctly determine the ways to solve these problems. However, no such ways were proposed in the speech of the U.S. Secretary of State on September 23. His few hasty and superficial words on this issue are purely narrative and are a temporary patchwork of words that are contrary to the facts and cannot be considered in the discussion of the ways and means of solving these problems.

In discussing the German problem, Mr. Dulles said: "The continuation of the divided state of Germany cannot but bring serious dangers."

This is something that everyone will agree with. But where is the real danger? Is it not in the fact that instead of restoring a united Germany led by a single government, as the Soviet Union has proposed, efforts are being made to revive Germany as a militaristic country led by revanchists like Field Marshal Keitel? Such a solution to the German problem breeds serious dangers—it will revive the militaristic and aggressive forces that have continued to exist in West Germany since the end of the Second World War, and these forces will pave the way for a new war against the interests of all the peoples of Europe and the German people themselves. This is the true source of the threat to Europe, and not only to Europe, but also to other parts of the world. In discussing the German problem, Mr. Dulles tried to present the matter as if the Soviet proposal would deepen Germany's "dangerous division." This argument is groundless. On the contrary, it is the proposals of the Western countries that cannot help to unite Germany into a peaceful, democratic, independent country, but can only prolong the state of Germany's division.

Therefore, the Soviet Union has been so resolute and consistent in reminding Europe and the world to be on guard against the threat from this side, from the den of fascists who are waiting for the moment to launch a new war, waiting for the signal of the Prussian-German military department led by the greedy and bloodthirsty monopolists of the Rhine and Ruhr. Such a thing must not be allowed to happen. We cannot allow history to repeat itself; we cannot let our descendants experience another bloody tragedy of war.

Mr. Dulles also said: "Due to the recent failure of the implementation of the European Defense Community, the problem of European peace has become even more complicated." This argument is also groundless. It is the imposition of the "European Defense Community" treaty on Europe that will make the problem of European peace complicated, because the "European Defense Community" is a clear threat to the security of the European peoples. The European peoples are too well aware of this, and they are fighting against this threat to their interests and the interests of all peace-loving peoples in the world. The "European Defense Community" is said to be a kind of "organic unity" that merges the armed forces of certain Western European countries, and this fact, according to Mr. Dulles, will ensure its non-aggressive nature.

But the facts are just the opposite. The facts show that the West German militarists are now trying in every possible way to restore their war industry and military strength. As the Bonn War Minister Blank openly declared, the first step is to establish twelve divisions of the West German armed forces to participate in the "European Defense Community," and then increase this number to sixty divisions, and within two or three years, increase the total number of the West German army to eight hundred thousand—from here one can see the road to the establishment of the future "German supremacy" armed forces, which will undoubtedly use fire and sword to attack its neighbors, attack other parts of Europe, and thus try to make itself known again.

This is the source of the threat to European security. The lightning of the approaching military storm is coming from here! Only political blind men and political gamblers who want to bring about another world war cannot see this. As European history has shown, the restoration of German military power will undoubtedly threaten the security of Europe and the world. Many people who can calmly analyze the facts have realized this, even among American big businessmen. For example, the famous American banker James Warburg, in his book "Germany—The Key to Peace" (1953), when talking about the plan to revive German militarism, said that the United States has established or helped to establish a new, divided German state with forty-eight million discontented inhabitants, a state that threatens the future of the German people, threatens European peace, and finally threatens American security. This new Germany was completely established by the West under the guidance of the United States. This is not the "new" and peaceful democratic Germany that the United States advocated a few years ago. Warburg pointed out that this is still the old Germany...the Germany that gave birth to Hitler, despite various political changes, the industrial giants and political bureaucrats who have managed to preserve themselves.

The famous British historian and advisor to Downing Street, Professor Hedley Bull, as early as 1925, in his diplomatic history essay, wrote that if Germany completely restored its military power, the German army's spearhead, as in the past, would always be directed at France and Belgium. But the happiness of not only France and Belgium, but also other European countries, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Britain, and the Soviet Union, is threatened by German militarism.

Some people talk about guarantees against the threat of war, which revived German militarism will provide to the peoples of European countries. Some people talk about special agreements, such as the Locarno Treaty. But those who hastily dragged Germany into the League of Nations also said that the Locarno Treaty was the "beginning of a new era for Europe and the world." In fact, as Stalin said, the Locarno Treaty was a plan to deploy forces to prepare for another war, not a plan to maintain peace. Stalin said that the Locarno Treaty was filled with the smell of another war. Even Clemenceau said that the Locarno Treaty was a "piece of paper that Germany would tear up when necessary." Ten years later, when Hitler's Germany unilaterally tore up the Locarno Treaty and took this decisive step to prepare for another war, the situation was exactly like this. This war finally broke out in 1939-1941. Today, some people say that Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 was a "defensive war," saying that this was to some extent due to Germany's consideration of the future population situation with its enemies, is this not an attempt to defend the German fascists who launched a war against democratic countries, mainly against the Soviet Union? Is it not that many so-called American scientists, such as Speckmann, Pusan, Strauss, and Hoop, whose pseudo-scientific garbage is flooding the market, are quite complacently defending the war gamble? These gentlemen even say that during the Second World War, "population theory was a tool of war," "war was the main arbiter of the fate of nations," and the decision of this arbiter was based on the factor of force. With the encouragement of the powerful militaristic and aggressive elements in the United States, the aforementioned widely circulated and purchased works have become bestsellers in the United States.

Keeping treaties is not fashionable among imperialist monopolists. In this regard, West Germany, which has restored the old (mainly Hitler's) diplomatic tradition, is no exception. West Germany is now under the control of the United States and the West German monopolies, especially the Rhine-Ruhr monopolies, which are the true executors of the imperialist policy of the German Kaiser—Hitler and Adenauer. Under the guise of "defense," the militarization of West Germany is being carried out with full force. American monopolists, who have long had open and covert cooperation with West German monopolists in war preparations, are making special efforts to rebuild West German military power, which is an important factor in the U.S. plan to seize world hegemony.

Such a situation emphasizes the military aggressive nature of the "European Defense Community," which is to be based on the West German armed forces, while the West German ruling class is intent on revenge. The Bundestag of Bonn passed a resolution to this effect: "Instruct the government to draw the attention of the signatories of the European Army Treaty: the current borders of Germany, whether in the east or west, are not at all suitable for the Federal Republic." Is such a resolution not enough to prove the above-mentioned things?

It is no wonder that in the countries of the world, especially in European countries, including France, broad popular movements, drawing lessons from the two previous world wars, strongly oppose the ratification of this treaty, which is very dangerous to the French people, to all the neighbors of West Germany, and to all peace-loving peoples. The failure of this treaty in France is a great victory for the forces of peace. The failure of this treaty is also a heavy blow to the "power" policy. It is a serious warning to the war instigators, propagandists, and organizers. The supporters of the "European Defense Community" naturally lament the failure of this treaty as a great misfortune. At the same time, they are constantly looking for substitutes that can guarantee the success of their plans (plans similar to the "European Defense Community" plan). How different are the interests of the countries of the peace camp from the interests of the leaders of the opposing camp! The rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty by the French National Assembly convincingly shows how much the policy of establishing mutually opposed national lines in Europe is contrary to the interests of peace-loving peoples. The above decision of the French Parliament, of course, satisfies all those who support the true security of the peoples of Europe with actions rather than empty talk and support the consolidation of universal peace.

The peoples of the world who love peace consider this action to be a very fortunate thing for the fate of the world. Some others probably consider this to be unfortunate for the fate of the world. The two different attitudes themselves already explain the problem.

The problem of European security is inseparable from the German problem. On both of these issues, there are two fundamentally different political lines: one political line is to advocate the establishment of a united, peaceful, and democratic Germany, and to establish a provisional all-German government to implement this plan, and to unify Germany on the basis of truly free and democratic all-German elections to convene an all-German constituent assembly. The other line is the line embodied in the plans of the three Western countries, one of whose characteristics is to try to bind the future all-German government to the performance of (in the words of the plan) the international obligations of the Bonn government for the next fifty years. Such a situation, of course, excludes any possibility of Germany acting as a truly "free and autonomous" country in these fifty years. On the other hand, this plan does not provide for measures to prevent or prevent the development of militaristic and revanchist ambitions in the future. On the other hand, it should be remembered that the principles on which the all-European treaty proposed by the Soviet Union is based are collective defense by all the countries participating in the all-European treaty against armed aggression launched by one or more contracting parties against Europe. The countries participating in this treaty undertake not to participate in or conclude any alliances, alliances, or agreements that violate the purpose of guaranteeing collective security in Europe. Such a European system can create real conditions for European security. This will be a big step forward in this important matter, and it will also create more favorable conditions for solving the German problem by establishing a united, peaceful, independent, and democratic Germany. Reality itself proves that it is impossible to solve the German problem without solving the problem of European security.

It should also be emphasized that the solution of the German problem will undoubtedly also promote the solution of the Austrian problem. Dulles also mentioned the Austrian problem in his speech at the Assembly, but he vainly tried to present the matter as if the Soviet Union had proposed new conditions when the Austrian Treaty was about to be signed. This is contrary to the facts. As early as 1949, the four powers had reached a basic consensus on the Austrian Treaty, except for a few points. However, it was the Western countries that suddenly proposed new suggestions in the form of a so-called simplified treaty, and the content of these suggestions was so unacceptable that after about two years, the United States, Britain, and France themselves withdrew this simplified treaty. However, at the same time, some situations that cannot be ignored occurred, which make it necessary for the Austrian Treaty to definitely stipulate that new plans for the reunification of Germany and Austria and the formation of a new military aggressive alliance by Germany and Austria should not be imposed on Austria, and that the democratic and peaceful development of Austria should be guaranteed. However, the United States has consistently opposed this. The situation regarding the Austrian Treaty is like this.

The solution of the Korean problem is of great importance.

Everyone knows that no positive solutions to the Korean problem were reached in Geneva. However, for the sake of the unification of the whole of Korea and the interests of world peace, the Korean problem must be solved urgently. Everyone knows that due to the fact that the Lee Syngman clique is trying to gradually sabotage the Korean armistice and launch a new war against the Korean people, the solution of the Korean problem has become even more urgent.

The demand to solve the Korean problem has, in fact, come knocking at the door. Therefore, the Assembly must make every effort to solve this problem. At the Geneva Conference, the delegations of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea all made constructive proposals for the peaceful solution of this problem. During the discussion of the Korean problem in Geneva, the views of the Soviet delegation and the British delegation were relatively close, and both delegations believed that it is very important to determine the basic principles for reaching an agreement on the Korean problem. This will be a big step forward in the preparation for the restoration of the unity of the Korean state. However, the representatives of some other delegations did not support this attitude, and the representative of Belgium even said that the proposal of the Soviet delegation would lead to "terrible consequences" for the United Nations. However, despite the fact that the Geneva Conference made no progress in discussing the Korean problem, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea still made concrete proposals for the solution of this problem, which were supplemented by the draft declaration of the Soviet delegation. This draft declaration said: "The countries participating in the Geneva Conference have already agreed: during the period of waiting for the final solution of the Korean problem on the basis of the establishment of a unified, independent, democratic state, no actions that threaten the maintenance of Korean peace should be taken. The participants express their belief that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea will act in the interests of peace in accordance with this declaration." The Korean problem must be solved without delay. Its solution is undoubtedly seriously hindered by the so-called "mutual defense treaty" signed by the United States and South Korea—a treaty determined by the plan to use South Korea as a bridgehead for waging war in the Far East.

Title: The United States' Military Alliance and the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy

Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 1

We believe that the relevant countries should continue their efforts to reach an agreement to peacefully resolve the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic nation.

However, the collapse of the "European Defense Community" and the failure of reactionary forces to obstruct the end of the Indochina War have not stopped their further efforts to obstruct the easing of international tensions, as such tensions are beneficial for preparing for a new world war. The Manila Conference is undoubtedly such an attempt. In Manila, several countries led by the United States decided to establish a new bloc with the same objectives as the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization." American propaganda has vigorously portrayed the Manila Conference as a victory for collective defense in Southeast Asia. However, most Asian countries, such as India and Indonesia, with a combined population of nearly 450 million, have refused to participate in the Manila Conference and the Manila Treaty, which itself convincingly exposes the hypocrisy of the claim that the Manila Conference and the treaty signed by its participating countries aim to "defend" Southeast Asian countries and are in the interests of their peoples. This aggressive plan is opposed by the People's Republic of China and its 600 million people, which further proves this point. The so-called "defense" of Southeast Asia is essentially a plan to use the help of certain Asian countries to launch armed intervention in Asia "on a collective basis" (as some of the initiators of this plan have said). This plan is similar to the Korean War plan: using the participation of certain small Asian countries as a smokescreen to cover the special interests of colonialists in controlling this region, to organize foreign intervention. This plan is a plan to suppress the national liberation movements in Southeast Asian countries, aiming to make Asians fight Asians.

To cover up these objectives, the initiators of these plans have claimed that it is necessary to guarantee the "freedom" and independence of the peoples of Asian countries, but they do not hide the fact that they have no intention of giving this "independence." The important thing is to make this declaration to better recruit soldiers for puppet armies and thus better cover up their own participation in this military adventure, cover up their interest in this war. To achieve this, they plan to use the name and flag of the United Nations again to give this military adventure "moral support," while organizing this military adventure to (as the spokesman of the U.S. State Department said) safeguard "vital interests under threat" — mainly American interests. What are these interests? According to the official records of the U.S. Senate Committee, Mr. Dulles, when talking about American interests in Indochina, said: strategically, they are closely linked to the so-called island chain along the coast. This coastal island chain has two continental bases: the Korean Peninsula to the north and the Indochina that Mr. Dulles hopes for to the south. In addition, there are some islands between them: Japan, Ryukyu (including Okinawa), Taiwan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. The United States has reached understandings in various ways to ensure the security of each of these regions, and these understandings, although not always in treaty form, are still very real and very effective. After some time, Mr. Dulles spoke again on the same issue. He said that Indochina is a granary, a region rich in tin, oil, rubber, iron sand, and other raw materials, and that the loss of the Chinese mainland to the United States is a great misfortune, and if in addition to this, the loss of the hundreds of millions of people in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, and the vast economic resources and strategic positions, this misfortune would be even greater.

All these admissions leave no doubt that the establishment of the Manila Group is to make it easier for American monopolists to continue exploiting the natural resources and peoples of Asian countries. The American monopolists, who claim to "lead the world," are particularly interested in exploiting the natural resources and peoples of Asian countries, but have been obstructed by the victories of the national liberation movements in the East and Asia.

The intensity of American interest in this — as it is in all parts of the world — is well known. Equally well known is the consistent means used by the United States since the McKinley administration to defend these interests.

From these admissions, it is clear that the objectives, purposes, and plans of the initiators of such treaties as the Manila Treaty have nothing in common with the interests of peace.

This treaty exposes the warmongering plans of its planners and participants, and it cannot be believed that talk of peace intentions or such a forced argument: that the treaty pursues the goal of "defense" and "security" of the peoples of the regions that American monopolists particularly covet.

However, about half a century ago, the famous American legal authority Clark, in a memorandum, correctly stated that no country like the U.S. government has repeatedly used armed forces to temporarily occupy parts of other countries' territories. From Clark's memorandum, we can also know that such intervention took the form of actual interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

The respected legal advisor to the State Department in that memorandum said that in such cases, the usual pretexts used are to talk about humanity, human nature, to protect the citizens of a certain country, etc. Such talk is still widely used today.

In Manila, there was also an attempt to use talk of so-called "defense and security" to cover up this new act of aggression. Such talk cannot deceive anyone.

While organizing the Manila Group, staff officers and other experts engaged in drafting plans for another world war are doing their practical work. They are trying to establish a system of military measures based on the so-called "massive retaliation" plan. The so-called "massive retaliation" plan is essentially nothing but a plan to prepare for a preventive war. The talk of retaliation is obviously fabricated.

The purpose of this talk is to deceive public opinion, making people believe that the hostile actions currently being prepared are only retaliatory actions against attacks, although the myth of such attacks threatening the United States has long been exposed. The main purpose of the so-called "massive retaliation" plan is obviously to launch a preventive war — to strike first. When the preparations for the so-called "massive retaliation" are ready, the organizers of this preparation proceed from the assumption that launching a war against the imaginary enemy is beneficial to American generals.

This plan is a replica of the mad Hitler's lightning war plan or the plan of Japanese militarists to attack the U.S. Pearl Harbor. In a speech at the beginning of this year, Dulles, when promoting the "massive retaliation" plan, said that the United States should strike in any part of the world — in the Arctic and tropical regions, in Asia, the Middle East and Europe, on the sea, land, and air, with old and new weapons.

Can such an open threat of aggression not expose the true aggressive purpose of the talk of "retaliatory strikes" that Dulles likes to use? In fact, in such a case, this must necessarily be the first strike, not a retaliatory strike. To say that this will be a "retaliatory strike," the purpose is to cover up the war that is being prepared. Gordon Dean, who has a close relationship with Mr. Dulles, made a clearer statement about the purpose of the so-called "retaliation" policy. Mr. Dean, in the "Bulletin of Atomic Scientists," directly advocated a preventive atomic war against the Soviet Union.

The chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Strauss, made a speech in the same vein in the Senate Appropriations Committee, saying that according to the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the advantages of all thermonuclear weapons should be used to ensure American superiority.

Based on the policy of large-scale use of atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs, these typical offensive weapons, measures are being taken to use atomic weapons and rockets with "honest Jones," "Caprol," "Regulus," etc., in the army as much as possible. The deluded militarists are advocating the power of atomic cannons to incite war hysteria. They say that such cannons will be able to blow open "wide paths" in the enemy's front line, and the attacking troops will rush through these "gaps" to victory....

Everything is calculated clearly. For such "hurrah" warmongers' nonsense, our people have a saying: "It looks easy on paper, but forgets the valley. And this is exactly what should not be forgotten."

The storage of atomic weapons occupies a primary position in American policy, which can be seen from the semi-annual report of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.

From this report, we know, for example, that the total amount of the national atomic weapons stockpile is increasing rapidly, reflecting a trend towards the development of more types and varieties of such weapons. The development of this type of weapon has expanded the military use of existing fissile materials. While developing atomic weapons, research on thermonuclear weapons has also been developed since 1950. According to this report, a national political decision has been made to facilitate various possible means to ensure that the United States maintains its superiority. According to this decision, the President has ordered the Commission to continue the production of atomic weapons in 1954.

Everyone knows that the budget can best reflect a country's life. Now I will not go into this issue in detail, I just want to mention that the military policy is prominently reflected in the budgets of Western countries. The U.S. budget is particularly so. If we compare the U.S. military expenditures in this fiscal year with the budget expenditures on social insurance, public health, education, and housing construction, we can see: the expenditures in these areas account for only 4.2% of the total expenditures, while 66% of the total expenditures are allocated for direct military purposes. This comparison itself can explain the problem.

The figures mentioned above, which characterize the features of the U.S. budget this year, can also specifically illustrate what the "policy of strength" actually represents, and how heavy the burden is for taxpayers who have to endure the cuts in education, health care, and social insurance.

On the other hand, the largest monopolies that control all orders for war materials have made unbelievable profits in the production of atomic weapons. For them, the production of atomic energy for peaceful purposes is of little economic interest, and incidentally, for the main figures in American politics. According to qualified persons, a U.S. atomic power plant will not be able to generate electricity for another three or four years, while the Soviet Union has already built an atomic power plant, which is not accidental. The beginning of electricity generation by the Soviet power plant has brought about a real industrial-technological revolution. This fact has strengthened the confidence in the great future of atomic energy serving the peaceful needs of mankind, but at the same time, it has caused serious concern in the camp of militarists, as everyone knows, these people are not interested in the production of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Countless facts show that these people pay little attention to this progress, all their attention and energy are concentrated on the development of atomic weapons production as much as possible. On the one hand, they continue to build their plans on the so-called atomic armaments superiority, on the other hand, they continue to maintain and further exacerbate international tensions. These people like war prosperity and the "policy of strength." This policy also suits the taste of powerful military groups represented by Admiral Radford and General Gruenther, who are now engaged in drafting the so-called long-term strategy, which is based on a preventive war using atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs.

In Western countries, especially in the United States, the feature of the past year has been the acceleration of the arms race. In the United States, the stockpiling of atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs, in particular, has reflected this, which is reflected in the increase in expenditures by the Atomic Energy Commission, which is the largest expenditure for this purpose in the past few years. Therefore, the tense competition to use atomic energy as a tool of death, as Mr. Dulles said, rather than as a source of prosperity, continues.

As early as last year, the Soviet government, in its proposal of December 8, emphasized the extremely important significance of such a fact as the actual possibility of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and agreed to negotiate on this issue. On January 30-February 2, 1954, the Soviet government handed over to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France a draft declaration on the unconditional non-use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, or any other weapons of mass destruction. The preamble of this declaration talks about the determination to save mankind from the threat of destructive wars using atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, or other weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, it emphasizes the need to strive by all means to ensure that the scientific discoveries in the field of atomic energy are used only for peaceful purposes, to promote the well-being of the peoples of all countries and to improve their living conditions.

The Soviet government proceeds from the assumption that not only part, but all atomic materials should be completely used for peaceful purposes, and that achievements in this field should serve the purposes of economic and cultural progress, not for war and the mass destruction of peoples. The Soviet government proceeds from the assumption that this would open unprecedented opportunities for the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation, for medical applications, for improving technology, and for promoting scientific progress. The Soviet government proceeds from the fact that the U.S. proposal of December 8 cannot help to eliminate the threat of atomic war, and that this threat, especially due to the appearance of new types of atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs with increasingly destructive power, is increasingly causing concern in many countries. As for the new items on the agenda — international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy — this issue should be discussed again when more specific proposals and relevant materials are received in the future.

The documents exchanged by the Soviet Union and the United States on this issue have already been published. Due to the exchange of these documents, it is possible to conduct a detailed study of the attitude towards the steps to be taken by the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy. In this regard, I am surprised at the way Mr. Dulles acted in his speech at the General Assembly and the way Mr. Lodge acted in the Committee on Arrangements, who said that the Soviet government had rejected the proposal to hold negotiations to discuss measures for the peaceful use of atomic energy.

To illustrate the complete groundlessness of this claim, it is enough to cite the Soviet government's memorandum of April 27 to the United States, which states: "The Soviet government has always sincerely wanted to strengthen international peace, and in the current situation, especially to promote the elimination of the threat of atomic war, therefore, the Soviet government is ready to participate in the corresponding negotiations at any time."

In the memorandum of September 22 (the contents of which, of course, were known to Mr. Dulles and Mr. Lodge before their speeches in the United Nations), the Soviet government announced that it is "ready to continue such negotiations to study the proposals of the Soviet government and the U.S. government."

Any attempt to portray the attitude of the Soviet Union on this issue as the attitude of the Soviet Union in insisting on some prior conditions before participating in measures aimed at the peaceful use of atomic energy is groundless. It should also be noted that the proposal of December 8 did not mention the non-use of atomic weapons and ignored the constant demands of the peoples of all countries for the prohibition of atomic weapons and their removal from the armaments of all countries.

Such an attitude on this issue is not in line with the requirements of maintaining peace and ensuring the security of the peoples of all countries. The Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to reach an international agreement that can prevent the use of atomic energy for military purposes and ensure that it is used only for peaceful purposes. The possibility of reaching an agreement on international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy is far from exhausted. This is our deep conviction. As for our proposal for all countries to declare the renunciation of the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen bombs, there is no doubt that the need for such an agreement is not only far from being eliminated, but is becoming increasingly urgent. We cannot allow measures aimed at the peaceful use of atomic energy to become a tool for continuing the atomic arms race. However, such a danger still exists. One of the drafters of the famous Acheson-Baruch-Lilienthal plan for atomic energy control, Bernard Baruch, pointed out this point in his important confession in a pamphlet on contemporary philosophy. Mr. Baruch, in his pamphlet, wrote that regardless of the contributions to this international stockpile, different countries would still use most of the fissile materials to develop atomic weapons and other nuclear weapons. The danger of atomic attacks would not be reduced, and the atomic arms race would not be relaxed.

The past year has shown that since the proposal for an atomic stockpile was made, the United States has not only not relaxed the arms race, the stockpiling of nuclear weapons, and other military aggression measures, but has tightened these measures, especially in the field of nuclear weapons.

Many facts of this year indicate that the U.S. foreign policy is still relying on the policy of strength. Therefore, the policy that determines various military measures of the U.S. government is centered on the atomic bomb, which is officially declared to be the basis for effectively implementing U.S. policy. This policy creates a war psychology at home, incites hostility and hatred towards the peoples of other countries, encourages propaganda for a new world war, and thus inevitably leads to the expansion of armaments, the establishment of more and more bases on foreign soil, and the gathering of new military blocs under the cover of the lie of defending against the alleged threat from communist countries.

The success of the Geneva Conference has broken the sly calculations of the supporters of the "policy of strength," the U.S. policy has suffered a setback in the approval of the so-called "European Defense Community," and the conspiracy to obstruct the ceasefire in Indochina has also failed. All this has prompted certain countries — including the United States and its Western European allies — to adopt new conspiracies to obstruct the easing of international tensions and the normalization of international relations.

There is no doubt that these conspiracies are also doomed to fail, because the will of the people for peace is becoming stronger and stronger, while the forces of war are becoming weaker and weaker.

The "policy of strength" is also an important tool used by American monopolists to keep military prosperity at the highest possible level, they try to use it to prevent the development of the cyclical crisis that has already arrived in the United States, and to further enrich themselves through military orders.

The crisis trend in the United States also has a serious adverse effect on the economic situation of other Western European countries, as well as agricultural and colonial countries. The economic policy of the United States and its high tariffs and laws giving priority to the purchase of American goods, etc., hinder the export of Western European countries to the United States, causing a "dollar shortage" in Western European countries, and due to the U.S. trade restrictions and embargoes against the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as other similar measures that seriously harm the interests of Western European countries, this "dollar shortage" is becoming more and more serious. If Western European countries get rid of the restrictions imposed on them in trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, they can easily eliminate this "dollar shortage." According to experts' calculations, restoring the import of wheat, corn, barley, tobacco, timber, crude oil, petroleum products, and other commodities from Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to the level before the Batelle Law and other similar restrictive measures came into effect, would save Western European countries about $600 million in these commodities alone.

It is clear that the elimination of artificial barriers to trade and the normalization of economic relations is urgently needed. This is in the fundamental and immediate interests of all countries. This is in the interests of peace and international security. This is also in the interests of backward countries, which particularly need to abolish embargoes and other similar trade restrictions. This is in the interests of peace and international security. Trade is an important factor that can bring people closer, eliminate mutual distrust, and ensure the possibility of true peaceful coexistence. It is quite natural that a widespread movement for the normalization of international economic relations, especially trade, has been launched around the world. It is worth noting that a recent report by the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration points out that an increasing number of people in Western Europe believe that trade between the East and the West has a great future, and for Western European countries, such trade can become a true "horn of plenty," enabling them to eliminate unemployment, poverty, and foreign exchange difficulties, and to lay the foundation for lasting and stable peace.

The experience of the past year has shown that the overwhelming majority of businessmen in the world strive to expand trade and economic relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, and they see and recognize the broad prospects that such relations open up for their economic, cultural, and political well-being.

The British magazine "The Economist" recently published a speech by the deputy chairman of the British National Chamber of Commerce, who said that in the near future, the greatest hope for expanding overseas markets lies in increasing East-West trade.

So, gentlemen, what is the decisive key to the problem? What is obstructing it? It is the Batelle Law and various restrictions that are obstructing it. To meet the hopes of the world, these obstacles must be removed.

The path taken by the Soviet Union is to expand and develop relations with all countries, as long as they are also willing to do so. The foreign trade relations of the Soviet Union are expanding every year. The Soviet Union's foreign trade volume has now increased to twice that of 1948. Life itself is breaking the shackles that some people use to bind the economic relations between the Soviet Union and Western European countries. The relations between the Soviet Union and Western European countries are constantly developing, activating the international political atmosphere with an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect for each other's interests and benefits.

The Soviet Union's foreign trade policy, aimed at strengthening and freely and widely developing international economic relations, is an inseparable part of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, which expresses the firm determination of the Soviet people to live in peace and friendship with the peoples of all countries and to strengthen peace and international security.

The great builder of the Soviet state, Lenin, pointed out more than thirty years ago when talking about the Genoa Conference that cooperation between the Soviet Republic and capitalist countries is possible and even necessary. He said: "It is known that the capitalist powers in recent years have the most urgent, most necessary, most practical, and most clearly exposed interest in developing, adjusting, and expanding trade relations with Russia. Since there is such an interest, then there will be debates, disputes, and disagreements on various proposals — even possibly leading to a break — but in the end, this basic economic necessity will open up a way for itself.... It can be said with considerable confidence that normal commercial relations between the Soviet Republic and all other capitalist countries will certainly advance."

The Soviet Union resolutely and consistently defends peace and firmly advocates the adoption of important and fundamental measures to prevent the threat of another world war and thus prevent incalculable new disasters and the sacrifice of hundreds of millions of people.

At every session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union has been working to achieve a satisfactory solution to this important issue. The Soviet Union is convinced that the United Nations General Assembly should and can solve this problem and realize the wishes of the peoples of the countries that demand peace and security.

Based on the above, the Soviet delegation proposes the following resolution draft for consideration by the ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly:

"On the Conclusion of an International Convention (Treaty) for the Reduction of Armaments, the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction

First Part

The Assembly instructs the United Nations Disarmament Commission to draft a draft international convention (treaty) to be submitted to the Security Council for approval, which convention aims to strengthen peace and international security and is based on the proposal of France and Britain on June 11, 1954, to prohibit atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, to eliminate these weapons from the armaments of states, to significantly reduce armaments, and to establish an international supervision system to supervise the implementation of these decisions.

In accordance with this, the convention (treaty) should include the following basic provisions:

1. Simultaneously implement the following measures:

   a. States should reduce their armaments, armed forces, and national military budget allocations by 50% of the agreed amount within six months (or one year). The reduction of armaments and armed forces should be based on the level of armaments and armed forces as of December 31, 1953, and the reduction of allocations should be based on the level of military needs expenditures for the year ending December 31, 1953.

   b. To supervise the fulfillment of the obligations of states to reduce armaments and armed forces as stipulated in item a, a temporary international supervision committee should be established under the Security Council, which has the right to require states to provide necessary information about the measures taken to reduce armaments and armed forces. The committee should take necessary measures to supervise the fulfillment of the obligations of states to reduce armaments and armed forces and to reduce military budget allocations. States should provide information about the implementation of the measures stipulated in the convention at specified times.

2. To make the measures stipulated in the first section complete, the following measures should be implemented simultaneously:

   a. States should further reduce their armaments, armed forces, and national military budget allocations by 50% of the agreed amount within six months (or one year). The reduction of armaments and armed forces should be based on the level of armaments and armed forces as of December 31, 1953, and the reduction of allocations should be based on the level of military needs expenditures for the year ending December 31, 1953.

   b. Completely prohibit atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, stop the production of these types of weapons, and completely eliminate these weapons from the armaments of states; all existing atomic materials should only be used for peaceful purposes.

   All these measures should be implemented no later than the measures for the reduction of armaments and armed forces stipulated in the second section a. As soon as the reduction of armaments, armed forces, and military budget allocations by 50% of the agreed amount begins, the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons should be stopped immediately.

   c. States should establish a permanent international institution to supervise the implementation of the convention (treaty) on the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, the cessation of the production of these weapons, the elimination of these weapons from the armaments of states, and the reduction of armaments, armed forces, and military budget allocations. In addition, such an international institution should be authorized to supervise the implementation of the convention on the necessary scale to ensure that all states implement it, including permanent supervision.

Second Part

Regarding the proposals contained in the memorandum submitted by France and Britain on June 11, 1954, on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons except for defense against aggression, the United Nations General Assembly instructs the United Nations Disarmament Commission to study and clarify this issue and to make proposals."

Chairman, gentlemen,

The Soviet delegation, in proposing these proposals, is deeply convinced that these proposals will receive the most careful study and that these proposals will help the United Nations in its struggle against the expansion of armaments, against the threat of another war, to maintain peace and international security, to fulfill its duties.

### 缔结关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器问题的国际公约

    缔结关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器问题的国际公约（条约）
    ——维辛斯基九月三十日在联大全体会议上的演说主席先生，各位先生：
    在大会开始工作的时候，照例要进行一般性辩论，以便各个代表团能就他们认为最重要和值得大会予以最大注意的问题提出自己的看法。某些代表团已经利用了这种机会，其中不乏有人试图分析一下目前的国际形势，估计一下联合国组织在这些事件中的作用，并企图说明一下联合国和全世界所面临的重大事件今后发展的历史——姑且这样说——前途。可是，许多代表在指出第九届会议的议程包括有以前历届会议上讨论过的某些问题，并且以最好的植物学方法把这些问题当作“多年生植物”一样来加以分类的时候，他们却不敢对这种现象加以解释，而且即使有些人加以解释，在我们看来，他们的努力也不能算是成功的。他们那样的对于世界事件的分析，人们自然不能认为是能令人愉快的。因为历史进程被描写为一些事实的胡乱堆砌，而造成这些事实的原因则是有些人的捣乱成性，他们力图——对这里的某些代表来说——搅乱世界秩序，因此以他们胡来的方法，强迫讲理的、善良的其他国家代表沉溺于扩张军备、存储原子弹和氢弹、拼凑新的集团、在别的国家人民的领土上建筑基地、和拟订新的世界大战计划等等这类的工作。自然，对世界事态发展的这种说法是和社会历史发展的真正进程毫不符合的。实际上，怀抱这种想法的人是只见树木，不见森林。他们看不见在历史发展进程中起作用的法则。而要是从这样一种原则来观察事物，不仅能够正确地估计世界事件——如像现在遍及亚洲各国的民族解放运动——的意义，而且还能够确定联合国的立场和策略，而这种立场和策略又是应该预先确定联合国对这些事件的行动和措施的计划的。
    也不能忽视这样一件事实：有人企图大肆赞扬联合国过去的工作，虽然这种企图是和普世皆知的事实相违背的。这些事实表明，作为一个应当维持国际和平和安全的国际组织来说，联合国在过去多次起了令人遗憾的作用。联合国组织违反了联合国宪章所要求于它的根据正义和国际法的原则行事的职责，从而使它的国际威望受到了损害。忠于联合国的原则和联合国宪章是联合国的工作能取得成功的根本条件。
    杜勒斯先生在九月二十三日的演说中说，美国人民衷心地相信联合国宪章中所规定的宗旨和原则。我们并不怀疑美国人民是衷心地相信联合国的宗旨和原则的。但是，美国人民和这些问题没有多大关系，而那些和联合国工作有关系的美国人却常常无视这个组织的原则，违反这些原则并远远地离开联合国的宗旨。难道关于邀请中华人民共和国在联合国中享有其合法席位这件事，还不足证明这一点吗？这件事年复一年地重复发生着，到今天已经有好几届会议了。美国在这个问题上所采取的立场，是不合法的和违反联合国宪章的原则和国际法的。那些支持美国立场的代表团顽固地反对恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法席位，这就证实了这些代表团是不愿意按照忠于联合国的原则的需要办事的。我们将继续不断地指出这种状况的不正常的性质。要求停止阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国中享有其合法席位，乃是合法的。我们深信，这一合法要求应予满足。我们深信，中国政府的代表参加我们的工作，将对有些国家的努力作出重大的贡献，这些国家在联合国中抱定的目标就是要维护和平和用国际合作的原则来解决经济、社会、文化和人道性质的国际问题。
    在这些任务当中，有着至为重要的任务，完成这些任务就会有助于避免新的世界大战的危险，并巩固世界和平。为了达到这一目的，必须采取多种措施，其中包括一些极为重要的措施，像禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器，并从各国军备中取消这些武器，大量裁减军备并监督这些以及若干其他决定的实施。大会在这些重要的问题上通过大家同意的决定，无疑会对进一步缓和国际紧张局势和改善各国之间的关系，发生非常有益的影响。
    苏联深信，只要各国主权平等和不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，只要各国互相尊重彼此的权利和利益并履行自己的国际义务，那么，按照和平和国际安全的利益在悬而未决的问题上达成协议，是完全有可能的。如果这样，解决悬而未决的国际问题的前景，就会是十分现实的了。我们对此确信不疑。我们之所以相信这种前景是现实的，主要是由于我们相信世界各国人民都关怀和平和国际合作，都愿意发展和平的国际关系。我们的这种信心是建筑在列宁关于政治结构不同的各国是有可能和平共处的学说上的。
    苏联将近四十年来努力同许多国家维持善邻关系，尽管同它们的政治制度不同；这一事实就证明了这种信心。经常有人试图缩小和平共处原则的重要性。例如，杜勒斯先生一九五四年五月十五日在威廉斯堡发表的一篇演说中毫无根据地说：“共处并不是苏联共产党的信条或实践的一部分，除非是在这样的意义上：允许非共产党人的肉体存在。”智利代表则认为共处问题只不过是——如他所说——一个侵略者的宣传机器所提出的一个口号罢了。这些说法都是绝对没有任何根据的。要证实这点，人们可以引述许许多多的事实，但是只要重新提一提下面这一事实就足够了：早在一九二二年，列宁在向“观察家报”和“曼彻斯特卫报”的一位记者发表谈话中，谈到俄罗斯共和国和资本主义国家——特别是英国——在经济利益的基础上恢复邦交的可能性时说：“……我们认为，同两国（他指的是英国和法国）建立完全友好的关系是相当可能的，而且是我们的目标……我们认为，英国和法国的利益，如果正确地被理解的话，也是朝着同一方向行动的。”
    当时的问题是：是否可以想像一个社会主义共和国能在资本主义包围的情况下存在？
    对这个问题，苏维埃国家的伟大缔造者列宁回答说：“初看起来，似乎在政治和军事两方面都是不可想像的。而在政治和军事两方面却都是可能的，这一点已经得到证明，这是事实。但是在商业方面如何呢？关于经济交流呢？在落后的、千疮百孔的、农业的俄国和一批先进的、在工业上是富有的资本主义国家之间建立关系、援助、交换劳务又如何呢——是否可能呢？他们不是曾经扬言要以铁丝网来包围我们，因此不会有任何经济关系存在吗？”
    他们谈论过，咆哮过，甚至设法以相当的行动来加强它们的言论。但是，即使在那时，生活令人信服地证明：企图无视苏维埃共和国和西方世界其他国家之间政治与经济关系的重要性的一切努力已归于失败。西方国家不得不承认，各国尽管政治制度不同，仍有共处的可能性。
    至于苏联，它坚守这一立场，如像它过去一直坚守的那样。苏联和资本主义世界之间关系的以后的所有发展，都证实了共处原则的重要性、现实性和必要性。目前，只有西方国家中彻头彻尾的反动派才继续拒绝承认这一重要的原则，这个原则具有伟大的实践意义，它在发展正常的国际关系中，过去一直起着重要的作用，今后将继续起重要的作
  用。
    苏联政府一方面集中全力迅速发展苏联国内的和平经济建设，同时还一直采取一切必要措施来保证同其他国家的正常政治关系的发展，并保证国际关系的正常化。
    苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃的一次会议上说：“我们始终实行和平和巩固国际合作的政策。”
    这就是苏联外交政策的基础和宗旨。
    在内政政策方面，苏联一直在为不断发展我们的国民经济、提高苏联人民以及整个苏维埃社会的物质和文化水平而努力。预算中大部分款项用在发展工业生产、农业、贸易和运输方面。亿万卢布的巨额款项用于社会和文化措施：普及教育、训练工人、发展科学和艺术、社会保险、养老金、家庭津贴和产妇补贴等等。
    今年苏联预算中的文化用途和公用事业的开支比防御拨款多百分之四十，防御拨款只占预算百分之十七点八，或者说比去年少百分之二点六。这样
  一种政策排除了军事用途拨款在苏联预算中占压倒地位的可能性，更不要谈同扩充军备、在外国领土上建立军事基地、或建立军事集团有关的措施了。
    苏联在原则上和实践上都反对实行这些措施的政策。这也是苏联坚持不渝地努力谋求禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器、禁止战争宣传和大量裁减军备和武装部队的原因。苏联深信，只有以上述原则为基础的政策才能加强国际信任和国际合作，才能结束世界上的国家分裂为敌对阵营的状态。关于这一点，我们不能不提一提莫洛托夫在他的关于柏林会议结果的声明中说过的话：
      “我们希望，在保卫和平的问题上，无论在欧洲和全世界都不分为两个阵营。我们呼吁所有欧洲国家拒绝建立互相对立的军事集团，因为建立这样的集团就不能不导致战争。我们建议，由凡是愿意保障它们的安全和巩固欧洲和平的欧洲国家组成一个单一的阵营。”这对于世界各国都是适用的。
    从如果要保持和平就必须形成一个单一的阵营这样的前提出发，苏联政府一直反对、并且现在仍然反对建立一些国家组成的单独的、狭隘的集团，例如像“欧洲防务集团”，它把它自己置于和其他国家敌对的地位，它只不过是有着明显的侵略目的的军事集团而已。这种情况是同苏联的外交政策所根据的国际法和国际往来的基本原则背道而驰的。
    哪里有这些原则应用，哪里就有有助于加强国际信任和相互尊重、有助于巩固世界和平和国际安全的各国人民间的和平的友谊合作。关于这一点，我们不能不提一下印度、中华人民共和国和缅甸在六月间的德里和仰光会谈后定为它们间的关系的基础的五项原则。这些原则是：互相尊重领土主权；互不侵犯；互不干涉内政；平等互利；和平共处。
    我们热烈地欢迎这些原则。
    大会本届会议是在朝鲜战争结束和印度支那和平恢复后国际紧张局势有了某种程度的缓和的情况下召开的。毫无疑问，一九五四年是在国际紧张局势有了缓和的标志下开始的。这主要是由于柏林四国会议，特别是美国、英国、法国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长在其他国家代表参加下举行的日内瓦会议。在柏林会议上已经证明不能取得更大成
  就，但是所取得的一点点成就也具有重大的国际意义。主要的是：柏林会议打破了阻挠四国举行会谈的障碍，并为日内瓦会议开辟了道路。柏林会议的另一功绩是：它更加清楚地说明了像德国问题这样的问题的解决与保障欧洲安全问题的解决之间的有
  机联系。
      这些问题无疑是有重大的国际意义的，因此，清楚地、正确地规定解决这些问题的办法就特别重要。但是在美国国务卿九月二十三日的演说中没有提出这样的办法。他谈到这个问题时的草草敷衍的几句话纯粹是叙述性的，而且是违反事实的临时凑合起来的一些话，在讨论解决这些问题的方式和方法时，是不能加以考虑的。
    在谈到德国问题时，杜勒斯先生说：“德国分裂状态的持续，不能不带来严重的危险。”
    这一点是大家都只会同意的。但是，真正的危险在哪里呢？难道不在于这样的事实、即：有人不是像苏联所建议的重新建立一个全德政府领导的统
  一的、爱好和平的、民主的和独立的德国，却要努力把德国复活成为一个以凯塞林元帅之流的复仇主义者领导的军国主义国家吗？这种解决德国问题的办法孕育着严重的危险——使在第二次世界大战结束后设法在西德继续存在的军国主义侵略势力猖獗起来的危险，这些势力将违反全欧人民的利益以及德国人民自身的利益而为新战争铺平道路。这就是对欧洲的威胁的真正所在，而且不仅对欧洲，对世界其他地方也是如此。在谈到德国问题时，杜勒斯先生企图把事情说成是仿佛苏联的建议会加深德国的“危险的分裂”似的。这种论断是毫无根据的。相反的，不能帮助把德国统一成一个爱好和平的、民主的独立国家、而只能使德国的分裂状态持续下去的是西方国家的建议。
    因此，苏联才这样坚决一贯地提醒欧洲和全世界，提防来自这一方面，来自法西斯兽窟的威胁，这些法西斯野兽正在等候着发动新战争的时刻，等候着贪财和嗜血的莱因和鲁尔垄断资本家领导的普鲁士—德意志军部的军号声。不能让这样的事情发生。不能允许历史重演；我们不能让我们的子孙经历另一次战争的流血惨剧。
    杜勒斯先生又说：“由于欧洲防务集团的实现最近遭到挫败，欧洲和平问题变得更加错综复杂了。”这个论点也是没有根据的，强使欧洲接受“欧洲防务集团”条约才会使得欧洲和平问题成为错综复杂，因为“欧洲防务集团”是对欧洲人民安全的明显威胁。欧洲人民对这一点认识得太清楚了，他们在为反对这种对他们的利益以及世界所有爱好和平的人民的利益的威胁而斗争。“欧洲防务集团”被说成是合并某些西欧国家武装部队的某种“有机的统一体”，这个事实，据杜勒斯先生说，就会确保它的非侵略性质。
    但是，事实恰好相反。事实说明，西德军国主义者现在已经在千方百计地恢复他们的战争工业和军事力量。如事实上的波恩战争部长布兰克所公开宣布的，首先成立十二师西德武装部队参加“欧洲防务集团”，然后把这个数目增加到六十个师，在两三年内使西德陆军总人数增加到八十万人——从这里可以看到建立未来的“德意志至上”的武装部队的道路，而它无疑是会用火与剑来进攻它的邻国、进攻欧洲其他地方、这样来再度试图让人知道它的厉害的。
    这就是对欧洲安全的威胁的根源。日益迫近的军事风暴的闪电就是从这里发出来的！只有政治上的瞎子和一心要促成另一次世界大战的政治上的赌徒才不能看到这一点。如欧洲的历史所证明的，恢复德国的军事力量无疑会威胁欧洲以及全世界的安全。许多能够冷静地分析事实的有头脑的人认识到了这一点，甚至美国大企业家中也有人认识到了这一点。例如，著名的美国银行家詹姆斯·华伯在他的“德国——和平的关键”一书（一九五三年）中谈到复活德国军国主义的计划时说，美国已经建立或帮助建立一个包括四千八百万满腹忧愁的居民的、新的、分裂的德意志国家，一个威胁着德国人民的未来、威胁着欧洲和平、最后也威胁着美国安全的不合情理的国家。……这个新德国是完全由西方在美国的指导下建立起来的。这不是美国几年前所主张的“新的”和平民主的德国。华伯指出，这还是过去的德国……出生了希特勒的德国、尽管经过了种种政治上的变化仍然设法保存下来的工业巨头和政治官僚们的德国。
    著名的英国历史学家、唐宁街的顾问赫德兰姆·摩莱教授早在一九二五年在他的外交史论文中写道，如果德国完全恢复了它的军事力量，德国军队的矛头像过去一样将总是对准着法国和比利时。但是，德国军国主义所威胁的不仅是法国和比利时的幸福，还有其他欧洲国家，像波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、英国和苏联的幸福。
    有人在谈论防范战争威胁的保证，这种战争是复活了的德国军国主义会提供给欧洲各国人民的。有人在谈论特别的协定，诸如洛迦诺公约。但是当初那些急忙把德国拖进国际联盟的人也说过，洛迦诺公约是“欧洲以及全世界的新时代的开端”。实际上，正如斯大林所说的，洛迦诺公约是配置力量以便迎接另一次战争的计划而不是维护和平的计划。斯大林说，洛迦诺公约是充满着另一次战争的气味的。甚至克利蒙梭也说，洛迦诺公约是“德国会在必要时撕毁的一张废纸”。十年后当希特勒德国片面地撕毁了洛迦诺公约，采取了这个决定性的步骤来准备另一次战争的时候，情况刚好是这样。这一场战争终于在一九三九年—一九四一年爆发了。今天有人把德国一九四一年对苏联的进攻说成是“防御性的战争”，说这在一定程度上是出于德国同它的敌手对比的未来人口状况的考虑，难道这不是企图替德国法西斯分子对民主国家、主要是对苏联所发动的战争辩护吗？难道美国的许多所谓科学家如斯彼克曼、浦桑、斯特劳斯、胡普之流——他们的假科学的垃圾充斥书市——不是十分安然自得地为战争赌博辩护吗？这些先生们竟然说，在第
  二次世界大战期间，“人口论是战争的工具”，“战争是决定各国命运的主要裁判人”，而这个裁判人的决定所依据的因素却是武力。由于美国有势力的军国主义侵略分子的鼓励，上述这些散播很广的被收买的作品在美国都成为畅销书。
    信守条约在帝国主义垄断者中间并不是时髦的。在这方面，已经恢复了旧的（主要是希特勒的）外交传统的西德并不例外。西德现在是在美国和西德的垄断集团、特别是莱因—鲁尔垄断集团的掌握中，莱因—鲁尔垄断集团是德国皇帝的侵略——希特勒和阿登纳的政策都承继了它——的真正执行者。
    在关于“防御”的话句的掩盖下，西德的军国主义化正在全力进行。在备战活动中同西德垄断资本家有长期的公开和隐蔽的合作关系的美国垄断资本家，正在特别努力于重建西德军事力量，这是美国夺取世界霸权的计划中重要的因素。
    这样一种情况着重说明了“欧洲防务集团”的军事侵略性质，这个集团要以西德武装部队为核心，而西德统治集团却蓄意要复仇。波恩联邦议院通过了这样一个企图复仇的决议：“指示政府促使欧洲军条约缔约国注意：德国目前的疆界，不论是在东方还是在西方，都是一点也不适合联邦共和国的。”难道这样一个决议还不足以证明以上所述的东西吗？
    无怪在世界各国，特别是在欧洲国家，包括法国在内，广大的人民运动记取了前两次世界大战的教训，强烈反对批准这个对于法国人民、对于西德的所有邻国以及一切爱好和平人民都十分危险的条约。这个条约在法国的失败是和平力量的一个巨大胜利。这个条约的失败同时也是对于“实力”政策的沉重打击。它是对于战争挑拨者、战争宣传者和组织者的一个严重警告。“欧洲防务集团”的拥护者很自然地要因为这个条约遭到挫折而悲叹，说这是大不幸。同时，他们还在不断找寻能够保证他们的计划（同建立“欧洲防务集团”计划类似的计划）成功的代替品。和平阵营的国家的兴趣同对方阵营的国家的领袖的兴趣是多么不同啊！法国国民议会的拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约，令人信服地说明在欧洲建立互相对立的国家阵线的政策是多么不符合爱好和平的人民的利益。法国议会的上述决定，自然使所有以行动而不是以空谈来支持欧洲各国人民的真正安全、支持巩固普遍和平的人感到满意。
    全世界爱好和平人民认为这一行动对世界命运来说是一件非常幸运的事。另外一些人大概要认为这对世界命运是不幸的。两种不同的态度本身就都说明了问题。
    欧洲安全问题是和德国问题绝对分不开的。在这两个问题上都有着原则上不同的两条政治路线：一条政治路线就是主张建立一个统一、和平和民主的德国，并且成立一个临时的全德政府来执行这个计划，并在举行真正自由和民主的全德选举以召开全德的制宪议会的基础上统一德国。另一条路线就是西方三国的计划中所体现出的路线，它的一个特点就是企图通过履行（用计划中的话来说）波恩政府的国际义务，在今后的五十年中约束未来的全德政府。这种情况当然排斥了德国在这五十年中作为真正的“自由和自主的”国家而行事的任何可能性。另一方面，这个计划并没有规定能够避免或防止军国主义和复仇主义的野心在将来发展的措施。而在另一方面，应该记得，苏联所建议的全欧条约所根据的原则是由参加全欧条约的各国集体防御在欧洲对一个或几个缔约国所发动的武装进攻。参加这个条约的国家保证不参加或缔结任何违反保障欧洲集体安全的目的的联盟、同盟或协定。这样一种欧洲体系就可以为欧洲的安全创造真正的条件。这将是在这个重要的事情中向前迈进的一大步，并且也将为通过建立一个统一、和平、独立和民主的德国解决德国问题创造更有利的条件。现实本身证明，除非欧洲安全问题得到解决，否则解决德国问题是不可能的。
    还应该强调指出，德国问题的解决无疑也会促进奥地利问题的解决。杜勒斯在大会上的发言中也谈到了奥地利问题，他徒劳无功地企图把问题说成是当对奥和约就要签订的时候苏联提出了新的条件。这是不符合事实的。早在一九四九年，四大国除了在某几点之外就基本上就对奥和约取得了一致意见。但是，突然以所谓简要条约的形式提出了新的建议的是西方国家，而这些建议的内容是如此的不可令人接受，以致在两年左右之后，美英法自己都撤回了这个简要条约。但是同时发生了一些不能忽视的情况，这些情况使得对奥和约一定要规定不得以新的德奥合并的计划和由德国和奥地利组成新的军事侵略同盟的计划强加在奥地利身上，并且规定保证奥地利的民主和和平的发展。但是美国一直坚持反对这一点。关于对奥和约的情况就是这样。
    解决朝鲜问题是有很大重要性的。
    大家知道，在日内瓦并没有得出解决朝鲜问题的积极办法。然而，为了朝鲜全国统一和保障世界
  和平的利益，朝鲜问题亟须加以解决。大家知道，由于李承晚分子正在企图有步骤地破坏朝鲜停战和
  重新对朝鲜人民发动战争，解决朝鲜问题就更加必要了。
    解决朝鲜问题这一要求，实际上，是找到门上来了。因此，大会必须尽一切努力来解决这一问题。在日内瓦会议上，苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表团，都曾为和平解决
  这个问题提出过建设性的建议。在日内瓦讨论朝鲜问题期间，苏联代表团和英国代表团的意见曾经较为接近，这两个代表团都认为，规定达成朝鲜问题协议的基本原则是很重要的。这将是在准备恢复朝鲜国家统一方面向前迈进的一大步。但是，其他某些代表团的代表并没有支持这个态度，而比利时的代表甚至说，苏联代表团的建议将会导致对联合国的“可怕的后果”。但是尽管日内瓦会议在讨论朝鲜问题上毫无进展，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团还是为了解决这个问题提出了具体建议，这个建议并从苏联代表团的宣言草案得到补充。这个宣言草案说：“参加日内瓦会议各国业已同意：在等待朝鲜问题在建立一个统一、独立、民主国家的基础上最后解决期间，不得采取任何足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动。与会者表示相信，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国将为和平的利益依照本宣言而行动。”朝鲜问题必须不拖延地予以解决。它的解决无疑由于美国和南朝鲜所签订的所谓“共同防御条约”——一个为利用南朝鲜作为在远东进行战争的桥头堡的计划所决定的条约——而受到严重妨碍。
    我们认为，有关国家应该继续它们的努力，以求达成协议，在建立一个统一、独立、民主国家的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题。
    但是，在欧洲“欧洲防务集团”的垮台和反动集团在阻挠印度支那战争结束方面所遭到的失败，都没有使他们停止进一步努力来阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和，因为国际紧张局势是有利于准备新的世界战争的。马尼拉会议无疑就是这样一个尝试。在马尼拉，以美国为首的若干国家决定成立一个同“北大西洋集团”所追求的目的相同的新集团。美国的宣传竭力把马尼拉会议说成是东南亚集体防御的胜利。但是大多数亚洲国家，如印度、印度尼西亚等共拥有将近四亿五千万人口的国家，都拒绝参加马尼拉会议和马尼拉条约，这件事本身便令人信服地揭穿了这样一种说法的虚伪性：马尼拉会议和它的参与国所签订的条约追求的目的是“防卫”东南亚国家，它们是符合这些国家人民的利益的。这种侵略性计划受到中华人民共和国和它的六亿人民的反对，这件事也证明了这一点。所谓“防卫”东南亚的计划，骨子里是希望借着某些亚洲国家的帮助，
  “在集体的基础上”（像这种计划的某些发起人所说的那样）在亚洲发动武装干涉。这个计划同朝鲜战争计划相似：利用某些亚洲小国的参加作为掩盖殖民主义者在控制这一区域方面的特殊利益的烟幕，来组织外国干涉。这个计划是镇压东南亚国家民族解放运动的计划，它企图使亚洲人打亚洲人。
    为了掩饰这些目的，这些计划的发起人标榜说必须保证亚洲各国人民的“自由”和独立，但是他们却并不隐瞒它们毫不打算给予这种“独立”。重要的事情是把这宣告一番，以便于征募士兵加入傀儡军队，从而更好地掩饰它们自己参与这个军事冒险，掩饰它们对这场战争感兴趣。为了做到这一步，他们又再度打算利用联合国的名义和旗帜，要联合国给这种军事冒险以“道义上的支持”，而组织这种军事冒险却是为了（用美国国务院发言人的话说）保障“受到威胁的重大利益”——主要指美国利益。这些利益是什么呢？根据美国参议院委员会的正式记录，杜勒斯先生在谈到美国在印度支那的利益时说：从战略上说，它们是和所谓沿海岛屿链带密切地连结着的。这条沿海岛屿链带有两个大陆基地：北面的朝鲜大陆和杜勒斯先生所希望的南面的印度支那。此外在它们之间还有一些岛屿：日本、琉球（包括冲绳岛）、台湾、菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰。美国以种种方式达成了保障这些地区中每一个地区的安全的谅解，这种谅解在几种情况下不是采取条约形式，但尽管如此，还是十分真实和十分有效的。过了一些时候，杜勒斯先生又谈到了同一问题。他说印度支那是一个米仓，一个盛产锡、石油、橡胶、铁砂等原料的地区，又说中国大陆的丧失对美国是大不幸，如果除此以外再丧失东南亚和太平洋岛屿的千百万人民、广大的经济资源和战略阵地的话，这种不幸就更加严重了。
    所有这些供认都使人毫不能怀疑：建立马尼拉集团是为了使美国垄断资本家更容易畅所欲为地继续剥削亚洲国家的天然财富和它们的人民。对于剥削亚洲国家的天然资源和人民，自称在“领导世界”的美国垄断资本是特别感到兴趣的，但是受到了东方和亚洲的民族解放运动的胜利的阻碍。
    美国的这种兴趣——他们对世界各地都是如此——浓厚的程度是众所周知的。同样众所周知的是麦金莱总统时代以来美国始终不变地一贯用来保卫这种利益的手段。
    从这些供认中可以明显看出，类似马尼拉条约的发起人所抱着的宗旨、目的和计划，是同和平利益没有丝毫共同之处的。
    这种条约暴露了它们的策划人和参与人的好战计划，它不能使人相信谈论和平愿望的言论，也不能使人相信这样一种强词夺理的说法：这个条约追逐的目标是美国垄断资本所特别垂涎的地区的人民
  的“防御”和“安全”。
    不过半个世纪以前，美国著名法学权威克拉克在他的一个备忘录里写道，没有一个国家像美国政府那样一再地用武装部队暂时占领其他国家的一部
  分领土，他这样说是正确的。从克拉克的备忘录中我们还可以知道，这种干涉采取了实际干涉外国政治事务的形式。
    可敬的国务院法律顾问在那个备忘录中肯定地说，在这种情形之下，通常使用的借口是讲到人类，人性，讲到保护某一个国家的公民等等。这种讲法在今天还是广泛地应用着。
    在马尼拉，也曾有人企图用谈所谓“防御和安全”的目的，来掩饰这种新的侵略行动。这样讲法是骗不了任何人的。
    在组织马尼拉集团的同时，参谋军官们和从事于拟订另一次世界战争的计划的其他专家们，正在进行他们的实际工作。他们正在努力建立一种以所谓“大规模报复”计划为基础的这种军事措施的整个体系。所谓“大规模报复”计划实际上不是任何别的东西，只是一个准备预防性战争的计划。关于报复的说法显然是虚构的。
    这种说法的目的在欺骗舆论，使人们相信目前正在准备的敌对行动只是针对攻击而进行的报复，虽然这种威胁着美国的攻击的神话早就被揭穿了。所谓“大规模报复”计划的主要目的显然是希望发动一次预防性的战争——先发制人。在准备好所谓
  “大规模的报复”的时候，这种准备工作的组织者就从这样的假定出发：对假想中的敌人发动战争是对于美国将军们有利的。
    这种计划是疯狂的希特勒闪电战计划或日本军国主义分子袭击美国珍珠港计划的翻版。杜勒斯在今年年初发表的一次演说中宣传这种“大规模报复”计划时曾说，美国应当在这个世界的任何部分——在北极和热带地区，在亚洲，在近东和欧洲，在海面、陆地和空中，用旧的和新的武器进行打击。
    难道这样公开进攻的威胁还不能揭露杜勒斯喜欢用的说法，所谓“报复性的打击”的真正侵略性目的吗？事实上，在这种情况下，这必然不是报复性的打击，而正是首先动手的打击。说什么这将是“报复性的打击”，其目的是为了掩饰正在准备中的战争的发动。和杜勒斯先生有密切关系的美国原子能委员会前主席戈登·迪安对所谓“报复”政策的目的作了更明确的说明。迪安先生在“原子科学家公报”中直接主张对苏联进行预防性原子战争。
    原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯在参议院拨款委员会中发表了一个同一个调子的演说，他说，根据参谋长联席会议的意见，应该利用热核子武器的所有的好处来保证美国的优势。
    根据大规模使用原子武器和氢武器这些典型的进攻武器的方针，正在采取措施来在军队中尽量利用原子武器和有“老实的琼斯”、“卡普罗尔”、
  “雷格列斯”等式原子弹头的火箭炮。执迷不悟的军国主义者正在宣传原子大炮的威力，来煽动好战情绪。他们说，这种大炮将能在敌人的前线炸开
  “宽阔的通路”，而进攻部队将冲进这些“裂口”取得胜利……。
    什么都算计得一清二楚了。对于这种“乌拉”的主战论者的胡扯，我们人民有一句俗话说：“纸上看来倒容易，但是忘记了山谷。而这却正是不得不越过的。”这确实是不应该忘记的。
    原子武器的储存在美国政策中占着头等重要的地位，这一点可以从美国原子能委员会的半年报告中看出。
    从这个报告中，我们知道，例如，总量正在迅速增加的国家原子武器储存量，反映了发展这种武器的更多种类和多样型式的倾向。“这类武器”的发展扩大了现有的可分裂物质的军事用途范围。在发展原子武器的同时，热核子武器的配合的研究工作从一九五零年起也发展了。根据这个报告看来，已作出了一个国家政治决定以便利用各种可能务使美国保持它的优势。根据这个决定，总统已训令委员会在一九五四年继续生产原子武器。
    大家知道，预算能最好地反映一个国家的生活。现在我不细谈这个问题，我只想提一下西方国家的预算中突出地表现了军国主义政策。美国的预算尤其是这样。如果把美国在本会计年度的军事开支和在社会保险、公共卫生、教育和房屋建设方面的预算开支比较一下，就可以看出：在这些方面的预算开支只占全部开支的百分之四点二，而全部开支的百分之六十六是拨充直接军事用途的。这个比较本身就可以说明问题。
    说明美国今年预算特点的上述数字还可以具体地说明，“实力地位”政策实际上代表着什么，不得不忍受教育、卫生事业和社会保险削减之苦的纳税者的负担是多么沉重。
    在另一方面，控制着所有战争物资定货的最大的垄断企业，在制造原子武器方面获得了令人难以置信的利润。对他们来说，生产原子能以供和平用途，在经济上是没有很大的利益的，顺便说一句，对美国主要政界人物也是如此。据有资格的人士说，美国的一座原子发电站要到今后三四年才能发电，而苏联已经建立了一座原子发电站，这不是偶然的事情。苏联这座电力站的开始发电已带来了真正的工业——技术革命。这一事实加强了对原子能为人类的和平需要服务的伟大前途的信心，但在同时，它也引起了黩武主义者阵营的严重不安，正如大家所知道的，这些人对于生产原子能以供和平用途是不感到兴趣的。无数的事实说明，这些人对于这种进展是很不重视的，他们所有的注意力和精力都集中在尽量发展原子武器的生产上。一方面，他们继续把他们的计划建筑在他们所说的原子军备的
  优势上，另一方面，他们继续要维持国际紧张局势并使它进一步恶化。这些人所喜欢的是战争繁荣和
  “实力地位”政策。这种政策也适合以海军上将雷
  德福和格仑瑟将军这样的军事领袖为代表的有力的军事集团的胃口的，他们现在正在从事拟订所谓长
  期战略，这种战略以一场使用原子武器和氢武器的
  预防性战争为其枢纽。
    在西方各国，特别是在美国，过去一年的特点是加速军备竞赛。在美国，原子武器和氢武器的储
  存特别说明了这一点，这种储存反映在原子能委员会支出的增加上，这是以往几年来为了这个目的而付出的最大的支出。因此，把原子能用于如杜勒斯先生所说的死亡工具而不是用来作为繁荣的来源的紧张竞争在继续着。
    早在去年，苏联政府就对十二月八日的建议着
  重指出了像把原子能用于和平用途的实际可能性这样一个事实的极其重要的意义，并且同意就这个问题展开谈判。一九五四年一月三十日—二月二日，苏联政府交给美英法三国政府一项关于无条件地不使用原子武器、氢武器或任何其他大规模毁灭性武器的宣言草案。这个宣言的序言中谈到决心要拯救人类免于使用原子武器、氢武器或其他大规模毁灭性武器的破坏性战争的威胁。同时强调必须努力用各种方法促使把原子能方面的科学发现只用于和平目的，用于增进各国人民的福利和改善他们的生活条件。
    苏联政府从这样的假定出发：不仅是一部分，而是全部原子原料应该完全用于和平目的，在这方面的科学成就应该为经济和文化进步的目的服务，而不是为战争和大规模消灭人民的目的服务。苏联政府从这样的前提出发：这样将为工业、农业和运输业的发展，为医药上的应用，为改进技术和促进科学进步开辟空前的机会。苏联政府从这样的事实出发：美国的十二月八日建议并不能有助于消除原子战争的威胁，而这种威胁特别由于毁灭力越来越强大的新型原子武器和氢武器的出现而日益引起许多国家的焦虑。至于议程上的新项目——在发展原子能和平用途方面的国际合作——这个问题应当在将来收到更具体的建议和有关材料时再予以讨论。
    苏联和美国就这个问题所交换的文件已经公布。由于这些文件的交换，就有可能对苏联主张在原子能用于和平用途方面应采取的步骤这一问题上的态度，作一番详尽的研究。在这方面，我对于杜勒斯先生在大会上演说时的做法和洛奇先生在总务委员会上的做法，不能不感到惊诧，洛奇先生竟说苏联政府拒绝了关于举行谈判以讨论关于原子能用于和平用途的措施的建议。
    为了说明这种说法的完全站不住脚，只要举出苏联政府在四月二十七日给美国的备忘录就够了，这个备忘录中说：“苏联政府一贯诚心要加强国际和平，在目前的情况下特别是要促使原子战争威胁得以消除，因此，苏联政府表示准备随时参加相应的谈判。”
    在九月二十二日的备忘录里（其内容当然是杜勒斯先生和洛奇先生在联合国里讲话前就知道的），苏联政府宣布“准备继续举行这种谈判，来研究苏联政府的和美国政府的建议”。
    任何企图把苏联在这个问题上的态度说成是苏联在参加目的在把原子能用于和平用途的措施之前坚持某种先决条件的态度，也是毫无根据的。还应当提到这一事实，十二月八日的建议并没有谈到不得使用原子武器，并忽视各国人民不断提出的关于禁止原子武器和把它们从各国军备中取消的要求。
    在这个问题上采取这种态度是不符合维持和平和保障各国人民安全的要求的。苏联认为必须达成一个足以防止原子能用于军事用途并使它仅用于和平用途的国际协定。在和平使用原子能的国际合作方面达成协定的可能性，还远没有殆尽。这是我们深刻的信念。至于我们主张各国宣布放弃使用原子武器和氢武器的建议，毫无疑问，达成这种协定的需要不但远没有消除，而是越来越迫切了。我们绝不能允许目的在把原子能用于和平用途的措施变为把原子能用于继续从事原子军备竞赛的工具。但是，这种危险还是存在的。著名的艾奇逊—巴鲁克—李连塞尔关于原子能管制计划的草拟者之一伯纳德·巴鲁克先生就指出这一点，他在论当代哲学的小册子中作了一个重要的招认。巴鲁克先生在他的小册子里写道，不管对于这个国际储存作怎样的贡献，不同的国家将仍旧把大部分可分裂物质用来发展原子武器和其他核子武器。原子攻击的危险将不会减少，原子军备竞赛将不会放松。
    过去一年表明，自从原子共储的建议提出来之后，美国不但没有放松军备竞赛、核子武器的储存和其他军事侵略措施，反而更加紧了这些措施，特别是在核子武器方面。
    今年的许多事实表明，美国在外交政策方面仍然是指靠实力政策。因此，决定美国政府各种军事措施的政策是以原子弹为中心的，而原子弹则被正式宣布为有效地执行美国政策的基础。这种政策在国内制造战争心理，煽动对别国人民的敌意和仇视，鼓励鼓吹新世界大战的宣传，这样就必然会导向扩充军备，在外国领土上建立愈来愈多的基地，在防御臆造的来自共产主义国家的威胁这种谎话的掩饰下，拼凑新的军事集团。
    日内瓦会议的成功打破了“实力政策”拥护者的侵略算盘，美国政策在批准所谓“欧洲防务集团”方面遭到了失败，阻挠印度支那停战这一阴谋也失败了，所有这一切都促使某些国家——包括美国和它的西欧盟国——的反动派采取新的阴谋，来阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和和国际关系的正常化。
    毫无疑问，这些阴谋同样是注定要失败的，因为人民要求和平的意志在日益强大，而战争的势力在日益削弱。
    “实力政策”也是美国垄断资本家用来将军事景气保持在尽可能高的水平上的重要工具，他们企图以此来阻止已经来到的美国的周期性危机的发展，并进一步靠军事订货发财。
    美国的危机趋势也对其他西欧各国以及农业国和殖民地国家的经济情况发生严重的不利影响。美国的经济政策以及它的高额关税和优先购买美国商品等等法律，妨碍着西欧各国对美国的出口，引起了西欧各国的“美元荒”，由于美国对中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国采取贸易限制和禁运措施以及其他严重危害西欧各国的类似措施，这种“美元荒”愈来愈严重了。如果西欧各国摆脱加在它们身上的同苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家进行贸易方面的限制，它们就可以容易地消除这种“美元荒”。根据专家的计算，把自东欧、苏联和中华人民共和国的进口恢复到巴特尔法和其他类似的限制措施生效以前的水平，仅在小麦、玉蜀黍、大麦、烟叶、木材、原油、石油产品这样一些商品方面，就可以使西欧各国节省大约六亿美元。
    很明显，消除贸易和整个经济关系正常化的人为障碍是迫切需要的。这是符合一切国家人民的根本的、切身的利益的。这是符合和平和国际安全的利益的。这也是落后国家的利益所需要的，它们特别需要废除禁运和其他类似的贸易限制。这是符合和平与国际安全的利益的。贸易是一个重要的因素，它能使人们互相接近，消除互不信任，保证真正和平共处的可能性。全世界广泛地展开了争取国际经济关系、特别是贸易的正常化的运动，这是十分自然的。值得提出的是，美国援外事务管理署最近的一个报告中指出，西欧愈来愈广泛的人士认为东西方之间的贸易有着远大的前途，对于西欧各国说来，这种贸易可以成为真正“丰饶之角”，使它们能消除失业现象、贫困和外汇困难，能够奠定持久和稳定的和平的基础。
    最近一年来的经验证明：世界各国压倒多数的企业界人士力求扩大同苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的贸易和经济关系，他们认识到并看到，这种关系为他们的经济、文化和政治幸福开辟了多么广阔的远景。
    英国“经济学家”杂志最近刊载了英国全国总商会副会长的一篇谈话，他说，不久的将来扩大海外市场的最大希望在于增加东西方贸易。
    那么，诸位先生，问题的决定性关键在哪里呢？是什么东西在阻挠它呢？是巴特尔法和各种各样的限制在阻挠，为了不辜负全世界的希望，必须消除这些障碍。
    苏联所走的道路是同一切国家扩大和发展彼此的关系，只要它们也愿意这样做。苏联的对外贸易关系每年都在扩大。苏联现在的对外贸易额增加到一九四八年的二倍。生活本身在粉碎某些人用来束缚苏联和西欧国家的经济关系的桎梏。苏联和西欧国家的关系正在不断发展，以互相信任和尊重彼此利益和好处的空气来活跃着国际政治气氛。
    以巩固并自由地、广泛地发展国际经济关系为目的的苏联对外贸易政策，是苏联外交政策的不可分割的一部分，苏联的外交政策表达了苏联人民要和各国人民和平、友好相处、并巩固和平和国际安全的坚强决心。
    伟大的苏维埃国家缔造者列宁在三十多年前谈到热那亚会议时指出，苏维埃共和国和资本主义国家之间的合作是可能的，甚至是必然的，他说：
    “须知，资本主义列强近几年来最迫切、最必要、最实际和最显明暴露出来的利益，是要求发展、调整和扩大对俄国的通商关系。既然有了这样的利益，那么就是辩论，就是争执，就是在各种提议上发生分歧——甚至很可能走到决裂，——但归根到底，这个基本的经济上的必要性终究会给自己开拓进路。……可以相当自信地说，苏维埃共和国与其余一切资本主义国家之间的正常商业关系，是必然会向前进展的。”
    苏联坚决地、始终如一地保卫和平，坚决主张采取能够防止另一次世界大战的威胁、从而防止无法计算的新灾难和千百万人民的牺牲的重要的、根本的措施。
    在联合国大会每一届会议上，苏联一直是致力于谋求这一重要问题的圆满解决的。苏联深信，联合国大会应当而且能够解决这一问题，实现要求和平和安全的各国人民的愿望。
    根据以上所说，苏联代表团提出下列决议草案，供联合国大会第九届会议考虑：
    “关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约（条约）
      第一部分
    大会训令联合国裁减军备委员会起草一项国际公约（条约）草案，提交安全理事会通过，这个公约以加强和平和国际安全为目的，并以法国和英国一九五四年六月十一日的建议为基础，规定禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器，从国家的军备中取消这些武器，大量裁减军备，并建立国际监督制度以监督这些决定的实施。
    按照这一点，公约（条约）应包含下列基本规定：
    一、同时实施下列措施：
    甲、各国应在六个月（或一年）内把军备、武装部队和国家军事需要预算拨款加以削减，削减的数量为一致同意的定额的百分之五十。军备及武装部队的裁减应以一九五三年十二月三十一日的军备及武装部队的水平为起算点，拨款的削减应以截至一九五三年十二月三十一日为止的一年度的军事需要费用的水平为起算点。
    乙、为了监督各国履行甲项所规定的裁减军备及武装部队的义务，应在安全理事会下成立一个临时国际监督委员会，委员会有权要求各国提供必需的关于采取裁减军备及武装部队的措施的情报。委员会应采取必要措施监督各国履行裁减军备及武装部队和削减军事需要拨款的义务。各国应按具体规定的时间定期向委员会提供关于实施公约中所规定的措施的情报。
    二、为了使第一节规定的措施完备起见，下列措施应予同时执行：
    甲、各国应在六个月（或一年）内把军备、武装部队和国家军事需要预算拨款再削减一致同意的定额的百分之五十，军备及武装部队的裁减以一九五三年十二月三十一日的军备及武装部队水平为起算点，拨款的削减以截至一九五三年十二月三十一日为止的一年度的军事需要费用水平为起算点。
    乙、完全禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器，停止制造这些类型的武器，并从国家军备中完全取消这些武器；一切现有的原子原料都只应用于和平用途。
    所有这些措施实施完毕的日期不得迟于第二节甲项所规定的裁减军备及武装部队的措施的实施。一俟开始把军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款再削减一致同意的定额的百分之五十，就应立即停止制造原子武器及氢武器。
    丙、各国应建立永久性的国际机构，以监督实施关于禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器、停止这些武器的制造、从国家军备中取消这些武器、并削减军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款的公约（条约）。此外，应该授权这样一个国际机构在保证一切国家实施上述公约所必需的规模上进行监督，包括在永久性基础上进行视察。
    第二部分
    至于法国和英国一九五四年六月十一日提出的关于除为防御侵略外禁止使用核子武器的备忘录中包含的建议，联合国大会训令联合国裁减军备委员会研究和明确这个问题，并提出建议。”
    主席先生、诸位代表先生，
    苏联代表团在提出这些建议的时候，深信这些建议将得到最仔细的研究，深信这些建议是足以帮助联合国在反对扩充军备、反对另一次战争威胁、维护和平和国际安全的斗争中履行自己的职责。
              （新华社据塔斯社纽约一日电）
