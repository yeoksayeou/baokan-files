What Kind of Road to Take?
    — Re-evaluating Mr. Yu Pingbo’s Erroneous Views on “Dream of the Red Chamber” Research
    Li Xifan, Lan Ling
In recent years, the People's Publishing House has extensively compiled and published excellent classical Chinese literary works, and works on classical literature research have gradually emerged. In the prefaces of these works, many authors express a common hope: to help the general readership better understand classical works through their writings. This aspiration is sincere and welcome. However, the key issue lies in how they actually study these classical works. A careful review of relevant books and magazines will reveal that works that truly utilize correct viewpoints and methods to comprehensively analyze and critique the ideas of an author or the content of a work are few and far between, while a large number of textual researches on the author's life and the details of the works are lengthy and repetitive. Sometimes, people really doubt whether the "textual research" era of the "national heritage" masters has been resurrected. Of course, we do not deny the importance of textual research. In future research on classical literature, it is still necessary to use correct viewpoints and methods to conduct textual research and collation work. But the problem also lies in the viewpoints and methods.

Many research works treat Marxism as a fashionable coat, while still peddling old goods at heart, without touching on the actual content of the works, fragmenting the artistic images in the works, obscuring the social role of excellent classical literary works through extremely covert means, and spreading poisonous things to the broad masses of young people. This is essentially a reappearance of a bourgeois reactionary trend of thought that occurred thirty years ago. This is not accidental, but a reflection of the complex class struggle in the transitional period in the field of literary research. All old and reactionary ideological viewpoints are by no means willing to withdraw from this position, but are stubbornly resisting. If we turn a blind eye to this phenomenon, do not draw a clear line with it, do not launch a fierce struggle, and do not thoroughly eliminate it, this will not only poison the younger generation of readers, but also harm the classical literary heritage and the research work on classical literature. On this issue, we cannot but repeatedly mention Mr. Yu Pingbo.

Mr. Yu Pingbo is a well-known researcher of classical literature, who has been engaged in the study of *Dream of the Red Chamber* for more than thirty years. His *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification*, written thirty years ago, the *Dream of the Red Chamber Research* published after the liberation and revised, and the recent short essays scattered in various newspapers and periodicals, especially the *Brief Discussion on Dream of the Red Chamber* [1] as his comprehensive and summarizing article on *Dream of the Red Chamber*, are widely attracting readers. However, what kind of road is such a classical literature researcher with more than thirty years of history taking? Mr. Yu Pingbo's first work on *Dream of the Red Chamber*, *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification*, was written in 1922. This work, which comprehensively covers various issues of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, was once a popular representative of the so-called "New Redology" along with Hu Shih's *Textual Research on Dream of the Red Chamber*. It laid the foundation for Mr. Yu Pingbo's research. Later, most of his articles were based on this. Its basic arguments have run through *Dream of the Red Chamber Research* and *Brief Discussion on Dream of the Red Chamber*, guiding the entire process of Mr. Yu Pingbo's research on *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Therefore, it is completely necessary to comprehensively analyze and criticize Mr. Yu Pingbo's research work starting from *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification*, and to seriously evaluate his role on the ideological front.

Around 1922, due to the drastic changes in China's political situation and the wider and deeper spread of Marxism in China, the united front of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal New Culture Movement during the "May Fourth" period began to split. Communist intellectuals and bourgeois intellectuals parted ways. Petty-bourgeois intellectuals also diverged in two directions. As Mr. Lu Xun said: "Some were promoted, some retreated, some advanced, and I experienced once again that comrades in the same battle line would still change so much" [2]. In order to safeguard the narrow interests of their class, bourgeois intellectuals abandoned the anti-feudal cultural struggle, turned their spearhead, and directly confronted Marxism, attempting to prevent the spread and application of Marxism in China.

Hu Shih, an intellectual representing the comprador bourgeoisie, in order to resist the propaganda of Marxism, put forward the slogan of "researching more problems and talking less about doctrines" [3] in politics, and the reactionary experimentalist "textual research" in academics. Hu Shih's purpose in advocating "textual research" was very clear. He said:

	“Young friends, do not regard these novel textual researches as
    I am teaching you to read the words of novels. These are just some examples
    of methods of thinking about problems. In these words, I want readers
    to learn a little scientific spirit, a little scientific attitude, and a little scientific
    method. The scientific attitude lies in seeking facts and seeking truth. The scientific
    attitude lies in setting aside prejudices, setting aside emotions, recognizing only
    facts, and following only evidence. The scientific method is only the ten words
    'bold hypothesis, careful verification'. Without evidence, it can only be suspended
    indefinitely; if the evidence is insufficient, it can only be hypothesized, not arbitrarily
    asserted; it must be confirmed before it can be regarded as a conclusion. ...

	I have thousands of words here, and I just want to teach people a method of not being
    deceived. Being led by the nose by Confucius and Zhu Xi is certainly not
    clever; being led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin is not a
    good fellow. I myself never want to lead anyone by the nose. I only
    hope to do my best to teach my young friends to learn a little
    self-defense skill, and strive to be a person who is not deceived.”
      (Preface to Hu Shih's Selected Works)

Leaving aside Hu Shih's historical "works," in the field of literary research, he practiced this proposition with "Textual Research on Dream of the Red Chamber" and other formalist "textual research" articles.

The reactionary purpose of the academic path advocated by Hu Shih was to obstruct the spread of Marxism among young people, leading them blindly into the pile of "national heritage," disconnecting them from reality, and avoiding the sharp class struggle at that time.

In literary research, Mr. Yu Pingbo's "Dream of the Red Chamber Identification" is precisely a loyal follower and practitioner of this path. According to Mr. Yu Pingbo himself, before Hu Shih put forward these slogans, he had "no interest in systematic research" on Dream of the Red Chamber. After Hu Shih's "Textual Research on Dream of the Red Chamber" was published, "then the interest in research infected me." At this time, Mr. Yu Pingbo officially began to systematically study Dream of the Red Chamber. Hu Shih and Yu Pingbo discussed Dream of the Red Chamber in the form of correspondence, echoing each other, so that their "long-held hope of pleasure was actually realized at this time." This is naturally a matter of great joy, because "Dream of the Red Chamber Identification" completely practiced their proposition.

However, to guide people away from reality and avoid social class struggle, it is first necessary to deny that literature is an artistic means for human beings to understand and reflect life. Because explaining realistic literature is precisely through the method of typifying the essence of social life phenomena, revealing the laws of social development, educating and transforming people's souls, and thus promoting social transformation. This is the true mission of realistic literature, and it is also the central issue to be clarified by literary research and literary criticism. In order to achieve their goals, the "New Redology School" first denied that *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a realistic work. The central purpose of Hu Shih's *Textual Research on Dream of the Red Chamber* is to use textual research to prove that *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a work that records facts, and its value lies in this "plain and unremarkable" record of facts.

Mr. Yu Pingbo is also advancing along this path. *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification* separately examines the factual truth of various plots in the book, believing that the Jia surname is the Cao surname, using Cao Xueqin's family history to prove Jia Baoyu, using the image of Jia Baoyu to prove Cao Xueqin's life experience, and piecing together individual words or plots in the book to determine a person's ending. Mr. Yu Pingbo turned the work of researching and analyzing artistic images into "picking bones and extracting thorns," dissecting the characters with trivial textual research. In this way, it completely reached the same conclusion as Hu Shih, that *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a naturalistic work, thus negating the realistic social content of *Dream of the Red Chamber*.

However, the experimentalist "textual research" cannot cover up its idealistic tail. *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification*, while arguing from many aspects that *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a record of facts, often falls into self-contradiction, sometimes saying that it is an "autobiography," and sometimes saying that it is "performing the concept of emptiness." If it is a fact, how can it be performed? If it is "performing the concept of emptiness," where are the facts? This is the sorrow of the self-contradiction that experimentalist "textual research" cannot eliminate.

Literary understanding and reflection of reality is not the purpose itself, but lies in awakening people to transform reality. *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification*, while negating the social content of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, also negates its social function; that is, its anti-feudal tendency. *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification* says in the chapter "A General Comparison of the Gao Ben and Qi Ben": "According to the Gao Ben, Dream of the Red Chamber is literature, which awakens infatuation and cultivates temperament; according to the Qi Ben, Dream of the Red Chamber is an idle book, which is vying for beauty and charm, and drinking with meals." These two judgments completely erase the ideological nature of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Judging from either judgment, *Dream of the Red Chamber* has lost its true value and has become something that expresses abstract "human nature." Thus, from the point of view of the "autobiographical concept," *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a meaningless work. Listen to what Mr. Yu Pingbo says: "Looking at it calmly, the position of *Dream of the Red Chamber* in world literature is not very high. This kind of novel, and all Chinese literature—poetry, ci, qu—are on the same plane. The characteristic of this kind of literature is at most a reflection of personal life experience and personality. Although *Dream of the Red Chamber*'s attitude has the three layers mentioned above, it is still nothing more than a feeling of life experience and complaints. Even the later repentance and enlightenment, as I speculate from the wedge, cannot get rid of the stereotype of oriental thought; but because the old love is hard to give up, life is drifting, and regret has no way to go, it is paid for with a cry, and then it is published as an article to complain and relieve oneself. Its use is also nothing more than breaking boredom, waking up the eyes, avoiding the world and eliminating sorrow. Therefore, the nature of *Dream of the Red Chamber* is similar to that of Chinese idle books, and it cannot enter the forest of modern literature." (Dream of the Red Chamber Identification, Volume 2, pp. 21-22) Although Mr. Yu Pingbo deleted this passage in the book "Dream of the Red Chamber Research," his attempt to belittle Dream of the Red Chamber still exists.

In this way, *Dream of the Red Chamber* is injected with a disinfectant, eliminating its "dangerous" function, which is greatly beneficial to the feudal class. Here, Mr. Yu Pingbo's purpose in regarding *Dream of the Red Chamber* as Cao Xueqin's "autobiography" is completely exposed. Not only that, in Mr. Yu Pingbo's consistent understanding, all Chinese classical literature is worthless. What is said in the above passage is relatively mild, but in other places in *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification* it is very blatant: "All Chinese novels are actor literature, so they only know how to please customers," "The unofficial history referred to by Cao Xueqin is probably *Jin Ping Mei*." At the same time, he is also dissatisfied with *Water Margin*'s "rewarding bandits and demoting military officers," and satirizes and ridicules *The Scholars* for "singing and sighing endlessly about the village elders' opera." This is obviously opposed to the works' praise and love for the people. Holding a nihilistic negative attitude towards the excellent cultural heritage of the motherland is precisely the true color of the foreign-style gentlemen after the "May Fourth" Movement. Starting from this reactionary nihilistic negation theory, it will inevitably lead to the loss of national self-confidence.

From the above analysis, it is not difficult to see what kind of stuff the "historical concept" that the "New Redologists" of the Hu Shih school flaunted as "this kind of literature, which seems to be the textual research of experts, can actually give a group of people historical concepts" is. Some people say that Mr. Yu Pingbo is not famous for his views, but for his textual research methods. Then, let's take a look at the essence of his textual research methods.

*Dream of the Red Chamber Identification* focuses on textual research on facts and avoids talking about content, which is exactly the method flaunted by Hu Shih. Hu Shih said in his *Textual Research on Dream of the Red Chamber*:

	“I think we can only start with these
    two questions when doing textual research on Dream of the Red Chamber; we can only use
    the materials we can collect as much as possible, refer to each other for verification, and then draw some relatively reasonable
    conclusions. This is the method of textual research. ... Try to set aside all preconceived
    notions everywhere; always have the purpose of searching for evidence,
    respect evidence everywhere, and let the evidence guide me to a corresponding conclusion. ... But I am confident that this method of textual research
    ... has never been used by people who have studied Dream of the Red Chamber. I hope
    my little contribution can arouse everyone's interest in studying Dream of the Red Chamber, and can guide future Dream of the Red Chamber research onto the right track: breaking the previous kinds of far-fetched 'Redology' and creating a scientific method of Dream of the Red Chamber research!” (Textual Research on Chinese Chapter Novels, pp. 232-233)

We believe that it is completely necessary to conduct textual research on the author's family history and life experience, but it must be meaningful under the premise of analyzing the content of the work. However, Hu Shih and his loyal follower Mr. Yu Pingbo, because of "textual research," obliterated the rich social content of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, fragmented the complete artistic image, and left only a few factual bases that could satisfy Mr. Yu Pingbo's "research interest."

How does *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification* conduct textual research?

Mr. Yu Pingbo said: "We have a most important concept, *Dream of the Red Chamber* is the author's autobiography," "Since we know it is an autobiography, of course the characters and events in the book are real and not fictional." Starting from this "most important concept," it is a most convenient path to find factual basis to prove it. On the surface, this "most important concept" does not come out of thin air, but comes from certain words in the author's self-narration. However, *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a literary work. It is not surprising that it has some facts as a blueprint, but it is by no means a record of facts. If you believe that all the words in the author's self-narration are facts, you should also believe that Jia Baoyu is the incarnation of that big stone, and believe that there is really a Land of Illusion. In this way, I am afraid that Mr. Yu Pingbo's textual research will have to go to great lengths.

Mr. Yu Pingbo's "most important concept" is a one-sided subjective assumption, and its practical purpose is to extract facts from the work that are of "interest" to him to prove his assumption, so that the artistic image in the objective work is subject to his subjective textual research. In the textual research work of literary research, this is a thorough experimentalist method. The "textual research" method of "bold hypothesis, careful verification" advocated by Hu Shih is fully embodied in *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification* or *Dream of the Red Chamber Research*. The so-called "bold hypothesis" is to create subjective concepts regardless of the true phenomenon of all objective things; the so-called "careful verification" is to make all objective things conform to this subjective judgment. Making the objective subject to the subjective is the unity of the epistemology and methodology of experimentalist subjective idealism. The source of Mr. Yu Pingbo's methodology of textual research on *Dream of the Red Chamber* comes from this.

Although *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification* avoids talking about the content of *Dream of the Red Chamber* on the surface, it actually severely criticizes and distorts the content of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. From the conclusion of each textual research, it can be seen that he distorts *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Mr. Yu Pingbo only replaced the principles of literary criticism with the method of textual research, which is closely related to his experimentalist point of view. Therefore, his criticism shows a strong subjective color. (We have already discussed this in our article reviewing "Dream of the Red Chamber Research," so we will omit it here.)

From this, it can be seen that the foundation of Mr. Yu Pingbo's methodology is precisely experimentalist subjective idealism. Those who metaphysically attempt to oppose method and viewpoint are greatly deceived here.

In the preface written by Mr. Gu Jiegang for *Dream of the Red Chamber Identification*, Yu Pingbo and Hu Shih are flaunted as the "New Redology School," and it is "hoped that everyone will see the overthrow of this old Redology and the establishment of the new Redology." So, what is the essence of this "New Redology"? To sum up, there are three points.

First, the research attitude of the "New Redology" is new on the surface, but old at heart. Mr. Yu Pingbo said in 1921:
    "Everything in Beijing is depressing (the military police at Xinhuamen injured faculty and staff), and there is nothing more to say; it is better to talk about *Dream of the Red Chamber* as a magical way to spend the summer, because every time I write, I must be as if divinely assisted." (Gu Preface to "Dream of the Red Chamber Identification") Avoiding the political struggle at that time and diving into *Dream of the Red Chamber* to entertain oneself, the cowardly nature of the scholar-official class who escaped reality is fully exposed. This is truly inheriting the worst tradition of the old Redologists.

Second, the "New Redologists" claim that "the method of research has been changed"; "people in the past did not pay attention to actual materials, but paid attention to the sharpness of speculation, so they liked to use meditation to seek explanations," while the "New Redologists" "always use actual materials as a guide" and "use new methods to drive actual materials" to explain subjective meditation. The so-called "new" method is the method of splitting hairs under the guidance of the new reactionary experimentalist philosophy, which is indeed not available to the old Redologists. In the final analysis, they make *Dream of the Red Chamber* conform to their experimentalist textual research, which is precisely their proud "correct" scientific method and the most "effective" method.

	Third, the "New Redologists" once wanted to run a
    monthly magazine for research on Dream of the Red Chamber, calling on "people to form companions, and then walk
    through the places we have walked to," guiding readers to escape the political struggle of reality and avoid the
    "dangerous" influence of Marxism, so that they can safely go to Dream of the Red Chamber to
    "spend the summer," "the more fierce the debate," the farther away from reality, the better. Using these
    things to influence readers, so that they "unconsciously develop
    their historical concepts and scientific methods," and become experimentalist
    believers.

In short, the essence of "New Redology" lies in the fact that it is a hybrid of the consciousness of the scholar-official class and comprador thought, and it is the specific manifestation of reactionary experimentalism in the field of classical literature research. Although the achievements have not been many in recent decades, the impact has not been small. It has dominated the research on Dream of the Red Chamber in the past, and it is still the case to a certain extent today.

But after liberation, under the new political conditions, Mr. Yu Pingbo not only did not make a profound review of his past research work and its influence, but instead repackaged his old works and republished them, which is the "Dream of the Red Chamber Research" published in 1952. "Dream of the Red Chamber Research" deleted individual chapters, details, and years of writing from the old works, and arranged them together with the supplemented new works, and published them in the new era. Therefore, we have every reason to believe that it is a new work. In addition to providing some new textual research materials and slightly revising individual words and surface conclusions, the new work retains the stance, viewpoints, and methods in its bones without any change. Mr. Yu Pingbo publicly sold Hu Shih's experimentalism to the academic community and the broad masses of young readers in a hidden way, so that it was resurrected in the Chinese academic community.

However, not only was this phenomenon not opposed, but some people praised Mr. Yu Pingbo's textual research work. This kind of "praise and criticism" not only concealed all of Mr. Yu Pingbo's mistakes, but also helped his poisonous ideas to be successfully spread to young people. From here, we can also see more clearly how Hu Shih's reactionary ideological poison that Mr. Yu Pingbo inherited is struggling in the complex environment of class struggle in the transitional period. We should not underestimate its harm to the broad masses of readers. It will appear in various guises now and in the future. If we want to study Dream of the Red Chamber, we should first criticize Mr. Yu Pingbo's erroneous viewpoints and methods; if we want to study the entire classical literary heritage, we must criticize the same viewpoints and methods—that is, the poison of reactionary experimentalist philosophy spread by Hu Shih in the Chinese academic community for a long time in the past. Only in this way can we truly make our classical literature research work embark on the correct and healthy path, and can we truly establish the glorious banner of Marxism in the field of classical literature research, illuminating our way forward.

    走什么样的路？
    ——再评俞平伯先生关于“红楼梦”研究的错误观点
    李希凡　蓝翎
    近几年来，人民出版机关大量整理和出版了中国优秀的古典文学作品，研究古典文学的著作也逐渐出现了。在这些著作的序文中，许多作者都表示出一个共同的希望，企图通过自己的著作帮助广大读者更好地认识古典作品。这种愿望是诚恳的，是值得欢迎的。但是问题的关键在于他们究竟是怎样研究了这些古典作品。只要我们认真地翻阅一下有关的书刊杂志，将不难发现，真正地运用正确的观点和方法去全面地分析和批评一个作家的思想或一部作品的内容的著作却是微乎其微的，而大量的关于作者身世和作品细节的考证却是连篇累牍。有时人们真会怀疑，难道“国故”大家们的“考据”时代又借尸还魂了吗？当然，我们并不抹煞考证工作的重要性。在今后对古典文学的研究中，运用正确的观点和方法进行考证和校勘工作，仍然是必要的。但是问题也就发生在观点和方法上面。
    有很多研究著作是把马克思主义当作一件时髦的外衣，骨子里仍然贩卖着旧货色，不触及作品的实际内容，割裂作品中的艺术形象，通过极其隐蔽的方式，抹煞优秀的古典文学作品的社会作用，向广大青年群众传播有毒的东西。这实质上是三十年前曾经发生过的一次资产阶级反动思潮的再现。这并不是偶然的，而是过渡时期复杂的阶级斗争在文学研究领域中的反映。一切旧有的反动的思想观点绝不甘心退出这一阵地，而是顽强地反抗着的。我们如果对这种现象熟视无睹，不和它划清界限，不展开激烈的斗争，不彻底地肃清它，这将不仅毒害了年青一代的读者，同时也将戕害了古典文学遗产和对古典文学的研究工作。在这个问题上，我们不能不一再谈到俞平伯先生。
    俞平伯先生是大家熟知的古典文学的研究者，他从事红楼梦的研究已经三十多年。他三十年前写的“红楼梦辨”、解放以后修改出版的“红楼梦研究”，以及最近散见于各报刊的短论，尤其是作为他对红楼梦全面的总结性的文章“红楼梦简论”〔一〕，是广泛地吸引着读者的。但是，这样一个具有三十多年历史的古典文学研究者，究竟走着什么样的道路呢？俞平伯先生的第一部研究红楼梦的著作“红楼梦辨”写于一九二二年。这部全面涉及到红楼梦各种问题的著作，曾经是风行一时的、和胡适之的“红楼梦考证”并称的所谓“新红学”的代表作。它给俞平伯先生的研究奠定了基础。其后，他所写的文章，大都以此为根据。它的基本论点一直贯串到“红楼梦研究”和“红楼梦简论”，指导着俞平伯先生研究红楼梦的全部过程。因此，全面地从“红楼梦辨”开始分析和批判俞平伯先生的研究工作，严肃地评价他在思想战线上的作用，是完全必要的。
    一九二二年前后，由于中国的政治形势起了剧烈的变化，由于马克思主义在中国得到了更广泛而深入的传播，“五四”时期反帝反封建的新文化运动的统一战线开始分裂了。共产主义知识分子和资产阶级知识分子分道扬镳了。小资产阶级知识分子也向着两个方向分化着。正如鲁迅先生所说：“有的高升，有的退隐，有的前进，我又经验了一回同一战阵中的伙伴还是会这么变化”〔二〕。资产阶级知识分子为了维护自己阶级的狭隘利益，就放弃了反封建的文化斗争，调转矛头，直接对付马克思主义，企图阻止马克思主义在中国的传播和运用。
    代表买办资产阶级的知识分子胡适之，为了抵抗马克思主义的宣传，在政治上提出了“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”的口号〔三〕，在学术上提出了反动的实验主义的“考据学”。胡适之提倡“考据学”的目的非常清楚。他说：
        “少年的朋友们，莫把这些小说考证看作
    我教你们读小说的文字。这些都只是思想问题
    的方法的一些例子。在这些文字里，我要读者
    学得一点科学精神，一点科学态度，一点科学
    方法。科学态度在于寻求事实，寻求真理。科
    学态度在于撇开成见，搁起感情，只认得事
    实，只跟着证据走。科学方法只是‘大胆的假
    设，小心的求证’十个字。没有证据，只可悬
    而不断；证据不够，只可假设，不可武断；必
    须等到证实之后，方可奉为定论。……
        我这里千言万语，也只要教人一个不受人
    惑的方法。被孔丘朱熹牵着鼻子走，固然不算
    高明；被马克思列宁斯大林牵着鼻子走，也算
    不得好汉。我自己决不想牵着谁的鼻子走。我只
    希望尽我微薄的能力，教我的少年朋友们学一
    点防身的本领，努力作一个不受人惑的人。”
      （胡适文选自序）
    除开胡适之的历史“著作”不谈，在文学研究方面，他就是以“红楼梦考证”等形式主义的“考据”文章实践了这一主张的。
    胡适之所提倡的学术路线，其反动的目的就是阻挠马克思主义在青年中的传播，把他们蒙着眼睛牵着鼻子走向“国故”堆里去，脱离现实，避开当时尖锐的阶级斗争。
    在文学研究上，俞平伯先生的“红楼梦辨”就正是这条路线的忠实的追随者和实践者。据俞平伯先生自己说，在胡适之提出这些口号之前，他对红楼梦“还没有系统的研究的兴味”，等到胡适之的
  “红楼梦考证”发表之后，“于是研究底意兴方才感染到我”。这时俞平伯先生才正式开始系统地研究红楼梦。胡适之和俞平伯曾以通信的形式讨论红楼梦，彼此一唱一和，使他们“一向希望的乐趣，到这时居然实现”。这自然是喜不自胜的事，因为“红楼梦辨”完全实践了他们的主张。
    但是，要引导人们脱离现实，避开社会的阶级斗争，首先就必须否认文学是人类认识生活、反映生活的艺术手段。因为，说明现实主义文学，正是通过把社会生活现象的本质典型化的方法，揭示社会发展的规律性，教育和改造人的灵魂，从而促进社会的改造，这就是现实主义文学的真正使命，也是文学研究、文学批评所要阐明的中心问题。“新红学派”为了达到他们的目的，首先否认红楼梦是一部现实主义作品。胡适之的“红楼梦考证”的中心目的就在于用考证来证明红楼梦是一部记录事实的作品，它的价值也就在于这“平淡无奇”的事实记录上。
    俞平伯先生也正是沿着这条道路前进的。“红楼梦辨”曾分别考证书中诸情节的事实真相，认为贾姓即曹姓，以曹雪芹的家世证贾宝玉，以贾宝玉的形象证曹雪芹的身世，并将书中个别的字句或情节拼凑起来，去断定一个人的结局。俞平伯先生把研究和分析艺术形象的工作变成了“剔骨拔刺”，以琐细的考证凌迟了人物形象。这样就和胡适之的结论完全达到一致，即红楼梦是一部自然主义作品，因而否定了红楼梦的现实主义的社会内容。
    但是，实验主义的“考据学”是无法掩盖它的唯心论的尾巴的。“红楼梦辨”在从多方面论证红楼梦是事实的记录时，常常陷于自相矛盾，时而说它是“自传”，时而又说它是“演色空”观念。既是事实，又如何演？既是“演色空”观念，而事实又在那里呢？这就是实验主义“考据学”无法消除的自我矛盾的悲哀。
    文学认识和反映现实并不是目的本身，而是在于唤醒人们去改造现实。“红楼梦辨”在否定红楼梦社会内容的同时，也就否定了它的社会作用；亦即它反封建的倾向性。“红楼梦辨”在“高本与戚本的大体比较”一章中说：“依高本看，红楼梦是文学，是唤醒痴迷，陶写性灵的；依戚本看，红楼梦是闲书，是争妍取媚，喷酒下饭的。”这两个判断把红楼梦的思想性完全抹杀了，无论就那一个判断看来，红楼梦都失去了它真实的价值，变成表现抽象“人性”的东西。于是，从“自传的观念”论者的观点看来，红楼梦是没有意义的作品。请听俞平伯先生怎样说：“平心看来，红楼梦在世界文学中底位置是不很高的。这一类小说，和一切中国的文学——诗，词，曲，——在一个平面上。这类文学底特色，至多不过是个人身世性格的反映。红楼梦底态度虽有上说的三层，但总不过是身世之感，牢骚之语。即后来的忏悔了悟，以我从楔子里推想，亦并不能脱去东方思想底窠臼；不过因为旧欢难舍，身世飘零，悔恨无从，付诸一哭，于是发而为文章，以自怨自解。其用亦不过破闷醒目，避世消愁而已。故红楼梦性质亦与中国的闲书性质相似，不得入于近代文学之林。”（红楼梦辨中卷二一—二二
    页）俞平伯先生在“红楼梦研究”一书中虽将这段话删去，但他企图贬低红楼梦的倾向仍然存在着。
    这样就给红楼梦注射了消毒剂，清除了它的“危险”作用，这对于封建阶级是大大的有利。在这里，俞平伯先生所以把红楼梦看成是曹雪芹“自传”的目的就完全暴露出来了。不仅这样，在俞平伯先生素来的认识中，全部中国古典文学都是毫无可取的，上引的一段话中说的还较缓和，而在“红楼梦辨”的其他地方却是十分的露骨了，“凡中国的小说，都是俳优文学，所以只知道讨顾客的喜欢”，“曹雪芹所指野史大约就是金瓶梅”。同时他也不满于水浒的“奖盗贼贬军官”，并讽刺嘲笑儒林外史对“村老儿唱戏的，却一唱三叹而不止”。这很明显地是反对那些作品对人民的歌颂和热爱。对祖国优秀的文化遗产持虚无主义的否定态度，这正是“五四”以后洋场绅士的本色。从这种反动的虚无主义的否定论出发，必然会引导到丧失民族自信心。
    从以上的分析中不难看出，胡适之派的“新红学家”们所标榜的“这种文学，看似专家的考证，其实很可给一班人以历史观念”的“历史观念”，究竟是一种什么样的货色了。有人说俞平伯先生不是以观点著名，而是以考证方法著名。那么，就再看看他的考证方法的实质是什么。
    “红楼梦辨”是专重事实的考证而避开内容不谈，这正是胡适之所标榜的方法。胡适之在他的“红楼梦考证”中说：
        “我觉得我们做红楼梦的考证，只能在这
    两个问题上着手；只能运用我们力所能搜集的
    材料，参考互证，然后抽出一些比较的最近情理
    的结论。这是考证学的方法。……处处想撇开一
    切先入的成见；处处存一个搜求证据的目的，
    处处尊重证据，让证据作向导，引我到相当的结
    论上去。……但我自信：这种考证的方法，
    ……是向来研究红楼梦的人不曾用过的。我希
    望我这一点小贡献，能引起大家研究红楼梦的
    兴趣，能把将来的红楼梦研究引上正当的轨道去：打破从前种种穿凿附会的‘红学’，创造科学方法的红楼梦研究！”（中国章回小说考
    证，二三二—二三三页）
    我们认为考证作者的家世、生平是完全必要的，但必须是在为了分析作品内容的前提下才有意义。可是，胡适之和他的忠实的追随者俞平伯先生因为“考证”，却把红楼梦丰富的社会内容抹煞了，使完整的艺术形象割裂了，剩下的只是几条能满足俞平伯先生“研究兴味”的事实根据。
    究竟“红楼梦辨”是怎样进行考证工作的呢？
    俞平伯先生说：“我们有一个最主要的观念，红楼梦是作者底自传”，“既晓得是自传，当然书中的人物事情都是实有而非虚构”。从这一“最主要的观念”出发，去寻找事实的根据来证实它，这是一条最轻便的道路。从表面看这“最主要的观念”不是凭空而来，而是从作者自叙中的某些话里得来。但红楼梦是一部文学作品，它有某些事实作蓝本是不足为奇的，然而它绝不是事实的记录。如果相信作者自叙的话全是事实，也应该相信贾宝玉是那块大石头的化身，相信真有太虚幻境。如此，恐怕俞平伯先生的考证也要大费周折了。
    俞平伯先生的“最主要的观念”是片面的主观主义的假设，其实用的目的就在于从作品中抽出对他有“兴味”的事实，来证实它的假设，使客观的作品中的艺术形象服从于他的主观主义的考据。在文学研究的考据工作中，这是彻头彻尾的实验主义方法。胡适之所提倡的“大胆的假设，小心的求证”的“考据”方法，在“红楼梦辨”或“红楼梦研究”中都得到了充分的体现。所谓“大胆的假设”就是不顾一切客观事物的真象，制造出主观的观念；所谓“小心的求证”就是使所有客观的事物都能符合这种主观的论断。使客观服从主观就是实验主义主观唯心论的认识论和方法论的统一。俞平伯先生考证红楼梦的方法论的源泉，就是从此而来。
    “红楼梦辨”虽然在表面上避开了红楼梦的内容不谈，实际上却狠狠地批评和歪曲了红楼梦的内容，从每一个考证的结论中都可看出他对红楼梦的曲解。俞平伯先生只不过是以考证的方法代替了文学批评的原则而已，这是和他的实验主义观点密切相关的。因此，在他的批评中就表现出强烈的主观主义色彩。（关于这一点，我们在评“红楼梦研究”一文中已有论述，此处从略。）
    由此可见，俞平伯先生的方法论的基础正是实验主义的主观唯心论。那些形而上学地企图把方法和观点对立起来的人，在这里却大上其当了。
    顾颉刚先生为“红楼梦辨”所作的序言中把俞平伯先生和胡适之标榜为“新红学派”，并“希望大家看着这旧红学的打倒，新红学的成立”。那么，这“新红学”的实质究竟是什么呢？总结起来，不过三点。
    第一，“新红学”的研究态度表面是新的，而骨子里仍然是旧的。俞平伯先生在一九二一年说：
  “京事一切沉闷，（新华门军警打伤教职员，）更无可道者；不如剧谈红楼为消夏神方，因每一执笔必奕奕如有神助也。”（“红楼梦辨”顾序）避开当时的政治斗争，钻到红楼梦中去消遣，逃避现实的士大夫阶级的怯懦本色完全暴露出来了。这却是真正继承了旧红学家最坏的传统。
    第二，“新红学家”自称是把“研究的方法改过来了”；“从前的人不注重于实际的材料，而注重于猜度力的敏锐，所以他们喜欢用冥想去求解释”，而“‘新红学’家”是“处处把实际的材料做前导”，“用新方法去驾驭实际的材料”来解释主观的冥想。所谓“新”方法就是在新的反动的实验主义哲学指导下钻牛角尖的方法，这的确是旧红学家所没有的。归根结底，他们是使红楼梦符合于他们的实验主义的考证，这正是他们引以自豪的“正确”的科学方法，也是最有“效用”的方法。
      第三，“新红学家”曾想办一个研究红楼梦的
  月刊，号召“人结了伴侣，就我们走到的地方再走
  过去”，引导读者逃避现实的政治斗争，免受马克
  思主义的“危险”影响，都很安全地到红楼梦中去
  “消夏”，“辨得越凶”，离现实越远越好。用这
  些东西来影响读者，使他们“无形之中，养成了他
  们的历史观念和科学方法”，都变成实验主义的信
  徒。
    总之，“新红学”的实质就在于它是士大夫阶级意识和买办思想的混血儿，是反动的实验主义在古典文学研究领域中的具体表现。几十年来成绩虽不多，而影响却不小，它支配着对红楼梦的研究，过去是这样，今天在一定程度上也还是这样。
    但在解放以后，在新的政治条件下，俞平伯先生非但没有对过去的研究工作和他的影响作深刻的检讨，相反的却把旧作改头换面地重新发表出来，这就是一九五二年出版的“红楼梦研究”。“红楼梦研究”删去了旧著中个别的篇幅、细节和著作年月，并和补充的部分新作排在一起，在新的时代发表。因此，我们完全有理由认为它是新作。新作除了提供了一些新的考证材料并将个别的字句和表面结论稍加修正之外，而骨子里的立场、观点和方法都毫无改变地保留下来。俞平伯先生以隐蔽的方式，向学术界和广大的青年读者公开地贩卖胡适之的实验主义，使它在中国学术界中间借尸还魂。
    但是，这现象不但没有遭到反对，反而有人对俞平伯先生的考证工作备加赞扬，这种“抑扬的话头”不但掩饰了俞平伯先生的一切错误，而且帮助他的有毒的思想得以顺利地向青年中传播。从这里，我们也更可以看到，俞平伯先生所继承了的胡适之的反动思想的流毒，在过渡时期复杂的阶级斗争的环境里，是怎样在挣扎着的。我们不应该过低估计它对广大读者的危害性，它现在会将来也会披着各种各样的外衣出现的。我们要研究红楼梦，首先就应该批评俞平伯先生的这种错误的观点和方法；要研究全部古典文学遗产就必须批判与此相同的观点和方法——即实验主义的反动哲学通过胡适之过去在中国学术界所长期散布的流毒。只有这样，才能真正使我们的古典文学研究工作走向正确的健康的道路，才能真正把马克思主义的光辉旗帜在古典文学研究工作的领域中树立起来，照耀着我们前进的道路。
