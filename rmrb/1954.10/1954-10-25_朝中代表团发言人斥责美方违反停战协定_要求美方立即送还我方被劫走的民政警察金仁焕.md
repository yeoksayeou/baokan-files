Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 24th: Chief Commissioner Li Sang-cho, Lieutenant General of the Korean Military Armistice Commission of the DPRK-China side, requested the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to dispatch a mobile neutral nations inspection team on the 21st regarding the incidents of the U.S. side continuously sending armed personnel to conduct hostile acts against the DPRK-China side. On the 23rd, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission replied to the DPRK-China side, claiming that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission could not execute the DPRK-China side's request due to the opposition of the Swiss and Swedish commissioners. In response, the Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed the spokesperson of the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who gave the following statement:

The spokesperson said: Recently, incidents of armed forces under the control of the U.S. side sending armed personnel to conduct hostile acts against the DPRK-China side have occurred continuously and have become increasingly serious. On October 11th, the U.S.-backed Syngman Rhee puppet army again dispatched armed forces to intrude into the demilitarized zone of the DPRK-China side, killing Li Zhi-san, a civil police officer of the DPRK-China side near Dousu-dong, and wounding and kidnapping Kim In-hwan, a civil police officer of the DPRK-China side. After this incident, U.S. armed forces were discovered carrying heavy weapons and illegally entering the U.S.-controlled demilitarized zone near the location of the aforementioned incident.

The spokesperson pointed out: Not long before this incident, two similar incidents had already occurred on August 17th and August 30th. The U.S. side's continuous dispatch of armed personnel to conduct hostile activities against the DPRK-China side seriously violates the armistice agreement.

Regarding the serious violation of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side on October 11th, the Joint Observer Team of the Military Armistice Commission conducted a joint investigation at the request of the DPRK-China side. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 21st, the DPRK-China side lodged a serious protest with the U.S. side regarding this incident, demanding that the U.S. side immediately return Kim In-hwan, the civil police officer of the DPRK-China side who was kidnapped by the U.S. side. However, the U.S. side disregarded the facts and continued to deny the incident with the same old clichés, and refused to return Kim In-hwan from the military control area of the other side. Therefore, the DPRK-China side suggested that Military Armistice Commission jointly request the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to send a mobile neutral nations inspection team to conduct special inspections in the military control area of the other side. However, Britton, the chief commissioner of the U.S. side, wantonly slandered the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, especially defaming the Czechoslovak and Polish representatives of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, claiming that "there is no reason to believe that a fair investigation can be conducted at any time or place," and unreasonably rejected the legitimate suggestion of the DPRK-China side.

The spokesperson pointed out: The U.S. side's slander of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is not based on any facts. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has dispatched mobile teams in the past to conduct fair inspections, and has played and is playing an active role in supervising the Korean armistice. The U.S. side's unfounded slander of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is clearly malicious.

Since the U.S. side refused to jointly submit a request by the Military Armistice Commission, Chief Commissioner Li Sang-cho of the DPRK-China side sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on October 21st, unilaterally requesting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to dispatch a mobile neutral nations inspection team to investigate the aforementioned incidents at locations outside the demilitarized zone. According to the explicit provisions of Article 28 of the Armistice Agreement: "The Military Armistice Commission or any Chief Commissioner on either side shall be entitled to request the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to conduct special observation and inspection at locations outside the demilitarized zone where violations of this Armistice Agreement have been reported," the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has a responsibility to dispatch a mobile team to inspect this series of violations of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side; however, due to the opposition of the Swiss and Swedish commissioners, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission failed to execute this request. The spokesperson pointed out that the DPRK-China side cannot but express regret over this.

The spokesperson finally pointed out: The U.S. side must bear serious responsibility for the serious violation of the armistice agreement in continuously dispatching armed personnel to conduct hostile acts. The U.S. side must immediately return Kim In-hwan, the civil police officer of the DPRK-China side.

    朝中代表团发言人斥责美方违反停战协定
    要求美方立即送还我方被劫走的民政警察金仁焕
    【新华社开城二十四日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将，曾在二十一日就美方连续派遣武装人员向朝中方面进行敌对行为的事件，请求中立国监察委员会派机动中立国视察小组进行调查。二十三日，中立国监察委员会函复朝中方面，声称由于瑞士委员和瑞典委员的反对，中立国监察委员会未能执行朝中方面的请求。对此，新华通讯社记者特走访朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团发言人，承发言人发表谈话如下：
    发言人说：最近一个时期来，美方控制下的武装部队派遣武装人员向朝中方面进行敌对行为的事件连续发生，而且日益严重。十月十一日美方李承晚伪军又派遣了武装部队侵入朝中方面非军事区，在豆粟洞附近杀害了朝中方面民政警察李治三，并打伤和劫走了朝中方面民政警察金仁焕；这一事件发生后，并曾发现美方武装部队携带重武器非法进入了上述事件发生地点附近的美方控制下的非军事区。
    发言人指出：在发生这次事件的不久以前，在八月十七日和八月三十日就已发生过两次此类事件，美方这种连续不断地派遣武装人员向朝中方面进行敌对活动的行为，严重地违反了停战协定。
    对十月十一日美方严重违反停战协定的事件，在朝中方面的要求下，军事停战委员会联合观察小组曾进行了共同调查。在十月二十一日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面曾就此事件向美方提出严重抗议，要求美方立即交还被美方劫走的朝中方面民政警察金仁焕；然而美方不顾事实仍以千篇一律的滥调进行抵赖，并拒绝从对方军事控制地区，送还金仁焕；因此朝中方面建议军事停战委员会向中立国监察委员会共同要求派出机动中立国视察小组，到对方军事控制地区进行特别视察，但是美方首席委员布里敦竟肆意诬蔑中立国监察委员会，特别是诽谤中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克代表和波兰代表，硬说：“没有任何理由能相信在任何时间或地点可以进行公正的调查”。而无理拒绝了朝中方面的正当建议。
      发言人指出：美方对于中立国监察委员会的诬蔑是没有任何事实根据的，中立国监察委员会过去曾经派遣机动小组进行过公正的视察，在监督朝鲜停战的工作中起了并正在起着积极的作用，美方对中立国监察委员会进行这种毫无事实根据的诬蔑，显然是别有用心的。
      由于美方拒绝由军事停战委员会共同提出请求，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将乃于十月二十一日致函中立国监察委员会，单方面请求中立国监察委员会派遣机动中立国视察小组到非军事区以外的地点，对上述事件进行调查。根据停战协定第二十八款的明文规定：“军事停战委员会或其中任何一方首席委员有权请求中立国监察委员会至非军事区以外据报发生违反本停战协定事件的地点进行特别观察与视察”，中立国监察委员会负有责任派遣机动小组去对美方这一连串的违反停战协定的事件进行视察；但是由于瑞士委员和瑞典委员的反对，中立国监察委员会未能执行这一要求。发言人指出，朝中方面不能不对此表示遗憾。
    发言人最后指出：对于连续派遣武装人员进行敌对行为的严重违反停战协定的事件，美方必须担负严重责任，美方必须立即交还朝中方面民政警察金仁焕。
