    The Soviet Party and Government's Concern for the Working People
    ——Introducing the Daily Necessities Industry at the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction

    Clothing and Apparel
    In the Central Industry Pavilion of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, on the second floor in front of the dazzling display of silks and fabrics, we met Comrade Gushev, a Soviet textile expert. He led us to view more than nine hundred different colors, grades, and uses of silk, wool, and cotton and linen fabrics.
    Various silks and cloths have beautiful patterns and national characteristics. Comrade Gushev said: All our patterns come from the people. People of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, whether in cities or villages, can choose their favorite patterns to make clothes. From the Daily Necessities Industry Department to the textile factories, the Soviet Union has specialized institutions for pattern design and evaluation. The Soviet Cotton Textile Scientific Research Institute also has a specialized department for designing new varieties. They all regard increasing variety and meeting the needs of the people as the main tasks in production. All textile factories have pattern design studios, and the main task of the designers is to collect materials and create new patterns. Therefore, the same material can be printed with dozens of different colors and patterns.
    To the west of the fabric exhibits, against the backdrop of the scenery of the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter, more than one hundred different styles of clothing are displayed separately. In two glass cabinets, one hundred pairs of fashionable leather shoes and silk stockings are displayed. After visiting the various beautiful national costumes, people will recall the scenes in the movies of Uzbeks or Ukrainians singing and dancing in festive costumes. Here, people can also see the wedding clothes of a pair of Kyrgyz young men and women: the men's formal dress is made of black velvet, inlaid with white lace; the women's formal dress is a white silk gown, with a crimson velvet vest inlaid with gold lace. There are also festive and casual clothes of Kazakh, Armenian and Lithuanian nationalities. As everyone knows, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan had no industry before the revolution, but now a powerful textile industry has emerged, constantly producing colorful fabrics.
    Here, people can see spring clothes made of various silks, knitwear and thin wool, summer gowns made of processed embroidered gauze and silk, autumn coats made of darker wool and woolen fabrics with fur collars and cuffs, and various precious furs: squirrel skin, silver fox, mink, sable, curly lambskin, and coats and shawls made of the above-mentioned furs.
    From the above-mentioned various fashionable and high-quality clothing, we can see the high living standards of the Soviet people, and we can also see the artistic talents of clothing design experts and art workers.
    The description on the clothing exhibition section reads: The prices of Soviet food and industrial products have been reduced seven times from 1947 to 1954, so the overall price level has been reduced by more than half. The Soviet people have gained more income from the continuous reduction of prices.
    The Soviet Union is now vigorously developing the daily necessities industry and continuously improving quality. This year, the Soviet Union will build and renovate 1,200 industrial enterprises that manufacture daily necessities.
      Achievements in Health and Sports
    On the second floor of the Central Industry Pavilion, eastern side, various sports equipment and medical supplies are displayed: more than two hundred and forty kinds of medical equipment, seventy-three kinds of medicines, and one hundred pieces of sports equipment. Here is a universal operating table, which can be raised, lowered and rotated freely; the patient can lie on it for various operations. The operating table is equipped with a gas anesthetic inhaler. The doctor only needs to press a button, and the patient can inhale the anesthetic without any pain. Above the operating table is a shadowless lamp, which is reflected by eight sun lamps from various angles; its light is very strong, can be used for deep cavity irradiation, will not produce shadows, and will not make patients and doctors feel hot, so as not to affect their health and work. Now, general hospitals in the Soviet Union have this equipment.
    Childbirth is often considered a painful thing for women, but in the scientifically developed Soviet Union, the situation has changed. Here is a painless delivery device that can be used to help mothers produce safely.
    There is also a set of "Filatov's Corneal Transplant Device." It can take the cornea from a person whose heart has just stopped beating and transplant it to the eyes of a living person, so that the blind can see the light again. Soviet experts said: This great invention enjoys the highest evaluation in the Soviet Union. This is good news for the blind, and it will bring them light.
    There are also various surgical instrument sterilizers and snow moving sterilizers. In a large glass square cabinet, various Soviet-made surgical instruments are displayed, including various shiny and sharp surgical scissors and cutting knives, various hemostatic forceps and tweezers, gastric fissure compressors, prism universal rib forceps, blunt forceps for supporting wounds and three-petal wound retractors, complex endotracheal anesthesia devices, etc. These extremely exquisite and convenient surgical instruments have particularly attracted the attention of our country's surgeons.
    The increasingly developed health care cause in the Soviet Union guarantees the healthy life of the Soviet people. Statistical charts clearly show that from 1940 to 1955, the number of doctors in the Soviet Union has increased by 119%. The number of urban and rural hospital beds has also increased by 50%. Preventive health care has developed more universally and extensively in the Soviet Union. In scenic spots such as the Black Sea coast, the Soviet government has established comfortable sanatoriums for workers. As of this year, the Soviet Union has established a huge vacation and sanatorium network, including more than 350 vacation destinations and more than 2,500 sanatoriums. From 1940 to 1955, the state budget expenditure for health and sports increased by 293 times. The number of deaths in the Soviet population has been greatly reduced. In the past three years, the net increase in the Soviet population has reached 9.5 million.
    The Soviet Party and government not only attach importance to health care, but also pay attention to the development of sports, and regard it as an effective method to enhance physical fitness and a positive factor in striving for people's longevity. People can see from the sports equipment such as basketballs, sleds, skates, shotguns, bicycles, etc. displayed on the exhibition stand and various pictures that the interests of the Soviet people are multifaceted; sports have become a widespread mass movement in the Soviet Union. The outstanding achievements of Soviet sports show this. At the 15th Olympic Games, Soviet athletes won 38 gold medals, 56 silver medals and 18 bronze medals, creating two world records and twelve Soviet records.
      Emphasis on Children's Happiness
    In the last corner of the east corridor on the second floor, more than one hundred kinds of children's toys and appliances are displayed. Here are beautiful rubber dolls, rabbits, piglets, cockerels, camels, etc. for babies around one year old to play with, automatic small trains and small sewing machines for children aged five or six to play with, extremely comfortable small carts for young infants to use, and tricycles and four-wheeled carts for general children to play with.
    The Soviet Party and government especially care about women and children. Here people can see various popular publications on maternal and child health compiled and printed by the Health Education Institute of the Soviet Ministry of Health, as well as propaganda albums such as "Infant Diet," "Infant Care and Education," "Prevention of Diarrhea in Children," and "Mother Protection in the Soviet Union."
    Soviet experts said: In order to develop children's intelligence and physical strength, the Soviet Union has many factories that manufacture various toys for children. For example, the Leningrad Triangle Rubber Factory has a workshop specializing in the production of various rubber toys. Some timber factories have special workshops for manufacturing various wooden toys. Some steel factories have small toy factories attached to them. Each Soviet republic has a large-scale children's department store. The largest children's department store in Europe in the central district of Moscow is under construction, and it will be able to receive 200,000 customers every day in the future.
    Soviet experts said: In the Soviet Union, there are many youth palaces in cities and villages, where children can choose the subjects they particularly love to study in their spare time. There are now more than 1,200 Young Pioneer Palaces, spread across Soviet cities and villages. The famous Leningrad Zhdanov Young Pioneer Palace is very large. It has six departments: the Mass Political Work Department, the Science Department, the Technology Department, the Art Education Department, the Sports Department, and the Youth Work Methods Department. There are more than 180 teachers in the palace who specialize in tutoring children; famous writers, artists and scientists also often come here to meet the children.

    苏联党和政府对劳动人民的关怀
    ——介绍苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上的日用品工业

    衣料和服装
    在苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中央工业馆二楼陈列着五光十色的绸缎布匹的展品台前，我们会见了苏联纺织专家古雪耶夫同志。他带领我们观看了九百多幅不同样色、不同品级和不同用途的绸缎、毛呢和棉、麻织成的布料。
    各种各样的绸布上都有美丽的图案和富有民族色彩的花纹。古雪耶夫同志说：我们的一切花样都是从民间来的。苏联各族人民，不论在城市和农村中，都可以挑选自己最喜爱的花样来做衣服。苏联从日用品工业部到纺织工厂，都有花纹设计和花样评选的专门机构。苏联棉纺织科学研究院也有专门设计新品种的部门。它们都把增加品种、满足人民需要当作生产上的主要任务。所有纺织工厂都有花纹图案设计室，设计人员的主要任务在于搜集资料，创造新图案。因此，同一种料子有可能印出几十种不同颜色和花纹的图案。
    在布匹展品的西边，以春夏秋冬四季大自然的景色为背景，分别陈列着一百多种不同样式的服装。在两个玻璃柜里，陈列着一百双时式皮鞋和丝袜子。人们在参观了各种漂亮民族服装以后，就会联想起在电影中看到的乌兹别克人或乌克兰人穿着盛装载歌载舞时的情景。在这里，人们还可以看到一对吉尔吉斯青年男女的结婚服：男礼服用黑色丝绒制成，镶有白花边；女礼服是白绸长衫，套着镶有金花边的紫红丝绒背心。这里也有哈萨克、亚美尼亚和立陶宛等民族的节日服装和便服。大家都知道，乌兹别克、塔吉克在革命前是没有工业的，现在已出现了强大的纺织工业，不断生产着彩色布匹。
    在这里，人们可以看到各种丝织品、针织品和薄呢做成的春装，加工刺绣的纱、绸制的夏季长衫，用较深色毛、呢料子缝制的并在领口、袖口镶有皮毛的秋季大衣，以及各种贵重的皮毛：灰鼠皮、银狐、水貉皮、黑貂皮、卷毛羊皮，和由上述皮料做成的大衣、披肩。
    从上述各种色样新颖、质量精良的服装，可以看出苏联人民高度的生活水平，也可以看到服装设计专家和美术工作者们的艺术才能。
    在服装展出部分的说明牌上写着：苏联粮食产品和工业产品价格自一九四七年至一九五四年降低了七次，因此整个物价水平降低了一半多。苏联人民从物价不断降低中获得了更多的收入。
    苏联现在还在大力发展日用品工业，并不断改进质量。今年苏联将新建和改建一千二百个制造日用品的工业企业。
      保健和体育的成就
    在中央工业馆二楼东部，陈列着各种体育运动器具和医疗用品：二百四十多种医疗器材，七十三种药剂，一百件运动器具。这里有一台万能手术台，它可以自由地升降、旋转；病人躺在上面，可以进行各种各样的手术。手术台附有一个气体麻醉剂吸入器，医生只要一按电钮，病人就可以毫无痛苦地吸入麻醉剂。手术台的上边吊着一台无影灯，它是由八个太阳灯管从各种不同角度反射的；它的光力很强，能进行深腔照射，不会产生黑影，也不会使病人和医生感到灼热以致影响身体和工作。现在，苏联一般的大医院都有这种设备。
    妇女生孩子往往被认为是一件很痛苦的事，但在科学发达的苏联，情况已有改变。这里陈列着一台无痛分娩器，它可以利用帮助产妇安全生产。
    这里还有一套“费拉托夫式角膜移植器”。它可以把心脏刚刚停止跳动的人的角膜取下来，移植到活人的眼睛上，使失明者重见光明。苏联专家说：这个伟大的发明在苏联享有最高的评价。这是失明者的福音，它将给他们带来光明。
    这里还有各种手术器械消毒器、雪动消毒器。在一个大玻璃方柜里，陈列着苏联制造的各种手术器械，有各种雪亮锋利的手术用的直剪刀和截断刀，有各式止血铗和镊子，胃裂压榨器，棱片万能肋骨钳，撑伤口用钝钳和三片瓣状扩创器，复杂的气管内用麻醉器等等，这些极其精致的灵便的手术器械，特别引起我国外科医生的注意。
    苏联日益发展的保健事业保障着苏联人民的健康生活。统计图表清楚地说明：从一九四○年到一九五五年，苏联的医生人数已增加了百分之一百一十九。城乡病床数也已增长了百分之五十。预防保健事业在苏联发展得更为普遍、广泛。在黑海滨等风景优美的地方，苏联政府为劳动者建立了舒适的疗养院。到今年为止，苏联已建立了巨大的休养疗养网，包括三百五十多处休养地，二千五百多所疗养院。从一九四○年到一九五五年，国家预算用于保健和体育事业的支出增长了二百九十三倍。苏联人口死亡数大大减少了，最近三年来，苏联人口净增数达九百五十万。
    苏联党和政府不仅重视保健事业，而且注意发展体育运动，把它作为增强体质的有效方法和争取人民长寿的积极因素。人们从展览台上陈列的篮球、雪橇、冰鞋、猎枪、自行车等运动器具以及各种图片看出，苏联人民的兴趣是多方面的；体育运动在苏联已成为广泛的群众性的运动。苏联体育运动成绩的卓越显示了这一点。在十五届奥林匹克运动会上，苏联运动员们获得了三十八枚金奖章、五十六枚银奖章和十八枚铜奖章，创造了两项世界纪录和十二项苏联纪录。
      对儿童幸福的重视
    在二楼东走廊的最后一角，陈列着一百多种儿童玩具和用具。这里有用橡胶做成的供一岁左右婴孩玩的美丽的洋娃娃、小兔子、小猪、小公鸡、小骆驼等，有供五六岁小孩玩的自动的小火车、小缝纫机，有供幼婴用的极其舒适的小车，有供一般孩子玩的三轮、四轮小车。
    苏联党和政府特别关怀妇女儿童。在这里人们可以看到苏联保健部卫生教育研究所编印的各种有关妇婴卫生的通俗读物，以及“婴儿饮食”、“婴儿照顾及其教育”、“预防儿童泻肚病”、“苏联的母亲保护”等宣传画册。
    苏联专家说：为了发展孩子的智力和体力，苏联有很多工厂为孩子们制造各种玩具。例如，列宁格勒三角橡胶工厂就有一个车间，专门制作各种橡胶玩具。有些木材工厂专门设立制造各种木器玩具的车间。某些钢铁工厂里附设有小玩具工厂。苏联各加盟共和国都设有规模很大的儿童百货公司。莫斯科中心区一座欧洲最大的儿童百货公司正在建筑中，将来它每天可以接待二十万顾客。
    苏联专家说：在苏联，城市和农村中有许多少年宫，儿童可在业余时间到这里选择自己特别爱好的学习科目。现在已有一千二百多个少年先锋宫，遍布于苏联的城市和农村。著名的列宁格勒日丹诺夫少年先锋宫的规模很大，它设有六个部：群众政治工作部、科学部、技术部、艺术教育部、体育部和少年工作方法部。宫内有一百八十多个教员，专门对孩子们进行辅导工作；著名的作家、艺术家和科学家，也经常到这里和孩子们见面。
