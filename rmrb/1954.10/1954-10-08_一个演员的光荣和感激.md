Title: A Performer's Glory and Gratitude

An actor's life in the old society was one of extreme suffering. From the moment you started learning to perform as a child, you were constantly beaten and scolded, never had enough to eat, and never had enough to wear. And once you grew up and knew how to sing, the oppression and humiliation from warlords and bureaucrats would come pouring in! I remember sixteen years ago, when I was only thirteen or fourteen, just an innocent child, my father took me to perform at the Yong'an Theater in Xiangguo Temple, Kaifeng. I was quite popular with the masses at the time, and business was good. However, because I didn't understand the rules of the rulers on the ground and didn't give gifts to the secret agents to buy them off, they threatened to drive me out of Kaifeng. Because the masses welcomed me, I refused to leave. Later, when they couldn't do anything about it, they threw a grenade backstage while I was putting on makeup, missing me by only a yard, but unfortunately killing a comrade who was doing makeup. After this incident, the reactionary government not only didn't arrest the criminals but instead arrested my father and four actors and imprisoned them. The performance was stopped, and everyone's food money was gone, so we had no choice but to leave Kaifeng and go perform elsewhere. First we went to Weishi County. Who knew Weishi County would be even worse? A Nationalist bandit army commander named Huang was the local emperor there. First, he watched the performances every day without buying tickets, and even if he didn't go, he had to have ten seats reserved. Later, he came up with an even worse idea and openly tried to force me to become his concubine. I was furious and, risking my life, gave him a good scolding. The reactionaries were out to exterminate us. First, they dragged away and shot a landlord surnamed Wang who sympathized with me. At night, they threw two grenades into our theater and said, "You're blind. You got grenades in Kaifeng, and now you'll get a taste of grenades again in Weishi." In this treacherous environment, I had to disguise myself as an old woman and flee overnight. With tears of grief and pain in my eyes, I was forced to leave my beloved hometown and decided to flee to Shaanxi to survive. After arriving in Mi County, I ran out of money, and there were fewer acquaintances, so I often ate chaff and tree bark. When we arrived in Xi'an, many of our actors became homeless beggars with nowhere to go. An actor named Xiao Cang contracted dysentery and didn't have money for treatment. Before he even breathed his last, the reactionary police station said he was obstructing hygiene and forced people to bury this still-living person. Just before he was buried, Xiao Cang begged, "I'm not dead yet!"

It wasn't easy to escape to Xi'an, thinking things would be better, but who knew that everything was the same everywhere in the old society? We ran into the three famous scourges of the theater world at the time: the Nationalist "Youth Army," the "Officer Corps," and the "Honorary Army." They were smashing theaters and causing trouble almost every day, making people tremble with fear. I didn't even dare to leave the house during the day!

In 1948, we went to Lanzhou to perform. One autumn afternoon, it was pouring rain, and I was sick. The Ma bandit Hong Kui sent someone to call me to sing for him. I refused to go. Not long after, several "armed" men came and said, "The chief asked you to go, he thinks highly of you. Don't be ungrateful. You have to go whether you want to or not!" I was dragged there, and they were gambling and drinking, and I stood by and sang for their amusement. As I sang, my heart felt like it was being stabbed. Therefore, whenever I read Article 95 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which states, "The People's Republic of China guarantees citizens the freedom to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities. The state encourages and assists the creative work of citizens engaged in science, education, literature, art, and other cultural undertakings," I strongly contrasted it with the experiences of actors in the old society: the ruthless grenades were the reactionary rulers' assistance to artists; the gloomy prisons were their encouragement to artists; the frequent smashing of theaters was their "care" for artists at any time and anywhere!

After liberation, everything changed. The theaters were peaceful every day. The People's Liberation Army not only bought tickets to watch performances but also voluntarily helped us maintain order. The government's theater work cadres also frequently helped us rehearse new plays, learn culture, and discuss current events. I had two aspirations early on: one was to organize a sound troupe to improve Henan Opera; the other was to recruit a group of students to train the next generation. However, in the old society, I yearned for many years and was disappointed for many years. The troupe only had a dozen people, ten or so students, and dozens of worn-out costumes. After liberation, with the care and help of the Party and the People's Government, my wishes were realized in just over four years. Now our Xiangyu Troupe has more than 140 people and 60 students. We have more than 1,000 costumes, and the government has also transferred five cadres to us. The troupe has long established a regular learning system. Most of the illiterate comrades have reached the level of elementary school and can read scripts and newspapers. Everyone's ideological awareness has also greatly improved. Now, more than a dozen young people have gloriously joined the Youth League, and many actors and band members have applied to join the Party. In addition, the troupe has also established various systems for rehearsing and performing, holds a life review meeting every week, conducts criticism and self-criticism, and is already carrying out democratic management and living a very orderly democratic life.

Art workers are not only frequently encouraged and assisted by the Party and the People's Government in their work, but their political status has also been unprecedentedly improved and they have received respect that has never been seen in history.

What I will never forget is: In 1952 in Beijing, I attended the reception hosted by Chairman Mao on the eve of National Day. The night I received the notice, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep all night. I thought to myself, if it were in the old society, someone like me, a despised "actor," would never be able to attend this kind of reception in my life. We only knew that artists had turned over after liberation, and we were satisfied that no one would dare to bully us anymore. Who would have thought that we would receive such care and respect?

What I will never forget is: At the end of 1952, I attended the World People's Peace Conference held in Vienna. There, I personally saw the cultural cities of the world turned into ruins under the war disaster of imperialism. I personally saw many actors and musicians there forced to sing in hotels or become unemployed. I personally saw them wandering the streets, haggard like beggars. When I saw them, I thought of my own past. When I saw their miserable lives, I felt even more the happiness and glory of being an actor in the new China, and I couldn't express how grateful I was to the Party and Chairman Mao.

What I will never forget is: In the performances to慰问 the volunteer army and the People's Liberation Army, the army comrades showed a noble love and respect for the actors. When the actors arrived, they ran dozens of miles and put on new uniforms to welcome you! When the actors shook hands with them, they were so enthusiastic and sincere. When the performance was about to begin, they were already sitting neatly waiting for you! When the performance ended, the heroes faced the actors and swore an oath to the motherland, expressing their determination to defend the motherland. We never thought that being an actor would be so glorious!

What I will never forget is: The first national opera festival in 1952. This kind of festival was the first in Chinese history. I witnessed the wonderful performances of twenty or thirty genres. More than a thousand artists from all over the country gathered in Beijing to observe and learn from each other, exchange experiences, and actors of each genre were rewarded by the state. In the old society, I was called a "traitor" to Henan Opera, but at this conference, I was one of those who received a great reward. Through this observation, theatrical workers all over the country, whether playwrights, actors, directors, and the programs performed all over the country, have made tremendous progress and development; and this progress and development is the result of the state's specific assistance. Such encouragement and assistance have never been seen in Chinese history.

This year, I was elected as a representative of the Henan Provincial People's Congress, participated in the Henan Provincial People's Congress, and was gloriously elected as a representative of the National People's Congress by the Henan electoral district. I gloriously participated in the first session of the First National People's Congress and, together with all the representatives, exercised the state's greatest power on behalf of the people of the whole country. I felt that this was a glory that an actor could never have dreamed of. The "actor" of the old society has become a representative of the National People's Congress in the new society. If it were not for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would such a high political status and glory come from? At the same time, I also felt very ashamed, because compared to the work I have done and my progress in politics and art, the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao to me, and the glory and entrustment given to me by the people, are really far, far apart. However, because of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I have the confidence and determination to intensify the transformation of my thinking, improve my political awareness, strive to study my profession, improve my performance level, do a good job of what a people's representative should do, and complete the tasks that a people's actor should complete during the transitional period of the country.

    一个演员的光荣和感激
    常香玉
    一个演员生长在旧社会里，是万分痛苦的。从小时候学戏开始，整天挨打受骂，吃不饱，穿不暖；等你慢慢长大了，会唱戏了，军阀和官僚们的种种压迫和侮辱就都来了！记得在十六年前，我才十三四岁，正是一个天真的小孩子，我爸爸领着我在开封相国寺永安戏院演戏。当时很受群众欢迎，营业情况很好。但是，由于我不懂得地面上统治者的规矩，没有给特务们送礼买账，他们就扬言要赶我出开封。因为群众欢迎，我就是不走。后来他们没办法，就在我化装的时候，向后台扔了手榴弹，只差一丈远没有把我炸死，不幸牺牲了一个化装的同志。这件事发生后反动政府不但不捉拿凶犯，反而把我爸爸和四个演员抓去监禁起来。戏就这样停演了，大家的伙食钱也没有了，无奈何只好离开开封出外去演戏。先到了尉氏县。谁知道尉氏县更厉害，有一个国民党匪军的黄师长是那里的土皇帝，他先是天天看戏不买票，并且不管去不去都得给留下十个座；后来他生了更坏的主意，竟公开的要强迫我作他的小老婆。我气愤极了，就拼着个死命痛快地骂了他一顿。反动派对我们是赶尽杀绝的，首先把同情我的一个房东姓王的拉走枪杀了；晚上又在我们的剧院里扔了两颗手榴弹，还说：“你不开眼，在开封挨手榴弹，在尉氏再叫你尝尝手榴弹。”处在这种险恶的环境，我只得化装成老太婆连夜逃走。眼里噙着悲愤和痛苦的眼泪，被逼离开了心爱的故乡，为了要活命，就决心向陕西逃命。走到密县以后，钱花光了，熟人也少了，常常吃糠吃树皮。到西安的时候，我们很多演员都成为无家可归无路可走的乞丐。有一个名叫小仓的演员，害痢疾没钱治，他还没有咽气，反动派的派出所说他妨碍卫生，硬叫人把这个还活着的人埋了。临埋的时候，小仓还哀求说：我还没有死呀！
    好容易逃到西安，满想着这许要好一些，谁知道在旧社会里处处都是一样，我们又碰上了当时戏剧界有名的三大害：国民党的“青年军”、“军官总”和“荣誉军”。他们几乎是天天砸园子，闹事情，天天叫人提心吊胆，我白天连门都不敢出来！
    一九四八年我们到兰州去演戏。秋天的一个下午，下着倾盆大雨，我又正有着病，马匪鸿逵派人叫我去清唱，我不肯去；停了不久，就来了几个
  “武装”，说：“长官叫你去，是看得起你，别不识抬举，不去也得去！”我被拖去，他们在那里猜拳饮酒，我站在旁边给他们唱戏取乐。这时我嘴里在唱，心里确像刀扎一般。因此每当我读到中华人民共和国宪法第九十五条“中华人民共和国保障公民进行科学研究、文学艺术创作和其他文化活动的自由。国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助。”的时候，我强烈对比地想到了演员在旧社会的遭遇：无情的手榴弹就是反动统治者对艺人的帮助；阴森的监狱就是他们对艺人的鼓励，经常的砸园子便是他们随时随地对艺人的“照顾”了！
    解放以后，一切都改变了，戏院子里天天太平无事，人民解放军不但看戏买票，而且自动的帮助我们维持秩序。政府的戏剧工作干部还经常帮助我们排新戏，帮助我们学文化，讲时事。我很早就有两个志愿：一个是要组织一个健全的剧团，来改进河南梆子；一个是想收一批学生培养后一代。然而在旧社会我想望了许多年，也失望了许多年，剧社只有十几个人，十来个学生和几十件破烂的戏衣。解放后，在党和人民政府的关怀和帮助下，仅仅四年多的光景，我的愿望都实现了。现在我们香玉剧社已经有一百四十多个人，并且有六十个学生，戏衣已经有一千多件，政府还为我们抽调了五个干部。社里早已建立了正规的学习制度，大部分不识字的同志都有了小学程度，都能够读戏词、看报纸。大家的思想觉悟也有很大的提高，现在已有十几个青年光荣的参加了青年团，还有许多演员和乐队的同志申请入党。此外社内还订了各种排戏、演出的制度，每星期开一次生活检讨会，进行批评和自我批评，在社内已经进行着民主管理，过着很有秩序的民主生活。
    艺术工作者不仅在工作上经常受到党和人民政府的鼓励和帮助，特别是政治地位空前的得到提高，受到了历史上永远没有过的尊重。
    使我难忘的是：一九五二年在北京，我参加了毛主席在国庆前夕的招待宴会。当我收到通知的夜里，我兴奋得一夜都睡不着觉，我心里在想，要是旧社会像我这样一个被人瞧不起的“戏子”，一辈子也参加不上这一类的招待会。我们只知道解放以后艺人就翻身了，觉得没有人再敢来欺侮我们就满足了，谁能想到会受到这样的关怀和尊重。
    使我难忘的是：在一九五二年年底，我出席了在维也纳召开的世界人民和平会议，在那里我曾亲眼看见了世界的文化名城在帝国主义的战争灾害下变成废墟；我曾亲眼看见了那里的许多演员和音乐家被逼得串旅馆卖唱或失业；我曾亲眼看见他们流浪街头，憔悴得像乞丐一样。当我看到他们的时候，我就想到了自己的过去，当我看到他们那种悲惨生活的时候，我就愈觉得在新中国作一个演员的幸福和光荣，使我说不出来对于党和毛主席是怎样的感激。
    使我难忘的是：在慰问志愿军和解放军的演出中，军队同志对演员的那种高贵的热爱和尊重。当演员到来的时候，他们跑几十里路，穿上新军装来欢迎你！当演员和他们握手的时候，他们是那么热情和诚挚，当演出快要开始的时候，他们早就坐的整整齐齐等着你！当演出结束的时候，英雄们便面对着演员向祖国宣誓，表示他们保卫祖国的决心，我们真没有想到作一个演员会有这样的光荣！
    使我难忘的是：一九五二年第一次全国戏曲界的会演。这种会演在中国历史上是第一次。我曾眼看到二三十个剧种的精采表演。全国各地一千多位艺人集中到北京，互相观摩学习，交流经验，并且每个剧种的演员都受到了国家的奖励。我在旧社会被称为豫剧的“叛徒”，而在这次大会上我就是受到很大奖励中的一个。通过这次观摩，使全国各地的戏剧工作者，不论剧作家、演员和导演以及全国各地上演的节目，都有了巨大的进步和发展；而这种进步和发展，便是国家具体帮助的结果，像这样的鼓励和帮助，在中国历史上是从来也没见过的。
    今年我被选为河南省人民代表大会的代表，参加了河南省人民代表大会会议；并被河南选区光荣地选为全国人民代表大会的代表，光荣地参加了第
  一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，和全体代表一起代表着全国人民行使了国家最大的权力。我感觉到这是一个演员做梦也想不到的光荣，旧社会的“戏子”在新社会竟作了全国人民代表大会的代表，要不是共产党和毛主席，像这样高的政治地位和光荣，从那里会得来呢？同时我又感到很惭愧，因为我所作的工作和我在政治上艺术上的进步，比起来党和毛主席对我的恩情，人民给我的光荣和委托，实在是相差太远太远了，可是因为有党和毛主席的领导，我是有信心、有决心来加紧改造我的思想，提高我的政治觉悟，努力钻研业务，提高演出水平，来做好一个人民代表应该做的工作，来完成一个人民演员在国家过渡时期应该完成的任务。
