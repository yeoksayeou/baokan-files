    “Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!”
    Introduction to the Chinese Edition, 1954, Issue 41
    The organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1954, Issue 41, has been published.
    This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Glorious Five Years of the German Democratic Republic" celebrating the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The editorial points out that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic has great historical significance for peace in Europe and the world. This is a turning point in European history. For the first time in history, the German nation has established a truly peace-loving democratic country, a country where all power belongs to the people. The past five years have shown the rapid development of the German Democratic Republic's economy and culture, and the continuous improvement of the people's welfare. These achievements prove the vigorous vitality of the new system, and also illustrate the tremendous achievements that the German people can achieve under conditions of peaceful and democratic development. The German Democratic Republic is a fortress of peace and democratic forces in Germany and a strong pillar for the German people's struggle for national unification. The democratic and patriotic forces in Germany resolutely oppose the aggressive policies of Western countries and the Bonn clique in West Germany, and oppose the revival of German militarism. German patriots fully recognize the responsibilities borne by the German people at this stage, and they are uniting to fight for the establishment of a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany.
    This issue also publishes another editorial entitled "The Soviet Union's New Contribution to the Cause of Peace and International Security," commenting on the Soviet Union's new proposal in the United Nations regarding arms reduction. The editorial points out that the powerful movement of people from all countries striving for peace has an increasing impact on the international situation. Due to the direct influence of this movement and the efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other peace-loving countries, international tensions have recently eased somewhat. However, international reactionary groups, primarily the ruling groups in the United States, are taking new steps to obstruct further easing of international tensions and to obstruct the reaching of agreements that conform to the interests of peace-loving people of all countries. The Soviet Union's new proposal once again proves that the Soviet Union has always been the firmest and most reliable defender of peace and international security on the international stage, and that the Soviet Union is determined to do everything possible to prevent a new war and to establish normal relations with all countries. Public opinion around the world welcomes this clear suggestion from the Soviet Union with hope and satisfaction. People of all countries see in the Soviet proposal a path to resolving complex international problems, easing international tensions, and guaranteeing lasting world peace.
    This issue contains speeches by Zhou Enlai and Khrushchev at the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and speeches by Grotewohl and Molotov at the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.
    This issue also contains an article by Dutt, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, entitled "New Features of the National Liberation Struggle in Colonies and Dependent Countries." The article points out that since the Second World War, especially after the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the national liberation movements of the people of colonies and dependent countries have greatly developed and have become more widespread in nature. On the other hand, American imperialism has greatly intensified its offensive, attempting to control and invade the old colonies of Western European countries. This offensive is directed not only at colonies and dependent countries under British rule, but also at Britain itself. Based on this situation, the struggle for national independence can draw the following important conclusions. First, in countries within the sphere of influence of British imperialism, the struggle for national independence is a struggle against both the direct rule of British imperialism and the continuous invasion of American imperialism. Second, the struggle for national independence of the people of various countries within the sphere of influence of British imperialism has become a common struggle of the people of all these countries. Third, the struggle against the war preparations of imperialism headed by American imperialism and the struggle for peace are closely linked to the struggle for national independence. Dutt emphasized that the Chinese People's Revolution and the achievements of the People's Republic of China, as well as the experience of many countries, point out the path of development of a broad national democratic united front led by the working class. The struggle along this path can ultimately achieve complete national liberation and establish a people's democratic system. In such a situation, the role of the Communist Party is particularly important. To successfully complete this task, it is first necessary to establish, develop, and consolidate the Communist Party.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五四年第四十一期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五四年第四十一期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“德意志民主共和国光荣的五年”为题发表社论，庆祝德意志民主共和国建国五周年。社论指出，德意志民主共和国的成立对于欧洲以及全世界的和平具有重大的历史意义。这是欧洲历史的转折点。德意志民族在历史上第一次建立了真正爱好和平的民主国家，一切权力属于人民的国家。过去的五年表明德意志民主共和国的经济和文化有了迅速的发展，人民的福利也在不断地改善。这些成就证明新制度具有蓬勃的生命力，同时也说明德国人民在和平和民主发展的条件下能够取得多么巨大的成就。德意志民主共和国是和平和德国民主力量的堡垒，是德国人民争取国家统一的强有力的支柱。德国的民主爱国力量坚决反对西方国家和西德波恩集团的侵略政策，反对复活德国军国主义。德国的爱国者充分认识到德国人民在现阶段所担负的责任，他们正在团结起来为建立一个统一、民主、爱好和平和独立的德国而斗争。
    这一期还发表了另一篇题为“苏联对和平和国际安全事业的新贡献”的社论，评论苏联在联合国提出的关于裁减军备的新提案。社论指出，各国人民争取和平的强大运动对国际局势的影响越来越大。由于这个运动的直接影响以及苏联、中华人民共和国和其他爱好和平的国家的努力，最近国际紧张局势已经有了某些缓和。但是，国际反动集团，首先是美国统治集团，又在采取新的步骤，阻挠国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，阻挠达成符合爱好和平的各国人民的利益的协议。苏联的新提案再一次证明，苏联在国际舞台上始终是和平和国际安全的最坚定最可靠的保卫者，苏联决定尽一切力量来防止新战争，并同一切国家建立正常的关系。全世界的舆论界怀着希望和满意的心情欢迎苏联的这个明确的建议。各国人民从苏联的提案中看到了解决复杂国际问题、缓和国际紧张局势、保障世界持久和平的道路。
    这一期刊载了周恩来和赫鲁晓夫在中华人民共和国建国五周年国庆庆祝大会上的讲话，格罗提渥和莫洛托夫在德意志民主共和国成立五周年庆祝大会上的演说。
    这一期还刊载了英国共产党执行委员会副主席杜德的题为“殖民地和附属国民族解放斗争的新特点”的文章。文章指出：第二次世界大战以后，尤其是中国人民革命取得胜利以后，殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放运动有了很大的发展，具有更加普遍的性质。另一方面，美帝国主义大大加紧了它的攻势，力图控制和侵入西欧国家的旧殖民地。这种攻势不仅针对着英国统治下的殖民地和附属国，而且也针对着英国本土。根据这种形势，争取民族独立的斗争可以得出下列重要的结论。第一、在属于英帝国主义势力范围的国家中，争取民族独立的斗争，是既反对英帝国主义的直接统治同时又反对美帝国主义的不断侵入的斗争。第二、英帝国主义势力范围以内的各国人民争取民族独立的斗争，已成为所有这些国家的人民的共同斗争。第三、反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的备战活动、争取和平的斗争，同争取民族独立的斗争紧密地联系在一起。杜德着重指出，中国人民的革命和中华人民共和国的成就，以及许多国家的经验，指出了以工人阶级为领导的广泛的民族民主阵线的发展道路。沿着这一条道路进行的斗争能够最后获得彻底的民族解放和建立人民民主制度。在这样的形势之下，共产主义政党的作用是特别重要的。要胜利完成这一任务，首先必须建立、发展并巩固共产主义政党。
