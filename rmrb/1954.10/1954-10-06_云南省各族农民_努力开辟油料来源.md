    Under the leadership and assistance of Party and government leading organs and relevant departments, farmers of all nationalities in Yunnan Province are expanding sources of oil according to local conditions, increasing the production of edible oil and industrial oil. This year, the planting area of oil crops such as rapeseed, peanuts, and beans in the province has been expanded compared with last year, and the yield per unit area has also increased compared with last year. The yield per unit area of peanuts increased by 6% compared with last year, and the total output increased by 38% compared with last year. The total output of rapeseed increased by 4% compared with last year. In Baoshan Prefecture, the fruit of the fragrant fruit tree is used for oil, and in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, lacquer oil, which no one used to pick and squeeze oil from in the past, is now being used for food by the local people, and some of it is being used as industrial oil. Dali Prefecture is rich in walnuts, and this year it has begun to squeeze oil in large quantities. In the first half of the year alone, state-owned trading organizations purchased more than 590,000 jin of walnut oil. In addition, almond from Chenggong and sunflower seeds from Qujing Prefecture can be used to squeeze oil. In the cotton-producing areas such as Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and along the Jinsha River in Lijiang Prefecture, cottonseed will be used to squeeze oil in the future.
    Due to the expansion of oil sources and the increase in output, the edible oil supply problems in Kunming, Gejiu, Dongchuan and other cities and industrial and mining areas have been basically solved, and some difficulties in the edible oil supply in border areas have also been overcome.

    云南省各族农民
    努力开辟油料来源
    云南省各族农民在党、政领导机关和有关部门的领导和帮助下，因地制宜开辟油料来源，增产了许多食油和工业用油。今年全省油菜、花生和豆类等油料作物的种植面积比去年扩大，单位面积产量也比去年提高。花生的单位面积产量比去年提高百分之六，总产量比去年增加百分之三十八。油菜籽的总产量比去年增加百分之四。保山专区的香果油，怒江傈僳族自治区的漆油，过去没有人去采果、榨油，现在已为当地人民食用，并有部分充作工业用油。大理专区盛产核桃，今年已开始大量榨油，仅上半年国营贸易机构收购的核桃油就有五十九万多斤。此外，呈贡等地的杏仁，曲靖专区的葵花子，都可以用来榨油。西双版纳傣族自治区和丽江专区金沙江沿岸等产棉区，今后将利用棉籽榨油。
    由于油料来源的开辟和产量的增加，现在昆明、个旧、东川等城市和工矿区食油供应问题基本上已经得到解决，边疆地区也克服了食油供应上的一些困难。　（新华社）
