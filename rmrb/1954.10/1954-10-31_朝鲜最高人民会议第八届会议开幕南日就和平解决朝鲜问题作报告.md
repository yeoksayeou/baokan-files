Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 30th: The Eighth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opened in Pyongyang on the 28th.

    The tasks of this session are: to listen to and approve the report by Foreign Minister Nam Il on the work of the delegation of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean question; to approve the reports submitted by the Cabinet on the organization law of local power organs and on the reorganization of local administrative divisions; and to approve the decrees issued by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly.

    In the first day's session, Foreign Minister Nam Il delivered a report on the work of the delegation of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

    In his report, Foreign Minister Nam Il pointed out that the Geneva Conference, due to the obstruction of the United States and its lackeys, failed to complete its task on the Korean question. However, the Korean question has not been removed from the agenda and cannot be removed. The just resolution of the Korean question is not only the urgent demand of the Korean people but also the urgent demand of the people of Asia and the world who are concerned about easing international tensions and maintaining and consolidating overall peace.

    Nam Il said: The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea advocates that the countries concerned find ways to resume discussion of the Korean question in order to finally resolve it. The Republic government fully supports the proposal put forward in the joint declaration issued by the Soviet government and the Chinese government on October 12, 1954, namely, "In view of the fact that the reunification of Korea is one of the important tasks, and the solution of this task is of great significance for consolidating peace in the Far East, the two governments believe that it is necessary to convene a conference to discuss the Korean issue in the near future, with the broad participation of the countries concerned."

    Nam Il said: We must, through unremitting efforts and struggles, eliminate all obstacles of the enemy and seek and implement countermeasures that can promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland. To develop friendly relations in all aspects between the people of North and South Korea and to discuss the issue of peaceful reunification of the motherland, we welcome consultations in any form, gathered together by various political parties, social organizations, people from all walks of life, the government, or by representatives of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the National Assembly of South Korea. He said: Now, it is an unavoidable and necessary measure for the people of North and South Korea to make contact. The time for friendly contact between the people of North and South Korea has matured, and this contact will become the practical first step in promoting the cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    Nam Il then said: It is necessary for us to create conditions to ensure that the people of North and South Korea can visit each other freely, exchange letters, and conduct economic and cultural exchanges. All the achievements we have made in the northern half of the Republic are not only for the people of the northern half but also for all the people of Korea. For the working people in the southern half, our sanatoriums, convalescent homes, hospitals, and clinics are always open. Our maternal and child health centers, nurseries, schools, and universities are always preparing seats for orphans and adolescents in the southern half. For art workers in the southern half to perform, our theaters and clubs are always ready to provide stages; our art workers are also willing to show their artistic creations to the people in the southern half. Our sports personnel in the northern half are always ready to conduct friendly sports competitions with sports personnel in the southern half. Staff and businessmen from state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives in the northern half are willing to consult with business and commercial circles in the southern half on the issue of starting trade between the North and the South. There is no doubt that this economic and cultural exchange between North and South Korea will make a great contribution to the great cause of the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    Nam Il pointed out: Our position and stance are very clear, that is, Korea should be handed over to the Koreans, the Korean question should be resolved by the Koreans themselves, the Koreans themselves should gather together, and the United States should withdraw from Korea.

    Nam Il said: Loyal to its peace policy, the government of the Republic will strive to establish diplomatic relations with any country and strengthen ties with these countries in matters of mutual concern on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.

    Nam Il also said: Further strengthening economic and cultural ties with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other brother countries is our sacred duty. The continuous assistance provided by these countries to help us restore and build our people's economy, which has been damaged by the war, is one of the important guarantees for our victory in achieving the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    Nam Il pointed out: In order to maintain peace in the Far East and the world, the government of the Republic will wage a more tenacious struggle against the instigators of war and resolutely oppose the revival of Japanese militarism. The Japanese government must respect the legitimate rights and interests of our compatriots residing in Japan and promptly abolish its discriminatory policies against them.

    Nam Il said: In order to consolidate the Korean armistice, the Korean people must continue to faithfully abide by the armistice agreement, pay close attention to all provocative acts of the enemy with high vigilance, and continuously strengthen the defense of the Republic.

    Nam Il concluded by saying: The government of the Republic will invariably pursue its peace policy and contribute all its strength to the peaceful reunification of the motherland, easing international tensions, and strengthening international peace and cooperation. Our just cause will receive the unanimous support of peace-loving people all over the world and will surely achieve victory.

    朝鲜最高人民会议第八届会议开幕
    南日就和平解决朝鲜问题作报告
    【新华社平壤三十日电】　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议第八届会议二十八日在平壤开幕。
    此次会议的任务是：听取和批准南日外务相所作的关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团在日内瓦会议上对和平解决朝鲜问题的工作报告；批准内阁提出的关于地方政权机关的组织法、关于改编地方行政区域划分的报告；批准最高人民会议常任委员会所发布的政令。
    在第一天会议上，由南日外务相作关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团在日内瓦会议上对和平解决朝鲜问题的工作报告。
    南日外务相在报告中指出：日内瓦会议由于美国和它的仆从们的阻挠，未能在朝鲜问题上完成它所负担的任务。但是，朝鲜问题并没有从议程上抹掉，并且是不能被抹掉的。朝鲜问题的正当解决，不仅是朝鲜人民的迫切要求，而且是关心缓和国际紧张局势、维护和巩固全面和平的亚洲及全世界人民的迫切要求。
    南日说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府主张有关国家找出重新讨论朝鲜问题的途径，以便最后解决朝鲜问题。共和国政府完全支持苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府在一九五四年十月十二日发表的联合宣言中所提出的主张，即“鉴于朝鲜的统一是重要任务之一，而这一任务的解决对巩固远东和平具有巨大意义，两国政府认为有必要在最近的将来召开讨论朝鲜问题的会议，由有关各国广泛参加”。
    南日说：我们必须以不懈的努力和斗争，排除敌人的一切阻碍，寻求和实现能够促进祖国和平统一的对策。我们为发展南北朝鲜人民之间的各方面的友谊关系和讨论关于和平统一祖国的问题，欢迎任何形式的协商，由各政党、社会团体、各阶层人士、政府或由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议和南朝鲜国会代表聚集在一起进行协商。他说：现在，南北朝鲜人民进行接触，是不可拖延的必须采取的措施。南北朝鲜人民友爱的互相接触的时机已经成熟了，这种接触将会成为促进祖国的和平统一事业中的实际的第一步。
    南日接着说：我们有必要创造条件来保证南北朝鲜人民能够互相来往，交换信件，并进行经济和文化交流的自由。我们在共和国北半部所取得的一切成果，不仅是为了北半部人民，而且也是为了全朝鲜的人民。为了南半部的劳动人民，我们的休养所、疗养所、医院和诊疗所任何时候都在开着大门。我们的爱育院、养育院、学校和大学任何时候都在为南半部的孤儿和青、少年准备着座位。为了南半部艺术工作者进行公演，我们的剧场和俱乐部在任何时候都准备提供舞台；我们的艺术工作者也愿向南半部人民表演自己的艺术创造成果。我们北半部的体育人员们经常都准备同南半部的体育人员进行友谊的运动竞赛。北半部的国营商店、消费合作社的工作人员和商人们，愿与南半部的实业界和商业界人士就关于开始南北之间通商的问题进行协商。毫无疑问，这种南北朝鲜之间的经济和文化交流将对朝鲜的和平统一的伟大事业作出巨大的贡献。
    南日指出：我们的主张和立场是很明确的，就是朝鲜应该交给朝鲜人，朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人自己解决，朝鲜人自己应共聚在一起，美国应当从朝鲜撤出。
    南日说：忠实于和平政策的共和国政府将进行努力，在平等互惠、互相尊重领土完整和主权的原则基础上，同任何国家建立外交关系，并加强与这些国家的事务的联系。
    南日又说：进一步加强与苏联、中华人民共和国及其他各兄弟国家的经济和文化的联系，是我们的神圣义务。这些国家为了协助我们恢复和建设遭受战争破坏的我国人民经济所给予的不断的援助，是我们在达成祖国的和平统一的伟大事业中取得胜利的重要保证之一。
      南日指出：共和国政府为了远东和世界的和平将进行更加顽强的斗争来反对战争挑拨者，并坚决反对复活日本军国主义。日本政府必须尊重我国在日侨胞的合法权利和利益，迅速废除对他们歧视的政策。
    南日说：为了巩固朝鲜的停战，朝鲜人民要继续忠实遵守停战协定，以高度的警惕注视敌人的一切挑衅行为，不断地加强共和国的防卫。
    南日最后说：共和国政府将不变地奉行自己的和平政策，为了祖国的和平统一，缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际和平与合作而贡献一切力量。我们的正义事业将得到全世界爱好和平人民的一致支持，必将获得胜利。
