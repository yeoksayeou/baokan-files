    Congratulations on the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the German Democratic Republic
    Today, the German people are jubilantly celebrating the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The Chinese people and all progressive humanity also congratulate the German people on this significant day with great joy. The government delegation dispatched by our government, headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi, has arrived in Berlin to participate in the celebrations. Chairman Mao Zedong's congratulatory telegram to President Wilhelm Pieck of the German Democratic Republic stated: "The fraternal friendship and close cooperation in economic and cultural fields between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are developing more and more. The just cause of the German people in striving for the establishment of a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany has received the profound sympathy of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people." This further expresses the deep friendship and feelings of the Chinese people towards the German people.
    The German Democratic Republic grew up on the basis of democratic reforms after the crushing of Hitler's fascist rule and the crushing of German militarism. Since its founding five years ago, the German Democratic Republic has shown the world its great vitality and powerful development. It is advancing along the road of socialist construction and ensuring the economic and cultural upsurge and continuous improvement of the material conditions of the working people. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the workers and peasants of the German Democratic Republic have formed a solid alliance and are victoriously building a new life. The achievements of industrial construction in the German Democratic Republic are significant, and the proportion of the people's economy in industry has occupied an overwhelming advantage. By the beginning of 1954, the total amount of industrial production had increased to 177 percent of the pre-war year of 1936. The rapid development of industry has created the necessary conditions for the further upsurge of agriculture. Now, its industry is beginning to fully supply the machinery, fertilizers, and various industrial products needed by agriculture. The number of machine tractor stations in rural areas is increasing, and technical equipment is constantly being strengthened. Due to the continuous development of industry and agriculture, the German Democratic Republic has completely eliminated unemployment. Since the implementation of the new policy of developing the production of necessities to improve the material and cultural life of the working people in 1953, prices have been reduced several times, and the living welfare of the working people has been continuously improved. The working people of the German Democratic Republic are confidently moving towards a prosperous and happy future in economic and cultural construction, which makes the Chinese people and all sincere friends of the German people feel excited.
    At present, the important task of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic is to strive to restore the unification of Germany on the basis of peace, democracy, and independence, so that the German people will forever be freed from the road of war disaster and embark on the road of peaceful development, which is the most important prerequisite for guaranteeing European peace. In the struggle to achieve this goal, the government and people of the German Democratic Republic have been making unremitting efforts and have received the full support of the peace-loving people of all countries, especially the Soviet government and people. The Soviet government has strived to safeguard the interests of the German people at all international conferences and has repeatedly put forward constructive proposals to Western countries for concluding a peace treaty with Germany and restoring German unification. The government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic have repeatedly made proposals to the West German Bonn government, advocating that the German issue be resolved peacefully on the basis of an agreement reached by the Germans themselves, and that national unification be achieved. In order to promote broad all-German agreements and restore German unification, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic has further advocated that the relations between the East and West parts of Germany should be rapidly normalized, domestic trade should be immediately relaxed and expanded, German foreign trade should be promoted, a unified German currency system should be restored, and German culture should be developed. These concrete suggestions of the German Democratic Republic embody the will of the entire German people and have not only been warmly welcomed by West German patriots, but also praised by the governments and people of all countries who wish for a peaceful solution to the German issue and the establishment of a collective peaceful and secure Europe.
    However, the Western imperialist countries, especially U.S. imperialism, which are enemies of the German people, have consistently adopted a policy of dividing Germany on the German issue since the war. They have rejected all the constructive proposals put forward by the Soviet government aimed at concluding a peace treaty with Germany and restoring German unification, and have instigated the West German government to refuse to consider all the proposals put forward by the government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic aimed at opening the way for a peaceful solution to the German issue. On the contrary, the Western countries and the Bonn government have signed the Bonn and Paris war treaties, attempting to deepen the division of Germany, and have revived the German militarist forces within the scope of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, creating a serious threat to European peace and security. In order to undermine the resistance of the German people to this war policy, the Adenauer government in Bonn has adopted brutal suppression against the democratic forces in West Germany, and has supported various fascist organizations in West Germany, spreading seeds of division and hatred among the West German people. This war policy of the Western countries and the Bonn government, which divides Germany and threatens European peace and security, fundamentally violates the national interests of the German people and is completely incompatible with the interests of the peace-loving people of Western Europe.
    The French National Assembly's rejection of the "European Army" treaty reflects the French people's desire for peace and has opened up new prospects for a peaceful solution to the German issue and the easing of the European situation. However, the rulers of the Western countries, disregarding the peace aspirations of the people of France, Germany, and other Western European countries, hastily convened a nine-nation conference in London and, according to the U.S. plan, signed the so-called "Final Resolution" to revive the German militarist forces, intending to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc as a tool for launching aggressive wars and creating tension in Europe. Although this new U.S.-orchestrated plan to arm West Germany has made some formal restrictions and is disguised with some pleasant words, it is obviously only a continuation of the already bankrupt "European Army" treaty, and its purpose is still to piece together a Western European military group dominated by West German militarists and revanchists. They disguise it in order to deceive the people of all countries and make it easier to pass in the parliaments of various countries. This new plan to arm West Germany undoubtedly deepens the division of Germany, makes the solution of the German unification issue more difficult, and seriously threatens the peace and security of European countries.
    However, it cannot be ignored that the peace-loving people of Western European countries are increasingly and fiercely opposing the revival of German militarist forces. They demand a peaceful solution to the German issue to ensure European peace and security. The London Nine-Power Conference's heinous plan to revive German militarism not only cannot deceive the peace-loving people of Western European countries, but will certainly be resolutely resisted by the peace-loving people of Western European countries. The fate of the German people is by no means determined by the London Nine-Power Conference, but depends on the German people's struggle to restore German unification on a peaceful and democratic basis. The German people's struggle to achieve national unification and ensure collective European peace and security is a just cause, which has won the support of the people of the world and cannot be absolutely prevented by any reactionary force.
    The German people's just struggle to establish a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany has won the deep sympathy and full support of the peace-loving and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union. For five years, the people of China and Germany have maintained a deep friendship, established close cooperative and friendly relations in the economic and cultural fields, and jointly supported each other's struggle to safeguard peace. The Chinese people are concerned about and support the German people's struggle to achieve a peaceful solution to the unification issue of their own country. In July this year, Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Premier Otto Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic exchanged views on further developing the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries and safeguarding peace during their meeting. The communiqué of the meeting between the two premiers stated: "Both sides expressed their determination to continue the policy of international peace cooperation and friendship among the people, not to tolerate foreign interference in the internal affairs of their respective countries and the infringement of their national sovereignty, and are willing to do their utmost to work to ease international tensions." The desire and confidence expressed by the two premiers to promote international peace, friendship, and cooperation will help maintain peace in Europe, Asia, and the world. Any sinister conspiracy plan by Western countries to infringe upon the national sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, revive German militarist forces, thereby deepening the division of Germany and threatening European peace and security, will be resolutely opposed by the 600 million people of China.
    Since the founding of the German Democratic Republic five years ago, its consolidation in politics and economy, its expanding influence in the international arena, especially the unbreakable and permanent friendship and cooperation established with the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, have made the German Democratic Republic the pillar of patriotic forces in all of Germany and an important force for guaranteeing European peace and security. We wish the German Democratic Republic greater achievements in its construction cause, in the cause of uniting all the German people to build a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany.

### 祝贺德意志民主共和国成立五周年

    祝贺德意志民主共和国成立五周年
    德国人民今天正在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝德意志民主共和国成立五周年。中国人民和全体进步人类同样以极大的喜悦心情，祝贺德国人民这个意义重大的日子。我国政府派遣的以陈毅副总理为首的政府代表团，已经到达柏林参加庆典。毛泽东主席致德意志民主共和国威廉·皮克总统的贺电中说：“中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的兄弟友谊和在经济上、文化上的密切合作正在越来越发展。德意志人民为争取建立统一、和平、民主和独立的德国而进行的正义事业，得到了中华人民共和国和中国人民的深厚同情。”这更表达了中国人民对于德国人民的深厚友谊和感情。
    德意志民主共和国是在粉碎了希特勒法西斯统治、粉碎了德国军国主义以后，在民主改革的基础上成长起来的。建国五年以来，德意志民主共和国向全世界显示出它的伟大的生命力和强大发展，它正在沿着社会主义建设的道路前进，并保证着劳动人民经济、文化的高涨和物质状况的不断改善。在德国统一社会党的领导下，德意志民主共和国的工人和农民结成了牢固的联盟，胜利地建设着新的生活。德意志民主共和国的工业建设成就是重大的，人民经济在工业中的比重已占压倒的优势。到一九五四年初，工业生产品的总量，已经增加到战前一九三六年的百分之一百七十七。工业的迅速发展为农业的进一步高涨创造了必要的条件。现在，它的工业开始能够充分地供应农业所需要的机器、肥料和各种工业品。农村中的机器拖拉机站的数目正在增加，技术设备不断加强。由于工农业的不断发展，德意志民主共和国已经完全消灭了失业的现象。一九五三年开始实施发展必需品生产以改善劳动人民物质和文化生活的新方针以来，几次减低了物价，使劳动人民的生活福利得到了不断的提高。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民在经济和文化建设中正满怀信心地朝着繁荣幸福的美好未来前进，使中国人民和所有德国人民的真诚朋友都感到兴奋。
    现在，德意志民主共和国政府和德国人民的重要任务，是争取在和平民主独立的基础上恢复德国的统一，使德国人民永远脱离战争灾难的道路，而走上和平发展的道路，这是保障欧洲和平的最重要的先决条件。在争取实现这个目标的斗争中，德意志民主共和国政府和人民一直进行着不懈的努力，并且得到了各国和平人民、首先是苏联政府和人民的全力支持。苏联政府在一切国际会议上都竭力维护德国人民的利益，一再向西方国家提出了为缔结对德和约与恢复德国统一的建设性的建议。德意志民主共和国的政府和人民议院，更一再向西德波恩政府提出建议，主张在德国人自己取得协议的基础上和平解决德国问题，实现国家的统一。为了促成广泛的全德协议和恢复德国的统一，德意志民主共和国人民议院更主张首先使德国东西两部分的关系迅速正常化起来，立即放宽和扩大国内贸易，促进德国的对外贸易，恢复统一的德国币制，发展德国的文化。德意志民主共和国的这些具体建议，体现了全体德国人民的意志，不仅得到了西德爱国人士的热烈欢迎，也得到了一切愿望德国问题和平解决、建立欧洲集体和平安全的国家政府和人民的赞扬。
    但是，与德国人民为敌的西方帝国主义国家，特别是美帝国主义，战后以来在德国问题上一直采取了分裂德国的政策。它们拒绝苏联政府提出的旨在缔结对德和约与恢复德国统一的所有建设性的建议，并唆使西德政府拒不考虑德意志民主共和国政府和人民议院提出的旨在打开和平解决德国问题的道路的一切主张。相反地，西方国家及波恩政府却签订了波恩和巴黎战争条约，企图加深德国的分裂，而且在侵略性的北大西洋公约的范围内复活德国军国主义势力，造成对欧洲和平与安全的严重威胁。为了破坏德国人民群众对这种战争政策的反抗，波恩的阿登纳政府对西德的民主力量采取了野蛮的镇压，并扶植西德的各种法西斯组织，在西德人民中大量散布分裂和仇恨的种子。西方国家及波恩政府这种分裂德国、威胁欧洲和平与安全的战争政策，根本违背了德国人民的民族利益，也是与西欧各国和平人民的利益完全不相容的。
    法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲军”条约，反映了法国人民要求和平的愿望，为和平解决德国问题与缓和欧洲局势展开了新的前景。可是，西方国家的统治者们不顾法国、德国和西欧其他国家人民的和平愿望，仓忙地在伦敦召开了九国会议，并按照美国的计划签订了复活德国军国主义势力的所谓
  “最后决议书”，要把西德拖进北大西洋侵略集团，作为它在欧洲发动侵略战争、制造紧张局势的工具。尽管美国策划的这个新的武装西德的计划，在形式上作了某些限制，并用一些动听的词句伪装起来了，但是显然只是那已经破产了的“欧洲军”条约的继续，其目的仍然是在拼凑以西德军国主义分子和复仇主义者为主体的西欧军事集团。他们把它伪装起来，为的是欺骗各国人民，使之在各国议会容易获得通过。这个新的武装西德的计划，无疑地加深了德国的分裂，使德国统一问题的解决更加困难，并严重地威胁着欧洲各国的和平与安全。
    但是，不能不看到，西欧各国爱好和平人民正日益激烈地反对德国军国主义势力的复活，他们要求和平解决德国问题，以保障欧洲的和平与安全。伦敦九国会议复活德国军国主义的罪恶计划，不仅欺骗不了西欧各国爱好和平人民，而且一定会遭到西欧各国爱好和平人民的坚决抗击。德国人民的命运，决不是伦敦九国会议所能决定的，而是取决于德国人民所进行的争取在和平民主基础上恢复德国统一的斗争。德国人民争取国家统一，保障欧洲集体和平安全的斗争，是正义的事业，得到了全世界人民的支持，是任何反动势力所绝对阻止不住的。
    德国人民为争取建立统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国而进行的正义斗争，获得以苏联为首的和平民主国家的深厚同情和全力支持。五年来，中德两国人民一直保持着深厚的友谊，在经济和文化上建立了密切合作的友好关系，并共同为维护和平事业进行了互相支援的斗争。中国人民关切和支持德国人民为争取和平解决自己的国家统一问题的斗争。今年七月间，我国周恩来总理和德意志民主共和国奥托·格罗提渥总理在会见中，曾就进一步发展两国间的友好合作关系和维护和平的问题，互相交换了意见。两国总理的会谈公报中说：“双方表示，坚决继续国际和平合作和人民友好的政策，不容忍外国干涉它们各自的国家的内政和侵犯它们的民族主权，并愿竭尽全力为缓和国际紧张局势而工作。”两国总理所表示的这个促进国际和平友好与合作的愿望和信心，有助于维护欧洲和亚洲以及全世界的和平。西方国家任何侵犯德意志民主共和国民族主权，复活德国军国主义势力，从而加深德国分裂，威胁欧洲和平安全的罪恶阴谋计划，都将遭到全中国六亿人民的坚决反对。
    德意志民主共和国成立五年以来，在政治和经济上的巩固，在国际上影响的扩大，尤其是和苏联、中国与各人民民主国家间结成了牢不可破的永久友谊和合作，已使德意志民主共和国成为全德国爱国力量的支柱，成为保证欧洲和平与安全的重要力量。祝德意志民主共和国在建设事业中，在团结全德国人民建立一个统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国的事业中，获得更大的成就。
