The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests in autumn and winter. The notice states: Actively preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests in the autumn and winter seasons is a powerful measure to ensure full seedling emergence and reduce the occurrence of diseases and insects in the coming year. In order to do a good job in the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in autumn and winter, and to create conditions for increased agricultural production in 1955, all localities are required to greatly use 666 poisoned grains to control underground pests, especially in areas with serious underground pests such as Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shanxi. We must do a good job in technical instruction and drug supply. The method of using 666 powder to mix seeds to control wireworms should be demonstrated first and gradually promoted, as the technology is more difficult to master, so as to avoid drug damage. In areas where the masses are accustomed to using red and white arsenic to control underground insects, they should also be persuaded to gradually replace them with 666 poisoned grains to avoid incidents of poisoning of humans and animals. For wheat stinking smut and flag smut, which are serious in Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Shaanxi and other provinces, in addition to organizing the masses to carry out drug seed mixing and combined fecal seed isolation and other methods for prevention and control, attention should be paid to the selection of disease-resistant varieties. Other regions should also carry out planned prevention and control demonstrations. All localities can also adopt water selection (mud water, salt water, etc.) or use machinery to eliminate wheat nematode disease galls and other methods, depending on local conditions. Provinces in locust areas should, on the basis of ascertaining the residual autumn locusts, carefully investigate the distribution, area, density, and types of locust eggs, especially in highlands, wheat fields, roadsides, and ditch edges. Based on the egg survey, make all preparations for drug locust control in 1955. Provinces such as Shandong and Henan, where soil locusts seriously threaten wheat seedling growth, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, can use the remaining locust control drugs and machinery and wheat bran to make poisonous bait to lure and kill soil locusts and protect wheat seedlings. This winter, provinces in rice areas, in addition to making preparations for drugs and machinery for vigorous prevention and control of rice pests next year, can combine autumn and winter agricultural activities to control overwintering rice borers according to local conditions, so as to reduce the occurrence of rice borers in the coming year. All cotton-producing areas should vigorously publicize to cotton farmers the benefits of using DDT and other methods to prevent and control overwintering cotton bollworms, and strengthen technical guidance. Where conditions permit, the masses can be mobilized to collect insects, collect pupae, and clean up cotton fields and orchards in combination with autumn and winter plowing. At present, all localities should seize the work of clearing and investigating, and make full use of existing drugs to prevent and control late cotton insects, underground insects, and vegetable pests. At the same time, agricultural departments at all levels should assist supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in training drug and machinery promotion cadres.

    农业部通知各地加强秋冬防治病虫害工作
    农业部最近发出秋冬防治病虫害的通知。通知说：秋冬季节积极防治病虫害，是保证全苗和减轻来年病虫发生的有力措施。为了作好秋冬病虫防治工作，为一九五五年农业增产创造条件，要求各地大大使用六六六毒谷防治地下害虫，特别是河南、河北、江苏、山东、山西等地下虫严重地区，更要作好技术传授和药剂供应等工作，用六六六药粉拌种防治金针虫的办法，因技术较难掌握，应先行示范，逐步推广，以免发生药害。群众习惯使用红、白砒防治地下虫的地区，亦应说服群众逐步以六六六毒谷代替，以免发生人畜中毒事件。小麦腥黑穗病、杆黑粉病害严重的山东、河南、江苏、陕西等省，除组织群众进行药剂拌种和结合粪种隔离等办法进行防治外，应注意选用抗病品种，其他地区亦应有计划地进行防治示范。各地还可因地制宜，分别采用水选（泥水、盐水等）或用器械汰除小麦线虫病虫瘿等办法。蝗区各省应在查清残余秋蝗的基础上，认真侦查蝗卵的分布、面积、密度和种类，特别是高地、麦田、路旁、沟边等地带的查卵工作。并根据查卵的情况，做好一九五五年药剂治蝗的一切准备工作，土蝗严重威胁麦苗生长的山东、河南等省和内蒙古自治区，可利用本省治蝗剩余药械、麦麸拌制毒饵，诱杀土蝗，保护麦苗。今冬稻区各省，除应作好明年大力防治水稻害虫的药械等准备工作外，可根据当地情况，结合秋冬农事活动防治过冬螟虫，以减少来年螟虫的发生。各棉区应大力向棉农宣传用滴滴涕等办法防治越冬红铃虫的好处，并加强技术指导。有条件地区可结合秋耕、冬耕，发动群众拾虫、拾蛹和清整棉田、果园等工作。目前各地应抓紧清查工作，尽量利用现存药剂，防治后期棉虫、地下虫、蔬菜害虫等；同时各级农业部门应协助各级供销合作社训练药械推广干部。
