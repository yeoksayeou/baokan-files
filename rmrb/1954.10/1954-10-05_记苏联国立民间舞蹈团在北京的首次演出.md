    On the First Performance of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble in Beijing
    Bai Sheng
    On the evening of October 4th, the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble grandly held its first performance at Huairentang in Beijing. Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, and the Soviet government delegation headed by Khrushchev watched the dance troupe's performance.
    This was a cordial and friendly performance. When the golden velvet curtain was drawn open, thunderous applause welcomed the dancers of the troupe.
    Whether it was the vivid courtship scene in the "Summer Dance" from the Russian suite "The Four Seasons", or the happy scene in the polka dance "Mama" from the dance drama "Collective Farm Festival" where the mother hero meets her eight young sons and fiancées, or the fifteen young and beautiful Belarusian girls in the "Potato" dance created by Moiseyev based on the theme and melody of a beautiful Belarusian folk song "Potato", digging potatoes in the field, that wonderful dance picture, or the dance drama "Guerrillas" which expresses the Soviet people's patriotism in the Soviet Patriotic War, all these made people feel that the image of Soviet folk dance art is so glorious and bright, beautiful and vivid. From this, one could feel how happy the labor life of the Soviet people is, and the optimistic spirit of the Soviet people. All these programs won enthusiastic applause from the audience again and again.
    The dance troupe also successfully performed many dances from people's democratic countries. There was the wonderfully lyrical and uniquely styled Korean dance "Chailang and the Village Girl", the beautiful Polish dance "Oberek" full of ingenious techniques, sometimes slow and sometimes rapidly spinning, the Romanian dance "Briul" with its vivid form and great expressiveness, as well as the humorous and lightly spinning Czechoslovakian dance, the Hungarian "Puntosó" dance which expresses the beautiful posture of men and the extraordinarily beautiful melody of the dance, and the "Knight" dance full of the heroic spirit of Mongolian cavalry...
    However, among the performance programs, the most moving and familiar to the Chinese audience were the two Chinese dances performed by the dance troupe's excellent actors: one was the Chinese classical pantomime "San岔口 (Three Crossings)", and the other was the Chinese "Red Silk Dance".
      "San岔口 (Three Crossings)", a classical pantomime with a unique Chinese style and strong national characteristics, completely expresses the plot of the play through dance movements. However, the actors of our excellent Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble, Lie. Golovanov and Hua. Savin, played the Chinese roles so kindly and realistically. What is particularly touching and admirable is that they have mastered the complex techniques of Chinese classical dance so skillfully, vividly conveying the plot of this tense and exciting fight in the dark. Their brilliant performance won repeated enthusiastic applause from the audience.
    In the "Red Silk Dance", the graceful figures of the Chinese girls played by Soviet actors, and the beautiful red silk fluttering across the entire stage like torches, fully expressed the magnificent and majestic atmosphere of Chinese folk dance and the Chinese national sentiment.
    Each dance from these people's democratic countries revealed the unique style of the people of different nationalities in front of the audience, and also deeply embodied the close friendship between the Soviet people and the people of all people's democratic countries.

    记苏联国立民间舞蹈团在北京的首次演出
    柏生
    十月四日晚上，苏联国立民间舞蹈团在北京怀仁堂隆重地举行了第一次演出。中国人民领袖毛泽东主席和以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联政府代表团都观看了舞蹈团的演出。
    这是一次亲切而友好的演出，当金黄色的丝绒幕布拉开的时候，春雷般的掌声欢迎着舞蹈团的演员们。
    这里无论是俄罗斯组舞“四季”中的“夏舞”的生动的求婚的情节，或是舞剧“集体农庄的节日”中的波尔卡舞——“妈妈”中的母亲英雄和她的八个年青儿子和未婚妻见面时的幸福情景，或是莫伊塞耶夫以白俄罗斯的一首美丽的民歌“马铃薯”的题材和旋律，创造的“马铃薯”舞中的十五个年轻美丽的白俄罗斯姑娘，在田野里挖掘着马铃薯时的那一幅美妙的舞蹈图画，或是表现苏联卫国战争中苏联人民的爱国主义精神的舞剧“游击队员”，都使人感到苏维埃民间舞蹈艺术的形象是如此的光辉和明朗，美丽而生动。从这里可以感到苏联人民的劳动生活是多么幸福，和苏联人民的乐观主义精神。所有这些节目都一次再一次地博得了观众的热烈掌声。
    舞蹈团还成功地上演了许多人民民主国家的舞蹈，这里有美妙抒情，别具风格的朝鲜舞蹈“柴郎与村女”，有充满巧妙的技巧，时而缓慢时而急速旋转的美丽的波兰舞蹈“奥别列克”，有形式生动，极富有表现力的罗马尼亚舞蹈“布里乌尔”，也有幽默、轻盈旋转的捷克斯洛伐克舞，还有表现男性优美姿态，舞蹈旋律异常美妙的匈牙利的“朋托索奥”舞，和富有蒙古骑兵英勇风度的“骑士”舞……。
    然而演出节目中，最使中国观众感动和亲切的节目还是舞蹈团的优秀演员演出的两个中国舞蹈，
  一个是中国古典哑剧“三岔口”，一个是中国的“红绸舞”。
      “三岔口”这个具有中国独特风格和浓厚民族色彩的古典哑剧，是完全用舞蹈的动作表达剧中情节的，然而我们卓越的苏联国立民间舞蹈团的演员列·高洛万诺夫和华·萨文，是那么亲切而逼真地扮演着中国的角色，尤其令人感动和佩服的是他们竟然那么熟练地掌握了中国古典舞蹈的复杂的技术，生动地传达出了这个在黑暗中进行的一场紧张精采搏斗的哑剧的情节。他们精采的演出获得了观众的一再热烈的掌声。
    “红绸舞”中，苏联演员扮演的中国姑娘们的优美身姿，和那飘扬在整个舞台上的美丽的像火把
  一样的红绸，都充分地表现了中国民间舞蹈的壮丽雄伟的气氛和中国的民族情调。
    这里的每一个人民民主国家的舞蹈都在观众面前揭示了不同民族人民的独特的风格，同时也深深地体现了苏联人民和各人民民主国家人民之间的亲密的友谊。
