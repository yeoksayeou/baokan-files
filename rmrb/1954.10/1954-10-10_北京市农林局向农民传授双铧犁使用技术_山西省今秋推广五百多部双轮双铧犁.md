    The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry recently conducted training on the use of double-wheel double-share plows in the suburban areas, training more than 1,100 people in six districts. More than 20 cadres from supply and marketing cooperatives also learned the techniques of installing, repairing, and using double-share plows.
    Farmers are eager to use the double-share plow because they see that it can plow twelve to twenty mu of land per day and saves livestock and labor compared to the old plows and foot plows. Women, in particular, welcome the double-share plow because plowing is not as strenuous as using old plows and foot plows. Therefore, the twelve double-share plows brought for the training were all kept by the agricultural production cooperatives, and farmers have recently purchased more than 100 from the supply and marketing cooperatives.
    Of the 540 double-wheel double-share plows ordered by Shanxi Province from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory this autumn, 240 have been delivered successively. They have been distributed to Yanbei, Xin County, Changzhi, Yuci, and other special districts. These double-share plows are mainly being promoted in areas with saline-alkali soil, cotton and grain production areas, and areas with a relatively good foundation for the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Currently, various localities are training promotion cadres and teaching installation, repair, and usage techniques.

    北京市农林局向农民传授双铧犁使用技术
    山西省今秋推广五百多部双轮双铧犁
    北京市农林局最近在郊区进行了双轮双铧犁使用技术的传授工作，先后在六个区分别训练了一千一百多人。并有二十多名供销合作社干部学会了双铧犁的安装、修理、使用技术。
    农民们看到双铧犁一天能耕地十二到二十亩，又比旧犁、步犁省牲口、省人工，大家都愿意使用。特别是妇女们更欢迎双铧犁，耕起地来，不像使用旧犁、步犁那样费劲。因此，这次传授时带下去的十二件双铧犁，都被各农业生产合作社留下了，最近农民又向供销社购买了一百多件。
    山西省今秋向北京农业机械厂订购的五百四十部双轮双铧犁，已有二百四十部陆续运到。并已分发到雁北、忻县、长治、榆次等专区。这批双铧犁主要在盐碱土性地区、棉粮产区和互助合作运动发展基础较好的地区推广。目前各地正在训练推广干部，传授安装、修理、使用技术。
