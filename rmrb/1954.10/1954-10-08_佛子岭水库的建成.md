The Fotzuling Reservoir was completed in August of this year. It is a large-scale water conservancy project built by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the help of Soviet experts. The completion of this reservoir marks a new advance in China's water conservancy engineering technology.

The Fotzuling Reservoir is located in the Dabie Mountains, which used to be a revolutionary base area. In order to fundamentally control the Huai River and block the floodwaters of the upper reaches of the Pi River, it was necessary to build a reinforced concrete arch dam here. The builders of the Fotzuling Reservoir are carrying out a great project to change nature here with creative labor. From the start of clearing the foundation in January 1952 to the summer of this year, in less than three years, China's first highest dam built of reinforced concrete, which is one li long and more than twenty-two zhang high, was born. It stands proudly in the Fotzuling Valley, conquering the wild Pi River and making it an assistant to the industrial and agricultural production of the Chinese people.

From the day the Fotzuling Reservoir was completed, the Pi River, which has always harmed the people, began to change its ferocious character. This summer, the Jianghuai area experienced a rainstorm that was rare in a century. As usual, the Pi River would have overflowed and caused disasters, drowning people and livestock, destroying houses, and swallowing up the crops that were about to ripen, causing huge disasters for the people. However, the completion of the reservoir completely changed the situation. In July, there were five rainstorms in a row, and each heavy rain pushed a large amount of water towards the reservoir with the force of thunder. In the most severe case on July 23, the amount of water flowing down per second exceeded 5,100 cubic meters, which is equivalent to ten trains of water per second. Even such a raging flood immediately lost its ferocious nature when it reached the reservoir, which can hold 500 million cubic meters of water, and accumulated into a beautiful lake, with calm waves that reflected the shadows of the green mountains on both banks. The huge arch dam stands at the end of the reservoir, becoming a pillar in the torrent. The bottom of the dam is equipped with huge闸门 (sluice gates), and the water in the reservoir obediently listens to the command of the managers, queuing out of the gates, at most not exceeding 500 cubic meters per second. This made the largest flood in the Pi River's hydrological record unable to show its power here. The people living along the Pi River all said happily: "In the past, if the Dabie Mountains had such a heavy rain as this year, we would have fled to the hills long ago. This year's flood is much more orderly, and even the soybeans and peanuts planted by the water's edge have not been flooded. The power of the arch dam is really great!" The people living along the Huai River also said: "The Fotzuling Reservoir was completed just before the arrival of the flood, blocking the flood of the Pi River. The reservoir is really our savior in times of emergency."

We have not only tamed the Pi River so that it no longer harms the people, but we will also further force it to work for the people. Before the water of the Pi River leaves the Fotzuling Reservoir, we will also make it spit out all the "energy" contained in the water and turn it into "electrical energy" to be sent to the countryside and factories. Now, the hydropower plant project of the Fotzuling Reservoir is in full swing, and the ferocious flood of the Pi River will be transformed into a productive expert. The engineers who conquered the flood are not willing to let the water that has released electrical energy flow into the sea in vain. They have already made blueprints to build weirs and open canals to divert water to irrigate more than 700,000 mu of farmland along the river that is often plagued by drought, ensuring two harvests every year. This irrigation canal, which is dozens of kilometers long, will also be used to transport civilian ships carrying 50 tons of cargo, strengthening the exchange of materials between the Pi River and the towns along the Huai River.

The completion of the Fotzuling Reservoir marks a new development in China's water conservancy engineering technology. This victory in the great struggle to change nature fully demonstrates the great power of the Party's leadership and the high wisdom of the people of New China. The arch dam is a technically complex structure, especially when it is built in the Dabie Mountains, which are prone to earthquakes. It is necessary to use advanced mechanics to calculate the magnitude of the force borne by each part in order to allocate enough steel and concrete to resist it. The builders of the Fotzuling Reservoir solved this complex and difficult design problem through careful research. They also created or used many machines and equipment that China had never used before, which not only made the project better, faster, and more economical, but also accumulated experience for other projects. The difficulties encountered in the construction are countless: when excavating the foundation, they encountered faults in the rock. The builders of the reservoir fully understood the organization of the strata by drilling the foundation universally, and then cleverly moved the axis of the dam and modified the slope of the dam surface, which not only avoided the faults, but also saved hundreds of billions of yuan worth of concrete. During the construction, they encountered unexpected floods, and the surrounding dam protecting the construction site was breached, causing the project to be completely suspended. They used the power of the masses to erase the traces of the flood and resume work in just a few days, and did the work faster than before. At the beginning of the Fotzuling project, there was no domestic experience, equipment, or skilled workers in injecting cement slurry into the stratum to increase impermeability. They created experience from scratch, invented grouting equipment, and trained a large number of grouting technicians. They not only successfully completed the task of building the Fotzuling Reservoir, but also were able to assist other reservoir projects and solve the extremely difficult grouting problem.

The advanced experience of the Soviet Union is also an indispensable factor for the completion of the Fotzuling Reservoir. In the construction, we adopted the energy dissipation equipment that the Soviet Union had recently successfully tested, which completely eliminated the destructive force of more than 200,000 horsepower contained in the water flow during the flood period within a short distance, calmed down the rapids below the gate, and prevented the downstream river channel from being scoured. In the concrete pouring work, we adopted the Soviet Union's advanced labeling, mixing, vibration, and maintenance methods, which increased the strength of the concrete and reduced the amount of cement used to below the standard cement usage, creating a new national record. The Soviet Union's advanced experience in using parallel flow operations for rapid construction helped our reservoir project progress even more. Due to the implementation of this experience, the completion of the reservoir project was advanced by nine months, catching up before the major flood occurred in the Huai River basin this year, reducing the loss of people's floods. Now, the builders of the Fotzuling Reservoir have completed their glorious mission and have moved their positions to another wild river in the Dabie Mountains. They will build a larger Meishan Reservoir arch dam in the upper reaches of the Shi River, creating happiness for more people.

From the construction of the Fotzuling Reservoir, I deeply realized that the people have infinite wisdom and power, but this wisdom and power can only be brought into full play under the leadership of the Communist Party. As a water conservancy engineer and a participant in the construction of the reservoir, I am deeply proud of the people of the new China who live in the era of Mao Zedong!

    佛子岭水库的建成
    全国人民代表大会代表
    佛子岭水库工程指挥部指挥  汪胡桢
    佛子岭水库已在今年八月里建成了。它是我国人民在共产党、人民政府的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，用自己的劳动建造起来的大型水利工程。这个水库的建成，标志着我国水利工程技术的新的进展。
    佛子岭水库位置在曾经是革命根据地的大别山区。为了根治淮河，拦阻淠河上游的洪水，需要在这里建筑一座钢筋混凝土连拱坝。佛子岭水库的建设者在这里以创造性的劳动，进行着改变自然的伟大工程。从一九五二年一月开始清基至今年夏季不到三年时间，一座长达一里、高逾二十二丈的我国第一座用钢筋混凝土建筑的最高水坝诞生了。它傲然耸立在佛子岭山谷，征服了野性的淠河，使它成为中国人民工农业生产的助手。
    从佛子岭水库建成的日子起，历来为害人民的淠河，开始改变了它凶猛的性格。今年夏季，江淮
  一带降着百年罕遇的暴雨，照例，淠河一定要泛滥成灾，漂溺人民和牲畜，冲毁房屋，吞噬即将成熟的庄稼，为人民造成巨大的灾患，但是水库的建成使情况完全改变了。七月份连下五次暴雨，每次大雨都以雷霆万钧之力把大量的水向水库推来。在七月二十三日最厉害的一次，每秒钟流下的水量超过五千一百立方公尺，等于每秒钟送来十列火车所载的水。即使这样汹涌的大水，一到了能容五亿立方公尺的水库里，就立刻失去其凶悍的本性，积聚成一个美丽的湖泊，波平如镜，能映见两岸青山的倒影。巨大的连拱坝屹立于水库的末端，成为中流的砥柱。坝底设有庞大的闸门，水库里的水又驯顺地听着管理人的指挥，从闸门里排队出去，最多时每秒钟不超过五百余立方公尺。使今年淠河的有水文纪录以来的最大洪水，奔流到这里也不能稍逞威风。住在淠河沿岸的人民都欢腾地说：“往年大别山要下像今年这么大的雨，我们早向山岗上去逃命了，今年的洪水规矩多了，连种在水边边的黄豆和落花生也没有淹着，连拱坝的力量真大！”住在淮河沿岸的人民也说：“佛子岭水库恰好在大水到来前完了工，挡住了淠河的洪水，水库真是我们急难中的大救星。”
    我们不但驯服了淠河使它不再为害人民，还要进一步强迫它为人民劳动。在淠河水离开佛子岭水库以前，我们还要使它把水里蕴藏的“能”全部吐出来，化成“电能”，送到农村和工厂里去。现在，佛子岭水库的水力发电厂工程，正在全面进行，凶恶的淠河洪水将一变而为生产的能手。征服了洪水的工程师们，还不肯让吐出了电能的水，白白地流到大海里去，他们已经制出蓝图，要建堰开渠，引水去灌溉沿河常闹旱灾的七十多万亩农田，保证每年有两次收获。这条长达数十公里的灌溉渠同时还要被利用来行驶载货五十吨的民船，加强淠河和沿淮各城镇间物资的交流。
    佛子岭水库的建成，标志着我国水利工程技术的新发展。这一改变自然的伟大斗争的胜利，充分表现出党的领导的雄伟力量和新中国人民的高度智慧。连拱坝是个技术性较高和较复杂的结构，尤其是建设在有地震的大别山区里，必须用高深的力学来计算出各部分所承受的力的大小，才可以配置足够的钢筋和混凝土去抵抗它。佛子岭水库的建设者们经过精密的研究，把这个复杂而困难的设计问题解决了。他们又创制或使用了许许多多我国从未使用过的机器和设备，不但使工程做得更好更快和更省，而且为其他工程积累了经验。施工中所遇到的困难是数不尽的：在开挖基础的时候，遇见了岩石里的断层。水库建设者们就把地基普遍钻探充分了解地层的组织情况后，巧妙地移动了坝的轴线，修改了坝面的坡度，不但避开了断层，而且节省了价值数百亿元的混凝土。在施工中途，遇到了出乎意料的洪水，保护建筑基地的围坝被冲开了，使工程完全停顿，他们就利用群众的力量在短短数天里，抹去了洪水的创痕，重新恢复工作，而且把工作做得比从前更快。佛子岭的工程开始时，国内还没有在地层里灌进水泥浆以增加不透水性的经验、设备和技术工人，他们就白手起家地创造了经验，发明了灌浆设备，培养出大批灌浆的技工。不但胜利地完成了建设佛子岭水库的任务，而且能够协助其他水库工程，解决了极度困难的灌浆问题。
    苏联的先进经验对于佛子岭水库的建成也是不可缺少的因素。施工中我们采用了苏联最近试验成功的消能设备，使洪水时期水流中所含的二十余万马力的破坏力，在短距离内全部消灭，使闸门以下的激流，顿时平静下来，并使下游的河槽不致遭到冲刷。在混凝土浇筑工作中，我们采用了苏联先进的标号、配合、震捣及养护方法，使得混凝土的强度增加而水泥的使用量减少到规定水泥用量标准以下，创造了全国的新纪录。苏联的用平行流水作业法来进行快速施工的先进经验对我们的水库工程进展帮助更大，由于推行这一经验，使水库工程的完成提前了九个月，赶到了今年淮河流域发生大洪水的前面，减轻了人民水灾的损失。现在，佛子岭水库的建设者们完成了光荣的任务，已经转移阵地向大别山区另一野性河流进军了。他们将兴建一座库容更大的位于史河上游的梅山水库连拱坝，为更多的人民创造幸福。
  　从佛子岭水库的建设中，使我深刻地体会到人民中间蕴藏着无穷的智慧和力量，但这些智慧和力量，也只有在共产党的领导下，才能得到这样高度的发挥。我以一个水利工程人员和水库建筑的参加者的亲身体会，深深为我们生活在毛泽东时代的新中国人民感到骄傲！
