    A New Type of Village
    Zhou Huizhi
    In late September, the Jinzhong Plain entered the tense season of autumn harvest and planting. In Zhangqing Village, Yuci County, located in the central part of the plain, the bell in the agricultural production cooperative rang loudly every day at daybreak. Then, teams of male and female farmers went to the fields to harvest the abundant crops. When the sun descended behind the Lüliang Mountains, the members yelled at the livestock and pulled carts loaded with grain back to the village, to the threshing grounds of each production team. Tractors from the agricultural machinery tractor station, emitting a "put-put" sound, pulled plows and seeders, plowing the autumn fields and sowing winter wheat for the agricultural production cooperative.

    With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the reform of agricultural technology, many rural areas have changed their poverty and backwardness, embarking on the road to prosperity. The production enthusiasm and collectivist thinking of farmers have also gradually grown. Zhangqing Village in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, is one of these new types of villages.

    Zhangqing Village began to organize a mutual aid team in 1950, and by 1952 it had grown to thirty-six. Due to the increase in mutual aid teams, the average yield per mu of land in the village also increased from more than 270 jin to more than 300 jin. Last spring, an agricultural production cooperative was organized. During the autumn harvest, the agricultural production cooperative demonstrated its superiority to the broad masses of farmers with an average yield of 418 jin per mu, 38 percent higher than that of individual farmers in the village. Each member received 20 jin and 12 liang of autumn grain for each labor day, and 65 jin for each shi of yield. Hou Youer, a middle peasant, and his family of eight received a total of more than 15,900 jin of grain, an increase of more than 3,000 jin compared to their income before joining the cooperative. Members with more land and fewer people, and those with more people and less land, also earned about 1,000 jin more than before joining the cooperative. Li Jiguang, an old man in his sixties who grew vegetables, had four mu of land and used to earn at most 2,100 jin of grain, but after joining the cooperative, he received 3,500 jin. Seeing these benefits with their own eyes, the farmers asked to join the cooperative one after another. In January of this year, the agricultural production cooperative expanded from the original 30 households to 187 households. After the summer harvest and the establishment of the tractor station, another 295 households applied to join the cooperative in June. The current "Shuguang" (Dawn) Agricultural Production Cooperative now has more than 90 percent of the village's households.

    The agricultural production cooperative has not only changed the economic life of the countryside, but also the mental outlook of the farmers. The participation of women in production in Zhangqing Village is a good illustration of this. Women in this area originally did not have the habit of working in the fields. After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, through continuous education and mobilization, the idea that women rely on men for clothing and food has gradually changed. This year, more than 90 women have worked in the fields, accounting for more than 60 percent of the total number of women with labor power. Many people have recorded four or five hundred work points before the autumn harvest. Zhou Yingcui, whom the villagers often praise, also began to participate in production last autumn. Because of her active labor and leading by example, and launching competitions between women and male members to strive for equal pay for equal work, she was voted a labor model and elected as a member of the cooperative's management committee and deputy leader of the third production team.

    In the winters of 1951 and 1953, Zhangqing Village also organized supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives respectively. After the establishment of the supply and marketing cooperative, it supplied a large number of production and living materials, supplying more than 30,000 chi of cotton cloth and more than 17 million yuan worth of production materials in the first half of this year alone. It promptly solved the urgent needs of the farmers, freeing them from the intermediate exploitation of private merchants. Since February this year, the credit cooperative has lent out a total of more than 45 million yuan, and has also acted as an agent for banks to issue loans for draft animals and fertilizers amounting to more than 50 million yuan, solving the difficulties of many farmers. Gao Fude, a poor man with seven children, lacked grain every year and had to borrow high-interest loans every year. In April of this year, his family was about to run out of food again. After learning about this situation, the cooperative lent him 150,000 yuan, bought 250 jin of sorghum and corn, and ate it until the summer harvest. During the same period, the credit cooperative also absorbed more than 48 million yuan in farmer deposits. Many farmers send their surplus grain sales and temporarily unused pocket money to the credit cooperative to deposit.

    In addition to increasing farmers' incomes and eliminating the exploitation of private merchants and usurers, these three types of cooperative economy cooperate with each other to better develop rural production and life. This summer, several cooperatives jointly held a meeting to study and improve the supply of agricultural tools in the village. Most of the agricultural tools used by farmers in Zhangqing Village are supplied by Zhao Huancheng, a local blacksmith. However, Zhao Blacksmith's capital is limited, and he can only buy some scrap iron, and the agricultural tools he makes are not very durable. In April, after joint research by the cooperatives, a combination contract was established: the credit cooperative lent the blacksmith 500,000 yuan, the supply and marketing cooperative introduced him to Taiyuan to buy good iron, and he made more than 400 pieces of agricultural tools according to the needs of the agricultural production cooperative, which were delivered to the supply and marketing cooperative for timely supply to farmers within three months. In this way, the quality of the agricultural tools made is good, and the price of each piece is 1,000 to 10,000 yuan cheaper than in the past. It also supported handicraft production.

    Plowing with tractors is something that farmers have long yearned for. When the state decided to establish a tractor station in Zhangqing Village in June of this year, the farmers immediately vacated their houses, paved the roads, and welcomed the tractors. Within two days of the tractors entering the village, 210 farmers applied to join the cooperative.

    During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit Yan Xishan and the Japanese invaders, the number of draft animals in Zhangqing Village gradually decreased, and the amount of wasteland increased day by day. In the years since liberation, although the number of draft animals has increased from more than 70 to more than 300, only more than 1,000 mu of the more than 4,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed, and the cultivation of the existing cultivated land is not meticulous enough. The lack of animal power among poor peasants has rarely been changed. The unreasonable phenomenon of exchanging one mu of land for cattle work with five people still existed in large numbers until last year. The arrival of tractors will relieve the farmers in this area from the difficulty of insufficient animal power for many years, and can free up a large number of laborers to process the land. During this summer's cultivation, the cooperative saved labor and planted 800 mu of late autumn crops, and hoed the autumn fields one more time. In the past, after hanging up the hoe, they were busy cultivating the land and could not take care of accumulating fertilizer. This year, the cooperative transferred 50 animal powers to the city to pull manure, and pulled a total of more than 3,000 buckets in three months. At the same time, it also accumulated 3,000 carts of compost. Using machine cultivation on the basis of collectivization will further tap the potential of the land and greatly increase the yield per unit area. Zhangqing Village plans to increase the yield of machine-sown wheat this year by 25 percent compared to last year.

    The new type of rural area also requires a corresponding level of science and technology. The Zhangqing Tractor Station has begun training tractor drivers, and the agricultural production cooperative has also trained some accountants, medical workers, and agricultural science and technology personnel. More than 20 graduates of higher primary schools in the village have also organized self-study groups. They are all nervously engaged in production and study at the same time to adapt to the needs of the new countryside.

    一个新型的村庄
    周慧之
    九月下旬，晋中平原进入了紧张的秋收秋种季节，位于平原中部的榆次县张庆村，每天天刚一亮，农业生产合作社里便当当地响起了钟声，接着，一队队的男女农民，就分头到地里去收割丰盛的庄稼。当太阳向吕梁山背后降落的时候，社员们又吆喝着牲口，把一辆辆满载谷物的大车拉回村中，拉到各个生产队的晒场上。农业机器拖拉机站的拖拉机，发出突突的叫声，牵引着犁耙和播种机，替农业生产合作社耕翻秋地和播种冬麦。
    随着互助合作运动的发展和农业技术的改革，很多农村都改变了贫困和落后的状况，走上富裕繁荣的道路，农民的生产积极性和集体主义思想也逐渐成长起来。山西榆次县的张庆村，就是这些新型村庄中的一个。
    张庆村在一九五零年开始组织了一个互助组，一九五二年发展到三十六个。由于互助组的增多，村内每亩土地的平均产量也从二百七十多斤提高到三百零几斤。去年春天组织了一个农业生产合作社，秋收时，农业生产合作社便以平均每亩产四百一十八斤、高于村内单干农民百分之三十八的成绩，向广大农民显示了它的优越性。社员每一劳动日分得秋粮二十斤十二两，每一石产量的土地分得六十五斤。中农侯有儿一家八口人，共分粮一万五千九百多斤，比入社前的收入增加三千多斤，地多人少和人多地少的社员，也都比入社前多收入千斤左右，六十多岁的种菜老汉李继光有四亩地，过去顶多收入两千一百多斤粮，入社后却分到了三千五百多斤。农民们亲眼看到这些好处，便纷纷要求入社。今年一月，农业生产合作社从原来的三十户扩大到
  一百八十七户。经过夏季丰收和建立拖拉机站的影响，六月间又有二百九十五户农民报名入社。现在的曙光农业生产合作社已拥有全村百分之九十以上的农户了。
    农业生产合作社不仅改变了农村的经济生活，也改变了农民的精神面貌，张庆村妇女的参加生产，就很好地说明了这个问题。这一带妇女本来没有下地劳动的习惯，农业生产合作社成立后，经过不断教育和发动，妇女们依靠男人穿衣吃饭的思想已逐渐改变，今年下地劳动的妇女已有九十多人，占有劳动力妇女总数的百分之六十多，很多人在秋收前已记了四、五百个劳动工分。像村里人经常称道的周英翠，也是去年秋天才开始参加生产的，由于她积极劳动，处处带头，并发动妇女和男社员展开竞赛，争取男女同工同酬，结果被大家评为劳动模范，并被选为农业生产合作社的社务委员和第三生产队的副队长。
    张庆村在一九五一年和一九五三年的冬天，还分别组织了供销合作社和信用合作社。供销合作社成立后，供应了大量的生产、生活用品，光今年上半年就供给村内三万多尺棉布和价值一千七百多万元的生产资料。及时解决了农民的迫切需要，使农民摆脱了私商的中间剥削。信用合作社自从今年二月到七月，共已贷出四千五百多万元，并代理银行发放耕畜肥料贷款五千多万元，解决了很多农民的困难。家有七个小孩的贫民高富德，年年缺粮，年年要借高利债款。今年四月，家中眼看又要断炊，社里了解了这一情况后，便贷给他十五万元，买了二百五十斤高粱和玉米，一直吃到夏收。在这同一期间，信用合作社还吸收农民存款四千八百多万元。很多农民把卖余粮和暂时不用的零钱，都送到信用合作社里存起来。
    这三种合作经济，除使农民增加收入、免除私商和高利贷者的剥削外，并互相配合，使农村的生产和生活更好地向前发展。今年夏季，几个合作社联合召开了会议，研究改进了村里的农具供应工作。张庆村农民使用的农具，大部分是本村铁匠赵焕成供给的，但是赵铁匠的本钱有限，只能收买一些烂铁，打出的农具很不耐用。四月间，合作社共同研究后，订立了一个结合合同：由信用合作社贷给铁匠五十万元，供销合作社介绍他到太原买了好铁，根据农业生产合作社的需要打了四百多件农具，交由供销合作社在三个月中按时供给农民使用。这样一来，打出的农具质量既好，每件的价钱又比过去便宜了一两千元到一万元左右。同时也扶助了手工业生产。
    拖拉机耕地是农民早就向往的事情。今年六月，国家决定在张庆村建立拖拉机站时，农民们立刻腾出了房子，铺平了道路，迎接拖拉机。拖拉机进村后的两天中，就有二百一十户农民报名要求入社。
    在国民党阎锡山匪帮和日寇统治时期，张庆村耕畜逐渐减少，荒地日益增多。解放几年来，耕畜虽已由七十多头增加到三百多头，但四千多亩荒地却只开垦了一千多亩，而且现有耕地的耕作也不够细致。贫农畜力缺乏的情况更是很少改变，五个人工换一亩地牛工的不合理现象，直到去年还大量存在。拖拉机到来后，将为这一带农民解除多年来畜力不足的困难，并可抽出大批劳力进行土地加工。今年夏耕中，社内就已节省出劳动力，种了八百亩晚秋，多锄了一次秋田。过去挂锄后，忙着耕地就顾不了积肥，今年社内抽出五十个畜力到城里拉粪，三个月中共拉了三千多桶。同时还积堆肥三千多车。在合作化的基础上使用机器耕地，将能更进一步发挥土地潜力，大大提高单位面积产量，张庆村今年机播的小麦，就计划比去年提高产量百分之二十五。
    新型的农村也要求有相适应的科学技术水平，张庆拖拉机站已开始了拖拉机手的训练工作，农业生产合作社也培养了一些会计、医务和农业科学技术人材。全村二十多个高小毕业生，还组织了自学小组。他们都在紧张地一面生产、一面学习，以适应新农村的需要。
