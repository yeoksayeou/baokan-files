    Overcome Pride and Do a Good Job in Safe Production

    Since the beginning of this year, accidents in some regions and some enterprises have been more serious than in previous years. Some enterprises and units that have been awarded the title of "Safety Model" and have received commendations or rewards have also had major accidents this year. The circumstances and specific causes of accidents in enterprises are very complex and vary, but one of the main common reasons is that the leaders of the enterprises have developed complacency, neglected the policy of safe production, and allowed things to drift in their daily production leadership, resulting in lax labor discipline and failure to effectively implement rules and regulations in the enterprises. The frequent accidents in the Central Shaft of the Xi'an Coal Mine in Liaoyuan City is a clear example.

    The construction of the Central Shaft of the Xi'an Coal Mine once had remarkable achievements and was commended and rewarded by the higher authorities. However, some leaders of the construction company, such as Ma Jie, became proud of this: he refused to attend the meeting convened by the Mining Bureau to implement the operating procedures; he also felt that the operating procedures promulgated by the Central Fuel Industry Department were not applicable; he ignored the reasonable suggestions of the workers and masses; and he did not seriously implement the suggestions of the experts. Under their influence, the person designing the hanging platform could disregard safety regulations, not submit formal drawings, and start construction without formal review and approval; some cadres blindly pursued progress, violated operating procedures, and encouraged workers to take risks in their operations; some workers did not comply with operating procedures and arbitrarily violated labor discipline. As a result, serious accidents occurred one after another.

    According to incomplete statistics from the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry: state-owned coal mines had a total of 160 major accidents from January to August, resulting in 164 deaths; from January to August, there were 9,570 mechanical and electrical accidents, resulting in a loss of more than 200,000 tons of raw coal. Other political and economic losses cannot be calculated.

    It can be seen from this that major accidents or frequent accidents in enterprises not only affect the overall completion of the national plan and cause huge losses to the state's property, but also cause some employees to lose their lives or damage their health.

    The leaders and all employees of enterprises should fully realize that with the rapid development of national construction and production, the various problems in enterprises, especially technical problems, are becoming more and more complex. Anyone who is arrogant and complacent and neglects labor discipline will bring disasters to the enterprise. Only by treating work with humility and prudence, resolutely implementing the instructions of the Party and the higher-level administration, fully relying on the collective wisdom and strength, and striving to study production operations, especially by seriously learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and constantly improving the management level of enterprises, can we keep up with the needs of production and construction. At the same time, we must strengthen the technical leadership of enterprises, establish and implement practical rules and regulations, continuously consolidate the labor discipline of enterprises, implement the policy of safe production, and work to reduce and eliminate accidents, in order to comprehensively complete the national plan.

### 克服骄傲情绪，做好安全生产

    克服骄傲情绪，做好安全生产
    今年以来，有些地区和有些企业的事故比往年严重。有些得过“安全模范”称号、受过表扬或奖励的企业单位，今年也发生了重大事故。企业中发生事故的情形和具体原因是很复杂的，也是各有不同的，但共同的主要原因之一，就是企业的领导者滋长了骄傲自满情绪，忽视安全生产的方针，在日常的生产领导中放任自流，以致企业中的劳动纪律松懈，规程制度不能切实贯彻。辽源市西安煤矿中央竖井事故丛生的情形就是一个明显的例证。
    西安煤矿中央竖井的建井工作，曾经有过显著成绩而受到上级的表扬和奖励。但建井公司的某些领导者如马竭等，却因此骄傲起来了：矿务局召开贯彻作业规程的会议他拒绝出席；中央燃料工业部颁布的操作规程他也认为用不上；对于职工群众的合理建议置之不理；对于专家的建议也不认真贯彻执行。在他们的影响下，设计吊盘的人可以不考虑保安规程，不交正式图纸，不经正式的审查批准就施工；若干干部盲目追求进度，违反操作规程，并鼓励工人冒险进行作业；有些工人不遵守操作规程，任意破坏劳动纪律。于是，严重事故就相继发生了。
    据燃料工业部煤矿管理总局不完全的统计：国营煤矿一至八月份共发生重大事故一百六十次，死亡一百六十四人；一至八月份发生机电事故九千五百七十次，因而少产原煤二十万吨以上。其他政治上经济上的损失还无法计算。
    由此可见，企业中发生了重大事故或者事故频繁，不仅影响着国家计划的全面完成，不仅使国家的资财遭受巨大损失，而且使若干职工丧失了生命或者损害了身体健康。
    企业的领导者和全体职工都应该充分认识：随着国家建设和生产的迅速发展，企业中的各种问题特别是技术问题是愈来愈复杂的，谁如果骄傲自满和忽视劳动纪律，那就要给企业带来奇灾大祸。大家只有虚心谨慎地对待工作，坚决执行党和上级行政的指示，充分依靠集体的智慧和力量，努力钻研生产业务，特别是要认真学习苏联的先进经验，不断地提高企业的管理水平，才有可能赶上生产和建设的需要。同时，必须加强企业的技术领导工作，建立和贯彻切合实际的规程制度，不断地巩固企业的劳动纪律，贯彻安全生产的方针，作到减少事故和消灭事故，才能全面地完成国家计划。
