    Advanced Soviet Postal and Telecommunications Services
    ——Introducing Postal and Telecommunications Exhibits at the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction
    Ma Ran

    In the northern part of the eastern hall of the Soviet Exhibition Hall are displayed some exhibits related to transportation, and in the southern part are displayed machines and instruments related to telecommunications, electrical engineering, and broadcasting. On the western wall hang giant pictures of buildings such as the Moscow Central Telegraph Office and the Moscow Post Office Hall, each about four meters high and five meters wide. In addition, there are several pictures of postal and telecommunications workplaces. From these pictures, one can see that the process of sorting and delivering mail at the Moscow Post Office has been automated. Various mails are carried by automatic transfer machines to their designated locations, then packed into mailbags, and sent to various places by various means of transportation. The spacious and bright telegraph hall of the Central Telegraph Office is equipped with various modern telegraph machines. The workers operate skillfully and can maximize their speed and efficiency, sending a large number of telegrams to the whole country and the world. In the telegraph room, telegrams are transmitted by pneumatic machines, which can send telegrams from one floor to another.

    Various telecommunications, broadcasting machines, and telecommunications and electrical measuring instruments are also displayed here. Although the quantity is not very large, they have all reached a very high technical level, prominently showing the characteristics of Soviet postal and telecommunications serving the needs of production and the material and cultural life of the people. Among the exhibits, the radio telephone transceiver, using two crystal-controlled frequency activities, is a two-way intercom radio telephone, suitable for collective farms, pastures, forest areas, etc. The mine telephone is based on the principle of an ordinary magneto telephone, but its shell is extremely strong and has strict sealing performance, which can avoid gas explosions caused by sparks inside the telephone. It can also resist thick humidity and huge vibrations, ensuring smooth communication in mining production, and more importantly, ensuring production safety. The fully relay-type automatic telephone exchange can connect twenty to forty users, and the power supply uses a sixty-volt battery. This equipment is extremely simple to use and maintain, and is suitable for internal use in factories, farms, and institutions. The dispatching switchboard for production scheduling and communication in large enterprises includes a set of amplifier equipment, an electric horn, and an electric microphone. It can connect sixty direct users, four relay lines to the city telephone exchange outside the factory, two directly to the factory director and chief engineer, and one external line to the radio broadcasting station. It can not only connect sixty households at the same time to discuss problems on the phone, but also talk to any one or several households at will, can also talk to people outside the factory, and can also use it to listen to the radio. The director's telephone and the secretary's telephone in the exhibits can be used to direct production. The director's telephone has six buttons and six pairs of lines connected to a common battery or automatic exchange. The director can flexibly connect several simultaneous incoming calls with the secretary's machine: he can freely talk to whichever one first, retain whichever one; the director talks to one, and the secretary talks to another.

    The telecommunications and electrical measuring instruments in the exhibits have reached an extremely high degree of precision. There is a universal eight-line oscilloscope that can be used to simultaneously record eight electrical waves on a 35mm film. The film speed can be adjusted to twelve types. After the recording is completed, like a movie copy, the shape of the eight electrical waves can be clearly displayed after development. There are also instruments that automatically record power, voltage, and current. When the power supply to be measured is connected, the paper on this instrument moves automatically, which can achieve the purpose of measurement and recording. There are AC and DC meters for measuring current. The DC bridge for measuring DC resistance is astonishingly precise. It can measure from one millionth of an ohm to one million ohms, and the accuracy differs by only five ten-thousandths. The accuracy of the other two standard resistance coils also differs by only one hundred thousandth to one ten-thousandth. We can also see several ammeters without pointers, which is very new to us. How can we indicate the reading without needles? It turns out that there are light-emitting and reflecting devices inside the meter. The angle of light reflection varies depending on the strength of the current passing through, and a light column or a needle-shaped black shadow is used to indicate the reading. This type of meter is very sensitive and can make the measurement accurate.

    These exhibits have aroused great attention from postal, telecommunications, and electrical workers. Some feel that seeing it once is not enough and want to see it a second time. After the visit, not only has knowledge increased, but also the confidence in learning from the Soviet Union and carrying out socialist construction has been strengthened. Everyone feels regret that Beijing does not yet have television broadcasting equipment. The television tuner here and the television in the cultural center cannot perform. However, many postal and telecommunications workers say with confidence that with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union to China in economy and technology, we must strive to carry out socialist construction, and we will surely have television equipment in the future. At that time, people in Beijing, like those in Moscow, will be able to sit in their homes and watch dramas.

    先进的苏联邮电通信事业
    ——介绍苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上的邮电展品
    马然
    在苏联展览馆东面小厅的北边陈列着交通运输方面的一部分展品，南边陈列着电信、电气和广播等方面的机器和仪器。西边的墙壁上悬挂着莫斯科中央电报局大楼和莫斯科邮政局大厅等建筑的巨型图片，这两幅图片高约四公尺，宽五公尺。另外，还有几幅邮政和电信工作间的图片。人们可以从这些图片上看出：莫斯科邮政局分拣、传递邮件的过程已经自动化了，各种邮件被自动传递机带到它应到的地点，然后被装进邮袋，再用各种运输工具把它送到各地去。中央电报局大楼宽敞明亮的报房大厅，装设着各种近代化的电报机械；工人们操作灵便，可以发挥最大的速度和效率，和全国、全世界大量地通电报。在报房里是用气压机传递电报的，它可以把电报从这一层楼送到另一层楼。
    这里还陈列着各种电信、广播机器和电讯、电气的测量仪器。数量虽然不太多，但都达到了很高的技术水平，突出地表现了苏联邮电通信为生产、为人民物质文化生活需要服务的特征。展品中的无线电话收发机，用两种晶体控制的频率活动，是单双向对讲无线电话，适用于集体农庄、牧场、林区等。矿井电话机在原理上是普通的磁石电话机，但它的外壳极为坚固，具有严密的封闭性能，可以避免因电话机内有火花而引起瓦斯爆炸的现象，它更可以抵抗浓厚的湿气和巨大的震动，保证在采矿生产中顺畅地通话，更重要的还是保证生产安全。全继电器式自动电话交换机，可以接二十到四十个用户，电源用的是六十伏特的蓄电池。这种设备使用和维护起来极为简单，适用于工厂、农场、机关内部。供大企业内生产调度和联系用的调度交换台，包括一套扩大器设备，一个电动式喇叭和一个电动式麦克风，可以接六十个直接用户，四条中继线接到厂外市内电话交换机，两条直接接通厂长和总工程师，一条外线通无线电广播站。它不但可以同时接通六十户，在电话上谈问题，也可以随意和任何一户或几户通话，也可以和厂外通话，还可以用它来收听广播。展品中的厂长用电话机和秘书用电话机，可以用来指挥生产。厂长用的电话机上，有六个按钮、六对线接到共电式或自动式的交换机。厂长可以和秘书机动地接几个同时打来的电话：可以随意先讲那一个，保留那一个；厂长自己讲那一个，秘书讲那一个。
    展品中电讯和电气测量仪器更达到了极高的精密程度。有一种万能八线示波器，可以用来在三十五公厘的胶片上同时记录八个电波，软片速度可调节成十二种，记录完毕后像电影拷贝一样，经过冲洗就可以清楚地显示出八个电波的形状。还有自动记录电力、电压和电流的仪器，当接通了所要测量的电源以后，这个仪器上的图纸自动移动，就可以达到测量记录的目的。测量电流的表有交流和直流两种。供测量直流电阻用的直流电桥，其精密度达到惊人的程度，它可以测量百万分之一欧姆到一百万欧姆，而准确度上下只相差万分之五。另外两个标准电阻线圈的准确度也只上下相差十万分之一到万分之一。我们还可以看到有几个没有指针的电流表，这对我们是非常新鲜的，没有针怎样来指示度数呢？原来在表里面有发光和反光设备，由于通过的电流强弱不同而使光的反射角度不同，用光柱或一个针尖形的黑影来指示度数。这种类型的表非常灵敏，可以使测量准确。
    这些展品引起了邮电和电气职工的极大注意，有的看一次嫌不够，还要看第二次。经过参观不但增长了知识，更加强了向苏联学习和进行社会主义建设的信心。大家感到遗憾的是北京还没有电视广播设备，在这里的电视机调整器和文化馆里的电视机都不能表演一番。但是，很多邮电职工都满怀信心地说，在苏联对中国经济上和技术上友谊的援助下，我们一定要努力进行社会主义建设，将来我们也一定会有电视设备的。那时候，北京的人将和莫斯科一样，可以坐在各人的家里看戏了。
