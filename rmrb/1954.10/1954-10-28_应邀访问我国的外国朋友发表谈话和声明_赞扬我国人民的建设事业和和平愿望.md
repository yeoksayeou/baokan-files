Foreign Friends Invited to Visit Our Country Make Speeches and Statements
Praising Our People's Construction and Peaceful Aspirations

    Japanese Diet Member Delegation
    The Japanese Diet Member Delegation returned to Tokyo on the 26th and issued a joint statement.
    The statement said: Through this visit, our Diet Member Delegation has realized that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, are building a new country and earnestly hope to establish friendly relations with our country for the sake of world peace.
    The statement emphasized: Our wish is to promote friendship between China and Japan, restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible, and resolve various outstanding issues between the two countries for the peace of Asia and the world.

    Head of the Indian Trade Union Congress Friendship Delegation
    The Indian National Trade Union Congress Friendship Delegation, invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to visit our country, led by the head of the delegation, K.P. Tripathi, General Secretary of the Indian National Trade Union Congress, arrived in Guangzhou on the 24th and left Guangzhou via Hong Kong on the 25th to return home.
    Before his departure, Tripathi delivered a radio speech on his visit to China at the Guangzhou People's Broadcasting Station. In his speech, he said: "India and China, these two large countries that are not only in Asia but also in the whole world have several common points, and the friendship between these two large countries began in the early days of history.
    "The peoples of India and China are peace-loving by nature. The recent awakening of Asian countries has made it impossible for Western countries to despise Asia as they did in the past. Our two great countries have formulated a plan for coexistence through the important meetings held by our Prime Ministers.
    "If this plan can be resolutely implemented, it may eliminate suspicion and fear in the world and bring peace to the world.
    "I think the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (which is a communist organization) inviting us (a non-communist organization) to visit China is implementing this policy."
    Tripathi then added: "The trust and hospitality given to us during our short visit, allowing us to visit anywhere we wanted to in China, has taken this policy of coexistence one step further."
    Tripathi concluded: "On behalf of my companions and myself, I would like to thank the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for giving us this opportunity."

    Members of the Indonesian Delegation to China
    According to reports from Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" on the 26th, fourteen members of the Indonesian Delegation to China and the Indonesian Women's Delegation met with the Hong Kong press on the 23rd when they passed through Hong Kong on their way home.
    Soegi Djokrosoemarto of the Indonesian Delegation to China said in a speech: "The Chinese people and their leaders sincerely desire peace." He also said: "The Chinese people's great construction undertakings have achieved success in every aspect."
    Bachder Djohan, President of the Indonesian Red Cross, who was also part of the Indonesian Delegation to China, said: "The Chinese people live happily under the current system, and a sense of satisfaction can be detected everywhere." He also said that the Chinese people attach great importance to physical health and that public health work has been very successful.

    Italian Women's Delegation
    The Italian Women's Delegation, invited by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to participate in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, left Beijing on the 26th to return home.
    During their stay in China, the delegation visited Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places.
    Before returning home, the delegation jointly sent a letter to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, first expressing their gratitude for the unforgettable visit during their stay in China. The letter then described the construction achievements in various aspects that they had witnessed in China. The letter also said: "Dear friends, we have learned a lot from you; we feel that the only possible and best way to express our gratitude for this extraordinary trip is to talk to our friends—Italian women—about you, about your work. We want to let Italy know the great achievements of your country, we want to use the strength of all our democratic organizations to support China's complete rights, support the liberation of Taiwan and the participation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, support your establishment of political, economic and cultural relations with all countries in the world, and at the same time condemn the interventionist policies of the imperialists, and support the unity and independence of Asian nations. China is a shining beacon in this regard, it shines with the victory over the colonial exploiters and their allies."
    The letter is full of deep friendship for the women of our country; and is willing to make such efforts to develop this friendship: "On our part, we want to work for such a future: creating increasingly close political, economic, trade and cultural relations between Italy and China. In this way, we may meet more often and work together for the same purpose."

    应邀访问我国的外国朋友发表谈话和声明
    赞扬我国人民的建设事业和和平愿望
    日本国会议员访华团
    日本国会议员访华团，已在二十六日回到东京，并发表了联合声明。
    声明说：我们国会议员访华代表团通过这次访问，已经认识到，中国人民在毛泽东主席领导下，正在建设新国家，并为了世界和平，热烈地希望和我国建立友好关系。
    声明着重说：我们的愿望是，为了亚洲和世界的和平，要促进中日两国的友好，早日恢复邦交，解决两国间各种悬而未决的问题。
    印度工会大会友好代表团团长
    应中华全国总工会邀请来我国访问的印度全国工会大会友好代表团，由团长、印度全国工会大会总书记克·普·特里帕蒂率领，一行三人于二十四日抵达广州，二十五日离广州取道香港回国。
    行前，特里帕蒂曾在广州市人民广播电台发表访华广播演说，演说里说：“印度和中国，这两个不仅是亚洲而且是全世界范围内的大国有若干共同点，而且这两个大国间的友谊是早在历史初期就开始了的。
    “印度和中国人民天性是爱好和平的。亚洲国家最近的醒觉已经使得西方国家不可能再像它们过去一样轻视亚洲了。我们两个伟大国家通过我们的总理所举行的重要会议拟定了一个共处的方案。
    “如果能够坚决执行这种方案，那就可能使世界消除猜忌和恐惧，并为世界带来和平。
    “我认为中华全国总工会（它是一个共产主义组织）邀请我们（一个非共产主义组织）来中国访问就是执行的这种政策。”
    特里帕蒂接着又说：“在我们的短时访问中给予我们的信任和招待，让我们到全中国我们所要到的任何地方去访问，这就使这种共处政策更前进了一步。”
    特里帕蒂最后说：“我谨代表我的同伴和我自己对邀请我们的中华全国总工会给予我们的机会，表示感谢。”
    印度尼西亚访华代表团团员
    据香港“大公报”和“文汇报”二十六日报道：印度尼西亚访华代表团和印度尼西亚妇女代表团团员十四人，在二十三日路过香港回国时曾会见了香港报界。

    印度尼西亚访华代表团中的印度尼西亚红十字会会长巴赫德尔·约翰说：“中国人民在现制度下生活得很愉快，到处都可以觉察到一种满意的情绪。”他并说，中国人民都很重视身体健康，公共卫生工作做得很有成绩。
    意大利妇女代表团
    应中华全国民主妇女联合会邀请来我国参加建国五周年国庆典礼的意大利妇女代表团一行五人在二十六日离开北京回国。
    代表团在中国期间曾去沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、南京、上海、杭州等地参观。
    代表团在回国前夕曾联名致函中华全国民主妇女联合会，首先表示感谢在中国期间难忘的访问。信里接着叙述了她们在中国所接触到的各方面的建设成就。信中并说：“亲爱的朋友，我们向你们学习了很多东西；我们觉得向你们表示我们对这次不平凡的旅行的感谢，唯一可能的最好的方法就是跟我们的朋友——意大利妇女谈你们、谈你们的工作。我们要让意大利了解你们国家的伟大成就，我们要用我们一切民主组织的力量来支持中国的完整权利、支持解放台湾和让中华人民共和国参加联合国，支持你们建立和世界上一切国家的政治、经济和文化的关系，同时谴责帝国主义者的干涉政策，支持亚洲各民族的统一与独立，中国在这方面是一个光辉的灯塔，它闪耀着战胜了殖民剥削者和他们的联盟者的胜利之光。”
    信里充满着对我国妇女深厚的友谊；并愿为发展这种友谊将作这样的努力：“在我们这方面，我们要为这样一个前途进行工作：创造意大利和中国之间的日益紧密的、政治、经济、贸易和文化的关系。这样，我们就可能更经常的相见，一起为同样的目的而工作。”
