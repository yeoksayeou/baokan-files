Remarkable achievements have been made in medical and health work in the disaster areas of Hubei Province. From the beginning of flood prevention in June to the present, a total of more than 10,000 Chinese and Western medical personnel have been mobilized to work in flood prevention and disaster relief across the province. The value of medicines and equipment issued by the Provincial Department of Health has reached 20 billion yuan. Thanks to the hard work of all medical staff, no virulent infectious diseases have occurred in the disaster areas of the province. Although general infectious diseases such as dysentery, malaria, and colds have occurred in some areas, the incidence rate has also dropped rapidly after the widespread health and epidemic prevention campaign launched in September, combined with intensive treatment.

Through the tempering of this flood prevention struggle, many outstanding medical workers have emerged from medical stations in various places, who are not afraid of hardship and are enthusiastic about serving the victims. He Xiulun, a doctor from Jianli County, once treated a child of a disaster victim named Liu Zhonggao. The child's throat was blocked by phlegm, and he was about to suffocate. In the absence of equipment, He Xiulun used his own mouth to suck out the phlegm from the child's mouth, saving the child's life. Zhang Minghe, the leader of the medical team who went to Qianjiang County to treat the victims, sometimes carried medicine himself and went to see patients dozens of miles away late at night. When performing surgery, without electric lights or gasoline lamps, he used kerosene lamps instead and still cured the patients.

Traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine have also played a role in medical and health work in disaster areas. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the disaster areas have participated in local free medical and health work. Xie Kunshan, a 71-year-old traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Echeng County, worked tirelessly to treat the victims. During flood prevention and rescue, some workers had wounds on their legs and feet. If bandages were used, they would easily get wet and be ineffective. Traditional Chinese medicine plasters solved this difficulty. Many simple Chinese medicine prescriptions for treating snake bites, eczema, dysentery, etc., were also very effective. Acupuncture therapy was also used in many places. The health departments of eight counties have newly established Chinese medicine departments. In the medical and health work of flood prevention and disaster relief, the expenditure on Chinese medicine reached several billion yuan.

Thanks to the hard work of medical workers in various places, the relationship between the Party and the victims has become closer. The victims affectionately said: "These are the doctors sent by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Many victims said that they must do a good job in production and disaster relief.

Now, with the return of the victims to their hometowns, health and epidemic prevention committees have been established at the district and township levels in various places. The Hubei Provincial People's Government Health Department held a health work conference in mid-October to further implement the principle of "prevention first," and required that the medical and health work in the disaster areas be done well to lay the foundation for future rural health work.

    湖北省灾区医疗卫生工作取得显著成绩
    湖北省灾区医疗卫生工作已取得显著成绩。自六月份防汛开始到目前为止，全省陆续动员到防汛、救灾工作岗位的中、西医务人员共有一万多名。由省卫生厅发出的医药、器材的价值，共达二百亿元。由于全体医务工作者艰苦努力，全省灾区没有发生过烈性传染病。一般性的传染病如痢疾、疟疾、感冒等虽在部分地区发生过，但经过九月份普遍展开的卫生防疫运动，结合突击治疗，发病率也迅速下降。
    经过这次防汛斗争的锻炼，各地医疗站涌现了许多不避艰苦、热心为灾民服务的优秀的医务工作者。监利县医生何修伦有一次替一个灾民的孩子刘忠高看病时，这个小孩痰液阻塞了喉咙，眼看快要窒息死，何修伦在缺乏设备的情况下，就用自己的嘴对着小孩的嘴，把痰吸出来，拯救了这个孩子的性命。到潜江县为灾民治病的医疗队队长张明和有时自己挑药，深夜到几十里以外的地方去看病。动手术时，没有电灯和汽灯，他就用煤油灯代替，同样治好了病人。
    中医和中药在灾区医疗卫生工作中也发挥了作用。灾区的中医都参加了当地免费的医疗卫生工作。鄂城县七十一岁的老中医谢昆山，不辞辛苦地为灾民看病。在防汛抢险中，有的民工腿和脚上有破伤，如用绷带包扎，易为水浸湿，不起作用，中医的膏药解决了这个困难。许多治蛇咬、湿症、痢疾等简易的中药处方，也非常有效。很多地方还运用了针灸疗法。有八个县的卫生部门新成立了中药部。在防汛、救灾的医疗卫生工作中，中药用款达数十亿元。
    由于各地医务工作者艰苦努力，使党和灾民的关系更为密切。灾民们亲切地说：“这是共产党和毛主席派来的医生”，许多灾民表示：一定要搞好生产救灾。
    现在，随着灾民还乡，各地都在区、乡一级建立了卫生防疫委员会的组织。湖北省人民政府卫生厅在十月中旬召开了卫生工作会议，进一步贯彻
  “预防为主”的方针，要求通过做好灾区的医疗卫生工作，为今后农村卫生工作打下基础。
