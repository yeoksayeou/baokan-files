Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: U.S. Pacific Forces are preparing to send representatives to be permanently stationed in Taiwan to jointly plot with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to strengthen military deployments and obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. According to reports, the U.S. Pacific Command will soon dispatch four naval officers, headed by a colonel, to be stationed in Taiwan, and will establish an agency in Taiwan before the end of the year. The U.S. Thirteenth Air Force stationed in the Philippines will also send representatives to Taiwan in the near future. According to reports, the U.S. Seventh Fleet, entrenched in the Taiwan Strait, has already dispatched two lieutenant colonels to be permanently stationed in Taiwan last week.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Director of the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration, Stassen, officially announced on the 6th that the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration will establish a branch office in Tokyo. This branch office will be headed by Meyer, who recently conducted an investigation in Japan on behalf of the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration.

The purpose of the United States in establishing such an agency in Japan is to strengthen Japan's economic militarization through "aid." Stassen said that the task of this branch office is mainly to be responsible for allocating funds from Japan's purchase of surplus U.S. agricultural products. United Press International quoted officials from the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration on the 6th as saying that the funds from Japan's purchase of surplus U.S. agricultural products "will be (by the United States) used for overseas procurement in Japan to supply other countries receiving U.S. mutual security assistance," and "will also be used to help Japan rebuild a certain amount of defense production." In fact, the supplementary agreement to the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" already stipulates that Japan's payment of $50 million for "aid" wheat should be entirely used to expand Japan's military industry. In addition, Japanese Finance Minister Sankuro Ogasawara is currently in the United States negotiating with the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration on the issue of Japan purchasing U.S. surplus agricultural products worth a total of $400 million over the next three years in the name of economic "aid."

    美国驻太平洋地区部队准备派遣代表常驻台湾
    美国将在日本设立“援外”分署
    【新华社八日讯】美国驻太平洋地区部队将派遣代表常驻台湾，和蒋介石卖国集团共同策划加强军事部署，阻挠中国人民解放台湾。有消息说，美国太平洋司令部将在最近派遣以一名上校为首的四名海军军官驻在台湾，并将在年底以前在台湾设立一个机构。驻菲律宾的美国第十三航空队也将在不久以后派遣代表到台湾去。据消息透露，盘踞台湾海峡的美国第七舰队已在上星期派遣两名中校级军官常驻台湾。
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生六日正式宣布，美国援外事务管理署将在东京设立分署。这个分署将由前不久曾代表美国援外事务管理署到日本进行过调查的麦耶为负责人。
    美国要在日本设立这样一个机构的目的，是想通过“援助”加强日本经济军事化。史塔生说，这个分署的任务主要是负责支配日本购买美国剩余农产品的价款。合众社六日引美国援外事务管理署官员的谈话说明：日本购买美国剩余农产品的价款，
  “将被（美国）用于在日本的海外采购，以供给其他接受美国共同安全援助的国家”，并且，“也用来帮助日本重建一定数量的防御生产”。事实上，美日“共同防御援助协定”的附属协定已经规定，日本支付五千万美元“援助”小麦的价款要全部用来扩大日本军事工业。除此以外，日本藏相小笠原三九郎现在正在美国和美国援外事务管理署谈判日本在今后三年内购买价值共达四亿美元的美国剩余农产品等经济“援助”问题。
