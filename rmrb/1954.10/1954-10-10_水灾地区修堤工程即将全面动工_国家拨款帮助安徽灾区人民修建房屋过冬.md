    Flood-stricken Areas to Fully Commence Dike Repair Projects
    State Allocates Funds to Help People in Anhui Disaster Areas Build Houses for Winter
      [Report from this newspaper] The repair projects for river embankments in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Hebei, and other regions will fully commence by the end of October.

    Since the beginning of summer this year, the Jianghuai region has experienced exceptionally heavy rainfall. In the Yangtze River basin, the average rainfall at fourteen stations from April to July was over 1,370 millimeters, exceeding the average annual rainfall in the past by more than 100 millimeters. Consequently, the water levels of various rivers exceeded historical highs, and the main and branch embankments were widely eroded. In Hubei Province, over 2,000 kilometers of the Jianghan main dike had more than 11,000 instances of slope slippage, leaks, and depressions. Now that the water levels of the rivers have receded, in order to seize the opportunity of the winter and spring slack farming season to repair the dikes in various areas that have been eroded by floods, the relevant departments of the State Council, based on the repair plans of various regions, have approved a batch of dike repair funds for Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, the Huai River area, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, and other places. The plan is to repair the dikes in the aforementioned areas before the spring plowing next year, and it is required that key dikes such as the Jingjiang Dike and the Wuwei Dike be guaranteed against breaches under this year's flood conditions. The remaining dikes are required to be restored to their pre-flood condition of this year.

    The dike repair project will require the mobilization of five to six million civilian laborers, working for more than three months. All dike repair funds will be used as payment for labor, which will greatly support the reconstruction of homes and the restoration of production for farmers in the disaster areas.

    Currently, the above-mentioned regions are carrying out surveying, measuring, and other preparations in full swing, and work can be fully commenced in late October.
   [Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th] The state is allocating funds to rebuild approximately 800,000 houses to help the people in the flood-stricken areas of Anhui Province spend the winter. At present, the first batch of housing reconstruction subsidies of 33.6 billion yuan allocated by the state has been successively distributed, and the second batch of subsidies of 48.4 billion yuan will also be issued soon. At the same time, the Anhui Provincial People's Bank has also begun to issue 100 billion yuan in living loans for the fourth quarter of this year, and residents in the disaster areas will draw a considerable portion from these loans to build houses. Materials for building houses, such as wood, bamboo, and reed mats, are being transferred and supplied by state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives. Branches of the state-owned native produce company are transporting and supplying 158,000 mao bamboo poles and 66,000 reed mats purchased from Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces. The 40,000 cubic meters of wood supplied by the state-owned Anhui Provincial Timber Company have been continuously transported to the disaster areas. With the strong assistance of the state, residents in the disaster areas have begun to build new houses.

    水灾地区修堤工程即将全面动工
    国家拨款帮助安徽灾区人民修建房屋过冬
      【本报讯】湖南、湖北、安徽、河北等地江河堤防的修复工程，十月底将全面开工。
    今年入夏以后，江淮地区雨量特大，长江流域在四月到七月的四个月中，十四个站平均降雨量一千三百七十多公厘，比过去一年平均总降雨量还多一百公厘。因而各江河都超过历年最高水位，干支堤防普遍受到冲刷。湖北省两千多公里的江汉干堤，就有脱坡、漏洞、跌窝一万一千多处。现在各江河都已退水，为了抓紧冬春农闲季节，修复各地遭受洪水冲刷的堤防，国务院有关部门根据各地修复计划，已核发湖南、湖北、安徽、淮河、江西、江苏、浙江、河北等地一批复堤经费，计划在明年春耕前把上述各地堤防修复，并要求重点堤防如荆江大堤、无为大堤，要保证在今年洪水情况下不发生溃决，其余堤防要求恢复今年汛前原状。
    复堤工程共需动员民工五、六百万人，作工三个月以上，复堤经费全部以工代赈，这对灾区农民重建家园和恢复生产，将起很大支持作用。
    现在，上述各地正在紧张进行勘察、测量和其他准备工作，十月下旬就可全面动工。
   【新华社合肥九日电】国家拨款重建约八十万间房屋，帮助安徽省水灾区人民过冬。现在，由国家拨出的三百三十六亿元的房屋重建补助费已陆续发放，第二批补助费四百八十四亿元也即将发下。同时，安徽省人民银行也开始发放今年第四季度的一千亿元生活贷款，灾区居民将从这些贷款中抽出相当部分来修筑房屋。修筑房屋用的木材、竹子、芦席等材料，正由国营商业部门和供销合作社调运供应。国营土产公司的分支机构从江西、江苏和山东等省采购的十五万八千根毛竹和六万六千条芦席正陆续调运、供应。由国营安徽省木材公司供应的四万立方公尺木材，已源源运到灾区。灾区居民在国家有力的帮助下，已开始修盖新屋。
