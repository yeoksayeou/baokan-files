Ceramics from Jingdezhen are known not only for their excellent quality but also for their beautiful ceramic art.

For nearly a century, under the relentless destruction of the reactionary ruling class, ceramic art was in a state of near collapse. In those dark days, ceramic artists not only faced constant threats of unemployment, poverty, and hunger but were also continuously exploited and persecuted by layers of bureaucrats and warlords. Before liberation, the Kuomintang bureaucrat Feng Jingfu forced the then-famous porcelain painter Wang Dachang to paint porcelain plaques for him and forced the artist You Changzi to sculpt a porcelain statue of him. When they failed to complete them on time, they were thrown into prison. In 1914, the famous porcelain painter Wang Qi and others organized the Ceramic Art Research Society to study the ceramic art of the motherland and opened an exhibition hall, but it was destroyed by the troops of the warlord Liu Baoti. Under constant persecution, the older ceramic artists had no heart to engage in ceramic art research, and the younger artists switched to other professions. Taking blue-and-white porcelain painters as an example, there were 3,000 practitioners sixty years ago, but only 130 remained before liberation! And the unfortunate deaths of elderly artists led to the loss of many precious glaze formulas! Some ceramic artists, in order to make a living, had to create erotic works with "nude beauty" paintings according to the wishes of the reactionary ruling class. The crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese people's labor—ceramic art—was thus devastated by the reactionary ruling class.

The ceramic art created by the working people can only be valued and have the possibility of continuous development in an era when the people are masters of their own affairs. Now, the days of persecution and suffering for ceramic artists in Jingdezhen are gone forever. With the recovery and development of the entire national economic construction, the sales of ceramic artworks have also expanded. Now, more than 3,500 ceramic artists in the city are living a life of abundance. The People's Government has allocated special funds for long-term relief to those elderly and artistically skilled artists so that their art can be passed on. The 73-year-old artist Wu Longfa, who received long-term support from the government, said with great emotion: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we old artists receive such care and respect." Last year, he created an outstanding blue-and-white plate, which was exhibited at the National Arts and Crafts Exhibition and received praise.

In order to help ceramic artists improve their artistic level, the People's Government has sent ceramic artists to the Beijing Arts and Crafts Exhibition for observation, so as to broaden their horizons. The Jingdezhen Ceramic Art and Craft Society has also organized the city's 40 most outstanding painting artists, and the government guarantees them a fairly ample income, so that they can conduct collective research without any worries. At the same time, the City Cooperative General Society has organized 13 porcelain painting handicraft cooperatives and 13 porcelain painting production teams to strengthen the political and professional leadership of ceramic artists.

The Party and the People's Government have taken a series of measures to develop ceramic art, and the ceramic artists deeply feel the care and warmth given to them by the Party and the People's Government. The sculptor Zeng Longsheng was elected as a provincial people's representative, which his fellow artists regard as infinite glory. Chen Honggao, a famous ceramic glaze artist who had been unemployed for more than ten years before liberation, said excitedly: "Now I have the energy to work! We artists not only have jobs, but also have our own representatives to attend the provincial People's Congress. Who knew our names in the old society!" This year, in his work on studying colored glazes, he displayed great enthusiasm and restored the Wujin glaze, which had been lost for 90 years. Recently, he creatively prepared the peacock blue glaze for the porcelain used in the Soviet exhibition hall.

Now, ceramic art has gradually restored its healthy, bright, and simple national style. New works generally reflect real life, such as resisting America and aiding Korea, the great unity of all ethnic groups, and statues of Lu Xun and Liu Hulan, which have become the themes of creation. In addition, many works with classical themes have also been created, such as the full-body statue of Qu Yuan, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, and Lu Zhishen Uprooting the Willow Tree.

How to describe the mood of ceramic artists in today's thriving Jingdezhen ceramic art? The artists of the Ceramic Art and Craft Society said it well: "In the past, we wanted to find a place to display porcelain for everyone to watch, and the People's Government opened the Ceramic Museum; in the past, we wanted everyone to be able to study together, and the government helped us organize the Craft Society; in the past, we were most afraid of losing our jobs when we were old, but now the People's Government especially respects and cares for the elderly! Our long-cherished wishes have been realized."

"Our long-cherished wishes have been realized" has become a huge force for ceramic artists, which will push the ceramic art of Jingdezhen to a higher level. (Attached pictures) Two pieces of porcelain for overseas exhibition - Vase One piece of porcelain for overseas exhibition - Hanging Plate

    陶瓷艺人实现了多年的愿望
    徐文
    景德镇不仅以生产质量优良的瓷器闻名，而且也以优美的陶瓷艺术闻名。
    近百年来，在反动统治阶级的百般摧残下，陶瓷艺术长期陷入奄奄一息的状态。在那黑暗的日子里，陶瓷艺人不但经常遭受失业、贫困和饥饿的威胁，而且不断受到官僚、军阀的层层剥削和迫害。解放前，国民党官僚酆景福强迫当时著名的画瓷艺人汪大沧给他画瓷板，强迫艺人游长子给他塑瓷像；他们没有按期做好，就被关进了监牢。一九一四年，故名画瓷家王琦等为了研究祖国的陶瓷艺术，组织了陶瓷美术研究社，开办了陈列馆，结果被军阀刘宝提的军队捣毁了。在不断遭受迫害的情形下，年老的陶瓷艺人根本没有心情进行陶瓷艺术的研究工作，年青艺人更纷纷改行转业。以画青花的艺人为例，六十年前从业者达三千人，到解放前只剩下一百三十人！而老年艺人的不幸死亡，使许多珍贵的釉彩配方失传了！有些陶瓷艺人为了生活，不得不按照反动统治阶级的意图，制造出“裸体美人”画面的充满色情的作品。中国人民劳动智慧的结晶——陶瓷艺术就这样为反动统治阶级摧残着。
    劳动人民所创造的陶瓷艺术，只有在人民自己当家做主的时代才被重视，才有获得不断发展的可能。现在，景德镇陶瓷艺人遭受迫害的、痛苦的日子永远一去不复返了。随着整个国家经济建设的恢复和发展，陶瓷艺术品的销路也扩大了。现在全市三千五百多名陶瓷艺人都过着丰衣足食的生活了。人民政府对那些年老力衰，艺术水平较高的艺人，拨出专款长期救济，使他们的艺术能够传授下来。七十三岁的老艺人吴龙发受到政府的长期供给，非常感动地说：“只有在共产党的领导下，我们老艺人才能受到这样的爱护和尊重。”去年他创作了出色的青花盘，在全国美术工艺品展览会上展出，得到了好评。
    人民政府为了帮助陶瓷艺人提高艺术水平，曾经派遣陶瓷艺人到北京美术工艺品展览会进行观摩，借以扩大他们的眼界。景德镇的陶瓷美术工艺社还把全市四十名最优秀的彩绘艺人组织起来，政府保证他们相当充裕的收入，使他们无所牵挂地进行集体研究。与此同时，市合作总社已组织了十三个画瓷手工业合作社和十三个画瓷生产小组，加强了对陶瓷艺人的政治领导和业务领导。
    党和人民政府采取了发展陶瓷艺术的一系列措施，陶瓷艺人深深感受到党和人民政府对他们的关怀和给予他们的温暖。雕塑家曾龙升当选为省人民代表以后，同行艺人更引为无限光荣。解放前失业十多年的著名陶瓷釉彩艺人陈鸿高兴奋地说：“现在做事才有劲啦！我们艺人不仅有了工作做，而且还能有自己的代表出席省的人民代表大会会议，在旧社会有谁知道我们艺人的名字！”今年在研究色釉的工作中，他发挥了高度热情，恢复了失传九十年的乌金釉，最近他又创造性地配制了苏联展览馆定瓷用的孔雀蓝色釉。
    现在，陶瓷艺术已逐渐恢复了健康、明朗、简朴的民族风格。新的作品一般都反映了现实生活，如抗美援朝、各民族大团结以及鲁迅和刘胡兰的塑像，都成为创作的主题；此外，还创作了不少古典题材的作品，如屈原全身像、梁山伯与祝英台、鲁智深倒拔垂杨柳等。
    在景德镇陶瓷艺术蒸蒸日上的今天，如何来描写陶瓷艺人的心情呢？陶瓷美术工艺社的艺人们说的好：“我们从前想找个地方陈列瓷器，供大家观摩，人民政府就开办了陶瓷馆；从前想大家能在一起研究，政府帮我们组织了工艺社；从前我们顶怕年老了失业，现在人民政府对老年人特别尊重和照顾！我们多年的愿望实现了。”
    “我们多年的愿望实现了”这句话已经变成陶瓷艺人的巨大力量，它将把瓷都景德镇的陶瓷艺术推向更高的水平。（附图片）出国展览的瓷器之二——花瓶出国展览的瓷器之一——挂盘
