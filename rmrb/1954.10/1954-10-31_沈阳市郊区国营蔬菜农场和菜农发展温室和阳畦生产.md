    State-owned Vegetable Farms and Vegetable Farmers in the Suburbs of Shenyang Develop Greenhouse and Sunken Greenhouse Production
    This year, state-owned vegetable farms and vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang have developed over 25,000 square meters of greenhouse and sunken greenhouse production. Currently, the construction of all greenhouses has been completed. The ten newly built glass greenhouses of the state-owned vegetable farm (covering an area of over 4,000 square meters) have already begun production. The seedlings to be cultivated in the greenhouses by the farm and vegetable farmers are now all ready. The tomato and cucumber seedlings of the state-owned farm have even sprouted tendrils and blossomed. Vegetable production cooperatives such as Xiaoyu, Hongguang, Qianjin, and Hongjin sowed seeds in temporary seedbeds more than a month ago, and now the seedlings have sprouted three or four leaves and are growing very vigorously. Vegetable farmers in other districts such as Huanggu, Tiexi, and Shenhe are also busy with raising seedlings and sowing seeds. It is expected that around the New Year, the people of Shenyang will be able to eat fresh vegetables such as cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers, eggplants, and kidney beans produced by local vegetable farmers.

    沈阳市郊区国营蔬菜农场和菜农发展温室和阳畦生产
    沈阳市郊区国营蔬菜农场和菜农，今年发展了两万五千余平方公尺的温室和阳畦生产。目前，各温室的修建工程都已竣工。国营蔬菜农场新建的十幢玻璃温室（面积达四千余平方公尺）已开始生产。农场和菜农准备在温室里栽培的菜苗，现已全部育好。国营农场的西红柿、黄瓜苗有的都吐了须和开了花，小榆、红光、前进，红巾等蔬菜生产合作社，早在一个多月以前就在临时苗床内播了种，现在幼苗已冒出了三、四片叶子，生长得非常茁壮。其他如皇姑、铁西、沈河等区的菜农，也正在紧张地忙着育苗、播种。预计在新年前后，沈阳市广大人民，就可以吃到由当地菜农们生产的黄瓜、西红柿、青椒、茄子、芸豆等新鲜蔬菜。
