Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th: The headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Military Region issued two circulars in late September, commending artillery units for achieving significant victories at a small cost.

    The circular of September 22 stated: On September 10th at 10:10 AM, a certain artillery unit of our forces, using only dozens of shells, annihilated a howitzer company of the Chiang bandit army equipped with 105mm guns. The circular pointed out that the reasons for achieving the above results were mainly due to the unit's ability to conduct close observation, accurately grasp the enemy's situation, and employ mobile and flexible command. This is worthy of emulation by all artillery units.

    The circular of September 27 stated: On September 22nd at 17:15, the participating artillery units in the surprise attack on the Chiang bandit army on Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands achieved a hit rate of over 95%, inflicting heavy blows on the Chiang bandit army, while we suffered no casualties. On September 23rd, the Chiang bandit air force and the ground artillery of the Chiang bandit army on Kinmen Island retaliated against us, but our artillery effectively suppressed the enemy's artillery firing points; our anti-aircraft artillery shot down and damaged nine Chiang bandit aircraft.

    The circular concluded by emphasizing: The above-mentioned artillery units achieved great victories at a small cost, which is worthy of commendation. It is hoped that all units will continue their efforts to inflict heavier blows on the Chiang bandit army and strive for greater victories.

    解放军福建军区表扬炮兵部队
   【新华社福州八日电】中国人民解放军福建军区司令部于九月下旬先后二次发出通报，表扬以微小代价取得重大胜利的炮兵部队。
    九月二十二日的通报中说：我某炮兵部队于九月十日十时十分，仅用数十发炮弹，就消灭了蒋贼军一个一零五公厘口径的榴弹炮连。通报指出取得上述战绩的原因，主要是由于某炮兵部队能够严密地进行观察、准确地掌握敌情，和指挥上的机动、灵活等。这是值得各炮兵部队学习的。
    九月二十七日的通报中说：九月二十二日十七时十五分急袭大、小金门岛上蒋贼军的各参战炮兵部队，命中率都在百分之九十五以上，给蒋贼军以沉重打击，而我毫无伤亡。九月二十三日，蒋贼空军和金门岛蒋贼军的地面炮兵向我进行报复，但我炮兵有效地压制了敌人的炮兵火力点；我高射炮兵并击落击伤蒋贼飞机九架。
    通报最后强调指出：上述炮兵部队以小的代价取得了很大的胜利，这是值得表扬的。希望各部队再接再厉，给蒋贼军更沉重的打击，争取更大的胜利。
