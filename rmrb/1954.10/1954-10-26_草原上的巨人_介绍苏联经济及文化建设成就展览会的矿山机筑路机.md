    In the east square of the Central Industry Pavilion at the Soviet Economic and Cultural Achievement Exhibition, visitors gathered around the huge mining and roadbuilding machines, listening to the explanations of the guides.
    On display here are seven coal mining machines, ten oil extraction machines, and eight roadbuilding machines. Those who have seen the Soviet film "Donbas Miners" know how Soviet coal miners use machines to work. The "Donbas" coal mining combine, weighing about seven tons, can complete the entire coal mining process—from coal excavation to coal crushing and loading. It can mine coal in coal seams one to two meters high and on gently sloping inclines of up to forty degrees. It can excavate 50 to 110 tons of coal per hour, equivalent to the labor of 15 to 20 people.
    Soviet experts started the machines on the spot and explained the performance and efficiency of the machines in detail to everyone. Ma Liu Hai, a national model worker and coal miner from Datong Coal Mine, looked at the "Donbas" coal mining combine and recalled his 26 years as a miner. He used to crawl on the ground to pull coal, carry coal, and push coal, expending a lot of effort and sweat, but only being able to mine very little coal. After liberation, Datong Coal Mine also used machines, and the workers constantly created new production records. He said: We must learn from the Soviet Union, increase production, and be like the Soviet coal miners.
    Next to the "Donbas" coal mining combine, the powerful coal cutting machine produced by the Kirov Mining Machinery Factory is on display. It is not large, but it is very powerful. It can mine coal in thin coal seams of 0.5 meters or more and can excavate a slot of about 40 meters per hour.
    The scraper conveyor, over twenty meters long, attracted the coal miners who came to visit. It can be extended to a maximum of 150 meters and can transport 100 to 130 tons of coal per hour. Mo Ziyuan, a labor model and worker from Jingxi Chengzi Coal Mine, and Bai Jilin, an old coal miner, both said: This thing is really big and heavy. The guide said: Yes, if it is connected to 150 meters long, hundreds of people cannot lift it. But you don't need to worry about that. The scraper and chain of this machine itself are movable, and can be connected or disassembled. This machine looks very bulky, but it is very convenient to move. Many Soviet coal mines are using it now.
    Here is a light drilling machine, which can drill vertical, inclined, and horizontal holes in the coal seam. It can drill through any hardness of coal seam or rock-containing coal seam for ventilation, drainage, and gas extraction. This is an indispensable machine in coal mines.
    The mechanization level of the Soviet coal mining industry reached the first place in the world in 1937. Now, the Soviet coal mining industry is equipped with more than 1,400 coal mining combines, nearly 2,500 coal and rock loading combines, and many powerful coal mining machines, conveyors, and electric locomotives for coal transportation.
    To the south of the east square, many tall drilling machines are on display. The automatic folding oil drilling rig is 16 meters high. Drilling worker Li Changqing loved this machine very much. He said to the audience: It looks so bulky, but it moves very nimbly. All of its equipment is mounted on a car. When starting drilling, only one person needs to drive, and in more than ten minutes, the tall drill pipe can be fully erected. When drilling stops, the drill pipe will automatically fold. It can drill 500 meters deep per minute. If moving is also very convenient, it can be packed up in less than half an hour.
    Here is also an oil pumping unit weighing more than 20 tons. It can drive a water pump to suck oil from the oil well to the ground (to a maximum depth of 2,500 meters). The structure of the pumping unit is very simple and strong, and it is flexible and convenient to use. There are also four electrical measuring vehicles, divided into two groups, two in each group. One group forms an automatic electrical measuring station, and the other group forms a ground electrical measuring station. The automatic electrical measuring station includes a winch and a laboratory. The laboratory has automatic photographic equipment to record the results of mine measurements; the winch can be used in oil wells 2,000 meters deep to carry out exploration work. The ground electrical measuring station can carry out deep soil exploration, observe and record changes in the soil layer. Drilling worker Li Changqing said: In the past, geologists always had to drill out the sand first, and after very complicated laboratory work, they could evaluate the oil content underground. With this kind of scientific equipment, there is no need to go through such complicated procedures.
    Here is also a mud truck, which can automatically discharge mud, allowing the mud to flow to a depth of 2,350 meters. Therefore, it can well protect the drill bit, drill pipe and wellbore, making drilling work more accurate and secure.
    From the above-mentioned various automated and mechanized equipment, people can see the technical level of the Soviet oil industry. The Soviet Union can now not only drill straight wells, but also drill curved wells. If an oil spring is found to be located next to the drilling well, a curved well can be drilled in the direction of the oil spring, without having to drill a new well. This is a surprising achievement in Soviet drilling technology.
    In the northern part of the east square, ten large machines stand tall. Among them, three are huge single-bucket excavators, produced in 1954. It has a long steel arm with an iron bucket hanging on it. When the machine is started, the digging bucket with four steel teeth inserts into the soil, and it can dig one cubic meter of soil at once and send it to a place several meters away. It can dig 1,400 to 1,500 cubic meters of soil per day, equivalent to the labor of 700 to 800 people, but it only takes one person to operate. The single-bucket excavator is also called a universal excavator. Its working parts—boom and bucket—can be completely replaced and converted into a 15-ton crane or pile driver.
    Next to the single-bucket excavator is a multi-bucket excavator. It is a new product of 1954, which can excavate ditches with a width of 0.8 to 1.1 meters and a depth of 2.5 meters; it can dig 135 cubic meters of soil per hour. A vibrating pile driver is also on display here, which uses motor transmission and is very efficient, driving down 1.5 meters per minute.
    The asphalt spreader also attracted people's attention. Its structure is delicate, and the inside of the oil tank is provided with an insulation layer to prevent heat loss and keep the asphalt at a certain temperature. The oil tank also has heating equipment, which can melt the asphalt.
    The comrades in charge of installation told everyone: "The machines displayed here are all small machines. The excavators used in the Soviet communist construction projects are many times larger than single-bucket excavators." Yes, people can see from pictorials and movies: the walking excavator used in the Volga-Don Canal construction project, one bucket can hold 14 cubic meters of soil, equivalent to the volume of a car; the mud dug out at one time can fill half a train car, and can automatically transport the mud to a place 130 meters away. On the construction site of the Volga-Don Canal, there is also a water-absorbing dredger, which can dig enough soil to fill 1,000 train cars in 24 hours.
    The Soviet people call these powerful machines "giants of the grassland." They have greatly promoted the communist construction project and accelerated the construction process. (Attached picture)

    草原上的巨人
    ——介绍苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的矿山机筑路机
    培蓝
    在苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的中央工业馆的东广场上，参观的人围着那些巨大的矿山机器和筑路机器，倾听着讲解员的解释。
    这里陈列着七部采煤机、十部开采石油的机器、八部筑路机。看过苏联影片“顿巴斯矿工”的人们，都知道苏联煤矿工人怎样利用机器来进行工作。重七吨左右的“顿巴斯”采煤联合机，可以完成整个的采煤过程——从掘煤一直到碎煤、装煤。它能在一公尺至二公尺高的煤层中采煤，又可以在四十度以下缓倾斜的坡上采煤。它每小时可以掘煤五十吨到一百一十吨，抵上十五个人到二十个人的劳动。
    苏联专家当场开动机器，详细地向大家介绍机器的性能和效率。全国劳动模范、大同煤矿工人马六孩看了“顿巴斯”采煤联合机，想起了自己二十六年来的矿工生活。他曾经爬在地上拉煤、背煤、推煤，不知费了多少气力，流了多少汗水，但只能采出很少的煤。解放以后，大同煤矿也使用了机器，工人们不断创造生产新纪录。他说：我们一定要好好学习苏联，提高生产，像苏联的煤矿工人一样。
    在“顿巴斯”采煤联合机旁边，陈列着基洛夫矿山机械工厂出产的强力截煤机。它的个子不大，但是威力很强。它可以在零点五公尺以上的薄煤层采煤，一小时能掏出四十公尺左右的槽。
    二十几公尺长的刮板运输机吸引了来这里参观的煤矿工人。它最多能够接长一百五十公尺，每小时运输一百吨到一百三十吨煤。京西城子煤矿工人、劳动模范莫子元和老采煤工人白吉林都说：这玩艺真大、真重。讲解员说：是的，如果接到一百五十公尺长，几百个人也抬不起来。可是你不需要担心这一点。这台机器本身的刮板和练子都是活动的，可以接起来，也可以拆开。这种机器看起来很笨重，但移动起来非常方便。现在苏联许多煤矿都使用了。
    这里有一台轻便穿孔机，它可以在煤层中进行垂直的、倾斜的和水平的钻孔。它能够钻透任何硬度煤层或含有岩石的煤层，以供通风、排水和排除瓦斯用。这是煤矿中必不可少的机器。
    苏联采煤工业的机械化程度，一九三七年就达到了世界第一位。现在，苏联的煤矿工业中装备着一千四百多部采煤联合机，将近二千五百部装煤和装岩联动机，还有许多马力强大的挖煤机、运输机和运煤用的电气机车。
    东广场的南边，陈列着许多高大的钻井机器。自动折叠式石油钻探机，高达十六公尺。钻井工人李长清非常喜爱这部机器，他向观众说：看起来它是那样的笨重，走起来可是非常灵便。它的全部设备都安在汽车上。开始钻探时，只需要一个人开车，十多分钟工夫便可以使高大的钻杆全部直立起来。钻探停止了，钻杆会自动地折叠起来。它每分钟可以钻五百公尺深。如果移动也很方便，用不了半个钟头就可以把它收拾好。
    这里还有一台二十多吨重的抽油机。它能带动抽水泵，把油井里的油吸到地面上来（最深能达到二千五百公尺）。抽油机的构造很简单，很坚固，使用起来，又灵活，又方便。这里还有四部电测车，分为两组，每组两部。一组组成自动电测站，另一组组成地面测电站。自动电测站包括一台卷扬机和一个实验室。实验室中有自动摄影设备，纪录矿场测量的结果；卷扬机可用在二千公尺深的油井中，从事探测工作。地面测电站可以进行深土勘测，观察和纪录土层的变化情况。钻井工人李长清说：从前地质学家总是先把砂钻探出来，经过很复杂的化验工作，才能评定地下的含油量。有了这种科学设备，就无须经过那么繁复的手续了。
    这里还有一台泥浆车，它可以自动排泄泥浆，使泥浆流到两千三百五十公尺深的地方。因此，它能很好地保护钻头、钻杆和井筒，使钻探工作更加准确和有保障。
    从上述种种自动化机械化的设备，人们可以看到苏联石油工业的技术水平。苏联现在不仅可以钻探直井，而且可以钻探曲井。在钻探中发现油泉偏处在钻井的旁边，可以在地心钻曲井以通油泉，不必另钻新井。这是苏联钻井技术上一个惊人的成就。
    在东广场的北部，耸立着十部大型的机器。其中有三部是巨大的单斗挖掘机，一九五四年出品。它有一条长长的钢臂，钢臂上吊着一个铁斗。机器开动时，带有四个钢牙的掘斗插入土里，一下就可以挖掘一立方土，并把它送到几公尺以外的地方去。它每天能挖土一千四、五百方，相当于七、八百人的劳动量，但只要一个人操作。单斗挖掘机也叫万能挖掘机，它的工作部分——吊杆、挖斗可以整个换掉，改装为十五吨的起重机或打桩机。
    在单斗挖掘机的旁边，有一台多斗挖掘机。它是一九五四年的新产品，可以挖掘宽零点八到一点一公尺，深二点五公尺的沟渠；一小时能挖一百三十五方土。这里还展览着一台震动式打桩机，利用马达传动，效率很高，每分钟可打下一点五公尺。
    沥青洒布机同样引起人们的注意。它的构造精细，油罐内部设有绝缘层，借以防止热量散失，使沥青保持一定的温度。油罐箱还有加热设备，可以溶化沥青。
    负责安装工作的同志对大家说：“这里陈列的机器，都是一些小型机器，在苏联共产主义建设工程中使用的挖掘机，比单斗挖掘机要大好多倍。”是的，人们从画报、电影上可以看到：在伏尔加河—顿河运河建筑工程中使用的步行式挖掘机，一只掘斗可以装十四方土，相当于一辆汽车的体积；一次挖出的泥可以装满半个火车厢，并能自动把泥运送到一百三十公尺以外的地方。在伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑工地上，还有一种吸水挖泥机，它可以在二十四小时内挖掘装满一千个火车皮的泥土。
    苏联人民称这些强大有力的机器为“草原巨人”，它们大大地推动了共产主义的建设工程，加速了建设的进程。(附图片)
