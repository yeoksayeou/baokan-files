Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Currently, autumn grain has begun to be harvested successively, and the unified purchase of grain after the autumn harvest will be universally launched throughout the country. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the unified purchase work, the Ministry of Food recently issued instructions to all levels of food departments, requiring all localities to earnestly prepare for several operational tasks before the unified purchase of grain, including determining locations and demarcating areas, pricing according to quality, receiving and storing grain in warehouses, organizing transportation and dispatch, allocating funds, and gradually carrying out technical organization work for calculating and distributing tasks in the unified purchase and sale of grain.
    In terms of determining locations and demarcating areas, the instructions stated: Before the start of the unified purchase, the food departments should, in accordance with the principles of "adapting to the allocation plan and the direction of grain circulation, as well as transportation, warehouse, and processing conditions, while considering local supply and demand and facilitating farmers' sales," plan and uniformly stipulate grain collection points (including cooperative agency collection points), and specifically delineate the grain collection scope of each grain collection point. In this regard, it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of too many points and a wide area, which cannot be taken care of and no one is responsible for as much as possible. In order to take care of the actual difficulties of a small number of farmers, farmers may be allowed to sell grain in advance before the unified purchase, and in principle, they should sell it to a certain point. The instructions also pointed out that the work of determining locations and demarcating areas must be done in advance.
    The instructions especially emphasized that pricing according to quality should be done well in this year's unified purchase. The instructions believe that the primary and basic condition for doing this work well is to carry out full political mobilization to farmers in advance, calling on and organizing farmers to dry and clean the grain, and sell good grain. In business, several measures should also be taken:
    First, correctly grasp the quality standards. First of all, it is necessary to correctly stipulate the medium quality standard; secondly, according to the dryness, cleanliness, and fullness of the grain, appropriately stipulate the quality grade, but the quality grade should not be too many, and the grade set in the adjacent areas should be consistent.
    Second, combine quality inspection work from two aspects: on the one hand, organize farmers to compare with each other, inspect in the village, and ensure that bad grain does not leave the village; on the other hand, inspect the quality at the grain collection point, determine the grade and price, but the acceptance procedures must be simplified.
    Third, strengthen the leadership of the quality inspection personnel. Food departments at all levels should, together with cooperatives, uniformly train quality inspection personnel before the unified purchase; strengthen leadership and supervision of quality inspection personnel during the quality inspection process, and continuously conduct inspections, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and correct deviations.
    Regarding the receipt of grain into warehouses and the organization of transportation, the instructions stated: This year's autumn grain unified purchase task is large and the time is short, and the concentration of warehousing work is even greater. Therefore, food departments in various regions should actively renovate existing granaries, improve storage methods, and vigorously organize parallel warehousing and centralized transportation before the unified purchase; at the same time, they should strive to complete the construction of new warehouses in advance in order to receive new grain. If the warehouse problem still cannot be solved, various regions can rent private houses as needed, and open-air storage can be organized in areas with conditions. During the unified purchase period, transportation work should also be done at the same time, which can not only alleviate the difficulty of insufficient warehouse capacity, but also meet the needs of supply. During centralized transportation, various regions must take into account local supply needs, reasonable inventory, and processing capacity to avoid backhaul. In addition, in the warehousing work, it is also necessary to achieve safe warehousing, promote advanced experience, improve the procedures and systems of each grain collection point, and earnestly do a good job in disinfecting empty warehouses and cleaning sanitation, pay attention to checking the safety of warehouses, and strengthen safety equipment. In areas with conditions, different varieties or different qualities of grain should be stored separately.
    The instructions also pointed out that in the unified purchase of grain, it is necessary to do a good job in fund allocation in order to rationally use funds; to gradually carry out technical organization work for calculating and distributing tasks in the unified purchase and sale of grain, so as to specifically grasp the production, consumption, surplus, and shortage of grain in rural areas, and further improve the purchase and sale of grain in rural areas.
    The instructions finally required that the food departments in various regions must regard the above-mentioned business preparation work as a major political and economic work, and under the direct leadership of the party committees and governments at all levels, plan carefully, proceed prudently, and do their utmost to do a good job.

    粮食部指示各级粮食部门
    做好秋粮统购准备工作
    【新华社十四日讯】目前秋粮已次第登场，秋后粮食统购工作就将在全国各地普遍展开。为保证统购工作顺利进行，粮食部最近向各级粮食部门发出指示，要求各地在粮食统购前，切实做好定点划片、依质论价、收粮入库和组织调运、资金调度、逐步开展粮食统购统销中计算分配任务的技术组织工作等几项业务上的准备工作。
    在定点划片方面，指示说：粮食部门在统购开始前，应根据“调拨计划和适应粮食流转方向以及交通、仓库、加工条件，结合当地供需情况，照顾农民缴售方便”的原则，有计划地、统一地规定收粮点（包括合作社代收点），并具体划定每一收粮点的收粮范围。在这方面必须尽可能防止点多面广，无法照顾和无人负责的现象发生。为了照顾少数农民的实际困难，在统购前可允许农民提前出售粮食，原则上应到一定的点出售。指示还指出定点划片工作必须提前做好。
    指示特别强调今年统购中要做好依质论价工作。指示认为做好这一工作的首要的、基本的条件，是事前向农民进行充分的政治动员，号召和组织农民晒干颺净，缴售好粮。在业务上还要采取几个措施：
    第一，正确掌握质量标准。首先要正确规定中等质量标准；其次要根据粮食的干、净、饱等程度，适当规定质量等级，但质量等级也不宜过多，接壤地区所定等级应力求一致。
    第二，从两方面结合进行质量检验工作：一方面组织农民互相评比，就村检验，做到坏粮不出村；另一方面在收粮点验质，定等作价，但验收手续必须简化。
    第三，加强对验质人员的领导。各级粮食部门应会同合作社在统购前统一训练验质人员；在验质过程中对验质人员加强领导和监督，并不断进行检查，及时交流经验，纠正偏差。
    关于收粮入库和组织调运，指示说：今年秋粮统购任务大，时间短，入库工作的集中性更大，因此各地粮食部门应积极整修现有粮库，改善存储办法，并在统购前大力组织并仓集运；同时要争取新建仓库提前完工，以便接收新粮。如果仓库问题仍不能解决时，各地可根据需要租借民房，在有条件的地区可组织露天存放。在统购期间，同时要做好调运工作，这不仅能减轻仓容不足的困难，并且能适应供应需要。在集中调运时，各地必须照顾本地供应需要、合理库存和加工能力，避免倒运回流。此外，在入库工作上还必须做到安全入库，推广先进经验，改善各收粮点的手续和制度，并切实做好空仓消毒，清洁卫生工作，注意检查仓库安全情况，加强安全设备。在有条件的地区，应把不同品种或不同质量的粮食分别储存。
    指示还指出在粮食统购中要做好资金调度工作，以合理地使用资金；要逐步开展统购统销工作中计算分配任务的技术组织工作，以便能具体地掌握农村粮食的产、消、余、缺等情况，进一步改进农村粮食的购销工作。
    指示最后要求，各地粮食部门必须把上述各项业务准备工作看成是重大的政治工作和经济工作，在各级党委和政府直接领导下，周密计划，审慎进行，尽最大的努力做好。
