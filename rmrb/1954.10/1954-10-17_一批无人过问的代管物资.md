Reader's Letters Summary:

    A Batch of Unattended Custodial Materials
    Feng Zongshan, Weng Tongfu, and Mao Xiguang from the Boshan Building Materials Industry School of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry write: Our school has been holding over twenty boxes of materials for about three years, and until now, no one has been responsible for handling these materials.

    These materials were entrusted to our school for temporary safekeeping by the Shandong Office of the former East China Industrial Department when it moved to Jinan in 1951. In 1952, when the Shandong Office of the former East China Industrial Department merged with the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry, the Shandong Office of the former East China Industrial Department sent comrades Ma Yong and another comrade to complete the custodial procedures, mainly to obtain a receipt from our school for the materials in our custody. At that time, he told us that these materials included mineral specimens, finished product models, as well as machines and instruments, and that many were said to be valuable materials; in addition, he said that there were also chemical reagents and explosives in the boxes. However, since there was no record of the boxed materials, what Comrade Ma Yong said was only an estimate. He hastily renumbered the boxes and left.

    Since then, no one has inquired about these materials. We have inquired with the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry, and they said that these materials had been transferred to the Shandong Mining and Metallurgical Office of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry's Iron and Steel Industry Administration. Our school has repeatedly sent letters urging the Shandong Mining and Metallurgical Office to handle them promptly. In the summer of 1953, a section chief from the Shandong Mining and Metallurgical Office came. He looked at the materials and, upon hearing that there might be explosives in the boxes, hurriedly replied, "We must bring in an expert to examine them." The section chief then left, and no one ever came to examine them. Our school had no choice but to continue holding these materials in custody.

    Since then, we have repeatedly sent letters urging them, but the results have always been like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response. We are wondering: How long are we supposed to keep these twenty-odd boxes of materials in custody?
      Editor's Note: The situation reflected in the letter from readers Feng Zongshan, et al., has been verified as true by the Shandong Mining and Metallurgical Office after being forwarded by the Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry. These materials were originally exhibits from the Boshan Exhibition Hall of the former East China Industrial Department Shandong Office. In 1951, when the office moved to Jinan, they were entrusted to the Boshan Building Materials Industry School for safekeeping. In 1952, after the office merged with the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry, the Mineral Products Division was established under the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry, and this batch of exhibits was managed by the Mineral Products Division, but because no suitable storage location was found in Jinan at the time, they were still placed in Boshan. In 1953, the Mineral Products Division of the Department of Industry was abolished, and the Shandong Mining and Metallurgical Office was established, directly under the leadership of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry. During the organizational changes, no handover procedures were completed for these materials, resulting in a long-term situation where no one was responsible for handling them. After this newspaper forwarded the readers' exposé to the Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry for investigation, the administration has ordered the Shandong Mining and Metallurgical Office to inspect Boshan jointly with the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry and to properly handle these materials.

### 一批无人过问的代管物资

专栏：读者来信摘要

    一批无人过问的代管物资
    中央重工业部博山建筑材料工业学校冯宗山、翁通福、冒锡光来信：我们学校里代管着二十余箱物资已经三年左右，直到现在这批物资还是无人负责处理。
    这批物资是原华东工业部山东办事处在一九五一年迁往济南时交我校暂为代管的。一九五二年原华东工业部山东办事处与山东省工业厅合并时，原华东工业部山东办事处曾派马勇等两位同志来补办代管手续，主要是来取一张我校代管物资的收据。当时他告诉我们，这些物资中有矿石标本、成品模型以及机器、仪器等，据说有不少是贵重物资；此外，他又说箱内还有化学药品和炸药。但是，由于箱装物资根本没有记录，马勇同志所说的也只是估计而已。他草率地把这批箱子重新编了号就走了。
    从此以后，这批物资就没有人来过问了。我们曾向山东省府工业厅查问，他们说这些物资已移交给中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业管理局山东矿冶办事处了。我校又多次去信催山东矿冶办事处迅速处理。一九五三年夏季，山东矿冶办事处来了一位科长。他把这批物资看了一下，一听箱内可能装有炸药，连忙回答说：“必须抽出内行人来检验一下才行。”这位科长就此扬长而去，以后根本没有人来检验。这批物资只好由我校又继续代管下去。
    以后，我们又屡次去信催促，结果都是石沉大海，永无回音。我们感到奇怪：这二十余箱物资究竟要让我们代管多久呢？
      编者按：读者冯宗山等来信反映的情况，经中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局转交山东矿冶办事处检查，证明是确实的。这批物资原系前华东工业部山东办事处博山陈列馆的陈列品，一九五一年该处迁移济南时就交博山建筑材料工业学校代管。一九五二年该处和山东省工业厅合并后，山东省工业厅成立矿产处，这批陈列品就由矿产处负责管理，但因当时在济南没有找到适当存放处所，仍旧放置在博山。一九五三年工业厅矿产处撤销，成立山东矿冶办事处，直属中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局领导。在机构变动时，这批物资没有办理接交手续，因而出现了长期无人负责处理的现象。经本报将读者揭发信转中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局检查后，该局已令山东矿冶办事处会同山东省工业厅到博山检查，并把这批物资作适当处理。
