    Chen Jiageng issued a written statement in support of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué. The full text is as follows:
    The documents released from the Sino-Soviet talks are imbued with the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, marking the two countries' shared desire to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. The sincerity and selfless nature of Soviet aid to our country is clear even to the most foolish. Since our country's liberation, some overseas Chinese have suspected that the socialist camp is dominated by the Soviet Union, with other countries being mere appendages lacking independent autonomy. Upon seeing this communiqué, their doubts should be completely dispelled.
    The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and China are built upon the same founding principles. The Soviet Union is the first country in the world to successfully implement socialism, and our country is also gradually transitioning to a socialist society. Common aspirations and a common will constitute a reliable foundation for cooperation between the two countries. In order to promote common progress and prosperity, thereby promoting peace in the Far East and the world, the two countries must be as close as brothers, share weal and woe, unite to resist aggression, and shatter the conspiracies of international schemers. Moreover, the two countries share a border, are as close as lips and teeth, and the importance of their relationship cannot be expressed in mere words; it goes beyond mere friendship and social interaction.
    Our country is a large nation with a population of 600 million, and its people are diligent, brave, and possess an extremely excellent cultural tradition. The previous weakness was caused by the feudal autocracy of the Qing Dynasty and the corrupt politics of the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek clique. The Communist Party of China, led by Chairman Mao, sought freedom and equality for China, struggled for decades, and finally achieved a great victory, establishing the People's Republic of China. In the past five years, with the selfless help of the Soviet Union, the national economy has recovered and developed, the country's strength has been growing, and it ranks among the world's leading powers. Who can deny its status as a major power? To slander us as an "appendage" is utterly ignorant and foolish!
    The purpose of the United States' foreign policy is aggression, so it is hostile to peace and hostile to our country and the Soviet Union. The purpose of the Soviet Union's and our country's foreign policies is the opposite; therefore, they have consistently worked to ease international tensions and safeguard the cause of world peace. Recently, our country has developed relations with various countries in Asia and the Pacific region and other countries based on the Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, which is ample evidence of this. The joint declaration of China and the Soviet Union on Sino-Soviet relations and international issues reiterates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which is of great significance for further promoting international friendship and cooperation.
    I am deeply moved by the Soviet Union's just attitude in supporting our liberation of Taiwan. The head of the Soviet government delegation, Khrushchev, in his speech at the National Day celebration meeting in the capital, expressed deep sympathy and determination to support our liberation of Taiwan; the joint declaration also condemned the United States' continued occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and its military and financial aid to the Chiang Kai-shek group, the enemy of the Chinese people. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and China must liberate Taiwan. Faced with the increasingly powerful strength of the Chinese people and the increasingly consolidated and developed alliance between the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, the aggressive US clique's attempt to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union and interfere in our country's reckless actions to liberate Taiwan will surely fail.
    International conditions are favorable to us. Inspired by the further close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, the people of the whole country are fighting with full confidence to complete the first year's task of the Five-Year Plan and to liberate Taiwan. Overseas Chinese compatriots should unite, love the country, and support the struggle of the people of the motherland.

### 陈嘉庚发表书面谈话

    陈嘉庚发表书面谈话
    陈嘉庚为拥护中苏会谈公报发表书面谈话，全文如下：
    这次中苏会谈公布的文件，都贯彻着平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的精神，标志着两国维护远东与世界和平的一致愿望。苏联援助我国的诚心诚意，至公无私，虽愚鲁者流，亦可了解。我国解放以来，国外尚有一部分华侨，怀疑社会主义阵营是苏联为主，其他国家多属附庸，乏独立自主权；见此公报，疑虑应尽释矣。
    苏联和中国的友好关系，乃建立在同一的立国精神之上。苏联是世界上第一个实行社会主义成功之国家，我国也正逐步过渡到社会主义社会。共同的愿望，共同的意志，构成两国合作的可靠基础。两国为促进共同进步与繁荣，从而促进远东与世界和平，必须亲如兄弟，祸福与共，团结御侮，打破国际野心家的阴谋。况两国国境相接，唇齿相依，其关系之重大，岂言词笔墨所能形容，非同朋友情谊社交而已。
    我国是一个人口六万万的大国，人民勤劳勇敢，有极优秀的文化传统。前此之积弱系满清封建专制及国民党蒋匪集团贪污腐败政治所造成。毛主席领导的中国共产党谋求中国之自由平等，奋斗数十年，终于取得伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。五年来，在苏联的无私帮助下，国民经济从恢复到发展，国势蒸蒸日上，与世界一等强国并列，大国地位，谁能否认？乃谤我为“附庸”，真愚妄无知之极耳！
    美国的对外政策，目的在于侵略，故敌视和平，敌视我国与苏联。苏联与我国的外交政策，目的则反之，故一贯为缓和国际紧张局势，维护世界和平事业而努力。最近我国根据互相尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处的五项原则，发展同亚洲及太平洋区域的各个国家以及其他国家的关系，足为明证。中苏两国关于中苏关系和国际形势各项问题的联合宣言重申和平共处五项原则，对于进一步促进国际友好合作，具有重大意义。
    苏联支持我国解放台湾的正义态度，使我深为感动。苏联政府代表团团长赫鲁晓夫在首都各界国庆庆祝大会的讲话中，对我解放台湾表示深切同情与支持决心；联合宣言又斥责美国对中国领土台湾的继续侵占以及它对中国人民公敌蒋介石集团的军事和财政援助。台湾是中国的领土，中国一定要解放台湾。面对日益强大的中国人民的力量，面对日益巩固和发展的中苏两大国的同盟关系，美国侵略集团妄图挑拨中苏关系，干涉我国解放台湾的蛮干行动，必定失败。
    国际条件有利于我，全国人民正在中苏两国进一步密切合作的鼓舞下，满怀信心地为完成五年计划第一年任务、为解放台湾而奋斗。国外侨胞应以团结爱国，支援祖国人民的斗争。　　（新华社）
