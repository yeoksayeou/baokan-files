Hebei Province farmers are carefully harvesting their crops to significantly increase the autumn grain yield. According to a typical investigation of 69 villages and 29 agricultural production cooperatives in seven special districts including Tangshan and Shijiazhuang, the autumn grain crops that have undergone careful harvesting this year can yield an average of three to five more jin per mu. According to incomplete statistics from 21 counties including Leting and Shangdu, farmers have harvested a total of more than 9,255,000 jin of grain through careful harvesting. In the past, farmers in Huanghua County were relatively rough in their harvesting methods, habitually pulling millet by hand, threshing it together with the stalks, and cutting the stalks before pinching the ears of sorghum. As a result, a significant amount of grain was lost each year. This year, thanks to the thorough education on careful harvesting conducted by the Party and government leading organs of Huanghua County, farmers were mobilized to use sickles to cut millet and then pinch the ears. For sorghum, they first shaved the ears and then pulled the stalks. They threshed the grain one or two more times and used tools such as mats, baskets, and sacks when loading and transporting it. This greatly reduced grain scattering, and the county harvested more than 1,520,000 jin from sorghum and millet alone. In Shangdu County, forty-three townships mobilized women and children to pick up scattered ears of grain during the harvest, resulting in an additional harvest of more than 470,000 jin of grain. In Qiuxian County's Guchengying Village, 1,500 mu of cowpeas and mung beans were harvested. Farmers picked them as they ripened and harvested them on damp mornings to prevent the pods from bursting and losing grains, which is estimated to have resulted in an additional harvest of 15,000 jin. The autumn harvest protection organizations established in many counties also worked hard to catch various harmful birds and animals, which played a significant role in ensuring increased grain production.

At present, the early-sown autumn grain crops in Hebei Province have been basically harvested, and the late-sown autumn grain crops have also been mostly harvested. All localities are continuing to lead farmers in carefully harvesting until the fields and threshing grounds are completely clean.

    河北省农民精收细打提高秋粮收获量
    河北省农民在秋收中精收细打，粮食收获量显著增加。据唐山、石家庄等七个专区的六十九个村又二十九个农业生产合作社的典型调查，今年经过农民精收细打的秋粮作物，平均每亩都能多收三、五斤以上。据乐亭、商都等二十一个县的不完全统计，农民在精收细打中共多收粮食九百二十五万五千多斤。黄骅县农民过去收割比较粗糙，对谷子习惯用手拔，拔后连秸轧，对高粱先砍秸，后掐穗，因此每年要耗损不少粮食。今年由于黄骅县党、政领导机关深入地向农民进行了精收细打的教育，发动农民用镰刀割谷子，割后掐穗，对高粱先削穗，后拔秸，打场时多轧一两遍，装车运送时使用席子、筐箩、口袋等工具，这样大大减少了粮食抛撒，全县只高粱、谷子两种作物就多收了一百五十二万多斤。商都县有四十三个乡收割中单是发动妇女和儿童拣拾散落的穗头，就多收了四十七万多斤粮食。邱县古城营村一千五百亩豇豆和绿豆，由于农民随熟随摘和利用早晨潮天摘，避免豆荚爆裂落粒，估计多收了一万五千斤。许多县在秋收中成立的护秋组织，都努力捕捉各种害鸟害兽，对保证粮食增产也起了很大作用。
    目前河北省早播的秋粮作物已基本收割完毕，晚播的秋粮作物也已大部收完。各地仍在继续领导农民进行精收细打，直到地净场光为止。
