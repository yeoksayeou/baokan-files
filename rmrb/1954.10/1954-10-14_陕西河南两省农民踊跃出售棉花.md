    Farmers in Shaanxi and Henan Provinces Eagerly Sell Cotton
    [Our Newspaper] Shaanxi Province has had a bumper cotton harvest this year, with total output increasing by 5.19% compared to last year, and exceeding the highest pre-Liberation annual output of 1934 by more than half. After obtaining a bumper harvest, farmers are eagerly selling cotton to the state. The province's cotton purchase task for September was completed by 102.08%.
    After the announcement of the cotton unified purchase order, various places in Shaanxi immediately publicized the policy of implementing planned cotton purchase to the broad masses of cotton farmers by organizing discussion meetings, courtyard meetings, and individual visits. The broad masses of cotton farmers warmly supported this measure and eagerly sold cotton. After September 15, the amount of cotton purchased in various places generally increased gradually. Sanyuan, Gaoling, Dali and other counties all purchased 30,000 to 40,000 catties of cotton on September 15, and the purchase volume in Dali County on September 15 and 16 more than doubled compared with September 13 and 14. Baoji Special District purchased more than 200 dan of cotton on September 15, more than 500 dan on September 16, and increased to more than 600 dan on September 17. The province's cotton purchase volume increased by more than two times in late September compared with the first and middle ten days of the month. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the cotton purchase work, the Party committees and governments in various places also strengthened their leadership over the cotton purchase work. The Baoji Special Commissioner's Office and other units dispatched work teams to key cotton producing areas to inspect and assist in carrying out the work.
    According to Xinhua News Agency: Farmers in Henan Province are supporting the state's planned cotton purchase policy with practical actions of eagerly selling cotton. In early October, although there was continuous autumn rain in Henan, the amount of cotton entering the market still increased day by day. In the last five days of September, the amount of cotton entering the market in the province reached more than 8.5 million catties, equivalent to twice the amount of cotton entering the market in the previous twenty-five days. The cotton purchase tasks for Anyang Special District and the three cities of Zhengzhou and Xinxiang in September were overfulfilled by 110% to 437%. Farmers in Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang and other special districts have sold approximately 7 million catties of cotton to the state in accordance with the pre-sale contracts signed with the state.
    In the cotton purchase work, in addition to conducting patriotic cotton selling and socialist future education to farmers, people's governments at all levels in Henan Province have also reasonably adjusted the purchase price of unginned cotton in twenty-one key cotton producing areas and major cotton distribution markets throughout the province. Farmers generally earn more by selling unginned cotton at the adjusted price than by processing unginned cotton and selling lint cotton. The state can also further control oil materials, retain improved varieties, and improve cotton quality as a result. Many grassroots cooperatives have adopted collective purchase methods of dividing areas, designating locations, dividing villages, and agreeing on times, which has brought many conveniences to farmers and greatly improved work efficiency.

### 陕西河南两省农民踊跃出售棉花

    陕西河南两省农民踊跃出售棉花
    【本报讯】陕西省今年棉花丰收，总产量比去年增加百分之五点一九，并可超过解放前一九三四年最高年产量一半以上。获得丰收后的农民正踊跃把棉花卖给国家。全省九月份棉花收购任务完成了百分之一百零二点零八。
    陕西各地在棉花统购命令公布以后，立即通过组织座谈会、院落会，进行个别访问等方式，向广大棉农宣传了实行棉花计划收购的政策。广大棉农热烈拥护这一措施，踊跃出售棉花。九月十五日以后，各地棉花收购量一般都逐渐增加。三原、高陵、大荔等县在九月十五日都收购了三、四万斤棉花，大荔县十五日、十六日两天的收购量比十三日、十四日两天增加了一倍多，宝鸡专区十五日收购棉花二百多担，十六日收购五百多担，十七日增加到六百多担。全省棉花收购量，九月下旬比上、中旬增加了两倍多。为了保证棉花收购工作的顺利进行，各地党委、政府并加强了对收购棉花工作的领导。宝鸡专署等都派出工作组到重点产棉区检查和协助开展工作。
    据新华社讯：河南省农民以踊跃出售棉花的实际行动拥护国家的棉花计划收购政策。十月上旬，河南境内虽是秋雨连绵，但棉花上市量仍逐日增加。九月的最后五天，全省棉花上市量达八百五十万斤以上，相当于前二十五天棉花上市量的一倍。安阳专区和郑州、新乡等三个市九月份棉花收购任务，超额完成了百分之一百一十到四百三十七。洛阳、郑州、新乡等专区农民已按照和国家签订的预售合同出售棉花约七百万斤给国家。
    河南省各级人民政府在棉花收购工作中，除了向农民进行了爱国售棉和社会主义前途教育外，还在全省二十一个重点产棉区和棉花主要集散市场，合理地调整了籽棉的收购价格。农民按照调整的价格出售籽棉，一般要比把籽棉加工后，出售皮棉的收入多。国家也可因此进一步掌握油料，保留良种，提高棉花质量。许多基层合作社采取了划片、定点、分村、约时的集体收购办法，给农民带来了很多便利，并大大提高了工作效率。
