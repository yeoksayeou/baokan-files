Public in various countries welcomes the suggestions made in the Soviet government's note of October 23 to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States regarding the speedy restoration of German unification and the safeguarding of European security.

    German Democratic Republic
    The Socialist Unity Party's organ, "Neues Deutschland," wrote in its editorial on the 26th: The German people must choose between two completely opposite paths. One is the path to war stipulated by Adenauer and the Western countries in the Paris and London Agreements. The other is the path leading to peace and the restoration of the entire German nation's sovereignty and prosperity. The new Soviet government note unfolds these bright prospects.

    "Neues Deutschland" compared the London and Paris Agreements with the Soviet government's note of October 23 this year. It wrote: The Soviet government suggests in its note that negotiations should be held on the issue of holding free all-German elections, while the measures stipulated by the Paris Agreements in this regard will create a situation in which it is impossible to hold free elections. The London and Paris Agreements stipulate the occupation of West Germany until 1998, while the Soviet government suggests that the issue of withdrawing occupying forces from both East and West Germany without delay should be resolved immediately.

    The Christian Democratic Union's organ, "Neue Zeit," published an editorial on the 26th entitled "Action Must Be Taken Now." The editorial pointed out: The attitude of the people of various countries towards the Paris Agreements and the suggestions in the Soviet government's note of October 23 this year is a major issue at present. The editorial said: We must act, we must decide the direction, we must decide the future is war or peace.

    The National Democratic Party's organ, "National-Zeitung," wrote in its editorial on the 26th: The task of the entire German people is to take the path of consultation suggested by the Soviet government's note and oppose the implementation of military treaties that threaten the people of various countries.

    "Vorwärts," "Tribüne," "Berliner Zeitung," and "Junge Welt" also published commentaries welcoming the new Soviet government note. "Junge Welt" wrote: The new suggestions made by the Soviet government in its note of October 23 to the three Western countries regarding a peaceful resolution of the German issue are in line with the vital interests of the German people, and therefore this suggestion is sincerely welcomed by all German patriots.

    The entire production staff of the "Five Eight" Machine Factory in Karl-Marx-Stadt, German Democratic Republic, passed a resolution addressed to the members of the Bonn Federal Parliament. The resolution stated: The German people did not give Adenauer the right to sign the shameful agreement in Paris. The resolution then said: "We call on the members of the Bonn Federal Parliament not to allow Adenauer to conclude war-inducing treaties that violate the people's wishes."

    Artur Bach, a representative of the Oder River Frankfurt District Organization of the German Democratic Farmers' Party, pointed out when talking about the Soviet government's note that German farmers should do their best to support the suggestions made by the Soviet government: hold a four-power foreign ministers' conference in November this year to discuss the issue of restoring German unification on a peaceful and democratic basis.

    West Germany
    The working people of West Berlin also warmly welcome the new Soviet government note and protest against the Paris Agreements to arm West Germany.

    At the same time, West German patriots are also stepping up the struggle against the Bonn government's militaristic policies. German newspaper reports say: Various West German trade unions have held conferences to support the resolution passed by the Third Congress of the German Trade Union Federation against the re-militarization of West Germany.

    A trade union meeting held at the "Tollerort" shipyard in Hamburg passed a resolution calling on workers to strive to prevent German militarists from arming themselves. The Solingen metalworkers' union passed a resolution opposing the arming of West Germany and the conscription of West German youth into the new German "Bundeswehr."

    A youth conference was held in Mannheim, where representatives of the Third Congress of the German Trade Union Federation spoke. The banners hanging in the conference venue read: "Youth want work and peace, oppose barracks and war."

    In Recklinghausen, 1,478 miners unanimously called for the conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupying forces.

    Romania
    Romania's "Scînteia" published an editorial on the 27th entitled "Striving for Peace and European Collective Security," saying: The Soviet government's note is a new constructive step taken by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions. The note fully reflects the interests and will of the people of European countries. "Scînteia" said that the Soviet government's note puts forward a concrete and feasible plan to create conditions for establishing lasting peace and safeguarding European security. The Romanian people are deeply concerned about the immediate restoration of German unification on a peaceful and democratic basis and the safeguarding of European security through the joint efforts of all European countries. They fully support the new Soviet proposals.

    Hungary
    Hungary's "Szabad Nép" published an article on the 27th entitled "Two Roads." The article wrote: The content of the Soviet note shows the Soviet Union's willingness to negotiate and its unwavering desire to promote the resolution of the German issue despite significant differences.

    "Népszava" wrote: The very important significance of the Soviet note lies in the fact that it tells millions of peace-loving people: the German issue can be agreed upon, and no international dispute is impossible to resolve through consultation. The Hungarian people support the Soviet Union's efforts to peacefully resolve the German issue with all their strength.

    The article "Collective Security or 'Strength' Policy" in "Magyar Nemzet" pointed out: The issue raised by the Soviet note is a key issue in stabilizing the international situation.

    Poland
    Poland's "Głos Pracy" published an article on the 27th saying that the Soviet proposals on the German issue clearly point out that the imperialists' claim that the militarization of Germany is the only way out is incorrect. Efforts to resolve the German issue should lead to peace, not to war. The article also said that the people of European countries, including the Polish people, will intensify their efforts to ensure that the correct Soviet proposals are victorious.

    "Życie Warszawy" on the 27th pointed out that it is now possible to bring views on the issue of a unified Germany closer together. The Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to negotiate on the German issue. The road to peace and European security is not through the "Western European Union," which stipulates the occupation of Germany until 1998, but through the unification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis and the termination of the occupation regime. The proposals in the Soviet note express this principle.

    Czechoslovakia
    Czechoslovakia's "Práce" wrote in an article entitled "Working Together for Collective Security": The Soviet Union is the only country among those who signed the Potsdam Agreement that strictly adheres to the agreement. The Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested to Western countries that negotiations be held on a peaceful resolution of the German issue in the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet government is now also suggesting free all-German elections be held in order to restore German unification. However, Western countries are beginning to create new obstacles and have embarked on a path that directly threatens European peace, as pointed out in the Soviet note. The article wrote that there is only one path to achieving European peace and security, and that is the path proposed by the Soviet Union, namely, the establishment of an all-European collective security system.

    Italy
    "L'Unità" published an article detailing the content of the Soviet note and commenting on its significance. The article said that the Soviet note pointed out two paths to the three Western countries: "Either make efforts to resolve the issue of unified Germany together with the Soviet Union, or bear the responsibility for the revival of German militarism and the continued division of Germany, which is a serious threat to European and world peace." "L'Unità" wrote: "Among these two paths, the Soviet Union has chosen the first one. It requires other countries to make a clear choice as well."

    "Avanti!" and "Nazione" also published detailed summaries of the Soviet government's note. "Nazione" emphasized that the London and Paris Agreements are in clear violation of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed during World War II and immediately after the war, because the purpose of those two treaties was primarily to oppose the revival of German militarism.

    各国公众欢迎苏联政府的新照会要求尽速恢复德国统一巩固和平
    各国公众欢迎苏联政府十月二十三日致法、英、美三国政府的照会中提出的关于尽速恢复德国的统一和保障欧洲安全的建议。
    德意志民主共和国
    统一社会党机关报“新德意志报”在二十六日的社论中写道：德国人民必须在两条完全相反的道路中选择一条。一条是阿登纳和西方国家在巴黎协定和伦敦协定中所规定的走向战争的道路。另一条是导向和平和恢复整个德意志民族的主权和繁荣的道路。苏联政府的新照会展开了这些光明的前景。
    “新德意志报”把伦敦协定和巴黎协定同苏联政府今年十月二十三日的照会作了对比。它写道：苏联政府在它的照会中建议，应该就举行全德自由选举的问题进行谈判，而巴黎协定在这方面所规定的措施将造成一种不可能举行自由选举的形势。伦敦协定和巴黎协定规定占领西德一直到一九九八年为止，而苏联政府则建议应该立即解决毫不拖延地从德国东西两部撤退占领军的问题。
    基督教民主联盟机关报“新时报”二十六日发表了一篇题为“现在必须采取行动了”的社论。社论指出：各国人民对巴黎协定和苏联政府今年十月二十三日的照会中的建议表示的态度，是当前的一个重大问题。社论说：必须行动、必须决定方向、必须决定将来是战争还是和平。
    国家民主党机关报“国民日报”在二十六日的社论中写道：全德人民的任务是走苏联政府的照会所建议的协商的道路，反对实施威胁各国人民的军事条约。
    “前进报”、“论坛报”、“柏林日报”、
  “青年世界报”也都发表评论，欢迎苏联政府的新照会。“青年世界报”写道：苏联政府在它十月二十三日致西方三个国家的照会中所提出的关于和平解决德国问题的新建议是符合德国人民的切身利益的，因而这一建议得到全体德国爱国者的衷心欢迎。
    德意志民主共和国的卡尔·马克思斯塔特的
  “五八”机器制造厂的全体生产工作人员通过了致波恩联邦议院议员的决议。决议中说：德国人民没有给阿登纳权利，让他在巴黎签订可耻的协定。决议接着说：“我们向波恩联邦议院的议员们呼吁，不要让阿登纳缔结违背人民愿望的导致战争的条约。”
    德国民主农民党奥得河畔法兰克福专区组织的代表阿图尔·巴赫在谈到苏联政府的照会时指出，德国农民应该尽力支持苏联政府提出的建议：在今年十一月举行四国外长会议，以便讨论关于在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国统一的问题。
    西　德
    柏林西区的劳动人民也热烈欢迎苏联政府的新照会，对武装西德的巴黎协定表示抗议。
    同时，西德的爱国者也加紧了反对波恩政府的军国主义政策的斗争。德国报纸消息说：西德各工会纷纷举行大会，支持德国工会联合会第三次代表大会通过的反对西德重新军国主义化的决议。
    在汉堡“托列罗尔特”造船厂举行的工会会议通过决议，号召劳动者努力斗争，不让德国军国主义分子武装起来。索林根的五金工人工会通过决议，反对武装西德和反对征召西德青年参加新的德国“国防军”。
    在曼海姆举行了青年大会，德国工会联合会第三次代表大会的代表在这次会上发了言。在大会会场上挂的标语写着：“青年要工作和和平，反对兵营和战争”。
    在勒克灵豪森，一千四百七十八名矿工一致呼吁，要求缔结和约和撤退占领军。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚的“火花报”二十七日以“争取和平和欧洲集体安全”为题发表社论说：苏联政府的照会是苏联为了缓和国际局势所采取的一个新的建设性的步骤。照会充分反映了欧洲各国人民的利益和意志。“火花报”说，苏联政府的照会提出了为树立持久和平和保障欧洲安全创造条件的具体和切实可行的计划。罗马尼亚人民深切关怀在和平民主的基础上立即恢复德国统一，以一切欧洲国家的共同努力来保障欧洲安全，他们全力支持苏联的新建议。
      匈牙利
    匈牙利的“自由人民报”二十七日刊载了以“两条道路”为题的文章，文章写道：苏联照会的内容表现出苏联愿意进行商谈，表现出苏联愿意克服重大的分歧坚定不移地愿望促进德国问题的解决。
    “人民之声报”写道：苏联照会的非常重要的意义在于：它告诉了千百万爱好和平的人们：德国问题是可以达成协议的，没有一个国际争端是不可能通过协商获得解决的。匈牙利人民竭尽全力支持苏联和平解决德国问题的努力。
      “匈牙利民族报”的文章“集体安全还是‘实力’政策”指出：苏联照会提出的问题是使国际局势稳定的关键性问题。
      波　兰
    波兰的“劳动之声报”在二十七日发表文章说，苏联关于德国问题的建议清楚地指出，帝国主义者所谓德国军国主义化是唯一出路的说法是不正确的。解决德国问题的努力应当导致和平，而不是要导致战争。文章又说，包括波兰人民在内的欧洲各国人民将加紧努力，使正确的苏联建议获得胜利。
    二十七日的“华沙生活报”指出，现在有可能使统一德国问题的看法趋于接近，苏联表示愿意就德国问题进行谈判。走向和平和欧洲安全的道路不是通过规定占领德国直到一九九八年的“西欧联盟”，而是通过在和平和民主基础上统一德国和终止占领制度。苏联照会中的建议就表达了这种原则。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克的“劳动报”在“为集体安全而共同努力”的一篇文章中写道：苏联是签订波茨坦协定各国中的唯一严格履行协定的一个国家。苏联曾多次向西方国家建议，根据波茨坦协定的精神就和平解决德国问题进行谈判。苏联政府现在也在建议，为了恢复德国统一进行全德的自由选举。然而西方国家却开始制造新的障碍，并走上了苏联照会所指出的直接威胁欧洲和平的道路。文章写道，要达到欧洲和平与安全只有一条道路可走，这条道路就是苏联所提出的，即建立全欧集体安全体系。
    意大利
      “团结报”刊载一篇文章，详细介绍了苏联照会的内容，并评述了这一照会的意义。文章说，苏联照会在西方三国面前指出了两条道路：“要就是尽力和苏联共同解决统一德国的问题，要就是承担德国军国主义复活、德国继续分裂的责任，而这对于欧洲和世界和平是严重的威胁。”“团结报”写道：“在这两条道路中，苏联选择了第一条。它要求其他国家也明确地作出选择。”
    “前进报”和“国家报”也刊载了苏联政府照会的详细摘要。“国家报”着重指出，伦敦协定和巴黎协定是明显地违背在第二次世界大战和紧接着大战之后签订的英苏条约和法苏条约的，因为那两个条约的目的首先是反对德国军国主义复活。
