    Lead Cotton Farmers to Do a Good Job in Selecting and Retaining Cotton Seeds
    It is now the season for picking cotton. Rural work cadres in all cotton-growing areas should mobilize cotton farmers to do a good job in selecting and retaining cotton seeds to ensure sufficient good seeds for cotton fields next year.
    Cotton farmers retaining their own cotton seeds has many advantages. Generally, the cotton seeds selected and retained by cotton farmers are full and, with careful preservation, have a high germination rate after sowing and ensure full seedling emergence. This is extremely important for ensuring high yield, early maturity, and high quality of cotton. Most of the cotton currently grown in China's major cotton-growing areas are excellent cotton varieties. Before the promotion of new varieties, mobilizing the masses to select and retain their own cotton seeds is the simplest and most effective way to consolidate the quality of existing good varieties.
    However, many cadres in cotton-growing areas believe that to ensure the quality of good cotton varieties, it is necessary to replace the seeds for the masses every year. They regard the practice of controlling the supply of a large quantity of cotton seeds as the direction of cotton seed work. Some cadres believe that if the masses retain their own cotton seeds, it will reduce the source of seed cotton and oil for ginneries, so they take various measures to restrict the masses from retaining seed cotton. In other areas where cotton farmers are accustomed to retaining seeds, some cadres believe that the masses will retain seeds themselves and do not provide guidance. Under these circumstances, the quantity of cotton seeds selected by farmers themselves is decreasing year by year, and the quantity of cotton seeds that supply and marketing cooperatives bear is increasing year by year. When cotton seed preparation is insufficient, supply and marketing cooperatives have no choice but to supply cotton seeds of poor quality as cotton seeds. This not only consumes a lot of funds and manpower but also reduces the quality of cotton, resulting in a reduction in cotton production. This phenomenon must not be allowed to continue.
    In order to mobilize cotton farmers to do a good job in selecting and retaining cotton seeds, all localities must correct the above-mentioned incorrect practices, strengthen the organization and leadership of this work, and provide farmers with various conveniences for retaining their own cotton seeds. The Government Administration Council clearly pointed out in the "Order on Implementing the Planned Purchase of Cotton": "Supply and marketing cooperatives should provide convenience for processing seed cotton used by cotton farmers for seed retention." Of course, we should also educate farmers not to retain too much seed cotton in the name of retaining cotton seeds, which will affect the state's unified purchase of cotton and oil.
    In order to ensure that there are enough high-quality cotton seeds next year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various localities must also prepare a part of high-quality cotton seeds in the business of managing means of production to meet the needs of disaster-stricken areas and farmers who lack cotton seeds. Newly established and planned agricultural producers' cooperatives should also require farmers who join the cooperative and are preparing to join the cooperative to bring the selected and retained cotton seeds to the cooperative to ensure that the new cooperative has enough cotton seeds for sowing next year.

### 领导棉农作好选留棉种工作

    领导棉农作好选留棉种工作
    目前正是收摘棉花的季节。各棉区的农村工作干部，应发动棉农作好选留棉种的工作，保证明年棉田播种时有足够的良种。
    棉农自留棉种有很多好处。一般棉农选留的棉种籽粒饱满，加以保存精细，因而播种后发芽率高，出苗齐全。这对保证棉花的丰产、早熟、质优都有极大关系。我国各主要棉区目前种植的棉花，一般都是优良棉种，在没有推广新的品种以前，发动群众自己选留棉种，也是巩固现有良种品质的一个最简便和最有效的办法。
    但是，不少棉区干部认为要保证良种棉花的品质，就必须年年给群众换种。他们把控制大量棉种进行供应的作法，当作棉种工作的方向。有些干部认为群众自留棉种，就会减少轧花厂的籽棉来源和油料来源，因而采取各种办法，限制群众自留籽棉。在另外一些棉农习惯留种的地区，有些干部又认为群众自己会留种，而不加以领导。在这些情况下，农民自选棉种的数量逐年缩减，供销合作社负担供应棉种的数量逐年增加。在棉种准备不足的时候，供销合作社又只好以质量差的棉籽当作棉种供应，这样，不但耗费了大量资金和人力，同时也降低了棉花的品质，造成了棉花的减产。这种现象不能让它再继续下去了。
    为了发动棉农作好选留棉种的工作，各地必须纠正上面说的那些不正确的作法，加强对这一工作的组织和领导，给农民自留棉种以各种方便。政务院在“关于实行棉花计划收购的命令”中明确指出：“对棉农留种用的籽棉，供销合作社应给以加工的便利。”当然我们也应该教育农民不要以自留棉种为名，过多地留存籽棉，影响国家对棉花和油料的统购工作。
    为了保证明年有足够的优良棉种，各地供销合作社在经营生产资料的业务中，还必须准备一部分优良棉种，以便供应受灾地区和缺乏棉种的农民的需要。新建和准备建立的农业生产合作社，也应要求入社和准备入社的农民，带着选留的棉种入社，保证新建社明年播种时有足够的棉种。
