The Peaceful Reunification of Korea Should Be Resolved Swiftly
——Commemorating the Fourth Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' Entry into the War in Korea

Today marks the fourth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into the war in Korea. This is a day of pride and glory for the Chinese people, and a day that all peace-loving people will never forget.

In the past four years, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, with the support of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, won the victory in the just war against American aggression, secured the Korean armistice, and continued to strive to uphold the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and seek a solution to the peaceful reunification of Korea.

All the facts prove that this great achievement is a significant contribution to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world.

In June 1950, the United States government launched the war of aggression against Korea, while simultaneously occupying our country's Taiwan Province and beginning to interfere in the war in Indochina. The armed intervention and war threats against our country and the grave provocations against the cause of peace in the Far East and the world that the United States carried out from these three fronts first met with a shameful defeat on the Korean front. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side and won the victory of the Korean armistice, shattering the American imperialists' arrogant plan to annex the whole of Korea and then invade Northeast China, defending the peace and security of China and Korea and the Far East, and opening the way for the restoration of peace in Indochina. With the example of their own victory, the people of China and Korea demonstrated a truth to the people of the world: the imperialist plots of aggressive war must be defeated and can be defeated.

The Chinese people are peace-loving and have always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiation. The reason why the Chinese people launched the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement and dispatched volunteers to fight abroad four years ago was precisely for this noble purpose. After the Korean armistice, the Chinese people firmly maintained that the Korean Armistice Agreement must be thoroughly implemented, that all foreign troops must withdraw from Korea, and that the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea must be resolved on the principle of the Korean people handling their own affairs. The Chinese people have been making unremitting efforts for this. In order to convene a Korean political conference, the representatives of Korea and China made sincere efforts in the bilateral talks with the US representatives. However, the US representatives unilaterally and arrogantly terminated the bilateral talks, making it impossible to convene the political conference. At the Geneva Conference discussing the Korean issue, the delegation of the People's Republic of China, together with the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Soviet Union, put forward a series of fair, reasonable, and practical proposals to seek an agreement to establish a peaceful, democratic, unified, and independent Korea. The reason why the meeting on the Korean issue was interrupted at that time was not because the Geneva Conference had no possibility of reaching a consensus on a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but because the US government and its puppet Syngman Rhee clique refused to negotiate, fearing to reach any agreement. However, the governments of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union still believed that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue had not been removed from the agenda.

On September 23 this year, Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our country, in his government work report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, put forward specific proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's report said: "The Geneva Conference did not reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue due to the US government and the Syngman Rhee clique's unreasonable policy of sabotage. But the Korean issue has not been removed from the agenda. Peace-loving countries and people of the world cannot tolerate the long-term unresolved nature of the Korean issue. We believe that a conference should be convened, following the example of the Geneva Conference in resolving the Indochina issue, with the participation of neutral Asian countries to re-discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so as to resolve the peaceful reunification of Korea swiftly, based on the principle of respecting the national rights of the Korean people and benefiting the guarantee of peace in Asia and the world." Subsequently, the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew seven divisions from Korea. This action demonstrated the consistent stance of the Chinese people in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and was in line with the common aspirations of peace-loving countries and people of the world.

Recently, the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union held talks and issued a joint declaration, unanimously believing that: "The fact that Korea is still divided into two parts violates the natural desire of the Korean people to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Korean state. This situation is abnormal. Given that the unification of Korea is one of the important tasks, and that the resolution of this task is of great significance for consolidating peace in the Far East, the two governments believe that it is necessary to convene a conference to discuss the Korean issue in the near future, with the broad participation of the countries concerned."

The proposal put forward successively by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's report and the joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments has received widespread sympathy and support from the Korean people and public opinion in various countries. However, the US government is still hostile to the peaceful aspirations of the world's people and is unwilling to convene a conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Although the US State Department spokesman feigned to indicate at a press conference on September 23 that the United States was prepared to re-discuss ways to resolve the Korean issue, he hinted that he insisted that the United Nations, one of the belligerent parties in Korea, should supervise the Korean elections, and wanted to re-propose this absurd "condition" that had long been untenable at the Geneva Conference, in order to perfunctorily deal with the suggestions of China and the Soviet Union. This unreasonable attitude of the United States in continuing to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is also reflected in President Eisenhower's speech on October 20. In this speech that Eisenhower made to deceive American voters, he tried his best to prove that the United States harbored peaceful intentions and talked about the United States being willing to strive to seek solutions to the Korean issue and other international issues; however, in addition to shirking the responsibility of the United States for unreasonably interrupting the Korean issue meeting at the Geneva Conference, he did not put forward any suggestions at all, and avoided mentioning the suggestions of the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the convening of a meeting to discuss the Korean issue.

Can this attitude of the US government be regarded as truly willing to consider the peaceful aspirations of the American and other peoples, and have the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Korean issue? The current peaceful rhetoric of the US government is not supported by any practical actions. The various activities of the US government since the Geneva Conference prove that it is keen on continuing to deepen and expand the division of Korea and maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, in order to echo its intensified adventurous activities in the Far East. The United States is preparing, according to the agreement reached in Washington and Syngman Rhee in September, to allocate 700 million US dollars in the current fiscal year to help the Syngman Rhee clique equip a ten-division reserve force, expand Syngman Rhee's air and naval forces, and establish a series of munitions factories. The United States openly advocates and instigates the Syngman Rhee clique to conspire to "dissolve" the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and constantly violates the armistice agreement, sending armed agents to invade the Korean demilitarized zone and the rear of the Korean People's Army to carry out disturbances. The United States is also actively planning to organize a Northeast Asian military alliance of Japanese reactionaries, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to link it with the already pieced together Southeast Asian aggressive group, forming an encirclement of the People's Republic of China to undermine peace and security in the Far East.

The US ruling clique's continued conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice has further aggravated the seriousness of the Korean situation. This situation shows that the long-term unresolved nature of the Korean issue is a threat to peace in the Far East and the world; therefore, convening a conference with the broad participation of the countries concerned to discuss the Korean issue and swiftly resolve the peaceful reunification of Korea is extremely important. The Chinese people will continue to work together with the Korean people and the peace and democracy forces headed by the Soviet Union to safeguard the Korean armistice and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue to the end. For this great task of striving for peace, the Chinese People's Volunteers should always maintain a high degree of vigilance, more closely guard the position with the Korean People's Army, and prevent any invasion and provocative actions from the other side. All the Chinese people will continue the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, to do their best to help the heroic Korean people heal the wounds of war, and to complete the three-year construction plan to strive for the peace, unification, independence, and strengthening of the democratic base of Korea. Our cause of striving for peace is just, and we will surely be victorious.

    应该从速解决朝鲜的和平统一问题
    ——纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战四周年
    今天是中国人民志愿军出国作战四周年纪念。这是中国人民引为骄傲和光荣的日子，也是一切爱好和平的人民永志不忘的日子。
    过去的四年间，中国人民志愿军曾经同朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民在一起，在以苏联为首的和平民主力量的支持下，赢得了反对美国侵略的正义战争的胜利，争取了朝鲜停战的实现，并继续为维护朝鲜停战协定的实施、谋求朝鲜和平统一问题的解决而坚持奋斗。
  一切的事实证明：这一伟大的功绩，对保卫远东及世界和平的事业，是一个重大的贡献。
    一九五○年六月，美国政府发动了侵略朝鲜战争，同时侵占了我国的台湾省，并开始了对印度支那战争的干涉。美国从这三条战线上对我国进行的武装干涉和战争威胁和对远东及世界和平事业的严重挑衅，首先在朝鲜战线上遭到了可耻的失败。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战、争取了朝鲜停战的胜利，粉碎了美国帝国主义并吞全部朝鲜并进而侵略我国东北的狂妄计划，保卫了中朝两国及远东的和平和安全，并为争取印度支那和平的恢复打开了道路。中朝两国人民以自己的胜利的榜样，向世界人民昭示了一个真理：帝国主义的侵略战争阴谋是必须击败而且是能够被击败的。
    中国人民是爱好和平的，是一贯主张以和平协商方式解决国际争端的。四年前中国人民所以发动抗美援朝运动，派遣志愿军出国作战，正是为了这个崇高的目的。朝鲜停战以后，中国人民坚决主张朝鲜停战协定必须彻底实施，一切外国军队必须从朝鲜撤退，朝鲜的和平统一问题必须在朝鲜人民自己处理自己问题的原则上谋求解决。中国人民为此进行着不懈的斗争。为了召开朝鲜政治会议，朝中代表在与美方代表举行的双方会谈中，作了真诚的努力。但是美国代表却蛮横地片面终止了双方会谈，使政治会议不能召开。在日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题时，中华人民共和国代表团同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏联代表团一起，为谋求达成协议，以建立一个和平、民主、统一和独立的朝鲜，提出了一系列公平合理和切实可行的建议。当时朝鲜问题的会议之所以陷于中断，并非由于日内瓦会议没有可能对和平解决朝鲜问题取得一致意见，而是由于美国政府和它的傀儡李承晚集团拒绝进行协商，害怕达成任何协议。但朝、中、苏三国政府依然认为，和平解决朝鲜问题并没有从议程上抹掉。
     今年九月二十三日，我国周恩来总理兼外交部长在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中，提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的具体建议。周恩来总理兼外交部长的报告说：“日内瓦会议由于美国政府和李承晚集团的蛮横无理的破坏政策，没有就和平解决朝鲜问题达成协议。但是朝鲜问题并没有从议程上抹掉。世界爱好和平的国家和人民不能容许朝鲜问题长期悬而不决。我们认为应当仿照日内瓦会议解决印度支那问题的榜样，召开有亚洲中立国家参加的重新讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的会议，以便根据尊重朝鲜人民的民族权利和有利于保障亚洲和世界和平的原则，从速解决朝鲜的和平统一问题。”接着，中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤退了七个师，这一行动表示了中国人民争取和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯立场，并且符合于世界爱好和平的国家和人民的共同愿望。
    最近，中华人民共和国政府和苏联政府举行会谈，发表了联合宣言，一致认为：“朝鲜至今仍然分裂成为两部分，是违反了朝鲜人民要求建立一个统一的、爱好和平的、民主的朝鲜国家的自然愿望的，这种情况，是不正常的。鉴于朝鲜的统一是重要任务之一，而这一任务的解决对巩固远东和平具有巨大意义，两国政府认为有必要在最近的将来召开讨论朝鲜问题的会议，由有关各国广泛参加。”
    周恩来总理兼外长的报告和中苏两国政府联合宣言先后提出的这个主张，得到了朝鲜人民和各国公众舆论的广泛同情和支持。但是，美国政府却仍然与世界人民的和平愿望为敌，不愿召开会议来和平解决朝鲜问题。美国国务院发言人在九月二十三日的记者招待会上，虽然假意表示美国准备重新讨论解决朝鲜问题的办法，但他却暗示坚持要由朝鲜交战一方的联合国来监督朝鲜选举，想重新提出这种在日内瓦会议上早就站不住脚的荒谬“条件”，来搪塞中苏两国的建议。美国这种继续采取堵塞和平解决朝鲜问题的无理态度，同样表现在美国总统艾森豪威尔在十月二十日发表的演说中。艾森豪威尔在他为欺骗美国选民而发的这篇演说中，竭力企图证明美国抱有和平的意图，并谈到了美国将愿努力寻求解决朝鲜问题及其他国际问题；但是，他除了推卸美国在日内瓦会议上无理中断朝鲜问题会议的责任以外，根本没有提出任何建议，对中苏两国政府关于召开讨论朝鲜问题的会议的建议，也避而不谈。
    美国政府的这种态度，难道能够被认为是真正愿意考虑美国及各国人民的和平愿望，具有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意吗？美国政府目前的和平言论，是得不到任何实际行动的印证的。美国政府在日内瓦会议以后的种种活动证明，它所热中从事的是继续加深和扩大朝鲜的分裂局面，保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，以与它加紧进行的远东冒险活动相呼应。美国正在根据九月间在华盛顿和李承晚会谈所取得的协议，准备在目前会计年度中拨出七亿美元来帮助李承晚集团装备十师后备部队，并扩充李承晚的海空军，和建立一系列的军火工厂。美国公然主张和唆使李承晚集团阴谋“解散”中立国监察委员会，并不断地违反停战协定，派遣武装特务侵入朝鲜非军事区和朝鲜人民军后方进行扰乱，美国还正在继续向南朝鲜运入增援性军事物资。同时，美国还积极策划组织日本反动派、李承晚集团和蒋介石卖国集团的东北亚军事联盟，企图把它与已经拼凑的东南亚侵略集团联结起来，形成对中华人民共和国的包围，以破坏远东的和平和安全。
    美国统治集团继续进行破坏朝鲜停战的种种阴谋活动，使朝鲜局势的严重性有加无已。这一局势，说明了朝鲜问题的长期悬而不决，是对远东及世界和平的威胁；因而，召开有关各国广泛参加的讨论朝鲜问题的会议，从速解决朝鲜的和平统一问题，是十分重要的。 中国人民将继续同朝鲜人民及以苏联为首的和平民主力量一起，共同为维护朝鲜停战，争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底。为了这个争取和平的伟大任务，中国人民志愿军应该经常保持高度的警惕，更紧密地和朝鲜人民军一起坚守阵地，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和挑衅行动。全中国人民将继续抗美援朝运动，来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，来尽力帮助英雄的朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，完成为争取朝鲜的和平、统一、独立和加强民主基地而进行的三年建设计划。我们争取和平的事业是正义的，我们一定能够胜利。
