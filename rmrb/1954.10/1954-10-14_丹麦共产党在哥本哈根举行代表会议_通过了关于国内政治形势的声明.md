Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, October 9th: The Danish Communist Party Congress opened on the 8th. Attending the meeting were representatives from grassroots and regional organizations, municipal committees, and the Party Central Committee. Representatives from the Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish Communist Parties also participated in the meeting.

    Danish Communist Party Chairman Larsen delivered a political report at the meeting. In his report, he stated that the Danish currency crisis and the ensuing government crisis were not merely due to economic factors. The crisis primarily stemmed from the policies implemented since Denmark's participation in the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    Larsen's report placed great emphasis on the issue of West German remilitarization. He said that the current moment is a critical test for all forces. The nation must decide whether to agree to the revival of German militarism, and whether to allow German troops to "protect" Denmark once again.

    Larsen said that only those who have forgotten everything and learned nothing would support the plan for arming West Germany as formulated in the London Conference. This plan poses a deadly danger to European peace and harbors a threat to Germany's neighbors.

    Larsen said: German militarism is rearing its head again. Once German militarists feel they have sufficient strength, all the "restrictions" devised for them will be discarded. West Germany will once again become the dominant military power in Western Europe, ruled by a military clique imbued with a fanatical desire for revenge, seeking retribution against both East and West.

    Larsen said: Now, Denmark must speak its mind. If it says "no," it will provide an opportunity and buy time to reopen negotiations on the German question.

    Larsen then elaborated on the Soviet government's proposal for a European collective security system and the proposals made by Molotov in his speech at the Berlin celebration. He emphasized that collective security is the only guarantee for avoiding a new war, and any attempt to rearm German revanchists is against the will of the Danish people.

    In closing his report, Larsen stressed that the Danish people are capable of resolving all current difficulties by implementing a sensible trade policy based on equality and mutual benefit, reducing military spending, and pursuing a policy of easing international tensions and preventing the revival of German militarism. Larsen said that now, as during the Resistance movement, the Danish Communist Party must fulfill its responsibility – leading the people's struggle, uniting all honest Danes into a unified national front, and cooperating fraternally with the world's fighters for peace and freedom to defeat the forces of war and ensure the victory of peace in Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, October 11th: The Danish Communist Party Congress, which began on October 8th, concluded on the 10th.

    The Congress adopted a declaration on the domestic political situation. The declaration pointed out that the currency crisis undermining the Danish economy can be overcome by reducing military expenditure, shortening the term of military service, improving export conditions to Western countries, expanding export volumes to Eastern European countries, and curbing currency speculation.

    The declaration called on the Danish people to support these demands. The declaration stated: "Now, more than ever, a common struggle is needed. Everyone now understands that all the funds extorted from the people as military expenses each year are actually used to help arm Germany and revive German militarism."

    丹麦共产党在哥本哈根举行代表会议
    通过了关于国内政治形势的声明
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根九日讯：丹麦共产党代表会议八日开幕。出席会议的有：各基层组织和地区组织的代表，各市委员会和党中央委员会的代表。参加会议的还有瑞典、挪威、芬兰共产党的代表。
    丹麦共产党主席拉荪在会议上作政治报告。他在报告中说：引起丹麦通货危机以及接踵而来的政府危机的，不只是经济方面的原因，这危机首先是从丹麦参加马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约以来所执行的政策的危机。
    拉荪的报告非常重视西德重新军国主义化的问题。他说，现在是对各种力量进行严重考验的关头了。国家将要决定：同意不同意德国军国主义复活，同意不同意丹麦再让德国的军队来“保护”。
    拉荪说，只有那些已经忘掉了一切并且没有得到丝毫教训的人才会支持伦敦会议所制定的武装西德的计划。这个计划对欧洲和平有致命的危险，并蕴藏着对德国邻国的威胁。
    拉荪说：德国军国主义又在抬头了。一当德国军国主义者感到自己有足够的力量时，一切为他们设想出来的“限制”就会被扔到一边。西德将重新成为在西欧占控制地位的军事强国，它将由一个浸透了疯狂的复仇思想的军事集团来统治，它要对东方和西方复仇。
    拉荪说：现在，丹麦应当讲自己的话了。如果它说个“不”字，那么就会提供一种可能性，并且可以争取时间来重开德国问题的谈判。
    拉荪接着详细谈到苏联政府关于欧洲集体安全体系的建议，以及莫洛托夫在柏林庆祝会上演说中所提出的建议。他着重指出，集体安全是避免新战争的唯一保障，重新武装德国复仇主义者的任何企图都是违反丹麦人民的意志的。
    拉荪在报告结束时强调指出，只要执行平等互利的明智的贸易政策，只要缩减军费，只要执行缓和国际紧张局势和不让德国军国主义复活的政策，丹麦人民是能够解决当前的一切困难的。拉荪说，现在和在抵抗运动期间一样，丹麦共产党应当履行它的责任——领导人民的斗争，把所有正直的丹麦人团结到统一的民族阵线中，以和世界各国争取和平和自由的战士进行兄弟般的合作，打垮战争力量，使和平事业在欧洲取得胜利。
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根十一日讯：十月八日开始举行的丹麦共产党代表会议已经在十日闭幕了。
    代表会议通过了关于国内政治形势的声明。声明指出，破坏丹麦经济的货币危机是能够克服的，克服的办法是削减军事开支、缩短服兵役的期限、改善对西方国家的输出条件、扩大对东欧国家的输出额以及制止货币投机。
    声明号召丹麦人民支持这些要求。声明写道：“现在比任何时候都更加需要共同的斗争。现在大家都明白，每年向人民勒索到的作为军事费用的所有款项，实际上是用于帮助武装德国和复活德国军国主义的。”
