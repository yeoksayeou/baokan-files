    Henan Province Revolutionary Martyrs' Families and Revolutionary Military Personnel's Families
    Participate in Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations to Develop Production and Improve Living Standards
    The lives of revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary military personnel's families in Henan Province who have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations are improving daily. The number of revolutionary martyrs' families, revolutionary military personnel's families, and demobilized construction soldiers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations in Henan Province accounts for more than 50% of the total number of martyrs' and military families. After participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, they gradually overcame various difficulties, increased production, and improved their lives. Zhang Dongling, a second-class disabled revolutionary soldier from Zhangjiuzhai Township, Qingfeng County, has only one leg. However, thanks to the unified management of the cooperative, which made the best use of his talents, he worked more than 30 workdays in the first half of this year and can receive about 300 jin of grain. Dai Chang'an, a military family member from Xiaonanzhuang, Jiyuan County, has eight family members, but only two female laborers. Before joining the cooperative, although farmers tilled part of their land, they still faced significant production difficulties. After joining the cooperative in 1953, the two female laborers worked 419 workdays and earned a total of 6,220 jin of grain for the year, an increase of 880 jin compared to before joining the cooperative. Xu Hai, a military family member from Xijiang Village, Sixth District, Anyang County, harvested a total of more than 3,600 jin of grain this year, more than double what he harvested before joining the cooperative. After having enough to eat, he also sold 800 jin of surplus grain.
    All revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary military personnel's families who have been organized have seen significant improvements in their lives due to the development of production. In Zhuanqiao Township, Suiping County, there are 64 martyrs' and military families, 89% of whom have been organized. From 1951 to 1953, they increased their livestock by 25 head and built 38 new houses. After martyrs' and military families participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the organized peasants promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, ensuring that their illnesses, house repairs, temporary living difficulties, and the water and firewood needs of the elderly, widowed, and orphaned were promptly taken care of.

    河南省革命烈士家属和革命军人家属
    参加互助合作组织发展生产改善生活
    河南省参加互助合作组织的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属，生活正日益改善。河南省革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织的户数，约占烈属、军属总户数的百分之五十以上。他们参加互助合作组织以后，逐步克服了各种困难，增加了生产，提高了生活。清丰县张旧寨乡二等革命残废军人张东岭，只有一条腿，由于社里统一经营，使人尽其才，在今年上半年作了三十多个劳动日，可以分得约三百多斤粮食。济源县小南庄军属戴长安，家中八口人，只有两个女劳动力，入社以前，虽然由农民代耕一部分土地，但生产困难仍然很大。一九五三年入社以后，两个女劳动力做了四百一十九个劳动日，全年共收入粮食六千二百二十斤，比入社前增加了八百八十斤。安阳县六区西蒋村军属许海，今年共净收三千六百多斤粮食，比入社前增加一倍以上，除够吃外还卖了八百斤余粮。
    凡是组织起来的革命烈士家属和革命军人家属，由于生产的发展，生活都有了显著提高。遂平县砖桥乡共有烈属和军属六十四户，百分之八十九都已组织起来，他们在一九五一年到一九五三年增加了二十五头牲口，盖新房三十八间。烈属和军属参加互助合作组织以后，由于组织起来的农民发扬了互助友爱精神，使他们的疾病、房屋修建、临时生活困难和孤寡户的吃水、烧柴等问题，也都能获得及时的照顾。（新华社）
