Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: Aizawa Shigeaki, head of the Japanese Workers' Delegation and Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, issued the following statement before leaving Beijing:

    Dear Chinese comrades!

    On behalf of the 35 members of the Japanese Workers' Delegation, I extend my greetings to you.

    Invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, our Japanese Workers' Delegation traveled through Italy and France in Europe to come to China and gloriously participate in the celebration of the glorious fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Afterwards, we visited factories, farms, schools, residences, and various social facilities in Beijing, Shanghai, and the Northeast, and saw the actual situation of the new China in a concrete way. At the same time, we frankly and seriously exchanged opinions with people from all walks of life on various issues. I express my deep gratitude here.

    Although the time was short, we have personally experienced your vigorous will to carry out construction, and at the same time, from concrete examples, we have learned that workers and peasants are overcoming many difficulties with full confidence and moving forward.

    This experience of ours will be a great contribution to the Japanese people's understanding of the new facts of China and we are confident that the friendship and amity between China and Japan will advance by leaps and bounds.

    We are very pleased that we have reached a consensus on the point that we should strive for the solidarity of all Asian workers, regardless of their ideology. Let us all work together so that representatives of all Asian workers can gather together as soon as possible.

    We once again express to the peace-loving Chinese comrades the Japanese working class's confidence in fighting against the anti-Japanese forces of the United States and Japan and building a peaceful Japan by relying on its own strength. To this end, we also hope that Chinese comrades will further assist us in many issues such as Sino-Japanese trade.

    Now, we are about to leave China, and we express our deep gratitude for the warm welcome and various conveniences you have given us since the Japanese Workers' Delegation came to China. At the same time, we express our heartfelt blessings to the Chinese comrades who are moving towards a bright future.

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    Long live the friendly unity between the workers of China and Japan!

    Long live world peace!

              Aizawa Shigeaki, Head of the Japanese Workers' Delegation

    日本工人代表团团长离京前夕发表声明
    【新华社二十五日讯】日本工人代表团团长、日本工会总评议会副主席相泽重明在离开北京前夕，发表声明如下：亲爱的中国同志们！
    我代表日本工人代表团三十五人向诸位致意。
    这次我们日本工人代表团应中华全国总工会的邀请，遥经欧洲的意大利和法国，来到中国，光荣地参加了中华人民共和国的光辉的建国五周年国庆典礼。之后，我们又在北京、上海和东北各地，参观了工厂、农场、学校、住宅以及各种社会设施，具体地看到了新中国的实际情况；同时我们和各方面人士就各种问题直率地认真地交换了意见，我在这里表示深深的感谢。
    时日虽然短暂，但我们已切身体会到你们进行建设的旺盛的意志，同时从具体的事例中，知道了工人和农民正满怀信心地克服许多困难，向前迈进。
    我们的这一体验，对于日本人民认识中国的新的事实，将是一个巨大的贡献。并确信中日两国的亲善和友好将飞跃地前进。
    我们对于应该不问思想如何，都要努力于所有亚洲工人的团结这一点，意见已经一致，这是我们很感高兴的。我们大家都来努力，以便尽早地使全亚洲工人代表欢聚在一堂。
    我们再一次向爱好和平的中国同志们表明日本工人阶级与美日反动势力进行斗争、依靠自己的力量建设和平日本的信心。为此，同时希望中国同志们在中日贸易问题等许多问题上进一步给我们以协助。
    现在，我们就要离开中国，对你们自日本工人代表团来到中国以后，所给予我们的热烈欢迎和各种便利，表示深深的感谢。同时我们对向着光明前途迈进的中国同志们表示衷心的祝福。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    中日两国工人友好团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
              日本工人代表团团长
                            相泽重明
                一九五四年十月二十二日
