Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: According to TASS, Polish and Czechoslovak newspapers published commentaries expressing support for the Soviet government's proposal in its October 23rd notes to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States regarding convening a meeting of the four foreign ministers.

The Polish "People's Tribune" on the 25th wrote in an article entitled "Striving for European Security": The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of defending and strengthening peace, and a policy of international cooperation. The Soviet note is a manifestation and proof of this policy. The Soviet note puts forward new proposals aimed at promoting the settlement of disputes that are unsettling Europe and the world. Those who opposed the proposal to conclude a European collective security treaty are still opposing this proposal because they are unwilling to create conditions conducive to solving the German question.

The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet note points out a practical way to solve the German question and other important issues.

The Czechoslovak "Red Right Daily" commented on the Soviet note on the 25th, saying: Historical experience proves that the revival of German militarism is fraught with the danger of causing new wars in Europe. On the other hand, the peaceful reunification of Germany and the establishment of a collective security system proposed by the Soviet Union will help strengthen and guarantee European peace.

The newspaper said: In its note to the Soviet government on September 10th, the French government insisted that West Germany's incorporation into the so-called "defense system" of Western Europe would never threaten European security. However, the fact that the French government asked Britain to provide guarantees against German militarism shows that the French government itself does not believe this statement.

The newspaper finally stated that the Czechoslovak people oppose the Paris Agreement to arm West Germany and support the Soviet Union's efforts to convene a new meeting of the four foreign ministers.

Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: According to TASS, Paris, October 26th: Paris newspapers widely commented on the Soviet note to Western countries on October 23rd.

French bourgeois newspapers, worried about the influence of the Soviet proposal on public opinion, desperately clamored that there was "nothing new" in the Soviet note.

Individual bourgeois newspapers, such as "Le Figaro," concluded from this that "since there is nothing new, negotiations with the Soviet Union cannot have a good start." The socialist newspaper "Le Populaire" insisted that negotiations with the Soviet Union on guaranteeing European security were not inconsistent with the militarization of West Germany.

Some other newspapers, however, held a different view. "Combat" wrote: "Negotiations with the East should be resumed, because the future of peaceful coexistence between the two directly opposing blocs depends on the outcome of such negotiations, that is, either achieving peace or having to be content with armed peace, the latter of which is not very optimistic. France should take the initiative in resuming such negotiations, because France has a greater stake in maintaining peace—the conditions for peaceful coexistence—than other countries."

"Liberation" condemned Mendès-France's plan to arm Bonn's revanchists. The newspaper compared the Soviet proposal in the note on the peaceful settlement of the German question and the organization of a European collective security system with Mendès-France's policy. The newspaper wrote: While making these proposals, the Soviet Union also issued three warnings: 1. Once the London Agreement is implemented, the hope of reunifying Germany will disappear for a long time. 2. These agreements are in direct violation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty. 3. It is impossible to conduct serious negotiations on disarmament at the United Nations on the one hand, and to implement the arming of West Germany on the other... The newspaper emphasized that the question is very clear: "Either negotiate to find a broad solution to the problem, thereby making the arming of Germany unnecessary, or agree to arm West Germany and stifle the opportunity for negotiations that are just beginning."

"L'Humanité" published the full text of the Soviet note to the three Western countries. "L'Humanité" called on the French people to do everything possible to make the members of the National Assembly reject the Paris Agreement and support the Soviet government's proposal for negotiations between the countries concerned to resolve the German question and establish a European collective security system.

Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: According to TASS, London: British bourgeois newspapers have all published news of the Soviet note of October 23rd, and some newspapers have also published commentaries.

The Labor Party's "Daily Herald" said: Negotiations with the Soviet Union should be held at the same time as preparations for the ratification of the Paris Agreement.

Other bourgeois newspapers, on the one hand, demanded that the Soviet note be taken seriously, pointing out that it should not be hastily rejected as a basis for further consultation; but on the other hand, they put forward a viewpoint—first ratify the Paris Agreement, and then hold negotiations with the Soviet Union. These bourgeois newspapers are gambling on negotiating from a position of "strength." "The Times" attempted to justify this claim. It acknowledged that the Soviet note "again presented to all serious and enthusiastic peace seekers the either/or danger in the German question," and believed that "as long as Germany remains divided, the European question cannot be considered finally resolved." However, at the same time, it made a completely unfounded conclusion, saying that "the dangers in Russia's solution are much greater." The "Yorkshire Post" wrote: "Today we are able to negotiate from a position of strength." However, the newspaper also understood that such a policy might not succeed. It therefore also said: "It cannot be certain that future developments will be in our favor."

Some newspapers also argued that the Soviet Union should fulfill certain "preconditions" before starting negotiations. For example, the "Western Mail and South Wales News" quoted diplomatic sources in Paris as saying that "the West believes that in order to convene a meeting, a treaty ending the occupation of Austria must be signed and free elections must be held in all of Germany." But it should be known that the Soviet government specifically proposed discussing these issues in the note.

Bourgeois newspapers repeatedly reiterated the old tune that the purpose of the Soviet note was to create obstacles to the ratification of the Paris Agreement.

The reason why these newspapers said this is obviously because they could not find sufficient reasons to oppose the Soviet proposal. And people of all countries are waiting for the Western countries to make a substantial response to the Soviet proposal aimed at guaranteeing European peace and security.

Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: According to TASS, New York, October 26th: The American press widely commented on the Soviet government's note of October 23rd.

American propaganda tools expressed the views of the American rulers, believing that the Soviet proposal was a threat to American aggression plans, and therefore tried their best to advocate rejecting the Soviet government's note.

The Associated Press Washington reporter reported that the U.S. State Department has not yet commented on the Soviet note, but it is speculated that the United States, Britain, and France will reject the Soviet request to convene a meeting of the four foreign ministers in November.

However, the American press knows that clearly rejecting the Soviet initiative will arouse dissatisfaction among the world's public, so they argued that, in general, Western countries do not refuse to negotiate with the Soviet Union.

Associated Press Washington correspondent Hightower wrote: "Diplomatic officials say that the Western countries' plan to arm West Germany will provide a new basis of strength for negotiating with Russia on the European issue. Therefore, it is believed that after the new plan is approved, it may be possible to hold another meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss the issue of German reunification, the Austrian treaty, and related issues. It is reported that Western leaders, including Secretary of State Dulles, have agreed that they should not hold meetings with Russia before obtaining approval."

American newspapers also expressed their concern that the Soviet note might hinder the implementation of the West German rearmament plan. "The New York Times" said that the Soviet proposal on holding free elections in Germany may have a serious impact on the plan to rearm West Germany.

"The New York Herald Tribune" Paris correspondent Cook urged Western countries to act recklessly and "not interrupt or change" their plan to arm West Germany "because of the Soviet note or other distractions."

"The New York Herald Tribune" in an editorial linked the Soviet note with the opposition to the Paris Agreement in France and West Germany. The newspaper said, "French parliamentarians firmly advocate holding new talks with Russia before German rearmament is realized; the German Social Democrats accuse Prime Minister Adenauer of sacrificing German unity in order to obtain an alliance with the West."

    波捷等国报纸支持苏联建议召开四国会议
    美国的宣传工具认为苏联建议是对美国侵略计划的威胁
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社讯：波兰和捷克斯洛伐克报纸发表评论表示支持苏联政府在十月二十三日致法、英、美三国政府中关于召开四国外长会议的建议。
    二十五日的波兰“人民论坛报”在一篇题为“争取欧洲安全”的文章中写道：苏联始终如一地奉行保卫和加强和平的政策，奉行国际合作的政策。苏联照会就是这种政策的表现和证明，苏联的照会提出了目的在于促进解决使欧洲和全世界不安的争端的新建议。那些反对缔结欧洲集体安全条约的建议的人们目前仍然在反对这个建议，因为他们不愿意创造有助于解决德国问题的条件。
    这家报纸指出，苏联照会指出了一条解决德国问题和其他重要问题的切实可行的道路。
    捷克斯洛伐克的“红色权利报”二十五日就苏联的照会发表评论说：历史经验证明，复活德国军国主义是充满了在欧洲引起新战争的危险的。另一方面，苏联所建议的和平地重新统一德国和建立集体安全体系却将有助于加强和保障欧洲和平。
    这家报纸说：法国政府在九月十日致苏联政府的照会中硬说，西德并入西欧的所谓的“防务体系”决不会威胁欧洲的安全。然而法国政府要求英国提供保证防止德国军国主义的事实说明，法国政府自己也不相信这种说法。
    这家报纸最后表示，捷克斯洛伐克人民反对武装西德的巴黎协定，并支持苏联为召开新的四国外长会议而作的努力。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十六日讯：巴黎报纸广泛评论苏联在十月二十三日给西方国家的照会。
    法国资产阶级报纸担心苏联建议对舆论的影响，于是拼命叫嚷说苏联的照会中“没有任何新的东西”。
    个别资产阶级报纸，如“费加罗报”根据这点得出结论说：“由于没有新的东西，和苏联举行谈判就不可能有良好的开端”。社会党报纸“巴黎人民报”则硬说和苏联进行关于保障欧洲安全的谈判和西德的军国主义化并不矛盾。
    其他一些报纸却抱着另外一种看法，“战斗报”写道：“应当恢复和东方的谈判，因为两个直接对立的集团的和平共处的前途如何，取决于这种谈判的结局，也就是说，或者取得和平，或者不得不安于武装的和平，而后者的结果是不容十分乐观的。对于恢复这种谈判应该表现主动的正是法国，因为法国对维护和平——和平共处的条件——比别的国家有着更大的利害关系。”
    “解放报”谴责孟戴斯—弗朗斯所执行的武装波恩复仇主义者的计划。这家报纸把苏联照会中提出的关于和平解决德国问题、组织欧洲集体安全体系的建议和孟戴斯—弗朗斯的这个政策作了对比。报纸写道：苏联在提出这些建议同时，还提出了三点警告：一、伦敦协定一旦付之实行，重新统一德国的希望就会长期消失。二、这些协定是直接违背法苏条约的。三、不可能一方面在联合国进行关于裁军的认真谈判，另一方面却实行武装西德……这家报纸强调说：问题是很清楚的：“要末就是进行谈判，以求得问题的广泛解决，从而使武装德国成为不必要，要末就是同意武装西德，而扼杀刚刚萌芽的谈判的机会。”
    “人道报”刊载了苏联致西方三国照会全文。“人道报”要求法国人民尽一切力量来使国民议会的议员们拒绝巴黎协定，支持苏联政府提出的、由有关国家谈判解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国资产阶级报纸都刊载了苏联十月二十三日的照会的消息，有些报纸并且发表了评论。
    工党的“每日先驱报”说：和批准巴黎协定的准备工作同时，应该同苏联举行谈判。
    其他资产阶级报纸则一方面要求认真对待苏联照会，指出不要冒失拒绝把照会作为进一步协商的基础；但是另一方面，却提出了一种论调——首先批准巴黎协定，然后才能和苏联举行谈判。这些资产阶级报纸打着以“实力”进行谈判的算盘。“泰晤士报”就企图为这种主张进行辩解。它承认苏联照会“向一切认真而热心的和平追求者再度提出了德国问题中的非此即彼的危险”，并认为“只要德国仍然分裂一天，欧洲问题就不能认为最后解决了。”然而，同时它却作出了一个完全没有根据的结论，说什么，“俄国的解决办法中的危险大得多”。“约克郡邮报”写道：“今天我们能够以实力来进行谈判。”但是，这家报纸也明白：这样的政策不一定能得逞。它因此又说：“决不能肯定，事变今后的发展将对我们有利。”
    还有一些报纸主张在开始谈判以前，应当要苏联履行某些“先决”条件。例如，“西方邮报与南威尔士新闻”援引巴黎外交界人士的话说，“西方认为，要召开会议，就必须签订结束奥地利占领状态的条约，举行全德自由选举。”但是要知道苏联政府在照会中正是建议讨论这些问题。
    资产阶级报纸喋喋不休地重弹老调说，苏联照会的目的是为批准巴黎协定制造障碍。
    这些报纸所以这样说，显然是因为拿不出充足的理由来反对苏联的建议。而各国人民正在等待西方国家对目的在保障欧洲和平与安全的苏联建议的实质作出答复。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：美国报界广泛评论了苏联政府十月二十三日的照会。
    美国的宣传工具表达了美国统治者的观点，认为苏联的建议是对美国侵略计划的威胁，因此竭力主张拒绝苏联政府的照会。
    美联社华盛顿记者报道说，美国国务院还没有评论苏联的照会，然而据推测，美、英、法三国将拒绝苏联要求在十一月召开四国外长会议的建议。
    但是，美国报界知道，明白拒绝苏联倡议将引起全世界公众的不满，所以它们辩解说，一般说来西方国家并不拒绝和苏联谈判。
    美联社驻华盛顿记者海托华写道：“外交官员们说，西方国家武装西德的计划将提供一个和俄国谈判解决欧洲问题的新的实力基础。因此，人们认为，在新计划得到批准之后，是可能再举行一次四大国外长会议来讨论德国统一问题、对奥条约问题以及各有关问题的。据悉，包括国务卿杜勒斯在内的西方领袖们已一致同意，在获得批准之前，他们不要与俄国举行会议。”
    美国报纸还表示，它们担心苏联照会可能妨碍执行西德重新武装计划。“纽约时报”就说，苏联关于在德国举行自由选举的建议可能对重新武装西德的计划发生严重影响。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”驻巴黎记者库克力主西方国家应该蛮干下去，“不要因为苏联的照会或其他分散注意的东西而中断或更改”它们武装西德的计划。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在社论中把苏联的照会同法国和西德国内对巴黎协定的反对联系起来了。这家报纸说，“法国议员们坚决主张在德国重新武装实现之前先和俄国举行新的会谈；德国社会民主党则指责阿登纳总理为了取得和西方的联盟而牺牲德国的统一。”
