Many Economically Valuable Seaweeds Discovered Along the Coast of Fujian Province

Fujian Province has a coastline of over 2,000 kilometers, with numerous islands and reefs along the coast, making it a major area for the growth and reproduction of marine algae. In March of this year, the Marine Plant Survey Team of the Institute of Marine Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences arrived in Fujian and cooperated with the Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau to carry out marine plant collection and investigation work. After more than three months of field investigation, it was initially discovered that there are more than 100 species of algae, of which more than 30 species are of economic value. Some of these algae are important raw materials for industry or medicine, and some are edible. For example, *Hailuo* can be made into *Hailuo* gum, which can be used in the textile industry for dyeing fabrics, making the fibers strong, shiny, and beautiful. Gracilaria, Gelidium and *Centipede Algae* can be made into agar (commonly known as jelly), which is not only a delicacy for eating, but also can be used as a laxative in medicine or as a binder and coating in industry, and as a lubricant for making electric light filaments.  *Sargassum*, for instance, can be used to extract iodine and potassium chloride, and can also be made into alginate to treat corneal diseases in ophthalmology. Seaweed, *Enteromorpha*, and Ulva are even more so foods for the general public. The particularly economically valuable *Eelgrass* is a new discovery in the province's seaweed resources. So far, this species has not been found in other regions. It is rich in iodine and has good nutritional value. According to scientific analysis, its quality is comparable to kelp.

In order to further develop resources and increase breeding areas, last year the Chinese Academy of Sciences specially sent personnel to transport *Eelgrass* from Pingtan to Qingdao using scientific refrigeration methods for transplantation. The result was good growth, and now scientific research departments are conducting experiments on crossbreeding *Eelgrass* spores with kelp.

Fujian Province's seaweed resources are not only diverse but also abundant in yield. For example, seaweed can produce 5,000 *dan* annually, and the industrial raw materials, red algae, Gracilaria, and Gelidium can each produce hundreds of *dan* annually. Currently, these algae are purchased by state-owned aquatic product enterprises from fishing areas, processed, and transported to Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places to supply the needs of urban residents.

    福建省沿海发现很多有经济价值的海藻
    福建省海岸线长达二千余公里，沿海岛屿、岩礁起伏，是海洋藻类生长繁殖主要地区。今年三月，中国科学院海洋生物研究室海洋植物调查组到达福建，与省水产局配合进行海产植物采查工作。经过三个多月的实地调查，初步发现藻类达百余种，其中富有经济价值的藻类共有三十种以上。这些藻类有的是工业或医药主要原料，有的可供食用。例如海萝，可制成海萝胶，供纺织工业染布匹，能使纤维坚韧光泽增加美观。石花菜、江篱及蜈蚣藻可制成琼胶（俗称冻粉），不但是食用的珍品，同时可作医疗上的泻药或工业上糊料和涂料及制电灯丝的润滑剂等。又如马尾藻可提炼碘及氯化钾、也可制成褐藻胶用来治疗眼科角膜。又如紫菜、牛毛苔、石莼、更为广大人民的食品。有特别经济价值的鹅掌菜，是该省海藻资源中的一种新发现，迄目前为止，其他地区尚未有此种发现，它含有丰富的碘质，营养价值很好，据科学分析，其品质可与海带相媲美。
    为了进一步开发资源增加繁殖地区，去年中国科学院还特地派专人将平潭的鹅掌菜，利用科学上冰箱保藏方法，运送青岛移植，结果生长良好，现在科学研究部门正进行试验鹅掌菜与海带胞子配种工作。
    福建省海藻资源，不但种类多而且产量丰富，例如紫菜每年可出产五千担，工业原料赤菜、石花菜、江篱每年各可产数百担，现在这些藻类均由国营水产企业向渔区收购，进行加工，运往上海、北京、天津、广州等地，供给城市人民的需要。
