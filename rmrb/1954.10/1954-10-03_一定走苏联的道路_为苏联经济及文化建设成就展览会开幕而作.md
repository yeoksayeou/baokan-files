We Must Follow the Soviet Path
—On the Occasion of the Opening of the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction
Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade

Just as the First Session of the First National People’s Congress of our country victoriously adopted the first people's democratic constitution in our history, just as the people of the whole country joyfully celebrated the election of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong as the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and celebrated the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with unparalleled excitement, the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction opened in Beijing. Its opening added luster to our grand festival and once again pointed out the magnificent prospects for our socialist economic construction. It is a most solemn and precious congratulatory gift from the government and people of the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to us, it is a symbol of our future. The Chinese people are welcoming the opening of such a large-scale and rich exhibition with great enthusiasm. From this exhibition, we can see the great achievements of Soviet socialist construction and receive the deep friendship of the Soviet government and people towards us. We can learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society and personally receive a profound and vivid education on the socialist future, thereby more clearly recognizing our goals of hard work and the path we follow in carrying out socialist construction, further encouraging our enthusiasm and confidence in building a socialist society.

This exhibition is the largest comprehensive exhibition held by the Soviet Union abroad, demonstrating the brilliant achievements of the great socialist Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction over the past thirty-seven years since its founding. The more than 11,500 exhibits include the latest and largest products of the most basic machine-building industry, metallurgical industry, fuel industry, and electrical industry in Soviet socialist industrial construction; exquisite products of various textile industries, chemical industries, and other various daily necessities industries and handicrafts; various rich grains, cash crops, animal products, fruits, vegetables, and their products from Soviet mechanized agricultural collective production. In addition, various books, journals, teaching materials, oil paintings, sculptures, musical scores, pictures, etc., demonstrating the popularization of education, the development of science, and the high level of culture and art in the Soviet Union are also exhibited. Such a rich and comprehensive exhibition provides the Chinese people with a concrete image of a real socialist society, allowing the Chinese people to understand all aspects of the economic and cultural life of the Soviet people who are moving towards a communist society, thereby realizing the superiority of the socialist system and increasing our confidence a hundredfold in building our country into an independent, prosperous, strong, and happy socialist society. This exhibition is also the most complete "school" for us to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism. Whether workers, peasants, students, professors, artists, engineers, architects, or office cadres, they can learn their favorite professional knowledge in this exhibition hall. Since we are still in the initial stage of socialist economic construction and lack various experiences and knowledge, we should feel particularly precious for such a comprehensive and specialized "school" prepared for us by the Soviet Union. We should take this opportunity to visit carefully and study hard, so as not to fail the deep concern and friendship of the Soviet government and people towards us. From the process of building this exhibition hall, it is also a very practical learning experience for us in Soviet socialist architectural art and construction technology. Whether in modeling design, technical design, or construction process, excellent Soviet architects and engineers selflessly and patiently guided our technicians and construction workers, enabling us to learn new scientific technologies and advanced experience, overcome various difficulties, and improve work efficiency, thus completing the construction task of this newest and largest Soviet exhibition hall in the country in a short period of one year. In the exhibition hall, there are also magnificent theaters, cinemas, and large restaurants. The Soviet government also sent excellent folk art song and dance troupes and first-class chefs, so that we can not only appreciate the outstanding Soviet art performances and experience the famous dishes of various regions and ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, but more importantly, we can learn about the socialist way of life of the Soviet people from here, thereby further enhancing the friendship between the two peoples.

Such a grand exhibition, encompassing all aspects from heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, culture, education, art, architecture, as well as film, song and dance, and cooking, fully demonstrates the superiority of the Soviet socialist system everywhere. This exhibition itself also marks the further consolidation and development of friendly cooperation between the governments and peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and further marks the closer and more solid unity of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union in the cause of peaceful construction.

Undoubtedly, the results of the exhibition of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition will further enhance the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese people and the great Soviet people, strengthen the close unity between the two peoples in peaceful construction and in defending the Far East and world peace, and will exert even greater power.

The Soviet Union is our most loyal and reliable friend, not only because the victory of the October Revolution helped the Chinese people find the bright and happy socialist road, but also because the Soviet Union has consistently sympathized with and assisted the Chinese people's liberation struggle. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government was the first to recognize our country and has consistently supported our country diplomatically. In February 1950, China and the Soviet Union concluded the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, which has great historical significance; for five years, the Soviet Union has provided our country with long-term low-interest loans and various economic and technical assistance. Many Soviet experts came to our country at the invitation of our government to help our country carry out economic recovery and construction work. They sincerely and unreservedly passed on the advanced socialist experience and technology to us. After the United States imperialism imposed an "embargo" on our country, the Soviet Union actively expanded equal and mutually beneficial trade with our country, enabling our country to fully obtain the various materials necessary for economic recovery and development. In 1953, when our country began its first five-year plan, the Soviet government undertook to provide economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of 141 large-scale enterprises, including iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mines, oil refineries, machine-building plants, automobile manufacturing plants, and tractor manufacturing plants, from site selection, design, equipment supply, installation guidance, to the manufacture of new products, from beginning to end, within seven years. The Soviet people regarded this assistance as their sacred task. In the equipment they supplied to our country, they provided the latest technology and helped our country train technical personnel to ensure a good foundation for our country's industrialization. This assistance is decisive for our country to realize socialist construction and socialist transformation. The Chinese people will never forget the great, comprehensive, long-term, generous, selfless, and fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union to our country.

The economic construction of the first five-year plan of the People's Republic of China has made great progress. The constitution recently formulated by our National People's Congress has clearly pointed out that our country is moving forward on the bright road of socialism. Everyone knows that the law of historical development in China is bound to take the road of socialism, and the great Soviet Union is our example. We must follow the Soviet path. The Soviet Union today is our tomorrow. The Chinese people yearn for socialist Soviet Union. The exhibition of the achievements of Soviet economic and cultural construction allows us to specifically understand the reality of the Soviet economy and culture after thirty-seven years of long-term construction. We can see the happy and joyful life of the Soviet people from here, and we can also see the incomparably powerful strength of the Soviet Union. Building socialism in our country is naturally an arduous and complex task, but we are encouraged by the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union's thirty-seven years of economic and cultural construction, which will enable us to increase our confidence and courage a hundredfold and build our motherland into a socialist country like the Soviet Union.

    一定走苏联的道路
    ——为苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕而作
    对外贸易部部长　叶季壮
    正当我国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议胜利地通过了我国历史上第一个人民民主的宪法的时候，正当全国人民欢欣鼓舞地庆祝着伟大的领袖毛泽东同志当选为中华人民共和国的主席，并以无比的兴奋欢度中华人民共和国成立五周年的节日的时候，苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会在北京开幕了。它的开幕，为我国盛大的节日增加了光采，为我国正在进行着的社会主义经济建设，再一次指出了壮丽的远景。它是伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府和人民给我们的一份最隆重、最珍贵的贺仪，它是我们未来的象征，中国人民正以万分热烈的心情来欢迎这样一个规模宏大的内容丰富的展览会的开幕。从这个展览会中我们可以看到苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就并领受到苏联政府和人民对我们的深厚的友谊，我们可以学习苏联建设社会主义社会的先进经验，并亲身受一次深刻的形象化的社会主义前途教育，从而更明确地认识到我们努力奋斗的目标和进行社会主义建设所遵循的道路，更加鼓舞着我们建设社会主义社会的热情和信心。
    这次展览会是苏联在国外举行规模最大的一次综合性展览会，它显示了伟大的社会主义苏联建国三十七年来经济和文化建设上的辉煌成就。全部展品一万一千五百多件，包括了苏联在社会主义工业建设中最基本的机器制造工业、冶金工业、燃料工业和电器工业的各种最新型和最大型的产品；各种纺织工业、化学工业和其他各种日用品工业、手工业的精美产品；苏联机械化农业集体生产的各种丰富的谷物、经济作物、畜产品、水果蔬菜及其制品等。此外，还展出了表明苏联教育普及、科学发达、高度文化艺术水平的各种书刊、教材、油画、雕塑、乐谱、图片等。这样丰富全面的展览，给中国人民提供了一个现实的社会主义社会的具体形象，使中国人民了解正在向着共产主义社会迈进的苏联人民经济和文化生活的各个方面，从而体会到社会主义制度的优越性，百倍增强我们将我国建成为独立、富强、繁荣、幸福的社会主义社会的信心。这个展览会又是我们学习苏联建设社会主义的先进经验的一座最完备的“学校”。无论工人、农民、学生、教授、艺术家、工程师、建筑师和机关干部，都可以在这展览馆内学到他喜爱的专业知识，当我们还处在社会主义经济建设的初期，各种经验知识还很不足，对于苏联为我们准备的这样一座又全面又专门的“学校”，应当感到格外珍贵，我们应该利用这个机会仔细参观，好好学习，才不辜负苏联政府和人民对我们的深切关怀和友谊。就筹建这座展览馆的过程来说，也是我们对苏联社会主义建筑艺术和施工技术的一次非常切实的学习，无论在造型设计、技术设计和施工过程中，苏联优秀的建筑师、工程师，无私地耐心地指导我们的技术人员和建筑工人，使我们学会了新的科学技术与先进经验，克服了各种困难，提高了工作效率，因而在短短的一年内完成这座在全国最新型的巨大的苏联展览馆的建筑任务。在展览馆中还有富丽堂皇的剧场、电影院和大餐厅，苏联政府还派来优秀的民间艺术歌舞团，和第一流的厨师，使我们不仅能欣赏苏联卓越的艺术表演和领略苏联各个地区、各个民族的名菜，更重要的是从这里可以了解到苏联人民的社会主义生活方式，从而更进一步增强两国人民的友谊。
    像这样从重工业、轻工业、农业、文化、教育、艺术、建筑以及电影、歌舞、烹调等包罗各个方面，内容丰富精湛，规模宏伟巨大的展览会，处处都充分表现出苏联社会主义制度的优越性。这次展出本身也就是标志着中苏两国政府和人民间友好合作的进一步巩固和发展，更标志着中苏两国人民在和平建设事业中更亲密地巩固地团结在一起。
    无疑的，这次苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会展出的结果，将更增进中国人民和伟大的苏联人民兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊，加强两国人民在和平建设与保卫远东和世界和平中的亲密团结，并将发挥出更强大的力量。
    苏联是我们最忠实最可靠的朋友，不仅是由于十月革命的胜利，帮助中国人民找到了光明幸福的社会主义道路，并且苏联始终如一地同情中国人民的解放斗争并给以援助。在中华人民共和国成立以后，苏联政府首先承认了我国，并且一贯地在外交上支持我国。一九五○年二月，中苏两国缔结了具有伟大历史意义的友好同盟互助条约；五年以来，苏联给予我国长期低利的贷款，给我国以各种经济和技术的援助。许多苏联专家应我国政府邀请来到我国，帮助我国进行经济恢复工作和建设工作，他们诚心诚意地、毫无保留地把社会主义的先进经验和技术传授给我们。美帝国主义对我国实施“禁运”以后，苏联积极的扩大了对我国的平等互利的贸易，使我国能够充分获得恢复和发展经济所必需的各种物资。一九五三年，当我国开始第一个五年计划的时候，苏联政府承担在七年内，对我国新建和改建包括钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿、炼油厂、机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、电力站等一四一项规模宏大的企业，从选择厂址、进行设计、供应设备、指导安装直到制造新产品，从头到尾的给予经济和技术的援助。苏联人民把这种援助当作是他们神圣的任务，他们在供应我国的设备中，提供了最新的技术，帮助我国培养技术人员，以保证我国工业化事业的良好基础。这种援助对于我国实现社会主义建设和社会主义改造是有决定性作用的。苏联对我国这种伟大的、全面的、长期的、慷慨无私的、兄弟般的援助是我国人民永远不会忘记的。
    中华人民共和国的第一个五年计划经济建设已获得巨大的进步，我们全国人民代表大会最近制定的宪法已明确地指出了我国正在社会主义的光明大道上迈进。大家都知道，中国历史发展的规律，必然要走社会主义的道路，伟大的苏联就是我们的榜样，我们一定走苏联的道路。苏联的今天，就是我们的明天，中国人民向往着社会主义的苏联。苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的展出，使我们可以从这里具体地了解经过了三十七年长期建设的苏联经济和文化各方面的现实面貌。我们可以从这里看到苏联人民的幸福愉快的生活，更可以看出苏联无比强大的力量。我国建设社会主义事业，自然是一个艰苦而复杂的任务，但我们从苏联三十七年经济和文化建设的辉煌成就中得到鼓舞，将使我们百倍地提高信心和勇气，把我们的祖国建设成为一个像苏联一样的社会主义国家。
