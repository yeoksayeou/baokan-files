    "The Constitution of the People's Republic of China" Single-Volume Edition
    Has Been Published 12.5 Million Copies Across the Country
    Xinhua bookstores across the country have distributed 12.5 million copies of the single-volume edition of "The Constitution of the People's Republic of China."
    After the publication of the single-volume edition of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, in order to promptly meet the needs of readers, Xinhua bookstores' branches in cities generally sent special personnel to actively deliver books to factories, government offices, and military units. Xinhua bookstores in rural areas generally strengthened their mobile supply work to deliver the single-volume edition of the Constitution to the hands of the peasant masses. The Shanghai branch of Xinhua Bookstore distributed more than 420,000 copies of the single-volume edition of the Constitution within ten days. The widespread distribution of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been welcomed by people of all ethnic groups. When the Lama Xirao Pengcuo from Kangding County went to the Kangding branch of Xinhua Bookstore to buy the Tibetan version of the single-volume edition of the Constitution, he said: In the past, during the reactionary rule, ethnic minorities suffered discrimination and oppression, and we were not even allowed to read Tibetan. Only today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, do we have true ethnic equality and our own Constitution. (Xinhua News Agency)
