    China's Foreign Trade in the Past Five Years
    Li Zheren
    The Common Program adopted by the First National People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulated the basic principles of China's foreign trade: "To restore and develop commercial trade relations with the governments and peoples of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit," and "To implement controls on foreign trade and adopt protectionist trade policies." Over the past five years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and with the specific leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, the strong support of relevant departments, and the nationwide support of the people, we have basically implemented this correct policy, and thus have achieved considerable success in foreign trade.
    In the past five years, on the basis of the complete victory of the New Democratic Revolution, China has firmly established independent and autonomous foreign trade, completely shaking off the dependence of old China's foreign trade on imperialism, and making China's foreign trade a tool for serving the people. With the rapid recovery and development of China's economy, China's import and export volume has greatly increased. The total import and export volume in 1953 increased by 81% compared with 1950. Judging from the current implementation of import and export plans, 1954 will also have further growth compared with 1953. The recovery and development of China's foreign trade has played a considerably important role in promoting the recovery and development of the domestic economy, especially the recovery and development of industrial production. In 1953, means of production accounted for about 87% of imported commodities (mainly including various machines, complete sets of equipment, and industrial raw materials), and daily necessities (sugar, cloth, paper, etc.) accounted for about 13%. The import of these daily necessities has helped to meet the needs of the Chinese people's lives and maintain the stability of the domestic market. This is fundamentally opposite to the large-scale import of luxury goods and non-essential goods from imperialist countries during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, such as cigarettes, alcohol, lipstick, nylon stockings, toilet paper, etc.
    Trade with the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries occupies a very important position in China's foreign trade. Over the past five years, on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual assistance, and cooperation, and based on the spirit of combining internationalism and patriotism, we have planned and actively expanded trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries year by year. China's import and export volume with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in 1953 was about four times that of 1950. China has imported a large number of various machines, equipment, and industrial raw materials from the Soviet Union at low prices and top quality, which has greatly helped the construction and new construction of many factories, mines, and other enterprises in China. China has also imported a lot of machinery, equipment and other important materials from various People's Democratic countries, which has also been of great help to China's industrial construction. At the same time, various agricultural products, by-products, livestock products, mineral products, and handicrafts exported by China to the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries not only guarantee that these products of our country can obtain broad and reliable sales channels, thereby promoting the development of production, but also help to improve the lives of the people of fraternal countries and the economic upsurge. This mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries not only mutually promotes economic development, but also embodies the close unity and deep friendship between them, and contributes to consolidating world lasting peace. There is no doubt that with the development of China's planned economic construction, China's trade with the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries will continue to grow in a planned and proportional manner, which will be of greater help to China's gradual realization of socialist industrialization.
    While developing trade with the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries, we have always advocated actively developing commercial trade relations with capitalist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, because this is very important for improving the economic and living conditions of the people of all countries, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship, and maintaining world lasting peace. In 1950, China's import and export volume with Western countries had considerable development. However, later, because the US aggressive bloc coerced other Western countries to implement a policy of "blockade" and "embargo" against China together with it, and instructed the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, which had stolen Taiwan, to constantly attack and plunder foreign ships engaged in trade with China, the trade volume in this area has been artificially obstructed and declined for a time. However, because China has consistently and actively implemented the correct policy of developing commercial trade relations with any foreign country under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, industrialists and businessmen in many Western and Asian countries are willing to trade with China. Therefore, since the Moscow International Economic Conference in the summer of 1952, China's trade with the capitalist world market has begun to recover and develop. The trade volume in this area in 1953 increased by 52% compared with 1952. Now, China has trade relations with many countries in the capitalist world market. Among them, countries that have signed trade agreements or contracts between the two governments include India, Ceylon, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Finland. Countries that have signed trade agreements between the two business groups include the United Kingdom, France, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Chile, Japan, etc. There are also many countries' industrialists and businessmen who have regular trade relations with China's foreign trade enterprises. Facts have proved that the implementation of the so-called "blockade" and "embargo" policy cannot hinder the growth of China's economy and foreign trade, but only facilitates the US monopoly capital group to manipulate and encroach on the capitalist world market, causing those countries that implement this policy of the US aggressive bloc to lose market, rights, and interests and suffer considerable encroachments. Therefore, the greatest victim of the "blockade" and "embargo" is not China, but those countries that implement this policy of the US aggressive bloc. There is no doubt that China will continue to widely develop trade relations with the capitalist world market on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, in order to adapt to each other's economic needs, further ease international tensions, and maintain world peace.
    China's trade with many countries is basically conducted in the form of barter trade. This method of exchanging goods allows both parties to expand trade according to their own needs and facilitates mutual payment. This not only conforms to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, but also avoids the difficulties of dollar shortages that exist in many countries. If direct barter encounters certain difficulties, indirect barter can also be used. Therefore, we believe that barter is a good way to develop normal international trade.
    State-owned foreign trade is a socialist economic component owned by the whole people and is the leading force in China's foreign trade economy. Therefore, over the past five years, we have gradually increased the proportion of state-owned foreign trade in foreign trade and implemented policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation of private import and export merchants. To date, state-owned foreign trade has occupied an absolute advantage in China's foreign trade. We are adopting state capitalist forms such as joint ventures, distribution, agency imports, and agency exports, so that private import and export merchants can have business to do and obtain reasonable profits under the control of foreign trade and the leadership of the state-owned foreign trade economy, so as to give play to their due enthusiasm for trade with capitalist countries and gradually realize socialist transformation.
    In the past five years, the operation and management of state-owned foreign trade enterprises have also gradually improved, thereby accelerating commodity circulation, saving expenses, reducing costs, and completing the state's annual profit delivery tasks. In this way, it has played a certain role in accumulating funds for national industrial construction.
    Although foreign trade work has achieved the above achievements, there have also been and still exist many shortcomings. The most basic of these shortcomings is that our systematic investigation and research on the supply and demand situation in various countries around the world, on changes in world market conditions, on the supply and demand situation of China's export materials, and on the needs of China's imports is still insufficient. Therefore, the planning is not enough, the coordination between domestic sales and foreign sales plans is not good enough, and the potential of export commodities has not been fully utilized. The operation and management still need to be improved, various expenses and costs are still high, and accidents and losses occur from time to time. The specifications and standards for the purchase of some export agricultural and sideline products are set too high, and the procedures are not simple enough. In order to do our foreign trade work better, under the correct leadership of the central government, we have full confidence in consolidating our existing achievements and quickly overcoming these shortcomings step by step. At the same time, we hope that others can point out the shortcomings and errors in our work at any time and in any place in order to improve.
    In the future, the central task of China's foreign trade is to better serve China's socialist industrialization. We must concentrate our efforts to continue to ensure the import of machinery, equipment, raw materials, and other important materials necessary for China's heavy industry construction, and appropriately import some materials necessary for the development of light industry, transportation industry, and agricultural production, as well as those urgently needed to supply the people's daily lives. To this end, we must plan to expand the export of various agricultural and sideline products from China. This requires us to continue to vigorously organize export sources, give play to the potential of existing export commodities, explore new export commodities, and ensure the completion of the state's export plan. In order to achieve this goal, we must strengthen the procurement of export commodities, plan and actively support the increase in production and improvement of the quality of export commodities. At the same time, we must practice strict economy, oppose waste, squeeze out export materials separately, and appropriately increase the sale of goods to exchange for imported materials necessary for economic construction. This is done in order to realize socialist industrialization, for the long-term interests of the country and the people, and to obtain a material basis for permanently improving life. At the same time, our squeezing out of export materials is not carried out on the basis of lowering the people's living standards, but is planned to appropriately take into account the continuous improvement of the people's lives. Therefore, this policy has gained the strong support of the people across the country in the past, enabling us to complete the state's export plan. We firmly believe that we will certainly receive greater support from the people across the country in the future. China's foreign trade will inevitably gradually grow with large-scale planned economic construction and should better complete the glorious tasks it should undertake in the national economy.

    五年来我国的对外贸易
    李哲人
    第一次全国人民政治协商会议所通过的共同纲领，明确地规定了我国对外贸易的基本方针是：“在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系”，“实行对外贸易的管制，并采用保护贸易政策。”五年来，在以毛主席为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，并在各地党政的具体领导、各有关部门和全国人民的大力支持下，我们基本上贯彻了这个正确方针，因而在对外贸易上获得了不小成就。
    五年来，在新民主主义革命完全胜利的基础上，我国已巩固地树立了独立自主的对外贸易，彻底地摆脱了旧中国对外贸易对帝国主义的依附，使我国的对外贸易成为为人民服务的工具。随着我国经济迅速恢复和发展，我国的进出口额有了很大的增加。一九五三年的进出口额比一九五○年增加了百分之八十一；从目前进出口计划执行情况来看，一九五四年比一九五三年亦将有进一步的增长。我国对外贸易的恢复和发展，对促进国内经济的恢复和发展，特别是工业生产的恢复和发展，起了相当重要的作用。一九五三年进口商品中生产资料约占百分之八十七（其中主要是各种机器、成套设备和工业原料、材料），日用品（糖、布、纸等）约占百分之十三。这些日用品的输入，对供应我国人民生活的需要，维持国内市场的稳定，都有所帮助。这与国民党反动派统治时期从帝国主义国家大量输入奢侈品和非必需品，例如纸烟、酒类、口红、玻璃丝袜、手纸等，在本质上是完全相反的。
    对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易，在我国对外贸易中占有极重要的地位。五年来，在平等互利、互助合作和双方需要与可能的基础上，并根据国际主义和爱国主义相结合的精神，我们有计划地积极地逐年扩大了对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易。我国对苏联和各人民民主国家的进出口额，一九五三年约等于一九五○年的四倍。我国从苏联输入了大批的价格低廉、品质头等的各种机器、设备和工业原料、材料，使我国许多工厂、矿山和其他企业的修建和新建，得到了极大的帮助。我国也从各人民民主国家输入了不少机器设备和其他重要物资，对我国工业建设也有不小的帮助。同时，我国向苏联和各人民民主国家所输出的各种农产品、副产品、畜产品、矿产品、手工艺品，不但保证着我国这些产品能够得到广阔可靠的销路，从而促进生产的发展，而且有助于兄弟国家人民生活的提高和经济的高涨。我国与苏联和各人民民主国家这种互助合作，不但相互地促进了经济的发展，而且体现了彼此间的亲密团结和深厚友谊，并对巩固世界持久和平有所贡献。毫无疑问，随着我国有计划的经济建设的发展，我国对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易将继续有计划地按比例地逐步增长，对我国逐步实现社会主义工业化将有更大的帮助。
    在发展对苏联和各人民民主国家贸易的同时，我们历来主张在平等互利的基础上积极发展同资本主义国家的通商贸易关系，因为这对于改善各国人民的经济和生活状况，增进彼此的了解和友谊，和维护世界持久和平，都是很重要的。一九五○年，我国对西方国家的进出口额，曾有过相当大的发展。但是，后来因为美国侵略集团胁迫其他西方国家和它一道对我国实行“封锁”“禁运”的政策，并指使窃踞台湾的蒋介石卖国集团不断地袭击和打劫来我国通商的外国船舶，使得这方面的贸易额曾受到了人为的障碍而一度下降。然而，由于我国一贯积极地执行在平等互利原则下与任何外国发展通商贸易关系的正确政策，西方和亚洲许多国家的工商业家都愿意与我国进行贸易往来，因此，从一九五二年夏季莫斯科国际经济会议以来，我国对资本主义世界市场的贸易又开始恢复和发展，这方面的贸易额一九五三年比一九五二年增加了百分之五十二。现在，我国和资本主义世界市场中不少国家有着贸易来往，其中双方政府间签订了贸易协定或合同者有印度、锡兰、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦、芬兰等国；双方工商团体间签订了贸易协议者有英国、法国、意大利、西德、比利时、荷兰、瑞士、智利、日本等国；还有不少国家的工商业者和我国对外贸易企业有着经常的贸易往来。事实证明，实行所谓“封锁”“禁运”政策的结果，并不能阻挠我国经济及对外贸易的增长，只不过便于美国垄断资本集团操纵和侵夺资本主义世界市场，使那些执行美国侵略集团这一政策的国家丧失了市场，权利和利益上受到不少侵夺。因此，受到“封锁”、“禁运”损害最大的并不是我国，而是那些执行美国侵略集团这一政策的国家。毫无疑问，我国将在平等互利的原则下继续广泛地发展对资本主义世界市场的贸易关系，以期适应彼此经济需要，进一步缓和国际紧张局势，维护世界和平。
    我国与许多国家的贸易，基本上是采取易货方式的。这种互通有无的办法使双方都能根据自己的需要来扩大贸易并便于相互支付。这不仅符合平等互利的原则，而且可以免除许多国家所存在着的美元短缺的困难。如果直接易货遇着某些困难时，也可以采用间接易货。所以我们认为易货的办法是开展国际间正常贸易的好办法。
    国营对外贸易是全民所有制的社会主义经济成份，是我国对外贸易经济中的领导力量。因此，五年来，我们逐渐增长着对外贸易中的国营对外贸易比重，并对私营进出口商实行了利用、限制、改造的政策。迄今国营对外贸易在我国对外贸易中已占绝对优势。我们正在采取联营、经销、代进、代出等国家资本主义形式，使私营进出口商在对外贸易管制和国营对外贸易经济领导下有业务可做，有合理利润可得，以发挥他们对资本主义国家贸易应有的积极性，并逐步实现社会主义改造。
    五年来，国营对外贸易企业的经营管理也逐步有所改善，从而加速商品流转，节约开支，降低成本，完成了国家每年赋予的上缴利润任务。这样，就在为国家工业建设积累资金上起了一定作用。
    对外贸易工作虽然取得了以上成绩，但也发生过和仍然存在着不少缺点。其中最基本的缺点是我们对世界各国的供求情况、对世界市场行情的变化、对我国出口物资的供求情况和我国进口的需要情况，系统的调查研究还不够，了解得还不够或不及时。因此经营的计划性也就不够，内销和外销计划衔接得也就不够好，出口商品的潜力还发挥得不够；经营管理尚改进不够，各种开支和费用还大，事故损失不时发生；有些出口农副产品的收购上规格标准定得偏高，手续不够简便。为了把我们的对外贸易工作作得更好，在中央正确领导下我们有充分的信心巩固已有成绩，并有步骤地迅速克服这些缺点。同时，我们希望别人能随时随地指出我们工作中的缺点和错误，以便改进。
    今后我国对外贸易的中心任务是要更好地为我国社会主义工业化服务。我们一定要集中力量继续保证输入我国重工业建设所必需的机器、设备、原料、材料和其他重要物资，并适当地输入一些发展轻工业、交通运输业和农业生产所必需的及供应人民日常生活迫切需要的物资。为此，我们就要有计划地扩大我国各种农副产品的出口。这就必须继续大力组织出口货源，发挥现有出口商品的潜力，发掘新的出口商品，保证完成国家的出口计划。为了达到这一目的，我们必须加强出口商品的收购工作，有计划地积极扶助出口商品增加生产和提高质量。同时，我们必须厉行节约，反对浪费，有分别地挤出出口物资，适当增加易销商品，来换取经济建设所必需进口的物资。这样作，是为了实现社会主义工业化，为了国家和人民的长远利益，为了获得永久改善生活的物质基础。同时，我们挤出出口物资并不是在降低人民生活水平的基础上来进行的，而是有计划地适当照顾到人民生活的不断改善的。因此，这一政策过去获得了全国人民的大力支持，使我们能完成国家的出口计划。我们坚信，今后也一定将会获得全国人民更大的支持。我国的对外贸易必然会随着大规模的有计划的经济建设而逐步增长，并应更好地完成它在国民经济中应当担负的光荣任务。
