Zhejiang Huangyan Mandarin Oranges Achieve a Bumper Harvest

The Huangyan mandarin oranges, which are sold well both domestically and abroad, have ripened. Along the banks of the Chengjiang River, where mandarin oranges are abundant, groups of orange-picking teams are active everywhere. The procurement work at the production areas officially started on October 25th, and it is estimated that the first batch of mandarin oranges will be shipped out in early November. Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Huangyan orange farmers have vigorously promoted advanced technologies such as rational fertilization, pruning, and pest and disease control this year. As a result, mandarin oranges have achieved another bumper harvest. The total output can reach 54.84 million catties, an increase of 41 percent compared to last year. According to preliminary estimates, the average qualified rate for export sales can reach about 40 percent, an increase of 4 percent compared to last year. In order to ensure the completion of the state procurement plan and lay the foundation for a bumper orange harvest next year, Huangyan County convened a county-wide orange farmer representative meeting in late September to mobilize orange farmers to pick and fertilize at the same time and do a good job in orchard cleaning and pruning. At the meeting, orange farmer representatives stated that they would sell all the oranges to the state to support national industrial construction. (Our Zhejiang Reporter Station)

    浙江省黄岩蜜橘丰收
    畅销国内外的黄岩蜜橘已经成熟，盛产蜜橘的澄江两岸现在到处活跃着成群结伴的采橘小组。产地收购工作已于十月二十五日正式开始，预计第一批蜜橘在十一月初即可外运。在共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下，今年黄岩橘农大力推广了合理施肥、修枝和防治病虫害等先进技术，因此蜜橘又获得了丰收，总产量可达五千四百八十四万斤，比去年增产百分之四十一；外销合格率据初步估计平均可达百分之四十左右，比去年提高百分之四。为了保证国家收购计划的完成和替明年橘果丰收打下基础，黄岩县在九月下旬曾召开了全县橘农代表会议，动员橘农做到随采摘、随施肥和做好清园修枝工作。会上，橘农代表表示要把橘子全部卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。（本报浙江记者站）
