    The American Aggression Group's Phobia
　　Jiang Nan
    It seems that Mr. Lodge, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, is suffering from a phobia caused by a mad hatred of the Chinese people. He is increasingly afraid that many countries do not approve of the United States' resistance to China's representation in the United Nations, and increasingly afraid that the People's Republic of China will one day regain its legitimate seat in the United Nations. Lodge has suffered from this phobia more than once on the UN platform.
    October 24th was United Nations Day, and also the ninth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Diplomats from some countries delivered speeches on this day. This time, Lodge did not miss the opportunity. In a speech given for United Nations Day, Lodge had many things to talk about, such as how the United States' policy of using the United Nations as its rubber stamp has damaged the authority of the United Nations, and how the United States' obstruction of the People's Republic of China from entering the United Nations has weakened the role of the United Nations, etc.
    Of course, it is difficult for an American like Lodge to point out these things done by the United States. How could a criminal easily admit his own crimes? Therefore, he turned his United Nations Day speech into a complete collection of lies fabricated to slander the People's Republic of China, and gave full play to his deep hatred of the Chinese people. He insisted that China had committed sixteen so-called "major international crimes," and therefore, according to him, China was "not worthy of participating in the United Nations."
    If you want to know how incompetent American diplomats like Lodge are at fabricating lies, just look at the sixteen so-called "international crimes" that Lodge insisted China committed.
    Among these sixteen so-called "international crimes," in addition to repeating some old slanders against the new China, most of them are just pinning the crimes committed by the American aggression group itself on others. For example: the United States' aggression against Korea, the United States' interference in the Indochina War with weapons, money, and air force personnel, the United States' organization of military blocs in Southeast Asia, the conspiracy activities of interfering in the internal affairs of various countries, the United States' germ warfare in Korea, the United States' use of the most barbarous and bloody massacre methods in Korea to forcibly detain more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the United States' collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to persecute overseas Chinese and rob Chinese and foreign ships sailing along the Chinese coast. All these things that the world knows were done by the American aggression group have become things done by China in Lodge's mouth.
    Not only that, but in order to show his extraordinarily confused mind, Lodge also invented some so-called "international crimes" that have never been heard of internationally. For example, Lodge said that China hired a large number of Soviet advisors and technicians in its economic construction, China abolished the traitorous treaties concluded by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group with American imperialism, and that a large number of Chinese People's Volunteers remained in North Korea since the Korean armistice. These were all so-called "international crimes."
    Everyone except Lodge can see how absurd these slanders are. These slanders make people think that Lodge should go back to university to study international law courses, so as not to lose face and make a fool of himself on the United Nations platform. Taking the point that a large number of Chinese People's Volunteers remain in Korea, Lodge, as the representative of the United States, should know that it was not others who rejected the proposal put forward by the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and supported by China at the Geneva Conference on June 15th to withdraw foreign troops from Korea proportionally and as soon as possible, but the American representative Smith.
    Lodge's irrational outburst on United Nations Day was not without reason.
    People know that ever since the Chinese people drove away the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and established the People's Republic of China, the American aggression group has harbored deep hatred for the Chinese people. They are wholeheartedly trying to overthrow the Chinese people who have stood up, so that they can ride on the Chinese people again. They are enemies with us in military, trade, and political aspects. They violate the wishes of many countries and stubbornly resist restoring China's inherent position in the United Nations. However, with the increasing strength of the People's Republic of China, and China's increasingly significant role in maintaining world peace, more and more countries and people around the world believe that China's legitimate seat in the United Nations should be restored quickly. When the United Nations General Assembly held a vote on the credentials of the delegation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group this year, the number of abstentions, opposition, and non-participation accounted for almost 42 percent of all member states of the United Nations. This vote was the fewest votes the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group had received in such a vote since it was driven out of the mainland in 1949. Faced with this irresistible torrent, the American aggression group is very afraid, so it wants to instruct Lodge to put on a menacing face, scold the Chinese people, and try to embolden itself in this way, while intimidating other countries and forcing them to follow the United States to delay the issue of China's participation in the United Nations again and again. On a day like United Nations Day, Lodge knew that there would definitely be people who would regret that China was excluded from the United Nations, which triggered his phobia.
    But history is not created by the American aggression group. Even if the American aggression group can temporarily make the issue of restoring China's representation in the United Nations a perennial grass, it can never stop this perennial grass from flowering and bearing fruit, and the day of this flowering and bearing fruit is bound to come. This cannot but make the phobia of the likes of Lodge even more hysterical. The ruthless fact is that on the very day that Lodge scolded China and insisted that China was not worthy of participating in the United Nations, Danish Foreign Minister Hansen said in a United Nations Day broadcast what the world generally believes: the government of the People's Republic of China should represent China in the United Nations.

    美国侵略集团的恐惧症新华社评论员
  　江南
    美国驻联合国代表洛奇看来正害着一种由于疯狂仇恨中国人民而发生的恐惧症，他越来越害怕许多国家不赞成美国在联合国中抵制中国在联合国的代表权，越来越害怕中华人民共和国有朝一日会恢复它在联合国中的合法地位。在联合国讲坛上，洛奇已不止一次地发作过这种恐惧症了。
    十月二十四日是联合国日，也是联合国成立九周年的纪念日。一些国家的外交家在这一天发表了演说。这一回洛奇也没有错过机会。在一篇为联合国日而发表的演说中，洛奇本来有许多事情可以谈谈的，例如美国把联合国当做它的橡皮图章使用的政策怎样损害了联合国应有的权威；美国阻挠中华人民共和国进入联合国怎样削弱了联合国的作用等等。
    当然，要美国的洛奇来指出这些美国干下的事情是很困难的，罪犯怎会轻易承认他自己的罪行呢？因此他就把他的联合国日演说变成了一篇为了诬蔑中华人民共和国而捏造出来的谎言大全，来发挥他对中国人民的深刻仇恨。他硬说中国犯有十六件所谓“重大的国际罪行”，因此，据他说，中国“不配参加联合国”。
    如果要知道像洛奇这样的美国外交家在制造谎言这方面是怎样的低能，只要看一看洛奇硬说中国犯下的十六件所谓“国际罪行”就够了。
    在这十六件所谓“国际罪行”中间，除了重复一些老一套的对新中国的诬蔑以外，绝大部分不过是把美国侵略集团自己犯下的罪行硬栽到别人头上。例如：美国对朝鲜的侵略，美国用武器、金钱和空军人员对印度支那战争的干涉，美国在东南亚组织军事集团，干涉各国内政的阴谋活动，美国在朝鲜进行的细菌战，美国在朝鲜用最野蛮、最血腥的屠杀手段来强迫扣留四万八千多名朝中被俘人员，美国勾结蒋介石卖国集团迫害华侨、抢劫在中国沿海航行的中国和各国船只，所有这些全世界都知道是美国侵略集团干下的事情，在洛奇嘴里却都变成是中国干下的了。
    不但如此，洛奇为了表现他的出奇的头脑混乱，还发明了一些国际间从来没有听见过的所谓“国际罪行”。例如，洛奇说，中国在经济建设中聘请了大批苏联顾问和技术人员，中国废除了蒋介石卖国集团同美国帝国主义缔结的卖国条约，自从朝鲜停战以来还有大量中国人民志愿军保持在北朝鲜，都是所谓“国际罪行”。
    除了洛奇自己以外，谁都看得出这些诬蔑是多么荒唐。这些诬蔑使人觉得洛奇最好应该回到大学里去念一下国际法的课程，以免再在联合国讲坛上丢脸出丑。就以还有大量中国人民志愿军留在朝鲜这一点来说，作为美国代表的洛奇总应该知道，在六月十五日日内瓦会议上，拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表提出并得到中国支持的从朝鲜按比例尽速撤退外国军队的不是别人，正是美国代表史密斯。
    洛奇在联合国日的这种毫无理性的发作，并不是没有原因的。
    人们晓得，自从中国人民赶走了蒋介石卖国集团、建立了中华人民共和国以来，美国侵略集团就对中国人民抱着深仇大恨。他们一心想把站起来了的中国人民搬倒下来，好让他们重新骑在中国人民头上。他们从军事、贸易、政治各方面来和我们做仇人。他们违背许多国家的愿望，顽固地抵制恢复中国在联合国的固有地位。但是，随着中华人民共和国的日益强大，中国在维护世界和平中的作用日益显著，全世界越来越多的国家和人民认为应当迅速恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位。在今年联合国大会举行关于承认蒋介石卖国集团代表团的证书的表决时，反对、弃权和不参加表决的几乎占联合国全体会员国的百分之四十二。这次表决是蒋介石卖国集团从一九四九年被赶出大陆以来在这种表决中得票最少的一次。在这股不可抗拒的激流面前，美国侵略集团非常恐惧，因此要指使洛奇装出一副气势汹汹的面孔，对中国人民破口大骂，企图这样来给自己壮壮胆子，同时吓唬其他国家，强迫它们跟着美国把中国参加联合国的问题一次又一次地拖延下去。在联合国日这样的日子里，洛奇知道一定会有人对于中国被排斥在联合国之外感到遗憾，这就引起了他的恐惧症的发作。
    但是历史并不是美国侵略集团创造的。美国侵略集团纵然暂时还能够使恢复中国在联合国的代表权的问题成为多年生的草，它却绝对无法阻止这棵多年生的草开花结果，而这个开花结果的日子却是一定要到来的。这就不能不使洛奇之流的恐惧症更其带有歇斯底里的性质。无情的事实是：就在洛奇大骂中国，硬说中国不配参加联合国这一天，丹麦外交大臣汉森在联合国日广播中却说出了全世界的普遍的意见：在联合国中代表中国的应该是中华人民共和国政府。
