    China National Pharmaceutical Company Beijing Branch Expands Supply of Traditional Chinese Medicine
    China Native Produce Company Beijing Branch Establishes Traditional Chinese Medicine Wholesale Department
    In order to appropriately meet the needs of the people of the capital for medicine, China National Pharmaceutical Company Beijing Branch has successively established three traditional Chinese medicine retail departments on Funei Street, Di’anmen Street, and Chongnei Street since November of last year, and one traditional Chinese medicine wholesale department outside Chongwenmen.
    The traditional Chinese medicine retail and wholesale departments of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company supply more than 2,000 kinds of medicines, including prepared herbal slices, decoctions, pills, powders, plasters, elixirs, and medicinal wines. Among them are commonly used medicines such as Chinese angelica, Atractylodes macrocephala, rhubarb, and Ophiopogon japonicus; valuable medicines such as ginseng, bezoar, rhinoceros horn, agarwood, and deer antler; as well as Niuhuang Jiedu Pills, Niuhuang Qingxin Pills, Suhe Pills, and Huoluo Dan, etc.
    In order to carry out supply in a planned way, the three retail departments have signed supply contracts with 44 units, including the Health Department of the Ministry of Health, Beijing Tram Company, Public Bus Company, Water Company, Yanjing Paper Mill, and Tsinghua University (in addition to supplying the needs of citizens). The traditional Chinese medicine wholesale department has a processing department, which, in addition to supplying private drug dealers in Beijing who do not have processing capabilities, also supplies Tibetan saffron, Morinda officinalis, Calabash, and pearl, etc., needed by ethnic minorities in Inner Mongolia, and supplies supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong, Shanxi, and Henan provinces. To facilitate patients, the three traditional Chinese medicine retail departments have hired traditional Chinese medicine doctors, with approximately more than 200 patients visiting each day. The doctors have established a system for exchanging experience and consulting on difficult cases. The retail departments also offer free decocting services for customers.
    The state-owned traditional Chinese medicine retail departments prepare the supplied prepared herbal slices and decoctions in accordance with the formulation standards of the Ministry of Health; the prices are 10% lower than those of general Chinese medicine merchants.

    China Native Produce Company Beijing Branch established a traditional Chinese medicine wholesale department in early August to supply the needs of Beijing Pharmaceutical Company and some small and medium-sized wholesalers and retailers with processing capabilities for pharmaceutical raw materials.
    Currently, the Municipal Native Produce Company's traditional Chinese medicine wholesale department operates 180 varieties of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, including 20 kinds imported from abroad such as agarwood, bezoar, dragon's blood, and betel nut; and more than 160 kinds produced domestically such as Chinese angelica, rhubarb, licorice, Citrus grandis peel, ginseng, and musk. After the establishment of the Municipal Native Produce Company's traditional Chinese medicine wholesale department, many traditional Chinese medicine prices have been reduced. For example, Coptis chinensis, Atractylodes macrocephala, Tetrapanax papyriferus, and agarwood have all been reduced in price by more than 50%; bezoar has been reduced in price by 30%, reducing the burden on patients.
    In order to appropriately control the source of goods and meet the needs of patients, the Municipal Native Produce Company has specially dispatched purchasers to Chongqing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Inner Mongolia and other places to purchase authentic medicinal materials. At the same time, the traditional Chinese medicine wholesale department also learns about the supply volume of pharmacies through the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and appropriately supplies large, medium, and small pharmacies according to specific circumstances.
    After the establishment of the Beijing Native Produce Company's traditional Chinese medicine wholesale department, some citizens sold valuable medicinal materials that they had accumulated for many years and that are currently in short supply on the market to the wholesale department at the company's listed price. Many ethnic minorities who come to Beijing also bring valuable medicinal materials, and the traditional Chinese medicine wholesale department purchases them at reasonable prices.

    中国医药公司北京市公司扩大中药供应
    中国土产公司北京市公司设立中药批发部
    中国医药公司北京市公司为了适当供应首都人民对医药的需要，自去年十一月起，先后在阜内大街、地安门大街、崇内大街设立了中药门市部三处，在崇文门外设立中药批发部一处。
    北京市医药公司的中药门市部和批发部供应的药品有：饮片、汤剂、丸、散、膏、丹、药酒等二千多种。其中有常用药品当归、白术、大黄、麦冬；有贵重的药品人参、牛黄、犀角、沉香、鹿茸；还有牛黄解毒丸、牛黄清心丸、苏合丸、活络丹等。
    为了有计划地进行供应，三个门市部和卫生部机关卫生处、北京市电车公司、公共汽车公司、自来水公司、燕京造纸厂、清华大学等四十四个单位签订了供应合同（此外还供应市民需要）。中药批发部设有加工部，除供应北京市没有加工能力的私营药商外，还供应内蒙古少数民族所需要的藏红花、木腰子、抽葫芦、珍珠等药品，并供应山东、山西、河南省供销合作社。为了便利病人，三个中药门市部请了中医生，每天门诊的病人约有二百多人。医生们建立了交流经验和会诊疑难病症的制度。门市部还代客免费煎药。
    国营中药门市部，供应的饮片、汤剂，都按照卫生部配方标准配制；价格比一般中药商低百分之十。

    中国土产公司北京市公司在八月初设立了中药批发部一处，供应北京市医药公司及部分有加工能力的中小批发商和零售商制药原料的需要。
    现在市土产公司中药批发部经营中药材的品种有一百八十种，其中有从国外进口的沉香、牛黄、血竭、槟榔等二十种；有国内出产的当归、大黄、甘草、桔红、人参、麝香等一百六十多种。市土产公司中药批发部成立后，许多中药价格都降低了。如黄连、白术、方通草、沉香等都降价百分之五十以上；牛黄降价百分之三十，减轻了病人的负担。
    为了适当地掌握货源，供应病人的需要，市土产公司特派出采购员至重庆、广州、武汉、上海、杭州、内蒙古等地，采购地道药材。同时，中药批发部还通过国药公会了解药店的供应量，根据具体情况，适当供应大、中、小各户药店。
    北京市土产公司中药批发部成立后，有些市民把积存多年而目前市场又十分缺乏的贵重药材，按公司的牌价卖给批发部。许多来北京的少数民族人士，也带来贵重药材，中药批发部按合理价格收购。
