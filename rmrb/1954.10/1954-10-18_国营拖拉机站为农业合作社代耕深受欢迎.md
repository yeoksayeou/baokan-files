Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: State-owned agricultural machine tractor stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Henan, and Shandong provinces are currently plowing land for agricultural production cooperatives.

    Thirty-eight state-owned agricultural machine tractor stations in Heilongjiang Province have dispatched over 200 tractors and 300 threshing machines to plow land and thresh grain for collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives. The Gucheng Agricultural Machine Tractor Station in Keshan County implemented a work system that guaranteed quality, chartered vehicles, guaranteed tasks, and guaranteed time. The wheat fields plowed for the Heping Collective Farm were of consistent depth and flatness, with neat field edges, and essentially eliminated missed plowing. After harrowing, very few clods the size of fists were seen. The Fujin County Agricultural Machine Tractor Station dispatched 17 threshing machines to thresh grain for farmers in six districts of the county. The quality was good, and losses were minimal, which was well received by the local masses. The Suihua and Hailun County and District Party Committees organized over 7,000 people to visit the tractor plowing, which provided farmers with a vivid and practical education in technological reform, enhancing their enthusiasm for taking the path of collectivization.

    Nine state-owned agricultural machine tractor stations in Jilin Province are dispatching 49 tractors to plow land for farmers. It is expected that 45,000 mu can be plowed before the ground freezes. On the day that the Han'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County used tractors to plow land, many agricultural production cooperatives from across the county sent representatives to visit. Among the nine stations, five stations located in Fuyu, Dehui, Jiaohe, Lishu, and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture are newly established. The original four stations in Yushu, Hailong, Xi'an, and Huai’de collectively plowed 21,015 mu of land for farmers before autumn, with about half of the cultivated land using machine sowing and weeding. Autumn harvests confirmed that the yield of various crops cultivated with tractors significantly exceeded the average yield of local old plow cultivation.

    The four newly established state-owned agricultural machine tractor stations in Anyang, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, and Xiangcheng in Henan Province have all begun to plow land for local agricultural production cooperatives. When tractors were seen pulling five-furrow plows, disc harrows, and seeders to plow land and sow wheat, four to five thousand farmers from Anyang, Zhengzhou, and other places came to observe. From late September to early October, the four stations plowed over 6,000 mu of land. In order to strive to use tractors as soon as possible, local farmers are actively building and expanding agricultural production cooperatives. In Qiliying Township, Xinxiang County, the number of farm households participating in agricultural production cooperatives increased from 10% to 50% this year.

    Eleven state-owned agricultural machine tractor stations in Shandong Province are plowing wheat fields for local agricultural production cooperatives. The agricultural machine tractor station in Huimin Prefecture has plowed over 6,600 mu of wheat fields for 53 agricultural production cooperatives in the seventh district of Guangrao County after the wheat harvest. It is estimated that the eleven stations in the province will plow over 24,500 mu of wheat fields for 186 agricultural production cooperatives this year, and will trial machine sowing of wheat.

    国营拖拉机站为农业合作社代耕深受欢迎
    【新华社十六日讯】黑龙江、吉林、河南、山东四省各地国营农业机器拖拉机站，正为农业生产合作社代耕土地。
    黑龙江省三十八个国营农业机器拖拉机站先后出动二百多台拖拉机、三百多台脱谷机为集体农庄和农业生产合作社翻地、脱谷。克山县古城农业机器拖拉机站实行保证质量、包车、包任务、包时间的工作制度，给和平集体农庄翻的大片麦地深浅一致、平坦，地头整齐，基本上消灭了漏耕，耙后很少看见拳头大的土块。富锦县农业机器拖拉机站出动十七台脱谷机给县内六个区的农民脱谷，质量好，损失少，深受当地群众欢迎。中共绥化、海伦两县、区党委组织七千多人参观拖拉机翻地，使农民受到了一次生动而实际的技术改革的教育，提高了他们走向合作化道路的积极性。
    吉林省九个国营农业机器拖拉机站，正出动四十九台拖拉机给农民翻地。结冻前可翻完四万五千市亩。蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社用拖拉机翻地那天，全县许多农业生产合作社都派代表来参观。九个站中，设在扶余、德惠、蛟河、梨树和延边朝鲜族自治区的五个站是新建的。原有的榆树、海龙、西安、怀德四个站，秋前一共给农民翻地二万一千零十五市亩，其中约有一半耕地使用了机器播种和除草。秋收中证实：用拖拉机耕作的各种作物产量显著地超过了当地旧犁耕作的平均产量。
    河南省安阳、新乡、郑州、襄城四地新建立的四个国营农业机器拖拉机站，都已开始为当地农业生产合作社代耕土地。当拖拉机牵引着五铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机耕地和播种小麦的时候，安阳、郑州等地参观的农民就有四五千人。从九月下旬开始，到十月初为止，四个站已耕了六千多亩土地。当地农民为争取早日用上拖拉机，正在积极新建和扩建农业生产合作社。新乡县七里营乡今年参加农业生产合作社的农户由百分之十增加到百分之五十。
    山东省十一个国营农业机器拖拉机站正为当地农业生产合作社代耕麦田。惠民专区的农业机器拖拉机站在收麦后已为广饶县七区五十三个农业生产合作社代耕麦田六千六百多亩。预计，全省十一个站今年将为一百八十六个农业生产合作社代耕麦田二万四千五百多亩，并试用机器播种小麦。
