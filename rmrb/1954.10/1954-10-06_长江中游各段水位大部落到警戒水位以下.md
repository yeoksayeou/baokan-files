Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th. Water levels in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have mostly receded below the warning level. On October 3rd, the Wuhan Guan水位 (water level) receded to 26.25 meters, 5 centimeters below the warning level of 26.30 meters. On the same day, the Shashi水位 (water level) was 40.39 meters, more than two meters below the local warning level. Upstream from Jiujiang, with the exception of Huangshi and Wuxue, where the current water levels are still slightly above the warning level, all stations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have receded below the warning level. Water levels in Anqing, Wuhu, Nanjing, and other places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are also close to the warning level, within 30 to 50 centimeters. The Han River, except for X溝 (Xin Gou) in the lower reaches, has receded below the warning level along its entire length.

　　In Wuhan, the Wuhan Guan水位 (water level) exceeded the warning level on June 27th, entering the flood season, and receded below the warning level on October 3rd, a total of 100 days. It remained above the highest historical level of 28.28 meters for 58 days. Now, the threat of floods has been lifted. The riverside dikes in Hankou and Wuchang have all had their secondary dikes removed, and workers are busy repairing the docks and clearing the accumulated mud from the riverside streets. The wave-breaking wood rafts outside the Zhang Gong Dike and along the river have also been removed from the water. The highways from the city to Daijiashan, Gusaoshu, and other places have now been reopened to traffic. In the past few days, the flood prevention teams, who have returned in triumph from the front lines of flood prevention, carrying red flags for their meritorious service, have been singing songs with high spirits. As they pass through the city streets, people cast grateful glances at them, expressing warm welcomes.

    长江中游各段水位大部落到警戒水位以下
     【新华社武汉四日电】长江中游各段的水位大都退到警戒水位以下。十月三日，武汉关水位已退落到二六点二五公尺，比警戒水位二六点三零公尺降下五公分。同一天沙市水位为四零点三九公尺，已低于当地警戒水位两公尺多。自九江以上，除黄石市、武穴两地目前水位仍稍高于警戒水位外，长江中游各站已全部退落到警戒水位以下了。长江下游安庆、芜湖、南京等地的水位，也都接近于警戒水位三、五公寸。汉水除下游新沟外，已全线退到警戒水位以下。
    武汉市在六月二十七日，武汉关水位超过了警戒水位，进入汛期，到十月三日退到警戒水位以下整一百天，处在历年最高水位二十八点二八公尺以上也有五十八天。现在，洪水的威胁已经解除了。汉口和武昌的沿江堤防已全部拆除子堤，工人们纷纷在整修码头，清除沿江街道上堆积的泥土。张公堤外和沿江的防浪木排也都先后由水面上除去了。由市内通往戴家山、姑嫂树等公路，现在已恢复通车。这几天，由防汛前线整队凯旋归来的防汛队员们，扛着立功的红旗，唱着歌曲，精神昂扬；当他们穿过市街时，人们都投以感激的目光，表示热烈欢迎。
