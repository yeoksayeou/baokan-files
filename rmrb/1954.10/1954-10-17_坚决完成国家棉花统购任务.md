    Resolutely Complete the State Cotton Monopoly Purchase Task
    Wang Yueyi
    On September 14th, the Government Administration Council issued an order for the monopoly purchase of cotton, stipulating that cotton farmers, in addition to the necessary cotton for their own use and paying agricultural taxes, should sell all the cotton they produce to the state. The state commercial departments entrusted the supply and marketing cooperatives to handle the cotton monopoly purchase work. Under the leadership of local Party committees and people's governments, the supply and marketing cooperatives in cotton-producing areas made specific arrangements for the cotton monopoly purchase, carried out publicity and education among the masses of farmers, registered and arranged for cotton merchants and private cotton processing industries, adjusted the purchasing points of the supply and marketing cooperatives according to the requirements of the monopoly purchase task, organized manual cotton gins among the masses, expanded and strengthened the processing power of the cooperatives, and improved the organization and leadership of cotton processing work, preparing conditions for doing a good job in the upcoming large-scale cotton monopoly purchase work.
    Due to the excessive rainfall and insufficient sunshine this year, the maturation period of cotton is generally about half a month later than in previous years, which has greatly affected the cotton collection task in September. According to incomplete statistics, the cotton collection figures for the first twenty days of September only accounted for about 28% of the task that should have been completed in September, and it is estimated that only about 50% of the plan can be completed in September. In order to ensure the raw material needs of the textile industry, the supply and marketing cooperatives are required to "collect quickly, gin quickly, and transport quickly" in September and October. The cotton collection task in September was not well completed. In addition to the objective reason that new cotton was on the market later than in previous years, there are still the following problems in the work that must be addressed:
    First of all, in the cotton monopoly purchase work, many cadres have a blindly optimistic attitude. After the Government Administration Council's cotton monopoly purchase order was announced, some supply and marketing cooperative cadres believed that the cotton problem was not too big due to the supply and marketing cooperatives' guaranteed purchase for several years, and they relaxed their publicity and education for cotton farmers. Because we did not do enough publicity and education on cotton monopoly purchase work, in some areas, cotton farmers processed the lint cotton in their hands into cotton wadding for their own use. Some even thought that they would be inconvenienced after the cotton monopoly purchase, so they rushed to use and quickly use the cotton they harvested, turning it into cotton wadding for storage; some cotton farmers picked a lot of cotton but did not sell it, waiting and watching, etc. All these situations show that we did not conduct enough preliminary research and analysis on the changes that may be caused among the masses of farmers after the announcement of cotton monopoly purchase. In order to complete the state cotton monopoly purchase task, we must first overcome the blindly optimistic mood of the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives, fully recognize that the completion of the cotton monopoly purchase task still requires arduous and intensive work, and under the leadership of the local Party committees and governments, we should go deep into the masses, understand the situation, and solve the ideological problems among the masses and the problems in the work in a timely manner. This is the key to completing the monopoly purchase task.
    Secondly, the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives must strive to complete the monthly plan of the monopoly purchase task. The reason why the cotton purchase plan for September was not well completed is related to the lack of understanding of the importance of completing the state monopoly purchase task on a monthly basis by the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives. Many supply and marketing cooperative cadres believed that there was not much cotton on the market, or delayed opening for the processing plant, and did not actively purchase. This phenomenon must be corrected. The supply and marketing cooperatives must complete the state purchase plan on a monthly basis, especially in October, they must make up for the part of the plan that was not completed in September and complete the October plan. Otherwise, it will affect the production of textile factories and the supply of cloth. The completion of the state monopoly purchase task lies first in the cadres of the grass-roots purchasing stations. Under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, they must be mobilized intensively, and from an ideological point of view, they must realize that this year's cotton is affected by the climate, and the market rules are also different from previous years. In addition, this year is the new situation of cotton monopoly purchase. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives cannot sit at the purchasing points waiting for farmers to sell. They should go deep into every village and every household, understand the cotton picking situation of farmers, mobilize farmers to pick quickly, sell quickly, pick more and sell more, and overcome the farmers' practice of waiting to sell in bulk. The supply and marketing cooperatives should quickly collect according to the needs of the state. In terms of processing work, processing factories should not wait until a certain amount has been accumulated before starting work. Under the condition that the state requires the task to be very urgent, the supply and marketing cooperative processing plants should first ensure the task of raw materials for the state textile industry. According to the purchase situation, they can adopt the method of starting work partially first, then starting all work, or discussing with the processing workers, and adopting the method of starting work every other day or every two days, so as to avoid backlog of seed cotton. Ensure that the state's transportation plan is completed on a monthly basis. Now a large amount of cotton is about to be on the market, and the supply and marketing cooperatives should quickly arrange processing work and vigorously expand the monopoly purchase work.
    Third, we should strengthen the management of the cotton market, properly arrange cotton merchants and private cotton processing industries, and solve the problem of raw material supply and finished product purchase of native textile industry in a planned way. In the past few years, due to the result of the supply and marketing cooperatives' guaranteed purchase of cotton, the number of merchants engaged in cotton has been greatly reduced, but in different cotton-producing areas, the handling and placement of merchants, peddlers and private processing industries engaged in cotton is still a problem that needs to be solved urgently in the cotton monopoly purchase work. According to the market situation in the past half month, it shows that the management of the primary cotton market is not good enough. Some merchants engaged in cotton speculation even defied the state's order for cotton monopoly purchase, and engaged in the operation and transportation of cotton, grabbing purchases at prices higher than the state's listed prices, destroying the state's monopoly purchase policy. The supply and marketing cooperatives must cooperate with the local industrial and commercial administration departments to strengthen market management. Strict handling should be given to merchants who violate and undermine the monopoly purchase policy by operating cotton. However, the supply and marketing cooperatives should properly arrange for those merchants who used to operate cotton and have difficulty in changing their careers after the cotton monopoly purchase, according to the specific situation, or entrust them with purchasing a part on their behalf, or absorb them as temporary employees and participate in the work of the processing plant. In short, this group of merchants engaged in cotton should be properly arranged so that they do not lose their jobs. For private cotton processing industries, such as cotton ginning and cotton carding, the supply and marketing cooperatives should accept the state's entrustment to register and manage them. The supply and marketing cooperatives should stipulate appropriate processing conditions and entrust them to process cotton for the supply and marketing cooperatives, but they are strictly prohibited from processing on their own, to prevent the phenomenon of cutting corners and stealing materials and reducing the quality of cotton during processing. When planning cotton processing tasks and considering processing power, the supply and marketing cooperatives should combine their own processing plants, privately-run processing plants and the cotton ginning tools among the masses for overall consideration. Overcome the bias of supply and marketing cooperative cadres who do not consider the overall situation comprehensively and blindly run power processing plants or only calculate their own processing plants without organizing the use of private processing power.
    For the raw material supply and finished product purchase of native textile households, the policy of maintaining or compressing them should be determined according to local conditions under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels. Their raw material supply and finished product purchase should be included in the supply plan and purchase plan of the supply and marketing cooperatives as much as possible, and measures should be taken to control them to prevent the phenomenon of blind development and grabbing raw materials.
    Fourth, we should conduct experimental analysis on the cotton's fiber percentage and grade this year, and pay attention to grasping the reasonable purchase price of seed cotton. According to the analysis of the cotton collection situation in various places in September, the cotton's fiber percentage this year is generally 2 to 4 jin higher per dan of cotton than last year. Some areas are even higher than the above range. The grade is generally increased by one to two grades. Since this year's focus is on purchasing seed cotton, the areas that used to purchase lint cotton will also purchase a part of seed cotton this year. When purchasing seed cotton, pay attention to experimental analysis at any time, and grasp the purchase price of seed cotton according to the actual fiber percentage level of cotton. Purchasing this year's cotton according to last year's seed cotton conversion rate will make farmers suffer losses and encourage farmers' reluctance to sell. The cotton collection cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives should seriously and conscientiously implement the price policy of "superior grade for superior price, and grading for pricing", so that farmers can obtain reasonable prices, so as to facilitate the completion of the monopoly purchase task.
    Fifth, the supply and marketing cooperatives should strictly abide by the procedures and methods of cotton monopoly purchase, and educate farmers to understand the methods of monopoly purchase. This year's cotton collection is a monopoly purchase, and at the same time, it is also the season for cotton maturity and harvest. It is now too late and impossible to conduct "production assessment and sales assessment" among the masses of cotton farmers. The cotton harvested by farmers now needs to be sold quickly to meet the needs of the national industry. Therefore, it is necessary to give cotton farmers a sales voucher when they sell cotton, so as to calculate the amount sold by farmers and the basis for evaluation. According to the current situation in various places, some supply and marketing cooperatives have not seriously implemented the regulations on issuing sales vouchers to farmers when collecting cotton from the masses, and farmers do not know the procedures and methods of cotton monopoly purchase. After the announcement of cotton monopoly purchase, farmers only know that cotton should be sold to the state. But how to sell? When to sell? What kind of procedures are required to fulfill the monopoly purchase task? These problems are not well understood, which is also one of the reasons for encouraging farmers' reluctance to sell. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should first do a good job in the procedures that should be performed for cotton farmers during the cotton monopoly purchase, and educate farmers to overcome farmers' ideas of waiting and reluctance to sell, improve work efficiency, and strive to facilitate farmers.
    In order to successfully complete the cotton monopoly purchase task, we must also strengthen the supply of materials in cotton areas. In addition to selling the monopolized materials according to the plan and trying to make it convenient and timely for farmers, the supply and marketing cooperatives should actively cooperate with state-owned professional companies to understand the needs of farmers and strive to supply them in a timely manner. Overcome the phenomenon of backlog here and out of stock there. For commodities that state-owned companies do not operate, the cooperatives should use internal material exchange meetings to carry out internal exchange and adjustment, actively process orders from handicraftsmen, and organize local sources of goods. In terms of supply methods, we should make it convenient for farmers to sell agricultural products. Set up appropriate retail outlets at purchasing points and adopt methods such as delivering goods to the countryside to facilitate farmers' purchases.

    坚决完成国家棉花统购任务
    王越毅
    九月十四日政务院发出了棉花统购命令，规定棉农除必要的自用棉和缴纳农业税外，应把所产棉花全部卖给国家。国家商业部门并委托供销合作社办理棉花统购工作。产棉区供销合作社在各地党委和人民政府的领导下，对棉花统购进行了具体的布置，并在农民群众中进行了宣传教育；对棉商和私人棉花加工业进行了登记和安排；并根据统购任务的要求调整了供销合作社收购点，组织了群众中的人力轧花车，扩大和充实了合作社加工力量，改进了棉花加工工作的组织和领导，为做好即将到来的规模巨大的棉花统购工作准备了条件。
    由于今年雨水多，日照少，棉花的成熟期比较往年一般晚半个月左右，这就大大影响了九月份收棉任务。据不完全统计，九月前二十天的收棉数字仅占九月份应完成任务的百分之二十八，估计九月份仅能完成计划的百分之五十左右。为了保证纺织工业原料的需要，在九、十月份要求供销合作社要“快收、快轧、快运”。九月份收棉任务没有很好的完成，除新棉上市比往年迟这一客观原因外，在工作上还存在着以下必须注意解决的问题：
    首先，在棉花统购工作上，不少干部存在着盲目乐观的情绪。在政务院棉花统购命令公布后，有些供销合作社干部，认为棉花由于供销合作社几年包收，问题已不太大，就放松了对棉农的宣传教育。由于我们对棉花统购工作宣传教育不够，有的地区的棉农把自己手中的皮棉加工成絮棉留着自用了，甚至有的认为棉花统购了，怕以后自己再用不方便，收下棉花抢着先用、快用，弹成絮棉存着；有的棉农摘了很多棉花不卖，等待观望等等。所有这些情况，都说明我们对棉花宣布统购后在农民群众中所可能引起的变化，事前研究分析的不够。为了完成国家棉花统购任务，首先必须克服供销合作社干部中的盲目乐观情绪，充分认识完成棉花统购任务还必须进行艰巨的紧张的工作，应在各地党委和政府领导下，深入群众，了解情况，及时解决群众中的思想问题及工作中的问题。这是完成统购任务的关键。
    其次，供销合作社干部必须争取统购任务月度计划的完成。九月份的购棉计划所以完成不好，同供销合作社干部对按月完成国家统购任务的重要意义认识不足是有关的。不少供销合作社干部认为棉花上市不多，或为了加工厂延迟开工，而不积极收购。这种现象必须加以纠正。供销合作社必须按月完成国家收购计划，尤其在十月份必须补足九月份未完成计划的部分并完成十月份计划，不如此就会影响纺织工厂的生产，就会影响到纱布的供应。完成国家统购任务，首先在于基层收购站的干部，在各级党委，政府的领导下紧张地动员起来，从思想上认识到今年棉花受气候的影响，上市规律和历年也有所不同，加上今年实行棉花统购的新情况，供销合作社干部不能坐在收购点等待农民出售。应深入每村每户，了解农民摘棉情况，动员农民快摘、快卖，多摘多卖，克服农民等待成宗出售的做法。供销合作社则应根据国家的需要快收。在加工工作上，加工工厂不要等集积一定数量再开工。在国家要求任务很迫切的情况下，供销合作社加工厂应首先保证国家纺织工业原料的任务下，可根据收购情况，采用先部分开工，后全部开工，或和加工工人商量，采用隔日或隔两日开工办法，务求做到不积压籽棉。保证按月完成国家的运交计划。现在棉花就要大量上市，供销合作社应迅速布置加工工作，大力展开统购工作。
    第三，应加强棉花市场的管理，妥善安排棉花商贩和私营棉花加工业，有计划地解决土纺土织的原料供应和成品收购问题。几年来由于供销合作社包收棉花的结果，经营棉花的商人虽大大地减少了，但在不同的棉产区，经营棉花的商人小贩和私人加工业的处理和安置，还是棉花统购工作中急待解决的问题。根据最近半个月来的市场情况，说明棉花初级市场的管理是不够好的。从事棉花投机的商贩，还有的竟违抗国家统购棉花的命令，经营、贩运棉花以高出国家的牌价进行抢购，破坏国家统购政策。供销合作社必须配合当地工商行政管理部门，加强市场管理。对于违反和破坏统购政策经营棉花的商贩，给予严格处理。但供销合作社对过去经营棉花的商贩，由于棉花统购后，无可经营，转业有困难的，应根据具体情况予以安置或委托代购一部，或吸收成为临时雇员及参加加工厂工作。总之对这一批经营棉花商贩应予以适当安置，不使失业。对私人棉花加工业，如轧花、弹花，供销合作社应接受国家委托对它们进行登记，和管理供销合作社对私人棉花加工业应规定适当的加工条件委托其为供销合作社加工棉花，但严禁其自营加工，防止其代加工中偷工，偷料，降低棉花质量现象发生。供销合作社计划棉花加工任务和考虑加工力量时，应把自有加工厂，私人经营加工厂和群众中的轧花工具结合一起，通盘考虑。克服供销合作社干部不通盘考虑全面情况而盲目举办动力加工厂或只计算自己加工厂不组织利用私人加工力量的偏向。
    对土纺土织户的原料供应和成品收购，应在各级党委和政府领导下，因地制宜决定维持或压缩的方针，对其原料供应和成品收购，应尽可能纳入供销合作社供应计划和收购计划，并采取措施予以控制，防止盲目发展和抢购原料的现象。
    第四，对今年棉花衣分、品级应进行试验分析，注意掌握籽棉的合理收购价格。据九月份各地收棉情况分析，今年棉花衣分较之去年每一担棉花普遍高二斤到四斤。有的地区甚至还高过以上幅度。品级一般提高一级到两级。由于今年实行以收购籽棉为主，过去习惯收购皮棉地区，今年也将收购一部籽棉。收购籽棉时，随时注意试验分析，根据棉花实际衣分等级，掌握好籽棉的收购价。根据去年籽皮棉折合率收购今年棉花，将会使农民吃亏，而助长农民惜售思想。供销合作社收棉干部应严肃认真地贯彻“优级优价，分等给价”的价格政策，务使农民获得合理的价格，以利统购任务的完成。
    第五，对棉花统购的手续和办法，供销合作社应严格遵守，并教育农民了解统购的办法。今年收棉由于是统购，同时由于现在又正是棉花成熟收获季节，现在还来不及也不可能在棉农群众中进行
  “评产评售”。农民现在收获的棉花，又需要他们迅速卖出以满足国家工业的需要，因之在农民出售棉花时，就有必要给予棉农以出售凭证，以备计算农民出售数量及评议的根据。根据现在各地进行情况，有些地区供销合作社在收进群众棉花时，并未认真执行开给农民售棉凭证的规定，农民也不知道统购棉花的手续和办法。宣布棉花统购后，农民仅知道棉花应卖给国家。但怎样卖？什么时候卖？经过怎样的手续才顶统购任务？这些问题还不十分了解，这也是助长农民惜售思想的原因之一。各地供销合作社应首先做好在棉花统购时对棉农应履行的手续，并对农民进行教育，以克服农民的等待惜售思想，提高工作效率，力求便利农民。
    为顺利完成棉花统购任务，还必须加强棉区物资供应工作。除统销物资应根据计划出售并尽量做到对农民的方便及时外，对其他物资供销合作社应积极主动和国营各专业公司，密切配合，了解农民的需要，争取及时供应。克服这里积压，那里脱销的现象。国营公司不经营的商品，合作社应利用内部物资交流会，进行内部交流调剂，积极向手工业者加工订货，组织地方货源。在供应方式上，应做到使农民出售农产品方便。在收购点设置适当的零售点，采用送货下乡等方式，以便利农民的购买。
