Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 25th: General Yang Yong, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, wrote an article entitled "Continue to Struggle for a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue" for the Korean "Rodong Sinmun" and other newspapers on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war in Korea.

    General Yang Yong, in his article, recounted the positive proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward again by the Chinese and Soviet governments in their joint declaration issued on October 12th, and said: For more than a year since the armistice, the American aggressor group has been trying its best to pursue a policy of keeping the Korean armistice in an unstable state, and has been trying its best to create all kinds of disputes and provocations that violate and undermine the armistice agreement, actively expanding the armed forces of the Syngman Rhee traitorous group, and encouraging this traitorous group to repeatedly issue calls for resuming the war. However, under the high vigilance and close surveillance of the Korean People's Army and our army, the enemy's conspiracy will ultimately not succeed. The Korean and Chinese People's Armies continue to maintain the Korean armistice, and while maintaining the armistice, they continue to maintain their vigilance against the enemy. The article said: The facts of the past year and more since the armistice have shown the consistent sincerity of the Korean and Chinese people in strictly abiding by the armistice agreement and striving for a further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; at the same time, they have also shown that the Korean and Chinese people have sufficient strength and confidence to achieve this goal. The withdrawal of seven divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea back to China not only demonstrates the sincerity of the Chinese people in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, but also demonstrates the strong strength and confidence of the Chinese and Korean people in jointly completing this task. There is no doubt that the volunteer soldiers and commanders who continue to stay in Korea will never fail the trust of the people of the motherland and the expectations of the Korean people.

    General Yang Yong said in his article: On the occasion of commemorating the fourth anniversary of going abroad to fight, our army's commanders and fighters feel extremely gratified and joyful at the tremendous achievements made by the Korean people in post-war recovery and construction work. Every soldier and commander clearly remembers: when they crossed the Yalu River four years ago, they personally saw countless beautiful Korean cities and villages turned into rubble and ruins under the bombing and burning of American aggressors' heavy bombs and napalm bombs. This situation once aroused the boundless anger of our army's commanders and fighters against the enemy, and turned into a huge combat force. At that time, our army's commanders and fighters had made a vow: not only to defeat the American aggressors together with the Korean people, but also to restore the destroyed beautiful cities and villages together with the Korean people. Today, only a little over a year after the armistice, many Korean cities and villages have rapidly changed their wartime appearance due to the timely formulation and implementation of the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the people's economy by the government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. All of this is greatly encouraging our army's commanders and fighters to fight together with the heroic Korean People's Army to better defend the peaceful labor of the Korean people.

    General Yang Yong said in his article: The great achievements of the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, which closed victoriously not long ago, have made us even more excited when we welcome the fourth anniversary of going abroad to fight. We are extremely proud to see that the meeting passed the constitution of our people. The constitution stipulates the goal and specific path for our country to be built into a great socialist country, and this is precisely the bright and happy future of the motherland that we are willing to defend with our lives. We are also extremely excited to see that in the four years we have been away from our motherland, with the achievements of the motherland's economic recovery and construction, our national defense forces have also been greatly strengthened. A major historical task yet to be completed in our people's liberation cause – the task of liberating Taiwan – has been put on the agenda. The people of the motherland have launched huge efforts in all aspects to liberate Taiwan, and our struggle in Korea is the best support for our people to liberate Taiwan. Every victory in the struggle to liberate Taiwan will further promote the cause of consolidating peace in Asia and the world, thereby having a positive effect on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. As the loyal sons and daughters of the motherland, all the commanders and fighters of our army will redouble their vigilance and strive to complete the sacred task entrusted by the motherland – to continue to work with the heroic Korean people to maintain the Korean armistice and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    继续为实现朝鲜问题的和平解决而斗争
    ——杨勇将军为朝鲜“劳动新闻”撰写的文章的摘要
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】中国人民志愿军副司令员杨勇将军在中国人民志愿军出国作战四周年纪念日为朝鲜“劳动新闻”等报刊撰写了题为“继续为实现朝鲜问题的和平解决而斗争”的文章。
    杨勇将军在文章中叙述了中苏两国政府十月十二日在发表的联合宣言中再次提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的积极建议后说：停战一年多来，美国侵略集团一直竭力奉行使朝鲜停战处于不稳定状态的政策，竭力制造各式各样的违犯与破坏停战协定的纠纷和挑衅，积极扩充李承晚卖国集团的武装力量，并鼓励这个卖国集团一再发出恢复战争的叫嚣。但是在朝鲜人民军和我军的高度警惕和严密监视之下，敌人的阴谋终不能得逞。朝中人民军队继续维护着朝鲜的停战，并且在维护停战的同时，不断地继续保持着自己对于敌人的警惕。文章说：停战一年多来的事实，表明了朝中人民一贯严格遵守停战协定，并努力谋求进一步和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意；同时，也表明了朝中人民有充分的力量和信心达到这一目的。中国人民志愿军七个师从朝鲜撤出回国，不仅表明了中国人民对和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，而且也表明了中国人民和朝鲜人民对共同完成这一任务具有坚强的力量和信心。毫无疑义，继续留在朝鲜的志愿军指战员，是决不会辜负祖国人民的信任和朝鲜人民的期望的。
    杨勇将军在文章中说：在纪念出国作战四周年的时候，我军指战员对朝鲜人民在战后恢复和建设工作中所取得的巨大成就，感到无比的欣慰和欢悦。每个指战员都清楚记得：在四年前跨过鸭绿江的时候，亲眼看到无数朝鲜美丽的城市和乡村，在美国侵略者的重磅炸弹和凝固汽油弹的轰炸燃烧之下，变成了一片片的瓦砾和废墟。这种情景，曾经激起了我军指战员对敌人无比的愤怒，而变成了巨大战斗力量。就在那个时候，我军指战员就曾许下心愿：不仅要和朝鲜人民一起来打败美国侵略者，而且要和朝鲜人民一起来恢复破坏了的美丽的城市和乡村。在今天停战仅一年多的时候，由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和人民及时制订和执行了人民经济恢复与发展的三年计划，朝鲜的许多城市和乡村就已经迅速改变了战时的面貌。这一切，都在极大地鼓舞着我军指战员和英雄的朝鲜人民军在一起，为更好地保卫朝鲜人民的和平劳动而奋斗。
    杨勇将军在文章中说：在不久以前胜利闭幕的中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议所获得的伟大成果，使我们在迎接出国作战四周年的时候，更加百倍兴奋。我们无比自豪地看到会议通过了我国人民的宪法。宪法规定了我国要建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的目标和具体道路，而这正是我们不惜以生命来保卫的祖国的光明幸福的未来。我们也无比兴奋地看到在我们远离祖国的四年中，随着祖国经济恢复和建设的成就，我们的国防力量也已大为增强。我国人民解放事业中尚待完成的一项重大历史性任务——解放台湾的任务，已经提到日程上来。祖国人民已经展开了为解放台湾而努力的各方面巨大工作，而我们在朝鲜所进行的斗争，也正是对我国人民解放台湾的最好的支援。在解放台湾的斗争中的每一胜利，又都将进一步促进巩固亚洲与世界和平的事业，从而对和平解决朝鲜问题发生积极的作用。作为祖国忠实儿女的我军全体指战员，定将百倍地提高警惕，为完成祖国所付托的神圣任务——继续与英雄的朝鲜人民一起，维护朝鲜停战、并争取和平解决朝鲜问题——而奋斗。
