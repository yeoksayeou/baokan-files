Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam: A reporter from this agency reports from Hanoi: In the two months before the liberation of Hanoi, the working class of Hanoi waged a heroic and tenacious struggle to protect public property and maintain the stability of the people's lives.

Since the signing of the Geneva Accords, the reactionary French political forces in Hanoi have instigated the Hanoi Electricity Company, Water Company, Tram Company, Train Company, and Gia Lam Train Repair Factory, as well as other companies, to adopt measures such as stopping coal purchases, laying off employees, or dismantling and transporting machinery, in an attempt to cut off water and electricity and paralyze transportation in Hanoi after liberation. However, these acts of sabotage were unanimously opposed by the workers. They jointly petitioned, sent representatives to reason, and resolutely demanded continued business operations to ensure the normal lives of the people. At the same time, they also launched a series of struggles to protect factories and protect machinery.

Around September 20, the workers of the Gia Lam Train Repair Factory repeatedly blocked trains carrying machinery from the factory from heading to Haiphong. On October 1st, a driver at the Hoan Kiem Lake substation of the Electricity Company refused to drive to transport machinery. A French supervisor then drove the crane himself and loaded a generator capable of supplying electricity to a province. However, more than 200 workers immediately surrounded him and demanded that he put it down. The workers persisted from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, and finally won the victory. In the days before the liberation of Hanoi, the workers of the Electricity, Water, and Train companies simply did not go home. They ate and slept in the factories and formed factory protection self-defense teams. When the French army came to dismantle the machines, they formed an unbreakable circle, tightly protecting the machines. The workers' struggle continued until the liberation of Hanoi on October 9th. Due to this struggle, the supply of water and electricity in the city was never interrupted before and after the liberation of Hanoi, and trams and trains quickly resumed normal operation after liberation.

Many facilities of enterprises and schools originally operated by the French were also preserved under the struggle of workers and students. Although the Central Pharmaceutical Institute was looted of nearly 2,000 boxes of medicines and instruments by officials of the Ngo Dinh Diem government, the workers refused to pack them or replaced them with bad medicines and empty bottles, preserving more medicines, instruments, and pharmaceutical machinery. The employees of Phu Doan Hospital were forced to pack many instruments and medicines, but when the officials of the Ngo Dinh Diem government were not paying attention, they drove the cars loaded with these things to the liberated areas. The employees of the North Vietnamese Agricultural Institute also used the same method to drive many experimental instruments, materials, and cars to the liberated areas.

The Hanoi Opera House, which has a history of 43 years, and many cinemas were also intact under the protection of the employees. Members of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique had put thousands of "refugees" forcibly migrated from neighboring provinces into the Hanoi Opera House and did not give them firewood for more than a month, in an attempt to use their hands to destroy the opera house. However, under the persuasion and careful protection of the opera house employees, the "refugees" rarely entered the stage and seating area, and always ate and slept only in the corridors of the courtyard and under the eaves outside the building. In more than a month, there was no damage in the courtyard except for two wooden chairs and four velvet cushions.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 19th: Public life in Hanoi is rapidly returning to normal.

The working class of Hanoi, which made significant contributions to the struggle to protect factories, is participating in the work of restoring the normal life of the capital with unprecedented labor enthusiasm. Public utility workers are working actively to ensure the city's water and electricity supply and urban transportation. Power plant workers are paying more attention to protecting machinery and preventing all accidents and sabotage. The workers also put forward two suggestions for saving coal, one of which saved 3% of fuel. Thanks to the efforts of the workers of the Tram Company, the tram has been extended from Hanoi to Ha Dong city, whereas previously only half of this line was open to traffic.

In recent days, shops in the main commercial district of Hanoi – the Thirty-Six Streets – have reopened one after another. Chinese, Indian, and French shops have also opened for business. Since the Municipal Military and Administrative Committee announced the abolition of the unreasonable tax items of the former French and Bao Dai authorities, industrialists, businessmen, and vendors have increased their enthusiasm for business. Some businessmen who were deceived into fleeing to South Vietnam before liberation have returned to Hanoi.

Employees who originally worked in the Bao Dai regime's institutions have also returned to their original agencies to report. As of the 14th, nearly all agencies have retained more than half of their personnel, and some agencies have retained more than 80% of their personnel.

    在护厂斗争和恢复正常公共生活的工作中
    河内的工人阶级作出了重大贡献
     【新华社北越讯】本社记者自河内报道：河内解放前的两个多月中，河内工人阶级为保护公共财产和维护人民生活秩序的安定曾进行了英勇顽强的斗争。
    自从日内瓦协定签订后，河内的法方反动政治势力即策动河内电力公司、自来水公司、电车公司、火车公司和嘉林火车修理厂以及其他公司等采取停止购煤、解雇职工或拆运机器的手段，企图使河内在解放后水、电断绝，交通瘫痪。但是这些破坏行为受到职工们一致反对。他们联名请愿，派代表去说理，坚决要求继续营业，保障人民的正常生活，同时还展开了一系列的保护工厂、保护机器的斗争。
    九月二十日前后，嘉林火车修理厂的职工们曾数次阻挡了搬运厂内机器的火车向海防开驶。十月一日，电力公司还剑湖变电所的一个司机拒绝开车去搬运机器，法籍监工就自己开车用吊机装上一部能供应一个省城的电力的发电机，但是二百多名工人立即把他包围起来，要求他放下。工人们从上午十时坚持到下午六时，终于获得了胜利。河内解放前几天，电力、自来水、火车等公司的工人干脆不回家，他们就在厂内吃饭、睡觉，并组成护厂自卫队。法军来拆机器时，他们就围起打不散的圈子，紧紧地保护着机器。工人们的斗争一直坚持到十月九日河内解放。由于这种斗争，在河内解放前后，全市水、电的供应一直没有中断，电车和火车在解放后很快就恢复正常行驶。
    许多原由法方经营的企业和学校的设备，在工人和学生们的斗争下，也被保存了下来。中央药院虽然被吴庭艳政府的官员们劫运了近两千箱的药品和仪器，但是工人们曾拒绝装箱或以坏药和空瓶代替，保存了更多的药品、仪器、制药机器。府尹医院的职工们被迫装起了许多仪器和药品，但乘吴庭艳政府官员们不注意时，把装载着这些东西的汽车开往解放区。北越农耕所的职工们也用同样办法，把许多实验仪器、资料连同汽车一起开往解放区。
    已有四十三年历史的河内大戏院以及许多电影院，在职工们的护卫下也完好无损。吴庭艳集团的分子曾把数千名从邻近省份强迫迁移来的“难民”放进河内大戏院，一个多月内不给他们柴烧，企图借他们的手来破坏这座戏院，但是在戏院职工们的劝导和小心保护下，“难民”们很少进入舞台和场座，始终只在院内走廊上和楼外廊檐下吃饭睡觉。一个多月中，院内除了两把木椅和四块绒垫外毫无损坏。
    【新华社河内十九日电】河内公共生活正迅速恢复正常。
    在护厂斗争中有重大贡献的河内市工人阶级正以前所未有的劳动热情参加恢复首都的正常生活的工作。公用事业工人积极努力，保证了全市水、电供应和市内交通。发电厂工人加倍注意保护机器，防止一切意外和破坏。工人们还提出了两项节约煤炭的建议，其中一项就使燃料节省百分之三。在电车公司工人的努力下，电车已从河内直通河东市，以前这段线路只有一半通车。
    这几天来，河内市主要商业区——三十六条街坊的店铺纷纷恢复营业。华侨、印侨和法侨商店也先后开门营业。自从市军政委员会宣布废除以前法国和保大当局的不合理税收项目以后，工商业主和商贩们已提高了经营的积极性。在解放前受骗逃往南越的商人，有些已经回到河内。
    原在保大政权机构中工作的职员，也纷纷回到原机关报到。到十四日为止，几乎所有机关半数以上人员已经被留用，有不少机关留用人员达百分之八十以上。
