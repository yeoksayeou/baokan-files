Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: The U.S. authorities formally handed over the first batch of approximately one hundred landing craft, prepared for the Chiang Kai-shek gang, on the 9th, to strengthen the military power of the Chiang bandit troops. According to Agence France-Presse, Chase, head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, when presiding over the handover of these ships to the Chiang Kai-shek gang, also clamored arrogantly that the U.S. military and the Chiang bandit troops "stand shoulder to shoulder" to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan.

    美国交给蒋匪帮一批登陆艇
    【新华社十日讯】美国当局已在九日把准备给予蒋匪帮的约一百艘登陆艇中的第一批正式移交给蒋匪帮，以加强蒋贼军的军事力量。据法新社报道，美国驻台湾的军事援助顾问团团长蔡斯在主持把这些船只移交给蒋匪帮时，还狂妄地叫嚣说，美国军队和蒋贼军“肩并肩地站在一起”，以阻挠中国人民解放台湾。
