Tianjin District Water Transport Area Special Court
Publicly Sentences "Lincheng Wheel" Grounding Case, Causing National Property Damage

    On October 5th, the Tianjin District Water Transport Area Special Court publicly sentenced Jin Zhiren, the former captain of the "Lincheng Wheel," in Xin'gang for violating operational regulations, causing the ship to run aground and resulting in significant damage to national property. Leaders from the Municipal People's Court, the Municipal People's Procuratorate, and the Tianjin District Port Authority, along with over seven hundred workers, sailors, and seamen from Xin'gang, attended the public sentencing hearing.

    At the public sentencing hearing, the presiding judge, assessors, representative of the procurator-general, and defense attorney repeatedly interrogated and questioned the defendant, related parties, and witnesses regarding the specific details of the case. Subsequently, in accordance with Article 76 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which states that "the accused has the right to defense," the prosecuting attorney, representing the procurator-general, and the defendant's defense attorney engaged in debate. After the debate concluded, the judges temporarily adjourned to deliberate. Following deliberation, the presiding judge announced the verdict. The verdict stated: "The 'Lincheng Wheel' sailed from Yantai to Qinhuangdao on February 28, 1954. Due to the defendant Jin Zhiren's dereliction of duty, he failed to check the voyage log during the voyage and remained unaware of problems discovered during the voyage. When encountering fog, he also failed to comply with fog navigation rules by sounding the foghorn every two minutes. Upon noticing unusual splashes and already being aware that the ship was navigating in an unsafe area, he failed to measure the water depth and recklessly proceeded at full speed, resulting in the ship running aground near Jinshan Point on March 1st. After running aground, the defendant Jin Zhiren failed to take effective measures to immediately drop the stern anchor, resulting in a second, more severe loss to the ship and cargo. According to statistics, the total loss of cargo and ship damage amounted to over 11 billion yuan." The verdict continued: "In order to ensure the smooth operation of water transport and to educate maritime employees to strengthen their sense of responsibility and avoid maritime incidents, strict punishment should be imposed in accordance with the law. However, considering that the defendant's past performance was relatively positive and that the first mate Chen Xiufu and the second mate Fang Yutao also bear some responsibility for the occurrence of this accident, lenient treatment is granted. Jin Zhiren is hereby sentenced to two years imprisonment with a two-year reprieve to observe his future conduct. The Procuratorate has recommended that the leading authorities of the 'Lincheng Wheel' impose appropriate sanctions on other relevant derelict personnel, but not subject them to criminal penalties."

    天津区水运沿线专门法院
    公判“临城轮”触礁造成国家财产损失案件
    天津区水运沿线专门法院，十月五日在新港公判前“临城轮”船长金知人违反操作规程，致使船只触礁搁浅，造成国家财产重大损失的案件。出席公判法庭旁听的有市人民法院、市人民检察署和天津区港务管理局的领导同志以及新港的工人、船员、水手共七百余人。
    在公判法庭上，审判长、陪审员、检察长代表、辩护人等，对案件的具体情节，反复地审讯和询问了被告、关系人及证人，随即根据中华人民共和国宪法第七十六条“被告人有权获得辩护”的规定，由公诉人检察长代表和被告辩护人进行了辩论。辩论终结，审判人员暂时退庭评议。评议后，审判长宣读了判决。判决中指出：“临城轮”于一九五四年二月二十八日由烟台开往秦皇岛，因被告金知人玩忽职守，在航行中不看航程日志，对航行中发现的问题盲然不知；在遇雾的时候，也不遵照雾中航行规则每隔两分钟拉一次雾号；在发现水花有异，已经知道船已航行在不安全地带的时候，也不测水，仍贸然以全速前进，以致该轮于三月一日在金山咀附近触礁，触礁后，被告金知人又未采取有效措施立即下尾锚，以致船货遭到第二次更严重的损失。据统计，货损、船损等共计一百一十亿余元。判决中继续指出：为了保障水上运输的顺利进行，并教育广大海事员工加强工作责任心，避免海事事件发生，本应依法严惩；但鉴于被告人过去表现尚属积极，这次事故的发生，大副陈修复、二副方玉涛也负有一定责任，为此特从宽处理。依法判处金知人徒刑二年，缓刑二年，以观后效。对其他有关失职人员，检察署已建议“临城轮”的领导机关予以适当处分，不予刑事处分。
