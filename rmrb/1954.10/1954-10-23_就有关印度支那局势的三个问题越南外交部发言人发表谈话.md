Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 22nd: The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam answered questions raised by a reporter from the Vietnam News Agency on October 22, 1954. The full text is as follows:

Question 1: What is your view on the Manila Treaty and the inclusion of Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into the treaty's area of application? What is your view on France's participation in this treaty?

Answer: Before and during the Geneva Conference, American interventionists attempted to establish an aggressive military bloc in Southeast Asia with the aim of obstructing the conference from reaching an agreement and prolonging and expanding the Indochina War according to their instructions. However, their attempts failed. The Geneva Conference has achieved agreements aimed at restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of Indochina. Since American interventionists failed to sabotage the signing of these agreements, they are now trying to hinder the implementation of the agreed terms, create conditions for further American intervention in Southeast Asia, and turn the countries in this region into American military bases and colonies. This is the political implication of the Manila Conference and the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty.

As everyone knows, it was the United States that prepared to convene the Manila Conference and draft the treaty, and Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon not only refused to join the treaty but also condemned its aggressive intentions.

Article 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference stipulates that the contracting parties of Vietnam "shall ensure that the areas assigned to them shall not participate in any military alliances and shall not be used to resume hostilities or serve an aggressive policy."

The governments of Cambodia and Laos have also issued similar statements.

However, the Manila Treaty, especially the protocol attached to the treaty, unilaterally violates the Geneva agreements by including Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty's area of implementation.

This is a blatant violation of the Geneva agreements, infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and threatening the security and peace of the people of Southeast Asia.

Therefore, the Soviet Foreign Ministry has correctly pointed out in its statement on September 14, 1954, that including these clauses (that is, Articles 4 and 8 of the Manila Treaty and the attached protocol) in the treaty clearly demonstrates their obvious intention to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements on Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, said in his report to the National People's Congress of China on September 23, 1954, that the inclusion of Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam into the "protected" area of the Southeast Asia group is a conspiracy to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements on Indochina.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in the Indian Parliament on September 29, 1954, that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has turned a peaceful region into a region where war may occur.

However, Mr. Guy La Chambre, Minister of the French Federal Member States Relationship Department, the French representative attending the Manila Conference, and the signatory of the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty, said: "It (France - editor's note) has every reason to be satisfied with the signing of the protocol on the member states of the Indochina Federation."

"According to this protocol, these countries and their territories, although not yet members of the new organization, have the right to enjoy the provisions in Articles 3 and 4 of the treaty. This means that these countries can receive the economic and technical assistance stipulated in this treaty, and it also means that the guarantees provided by this treaty in the event of aggression will apply to the entire territory of these countries."

The Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina do not agree with these words, which are inconsistent with the obligations undertaken by the French government in Geneva.

Question 2: How should we understand General Paul Ely's statement to the French press on August 30, 1954: "The ceasefire has not changed the purpose of France's policy in Indochina"?

Answer: Before the Geneva Conference, the purpose of France's policy in Indochina was to implement colonial reconquest under the increasing intervention of American imperialists. This policy was subordinate to Washington's desire to prolong and expand the Indochina War. However, this policy was defeated in the face of the victorious resistance war of the people of Indochina. The Geneva Conference was convened, and during the conference, France implemented a new policy that contributed to the success of the Geneva negotiations. The French government signed agreements to cease hostilities in the three countries of Indochina. It also promised to respect the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of these countries. However, General Paul Ely said in his speech: "The ceasefire has not changed the purpose of France's policy in Indochina," and he also said: "France's assistance to South Vietnam should be coordinated with American assistance," and there will also be military assistance.

The policy mentioned by General Paul Ely is inconsistent with the policy pursued by the French government at the Geneva Conference and the spirit of the agreements signed by the French government. This policy tends to follow the Washington line as in the period before the Geneva Conference.

Question 3: What is the attitude of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people towards the French-American talks held in Washington at the end of September 1954?

Answer: After the signing of the Manila Treaty, Mr. Guy La Chambre and General Paul Ely went to Washington to negotiate with the United States on the issue of providing economic and military assistance to the French Expeditionary Force and the member states of the Indochina Federation.

One of the things revealed in the French-American talks communique is that the French government agreed that American aid would be directly given to the member states of the Indochina Federation, which means that American imperialists are increasingly intensifying their intervention in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

When talking about this meeting, the French minister said that the French government and the American government had completely consistent views on the Indochina issue.

The French minister also said: "We recognized in the talks that we are fighting the same struggle for freedom in Vietnam and that full coordination and full cooperation should be carried out."

This is the usual tone in the period before the Geneva Conference.

For American interventionists, the "struggle for freedom" means continuing and expanding the Indochina War. After the Geneva Conference, judging from the above facts, the "struggle for freedom" means, for American imperialists, making efforts to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements.

The Washington talks not only proved that the United States is determined to follow a policy of aggression against the people of Indochina, but also proved that in following this policy that denies the Geneva agreements, the United States has found some diligent collaborators among the French ruling groups.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly oppose this aggressive policy against the basic rights of the Vietnamese people that the United States has been constantly pursuing. The purpose of this policy in the past was to prolong and expand the Indochina War. At present, its purpose is to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements, hinder the establishment of stable and lasting peace in Indochina, create an unstable situation in this peninsula, seriously threaten the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the countries of Indochina, and threaten their security and peace.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are determined to faithfully and strictly implement the Geneva agreements. At the same time, they are resolutely fighting to ensure that all parties concerned faithfully and strictly implement these agreements, and resolutely oppose all acts that violate the Geneva agreements.

Although some members of the French ruling group tend to pursue a policy that violates the letter and spirit of the Geneva agreements and is closer to Washington, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people have decided to adopt a policy of consultation towards France, which has already achieved good results at the Geneva Conference. They hope to establish economic and cultural relations with France on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and are willing to resolve the issue of France's interests in Vietnam in according to the principles mentioned in the letters exchanged between Mr. Pham Van Dong and Mr. Mendès-France in Geneva. We firmly believe that the French people and all peace-loving people in France will firmly support this policy.

In the struggle to correctly implement the Geneva agreements, to establish stable and lasting peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of Indochina, and to establish trust and friendly relations with France, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people know that they are supported by the French people, the people and governments of Southeast Asian countries, and the people and governments of all peace-loving countries in the world.

    就有关印度支那局势的三个问题
    越南外交部发言人发表谈话
   【新华社二十二日讯】越南通讯社河内二十二日讯：越南民主共和国外交部发言人于一九五四年十月二十二日答复越南通讯社记者提出的问题，全文如下：
    问题一：你对于马尼拉条约和把老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部划入这个条约的适用区域的做法怎样看法？你对于法国参加这个条约怎样看法？
    答：在日内瓦会议之前和开会期间，美国干涉主义分子曾想在东南亚建立一个侵略性军事集团，目的是阻挠会议达成协议，并依照他们的指示延长和扩大印度支那战争。但是他们的企图失败了。日内瓦会议已达成了目的在于在承认印度支那各国人民的民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那和平的协议。由于美国干涉主义分子未能破坏这些协议的签订，他们正在设法阻碍已达成的条款的实施，为美国进一步干涉东南亚创造条件，并把这个地区的国家变为美国的军事基地和殖民地。这就是马尼拉会议和所谓东南亚防务条约的政治含意。
    大家知道，准备召开马尼拉会议和拟订草约的是美国，而像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰这样的东南亚国家不仅拒绝依附这个条约，而且还斥责了它的侵略目的。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言第五条规定：越南的签约双方“应注意，务使划归他们的地区不参加任何军事同盟，并不被用来恢复敌对行动或服务于侵略政策。”
    柬埔寨和老挝政府也发表了类似的声明。
    但是，马尼拉条约，特别是这个条约所附的议定书已片面地违反日内瓦会议的协议，把老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部划入所谓东南亚防务条约的实施范围之内。
    这是公然破坏日内瓦协议，侵犯越南、老挝和柬埔寨的独立和主权，威胁东南亚各国人民的安全和和平。
    因此，苏联外交部已经在它一九五四年九月十四日的声明中正确地指出，把这些条款（这就是马尼拉条约第四条和第八条以及附加的议定书）列入这个条约中就明确地证明他们显然想阻挠关于老挝、柬埔寨和越南的日内瓦协议的实施。
    中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来一九五四年九月二十三日在他向中国全国人民代表大会所作的报告中说，把柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部划入东南亚集团的“保护”区域是一个企图阻挠实施日内瓦关于印度支那的协议的阴谋。
    印度总理尼赫鲁一九五四年九月二十九日在印度国会说，东南亚条约组织把一个和平地区变成了一个可能发生战争的地区。
    但是，联邦成员国关系部部长、法国出席马尼拉会议代表和所谓东南亚防务条约签字人居伊·拉香波先生说过：“它（法国——编者）有充分的理由对关于印度支那联邦成员国的议定书的签订感到满意。
    “根据这个议定书，这些国家和它们的领土虽然还不是这个新组织的成员，却有权利享受条约第三条和第四条中的规定。这意味着，这些国家可以得到这个条约中规定的经济和技术援助，也意味着这个条约在发生侵略时所提供的保证将适用于这些国家的全部领土。”
    越南人民和印度支那各国人民不同意这些不符合法国政府在日内瓦所承担的义务的话。
    问题二：我们应如何理解保罗·埃利将军一九五四年八月三十日向法国报界发表的声明：“停火并没有改变法国在印度支那的政策的目的”？
    答：在日内瓦会议以前，法国在印度支那的政策的目的是在美帝国主义者愈来愈深入干涉印度支那的情况下实行殖民主义再征服。这种政策是从属于希望拖延并扩大印度支那战争的华盛顿的。但是，在印度支那人民胜利的抗战面前，这种政策遭到了失败。日内瓦会议召开了，在会议期间，法国执行了新的政策，这种政策促成了日内瓦谈判的成功。法国政府签订了在印度支那三国停止敌对行动的协定。它还答应尊重这些国家的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。但是保罗·埃利将军在他的谈话中说：“停火并没有改变法国在印度支那的政策的目的”，他又说：“法国对越南南部的援助应当同美国的援助相配合”，还将有军事援助。
    保罗·埃利将军所说的政策是不符合于法国政府在日内瓦会议上所奉行的政策和法国政府签订的协议的精神的。这种政策倾向于遵循像在日内瓦会议以前的时期那样的华盛顿路线。
    问题三：越南民主共和国政府和越南人民对一九五四年九月底在华盛顿举行的法美谈判的态度如何？
    答：在马尼拉条约签订以后，居伊·拉香波先生和保罗·埃利将军曾前往华盛顿与美国就给予法国远征军和印度支那联邦成员国经济和军事援助问题进行谈判。
    法美会谈公报透露出的情况之一是法国政府同意美国援助将直接交给印度支那联邦成员国，这意味着美帝国主义者愈来愈加紧干涉越南南部、老挝和柬埔寨。
    在谈到这次会谈时，这位法国部长说，法国政府和美国政府在印度支那问题上的见解是完全一致的。
    这位法国部长又说：“我们在会谈中认识到，我们正在越南进行同一的争取自由的斗争，应当进行充分的配合和充分的合作。”
    这是在日内瓦会议以前的时期中的惯常的语调。
    对于美国干涉者来说，“争取自由的斗争”意味着继续和扩大印度支那战争。在日内瓦会议之后，从上述事实看来，“争取自由的斗争”，对美帝国主义者来说，意味着进行努力以阻挠日内瓦协定的履行。
    华盛顿会谈不仅证明美国决心遵循侵略印度支那各国人民的政策，并且还证明，在遵循这个否定日内瓦协定的政策时，美国在法国统治集团中找到
  一些殷勤的合作者。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府强烈反对美国
  一直在不断奉行的这种针对越南人民的基本权利的侵略政策。这种政策的目的过去是要延长和扩大印度支那战争。在目前，它的目的是要阻碍日内瓦协定的实施，阻挠印度支那的稳定和持久的和平的建立，在这个半岛制造一种不稳定的局势，严重威胁印度支那各国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整，威胁它们的安全和和平。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府决心忠实地严格执行日内瓦协议。同时，他们坚决地为使所有有关方面忠实地严格执行这些协议而奋斗，并坚决反对一切违反日内瓦协议的行为。
    虽然法国统治集团某些分子趋向于奉行一种违反日内瓦协议的文字和精神和更加靠拢华盛顿的政策，但是越南民主共和国政府和越南人民决定对法国采取协商政策，这种政策已经在日内瓦会议上得到良好的结果。他们希望在平等和互利的基础上同法国建立经济和文化关系，并且愿意根据范文同先生和孟戴斯—弗朗斯先生在日内瓦交换的信件中所提到的各项原则来解决法国在越南的利益的问题。我们坚信法国人民和在法国的所有爱好和平的人们将坚决支持这种政策。
    在争取正确执行日内瓦协议，争取在承认印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上建立印度支那的稳定而持久的和平，以及和法国建立信任和友好关系的斗争中、越南民主共和国政府和越南人民知道他们是得到法国人民，东南亚各国人民和政府以及全世界的所有爱好和平的国家的人民和政府的支持的。
