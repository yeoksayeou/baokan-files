Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 22nd: The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam answered questions raised by a reporter from the Vietnam News Agency on October 22, 1954. The full text is as follows:

Question 1: What is your view on the Manila Treaty and the inclusion of Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into the treaty's area of application? What is your view on France's participation in this treaty?

Answer: Before and during the Geneva Conference, American interventionists attempted to establish an aggressive military bloc in Southeast Asia with the aim of obstructing the conference from reaching an agreement and prolonging and expanding the Indochina War according to their instructions. However, their attempts failed. The Geneva Conference has achieved agreements aimed at restoring peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of Indochina. Since American interventionists failed to sabotage the signing of these agreements, they are now trying to hinder the implementation of the agreed terms, create conditions for further American intervention in Southeast Asia, and turn the countries in this region into American military bases and colonies. This is the political implication of the Manila Conference and the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty.

As everyone knows, it was the United States that prepared to convene the Manila Conference and draft the treaty, and Southeast Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon not only refused to join the treaty but also condemned its aggressive intentions.

Article 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference stipulates that the contracting parties of Vietnam "shall ensure that the areas assigned to them shall not participate in any military alliances and shall not be used to resume hostilities or serve an aggressive policy."

The governments of Cambodia and Laos have also issued similar statements.

However, the Manila Treaty, especially the protocol attached to the treaty, unilaterally violates the Geneva agreements by including Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty's area of implementation.

This is a blatant violation of the Geneva agreements, infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and threatening the security and peace of the people of Southeast Asia.

Therefore, the Soviet Foreign Ministry has correctly pointed out in its statement on September 14, 1954, that including these clauses (that is, Articles 4 and 8 of the Manila Treaty and the attached protocol) in the treaty clearly demonstrates their obvious intention to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements on Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, said in his report to the National People's Congress of China on September 23, 1954, that the inclusion of Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam into the "protected" area of the Southeast Asia group is a conspiracy to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements on Indochina.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in the Indian Parliament on September 29, 1954, that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has turned a peaceful region into a region where war may occur.

However, Mr. Guy La Chambre, Minister of the French Federal Member States Relationship Department, the French representative attending the Manila Conference, and the signatory of the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty, said: "It (France - editor's note) has every reason to be satisfied with the signing of the protocol on the member states of the Indochina Federation."

"According to this protocol, these countries and their territories, although not yet members of the new organization, have the right to enjoy the provisions in Articles 3 and 4 of the treaty. This means that these countries can receive the economic and technical assistance stipulated in this treaty, and it also means that the guarantees provided by this treaty in the event of aggression will apply to the entire territory of these countries."

The Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina do not agree with these words, which are inconsistent with the obligations undertaken by the French government in Geneva.

Question 2: How should we understand General Paul Ely's statement to the French press on August 30, 1954: "The ceasefire has not changed the purpose of France's policy in Indochina"?

Answer: Before the Geneva Conference, the purpose of France's policy in Indochina was to implement colonial reconquest under the increasing intervention of American imperialists. This policy was subordinate to Washington's desire to prolong and expand the Indochina War. However, this policy was defeated in the face of the victorious resistance war of the people of Indochina. The Geneva Conference was convened, and during the conference, France implemented a new policy that contributed to the success of the Geneva negotiations. The French government signed agreements to cease hostilities in the three countries of Indochina. It also promised to respect the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of these countries. However, General Paul Ely said in his speech: "The ceasefire has not changed the purpose of France's policy in Indochina," and he also said: "France's assistance to South Vietnam should be coordinated with American assistance," and there will also be military assistance.

The policy mentioned by General Paul Ely is inconsistent with the policy pursued by the French government at the Geneva Conference and the spirit of the agreements signed by the French government. This policy tends to follow the Washington line as in the period before the Geneva Conference.

Question 3: What is the attitude of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people towards the French-American talks held in Washington at the end of September 1954?

Answer: After the signing of the Manila Treaty, Mr. Guy La Chambre and General Paul Ely went to Washington to negotiate with the United States on the issue of providing economic and military assistance to the French Expeditionary Force and the member states of the Indochina Federation.

One of the things revealed in the French-American talks communique is that the French government agreed that American aid would be directly given to the member states of the Indochina Federation, which means that American imperialists are increasingly intensifying their intervention in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

When talking about this meeting, the French minister said that the French government and the American government had completely consistent views on the Indochina issue.

The French minister also said: "We recognized in the talks that we are fighting the same struggle for freedom in Vietnam and that full coordination and full cooperation should be carried out."

This is the usual tone in the period before the Geneva Conference.

For American interventionists, the "struggle for freedom" means continuing and expanding the Indochina War. After the Geneva Conference, judging from the above facts, the "struggle for freedom" means, for American imperialists, making efforts to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements.

The Washington talks not only proved that the United States is determined to follow a policy of aggression against the people of Indochina, but also proved that in following this policy that denies the Geneva agreements, the United States has found some diligent collaborators among the French ruling groups.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly oppose this aggressive policy against the basic rights of the Vietnamese people that the United States has been constantly pursuing. The purpose of this policy in the past was to prolong and expand the Indochina War. At present, its purpose is to obstruct the implementation of the Geneva agreements, hinder the establishment of stable and lasting peace in Indochina, create an unstable situation in this peninsula, seriously threaten the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the countries of Indochina, and threaten their security and peace.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are determined to faithfully and strictly implement the Geneva agreements. At the same time, they are resolutely fighting to ensure that all parties concerned faithfully and strictly implement these agreements, and resolutely oppose all acts that violate the Geneva agreements.

Although some members of the French ruling group tend to pursue a policy that violates the letter and spirit of the Geneva agreements and is closer to Washington, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people have decided to adopt a policy of consultation towards France, which has already achieved good results at the Geneva Conference. They hope to establish economic and cultural relations with France on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and are willing to resolve the issue of France's interests in Vietnam in according to the principles mentioned in the letters exchanged between Mr. Pham Van Dong and Mr. Mend√®s-France in Geneva. We firmly believe that the French people and all peace-loving people in France will firmly support this policy.

In the struggle to correctly implement the Geneva agreements, to establish stable and lasting peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the people of Indochina, and to establish trust and friendly relations with France, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people know that they are supported by the French people, the people and governments of Southeast Asian countries, and the people and governments of all peace-loving countries in the world.
