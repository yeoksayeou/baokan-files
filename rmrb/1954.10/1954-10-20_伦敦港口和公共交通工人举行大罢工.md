Xinhua News Agency, London, October 16th: Approximately 45,000 dockworkers, ship repair workers, bus and trolleybus drivers and conductors in London are on strike as of October 15th.

The number of striking London dockworkers and ship repair workers has now exceeded 30,000, about half of whom are striking against the wishes of their union leaders. The strike is still expanding, with the 4,500 members of the barge, raft and tugboat workers' union deciding to stop work on the 17th.

In support of the London dockworkers, 2,000 dockworkers in Southampton went on strike for one day on the 13th. On the same day, 1,000 dockworkers in Glasgow also went on strike.

The British authorities' attempt to divert ships in London to other British and foreign ports to unload cargo has also failed. Dockworkers in Sunderland, northeast England, announced on the 13th that they would not work on ships from London. Dockworkers in Middlesbrough and Antwerp, Belgium, also refused to unload ships from London.

The strike by London bus and trolleybus drivers and conductors, demanding improved working conditions, began on the 13th. By the 15th, more than 15,000 people had joined the strike, accounting for more than one-third of London's bus and trolleybus drivers and conductors. More than half of London's buses and trolleybuses have stopped running.

The growing strike in London is causing concern to the Conservative government. On the 15th, Churchill convened two cabinet meetings within 24 hours to discuss ways to deal with the strike. British Labour Minister Monckton urged the striking dockworkers to return to work, but the British National Dock Labourers' Union rejected Monckton's request.

Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, issued a statement on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain regarding the London strike. The statement said: The excellent struggle now being waged by the dockworkers, ship repair workers and transport workers in London is an example that inspires all working people. The strikers' struggle is not only for their own interests, but also for the interests of the entire working class. The strikers deserve the full support of the entire working class, but the Trades Union Congress General Council remains silent. The statement emphasized: This large-scale strike is an eruption of long-accumulated resentment, because they feel that their living conditions have become unbearable. This strike will have a huge impact on the future development of the workers' movement. It points the way for railway workers, machine manufacturing workers, shipbuilders and miners. The strike shows that if you want to increase wages, you should fight for it. The London strike has laid a solid foundation for the unity of the workers' movement.

Xinhua News Agency, London, October 19th: As of the 18th, the number of striking workers in Britain had rapidly increased to more than 75,000.

The London dockworkers' strike, which has lasted for two weeks, has expanded, with 4,500 tugboat and barge workers joining the strike on the 17th. At the same time, about 7,000 dockworkers in Liverpool and Birkenhead, disregarding the obstruction of the powerful right-wing union leader Deakin, announced a strike on the 18th to support the London dockworkers' struggle. Now, in London, the largest port handling about one-third of Britain's foreign trade, port activity has completely stopped; in Liverpool, Britain's second-largest port, and in Birkenhead, the loading and unloading work of about 60 ships has also been completely or partially stopped.

Some large shipping companies tried to escape the impact of the British dockworkers' strike by diverting ships to ports such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Antwerp in Belgium to unload cargo, but they were unsuccessful. Dutch and Belgian dockworkers, in solidarity with British dockworkers, refused to work on these ships.

The London ship repair workers' strike has lasted for more than 20 days. The London public transport workers' strike is also spreading. Currently, 21,000 bus and trolleybus drivers and conductors have joined the strike. On the 17th, several thousand people participated in a mass meeting held by public transport workers in Trafalgar Square, and donated large sums of money to support the striking workers. After the meeting, the striking workers also marched in procession through the streets of London.

12,000 British installation workers also announced that they had begun a simultaneous strike on many construction sites, demanding wage increases.

After holding several cabinet meetings, the Churchill government has established a court of inquiry to "investigate" the causes of the strike. According to Reuters, the government has drafted a plan to deploy 15,000 soldiers to undermine the London dockworkers' strike.

    伦敦港口和公共交通工人举行大罢工
     【新华社十六日讯】伦敦消息：十月十五日：伦敦约有四万五千码头工人、船舶修理工人、公共汽车和无轨电车的司机和售票员在罢工。
    现在，罢工的伦敦码头工人和船舶修理工人已经超过了三万人，其中约有半数是不顾他们工会领袖的意志而罢工的。罢工还在扩大，驳船筏船拖船工人工会的四千五百个会员已经决定在十七日停止工作。
    为了声援伦敦码头工人，南安普敦有二千个码头工人在十三日罢工一天。同日，格拉斯哥的一千个码头工人也举行了罢工。
    英国当局想把在伦敦的船只开到英国其他港口和外国港口去卸货的企图也失败了。英国东北部桑德兰的码头工人在十三日宣布，他们将不为来自伦敦的船工作。密德尔斯布罗和比利时安特卫普的码头工人也拒绝为从伦敦来的船只卸货。
    伦敦公共汽车和无轨电车的司机和售票员为了要求改善劳动条件而举行的罢工是在十三日开始的。到十五日，参加罢工的已经有一万五千多人，占伦敦公共汽车和无轨电车的司机和售票员三分之
  一以上。伦敦的公共汽车和无轨电车已有的半数以上停止行驶。
    伦敦日益扩大的罢工使得保守党政府感到不安。十五日，邱吉尔在二十四小时内召集了两次内阁会议，来商讨对付罢工的方法。英国劳工大臣蒙克顿劝罢工的码头工人复工，但是英国全国码头工人联合会拒绝了蒙克顿的要求。
    英国共产党总书记波立特代表英国共产党执行委员会，就伦敦的罢工发表声明。声明说：伦敦码头工人、船舶修理工人和交通工人现在所进行的出色的斗争，是鼓舞所有劳动人民的榜样。罢工者的斗争不仅是为了自己的利益，而且也是为了全体工人阶级的利益。罢工者理应获得整个工人阶级的全力支持，但是英国职工大会最高委员会却默不作声。声明强调：这次大规模的罢工是人们长期积忿的爆发，因为他们感觉到他们的生活条件已经变得难以忍受了。这次罢工对工人运动将来的发展会有巨大的影响。它向铁路工人、机器制造工人、造船工人和矿工们指出了道路。罢工表明：如果想提高工资，就应当为此而斗争。伦敦的罢工为工人运动的团结打下了巩固的基础。
      【新华社十九日讯】伦敦消息：到十八日为止，英国罢工工人已经迅速增加到七万五千人以上。
    已经坚持了两个星期的伦敦码头工人的罢工已经扩大，十七日，有四千五百名拖船、驳船工人参加了罢工。同时，利物浦和柏肯黑德的码头工人约七千人也不顾有势力的右翼工会领袖狄金的阻挠，在十八日宣布罢工，来支援伦敦码头工人的斗争。现在，在伦敦，这个起卸约达三分之一的英国对外贸易货物的第一大港，港口活动已经完全停顿；在英国第二大港利物浦以及在柏肯黑德，也有约六十艘船的装卸工作完全停顿或部分停顿。
    一些大航运公司想逃避英国码头工人罢工的影响而把船只开到荷兰的阿姆斯特丹、鹿特丹和比利时的安特卫普等港口去卸货，但是没有成功。和英国码头工人团结一致的荷兰和比利时的码头工人拒绝为这些船只工作。
    伦敦船舶修理工人的罢工已经坚持了二十多天。伦敦公共交通工人的罢工也在蔓延。现在，参加罢工的已经有公共汽车和无轨电车的司机和售票员二万一千人。十七日，有好几千人参加了公共交通工人在特拉法加广场举行的群众大会，并且捐助了大笔款项来支援罢工工人。会后，罢工工人还在伦敦大街上列队游行。
    一万二千个英国安装工人也宣布，他们开始在许多工地上同时罢工，要求增加工资。
    邱吉尔政府在举行了多次内阁会议后，已经成立了一个调查法庭，来“调查”罢工原因。据路透社透露，政府已经拟好了计划，打算调一万五千个士兵来破坏伦敦港口工人的罢工。
