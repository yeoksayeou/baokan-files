As a delegate to the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Feng Xuefeng reports:

    The historic victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the achievements of the state in politics, economy, culture, military affairs, etc., since the founding of the People's Republic of China, have promoted our literature to enter a new stage of development. The readership of literary works has expanded a thousand-fold compared to before liberation. The broad masses of people are paying attention to literature with increasing enthusiasm, and their demands and expectations for writers are becoming more and more urgent. The Party and the government are very concerned about the creative cause of literature and art, and have not only pointed out the tasks of struggle and the direction of creation for literary and art workers, but also provided spiritual and material assistance to the work of writers and artists as much as possible. Most importantly, the comprehensive and great changes in actual life have infinitely expanded the creative source of writers. Under the general task of building a socialist society, the class struggle and the conflict between the new and the old in our society are unfolding on an unprecedentedly broad and profound scale, and the creative enthusiasm of the working class and all working people is also rising day by day. This not only gives our literature new historical tasks, but also stimulates the high creative enthusiasm of writers.

    Although the development of our literature is still far behind the development of many other aspects of our country, it has made significant progress in itself. In the first two or three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, our creative circles appeared to be inactive. Some works published at that time could only reflect the new era superficially. Although they described new phenomena and new struggles in life, they could not convey the content and spirit of the new struggles more deeply. In some works that praised the victory of the people or praised the new era at that time, abstract concepts, empty ideas, and outdated tunes often exceeded the fresh and authentic feelings for life. Most writers, faced with the new and great reality, were unable to grasp it more comprehensively and profoundly for a while.

    Since then, most writers have successively participated in the great movements such as land reform, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. Some writers have been working in rural areas or factories for certain practical tasks for the past three or four years. On the other hand, starting from the criticism of the erroneous film "The Life of Wu Xun" in 1951 until recently, we have conducted several large-scale study movements in which writers across the country participated, focusing on opposing bourgeois ideology, on the domestic and international political situation, on the general task and general line of national construction, and on the principle of socialist realism in creation. The actual results have proven that writers going deep into the people and participating in the struggle of the masses – as Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly advised us – is the fundamental way to overcome the separation between literature and reality. At the same time, studying politics, studying the general task and general line of national construction, opposing bourgeois ideological influences, and correctly understanding the principles of socialist realism in creation are also most necessary. In the past two years, our writers' ability to grasp reality has obviously been growing. Generally speaking, the works published in these two years are gradually showing new features and a new spirit.

    Some of our achievements in literary creation in the past five years have come from our efforts to overcome the separation from reality. Because our efforts are still far from enough, our achievements are not satisfactory. But because we are working hard to approach and delve into actual life, some of the achievements we have made will not only explain the past work, but also have important significance for the future development of our literature. Our literature will gradually grow stronger on fertile ground due to the correct efforts of the writers. Therefore, if we evaluate some of our achievements in the past five years from the direction of our writers' efforts, it will be more in line with the actual situation of our literary development.

    The relationship between modern Chinese literature and peasants has always been very close. For example, some of the brilliant artistic images of the oppressed working people created by Lu Xun, the founder of modern Chinese literature, are mainly peasants. After the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, which was of historical significance to our literature and art, until the national liberation, due to the great advancement of the combination of our writers and the revolutionary struggle of the people, we produced some works with a new spirit, most of which also describe the peasant masses struggling for their own liberation under the leadership of the Party. For example, Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," Zhao Shuli's novellas and short stories, Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane," He Jingzhi and Ding Yi's "The White-Haired Girl," Li Ji's "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," Ouyang Shan's "Gao Qian Da," Liu Qing's "The Story of Seedlings," and so on. In terms of realist achievements, "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" is a representative work among these works.

    The land reform that began after the liberation of the mainland and the agricultural production cooperative movement that began after the completion of the land reform are two great movements in the past five years that reflect the class struggle and the struggle between the new and the old in rural areas. In the past five years, we have continued to produce some works depicting the peasant masses in the land reform struggle; these works are not very outstanding, but as a connection between our creation and actual life after liberation, as the first step for the authors of these works to approach the new reality, they are still meaningful. In the past two years, the peasant masses who are entering the great struggle of socialist transformation have gradually begun to appear in our works. For example, some short stories by Kang Zhuo, Luo Binji, Ma Feng, Li Zhun, Ji Xuepei and others, and An Bo's play "The Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," are attempts at this new theme. Although these works have not achieved much, the struggle and new spirit of the peasant masses in the initial stage of socialist transformation have been reflected to some extent. Several novellas and novels depicting this aspect of life will also be completed soon.

    In the past five years, some works depicting the struggle of the peasant masses during the Liberation War and the Anti-Japanese War have also been produced. Among them, Liu Qing's novel "The Bronze Walls and Iron Bastions" is a relatively excellent one. It depicts the story of the people in the old base areas supporting the war during the Liberation War, and has achieved success in realism. Chen Dengke's novella "Huo Rentang" and "Children on the Huai River," Sun Li's "The Beginning of the Storm," and others are also works with relatively substantial content. We have also produced some works reflecting the struggle between the new and the old in rural areas after liberation, as reflected in the reform of the marriage system and changes in family life, such as some short stories by Ma Feng, Qin Zhaoyang, Shi Guo, Wang Anyou, and others, and Sun Yu's one-act play "Women Representative," and so on.

    Secondly, among the works in the past five years, works depicting the combat history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Anti-Japanese War and the domestic revolutionary war accounted for a large proportion. The authors of these works participated in the battles they described in various periods and on various battlefields; their feelings in the battles and the revolutionary heroism of the soldiers and the ordinary people who participated in the battles could not but inspire their creative desire. Moreover, the people's revolutionary war is connected with all aspects of our actual life, and the spirit of revolutionary heroism displayed by the Chinese people in the struggle to liberate themselves is also the most inspiring and educational. Among these works, the more excellent ones are Liu Baiyu's novella "Firelight in Front," the play "Growing Up in Battle" co-authored by Hu Peng and Hu Ke and others, Ma Jia's novella "The Flower That Never Fades," Li Erzhong's novella "Leadership," Xu Guangyao's novella "Prairie Fire," Chen Qitong's play "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains," Xie Xuechou's novella "Regimental Commander," and Du Pengcheng's novel "Defend Yan'an." "Defend Yan'an" is not only a representative work of our works depicting the people's revolutionary war, but also an excellent work that can represent the achievements of realism we have achieved in the past five years. From its fundamental spirit to its original artistic depiction, it is a work with the spirit of an epic of heroes.

    In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, which began in 1950, the people of the whole country united and fought for the security of the motherland and world peace, and the spirit of patriotism and internationalism of our people was brought to a very high level. The great actions of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the heroic Korean People's Army in Korea especially encouraged the fighting spirit of our people to build a new China and oppose imperialist aggression. Under this encouragement, many of our writers went to the front lines in Korea one after another, and they wrote many artistic news reports and essays with encouraging power (novelists Liu Baiyu, Ba Jin, Yang Shuo, Lu Ling, Huang Guliu, Bai Lang, Han Zi, poets Wei Wei, Tian Jian, playwrights Song Zhi's, Huang Gang, etc., are all authors of such reports and essays). These works have an important position in our literary achievements in the past five years. At the same time, we have also produced some novels and plays depicting the struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, among which the more noteworthy ones are Yang Shuo's novella "Three Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains," Lu Zhuguo's "Shangganling," Hai Mo's "Breaking Through the Imjin River," and so on; short stories include Li Jia's "By the Imjin River," Han Feng's "Shooter," Qing Ni's "Toad River Ice Wave," Ba Jin's "Comrade Huang Wenyuan," and other writers' works; plays include Huang Ti's "Steel Transportation Soldier," Hu Ke's "The Front Line Moves South," and so on. There are also some good works among the poems praising the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people, and the struggle to defend peace.

    The most important aspect of our current actual life—the struggle and creation of the great working class for socialist industrialization—is a completely new field for our literature. In the past five years, there have been relatively few works reflecting the struggle and creation of the working masses, among which the more noteworthy ones are the play "In Front of New Things" co-authored by Du Yin and others, Bai Lang's novella "For a Happy Tomorrow," the play "Forty Years of Wishes" co-authored by Li Qingsheng and others, Xia Yan's play "Test," Lei Jia's novel "Spring Arrives at the Yalu River," and so on. It is most unsatisfactory that the most important aspect of our actual life is only so weakly reflected in our literature, and therefore it is also a major aspect that we must overcome our backwardness with the greatest effort. Now, more and more writers are participating in industrial construction work and approaching the working masses, and we hope that soon there will be more works depicting the creation and struggle of the working masses.

    In the past five years, some promising new writers have emerged, and some of the works cited above are from the hands of new writers. At the same time, some old writers have also published new works in the past five years, such as Ba Jin publishing the short stories and news reports about the Chinese People's Volunteers mentioned above, Lao She publishing the play "Dragon Beard Ditch," Cao Yu recently publishing the play "Bright Sky," and Ye Shengtao recently publishing short stories after publishing some essays. These works all have a new spirit, which is enough to show their efforts to approach actual life and their ideological development.

    It is particularly worth mentioning that many ethnic minorities in our country have begun to have creative activities in literature and art since liberation, and new writers have begun to emerge—such as Malaqinfu (author of short stories "People of the Horqin Grassland," etc.), Peng Sike (author of the novella "Golden Xing'an Mountains"), etc. Before liberation, many ethnic minorities in our country lived a very backward cultural life under the oppression and discrimination of the reactionary rule, and some did not even have their own writing; after liberation, with the improvement of material life and the improvement of political status, cultural and artistic activities also began to develop unprecedentedly. Some ethnic groups without writing have created their own writing with the help of the government. In literature, now they are engaged in recording and sorting out the original oral literature on the one hand, and engaging in new creation on the other hand.

    In the field of children's literature, the Chinese Writers Association has helped the National Committee for the Defense of Children of the Chinese People to conduct an award evaluation for children's literary and artistic creation in the past four years, and awarded some relatively excellent works. But in general, our achievements in the past five years are very small. Writers are only now beginning to pay attention to this work.

    It is very clear that our achievements are far from what our people hope for. For the growth of our literature, the most fundamental thing is to continue to strengthen the connection between our writers and actual life. This problem has not only existed for a long time in the past, but will also exist for a long time in the future. It can be said that all our writers still experience and understand too little about the current deep and complex actual life in our country. Only by continuing to work hard to go deep into the people, participate in various aspects of socialist construction, and be familiar with all aspects of our society, and strengthen our fighting spirit, can we improve our ability to grasp reality and improve the creativity of our literature. At the same time, the cultural accomplishment and artistic expression ability of most of our writers are also very insufficient. Therefore, we must try our best to improve our cultural and ideological cultivation, and at the same time learn from Chinese and foreign classical literature, especially from Soviet literature, which is also a fundamental problem.

    The non-proletarian ideological consciousness that has not been completely overcome in our writers is undoubtedly one of the obstacles affecting the healthy development of our literature. Because non-proletarian ideology, mainly bourgeois ideology, not only hinders writers from delving into actual life, but also hinders them from correctly grasping reality; in this way, it also hinders the improvement of the revolutionary fighting spirit of our literature, so that we cannot serve the struggle of socialist construction with the fighting spirit of literature. At present, bourgeois ideology is mainly manifested in the tendency to deviate from politics and the ideological viewpoints of individualism. Some works lack a fighting spirit, fail to inspire readers to recognize the deep and sharp class struggle and the struggle between the new and the old in life, and at the same time, readers cannot feel the author's political enthusiasm or fighting intentions. Some writers have failed to change their original individualistic views on life, and therefore cannot have a deep and essential understanding of the new spirit and face of the people—the new and most essential life phenomenon that is developing towards collectivism and combining personal interests with social interests. There is no doubt that opposing bourgeois ideological tendencies is one of the important struggles that we cannot relax. In our literary and art circles, since the criticism of the error of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" in 1951, the criticism and struggle against bourgeois ideological tendencies has been quite intense; but the bourgeois ideological tendencies in literary and art circles are not only the remnants of the old ideas of literary and art workers themselves, but also the manifestation of the erosion of our country by the still existing bourgeoisie and its ideology at home and abroad, which requires us to carry out a long-term ideological struggle.

    Various kinds of dogmatic errors are also a serious problem for us, because they also hinder the healthy development of our literature and the improvement of the fighting spirit. No matter what kind of dogmatism, it hinders writers from having a deep and creative understanding of life; moreover, no matter what kind of dogmatism, it will make writers lose the ability to generalize the complex, concrete and vivid content of actual life into their works. Therefore, dogmatic works always have very little, or even no, appeal and educational significance. The occurrence of various dogmatic tendencies is mainly due to the writers' isolation from actual life, and also due to the writers' being bound by certain concepts that are divorced from actual content or certain narrow experiences. Therefore, we feel that going deep into actual life and improving the ability of thought in the experience of actual life is the fundamental way to overcome dogmatic errors.

    The direction of our work in the past five years has been correct, in line with the instructions of the Party and the government and the requirements of the people; the problem now and in the future is that we must redouble our efforts to overcome the existing backwardness, so that our literature can play a greater role in the great socialist construction of our country.

    五年来我国文学创作的发展方向
    全国人民代表大会代表
    中国作家协会副主席  冯雪峰
    我国人民革命的历史性胜利和中华人民共和国成立以来国家在政治、经济、文化、军事等方面的成就，推动了我们的文学进入新的发展阶段。文学作品的读者，和解放前比较，现在是千百倍地扩大了。广大人民以日益增长的热忱注意着文学，对作家的要求和期待一天比一天地迫切。党和政府很关心文学和艺术的创造事业，既向文学和艺术工作者指出了战斗的任务和创造的方向，又尽可能地给作家和艺术家的工作以精神上和物质上的帮助。最重要的，是实际生活的全面的伟大变革，使作家们的创造源泉无限地扩大了。在建设社会主义社会的总的任务之下，我们社会的阶级斗争和新与旧的矛盾冲突正在空前广阔地、深刻地展开着，而工人阶级和一切劳动人民的创造热潮也日益高涨起来。这不仅给我们文学以新的历史任务，而且激发了作家们的高度创造热情。
    我们文学的发展虽然直到今天还很落后于我们国家其他许多方面的发展，但就其本身说，已经有了显著的进步。在中华人民共和国成立后的最初两三年中，我们的创作界是显得不活跃的。当时发表的某些作品，对于新时代还只能作浮光掠影的反映。它们虽然描写了生活的新的现象和新的斗争，但不能比较深刻地传达出新的斗争的内容和精神。在当时有些歌颂人民的胜利或歌颂新的时代的作品，其中抽象的概念、空洞的思想和陈旧的调子，往往超过了对于生活的新鲜而真实的感受。大多数作家面对着新的伟大的现实，一时还不能对它有比较全面和比较深刻的掌握。
    从那时候起，大多数作家都陆续参加了土地改革、抗美援朝、以及“三反”“五反”等伟大运动。有些作家，在这三四年中一直在农村或工厂中担任了一定的实际工作。另一方面从一九五一年批判电影“武训传”的错误开始，一直到最近，我们曾经进行了几次全国作家都参加的关于反对资产阶级思想、关于国内和国际的政治形势、关于国家建设的总任务和总路线以及关于社会主义的现实主义创作原则等的大规模的学习运动。实际的成果已经可以证明：作家深入人民群众中去并参加群众的斗争，——像毛泽东同志曾经许多次劝告过我们的——是克服文学和现实的隔离的根本办法。同时，研究政治，研究国家建设的总任务和总路线，反对资产阶级的思想影响，正确地了解社会主义的现实主义创作原则，也都是最必要的。最近两年来，我们作家掌握现实的能力显然在增长着。这两年中发表的作品，大概地说来，正在逐渐地显示出新的面貌和新的精神。
    五年中我们在文学创造上的一些成就，都是从我们克服和现实的隔离的努力中得来的。由于我们的这种努力还很不够，我们的成就也就不能令人满意。但因为我们努力在接近和深入实际生活，所以我们已取得的一些成就将不仅只说明过去的工作，而且对于今后我们文学的发展也将有重要的意义。我们的文学将会由作家们的这种正确的努力而逐渐地在肥沃的土地上壮大起来。因此，如果从我们作家努力的方向上来评价我们在这五年中的一些成就，那就更切合我们文学发展的实际情况。
    现代中国文学和农民的关系向来是很密切的，例如现代中国文学的开山祖鲁迅所创造的一些被压迫劳动人民的辉煌的艺术形象，其中主要的就是农民。在一九四二年对于我们文学和艺术有历史意义的延安文艺座谈会之后，到全国解放时之间，由于我们作家和人民群众的革命斗争的结合大大地推进了一步，我们产生了一些具有新的精神的作品，而其中大多数所描写的也都是在党领导下为自身解放而斗争的农民群众。例如丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”、赵树理的中篇和短篇小说、周立波的“暴风骤雨”、贺敬之和丁毅的“白毛女”、李季的“王贵与李香香”、欧阳山的“高乾大”、柳青的“种谷记”等等。而在现实主义的成就上，“太阳照在桑乾河上”是这些作品中的代表作。
      全国大陆解放后所开始的土地改革以及土地改革完成后所开始的农业生产合作化运动，是这五年中反映了农村中阶级斗争和新与旧斗争的两个伟大运动。在这五年中，我们继续产生了一些描写在土地改革斗争中的农民群众的作品；这些作品都不怎样出色，但当作在解放后我们的创作和实际生活的一种联系来看，当作这些作品的作者们走近新的现实的第一步来看，仍然都是有意义的。最近两年来，正在进入社会主义改造的伟大斗争中的农民群众，已经开始在我们的作品中逐渐地出现。例如康濯、骆宾基、马烽、李准、吉学沛等人的一些短篇小说，安波的剧本“春风吹到诺敏河”等，是对于这种新的主题的尝试。这些作品虽然成就还不大，但农民群众在社会主义改造的最初阶段中的斗争和新的精神已经得到一些反映。描写这一方面生活的，还有几部中篇和长篇小说不久即可以脱稿。
    在这五年中，还产生了一些描写农民群众在解放战争时期和抗日战争时期的斗争的作品，其中如柳青的长篇小说“铜墙铁壁”，是较为优秀的一部，它描写在解放战争时期老根据地人民支援战争的故事，在现实主义上是有成就的。陈登科的中篇小说“活人塘”和“淮河边上的儿女”、孙犁的“风云初记”等，也是有比较充实的内容的作品。我们也产生了一些反映农村中在解放后从婚姻制度的改革和家庭生活的变化上所表现出来的新与旧的斗争的作品，如马烽、秦兆阳、石果、王安友等人的一些短篇小说，孙芋的独幕剧“妇女代表”等等。
    其次，在这五年的作品中，描写中国人民解放军在抗日战争和国内革命战争中的战斗历史的作品占了很大的比重。这些作品的作者们都曾经在各时期和各战场参加过他们所描写的战斗；他们在战斗中的感受以及战士们和参加战斗的普通人民群众的革命英雄主义的精神，就不能不激发着他们的创作欲。而且人民革命战争联系着我国的实际生活的各方面，同时中国人民在解放自己的斗争中所发扬的革命英雄主义的精神也最具有鼓舞和教育的力量。这些作品中较为优秀的有刘白羽的中篇小说“火光在前”、胡朋和胡可等人合作的剧本“在战斗里成长”、马加的中篇小说“开不败的花朵”、李尔重的中篇小说“领导”、徐光耀的中篇小说“平原烈火”、陈其通的剧本“万水千山”、谢雪畴的中篇小说“团指挥员”、杜鹏程的长篇小说“保卫延安”等。“保卫延安”不仅是我们描写人民革命战争的作品的代表作，而且是可以代表我们这五年中所达到的现实主义的成就的一部出色的作品。从它的根本精神上说，也从它的有独创性的艺术描写上说，是一部具有英雄史诗的精神的作品。
    在一九五○年开始的抗美援朝斗争中，全国人民团结一致为祖国安全和世界和平而奋斗，我国人民的爱国主义和国际主义的精神都发扬到非常的高度。在朝鲜和英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民志愿军的伟大行动，尤其鼓舞着我国人民为建设新中国和反对帝国主义侵略的战斗精神。就在这种鼓舞之下，我们有许多作家曾先后到了朝鲜前线，他们先后写了许多具有鼓舞力量的艺术性的通讯报道和散文（小说家刘白羽、巴金、杨朔、路翎、黄谷柳、白朗、菡子、诗人魏巍、田间，剧作家宋之的、黄钢，等等，都是这种报道和散文的作者）。这些作品在我们这五年中的文学成绩上是有重要地位的。同时我们也产生了一些描写中国人民志愿军的斗争以及朝中人民团结友爱的小说和剧本，其中较可注意的，如中篇小说有杨朔的“三千里江山”、陆柱国的“上甘岭”、海默的“突破临津江”等；短篇小说有里加的“临津江边”、寒风的“射手”、晴霓的“蟾江冰波”、巴金的“黄文元同志”以及其他作家的作品；剧本有黄悌的“钢铁运输兵”、胡可的“战线南移”等。歌颂中国人民志愿军和歌颂朝鲜人民以及歌颂保卫和平的斗争的诗歌中，也有一些较好的作品。
    我国目前实际生活的最重要的方面——伟大工人阶级为着社会主义工业化的斗争和创造，对于我们文学是一个完全新的领域。在这五年中，反映工人群众的斗争和创造的作品是比较的少，其中较可注意的有杜印等合作的剧本“在新事物的面前”、白朗的中篇小说“为了幸福的明天”、李庆升等合作的剧本“四十年的愿望”、夏衍的剧本“考验”、雷加的长篇小说“春天到了鸭绿江”等。我国实际生活的最重要的方面在我们文学上还只有这么单薄的反映，这是我们最不能满意的，因此也是我们要以最大的努力来克服我们的落后的一个主要的方面。现在参加工业建设工作和接近工人群众的作家已经逐渐在多起来，我们希望不久之后描写工人群众的创造和斗争的作品也会多起来。
    在这五年中，我们出现了一些有造就前途的新作家，在上文所举例的许多作品中有些就是出于新作家之手。同时一些老作家，在这五年中也都有新的作品发表，例如巴金发表了上文已经提到过的关于中国人民志愿军的短篇小说和通讯报道，老舍发表了剧本“龙须沟”等，曹禺最近发表了剧本“明朗的天”，叶圣陶在发表了一些散文之后最近也有短篇小说发表。这些作品都具有新的精神，足以说明他们接近实际生活的努力和他们思想上的发展。
    特别值得提到的，是我国许多少数民族从解放后在文学艺术上已开始有创造活动，并且开始出现了新的作家——如玛拉沁夫（短篇小说“科尔沁草原的人们”等的作者）、朋斯克（中篇小说“金色兴安岭”的作者）等。在解放前，我国许多少数民族，在反动统治的压迫和歧视之下，过着文化十分落后的生活，有些还没有自己的文字；解放后，跟着物质生活的改善和政治地位的提高，文化和艺术上的活动也开始有空前的开展。没有文字的民族，有的已经在政府的帮助之下创造了自己的文字。在文学上，现在是一方面在从事原有的口头文学的记录和整理，一方面从事新的创造。
    在儿童文学方面，中国作家协会曾帮助中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会进行关于四年来儿童文艺创作的评奖工作，奖励了一些比较优秀的作品。但总的来说，我们在这五年中的成就是很小的。作家们现在才仅仅开始注意到这方面的工作。
    十分显然，我们的成就离我们人民所希望的是太远了。为了我们文学的成长，最根本的是继续加强我们作家和实际生活的联系。这个问题不仅在过去长期存在，在今后也将是长期存在的。可以说，我们全体作家对于我国当前深广而复杂的实际生活，都还体验和通晓得太少。只有继续努力深入人民群众中去，参加社会主义建设的各方面的工作和活动，熟悉我们社会的各方面，并加强我们的斗争精神，才能够提高我们掌握现实的能力，提高我们文学的创造性。同时，我们大多数作家的文化修养和艺术表现能力也是很不够的。因此，必须尽力提高我们的文化和思想修养，同时向中国和外国的古典文学学习，尤其是向苏联文学学习，这也是一个根本问题。
    我们作家身上还有未被完全克服的非无产阶级的思想意识，这无疑是影响我们文学健康发展的阻碍物之一。因为非无产阶级思想，主要是资产阶级思想，既妨碍作家深入实际生活，也妨碍他们正确地掌握现实；这样，也就妨碍我们文学的革命斗争性的提高，使我们不能以文学的战斗精神为社会主义建设的斗争服务。在现在，资产阶级思想，主要是表现在脱离政治的倾向和个人主义的思想观点上面。某些作品很缺少斗争性，不能启发读者去认识生活中的深刻尖锐的阶级斗争和新与旧的斗争，同时读者也感觉不到作者的政治热情或战斗的意向。有的作家，未能改变自己原有的个人主义的生活观点，因而对于人民群众的新的精神和面貌——正在向着集体主义发展的、要把个人的利益和社会利益结合起来的这种新的最本质的生活现象，就不能有深刻的、从本质上的认识。毫无疑问，反对资产阶级思想倾向，是我们不能放松的重要斗争之一。在我们文学和艺术界，从一九五一年批判“武训传”影片的错误以来，对于资产阶级思想倾向的批判和斗争是相当剧烈的；但文艺界的资产阶级思想倾向不仅是文艺工作者自身的旧思想残余，而且也是国内外还存在的资产阶级及其思想意识对于我们的侵蚀作用的表现，这就需要我们进行长期的思想斗争。
    各种各样的公式主义的错误，在我们也是一个严重的问题，因为这也是妨碍我们文学的健康发展和斗争性的提高的。无论怎样的公式主义，都是妨碍作家对于生活的深刻的、有创见的认识的；而且，无论怎样的公式主义，都会使作家失去把实际生活的复杂、具体而生动的内容概括到作品中来的能力。因此公式主义的作品，总是感动力和教育意义都是极少，甚至完全没有的。各种公式主义倾向的发生，主要的是由于作家对于实际生活的隔膜，同时也由于作家受了某些脱离了实际内容的概念或某些偏狭的经验的束缚。因此，我们觉得，深入实际生活并在实际生活的体验中提高思想的能力，是克服公式主义错误的根本办法。
    五年来我们工作的方向是正确的，是符合党和政府的指示以及人民的要求的；现在和今后的问题，是必须加倍努力克服现在存在的落后状况，使我们的文学在我国社会主义的伟大建设中起更大的作用。
