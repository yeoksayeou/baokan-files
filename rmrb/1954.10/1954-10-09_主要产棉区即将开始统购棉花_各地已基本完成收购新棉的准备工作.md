Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Major cotton producing areas, including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi provinces, are about to begin the state's planned cotton procurement work. Preparations for new cotton purchases have now been basically completed in various regions.

Since the beginning of September, new cotton has been successively entering the market in some areas of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi provinces where new cotton is harvested earlier. Currently, the market supply in various regions is increasing daily. In Hebei Province, the average daily market supply of unginned cotton has reached 5 million jin.

Since the Government Administration Council issued the "Order on Implementing Planned Cotton Procurement" on September 14, relevant departments in various regions have made arrangements in light of local conditions. State-owned cotton, yarn, and cloth companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in Hebei, Shaanxi and other provinces have conducted thorough research based on the cotton growth situation throughout the province this year. Shaanxi Province has also preliminarily assessed the quantity of old cotton accumulated in rural areas over the years. Various cotton-producing provinces have increased the number of cotton purchasing stations in light of the new situation of unified state planning for cotton purchases this year. Henan Province and Handan and Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province have added more than 2,000 cotton purchasing stations and points. In order to promptly supply cotton for textile use and cotton wadding for cities and non-cotton-producing areas, various regions have made preparations for cotton inspection and processing and have established close contact with transportation departments. Jiangsu Province has trained more than 1,400 people to inspect cotton grades, more than 300 preservation workers, cotton feeding workers, and small cotton gin managers, and has signed processing contracts with various cotton ginning factories, and has also organized cotton gins in the hands of farmers. Henan Province has trained more than 1,460 people to inspect cotton grades and has organized more than 32,400 various cotton processing machines. Hebei Province has transferred a large number of scientific instruments such as electric ovens, electric moisture meters, and microscopes used to inspect cotton, as well as standard samples of unginned cotton and ginned cotton, to various cotton collection units. Some state-owned cotton, yarn, and cloth companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in special districts and counties have signed transportation guarantee agreements with local transportation departments.

   【新华社八日讯】国家在河北、河南、山东、江苏、陕西等省主要产棉区计划收购棉花的工作即将开始，现各地新棉收购准备工作已基本完成。
    从九月初开始，河北、河南、山东、江苏、陕西等省一些新棉收获较早的地区，新棉已陆续上市。目前，各地上市量都日益增加。河北省每日上市籽棉平均达五百万斤。
    自九月十四日政务院颁布“关于实行棉花计划收购的命令”后，各地有关部门都结合当地具体情况，作了布置。河北、陕西等省的国营花纱布公司和供销合作社根据今年全省棉花生长情况，作了缜密的研究。陕西省对历年积存在农村中陈棉数量也初步摸了底。各产棉省份根据今年棉花统一由国家计划收购的新情况，增设了棉花收购站。河南全省和河北省的邯郸、石家庄等地增设了二千多个棉花收购站和收购点。为了把棉花及时供应纺织用棉和城市及非产棉区的絮棉，各地对检验棉花、加工棉花的力量都已准备就绪，并和交通运输部门取得了密切联系。江苏省已训练一千四百多名检验棉花等级的人员，三百多个保全工、喂花工、小轧花车管理员，并和各轧花厂签订了加工合同，还组织农民手中的轧花车。河南省训练了检验棉花等级人员一千四百六十多人，组织了各种棉花加工车三万二千四百多部。河北省已把大批用以检验棉花的电烘箱、电感测湿器、显微镜等科学仪器和籽棉、皮棉标准样品调到各收棉单位，有些专区、县的国营花纱布公司和供销合作社和当地运输部门订立了保运协议合同。
