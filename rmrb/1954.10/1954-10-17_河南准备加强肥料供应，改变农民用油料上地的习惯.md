Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Letter from the Agricultural Department of the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry: The situation reflected by Comrade Kou Qintian in your newspaper on June 28, regarding the fact that many farmers in our province use oil crops as fertilizer, is indeed true. In some areas, attention has been paid to guiding farmers to use oil crops to extract oil, then use the oil cake to raise pigs, and then use pig manure to fertilize the land; however, the work is not done well enough, and the issue of supplying fertilizer to farmers has not been addressed. Therefore, we plan to work with cooperatives to strengthen the purchase of oil crops and the supply of fertilizer, and agricultural and forestry departments will strengthen technical guidance and publicity, gradually changing farmers' habit of using oil crops as fertilizer.

    Letter from the Henan Provincial Cooperative Union: The situation reflected by Comrade Kou Qintian is correct. In the past, in our fertilizer supply work, we did not do enough publicity and education for farmers, and the unreasonable prices of oil cake and oil crops further fueled the development of farmers' habit of using oil crops as fertilizer. In the future, we plan to improve fertilizer supply work on the one hand, and strengthen education for farmers on saving oil crops and supporting national construction, and promote the benefits of using oil cake and farm manure on the other hand. At the same time, we will study with relevant departments to solve the problem of unreasonable prices of oil cake and oil crops.

    河南准备加强肥料供应，改变农民用油料上地的习惯
    河南省人民政府农林厅农业处来信：你报六月二十八日所登寇勤田同志反映我省不少农民用油料上地的情况是确实的。这个问题，有的地区已经注意宣传指导农民利用油料榨油，再用油饼养猪，然后用猪粪上地；但是作的很不够，而且没有注意到供应农民肥料的问题。因此，我们准备与合作社研究，由他们加强油料收购和肥料供应工作，农林部门加强技术指导及宣传工作，逐步使农民改变用油料上地的习惯。
    河南省合作社联合社来信：寇勤田同志所反映的情况是正确的。过去我们在供肥工作中，对农民的宣传教育确是作得不够，加之饼肥与油料价格不合理，更加助长了农民用油料上地的习惯的发展。今后，我们准备一方面改善肥料供应工作，一方面对农民加强节约油料、支援国家建设的教育，和使用饼肥与农家肥的好处的宣传。同时和有关部门研究解决饼肥与油料价格不合理的问题。
