    Welcoming Mr. Nehru
    Chen Jiageng
    At the invitation of our government, Mr. Nehru, the distinguished Indian statesman, has come to Beijing. This is a sign of the growing friendship between the two major Asian countries.

    For a long time, the great Chinese people and the great Indian people have been fighting against foreign aggression and oppression, fighting for independence and freedom, and have sympathized and cared for each other in the struggle. After establishing new nations, the people of both countries share a common desire and have made joint efforts to safeguard world peace. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India and the joint statement issued with Prime Minister Nehru are the most prominent examples of this joint effort.

    Mr. Nehru is vigilant against the conspiracies of American aggressors to covet Asia, and is actively participating in the common cause of consolidating Asian peace. Whether it is striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, striving to end the Indochina War, establishing and expanding the Asian peace zone, or opposing the aggressive "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," we clearly see Mr. Nehru's contribution.

    The joint statements by the Prime Ministers of China and India, and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have had a wide impact in Asia and the world. It has not only strengthened the friendly relations between China and India, and China and Burma, but also pointed out a clear path for establishing collective peace in Asia and the world. We see that the people of Indonesia, Ceylon, and other Asian countries have expressed the same will and desire.

    The trend of Asian people demanding to follow the path of peace and prosperity is irresistible, and the forces of peace in Asia and the world are irresistible.

    The friendship between overseas Indian and Chinese communities is also very obvious. I remember that in 1946, when Mr. Nehru visited the Indian community in Singapore, India had not yet achieved independence, and China was under the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and I (representing the Yihe Xuan Club) jointly initiated the welcome to Mr. Nehru. The Kuomintang faction of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce did not dare to participate because Mr. Nehru was fighting for independence from Britain. I delivered a speech at the welcome party at the Yihe Xuan Club, hoping that Britain would keep its promise and not betray it, and wished India an early independence. In the open-air mass rallies held in many places in Singapore, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese and Indian communities participated each time. This proves that the three million overseas Chinese and more than seven hundred thousand Indian communities in Malaya are friendly, caring, and sympathetic to each other.

    The Indian people are diligent, brave, and peace-loving, and the Chinese people are also diligent, brave, and peace-loving. The friendship and cooperation of nearly one billion people will have an inestimable effect on consolidating peace in Asia and the world. Mr. Nehru's visit to China will undoubtedly greatly strengthen the historical friendly ties between the two countries. I firmly believe that the people of our two countries have full confidence and determination to prevent Asia from becoming a breeding ground for war and transform it into a bulwark of international peace.

    欢迎尼赫鲁先生
  　陈嘉庚
    印度卓越的政治家尼赫鲁先生应我国政府的邀请到北京来了，这是亚洲两大国友谊日益增进的标志。
    伟大的中国人民和伟大的印度人民，长久以来，都在为反抗外国的侵略与压迫而奋斗，为争取独立与自由而奋斗，并在战斗中互相同情与关心。各自建立新的国家以后，两国人民对于保卫世界和平事业，具有共同的愿望，作了共同的努力。周恩来总理访问印度，和尼赫鲁总理发表了联合声明，便是这种共同努力的最显著的例子。
    尼赫鲁先生对于美国侵略者觊觎亚洲的阴谋是警惕着的，对于巩固亚洲和平的共同事业是积极参与的。无论是争取和平解决朝鲜问题，争取停止印度支那战争，建立并扩大亚洲和平地区以及反对侵略性的“东南亚集体防务条约”，我们都清楚地看到尼赫鲁先生的贡献。
    中印两国总理和中缅两国总理关于和平共处的五项原则的联合声明，已在亚洲和世界发生了广泛的影响。它不但加强了中印、中缅的友好关系，而且为在亚洲及世界建立集体和平指出了一条明确的道路。我们看到印度尼西亚、锡兰以及亚洲其他国家的人民已表现了同样的意志与愿望。
    亚洲人民要求走和平与繁荣的道路的潮流是不可抗拒的，亚洲和世界和平力量是不可抗拒的。
    在国外的印度侨民和华侨的友谊也表现得极其明显。我还记得，一九四六年尼赫鲁先生到新加坡访问印度侨民，那时，印度还未取得独立地位，中国处在蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治下，新加坡印度商会和我（代表怡和轩俱乐部）共同发起欢迎尼赫鲁先生。中华总商会国民党派因尼赫鲁先生对英国争取独立不敢参加。我在怡和轩俱乐部欢迎会上致词，希望英国守信勿背，并祝印度早日独立；在大小坡多处召开的露天群众欢迎会中，每一回参加的华侨和印度侨民总达数万人。这就证明马来亚三百万华侨与七十多万印侨是友好的，互相关心与同情的。
    印度人民是勤劳、勇敢、爱好和平的，中国人民也是勤劳、勇敢、爱好和平的，近十亿人的友谊合作，对于巩固亚洲与世界和平将具有无可估量的作用。尼赫鲁先生来中国访问，毫无疑义将大大加强两国的历史性的友谊联系。我深信，我们两国人民都有充分的信心和决心，使亚洲免于沦为战争的温床的危险，而变为一个国际和平堡垒。
