The Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been testing and promoting 180 two-wheel double-share plows throughout the region since September, which has been warmly welcomed by farmers. Farmers generally report that the two-wheel double-share plow plows evenly and steadily, requires no human guidance, is very labor-saving, and is even better than a walking plow. Normally, one walking plow pulled by three horses can plow four to five mu of land per day, while a two-wheel double-share plow pulled by four horses can plow twelve to fifteen mu of land. The Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry has now ordered another 6,000 units from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, which will be supplied to farmers next year to help them develop production.

    内蒙古农民喜爱双轮双铧犁
    内蒙古自治区农牧部，九月份以来在全区试验推广一百八十台双轮双铧犁，受到农民热烈的欢迎。农民普遍反映：双轮双铧犁耕的又平又稳，不用人扶，十分省劲，比步犁还要好。平常一架步犁套三匹马一天耕四、五亩地，双轮双铧犁套四匹马能耕地十二到十五亩。现在农牧部又向北京农业机械厂订购了六千台，准备在明年供给农民，帮助农民发展生产。　（本报内蒙古记者站）
