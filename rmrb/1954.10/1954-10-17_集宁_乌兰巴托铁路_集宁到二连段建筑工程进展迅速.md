    Construction of the Jining-Erlian Section Progresses Rapidly
    [This newspaper reports] The construction of the Jining-Erlian section of the railway from Jining in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of our country to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, which is being built by our country, is being accelerated.
    The governments of our country, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Mongolian People's Republic, in order to strengthen the economic and cultural ties between the three countries, signed an agreement on September 15, 1952, to build the railway from Jining in our country to Ulaanbaatar in the Mongolian People's Republic. This railway is scheduled to be connected to the railway from Ulaanbaatar to the Soviet Union next year. The Ji (ning)-Er (lian) line within our country, with a total length of nearly 339 kilometers, started construction in May last year, and the project is progressing rapidly. To date, 87% of the earthwork of the roadbed has been completed; 91% of large and small bridges and culverts have been completed; more than 50,000 square meters of buildings have been constructed; track has been laid for 187 kilometers; and communication lines have been erected near Erlian Station. Trains are transporting large quantities of road-building materials to the construction site along the laid railway. A large amount of earthwork near Erlian is being constructed mechanically, and the construction efficiency is very high.
    All the staff and workers of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of our country, who are building this railway, with the help of the local people's government and farmers and herdsmen, have overcome the difficulties brought to the construction by the strong winds and sand in the desert area. They persisted in winter construction in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius last winter, and this year they overcame the rare flood threat in decades, enabling the construction project to proceed according to the planned schedule. In completing the task, the railway workers have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and have put forward more than 1,200 rationalization proposals. The results of only the more than 600 rationalization proposals that have been implemented and the promotion of advanced working methods have saved the country more than 7 billion yuan. Li Zhongfang, a worker at the Second Sand and Gravel Quarry, created the bottom-expanded blasting method, which increased labor productivity by more than ten times. Zhang Rongcai, a worker in the first squad of the fourth work area and a labor model of the engineering bureau, suggested using cement-added rubble to make the foundation of the bridge, saving the country more than 40 million yuan. The migrant workers participating in the construction of this railway have also actively improved their operating methods and improved their labor efficiency.
    Now, the railway workers are actively preparing for winter construction to ensure that the Jining-Erlian section of the construction project will be completed in 1955 in accordance with the timeframe agreed upon by the governments of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia.

    集宁——乌兰巴托铁路
    集宁到二连段建筑工程进展迅速
    【本报讯】从我国内蒙古自治区集宁到蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托的铁路，由我国负责修建的集宁到二连段线路工程正在加速进行。
    我国政府、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府和蒙古人民共和国政府，为了加强三国互相间的经济和文化的联系，曾经在一九五二年九月十五日签订协定，修建从我国集宁到蒙古人民共和国乌兰巴托的铁路。这条铁路定于明年内同从乌兰巴托到苏联的铁路接通。在我国境内的集（宁）二（连）线，全长近三百三十九公里，已从去年五月间开始动工，工程进展很快。到目前，这条铁路已完成路基土石方工程百分之八十七；大小桥涵完成百分之九十一；建筑房屋五万多平方公尺，铺轨已经到达一百八十七公里；通讯线路已架设到二连车站附近。火车正沿着已经铺好的铁路，把大批筑路材料源源运往施工现场，靠近二连的一部分土方工程，正在大量地采用机械施工，工程效率很高。
    修建这段铁路的我国铁道部第三工程局全体职工，在当地人民政府和农牧民的帮助下，克服了沙漠地带大风沙带给施工的困难。他们在去年冬季零下三十多度严寒的气候下，坚持冬季施工，今年并且战胜了数十年来少有的洪水威胁，使修建工程得以按预定计划进行。在完成任务中，筑路工人发挥了高度积极性、创造性，先后提出了一千二百多件合理化建议。仅计算已实行的六百多件合理化建议和推广先进工作法的结果，就已为国家节约了七十多亿元。第二砂石采集场工人李仲芳创造的底部扩大放炮法，提高了劳动生产率十倍多。四工区一小队工人、工程局劳动模范张荣才，建议使用水泥加大片石做桥梁的基础，为国家节约四千多万元。参加修建这条铁路的民工们，也积极地改进操作方法，提高了劳动效率。
    现在，筑路工人们正积极准备冬季施工，保证在一九五五年按照中、苏、蒙三国政府协定的期限，完成集二段的修建工程。
