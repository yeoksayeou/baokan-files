    Sewing Industry Should Pay Attention to Saving Fabric – Summary of Readers' Letters
    Advocating for the conservation of fabric and opposing waste is the unanimous demand of our nation and all its people. However, according to reflections from many readers' letters, some problems still exist in the sewing industry's garment making. Li Shaohua from Shandong wrote: A few days ago, some comrades wanted to use "Haichang Blue" to make clothes. The local consumer cooperative processing factory only needed 1.5 zhang of fabric for a set of uniforms, but a private clothing store required 1.6 zhang. Using the same fabric to make clothes of the same size, why did the private clothing store need an extra 0.1 zhang of fabric? There is undoubtedly a problem here. Yang Mingfu wrote: I and some comrades who came to Beijing from Chongqing have a common feeling, namely, that clothing stores in Beijing require more fabric than those in Chongqing. For example, a person of average build can make a set of uniforms with 1.4 zhang of fabric in Chongqing, while in Beijing it requires at least 1.5 zhang, even 1.6 or 1.65 zhang. Some individual clothing stores even ask for 1.7 zhang. Hu Ming wrote: Making clothes in private clothing stores always involves wasting some fabric. I myself have encountered such a thing. When you ask them how much fabric is needed for a set of uniforms, they always hope you will buy more. When you have bought a piece of fabric that does not meet their requirements, after some careful calculation, it turns out to be enough. It can be seen that asking for extra fabric indeed increases the burden on the general consumer and wastes the nation's materials.
    Readers also analyzed the reasons why clothing stores ask for extra fabric: Some clothing stores lack careful calculation when cutting clothes; on the contrary, they have the idea of cutting wide and using narrow, wanting more fabric for convenient cutting; some private clothing stores may also have bad intentions, attempting to steal some fabric from it; some may also waste some fabric because of their genuinely poor cutting skills.
    In order to correct the above-mentioned waste phenomenon, readers believe that in addition to the local industrial and commercial administrative departments strengthening leadership and management of the private clothing industry, trade union organizations should also strengthen the education of garment industry workers and systematically mobilize workers to research and learn more scientific cutting methods to improve cutting techniques. Some places have already done this and have achieved great results. For example, since the implementation of planned supply of cotton cloth, the sewing industry in Beijing has studied and developed more than 30 new cutting methods based on the principle of conservation, to cut various clothing items commonly worn by citizens. Using these new cutting methods can not only save 5 to 1 chi of fabric per set of clothing, but also make the clothes strong, durable, and aesthetically pleasing. This practice is worth emulating in various regions.

### 缝纫业应注意节约布料——读者来信综述

    缝纫业应注意节约布料——读者来信综述
    提倡节约布料，反对浪费，这是我们的国家和全体人民的一致要求。但根据不少读者来信反映，有些缝纫业在承制服装中还存在不少问题。山东李少华来信说：几天前有些同志要用“海昌蓝”做衣服，当地消费合作社加工厂一套制服只要一丈五尺布，但一家私营服装店却要一丈六尺。用同样的布做同样大小的衣服，为什么私营服装店却多要一尺布呢？无疑这当中是有问题的。杨明甫来信说：我和一些由重庆来北京的同志，都有一个共同的感觉，即北京的服装店要料子比重庆多，比如一个普通身材的人，在重庆买一丈四尺布就可打一套制服，而在北京打一套制服至少要一丈五尺，甚至还有要一丈六、一丈六尺五，个别服装店还有要一丈七的。胡明来信说：在私营服装店做衣服总会要浪费一些布的。我自己也遇到过这样的事，当你问他们一套制服需要多少布时，他们总是希望多买一些，而当你买好了一块布不能合乎他们的要求时，经过一番精打细算以后也就够用了。可见多要布料，确实是增加了广大消费者的负担，浪费了国家的物资。
    读者并分析了服装店多要布料的原因：有些服装店在剪裁衣服时缺乏精打细算，相反地还存在着宽打窄用的思想，多要些布剪裁方便；有些私营服装店还可能存心不良，企图从中偷些布料；也有一些可能由于剪裁技术实在低劣，因而浪费了一些布料。
    为了纠正上述的浪费现象，读者认为除各地工商行政部门加强对私营服装业的领导和管理外，工会组织也应加强对服装业职工的教育，并有计划地发动工人研究和学习更科学的剪裁方法，提高剪裁的技术。现在有些地方已经这样作了，并已取得了很大的成绩，如北京市的缝纫业自棉布实行计划供应后，根据节约的原则研究出三十多种新的剪裁方法来剪裁市民常穿的各种服装，用这种新的剪裁方法，不仅可使每套服装节省五寸到一尺布料，而且服装结实耐穿，式样美观。这种作法，值得各地仿效。
