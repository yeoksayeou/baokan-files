The Yangtze River receded, the Huai River subsided, and the Yellow River also safely passed through ten flood peaks. After a long and intense struggle, we have finally conquered this year's extraordinary flood. This victory once again demonstrates the superiority of our country's political and economic system, and the unparalleled strength of the new Chinese people in loving their country and resisting natural disasters. This victory is of utmost importance in ensuring the smooth progress of our socialist construction. The people of the whole country express their sincere gratitude and respect to the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, government employees, and all comrades who participated in flood prevention and rescue efforts in various regions, and celebrate this great victory.

This year's flood in our country was the largest in nearly a century. The highest water level at Zhengyangguan was 1.79 meters higher than the highest water level in the history of the Huai River (1931) of 24.62 meters; the highest water level at Hankou was 1.45 meters higher than the highest water level record of the Yangtze River in a century of 28.28 meters, and 2.79 meters higher than the water level when the dike broke in the 1931 flood; the water level of the West River in Tianjin also exceeded the highest record in 1939. In 1931, during the Kuomintang regime, the reactionary rulers showed no concern for the national economy and the people's livelihood, and were extremely incompetent in preventing floods. At that time, although the water level of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers was much lower than this year, it still suffered severe flood disasters across the board. In the Huai River basin, raging waves rushed into Bengbu, crossed the northern dike of the Huai River, flooded the Jinpu Railway, and poured directly into Jiangsu Province, breaking through the canal dikes and sweeping across the Lixiahe area. In the Yangtze River basin, coastal cities and villages, including the pseudo-capital Nanjing, were submerged in water, and the water in Wuhan City could not be drained for four months. In 1931, 3.7 million people died of famine throughout the country, and according to the figures released by the pseudo-Relief Committee, more than 265,000 people were drowned in the Yangtze and Huai River basins alone.

However, in New China, the situation is completely different. In July and August, the Huai River experienced five sudden and rapid flood peaks; from June 26th to October 3rd, for a full 100 days, the water level at Hankou was above the warning level, but the flood was finally blocked and conquered. Although the flood situation this year was greater than in 1931, the disaster was much smaller than at that time. This achievement is not only incomparable to the Kuomintang rule, but also unprecedented in Chinese history.

Why were we able to achieve such results? And what do our victories illustrate about some problems?

Our victory was achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and People's Government. This victory once again demonstrates a truth to the people of the whole country, that is, following the Communist Party leads to eternal victory. We all know that in the few years since the founding of New China, the Party and the government have been very concerned about water conservancy construction, and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Huai River Water Conservancy Project, and the Guanting Reservoir have all played a significant role in this year's struggle against floods. Without these projects, it would be unimaginable to overcome this year's extraordinary flood. We also all know that in the early stages of flood prevention in various regions this year, some people underestimated the flood situation and developed a paralyzing mentality of侥幸; when the flood rose sharply and the water level approached and exceeded historical records, some people became panicked and at a loss, and developed pessimistic and negative emotions; and when the flood's upward trend weakened and began to recede, some people developed complacency and laxity. The Party and government leading organs promptly criticized these deviations, pointed out the conditions for victory, explained the principle that "man can conquer nature," and vigorously organized forces from all aspects to participate in the flood prevention and rescue struggle. Without the ideological leadership and organizational leadership of the Party and the government, it would be impossible to conquer this year's flood. Yang Mingcong, a construction worker who participated in the flood prevention struggle and won the first-class merit twice, said it well: "Before the water flooded in, the Party put forward the call to give flood prevention top priority; before the water rose, the dikes were built; when the water rose, the dikes were already built and raised. After the flood peak passed, the Party again called for overcoming pride, complacency,麻痹and laxity. Without the Party, everything would be over." Because of this, the broad masses of the people further recognized the consistency between the Communist Party and the interests of the people in the struggle, and the prestige of the Communist Party was further enhanced among the people. In the more than three months of struggle in Wuhan, more than 8,000 people gloriously joined the Communist Party, and more than 15,500 people joined the New Democratic Youth League, which eloquently proves this truth.

Our victory was achieved through the courageous efforts of millions of people on the front lines of flood prevention. They demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, collectivism, and revolutionary heroism in the struggle, and gave full play to their initiative and creative wisdom. Their heroic deeds prove that as long as millions of people are united together under the leadership of the Party, they can overcome any difficulties and create historical miracles. When the flood situation in the Huai River was tense, more than 800,000 people participated in flood prevention work. They guarded the dikes day and night and generally widened and heightened the dikes by more than one meter in a short period of time. Tens of thousands of migrant workers on the canal dikes fought continuously for seventeen hours and overcame difficulties when the lower reaches of the Huai River were hit by typhoons in late August. Among the nearly 300,000-strong Wuhan flood prevention army, more than 15,900 people were selected as heroes, including Luo Guangtian, Le Jinyuan, Jia Mingwu, Han Youmei, etc. Some of them persisted in blocking the water despite being seriously injured, some blocked loopholes with their own bodies, and some dedicated their lives when rescuing huge dangerous projects. Their heroic deeds inspired the broad masses of the people, and the people will never forget them.

Our victory was also achieved with the active assistance and support of farmers along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. It once again proves that the worker-peasant alliance in our country is an unbreakable and huge force. Throughout the entire struggle, the broad masses of farmers not only actively participated in dike construction and rescue struggles, but also in the Hubei region, some rural areas repeatedly sacrificed their temporary interests and voluntarily diverted and stored floodwater in order to reduce the pressure of the flood and ensure that the cities along the river, the Jingjiang Dike, and the vast rural areas were not flooded. Many farmers said: The industrial construction of the city is our lifeline, and we must protect it. These examples once again illustrate the improvement of the farmers' awareness after the land reform and the general line propaganda. The selfless spirit of sacrifice of the farmers and their concept of subordinating small interests to big interests and subordinating partial interests to overall interests formed a huge force and played an extremely important role in this year's flood prevention struggle.

Our victory was also achieved with the unanimous support of the whole country. This spirit of mutual help and sharing of weal and woe once again demonstrates the unprecedented unity of the people of our country and the superiority of our political and economic system. Take the Wuhan flood prevention struggle as an example again, their struggle was not isolated. Throughout the entire flood prevention period, as long as they requested assistance from any region's Party organization and government, they would immediately receive an enthusiastic response: Jilin Province sent grass bags overnight, Hubei Province quickly sent timber, handicraft workers in Guangzhou and other places processed and weaved bamboo cables, Shanghai transported iron anchors, Taiyuan transported vegetables, and Sichuan transported rice; and in cities even farther away, people were inquiring diligently: "We have potatoes and dried fish, do you need them?" The support from various places added tremendous strength and infinite confidence to the people in the flood prevention areas, and also enhanced their political awareness and love for the great motherland. The people of Wuhan said: "No matter how big the water is, the strength is just as big, whatever we need we have, China under the leadership of Chairman Mao is like one family." These words are very correct. The reason why the people of New China can show such a unified and concentrated force is, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "When the people are still in a state of being oppressed, it is impossible to fully concentrate their will and strength. The Chinese people were ridiculed in the past as 'a heap of loose sand,' and this was the reason. The revolution has concentrated the will and strength of the people." ("Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China")

Our victory has been affirmed, and our victory is great. This victory has inspired the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to build socialism, and has also won the praise of all peace-loving and democratic international friends. The only ones disappointed are the imperialist warmongers and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan. When they could not overwhelm the newborn People's China with conspiracies, sabotage, provocations, and armed intervention, they had no choice but to hope that natural disasters would ruin us. Therefore, they expressed a very gloating attitude towards the floods in our country, and babbled nonsense that the floods were "a heavy blow" to the prestige of the Communist Party and the People's Government, "will greatly delay the economic construction plan of Communist China," and "the flood has tolled the death knell for the Communist regime." However, the facts are exactly the opposite of their hopes. Throughout the entire flood prevention struggle, the consistency between the interests of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the interests of the people was fully demonstrated, and the flesh-and-blood connection and close relationship between the Party and the people were demonstrated. This is the spiritual and material foundation for the Party and the people's contact to be continuously strengthened and consolidated, and to lead the people from victory to victory. After the test of the flood prevention struggle, the unity of the people of the whole country has been further consolidated; although we have also suffered some disasters, we will certainly be able to remedy them with the efforts of the people of the whole country.

Under the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of our country also deeply know that we should not be complacent and relaxed at any time and in the face of any victory. The tasks before us are still very arduous. We firmly believe that as long as the people of the whole country make persistent efforts and persevere, we will certainly be able to achieve new victories. Let us continue to move forward under the banner of Mao Zedong!

    我们战胜了洪水
    长江落，淮水降，黄河也平安地度过了十次洪峰。经过长期紧张的斗争，我们已最后地战胜了今年特大的洪水。这个胜利，再一次地显示了我国政治经济制度的优越性，显示了新中国人民热爱祖国和抗拒自然灾害的无比的力量。这个胜利，对保证我国社会主义建设事业的顺利进行，有着极其重要的意义。全国人民都以感激和尊敬的心情，向各地参加防汛抢险的工人、农民、部队、学生、机关工作人员和全体工作同志，表示崇高的敬意，庆祝这个巨大的胜利。今年我国洪水之大，为近百年来所罕有。正阳关最高水位曾比淮河历史上最大洪水年（一九三一年）的二四点六二公尺高出一点七九公尺；武汉关最高水位曾比长江百年来最高水位纪录的二八点二八公尺高出一点四五公尺，比一九三一年洪水破堤时的水位高出二点七九公尺；天津西河的水位，也超过了一九三九年的最高纪录。一九三一年，在国民党政权时期，反动统治者对国计民生既毫不关心，对防御洪水也十分低能。那时，江淮水位虽比今年低得多，仍全面遭受了洪水泛滥的严重灾害。在淮河流域，惊涛骇浪闯入了蚌埠，越过淮河北堤，漫过津浦铁路，并直泻江苏省，突破运河堤防，横扫里下河地区。在长江流域，沿岸城市和乡村，包括伪首都南京在内，都被浸在水里，武汉市渍水四个月未能排出。一九三一年全国死于灾荒者达三百七十万人，根据伪赈务委员会公布的数字，只江淮流域被淹死者就达二十六万五千余人。但是，在新中国，情况就完全不同了。七、八两月，淮河曾先后出现了五次猛急的洪峰；六月二十六日至十月三日整整一百天，武汉关洪水都在警戒水位以上，可是洪水终于被挡住了，被战胜了。今年的水情虽比一九三一年大，但灾情却比那时小得多。这个成绩，不仅国民党统治时期无法与之相比，就是在中国历史上也是没有的。
    我们为什么能取得这样的成绩呢？我们的胜利又说明了一些什么问题呢？
    我们的胜利是在中国共产党和人民政府领导下取得的。这个胜利再次向全国人民说明了一个真理，这就是跟着共产党走就能永远胜利。我们大家都知道，在新中国成立的几年内，党和政府对水利建设事业是十分关怀的，而其中的荆江分洪、淮河水利工程和官厅水库，在今年抗拒洪水的斗争中也都起了显著的作用，没有这些工程，要战胜今年的特大洪水，是不可想像的。我们也都知道，今年各地防洪初期，若干人曾轻视水情，产生麻痹侥幸心理；当洪水陡涨，水位接近和超过历史最高纪录的时候，若干人又表现得惊慌失措，产生了悲观消极情绪；而在洪水涨势转弱并开始回落的时候，有些人又产生了松懈和自满情绪。党和政府领导机关，及时地批判了这些偏向，指出了胜利的条件，说明了“人定可以胜天”的道理，并大力组织了各方面的力量参加防汛抢险斗争。没有党和政府的思想领导和组织领导，要战胜今年的洪水也是不可能的。一位参加防汛斗争的建筑工人、两次荣获一等功的杨明聪说得好，他说：“水还没有淹来，党就提出了防汛压倒一切的号召；水还没有涨到，就修起了堤；水涨来了，堤早就修好修高了。洪峰过了，党又提出要克服骄傲自满麻痹松懈情绪。要没有党，什么都会完了。”正因为这样，广大人民在斗争中更进一步地认清了共产党和人民利益的一致，共产党的威信在人民中也更进一步的提高了。武汉市在三个多月的斗争中，有八千多人光荣地参加了共产党，有一万五千五百多人参加了新民主主义青年团，事实雄辩地说明了这个真理。
    我们的胜利是在防汛最前线千百万人民的奋勇努力下取得的。他们在斗争中表现了高度的爱国主义、集体主义和革命英雄主义的精神，发挥了高度的积极性和创造智慧。他们的英雄事迹，证明了只要在党的领导下，千百万人民团结在一起，就能战胜任何困难，创造历史的奇迹。在淮河汛情紧张的时候，参加防汛工作的有八十多万人，他们日夜坚守在堤防上，并在短期内将堤岸普遍加宽加高了一公尺以上。运河堤上的数万民工，当八月下旬淮河下流遭到台风袭击时，他们曾连续搏斗十七小时，战胜了困难。在将近三十万人的武汉市防汛大军里，有一万五千九百多人被评选为功臣，其中如罗光田、乐金元、贾明武、韩友梅等等，他们有的身负重伤仍坚持堵水工作，有的用自己的身体堵住漏洞，有的在抢救巨大险工时贡献了自己的生命。他们的英雄事迹，鼓舞着广大人民，人民将永远不会忘记他们。
    我们的胜利也是在长江、淮河沿岸农民的积极协助和支持下取得的。它再一次证明了我国工农联盟是一个牢不可破的巨大力量。在整个斗争过程中，广大农民不仅积极参加了堤防工程和抢险斗争，在湖北地区，若干农村还几次不惜牺牲自己的暂时利益，主动分洪蓄水，以便减轻洪水的压力，保障沿江城市、荆江大堤和广大农村不被水淹。许多农民都说：城市的工业建设是我们的大命根子，一定要保住它。这些事例，再次说明了土地改革和总路线宣传以后农民觉悟的提高。农民们的这种忘我的牺牲精神以及小利服从大利、局部服从整体的观念，形成了一个巨大的力量，并在今年防汛斗争中起了极其重要的作用。
    我们的胜利也是在全国一致支援下取得的。这种互相帮助、患难与共的精神，再一次表现了我国人民的空前团结和我国政治经济制度的优越性。仍以武汉市的防汛斗争为例，它们的斗争不是孤立的。在整个防汛期间，只要他们向任何一个地区的党组织和政府请求援助，他们立即会得到热情的答复：吉林省连夜送去了草袋，湖北省迅速送到了木料，广州等地的手工业工人加工编织了篾缆，上海运去了铁锚，太原运去了蔬菜，四川运去了大米；而在更远的城市里，还有人殷勤地询问：“我们有土豆、干鱼，你们要不要？”各地的支援，给防汛地区人民增加了巨大的力量和无限的信心，也提高了他们的政治觉悟和对伟大祖国的热爱。武汉市的人民说：“水有好大，力量就有好大，要什么有什么，毛主席领导的中国像一家人一样。”这些话是很正确的。新中国人民之所以能表现出这样统一集中的力量，正如刘少奇同志指出的：“人民当自己还处在被压迫地位的时候，不可能把自己的意志和力量充分地集中起来。中国人民在过去被人讥笑为
  ‘一盘散沙’，就是由于这个原因。革命使得人民的意志和力量集中起来了。”（“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”）
    我们的胜利已经肯定了，我们的胜利是巨大的。这个胜利，鼓舞了全国人民建设社会主义事业的热情，也博得了一切爱好和平民主的国际友人的赞扬。失望的只有帝国主义战争贩子和台湾的蒋介石卖国匪徒。当他们用阴谋破坏、挑拨离间和武装干涉都不能压倒新生的人民中国的时候，他们就只好希望自然灾害来败坏我们，因此他们对我国的洪水曾经表示了十分的幸灾乐祸的态度，并胡言乱语地说道：水灾对共产党和人民政府的威望“是一个沉重的打击”，“将使共产党中国的经济建设计划大大拖延下来”，“大水给共产党政权敲起了丧钟”。然而，事实和他们的希望恰恰相反。在整个防汛斗争中，充分表现了共产党、人民政府的利益和人民群众利益的一致性，表现了党和人民群众是血肉相联、息息相关的，这也就是党和人民群众的联系能够不断加强和巩固，能够领导人民从胜利走向胜利的精神的和物质的基础。经过防汛斗争的考验，全国人民的团结更巩固了；虽然我们也遭到了一些灾害，但在全国人民的努力下，我们也一定能够补救起来的。
    在毛泽东同志的教导下，我国人民也深深地知道，在任何时候和任何胜利面前，我们都不应该产生自满和松懈情绪。目前摆在我们面前的任务还是十分艰巨的。我们深信，只要全国人民再接再厉，坚持不懈，我们就一定能取得新的胜利。让我们在毛泽东的旗帜下继续前进吧！
