    I Saw the Tomorrow of the Motherland
    ——Viewing the Achievements of Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Exhibition
  　Kang Tuo
    A brand-new building opens its arms wide. In the center of the square in front of the gate, the fountain's spray weaves fireworks in the sunlight. On the highway leading to the Summer Palace and the Western Hills in the western suburbs of Beijing, cars surge like rolling waves towards this building; an endless stream of people, facing the "fireworks" in the square, pours into the building's embrace.
    This building—the Soviet Exhibition Hall, uses its red star soaring into the sky as its symbol. The national emblems of the great Soviet Union and its sixteen republics guard the red star. Below the red star, the sculptures of four vigorous Soviet men and women cordially lead the crowd to the entrance of the exhibition. The orange-yellow colored walls and high, wide doors suddenly brighten our eyes. Everyone seems to see the days of the motherland's tomorrow. Everyone will bring memories of their entire life, fantasies of many years, and the demands of the construction posts they just left, and quickly step into the gate of tomorrow, pass through the central hall, and head to the industrial hall... Oh, what is socialist industrialization? This is it, this is it!—People's hearts are stirred, and they can't help but immediately say this sentence.
    I remember last spring, in the mine shafts of the Hegang Coal Mine, I squatted with the workers on the jet-black coal, listening to them talk with laughter about the happiness brought by the new Soviet coal mining machines. Nearly three years ago, I also saw the process of making cars and steel bars in factories in Moscow and Stalingrad. Now, the industrial hall comprehensively displays the power of socialist industry for us. Through exhibits and charts, we saw the azure Caspian Sea and the oil of Baku, saw more than a hundred types of steel and steel plates that serve as the spine of industry; through exquisite and beautiful models, we saw the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station, and the world's rare 100,000-kilowatt hydrogen-cooled turbo generator. In the exhibition halls on both sides of the hall, we saw the force of industry advancing to the ocean, high altitude, and the Arctic; from the east and west squares, we saw excavators and automatic conveyor belts, and heavy-duty trucks with mighty heads and thick waists that automatically load and unload twenty-five tons. I don't know which factory workers we had, surrounding the four-axis automatic turret lathe in the industrial hall that can perform four processes simultaneously, their eyeballs almost drilled into every tiny crevice of the lathe. Other people watched motionless the latest optical profile grinder and automatic loom, watched dozens of other machines, each with its unique shape and style. Machines cannot speak, so Soviet workers left their own workshops and came here, standing in front of the exhibits turning the machines, answering all questions from the people; and teaching the operating techniques to the Chinese workers by hand. When people leave these Soviet friends, they will say "Thank you!" with deep affection! The friends also immediately said in newly learned Chinese: "Thank you!" and a smile emerged from the deepest part of their eyes...
    Seeing the smiling faces of friends and the power of machines, we excitedly raised our heads. Ah! We saw on the front wall, statues of Lenin and Stalin standing majestically, their outstretched arms covering all the machines, beckoning us, and also indicating the days of our tomorrow... Yes, everything here is a product of Marxism-Leninism; and what are all these machines born for? Please look at the explanation on the wall next to the statue: "The purpose of Soviet socialist production development is to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society."
    I kept this sentence in mind, followed the crowd, breathed the full atmosphere of life in the vast exhibition, and admired my own realistic tomorrow. I couldn't help but, like everyone else, linger for a long time in the cultural life hall in the east hall. Is this just a cultural life hall in an exhibition? This is an ordinary Soviet family, with four beautiful and comfortable rooms: a studio, bedroom, dining room, and lounge. Perhaps this is the residence of one of the Soviet workers in front of the exhibition stand in the industrial hall? Yes, the worker families I visited in Moscow and Stalingrad were just like the scene here. Of course, this is still an exhibition hall, a family that has not been fully furnished. But anyone can go to the handicraft hall with upright wooden carved pillars nearby, and choose your favorite embroidered tablecloths and printed curtains, choose crystal vases and shining lacquer boxes, as well as colorful carpets and cosmetics; then, you can design as you wish and decorate these rooms more beautifully. And you can also choose radios and televisions from the nearby exhibition hall, and music lovers can certainly find the various instruments they need. As for the paintings decorating the walls, the art gallery opposite has arranged two or three hundred world-class works for you. You will naturally like "Great Friendship," and maybe you will also like the group of girls like morning glow in "We Are Going to Life." Or, do you want to put the statue of "First Grade Girl" on the bedside? Or want to hang a historical picture, a portrait of a labor hero or scientist or artist from industry and agriculture, by the window? Here is like the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow; here every work that can be displayed in the family, everyone knows that it is by no means just a simple decoration, but mainly reflects the glorious history of the great Soviet Union, reflects the rich and colorful today and tomorrow of the Soviet people...
    Maybe I'm imagining a bit naively. In fact, probably no family can choose from the countless and endless material and cultural treasures in the various halls of the exhibition. However, besides the above, could there be any family that could forget to go to the second floor of the industrial hall to admire and choose the clothing for spring, summer, autumn, and winter and children's toys? Could there be any family that could forget the publication and vocational education hall and higher education hall between the art gallery and the cultural life hall, and not be closely related to the textbooks, instruments, and models of Moscow University that cultivate future people there? And the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, representing the highest wisdom of mankind, as well as the works of Lomonosov and Pavlov, the poems of Tolstoy and Gorky, these are inexhaustible sources of wisdom, essential spiritual nourishment for every ordinary Soviet family; and naturally they are also nourishment that enriches our today and tomorrow...
    "We Soviet people are willing to give all our best to the great Chinese people!" This is what a rolling worker named Troshin from the Red October Metallurgical Plant in Stalingrad said to me in the winter of 1951. Now, in this exhibition hall, there is indeed everything, with all the best things that the Soviet people have sent us.
    These pearl-like things make our hearts purer and our upward demands stronger. When we enter the agricultural hall in the west hall, everyone will be excited and nervous. What is this? Is it the wheat grain in the myth? Is it the cotton that can only be seen in dreams? The sow with its breasts hanging low in the picture cannot but be surprising, and the potatoes are more like the scene under a magnifying glass. And these products are not only prominent for their appearance; through actual investigation and explanations on colored charts, you can fully feel the rich, high-quality harvest on the Soviet land. You can also fully believe from the many agricultural machines outside the hall that guarantee bumper harvests that the harvest of Soviet land will continue to increase endlessly. Look, what a big guy that red automatic grain combine harvester is! It can harvest more than 300 acres of grain a day, which is incomparably larger than manpower! And among the various machines for cultivating, sowing, transplanting seedlings, and killing insects, the tractor that our farmers have been waiting for day and night has eight different uses...
    I used to live in the remote mountainous areas of Hebei and Shanxi for a long time. Just last year and this year, I also met simple farmers in that area who asked me: "Can machines be used to cultivate our mountainous land in the future?" I replied: "Of course." But my answer was also heard, and I had not found evidence in the field. Now, among the team of agricultural machines in the square, a horse-drawn reversible plow with a front cart silently solves this problem. This plow is simply a lovely guy who is considerate to the farmers in the mountains, not only can it plow back and forth on the slopes, but also can work on small plots of land, and take care of multiple tasks such as turning the soil, scraping grass residue, and breaking up soil in one go.
    From here, everyone will see the closer tomorrow of our worker-peasant alliance. And when you go deeper into the agricultural hall and see the abundant melons, vegetables, and food, see the Michurin apples and grapes that seem to have fallen from the green fresco fruit trees onto the display stand, you will no longer be surprised; and you will definitely have an appetite and want to enter the connected gate, sit down in the green-walled and shady restaurant, and have a satisfying meal. Then, your vitality will be more abundant; you will go to the hall in front of the food industry hall to watch movies, go to the beautiful and spacious open-air theater behind the industrial hall to watch songs and dances; or step down the steps at the rear of the theater and walk by the peaceful artificial lake...
    The huge scale of the exhibition hall may make people forget the time of day. When you step on the walkways between the flowers and the green grass with deep affection, and walk out of the gate of this building, it may already be a sky full of stars. And when you turn around again, you will find the symbol of the red star whose light surpasses all the stars. Ah, you stopped again! Probably something is boiling in your chest! Yes, comrade, you don't need to say it, I'm the same as you. We will all relive everything in the exhibition hall, and our thoughts will fly everywhere...
    From the Soviet friends who operate the machines in front of the exhibition stand, we will think of the Soviet experts who are working hard day and night to help us in various construction posts. We will also think of how Soviet engineers painstakingly blended the style of our national architectural traditions in the design from this magnificent exhibition hall itself. We will also recall the photo of Chinese student Qian Gaoyun and his Soviet classmate Annashkin studying together on the wall of the higher education hall; and we will recall the Russian "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" on the book exhibition stand, as well as translated versions of many works by our scientists and writers. On the vase in the handicraft hall, you can see the decoration of Chinese patterns; in the art gallery, Soviet painters sent the original manuscripts of their cartoons severely criticizing US imperialism for supporting Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of Taiwan, and also sent illustrations engraved for Lu Xun's novels. And, it's not just these. We also saw the unyielding land of Korea and the fiery jungle of Indochina from the art gallery, publications, and vocational education hall, and saw the huge peaceful arms of the Soviet people extended to all mankind... Does this exhibition hall only have those countable 11,500 exhibits? No, here is also the world's first nuclear power plant, the firm steps of the entire Soviet people towards communism, and the guarantee that the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the increasingly powerful Soviet Union will continue to achieve victory.
    When we finally leave the exhibition hall, we are full of energy. Looking up into the distance, we see countless steel bases and automobile factories being built in our country under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong; see the results of the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition" being promoted farther and deeper; see agricultural production cooperatives developing irresistibly forward in the mountains and plains of the motherland... Towards the infinitely beautiful days of tomorrow, we return to our posts, and everyone feels that they should do their work better.

    我看到了祖国的明天
    ——看苏联经济及文化建设成就展览
  　康濯
    一座全新的建筑敞开着胸怀。在门前的广场中央，喷泉的水花在阳光下织成了焰火。在通往北京西郊颐和园和西山的公路上，汽车像滚滚的波涛涌向这座建筑；无尽的人流，迎着广场上的“焰火”，涌入建筑的胸怀里。
    这座建筑——苏联展览馆，以自己临空远照的红星作为标志。伟大苏联和十六个加盟共和国的国徽拱卫着红星。红星下四个朝气勃勃的苏联男女的雕像，亲切地把人群引到展览会的进口。橙黄的彩壁和高阔的大门，使我们的眼睛突然一亮。每一个人都好像看见了祖国明天的日子。每一个人都会带着自己全部生活的回忆，带着多年的幻想和刚刚离开的建设岗位的要求，赶紧迈进明天的大门，通过中央大厅，走向工业馆……唔，什么是社会主义的工业化？这就是，这就是！——人们的胸头激动，制不住地马上要说出这句话来。
    记得去年春天，我曾在鹤岗煤矿的坑洞里，和工人们一道蹲在墨玉似的煤块上，听他们笑声朗朗地谈起过苏联的新式采煤机带来的幸福。将近三年以前，我还在莫斯科和斯大林格勒的工厂里，看到过汽车和钢条的制作过程。现在，工业馆里给我们全面展开了社会主义工业的力量。我们通过展品和图表，看见了碧蓝的里海和巴库的石油，看见了作为工业的脊梁的一百多种钢材和钢板；通过精巧美妙的模型，看见了第聂伯尔水力发电站，看见了世上稀有的十万瓩氢冷式汽轮发电机。在大厅两侧的陈列馆里，看见工业的力量突进到海洋、高空和北极；从东面和西面的广场上，看到掘土机和自动传送带，看到自动装卸二十五吨的巨首雄腰的载重汽车。不知道是我们哪一个工厂的工人，围着工业馆内能同时进行四道工序的四轴自动镟床，他们的眼珠简直钻进了镟床里每一个细微的缝隙。另外的人们一动都不动地看着那最新式的光学曲线磨床和自动织机，看着另外几十部各有着自己独特的体形和风格的机器。机器不能说话，于是，苏联工人离开他们自己工作的车间，来到这里，站在展品台前转动着机器，回答人们的一切问题；并且把着手儿，把操作技术教给中国工人。当人们离开这些苏联朋友的时候，都要深情地说一声“谢谢！”朋友们也马上说着刚刚学会的中国话：“谢谢！”并从眼窝的最深处露出笑来……
    看到朋友的笑脸和机器的力量，我们兴奋地抬起了头。啊！我们看见了正面的墙根，列宁斯大林的塑像雄伟地站立着，伸出来的手臂盖过一切机器，在向我们招呼，也在指示着我们明天的日子……不错，这里的一切都是马克思列宁主义的产品；而这所有机器的诞生为了什么？请看塑像旁边的墙头上的说明吧：“苏联社会主义生产发展的目的是保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。”
    我牢记着这一句话，跟着人群，在广阔的展览会里呼吸着饱满的生活气息，欣赏着自己的现实的明天。我不能不和每一个人一样，在东面大厅的文化生活馆里久久地停留。这难道仅仅是展览会里的文化生活馆么？这是一个普通苏联人的家庭，有工作室、卧室、饭厅和休息室四个美丽、舒适的房间。也许这就是工业馆的展览台前哪一个苏联工人的住宅？是的，我在莫斯科和斯大林格勒拜访过的工人家庭，就跟这里的情景一样。当然，这到底还是一个展览馆，是一个并没有全部陈设起来的家庭。但任何人都可以就近走到那直立着木头雕花圆柱的手工艺品馆里，挑选你喜爱的刺绣台布和印花窗帘，挑选水晶花瓶和闪光的漆盒，以及彩色的地毯和化装品；然后，你可以随心设计，把这些房间更漂亮地布置起来。你并且也可以从就近的陈列馆里挑选收音机和电视机，音乐爱好者当然也可以找到你需要的各种乐器。至于装饰墙头的画幅，在对面的美术馆里给你安排了二三百件世界第一流的作品。你自然会喜欢“伟大的友谊”，也许你还会喜欢“我们走向生活”当中那一群朝霞似的姑娘。或者，你是希望把“一年级女生”的雕像摆在床头？还是想把哪一个历史的画面，把哪一个工农业劳动英雄或科学家、艺术家的肖像挂在窗台边上？这里有如莫斯科的特列奇雅可夫美术馆；这里每一件可供家庭陈设的作品，谁都知道决不仅仅只是简单的装饰，而主要是反映着伟大苏联的光荣历史，反映着苏联人民丰富多采的今天和明天……
    也许我设想得有些天真。事实上，哪一个家庭怕都远不能从展览会的各个馆里，去挑选那数不尽看不完的许多物质和文化的宝物。然而，除了上面那些，莫非还会有哪一个家庭能够忘记走上工业馆的二楼，去欣赏和选择那春夏秋冬的服装和儿童玩具？莫非更会有哪一个家庭能够忘记那美术馆和文化生活馆中间的出版物和职业教育馆和高等教育馆，能够不跟那里培养未来人物的课本、仪器和莫斯科大学的模型有着密切的关联？还有那马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的代表着人类最高智慧的著作，以及罗蒙诺索夫和巴甫洛夫的作品，托尔斯泰和高尔基的诗篇，这些都是汲取不尽的智慧的源泉，是每一个普通的苏联家庭一时都不可缺少的精神养料；自然也都是丰富我们今天和明天的生活的养料……
    “我们苏联人都愿意把我们最好的一切送给伟大的中国人民！”这是斯大林格勒红十月冶金工厂一个名叫特洛希尼的压延工人，在一九五一年冬天对我说过的话。现在，在这个展览馆里，的确是应有尽有，有着苏联人民给我们送来的一切最好的东西。
    这些珠玉般的东西，使我们的心地更加纯真，使我们向上的要求更加强烈。当我们走进西侧大厅的农业馆，我们每个人都会激动得紧张起来。这是什么？是不是神话中的麦粒？是不是梦里才能看见的棉花？图片上那乳房累累的母猪不能不叫人大吃一惊，马铃薯更像是放在扩大镜下边的情景。而这些产品不仅以它的外貌显赫于人；通过实际的考察和彩色图表的说明，你完全可以感受到苏维埃土地上丰饶的、品质高超的收获。你更可以从馆外广场上那保证丰收的许多农业机器，完全相信苏维埃土地的收获还要永无止境地提高。你看，那满身红色的自动谷物联合收割机是个多大的家伙！每天能收割三百多亩谷物，比人力大到不可计算！而在各种耕作、播种、移苗和杀虫的机器中间，为我们的农民日夜盼望的拖拉机，就有着用途各不相同的八部……
    我曾经在河北和山西的偏僻山区生活过许多时间。就在去年和今年，我还碰见过那一带的纯朴的农民向我发问：“咱们这山地将来能不能使机器种地？”我回答道：“当然能。”但我的答案也是听来的，并没有实地找到过证据。如今，在广场上农业机器的队伍里面，一部带有前车的马拉翻转犁不声不响地解决了这个问题。这种犁简直是一个对山地的农民体贴入微的可爱的家伙，不仅可以在坡地上来回翻耕，而且可以在小块的田地上工作，并把翻土、刮草渣和打碎土块等多种劳动一次就全给包揽起来。
    从这里，谁也会看到我们工农联盟的更加亲密的明天。而当你再走进农业馆的深处，看到丰盛的瓜菜和食品，看到仿佛是从绿色壁画的果树上掉到展品台的米丘林苹果和葡萄，你一定会不再惊讶；并且一定会食欲冲动，要走进相连的那个大门，在绿壁阴凉的餐厅里坐下，满足地饱吃一顿。然后，你的生活力会更加充沛；会去到食品工业馆前面的大厅看电影，去到工业馆后面那美丽宽阔的露天剧场里看歌舞；或是步下剧场后尾的台阶，在平静的人造湖边散步……
    展览馆的巨大的规模，也许会使人忘记一天的时刻。当你深情难舍地踏着花间的甬道和青青的草地，走出这座建筑的大门，说不定已经是繁星满天。而当你再一次回过头来，你又会发现那亮光超越过一切星星的红星的标志。啊，你又站住了！大概是什么东西在你的胸头沸腾起来了吧！是的，同志，你不用说，我跟你一样。我们都会重温着展览馆里的一切，我们的思想都会四处飞驰……
    我们从展品台前操作机器的苏联朋友，会想到在各个建设岗位上日夜辛劳地帮助我们的苏联专家。也会从这座辉煌的展览馆本身，想到苏联的工程师们是如何苦心地在设计当中融会着我们民族建筑传统的格调。我们还会想起那高等教育馆的墙头，中国留学生钱高云和他的苏联同学安纳什金一道学习的图片；更会想起那书籍展览台上俄文的“毛泽东选集”，以及许多我国科学家和作家的作品的译本。在手工艺品馆的花瓶上，可以看到中国图案的装饰；在美术馆里，苏联的画家送来了他们严厉指责美帝国主义支持蒋介石侵占台湾的漫画原稿，也送来了为鲁迅的小说刻制的插图。而且，还不只这些。我们还从美术馆、出版物和职业教育馆里，看到了朝鲜的不屈的土地和印度支那的火热的丛林，看到了苏联人民向全人类伸出的巨大的和平的手臂……这个展览馆里难道只有那数得清的一万一千五百多件展品么？不，这里还有着世界上第一个原子能发电站，有着整个苏联人民坚强地迈向共产主义的脚步声，有着以日益强大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营将要不断取得胜利的保证。
    当我们最后离开展览馆，我们浑身是劲。抬头远望，我们看见在毛泽东同志的领导下，正在我国建设起来的无数钢铁基地和汽车工厂；看见“鞍钢技术革新展览会”的成果推广得愈远愈深；看见在祖国的山地和平川，农业生产合作社正在不可阻挡地向前发展……我们朝着无限美好的明天的日子，回到自己的岗位上，每一个人都感觉到要把自己的工作作得更好一些。
