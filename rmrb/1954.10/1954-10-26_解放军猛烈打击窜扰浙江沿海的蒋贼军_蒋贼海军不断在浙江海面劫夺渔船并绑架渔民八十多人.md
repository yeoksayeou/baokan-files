    Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 25th. Under the instruction of the American aggressors, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops continue to intrude into the coastal areas of Zhejiang.
    At 19:15 on the 10th, one Chiang Kai-shek bandit warship and one gunboat shelled Toumenshan Island with 32 rounds. Our People's Liberation Army immediately retaliated fiercely, driving back these two Chiang Kai-shek bandit ships. On the 15th, Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships and gunboats shelled fishermen fishing near Liangmao Island with more than 240 rounds. Our artillery, guarding a certain island, immediately fired back, covering the fishermen's transfer to a safe area. At 02:05 on the 21st, two Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships shelled Tian'ao Island with 140 rounds, while simultaneously shelling Toumenshan Island with 103 rounds. At 11:48 on the 18th, one Chiang Kai-shek RT-33 jet reconnaissance aircraft intruded into Fenghua, Ningbo, and other areas of Zhejiang Province for harassment. Our People's Liberation Army Air Force took off to intercept, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft fled towards the outer sea.
    At 01:00 on October 2nd, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Yijiangshan Island dispatched a group of armed special agents to sneak onto the southwest highlands of Tian'ao Island. This group of armed special agents was immediately打击by our island garrison troops, and after several were wounded, they fled in a panic. Our army seized one American-made pistol and one bayonet.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 23rd. Our coastal defense troops on the Zhejiang front have routed a reinforced platoon of landing Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops.
    At 05:50 on the morning of the 22nd, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Jishan Island in southeastern Zhejiang, under the cover of two warships and one gunboat, used more than 60 men in a reinforced platoon aboard five sailing boats to conduct landing harassment in the coastal area of ​​Jiucaigyuan (in Pingyang County), eastern Zhejiang. The first sailing boat of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, with fifteen men, first landed on Lao Ying Reef close to the mainland southwest of Guan Shan, and then transferred to sampans to land at Jiucaigyuan. Our People's Liberation Army coastal defense troops guarding the Jiucaigyuan area suddenly opened fire and attacked the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops with calm and courageous actions as soon as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops landed on the land, completely defeating the landing Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in one fell swoop, capturing three Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops alive on the spot. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the four sailing boats behind, seeing the situation was not good, hurriedly turned around and fled back to Nanji Mountain.
    The two Chiang Kai-shek bandit warships that came to cover the landing fired more than 200 shells at our coastal mainland, wounding one local resident and destroying more than ten civilian houses.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, 25th: Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit navy has been continuously robbing fishing boats and kidnapping fishermen in the Zhejiang sea. According to preliminary statistics from October 1st to 13th, more than 80 fishermen have been kidnapped by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops along the coast of Zhejiang.
    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit navy's piratical activities of shelling and intercepting fishing boats have aroused great resentment among the fishermen along the coast of Zhejiang. After Xu Xiaodan's husband and son were劫走by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, she said with grief and愤恨: "I will do my best to support the Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands as soon as possible, and rescue my loved ones!" After fisherman Lin Fushun's uncle was抓去by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, he joined the fishery production cooperative, and he expressed that he would work hard to produce and support the front line.

    解放军猛烈打击窜扰浙江沿海的蒋贼军
    蒋贼海军不断在浙江海面劫夺渔船并绑架渔民八十多人
      【新华社浙江前线二十五日电】在美国侵略者指使下，蒋贼军继续窜扰浙江沿海地区。
    十日十九时十五分，蒋贼军舰和炮艇各一艘，向我头门山岛炮击三十二发。我人民解放军当即猛烈还击，将这两艘蒋贼舰艇击退。十五日蒋贼军舰炮艇先后向我在凉帽屿附近捕鱼的渔民炮击二百四十多发，守卫在某岛屿的我军炮兵立即发炮还击，掩护渔民转移到安全地区。二十一日二时零五分，蒋贼军舰两艘向我田岙岛炮击一百四十发，同时向我头门山岛发炮一百零三发。十八日十一时四十八分，蒋贼RT—三三型喷气侦察机一架，曾侵入浙江省奉化、宁波等地进行骚扰。我人民解放军空军起飞截击，蒋贼飞机向外海逃去。
    十月二日一时盘踞在一江山岛上的蒋贼军，曾派遣一股武装特务潜行登上田岙岛西南高地。这一股武装特务立即遭到我守岛部队的打击，被击伤数人后狼狈逃跑。我军缴获美制手枪一支、刺刀一把。
    【新华社浙江前线二十三日电】浙江前线我海防部队击溃了登陆蒋贼军一个加强排。
    二十二日晨五时五十分，盘据在浙东南箕山岛上的蒋贼军，在两艘军舰和一艘炮艇掩护下，以一个加强排六十余人分乘五只帆船向我浙东韭菜园（平阳县境）一带沿海地区进行登陆骚扰。蒋贼军第一只帆船十五人首先在官山西南紧靠大陆的老鹰礁登岸，接着改乘舢舨到韭菜园登陆。守卫在韭菜园地区的我人民解放军海防部队在蒋贼军刚登上陆地时，就以沉着而勇猛的动作向蒋贼军突然开火和出击，一举将登陆之蒋贼军全部击溃，当场活捉蒋贼军三名。后面四只帆船上的蒋贼军见势不妙，慌忙调头逃回南箕山。
    前来掩护登陆的两艘蒋贼军舰曾向我沿海大陆发射炮弹二百多发，打伤当地居民一人，毁民房十余间。
    据新华社浙江前线二十五日电：最近蒋贼海军不断在浙江海面劫夺渔船，绑架渔民。据十月一日到十三日的初步统计，浙江沿海被蒋贼军绑架的渔民有八十多人。
    蒋贼海军炮击和拦劫渔船的海盗活动，激起了浙江沿海渔民的极大愤恨。徐小丹的丈夫和儿子被蒋贼军劫走后，她悲愤地说：“我要尽自己的力量来支援解放军早日解放台湾和沿海岛屿，救出自己的亲人！”渔民林福顺在他的叔父被蒋贼军抓去后，就参加了渔业生产合作社，他表示要努力生产，支援前线。
