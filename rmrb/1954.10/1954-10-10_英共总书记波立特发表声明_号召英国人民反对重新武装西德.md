Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th. TASS reported from London on the 7th: The General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, issued a statement on the 7th, calling on the British people to make the greatest efforts to prevent the realization of the plan to rearm West Germany.

The statement said: "The greatest test in the struggle to prevent the rearmament of Germany has arrived. Eden and Dulles have already reached an agreement at the Nine-Power Conference in London on their plan to rearm German militarism. They want Adenauer to establish an army of 500,000 men from the very beginning, to give him the power to manufacture tanks, artillery, airplanes, and submarines, and to pull him into the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization. These proposals are a betrayal of Britain, an insult to the victims of our country in the two world wars, and a threat to world peace. But these proposals have not yet become a reality. They must wait until the British Parliament and the parliaments of Western European countries have approved them before they can be implemented."

The statement said: "At this critical moment, the responsibility of the British people is very clear. They must take action to make Parliament reject the London Agreement, must make Parliament oppose any form of German rearmament, and demand new negotiations with the Soviet Union to establish European security and a peaceful and unified Germany. Let those who fought resolutely at the Brighton Trade Union Congress and the Scarborough Labour Party Conference, and all peace advocates continue this struggle! Resolutions should be submitted to Downing Street one after another, rejecting the London Agreement, and delegations should be sent immediately to visit every member of parliament, demanding that they vote against the rearmament of Germany."

The statement said: "We call on all working-class organizations and peace organizations to designate October 23 as a national demonstration day against the rearmament of Germany. Marches should be organized in all towns and villages in Britain on that day. All good men and women should unite and send representatives to participate in the World Security Conference convened by the British Peace Committee in London on October 31, and make this conference a powerful demonstration of the British people's opposition to the rearmament of Germany. Time is short. It is urgent to take action. The rearmament of Germany must not be allowed."

    英共总书记波立特发表声明
    号召英国人民反对重新武装西德
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社伦敦八日讯：英国共产党总书记波立特七日发表声明，号召英国人民作最大努力，防止实现重新武装西德的计划。
    声明说：“防止重新武装德国的斗争的最大考验时候到来了。艾登和杜勒斯已经在伦敦九国会议就他们的重新武装德国军国主义的计划取得了协议。他们要让阿登纳在一开头就建立一支五十万人的军队，给予他制造坦克、大炮、飞机与潜水艇的权力，并把他拉进侵略性的北大西洋公约。这些建议是对英国的出卖、对我国在两次大战中的死难者的污辱、对世界和平的威胁。但是这些建议还没有成为现实。它们必须等到英国议会以及西欧各国议会批准之后，才能付诸实施。”
    声明说：“在这个紧急关头，英国人民的责任是很清楚的。他们必须采取行动来使议会拒绝伦敦协议，必须使议会反对任何形式的德国的重新武装，并要求和苏联进行新的谈判，来建立欧洲安全以及一个和平统一的德国。让那些在布莱顿职工大会以及斯卡巴罗工党会议上坚决斗争的人、所有和平拥护者继续进行这场斗争吧！应该纷纷向唐宁街提出决议，拒绝伦敦协议，应该立即派遣代表团去访问每一个议员，要求他投票反对重新武装德国。”
    声明说：“我们号召所有工人阶级组织与和平组织把十月二十三日订为反对重新武装德国的全国示威日。英国各城镇和各村庄，都应该在那一天组织游行。一切善良的男女应该团结起来，派遣代表参加英国和平委员会十月三十一日在伦敦召集的世界安全大会，并使这次大会成为英国人民反对重新武装德国的强有力的示威。时间很短促了。迫切需要行动起来。决不能让德国重新武装。”
