    Further Consolidate Labor Discipline
    ——Summary of Records from the Symposium of Industrial Labor Models
    On September 29th, this newspaper invited eighteen industrial labor models who were representatives to the National People's Congress to a symposium on the issue of consolidating labor discipline. The participants of this symposium included: Wang Wenshan (Workshop Director of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory), Wang Chonglun (Planer of Tool Workshop, Anshan Iron and Steel Works Machinery General Factory), Zhu Zaodi (female, Spinning Worker of Wuhan Public-Private Joint Venture Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill), Li Chuanjiang (Workshop Director of Siping Oil and Wine Factory, Liaoning Local State-Owned Enterprise), Fan Yong (Chairman of Railway Workers' Union Changchun Sub-district Union), Meng Tai (Director of Repair Shop, Anshan Iron and Steel Works Ironmaking Plant), Meng Tianlu (Instructor of State-Owned Northwest No. 4 Cotton Mill), Gao Fengqin (female, Member of the Family Committee of the Trade Union of Shenyang 52 Factory), Zhang Zifu (Vice Chairman of Fushun Mining Area Trade Union of Coal Miners' Union), Guo Qingsi (Worker of Pingxiang Coal Mine), Guo Menghe (Captain of Yumen Oil Mine Drilling Team), Guo Xiuyun (female, former Long-Distance Telephone Operator of Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau), Zeng Wenchang (Duty Director of Gejiu Tin Mine), Yi Shijuan (female, Group Leader of Spinning Workshop, State-Owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill), Yang Yiping (Deputy Director of Sichuan Cement Plant), Liu Jiuxue (Captain of Coal Mining Team, Lifeng Coal Mine, Jiaozuo Mining Bureau), Liu Changfu (Director of New Wire Rod Workshop, No. 4 Branch Factory, Tianjin Steel Plant), Liu Dezhen (Technician of Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant).
    Based on the records of the symposium, the representatives' speeches are divided into several issues and summarized as follows:
  Further Consolidating Labor Discipline is a Current
    Important Task
    Meng Tai pointed out in his speech: As the workers' consciousness continues to increase, there are more and more people who actively work and want to improve production, and fewer and fewer people who violate labor discipline. However, there are still people who do not work hard, use various excuses to not go to work, and do not work according to the rules. Some workers in the repair shop of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Ironmaking Plant said before entering the factory that as long as they were allowed to enter the factory, they would definitely work hard; but after working for not long, they complained about low wages and poor positions, and started making trouble.
    Yang Yiping said: Some workers at Sichuan Cement Plant collude with each other, and those who are working help those who are not working to secretly stamp the attendance cards. Some workers deliberately wear sunglasses and sleep while working, and when others find out, they claim that their eyes hurt. Some workers drink alcohol at work, get drunk, and end up damaging the machinery or causing personal accidents. Last year, the cement plant failed to complete the state plan, and lax labor discipline was an important reason.
    Liu Changfu said: Tianjin Steel Plant also has similar situations. Some workers feign illness; some are absent from work and slack off for a long time under various pretexts; a transferred worker has been staying in a sanatorium all year round, and repeated education has not changed him, and he has not been dealt with until now.
    Guo Xiuyun said: One of the most important problems in telecommunications enterprises today is that there are many errors in work. Once an error occurs, it cannot be recovered, causing serious consequences. One recorder is a "mistake king," mainly because she is not dedicated to her work and often goes out to sing. The phenomenon of not being dedicated to work is relatively common in telecommunications enterprises. They believe that telecommunications work has no future, etc., which is actually an insufficient understanding of the significance of labor.
    Yi Shijuan said: In textile female workers, there is also a situation of lax labor discipline. Some female workers in State-Owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill read comic books while producing; those on the night shift do not rest during the day, but go to see plays, and sleep when they are on duty at night; some think of dancing as soon as it is Saturday and do not produce well; one female worker had her finger crushed because she was talking to someone while working.
    While citing the current phenomenon of lax labor discipline, many representatives unanimously emphasized that labor discipline must be further consolidated. Taking Tianjin Steel Plant as an example, Liu Changfu said: Most of their factory's production is automated. The higher the degree of automation, the more it requires workers to have good discipline. For example, the wire rod produced by the plant has to pass through the hands of dozens of people, and if one worker does not work well, production will be affected. Zeng Wenchang also said: Since liberation, the attendance rate of workers at Gejiu Tin Mine in Yunnan has been continuously increasing, often exceeding the national target. However, the phenomenon of lax labor discipline still exists. If this situation is not corrected, production will often be affected.
  The Work of Strengthening Labor Discipline Should Be Regularized
    The main way to consolidate labor discipline should be to strengthen education. Representatives criticized some enterprises and units for not being regular and not paying attention to the education of labor discipline. Guo Xiuyun said: Telecommunications enterprises do not do enough labor education work. Errors always come first, and education comes later. Leading cadres only pay attention to statistics on errors, but do not pay attention to strengthening labor discipline to eliminate errors.
    Zeng Wenchang gave an example: After liberation, the lives of workers at Gejiu Tin Mine were greatly improved. The thinking of some workers has changed. They only seek enjoyment and do not want to work. Later, the leading cadres explained the harm of violating labor discipline to the country to the workers by calculating detailed accounts, and the workers were greatly alerted; then, they used typical demonstrations to invite a worker who became an advanced worker after changing his work attitude to give a report, and the effect was very good. However, this work still needs to be carried out regularly in the future.
    Yang Yiping said: Their factory's labor discipline education is not regular, and they still use the old method of "rushing for a while." When an accident occurs, they "rush for a while," and it is over in the blink of an eye.
    What kind of education should be strengthened in strengthening labor discipline? Fan Yong proposed that attention should be paid to educating workers on new moral qualities and labor concepts. In the past, talking about socialism meant talking about how happy and fulfilling it would be, but little was said about establishing a socialist labor attitude as the first step in building socialism. Workers should learn from the spirit of Soviet workers in strictly observing labor discipline.
    Liu Changfu proposed: Comrades' trial meetings are also a good way to conduct labor discipline education. Their factory once used this method to deal with three workers who violated labor discipline. The workers themselves judged them, which gave all the workers a great education.
  Those Who Seriously Violate Discipline Should Be
      Seriously Dealt With
    Consolidating labor discipline also requires establishing strict internal discipline and imposing sanctions on a small number of serious violators of labor discipline in accordance with the law. Zhang Zifu cited the example of Fushun Coal Mine: There were two workers, two brothers, who both feigned illness and were absent from work for a long time. They took medicine water from the medical clinic and poured it out after leaving the clinic. After asking for sick leave, they went to small restaurants to drink or to play with women. When trade union cadres visited their homes, they deliberately pretended to be sick. One worked only four days in eight months, and when others criticized him, he said, "You go to work and get paid, and I get paid even if I don't go to work." The Party and the administration repeatedly educated them, but they still did not change. Such people should be resolutely disciplined.
    Li Chuanjiang also said: Three workers in Siping Oil and Wine Factory had long-term emotional problems, "making big mistakes but constantly making small mistakes," scolding workers and destroying machinery. Later, the administration sent the three workers to the court to be dealt with according to law, and the workers were very satisfied. Therefore, those who observe labor discipline well should be commended, and those who do wrong must be strictly punished, and there should be no sloppiness, so that the masses of workers can be mobilized.
    Yang Yiping said: Strict enforcement of discipline is extremely necessary. He gave an example: The problem of workers drinking alcohol at work at Sichuan Cement Plant has not been resolved for a long time, and they often cause trouble. One worker drowned in the water because he was drunk. Later, the leaders announced that drinking alcohol was not allowed during working hours, and those who had drunk alcohol were not allowed to take over the shift. Some workers resisted this decision, saying, "I can go without food, but I must drink alcohol." The leaders then announced the suspension of his work. Due to the firm enforcement of discipline, the phenomenon of drinking alcohol during working hours has been basically eliminated since then.
  Seriously Implement Operating Procedures and Strengthen
    Education of Young Workers
    The most prominent and serious violations of labor discipline at present are violations of operating procedures and safety procedures. Equipment and personal accidents occur almost universally and constantly in enterprises.
    Wang Wenshan carefully analyzed and said: The main reason for the continuous occurrence of accidents in enterprises is the low technical level. In the past, relatively simple machines were used. Now, very complex Soviet-style machine tools are used. It is important to know when to apply which oil. New workers go to work before they have learned the operating procedures. Generally, they only know how to use them but not how to maintain them, just like people who ride horses do not know how to raise horses. Some operating procedures are formulated by a few people sitting in the office. They neither listened to the opinions of the workers before formulating them, nor did they implement them well after formulating them. Some workers do not know them at all. The situation of workers not cherishing machinery and equipment is also serious. Some workers do not take good care of the machines. They believe that they are only responsible for completing the plan, and wiping the machines is the apprentice's job. They work hard when they are on duty, and when they get off work, the lathes are full of iron filings, and they just leave. As a result, equipment is often damaged, causing accidents.
    Liu Dezhen also pointed out: Implementing operating procedures is the most important thing in consolidating labor discipline at present. However, when implementing operating procedures, it is necessary to simultaneously organize everyone to learn technology and improve their technical level. Some workers can recite the operating procedures very well, but their technology is poor. When problems occur, they panic, and they forget the procedures, which can lead to accidents.
    Several representatives especially mentioned: At present, it is particularly necessary to strengthen the education of young workers in consolidating labor discipline. Fan Yong and Gao Fengqin both said: There are more problems among young workers who have recently joined the factory. They complain about the hard life, low wages, and spend money indiscriminately, and their discipline is poor. Liu Dezhen also said: Young workers have poor skills, but they are not afraid like "newborn calves." They work blindly, which often causes problems. Some young people who have just come from school think that they have a high level of education, look down on workers, and are unwilling to learn humbly. This shows that it is very necessary to implement labor education in school education.
  Improve Management and Solve the Problems of the Masses
      Difficulty
    Almost all attendees stated: To consolidate labor discipline, enterprise leaders must improve enterprise management, go deep into the masses, overcome bureaucratic work styles, and care about the work and lives of employees. The situation of too many meetings and too many non-production activities in enterprises is still very serious, which increases the fatigue of employees.
    Zhang Zifu said: It is often dozens of miles from the mine shaft to the mining bureau. If the superior makes a phone call and asks to hold a meeting, they have to rush there. Many workers in Fushun live more than forty miles away from the mine. It takes an hour and a half to take the tram. If the meeting is held late at night, they cannot sleep when they go back, and they have no energy to work the next day.
    Wang Chonglun and Fan Yong both pointed out that there are still too many meetings in enterprises, and there are still too many social activities for labor models. Models have become "trouble" and are very distressed.
    Meng Tianlu said: As long as you are determined, meetings can be streamlined. Our factory now has strict regulations on the time and number of meetings, which are not allowed to be exceeded. Labor models do not hold concurrent positions. Now I only serve as the trade union group leader, and I do not hold other positions concurrently, so the work is much better.
    Yang Yiping also said: In the past, I held more than a dozen positions concurrently and was busy with meetings all day long. Now the factory is learning from the method of Factory 101, and the Party committee uniformly controls and arranges meetings. Meetings are not allowed to be held casually, and meetings must be approved by the Party committee. In this way, the chaotic phenomenon of too many meetings has been basically overcome.
    Some unreasonable living systems should also be improved. Fan Yong cited an example of annual leave: Many employees of Harbin Railway have not been home for several years. The leaders allow them to go home on annual leave every year, but they do not implement it every year during the New Year, always saying that the production task is busy, dragging on year after year. Last year, during the New Year, many workers simply went home automatically. This action is of course not good and violates labor discipline. Workers should not do this; but it also shows that the implementation of the annual leave system really needs to be improved.
    Yang Yiping said: Violation of labor discipline is also related to uneven production. The factory is often unhurried at the beginning of the month, and when the task is tight at the end of the month, it does everything possible to work desperately, and labor discipline is thrown to the back of their minds. Some workshop directors and other leading cadres themselves do not pay attention to labor discipline. Meng Tianlu reflected that the phenomenon of administrative management personnel of State-Owned Northwest No. 4 Cotton Mill violating labor discipline is quite common. The workers have a lot of opinions, saying, "It is too unfair to only ask workers to abide by it." It can be seen that the exemplary role of leaders at all levels is very important.
  Doing a Good Job in Family Work is Very Important for Consolidating Labor Discipline
    Great Effect
    Doing a good job in the families of employees so that workers can lead united and harmonious family lives has a significant effect on consolidating labor discipline.
    Zhang Zifu told a vivid story at the meeting: There is a worker's family in their mine, a family of three, with a monthly wage income of more than 600 points, which should be good, but the woman does not know how to manage the family, and she eats and drinks well. Every month, the money is not enough, and the couple often quarrels, and the worker is very distressed and does not work hard. Many workers are affected by family disharmony, and one worker once fought with his wife, gambled and worked in a fit of anger, and as a result, an accident occurred and he unfortunately sacrificed himself. Later, the trade union organized some of the workers' family members to visit the mine, and they were deeply moved when they saw the arduous conditions of labor in the mine. The woman who ate and drank well actually cried at the symposium, expressing her determination to correct her past shortcomings. Since then, she has arranged her housework very well, life is better than before, and there is also a monthly surplus. The husband and wife are harmonious, and the workers work hard. One worker also applied to join the Party. It can be seen that doing a good job in family work is very important.
    Gao Fengqin, a model of family work in the Northeast, pointed out: At present, the family work of many factories and mines has stalled, and this situation must be corrected. She suggested that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions strengthen its leadership over the work of the families of employees. The leaders of factories and mining enterprises should pay attention to it. Newspapers should also pay attention to publicity and reports in this regard. She said: In recent years, many new workers have been added to the factory, adding many new family members, and there are more problems among them. When the man gets off work, she asks him to dig the ground, plant vegetables, and do other housework, not allowing him to get adequate rest. Newcomers inevitably have some difficulties in life, and they quarrel and complain. Our family committee later stepped up education for them and helped them solve their difficulties. For example, some felt it was inconvenient to have children, so we trained our own midwives and helped them solve the difficulties of buying firewood and rice, so that everyone truly felt that the factory was their own home, and the situation was much better afterwards.

    进一步巩固劳动纪律
    ——工业劳动模范座谈会记录摘要
    九月二十九日，本报邀请全国人民代表大会代表中的工业劳动模范十八人，座谈关于巩固劳动纪律问题。参加这次座谈会的有：王文山（沈阳第一机床厂车间主任）、王崇伦（鞍钢机械总厂工具车间刨工）、朱早弟（女，武汉公私合营武昌第一纱厂细纱值车女工）、李川江（辽宁地方国营四平油酒厂车间主任）、范永（铁路工会长春分区工会主席）、孟泰（鞍钢炼铁厂修理场场长）、孟天禄（国营西北第四棉纺织厂指导工）、高凤琴（女，沈阳五二工厂工会家属委员会委员）、张子富（煤矿工会抚顺矿区工会副主席）、郭清泗（萍乡煤矿工人）、郭孟和（玉门油矿钻探队队长）、郭秀云（女，原天津电信局长途电话话务员）、曾文昌（个旧锡矿值班主任）、裔式娟（女，国营上海第二棉纺织厂细纱车间小组长）、杨义平（四川水泥厂副厂长）、刘九学（焦作矿务局李封煤矿采煤队队长）、刘长福（天津钢厂四分厂新盘条车间主任）、刘德珍（北京石景山发电厂技师）。
    根据座谈会的记录，把代表们的发言分成几个问题摘要发表如下：
  进一步巩固劳动纪律是当前的
    重要任务
    孟泰在发言中指出：随着工人们的觉悟的不断提高，积极干活、要把生产搞好的人是越来越多，违反劳动纪律的人是越来越少了。但是，工作不努力，用各种借口不上工，以及不按规矩干活的人还是有的。鞍钢炼铁厂修理场某些工人在没有进厂以前说，只要让他进厂，他一定好好干活；但进厂后没有作多久工，就嫌工资低，嫌位置不好，闹起事来了。
    杨义平说：四川水泥厂有的工人相互串通，上班的人帮没上班的人偷盖上班图章，有的工人在工作时故意戴上黑眼镜睡觉，别人发现了就推说是眼睛痛。有的工人上班喝酒，喝得醺醺大醉，结果损坏机器，或者造成人身事故。去年水泥厂未完成国家计划，劳动纪律松弛是重要原因之一。
    刘长福说：天津钢厂也有类似情形。有的工人没病装病；有的长期借故旷工怠工；有个转业工人整年住疗养院，屡次教育不见改正，一直拖到现在还没有处理。
    郭秀云说：电信企业当前最主要的问题之一是工作中差错多，一出差错就没法挽回，造成严重后果。有一个记录员是“差错大王”，主要原因是她不安心工作，经常出外演唱。不安心工作现象在电信企业中是比较普遍的，他们认为电信工作没有前途等等，实际上是对劳动的意义认识不足。
    裔式娟说：在纺织女工中也同样有劳动纪律松弛的情况。国营上海第二棉纺织厂有的女工一面生产，一面看连环画；值晚班的白天不休息，跑去看戏，晚上值班时就睡觉；有的一到星期六就想着跳舞，不好好生产；有一个女工就因为一面和人谈话，一面做活，结果手指头给轧掉了。
    许多代表在举出目前劳动纪律松弛的现象的同时，一致强调必须进一步巩固劳动纪律。刘长福以天津钢厂为例说：他们厂的生产大部分都自动化了，自动化程度越高，就越要求工人有良好的纪律。例如该厂生产的盘条，要经过几十个人的手，一个工人不好好干活，就会使生产受到损失。曾文昌也说：解放以后，云南个旧锡矿工人的出勤率不断提高，经常超过国家规定的指标。但是劳动纪律松懈的现象也仍然存在，如果不纠正这种情况，就会使生产经常受到损失。
  加强劳动纪律的工作要经常化
    巩固劳动纪律主要应当加强教育。代表们批评某些企业单位对劳动纪律的教育不经常，不重视。郭秀云说：电信企业劳动教育工作做得不够，总是差错在先，教育在后。领导干部只注意统计差错，而不注意加强劳动纪律消灭差错。
    曾文昌举例说：个旧锡矿工人解放后生活大大改善了，有的工人思想发生了变化，只图享受，不想劳动了。后来领导干部通过算细账的方法向工人们说明违反劳动纪律对于国家的危害，工人们都大为警惕；以后又用典型示范的方法，请一个劳动态度转变后成了先进工作者的工人作报告，效果很好。但是这些工作今后还需要经常进行。
    杨义平说：他们厂的劳动纪律教育不经常，还是采取“轰一阵”的旧法子，出事故就“轰一阵”，转眼也就过去了。
    加强劳动纪律应该作些什么教育呢，范永提出要注意对工人进行新道德品质和劳动观念的教育。过去谈社会主义就是讲如何美满幸福，很少讲建设社会主义首先要树立社会主义的劳动态度。工人们应当学习苏联工人严格遵守劳动纪律的精神。
    刘长福提出：同志审判会也是进行劳动纪律教育的一种好方式，他们厂曾运用这种方式处理了三个违犯劳动纪律的工人，由工人自己来审判，给全体工人很大的教育。
  对严重违反纪律的分子应当
      严肃处理
    巩固劳动纪律还必须建立起内部严格的纪律，并对少数严重违反劳动纪律者依法予以处分。张子富举出抚顺煤矿的例子说：有两个工人，是弟兄两个，都长期装病旷工，在医务所领了药水，出所就把药倒掉，请了病假后就进小酒馆喝酒，或者去玩女人。工会干部到他们家中去访问，他们又故意装病。有一个先后八个月只上了四天班，别人批评他，他说：“你们上班拿工资，我不上班也照样拿工资。”党和行政一再教育他们，他们还是不改。像这样的人就应该坚决予以纪律处分。
    李川江也说：四平油酒厂有三个工人长期闹情绪，“大错不犯，小错不断”，打骂工人，破坏机器，后来行政上把三个工人送法院依法处理，工人们很是满意。所以，对遵守劳动纪律好的要表扬，坏的一定要严格处分，不能马虎，这样工人群众才能发动起来。
    杨义平说：严格执行纪律是极有必要的。他举了个例子：四川水泥厂工人上班喝酒问题长期未解决，经常闹事，有个工人因为喝醉酒掉在水里淹死了。以后领导上宣布工作时不准喝酒，喝过酒的不准接班，有的工人抗拒这个决定，说“我饭不吃可以，酒非喝不可。”领导上便宣布停止他的工作。由于坚决执行纪律，工作时间喝酒的现象从此基本消除了。
  认真贯彻操作规程，加强
    青年工人的教育
    违反劳动纪律目前最突出最严重的，是违反操作规程和安全规程，企业中几乎普遍地不断发生设备和人身事故。
    王文山仔细地作了分析说：企业中不断发生事故，主要原因是技术水平低，过去使用的都是比较简单的机器，现在使用的是很复杂的苏式机床，什么时候上什么油都得有学问。新工人们还未学会操作规程就上班了，一般只会用不会维护，就好像骑马的人不会养马。而有些操作规程，是少数人坐在办公室里订出来的，订前既未听取工人的意见，订后也未很好贯彻下去，有的工人就完全不知道。工人中不爱护机器设备的情况也是严重的。有的工人对机器不大爱护，认为自己只管完成计划，擦洗车子是徒工的事，上班时拚命干，下班时车床上都是铁屑，就走掉了，结果就常常损坏设备，造成事故。
    刘德珍也指出：贯彻操作规程是当前巩固劳动纪律中最重要的事。但在贯彻操作规程时，一定要同时组织大家学技术，提高技术水平。有的工人操作规程背得很熟，但技术差，待发生问题时就慌了手脚，规程也忘掉了，结果就会酿成事故。
    几个代表都特别提起：目前在巩固劳动纪律中特别要加强对青年工人的教育。范永和高凤琴都说：现在入厂不久的青年工人中问题较多，嫌生活苦，工资少，又随便乱花钱，纪律不好。刘德珍也说：青工技术差，但又好比“新生的牛犊不怕虎”，干活蛮干，就常出乱子。也有些刚从学校来的青年，自以为文化水平高，瞧不起工人，不肯虚心学习。这说明了在学校教育中如何贯彻劳动教育是很有必要的。
  要改进管理工作，解决群众
      困难
    几乎所有出席的人都提出：要巩固劳动纪律，企业领导上必须改进企业管理工作，深入群众，克服官僚主义作风，关心职工的工作和生活。现在企业中会议多、非生产活动多的情况仍很严重，增加职工疲劳。
    张子富说：从矿井到矿务局常有几十里路，上级摇一个电话叫开会，就得赶去。抚顺不少工人住在离矿四十里路以外，坐电车也要一个半钟头，晚上会开晚了回去就睡不成，第二天就没劲工作。
    王崇伦、范永都提出，企业中会议仍然太多，劳动模范的社会活动仍然太多，模范变成了“麻烦”，都很苦恼。
    孟天禄说：只要下决心，会议是可以精简的，我们的厂现在对会议时间、次数作了严格规定，不准超过，劳动模范不兼职，现在我只担任工会小组长，别的职务都不兼，工作就好得多了。
    杨义平也说：过去我兼十多个职务，整天忙于开会。现在厂里学习一○一厂的办法，由党委统一掌握安排会议，不准随便开，开会要经党委批准，这样会议多的纷乱现象基本上克服了。
    不合理的某些生活制度也要加以改进。范永举了一个年假的例子：哈尔滨铁路上许多职工好几年没回家了，领导上每年允许年假让他们回家，可是年年过年时都不实行，总是说生产任务忙，一年拖
  一年，去年过年时，有许多工人就干脆自动回家去了，这种行动当然是不好的，是违反劳动纪律的，工人们不应当这样做；但是也说明年假制度的执行确实须要改进。
    杨义平说：违反劳动纪律和生产不均衡也有关系，工厂里常常月初不慌不忙，到月底任务紧了，就不顾一切的拚命干，劳动纪律早丢到了脑后。有些车间主任和其他领导干部本身就不重视劳动纪一律。孟天禄反映国营西北第四棉纺织厂行政管理人员违反劳动纪律的现象相当普遍，工人很有意见，说：“光要工人遵守，太不公平。”可见各级领导干部的模范作用是很重要的。
  做好家属工作对巩固劳动纪律
    有很大作用
    做好职工家属工作，使工人们都能过着团结和睦的家庭生活，这对巩固劳动纪律有重大作用。
    张子富在会上讲了一个生动的故事：他们矿上有一个工人家庭，一家三口人，每月工资收入有六百多分，应该说是不错了，但是女人不会管家，好吃好喝，每月钱都不够花，两口子就常常吵闹，工人很是苦恼，劳动也不带劲。不少工人因为家庭不和而影响劳动情绪，有一个工人有一次和老婆打架，赌气上班工作，结果发生事故不幸牺牲。后来，工会组织了一部分工人家属下井参观，她们在井下看到了井下劳动的艰苦情形，很受感动。那个好吃喝的女人在座谈会上竟哭了起来，表示坚决改正过去的缺点。从此她就很好地安排家务，生活比过去好过了，而且每月还有节余，夫妻和睦了，工人也就劳动得很带劲。有一个工人还提出要求入党。由此可见，做好家属工作是非常重要的。
    东北家属工作模范高凤琴指出：现在许多厂矿的家属工作都停顿了，这种情况要纠正。她建议全国总工会加强对职工家属工作的领导。厂矿企业的领导上应当重视。报纸也要注意这方面的宣传报道。她说：这几年来厂里新工人增加得很多，添了许多新家属，她们中间问题较多。男人下班了，她就要他去刨地种菜，以及其他家务劳动，不让他得到充分休息。新来时生活上不免有些困难，她们就吵架，发牢骚。我们家属委员会后来加紧对她们进行教育，帮助她们解决困难，譬如有的感到生小孩不便，我们便自己训练了接生员，还给她们解决买劈柴、买米等困难，使大家真正感到了工厂就是自己的家，以后情况就好得多了。
