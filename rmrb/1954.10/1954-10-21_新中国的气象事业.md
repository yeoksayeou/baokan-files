The Development of the Meteorological Undertaking

In the five years since the founding of New China, all aspects of natural science have achieved significant progress, and meteorological science is an important part of this.

Meteorological science is an important weapon for people to fight against nature, and it is extremely closely related to people's lives. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Kuomintang bandit gang established some meteorological stations in the pseudo-air force system and the pseudo-Central Meteorological Bureau system, but these meteorological stations were only tools for them to carry out the anti-people civil war and slaughter the Chinese people. The Kuomintang customs system also had a number of meteorological stations, but when the customs sovereignty was also in the hands of imperialism, the meteorological stations of course only directly served the imperialist merchant ships. Under such circumstances, the working people of our country have long suffered from various natural disasters, especially in coastal areas, whenever a fierce typhoon suddenly strikes, it blows down houses, uproots trees, and overturns fishing boats, causing many losses. For example, in 1922, a typhoon suddenly struck Shantou City in our country, and the sea water flooded the urban area, causing approximately 60,000 deaths and injuries in the city. This kind of sudden natural disaster also often caused huge losses to our country's agriculture and salt industry.

After the founding of New China, the state gave full attention to meteorological work, and our country's meteorological science began to achieve real development. In the past few years, the Central Meteorological Bureau and the Central Meteorological Observatory have been established successively, and a considerable number of meteorological stations and observation stations have been established throughout the country according to a certain density. Some of these stations are on plateaus with an altitude of 5,000 meters, some are in uninhabited deserts, some are on the southeast coast, and some are on the northwest border. These meteorological workers all over the country record the changes in the atmosphere at the ends of the earth every day and send them to Beijing by radio. The Central Meteorological Observatory in Beijing analyzes these observation reports and then issues forecasts of weather changes in the next 24 or 48 hours to the whole country. Local meteorological stations also make various local weather forecasts and warnings based on the observation reports broadcast centrally from Beijing. Now, these meteorological stations and observation stations have formed a vast basic meteorological network.

Serving Economic Construction and People's Lives

Our country's young meteorological science undertaking has begun to become an effective tool for our people to fight against natural disasters in the past few years. Now, when the cold air from Siberia begins to move south, or when a typhoon in the Pacific Ocean is about to strike, people can hear warnings issued by meteorological workers from all over the country. These weather forecasts have enabled people to avoid many weather disasters. At 9:30 p.m. on September 16, 1953, No. 1 wind signal was hoisted at Guanghai Port in Taishan County on the southern coast of our country. This was a typhoon warning issued by the meteorological station to the fishermen along the coast. When the fishermen saw the wind signal, they sailed their fishing boats into the typhoon shelter one after another, and the residents living near the coast also moved to safe areas. The prior preventive work helped people to safely survive the terrible rainstorm. In the past few years, weather forecasts have also reduced the losses of some natural disasters to agricultural production. On October 9, 1952, the weather in Hebei and its vicinity was unusually clear. Suddenly, the Central Meteorological Observatory issued a message that a cold wave would hit our country. This message was immediately spread to the vast rural areas, and the farmers immediately began to rush to harvest the peanuts that had matured and to settle other crops. At noon on the 10th, layers of dark clouds surged in the sky, and a cold wind blew with cold rain. On the 11th, the temperature dropped sharply, and on the 12th, it froze, but the farmers did not suffer any losses.

In the Mongolian grasslands and remote areas, weather forecasts are of greater significance. In the past, once a blizzard struck, thousands of cattle and sheep would be frozen to death. Now, each league and banner in Inner Mongolia has established a special radio station to listen to weather forecasts. Whenever the meteorological station reports that a cold wave is about to strike, people ride fast horses to various tents to tell the herders to prepare enough fodder and take good care of the lambs to prevent the invasion of various natural disasters.

Weather forecasts have a significant impact on sea salt production, because sea salt production relies on sunlight to evaporate. If it rains, the crystallized salt particles will be washed away by the rain. If a strong wind and rainstorm pass through, it will even cause the serious consequences of dike collapse and field destruction. Thanks to the establishment of meteorological forecasting stations in my country's major salt farms in recent years, the salt farmers have received valuable assistance from meteorological scientists and have begun to get rid of the intrusion of natural disasters.

Hardworking "Meteorological Sentinels"

The work of meteorological workers is extremely arduous. Many of the meteorological stations newly built in our country in the past few years are located in places with abnormally harsh climatic conditions, remote transportation, and sparsely populated areas. For example, the Huashan Meteorological Station is located on the top of a mountain with an altitude of more than 2,000 meters. There are many thunderstorms in summer and the freezing period is very long in winter. Storms often break the antennas, and the staff of the meteorological station must overcome these difficulties at the risk of danger. The Markang Meteorological Station, far away on the frontier, is located on a deserted grassland, where even a small house to live in cannot be found. The staff of the meteorological station have been here for more than a year, but they have been living in tents all the time. When the storm strikes, it rains outside the tent, and it also rains inside the tent, and even the oil lamp cannot be lit. At this time, the comrades have to hide under the table to record the weather changes. On the harsh climate of the Kangzang Plateau, our meteorological staff, like the People's Liberation Army advancing into Tibet, have experienced all kinds of hardships. In a certain season in 1951, a team of meteorological staff, carrying instruments with them, set off for the Xikang area along the forward road of the People's Liberation Army advancing into Kangzang. They passed through the primeval forests where the sun could not be seen, and stepped over the deserted mountains and snowy fields where no people could be seen. The heavy meteorological instruments pressed their shoulders swollen, and the long journey made the comrades' feet lame, but everyone said in unison: "As long as our feet can still walk, we will carry the instruments to the frontier. For the construction of the motherland and for the happiness of the people, what does it matter if we suffer a little!"

The hardships of the meteorological workers who work in the high mountains and wild lands all year round are difficult for ordinary people to imagine. For example, the comrades working at the Qilian Mountain Meteorological Station have to climb 90 miles of rugged mountain roads to buy daily necessities. The Emei Mountain Station is blocked by heavy snow in the mountains for five months of the year, and they are almost completely cut off from the outside world. The meteorological station in a certain place in Northeast China also has to be constantly on guard against wild animal attacks. Most of the comrades working in these stations are very young. They deal with the floating clouds, blowing winds, and falling rain all year round, but the scientific sentinels, encouraged by the enthusiasm for building the motherland, work tenaciously, and they live very healthily and happily. The Hengshan Meteorological Station on Mount Zhurong Peak in Nanyue is more than 1,300 meters above sea level, and it is frozen for six months of the year; the temperature is below minus ten degrees, and it takes sixty miles back and forth to buy daily necessities. There are a total of ten people in the whole station, six of whom are members of the Communist Youth League. They regard fighting against hardships as their greatest glory. On the door of the house, they wrote such a couplet: "Hardship is glory, confidence is strength." In the meritorious service campaign, the comrades all submitted plans to the Party branch, wanting to strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.

With the development of the motherland's economic construction, in the next few years, new mines will be developed, new hydropower stations will be built, new cities will be built... These all require meteorological workers to provide them with more information. This is a glorious and arduous task, and people expect the meteorological workers of the motherland to make greater achievements.

    气象事业的发展
    新中国成立五年来，自然科学的各方面都获得了显著的进展，气象科学工作就是其中的一个重要方面。
    气象科学是人们与自然进行斗争的重要武器，它与人民生活有着极为密切的关系。在国民党反动统治时期，国民党匪帮曾在伪空军系统中及伪中央气象局系统中建立了一些气象站，但是这些气象站只是他们进行反人民的内战，屠杀中国人民的工具。在国民党海关系统中也设有若干气象站，当海关主权也在帝国主义掌握中的时候，气象台当然也只是直接为帝国主义的商船服务的。在这种情况下，我国劳动人民长期以来饱受了各种自然灾害的痛苦，特别是在沿海地区，每当猛烈的台风突然袭来时，就刮倒房屋，拔起树木，掀翻渔船，造成了许多损失。例如一九二二年，台风突然侵袭了我国的汕头市，海水淹没了市区，全市死伤了约六万人。这种突然袭来的自然灾害，同样的也使我国的农业和盐业常常遭受浩大的损失。
    新中国成立后，国家对气象工作给予了充分的重视，我国的气象科学才开始获得了真正的发展。几年来，先后成立了中央气象局和中央气象台，并在全国各地，按照一定的密度，建立了相当数量的气象台和观测站，这些台站有的是在海拔五千公尺的高原上，有的是在渺无人烟的沙漠中，有的在东南的海岸，有的在西北的边疆上。这些遍布各地的气象工作者，每天都将祖国天涯海角大气的变化状况记载下来，用无线电送到北京；北京的中央气象台根据这些观测情报，加以分析，再向全国发出今后二十四小时或四十八小时内的天气变化情况的预测。各地气象台也根据北京集中广播的观测情报，做出当地的各种天气预报警报。现在，这些气象台和观测站已经形成了一个广大的基本气象网。
    为经济建设和人民生活服务
    我国年轻的气象科学事业，几年来已经开始成为我国人民与自然灾害作斗争的一个有效的工具。现在，当西伯利亚的寒流开始南下，或者太平洋上的台风将要袭来的时候，人们就可以听到气象工作者自各地发出的警报。这些气象预报使得人们避免了不少次天气灾害的侵袭。一九五三年九月十六日晚上九时三十分，在我国南海岸台山县的广海港挂起了一号风球，这是气象站向沿海的渔民们发出了台风警报。渔民们看到风球，就纷纷把渔船驶进避风港口，居住在海岸附近的居民也都搬到安全区去。事先的预防工作，帮助人们从可怕的暴风雨中安然度过。几年来，气象预报也使农业生产减免了一些自然灾害的损失。一九五二年十月九日，河北一带天气异常晴朗，突然中央气象台发布了寒潮袭击我国的消息。这个消息立刻传到广大乡村，农民们随即开始抢收已经成熟了的花生，安顿好其他庄稼。到了十日中午，天边涌上了层层黑云，刮起了寒风，下起了冷雨，十一日气温就直线下降，十二日就结了冻，但农民们却没有受到损失。
    在蒙古草原上和边远地区，气象预报更有重大意义。过去一旦暴风雪压来，数以千计的牛羊就会活活冻死。现在，内蒙古每个盟旗都已建立了收听天气预报的专用电台，每当气象台报告寒潮将袭来时，人们就骑着快马，驰往各个帐篷，关照牧民们备足草料，看管好羊羔。预防各种自然灾害的侵袭。
    天气预报对海盐的生产有着重大影响，因为海盐生产是靠太阳光来蒸发的，如果下雨就会使已经结晶的盐粒随雨水流掉，如果遇上强风暴雨过境，甚至会造成海堤崩溃、场滩全毁的严重后果。由于几年来在我国各主要盐场都设立了气象预报站，盐民们获得了气象科学工作者宝贵的帮助，开始摆脱了自然灾害的侵袭。
    艰苦工作的“气象哨兵”
    气象工作者的劳动，是极为艰苦的。几年来我国新建起来的气象站，有许多是在气候条件异常恶劣、交通偏僻和人烟稀少的地方。如华山气象站是设在海拔二千多公尺的山顶上，夏季多雷雨，冬季封冻的时间很长，暴风雨经常吹断天线，气象站的工作人员就必须冒着危险战胜这些困难。远在边疆的马尔康气象站设在一个荒漠的草原上，这里甚至于找不到一个可以栖身的小屋，气象站的工作人员到达此地已经一年多了，但他们还一直住在帐篷里。当暴风雨袭来时，帐篷外面下雨，帐篷里面也下雨，连油灯也点不着，这时，同志们就只好躲到桌子底下将天气变化的情况记载下来。在气候恶劣的康藏高原上，我们的气象工作人员如同进军西藏的人民解放军一样，历尽了种种艰难困苦。一九五一年某季一队气象工作人员，随身携带着仪器，沿着进军康藏的人民解放军的前进道路向西康地区进发，他们经过了抬头不见天日的原始森林，踏过了不见人烟的荒山雪地，沉重的气象仪器把他们的肩膀压肿了，遥远的路程使同志们的脚走跛了，但大家都异口同声地说：“只要我们的脚还能走路，我们就抬着仪器走到边疆，为了建设祖国，为了人民的幸福，吃一些苦又算得了什么！”
    终年在高山野地上工作着的气象工作者，他们生活的艰难困苦是一般人所很难想像的。例如在祁连山气象站工作的同志，要爬九十里崎岖的山路才可以买到日用品。峨嵋山站一年内有五个月是被大雪封在山里，他们和外界几乎完全断绝了联系。在东北某地的气象站，还要经常预防野兽的袭击。在这些站内工作的同志们，大都很年轻，他们终年和飘来的云，刮来的风，落下来的雨打交道，但是为建设祖国的热情所鼓舞的科学哨兵们，顽强地劳动着，他们生活得十分健康和愉快。在南岳祝融峰上的衡山气象站，拔海一千三百多公尺，每年有六个月是冰冻期间；气温是在零下十度，生活必需品须要往返六十里路才能买到。全站共有十个人，其中有六个是青年团员，他们把跟艰苦作斗争作为自己最大的光荣，在房屋的大门上，他们写了这样一付对联：“艰苦就是光荣，信心就是力量”。在立功运动中，同志们都向党支部提出了计划，要争取做一个光荣的共产党员。
    随着祖国经济建设的发展，在今后若干年内，新的矿山将要开发起来，新的水力发电站将要建立起来，新的城市要建设起来……这些都要气象工作者为他们提供更多的资料，这是一个光荣而又艰巨的任务，人们期待着祖国气象工作者能做出更大的成绩来。
