Primary markets in the flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province have recovered. In many market towns and other primary markets, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have launched busy supply and purchasing operations, and most private retailers have also resumed business. The disaster-stricken people buy large quantities of means of production and consumer goods from here every day, and at the same time sell large quantities of sideline products such as fresh fish.

Before the floodwaters receded, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives actively investigated the needs of the people in the disaster areas and vigorously prepared goods. The grain department purchased 67 million jin of wheat, barley, pea and other seeds; the timber company prepared 180,000 cubic meters of timber for the disaster victims to repair houses and manufacture production tools; aquatic product companies and others also prepared a large number of fishing tools and raw materials.

After the floodwaters receded, the primary markets quickly became active. The grain department and supply and marketing cooperatives supplied large quantities of grain and seeds. From October 7th to 13th, Jianli County supplied 3.9 million jin of rice to the disaster victims; the Jingzhou Special District supplied more than 10 million jin of barley, wheat, broad beans and other seeds to the disaster victims. The supply and marketing cooperatives supplied a large number of fishing gear to the disaster victims. Two townships in the fourth district of Puqi County have newly added 60 fishing boats and 702 various fishing gears. In order to promptly purchase fresh fish from the disaster victims, the aquatic product department has newly established more than 500 institutions in the disaster areas, and has made a clear division of labor with the native products company and the supply and marketing cooperative; at the same time, it has signed pre-sale contracts for more than 60 million jin of fresh fish with Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Shanghai and other places. At present, more than 30,000 jin of fresh fish are on the market in Jianli County every day, and relevant departments are actively purchasing them.

In order to strengthen leadership over economic work in the disaster areas, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently organized relevant departments such as grain, cooperatives, aquatic products, and transportation to establish an Economic Work Office for Disaster Areas. This office is responsible for specifically guiding and supervising various business departments to better serve the disaster areas, helping the people in the disaster areas to restore production and rebuild their homes.

    湖北省水灾区的初级市场已经恢复起来
    湖北省水灾地区的初级市场已经恢复起来。在许多集镇等初级市场上，国营商业部门和供销合作社展开了繁忙的供应和收购业务，私营零售商大部分也已经恢复营业。灾民们每天从这里买进大批生产资料和生活资料，同时卖出大批鲜鱼等副业产品。
    水退以前，国营商业部门和供销合作社积极调查了灾区群众的需要，大力准备了货物。粮食部门采购了小麦、大麦、豌豆等种籽六千七百万斤；木材公司准备了十八万立方公尺的木材，供灾民用来修补房屋和制造生产工具；水产公司等还准备了大批捕鱼用的工具和原料。
    水退以后，初级市场便迅速活跃起来。粮食部门和供销合作社供应了大批粮食、种籽。监利县从十月七日到十三日就供应给灾民三百九十万斤大米；荆州专区供应到灾民手中的大麦、小麦和蚕豆等种籽，共有一千多万斤。供销合作社把大量捕鱼用具供应给灾民。蒲圻县第四区两个乡已新添渔船六十只、各种渔具七百零二件。为了及时收购灾民的鲜鱼，水产部门在灾区新建立了五百多个机构，并和土产公司、供销合作社进行了明确的分工；同时和北京、天津、太原、沈阳、上海等地订立了六千多万斤鲜鱼的预售合同。目前，监利县每天上市鲜鱼三万多斤，有关部门正在积极收购。
    中共湖北省委会为了加强对灾区经济工作的领导，最近组织粮食、合作、水产、交通等有关部门成立了灾区经济工作办公室。这个办公室负责具体指导和督促各业务部门更好地为灾区服务，帮助灾区人民恢复生产，重建家园。　（张成信）
