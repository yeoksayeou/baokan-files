Western European Public Opinion Opposes Revival of German Militarism
Demands Peaceful Resolution of the German Question Through Negotiations

    West Germany
    West German public opinion is dissatisfied with the London Conference resolutions on the rearmament of West Germany. They accuse Adenauer of pursuing a policy of incorporating West Germany into Western military blocs, and have widely commented on the new Soviet proposals on the German question made by Molotov at the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.
    The "Dusseldorf News" said: "Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said in Berlin that his government once again proposes the withdrawal of occupying forces from the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic. There is no reason to reject this proposal immediately."
    West Berlin's "Berlin Economic Newspaper" wrote: People originally hoped that after the collapse of the "European Defense Community," the issue of restoring German unification would occupy a primary position in government policy, but the London Conference dispelled this dream. The newspaper pointed out that building an army, militarization, and participating in military bloc systems will allow West Germany to be used against democratic countries, creating the threat of civil war in Germany. The newspaper welcomes the Soviet delegation's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly to reduce armaments, believing that arms reduction can lay the foundation for a policy that suits the actual situation. It calls for negotiations with the Soviet Union on the issue of restoring German unification, considering this to be "our only hope." The newspaper concludes, "Now is the time to loudly demand that the German people themselves express their opinions on major issues that are vitally important to them."
    During the debate in the Bonn Bundestag on October 7 regarding the London Conference resolutions, Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer accused the London Conference resolutions and Adenauer's foreign policy of "meaning abandoning an active policy of striving for unification (of Germany)." Ollenhauer said: The Social Democratic Party must reject this policy. The Social Democratic Party advocates attempting to negotiate with the Soviet Union again on the German question before adopting a policy of rearming West Germany. Therefore, Ollenhauer put forward a motion in his speech requesting the Bonn government, together with the United States, Britain, and France, to take steps to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible to discuss the reunification of Germany. Ollenhauer believes that the recent Soviet proposal for disarmament is proof of the Soviet Union's concern for easing international tensions, and he said that Molotov's speech in Berlin on the 6th was "worthy of attention."
    West German Social Democratic Party member and Vice President of the Bundestag, Schmidt, also said that organizing opposing alliance systems cannot guarantee collective security.
    Ollenhauer and Schmidt's speeches more or less reflected the sentiments of the broad masses of West German workers against the rearmament of West Germany. On October 9, at the third congress of the West German Trade Union Federation, which is controlled by the Social Democratic Party, those present almost unanimously passed a resolution opposing the London agreement on the rearmament of West Germany. The resolution demanded that before rearming West Germany, there should be a "full seeking of the possibility of peacefully unifying Germany through negotiations." The resolution condemned Adenauer's policy of attempting to make West Germany participate in the Western military system as "threatening the possibility of reunifying Germany."

    Britain
    British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt published an article in London's "Daily Worker," discussing the current situation and the tasks of the British working class.
    Pollitt said: "The London Nine-Power Conference agreement was warmly welcomed at the Conservative Party's annual meeting in Blackpool, which proves that this agreement is dangerous to the working people and to lasting peace. If this agreement is ratified, it will open a wide path for German arms dealers to realize their plans to launch a new war; and in this war, as Churchill often mentioned to us, Britain will be at the front line. The main task of all good people and all democratic and progressive organizations is not to allow this agreement to be ratified. The working class should bear the main responsibility. Therefore, the role of the labor movement will be of decisive significance in the recent period."
    Pollitt called on everyone to unite and strive to achieve the following general program: oppose arming Germany, demand the conclusion of a European collective security treaty that can guarantee the security of all countries; admit the People's Republic of China into the United Nations; ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, and achieve universal disarmament; strive for Britain's national independence and for Britain to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace; abolish all bans on East-West trade; support the struggle of the people of Malaya, Kenya, British Guiana, and all colonies and dependencies for freedom. On the domestic front, demand: increase wages, improve the social security system; formulate a rent law; increase housing construction, improve the education system and the health care system; and implement broader nationalization.

    Denmark
    The Danish Communist Party Congress passed a resolution on October 9, advocating that the Danish people themselves, and not the Danish government, should decide Denmark's attitude towards the re-militarization of West Germany.
    The resolution pointed out that the Danish government had firmly opposed the re-militarization of West Germany in 1947 with the support of the entire people, but now, the government claims to support the resolutions of the London Conference.
    The resolution called on the Danish people to resolutely refuse to support German militarization, advocating "solving the German question through consultation, unifying Germany into a democratic and neutral country, and establishing European collective security."
    The resolution also said: "If Denmark expresses opposition to West Germany joining the North Atlantic Alliance, it will hinder the plan to quickly arm West Germany. The government has no right to say 'yes' on behalf of Denmark. The Danish people demand respect for their opinions and demand that they themselves decide on what resolutions Denmark should sign."
    The resolution said: "During the liberation struggle, the Danish people fought against German militarism. Let us now unite again and shout 'Oppose' arming West Germany, 'Support' peaceful cooperation among the people of all countries."

    西欧国家公众舆论反对复活德国军国主义
    要求通过谈判和平解决德国问题
      西德
    西德公众舆论不满伦敦会议关于重新武装西德问题的决议，他们指责阿登纳所奉行的使西德加入西方军事集团的政策，并广泛地就莫洛托夫在德意志民主共和国成立五周年的庆祝会上发表的演说中所提出的苏联对德国问题的新建议发表了评论。
    “杜塞尔多夫新闻”说：“苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在柏林说，他的政府再一次建议从联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国中撤退占领军。没有理由立刻就拒绝这个建议。”
    西柏林的“柏林经济报”写道：人们原来希望，在“欧洲防务集团”垮台之后，恢复德国统一的问题就将在政府政策中占首要的地位，但是，伦敦会议驱散了这种梦想。报纸指出，建立军队、军国主义化和参加军事集团体系，将使西德被利用来反对民主阵营国家，将造成在德国发生内战的威胁。这家报纸欢迎苏联代表团在联合国大会上提出的裁减军备的建议，认为缩减军备可以为切合实际情况的政策奠定基础。它要求就恢复德国统一问题和苏联进行谈判，认为这是“我们唯一的希望”。这家报纸最后写道，“现在是大声疾呼，要求让德国人民自己对切身利害攸关的重大问题发表意见的时候了。”
    在十月七日波恩联邦议院就伦敦会议的决议举行辩论时，社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔指责伦敦会议的决议和阿登纳的外交政策“意味着抛弃争取统一（德国）的积极的政策。”奥伦豪尔说：社会民主党必须拒绝这种政策。社会民主党主张在采取重新武装西德政策之前，再一次试图就德国问题和苏联进行谈判。因此，奥伦豪尔在发言中提出了一项动议，要求波恩政府和美、英、法三国一起采取步骤，尽早与苏联举行谈判，讨论重新统一德国的问题。奥伦豪尔认为：苏联最近提出的裁减军备的建议是苏联关心缓和国际紧张局势的证明，他并且说：莫洛托夫六日在柏林发表的演讲是“值得注意的”。
    西德社会民主党议员、联邦议院副主席施密特也说：组织对立的联盟体系不能保证集体安全。
    奥伦豪尔和施密特的发言多少反映了广大西德工人反对重新武装西德的情绪。十月九日，在社会民主党把持下的西德工会联合会第三次代表大会上，到会者差不多全体一致地通过了一项决议，反对关于重新武装西德的伦敦协议。决议要求在重新武装西德以前首先要“充分寻求通过谈判和平统一德国的可能性”。决议谴责阿登纳企图使西德参加西方军事体系的政策“威胁到了重新统一德国的可能性”。
    英国
    英国共产党总书记波立特在伦敦“工人日报”发表文章，谈到目前的形势和英国工人阶级的任务。
    波立特说：“伦敦九国会议的协定受到在布拉克浦举行的保守党年会的热烈欢迎，这就证明了这个协定对劳动人民、对持久和平都是危险的。这个协定如果被批准，就会给德国军火商打开一条大路来实现发动新战争的计划；而在这个战争中，正如邱吉尔时常向我们提到的那样，英国会处在前线。所有善良的人们和所有民主、进步组织的主要任务，就是不允许批准这个协定。工人阶级应负起主要的责任。因此，工人运动的作用在最近一个时期会有决定性意义。”
    波立特号召大家团结起来，为实现下面的总纲领而奋斗。这个总纲领就是：反对武装德国，要求缔结可以保证所有国家的安全的欧洲集体安全条约；接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国；禁止原子武器和氢武器，普遍裁减军备；争取英国的民族独立，争取英国执行独立的和平外交政策；取消对东西方贸易的一切禁令；支持马来亚、怯尼亚、英属圭亚那以及所有殖民地和附属国人民争取自由的斗争。在国内战线上，要求：提高工资，改善社会保险制度；制订房租法；增加住宅建筑，改进教育制度和保健制度；实行更广泛的国有化。
    丹麦
    丹麦共产党代表会议十月九日通过一项决议，主张由丹麦人民自己，而不是丹麦政府，来决定丹麦对于西德重新军国主义化的态度。
    决议指出：丹麦政府曾经在一九四七年在全体人民支持下坚决反对西德重新军国主义化，但是现在，政府却声言支持伦敦会议的决议。
    决议号召丹麦人民坚决拒绝支持德国军国主义化，主张“经由协商解决德国问题，把德国统一成为一个民主和中立的国家，并建立欧洲集体安全。”
    决议还说：“如果丹麦表示反对西德加入北大西洋联盟，那就将妨碍迅速武装西德的计划。政府没有权利代表丹麦说‘可以’。丹麦人民要求尊重他们的意见，要求自己决定丹麦应该在怎样的决议上签字。”
    决议说：“在解放斗争的时候，丹麦人民曾经和德国军国主义作过战。让我们现在再团结一致，高呼‘反对’武装西德，‘拥护’各国人民和平合作”。
