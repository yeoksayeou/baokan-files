    Farmers in Daren County, northern Shanxi Province, are building a windbreak forest network on barren sandy dunes. In the past, every time the wind blew, sand and dust filled the sky, and crops often had to be replanted seven or eight times before they could sprout. This spring and autumn, under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, local farmers began to build a windbreak forest network. The survival rate of more than 7,700 mu of poplar forest planted and nurtured in the spring reached over 85 percent, with the highest reaching 99.2 percent. Twenty-four grid patterns of interwoven forest belts have already been formed in the eastern part of the forest network. The western part of the forest network, which was recently started, is expected to be completed in November. It is estimated that in more than ten years, all 26,000 mu of barren land here will be transformed into fertile farmland, beautiful orchards, and green grasslands.

    山西省大仁县营造防风林网
    山西省北部大仁县农民正在大沙丘荒滩上营造防风林网。过去每次风起便沙土横飞天昏地暗，农作物常常需要改种七八次才能捉苗。今年春秋两季，当地农民在人民政府领导和帮助下，开始营造防风林网。春季营造、抚育的七千七百多亩杨树林，成活率达到百分之八十五以上，最高的达百分之九十九点二。现在林网东部已形成纵横交错的二十四个林网格；最近开始营造的林网西部，十一月间可全部营造完毕。预计十多年后，这里的二万六千亩贫瘠土地将全部变为肥沃良田、美丽的果园和绿色的草地。（新华社）
