I followed the flow of people into the Central Hall, looked at the exhibits in the Publications and Vocational Education Hall, the Higher Education Hall, and the Musical Instruments, Radio and Furniture Hall, climbed the wooden stairs, and arrived at the Handicrafts Hall, which was full of Russian folk colors. Various Soviet folk handicrafts are displayed here. One hundred and fifty milky white lamps on the ceiling of the hall emit dazzling light.

Next to the northern exhibition stand, under two bright red transparent plastic large round lamps, are rows of painted lacquer boxes. These are the masterpieces of famous handicraft masters from Palekh, Khokhloma, Mstera and other places in the Soviet Union. The appearance of the lacquer box is similar to the lacquerware produced in Fujian, China, but the paintings on the box cover have richer content. A Soviet expert told me about the production process of the lacquer box: first, use cardboard to make a blank, then apply multiple layers of paint, bake it dry, paint on it, and then apply oil and bake it dry. Before the revolution, only Mstera could produce this kind of lacquer box in the Soviet Union. After the revolution, it developed to three places. The content of the drawings reflects the reality of the lives of the Soviet people, promotes patriotism and internationalism; some are taken from myths and fairy tales; some are painted with portraits of great men. For example, on the lid of a lacquer box, there is a beautiful Chinese rural scene: there is a temple on a small mountain, a tractor at the foot of the mountain, and an old farmer is holding the hand of a Soviet tractor driver tightly; another farmer is holding a plate of rich fresh fruits and serving the distinguished guests diligently. Farmers came from all directions to welcome them, including white-haired grandmothers and babies in their arms. This is a picture of "the friendship and assistance of the Soviet people to the Chinese people." On another lacquer box, the harvest scene of the Soviet countryside is depicted: the old members of the collective farm are reading the newly promulgated law on collective farms, while the members are listening attentively with joy after the harvest. There is also a painting on a lacquer box depicting a wedding held in a collective farm: a happy young couple is dressed up very beautifully. The villagers are wearing brightly colored costumes to congratulate them. Some are based on Pushkin's "The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish": the upper right corner is the old fisherman fishing by the sea, with a golden fish in his net. In the middle is his insatiable old wife instructing him to make demands to the golden fish. Another painting depicts how Ivan Susanin led foreign invaders astray. Some are painted with the great images of Lenin and Stalin; some are painted with scenes such as the Kremlin and the Moscow City Soviet Office Building.

I was squeezed by young girls to a large glass cabinet displaying lace. They were talking about their preferences. The style of the lace is very similar to that woven by women in Yantai, China, but the color is white and clean, and the pattern is delicate and even. The narrator said: Because the living standards of the Soviet people are constantly improving, the use of lace has become very common. Some use it as edging on clothing, and some use it to make bed sheets, curtains, tablecloths, napkins, collars, shawls, and decorations on sofas. What is exhibited here are only the products of craft factories in Kirov, Ryazan, and Ellis, among which the most exquisite are from Kirov Province.

The embroidery art of the Soviet people is also well known. More than sixty kinds of embroidery handicrafts are displayed here. The embroidery of girls in Gorky Province is simple in color: white, pink, and sky-blue silk are embroidered with small white flowers. People use it to make shirts. The famous colorful cross and half-cross embroidered underwear pieces of the Ukrainian Republic are also on display here. The embroidery of Ryazan Province is bright in color and diverse in variety, including drawn thread work, cross stitch, half-cross stitch and other varieties. Cross stitch is similar to Beijing's drawn thread work in China, but the colors and patterns are different. The embroidery of girls in the Uzbek Republic is very gorgeous. They use gold silk, silver silk and five-colored silk threads to embroider various patterns and flowers on satin, which are used to make small round hats, pillowcases, sofa cushion covers and ethnic costumes. On a rotating display rack, there is a towel used for decoration embroidered with the words "World Peace," which is the masterpiece of a girl from a certain place in Belarus.

Also on display here are pink, sky-blue, and white artificial gemstone ornaments, as well as yellow amber necklaces and brooches. In addition, there is a yellow chess set and chess pieces made of amber, cigarette holders and buttons.

Various porcelain products are displayed on the western exhibition stand. Six large porcelain vases with white base and blue or red flowers attract people's attention. These were made by craftsmen from the Lomonosov Factory in Leningrad in imitation of the Chinese vase style and are welcomed by the Soviet people. Here, people can not only see the statues of the great writer Gorky and the poet Mayakovsky, but also the ugly images of Chichikov, Manilov and Sobakevich in Gogol's famous book "Dead Souls", and Antonovich and Alexandrovich in "The Government Inspector". The craftsmen also shaped the beautiful images of Young Pioneer trumpeters, young skiers, young biologists and animal breeders, and violinists. There are also animals such as little goats, minks, deer and beavers. Another part is daily-use coffee utensils, tea sets, milk utensils and butter dishes.

More than four hundred pieces of exquisite crystal and glassware are displayed on the south side of the exhibition stand. Among them are the high-quality glassware from the Soviet Carved Glass Factory on the Gus River near Moscow, and the artistic glassware from Leningrad, Kiev, and Gajikowski. Among them are bottles, jars, goblets and saucers. Crystal utensils are even more exquisite, with delicate patterns and diverse patterns, some are light yellow and some are emerald green. These crystal and glassware have become essential items in every ordinary Soviet family, and hospitable hosts often use them to serve food and fine wine to entertain guests. On display here are small flower baskets, saucers, tea caddies, small spoons, etc. with silver shells and gold lining, as well as various exquisite cigarette boxes.

As I was leaving the exhibition hall, a Soviet expert shook my hand and said: The Soviet Union not only pays attention to the development of industry, but also pays attention to supporting and developing handicrafts. For example, setting up specialized schools to train talents in order to continuously improve the output and quality of handicrafts.

    精致的苏联手工艺品
    ——介绍苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中的手工艺品馆
    沈文英
    我随着人流涌进中央大厅，看了出版物和职业教育馆、高等教育馆和乐器、无线电家具馆的展品，登上木阶梯，到了饶有俄罗斯民间色彩的手工艺品馆。这里陈列着苏联民间的各种手工艺品。厅内天花板上的一百五十盏乳白色灯，发出耀眼的光芒。
    北部展览台旁，在两盏鲜红色的透明的胶制大圆灯下，摆着一排排彩绘漆匣。这是苏联巴列赫、浩赫洛玛、蒙斯吉里等地著名手工艺匠师的杰作。漆匣的外观和我国福建产的漆器相像，但匣盖上的绘画有着更丰富的内容。苏联专家告诉我关于漆匣的制作过程：先用硬纸做成胎，再涂上多层油漆，烤干后绘上画，再上油烤干。苏联在革命以前，只有蒙斯吉里一处能生产这种漆匣，革命后发展到三处。绘图的内容，有反映苏联人民的现实生活的，有宣扬爱国主义和国际主义精神的；有的取材于神话和童话；有的画着伟人像。例如，有一只漆匣盖上画着优美的中国农村景色：在小山上有一座庙，山脚下有一台拖拉机，一个老农民紧握着苏联拖拉机手的手；另一个农民端着一盘丰盛的鲜果，殷勤地款待贵宾。农民们从四面八方来欢迎，其中有白发的老奶奶，有抱在怀里的娃娃。这就是“苏联人民对中国人民的友谊援助”图。在另一只漆匣上，绘着苏联农村的丰收景象：集体农庄的老庄员在宣读刚公布的集体农庄新法律，而庄员们则带着丰收后喜悦的心情围着细听。还有一个漆匣上的画，描绘了一个集体农庄中举行的婚礼：一对幸福的青年男女，装扮得十分美丽。庄员们穿着鲜艳的服装来祝贺。有的则以诗人普希金“渔夫和金鱼的故事”为题材：右上角是老渔夫在海边打鱼，网中有一条金鱼。中间是他那贪得无厌的老伴在指使他去向金鱼提出要求。还有一幅描画了伊凡苏萨宁如何把外国侵略者带入歧途。有的绘了列宁、斯大林的伟大形像；有的画着克里姆林宫、莫斯科市苏维埃办公厅等景色。
    我被年轻的姑娘们挤到陈列着花边的大玻璃橱旁。她们谈论着各人的喜爱。花边的式样和我国烟台妇女编织的很相似，但色泽白净，花纹细腻均匀。讲解员说：由于苏联人民生活水平不断提高，使用花边已很普遍。有的把它用作服装上的镶边，有的用它来做床单、窗帘、桌布、餐巾、领子、披肩和沙发上的装饰品等。这里展出的只是基洛夫、梁赞、伊利斯等地工艺厂的产品，其中以基洛夫省的最精美。
    苏联人民的刺绣艺术也是人们所熟知的。这里陈列有六十多种刺绣工艺品。高尔基省少女的刺绣，颜色素净：白色、粉色、天蓝色的绸上绣着白色小花。人们用它来制作衬衣。享有盛名的乌克兰共和国的五彩十字和半十字绣内衣绣片，也在这里展出。梁赞省的刺绣，色彩鲜艳，种类繁多，有抽丝、十字绣、半十字绣等多种。十字绣和我国北京的挑花相似，但色彩花样不相同。乌兹别克共和国少女的刺绣，十分艳丽。她们用金丝、银丝和五色丝线在缎上绣上各种图案和花朵，用以制作小圆帽、枕套、沙发垫套子和民族服装。在转动的展览架上，有一条用作装饰的手巾上面绣着“世界和平”的字样，这是别洛露西亚某地一个少女的杰作。
    这里还陈列着粉色、天蓝色、白色的人造宝石饰物，以及黄色的琥珀项圈和别针。此外，还有一副用琥珀做成的黄色的国际象棋盘和棋子，烟咀和钮扣。
    西边展览台上陈列着各种瓷制品。六个白底蓝花或红花的瓷制大花瓶，吸引着人们的注意。这是列宁格勒罗蒙诺索夫工厂的工艺师仿造中国花瓶的形式制成的，受到苏联人民的欢迎。这里，人们不仅可以看到文豪高尔基、诗人马雅可夫斯基的塑像，还可以看到果戈理名著“死魂灵”中的乞乞科夫、玛尼罗夫和梭巴开罗支，“钦差大臣”中的安东诺维奇、阿历山大洛维奇等的丑恶形象。匠师们还塑造了少先队的小号手，小滑雪家，年青生物学家和饲畜家，小提琴手等的美丽形像。还有小公山羊、貂鼠、鹿和海狸等动物。另一部分是日用咖啡器皿、茶具、牛奶具和放黄油的碟子等。
    南边的展览台上展出了四百多件精制的水晶、玻璃制品。其中有莫斯科附近古斯河河畔的苏联车花玻璃工厂的上等玻璃制品，列宁格勒、基辅、加吉柯夫斯基等地的艺术玻璃制品。其中有瓶、罐、高脚杯和碟子。水晶器皿更是精美，花纹细腻，花样繁多，有浅黄的，有翠绿的。这些水晶和玻璃器皿，已成为苏联每一个普通家庭的必备用品，好客的主人常常用它来盛食品、美酒款待客人。这里陈列有银壳金里的小花篮、小碟、茶叶罐、小勺等，还有各种精致的纸烟盒子。
    当我离开展览馆时，一位苏联专家握住我的手说：苏联不但注意发展工业，同时还注意扶持和发展手工艺。例如，开办专门学校，培养人材，以不断提高手工艺品的产量和质量。
