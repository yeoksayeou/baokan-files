    [Report from our newspaper] On the 21st morning, Prime Minister Nehru of the Republic of India, accompanied by his daughter Mrs. Indira Gandhi and his entourage, toured the Temple of Heaven, Yonghe Lamasery, and the Forbidden City in Beijing. Accompanying Prime Minister Nehru were Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, Yuan Zhongxian, our ambassador to India, Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Protocol Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Indian Ambassador to China, Mr. R.K. Nehru and his wife.

    At the Temple of Heaven, Prime Minister Nehru and others viewed the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, the Imperial Vault of Heaven, the Echo Wall, and the Circular Mound Altar, all famous attractions known in world architectural history. Prime Minister Nehru and his daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, spoke to each other from opposite sides of the Echo Wall, testing the echo. They were very interested in this ancient Chinese architecture, which demonstrated a high level of scientific and artistic achievement. Prime Minister Nehru particularly liked the scenery near the Circular Mound Altar, and he specifically asked the accompanying reporter to take a photo of him with the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests in the distance as a background.

    At the Yonghe Lamasery, Prime Minister Nehru and others viewed the statue of Sakyamuni Buddha in the Yongyou Hall, observed the lamas chanting the Sutra of Longevity, and saw the 25-meter-high statue of the Tathagata Buddha in the Wanfu Pavilion. They gazed at this huge Buddha statue for a long time and asked the accompanying personnel about it.

    At the Forbidden City, Prime Minister Nehru and others first went to the Hall of Supreme Harmony to see ancient Chinese art. Here, Prime Minister Nehru and others viewed the tiger-striped stone chime, the Guo Ji Bai Pan, the crane-shaped pot, the green-glazed lotus vase, and other cultural relics with artistic and archaeological value, as well as the valuable works of famous ancient Chinese painters such as Lu Lengjia and Chen Mei. Then, Prime Minister Nehru and others went to the Painting Gallery in the Huangji Hall. They admired the large-scale works such as "The Night Revels of Han Xizai" painted by Gu Hongzhong of the Five Dynasties, "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" painted by Zhang Zeduan of the Song Dynasty, and "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" painted by Wang Ximeng. Finally, Prime Minister Nehru and others visited the Zhongcui Palace. Here are displayed the replicas of the famous Dunhuang Grottoes murals, a great cultural and artistic heritage of China, and the replicas of the statues of the Maijishan Grottoes, the Buddhist center of China in the fifth century AD. These simple and beautiful works of art reflect the influence of Indian culture and art on China in ancient times and the cultural and artistic exchanges between the two great nations of China and India. Prime Minister Nehru and others carefully viewed the exhibits here with great interest.
   [Xinhua News Agency, 21st] Mrs. Indira Gandhi, daughter of Prime Minister Nehru, who is visiting our country with Prime Minister Nehru, visited the Beijing Women's Embroidery Production Cooperative and the home of a female medical worker on the afternoon of the 21st.

    At the embroidery production cooperative, Mrs. Indira Gandhi visited the embroidery production process and some embroidery products, and inquired about the work, study and life of the more than 3,000 members of the cooperative who are dispersed in household production and dozens of centralized production units. She was greatly interested in this exquisite embroidery handicraft.

    During her visit to the home of a female medical worker at Beijing Tongren Hospital, the hostess introduced her family situation in detail. Mrs. Indira Gandhi learned from the visit that the hostess was an unemployed woman before liberation, but after liberation she obtained a job and actively participated in social activities. Mrs. Indira Gandhi said that she was very happy with the visit, which gave her a better understanding of an ordinary Chinese family.

    On the afternoon of the 21st, some of the entourage who accompanied Prime Minister Nehru to visit our country visited the Exhibition of Soviet Economic and Cultural Achievements.
