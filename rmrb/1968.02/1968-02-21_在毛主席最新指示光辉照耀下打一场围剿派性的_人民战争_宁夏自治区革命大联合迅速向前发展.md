Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary great alliance in Ningxia is surging forward like a mighty torrent. At present, more than half of the counties and cities in the entire autonomous region have achieved revolutionary great alliance, and revolutionary committees at the grassroots level are springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

"Setting up study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The preparatory committee of the Ningxia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist forces in Ningxia, following the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively helped local revolutionary masses set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, the entire region has held over 5,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 500,000 participants. In these study classes, revolutionary masses from various factions fiercely combat the "self" and firmly establish the "public," launching a "people's war" to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Chairman Mao's latest instructions quickly became the practical actions of the broad revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary great alliance has achieved a great situation. The revolutionary mass organizations in the capital city of Yinchuan have, through combating selfishness and criticizing revisionism in study classes, significantly raised their ideological awareness. They said, "Chairman Mao calls on us to achieve revolutionary great alliance. If we only say we want great alliance verbally but actually engage in factionalism, that would be the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao." The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations did not wait for the study classes to end before reaching an agreement to achieve revolutionary great alliance, forming a Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee, and convening the city workers' congress and farmers' congress. The various revolutionary mass organizations in Shiquanshan, an important industrial base in the autonomous region, had previously undergone multiple negotiations but could not unite. This time, with the patient help of the local support-leftist forces, they continuously held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They shifted from attacking each other's shortcomings to fiercely combating their own factionalism and affirming each other's strengths, finally quickly achieving revolutionary great alliance.

To promote revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in various places, members of the autonomous region revolutionary committee preparatory group and the broad masses of support-leftist forces went deep into factories, villages, offices, and schools. They vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary great alliance, patiently and meticulously conducted political and ideological work among the masses. In recent days, responsible comrades of the autonomous region revolutionary committee preparatory group personally went to the Second Coal Mine of Shiquanshan Mining Bureau, the Ningxia Construction Company, the Yinchuan Rubber Factory, and the Yinchuan Carpet Factory, and had discussions with workers to solve practical problems. This has played a very good role in promoting and consolidating the revolutionary great alliance in these factories and mines. The broad masses of support-leftist forces of the People's Liberation Army in Ningxia firmly responded to Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao's call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," and resolutely implemented the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. They studied, implemented, and carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the revolutionary masses, making outstanding contributions to achieving revolutionary great alliance in many counties, cities, and grassroots units in the entire region.

Now, the people of Ningxia, under the correct leadership of the autonomous region revolutionary committee preparatory group, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and striving to further launch a high tide of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination. They are working hard to strive for the early birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee.

    在毛主席最新指示光辉照耀下打一场围剿派性的“人民战争”
    宁夏自治区革命大联合迅速向前发展
    新华社银川十九日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，宁夏革命大联合的洪流汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前。目前，全自治区已有一半以上的县、市实现了革命大联合，基层革命委员会如雨后春笋般一批又一批地建立起来。
    “办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”自治区革命委员会筹备小组和人民解放军驻宁支左部队，遵循伟大领袖毛主席这一最新指示，积极帮助各地革命群众大办毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，全区已办了五千多期毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的达五十多万人次。在学习班上，各派革命群众狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，展开了一场围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，毛主席的最新指示迅速化为广大革命群众的实际行动，革命大联合出现大好局面。自治区首府银川市各派革命群众组织，通过在学习班上斗私批修，思想觉悟大大提高。他们说，毛主席号召我们实现革命的大联合，如果我们只是口头上说要大联合，实际上都在闹派性，那就是对毛主席最大的不忠。各派革命群众组织的头头不等学习结束，就达成实现革命大联合的协议，成立了革命大联合委员会，并召开了市工代会和农代会。自治区重要工业基地石咀山市各派革命群众组织，过去虽然经过多次协商，但一直联合不起来。这次，他们在当地支左部队的耐心帮助下，连续举办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓毛主席最新指示的落实问题，从过去攻击对方的缺点，到狠斗自己的派性，肯定对方的长处，终于迅速实现了革命的大联合。
    为了推动各地革命大联合和革命三结合的发展，区革筹小组成员和支左部队广大指战员深入厂矿、农村、机关和学校，大力宣传毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示，耐心细致地对群众进行政治思想工作。这些天来，区革筹小组负责同志亲自下到石咀山矿务局第二煤矿、自治区建筑公司、银川橡胶厂和银川地毯厂等厂矿，和工人一起座谈，解决实际问题，对促进和巩固这些厂矿的革命大联合起了很好的作用。人民解放军驻宁夏支左部队广大指战员，坚决响应林彪副统帅“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的号召，坚决执行支左不支派的原则，同革命群众一起学习、贯彻、落实毛主席的最新指示，为全区许多县市和基层单位实现革命大联合作出了卓越的贡献。
    现在，宁夏人民在区革筹小组的正确领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，鼓足干劲，力争上游，进一步掀起革命大联合和革命三结合的高潮，为宁夏回族自治区革命委员会的早日诞生而努力奋斗。
