Forever Follow the Great Leader Mao Zedong
The Revolutionary People of the Soviet Union and Eastern European Countries Deeply Love Chairman Mao

Great Mao Zedong!

Once, Chinese comrades visited Stalin's hometown in the Soviet Union, Georgia. As soon as they entered a city, they were surrounded by enthusiastic working people. People were raising their thumbs and chanting in rhythm: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!"

When the Chinese comrades were riding a bus, the conductor enthusiastically said, "You are our good friends, you are the good soldiers of Mao Zedong!"

On the streets of some cities, countless Soviet people repeatedly came up to the Chinese comrades, raising their arms and shouting, "Mao Zedong, great! Great Mao Zedong!"

We deeply love Mao Zedong!

Once, Chinese comrades were waiting for a train at a station in Czechoslovakia. A Czechoslovakian worker came up to them and enthusiastically said, "We fully support Mao Zedong, we deeply love Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong is a great Marxist-Leninist." After saying this, he hurried away.

Another time, also at a station, a Czechoslovakian traveler saw the Chinese comrades and immediately raised his thumb, saying affectionately, "Mao Zedong!"

We resolutely follow the path of Mao Zedong!

On a holiday, Chinese comrades encountered a group of miners on a mountain road in Bulgaria. The miners enthusiastically waved to the Chinese comrades and shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!" One of the workers said, "We are all Communist Party members, we all resolutely want to follow the path of Mao Zedong, oppose the revisionist line of the Bulgarian leadership. We will not yield!"

A Bulgarian peasant woman saw several Chinese comrades with shining Mao Chairman badges on their chests in a city street. She was attracted by the badges. She looked at the badges on the Chinese comrades' chests with admiration. Later, she said softly but excitedly, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!"

The Chinese comrades understood her feelings and immediately gave her a Mao Chairman badge. She took the badge with both hands and held it to her chest, as if she had a thousand words to say to the Chinese comrades, but she was too excited to speak.

After a while, she said, "I have a portrait of Mao Zedong at home, which I have kept for more than ten years. Today, I have received a Mao Chairman badge, this is too happy! We Bulgarians will forever love Mao Zedong!"

Let the people of the world revolution all wear Mao Chairman badges

In the German Democratic Republic, an old worker, to express his love for Chairman Mao, secretly commissioned an artist to design a badge pattern. The pattern featured the side profiles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong, the five great leaders of the world proletariat. After the badge pattern was completed, the old man carefully wrapped it in glass paper and traveled to Berlin. He found the Chinese comrades and, with tears of excitement, handed the badge pattern to the Chinese comrades. He said earnestly, "Please take it to Mao Zedong. I hope that in Chinese factories, such badges will be made. I believe that one day, all the revolutionary people of the world will wear such badges!"

    永远跟着伟大领袖毛泽东
    苏联和东欧国家革命人民无限热爱毛主席
    伟大的毛泽东！
    一次，中国同志到斯大林的故乡——苏联格鲁吉亚参观。他们刚进入一个城市，便被许多热情的劳动群众围拢起来。人们翘着大拇指，不断有节奏地高呼：“毛泽东！”“毛泽东！”
    中国同志在乘公共汽车时，售票员热情地说：“你们是我们的好朋友，你们是毛泽东的好战士！”
    在一些城市的街头，不知有多少苏联人，一次又一次地走到中国同志面前，振臂高呼：“毛泽东，伟大！”“伟大的毛泽东！”
    我们非常热爱毛泽东！
    一次，中国同志在捷克斯洛伐克一个车站等车时，一位捷克斯洛伐克工人走到他们跟前，热情地说：“我们完全拥护毛泽东，我们非常热爱毛泽东！毛泽东是伟大的马克思列宁主义者。”说完，他就匆匆地走了。
    另一次，也是在一个车站上，一位捷克斯洛伐克旅客见到了中国同志，立刻伸出大拇指，亲切地说：“毛泽东！”
    我们坚决走毛泽东的道路！
    一个假日，中国同志在保加利亚一条山路上，碰到一群矿工。矿工们热情地向中国同志挥手致意，并高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”其中一位工人说：“我们都是共产党员，我们都坚决要走毛泽东的道路，反对保修领导集团的修正主义路线。我们决不屈服。”
    一位保加利亚农村妇女，在某城的街头，看到几位中国同志的胸前都佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章。她被这像章吸引住了。她带着羡慕的神情朝着中国同志胸前的像章久久凝视。后来，她小声而又兴奋地说：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”
    中国同志领悟了她的心情，立刻把一枚毛主席像章赠送给她。她双手接过像章，捧到胸前，好象有千言万语要对中国同志讲，但是由于太激动了，一时什么也说不出来。
    过了一会，她说：“我家有一张毛泽东的像，我保存了十多年了。今天，我又得到了毛主席像章，这太幸福了！我们保加利亚人，永远热爱毛泽东！”
    让世界革命人民都戴上毛主席像章
    在德意志民主共和国，一位老工人为了表达对毛主席的热爱，秘密地请了一位画工设计了一个像章图案。图案上画着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席这五位世界无产阶级的伟大领袖的侧面像。像章图案设计好了以后，老人小心翼翼地用玻璃纸把它包好，专程赶到柏林。他找到了中国同志，并且含着激动的热泪，把像章图案交给中国同志。他语重心长地说：“请你们把它带给毛泽东同志。我希望在中国工厂制造这样的像章。我相信，总有一天全世界革命人民都将戴上这种像章！”
