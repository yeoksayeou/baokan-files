The heroic military and civilian forces of South Vietnam have struck a devastating blow to the American imperialists during their New Year Offensive, exposing the true nature of the American "paper tiger." Refusing to accept defeat, the Johnson administration is hastily recruiting cannon fodder to be sent to South Vietnam. However, as the war in Vietnam escalates and American casualties rise, the shortage of American troops has become increasingly severe, further exposing the weakness of this "paper tiger."

According to a report by the Associated Press on the 14th, the recent decision by the Johnson administration to send an additional 1,050 troops to South Vietnam has significantly impacted the strength of the U.S. regular army's strategic reserve forces. High-ranking military officials have stated that these reserves have been depleted to a dangerous level.

On the same day, the *Wall Street Journal* pointed out that among these 1,050 troops is a brigade from the 82nd Airborne Division, which was originally intended to be a mobile force for suppressing nationalist liberation movements in Latin America and domestic struggles in the United States. This indicates that "the number of combat-ready troops that the U.S. can deploy to Vietnam is now quite limited."

At the same time, various American bourgeois newspapers have revealed that due to the long front lines of aggression, especially the severe depletion caused by the war in Vietnam, the Johnson administration has very few mobile troops left to deploy.

The mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, *U.S. News & World Report*, recently expressed concern about the shortage of American troops, noting that the U.S. has military treaties with over forty countries and puppet regimes, obligating it to send troops to "protect" them. This has placed the U.S. in a highly passive position. The publication worried that the war in Vietnam "has depleted manpower, weapons, and other war equipment at a speed that the Johnson administration did not initially anticipate." Therefore, "the U.S. has almost no more troops that can be drawn from its active duty forces." If a second conflict were to arise in the Far East, the Middle East, or elsewhere, "American forces would be spread thin and in great danger."

In an article discussing the shortage of American troops, the *Wall Street Journal* also acknowledged that the war in Vietnam has consumed a large amount of American manpower, dealing a fatal blow to the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary global strategy. The newspaper noted that the Kennedy administration had previously expanded the so-called "special forces" to suppress nationalist liberation movements around the world. "However, the Vietnam War has already exhausted most of these capabilities that were increased in the early 1960s," thus rendering the U.S. imperialists' strategy of acting as the "world's police" a failure.

    南越军民新春攻势打得美帝纸老虎原形毕露
    美报刊承认侵越战争消耗大量有生力量使美帝侵略兵力严重不足
    据新华社十六日讯　被英雄的越南南方军民的新春攻势打得落花流水的美帝国主义，由于不甘心它的失败，正加紧在国内搜罗炮灰派往南越“抢险”。但是，随着侵越战争不断“升级”和美国侵略军伤亡直线上升，美帝侵略兵力不足的困难正变得越来越严重，进一步暴露出这个“纸老虎”的虚弱本质。
    据美联社十四日透露：约翰逊政府最近增兵一万零五百人去南越的决定，使得美国“正规部队战略后备队的力量受到很大影响，据高级军官说，这种后备队已经消耗到了危险的地步”。
    同一天的《华尔街日报》也指出：这一万零五百人当中，包括有属于第八十二空降师的一个旅，而这个空降师，本来是美国反动当局留作镇压拉丁美洲人民民族解放斗争和美国国内人民斗争的一支机动力量，这说明，“美国可以用来部署到越南去的战斗部队已经相当微少了”。
    与此同时，一些美国资产阶级报刊也纷纷透露，由于侵略战线太长，特别是由于侵越战争的严重消耗，约翰逊政府手头已经没有多少机动的兵力可以调动。
    美国垄断资本的喉舌《美国新闻与世界报道》，最近在评述美国兵力拮据的状况时十分不安地指出，美国由于同四十多个国家和傀儡集团订有军事条约，承担了出兵“保护”它们的“义务”，使自己陷于极其被动的地位。这家刊物担心地说，侵越战争，“以约翰逊政府当初似未预料到的速度耗尽了人力、武器和其他战争装备”，所以，“美国从现役部队中已经没有什么力量可以抽调了”，“如果远东、中东或其他地方发生第二个冲突，美国的力量就会分得很散，十分危险”。
    《华尔街日报》在一篇评论美国兵力不足的文章中还沮丧地承认，侵越战争消耗了美国的大量有生力量，使美帝国主义的反革命全球战略遭到了致命的打击。这家报纸谈到，前肯尼迪政府曾经为加紧镇压世界各地的民族解放运动，而大力扩充常规部队的所谓“特种部队”，“但是，现在越南战争已经把在六十年代初期增加的这些能力的大部分都耗光了”，从而使美帝到处充当“世界宪兵”的反革命战略陷于破产。
