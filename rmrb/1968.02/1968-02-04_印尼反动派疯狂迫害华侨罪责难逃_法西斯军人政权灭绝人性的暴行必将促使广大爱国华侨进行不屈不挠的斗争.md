The Indonesian reactionaries' mad persecution of overseas Chinese is inexcusable. The fascist military regime's inhumane atrocities will inevitably spur the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese to wage an unyielding struggle.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated February 3, news from Jakarta: In the face of the developing revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, which is beset with difficulties, has, under the direction and coordination of its American imperialist masters, recently launched a large-scale campaign of arson, murder, and looting against the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese who have lived for generations in West Kalimantan, committing the most barbaric anti-Chinese atrocities.

Under the direct command of Suharto, the reactionary military authorities in West Kalimantan, in collusion with local Dayak reactionary leaders, launched this large-scale anti-Chinese campaign in mid-October last year. According to reports, from mid-October to mid-November, in one month, more than 40 areas in West Kalimantan saw overseas Chinese suffer looting.

According to reports, a group of hoodlums, deceived and bought off, committed atrocities in looting these places. Even a reactionary news agency in Indonesia had to admit that the looting was "horrifying." In the areas where the persecution of overseas Chinese occurred, groups of hoodlums, numbering in the thousands or at least in the hundreds, armed with long knives and various weapons, rushed screaming towards every overseas Chinese settlement. They drove the overseas Chinese out of their homes, leaving them with only their ragged clothes or a pair of shorts, while all their other belongings were looted or destroyed.

Any resistance from the overseas Chinese resulted in brutal killings. In the village of Selurung near the border, about 100 overseas Chinese were burned alive by the hoodlums. In Manjung, more than 150 young men and women were massacred by the reactionary army with machine guns. The inhuman hoodlums did not spare the elderly and children. More than 40 overseas Chinese were brutally killed and had their hearts removed, truly inhumane and barbaric to the extreme.

This extremely barbaric massacre and persecution of overseas Chinese was orchestrated by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime under the direction and coordination of its American imperialist masters, using the most despicable and vicious means. They first deployed armed forces, staging attacks on local Dayak residents by overseas Chinese, and then used all their propaganda tools to spread lies and slander, inciting racial hatred and sowing discord between the Dayak people and the overseas Chinese.

Since the 1965 counter-revolutionary military coup, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique has already killed tens of thousands of overseas Chinese, and now it has committed such inhuman atrocities in West Kalimantan. The blood debt owed by the Indonesian reactionaries to the Chinese people must be thoroughly settled. The Indonesian fascist military regime's attempt to use the mad persecution of overseas Chinese to divert the people's attention and extinguish the flames of the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle is doomed to fail. The friendly relationship between the broad masses of overseas Chinese and the Dayak residents in West Kalimantan, which has lasted for generations, is also indestructible. The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime's inhuman fascist atrocities will inevitably spur the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia to unite more closely, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and wage an unyielding struggle to defend the dignity of their motherland, safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, and uphold the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples.

    印尼反动派疯狂迫害华侨罪责难逃
    法西斯军人政权灭绝人性的暴行必将促使广大爱国华侨进行不屈不挠的斗争
    据新华社三日讯　雅加达消息：在印尼人民革命斗争不断发展的形势下，困难重重的印尼苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权为了转移人民视线，在它的主子美帝国主义的指使和配合之下，最近对世代居住在西加里曼丹的广大爱国华侨进行了大规模的烧、杀、抢，制造了最野蛮的反华排华暴行。
    由苏哈托直接指挥西加里曼丹反动军政当局，伙同当地达亚克族反动头目掀起的这次大规模反华排华暴行，是在去年十月中旬开始的。据报道，从十月中旬到十一月中旬的一个月里，在西加里曼丹共有四十多个地区的华侨惨遭洗劫。
    据报道，被欺骗、收买的一批暴徒在洗劫这些地方的华侨时，残暴透顶，就连一家印尼的反动通讯社也不得不承认：洗劫达到了“令人毛发悚然”的地步。在发生迫害华侨暴行的地区，成群结队的暴徒，多达数千人，少则几百人不等，手执长刀和各种凶器，呼啸着，向每一个华侨聚居的地区拥去，他们所到之处，逐家逐户地把华侨赶出家门。华侨除一身破旧衣服或一条短裤外，其余财物都被洗劫一空，搬不走的都被破坏。
    华侨稍有抵抗，即遭残杀。在靠近边境的寨鲁金村，约有一百名华侨被暴徒们活活烧死。在万诸记有一百五十多名男女青少年被反动军队用机枪集体杀害。灭绝人性的暴徒连老人和小孩也不放过。四十多名华侨惨遭杀害后还被剖腹取出心脏，真是残无人性，野蛮透顶。
    这次极为野蛮的屠杀与迫害华侨的事件是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权在它的主子美帝国主义的指使和配合之下，使用极其卑鄙恶毒的手段制造出来的。它事先出动了武装部队，伪装成华侨袭击当地达亚克族居民，然后，开动他们的一切宣传工具大肆造谣污蔑，煽动种族情绪，挑拨达亚克族和华侨的友好关系。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团从一九六五年发动反革命军事政变以来，已经杀害了成千上万的华侨，这一次它又在西加里曼丹制造了如此绝灭人性的暴行，印尼反动派欠下中国人民的血债是一定要彻底清算的。印尼法西斯军人政权妄图用疯狂迫害华侨来转移人民视线，扑灭印尼人民革命斗争烈火的阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。居住在西加里曼丹的广大华侨与达亚克族居民世代相处的友好关系也是绝对破坏不了的。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的这一绝灭人性的法西斯暴行，必将促使印尼广大爱国华侨更紧密地团结起来，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，为维护祖国的尊严，维护自己正当的权益，维护中、印尼人民的友谊而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
