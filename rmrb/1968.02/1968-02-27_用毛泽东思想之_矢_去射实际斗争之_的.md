Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes.

Using the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the "target" of actual struggles

The People's Liberation Army unit stationed in the Industrial Fifth District of Hongqiao District, Tianjin, has organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to address the active thoughts of the masses, with clear focus and purpose, solving problems thoroughly, and significantly accelerating the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 26 - The People's Liberation Army stationed in the Industrial Fifth District of Hongqiao District, Tianjin, has organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to address the different situations and active thoughts of the masses in each factory during the development of the Cultural Revolution. This approach has ensured that the study classes have a clear focus, definite purpose, concentrated strength, short duration, quick results, and thorough problem-solving. The study classes are becoming better and better. Their practice once again proves that Chairman Mao's teaching that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes" is extremely wise and correct.

The Industrial Fifth District has 64 factories. The People's Liberation Army unit stationed in this district responded to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call on National Day last year to hold extensive study classes. In the two months following National Day, they organized four sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in a concentrated manner to help the revolutionary masses in various factories. These classes played a significant role in promoting revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. After the fourth session of study classes, as the revolutionary situation developed, the movements in various factories became unbalanced, and revolutionary workers had different requirements for Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Based on this situation, the support-leftist troops conducted investigations and research, and then helped the revolutionary masses in various factories to organize different types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to different problems. They took the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the seizure of complete victory in the Cultural Revolution as their overall goal. According to the different situations in various factories, they classified and arranged the organization of five types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Units that had not yet achieved revolutionary great unity held study classes focused on combating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to promote revolutionary great unity. Units that had achieved revolutionary great unity held study classes focused on solving cadre issues to promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Units that had established revolutionary committees held study classes focused on achieving ideological revolutionization to consolidate the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Units with relatively solid revolutionary three-in-one combinations held study classes to train cadres for rectifying the Party organization and strengthening Party building. Additionally, study classes were held to overcome difficulties and promote production. Various types of study classes used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and used the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the "target" of actual struggles. The district organized classes, and the factories also organized classes, with upper and lower levels coordinating and promoting each other, solving problems one by one.

Practice has proven that organizing study classes in this way has the following advantages:

First, the purpose is clear, the focus is prominent, and it can combine upper and lower levels, promote each other, and concentrate forces to fight annihilation battles. In this district's 64 factories, by early February, 14 factories had not yet achieved revolutionary great unity, mainly due to the interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The district and these factories held study classes to combat factionalism and promote revolutionary great unity. The leaders of the two factions in the Tianjin Feather and Down Processing Factory had serious antagonistic sentiments. The support-leftist troops and revolutionary workers invited the leaders of the two factions to the district-organized study class to promote revolutionary great unity. At the same time, the support-leftist troops helped the factory organize an evening study class. Both study classes focused on combating factionalism, held a joint denunciation meeting to swear off factionalism, and then studied separately, criticized and repented privately, communicated situations, and promoted each other. Therefore, the leaders of the two factions quickly overcame factionalism, eliminated barriers, and made new contributions to revolutionary great unity. The district took this live example and organized them to go to ununified units to share their experiences, expose their private thoughts, and fight privately, which not only consolidated the revolutionary great unity in this factory but also educated the broad revolutionary masses. These 14 factories, after holding study classes to combat factionalism, have all achieved revolutionary great unity.

Second, problems are concentrated, contradictions are exposed specifically and deeply, making it convenient to grasp the active thoughts with commonality, engage in close combat, and solve problems accurately with Mao Zedong Thought. In many factories in this district, the leading cadres were promoted from old workers. Some of them implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution and, after being criticized by the masses, had antagonistic sentiments towards the revolutionary masses and hesitated to come out for the revolution.

The support-leftist troops organized 14 units that had achieved revolutionary great unity but had not yet achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination to hold study classes focused on solving cadre issues. The study classes started with class education and carried out activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, deepening the cadres' understanding of the great significance of the Cultural Revolution, and correcting their attitudes towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the revolutionary masses. The party branch secretary of the Yongge Plastic Factory, Bai Guizhen, who was a worker, listened to the old workers' reports on recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness in the study class and received warm help from the factory director of the Sixth Plastic Factory, Chu Deyi. She was deeply educated, realizing that whether or not to come out for the revolution was a matter of whether or not to listen to Chairman Mao's words and a matter of revolutionary loyalty. In the study class, she severely criticized her private thoughts of wanting to throw down her burden and not do it anymore and returned to the factory to make a deep self-examination to the masses, gaining their understanding. Bai Guizhen set an example, and cadres with similar thought burdens quickly untied their thought knots and made self-examinations to the masses. In a short time, the majority of factory-level cadres in these 14 factories were liberated, and revolutionary committees were established in all of them.

Third, each session of study classes has new content and new gains, and revolutionary workers love and deepen the study classes more and more. The study classes are held session by session, solving contradictions one by one, making the study classes a long-term classroom for educating the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and promoting the revolution and work. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee in the Hongxing Paper Box Factory, there was still residual bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the committee, and there was a barrier between old and new cadres. They held a "three-in-one combination" study class for old and new cadres and mass representatives, eliminating factionalism within the committee and achieving unity. After solving this problem, there was still factionalism among the masses, and the coordination between various processes affected production. Therefore, they held a study class aimed at eliminating factionalism and achieving revolutionary great cooperation, coordinating the relationships between workshops and various processes. Once the contradictions between workshops and processes were solved, the difficulties of workshop leaders affecting production were prominently exposed. Many workshop leaders were criticized by the masses during the Cultural Revolution, had complaints and difficulties, and their revolutionary and productive enthusiasm was not fully brought into play. Therefore, they held a study class centered on overcoming difficulties, with the participation of workshop leaders. After nine days of study, the workshop leaders solved their thought problems and actively took on the dual heavy burdens of revolution and production. In this way, solving contradictions one by one, the daily production of paper boxes in the entire factory increased by one fold.

The Industrial Fifth District organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to different problems, significantly accelerating the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. All 14 units that had not yet achieved revolutionary great unity and 14 units that had not yet achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination established revolutionary committees. Thirty-seven factories trained a large number of cadres for the next step of rectifying the Party organization and strengthening Party building.

    办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。
    用毛泽东思想之“矢”  去射实际斗争之“的”
    天津红桥区工业五片支左部队，针对群众的活思想，帮助革命群众举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，中心突出，目的明确，解决问题深透，大大加速了落实毛主席最新指示的步伐
    新华社天津二十六日电　在天津市红桥区工业五片执行支左任务的人民解放军，针对各工厂无产阶级文化大革命运动发展的不同情况和群众的活思想，有的放矢地帮助革命群众举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示。这样做，学习班中心突出，目的明确，力量集中，时间短，见效快，解决问题深透。学习班越办越好。他们的实践再一次证明，毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，无比英明正确。
    红桥区工业五片共有六十四个工厂。在这个片执行支左任务的人民解放军，响应林彪副主席去年国庆节传达的毛主席大办学习班的伟大号召，在去年国庆节以后两个多月的时间里，以集中学习的方式，帮助各工厂无产阶级革命派办了四期毛泽东思想学习班，对于促进革命大联合和革命三结合起了很大作用。四期学习班办完以后，全片大部分工厂实现了革命大联合，有一半工厂实现了革命三结合。从第四期学习班结束以后，随着革命形势的发展，各厂的运动出现了不平衡的情况，革命职工对毛泽东思想学习班提出了不同的要求。根据这种情况，支左部队经过调查研究，又帮助各厂的无产阶级革命派针对不同问题，分门别类办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。他们以全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利为总目标，按照各厂的不同情况，分类安排，先后开办了五种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。尚未实现革命大联合的单位，开办了以围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性为主要内容的促进革命大联合的学习班；已经实现革命大联合的单位，开办了以解决干部问题为主要内容的促进革命三结合的学习班；已经建立革命委员会的单位，开办了以实现思想革命化为主要内容的巩固革命三结合的学习班；革命三结合比较巩固的单位，开办了为整顿党的组织，加强党的建设培训骨干的学习班；另外还开办了以克服畏难情绪为内容的抓革命促生产的学习班。各种类型的学习班，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，去射实际斗争之“的”。片上办，厂里也办，上下呼应，互相促进，一个一个地解决问题。
    实践证明，这样办学习班有如下好处：
    一、目的明确，中心突出，可以上下结合，互相促进，集中力量打歼灭战。这个片的六十四个工厂中，到二月初仍有十四个厂没有实现革命大联合，主要原因是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，片上和这些厂就举办了围剿派性，促进革命大联合的学习班。天津羽毛加工厂两派群众组织的头头对立情绪很严重，支左部队和革命工人就把两派头头请到片上举办的促进革命大联合的学习班学习，同时支左部队又帮助这个厂开办了业余学习班。两个学习班都以围歼派性为中心，一起召开声讨派性誓师大会，然后分头学习，斗私批修，互通情况，彼此促进，因此使两派的头头迅速克服了派性，消除了隔阂，共同为革命大联合作出了新贡献。片上抓住这个活样板，组织他们到未联合的单位去现身说法，亮私斗私，既巩固了这个厂的革命大联合，又教育了广大革命群众。这十四个厂经过办学习班围剿派性，都已实现了革命大联合。
    二、问题集中，暴露矛盾具体深刻，便于抓住带有共性的活思想，短兵相接，有的放矢地用毛泽东思想去解决问题。这个片许多工厂的领导干部都是由老工人提拔起来的。他们之中有些人在文化大革命初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，受到群众批判之后，同革命群众有对立情绪，迟迟不站出来革命。
    支左部队就组织十四个实现了革命大联合但尚未实现革命三结合的单位，开办了以解决干部问题为中心内容的学习班。学习班从阶级教育入手，开展忆苦思甜活动，使干部加深对无产阶级文化大革命伟大意义的理解，端正对毛主席无产阶级革命路线和对革命群众的态度。永革塑料厂工人出身的党支部书记白桂珍，在学习班里听了老工人忆苦思甜的报告，又受到第六塑料厂厂长褚德倪的热情帮助，深深受到教育，认识到站不站出来革命，就是听不听毛主席的话，对毛主席忠不忠的革命大节问题，在学习班里狠狠地批判了自己想撂挑子不干的私心杂念，并且回厂向群众作了深刻检查，取得了群众的谅解。白桂珍作出了样子，和她有同样思想包袱的干部也很快解开了思想疙瘩，向群众作了检查。在不长的时间里，十四个厂的大多数厂级干部都解放出来，全部建立了革命委员会。
    三、每期学习班都有新的内容，都有新的收获，革命职工对学习班越办越爱办，越办越深刻。学习班一期一期地办下去，矛盾一个一个地解决，使学习班成为长远用毛泽东思想教育群众，推动革命和工作的大课堂。红星纸箱厂成立革命委员会以后，在革委会里还残存着资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，新老干部之间有隔阂。他们就针对这个问题举办了新老干部和群众代表“三结合”的学习班，使革委会内部的派性消除了，达到了团结。这个问题解决了，但群众中还存在着派性，各道工序配合不好，影响了生产。于是，他们又举办了以打倒派性，实现革命大协作为目标的学习班，使班组之间、各道工序之间的关系协调了。班组、工序之间配合不好的矛盾一解决，班组长的畏难情绪影响生产的矛盾就突出地暴露出来了。不少班组长在文化大革命中被群众批评了一下，有埋怨和畏难情绪，革命和生产积极性没有充分发挥出来。于是，他们又以克服畏难情绪为中心，举办了由班组长参加的学习班。经过九天学习，班组长解决了思想问题，主动挑起了革命、生产两副重担。这样一个一个地解决矛盾，使全厂纸箱日产量提高了一倍。
    工业五片针对不同问题，有的放矢地举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大大加速了落实毛主席最新指示的步伐，使全片十四个没有实现革命大联合的单位和十四个没有实现革命三结合的单位全部建立了革命委员会，有三十七个工厂为下一步整顿党的组织，加强党的建设训练了大批骨干。
