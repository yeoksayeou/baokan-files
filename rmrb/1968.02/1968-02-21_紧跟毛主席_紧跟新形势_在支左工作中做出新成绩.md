Thousands of words surge in our hearts, hot blood boils, and tears of joy flow. On February 19, 1968, our dearest and most beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received us. This is an unforgettable great joy for us, and a great joy for the entire army and the people of the nation. Dear Chairman Mao, in this most beautiful and happiest moment, how can we not shout with joy, how can we not sing! Thousands of words, millions of words, cannot express Your boundless kindness; thousands of songs, millions of songs, cannot express our limitless admiration. Our every red heart bursts forth with a loud voice: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand long lives! Our every red heart unites into a common wish: Wish You, dear Chairman, eternal life!

Dear Chairman Mao, we are closest to You, we love You the most, we are the most loyal to You, we are the most intimate with You. Following Your great instruction, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," we entered Beijing Knitting Factory on June 26 of last year. In the process of supporting the left, we have followed Your great strategic deployment step by step and at all times, implemented Your latest instructions item by item and comprehensively, faithfully carried out the three principles of supporting the left, vigorously propagated Your great thoughts, and held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This has made the proletarian cultural revolution at Beijing Knitting Factory, under Your guidance, break waves and surge forward, achieving one great victory after another. Following the achievement of revolutionary great unity across the entire factory on September 19 of last year, we established the factory revolutionary committee on November 11.

In more than half a year, we have, through the fiery struggles of the masses, come to understand more deeply a great truth: Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Supporting the left involves many tasks, but the most important is to grasp the fundamentals. This fundamental is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, and use Your brilliant thoughts to arm the minds of the broad masses, letting Your great thoughts illuminate the entire Beijing Knitting Factory.

Dear Chairman Mao, You have taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power," "The new social system has just been established and needs a period of consolidation. It is impossible to think that the new system is completely consolidated once it is established. It needs to be gradually consolidated," "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." We understand that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the new situation poses new demands on the work of supporting the left, and our responsibilities are even greater and more glorious. We resolutely protect the revolutionary government, resolutely respect the revolutionary government, resolutely support the revolutionary government, and resolutely defend the revolutionary government. Currently, we are helping the factory revolutionary committee and various workshop leading groups to grasp the fundamentals, emphasize proletarian politics, help establish various systems for studying and applying Your brilliant works, hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fight against selfishness, criticize revisionism, continue to besiege bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, thoroughly smash anarchism, further carry out the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre, making it quickly become healthy and consolidated, truly becoming a vigorous leading cadre that is highly proletarianized and highly militant, truly becoming a revolutionary government that is forever loyal to You, forever loyal to Your brilliant thoughts, and forever loyal to Your proletarian revolutionary line.

Dear Chairman Mao, we are forever infinitely loyal to You. To Your latest instructions, we will definitely act immediately, follow closely, implement item by item, and comprehensively. We will definitely be more humble, cautious, and learn from the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the model Li Wenzhong. We will learn from the broad masses of workers, and do the glorious work of supporting the left, which You have entrusted to us, even better. Together with the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of Beijing Knitting Factory, we will turn the entire factory into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Long live! Ten thousand long lives!"

    紧跟毛主席　紧跟新形势
    在支左工作中做出新成绩
    八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员
    千言万语涌心头，热血沸腾喜泪流。一九六八年二月十九日，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见了我们，这是我们终生难忘的特大的喜事，是全军和全国人民特大的喜事。敬爱的毛主席呀，在这最美好、最幸福的时刻里，我们怎能不欢呼，我们怎能不歌唱！千言万语，万语千言，说不尽您海洋般的恩情；千歌万曲，万曲千歌，唱不尽我们对您的无限崇拜。我们颗颗红心迸发出一个宏亮的声音：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！我们颗颗红心凝结成一个共同的愿望：祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！
    敬爱的毛主席呀，我们离您最近，我们爱您最深，我们对您最忠，我们和您最亲。我们遵照您老人家“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大教导，于去年六月二十六日进驻北京针织总厂。在支左过程中，我们步步紧跟、时时紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，条条落实、全面落实您老人家的最新指示，忠实地贯彻执行支左工作的三项原则，大力宣传您老人家的伟大思想，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，使针织总厂的无产阶级文化大革命运动沿着您老人家指引的方向乘风破浪，高歌猛进，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。继去年九月十九日全厂实现了革命大联合之后，又于十一月十一日建立了厂革命委员会。
    半年多来，我们从火热的群众斗争中，更加深刻地认识到一个伟大的真理：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。支左，有很多工作要做，但最最重要的是狠抓根本，这个根本，就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，走突出无产阶级政治的路，用您老人家的光辉思想去武装广大群众的头脑，让您老人家的伟大思想的光辉照亮整个针织总厂。
    敬爱的毛主席呀，您老人家教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”，“新的社会制度还刚刚建立，还需要有一个巩固的时间。不能认为新制度一旦建立起来就完全巩固了，那是不可能的。需要逐步地巩固”，“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦”。我们认识到，革命委员会建立之后，新的形势对支左工作提出了新的要求，我们的责任更加重大和光荣。我们坚决爱护革命政权，坚决尊重革命政权，坚决支持革命政权，坚决保卫革命政权。当前，我们正帮助厂革命委员会和各车间领导小组狠抓根本，突出无产阶级政治，帮助建立活学活用您的光辉著作的各项制度，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗私，猛批修，继续围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，彻底打倒无政府主义，进一步搞好领导班子的思想革命化，使它迅速得到健全和巩固，真正成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的朝气蓬勃的领导班子，真正成为永远忠于您、永远忠于您的光辉思想、永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线的革命政权。
    敬爱的毛主席呀，我们永远无限忠于您，对您老人家的最新指示，我们一定闻风而动，步步紧跟，句句照办，条条落实，全面落实。我们一定更加谦虚、谨慎，虚心向“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志学习，向广大工人同志学习，把您老人家交给我们的光荣的支左工作做得好上加好，和针织总厂广大的革命干部、革命群众一起，把全厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
