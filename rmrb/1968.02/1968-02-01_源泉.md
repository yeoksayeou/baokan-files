The island has not seen rain for three or four months, and most wells have dried up. One day, soldier Liang Bofu went down the mountain to fetch water and was spotted by militia squad leader Liu Yinguang. He thought: Usually, the PLA goes down the mountain to fetch water and brings it to the village. Today, they are carrying it up the mountain, which must mean the water source on the mountain slope has dried up. The entire village is worried about this, thinking: The PLA lives on the mountain slope, and their water supply must be very difficult.

The next day, before dawn, the loudspeaker at the entrance of Xiagang Village broadcast as usual: "Fellow villagers! Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything.' Today's task is to deliver water to the PLA." As soon as the broadcast ended, the entire village, young and old, men and women, sprang into action, forming groups to go up the mountain to deliver water. Grandpa Chen Jinmu heard the broadcast and hurriedly got out of bed, but his water buckets had been taken by his son, so he had to borrow from his neighbors. He thought: If I can't borrow buckets, I'll carry water up the mountain with basins. After borrowing from several households, he finally got a pair of buckets. He carried a full load of water up the mountain.

The soldiers, seeing the villagers bringing water up the mountain, were moved and quickly went forward to greet them. Soon, the large pots in the kitchen, the iron woks, and the basins from each class and squad were all filled with water. The soldiers excitedly said: "Our army and people are like fish and water, the people are the true source of our strength."

    源泉
    岛上已经三四个月没有下雨了，多数水井都干了。这天，战士梁伯福下山挑水，正好被民兵排长刘银官看见了。他想：往常解放军下山挑水都往村里送，今天往山上挑，一定是山腰的水井断源了。全村群众都操心这件事，他们想：解放军住在半山腰，吃水一定很困难。
    第二天，天还没亮，下广桥村头照例响起了土广播：“乡亲们！毛主席教导我们，‘没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切’。今天的任务是给解放军送水。”话音刚落，整个村子里男女老少闻风而动，成群结队上山送水。陈金木大爷听到广播急忙起床，可是家里的一担水桶被儿子挑走了，只好向邻居借。他想：借不到桶，用盆端也要端几盆水上山。借了好几家，才借到一担桶。他担上满满一担水送到山上。
    战士见乡亲们送水上山，激动得急忙向前迎接。一会儿，伙房的大桶、铁锅和各班排的脸盆全装满了水。战士们激动地说：“咱军民鱼水相依，群众才是我们力量的真正的源泉。”
