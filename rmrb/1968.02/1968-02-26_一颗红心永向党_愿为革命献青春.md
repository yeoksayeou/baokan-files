A heart ever loyal to the Party, ready to devote youth to the revolution
	Platoon Leader Peng Zuxun, Squad Leader Jin Keban

The Chinese Khrushchev uses the language of cowards to preach a set of "survival philosophy," which is nothing but the philosophy of traitors. It must be thoroughly smashed.

Chairman Mao says: "To struggle means to make sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the sufferings of the majority of the people. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai." Huang Jiguang, for the revolution, used his body to block the gun port. Dong Cunrui, for the revolution, sacrificed himself to blow up the fortress. Liu Huilan, for the revolution, faced the enemy's butcher knife with an unchanging expression, bravely sacrificing herself. Although the martyrs have sacrificed themselves, their spirits will forever stay in our hearts, inspiring us to move forward. The sole value of life is to struggle for the revolution to the end. For the Chinese revolution, for the world revolution, for the early liberation of the oppressed and exploited people, even if we sacrifice ourselves, it is glorious. Those who are afraid of death and cherish life will never be able to become revolutionary fighters.

We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from the heroes, and walk the path of the heroes. We swear to Chairman Mao: With the Red Book in hand and the gun on the shoulder, we march onto the battlefield with high spirits; a heart ever loyal to the Party, ready to devote youth to the revolution!

    一颗红心永向党  愿为革命献青春

    中国赫鲁晓夫用怕死鬼的语言鼓吹一套“活命哲学”，也就是叛徒哲学，必须把它彻底砸烂。
    毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”黄继光为革命，用身体堵枪眼。董存瑞为革命，舍身炸碉堡。刘胡兰为革命，在敌人屠刀下，脸不改色，英勇就义。烈士们虽然牺牲了，他们的精神却永远留在我们心里，鼓舞着我们前进。生命的唯一价值是为革命奋斗到底。为了中国革命，为了世界革命，为了早日解放受压迫受剥削的人民，即使牺牲了，也是光荣的。贪生怕死，就不可能当一名革命战士。
    我们决心听毛主席的话，向英雄们学习，走英雄们的道路。我们向毛主席宣誓：拿起红书扛起枪，斗志昂扬上战场；一颗红心永向党，愿为革命献青春！
