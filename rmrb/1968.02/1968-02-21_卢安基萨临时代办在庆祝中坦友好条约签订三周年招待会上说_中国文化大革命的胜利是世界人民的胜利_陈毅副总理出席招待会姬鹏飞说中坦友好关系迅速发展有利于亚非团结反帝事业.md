Tanzanian Charge d'Affaires Luangikisa, at the reception celebrating the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Tanzanian Friendship Treaty, said that the Tanzanian people wholeheartedly support the Chinese people's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao. The victory of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is our victory, and it is also the victory of all African peoples and all the peoples of the world. This great victory strikes a blow at all reactionaries and makes the imperialists and neo-colonialists struggle desperately.

Vice Premier Chen Yi and relevant officials Qi Pengfei, Ding Xilin, Xie Huai-de, and others were invited to attend the reception.

Luangikisa, the Charge d'Affaires, said in his speech that the Tanzanian people are true brothers and friends of the Chinese people. The friendship between our two countries is very deep, and this friendship will forever be solidly maintained. Our enemies do not want our friendship to last forever. They do not want the Tanzanian people and the Chinese people to be friends. However, as long as our two countries unite, we will certainly defeat these enemies. As the great teacher and wise leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All the people of the world, unite! Oppose the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, be courageous and dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and press on! Then, the whole world will certainly belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed."

Luangikisa, the Charge d'Affaires, thanked the Chinese people and the Chinese government for their brotherly and friendly aid to Tanzania. He said that this aid makes our enemies very anxious. The enemies have fabricated all kinds of lies, but all this is in vain and only exposes their meanness and absurdity. He said that we must firmly believe in the teachings of the great teacher, wise leader, and commander of the people, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrible, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

When talking about the Tanzanian people building the country according to the spirit of the Arusha Declaration, Luangikisa, the Charge d'Affaires, said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "On what basis should we set our policy? On the basis of our own strength, which means self-reliance." The Tanzanian people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, are taking measures to lay a solid foundation for economic independence, so that we can be self-reliant.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qi Pengfei said in his speech that the rapid development of friendly cooperation between China and Tanzania reflects the common aspirations of the peoples of our two countries. It not only serves the common interests of the peoples of our two countries but also benefits the cause of Asian-African unity and anti-imperialism. It also sets a good example for solidarity and cooperation among Asian-African countries.

Qi Pengfei praised Tanzania's efforts and achievements in maintaining national independence and developing the national economy under the leadership of President Nyerere, inspired by the spirit of self-reliance in the Arusha Declaration. He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty.' 'The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world are mutually supportive.' China's aid to Tanzania is very limited. In the anti-imperialist struggle, we have also received the support of the Tanzanian people. The Chinese people, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will more effectively support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries and better fulfill our internationalist duties."

After the reception, a documentary film about the Arusha Declaration was screened.

    卢安基萨临时代办在庆祝中坦友好条约签订三周年招待会上说
    中国文化大革命的胜利是世界人民的胜利
    陈毅副总理出席招待会姬鹏飞说中坦友好关系迅速发展有利于亚非团结反帝事业
    新华社二十日讯　坦桑尼亚驻中国大使馆临时代办卢安基萨，今天在他举行的庆祝坦桑尼亚和中国友好条约签订三周年的招待会上说，坦桑尼亚人民全心全意地支持中国人民在英明领袖毛主席亲自领导下进行的无产阶级文化大革命。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利就是我们的胜利，也是全体非洲人民和全世界人民的胜利。这伟大的胜利打击了所有的反动派，使帝国主义和新殖民主义者绝望地挣扎。
    国务院副总理陈毅和有关方面负责人姬鹏飞、丁西林、谢怀德等，应邀出席了招待会。
    卢安基萨临时代办在讲话中说，坦桑尼亚人民是中国人民的真正兄弟和朋友，我们两国之间的友谊是非常深厚的，这种友谊将会永远巩固地存在下去。我们的敌人不愿意我们的友谊永远存在下去，他们不愿意坦桑尼亚人民和中国人民成为朋友，但是，只要我们两国团结起来，就必将战胜这些敌人。正如伟大的导师、英明的领袖毛主席教导我们的那样：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    卢安基萨临时代办感谢中国人民和中国政府对坦桑尼亚提供的兄弟般友好的援助。他说，这些援助使我们的敌人非常恐慌，敌人制造了种种谎言，但是这一切都是徒劳的挣扎，只会暴露他们的卑劣和荒唐。他说，我们必须对伟大的导师、英明的领袖、人民的统帅毛主席的教导坚信不移，毛主席教导我们说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    卢安基萨临时代办在谈到坦桑尼亚人民正根据《阿鲁沙宣言》精神进行国家建设时说，毛主席教导说：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”坦桑尼亚人民根据毛主席的教导，正在采取措施，使我们在经济上打下独立自主的牢固基础，能够自力更生。
    外交部副部长姬鹏飞在讲话中说，中国、坦桑尼亚友好合作关系的迅速发展，反映了我们两国人民的共同愿望，它不仅符合我们两国人民的共同利益，也有利于亚非团结反帝事业，并且为亚非国家之间的团结合作树立了良好的范例。
    姬鹏飞赞扬了坦桑尼亚在尼雷尔总统领导下，在《阿鲁沙宣言》自力更生的精神鼓舞下，为维护民族独立发展民族经济所作的努力和取得的显著成就。他说，我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”中国对坦桑尼亚的援助是很有限的，在反帝斗争中，我们也得到坦桑尼亚人民的支持。中国人民经过无产阶级文化大革命，将更有效地支援世界各国人民的革命斗争，更好地完成我们所应尽的国际主义义务。
    招待会以后放映了坦桑尼亚的关于《阿鲁沙宣言》的纪录影片。
