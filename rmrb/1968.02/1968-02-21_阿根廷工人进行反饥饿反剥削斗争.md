Sugar industry workers in the main sugar-producing regions of Argentina, such as Tucumán, continue to persist in their struggle against the reactionary economic policies of the pro-American dictatorial regime of Onganía.

Since the beginning of the year, the Onganía government, mired in economic difficulties, has closed down numerous sugar mills, laid off workers, and reduced wages, severely threatening the livelihoods of sugar industry workers in several northern provinces of Argentina. Workers in this region have been waging fierce struggles against hunger and exploitation.

    阿根廷工人进行反饥饿反剥削斗争
    阿根廷的主要产糖地区图库曼等省的糖业工人，继续坚持反对翁加尼亚亲美独裁政府反动经济政策的斗争。
    年初以来，陷于经济困境的翁加尼亚政府根据美国控制的国际货币基金组织的意图，大批关闭糖厂，解雇工人，降低工人工资，严重地威胁着阿根廷北方数省糖业工人的生存。这个地区的糖业工人一直进行着激烈的反饥饿、反剥削斗争。
