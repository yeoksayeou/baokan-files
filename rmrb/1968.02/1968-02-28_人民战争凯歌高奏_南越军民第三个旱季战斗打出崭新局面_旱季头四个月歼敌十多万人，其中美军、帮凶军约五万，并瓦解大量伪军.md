The people's war is triumphant. The military and civilians of South Vietnam have achieved a new situation in their third dry season battles. In the first four months of the dry season, they annihilated over ten thousand enemy troops, including approximately fifty thousand American and puppet soldiers, and dissolved a large number of puppet forces.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 25th, our correspondent reports: Since last October, the military and civilians of South Vietnam, with high morale, have advanced victorious, "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat." On various battlefields, especially in the important strongholds of the American and puppet clique, they launched fierce attacks on the enemy, making the enemy disorganized and achieving a completely new situation. This has created more favorable conditions for winning greater victories.

Since the end of 1965, when the American aggressors took off their shirts and entered the battlefield in South Vietnam, the military and civilians of South Vietnam have directly confronted them in two dry seasons (from winter 1965 to spring 1966; from winter 1966 to spring 1967). In these two dry seasons, the U.S. imperialists' "dry season counteroffensive" strategies all started with great momentum but ended in defeat. However, the unrepentant American bandits, unwilling to accept defeat, placed their hopes in the third dry season, attempting to annihilate the main forces of the people's liberation army. However, the result was the opposite, and their plots were thoroughly foiled, leading to even more severe defeats.

The intensity of the offensive and the number of enemies annihilated are unprecedented. According to incomplete statistics, the military and civilians of South Vietnam have annihilated over ten thousand enemy troops in the past four months of battles, including approximately fifty thousand American aggressors and puppet soldiers, and dissolved a large number of puppet forces. This number of enemies annihilated far exceeds the total in the first dry season from 1965 to 1966.

The third dry season is a season of triumph for the military and civilians of South Vietnam. In the first four months of the dry season, the intensity of their offensives and the number of enemies annihilated are unprecedented in the South Vietnamese battlefield. They first launched fierce attacks on several strategic strongholds heavily guarded by the enemy in October and November last year, disrupting the enemy's formations. Then, they continued to charge and fight fiercely in December last year and January this year, especially launching a fierce and sustained Tet Offensive at the end of January, striking the American troops into a state of panic, causing many puppet forces to collapse, making the puppet regime unstable, and causing the American ruling clique to fall into chaos. Thus, they pushed the offensive against the enemy since the dry season to a new high, elevating the Vietnamese people's war to a high level.

The new victories of the military and civilians of South Vietnam once again proved the wise judgment of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

The military and political forces have developed rapidly. The brilliant achievements of the past four months indicate that the military and political forces of the military and civilians of South Vietnam have developed rapidly. From the southern bank of the Ben Hai River to Cape Ca Mau, from the highlands to the plains, from rural areas to cities, the military and civilians of South Vietnam have continuously and successfully organized a series of powerful offensives on a vast battlefield, making the enemy completely lose the initiative, and then leading the enemy by the nose to fight fiercely. During this period, especially since the launch of the Tet Offensive, the people's armed forces have widely mobilized the masses, firmly relied on the masses, and strived to win over patriotic officers and soldiers in the puppet forces, rapidly expanding their own strength and further isolating the enemy. In new rural liberated areas, the militia and guerrilla forces have developed more broadly; in cities, self-defense forces and armed forces have also rapidly grown. The "pacification" plans repeatedly boasted by the American and puppet clique have been shattered, and large areas of land have been liberated. The liberated areas have extended to the suburbs near Saigon.

The new victories of the military and civilians of South Vietnam have completely disrupted the U.S. military deployments, causing chaos in their defensive formations. The military and civilians of South Vietnam have launched widespread attacks in rural areas and cities, especially in the enemy's heartland and various air bases, turning the enemy's so-called "safe" rear into the frontline of fierce battles, leaving the enemy with no safe place to hide. The American aggressors, while being attacked everywhere and struggling to cope, had to withdraw some of the troops originally dispersed in various "pacification" fronts back to the cities, attempting to defend their strongholds, thus falling into an even more passive and chaotic predicament.

In the battles, the military and civilians of South Vietnam creatively applied the flexible strategies and tactics of people's war. In the first three months, they launched attacks and sieges on many important strongholds of the enemy in the mountains, attracting a large number of enemy troops, while the enemy focused on these areas, they continuously and widely launched surprise attacks on the enemy's rear strongholds, catching the enemy off guard.

The past three dry seasons have consumed about four hundred thousand enemy troops. The past four months of the South Vietnamese battlefield have proven beyond doubt that the U.S. imperialists and their South Vietnamese puppets, who have suffered heavy blows, are in a worse situation with each passing dry season, and their days are getting tougher. The ruthless U.S. imperialists have once again exposed their paper tiger nature on the South Vietnamese battlefield.

Last October, shortly after entering the dry season, the American aggressors were completely in a passive and defensive situation. In just the first two months of the dry season, the number of American and puppet troops annihilated reached over forty thousand, with American troops and mercenaries accounting for about twenty thousand. This year, the American and puppet troops have been even more overwhelmed, unable to defend themselves, and suffering repeated defeats. According to statistics, the elite forces of the American and puppet troops were annihilated by the brave military and civilians of South Vietnam, with eleven thousand annihilated in the first dry season, and over seventeen thousand in the second dry season; now, in just over four months of the third dry season, they have suffered another loss of over ten thousand. The morale of the American and puppet troops is declining day by day, and the puppet regime is shaking more and more.

The new victories of the military and civilians of South Vietnam have greatly boosted the morale of the world's revolutionary people and severely damaged the prestige of U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. The fourteen million military and civilians of South Vietnam have used their guns to create an unprecedentedly good situation.

    人民战争凯歌高奏
    南越军民第三个旱季战斗打出崭新局面
    旱季头四个月歼敌十多万人，其中美军、帮凶军约五万，并瓦解大量伪军
    据新华社二十五日讯　本社记者报道：自去年十月进入同美国侵略军直接较量的第三个旱季战斗以来，斗志昂扬的越南南方军民乘胜前进，“横扫千军如卷席”。他们在各个战场上，特别是在美伪集团后方的重要巢穴里猛袭敌人，打得敌人狼狈不堪，打出了完全崭新的局面，为进一步夺取更大的胜利创造了更有利的条件。
    自从美国侵略军一九六五年底在南越战场赤膊上阵以来，南越军民已经同它直接较量了两个旱季（从一九六五年冬到一九六六年春；从一九六六年冬到一九六七年春）。在这两个旱季中，美帝国主义的一次次“旱季战略反攻”，都以气势汹汹开始，以惨败告终。但是，贼心不死的美国强盗并不甘心失败，又把希望寄托在第三个旱季，妄图消灭人民解放武装的主力，然而结果适得其反，他们的阴谋遭到了彻底的破产，他们的失败更加惨重。
    攻势之猛，歼敌之多前所未有
    据不完全统计，南越军民在最近四个月的战斗中已经歼灭敌军十多万人，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军约五万人，另外还瓦解了大量伪军。这个歼敌数字大大超过了在一九六五——一九六六年第一个旱季七个月中歼敌的总和。
    第三个旱季是南越军民凯歌高奏的旱季。他们在旱季头四个月中攻势之猛，歼敌之多，都是南越战场上前所未有的。他们首先在去年十、十一两个月中猛袭敌人重兵把守的一些战略据点，打乱了敌人的阵脚，然后，又一鼓作气，在去年十二月份和今年一月份里继续猛冲猛打，特别是在一月底发动了凌厉而持续的新春攻势，打得美军丧魂落魄，打得很多地方的伪军溃不成军，打得伪政权东歪西倒，打得美国统治集团乱成一团，从而把旱季以来对敌人的进攻推向一个新高潮，把越南人民战争发展到了一个高度水平。
    南越军民的新胜利又一次证明了伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    武装力量和政治力量获得飞速发展
    四个多月来的辉煌战果表明，南越军民武装力量和政治力量获得了飞速的发展。从边海河南岸到金瓯角，从高原到平原，从农村到城市，南越军民在广阔的战场上，持续地、成功地组织了一系列强大的攻势，使敌人完全失去主动，然后牵着敌人的鼻子狠打。在这期间，特别是发动新春攻势以来，由于人民武装力量广泛发动了群众，坚决依靠群众，努力争取伪军中的爱国官兵，从而迅速地壮大了自己的力量，进一步孤立了敌人。在新的农村解放区，民兵和游击队获得了更广泛的发展；在城市，自卫队和武装力量也迅速成长起来。美伪集团一再吹嘘的“绥靖”计划被粉碎，大片河山获得了解放。解放区一直伸延到紧靠西贡的市郊。
    南越军民的新胜利，完全打乱了美帝的军事部署，搞乱了它的防御阵势。南越军民在农村和城市，尤其是在敌人的心脏地区和各个空军基地广泛出击，把敌人视为“安全”的后方，变为激战的前线，打得敌人连一块安全藏身之地都没有。美国侵略者在到处挨打，顾此失彼的情况下，不得不把一些原来分散在各个“绥靖”前线的兵力撤回城市，力图守住巢穴，从而陷入了更加被动混乱的困境。
    南越军民在战斗中创造性地运用了人民战争机动灵活的战略战术。他们在前三个月中，向山区敌人许多重要据点，发动了袭击和进行围困，吸引了敌人的大量兵力，而当敌人集中注意这些地区的时候，连续地、广泛地奇袭敌人后方的巢穴，打得敌人措手不及。
    近三个旱季吃掉敌军四十万左右
    南越战场四个多月来无可辩驳的事实证明，遭到沉重打击的美帝国主义和它的南越走狗的处境，一个旱季不如一个旱季，日子越来越不好过。穷凶极恶的美帝国主义，在南越战场上又一次露出了纸老虎的原形。
    去年十月，刚进入旱季不久，美国侵略者就完全陷入了被动挨打的困境中。仅在旱季的头两个月中，被歼的美伪军就达到四万多名，其中美军和帮凶军约占两万名。今年以来，美伪军更是穷于应付，无法招架，一败再败。据统计，美伪军的精锐兵力在第一个旱季中，被英勇的南越军民消灭了十一万名，到了第二个旱季，又被吃掉了十七万多；而现在，第三个旱季刚过了四个多月，又损失十多万。美伪军士气日益低落，伪政权更加摇摇欲坠。
    南越军民的新胜利，大长世界革命人民志气，大灭美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。一千四百万南越军民用枪杆子打出了空前大好的形势。
