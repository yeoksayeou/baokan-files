Guangdong Province's proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses are focusing on the fundamentals, holding extensive study classes to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many prefectures, counties, and cities have achieved revolutionary great unity or reached agreements on revolutionary great unity, establishing revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory groups.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 16th - Guangdong Province is holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and driving the tide of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination forward across the province.

Currently, from the Nanling Mountains to the Wuzhishan Mountains, from the Chaozhou and Shantou plains to the Pearl River Delta, the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in urban and rural areas across Guangdong Province is unprecedentedly good and getting better. Among the 107 counties and cities in the province, 90 have achieved revolutionary great unity or reached agreements on revolutionary great unity. Among the 8 prefectures in the province, 7 have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and a large number of counties and cities have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary committee preparatory groups.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the 40 million heroic sons and daughters of Guangdong Province, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, sprang into action, swiftly and decisively launching a mass movement to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In just a few months, from cities to rural areas, from mountain regions to fishing ports, from factory workshops to production teams, from government agencies, schools to neighborhoods, the province has held over 40,000 study classes of various types, with nearly 6 million people participating in the studies. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes across the region have promoted the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, ensuring that learning and application go hand in hand, with immediate results. Revolutionary masses have elevated the struggle between public and private interests, between proletarian party spirit and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, to the level of a struggle between two lines, to the level of whether to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have resolutely launched a revolution in their souls, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois "self," firmly establishing the proletarian "public," eliminating factionalism, and strengthening party spirit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The study classes held in Guangdong Province, based on the development of the proletarian cultural revolution, have focused on the main issues of each period, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon and "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, seriously addressing these issues. They have successively held study classes centered on promoting revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, achieving immediate results. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes jointly held by the two factions in various places in Guangdong, the leaders and masses of the two factions sit together to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fight selfishness and criticize revisionism together, jointly combat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, thoroughly expose the harm of factionalism, thoroughly count the crimes of factionalism, and thoroughly uproot the source of factionalism. Many opposing mass organizations have achieved revolutionary great unity on the spot or reached agreements to achieve revolutionary great unity. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various places in Guangdong have organized proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and consistent teachings on cadre issues, and have held specialized study classes to solve cadre issues. Proletarian revolutionaries have strengthened ideological and political work among cadres, using great Mao Zedong Thought to educate cadres to correctly treat themselves and correctly treat the masses, helping batch after batch of cadres to bravely step forward.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various places in Guangdong generally start with situation education and class education, inspiring and arousing the participants' boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and their concern for the revolutionary situation. They seriously study, deeply understand, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In situation education, they use the method of "one display, two observations, three comparisons," that is, displaying one's own active thoughts, observing the great situation nationwide, provincially, and within the unit, and using Chairman Mao's latest instructions to compare and examine oneself. In class education, they generally use the method of "three remembrances and three observations," that is, remembering the bitterness of the old society and observing the sweetness of the new society; remembering the harm of the bourgeois reactionary line and observing the great correctness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; remembering the glorious revolutionary traditions and observing one's performance in the cultural revolution. Through these activities, the broad revolutionary masses love the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought even more; they hate the Chinese Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line even more, powerfully promoting revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and driving the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units to be carried out more deeply.

    广东省无产阶级革命派和革命群众狠抓根本
    大办学习班全面落实毛主席最新指示
    许多专、县、市实现了革命大联合或达成革命大联合协议，成立了革命委员会或革筹小组
    据新华社广州十六日电　广东省大办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示，推动全省革命大联合和革命三结合洪流奔腾向前。
    目前，广东省从南岭到五指山，从潮汕平原到珠江三角洲，广大城乡无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好，越来越好。全省一百零七个县、市中，已有九十个县、市实现了革命大联合或达成革命大联合协议；全省八个专区中，已有七个专区成立了革命委员会或革命委员会筹备小组，还有一大批县、市成立了革命委员会或革命委员会筹备小组。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，无限忠于毛主席的广东省四千万英雄儿女，闻风而动，雷厉风行，掀起了大办毛泽东思想学习班的群众运动。在短短的几个月中，从城镇到农村，从山区到渔港，从工厂车间到生产队，从机关、学校到街道，全省已经举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班四万多期，参加学习的人数近六百万人。各地毛泽东思想学习班，大兴毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，切实做到学用结合，学了就用，立竿见影。革命群众把公与私的斗争，无产阶级党性与资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的斗争，提到两条路线斗争的高度，提到是否紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的高度，坚决地在灵魂深处爆发革命，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，打倒派性，增强党性。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”广东省举办的学习班，根据无产阶级文化大革命运动发展的情况，抓住各个时期的主要问题，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，加以认真解决。他们先后举办了以促进革命大联合、革命三结合等为中心内容的学习班，取得了立竿见影的效果。在广东各地两派群众组织联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班里，两派头头和群众坐在一起活学活用毛泽东思想，一起斗私批修，一起围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，大揭派性的危害，大数派性的罪状，大挖派性的根子，许多对立的群众组织当场实现了革命大联合或达成实现革命大联合的协议。广东各地的毛泽东思想学习班组织无产阶级革命派和革命群众反复学习毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示和一贯教导，并举办了专门解决干部问题的学习班。无产阶级革命派大力加强对干部的思想政治工作，用伟大的毛泽东思想教育干部正确对待自己，正确对待群众，帮助一批又一批干部勇敢地站出来。
    广东省各地的毛泽东思想学习班，普遍注意从形势教育和阶级教育入手，鼓舞和激发学员胸怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，胸怀革命大局，认真地学习、深刻地领会、不折不扣地执行毛主席的最新指示。在形势教育中，他们采用了“一摆，二看，三对照”的办法，即摆自己的活思想，看全国、全省、本单位的大好形势，用毛主席的最新指示对照检查自己。在阶级教育中，普遍采用了“三忆三看”的方法，就是忆旧社会的苦，看新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线之害，看毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大正确；忆革命的光荣传统，看自己在文化大革命中的表现。通过这些活动，使广大革命群众更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加热爱伟大的毛泽东思想；更加仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫及其推行的反革命修正主义路线，有力地促进了革命大联合和革命三结合，推动各单位斗批改更加深入开展。
