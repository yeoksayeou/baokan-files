The more than twenty factories and enterprises in the Taopu District of Shanghai have, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped the correct direction of struggle. They have not participated in the factional struggles of other districts. Since March of last year, these factories have successively achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Revolutionary struggle has promoted production development. Many factories not only completed and overfulfilled their production plans but also successfully developed several important new products and carried out numerous technological innovations.

Strengthening Party spirit, resisting factionalism, and relying on the power of the revolutionary masses to maintain the correct direction of struggle

The proletarian revolutionary masses in this district have long placed great learning and great criticism at the forefront of all work, directing their fire at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Over the past year, they have criticized the capitalist line, the revisionist industrial line, and the revisionist party line, step by step deepening the great criticism. They not only organized district-wide criticism and struggle meetings but also united with the local poor and lower-middle peasants to jointly criticize and struggle against Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, eliminating their poisonous influence and further strengthening worker-peasant unity. Their battle cry is: Let great learning and great criticism occupy all positions. Seeing "internal war" slogans and big-character posters, they cover them with great learning and great criticism slogans and big-character posters. Common enemy struggles greatly promoted the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in each factory.

This district is in the midst of the fierce "internal war" in the Putuo District. To shake off external influences, eliminate various interferences, and maintain the correct direction of revolutionary struggle, the proletarian revolutionary masses in these factories and enterprises, after repeated consultations, specially formulated a joint code of conduct. They stipulated that revolutionary mass organizations in each factory should learn from and support each other, opposing the practice of one faction attacking another; when conflicts arise, they should be resolved through consultation and discussion, and not through fighting, looting, and arson; they should not unilaterally align with other districts, nor should they participate in the factional struggles of other districts; they should not post or distribute "internal war" leaflets from other districts, etc. Based on this principle, in addition to actively participating in the revolutionary actions to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, they resolutely refused to participate in the "internal war" of other districts and units, thereby also avoiding the impact of factional struggles from other districts and units. Once, they were deceived into participating in a "revolutionary action" at a certain place. Upon arriving at the scene and clarifying the facts, they immediately withdrew their troops. Another time, some people from an outside unit rushed into this district to attack a factory. They immediately sent representatives to persuade the outside unit to withdraw their troops. For doing so, they were criticized as "two-faced" and "isolated," but they paid no heed and acted according to proletarian party spirit, firmly implementing what is in line with Mao Zedong Thought and firmly resisting what is not.

They also took it upon themselves to promote the unity of each factory and organization in opposing the enemy. When one factory faced a stalemate between two factions, and when a few organizations in another factory had intensified conflicts and sought support, they did not readily take sides. Instead, they conducted thorough investigations and research to understand the situation of these organizations and then helped these organizations study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together. Under their active, enthusiastic, patient, and meticulous guidance and help, after criticizing and repudiating their selfishness and revisionism, they finally achieved revolutionary great unity in these two factories.

Holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on ideological and political work, and correctly handling contradictions among the people

The proletarian revolutionary masses in this district attach great importance to the study of Chairman Mao's works and the prompt implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They focus on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, inspiring the masses to love Chairman Mao even more and to be even more loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Since June of last year, they have started holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the basis of regular study sessions. Almost all workers in each factory have attended Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and even the workers' residential area of Taopu New Village has set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through criticizing and repudiating their selfishness and revisionism in the study classes, combined with meticulous ideological and political work, they further organized and educated the class ranks, united the majority of the masses and cadres, and concentrated their efforts on attacking a handful of class enemies. The Eighth Dyeing and Chemical Factory focused on ideological and political work, helping many comrades who had previously taken the wrong side to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A leader of a rebel faction, together with some comrades, did ideological and political work with a young worker in their factory who had participated in the conservative organization Red Guards, a total of twenty times. Through repeated education on the struggle between the two lines, they finally made this young worker voluntarily hand over the Red Guards flag he had hidden for half a year. Later, he also joined the rebel faction. To help class brothers who had previously taken the wrong side eliminate hostile sentiments, many factories held several study classes targeting these people. The leader of the rebel faction of the Second Pharmaceutical Factory patiently mobilized these people to attend the study classes and explained the significance to the masses, mobilizing the masses to do the work together. Some people attended the study classes with a "being criticized" attitude and refused to speak. The revolutionary masses enthusiastically encouraged them to speak and studied Chairman Mao's works with them, conducting class education of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, helping them find the root of their wrong stance in the struggle between the two lines. Most people, through study, untangled their ideological knots, and their political awareness improved rapidly. Many revolutionary rebel faction leaders in factories and enterprises are also good at listening to different opinions, treating criticisms and suggestions from revolutionary masses as an important source for examining and supervising their leadership work and promoting their ideological transformation. Because ideological and political work is done thoroughly and meticulously, the relationship between the revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses, the relationship between old and new cadres, and the relationship between cadres and the masses in most factories and enterprises are handled relatively well. Party-mass relations have also been significantly improved.

Promoting the advanced, carrying out comparative learning and mutual aid activities, and continuously advancing the revolution

The proletarian revolutionary masses in this district understand that revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination must be continuously consolidated and developed in revolutionary struggles. Therefore, whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, and whenever the Cultural Revolution enters a new stage, they take promoting the advanced, setting up models, and leading by example as an important method to promote the development of the movement in this district.

In their work, they are good at timely discovering the advanced experiences of units in other districts and inviting units from outside to share their experiences, making the advanced experiences take root and blossom in this district. When the Cultural Revolution deepened and the broad revolutionary masses urgently needed to further grasp the weapons of Mao Zedong Thought, they invited the poor and lower-middle peasants from Hengsha Island to share their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; when the mass movement of studying Mao Zedong's party-building theories and criticizing Khrushchev's revisionist party line began, they invited comrades from Shanghai Radio Factory, who had taken the lead, to share their experiences; when the extreme "leftist" trend of smashing, looting, and arson swept through society, they invited comrades from Shanghai Ink Factory to share their experiences in combining criticism and struggle with reform in their own units. The Eighth Company of Nanjing Road created good experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle in Taopu Chemical Factory, and they organized the rebel factions of each factory to go and learn from them.

At the same time, they also paid attention to discovering and summarizing advanced seeds in the struggle between the two lines in this district, promptly promoting and exchanging them to lead a wave. The Eighth Dyeing and Chemical Factory held Mao Zedong Thought study classes early and had a good method (bringing problems into the class for study, revealing thoughts, criticizing and repudiating selfishness and revisionism, grasping one point to summarize experiences, and returning to the department to lead a wave), and they promoted this factory to summarize and introduce, making each factory hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The Sixth Pharmaceutical Factory's work of rectifying the party organization progressed quickly and had good results, and they promptly held an experience exchange meeting, organizing everyone to learn from it. Sometimes, they also adopted the method of holding exchange meetings to concentrate the scattered experiences of each unit in grasping class struggle and strengthening ideological and political work, learning from each other's strengths and compensating for each other's weaknesses. In this way, not only did each factory attach importance to the work of discovering and promoting advanced seeds, but the entire district also appeared with a good atmosphere of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, helping the lagging behind.

    上海桃浦地区在文化大革命中是怎样坚持斗争大方向的？
    排除派性干扰　狠抓思想政治工作
    本报讯　上海市桃浦地区的二十多个工厂企业的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，没有介入外地区的派别斗争，从去年三月份以来，这些厂就先后实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。革命斗争推动了生产发展，许多工厂不但完成和超额完成了生产计划，而且试制成功一些重要的新产品，进行了不少技术革新。
    增强党性，抵制派性，依靠革命群众力量坚持斗争大方向
    这个地区的无产阶级革命派，很早就把大学习、大批判放在一切工作的首要地位，炮口对准党内一小撮走资派。一年多来，他们大批资产阶级反动路线，大批修正主义工业路线，大批修正主义建党路线，一步步地把大批判深入开展下去。他们不仅联合起来召开地区性的批判斗争大会，而且还联合当地的贫下中农，一起批判斗争中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人，肃清其流毒，从而进一步加强了工农团结。他们的战斗口号是：让大学习、大批判占领一切阵地。看到了“内战”的大标语、大字报，就用大学习、大批判的标语、大字报去覆盖。共同的对敌斗争，大大促进了各厂的革命大联合和革命三结合。
    这个地区处于“内战”剧烈的普陀区。为了摆脱外来的影响，排除各种干扰，坚持革命斗争大方向，这些工厂企业的无产阶级革命派经过反复协商，特地制定了共同守则，规定各厂革命群众组织要互相学习，互相支持，反对各自拉一派打一派；发生矛盾，要通过协商讨论解决，决不搞打砸抢；不单方面同外地区挂钩，也不参加外地区的派别斗争；外地区发来的“内战”传单，不张贴，不散发，等等。根据这个原则，他们除了积极参加保卫毛主席的革命路线、保卫上海市革命委员会的革命行动外，坚决拒绝参加外地区、外单位的“内战”，因而也排除了外地区、外单位派别斗争的冲击。有一次，他们受蒙蔽，到一个地方去参加“革命行动”，赶到现场弄清事实后，就当机立断，撤回队伍。又有一次，有外单位的一些人闯入这个地区冲击一个工厂，他们立即派去代表劝说外单位撤回队伍。他们这样做，曾被人指责为“两面派”、“闭关自守”，他们都置之不理，按照无产阶级党性办事，符合毛泽东思想的坚决照办，不符合毛泽东思想的坚决抵制。
    他们还把促进各厂各组织联合对敌作为自己的责任。当有一个厂出现两派对峙的局面，有一个厂的几个组织矛盾激化，都来要求支持的时候，他们不是轻易表态，而是深入进行调查研究，摸清这些组织的情况后，就帮助这些组织一起学习毛主席的最新指示。在他们的积极、热情、耐心、细致的启发帮助下，经过斗私批修，终于使这两个厂实现了革命的大联合。
    大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓思想政治工作，正确处理人民内部矛盾
    这个地区的无产阶级革命派十分重视毛主席著作的学习和毛主席最新指示的迅速落实，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，激发群众更加热爱毛主席，更加忠于毛主席的革命路线。从去年六月份起，他们就在定期学习会的基础上，开始举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。各厂绝大多数的职工，都在毛泽东思想学习班学过，连职工集中居住的桃浦新村也办起了毛泽东思想学习班。通过在学习班上斗私批修，加上细致的思想政治工作，进一步组织教育阶级队伍，团结大多数群众和干部，集中力量打击一小撮阶级敌人。染化八厂狠抓思想政治工作，帮助不少过去站错队的同志回到毛主席的革命路线上来。有一个造反队头头，和一些同志一起，对本厂参加过保守组织赤卫队的一个青年工人，前后做了二十次思想政治工作，反复进行两条路线斗争的教育，终于使这个青年工人，主动交出了密藏半年多的赤卫队队旗，后来也参加了造反队。为了帮助曾经站错队的阶级兄弟消除对立情绪，许多厂都办过几期以这些人为主要对象的学习班。上海第二制药厂造反队头头耐心动员这些人进学习班，并向群众讲清意义，发动群众一起来做工作。有的人抱着“挨整”的情绪参加学习，不肯发言，革命派热情鼓励他们发言，并和他们一起学习毛主席著作，进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育，帮助他们找出在两条路线斗争中站错队的思想根子。大部分人通过学习，解开了思想疙瘩，政治觉悟提高很快。许多工厂企业的革命造反派头头还善于倾听不同意见，把来自革命群众的批评、建议，作为检查、督促领导工作和促进思想改造的一个重要源泉。由于思想政治工作做得比较深入细致，这里大多数工厂企业革命派和广大革命群众的关系，新老干部的关系，干部与群众的关系，都处理得比较好。党群关系也得到显著改善。
    发扬先进，开展比学赶帮活动，不停顿地把革命推向前进
    这个地区的无产阶级革命派认识到，革命的大联合和三结合要在革命斗争中不断地巩固和发展，因此，每当毛主席最新指示发出以后，每当文化大革命运动发展到新阶段的时候，他们都把发扬先进，树立典型，以点带面，作为推动本地区运动发展的一个重要方法。
    他们在工作中遇到新的问题，善于及时发现外地区先进单位的经验，还请外单位上门献宝，使先进经验在本地区生根开花。当文化大革命运动深入发展，广大革命群众迫切需要进一步掌握毛泽东思想武器的时候，他们请横沙岛贫下中农来传授活学活用毛主席著作的经验；当大学毛主席建党学说，大批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的群众运动开始的时候，他们又请先走一步的上海无线电七厂的同志来介绍经验；当社会上刮起打砸抢的乱砍机构的极“左”思潮的时候，他们请上海油墨厂的同志来介绍大批判结合本单位斗批改的体会。南京路上好八连在桃浦化工厂支左中创造了斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的好经验，他们就组织各厂造反队前往学习。
    同时他们也很注意在本地区发现在两条路线斗争中的先进苗子，及时总结，推广交流，带动一片。染化八厂的毛泽东思想学习班办得早，并有一套（带问题进班学习，亮思想斗私批修，抓一点总结经验，回部门带动一片）活学活用、学用结合的好办法，他们就推动这个厂进行总结，介绍推广，使各厂都办起了毛泽东思想学习班。上海第六制药厂整顿党组织的工作进度快，效果好，他们就及时开经验交流会，组织大家学习。有时，他们还采取召开交流会的方法，把各单位狠抓阶级斗争，加强思想政治工作等点滴经验集中起来，互相取长补短。这样，不仅使各厂重视了发现和推广先进苗子的工作，而且使全地区出现了比先进，学先进，赶先进，帮后进的好风气。
