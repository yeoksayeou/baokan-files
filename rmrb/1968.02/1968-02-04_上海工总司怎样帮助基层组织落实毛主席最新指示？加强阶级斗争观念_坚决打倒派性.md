Who loves factionalism the most? Facts have proven: the class enemies love the factionalism within our ranks, the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They use every means to instill factionalism into revolutionary mass organizations, create divisions, and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. If we are not vigilant and engage in factionalism, we will be used by the enemy, and the servants of the people may become the servants of the enemy. How dangerous that is!

	The Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters, a unified revolutionary organization of two million workers, has been actively strengthening the consciousness of class struggle from the leadership to the grassroots units. It has been strengthening proletarian party spirit, overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and clearing obstacles to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This has effectively promoted, consolidated, and developed the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination across all industrial systems in the city.

	Leaders engage in active ideological struggle, strengthen party spirit, and overcome factionalism

	The Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters believes that to help various grassroots revolutionary organizations overcome factionalism, the leadership must first strengthen party spirit and overcome factionalism. At the same time, they must help various grassroots revolutionary organizations analyze the situation of class struggle and recognize the reactionary nature of factionalism, in order to widely and deeply implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Since the "January Revolution" last year, the situation of revolutionary great alliance in Shanghai has been good, and more than 95% of the grassroots organizations have achieved revolutionary great alliance. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders and ghosts and snakes in society are unwilling to accept their defeat. They use the factionalism of some revolutionary mass organizations as their main means of struggle against the proletariat. They instill factionalism into various mass organizations, create divisions, incite the masses to fight each other, and engage in large-scale armed struggles. They aim to make the revolutionary rebels suffer mutual damage, so that they can fish in troubled waters and achieve counter-revolutionary goals. They also direct their arrows at the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters, using slander, defamation, and division as despicable means to stir up trouble among the leaders of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters. They attempt to destroy this revolutionary united fighting organization of the Shanghai proletariat.

	The factionalism within certain individuals in various grassroots revolutionary mass organizations also influences the internal leadership of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters through various channels. The leaders of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters come from the grassroots and have deep class feelings with the revolutionary mass organizations in the grassroots units. Some comrades are influenced by the factionalism in the grassroots units to varying degrees.

	In response to the above situation, the leaders of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters believe that if factionalism exists within the leadership and is not eliminated, its harm will be greater than in the grassroots units. Because factionalism often leads to one-sided support for one side within their own system; disrespect, distrust, and even attacks on other revolutionary organizations. This adds fuel to the factional struggle in the grassroots organizations, giving the class enemy more opportunities.

	To make the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters truly a strong and ideologically united revolutionary organization, the leadership core of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has been vigorously promoting class struggle, raising the class alertness of all members, continuously purging their own ranks, and preventing class enemies from infiltrating the revolutionary organization. At the same time, together with all members, they carry problems to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold experience-sharing sessions, frequently engage in criticism and self-criticism, and concentrate their efforts on combating small-groupism, regionalism, and sectarianism. They use the power of class struggle to analyze factionalism, linking it to the current sharp and complex class struggle situation, thereby seeing through the reactionary nature of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Their ideological awareness has greatly improved. Some comrades say: Who loves factionalism? The enemy loves the factionalism within our ranks. If we are not vigilant and engage in factionalism, the enemy will use it, and the servants of the people may become the servants of the enemy. Some comrades also say: "The attitude towards bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is an important indicator of whether one is a genuine revolutionary rebel in the current new situation." The leaders of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people. For Communist Party members, it means standing on the side of the Party, standing on the side of party spirit and party policy," handle all issues from the standpoint of proletarian party spirit and party policy, rather than from the standpoint of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. In the current struggle against factionalism, the leaders of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters always propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strictly require themselves and the grassroots organizations in their system to engage in more self-criticism. Because all members think and act in unison, the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters has played a powerful role in promoting and consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination across the city.

	Helping grassroots revolutionary organizations analyze the reactionary nature of factionalism from the perspective of class struggle

	To help grassroots units overcome factionalism, the leaders of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters spend most of their time on the front lines. Where factionalism is most rampant, they go there. Their primary task in grassroots units is to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the same time, they conduct thorough investigations and do not easily take a stance; based on thorough investigations, they patiently and carefully do ideological work with two opposing revolutionary organizations, and participate in their study classes and coordination meetings. The leaders of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters, on the one hand, learn from the comrades in the grassroots units and act as students; on the other hand, they enthusiastically do work, promoting both sides to unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

	In doing these works, they always start from the perspective of class struggle, helping grassroots revolutionary organizations analyze the situation, analyze problems, raise revolutionary alertness, and cut off the black hands that use factionalism. Some time ago, the struggle between the two factions in Zhabei District was intense, and the person who acted as a mediator between the two factions was a bad element. This person, under the guise of "mediation," actually stirred up the relationship between the two factions, first supporting one faction and then the other. Because of being blinded by factionalism, both factions once regarded him as a good person. After the comrades from the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters went down, they helped the two factions analyze the situation from a class perspective in the study class and exposed this bad element. Both sides overcame factionalism and quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance.

	The two revolutionary organizations in Shanghai No. 14 Cotton Mill have been engaged in "internal wars" for a long time. After the comrades from the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters went down, they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary great alliance with them. Through serious discussions, both factions realized that their directions of struggle are completely consistent, with no fundamental conflicts of interest or fundamental differences in principles. The reason why the "internal wars" have been going on for a long time is because factionalism is at work, and the class enemy has taken advantage of it. They found that the person who was secretly supporting one faction and inciting armed struggles in this factory was none other than the capitalist-roader in this factory. After exposing this matter, both factions raised their ideological awareness and quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance.

	Promoting Mao Zedong's advocated revolutionary learning style to fundamentally overcome factionalism

	Through study classes, focusing on Mao Zedong Thought education is a fundamental way to overcome factionalism. As long as Mao Zedong's advocated revolutionary learning style is truly established, Chairman Mao's latest instructions can be truly implemented from the depths of the mind. In January of this year, the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters held a study class attended by leaders of revolutionary mass organizations from various industrial systems, focusing on the issue of learning style to help the participants overcome factionalism. The leaders of the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters first helped everyone connect the study of Chairman Mao's works with the consolidation of proletarian dictatorship, making everyone realize that only by seriously studying Chairman Mao's works can the power of the proletariat be well held and used; only by deeply rooting the great Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind can the reactionary nature of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism be truly recognized and factionalism be thoroughly overcome.

	The comrades from the Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters also guided everyone to review the experiences and lessons of last year. Some comrades who engaged in factionalism conducted self-examinations of their wrong thoughts. They said: Last year, because we did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and did not follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, factionalism once flared up, and "internal wars" lasted for a long time, resulting in harm to class brothers and loss of state property. Through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they conducted serious self-criticism, realizing that regardless of large factions or small factions, old factions or new factions, whoever holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and follows Chairman Mao's strategic deployment closely is a proletarian revolutionary. After raising their ideological level, everyone unanimously felt the importance of the issue of learning style. The reason for the mistakes made last year was that the learning style was not correct, and Chairman Mao's words could not be heard. They expressed that in the future, they must correct the learning style and resolutely and quickly overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in thought and action.

    上海工总司怎样帮助基层组织落实毛主席最新指示？
    加强阶级斗争观念  坚决打倒派性
    什么人最爱派性？事实证明：阶级敌人最爱我们队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。他们千方百计地向革命群众组织灌输派性，制造分裂，破坏文化大革命。如果我们不警惕，闹派性，就要为敌人所利用，人民的勤务员就有可能变成敌人的勤务员，这是何等危险啊！
    本报讯　上海二百万工人的统一革命组织——工人革命造反总司令部，从领导机关到基层单位，积极增强阶级斗争观念，加强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，为全面落实毛主席的最新指示扫清障碍，有力地促进、巩固和发展了全市各工业系统的革命大联合和革命三结合。
      领导成员之间开展积极的思想斗争，增强党性，克服派性
    上海工总司认为，要帮助各基层革命组织打倒派性，首先要求领导机关增强党性，克服派性，同时帮助各基层革命组织分析阶级斗争的形势，认清派性的反动本质，才能把毛主席的最新指示广泛而深入地落实下去。
    从去年“一月革命”以来，上海革命大联合的形势一直很好，全市工人群众没有分裂成两大派组织，百分之九十五以上的基层组织也陆续实现了革命大联合。但是，一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神不甘心自己的失败，利用革命群众组织中某些人的派性，作为向无产阶级斗争的主要手段。他们在各群众组织中大力灌输派性，制造分裂，挑动群众斗群众，搞大规模的武斗，妄图使革命造反派两败俱伤，以便从中渔利，达到反革命目的。他们更把矛头对准工总司，采用造谣、污蔑、诽谤和分化等卑鄙手段，千方百计地挑拨工总司领导成员的关系，企图摧毁上海工人阶级这个革命的统一战斗组织。
    各个基层革命群众组织中的某些人的派性，也从各种渠道影响到工总司领导内部中来。工总司的领导成员来自基层，同基层单位的革命群众组织有着深厚的阶级感情，某些同志在不同程度上受到了基层单位派性的影响。
    针对上述情况，工总司领导成员认为，工总司是上海工人统一的革命组织，如果领导成员中存在派性，不加肃清，其危害性比基层单位更大。因为派性作怪，往往会片面地支持自己系统的一方；对其他革命组织不尊重，不信任，甚至给予打击。这样，就给基层组织的派性斗争火上加油，使阶级敌人更有可乘之机。
    为了使工总司真正成为坚强的思想统一的革命组织，工总司的领导核心，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，提高全体成员的阶级警惕性，不断清理自己的队伍，严防阶级敌人混入革命组织内部。同时和全体成员一起，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，举办讲用会交流斗私的经验，经常开展批评和自我批评，狠斗小团体主义、山头主义、宗派主义的思想，集中力量打击资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。通过学习，大家用阶级斗争的观点分析派性，把派性问题同当前尖锐复杂的阶级斗争形势联系起来，从而看透了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的反动性，思想觉悟大大提高。有的同志说：谁爱派性？敌人最爱我们队伍中的派性。如果我们不警惕，闹派性，敌人就要利用，人民的勤务员就有可能变为敌人的勤务员。有的同志还说：“对待资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，采取什么态度，是在当前新形势下衡量自己是不是真正的革命造反派的重要标志。”工总司领导成员，按照毛主席关于“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场”的教导，在处理任何问题的时候，都能站在无产阶级党性和党的政策的立场上，而不是站在资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的立场上。在当前围剿派性的斗争中，工总司领导成员时时刻刻宣传毛主席最新指示，严格要求自己和本系统的基层组织，多做自我批评。由于全体成员思想一致、行动一致，工总司在促进和巩固全市革命大联合和革命三结合的战斗中，发挥了强大作用。
      帮助基层革命组织用阶级斗争观点分析派性的反动性
    工总司的领导成员为了帮助基层单位打倒派性，大部分时间深入第一线，那个地方派性闹得最凶，就到那些地方去。他们到基层的首要任务，就是宣传毛主席的最新指示。同时，他们认真地进行调查研究，不轻易表态；在充分调查研究的基础上，对两个对立的革命组织进行耐心的细致的思想工作，并且参加他们的学习班和协商会。工总司领导成员一方面向基层的同志学习，当小学生；另一方面，满腔热情地做工作，促使双方在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来。
    在进行这些工作的时候，他们自始至终从阶级斗争观点出发，帮助基层革命组织分析形势，分析问题，提高革命警惕性，斩断利用派性的黑手。前些时候，闸北区两派斗争激烈，而充当两派调解人的却是一个坏分子，这个人名为“调解”，实际上是挑拨两派关系，先支持这一派，以后又支持那一派。由于被派性蒙住了眼睛，两派一度都把他当作好人。工总司同志下去后，在学习班上帮助两派用阶级观点分析形势，把这个坏蛋揪了出来。双方克服了派性，很快地实现了革命大联合。
    上海国棉十四厂的两个革命组织，长期以来“内战”不断。工总司同志下去后，就同他们一起学习毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示。通过认真的讨论，两派同志认识到彼此的斗争大方向完全一致，没有什么根本的利害冲突，也没有什么根本的原则分歧。两派之所以“内战”连绵不断，是由于派性作怪，而阶级敌人又乘机利用了派性。他们发现在背后打一派，拉一派，煽动这个厂武斗的不是别人，就是这个厂的走资派。把这件事揭露后，两派工人思想觉悟提高，很快地实现了革命大联合。
      大树毛主席倡导的革命学风，从根本上克服派性
    通过学习班，大抓毛泽东思想教育，这是克服派性的一条根本途径。只要真正树立起毛主席倡导的革命学风，就能从思想深处真正落实毛主席的最新指示。工总司在今年一月份，举办了有各工业系统革命群众组织头头参加的学习班，抓住学风问题，帮助学习班成员克服派性。工总司领导成员，首先帮助大家把学习毛主席著作同巩固无产阶级专政联系起来，使大家认识到，只有认真学习毛主席著作，才能把无产阶级的权掌好、用好；只有使伟大的毛泽东思想在头脑里深深扎根，才能真正认清资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的反动性，彻底地克服派性。
    工总司同志还引导大家回顾去年一年的经验教训。一些闹派性的同志纷纷检查自己的错误思想。他们说：去年由于没有按照毛主席的指示办事，没有紧跟毛主席的战略部署，一度派性发作，长期打“内战”，结果伤害了阶级兄弟，损失了国家财产。通过学习毛主席的最新指示，他们进行了认真的自我批评，认识到不管大派小派，老派新派，谁把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高，对毛主席的战略部署跟得紧，谁就是无产阶级革命派。在思想水平提高后，大家一致感到学风问题的重要性，去年所以犯了错误，就是因为学风不正，对毛主席的话听不进去。他们表示，今后一定要端正学风，坚决地、迅速地克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，把毛主席的最新指示迅速落实到思想和行动中去。
