The transport lines in North Vietnam are bustling with activity. The broad masses of workers have completed and overfulfilled their transport plans, providing powerful support for the front lines and production.

HANOI, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) — According to reports from Hanoi newspapers, the heroic fighters on the iron transport lines in North Vietnam, in the midst of the anti-American, national salvation competition, have overcome all difficulties, completed and overfulfilled their transport plans, and are fully supporting the front lines and production.

The transportation workers in Haiphong City have put forward the battle slogan of "holding the fort under any circumstances" and are actively improving transportation efficiency, making great contributions to the battle and production. The workers of the Haiphong Automobile Transportation Company have continuously overfulfilled their tasks. The transportation efficiency of various units has increased by 8 to 15 percent, and some units have doubled their efficiency. To overfulfill the tasks, the drivers start work 20 minutes earlier each day to prepare the vehicles and also participate in loading and unloading work, thus making each shift run 2 to 4 more trips than before. They also spare no effort to increase the number of trailers and transport more goods. In areas frequently bombed by enemy planes, they find new routes to ensure that goods arrive at their destinations on time and safely.

The workers of Haiphong Port have overcome the harassment of enemy planes and actively completed their transport plans. The young workers at the port have bravely taken on heavy burdens, fearlessly sacrificed themselves, and courageously and intelligently transported goods. Three-fifths of the young drivers have been awarded the glorious title of "Transport Heroes." The workers of the Haiphong Inland Waterway Transportation Company have actively found ways to increase the transportation of goods and shorten the sailing time, increasing the transportation volume by half compared to the original plan.

The workers on the transportation lines in Thanh Hoa Province, with deep hatred for American imperialism, have displayed the heroic spirit of defeating the American bandits and actively launched competitions to repair roads and build bridges. The ferry workers have also found ways to improve work efficiency, greatly shortening the ferry time. The workers of the transportation department in Son La Province have been fighting day and night on the transportation lines, not only timely repairing the roads and bridges damaged by enemy planes or floods but also building many new roads, expanding the province's transportation network.

The broad masses of workers in the railway department, under the heavy bombing by enemy planes, have highly carried forward revolutionary heroism, ensuring that the iron transport lines are indestructible and unbreakable. The workers of the N Locomotive Section, under the frequent bombing by American planes, have spared no effort to transport goods to their destinations, completing the transport plan. The workers of the A Locomotive Section have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, repairing four carriages by themselves, ensuring 28 days of operation per month, and successfully overfulfilling the state plan.

Recently, the various transport teams of the heroic Vietnam People's Army have also launched competitions. They regard improving the political awareness of the combatants as the driving force to overcome all difficulties. The soldiers have carried forward the spirit of decisive battle and victory, overcoming the bombing of enemy planes, and actively improving loading and unloading methods, increasing loading and unloading efficiency, and increasing the transportation of goods, sending more goods to the front lines. The combat units protecting the transport lines of the People's Army not only bravely fight against American bandit planes to protect the safety of the transport teams but also actively participate in repairing bridges and roads, making significant contributions to the transport teams' fast, good, and safe transportation of materials.

    铁道部门的广大职工在敌机狂轰滥炸的情况下，高度发扬革命英雄主义，保证钢铁运输线打不烂、炸不断。N机车段工人在经常受到美机轰炸的情况下，千方百计把货物运到目的地，完成了运输计划。A机务段的工人发扬自力更生精神，自己维修了四个车厢，保证每月行车二十八天，胜利地超额完成国家计划。
