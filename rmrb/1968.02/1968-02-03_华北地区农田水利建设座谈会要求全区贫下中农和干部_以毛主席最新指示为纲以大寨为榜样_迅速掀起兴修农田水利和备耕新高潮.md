The meeting on agricultural water conservancy construction in North China, recently held in Beijing, proposed that all poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the region should take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, with an unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively. They should learn from Dazhai, quickly launch a new high tide of agricultural water conservancy construction and spring ploughing preparation, seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and achieve an all-around bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

The comrades who participated in this meeting repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related instructions on agricultural water conservancy construction, as well as the New Year's editorial. They presented a large amount of facts to illustrate that the situation in rural North China, like other parts of the country, is excellent. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, and agricultural production last year saw an all-around bumper harvest. Since winter, agricultural water conservancy construction has been vigorously carried out, and the revolution and production in rural areas are both thriving.

The meeting believed that in this excellent situation, we must continue to strive forward, follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the all-around bumper harvest in agriculture.

The meeting required all cadres at various levels who are responsible for agricultural production to firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Grasping revolution means grasping class struggle, grasping the work of transforming people's souls, and grasping political work. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." This requires the utmost effort to intensify the education of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply in rural areas, to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. Only in this way can we do a good job in agricultural production. Therefore, at present, the greatest political task and the most important thing is to, with an unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, quickly and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and truly make Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions guide all our actions and work. This requires us to take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline and continue to run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes well. The meeting also believed that it is necessary to closely combine with local actual conditions, further deepen the criticism of the revisionist fallacies such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "four freedoms," and "self-reliance, self-management, and self-financing" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various parts of North China, and eliminate their poisonous influence.

The comrades who participated in the meeting unanimously agreed, while studying, visiting, and exchanging experiences, that to quickly and comprehensively develop agricultural production, we must learn from the people of Dazhai, follow the Dazhai path, build Dazhai-style fields, and seriously carry out the mass movement of learning from Dazhai. Learning from Dazhai means learning from the essence, that is, learning from the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai who are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, learning and using it, combining learning with practice, and seeing immediate results; learning from the spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the people of Dazhai, insisting on long-term agricultural basic construction; learning from the communist ideology of the people of Dazhai who work for the revolution. The meeting required all places to, at present, take Dazhai as an example and quickly launch a practical new high tide of agricultural water conservancy construction and spring ploughing preparation to actively create material conditions for achieving an all-around bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

The comrades who participated in the meeting pointed out that there are only two or three months left before the busy spring ploughing season. All cadres at various levels should, with a high sense of responsibility for the socialist revolution and socialist construction, prioritize revolutionary interests, bravely stand out, bravely take on heavy responsibilities; go to the production front line, put down their airs, get close to the masses, humbly learn from the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit, to do a better job in agricultural water conservancy construction and spring ploughing preparation.

    华北地区农田水利建设座谈会要求全区贫下中农和干部
    以毛主席最新指示为纲以大寨为榜样
    迅速掀起兴修农田水利和备耕新高潮
    据新华社二日讯　最近在北京召开的华北地区农田水利建设座谈会，提出全区广大贫下中农和革命干部要以毛主席的最新指示为纲，以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，逐条地、全面地落实毛主席的最新指示，以大寨为榜样，迅速掀起一个兴修农田水利和备耕的新高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，夺取今年农业全面大丰收。
    参加这次会议的同志反复学习了毛主席的最新指示和有关农田水利工作指示，学习了元旦社论。他们摆出大量事实，说明华北地区农村和全国各地一样，形势一片大好。无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利，农业生产去年获得全面大丰收，入冬以来，农田水利建设蓬蓬勃勃地展开，广大农村革命和生产都呈现一片热气腾腾、欣欣向荣的景象。
    会议认为，在一片大好形势下，必须再接再厉，沿着毛主席指引的道路，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利和农业生产的全面丰收。
    会议要求领导农业生产的各级干部，应该坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针。抓革命，就是抓阶级斗争，抓改造灵魂的工作，抓政治工作。
  “政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”这就要用最大的精力，大抓狠抓对群众进行毛泽东思想的教育，在广大农村更加广泛和深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，用毛泽东思想武装群众，只有促使人的思想革命化，才能抓好农业生产工作。因此，在当前，最大的政治，最重要的大事，就是要以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，迅速地、全面地落实毛主席的最新指示，真正作到用毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示统帅我们的一切行动和工作。这就要以“斗私，批修”为纲，继续办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。会议还认为，必须密切结合当地的实际情况，进一步深入地批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在华北各地的代理人所推行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“四大自由”、“三自一包”等反革命修正主义谬论，肃清其流毒。
    参加会议的同志在学习、参观、交流经验时，
  一致认为，迅速地全面地发展农业生产，必须学大寨人，走大寨路，建大寨田，认真开展学大寨的群众运动。学大寨，就要学到根本处，就是学大寨人无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的革命精神，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，学了就用，学用结合，立竿见影的革命学风，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；学大寨人自力更生、艰苦创业的精神，坚持长年搞农田基本建设；学大寨人一心为公，为革命种田的共产主义思想。会议要求各地，在当前，都应以大寨为榜样，迅速掀起一个扎扎实实兴修农田水利和备耕的新高潮，为夺取今年农业全面大丰收积极创造物质条件。
    参加会议的同志指出，现在离春耕大忙时节只有两、三个月了。各级干部都应以对社会主义革命和社会主义建设高度负责的精神，以革命利益为重，勇敢地站出来，勇敢地挑重担；走向生产第一线，放下架子，深入群众，虚心向群众学习，重视群众的首创精神，把农田水利工作、备耕工作做得更好。
