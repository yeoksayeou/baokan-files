Not long ago, American imperialism was vigorously spreading optimistic air about the Vietnam War. Johnson, in his State of the Union address, boasted that in the past year, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army had been "defeated in one battle after another." He repeatedly shouted that the U.S. invasion forces in South Vietnam were "making progress." The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, pounded his chest and guaranteed: "This progress is steady and real." He even had the audacity to claim: "We have reached an important moment; now the end is in sight." U.S. officials also said that "now two-thirds of the South Vietnamese people live in safe areas under the control of the South Vietnamese government (referring to the puppet regime)."

However, in the blink of an eye, all the boasts made by the Johnson administration were shattered by the New Year's victories of the South Vietnamese military and people. The South Vietnamese military and people launched a comprehensive and fierce attack on the U.S.-puppet clique, defeating the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs in a rout. In just a few days, they annihilated more than 50,000 enemy troops, truly "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat." Westmoreland was forced to admit in despair that the fierce offensive of the South Vietnamese military and people had caused "great terror" among the U.S.-puppet forces. The myths of "progress" and "safety" propagated by Johnson and his ilk all burst like soap bubbles. The "end" is indeed "in sight," but it is the end of the complete failure of U.S. imperialism. The crushing defeat of U.S. imperialism has caused a wave of panic and lamentation within the American ruling class. The Washington *Evening Star* complained that the United States had "made a tragically low estimate of the enemy's strength and capabilities." Senator Mansfield shouted: "We must reassess the entire picture."

So, will U.S. imperialism now correctly estimate the strength of the Vietnamese people? No, this is impossible. Its reactionary class nature determines that even when it suffers defeat, it cannot correctly estimate the strength of the people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out during the Third Chinese Civil War: "The enemy always underestimates the initiative of our army, and always overestimates their own strength, although they are also like a frightened bird at the same time." U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam War is exactly the same. Under the heavy blows of the Vietnamese people, it has long become a frightened bird, but it still underestimates the strength of the Vietnamese people and overestimates its own strength. Therefore, it always estimates once, fails once, "reevaluates" once, and fails again... Thus, it step by step walks towards complete failure.

In recent years, U.S. imperialism has been acting according to this logic. U.S. military leaders Steele and Taylor once predicted that victory in eliminating the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people could be achieved by 1962. 1962 passed, and the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Harkins, declared that 1963 was a "critical year." 1963 passed, and U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara claimed that by 1965, U.S. imperialism could "pacify" the entire South Vietnam. But by 1965, this "rapid pacification" advocate had to "reevaluate" again...

The repeated "reevaluations" of the U.S. ruling class only show that after failing in its troublemaking, U.S. imperialism still wants to cause more trouble. For this reason, the gentlemen in Washington need to constantly use so-called "reevaluations" to deceive others, while also deceiving themselves.

    自欺欺人的“重新估计”
    郭辛兵
    不久以前，美帝国主义还在起劲儿地为侵越战争散布乐观空气。约翰逊在国情咨文中，胡吹什么过去一年越南南方解放军“在一个又一个战役中被击败”。他一再叫嚷美国侵略军在南越“正在取得进展”。侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰拍着胸脯担保：“这个进展是稳步的、真实的”。他甚至大言不惭宣称：“我们已到达一个重要时刻，现在尽头已开始在望。”美国官员也说什么“现在有三分之二的南越人民生活在南越政府（指伪政权）控制的安全地区”。
    可是，曾几何时，约翰逊政府所吹的种种牛皮，一下子就被越南南方军民的新春大捷所粉碎。越南南方军民对美伪集团发动的全面的猛烈的袭击，把美帝国主义及其走狗打得落花流水，几天之内歼敌五万多名，真是“横扫千军如卷席”。威斯特摩兰也不得不沮丧地供认，越南南方军民的凌厉攻势，造成美伪军“极大的恐怖”。约翰逊之流的什么“进展”、“安全”等等神话，都象肥皂泡一样统统破灭了。“尽头”的确“已开始在望”，不过这是美帝国主义彻底失败的尽头罢了。美帝国主义的惨败，在美国统治集团内部引起了一片惊恐和悲叹。华盛顿《明星晚报》抱怨说，美国对“敌人的力量和能力可悲地作出过低的估计”。参议员曼斯菲尔德叫喊：“我们必须重新估计整个图景”。
    这样说来，美帝国主义是不是从此就会正确地估计越南人民的力量了呢？不，这是不可能的。它的反动阶级本性决定了：即使在它遭到失败的时候，也不可能正确地估计人民的力量。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在中国第三次国内革命战争时期曾经指出：“敌人对于我军的积极性总是估计不足的，对于自己力量总是估计过高，虽然他们同时又是惊弓之鸟。”美帝国主义在侵越战争中也正是如此。在越南人民的沉重打击下，它早已成了一只惊弓之鸟，但是，它仍然低估越南人民的力量，高估自己的力量。因而它总是估计一次，破产一次，“重新估计”一次，重新破产一次……就这样一步步地走向彻底的失败。
    几年来，美帝国主义就是按照这个逻辑行事的。美国的军事头目斯特利和泰勒曾经预言，在一九六二年就可以取得消灭越南南方人民武装的“胜利”。一九六二年过去了，美国驻南越的“大使”哈金斯又断言，一九六三年是“关键性的一年”。一九六三年过去了，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉宣称，到一九六五年美帝国主义就可以“平定”整个南越。而到了一九六五年，这个“迅速平定论”者又不得不“重新估计”……。
    美国统治集团一次又一次的“重新估计”，不过表明美帝国主义在捣乱失败之后，仍然要捣乱而已。正因为这样，华盛顿的老爷们才需要不断用所谓“重新估计”来欺骗别人，同时也欺骗自己。
