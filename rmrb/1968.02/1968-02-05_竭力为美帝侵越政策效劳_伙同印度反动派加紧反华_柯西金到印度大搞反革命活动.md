According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on February 1, our correspondent reports: Just as U.S. imperialism is being beaten to a pulp by the heroic Vietnamese people, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin personally led a group to India, conspiring with Indian reactionaries and the Yugoslav renegade clique leader Tito, strenuously serving the U.S. imperialist's plot for a "peace talk" in Vietnam, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. At the same time, Kosygin is also sparing no effort to plot anti-China schemes, driving the Indian reactionaries to further intensify their anti-China activities, acting as the vanguard for U.S.-Soviet anti-China forces.

Throughout the visit, Kosygin did not mention a word about U.S. imperialism's mad aggression in Asia, nor did he mention the Vietnamese people's earth-shaking struggle against the common enemy of the world's people, U.S. imperialism.

Kosygin, Tito, and Indira Gandhi were conspiring in New Delhi on how to help U.S. imperialism extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. In the joint statement issued by Tito and Indira Gandhi on January 27 and the joint statement issued by Kosygin and Indira Gandhi on January 31, almost identical phrases were used, saying that stopping the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would create conditions for negotiations aimed at a political settlement. According to an announcement by an Indian government spokesman on January 27, Kosygin reiterated to Indira Gandhi the Soviet government's position that "the U.S. stopping the bombing of North Vietnam would lead to peace talks." These accomplices and lackeys of U.S. imperialism are thus wholeheartedly serving the U.S. imperialist's "bombing to lure talks" plot, attempting to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms before achieving final victory.

Another important purpose of Kosygin's visit is to study how to provide more military and economic "aid" to the Indian reactionary government, using it to further oppose China.

Since Kosygin came to power, the Soviet revisionists have provided more military "aid" to the Indian reactionaries than during the Khrushchev era. Recently, three MiG aircraft factories built by the Soviet revisionists with Indian help have gone into production, and the Soviet revisionists have handed over modern weapons such as submarines and missiles to the Indian reactionaries. On the day Kosygin arrived in India, the *Indian Times* revealed that the Indian government had received 100 Soviet-made Su-7 supersonic fighter-bombers, which are to be used against China. The Indian government has already notified the U.S. of this deal. During this visit to India, Kosygin also discussed with Indira Gandhi and the Indian Defense Minister the Indian government's additional military needs.

To help the Indian reactionaries strengthen their forces against China, the Soviet revisionist clique continues to provide economic support to the Indian reactionaries and exploit the Indian people through these "aid" programs. Since Kosygin came to power, the loans provided to India have reached 7.5 billion rupees, while before Kosygin came to power, it was over 3.8 billion rupees. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and India in 1968 is double that of 1964.

It is reported that during this visit, Kosygin discussed with the Indian Deputy Prime Minister, the infamous pro-American politician Desai, the issue of the Soviet revisionists' so-called "public" economy (bureaucratic capital) expanding investments in India.

It is revealed that Kosygin and Indira Gandhi discussed the issue of jointly opposing China multiple times. They are terrified of the glorious victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are desperately slandering China. On the day Kosygin left India, January 31, he specially held a secret talk with the notorious traitor Deng, who once sold out to British imperialism, on issues such as opposing China.

### 竭力为美帝侵越政策效劳　伙同印度反动派加紧反华  柯西金到印度大搞反革命活动

    竭力为美帝侵越政策效劳　伙同印度反动派加紧反华
    柯西金到印度大搞反革命活动
    据新华社一日讯　本社记者报道：正当美帝国主义被英勇的越南人民打得落花流水的时候，苏修头目柯西金亲自率领一帮人马跑到印度，同印度反动派和正在印度活动的南斯拉夫叛徒集团头子铁托密谋，竭力为美帝策划的越南“和谈”阴谋效劳，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国正义斗争的烈火。与此同时，柯西金还不遗余力地策划反华阴谋，驱使印度反动派进一步加紧反华勾当，充当美苏反华的马前卒。
    在整个访问期间，柯西金只字不提美帝国主义正在亚洲疯狂进行侵略，只字不提越南人民正在进行反对世界人民公敌美帝国主义的惊天动地的斗争。
    柯西金同英迪拉·甘地和铁托，在新德里密谋的正是如何帮助美帝国主义去扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火。在一月二十七日发表的铁托—英迪拉·甘地联合公报和一月三十一日发表的柯西金—英迪拉·甘地的联合公报中，都使用了几乎一模一样的词句，说什么停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸，将为实现政治解决而举行的谈判创造条件。据印度政府发言人一月二十七日宣布，柯西金向英迪拉·甘地重申了苏联政府的立场，即：“美国停止轰炸北越会导致和谈”。美帝国主义的这些帮凶和走卒们，就是这样一心一意地为实现美帝的“停炸诱和”阴谋效劳，妄图使越南人民在取得最后胜利以前就放下武器。
    柯西金此行的另一个重要目的，是研究如何向印度反动政府提供更多的军事和经济“援助”，利用它进一步反对中国。
    自从柯西金上台以来，苏修给予印度反动派的军事“援助”，远远超过赫鲁晓夫当政的时期。最近，苏修帮助印度修建的三座米格飞机工厂已经投入生产，苏修还把潜水艇、导弹等现代化武器交给印度反动派。就在柯西金到达印度的当天，《印度时报》透露，印度政府已经收到一百架苏制苏—7型超音速战斗轰炸机，这些军用飞机是用来对付中国的，印度政府已经把这桩交易通知了美国。柯西金在这次访印期间，又同英迪拉·甘地和印度国防部长商谈了印度政府在军事方面的额外需要。
    为了帮助印度反动派加强反对中国的力量，苏修集团继续在经济上为印度反动派输血，并且通过这些经济“援助”压榨印度人民。柯西金上台以来向印度提供的贷款达七十五亿卢比，而在柯西金上台之前是三十八亿多卢比。苏印一九六八年的贸易额比一九六四年增加一倍。
    据报道，柯西金在这次访问期间，同印度副总理、臭名远扬的亲美政客德赛商谈了苏修向印度的所谓“公营”经济（官僚资本）扩大投资的问题。
    据透露，柯西金同英迪拉·甘地多次谈到共同反华的问题。他们对中国的无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利怕得要死，拚命诽谤中国。柯西金在离开印度的当天一月三十一日，还特地同曾经卖身投靠英帝国主义的大叛徒丹吉，就反华等问题举行了密谈。
