Mao Zedong Thought study classes are the solution to problems!
—Investigation Report on the Situation of Qingdao Vehicle Factory Holding Twelve Consecutive Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The situation of Qingdao Vehicle Factory holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes fully proves that Mao Zedong Thought study classes are the best classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. They are good venues for using the arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot down the erroneous thoughts in people's minds. In the study classes, people sit down, expose their thoughts, fight against selfishness, and from beginning to end, use Chairman Mao's teachings to examine their thoughts and actions. Using self-criticism as a weapon, they spark a revolution in the depths of their souls. The result is a spirit of vigor, clear minds, and putting Chairman Mao's latest instructions into practice in their thoughts and actions. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory unanimously praise: Mao Zedong Thought study classes are good! They solve problems!

Significant Achievements from Long-Term Persistent Study Classes

The Revolutionary Committee of Qingdao Vehicle Factory, with the help of the stationed PLA comrades, started holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes from mid-July last year to the present. The factory has over 1,100 workers, and more than 1,000 have participated in the study classes, with about 100 participating in two or three sessions.

Through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the factory has achieved the following significant results:

The great alliance of revolution has been consolidated and developed. Over 98% of the revolutionary workers in the entire factory have joined the unified revolutionary mass organization—the Alliance of Revolutionary Rebels. The petty-bourgeois ideology within the revolutionary ranks has been gradually guided onto the track of proletarian revolution.

Revolutionary committees from the factory level to the workshop level have been gradually established. Over 85% of the middle and high-level cadres have stood up, and many have participated in the three-in-one leadership teams of the factory or workshops. The thought revolutionization of the leadership teams at all levels has been gradually strengthened, and they have great prestige among the masses.

The deceived masses have returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary factions to seize the revolution and promote production.

The revolution has promoted production. In 1967, the entire factory exceeded the national production plan every month, every quarter, and for the entire year.

The Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Must Bravely Take Power and Not Fear Difficulties

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by the vehicle factory, based on Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and combined with the actual situation of the factory, have focused on solving one problem in each session.

The factory seized power on January 23 last year. In early April, the revolutionary mass organizations, following the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill, achieved revolutionary great unity by department. The factory established the Alliance of Revolutionary Rebels, with participants accounting for over 86% of the total number of workers. The factory revolutionary committee was quickly established.

In the early days of the revolutionary faction taking power, liaison personnel were set up in workshops and small groups. At that time, the liaison personnel, due to lack of experience, had heavy work and tasks, and encountered many difficulties. Many people had fluctuations in their thoughts. They flocked to the factory revolutionary committee to complain, ask for solutions, and even some proposed: "I can participate in the revolution, but I can't take power, please replace me!"

This was a major problem that had to be solved at that time. How to solve it? The factory revolutionary committee and the stationed military comrades conducted a study and learned from Chairman Mao's teachings on "the situation is constantly changing, to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must study." They decided to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes to unify people's thoughts with the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The first session of the study class officially started on July 15. This session gathered over 60 workshop liaison personnel.

The first lesson of the study class was to talk about the greatness and correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao and the revolutionary line. The students' deep class feelings for Chairman Mao reached a new height, and they had a strong desire to study Mao Zedong Thought. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, the brilliant "Three Articles," and relevant documents of the Cultural Revolution. During this period, the members of the revolutionary committee and the PLA comrades had individual talks and home visits with the students.

Through study and discussion, everyone realized: the proletarian revolutionary faction must take power well and use power well, carry the revolution through to the end. This is the need of class struggle. Revolutionary factions must bravely shoulder responsibilities and must not fear difficulties.

In the study and discussion, they used the three brilliant images in the "Three Articles" as a mirror and the four characters "complete" and "thorough" as a yardstick to examine themselves. They dug out the "self" hidden behind fearing difficulties, complaining, and wanting to resign, and fought against this "self," determining to serve the people wholeheartedly.

During this period, the revolutionary committee recommended two model figures to the students: one was a liaison personnel from the assembly workshop, and the other was a liaison personnel from a small group. The liaison personnel from the assembly workshop often thought about the next day's work the day before, and in the morning, they would bring a relevant quotation from Chairman Mao into the workshop to organize the masses to study, mobilize and rely on the masses to complete the tasks. The liaison personnel from the small group seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, led the masses with personal examples in everything, and the entire group's revolution and production were excellent. These two liaison personnel who guided their actions with Mao Zedong Thought, eliminated selfishness and established public-mindedness, and worked tirelessly, set living examples for everyone.

In this way, the students unified their thoughts, clarified their direction, saw the examples, gained experience, and their work confidence doubled.

Bringing Out the Initiative of Grassroots Cadres to the Fullest

The revolutionary committee of the vehicle factory and the stationed military comrades tasted the sweetness of holding study classes and decided to continue holding them.

Next, they held a study class for small group liaison personnel. The method of this session was the same as the first session, and the effect was also the same.

The problem of liaison personnel was solved, and the third session was opened for workshop and small group leaders and safety and welfare personnel to participate in the study class. The factory revolutionary committee held this session with the following considerations: only the initiative of liaison personnel, without the active cooperation of small group leaders and safety and welfare personnel, the revolution and production would also be difficult to proceed smoothly. At that time, there were revolutionary factions among the small group leaders and safety and welfare personnel, and there were also masses who had been deceived for a while. Although they had begun to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they still needed education and help.

The content of this session was basically the same as the first session. Chairman Mao's great examples, Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, and the education of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines deeply touched the souls of the students. Some production group leaders, who had not been united with the liaison personnel in the past, actively made self-criticisms in the study class. Some, before the study class ended, took the time to return to the small group and checked their irresponsible thoughts towards the revolutionary cause. Mao Zedong Thought changed the spiritual face of this session's students. From then on, the unity between workshops and small groups was strengthened, and the atmosphere of fighting together for the proletarian revolutionary cause became thicker. Revolutionary big criticism and production took a big step forward.

However, this session differed from the previous ones in the method of summary. The summaries of the previous two study classes were made by a few people from the factory revolutionary committee, which were orderly but could not fully reflect the students' unlimited love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought after studying, and the changes in their spiritual face. Therefore, starting from the third session, the students themselves made the summaries, and everyone talked about their gains and experiences from the study. This summary was very vivid and moving. People rushed to speak. An old worker, with a few simple words, expressed his loyalty to Chairman Mao, the Party, and the revolutionary cause. This summary was actually another session of using Chairman Mao's works to speak and learn, exchanging and promoting each other, and raising together.

Helping Deceived Class Brothers Raise Their Consciousness

After this, a session of the study class was held for the masses who were deeply deceived and had not yet joined the alliance.

At that time, their mental state was: some people felt that they had taken the wrong side in the Cultural Revolution, had come up with "ideas" to attack the revolutionary faction, and had a sad future, just waiting for the later stage of the movement to be dealt with, so they were quite depressed; some people thought they were sincerely revolutionary, and could not bear the words "deceived," they were not convinced by the revolutionary faction, and were not active in work and production; and a few people still opposed the revolutionary great unity.

How should they be dealt with? The revolutionary committee had a two-day discussion. They analyzed that among these people, old workers were the majority, and the vast majority had good origins and were class brothers. They were deeply poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line and had not yet awakened. For them, they must not adopt a discriminatory attitude and must help them enthusiastically, and the best way was to organize them to participate in the study class.

After the revolutionary committee members unified their understanding, they issued a notice. At the beginning, they did not come. They thought this was intentionally "persecuting" them. The members of the revolutionary committee and the PLA comrades patiently had individual talks with them, clarified their attitude, explained that the root of the opposition between class brothers was China's Khrushchev, and sincerely hoped they would participate in the study. Finally, they agreed, but some still said, "If you persecute us, we will leave!"

The revolutionary committee adopted a completely trusting attitude towards the masses and fully believed that the great Mao Zedong Thought would definitely make these deceived class brothers awaken. As soon as the study class began, the students themselves formed groups, selected group leaders, and recorded themselves. If there were still doubts, they could not record. The leaders of the revolutionary committee studied with them, exposed their thoughts, fought against selfishness, and cared for them in every way.

This session focused on studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the struggle between the two lines. Everyone voluntarily examined and checked themselves, and their consciousness was greatly raised. A cadre from the factory who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line and had awakened earlier came to the study class to speak from personal experience, talking about his lessons and analyzing the essence of the struggle between the two lines. This made everyone wake up further. They all made self-criticisms, and many even cried bitterly, talking about how Chairman Mao had saved their families, while they had not stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line during the Cultural Revolution and had been opposed to class brothers for a long time, truly letting down Chairman Mao. With the rise of consciousness, they loved Chairman Mao even more and hated China's Khrushchev even more. They resolutely declared that they would completely break with the bourgeois reactionary line and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

This session had 47 participants, and when the study ended, everyone submitted an application to join the alliance. This played a considerable role in further consolidating the revolutionary great unity of the entire factory.

Guiding Petty-Bourgeois Thought onto the Proletarian Track

The problem of the deceived masses was solved, and at this time, another prominent problem was the spread of petty-bourgeois ideology among a part of the revolutionary faction.

In this factory's revolutionary faction, a small part of the people, mainly young people, had fluctuations in their emotions because they had not been able to take on the role of liaison personnel, their revolutionary enthusiasm weakened, and their labor discipline relaxed. They also regarded themselves as "old rebels" and could not bear the criticisms of their comrades.

For these young people, the factory revolutionary committee specially organized a study class. However, the students of this session were different from the previous ones. Explaining principles to them seemed to be understood; discussing problems, they could not sit still; studying the "Three Articles," many could recite them to you like water. Therefore, the study class started slowly. At this time, the revolutionary committee invited two old workers to use their own bitter family history and the contrast between before and after liberation to give the students a profound class education. Class education, once grasped, was effective. The old workers' remembrances and contrasts aroused the young people's love for the new society, hatred for the old society, and boundless love for Chairman Mao, and boundless hatred for China's Khrushchev.

At this time, they themselves formed groups, selected group leaders, and managed themselves. No one was late or left early, and the study became very serious. They also carefully understood the principles. They used Chairman Mao's teachings to examine and check themselves. Many people deeply dug out the root of their emotional fluctuations, and laid out the harm of doing revolution with a "self." Some checked themselves for having the thought of "revolutionary success" and "wandering." They deeply felt that their usual performance violated Chairman Mao's teachings and decided to eliminate the "self" and catch up with the pace of the Cultural Revolution.

Through the study, they found the root of the problem, touched their souls, and after the students graduated, they reversed their previous state and became active in all aspects.

Starting from Education to Solve the Problem of Middle and High-Level Cadres

At this time, Chairman Mao's latest instructions when inspecting North China, Central China, and East China were issued, and Comrade Lin Biao's call to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes was made. The factory revolutionary committee decided to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions step by step and work harder to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The revolutionary committee studied the situation of the factory and believed that the current task was to focus on solving the cadre problem.

The middle and high-level cadres of this factory, in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, some executed the bourgeois reactionary line. Although they later criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, most cadres had been liberated, but among them, some did not dare to take on heavy responsibilities, and even had grievances and resistance.

The revolutionary committee organized a study class for cadres to start from education and solve the cadre thought problem. The study class, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a guide, led the students to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. The students studied documents, raised their awareness, proposed problems themselves, and solved them themselves. They compared their contributions in the Cultural Revolution with the revolutionary youngsters and felt that they must learn from the revolutionary youngsters. They recalled the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation and education of them and the help of the revolutionary masses to them, and the more they recalled, the more they felt they had let down the Party and Chairman Mao, let down the revolutionary masses. They checked their attitudes towards the masses and their current revolutionary enthusiasm, and the more they checked, the more they felt they had let down Chairman Mao's teachings and deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the process of recalling and checking, many people had tears in their eyes and were very emotional. They all expressed that they would definitely reform their worldview thoroughly and definitely follow Chairman Mao to make a revolution.

After seeing their current situation, many people also checked how they started from "self" in the Cultural Revolution, feared making mistakes, and as a result, really made mistakes. Now they have recognized their mistakes and the lessons they should learn from them. In this way, they truly drew a clear line between the two lines in their thoughts.

In the past, many cadres' understanding of their own mistakes was not deep, and their grievances could not be eliminated. After this study, their thoughts were clear, their grievances were gone, and their revolutionary enthusiasm greatly increased. They all went to the front line and seized the revolution and promoted production with the masses. The masses all reflected: the cadres had changed a lot after studying in the study class!

This session of the study class not only made the already liberated cadres further improve their thoughts but also had a promoting effect on the cadres who had not yet stood up.

Building the Workshop Revolutionary Committee on a Solid Mass Foundation

The vehicle factory has a total of 34 middle and high-level cadres. Three cadres at the factory level have already stood up, two of whom have participated in the leadership team of the factory revolutionary committee. After the study class for cadres ended, the factory revolutionary committee considered the issue of the workshop-level revolutionary committee. One method to establish the workshop revolutionary committee is to appoint it from the factory revolutionary committee, and another method is to elect it through the masses. The vehicle factory adopted the latter.

To make the workshop revolutionary committee a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat, the factory revolutionary committee continued to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They organized a group of old and new cadres to participate in the study according to Chairman Mao's requirements for the five conditions of proletarian revolutionary successors, and at the same time, absorbed a part of the worker masses to participate.

This session of the study class, with "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, the students, with a high sense of responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause, exposed their selfishness, fought against it, raised their consciousness, and raised their understanding. They enthusiastically discussed the great situation, were full of boundless confidence in the brilliant revolutionary future, and repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," establishing the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly. The situation of the study class was reflected to each workshop in time, making the broad revolutionary workers of the entire factory have a deeper understanding of these students.

After the study ended, through the election of the masses, the workshop revolutionary committees were formed. Such workshop revolutionary committees, with a solid thought and mass foundation, had high prestige and effectively led the revolution and production of their respective workshops.

The Members of the Revolutionary Committee Continue to Revolutionize Themselves with the Help of the Masses

Recently, the vehicle factory revolutionary committee is holding the twelfth session of the study class. The students of this session are all the members of the factory revolutionary committee.

The vehicle factory, through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, has gradually solved many prominent problems in the factory. However, the revolutionary committee of the factory is not satisfied with these achievements. They decided, according to the spirit of the New Year's editorial, to use high standards to check the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, truly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item, comprehensively, and without any reduction, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

To listen to the masses' criticisms, this session of the study class invited an old worker from each workshop to participate.

In the study class, the students repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, talked about their understanding, talked about the actual situation of the factory, exposed their selfish thoughts, and carried out criticism and self-criticism.

After the inspection, they found some gaps between themselves and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, which could be summarized as:

Factionalism. Although the entire factory had already achieved revolutionary great unity and eliminated opposing emotions, some people still had feelings of closeness and distance between those who rebelled early and late, and between the revolutionary faction and the masses who had been deceived for a while. This phenomenon existed among some masses and also existed among a few committee members.

Correctly handling the cadre issue. A part of the revolutionary faction did not fully trust the cadres who had already stood up and did not dare to use them boldly.

The cadres' own problems. Some cadres who had participated in the three-in-one leadership still had the "self" clinging to them, did not dare to work boldly, and feared making mistakes again.

In the study class, the participating old workers sharply raised some criticisms. They criticized several standing committee members for participating in labor less recently and visiting the sick and old workers less; they hoped that the leaders of the factory revolutionary committee would often go down to walk around and have broader contact with the masses. They especially hoped that the factory revolutionary committee would regularly check the plans of each unit to study Chairman Mao's works.

For the problems checked out and the criticisms raised by the old workers, the factory revolutionary committee paid great attention and decided to thoroughly correct them. Therefore, they decided that after the study ended, all the committee members would go to the workshops, bringing the situation of this session of the study class and their own problems, exposing their selfishness and fighting against it, setting an example for the masses, and being supervised by the masses to correct themselves. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to continue to raise criticisms and raise problems, laying a new foundation for further and more solid implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Before the twelfth session of the study class, the vehicle factory also held several other sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. For example:

They held a study class for militiamen according to Chairman Mao's teachings on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people."

They held two sessions of study classes for party members, revolutionary factions, and old workers according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions on rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building, studying Chairman Mao's party-building theories, criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line, and making some preparations for rectifying the party organization and strengthening party building in this factory.

The vehicle factory's holding of Mao Zedong Thought study classes was indeed very effective, and many problems were solved in the study classes; it was indeed welcomed by the masses. Many students, when they graduated, all requested: let me come again next time! The revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of this factory unanimously decided: Mao Zedong Thought study classes must continue to be held, forever held, so that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions can be implemented and implemented again, and the great Mao Zedong Thought can take root and take root again in people's minds!

### 毛泽东思想学习班就是解决问题！——青岛车辆厂连续举办十二期毛泽东思想学习班情况的调查报告

    办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。
    毛泽东思想学习班就是解决问题！
    ——青岛车辆厂连续举办十二期毛泽东思想学习班情况的调查报告
    毛主席最近教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”青岛车辆厂举办毛泽东思想学习班的情况充分证明，毛泽东思想学习班，是活学活用毛泽东思想的最好的课堂，是用毛泽东思想之矢，射人们头脑中错误思想之的的好场所。在学习班里，人们坐下来，亮思想，斗“私”字，自始至终以毛主席的教导对照自己的思想和行为，以自我批评为武器，在灵魂深处爆发革命。其结果是精神抖擞，心明眼亮，把毛主席的最新指示落实到自己的思想和行动上。车辆厂广大革命职工一致称赞：毛泽东思想学习班就是好！就是解决问题！
    长期坚持办学习班取得的重要成果
    青岛车辆厂革命委员会，在驻厂解放军同志帮助下，从去年七月中旬开始到现在，已经先后举办了十二期毛泽东思想学习班（最初几期叫“毛主席著作学习班”）。这个厂共有职工一千一百多人，参加过学习班学习的已经超过一千人，其中约有一百人参加过两期或三期。
    这个厂通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，取得了如下重要成果：
    革命大联合巩固、发展了，全厂百分之九十八以上的革命职工，参加了统一的革命群众组织——无产阶级革命派联合会；革命队伍中的小资产阶级思想，被逐步引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。
    革命委员会由厂到车间，已经逐步建立起来；中层以上干部，解决了如何正确对待群众、正确对待自己的问题，百分之八十五以上站了出来，许多人参加了厂或车间的三结合领导班子；各级领导班子的思想革命化逐步加强，在群众中很有威信。
    受蒙蔽的群众回到了毛主席的革命路线上来，和革命派并肩战斗，抓革命促生产。
    革命促进了生产，一九六七年，全厂月月、季季、全年超额完成国家生产计划。
    无产阶级革命派要勇于掌权不怕困难
    车辆厂举办的毛泽东思想学习班，根据毛主席的伟大战略部署，结合本厂的实际，每一期着重解决一个问题。
    这个厂是去年一月二十三日夺权的。四月上旬，革命群众组织，按照贵阳棉纺厂的经验，实现了按部门的革命大联合，全厂成立了无产阶级革命派联合会。参加联合会的职工，当时占职工总人数的百分之八十六以上。厂革命委员会很快就建立起来。
    革命派掌权初期，在车间和小组设立了若干联络员。当时，联络员由于缺乏经验，工作多，任务重，曾经遇到不少困难。不少人因此产生思想波动。他们纷纷找到厂革委会，发牢骚，要办法，甚至有人提出要求说：“让我干革命可以，掌权不行，另外换人吧！”
    这是当时面临的一个必须解决的大问题。怎样解决？厂革委会和驻军同志作了研究，学习了毛主席关于“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习”的教导，确定举办毛主席著作学习班，用伟大的毛泽东思想来统一人们的思想认识。
    第一期学习班在七月十五日正式办起来。这一期集中了车间联络员六十多人。
    学习班开始第一课，是讲述伟大领袖毛主席的英明、伟大，讲述毛主席的革命路线无比正确。学员们热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情提到了一个新的高度，产生了学习毛泽东思想的强烈要求。他们学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，学习了光辉的“老三篇”，学习了文化大革命的有关文件。这中间，革委会成员和解放军同志，同学员进行了个别交谈和家庭访问。
    通过学习讨论，大家认识到：无产阶级革命派，必须掌好权、用好权，将革命进行到底，这是阶级斗争的需要。革命派要勇挑重担，决不能怕困难。
    在学习讨论中，他们以“老三篇”中的三个光辉形象为镜子，以“完全”“彻底”四个字为尺子，对照自己，衡量自己。他们挖出了隐藏在怕困难、发牢骚、要辞职背后的“私”字，狠斗了这个“私”字，下定了全心全意为人民服务的决心。
    这期间，革委会向学员推荐了两个典型人物：一个是装配车间的联络员，一个是小组的联络员。装配车间的联络员，经常是头一天就考虑第二天的工作，第二天清早带一条毛主席的有关语录进车间，组织群众学习，发动和依靠群众完成任务。小组的联络员认真学习毛主席著作，事事以身作则带动群众，全组革命和生产都很出色。这两个用毛泽东思想指导自己行动、破私立公、任劳任怨的联络员，为大家树立了活的样板。
    这样，学员们统一了思想，明确了方向，看到了榜样，取得了经验，工作信心倍增。
    把基层干部的积极性充分调动起来
    车辆厂革委会和驻军同志，尝到了办学习班的甜头，于是决定继续办下去。
    接着举办了小组联络员参加的学习班。这一期的办法和第一期相同，收到的效果也相同。
    联络员的问题解决了，第三期，开办了车间和班组小组长、安全福利员参加的学习班。举办这期学习班，厂革委会是出于这样的考虑：只有联络员的积极性，而没有小组长和安全福利员的积极协作，革命和生产也难以顺利开展。而在当时，小组长和安全福利员中间，有革命派，也有一度受蒙蔽的群众，虽然他们开始回到毛主席的革命路线上来，仍然需要对他们进行教育和帮助。
　　这期学习的内容，大体仍然和第一期相同。毛主席的伟大榜样，毛主席的光辉思想，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的教育，深深触动了学员们的灵魂。有的生产组长，过去和联络员不团结，在学习班上主动做了自我批评。有的在学习班结业之前，抽空回到小组，检查了自己对革命事业不负责任的错误思想。毛泽东思想改变了这期学员的精神面貌。从此，车间、小组之间，团结加强了，为无产阶级革命事业而共同战斗的气氛浓厚了，革命大批判和生产，都向前跨了一大步。
    但是，这一期在总结的方法上不同于过去。上两期学习班的总结，是由厂革委会的少数人来做，有条理，然而不能充分反映学员们经过学习之后，无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想的心情和他们精神面貌的变化。因此，第三期开始，改由学员自己总结，人人谈学习的收获和体会。这种总结，非常生动感人。人们争先发言。有的老工人，简短几句话，就表达了对毛主席、对党、对革命事业的一片赤胆忠心。这种总结，实际上又是一次活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，是互相交流，互相促进，共同提高的大课堂。
    帮助受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟提高觉悟
    这以后举办的一期学习班，学员是受蒙蔽较深、还没有参加联合会的群众。
    他们当时的思想状况是：有人觉得自己在文化大革命中站错了队，又出过“点子”攻击革命派，前途可悲，单等运动后期处理，因而相当消沉；有人自以为是真心实意干革命，听不得“受蒙蔽”三个字，他们对革命派不服气，工作、生产不积极；还有少数人继续对革命大联合持反对态度。
    对他们应该怎么办？革委会进行了两天的讨论。他们分析，这些人之中，老工人居多，绝大多数出身好，是阶级兄弟。他们由于受资产阶级反动路线毒害太深，一时还没有醒悟过来。对他们，绝不能采取歧视态度，必须热情帮助，而最好的办法是组织他们参加学习班学习。
    革委会成员统一认识之后，发出了通知。开始，他们不来。他们认为，这是有意要“整人”。革委会成员和解放军同志，耐心地进行了个别谈话，向他们表明了态度，说明使阶级兄弟形成对立的祸根是中国的赫鲁晓夫，热切地希望他们参加学习。最后他们同意了，但仍有人表示，“如果整我们，就走！”
    革委会采取了完全相信群众的态度，充分相信伟大的毛泽东思想一定能使这些受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟醒悟过来。学习班一开始，就由学员自己编组，自选组长，自己记录，如果还有疑虑，可以不作记录。革委会负责人，和他们一起学习，一起亮思想，斗私心，并且处处关怀他们。
    这一期，着重学习了毛主席关于两条路线斗争的论述。大家自觉对照检查自己，觉悟大大提高了一步。一度执行资产阶级反动路线又觉悟较早的本厂的一个干部，来到学习班现身说法，谈到自己的教训，分析了两条路线斗争的实质。这使大家进一步醒悟过来。他们纷纷进行自我批评，许多人甚至痛哭流涕，讲述毛主席如何解救了自己的一家，而自己在文化大革命中竟然没有站在毛主席的革命路线一边，和阶级兄弟长期对立，真正对不起毛主席。随着觉悟的提高，他们更加热爱毛主席，更加痛恨中国的赫鲁晓夫。他们坚决表示，一定和资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    这一期参加学习的共四十七人，学习结束时，每人都提出参加联合会的申请。这对全厂革命大联合的进一步巩固，起了相当的作用。
    将小资产阶级思想引上无产阶级轨道
    受蒙蔽群众的问题解决了，这时另一个突出的问题，是革命派中间一部分人的小资产阶级思想泛滥的问题。
    这个厂的革命派中间，有一小部分人，主要是年青人，他们由于没能担任联络员，情绪发生波动，革命干劲削弱了，劳动纪律松弛了。他们又以“老造反”自居，听不得同志们的批评意见。
    对于这些年青人，厂革委会专门组织了一期学习班。但是，这一期的学员不同于前几期。讲道理，他们似乎已经懂得；讨论问题，他们坐不下来；学习“老三篇”，许多人又能流水般地背诵给你听。因此，学习班开始进展很慢。这时，革委会请来两位老工人，用自己苦难的家史，用解放前后的对比，对学员进行了一次深刻的阶级教育。阶级教育，一抓就灵。老工人的回忆对比，激发了青年人对新社会的热爱，对旧社会的仇恨，对毛主席的无比热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。
    这时，他们自己编了组，选了组长，自己管理自己。再没有一个人迟到或早退，学习变得非常认真，道理也能细心领会。他们用毛主席的教导来对照检查自己。许多人大挖自己情绪动荡的根源，大摆带着“私”字干革命的危害。也有人检查自己由于有“革命成功”的思想而“逍遥”起来。他们深切感到自己平日的表现违背了毛主席的教导，决心铲除“私”字，赶上文化大革命的步伐。
    通过学习，找到了病根，狠触了灵魂，学员们结业后一反往日状态，各方面都变得积极起来。
    从教育入手解决中层以上的干部问题
    这时，毛主席视察华北、中南、华东地区时的最新指示下达了，林彪副主席关于大办毛泽东思想学习班的号召发出了。车辆厂革委会决心逐条贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，更加努力办好毛泽东思想学习班。
    革委会研究了本厂的情况，认为当前必须抓紧解决干部问题。
    这个厂的中层以上干部，在文化大革命初期，有些人执行了资产阶级反动路线，虽然以后对资产阶级反动路线进行了批判，多数干部已经解放出来，但是他们之中，有些人工作不大胆，重担不敢挑，甚至还有怨气，有抵触情绪。
    革委会组织了干部参加的学习班，从教育入手，解决干部思想问题。学习班以毛主席的最新指示为指南，引导学员们斗私批修。学员们学习文件，提高认识，自己提出问题，自己解决。他们许多人对比革命小将和自己在文化大革命中的贡献，越比越觉得自己必须向革命小将学习。他们回忆党和毛主席对自己的培养教育和革命群众对自己的帮助，越回忆越觉得对不起党和毛主席，对不起革命群众。他们检查自己对群众的态度，检查自己当前的革命干劲，越检查越觉得自己辜负了毛主席的教导，背离了毛主席的革命路线。在回忆、检查中，许多人热泪盈眶，感情十分激动。他们纷纷表示，一定彻底改造世界观，一定紧跟毛主席闹革命。
    看清了自己的现状之后，许多人又检查了在文化大革命中，自己怎样从“私”字出发，怕犯错误，结果真正犯了错误，现在又是怎样认识了错误，以及应该从中吸取的教训。这样，他们真正从思想上划清了两条路线的界限。
    过去，不少干部对自己所犯错误的认识不深刻，怨气不能消除。经过这次学习，思想通了，怨气消了，革命干劲大大增加。他们纷纷深入第一线，和群众一起抓革命促生产。群众纷纷反映：干部经过学习班学习，大变样了！
    这期学习班，不仅使已经解放的干部从思想上得到了进一步提高，并且对还没有站起来的干部，也起了促进的作用。
    把车间革委会建立在坚实的群众基础上
    车辆厂的中层以上干部共有三十四名。厂一级干部，已有三名站了出来，其中两名参加了厂革命委员会的领导班子。干部参加的学习班结业以后，厂革委会考虑了车间一级革委会的问题。成立车间革委会，一种办法是由厂革委会任命，另一种办法是经过群众选举。车辆厂采用的是后者。
    为了使车间革委会成为革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构，厂革委会仍然举办了毛泽东思想学习班。他们根据毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人五项条件的要求，组织了一批新老干部参加学习，同时吸收一部分职工群众参加。
    这期学习班，同样以“斗私，批修”为纲，学员们以对无产阶级革命事业高度负责的精神，亮私，斗私，提高觉悟，提高认识。他们畅谈大好形势，对光辉的革命前程充满无限信心。他们反复学习“老三篇”，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。学习班的情况，随时向各车间反映，使广大革命职工对这些学员增加了更多的了解。
    学习结业之后，经过群众选举，各车间革委会产生了。这样的车间革委会，由于有了充分的思想基础和群众基础，威信高，有效地领导了本车间的革命和生产的大事。
    革委会成员在群众帮助下不断革命化
    最近，车辆厂革委会正在举办第十二期学习班。这期学习班的学员，是厂革委会全体成员。
    车辆厂通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，逐步解决了本厂大量的突出的问题。但是，这个厂的革命委员会并不满足这些成就，他们根据元旦社论的精神，决定用高标准来检查贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的情况，真正做到逐条地、全面地、不折不扣地落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
    为了听取群众的批评意见，这期学习班邀请了各车间的一名老工人参加。
    在学习班里，学员们反复学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，谈自己的认识，谈本厂的实际，暴露自己的私心杂念，同时开展批评和自我批评。
    经过检查，他们找出了和毛主席最新指示的一些差距，归纳起来就是：
    派性。全厂虽然早已实现革命大联合，并且消除了对立情绪，但是，在革命造反较早和较晚的人们之间，在革命派和一度受蒙蔽群众之间，有些人仍有此亲彼疏的感情流露出来。在部分群众中有这种现象，在少数委员中也有这种现象。
    正确对待干部问题。革命派中的一部分人，对待已经站出来的干部，还不够放心，还不敢大胆使用。
    干部本身的问题。已经参加三结合的少数干部，仍被“私”字缠身，不敢大胆工作，怕再犯错误。
    在学习班上，参加学习的老工人，尖锐地提出了一些批评意见。他们批评几名常委最近一段时间参加劳动少了，对病号、老工人访问少了；他们希望厂革委会负责人经常下去走走、看看，和群众更广泛地接触。他们特别希望厂革委会对各单位学习毛主席著作的计划进行经常的检查。
    对于检查出来的这些问题和老工人提出的批评，厂革委会非常重视，决心彻底改正。因此，他们决定，委员们在学习结束后全部到车间去，带着这期学习班的情况，带着自己的问题，亮私斗私，为群众作出样子，由群众监督改正。同时，发动群众继续提出批评，提出问题，为进一步更扎实地落实毛主席的最新指示打下新的基础。
    在第十二期学习班以前，车辆厂还举办过另外几期毛泽东思想学习班。例如：
    他们按照毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，举办过民兵参加的学习班。
    他们根据毛主席关于整顿党的组织、加强党的建设的最新指示，举办了两期有党员、革命派和老工人参加的学习班，学习毛主席的建党学说，批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线，为这个厂的整顿党的组织、加强党的建设的工作，做了一定的准备。
    青岛车辆厂举办毛泽东思想学习班，确确实实大有成效，很多问题在学习班得到了解决；确确实实受到群众的欢迎。许多学员在结业时都要求：下一期再让我来！这个厂的革命干部和广大群众一致的决心是：毛泽东思想学习班，一定继续办下去，永远办下去，让毛主席的一系列最新指示落实、再落实，让伟大的毛泽东思想在人们的头脑中扎根、再扎根！
