The machinery industry in our country has achieved new successes in implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "seize the revolution and promote production." The largest domestically designed set of large cement rotary kilns has been successfully manufactured. This set of kilns can produce 300,000 tons of cement annually. After single-machine operation tests, it has been proven that the mechanical performance and manufacturing quality of this equipment are excellent. Its successful manufacture marks a new level in our country's technology for manufacturing cement equipment.

This large cement rotary kiln was manufactured by the Lanzhou Petroleum Chemical Machinery Plant. It is a major achievement of the revolutionary workers of the entire plant in resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." The technical personnel responsible for designing this large cement rotary kiln have an average age of only around twenty, and most of them are designing a cement kiln for the first time.

    兰州制造的大型水泥回转窑质量良好
    我国机械工业战线在贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示中取得了新的成就：我国自行设计的最大的一套大型水泥回转窑制造成功了。这套水泥回转窑可以年产三十万吨水泥。经过单机运转试验证明，这套设备的机械性能和制造质量良好。它的制造成功，标志着我国制造水泥设备的技术提高到了一个新的水平。
    这套大型水泥回转窑是兰州石油化工机器厂制造的。它是全厂革命职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的重大成果。担任设计这套大型水泥回转窑任务的技术人员，平均年龄只有二十几岁，多数还是头一次搞水泥窑设计工作。
