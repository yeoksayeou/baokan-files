After pointing out the desperate situation facing the pseudo-army in the regions of Quang Tri, Thua Thien, and Hue, the call to arms states: The only way out for the pseudo-army in this region is to turn their guns, stand on the side of the revolution, and join the people in opposing the American aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique. Only this path can save their lives and redeem their sins.

The call to arms urges the pseudo-army in the regions of Quang Tri, Thua Thien, and Hue to quickly desert the enemy ranks and contribute to the glorious cause of the South Vietnamese people's struggle to save the nation and fight the Americans.

Large numbers of pseudo-army soldiers and officers who have turned to the light have joined this brigade and are fighting alongside the people to save the nation and fight the Americans.

After its establishment, the brigade issued a call to arms. The call to arms states that the only way out for South Vietnamese pseudo-army soldiers and officers is to turn their guns, turn to the light, and join the people in striking at the American aggressors and their lackey, the Vietnamese traitor clique, to redeem their sins and contribute to the cause of the struggle to save the nation and fight the Americans. The call to arms urges pseudo-army soldiers and officers to quickly surrender to the people and the liberation army, eliminate the villains, and join various pseudo-army rebel organizations to contribute to the cause of the struggle to save the nation and fight the Americans.
