    The Bankruptcy of Lies
    Panic, anxiety, fear, and desperation—this is the reaction in (Washington) to the news from Vietnam.
    Over the past three months, Americans have been deceiving themselves. They have been telling themselves lies that the war will "subside" because the communists "have no more strength." They have been boasting about the "security" in South Vietnam, the "achievements" of their army, the "strength" of their South Vietnamese allies (i.e., the South Vietnamese puppet regime), and the "progress" in democratization...

    None of this is true; it is all the opposite. In some key areas under the control of the U.S. military, there is no "security" to speak of. The "weakening" of the Viet Cong (referring to the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam) is a propaganda lie of the Americans.

    谎言的破产
    惊慌、焦虑、恐惧、走投无路、几乎绝望，这就是（华盛顿）对来自越南的消息的反应。
    美国人在过去三个月中自己欺骗了自己。他们自欺欺人地说，战争将会“减弱”，因为共产党“已没有力量了”。他们大谈其在南越的“安全”、他们军队的“成就”、他们的南越盟友（即南越傀儡集团）的“实力”和民主化方面的“进步”……
    其中没有一点东西是真实的，而是恰好相反。在美国军队控制的某些要地，根本谈不上“安全”。越共（指越南南方人民解放武装力量）的“削弱”是美国的一种宣传谎言。
