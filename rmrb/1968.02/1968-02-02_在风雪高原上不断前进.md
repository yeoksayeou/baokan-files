	Advancing Through the Wind and Snow on the Plateau
	"Chuan-Zang Line Iron Transport Team" Team Leader Huang Chaowen, Five Good Soldier Wei Chunde

	The Chinese Khrushchev relentlessly promotes the idea that as long as one works hard, one can become a hero, a model, and have a bright future. Look! He talks about revolution with his mouth, but in his heart, it's all about himself. This is the stinking philosophy of bourgeois individualism. Are we doing the revolution for personal glory? No! The drivers of Chairman Mao's cars have been fighting on the plateau year-round, not for fame, not for personal gain, but to "work wholeheartedly for the people's interests."

	A revolutionary believes that the honor given by the Party and the people is an encouragement and a spur, a higher demand, a starting point and a driving force for our progress, rather than a capital for arrogance and self-satisfaction or for personal gain. In 1964, the Ministry of National Defense conferred the honorable title of "Chuan-Zang Line Iron Transport Team" on our team, which greatly inspired us. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one go forward, while conceit makes one lag behind." In the storms of class struggle and production struggle, we study Chairman Mao's works earnestly, reform our worldview, and correctly handle honors. On the thousands of miles of the Chuan-Zang Line, we drive over cliffs and precipices as if they were nothing, and we face wind and snow with ease. The whole team faces difficulties head-on, shuns honors, and overcomes obstacles, driving for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Every time we turn the steering wheel and press the accelerator, we think not of honors, but of the revolution and the people; not of being responsible to honors, but of being responsible to the people. We feel that with the steering wheel of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, the road of revolution becomes wider and wider, and the wheels of revolution roll faster and faster. We have successfully completed the transport mission for war preparedness, safely driving 1,650,000 kilometers, and the team has been rated as four-good every year, with everyone being a five-good soldier. However, comrades say: "The honor given to us by the Party and the people is too high, and our contribution to the revolution is never enough. We are determined to devote our limited lives to the boundless revolutionary cause and be transport soldiers for the people on the windy and snowy plateau for life."

	The Chinese Khrushchev promotes the idea of "being a hero" and "being a model" to lead our young generation into the dead end of individual struggle, self-interest, seeking fame and profit. We must firmly hold the steering wheel of Mao Zedong Thought, driving the rolling wheels of revolution forward, and smash the Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois worldview he peddles, making them fall flat on their faces and be crushed to pieces. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance through the wind and snow on the plateau, forever preserve our revolutionary youth, and strive to achieve new merits for the people.

    在风雪高原上不断前进
   “川藏线上钢铁运输班”班长　黄朝文　五好战士　韦纯德
    中国赫鲁晓夫拚命鼓吹什么只要好好工作，“当英雄”，“当模范”，“前途就很大”。看！嘴上说为革命，骨子里是为自己，这是臭不可闻的资产阶级个人主义哲学。我们干革命为的是个人荣誉吗？不！毛主席的汽车兵，常年战斗在高原上，一不为名，二不为利，“是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”。
    一个革命者认为，党和人民给我们的荣誉，是对我们的鼓励和鞭策，是向我们提出更高的要求，是我们前进的起点和动力，而决不是骄傲自满和捞取私利的资本。一九六四年，国防部授予我们班“川藏线上钢铁运输班”光荣称号，使我们受到极大鼓舞。我们牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，在阶级斗争和生产斗争的风浪中，活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观，正确对待荣誉。在几千里的川藏线上，我们悬崖绝壁飞车过，风雪严寒只等闲。全班同志见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见障碍就闯，一心为中国革命和世界革命开车。同志们每打一把方向盘，每踏一脚油门，想到的不是为荣誉，而是为革命、为人民；不是向荣誉负责，而是向人民负责。我们体会到，头脑里有了毛泽东思想的方向盘，革命大道越走越宽，革命车轮越飞越快。我们胜利完成了战备运输任务，安全行驶一百六十五万公里，全班年年评为四好，人人都是五好战士。但是同志们却说：“党和人民给我们的荣誉太高，我们对革命的贡献永远不满足。我们决心把有限的生命投入到无限的革命事业中去，在风雪高原上当一辈子人民的运输兵。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“当英雄”“当模范”，是要把我们青年一代引向个人奋斗，一心为己，追名求利的死胡同。我们要紧握毛泽东思想的方向盘，驾驶着滚滚向前的革命车轮，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他所贩卖的资产阶级世界观，撞个人仰马翻，碾个粉身碎骨。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在风雪高原上不断前进，永葆革命青春，努力为人民立新功。
