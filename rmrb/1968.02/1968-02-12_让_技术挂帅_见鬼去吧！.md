To hell with "technical leadership"!

The San Tiao Shi Old Workers' Criticism Group and the Mechanical Casting Factory Criticism Group

The Chinese Khrushchev says: "In the future, when we build a new China, everyone will manage the country, and then technical work will be of primary importance." "As long as you master one skill, you will become famous and successful, and you will have everything." These words are very familiar to many of us old workers because, in the old society, when we were apprentices, we often heard the capitalists say similar things, such as "As long as you have skills, you won't be afraid of anything, you'll have a good life, you'll make a lot of money, and you'll travel the world." The Chinese Khrushchev's words and the capitalists' words are indeed from the same mold!

Why does the Chinese Khrushchev, along with the capitalists, urge us to focus on learning skills? They both have sinister and despicable intentions. The capitalists' goal is, first, to extend the period of exploitation of apprentices. When we entered the San Tiao Shi Iron Works, the "contract" stated: "The apprenticeship period is four years." However, after four years, the capitalists insisted that the skills were not mastered and did not allow us to graduate. Because once graduated, we would have to be paid wages. Second, they want apprentices to obediently endure the capitalists' oppression and exploitation, making apprentices endure a humiliating life of oppression and exploitation in order to learn skills. Third, the capitalists use this trick of learning skills to win hearts and minds, making workers detached from politics. Because they know that if workers participate in political struggles, they will rise up to resist the capitalists' oppression and exploitation and overthrow the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie.

The Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the fallacy of "technical leadership" is an attempt to cancel out the great leader Chairman Mao's correct guidance that politics is the commander and the soul, leading young people down the dead-end road of "expertise without politics" to cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without correct political views, it is as if one has no soul." Detaching from politics and focusing only on skills is completely wrong. Learning skills must first emphasize politics, and everything must be led by politics; otherwise, one will go astray. We, the workers of San Tiao Shi, deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength and a treasure trove of wisdom. As long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, we can create any miracle in the world. Take the situation in San Tiao Shi, for example. Under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, in the eighteen years since liberation, our factories have produced many products at the world's advanced level. In the old society, San Tiao Shi's industry crawled for over eighty years, only able to produce simple products by hand. However, in the eighteen years since liberation, it has far surpassed the eighty-plus years before liberation. The machinery and equipment of various factories in San Tiao Shi are developing towards automation and semi-automation, and the high-precision products produced not only strongly support the socialist construction of the motherland but also aid in the construction of brotherly countries.

Mao Zedong Thought is the all-powerful key. When we encounter technical difficulties, we first consult Chairman Mao's works. For example, there are a few large water gates in Hebei Province, which are large and cumbersome. When they were transported to the machinery factory in San Tiao Shi for processing, we felt a pile of difficulties when we first saw this giant object. However, facing numerous difficulties, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." Thus, everyone eagerly took on this glorious task. In the end, we adopted the method of ants gnawing on bones and completed the processing of the large water gates on time and with quality.

The stark contrast between the two societies and our personal experiences makes us deeply feel the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the workers of San Tiao Shi, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to break through many technical difficulties, and once again thoroughly refuted the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of "technical leadership."

    让“技术挂帅”见鬼去吧！
    三条石老工人批判组机械铸造厂批判小组
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“我们将来建设新中国，要大家管理国家，那时技术工作就要占首要地位”，“只要学好一门专长，将来会成名成家，就有了一切”。这些话，我们许多老工人听着非常耳熟，因为在旧社会学徒时，就经常听到资本家说过类似的话，什么“只要有技术，什么也不怕，吃香的，喝辣的，赚大钱，走遍天下。”中国赫鲁晓夫的话和资本家的话，真是一个模子里铸出来的货色！
    中国赫鲁晓夫为什么和资本家异口同声地劝我们埋头学技术呢？他们都有不可告人的卑鄙目的。资本家的目的，一是为了延长对徒工的剥削期。我们在进三条石铁工厂时，“卖身契”上写着：“学徒期限四年为满”。可是四年以后，资本家硬说技术没学好，不叫出师。因为一出师就要拿工钱了。二是叫徒工服服贴贴地受资本家压迫和剥削，使徒工为了学技术，就得忍受被压迫被剥削的屈辱生活。三是资本家用学技术这套鬼花招，笼络人心，让工人脱离政治。因为他们知道，工人参加政治斗争，就要起来反抗资本家的压迫和剥削，推翻资产阶级的反动统治了。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“技术挂帅”的谬论，是妄图取消伟大领袖毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的英明教导，把青年人拉进“白专”道路的死胡同，为资产阶级培养接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”脱离政治，只搞技术是完全错误的。学技术要首先突出政治，事事要政治挂帅，否则就会走到邪路上去。我们三条石工人深深体会到，毛泽东思想是力量的源泉，智慧的宝库，只要掌握了毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。就拿三条石的情况来说吧，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引下，解放十八年来，我们各厂制造出很多世界先进水平的产品。三条石的工业在旧社会爬了八十多年，只能用手工生产一些简单产品，可是，解放后的十八年，远远超过了解放前的八十多年，三条石各厂的机器设备正朝着自动化、半自动化发展，生产出来的高级精密产品，不但有力地支持了祖国的社会主义建设，还支援了兄弟国家的建设。
    毛泽东思想是万能的金钥匙。我们三条石工人在遇到技术难关时，首先去请教毛主席著作。如河北省有几座大水库的大闸门，体积大，很笨重，运到三条石的机器厂进行加工，当我们刚看见这个庞然大物时，也曾感到困难一大堆。但是，在重重困难面前，我们学习了毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”于是，大家争先恐后地承担这项光荣任务。最后终于采取蚂蚁啃骨头的办法，保质保量地提前完成了大闸门的加工任务。
    两种社会，两种亲身经历的强烈对比，使我们深深体会到毛泽东思想威力无穷。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们三条石工人热烈响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，攻破了很多技术难关，又一次狠狠地驳倒了中国赫鲁晓夫的“技术挂帅”的反动谬论。
