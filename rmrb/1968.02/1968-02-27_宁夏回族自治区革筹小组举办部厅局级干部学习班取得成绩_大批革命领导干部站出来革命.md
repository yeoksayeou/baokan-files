The Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region recently held the first training class for department-level cadres, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a guide and focusing on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" to help cadres correctly view themselves and the masses. They voluntarily went among the masses to examine and correct their own mistakes and bravely stood up for the revolution.

Eighty-one department-level cadres from the autonomous region participated in this training class. They have generally been engaged in revolutionary work for about thirty years, and although they have done some beneficial work for the revolution, some have made various mistakes to different degrees, and some have carried out the bourgeois reactionary line. The training class leadership, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "handle cadre issues by starting with education and expanding the scope of education," organized them to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles." They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles" as a powerful driving force to help them consciously engage in criticizing and repudiating revisionism. This helped them better understand and grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, correctly view themselves and the masses, and seriously summarize their experiences and lessons. At the same time, the training class adopted a method of combining internal and external efforts. On the one hand, they inspired the cadres to, with an unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, consciously engage in revolution in the depths of their souls; on the other hand, they encouraged them to boldly go among the masses to expose and criticize their private thoughts, sincerely accept the masses' criticism and help. For cadres with more mistakes and greater mass opinions, they allowed them to check with the masses first, bring the masses' opinions back to the training class, further study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, raise their awareness, and then go for another check. This method of closely combining study in the training class with checking among the masses, and combining self-examination with mass help, not only helped the cadres deeply recognize their mistakes and summarize the experiences and lessons of their mistakes, but also enabled them to quickly gain the masses' understanding.

Among the participating cadres, some originally had heavier thoughts, fearing that the masses would not understand, fearing that the masses would exaggerate their mistakes, etc. Therefore, some were cautious when exposing and criticizing their private thoughts in the training class, doing so half-heartedly. The training class, based on this situation, organized the cadres to, with their living thoughts, seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues and the "Three Articles," recall and compare their standpoints, views, words, and deeds that did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, and inspire everyone to consciously dig deep into the "self" in their minds. In this way, everyone studied with more vigor, more confidence, and a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions.

Many comrades, through study, realized that the fundamental reason for their past mistakes was that they had not studied Chairman Mao's works well and seriously transformed their worldview. Usually, they only regarded themselves as a revolutionary force, not as a revolutionary object. When they made mistakes, they could not correctly face them and seriously engage in self-criticism. They resolutely declared that they would strive to transform their worldview and follow the great leader Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution. Some comrades said that they would not rely on past merits and would strive to achieve new merits for the people.

After raising their revolutionary consciousness, many comrades replaced the "fear" with "dare" when examining their mistakes, doing so with "three nos" and "three finds," that is, not emphasizing objective factors, not discussing specific issues, and not avoiding heavy issues; finding from themselves, from historical and class roots, and from the line struggle. Some comrades who originally thought they had no shortcomings or mistakes also correctly viewed themselves with a dialectical perspective, strictly demanded of themselves, and faced their shortcomings and mistakes.

During the study period, the cadres actively sought opinions from the masses, especially from those with the most opinions, sincerely accepting the masses' criticism and help, and receiving good evaluations from the masses.

Through the study, most of these cadres have basically gained the masses' understanding. After returning to their original units, some have been accepted by the revolutionary masses as objects of the "three-in-one combination," and some have been absorbed as members of the revolutionary committees of their units.

    宁夏回族自治区革筹小组举办部厅局级干部学习班取得成绩
    大批革命领导干部站出来革命
    据新华社银川二十四日电　宁夏回族自治区革命委员会筹备小组，最近举办第一期部、厅、局级干部毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席最新指示为指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，帮助干部正确对待自己，正确对待群众，自觉地到群众中去检查和改正自己的错误，勇敢地站出来革命。
    参加这期学习班的八十一名自治区部、厅、局级干部，参加革命工作一般都在三十年左右，过去都为革命作过一些有益的工作，但有些人也程度不同地犯有这样或那样的错误，有的执行过资产阶级反动路线。学习班领导遵循毛主席的“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的教导，组织他们认真学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，把毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”作为推动他们自觉地进行斗私批修的强大动力，帮助他们更好地理解和掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，正确对待自己，正确对待群众，认真总结经验教训。同时，学习班采取内外结合的办法，一面启发他们以无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情，自觉地在灵魂深处闹革命；一面鼓励他们大胆地到群众中去亮私斗私，诚恳地接受群众的批评和帮助。对错误较多、群众意见较大的干部，让他们在群众中检查后，把群众意见带回学习班，进一步学习毛主席的有关教导，提高认识，然后再去作检查。这种把在学习班里学习和在群众中检查密切结合起来，把自觉检查和群众帮助密切结合起来的作法，既能帮助干部比较深刻地认识自己的错误，总结自己犯错误的经验教训，又能使他们较快地得到群众的谅解。
    在参加学习的这些干部中，原来有些人思想顾虑较重，怕群众不谅解，怕群众对自己的错误无限上纲，等等。因此，有的在学习班上亮私斗私时，小心翼翼，斗得不痛不痒。学习班根据这种情况，组织干部带着自己的活思想，认真学习毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示和“老三篇”，回忆和对照自己的立场观点、言论行动有哪些不符合毛主席的教导，启发大家自觉深挖头脑中的“私”字。这样，大家越学越有劲，越学信心越足，越学越体会到毛主席的指示英明伟大。
    许多同志通过学习，认识到过去犯错误的根本原因，是没有很好地学习毛主席著作，认真改造世界观。平时只是把自己当作革命的力量，没有同时把自己当作革命的对象。产生了缺点错误，又不能正确地对待，认真进行自我批评。他们坚决表示要努力改造世界观，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席革命到底。有些同志表示，绝不能再吃老本，要为人民立新功。
    革命的自觉性提高以后，许多同志就把“怕”字换成了“敢”字，在检查自己的错误时做到“三不”、“三找”，即不强调客观，不就事论事，不避重就轻；从自己身上找，从历史根源和阶级根源上找，从两条路线斗争的纲上找。有些原来认为自己没有什么缺点错误的同志，也以一分为二的观点正确对待自己，严格要求自己，正视自己的缺点错误。
    在学习期间，干部们纷纷主动地到群众中去征求意见，特别是到意见最多的群众中去征求意见，诚恳地接受群众的批判和帮助，受到群众的好评。
    通过学习，这些干部中绝大多数人已经基本上取得了群众的谅解。回到原单位后，有的已被革命群众接受作为革命三结合的对象，有的已被吸收为本单位革命委员会的成员。
