	Implementing Mao Zedong Thought as the Guideline for Spring Ploughing

	The Militia of Jiaoqiao Strives with Revolutionary Spirit to Achieve Remarkable Results in Spring Production

	From our correspondent

	As the spring ploughing season of 1968 approaches, the broad masses of militia and poor and lower-middle peasants of the "Red Flag Militia Regiment" of Jiaoqiao, Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, have, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," swiftly launched a new high tide in spring production.

	Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions Thoroughly

	In the spring production, the militia and poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiaoqiao have first and foremost focused on thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions the guideline for spring production. The militia and cadres of Dongfeng Brigade have, in the spring production, achieved five "to the fields": First, bringing the great thought of Mao Zedong to the fields. Everyone voluntarily brings Chairman Mao's latest instructions and works of Chairman Mao to the fields for study and application at any time. Second, moving the classrooms for studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions from indoors to the fields. Third, organizing propaganda teams to the fields. Loudspeakers, blackboards, and quotation boards for propagating Mao Zedong Thought are brought to the fields by designated persons; the cultural and entertainment teams for propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions also go to the fields to enthusiastically propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Fourth, holding experience-sharing and study sessions in the fields. Every day, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they check and discuss the day's labor, sharing experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Fifth, conducting ideological work in the fields. Cadres go deep into the front lines of spring production, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to solve ideological issues in spring production and direct spring production.

	"Break" First, Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism

	Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction." The militia of Jiaoqiao deeply understands that the key to winning the battle of spring production this year lies in "breaking first," thoroughly settling accounts with the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in restoring capitalism in the countryside, eliminating the poison of his advocacy for "material incentives" and "work points first," shattering the spiritual shackles that bind the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, and igniting the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm and vigor of all revolutionary masses. From the beginning of spring production, the militia regiment of Hongwu Brigade has focused on and thoroughly criticized the revisionist black goods pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev in the countryside, mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of militia and poor and lower-middle peasants. The deputy squad leader of the third militia squad, Tang Guofang, to solve the problem of insufficient base fertilizer for spring production, in the heavy snow and temperatures dropping to minus nine degrees Celsius, broke through half a foot of frozen soil, and dug out all the bottom dirt from the pig, sheep, and chicken pens.

	The militia regiment of Dunli Brigade, from the beginning of spring production, launched a mass discussion on the issue of "for whom to till the land and which road to take," in which they fiercely criticized and repudiated the fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, making the broad masses of militia and cadres realize that they must all care for the collective and establish the idea of being masters of the revolution. The militia member Yuan Guoyin of the second militia squad originally signed a contract with a brigade in Dongtai County to go out to cut grass for sideline production; later, through the discussion on the issue of "for whom to till the land and which road to take," he raised his awareness, canceled the original contract, and firmly guarded his production post. Under his influence, several other team members who went out for sideline production also returned to the team to focus on spring production, making the team's agricultural work all ahead of schedule.

	With Great Enthusiasm, Striving for the Forefront, Self-Reliance, and Focusing on Spring Production

	In spring production, the militia of Jiaoqiao also criticized the lazy thought of "after the Lantern Festival, everyone goes their own way," broke through the old institutions and frameworks that hinder spring production, established a new set of institutions that emphasize politics in spring production, and, with the revolutionary spirit of striving for the forefront, threw themselves into the fiery spring production struggle. Many militia regiments' militia members and cadres changed the old habit of resting during the Spring Festival, firmly guarded their production posts, and focused on early spring field management and preparation for sowing.

	The militia members of the ninth militia squad of Wuhu Brigade faced the difficulty of a large shortage of base fertilizer for spring production. Carrying the question of "relying on others or solving problems by oneself," they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching on "among cadres, the psychology of not going through one's own arduous struggle and shedding blood and sweat, but relying on unexpected convenience and winning by chance, must be completely eliminated." Everyone unanimously agreed that they should follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "self-reliance," mobilize their own strength, and solve problems. Through democratic discussion, they formulated methods of "accumulating, managing, and using" and rational fertilizer use, and at the same time, relying on the masses' strength, they extensively sought fertilizer sources, launching a mass movement of accumulating natural fertilizers.

    把毛泽东思想作为春耕的行动准则
    角斜民兵用只争朝夕的革命精神抓春耕生产，取得显著效果
    本报讯　在一九六八年春耕季节到来的时候，江苏省海安县角斜“红旗民兵团”广大民兵、贫下中农，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，迅速掀起春耕生产新高潮。
    认真落实毛主席最新指示
    角斜民兵和贫下中农在春耕生产中，首先大抓狠抓毛主席最新指示的落实，使毛主席的最新指示成为指挥春耕生产的行动准则。东风大队民兵营广大民兵、干部在春耕生产中做到五到田头：第一，伟大的毛泽东思想到田头。人人都自觉地把伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和毛主席著作带到田头，随时随地学习运用。第二，学习毛主席最新指示的课堂由室内搬到田头。第三，宣传队伍组织到田头。土广播、黑板报、语录牌等宣传毛泽东思想的工具由专人负责带到田头；宣传毛主席最新指示的文娱队也到田头，热情宣传毛主席的最新指示。第四，心得交流讲用会开到田头。每天用毛主席的最新指示，对照检查一天的劳动情况，畅谈执行毛主席最新指示的体会。第五，活的思想工作跟到田头。广大干部深入到春耕生产第一线，用毛泽东思想为武器，解决春耕生产中的活思想问题，指挥春耕生产。
    “破”字当头　斗私批修
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“不破不立。”角斜民兵深深地认识到：打好今年春耕生产这一仗的关键，在于“破字当头”，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的罪行，肃清他宣扬“物质挂帅”、“工分第一”的流毒，打碎束缚广大群众革命积极性的精神枷锁，激发所有革命群众的最大革命热情和革命干劲。红武大队民兵营从春耕生产一开始，就大抓狠抓革命的大批判，深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村中推行的修正主义黑货，调动了广大民兵和贫下中农的生产积极性。第三民兵排副排长汤国芳，为了解决春耕生产基肥不足的困难，在大雪纷飞、气温降到了零下九度的严寒中，砸开半尺厚的冻土，把猪棚、羊棚、鸡棚的底泥全部挖了出来。
    墩里大队民兵营从春耕生产一开始，就展开了一场群众性的“为谁种田，走什么道路”问题的大讨论，在讨论中，狠批狠驳了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”“四大自由”的谬论，使广大民兵、干部认识到：一定要人人关心集体，树立为革命当家作主的思想。第二民兵排民兵袁国银原来和东台县一个大队订了合同，准备外出割草搞副业；后来，通过“为谁种田，走什么道路”问题的大讨论，提高了认识，取消了原来的合同，坚守生产岗位。在他带动下，其他几个外出搞副业的社员，也都回到队里来抓春耕了，使队里样样农活都赶在时间的前头。
    鼓足干劲　力争上游　自力更生　狠抓春耕
    角斜民兵在春耕生产中，还批判了“过了正月半，各人头路转”的懒汉思想，破除了阻碍春耕生产的旧制度、旧框框，建立了一套突出政治抓春耕的新制度，以鼓足干劲、力争上游的革命精神，投入火热的春耕生产斗争。许多民兵营的民兵、干部改变了过去春节休息的旧习惯，坚守生产岗位，大抓初春田间管理和备耕备种工作。
    五虎大队民兵营第九民兵排的民兵，面对春耕生产大量缺乏基肥的困难，带着“向上伸手还是依靠自己解决困难”的问题，反复学习了毛主席关于“干部中一切不经过自己艰苦奋斗、流血流汗，而依靠意外便利、侥幸取胜的心理，必须扫除干净”的教导。大家一致认识到应该按照毛主席“自力更生”的教导，发挥自己的力量，解决困难。他们通过民主讨论，制订了“积、管、养”和合理用肥的办法，同时依靠群众的力量，大找肥源，掀起了一个大积自然肥料的群众运动。
