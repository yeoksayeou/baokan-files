At the moment when the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have achieved great victories during the Lunar New Year, striking the U.S. aggressors into disarray, the heroic patriotic military and civilian people of Laos have also launched a new offensive against the running dogs of American imperialism, achieving brilliant results. Following their great victory in the Nambak battle, where nearly 3,000 enemy troops were annihilated, the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos launched a fierce attack on the rightist forces on February 3, capturing the enemy's military headquarters and liberating the entire Mong Hinh area, inflicting heavy casualties and losses on the enemy. The Lao comrades have fought well and fought beautifully! The Chinese people and revolutionary people all over the world enthusiastically cheer for your brilliant victories!

Under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the heroic patriotic military and civilian people of Laos have united in their hatred of the enemy and fought tenaciously, demonstrating the immense power of people's war and annihilating a large number of the enemy's fighting forces. The situation in the Lao revolutionary war is becoming increasingly favorable. In the past year, the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos fought in more than 1,800 battles, annihilating nearly 16,000 enemy troops and shooting down or destroying 287 enemy aircraft. Since the beginning of this year, the Lao military and civilian people have continued to fight tirelessly, advancing and taking the initiative to attack, continuously annihilating the enemy, and successively recapturing strategic strongholds such as Nambak and Hoi San that had been occupied by the enemy, opening up a new phase in the Lao people's war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The great victories of the Lao people in their war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation are great victories of people's war. At present, in the Southeast Asian region, especially on the Indochina Peninsula, the flames of people's war are burning fiercely, scorching the U.S. aggressors. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam are launching a full-scale offensive, striking at the heart of the U.S. and puppet forces, and continuing to pursue and expand their victories. The Thai people's guerrilla forces are also intensifying their new battles. The new victories of the Lao patriotic military and civilian people are another heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors. The battles of the peoples of the Indochina Peninsula against the U.S. aggressors, supporting and closely coordinating with each other, have formed a powerful iron fist encircling the U.S. aggressors. The American imperialist beast is struggling in this vast sea of people's war, on the verge of being swallowed up.

The U.S. aggressors, who have been beaten black and blue by the heroic Vietnamese people on the Vietnam battlefield, are still unwilling to accept their defeat and are trying to find a way out through escalating military adventurism. The further extension of American imperialism's claws of aggression into Laos is an important step in their attempt to expand the Vietnam War to the entire Indochina Peninsula. Recently, the United States has increased the dispatch of bandit aircraft to bomb the liberated areas of Laos, continuously using helicopters to transport so-called "special forces" composed of American, South Vietnamese, and Lao rightist military personnel to carry out sabotage activities in the liberated areas of Laos, transporting large quantities of weapons and military personnel into Laos, and building strategic roads on Lao territory near the Thai-Lao border. Under the pretext of "preventing North Vietnam from infiltrating South Vietnam," American imperialism is plotting to expand the Vietnam War into Laos.

However, the aggressive and warlike activities of American imperialism will not save it from its inevitable defeat in Vietnam and the entire Indochina Peninsula, but will only promote the broader involvement of the peoples of the Indochina Peninsula in the anti-imperialist struggle and accelerate the final downfall of American imperialism. The victorious development of the anti-U.S. war of the peoples of Vietnam and Laos, and the unfolding of the anti-U.S. struggle of the Cambodian people, are powerful proofs of this. As our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "Every place the U.S. imperialists invade, they put another noose around their own neck. They have already fallen into the encirclement of the people of the whole world."

The Lao people are a heroic people who have been tempered by long-term trials. Any military deployments and conspiratorial activities of American imperialism and its running dogs will be met with a bloody nose in the face of the Lao people. Prince Souphanouvong recently pointed out: "The Lao people will not be shaken by any threats and will not yield to any pressure. American imperialism is the aggressor of Laos. The Lao people must resolutely carry the struggle against the aggressors to the end." This is the solemn vow of the Lao people in their struggle for national liberation.

Now, the heroic Lao people are advancing in victory. We are deeply convinced that the Lao people will definitely overcome all difficulties, smash all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks, thoroughly defeat American imperialism and its running dogs, and ultimately achieve the liberation of the entire nation!

    欢呼老挝人民抗美救国战争的新胜利
    本报评论员
    正当越南南方军民获得新春大捷，把美国侵略者打得七零八落的时候，英雄的老挝爱国军民也对美帝国主义的走狗发动了新的进攻，取得了辉煌的战果。老挝爱国军民继在南博战役中获得一举歼敌近三千人的大捷之后，在二月三日又猛烈袭击右派军队，攻占了敌人的军事总部，解放了整个芒银地区，把敌人打得死伤累累，损失惨重。老挝战友们打得好，打得漂亮！中国人民和全世界革命人民为你们的辉煌胜利而热烈欢呼！
    英雄的老挝爱国军民在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，同仇敌忾，艰苦奋战，发挥了人民战争的无比威力，大量歼灭敌人的有生力量。老挝革命战争的形势越来越好。在去年一年中，老挝爱国军民进行了一千八百多次战斗，歼敌近一万六千名，击落击毁敌机二百八十七架。今年以来，老挝军民发扬不怕疲劳连续作战的精神，乘胜前进，主动出击，不断歼灭敌人，先后收复了被敌人蚕食的南博、会山等战略要地，使老挝人民抗美救国战争打开了一个新的局面。
    老挝人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，是人民战争的伟大胜利。目前在东南亚地区，尤其是在印度支那半岛上，人民战争的烈火正在熊熊燃烧，把美国侵略强盗烧得焦头烂额。越南南方军民全面出击，直捣美伪巢穴，并正继续乘胜追击，扩大战果。泰国人民游击队也在加紧展开新的战斗。老挝爱国军民的新胜利，是对美国侵略者的又一个沉重打击。印度支那半岛各国人民抗击美国侵略者的战斗，相互支援，紧密配合，已经形成了围攻美国侵略强盗的强大的铁拳。美帝国主义这只野兽，正挣扎在这一片人民战争的汪洋大海中，快要灭顶了。
    在越南战场上被英雄的越南人民打得焦头烂额的美国侵略者，仍不甘心它的失败，妄图从扩大军事冒险中寻找出路。美帝国主义侵略魔爪进一步伸进老挝，是它把侵越战争扩大到整个印度支那的一个重要步骤。最近，美国加紧派遣强盗飞机对老挝解放区进行轰炸，不断用直升飞机运送由美国、南越和老挝右派军事人员组成的所谓“别动队”到老挝解放区进行破坏活动，向老挝运进大量武器和军事人员，并在泰老边境的老挝领土修建战略公路。美帝国主义正在所谓“阻止北越向南越渗透”的幌子下，阴谋把侵越战争扩大到老挝。
    但是，美帝国主义的侵略和战争活动，绝对挽救不了它在越南和整个印度支那走向彻底失败的命运，而只能促进印度支那各国人民更广泛地投入反帝斗争的洪流，加速美帝国主义的最后灭亡。越南和老挝人民抗美救国战争的胜利发展和柬埔寨人民反美斗争的展开，就是有力的证明。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所说的：美帝国主义“每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。它已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。”
    老挝人民是经过长期考验的英雄人民，美帝国主义及其走狗的任何军事部署和阴谋活动，都将在老挝人民面前碰得头破血流。苏发努冯亲王最近指出：“老挝人民决不会为任何恫吓所动摇，也决不会向任何压力屈服。美帝国主义是老挝的侵略者。老挝人民必须坚决地把抗击侵略者的斗争进行到底。”这是老挝人民争取民族解放的庄严誓言。
    现在，英雄的老挝人民正在乘胜前进。我们深信，老挝人民一定能够排除一切困难，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计，彻底打败美帝国主义及其走狗，最后取得全民族的解放！
