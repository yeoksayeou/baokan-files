We laboratory assistants have always been looked down upon in school. We had no say in anything. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we too must stand up to expose and criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the bourgeois academic "authorities." We too must become the masters of the educational revolution.

I have worked with a reactionary academic "authority" in our school for nearly twenty years. I believe he is actually a genuine landlord. Why do I say this? The landlord class ruthlessly exploits the peasants, living fat and happy, doing only two things all year round: first, collecting rent, second, managing people. The bourgeois academic "authorities" are the same. They draw high salaries but do nothing for the people. When they come to work, they come and go as they please, and when they do come, they just smoke and drink tea, spreading their poison. This reactionary, disguised as a "specialist" and "professor," harbors deep hatred for the Party and the people. He corrupts the younger generation with his reactionary ideas. How does he guide his graduate students? He first assigns them books to read and then has us laboratory assistants do the experiments. When the results come out, he writes them up into papers, putting his name first, collecting both manuscript fees and review fees. He truly enjoys "fame and fortune."

In reality, these people are the most ignorant and incompetent. Their knowledge comes from us who have practical experience. Once, I discovered a new type of bacterium and asked him about it. He didn't recognize it and blabbered on, saying it was a "mutated Escherichia coli." Nearly a year later, he suddenly brought an article saying someone had discovered a new bacterium and asked me to help him find it. I looked at the article and found it was the same bacterium I had discovered a year earlier. I confronted him. At first, he insisted that the bacterium I discovered was a "mutated Escherichia coli." After I repeated the entire experiment for him to see, this shameless fellow rejoiced, saying, "Ah, it is! Great! Great! It hasn't been published domestically yet. Quick, write a paper." Then he took away all the experimental results. Look, isn't he like a blood-sucking parasite who does nothing but exploit others?

Who put such people on the podium of the medical university and crowned them with the titles of "authorities" and "experts"? It was the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the medical university. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Hold high the great red banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly expose the anti-Party, anti-socialist stand of those so-called 'academic authorities,' and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary ideas in the academic, educational, journalistic, literary, and publishing circles. Seize the leadership in these cultural fields." We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and, together with revolutionary students, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary "academic authorities." The history that has been distorted by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and these reactionary academic "authorities" must be rectified by us!

    批倒资产阶级反动学术“权威”
    中国医科大学实验员　李家红
    我们实验员过去在学校最被人看不起，不管什么事都没有我们的发言权。今天，在毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们也要起来揭发批判党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，也要作教育革命的主人。
    我同学校里的一个反动学术“权威”一道工作近二十年，我认为，他实际上就是一个不折不扣的地主。为什么这么讲呢？地主阶级残酷剥削农民，吃得肥头大耳，一年到头只干两件事：第一收租，第二管人。资产阶级反动学术“权威”也是这样。他拿着高薪，不为人民办好事。工作的时候，爱来就来，爱去就去，来了也是抽烟喝茶，大放其毒。这个披着“专家”、“教授”外衣的反动家伙，对党对人民有刻骨的仇恨。他用他的反动思想腐蚀青年一代。他是怎样带研究生的呢？先给他们布置一些书去读，然后要我们实验员帮他作实验。出了结果，写成论文，他就拿去发表。他的名字自然列在第一位，又拿稿费，又拿审稿费，真是所谓“名利双收”。
    这班家伙实际上是最没有知识的，最无能的。他们的知识，可以说是我们这些有亲身实践经验的人给他们的。有一次，我发现一种新的细菌，去问他，他不认识，还要胡讲一通，说是“大肠杆菌变异”。过了近一年，他突然拿一篇文章来说，有人发现一种细菌，要我帮他找一找。我拿文章一看，原来就是我一年前发现的那种细菌。我就去质问他。起初，他还一口咬定我发现的细菌是“大肠杆菌变异”。我把全部实验重复做给他看了以后，这个不要脸的家伙欣喜若狂地说：“啊，就是它！好！好！国内还没有发表过，快去写论文。”说完就把全部实验结果拿走了。你看，他象不象一个不劳而获专门剥削人的吸血鬼？
    是谁把这样的家伙捧上了医大的讲台，戴上了“权威”“专家”的花冠呢？就是中国赫鲁晓夫及其在医大的代理人。我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，彻底揭露那批反党反社会主义的所谓‘学术权威’的资产阶级反动立场，彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。”我们要按照毛主席的指示办事，和革命的学生一道，彻底批判资产阶级反动“学术权威”。被党内一小撮走资派和这班反动学术“权威”颠倒的历史，要由我们再颠倒过来！
