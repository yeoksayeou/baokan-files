The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, and the situation across the country is excellent. The broad masses of revolutionary people are studying Chairman Mao's works more diligently and actively participating in the great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation within their units. However, a few individuals are not like this; whenever they have free time, they play poker or chess, sometimes until late at night, resulting in lack of energy during work and affecting production and work. When revolutionary masses criticize them, they still say arrogantly, "We want to rebel against the old factory rules; we want to do whatever we want!"

This anarchist thinking was quickly exploited by class enemies. They brought out poker and chess sets, lured some people to play excessively, and incited some masses to disregard labor discipline and not accept correct leadership, saying, "You are a rebel, and no one dares to do anything to you!"

Some comrades think that a few people not observing labor discipline is a minor issue and not worth making a fuss about. In fact, this is not a minor issue but a major issue of the struggle between two lines. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places." We workers must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthen our sense of responsibility as masters of the state, and enhance our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. We must expose and criticize anarchism and voluntarily observe labor discipline.

    搞臭无政府主义
    无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性的胜利，全国形势一片大好。广大革命群众，更加认真地学习毛主席著作，积极参加大批判和本单位的斗批改。但是，少数人不是这样，一有时间就打扑克、下象棋，有时玩到深夜，以致劳动时没精打采，影响了生产和工作。当革命群众提出批评时，他们还“理直气壮”地说：“我们要造旧厂规的反，愿意怎么办就怎么办！” 
    这种无政府主义思想，很快就被阶级敌人利用了。他们拿出扑克和象棋，拉拢一些人去大玩特玩，煽动一些群众不遵守劳动纪律，不接受正确的领导，说什么“你是闯将，谁也不敢把你怎么样！”
    有的同志认为，少数人不遵守劳动纪律，是小问题，用不着大惊小怪。其实，这不是小问题，而是两条道路斗争的大问题。毛主席教导我们：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”。我们工人阶级一定要遵循毛主席的教导，加强国家主人翁的革命责任感，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，搞臭无政府主义，自觉地遵守劳动纪律。
