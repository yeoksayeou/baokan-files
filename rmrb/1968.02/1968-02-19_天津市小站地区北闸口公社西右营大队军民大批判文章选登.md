    Selected Articles from the Military-Civilian Joint Criticism in Xiyouying Production Brigade, Beizhakou People's Commune, Xiaozhan District, Tianjin

    Editor's Note: During China's three years of temporary difficulties, Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, stirred up a black wind of "three freedoms and one contract." This black wind also blew into the Xiaozhan District of Tianjin's suburbs, specifically to the Beizhakou People's Commune's Xiyouying Production Brigade. At that time, the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in this brigade, a class enemy who had infiltrated the Party, actively promoted the "contracting production to households," "expanding private plots," and "self-sufficient profit-and-loss accounting" for sideline businesses, and other revisionist black goods, temporarily making Xiyouying Production Brigade chaotic and disorderly.

    At a critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside, the great socialist education movement began in Xiyouying. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, swept away the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods.

    Since the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xiyouying Production Brigade, who had been tempered through the sharp struggle between the two lines, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fought against the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Recently, together with the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the 4704th Unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in this brigade, they launched a joint military-civilian revolutionary criticism campaign. With Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon, they launched a fierce criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "exploitation is meritorious," and "three freedoms and one contract," determined to thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev in the countryside.

    In the revolutionary criticism campaign, the military and civilians mutually inspired and assisted each other, further promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, deepening the class feelings and combat friendship between the military and civilians, and promoting the in-depth development of the revolutionary criticism campaign.

    天津市小站地区北闸口公社西右营大队军民大批判文章选登
    编者按：在我国三年暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起了一股“三自一包”的黑风。这股黑风也刮到了天津市郊小站地区北闸口公社西右营大队。那个时候，中国赫鲁晓夫在这个大队的代理人、混进党内的阶级异己分子，积极推行“包产到户”、“扩种自留地”和大办“自负盈亏”的副业等修正主义的黑货，一时把西右营大队搞得乌烟瘴气。
    在农村中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的严重时刻，伟大的社会主义教育运动在西右营开始了。贫下中农和革命干部以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，横扫了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动展开以来，这个经受过两条路线尖锐斗争锻炼的西右营大队的贫下中农和革命干部，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线进行坚决的斗争。最近，他们和驻在这个大队的解放军四七○四部队的毛泽东思想宣传队一起，开展军民联合进行的革命大批判。他们以毛主席的最新指示为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”等反动谬论，展开了猛烈的批判，决心彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布在农村的流毒。
    在革命大批判中，军民互相启发，互相帮助，进一步推动了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，更加密切了军民之间的阶级感情和战斗友谊，促进了革命大批判的深入发展。
