The people's war is victorious! The military and civilians of South Vietnam have launched a joint offensive, achieving an unprecedented great situation. After nearly thirty days of brave fighting, they have annihilated over 90,000 enemy troops.

The Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam issued a special bulletin stating that the military and civilians of the South have achieved a victory of great strategic significance, both militarily and politically. The strength of the military and civilians of South Vietnam has never been as powerful as it is today, both on the front lines and in the rear. The Vietnamese people will definitely achieve complete victory, and the enemy will definitely be thoroughly defeated.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 28th, the heroic military and civilians of South Vietnam, since the New Year, have displayed a spirit of bravery, fearlessness, and continuous fighting. They have bravely fought for nearly thirty days and nights, launching a powerful and earth-shaking attack on the enemy, achieving tremendous results, and creating an unprecedented great situation on the battlefield in South Vietnam.

According to the third special bulletin issued by the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, the military and civilians of the South have, in nearly thirty days of fighting since January 29th, killed, wounded, and captured over 90,000 enemy troops, including more than 20,000 American and puppet troops. They have shot down and destroyed more than 1,800 enemy aircraft, destroyed more than 1,300 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and thousands of other military vehicles. They have sunk 90 enemy ships and destroyed hundreds of tons of enemy ammunition and gasoline. They have completely thwarted the enemy's "pacification" plan and liberated 120,000 people. Additionally, in the first few days of February, they have demoralized more than 200,000 puppet troops. The military and civilians of the South have completely disrupted the American aggressors' 1968 strategic plan and troop deployment in South Vietnam, causing the puppet government to collapse, and creating a new situation on the battlefield in the South.

This bulletin, issued on February 26th, stated that since the evening of January 29th, the military and civilians of South Vietnam have launched attacks and uprisings in all major cities and provincial capitals in the South, striking at almost all enemy strongholds from Saigon, Hue, to various provinces, and controlling many areas, causing the American, puppet, and allied troops, as well as the puppet government, to suffer heavy losses. In many places, they have launched repeated attacks and continuously defeated the enemy's counterattacks. In cities and provincial capitals such as Saigon, Hue, Da Nang, Qui Nhon, Da Lat, Phan Rang, Ban Me Thuot, My Tho, and Can Tho, the military and civilians of the South have achieved the most outstanding and brilliant results.

The military and civilians of the South have also launched attacks and uprisings in hundreds of counties and towns, and in all rural areas temporarily controlled by the enemy, and have seized control in almost all these places.

At the same time, the military and civilians of the South have attacked the enemy's command structures at various levels, such as the American military's field commands, the puppet military's army and various military branch commands, the American, puppet, and allied troops' division, regiment, and battalion commands, and the puppet military's various military districts and sub-districts.

They have attacked a series of enemy military bases and lines, completely capturing the Wei Village stronghold, attacking 45 enemy airfields, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses in aircraft, ammunition, gasoline, technical personnel, and pilots. The largest airfields such as Da Nang, Qui Nhon, Pleiku, and Bien Hoa have also been attacked by the military and civilians of the South, and many airfields have been repeatedly attacked. The military and civilians of the South have also attacked a series of enemy warehouses, including the main warehouses and large warehouses supplying various battlefields; attacked a series of enemy ports, naval bases, and enemy warships and boats.

The military and civilians of the South have cut off the enemy's various supply lines, causing many important roads such as the 1st, 4th, 14th, 15th, 19th, and 20th to be paralyzed for long periods; blown up more than 100 bridges; attacked a series of parking lots; destroyed dozens of prisons, rescuing tens of thousands of patriotic compatriots imprisoned by the enemy. The bulletin pointed out that the attacks and uprisings by the military and civilians of the South are still ongoing.

The bulletin said that through these great attacks and uprisings, the military and civilians of South Vietnam have achieved extremely great and comprehensive victories. According to preliminary statistics, the military and civilians of the South have annihilated a large number of enemy troops, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 90,000 enemy troops, including more than 20,000 American and allied troops, equivalent to the number of enemy troops annihilated in three months of 1967. Many enemy units have been annihilated, including three armored regiments, 39 infantry, engineering, combat police, and mechanized transport battalions (mostly infantry battalions), eight armored companies, and 120 companies. The number of enemy battalion-level units annihilated is equivalent to the total number of enemy battalion-level units annihilated in nine months of 1967. The bulletin said that under the powerful blows of the brave attacks and struggles of the military and civilians of South Vietnam, the puppet army has largely collapsed. In just the first few days of February, more than 200,000 puppet troops have been demoralized. Currently, the puppet army is rapidly collapsing and is beyond salvation. Local forces and police have also largely collapsed. In Hue, more than 700 puppet government officials have confessed to the people, 14 strongholds and outposts of the enemy have surrendered, and nearly 1,000 puppet troops have voluntarily taken up arms to fight against the American and puppet troops. By February 10th, in the provinces of Can Tho, My Tho, Binh Dinh, and An Giang, more than 80 enemy strongholds and outposts have surrendered to the revolutionary armed forces. In Tuy Hoa province, 13 strongholds of puppet troops have risen in rebellion. The collapse of the main puppet army forces is also very serious. The 7th Division of the puppet army stationed in the central region has had 950 soldiers desert in just a few days. A battalion of the puppet army stationed in My Tho province has only 30 soldiers left. The bulletin said that the military and civilians of the South have destroyed most of the enemy's war tools. According to statistics, they have shot down and destroyed more than 1,800 enemy aircraft, equivalent to one-third of the total number of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed in 1967; destroyed more than 1,300 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, equivalent to one-third of the total number of armored vehicles destroyed in 1967; also destroyed thousands of other military vehicles, sunk 90 enemy ships, equivalent to two-fifths of the total number of ships sunk in 1967; and destroyed hundreds of tons of enemy ammunition and gasoline. This is a very heavy defeat for the enemy. Their firepower and mobility have been severely weakened. The number of aircraft in the American 1st Airborne Division has been reduced by half. Therefore, the morale of the American, puppet, and allied troops is even lower. The bulletin pointed out that the military and civilians of South Vietnam have struck a thunderous blow against the puppet government institutions, expanding the people's right to self-determination.

The central puppet government institutions of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky traitorous clique have been subjected to fierce attacks and are in a state of paralysis and chaos. Provincial and county-level puppet government institutions are also on the verge of collapse. Their ruling institutions and reactionary grassroots organizations in most villages and towns have basically been swept away. The military and civilians of the South have completely thwarted the enemy's "pacification" plan, liberating 120,000 people. The people of the South have taken control of most rural areas and many towns and are rapidly establishing revolutionary government institutions at various levels. The People's Revolutionary Committee of Thua Thien-Hue has been born, taking on the responsibility of the provincial and municipal people's revolutionary government institutions. The bulletin pointed out that the rear of the military and civilians of the South has expanded, stretching from the mountainous regions of Long Son and the Central Highlands to the vast plains of Quang Tri, Thua Thien, and the central region, and from the mountainous forests of the eastern region to the vast Mekong Delta and the southern region. The manpower and resources of the military and civilians of the South have rapidly increased. While the enemy's rear—the object and territory of plunder—has shrunk to an unprecedented extent.

The bulletin emphasized that the military and civilians of the South have achieved a victory of great strategic significance, both militarily and politically. The American and puppet forces have suffered heavy losses. The strategic goals that the enemy has long pursued, such as "search and destroy" the people's liberation armed forces, "pacify" the countryside, build the puppet government, and strengthen the puppet army, have all suffered heavy defeats. In the future, the enemy will find it even more difficult to achieve these goals.

The bulletin then severely condemned the new crimes committed by the American and puppet forces in their attempt to salvage their failures.

The bulletin said that the brilliant victories of the military and civilians of South Vietnam have opened up a new situation on the battlefield, greatly to our advantage and greatly to the enemy's disadvantage.

The bulletin said that the enemy's strength has never been as weak as it is now. Due to the large number of enemy troops annihilated and demoralized, the American and puppet forces are facing a serious shortage of manpower, an unprecedented problem. In addition to the units that have been annihilated, all American units are understaffed. Many Marine Corps battalions have only half the number of soldiers.

The phenomenon of understaffing in all puppet units is even more serious. At least 30% of the main puppet army battalions have been annihilated and heavily damaged, including eight battalions out of 15 reserve battalions. Currently, the enemy is frantically drafting soldiers. However, this not only fails to strengthen their combat effectiveness but only makes the puppet army more of a motley crew. The United States is sending an additional brigade and regiment to South Vietnam, but how can a few drops of water extinguish a raging fire!

The bulletin confidently said that the strength of the military and civilians of South Vietnam has never been as powerful as it is today, both on the front lines and in the rear, in quantity and quality. Especially, the combat effectiveness of the three armed forces has made a leap forward. The three armed forces are fighting stronger and stronger and are coordinating well. All branches are very brave and clever, closely coordinating, and the level of mutual coordination among the battlefields has reached a new height.

The bulletin said that the enemy's formation has never been as chaotic and deteriorating as it is today. After suffering heavy defeats in the two "dry season strategic counteroffensives" and the "pincer offensive" of 1967, the American aggressors have gradually shifted to the defensive in various battlefields in 1968. The New Year offensive launched by the military and civilians of the South has completely disrupted the enemy's strategic plan and troop deployment, causing their 1968 plan to fail before it could be executed. The enemy's defense system has been breached.

The bulletin said that our victorious momentum, initiative, and offensive momentum have never been as vigorous and powerful as they are today. The battle lines of the military and civilians of the South have surrounded the enemy's so-called safest strongholds. Behind our front lines is a vast rural and mountainous area controlled by the people, which is the source of our inexhaustible strength to defeat the enemy. The bulletin said that the enemy has never been as weak and corrupt politically as it is today. The puppet government is even more shaky and on the verge of collapse. The American aggressors are even more isolated in domestic and international public opinion. The bulletin said that the military and civilians of South Vietnam are closely united, with one heart and one mind, rising up to fight and thoroughly defeat the enemy. Recently, tens of thousands of urban and rural masses have bravely taken to the streets and roads, facing the enemy head-on, forming combat units with captured enemy weapons, and greatly expanding our people's political struggle forces. The people of the South are united with the liberation armed forces like flesh and blood, supporting each other in battle. This power of military-civilian unity makes the enemy very fearful. The prestige of the organizers and inspirers of all victories of the people of the South—the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam—is constantly rising. Workers, peasants, and laborers of all strata are playing a leading role in the attacks and struggles of the entire people.

The National United Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam, the National United Front for Peace and Democracy in Hue, and many other patriotic organizations have been born and are fighting side by side with the entire people.

The people of the North are wholeheartedly supporting and constantly inspiring the military and civilians of the South. We have the most favorable conditions and the most solid foundation. We will definitely achieve complete victory, and the enemy will definitely be thoroughly defeated.

    人民战争胜利万岁！
    南越军民协同作战打出空前大好形势
    英勇奋战近三十天共歼灭敌人九万多
    越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部发表特别公报指出，南方军民取得了军事上政治上具有十分重大的战略意义的胜利。越南南方军民的力量从来没有象今天这样强大，前线和后方都强大。越南人民一定获得全胜，敌人一定彻底失败。
    据新华社河内二十八日电　英雄的越南南方军民新春以来，发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，英勇奋战近三十个昼夜，向敌人发动了震撼山河的猛烈进攻，取得了惊天动地的巨大战果，打出了南越战场空前大好的形势。
    据越南南方解放通讯社公布的越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部第三号特别公报，南方军民在一月二十九日以来的近三十天的战斗中，共打死打伤和俘虏敌军九万多名，其中包括美军和帮凶军两万多名，击落击毁敌机一千八百多架，击毁敌人坦克和装甲车一千三百多辆及其他军用车数千辆，击沉敌人舰艇九十艘，击毁敌人的弹药、汽油上百万吨。彻底挫败了敌人的“绥靖农村”计划，又解放了一百二十万人民。此外，在二月初的几天中，瓦解伪军二十多万人。南方军民全部打乱了美国强盗一九六八年在南越战场的战略计划和兵力部署，打得伪政权陷于瘫痪，打出了南方战场的新局面。
    这项在二月二十六日发表的公报说，从一月二十九日晚上以来的近三十个轰轰烈烈的日日夜夜里，越南南方军民在南方的所有大城市和省会发动了进攻和起义，直捣敌人从西贡、顺化到各个省的几乎所有大小巢穴，控制了许多地方，使美军、伪军和帮凶军以及伪政权遭受了严重损失。在许多地方，反复发动多次进攻，接连打败敌人的多次反扑。在西贡、顺化、岘港、会安、大叻、藩切、邦美蜀、美萩、槟椥和永隆等城市和省会，南方军民战斗最出色和取得了最光辉的战绩。
    南方军民还在成百个县城和小镇发动进攻和起义，在敌人暂时控制的所有农村发动进攻和起义，并且在几乎所有这些地方夺得了控制权。
    与此同时，南方军民进攻了敌军的各级指挥机构，如美军的各个野战司令部，伪军各个军和各个军种、兵种的司令部，美伪军和帮凶军的各个师、旅和团的指挥部，伪军的各个军事小区和军事支区等。
    他们进攻敌人的一系列军事基地和防线，完全攻克卫村据点，进攻敌人的四十五个机场，使敌人在飞机、弹药、汽油、技术人员和驾驶员方面遭到严重的损失。岘港、朱莱、边和、新山一、芙拜等最大的机场也遭到南方军民进攻，许多机场遭到了反复多次的进攻。南方军民还进攻敌人的一系列仓库，其中有供应给各个战场的总仓库和巨型仓库；进攻敌人的一系列港口、海军基地和敌人的战船和战艇。
    南方军民切断了敌人的各条交通线，第一、四、十四、十五、十九、二十号等许多重要公路处于长时间的瘫痪状态；炸毁上百座桥梁；进攻一系列的停车场；捣毁成十座监狱，营救出被敌人囚禁的成万名爱国同胞。公报指出，目前，南方军民的进攻和起义仍在继续进行。
    公报说，越南南方军民通过这些伟大的进攻和起义，取得了极其巨大和全面的胜利。据初步统计，南方军民消灭了敌人大量有生力量，共打死、打伤和俘虏敌人九万多名，其中包括美军和帮凶军两万多名，相当于一九六七年三个月的歼敌数量。敌人许多建制单位被歼灭，其中包括三个装甲团、三十九个步兵营、工兵营、战斗警察营和机械化运输营（步兵营占大多数）、八个装甲支团和一百二十个连。歼灭敌人营级单位的数目，相当于一九六七年九个月歼灭敌人营级单位的总数。公报说，在越南南方军民勇猛进攻和奋起斗争的威力打击下，伪军大量土崩瓦解。仅在一九六八年二月头几天中，被瓦解的伪军就达到二十多万人。目前，伪军正在迅速走向瓦解，无可挽救。地方军和警察也已大部分瓦解。在顺化，有七百多名伪政权人员向人民认罪，十四个据点和哨所的敌人投降，近一千名伪军起义官兵自愿拿起武器，打击美伪军。截至二月十日止，槟椥、美萩、建丰和安江四个省，已经有八十多个据点、哨所中的敌人向革命武装力量投降。茶荣省有十三个据点的伪军士兵起义。伪军主力部队的瓦解也十分严重。驻在南部中区的伪军第七师在几天内就有九百五十名士兵开小差。驻在永隆省的伪军一个营只剩下官兵三十名。公报说，南方军民摧毁了敌人的大部分战争工具。据统计，他们共击落、击毁敌机一千八百多架，相当于一九六七年全年击落、击毁敌机总数的五分之三；击毁敌人坦克、装甲车一千三百多辆，相当于一九六七年全年击毁装甲车总数的三分之一；还击毁其他军车数千辆，击沉敌人船艇九十艘，相当于一九六七年全年击沉船艇总数的五分之二；击毁敌人弹药和汽油上百万吨。这是敌人遭到的极其惨重的失败。它们的火力和机动性遭到了严重的削弱。美国第一空中机动师编制内的飞机只剩下一半。因此，美伪军和帮凶军的士气愈加低落。公报指出，越南南方军民对伪政权机构给予雷霆般的打击，扩大了人民的作主权利。
    阮文绍—阮高其卖国集团的中央伪政权机构遭到了猛烈的进攻，正处于瘫痪和混乱的状态。省级和县级伪政权机构也正摇摇欲坠。它们在大部分乡、村的统治机构和反动基层组织基本上已被扫清。南方军民彻底挫败了敌人的“绥靖农村”计划，解放了一百二十万人民。南方人民取得了大部分农村和许多城镇的控制权，并且正在迅速建立各级革命政权机构。承天—顺化地区人民革命委员会已经诞生，担负起作为省和市的人民革命政权机构的责任。公报指出，南方军民的后方已经扩大，从山峦重叠的长山、西原山区伸延到广治、承天和中部中区的辽阔平原，从南部东区的山林伸延到宽广的同塔梅和湄公河三角洲。南方军民的人力物力迅速加强。而敌人的后方——进行掠夺的对象和地盘，却是空前缩小。
    公报着重指出，南方军民取得了在军事上和政治上都具有十分重大的战略意义的胜利。美伪集团遭到了严重的损失。敌人长期以来所追求的战略目标，如“寻找歼灭”人民解放武装力量、“绥靖”农村、建设伪政权、巩固伪军等，都遭到了惨重失败。今后，敌人将更加难以实现这些目标。
    公报接着严厉谴责了美伪集团为挽救它们的失败所犯下的新罪行。
    公报说，越南南方军民的辉煌胜利打开了战场上的新局面，使之大大有利于我们，而大大不利于敌人。
    公报说，敌人的力量从没有象现在这样衰弱。由于敌人的有生力量被大量歼灭和瓦解，因此美伪军的兵员不足，已经成为前所未有的一个严重问题。除了已经被歼灭的单位以外，美军的所有各个单位都是人数不足的。海军陆战队许多个营只剩下一半的人数。
    伪军的所有单位人数不足的现象更为严重。最少有百分之三十以上的伪军主力营被歼灭和重创，其中包括十五个总后备营中的八个营。目前，敌人正在加紧大肆拉丁。然而，这不仅不能加强战斗力，反而只能使伪军更加成为乌合之众。美国正在增派到越南南方一个旅和一个团的军队，但是它们怎能用几杯水去扑灭一场熊熊大火呢！
    公报满怀信心地说，越南南方军民的力量从来没有象今天这样强大，前线和后方都强大，在数量和质量上都强大。特别是三种武装力量的作战能力有了飞跃的进步。三种武装力量越战越强，并协调地配合。各个兵种都很勇敢和机智，紧密配合，各战场互相配合的水平有了新的提高。
    公报说，敌人的阵势从来没有被打得象今天这样混乱和日益恶化。在两次“旱季战略反攻”和一九六七年的“钳形攻势”遭到惨重失败后，美国强盗一九六八年在各个战场上逐渐转入防御。南方军民发动的新春攻势，完全打乱了敌人的战略计划和兵力部署，使它们一九六八年的计划在还没有执行之前就遭到了破产。敌人的防御系统被突破了。
    公报说，我们的胜利气势、主动气势和进攻气势从没有象今天这样蓬勃高涨，声势浩大。南方军民的战线已把敌人一向吹嘘为最安全的巢穴包围起来了。在我们前线的后面，是一个由人民所控制的广阔农村和山区组成的稳固后方。这是我们用以战胜敌人的无穷无尽的力量的源泉。公报说，敌人在政治上从来没有象今天这样脆弱和腐朽。傀儡政权更加风雨飘摇，朝不保夕。美国侵略者在国内和国际舆论面前更加高度孤立。公报说，越南南方军民正在紧密团结，万众一心，奋起斗争，彻底打败敌人。最近期间，成千上万的城乡群众勇敢地走上街头和公路，同敌人展开面对面斗争，用缴获敌人的武器成立战斗单位，使我们人民的政治斗争队伍空前壮大。南方人民同解放武装力量团结得象亲骨肉一样，在战斗中互相支援。这一军民团结的力量，使敌人十分惧怕。南方人民一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者——越南南方民族解放阵线的威望不断提高。工人、农民、各阶层劳动人民在全体人民的进攻和奋起斗争中，正在发挥自己的突击作用。
    西贡民族民主与和平力量联盟、顺化民族民主与和平力量联盟阵线和其他许多爱国组织已经诞生，正在同全体人民并肩斗争。
    北方骨肉同胞正在全心全力支援和时刻鼓舞南方军民。我们具备了最大的顺利条件和最稳固的基础。我们一定获得全胜，敌人一定彻底失败。
