The news of the victorious establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee has reached Hong Kong, where patriotic compatriots are beating drums and gongs, spreading the word, distributing leaflets, posting slogans, and releasing balloons in a joyous atmosphere. They are cheering thousands of times: "Heartily celebrate the victorious establishment of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees!" "Long live the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, our great leader Chairman Mao, for ten thousand years, for eternity!"

In recent days, workers, students, and patriotic compatriots from various strata in many trade unions, schools, and social organizations have held celebration meetings and various celebration activities with boundless joy.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions and dozens of patriotic trade unions have held various forms of celebration activities. Workers from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber and Plastic Industry General Union and the Kowloon Dockyard Labor Union, who have set a shining example of daring to fight in the anti-British struggle, jumped for joy upon hearing the news. They immediately reported the good news to their patriotic compatriots and held a symposium. They said, this is another great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland! We will, under the inspiration of the victory of the people of our motherland, continue our efforts and persist in the struggle, determined to win the final victory in the anti-British struggle. Students from dozens of patriotic schools sang revolutionary songs, shouted slogans, and enthusiastically cheered the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees. Students from the Boqiao, Xiangdao, Hanhua, and Mong Kok Labor Children's Schools held a parade in their schools, carrying portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations.

The staff of national product companies and patriotic bookstores in Hong Kong and Kowloon, as well as in areas like Tsuen Wan, enthusiastically beat drums and gongs in the marketplaces and in front of the stores to report the good news to the people. Amateur art workers who were performing a revolutionary art show at the Puqing Theater in Kowloon immediately reported the good news to the entire audience upon hearing it and added performances to celebrate this great victory. After the performance, the actors, without even having time to change out of their costumes, held a celebration meeting with the theater staff, shouting over and over again: "Forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Forever loyal to the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!"

At the celebration meetings, Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots from various circles said with boundless enthusiasm that the victorious establishment of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees is a great victory for the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses in firmly carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It declares the thorough failure of the evil plot by the Chinese Khrushchev, the counter-revolutionary two-faced person Tao Zhu, and their agents in Guangdong Province to restore capitalism in Guangdong Province. It once again proves the wise judgment of our great leader Mao: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide is excellent, not just a little good. The overall situation is better than ever before. In a few more months, the situation will be even better." They pointed out that the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees is a heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. They sternly warn the American and Chiang Kai-shek, Soviet revisionists, British, and Japanese spies and reactionary forces of various countries that any attempt to use the Hong Kong and Macau regions to sabotage our great motherland will be thoroughly smashed by the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau.

Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots from various circles unanimously express their high respect to the Chinese People's Liberation Army for carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in Guangdong Province, to the revolutionary masses, and to the revolutionary cadres in Guangdong Province. They excitedly said that the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees has brought us great encouragement and support, making us even more enthusiastic and more confident in victory. We are determined to further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, learn the revolutionary spirit of rebellion from the people of our motherland, and carry the anti-British struggle to the end.

The good news reached Macau, where patriotic compatriots from various circles in Macau also held celebration meetings, enthusiastically cheering: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and cheering the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, the student community, educational community, news community, film community, and business community in Hong Kong, as well as compatriots from various circles in Macau, sent telegrams or letters to the celebration meeting for the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, warmly congratulating the victorious establishment of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees.
