On December 14th of last year, thirteen soldiers of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army bravely repelled fourteen fierce assaults by a company of American troops in the Cat Dong area of the northern part of Ninh Thuan Province, and annihilated the entire company.

The battle began at nine in the morning. As soon as the company of American troops appeared, six Liberation Army soldiers immediately opened fire. The enemy, caught off guard, panicked and threw themselves to the ground. After a long time, they began to shoot at the Liberation Army's trenches. However, the Liberation Army's platoon leader Ah Hai, soldier Ah Hong, and squad leader Ah Li, along with another soldier, had already split into two groups and launched a surprise attack from the enemy's flank and rear, causing the American aggressors, who outnumbered them by twenty or thirty times, to fall into disarray.

When the enemy concentrated their firepower for a second assault, a soldier chose a favorable position, set up a rocket launcher, and fired at the enemy. The enemy's heavy machine gun was immediately destroyed. At this moment, enemy helicopters that had come to reinforce began to strafe the Liberation Army's positions. The soldiers raised their guns and shot down one helicopter. The remaining enemy helicopters, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled in panic.

After the enemy's third and fourth assaults were repelled, they concentrated their forces for a fifth attack and occupied a section of the trench and two fortifications.

In this critical situation, Ah Li, Ah Hong, Ah Hai, and Ah Jun quickly split into two groups and launched an attack. Using tree trunks and mounds for cover, they secretly approached the enemy and, with the support of their comrades, opened fire on the enemy, driving them out of the fortifications.

Then, the enemy brought up a recoilless rifle and two machine guns and launched another attack. The enemy's bullets and shells rained down on the fortifications where Ah Li and Ah Jun were located. The clever Ah Li quickly suppressed the enemy's firepower with a submachine gun, allowing Ah Jun to silence the enemy's recoilless rifle with a rocket launcher. At this time, the enemy in the rear used two heavy machine guns for cover and desperately charged forward. However, these enemy soldiers were shot down one by one. Ah Jun accurately hit the enemy's machine gun crew with a shell. The American devils dared not approach any further and retreated to a safer distance, using mortars and heavy machine guns to fire at the trenches where Ah Hong and Ah Hai were located. Seeing this, Ah Li, enraged, ordered the soldiers to aim the rocket launcher at the enemy's machine gun, which was also silenced. Some American devils were so scared that they cried out. Ah Hong and Ah Hai immediately seized the opportunity, stood up, and fiercely mowed down the enemy with submachine guns. In this way, the soldiers successively repelled the enemy's fourteen assaults. They fought bravely, quickly repaired the fortifications during the lulls, and prepared to counter the enemy's next assault.

By this time, the sun was directly overhead. The remaining American devils gathered all their weapons and ammunition, desperately attempting a final assault on the Liberation Army's positions. Dozens of helicopters also flew in to provide cover fire. However, the terrified remnants of the enemy did not dare to charge forward and only fired wildly for a while before calling for helicopters to evacuate. The Liberation Army soldiers seized the opportunity, jumped out of their fortifications, pursued the enemy, and shot at the enemy helicopters while cleaning up the battlefield. In the end, the thirteen Liberation Army heroes decisively defeated a company of American troops and captured a large amount of booty.

In the great war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation in South Vietnam, countless heroes have emerged. This is a young hero scout who, risking his life, fought bravely and intelligently to annihilate the evil American aggressors.

    十三勇士痛歼美国少爷兵
    去年十二月十四日，十三名南越解放军战士在西宁省北部的卡东地区，英勇地打退美军一个连的十四次疯狂进攻，并且歼灭了这个连。
    战斗是在上午九点钟开始的。当这一连美军刚出现，解放军六名战士立即开火，敌人遭到突然袭击，吓得惊惶失措，纷纷卧倒在地，过了好久才向解放军的战壕射击。但是解放军班长阿海、战士阿鸿和排长阿利以及另一个战士，早已分成两路，从敌人的侧面和背后出击，打得数量比自己多二、三十倍的美国侵略军慌作一团。
    当敌人再次集中火力向解放军的第一线疯狂射击，并且进行第二次进攻时，一个战士选择了一个有利地形，架上火箭筒，向敌人打去，敌人的一挺重机枪马上被打得粉碎。这时，赶来增援的敌人直升飞机，向解放军阵地疯狂扫射。战士们又举起枪，打落一架，其余的敌机，见势不妙，都慌张逃走。
    敌人的第三、第四次进攻接连被击溃后，又集中力量进行第五次反扑，并且占领了一段战壕和两个工事。
    在这紧急的情况下，阿利、阿鸿、阿海和阿俊四人迅速地分成两路出击。他们借助树干和土堆，秘密地接近敌人，在战友们的配合下，再次向敌人猛烈开火，把敌人打出了工事。
    接着，敌人拖来了一门无后座力炮和两挺机枪，又发起了进攻。敌人的子弹和炮弹密集地向阿利和阿俊所在的工事打来。机智的阿利赶快用冲锋枪压制住敌人的火力，让阿俊用火箭筒把敌人的无后座力炮打哑了。这时，后面的敌人用两挺重机枪作掩护，拚命地冲上来。但是，这些敌人被打得一个接着一个倒下了。阿俊以准确的炮弹又消灭了敌人的一个机枪组。美国鬼子再也不敢接近了，只好退到较远的地方用迫击炮和重机枪向阿鸿和阿海所在的战壕射击。阿利看见这种情况，怒火冲天，便叫战士用火箭筒瞄准敌人的机枪打，这挺重机枪又被打哑了，一些美国鬼子被吓得嚎哭起来。阿鸿和阿海马上抓紧时机，站起来用冲锋枪猛烈地扫射敌人。就这样战士们接连击退了敌人的十四次进攻。他们越打越勇，抓紧空隙迅速地修筑工事，把弹药集中起来，准备迎击敌人的下一次反扑。
    这时，太阳已经挂在正空。残存的美国鬼子把各种武器和弹药集中起来，妄图向解放军阵地绝望地发起最后一次反扑。成十架直升飞机也飞来配合扫射。但是，被打得心惊肉跳的残敌最后并不敢冲上来，只是胡乱地打了一阵枪，便呼唤直升飞机救驾。解放军战士乘机从工事里跳出来，追击敌人，边打敌机边收拾战场。结果，十三名解放军勇士，痛歼一连美国少爷兵，缴获大批战利品。
