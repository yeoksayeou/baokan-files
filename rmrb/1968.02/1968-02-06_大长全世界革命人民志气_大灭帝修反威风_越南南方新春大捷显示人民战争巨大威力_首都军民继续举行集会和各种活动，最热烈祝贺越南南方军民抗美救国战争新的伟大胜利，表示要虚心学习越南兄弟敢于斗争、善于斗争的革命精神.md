The great victory of the people of South Vietnam in the spring offensive of their anti-American national salvation war has demonstrated the tremendous power of people's war. The military and civilian population of the capital continue to hold rallies and various activities, expressing their warmest congratulations on the new great victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population in their anti-American national salvation war, and expressing their willingness to humbly learn from the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and being good at struggle from their Vietnamese brothers.

	New China News Agency, February 5th: The military and civilian population of the capital held rallies and various activities today, enthusiastically hailing the great victory of the people of South Vietnam in their anti-American national salvation war, and congratulating the South Vietnamese military and civilian population on their spring offensive victory.

	Today, the military and civilian population of the capital, with hearts full of joy, posted many large-character slogans in every street and alley, enthusiastically hailing the spring offensive victory of the people of South Vietnam. Beijing Steel Plant, Beijing Second Seven Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, Beijing East Red Automobile Manufacturing Factory Second Auxiliary Factory, Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Factory, Beijing Second Cotton Textile Factory, Beijing University, Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine College, and many other units held meetings today to celebrate the spring offensive victory of the Vietnamese people. Revolutionary workers and students at the meetings repeatedly shouted: "Salute to the heroic people of South Vietnam!" "Heartily congratulate the people of South Vietnam on their spring offensive victory!" "Vietnam will win! The U.S. imperialists will be defeated!" Some Vietnamese students and trainees also participated in the meetings, celebrating the victory together with the people of the capital.

	The support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the Beijing Dyeing Factory, the responsible comrades of the Beijing Dyeing Factory Revolutionary Committee, and the revolutionary worker representatives from various workshops and departments enthusiastically praised the glorious victory of the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilian population in their all-out attack on the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. They said, this victory has greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary people worldwide and crushed the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. They expressed that the Chinese working class learns from you and pays the highest revolutionary respect to you! They pointed out that the spring offensive victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population has disrupted the U.S. imperialists' war plans in Vietnam, more broadly mobilizing the people of cities and countryside in Vietnam to join the great anti-American national salvation war. The powerful offensive of the heroic people of South Vietnam this time has the characteristics of combining military and civilian forces, cities and countryside, and internal and external forces, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle, daring to win, not fearing sacrifice, and advancing bravely, developing people's war to a high level.

	The proletarian revolutionary factions of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau and Vietnamese trainees from the anti-American front celebrated the spring offensive victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population together today. The representative of the support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the Construction Engineering Bureau and the worker representative said in their speeches that the Vietnamese people, under extremely difficult conditions, have beaten the most ferocious enemy of the world's revolutionary people, the U.S. imperialists, into a state of panic and desperation, setting a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations to liberate themselves. The peoples of China and Vietnam are true close comrades. Brotherly Vietnamese people can be assured that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people. We will always fight alongside the Vietnamese people and achieve victory together. The Vietnamese trainee representative Chen You'ai also spoke at the meeting. He said, we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, and with the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the peoples of brotherly countries, the Vietnamese people will surely win, and U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated!

	Some troops of the Beijing Garrison, guarding by the side of the great leader Chairman Mao, held meetings to enthusiastically hail the great victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population. They expressed their determination to learn from their Vietnamese brothers, to learn their revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and being good at struggle. Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." The soldiers pointed out that the glorious victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian population has once again demonstrated the tremendous power of people's war. The soldiers of a certain regiment, who had won honors in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, pointed out at the celebration meeting that the U.S. imperialists, this paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, had been defeated by the Chinese and Korean peoples. Today, it has launched an aggression against Vietnam, and it can be predicted that its outcome will not be any better. The seven hundred million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will surely be the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people to carry the anti-American national salvation war through to the end.

	The revolutionary students and teachers of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Beijing Normal University said at the celebration meeting that the great victory of the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilian population has proven the tremendous power of people's war, indicating that the days of U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam are numbered. The heroic Vietnamese people, insisting on a protracted war, will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, achieving the final victory.

    新华社五日讯　首都军民今天继续举行集会和各种活动，最热烈地欢呼越南南方人民在抗美救国战争中取得的伟大胜利，祝贺越南南方军民新春大捷。
    今天，首都军民怀着无限喜悦的心情，在全城大街小巷贴出了许多热烈欢呼越南南方人民新春大捷的大字标语。北京钢厂，北京二七机车车辆厂，北京东方红汽车制造厂第二附件厂，北京内燃机总厂，北京第二棉纺织厂，北京大学，北京中医学院等许多单位，今天都举行了欢呼越南人民新春大捷大会。广大革命职工和革命师生在会上不断高呼：“向英雄的越南南方人民致敬！”“热烈祝贺越南南方人民新春大捷！”“越南必胜！美帝必败！”一些越南留学生、实习生也参加了大会，同首都人民一起庆祝胜利。
    中国人民解放军驻北京印染厂支左人员、北京印染厂革命委员会负责人以及各车间科室的革命职工代表在祝捷大会上热情赞扬英雄的越南南方军民在全面袭击美国侵略者及其走狗的战斗中取得的辉煌胜利。他们说，这一胜利大长了全世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。他们表示，我们中国工人阶级向你们学习，向你们致以最崇高的革命敬礼！他们指出，越南南方军民的新春大捷，打乱了美帝侵越战争的部署，更广泛地动员了越南城乡各界人民投入伟大的抗美救国战争。英雄的越南南方人民这次强大的出击，具有军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合的特点，发扬了敢于斗争，敢于胜利，不怕牺牲，前赴后继的革命精神，把人民战争发展到一个高度水平。
    北京市建筑工程局的无产阶级革命派和来自反美前线的越南实习生今天共同庆祝越南南方军民新春大捷。人民解放军驻建工局支左人员代表和工人代表在发言中说，越南人民在非常艰苦的条件下，把世界革命人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义打得丧魂落魄，走投无路，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放斗争树立了光辉的榜样。中越两国人民是真正的亲密的战友。兄弟的越南人民可以相信，用毛泽东思想武装起来的全中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，我们永远同越南人民战斗在一起，胜利在一起。越南实习生代表陈友爱也在会上讲了话。他说，我们坚信，在越南劳动党和胡主席的领导下，并得到中国人民和各兄弟国家人民的同情和支持，我们越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败！
    守卫在伟大领袖毛主席身边的北京卫戍区一些部队指战员，分别举行集会，热烈欢呼南越军民取得的伟大胜利。他们表示要向越南兄弟学习。学习他们敢于斗争、善于斗争的革命精神。毛主席教导我们说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”指战员们指出，南越军民的辉煌胜利，又一次显示了人民战争的巨大威力。在抗美援朝战争中荣立过战功的某部七连指战员，在庆祝大会上指出，美帝国主义这只外强中干的纸老虎，曾被中朝人民打得一败涂地。今天，它又发动了侵越战争，可以断定，其结果也决不会有好下场。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    北京航空学院和北京师范大学革命师生在祝捷大会上说，英雄的越南南方军民取得的伟大胜利，证明人民战争的强大威力，说明美帝国主义在南越的日子不长了。英雄的越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够打败美国侵略者及其走狗，取得最后的胜利。
