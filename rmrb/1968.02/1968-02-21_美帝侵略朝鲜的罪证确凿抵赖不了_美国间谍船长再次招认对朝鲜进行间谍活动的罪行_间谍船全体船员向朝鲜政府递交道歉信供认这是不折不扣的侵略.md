The U.S. imperialists' invasion of Korea: Irrefutable evidence and admissions

The captain of the U.S. spy ship, Lloyd M. Bucher, has again confessed to his espionage activities against Korea. The entire crew of the spy ship has submitted an apology letter to the Korean government, admitting that this was an outright act of invasion.

New China News Agency, February 20th – The Central News Agency of Korea recently published the second confession of Lloyd M. Bucher, the captain of the U.S. armed spy ship "Pueblo," which was captured by the Korean People's Navy on January 23rd. In his confession, Bucher admitted to some details of the criminal activities conducted by this armed spy ship before and after it intruded into Korean territorial waters. He admitted that the "Pueblo" was commissioned in May 1967 in Bremerton, Washington State, along with another U.S. spy ship, the "Palm Beach." On November 6th, it sailed to Pearl Harbor and arrived in Yokosuka on December 1st. There, the Commander of the U.S. Fleet in Japan, Frank Johnson, gave them the specific task of "monitoring the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

Bucher confessed: "My mission was to investigate electronic wave conditions, with a focus on identifying the operational commands of the Korean People's Navy and the activities of the navy in the four regions of Chongjin, Songjin, Mayangdo, and Wonsan, and to determine the radar positions along the coast of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." Bucher also admitted that another U.S. spy ship, the "Flagship," had been active in the Pacific since July 1966.

He confessed: "I also received specific intelligence collection requirements for gathering information about the navy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

"This requirement also specified that we collect information about the ship numbers, classes, identification flag numbers, deployment, capabilities, missions, organization, command systems, and the locations of the main naval command centers. The requirement also specified the collection of detailed information about naval bases, naval patrol vessels, and naval exercises."

"We were to conduct oceanic surveys and other oceanic measurements as needed for submarine activities. We were to record all radar signals for later analysis by specialists in this field."

"We were to record all major events that occurred during the operation. We were to record our positions as often as possible and avoid detection. If our ship was interfered with, I was to send a telegram to the Commander of the U.S. Fleet in Japan."

"We were also to keep all intelligence and undeveloped film on the ship and hand them over upon our return to Yokosuka."

After detailing the espionage activities conducted by this armed spy ship after it intruded into Korean territorial waters, Bucher admitted: "The fact that the 'Pueblo' deeply invaded the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is clearly recorded in the ship's position logs and navigation plans kept by Murphy, the executive officer and navigator. They personally determined the ship's direction each time and recorded its position."

"I received telegrams every day from the command center in Japan, which were crucial in guiding our operations throughout the entire activity."

"During this operation, we intercepted signals from approximately 130 radars of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

"We kept all highly confidential intelligence information on the ship for reporting after the voyage."

Bucher finally had to admit: "Collecting intelligence in the territorial waters or airspace of another country is espionage, a gross violation of their sovereignty. I consider this a despicable crime that must be stopped. The espionage activities I conducted were acts of hostile aggression against the Korean people."

New China News Agency, February 20th – According to the Central News Agency of Korea, the entire crew of the U.S. armed spy ship "Pueblo," which illegally intruded into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and was captured by the Korean People's Navy, recently submitted a joint apology letter to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They admitted that the "Pueblo's" intrusion into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was a "premeditated espionage operation," and that "the responsibility for plotting this crime lies with the U.S. government authorities and military leaders. Sending the 'Pueblo' to intrude into Korean waters is an outright act of aggression."

This joint apology letter was signed by all 82 members of the crew of the U.S. armed spy ship "Pueblo," including Captain Lloyd M. Bucher.

The apology letter stated: "We openly intruded into the territorial waters of a sovereign state, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and conducted serious hostile actions. We have committed a crime and deserve whatever punishment the Korean people deem necessary. Because we are not only prisoners of war but also criminals caught in the act of espionage."

"Because we know our actions better than anyone else, we on the 'Pueblo' are the most reliable witnesses to these crimes, and therefore, we must honestly admit our serious crimes."

The apology letter stated: "We must clarify that this intrusion was not due to any technical oversight on our part but was a premeditated espionage operation."

"On December 2, 1967, we received our mission from U.S. Fleet Commander in Japan, Rear Admiral Frank Johnson, to conduct military espionage in the coastal waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

"To carry out this order, we set sail from Sasebo, Japan, under the cover of an oceanic electronic research ship, and conducted espionage activities in the coastal waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea via the Soviet coast."

"Although the nature of our crimes is serious, our responsibility is still less than that of our government. Those who should ultimately be held responsible for espionage against another country are their organizers."

The apology letter stated: "We once again publicly admit to the world that we intruded into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and conducted espionage activities. Our espionage and intrusion were acts of aggression."

    美帝侵略朝鲜的罪证确凿抵赖不了
    美国间谍船长再次招认对朝鲜进行间谍活动的罪行
    间谍船全体船员向朝鲜政府递交道歉信供认这是不折不扣的侵略
    新华社二十日讯　朝鲜中央通讯社最近公布了被朝鲜人民军海军在一月二十三日俘获的美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”船长劳埃德·马克·布克的第二次供词。布克在供词中招认了这艘武装间谍船侵入朝鲜领海前后所进行的罪恶活动的一些细节。他供认，“普韦布洛号”于一九六七年五月份在美国华盛顿州布雷默顿和美国另一艘间谍船“棕榈海滩号”一起被编入现役。十一月六日开往珍珠港，十二月一日到达横须贺。在那里，驻日本海军司令弗兰克·约翰逊给他们“布置了监视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的具体任务。”
    布克供认：“我的任务是查清电子波情况，而重点放在查清朝鲜人民军的海军作战命令，以及在清津、城津、马养岛和元山这四个区域海军活动的情况，测定朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海的雷达阵地。”布克还供认，美国另一艘间谍船“旗帜号”“从一九六六年七月就不断地活动于太平洋水域。”
    他供认：“我还收到为搜集关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国海军情报的‘情报搜集具体要求’。”
    “这个要求还规定我们收集关于军舰的号码、舰级、识别旗号码、部署、能力、任务、组织和指挥系统以及主要的海军指挥部的所在地的情报。要求还规定搜集关于海军基地、海军巡逻舰只和海军演习的详细情报。”
    “要我们一有可能就进行为潜水艇活动服务的海洋探测和其他海洋测量。要我们把所有雷达信号都记录下来，以便以后让这方面的专业人员去分析。”
    “要我把行动期间所发生的一切重大事情都记录下来。要我们尽可能经常记录我们的方位，尽可能不被发觉。如果我们的船受到干扰，我就打电报给驻日本海军司令。”
    “还要我们在船上把所有情报和未冲洗的胶卷都保管起来，在我们回横须贺时把这些东西交上去。”
    布克在详细地招认了这艘武装间谍船侵入朝鲜领海后所进行的间谍活动后供认：“‘普韦布洛号’深入侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海的事实，确切地记在墨菲上尉的助手执行军官和导航员所保存的船位记载表和航海计划上，他们每次亲自确定船的方向，并把它当时的方位记载下来。”
    “我每天从在日本的指挥部收到电报，这些电报在整个活动期间具有指导行动的重要性。”
    “在这次活动期间，我们截听了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的约一百三十座雷达的信号。”
    “我们把所有极为机密的间谍情报保存在船上的档案中以便在航行之后向他们报告。”
    布克最后不得不承认：“在其他国家的领海或领空内收集情报是间谍行动，是粗暴地破坏它们的主权。我认为，这是一个可卑的罪行，必须制止。”“我所进行的这次间谍活动是对朝鲜人民的敌意的侵略行动。”
    新华社二十日讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，非法侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海后被朝鲜人民军海军俘获的美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”全体人员，最近联名向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府递交道歉信供认，“普韦布洛号”侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领海是“预先安排好的预谋的间谍行动”，“策划这一罪行的责任，必须由美国政府当局和军事领导人承担。派遣‘普韦布洛号’侵入朝鲜水域，这是不折不扣的侵略罪行。”
    这封联名道歉信是由美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”全体八十二名人员包括船长劳埃德·马克·布克签名的。
    道歉信说：“我们公开地侵入一个主权国家，即朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领海，进行严重的敌对行动，我们犯下了罪，我们应当受到朝鲜人民不管有多严重的惩罚。因为我们不仅仅是战俘，而且是在进行间谍活动时被抓住的罪犯。”
    “因为我们对自己的行动知道得比任何人都清楚，所以我们‘普韦布洛号’上的人是可以提供关于这些罪行的最确凿的证据的证人，因此，我们必须老老实实承认自己的严重罪行。”
    道歉信说：“我们必须说明，这种入侵不是由于我们在技术上的任何疏忽错误而造成的，而是预先安排好的预谋的间谍行动。”
    “在一九六七年十二月二日，我们在横须贺接受了美国驻日本海军司令弗兰克·约翰逊海军少将给我们的任务，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海水域进行军事间谍活动。”
    “为了执行这个命令，我们在海洋电子研究船的掩护下从日本的佐世保起航，取道苏联沿海，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海水域进行间谍活动。”
    “尽管我们所犯的罪行的性质是严重的，但是，我们的责任仍然比我国政府的责任要小。应当最后为对另一国家从事间谍罪行负责的人乃是他们的组织者。”
    道歉信说：“我们再次向世界公开承认，我们侵入了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领海，并进行了间谍活动。我们的间谍和侵入行为是侵略性的。”
