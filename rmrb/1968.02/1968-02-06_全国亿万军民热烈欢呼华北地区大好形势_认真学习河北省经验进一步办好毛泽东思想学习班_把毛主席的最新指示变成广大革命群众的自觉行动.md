The mountains and rivers of North China are all red! Joyous news has come from the vicinity of the capital of our great motherland: the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province has been born in triumph. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country are enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, shouting joyously a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

In their congratulatory editorial on the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily conveyed the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Setting up study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." As the military and civilians across the country rejoice in the red mountains and rivers of North China, they have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and unanimously expressed their determination to deeply understand Chairman Mao's great teachings, learn from the good experiences of Hebei Province, firmly grasp the key of holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and ensure that all of Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented and fully implemented, turning them into conscious revolutionary actions. This will drive the current excellent revolutionary situation to leap forward and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Revolutionary Committees or Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Groups of Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Shandong, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Gansu, Jiangxi, Henan, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have all sent telegrams to the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, warmly hailing the red mountains and rivers of North China and warmly congratulating the glorious birth of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They also expressed their willingness to humbly learn from the fighting experiences of the revolutionary people of Hebei. These telegrams pointed out that the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee once again proves the wise judgment of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before." "In a few more months, the overall situation will be even better." The establishment of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee will undoubtedly have a great promoting effect on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country.

The standing committee expansion meeting of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee held on the afternoon of the 5th seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on setting up study classes and the experiences of Hebei Province. Comrades unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's teachings on setting up study classes have great strategic significance for seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The entire region of Inner Mongolia has already set up 30,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over a hundred million people participating in the study. However, this is not enough; we must continue to set up and improve these classes, solving various problems in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in a targeted manner. Comrades participating in the standing committee meeting of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, expressed their determination to learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions of Hebei, to set up and improve Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and to lead the 50 million revolutionary people of Henan to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Since last October, over 10,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been set up in urban and rural areas across Qinghai Province. Many regions have made new creations and developments in their study classes, adding content such as class education, situation education, and labor education, and some have moved the classes to the grassroots level. After hearing the joyous news of the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses across the province excitedly said that they must learn from the experiences of Hebei, prioritize the extensive and thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and place this at the forefront of all work. The leading members of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the responsible persons of the Jiangxi "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" all expressed that the proletarian revolutionary factions of Hebei and the broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hebei have created valuable experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must learn from these experiences, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, seriously engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes that are more numerous, better, and more solid. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on setting up study classes and the experiences of Hebei, the members of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee immediately decided to hold a standing committee meeting on the 6th to discuss how to further improve Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The joyous news reached Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province. The brigade leader, Jia Chengzhe, said that the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Dazhai must learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions of Hebei, take "self-criticism and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, further improve Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, and raise the ideological revolutionization of all brigade members to a new level. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions of Changsha's Qingshuitang, who have created good experiences in setting up study classes, as well as the revolutionary workers of Changsha Automobile Electrical Equipment Factory, who have achieved revolutionary unity and established a revolutionary committee through setting up study classes, all expressed that in the future, they will continue to improve the study classes, making them better and better, so that Chairman Mao's latest instructions can be grasped by the broad revolutionary masses and turned into conscious actions of the masses.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai, Gansu, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Jilin, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, and Anhui, after learning from the revolutionary experiences of Hebei, expressed their determination to emphasize the "public" aspect, grasp the "use" aspect, carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, seriously engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, thoroughly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and further strengthen proletarian party spirit. Recently, the revolutionary youngsters of Fudan University in Shanghai overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism through setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, achieved revolutionary tripartite alliance, and established a school revolutionary committee. They are determined to continue to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further consolidate revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "tripartite alliance." Today, Lanzhou University in Gansu Province held a full-school revolutionary teachers and students meeting, expressing their determination to learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions of Hebei, deeply study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overthrow factionalism, enhance party spirit, and welcome the birth of the school revolutionary committee. The workers and families of the Wuhui Railway Division fighting on the railway line in the Hexi Corridor held a meeting to celebrate the birth of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They unanimously expressed their determination to firmly overthrow factionalism, enhance party spirit, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the railway system to the end. The two revolutionary mass organizations of the Xinjiang Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Printing Factory jointly held a symposium to celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hebei Province and seriously learn from the valuable experiences created by the revolutionary people of Hebei. They expressed their determination to learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions of Hebei, firmly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and contribute to promoting revolutionary unity.

The joyous news spread, and the broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army were elated. Many units held symposiums and celebration meetings today and expressed their determination to seriously learn from the fighting experiences of the revolutionary people of Hebei, the Hebei Provincial Military Region, and the broad soldiers and officers stationed there. The soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison and the Inner Mongolia garrison, as well as the broad soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" in Zhejiang Province, all expressed their determination to humbly learn from the experiences of Hebei, further help the revolutionary masses set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making new contributions to seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Shanxi garrison, where the late "Model of Love for the People" Xie Sheng served, pointed out that the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee once again fully proves that the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must better implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with the revolutionary masses. The entire "Model Support-Left and Love-the-People Platoon" expressed after hearing the joyous news that they would learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions and the garrison troops of Hebei with actual actions, unconditionally execute the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions," study, use, and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions well, and make new contributions to seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
