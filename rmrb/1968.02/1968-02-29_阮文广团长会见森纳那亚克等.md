Nguyen Van Hoang, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam permanently stationed in China, met with Sena-nayake, secretary-general of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, and representatives from various member countries on February 26. He expressed gratitude to the peoples and writers of Asia and Africa for their strong support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression.

He said, the people of South Vietnam have demonstrated the boundless might of people's war. During the recent Lunar New Year, they launched a full-scale offensive from the countryside to the cities, making the American imperialists suffer a humiliating defeat. The New Year's victories have created extremely favorable conditions for the final victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. He stated that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will further mobilize the masses, press on with the victories, and carry the war of resistance against American aggression to the end, determined not to rest until complete victory is achieved.

Senanayake and other representatives, in their speeches, extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Afro-Asian writers to the heroic people of South Vietnam for their New Year's victories. They pointed out that the victories of the Vietnamese people have greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary peoples of the world and have dealt a heavy blow to the prestige of imperialism. They have once again proven two truths: that American imperialism is indeed a paper tiger; and that regardless of the size of a country, as long as the masses are mobilized and people's war is waged, even the strongest enemy can be defeated. Finally, they once again expressed that the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and the Afro-Asian writers will continue to firmly support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, and will forever stand together with, fight together with, and win together with the brotherly Vietnamese people.

    阮文广团长会见森纳那亚克等
    新华社二十八日讯  越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广二十六日在这里会见亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和各成员国代表时，对亚非各国人民和作家对越南人民抗美救国战争的大力支持表示感谢。他说，越南南方人民发挥了人民战争的无穷威力，新春期间，从乡村到城市全面出击，打得美帝国主义狼狈不堪。新春大捷为越南人民抗美救国斗争的最后胜利，创造了极为有利的条件。他表示，越南南方民族解放阵线将进一步发动群众，乘胜前进，把抗美救国战争进行到底，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    森纳那亚克和其他成员国代表在发言中，代表亚非作家对英雄的越南南方人民的新春大捷表示热烈祝贺。他们指出，越南人民的胜利，大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义的威风，再一次证明了两个真理：美帝国主义的确是一只纸老虎；国家不分大小，只要发动群众，坚持人民战争，再强大的敌人，都是可以打败的。最后，他们再一次表示：亚非作家常设局和亚非作家，将继续坚定不移地支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，将永远和兄弟的越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
