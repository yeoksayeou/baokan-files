The Lanzhou Military Region's Proletarian Revolutionary Support Office organized a cadre study class, where through class education and self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, cadres' self-revolutionary consciousness was greatly enhanced. They acted according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, correctly handled relations with the masses, and correctly handled relations with themselves. They bravely stood out to make revolution, effectively promoting and advancing the revolutionary three-in-one combination and revolutionary great alliance in various units.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling relations with cadres is a key issue in implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This issue must be resolved." The Lanzhou Military Region's Proletarian Revolutionary Support Office, following this great teaching, assisted the proletarian revolutionary factions in organizing a study class of Mao Zedong Thought for local leading cadres. It organized leading cadres from the provincial and municipal party committees, various colleges and universities, and military-controlled factories and enterprises to participate in the study. Many of these cadres made various mistakes during the Cultural Revolution, with some implementing the bourgeois reactionary line and others taking the wrong side. The study class carried forward the spirit of the Yan'an Rectification Movement, using the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to warmly help them study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and actively help them summarize experiences and lessons, carry forward achievements, correct mistakes, and better understand and grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They encouraged them to put down their burdens and stride forward with the situation, joining the ranks of the proletarian revolution. From last October to now, three sessions have been held. The various levels of leading cadres who participated in the study have undergone a complete change in their spiritual outlook through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. During the study process, they used their self-criticism experiences as self-examinations to the revolutionary factions of their units and, with the attitude of a primary school student, frequently returned to their units to seek the opinions of the masses and strive for the help of the revolutionary masses. As a result, they gained the understanding and trust of the revolutionary masses. Many revolutionary leading cadres participated in the three-in-one combination leadership corps when the revolutionary committees were established in their units.

The leadership of the study class, following Chairman Mao's instructions on the majority of cadres being good and uniting with the majority of cadres, seriously analyzed and studied the situation of the cadres, believed in the majority of the cadres, united with the majority of cadres, believed in the self-reform consciousness of the cadres, and affirmed that these cadres were loyal to Chairman Mao and wanted to make revolution with Chairman Mao. Starting from this fundamental viewpoint, the study class took "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism" as the guideline, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles" as ideological weapons, to help cadres focus on the class education of the "Four Remembrances and Four Investigations." That is:

(1) Remember Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and methods of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and investigate one's own thoughts, stance, and attitude during the Cultural Revolution;

(2) Remember Chairman Mao's series of great instructions on cadre issues since the Cultural Revolution, and investigate the errors one made during the Cultural Revolution and their roots and harms;

(3) Remember class hatred, national hatred, and the bloodshed and sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs, and investigate the tendency to forget class struggle and forget to carry the revolution through to the end in a peaceful environment;

(4) Remember Chairman Mao's cultivation and education of cadres, and investigate one's thoughts of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

In the process of remembrance and comparison, many revolutionary leading cadres made profound self-examinations, greatly arousing their proletarian class consciousness, and sparking a revolution in their souls. Some comrades initially thought that after revolutionizing for decades, how could one say there are problems with one's class stance? Through remembrance and investigation, recalling past hard struggles and investigating today's waning revolutionary will, they indeed forgot the past hardships. They deeply felt that today's fear of the masses was because there was a "self" in their minds, forgetting class struggle, and not revolutionizing oneself would inevitably oppose the masses' revolution. Some cadres deeply examined their errors of arrogance after national liberation and peaceful evolution, angrily denouncing the harm of the revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Through the remembrance and investigation education, everyone realized that in the face of class struggle, not eliminating the "self" would not bring about the "dare." To defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one must defeat the "self" in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, bravely stand out to make revolution, and achieve new merits in the Cultural Revolution.

Practice has proven that the "Four Remembrances and Four Investigations" class education is a good method to arouse the self-consciousness of leading cadres and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. As a result, cadres further understood the great significance of the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, further understood Chairman Mao's great teachings on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and gained boundless strength for self-conscious self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Self-criticism and criticism of revisionism were universally carried out on the basis of high self-consciousness.

During the self-criticism process, the study class guided and helped cadres focus on correctly handling relations with the masses and correctly handling relations with themselves, checking their own errors against Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Many people said during their self-criticism that before coming to the study class, they had studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues many times, but because of the "self," they could not truly understand and implement them. On the contrary, they blamed the masses for being too strict with them. Everyone realized that studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with a "self" could only pick and choose, which was the greatest "self" and the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Some originally thought that it was the masses who did not liberate themselves and did not allow themselves to stand out. After self-criticism, their understanding improved, and they said that having the "fear" would not dare to stand out, and not defeating the "self" would not be liberated from the "self." Whether cadres can stand out depends on whether cadres can act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, correctly handle relations with the masses, correctly handle relations with themselves, and bravely stand out to make revolution.

Through remembrance, investigation, and self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, these leading cadres enhanced their class consciousness, loved the great leader Chairman Mao even more, and worshipped the great Mao Zedong Thought even more. Many comrades, when examining the reasons for their mistakes, said that the fundamental reason was not listening to Chairman Mao's words at all times, in all things, and in all places, and not acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. After returning to their units, they insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Some even organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes with mass organizations, taking the lead in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. A propaganda department deputy director of a unit previously feared that exposing the party committee's issues would implicate himself. After studying, he not only actively exposed issues but also actively did cadre work, mobilizing cadres to boldly expose issues, promoting the deep development of revolutionary criticism and struggle in this unit. A responsible cadre of a certain design institute, whose unit's faction wanted to criticize him. After studying, he first went to this faction to make a self-examination, listened to the masses' criticisms, and because the self-examination was profound and truly touched the soul, the masses were very satisfied. Then, he actively did work for the two factions of the masses, promoting the revolutionary great alliance of the two factions, making the revolution and production of this institute both flourish.

    在兰州部队协助革命派举办的学习班中认真斗私批修
    兰州广大革命干部自觉站出来革命
    他们坚决按照毛主席最新指示办事，正确对待群众，正确对待自己
    新华社兰州六日电　人民解放军兰州部队支左办公室举办干部学习班，通过阶级教育和斗私批修，干部自我革命的自觉性大大提高，他们按毛主席最新指示办事，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，勇敢地站出来革命，有力地推动和促进了各单位的革命大联合和革命三结合。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”兰州部队支左办公室遵循这一伟大教导，协助无产阶级革命派办起了地方领导干部毛泽东思想学习班，组织原省、市委机关和各大专院校以及军管的厂矿企业的领导干部参加学习。这些干部在文化大革命运动中，不少人犯有这样那样的错误，有的执行了资产阶级反动路线，有的站错了队。学习班发扬我党延安整风精神，运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，热情地帮助他们学习毛主席的最新指示，搞好斗私批修；积极地帮助他们总结经验教训，发扬成绩，改正错误，更好地理解、掌握毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；鼓励他们放下包袱，大踏步地跟上形势，跟上无产阶级的革命队伍。从去年十月到现在，已办了三期，参加学习的各级领导干部，经过斗私批修，精神面貌焕然一新。在学习过程中，他们把自己斗私的体会，作为向本单位革命派的检查，并以小学生的态度，经常回本单位征求群众意见，争取革命群众的帮助，因而得到革命群众的谅解和信任。许多革命领导干部在他们所在单位成立革命委员会时，参加了三结合的领导班子。
    学习班领导遵照毛主席关于绝大多数干部是好的、要团结干部的大多数的教导，对干部的状况作了认真的分析和研究，相信干部的大多数，团结干部的大多数，相信干部自我改造的自觉性，肯定了这些干部忠于毛主席，要跟毛主席干革命的基本方面。从这一基本观点出发，学习班以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席最新指示和“老三篇”为思想武器，帮助干部狠抓“四忆四查”的阶级教育。就是：（一）忆毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和方法，查自己在文化大革命中的思想、立场和态度；（二）忆文化大革命以来，毛主席对干部问题的一系列伟大指示，查自己在文化大革命中所犯的错误及其根源和危害；（三）忆阶级仇、民族恨和革命先烈的流血牺牲，查自己在和平环境中逐渐忘记阶级斗争、忘记将革命进行到底的忘本思想；（四）忆毛主席对干部的培养、教育，查自己“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想。
    在回忆对比中，许多革命领导干部作了深刻检查，大大激发了他们的无产阶级的阶级觉悟，在灵魂深处爆发了革命。有的同志开始认为自己革命几十年，怎么能说阶级立场有问题呢。通过忆查，想过去艰苦斗争生活，查今天革命意志衰退，确实忘记了过去的苦。他们深有感触地说，今天为什么怕群众，就是因为头脑里有“私”字，忘记了阶级斗争，自己不革命就必然反对群众革命。有的干部深刻地检查了自己在全国解放后居功骄傲、和平演变的错误，愤怒控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义路线对自己的毒害。经过忆查教育，大家认识到，在阶级斗争面前，不斗掉“私”字就不能换来“敢”字。为了保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一定要在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中打倒“私”字，勇敢地站出来革命，在文化大革命中立新功。
    实践证明：“四忆四查”的阶级教育，是激发领导干部革命自觉性，搞好斗私批修的一种好方法。这样做的结果，使干部进一步懂得了毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，进一步理解了毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大教导，为自觉地斗私批修，增长了无穷的力量，斗私批修就在高度自觉的基础上普遍展开。
    在斗私过程中，学习班引导、帮助干部集中在正确对待群众，正确对待自己这些重要问题上进行，对照毛主席的最新指示，检查自己的错误。许多人斗私时说，毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，到学习班前，就学过好多遍，由于“私”字作怪，不能真正理解，没有落实。相反，埋怨群众对自己要求过严。大家认识到，带着“私”字学习毛主席的最新指示，只能各取所需，这是最大的私，是对毛主席最大的不忠。有些人原来认为是群众不解放自己，是群众不让自己站出来。经过斗私后，认识提高了，他们说，有了“怕”字就不敢站出来，不斗倒“私”字，就不能从“私”字中解放出来。干部能不能站出来，关键是干部自己能不能按毛主席最新指示办事，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，勇敢地起来革命。
    通过忆查和斗私批修，这些领导干部提高了阶级觉悟，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想更加崇拜。许多同志检查自己犯错误的原因时说，最根本的是没有时时、事事、处处听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。回到本单位以后，他们坚持活学活用毛主席著作，按毛主席的指示办事。有的还和群众组织一起大办毛泽东思想学习班，带头斗私批修。有一个单位的宣传部副部长，过去他怕揭发党委的问题把自己牵连进去。经过学习，不仅自己积极揭发，还主动做干部工作，发动干部大胆揭发问题，推动这个单位的革命大批判深入开展。某设计院的一个负责干部，本单位的一派要批判他。经过学习，他回院首先到这一派去作检查，听取群众的批评，因为检查深刻，真正触及了灵魂，群众很满意。接着，他又积极作两派群众的工作，促进了两派的革命大联合，使这个院的革命和生产都蓬勃发展。
