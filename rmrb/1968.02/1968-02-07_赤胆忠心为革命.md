		Loyalty and Bravery for the Revolution
		Chen Qingluan, Former Squad Leader of Du Fengrui's Squad

		The Chinese Khrushchev is full of selfishness. Wherever he goes, he barks at our Party members: "Personal interests must be taken care of; without personal interests, there can be no collective interests." Look! He places personal interests above everything else. He is thoroughly reactionary!

		Chairman Mao teaches us: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, and active, placing revolutionary interests as his first priority and subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests." In the minds of Communist Party members, only the "public" should prevail, and the "private" should not exist. We should use Mao Zedong Thought to guide every action and every second of our lives. This is the requirement of the revolution. Our close comrade, Du Fengrui, in a dogfight with the Kuomintang bandits, saw his comrades being attacked by enemy planes. Forgetting his own wounds, with boundless love for his class brothers and deep hatred for the enemy, he single-handedly charged into the enemy formation, fiercely attacking the enemy and firing revengeful shells, shooting down two enemy planes and achieving victory in the air battle. He himself sacrificed his life heroically. His spirit of heroic sacrifice shines with the brilliant light of communist ideology, singing a triumphant song of "public" spirit, embodying the boundless loyalty of revolutionary soldiers and Communist Party members to Mao Zedong Thought.

		In the execution of missions, especially in combat against the enemy, we often face life-and-death choices. This is the most severe test of whether we are public-spirited or self-centered. Over the years, our squad members have remembered the words of Vice Chairman Lin to our troops: "Learn from Comrade Du Fengrui's brave and tenacious fighting style." Following in the footsteps of the heroes, we have smashed the "private" spirit and established the "public" spirit firmly, with loyalty and bravery for the revolution. The former squad leader, Gao Jianfeng, during a mission, the aircraft engine suddenly stopped in mid-air, causing the aircraft to lose balance and plunge rapidly. When he saw that the aircraft was descending towards a densely populated village, he thought that if the aircraft crashed, it would immediately become a sea of fire. At this critical moment, should he bail out and abandon the aircraft to protect his own life, or should he protect the safety of state property and the people? Mao Zedong Thought guided him: "Our responsibility is to the people." He maneuvered the aircraft towards an uninhabited area while calmly restarting the engine, successfully restarting it.

		We deeply understand that only by having "public" spirit in our hearts can we fight for the people throughout our lives; only then can we stand up in a split second, sacrifice ourselves for others, and bravely dedicate ourselves to the revolution and the people. If we do not fiercely combat the "private" spirit in our daily lives and thoroughly reform our worldview, in a split second, as soon as the "private" spirit rears its head, it will bring unimaginable losses to the revolutionary cause.

		Following in the footsteps of the heroes, at critical moments, in every action of each flight, and in every second of time, we wage a battle against the "public-private fusion" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. We must redouble our efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, combat selfishness and criticize revisionism, consciously break away from selfishness and establish public-spiritedness, and use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy our ideological positions and guide our battles.

    赤胆忠心为革命
    杜凤瑞生前所在中队中队长　陈庆鸾
    中国赫鲁晓夫满脑子是私，他跑到那里就在那里向我们党员狂吠：“个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益就没有集体利益。”看！他是个人利益高于一切。真是反动透顶！
    毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。在我们共产党员的头脑里，只能让“公”字占领，不能让“私”字生存；用毛泽东思想去指挥我们的每一个行动，统帅我们生命的每一秒钟，这是革命的需要。我们的亲密战友杜凤瑞同志，他在一次和蒋匪飞贼的空战中，看到战友受敌机围攻，便忘掉了自己负伤，怀着对阶级兄弟无限的爱，对敌人刻骨的恨，单机冲进敌机群，狠狠咬住敌人，射出复仇的炮弹，一举击落敌机两架，取得了空战胜利。他自己壮烈牺牲了。他这种英勇牺牲的精神，闪烁着共产主义思想灿烂光辉，是一曲“公”字的凯歌，体现了我们革命战士、共产党员无限忠于毛泽东思想的一颗红心。
    在执行任务特别是对敌作战中，常常面对着生死的抉择，这是对我们为公还是为私的最严峻的考验。几年来，我们中队同志，牢记林副主席给我们部队的题词：“学习杜凤瑞同志的英勇顽强的战斗作风”。踏着英雄的足迹战斗，“私”字破得狠，“公”字立得牢，赤胆忠心为革命。前任中队长高健功同志，在一次执行任务中，飞机发动机在空中突然停车，飞机失去平衡，急速地下坠。当他看到飞机下滑的地方，是密密麻麻的村镇，想到飞机一坠地，即刻会是一片火海。在这千钧一发的时刻，是跳伞扔掉飞机保护自己生命安全，还是保护国家财产和人民生命的安全呢？毛泽东思想指挥他战斗：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”他一边操纵飞机向没有村镇的方向滑去，一边沉着地重开发动机，终于开车成功了。
    我们深深体会到，心里只有装着“公”字，才能做到在生命全部过程中时时为人民战斗；才能在“一刹那”间，挺身而出，舍己为人，为革命为人民英勇献身。如果平时不狠斗“私”字，不彻底改造世界观，在“一刹那”间，只要“私”字一露头，都会给革命事业带来不可想象的损失。
    我们踏着英雄的足迹，在紧要的关头，在每一次飞行的每一个动作，每一秒钟的时间里，都向中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“公私溶化”论开战，彻底批判他的修正主义谰言。我们一定要加倍努力地活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，自觉地破私立公，用毛泽东思想占领我们的思想阵地，指挥我们战斗。
