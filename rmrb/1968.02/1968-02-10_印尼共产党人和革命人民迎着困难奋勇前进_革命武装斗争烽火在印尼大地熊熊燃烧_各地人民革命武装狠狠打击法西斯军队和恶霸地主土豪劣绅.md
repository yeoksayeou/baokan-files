Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people are bravely advancing despite hardships. The flames of revolutionary armed struggle are burning fiercely across Indonesian soil. Revolutionary armed forces in various regions are striking hard at the fascist military and local tyrants, landlords, and evil gentry.

	BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people are bravely advancing despite hardships. In the first month of this year, they have achieved new victories in their revolutionary armed struggle. In this month, they launched armed uprisings in large areas of East Java and ignited the torch of revolutionary armed struggle in East Kalimantan. In West Kalimantan, the people's revolutionary armed forces continued a series of battles with the counter-revolutionary armed forces of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime.

	According to Western news agencies, in January, Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people carried out armed activities in the rural areas and suburban towns of eight regions in East Java: Tulungagung, Madiun, Kediri, Trenggalek, Wonosobo, Ngawi, Malang, and Jember. They struck hard at the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and local landlords, tyrants, and evil gentry. Revolutionary people took up arms to fight back, executing thirteen landlord tyrants near Madiun and a batch of counter-revolutionaries in the Tulungagung region. According to Suharto-Nasution's fascist regime's Attorney General Suji Atto, revealed in mid-January, in the East Java region, a people's revolutionary armed force known as the "Surabaya People's Guerrilla" is conducting guerrilla activities.

	The Antara News Agency acknowledged in a report that the rise of people's revolutionary struggles in various parts of East Java is a "planned action." It also stated that under the impact of the people's revolutionary storm, "some villages are left unguarded," and local reactionary forces are in a state of panic.

	According to reports, in January, the sound of revolutionary guns also began to echo in East Kalimantan. A people's revolutionary armed force engaged in a fierce battle with the reactionary army of the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime in the Krayan region of East Kalimantan in late January.

	According to some messages from Jakarta, the people's revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan, described by Western news agencies as "powerful guerrilla forces," engaged in a series of battles with the reactionary army on January 2nd, 4th, 14th, 18th, and 21st. On January 4th, the people's revolutionary armed forces ambushed a patrol squad of the reactionary army in the Seblau region of West Kalimantan.

	On January 21st, they struck a part of the main force of the Silivangie Division of the Suharto-Nasution fascist army in the northwest of Menggala.

    新华社九日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚共产党人和革命人民迎着困难奋勇前进，革命武装斗争在今年头一个月传出了新的捷报。在这个月里，他们在东爪哇的大片地区举行了武装暴动，在东加里曼丹点燃了革命武装斗争的火炬。在西加里曼丹，人民革命武装在这个月里，同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的反革命武装继续进行了一系列的战斗。
    据西方通讯社透露，印尼共产党人和革命人民今年一月份，在东爪哇的土隆阿贡、勿里达、谏义里、任抹、外南梦、新埠头、玛琅和牙威等八个地区的农村和市镇郊区，展开了武装活动，狠狠地打击了苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权及当地的地主恶霸、土豪劣绅。革命人民拿起武器展开斗争，在勿里达附近地区处决了十三名地主恶霸，在土隆阿贡地区也处决了一批反革命分子。另据苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的最高检察长苏吉·阿托今年一月中旬透露，在东爪哇地区，有一支名为“泗水人民游击队”的人民革命武装正在进行游击活动。
    安塔拉通讯社在一则消息中承认，东爪哇各地人民革命斗争的兴起是一个“有计划的行动”；并且说，在人民革命风暴的冲击下，“有一些乡村已经没有人守卫”，地方反动势力惶恐不安。
    据报道，今年一月份，在东加里曼丹的土地上，也开始响起了革命的枪声。一支人民革命武装今年一月下旬在东加里曼丹的克拉延地区，同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的反动军队进行了一次激烈的战斗。
    据从雅加达传出的一些消息，被西方通讯社称为“强大的游击队”的西加里曼丹人民革命武装，在一月二日、四日、十四日、十八日和二十一日，同反动军队进行了一系列的战斗。一月四日，人民革命武装在西加里曼丹的塞巴劳地区伏击了反动军队的一支巡逻队。
    一月二十一日，他们又在孟加影西北部，打击了苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军队的主力西利万吉师的一部。
