Chairman Mao has taught us: "Conducting study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." This investigative report once again provides us with very convincing material: as long as a unit firmly believes in and sincerely implements Chairman Mao's instructions to conduct study classes, and persistently holds them session after session, it can solve problems one by one and lead the revolution and work towards victory.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Qingdao Vehicle Factory, there were many tasks to be undertaken. They did not get bogged down in the myriad of details but instead focused on the fundamental task of conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and earnestly pursued it to the end. The result was that the study classes became better and better, and problems were solved one by one. Their attitude of earnestly doing things is very commendable; for those units that currently say they are conducting study classes but do not do so seriously, or those that grasp the task loosely and start and stop, it is even more worth learning from.

Chairman Mao has taught us: "We should be honest in doing things; to accomplish a few things in the world, an honest attitude is essential."

Chairman Mao also pointed out: "The Party committee must not only 'grasp' the main tasks but must also 'grasp them tightly.' Only by grasping things very tightly and without letting go can they be grasped. If one grasps loosely, it is as good as not grasping at all."

As long as we earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, and persist in conducting study classes like Qingdao Vehicle Factory, using the arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the targets of various active thoughts among the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, we will definitely be able to conduct the study classes well, truly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and turn them into a great force for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    学习班要坚持办下去
    本报评论员
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”这篇调查报告，再次给我们提供了一份很有说服力的材料：一个单位只要坚信不疑地、切切实实地遵照毛主席的教导办事，把学习班办起来，一期一期地坚持办下去，就能逐个逐个地解决问题，把革命和工作引向胜利。
      青岛车辆厂革命委员会成立后，要抓的工作很多。他们没有陷入千头万绪之中，而是突出抓住办毛泽东思想学习班这件带根本性的大事，老老实实地一抓到底。其结果是学习班越办越好，问题一个一个得到解决。他们这种老老实实办事的态度，很值得提倡；对目前某些说办学习班，而又不认真地办，或者抓而不紧、办办停停的单位来说，更值得学习。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们应该是老老实实地办事；在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。”
    毛主席还指出：“党委对主要工作不但一定要‘抓’，而且一定要‘抓紧’。什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”
    我们只要认真执行毛主席的教导，象青岛车辆厂这样长期坚持办学习班，用毛泽东思想之矢，射广大革命群众和革命干部各种活思想之的，那就一定能把学习班办好，真正把毛主席的最新指示落实下去，化为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的巨大力量。
