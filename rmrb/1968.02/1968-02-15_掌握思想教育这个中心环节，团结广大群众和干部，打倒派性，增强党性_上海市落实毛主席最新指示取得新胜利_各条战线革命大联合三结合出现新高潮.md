Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and inspired by the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, Shanghai, the city with the highest concentration of the Chinese working class, has seen a new high tide of consolidating and developing revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination since the beginning of this year. This is a continuation of the great "January Revolution" and a development of the high tide of revolutionary great alliances in September last year. It marks that the revolutionary masses and cadres of Shanghai have achieved new brilliant victories in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, laying a solid foundation for achieving an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1968.

The new high tide of revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination in Shanghai this time has the following characteristics: various fronts have further comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, concentrated superior forces, firmly grasped the central link of ideological education, leaders have taken it seriously, and the masses have promoted it eagerly. They have launched a people's war to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in a down-to-earth manner, with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," pushing forward the revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination in the entire city comprehensively and rapidly. In factories and enterprises, which play an important role in the national economy, as well as some influential colleges and universities, revolutionary committees have been established one after another; some "hard-to-handle" units have also caught up, presenting a new situation. In this way, the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the fate of the socialist economy have been more firmly grasped in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

The working class takes the lead, and the Red Guards follow closely

In this new high tide, the working class of Shanghai has once again taken the lead. The number of units that have achieved revolutionary great alliances in factories and enterprises across the city has developed to 97% of the total. The twelve industrial bureaus at the municipal level have now all achieved the three-in-one combination. The number of basic factories and enterprises under these industrial bureaus that have established revolutionary committees has rapidly developed to 74% of the total. In the transportation, commerce, and agriculture sectors, in addition to the units that have already established revolutionary committees last year, the transportation bureau, grain bureau, commerce bureau II, fishery bureau, and agriculture bureau have successively established temporary power organs of the three-in-one combination. The revolutionary little generals of the Red Guards have closely followed the steps of the working class. In a short period, Tongji University, Fudan University, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai Institute of Physical Education, Shanghai Railway Medical College, Shanghai Foreign Trade College, and other institutions have all achieved the three-in-one combination. Together with the seven colleges and universities that have already achieved the three-in-one combination in the past, such as Tongji University and East China Normal University, more than half of the colleges and universities in Shanghai have established revolutionary committees. The number of middle schools and primary schools that have achieved the three-in-one combination has also developed to more than 200 and 1,000 respectively. The situation of revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination in districts and counties is also unprecedentedly good. Eight out of the ten districts in the city have established revolutionary committees.

Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more and more numerous and better, and the class consciousness of the revolutionary masses is getting higher and higher

The appearance of this new high tide of consolidating and developing revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination in Shanghai is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The facts have once again proven that once the great Mao Zedong Thought is combined with the broad masses, it becomes an atomic bomb of infinite power, promoting the rapid development of the revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link for uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle." Strengthening ideological and political work, and holding more and better Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the most fundamental reason for the rapid development of revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination in Shanghai. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are the best form of ideological education and the best classroom for learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice, where the masses educate themselves. Since the beginning of the year, various fronts in Shanghai, from leading organs to grassroots units, from factories, shops, schools, neighborhoods to rural people's communes, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have become more and more numerous and better. Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers and officers, with deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have linked the struggle of their own units and departments, opened their minds, discussed and summarized the experience of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions without any discount. The Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the Shanghai Municipal Transportation Bureau carried out the "Three Remembrances and Three Examinations" activities. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres participating in the study class recalled the bitterness of class struggle, the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, and the poisoning of the black "Cultivation," combined with the practical struggle of the Cultural Revolution, examined their loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; examined their firmness in executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and grasping the correct direction of the revolutionary struggle; examined whether their stand and thoughts were correct or not. This vivid class education course greatly enhanced their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and thus smoothly established the bureau's revolutionary committee. During this period, the representative meetings held in many industries and some regions have also played a significant role in raising awareness, unifying understanding, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Overthrowing factionalism, strengthening party spirit, and firmly establishing the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Resolutely overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and firmly establishing the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people is another important reason for the rapid consolidation and development of revolutionary great alliances and the achievement of the three-in-one combination in many units in Shanghai recently. The revolutionary masses and cadres of Shanghai's proletariat have learned from the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and PLA Daily, deeply realizing the serious harm of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to the revolution. The facts of class struggle exposed in the articles "Proletarian Revolutionary Masses, Unite!" by the editorial departments of Wenhui Daily, Liberation Daily, and Worker Rebel News have made the proletarian revolutionary masses and cadres of Shanghai concretely see the facts of the enemy using factionalism to cover up the enemy, further arousing their hatred for bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Many units immediately launched a people's war to eliminate factionalism, making factionalism a "rat crossing the street" that everyone shouts to beat. Many units have quickly achieved the three-in-one combination after overcoming factionalism. The experience of many units, including Fudan University, has proven that to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, one must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible weapon, follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "each making self-criticism," strictly require oneself, and continuously strengthen proletarian party spirit. If one only criticizes others for having factionalism and does not or rarely talks about one's own factionalism, using factionalism to oppose factionalism, factionalism will not only not be overthrown but will also become more and more numerous and more and more inflated.

Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions without any discount, correctly solving the cadre problem

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key problem for implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great alliances, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of one's own unit. It must be solved well." The proletarian revolutionary masses and cadres of Shanghai have implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions without any discount, correctly solving the cadre problem. This is another important reason for the consolidation and development of revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination in batches of units in Shanghai. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly believe in the majority of cadres, and strictly distinguish between two different types of contradictions. They not only strictly prevent a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries within the party from infiltrating into the leading bodies of the three-in-one combination but also boldly liberate cadres and boldly use cadres, absorbing real revolutionary cadres into the revolutionary committees. Many units' proletarian revolutionary masses and cadres, when preparing to establish revolutionary committees, put the revolutionary situation first and, for cadres with significant differences in opinions and problems that are difficult to resolve temporarily, temporarily set them aside, adopting the principle of "easy first, difficult later, and step-by-step resolution," avoiding delaying the establishment of the revolutionary committee because of the problem of one or two cadres. Some units, when encountering the problem of temporarily not having appropriate combination objects for cadres at the same level, look downwards and select outstanding cadres from the lower level to participate, making the leading bodies of the three-in-one combination established as soon as possible. The proletarian revolutionary masses of Shanghai have universally felt in the process of establishing revolutionary committees: as a temporary power organ, the revolutionary committee is produced in the struggle and also needs to be gradually improved in the continuous struggle. It is unrealistic to require this new thing to be very perfect from the beginning of its establishment, and even delay its establishment because of the concern that it is not perfect. Their understanding has greatly helped the smooth progress of the three-in-one combination work.

Breaking through one point, gaining experience, and promoting overall progress

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In whatever work we communists do, there are two methods that must be adopted: one is the combination of the general and the individual, and the other is the combination of leadership and the masses." According to the leadership method advocated by Chairman Mao, many departments and industries in Shanghai have adopted the approach of breaking through one point, gaining experience, and promoting overall progress. Between upper-level organs and grassroots units, between departments, and between leaders and the masses, they promote and drive each other, making various departments and industries in Shanghai appear a new high tide of consolidating and developing revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination. The responsible comrades and some leading members of the municipal revolutionary committee have gone deep into the grassroots and the masses, specifically helping Tongji University, Fudan University, and many important departments and units to do a good job in revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination, gaining experience from these units; and using these experiences to guide other units. An important reason why some counties in the suburbs have quickly achieved revolutionary great alliances this time is that, under the specific guidance of the responsible comrades of the municipal revolutionary committee, the problem of Songjiang County was first solved, and then the experience of Songjiang was promoted, greatly accelerating the process of revolutionary great alliances in other counties.

In this high tide, many units that have already achieved the three-in-one combination have organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to some units in the same industry to share experiences, introduce the experience of establishing revolutionary committees, exchange experiences, and promote each other. Some hospitals in Huangpu District that have established revolutionary committees earlier have organized "three-in-one combination" Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to hospitals that are preparing to establish revolutionary committees to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, introduce the experience and feelings of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promote the quick achievement of the three-in-one combination in 17 medical districts and clinics.

The appearance of this new high tide of revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination has promoted the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai to develop greatly. The proletarian revolutionary masses of Shanghai understand that the current revolutionary situation is good, the tasks are heavy, and they must continue to make efforts, prevent complacency and arrogance, and advance by leaps and bounds, insisting on Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, highlighting proletarian politics, and thoroughly criticizing and exposing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. At present, revolutionary committees at all levels in the city are continuing to hold and improve various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taking Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, learning and implementing the resolution of the first anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, summarizing experiences, carrying forward achievements, correcting shortcomings, and determining to seize an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

    掌握思想教育这个中心环节，团结广大群众和干部，打倒派性，增强党性
    上海市落实毛主席最新指示取得新胜利  各条战线革命大联合三结合出现新高潮
    据新华社上海十三日电　本社记者述评：在我们伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下，在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势的鼓舞下，我国工人阶级最集中的城市上海，今年以来出现了热火朝天的巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合的新高潮。这是伟大的“一月革命”的继续，是去年九月革命大联合高潮的发展。它标志着上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在落实毛主席的最新指示的工作上取得了新的辉煌胜利，为一九六八年夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利打下了坚实的基础。
    上海市这次出现的革命大联合、革命三结合新高潮的特点是：各条战线进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，集中优势力量，紧紧掌握思想教育这个中心环节，头头抓得紧，群众促得紧，扎扎实实地掀起一场围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，把全市的革命大联合和革命三结合全面地迅速地推向前进。在国民经济中占重要地位的工厂、企业，以及一些有影响的高等学校，革命委员会纷纷建立起来；一些“老大难”的单位，也迎头赶上，出现了崭新的局面。这样就把上海的无产阶级文化大革命的命运，无产阶级专政的命运，社会主义经济的命运，更进一步、更牢固地紧紧掌握在无产阶级革命派的手中。
    工人阶级一马当先，红卫兵紧紧跟上
    在这次新高潮中，上海的工人阶级又是一马当先。全市工厂、企业已经实现革命大联合的单位发展到占总数的百分之九十七。市一级的十二个工业局现在已经全部实现了革命三结合。这些工业局所属的基层工厂、企业，建立革命委员会的单位也迅速发展到占总数的百分之七十四。交通、财贸、农业部门，除去年已经成立革命委员会的单位以外，现在又有交通运输局、粮食局、商业二局、水产局和农业局，相继建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构。革命的红卫兵小将紧跟工人阶级的步伐，在短短时间内，交通大学、复旦大学、上海师范学院、上海体育学院、上海铁道医学院、上海外贸学院等，都实现了革命的三结合。这样，连同过去已经实现革命三结合的同济大学、华东师范大学等七所高等院校在内，上海已经有一半以上的高等学校建立了革命委员会。中学和小学已经实现革命三结合的单位也分别发展到了二百多所和一千多所。区、县革命大联合和革命三结合的形势也是空前大好。全市十个区中已经有八个区建立了革命委员会。
    毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好，革命群众阶级觉悟越来越高
    上海这次巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合新高潮的出现，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。事实再次证明，伟大的毛泽东思想一旦和广大群众相结合，就变成威力无穷的精神原子弹，推动革命迅猛发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”大力加强思想政治工作，更多更好地举办毛泽东思想学习班，这是上海市革命大联合、革命三结合迅猛发展的最根本的原因。毛泽东思想学习班是进行思想教育的最好形式，是活学活用毛泽东思想，群众自己教育自己的最好课堂。新年以来，上海各条战线，从领导机关到基层单位，从工厂、商店、学校、街道到农村人民公社，毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。广大革命群众、革命干部和解放军指战员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的阶级感情，联系本单位、本部门的斗争实际，敞开思想，议论和总结一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争经验，不折不扣地落实毛主席最新指示。上海市交通运输局举办的毛泽东思想学习班，进行了“三忆”“三查”的活动，参加学习的无产阶级革命派和革命干部，在学习班里忆阶级苦，忆受资产阶级反动路线的迫害，忆黑《修养》对自己的毒害，结合文化大革命以来的斗争实践，查自己对毛主席、对毛泽东思想忠不忠；查自己执行毛主席的革命路线、掌握革命斗争大方向坚定不坚定；查自己的立场和思想感情对头不对头。这一堂生动的阶级教育课，大大提高了他们坚决执行毛主席最新指示的自觉性，从而顺利地建立了局的革命委员会。这一时期，许多行业和部分地区分别举行的代表会议，对于提高觉悟，统一认识，落实毛主席最新指示也起了很大作用。
    打倒派性，增强党性，牢固树立全心全意为人民服务的观点
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，牢固树立全心全意为人民服务的观点，这是上海最近以来许多单位迅速巩固和发展革命大联合、实现革命三结合的又一个重要原因。上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论，深刻认识到资产阶级、小资产阶级派性对革命的严重危害。《文汇报》、《解放日报》、《工人造反报》编辑部文章《无产阶级革命派，联合起来！》所揭露的怵目惊心的阶级斗争的事实，使上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众具体地看到了敌人利用派性，派性掩护敌人的事实，更激起了对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的痛恨。许多单位立即发动了一场围剿派性的“人民战争”，使派性成为“过街老鼠”，人人喊打。许多单位就是在克服派性之后，迅速地实现了革命的三结合。复旦大学等许多单位的经验证明，要铲除资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，一定要牢牢掌握毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的武器，遵循毛主席“各自多做自我批评”的教导，严格地要求自己，不断增强无产阶级党性。如果只指责别人有派性，不讲或少讲自己的派性，以派性反派性，派性不但打不倒，而且会越来越多，越来越膨胀。
    不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，正确地解决干部问题
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席这一最新指示，正确地解决干部问题。这是上海成批的单位巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合的再一个重要原因。他们遵循毛主席的教导，坚决相信干部的大多数，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。他们既严防党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务、反革命分子混进革命的三结合领导班子，又大胆地解放干部，大胆地使用干部，把真正的革命干部吸收到革命委员会里来。许多单位的无产阶级革命派和革命群众在筹建革命委员会的时候，以革命大局为重，对于双方意见分歧大，问题又一时难以搞清的干部，就暂时放一放，采取“先易后难、逐步解决”的原则，避免因为某一两个干部的问题没有解决，而拖延了革命委员会的建立。有些单位遇到同级领导干部暂时没有适当的结合对象，就眼睛向下，选拔下级优秀干部参加，使革命三结合领导班子尽快建立起来。上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众在建立革命委员会的过程中，普遍体会到：作为临时权力机构的革命委员会，它是在斗争中产生的，也需要在不断斗争中逐步完善。要求这个新生事物一开始建立就十分完善，甚至因为担心它不完善而推迟建立，是不现实的。他们的这个认识，大大有助于革命三结合工作的顺利开展。
    突破一点，取得经验，带动全面
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”按照毛主席所提倡的这一马克思列宁主义的领导方法，上海市许多部门、行业采取了突破一点，取得经验，带动全面的做法。在上级机构与基层单位之间，部门与部门之间，头头与群众之间，互相促进，互相推动，促使上海各部门、行业出现了巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合的新高潮。市革命委员会的负责人和一些领导成员深入基层，深入群众，具体帮助交通大学、复旦大学和许多重要部门和单位搞好革命大联合和革命三结合，从这些单位取得经验；并利用这些经验，去指导其他单位。郊区一些县这次能够迅速实现革命大联合，重要的原因之一，是在市革委会负责人的具体指导下，首先解决了松江县的问题，然后推广松江的经验，大大加快了其他一些县革命大联合的进程。
    在这次高潮中，许多已经实现革命三结合的单位还组织了毛泽东思想宣传小分队到同行业的一些单位去传经，介绍建立革命委员会的体会，交流经验，互相推动。黄浦区先一步建立革命委员会的一些医院，组织了“三结合”的毛泽东思想宣传小分队到正在筹建革命委员会的医院去宣传毛主席最新指示，介绍落实毛主席最新指示的心得、体会，推动了十七个地段医院和门诊部很快实现了革命的三结合。
    这次革命大联合和革命三结合新高潮的出现，推动了上海无产阶级文化大革命大大向前发展。上海无产阶级革命派懂得，当前革命形势大好，任务繁重，必须再接再厉，防松防骄，乘胜前进，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性彻底批倒批臭。目前全市各级革命委员会正在继续大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，学习和贯彻上海市革命委员会成立一周年决议，总结经验，发扬成绩，改正缺点，决心从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
