North Korean Chargé d'Affaires Holds Press Conference for Chinese and Foreign Journalists, Denounces U.S. Spy Ship's Intrusion into North Korean Waters as Brazen Act of Aggression

	New China News Agency, February 21st

	The Chargé d'Affaires of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's Embassy in China, Kim Jae-suk, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing today. He spoke about the recent incident involving the U.S. imperialist armed spy ship "Pueblo" intruding into North Korean territorial waters.

	Kim Jae-suk pointed out that the "Pueblo" incident is a blatant act of aggression by U.S. imperialism against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The provocative activities of the U.S. imperialist armed spy ship have been exposed in broad daylight, making it a clear and present criminal offender against Korea. Kim Jae-suk also noted that this serious provocation by U.S. imperialism is an attempt to salvage its failing situation in Vietnam, clearly exposing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. It has already been condemned by the Korean people and people around the world with anger.
