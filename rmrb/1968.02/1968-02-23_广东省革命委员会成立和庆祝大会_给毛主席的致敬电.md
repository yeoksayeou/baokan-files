Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

Today, the sons and daughters of the southern gate of our motherland, who are infinitely loyal to you, report to you, the red sun in our hearts, the brightest and reddest sun, our joyous news of battle: the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee, bathed in the sunlight of your latest instructions, has been born in glory in the great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! On this grand occasion, the sons and daughters of the southern gate of our motherland, with the Red Book close to their hearts, are overflowing with emotion and tears of joy. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times, hailing the great victory of your brilliant thoughts! We sing a thousand times, ten thousand times, singing the glorious achievements of your revolutionary line! We praise a thousand times, ten thousand times, praising the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army, which you personally created and led, in the "three supports, two militaries" work! The hearts of forty million people burst forth with a thunderous voice: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years! The hearts of forty million people coalesce into the most beautiful wish in the world: We wish you, dear Chairman, eternal life! Eternal life!

"The ship of the great sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The sons and daughters of the southern gate of our motherland, nurtured by your brilliant thoughts, in this moment of celebrating victory, how can we forget the battle journey you led us through! More than forty years ago, in those days of "long night, unclear sky over the red county," you came to Guangdong with the great revolutionary ideals of the proletariat, personally established the Peasant Movement Training Institute, nurtured countless revolutionary sparks, ignited a blazing fire everywhere, and launched a swift and powerful peasant revolutionary movement like a storm. Here, you wrote the first volume of the magnificent work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," pointing out the brilliant truth that "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution," illuminating the path to revolutionary victory!

Respected Chairman Mao! In the great struggle of socialist revolution and socialist construction, it is your great teachings on distinguishing between enemies and friends that have enabled us to uncover and smash the enemy's plots to lead our country down the capitalist road, steadfastly following the socialist highway you have pointed out. Your brilliant thoughts, like a strong east wind, have launched a surging tide of agricultural cooperation in Guangdong, submerging those who dreamed of blocking the historical tide in the great torrent of socialist revolution!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the days of the Great Leap Forward, you visited Guangdong time and time again, inspecting cities and villages, giving us the most affectionate guidance and the greatest encouragement. We raised high the red banner of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes that you personally formulated, and advanced bravely on the socialist road!

Most Respected Chairman Mao! In this new era, where the world is under the great banner of your brilliant thoughts, you, with the greatest courage and daring of a proletarian revolutionary leader, launched and led the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, opening a new era in the international communist movement. Your series of great teachings have enabled us to recognize the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and to recognize the most dangerous enemies. Following your teachings, we have focused our hatred on the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, and followed your marching order to "Bombard the Headquarters," organizing a vast revolutionary army to launch a general offensive against the bourgeois headquarters! Following your teachings, we have exposed the true counter-revolutionary face of the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu, who waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, and dragged out this cunningly disguised, extremely malicious counter-revolutionary two-faced character for public display! Following your teachings, we rode the spring breeze of the "January Revolution," carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy, and smashed the counter-revolutionary dreams of restoring capitalism by Tao Zhu, Zhao Ziyang, and their ilk!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Turning the pages of the glorious history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong, which step of the journey was not personally guided by you! Which achievement does not condense your heart's blood! Which victory does not shine with the brilliance of your great thoughts!

At the critical juncture of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, you timely issued the great command that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," sending the heroic People's Liberation Army. Dear comrades-in-arms of the Liberation Army, breathing together, sharing the same fate, fighting together in unity. Dear comrades-in-arms of the Liberation Army, steadfastly implementing the principle of supporting the left and not supporting factions, for all actions and words of revolutionary organizations, if they conform to your brilliant thoughts, they support and wholeheartedly endorse them; if they do not conform to your brilliant thoughts, they educate, criticize, and patiently help them. Dear comrades-in-arms of the Liberation Army, with your brilliant thoughts, you have given us the greatest support, powerfully promoting the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, and establishing immortal merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

We will never forget November 12, 1967, when you personally approved the "Decision on the Guangdong Issue." This is your greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest exhortation to us. We are full of spirit and high morale, forever following the course you have pointed out, advancing, advancing, advancing!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the red sun that never sets in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world! More than forty years of tumultuous years, more than forty years of arduous struggle, more than forty years of tortuous roads, and more than forty years of experience and lessons have made us deeply understand a great truth: following you is victory, following you is happiness, following you is light. We have only one ideal: to be a communist warrior who is infinitely loyal to you, absolutely loyal to you, and forever loyal to you! We have only one resolve: even if the heavens change and the earth changes, our red hearts absolutely loyal to you will never change; even if the mountains move and the seas shift, our firm belief in revering you will never waver! We have only one mission: to let your brilliant thoughts forever shine over all of Guangdong, forever shine over all of China, and forever shine over the world!

"Warriors point to the south, more lush and green." Most Respected Chairman Mao! The sons and daughters of the southern gate of our motherland, who are forever loyal to you, celebrate victory with hearts full of passion; looking to the future, we are full of great aspirations. We solemnly pledge to you: we will definitely hold high the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts, definitely implement your latest instructions better and better, definitely quicken our steps to follow your great strategic deployments, and definitely beat the drums of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution louder and louder!

Respected Chairman Mao! We will definitely take Vice Chairman Lin as our shining example, spend a lifetime reading your books, a lifetime listening to your words, a lifetime acting according to your instructions, and a lifetime being your good warrior. After we take power, in a thousand ways, ten thousand ways, learning your brilliant thoughts is the first thing. In a thousand tasks, ten thousand tasks, implementing your latest instructions is the first priority. We will definitely learn your latest instructions with great eagerness, execute your latest instructions completely and thoroughly, propagate your latest instructions with all our hearts, and defend your latest instructions with loyalty! We will definitely launch a broader and deeper mass movement to learn your brilliant thoughts, establish all kinds of types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and promote the revolutionary academic style that you have always advocated, turning every city and village in Guangdong into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

Respected Chairman Mao! We will definitely follow your great teaching of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," using the brilliant "Old Five Articles" as our weapon, carry out a revolution in our souls, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois "self," thoroughly establish the proletarian "public," thoroughly plant the revolutionary "loyalty," and resolutely overthrow the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, eliminate interference from the right and the ultra-left, and steadfastly follow your great strategic deployments step by step. Promote and consolidate the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, carry out a thorough and deep revolutionary criticism, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of our units, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu and their agents in Guangdong, Zhao Ziyang and their ilk, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, criticizing them deeply and thoroughly, criticizing them down and stinking them out! Make them never be able to rise again!

Respected Chairman Mao! We never forget your great teachings on distinguishing between enemies and friends, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and remember that the southern gate of our motherland faces Hong Kong and Macau, is the vanguard of supporting Vietnam and resisting America, supporting Hong Kong and resisting Britain. We will increase our revolutionary vigilance a thousand times, ten thousand times, to prevent the sabotage plots of domestic and foreign class enemies. We will definitely raise high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," further strengthen military-civilian unity, "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness," and build the southern gate of our motherland into an impregnable anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist steel wall. We will definitely use our greatest strength to support the struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon against British violence, use our greatest strength to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, resolutely carry the world revolution to the end, and let the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts fly high and forever fly high in the world!

Most Respected Chairman Mao! No matter how beautiful the language of the world is, it cannot express our infinite love for you; no matter how beautiful the songs of the world are, they cannot sing out our infinite admiration for you; no matter how beautiful the poems of the world are, they cannot write out our infinite loyalty to you! A thousand words, a thousand songs, one sentence, one note: We wish you, dear Chairman, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    广东省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
    给毛主席的致敬电最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    今天，无限忠于您的祖国南方大门的儿女，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，报告我们战斗的喜讯：广东省革命委员会，沐浴着您最新指示的阳光，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大进军中，光荣地诞生了！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在这盛大节日里，祖国南方大门的儿女，红色宝书贴胸口，豪情洋溢喜泪流。我们千遍万遍地欢呼，欢呼您光辉思想的伟大胜利！我们千遍万遍地歌唱，歌唱您革命路线的辉煌战果！我们千遍万遍地赞颂，赞颂您亲自缔造和领导的中国人民解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中创建的又一丰功伟绩！四千万颗红心迸发出震天动地的声音：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！四千万颗红心凝结成世界上最美好的祝愿：敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”毛主席啊，毛主席！您光辉思想哺育成长的祖国南方大门的儿女，在欢庆胜利的幸福时刻，怎能忘记您率领我们走过的战斗历程！四十多年前，在那“长夜难明赤县天”的日子里，您怀着无产阶级的伟大革命理想来到广东，亲自主办农民运动讲习所，培育了无数的革命火种，点燃了漫天遍地的燎原烈火，掀起了暴风骤雨般的迅猛异常的农民革命运动。在这里，您写下了雄文四卷第一篇《中国社会各阶级的分析》，指出了“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”这一光芒四射的伟大真理，照亮了革命的胜利前程！
    敬爱的毛主席！在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大斗争中，是您关于分清敌友的伟大教导，使我们识破和粉碎了敌人妄图把我国引向资本主义道路的阴谋，坚定不移地走您指引的社会主义康庄大道。您的光辉思想，象强劲的东风，掀起了广东农业合作化汹涌澎湃的高潮，把那些梦想阻挡历史潮流的跳梁小丑，淹没在社会主义革命的伟大洪流之中！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在那大跃进的年代里，您一次又一次地亲临广东，视察城市和农村，给了我们最亲切的教导，最巨大的鼓舞。我们高举您亲自制定的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，在社会主义道路上奋勇前进！
    最最敬爱的毛主席！在世界进入了以您的光辉思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，您以无产阶级革命领袖最大的胆略和气魄，发动和领导了人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命，开创了国际共产主义运动的新纪元。您的一系列伟大教导，使我们认清了无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象，认清了最危险的敌人。遵循您的教导，我们把千仇万恨集中在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派身上，紧跟您《炮打司令部》的进军令，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向资产阶级司令部发起了总攻击！遵循您的教导，我们识破了反革命两面派陶铸打着红旗反红旗的反革命真面目，把这个伪装极巧妙、用心极恶毒的反革命两面派揪出来示众！遵循您的教导，我们乘着“一月革命”的春风，发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，粉碎了陶铸、赵紫阳之流复辟资本主义的反革命迷梦！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！掀开广东无产阶级文化大革命的光辉史册，哪一步征程不是您亲自指引！哪一个战果不凝结着您的心血！哪一个胜利不闪耀着您伟大思想的光辉！
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的紧要关头，您及时地发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大命令，派出了英雄的人民解放军。亲人解放军，和我们同呼吸，共命运，团结战斗情谊深。亲人解放军，坚定不移地执行了支左不支派的原则，对革命组织的一切言行，凡是符合您光辉思想的，他们就赞成，就拥护，就大力支持；凡是不符合您光辉思想的，他们就教育，就批评，就耐心帮助。亲人解放军，用您的光辉思想给了我们最大的支持，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋！
    最难忘一九六七年十一月十二日，您亲自批准了《关于广东问题的决定》，这是您对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大教育，最大鞭策。我们意气风发，斗志昂扬，永远沿着您指引的航道，前进，前进，前进！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是中国人民和全世界人民心中永远不落的红太阳！四十多年的峥嵘岁月，四十多年的艰苦斗争，四十多年的曲折道路，四十多年的经验教训，使我们深深懂得了一个伟大的真理：跟着您就是胜利，跟着您就是幸福，跟着您就是光明。我们只有一个理想：做一个无限忠于您、绝对忠于您、永远忠于您的共产主义战士！我们只有一个决心：天变地变，绝对忠于您的红心永远不变；山移海移，无限敬仰您的信念坚定不移！我们只有一个使命：让您的光辉思想，永远普照全广东，永远普照全中国，永远普照全世界！
    “战士指看南粤，更加郁郁葱葱。”最最敬爱的毛主席！永远忠于您的祖国南方大门的儿女，欢庆胜利，豪情满怀；展望未来，壮志凌云。我们向您庄严宣誓：一定要把您光辉思想的伟大红旗举得更高更高，一定要把您的最新指示落实得更好更好，一定要把紧跟您伟大战略部署的步伐迈得更快更快，一定要把夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战鼓擂得更响更响！
    敬爱的毛主席！我们一定以林副主席为光辉榜样，一辈子读您的书，一辈子听您的话，一辈子照您的指示办事，一辈子做您的好战士。我们掌权以后，一千条，一万条，学习您的光辉思想是第一条。千件事，万件事，落实您的最新指示是第一大事。我们坚决做到学习您的最新指示如饥似渴，执行您的最新指示完全彻底，宣传您的最新指示满腔热忱，捍卫您的最新指示赤胆忠心！我们一定要更广泛、更深入地开展学习您光辉思想的群众运动，大办特办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大兴特兴您历来倡导的革命学风，把广东所有的城镇、乡村都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们坚决遵循您“要斗私，批修”的伟大教导，以光辉的“老五篇”为武器，在灵魂深处闹革命，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，大树革命的“忠”字，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，加强无产阶级党性，排除来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，坚定不移地步步紧跟您的伟大战略部署。促进和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，持久深入地开展革命大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，把中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸及其在广东的代理人赵紫阳之流，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭！叫他们永世不得翻身！
    敬爱的毛主席！我们念念不忘您关于分清敌友的伟大教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，牢记祖国南大门面临港澳，是援越抗美、支港抗英的前哨，千倍万倍地提高革命警惕，严防国内外阶级敌人的阴谋破坏。我们一定要高举“拥军爱民”的大旗，更加紧密地加强军民团结，“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，把祖国南大门建设成坚不可摧的反帝反修的钢铁长城。我们一定要用最大的力量支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴的斗争，用最大的力量支援越南人民抗美救国的斗争，坚决把世界革命进行到底，让您光辉思想的伟大红旗，在全世界高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    最最敬爱的毛主席！说尽世界上最美最好的语言，说不尽我们对您的无限热爱；唱尽世界上最美最好的歌曲，唱不尽我们对您的无限敬仰；写尽世界上最美最好的诗篇，写不尽我们对您的无限忠诚！千言万语一句话，千歌万曲一个音：最最衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
