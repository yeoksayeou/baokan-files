The revolutionary masses of the Beijing Knitting Factory, with the assistance of the support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit, have organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have focused on class education and class struggle, fundamentally raising the level of Mao Zedong Thought among the cadres. The vast majority of cadres in the factory have joined the revolutionary masses in the struggle, criticism, and transformation campaign.

Editor's Note: The support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit and the revolutionary masses of the Beijing Knitting Factory have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Starting from education, they have warmly assisted cadres to stand out in the revolution. Their work has been very effective.

Chairman Mao said: "Our party, through the Yan'an Rectification Movement, educated a large number of cadres, united the entire party, and ensured the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. This tradition, we must carry on." We must deeply understand Chairman Mao's great teachings and fully implement Chairman Mao's policies on cadres. Especially at this time when we are striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has become a common task for us proletarian revolutionaries to solve the cadre problem according to Chairman Mao's policies on cadres.

We must understand that revolutionary cadres do not belong to any individual or faction, but belong to the party and are our party's precious wealth. Correctly handling cadres is not just a matter of dealing with an individual, but a matter of attitude towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Therefore, we must stand on the stance of proletarian party spirit and party policy, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue, and start from education, expand the scope of education, and warmly help more cadres to stand out in the revolution. Even if cadres have made serious mistakes, as long as they are not persistent in their errors and are willing to be educated, we must adopt the policy of uniting and educating them.

The proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all humanity. Similarly, the proletarian revolutionaries can only further consolidate our proletarian dictatorship and achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by daring to liberate cadres and absorbing a large number of revolutionary cadres into the revolutionary three-in-one leadership.

New China News Agency, February 13th: The joint reporting team of the capital's news units reported from the Beijing Knitting Factory: The support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses of the factory, have organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "starting from education and expanding the scope of education for cadres," focused on class education and class struggle, fundamentally raised the level of Mao Zedong Thought among the cadres, and helped cadres to stand out in the revolution.

Expanding the Scope of Education, Providing Opportunities for Cadres to Receive Education

The vast majority of cadres in this factory are good or relatively good. However, due to making some mistakes in their work and executing the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the movement, they have been criticized by the masses. When the support-left personnel entered the factory, some cadres were not active in the movement, feared the masses, and had heavy mental burdens. Some masses did not trust them and were unwilling to approach them. As a result, cadres could not stand out, hindering the deepening of the movement.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great alliances, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in this unit. We must solve this problem well. Our party, through the Yan'an Rectification Movement, educated a large number of cadres, united the entire party, and ensured the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. This tradition, we must carry on." The support-left personnel from the 8341st Unit seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre issue and realized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. In a certain sense, it is also a mass movement of re-examining and educating cadres. The issue of educating cadres is a major issue related to consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. They and the proletarian revolutionary masses of the factory, following Chairman Mao's teachings, took various measures to expand the scope of education, giving the vast majority of cadres more opportunities to receive education and raise their proletarian political awareness.

The support-left personnel helped the factory organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, mobilizing more than 95% of the middle and above-level cadres to participate in the study. The cadres brought their problems to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, studying Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, criticizing and repudiating private and bourgeois thoughts, examining their shortcomings and mistakes, and summarizing their experiences and lessons. Recently, the middle and above-level cadres also participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes of various departments, receiving another round of education, further establishing the idea of closely connecting with the masses and wholeheartedly serving the people. The cadres who participated in the study were very moved. They said: This is the greatest care and protection from the great leader Chairman Mao, and the warm assistance from the revolutionary masses.

The support-left personnel and the proletarian revolutionary masses also organized cadres to go to the fiery class struggle to receive education and learn from the masses in a planned and purposeful manner. During the study class, they specially arranged time for cadres to go to the masses to solicit opinions and listen to criticisms. Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions: "We must properly solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around and see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be the students of the masses." They immediately mobilized cadres to go deep into the masses, study Chairman Mao's works with the masses, criticize and repudiate private and bourgeois thoughts with the masses, labor with the masses, and recall bitterness and think of sweetness. The revolutionary mass organizations' report meetings, experience-sharing meetings, and exhibition visits also actively absorbed their participation. They encouraged cadres to actively participate in the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in this unit, fighting together with all the revolutionary masses in the factory to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and criticize and fight against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in this factory. The cadres, in the common struggle with the revolutionary masses and in the practice of class struggle, received tempering, raised their awareness, and further learned the noble qualities of the revolutionary masses' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Focusing on Class Education, Fundamentally Raising the Level of Cadres

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Vice Chairman Lin instructs us to especially strengthen the awareness of class and class struggle. Only then can we have the energy to carry out this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have the determination to carry out this cultural revolution, and be able to keep up with Chairman Mao's great momentum and courage in the cultural revolution. Otherwise, we will always lag behind and always make mistakes.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, the support-left personnel and the proletarian revolutionary masses organized cadres to concentrate time and energy to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on class, class contradictions, and class struggle, study the great historical document personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao—the May 16th Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966 and related commentaries, and carried out recollection and comparison activities: recalling the bitterness of the old society, thinking of the sweetness of the new society, examining one's loyalty to Chairman Mao's class feelings; recalling the bitterness of being poisoned by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the bourgeois reactionary line, thinking of the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, examining one's attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; recalling the party's cultivation of oneself, comparing one's contributions to the revolution, examining one's revolutionary will. They guided cadres to deeply understand that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a very serious and profound class struggle. Under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, the handful of capitalist roaders within the party are the most important and dangerous enemies who attempt to subvert the proletarian dictatorship. They made cadres greatly enhance their hatred towards the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, determined to thoroughly draw a clear line with them, stand with the broad revolutionary masses, and fight and expose this handful of most dangerous enemies.

They organized cadres to combine the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They mobilized everyone to extensively display the glorious achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, extensively display the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, extensively display the meritorious deeds of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, and examine their views on the situation, making cadres further enhance their awareness of class and class struggle and correct their attitudes towards the mass movement.

Originally, some cadres viewed the fiery mass movement as very "chaotic" and saw the minor trends as the main trends. Some cadres were impacted in the movement, felt wronged, and had three kinds of resentment: resentment, discouragement, and unwillingness to accept. Through these educations, everyone realized that without the great mass movement, there would be no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it would be impossible to expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev, it would not be possible to wash away the deeply rooted private ownership concepts in people's minds, uproot the roots of revisionism, and the socialist mountains would change color. The cadres who were impacted changed from blaming the masses for "attacking" them to being grateful to the masses for educating and saving them. Some cadres said: "The masses 'attack' me to eliminate personalistic thoughts and eliminate the breeding ground for revisionism, making me forever follow Chairman Mao in the revolution."

Mobilizing the Masses, Warmly Assisting Cadres

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "For cadres who have made mistakes, generally, the method of persuasion should be adopted to help them correct their mistakes."

The support-left personnel, following Chairman Mao's teachings, actively mobilized the masses in the study class to warmly help cadres recognize and correct their mistakes, promoting cadres to voluntarily stand out in the revolution. At the beginning, some cadres had reservations about contacting the masses. Many revolutionary masses took the initiative to approach them, have heart-to-heart talks with them, help them analyze the nature and causes of their mistakes, express hopes, and make demands. Some even gave cadres the "Little Red Book" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, encouraging them to better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and always listen to Chairman Mao's words. Many cadres were moved to tears. They said: "Revolutionary masses listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and are the most reasonable." Through the heart-to-heart talks, cadres received education from the masses, and the masses better understood the cadres, greatly strengthening the unity between cadres and the masses.

The support-left personnel also paid attention to doing a good job in the ideological and political work of the cadres' families. They and the revolutionary masses of the factory visited the cadres' families one by one, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions and cadre policies to the cadres' families. They also organized the cadres' families to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, conducting in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work, inspiring the families to help the cadres correct their mistakes and stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Some families even held self-criticism meetings, exposing their private thoughts to each other, helping each other, and making progress together.

After a period of education, cadres had a better understanding of their mistakes and generally had the requirement to publicly check their mistakes among the masses. At this time, the support-left personnel and the proletarian revolutionary masses again led the situation, actively creating conditions for cadres to "come out" bravely. The revolutionary masses of various workshops and departments organized themselves, beating drums and gongs to send encouragement letters to the cadres, warmly welcoming the cadres to bravely stand out in the revolution. They held experience-sharing meetings on actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, organized cadres to go on stage to share their experiences, criticize and repudiate private and bourgeois thoughts, and let them fight face-to-face with the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the mass meetings, "coming out on the battlefield."

Now, the vast majority of cadres in the factory have stood out. They are spirited and, together with all the revolutionary masses in the factory, have thrown themselves into the struggle, criticism, and transformation campaign, actively and diligently implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, determined to contribute their strength to achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策从教育着手热情帮助干部站出来革命
    北京针织总厂无产阶级革命派，在八三四一部队支左人员的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级和阶级斗争的教育，从根本上提高了干部的毛泽东思想水平。全厂绝大多数干部同革命群众一起投入斗、批、改高潮
    编者按：八三四一部队支左人员和北京针织总厂的无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从教育着手，热情帮助干部站出来革命。他们的工作做得很有成效。
    毛主席说：“我们党，经过延安整风，教育了广大干部，团结了全党，保证了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。这个传统，我们一定要发扬。”我们一定要深刻地领会毛主席这一伟大教导，不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策。尤其是在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的今天，按照毛主席的干部政策解决干部问题，已经成了我们无产阶级革命派的共同任务。
    应该懂得，革命的干部并不是那一个人的或是那一派的，而是属于党的，是我们党的宝贵财富。正确地对待干部，也决不是对某一个人的问题，而是对毛主席最新指示的态度问题。因此，我们一定要站在无产阶级党性和党的政策的立场，坚决贯彻毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，坚持从教育着手，扩大教育面，热情地帮助更多的干部站出来革命。即使是犯有严重错误的干部，只要他不是坚持不改和累教不改的，就要采取团结教育的方针。
    无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后地解放自己。同样，无产阶级革命派只有大胆地解放干部，把大批革命干部吸收到革命三结合的领导班子里来，才能够进一步巩固我们的无产阶级政权，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    新华社十三日讯　首都新闻单位驻北京针织总厂联合记者组报道：八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员，帮助这个厂的无产阶级革命派大办毛泽东思想学习班，切实落实毛主席关于“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的最新指示，狠抓阶级和阶级斗争的教育，从根本上提高干部的毛泽东思想水平，帮助干部站出来革命。
    扩大教育面，给干部受教育的机会
    这个厂的绝大多数干部是好的和比较好的。但是，不少人由于在工作中犯过一些错误，在运动初期执行过资产阶级反动路线，受到了群众的批判。支左人员进厂的时候，有些干部不积极参加运动，害怕群众，思想包袱很重。部分群众对他们也不信任，不愿接近他们。这样，干部就站不出来，障碍了运动的深入发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。我们党，经过延安整风，教育了广大干部，团结了全党，保证了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。这个传统，我们一定要发扬。”八三四一部队支左人员认真学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，认识到：无产阶级文化大革命运动，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，在某种意义上讲，也是一场重新审查和教育干部的群众运动。教育干部的问题，是关系到巩固无产阶级红色政权的一个重大问题。他们和这个厂的无产阶级革命派，遵照毛主席的教导，采取各种措施，扩大教育面，使绝大多数干部有更多的受教育的机会，提高无产阶级政治觉悟。
    支左人员帮助厂里举办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织全厂百分之九十五以上的中层以上干部参加了学习。干部们带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策；以毛主席最新指示为纲，斗私批修，检查缺点和错误，总结经验教训。最近，中层以上干部又参加了各部门的毛泽东思想学习班，使他们又一次受到了教育，进一步树立了密切联系群众，全心全意为人民服务的思想，参加学习的干部非常感动。他们说：这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们的最大关怀，最大爱护，是广大革命群众对我们的热情帮助。
    支左人员和无产阶级革命派，还有计划、有目的地组织干部到火热的群众斗争中去接受教育，向群众学习。在学习班学习期间，专门安排时间，让干部到群众中去征求意见，听取批评。毛主席发出最新指示：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”他们就立即发动干部，深入群众，和群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起劳动，一起忆苦思甜。革命群众组织的报告会、讲用会、参观展览等活动，也积极吸收他们参加。他们还鼓励干部积极参加革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，同全厂革命群众一起，批判中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委彭真反革命修正主义集团所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批判、斗争本厂党内一小撮走资派。干部们在和革命群众的共同战斗中，在阶级斗争的实践中，受到了锻炼，提高了觉悟，进一步学到了革命群众无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的高贵品质。
    狠抓阶级教育，从根本上提高干部
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”林副主席指示，我们要特别加强阶级的观念，阶级斗争的观念，我们才有劲进行这场无产阶级文化大革命，我们才有决心进行这场文化大革命，我们才能够跟得上毛主席在文化大革命中间这种伟大的气魄和勇气。不然，我们老是跟不上，而且老是犯错误。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，支左人员和无产阶级革命派组织干部集中时间、集中精力反复学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的教导，学习我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》和有关社论，并开展了忆比活动：忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜，查自己忠于毛主席的阶级感情；忆受党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动路线毒害的苦，思毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜，查自己对无产阶级文化大革命的态度；忆党对自己的培养，比自己对革命的贡献，查自己的革命斗志。引导干部深刻认识无产阶级文化大革命，是一场非常严肃、非常深刻的阶级斗争。在无产阶级专政条件下，党内一小撮走资派是颠覆无产阶级专政的最主要、最危险的敌人。使干部们大大增强了对党内一小撮走资派的仇恨心，决心彻底与他们划清界限，与广大革命群众站在一起，把这一小撮最危险的敌人斗倒、斗臭，批深、批透。
    他们组织干部结合无产阶级文化大革命形势，活学活用毛主席的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》，学习毛主席的最新指示。发动大家大摆无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成就，大摆毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，大摆无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的丰功伟绩，对照检查自己对形势的看法，使干部进一步增强了阶级、阶级斗争的观念，端正对群众运动的态度。
    原来有的干部，把轰轰烈烈的群众运动看得很“乱”，把支流看成主流。有的干部在运动中受到冲击，感到委屈，存在着三气：怨气、泄气、不服气。通过这些教育，大家认识到：没有伟大的群众运动，就没有伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，就不可能揪出以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，就不能冲掉在人们头脑中根深蒂固的私有观念，挖掉修正主义的根子，社会主义江山就要改变颜色。受到冲击的干部由埋怨群众“整”自己，转变为感激群众教育和挽救了自己。有的干部说：“群众‘整’自己，是要整掉个人主义思想，整掉产生修正主义的温床，使自己永远跟着毛主席干革命。”
    发动群众，热情帮助干部
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“对于犯错误的干部，一般地应采取说服的方法，帮助他们改正错误。”
    支左人员遵照毛主席的教导，在学习班里，积极发动群众热情帮助干部认识错误，改正错误，促使干部自觉站出来革命。开始，一些干部对接触群众有顾虑，许多革命群众就主动接近他们，找他们谈心，帮助他们分析错误的性质和犯错误的原因，谈希望，提要求。有的还给干部赠送“老五篇”，赠送毛主席最新指示，鼓励他们更好地活学活用毛主席著作，永远听毛主席的话。许多干部感动得热泪盈眶。他们说：“革命群众最听毛主席的话，最通情达理。”通过谈心活动，干部从群众中受到了教育，群众对干部也更了解了，大大密切了干群关系，增强了团结。
    支左人员还注意做好干部家属的思想政治工作。他们和厂里的革命群众一起，挨家逐户地走访干部家庭，向干部家属宣传毛主席的最新指示和干部政策。他们还组织干部家属忆苦思甜，对他们进行深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作，启发家属帮助干部改正错误，站到毛主席的革命路线上来。有的家庭还召开斗私批修会，互相亮私斗私，互相帮助，共同进步。
    经过一段教育，干部对自己的错误有了较好的认识，普遍有了到群众中去公开检查错误的要求。这时，支左人员和无产阶级革命派又因势利导，积极为干部创造站出来“亮相”的条件。各车间、科室的革命群众纷纷组织起来，敲锣打鼓给干部送鼓励信，热情欢迎干部勇敢站出来革命。他们召开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，组织干部登台讲用，斗私批修，并让他们在群众大会上，同党内一小撮走资派进行面对面的斗争，“火线亮相”。
    现在，全厂绝大多数干部都站了出来。他们精神焕发地与全厂革命群众一起，投入了斗、批、改的高潮，积极努力地条条落实、全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，决心为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，贡献自己的力量。
