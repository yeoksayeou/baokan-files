		The telegram said:

		The entire Albanian people are overjoyed to learn that the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people and the South Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have achieved brilliant victories in their war against the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their Saigon puppets. These brilliant victories have added a new and glorious chapter to the outstanding struggle of our Vietnamese brothers to save their country and reunify their homeland.

The resolute struggle and brilliant victories of our Vietnamese brothers have inflicted heavy losses on the U.S. aggressors, foiling their wicked "peace talks" plot in collusion with their lackeys, the modern revisionists.
