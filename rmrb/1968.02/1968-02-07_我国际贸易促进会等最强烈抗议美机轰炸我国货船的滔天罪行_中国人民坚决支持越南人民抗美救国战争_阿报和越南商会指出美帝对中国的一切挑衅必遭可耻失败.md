The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and Others Strongly Protest the Heinous Crime of U.S. Aircraft Bombing Chinese Cargo Ships
The Chinese People Resolutely Support the Vietnamese People's War of Resistance Against America
The Albanian Newspaper and the Vietnamese Commercial Association Point Out That All U.S. Provocations Against China Will Meet with Shameful Failure

	BEIJING, Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the China Ocean Shipping Company today issued a statement strongly protesting the heinous crime of U.S. imperialist bandit aircraft savagely bombing Chinese cargo ships anchored in Vietnamese ports.

	The statement said that after the U.S. imperialist bandits madly attacked the Red Flag 158 cargo ship anchored in the Vietnamese port of Cam Ranh on January 3, they brazenly dispatched aircraft to savagely bomb the Red Flag 152 cargo ship anchored in the Vietnamese port of Vung Tau and the Red Flag 153 cargo ship anchored in Cam Ranh on January 20 and 27. This resulted in multiple injuries to our crew members and severe damage to the ships. This is another deliberate provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people and a major crime. The statement expressed resolute support for the statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on February 1, strongly protesting and condemning this heinous crime by U.S. imperialist bandits.

	The statement once again warned U.S. imperialism: Your attempt to obstruct and disrupt normal trade between China and Vietnam through indiscriminate bombing, and to sabotage and hinder Chinese people's support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America, will never succeed.

	The statement praised the heroic armed forces of the South Vietnamese people for their comprehensive offensive during the Spring Festival, achieving brilliant results. The statement said that the entire staff of the Chinese trade and shipping industries warmly acclaim the great victories of the Vietnamese people and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in continuing their war of resistance against America to the end.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, Feb. 6 -- The Vietnam Democratic Republic Commercial Association issued a statement on Feb. 5, strongly condemning the heinous crime of U.S. imperialist bandit aircraft savagely bombing two Chinese cargo ships anchored in the Vietnamese ports of Vung Tau and Cam Ranh on January 20 and 27.

	The statement pointed out that this bandit act by U.S. imperialism clearly shows that it is still stubbornly and increasingly pursuing its conspiracy to provoke war against the People's Republic of China, committing new crimes against the Chinese people. At the same time, this is a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Vietnam Democratic Republic.

	The statement said that the Vietnam Democratic Republic Commercial Association fully supports the stance outlined in the statement by the Vietnam Democratic Republic Foreign Ministry on February 3 and the stance outlined in the statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on February 1.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Tirana, Feb. 4 -- An editorial in the Albanian newspaper "Unity" on Feb. 4 strongly condemned the savage bombing of Chinese cargo ships anchored in Vietnamese ports by U.S. bandit aircraft, resolutely supporting the Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement on February 1 protesting the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism.

	The article emphasized that the victory and progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the downfall of the clique of power-holders within the Chinese Communist Party who are taking the capitalist road with Liu Shaoqi as their head, and the great achievements China has made in the fields of economy, national defense, politics, and science, especially in breaking the nuclear monopoly of imperialism and revisionism, have caused great unease and panic among imperialists, revisionists, and international reactionaries. The U.S. imperialists vainly hope to obstruct the great seven hundred million Chinese people's aid to the Vietnamese people through provocations against Chinese cargo ships, in order to achieve the goal of blockading and isolating Vietnam. However, no matter what means the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys adopt, their attempt to subjugate the heroic Vietnamese people will never succeed. All provocations planned by the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys against the People's Republic of China will inevitably meet with shameful failure.

    我国际贸易促进会等最强烈抗议美机轰炸我国货船的滔天罪行
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国战争
    阿报和越南商会指出美帝对中国的一切挑衅必遭可耻失败
    新华社六日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会、中国远洋运输公司今天发表声明，最强烈抗议美帝国主义强盗飞机猖狂轰炸我停泊在越南港口货船的滔天罪行。
    声明说，美帝国主义强盗，继一月三日疯狂袭击我停泊在越南锦普港的红旗一五八号货船之后，又悍然于一月二十日和二十七日出动飞机猖狂轰炸我停泊在越南鸿基港的红旗一五二号货船和停泊在锦普港的红旗一五三号货船，使我船员多人受伤，船身多处遭到严重破坏。这是美帝国主义对中国人民的又一次蓄意挑衅，犯下的重大罪行。声明表示坚决支持我外交部一九六八年二月一日的声明，最强烈抗议和声讨美帝国主义强盗的这种滔天罪行。
    声明再一次警告美帝国主义：你们企图用狂轰滥炸来阻挠和捣乱中国和越南的正常贸易，破坏和阻止中国人民对越南人民抗美救国战争的支援，是永远不会得逞的。
    声明赞扬了英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量，春节期间在南越战场上全面出击，取得了辉煌的战果。声明说，中国贸易界和航运界全体工作人员热烈欢呼越南人民的伟大胜利，并坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    据新华社河内六日电  越南民主共和国商会五日发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义一月二十日和二十七日，派遣强盗飞机野蛮轰炸停泊在越南鸿基和锦普港口的两艘中国货船的滔天罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义这一强盗行径，清楚地证明了它依然顽固和变本加厉地推行对中华人民共和国进行战争挑衅的阴谋，对中国人民犯下了新的罪行。同时，这也是对越南民主共和国主权的明目张胆的侵犯。
    声明说，越南民主共和国商会完全支持越南民主共和国外交部二月三日声明中所阐明的立场和中华人民共和国外交部二月一日声明中所阐明的立场。
    据新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》四日发表评论员文章，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机野蛮轰炸停泊在越南港口的中国货船，坚决支持中国外交部二月一日抗议美帝国主义滔天罪行的声明。
    文章强调指出，由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进以及以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的中国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的垮台，中国在经济、国防、政治和科学各个领域里，特别是在打破帝国主义和修正主义核垄断方面所取得的伟大成就，引起了帝国主义者、修正主义者和国际反动派极大的不安和恐慌。美帝国主义者妄想通过对中国货船的挑衅，来阻止伟大的七亿中国人民对越南人民的援助，以便达到封锁和孤立越南的目的。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗无论采取什么手段，他们想要征服英雄越南人民的企图是决不会得逞的。美帝国主义及其走狗策划的反对中华人民共和国的一切挑衅，都必将遭到可耻的失败。
