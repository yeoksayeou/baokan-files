Edition: 4

The Communist Party of China is a great Marxist party founded by the great leader Chairman Mao. It is a vanguard of the proletariat built on the organizational principle of democratic centralism. From the very beginning of the party's founding, Chairman Mao attached great importance to implementing the party's democratic centralism. Chairman Mao pointed out: "To make the party strong, we must rely on implementing the party's democratic centralism to mobilize the enthusiasm of the entire party," "The system of democratic centralism must show its effectiveness in revolutionary struggles." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the principle of democratic centralism has always been consistently implemented in party life, which is a very important factor in ensuring the party's unity and solidarity, strengthening the party's fighting capacity, and overcoming the enemy.

The history of the international communist movement shows that all opportunists, in order to implement their opportunist political line, must implement an organizational line that matches their opportunist political line, and destroy the principle of democratic centralism. The struggle between the Marxist political line and the opportunist political line within the proletarian party is always accompanied by the struggle between implementing democratic centralism and destroying democratic centralism. China's Khrushchev is the biggest opportunist within the party, the chief culprit of implementing the opportunist political line within the party; he is also the biggest destroyer of the party's democratic centralism. His heinous crimes of destroying democratic centralism must be thoroughly exposed and criticized.

(1)

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the people, there must be no freedom without discipline, and no democracy without centralism. This unity of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism."

The party's centralism is based on democracy. It is on the basis of democracy that correct opinions are concentrated, achieving unity of understanding, policy, planning, command, and action. Centralism cannot be separated from democracy; centralism without democracy is personal despotism and personal dictatorship.

China's Khrushchev, the biggest opportunist within the party, is most afraid of the party's democracy, fearing that party members will rise up against him and expose his anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought conspiracies. For many years, he has frantically advocated the reactionary theory of "absolute obedience," using the posture of "I am the party" to instruct party members: "If it is decided by the higher authorities or the Central Committee, it must be obeyed, even if it is wrong, it must be obeyed." He brings the relationship between slave owners and slaves into party life, treating party members as slaves, while he is the slave owner who wields the whip and clapper. Party members must be his "easily controlled" and "tame tools," and must "obey orders" for all his anti-party and anti-socialist black directives, without the slightest resistance. Whoever dares to resist is "denying the absolute nature of the basic principles of democratic centralism," and is "destroying democratic centralism." What is the difference between such a so-called "democratic centralism" and the Kuomintang's "tutelage"? This is not democratic centralism at all; it is sheer personal dictatorship, the fascist system of Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang.

Is there a need for obedience within the party? In order to unify the thoughts and actions of the entire party, making the party a cohesive whole with strong fighting capacity to fight against the enemy, there must be obedience within the party. Individual obedience to the organization, minority obedience to the majority, lower levels obedience to higher levels, and the entire party obedience to the Central Committee, are the party's organizational principles and discipline. Without this necessary obedience, our party will become a loose sand heap, unable to ensure the unity of the party's will and actions, and will lose its fighting capacity. However, this obedience must be based on political correctness, adhering to Mao Zedong Thought and serving the interests of the people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A party that wants to lead the revolution to victory must rely on the correctness of its political line and the consolidation of its organization." "Harmful erroneous leadership that harms the revolution should not be unconditionally accepted, but should be resolutely resisted." Erroneous leadership that harms the revolution cannot represent the interests of the party and the people. Obeying such leadership will lead to setbacks and failures in the revolution, which is to lose revolutionary stance, betray revolutionary principles, and is the greatest disloyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. China's Khrushchev covers up the struggle between the two lines within the party, blurs the line between right and wrong, and attempts to replace the party's democratic centralism with "absolute obedience." This is the greatest distortion and perversion of democratic centralism, which is absolutely unacceptable.

China's Khrushchev poses as the spokesperson of the party, portraying himself as the representative of the party's will. He repeatedly mentions "superiors" and "Central Committee," and whoever dares to oppose his so-called "superiors" and "Central Committee" is "destroying the party's democratic centralism." China's Khrushchev's so-called "superiors" are a small clique within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and China's Khrushchev's so-called "Central Committee" is the bourgeois headquarters led by him. He attempts to use "democratic centralism" as a tight rein to suppress the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary rebellious spirit of party members, preventing the broad masses of party members from rising up to fight against the bourgeois headquarters led by him. This can only be in vain.

Opposing the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, is "destroying democratic centralism"? This is a shameless slander. China's Khrushchev opposes the principles of the party's democratic centralism, using factionalism and bribery to gather a bourgeois headquarters within the party. All the black directives issued from this headquarters are in opposition to Mao Zedong Thought and are not formed on the basis of democracy, and do not represent the demands and will of the broad masses of party members. Ask yourself, among the broad masses of party members in our party, who truly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has ever demanded "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package," or proposed the "parliamentary road" and "peaceful transition"? For decades, China's Khrushchev has been thinking about capitalism, talking about capitalism, and doing capitalism. His actions and deeds have not a single bit that is in the interests of the proletariat, and not a single thing that reflects the demands of the broad masses of party members. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of party members rise up to rebel against China's Khrushchev, which is entirely in accordance with the principles of the party's democratic centralism. Their revolutionary spirit and vigorous revolutionary spirit are truly excellent! Excellent!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The inconsistency between the government and the people in war gives rise to governments that only want centralism without democracy, absolute centralism." Chairman Mao's teachings fundamentally expose the class basis and social basis for the emergence of personal dictatorship. The fundamental opposition between the interests of the exploiting class and the people makes them extremely afraid of the people and dare not grant the people any democratic rights, and can only rely on the policy of fooling the people and fascist dictatorship to barely maintain their rule. China's Khrushchev inherits the legacy of the exploiting class, bringing the relationship between slaves and slave owners into party life, and attempts to use the reactionary theory of "absolute obedience" and "tame tools" to impersonate the party's democratic centralism, in order to consolidate his rule and expose his reactionary stance of the exploiting class. His conspiracy has been thoroughly smashed in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

(2)

The principle of the party's democratic centralism stipulates that the party not only implements high democracy but also implements high centralism. The party's democracy is democracy under centralized guidance. The purpose of promoting the party's democracy is not to weaken the party's unity and centralism, but precisely to strengthen the party's unity and centralism. It is not to weaken the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, but to strengthen the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. China's Khrushchev, the biggest opportunist within the party, plays the counter-revolutionary two-handed game. On the one hand, he distorts the party's centralism into personal dictatorship, attempting to establish his revisionist rule within the party. On the other hand, he promotes bourgeois democracy within the party, implementing bourgeois liberalization, with the purpose of achieving the conspiracy to seize the party and seize power.

China's Khrushchev shouts at the top of his lungs about "letting everyone speak, making everyone satisfied," and "doing whatever they want to do." This is to allow all traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders within the party to freely spread poison. Their anti-party and anti-socialist words can be freely spoken within the party. After speaking, they are not allowed to be criticized or fought against. What kind of democracy is this? This is Chiang Kai-shek's democracy, Johnson's democracy, and it is sheer bourgeois democracy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is only concrete freedom and concrete democracy, and there is no abstract freedom and abstract democracy. In a society of class struggle, if there is the freedom of the exploiting class to exploit the laboring people, then there is no freedom for the laboring people not to be exploited. If there is bourgeois democracy, then there is no democracy for the proletariat and the laboring people." Our party is a proletarian party, and our party's democracy must serve the interests of the proletariat and be conducive to achieving our party's struggle tasks. Our party's democracy is democracy within the proletarian party. Those bourgeois representatives and capitalist-roaders, traitors, and spies who have infiltrated the party are enemies of the proletariat. They cannot enjoy democratic rights. Not only do we not give them big democracy, but we do not even give them small democracy, not a bit. China's Khrushchev advocates "letting everyone speak, making everyone satisfied," which is to give the bourgeoisie, the capitalist-roaders within the party, traitors, and spies the "democracy" to engage in anti-party and anti-socialist activities, which is to give them a green light for their capitalist restoration activities and issue a "pass" for all ghosts and monsters to carry out counter-revolutionary revenge and conspiracies to change the sky. He is waving the banner of "democracy," but in reality, he is engaged in anti-party and anti-socialist activities.

China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "doing whatever they want to do" is even more a sheer anarchist slogan, which fundamentally denies the leadership of the party, the centralism of the party, the revolutionary discipline and authority of the proletariat, and is not only extremely absurd but also extremely reactionary.

Our party is the vanguard of the proletariat, the highest organizational form of the proletariat, and is not a "guild" or a "club." Our party has the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding ideology and has strict proletarian discipline. Comrade Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million, and it needs a unified thought, revolutionary thought, and correct thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought." Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work and the standard for every word and action of party members. Every word and action of each party member must conform to Mao Zedong Thought and must consciously accept the constraints of proletarian revolutionary discipline. No party member, regardless of how senior their status or how great their merits, can violate Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary discipline of the party, and act arbitrarily within the party. China's Khrushchev advocates the reactionary slogan of anarchism, "doing whatever they want to do," which is to promote bourgeois liberalization within the party, inciting traitors, spies, capitalist-roaders, and ghosts and monsters to oppose Chairman Mao's leadership, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. China's Khrushchev's conspiracy will never succeed.

The facts are clear. The so-called "democracy" advocated by China's Khrushchev is thoroughly bourgeois democracy, the "democracy" of the bourgeoisie to be anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. If we act according to China's Khrushchev's "democracy," the revisionist trend will freely spread within the party, anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds will grow everywhere, "and it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years, or a few dozen years, it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration, and the Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the entire China will change color."

Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle of our party, the unity of centralism and democracy, discipline and freedom. According to the principle of democratic centralism, the party must implement both high democracy and high centralism. China's Khrushchev tramples on the party's democratic centralism, implementing personal dictatorship and fascist rule within the party on the one hand, and promoting bourgeois democracy on the other. It seems contradictory, but in essence, it is completely consistent. He implements personal dictatorship to suppress the masses, stifle the revolutionary spirit and rebellious spirit of party members, and establish the hegemonic rule of the bourgeois headquarters' "one-man show"; he promotes bourgeois democracy to oppose and shake the unified leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Two kinds of goods, one conspiracy. Both are aimed at achieving the evil purpose of seizing the party and seizing power to restore capitalism.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's Khrushchev, in order to save his doomed fate, concentrated on using the above-mentioned counter-revolutionary two-handed game. After the start of the Cultural Revolution, China's Khrushchev, taking advantage of Chairman Mao not being in Beijing, openly defied Chairman Mao's instructions, using the usurped power within the party to suppress the revolutionary masses, create a white terror, encircle the revolutionary faction, and label a large number of revolutionary young people who dared to rebel against the bourgeois headquarters as "counter-revolutionaries," attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the masses. At that time, he was entirely implementing personal dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship. After his counter-revolutionary conspiracy was exposed, China's Khrushchev saw that he was about to suffer a crushing defeat, and immediately changed his tune, loudly advocating the protection of the counter-revolutionary "minority," allowing those ghosts and monsters to continue to have the freedom to be anti-party and anti-socialist. However, no matter how hard China's Khrushchev works and changes his tricks, he cannot save his inevitable doomed fate. The revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have seen through all his conspiracies and exposed all his tricks. Today, the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev has been completely defeated and is in a state of total collapse.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy." This is our great program for rectifying the party. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great movement to rectify the party. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, deeply study Chairman Mao's proletarian line of building the party, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of building the party, expose and criticize his crimes of destroying the party's democratic centralism, so that our party, after this storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, can further implement Chairman Mao's proletarian line of building the party, implement the organizational principle of democratic centralism, and create a political situation within the party that is "unified in will but free in spirit, lively and vigorous, with both discipline and freedom, both unity of will and personal comfort, and both collective and individual initiative." Make our party more pure, more vigorous, and stronger, and become an invincible and indestructible fortress in the class struggle.

    坚决捍卫党的民主集中制
    ——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫破坏党的民主集中制的滔天罪行
    成都部队　红千钧
    中国共产党是伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造的伟大的马克思主义政党，是按照民主集中制的组织原则建设起来的无产阶级的先锋队。毛主席在我党创建之初，就十分重视贯彻党的民主集中制。毛主席指出：“要党有力量，依靠实行党的民主集中制去发动全党的积极性”，“民主集中主义的制度，一定要在革命斗争中显出了它的效力”。遵照毛主席的教导，在党的生活中始终不渝地贯彻党的民主集中制的原则，是保证党的团结、统一，加强党的战斗力，战胜敌人的十分重要的因素。
    国际共产主义运动的历史表明，一切机会主义者为了推行机会主义的政治路线，必然要推行一条与机会主义的政治路线相适应的组织路线，破坏党的民主集中制的原则。无产阶级政党内部马克思主义的政治路线和机会主义政治路线的斗争，总是同时伴随着执行民主集中制和破坏民主集中制的斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫是党内最大的机会主义者，是在党内推行机会主义政治路线的罪魁祸首；也是党的民主集中制的最大的破坏者。他破坏民主集中制的滔天罪行，必须彻底揭露，彻底批判。
    （一）
    毛主席教导我们：“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。”
    党的集中是以民主作基础的。是在民主的基础上，集中正确的意见，做到统一认识，统一政策，统一计划，统一指挥，统一行动。集中不能离开民主，离开民主的集中，就是个人专断，个人独裁。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的机会主义者，最害怕党的民主，唯恐党员起来造他的反，揭露他反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪恶阴谋。多年以来，他疯狂地鼓吹反动的“绝对服从”论，他用“朕即党”的架势教训党员：“是上级或中央通过决定了的，就要服从，就是不对也要服从。”他把奴隶主和奴隶的关系搬到党的生活中来，把党员看成奴隶，而他则是鸣鞭响板的奴隶主。党员必须做他的“容易驾驭”的“驯服工具”，对他的一切反党反社会主义的黑指示，都得“遵令照办”，不得稍加抵制。谁敢抵制，谁就是“否认了民主集中制的基本原则的绝对性”，就是“破坏了民主集中制”。把集中篡改为“绝对服从”，这样的所谓“民主集中制”和国民党的“训政”究竟有什么区别？这根本不是民主集中制，是地地道道的个人独裁，是国民党蒋介石的法西斯制度。
    党内要不要有服从？为了统一全党的思想、行动，使党成为有坚强的战斗力的整体，和敌人进行战斗，党内必须有服从。个人服从组织，少数服从多数，下级服从上级，全党服从中央，是党的组织原则和纪律。没有这种必要的服从，我们党就会成为一盘散沙，就不能保证全党意志和行动的统一，就会丧失战斗力。但是，这种服从必须以政治上的正确为前提，以符合毛泽东思想，符合人民利益为准则。
    毛主席教导我们：“一个政党要引导革命到胜利，必须依靠自己政治路线的正确和组织上的巩固。”“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。”危害革命的错误领导，不能代表党和人民的利益，服从这样的领导，就会导致革命的挫折和失败，就是丧失革命立场，出卖革命原则，就是对毛泽东思想的最大不忠。中国赫鲁晓夫掩盖党内两条路线的斗争，抹煞正确和错误的界线，妄图用“绝对服从”取代党的民主集中制，这是对民主集中制的最大篡改和歪曲，是绝对不能容许的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫以党的代言人自居，把自己装扮成党的意志的代表者。他一口一个“上级”，一口一个“中央”，谁敢反对他所说的“上级”和“中央”，就是“破坏了党的民主集中制”。中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“上级”，就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“中央”，就是以他为首的资产阶级司令部。他妄图将“民主集中制”作为紧箍咒，扼杀党员的革命性和革命造反精神，阻止广大党员起来和以他为首的资产阶级司令部进行斗争，这只能是枉费心机。
    反对隐藏在党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，是“破坏了民主集中制”吗？这是无耻的诽谤。中国赫鲁晓夫反对党的民主集中制的原则，采用结党营私、招降纳叛的手法，在党内拼凑起一个资产阶级司令部，从这个司令部里发出的一切黑指示，都是和毛泽东思想相对抗，都不是在民主的基础上形成的，根本代表不了广大党员的要求和意志。试问，在我们党的广大党员中，有哪一个真正忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的党员要求过“四大自由”、“三自一包”，提出过“议会道路”、“和平过渡”？中国赫鲁晓夫几十年来，想的是资本主义，说的是资本主义，干的也是资本主义。他的所作所为，没有一丝一毫是符合无产阶级利益的，没有那一件事是反映广大党员要求的。在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，广大党员起来造中国赫鲁晓夫的反，完全符合党的民主集中制的原则，他们的革命精神、朝气蓬勃的革命气概，真是好得很！好得很！
    毛主席教导我们：“政府和人民在战争中的不一致，就产生了只要集中不要民主的绝对集中主义的政府。”毛主席的教导从根本上揭露了产生个人独裁制度的阶级基础和社会基础。剥削阶级和人民利益的根本对立，使得他们极端害怕人民，不敢赋予人民以任何民主的权利，只有依靠愚民政策，依靠法西斯独裁来勉强维护他们的统治。中国赫鲁晓夫继承剥削阶级的衣钵，把奴隶和奴隶主的关系搬到党的生活中来，妄图用反动的“绝对服从”、“驯服工具”论冒充党的民主集中制，以巩固他的统治，赤裸裸地暴露了他剥削阶级的反动立场。他的这一阴谋，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，已被彻底粉碎。
    （二）
    党的民主集中制的原则规定，党不但要实行高度的民主，还要实行高度的集中。党的民主是在集中指导下的民主，发扬党的民主，目的不是要削弱党的统一集中，而正是为了加强党的统一集中。不是要削弱无产阶级的革命纪律，而是要加强无产阶级革命纪律。中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的机会主义者，他玩弄反革命的两手，一方面把党的集中篡改为个人独裁，妄图在党内建立他修正主义的统治。一方面又在党内推行资产阶级民主，实行资产阶级自由化，其目的都是为了实现篡党、篡政的阴谋。
    中国赫鲁晓夫声嘶力竭叫嚷什么“让大家讲话，使大家满意”，大家“要怎么办就怎么办”。这就是要让一切叛徒、特务、走资派，在党内可以随意放毒，他们反党、反社会主义的话，在党内可以大讲特讲。讲了以后，也不准批判，不准斗争。这是什么民主？这是蒋介石的民主，约翰逊的民主，是地地道道的资产阶级民主。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”我们党是无产阶级的政党，我们党的民主，必须服从无产阶级的利益，有利于实现我们党的斗争任务。我们党的民主是无产阶级政党内部的民主，那些钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物和走资派、叛徒、特务，他们是无产阶级的敌人，他们不能享有民主的权利，对于他们不但大民主不给，连小民主也不给，一点也不给。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“让大家讲话，使大家满意”，就是要给资产阶级、党内的走资本主义道路当权派、叛徒、特务争反党、反社会主义的“民主”，就是要为他们进行资本主义复辟活动大开“绿灯”，为一切牛鬼蛇神搞反攻倒算、阴谋变天发放“通行证”。他打的是“民主”的招牌，实际干的是反党、反社会主义的勾当。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的大家“要怎么办就怎么办”，更是地地道道的无政府主义的口号，它从根本上否定了党的领导，党的集中，党的无产阶级革命纪律和权威，不仅是极其荒谬的，而且是十分反动的。
    我们党是无产阶级的先锋队，无产阶级的最高组织形式，不是“同业工会”和“俱乐部”。我们党有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为指导思想，有严格的无产阶级纪律。林副主席指出：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针，是党员一切言论、行动的准则。每个党员的每一言论、行动，都必须符合于毛泽东思想，都必须自觉地接受无产阶级革命纪律的约束，任何党员，不管资格多老，功劳多大，都不能违背毛泽东思想，违反党的无产阶级革命纪律，在党内各行其是，任所欲为。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“要怎么办就怎么办”的无政府主义的反动口号，就是要在党内推行资产阶级自由化，煽动那些叛徒、特务、走资派和牛鬼蛇神反对毛主席的领导，反对毛泽东思想，反对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。中国赫鲁晓夫的这一阴谋是永远不能得逞的。
    事实十分清楚，中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹的所谓“民主”，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级民主，是资产阶级反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的“民主”。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的“民主”去做，修正主义的思潮就会在党内自由泛滥，反党、反社会主义的毒草就会遍地丛生，“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了”。
    （三）
    民主集中制是我们党的根本的组织原则，是集中和民主，纪律和自由的统一。按照民主集中制的原则，党既要实行高度的民主，又要实行高度的集中。中国赫鲁晓夫践踏党的民主集中制，在党内一方面搞个人独裁，搞法西斯统治，一方面又搞资产阶级民主。看起来好象是自相矛盾，但实质完全一致。他搞个人独裁，是为了镇压群众，扼杀党员群众的革命性和造反精神，建立资产阶级司令部“一言堂”的霸权统治；他搞资产阶级民主，是为了反对和动摇以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的统一领导。两样货色，一个阴谋。都是为了达到篡党篡政、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫为了挽救他行将灭亡的命运，他集中地使用了以上所说的反革命的两手。文化大革命开始以后，中国赫鲁晓夫利用毛主席不在北京，公开对抗毛主席的指示，运用窃踞的党内权力，镇压革命群众，制造白色恐怖，围剿革命派，把大批敢于起来造资产阶级司令部反的革命小将打成“反革命”，妄图扑灭群众的革命烈火，那时他搞的全是个人独裁，全是资产阶级专政。在他的反革命阴谋被识破以后，中国赫鲁晓夫眼看就要遭到灭顶之灾，他就立即转变腔调，大肆叫嚷要保护反革命的“少数”，好让那些牛鬼蛇神有继续反党反社会主义的自由。但是，不管中国赫鲁晓夫如何心劳日拙，花样翻新，都不能挽救他必然灭亡的命运。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，识破了他的一切阴谋，揭穿了他的一切花招。今天以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，已经被打得落花流水，全面崩溃。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”这是我们整党的伟大纲领。无产阶级文化大革命是一次伟大的整党运动，我们必须遵照毛主席的教导，深入学习毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，揭露和批判他破坏党的民主集中制的罪行，使我们党经过这场无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，进一步贯彻毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，贯彻民主集中制的组织原则，在党内“造成一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面”。使我们党变得更加纯洁，更加朝气蓬勃，更加坚强，成为在阶级斗争中战无不胜、无坚不摧的坚强堡垒。
