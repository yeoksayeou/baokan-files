After Kosygin's activities in India, the Soviet revisionist leadership immediately accelerated the pace of providing military "aid" to the Indian reactionary government. It has agreed to provide the Indian reactionaries with 150 SU-7 supersonic fighter-bombers. At the same time, it will also provide "aid" to the Indian reactionary government in the form of naval vessels. The Soviet revisionist group's evil activities of further arming the Indian reactionaries on a large scale have blatantly exposed its ugly face of colluding with U.S. imperialism, acting as a henchman of U.S. imperialism, and promoting neo-colonialism in Asia.

The Soviet revisionist traitor group's military "aid" to the Indian reactionaries has, of course, provoked strong reactions from India's neighboring countries, especially Pakistan. Pakistani Foreign Minister Pirzada stated: "Pakistan will continue and forever remain vigilant about its own security" and "will take any measures it deems necessary." The *Pakistan Times* sharply criticized the Soviet revisionist group for providing India with new means of aggression. The Chinese people fully support the Pakistani public opinion's righteous condemnation of the Soviet revisionist group.

The Soviet revisionist leaders defend their crimes by saying that their purpose in "aiding" India is "not to oppose certain other countries." This is sheer nonsense. Everyone knows that in recent years, the Indian reactionaries have used Soviet "aid" weapons to launch military provocations and armed invasions against socialist China multiple times, and have also launched large-scale armed attacks against Pakistan. U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist group provide the Indian reactionaries with large amounts of military "aid" to help them suppress the people internally and invade and expand externally, with the main target being China and Pakistan. The Soviet revisionist group's new military "aid" has just been provided, and Indian President Huseyn has publicly stated that the so-called threats from China and Pakistan continue to exist, creating an anti-China and anti-Pakistan atmosphere. The purpose of the Indian reactionaries in accepting Soviet military "aid" is not clear enough!

Ironclad facts once again prove that the Soviet revisionist traitor group's relentless promotion of so-called promoting Indo-Pakistan "reconciliation," and the so-called "Tashkent spirit," are all deceptive tricks. The Soviet revisionist group has always supported Indian expansionists in oppressing Pakistan. Now, it is providing large-scale military "aid" to the Indian reactionaries, supporting and inciting the Indian reactionaries to threaten and invade Pakistan. The so-called "Tashkent spirit," in essence, is just a means used by the Soviet revisionist group to prevent the Pakistani people from counterattacking Indian expansionism. The Soviet revisionist group's actions in Asia show that it is the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism, a major criminal who disrupts Asian peace, creates divisions among Asian countries, and supports and encourages aggressive wars.

It is particularly worth noting that at a time when U.S. imperialism is being beaten black and blue in the Vietnam War, facing internal and external difficulties, and unable to spare any attention, the Soviet revisionist group comes out to provide large-scale military "aid" to the Indian reactionaries. It has become the largest military "aid" supplier to the Indian reactionaries. This is doing a great favor for U.S. imperialism and fully meets the needs of U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy. The Soviet revisionist group, through providing large amounts of military "aid" to the Indian reactionaries, further controls India, making the Indian reactionaries firmly act as U.S.-Soviet imperialism's aggressive pawns and anti-China tools in Asia.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The counter-revolutionary cause of imperialism and reactionaries, although done every day, is always full of righteousness and morality in words, or at least somewhat righteous and moral, and never tells the truth." The Soviet revisionist traitor group is exactly like this. It says all the good things in its mouth, but does all the bad things in reality. It seems to be a human being on the surface, but it is actually a devil. The Soviet revisionist group, this henchman of U.S. imperialism, is hypocritical and two-faced. It is a cunning enemy of the Pakistani people, the Indian people, and the people of various countries in Asia, and a cunning enemy of the revolutionary people of the whole world.

The eyes of the people of various countries in Asia are bright, and the eyes of the revolutionary people of the world are bright. To oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism. This is the common battle slogan of the revolutionary people of Asia and the world. Whether it is U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist group, or the Indian reactionaries, they all go against the tide and will eventually be smashed to pieces by the great revolutionary storm of the Asian people!

    苏修集团是亚洲人民的阴险敌人
    本报评论员
    在柯西金到印度活动以后，苏修领导集团立即加速了对印度反动政府提供军事“援助”的步伐。它已同意向印度反动派提供一百五十架SU—7型超音速战斗轰炸机。同时，它还将向印度反动政府提供海军舰只的
  “援助”。苏修集团进一步大规模武装印度反动派的罪恶活动，赤裸裸地暴露了它加紧同美帝勾结，充当美帝帮凶，在亚洲推行新殖民主义的丑恶嘴脸。
    苏修叛徒集团对印度反动派的军事“援助”，理所当然地引起了印度的邻国，特别是巴基斯坦的强烈的反应，巴基斯坦外长皮尔扎达表示：“巴基斯坦将继续并永远对自己的安全保持警惕”，并“将采取它认为必要的任何措施。”《巴基斯坦时报》尖锐地指责苏修集团向印度提供新的侵略手段。中国人民完全支持巴基斯坦舆论界对苏修集团的这一严正的谴责。
    苏修头目们为自己的这种罪行辩解说，他们“援”印的目的“并不在于反对某些其它国家”。这是十足的鬼话。谁都知道，近几年来，印度反动派曾经使用苏“援”武器对社会主义中国多次发动军事挑衅和武装侵略，并且对巴基斯坦发动过大规模的武装进攻。美帝国主义和苏修集团给印度反动派以大量的军事“援助”，目的是帮助它对内镇压人民，对外向邻国进行侵略和扩张，矛头主要是指向中国和巴基斯坦。苏修集团新的军“援”刚刚出手，印度总统侯赛因就公开发出了所谓来自中国和巴基斯坦的威胁继续存在的滥调，制造反华和敌视巴基斯坦的空气。印度反动派接受苏修军“援”的目的，不是昭然若揭吗！
    铁的事实再一次证明，苏修叛徒集团所拚命鼓吹的什么要促使印巴“和解”，什么“塔什干精神”，通通都是骗人的鬼把戏。苏修集团一直是支持印度扩张主义者欺压巴基斯坦的。现在，它又对印度反动派提供大规模军“援”，支持和怂恿印度反动派威胁、侵略巴基斯坦。所谓“塔什干精神”，说穿了，不过是苏修集团用来阻止巴基斯坦人民反击印度扩张主义的一种手段。苏修集团在亚洲的所作所为表明，它是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是破坏亚洲和平、制造亚洲国家分裂，支持和鼓励侵略战争的一个大罪犯。
    尤其需要指出的是，目前正当美帝国主义在侵越战争中被打得焦头烂额，处于内外交困、无力他顾的时候，苏修集团出来对印度反动派进行大规模的军事“援助”，它已经成为印度反动派最大的军“援”供应者。这是帮了美帝国主义的大忙，是完全符合美帝国主义反革命全球战略的需要的。苏修集团通过对印度反动派提供大量军事“援助”，来进一步控制印度，使印度反动派死心塌地充当美苏在亚洲的侵略走卒和反华工具。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：帝国主义和反动派的“反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话”。苏修叛徒集团正是这样，它嘴巴里好话说尽，实际上坏事做绝，表面上似乎是人，实际上是个恶鬼。苏修集团这个美帝国主义的帮凶，假仁假义，两面三刀，是巴基斯坦人民、印度人民和亚洲各国人民的阴险的敌人，是全世界革命人民的阴险的敌人。
    亚洲各国人民的眼睛是雪亮的，世界革命人民的眼睛是雪亮的。反帝必须反修，这是亚洲和全世界革命人民的共同的战斗口号。不管是美帝国主义、苏修集团还是印度反动派，它们逆潮流而动，到头来都将被亚洲人民伟大的革命风暴击得粉碎！
