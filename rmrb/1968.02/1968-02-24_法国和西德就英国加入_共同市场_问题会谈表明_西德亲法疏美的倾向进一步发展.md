According to a report from the New China News Agency in Paris, French President Charles de Gaulle and West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger held talks in Paris on the 15th and 16th. The results of the talks indicate that as the U.S. imperialists become more mired in the quagmire of the Vietnam War, their control over Western Europe is increasingly weakened. The West German ruling class's tendency to align with France and distance themselves from the United States has further developed.

The main topic of this round of talks was how to handle Britain's application to join the "Common Market." After the talks, France and West Germany reached an "agreement" on this issue. This "agreement" shows that the West German government, in a matter that has already caused sharp contradictions among Western European countries, has aligned itself with France. In essence, it has accepted France's position: not to allow Britain to join the "Common Market" unless Britain, in the future, undergoes sufficient "evolution" according to the conditions set by the "Common Market" countries. Before that, only some "arrangements" on trade issues can be made between Britain and the six "Common Market" countries. In other words, Britain can only obtain a "quasi-member" status for now, and negotiations on joining cannot be conducted with Britain before the six countries reach a consensus. On the other hand, France also made some concessions, agreeing to discuss this issue at the regular meeting of the six "Common Market" foreign ministers on February 29th, and allowing the West German government to propose a plan for trade "arrangements" between the six countries and Britain.

This "agreement" reached by France and West Germany, the two main members of the "Common Market," has foiled Britain's attempt to rally West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to force France to agree to its joining the "Common Market."

In the issue of Britain joining the "Common Market," the West German government's alignment with France this time actually reflects the further weakening of U.S. imperialism and its junior partner Britain's influence within the imperialist camp. The United States has consistently supported Britain's attempt to join the "Common Market" to counter France, in order to maintain its control over Western Europe. France, on the other hand, has been trying to rally other "Common Market" countries to oppose Britain's participation, so as to prevent Britain from acting as an American spy within the "Common Market" and disrupting France's plan to control Western Europe in the struggle for hegemony between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Now, the U.S. imperialists, under the fierce blows of the heroic Vietnamese people, are showing a pathetic and embarrassed appearance. The West German government, which has always played a balancing act between the U.S. and France, naturally does not want to completely serve the U.S. and Britain in the issue of Britain joining the "Common Market," and fall out with France, causing the "Common Market" to collapse. This time, West Germany and France reached an "agreement" on this issue, which is undoubtedly a blow to the United States and its junior partner Britain, who have been trying to exploit the contradictions between West Germany and France to create an opening for Britain to join the "Common Market."

    法国和西德就英国加入“共同市场”问题会谈表明
    西德亲法疏美的倾向进一步发展
    据新华社巴黎电  法国总统戴高乐和西德总理基辛格十五日和十六日在巴黎举行了会谈。会谈的结果表明，随着美帝在侵越战争泥潭中越陷越深，美帝国主义对西欧的控制日益削弱，西德统治集团靠拢法国疏远美国的倾向有进一步发展。
    这次会谈的主要议题是如何处理英国申请加入“共同市场”的问题。会谈后法国和西德就此达成的“协议”表明，西德政府在这个已经引起了西欧国家之间尖锐矛盾的问题上，已经向法国靠拢，实际上接受了法国如下的立场：不让英国加入“共同市场”，除非英国将来按照“共同市场”国家提出的条件，有了足够的“演变”；在这以前，只能同意在英国和“共同市场”六国之间就贸易问题作出某种“安排”。换句话说，英国目前只能获得一种“准成员国”地位，在六国取得一致意见以前，不同英国谈判加入问题。另一方面，法国也作了一些让步，同意在二月二十九日“共同市场”六国外长例会上讨论这一问题，并由西德政府提出一个关于六国和英国之间贸易“安排”的方案。
    法国和西德这两个“共同市场”中的主要成员国所达成的这一“协议”，使英国企图极力拉拢西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡，迫使法国同意让它加入“共同市场”的打算落了空。
    西德基辛格政府这次在英国加入“共同市场”问题上向法国靠拢，实际上反映了美帝国主义及其小伙计英国在帝国主义阵营中的影响的进一步削弱。美国一直支持英国挤入“共同市场”，来对付法国，以便美国保持对西欧的控制；而法国则竭力拉拢“共同市场”的其他国家反对英国参加，免得英国在“共同市场”内充当美国的奸细，破坏法国控制西欧与美、苏争霸的计划。现在，美帝在英雄的越南人民狠狠打击下，现出一副纸老虎的狼狈相，处境分外尴尬。一贯在美法之间玩弄平衡的西德政府，自然不愿意在英国参加“共同市场”问题上完全为美、英效劳，同法国闹翻，把“共同市场”搞垮。这次西德和法国就这一问题达成“协议”，对一直企图利用西德同法国之间的矛盾，为英国挤入“共同市场”打开缺口的美国以及它的小伙计英国，无疑是个打击。
