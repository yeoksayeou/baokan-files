The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The basic task of the Party's political work in the countryside is to constantly instill socialist ideology in the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, the Chinese Khrushchev, does the opposite, forcefully injecting bourgeois ideology into our minds. During China's three years of temporary difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev, to cater to the needs of domestic and foreign reactionaries, vigorously promoted the "three frees and one contract" junk, attempting to restore capitalism.

A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party in Tianjin, following their master's orders, brought the "three frees and one contract" to our brigade for trial, implementing "contract production to households" and "contract labor to individuals" tricks, establishing "husband-wife teams" and "father-son teams," with each family "contracting labor and production." This delighted the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, harming the state, the collective, and the poor and lower-middle peasants. Take my family as an example: my wife is in poor health and cannot work, and we have five children, with only me as the labor force. During the busy farming season, the contracted land is too much to handle, sometimes working until my head aches and my eyes blur. My family is just one among the millions of poor and lower-middle peasants. If this trend continues, the consequences will be unbearable! The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists see us crying in desperation but laugh on the sidelines. Some rich peasants even mimic the Chinese Khrushchev's tone, saying: "The poor are destined to suffer, no matter when, crying until their eyes are blind is useless." Look! The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are of the same ilk as the Chinese Khrushchev. They sit on the same bench, wear the same pants, breathe through the same nostril, and their actions are exactly the same.

The Chinese Khrushchev, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, spoke the words in the hearts of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and did what they wanted to do but dared not. He desperately praised the landlords and rich peasants, using every trick to revive the exploitative system that devours people. He thinks of restoring capitalism and uses every means to do so. Even his five internal organs are permeated with capitalist germs.

Through the "Four Cleanups" movement, we curbed the evil wind of "three frees and one contract," consolidated the collective economy, and significantly improved everyone's ideology. Agricultural production has been bountiful for consecutive years. Last year, the rice yield per mu was over 980 jin. In the past four years, our brigade has stored over 500,000 jin of grain, bought seven carts, and built over 70 new houses. Practice has proven: the collective economy of the people's commune is our lifeline. We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao and march forward forever.

### “三自一包”可把俺贫下中农害苦了

    “三自一包”可把俺贫下中农害苦了
    西右营大队副队长　董玉山
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：党在农村的“政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向。”而党内最大的走资派中国赫鲁晓夫却反其道而行之，极力往我们头脑里灌输资产阶级思想。在我国三年暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫为了迎合国内外狐群狗党的需要，极力鼓吹“三自一包”这个破烂货，妄图复辟资本主义。
    天津市的党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，秉承其主子旨意，把“三自一包”拿到俺大队来试点，搞什么“包产到户”“包工到人”的鬼圈套，成立了什么“夫妻班”“父子班”，一家一户“包工包产”。这下可喜坏了地、富、反、坏、右分子，害了国家，害了集体，害了贫下中农。就拿我家说吧，俺家七口人，我爱人身体不好，不能劳动，还有五个孩子，只有我一个劳力，一到农忙季节分包的地就种不过来，有时累得头疼眼花。俺家只是千千万万贫下中农中间的一个，这样发展下去后果真是不堪设想！地、富、反、坏、右分子看到我们急得哭，却在一旁看笑话。有的富农还学着中国赫鲁晓夫的腔调说：“穷人就是这个命，到什么时候也好不了，哭瞎了眼也没用。”看！地、富、反、坏、右分子和中国赫鲁晓夫是一类货。他们坐着一条板凳，穿一条连裆裤，一个鼻孔出气，他们的言行真是一模一样。
    中国赫鲁晓夫站在资产阶级的反动立场上，说出了地、富、反、坏、右分子的心里话，做出了地、富、反、坏、右分子想做而不敢做的事。他拚命地往地主、富农脸上贴金，费尽心机地为吃人不吐骨头的剥削制度招魂。他想的是资本主义复辟，千方百计搞的也是资本主义复辟，就连他的五脏六腑，都渗透着资本主义的毒菌。
    通过“四清”运动，我们煞住了“三自一包”的妖风，巩固了集体经济，人人思想大大提高，农业生产获得连年丰收。去年水稻亩产九百八十多斤。四年来，我们大队存了粮食五十多万斤，买了七辆大车，盖起了七十多间新房。实践证明：人民公社集体经济是我们的命根子。我们贫下中农要沿着毛主席指引的社会主义康庄大道胜利前进，永远前进。
