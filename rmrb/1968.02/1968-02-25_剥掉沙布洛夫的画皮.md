The great victory of the Battle of Stalingrad shines with the glory of proletarian revolutionary heroism.

The notorious Soviet revisionist literary figure Simonov, in 1943, produced the reactionary novel "Days and Nights" based on the Battle of Stalingrad. After the novel was published, it was praised by Soviet revisionist writers, who said, "The protagonist Shaburov is a typical Soviet soldier." Chinese revisionist writers also elevated this protagonist to the heavens, saying, "The intelligent and brave Shaburov is a familiar hero to Chinese youth." And so on.

Is Shaburov really such a remarkable "hero"? No! No! Absolutely not! Shaburov's five internal organs are filled with the filthiest things. He is a thoroughbred bourgeois individualist, a disgrace to the Red Army!

Shaburov is a coward. He casts aside the future of his country and the fate of humanity, and first and foremost cares about his own life. On the way to Stalingrad, Shaburov thought, "If the enemy occupies Stalingrad, he will die. If he does not let the city fall, he might survive." Is he determined to die with Stalingrad? Absolutely not! He reluctantly goes to battle, just to have a chance to survive! Shaburov "knows that he must not die." When the battle is at its fiercest, he "has an unprecedented desire to survive," and when victory is near, his "every move" shows that he "wants to live." Before attacking three buildings, Shaburov thought: "Death is still a bit scary." When his comrade suggested he inspect the front line at dawn, he said: "My life is important." In short, survival is the most important thing!

Shaburov is an ambitious climber. Look at what he said to the battalion chief of staff Maslennikov: "The longer the war lasts, the more valuable those who have participated in it from beginning to end will be. If I, Shaburov, become a battalion commander in the future, you will also become a company commander..." This "hero" not only dreams of promotion himself but also promises promotions to his subordinates!

Shaburov is also a lecher. On the front lines of the war, he fell in love with the nurse Anna at first sight, talked about love, and even wanted to hold a wedding in the trenches. After being injured, he hid in Anna's house to talk about love, living a "honeymoon" life, and shamelessly said: "I am very happy, very, very happy."

Shaburov has a saying that clearly reveals his fundamental philosophy: "Oh, life in the world, no matter how much one has, it is always too little." What he believes in is nothing more than the philosophy of "if you don't seek benefits for yourself, you will be punished by heaven and earth." What he pursues is nothing more than a lowly and vulgar life. What kind of hero is this?

A true proletarian revolutionary hero should be a person who "does not seek personal gain and only seeks to benefit others," should be "a person of high moral character, a person of purity, a person of virtue, a person who is above vulgar interests, a person who benefits the people."

In the great Soviet Patriotic War, heroes like Matrosov emerged, and they are the shining examples of the Soviet people. They will forever live in the hearts of the Soviet people. While the so-called "hero" Shaburov created by Simonov deserves to be drowned in the spit of revolutionary people!

    剥掉沙布洛夫的画皮
    解放军某部副团长前中国人民志愿军
    特等功臣、二级战斗英雄  徐恒禄
    伟大的斯大林格勒保卫战的胜利，闪耀着无产阶级革命英雄主义的光辉。
    臭名昭著的苏修文艺头目西蒙诺夫，在一九四三年抛出了以斯大林格勒保卫战为题材的反动小说《日日夜夜》。小说出笼以后，博得了苏联修正主义文人的喝采，说什么：“书中的主人公沙布洛夫是苏维埃战士的典型”；中国的修正主义文人，也把这个主人公捧到了九天之上，说什么：“智勇双全的沙布洛夫是中国青年熟悉的英雄。”如此等等。
    沙布洛夫果真是一个了不起的“英雄”吗？不是！不是！绝对不是！沙布洛夫的五脏六腑充满了最肮脏的东西。他是一个地地道道的资产阶级个人主义者，是苏联红军可耻的败类！
    沙布洛夫是怕死鬼。他把祖国前途和人类命运丢到九霄云外，首先关心的是自己的狗命。在去斯大林格勒的路上，沙布洛夫想，“假定德寇占领了斯大林格勒，那他就会死去，若是他不让该城失守，他也许可以从此获生。”他是誓死与斯大林格勒共存亡吗？决不是！他无可奈何地去作战，为的是能够侥幸活下来！沙布洛夫“只知道是死不得的”。当战斗最激烈的时候，他“产生了从来没有过的顽强的求生欲望”，当接近胜利的时候，他的“一举一动”都表明他“愿意活着”。在攻打三座楼房之前，沙布洛夫想：“死总还是有点怕的”。当他的战友建议他天亮后再去巡视阵地时，他说：“那我的命要紧”。总之，活命最要紧！
    沙布洛夫是升官迷。请看他对营参谋长马斯林尼可夫说的话吧：“战争愈持久下去，则那些自始至终参加了这战争的人员将愈可宝贵，如果我沙布洛夫日后当了团长，你也就会当营长……。”这个“英雄”不但自己做着升官的美梦，还对自己的下级封官许愿呢！
    沙布洛夫又是色情狂。他在战火纷飞的前线，跟女医护人员安娘一见钟情，大谈恋爱，还要在战壕里举行婚礼。负伤后，就躲在安娘家里谈情说爱，过“蜜梦”般的生活，还不知羞耻地说：“我非常幸福，非常，非常幸福”。
    沙布洛夫有一句话，明明白白地道出了他做人的根本：“天呵，人生在世，纵然他有过的再多，也总嫌太少”。他所信奉的无非就是“人不为己，天诛地灭”的市侩哲学，他所追求的，无非就是低级下流的庸俗生活。这是什么英雄？
    真正的无产阶级革命英雄，应当是一个“毫不利己专门利人”的人，应当是“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”
    在伟大的苏联卫国战争中，出现了象马特洛索夫那样的英雄，他们才是苏维埃人民的光辉榜样，他们将永远活在苏联人民的心里。而西蒙诺夫笔下的所谓“英雄”沙布洛夫，只配淹死在革命人民的唾沫中！
