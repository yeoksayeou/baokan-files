The east wind brings frequent good news, and amidst the sound of victories, we welcome the New Year.

The heroic armed forces of the people of South Vietnam launched a powerful offensive during the Spring Festival, achieving brilliant results. In Saigon, the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam simultaneously attacked the U.S. "Embassy," the "Presidential Palace," the military headquarters, the police station, and a series of U.S. and puppet bases and camps. They destroyed the Saigon radio station and occupied several floors of the "Embassy" building for six hours, plunging the enemy in the city into chaos. In various parts of South Vietnam, they simultaneously launched attacks on Da Nang, Phu Bai, Hue, Quang Tri, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, and Pleiku, defeating the enemy and causing heavy casualties. The people of South Vietnam have fought well and fought beautifully! This is a great victory in the people of South Vietnam's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. The Chinese people enthusiastically hail the New Spring victory of the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam and extend warm congratulations to our heroic brothers in South Vietnam!

To salvage the failing situation in the Vietnam War, U.S. imperialism is escalating its military adventurism in South Vietnam and conducting massive bombing raids on North Vietnam. The offensive launched by the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam during the Spring Festival is a severe punishment to the U.S. aggressors who are escalating the war of aggression and brutally slaughtering the Vietnamese people. It once again demonstrates the might of the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam!

The New Spring victory of the people of South Vietnam is a vivid portrayal of the excellent situation in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. After severely defeating the U.S. aggressors during the rainy season last year, the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam have been launching offensive operations in the dry season, making the U.S. aggressors struggle to cope. This time, during the Spring Festival, the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam launched a full-scale offensive, simultaneously annihilating a large number of the enemy's forces in a series of cities, bases, and strongholds occupied by the U.S. and puppet forces. They can fight whenever and wherever they want, and can even strike at the lairs of the U.S. aggressors and their puppets. This powerfully shows that the people of South Vietnam have firmly grasped the initiative in the war. The masters of the battlefield in South Vietnam are not the ferocious U.S. aggressors, but the people of South Vietnam who are fighting more bravely and becoming stronger with each battle.

The Johnson administration hopes to salvage its failure by continuously increasing troops in South Vietnam. Currently, there are nearly 500,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam. However, the U.S. aggressors, holed up in major cities and strongholds, cannot escape being attacked. Even within Saigon, the lair of the U.S. aggressors, the U.S. "Embassy," is frequently subjected to surprise attacks by the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam. The flying generals descend from the heavens. The armed forces of the people of South Vietnam are truly like heavenly soldiers. This time, the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam attacked and temporarily occupied the U.S. "Embassy," fully demonstrating that in today's South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors are completely surrounded by the people of South Vietnam, and their very existence is no longer safe. Their days in South Vietnam will not be long.

The New Spring victory of the people of South Vietnam has caused great alarm in Washington. Johnson is sleepless and holds emergency meetings in the middle of the night to discuss countermeasures. People remember that not long ago, this U.S. president boasted about the situation in Vietnam in his State of the Union address, claiming that the U.S. had "power" and that the people of South Vietnam had been defeated in "battle after battle" over the past year. Facing today's harsh reality, Johnson's lies can only become a laughing stock for the whole world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out during the third phase of the Chinese domestic revolutionary war: "The enemy always underestimates the initiative of our army and overestimates their own strength, although they are also like startled birds."

U.S. imperialism is the same in the Vietnam War. Although it has become a startled bird under the heavy blows of the people of South Vietnam, it still overestimates its own strength. Currently, U.S. imperialism not only continues to increase troops in South Vietnam and intensify bombing raids on North Vietnam but also actively plots to spread the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula. With the close collaboration of the traitorous Soviet revisionist clique, it attempts to find a way out through further escalating the war and various plots of deception and coercion to force surrender.

However, all the desperate struggles of the U.S. aggressors are in vain. The Vietnamese people's iron will to carry the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation to the end is unshakable. They are determined to fight a protracted war and continue fighting until the last U.S. aggressor is driven out of Vietnam. The final and complete victory will surely belong to the great, brave, and tenacious Vietnamese people who persist in fighting!

### 欢呼南越人民新春大捷

    欢呼南越人民新春大捷
    东风频传喜讯来，捷报声中度新春。
    英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量，春节期间在南越战场上全面出击，发动了强大的攻势，取得了辉煌的战果。在西贡，南越人民解放武装力量同时袭击了美国“大使馆”、伪“总统府”、伪军总部、伪警察局和一系列美伪基地、兵营，摧毁了西贡广播电台，并且占领了“大使馆”大楼的好几层达六小时之久，使盘踞在这个城市的敌人陷于一片混乱之中。在南越各地，他们同时向岘港、芙拜、顺化、广治、归仁、芽庄、波来古等地发动进攻，把敌人打得落花流水，魂飞胆裂，伤亡惨重。南越人民打得好！打得漂亮！这是南越人民抗美救国战争的一次伟大胜利。中国人民为南越人民解放武装力量新春大捷而热烈欢呼，并且向英雄的越南南方兄弟表示热烈祝贺！
    美帝国主义为了挽救侵越战争的败局，正在越南南方加紧扩大军事冒险，对越南北方大肆狂轰滥炸。南越人民解放武装力量这次春节的胜利出击，正是对加紧扩大侵略战争、野蛮屠杀越南人民的美国强盗的一个严厉的惩罚，又一次显示了南越人民解放武装力量的神威！
    南越人民的新春大捷，是越南人民抗美救国战争形势大好的一个生动写照。南越人民解放武装力量，在去年雨季狠狠打击美国强盗以后，旱季以来又接连主动出击，打得美国强盗顾此失彼，穷于应付。这一次春节期间，南越人民解放武装力量全面出击，同时在美伪占领的一系列城镇、基地和据点大量歼灭敌人的有生力量。他们要在什么时候打，就能够在什么时候打；要在什么地方打，就能够在什么地方打，并且能够直捣美国侵略者及其走狗的巢穴。这就有力地表明，南越人民已经牢牢地掌握着战争的主动权。主宰南越战场的，不是穷凶极恶的美国侵略者，而是越战越勇、越战越强的南越人民。
    约翰逊政府指望不断向南越增兵来挽救它的失败。目前侵越美军已近五十万人。但是，美国侵略者龟缩在一些主要城市和据点里，仍然逃不脱挨打的命运。即使是在西贡市内的美国侵略者的巢穴美国“大使馆”，也经常遭到南越人民武装的奇袭。飞将军自重霄入。南越人民解放武装力量真是象天兵天将一样。这一次，南越人民解放武装力量袭击并曾一度占领了美国“大使馆”，这充分说明，在今天的南越，美国侵略者已经完全处于南越人民的重重包围之中，连存身之地也难以保证安全了。他们赖在南越的日子已经不会很长了。
    对于南越人民的新春大捷，华盛顿大感惊慌。约翰逊眠不安枕，急得半夜起床开会研究对策。人们记得，就在不久前，这个美国总统在国情咨文里谈到越南局势时还大肆吹嘘美国的“力量”，胡说什么南越人民过去的一年中“在一个又一个战役中被击败”。面对着今天严酷的现实，约翰逊的这种谎言，只能成为全世界的笑柄。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在中国第三次国内革命战争时期曾经指出：“敌人对于我军的积极性总是估计不足的，对于自己力量总是估计过高，虽然他们同时又是惊弓之鸟。”
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中也是如此。它在南越人民的沉重打击下虽然已经成了惊弓之鸟，但是却依旧过高地估计了自己的力量。目前，美帝国主义不仅继续向南越增兵和加剧对越南北方的轰炸，而且积极策划把战火烧到整个印度支那。它在苏修叛徒集团的紧密配合下，妄想通过进一步扩大战争以及诱和迫降的种种阴谋，来为自己寻找一条出路。
    但是，美国侵略者的一切疯狂挣扎，都是徒劳的。英雄的越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底的钢铁意志是不可动摇的。他们决心持久作战，长期地打下去，一直打到美国侵略者一个不剩地被赶出越南为止。最后的、彻底的胜利，一定属于英勇顽强、坚持战斗的伟大的越南人民！
