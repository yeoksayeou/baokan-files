The spokesperson of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China issued a statement today, strongly protesting the Myanmar government's unreasonable arrest and sentencing of three groups of patriotic overseas Chinese. The spokesperson solemnly warns the Myanmar government: It must immediately stop the unreasonable persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese and immediately release all those who have been unreasonably arrested. The spokesperson pointed out that if the Myanmar government, disregarding the serious protests and legitimate demands of the Chinese government, persists in its anti-China and anti-Chinese stance, it will inevitably meet with the same thorough failure as all other anti-China "heroes."

The full text of the statement by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission spokesperson is as follows:

On February 20, the Myanmar government fabricated charges and sentenced eleven innocent detained overseas Chinese, including Chen Bofu, to ten years in prison. Prior to this, six patriotic overseas Chinese, including Zhao Runqi, and eight overseas Chinese students and youths, including Yang Derong, were unreasonably arrested by the Myanmar government, falsely accused, and sentenced to prison. The so-called "trial" and "verdict" by the Myanmar government against these three groups of unjustly detained overseas Chinese have become increasingly severe. This fully exposes the Myanmar government's stubborn stance of intensifying the persecution of overseas Chinese, further worsening Sino-Myanmar relations, and deliberately making an enemy of the Chinese people. We strongly condemn and protest this.

In June 1967, the Myanmar government, in line with the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, carried out a series of atrocities, including attacking the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar, killing Chinese experts assisting Myanmar, injuring Chinese diplomatic couriers, and slaughtering and arresting a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese, as well as burning and looting the property of overseas Chinese. The Chinese government has repeatedly demanded that the Myanmar government stop its anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities, severely punish the murderers and fascist thugs, and immediately release all illegally detained overseas Chinese. However, up to now, the Myanmar government has not only failed to release the innocent detained overseas Chinese but has also subjected them to unreasonable trials; not only has it failed to arrest a single murderer or thug but has openly protected them, and even released the culprit who injured the Chinese diplomatic courier after he was captured by Chinese Embassy staff and handed over to the Myanmar government. Now, the anti-China and anti-Chinese thugs and murderers are at large, while the persecuted overseas Chinese have become "criminals." The Myanmar government's heinous actions cannot but arouse the extreme indignation of the Chinese people and the broad masses of overseas Chinese. We strongly demand that the Myanmar government immediately stop the unreasonable persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese and immediately and unconditionally release all those who have been unreasonably arrested.

During the "trial" of patriotic overseas Chinese, the Myanmar government shouted about pursuing the so-called "causes" of the June Rangoon incident and slapped patriotic overseas Chinese with charges of "creating disturbances" and "disturbing the public." It is well known that the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Myanmar have always followed the teachings of the Chinese government, respected the customs and habits of the Myanmar people, respected local laws, and lived in friendship with the Myanmar people. They have actively supported the Myanmar people's struggle against imperialism and colonialist aggression and have also made some contributions to the development of Myanmar's economy and culture. These facts cannot be erased by the Myanmar government's slander and defamation. The broad masses of overseas Chinese have an unlimited love for the great socialist motherland and an unlimited love for the red sun in the hearts of millions of overseas Chinese, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. This is their sacred and inviolable right. In order to curry favor with the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists, to suppress the people at home, and to divert the strong discontent of the people at home with their reactionary rule, the Myanmar government actually carried out the shocking anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities at the end of June last year. This is the true cause of the June Rangoon incident. The culprits of this incident are none other than the Myanmar government. It was the Myanmar government that directed the murderers and thugs to brutally persecute overseas Chinese, "create disturbances," and "disturb the public." Those who should be tried are precisely these fascist elements, not the innocent patriotic overseas Chinese.

The Myanmar government's unreasonable trial of patriotic overseas Chinese is a new trick in its anti-China and anti-Chinese plot, attempting to deceive the Myanmar people and world public opinion, wash away its anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes, and shift the blame for worsening Sino-Myanmar relations onto the Chinese side and the overseas Chinese. The Myanmar government thinks it has succeeded, but this is nothing more than a very clumsy farce and will inevitably backfire.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people are deeply concerned about the overseas Chinese who have been harmed in Myanmar. The patriotic overseas Chinese in Myanmar, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have bravely struggled and remained unyielding under the brutal persecution of the Myanmar government, in prisons, and in courtrooms, exposing and denouncing the Myanmar government's anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes of worsening Sino-Myanmar relations and destroying the friendship between the two peoples. They are just and fearless, truly the good sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and truly the good overseas Chinese of the great socialist motherland. We extend our warm greetings to them. The struggle of the patriotic overseas Chinese in Myanmar is not isolated; they have the support of the broad masses of the Myanmar people, the support of the 700 million people of the motherland, and the support of the people of all countries in the world. We are firmly convinced that the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese will strive even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen unity with the Myanmar people, and resolutely carry the struggle against persecution to the end until they achieve final victory.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To disrupt, to fail, to disrupt again, to fail again, until they are utterly destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when they deal with the people's cause. They will not be able to escape this logic." In recent years, a small handful of anti-communist and anti-China "heroes," with the support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, have one by one come out to perform, and the more they perform, the more miserable their failures. History is so ruthless. We solemnly warn the Myanmar government: If you disregard the serious protests and legitimate demands of the Chinese government and persist in your anti-China and anti-Chinese stance, you will inevitably meet with thorough failure.

    我侨委发言人强烈抗议缅政府无理迫害爱国华侨
    缅甸政府坚持反华排华必将自食恶果
    新华社二十五日讯中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会发言人今天发表谈话，对缅甸政府无理逮捕并判处三批爱国华侨提出强烈抗议。发言人严正警告缅甸政府：必须立即停止对爱国华侨的无理迫害，立即释放一切被无理逮捕的爱国华侨。发言人指出，如果缅甸政府不顾中国政府的严重抗议和正当要求，一意孤行，坚持反华排华，就必然要和其他一切反华的“英雄好汉”一样，以彻底的失败而告终。
    华侨事务委员会发言人谈话的全文如下：
    二月二十日，缅甸政府对无辜被捕的陈伯甫等十一名爱国华侨，捏造罪名，判处十年徒刑。在这之前，爱国华侨赵润畦等六人，爱国华侨学生和青年杨德荣等八人，被缅甸政府无理逮捕，妄加罪名，判处徒刑。缅甸政府对这三批无辜被捕的华侨进行的所谓“审讯”和作出的所谓“判决”，一次比一次严重。这充分暴露了缅甸政府加紧迫害华侨，进一步恶化中缅两国关系，蓄意与中国人民为敌的顽固立场。我们对此予以严厉的谴责，并提出强烈的抗议。
    一九六七年六月，缅甸政府迎合美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的需要，制造了袭击中国驻缅甸大使馆，杀死中国援缅专家，刺伤中国外交信使，屠杀和逮捕大批爱国华侨，焚烧和抢劫华侨财产等一系列暴行。中国政府曾多次要求缅甸政府停止反华排华暴行，严惩杀人凶手和法西斯暴徒，立即释放所有被非法逮捕的华侨。但是，直到如今，缅甸政府不仅没有释放无辜被捕的华侨，反而对他们进行无理的审判；不仅没有逮捕一个凶手和暴徒，反而公然庇护他们，甚至连刺伤中国外交信使的凶手，被中国大使馆工作人员当场捕获交给缅甸政府后，也竟然被释放。现在，反华排华的暴徒和杀人凶手逍遥法外，遭受迫害的华侨却成了“罪犯”。缅甸政府这种倒行逆施的罪恶行径，不能不激起中国人民和广大华侨的无比愤慨。我们强烈要求缅甸政府立即停止对爱国华侨的无理迫害，立即无条件释放一切被无理逮捕的爱国华侨。
    缅甸政府在“审讯”爱国华侨时，叫嚷要追究所谓六月仰光事件的“起因”，并给爱国华侨加上“制造骚乱”、“惊扰群众”等罪名。众所周知，在缅甸的广大华侨一贯按照中国政府的教导，尊重缅甸人民的风俗习惯，尊重当地的法律，同缅甸人民友好相处，积极支持缅甸人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义侵略的斗争，对发展缅甸的经济和文化事业也作出了一定的贡献。这些事实，是缅甸政府的诬蔑和诽谤所抹煞不了的。广大华侨无限热爱伟大的社会主义祖国，无限热爱千百万华侨心中最红最红的红太阳、中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，这是他们神圣不可侵犯的权利。缅甸政府为了投靠美帝和苏修，镇压国内人民，转移国内人民对他们反动统治的强烈不满，在去年六月底竟制造了骇人听闻的反华排华暴行，这就是六月仰光事件的真正的起因。这次事件的罪魁祸首不是别人，正是缅甸政府。是缅甸政府指使凶手和暴徒残酷迫害华侨，“制造骚乱”，“惊扰群众”，应该受审判的正是他们这一伙法西斯家伙，而决不是无辜的爱国华侨。
    缅甸政府无理审判爱国华侨，这是它反华排华阴谋的新花样，妄图借此欺骗缅甸人民和世界舆论，洗刷自己反华排华的罪责，把恶化中缅两国关系的罪责转嫁到中国方面和华侨身上。缅甸政府这样做，自以为得计，其实这不过是一出极其拙劣的丑剧，必将自食其恶果。
    中国政府和中国人民十分关怀在缅甸的受害侨胞。缅甸爱国华侨高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在缅甸政府的残酷迫害下，在监狱中，在法庭上，英勇斗争，顽强不屈，揭露和控诉缅甸政府恶化中缅两国关系，破坏两国人民友谊的反华排华罪行。他们正义凛然，不愧为中国人民的好儿女，不愧为伟大社会主义祖国的好侨胞。我们向他们致以亲切的慰问。缅甸爱国华侨的斗争不是孤立的，他们有缅甸广大人民的支持，有祖国七亿人民的支持，有世界各国人民的支持。我们坚信，广大爱国华侨一定会更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，加强同缅甸人民的团结，坚决把反迫害斗争进行到底，直到取得最后的胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”近几年来，一小撮反共反华的“英雄好汉”，在美帝和苏修的支持下，一个一个地跳出来表演，他们表演得越充分，就失败得越惨。历史就是这样的无情。我们严正警告缅甸政府：如果你们不顾中国政府的严重抗议和正当要求，一意孤行，坚持反华排华，也必然要以彻底的失败而告终。
