The Revolutionary Committee of Xuhui District, Shanghai, and the Xuhui District Military Training Camp recently organized a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team consisting of 280 people, including PLA soldiers, workers, families of martyrs and veterans, and neighborhood committee members. With the determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they entered 21 middle schools in Xuhui District that had not yet established revolutionary committees. This effort promoted the rapid achievement of revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and the resumption of classes for revolution in these schools.

Members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, with deep class feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, first assisted the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes upon arriving at the schools. They fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Through these study classes, they mobilized revolutionary teachers and students to combat factionalism and anarchist tendencies, consolidating the revolutionary great unity from the ideological level and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Some revolutionary youngsters said: "In the past, we were deceived by factionalism and anarchism, treating class brothers as 'enemies' and ignoring the real enemies. We can no longer engage in factionalism and anarchism, doing things that make friends sad and enemies happy." Huaguang Middle School was a unit that had long been engaged in "internal strife." After the propaganda team entered the school, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, conducting in-depth and detailed ideological and political work with the three student organizations. Finally, they reached an agreement on revolutionary great unity on February 12.

The propaganda team also focused on class education to raise the class consciousness of revolutionary teachers and students and strengthen their awareness of the enemy. Especially many retired workers and families of martyrs and veterans, with deep class feelings, compared the old and new societies to the Red Guards, achieving good results. The third class of the third year at China Middle School was originally the most fiercely engaged in "internal strife" in the entire school. After a retired worker from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team came to this class, he invited the leaders of both factions to have a heart-to-heart talk. Using his own bitter history of being a child laborer in the old society, he conducted class education for the revolutionary youngsters, promoting their revolutionary great unity. Under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the masses of both factions in this class made self-criticisms, eliminated misunderstandings, and strengthened unity.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team also brought the fine tradition of the PLA, which always pays attention to highlighting proletarian politics, to the schools. Many comrades, upon arriving at the schools, worked with revolutionary teachers and students to arrange the environment, creating a strong political atmosphere. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team that came to Shuguang Middle School arrived at the school early every morning, joining the revolutionary teachers and students to first wish Chairman Mao long life, sing "The East Is Red," recite the "Three Articles," read Chairman Mao's quotations, and do the Chairman Mao quotations exercises. Under the promotion of the propaganda team, six more middle schools in the district established revolutionary committees.

In addition to working within the schools, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team also went deep into some streets and alleys, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and propagating the great significance of resuming classes for revolution to the residents and parents of students. Many revolutionary parents expressed that they would educate their children to actively participate in the proletarian cultural revolution in the schools.

    上海徐汇区革委会、军训营组织毛泽东思想宣传队深入学校
    帮助革命师生大办学习班克服派性
    有力地促进了二十多所学校迅速实现革命大联合、革命三结合和复课闹革命
    据新华社上海电　上海市徐汇区革命委员会、徐汇区军训营最近组织了一支由解放军战士、工人、烈军属、里弄干部等二百八十多人参加的毛泽东思想宣传队，怀着落实毛主席最新指示的决心，分别进入徐汇区还没有建立革命委员会的二十一所中等学校，促进这些学校迅速实现革命的大联合、革命的三结合和复课闹革命。
    毛泽东思想宣传队的同志怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，来到学校后首先大力协助红卫兵小将和革命教工大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。通过学习班，发动革命师生围剿派性和无政府主义思潮，从思想上巩固革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合。有的革命小将说：我们以往上了派性和无政府主义的当，中了派性和无政府主义的毒，把阶级兄弟当“仇人”，把真正的敌人放在一边。我们再也不能闹派性和无政府主义，做亲者痛、仇者快的事情了。华光中学是个长期打“内战”的单位。宣传队进校后，大办毛泽东思想学习班，对三个学生组织做了深入细致的思想政治工作，终于使他们在二月十二日达成了革命大联合的协议。
    宣传队还狠抓阶级教育，提高革命师生的阶级觉悟，加强革命师生的敌情观念。特别是许多退休老工人、烈军属带着深厚的阶级感情，给红卫兵小将讲新旧社会的对比，取得了很好的效果。中国中学高三（三）班原来是全校“内战”打得最凶的一个班，毛泽东思想宣传队的一位退休老工人来到了这个班以后，把两派的头头请到一起谈心，用自己在旧社会当童工的血泪史，向革命小将进行阶级教育，促使他们实行革命大联合。在毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，这个班的两派群众各自做了自我批评，消除了隔阂，增强了团结。
    毛泽东思想宣传队还给各学校带来了解放军处处注意突出无产阶级政治的优良传统。许多同志一到学校就和革命师生一起布置环境，把学校的政治气氛搞得浓浓的。来到沪光中学的毛泽东思想宣传队，每天一早到校，和革命师生们一起首先敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，唱《东方红》，背“老三篇”，读毛主席语录，做毛主席语录操。在宣传队的推动下，全区又有六所中学成立了革命委员会。
    毛泽东思想宣传队除了在学校内开展工作外，还深入到一些街道、里弄，大办毛泽东思想学习班，向里弄居民、学生家长宣传复课闹革命的重大意义。许多革命家长都表示，要教育子女积极投入学校的无产阶级文化大革命。
