Yemenis resolutely counter U.S. imperialist subversion plot

The armed forces and people's militia of Yemen have achieved new victories in their recent battles against the armed subversion of the Yemeni republican regime, which was plotted by U.S. imperialism and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries.

In a battle in the western suburbs of the Yemeni capital Sana'a, the armed forces and people's militia of Yemen killed more than 30 mercenaries and infiltrators, wounded many more, and captured a large quantity of U.S.-made weapons and ammunition, including mortars, anti-tank rockets, light and heavy machine guns, and cannons.

200,000 metalworkers in Australia go on strike

On February 6, 200,000 metalworkers in various parts of Australia went on strike to protest the capitalists' refusal to grant them the wage increases they deserve.

At the same time, metalworkers in most major cities held mass protest meetings.

In Melbourne, 5,000 workers took to the streets in a demonstration march.

In Adelaide, about 1,000 striking workers held a demonstration march.

Danish Social Democratic government falls

In the face of intensifying contradictions within the Danish ruling clique, the Danish Social Democratic government has fallen, and a new government composed of the Radical Party, the Farmers Party, and the Conservative Party was formed on February 2.

In the new government, the leader of the Radical Party, Hilmar Baunsgaard, will serve as prime minister, the Farmers Party's Poul Hartling will serve as foreign minister, and the Conservative Party's Poul Moller will serve as finance minister.

The Danish Social Democratic government was forced to resign on December 15 last year. Its fall was the result of its following the U.S. and British imperialists, harming Danish national interests, and creating serious financial and economic difficulties at home.
