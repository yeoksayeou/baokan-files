China Medical University enrolls only sixty students each year, and the recruitment regions are strictly limited to major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Nanjing. They claim that students from these cities have "high standards," "good foundations," and are "intelligent and adaptable." What kind of recruitment policy is this? How many children of workers and peasants can enter the medical university? Just take one example: from 1959 to 1962, over four years, only 5% of the new students from Beijing were children of workers and peasants, while 5% were children of the bourgeoisie, and another 5% were children of the five black categories. These are shocking figures! From this, it is clear for whom the gates of the medical university are open.

From the day workers' and peasants' children enter the medical university, the university's capitalist roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" have never stopped persecuting and attacking them. A student (a Communist Party member) did his homework correctly, but was met with sneering suspicion. The teacher wrote insulting comments on the homework: "Did you do this yourself?" "Don't pretend to know what you don't know!" If it were a high-achieving student, a child of the bourgeoisie, even if the homework was wrong, the teacher would write a few nauseating comments of concern and care: "You haven't done your best." Look at how clearly these bourgeois lords reveal their reactionary stance.

The medical university implements so-called elimination policies, using various excuses to expel a large number of workers' and peasants' children. In the medical university's 1958 class, 30% of the workers' and peasants' students were eliminated in just two years, and half of the Communist Party members were eliminated. In the 1961 class, three years of preparatory school, eleven out of twelve eliminated students were children of workers and cadres. To expel and attack children of workers and peasants, and to cultivate bourgeois successors, this is the essence of the bourgeois educational line. The educational line implemented by the medical university is the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, and it must be thoroughly criticized.

    医大校门为谁开？
    中国医科大学六年级革命同学
    中国医科大学每年只收六十名学生，而招生地区又死死限制在北京、上海、天津、南京等大城市，说什么：这些城市的学生“水平高”、“基础好”、“聪明灵活”。这是一条什么样的招生路线呢？能够进医大的工农子女有多少呢？仅举一例，从一九五九——一九六二年四年北京地区招的新生中，工农子女只占百分之五，而资产阶级子女占百分之五，五类分子子女也占百分之五。这是多么触目惊心的数字啊！从这里可以清楚地看出医大校门是为谁开放的。
    从工农子女进入医大校门的第一天起，医大的走资派和反动学术“权威”就一刻也没有放松对他们的迫害和打击。一个学生（共产党员）的作业明明做对了，但遭到的是轻蔑的猜疑，作业本上被加上污辱性的评语：“这是你自己做的吗？”“不要不懂装懂！”如果是他们所赏识的高材生、资产阶级子女，就是做错了，作业本上还加上了几句令人作呕的关心、体贴的评语：“未尽你最大的努力。”你看这些资产阶级老爷的反动立场是多么鲜明。
    医大对学生实行所谓淘汰制，用种种借口把大批工农子女踢出校门。医大一九五八级的工农同学，两年中就被淘汰了百分之三十，共产党员被淘汰了一半。一九六一级三年预科被淘汰的十二名学生中，工农干部子女竟有十一名。排挤打击工农子弟，培植资产阶级接班人，这正是资产阶级教育路线的实质。医大执行的教育路线，正是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，必须彻底批判。
