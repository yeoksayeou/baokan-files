Over a thousand representatives, using the form of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, overcame factionalism, strengthened their Party spirit, and laid a solid ideological foundation for further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

XINING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai Provincial Conference of Representatives of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works was held in Xining from Jan. 11 to 26. Over a thousand representatives, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, took Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guiding principle, and used the form of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. They overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened their proletarian Party spirit, and laid a solid ideological foundation for further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This was a conference for exchanging experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. It was also a rally to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carry out the five major tasks proposed by the Party Central Committee for 1968.

At the closing of the conference, all the representatives and over 100,000 people from various ethnic groups in Xining held a rally to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the meeting, a telegram of respect to our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao and a letter of determination to Vice Chairman Lin were read, and an initiative was issued to the people of all ethnic groups in the province to push the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights.

Throughout the conference, the focus was on studying, implementing, and carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily. The representatives brought various problems from their revolutionary and production practices, seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the "Old Five Articles," and the New Year's editorials. They examined their own work and thoughts, identified gaps, and made corresponding plans. They deeply felt that to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, conducting revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, have extensively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, especially Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This has brought the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works in Qinghai to a new stage. Its distinctive features are: swiftness, breadth, depth, and practicality. Swiftness means following Chairman Mao's latest instructions swiftly and decisively. Breadth means mobilizing everyone, from top to bottom, old and young, comprehensively and extensively. Depth means having a clear purpose and direction, engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and touching the soul deeply. Practicality means implementing every measure firmly and decisively.

The representatives attending the conference summarized and exchanged experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, especially in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They focused on four aspects to share their experiences:

First, one must have a deep class sentiment of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and actively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The representatives pointed out that the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, whether to read Chairman Mao's books, and whether to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, all depend on whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. With loyalty at the forefront, one will actively study, resolutely execute, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, fully and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The representatives shared from their personal experiences: "Those who have endured the dark night know the brightness of the sun; those who have experienced the cold know the warmth of the sun." "One can leave one's parents for a lifetime, but one cannot leave Chairman Mao for a moment." "Without reading Chairman Mao's books and latest instructions, one's eyes are dark; with reading Chairman Mao's books and latest instructions, one's eyes are like bright pearls."

The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Qinghai used various forms to extensively promote Mao Zedong Thought's great contributions to the Chinese and world revolutions. Through class education, recalling bitterness and sweetness, and showcasing the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they continuously deepened their love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They said: Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Qinghai have achieved decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution because they have Chairman Mao in their hearts, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, defending Chairman Mao with their lives.

Second, one must focus on the "application" of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao taught us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it, and the purpose of mastery is application." The representatives unanimously agreed that studying Mao Zedong Thought must focus on the "application." Whether to apply Mao Zedong Thought or not is a fundamental stance and attitude. For every instruction from Chairman Mao, one must believe it without doubt, follow it consciously, and implement it resolutely. Only in this way can Chairman Mao's latest instructions be fully implemented. Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Qinghai have always taken Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and latest instructions as their guiding principles, studying and applying them, and focusing on the "application." After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary unity were issued, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Qinghai resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words and quickly achieved revolutionary unity by department and system. When Chairman Mao called for "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism," the proletarian revolutionary factions in Qinghai acted swiftly, quickly establishing thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, launching a wave of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and further consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

Third, the process of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is also the process of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Without thoroughly criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in various places, and without cleansing the filth from people's souls, it is impossible to fully and unconditionally implement and carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions. One must take the "Old Five Articles" as a motto, study them daily, use them daily, study them repeatedly, and use them repeatedly, sparking a revolution in one's soul, fiercely criticizing selfishness, and establishing public spirit. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the enemy of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. One must fiercely criticize and condemn factionalism, making it like a rat crossing the street, with no place to hide.

The proletarian revolutionary factions in Qinghai, through establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, strengthening self-education, and engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, have continuously overcome anarchism, sectarianism, small-groupism, pragmatism, and other bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts. They have eliminated interference, defeated factionalism, and ensured the full implementation and carrying out of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Fourth, perseverance leads to victory. Chairman Mao taught us: "One must 'grasp firmly.' That is, the Party committee must not only 'grasp' the main work but must also 'grasp firmly.'" The representatives pointed out that the leading members of various levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must be models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They must prioritize quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in all work, firmly grasp the most fundamental and critical issue of using Chairman Mao's latest instructions to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, hold on to it, persevere, and achieve results.

The representatives attending the conference also pointed out that to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, various levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must mobilize the masses, examine their work in light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, summarize the current situation, affirm achievements, identify gaps, and make improvement plans. They must pay great attention to discovering and setting up good examples, summarizing advanced experiences, and promoting them in a timely manner. For example, after Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "correctly handling cadres" were issued, the Qinghai Revolutionary Committee, on one hand, let all Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the province solve the cadre issue as a central topic, and on the other hand, vigorously promoted the experience of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Qinghai Red Guard First Machine Tool Factory in handling cadre issues. This had a significant impact on releasing cadres throughout the province and promoting the three-in-one combination. Currently, more than 80% of the autonomous prefectures, counties, and communes in the province have established revolutionary committees.

    青海召开全省学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会总结交流经验
    把落实毛主席最新指示放在一切工作首位
    一千多名代表用毛泽东思想学习班的形式，进行斗私批修，克服派性，增强党性，为进一步落实毛主席最新指示、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利打下了良好的思想基础
    新华社西宁三日电　青海省学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，一月十一日到二十六日在西宁举行。参加大会的一千多名代表，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，用毛泽东思想学习班的形式，进行斗私批修，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，为进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，打下了良好的思想基础。
    这是一次活学活用毛泽东思想、紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的经验交流大会，是一次落实毛主席最新指示、贯彻执行党中央提出的一九六八年五项战斗任务的誓师大会。
    大会结束时，全体代表和西宁市的各族革命群众十万多人，举行了青海省全面落实毛主席最新指示誓师大会。会上，宣读了青海省学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电和给林副主席的决心书，向全省各族人民发出了坚决把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向新高潮的倡议书。
    青海省学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，自始至终都把学习、贯彻、落实毛主席的最新指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论作为中心课题。代表们带着革命和生产实践中的各种问题，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示、“老五篇”和元旦社论，对照检查本单位、本系统、本地区的工作和自己的思想，找出差距，订出了相应的措施。他们深有体会地说：要夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，最根本的是要活学活用毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”一年多来，青海省各族无产阶级革命派和革命群众，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，大学大用毛主席著作，特别是大学大用毛主席对无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，使青海省学习毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新的局面。它的显著特点是：快、广、深、实。快，就是紧跟毛主席的最新指示，雷厉风行。广，就是上下呼应，老少上阵，全面发动，遍地开花。深，就是目的明确，方向对头，斗私批修，狠触灵魂。实，就是条条落实，坚决照办。
    出席大会的代表总结交流了活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是落实毛主席最新指示的经验。他们着重从四个方面，谈了落实毛主席最新指示的体会：
    一、一定要怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，积极落实毛主席的最新指示。代表们指出，对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，读不读毛主席的书，照不照毛主席的指示办事，关键在忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛泽东思想。忠字当头，就会积极学习、坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，不折不扣地全面落实毛主席的最新指示。代表们从自己的亲身经历中体会到：“熬过黑夜的人最知太阳亮，度过寒冷的人最知太阳暖。”“能离爹娘一世，不能离毛主席一时。”“不读毛主席的书和最新指示，两眼黑糊糊；读了毛主席的书和最新指示，两眼似明珠。”
    青海省各族无产阶级革命派和革命群众，采用各种形式，大讲特讲毛泽东思想对中国革命和世界革命的伟大贡献；通过阶级教育，忆苦思甜，大摆无产阶级文化大革命的成就等，不断加深了对毛主席和毛泽东思想的热爱。他们说：一年多来，青海省无产阶级革命派在文化大革命中取得了决定性胜利，就是因为心中只有毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，事事照毛主席的指示办事，誓死保卫毛主席的结果。
    二、要在“用”字上狠下功夫。毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”到会代表一致认为，学习毛泽东思想，要狠抓一个“用”字。对毛泽东思想是用还是不用，是根本立场、根本态度问题。对毛主席的每一条指示，都要坚信不疑，自觉紧跟，坚决照办。只有这样，才能把毛主席的最新指示条条落实、全面落实。一年多来，青海省无产阶级革命派始终以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和毛主席的最新指示作为行动指南，活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示下达后，青海省无产阶级革命派坚决听毛主席的话，迅速实现了按部门、按系统的革命大联合。毛主席号召“要斗私，批修”，青海省无产阶级革命派闻风而动，迅速办起了几千个毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了斗私批修的高潮，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    三、全面落实毛主席最新指示的过程，也就是斗私批修的过程。不彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人，不荡涤人们灵魂深处的污泥浊水，就不可能不折不扣地落实和贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。必须以“老五篇”为座右铭，天天学，天天用，反复学，反复用，在灵魂深处爆发革命，狠斗私字，大立公字。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是落实毛主席最新指示的死敌，对派性一定要狠狠地斗，狠狠地批，把它搞得象“过街老鼠”，永远没有藏身之地。
    青海省的无产阶级革命派，由于大办毛泽东思想学习班，加强自我教育，开展斗私批修，不断克服无政府主义、宗派主义、小团体主义、实用主义等资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，排除干扰，打倒派性，一直没有分裂成为势不两立的两大派，使毛主席最新指示的全面落实和贯彻执行得到了保证。
    四、一抓到底，就是胜利。毛主席教导我们：“要‘抓紧’。就是说，党委对主要工作不但一定要‘抓’，而且一定要‘抓紧’。”到会代表指出，各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织的领导成员，一定要作学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，要把迅速落实毛主席最新指示放在一切工作的首位，狠抓用毛主席最新指示宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众这个最根本、最关键的问题，抓住不放，一抓到底，抓出结果来。
    参加大会的代表们还指出，要使毛主席的最新指示条条落实、全面落实，各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织，必须放手发动群众，对照毛主席的最新指示，结合当前形势，认真检查总结工作，肯定成绩，找出差距，订出改进办法。要十分注意发现和树立好的典型，总结先进经验，及时推广。例如，毛主席关于“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好”的最新指示传来，青海省革命委员会一方面让全省所有的毛泽东思想学习班把干部问题作为中心课题来解决，另一方面，大力推广青海省红卫第一机床厂无产阶级革命派做好干部工作的经验，对全省各地解放干部，促进革命三结合起了很大的作用。目前，全省百分之八十以上的自治州、县和公社已经成立了革命委员会。
