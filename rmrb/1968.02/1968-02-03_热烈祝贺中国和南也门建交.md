The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen issued a joint communique on February 2, announcing that the two countries have decided to establish formal diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors. This is a milestone in the friendship between the Chinese and South Yemeni peoples, and a new development in the friendly cooperation between China and Arab countries.

At present, the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people is deepening. The Palestinian people, in their struggle to liberate their homeland, are waging a heroic armed struggle, continually striking blows against the Israeli aggressors, who are tools of U.S. imperialism. Independent Arab countries, in their efforts to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty, are waging a tenacious struggle against the old and new colonialism headed by the United States and its lackeys. The national liberation movement in the Arab region is surging forward with great momentum. The Arab people are advancing in their struggle against imperialism, growing stronger with each passing day. The independence of South Yemen is an important sign of the deepening development of the Arab national liberation struggle.

The Chinese and Arab peoples have a deep traditional friendship. Although we are separated by vast distances, our common struggle against imperialism has bound us closely together. The Chinese people firmly support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Arab people and rejoice in every victory they win. The Arab people warmly support the socialist revolution and socialist construction of China, and are jubilant over the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. The fighting friendship between the Chinese and Arab peoples, forged in our common struggle against imperialism, has withstood the test of time and has continued to develop. The friendly cooperation between China and Arab countries is also growing stronger day by day. Now, China and South Yemen have announced the establishment of formal diplomatic relations, which is another positive contribution to the friendly unity between China and Arab countries and to the cause of Asian-African unity and anti-imperialism.

The friendly cooperation between China and South Yemen has a solid foundation, which is the common anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle of the two peoples and the common principles guiding our relations, namely the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The joint communique of the two countries clearly states: "The two governments agree to develop friendly cooperation between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence." We are confident that the two countries will jointly uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, strengthen unity and cooperation in the struggle against imperialism, and have a very broad prospect for the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The just struggles of all the peoples of the world are mutually supportive." To counter the common enemy, imperialism, the Chinese and South Yemeni peoples, the Chinese and Arab peoples, have always supported and encouraged each other. In the future common struggle, the two peoples will unite more closely, strengthen mutual support and assistance. This is the common wish of the Chinese and South Yemeni peoples, and also the common wish of the Chinese and Arab peoples.

The establishment of formal diplomatic relations between China and South Yemen is a great joy for the peoples of the two countries. Long live the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and South Yemeni peoples! Long live the ever-developing friendly relations between the Chinese and Arab peoples!

    热烈祝贺中国和南也门建交
    中华人民共和国政府和南也门人民共和国政府，于二月二日发表新闻公报，宣布两国决定建立正式外交关系，并互换大使级外交代表。这是中国人民和南也门人民之间友谊的一个里程碑，是中国和阿拉伯国家友好合作关系史上的一个新的发展。
    当前，阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争正在进一步深入发展。巴勒斯坦人民为了解放自己的家园，展开着英勇的武装斗争，给予美帝国主义的工具以色列侵略者以不断的打击。已经取得独立的阿拉伯国家，为了维护民族独立和国家主权，同以美国为首的新老殖民主义及其走狗，进行着坚韧的搏斗。阿拉伯地区的民族解放运动气势磅礴，方兴未艾。阿拉伯人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中继续前进，越战越强。南也门的独立，就是阿拉伯民族解放斗争深入发展的一个重要标志。
    中国人民和阿拉伯人民有着深厚的传统友谊。尽管我们相隔万水千山，但是反对帝国主义的共同斗争，把我们紧紧地连接在一起。中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民的反帝革命斗争，并且为阿拉伯人民赢得的每一个胜利而感到高兴。阿拉伯人民也热烈地支持中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，并为中国人民在我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下所取得的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。中国人民和阿拉伯人民之间在反对帝国主义共同斗争中所结成的战斗的友谊，经受了时间的考验，得到了不断的发展。中国和阿拉伯国家的友好合作关系也与日俱增。现在，中国和南也门宣布建立正式外交关系，这是对中国、阿拉伯国家的友好团结，对亚非团结反帝事业的又一个积极的贡献。
    中国和南也门的友好合作关系，是有着牢固的基础的，这就是两国人民进行的反帝反殖的共同斗争和指导我们两国关系的共同准则，即和平共处五项原则。两国的新闻公报明确指出：“两国政府一致同意遵照互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处的原则发展两国之间的友好合作关系。”我们深信，我们两国将共同信守和平共处五项原则，加强在反对帝国主义斗争中的团结和合作。我们两国之间的友好合作关系的发展，将有着极为广阔的前景。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”为了对付共同的敌人帝国主义，中国人民和南也门人民，中国人民和阿拉伯人民，一向都是互相支持、互相鼓舞的。在今后的共同斗争中，我们两国人民将更紧密地团结起来，加强互相支持和互相援助。这是中国和南也门人民的共同愿望，也是中国和阿拉伯各国人民的共同愿望。
    中国和南也门这次建立正式外交关系，对我们两国人民来说，是一件大喜事。祝中国人民和南也门人民的友谊万古长青！祝中国人民和阿拉伯人民的友好关系不断发展！
