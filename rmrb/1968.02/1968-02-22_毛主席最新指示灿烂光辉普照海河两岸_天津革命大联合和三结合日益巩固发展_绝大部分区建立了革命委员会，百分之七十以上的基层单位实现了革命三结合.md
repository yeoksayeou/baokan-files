The brilliant light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions shines over the banks of the Haihe River. The revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in Tianjin are becoming increasingly consolidated and developed. Revolutionary committees have been established in the majority of districts, and more than 70% of the grassroots units have achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

A dispatch from the New China News Agency in Tianjin, dated February 21, reports: The Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee has mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with a spirit of "seizing the day," ensuring that every aspect is thoroughly implemented. The entire city has seen a high tide of consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and achieving the three-in-one combination. Out of the city's 13 districts, 10 have established revolutionary committees. More than 3,200 grassroots units have achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination, accounting for 74% of the total number of grassroots units in the city.

In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee has firmly stood at the forefront of the revolutionary masses, guiding the situation and becoming promoters and leaders in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The committee has mobilized the revolutionary people of the entire city to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to work with great enthusiasm, and to strive to be the best. A mass movement to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions has been launched throughout the city. The Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee recently held an expanded meeting, deciding to establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the city, mobilizing the masses to take "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key task, resolutely overthrowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, consolidating and developing revolutionary unity, promoting the three-in-one combination, and launching a high tide of establishing revolutionary committees at the district level and below, striving to achieve a situation where the entire city is red as quickly as possible.

After the expanded meeting of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, all districts and systems throughout the city immediately took action. So far, the city has established more than 45,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 1.65 million people participating in the study. In these study classes, the broad revolutionary masses, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have been criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism, and eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, thereby continuously consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and effectively promoting the three-in-one combination. Some districts have also formed propaganda teams consisting of workers, revolutionary cadres, and PLA leftist support personnel, who go to the grassroots units to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with the leaders, cadres, and broad revolutionary masses of the revolutionary mass organizations. In recent days, Tianjin's streets have been filled with red flags and drums, and everywhere there are teams reporting the establishment of revolutionary committees. In achieving the three-in-one combination, a moving scene of an entire district or an entire system turning red has emerged one after another. The brilliant light of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions shines over the banks of the Haihe River.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If there is only the enthusiasm of the masses without a strong leading cadre to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be able to last long nor be able to move in the correct direction and reach a higher level." In the mass movement to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the members of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the district revolutionary committees, the PLA soldiers executing leftist support tasks, and the members of various representative assemblies have gone deep into the grassroots and among the masses, first becoming students of the masses and then becoming teachers of the masses, fully mobilizing the masses, and fighting shoulder to shoulder with the masses, greatly promoting the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The main responsible persons of the revolutionary committees in Hanbei, Hongqiao, and Hebei districts have personally taken charge of key units and key issues, breaking through one point, summarizing experiences, and promoting the overall situation. The chairman of the Hanbei District Revolutionary Committee went to the Daily Chemical Auxiliary Factory, which had many problems, and specifically helped the factory establish a revolutionary committee. By breaking through this point and finding the experience, the establishment of revolutionary committees in all grassroots units throughout the district was rapidly promoted, achieving a situation where the entire district is red.
