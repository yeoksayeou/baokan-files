The Soviet seamen, who have a glorious tradition of the October Revolution, yearn for socialist China and look up to Chairman Mao, the contemporary Lenin. Whenever they come to Chinese ports and see Chinese comrades, they always eagerly express their ardent and sincere feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao.

The Aspiration of the Soviet People and the People of the World

Last autumn, a Soviet merchant ship was docked at one of our ports. One night, a few Soviet seamen quietly came to the room of the Chinese duty officer and earnestly requested that the Chinese duty personnel teach them to say "Long Live Chairman Mao Forever!" in Chinese. They said, learning to say this sentence is the aspiration of the Soviet people and the aspiration of all the people of the world. The Chinese duty personnel were deeply moved and taught the Soviet seamen the phrase word by word. The seamen learned it and joyfully shouted in unison: "Long Live Chairman Mao Forever! Forever! Forever!"

"Long Live Chairman Mao!" Whenever many Soviet seamen see the badge of Chairman Mao's portrait worn by Chinese duty personnel, they always express their love for Chairman Mao with this warm phrase. Once, a Soviet merchant ship was unloading cargo at a certain place, and a Soviet seaman obtained a portrait of Chairman Mao and a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The seaman jumped for joy and said, "I have long wished to obtain this red book and Chairman Mao's portrait! My dream has finally come true! I am overwhelmed with joy. My heart is filled with happiness. I will take the most powerful spiritual atomic bomb in the world—the Mao Zedong Thought—to the Soviet Union."

Once, a Soviet seaman told a Chinese comrade that Comrade Mao Zedong is the contemporary Lenin. Whenever I think of Chairman Mao, I can't help but sing "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." and instantly feel full of strength, as if finding direction in the mist and seeing dawn in the dark night. The seaman held up a Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and said, whenever I have time, I study the works of Chairman Mao. I am not afraid of being expelled, nor am I afraid of imprisonment or beheading. Chairman Mao is the savior of the world's people. Only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can the Soviet people overthrow the rule of the revisionists and regain their liberation from the oppression of revisionism. Resolutely Follow the Path Indicated by Chairman Mao

The books of Chairman Mao are the spiritual food of revolutionary people, and revolutionary people love to read them the most. Once, after a Soviet cargo ship docked, many seamen gathered to study the quotations from Chairman Mao: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, whether sooner or later, and will definitely achieve victory." After studying, a Soviet seaman excitedly said, I will definitely follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao and carry out a second revolution in the Soviet Union. We must learn from the rebellious spirit of the Chinese Red Guards, rebel against Brezhnev and Kosygin, and reestablish a true Soviet Socialist Republic of the people. The more the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries oppose our learning of Mao Zedong Thought and our revolution, the more we must learn Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely revolt. Another Soviet seaman said, with Chairman Mao, the Soviet people have hope. Mao Zedong Thought can make the Soviet revolution and the world revolution achieve complete victory. Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun.

A Soviet merchant ship came to Huangpu Port. An old seaman told the Chinese staff that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. We Soviet people love Chairman Mao and believe in Mao Zedong Thought without limit. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is very good. It proves that after the proletariat seizes power, it must go through such a great revolution to consolidate the power and prevent the emergence of a new bourgeoisie and new exploiters. The old seaman also excitedly said, Chairman Mao's saying that "Rebellion is justified" is very correct. The Soviet people need the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to carry out a second revolution. We Soviet people must resolutely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, bravely fight, break through the dark rule of the revisionist clique, and let the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought fly over the Kremlin!

Foreign seamen yearn for the revolutionary center of the world, Beijing, and for the red sun that illuminates the future, Chairman Mao. When they step onto the Chinese dock, the first sentence they want to learn is "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and the first gift they want to obtain is the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the Chairman Mao badge. This is a scene of several foreign seamen obtaining the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studying with Chinese comrades full of passion.

    敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
  　——苏联海员热爱伟大领袖毛主席的故事
    具有十月革命光荣传统的苏联革命海员，向往社会主义的中国，心向当代的列宁毛主席。他们来到中国港口，看到中国同志，总是热情地表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的热烈而真挚的感情。
    苏联人民和世界人民的心愿
    去年秋天，我国某港口停泊着一艘苏联商船。有一天，在夜深人静的时候，有几个苏联海员悄悄地来到中国执勤检查员的房间，恳切地要求中国执勤人员教他们用中国话说“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆”。他们说，学会这句话，是我们苏联人民的心愿，也是全世界人民的心愿。中国执勤人员听了非常感动，便一字一字地教给苏联海员。海员们学会了，他们高兴地热情高呼：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    “祝毛主席万寿无疆！”很多苏联海员看到中国执勤人员胸前佩戴的毛主席像章时，总是用这句热情的话语，向中国同志表达他们对毛主席的热爱。一次，一艘苏联商船在某地卸货，一位苏联海员得到了一幅毛主席像和一本《毛主席语录》。这位海员高兴得跳了起来，他说：“我是多么希望能够得到这本红书和毛主席像啊！我的梦想终于实现了！我喜悦的心情难以形容，我心中充满了幸福。我要把世界上威力最大的精神原子弹——毛泽东思想带回苏联去。”
    有一次，一位苏联海员对中国同志说，毛泽东同志是当代的列宁。每当我想起毛主席，我就情不自禁地唱起“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”顿时感到浑身充满了力量，象迷雾中找到了方向，黑夜里看到了曙光。这位海员举着一本俄文版的《毛泽东选集》说，我一有时间，就学习毛主席著作，我不怕被开除，也不怕坐牢和砍头。毛泽东主席是世界人民的大救星，苏联人民只有依靠毛泽东思想，才能推翻修正主义者的统治，才能从修正主义的压迫下重新获得解放。坚决走毛主席指引的道路
    毛主席的书是革命人民的精神食粮，革命人民最爱读。一次，一艘苏联货船停泊后，许多海员在一起学习毛主席语录：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”学习以后，一位苏联海员激动地说，我一定按照毛主席的伟大教导，在苏联进行第二次革命。我们要学习中国红卫兵的造反精神，造勃列日涅夫、柯西金的反，要重新建立一个真正的人民的苏维埃社会主义共和国。帝国主义、修正主义、反动派越是反对我们学习毛泽东思想，反对我们革命，我们越要学习毛泽东思想，坚决起来革命。另一个苏联海员说，有了毛主席，我们苏联人民就有了希望。毛泽东思想可以使苏联革命和世界革命取得彻底胜利。毛泽东主席是永远不落的红太阳。
    一艘苏联商船来到黄埔港。一位老海员对中国工作人员说，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。我们苏联人民无限热爱毛主席，无限信仰毛泽东思想。毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命非常好，它证明在无产阶级取得政权以后，一定要通过这样一场大革命，才能巩固政权，才能防止产生新的资产阶级和新的剥削者。这位老海员还激动地说，毛主席说的
  “造反有理”非常正确，苏联人民需要毛泽东思想的指引，进行第二次革命。我们苏联人民要坚决走毛泽东主席指出的道路，勇敢地战斗，冲破修正主义集团的黑暗统治，让马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜在克里姆林宫上空飘扬！

    外国海员心向世界革命中心北京，心向照耀前程的红太阳毛主席。他们踏上中国码头要学习的第一句话是“毛主席万岁！”要得到的第一件礼物就是《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。这是几位外国海员得到红色宝书《毛主席语录》后，满怀激情地和中国同志一起学习。
