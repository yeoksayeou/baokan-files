The delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam resident in North Vietnam held a press conference on the evening of the 7th to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of the South Vietnamese military and people in the New Year.

Delegation head Nguyen Van Tinh and military advisor Hoang Van Thong introduced the new situation of the South Vietnamese revolution at the press conference.

Nguyen Van Tinh said, the brilliant victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and people once again demonstrate the deep hatred of the South Vietnamese military and people towards the American aggressor bandits and the traitorous clique, and demonstrate the iron will of the 14 million compatriots in the South to overcome difficulties, turn deep hatred into boundless strength, stand shoulder to shoulder with the 17 million compatriots in the rear, and resolutely push the South Vietnamese revolution to complete victory.

Nguyen Van Tinh pointed out: The brilliant victory of the South Vietnamese military and people is a powerful blow to the warmongering clique of the United States. The 120,000 American aggressor troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops, due to being attacked fiercely everywhere, are in an even more passive and desperate situation. The already weak and rotten puppet army and puppet government are collapsing in large areas.

After exposing and condemning the recent savage crimes of the U.S.-puppet clique in bombing Saigon, Hue, and My Tho, Nguyen Van Tinh said, we sternly warn the U.S.-puppet clique: Your savage actions against the South Vietnamese people will only make the flames of hatred in the hearts of the South Vietnamese military and people burn even more fiercely, and will soon burn you to death.

Nguyen Van Tinh emphasized: The fierce battles on the South Vietnamese battlefield are still ongoing. The South Vietnamese military and people are determined to launch continuous attacks, not giving the enemy a single minute to breathe, to seize greater victories.

The Vietnamese People's Army and the People's Army Newspaper both published commentaries on the 8th, enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant victory of the liberation army in Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, in capturing the Wei Village stronghold.

The commentary in the People's Army Newspaper said: The liberation army's capture of the Wei Village stronghold has removed a stronghold of the American aggressors, breaking through the enemy's ninth highway defense line in the Xich Tho area. This is another heavy blow to American imperialism.

The commentary said: The battle of Wei Village proves that the American army is extremely incompetent and cannot withstand the fierce attacks of the liberation army. On the contrary, the liberation army can capture any stronghold of the enemy. The South Vietnamese military and people, who harbor deep hatred for the enemy, will surely sweep away all enemy fortresses. No defense system, no concrete and steel fortifications, can save the U.S.-puppet clique from destruction.

The commentary in the People's Army Newspaper said: The capture of the Wei Village stronghold was an outstanding annihilation battle. Such annihilation battles are of great significance. Only by annihilating the enemy's large number of combat-ready forces and destroying its bases and war tools can the enemy's aggressive ambitions be shattered.

The commentary said, the victory of the Wei Village battle proves that the main forces of the liberation army have sufficient strength to form a powerful fist and deliver a fatal blow to the American aggressor troops.

The commentary concluded: The American aggressors are currently being beaten on all battlefields in South Vietnam. The heroic military and people of Quang Tri Province must carry forward the spirit of continuous attacks, press on to victory, fight fiercely, fight on a large scale, and seize even more brilliant victories.

    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团举行记者招待会介绍南越军民新春大捷
    越南人民具有战斗到底的钢铁意志
    新华社河内八日电  越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团七日晚上在这里举行记者招待会，热烈欢呼越南南方军民的新春大捷。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进和军事专员黄文忠在记者招待会上介绍了越南南方革命的新形势。
    阮文进说，越南南方军民所取得的辉煌胜利，再一次体现了南越军民对美国侵略强盗和卖国走狗集团的高度仇恨，体现了一千四百万南方同胞不怕牺牲、战胜困难、把深仇大恨化为无穷无尽的力量、同大后方的一千七百万同胞并肩在一起、坚决把南方革命推向彻底胜利的钢铁意志。
    阮文进指出：越南南方军民的这一辉煌胜利，是对美国好战集团的有力打击。一百二十万美国侵略军、伪军和帮凶军由于到处遭到猛烈的进攻，处于更加被动、狼狈不堪的境地。本来已经虚弱和腐朽的伪军和伪政权，正在大片大片地瓦解。
    阮文进在揭露和控诉美伪集团最近几天对西贡、顺化、美萩等城市进行狂轰滥炸的野蛮罪行后说，我们严厉警告美伪集团：你们对南方人民的这些野蛮行动，只能使南方军民心中的仇恨烈火烧得更旺，并且必将很快地把你们烧死。
    阮文进强调说：目前南越战场上的激烈战斗还在继续。南方军民决心连续进攻，不让敌人有一分钟的喘息机会，以夺取更大的胜利。
    新华社河内八日电  越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》八日分别发表评论，热烈欢呼越南南方广治省解放军攻克卫村据点的辉煌胜利。
    《人民报》的评论说：解放军攻克卫村据点，拔掉了美国强盗的一个坚固据点，使敌人溪星地区的第九号公路防线被突破。这是给美帝国主义又一次沉重的打击。
    评论说：卫村之战证明，美军非常无能，对付不了解放军的猛烈进攻。相反地解放军能够攻克敌人的任何坚固据点。对敌人怀着刻骨仇恨的南方军民必将扫除敌人的一切堡垒。任何防卫系统，任何钢骨水泥工事，都挽救不了美伪集团的灭亡。
    《人民军队报》的评论说：攻克卫村据点是一场出色的歼灭战。这样的歼灭战具有十分重大的意义。只有全歼敌人的大批有生力量，摧毁它的基地和战争工具，才能粉碎敌人的侵略野心。
    评论说，卫村之战的胜利证明，解放军主力部队有足够力量形成强大的拳头，给予美国侵略军以致命的打击。
    评论最后说：美国强盗目前在南越各战场到处挨打。英雄的广治省军民必须发扬连续进攻的精神，乘胜前进，狠狠地打，大规模地打，夺取更加辉煌的胜利。
