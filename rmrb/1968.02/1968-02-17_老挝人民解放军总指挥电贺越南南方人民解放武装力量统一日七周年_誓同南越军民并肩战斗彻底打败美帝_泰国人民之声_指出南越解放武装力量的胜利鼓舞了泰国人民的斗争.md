Lao People's Liberation Army Commander Cables Greetings to the Seventh Anniversary of the Establishment of the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces

Vows to Fight Shoulder to Shoulder with the People and Soldiers of South Vietnam to Completely Defeat U.S. Imperialism

"The Voice of the Thai People" Points Out that the Victory of the Southern Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces Has Inspired the Struggle of the Thai People

	BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) - According to the Pathet Lao News Agency, Commander-in-Chief of the Lao People's Liberation Army Kaysone Phomvihane sent a cable on Feb. 14 to the Command Headquarters of the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces, warmly congratulating them on the seventh anniversary of their establishment.

	The cable said that over the past seven years, under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces, with high patriotic fervor and deep hatred for the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, have, together with the people of South Vietnam, overcome all difficulties and hardships, defeated the enemy's "special warfare," and also inflicted heavy defeats on their partial invasion warfare, achieving many brilliant victories.

	The cable said that at the beginning of this spring, the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces, with the support of the people in various cities who rose up to fight, launched a comprehensive offensive against the enemy and achieved great victories.

	The cable said that we are extremely excited about the great and brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces. These victories are powerfully inspiring and directly supporting the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle of the Lao People's Liberation Armed Forces.

	The cable finally expressed the determination to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces, to annihilate more enemy troops on various battlefields in Laos, and to contribute to the complete defeat of the common enemy of the two peoples, U.S. imperialism.

	BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) - The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcast an article on Feb. 14, warmly congratulating the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces on the seventh anniversary of their establishment and celebrating the recent Tet Offensive victories of the Vietnamese Southern people and soldiers.

	The article said that the establishment of the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces has rapidly promoted the development of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war and has made a great contribution to the common struggle of all peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism.

	The article pointed out that the brilliant journey of the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces over the past seven years has powerfully proven that true strength does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people. The recent Tet Offensive victories of the Vietnamese Southern people and soldiers fully demonstrate the strength of the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces; at the same time, it also shows that the end of U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam is near.

	The article emphasized that, as the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong has taught: "Without an army of the people, there can be nothing of the people." If armed struggle is abandoned, there will be no position for the people. The great victories achieved by the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces show that armed struggle is the only correct path for revolutionary people to expel U.S. aggressors and overthrow the reactionary and traitorous regime in their own country, and it is the only path for revolutionary people to achieve national liberation.

	The article said that the victories of the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces have greatly inspired the armed forces and people of Thailand, providing them with extremely valuable experience, making the Thai people more firmly believe that as long as they insist on armed struggle, the Thai people will definitely be able to defeat U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique.

	The article expressed that the Thai people and armed fighters are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the people and soldiers of South Vietnam and the Vietnamese Southern Liberation Armed Forces, to persist in carrying out the armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas clique to the end.
