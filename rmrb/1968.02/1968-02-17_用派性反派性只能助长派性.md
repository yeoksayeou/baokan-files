There are some individuals within our ranks who have severe sectarian tendencies. They are keen on opposing others' sectarianism but not their own. As a result, they fail to eliminate others' sectarianism while their own sectarianism grows.

Those who use sectarianism to oppose sectarianism not only refuse to acknowledge their own sectarian tendencies but also disguise their sectarianism, claiming that "line struggles cannot be compromised" and "principles cannot be conceded." Consequently, although both sides are revolutionary mass organizations with common goals, they should unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seeking common ground while reserving differences. However, due to sectarianism, they ignore the common ground and focus on minor differences. This hinders the realization of the great revolutionary unity.

Those who use sectarianism to oppose sectarianism often "strike first." At certain times and in certain situations, they can admit to having "some sectarian tendencies" and even "criticize" themselves. However, they do this not to eliminate their own sectarianism but to gain the initiative in opposing others' sectarianism. To achieve this, they use a magnifying glass to view their own sectarianism and a microscope to view others'. In the end, their own sectarianism seems insignificant, while others' sectarianism appears "heinous." As a result, they are constantly busy opposing others' sectarianism, and the rift with brother revolutionary organizations deepens.

Those who use sectarianism to oppose sectarianism often use the excuse that "to oppose sectarianism, everyone should do it together," urging others to oppose it first while they do it later or not at all. Their goal is not to genuinely oppose sectarianism together with brother revolutionary organizations but to gather material to defame others while they oppose sectarianism, aiming to negate the others' direction of struggle. The result is that they constantly call for opposing sectarianism, but sectarianism becomes more severe. Not only does the great revolutionary unity not materialize, but it even develops into armed struggles.

Using sectarianism to oppose sectarianism only exacerbates sectarianism, causing pain to friends and joy to enemies, allowing bad elements to take advantage of the chaos, and seriously disrupting the direction of the struggle.

Whether one can consciously overcome sectarianism is an important indicator of whether one is willing to be a genuine proletarian revolutionary in the new situation.

Using sectarianism to oppose sectarianism is futile!

### 用派性反派性只能助长派性

    用派性反派性只能助长派性
    我们队伍中有一些派性严重的人，他们热衷于反别人的派性，而不反自己的派性；这样，别人的派性反不掉，自己的派性反而发展了。
    用派性反派性的人，他们不仅不承认自己有派性，甚至还把自己的派性乔装打扮一番，说什么“路线斗争不能调和”、“原则问题不能让步”。因此，双方明明都是革命群众组织，有共同的战斗目标，本应在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，“求大同，存小异”，联合起来，却由于派性作怪，置“大同”于不顾，专在“小异”上做文章。结果，阻碍了革命大联合的实现。
    用派性反派性的人，又往往“先发制人”。他们在某些时候、某些场合，也可以承认自己“有些派性”，也可以“批判”一下自己。但是，他们这样做并不是为了打倒自己的派性，而是为了在反对对方的派性时“争取主动权”。为此，他们拿缩小镜来看自己的派性，拿放大镜去看别人的派性。看来看去，自己的派性微不足道，而别人的派性却是“罪大恶极”。这样一来，他们成天忙于大反别人的派性，同兄弟革命组织的隔阂越来越深。
    用派性反派性的人，往往借口“要反派性大家一起反”，叫别人先反，而自己后反，甚至不反。他们这样做的目的，并非真诚地和兄弟革命组织一起大反派性，而是为了在别人反派性时，捞到搞臭别人的材料，以便乘机否定对方的斗争大方向。其结果，天天都叫着反派性，但派性却越来越严重，不仅革命的大联合搞不起来，甚至发展到搞武斗的地步。
    用派性反派性，只能使派性恶性发作，只能使亲者痛，仇者快，让坏人乘机混水摸鱼，使斗争的大方向受到严重干扰。
    能不能自觉地克服派性，是在新形势下愿不愿做真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。
    用派性反派性休矣！　（《新贵州报》）
