New China News Agency, Hanoi, February 9 – According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam cabled Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on February 6, expressing his gratitude for the warm congratulations on the brilliant victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam since the New Year.

The cable said: In the fervent days of the New Year, all compatriots and soldiers in the South, in the midst of continuous attacks, widespread uprisings, overwhelming the enemy, and achieving great victories, listened with firm belief and boundless excitement to Chairman Ho's great encouragement and enthusiastic praise for all compatriots, the People's Liberation Armed Forces, and all other patriotic forces in South Vietnam.

The cable pointed out that Chairman Ho's encouragement and praise are a great honor to the military and people of the South, adding to their strength and reinforcing their belief in victory.

The cable said that in the past ten days, the people of South Vietnam, under the banner of the National Liberation Front, have united as one, overcoming countless difficulties, thwarting the various aggressive plans of American imperialism, and achieving extremely brilliant victories. The South's military and people's storm-like attacks and widespread uprisings during this New Year have left the enemy in a state of panic. These victories have opened up a very favorable new situation for the revolutionary struggle to liberate the South. Nothing can save American imperialist invaders from complete failure and the thorough collapse and disintegration of the puppet government and army. Even more brilliant victories await the people of South Vietnam.

The cable said that the extremely great and comprehensive victories achieved by the people of the South are inseparable from the wholehearted help of 17 million compatriots in the North and the constant care of our great national leader, Chairman Ho, for the people of the South. These victories are also inseparable from the precious support and help of brothers and friends from the five continents. The cable said that at present, the American bandits are suffering heavy defeats and are in a state of panic. Due to their nature of aggression and war, the American bandits, in their dying struggles, will still resort to many brutal means and cunning plots. However, no plots or means can stop our people from continuing to march towards final victory.

The cable said that the people of the South guarantee: They will not let down Chairman Ho's praise, nor will they let down the trust of 17 million compatriots in the North and brothers and friends from the five continents. The people of the South and the People's Liberation Armed Forces will carry forward the revolutionary tradition of national unity, resolutely launch continuous attacks, fight tenaciously, and rise up everywhere to fight; resolutely not allow the enemy to raise their heads, smash the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, annihilate the puppet army, overthrow the puppet government, seize complete victory, and fully fulfill their glorious duty to the Vietnamese nation and their duty to all nations fighting against American imperialism for peace, independence, democracy, and social progress.

The cable finally said: South Vietnam will definitely be liberated!

The Vietnamese people will definitely win!

Vietnam will definitely be reunified!

Wishing Chairman Ho good health and longevity!

Wishing the compatriots in the North more great victories in their battles and production!

    新华社河内九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿，六日打电报给越南民主共和国主席胡志明，感谢他对越南南方军民新春以来取得的辉煌胜利的热烈祝贺。
    电报说：在革命的热气腾腾的新春日子里，南方全体同胞和战士在连续进攻、广泛奋起斗争、压倒敌人、胜利巨大的气势中，以坚定的信念和无限兴奋的心情，倾听胡主席对越南南方全体同胞、人民解放武装力量和其他所有爱国力量的巨大鼓舞和充满热情的赞扬。
    电报指出，胡主席的鼓舞和赞扬是给南方军民的巨大荣誉，使他们增添了力量和加强了必胜的信念。
    电报说，近十天来，越南南方人民在民族解放阵线的旗帜下，团结一致，万众一心，克服了千艰万难，挫败了美帝国主义的种种侵略计划，取得了极其辉煌的胜利。南方军民今年新春的暴风雨般的进攻和广泛的奋起斗争，使敌人惊慌万状。这些胜利为解放南方的革命斗争打开了一个非常有利的新局面。没有什么可以挽救美帝国主义侵略者的彻底失败和伪政权、伪军的彻底崩溃与瓦解。更加辉煌的胜利正在等待着越南南方人民。
    电报说，南方人民所取得的极其巨大和全面的胜利，是同一千七百万北方骨肉同胞全心全力的帮助和我们民族的伟大领袖胡主席对南方人民的每时每刻的关怀照顾分不开的，是同五大洲兄弟朋友宝贵的支持和帮助分不开的。电报说，目前，美国强盗正在遭到惨重的失败，惊慌失措。由于侵略和好战的本性，美国强盗在进行垂死挣扎的时候，还要采取许多残暴的手段和狡猾的阴谋。但是，没有什么阴谋和手段可以阻止我国人民一直走向最后胜利。
    电报说，南方人民保证：决心不辜负胡主席的赞扬，不辜负一千七百万北方骨肉同胞和五大洲兄弟朋友的信任。南方人民和人民解放武装力量发扬全民团结的革命传统，坚决连续进攻，顽强战斗，到处奋起斗争；坚决不让敌人抬起头来，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略野心，击溃伪军，推翻伪政权，夺取彻底胜利，最充分地完成对越南民族的光荣义务和对正在为反对美帝国主义，争取和平、独立、民主和社会进步而斗争的各个民族的义务。
    电报最后说，越南南方必定获得解放！
    越南人民必获全胜！
    越南必定统一！
    敬祝胡主席健康长寿！
    祝北方同胞在战斗和生产中取得更多的巨大胜利！
