	The masses posted big-character posters criticizing my shortcomings and mistakes, helping me to correct them. However, I couldn't understand it at the time. After participating in the struggle sessions in the study class, my thoughts became clear, my grievances disappeared, and I took up the responsibility of promoting production while advancing the revolution. I have made up my mind:

	Always treat the masses correctly, always follow Chairman Mao in revolution

	Li Zhìwāng, Party Secretary of Lǎoyāmǎ Dàduì in Hóngqí Yíng Gōngshè, Chónglǐ County, Hebei

	At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I was the cadre in our brigade who received the most criticism from the masses and was the first to be criticized. At that time, I thought: being a brigade cadre, I worked hard but earned few work points, yet so many big-character posters were posted about me. The more I thought about it, the more I felt wronged. From then on, I built a wall in my mind between the masses and me.

	After Chairman Mao issued the call to establish study classes, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses in our brigade enthusiastically responded. With the help of the PLA, study classes of Mao Zedong Thought were quickly set up. I participated in the first session. Before I joined the study class, the masses had already posted big-character posters asking me to come out and make revolution. I didn't say a word. This time, when I was asked to join the study class to learn Mao Zedong Thought, I was very happy and wanted to take the opportunity to vent my grievances.

	In the study class, everyone actively studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," using "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline to fiercely struggle against the "self" in our minds. For the first few days, I didn't say a word. In one struggle session, a community member mentioned my name while struggling against his own selfishness. This shocked me greatly. He said: "In dealing with the issue of Comrade Li Zhìwāng, the secretary of the branch, I have personal biases, and this is the 'self' at work." At this point, I couldn't hold back anymore. Everyone else was struggling against the "self," and I was still planning to vent my grievances. Does this conform to Chairman Mao's teachings? Can a communist do this? So, I went to Chairman Mao's works to find the answer. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our mistakes. No matter who it is, anyone can point out our mistakes to us." He also teaches us to "persist in what is good for the people and correct what is wrong for the people." I am from a poor peasant family and have lived and worked with my class brothers since I was young, with no grievances. The masses posted big-character posters and criticized me to help me, fearing that I would make big mistakes. Thinking of this, my grievances disappeared, and I also actively struggled against my own "self." Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should believe in the masses, and we should believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles." The masses helped me, and I worked with the masses. The masses welcomed me to come out and make revolution, but I thought I would never be a cadre again. This is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao and the biggest "self."

	After exposing my thoughts and digging out my selfishness, I had a correct understanding of the masses' criticism. I actively sought the masses' opinions and sincerely checked with the masses. Some community members said: "Retreating from the revolution is an attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We criticize you precisely to help you. As long as you lead us according to the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we trust you." The class brothers' advice made me realize that the poor and lower-middle peasants are the most obedient to Chairman Mao and the most reasonable.

	Once the thoughts are clear, everything becomes clear. Through study, I raised my awareness and took up the responsibility of promoting production while advancing the revolution. In the future, I will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, always treat the masses correctly, and always follow Chairman Mao in revolution for the rest of my life.

专栏：

    群众贴大字报，批评我的缺点、错误，帮助我改正，可是过去我想不通。经过在学习班斗私，我的思想通了，怨气消了，挑起了抓革命促生产的担子。我下定决心：
    永远正确对待群众，永远紧跟毛主席干革命
    河北崇礼县红旗营公社老芽茬大队党支部书记　李志旺
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，我是我们大队干部中群众意见最多，受冲击最早的一个。当时我想：当个大队干部，力气不少费，工分不多挣，可是给我贴那么多大字报。越想越不是滋味，打那起，我就跟群众从思想上垒了一堵墙。
    毛主席发出举办学习班的伟大号召以后，我们大队的贫下中农和革命群众热烈响应，在解放军的帮助下，很快就办起了毛泽东思想学习班。我参加了第一期学习班学习。在我参加学习班以前，群众就贴出大字报，要我站出来革命。我没有吭声。这回，让我参加学习班学习毛泽东思想，我很高兴，也想乘机出出“怨”气。
    在学习班里，大家积极学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。开头几天，我是一言不发。在一次斗“私”会上，有个社员在自己斗“私”的时候，提到了我的名字，对我震动很大。他说：“我在对待支部书记李志旺同志的问题上，有个人成见，这是‘私’字作怪。”这一下，我可憋不住了，人家都在斗“私”字，我还准备出“怨”气，这符合毛主席的教导吗？一个共产党员能这样做吗？于是，我就到毛主席著作中去找答案。毛主席教导我们说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。”他老人家还教导我们要“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”。我是贫农出身，从小和阶级弟兄们生活在一起，劳动在一起，没冤没仇。群众给我贴大字报，批评我，是为了帮助我，怕我犯大错误。想到这里，“怨”气消了，我也积极向自己的“私”字开火。毛主席教导我们说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”群众帮助我，我和群众拧着劲，群众欢迎我站出来革命，我却想再也不当干部了。这就是对毛主席最大的不忠，也是最大的“私”字。
    经过亮思想，挖私心，我对群众的批评有了正确的认识，我就主动征求群众的意见，诚恳地向群众作了检查。有的社员说：“退坡不干，这是对待毛主席革命路线的态度问题。我们批评你，正是为了帮助你，只要你领导大家按照毛主席指引的路走，就信得过你。”阶级兄弟的劝告，使我认识到贫下中农是最听毛主席的话，最通情达理的。
    思想一通，一通百通。我经过学习，提高了觉悟，挑起了抓革命促生产的担子。今后，我要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，永远正确对待群众，永远紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
