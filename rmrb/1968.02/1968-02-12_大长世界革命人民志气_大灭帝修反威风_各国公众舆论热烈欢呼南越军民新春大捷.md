On the 9th, the permanent secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference issued a statement in Conakry, warmly congratulating the military and civilians of South Vietnam on their brilliant victories in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation and expressing firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people until they achieve complete victory.

The statement said: The heroic armed forces of the people of South Vietnam have launched a comprehensive offensive on all fronts, defeating the American aggressors and their lackeys, causing them to suffer a crushing defeat and panic, and achieving unprecedented brilliant victories. The liberation struggle of the people of South Vietnam is truly brilliant and truly heroic!

The statement said: The people of South Vietnam firmly grasp the initiative in the battle. The heroic people of South Vietnam have developed the anti-American struggle for national salvation to a higher level. The great victories of the people of South Vietnam once again prove that, regardless of the size of the country, as long as a people's war is waged, any powerful enemy can be defeated. The great victories of the people of South Vietnam have set a brilliant example for the oppressed peoples and nations around the world who are struggling for liberation. These great victories have greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and greatly dashed the arrogance of American imperialism. The myth of American imperialism being "invincible" has once again been proven false. Under the swift and deadly blows of the heroic people of South Vietnam, the American imperialists have reached the brink of complete annihilation.

The statement pointed out that no matter how desperately the American imperialists struggle, the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people who are determined to carry the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation to the end.

Cambodian newspaper says the great victory of the military and civilians of South Vietnam proves the invincibility of the people's power

Recently, the Cambodian newspaper "Sun" published editorials and commentaries pointing out: The brilliant victories recently achieved by the people of South Vietnam have shattered the myth of the so-called "superiority" of the U.S. military and its lackeys. Facts have shown that the power of the people united is invincible and unstoppable.

The commentary of "Cambodian Daily" said: The current situation is that the U.S. invading army is "piled with corpses," U.S. aircraft are "turning into scrap metal in batches," and even the U.S. "embassy" in Saigon was once occupied.

The commentary praised, saying that the military and civilians of South Vietnam, in order to punish American imperialism and the puppet regime in South Vietnam, fought bravely and achieved brilliant results.
