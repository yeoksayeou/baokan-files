Shanghai Fifth Department Store's revolutionary staff have earnestly carried out the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "further economize and make revolution," launching a mass movement to economize and make revolution. In 1967, this store's commodity turnover increased by nearly 32 percent compared to 1966, while the cost level decreased by 25.4 percent. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary staff of this store have not added a single piece of equipment or tool due to the revolution, have not borrowed a single venue from other units, and when the revolutionary committee of the store was established, they did not hold a banquet or go to the theater. The new sign for the revolutionary committee was also made by the staff themselves. The staff have also promoted the economizing work of some enterprises and institutions in society through propaganda and other activities.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "economize and make revolution," some revolutionary staff of this store initially thought that everyone already paid attention to saving state funds and that there were no problems. Later, the revolutionary committee of the store and the revolutionary mass organizations discovered that there was a "saving to the limit" mentality among the staff, so they organized the broad revolutionary staff to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift, making everyone realize that thrift is not just about saving a few yuan, but is a major issue related to what kind of enterprise to run and what path to take. Every revolutionary staff member should highly value it. The revolutionary committee of the store also deepened everyone's understanding of economizing and making revolution through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively using Chairman Mao's works, and widely publicizing the party's policies.

After implementing Chairman Mao's instructions ideologically, the revolutionary committee of this store vigorously promoted organizational implementation. They mobilized the masses to establish "economic supervision groups," carry out mass economic supervision activities, implement economic democracy, and publicize finances. They also monthly reviewed and checked the enterprise's financial income and expenditure plans, actively supported the masses' suggestions on increasing income and saving expenditures, and promptly exchanged and promoted advanced experiences. They mobilized the masses to guide production and consumption through purchasing and selling activities, promoting social economizing. They organized staff to hold small group lectures on economizing and making revolution every month, affirming achievements, summarizing experiences, finding gaps, and clarifying the next step's goals.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "further economizing and making revolution," the revolutionary staff of Shanghai Fifth Department Store launched a mass movement to economize and make revolution. The characteristic of this mass movement is that within the enterprise, they start from the big picture and handle the small details, using every possible means to tap into economizing potential. The commodity group tightly grasped the work of saving packaging materials, proposing the "four goods, four no's," that is: unpacking goods well, packaging not damaged; managing packaging materials well, not scattering; using short ropes and broken ropes well, not throwing away; making good use of waste paper, not wasting. The entire store achieved full recovery of packaging for 24 types of commodities. The cotton cloth group, when cutting cloth for customers, also tried their best to be precise and save for the consumers, saving cotton cloth for the state. In addition, the sales staff also guided production and consumption, promoting the social movement to economize and make revolution.

    上海第五百货商店执行毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示
    发动群众千方百计挖掘节约潜力
    据新华社上海二十八日电　上海市第五百货商店的革命职工，认真贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示，掀起了群众性的节约闹革命运动。一九六七年这个商店的商品流转量比一九六六年增加近百分之三十二，而费用水平却下降了百分之二十五点四。从无产阶级文化大革命开始到现在，这个商店的革命职工没有因为闹革命而添过一件设备和用具，没有向外单位借过一次会场，商店革命委员会成立时，既不请客，也不看戏，革命委员会的新牌子也是职工自己动手做的。职工们还通过开展宣传等活动，推动了社会上一些企业事业单位的节约工作。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召后，这个店的一些革命职工起初认为，大家平时就很注意节约国家开支，不存在什么问题。后来，商店革委会和革命群众组织发现职工中存在着这种“节约到顶”的思想，便组织广大革命职工认真学习毛主席有关勤俭节约的教导，使大家认识到勤俭节约不是节省几个钱的问题，而是关系到办什么企业，走什么道路的大问题，每个革命职工都应该高度重视。商店革委会还通过举办毛泽东思想学习班、活学活用毛主席著作讲用会和广泛宣传党的方针政策，加深大家对节约闹革命的认识。
    这个商店的革委会在思想上落实了毛主席的指示后，就大抓组织落实。他们发动群众建立了“经济监督小组”，开展群众性的经济监督活动，实行经济民主，群众理财，财务公开，同时月月审议、检查企业财务收支计划，积极支持群众提出的有关增加收入、节约开支的各项建议，并及时交流、推广先进经验；发动群众通过购销活动，指导生产和消费，推动社会节约。他们每月都要组织职工群众举行节约闹革命的小组讲用会，肯定成绩，总结经验，找出差距，明确下一步的奋斗目标。
    在毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”光辉思想的指引下，上百五店革命职工掀起了节约闹革命的群众运动。这个群众运动的特点是，企业内部，从大处着眼，从小处着手，千方百计挖掘节约潜力。商品组对节约包装材料的工作就抓得很紧，提出了“四好、四不”，即：拆好来货，包装不损坏；保管好包装用品，不流散；用好短绳和断绳子，不丢掉；利用好废纸，不浪费。全店有二十四种商品包装做到了全部回收。棉布组为顾客扯布，也尽量为消费者精打细算，为国家节约棉布。此外，营业员还通过指导生产和消费，推动社会的节约闹革命活动。
