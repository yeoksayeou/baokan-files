In the face of the fierce attacks by the heroic South Vietnamese military and people, large numbers of South Vietnamese puppet soldiers have awakened and turned against their former allies, joining the ranks of those fighting against American imperialism and for national salvation.

According to incomplete statistics, in the first ten days of February, more than 3,750 puppet soldiers in the Thừa Thiên–Huế region surrendered to the people, bringing their weapons with them. In two days, 500 puppet soldiers in two communes near Huế City also surrendered to the people, bringing their weapons with them. In Quảng Điền, Hương Thủy, and Phú Vang counties, large numbers of puppet soldiers deserted. In one district of Quảng Điền County, nearly 1,000 puppet soldiers deserted in less than ten days.

In the first few days of the people's armed forces launching fierce attacks, large numbers of puppet soldiers in Huế City left the Saigon puppet government, establishing many patriotic soldiers' organizations and voluntarily joining the revolutionary ranks to fight against American imperialism and for national salvation.

On the night of February 16, a security company of the puppet army guarding the Lộc Nơi Airbase in Kiên Giang Province staged a rebellion, cooperating with the people's armed forces to attack the airbase. This contributed to the great victory of annihilating more than 300 enemy soldiers and destroying 35 enemy aircraft. The rebel puppet soldiers acted as guides for the people's armed forces and completely annihilated the puppet commanders and American invaders stationed at the airbase.

On the night of February 12, puppet soldiers in a post in Phú Vĩnh Commune, Củ Chi District, Gia Định Province staged a rebellion, capturing the evil elements in the post with the people and handing over all captured weapons and military supplies to the people's liberation armed forces. Another post's "self-defense force" platoon in this province killed nine evil elements on the night of February 11 and surrendered to the people, bringing all their weapons with them.

In Long An Province, a company of the "self-defense force" staged a rebellion in the early hours of February 5. The rebel soldiers took control of the defensive fortifications and transportation facilities, killing the most evil enemy puppet leaders, and opened the gates to welcome the people's liberation armed forces. The rebel troops and the soldiers of the people's liberation armed forces together killed or wounded 70 evil elements and two American invaders, seizing all the weapons in the post.

    在英雄的南越军民猛烈打击下
    南越伪军爱国官兵纷纷觉醒反戈一击
    据新华社河内二十二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：在英雄的南越军民的猛烈打击下，大批南越伪军官兵纷纷觉醒，携械向人民投诚，许多伪军官兵反戈一击，加入抗美救国的行列。
    据不完全统计，在二月份头十天中，承天—顺化地区就有三千七百五十多名伪军官兵携带武器向人民投诚。在紧靠顺化市的香茶县两个乡，两天内有五百名伪军士兵携带武器向人民投诚。在广田、香水和富汪等县，大批伪军士兵纷纷逃跑，仅在广田县的一个区，在不到十天的时间内就有近一千名伪军官兵开小差。在人民武装力量发动猛烈进攻的头几天里，顺化市大批伪军官兵脱离西贡傀儡政权，建立许多爱国士兵组织，志愿加入革命队伍，同人民一起抗美救国。
    芹苴省驻守洛代机场的一个伪军保安连，二月十六日夜间举行起义，配合人民武装力量向这个机场展开进攻，为这次战斗取得歼敌三百多名、击毁敌机三十五架的巨大胜利贡献了一份力量。起义伪军士兵给人民武装力量作向导，并把驻守这个机场的伪军恶棍指挥官和美国侵略军全部消灭干净。
    嘉定省古芝县福永乡一个哨所的伪军士兵，十二日夜间举行起义，同人民一道捕捉哨所里的恶棍，把缴获的全部武器和军用物资交给人民解放武装力量。这个省另一个哨所的“民卫队”的一个排十一日晚上打死了九名恶棍，携带全部武器向人民投诚。
    在隆安省，“民卫队”的一个连，在二月五日深夜起义。起义士兵控制了防御工事和交通设施，杀死了罪大恶极的敌伪头目，并打开大门欢迎人民解放武装力量。起义的部队和人民解放武装力量的战士共打死打伤恶棍七十名和美国侵略者两名，缴获这个哨所的全部武器。
