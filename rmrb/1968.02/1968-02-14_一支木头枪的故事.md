A guerrilla unit was established in a certain village in Phu Yen Province, South Vietnam, but they had not a single gun. How could they get their hands on some guns? Everyone was thinking of ways to do so. Guerrilla fighter Nguyen Van Hung made a wooden Tommy gun. When he showed it to his comrades, everyone laughed. Some said it looked quite real; others said, "What good is it if it only looks real? It can't kill the enemy, so how can we seize their guns?" Nguyen Van Hung replied, "At night, they can't see clearly. We can sneak into 'strategic hamlets' or places where the enemy is, and use it to threaten them. They are afraid of death, so they will hand over their guns..."

One night, Nguyen Van Hung and a few comrades piled stones on the railway tracks, stopping a train, and used the wooden gun to capture seven enemy soldiers (including a puppet army lieutenant), seizing six rifles and one pistol. They also sneaked into the enemy's railway station, using the fake gun to force the station master to hand over tools to dismantle the tracks, and removed two sections of rail, causing an enemy military vehicle to flip over. Later, they used this fake gun to capture several members of the puppet village government, seizing three rifles. Nguyen Van Hung and his comrades thus used a fake gun to seize ten real guns from the enemy.

As the entire South Vietnamese anti-American national salvation war achieved victory after victory, Nguyen Van Hung's guerrilla unit also continued to grow and strengthen. At an exhibition in the Central Region of South Vietnam, this wooden gun was displayed, and comrades continuously praised Nguyen Van Hung and his comrades for their cleverness and bravery, mocking the enemy's pitiful state.

    一支木头枪的故事
    越南南方富安省某乡成立游击队时，一支枪也没有。怎么才能搞到枪呢？大家都在想办法。游击队员阮进雄用木头做了一支汤姆式冲锋枪。当他拿给其他同志看时，大家都哈哈大笑。有的说，样子倒挺象的；有的说，光是象有什么用？打不死敌人就缴不到枪。阮进雄回答说，夜里看不清，摸进“战略村”或有敌人的地方，用它威胁敌人，他们怕死，就会交出枪。……
    一天夜间，阮进雄同几个战友，把石头堆在铁轨上，拦住了一辆火车，用木头枪捉住七个敌人（其中有个伪军中尉），缴获了六支步枪和一支手枪。他们还摸进敌人火车站，用假枪逼着站长交出卸铁轨的工具，卸下两节铁轨，使敌人一辆军车翻了个底朝天。后来，他们又用这支假枪捉住好几个伪乡政府人员，缴获了三支步枪。阮进雄和他的战友们，就这样用一支假枪缴获了敌人十支真枪。
    随着整个越南南方抗美救国战争的节节胜利，阮进雄所在的游击队也不断发展壮大。在南越中部中区一次会议上展出这支木枪时，同志们都不断称赞阮进雄和他的战友们的机智勇敢，耻笑敌人纸老虎的狼狈相。
