The Vietnamese People's Army Newspaper recently published a lengthy signed article by War Soldier titled: "The Failure of the United States is Obvious."

The article points out: The aggressive war launched by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam has suffered a major defeat and is heading towards complete failure. The article calls on the Vietnamese military and people to heighten their vigilance, wage a protracted war, and achieve a complete victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression.

The article states: The partial war launched by the U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam has entered its third year. On the South Vietnamese battlefield, the United States has a force of over 1.2 million, with nearly 500,000 U.S. troops as the backbone, equipped with modern weapons. The United States has already invested heavily in this war and will continue to do so. However, the failure of the United States is obvious.

The article points out: The most prominent manifestation of the U.S. failure is that the "backbone" of the U.S. military is being broken.

The "backbone" of the U.S. military in South Vietnam consists of various units distributed from Khe Sanh and Pleiku (Route 9) to the Mekong Delta, with My Tho Province as the gateway. Anyone familiar with the military situation in the South can see that the U.S. military is having its "backbone" broken.

Except for a few newly dispatched reinforcement units, all U.S. divisions and brigades have suffered heavy defeats, and their combat effectiveness has significantly declined. In 1967, 22 U.S. infantry battalions and 20 ARVN armored battalions were annihilated, and in 1965 and 1966, 23 U.S. infantry battalions and 11 armored battalions were annihilated. Many brigades have been so severely defeated that they have lost their combat effectiveness. As for the U.S. Marine Corps, they are in a desperate situation on the Quang Tri-Thua Thien battlefield; many of their units have only 50% of their original strength left.

The mobile forces, which are the "marrow" of the U.S. military backbone, are gradually decreasing. The United States has nearly 500,000 troops, but only 42 mobile battalions. Moreover, these forces are being dispersed by the people's war to various locations, making their mobile forces even more obviously reduced. A U.S. journalist recently exclaimed: "The Communist Party's (referring to the People's Liberation Armed Forces) attacks have dispersed U.S. forces to the point where they can no longer be mobile."

When the U.S. troops first arrived in Vietnam, Westmoreland arrogantly boasted about "search and destroy" and "breaking the backbone of the Viet Cong (referring to the People's Liberation Armed Forces)." The current battlefield situation is obviously developing in the opposite direction: the "backbone" of the People's Liberation Armed Forces has not been broken at all, but has become even stronger; it is the People's Liberation Armed Forces that are breaking the "backbone" of the U.S. military.

As is well known, the outcome of a war is first determined by how much and to what extent the enemy's combat effectiveness is annihilated, as Westmoreland put it, the "key" to victory is whether to "break" the enemy's "backbone." However, this "key" is not in the hands of the United States, but is held by the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the South, and they are opening the door to walk towards complete victory.

The article states: The second prominent manifestation of the U.S. failure is that after the failure of its second "strategic counteroffensive," the United States has been forced to retreat.

In the second dry season, from October 1966 to January 1967, the United States was still able to launch several "sweeps" and prepare for the "linkage city" sweeps. The third dry season has entered its fourth month, but the United States is unable to launch a single offensive. Since the failure of the so-called "linkage city" sweeps in early 1967, the United States has been unable to organize any sweeps larger than a division with offensive, "search and destroy" characteristics.

When discussing who currently holds the initiative on the battlefield, the article states: U.S. and other Western newspapers have given a very clear answer: it is the "National Liberation Front of South Vietnam that holds the initiative on all battlefields." The People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam have launched continuous attacks in various provinces, especially in Saigon, Cho Lon, Thu Duc, Can Tho, Vinh Long, Da Nang, and Hue, forcing the United States into a defensive and extremely passive position. As Western newspapers have said, this passivity is "not partial, but overall, not only strategic and tactical, but also passive in combat."

After the failure of the second dry season "strategic counteroffensive" (1966-1967), the United States' dream of creating a "turning point" for the war situation has burst like a soap bubble. Since then, the United States has been increasingly forced to retreat.

The article states: The third prominent manifestation of the U.S. failure is that all of the United States' strategies and tactics in the Vietnam War have failed.

Over the past three years, the United States has adopted various strategic measures: from organizing large-scale "strategic counteroffensives," launching "five-pronged offensives" and other sweeps, to concentrating forces for key counteroffensives; from attempting to "tear apart" the bases of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam to blockading the border; from redividing the work between U.S. and puppet forces to combining "search and destroy" with "pacification." However, all of the United States' strategic intentions have been thwarted.

Under the continuous attacks of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, Westmoreland is not only passive but has also suffered heavy defeats. He no longer dares to boast about "search and destroy" and "breaking the backbone of the Viet Cong (referring to the People's Liberation Armed Forces)" as he did in the past. He is forced to lower his strategic goals, proposing a shift from "search and destroy" to a "policy of attrition." Is this retreat not a sign of the United States' strategic incompetence and failure? All of the tactics used by the United States in Vietnam, which are mainly centered around artillery, armored vehicles, and aircraft, have failed. The current situation on the battlefield is: until it is completely defeated, the United States has no other strategies or tactics to adopt besides continuing to use these failed strategies and tactics.

The article states: The fourth prominent manifestation of the U.S. failure is that the strategic effectiveness of the U.S. military has significantly declined, and the strategic effectiveness of the puppet forces is rapidly being lost.

The U.S. expeditionary forces in South Vietnam are clearly unable to attack or defend, and their morale is declining. The U.S. military in the Vietnam War has become a "famous" force in military history, spending the most money, consuming the most ammunition, and launching the most wasteful and blind "sweeps." The proportion of combat troops in the U.S. military is very low, and they adopt a misguided and absurd way of fighting: the navy is stationed on land, while the army fights on water, and the marine corps fights in the forest; strategic aircraft are used for tactical cover, while tactical aircraft are used for strategic missions. Therefore, the U.S. expeditionary forces are a force with the lowest strategic effectiveness and combat efficiency. They cannot even save themselves, let alone save and defend the puppet forces. As for the puppet forces, despite having a large number of 700,000, they are still a force that is "terribly active," "disintegrating and fleeing" as soon as they enter the battlefield.

The article states: The fifth prominent manifestation of the U.S. failure is that the Saigon puppet government is on the verge of collapse.

The Thieu-Ky puppet government is fully exposing its corruption and incompetence. If the Diem government could still rally some upper-class elements and a few sects to maintain its facade, then today's Thieu-Ky puppet government has almost lost all of these.

As for the "pacification" plan plotted by the U.S.-puppet clique, it is not "facing a crisis of complete failure," but has actually completely failed.

The article states: The sixth prominent manifestation of the U.S. failure is that the United States is being pushed into a dead end.

U.S. imperialism has always believed that air power plays a decisive role in the outcome of a war. It has used a massive air force to launch a destructive "escalation" war against North Vietnam and regards it as an important strategic measure to try to save its failure in the South. However, the "most powerful" force that the United States uses as a lifeline is turning into the most ineffective force. The United States uses cannons, warships, and mines to make up for the ineffectiveness of its air force, but the result is still ineffectiveness. In the North, more than 2,700 U.S. aircraft have been shot down, and thousands of U.S. air pirates have been killed and captured. The United States cannot shake the will of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the country; it cannot stop the support of the people in the North for their 14 million compatriots; it cannot reverse the defeat of the United States on the South Vietnamese battlefield, but instead, it is worsening. Even U.S. newspapers have to admit: "The United States cannot solve any problem it tries to solve through this (i.e., bombing the North)."

U.S. imperialism stubbornly continues its aggression in South Vietnam and launches a destructive war of "escalation" against North Vietnam, which has resulted in unprecedented isolation in the world and strong opposition and condemnation from the people of the world and the American people. Obviously, the United States is being pushed into a dead end.

The failure of the United States is obvious, and it has suffered defeats both militarily and politically. In this desperate situation, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara, as a scapegoat for the U.S. ruling class, was forced to resign. However, the U.S. authorities remain very stubborn and will certainly hatch many vicious plots. But no matter how desperately the U.S. aggressors struggle, they cannot avoid complete failure.

The development of the situation in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam in 1967 has put the United States in an extremely desperate situation. The choice for the United States is: either admit defeat or escalate the war. In this serious situation, Taylor, on October 25, 1967, analyzed the four "possibilities" in U.S. war decision-making, "to achieve quick victory through large-scale intervention, there is a crisis of escalating the war; to withdraw completely, admit defeat; to retreat into various 'inkblot' strongholds; to continue the current policy and fight in a limited war." But he had to pessimistically conclude: "None of these possibilities are particularly attractive," and "there is no hope of finding a solution to this conflict." This is the U.S. authorities' confession of their unprecedented predicament of being cornered in the war of aggression against Vietnam.

The article emphasizes: The path that the United States has taken in Vietnam is not one where it can choose between victory and defeat, but only between failure and greater failure. It is clear that the United States is currently suffering a major defeat and is heading towards complete failure.

The article emphasizes: "As long as the U.S. expeditionary forces remain on our soil for one more day, the possibility of the United States escalating the war will exist for one more day. We are ready at any time to smash all of its military adventurist actions."

The article states: Although the United States has suffered a heavy defeat, it will not accept its failure. It is making a desperate struggle. However, the current war situation is very unfavorable for the U.S.-puppet clique. They are facing great difficulties in strategy, military, and politics. These difficulties are insurmountable for the enemy. On the contrary, the war situation is very favorable for the Vietnamese people. Although we will still face difficulties and trials and have to fight more arduously and make greater sacrifices, we will definitely achieve complete victory.

The article states: In the more than two years of fierce fighting against U.S. imperialist aggression, two prominent laws have governed the entire development process of the war. The law governing all U.S. activities is: the more it fights, the more it fails, the weaker it becomes.

Since the United States adopted the strategy of partial war in the South, three prominent phenomena have emerged: first, the more U.S. expeditionary forces increase, the greater the casualties and the heavier the defeats. Second, the more weapons and equipment the United States has, the greater the losses. Third, the longer the war drags on, the more the combat effectiveness of the U.S. expeditionary forces declines.

The article states: The failure of the United States on the South Vietnamese battlefield is not accidental, temporary, or partial, but is a continuous failure on all fronts, all battlefields, and all "strategic counteroffensives," and each season's failure is more severe than the last.

The article states: The law of the United States fighting more and failing more, fighting more and becoming weaker, is influencing and governing all of the U.S. military's activities on the battlefield. The United States cannot defy this law. The representative of the most reactionary forces of the contemporary era, U.S. imperialism, is in the process of decline and collapse, and it is waging an unjust war. For this reason, the United States was doomed to fail from the beginning of the war. In the entire process of the war, the more stubbornly the United States strengthens the war, the more it fails.

The article states: The law governing the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression is: the more it fights, the more it wins, the stronger it becomes.

The people in the South annihilated 30 enemy battalions in the winter-spring of 1965-1966; they annihilated 49 enemy battalions in the winter-spring of 1966-1967; and in the first three months of the winter-spring of 1967-1968, they had already annihilated 32 enemy battalions. It is clear that the people in the South achieve greater victories each winter-spring season. The three armed forces of the people's war in the South are rapidly developing, and their combat effectiveness is becoming stronger and stronger. They can not only engage in small-scale battles but also in large-scale, continuous, and long-term battles. From the mountains to the plains, from the countryside to the cities, everywhere is the domain of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces.

The article states: The situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield has clearly developed in the direction of the South Vietnamese people fighting more and winning more, fighting more and becoming stronger. This is also the objective law governing the development process of the people's war in South Vietnam. This law is determined by a series of objective factors: the Vietnamese people, who are fighting against U.S. imperialist aggression, represent the most revolutionary forces of the times, standing at the peak of the world revolutionary upsurge and in a strategic offensive position. Our enemy has a large number of troops, a lot of money, and a lot of weapons, but the political and military power of the people in the South is very strong, with an inexhaustible source of replenishment, and moreover, the people in the South are fighting under the correct and creative political and military leadership.

The article emphasizes: Because the law of fighting more and winning more, fighting more and becoming stronger is operating under the above conditions, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression must be a protracted war, in order to create conditions to turn the balance of power in our favor, seize the opportunity to achieve greater victories.

The article concludes: The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression is currently in a very intense stage. It requires the efforts of the entire nation to achieve even greater victories and the final victory. The stubborn Johnson clique, facing the inevitable failure of the war of aggression, is still struggling desperately. However, it cannot defy the law of fighting more and failing more, fighting more and becoming weaker. The current struggles of the United States are merely desperate struggles.

    越南《人民军队报》发表署名战兵的评论文章论述南越战场大好形势
    美帝国主义发动的侵略越南的战争明显大败
    越南军民进行持久战夺取抗美战争彻底胜利
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南《人民军队报》最近发表署名战兵的长篇评论文章，题目是：《美国的失败是明显的了》。
    文章指出：美帝国主义发动的侵越战争已经大败，并且正在走向彻底的失败。文章号召越南军民提高警惕，进行持久战争，以夺取抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利。
    文章说：美国侵略者在越南南方发动的局部战争，已经进入第三年。在南越战场上，美国拥有一支多达一百二十万名、以近五十万美军为骨干的、用现代化装备武装到牙齿的军队。美国在战争中已投入极大的赌注，并将继续投入更大的赌注。但是，美国的失败是明显的了。
    文章指出：美国的失败最突出的表现是：美军的“脊骨”正在被打断。
    美国军队在南方战场上的“脊骨”，就是由分布在从昆天、育庙（第九号公路）到湄公河三角洲的门户美萩省的各个美军单位组成。任何了解南方军事形势的人都可以看到，美军正在被“打断脊骨”。
    除了新派来增援的几个单位以外，美军的各个师和旅都遭到了惨重的失败，战斗力明显衰退。一九六七年有二十二个美军步兵营和二十个美伪军装甲营被歼灭，一九六五和一九六六两年，美军二十三个步兵营和十一个装甲营被歼灭。许多旅被打得丧失了战斗力。至于美国海军陆战队，则正在广治—承天战场上求生不能，求死不得；它们中间的许多单位只剩下百分之五十的兵力。
    作为美军“脊骨骨髓”的机动部队，正在逐渐减少。美国拥有近五十万军队，但只有四十二个机动营。而且这些军队正被人民战争的阵势分散到各地，因此它的机动兵力更加明显地减少。美国记者最近惊呼：“共产党（指人民解放武装力量）的进攻把美国的力量分散到了再也不能机动的程度。”
    当美军刚派到越南的时候，威斯特摩兰曾狂妄地叫嚷要“寻找和歼灭”、“打断越共（指人民解放武装力量）的脊骨”。目前，战场上的形势显然是正向着完全相反的方向发展：人民解放武装力量的“脊骨”丝毫也没有被打断，相反地是更加强硬了；而且正是人民解放武装力量在打断美军的“脊骨”。
    众所周知，战争的胜败首先决定于对敌方的有生力量歼灭得如何和达到什么程度，按威斯特摩兰的说法就是，胜利的“钥匙”在于是否“打断”对方的“脊骨”。但是，这把“钥匙”却不在美国的手里，而是由南方人民解放武装力量所掌握，并且正在把门打开，以便走向彻底的胜利。
    文章说：美国失败的第二个突出的表现是：美国在第二次“战略反攻”失败之后，被迫倒退了一步。
    在第二个旱季，即从一九六六年十月到一九六七年一月，美国还能接连发动几次“扫荡”，并为“联络城”“扫荡”作准备。第三个旱季已经进入第四个月了，而美国无力发动一次进攻。从美国一九六七年初的所谓“联络城”“扫荡”遭到失败以来，美国一直无法组织任何一次规模超过师的、具有所谓进攻、“寻找和歼灭”性质的“扫荡”。
    文章在谈到目前战场上的主动权属于谁的问题时说：美国和其他西方报刊已经作出十分清楚的回答，正是“越南南方民族解放阵线掌握着各个战场上的主动权”。越南南方人民解放武装力量在南越各省，尤其是在西贡、堤岸、厚义、芹苴、槟椥、岘港和顺化等城市接连发动进攻，使美国陷入守势，极其被动。正如西方报刊所说的，这种被动“不是局部的，而是全局的，不仅是战略战术上被动，而且在战斗中也被动”。
    在第二次旱季“战略反攻”（一九六六——一九六七年）遭到失败之后，美国企图为战局的进展打出一个“转折点”的梦想，象肥皂泡一样破灭了。从此，美国已日益明显地被迫倒退。
    文章说：美国失败的第三个突出的表现是：美国侵越战争的一切战略和战术都已失灵。
    近三年来，美国采取了种种战略措施：从组织大规模的“战略反攻”，发动“五路攻势”等“扫荡”，到集中力量进行重点反攻；从企图“撕碎”越南南方人民解放武装力量的根据地到封锁边界；从重新进行美军和伪军之间的分工，到“寻找和歼灭”与“绥靖”相结合。但是美国的一切战略意图都遭到了破产。
    在人民解放武装力量的连续进攻下，威斯特摩兰不仅被动，而且遭到了惨重的失败。他再也不敢象过去那样叫嚣“寻找和歼灭”以及“打断越共（指人民解放武装力量）的脊骨”了。他被迫把战略目标降低，提出从“寻找和歼灭”到“消耗政策”。这种倒退难道不是美国在战略上的无能和失败吗？美国在越南采用的、主要以炮兵、装甲车和飞机为中心的一切战术，没有一个不遭到失败。目前战场上的实际情况是：直到它彻底失败为止，美国除了继续采用这些破产了的战略和战术之外，再也无法找到别的战略战术。
    文章说：美国失败的第四个突出的表现是：美军的战略效力明显下降，伪军的战略效力正在迅速丧失。
    美国远征军在南方战场上显然是不能进攻，也无法防御，士气日益低落。美国军队在越南战争中成为战争史上一支“闻名”的军队，即花钱最多，耗费弹药最多，发动消耗人力物力最多而又最盲目的“扫荡”的一支军队。美国军队中，战斗部队所占的比例很低，他们采取本末倒置和最荒谬的用兵方法：海军驻扎在陆地上，陆军却要在水上作战，海军陆战队要在森林里打仗；战略飞机用来进行战术掩护，战术飞机却用来执行战略任务。因此，美国远征军是一支战略效力和战斗效率最低的军队。它自身难保，更不能挽救和保卫伪军。至于伪军，尽管它空有一个庞大的数目——七十万，但实际上仍然只是一支“活动差得可怕”，“上阵只有瓦解和逃跑”的军队。
    文章说：美国失败的第五个突出的表现是：西贡伪政权已摇摇欲坠。
    阮文绍—阮高其伪政权正在充分暴露出它的腐败和无能。如果说吴庭艳政权还能拉拢到一些上层阶层，几个教派，来支撑门面的话，那么，今天的阮文绍—阮高其伪政权就连这些也几乎全都失去了。
    至于美伪集团策划的“绥靖”计划，并不是“正在面临着彻底失败的危机”，而实际上已经彻底失败。
    文章说：美国失败的第六个突出的表现是：美国正在被逼进死胡同。
    美帝国主义一贯迷信空军对战争的胜败起着决定性的作用。它使用了庞大的空军力量对越南北方进行破坏性的“升级”战争，并把它看作是妄图挽救它在南方的失败的一项重要战略措施。但是，美国用作救命符的“最强大”的力量，正变成最无能的力量。美国用大炮、军舰和水雷来弥补空军的无能，但是结果还是无能。在北方被击落的美国飞机达到了两千七百多架，成千的美国飞贼被打死和活捉。美国无法动摇越南人民抗美救国的决心和意志；阻挡不了北方人民对自己的一千四百万骨肉同胞的支援；无法扭转美国在南方战场上的败局，反而日益恶化。连美国报刊都不得不承认：“美国不能解决企图通过它（即轰炸北方）来解决的任何问题”。
    美帝国主义顽固地继续侵略越南南方，对越南北方进行破坏性战争“升级”，已经在世界上遭到空前的孤立，遭到世界人民和美国人民的强烈反对和谴责。显然，美国正被逼进死胡同。
    美国的失败是明显的了，它在军事上和政治上都遭到失败。在这种危困的情况下，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉作为美国统治集团的替罪羊被迫辞职。然而，美国当局仍然十分顽固，它必然还会施展许多恶毒的阴谋。但是，不管美国侵略者进行多么疯狂的挣扎，也避免不了彻底的失败。
    一九六七年美国侵越战争形势的发展，使美国陷入了极其危困的境地。美国的抉择是：或者承认失败，或者扩大战争。在这种严重形势下，泰勒在一九六七年十月二十五日分析了美国在战争决策方面的四种“可能性”，“通过大规模干涉来速胜，有扩大战争的危机；完全撤退，承认失败；撤入各个‘墨渍’据点；继续执行目前政策，在有限战争中战斗”。但却不得不悲观地下结论：“没有一种可能性是特别有吸引力的”，“看不到给这场冲突寻求解决办法的任何希望”。这是美国当局对它在侵越战争中陷入空前的走投无路的困境的自供状。
    文章强调指出：美国在越南所走的道路，不是可以在胜与败之间进行选择，而只是在失败与更大的失败之间进行选择。很明显，美国目前已经大败，并且正走向彻底失败。
    文章强调指出，“只要美国远征军还呆在我们国土上一天，美国扩大战争的可能性就还要存在一天。我们随时准备粉碎它的一切军事冒险行动。”
    文章说：美国尽管遭到惨败，但决不会甘心于它的失败。它正在进行绝望挣扎。但是，目前的战争局面对美伪集团很不利。它们在战略、军事和政治方面都遇到很大的困难。这些困难，敌人是无法克服的。相反地，战争局面很有利于越南人民。尽管我们还会遇到困难和经受考验，还要进行更艰苦的战斗，付出更大的牺牲，但是，我们必定取得彻底胜利。
    文章说：在两年多抗击美帝国主义侵略的激烈战斗中，有两种突出的规律支配着战争的整个发展过程。支配着美国各方面活动的规律是：越战越败，越战越弱。
    自从美帝国主义在南方采用局部战争战略以来，出现了三种突出的现象：第一，美国远征军增加越多，伤亡就越大，失败就越惨重。第二，美国的武器和装备越多，损失就越大。第三，战争越延长，美国远征军的战斗力就越衰退。
    文章说：美国在南方战场上的失败，不是偶然的、暂时的和局部的，而是在所有战线上、所有战场上和所有的“战略反攻”中连续遭到失败，并且一季比一季失败得更惨。
    文章说：美国越战越败，越战越弱的规律，正在影响和支配着美军在战场上的一切活动，美国是无法违背这个规律的。代表当代最反动的势力的美帝国主义，正处在衰亡和崩溃的过程中，它正在进行一场非正义的战争。正因为这样，所以从战争一开始，美国就注定要失败。在战争的整个过程中，美国越顽固地加强战争，就失败得越惨。
    文章说：支配越南军民的抗美救国战争的规律是：越战越胜，越战越强。
    南方军民在一九六五——一九六六年冬春季中，歼灭了美伪军三十个营；在一九六六——一九六七年冬春季中，歼灭了美伪军四十九个营；而在一九六七——一九六八年冬春季的头三个月，就已歼灭美伪军三十二个营。很明显，南方军民每一个冬春季都比它前一个冬春季取得更大的胜利。南方人民战争的三种武装力量迅速发展，战斗力日益强大，不仅能够进行小规模战斗，而且还能够进行大规模的、连续的和长时间的战斗。从山区到平原，从农村到城市到处都是越南南方军民驰骋纵横的地方。
    文章说：南方战场的形势已经明显地朝着越南南方军民越战越胜、越战越强的趋势发展。这也是正在支配着越南南方的人民战争的发展过程的客观规律。这种规律是由一系列客观因素所决定的：正在进行抗击美帝国主义侵略的战斗的越南人民，代表着时代最革命的力量，正站在世界革命高潮的高峰和处于进攻的战略形势。我们的敌人拥有大量的军队、有许多钱和许多武器，但是，南方人民的政治和军事力量非常雄厚，又有无穷无尽的补充来源，而且，南方人民的战斗是在正确的和创造性的政治和军事路线的指导下进行的。
    文章强调指出：由于越战越胜、越战越强的规律，是在上述的条件中运动着的，所以越南人民的抗美救国战争必须进行持久战，以便创造条件，使力量的对比向日益有利于我们的方向转化，争取时机夺取日益巨大的胜利。
    文章最后指出：越南人民的抗美救国战争，正处在十分激烈的阶段。它要求全国人民必须作出最大的努力，才能夺取更加巨大的胜利和最后的胜利。顽固的约翰逊集团，面对着侵略战争的不可避免的失败，仍然在极力挣扎。但是，它是无法违背越战越败、越战越弱的规律的，美国目前的挣扎，只不过是绝望的挣扎而已。
