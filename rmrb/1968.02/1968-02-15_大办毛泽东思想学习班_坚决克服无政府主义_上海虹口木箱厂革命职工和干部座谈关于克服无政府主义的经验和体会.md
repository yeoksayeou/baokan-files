The following is a reprint of a report from the Shanghai *Liberation Daily* on the experience of workers at the Hongkou Box Factory in overcoming anarchism. It is an excellent self-education material for the masses. It provides a good analysis of the manifestations and dangers of anarchism. It is worth reading. — Editor

According to a report from the Shanghai *Liberation Daily*: The Revolutionary Committee of the Hongkou Box Factory in Shanghai, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places," has organized nine sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Using the "Old Five Articles" and other relevant teachings of Chairman Mao as weapons, they have engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism, launching a fierce attack on anarchism. Every worker and cadre in the factory has participated in these study sessions. Through the study, the individualistic and undisciplined tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie have been effectively overcome, and the revolutionary spirit of organization and discipline has been greatly strengthened, leading to a completely new situation in both revolution and production.

Recently, the Shanghai *Liberation Daily* invited some workers and cadres from the Hongkou Box Factory to discuss their experiences and insights on overcoming the trend of anarchism. The following are excerpts from the speeches made during the discussion.

“Self-Liberation” is Not Arbitrary Behavior

Du Jin-gen (Worker in the Circular Box Group):
In the past, I was influenced by the trend of anarchism and had poor discipline. I would work more when I felt like it and less when I didn't. If someone tried to interfere, I would use the phrases "self-education" and "self-liberation" to fend them off. I even thought I had a good reason: isn't the Cultural Revolution about letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves? Isn't it about self-management? Who else can manage me?

Through study, I realized that "self-education" and "self-liberation" refer to the proletarian revolutionaries and the working class using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, continuously educating and transforming themselves in the struggle against the class enemy. It means transforming the objective world while also transforming the subjective world. It is absolutely not about starting from "self" to engage in sophistry for anarchism. I originally understood these two phrases as meaning that individuals can be undisciplined and do as they please, which is extremely wrong. "Unified discipline is a necessary condition for revolutionary victory." A state of no organization and no discipline is harmful to the revolution in a hundred ways and beneficial in none. If this phenomenon is not overcome, it is actually doing the class enemy a great favor and will never achieve self-liberation or self-education.

I also thought about how, as a member of the working class, we should have a high degree of organization and discipline. Being free and easy, undisciplined, and without organization is a petty-bourgeois habit, a corrosive agent that disintegrates the revolutionary ranks. The working class should not be tainted by the dust of petty-bourgeois ideology. I used to live like a beast of burden in the old society, going hungry and cold. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that led us to liberation. Now, the unprecedented proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is a great revolution that touches people's souls and transforms their worldviews. How could I not transform my thoughts well, but instead pick up petty-bourgeois bad habits and produce anarchist thoughts?

After a struggle in my thoughts, my understanding improved: as a member of the working class, I should consciously revolutionize and strictly observe labor discipline.

Obeying Correct Leadership is Not Slavishness

Jiang Hui-lian (Nail Blank Worker in the Flat Box Workshop):
In the past, I had a serious slavish mentality and would blindly obey leaders, regardless of whether they were correct or not. Therefore, during the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, when the old party branch implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and incited the masses to fight each other, I became their faithful tool. After criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, although I had some understanding of my mistakes, I developed another idea. I thought that my past mistake was mainly in "obeying the leadership" and becoming a docile tool. Having learned my lesson, I decided that as long as I didn't repeat the same mistake, I wouldn't make another one. Therefore, after the proletarian revolutionaries seized power, whenever the new leadership assigned me tasks, I refused; whenever they made decisions and instructions, I resisted them. In the past, in addition to production, I also served as a broadcaster and a health worker, but now I let go of everything.

After studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, I realized that it is wrong to treat leadership indiscriminately. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Erroneous leadership that harms the revolution should not be unconditionally accepted but should be resolutely resisted." In the past, the old party branch implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and practiced erroneous leadership, which we should have resisted. The new leadership implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which is correct leadership, and should be resolutely obeyed. To resist and reject everything is not overcoming slavishness but practicing anarchism.

My thoughts opened up, and my enthusiasm also increased. Now, whenever I receive a task, I do my best to complete it.

The Authority of the Newly Born Revolutionary Committee Must Not Be Damaged

Wang Fu-yin (Worker in the Plywood Group):
At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, I didn't join any faction and felt unrestrained and carefree. During production, I was lax and chatty. The old authorities wanted to manage me, but I told them to step aside. The revolutionary rebels wanted to manage me, but I thought they were just like me, working in the workshop, and couldn't manage me. After the Revolutionary Committee was established, whether to attend meetings or not was entirely up to me. I not only did this but also influenced a group of people around me. Some leaders of the Revolutionary Committee talked to me, but I would find fault with them, scold them without regard to the situation, and damage the revolutionary authority of the newly born Revolutionary Committee.

Later, I attended the Mao Zedong Thought study class and studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the necessity to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat, which is a key issue for the victory of the proletarian Cultural Revolution." I was shocked. I wondered what track I was on with my casual and undisciplined behavior? The Revolutionary Committee is a new thing born out of the proletarian Cultural Revolution and is bound to have imperfections. As a member of the working class, I should start from a place of love and enthusiastically help the leaders of the Revolutionary Committee to do a good job, gradually establishing revolutionary authority. If I only find faults with the work of the Revolutionary Committee and scold indiscriminately, wouldn't I become an anarchist who doesn't want leadership, a saboteur? And this sabotage is not directed at others but at our own working class, resulting in pain for friends and joy for enemies. Once I thought of this, my mind became clear. From then on, I had a correct attitude towards the new power organs and the new leadership. When I saw their shortcomings, I no longer scolded indiscriminately but patiently and enthusiastically offered suggestions and help. At the same time, I also guided the masses who had been influenced by me in the past to maintain revolutionary discipline and support the newly born Revolutionary Committee.

Necessary Rules Are Not "Frameworks"

Xu Ming (Young Worker in the Plywood Group of the Flat Box Workshop)
Lu Wan-sheng (Worker in the Circular Box Group of the Flat Box Workshop):
In a previous period, some workers in our workshop broke all the rules and regulations related to production management, thinking they were all "regulations" and "frameworks." For example: originally, we all had individual production quotas and calculated the completion status every day; later, we thought "quotas are old frameworks" and did not implement them. Even the workshop dispatcher and relevant departments did not come to count the completion numbers. As a result, workers did as much as they wanted, and production became a state of no one taking responsibility, which affected production. Just at this time, the factory held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through study, we realized that the socialist economy is a unified planned economy, and production quotas and plans are indispensable. Even if some old plans need to be changed, they must be criticized and discussed and then approved by higher authorities before implementation. Using the excuse that production quotas are "regulations" and "frameworks" and arbitrarily "smashing" and canceling them is a manifestation of anarchist thinking.

We must thoroughly criticize the revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi pushed in enterprise management and resolutely break all the "regulations" and "frameworks" that restrict the masses' hands and feet under this line. However, we must protect and strictly observe the systems that reflect the laws of production and ensure the good order of socialist construction. In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders used quotas to pursue profits and material incentives; now, we proletarian revolutionaries are in power, and the quotas are discussed and formulated by us workers ourselves. We proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers must resolutely implement necessary rules and regulations. After our understanding improved, we all voluntarily restored our individual production quotas.

Not Becoming a "8260" Freeloader

Mao Qian-fang (Cadre in the Materials Processing Workshop)
Ji Ke-gong (Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Rebel Corps in the Materials Processing Workshop):
In the early stages of the movement, we "came out" relatively early, but because we didn't become cadres, we became depressed, just watching and not doing, just listening and not speaking, not caring about anything, gradually becoming "8260" freeloaders (i.e., arriving at work at 8 AM, resting for 2 hours in the middle, and leaving at 6 PM). Later, the factory held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and after studying, we had a great awakening in our thoughts. Chairman Mao said: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is working thoroughly for the people's interests." We thought about how, because we didn't become cadres, selfishness clouded our judgment, and we became freeloaders, which was shameful. Through study, we realized that becoming a freeloader is also a manifestation of the trend of anarchism. Looking back, we once fought to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, but now, because selfishness has clouded our judgment, we have become freeloaders and engaged in anarchism, which is a great disrespect to Chairman Mao.

Many comrades in the study class also sharply pointed out to us that anarchism is a reflection of the struggle between the two lines in the new situation and is a great enemy of the proletarian Cultural Revolution. Those who engage in anarchism are half-hearted revolutionaries who do not want to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. We seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings, fiercely fought against selfishness, and sincerely accepted the criticisms of our comrades. Now, we are once again actively participating in the Cultural Revolution movement. Wu Pei-lian (Statistician in the Production Service Group):
I joined the rebellion very early. After seizing power, I thought the revolution was almost over and began to become a freeloader. Through studying Chairman Mao's works such as "Opposing Liberalism" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," my thoughts improved greatly, and I realized that becoming a freeloader is a manifestation of anarchism, reflecting the incompleteness of the petty-bourgeois revolution. I thought about how Chairman Mao cares so much for us young people and has great expectations for us. However, at a time when the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has not been completely won, at this crucial moment of the final struggle, I became a freeloader, which is really unacceptable. The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt, and I decided not to be a freeloader anymore but to stand at the forefront of the movement and become a proletarian revolutionary who is determined to carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Now, I work with other comrades every day to study and criticize, and I take my work seriously.

Uphold Revolutionary Principles and Fear No Nails

Qian Yin-hua (Production Group Leader in the Flat Box Workshop)
Gu Fu-sheng (Worker in the Circular Box Group of the Flat Box Workshop)
Du Ting-gao (Guard in the Security Room):
At first, we couldn't stand the undisciplined and anarchic state of some workers and had proposed criticisms. But when we criticized, we always hit a nail, you criticized him for not observing discipline, and he would ridicule you for "always pointing fingers," saying: "You want to climb up!" We were afraid of offending people, so we turned a blind eye to them, just to keep the peace, which further encouraged the spread of anarchism. After studying "Opposing Liberalism" in the study class, we realized: "Liberalism in a revolutionary collective organization is very harmful." Using liberalism to deal with anarchism will bring great harm to revolutionary interests. Therefore, through self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, we corrected our attitudes. When we saw phenomena that violated discipline, we actively persuaded, advised, and stopped them. Practice has proven that as long as we get rid of the "self" and the "fear," and do thorough and detailed ideological work, the correct opinions of the masses will be accepted. In the future, we will continue to fight with everyone against anarchism, making this reactionary trend have no place to hide in our revolutionary ranks.

    大办毛泽东思想学习班　坚决克服无政府主义
    上海虹口木箱厂革命职工和干部座谈关于克服无政府主义的经验和体会
    这里转载的上海《解放日报》关于虹口木箱厂革命职工克服无政府主义的座谈纪要，是群众自己教育自己的好教材。它对于无政府主义的表现和危害作了很好的分析。值得一读。　——编者
    据上海《解放日报》报道：上海虹口木箱厂革命委员会，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”的教导，针对部分职工和干部中存在的无政府主义思潮，接连举办了九期毛泽东思想学习班，以“老五篇”和毛主席的其他有关教导为武器，斗私批修，对无政府主义痛加围剿。全厂革命职工和革命干部每人都轮流参加了一次学习。通过学习，小资产阶级的自由散漫性得到了有力的克服，革命的组织性和纪律性大大加强，革命和生产出现了全新的面貌。
    上海《解放日报》最近邀请虹口木箱厂的部分职工和干部座谈克服无政府主义思潮的经验和体会，下面是座谈会上的部分发言摘要。
    “自己解放自己”不是随心所欲
    杜金根（圈箱小组工人）：
    过去，我受了无政府主义思潮的影响，纪律性比较差，干活时高兴多做，不高兴就少做。别人如果来干涉我，我就用“自己教育自己”，“自己解放自己”这两句话做法宝，一下把人家顶了回去。我还认为自己理由十足：文化大革命嘛，就是要让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己嘛，除了自己管自己，谁也管不了谁。
    经过学习，我认识到，“自己解放自己”，“自己教育自己”，是指无产阶级革命派和工人阶级，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，在同阶级敌人作斗争中，不断地教育自己，改造自己。也就是在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界。而决不能从“私”字出发，为无政府主义进行诡辩。我原来把这两句话理解为个人可以不守纪律，随心所欲，这是极端错误的。“统一纪律，是革命胜利的必要条件。”无组织、无纪律的状态，对革命有百害而无一利。这种现象不克服，实际上就是帮了阶级敌人的大忙，也就根本不可能做到自己解放自己、自己教育自己。
    我又想到，工人阶级是一支有高度组织性和纪律性的革命队伍。自由散漫、无组织无纪律，这是小资产阶级习性，是瓦解革命队伍的腐蚀剂。工人阶级不应该沾染这种小资产阶级思想的灰尘。我过去在旧社会里过着牛马般的生活，吃不饱，穿不暖。是毛主席和共产党领导我们翻了身。现在，毛主席亲自领导和发动的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，改造人们世界观的大革命。我怎么能不好好改造自己的思想，却反而沾染了小资产阶级的恶习，产生了无政府主义思想呢？
    经过一番思想斗争，我的认识提高了：作为工人阶级的一员，应该自觉革命，严格遵守劳动纪律。
    服从正确的领导不是奴隶主义
    蒋惠莲（板箱车间钉坯工）：
    我以前的奴隶主义思想比较严重，不管领导是否正确，都盲目服从。因此，在文化大革命初期，当旧党支部执行资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众的时候，我做了他们的忠实工具。在批判了资产阶级反动路线以后，我对自己的错误虽然有了认识，却产生了另一种想法。我想，我过去错，主要是错在“服从领导”，做了领导的驯服工具。吃一趟亏，学一趟乖。我今后只要不再如此，就不会再犯错误了。因此，无产阶级革命派夺权以后，新的领导要我做什么事情，我都拒绝；他们有什么决定和指示，我也一概抵制。过去，我除了搞生产外，还担任广播员和卫生员的工作，现在样样都撒手不管了。
    到毛泽东思想学习班学习后，我认识到这样不加区别地对待领导是不对的。毛主席教导我们：“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。”以前，旧党支部执行资产阶级反动路线，实行错误的领导，我们应当抵制。新的领导执行毛主席的革命路线，是正确的领导，就应该坚决服从。一概拒绝，一概抵制，这不是在克服奴隶主义，而是在奉行无政府主义。
    思想开了窍，积极性也高了，现在我接到任务后总是尽自己的力量去完成。
    新生的革委会的权威不容损害
    王富银（拼板小组工人）：
    我在文化大革命开始的时候，什么派也不参加，觉得这样无拘无束，逍遥自在。在生产时，我松松垮垮，谈谈说说。老的当权派要管我，我叫他靠边站。革命造反派要管我，我就认为他过去也和我一样，是在车间干活的，大家脚碰脚，也管不了我。革命委员会成立后，要开什么会，参加不参加，全凭自己高兴。我自己这样做不算，还影响了周围一批群众。革委会有的领导人员找我谈话，我就找他岔子，不分场合地轰他一通，损害了新生的革委会的革命权威。
    后来，我进了毛泽东思想学习班，学习了毛主席关于“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题”的教导，不由大吃一惊。我这样随随便便，自由散漫，究竟是在什么轨道上走呢？革命委员会是无产阶级文化大革命的新生事物，难免有不够完善的地方，我作为工人阶级的一员，应该从爱护出发，热情地帮助革委会领导人员搞好工作，使革委会逐步树立起革命权威。如果专门找革委会工作上的岔子，乱轰一通，岂不成了不要领导的无政府主义者，成了拆台派吗？而这个拆台，并不是拆别人的台，正是拆我们工人阶级自己的台，结果只会使亲者痛，仇者快。我这样一想，心里就亮堂了。从此，我对待新的权力机构，对待新的领导，就有了一个正确的态度。看到他们有些缺点，我不再乱轰一通，而是耐心地、热情地提出意见，进行帮助。同时，还把过去受我影响的群众引导过来，维护革命纪律，支持新生的革命委员会。
    必要的制度不是“框框”
    徐明（板箱车间拼板组青年工人）
    陆万生（板箱车间圈箱组工人）：
    前一个时期，我们车间有些工人把一些生产管理方面的规章制度都破掉了，认为全是“条条”“框框”。譬如：本来我们都有个人生产指标的，每天计算完成情况；以后认为“指标是老框框”，都不执行了，甚至连车间调度员和有关科室也不来统计完成的数字了。这样，工人爱做多少就做多少，生产上出现了无人负责的现象，结果使生产受到影响。正在这时，厂里举办了毛泽东思想学习班。我们通过学习，认识到社会主义经济是统一的计划经济，生产指标和计划是不可缺少的，有些旧的计划指标即使要改，也要经过批判讨论，报请上级批准后执行。借口生产指标是“条条”“框框”，随便“砸烂”、取消，这是无政府主义思想的表现。
    我们对中国赫鲁晓夫在企业管理上所推行的修正主义路线要彻底批判，对在这条路线影响下设置的种种束缚群众手脚的“条条”“框框”要坚决破掉。但是，我们对那些反映生产规律和保证社会主义建设良好秩序的制度，就一定要保护，要严格遵守。过去，一小撮走资派利用指标搞利润挂帅、物质刺激；现在，我们无产阶级革命派掌了权，指标是我们工人自己讨论、自己制订的。我们无产阶级革命派和革命工人一定要坚决执行必要的规章制度。认识提高后，我们都自觉地恢复了个人的生产指标。
    不做“八二六○”的逍遥派
    毛乾方（制材车间科室干部）
    季克功（制材车间造反队队委）：
    运动初期，我们“杀”出来较早，因为没当上干部，想不通，就消沉起来，平时光看不做，光听不响，什么事也不管，慢慢地变成了“八二六○派”（即上午八点钟上班，中间休息二小时，下午六点钟一到，就拎起提包回家）。后来厂里办了毛泽东思想学习班，我们学习后，思想上有很大触动。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我们想想自己因为没有当上干部，私字作怪，当了逍遥派，真是惭愧。我们通过学习，认识到当逍遥派也是无政府主义思潮的一种表现。回忆过去，我们曾经为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而奋斗，现在因为私字迷了心窍，当了逍遥派，闹起了无政府主义，太对不起毛主席他老人家了。学习班上不少同志还尖锐地向我们指出，无政府主义是两条路线斗争在新的形势下的反映，是无产阶级文化大革命的大敌。闹无政府主义的人，就是不愿意将文化大革命进行到底的半截子革命派。我们认真地学习了毛主席的教导，狠狠地斗了私字，诚恳地接受了同志们的批评。现在，我们又象以前那样积极地投入到文化大革命运动中去了。乌佩莲（生产服务组统计员）：
    我很早就起来造反了。夺权后，认为革命差不多了，就开始当起逍遥派来。通过学习毛主席的《反对自由主义》、《将革命进行到底》等著作，我思想有很大提高，认识到当逍遥派是无政府主义的表现，反映了小资产阶级的革命不彻底性。我想想毛主席对我们青年这样关怀，寄予很大的期望。但是，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的总决战还没有取得彻底的胜利，在这最后搏斗的时刻，我竟当起逍遥派来，这真是太不应该了。我越想越惭愧，决心不再做逍遥派，而要站到运动的前面，做一个决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。现在，我和其他同志一起，天天搞大学习、大批判，对工作也负责了。
      坚持革命原则　不怕碰钉子
    钱银华（板箱车间生产组长）
    顾富生（板箱车间圈箱组工人）
    杜廷高（警卫室警卫员）：
    我们起初对部分工人中的无纪律、无政府状态很看不惯，也提出过批评。但批评时老是碰钉子，你批评他不遵守纪律，他就讽刺你“老是指手划脚”，还说：“你要得功往上爬！”我们怕得罪人，对他们就眼开眼闭，但求相安无事，这样就更加助长了无政府主义的泛滥。在学习班上学习了《反对自由主义》一文后，我们认识到：“革命的集体组织中的自由主义是十分有害的。”用自由主义来对待无政府主义，会对革命利益带来巨大的损害。因此，通过斗私批修，我们端正了态度，看到有违反纪律的现象，就积极说服、劝告和制止。事实证明，只要自己丢掉“私”字，甩掉“怕”字，认真地做深入细致的思想工作，正确的意见群众是会接受的。今后，我们还要继续和大家一起，同无政府主义进行斗争，使这种反动思潮在我们革命队伍中无处藏身。
