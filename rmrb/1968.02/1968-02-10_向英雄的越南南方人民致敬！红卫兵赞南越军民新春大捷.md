To the heroic people of South Vietnam! Red Guards praise the New Year victory of the South Vietnamese military and people

We pledge to be a steadfast backbone for the people of Vietnam!

The heroic armed forces of South Vietnam, combining military and civilian efforts, urban and rural areas, and internal and external forces, have launched a full-scale offensive on the battlefield in South Vietnam with an overwhelming force, achieving unexpected victories. The news of this triumph has reached us, and all the Red Guard fighters and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Beijing Normal University are overjoyed. We enthusiastically acclaim the New Year victory of the South Vietnamese people and extend our warmest congratulations and most resolute support to the heroic people of South Vietnam!

The New Year victory of the South Vietnamese people fully demonstrates the mighty power of the South Vietnamese military and people, fully exposing the paper tiger nature of American imperialism. This victory is a severe punishment for the likes of Johnson, who are escalating the war of aggression. It greatly boosts the morale of revolutionary people around the world and strikes a heavy blow to the arrogance of American imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

The New Year victory of the South Vietnamese people marks a new height in the South Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, and it signifies that the South Vietnamese military and people have elevated the people's war to a new level.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Vietnamese people are determined to fight a protracted war and will definitely drive the American aggressors out of Vietnam." "Seven hundred million Chinese people are a steadfast backbone for the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is a reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people." We are the loyal Red Guards of Chairman Mao, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are always concerned about the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation, always feel exhilarated by the great victories in the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and are always ready to join forces with the heroic Vietnamese people to drive the American aggressors out of South Vietnam without leaving a single one behind!

Victory will definitely belong to the heroic people of Vietnam!

The people decide the outcome of the war

The east wind brings good news, and the spring thunder announces victories, heralding the spring awakening in the south.

The heroic military and people of South Vietnam, you have fought well! Under extremely difficult conditions, relying on your own strength, you have beaten the most vicious American imperialism into a corner, making it desperate and disheveled. This is a great victory. The Chinese people salute you.

When we heard from the radio about your unprecedented great victory during the Spring Festival, especially when we heard the announcement from the command of the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces, proclaiming the glorious achievement of annihilating more than 50,000 enemy troops and dissolving 200,000 puppet soldiers in just six days, we were filled with excitement and read aloud the congratulatory telegram sent by our great leader Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho a month ago.

South Vietnamese military and people, you have displayed the great revolutionary spirit of fearlessness and daring to sacrifice everything. You have beaten the evil American aggressors into a state of disarray. We must learn from your great revolutionary heroism.

The New Year victory of the South Vietnamese military and people once again proclaims to the world: the most vicious enemy of the people of the world—American imperialism—can be defeated. Although it possesses so-called modern weapons and appears formidable, it is nothing but a paper tiger before the revolutionary people. Only organized and armed revolutionary people are an invincible great force. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The people, not a few new weapons, decide the outcome of the war."

United, we stand; together, we triumph

In the midst of celebrating the imminent victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, news of the inspiring New Year victories of the heroic people of South Vietnam has reached us. The heroic military and people of South Vietnam have demonstrated the immense power of people's war, displaying courageous fighting spirit and fearlessness in sacrifice, launching a full-scale offensive with overwhelming force and achieving unexpected victories, making the American aggressors disheveled and desperate. The heroic people of South Vietnam have fought well!

We are the Red Guards by Chairman Mao's side. We listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions. We will definitely support you with concrete actions and stand united with you, triumphing together.

We will closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, organize extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, and with boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, we will study and apply Chairman Mao's works. In our studies, we will emphasize the spirit of public service and focus on practical application. We will fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will build socialist China, the reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people, into an even more solid and powerful force.

We firmly believe that under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the heroic people of South Vietnam will definitely continue their efforts, overcome all difficulties, and march forward bravely, thoroughly defeating the American aggressors, thoroughly overthrowing the traitorous regime of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, and achieving the ultimate victory in the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation.

The power of people's war is boundless

The heroic armed forces of South Vietnam, during the Spring Festival, launched a full-scale offensive on the battlefield in South Vietnam, displaying their might, launching a surprise attack on the lairs of the American aggressors and their lackeys, annihilating a large number of the enemy's fighting forces, and striking the American paper tiger into a state of terror and panic, fleeing in all directions. This truly shows that the people of South Vietnam have firmly grasped the initiative in the war.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "By mobilizing the entire population, we create a vast ocean that can drown the enemy, providing the conditions to compensate for the lack of weapons and other deficiencies, and laying the foundation to overcome all war difficulties." The heroic people of South Vietnam have been mobilized to the broadest extent. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression has become a blazing inferno, burning the most vicious and brutal wild beast, the American aggressor, trapped in the inferno, into a state of disarray.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The days of the American aggressors in Vietnam are numbered." The heroic people of Vietnam will definitely win the ultimate victory in the war of resistance against American aggression.

    向英雄的越南南方人民致敬！
    红卫兵赞南越军民新春大捷
    誓做越南人民的坚强后盾
    英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量，军民结合，城乡结合，内外结合，以排山倒海之势，在南越战场上全面出击，出奇制胜。喜讯传来，我们北京师范大学全体红卫兵战士和全校革命师生员工无不欢欣鼓舞。我们热烈欢呼南越人民的新春大捷，并且向英雄的越南南方人民表示最热烈的祝贺和最坚决的支持！
    南越人民的新春大捷，充分表现了南越军民的勇猛威力，充分暴露了美帝国主义的纸老虎本质。这次胜利是对加紧扩大侵略战争的约翰逊之流的一个严厉的惩罚。它大长了全世界革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的威风。
    南越人民的新春大捷，标志着越南南方人民的抗美救国战争发展到了一个新的高度，标志着越南南方军民把人民战争发展到了一个高度水平。
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。”“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”我们是毛主席的忠实的红卫兵，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的无产阶级革命派，我们时刻关心着英雄的越南人民的抗美救国正义斗争，时刻为越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利而感到振奋，时刻准备着同英雄的越南人民一道，把美国强盗一个不留地赶出南越！
    胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！

    决定战争胜败的是人民
    东风送佳音，春雷传捷报，报道南方春晓。
    英雄的越南南方军民，“你们打得好！你们在非常艰苦的条件下，依靠自己的力量，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，这是一个伟大的胜利。中国人民向你们致敬。”当我们从收音机中，听到你们在春节期间取得气壮山河的空前大捷的时候，特别是当我们听到越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部发表公报，公布仅仅在六天内就歼敌五万多名、瓦解伪军二十万名的辉煌战果的时候，我们热血沸腾，放声朗读我们伟大领袖毛主席在一个月以前给阮友寿主席的贺电。
    越南南方军民，你们发扬了不怕牺牲、赴汤蹈火的大无畏的革命精神，把万恶的美国侵略强盗打得丢盔弃甲，人仰马翻。我们一定要学习你们这种伟大的革命英雄主义精神。
    越南南方军民的新春大捷，再一次向全世界宣告：全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义，是能够被打败的。虽然它拥有所谓新式武器，表面上气势汹汹，但在革命人民面前，也只不过是一只不堪一击的纸老虎。只有组织起来、武装起来的革命人民，才是攻无不克、战无不胜的伟大力量。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所英明指出的：“决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”

    团结在一起，胜利在一起
    在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，传来了英雄的越南南方人民振奋人心的新春捷报。英雄的越南南方军民施展人民战争的无比威力，发扬了勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲的革命精神，以排山倒海之势，出奇制胜，打得美国强盗狼狈不堪。英雄的南越人民打得好！
    我们是毛主席身边的红卫兵。我们最听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，我们一定用实际行动支援你们，同你们团结在一起，胜利在一起。
    我们要紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，大办毛泽东思想学习班，怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，活学活用毛主席著作。在学习中要突出一个“公”字，狠抓一个“用”字。全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们要把社会主义的中国——越南人民的可靠后方建设得更加巩固，更加强大。
    我们深信，英雄的越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，一定能够再接再厉，排除万难，奋勇前进，彻底打败美国侵略者，彻底推翻阮文绍—阮高其越奸政权，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。

      人民战争威力无穷
      英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量，春节期间在南越战场上全面出击，
  大显神威，猛袭美帝侵略者及其走狗的巢穴，大量歼灭了敌人的有生力量，
  打得美帝纸老虎丧魂落魄，豕突狼奔，真是“横扫千军如卷席”！这充分说
  明，南越人民已经牢牢地掌握了战争的主动权。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海，造成了弥补武器等等缺陷的补救条件，造成了克服一切战争困难的前提。”英雄的越南南方人民最广泛地动员起来了。越南人民的抗美救国战争布成了烈焰冲天的火阵，把美国侵略者这只陷入火阵的最凶恶、最残暴的野牛烧得焦头烂额，四处逃窜。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。”英雄的越南人民坚持战斗，一定能够赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
