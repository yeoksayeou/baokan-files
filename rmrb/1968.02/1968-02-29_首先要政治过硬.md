	First of All, Politics Must Be Firm
	Maintenance Worker Mǎ Chánglín

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, it is the soul. This means that compared to technology, politics must come first, it is the decisive factor. However, the Chinese Khrushchev opposes Chairman Mao's teachings, absurdly claiming that technology "decides everything."

	In our factory, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, following the Chinese Khrushchev, advocates for "technology in command" and "technology must be firm." However, they never demand that we be firm in our political thoughts.

	We workers believe that first and foremost, we must be firm in politics, and only then can we be firm in technology. The success of the innovation in our factory's warp-knitting workshop is an example. Our factory once purchased several circular knitting machines from abroad to produce nylon jacquard fabrics. In the past, the small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory regarded these foreign machines as sacred, not allowing workers to touch them. Thus, for several years, only a few products reached the designed four-color level.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the comrades in the circular knitting machine group of the warp-knitting workshop armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, established the idea of innovating technology for the revolution, criticized the clique's crawling attitude, and boldly carried out innovations. They quickly changed the past production situation and were able to normally produce four-color nylon jacquard fabrics.

	The initial victory boosted their morale. They studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao teaches: "In the realm of production struggle and scientific experiment, humanity is constantly developing, nature is constantly developing, and it will never stop at one level. Therefore, humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." Thus, they carried forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, proposing the combat task of trial-weaving six-color jacquard fabrics and conducting experiments. The design capacity of this machine was only for four colors, and their experiments encountered many difficulties. Some comrades' morale fluctuated. They studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao's teaching, "Our comrades must see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, to boost our courage," immediately made everyone's spirits soar and morale surge. Old worker Liu Xiuheng's denunciation of the old society moved everyone. Some young workers said: We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought today, and we will definitely be able to produce advanced products. At this time, comrades from the August 3rd Unit and revolutionary cadres from the workshop also joined the battle, helping them with Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, they successfully modified the machine's components and parts, weaving six-color nylon jacquard fabrics.

	This victory gave the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen who advocate for "technology in command" another resounding slap in the face. This shows that only with politics in command can advanced technology be produced.

    首先要政治过硬
    维修工人　马长林
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：政治是统帅，是灵魂。这就是说，政治同技术比较，政治要占第一位，是决定的因素。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却反对毛主席的教导，胡说什么技术“决定一切”。
    我们工厂党内一小撮走资派，跟着中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“技术挂帅”，“技术过硬”，可是，却从来不要求我们在政治思想上过硬。
    我们工人认为，首先要在政治上过得硬，技术上才能过硬。我们工厂经编车间的革新成功，就是一个例子。我们工厂曾经从外国买了几台圆机，生产尼龙提花织物。过去，工厂党内一小撮走资派把这些外国机器看得神乎其神，不让工人碰一碰。就这样，几年来，只有个别产品，达到过设计的四色的水平。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，经编车间圆机小组的同志，用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，树立了为革命而革新技术的思想，批判了工厂党内一小撮走资派的爬行主义，大胆动手革新，很快就改变了过去的生产面貌，能够正常生产四色尼龙提花织物了。
    初步胜利，鼓舞了他们的斗志。他们又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”于是，他们发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的精神，提出了试织六色提花织物的战斗任务，并且进行了试验。这台机器的设计能力只有四色，他们的试验遇到了很多困难，个别同志情绪有些波动。他们又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席的“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的教导，马上使大家精神振奋，斗志昂扬。老工人刘修恒对旧社会的控诉，同志们听了很激动。有的青年工人说：我们今天有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就一定能够织出先进的产品。这时，八三四一部队的同志和车间的革命干部，也来参加战斗，用毛泽东思想帮助他们。就这样，他们终于成功地改组了机器的零件和部件，织出了六色尼龙提花织物。
    这个胜利，给了鼓吹“技术挂帅”的中国赫鲁晓夫及其走卒又一个响亮的耳光。这说明，只有政治挂帅，才能产生先进的技术。
