The Fourth Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought in the General Staff Department Successfully Held

The broad ranks of officers, soldiers, and staff members, along with their families, of the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, have, in the fierce and complex struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, firmly grasped the fundamental task of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They have emphasized the "use" of Mao Zedong Thought, fought against selfishness, and established selflessness. With boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, they have striven to study, implement, propagate, and defend his latest instructions. They have vowed to turn the General Staff Department into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

"Spring breeze and willows, ten thousand branches sway, six hundred million people all become sages." Comrade Liang Zhenyou, a fine cadre nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, is an outstanding representative of the cadres of the General Staff Department and a model for countless revolutionary cadres. For twenty years since he joined the army, he has always had a red sun in his heart—our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao—inspiring him to serve the people wholeheartedly and be a loyal servant of the people. In July 1966, while rescuing a young peasant who was delivering a notice about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Luonan County, Shaanxi Province, he heroically sacrificed his life while fighting against the flood. This is a scene of Comrade Liang Zhenyou studying before his martyrdom.

"Our army is a people's army. It is an army for the people. It is an army for the people's interests." The service personnel of the conference office of a certain unit in the General Staff Department are loyal to Chairman Mao with all their hearts. They follow Chairman Mao closely and study Mao Zedong Thought with great urgency. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have made new contributions to the people. They say, "Every small progress in our thoughts and every achievement in our work are the results of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. The great leader Chairman Mao is our closest and dearest person." This is a plaque they embroidered with deep class feelings, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life.

"The People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force." The 626 Work Team of a certain unit in the General Staff Department, which has long been on duty in high-altitude areas, relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight decisively against cunning class enemies, adverse natural conditions, and the "self" in their minds. They have made new contributions in defending Chairman Mao, national defense, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Grasp the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness." The First Section of the Military Transportation Department of the General Staff Department, which has been a model unit for four consecutive years, has, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and have achieved double victories in revolution and work.

"There is no middle ground in the struggle between the two lines." The comrades of the Supply Section of the Management Bureau of the General Staff Department say, "With Mao Zedong Thought, we dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire!" In the great struggle between the two lines, they study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, use class analysis to distinguish between friends and enemies, unite the broad masses, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

"We must fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." Comrade Feng Hua of a certain unit in the General Staff Department has, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, used the "Three Articles" as a weapon, broken selfishness and established selflessness, and transformed her worldview. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, she does as Chairman Mao says and bravely defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

"We should all learn from his spirit of selflessness. From this point of view, one can become greatly beneficial to the people." The comrades of the General Staff Department, with the "Three Articles" as their motto, always compare themselves with the shining examples of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Loess Plateau, constantly break selfishness and establish selflessness, and transform their worldviews. The picture shows the representatives studying Chairman Mao's quotations in front of the statue of Norman Bethune while visiting the Norman Bethune Exhibition Hall.

"The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." Representatives attending the conference, such as Wang Shichan (second from the right) and Liu Shixi (third from the right), have, on the front lines of "Three Supports and Two Militaries," earnestly studied, enthusiastically propagated, firmly implemented, and bravely defended Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    中国人民解放军总参谋部广大指战员和职工、家属，在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席、党中央、中央军委、中央文革小组的领导下，在尖锐复杂的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，紧紧抓住了活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，突出一个“用”字，狠斗一个“私”字，大立一个“公”字。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的阶级深情，努力学习最新指示，忠实执行最新指示，热情宣传最新指示，勇敢捍卫最新指示，誓把总参谋部办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
　　“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”毛泽东思想哺育的好干部梁振友同志，是总参谋部干部的出色代表，是千千万万革命干部的学习榜样。他参军二十年来，心中时刻有一轮红太阳——我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，鼓舞着他全心全意为人民服务，当人民的忠实勤务员。一九六六年七月，在陕西省洛南县为抢救一名传送无产阶级文化大革命通知的农村青年，在与洪水搏斗中壮烈牺牲。这是梁振友同志生前学习的情景。

  “我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”总参谋部的同志，以“老三篇”为座右铭，时时处处用张思德、白求恩、老愚公这三个光辉形象对照检查自己，不断破私立公，改造世界观。图为代表们参观白求恩展览馆时，在白求恩像前学习毛主席《纪念白求恩》一文中的语录。
