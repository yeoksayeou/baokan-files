Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a proclamation on February 2, calling on personnel of the Saigon puppet regime and puppet soldiers to "take action with the people, defeat the U.S. aggressors, eliminate the diehard traitors, and save the country."

The proclamation states: "The U.S. bombing and shelling can destroy Vietnam's land and can devastate the crops growing on Vietnamese land, but it will never be able to subdue the indomitable spirit of the Vietnamese people, who have been tempered through four thousand years of trials and tribulations."

The proclamation further states: "The sole and highest goal of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is to save the country. The National Liberation Front aspires to establish an independent and sovereign South Vietnam, to build a peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and ultimately to reunify our beloved country of Vietnam."
