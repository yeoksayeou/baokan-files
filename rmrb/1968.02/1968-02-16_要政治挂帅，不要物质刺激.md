Title: Political Leadership, Not Material Incentives

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental change in the socio-economic system."

At every critical juncture in China's revolutionary history, the Chinese Khrushchev has emerged, with the full face of a traitor, advocating counter-revolutionary economism. He shouts about how "the development of economic struggle is the development of the Chinese labor movement," attempting to replace political struggle with "economic struggle" and thereby bury the people's revolution led by the proletariat.

During the period of socialist revolution, this fellow continues to promote counter-revolutionary economism as an important means of restoring capitalism in China.

Material incentives are a new manifestation of the counter-revolutionary economism that the Chinese Khrushchev has consistently promoted under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

The Chinese Khrushchev has a "theory of material distribution." He says that "the contradictions between enemies and us have been basically resolved" and that "internal contradictions among the people have become the main contradictions." He also says that "distribution relations that match the productive forces will promote the development of the productive forces," and that "if distribution is fair and reasonable, everyone will be satisfied, and this will promote the development of the productive forces." He says, "If you get more and I get less, no one will want to work, and the productive forces will be hindered."

According to the Chinese Khrushchev, in a socialist society, "the contradictions between enemies and us have been basically resolved," leaving only "internal contradictions among the people," and these "internal contradictions among the people" are originally "contradictions of material distribution." If material "distribution" is handled properly and reasonably, people's initiative will be high, and it will "promote the development of the productive forces."

This is the "theoretical basis" that the Chinese Khrushchev created for "material incentives."

The Chinese Khrushchev not only created a whole set of "material distribution" theories but also, together with his accomplices, created a whole set of "material distribution" systems. This first includes a very complex and varied set of reward systems. There are accident-free bonuses, comprehensive bonuses, single-item bonuses, monthly bonuses, year-end bonuses, and so on. In short, everything has a bonus, everything has money.

The Chinese Khrushchev is a capitalist running dog, a true believer in the "cult of money." He believes that in the world, only money is omnipotent, believing that "money can make the devil push the millstone." He thinks that by distributing a little money to the Chinese working class, he can blind the working class, making them detach from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, detach from the socialist revolutionary course pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao, and realize his dream of restoring capitalism.

The great proletarian cultural revolution has shattered the Chinese Khrushchev's dream of restoring capitalism in China. However, the Chinese Khrushchev's entire set of theories on material incentives and monetary bribery has not been completely exposed. As Lenin pointed out: "When the old society is dying, its corpse cannot be put into a coffin and buried. It rots and stinks among us and poisons us."

Material incentives are "stimulating" the selfishness of some people, "stimulating" some people to find ways to make money and seek profit at all costs. Ultimately, it is leading some people down the capitalist path.

Material incentives are using small favors and temporary benefits to try to lure the working class to forget about politics, forget about class struggle, forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, and create conditions for the restoration of capitalism in China.

Material incentives are attempting to corrupt and poison the working class with bourgeois ideology, opposing the arming of the Chinese working class with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, and it is the most powerful weapon against modern revisionism and imperialism. The counter-revolutionary revisionists are most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, afraid that revolutionary people will grasp Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they want to use material incentives to lure the Chinese working class and revolutionary people away from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

This is the wild dream of the Chinese Khrushchev!

Chinese Khrushchev, listen! We, the working class, warn you: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of the working class and revolutionary people, it is food, weapons, and the steering wheel, it is a spiritually powerful atomic bomb. Open the four volumes of treasure, and the light shines brightly before our eyes. The history of the Chinese revolution flashes by page by page: the sparks of revolution on Jinggangshan, Chairman Mao leading us to create the world's first red rural revolutionary base; crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands on the Long March, victorious arrival in Shaanxi; the War of Resistance Against Japan, with rice and rifles, defeating the ferocious Japanese imperialism; the War of Liberation, annihilating eight million Kuomintang troops in one stroke. All of this, what was it relying on? Was it money? Was it material incentives? No, it was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Over the past decade, we, the working class, have resolutely fought against and resolutely resisted the Chinese Khrushchev's set of "material incentives," demonstrating the Chinese working class's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This revolutionary spirit is unshakable by any monetary temptation. We, the working class, clearly recognize that following the path advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is very dangerous. If we go to the end, it will lead to the destruction of the party and the country, to the full restoration of capitalism in China, and to the end where we don't even know how we lost our heads.

Therefore, we must launch a mass revolutionary criticism to thoroughly expose the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary "material incentive" theory.

While thoroughly criticizing "material incentives," we must establish the worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people. Whether we operate machines, drive cars, smelt steel, cook, or sell tickets, all this work is not for money, but for revolution, for the victory of the Chinese revolution, for the victory of the world revolution, for the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world. We must never, never forget Chairman Mao's teachings to us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Forever and ever!

    要政治挂帅，不要物质刺激
    《北京工人》报编辑部
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”
    在中国历史上，每逢革命转变的关键时刻，中国赫鲁晓夫就跳了出来，以十足的工贼嘴脸，鼓吹反革命经济主义。他叫嚷什么“经济斗争之发展，即为中国职工运动之发展”，妄图以“经济斗争”来代替政治斗争，从而葬送无产阶级领导的人民革命。
    在社会主义革命时期，这个家伙继续推行反革命经济主义，作为他在中国复辟资本主义的一个重要手段。
    物质刺激，就是中国赫鲁晓夫一贯推行的反革命经济主义在无产阶级专政条件下的一种新的表现形式。
    中国赫鲁晓夫有个“物质分配”论。他说什么“敌我矛盾已经基本上解决”，“人民内部的矛盾已成为主要矛盾”；而“人民内部矛盾特别表现在分配问题上”。还说什么“分配关系适合生产力，就要促进生产力的发展”，“分配得比较公平合理，大家满意，就促进生产力的发展”，“你多分了，我少分了，大家不愿意干，生产力就受到阻碍”。
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，在社会主义社会中，“敌我矛盾已经基本上解决”，剩下的只有“人民内部的矛盾”了，而这个“人民内部的矛盾”，原来就是“物质分配”的矛盾。物质“分配”得妥善、合理，人的积极性就高，就能“促进”“生产力的发展”。
    这就是中国赫鲁晓夫给“物质刺激”制造的“理论根据”。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫不但造出来一整套“物质分配”的理论，而且和他的娄罗们一起，造出来一整套“物质分配”的制度。这首先就是那一大套非常复杂、花样繁多的奖励制度。什么无事故奖，什么综合奖，什么单项奖，什么月奖，什么年终奖，等等。一句话，凡事皆有奖，凡事都有钱。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是资产阶级的哈叭狗，是地地道道的“金钱拜物教”的信徒。他迷信世界上只有金钱是万能的，迷信“有钱能教鬼推磨”。他以为“分配”一点儿钱给中国工人阶级，就能迷住工人阶级的眼睛，使工人阶级脱离战无不胜的毛泽东思想，脱离伟大领袖毛主席指出的社会主义革命的航道，由他去实现复辟资本主义的美梦。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图在中国复辟资本主义的美梦。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫那一整套搞物质刺激、搞金钱收买的理论，还没有完全搞臭。正如列宁所指出的那样：“旧社会灭亡的时候，它的死尸是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们。”
    物质刺激，就是“刺激”一些人的自私自利的“积极性”，就是“刺激”一些人想方设法赚钱，唯利是图。归根结底，是引诱一些人去走资本主义的邪路。
    物质刺激，就是用小恩小惠，用眼前的一些暂时利益，企图引诱工人阶级忘掉政治，忘掉阶级斗争，忘掉无产阶级专政，造成在中国复辟资本主义的条件。
    物质刺激，就是企图用资产阶级思想来腐蚀和毒害工人阶级，反对用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装中国工人阶级。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是反对现代修正主义和帝国主义的最强大武器。反革命修正主义分子最害怕毛泽东思想，害怕革命人民掌握毛泽东思想。于是，他们想用物质来“刺激”、引诱中国工人阶级和革命人民脱离战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    这是中国赫鲁晓夫的痴心妄想！
    中国赫鲁晓夫，你听着，我们工人阶级正告你：战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是我们工人阶级和革命人民的命根子，是粮食、武器、方向盘，是威力无比的精神原子弹。翻开四卷宝书，眼前光芒万丈。中国革命的历史，一页一页闪过：井冈山上的星星之火，毛主席领导我们创造了世界上第一个红色农村革命根据地；长征路上，爬雪山，过草地，胜利到达陕北；抗日战争，小米加步枪，战胜了凶恶的日本帝国主义；解放战争，一举消灭了八百万蒋介石军队。这一切一切都是靠什么？靠的是钱吗？靠的是物质刺激吗？都不是。靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    过去十几年里，我们工人阶级对中国赫鲁晓夫搞的那一套“物质刺激”，进行了坚决的斗争和坚决的抵制，表现了中国工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命气节。这种革命气节是任何金钱引诱都动摇不了的。我们工人阶级清楚地认识到，沿着中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的道路走下去，是很危险的，走到最后，就会亡党亡国，就会在中国全面复辟资本主义，就会最后掉了脑袋都不知道怎样掉的。
    因此，必须对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命“物质刺激”论展开群众性的革命大批判，彻底把它搞臭。
    在大破“物质刺激”的同时，我们要大立全心全意为人民服务的世界观。我们不论开机器、开车、炼钢，还是做饭、售票，这一切工作都不是为了钱，而是干革命，是为了中国革命的胜利，是为了世界革命的胜利，是为了战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界获得胜利。我们永远永远不能忘记毛主席教导我们的这几个金光闪闪的大字：政治是统帅，是灵魂。直至千秋万代，千秋万代！
