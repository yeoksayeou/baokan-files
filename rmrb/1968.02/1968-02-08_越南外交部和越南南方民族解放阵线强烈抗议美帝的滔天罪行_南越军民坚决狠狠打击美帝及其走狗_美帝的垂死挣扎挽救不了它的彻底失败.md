	New China News Agency, Hanoi, February 6 – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 5, strongly condemning the atrocities committed by American imperialism and its lackeys in their desperate struggles. Since January 31, they have used aircraft, artillery, and poison gas to massacre the people of Saigon, Hue, My Tho, and other cities in South Vietnam. The statement points out: This is a new and extremely horrifying crime committed by the United States and its lackeys in South Vietnam, a blatant provocation against world opinion.

	The statement points out: At present, the American aggressors and their lackeys are facing the thunderous strikes of the people of South Vietnam. No matter how crazy and barbaric their actions are, they cannot escape their obvious failure in South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam will resolutely advance and will surely give American imperialism and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique the deserved punitive blows.

	The statement concludes that the American aggressors will inevitably fail, and the Vietnamese people will surely achieve complete victory.

	The statement says: After suffering heavy defeats on various battlefields in South Vietnam recently, American imperialism and its lackeys have taken extremely brutal measures, using aircraft, tanks, and artillery to indiscriminately bomb and shell densely populated areas and temples in Saigon-Cholon, Hue, Pleiku, My Tho, and many other towns in South Vietnam, killing a large number of people, monks, and believers, and burning down a large number of houses. The puppet group of the United States is also preparing to illegally try and kill a large number of patriots in the South.

	The statement says: This is a new and extremely barbaric crime of inhuman American imperialism and its lackeys, a crime that progressive humanity cannot forgive.

The statement sternly warns American imperialism and its lackeys: It is no longer a time when aggressors and traitors can act with impunity.

No matter how brutal the methods and evil plots of American imperialism and its lackeys, they cannot save themselves from their complete failure.

	The statement says: The military and people of South Vietnam will resolutely advance, launch continuous attacks, and are determined to give the American bandits and their lackeys the deserved punishment, and ultimately achieve complete victory.
