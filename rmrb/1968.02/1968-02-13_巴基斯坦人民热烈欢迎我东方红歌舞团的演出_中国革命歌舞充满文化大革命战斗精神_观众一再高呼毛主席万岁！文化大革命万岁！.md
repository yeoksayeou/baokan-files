The Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe held its first performance in the Pakistani capital of Rawalpindi on the evening of February 7. The revolutionary songs and dances performed by the Chinese cultural warriors were enthusiastically received by the audience. During the dance performance of "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman at the Helm," when the golden, shining portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the audience burst into thunderous applause, and the entire audience reached a climax of excitement.

Pakistan's Central Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Khawaja Shahabuddin, said in his speech at the opening ceremony: "The Pakistani government and people admire the outstanding achievements of the Chinese people under the inspiring leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong."

He said that the visit of the Chinese song and dance troupe marks the harmonious and friendly relations between the two countries, and this friendly connection between the two countries will be further strengthened.

The Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, Xu Ying, said in his speech that the Chinese people, tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, will further support the Pakistani people's struggle against foreign aggression and support the struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination.

Before arriving in Rawalpindi on February 7, the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe performed in Karachi and Peshawar, both of which were warmly received.

A teacher from Peshawar University, after watching the performance, excitedly told the members of the song and dance troupe: "Chairman Mao said: 'To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. But having only this kind of army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy.' Now, I have seen with my own eyes the Chinese cultural army guided by Mao Zedong Thought. This army not only inspires the Chinese people but also inspires the people of foreign countries, especially the people of Asia and Africa, in their struggle against the common enemy."

The Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe held its first revolutionary song and dance performance in the evening of February 10 in Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan, amidst sustained and enthusiastic applause. The troupe performed revolutionary dances such as "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman at the Helm," "We Are the Red Guards of Chairman Mao," and "Celebrating the Establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee," as well as revolutionary songs like "We Stand with Our Vietnamese Brothers." The audience repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long Live the Cultural Revolution!" "Long Live the Red Guards!" They also shouted slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism!" "Get out of Vietnam, American Imperialists!"

The Lahore newspapers warmly praised the performance of the Chinese song and dance troupe. A famous art critic wrote that the performance of the Chinese song and dance troupe was full of the fighting spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
