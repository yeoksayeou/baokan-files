Editor's Note: The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army Railway Corps have endured great hardships and toiled tirelessly, braving wind and snow, scorching heat, dense forests, and high plateaus to build roads and bridges. What is the source of all this? It is the emphasis on proletarian politics and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. With Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, we can promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, establish a worldview of communism that is dedicated to the public, to the revolution, and to the people, and fully mobilize people's revolutionary enthusiasm, transforming it into a great material force. We can have a heart for the motherland and an eye on the world, be self-reliant and strive for hardship, fearing neither hardship nor death. We can surge with boundless enthusiasm and trample all difficulties underfoot. Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, the bravest, and have the greatest fighting spirit.

Emphasizing proletarian politics is the core of Chairman Mao's military line and the direction for building a proletarian revolutionary army. Some representatives from the second conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Railway Corps shared their personal experiences and criticized the fallacies of Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Rongsheng, who opposed emphasizing politics. Their articles tell us that the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who are loyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought, have resolutely resisted and eliminated the bourgeois military line, and have steadfastly followed the path of emphasizing politics. As long as we always adhere to the proletarian political direction and place the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, we will forever stand unshakable.

Forever Advance Along Chairman Mao's Military Line

		Yang Liandi, Former Political Instructor of the Unit

Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Rongsheng have always opposed emphasizing politics and advocated "technology first." They even proposed the fallacious compromise of "emphasizing politics should be implemented in engineering" and "engineering is politics."

On the issue of emphasizing politics versus emphasizing technology, we have had profound lessons. When our unit was tasked with constructing a certain large bridge, it was during the time when the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Rongsheng was vigorously promoting "technology first." To compete for progress, they organized activities like "engineering competitions," causing cadres to be busy with "counting heads," "counting days," and "counting stones," neglecting the study of Chairman Mao's works and undermining political work. The party branch felt that this approach did not align with Chairman Mao's teachings. Therefore, they organized the entire unit to study the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the expanded meeting of the Military Commission, and conducted a major discussion: Should we emphasize politics or engineering? What kind of unit should we build? Through the discussion, everyone realized: Our army is the people's army created by Chairman Mao. Emphasizing politics is the core of Chairman Mao's military thought and the fundamental guarantee for our army to defeat any enemy and remain uncorrupted. The so-called "engineering is politics" and the like are all clichés of bourgeois military views. From then on, we firmly emphasized politics and focused on the revolutionization of people's thinking. No matter how busy the construction was, we always placed the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. We resolutely resisted any behavior that undermined politics and the study of Chairman Mao's works.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Rongsheng saw that the entire unit, including all cadres and soldiers, did not listen to his nonsense and viciously pressured us to pursue "technological first" so-called "hard work."

We resolutely reject "technological first" hard work. We want to be strong in studying Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and implementing Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on the four firsts. At that time, the *Liberation Army Daily* launched a discussion on "where to implement emphasizing politics," and cadres and soldiers wrote articles criticizing the fallacy of "emphasizing politics should be implemented in engineering." We deeply understood that the true strength of the unit lies in being able to stand firm in the face of storms and waves, discern right from wrong, and remain loyal to the cause of communism, the party, the people, and the great leader Chairman Mao and his proletarian revolutionary line.

Emphasizing proletarian politics is invincible. In 1967, our unit was tasked with bridge construction and used new technology for pile driving. The party branch first firmly believed that as long as Mao Zedong Thought armed the minds of cadres and soldiers, there would be no difficulties that could not be overcome. In the construction, we focused on the revolutionization of people's thinking, firmly established the idea of "completely" and "thoroughly" working for the people, and led everyone to deeply study Chairman Mao's *On Practice*, emphasizing repeated practice and daring to practice. We achieved meticulous design and construction, extreme responsibility, and perfection. Comrades carried out technological innovations, completing the entire bridge foundation concrete pouring task 25 days ahead of schedule. This is the victory of emphasizing politics and adhering to the four firsts, and the great defeat of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacy of "technology first."

It is precisely because we have adhered to the path of emphasizing politics that we have been evaluated as a model unit for seven consecutive years. The facts tell us: Emphasizing politics and arming the mind with Mao Zedong Thought can unleash people's high enthusiasm and initiative, and ensure that we always stand unshakable. We will ride the wind and waves, forever advancing along Chairman Mao's military line with great courage.

专栏：

    编者按：人民解放军铁道兵的广大指战员，为了革命的利益、人民的利益而吃大苦，耐大劳，顶风雪，冒酷暑，战林海，征高原，开山修路，跨水架桥。这一切靠的是什么？靠突出无产阶级政治，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，确立一心为公，一心为革命，一心为人民的共产主义世界观，就能使人的革命积极性充分调动起来，从而变成巨大的物质力量；就能胸怀祖国，放眼世界，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，一不怕苦，二不怕死；就能冲天干劲涌出来，千难万难脚下踩。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最聪明，最勇敢，有最大的战斗力。
    突出无产阶级政治，是毛主席建军路线的核心，是建设无产阶级革命军队的方向。铁道兵第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的部分代表联系他们的切身体会，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿反对突出政治的谬论。他们的文章告诉我们，无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的人民解放军广大指战员，坚决抵制和破除了资产阶级军事路线，坚定不移地走突出政治的道路。只要时时处处坚持无产阶级政治方向，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位，用毛泽东思想去统帅一切，我们就能永远立于不败之地。
    永远沿着毛主席的建军路线前进
    杨连第生前所在连指导员　朱圣尧
    中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，一贯反对突出政治，鼓吹“技术第一”。他们还曾提出“突出政治要落实到工程”，“工程就是政治”的折衷主义谬论。
    在突出政治还是突出技术的问题上，我们有过很深刻的教训。我们连担任某大桥施工任务时，正是反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿大搞“技术第一”的时候。为了比进度，大搞什么“工程大比武”的活动，使得干部成天忙于“抓人头”、“抓日头”、“抓石头”，放松了毛主席著作的学习，冲击了政治工作。党支部感到这样做不符合毛主席的教导，于是在全连组织学习古田会议决议、军委扩大会议决议，开展一次大讨论：究竟是突出政治还是突出工程？究竟要建设一个什么样的连队？通过讨论，大家认识到：我军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，突出政治是毛主席建军思想的核心，是保证我军能战胜任何敌人，永不变质的根本。所谓“工程就是政治”等等完全是资产阶级军事观点的滥调。从此，我们坚定不移地突出政治，狠抓人的思想革命化，不管施工多么紧张，总是把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。对于一切冲击政治、冲击学习毛主席著作的行为，都坚决加以抵制。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿看到我们这个英雄杨连第生前所在连队的全体干部、战士不听他那一套，便穷凶极恶地给我们施加压力，要我们搞“技术第一”的所谓“过硬”。
    我们坚决不要“技术第一”的过硬，我们要在学习毛泽东思想，促进人的思想革命化上过硬，在落实林副主席关于四个第一的指示上过硬。当时，《解放军报》开展了“突出政治落实到那里”的讨论，干部、战士纷纷写稿批判“突出政治要落实到工程”的谬论。我们深深懂得，连队真正的过硬，是在大风大浪里能站稳立场，分清大是大非，永远忠于共产主义事业，忠于党，忠于人民，忠于伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    突出无产阶级政治无往而不胜。一九六七年我们连担任桥梁施工任务，采用新技术打桩。党支部首先坚信只要用毛泽东思想武装干部、战士的头脑，就没有克服不了的困难。我们在施工中，狠抓人的思想革命化，大立“完全”“彻底”为人民施工的思想，并且领导大家深入学习毛主席《实践论》中反复实践、敢于实践的思想，做到精心设计、精心施工，极端负责，精益求精。同志们大搞技术革新，使整个桥基混凝土灌注任务提前二十五天完成。这是突出政治、坚持四个第一的胜利，是中国赫鲁晓夫“技术第一”反动谬论的大破产。
    我们正是由于坚持走突出政治的路，七年来连续被评为四好连队。事实告诉我们：突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，才能发挥人的高度积极性和主动性，才能永远立于不败之地。我们要乘风破浪，永远沿着毛主席的建军路线奋勇前进。
