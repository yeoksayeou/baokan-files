In the midst of U.S. imperialist leader Johnson's frantic travels from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States to boost the morale of the cannon fodder he sent to South Vietnam, news from the South Vietnamese battlefield has once again reported that the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people have launched widespread attacks on cities and towns controlled by the U.S. puppets, as well as American invasion bases and facilities, achieving significant victories. This has forced the frightened Johnson to wail to the batches of American soldiers forced to fight in South Vietnam: the situation in South Vietnam is "extremely serious," and the United States must "make more sacrifices."

In the face of increasing casualties and plummeting morale among the invading U.S. forces, Johnson, on the 17th and 18th, rushed from the U.S. military base in North Carolina on the East Coast to the Marine Corps camp in California on the West Coast to "see off" the additional troops sent to South Vietnam. His intention was to win hearts and minds and boost morale. However, at the same time, urgent reports from the invading U.S. forces in South Vietnam flooded Johnson's desk. In his speech, Johnson, on one hand, feigned pity and begged "God" to protect these cannon fodder from harm, but on the other hand, he had to admit that they would face "more difficult and arduous" "responsibilities" and "deadly challenges" in South Vietnam. The Associated Press reported that Johnson "was mostly gloomy, and so were the soldiers."

According to reports, after Johnson said goodbye to some of the U.S. reinforcement troops on the 18th, he held a press conference where he stated that the United States planned to further increase troops in South Vietnam to reverse the deteriorating situation. He shouted: "We will continue to support them—to give (the U.S. commander in South Vietnam) everything they ask for, and anything they might ask for," and if necessary, he would raise the previously set limit of increasing troops in South Vietnam to 525,000 by the first half of this year. Meanwhile, there are reports that the Johnson administration "is considering calling up more reserve forces... to offset the reduction in strategic reserve personnel." According to recent revelations by U.S. newspapers, the current strategic reserve forces of the United States have been depleted to such an extent that after sending an additional 10,500 troops to South Vietnam, the U.S. Army "does not even have a complete infantry division ready for immediate deployment overseas."

    南越军民第二次强大攻势打得美帝鬼哭狼嚎
    约翰逊惊呼南越局势“非常严重”
    新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：在美帝国主义头子约翰逊正从美国东海岸跑到西海岸，为增派到南越去的炮灰打气的时候，从南越战场上又传出了南方人民解放武装力量再次对美伪控制下的城镇及美国侵略军基地、设施发起广泛袭击，并取得重大战果的消息，这就使得惊魂未定的约翰逊不得不哭丧着脸对着一批批被迫去南越卖命的美军士兵哀号：南越局势“非常严重”，美国必须“作出更多牺牲”。
    在侵越美军伤亡激增、士气急剧低落的情况下，约翰逊在十七日和十八日，从东海岸的北卡罗来纳州的美军基地，奔到西海岸的加利福尼亚州海军陆战队的兵营，为增派到南越去的美军“送行”，本来是为了笼络人心，鼓舞一下士气。然而就在这同时，侵越美军告急的电报雪片般地传到约翰逊眼前。约翰逊在讲话中，一方面假慈假悲地哀告“上帝”保佑这批炮灰“平安无事”，另方面不得不承认，他们在南越将面临“更困难、更艰巨”的“责任”和“致命的挑战”。美联社在消息中报道说，约翰逊“在大部分时间里是愁容满面的，士兵们也是如此”。
    据报道，约翰逊十八日在同一些美军增援部队“告别”后举行的一次记者招待会上表示，美国打算进一步增兵南越来挽救败局。他叫嚷：“我们将尽力支持下去——给予（侵越美军头目）要求的一切，以及可能要求的一切”，“如果需要的话”，他将提高原定在今年上半年内把侵越兵力增加到五十二万五千人的这一限额。与此同时，有消息说，约翰逊政府“正在考虑征召更多的预备役部队……以抵销战略后备队人数的减少”。据美国报纸最近透露，目前，美国战略后备力量已经枯竭到这种程度：在这次增派一万零五百人去南越后，现在美国陆军“甚至没有一个完整的步兵师准备好供立即调往海外之用”。
