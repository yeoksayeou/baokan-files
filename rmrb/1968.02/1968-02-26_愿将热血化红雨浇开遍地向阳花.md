	May our hot blood turn into red rain to bloom sunflowers everywhere
	Deputy political instructor of a certain unit: Wang Kejing
	Platoon leader: Liang Zhaonian

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit. It will press on to overcome all enemies and will never be subdued by any enemy. No matter how difficult and dangerous the circumstances, as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight on."

	However, the Chinese Khrushchev maliciously says, "A good commander in battle, when speaking, only allows for victory and does not allow for retreat, but in his heart, he has a plan, that if defeated, he will still 'run away.' This is a roundabout way of spreading the bourgeois 'philosophy of survival.'"

	Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are all selfless and fearless heroes, each one a towering figure. In the critical moments of battle, they have only the spirit to fight to the death with the enemy, with no thought of retreat or surrender. Our revolutionary soldiers under Chairman Mao, no matter when or under what difficult circumstances, are always guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Even if our heads are severed and our blood flows, our resolve will not waver. Even if our bodies are crushed, our hearts will not change. While we live, we will be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao; even in sacrifice, we will leave behind a heart infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. For the liberation of the oppressed people, we dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. Sacrifice is of no concern; as long as our loyalty remains, we will defend Chairman Mao. Even in death, we will be content. For the sake of defending Chairman Mao, for the sake of defending Mao Zedong Thought, and for the sake of the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, to shed blood and make sacrifices is our most magnificent aspiration and honor. May our hot blood turn into red rain to bloom sunflowers everywhere. This is our view on life and death, the revolutionary view on life and death of the proletariat. Let the Chinese Khrushchev's 'philosophy of survival' go to hell!

    愿将热血化红雨浇开遍地向阳花
    某部副指导员　王克京　排长　梁召年
    毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“一个好的指挥官在作战时，口里讲的只准打胜仗，不准后退，其实心里有个打算，万一打败了，还不是要‘开溜’。”这是转弯抹角地宣传资产阶级“活命哲学”。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，人人是无私无畏的好汉，个个是顶天立地的英雄。他们在战斗的危急关头，只有同敌人血战到底的气概，绝无畏缩逃跑的私心。我们毛主席的革命战士，无论在什么时候，在任何艰难困苦的情况下，都是用毛泽东思想统帅自己的。头断血流志不移，粉身碎骨心不变。我们活着，要无限忠于毛主席；我们牺牲，也要留颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。为了被压迫人民的解放事业，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，牺牲不要紧，留得忠心在，保卫毛主席，死了也甘心。为了保卫毛主席，为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了无产阶级的革命事业而流血牺牲，这是我们最宏伟的志愿和荣誉。愿将热血化红雨，浇开遍地向阳花。这就是我们的生死观，是无产阶级的革命的生死观。让中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”见鬼去吧！
