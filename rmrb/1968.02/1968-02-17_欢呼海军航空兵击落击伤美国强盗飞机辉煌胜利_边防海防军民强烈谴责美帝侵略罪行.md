People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers who have been guarding the southwestern border and the southeastern coast day and night, along with local revolutionary masses, have been holding meetings in recent days to enthusiastically celebrate the Navy Air Force's victory of shooting down and damaging one intruding American aircraft each. They also strongly condemn the heinous crimes of American imperialism in escalating the Vietnam War and repeatedly provoking war against China.

Military and civilian personnel unanimously declared: We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are also ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade, to defend the motherland, support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and contribute to the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression.

The news reached the soldiers and revolutionary masses at the border of Yunnan and the plateau of Tibet, who were overjoyed and clapped their hands in delight. They pointed out at the celebration meetings that the heroic Navy Air Force shot down and damaged one intruding American aggressor aircraft each on the 14th, giving a lesson to the American imperialists who have been provoking war against China and supporting the Vietnamese comrades in the south who are sweeping away the American puppet army with an irresistible force. This is a great achievement of the Navy Air Force in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and emphasizing proletarian politics.

In Hekou Yao Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, which is across the river from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the soldiers and revolutionary masses expressed their determination to learn from the Navy Air Force, fully implement the latest instructions of Chairman Mao, and build the border of the motherland into an iron wall. They vowed to be a strong support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. The soldiers and revolutionary masses guarding the border at Friendship Pass sternly warned the American imperialists: The seven hundred million Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are fully prepared and on high alert. If the American aggressors dare to expand the Vietnam War and impose it on the Chinese people, we will, like the Navy Air Force, follow the teachings of Chairman Mao and "exert all our strength to annihilate the invading enemy."

The news reached the front lines in Fujian and the coastal regions of Shanghai, Guangdong, and Zhejiang. From the frontline outposts to the artillery positions, from the air force bases to the naval docks, from the barracks to the fishing villages on the islands, there were shouts of "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The soldiers and officers stationed on Nanri Island and Huangqi Peninsula in Fujian Province, along with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the area, held military-civilian celebration meetings and discussions. The "Sea Tigers" that strike fear into the hearts of the enemy and the soldiers and officers stationed at the forefront in the South China Sea, as well as the crew members of the "South Sea Hero Ship," after hearing the good news, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggle." They all expressed their determination to heighten their vigilance, strengthen their preparedness, and be ready at any time to smash all war provocations by American imperialism and its running dogs.
