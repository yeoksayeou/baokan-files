Recent news from Asia regarding Vietnam has been clear enough to make Washington uncomfortable. Simply put, the "quagmire" is deeper than any high-ranking official has been willing to admit in the past.

Based on Johnson's current policy, doubling the number of American troops in Asia is being considered. However, there is no guarantee that one million American troops in Vietnam would perform better than the current fifty thousand.

Johnson has decided to quickly dispatch an additional ten thousand and five hundred soldiers and marines to South Vietnam, which has significantly reduced the already strained strategic reserve forces in the U.S.

If another emergency occurs outside of Vietnam, the army does not even have a complete infantry division that can be immediately deployed overseas.

Military officials believe that the strategic reserve forces on active duty have been reduced to such an extent that Johnson may soon have to order limited mobilization, or take drastic measures such as forcibly extending the terms of military personnel. ... One officer said: "We have reached the breaking point before, but this time we have surpassed it."

    枯竭的兵力
    最近那些从亚洲传来的有关越南的消息都是够清楚的，使华盛顿没法感到舒服。很简单，“泥坑”的深度超过任何高级官员过去愿意承认的程度。
    根据约翰逊的现行政策来推论，把驻亚洲的美军兵力增加一倍。但是，没法打保票说一百万美军在越南能比现在的五十万人干得好些。

    约翰逊决定赶紧增派一万零五百名陆军和海军陆战队到南越，已严重地减少了美国已经是很紧张的服现役的、战略后备师。
    如果在越南之外发生另一起紧急事件，陆军甚至没有一个完整的步兵师能够供立即调往海外之用。
    军方人士认为，服现役的战略后备力量已经减少到这种地步，以致约翰逊不久可能必须下令实行有限动员，或者对军事人员采取例如强制延长入伍期限这类激烈行动。……一个军官说：“我们以前到了破裂点，但是这一次已经超过了那一点。”
