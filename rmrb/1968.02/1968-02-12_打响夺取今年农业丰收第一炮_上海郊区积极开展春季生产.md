Shanghai's suburban areas are actively carrying out spring production, with a high level of revolutionary enthusiasm, to fire the first shot in seizing this year's comprehensive agricultural harvest.

In recent times, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai's suburban areas have further seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have swiftly launched a new high tide to consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. In counties where revolutionary committees have already been established, the revolutionary three-in-one combination has been further improved; in some counties where revolutionary great alliances had not yet been achieved, they have swiftly realized revolutionary great alliances and are actively preparing to establish revolutionary committees.

Under the impetus of this excellent revolutionary situation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have concentrated their efforts to launch the spring production movement. They believe that to grasp spring production, the most important thing, the most crucial thing, is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production. Many communes and production brigades have recently held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasping revolution and promoting production," deepening their understanding of the great significance of doing a good job in spring production. Some counties have also held three-level cadre meetings with representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants participating, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and reviewing the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in rural people's communes across the country last spring. This has further inspired the broad masses to seize double victories in revolution and production. Currently, the suburban rural areas have seen a spring production movement centered on fertilizer accumulation and plowing, and field management of summer crops. Although the temperature in Shanghai's suburban areas is still below zero, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's teachings, fear no hardships and bravely fight against the cold. Members of the seventh production brigade in the Republic Production Brigade of Tangwan Commune in Shanghai County braved the cold and spent four days carting river water, breaking through the frozen soil, and carrying enough river mud for twenty-five mu of wheat fields. The sixth production brigade organized a shock team, which successively rushed to carry river mud during low tide for over ninety mu and applied mud to over thirty mu.

In the spring production movement, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai's suburban areas have responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," thoroughly criticized the poison of revisionism spread by Liu Shaoqi's agents Chen Pi-xian and Cao Qi-qiu in the suburban areas, and established the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. This year, Xuxiang Commune in Jiading County plans to increase the area of double-cropping rice compared to last year to expand grain production. Therefore, there is a shortage of fertilizer, and some cadres and commune members have developed a sense of difficulty. After learning from the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle of Dazhai Brigade, they immediately took action, carried river mud, produced farmyard manure, and transported various fertilizers to the city, effectively solving the base fertilizer problem for growing rice and cotton. During the spring production, cadres from Shanghai's cities, counties, and communes have all brought Chairman Mao's works, gone deep into the production front lines, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's teachings, grasped revolution, and promoted production, which has been warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    打响夺取今年农业丰收第一炮
    上海郊区积极开展春季生产
    新华社上海十一日电　上海郊区广大贫下中农和革命干部正以高涨的革命热情，掀起春季生产运动，为夺取今年农业的全面丰收打响第一炮。
    上海郊区贫下中农和革命干部，近一个时期以来，进一步认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，迅速掀起了巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合的新高潮。已经建立革命委员会的县，革命的三结合得到了进一步的完善；一些原来还没有实现革命大联合的县，也迅速实现了革命的大联合，并积极筹建革命委员会。
    在大好革命形势的推动下，广大贫下中农集中力量开展了春季生产运动。他们认为，要抓好春季生产，千重要，万重要，最重要的是要用毛泽东思想来统帅生产。许多社、队最近普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，加深对搞好春季生产的重大意义的认识。有一些县还召开了有贫下中农代表参加的三级干部会议，学习毛主席的最新指示，又重温了去年春季中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信，更加激发了广大群众夺取革命、生产双胜利的革命豪情。目前，郊区农村已出现了一个以积肥备耕和夏熟作物田间管理为中心的春季大生产运动。上海郊区目前气温还在零度以下，但是广大贫下中农遵照毛主席的教导，不怕困难，英勇地与天寒地冻战斗。上海县塘湾公社共和大队第七生产队社员冒着严寒，花了四天时间，车干了河水，敲开了冰土，挑足了二十五亩麦田的河泥。第六生产队组织突击队，先后抢挑落潮河泥九十多亩，捻泥三十多亩。
    在春季大生产运动中，上海郊区广大贫下中农和革命干部，响应伟大领袖毛主席“农业学大寨”的号召，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流在郊区散布的修正主义流毒，树立了自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神。嘉定县徐行公社今年为了扩大粮食生产，计划种植的双季稻面积比去年增加，因此肥料感到不足，有些干部、社员产生了畏难情绪。经过学习大寨大队自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神，他们立即行动起来，挑河泥，出家肥，到城市运杂肥，有效地解决了种水稻、棉花的基肥问题。在春季大生产中，上海的市、县和公社的干部，纷纷带着毛主席著作，深入生产第一线，和贫下中农一起学习毛主席的教导，一起抓革命、促生产，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
