In the favorable situation of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Changsha City Workers' Congress of Hunan Province was formally established on February 21. This is another major achievement in the Changsha working class's full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This is a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The working class of Changsha, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has played a leading role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the revolution, the Changsha working class has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, stood firmly at the forefront of the struggle, united with the broad revolutionary masses, and waged a heroic battle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in Hunan and Changsha, making significant contributions.

From February 17 to 21, the working class of Changsha held its first representative congress. At the meeting, worker representatives gathered to exchange experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the focus on "criticizing the self and criticizing revisionism." The meeting decided to establish the Changsha City Workers' Congress to further strengthen the construction of the Changsha working class with the great Mao Zedong Thought, advancing towards the goal of being highly proletarian and highly combative. On February 21, more than 200,000 revolutionary workers and revolutionary masses in Changsha held a grand rally to celebrate the establishment of the Workers' Congress. Revolutionary workers and revolutionary masses, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, sang "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They surged towards Dongfeng Square.

The celebration began with the music of "The East is Red." Li Yuan spoke at the celebration, warmly congratulating the birth of the Changsha City Workers' Congress and hoping that the working class of Changsha would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation within the unit, vigorously promote revolution, and vigorously promote production, making new achievements in the great struggle for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The responsible person of the Changsha City Workers' Congress said at the meeting, "The victories we have achieved are only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. The tasks ahead are even more glorious, arduous, and great. We will definitely raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and together with the revolutionary people of the entire province, strive to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization."
