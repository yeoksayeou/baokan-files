The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam have launched a powerful offensive against the enemy since the New Year, fearing no fatigue and fighting continuously, striking the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, and achieving brilliant results. According to a communiqué issued by the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, in the nearly thirty days of fighting since January 29, the South Vietnamese military and civilian people have annihilated more than 90,000 enemy troops, including over 20,000 American and puppet troops. All the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world are overjoyed and applaud the great victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian people!

The powerful offensive launched by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam since the New Year has opened a new chapter in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. This great victory has disrupted the strategic deployment of American imperialism in South Vietnam, greatly shaken the reactionary rule of the U.S. puppets in major cities, thoroughly smashed the "pacification" plan of the U.S. puppets in rural areas, and annihilated a large number of the enemy's fighting forces, dealing a heavy blow to the American aggressors. American imperialism has fallen into an unprecedentedly embarrassing situation in the Vietnam War.

Today, on the battlefield of South Vietnam, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam firmly grasp the initiative of the war. They not only can launch comprehensive attacks but also can conduct continuous offensives, launching one powerful offensive after another against the enemy in a short period. The American aggressors are in an even more passive position of being beaten up on the battlefield of South Vietnam, gradually losing their freedom of action.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out during the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan: "Our war is to strive for victory in every battle, big or small, to strive to disarm the enemy in every battle, and to inflict losses on the enemy's troops and equipment. Accumulating these partial victories over the enemy into a great strategic victory, achieving the political goal of driving the enemy out of the country, defending the motherland, and building a new China."

The most important feature of the New Year offensive of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam is the combination of military and civilian forces, annihilating a large number of the enemy's fighting forces. In less than thirty days, they annihilated more than 90,000 enemy troops, which is an unprecedented great victory for the people of South Vietnam. In the past seven years, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have continuously annihilated the enemy, totaling over 1.5 million, including over 300,000 American aggressors and puppet troops. The people of South Vietnam have been able to wage a protracted war, in addition to their absolute political advantage, the main military means is to annihilate the enemy's fighting forces to long-term wear down the enemy. In the early stages of the war of resistance against American aggression, it was often the accumulation of small victories into big victories. As the war situation developed, the victories of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam became greater and greater, and the number of enemy troops annihilated in each battle or campaign also became larger and larger. One can fully imagine that if the enemy's fighting forces are continuously annihilated in this way, the American aggressors, who are already short of troops and facing numerous difficulties, will not be able to sustain themselves in South Vietnam for long. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam will definitely be able to achieve greater strategic victories through such continuous victories, achieving the sacred goal of driving the enemy out of the country, liberating the entire territory, and ultimately unifying the motherland.

Facing the defeat in the Vietnam War, the American aggressors are hastening to take a series of measures to expand the war. In addition to sending more than 10,000 cannon fodder to the battlefield in South Vietnam for emergency reinforcement, the Johnson administration is also actively considering calling up reserve personnel. The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Wheeler, also rushed to Saigon to plot further military adventures. It is clear that American imperialism will not give up without a fight, and the closer it gets to final defeat, the more desperately it will struggle.

However, no matter how much American imperialism bets in the Vietnam War, it will not be able to escape its ultimate failure in Vietnam. The Vietnamese people have already made up their minds to wage a protracted war, to carry the war of resistance against American aggression to the end, until they achieve the final victory. The 700 million Chinese people firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, driving the American aggressors out of Vietnam, not leaving a single one behind!

    不断歼灭敌人，夺取更大胜利
    本报评论员
    英雄的越南南方军民，新春以来，向敌人发动强大攻势，不怕疲劳，连续作战，不断打击美国侵略者及其走狗，取得了辉煌战果。据越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部发表的公报，南越军民在一月二十九日以来的近三十天战斗中，共歼灭敌人九万多名，其中包括美军和帮凶军二万多。全中国人民和全世界革命人民对南越军民的伟大胜利无不欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快！
    越南南方军民新春以来的强大攻势，为越南人民抗美救国战争打开了一个新的局面。这一伟大的胜利，打乱了美帝国主义在南越的战略部署，极大地动摇了美伪在主要城镇的反动统治，彻底粉碎了美伪在农村地区的“绥靖”计划，大量地歼灭了敌人的有生力量，给了美国侵略者以十分沉重的打击。美帝国主义在侵越战争中陷入了空前狼狈的困境。
    在今天的南越战场上，越南南方军民牢牢地掌握着战争的主动权。他们不仅能够全面出击，而且能够连续进攻，在短时间内向敌人发动一次又一次的强大攻势。美国侵略者在南越战场上已经处于更加被动挨打的地位，越来越失去了行动的自由权。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在中国人民抗日战争期间曾经指出：“我们的战争，在于力求每战争取不论大小的胜利，在于力求每战解除敌人一部分武装，损伤敌人一部分人马器物。把这些部分地消灭敌人的成绩积累起来，成为大的战略胜利，达到最后驱敌出国，保卫祖国，建设新中国的政治目的。”
    越南南方军民新春攻势的最重要的一个特点，就是军民结合，大量歼灭美伪军的有生力量。不到三十天时间，歼敌九万多，这是越南南方人民空前巨大的胜利。过去七年中，越南南方人民解放武装力量不断地歼灭敌军，总数达到一百五十多万，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军三十多万人。越南南方人民所以能够进行持久战，除了发挥政治上的绝对优势以外，在军事上的主要手段就是用歼灭敌人的有生力量来长期消耗敌人。在抗美救国战争的初期，往往是积小胜为大胜。而随着战争形势的发展，越南南方军民的胜利越来越大，每次战斗或战役歼灭敌人的数字也越来越大。人们完全可以设想，如果按照这样不断地歼灭敌人有生力量，本来已经兵力不足、困难重重的美国侵略者，是无法长久地在南越支撑下去的。越南南方军民通过这样持续不断的胜利的积累，必定能够造成更大的战略胜利，以达到驱敌出国，解放全部国土、进而统一祖国的神圣目标。
    面对着侵越战争的败局，美国侵略者正在加紧采取一系列扩大战争的措施。约翰逊政府除了把一万多名炮灰派到南越战场紧急增援而外，还积极酝酿征召后备役人员。美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒也赶到西贡去策划进一步扩大军事冒险。事情很清楚，美帝国主义是不见棺材不落泪的，它越接近最后失败，就越要进行疯狂的挣扎。
    但是，美帝国主义不论在侵越战争中再投下多大赌注，也决不能逃脱它在越南彻底失败的命运。越南人民早已下定决心，持久作战，把抗美救国战争进行到底，直到取得最后的胜利。七亿中国人民坚决支持英雄的越南人民打下去，打到底，把美国侵略强盗一个不剩地从越南的国土上赶出去！
