The Soviet revisionist leadership has recently repeatedly complained about their "theoretical level" being low and "seriously lagging behind the demands of the contemporary era." They shout loudly, demanding that their hired scholars "firmly refute" "hostile views" in the "sharp ideological struggle." It is as if a fly hitting a wall, "buzzing, a few cries of despair, a few sobs."

Hasn't the Soviet revisionist clique always boasted about their "superior" theory? Haven't they claimed how they have "creatively developed and enriched Marxism-Leninism"? Yet now they are frantically shouting about their "theoretical level" being low. This fact fully reflects the shameful failure of modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist clique, and it also fully reflects the great fear felt by this gang of traitors in the face of the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought.

In reality, modern revisionism represented by Khrushchev and his successors has no "theory" to speak of, let alone any "theoretical level." The revisionist goods they peddle are not their own creations but are wholesale imports. Things like "peaceful transition" and "parliamentary road" are completely plagiarized from the Second International revisionism. Things like "humanitarianism" and "welfareism," things like "profit law" and "material incentives," are all borrowed from bourgeois scholars. As for the various arguments attacking and slandering China, they are all picked from the imperialist anti-communist arsenal.

Revisionism is inherently a deceptive false doctrine. Modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist clique does not even reach the "level" of their predecessors. As servants of the bourgeoisie in the period of the total collapse of imperialism, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique cannot produce any "theory" and can only engage in spreading rumors, slandering, quibbling, falsifying history, taking things out of context, and deceiving people. In this regard, their "level" is not "declining" but is constantly "rising."

Marx once mocked the opportunist Proudhon, saying: "Proudhon himself feels his arguments so hollow, feels so completely incapable of discussing these things, that he suddenly loses control and becomes angry... howls, rages, curses, points to the sky, swears, pounds his chest and the table." This passage is not also a vivid portrayal of today's Soviet revisionist traitor clique?

The Soviet revisionist clique wants their hired scholars to work even harder to "refute" the so-called "hostile views," which is to attack the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is laughable and self-delusional. This gang of traitors attacking Mao Zedong Thought is like a group of ugly creatures spitting wildly at the sun, their spit only falls on their own faces, and does not harm the sun's brilliance in the slightest.

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is shining brilliantly all over the world, illuminating the path forward for the revolutionary people of the world. Today, the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The revolutionary people of the world are jubilant, let the Soviet revisionist traitors go and sob!

### 苏修叛徒的抽泣

    苏修叛徒的抽泣
    苏修领导集团近来一再公开抱怨他们的“理论水平下降”，“严重落后于当代的要求”，并且大叫大嚷要他们的御用学者在“尖锐的意识形态斗争”中，对“敌对的观点”进行“坚决回击”。真是有如碰壁的苍蝇，“嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。”
    苏修集团不是一向吹嘘他们“理论”“高超”得很吗？不是说他们如何“创造性地发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义”吗？可是现在却气急败坏地叫喊起“理论水平下降”了。这个事实，充分反映了以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义的可耻破产，也充分反映了苏修集团这一伙叛徒在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的威力面前所感到的极大恐惧。
    其实，以赫鲁晓夫及其继承者为代表的现代修正主义，根本就没有什么“理论”，更谈不上什么“理论水平”。他们所贩卖的修正主义货色，并非自家创造，而是从别人那里批发来的。什么“和平过渡”呀、“议会道路”呀，完全是抄袭第二国际修正主义的。什么“人道主义”呀、“福利主义”呀，什么“利润法则”呀、“物质刺激”呀，完全是从资产阶级学者那里搬来的。至于攻击和诬蔑中国的种种论调，更是从帝国主义的反共武库里拣来的破烂。
    修正主义本来就是骗人的假道理。而以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义，连他们的前辈的“水平”也达不到。苏修叛徒集团作为帝国主义走向全面崩溃时期的资产阶级的奴仆，他们更是不可能搞出什么“理论”，而只能以造谣、诽谤、诡辩、篡改历史、断章取义、弄虚作假为能事。在这方面，他们的“水平”不是“下降”，而是不断“上升”。
    马克思曾经嘲笑机会主义者普鲁东时说：普鲁东“本人如此感到自己论据空空洞洞，如此感到完全无力谈论这一切东西，以致突然忘形地恼怒起来……嚎叫，发疯发狂，肆口谩骂，指天画日，赌咒发誓，捶胸拍案”。这一段话，不也正是对今天苏修叛徒集团的一幅生动的写照吗？
    苏修集团要他们的御用学者更加卖劲儿地向所谓“敌对的观点”“回击”，也就是对伟大的毛泽东思想进攻，这真是可笑不自量。这一伙叛徒攻击毛泽东思想，就象一群丑类唾沫乱飞地向着太阳狂吠，他们的唾沫只能落在自己的脸上，而丝毫无损于太阳的光辉。
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想正在全世界放射出灿烂的光芒，照耀着世界革命人民前进的道路。今天世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，世界革命人民欢欣鼓舞，让苏修叛徒们去抽泣吧！
