	Workers are the Decisive Factor in Production
	Maintenance Worker Li Xihuan Zhao Shuzeng

	The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to achieve his sinister goals of usurping the Party and the state, attempted to steer our country's industry onto the capitalist track. He blatantly defied the great leader Chairman Mao's directive on political leadership, vigorously advocating "technical leadership." He absurdly claimed that during the construction of New China, "technical work should take the primary position," and "technical work should determine everything."

	The Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy was treated as gospel by a clique of capitalist-roaders within our factory. On the issue of the relationship between people and equipment, they did not trust the boundless wisdom and creativity of the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They worshipped technical equipment, especially foreign equipment, believing that only good equipment could ensure high quality and high production. Therefore, they did not hesitate to waste the country's foreign exchange to purchase foreign machinery worth millions of yuan. They praised foreign machinery to the skies, establishing numerous rules and regulations, forbidding workers from making improvements and innovations, and even threatening workers by saying, "If you break it, who will be responsible?" They used these methods to shackle the workers' initiative and creativity, greatly hindering the development of production.

	This fallacy of "technical leadership," which sees only equipment and not people, contradicts Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the decisive factor is people, not things." In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our factory's revolutionary workers have extensively studied Chairman Mao's works, criticized the fallacy of "technical leadership," and fostered a spirit of daring innovation. They have made innovations to these foreign machines and successfully developed new products with advanced levels. This proves that people are the most important and decisive factor in production. Once we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, we can make machines function at their maximum capacity.

	Chairman Mao teaches us, "The masses are the real heroes." He instructed us that in industrial production, we must also launch mass movements. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, advocated "technical leadership," opposing the mass line in industrial production and instead advocating the "expert line." This is exactly what the clique of capitalist-roaders within our factory did. They attempted to gradually transform socialist enterprises, where the working class is the master, into capitalist enterprises.

	In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," launched mass movements, and successfully experimented with innovations such as "nylon lace" and "regenerated shuttle heads," achieving victories in both revolution and production!

	The factory is indeed about production, but first and foremost, it is a matter of direction and path—whether you are pursuing capitalism or socialism. Is it political leadership over production, or production overriding politics? The so-called "production leadership" or "technical leadership" is actually bourgeois political leadership.

	The Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "technical leadership" completely inverted the relationship between politics and technology. He attempted to make our workers focus solely on technical and professional research, without concerning themselves with proletarian politics, not studying Chairman Mao's works, and not engaging in ideological transformation. He wanted to turn our workers into short-sighted political mediocrities, allowing him to restore capitalism. This is absolutely impossible. We must brandish the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize all the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminate their poisonous influence, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    工人群众是生产的决定因素
    保全工　李熙环　赵树增
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了达到他篡党、篡国的罪恶目的，妄图把我国工业纳入资本主义轨道。他公然违抗伟大领袖毛主席的政治挂帅的指示，大肆鼓吹“技术挂帅”。他胡说什么：建设新中国的时候，“技术工作就要占首要地位”，“技术工作就要决定一切”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的这个谬论，被我厂党内一小撮走资派奉若神明。在人和物的关系问题上，他们不相信用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，有无穷的智慧和创造力。他们迷信技术设备，特别是迷信洋设备，认为只有设备好才能优质高产。因此，他们不惜浪费国家的外汇，从外国购买价值上百万元的洋机器。他们把洋机器说得神乎其神，制定了许多清规戒律，不许工人进行改进和革新，还恐吓工人说：“改坏了，谁负责？”他们用这些办法，来束缚工人的积极性和创造性，大大影响了生产的发展。
    这种见物不见人的“技术第一”的谬论，违背了毛主席“决定的因素是人不是物”的伟大教导。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我厂革命职工大学大用毛主席著作，批判了“技术第一”的谬论，发扬了勇于创造的精神，对这些洋机器进行了革新，试制出具有先进水平的新产品。事实证明，人是生产中最重要的决定性的因素，我们一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就能够使机器发挥最大的效能。
    毛主席教导我们说：“群众是真正的英雄”。他老人家指示我们，在工业生产上也必须大搞群众运动。中国赫鲁晓夫却鼓吹“技术挂帅”，反对在工业生产上走群众路线，而要走“专家路线”。我厂党内一小撮走资派就是这样干的。他们妄图把工人阶级当家做主的社会主义企业，慢慢蜕变为资本主义企业。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，大搞群众运动，试验成功了“尼龙花边”、“再生梭头”等十几项技术革新，获得了革命、生产双胜利！
    工厂是要搞好生产的，但是首先是一个方向道路问题，就是你是搞资本主义还是搞社会主义？你是政治统帅生产，还是生产压倒政治？所谓“生产挂帅”或“技术挂帅”，实际上也就是资产阶级的政治挂帅。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“技术第一”的谬论，根本颠倒了政治和技术的关系。他妄想使我们工人只埋头钻研技术、业务，而不过问无产阶级政治，不去学习毛主席著作，不去搞思想革命化，使我们工人成为鼠目寸光的政治庸人，让他复辟资本主义。这是绝对办不到的。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的一切修正主义的黑货，肃清它的流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
