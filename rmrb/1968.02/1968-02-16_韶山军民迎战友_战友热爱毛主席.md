The comrades-in-arms from the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe expressed their immense honor and happiness at visiting the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

New China News Agency, Changsha, February 15th - The entire troupe of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, who came from the front lines of the struggle against American imperialism, visited and toured the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao, the reddest of the red, on the 13th and 14th of this month.

The comrades-in-arms from the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe felt immensely honored and happy to be able to visit the hometown of the great leader Chairman Mao, Shaoshan. Before departing, they wore the golden Mao badges given to them by Chinese comrades, singing songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, such as "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" and "Long Live Chairman Mao!" along the way.

The revolutionary people of Shaoshan, rich in revolutionary traditions, and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaoshan, held high the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Vietnamese people Ho Chi Minh, and the Chairman of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho. They beat drums, set off firecrackers, and warmly welcomed the South Vietnamese cultural warriors. When the troupe arrived, the people of Shaoshan waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted slogans of welcome. The troupe leader, Nguyen Xuan Hong, and all the members enthusiastically joined the welcoming crowd, shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

The South Vietnamese comrades-in-arms spent two days meticulously visiting Chairman Mao's former residence, the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence, and the places where Chairman Mao had worked, studied, and engaged in revolutionary activities. During the visit, the South Vietnamese comrades-in-arms expressed their love for the great leader Chairman Mao in various ways. Some pointed to the sturdy pine tree next to Chairman Mao's former residence and said to the Chinese comrades, "It symbolizes the indomitable revolutionary spirit of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!" Others, in front of Chairman Mao's statue, could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" After the visit, Nguyen Xuan Hong, the troupe leader, tightly held the hands of the Chinese comrades and said excitedly, "Through this visit, we have further understood Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities and the glorious path he led in the Chinese revolution. We love Chairman Mao even more."

The South Vietnamese cultural warriors also sang songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, such as "The East Is Red," "Long Live Chairman Mao," and "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," for the revolutionary masses, soldiers, and Red Guards of Shaoshan. They performed songs and dances reflecting the heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people against American imperialism.
