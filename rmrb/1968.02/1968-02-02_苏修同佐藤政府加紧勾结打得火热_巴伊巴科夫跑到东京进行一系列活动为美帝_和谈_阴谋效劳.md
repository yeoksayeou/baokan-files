According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on February 1, Tokyo: Just as U.S. imperialism is intensifying its use of Japanese reactionaries on the issue of invading Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership dispatched its Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Baibakov, to Tokyo to engage in a series of activities, closely colluding with the Sato government to serve the U.S. imperialist "peace talks" plot.

Baibakov arrived in Tokyo on January 16 and held a series of talks with Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku and Foreign Minister Miki Takeo on the issues of Vietnam and Sino-Soviet relations. He also humbly "paid his respects" to the Japanese Emperor and left Japan for Moscow on February 1.

During his talks with Sato and Miki on the Vietnam issue, Baibakov fully exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in its unremitting service to U.S. imperialism. Sato Eisaku, the running dog of U.S. imperialism, told Baibakov that "the Soviet Union has a great deal of say" in the Vietnam issue and that Japan demands that the Soviet Union make full efforts to "resolve the Vietnam issue as soon as possible." Baibakov shamelessly responded, "We will definitely strive for a peaceful resolution." Miki Takeo, in accordance with the U.S. imperialist's intentions, proposed a so-called "international mutual guarantee" plan for a "peaceful" resolution of the Vietnam issue, advocating that "to bring the United States and North Vietnam to the negotiating table," "Japan and the Soviet Union should mutually guarantee." Baibakov immediately agreed to convey Miki's "opinions" to the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin and others.

The U.S. imperialism, which has been beaten to a pulp and is at its wits' end by the heroic Vietnamese people, has recently intensified its use of Japanese reactionaries and the Soviet revisionist leadership to find a way out for its "peace talks" plot.

Baibakov, who also serves as the Chairman of the State Planning Committee of the Soviet Union, held "heart-to-heart" negotiations with the Japanese government's financial, commercial, and economic planning leaders as well as the heads of Japanese monopolistic enterprises on the issue of Sino-Soviet economic "cooperation." He asked the Japanese reactionary government and monopolistic capital to "develop" Siberia and hoped to obtain Japan's "assistance" in the new five-year plan starting in 1971. This indicates that the Soviet revisionist leadership, in the face of severe economic difficulties, is attempting to further sell out the interests of the Soviet people, "drinking poison to quench thirst," and is plotting to use Japanese capital and technology to further promote the complete restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union.

    苏修同佐藤政府加紧勾结打得火热
    巴伊巴科夫跑到东京进行一系列活动为美帝“和谈”阴谋效劳
    据新华社一日讯　东京消息：正当美帝国主义在侵略越南问题上加紧利用日本反动派的时候，苏修领导集团派出了它的部长会议副主席巴伊巴科夫到东京活动，同佐藤政府密切勾结，为美帝的“和谈”阴谋效劳。
    巴伊巴科夫一月十六日到达东京后，围绕越南问题和日苏关系问题同日本首相佐藤荣作和外相三木武夫等进行了一系列会谈，并且卑躬屈膝地“谒见”了日本天皇，于二月一日离日本回莫斯科。
    巴伊巴科夫在同佐藤、三木会谈越南问题时充分暴露了苏修领导集团不遗余力地为美帝效劳的叛徒嘴脸。美帝走狗佐藤荣作对巴伊巴科夫说，在越南问题上“苏联有很大的发言权”，日本要求苏联全面地努力“早日解决”越南问题。巴伊巴科夫对此恬不知耻地表示：“一定尽力争取和平解决”。三木武夫在会谈中按照美帝意旨抛出了一个所谓“和平”解决越南问题的“国际相互保证”方案，鼓吹什么“为了使美国和北越走到谈判桌上来”，“日苏两国应当相互保证”。巴伊巴科夫当即答应他将把三木的“意见”传达给苏修头目柯西金等。
    被英雄的越南人民打得头破血流、走投无路的美帝国主义，最近加紧利用日本反动派和苏修领导集团为它的“和谈”阴谋寻找出路。
    兼任苏联国家计划委员会主席的巴伊巴科夫，还同日本政府的财政、商业、经济计划方面的头目以及日本垄断企业的头目等就日苏经济“合作”问题进行了“推心置腹”的谈判。他要求日本反动政府和垄断资本去“开发”西伯利亚，并希望在从一九七一年开始的新的五年计划中得到日本的“帮助”。这表明，苏修领导集团在严重的经济困难面前，妄图进一步出卖苏联人民利益，“饮鸩止渴”，并且阴谋利用日本的资本和技术进一步促进苏联彻底复辟资本主义。
