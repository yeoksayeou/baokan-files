This year, the struggle among imperialist powers to shift economic crises and vie for world markets has intensified.

In 1967, the capitalist world witnessed a phenomenon unprecedented since the end of World War II: all the major capitalist countries in Western Europe and North America experienced stagnation or decline in industrial production, increased unemployment, and signs of impending economic crisis, with the situations in the United States, Britain, and West Germany being the most severe. According to statistics from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in Britain, the industrial production growth rate of more than ten developed capitalist countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy, was 7.4% in 1966 compared to 1965, but only 1.5% in 1967 compared to 1966. Among these, the United States grew by 9% in 1966 compared to 1965, but only 0.5% in 1967 compared to 1966. Britain grew by 1.1% in 1966 but declined by 1% in 1967. Particularly notable is West Germany, which had seen annual growth in industrial production since the war, but in 1967, not only did it fail to continue growing, it declined by 3.2%. This reflects the shrinking domestic and foreign markets of these countries. The economic situations of the United States, Britain, and West Germany, which together account for about 70% of the world's industrial production, have deteriorated sharply, along with the devaluation of the pound and the dollar crisis, causing great panic throughout the capitalist world.

To escape the economic crisis and restore industrial production growth, various imperialist countries have taken various measures and countermeasures this year to vie for markets. This has further sharpened the contradictions among the imperialist powers.

In his "Economic Report" to the U.S. Congress on February 1, U.S. imperialist leader Johnson acknowledged that there are "many uncertainties and difficulties" in the United States' domestic and economic affairs. He worriedly said that if this situation cannot be reversed, not only will the United States face "a possible fiscal crisis and perhaps ultimately economic recession," but the "international financial system" of the capitalist world will also "collapse," and "economic development will spiral downward." Johnson vociferously demanded that other imperialist countries help the United States, "lower trade barriers," "allow other countries broader access to their capital markets," and not implement the "competitive policy of making neighbors destitute" that the capitalist world tried in the 1930s. Johnson's cries reflect the U.S. imperialists' panic and desperation in the face of severe political and economic crises.

However, it is ironic that Johnson himself is implementing the very "policy of making neighbors destitute." On New Year's Day, to save the dollar's position and reduce the U.S. international trade deficit, he took "emergency measures" primarily aimed at striking France and other Western European countries. The U.S. sees the Western European "Common Market" as a formidable rival. In addition to restricting U.S. private travel to Western Europe and requiring overseas U.S. companies to remit more profits, the Johnson administration also implemented discriminatory measures against Western Europe in restricting U.S. private direct investment abroad, allowing investment in so-called "underdeveloped countries" and Canada, Japan, Australia, and Britain to reach 110% and 65% of the 1965-1966 investment levels, respectively, while completely halting investment in Western European countries. This will deprive France and other Western European "Common Market" countries of the dollar income needed for economic expansion and to offset trade deficits, thereby weakening France and the Western European "Common Market" countries' economic strength to counter the United States. Moreover, the United States plans to provide export subsidies to lower the export prices of U.S. goods, enhance their competitiveness in the world market, and simultaneously impose higher import taxes to erect tariff barriers against foreign goods. To drive Western European, especially French, goods out of the domestic market, the U.S. ruling class has also launched a propaganda campaign in the country to boycott French goods and resist the import of French products.

Western European countries, on the one hand, are taking measures to alleviate their own economic difficulties, and on the other hand, are countering U.S. "emergency measures" with similar policies of making neighbors suffer.

The British Wilson government, to cut spending, decided to withdraw British colonial troops from the Suez region ahead of schedule and canceled a $1 billion order for U.S. F-111 fighter jets. Regarding the U.S. plan to provide export subsidies and impose higher import taxes, Wilson publicly stated that if the United States does so, Britain will reconsider its original plan to cancel export subsidies. To stimulate exports, the British government decided to provide the necessary foreign exchange from national reserves to exporters. The British government also actively supports the merger of large British enterprises such as banks and automobiles to enhance the competitiveness of British products in the world market.

At the same time, with U.S. support, Britain is vigorously urging Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, members of the Western European "Common Market," to pressure France on the issue of Britain's entry into the "Common Market," aiming to break into the "Common Market." The three countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, after multiple discussions in January, decided to "coordinate" their policies and implement "comprehensive economic integration," on the one hand, to counter U.S. "emergency measures," and on the other hand, to align with Italy and West Germany with Britain, isolating France. Their decision was immediately welcomed by British Foreign Secretary Brown, but the contradictions within the Western European "Common Market" have intensified.

In addition to continuing to reject Britain's entry into the "Common Market," France is vigorously resisting and countering U.S. pressure. French officials publicly stated that U.S. companies in France are, legally speaking, French companies and cannot follow U.S. government orders to remit more profits to the United States. To maintain France's $60 billion gold reserves and obtain the capital needed for expanded investment to change the economic stagnation, the French government announced in late January the implementation of a deficit budget, attempting to stimulate consumption and investment by reducing some income taxes and increasing housing construction. France also began imposing a "value-added tax" on wholesale, retail trade, and service industries starting in January. This tax method will indirectly subsidize exports and impose higher taxes on imports, immediately drawing U.S. opposition. At the same time, France is actively utilizing the Middle East situation to expand economically and infiltrate the region, seizing the U.S. and British markets there.

West Germany also began implementing a "value-added tax" in January. It is estimated that the implementation of the value-added tax will increase the Bonn government's revenue from exploiting the German working class by $6 billion to $7 billion. The Bonn government, while supporting Britain's entry into the "Common Market" and using this as leverage in negotiations with the U.S. and Britain over the costs of their troops stationed in West Germany, is also trying to maintain relations with France and preserve its superior position in the "Common Market."

This struggle among imperialist powers for world markets is intensifying. This struggle will inevitably cause the imperialist bloc to further disintegrate and deepen the political and economic crises of the entire capitalist world. This has led the U.S. *International Herald Tribune* to lament: "If trade recession is followed by economic stagnation, and then a series of protective and restrictive chain reactions," 1968 will truly be a "dark year" for the capitalist world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "We are now in an era when the imperialist system is heading towards total collapse, and the imperialists have fallen into an insoluble crisis." Now, the crisis that imperialist countries have fallen into has reached an unprecedentedly severe level. All their struggles cannot save their doomed fate.

### 互相转嫁经济危机的明争暗斗

    互相转嫁经济危机的明争暗斗
    今年以来，帝国主义之间为了互相转嫁经济危机、争夺世界市场而进行的明争暗斗，正在日趋激烈。
    一九六七年，资本主义世界出现了战后以来还没有过的现象，即西欧和北美的所有主要资本主义国家都发生了工业生产停滞或下降、失业增加、通货膨胀等经济危机迫近的迹象，而以美国、英国和西德等三个最大的资本主义国家的情况为最严重。据英国全国经济及社会研究所的统计，包括美国、加拿大、日本、英国、法国、西德、意大利等十多个工业发达的资本主义国家的工业生产增长率，一九六六年比一九六五年增长百分之七点四，而一九六七年比一九六六年只增长了百分之一点五。其中美国一九六六年比一九六五年增长百分之九，而一九六七年比一九六六年只增长了百分之零点五。英国在一九六六年增长了百分之一点一，一九六七年则下降了百分之一。特别是战后工业生产年年增长的西德，在一九六七年不仅没有继续增长，反而下降了百分之三点二。这反映了这些国家国内外市场的日益萎缩。美、英、西德这三个国家的工业生产约占资本主义世界工业生产的百分之七十。它们经济情况的急剧恶化，加上随之而发生的英镑贬值和美元危机，在整个资本主义世界引起了极大的恐慌。
    各帝国主义国家为了逃避经济危机，恢复工业生产的增长，今年以来纷纷采取各种措施和反措施，来争夺市场。这就使帝国主义之间的矛盾更加尖锐化起来。
    美帝国主义头子约翰逊在二月一日向美国国会提出的“经济报告”中，承认美国“国内和经济事务中有很多捉摸不定的情况和困难”。他忧心忡忡地说，如果这种情况不能扭转，不但美国要“出现一场可能的财政危机，也许最后出现经济衰退”，而且资本主义世界的“国际财政制度将会垮台”，“经济发展盘旋下降”。约翰逊声嘶力竭地要求其他帝国主义国家帮美国的忙，“降低贸易壁垒”，“允许其他国家更广泛地进入它们的资本市场”，不要实行资本主义世界“在三十年代曾经尝试过竞争性的使邻居成为穷光蛋的政策”。约翰逊的这种叫嚷，反映了美帝国主义在严重的政治经济危机面前惊慌失措的窘态。
    但是，可笑的是，约翰逊自己所实行的就是“使邻居成为穷光蛋的政策”。他在元旦这天为了挽救美元地位、缩小美国国际收支逆差而采取的“紧急措施”，就是主要以打击法国等西欧国家为目的的。美国把西欧“共同市场”看作是美国的劲敌。约翰逊政府除了限制美国私人到西欧旅行、要求在海外的美国公司汇回更多利润以外，还在限制美国私人海外直接投资方面对西欧实行歧视性的办法，规定这种投资在所谓“不发达国家”和加拿大、日本、澳大利亚、英国，可以分别达到一九六五年到一九六六年度投资水平的百分之一百一十和百分之六十五，而对西欧国家却完全停止投资。这种做法将使法国等西欧国家得不到进行经济扩张和弥补国际收支逆差所需要的美元收入，从而削弱法国和西欧“共同市场”国家同美国抗衡的经济实力。不仅如此，美国还打算对出口实行补助，来降低美国商品的出口价格，加强它们在世界市场上的竞争能力，同时加征进口税，对外国商品树立关税壁垒。为了从国内市场上排挤西欧国家，特别是法国的商品，美国统治集团还在国内掀起了一个敌视法国、不买法国货的宣传运动，来抵制法国商品的进口。
    西欧国家一方面为了缓和本身的经济困境，一方面为了对付美国的“紧急措施”，也纷纷采取这种以邻为壑的办法。
    英国威尔逊政府为了削减开支，在决定提前从苏伊士以东地区撤退英国殖民军队的同时，取消了价值十亿美元的对美国F—111型战斗机的订货。对于美国打算实行出口补助、加征进口税的消息，威尔逊公开表示，如果美国这样做，英国就要改变原来打算取消出口补助的考虑。为了刺激出口，英国政府决定从国家储备中向出口商提供所需要的外汇。英国政府还积极支持英国的银行、汽车等大企业的合并，以加强英国产品在世界市场上的竞争地位。
    同时，英国在美国支持下，竭力策动西欧“共同市场”国家中的比利时、荷兰、卢森堡，在英国加入“共同市场”的问题上对法国施加压力，力图打入“共同市场”。比、荷、卢三国在一月份经过多次讨论，决定要“协调”三国政策，实行经济上的“全面联合”，一方面对付美国的“紧急措施”，一方面拉拢意大利和西德同英国挂钩，以孤立法国。它们的决定立即得到英国外交大臣布朗的欢呼，而西欧“共同市场”内部的矛盾却日益加剧了。
    法国除了继续拒绝英国加入“共同市场”以外，竭力对美国的压力进行抵抗和反击。法国官方公开表示，在法国的美国公司，从法律上说来是法国的公司，不能听从美国政府的命令把更多的利润汇回美国去。为了保持法国的六十多亿美元的黄金储备，同时获得扩大投资所需要的资本，改变经济停滞的现状，法国政府在一月底宣布实行赤字预算，企图用削减部分所得税，增加住房建筑等来刺激消费，进而刺激投资。法国还从一月份起对批发、零售贸易和服务行业实行征收“增值税”的办法，这种征税办法实际上将间接地补助出口，并对进口增税，因而立即遭到美国的反对。同时，法国积极利用中东局势，向中东地区进行经济扩张和渗透，夺取美英在这个地区的市场。
    西德也从一月份起实行“增值税”。据估计，实行增值税将使波恩政府从剥削西德劳动人民增加收入六十亿到七十亿美元。波恩政府一面支持英国加入“共同市场”，并且以此作为同美、英就它们在西德驻军的费用问题进行讨价还价的资本，一面又力图维持同法国的关系，维护自己在“共同市场”中的优越地位。
    帝国主义之间这种为争夺世界市场而进行的斗争，正在日益加剧。这个斗争势必促使帝国主义集团更加分崩离析，进一步加深整个资本主义世界政治经济危机。这使得美国《国际先驱论坛报》不禁哀叹道：“如果贸易衰退继之以经济停滞，接着又发生一系列保护和限制的连锁反应”，一九六八年对于资本主义世界来说，“将真正成为一个阴暗的年头”。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。现在，帝国主义国家所陷入的这种危机，已经发展到了空前严重的地步了。它们的一切挣扎，都无法挽救注定要灭亡的命运。
