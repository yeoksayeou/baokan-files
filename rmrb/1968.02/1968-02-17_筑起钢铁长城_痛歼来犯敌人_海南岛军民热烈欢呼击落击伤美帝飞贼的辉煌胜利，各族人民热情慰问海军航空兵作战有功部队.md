The people and military personnel of all ethnic groups on Hainan Island, along with local garrison troops, enthusiastically celebrated the heroic victory of our naval air force in shooting down and damaging one U.S. Navy A-1H attack aircraft each over Hainan Island. They strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' continuous military provocations against our country and their frenzied expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam. They declared that they would further fully implement the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, promote revolution, production, work, and preparedness, and make new contributions to achieving comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution and defending our national defense.

After our naval air force shot down and damaged the invading U.S. aggressor aircraft, revolutionary masses from nearby areas of the combat units flocked to the airfield and barracks to enthusiastically congratulate the soldiers on their victory.

The news of victory immediately stirred up the capital of Hainan Island, Haikou City. The radio station repeatedly broadcast the news of the aerial battle, and red big-character posters covered the streets.

The news reached a certain artillery position where Vice Chairman Lin had inspected nine years ago. The troops immediately held a victory celebration. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on never relaxing revolutionary vigilance and Vice Chairman Lin's personal inscription from nine years ago on the position, "Strengthen coastal defense, defend the motherland." They resolved to turn the position into a school of Mao Zedong Thought and build the front line of the South China Sea into an iron fortress, strengthen preparedness, and make new contributions to defending the Cultural Revolution and supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war.

Troops fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" enthusiastically hailed the new merits of the naval forces in the battle to defend the motherland.

The news of victory spread to coastal fishing ports, and the fishermen were excited, enthusiastically praising the heroic naval air force for fighting well.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, February 16 - In recent days, revolutionary masses from various places on Hainan Island, as well as commune members, farm workers, and various revolutionary mass organizations near the naval air force's base, have enthusiastically visited and congratulated the naval air force units that shot down and damaged one U.S. imperialist A-1H carrier-based attack aircraft each.

Revolutionary masses who came to visit included fishermen who sailed from the ends of the earth and members of various ethnic groups who crossed mountains and valleys from the Wuzhishan area. They enthusiastically congratulated the soldiers on their victory! They resolved to learn from the naval air force's unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, be ready at any time to fight side by side with the People's Liberation Army, and give a crushing blow to any enemy that dares to invade. At the same time, they unanimously expressed their determination to take the People's Liberation Army as an example, study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overcome factionalism, strengthen party spirit, accelerate the realization and development of revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination, launch a revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Guangdong Province, and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, pushing the Cultural Revolution to the end.

The heroic naval air force units expressed their gratitude for the enthusiastic visits from the people. They said: Defending Chairman Mao and the Cultural Revolution is our sacred duty. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Exert all efforts to annihilate the invading enemy." Our victory was achieved under the great situation of the Cultural Revolution nationwide. The glory belongs to our great leader Chairman Mao and to the people of the whole country.
