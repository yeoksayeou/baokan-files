The honorable revolutionary tradition of the Guangzhou proletariat has been swiftly and resolutely implemented, fully implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. They have overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and successfully held the first workers' congress of the Guangzhou proletariat from January 26 to 28. This has achieved the revolutionary great unity of the workers in the entire city.

The congress received congratulatory telegrams from the State Council and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. When the telegrams were read, the entire venue erupted in cheers that lasted for a long time. The representatives shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" repeatedly.

The proletariat of Guangzhou, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, united with the broad revolutionary masses, and bravely fought against the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. They made significant contributions to the great struggle for the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution in Guangdong Province.

Entering the brilliant year of 1968, the proletariat of Guangzhou has most resolutely responded to the great battle call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, further resolutely fought against selfishness, surrounded bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and vigorously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This has promoted the continuous development of revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the city. Now, more than 90% of the large and medium-sized factories in Guangzhou have achieved revolutionary great unity, and many units have established revolutionary committees.

The representatives attending the congress exchanged experiences in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism and implemented action measures for the five battle tasks of 1968.

Leaders of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, and the Guangdong Military Region, including Liu Xingyuan, Kong Shiquan, Wang Shudao, Jian Caifang, Yan Fusheng, Chen Fuhong, Yan Zhiquan, Long Daquan, and Chen De, attended the congress.

Kong Shiquan and Wang Shudao, members of the provincial revolutionary preparatory group, spoke at the meeting.

Chen Fuhong, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, expressed the warmest congratulations and the most resolute support to the congress.

Fighting hero Mai Xiande, representative of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Guangzhou troops, and representatives from the front lines of the anti-British and anti-violence struggle in Hong Kong and Kowloon, were invited to attend the congress.

The congress passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and also passed a letter to all revolutionary workers in the city.
