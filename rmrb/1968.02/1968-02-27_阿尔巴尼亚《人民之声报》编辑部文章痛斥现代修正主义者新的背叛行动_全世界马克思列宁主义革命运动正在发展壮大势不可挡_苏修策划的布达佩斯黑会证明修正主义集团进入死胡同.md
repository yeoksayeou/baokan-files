The editorial board of Albania's "People's Voice" published an article on February 21st, exposing the chaotic internal conflicts within the revisionist camp as they prepared for the so-called "International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties" in Budapest. The article, titled "The Budapest Counter-Revolutionary Meeting: A New Betrayal by the Revisionists of the Khrushchev School," points out that the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has long attempted to convene a large-scale revisionist meeting through deception and threats. Their goal is to garner support for their revisionist line and assert their leadership over the international communist movement. The Soviet revisionists place high hopes on this meeting, aiming to deceive the Soviet people, halt the disintegration of the revisionist camp, suppress the widespread centrifugal tendencies, and establish Moscow's hegemony over other revisionist elements.

They need the Budapest meeting as a platform to internationally condemn the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, attempting to isolate these parties and disrupt the burgeoning global Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movement.

However, what is the situation on the eve of the Budapest meeting?

Firstly, it must be noted that the situation from the outset is far from favorable. The Soviet revisionists demand a "total mobilization" of the revisionist front to strengthen the struggle against the Communist Party of China, the Party of Labour of Albania, and the new Marxist-Leninist revolutionary forces. This is the fundamental point and the primary purpose of the Budapest meeting. However, they have failed to impose this fundamental point on their accomplices. This primary goal has failed, and the participants are fragmented.

Other revisionists fear that if they comply with the Soviet revisionists' schemes and join the anti-China, anti-Albania movement, they will face greater resistance within their parties, further exposing and striking their opportunistic line. They believe it is more appropriate to engage in struggle with the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania at a time and in a manner of their own choosing. Of course, they do not willingly adopt such tactics; they are forced to do so due to bitter experiences, the repeated failures of their anti-Marxist plans and activities, and the bankruptcy of their betrayal line.

The preparatory activities have not, as the Soviet revisionists hoped, united the revisionist parties, strengthened their unified actions, but rather have exacerbated their divisions and made the centrifugal tendencies more apparent.

The article states that given this situation, we can say that the Budapest meeting has already failed before it even began. In the matter of participating or not participating in the Budapest meeting, the Soviet revisionists have employed all possible open and secret political means. Recent reports in various newspapers have proven that the Soviet revisionists have applied various economic pressures on certain recalcitrant parties to force them to attend the meeting. In some cases, the Soviet revisionists have even resorted to plotting conspiracies to overthrow the leadership of these parties and replace them with those who blindly obey Moscow's commands.

The article points out that even those parties that will attend the meeting are not tightly united, willing to submit to the Soviet revisionists, or serve Soviet political purposes. It can be said that almost every party that will attend the meeting has proposed its own platform and various demands and conditions. It is difficult for the organizers of the meeting to propose an agenda that satisfies everyone without harming the special interests of each participant. The Soviet revisionists are well aware of this, but now they cannot resolve the complex contradictions with their allies. The meeting machinery has already been set in motion and cannot be stopped. If the meeting is postponed to await a better time, it would mean an even more astonishing failure. Using delaying tactics will only make the Soviet leaders' reputation more tarnished, resulting in a merciless exposure before domestic and international public opinion. This would be equivalent to openly and formally admitting: their efforts to convene the promised meeting have failed, and no one listens to them anymore, not even their most subservient followers. They are no longer the center of world communism that they have been boasting about.

Therefore, they believe that holding an unsatisfactory meeting is better than not holding one at all. They still harbor a glimmer of hope that, as usual, they can exert pressure behind the scenes and engage in deception to force others to abandon their special interests, follow their line, and submit to their hegemonic plans. They believe that with great effort and a few more tricks, they can at least keep this stillborn child alive for a while, allowing them to boast and propagate this as an achievement of "unity" and "consensus," and so on.

The article points out that at this meeting, the revisionists will loudly proclaim anti-imperialism, and undoubtedly, they will not fail to curse imperialism. However, this clamor is a pure deception aimed at covering up the revisionists' conspiracies and deceiving innocent people. Behind this loud rhetoric is the Soviet-American alliance and the alliances between revisionist countries and various imperialist countries, agreements and collusions aimed at extinguishing revolution and suppressing the national liberation movements of various countries.

The article states that the revisionists attending the Budapest meeting are trying to make the public believe that the purpose of their meeting is to supposedly "defend and support" Vietnam's struggle against American aggressors. However, this claim is a clumsy bluff and a despicable trick to conceal their true support and assistance to the United States to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. Parties and countries directly in conflict with imperialists and fighting against imperialists will not send representatives to Budapest, thus proving that the revisionists' so-called anti-imperialism and support for Vietnam are a transparent deception.

The article states that the revisionists' various schemes have all proven to be futile. The Budapest meeting is doomed to fail, regardless of the agenda proposed, the topics discussed, whether the meeting is called a "consultative meeting" or a "discussion meeting," whether it is a large or small meeting, or whether it is a lower-level or highest-level meeting. In short, it is merely a performance of the revisionists' further degeneration, merely a manifestation of the revisionist camp's entry into a dead end, and merely a manifestation of their policy of surrender and betrayal. Undoubtedly, it will further promote the centrifugal and multi-center tendencies among the revisionists and once again deal a blow to the Soviet revisionist leadership's hegemony in the revisionist camp. The quarrels and divisions within the revisionist gang of wolves and dogs will inevitably intensify.

The article points out that as for the Marxist-Leninists, they are very optimistic about the situation. The current meeting organized by the Soviet revisionists is aimed at attacking Marxism-Leninism, but it has backfired, making the organizers suffer. The revisionists boast that their meeting is a measure that will help unite the communist movement, but they have proven to be the greatest splitters of the communist movement. They claim that this meeting will aid the anti-imperialist struggle, but the facts show that they are using every means to sabotage the anti-imperialist struggle. The people of the world have not been deceived. The people of the world see that the revisionists are desperately trying to extinguish the flames of revolution and liberation struggles, viciously attacking Marxism-Leninism, and spreading their poisonous thoughts of surrendering to the bourgeoisie and reactionaries.

The responsibility of Marxist-Leninists and other revolutionary forces is to use this situation to expose to the masses, who are still deceived by the revisionists, the extent to which the revisionist leaders have degraded these communist parties, and to the workers and peasants, that the Khrushchev-style leaders do not defend the interests of the workers and peasants but defend the interests of the new and old bourgeoisie. They have become tools of capitalist politics.

The article concludes that the situation created by the preparatory activities for the Budapest meeting has exposed the decay and degeneration of the revisionists. The people of various countries must observe and understand what kind of meeting this is, thereby better understanding the true counter-revolutionary and betrayal nature of the revisionists, better recognizing their danger, and thus remaining vigilant and more bravely and resolutely fighting against them.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》编辑部文章痛斥现代修正主义者新的背叛行动
    全世界马克思列宁主义革命运动正在发展壮大势不可挡
    苏修策划的布达佩斯黑会证明修正主义集团进入死胡同
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十一日发表编辑部文章，揭露苏修策划的为所谓“共产党和工人党国际会议”作准备的布达佩斯反革命黑会开场之前，修正主义集团内部矛盾重重，一片混乱。
    这篇题为《布达佩斯反革命会议——赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的一个新的背叛行动》的文章指出，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团早在几年以前就通过欺骗和威胁等手段，力图召开一个修正主义的大黑会，来为它的修正主义路线捧场叫好，并承认它是“国际共运”的最高领导。苏修集团对黑会寄予极大的希望，妄图借此竭力欺骗苏联人民；制止修正主义阵营的土崩瓦解，煞住规模广泛的离心运动，建立起莫斯科赫鲁晓夫分子对其他修正主义分子的霸权。他们需要布达佩斯会议这样一个场所，来对中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党进行“国际性的谴责”，妄图“孤立”中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，破坏势不可挡地壮大和发展的全世界的马克思列宁主义革命运动。
    但是，在布达佩斯会议前夕，情况究竟怎样呢？
    首先必须指出，情况一开头就十分不妙。苏修集团要求修正主义阵线“总动员”，以加强反对中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，反对新的马克思列宁主义革命力量的斗争。这是根本的一点，是布达佩斯会议的主要的目的。但是，它没有能够把这个根本的一点强加于它的同伙们。这个首要目的失败了，会议的参加者四分五裂。
    其他一些修正主义者担心，如果他们屈从苏修的图谋而参加反华、反阿尔巴尼亚运动，他们就会在党内遭到更大的反抗和反对，他们的机会主义路线就会进一步被揭露和遭到打击。他们认为，以自己所选择的时机和打算采取的办法单独同中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党进行斗争，比较适宜。当然，并非他们乐于重新采取这种伎俩，采取这种伎俩是被迫的，是由于有过惨痛的经验，是由于反马克思主义的计划和活动的多次失败，是由于他们的叛卖路线的破产。
    进行准备的活动非但没有象苏修所希望的那样，使修正主义党团结起来，加强它们的行动的统一，反而是加剧了它们的分裂，使离心倾向变得更加明显。
    文章说，鉴于这种情况，我们可以说，布达佩斯会议在它开始之前已告失败。在参加或不参加布达佩斯会议这个问题上，苏修采取了所能采取的公开的和秘密的一切政治手段。最近各国报刊刊登的许多消息证明，苏修对某些顽抗者施加了种种经济压力，要迫使他们参加会议，而且在某些情况下，苏修不惜策划阴谋，企图推翻这些党的领导，而用会盲目服从莫斯科命令的人代替他们。
    文章指出，即使那些将去参加会议的党，也并不就是什么紧密团结、愿意屈从于苏修，并为苏修政治目的效劳的。可以说，几乎将参加会议的每一个党都提出了各自的纲领和形形色色的要求与条件。会议的组织者要提出一个使人人都高兴、又不损害每一个参加者的特殊利益的议程方案来，是困难的。苏修也很了解这一点，但是现在它无法解决它同它的同盟者的错综复杂的矛盾。会议的机器已经开动了，再也不能把它停下来了。如果把这个会议推迟，等待较好的时机，那就意味着更加惊人的失败。采取拖延的伎俩，只会使苏修的头目们更加声名狼藉，将是在国内外舆论面前的一次毫不留情的暴露。这将等于是公开和正式地承认：他们为召开已经许下诺言的会议而作出的努力失败了，谁也不再听他们的了，连他们最卑顺的追随者也不听了，他们不再是他们拚命宣扬的世界共产主义的中心了。
    因此他们认为，开一次不象样的会总比不开好。他们仍然抱着一线希望，能象往常一样，在幕后施加压力和进行诡讹，来迫使别人放弃自己的特殊利益，追随他们的方针，屈从于他们行使霸权的计划。他们认为，作出巨大的努力，多打几针，至少可以使这个流产的婴儿活一些时候，他们就可以拚命吹嘘并大肆宣传这是“团结”、“一致”的成就，等等。
    文章指出，在这次会议上，修正主义者将侈谈反帝，毫无疑问，他们免不了把帝国主义咒骂一顿。但是这种喧嚣只是不折不扣的骗局，目的在于掩盖修正主义者的阴谋和欺骗天真的人们。在这种大肆叫嚷的背后，是苏美联盟以及修正主义国家与各个帝国主义国家的其它联盟，是帝国主义—修正主义的协议和勾结，为的是扑灭革命和镇压各国人民的民族解放运动。
    文章说，参加布达佩斯会议的修正主义者在竭力设法使公众舆论相信，他们的会议的目的是所谓“捍卫和支持”越南抗击美国侵略者的斗争。但是，这种说法是拙劣的虚张声势，是卑鄙的骗人伎俩，目的在于掩饰他们为了迫使越南人民屈服而向美国提供的真支持、真帮忙。同帝国主义者直接冲突和同帝国主义者作斗争的各个党和各国，都将不派代表到布达佩斯去，这就证明了修正主义者的所谓反帝和支持越南的姿态是虚伪透顶的骗局。
    文章说，修正主义者的种种算盘已经证明都落空了。布达佩斯会议是注定要失败的，不管提出什么议程，不管在那里讨论什么东西，不管这次会议叫“协商会晤”还是叫“讨论会”，不管是大会还是小会，也不管是较低级的还是最高级的会议。总之，它只不过是修正主义者更加堕落的一种表演，只不过是修正主义集团进入死胡同的一种表现，只不过是他们的投降和叛卖政策的一种表现。毫无疑问，它将更加促进修正主义者之间的离心倾向和多中心倾向的发展，并再次给予苏修领导集团在修正主义阵营中的霸权以打击。大家看到的修正主义狐群狗党内部的争吵和分裂必将加剧。
    文章指出，至于马克思列宁主义者，他们对形势是非常乐观的。苏修组织目前这次修正主义者的会议，是为了攻击马克思列宁主义，但是却走向了反面，使会议的组织者自讨苦吃。修正主义者吹嘘他们的会议是一个将会有助于共产主义运动团结的一个措施，但是他们已经证明，他们是共产主义运动的最大的分裂者。他们声称，这次会议会有助于反帝斗争，而事实表明，他们正在用一切办法破坏反帝斗争。全世界人民没有上当。全世界人民看到，修正主义者正在拚命扑灭革命和解放斗争的熊熊烈火，竭力攻击马克思列宁主义，散布他们向资产阶级和反动派屈膝投降的恶毒思想。
    马克思列宁主义者和其他革命力量的责任，就是利用这种局势向至今仍受修正主义者欺骗的群众指明，修正主义头目已经使这些共产党堕落到何种地步，向工农指明，赫鲁晓夫式的头目们是不捍卫工农的利益的，而是捍卫新老资产阶级的利益的，他们已经成了资本主义政治的工具。
    文章最后说，布达佩斯会议的准备活动所形成的局势，暴露了修正主义者的腐朽堕落。各国人民必须注视并理解这次会议是什么货色，从而更好地了解修正主义者的反革命和叛卖的真面目，更好地认识到他们的危险性，以便保持警惕，从而更勇敢、更坚决地同他们进行斗争。
