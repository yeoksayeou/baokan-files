The "Iron-Railway Soldier" Zhang Chunyu, who sacrificed himself to save his comrades and has been severely injured for over two years, has accomplished what new feats for the people in these two years, especially during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? What new progress has he made on the path of ideological transformation?

Zhang Chunyu, this soldier with a red heart and strong bones, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has overcome severe disabilities. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he has become even more red-hearted and strong-boned. He follows the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, loves the revolutionary youth and the revolutionary masses wholeheartedly; he harbors deep class hatred towards the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in various places, and has fought resolutely against them; he bravely fights against selfishness and criticizes revisionism, making significant strides on the path of ideological transformation. Recently, he was honored to attend the Second Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works of the Railway Corps.

Sailing the great seas relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Zhang Chunyu, a son of a poor peasant, grew into a glorious revolutionary soldier. On June 30, 1965, during a tunnel construction accident, he bravely rescued his injured comrades despite the imminent danger of a cave-in. Unfortunately, he was pinned under a massive boulder for over two hours, resulting in a severe compound fracture of his left femur and three broken ribs on his right side. In this life-threatening moment, he never forgot Chairman Mao and the cause of the Party, fully demonstrating the noble qualities of a proletarian soldier who fears neither hardship nor death.

In the hospital, this proletarian soldier's heart was filled with thoughts of Chairman Mao. Every morning, his first action was to hold the red revolutionary book and salute Chairman Mao. His first words were to wish Chairman Mao eternal life. The first song he sang was "The East Is Red," and the first thing he did was to study Chairman Mao's quotations. He often said, "I will strive to make every drop of blood, every nerve, and every cell overflow with limitless love for Chairman Mao."

Zhang Chunyu underwent his sixth surgery on his injured leg, requiring him to lie flat on his back for over two months without being able to turn over freely. To gain the strength to overcome his pain at all times, he specially asked his comrades who came to visit him to paste Chairman Mao's portraits all over the walls of his hospital room. On the day of the surgery, the nurse gave him an anesthetic, and he became drowsy, his eyes gradually closing. However, he still repeatedly recited, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," until he completely lost consciousness.

Eight hours passed, and Zhang Chunyu was pushed back into the hospital room. He was not yet fully conscious. The nurse asked if he was thirsty, but he did not respond. She asked if he was in pain, but he still did not respond. Someone mentioned Chairman Mao, and he immediately struggled to open his eyes, pointing at the wall and painfully but joyfully shouting, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" The nurse quickly held up a quotation board with Chairman Mao's portrait and said warmly, "Zhang Chunyu, look, Chairman Mao is watching you!" Zhang Chunyu heard this, immediately opened his eyes wide, gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait, and a smile of happiness spread across his face. He felt the eternal red sun rising in his heart, his body warmed, and he was filled with boundless strength, able to overcome any pain!

Zhang Chunyu lay on his back in the hospital bed. To prevent bedsores, the nurse helped him turn over every day. One day, the nurse just lifted him slightly, and suddenly a sharp pain shot through his incision. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. The nurse quickly comforted him and decided to rest for a while before turning him. Zhang Chunyu gripped the bed frame tightly with both hands, gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait and saying, "Chairman Mao is watching me, turn me, it's okay!" That night, the pain in his incision became severe again. The nurse wanted to read him some letters of encouragement, but he shook his head, looking at Chairman Mao's portrait and saying, "Letters, I'll read them later. Please read me Chairman Mao's quotations first!" The nurse read to him, "This army has an unyielding spirit, it will trample all enemies and never be subdued by them." "Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, boost our courage." The nurse read a sentence, and he repeated it. Chairman Mao's words had the greatest power. Zhang Chunyu listened and repeated, his spirit soaring, completely forgetting his pain.

Zhang Chunyu's left leg was severely fractured. After recovery, he needed to undergo arduous exercises to restore its function. During this period, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and, with indomitable willpower, overcame countless difficulties.

When he could first get out of bed, his left leg was like a wooden stick, stiff and straight, and he could only drag his right leg to walk. However, the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall and his quotations encouraged him to overcome various difficulties and persist in exercising step by step. Sometimes he was in so much pain that his vision blurred, his head spun, and his feet sweated so much that his shoes and socks were soaked. He repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's quotation, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and overcame pain and fatigue time and time again. After several months of hard training, he was finally able to walk without crutches.

Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Zhang Chunyu fought resolutely against his disabilities. In the hospital, he voluntarily read Chairman Mao's books, never slacking off or interrupting, no matter how severe the pain was. He wrote in his diary, "The demon is not to be feared, but the lack of Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind is to be feared."

In the past two years, Zhang Chunyu, with deep class feelings, diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, writing over 200,000 words of study notes and diaries. Every word was filled with his limitless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Seeing the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as a sacred duty

The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The revolutionary mass movement to establish Mao Zedong Thought is surging like a mighty torrent. Even in the hospital, Zhang Chunyu threw himself into this great mass movement, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as he could get out of bed, he actively signed up to join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in the hospital, using his crutches to go with everyone to various wards to propagate. He couldn't sing or play, so he read Chairman Mao's quotations for everyone. He actively supported the "Three Send Quotations" activity in the hospital: when convalescent patients were admitted, operated on, or discharged, he would give them a few of Chairman Mao's quotations according to their specific situations, and study and encourage each other together. Revolutionary masses and Red Guards asked him to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and he immediately picked up his crutches and went. Last August, he went from Shenyang to Harbin and was invited to a university to share his experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Suddenly, he had a headache and fever, and beads of sweat dripped from his forehead. Should he continue to speak? He looked up at Chairman Mao's portrait, felt full of energy, and continued to speak. That night, he was sent to the hospital, and the doctor advised him to stay for 10 to 15 days. However, he couldn't lie still in the hospital bed, stayed for five days, and as soon as his condition improved slightly, he insisted on being discharged. After being discharged, he continued to go to schools, offices, and military units with full enthusiasm to propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

Over the past year, whether in the hospital or on the road, regardless of the number of people, as long as there was an opportunity, he actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought. Once, he was invited to attend a celebration of the establishment of a revolutionary committee in a certain place. During the transfer, he temporarily found a place to rest. The revolutionary masses of the Railway Bureau wanted to invite him to report on his experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The responsible comrades considered that he had been on the train for a day and a night and was very tired, and did not immediately agree. Zhang Chunyu heard this and happily agreed to the revolutionary masses' request, using his crutches to go and speak for an afternoon. That night, until two minutes before the train departed, he was still enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the Red Guards and revolutionary masses. Another time, nine foreign friends wanted to invite Zhang Chunyu to talk about his experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. Zhang Chunyu heard this news and thought that propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the people of the world and using the great Mao Zedong Thought to inspire the revolutionary spirit of the people of the world was a sacred duty of every Communist Party member and revolutionary soldier. He immediately went to these foreign friends and spoke for nearly three hours. Later, he separately propagated to six friends from another country and three friends from another country. These foreign friends were deeply moved and said, "Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people but also the red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the revolutionary path of oppressed people all over the world. We will definitely learn from the People's Liberation Army of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and follow Chairman Mao's great teachings to resolutely fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries to the end and strive for complete liberation."

"Defending Chairman Mao, I am full of strength"

Chairman Mao issued a great call to the people of the country: "You must care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Zhang Chunyu responded most enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call and threw himself into this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led and initiated by Chairman Mao, and fought resolutely to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the great Red Guard movement swept across the country. Red Guard revolutionary youths smashed the Four Olds and established the Four News, with the momentum of a thunderbolt, cleansing the filth left over from the old society. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and ghosts and monsters everywhere spread rumors and slander. What attitude should be taken towards this new thing? Zhang Chunyu repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Chairman Mao said, "Revolution is an uprising, a violent action by one class to overthrow another class." Chairman Mao's teachings made Zhang Chunyu realize that the direction of struggle of the Red Guard youths was completely correct, and he immediately wrote an article in full support of the daring to think, speak, do, and dare to venture spirit of the Red Guard youths. When the joyous news of our great leader Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, receiving the Red Guard youths at Tiananmen Square reached the hospital, he immediately held up a portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform from his youth and sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with his fellow patients in the ward. Later, every time Chairman Mao received the Red Guard youths, Zhang Chunyu listened to the live broadcast with boundless joy and shared the happiness with the Red Guard youths who were accepting the inspection. One day, a group of Red Guard long march youths came to visit him. He specially asked someone to buy "The Three Constantly Read Articles" on the street and gave them to the youths, encouraging them to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, caring about national affairs. Hearing that a Red Guard was sick and in the hospital, he immediately sent the canned fruits given to him by his comrades to this Red Guard, comforting him to rest well and strive to set out on the journey soon. The Red Guard youths said, "We will be like Zhang Chunyu, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, carrying forward the hard-boned spirit, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

Zhang Chunyu deeply loved the Red Guard revolutionary youths and harbored deep hatred towards the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

Zhang Chunyu lay in the hospital bed, listening to and seeing from the radio and newspapers that the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and the revolutionary masses had smashed the "Three Family Village" and fiercely attacked the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. His heart felt a joy he had never experienced before. He angrily said, "These bad guys actually dare to oppose our red sun in our hearts! How evil their intentions are! I am a soldier of Chairman Mao. I will fight and, together with the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, fiercely attack the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and resolutely defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" He turned the hospital ward into a battlefield and wrote one critical article after another. One day, he saw in the newspaper a batch of materials exposing the crimes of the capitalist roaders within the Party. The more he read, the angrier he became, and he immediately picked up his pen to write a critical article.

At that time, his leg had just undergone surgery, and his body was still feverish. A slight movement would cause his leg to ache as if being pierced by needles. Writing a few lines would make him sweat profusely. The medical staff kindly advised him to rest, but he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," and he felt an endless source of strength. He silently recited, "All reactionary things, if you don't hit them, they won't fall." He wrote word by word. With the help of his comrades, he wrote over 3,000 words in one breath. In the past year, Zhang Chunyu has written over 30 critical articles, each filled with limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao and deep hatred towards the class enemies.

Just as the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses were holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, denouncing with both mouth and pen the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, Zhang Chunyu was writing critical articles while organizing denunciation meetings in the hospital ward, angrily denouncing China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. At the denunciation meeting, he used his own bitter family history and personal experiences to thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of advocating the "philosophy of survival," "suffering small losses for big gains," and "exploitation is meritorious." To criticize deeply and thoroughly "The Cultivation of the Self," he used his crutches to go to various wards to propagate and mobilize, organize articles, and together with the convalescent patients and staff, set up a special column for criticism. He also endured the pain and walked out of the hospital to criticize China's Khrushchev with the proletarian revolutionaries. Once, he participated in a criticism meeting of over 70,000 people. At that time, it was the hottest summer, and his injured leg had not yet healed. His comrades were concerned that he might not be able to endure it. However, he firmly said, "This is a battle, a battle to defend Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. I must go to the front line and fire at China's Khrushchev to defend Chairman Mao. I am full of strength!" At the meeting, he pushed away the chair prepared for him by his comrades, stood upright under the scorching sun, and with boundless anger, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

In the turbulent waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Zhang Chunyu, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, had his heart become even redder and his will even firmer. "Defending Chairman Mao, I am full of strength!" This is Zhang Chunyu's ironclad oath and his boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao in action.

Striving to be a hard-boned soldier in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism

In the hospital, Zhang Chunyu is a severely injured soldier. His leg was severely injured, but his heart was always filled with a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he repeatedly studied and applied "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, voluntarily carrying out a revolution in the depths of his soul and seriously transforming his worldview.

Zhang Chunyu remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of being humble, cautious, guarding against arrogance and impatience, and wholeheartedly serving the people. On the battlefield of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, he first seized the "self" manifested in the issue of honor and fiercely fought against it. After Zhang Chunyu was injured, the Party and the people gave him very high honors, and the Ministry of National Defense awarded him the glorious title of "Iron-Railway Soldier." Zhang Chunyu felt from the bottom of his heart that this honor should be entirely attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao and entirely to the Party and the masses. He wrote in his diary, "Honor, for a revolutionary soldier who truly masters Mao Zedong Thought, will forever be a new starting line. Honor can only indicate one's past, not one's present, and even less one's future."

In May 1966, the Ministry of National Defense awarded him the glorious title of "Iron-Railway Soldier." After the naming ceremony, he opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied Chairman Mao's teachings, "The masses are the real heroes," "Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind," and wrote these teachings in his diary and on quotation boards, reading and studying them every day, and constantly checking against them. Every time he received a letter of praise, a gift of encouragement, every time someone visited him, and every time he heard a word of praise for him, he would sit down and study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again, think about what he should have done but did not, see if he had any arrogant thoughts, and find the gap between his requirements and those of the Party and the people. Once, a commander from a brother unit came to the hospital to visit the wounded soldiers and heard that Zhang Chunyu was also hospitalized here, so he wanted to visit him. He heard this news and thought, "This commander is not from our unit and has never met me. It's inconvenient for me to get out of bed, so I'll just wait for him in bed!" This thought just flashed through his mind, and he immediately felt that this was not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings, so he quickly got up, using his crutches to go and welcome the commander. That night, he wrote in his diary, "Why did I have the thought of waiting? This is nothing but the arrogant thought of considering oneself a hero. I must seize and fight against this wrong tendency."

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Zhang Chunyu underwent new tempering and testing in this great revolutionary movement. He voluntarily raised the struggle against selfishness and the establishment of the public to the height of the struggle between the two lines, carried out a revolution in the depths of his soul, and continuously launched attacks on the "self," demonstrating the fighting style of a hard-boned soldier.

Last August, Zhang Chunyu participated in a conference on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Harbin City. After the conference, he was about to return to the hospital when someone suggested that the hospital's living quarters were in the midst of intense class struggle and that he might as well stay in Harbin. Zhang Chunyu immediately agreed. However, back in the dormitory, he couldn't calm down sitting in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. He thought, Chairman Mao teaches us that Communist Party members must face the wind and rain and see the world. How can I avoid the wind and rain of class struggle? He fiercely fought against the "self" that had just emerged, wrote down his determination, "To defend Chairman Mao, I can be crushed to pieces; to defend Mao Zedong Thought, I can climb the knife mountain and walk through the fire sea; to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I dare to eliminate all harmful creatures." Zhang Chunyu braved the storm and returned to the hospital, fighting alongside the proletarian revolutionaries and the revolutionary masses against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. In early January this year, the department where Zhang Chunyu was hospitalized achieved revolutionary great unity. This action was praised by some, but others did not support it. On the day of the celebration meeting, the proletarian revolutionaries of this department invited Zhang Chunyu to participate. He hesitated, fearing that supporting the wrong side would have a bad influence. With this question in mind, he studied Chairman Mao's teachings in "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, overcame the "self," discarded the "fear," and resolutely participated in the celebration meeting of the proletarian revolutionaries, expressing his firm support for their revolutionary actions. Under the leadership of this department, the entire hospital quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

The practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution educated Zhang Chunyu. He deeply felt that in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, there is no room for even a hint of selfishness. Only by overcoming the "self" can one be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments step by step.

Zhang Chunyu's more than two years of hospital life were shining. However, comparing himself to Chairman Mao's teachings, he felt that he was still far, far behind. He was determined to "start from the beginning" and "start from zero," with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," to diligently and seriously study and apply "The Three Constantly Read Articles," to be the most self-aware, the most resolute, the highest standard, and the strictest requirement, striving to be a hard-boned soldier in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, forever following Chairman Mao, with red loyalty and unshakable will.

Under the illumination of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, Zhang Chunyu is striding forward on the path of ideological transformation.

    忠于毛主席  心红骨头硬
    ——“铁道兵硬骨头战士”张春玉活学活用毛泽东思想的新事迹
    “铁道兵硬骨头战士”张春玉，为了抢救战友，身负重伤已经两年多了。两年多来，特别是在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他为人民又立了什么新功？在思想革命化的道路上又有什么新的进步？
    张春玉，这个用毛泽东思想武装起来的硬骨头战士，凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，战胜了严重伤残，在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得心更红、骨更硬。他遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，无限热爱革命小将和革命群众；他怀着刻骨的阶级仇恨，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人进行了坚决斗争；他勇敢地斗私批修，在思想革命化的道路上大大跨进了一步。最近，他光荣地出席了铁道兵第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。
    无限热爱毛主席大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    张春玉在毛泽东思想哺育下，由一个贫农的儿子成长为光荣的革命战士。一九六五年六月三十日，在隧道施工遇到意外塌方的危急时刻，他舍生忘死，奋勇抢救负伤战友，不幸被塌下的万斤巨石卡住达两个多小时，造成左股骨闭合性粉碎性骨折、右胸三根肋骨被压断的严重伤残。在生命垂危关头，他念念不忘毛主席，念念不忘党的事业，充分表现出一不怕苦、二不怕死的无产阶级硬骨头战士的高贵品质。
    到了病房，这位无产阶级硬骨头战士胸中只有毛主席。每天清早起来，他的第一个行动是手捧红色革命宝书向毛主席敬礼，第一句话是祝福毛主席万寿无疆，唱的第一个歌是《东方红》，做的第一件事是学习毛主席语录。他常说：“我要努力让每滴血液，每根神经，每个细胞都充满对毛主席的无限热爱。”
    张春玉的伤腿作第六次手术，需要在病床上仰卧两个多月不能自由翻身。他为了时刻获得战胜伤痛的力量，特地请前来看望他的战友在病房四周墙壁上贴满了毛主席像。动手术那天，护士给他注射了麻醉剂，他昏昏沉沉，眼睛逐渐睁不开了，但是，他还一遍又一遍地背诵着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，直到完全昏迷。
    八个小时过去了，张春玉被推回病房。他神智还没有清醒，护士问他渴不渴，他没有回答。问他痛不痛，也没有回答。不知谁说了声毛主席，他立刻艰难地睁开眼睛，用手指着墙上，吃力而又充满喜悦地喊：“毛主席！毛主席！”护士连忙把特地为他做的一块印有毛主席像的语录牌高高举起来，亲切地向他说：“张春玉，你看，毛主席在看你了！”张春玉一听，连忙睁大眼睛，凝望着毛主席像，脸上泛起幸福的微笑。他心中升起永远不落的红太阳，浑身温暖，充满无穷的力量，多么严重的伤痛都能战胜！
    张春玉仰卧在病床上，为了防止褥疮，护士每天帮助他翻身。一天，护士刚把他稍稍扶起，顿时刀口一阵钻心的疼痛，他额上冒出豆大的汗珠。护士连忙安慰他，并且决定休息一会再翻。张春玉双手使劲攥住床架，凝望着毛主席像说：“毛主席在看着我，翻吧，不要紧！”晚上，刀口又剧烈地疼痛起来，护士要给他读几封慰问信，他摇摇头，望着毛主席像说：“信，以后再看，请先给我念毛主席语录吧！”护士给他念：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”护士念一句，他跟着念一句。毛主席的话，威力最大，张春玉听着念着，精神焕发，完全忘却了伤痛。
    张春玉的左腿严重骨折。伤愈之后，需要进行艰苦的锻炼，才能恢复功能。在锻炼期间，他牢记着毛主席的教导，以顽强的毅力战胜了重重困难。
    他刚能下床的时候，左腿象条木棍，直楞楞的，只能让右腿拖着走。但是，墙上的毛主席像和毛主席语录，鼓舞着他克服各种困难，坚持一步一步地锻炼。有时候他痛得眼发黑，头发昏，双脚冒出的汗把鞋袜都渗湿了。他一遍又一遍地背诵“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录，一次又一次地战胜了疼痛和劳累。经过几个月的刻苦锻炼，他终于能去掉双拐走路了。
    张春玉靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，同伤残进行了坚决斗争。在病床上，他高度自觉地读毛主席的书，无论伤痛多么严重，从未放松或间断过。他在日记中写道：“病魔并不可怕，可怕的是头脑里没有毛泽东思想。”
    两年来，张春玉怀着深厚的阶级感情刻苦地学习毛主席著作，写下了二十万多字的学习心得和日记，字里行间充满着他对毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。
    把宣传毛泽东思想当作自己的神圣职责
    世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。大立毛泽东思想的革命群众运动，如滚滚洪流，汹涌澎湃。身在病房的张春玉，也投身到这个伟大群众运动中去，热情宣传毛泽东思想。他刚能下床，就积极报名参加了病房里组织的毛泽东思想宣传队，拄着双拐和大家一起到各个病房巡回宣传。他不会拉，不会唱，就为大家读毛主席语录。积极支持了病房里开展的“三送语录”活动：休养员入院、动手术、出院时，他总要针对这些同志的具体情况，送几条毛主席语录，和他们共同学习，互相勉励。革命群众、红卫兵小将请他宣传毛泽东思想，他毫不迟疑地拄起拐杖就去。去年八月间，他从沈阳到哈尔滨，应邀去一所大学讲活学活用毛主席著作的体会，突然头痛发烧，额上汗珠直往下淌。还讲不讲呢？他抬头看了看毛主席像，浑身是劲，继续讲了下去。当天晚上他被送进医院，医生要他住院十至十五天。可是，他在病床上怎么也躺不住，住了五天，病情稍好，就坚决要求出院了。出院后，他又以饱满的情绪，坚持到学校、机关、部队去宣传毛泽东思想。
    一年多来，不论在病房里，在外出的旅途中，不管是人多或人少，只要有机会，他都积极宣传毛泽东思想。一次应邀去某地参加庆祝革命委员会成立大会，途中转车临时找了个地方休息。铁路局的无产阶级革命派想请他报告活学活用毛主席著作的体会，负责同志考虑他坐了一天一夜的火车，身体很疲劳，没有立即同意。张春玉知道后，愉快地答应了革命群众的要求，拄着拐杖去讲了一个下午。这天晚上直到开车前两分钟，他还兴致勃勃地向红卫兵小将和无产阶级革命派战友宣传毛主席的最新指示。还有一次，有九位外国朋友想请张春玉去谈谈学习毛主席著作的体会。张春玉得知这个消息后，想到向世界人民宣传毛泽东思想，用伟大的毛泽东思想去鼓舞世界革命人民的斗志，这是每一个共产党员、每一个革命战士的神圣职责，立即前去向这些外国朋友讲了近三个小时。后来又分别给另外两个国家的六位朋友和三位朋友作了宣传。这些外国朋友听后十分感动地说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是全世界革命人民心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了全世界被压迫人民的革命道路。我们一定向用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军学习，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，坚决同帝、修、反斗争到底，争取彻底的解放。”
    “保卫毛主席，我浑身是力量”
    毛主席向全国人民发出伟大号召：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”张春玉最热烈地响应了毛主席的伟大号召，投入了这场由毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动，坚决为保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而斗争。
    文化大革命初期，伟大的红卫兵运动在全国各地兴起，红卫兵革命小将大破四旧，大立四新，以雷霆万钧之势，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和牛鬼蛇神，到处造谣诽谤，散布流言蜚语。对这个新生事物应当抱什么态度？张春玉反复学习了毛主席的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》，毛主席说：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”毛主席的教导使张春玉认清了红卫兵小将的斗争大方向是完全正确的，他立即写文章满腔热情地支持红卫兵小将敢想敢说敢干敢闯的无产阶级革命精神。当我们伟大领袖毛主席身穿军装在天安门接见红卫兵小将的喜讯传到医院，他立刻把毛主席当年身穿红军军装的像片高高举起，和病室的同志们一起高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。以后，每当毛主席接见红卫兵小将，张春玉都怀着无限喜悦的心情收听实况广播，和接受检阅的红卫兵战士们一起共享幸福。一天，一支红卫兵长征队的小将来看他，他特地请人到街上买回“老三篇”送给他们，鼓励小将们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，关心国家大事。听说一位红卫兵生病住院，他立刻把战友送给他的水果罐头转送给这位红卫兵，安慰他好好休养，争取早日踏上征途。红卫兵小将们感动地说：“我们一定象张春玉一样永远忠于毛主席，发扬硬骨头精神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    张春玉无比热爱红卫兵革命小将，刻骨仇恨党内一小撮走资派。
    张春玉躺在病床上，从广播里，报纸上，听到和看到广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，捣毁了“三家村”，猛烈地向党内一小撮走资派开火，心里感到从来没有过的痛快，他愤怒地说：“这些坏家伙，竟敢反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳，用心何等恶毒！我是毛主席的战士，我要战斗，要和广大无产阶级革命派一起，向党内一小撮走资派猛烈开火，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！”他把病房当战场，挥笔写出一篇又一篇批判文章。有一天，他看到报上登了一批揭露党内走资派罪行的材料，越看心里越火，立刻拿起笔来写批判稿件。
    当时，他的腿刚动过手术，身上还在发烧，稍一动，腿就痛得象针扎，写几行字，就出了一身汗。医护人员关切地劝他休息，他想起毛主席的教导：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”，身上增加了无穷的力量，他默默地念着：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”一字一句地写下去。在同志们的帮助下，他一口气写了三千多字。一年多来，张春玉写过三十多篇批判文章，每一篇都充满着对毛主席的无限忠诚，充满着对阶级敌人的无比仇恨。
    正当亿万革命群众高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，口诛笔伐以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派的时候，张春玉一边写批判文章，一边组织病室的休养员开声讨会，愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。在声讨会上，他用自己辛酸的家史和亲身体会，和大家一起彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“活命哲学”和“吃小亏占大便宜”、“剥削有功”等反动谬论。为了批深批臭黑《修养》，他拄着拐杖到各个病室去宣传动员，组织稿件，和休养员以及工作人员一起办了大批判专栏。他还忍受着伤痛，走出病房，和无产阶级革命派一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫。有一次，他参加一个七万多人的批判大会。当时正是盛夏，天气很热，他的伤腿尚未痊愈，同志们担心他支持不住。他却坚定地说：“这是一场战斗，是一场保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想的战斗，我一定要上阵，向中国赫鲁晓夫开炮，保卫毛主席，我浑身是力量！”在大会上，他把同志们给他准备好的坐椅推开，挺立在烈日下，怀着满腔怒火，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的惊涛骇浪中，张春玉在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，心炼得更红了，意志炼得更坚了。“保卫毛主席，我浑身是力量！”这是张春玉的钢铁誓言，也是他无限忠于毛主席的战斗行动。
    努力做斗私批修的硬骨头战士
    在医院里，张春玉是重伤员。他的腿受到严重的损伤，但是他的胸怀里却始终装着一颗忠于毛主席的红心。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他反复地活学活用“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示，自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，认真地改造世界观。
    张春玉牢记毛主席的谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为人民服务的伟大教导，在斗私批修的战场上，他首先抓住在对待荣誉问题上表现出来的“私”字，狠批猛斗。张春玉负伤后，党和人民给了他很高的荣誉，国防部授予他“铁道兵硬骨头战士”的光荣称号。张春玉打心眼里感到，这个荣誉应该完全归于伟大领袖毛主席，完全归于党和群众。他在日记中写道：“荣誉对于真正掌握了毛泽东思想的革命战士来说，将永远是一条新的起跑线。荣誉，只能说明自己的过去，而不能说明自己的现在，更不能说明自己的将来。”
    一九六六年五月，国防部授予他“铁道兵硬骨头战士”的光荣称号。命名大会结束后，他打开《毛主席语录》，学习毛主席的“群众是真正的英雄”，“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”等教导，并把这些教导记在日记本上，写在语录牌上，天天看，天天学，时时对照着检查。每当收到一封赞扬信，一件慰问品，每当别人来访一次，听到一句赞扬他的话，他都要坐下来重新学习一遍《为人民服务》，想一想过去有那些应该做的事而没有做，看一看自己是否有骄傲情绪，找一找同党和人民对自己的要求的差距。有一次，一位兄弟部队的首长来医院探望伤病员，听说张春玉也在这里住院，就要来看他。他听到这消息后，心里想：“这位首长不是我们单位的，又没见过面，我起床不方便，就在床上等着他吧！”这个念头刚闪过，他立刻就觉得这不符合毛主席的教导，连忙起来拄着双拐前去迎接那位首长。这天晚上，他在日记里写道：“我为什么会产生等着的思想？这不是别的，这是以功臣自居的骄傲思想，对于这种错误苗头要抓住狠斗。”
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是活学活用毛泽东思想斗私批修的大课堂。张春玉在这场伟大的革命运动中经受着新的锻炼和考验。他自觉地把破私立公提高到两条路线斗争的高度，在灵魂深处闹革命，不断对“私”字发动进攻战，表现了他硬骨头战士的战斗风格。
    去年八月，张春玉在哈尔滨市参加了一个活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会。会后正准备回医院，有人向他建议，医院住地阶级斗争很激烈，要他不如留在哈尔滨。张春玉当即表示同意。可是，回到宿舍，他坐在毛主席像跟前心里怎么也平静不下来。他想，毛主席教导我们，共产党员要经风雨，见世面，我怎能躲避阶级斗争的风雨呢？他狠斗了刚刚露头的“私”字，挥笔写下了自己的决心：“为了保卫毛主席，我可以粉身碎骨；为了保卫毛泽东思想，我可以上刀山，下火海；为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，我敢于消灭一切害人虫。”张春玉顶着风浪回到医院，和无产阶级革命派、革命群众一起，勇敢地投入对党内一小撮走资派的斗争。今年一月初，张春玉所在医院的一个部门实现了革命大联合。这个行动，有的说好得很，有的却不支持。开庆祝会那天，这个部门的无产阶级革命派邀请张春玉参加。他有些犹豫，担心支持错了影响不好。带着这个问题，他学习了毛主席《为人民服务》的教导和毛主席有关无产阶级文化大革命的最新指示，斗倒了“私”字，丢掉了“怕”字，毅然地参加了无产阶级革命派的庆祝会，对他们的革命行动表示了坚决支持。在这个部门的带动下，整个医院迅速实现了革命大联合。
    无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践教育了张春玉。他深深感到：在两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路的斗争中，容不得半点私心。只有斗倒了“私”字，才能无限忠于毛主席，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    张春玉两年多的病床生活是闪闪发光的。但是，对照毛主席的教导，他觉得还差得很远很远，他决心“从头越”，从零开始，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，努力地认真地学好用好“老三篇”，要以最大的自觉，最狠的决心，最高的标准，最严的要求，努力做一个斗私，批修的硬骨头战士，永远紧跟毛主席，赤胆忠心志不移。
    张春玉在光芒万丈的毛泽东思想的照耀下，正在思想革命化的大道上阔步前进。
