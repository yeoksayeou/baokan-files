When the revolutionary masses followed Chairman Mao's instructions and liberated cadres based on Party principles, what should cadres who had made mistakes of varying degrees do? Should they passively wait for the masses to liberate them, or should they actively engage in self-criticism and struggle against revisionism, go among the masses, sincerely open their hearts, bravely admit their mistakes, and resolutely correct them? Zhang Fucai, former chairman of the Supervisory Committee of Guangzhou Steel Plant (later transferred to the head of the scrap steel workshop as the branch secretary), chose the latter approach. He actively engaged in self-criticism and struggle against revisionism, bravely admitted his mistakes, corrected them, and gained the understanding and trust of the masses. Therefore, when the workshop established a revolutionary committee, the revolutionary masses entrusted him with the responsibility of being the leader of the revolutionary committee. He was deeply moved and said: Chairman Mao's great instruction to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" has truly liberated me!

In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, Zhang Fucai had implemented the reactionary bourgeois line, so the revolutionary masses had posted big-character posters about him and criticized him in meetings. At that time, he did not recognize the seriousness of his mistakes and was very resentful.

Soon, the revolutionary organizations in the scrap steel workshop, following Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling cadres, began to study the cadre issue. Zhang Fucai was in intense struggle at this time. He thought: As a cadre who had made mistakes and been criticized, should he passively wait for the masses to liberate him, or should he actively go among the masses, expose his thoughts to the masses, seek their help, and stand out to revolutionize?

Zhang Fucai repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on cadres. Chairman Mao's concern and care for cadres made his heart warm. He recalled the past and compared it to the present, and he was so moved that he couldn't sleep. Zhang Fucai was born into a tenant farmer's family and had suffered endless exploitation and oppression. It was only after liberation that he stood up. He thought: Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are my saviors. I should listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow him in revolution to the end! But today, in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I am full of grievances, working passively, and even ready to lie down and do nothing. This would make me a half-hearted revolutionary! After intense struggle, he realized that he should follow the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "correct mistakes promptly and thoroughly, the faster and more thorough the better," and continue to follow Chairman Mao in revolution to the end! Out of deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and a strong desire for thorough revolution, Zhang Fucai was full of confidence and determined to actively go among the masses, struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism with the masses, and stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Having the determination to go among the masses is not enough; one must also solve the problem of ideological understanding. Zhang Fucai seriously considered two questions: where he had gone wrong and why his thoughts were so far from the masses. He brought these two questions to his study of Chairman Mao's works. He thought that to truly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one should be like the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people" and the "model for supporting the left and loving the people" Comrade Li Wentong, doing what Chairman Mao loves, supporting what Chairman Mao supports, following Chairman Mao's instructions, and advancing when Chairman Mao waves his hand. Had he done this at the key moments of the Cultural Revolution? No. In the early stages of the movement, he had indeed stood on the opposite side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and made mistakes. After recognizing the nature of his mistakes, he felt very sad and heartbroken. Chairman Mao taught us: "We Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." It was completely right for him to accept the masses' criticism during the movement.

Just as Zhang Fucai began to recognize his mistakes, the revolutionary masses in the scrap steel workshop also came to help him warmly. A worker pointed out to him during a heart-to-heart talk: You eating, living, and working with us workers is a progress. But we hope you can think what the masses think and worry about what the masses worry about. Zhang Fucai felt that the worker's words were very reasonable. He thought: The masses helping him touch his soul was the greatest concern for him. Estimating himself wrongly would inevitably lead to treating the masses wrongly. After recognizing this, Zhang Fucai struggled hard against "selfishness" in his studies, freeing himself from "selfishness," truly thanking the revolutionary masses from the bottom of his heart for their education and help. In this way, he went from being opposed to the masses to being close to them, from lacking common language to having common language. At the same time, the masses also warmly helped him stand out to revolutionize.

### 广州钢铁厂原监委书记张福财是怎样站出来的？  主动到群众中去斗私批修

    广州钢铁厂原监委书记张福财是怎样站出来的？
    主动到群众中去斗私批修
    当广大革命群众遵循毛主席的教导，根据党性原则解放干部时，作为犯有不同程度错误的干部，是消极等待群众来解放呢，还是主动斗私批修，深入到群众中去，诚恳地向群众交心，大胆承认并坚决改正错误呢？广州钢铁厂原监委书记（后调废钢工场当支部书记）张福财，采取了后一种态度，主动斗私批修，大胆承认错误，改正错误，得到了群众的谅解和信任。因此，当工场成立革筹小组时，革命群众就把革筹小组负责人的担子交给了他。他万分激动地说：毛主席发出的“要斗私，批修”的伟大教导，使我获得了真正的解放！
    张福财在文化大革命运动初期执行过资产阶级反动路线，因此，革命群众曾贴过他的大字报，开会批判过他。当时，他没有认识到自己错误的严重性，很不服气。
    不久，废钢工场各革命群众组织遵照毛主席关于正确地对待干部的教导，着手研究干部问题。张福财这时思想斗争很激烈。他想：自己是一个犯错误、受批判的干部，究竟是消极等待群众来解放自己呢，还是自己主动地到群众里面去，把自己的思想同群众见面，取得群众的帮助，站出来革命呢？
    张福财反复学习了毛主席关于干部问题的教导。毛主席对干部的关怀、爱护，使他心里热呼呼的。他回忆起过去，对比着现在，激动得睡不着觉。张福财出生于一个雇农家庭，受尽了剥削和压迫。直到解放后，他才翻了身。他想：毛主席和共产党是自己的救命恩人，自己应该最听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席革命到底才对呀！可是今天，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，自己却满腹怨气，工作消极，还准备躺倒不干，这不就成了半截子革命了吗？经过反复的思想斗争，他想通了，应该遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好”的教导，继续紧跟毛主席革命到底！出于对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情和彻底革命的强烈愿望，张福财充满了信心，决心主动到群众里面去，和群众一道斗私批修，站到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    有了深入群众的决心还不行，还得解决思想认识问题。张福财认真考虑了两个问题，一是自己错在哪里；二是自己的思想为什么跟群众距离那么远？他带着这两个问题，重新学习毛主席著作。他想，真正站在毛主席革命路线上，就应当象“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志那样，做到“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”自己在文化大革命运动中的几个关键时刻，是不是这样做了呢？没有。自己在运动初期，的确是站在毛主席革命路线的对立面了，犯了错误。他认识到自己所犯错误的性质以后，感到很难过、很痛心。毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”自己在运动中接受群众的批判，是完全应该的。
    正当张福财对自己的错误有所认识的时候，废钢工场的革命群众也来热情地帮助他。有个工人在和他谈心时指出：你和我们工人同吃同住同劳动，这是一个进步。可是我们更希望你能想群众所想，急群众所急。张福财觉得这个工人的话很有道理。他想：群众帮助自己触及灵魂，是对自己的最大关心。错误地估价自己，必然会错误地对待群众。张福财认识到这一点以后，就在学习的过程中狠斗“私”字，使自己从“私”字中解放出来，真正从心坎里感谢革命群众对自己的教育和帮助。这样一来，他对群众从对立到亲近，从缺乏共同语言到有了共同语言。同时，群众也热情帮助他站出来革命。
