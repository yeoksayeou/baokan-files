In the glorious light of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, and amid the clarion call of the people of the whole country for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province has been born in victory. This is a rich fruit of implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and a brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Since the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the great leader Chairman Mao has always paid close attention to the Cultural Revolution in Hebei Province, personally inspecting Hebei, and at every crucial moment in the struggle, providing warm care and great guidance.

The 43 million heroic sons and daughters of Hebei who are by Chairman Mao's side have long been nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong, drawing boundless wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's great care and guidance. Over the past year, with the strong support and assistance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, they have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fought bravely, overcome countless difficulties, and repeatedly struggled with a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, smashing the various conspiracies of the class enemy to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from the right and the ultra-"left." They have won decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through more than a year of battles in the Cultural Revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat in Hebei Province has been further consolidated and strengthened.

The birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province is not only a great joy for the people of Hebei but also a great joy for the people of North China and the whole country. With this, all the provinces (municipalities) and autonomous regions in North China have established revolutionary committees. This not only declares the complete failure of the capitalist restoration plot of Khrushchev in China and his agents in Hebei but also deals a smashing blow to Khrushchev in China and his agents in North China.

On February 3, 400,000 revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from all over the province gathered in the "East is Red" Square in Shijiazhuang, filled with deep feelings of love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province.

At the moment of celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang City was even more vibrant and full of life. The whole city was adorned with red flags, drums beating, and firecrackers exploding. The revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participating in the celebration meeting carried a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, held red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and sang "The East is Red," shouting thousands and thousands of times: "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong! Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The broad masses of soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army received extremely enthusiastic welcome from the revolutionary masses. At the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the soldiers of the Hebei Provincial Military Region and the Hebei garrison, in response to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao to "support the broad masses of the left," stood firmly with the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat through thick and thin, fought shoulder to shoulder, and resolutely executed and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, making immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hebei Province. At the celebration meeting, the broad revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses expressed their heartfelt thanks to the People's Liberation Army for their support, repeatedly shouting excitedly: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army! Salute the People's Liberation Army!"

Comrade Li Xuefeng, the head of the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province, spoke at the celebration meeting. He said that the current situation in Hebei Province is excellent. From the foothills of the Taihang Mountains to the shores of the Bohai Sea, from the foot of the Yanshan Mountains to the banks of the Zhang River, a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions has surged. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism have become the unanimous action of the revolutionary people. The revolutionary big criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit are being carried out in depth. Revolutionary great unity has basically been achieved throughout the province, and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination is developing rapidly. Good news is frequently reported on all fronts of industry and transportation, and agricultural production in 1967 achieved an all-around bumper harvest, realizing self-sufficiency in grain. Comrade Li Xuefeng said: All our achievements and victories are gained under the wise leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, are the result of implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and are the victories of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

Comrade Li Xuefeng emphasized that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the most fundamental task is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, promote the revolutionization of people's ideology, and more extensively and deeply carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, so that Mao Zedong Thought can guide everything, transform everything, and promote everything, and turn the whole province into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Li Xuefeng said that the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every proletarian revolutionary fighter should become a model in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations should continue to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. With Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon and "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary big criticism, thoroughly eliminate all the poison of revisionism spread by Khrushchev in China and his agents. Mobilize the masses to do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit, reform education, reform literature and art, reform office work and administrative management work, and reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base. Smash bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Seriously study and deeply propagate Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, thoroughly criticize Khrushchev in China's revisionist party-building line, rectify the party organization, and strengthen party building. Further implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," and launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production.

Comrade Li Xuefeng called on the military and people of the whole province to further carry out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people, maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. All levels of revolutionary committees must establish a set of extremely revolutionary and extremely combative styles. The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses of the whole province should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, redouble their efforts, strive to be the best, and continue to make unremitting efforts to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

Comrade Zheng Weishan, a responsible comrade of the Beijing Military Region, and responsible comrades of the Hebei Military Region and the garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army in Hebei, Comrade Liu Zichou, the first deputy head of the provincial revolutionary committee, and deputy heads Comrades Ma Hui, Zeng Mei, Zhang Yinghui, Liu Dianchen, and Geng Changsuo, and committee members of the revolutionary committee, attended the celebration meeting.

Comrade Zheng Weishan, on behalf of the Party Committee and all the soldiers of the Beijing Military Region, expressed the highest respect and warmest congratulations to the revolutionary people of Hebei at the meeting. He pointed out in his speech that the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in North China. This is a great joy for the people of Hebei, and also a great joy for the people of North China and the whole country. This is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people, a smashing blow to Khrushchev in China and his agents in various places in North China, and a heavy blow to American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in North China fully proves the wise foresight of the great leader Chairman Mao during his inspection that "in a few more months, the overall situation will be even better."

Comrade Ma Hui, the commander of the Hebei Military Region and deputy head of the provincial revolutionary committee, and Comrade Chen Renhong, a responsible comrade of a certain unit of the garrison, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Hebei Military Region and all the soldiers of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Hebei, expressing the warmest congratulations and most resolute support for the victorious birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province. They said that in the "three supports and two militaries" work, we have deeply felt that the invincible thought of Mao Zedong is the lighthouse of progress, the source of strength, and the guarantee of victory. They expressed that in the future, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, better implement the principle of "supporting the left but not the faction," and do a better job in the "three supports and two militaries" work, contributing all our strength to achieving the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and turning Hebei Province into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives of the revolutionary committees of various prefectures in Hebei Province, representatives of revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, and Red Guards from various places spoke at the celebration meeting. They expressed that they would, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more extensively carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, continuously develop and consolidate revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The celebration meeting, amid thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers, passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a grand celebration parade was held.

    新华社石家庄四日电　在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在全国革命人民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的号角声中，河北省革命委员会胜利诞生了。这是落实毛主席一系列最新指示的丰硕成果，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的辉煌胜利！
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，伟大领袖毛主席一直非常关心河北省的文化大革命运动，亲临河北视察，在斗争的每一个关键时刻，都给予了亲切的关怀和伟大的教导。
    在毛主席身边的河北四千三百万英雄儿女，长期受到伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育，从毛主席的伟大关怀和教导中汲取了无穷无尽的智慧和力量。一年多来，他们在中国人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，英勇奋战，排除万难，同党内一小撮走资派反复较量，粉碎了阶级敌人从右的和极“左”的方面破坏无产阶级文化大革命的种种阴谋，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。经过一年多来文化大革命的战斗洗礼，河北省的无产阶级专政得到了进一步的巩固和加强。
    河北省革命委员会的胜利诞生，不仅是河北人民的大喜事，也是华北和全国人民的大喜事。至此，华北地区所有的省（市）和自治区都建立了革命委员会。这不但宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北代理人复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产，而且对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在华北的代理人是一个粉碎性的打击。
    二月三日，来自全省各地的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员四十万人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚感情，聚集在石家庄市的“东方红”广场内外，热烈庆祝河北省革命委员会光荣诞生。
    在欢庆河北省革命委员会诞生的时刻，石家庄市更加英姿焕发，生气勃勃，喜气洋洋。全市到处红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣。参加庆祝大会的革命群众和人民解放军指战员，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手执红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，千遍万遍地纵情欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    参加庆祝大会的中国人民解放军广大指战员，受到了广大革命群众极其热烈的欢迎。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的关键时刻，人民解放军河北省军区和河北驻军指战员，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，坚定地和无产阶级革命派风雨同舟，并肩奋战，坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为河北省无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。在庆祝大会上，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众衷心地感谢人民解放军的支持，激动地不断高呼：“向解放军学习！”“向解放军致敬！”
    河北省革命委员会主任李雪峰同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，当前河北省形势一片大好。从太行山麓到渤海之滨，从燕山脚下到漳河之畔，掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席最新指示的热潮。毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋般出现，斗私批修成为革命人民一致的行动。各条战线上的革命大批判和本单位的斗批改正在深入开展。全省范围内的革命大联合基本实现，革命的“三结合”迅速发展。全省工业交通战线捷报频传，农业生产一九六七年获得全面丰收，实现了粮食自给。李雪峰同志说：我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在伟大舵手毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是贯彻执行毛主席一系列最新指示的结果，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    李雪峰同志强调说，革命委员会成立以后，最根本的任务就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，促进人的思想革命化，更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动，让毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切，把全省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    李雪峰同志说，毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。每一个无产阶级革命战士都应该成为学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范。各级革命委员会，各革命群众组织，都要继续大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。要以毛主席的最新指示为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，继续深入开展革命的大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布的一切修正主义流毒。要放手发动群众，搞好本单位的斗批改，改革教育，改革文艺，改革机关工作和行政管理工作，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。要大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，加强无产阶级党性，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。要认真学习和深入宣传毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设。要进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，掀起工农业生产的新高潮。
    李雪峰同志号召全省军民，进一步开展拥军爱民运动，经常保持高度的革命警惕性，加强无产阶级专政。各级革命委员会必须树立起一套非常革命化、非常战斗化的作风。全省无产阶级革命派和革命群众要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！

  河北省军区司令员、省革命委员会副主任马辉同志和驻军某部负责人陈仁洪同志，分别代表河北省军区和陆海空三军驻河北全体指战员在大会上讲话，对河北省革命委员会的胜利诞生，表示最热烈的祝贺，最坚决的支持。他们说，在“三支”“两军”工作中，使我们更深刻地体会到：战无不胜的毛泽东思想是前进的灯塔，力量的源泉，胜利的保证。他们表示，今后一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，大力加强军民团结，更好地贯彻执行“支左不支派”的原则，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为把河北省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校贡献一切力量。
