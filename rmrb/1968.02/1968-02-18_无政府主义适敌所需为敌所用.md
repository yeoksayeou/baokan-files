Title: Anarchism Serves the Enemy's Needs and is Used by the Enemy

Anarchism, although its slogans change constantly, always adheres to the same principle: it strives to deny the authority of the proletariat, the new order of the revolution, and the discipline and organization of the proletariat. It advocates democracy but not centralization; freedom but not discipline; personal whims but not unified will. In a word, anarchism is extreme bourgeois individualism, where everything revolves around "me," and one does as one pleases. If allowed to develop, it will surely disperse our revolutionary organizations, undermine the fighting strength of our revolutionary ranks, damage the authority of the proletariat, weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat, and seriously hinder our comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All of this, isn't it precisely what suits the class enemy's attempt to restore capitalism, providing the class enemy with an "opening" to attack the proletariat?

The emergence of anarchist ideas is not accidental but a necessary reflection of the deepening class struggle, the struggle between two lines, and the struggle between two roads in the current new situation. A small handful of class enemies who refuse to perish are always "scouting for opportunities" to achieve their goals, attempting to split and shake the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and realize their evil goal of restoring capitalism. Anarchism is another guerrilla force used by the class enemy to restore capitalism. It coordinates with the bourgeoisie to attack the proletariat and can even achieve destructive effects that the enemy cannot directly achieve. Therefore, the class enemy always vigorously promotes and incites anarchist ideas within our revolutionary ranks, using the anarchist ideas that appear in our revolutionary ranks to sabotage the Cultural Revolution.

Over the past year, the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has fully proven this. That infamous counter-revolutionary two-faced scoundrel Tao Zhu, didn't he initially spread the reactionary slogan of "doubt everything, overthrow everything" of anarchism? Let comrades open their eyes and see: in those places where anarchist ideas are rampant today, who is fanning the flames and stirring up trouble? Who is benefiting and gloating? When you start making a big fuss about anarchism, isn't there someone who greets you with a smile, flatters you in front of you, incites you to deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought, and makes you more and more reckless? When you are in the midst of making a big fuss about anarchism, don't they immediately applaud and cheer for you, praising you as a "brave hero" and a "madman of the times," luring you to turn your guns on the proletarian headquarters? When your wrongdoings are criticized and resisted by comrades, and you are momentarily unable to understand, aren't these people the ones who incite you to continue sliding down the dangerous path?

This venomous snake of anarchism, in cahoots with the enemy, has done nothing but evil. We must rise up to surround and annihilate it, rise up to exterminate it. Wherever it pops up, we must strike it down there, until we completely defeat it!

### 无政府主义适敌所需为敌所用

专栏：各地报刊评论摘要

    无政府主义适敌所需为敌所用
    无政府主义者打出的旗号虽然变化无常，但却万变不离其宗，总是极力否定无产阶级权威，否定革命的新秩序和无产阶级的组织纪律，只要民主，不要集中；只要自由，不要纪律；只要个人随心所欲，不要统一意志。一句话，无政府主义是极端的资产阶级个人主义，一切以“我”为转移，为所欲为。任其发展下去，必然涣散我们革命组织，瓦解我们革命队伍的战斗力，损害无产阶级权威，削弱无产阶级专政，严重地阻碍着我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。这一切的一切，不恰恰是适应了阶级敌人妄图复辟资本主义的需要，为阶级敌人提供了向无产阶级进攻的“缺口”吗？
    无政府主义思潮的出现绝非偶然，而是当前新形势下两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争深化的必然反映。一小撮不甘心灭亡的阶级敌人，无时无刻不在“窥测方向”，“以求一逞”，妄图分裂和动摇以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，颠覆无产阶级专政，实现其复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。无政府主义就是阶级敌人用来复辟资本主义的又一支别动队，它配合资产阶级向无产阶级进攻，甚至可以起到敌人所无法直接起到的破坏作用。因此，阶级敌人总是极力向我们的革命队伍灌输和煽动无政府主义思潮，利用我们革命队伍中出现的无政府主义思潮来破坏文化大革命。
    一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，充分说明了这一点。那个臭名昭著的反革命两面派陶铸，当初不是拚命散布“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的无政府主义的反动口号吗？再请同志们擦亮眼睛看一看：在目前那些无政府主义思潮泛滥的地方，究竟什么人在点鬼火、煽阴风？什么人从中渔利、得意忘形？当你开始大闹无政府主义的时候，不是有人对你笑脸相迎，在你面前阿谀奉承，煽动你脱离毛泽东思想的轨道，让你越闹越凶吗？当你大闹无政府主义不可开交的时候，他们不是马上为你鼓掌喝彩，称赞你为“虎胆英雄”、“时代的狂人”，诱使你把炮口对准无产阶级司令部吗？当你的错误言行受到同志的批评、抵制，而你又一时想不通的时候，不又是这些人鼓动你沿着危险的道路继续滑下去吗？
    无政府主义这条毒蛇，同敌人狼狈为奸，干尽坏事。我们必须群起围歼之，群起而诛之，它在哪里冒出来，就在哪里把它打下去，直到把它彻底打倒为止！
