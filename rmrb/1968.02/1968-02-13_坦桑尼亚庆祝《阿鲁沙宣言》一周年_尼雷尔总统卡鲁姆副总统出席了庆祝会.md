About 40,000 Tanzanian youth held a grand rally and inspection in Dar es Salaam on the 5th to celebrate the first anniversary of the announcement of the Arusha Declaration in Tanzania. This declaration calls on the Tanzanian people to build the country through self-reliance.

Tanzanian President Nyerere attended the celebration and delivered a speech, calling on Tanzanian youth to actively participate in production and take up arms to defend Tanzania's independence in the spirit of the Arusha Declaration. He pointed out that "independence must be defended with force."

The youth participating in this rally came from all over Tanzania. Some of them carried hoes and sickles during the inspection to express their determination to build the country through self-reliance.

Tanzanian First Vice President Karume, in a speech at a youth rally in Zanzibar on the 5th to celebrate the first anniversary of the announcement of the Arusha Declaration, pointed out: "Every able-bodied Tanzanian must learn to defend his country with a gun."

Karume said that the people of Zanzibar and Pemba Island obtained their rights through struggle, not through constitutional means.

He emphasized: "Only through the gun can these rights be guaranteed." He pointed out: "Tanzania needs youth who are ready to fight against the enemy at any time."

Karume also said: "The Tanzanian government will strive to achieve the goals proposed by the Arusha Declaration and build Tanzania through self-reliance."

Before the rally, government leaders marched with thousands of Zanzibaris in a grand procession.
