The brave and skilled military and civilian forces of the southern plains provinces of South Vietnam have, in the first few days of the New Year, demonstrated the might of the people's war. Thousands of troops have been mobilized to launch a comprehensive offensive against the enemy, directly attacking the enemy's strongholds and striking down the American and puppet forces, leaving them in disarray and crying in pain. They have achieved earth-shaking new victories.

The military and civilian forces of Tuy Hoa Province bravely charged, launching a fierce attack on the American invaders in the Phu Yeu area, shattering the enemy's six counterattacks, engaging in close combat, annihilating over 800 American invaders, destroying 42 tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down two helicopters.
