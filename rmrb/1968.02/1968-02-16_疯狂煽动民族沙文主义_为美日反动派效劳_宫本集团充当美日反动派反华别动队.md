The revisionist group led by Gongsun has betrayed the Japanese revolutionary people and the international proletariat. Recently, they have been in cahoots with the Japanese reactionaries, loudly advocating the slogan of "defending one's own country," frenziedly inciting reactionary national chauvinism, and shamelessly selling out national interests to serve the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism and the expansionist policies of Japanese militarism. They have become a special action team for the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries against China. This has further exposed the traitorous face of the Gongsun group to the Japanese people and the people of the world.

The reactionary government of Japan, led by Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, has become even more brazen in serving the counter-revolutionary schemes of U.S. imperialism to invade China and Asia since his visit to the U.S. at the end of last year. He has been loudly shouting about the "nuclear threat" from China, threatening to "block China's influence," and has been arrogantly advocating the full revival of Japanese militarism under the pretext of "defending one's own country." At this critical moment, the Gongsun group has eagerly jumped out, publishing an article titled "The Security Policy of the Japanese Communist Party" in the January 8 issue of the *Red Flag*. This article is full of reactionary national chauvinism, echoing Sato's slogan of "defending one's own country," and is a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It is a blatant exposure of the Gongsun group's anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people counter-revolutionary face.

Everyone knows that Japan has become the largest military and logistical base for U.S. imperialism's invasion of China and Asia, serving as the U.S. imperialists' armory in Asia. Japan is a country ruled by the monopoly capitalist class, and the Sato reactionary government is the vanguard of U.S. imperialism's invasion of China and Asia. The Japanese people living under the iron hoofs of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have suffered tremendously and are in dire straits. It is under these circumstances that the Gongsun revisionist group has shamelessly put forward the slogan of "defending one's own country," deliberately inciting reactionary national chauvinist sentiments. Here, the Gongsun group has unwittingly admitted that the "country" they want to defend is Japan, which is under the semi-military occupation of the United States and ruled by the bourgeoisie. This clearly shows that the Gongsun group has completely surrendered to the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, betrayed the Japanese revolutionary people and the international proletariat, and shamefully fallen into the mire of national chauvinism.

The treacherous deeds of the Gongsun revisionist group have been highly praised by Sato. According to the Japanese bourgeois newspaper *Asahi Shimbun*, Sato, on February 6, loudly cheered for the Gongsun group at a meeting of the Japanese National Diet Budget Committee, saying: "Although I oppose communism, I support the self-defense theory and peaceful diplomacy of the Communist Party (referring to the Gongsun group)." Sato also said with great satisfaction: "I have listened to the various parties' explanations on the defense issue. I think the Communist Party's (referring to the Gongsun group) stance is relatively consistent." From Sato's self-satisfied demeanor, one can see how low the Gongsun group has fallen.

The Gongsun group's counter-revolutionary activities, despite being carefully disguised, cannot deceive the Japanese revolutionary people who are bravely fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and reaction. Instead, it has further exposed its traitorous face. The progressive publication *Labor Weekly* published an article on January 28 that exposed the Gongsun group's deceitful lies. The article said: "Sato is attempting to invade Asia. At this time, those who call themselves the 'Communist Party' are talking about having the 'right' to defend one's own country. This is nothing new. The gentlemen of the Second International have done this before. Let us bury the Soviet revisionists and Japanese revisionists and march towards world revolution!"

    疯狂煽动民族沙文主义　为美日反动派效劳
    宫本集团充当美日反动派反华别动队
    新华社东京十五日电  背叛了日本革命人民和国际无产阶级的宫本修正主义集团最近同日本反动派一唱一和，大肆鼓吹“保卫自己国家”的滥调，疯狂地煽动反动的民族沙文主义，不惜出卖民族利益，为美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策效劳，为日本军国主义对外扩张效劳，充当美日反动派的反华别动队。这就使宫本集团的叛徒嘴脸进一步暴露在日本人民和世界人民面前。
    日本反动政府首相佐藤荣作去年年底访美回国后，更加露骨地为美帝侵略中国和亚洲的反革命阴谋效劳。他大肆叫嚷中国的“核威胁”，扬言要“挡住中国的影响”，并且扯起了“自己保卫自己国家”的破旗，气焰嚣张地为加速全面复活日本军国主义大叫大嚷。正在这个时候，宫本集团迫不及待地跳了出来，在一月八日的《赤旗报》上发表了一篇所谓《日本共产党的安全保障政策》的文章。这篇文章大肆鼓吹反动的民族沙文主义，同佐藤唱的“自己保卫自己国家”的滥调毫无二致，彻头彻尾地背叛了马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，是宫本集团反华、反共、反人民的反革命面目的大暴露。
    大家都知道，日本早已成为美帝侵略中国和亚洲的最大的军事基地和后勤基地，成为美帝在亚洲的兵工厂。日本是垄断资本集团专政的国家，佐藤反动政府是美帝侵略中国和亚洲的急先锋。生活在美日反动派铁蹄下的日本人民受尽蹂躏，处在水深火热之中。宫本修正主义集团就是在这种情况下明目张胆地提出“保卫自己国家”的口号，蓄意煽动反动的民族沙文主义情绪。在这里，宫本集团不打自招地供认，它要“保卫”的国家就是处于美国半军事占领状态下的日本，是资产阶级专政的日本。这就清楚地表明，宫本集团已彻底地投降美日反动派，背叛了日本革命人民和国际无产阶级，可耻地滚到了民族沙文主义泥坑。
    宫本修正主义集团的叛卖行径得到了佐藤的倍加赞赏。据日本资产阶级报纸《朝日新闻》透露，佐藤二月六日在日本国会预算委员会会议上为宫本集团大声叫好，他说：“我虽然反对共产主义，但是我对共产党（按：应该说是宫本集团）的自主防卫论和和平外交论是赞成的。”佐藤还十分满意地说：“我听了各党关于防卫问题的种种说明。我认为共产党（指宫本集团）的主张是比较一贯的。”人们从佐藤的得意忘形的神态中可以看到，宫本集团已经堕落到何等的地步。
    宫本集团这一反革命勾当尽管经过了精心的乔装打扮，但绝欺骗不了同帝修反进行着英勇斗争的日本革命人民，相反地越加暴露了它的叛徒嘴脸。日本进步刊物《劳动周报》一月二十八日发表文章，一针见血地揭穿了宫本集团的骗人鬼话。文章说：“佐藤正在企图侵略亚洲。就在这时，打着‘共产党’幌子的家伙们，说什么有保卫自己国家的‘自卫权’，这并不是什么新货色。第二国际的绅士们就干过这种勾当。让我们把苏修、日修送进坟墓，向着世界革命前进！”
