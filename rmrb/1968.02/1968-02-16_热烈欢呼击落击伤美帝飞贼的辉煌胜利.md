The representatives waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted again and again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" These heroes, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, solemnly held celebration meetings and discussion meetings. Some went to the naval leadership to report the good news with drums and gongs. "Iron-hard soldiers of the Railway Corps" Zhang Chunyu, artillery active member studying Chairman Mao's works Li Enjiang, and armored forces' five-good soldier Shi Futing, who bravely saved the train, all pointed out at the meeting that the victory of the heroic naval air force shooting down and damaging one American bandit aircraft each is a new achievement after the naval air force held a conference of active members studying Chairman Mao's works.

They actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, fully implemented the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, and achieved this great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This victory is a punishment to the American imperialists who have been continuously provoking us militarily and is also support for the heroic Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national liberation.

No matter how cunning and ferocious the enemy is, they are just paper tigers in front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which is loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao with a heart of red. Good soldiers of Chairman Mao, Yang Dongshun, the former deputy squad leader of the class where Yang Dongshun and Lei Feng were, and active member studying Chairman Mao's works in the Chemical Defense Corps, Ding Xiuzhen, excitedly said that the heroic naval air force shot down the enemy aircraft and defeated the enemy with their loyal hearts to our great leader Chairman Mao.

At the celebration meeting, the representatives unanimously pointed out that this victory is a major victory of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and realizing the revolutionization of people's thinking. Representatives from the 834th Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory and the 12th Company of a certain unit in the Signal Corps shared their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, saying that as long as we occupy all positions with Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible in the world.

The representatives of active members studying Chairman Mao's works unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the heroic naval air force, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and make their contributions to defending the motherland and supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national liberation.
