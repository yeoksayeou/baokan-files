The People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison troops and the broad cadres and soldiers executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in Beijing have, since the 24th, carried out a "love the people propaganda week" centered on propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This has greatly strengthened military-civilian unity and powerfully promoted the victorious development of the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital. At present, the entire city of Beijing is filled with a fervor of military and civilian personnel jointly studying and propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everywhere, people are cheering: "Comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions!" "Achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution!" "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The most prominent feature of this "love the people propaganda week" is that the broad cadres and soldiers have gone deep into factories, rural people's communes, schools, and neighborhoods, and have thoroughly and meticulously propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions door-to-door. A certain unit's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team went to the suburban Four Seas Middle School and learned that although the school had achieved revolutionary unity, due to the interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, it affected the resumption of classes and the revolution. That night, the propaganda team convened a meeting with representatives from both factions and the united leadership, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary unity, conducted heart-to-heart talks, and helped them print and distribute "Propaganda Letters on Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions" to the students' parents, and issued a notice to resume classes overnight. The next day, the propaganda team also rehearsed and performed a series of cultural programs propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions and combating factionalism. On the third day, after most of the teachers and students returned to school, the propaganda team, with the spirit of "seizing the day" and the style of "continuous battle," organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the revolutionary teachers and students, thoroughly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, thoroughly exposed the crimes of factionalism, and established the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao. The heads of both factions and the broad revolutionary teachers and students said, "Chairman Mao's latest instructions have illuminated our hearts. We must learn from the PLA and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution." The propaganda team of a certain unit's First Company, which has been rated as a "four good" company for four consecutive years, went deep into the neighborhoods and learned that a female Red Guard from a middle school still had the thought of "unique revolution" after achieving revolutionary unity, always wanting to suppress the other side. The propaganda team members went to find this Red Guard and her mother to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, and raised her awareness. She said, "We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it." She went to school and actively made self-criticisms to the other side, actively promoting unity. The revolutionary committee of the city of Shunyi County's Chengguan People's Commune's Forward Brigade had poor unity among its directors. A certain unit's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team went to this brigade, separately helped them study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and then brought them together to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on self-criticism, making them actively criticize themselves. They jointly raised the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, they swore: "We will resolutely overcome factionalism and comprehensively implement Your latest instructions, and we will definitely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end."

During the "love the people propaganda week" activities, the military and civilian personnel of the capital, through jointly studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have become even more infinitely loving of the great leader Chairman Mao and even more closely united. The PLA, which is responsible for supporting the left in the Beijing Automobile Factory, adopted the methods of going out and inviting in to vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and widely solicit opinions from the masses. In addition to holding various types of symposiums, they also divided into four groups, visiting every household daily. They went to an old worker's home, and the first words they said upon entering the house were: "Chairman Mao sent us to visit you!" The two elderly people were very excited and said, "Thank you for Chairman Mao's care!" The PLA propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to them and also solicited their opinions. The old worker said, "You all have brought the work from the company to the home. Where in the world is there such a good army! This is all because Chairman Mao leads well. We must comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production." A member of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and a platoon leader from a certain unit, Liu Daruan, and three soldiers went to a resident's home. The first thing they did was to paste a portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall and wish the old lady long life with Chairman Mao! Then, the military and civilian personnel studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions together.

The responsible comrades of the Beijing Garrison and the various levels of leaders of the troops all personally participated in this love-the-people propaganda activity and widely solicited the revolutionary masses' opinions on the troops and the "three supports, two militaries" work.

    深入基层落实毛主席最新指示
    北京卫戍部队开展“爱民宣传周”，帮助群众组织克服派性，增强党性，有力地推动了革命的大联合和革命的三结合
    新华社三十一日讯　人民解放军北京卫戍区部队和在京执行“三支”“两军”任务的广大指战员，从二十四日开展以宣传毛主席最新指示为中心的“爱民宣传周”以来，大大加强了军民团结，有力地推动了首都的无产阶级文化大革命运动的胜利发展。目前，北京全市到处呈现一片军民一起学习、宣传毛主席最新指示，全面落实毛主席最新指示的热潮，到处都在欢呼：“全面落实毛主席的最新指示！”“夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    这次“爱民宣传周”的最显著特点，是广大指战员深入到工厂、农村人民公社、学校、街道等基层单位，扎扎实实挨门挨户地宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示。某部毛泽东思想宣传队来到京郊四海中学，了解到这个学校虽然实现了革命大联合，但是由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪，影响了复课闹革命。当天晚上，宣传队就召集两派学生代表、联合领导班子开座谈会，反复学习毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示，进行交心、谈心活动，并且帮助他们连夜印发“毛主席最新指示宣传信”，送给学生家长，连夜发出复课通知。第二天，宣传队又赶排了一批宣传毛主席最新指示、打倒派性的文艺节目，进行宣传。第三天，绝大多数师生来校以后，宣传队又以“只争朝夕”的精神和“连续作战”的作风，和革命师生一起办起毛泽东思想学习班，大学毛主席的最新指示，大摆派性的罪状，大立毛主席倡导的革命好学风。两派头头和广大革命师生说，毛主席的最新指示把我们的心照亮了。我们一定要向解放军学习，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。连续四年被评为四好连队的某部一连毛泽东思想宣传队，深入街道，了解到住在这里的一名中学红卫兵在实现了革命大联合以后，仍有“唯我独革”的思想，总想压倒对方。宣传队同志就去找这个红卫兵和她妈妈一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起斗私批修，提高了这个红卫兵的认识。她说，我们是毛主席的红卫兵，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。她到学校里，主动找对方作了自我批评，积极搞好团结。顺义县城关人民公社前进大队革命委员会正副主任团结得不够好。某部毛泽东思想宣传队来到这个大队，分别帮助他们学习毛主席的最新指示，然后又把他们两人找到一起，学习毛主席关于多作自我批评的最新指示，使他们各自主动作了自我批评，共同举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，在毛主席像前宣誓：我们要坚决克服派性，把您的最新指示条条落实、全面落实，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在“爱民宣传周”活动中，首都军民通过共同学习、落实毛主席的最新指示，更加无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加亲密团结。在北京市人民汽车公司担负支左工作的解放军，采取走出去，请进来的方法，大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，广泛征求群众的意见。他们除召开各种类型的座谈会外，还分成四个组，每天深入到职工家里挨门挨户访问。他们来到一个老工人家里，进屋第一句话就说：“毛主席叫我们看望您来啦！”两位老人非常激动地说：“感谢毛主席的关怀！”解放军向他们宣传了毛主席的最新指示，又向他们征求意见。老工人说：您们把工作从公司做到家里，世界上那有这样好的军队！这都是毛主席领导得好，我们一定要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产。北京市革命委员会委员、某部排长刘大乱和三个战士来到一户居民家，第一件事就是在墙上张贴毛主席像，同老大娘共同祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！接着军民一起学习了毛主席的最新指示。
    北京卫戍区负责人和部队的各级领导干部都亲自参加了这次爱民宣传活动，并广泛征求革命群众对部队和“三支”“两军”工作的意见。
