In the struggle to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the provinces of Shaanxi and the city of Xi'an have promoted revolutionary great alliances and three-in-one combinations through the establishment of numerous Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The situation is excellent. Currently, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses are continuing to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, launching a "people's war" to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, further consolidating and developing revolutionary great alliances, and promoting three-in-one combinations.

With the help of the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi, extensive and in-depth campaigns to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions have been carried out in urban and rural areas throughout Shaanxi Province and the city of Xi'an. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established throughout the province, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions are increasingly being grasped by the broad masses and turned into conscious actions. So far, tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established in urban and rural areas throughout the province, with several million revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses participating in the study.

The great power of Mao Zedong Thought has powerfully promoted the development of revolutionary great alliances and three-in-one combinations. Currently, in five of the eight districts and one city in the province, revolutionary great alliances have been achieved; revolutionary committees or revolutionary committee preparatory groups have been established in a number of counties. The working class in the Xi'an region has played a leading role, taking the lead in the wave of revolutionary great alliances. Currently, revolutionary great alliances have been achieved in the railway, textile, power, and transportation systems in the Xi'an region. More than 60% of the large and medium-sized factories and enterprises in the city have achieved revolutionary great alliances.

The revolutionary cadres and broad revolutionary masses in various parts of the province are seriously engaged in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, and seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. Batch after batch of revolutionary cadres have come forward to participate in the revolution. Many provincial and municipal department heads and above have been enrolled in provincial and municipal cadre Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They are studying Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions in the study classes, engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, eliminating private interests and establishing public interests, strictly demanding of themselves, correctly handling their own mistakes, correctly handling revolutionary masses, and further understanding Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

To further promote the current excellent revolutionary situation to develop rapidly, the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Great Alliance Consultative Conference recently held a plenary meeting and decided to further mobilize the revolutionary cadres and broad revolutionary masses throughout the province to launch a massive campaign to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promote and consolidate revolutionary great alliances and three-in-one combinations. Currently, this mass movement has reached a high tide throughout the province. The two factions in large enterprises such as the Red Flag Machinery Factory, Northwest Optical Instrument Factory, and Qing'an Company in the Xi'an region, which have been fighting "internal wars" for a long time, have recently achieved and consolidated revolutionary great alliances. Sixty-six cadres from the Yu Hua Commune in Xi'an City, with the help of poor and lower-middle peasants, have already had sixty-four cadres come forward to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, making the revolution and production of this commune better and better.

    毛泽东思想学习班推动了革命大联合和三结合
    陕西全省办起数以万计的学习班，毛主席最新指示越来越为广大群众所掌握，围剿派性的群众运动广泛展开
    据新华社西安十五日电　在全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，陕西省和西安地区通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，促使革命大联合和革命三结合的浪潮滚滚向前，形势空前大好。目前，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众正在继续大办毛泽东思想学习班，发起一场围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，以进一步巩固和发展革命大联合，促进革命三结合。
    在人民解放军陕西驻军广大指战员的帮助下，陕西省和西安地区广大城乡，广泛深入地开展了一个以学习毛主席最新指示为中心的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，全省各地普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班，毛主席的最新指示越来越为广大群众所掌握，变为群众的自觉行动。到目前为止，全省城乡已办起了数以万计的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的革命群众和革命干部有几百万人。
    毛泽东思想的巨大威力，有力地推动了革命大联合和革命三结合的发展。现在，在全省八个专区一个市中，已有五个专区和一个市实现了革命的大联合；有一批县建立了革命委员会或革命委员会筹备小组。西安地区的工人阶级发挥主力军的作用，一马当先，走在革命大联合浪潮的前面。目前，西安地区的铁路、纺织、电力、交通运输等系统，已实现了革命大联合。全市实现革命大联合的大中型工厂企业，已占总数的百分之六十以上。
    全省各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，认真地斗私批修，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，认真落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，一批批的革命干部站出来革命。大批省市厅局长以上的领导干部被吸收到省市干部毛泽东思想学习班学习。他们在学习班里认真学习毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，破私立公，严格要求自己，正确对待自己所犯的错误，正确对待革命群众，对毛主席的革命路线有了进一步的理解。
    为了推动当前的大好革命形势更加突飞猛进地向前发展，陕西省革命大联合协商代表会最近召开全体会议，决定要进一步广泛深入地动员全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，发动一场声势浩大的围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，增强无产阶级党性，进一步全面落实毛主席最新指示，促进和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合。目前，这个群众运动已在全省各地形成高潮。西安地区的红旗机械厂、西北光学仪器厂、庆安公司等大型工厂企业的两派群众组织，过去长时期打“内战”，最近实现和巩固了革命的大联合。西安市鱼化公社的六十六名社队干部，在贫下中农的帮助下，已有六十四个干部站出来，挑起革命和生产两副重担，使这个公社的革命和生产搞得越来越好。
