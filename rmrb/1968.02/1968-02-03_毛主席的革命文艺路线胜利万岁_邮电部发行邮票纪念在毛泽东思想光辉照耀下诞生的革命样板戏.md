The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has issued a commemorative stamp set titled "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line on Literature and Art" to celebrate the revolutionary model operas born under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

A Xinhua News Agency report on February 2nd stated that the commemorative stamp set "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line on Literature and Art" began its circulation on January 30th.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, after watching "Adventurers in the Water Margin," wrote a letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe on January 9, 1944, pointing out: "History is created by the people, but in the old-style stage performances (and in all literature and art that are detached from the people), the people are reduced to mere dregs, while the stage is dominated by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being corrected by you, restoring history to its true face. From now on, traditional drama has a new lease on life, and this is worth celebrating."

Under the radiant guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, eight revolutionary model operas were born—Beijing operas "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Sha Jianhu," "The Harbor," and "Ambush on the White Tiger Regiment"; ballets "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl"; and the symphony "Sha Jianhu." These operas prominently praise the historical masters—the workers, peasants, and soldiers—and once again invert the history that was inverted by the exploited classes. Since their performances, these eight revolutionary model operas have been highly praised by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who have enthusiastically acclaimed them. They are praised for setting a brilliant example for the development of proletarian revolutionary literature and art. They are hailed as a brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided to issue the commemorative stamp set "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line on Literature and Art" to commemorate this great victory. This set consists of nine designs, printed in color using the photogravure method, each with a face value of eight fen. The first six designs have begun circulation on January 30th, and the remaining three will be issued at a later date.

The nine designs in this set are as follows:

1. Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line on Literature and Art
2. Revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Red Lantern"
3. Revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy"
4. Revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Sha Jianhu"
5. Revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Harbor"
6. Revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Ambush on the White Tiger Regiment"
7. Ballet "The Red Detachment of Women"
