According to Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, February 16th – The East is Red Song and Dance Troupe performed revolutionary songs and dances for the first time in the evening of the 15th in the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka.

After watching the performance, a young man excitedly told the Chinese artists, "Your revolutionary song and dance is very profound. The song 'We Stand with Our Vietnamese Brothers' reflects your determination to fight against American imperialism. This is also my determination, and the determination of all people around the world." He shouted, "Down with American imperialism!"

The Education Minister of East Pakistan, Anzard Hossain, who presided over the opening ceremony of this performance, delivered a speech. He expressed his great admiration for China's Cultural Revolution.

    我歌舞团在达卡首次演出受到热烈欢迎
    观众高呼：毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    据新华社达卡十六日电　中国东方红歌舞团十五日晚上在东巴基斯坦省首府达卡首次演出革命歌舞。每当天幕上出现金光闪闪的毛主席像的时候，当每个节目演完之后，观众热烈鼓掌并一再高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”并高呼：“英雄的越南人民万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”
    演出结束之后，许多巴基斯坦朋友到中国艺术工作者那里去索取毛主席像章和红色宝书《毛主席语录》。
    到场的观众达八千多人，其中有巴基斯坦中央政府的一些部长、东巴基斯坦省政府的高级官员、工人、农民、学生等。
    一位名叫雅辛的巴基斯坦朋友带领全家从一百八十多英里以外的地方赶来看中国的革命歌舞演出。
    看了演出之后，一位青年兴奋地对中国艺术工作者说，你们演出的革命歌舞意义很深刻。歌曲《我们同越南兄弟站在一起》反映了你们向美帝国主义作斗争的决心，这也是我的决心，也是全世界人民的决心。他高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”
    主持这次演出开幕式的东巴基斯坦省政府教育部长安扎德·侯赛因发表了讲话。他表示对中国的文化大革命怀着极大的钦佩之情。
    中国东方红歌舞团二月十四日从西巴基斯坦拉合尔坐飞机到达达卡。在机场上热烈地欢迎这个歌舞团的许多工人和学生，胸前佩戴着毛主席像章，挥着红色宝书《毛主席语录》。有的高举着毛主席画像，有的挥动着旗子，上面用孟加拉文和中文写着“巴基斯坦人民和中国人民之间的友谊万岁”的口号。
