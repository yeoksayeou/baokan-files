During the Fourth Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought of the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, the representatives, with great enthusiasm, thoroughly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on rectifying the party organization: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy." Everyone unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions represent a new development in the Marxist-Leninist theory of party building, a great program for our party rectification, and the most powerful ideological weapon for criticizing the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Based on widespread study, the conference presidium convened a discussion meeting with some representatives to criticize the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev. At the meeting, the representatives, combining their personal experiences and deep feelings, enthusiastically sang the praises of the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line and deeply exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the revisionist party-building line. The representatives said: Great Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our party's construction. The Chinese Khrushchev attempts to castrate this soul and change the nature of our party. We will not agree to this, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways.

The representatives, with boundless pride and excitement, pointed out: Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the highest leader of our party. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in our time, the guiding ideology of our party. Chairman Mao personally determined the party-building program of our party, formulated the political and organizational lines of our party, established the organizational principles of democratic centralism, advocated the three great styles of our party, and in a series of issues related to party building, he brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. Great Mao Zedong Thought will forever be the theoretical foundation guiding our party and the soul of our party's construction.

Lenin pointed out: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." "Only a party guided by advanced theory can play the role of an advanced detachment." "If the party is dominated by the ideas of revisionism, it will no longer be a socialist party of the working class." The history of the international communist movement has proven that Lenin's statements are great truths. The Communist Party of China is a great, glorious, and correct proletarian revolutionary party, becoming the pillar of the international communist movement in contemporary times, precisely because our party, under the personal leadership and cultivation of the greatest leader of the contemporary proletariat, Chairman Mao, has waged uncompromising struggles against "left" and right opportunism and has always adhered to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of our party.

The representatives angrily pointed out that the Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the party and has used despicable methods to viciously attack the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. He openly denies Chairman Mao's highest leadership position in the party. He has done everything possible to obstruct the entire party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country from carrying out the mass movement of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese Khrushchev's hatred of Mao Zedong Thought is just like Bernstein, Kautsky, and Khrushchev's hatred of Marxism and Leninism, all stemming from counter-revolutionary class instincts. The traitors of the proletariat fully understand that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the soul of the revolutionary party of the proletariat. Once this soul is removed, the nature of the party as a vanguard of the proletariat can be changed, realizing their evil plot to seize the party.

The representatives reviewed the history of our party and pointed out that within our party, there has always been a struggle between two party-building lines: one is Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, and the other is the revisionist party-building line promoted by all opportunists in the history of our party. The Chinese Khrushchev is the most concentrated representative of this revisionist party-building line. The fundamental difference between these two party-building lines is whether or not to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the party. The struggle between the two party-building lines has always revolved around this fundamental difference. In the struggle between the two party-building lines, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, has always stood on the side of the great leader Chairman Mao, consistently adhered to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the party, and most loyally, resolutely, and bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line. He has waged unyielding struggles against all "left" and right opportunists within the party. He has firmly defended Chairman Mao's highest leadership position and called for the party to unite around Chairman Mao and around Mao Zedong Thought. He called for the party to unite around Chairman Mao and to strive to learn and master Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought the guiding principle for all the party's work. Vice Chairman Lin has made outstanding contributions to the construction of our party and has set a brilliant example for the entire party. The history of the struggle between the two party-building lines within the party fully proves that adhering to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the party is adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, which can make our party always maintain the nature of a vanguard of the proletariat, lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to carry the socialist revolution to the end, and carry the world revolution to the end. Opposing Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the party will inevitably lead to the promotion of the revisionist party-building line, causing our party to degenerate into a revisionist party, a fascist party. This is absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, adhering to or opposing Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the party is a major issue concerning the nature and direction of our party, a major issue concerning the future and destiny of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The representatives declared: Chairman Mao will forever be the highest leader of our party, and great Mao Zedong Thought will forever be the guiding ideology of our party. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, who opposes Mao Zedong Thought, is a traitor to the Chinese revolution, a traitor to the world revolution, and a traitor to the cause of communism. We will exterminate them with the entire party and condemn them with the entire country.

The representatives deeply felt from the history of our party's victorious development that Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist political line, formulated in various historical periods of the Chinese revolution, has pointed out the only correct direction for the construction of our party. Our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of our time. He stands the highest, sees the farthest, and is best at proposing the most correct political line in extremely complex and difficult situations, guiding us from victory to victory. The process of our party's construction is closely linked to the implementation of Chairman Mao's political line. Whenever Chairman Mao's political line is smoothly implemented, our party develops, advances, and wins victories; whenever Chairman Mao's political line is sabotaged, our party shrinks, retreats, and fails; even if it is merely disrupted, it will cause great damage to the construction of the party. The process of our party's construction is the process of the victory of Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist political line over "left" and right opportunist lines. Our party has developed and consolidated along the political line of Chairman Mao.

In the period of the democratic revolution, when Chairman Mao spoke of the relationship between the party's political line and the party's construction, he pointed out profoundly that the process of party construction is closely linked to the problems of the united front and armed struggle.

Chairman Mao said: "An important part of the political line of the Communist Party of China is the political line of uniting with the bourgeoisie and struggling against it. An important part of the party construction of the Communist Party of China is the development and tempering of the party in the process of uniting with the bourgeoisie and struggling against it." It is precisely because our party, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, in the process of forming a united front with the bourgeoisie, adhered to the principle of independence and firmly grasped the leadership of the revolution; and when the united front was forced to break up, it waged a resolute armed struggle against the bourgeoisie. This ensured the consolidation and development of our party in thought, politics, and organization, achieving a thorough victory in the democratic revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed and distorted Chairman Mao's correct policy on the united front, advocating class capitulationism and openly demanding that the Communist Party give up the leadership of the united front. The Chinese Khrushchev's line of capitulationism is to turn our party into a lackey of the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao said: "An important part of our political line is armed struggle." "Without armed struggle, without guerrilla warfare, we cannot understand our political line, nor can we understand the construction of our party." It is precisely because our party, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has undergone a long period of armed struggle, defeating the ferocious enemies at home and abroad, that we have established and consolidated a state of proletarian dictatorship, tempering our party into an extremely strong proletarian revolutionary party. The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed the road of armed seizure of power, especially after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, on the eve of the decisive battle between the two destinies and two futures of China, he put forward the infamous "new stage of peaceful democracy," demanding that our party hand over the army to the Kuomintang and abandon armed struggle, engaging in "parliamentary struggle." The Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist political line is to turn our party into a bourgeois reform party.

In the period of the socialist revolution, the fundamental issue of our party's political line is to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Chairman Mao teaches us: In this historical stage of socialism, it is necessary to persist in the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry the socialist revolution to the end in order to prevent the restoration of capitalism, carry out socialist construction, and prepare the conditions for the transition to communism. Without class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat and without the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is impossible to understand the construction of the party in the socialist period. It is precisely because our party has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's political line that our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved brilliant victories, greatly strengthening the revolutionary construction of our party. The Chinese Khrushchev has always advocated the theory of "extinction of class struggle," opposed the socialist revolution, opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempted to drag China back to the old road of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism. The Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist political line is to turn our party into a revisionist party, a fascist party.

The representatives unanimously pointed out that the experience of our party's construction over the decades shows that the most important thing to build our party into a genuine proletarian revolutionary party is to implement Chairman Mao's political line formulated for our party. Chairman Mao's political line is the line of continuous and thorough revolution of the proletariat, reflecting the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the concentrated embodiment of the will of the proletariat. Therefore, establishing the dominant position of Chairman Mao's political line within the party is of paramount importance for our party to always maintain the nature of a vanguard of the proletariat. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would resolutely implement and defend to the death Chairman Mao's political line. To realize Chairman Mao's political line, we will dare to climb mountains of swords and cross seas of fire, and will not hesitate to sacrifice our lives.

The representatives deeply felt that to enable our party to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, to carry the socialist revolution to the end, and to advance the world communist movement to victory, we must follow Chairman Mao's instruction: "To grasp ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles," and use Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members, raising the consciousness of the vanguard of the proletariat. This is the primary task of party construction.

The representatives pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of our time for transforming people's souls, the most scientific, most complete, and most concentrated embodiment of the worldview of the proletariat. Adhering to or opposing the use of Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members is the question of whether to use the worldview of the proletariat or the worldview of the bourgeoisie to transform our party, a question concerning the direction of our party's ideological construction. Using Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members is to unify the thoughts and actions of the whole party with Mao Zedong Thought. Using Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to overcome various non-proletarian thoughts within the party, making party members firmly establish the worldview of the proletariat, continuously raise their consciousness of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and become advanced elements of the proletariat who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are closely connected with the masses, and are full of revolutionary spirit. Using Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members is to use Chairman Mao's five conditions for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause to cultivate and train successors of the revolutionary cause. "This is an extremely important issue concerning the life and death of our party and state. This is a major undertaking for the hundred, thousand, and ten thousand years of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

The Chinese Khrushchev, to corrupt and disintegrate our party ideologically, has always opposed the use of Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members. He openly forbade the use of Chairman Mao's works as basic textbooks for educating party members, opposed the use of Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental basis for building party branches, and attempted to turn party branches into "clubs" for eating, drinking, and playing. He vigorously promoted the black "Cultivation" that advocates no class struggle, no revolution, and no dictatorship of the proletariat, enthusiastically advocated the ideological garbage of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and vigorously promoted the worldview of bourgeois individualism, advocating the slave mentality that strangles the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, attempting to corrupt the souls of party members, disintegrate the party's organization, and turn our party into a revisionist party, becoming a tool for his restoration of capitalism. The representatives said that the more frantically the Chinese Khrushchev opposes the use of Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members, the more we must strive a thousand times, ten thousand times to learn Mao Zedong Thought, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The representatives explained with their own experiences that in the new stage of the socialist revolution, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate party members and making party members establish the thought of thorough revolution of the proletariat has special importance for the current construction of the party. The socialist revolution not only requires a thorough break with all private ownership but also a thorough break with all old traditional ideas that arise with private ownership. The more the revolution advances, the more prominent the conflict between the proletariat's "public" and the bourgeoisie's "private" becomes. Only by seriously tempering oneself and consciously eliminating the private and establishing the public in the great storms of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can one deeply understand Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and lead the masses well, carrying the socialist revolution to the end. The representatives expressed that they would definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "fight the self and criticize revisionism," follow Vice Chairman Lin's instruction: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution and at the same time constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution," study and apply the "Old Five Articles," thoroughly eliminate the pernicious influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "fusion of public and private" and "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," enhance proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, explode a revolution in the depths of the soul, thoroughly eliminate the "private" and establish the "public," establish a communist worldview of wholeheartedly and lifelong dedication to the public, and let Mao Zedong Thought become the soul that commands every second of life.

The lessons of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique's restoration of capitalism tell us that when a proletarian party degenerates into a bourgeois party, the nature of the state power will necessarily degenerate from the dictatorship of the proletariat to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. All class enemies, to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, first of all want to change the nature of the proletarian party and change the nature of Communist Party members. Only by arming the minds of all party members with Mao Zedong Thought can we effectively prevent and oppose revisionism, always maintain the nature of a proletarian revolutionary party, and enhance the party members' ability to identify and resist revisionism; even if revisionism emerges, party members will rise up to rebel against them and smash their plots of restoration.

The representatives pointed out that the sharp and complex class struggles in society inevitably reflect within our party. Various non-proletarian thoughts constantly infiltrate our party's organization, and a few party members with weak willpower may degenerate and change their nature under the corruption of the exploiting class's thoughts. Class enemies will also use various means to infiltrate our party's ranks and sabotage us from within. Therefore, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, actively carrying out struggles within the party, and continuously rectifying the party's organization are important guarantees for our party to maintain its purity in thought, politics, and organization, and to continuously consolidate and develop.

The great leader Chairman Mao has deeply analyzed the social and ideological roots of struggles within the party and expounded on the great significance of struggles within the party for the construction of the party. Chairman Mao said: "The opposition and struggle between different thoughts within the party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of the class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within society in the party. If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the party, the life of the party will also stop." The struggle between the two lines within the party is the most concentrated, prominent, and sharp reflection of class struggle within the party. In the struggle between the two lines within the party, our party, following Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, has strictly distinguished between two types of contradictions. For those class enemies who have infiltrated the party and those who insist on erroneous lines and refuse to repent, we will resolutely struggle against them to the end and expel them from the party. For comrades who have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, as long as they are not persistent in their errors and unrepentant, we will unite and educate them, following Chairman Mao's teachings, adopting the policy of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity," "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the person." On the one hand, we will wage a serious struggle against erroneous thoughts, and on the other hand, we will fully give those who have made mistakes the opportunity to awaken themselves, thereby achieving the dual purpose of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades. Chairman Mao often teaches us: "In handling problems of people, we should take a cautious attitude, neither being vague and evasive nor harming comrades. This is one of the signs of our party's prosperity and strength." Precisely because our party has adhered to the correct policies and methods for struggles within the party as stipulated by Chairman Mao, we have continuously defeated the "left" and right opportunist lines, strengthened the unity of the whole party on the basis of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and made our party more united, more consolidated, and more solid in thought, politics, and organization.

The representatives emphasized that Chairman Mao's great theory on rectification movements is an extremely outstanding and creative contribution to the Marxist-Leninist theory of party building. Our party, through various rectification movements, has greatly raised the level of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the party, rectified the "left" and right opportunist lines, overcome erroneous thoughts within the party, and purified the ranks of the party. The great rectification movements have enabled our party to maintain a thorough revolutionary spirit and a vigorous fighting style, ensuring the thorough victory of the revolutionary war and the great victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed Chairman Mao's theory on struggles within the party and the correct policies for rectifying the party organization. He advocates "peace within the party," abolishing struggles within the party. He covers up the class nature of struggles within the party and obliterates the struggle between the two lines within the party. He sabotages the rectification movements of the party and distorts the correct policies of the rectification movements. While he preaches "peace," he wages "ruthless struggle and merciless blows" against those who insist on the correct line, and in the matter of cadres, he promotes the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique." The Chinese Khrushchev does this to allow bourgeois thoughts to freely spread within the party, to protect the traitors, spies, and a handful of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the party, to promote his counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and to realize his evil goal of seizing the party.

The representatives stressed that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary movement carried out under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and is also a great mass rectification movement of the party. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party are the main targets of the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Fully exposing them, thoroughly criticizing them, and resolutely overthrowing them is the main issue to be resolved in this cultural revolution and is also an important task for rectifying the party organization. In this movement, hundreds of millions of people have risen up to rebel against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, seizing back the power that had been usurped by them and returning it to the hands of the proletariat, completely smashing the bourgeois command center headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and exposing the bourgeois representatives and traitors and spies hidden within our party. In the movement, the vast majority of party members have received the greatest tempering and the deepest education, and many new backbone forces have emerged, saving cadres who have made mistakes. The Cultural Revolution has cultivated a large number of proletarian advanced elements who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, creating unprecedentedly good conditions for the development and strengthening of the party's ranks. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line. The representatives excitedly talked about how, at the moment we are welcoming the all-around victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions on rectifying the party organization, which has greatly inspired and educated us. We must repeatedly study, deeply understand, and promptly implement these instructions, resolutely carrying out the combat tasks of rectifying the party organization and strengthening the construction of the party. We must make our party more pure, more powerful, more consolidated, and more vigorous, forever maintaining the bright red color of a proletarian revolutionary party.

The representatives felt that Chairman Mao's great teaching is a deeply profound summary of the experience of the international communist movement. Whether in the past, present, or future, whether a country's revolution can develop and win depends on whether there is a proletarian revolutionary party.

Now, the world has entered an era where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory, entering a new era of revolution with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. More and more revolutionary people around the world are mastering and using Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful ideological weapon, with the momentum of overturning mountains and the force of thunder, launching an unprecedented great struggle against the old world that is setting and gasping for breath. The revolutionary situation in the world is excellent and getting better. However, the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in response to the needs of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries, has turned the proletarian parties of many countries into revisionist parties and tail parties of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the most important and urgent glorious combat task facing us Marxist-Leninists is to hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize modern revisionism, and struggle to build a genuine proletarian revolutionary party.

The representatives firmly believe that as long as we strengthen the construction of the party according to the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely be able to make our party forever become a vigorous vanguard organization leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy. We will definitely be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary people to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, building a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without the system of exploitation. The invincible and brilliant great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will forever fly high in the world, flying in victory!

    伟大的毛泽东思想是建设无产阶级革命党的灵魂
    ——总参谋部第四次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会代表批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线座谈会纪要
    在中国人民解放军总参谋部第四次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会期间，代表们以极大的热情，深入地学习了毛主席关于整顿党组织的最新指示：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”大家一致认为，毛主席这一最新指示，是对马克思列宁主义建党学说的新发展，是我们整党的伟大纲领，是批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线最强大的思想武器。在普遍学习的基础上，大会主席团召开了有部分代表参加的批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线座谈会。会上，代表们结合亲身经历和切身体会，热情歌颂毛主席无产阶级建党路线的伟大胜利，深刻揭露、批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义建党路线的滔天罪行。代表们说：伟大的毛泽东思想是我党建设的灵魂，中国赫鲁晓夫妄图阉割这个灵魂，改变我党的性质，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
        坚持还是反对以毛泽东思想作
    为党的指导思想，是两条建党路线
      的根本分歧
    代表们以无比自豪、无比激动的心情指出：毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是我们党的最高领袖。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是我们党的指导思想。毛主席亲自确定了我党的建党纲领，规定了我党的政治路线和组织路线，制定了我党民主集中制的组织原则，倡导了我党的三大作风，在党的建设的一系列问题上，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。伟大的毛泽东思想永远是指导我们党的理论基础，永远是我们党建设的灵魂。
    列宁指出：“没有革命理论，就不会有坚强的社会主义政党”，“只有以先进理论为指南的党，才能实现先进战士的作用”，“如果在党内，修正主义者的思想真的占了上风，那就不是工人阶级的社会主义政党了”。国际共产主义运动的历史，证实了列宁的这些论断是千真万确的伟大真理。中国共产党所以是伟大的、光荣的、正确的无产阶级革命党，成为当代国际共产主义运动的中流砥柱，就是因为我们党在当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖毛主席亲自领导和培育下，同“左”、右倾机会主义作了毫不调和的斗争，始终坚持了以毛泽东思想作为我党的指导思想。
    代表们愤怒指出，中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对以伟大的毛泽东思想作为党的指导思想，并用卑劣的手法，恶毒攻击伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想。他公然否定毛主席在全党的最高领袖地位。他千方百计地阻挠全党、全军和全国人民开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。中国赫鲁晓夫如此仇视毛泽东思想，正象伯恩斯坦、考茨基、赫鲁晓夫之流仇视马克思主义、仇视列宁主义一样，都是出于反革命的阶级本能。无产阶级的叛徒们十分懂得，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命党的灵魂，抽掉了这个灵魂，就可以改变党的无产阶级先锋队的性质，实现他们篡党的罪恶阴谋。
    代表们回顾了我们党的历史指出，在我们党内一直存在着两条建党路线的斗争，一条是毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，一条是我党历史上一切机会主义者所推行的修正主义建党路线，中国赫鲁晓夫就是这条修正主义建党路线最集中的代表。这两条建党路线最根本的分歧，就是要不要以毛泽东思想作为党的指导思想的分歧。两条建党路线的斗争，始终是围绕着这个根本分歧展开的。在两条建党路线的斗争中，毛主席的亲密战友林副主席，一贯地站在伟大领袖毛主席一边，始终坚持以毛泽东思想作为党的指导思想，最忠诚、最坚决、最英勇地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，同党内一切“左”、右倾机会主义者，进行了针锋相对的、坚持不懈的斗争。他坚决捍卫毛主席的最高领袖地位，他号召全党要以毛主席为中心来团结，以毛泽东思想为中心来团结，他号召全党要团结在毛主席的周围，号召全党努力学习和掌握毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想作为全党一切工作的指导方针。林副主席对我们党的建设作出了卓越的贡献，为全党树立了光辉的典范。党内两条建党路线斗争的历史充分证明，坚持以毛泽东思想作为党的指导思想，就是坚持了毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，就能使我们党永远保持无产阶级先锋队的性质，领导无产阶级和革命群众把社会主义革命进行到底，把世界革命进行到底。反对以毛泽东思想作为党的指导思想，就必然会推行修正主义建党路线，使我党蜕化为修正主义的党、法西斯党。这是绝对不能允许的。因此，坚持还是反对以毛泽东思想作为党的指导思想，是关系到我们党的性质和方向的大问题，关系到中国革命和世界革命的前途和命运的大问题。代表们表示：毛主席永远是我们党的最高领袖，伟大的毛泽东思想永远是我们党的指导思想。谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，就是对中国革命的彻底背叛，就是对世界革命的彻底背叛，就是对共产主义事业的彻底背叛，我们就要全党共诛之，全国共讨之。
        毛主席制定的政治路线，为党
    的建设规定了唯一正确的方向
    代表们从我党胜利发展的历史中深刻体会到，毛主席在中国革命各个历史时期制定的马克思列宁主义的政治路线，为我们党的建设指明了唯一正确的方向。我们伟大领袖毛主席是当代最伟大的天才，他站得最高，看得最远，最善于在极端复杂和困难的情况下，提出最正确的政治路线，引导我们从胜利走向胜利。我们党的建设过程，正是同贯彻执行毛主席的政治路线密切联系着的。每当毛主席制定的政治路线得到顺利贯彻的时候，我们党就发展，就前进，就胜利；每当毛主席的政治路线遭到破坏的时候，我们党就缩小，就后退，就失败；即便只是受到干扰，也会给党的建设带来很大损失。我们党的建设过程，就是毛主席的马克思列宁主义的政治路线，不断战胜“左”、右倾机会主义路线而胜利发展的过程。我们党就是沿着毛主席的政治路线而发展、巩固起来的。
    在民主革命时期，毛主席在讲到党的政治路线同党的建设的关系时，曾经精辟地指出，党的建设过程，是同统一战线问题、武装斗争问题密切联系着的。
    毛主席说：“中国共产党的政治路线的重要一部分，就是同资产阶级联合又同它斗争的政治路线。中国共产党的党的建设的重要一部分，就是在同资产阶级联合又同它斗争的中间发展起来和锻炼出来的。”正是由于我们党在毛主席领导下，在同资产阶级结成统一战线的过程中，坚持了独立自主的原则，牢牢掌握了革命领导权；而当统一战线被迫破裂时，又同资产阶级进行了坚决的武装斗争，因而保证了我们党在思想上、政治上、组织上的巩固和发展壮大，取得了民主革命的彻底胜利。中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对和歪曲毛主席关于统一战线的正确政策，大搞阶级投降主义，公然要共产党放弃对统一战线的领导权。中国赫鲁晓夫这条投降主义的政治路线，就是要把我们党变成资产阶级的附庸。
    毛主席说：“我们的政治路线的重要一部分就是武装斗争。”“离开了武装斗争，离开了游击战争，就不能了解我们的政治路线，也就不能了解我们的党的建设。”正是由于我们党在毛主席领导下，经历了长期的武装斗争，打败了国内外凶恶的敌人，才建立和巩固了无产阶级专政的国家，使我们党锻炼成长为无比坚强的无产阶级革命党。中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对武装夺取政权的道路，特别是抗日战争胜利后，在中国两种命运、两个前途决战的前夕，他抛出了臭名昭著的“和平民主新阶段”，竟要我们党向国民党交出军队，放弃武装斗争，搞“议会斗争”。中国赫鲁晓夫这条修正主义的政治路线，就是要把我们党变成资产阶级的改良党。　　在社会主义革命时期，我党政治路线的根本问题，就是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。毛主席教导我们：在社会主义这个历史阶段中，必须坚持无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底，才能防止资本主义复辟，进行社会主义建设，为过渡到共产主义准备条件。离开了无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，离开了巩固无产阶级专政，就不可能了解社会主义时期党的建设。正是由于我们党坚决执行了毛主席的政治路线，才使我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业取得了辉煌的胜利，大大加强了我们党的革命化建设。中国赫鲁晓夫一贯宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，反对社会主义革命，反对无产阶级专政，妄图把中国拉回半殖民地半封建的老路。中国赫鲁晓夫这条反革命修正主义的政治路线，就是要把我们党变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党。
    代表们一致指出，几十年来，我们党的建设的经验说明，要把我们党建设成为真正的无产阶级革命党，最最重要的是贯彻毛主席为我们党制定的政治路线。毛主席的政治路线，是无产阶级的不断革命、彻底革命的路线，它反映了无产阶级的根本利益，是无产阶级意志的集中体现。因此，确立毛主席的政治路线在党内的统治地位，对于我们党始终保持无产阶级先锋队的性质是头等重要的大事。大家一致表示，坚决贯彻和誓死捍卫毛主席的政治路线，是我们共产党员和革命战士最纯的党性，最高的准则。为了实现毛主席的政治路线，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，粉身碎骨，在所不辞。
        用毛泽东思想教育党员，是党
    的建设的首要任务
    代表们深刻体会到，要使我们党能够领导无产阶级和革命群众，沿着毛主席指引的方向，把社会主义革命进行到底，把世界共产主义运动胜利地推向前进，就必须遵照毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，用毛泽东思想教育党员，提高无产阶级先锋队的觉悟。这是党的建设的首要任务。
    代表们指出，毛泽东思想是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级世界观最科学、最完整、最集中的体现。坚持还是反对用毛泽东思想教育党员，是用无产阶级世界观还是用资产阶级世界观改造我们党的问题，是关系到我们党的思想建设的方向问题。用毛泽东思想教育党员，就是用毛泽东思想统一全党的思想，统一全党的行动。用毛泽东思想教育党员，就是以毛泽东思想为武器，克服党内各种非无产阶级思想，使党员牢固地树立无产阶级世界观，不断提高在无产阶级专政下继续革命的自觉性，成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、密切联系人民群众、富有革命朝气的无产阶级先进分子。用毛泽东思想教育党员，就是用毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，培养和造就革命事业的接班人。“这是关系我们党和国家命运的生死存亡的极其重大的问题。这是无产阶级革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了从思想上腐蚀、瓦解我们党，一贯反对用毛泽东思想教育党员。他公然禁止把毛主席著作当作教育党员的基本教材，反对以毛泽东思想作为党支部建设的根本，妄图把党支部变成吃喝玩乐的“俱乐部”。他大肆推销不要阶级斗争、不要革命、不要无产阶级专政的黑《修养》，狂热鼓吹封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的思想垃圾，拚命兜售资产阶级利己主义世界观，极力提倡扼杀革命造反精神的奴隶主义，妄图腐蚀党员的灵魂，瓦解党的组织，使我们党蜕化为修正主义党，成为他复辟资本主义的工具。代表们说，中国赫鲁晓夫越是疯狂地反对用毛泽东思想教育党员，我们就越是要千倍万倍地努力学习毛泽东思想，一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    代表们以自己的切身体会说明，在社会主义革命新阶段，用毛泽东思想教育党员，使党员树立无产阶级彻底革命的思想，对当前党的建设具有特殊重要的意义。社会主义革命，不仅要同一切私有制实行彻底的决裂，而且要同伴随私有制产生的一切旧传统观念实行彻底的决裂。革命越向前发展，无产阶级的
  “公”字和资产阶级的“私”字的冲突就越突出。每个党员只有在当前无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，认真地锻炼自己，自觉地破私立公，搞好思想革命化，才能深刻理解毛主席在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大理论，很好地带领群众，把社会主义革命进行到底。代表们表示，一定要响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，遵照林副主席“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象”的指示，大学大用“老五篇”，彻底清除中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”论，“吃小亏，占大便宜”等反动谬论的恶劣影响，增强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在灵魂深处爆发革命，大破
  “私”字，大立“公”字，树立一心为公、一生为公的共产主义世界观，让毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，统帅生命的每一秒钟。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团在苏联复辟资本主义的教训告诉我们，无产阶级的政党蜕化为资产阶级的政党，政权的性质也就必然由无产阶级专政蜕化为资产阶级专政。一切阶级敌人为了颠覆无产阶级专政，首先就要使无产阶级政党变质，使共产党员变质。只有用毛泽东思想武装全体党员的头脑，才能使我们党有效地防止和反对修正主义，永远保持无产阶级革命党的性质，才能提高党员识别和抵制修正主义的能力；就是出了修正主义，党员也会起来造他们的反，粉碎他们的复辟阴谋。
        以毛泽东思想为武器，开展党
    内斗争，整顿党的组织，是使党巩
    固、发展的重要保证
    代表们指出，社会上尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，不可避免地要反映到我们党内来。各种非无产阶级思想每日每时地侵袭着我们党的组织，极少数意志薄弱的党员，在剥削阶级思想的腐蚀下会蜕化变质，阶级敌人也会采用各种手段混进我们党的队伍，从内部来破坏我们党。因此，以毛泽东思想为武器，积极开展党内斗争，不断整顿党的组织，是使我们党保持思想上、政治上、组织上的纯洁性，不断巩固、发展的重要保证。
    伟大领袖毛主席极其深刻地分析了党内斗争的社会根源和思想根源，阐述了党内斗争对党的建设的重大意义。毛主席说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”党内两条路线的斗争，就是阶级斗争在党内最集中、最突出、最尖锐的反映。在党内两条路线斗争中，我们党根据毛主席的一贯教导，严格区分了两类不同性质的矛盾。对于混进党内的阶级敌人和坚持错误路线而又死不悔改的顽固分子，坚决同他们斗争到底，把他们清除出党。对于犯了错误的同志，甚至犯了严重错误的同志，只要他们不是坚持不改，屡教不改，都要团结教育他们，按照毛主席的教导，对他们采取“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方针，“惩前毖后，治病救人”。一方面对于错误思想进行严肃的斗争，另方面又充分地给犯错误的同志留有自己觉悟的机会，借以达到既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的。毛主席经常教导我们：
  “对于人的处理问题取慎重态度，既不含糊敷衍，又不损害同志，这是我们的党兴旺发达的标志之一。”正因为我们党坚持了毛主席规定的一整套党内斗争的正确方针和方法，才不断战胜了历次“左”、右倾机会主义路线，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的基础上加强了全党的团结，使党在思想上、政治上和组织上更加一致，更加巩固。
    代表们着重指出，毛主席关于整风运动的伟大理论，对马克思列宁主义的建党学说，是一个非常杰出的、创造性的贡献。我们党经过历次整风运动，极大地提高了全党的毛泽东思想水平，清算了“左”、右倾机会主义路线，克服了党内的错误思想，纯洁了党的队伍。伟大的整风运动，使我们党保持了彻底的革命精神和朝气蓬勃的战斗风格，保证了革命战争的彻底胜利，保证了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对毛主席关于党内斗争的理论和整顿党组织的正确方针。他鼓吹“党内和平”，取消党内斗争。他掩盖党内斗争的阶级实质，抹煞党内两条路线的斗争。他破坏党的整风运动，歪曲整风运动的正确方针。他在大念“和平经”的同时，对于坚持正确路线的同志实行“残酷斗争，无情打击”，在干部问题上推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。中国赫鲁晓夫所以要这样做，就是为了让资产阶级思想在党内自由泛滥，就是为了包庇混进党内的叛徒、特务和一小撮走资派，就是为了推行他的反革命修正主义路线，实现篡党的罪恶目的。
    代表们强调指出，毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下进行的一次伟大革命运动，也是一次伟大的群众性的整党运动。毛主席教导我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”党内一小撮走资派，是无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象。充分揭露他们，彻底批判他们，坚决打倒他们，是这次文化大革命所要解决的主要问题，也是整顿党组织的重要任务。在这次运动中，亿万群众起来造了党内一小撮走资派的反，把那些被他们篡夺了的权力，重新夺回到无产阶级手中，彻底摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，揭露了隐藏在我们党内的资产阶级代表人物和叛徒、特务。在运动中，广大党员受到了最大的锻炼、最深刻的教育，涌现出许多新的骨干力量，挽救了犯错误的干部。文化大革命培养了大批无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级先进分子，为发展和壮大党的队伍创造了前所未有的良好条件。这是毛主席无产阶级建党路线的伟大胜利。代表们兴奋地谈到，正当我们迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时候，毛主席发出了整顿党组织的最新指示，使我们受到了极大的鼓舞，极大的教育。我们一定要反复学习，深刻领会，迅速落实，坚决贯彻。我们要进一步批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，大学大立毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，胜利完成整顿党的组织、加强党的建设的战斗任务。一定要使我们党变得更加纯洁，更加坚强，更加巩固，更加朝气蓬勃，永远保持无产阶级革命党的鲜红颜色。

    “既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”代表们体会到，毛主席的这个伟大教导，是对国际共产主义运动经验的极其深刻的总结，无论过去、现在和将来，一个国家的革命能不能发展和胜利，都取决于有没有一个无产阶级革命党。
    现在，世界已经进入了帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代。世界上越来越多的革命人民，掌握和运用毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，向着日薄西山、气息奄奄的旧世界，展开了规模空前的伟大斗争。世界革命形势一片大好，越来越好。但是，以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义，适应帝国主义和各国反动派的需要，把许多国家的无产阶级政党蜕变成了修正主义党、资产阶级尾巴的党。因此，摆在我们马克思列宁主义者面前最重要、最迫切的光荣战斗任务，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判现代修正主义，为建设真正的无产阶级革命党而斗争。
    代表们坚信：只要按照毛泽东思想的革命理论和革命风格加强党的建设，就一定能够使我们的党，永远成为领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织，一定能够领导无产阶级和革命人民打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。战无不胜的、光芒万丈的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，必将永远在全世界高高飘扬，胜利飘扬！　　      　　（新华社）
