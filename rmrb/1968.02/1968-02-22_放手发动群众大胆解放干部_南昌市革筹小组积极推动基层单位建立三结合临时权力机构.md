In the great march towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Nanchang Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group has extensively mobilized the masses, earnestly implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, and carried out the work of liberating cadres and establishing grassroots three-in-one temporary power organs in a bold and decisive manner. In a short period, a large number of leading cadres, with the enthusiastic help of the revolutionary masses, have come forward to participate in various tasks. Over eighty units have established revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs. The entire city is filled with a lively revolutionary atmosphere, where the relationship between cadres and the masses is further strengthened.

In implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, Nanchang Municipality has focused on the following aspects:

1. **Boldly Mobilize the Masses and Unify Their Actions with Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions.** Recently, the Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the provincial "Revolutionary Mass Organizations Coordination Committee" jointly held several large-scale mobilization and oath-taking meetings to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the same time, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "Holding study classes is a good way, and many problems can be solved in study classes," the municipality has established over 4,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 230,000 people participating. Through these study classes, the understanding of cadres, the masses, and the leaders of mass organizations on cadre issues has been rectified, and Chairman Mao's instructions on cadre issues have been earnestly implemented.

2. **Leadership Cadres Go Where the Problems Are to Conduct Thorough Political Work.** Wherever there are problems, leading cadres go there to conduct thorough and detailed political work. Wherever cadre issues have not been resolved, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are held to help the revolutionary masses and cadres raise their awareness and help more erring leading cadres come forward to participate in the revolution. Originally, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee were slow in liberating cadres, and the cadres who should have been liberated were not liberated in time. The Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group organized the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations at the level of brigade commanders and above from the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal People's Committee, and other units to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The two main leaders of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group personally presided over these classes, focusing on studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions on cadre issues. This helped the leaders of mass organizations resolve some of their vague understandings on cadre issues, unifying everyone's thoughts on the basis of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Subsequently, through their work, a large number of leading cadres quickly came forward to participate in the revolution.

3. **Set Examples and Promote from the Top.** The Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group selected typical cadres from various categories for a comprehensive survey, determined policy boundaries, set examples, and provided comparisons for the masses to understand clearly. For some cadres who should have been liberated but were not immediately accepted by the masses, the approach of having higher-level authorities explain the situation and then having the masses conduct further discussions and unify their understanding was adopted, effectively solving some long-standing cadre issues.

4. **Prevent Class Enemies from Inciting Discord and Prevent Bad Elements from Infiltrating the Revolutionary Ranks.** The Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group not only emphasized mobilizing the masses to enthusiastically help cadres come forward to participate in the revolution but also emphasized raising the masses' class struggle awareness. This was to prevent class enemies from using factionalism to fish in troubled waters and infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to carry out sabotage.

    放手发动群众大胆解放干部
    南昌市革筹小组积极推动基层单位建立三结合临时权力机构
    据新华社南昌二十日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大进军中，南昌市革命委员会筹备小组广泛发动群众，认真落实伟大领袖毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，大刀阔斧、雷厉风行地开展解放干部、建立基层三结合临时权力机构的工作。在很短时期内，大批领导干部在广大革命群众的热情帮助下，站出来参加了各项工作，八十多个单位建立起了革命三结合的临时权力机构。全市到处呈现干群关系进一步密切、一派生气勃勃的革命景象。
    南昌市在贯彻毛主席关于干部问题最新指示的工作中，主要抓了以下几个环节。
    一、大胆放手发动群众，用毛主席的最新指示统一广大革命群众的行动。最近以来，市革命委员会筹备小组和省“大联筹”等革命群众组织联合召开了几次规模很大的全面落实毛主席最新指示的动员大会和誓师大会。同时，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，在全市开办了四千多个各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的人数达二十三万多人。通过学习班端正干部、群众和群众组织负责人在干部问题上的各种认识，认真落实毛主席关于干部问题的指示。
    二、哪里有问题，领导干部就到哪里去，做深入细致的思想政治工作。哪里的干部问题还没有解决好，就在哪里办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助广大革命群众和干部提高认识，帮助更多犯错误的领导干部站出来革命。原来，市委、市人委解放干部的工作进展较慢，该解放的干部没有及时解放出来。市革筹小组就组织市委、市人委等单位的战斗队长以上的革命群众组织负责人举办毛泽东思想学习班，由市革筹小组的两位主要负责人亲自主持，着重学习和落实毛主席关于干部问题的一系列最新指示，帮助群众组织负责人解决在干部问题上的一些模糊认识，使大家的思想统一在毛主席最新指示的基础上。然后，通过他们做工作，结果使一大批领导干部很快地站出来革命。
    三、树立标竿，上帮下促。市革筹小组选择了各类的典型干部进行摸底排队，确定政策界限，树立标竿，使群众有所比较，做到心中有数。对于一些应该解放而群众一时通不过的干部，采取由上级出面讲清情况，然后由群众再次深入讨论、统一认识的办法，有效地解决了干部问题上一些老大难问题。
    四、解放干部时，要严防阶级敌人挑拨离间，防止坏人混入革命队伍内部。市革筹小组既重视发动群众热情地帮助干部站出来革命，也发动群众提高阶级斗争观念，严防阶级敌人利用派性，混水摸鱼，钻进革命队伍内部进行破坏。
