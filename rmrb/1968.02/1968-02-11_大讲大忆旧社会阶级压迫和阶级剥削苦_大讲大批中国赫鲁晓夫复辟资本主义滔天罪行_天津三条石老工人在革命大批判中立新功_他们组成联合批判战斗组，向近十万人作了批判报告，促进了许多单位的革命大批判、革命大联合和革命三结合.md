Old workers from Tianjin's Sanjiaoshi area have made new contributions in the revolutionary criticism movement. They have formed a joint criticism and struggle group and given criticism reports to nearly 100,000 people, promoting revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combinations in many units.

Editor's Note: Old workers from Tianjin's Sanjiaoshi industrial area have formed a joint criticism and struggle group. They have gone to factories, rural areas, schools, government agencies, and the military to speak out about their personal histories of suffering and their experiences in eliminating factionalism. They have spoken out and remembered the sufferings of class oppression and exploitation in the old society, and criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism. They have helped many revolutionary masses raise their socialist consciousness and promoted revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combinations in many units.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese proletariat has suffered three kinds of oppression (imperialist oppression, bourgeois oppression, and feudal oppression), and the severity and cruelty of these oppressions are rarely seen in the history of other nations; therefore, they are more resolute and thorough in their revolutionary struggles than any other class." The old workers of Tianjin's Sanjiaoshi are just like this. They suffered the most in the old society and are the most resolute in their revolution. They have the right to speak out about the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism. After they have learned and applied Chairman Mao's works and grasped Mao Zedong Thought as the most sharp weapon, they will, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm and fearless heroism, use irrefutable facts to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev thoroughly.

The old workers of Tianjin's Sanjiaoshi, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "not relying on past merits but making new contributions," have worked tirelessly and traveled far and wide to give reports on remembering sufferings and criticism. They have made important contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Their boundless loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao and their noble revolutionary qualities are worth learning from.

News from our newspaper: In the famous heavy industrial cradle of North China—Tianjin's Sanjiaoshi—an army of old workers who have deep hatred and bitterness has been organized. Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Sanjiaoshi, they have formed the "Tianjin Sanjiaoshi Old Workers Joint Criticism and Struggle Group." They have hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, through recounting their personal histories of suffering in the old society and their experiences in generating and eliminating factionalism during the Cultural Revolution, have severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism and implement the bourgeois reactionary line. From last October to now, they have given criticism reports in more than 80 factories, schools, military units, government agencies, and rural areas to nearly 100,000 people. The broad revolutionary masses, after hearing their bitter and tearful testimonies, have increased their hatred for the class enemies and expressed their determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overthrow factionalism, strengthen Party spirit, quickly achieve revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units.

The old workers of Tianjin's Sanjiaoshi are witnesses to the evil history of capitalism in old China

The Tianjin Sanjiaoshi Old Workers Joint Criticism and Struggle Group was established in late September last year with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Sanjiaoshi and based on the criticism movement. It has grown from the original dozen or so people to a powerful army of more than 80 people. The old workers who joined the criticism group are mostly those who, by luck, did not die in the old society and became apprentices. They all bear the marks of the bitter lives of the working class in the old society—scars.

In the old society, Tianjin's Sanjiaoshi was a living hell for workers. This famous street in Tianjin, near the confluence of the North and South canals, was lined with small workshops for casting iron and machinery manufacturing. In these iron foundries and machine shops, tens of thousands of apprentice workers, once they entered the factory, signed a "contract of indenture" and suffered the torture of the evil capitalists. Every day, they worked day and night, often for 18 to 19 hours, doing heavy labor that exceeded their physical strength several times over. They ate stale buns and rotten pickled vegetables, lived in dark, dirty, and dangerous dormitories and attics, covered themselves with rags and rotten quilts, and slept on broken straw mats. In the cold of winter, they wore rags and rotten quilts patched together with iron wire. At night, they had to stand guard for the capitalists in the ice and snow. These children, only 12 or 13 years old, had their waists bent from the heavy labor. Excessive fatigue made them fall asleep even while working or walking. Some fell asleep by the sand box. But this was a reason to be beaten, and iron rods, whips, and axe handles would fly at them. Those who were beaten to death were thrown into the North Canal; those who died from illness were buried in pits; those who were seriously ill were sent back home, and some died on the way. But the capitalists expanded their factories and businesses and made big profits. This is the most brutal part of the bloody history of the Chinese working class's oppression and exploitation, and it is a powerful critique of the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism!

The Tianjin Sanjiaoshi Old Workers Joint Criticism and Struggle Group went through many twists and turns in its establishment. At first, some people thought: We old workers, doing big criticism, writing articles, I'm afraid we can't do it, because our average cultural level is only elementary school second or third grade, how can we write? Faced with these problems, should we do it or not? If we say we won't do it, the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchman Zhou Yang have been spreading the capitalist's "exploitation is beneficial" black talk in Sanjiaoshi, which has already made the old workers so angry that they are bursting with words to say. In the end, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions, and Chairman Mao's words struck a chord in the hearts of the old workers. They said with full confidence: Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We establish the criticism group to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, which is paying attention to state affairs! Low culture, what of it? "Shake the hammer in your hand and speak the truth in your heart," the working class has one heart and follows Chairman Mao, whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it! After remembering bitterness and sweetness, the old workers angrily said: We old workers are witnesses to history, we speak with the most power, we have the right to speak! If we don't do it, do we let those stinking reactionary literati do it! Don't forget, we are the Chinese working class, we are the old workers of Sanjiaoshi, we have a score to settle with the Chinese Khrushchev in our hearts!

Overthrowing factionalism, uniting against the enemy

At the beginning, this group had only a dozen or so people. Because these old workers' views were consistent, as they put it: "We are old workers of the revolutionary rebel faction in Sanjiaoshi." The "joint" in the Joint Criticism and Struggle Group refers to the old workers of the "rebel faction" from various factories. In this way, more old workers were excluded from this organization.

In the early criticism meetings, they also felt that the atmosphere was not intense and the momentum was not great. But when they thought of those old comrades who had not joined the organization, their hearts were filled with anger. They thought: Class struggle is really complicated. Some of those who had suffered and grown up with them in the past had now "forgotten the past and changed." "They have even opposed our 'views.' This is not a class struggle issue? How can we develop them to participate in the criticism? No, 'better to have fewer but better,' we'll leave them out, we'll fight for the honor of the working class."

In September 1967, Chairman Mao inspected the south of the Yangtze River and issued a series of latest instructions. The good news inspired and encouraged this organization greatly. The old workers' criticism group immediately held a meeting. At the meeting, everyone, following Chairman Mao's teachings, deeply criticized their own incorrect views. They asked themselves: Do I have fundamental conflicts of interest with those class brothers who entered the factory and apprenticed with me? No, there are none! Then why did they join other organizations, and we treated them as "enemies"? Why can't we criticize our common enemy—the Chinese Khrushchev—together? The old workers discussed one after another. In the end, they unanimously recognized: The class enemy uses some trivial issues in our revolutionary mass organizations to stir up trouble and incite from both sides, trying to create chaos within us. At the same time, they use factionalism, this poisonous snake, to entangle us, making us unable to distinguish between enemies and ourselves. We must be vigilant and not fall into the class enemy's trap!

After recognizing this problem, they went to the door of those who had different views from them to have heart-to-heart talks, asking them to join hands and fight against the Chinese Khrushchev together.

In Sanjiaoshi, there are countless class brothers who have shared life and death in the old society. The old workers Li Yunchuan and Zhang Congxian of Sanjiaoshi Flour Machinery Factory are like this, and the old workers Li Tongpu and Chen Chunyang of Sanjiaoshi Machine Tool Accessories Factory are also like this. At the beginning, Chen Chunyang was excluded from the Joint Criticism and Struggle Group because of "different views." These two old workers both entered the then Fuzhixing Iron Factory in 1946. The 15-year-old Li Tongpu and the 12-year-old Chen Chunyang signed the "contract of indenture" together after entering the factory, and also signed the paper that said, "Apprenticeship for four years and five months without pay; if injured by flying hammers or drills, do not blame the factory, if you jump into the river or well, it is none of the factory's business." Later, when they were apprentices, they worked together, slept together in a broken quilt at night, and sometimes stood guard together. The thin Chen Chunyang could not bear such heavy torture, and the slightly taller Li Tongpu secretly helped him pull the bellows. Once, Li Tongpu was beaten by the capitalist to the point of mental collapse, and Chen Chunyang cried around Li Tongpu, sending him water and food, and cleaning up his excrement. In 1949, when Chairman Mao led the People's Liberation Army to liberate Tianjin, this pair of class brothers stood up, and they worked, studied, and built socialism together. But in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the Chinese Khrushchev's implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line, these two people had differences in their views and joined two different fighting organizations, attacking each other. Originally, these two people had deep hatred for the old society and the Chinese Khrushchev, but because they became "two factions," they were unwilling to participate in the criticism meeting together. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, Li Tongpu studied them over and over again, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest..." He thought: What fundamental conflicts of interest do I have with Springyang? None! Thinking and thinking, a feeling of love for his class brother surged in his heart, and he decided to go and talk to Chen Chunyang. In this way, the two class brothers became reconciled and participated in the old workers' Joint Criticism and Struggle Group together, directing their hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev.

The Tianjin Sanjiaoshi Old Workers Joint Criticism and Struggle Group has grown stronger. When someone asked about the foundation and fighting power of this criticism group, they would immediately say: We rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to establish our foundation; we rely on a red heart that loves Chairman Mao limitlessly to fight; we rely on our deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev to fight; we rely on our bitter experiences in the old society to fight! Now, this group has become a genuine and true Joint Criticism and Struggle Group.

The old workers regard every criticism report as a battle against the class enemy

At first, the old workers' content of remembering bitterness and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's crimes of attempting to restore capitalism was fixed. Although this solved some problems, they found that different units, different ages, and different objects, if they continued to speak in the same way, would not achieve better fighting results. Faced with this problem, they opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Chairman Mao said: "The situation is constantly changing, to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must learn." Through practice, they deeply felt that if they did not use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze their deep hatred for the enemy and make it systematic, they would not be able to hit the enemy accurately and fiercely. Therefore, before going to each unit to give a report, they would repeatedly recite Chairman Mao's great teaching of "not relying on past merits but making new contributions" and, according to the object, determine the main content of the report.

The old workers, through continuous learning and practice, continuously raised their political awareness. They regarded every report as their political responsibility and a battle against the enemy. Therefore, as long as the units invited them to give a report, no matter how cold the weather was, how strong the wind was, or how far the road was, even if there was no car, they would walk there. Old worker Liu Shiyao walked to a school several dozen li away in the cold wind to give a report; 62-year-old old worker Wang Fuyuan, with a seventh-level wind blowing on his head, went to a farm machinery station 80 li away in the southern suburbs to give a lecture. Sometimes they only ate one meal a day, or they could not drink water, but when they saw that their report promoted the factories and schools to overcome factionalism and achieve revolutionary unity, their hearts were happier than anything else. They said: "As long as we can contribute more to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, what's a little cold and tired!"

Old worker Wang Fuyuan of the Tianjin Artificial Leather Factory is the one who gave the most lectures. Every time he went to a place, he angrily raised his two hands and denounced to everyone the capitalists' exploitation of the laboring people in the old society and the Chinese Khrushchev's crimes of attempting to restore capitalism. He said: I came to the Sanjiaoshi factory as an apprentice from the countryside at the age of 12 with a pair of healthy hands. The capitalist, in order to make money, bought a machine and locked me in a small dark room to work for him, not even allowing me to go out to urinate. In this way, tired and hungry, in a few years, my ten fingers were smashed by the machine, nine of them. Later, the capitalist had more machines and more apprentices, and he kicked me out of the factory, leaving me to think of death several times. The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, said that the capitalists' "exploitation is beneficial" and "the laboring people are painful without exploitation, and it is comfortable to be exploited a little." This is sheer nonsense.

The old workers of the Tianjin Sanjiaoshi Old Workers Joint Criticism and Struggle Group, wherever they gave reports, the revolutionary masses there increased their hatred for the class enemies and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, overcome factionalism, unite, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! After listening to the old workers' report, young workers Yan Guifen and Zhou Huizhong of the Tianjin Artificial Leather Factory said: "Factionalism is a poisonous snake that wraps around our bodies and makes the Chinese Khrushchev laugh! Once factionalism acts up, the revolution is harmed. Today, we have recognized the harm of factionalism and must unite. No matter how many conditions there are, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the first condition. No matter how many contradictions there are, we and the Chinese Khrushchev are the biggest enemy-people contradiction. We must not let go of this main enemy."

    大讲大忆旧社会阶级压迫和阶级剥削苦　大讲大批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义滔天罪行
    天津三条石老工人在革命大批判中立新功
    他们组成联合批判战斗组，向近十万人作了批判报告，促进了许多单位的革命大批判、革命大联合和革命三结合
    编者按：天津三条石工业区的老工人，组成了一个联合批判战斗组，到工厂、农村、学校、机关、部队等许多单位，用自己的血泪史和消除派性的亲身体会，大讲大忆旧社会阶级压迫和阶级剥削的苦，大讲大批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，帮助许多革命群众提高了社会主义觉悟，促进了许多单位革命的大批判、革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    毛主席教导我们：“中国无产阶级身受三种压迫（帝国主义的压迫、资产阶级的压迫、封建势力的压迫），而这些压迫的严重性和残酷性，是世界各民族中少见的；因此，他们在革命斗争中，比任何别的阶级来得坚决和彻底。”天津三条石的老工人正是这样。他们在旧社会受苦最深，革命也最坚决。批判中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋，他们最有发言权。当他们活学活用毛主席著作、掌握毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器以后，就会以最大的革命积极性和大无畏的英雄气概，用无可辩驳的事实，把中国赫鲁晓夫批得体无完肤。
    天津三条石老工人，遵照毛主席的“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，不怕苦，不怕累，到处作忆苦批判报告，对无产阶级文化大革命作出了重要的贡献。他们对党对毛主席的无限忠心和高贵的革命品质，值得我们学习。
    本报讯　在华北著名的重工业摇篮——天津三条石，一支由苦大仇深的老工人组织起来的战斗队伍——“天津三条石老工人联合批判战斗组”，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，通过忆诉自己在旧社会的血泪史，和在文化大革命中产生和消除派性的经验，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫阴谋复辟资本主义和推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行。从去年十月到现在，他们先后到八十多处工厂、学校、部队、机关和农村，给近十万人作了批判报告。广大革命群众听了他们的血泪控诉，增加了对阶级敌人的仇恨，表示一定要落实毛主席的最新指示，打倒派性，增强党性，迅速实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改。
    三条石老工人是旧中国资本主义罪恶的历史见证人
    天津三条石老工人联合批判战斗组，是在驻三条石人民解放军的帮助下，在大批判的基础上，于去年九月下旬成立的。现在已由原来十几人发展成为一支拥有八十多人的强大战斗队伍。参加批判组的老工人，大都是那些在旧社会侥幸未死的徒工，他们身上都带着旧社会工人阶级苦难生活的见证——伤疤。
    在旧社会，天津三条石是工人的一座活地狱。三条石这条靠近南北运河汇合处的天津著名大街，街道两旁布满着铸铁业、机械制造业的小作坊。在那一处处的生铁厂、一行行的机器作坊里，成千上万的学徒工，一进厂就写下了“卖身契”，遭受着万恶的资本家的折磨。每天，他们没明没夜地干着超过体力几倍的重活，一干就是十八、九个小时。吃的是馊窝头，臭咸菜，住的是阴暗、肮脏、危险的窝铺和吊楼，盖的是麻袋片和烂棉絮，铺的是破草席。三九寒天，他们穿的是用铁丝穿起来的一块块烂棉絮和破布片。深夜，他们还要在冰天雪地里替资本家打更。这些十二、三岁的孩子，有的小小年纪腰就给压弯了。过度的疲劳，使他们在干活的时候，甚至走路的时候，都在打瞌睡。有的在沙土箱边坐着就睡着了。但这又是一次挨打的因由，铁棍、藤条、斧把子，会劈头盖脸地飞来。打死的，扔进了北运河；病死的，刨坑埋掉；病重的，送回家，有的半路上就咽了气。可是资本家却一天天扩厂兴业，发了大财。这是旧中国工人受压迫受剥削最残酷的一部血泪史，是对中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的一部最有力的批判书！
    天津三条石老工人联合批判战斗组在成立过程中，是经过了一番波折的。开始，有些人认为：咱们这些老师傅，搞大批判，写文章怕不行，因为平均文化水平是小学二、三年级，怎么能写？面对这些问题，到底是干还是不干？说不干吧，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的爪牙周扬在三条石鼓吹资本家“剥削有功”的黑话，早就把老工人气得火冒三丈，人人憋了一肚子话要说。最后，他们学习了毛主席的指示，毛主席的话，句句说在老工人的心里。他们充满信心地说：毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们成立批判组，批判中国赫鲁晓夫，就是关心国家大事呀！文化低算什么？“手里摇摇把，心说实在话”，工人阶级一个心眼跟毛主席走，毛主席怎么说，咱就怎么做！经过忆苦思甜，老工人们愤怒地说：我们老工人是历史的见证人，我们说话最有力量，我们最有发言权！我们不干，难道还叫那些臭反动文人去干！别忘了，我们是中国工人阶级，是三条石的老工人，我们心中有一本向中国赫鲁晓夫算的账啊！
    打倒派性，共同对敌
    这个组开始成立的时候只有十几人。因为这些老工人的观点是一致的，用他们的话来说：“我们是三条石革命造反派的老工人”。联合批判战斗组的“联合”两字，是指各厂“造反派”的老工人而言。这样一按派来挑选，就有更多的老工人被排除在这个组织之外。
    在开始的几次批判会上，他们也感觉火药味不浓，声势不大。但一想到那些没参加组织的老伙伴，心里就有点气。他们认为，阶级斗争真复杂呀，一些过去同自己一起受苦、一起长大的老工人，现在他们“忘了过去，变质了。”“他们竟然和我们‘观点’对立了，这还不是阶级斗争问题？怎能发展他们参加批判呢？不行，‘宁缺勿滥’，把他们抛开，我们给工人阶级争口气”。
    一九六七年九月，毛主席视察大江南北发表了一系列的最新指示。喜讯传来，给了这个组织极大的教育和鼓舞。老工人批判组马上召开了座谈会。会上，大家按照毛主席的教导，狠挖了自己思想深处的不正确看法。他们反问自己：难道我和那些一同进厂，一起学徒的阶级弟兄有根本的利害冲突吗？不！根本没有！那为什么人家参加其他组织，我们就把人家当成“冤家”了呢？为什么连对我们共同敌人——中国赫鲁晓夫，都不能在一起批判呢？老师傅你一言我一语地讨论着。最后，他们一致认识到：阶级敌人利用我们革命群众组织中的一些枝节问题，煽风点火，左右挑逗，企图在我们内部制造混乱，同时又利用派性这条毒蛇，缠住我们，使我们敌我不分。我们可千万要提高革命警惕性，不要上了阶级敌人的当啊！
    认识到这个问题后，他们就走上门去找和自己观点不同的阶级弟兄谈心，要求他们一起握紧拳头，并肩对中国赫鲁晓夫战斗。
    在三条石，有着数不清的在旧社会同生死共患难的阶级弟兄。三条石面粉机械厂的老工人李云川和张从霜是这样，三条石机床附件厂老工人李同普和陈春阳也是这样。开始，陈春阳就是因“观点”不同，被排除在联合批判战斗组之外。这两位老工人，都是在一九四六年同时进的当时福聚兴铁厂。十五岁的李同普和十二岁的陈春阳入厂后一起订的“卖身契”，也一起在这张写着“学徒四年零五个月不给分文；干活中飞锤走钻，碰死勿怨，投河觅井，于厂无干”的纸上画了押。以后学徒时，他们一起干活，寒夜里在一个破被里睡，有时在一起打更。瘦小的陈春阳受不了这样沉重的折磨，比他稍高的李同普就偷偷帮他拉风箱。有一次，李同普被资本家打得精神失常后，陈春阳心疼得围着李同普哭，给他送水送饭，倒屎倒尿。一九四九年毛主席领导的人民解放军解放了天津，这一对阶级弟兄翻了身，他们在一起工作、学习，一起建设社会主义。可是，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行了资产阶级反动路线，使这两个人产生了观点上的分歧，参加了两个战斗组织，互相攻击。本来这两个人对旧社会，对中国赫鲁晓夫都有一肚子深仇大恨，但由于成了“两派”，就都不愿意一起参加批判会。毛主席最新指示发表后，李同普一遍遍地学习着，“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突……”他想：我和春阳之间又有什么根本的利害冲突呢？没有！想来想去，一股对阶级弟兄热爱的感情，涌上他的心头，他决定找陈春阳去谈话。就这样，两个阶级弟兄又和好如初，一起参加了老工人联合批判战斗组，共同把仇恨对准中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    三条石老工人联合批判战斗组发展壮大了。当有人问起这个批判组靠什么起家，靠什么作战时，他们马上就会说：我们靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想起家；靠对毛主席无限热爱的一颗红心作战；靠对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨作战；靠我们在旧社会的一肚子苦水作战！现在，这个组已经成为一个名副其实的，真正的联合批判战斗组。
    老工人把每一次批判报告看作是对阶级敌人的一次战斗
    开始，老师傅忆苦和批判中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪行的内容都是固定的。这样虽然解决一些问题，但是，他们发现，单位不同，年岁不同，对象不同，照一个样讲下去，就不能达到更好的战斗效果。面对这个问题，他们又打开《毛主席语录》。毛主席说：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”通过实践，他们深深体会到光靠自己的一肚子对敌人的深仇大恨，如果不用毛泽东思想去分析，并使它条理化，就会对敌人打不准，打不狠。因此，他们每次到各单位去作报告前，总是反复背诵毛主席“不要吃老本，要立新功”的伟大教导，并根据对象，确定要报告的主要内容。
    老师傅们通过不断学习，不断实践，政治觉悟不断提高，他们把每一次报告，看作是自己的政治职责，是对敌人的一次战斗。因此，只要各单位请他们作报告，不管天气多冷，风多大，路多远，没有车，他们走也要走去。老工人刘世耀冒着寒风，徒步走到离家十几里外的学校作报告；六十二岁的老工人王福元，头顶七级大风，到八十里外的南郊为农机站工人讲课。他们有时一天只吃一顿饭，或喝不上水，但是，当他们看到他们的报告，促进了工厂、学校克服派性实现革命大联合后，心里比什么都高兴，他们说：“只要能为无产阶级文化大革命多贡献力量，冷点累点怕什么！”
    天津制灯厂老工人王福元，是讲课次数最多的一个。每到一处，他都愤怒地举起自己的一双手，向大家控诉旧社会资本家剥削劳动人民和中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪行。他说：我从十几岁带着一双健全的手，从农村来到了三条石工厂学徒。资本家为了发财，买了一台机器，把我锁在一间小黑屋里给他干活，连小便都不准出来。这样，连累带困，不出几年，我的十个手指，被机器砸掉了九个。以后，资本家机器多了，徒工多了，把我一脚踢出了工厂，落得我几次想死。中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，胡说资本家“剥削有功”、“劳动人民不受剥削就痛苦得很，有人剥削一下倒舒服。”这真是混蛋透顶。
    三条石老工人联合批判战斗组的老师傅们，报告到哪里，哪里的革命群众就增加了对阶级敌人的仇恨，表示一定要听毛主席的话，克服派性，联合起来，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！天津人造革厂青年工人阎桂芬、邹怀中听了老工人的报告，说：“派性真是一条毒蛇，缠在我们身上，笑在中国赫鲁晓夫心里！派性一作怪，革命受损害。今天，我们认识到了派性的危害性，一定要联合起来，千条万条，落实毛主席最新指示是第一条。千矛盾，万矛盾，我们和中国赫鲁晓夫才是最大的敌我矛盾。我们决不能放过这个主要敌人。”
