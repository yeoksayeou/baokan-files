A photo exhibition held by the Sudan-China Friendship Association in Khartoum closed on the 24th.

This photo exhibition was warmly received by people from all walks of life in Sudan. Since its official opening on February 2nd, more than 5,000 people have visited it. Many viewers, after visiting the exhibition, enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and the great achievements of the Chinese people in all fields. They also wished Chairman Mao a long life.

Some viewers also wrote passionate words in the guest book. One friend wrote: "Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the path for the working people of all countries. Mao Zedong's revolutionary line guides the people in their struggle towards independence and development. Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary of our time, leading socialism to victory worldwide and imperialism to its downfall."

Another friend wrote: The historical role of the Chinese people in building socialism and fighting against imperialism led by the United States and the revisionist clique of the Soviet Union has won my admiration. China is a bastion of revolution, a country leading the working people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle. All revolutionary people, in their common struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism, should unite as one, hold high the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, defeat imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and build a new world that belongs to the people.

    苏丹人民踊跃参观我国图片展览
    中国是世界革命的堡垒
    祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！赞扬毛泽东思想和中国文化大革命
    新华社喀土穆二十七日电　由苏丹—中国友好协会在这里举办的中国图片展览已在二十四日闭幕。
    这个图片展览受到苏丹各界人士的欢迎，从二月二日正式展出以来，总共有五千多人参观。许多观众在参观后纷纷赞扬毛泽东思想、中国无产阶级文化大革命和中国人民在各方面取得的伟大成就，并且祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。
    一些观众还在留言簿上写下了热情洋溢的词句。一位朋友写道：“毛泽东思想给各国劳动人民照亮了道路。毛泽东的革命路线指导着斗争中的人民走向独立和发展。毛泽东是社会主义走向全世界胜利、帝国主义走向全面崩溃的当代世界上最伟大的革命者。”
    另一位朋友写道：中国人民建设社会主义、同以美国为首的帝国主义和苏修领导集团作斗争的历史性作用，赢得了我的敬佩。中国是革命的堡垒，是带领亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲劳动人民进行斗争的国家。一切革命人民在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和现代修正主义的共同斗争中，要团结一致，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大旗帜，打败帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，建设一个属于人民的新世界。
