The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade, Taicang County, Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are making spring ploughing production a roaring success and are striving for an even greater harvest this year and for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Guide Spring Ploughing Production

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles." Hongjing Brigade places political and ideological work in the first position, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide spring ploughing production. They realize that to do a good job in spring ploughing production, the most fundamental thing is to rely on Mao Zedong Thought; the most fundamental thing to grasp is the thought revolutionization of the people. Therefore, they have set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, bringing the various active thoughts in spring ploughing production to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promoting spring ploughing production.

Some cadres and masses in this brigade had two kinds of thoughts that hindered the smooth progress of spring ploughing at the beginning of the spring ploughing season. One was overconfidence due to last year's bumper harvest, wanting to rest during the Spring Festival, and having a slackening attitude. The other was a lack of confidence due to the poor seedling growth of summer crops, thinking that there was no hope for the first half of the year, and having a sense of difficulty. Through the establishment of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres realized that doing a good job in this year's spring ploughing production has great political significance. It is related to striving for a bumper harvest for the whole year, related to implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," related to achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and related to supporting the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. With the improvement of ideological understanding, everyone unanimously expressed: We must resolutely fight the first battle of spring ploughing production and strive for an even greater harvest this year to make Chairman Mao proud. Comrade Gu Atiao, an active learner and applier of Chairman Mao's works, said: "Last spring, the letter from the Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao to us poor and lower-middle peasants has been shining in our hearts. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must be pioneers in grasping the revolution and models in promoting production. We must fire the first shot of spring ploughing and vow to achieve a bumper harvest for the whole year to report good news to Chairman Mao."

On the basis of study, the whole brigade also summed up and evaluated last year's agricultural production, seriously formulated this year's agricultural production plan and measures. Once the ideology is rooted, action becomes powerful. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have launched a magnificent spring ploughing production campaign with the ambition to make new contributions to the revolution.

"Cadres, cadres, to do revolution, one must take the lead"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." The revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade have all gone to the front lines of spring ploughing. They set an example and lead the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to make a big splash in spring ploughing, determined to make new contributions in the struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Cadres, cadres, to do revolution, one must take the lead." The revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade not only said it but also did it. They took the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, took the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, broke private interests first, and acted first. When breaking ice and dredging mud, they took the lead in getting on the boat; when the cold wind was biting, they were the first to start work; when transporting fertilizer over long distances, they were again at the forefront. Wherever there were difficulties, there were the figures of revolutionary cadres. Comrade Zhang Bingxing, the team leader of the 10th production team, took the lead in everything. In the cold of the third lunar month, when water droplets froze, he took the lead in getting on the boat to break ice and dredge mud. The dredging pole was covered with ice as soon as it came out of the water, but he and the community members dredged with even more vigor.

The brigade and team cadres on the front lines of spring ploughing have a more down-to-earth leadership style. They fight side by side with the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, discover problems and solve them promptly, and quickly promote good experiences. Last year, the wheat was sown late, and some community members had a sense of difficulty for a while. Brigade leader Sun Xiaoguan remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, raise our courage." He went to various production teams to work with the poor and lower-middle peasants and jointly studied and solved problems. He heard the poor and lower-middle peasants say: "The wheat seedlings are poor, but as long as they are fertilized with ash at the bottom and covered with mud, they can be well-fed and warm, and they can still have a bumper harvest." He also saw the community members of the 10th production team, despite the cold, universally applied mud slurry fertilizer to the wheat fields, and was greatly inspired. He then held two on-site meetings in the 10th production team to promote the experience of this team. The broad masses of community members overcame the sense of difficulty, and the whole brigade quickly launched a high tide of applying mud slurry fertilizer to the wheat.

"Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture" is the Motivation for Doing a Good Job in Spring Ploughing

"Learning from Dazhai in agriculture" is the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao. The various production teams of Hongjing Brigade specially set up Dazhai learning evening classes. Brigade Party branch secretary Yang Mingsheng reported to the community members and cadres his experience of learning from Dazhai and introduced the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, relied on their own efforts, and struggled hard. Through learning, the broad masses further established the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. The 13th production team had less fertilizer last year, but they learned from the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, relied on their own efforts to raise duckweed, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of rice, making it the team with the largest increase in production in the whole brigade. This year, they are even more enthusiastic, and the area of spring fertilizer applied to wheat is 19 times more than the same period last year. The people of Hongjing Brigade praise learning from Dazhai, saying: "Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, every team and person learns from Dazhai, relies on their own efforts for the revolution, and the red flowers of Dazhai bloom everywhere."

Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongjing Brigade are united as one, striving for even greater victories in spring ploughing production.

    洪泾大队革命干部战斗在春耕生产第一线
    广大贫下中农和革命干部，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，促进了思想革命化，春季生产搞得热火朝天
    本报讯　江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，把春耕生产搞得热火朝天，为争取今年农业更大丰收、夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。
    用毛泽东思想统帅春耕生产
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”洪泾大队把政治思想工作放在第一位，用毛泽东思想统帅春耕生产。他们认识到，搞好春耕生产，千靠万靠，最根本的要靠毛泽东思想；千抓万抓，最根本的要抓人的思想革命化。因此，他们办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，带着春耕生产中的各种活思想，活学活用毛主席著作，推动春耕生产。
    这个大队的部分干部和群众，在春耕开始前，有两种思想情绪障碍着春耕生产的顺利开展。一种是因为去年大丰收而盲目乐观，想在春节中歇口气，存在松劲思想。另一种是因为夏熟作物的苗势差而缺乏信心，认为上半年没希望了，存在畏难情绪。通过举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，广大贫下中农和革命干部认识到，搞好今年春耕生产具有重大的政治意义，它关系到争取全年农业的大丰收，关系到落实毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，关系到支援越南人民和世界革命人民的革命斗争。思想认识提高了，大家一致表示：坚决打好春耕生产第一仗，夺取今年农业更大丰收，为毛主席争气。活学活用毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃说：“去年春天，党中央、毛主席写给我们贫下中农的信，一直金光闪闪地照亮着我们的心。我们一定要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做抓革命的闯将，当促生产的模范。我们一定要打响春耕第一炮，誓夺全年大丰收，向毛主席报喜。”
    在学习的基础上，全大队还通过对去年农业生产的总结、评比，认真制定了今年农业生产的计划和措施。思想一扎根，行动就有力。广大贫下中农和革命干部怀着为革命立新功的雄心壮志，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，掀起了轰轰烈烈的春耕生产高潮。
    “干部干部，干革命要先走一步”
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”洪泾大队的革命干部，纷纷走上春耕第一线。他们以身作则，带领广大贫下中农大闹春耕，决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中立新功。
    “干部干部，干革命要先走一步。”洪泾大队的革命干部这样说了，也这样做了。他们带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头落实毛主席的最新指示，破私破在前，行动走在前。破冰罱泥，他们带头下船；寒风刺骨，他们第一个出工；远途运肥，他们又跑在最前面。哪里有困难，哪里就有革命干部的身影。第十生产队队长张炳兴，事事跑在前，迎着困难上。三九寒天，滴水成冰，他带头下船敲冰罱泥。罱杆一出水就结上了冰，他和社员却越罱越有劲。
    在春耕第一线的大队、生产队干部，领导作风比过去更加深入。他们和贫下中农共同战斗，学习贫下中农，依靠贫下中农，发现问题及时解决，发现好经验迅速推广。去年三麦播种较晚，部分群众一度产生畏难情绪。大队长孙小观牢记毛主席“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的教导，到各生产队和贫下中农一起劳动，共同研究和解决问题。他听到贫下中农说：“麦苗差，只要灰打底，泥盖被，让它吃饱盖暖，照样能丰收。”又看到第十生产队社员不怕天寒地冻，给麦田普遍浇上了泥浆肥，受到很大启发。他便两次在第十生产队召开现场会，推广这个队的经验。广大社员克服了畏难情绪，全大队迅速掀起了给三麦浇泥浆肥的高潮。
    “农业学大寨”是搞好春耕的动力
    “农业学大寨”，这是伟大领袖毛主席发出的伟大号召，洪泾大队各生产队专门办了学大寨业余学习班。大队党支部书记杨明生向社员、干部汇报了去大寨学习的体会，介绍了大寨人高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的革命精神。经过学习，广大群众进一步树立了自力更生的革命精神。第十三生产队去年化肥少，他们学习大寨革命精神，自力更生养绿萍，水稻获得空前大丰收，是全大队增产幅度最大的一个队。今年他们劲头更大，三麦春肥施的面积比去年同期增加十九倍。洪泾大队群众歌颂学大寨说：“毛泽东思想放光彩，队队人人学大寨，自力更生为革命，大寨红花遍地开。”
    现在，洪泾大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部，团结一心，正在为夺取春耕生产的更大胜利而奋斗。
