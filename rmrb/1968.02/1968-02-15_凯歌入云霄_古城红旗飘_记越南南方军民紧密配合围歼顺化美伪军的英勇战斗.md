In the wake of the new year's stunning victories by the people of South Vietnam, the heroic people of Hue have achieved extraordinary feats. At dawn on January 31, the People's Liberation Armed Forces, in close coordination with the people of Hue, launched an irresistible offensive against the enemy in the city. They demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism, sweeping through the enemy's strongholds, striking down American aggressors, capturing traitorous Vietnamese, and overthrowing the rule of the puppet regime. To this day, the glorious flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam proudly flies over the fortress of this heroic city.

According to a supplementary report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, on January 30, the People's Liberation Armed Forces divided into multiple units and swiftly advanced towards Hue. With deep hatred for the enemy, they were filled with fighting spirit, determined to drown the enemy in the surging waves of people's war.

The ancient city of Hue is the enemy's headquarters, divided into four districts: Phu Cam, Phu Nuan, Thanh Khe, and Tay Loc. Surrounding this major enemy stronghold are two layers of city walls, numerous outposts, sentry posts, and watchtowers, forming what the enemy calls a "fortified defense system."

At 2:30 AM on January 31, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched an attack on the Phu Cam district. Shells accurately struck the enemy's base. Soldier A Mai, leading a squad, along with the local self-defense forces, attacked the West Gate. The demolition team quickly blew up the layers of barbed wire in front of the gate. Another soldier, A Hung, leading a platoon, immediately rushed forward and planted the victorious flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on the West Gate of the ancient city. The assault troops, along with tens of thousands of people from Hue, surged into the ancient city like a tide.

At the North Gate, A Hien's squad, soon after the battle began, captured several enemy bunkers, cutting off Phu Cam district from other districts and directly assaulting the command post of the puppet army's 1st Division.

In the south of the city, soldiers advanced along the city walls, crossing the Perfume River, and fiercely attacked the southeast of Phu Cam district.

At this time, another unit of the People's Liberation Armed Forces attacked the enemy's parking lot in Phu Cam district. In just fifteen minutes of fighting, the People's Liberation Armed Forces annihilated the enemy on the outskirts of Phu Cam district, directly assaulting the center of Phu Cam district, scattering the enemy into small groups, and then annihilating them one by one. Under the command of Political Instructor Nguyen Xuan Cam, the soldiers attacked the quarters of the puppet military officers and the enemy's "psychological warfare personnel." The enemy, caught off guard by this lightning strike, was struck down in large numbers. Some stubborn elements tried to escape to the command center to hide in the fortifications and resist. But the soldiers pursued and annihilated these enemies completely.

In the parking lot of Phu Cam district, while fiercely attacking the enemy, the soldiers destroyed many enemy vehicles. The entire parking lot was soon engulfed in flames and thick smoke.

When the West Gate was blown up by the People's Liberation Armed Forces, the forces at the East Gate also annihilated the enemy guards and captured several bunkers. Platoon Leader A Nam led part of the troops along the Perfume River, like a sharp blade, cutting Phu Bai Airport into two parts, and then fiercely attacking the enemy in the military supply depot area. A De led a squad into the east gate of the airport, driving the enemy into the airport center and annihilating them all. Then, the soldiers crossed the Perfume River and advanced, coordinating with brother units to annihilate the enemy in the military supply depot area. Meanwhile, A Quan also led a squad into Phu Bai Airport, surrounding and annihilating the enemy, and destroying dozens of planes. Under the fierce attacks of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, the remaining enemy fled across the Perfume River, escaping towards the military supply depot area. The entire Phu Bai Airport became a sea of fire.

At this time, all the city gates had been breached. The People's Liberation Armed Forces divided into three columns, sweeping through the ancient city of Hue, attacking the enemy's headquarters, and quickly occupying the enemy's administrative area. Many high-ranking officials of the puppet government of Hue were captured or surrendered.

While fiercely attacking Phu Cam and Phu Bai districts, the People's Liberation Armed Forces also divided into columns to annihilate the enemy at the Noon Gate, the Gate of Benevolence, and the Gate of Prosperity, capturing these gates and surrounding the enemy in the inner city. They also fiercely attacked and annihilated a reconnaissance company of the enemy's Dong Ha Camp. The remaining enemy fled in all directions, some even hiding in sewers, but were dragged out by the people and self-defense forces.

At 10:00 AM on January 31, the People's Liberation Armed Forces captured the enemy's "Citadel" in Hue, and amidst the earth-shaking cheers, the invincible flag of the National Liberation Front was raised high.

The flag of the National Liberation Front, in this historic spring, fluttered in the wind over Hue, further inspiring the people and soldiers of Hue to advance and achieve even greater victories.

    凯歌入云霄  古城红旗飘
    记越南南方军民紧密配合围歼顺化美伪军的英勇战斗
    在越南南方军民取得震撼世界的新春大捷中，英雄的顺化市军民立下了极其辉煌的战功。一月三十一日凌晨，人民解放武装力量在顺化市人民的紧密配合下，浩浩荡荡地向这个城市的敌人发起锐不可挡的攻势。他们发扬高度的革命英雄主义精神，在敌巢里纵横驰骋，痛打美国强盗，追捕越奸恶棍，推翻了卖国走狗的统治。至今，越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜仍骄傲地飘扬在这个英雄城市的城堡上。
    据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，一月三十日，人民解放武装力量分成多路，神速地朝着顺化市挺进。他们怀着对敌人的无比仇恨，一个个斗志昂扬，决心把敌人淹没在气壮山河的人民战争海洋里。
    古城顺化市是敌人的首脑机关所在地，分芒嘎、西禄、大内和东波四个区。在敌人的这个大巢穴周围，有两道城墙，还有许多据点、哨所和岗楼，形成了敌人的所谓坚固的防御系统。
    一月三十一日凌晨二时三十分，人民解放武装力量对芒嘎区发动进攻，炮弹准确地落在敌人的驻地。人民解放武装力量战士阿麦率领的一个组，在顺化市内的自卫队的配合下，向西门进攻。爆破手很快地炸毁了城门前的层层铁丝网。另一个战士阿雄率领的一个班立刻冲上前去，把越南南方民族解放阵线胜利的旗帜插在古城的西门上。突击队的战士们和成千上万的顺化市人民一起，象潮水般地涌进古城。
    在古城北门，阿献带领的一个组在战斗打响后不久，就攻克了敌人的几个碉堡，切断了芒嘎区与其他区的联系，直捣伪军第一师指挥所。
    在城南，战士们沿着城墙挺进，横跨二河，猛攻芒嘎区东南面。
    这时候，人民解放武装力量另一支部队向芒嘎区敌人的停车场发动进攻。仅经过十五分钟的战斗，人民解放武装力量就歼灭了芒嘎区外围的敌人，直捣芒嘎区中心，把敌人驱散成许多小块，然后逐个歼灭。在指导员阮春咸的指挥下，战士们进攻伪参谋军官宿舍区和敌人“心理战人员”宿舍区。敌人遭到这一闪电般的袭击，措手不及，被打得尸横遍地。一些顽固的家伙企图逃到指挥所中心区，以便躲在工事里顽抗。但战士们跟踪追击，彻底干净地歼灭了这些敌人。
    在芒嘎区停车场上，战士们在狠歼敌人的同时，击毁了敌人的许多军车。整个停车场上，顿时烈火熊熊，浓烟滚滚。
    当西门被人民解放武装力量爆破的时候，右门的人民解放武装力量也全歼了守门的敌人，攻克那里的几座碉堡。连长阿南带领一部分战士沿着二河岸，象一把锐利的尖刀，把西禄机场切成两部分，然后猛歼军用物资仓库区的敌人。阿德带领一个组突入机场东门，把敌人驱进机场中心，全部歼灭。接着，战士们又跨过二河向前挺进，配合兄弟部队消灭军用物资仓库区的敌人。与此同时，阿俊也率领一个组攻进西禄机场，把敌人包围起来痛歼，并且一举击毁了数以十计的飞机。在人民解放武装力量的猛烈打击下，残敌纷纷越过二河，向军用物资仓库区窜逃。整个西禄机场成了一片火海。
    这时候，各个城门都被突破。人民解放武装力量分成三路，在顺化古城里纵横驰骋，向敌人的首脑机构猛攻，迅速占领了敌人的行政机构区。顺化市伪政权的许多高级官员被活捉或投降。
    人民解放武装力量在猛攻芒嘎区和西禄区的时候，还分路消灭午门、显仁门和章德门的敌军，占领了这几道城门，把大内区的敌人团团围住，并且猛攻和全歼了延鸿兵营敌军的一个侦察连。残敌四处逃命，有的甚至钻进阴沟洞里，但也被人民和自卫队员揪了出来。
    三十一日上午十时，人民解放武装力量攻克了顺化市敌人的“族台”，在震撼大地的欢呼声中，民族解放阵线百战百胜的旗帜高高地升起。
    民族解放阵线的旗帜，在这个具有历史意义的春天，在顺化市上空迎风招展，更加鼓舞顺化市军民乘胜前进，夺取更加辉煌的胜利。
