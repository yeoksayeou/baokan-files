Recently, a Soviet revisionist clown named En. Inozemtsev has come out and repeated Khrushchev’s absurd claim that “any small ‘local war’ will become the spark that ignites a world war.” He loudly proclaims that peoples resisting invasion will “increase” the danger of a world war.

According to this clown, is the world war not caused by the invaded? According to this logic, was the Second World War not caused by the peoples of various countries resisting the invasions of German, Japanese, and Italian fascism? This logic of turning black into white is utterly absurd!

World wars are the product of imperialist policies of aggression and war. As the great Lenin pointed out: “War, at all times and in all places, is always instigated by the exploiting, ruling, and oppressing classes.” “Modern war is born of imperialism.” Countless ironclad facts have proven Lenin’s brilliant judgment.

Everyone knows that the First World War was a dog-eat-dog war caused by imperialist countries fighting over spoils. The Second World War was launched by German, Japanese, and Italian fascists to realize their wild ambitions of aggression. The same is true for world wars and local wars. The Korean War, the Vietnam War, and all the big and small wars currently existing in the world are all created and launched by imperialism, especially American imperialism and its running dogs.

According to the logic of the Soviet revisionist traitors, any spark will ignite a world war. If that were true, how many world wars should have occurred by now! However, historical facts are not like this. For the past twenty-some years since the war, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have never stopped their revolutionary wars against imperialism and its running dogs. Yet, has any of these wars developed into a world war? The facts are the opposite. Isn’t it precisely the just struggles of the peoples in these regions that have greatly tied down and weakened the war strength of American imperialism, disrupted the counter-revolutionary global strategy of American imperialism, and effectively prevented a world war? Those who talk big about maintaining world “peace,” the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, are aiding the tiger, pursuing a line of capitulationism, betraying and sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and thus greatly fanning the flames of American imperialist aggression.

The argument that the peoples resisting invasion will “increase” the danger of a world war, stripped of its disguise, is actually an argument against revolution, forbidding revolution. According to the logic of the Soviet revisionists, whoever suffers from imperialist invasion deserves their misfortune, and they should endure it, submit to being slaughtered, and remain slaves forever. Otherwise, they will “increase” the danger of a world war and will not be maintaining world peace. Isn’t this “allowing the officials to set fires while forbidding the common people to light lamps”?

The Soviet revisionist traitors’ argument is actually to make the oppressed nations and peoples “peacefully coexist” with imperialism and its running dogs, to endure their oppression and exploitation forever, not to resist, not to engage in revolutionary struggles, and certainly not to wage wars of national liberation and people’s revolutionary wars. In short, they are using the pretext of preventing a world war to carry out counter-revolutionary actions, attempting to help the imperialism, which is heading towards total collapse, maintain its reactionary rule and prolong its life.

The seas are roaring with waves, and the continents are shaking with thunder. Today, the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is shining over the entire world. The oppressed peoples and nations of the world are gradually realizing that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun barrel. Counter-revolutionary wars can only be eliminated with revolutionary wars. No matter what tricks modern revisionism plays, attempting to obstruct and strangle the national liberation movement and national liberation wars will never succeed. The revolutionary peoples of the world have already taken up their guns and are fighting. Imperialism and all its accomplices and running dogs will be buried in the grave. A bright red new world is about to be born!

    斥苏修叛徒反对革命战争的荒唐逻辑
    北京卫戍区某部　张家凯　毕世明
    最近，有一个名叫恩·伊诺泽姆采夫的苏修小丑跳将出来，重复赫鲁晓夫那句“任何一个小小的‘局部战争’都会成为引起世界大战火灾的星星之火”的谬论，大肆叫嚷：遭受侵略的人民反对侵略会“增加”世界大战危险。
    照这个小丑的说法，世界大战岂不是由被侵略者引起来的吗？照此推理，第二次世界大战岂不是由各国人民抵抗德、日、意法西斯的侵略而引起来的吗？这种颠倒黑白的逻辑，真是荒唐到了极点！
    世界大战是帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的产物。正如伟大的列宁曾经指出的：“战争无论何时何地总是由剥削者、统治者和压迫者阶级挑起的。”“现代战争产生于帝国主义。”无数铁的事实雄辩地证明了列宁的这个英明论断。
    人们知道，第一次世界大战是帝国主义国家群狗争食，争得不可开交而爆发的一次狗咬狗的战争。第二次世界大战是德、日、意法西斯为了实现其狂妄的侵略野心而发动的。世界大战如此，局部战争也是如此。朝鲜战争，越南战争，以及目前世界上存在的大大小小的战争，都是帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义及其走狗制造和发动起来的。
    按照苏修叛徒的说法，任何星星之火都会引起世界大战，那样，不知道该发生过多少次世界大战了！但是历史的事实并不是这样。战后二十几年来，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民进行的反对帝国主义及其走狗的革命战争从未停止过，可是有那一次发展成世界大战了呢？事实恰恰相反，难道不正是这些地区人民的正义斗争，大大地牵制和削弱了美帝国主义的战争力量，打乱了美帝国主义的反革命全球战略部署，有效地防止了世界大战吗？而那些大谈维护世界“和平”的苏修叛徒集团，为虎作伥，推行投降主义路线，出卖和破坏各国人民的革命斗争，才是大大地助长了美帝国主义的侵略气焰。
    所谓遭受侵略的人民反对侵略就会“增加”世界大战危险的论调，拆穿了说，就是反对革命，不许革命。按照苏修的逻辑，谁遭受帝国主义的侵略，谁就是活该倒霉，谁就得逆来顺受，听任宰割，永做奴隶，否则就会“增加”世界大战危险，就是不维护世界和平。这不是“只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯”吗？
    苏修叛徒的这种说法，实际上就是要被压迫民族和被压迫人民同帝国主义及其走狗“和平共处”，永世忍受它们的压迫和剥削，不要进行反抗，不要进行革命斗争，更不要进行民族解放战争和人民革命战争。总之，他们就是借防止世界大战之名，行反革命之实，妄图帮助走向全面崩溃的帝国主义维持它的反动统治，延长它的寿命。
    四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。今天世界已进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，光焰无际的毛泽东思想已普照全世界。全世界被压迫民族和人民逐渐懂得了：整个世界只有用枪杆子才能改造，反革命战争只有用革命战争来把它消灭。不管现代修正主义玩弄什么花招，企图阻挡和扼杀民族解放运动和民族解放战争是决不会得逞的。世界革命人民已经拿起枪杆子，起来战斗了。帝国主义及其一切帮凶、走狗都要被葬入坟墓。一个红彤彤的新世界就要诞生了！
