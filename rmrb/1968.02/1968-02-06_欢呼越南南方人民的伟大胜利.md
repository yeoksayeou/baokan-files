	Hail the Great Victory of the People of South Vietnam

	“Wind and rain bring spring’s return, flying snow welcomes spring’s arrival.”

	The heroic people of South Vietnam have achieved a great victory in the New Year offensive! It was a resounding success! The news has filled us with excitement, and we raise our hands high to cheer for the glorious victory of the people of South Vietnam. We extend our congratulations, respect, and learn from the heroic people of South Vietnam.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao said: “You have fought well! Under extremely difficult conditions, relying on your own strength, you have beaten the most ferocious imperialist aggressor, the United States, into a corner, making it panic-stricken and disoriented. This is a great victory.”

	The great victory of the people of South Vietnam in the New Year offensive marks a new height in the people of South Vietnam’s war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation. The day when the Vietnamese people will completely defeat American imperialism is not far off.

	The people of South Vietnam have firmly grasped the initiative in the great people’s war. They strike when they want, where they want, and how they want. They strike accurately and decisively. The New Year offensive is a vivid embodiment of this initiative.

	With the might of a surging tide, the people of South Vietnam launched a powerful offensive across the entire South Vietnamese battlefield, achieving surprise victories and striking directly at the strongholds of the American puppet regime in Saigon, Da Nang, Hue, Quang Tri, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, Pleiku, and more than fifty other enemy-occupied provincial capitals, towns, and military bases. Whether it is the American invaders’ “embassy” or the traitorous puppet’s “presidential palace,” whether it is military bases or ports and airports, the liberation forces of South Vietnam can launch surprise attacks, like gods from the heavens, defeating the American puppet forces and striking fear into their hearts. The American invaders and their lackeys are completely engulfed in the vast sea of people’s war, finding themselves in the pathetic situation of being passively beaten. Chairman Mao said: “To achieve initiative over the enemy, we can press down the enemy and defeat it, and the final victory will be ours.” The people of South Vietnam now have this initiative in war, so the final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation will inevitably belong to the Vietnamese people.

	The New Year offensive in South Vietnam has the characteristics of combining military and civilian efforts, urban and rural areas, and internal and external forces. The New Year offensive shows that the people of South Vietnam can not only wage a broad people’s war in the rural areas where the enemy’s control is weak but also push the battlefield of the people’s war into the enemy’s tightly controlled central cities. Combining urban and rural battles, blooming everywhere in the enemy’s heart, relentlessly pursuing and attacking, leaving the enemy with no place to hide. In this great victory, the people of South Vietnam opened a battlefield in the enemy’s stronghold of Saigon, causing chaos among the enemy forces and rendering them immobile. The liberation forces even temporarily occupied the American invaders’ “embassy.” The American invaders are surrounded on all sides, living in constant fear, and cannot even explain “what happened.” The people of South Vietnam have demonstrated the immense power of the people’s war.

	The New Year offensive fully demonstrates the tremendous power of the people of South Vietnam in their close unity, close cooperation, and joint struggle. The Vietnamese people have become one in the battle, with every person, every village, and every city becoming a battlefield, and every place becoming a burial ground for the American invaders. Even the chief of staff of the U.S. forces in Vietnam had to admit in fear: “This offensive was coordinated to an astonishing degree, fierce to an astonishing degree, and bold to an astonishing degree.” He helplessly lamented: “We have no more reserves.” The people of South Vietnam have been fully mobilized, forming a vast net.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao said: “The deepest source of the power of war lies in the masses.” “Mobilizing the entire population creates a vast sea that will drown the enemy.” Today, the American invaders in South Vietnam are like a wild ox trapped in the Vietnamese people’s fiery ambush, being burned to death by the raging flames.

	“Ten thousand trees in frost, red and brilliant, heavenly soldiers’ rage surges to the heavens.”

	The heroic people of Vietnam have already beaten the American invaders into a state of utter disarray. The situation on the Vietnamese battlefield is excellent, and the complete failure of American imperialism in Vietnam is not far off.

	However, the enemy will not die easily; they will surely make a desperate struggle before their end. Before dawn, the Vietnamese people will still have to go through a period of arduous struggle. Our great leader Chairman Mao said in a telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho: “Persistence is victory.” The heroic people of Vietnam are full of confidence in victory, brave and fearless, not afraid of sacrifice, persisting in a protracted war, and thoroughly defeating the American invaders.

	We, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly support the Vietnamese people’s struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and we are determined to be a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people, ready at any time to aid the Vietnamese people and, together with the Vietnamese people, defeat the American imperialist wolf.

	The people of South Vietnam will surely win!
	American imperialism will surely fail!

    欢呼越南南方人民的伟大胜利
    装甲兵机关无产阶级革命派
      “风雨送春归，飞雪迎春到。”
    英雄的越南南方军民新春大捷打得好！打得漂亮！喜讯传来，我们兴奋异常，高举我们的双手为越南南方军民的辉煌胜利而欢呼。我们向英雄的越南南方军民祝贺、致敬和学习。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“你们打得好！你们在非常艰苦的条件下，依靠自己的力量，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，这是一个伟大的胜利。”
    英雄的越南南方军民的新春大捷，标志着越南南方人民抗美救国战争已经发展到一个新的高度，越南人民彻底打败美帝国主义的日子已经不远了。
    越南南方人民已经在伟大的人民战争中，牢牢掌握了主动权。要什么时候打，就什么时候打；要在什么地方打，就在什么地方打；要打个什么样，就打个什么样；要打你，就打准你，吃掉你。越南南方军民新春大捷就是这种主动权的生动的体现。
    越南南方军民以排山倒海之势，在整个南越战场上发动了强大的攻势，出奇制胜，直捣美伪集团巢穴西贡、岘港、顺化、广治、归仁、芽庄、波来古等五十多个敌占省会、城镇和军事据点。不管是美国侵略者的“大使馆”，还是卖国傀儡的伪“总统府”；无论是军事基地，还是港口机场，越南南方人民解放武装力量都能够进行奇袭，有如天兵天将，把美伪军打得落花流水，魂飞魄丧。美国侵略者及其走狗完全陷在人民战争的汪洋大海之中，处于被动挨打的可悲境地。毛主席说：“实现我对于敌的主动权，就能压倒敌人而击破之，而最后胜利就属于我们了。”南越军民现在已经掌握了这种战争的主动权，因此，抗美救国战争的最后胜利也就必然地属于越南人民了。
    越南南方的新春大捷，具有军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合的特点。新春大捷表明，南越军民不仅可以在敌人统治薄弱的农村开展广泛的人民战争，而且可以把人民战争的战场推进到敌人严密控制的中心城市。把城乡的战斗结合在一起，在敌人的心脏里四面开花，穷追猛打，使敌人无处躲藏。这次大捷中，南越军民在美伪集团的巢穴西贡开辟战场，把这个城市的敌人打得一片混乱，动弹不得。人民武装力量还曾一度占领美国侵略者的“大使馆”。美国侵略者四面楚歌，朝不保夕，连“发生了什么事”也都“无法说明了”。越南南方军民发挥了人民战争的无比威力。
    新春大捷，充分显示了越南南方军民紧密团结，紧密结合，共同战斗的巨大力量。越南军民在战斗中结成了一个整体，人自为战，村自为战，城自为战，无处不是战场，无处不是美国侵略者的葬身之地。就连侵越美军的作战主任也不得不惶恐地承认：“这次攻势协调配合好到了惊人的程度，猛烈得惊人，大胆得惊人。”他无可奈何地哀叹：“我们没有剩余的力量了。”越南南方人民已经完全动员起来，组成了天罗地网。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海”。今天，美国侵略者在南越已经是一头落在越南人民火阵中的野牛，正在被熊熊烈火所烧死。
      “万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。”
    英雄的越南人民已经把美国侵略者打得狼狈万状。越南战场形势一片大好，美帝国主义在越南的彻底失败已经为期不远了。
    但是，敌人是不甘心死亡的，他们必然要作垂死的挣扎。在黎明之前，越南人民还会经历一段艰苦斗争的路程。我们伟大领袖毛主席在给阮友寿主席的电报中说：“坚持下去就是胜利。”英雄的越南人民正满怀必胜的信心，英勇无畏，不怕牺牲，坚持持久战争，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    我们中国人民解放军，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的。我们坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，随时准备援助越南人民，同越南人民一起打败美帝国主义这只野心狼。
    越南南方人民必胜！
    美帝国主义必败！
