The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Hubei Province, with the support, assistance, and leadership of the Wuhan military region, have launched a new high tide of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. A massive campaign to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has been launched and is achieving success after success.

"Revolutionary war is a people's war. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." The urban and rural workers and peasants of Hubei are the strongest force in this "people's war" and the heroes who have overcome factionalism. Due to the selfish motives of the leaders of two revolutionary organizations, factionalism was rampant in Wuhan Zhongyuan Machinery Factory, hindering the revolutionary unity of the entire factory. As early as last October, the old workers of the factory broke through organizational boundaries and spontaneously formed a "Committee for Promoting Revolutionary Unity." With the support of the stationed People's Liberation Army, they organized the leaders of both factions to engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, while propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the masses to resist factional disputes and effectively stop the senseless "internal wars." After the old workers studied the New Year's editorial, they led the masses to cover the entire factory with big-character posters demanding revolutionary unity, held a mass meeting, and demanded that the leaders of the mass organizations fight against factionalism and quickly achieve revolutionary unity.

On the day the revolutionary committee of Jiaxiu County was established, some people from Jiaxiu Middle School, which had already achieved revolutionary unity, pulled out their forces to "shell" the revolutionary committee. The workers' organizations and poor and lower-middle peasants in the county did not support them and patiently did ideological work on them. The factional leaders, seeing that they did not have the support of the masses, returned to the path of revolutionary unity.

The heroic people of Wuhan's process of achieving revolutionary unity is a process of continuously suppressing and achieving victory over factionalism. They use Chairman Mao's theories on class, class struggle, and people's war to make a comprehensive analysis and correct assessment of the political situation and class forces. With the support and help of the People's Liberation Army, they use the principle of "three firsts and three lasts" to launch a sweeping campaign against factionalism. This means: first workers' organizations, then other organizations; first grassroots mass organizations, then city-wide mass organizations; first weak links of factionalism, then stubborn strongholds of factionalism. By the time the various revolutionary organizations in Wuhan City reached an agreement to achieve revolutionary unity throughout the city, more than 90% of the factories, schools, and other grassroots units in the city had achieved revolutionary unity according to their systems, industries, and classes. The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations are currently studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively discussing revolutionary unity throughout the city, reflecting on Chairman Mao's teachings, looking at the demands of the broad revolutionary masses, learning from the revolutionary actions of the grassroots masses, laying out the crimes of factionalism, fiercely fighting against the "self," conducting self-criticism, and removing obstacles to revolutionary unity.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Dialectical materialism holds that external causes are the conditions of change, and internal causes are the basis of change. External causes operate through internal causes." The key to overcoming factionalism is the leaders' ideological revolutionization, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes are the battlefield for eradicating factionalism.

Many Mao Zedong Thought study classes specifically addressing the issue of revolutionary unity emphasize the combination of internal and external factors. The students regularly go to the workers and peasants to listen to opinions, exchange experiences, and promote each other. The leaders of the three revolutionary organizations in Hong'an County encountered difficulties in co-organizing a Mao Zedong Thought study class in the county. Later, they moved the study class to the old revolutionary base area of Qiliaping and held it among the poor and lower-middle peasants, where they received profound education and finally kicked out factionalism and reached an agreement on revolutionary unity.

Factionalism is a splitter in the revolutionary ranks. The study classes in various places adhere to the principle of joint organization by multiple factions, joint organization by leaders of two factions, joint organization by leaders at all levels, and joint organization by grassroots mass organizations. The leaders of the two factions in Wuhan Heavy Machinery Factory, after studying and multiple consultations, summarized and checked themselves after each discussion, affirmed their achievements, and promoted positive factors, maintaining a tenacious and unyielding spirit to forge ahead and not give up until the goal is achieved. They finally overcame stubborn factionalism and achieved revolutionary unity throughout the factory. Factionalism loves to expose others' weaknesses and attack others' strengths. The study classes use self-criticism as a weapon, lay out the crimes of factionalism, emphasize exposing one's own factionalism, and criticizing oneself.

    湖北围剿派性节节胜利
    革命大联合洪流不可阻挡，有力地推动了革命三结合的实现
    据新华社武汉三十一日电　湖北省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在武汉部队广大指战员的支持、帮助和带动下，掀起了全面落实毛主席最新指示的新高潮。一场声势浩大的围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”蓬勃展开，节节取胜。
      “革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”湖北城乡广大工农群众，是这场“人民战争”最强大的主力军，是打倒派性的英雄。武汉中原机械厂由于两个革命组织的头头存私心，闹派性，阻碍了全厂革命大联合。早在去年十月，这个厂的老工人便打破组织界限，自动成立起“促进大联合召集小组”。在驻厂解放军支持下，一方面组织两派头头在毛泽东思想学习班上斗私批修；一方面在群众中深入宣传毛主席的最新指示，抵制了派性纠纷，有效地制止了无原则的“内战”。老工人们认真学习了元旦社论以后，他们带动群众，在全厂贴满了强烈要求实现革命大联合的大字报，召开了全厂群众大会，要求群众组织的头头狠斗派性，迅速实现革命大联合。
    嘉鱼县县革筹小组成立的那一天，已经实现革命大联合的新嘉鱼中学一些人却拉出人马，要“炮轰”革筹小组。县里的工人组织和贫下中农不支持他们，耐心地对他们做思想工作。闹派性的头头看到得不到群众支持，又重新回到革命大联合的轨道上来。
    英雄的武汉人民实现革命大联合的过程，就是不断围剿派性并取得胜利的过程。他们运用毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争和人民战争的理论，对政治形势和阶级势力作出全面分析和正确的估量，在人民解放军的支持和帮助下，采用“三先三后”的原则，对派性进行了扫荡战。这就是：先工人组织后其它组织，先基层群众组织后全市群众组织，先派性势力薄弱的环节后派性顽固的环节。到武汉市各大革命组织达成实现全市革命大联合协议的时候，全市已有百分之九十以上的工厂、学校等基层单位，实现了按照系统、按照行业、按照班级的革命大联合。正在毛泽东思想学习班共同学习毛主席的最新指示，积极协商全市革命大联合的各大革命群众组织负责人，想一想毛主席的教导，看一看广大革命群众的要求，学一学基层群众的革命行动，摆一摆派性的罪过，猛斗“私”字，进行自我批评，扫除了革命大联合的障碍。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”头头实现思想革命化是打倒派性的关键，毛泽东思想学习班是根除派性的战场。
    许多专门解决革命大联合问题的毛泽东思想学习班，特别强调内外结合。学员们定期到工农群众当中去，听取意见，交流经验，互相促进。红安县三个革命组织的头头，在县里协商合办毛泽东思想学习班遇到了困难。后来他们把学习班搬到老根据地——七里坪，到贫下中农那里办，受到了深刻教育，终于踢开派性，达成了革命大联合的协议。
    派性是革命队伍中的分裂主义者，各地的学习班就坚持几派组织合办的方针，两派头头合办，各级头头合办，基层群众组织合办。武汉重型机床厂的两派头头，经过学习和多次协商，谈一次总结检查一次，肯定成绩，发扬积极因素，始终保持勇往直前、不达目的不罢休的坚韧顽强精神，终于战胜了顽固的派性，实现了全厂革命大联合。派性最爱己之短，攻人之长。学习班就以自我批评为武器，大摆派性的罪状，强调自己的派性自己亮，自己批。
