Billions of red hearts forever toward the red sun. The revolutionary people of the world most sincerely wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

Chairman Mao, like the sun, illuminates the world brightly. Facing the red sun, the revolutionary people of the world have countless words of praise for you; facing the red sun, the revolutionary people of the world most sincerely wish you eternal life! Eternal life!

Please convey our sentiments to Chairman Mao

Recently, a group of Chinese comrades visited the brotherly neighbor Vietnam, where they met with the Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression and for national salvation. Their visit concluded, and they were about to return to Beijing. This news reached a young Vietnamese girl. This girl had read Chairman Mao's books and loved Chairman Mao dearly. She wanted the Chinese comrades who were about to leave to take her sentiments to Chairman Mao. What could she use to express her feelings? She thought and thought, finally taking out her beloved red scarf and asking her mother to embroider her sentiments on it. Mother and daughter worked through the night, embroidering eight shining golden characters on the red scarf: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" They then happily went to the Chinese comrades' residence, presenting the red scarf and entrusting the Chinese comrades to take it to Chairman Mao. They said, "This is the sentiment of our entire family. When you see Chairman Mao, please convey our greetings to him!"

Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for the people of the world

A train carrying many foreign friends is speeding toward Beijing. On the train is an Iraqi friend who works in Beijing. He had gone to London to visit relatives and is now returning. This Iraqi friend, full of passion, told his companions a story about the British people's love for Chairman Mao that he had personally experienced:

It was when he first arrived in London. People heard that he was from the place where the red sun rises—Beijing—and immediately surrounded him. These people, with reverent hearts, repeatedly inquired about the health of the great leader Chairman Mao. Facing one excited face after another, the great image of Chairman Mao, radiant and full of vitality, suddenly appeared in the mind of this Iraqi friend. But he couldn't think of the most beautiful and clearest words to express it. Suddenly, he remembered that in his notebook, there was a photo of Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze River at the age of 73, so he immediately took it out for everyone to see. Chairman Mao's photo was passed from one person's hand to another. Everyone was overjoyed at Chairman Mao's health, laughing and jumping, raising their arms to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

After telling this story, the Iraqi friend said with deep emotion, "Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for the people of the world!"

We want to live forever by Chairman Mao's side

The statue of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, stands shining at the entrance of the international friends' waiting room.

One day, an international train slowly pulled into the station. A European young woman stepped off the carriage and entered the waiting room. She affectionately gazed at the statue of Chairman Mao, then quickly walked up to a Chinese comrade on duty, earnestly asking, "Can we take a photo of Chairman Mao's statue?" She then explained that she was from Denmark. Her father is an old worker who has often listened to Chairman Mao's voice through Beijing's radio broadcasts. He praises Chairman Mao as the greatest genius leader of the people of the world and the beacon in the hearts of the Danish people. He thinks of Chairman Mao day and night. He knew his daughter was coming to China and was overjoyed, giving her an important task: when you get to China, be sure to take a photo of Chairman Mao with your own hands and bring it back. He repeatedly instructed her before she left, "Take a photo of Chairman Mao, this is my greatest hope. We will keep Chairman Mao's photo with us and live forever by Chairman Mao's side."

The Chinese comrade on duty, deeply moved by the Danish young woman's words, immediately agreed to let her take photos of Chairman Mao's statue. The Danish young woman then opened her camera, choosing various angles, taking one photo after another, until she finished an entire roll of film. She said excitedly as she took the photos, "This is truly wonderful, so happy!"

Chairman Mao points out the direction of revolutionary victory for us

In the corridor of the international train, two French young women met a Chinese comrade on duty. The French friends saw that the Chinese comrade was wearing a Chairman Mao badge with the Tiananmen Gate pattern on his chest, so they stopped and, pointing at the badge, said with deep emotion, "Beijing, Mao Zedong," "Beijing, Mao Zedong." The Chinese comrades on duty, seeing how much they loved Chairman Mao, took off their Chairman Mao badges and gave each of them one. They took the red sun Chairman Mao badges, said "thank you," and ran back to their carriage.

Soon, from the direction of their carriage, loud slogans echoed: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" The passengers all looked in that direction, seeing more than thirty young people shouting slogans, each with a shining red Chairman Mao badge on their chest, holding red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," wearing red armbands, and carrying a red flag with five large characters: "Red Rebel Corps." Among these young people were the two French young women who had just received the Chairman Mao badges. These young people told the Chinese comrades that they were students from France, Denmark, Italy, Japan, Norway, and other countries and had just finished their visit to China and were returning home. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China had left a very deep impression on them, and they were determined to learn from the Chinese Red Guards, so in Beijing, they specially made the flag of the "Red Rebel Corps." A French young woman, pointing to the Chairman Mao badge with the Tiananmen Gate pattern on her chest, said, "We are also Red Guards. Chairman Mao is our red commander. We wear the Chairman Mao badge with the Tiananmen Gate, and when we return home, we can see Chairman Mao every day, see Beijing City, as if Chairman Mao had received us on Tiananmen Gate and pointed out the direction of revolutionary victory for us." Before she finished speaking, the young people from various countries shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" The stirring slogans drowned out the roar of the wheels.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman

Revolutionary sailors from various countries coming to Chinese ports all have a beautiful wish, which is to seize every opportunity to learn how to shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" in Chinese and to sing songs praising Chairman Mao. Once, a Greek ship docked in Dalian Port. The Greek crew member serving as the second officer, in order to learn the song "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts," specially asked the Chinese comrades to read the lyrics to him sentence by sentence, word by word, and then he recorded it in Greek phonetics. He sang it over and over again, learning the song in just over half an hour. He was overjoyed, repeatedly shaking hands with the Chinese comrades, and said excitedly, "This is the strength given to me by Chairman Mao!" On another Greek ship, the Greek crew member serving as the second engineer, whenever he went ashore or returned to the ship, or saw Chinese staff on the ship, would first shout in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and then stride forward, happily singing his favorite song, "The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, dew and rain make the seedlings strong, to revolutionize, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought..." Revolutionary sailors from various countries, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, sail across oceans and seas, singing loud praises, spreading them around the globe.

    亿万颗红心永远向着红太阳
    世界革命人民最衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
    毛主席，象太阳，照得世界亮堂堂。迎着红太阳，世界革命人民千言万语把您颂扬；迎着红太阳，世界革命人民最衷心祝愿您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    请向毛主席转达我们的心意
    不久前，一批中国同志到兄弟邻邦越南，访问了正在进行抗美救国战争的越南人民。他们访问结束了，就要回到北京去。这件事让一位越南小朋友知道了。这位小朋友读过毛主席的书，非常热爱毛主席，一心想让将要回去的中国同志把她对毛主席的情意带回中国。用什么东西来表达自己的情意呢？她想了又想，最后拿出自己心爱的红领巾，要求她母亲在上面绣上她的心意。母女俩连夜在红领巾上绣出八个闪闪发光的金字：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”。随后，她们欢欢喜喜地来到中国同志住处，捧出红领巾，委托中国同志把它带给毛主席。她们说：“这是我们全家的心意。见了毛主席，一定代我们问候他老人家！”
    毛主席健康是世界人民最大的幸福
    载着许多外国友人的国际列车，向着北京飞速开去。车上有位在北京工作的伊拉克朋友，他到英国伦敦看望了亲人，现在返回来了。这位伊拉克朋友满怀激情地向同伴们讲了一个他亲身感受的英国人民热爱毛主席的故事：
    那是他刚到伦敦的时候，人们听说他是从红太阳升起的地方——北京来的，一下子围上来了许多人。这些人怀着崇敬的心情，一遍又一遍地询问伟大领袖毛主席身体健康情况。面对着一个个激动的脸孔，毛主席的伟大形象，奕奕神采，顿时浮现在这位伊拉克朋友的脑海，可是他一下又想不出一句最美好、最明白的话来表达。他突然想起自己的记事本里，有一张毛主席七十三岁时畅游长江的照片，便立即拿出来请大家瞻仰。毛主席的照片从一个人的手里传到另一个人的手里，大家都为毛主席的健康感到无比幸福，他们欢笑着，跳跃着，举起手臂高呼：“万岁，毛主席！”“万岁，毛主席！”
    这位伊拉克朋友讲了这段故事以后，深情地说道：“毛主席的健康，就是世界人民最大的幸福！”
    我们要永远生活在毛主席身旁
    世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席的塑像，屹立在国际友人候车室的门口，闪闪发光。
    一天，一辆国际列车缓缓驶进站。一位欧洲女青年走下车厢，进入候车室。她亲切端详着毛主席像，随后急促地走到一个值勤的中国同志跟前，恳切地问道：“毛主席的像可以拍照吗？”接着又解释说，她是丹麦人。她父亲是位老工人，多年来经常通过北京的广播，倾听毛主席的声音。他赞颂毛主席是世界人民最伟大的天才领袖，是丹麦人民心中的明灯。他日日夜夜想念毛主席。他知道女儿要来中国，可高兴了，就交给她一个最重要的任务：到了中国，一定亲手拍一张毛主席的照片带回来。他在女儿动身时再三叮咛说：“照回毛主席的像，这是我最大的希望。我们要把毛主席像带在身上，要永远生活在毛主席身旁。”
    值勤的中国同志听了这位丹麦女青年的叙述，心里非常激动，当即表示欢迎她为毛主席塑像拍照。丹麦女青年于是打开照相机，选择各种角度，照了一张又一张，一直把一个胶卷照完。她一边照，一边激动地说：“这真是太好了，太幸福了！”
    毛主席给我们指出革命胜利的方向
    在国际列车的走廊里，两个法国女青年和值勤的中国同志相遇了。法国朋友看到中国同志胸前佩戴着镌有天安门图案的毛主席像章，便站了下来，指着毛主席像章，深情地说：“北京，毛泽东”、“北京，毛泽东”。值勤的中国同志们看到她们对毛主席是那样热爱，便把毛主席像章摘下来，送给她俩每人一枚。她们接过红太阳毛主席的像章，说了一声“谢谢”，跑回她们乘坐的车厢去了。
    不一会，从她们乘坐的车厢那边，传来了响亮的口号声：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”旅客们不约而同地向那边看去，只见喊口号的三十多个青年人，人人胸前别着红光闪闪的毛主席像章，手拿红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，臂上戴着红卫兵袖章，还打着一面红旗，上写五个大字：“红色造反团”。在这一群青年人中，就有刚才得到毛主席像章的那两个法国女青年。这些青年告诉中国同志，他们是法国、丹麦、意大利、日本、挪威等国学生，已经结束了对中国的访问，正在回国。中国的无产阶级文化大革命给他们留下了极为深刻的印象，他们决心要向中国红卫兵学习，因此在北京时专门制作了“红色造反团”的旗帜。一位法国女青年指着她胸前的镌有天安门图案的毛主席像章说：“我们也是红卫兵，毛主席就是我们的红司令。我们戴上有天安门的毛主席像章，回国以后也能够天天看见毛主席，看见北京城，就象毛主席在天安门上接见了我们，给我们指引着革命胜利的方向。”她的话音未落，各国青年们便齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”激动人心的口号声，压过了车轮的轰鸣。
    大海航行靠舵手
    各国革命海员来到中国港口，都有一个美好的愿望，那就是利用一切机会学会用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”学会歌颂毛主席的中国歌曲。有一次，一条希腊船开进大连港，船上担任二副的希腊船员，为了学习《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》，特意请中国同志把歌词一句一句、一字一字地念给他，然后他用希腊文拼音记录下来。他聚精会神地唱了一遍又一遍，在短短的半个多小时内就学会了这支颂歌。他高兴极了，一再和中国同志握手，并且激动地说：“这是毛主席给我的力量！”在另一条希腊船上担任二车的希腊船员，每当他登陆或回船，或者在船上见到中国工作人员时，总是先用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”然后迈开大步，高兴地唱起那支心爱的歌：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想……。”各国革命海员就是这样怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，穿洋过海，把一曲曲响亮的颂歌，唱遍全球。　　新华社通讯员
