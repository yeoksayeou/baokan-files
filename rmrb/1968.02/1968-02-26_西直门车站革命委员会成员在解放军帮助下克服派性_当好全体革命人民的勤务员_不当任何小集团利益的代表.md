We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people. For Communist Party members, this means standing on the side of the Party, on the side of Party principles and Party policies.

Members of the Xizhimen Station Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the PLA, have overcome factionalism and become good servants of the revolutionary people, not representatives of any small group's interests.

The members of the Xizhimen Station Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Railway Bureau have followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "put the interests of the people first, not the interests of individuals or small groups." With the help of the PLA, they have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and seriously overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, adhering to the principles of proletarian Party spirit. The members of the Revolutionary Committee have strengthened their unity and have established revolutionary authority among the masses. The revolutionary tripartite alliance has become increasingly solid. The entire station is bustling with revolutionary and productive activity.

Xizhimen Station originally had nine revolutionary mass organizations. During the "January Revolution" storm, they united to seize power. Later, due to differences of opinion on the cadre issue, they split into two major factions and fought a few months of "civil war." In September of last year, the two factions achieved revolutionary unity; in November, the Revolutionary Committee was established. This was the result of proletarian Party spirit continually defeating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. However, in the initial period after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, factionalism still persisted, hindering the consolidation of the revolutionary tripartite alliance and obstructing the work of the Revolutionary Committee. The PLA comrades stationed at the station to support the left analyzed this situation and concluded that in the past, factionalism was criticized and the revolutionary tripartite alliance was achieved; today, only by eliminating factionalism can the revolutionary tripartite alliance be consolidated. They helped the Revolutionary Committee members to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and relevant works, and launched a campaign to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Who do they represent? The interests of their own faction or the interests of the whole?

In this campaign to eliminate factionalism, the first issue they addressed was who the Revolutionary Committee members represent.

The members of the Xizhimen Station Revolutionary Committee were composed of the leaders of the original two major factions of revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary leading cadres who leaned towards the two factions. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, they worked together, often sitting together, but their thoughts had not yet aligned. Deputy Director Chen Yinzhen and Lu Desen were originally the leaders of the two factions. Chen Yinzhen felt for a period that Director Dong Nanping (former deputy secretary of the Party Committee) was closer to and relied more on Lu Desen, who had previously held similar views, and suspected that they wanted to marginalize her. With these thoughts in mind, their work was not coordinated, and unity was not achieved. In response to these manifestations of factionalism, the PLA comrades organized the Revolutionary Committee members to compare their thoughts with Chairman Mao's teachings and discussed the issues of "Do Revolutionary Committee members represent the interests of their own faction or the interests of the whole?" and "Are they leaders of factionalism or guides who uphold Party principles?"

Through study and discussion, everyone realized that the Revolutionary Committee is a power organ born out of the Cultural Revolution, not a mass organization, not a united organization of factions, and certainly not a liaison station for factions. Each member of the Revolutionary Committee should be a representative of all revolutionary masses, a servant of the people, not a representative of factional interests. They should uphold Party principles and "put the interests of the people first," not engage in factionalism and only represent the interests of their own faction. Once the issue of who the Revolutionary Committee members represent was clarified, everyone's awareness of overcoming factionalism increased. Director Dong Nanping, who originally did not admit to having factionalism, was the first to make a self-criticism. She said: In work, because Lu Desen's views were consistent with hers, she was willing to be close to him and consulted him more, while being more distant from Chen Yinzhen. This was factionalism at work. Chen Yinzhen also examined her own factional-colored glasses, which made her suspicious and think that others wanted to marginalize her. The Revolutionary Committee members all laid bare their thoughts and made serious self-criticisms. Afterwards, each person was careful to avoid any factionalism in their words and deeds. Revolutionary leading cadres and new cadres helped each other; the original leaders of the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations strengthened their unity. Dong Nanping and Chen Yinzhen even formed a "Red Pair" to help and learn from each other.

Who do they connect with? One faction's masses or the broad masses?

The second issue they addressed in the campaign to eliminate factionalism was how the Revolutionary Committee members connect with the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work with the masses to make the Cultural Revolution even better." From the beginning, the Xizhimen Station Revolutionary Committee, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, proposed that the Revolutionary Committee members should not act like officials or lords, but should frequently go among the masses.

However, many members often preferred to go to the masses of their original faction, and were not willing to contact the masses of the other faction. Even if they had to go, they were stiff and uncomfortable, not as relaxed and cheerful as when they were with the masses of their original faction. In response to this situation, the PLA comrades organized them to discuss the issue of "Do they connect with the masses of their own organization or with the broad revolutionary masses?" Everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Not only must you unite with those who agree with you, but you must also be good at uniting with those who disagree with you," and summarized their own experiences in connecting with the masses. They realized that in the issue of connecting with the masses, there is also a struggle between factionalism and Party principles. To be a good servant of the people, one must thoroughly overcome factionalism and broadly connect with the masses.

After being elected as a member of the Revolutionary Committee, Chen Yinzhen often consulted with people from her original faction when she had matters to attend to. The supply room had five comrades, originally all from the other faction, so she did not go there and had others convey messages. This time, Chen Yinzhen examined her shortcomings in this regard and exposed her erroneous thoughts: My faction's people account for more than 70% of the total number of people in the station, and every department has our people. Except for your supply room, I can go anywhere; without you few people, I can still carry out work. He said: "This factionalist thinking must be overcome. The consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses is constantly improving. If you always work according to factionalism, not only will the masses of the other faction not want to be close to you, but gradually even the masses of your original organization will distance themselves from you, how can you be a good servant of the people?" Once, he went to the passenger service room, and a comrade from his original faction said to him: "Little Chen, you shouldn't always look for those who are the same as you. You should go to the masses with different views more often, so that you can better overcome factionalism and carry out work." Chen Yinzhen drew a conclusion: Connecting with the masses with factionalism will make you increasingly detached from the masses; only by connecting with the masses according to Party principles can you truly unite with the masses. Afterwards, he paid attention to broadly connecting with the masses, especially with the comrades from the other faction, and was welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses.

Lu Desen was originally the leader of the other faction, and their faction had fewer people. When he first went to the masses of the opposing faction to work, he also heard some unpleasant words, and thus had some reservations, fearing that he would be cold-shouldered and encounter resistance when he went to the masses of the original opposing organization. Later, he studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must never leave the masses. In this way, we can know the masses, understand the masses, work with the masses, and thus serve the people well." Based on the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions, he made up his mind, dispelled his reservations, and insisted on frequently going to the masses of the original opposing faction. The freight yard had a total of 25 comrades, originally only one of whom was from his faction. He insisted on going there frequently, discussing problems with everyone, and boldly assigning tasks. Over time, the masses saw that he was truly serving everyone wholeheartedly, so they actively supported him and got along well with him. Lu Desen deeply felt: "With factionalism, you will fear the masses; without factionalism, even the masses of the original opposing faction will have common language."

Do they handle issues according to Party principles or factionalism?

The third issue they addressed in the campaign to eliminate factionalism was the standard by which the Revolutionary Committee members handle issues.

Through study and discussion, they reached a common understanding: Issues should be handled according to Party principles, with Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought should be supported, even if it is someone who has opposed you; whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought should be criticized, even if it is someone from your own faction.

At a recent mass meeting, Deputy Director Lu Desen praised the advanced deeds of Chen Gonglan, a worker in the freight yard, who studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and served the people wholeheartedly. This matter was praised by the masses. Chen Gonglan originally had a hostile relationship with Lu Desen, and both sides had strong emotions. Since November of last year, Chen Gonglan has seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, every day without fail. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought dispelled the fog of factionalism in Chen Gonglan's mind, and she began to actively unite with comrades of different views. In her work, she also served the consigning units wholeheartedly. Lu Desen often went to the freight yard, and Chen Gonglan's advanced deeds were in his eyes and heart. However, should he praise her publicly at the meeting? Lu Desen went through a struggle in his mind. The emotional rift caused by the long-term "civil war" had not been completely eliminated, and publicly praising his original "opponent" made him feel uncomfortable; he also thought, would the masses of his original faction have objections to publicly praising someone from the other faction?... He brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works. "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people. For Communist Party members, this means standing on the side of the Party, on the side of Party principles and Party policies." The great leader Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated Lu Desen's heart, and he felt that his thoughts were influenced by factionalism. Chen Gonglan's actions were in line with Chairman Mao's teachings, so he should support her and praise her.

There was a worker in the freight yard who several times asked Lu Desen for a certificate to handle his own private matter. Lu Desen thought: Although this worker was originally from my faction, his request does not conform to Party policy, I cannot act according to factionalism and abandon principles. He refused the worker's request and gave him patient persuasion and education. He reported this issue to the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee for discussion, and everyone unanimously supported his approach of upholding Party principles.

    我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。
    西直门车站革命委员会成员在解放军帮助下克服派性
    当好全体革命人民的勤务员
    不当任何小集团利益的代表
    本报讯　北京铁路局西直门车站革命委员会的成员，遵循毛主席“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”的教导，在支左解放军的帮助下，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，认真克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，坚持按照无产阶级党性原则办事。革命委员会成员加强了团结，并能广泛联系群众，在群众中建立了革命权威。革命的三结合越来越巩固。整个车站的革命和生产搞得生气勃勃。
    西直门车站原有九个革命群众组织。在“一月革命”风暴中，他们联合夺了权。后来，由于在干部问题上的意见分歧，又分裂成为两大派组织，打了几个月的“内战”。去年九月，两派实现了革命大联合；十一月，建立了革命委员会。这是无产阶级党性不断战胜资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的结果。但是，刚成立革命委员会的一段时间内，派性还在作怪，阻碍着革命三结合的巩固，妨碍了革命委员会工作的开展。驻站支左的解放军同志分析这一情况以后认为：过去，通过批判派性，实现了革命的三结合；今天，只有根除派性，才能巩固革命的三结合。他们便帮助革委会成员认真学习毛主席的最新指示和有关著作，又开展了一场围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的歼灭战。
    是代表本派利益，还是代表整体利益？
    他们在这场围歼派性的战斗中，首先解决的是革委会成员代表谁的问题。
    西直门车站革命委员会的成员，是由原来两大派革命群众组织的负责人和分别倾向于两派的革命领导干部组成的。革命委员会成立以后，他们在一起工作，经常坐在一起，可是，思想一时还没有扭到一块儿。副主任委员陈印忠和卢德森，原来是两派的负责人。陈印忠有一段时间，总觉得主任委员东南屏（原党委副书记），对过去同她持相同观点的卢德森接近得多，依靠也多，就怀疑他们想排挤自己。思想上有疙瘩，工作就不协调，团结也搞不好。针对他们这些派性表现，支左解放军同志组织革委会成员对照毛主席的教导，围绕“革委会成员是代表本派利益，还是代表整体利益？”“是做派性的头头，还是当坚持党性的带路人？”开展了讨论。
    通过学习、讨论，大家认识到，革命委员会是在文化大革命中产生的权力机构，不是群众团体，不是各派的联合组织，更不是各派的联络站。每个革委会成员应该是全体革命群众的代表、人民的勤务员，而不是派别利益的代表。他们应当坚持党性原则，“一切从人民的利益出发”，而不应当闹派性，只代表本派的利益。革委会成员代表谁的问题明确了，大家克服派性的自觉性就提高了。主任委员东南屏原来不承认自己有派性，这次她首先作了检讨。她说：在工作中，因为卢德森和自己观点一致，就愿意同他接近，商量事情就多，对陈印忠就比较疏远，这就是派性在作怪。陈印忠也检查自己带着派性的有色眼镜看问题，就疑神疑鬼，以为别人要排挤自己。革委会成员都亮了思想，各自作了认真的自我批评。以后，每个人都力戒自己的一言一行带派性。革命领导干部和新干部互相帮助；原来两派革命群众组织的负责人加强了团结。东南屏和陈印忠还结成了互帮互学的“一对红”。
    是联系一派群众，还是联系广大群众？
    在围歼派性的斗争中，他们解决的第二个问题，是革委会成员怎样联系群众的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”西直门车站革命委员会在成立之初，就根据毛主席这一教导，提出革委会成员不要做官当老爷，要经常深入群众。
　　但是，不少委员总喜欢到原来自己一派的群众中去，对于原来另一派的群众不太愿意接触，即使迫不得已去了，也是拘拘束束，不象在原来自己一派的群众中那样有说有笑。针对这种情况，支左解放军同志组织他们讨论了“是联系本组织的群众，还是联系广大革命群众？”的问题。大家学习了毛主席的教导：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人”，总结了自己联系群众的情况，认识到在联系群众的问题上，也存在着派性和党性的斗争。要当好人民的勤务员，就必须彻底克服派性，广泛地联系群众。
    陈印忠在被推选为革委会成员以后，有事往往找原来自己一派的人商量。总务室有五个同志，原来都同他不是一派，他就不到那里去，有事也请别人转告。这次，陈印忠检查了自己这方面的缺点，亮了自己的错误想法：我这一派的人占全站总人数的百分之七十以上，哪个部门都有我们的人。除了你总务室，我哪儿都能去；少了你们那几个人，我照样可以开展工作。他说：“这种闹派性的思想必须克服。广大革命群众的觉悟在不断提高，你老是按派性去工作，不但原来另一派的群众不愿意接近你，慢慢地连原来本组织的群众也会对你疏远了，你怎么能当好人民的勤务员呢？”有一次，他到客运室去，原来同他一派的同志就对他说：“小陈，你不要老找和自己一派的，应该多到不同观点的群众中去，这样才能更好地克服派性，开展工作。”陈印忠得出了一个结论：带着派性联系群众，就会越来越脱离群众；只有按党性原则联系群众，才能真正和群众打成一片。以后，他注意广泛地联系群众，特别联系原来另一派的同志，受到了广大革命群众的欢迎。
    卢德森原来是另一派的负责人，他们这一派的人数比较少。他刚到对立一派的群众中去开展工作的时候，也听到过一些刺耳的话，因此产生过一些顾虑，怕到原来对立组织的群众中去受冷遇，碰钉子。后来，他学习了毛主席的教导：“我们任何时候都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好地为人民服务。”他根据伟大领袖毛主席的这一指示，下定决心，消除顾虑，坚持经常到原来对立的群众中去。东货场共有二十五个同志，原来同他一派的只有一个人。他硬是经常往那里跑，有问题同大家商量，有任务就大胆布置。时间长了，群众见他确实是一心一意为大家服务，就积极支持他，和他相处得很融洽。卢德森深有感受地说：“有了派性，就会害怕群众；克服了派性，即使是过去对立的群众，也会有共同的语言。”
    是按党性原则办事，还是按派性办事？
    革委会成员按照什么标准处理问题？这是西直门车站革命委员会在围歼派性斗争中解决的第三个问题。
    他们经过学习、讨论，得出的共同认识是：处理问题要按党性原则办事，要以毛泽东思想为准则。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就是反对过自己的同志，也支持他；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，即使过去是我这一派的，也要向他提出批评。
    在最近召开的一次群众大会上，副主任委员卢德森表扬了东货场工人陈公兰活学活用毛主席著作，全心全意为人民服务的先进事迹。这件事受到了群众的赞扬。陈公兰原来和卢德森是“内战”的对手，双方情绪很对立。去年十一月以来，陈公兰认真学习毛主席著作，每天坚持，雷打不动。光焰无际的毛泽东思想驱散了陈公兰头脑里派性的迷雾，她开始主动团结不同观点的同志。在工作上，她也全心全意为托运单位服务。卢德森经常到东货场，陈公兰的先进事迹，他看在眼里，记在心上。但是，要不要在大会上公开表扬她，卢德森经过了一番思想斗争。长时间“内战”造成的感情上的裂痕还没有完全消除，公开表扬自己原来的“对手”，心里总觉得不舒服；他还想到，公开表扬原来另一派的人，过去和我一派的群众会不会有意见？……他带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导照亮了卢德森的心，他感到自己的想法是派性在作怪。陈公兰的行动符合毛主席的教导，就要支持她，表扬她。
    西货场有个工人，几次找卢德森，要求开证明给他办自己的一件私事。卢德森想：这个工人虽然原来和自己是一派的，但是，他的要求不符合党的政策，我不能从派性出发，放弃原则。他便拒绝了这个工人的要求，并向他进行了耐心的说服教育。他把这个问题报告给革委会常委讨论，大家一致支持他这种坚持党性原则的做法。
