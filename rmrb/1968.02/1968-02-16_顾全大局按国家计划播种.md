Last year, our brigade implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain, increasing production by over 900,000 jin compared to the previous year. However, after the harvest, some cadres and commune members became complacent. When discussing this year's production plan, some cadres said, "Our brigade has secured enough grain, so we should plant more economic crops." Some commune members even proposed converting part of the paddy fields to dry land to grow sugarcane for sugar production. The brigade leadership and the supporting PLA soldiers analyzed these thoughts, organized cadres and commune members to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on "promoting the overall situation" and his latest directive to "grasp grain production firmly," as well as the New Year's editorials from the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *PLA Daily*. They also criticized the reactionary fallacies promoted by China's Khrushchev, such as "money first." Through study and criticism, the political awareness of the broad cadres and commune members was further raised. They said: Whether we can produce more grain this year is not only related to the development of the national economy but also to the important issue of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directive to "grasp grain production firmly," produce more grain, and support the world revolution. As a result, the grain planting area of the entire brigade not only did not shrink but also expanded slightly compared to last year.

From what I understand, some production teams, when discussing this year's production plan, have the phenomenon of reducing the grain planting area and expanding economic crops. We, the broad cadres and commune members in rural areas, must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp grain production firmly," prioritize national interests, consider the overall situation, ensure the planting area of grain crops, strive for an even greater harvest this year, and contribute to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    顾全大局按国家计划播种
    去年，我们大队由于执行了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，粮食获得了前所未有的大丰收，比前年增产了九十多万斤。可是，丰收后，有些干部、社员就自满自足起来。在研究今年的生产计划时，有的干部说：“我们大队粮食过关了，应该多种点经济作物。”有的社员甚至提出要把一部分水田改成旱地，种甘蔗榨糖。大队领导班子和支农的解放军同志分析了这些活思想，组织干部、社员认真学习毛主席“要提倡顾全大局”的教导和“必须把粮食抓紧”的最新指示，以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的元旦社论，结合批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“钞票挂帅”等反动谬论。通过学习和批判，进一步提高了广大干部和社员的思想觉悟。他们说：今年能不能多打粮食，不仅是关系到国民经济的发展，而且是关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要问题。我们一定要不折不扣地落实毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧”的最新指示，多打粮食，支援世界革命。结果，全大队的种粮面积不但没有缩小，比去年还扩大了一些。
    据我了解，有些生产队在讨论今年的生产计划时，有缩小粮食面积，扩种经济作物的现象。我们广大农村干部、社员，一定要响应毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧”的伟大号召，以国家利益为重，顾全大局，保证粮食作物的播种面积，争取今年获得更大的丰收，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利贡献力量。
