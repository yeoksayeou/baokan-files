The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam announced its support for the Alliance of National and Peace Forces, which was established during the revolutionary storm of the New Year in South Vietnam. The committee called on the military and people of South Vietnam to strengthen their unity, heighten their vigilance, and advance bravely to achieve a complete victory.

The statement pointed out: Under the brilliant guidance of the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the entire military and people of South Vietnam have bravely advanced, from cities to rural areas, continuously launching military and political offensives against the enemy, achieving unprecedented great and comprehensive new victories. A surging revolutionary tide has swept across South Vietnam, paralyzing the ruling apparatus of the U.S.-puppet regime and accelerating its inevitable collapse.

The statement said: In this revolutionary upsurge, the fighting forces of the South Vietnamese people have been further consolidated and developed. Many patriotic forces and individuals, many rebel military units have risen up to fight alongside the entire nation for the peace, independence, and freedom of the motherland. The Alliance of National and Peace Forces has been born and has set its struggle goals as follows: to overthrow the puppet regime of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, to establish a people's national united government, to demand that the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys withdraw their troops from South Vietnam, to negotiate with the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to jointly restore the independence and sovereignty of the motherland, and to bring peace, freedom, and happiness to all the people.

The statement said: The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is faithful to its national salvation mission and goals, that is, to unite the entire people, resolutely defeat the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, overthrow its puppet regime, establish a broad national democratic united government, build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and then peacefully reunify the motherland; faithful to its consistent policy of great national unity, ready at any time to act together with all patriotic forces and individuals to jointly strike at the common enemy of the nation, the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam solemnly declares that it supports the Alliance of National and Peace Forces and will strengthen its unity with the Alliance to strike at the United States and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky regime, to save the nation.

The statement calls on all forces and individuals who hope for the independence and freedom of our nation, for every Vietnamese to enjoy peace and happiness, to place national interests above all else at this decisive historical moment, to unite and strengthen their unity, and to resolutely struggle for an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and then peacefully reunify the motherland.

The statement finally pointed out: The failure of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their lackeys is evident, but they are still stubborn, cunning, and brutal. Our entire army and people must strengthen our unity, heighten our vigilance, enhance our fighting will, advance in victory, launch continuous attacks, and crush all enemy counterattacks to achieve a complete victory.
