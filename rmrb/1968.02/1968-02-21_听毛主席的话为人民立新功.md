Thousands of words surge in our hearts, waves of joy and tears flow!
February 19th is the most unforgettable day of our lives. Our most beloved great leader, the brightest red sun in the hearts of all Chinese and revolutionary people around the world, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, received us, the "three supports, two militaries" personnel. Chairman Mao's health is so robust, and his energy is so abundant, which is the greatest happiness for all Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world! When Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and a radiant smile, waved to us, we were so moved that tears welled up in our eyes. We shouted with all our hearts, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Last January, following your instructions about "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," we rushed to the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries." In the process of supporting agriculture, we always put the propagation of your brilliant thoughts at the forefront of all our work. We conveyed your theories, lines, policies, methods, and policies on continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat to the hearts of the community members. In the extremely sharp and complex struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, with you supporting us, we braved the evil winds and waves, and repelled the enemy's repeated counterattacks. Facing new situations, new tasks, and new problems, we held high the banner, insisted on the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions," mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of community members to encircle and suppress factionalism, achieved and consolidated the great alliance of the revolution, achieved the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and established the revolutionary committee. At the rally held by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee to grasp the revolution and promote production, our support agriculture team was rated as an advanced collective.

"The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Chairman Mao! In more than a year of support agriculture work, we deeply feel that every step we take forward is guided by you; every achievement we make is the result of your brilliant thoughts nurturing us. There are thousands of ways to do support agriculture work well, but the most fundamental one is to follow your great strategic deployment and your series of latest instructions, to propagate and arm the revolutionary masses with your brilliant thoughts, and to guide the revolutionary masses to always follow your revolutionary line.

Most beloved Chairman Mao! You have entrusted us with the glorious task of the "three supports, two militaries," which is the greatest care, trust, and concern for all our military personnel! The front lines of the "three supports, two militaries" are the battlefield for us to make new contributions for the people and the best classroom for us to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. We follow your instructions to be humble students of the masses and, in support agriculture work, consult the poor and lower-middle peasants whenever we encounter a problem. In practice, we have felt that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have deep feelings for you, strong revolutionary spirit, keen eyesight, and strong class struggle consciousness. They are the best teachers to help us change our worldview and carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism.

Most beloved Chairman Mao! Today, you have received us again, which is a new battle cry issued to all of us "three supports, two militaries" personnel and a higher demand put forward to us. We are determined to follow your great strategic deployment, fully implement your latest instructions, and make new contributions for the people in completing the glorious task of the "three supports, two militaries"!

    听毛主席的话为人民立新功
    北京卫戍区某部驻朝阳区东坝公社支农小组
    千言万语涌心头，心潮逐浪喜泪流！
    二月十九日，是我们一生中最最难忘的日子。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖、全中国和全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，接见了我们“三支”“两军”人员。毛主席他老人家的身体是那样健康，精力是那样充沛，这是全中国人民和全世界革命人民的最大幸福！当毛主席他老人家满面红光，神采奕奕，微笑着向我们招手的时候，我们激动得泪花夺眶而出，我们尽情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    去年一月份，我们遵照您老人家关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，奔赴“三支”“两军”的第一线。在支援农业的过程中，我们始终把宣传您的光辉思想放在一切工作的首位，把您老人家关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，传达到社员们的心坎上。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争极其尖锐复杂的情况下，有您老人家给我们撑腰，我们顶妖风，战恶浪，打退了阶级敌人的一次次反扑。在新的形势、新的任务、新的问题面前，我们旗帜鲜明，坚持了“支左不支派”的原则，发动贫下中农和广大社员群众围剿派性，实现和巩固了革命的大联合，实现了革命的三结合，成立了革命委员会。在北京市革命委员会召开的抓革命、促生产誓师大会上，我们支农小组被评为先进集体。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。毛主席啊，毛主席！在一年多支农工作的实践中，我们深深地体会到：我们每前进一步，都是您老人家给我们指明方向；我们每取得一点成绩，都是您老人家光辉思想哺育的结果。做好支农工作有千条万条，最根本的一条，就是紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，紧跟您老人家的一系列最新指示，用您的光辉思想宣传革命群众，武装革命群众，引导革命群众永远沿着您老人家的革命路线前进。
    最敬爱的毛主席！您把“三支”“两军”的光荣任务交给我们，这是对我军全体指战员的最大爱护、最大信任、最大关怀！“三支”“两军”第一线，是我们为人民立新功的战场，也是我们活学活用毛泽东思想的最好的课堂。我们遵照您老人家要甘当群众的小学生的教导，在支农工作中每遇到一个问题，就请教一次贫下中农。在实践中我们体会到，广大贫下中农对您老人家的感情很深，革命性很强，看问题眼光很敏锐，阶级斗争观念很强。他们是帮助我们改造世界观、进行斗私批修的最好的老师。
    最敬爱的毛主席！今天，您又接见了我们，这是向我们全体“三支”“两军”人员发出了新的战斗号令，对我们提出了更高的要求。我们决心紧跟您的伟大战略部署，全面落实您老人家的最新指示，在完成“三支”“两军”光荣任务中，为人民立新功！
