Discipline is the guarantee for implementing the line. Without discipline, the Party cannot lead the masses and the army to victory.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, Cow Heart Coal Mine in Benxi Mining Bureau, Liaoning Province, has adopted methods of ideological education to mobilize the masses to oppose anarchism, further consolidating socialist labor discipline across the mine. The revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

Launching a "People's War" to Surround and Annihilate Anarchism

Last year, this mine achieved significant results in both revolution and production; it was the first in Benxi's industrial and mining enterprises to establish a revolutionary committee, and it completed its annual production target 20 days ahead of schedule. However, amidst this good situation, a wave of anarchist thinking emerged among some workers. For example, some people thought: now that workers are in charge, they can do whatever they want. Others labeled some reasonable regulations and systems as "revisionist black goods" and wanted to smash them all. As a result, labor discipline became lax, affecting both revolution and production.

The mine's revolutionary committee and PLA comrades studied these issues and concluded that this anarchist trend must be resolutely resisted and not allowed to spread, otherwise, it would hinder the revolution and disrupt production.

How to oppose anarchism? Two different opinions emerged. Some comrades advocated mainly using disciplinary punishment against those causing anarchist trouble, suggesting severe penalties. Most comrades believed that overcoming anarchism should be done through ideological education. After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois thinking in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the victory of the Cultural Revolution," everyone realized that opposing anarchism is a class struggle against the bourgeoisie's ideological infiltration into the proletarian revolutionary ranks. For those influenced by anarchist thinking, using only disciplinary punishment would not solve their ideological problems. The correct approach is to fully mobilize the masses to launch a "People's War" to surround and annihilate anarchism, thus exposing its ugliness.

Exposing the Crimes of Anarchism and Digging Out Its Roots

A massive campaign to oppose anarchism was launched at Cow Heart Coal Mine. PLA comrades and revolutionary committee leaders went deep into workshops, mine shafts, and workfaces, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" with the revolutionary masses. They mobilized the workers to expose the crimes of anarchism, investigate its harms, and dig out its roots. Workers pointed out that the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev, had previously promoted "slavery" to make us their "tame tools." Now, they are using anarchism to corrupt us. Both "isms" serve the same purpose: to disintegrate our revolutionary ranks. Some workers said, "Our deepest hatred should be directed at the handful of capitalist roaders within the party; our deepest hatred should be directed at selfishness. Once selfishness enters our minds, we cannot resist the onslaught of anarchism."

Some comrades influenced by anarchist thinking began to realize their mistakes. Every workshop, mine shaft, and team posted big-character posters declaring their break with anarchism. Old worker Liu Fengting expressed his resolve: "'Grasp revolution, promote production' is the battle cry of our great leader Chairman Mao. Adhering to the eight-hour workday and completing the state's production plan efficiently and economically is the Central Committee's requirement for us revolutionary workers. We, the working class, will firmly implement Chairman Mao's words and the Central Committee's instructions." Old worker Sun Fengchun said, "Now, our mine has been seized by the proletarian revolutionary faction. In our work, we obey orders and follow commands, which is not slavery but the true character of our working class. Working casually, doing as one pleases, leaving when one wants, is opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and is anarchism. We will not do anything that disrupts socialist labor discipline." The workers and mass organization leaders of the 361 Coal Mining Team, such as Sun Tian'an, not only actively grasped revolution and promoted production but also criticized those who did not follow labor discipline. Some advised him, "You are not an official, why bother offending so many people?" He replied confidently, "I am a proletarian revolutionary, and I must intervene when I see phenomena that disrupt revolutionary discipline!"

Strengthening Class Education to Raise Workers' Class Consciousness

Most workers at Cow Heart Mine came to the mine after liberation and had not personally experienced the bitter life of coal miners under the old society. Some of these workers were heavily influenced by the anarchist trend.

The PLA propaganda team and old workers conducted in-depth class education for these young workers, fundamentally raising their class consciousness. Old workers like Yao Fuyou often lectured young workers about the mine's history and their own bitter experiences of exploitation and oppression under the old society. Cow Xilin, a retired old miner who had worked in the mine for decades, felt deeply pained when he saw some workers not following labor discipline. He went to various mine shafts and teams, recalling bitterness and sweetness with the workers. When he spoke of how, in the old society, miners, wrapped in sackcloth, eating acorn flour, worked 15-16 hours a day under the overseer's whip, many workers wept. Young worker Wang Lichun had been working carelessly for a while. Through the old workers' recalling bitterness and sweetness, he was deeply moved. He said excitedly, "Before liberation, the older generation worked 15-16 hours a day under the overseer's supervision. If they were not careful, the whip and hammer would fall on them. Now, we are the masters, working only eight hours a day, yet we are still careless. How can this be? This is all due to selfishness, blinded by anarchism."

Through recalling bitterness and sweetness, the workers' love for Chairman Mao and socialism, and their hatred for the old society and China's Khrushchev, were greatly aroused. Everyone expressed their determination to firmly follow Chairman Mao's words, guard their production posts, adhere to the eight-hour workday, and voluntarily follow socialist labor discipline. Worker Gao Haiyin once completed his daily production task in five hours and then went to the bathhouse to bathe, preparing to leave work. At that moment, he thought, "This is wrong: I left my post three hours early without permission. This is not just a matter of three hours; it is not following Chairman Mao's words, not keeping up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is letting private interests invade public interests and is disloyal to Chairman Mao. This is not what a proletarian revolutionary should do!" Later, he deeply examined his erroneous thoughts to everyone and firmly adhered to the eight-hour workday, never arriving late or leaving early, becoming a model of discipline.

Educating Cadres to Remove Fear and Bravely Strengthen Management

Previously, some grassroots cadres in this mine had the word "fear" in their minds, working cautiously, and not daring to manage those who violated discipline. The revolutionary committee then held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres, organizing them to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," raising cadres' awareness of the struggle against anarchism. Through study, many cadres realized that whether a revolutionary cadre dares to struggle against the anarchist trend and maintain socialist labor discipline is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many cadres revived their revolutionary spirit, replacing "fear" with "dare," working responsibly, and managing bravely, with work immediately improving. Once, a shift in the excavation team left the mine early. Team leader Du Qingfu immediately convened a team meeting to discuss this, then organized the shift to study the "Old Three Articles" and related documents, guiding everyone to discuss their thoughts. Through the study, the workers in this shift realized their mistakes, and the shift leader also made a deep self-criticism at the meeting. Later, the organization and discipline of this shift improved.

Cow Heart Coal Mine also promptly established models of voluntarily following socialist labor discipline across the mine, using the power of examples to promote the "People's War" to surround and annihilate anarchism. The Yang Jingyi shift of the 361 Coal Mining Team has long adhered to the eight-hour production, sometimes completing the day's production task but not leaving the mine early. They said, "Production tasks have targets, but serving the people has no targets. We must seize every second to produce more coal for the revolution and the people." The mine then widely publicized their model deeds, calling on everyone to learn from the Yang Jingyi shift. Revolutionary workers across the mine responded to this call, voluntarily struggling against all phenomena that disrupt discipline and voluntarily maintaining labor discipline.

"The army advances, production increases by an inch, strengthening discipline, the revolution is invincible." Through the "People's War" to surround and annihilate anarchism, Cow Heart Coal Mine promoted the thought revolutionization of people, further consolidated socialist labor discipline, and created a situation where revolutionary workers across the mine united to grasp revolution and promote production. The revolution is vigorous, and production is rising rapidly. January's production achieved a good start, and since mid-February, the daily output of raw coal has exceeded the original plan by more than 30%.

    牛心台煤矿在解放军帮助下加强社会主义劳动纪律
    狠抓阶级教育  大反无政府主义
    革命职工齐心协力抓革命促生产，自觉地同破坏革命纪律的行为作斗争
    本报讯　辽宁省本溪矿务局牛心台煤矿，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，采取思想教育的方法，发动群众反对无政府主义，使全矿社会主义劳动纪律进一步巩固，革命和生产的形势越来越好。
    打一场围歼无政府主义的“人民战争”
    去年，这个矿的革命和生产取得了很大成绩，在本溪地区工矿企业中最先成立了革命委员会；生产提前二十一天完成全年任务。但是，在一片大好形势下，在一部分职工中出现了一股无政府主义思潮。比如，有的人认为：现在是工人说了算，愿意咋干就咋干。有的人把一些合理的规章制度，也说成是“修正主义的黑货”，要统统砸烂。因此，出现劳动纪律松弛的现象，革命和生产受到影响。
    矿革命委员会和解放军同志一起研究了这些情况，认为对这种无政府主义思潮，必须坚决抵制，不能任其泛滥，否则就会阻碍革命，破坏生产。
    怎样反对无政府主义呢？出现了两种不同的意见。有的同志主张，对闹无政府主义的人，主要的应当实行纪律制裁，要狠狠地处分。多数同志认为，克服无政府主义还是要采用思想教育的办法。后来大家反复学习了毛主席“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题”的最新指示，认识到反对无政府主义，是打退资产阶级思想向无产阶级革命队伍进攻的一场阶级斗争。对于受到无政府主义思潮侵蚀的人，如果单纯采取纪律制裁的办法，是解决不了他们的思想问题的。正确的做法是：充分发动群众，开展围歼无政府主义的“人民战争”，这样才能把无政府主义搞臭。
    大摆无政府主义罪状，大挖无政府主义毒根
    一场大反无政府主义的“人民战争”，在牛心台煤矿轰轰烈烈地开展起来。驻这个矿的解放军同志和革委会领导人，深入到车间、坑口和掌子面，和广大革命群众共同学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，学习《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》，发动群众大摆无政府主义的罪状，大查无政府主义的危害，大挖无政府主义的毒根。工人们指出：以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派过去抛出“奴隶主义”，要我们给他们当“驯服工具”；现在，他们又用无政府主义来腐蚀我们。两个“主义”，一个目的，都是企图瓦解我们的革命队伍。有的工人说：“千恨万恨，要恨在党内最大的一小撮走资派身上；千恨万恨，要恨在私字上。头脑里有了私字，就抵抗不了无政府主义的进攻。”
    一些受过无政府主义思潮影响的同志，纷纷认识到自己的错误。各个车间、坑口、班组都贴出了与无政府主义决裂的大字报。老工人刘凤廷表示决心说：“‘抓革命，促生产’是我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的战斗号令。坚持八小时工作制，多快好省地完成国家生产计划，是党中央对我们革命工人的要求。毛主席的话，党中央的指示，我们工人阶级坚决执行。”老工人孙凤春说：“现在我们矿上，无产阶级革命派已经夺了权。我们在工作中服从命令听指挥，决不是什么奴隶主义，那是咱工人阶级的本色。干活随随便便，想干就干，想走就走，那是和毛主席的革命路线相对抗的无政府主义。这种破坏社会主义劳动纪律的事，我们坚决不干。”三六一采煤队的工人、群众组织负责人孙天安，不仅积极抓革命、促生产，而且见到有人不遵守劳动纪律，就提出批评。有的人劝他说：“你又不是干部，何必得罪那么多人？”他理直气壮地说：“我是无产阶级革命派，见到破坏革命纪律的现象，就是要管！”
    狠抓阶级教育，提高工人的阶级觉悟
    牛心台矿的工人，大部分是解放后进矿的。他们对旧社会煤矿工人受剥削、受压迫的苦难生活没有亲身体会。工人当中的一部分人，受无政府主义思潮侵蚀最厉害。
　　解放军宣传队和老工人们一道，对这些青年工人进行了深入的阶级教育，从根本上提高他们的阶级觉悟。老工人姚福友等，经常给青年工人讲矿山史和自己在旧社会受剥削、受压迫的苦难历史。牛喜林是个在矿上干了几十年的退休老矿工，当他看到有少数工人不遵守劳动纪律时，感到十分痛心。他就到各个坑口、班组，同职工一起忆苦思甜。当他讲到在旧社会，矿工披着麻袋片，吃着橡子面，在工头的皮鞭下一天要劳动十五六个小时的时候，许多工人都泣不成声。青年工人王立春有一段时间干活马马虎虎，不够认真。通过老工人忆苦思甜，受到很大教育。他激动地说：解放前，老一辈子在工头的监督下一天要干上十几个小时的活儿，稍不注意，皮鞭、榔头就要打在身上。现在，我们当家做主，每天只干八小时的工作，自己还吊儿郎当，这怎么行呢？这都是“私”字作怪，被无政府主义蒙住了眼睛。
    通过忆苦思甜，大大激发了广大工人对毛主席、对社会主义的无比热爱，对旧社会、对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比憎恨。大家纷纷表示：坚决听毛主席的话，坚守生产岗位，坚持八小时工作制，自觉遵守社会主义劳动纪律。工人高海印，有一天用五个小时完成了当天的生产任务后，便升坑到澡堂子洗澡，准备下班。这时，他想到自己这样做很不对头：我私自提前离开工作岗位三小时，这实际上不是三小时的问题，而是没有听毛主席的话，没有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，离开了毛主席的革命路线，这是以私侵犯了公，是对毛主席不忠。这不是一个无产阶级革命派应该做的！以后，他深刻地向大伙检查了自己的错误思想，并坚持八小时工作，从不迟到早退，成为遵守劳动纪律的模范。教育干部去掉“怕”字，大胆加强管理
    前一时期，这个矿有些基层干部，思想上“怕”字当头，工作缩手缩脚，对于一些违犯纪律的行为不敢大胆管理。矿革委会便举办干部毛泽东思想学习班，组织他们学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，提高干部对反对无政府主义斗争的认识。通过学习，许多干部认识到：一个革命干部敢不敢向无政府主义思潮进行斗争，敢不敢维护社会主义劳动纪律，这是忠不忠于毛主席革命路线的大问题。许多干部振作起革命精神，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，认真负责，大胆管理，工作立见起色。有一次，掘进队一个班提前升井，队长杜庆福发现后，立即召开队委会进行了研究，然后组织这个班学习“老三篇”和有关文件，引导大家结合自己的思想进行讨论。通过学习，这个班的工人认识到了自己的错误，班长也在会上作了深刻检查。以后，这个班的组织性、纪律性加强了。
    牛心台煤矿还在全矿及时树立自觉遵守社会主义劳动纪律的活样板，运用榜样的力量推动围歼无政府主义的“人民战争”。三六一采煤队杨景义班，长期以来坚持八小时生产，有时把当天的生产任务完成了，也不提前升井。他们说：“生产任务有指标，为人民服务没有指标，我们要分秒必争地为革命、为人民多产煤炭。”矿上就大张旗鼓地宣传他们的模范事迹，号召大家向杨景义班学习。广大革命职工响应这个号召，自觉地向一切破坏纪律的行为作斗争，自觉地维护劳动纪律。
    “军队向前进，生产长一寸，加强纪律性，革命无不胜。”牛心台煤矿通过围歼无政府主义的“人民战争”，促进了人的思想革命化，进一步巩固了社会主义劳动纪律，出现了一个全矿革命职工齐心抓革命、合力促生产的大好局面，革命轰轰烈烈，生产直线上升。一月份生产实现了开门红，二月中旬以来，原煤日产量已经超过原计划百分之三十以上。
