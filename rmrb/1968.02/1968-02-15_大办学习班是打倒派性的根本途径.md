The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed: "Conducting study sessions is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study sessions." Experience has proven that holding Mao Zedong Thought study sessions, especially those attended by both factions with differing viewpoints, is the fundamental way to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Just as all things in the world have duality, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism also has duality. On one hand, it is like a venomous snake, entangling and biting people, disrupting the great alliance of revolution, and obstructing the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. On the other hand, when it encounters the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, it is merely a paper tiger, a paper snake. Isn't this true? In places where factionalism was once rampant, as long as Mao Zedong Thought study sessions are held, both factions sit down together, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Both sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes; let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should engage in more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences." Factionalism will then be exposed, with nowhere to hide or wreak havoc.

Some comrades still do not fully understand that conducting Mao Zedong Thought study sessions is the fundamental way to overcome factionalism. They say, "We are very busy with work, how can we find time to conduct study sessions?" "The antagonistic sentiments between the two factions here are still very strong, how can we conduct study sessions?" These comrades do not understand that the fundamental reason why the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions are still so strong is that they have not grasped Mao Zedong Thought education and have not conducted good Mao Zedong Thought study sessions.

To conduct good Mao Zedong Thought study sessions, the key is to establish the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, which is Marxism-Leninism. One must link theory with practice and conduct serious self-criticism. The Mao Zedong Thought study sessions should be seen as a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating private and revisionist tendencies, and as a crucible for transforming one's worldview.

### 大办学习班是打倒派性的根本途径

    大办学习班是打倒派性的根本途径
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指示：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”事实证明，举办毛泽东思想学习班，特别是举办有不同观点的两派参加的学习班，是打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的根本途径。
    同世界上一切事物无不具有两重性一样，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性也有两重性。一方面它象一条大毒蛇，缠人咬人，破坏革命大联合，阻碍毛主席最新指示的全面落实。另一面，它一遇战无不胜的毛泽东思想，也不过是一只纸老虎，一条纸蛇。难道不是这样吗？那些派性一度闹得极凶的地方，只要一举办毛泽东思想学习班，两派坐下来，学习毛主席的最新指示，遵照毛主席的教导：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”派性就原形毕露，无处可窜，无法逞凶。
    有些同志至今还对举办毛泽东思想学习班是打倒派性的根本途径这一点认识不足。他们说：“我们工作很忙呀，那有时间举办毛泽东思想学习班？”“我们这里两大派对立情绪还很严重呀，又怎么举办毛泽东思想学习班？”这些同志不明白，两大派对立情绪之所以还十分严重，最根本的原因，就是没有抓毛泽东思想教育，没有办好毛泽东思想学习班。
    要办好毛泽东思想学习班，关键是树立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，要理论联系实际，要认真进行自我批评。把毛泽东思想学习班当作斗私批修的战场，当作改造世界观的熔炉。　（《浙江日报》二月八日社论）
