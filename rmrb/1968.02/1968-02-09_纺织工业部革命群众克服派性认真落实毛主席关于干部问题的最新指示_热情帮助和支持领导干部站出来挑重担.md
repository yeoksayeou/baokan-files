The revolutionary masses of the Ministry of Textile Industry have overcome factionalism, seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres, and enthusiastically helped and supported leading cadres to step forward and shoulder responsibilities.

More than 80% of the bureau and department-level cadres are working together with the broad revolutionary masses to criticize and repudiate their selfishness and revisionism, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to promote revolution and production. This has played a very good role in consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units.

Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in units. This must be resolved."

What is the obstacle to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions at present? The process of liberating a large number of leading cadres in the Ministry of Textile Industry shows that the biggest obstacle is the reactionary bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Standing on the position of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to handle cadres will prevent a large number of revolutionary leading cadres from stepping forward, while a handful of bad elements will go unpunished and may even be protected.

Revolutionary leading cadres are a very precious asset of our Party. Through the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have received profound education, and their world outlook has been further transformed. Today, with the help of the revolutionary masses, they have stepped forward with a new fighting posture to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the revolution, playing a core role. This is an important manifestation of their firm stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and their close following of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Therefore, helping cadres who have made mistakes to step forward and revolutionize is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; conversely, allowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to run rampant and obstructing the liberation of cadres is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao.

"Discard erroneous views, and cadres will stand before you." Every revolutionary comrade must follow Chairman Mao's teaching, adhere to the principles of proletarian party spirit, thoroughly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and help a large number of cadres to step forward and revolutionize!

New China News Agency, February 8th: With the help of the PLA comrades stationed in the Ministry, the revolutionary masses of the Ministry of Textile Industry, after achieving revolutionary great alliance, continue to take "criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism" as the key task, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, seriously implement the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres, and help leading cadres who have made mistakes to step forward and revolutionize. At present, more than 80% of the bureau and department-level cadres in the Ministry of Textile Industry are working together with the broad revolutionary masses to criticize and repudiate their selfishness and revisionism, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to promote revolution and production. This has played a very good role in consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, and the entire ministry has presented a lively scene.

The Ministry of Textile Industry originally had two revolutionary mass organizations. As early as last October, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, these two organizations achieved revolutionary great alliance by administrative departments and established the Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee of the ministry. However, the disagreements between the two factions on the cadre issue have not been completely eliminated. Some of these disagreements are due to different views on the mistakes of cadres, and many are due to the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. When some comrades encounter the cadre issue where the two factions originally had disagreements, factionalism would unconsciously flare up, and there would be heated arguments. This affected the timely help to cadres who had made mistakes to step forward and revolutionize, and was not conducive to consolidating the revolutionary great alliance.

In view of this situation, the Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee of the ministry, with the help of the PLA comrades stationed in the ministry, further studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's cadre policy, mobilized the masses to continue to expose and criticize their selfishness, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthen proletarian party spirit. They first required the leaders of the mass organizations to expose their active thoughts and then check against Chairman Mao's instructions. A leader of the Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee said in his self-criticism: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in units. This must be resolved.' But I replaced the Party's policy with factionalism. As long as I heard that cadres who were inclined to my faction could step forward, I was happy and tried to create conditions for these cadres who had made mistakes to step forward; while for those who were not inclined to my faction, I did not care and even picked faults in many ways. This violated Chairman Mao's teachings and could not correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy."

The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations took the lead in exposing and criticizing their selfishness, which inspired the masses. Everyone realized that with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, they could not correctly handle cadres with Mao Zedong Thought and could not implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadres, they must break with selfishness and establish public spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthen proletarian party spirit. Once, after a leading cadre of a certain company made a self-criticism, the masses basically agreed, but a comrade from a certain section still raised many opinions. Later, this comrade, through serious discussion, found that some of his opinions were based on factionalism because this leading cadre was originally not inclined to his faction, and everyone had a resistant attitude towards his self-criticism. After the discussion, they raised their awareness, and this comrade voluntarily withdrew the part of the opinions that were based on factionalism. This leading cadre also, with the help of the mass organization, specially went to this section to accept the criticism of the masses. After everyone unified their understanding on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, they helped the cadres and educated themselves.

In the process of liberating cadres, the revolutionary masses of the Ministry of Textile Industry, by continuously overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthening proletarian party spirit, have had a deeper understanding of the great leader Chairman Mao's cadre policy. With a highly responsible spirit towards the Party and the people, when reviewing the mistakes made by cadres during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they also carefully understood the entire history and work of these cadres. Starting from loving and caring for cadres, for those who made mistakes, even serious mistakes, but still belonged to the contradictions within the people, they helped them to bravely step forward and revolutionize with deep class feelings, seriously and patiently. For cadres at the level of bureau and department heads and above, they also generally established help groups composed of masses originally belonging to the two factions to be responsible for investigating and verifying the materials of the mistakes made by cadres, collecting the opinions of the masses, and at the same time helping cadres to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raise their awareness, correct their attitudes, and consciously revolutionize. In addition, they also prioritized arranging cadres at the level of section heads and above to enter Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, more than 100 cadres at the level of section heads and above in the Ministry of Textile Industry have basically all studied in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of these cadres.

After overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, the revolutionary masses of the Ministry of Textile Industry are more realistic in handling the mistakes of cadres. They, based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "all issues of ideological nature and all issues of disputes within the people can only be resolved by democratic methods, only by methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education," allow cadres who have made mistakes to defend themselves in the process of helping cadres, and also allow others to defend them. When some cadres have difficulty understanding certain issues for the time being, they patiently wait for a while; when comrades find that their views are inconsistent with the actual situation, they also timely correct their views. In this way, many cadres are moved and educated.

There was a director of a bureau who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, and the circumstances were relatively serious. He had also made many mistakes in the past. At the beginning, he had very little understanding of his mistakes, not only did he not make a decent self-criticism, but sometimes he also had a confrontational attitude with the masses. Because of the repeated ineffective help, some comrades lost heart. In response to this situation, everyone, with problems in mind, seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related discussions on cadres again. Everyone, following Chairman Mao's teachings, seriously analyzed the nature of the mistakes made by this cadre and the current ideological obstacles to correcting mistakes, and continued to provide in-depth and specific help to her, which finally made this director raise her awareness, draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, make a profound self-criticism, and gain the understanding of the revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary masses of the Ministry of Textile Industry used Mao Zedong Thought to enthusiastically help cadres who had made mistakes, which moved the cadres very much. Many cadres actively contacted the masses, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with the masses, and seriously reviewed their mistakes. In the past period, the biggest concern of some cadres who had made mistakes was that they were afraid that the masses would not act according to Mao Zedong Thought, misjudge them, or that the factionalism of the masses would affect their stepping forward and revolutionizing. Now they realize that this idea is actually a lack of belief in the masses and a lack of belief in Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After the cadres dispelled their concerns, they could strictly demand of themselves when reviewing their mistakes, actively seek the help of the masses, go to places where there are more mass opinions to accept criticism, and make soul-stirring self-criticisms, thus quickly gaining the trust and support of the masses. With the resolution of the cadre issue, the superior-subordinate relationship in the Ministry of Textile Industry has greatly improved. Revolutionary masses strongly support revolutionary leading cadres to shoulder heavy responsibilities and do a good job in various tasks; revolutionary leading cadres also often go to the masses to understand the situation, listen to opinions, humbly learn from the masses, and work together with the broad revolutionary masses to achieve new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    纺织工业部革命群众克服派性认真落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示
    热情帮助和支持领导干部站出来挑重担
    百分之八十以上的司局长级干部同广大革命群众一起斗私批修，一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起抓革命促生产，对巩固革命大联合，促进革命三结合和搞好本单位斗批改，起了很好的作用
    编者按：毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”
    当前，落实毛主席这一最新指示的障碍是什么呢？纺织工业部解放大批领导干部的过程表明：最大的障碍是反动的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。
    站在资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的立场上对待干部，就会使大批革命的领导干部站不出来，而一小撮坏人就会逍遥法外，甚至可能受到包庇。
    革命的领导干部，是我们党的极其宝贵的财富。经过轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，他们受到了极其深刻的教育，他们的世界观得到了进一步的改造。今天，他们在革命群众的帮助下，又以新的战斗姿态站出来挑革命的重担，发挥核心骨干作用，这是他们坚定地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上、紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的重要表现。因此，帮助犯错误的干部站出来革命，就是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；反之，任资产阶级、小资产阶级派性自由泛滥，障碍干部的解放，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。
    “丢掉错误的观点，干部就站在面前了。”每个革命同志都要遵循毛主席的这一教导，坚持无产阶级的党性原则，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，帮助大批干部站出来革命！
    新华社八日讯　纺织工业部的革命群众，在驻部解放军同志的帮助下，在实现革命的大联合之后，继续以“斗私，批修”为纲，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，认真落实伟大领袖毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，帮助犯错误的领导干部站出来革命。目前，纺织工业部百分之八十以上的司局长级干部正同广大革命群众一起斗私批修，一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起抓革命促生产，对巩固革命大联合，促进革命三结合和搞好本单位的斗批改，起了很好的作用，整个部机关出现了一派生气勃勃的景象。
    纺织工业部原有两个革命群众组织。早在去年十月间，这两个组织就在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下，按行政部门实现了革命的大联合，成立了部机关的革命大联合委员会。但是，两大派原来在干部问题上的分歧，并没有完全消除。这些分歧有的是由于对干部的错误有不同的看法，也有不少是由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响。有些同志一接触到原来两派有分歧的干部问题，派性就不自觉地发作起来，争论很大。这样，就影响了及时帮助犯有错误的干部站出来革命，对巩固革命的大联合也不利。
    针对这一情况，部机关的革命大联合委员会在驻部解放军同志的帮助下，进一步活学活用毛主席的最新指示和毛主席的干部政策，发动群众继续亮私斗私，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。他们首先要求群众组织负责人摆出自己的活思想，然后再对照毛主席的指示进行检查。革命大联合委员会的一位负责人在检查时说：“毛主席教导我们：‘正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。’但我却用派性代替了党的政策，只要听到倾向原来我那一派的干部可以站出来时，心里就高兴，还想方设法为这些犯错误的干部创造站出来的条件；而对那些原来不是倾向我这一派的干部，就不关心，甚至多方挑剔。这样，就违背了毛主席的教导，就不能正确地贯彻毛主席的干部政策。”
    革命群众组织的负责人带头亮私斗私，给了群众很大启发。大家认识到，有了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就不能用毛泽东思想正确地对待干部，就无法执行毛主席的干部政策。要全面落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，就必须破私立公，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。有一次，某公司一个领导干部检查自己的错误后，群众基本上都同意了，只有一个处的同志还提了不少意见。事后，这个处的同志通过认真讨论，发现自己提的意见中有些是从派性出发的，因为这个领导干部原来不是倾向自己这一派，大家对他的检查就有抵触情绪。经过讨论，提高了认识，这个处的同志自觉地收回了原来从派性出发提出的那一部分意见。这个领导干部也在群众组织的帮助下，专门到这个处去接受群众的批评。大家在毛泽东思想的基础上统一了认识以后，既帮助了干部，也教育了自己。
    纺织工业部的革命群众在解放干部的过程中，由于不断克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，对伟大领袖毛主席的干部政策有了更加深刻的体会。他们以对党对人民高度负责的精神，在审查干部在无产阶级文化大革命中所犯的错误时，还详细了解这些干部的全部历史和全部工作。他们从爱护和关心干部出发，对那些犯了错误，即使是严重错误，但还是属于人民内部矛盾问题的干部，都满怀着深厚的阶级感情，严肃认真而又耐心细致地帮助他们勇敢地站出来革命。对犯了错误的司局长以上干部，还普遍建立了有原来分属于两派的群众参加的帮助小组，专门负责调查、核实干部所犯错误的材料，收集群众的意见，同时帮助干部活学活用毛主席著作，提高觉悟，端正态度，自觉革命。此外，他们还优先安排处级以上的干部进毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，纺织工业部机关一百多名处级以上干部，已经基本上都在毛泽东思想学习班里学习过一次，大大促进了这些干部的思想革命化。
    克服了资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性之后，纺织工业部的革命群众对待干部的错误更加实事求是。他们根据毛主席“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决”的教导，在帮助干部过程中，允许犯错误的干部申辩，也允许别人替他申辩。当有些干部对某些问题一时想不通时，就耐心等待一个时候；当同志们发现自己的看法同实际情况有出入时，也随时修正自己的看法。这样，使许多干部受到感动和教育。
    有一个司的司长，在文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线，情节比较严重，过去也犯过不少错误。开始时，她对自己的错误认识非常不够，不仅没有作出象样的检查，有时还同群众有对立情绪。因为对她多次帮助不见效，有些同志就泄气了。针对这种情况，大家带着问题又一次认真学习了毛主席的最新指示和有关干部问题的论述，大家遵照毛主席的教导，认真分析了这个干部所犯错误的性质和当前改正错误的思想障碍，继续对她进行深入具体的帮助，终于使这个司长提高了觉悟，划清了同资产阶级反动路线的界限，作了深刻的检查，得到了革命群众的谅解。
    纺织工业部的革命群众用毛泽东思想热情帮助犯错误的干部，使干部们很感动。许多干部主动地同群众接触，同群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，并且认真检查自己的错误。前一段时间，有些犯错误干部的最大顾虑，是怕群众不遵照毛泽东思想办事，对自己估计错了，或者由于群众有派性，影响自己站出来革命。现在他们认识到，这种想法实际上就是不相信群众，不相信毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。干部们打消了顾虑以后，在检查错误时都能严格要求自己，主动争取群众的帮助，那里群众意见多，他们就到那里去接受批评，作触及灵魂的检查，因而很快取得了群众的信任和支持。随着干部问题的解决，现在纺织工业部的上下级关系有了很大改善。革命群众大力支持革命领导干部挑起重担，做好各项工作；革命领导干部也经常到群众中来了解情况，听取意见，虚心做群众的小学生，和广大革命群众一起，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
