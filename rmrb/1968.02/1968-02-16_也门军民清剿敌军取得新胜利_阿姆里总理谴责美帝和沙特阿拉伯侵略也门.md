Yemeni armed forces and people's self-defense units, after reopening the Sana'a-Hudaydah highway, have launched fierce attacks on the enemy forces entrenched in the west of Sana'a and along the highway, achieving new victories.

According to a broadcast by Sana'a Radio on the evening of the 10th, the Yemeni army has completed its task of clearing enemy forces in the southwestern region of Sana'a. The royalist troops and mercenaries, supported by American and Saudi reactionaries, who had been entrenched there for several months, have been basically eliminated.

In the northwestern region of Sana'a, Yemeni military and civilians annihilated more than sixty enemy forces in the battle.

As a result of the brave fighting and proactive offensive by the Yemeni military and civilians, by now, the important hills and high points around the capital Sana'a have basically been controlled by the republic. The enemy's siege and blockade of the capital have been broken.

According to a broadcast by Sana'a Radio on the 11th, Yemeni Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Hassan al-Amri, in a speech at a mass rally held in Hudaydah and Bani Matar on the 7th, condemned the aggression of American imperialism and Saudi reactionaries against Yemen.

Al-Amri said at the meeting, "The people of Yemen fighting for the revolution have foiled the conspiracies of the Saudi reactionaries supported by the United States. The people of Yemen have created miracles in the face of American imperialism and Saudi reactionaries. The people of Yemen have proven to imperialism and Faisal that the people of Yemen will not allow themselves to be sold out or bought. Any conspiracy will be smashed, just as the mercenaries and all those opposing the republican regime have been smashed."

He emphasized the need to defend Yemen's revolution and republican regime. He concluded, "We are prepared. We will defeat the enemy and annihilate them."

    阿姆里总理谴责美帝和沙特阿拉伯侵略也门
    据新华社萨那电　也门武装部队和人民自卫队在打通了萨那—荷台达公路以后，连日来又向盘踞在萨那以西、公路两侧的敌人发起猛烈进攻，不断取得新的胜利。
    据萨那电台十日晚广播，也门军队在萨那西南地区清剿敌军的战斗任务已经完成。盘踞在那里数月之久的由美国和沙特阿拉伯反动派支持的王室军队和雇佣军，已经基本肃清。
    萨那西北地区的也门军民，在战斗中歼灭了六十多个敌人。
    由于也门军民英勇奋战和主动出击的结果，到目前，首都萨那周围的重要山头和制高点，基本上已控制在共和国手里。敌人对首都的包围和封锁已经被打破。
    据新华社萨那十三日电　据萨那电台十一日广播，也门总理兼武装部队总司令哈桑·阿姆里七日在荷台达和贝尼马特尔举行的群众大会上发表讲话，谴责美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派对也门的侵略。
    阿姆里在会上说：“为革命而战斗的也门人民挫败了美国支持的沙特阿拉伯反动派的阴谋，也门人民在美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派面前创造了奇迹。也门人民向帝国主义和费萨尔证实了也门人民是不允许被人出卖和收买的。任何阴谋必将被粉碎，就如同粉碎了雇佣军和一切反对共和政权的人一样。”
    他强调要保卫也门的革命和共和政权。他最后说：“我们已做好准备，我们将打败敌人，消灭他们。”
