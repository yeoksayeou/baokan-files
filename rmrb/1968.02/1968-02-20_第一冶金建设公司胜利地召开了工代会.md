The First Metallurgical Construction Company successfully held a workers' congress. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people of the First Metallurgical Construction Company launched a "people's war" to combat factionalism, strengthened their party spirit, and rapidly achieved revolutionary unity among various mass organizations.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of the First Metallurgical Construction Company established many revolutionary mass organizations to jointly fight against China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Hubei region. However, after achieving decisive victories in the struggle, factionalism began to emerge among some leaders of these revolutionary mass organizations, resulting in a split into two major factions that engaged in "internal warfare."

After Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions were disseminated to the broad revolutionary masses, the First Metallurgical Construction Company launched a great mass movement to seriously study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist troops, they held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, significantly raising class consciousness. So far, more than 90% of the engineering companies and departmental offices at the grassroots level have established revolutionary committees, revolutionary preparatory committees, or workers' congresses.

The broad revolutionary workers strongly demanded the rapid achievement of revolutionary unity throughout the company. They used Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions" to educate the leaders of their own organizations, helping them to strengthen their party spirit and overcome factionalism. Through a "people's war" to combat factionalism, the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations, guided by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, prioritized revolutionary interests and, starting from the desire for unity, actively engaged in self-criticism. In mid-January, these revolutionary mass organizations achieved revolutionary unity and successfully held a workers' congress.

    第一冶金建设公司胜利地召开了工代会
    第一冶金建设公司广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在毛主席最新指示指引下，开展围剿派性的“人民战争”，增强党性，迅速实现了各群众组织的革命大联合。
    第一冶金建设公司职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，成立许多革命群众组织，共同战斗，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北地区的代理人展开了英勇的斗争。但是，在斗争取得决定性胜利后，这些革命群众组织某些头头的派性开始露头，结果分裂成为两大派，互相打起了“内战”。
    伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示同广大革命群众见面以后，第一冶金建设公司掀起了认真学习和坚决落实毛主席最新指示的伟大群众运动。在人民解放军支左部队的支持和帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大大提高了阶级觉悟，到目前为止，已有百分之九十以上的工程公司和机关处室等基层单位成立了革命委员会、革筹小组或工代会。
    广大革命职工强烈要求迅速实现整个公司的革命大联合，他们用毛主席的“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示教育本组织的头头，满腔热情地帮助他们增强党性，打倒派性。经过一场围剿派性的“人民战争”，各革命群众组织的头头以毛主席最新指示为纲，以革命利益为重，从团结的愿望出发，各自主动进行自我批评。一月中旬，这几个革命群众组织实现了革命大联合，胜利地召开了工代会。
