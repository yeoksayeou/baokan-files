For the People's Interests, Fear No Sacrifice

Class leader Li Juntang

The Chinese Khrushchev preaches a "philosophy of life" that everyone is afraid of death, which is a malicious slander against our people's army. We, the revolutionary soldiers of Chairman Mao, fear no sacrifice for the people's interests.

On August 1 of last year, the floodwaters broke through the flood prevention embankment of the old town's Dongguan Fourth Team where we were stationed. The floodwaters roared, sweeping away crops and fields, and the situation was extremely critical. After the troops arrived, I took the lead and jumped into the floodwaters to build the flood prevention embankment. Soon, my feet and legs were cut open with several bloody wounds, my feet went numb, my whole body turned blue, and my lips turned purple. The floodwaters grew stronger, and it started to rain heavily. While pulling trees to block the flood, I was knocked down several times, each time being swept away four or five meters, always facing the danger of sacrifice. At this moment, Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory" echoed in my ears. I summoned my courage and exerted all my strength to fight against the floodwaters, completely disregarding my own safety.

Later, my body could no longer hold out, and I almost fainted several times. The leaders and comrades pulled me ashore to rest. But I thought: This is a battle. A Communist Party member cannot be a deserter on the battlefield and must dedicate his life to where the Party needs it most. One more person means one more strength. Fighting one more minute means less damage to the people's property and more victory. So I rushed back into the floodwaters and, together with my comrades, defeated the flood.

We, the revolutionary soldiers of the proletariat, will forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, and resolutely condemn the "philosophy of life" of the Chinese Khrushchev.

    为了人民利益不怕牺牲一切
    某部班长　李俊堂
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬人人怕死的“活命哲学”，是对我们人民军队的恶毒污蔑。我们毛主席的革命战士，为人民利益决不怕牺牲。
    去年八月一日，洪水冲破了我们驻地老城东关四队的防洪堤坝。洪水咆哮着，冲击庄稼和田地，情况十分危急。部队赶到后，我就带头跳下洪水，筑防洪堤坝。不一会，我脚上腿上划破了几道血口子，两脚麻木，浑身发青，嘴唇发紫。洪水越来越大，又下起大雨来。在拉树拦坝时，我又几次被冲倒，一冲就是四、五米远，时时都有牺牲的危险。这时，毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导响在耳边，我就鼓起勇气，竭尽全力和洪水搏斗，根本没有顾及自己的安危。
    后来，我身体实在支持不住，几次要晕倒。首长和同志们把我拉上岸来休息。但是我想：这是战斗，一个共产党员，不能在战场上当逃兵，要把生命献给党最需要的地方。多一个人就多一分力量。多战斗一分钟，人民财产就少受一分损失，就多一分胜利。于是我又冲入洪水中，和同志们一起战胜了洪水。
    我们无产阶级革命战士，永远牢记毛主席的教导，发扬革命英雄主义精神，坚决斥责中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”。
