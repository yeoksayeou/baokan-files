Chairman Mao is the great teacher and leader of the world's revolutionary people. The revolutionary people of Arabia enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao's words as the guide to revolution, every sentence is the truth.

	The revolutionary people of Arabia have an infinite love, admiration, and reverence for the brightest red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, the great leader Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically acclaim, "Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people," and highly praise, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths, they are the guide for the world's revolutionary people." They say with great excitement, "How fortunate we are to have Chairman Mao!"

	Chairman Mao's health is the happiness of the Yemeni people

	At the ceremony celebrating the commencement of the construction of the Sana'a-Sada Road, aided by China, in Yemen, many Yemenis rushed to the stage to get a better view of the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hanging there. Some people pushed their way to the front of Chairman Mao's portrait and requested that Chinese experts take a photo of them standing under Chairman Mao's portrait. An elderly man in the crowd, with tears of excitement, said that seeing Chairman Mao was the greatest happiness of his life. A Yemeni youth, five times in a row, pushed his way to the front of Chairman Mao's portrait. He enthusiastically shouted in the crowd, "Red Sun! Red Sun!" while pointing at Chairman Mao's portrait. A worker told the Chinese experts, "Chairman Mao is so healthy, this is the happiness of the Chinese people, and it is also the happiness of the Yemeni workers!"

	At this ceremony celebrating the commencement of the Sana'a-Sada Road construction, many Yemeni friends joyfully shouted, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" They eagerly requested the most precious "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges from the Chinese experts. As soon as they received the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they immediately opened it to read. With reverence, they looked at Chairman Mao's portrait in the book and affectionately said, "Chairman Mao, hello!"

	An elderly man told the Chinese experts, "My son obtained a treasure book. This is the happiness of our entire family!" Some Yemeni workers gathered together to read Chairman Mao's quotations collectively. When they read, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history," they raised their thumbs and said, "Chairman Mao spoke the words in our hearts as laboring people."

	Mao Zedong Thought is the guide to revolution

	Once, in the capital of a certain Arab country, a young Arab, after studying Chairman Mao's quotation, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we are for; whatever the enemy is for, we are against," encountered a problem in applying it: the British imperialists are the enemy, but they run schools in this Arab country, should this also be opposed? Later, this young man, with this question, further studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The imperialist powers... do not relax in their policy of spiritual oppression against the Chinese people, which is one aspect of their cultural aggression. Preaching, running hospitals, running schools, publishing newspapers, and attracting students are all implementations of this aggressive policy. Their purpose is to create intellectuals who obey them and to deceive the broad masses of the Chinese people." Chairman Mao's teachings made this young man suddenly enlightened, and he realized that the British imperialists running schools had their own schemes.

	A veterinarian from Mauritania, since 1959, has been continuously studying Chairman Mao's works without interruption. When talking about his study experiences over the years, he said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths, they are the guide for the world's revolutionary people. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world's revolutionary people."

	We love to read Chairman Mao's works the most

	Once, a youth organization leader from the northern region of Mauritania, to obtain Chairman Mao's works for the local library, specially visited Chinese friends in the capital Nouakchott. He told the Chinese friends: The people of Mauritania, through the Vietnam War and the Middle East events, increasingly clearly recognize the correct stance taken by the Chinese people led by the great leader Chairman Mao in international affairs, and thus love Chairman Mao even more. Although the Soviet revisionists sent many books and magazines to our library, the youth do not want to read them and specifically like to read Chairman Mao's works.

	Let students grow up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought

	Once, a young teacher from Mauritania traveled from afar to the residence of Chinese experts to obtain Chairman Mao's works. At that time, the Chinese experts had already given away all the Chairman Mao's works they had, and could only first give him a Mao badge. He happily accepted the shining Mao badge and said: He had 17 students, each of whom loved Chairman Mao, so he also wanted to obtain one for each student. After the Chinese experts fulfilled his request, he gratefully said, "Let each student wear a Mao badge, let them grow up under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

	One day, a young man from Mauritania sat at the door of the Chinese experts' residence for several hours, waiting until the Chinese experts returned from the construction site, just to obtain a Mao badge. When his wish was fulfilled, he tightly held the Chinese experts' hand, expressing his thanks, and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	In Kuwait, a young shop assistant happily told Chinese friends: He recently obtained a Mao badge, which he has always treasured as his most beloved gift. He said, "Chairman Mao is the great teacher and leader of the world's revolutionary people."

    毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师和领袖
    阿拉伯革命人民热情称颂毛主席的话是革命的指南句句是真理
    新华社讯　阿拉伯革命人民对世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳、伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限敬仰。他们热情欢呼“毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师”，高度赞扬“毛主席的话句句是真理，是世界人民革命的指南”。他们无比激动地说：“我们有毛主席是多么幸福啊！”
    毛主席身体健康是也门人民的幸福
    在也门庆祝中国援助修建的萨那—萨达公路工程开工典礼的大会上，许多也门人涌到主席台上，以便更好地看看挂在台上的伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。有的人挤到毛主席像前，要求中国专家给他们拍一张站在毛主席像下的照片。有的年迈的老人在人群中含着热泪激动地说，看到了毛主席，这是我们一生中最大的幸福。有一个也门青年一连五次挤到毛主席像前，他在人群中边看边用手指着毛主席像热情地欢呼：“红太阳！红太阳！”有的工人对中国专家说：“毛主席他老人家这样健康，这是你们中国人民的幸福，也是我们也门工人的幸福！”
    就在这个庆祝萨那—萨达公路工程开工典礼的大会上，许多也门朋友纵情欢呼：“毛主席！毛主席！”他们争先恐后地向中国专家索取最珍贵的《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。他们一拿到红色宝书《毛主席语录》，就马上打开阅读。他们怀着崇敬的心情，一边看着宝书中的毛主席像，一边亲切地说：“毛主席，您好！”
    有一位老年人对中国专家说：“我的儿子得到了一本宝书。这是我们全家的幸福！”有些也门工人聚集在一起，集体朗读毛主席语录。当他们读到“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”时，举起大拇指说：“毛主席说出了我们劳动人民心里的话。”
      毛泽东思想是革命的指南有一次，在某一个阿拉伯国家首都，一位阿拉伯青年学习了毛主席的“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对”这段语录后，在运用中遇到了这么一个问题：英帝国主义是敌人，但是它在这个阿拉伯国家开办学校，难道这也要反对吗？后来，这个青年就带着这个问题进一步学习毛主席的教导：“帝国主义列强……对于麻醉中国人民的精神的一个方面，也不放松，这就是它们的文化侵略政策。传教，办医院，办学校，办报纸和吸引留学生等，就是这个侵略政策的实施。其目的，在于造就服从它们的知识干部和愚弄广大的中国人民。”毛主席的这一教导使这个青年豁然开朗，他认识到英帝国主义办学校，是有它的阴谋的。
    有一位毛里塔尼亚兽医，从一九五九年起就开始学习毛主席著作，从未间断过。他在谈到这些年来的学习心得时说：“毛主席的话句句是真理，它是世界人民革命的指南。毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。”
      我们最爱读毛主席著作
    有一次，来自毛里塔尼亚北部地区的一位青年组织负责人，为了替当地的图书馆索取毛主席著作，而专程来到首都努瓦克肖特拜访中国朋友。他对中国朋友说：毛里塔尼亚人民从越南战争和中东事件中，越来越清楚地认识到伟大领袖毛主席领导的中国人民在国际事务中所采取的正确立场，因而也就更加热爱毛主席。尽管苏修给我们的图书馆送来了许多书刊，但是青年们却不愿看，而专门喜欢读毛主席著作。
    让学生在毛泽东思想哺育下成长
    有一次，一位毛里塔尼亚青年教师从远地赶到中国专家的住地索取毛主席著作。当时，中国专家身边的毛主席著作已被人索取光了，只好先送给他一枚毛主席像章。他非常高兴地接过金光闪闪的毛主席像章，并且说：他有十七个学生，个个热爱毛主席，因此他还想为每个学生要一枚。当中国专家满足了他的要求后，他感激地说：“让学生每人都佩戴毛主席像章，让他们在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下成长！”
    有一天，一位毛里塔尼亚青年为了想得到一枚毛主席像章，坐在中国专家的住地门口等了好几个钟头，直到中国专家从工地回来为止。当他的愿望得到满足时，他紧紧地握住中国专家的手，表示感谢，并且欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    在科威特，一位青年店员遇到中国朋友时高兴地说：他在不久前得到了一枚毛主席像章，他一直把这枚毛主席像章作为最心爱的礼物保存着。他说：“毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师和领袖。”
