The Jichun People's Militia Camp in Xinxian County, Shanxi Province, resolutely implements the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the army and love the people." They firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, wholeheartedly support and love the PLA, seriously and solidly learn from the PLA, and wholeheartedly help the PLA.

Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao, Belief and Reliance on the PLA

In Jichun, whether on the walls or in what people read and sing, there is always this radiant directive from Chairman Mao: "Believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army."

Last January and February, the broad masses of militiamen and revolutionary people, following Chairman Mao's great teaching to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," fought against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. At this critical moment, the beloved PLA came to Jichun.

As soon as the PLA comrades entered the village, they clearly supported the revolutionary actions of the broad masses of militiamen and revolutionary people, encouraging them to resist the evil winds and waves and advance courageously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Then, the PLA comrades conveyed Chairman Mao's great directive to the broad masses of militiamen: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and posted large banners reading "Support the broad leftist masses" and "Swear to be the steadfast rear guard of the broad leftist masses."

The practice of struggle made the militiamen deeply feel that the People's Liberation Army is most loyal to Chairman Mao, most resolute in executing Chairman Mao's latest directives, and most intimate with the proletarian revolutionary masses.

Because the militiamen of Jichun have unwavering faith in the PLA, whenever they encounter difficult knots or deadlocked arguments, they always take out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and say, "Let's go, find the PLA!"

Last April, several key militia cadres from Jichun were elected into the leadership. Later, because of the "self" interfering, they had disputes on some issues. During a rectification meeting, some comrades did not engage in much self-criticism but instead exposed each other's shortcomings, making the situation increasingly tense. What should they do? As usual, they went to find the PLA. At that time, the comrades from the 7th Company of a certain unit stationed in Jichun enthusiastically introduced the army's experience in fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. Comrade Zhao Xinnli, the company commander, also participated in their rectification meeting and helped them fight against selfishness. In this way, they fought against "self" more deeply and established "public" more firmly, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of the leadership cadre and strengthening their unity.

Wholeheartedly Support and Love the PLA

The army loves the people, and the people support the army. In the days of fighting side by side with the PLA, the militiamen and revolutionary people of Jichun have so many touching stories of supporting the army!

When the weather turned cold, each household sent bundles of firewood and blankets to the soldiers. Comrade Hou Zhihe sent the felt he prepared for his wedding to the PLA soldiers to use.

When the soldiers' clothes got dirty, the female militiamen organized a service team to wash the soldiers' quilts and clothes.

When the soldiers fell ill, the militiamen were even more attentive, some calling for doctors, others giving medicine, until the soldiers recovered.

After the troops moved to nearby villages, the militiamen and the company's soldiers continued to visit each other frequently.

The militiamen of Jichun took it as their main task to support the army by caring for and helping the people's sons and daughters politically.

Whenever the troops entered Jichun, they would first introduce the class struggle situation in the village and then hold a meeting to support the army and love the people. For any major political activities, they would seek the troops' opinions and invite the troops to participate. The active members of the militia camp in studying Chairman Mao's works would, upon returning from attending meetings outside, always convey the meeting spirit to the troops, introduce learning experiences from other places and their own learning experiences, and donate learning materials. The militia would also invite troops to participate in study sessions on Chairman Mao's works, criticism sessions, and bitter struggle sessions.

Regarding some shortcomings of the troops, the militiamen would also wholeheartedly help to correct them.

Once, Comrade Wang Yinyu heard at a commune report meeting that someone reflected that the 7th Company of a certain unit, which was originally stationed in Jichun, did not pay much attention to the thought revolutionization of the leadership cadre of Nan Gaocun in the later period of their stay there. Wang Yinyu immediately went to the new station of the 7th Company and conveyed this opinion to Comrade Zhao, the company commander. Zhao was very moved and immediately took three comrades back to Nan Gaocun, helped them set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, and discussed with the village's backbone how to do a good job in thought revolutionization.

Seriously and Solidly Learn from the PLA

"Learn from the PLA, be unlimitedly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives." This is a sentence that Deputy Political Instructor Wang Yinyu of the Jichun Militia Camp often keeps in mind and implements in action, and it is also the common voice and unified action of the militiamen and the broad revolutionary masses.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the militiamen of Jichun took the PLA as their learning example. They often invited military officers and soldiers to introduce their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They learned from the PLA, fought against "self" deeply in their souls, and promoted thought revolutionization. The entire camp emerged with many vivid examples of learning from the PLA and studying Chairman Mao's works.

One day, the comrades from the 7th Company of a certain unit stationed in the area, through visiting the poor and asking about their hardships, learned that the family of Militia Commander Li San was relatively poor, and they sent him grain and vegetables. Li San could not refuse and temporarily accepted them. He thought, the PLA did not just send a few dozen pounds of vegetables and grain, but sent us good style and good thoughts. Chairman Mao taught us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the people's interests." We militiamen should learn the good style and good thoughts of the PLA. So, he did not keep any of the things sent by the 7th Company but immediately distributed them to eight poor peasant households.

The militiamen of Jichun learned the good thoughts and good style of the PLA, and in class struggle and production struggle, they did not waver at critical moments and stood firm in emergencies. On December 26 of last year, a well-digging team of more than forty people, composed of militiamen and the masses, inspired by the slogan of the model of supporting the left and loving the people in universities, Li Wenzhong, braved the cold and set off for the construction site. When they were installing the twenty-sixth section of the cement pipe, four steel ropes suddenly broke, leaving only one. Militiaman Zhang Qingyun thought of Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people and the spirit of selflessness of the PLA. To protect the safety of the four or five comrades working at the wellhead, he fearlessly held onto the last steel rope without letting go. Unfortunately, he was caught by the steel rope and rolled into the well. When the comrades pulled him out, he was seriously injured. But it was forty li away from the county hospital, and such a long journey required Zhang Qingyun to muster great willpower and endure extreme pain. On the way, he repeatedly recited the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, surmounting every difficulty to win victory," and finally overcame the severe pain caused by the serious injury, enduring all the way to the hospital.

The militiamen of Jichun not only seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest directive to "support the army and love the people," learn from the PLA, but also lead the broad revolutionary masses of the entire village to learn from the PLA. Under the leadership of the militia, the entire village launched a campaign to learn from the PLA, set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fought against "self," and fiercely criticized "revisionism." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants said: "We learn from the PLA to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives sentence by sentence, and to implement them item by item!" Now, under the inspiration of the slogan to learn from the PLA, a mass movement to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives is being deeply carried out in Jichun.

The army loves the people, the people support the army, and the army and people are united as one.

    忠于毛主席  拥护解放军
    ——奇村民兵营落实毛主席“拥军爱民”最新指示的事迹
    山西省忻县奇村民兵营，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，坚定不移地相信和依靠解放军，满腔热情地拥护和热爱解放军，认真扎实地学习解放军，一心一意地帮助解放军。
    无限忠于毛主席，相信和依靠解放军
    在奇村，不论是墙上写的，或是人们平时读的、唱的，都有这样一条金光四射的毛主席最新指示：“相信和依靠人民解放军”。
    去年一、二月，广大民兵和革命群众遵照毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导，向党内一小撮走资派斗争的时候，遭到了资产阶级反动路线的种种迫害。在这关键时刻，亲人解放军来到了奇村。
    解放军同志一进村，就旗帜鲜明地支持广大民兵和革命群众的革命行动，鼓励他们顶邪风，战恶浪，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进。接着，解放军同志又向广大民兵传达了毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大指示，并且贴出了
  “支持左派广大群众”、“誓作左派广大群众的坚强后盾”等大幅标语。
    斗争的实践使民兵们深深感到：人民解放军最忠于毛主席，执行毛主席的最新指示最坚决，对无产阶级革命派最亲。
    奇村的民兵由于对解放军坚信不疑，所以他们每逢遇到难解的疙瘩，发生相持不下的争论，总是把《毛主席语录》一拿，说：“走，找解放军去！”
    去年四月，奇村的几个主要民兵干部被选进领导班子。后来，他们之间因为“私”字作怪，在一些问题上发生了争执。在一次整风会上，有的同志不是多做自我批评，而是互相揭短，因而越说越僵。怎么办呢？他们象往常一样，去找解放军。当时，驻奇村的解放军某部七连的同志，满腔热情地向他们介绍了部队斗私批修的经验。连长赵新立同志还参加了他们的整风会议，同他们一起狠斗私心。这样，他们对“私”字越斗越深，“公”字越立越牢，大大促进了领导班子的思想革命化，增强了彼此间的团结。
        满腔热情拥护和热爱解放军
    军爱民，民拥军。奇村民兵和革命群众，在同解放军并肩战斗的日子里，有多少动人的拥军故事啊！
    天气冷了，各家各户给子弟兵送来一捆捆烧柴，一床床被褥。侯治和同志把准备结婚用的毡子，也送给解放军战士盖。
    战士们的衣服脏了，奇村的女民兵组织了服务组，给战士们拆洗被子和衣服。
    战士病了，民兵们更是关心备至，这个给请医生，那个给吃药，直到病好了为止。
    部队移驻附近的其他村以后，民兵们和连队的战士，仍然不断相互看望。
    奇村民兵把从政治上关心和帮助人民子弟兵，作为拥军的主要内容。
    凡是部队进驻奇村，他们总是先介绍本村的阶级斗争情况，然后就召开拥军爱民大会；有什么大的政治活动，都征求部队意见，请部队参加。民兵营的学习毛主席著作积极分子，凡是外出参加会议回来，总要给部队传达会议精神，介绍外地学习经验和自己的学习体会，赠送学习材料。民兵召开学习毛主席著作讲用会、批判会、忆苦会也都请部队同志参加。
    对待部队同志的某些缺点，民兵们也是满腔热情地帮助改正。
    一次，王银娥同志在公社汇报会议上，听到有人反映原来驻奇村的某部七连，在驻南高村的后期，对那个村领导班子的思想革命化抓得少了些。王银娥同志便亲自到七连的新驻地，把这个意见告诉了赵连长。赵连长很受感动，立即带了三个同志重返南高村，帮助这个村办起了毛泽东思想学习班，和这个村的骨干共同研究了搞好思想革命化的问题。
        认真扎实地学习解放军
      “学习解放军，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示。”这是奇村民兵营副教导员王银娥经常记在心上、落实在行动中的一句话，也是奇村民兵和广大革命群众共同的心声，一致的行动。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，奇村民兵处处以解放军为学习榜样。他们经常请驻军干部、战士介绍活学活用毛主席著作和大办毛泽东思想学习班的经验。他们学习解放军，在灵魂深处摆战场，狠斗“私”字，促进思想革命化。全营涌现了许许多多学习解放军、活学活用毛主席著作的生动事迹。
    一天，驻军某部七连的同志们，通过访贫问苦，了解到民兵营长李三同志家庭生活比较困难，就给他送来了粮食、蔬菜等。李三同志谢绝不了，只好暂时收了下来。他想，解放军决不单单是送来了几十斤菜、几十斤粮，而是给我们送来了好作风、好思想。毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我们民兵应该学习解放军的好作风、好思想。于是，他把七连送来的东西，一点没留，马上分别送给了八户贫下中农。
    奇村民兵学习解放军的好思想、好作风，在阶级斗争和生产斗争中，关键时刻不动摇，危急关头过得硬。去年十二月二十六日，由民兵和群众组成的四十多人的打井队，在大学“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志的口号鼓舞下，冒着严寒，开赴工地。当他们安装第二十六节水泥管时，四根钢丝绳突然断了三根。民兵张青云想到毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民的教导和解放军舍己为人的精神，为了保护在井口上作业的四五个同志的安全，他临危不惧，紧紧抓住最后一根钢绳不放，不幸被钢绳绞住，卷进了井坑。当同志们把他救出来的时候，他已身负重伤。但这里离县城医院有四十里远，这样长的路程，需要张青云拿出巨大的毅力，忍受极大的痛苦。在路上他一遍又一遍地背诵伟大领袖毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，终于战胜了严重伤势造成的极度痛苦，一直坚持到进了医院。
    奇村民兵不但自己认真贯彻执行毛主席“拥军爱民”的最新指示，大学解放军，而且还带动全村广大革命群众学习解放军。在民兵的带动下，全村掀起了大学解放军的热潮，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗“私”字，猛批“修”字。广大贫下中农说：“我们学习解放军，就是要象解放军那样听毛主席的话，对毛主席的最新指示句句照办，条条落实！”现在，在大学解放军的口号鼓舞下，一个全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示的群众运动，正在奇村深入展开。
