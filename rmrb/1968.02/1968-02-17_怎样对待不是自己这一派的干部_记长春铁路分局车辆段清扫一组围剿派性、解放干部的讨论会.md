The two revolutionary mass organizations in the Vehicle Section of the Changchun Railway Bureau's Vehicle Depot, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, achieved revolutionary unity. They then organized a discussion to prepare a list of revolutionary cadres for the "three-in-one" combination. The comrades in the Sweeping Group of the Vehicle Depot's Vehicle Inspection Workshop discussed this, and they were generally satisfied with the other cadres, but when it came to discussing the former workshop director, they "hit a snag."

Originally, most of the comrades in the Sweeping Group were members of the "Eternal Red" Combat Team. The workshop director was also a member of this organization at the beginning. However, he later withdrew and joined another revolutionary mass organization, taking a few people with him. This incident infuriated the members of the "Eternal Red" Combat Team. They criticized the workshop director by name and then had him step aside. Therefore, when discussing the release of cadres, whenever the workshop director was mentioned, he was always rejected. One person said, "He is not one of us, so he cannot be released!" Another said, "He did not stand on our side, so we cannot let him stand up!"

The PLA comrades helping the "Eternal Red" Combat Team held a discussion meeting to address this issue. They guided the comrades to distinguish right from wrong according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

As soon as the discussion began, a series of opinions came up:

"He keeps switching sides, which is stirring up the masses to fight each other."

"He supports one faction and attacks another, which is stubbornly carrying out the bourgeois reactionary line."

"We are in a struggle between two lines with him, and we cannot reconcile!"

Everyone listed many "crimes" for the workshop director and gave various reasons why he could not be released.

Old worker Shi Yushan listened for a long time without speaking. He thought more and more that something was wrong and stood up to speak: "Can the reasons given by our faction be the standard for releasing cadres? I think we should first learn from Chairman Mao's teachings!"

The PLA comrades thought Shi Yushan's question was good and immediately led everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues: "The vast majority of cadres are good." "Cadres who have made mistakes, including those who have made serious mistakes, as long as they are not stubborn and unrepentant, should be united and educated."

Chairman Mao's teachings dispelled the fog of factionalism and illuminated everyone's hearts. Each comrade engaged in intense self-reflection.

At this point, Jiang Shifu stood up excitedly and said: "A thousand reasons, ten thousand reasons, if they do not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, they are not the truth. We have fired so many shots at the workshop director, and in the end, it is because he did not stand on our side. Can this be the standard for not releasing cadres?" Another old worker followed up: "Yes! The workshop director is also a member of a revolutionary mass organization and cannot be confused with those who deliberately stir up the masses to fight each other. Chairman Mao said: 'Making mistakes is inevitable, as long as they are corrected sincerely, it is fine.' He has already made a self-criticism to us, and we still exaggerate and hold onto it. This is us being trapped by factionalism in the cadre issue again."

The speeches of the two old workers had a great impact on everyone. Everyone began to discuss passionately. One person said: "If we judge cadres based on whether they stand on our side, we will forget Chairman Mao's teachings and deviate from the Party's cadre policy." Another said: "Judging cadres based on the likes and dislikes of one faction will confuse right and wrong, blur the distinction between friend and foe, and bring harm to the revolution."

After a heated discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the revolutionary cadres who stand up are not cadres of any one faction; they are the Party's cadres, Chairman Mao's cadres, and they serve the broad masses. Therefore, we must use Chairman Mao's cadre policy as the highest standard to correctly identify and boldly release cadres.

At this point in the discussion, everyone had a clear understanding of how to release cadres. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, "Not only should we look at a cadre's one-time or one-event behavior, but we should also look at the cadre's entire history and all their work," they conducted a comprehensive analysis of the workshop director's situation. Everyone saw that the workshop director had a good background, was a cadre cultivated by the Party from the workers, had deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao, and even after becoming a cadre, often helped others study Chairman Mao's works. Although he made some mistakes during the Cultural Revolution, he had a certain understanding of his mistakes and showed signs of correction. Such a cadre should be released.

However, factionalism cannot be completely eliminated from people's minds at once. Some comrades still felt a bit uneasy. One worker said: "He stood against us and fought with us for so long. Now, just let him stand up, I can't swallow this!"

Communist Party member and old worker Zhu Maozhe firmly disagreed with this view. He said: "I think this grudge must be swallowed! This is the factional grudge. If we don't swallow it completely, Party spirit will not prevail. If cadres who disagree with our faction's views stand up, it seems like we have lost. This is looking from the factional hilltop. From the perspective of the working class, no matter which revolutionary cadre stands up, it is a common victory for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, a victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" Female worker Ma Yunqing added: "To prevent revolutionary cadres from standing up for the sake of small group interests, it seems like we have won from the perspective of factionalism, but in fact, we have fallen into the trap of the 'strike a large area, protect a small clique' plot of the Chinese Khrushchev. Who would be happy about this?"

The usually quiet Communist Party member and old worker Sui Lianyou also spoke up. He said: "This year is the year to strive for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution. Whether revolutionary cadres can stand up is a key to achieving the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution. We are not fighting for the victory or defeat of one faction, nor are we fighting for the bourgeois 'factional spirit.' We are fighting for the complete victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fighting for the spirit of the working class."

These workers' speeches had a great impact on the entire group. Everyone said: "Revolutionary cadres are the Party's precious assets. We, the working class, have the responsibility to help them stand up. If we only fight for the victory or defeat of one faction, allowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to run rampant and obstructing the release of cadres, it is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao!"

The discussion became more and more heated. Originally, it was a discussion on whether the workshop director was worthy of being released, but now it was about how to help him stand up as soon as possible. Just as the discussion was in full swing, someone suddenly raised a different opinion: "We agree that the workshop director can stand up, but do we need to help him? Let him check himself, and when he passes, he can be released!"

Before the words were finished, the former leader of the "Eternal Red" Combat Team, Zhang Fushen, immediately refuted: "This is not the broad-mindedness of the working class! Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all of humanity.' Even for a cadre who has some different views from us, we cannot enthusiastically help him, then how can we talk about liberating all of humanity!"

Worker Huang Guozhong immediately followed up and loudly read a segment of Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The cadre issue should start from education and expand the scope of education." Then he said: "Uniting and educating cadres, helping cadres who have made mistakes to stand up and revolutionize, is the glorious task given to us proletarian revolutionaries by the great leader Chairman Mao, and it is our common responsibility as the working class. We must resolutely carry it out and resolutely complete it! We must help cadres who stand on our side, and we must also help those who do not stand on our side."

This back-and-forth discussion made everyone's hearts burn with passion. The sense of revolutionary responsibility and deep class feelings inspired the comrades of the Sweeping Group to decide to help the workshop director stand up and revolutionize as soon as possible.

The discussion continued into the afternoon, and everyone unanimously agreed to enthusiastically help the workshop director stand up. However, the discussion did not end there.

The PLA comrades further guided the comrades of the Sweeping Group to press on and take this campaign against factionalism to the depths of the soul. They used Mao Zedong Thought to inspire the masses to consciously launch a revolution in the depths of their souls.

When the afternoon discussion began, the PLA comrades leading the discussion first led everyone to study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "We must fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." Then, they let everyone discuss why they could not correctly treat cadres who did not stand on their side? Find the cause and root it out.

As soon as the PLA comrades finished speaking, everyone began to discuss passionately. One person said, they were afraid that if they released cadres from the opposing side, it would negate their own direction and they would have no place. Another said, they had previously labeled the workshop director as a "small clique" and now letting him stand up and resume his position, they feared they would be retaliated against. Many people said: The reason for not being able to correctly treat cadres who did not stand on their side had a thousand reasons, but the root cause was a single character—"selfishness." It was the poison of "selfishness" and the harm of factionalism!

The more they talked, the more they touched their souls, and the more they hated selfishness and factionalism. This campaign against selfishness and factionalism became more and more intense. At this time, the former member of the "Eternal Red" Combat Team and the workshop's joint committee member Huang Guozhong stood up to make a deep self-criticism. He said: "Originally, I wanted the cadres of our faction to stand up, so that I could have a share of the credit, power, benefits, and fame. To put it bluntly, we fought for two words—power. Fighting for the power of one faction and seeking personal gain. If we continue to fight like this, we will lose the great power of the proletariat and harm the fundamental interests of the broad masses of laborers. This is the greatest selfishness!"

Old Huang's words struck a chord with many people. At this time, everyone could not sit still and rushed to check their own factionalism and dig out their selfish roots. Many people firmly declared: They must cut off the snake of factionalism and uproot the evil root of "selfishness"! Use Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly reform their worldview and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life! Thus, this cadre release discussion turned into a battlefield where the masses voluntarily opened fire on selfishness and fought against factionalism. They deeply felt: "This discussion was well-conducted! We not only released cadres according to Chairman Mao's teachings but also used Mao Zedong Thought to liberate ourselves from selfishness and factionalism!"

    怎样对待不是自己这一派的干部
    ——记长春铁路分局车辆段清扫一组围剿派性、解放干部的讨论会
    长春铁路分局车辆段库检车间两派革命群众组织，在解放军帮助下实现了革命大联合，接着发动群众讨论准备参加“三结合”的革命干部名单。这个车间清扫一组的同志在讨论中，对其他的干部都比较满意地通过了，唯独讨论到原车间主任时，却“卡了壳”。
    原来，清扫一组的大多数同志都参加了“永红”战斗队，这个车间主任开始也参加了这个组织。可是，后来他退了出去，参加了另一派革命群众组织，还带走了几个人。这件事，惹恼了“永红”战斗队的同志。他们指名批判了这个车间主任，随后又让他靠边站了。所以，在讨论解放干部时，一提到这个车间主任，总是通不过。这个说：“他不是咱一条板凳上的人，不能解放！”那个说：“他不站在咱这一派一边，咱就不能让他站出来！”
    不以一派好恶为标准，要按毛主席的指示看干部
    应该怎样对待不是自己这一派的干部？支左解放军同志认为：清扫一组不愿解放车间主任，是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在干部问题上的一个集中表现，是正确识别干部，大胆解放干部的一个大障碍。解放军同志帮助“永红”战斗队的同志围绕这个问题，开了一个讨论会，引导他们按照毛主席的教导去辨明是非。
    讨论会刚开始，一提起车间主任，一连串的意见就来了：
    “他一会儿站在这一边，一会儿又跑到那一边，这就是挑动群众斗群众。”
    “他支一派，打一派，就是顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线。”
    “咱们跟他是两条路线的斗争，不能调和！”……
    大家给车间主任罗列了许多“罪状”，提出了种种不能解放的理由。
    老工人石玉山听了半天也没有吭声，他越琢磨越觉得不是味道，站起来开了腔：“我们这一派举出的理由就能成为解放干部的标准吗？我看还是先学学毛主席他老人家的教导吧！”
    解放军同志感到石师傅的问题提得好，便立刻领着大家学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示：“绝大多数的干部都是好的”。“犯了错误的干部，包括犯了严重错误的干部，只要不是坚持不改，屡教不改的，都要团结教育他们。”
    毛主席的教导，驱散了派性的迷雾，照亮了大家的心。每个同志都展开了激烈的思想斗争。
    这时，蒋师傅站起来激动地说：一千条理，一万条理，不符合毛主席的教导，就不是真理。我们轰了车间主任那么多炮，说来说去，就是因为他没有站在我们这一边。这能作为不解放干部的标准吗？另一位老工人接过蒋师傅的话说：“是啊！车间主任参加的也是革命群众组织，不能和走资派故意挑动群众斗群众混为一谈。毛主席说：‘犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了。’人家已经向我们作了检查，我们还无限上纲，揪住不放。这是我们在干部问题上又被派性缠住了。”
    两位老工人的发言，对大家启发很大，大家你一言我一语地讨论开了。这个说：“以是不是站在我们这一派来看干部，就会忘记毛主席的教导，背离党的干部政策。”那个说：“从一派的好恶去看干部，就会不明是非，不分敌我，给革命带来危害。”
    经过一番热烈的讨论，大家一致认识到，站出来的革命干部，不是那一派的干部，他们是党的干部，是毛主席的干部，是为广大群众服务的，因此，必须用毛主席的干部政策为最高标准，去正确识别干部，大胆解放干部。
    不争一派的输赢，要争毛主席革命路线的胜利
    讨论进行到这里，大家对怎样解放干部心里有个谱了。接着按照毛主席关于“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导，全面分析了车间主任的情况。大家看到，车间主任出身好，是党从工人中培养起来的干部，对党和毛主席有深厚的阶级感情，当了干部以后，还时常帮助大家学习毛主席著作。文化大革命运动中他虽然犯了一些错误，但对自己的错误有了一定的认识，并且有了改正的表现。这样的干部应该解放出来。
    但是，派性不是一下子能从人们头脑中清除干净的。一些同志心里总觉得憋着个弯子。有个工人说：
  “他站在咱对立面，和咱顶了这么长时间，现在就让他站出来，这口气我输不了。”
    共产党员、老工人朱茂泽坚决不同意这种意见。他说：“我看这口气非输不可！这是派性的气，不让它输得光光的，党性就胜不了。不同意我们这一派观点的干部站出来，就觉得咱们输了，这是站在派性小山头上看的。站在工人阶级立场上看，不管那一个革命干部站出来，都是无产阶级革命派的共同胜利，是毛主席革命路线的胜利！”女工马云清接着说：“为了小团体的利益不让革命干部站出来，从派性看好象咱们胜利了，殊不知正好中了中国赫鲁晓夫‘打击一大片，保护一小撮’的毒计，这样谁高兴，谁喜欢呢？”
    一向不爱多吱声的共产党员、老工人隋连有，也开了腔。他说：“今年可是争取文化大革命全面胜利的一年，革命干部能不能站出来，是取得文化大革命全面胜利的一个关键。咱们是要争个输赢，争口气，但决不是和兄弟的革命群众组织争，是要和党内一小撮走资派争。争的不是一派的输赢，不是资产阶级的
  ‘派气’，要争的是毛主席革命路线的全面胜利，争的是工人阶级的志气。”
    这几位工人的发言，对全组同志震动很大，大家说：“革命干部是党的宝贵财富，咱工人阶级有责任帮助他们站出来，如果只争一派的输赢，让资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性自由泛滥，阻碍干部的解放，就是对毛主席最大的不忠！”
    不能消极等待干部“过关”，要热情帮助干部站出来革命
    讨论会越开越热火，原来是讨论车间主任够不够打倒，这时却研究如何帮助他早点站出来了。刚研究到劲头上，突然有人提出个不同的意见：“我们同意车间主任站出来就行了，还管帮助他？让他自己去检查，啥时候过了关，啥时候解放！”
    话音未了，原“永红”战斗队长郑富申老师傅马上反驳说：“这可不是咱工人阶级的胸怀！毛主席教导咱：‘无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类’，连一个和我们观点有些不同的干部咱都不能热情去帮助他，那还能谈得到解放全人类呢！”
    工人黄国忠紧接着又高声念了段毛主席的最新指示：“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面。”然后，他说：“团结、教育干部，帮助犯了错误的干部站出来革命，这是伟大领袖毛主席交给我们无产阶级革命派的光荣任务，是咱工人阶级的共同责任。我们要坚决执行，坚决完成！站在咱这一派的干部咱要帮，没有站在咱这派的，也要帮。”
    这样你争我辩，讲得人人心里都热呼呼的。革命的责任感，深厚的阶级感情，激励着清扫一组的同志们决心帮助车间主任早日站出来革命。
    关键在于斗掉私心
    讨论了一个上午，大家一致同意热情帮助车间主任站出来。但是，讨论会并没有结束。
    支左解放军同志，进一步引导清扫一组的同志，乘胜前进，把这场围剿派性的“人民战争”打到灵魂深处去。用毛泽东思想启发群众自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命。
    当下午讨论会开始时，参加讨论会的解放军同志，首先领着大家学习了“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示：
  “要斗私，批修”。然后，让大家讨论为什么不能正确对待没有站在自己这一派的干部？找出原因，挖出根子。
    解放军同志的话一讲完，大家就你一言我一语地讨论开了。这个说，自己怕把对立面的干部解放出来，否定了我们的大方向，没有自己的席位。那个说，自己过去把车间主任打成“一小撮”，现在让他站出来官复原职，怕给自己小鞋穿。许多人都说：不能正确对待没有站在自己这一派的干部，原因有千条万条，根子就是一个“私”字。是中了“私”字的毒，遭了派性的害啦！
    大家越谈越触及灵魂，越谈对私心、派性越仇恨，这场围剿私心、派性的“人民战争”，越打越深入。这时候，原来“永红”战斗队的成员、车间大联委委员黄国忠站起来做了深刻检查。他说：“自己原来想让自己这一派的干部站出来，也有自己的一份功劳，有权有利又有名。打开窗子说亮话，过去我们争来争去，就是争两个字——权利。争的是一派之权，谋的是个人私利。这样争下去，就会丢了无产阶级的大权，损害了广大劳动人民的根本利益，这就是最大的私！”
    老黄的话敲在了许多人的心坎上。这时，大家都坐不住了，纷纷争着检查自己的派性，挖自己的私根。许多人都坚决表示：一定要把派性这条毒蛇斩断，把“私”字这个祸根铲掉！用毛泽东思想彻底改造世界观，一辈子紧跟毛主席干革命！这样，这场解放干部的讨论会，变成了群众自觉向私字开火，跟派性交战的战场。他们深有体会地说：“这场讨论会开得好！我们不但按照毛主席的教导解放了干部，还用毛泽东思想把我们自己从私心、派性中解放了出来！”
