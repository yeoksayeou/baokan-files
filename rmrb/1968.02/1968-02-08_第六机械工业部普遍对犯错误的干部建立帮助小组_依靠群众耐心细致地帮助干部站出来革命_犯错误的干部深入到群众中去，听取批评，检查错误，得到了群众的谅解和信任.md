The Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry has established assistance groups for cadres who have made mistakes, relying on the masses to patiently and meticulously help cadres stand up and revolutionize. Cadres who have made mistakes have gone among the masses, listened to criticism, examined their mistakes, and gained the understanding and trust of the masses.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on February 7, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry, which has already achieved revolutionary unity based on administrative departments, follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "start with education and expand the scope of education" for cadres. Based on the work of running Mao Zedong Thought study classes to educate cadres, they have universally adopted the method of establishing cadre assistance groups. They have deeply and specifically helped cadres who have made mistakes to correctly handle relations with the masses and themselves, bravely stand up and revolutionize, and achieved relatively good results.

Currently, cadres at the bureau level and above in this ministry who have made mistakes of varying degrees, except for those whose mistakes are particularly serious and those who are on business trips or sick leave, have, to the extent of 70%, drawn a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line. With the help of revolutionary masses, they have made deep examinations and gained the trust of the masses, standing up. Other cadres who have made mistakes are also recognizing and correcting their mistakes under the help of assistance groups.

Cadres who have already stood up have a completely new spirit and doubled their enthusiasm. They often go among the masses, study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the masses, and fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Some have bravely taken on leadership responsibilities and played new roles in promoting revolution, production, work, and preparedness. In this way, not only has the revolutionary unity of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry been further consolidated, but also favorable conditions have been created for implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry achieved revolutionary unity based on administrative departments at the end of September last year and established a revolutionary unity committee. After the unity, they immediately opened Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres and masses, taking "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline. They mobilized cadres and masses to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with their own problems, solving not only the problem of consolidating and developing revolutionary unity but also many ideological problems regarding cadres.

After participating in the study, cadres who had made mistakes basically eliminated the emotions of opposition to the masses that arose from not understanding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They eagerly hoped that the masses could further specifically help them stand up and revolutionize.

The revolutionary masses, after exposing their selfishness and criticizing it, overcame selfish thoughts and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism regarding cadres. They resolutely used Mao Zedong Thought to correctly handle cadres. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary unity, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. We must resolutely carry it out.' This is the glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao. We must resolutely carry it out." Therefore, when some bureaus established cadre assistance groups, it immediately attracted the attention of all revolutionary masses. In less than half a month, almost every cadre who had made mistakes had an assistance group established for them, forming a mass movement to help cadres.

According to the experience of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry, such cadre assistance groups are best composed of three types of masses: the responsible person of the mass organization in the bureau where the cadre to be helped is located, masses who were suppressed by the bourgeois reactionary line, and masses who were initially deceived but have since changed for the better. This not only has broad representativeness, which is beneficial for helping cadres who have made mistakes, but also can further eliminate the estrangement among revolutionary masses caused by differences regarding cadres.

The greatest advantage of establishing such cadre assistance groups is that they can provide in-depth and meticulous help according to different objects and situations. Many assistance groups, after their establishment, conducted detailed investigations and research to basically understand the main history and key moments of the cadres, their main mistakes, and their current active thoughts. Then, based on the actual situation of the cadres to be helped, they formulated specific measures to help them, prescribing the right medicine and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together with them, providing in-depth, meticulous, and patient help.

Chairman Mao said, "We must handle the relationship between superiors and subordinates well and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres must go down to the grassroots to walk around and see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything, becoming students of the masses." Following Chairman Mao's instruction, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry paid special attention to strengthening the connection between cadres and the masses and establishing new cadre-mass relationships during the process of helping cadres. The assistance groups often informed the masses of the cadres' situations, reflected the masses' opinions to the cadres, and invited masses from various departments to participate in the cadres' examinations, helping and criticizing them. They also encouraged cadres to follow Chairman Mao's words, put down their airs, and go among the masses. Where the masses' opinions are the most, they encouraged cadres to go there, talk with the masses, and actively seek the masses' help. Cadres, after listening to the masses' criticisms, receiving education, and feeling encouraged, felt the warmth of class love. They deeply felt, "In the past, under the poison of the black 'Modesty,' we closed the door to reflect, the more we reflected, the more selfish we became; today, the masses stand up to help us open the door to revolutionize, the more we revolutionize, the more public-minded we become." Some said, "Through this Cultural Revolution, I truly understood the great truth that 'the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and laughable.'"

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry, after doing a good job of helping cadres in a deep and meticulous way, not only made many cadres bravely stand up and revolutionize but also drew many experiences and lessons from cadres who had made mistakes and received profound education. They further saw the harm of bourgeois ideology, understood the necessity and urgency of breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and changing their worldview. Therefore, they more deeply understood the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao. Many assistance groups, when summarizing their work, said, "Not only do we help cadres, but cadres also help us. It is not just helping but more importantly, learning." Therefore, they suggested changing the name of the assistance groups to Mao Zedong Thought Mutual Assistance Groups. The cadres also thought that assistance groups are a good form for improving cadre-mass relationships and accepting the masses' help and supervision.

    第六机械工业部普遍对犯错误的干部建立帮助小组
    依靠群众耐心细致地帮助干部站出来革命
    犯错误的干部深入到群众中去，听取批评，检查错误，得到了群众的谅解和信任
    据新华社七日讯　已经按行政部门实现了革命大联合的第六机械工业部的无产阶级革命派，遵照毛主席“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的教导，在办好毛泽东思想学习班对干部加强教育的基础上，普遍采用建立帮助干部小组的方法，深入具体地帮助犯错误的干部用毛泽东思想正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，勇敢地站出来革命，取得了比较好的效果。
    目前，这个部犯过不同程度错误的司局长以上的干部，除了错误十分严重的和出差、生病休养的以外，百分之七十划清了同资产阶级反动路线的界限，在革命群众的帮助下，作了深刻检查，获得了群众的信任，站了出来。其他犯错误的干部，也正在帮助小组的帮助下，认识和改正错误。
    已经站出来的干部，精神面貌焕然一新，干劲倍增。他们经常深入群众，同群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起斗私批修。有的勇敢地担负起领导责任，在抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备中发挥了新的作用。这样，不但进一步巩固了六机部的革命大联合，同时也为实现革命三结合，开展本单位斗、批、改，创造了十分有利的条件。
    六机部无产阶级革命派在去年九月底实现了按行政部门的革命大联合，成立了大联合委员会。联合以后，立刻开办了有干部和群众参加的毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，发动广大干部和群众带着各自的问题，深入学习毛主席的最新指示，既解决了巩固和发展革命大联合的问题，也解决了在对待干部问题上的许多思想问题。
    犯了错误的干部参加学习以后，基本上消除了原来由于对无产阶级文化大革命不理解而产生的同群众对立的情绪，迫切地希望群众能够进一步具体帮助自己站出来革命。
    广大革命群众经过亮私斗私，克服了在干部问题上的私心杂念和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，坚决用毛泽东思想正确地对待干部。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”这是毛主席交给我们无产阶级革命派的光荣任务，我们必须坚决照办。因此，当某些司局建立帮助干部小组以后，立刻引起了全部革命群众的重视，不到半个月的时间，全部几乎对每一个犯错误的干部，都建立了帮助小组，形成了群众性的帮助干部的热潮。
    根据六机部的经验，这种帮助干部小组，最好由三方面群众组成，即：被帮助对象所在司局的群众组织负责人，过去受资产阶级反动路线压制的群众和开始时受蒙蔽而又转变得较好的群众。这样既具有广泛的代表性，有利于对犯错误干部的帮助，又可以进一步消除革命群众之间由于在干部问题上的分歧而造成的隔阂。
    成立这种帮助干部小组的最大好处，是可以根据不同对象，不同情况，进行深入细致的帮助。许多帮助小组在成立以后，为了有效地帮助干部，都首先进行了详细的调查研究，基本上做到了对干部的主要历史和在关键时刻的表现胸中有数；对干部的主要错误胸中有数；对干部当前的活思想胸中有数。然后，从被帮助的干部的实际出发，订出具体的帮助措施，对症下药地同他一起活学活用毛主席著作，对他进行深入细致而又耐心的帮助。
    毛主席说：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”遵循毛主席的这一教导，六机部无产阶级革命派在帮助干部过程中，十分注意促使干部和群众加强联系，建立新的干群关系。各帮助小组经常把干部的情况告诉给群众，把群众的意见反映给干部，并且在干部进行检查时，吸收各部门的群众参加，对干部进行帮助和批评，还鼓励干部听毛主席的话，放下架子，到群众中去。那里群众意见最多，就鼓励干部到那里去，同群众一起谈心，主动争取群众的帮助。干部到群众中听取了批评，受到了教育，得到了鼓励，感到了阶级友爱的温暖。他们深有体会地说：“过去在黑《修养》的毒害下，闭门思过，越思越私；今天群众起来帮助我们开门革命，越革越公。”有的说：“通过这次文化大革命，我真正懂得了‘群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的’这一伟大真理。”
    六机部的无产阶级革命派，在深入细致地做好帮助干部的工作以后，不但使许多干部勇敢地站出来革命，而且从犯错误干部的身上，汲取了许多经验教训，受到了深刻的教育。他们进一步看到了资产阶级思想的危害性，懂得了破私立公，改造世界观的必要性和迫切性，因而更加深刻地领会了毛主席亲自发动的这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义。许多帮助小组在总结他们的工作时说：“不单是我们帮助干部，干部也帮助了我们，不仅是帮，更重要的是学。”因此他们建议，把帮助小组改名为学习毛主席著作互助小组。干部们也认为，帮助小组是改善干群关系，干部接受群众帮助监督的好形式。
