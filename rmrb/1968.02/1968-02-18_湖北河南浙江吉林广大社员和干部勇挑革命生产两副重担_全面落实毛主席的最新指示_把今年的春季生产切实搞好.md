A magnificent spring production wave is surging across the countryside of Hubei Province. From the southern slopes of the Dabie Mountains to the northern shores of Lake Dongting, from the western mountains of Hubei to the Jianghan Plain, everywhere is bustling with activity. Many counties are focusing on the field management of summer crops, determined to achieve a bumper harvest this summer. Fertilizer production and application activities are heating up, agricultural water conservancy projects are being accelerated, and other preparatory work is proceeding actively. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are brimming with confidence, determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

The outstanding feature of Hubei's spring production this year is that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are vigorously emphasizing proletarian politics, launching a widespread movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, through the struggle to achieve comprehensive increases in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries throughout the province in 1967, have gained a deeper understanding of the great truth that "navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." They have also come to realize more profoundly that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country. Since the beginning of this year's spring production, they have firmly grasped the fundamental issue of promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and promoted the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao. A people's war to combat selfishness and criticize revisionism, to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and to overcome anarchism has been launched across the vast countryside. In just over a month, batches of prefectures and counties have achieved revolutionary great unity, and batches of prefectures, counties, and cities have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary committee preparatory groups, powerfully promoting this year's spring production preparations.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." The revolutionary masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hubei's countryside have grasped this key point, correctly handled the issue of cadres, enthusiastically used Mao Zedong Thought to educate cadres, helped them correctly handle relations with the masses and with themselves, and bravely stepped forward to lead the revolution and promote production. The broad masses of grassroots cadres, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, have thoroughly criticized selfishness and established selflessness, thoroughly criticized fear and established daring, cast off their burdens, stood tall, and actively joined the battle of spring production preparations.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, fighting on the "support agriculture" frontline, have achieved new merits in the struggle for spring production preparations in Hubei's countryside.

A magnificent wave of spring production preparations is surging across the countryside of Henan Province. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," launching a high tide of spring production preparations, determined to achieve greater harvests in agriculture this year in the great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A prominent feature of this year's spring production preparations in Henan is the vigorous emphasis on Mao Zedong Thought and the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. The Henan Revolutionary Committee recently held a meeting to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and arrange for this year's revolution and production in the countryside. The vast majority of counties and cities in the province have, since early February, successively held meetings on grasping revolution and promoting production for cadres at the level of production team leaders and above and responsible persons of revolutionary mass organizations. These meetings, with "criticize selfishness and revisionism" as the guiding principle, organized participants to repeatedly study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consciously criticize selfishness and revisionism, combat factionalism, strengthen party spirit, and make everyone more united and strive to do a good job in revolution and production.

The more extensive and in-depth mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works across the province has powerfully promoted revolution and spring production preparations. Many communes and production teams have, according to local conditions, established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, further criticized the revisionist goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "exploitation is meritorious," and "peach garden experience," further strengthened the determination of the broad masses of commune members to take the socialist road, further established the idea of farming for revolution, and made the preparatory work present a thriving new situation. In the northern and western cotton-growing areas of Henan and the eastern plain, the crowds delivering fertilizer are unending, the land for spring sowing is being plowed, small agricultural water conservancy projects are being accelerated, and the work of exchanging seeds and spring seedling raising has begun. Since the beginning of spring, many regions across the province have strengthened the management of wheat fields, launched activities of fertilizing, irrigating, and weeding, and the current wheat seedlings are lush and growing well.

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the countryside of Zhejiang Province has further deepened the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and launched a magnificent wave of spring production preparations and spring production. The revolutionary and production situation in the countryside across the province is better than ever, presenting a revolutionary scene of vigorous activity and prosperity everywhere.

The main features of the current good situation in Zhejiang's countryside are: three mass movements have developed greatly, launching three new high tides. These are: the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works has developed greatly, launching a new high tide of establishing and running well Mao Zedong Thought study classes; the mass movement to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment has developed greatly, launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combination; the mass movement to learn from Dazhai has developed greatly, launching a new high tide of spring production preparations.

With the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres across the province, with profound class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have already held over 37,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 4 million people participating in the study. The broad revolutionary masses in the study classes have extensively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, implemented and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with "criticize selfishness and revisionism" as the guiding principle, with the "Old Three Articles" as a weapon, with the People's Liberation Army as an example, broken selfishness and established selflessness, greatly promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and further igniting their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses in Zhejiang's countryside, through the extensive study and application of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have further followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combination. Extensive study and criticism have powerfully promoted the great development of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Since last winter and this spring, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres across the province have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," launching a mass movement to learn from Dazhai. They have taken Dazhai as an example, determined to follow the Dazhai path, learn from the Dazhai people, promote the Dazhai spirit, and use the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai to do a good job in this year's spring production.

Under the unprecedented good revolutionary and production situation in Zhejiang's countryside, Zhejiang Province recently held a meeting to grasp revolution and promote production, launch a high tide of spring production across the province, and a wired broadcast oath-taking meeting.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in Jilin Province's countryside have seriously summed up the experience of "grasp revolution, promote production" from last year, and have further implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using revolution to lead production, launching a high tide of production preparations, and striving for a great harvest in agriculture this year. Since the beginning of this year, various places, based on the work summary, have generally held rural work meetings or experience exchange meetings on grasping revolution and promoting production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres have deeply felt: rely on a thousand things, rely on ten thousand things, Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental reliance; win a thousand victories, win ten thousand victories, the great spread of Mao Zedong Thought, and the realization of the revolutionization of people's thinking is the greatest victory.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, the countryside across the province has held over 30,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 1.2 million people participating in the study. Since the beginning of this year, the broad revolutionary masses, with the greatest enthusiasm, the fastest speed, the highest awareness, and the most effective measures, have comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have further launched a revolutionary great criticism and launched a people's war to combat bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Currently, six regions, two cities, and more than ten counties across the province, as well as 70% of rural people's communes, have achieved revolutionary great unity. Many units have also achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination. The revolutionary masses in the countryside across the province have never been so spirited, and their enthusiasm for revolution and production has never been so high. This year's production preparations have been grasped early, and the masses are full of enthusiasm. Over 20 key water conservancy projects across the province are progressing quickly and well, and small agricultural water conservancy projects have completed over 20 million cubic meters of earthwork. Over 60 million tons of fertilizer have been produced, with better quality than in previous years, of which one-third has been delivered to the fields, and the progress is faster than in previous years. Revolutionary workers on the industrial, commercial, and financial fronts are also actively supporting agricultural production from various aspects, making positive contributions to a greater harvest in agriculture this year.

    湖北河南浙江吉林广大社员和干部勇挑革命生产两副重担
    全面落实毛主席的最新指示  把今年的春季生产切实搞好
    湖北
    据新华社武汉十七日电　一个波澜壮阔的春季备耕生产热潮，正在湖北省农村蓬勃兴起。从大别山南到洞庭湖北，从鄂西北山区到江汉平原，到处是一派繁忙景象。许多县正在大抓夏收作物的田间管理，决心夺取今年夏收作物大丰产。各地积肥、造肥活动热烈展开，农田水利建设加紧施工，其他各项备耕工作也正在积极进行。广大贫下中农和革命干部信心百倍地表示，一定要在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的伟大战斗中，力争今年农业生产获得全面丰收。
    今年湖北农村春季生产的突出特点是，广大贫下中农、革命干部大力突出无产阶级政治，广泛掀起活学活用毛泽东思想、落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅生产，指导生产。广大贫下中农从一九六七年全省农林牧副渔夺得全面增产的斗争实践中，更加深刻地体会到“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”这一伟大真理，更加深刻地认识到无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。在今年春季生产开始以后，他们就狠狠抓住促进人的思想革命化这个根本，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大兴毛主席亲自倡导的革命学风，在广大农村中展开了一场斗私批修，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性及克服无政府主义的“人民战争”。在短短一个多月的时间内，一批又一批专区、县实现了革命大联合，一批又一批专区、县、市成立了革命委员会或革命委员会筹备小组，有力地推动了今年的春季备耕生产。
    毛主席教导我们说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”湖北农村无产阶级革命派、贫下中农抓住这个关键，正确对待干部，热情地用毛泽东思想教育干部，帮助他们正确对待群众，正确对待自己，勇敢地站出来抓革命，促生产。广大基层干部遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大破“怕”字，大立“敢”字，丢掉包袱，挺起腰杆，积极投入了备耕生产的战斗。
    战斗在“支农”第一线的人民解放军武汉部队广大指战员，在湖北农村春季备耕生产斗争中立了新功。

    据新华社郑州十七日电　河南省农村人民公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，掀起了春季备耕生产高潮，决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中取得今年农业生产的更大丰收。
    今年，河南春耕生产准备工作的一个鲜明特点是，大力突出毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切。河南省革命委员会前不久专门召开会议，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席的最新指示，安排今年农村的革命和生产。全省绝大多数县、市从二月上旬起，先后召开了有生产队长以上干部和革命群众组织负责人参加的抓革命促生产会议。这些会议以“斗私，批修”为纲，组织与会人员反复学习、反复运用毛主席的最新指示，自觉地斗私批修，围剿派性，增强党性，使大家更加团结一心，努力搞好革命和生产。
    全省农村掀起的更加广泛、更加深入的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，有力地推动着革命和春季备耕生产。很多社、队都根据当地情况，开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，广大贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器，进一步批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”、“桃园经验”等修正主义黑货，更加坚定了广大社员走社会主义道路的决心，进一步树立了为革命种田的思想，使备耕工作出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新局面。在豫北、豫西棉区和豫东平原，积肥送肥人群不断，春播土地正在翻耕，农田小型水利工程正在加紧兴修，调换良种和春季育苗等工作已经开始。入春以来，全省许多地区加强了麦田管理，开展了追肥、灌水、中耕活动，当前麦苗一片碧绿，长势普遍良好。

    据新华社长春十六日电　吉林省农村广大贫下中农和基层干部认真总结去年一年“抓革命，促生产”的经验，再接再厉，正在全面落实毛主席的最新指示，以革命统帅生产，掀起备耕生产高潮，夺取今年的农业大丰收。今年以来，各地在总结工作的基础上，普遍召开了农村工作会议或抓革命促生产的经验交流大会。广大贫下中农和农村干部深有体会地说：千依靠，万依靠，毛泽东思想是根本的依靠；千胜利，万胜利，毛泽东思想大普及，实现人的思想革命化是最大的胜利。
    从去年第四季度以来，全省农村已办了三万多期毛泽东思想学习班，共有一百二十多万人参加了学习。今年以来，广大革命群众以最大的热情、最快的速度、最高的自觉、最有效的措施，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。他们进一步开展革命的大批判，并开展了一场围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”。目前，全省已有六个地区、两个市和十多个县，以及占百分之七十的农村人民公社，实现了革命大联合。还有不少单位实现了革命三结合。全省农村革命群众从来没有象现在这样精神焕发，革命和生产的积极性从来没有象现在这样高涨。今年的备耕生产抓得早，群众干劲足。全省二十多处重点水利工程搞得又快又好，小型农田水利已经完成土方二千多万立方米。积肥六千多万吨，质量好于往年，其中已送到田的占三分之一，进度比往年快。工交、财贸战线上的革命职工，也正在从各方面大力支援农业生产，积极为今年农业的更大丰收贡献力量。
