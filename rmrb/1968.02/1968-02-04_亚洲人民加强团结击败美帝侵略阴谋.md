A U.S. Navy warship brazenly entered Cambodian territorial waters at the beginning of last month, deliberately provoking a conflict. On January 27, the Royal Government of Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest against this pirate-like behavior by U.S. imperialism to the U.S. government. The Chinese people fully support the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Cambodian people in their just stance of defending their territorial sovereignty.

U.S. imperialism repeatedly claims to "guarantee respect for Cambodian sovereignty, neutrality, and territorial integrity." However, it has ignored the Royal Government of Cambodia's repeated stern warnings and has repeatedly violated Cambodian territory and territorial waters, threatening and provoking the Cambodian people with war. U.S. imperialism's aggressive actions show that it is the number one enemy of the Cambodian people.

The Johnson administration, while continuing to plot the expansion of the war in Vietnam, is also intensifying its aggressive and war activities in Korea, Cambodia, and other parts of Asia, creating tense situations, all for its nefarious purposes. It not only seeks to reverse its losing position in the Vietnam War, mobilize the country for war, and create excuses to call up reservists and extend the service terms of active-duty personnel, but also aims to shift domestic public attention, improve the Democratic Party's unfavorable position before the U.S. elections, and alleviate the unprecedented severe economic crisis facing the U.S. through further military buildup and war preparations. Recently, the U.S. propaganda machine has repeatedly hinted that Johnson is preparing to take some "special measures" to deal with the so-called "Asian crisis," and has pointed out that Johnson's call-up of reservists is the "first step" in the U.S.'s overall war preparations and expansion of the Vietnam War plan. All signs indicate that the U.S. imperialism, beset by internal and external troubles, is determined to make a desperate struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Our common enemy is U.S. imperialism. We are all on the same front. We need to unite and support each other."

At this time, when U.S. imperialism is intensifying its aggressive and war activities in Asia, the Asian peoples must strengthen their unity, support each other, and wage a resolute struggle to defeat this vicious common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

The heroic Vietnamese people are at the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle, waging a fierce and unyielding battle against the U.S. aggressors and achieving great victories. Recently, the South Vietnamese people have launched a comprehensive offensive against the U.S. aggressors with overwhelming force, achieving extremely glorious results. This unprecedented victory in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression is the biggest blow and the biggest restraint on U.S. imperialism; it is also the biggest support and encouragement for the anti-U.S. struggle of the peoples of various Asian countries. Similarly, the anti-U.S. struggles of the peoples of various Asian countries have dealt heavy blows to U.S. imperialism and are a powerful support and cooperation for the Vietnamese people.

Currently, the situation of the world peoples' anti-U.S. struggle is very favorable. As long as the Asian peoples strengthen their unity, further consolidate and develop the anti-U.S. united front, and jointly wage an unyielding struggle against U.S. imperialism, they will definitely be able to smash U.S. imperialism's aggressive and war plots in Asia and drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia.

U.S. imperialism is doomed to fail, and the Asian peoples are sure to win!

    亚洲人民加强团结击败美帝侵略阴谋
    本报评论员
    美国海军的一艘军舰，上月初悍然开进柬埔寨领海，蓄意寻衅。柬埔寨王国政府外交部一月二十七日对美帝国主义的这种海盗行为，向美国政府提出了强烈抗议。中国人民完全支持柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民维护领土主权的正义立场。
    美帝国主义口口声声说“保证尊重柬埔寨主权、中立和领土完整”。但是，它不顾柬埔寨王国政府多次的严正警告，接连侵犯柬埔寨的领土、领海，对柬埔寨人民进行战争威胁和军事挑衅。美帝国主义的这种侵略行动表明，它是柬埔寨人民的头号敌人。
    约翰逊政府最近在继续策划扩大侵越战争的同时，竭力在朝鲜、柬埔寨和亚洲其它地区加紧侵略和战争活动，制造紧张局势，是有其不可告人的罪恶目的的。它不仅妄想借以挽救在侵越战争中的败局，在国内进行战争动员，为征召预备役人员和延长现役人员服役期限制造借口，而且力图借此转移国内人民视线，改善民主党政府在美国大选前夕的不利处境，同时还想通过进一步加紧扩军备战来缓和美国面临的空前严重的经济危机。美国宣传机器近日来不断透露，约翰逊准备采取一些应付所谓“亚洲危机”的“特别措施”，并且指出，约翰逊征召预备役人员是美国整个备战和扩大侵越战争计划的“第一步”。种种迹象表明，内外交困的美帝国主义一心一意要进行疯狂的挣扎。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“我们共同的敌人是美帝国主义，我们大家都是站在一条战线上，大家需要互相团结互相支持。”
    在目前美帝国主义加紧在亚洲进行侵略和战争活动的时候，亚洲人民必须加强团结，互相支持，进行坚决的斗争，来打败美帝国主义这个凶恶的共同敌人。
    英雄的越南人民站在反美斗争的最前线，正在同美国侵略者进行着艰苦卓绝的战斗，并且不断取得巨大的胜利。最近，南越人民以排山倒海之势，向美国侵略者发动全面袭击，取得了极其辉煌的战果。越南人民抗美救国战争的这一空前胜利，是对美帝国主义最大的打击，最大的牵制；也是对亚洲各国人民反美斗争的最大的支持，最大的鼓舞。同样，亚洲各国人民的反美斗争，给了美帝国主义以沉重的打击，也是对越南人民的一种有力的支持和配合。
    目前，世界人民反美斗争形势一片大好。亚洲人民只要加强团结，进一步巩固和发展反美统一战线，共同对美帝国主义进行坚持不懈的斗争，就一定能够粉碎美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略和战争阴谋，把美帝国主义从亚洲赶出去。
    美帝国主义必败，亚洲人民必胜！
