Rural residents are scattered, making it inconvenient for the masses to gather for study. How to conduct good study classes? The experience of Tenli Ping Brigade is to hold “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Classes.”

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in Wangqing County, Jilin Province, enthusiastically assisted Tenli Ping Brigade and production teams in setting up study classes. However, the members of this brigade live in scattered residences, and some elderly people and women with many children cannot participate in the study. For example, the third production team has twenty-three households with one hundred and thirteen people. When the production team organizes study sessions, only about twenty people can participate. Team leader Yang Baohe and study guide Zhang Shufen discussed the issue and decided to first combine two households to help the elderly and women study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations. They consciously engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, becoming more enthusiastic about learning. Everyone called this form of study class a “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Class.”

The Propaganda Team saw that this form of study class was suitable for members living in scattered residences, so they actively and enthusiastically supported it. Soon, the entire brigade universally established “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Classes,” which quickly spread to the entire commune.

The Propaganda Team and brigade cadres jointly summarized the initial experience of the “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Classes” and decided that cadres should take the lead, divide into sections, take responsibility, and specifically help. They selected comrades who cared about state affairs, studied Chairman Mao's works well, had a certain level of education, and had organizational abilities to serve as study guides for the “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Classes.” They required the guides to adhere to eight words: follow closely, grasp accurately, lead by example, and be flexible. That is, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely; grasp the active thoughts of the class members accurately; lead by example in practicing and applying Chairman Mao's works; and be flexible in managing the study classes, not too rigid. In this way, not only can the “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Classes” be sustained, but it also cultivates a batch of Mao Zedong Thought propagandists. Currently, the entire brigade has cultivated thirty-two study guides.

This “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Class” has several advantages:

1. Everyone can participate, and everyone is educated. Except for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, all members, cadres, men, women, old, and young participate in the study.

2. It is beneficial for mutual help and learning, promoting common progress. The “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Classes” often adopt methods such as youth speaking, children singing, women studying, and the elderly recalling, mutually inspiring, learning from each other's strengths, and compensating for weaknesses. The forms are lively, and participation is widespread.

3. It is convenient to study at any time, with ample time. Students can come and go as needed, with study opportunities at any time and place.

4. The “Three-Household, Two-Household Study Classes” and the team-organized study classes complement each other, making it a good form to popularize Mao Zedong Thought.

Currently, Tenli Ping Brigade is experiencing a new high tide of studying, reciting, and singing the "Three Articles," with fathers and sons, husbands and wives, and mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law all studying Chairman Mao's works together.

    农村居住分散，群众集中学习很不方便，怎样办好学习班？十里坪大队的经验是：
    办“三家两户学习班”
    驻吉林汪清县的人民解放军某部的毛泽东思想宣传队，热情协助十里坪大队和生产队办起了学习班。但是这里的社员居住分散，有些老年人和孩子多的妇女，不能参加学习。如第三生产队共二十三户人家，一百一十三口人，队里组织学习，只有二十多人能参加。生产队长杨宝和就和学习辅导员张淑芬研究，先把两家凑在一起，帮助老人、妇女学习“老三篇”和毛主席语录。他们自觉地斗私批修，越学越起劲。大家把这种形式的学习班叫作是“三家两户学习班”。
    宣传队看到这种形式的学习班适合居住分散的社员学习，就积极热情地支持。不久，全大队普遍办起了“三家两户学习班”，并很快推广到全公社。
    宣传队和大队干部又共同总结了这种“三家两户学习班”的初步经验，决定干部带头，分片包干，具体帮助，由群众推选出关心国家大事、学习毛主席著作较好、有一定文化水平和组织能力的同志，担任“三家两户学习班”的辅导员。要求辅导员作到八个字：紧跟、抓准、带头、灵活。即：紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；抓准本班学员的活思想；带头在实践中活学活用毛主席著作；对学习班的学习，要灵活掌握，不要太死板。这样，不仅能够使“三家两户学习班”持久地办下去，同时也培养了一批毛泽东思想宣传员。目前全大队已培养了三十二名学习辅导员。
    这种“三家两户学习班”有几个好处：
    一、人人能参加，个个受教育。除地、富、反、坏、右分子外，社员、干部、男女老少都参加学习。
    二、有利于互帮互学，共同提高。“三家两户学习班”经常采取青年讲，儿童唱，妇女学，老人忆的方法，互相启发，取长补短，形式活泼，发言普遍。
    三、见缝插针，时间充足，学习方便，学员随叫随到，随时随地都有学习机会。
    四、“三家两户学习班”和队办的学习班相辅相成，是普及毛泽东思想的好形式。
    目前，十里坪大队大学、大背、大唱“老三篇”蔚然成风，出现了父子同学，夫妻同学，婆媳同学毛主席著作的新高潮。
