The whistle for starting work has just blown,
By the square, the red book gleams in the morning sun!
The commune members study the quotations before work,
Consulting the red sun in our hearts!

The rough voices echo through the valleys,
From mountain to mountain, the sound resonates,
Chairman Mao guides our path,
His teachings are deeply remembered!

With clear minds and bright eyes, we work with great enthusiasm,
We can cross three ridges in one breath,
Baskets weave through the air as we hurry to carry fertilizer,
Sweat pours, melting the frost across the land!

Each basket of fertilizer brings a song,
The valleys and streams sing in harmony:
“In the East, the red sun rises…”
“Chairman Mao’s works shine with golden light!”

The enthusiasm surges in the villages of the Forty-Nines,
The villagers work with great vigor,
Who says the winter in the deep mountains is long?
The mountains are turning green, spreading spring light!

  满山抽绿铺春光
  向阳
  上工的哨子刚刚响，
  广场边，红色宝书映朝阳！
  社员工前学语录，
  请示咱心中的红太阳！
  粗犷的书声震山谷，
  山山岭岭起回响，
  毛主席给咱来指路，
  谆谆教导记心上！
  心明眼亮啊干劲强，
  一口气能翻三道梁，
  背篓穿梭运肥急，
  热汗流，融尽山野遍地霜！
  一篓篓肥料一篓篓歌，
  山谷溪水和声唱：
  “东方红，太阳升……”
  “毛主席著作闪金光”！
  四九山村热潮涌，
  山村人民干劲旺，
  谁说深山冬日久，
  满山抽绿铺春光！
