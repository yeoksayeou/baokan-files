Pakistani public opinion has exposed the conspiracy of the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists to support Indian expansion and aggression. They strongly condemn the Soviet revisionists for providing military aid to India, which threatens Pakistan's security. Foreign Minister Pirzada has stated that the Pakistani government will take necessary measures to ensure its own security.

New Delhi, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) — Pakistani Foreign Minister Pirzada said in a statement in Karachi that the Soviet Union's provision of more than 100 SU-7 supersonic jet fighter-bombers and other modern military equipment to India "has caused widespread concern in Pakistan." He said, "It is well known that India has been rapidly expanding its military arsenal by purchasing weapons from abroad and increasing domestic production."

He said, "Pakistan will continue to be vigilant about its own security. The government will take any measures it deems necessary."

Pakistani public opinion continues to strongly condemn the Soviet revisionists for providing military aid to India, thereby threatening Pakistan's security.

The Lahore-based "Pakistan Times" recently published a series of long articles exposing the fact that over the past two years, the Soviet revisionist clique has continuously provided large amounts of military aid to the Indian reactionaries.

The article states: During Soviet Premier Kosygin's visit to India, "he sat with Indira Gandhi on the reviewing stand to watch the Indian armed forces' parade. For the first time, some of the weapons inspected included the latest Soviet weapons, which were either obtained from Moscow or produced with Russian help."

The article points out: Various evidence shows that over the past two years, the Soviet Union has, according to new agreements signed with India, continuously provided large amounts of military aid to India. The latest example of this is the Soviet Union's provision of 150 SU-7 supersonic jet fighter-bombers. A new batch of Soviet weapons includes more than 100 of the latest Soviet tanks and 150mm cannons, as well as more surface-to-air missiles. The Soviet Union is also providing patrol boats and four submarines, the first of which will be delivered next month. It is clear that the Soviet Union has become the most important supplier of India's defense needs.

In exposing the despicable conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to jointly oppose China, the article says: "In the past two years, the politics of the great powers have been full of twists and turns. Their unchanging goal has been to maintain the status quo to mend Indo-Pakistani relations, and then to sever Pakistan's relations with the People's Republic of China." The article points out: Pakistan's relations with China are friendly. The Chinese people sympathize with all the peoples of newly independent countries who have suffered from colonialism and believe that Pakistan's stance on India and Kashmir is just. They are willing to support this stance with practical actions.

The article continues: Pakistan must always be vigilant against the political and diplomatic conspiracies of the superpowers. "If anyone tries to force us to choose between them and China, the main interests of our country require us to maintain contact with the People's Republic of China."

The Lahore-based "New Age" newspaper said in an editorial on February 8: "The Soviet Union's provision of modern weapons to India clearly shows that in its relations with Pakistan, the Soviet Union's attitude is no different from that of the Western imperialist countries, and it is not one bit better." The editorial said that Western imperialism is using India as a tool to realize its imperialist plots in this region, and now the Soviet Union is also taking this path. The editorial then emphasized: "The Pakistani people have reason to say: The Soviet Union has joined Western imperialism in supporting India's expansionist and aggressive plots."

The Karachi-based "Morning News" published an editorial on February 8 stating that Soviet military aid to India "is a serious threat to the security of Pakistan and other small countries in this region, as well as to the peace of the entire region."

According to a Xinhua report from Rawalpindi on the 16th, a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said on the 15th: The Pakistani government has already lodged a protest with the Soviet government regarding the Soviet Union's provision of SU-7 supersonic fighter-bombers to India.

Chairman Abdul Hamid Khan of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government issued a statement to the press on the 15th. The statement pointed out: The recent military aid provided by the Soviet Union to India has encouraged the Indian ruling clique's expansionist adventurism, especially its suppression of the Kashmir people's struggle for self-determination. However, no amount of military force can make India permanently occupy Kashmir, because the wisdom and strength of the people fighting against oppression and rule will ultimately win victory. The struggle of the Vietnamese people has proven this.

    巴基斯坦舆论揭露苏修伙同美帝支持印度扩张和侵略阴谋
    强烈谴责苏修向印度提供军援威胁巴安全
    皮尔扎达外长声明强调巴政府将采取必要措施保证自己的安全
    新华社拉合尔电　巴基斯坦外交部长皮尔扎达十日在卡拉奇发表声明指出，苏联向印度提供一百多架SU—7型超音速喷气战斗轰炸机和其他现代化军事装备，“已经在巴基斯坦引起普遍的关切”。他说：“印度一直在以狂热的速度，通过从国外购买军火和增加国内的生产能力来扩充军备，这已经是众所周知的事情。”
    他说：“巴基斯坦将继续并永远对自己的安全保持警惕。政府将采取它认为必要的任何措施。”
    巴基斯坦公众舆论继续强烈谴责苏修向印度提供军事援助，从而威胁巴基斯坦的安全。
    在拉合尔出版的《巴基斯坦时报》最近连续刊登了长篇文章，揭露两年来苏修集团源源不断地向印度反动派提供大量军事援助的事实。
    文章说：苏联总理柯西金访问印度时，“他在印度共和国日同英迪拉·甘地同坐在检阅台上，观看印度武装力量的分列式。第一次列入受检阅的武器中有一些苏联最新式的武器，这些武器不是印度从莫斯科得到的，就是在俄国的帮助下自己制造的。”
    文章指出：各种证据表明，苏联两年来根据同印度新签订的协定，把大量的军事援助源源不断地输入印度。这方面的最新实例是，苏联提供了一百五十架SU—7型超音速喷气战斗轰炸机，新的一批苏联武器包括一百多辆最新式的苏联坦克和一百五十毫米大炮以及更多的地对空导弹。苏联还在提供巡逻艇和四艘潜艇，第一艘将于下月提交。显然，苏联迄今已经成为印度防御需要的最最重要的供应者。
    文章在揭露美帝苏修联合反华的卑鄙阴谋时说：“在过去的两年里，大国的政治出现了许多迂回曲折。他们的一个始终不变的目的，是在维持现状的基础上弥补印巴关系，然后使巴基斯坦同中华人民共和国断绝关系。”文章指出：巴基斯坦同中国的关系是友好的。中国人民同情一切受过殖民主义损害的新独立的国家的人民，并且认为巴基斯坦对印度和克什米尔的立场是正义的，他们表示愿意以实际行动支持这一立场。
    文章接着说：巴基斯坦必须对超级大国的政治和外交阴谋始终保持警惕。“如果有谁要强迫我们在他们同中国之间作出选择的话，我们国家的主要利益要求我们同中华人民共和国保持联系。”
    拉合尔的《新时代报》二月八日在社论中指出：“苏联向印度提供现代化武器的做法清楚地表明，在同巴基斯坦的关系上，苏联的态度和西方帝国主义国家的态度一点也没有什么不同，一点也不比它们好一点。”社论说，西方帝国主义正在把印度作为它们在这个地区实现其帝国主义阴谋的工具，现在，苏联也走上了这条路。社论接着强调指出：“巴基斯坦人民有理由这样说：苏联已经同西方帝国主义合伙支持印度的扩张和侵略阴谋。”
    卡拉奇的《晨报》八日发表社论说，苏联对印度的军事援助，“是对巴基斯坦和这一地区其他小国的安全以及对这一整个地区的和平的严重威胁。”
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第十六日电　巴基斯坦外交部发言人十五日说：巴基斯坦政府已就苏联向印度提供SU—7型超音速战斗轰炸机这件事向苏联政府交涉。
    查谟和克什米尔自由政府主席阿卜杜勒·哈米德汗十五日向报界发表声明。声明指出：最近苏联向印度提供的武器援助，怂恿了印度统治集团的扩张冒险，特别是怂恿了它镇压克什米尔人民争取自决权的斗争。但是，不论多大的军事力量都不能使印度永远占领克什米尔，因为为抗击压迫和统治而斗争的人民的智慧和力量，终将赢得胜利。越南人民的斗争已经证明了这一点。
