The heroic armed forces of the Vietnamese South, riding the east wind and raising the red flag, launched a second major offensive against more than thirty important cities and bases of the U.S. and puppet forces in the early hours of February 18, delivering another thunderous and devastating blow to the shaken U.S. and puppet clique.

This is the second unstoppable and powerful offensive launched by the heroic military and people of the Vietnamese South in the past twenty days. In this offensive, they fought bravely, fearlessly sacrificing themselves, enduring fatigue, and fighting continuously, striking hard, accurately, and fiercely. The targets of their attacks covered the vast battlefield of South Vietnam. These included: the city of Saigon and its surrounding important U.S. military bases and strongholds such as New Mountain One, Bien Hoa, Long Binh, Tay Ninh, Lai Thi, Go Vap, and Bien Cat; the western suburbs of Saigon and the Mekong Delta's Chuong Thien, Ben Tre, My Tho, My Tho, Soc Trang, Di An, Vung Tau, Cai Lay, and Cao Lanh; the central cities of Phan Rang, Kontum, and Da Lat, and the U.S. base at Phu Bai south of the demilitarized zone. The Associated Press exclaimed: "This attack was coordinated, and its accuracy was almost identical to the fierce attacks on January 30 and 31."

In Saigon and its surroundings, the thunderous cannon fire of the people's liberation forces struck fear into the hearts of the enemy. The fierce artillery of the people's liberation forces caused severe damage to the important U.S. base at New Mountain One and Bien Hoa. Several U.S. planes on the runway at New Mountain One were hit and exploded. Shells even reached the headquarters of the U.S. commander in Vietnam, General Westmoreland, sending the U.S. invaders into a panic. The important U.S. supply base at Long Binh near Saigon, the U.S. naval base at Tay Ninh, and the headquarters of the U.S. 25th Division at Go Vap were all subjected to fierce attacks. The ammunition depot at Long Binh was hit and exploded. At the same time, the people's liberation forces also attacked the puppet police headquarters and other targets in Saigon, causing explosions that shook the buildings in the bustling city center. At this moment, the U.S. "ambassador" to Saigon, Bunker, who was terrified by the surprise attack of the people's liberation forces, immediately fled from his residence to a so-called secret "safe place."

The new widespread and fierce attacks launched by the people's liberation forces in various places in the Mekong Delta left the enemy breathless and plunged them into new chaos. When attacking some important cities in the central region, the people's liberation forces fought swiftly and fiercely. In Phan Rang, the capital of Phu Yen Province, they launched a fierce assault and controlled one-fifth of the entire city, and opened the enemy's prison, releasing more than five hundred patriotic compatriots who had been imprisoned by the enemy.

In the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region south of the demilitarized zone, the people's liberation forces launched another fierce bombardment of the U.S. base at Phu Bai in the early hours of February 18, and continued to fiercely attack the enemy in the Khe Sanh front and the heroic city of Hue.

The brave and tenacious military and people of Hue have been fighting continuously for nearly twenty days. They not only repelled the enemy's repeated counterattacks but also tied down many enemy troops in this region, continuously annihilating the enemy's fighting forces. On February 15 and 16, the military and people of Hue foiled the enemy's multiple counterattacks, annihilating 450 U.S. and puppet soldiers, and destroying or damaging many armored vehicles. On February 17, they sank or damaged six U.S. landing craft on the Perfume River.

The military and people of Hue showed extraordinary bravery and tenacity in the battle. Despite the enemy's daily aerial, artillery, and armored vehicle-supported counterattacks, all were repelled. They fought the enemy for every inch of land, every house, and every street corner under the thick smoke of gunpowder. When the enemy launched counterattacks, many soldiers bravely charged into the enemy ranks, engaging in close combat. Some soldiers stabbed four or five enemies in one breath. Various assault teams worked closely together, concentrating firepower to annihilate the enemy wave after wave. The soldiers responsible for anti-aircraft defense fired fiercely, preventing American aggressor planes from approaching or flying at low altitudes, creating conditions for the assault team members to charge and fight. The military and people of Hue firmly defended their positions, bravely repelling the enemy's dozens of counterattacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The streets of Hue were littered with enemy corpses, and even the commander of the U.S. Marine Corps' 5th Regiment had to admit dejectedly that his "Marine Corps had suffered considerable losses."

    英勇战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳，连续作战，沉重打击惊魂未定的敌人
    越南南方军民向美伪军发动第二次强大攻势
    攻打目标遍及南越广阔战场，猛烈袭击三十多个美伪重要城镇和基地，炮弹一直打到侵越美军司令的总部，打得敌人闻声丧胆，抱头鼠窜，陷于新的混乱中
    新华社河内十八日电　英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量乘东风展红旗，十八日凌晨又对三十多个美伪重要城镇和基地发动第二次强大攻势，给了惊魂未定的美伪集团又一次雷霆万钧般的沉重打击。
    这是最近二十天内，英雄的越南南方军民英勇战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳，连续作战，向美伪军发动的第二次锐不可挡的强大攻势。在这次攻势中，他们同样打得猛、准、狠。袭击的目标遍及南越广阔战场。其中包括：西贡市和西贡周围的新山一、边和、龙平、芽?、莱溪、古芝、边葛等美军重要基地和据点；西贡西北的西宁和湄公河三角洲的朱笃、槟椥、芹苴、美萩、朔庄、迪石、永隆、丐礼、高岭等重要城镇和基地；中部的藩切、昆嵩、大叻等重要城市和非军事区以南的芙拜美军基地。美联社惊呼：“这次攻击是协调一致的，它的准确性同一月三十日和三十一日的猛烈攻势几乎完全一样。”
    在西贡和西贡周围，人民解放武装力量进攻的隆隆炮声，使得敌人闻声胆寒。人民解放武装力量的猛烈炮火使美国的重要基地新山一和边和遭到严重损失，新山一机场跑道上的一些美机被击中起火爆炸。炮弹还打到了侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰的总部，打得美国侵略军抱头鼠窜。西贡附近的龙平美军重要补给基地、芽?的美国海军基地和古芝的美国第二十五师总部都遭到猛烈的袭击，龙平基地的弹药库被击中起火爆炸。与此同时，人民解放武装力量还袭击了西贡市的伪警察总部和其他目标，爆炸声震动了西贡闹市区的建筑物。这时，被人民解放武装力量的奇袭吓破了胆的美国驻西贡“大使”邦克，立即从他的住所逃之夭夭，藏到一个所谓保密的“保护地点”去了。
    人民解放武装力量在湄公河三角洲各地发动的新的广泛而猛烈的袭击，使敌人无法喘息，又陷入新的混乱中。在袭击中部一些重要城镇时，人民解放武装力量打得非常迅猛，在平顺省省会藩切市，他们一阵猛打猛冲，就控制了全城的五分之一，并且打开了敌人的监狱，救出了五百多名被敌人监禁的爱国同胞。
    在非军事区以南的广治—承天地区，人民解放武装力量十八日凌晨又一次猛轰芙拜美军基地，同时在溪山前线和英雄的城市顺化继续痛击敌人。
    英勇顽强的顺化市军民，已连续奋战近二十天，他们不仅打退了敌人的一次又一次反扑，而且把美伪军的许多军队牵制在这个地区，不断歼灭敌军的有生力量。十五日和十六日两天，顺化军民又粉碎了敌人的多次反扑，消灭美伪军四百五十名，击毁击伤装甲车多辆。十七日，他们在香江上击沉、击伤美军登陆艇六艘。
    顺化军民在战斗中表现得十分英勇顽强。尽管敌人每天在飞机、大炮和装甲车配合下连续组织多次反扑，但全都被他们打退。他们在弥漫的硝烟下，同敌人争夺每一寸土地、每一座房屋和每一个街角。当敌人进行反扑时，许多战士勇猛地冲进敌群，同敌人展开白刃战。有的战士一口气就刺死四、五个敌人。各突击组紧密配合，集中火力，一股又一股地把敌人歼灭。负责防空的战士们猛烈开火，使美国强盗飞机不敢接近或作低空飞行，为突击队员们冲锋杀敌创造了条件。顺化军民始终坚守阵地，英勇地击退了敌人的成十次反扑，使敌人付出极大的伤亡。顺化街头敌人尸横遍地，连美国海军陆战队第五团的团长也不得不垂头丧气地承认，他的“海军陆战队遭到了相当大的伤亡”。
