In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the smartest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience.

Use Mao Zedong Thought to Hold the Revolutionary Power Firmly
— Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee Strives for the Ideological Revolutionization of the Leadership Corps

The Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Municipality, with deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, insists on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, strives for ideological revolutionization, ensures that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are fully implemented at all levels, and works hard to firmly hold the revolutionary power.

At present, the revolutionary and production situation in this county is excellent. The revolutionary criticism and repudiation is developing in depth, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are set up everywhere, and more than half of the county's 270,000 people are participating in the study. The county has fully achieved revolutionary great unity, and on the basis of the revolutionary three-in-one combination, has basically established and improved the rural grassroots leadership corps. Winter management of wheat and spring plowing preparations are better than any previous year.

Ideological revolutionization of the leadership corps is a top priority in firmly holding the proletarian dictatorship

In September last year, after the stormy test of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee was formally established on the basis of achieving revolutionary great unity. This was the first county revolutionary committee established in Beijing Municipality. At that time, most members of the county revolutionary committee could correctly handle the work of this new revolutionary power. Everyone just felt that there were countless tasks, but what should be grasped? They were momentarily at a loss. Some comrades thought that since results had been achieved, they could relax. Some, after becoming committee members, showed signs of alienation from the masses. Some felt that the responsibility of a committee member was heavy and could not be shouldered.

In response to these active thoughts, the county revolutionary committee organized all committee members to study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Through study, everyone realized that the establishment of the revolutionary committee was only the first step of a long march, and the tasks ahead were more arduous. They could not be satisfied with the achievements already made and should strive for greater victories. After becoming committee members, they should wholeheartedly serve the people and never alienate themselves from the masses. Alienation from the masses would be like bean sprouts in a dish, unable to bloom or bear fruit.

Everyone deeply felt during the study that the root cause of the erroneous thoughts mentioned above was the failure to use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and the failure to achieve ideological revolutionization. Everyone believed that using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and achieving ideological revolutionization of the people was the way to firmly hold the revolutionary power. Without using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, feudal, capitalist, and revisionist thoughts would be used as the guiding principle, and the revolutionary power would change color.

The county revolutionary committee, based on the opinions of all members, made a resolution on achieving ideological revolutionization. They decided to use their own ideological revolutionization to promote the ideological revolutionization of all cadres and the people of the entire county.

Actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental way to achieve ideological revolutionization

To achieve ideological revolutionization, one must arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Members of the county revolutionary committee, with deep affection for Chairman Mao, would immediately gather to study, discuss, and deeply understand whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued. They believed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were the action guidelines for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country. Those understood should be executed, and those not yet understood should also be executed, with understanding deepening in the process of execution. However, as members of the county revolutionary committee, they must first deeply understand in order to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the county and guide the 270,000 people of the county onto the track of Mao Zedong Thought. Only with a deep understanding can implementation be good.

In studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, everyone would reveal their own thoughts, exchange experiences, help each other, and inspire each other to jointly improve. "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." After this latest instruction from Chairman Mao was transmitted, everyone immediately studied it. A comrade said, "If we unite like this, who is the revolutionary rebel faction would be unclear." Everyone then discussed together and further realized that one should not think that only oneself is a revolutionary rebel faction and others are not. Those who made mistakes mostly had issues of understanding; even if it was an issue of stance, it could be changed. If one stands in the wrong queue, one can stand over. Why shouldn't we unite?

This comrade, through the help of everyone, quickly understood and took active action to implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction.

In addition to concentrated study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, members of the county revolutionary committee also dispersed to various groups for study. They established a "daily reading" system, one hour each day, without fail. If someone came during this time, they would also ask them to study in the transmission room. If someone came to the office, they would say, "Please come to study with us!"

Of course, not all of Chairman Mao's latest instructions were fully understood at the time and must be studied repeatedly in conjunction with actual conditions. When encountering problems in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they would study and practice together with the masses to jointly understand.

Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly, comprehensively, and layer by layer is a great loyalty and integrity to the revolution

Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is the fundamental aspect of ideological revolutionization. With this foundation, one can act decisively, seize the day, fear no difficulties, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with a revolutionary style.

When the latest instructions from Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China were transmitted to Pinggu County, the county revolutionary committee immediately took action, convened a meeting, and studied and deeply understood the instructions. The meeting decided to quickly transmit Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the county. At that time, despite the heavy rain and muddy ground, they did not hesitate and transmitted the instructions layer by layer through the night. Within one day, the county organized 2,700 propaganda teams to spread Chairman Mao's great voice to every corner of the county. The Bear Ear Village Commune's North Drip Water Production Brigade, with only four households, is located in a high mountain area. This time, they also timely heard Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the community members said emotionally, "The county revolutionary committee brought us Chairman Mao's voice, truly the people's heart."

With a loyal heart, in any situation, there should be no discounting the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. On October 1st last year, Vice Chairman Lin transmitted Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," calling for the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to turn the entire country into a school of Mao Zedong Thought. The Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee immediately held a discussion. At that time, it was the busy season in the countryside, and some thought that if study classes were established throughout the county, the leadership would not be able to manage, and they could first establish them in the organs. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" was the latest instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao and must be quickly implemented. Establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes was the best form of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. As long as the mass line was adhered to and the masses were fully mobilized, any difficulty could be overcome. They decided to mobilize the masses to widely establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with the county revolutionary committee, communes, production brigades, and production teams all establishing them. A mass movement to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism and actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought quickly and vigorously unfolded throughout the county.

Not only should Chairman Mao's latest instructions be implemented in the leadership corps of the county revolutionary committee, but they should also be implemented layer by layer in the leadership corps of communes and production brigades. Only in this way can Chairman Mao's latest instructions be turned into the actual actions of the masses. The county revolutionary committee, based on this guiding ideology, often educated the grassroots leadership corps in rural areas to strive for ideological revolutionization. Under the guidance of the county revolutionary committee, after the Wangxin Village Commune established the revolutionary committee, they grasped the fundamentals among countless tasks. They first spent four days discussing how to achieve ideological revolutionization and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots and among the masses. Various production brigades and production teams also placed ideological revolutionization first.

Being both an "official" and a common person, forever being with the masses, is the key to transforming the style of the leadership corps

Chairman Mao said, "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the smartest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." The Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instruction, taking close contact with the masses as an important content of achieving ideological revolutionization.

Members of the county revolutionary committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "be both an 'official' and a common person," went deep into the grassroots and stayed with the masses, becoming both officials and citizens. They believed that being an official was to lead, to lead according to Mao Zedong Thought, to lead according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to concentrate from the masses and persist in the masses. This leadership was not official leadership. Only by being both an official and a citizen could this leadership be embodied. In the county revolutionary committee, leaders of revolutionary mass organizations took turns on duty and could often be in the grassroots with the masses. Other leaders and committee members could also often go deep into the grassroots and eat, live, work, study, and fight with the masses.

To maintain contact with the masses, one must timely do political and ideological work and prevent any signs of alienation from the masses. There was a committee member who was a leader of a revolutionary mass organization. After coming to the revolutionary committee, he became estranged from the worker masses of his original unit and participated less in labor. During the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the responsible person of the county revolutionary committee helped him fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, making him realize that no matter what cadre, one must often go to the masses. If one is alienated from the masses, one cannot reflect the voice of the masses. Originally smart would become confused; originally talented would lose talent. This comrade understood the spirit of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly transformed, participated in the labor, work, and study of the original unit, and helped grassroots cadres implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Use Mao Zedong Thought to continuously fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, and forever maintain the revolutionary nature of the proletariat

Achieving ideological revolutionization is a long-term process and requires continuous struggle against the "self" in one's mind and the establishment of "public" spirit. This is the deep understanding of the Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee. They followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, took "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, regularly held democratic life meetings, actively carried out criticism and self-criticism, thereby strengthening the unity of the leadership core and exerting greater combat effectiveness. At the same time, they also fought selfishness and criticized revisionism with the masses and consciously accepted the criticism and supervision of the masses.

In the county revolutionary committee, there were revolutionary leading cadres who were older and younger revolutionary youngsters. During meetings, a young comrade, because of less work experience, rarely spoke. Some comrades blamed him for not using his brain. After the responsible person of the county revolutionary committee discovered this problem, they actively checked themselves for not helping the young comrades well and not further mobilizing their enthusiasm. He said, I always thought I had experience, and when I saw some problems researched for half a day, it was still my idea, and I did not further mobilize everyone to discuss. This is the idea of not believing in the masses at work. Revolutionary leading cadres took the lead in checking, and the youngsters could not hold back and also eagerly revealed their selfishness and fought against it. That young comrade also checked his dependent thoughts, thinking that treating himself as a decoration was wrong, and decided to correct it.

After becoming a committee member, should one continue to carry forward the revolutionary and hardworking style of the proletariat, or should one think that the revolution has reached its end and can be special? The county revolutionary committee timely reminded everyone to seriously treat this issue: to revolutionize, not to specialize. Specializing in living style is not a small matter but a big matter related to ideological revolutionization. Therefore, they never relaxed on issues of living style. The leader of the revolutionary mass organization, Li Shulin, after becoming the deputy head of the county revolutionary committee, was allocated a single-person room by the organization. After moving in, he felt that he could no longer be with the masses to chat like before and became more and more uneasy. How could a responsible person be alienated from the masses? He thought that living in a single-person room was a small matter, but changing color was a big matter. Doing revolution could not be special, and one must maintain a simple and frugal style. He fiercely fought against the "self" in his mind and then moved out of the single-person room, living with the masses again.

Going to the masses to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism and accepting the supervision of the masses is beneficial to promoting ideological revolutionization. A responsible comrade of the county revolutionary committee standing committee and the revolutionary rebel faction of the county direct organs had estrangement with some masses. He seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively went to the masses to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, and sincerely checked his shortcomings and mistakes. The masses said emotionally, "It looks like a revolutionary, daring to rebel against oneself." Other members of the county revolutionary committee also often went to the masses to reveal their selfishness and fight against it, deeply touch their souls, and continuously transform themselves.

### 用毛泽东思想掌好革命政权——平谷县革命委员会狠抓领导班子思想革命化

    以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。
    用毛泽东思想掌好革命政权
    ——平谷县革命委员会狠抓领导班子思想革命化
    北京市平谷县革命委员会，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席最深厚的阶级感情，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，狠抓思想革命化，保证毛主席一系列最新指示条条落实、全面落实、层层落实，努力掌好革命政权。
    现在，这个县的革命、生产形势一片大好。革命大批判正向纵深发展，毛泽东思想学习班遍布各地，全县二十七万人中有半数以上的人参加了学习。全县全面实现了革命的大联合，在革命三结合的基础上，基本上建立和健全了农村基层领导班子。小麦冬季管理和春季备耕工作，比过去哪一年都做得好。
    领导班子思想革命化，是关系到掌好无产阶级政权的头等大事
    去年九月，经过无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨的考验，在实现革命大联合的基础上，平谷县革命委员会正式成立。这是北京市第一个成立的县革命委员会。当时，县革命委员会大多数成员，能够正确对待这个新生的革命政权的工作。大家只是感到，千头万绪，究竟抓什么？一时心里没有底。也有的同志认为，已经干出个结果来了，可以松一口气了。有的当了委员，滋长了脱离群众的苗头。有的感到，委员的担子重，当不了。
    针对这些活思想，县革命委员会组织全体委员，学习“老三篇”和毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告。经过学习，大家认识到，革命委员会的成立，只是万里长征的第一步，今后的任务更艰巨，绝不能满足于已取得的成就，应该再接再厉，争取更大的胜利。当了委员以后，应该完全彻底为人民服务，一刻也不能脱离群众。脱离群众，就同碟子里的豆芽一样，开不了花，结不了果。
    大家在学习中深深体会到：产生上面那些错误思想，根本原因是没有用毛泽东思想挂帅，没有实现思想革命化。大家认为，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，才能掌好革命政权。不用毛泽东思想挂帅，就会用封建主义思想、资本主义思想、修正主义思想挂帅，就会使革命政权改变颜色。
    县革命委员会根据全体成员的意见，作出了一个关于实现思想革命化的决议。他们决心用自己的思想革命化，来带动全体干部和全县人民的思想革命化。
    活学活用毛泽东思想，是实现思想革命化的根本途径
    要实现思想革命化，必须用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，深刻领会毛主席的最新指示。县革命委员会成员，怀着对毛主席的深情热爱，每逢毛主席最新指示下达时，总是立即集中起来学习，认真讨论，深刻领会。他们认为，毛主席的最新指示，是全党、全军、全国的行动纲领，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行中加深理解。但是，作为县革命委员会的成员，要在全县落实毛主席最新指示，把全县二十七万人民引导到毛泽东思想的轨道上来，首先自己要深刻理解。只有理解得深，才能落实得好。
    在学习毛主席最新指示中，各人都亮自己的思想，交流体会，互相帮助，互相启发，共同提高。“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的这个最新指示传下来后，大家马上学习。有个同志说：“这样联合起来，谁是革命造反派就分不清了。”大家就共同讨论，进一步认识到，不能认为只有自己是革命造反派，别人都不是。有些人犯了错误，也大多是认识问题；即使是立场问题，也是可以转变的。队站错了，可以站过来。我们有什么理由不联合起来呢？这个同志经过大家的帮助，思想很快通了，积极行动起来，去落实毛主席的这一最新指示。
    县革命委员会成员，除了集中学习毛主席最新指示以外，还分散到各个组里学。他们规定了“天天读”的学习制度，每天一小时，雷打不动。如果在这个时间内有人找，也请他在传达室里学。如果有人找到办公室来，就对他说：“请你来同我们一起学习吧！”
    当然，对于毛主席的最新指示，并不都是当时就完全领会的，必须结合实际，反复学习。在落实毛主席最新指示中碰到问题，就同群众一起学习，一起实践，共同领会。
    条条落实、全面落实、层层落实毛主席最新指示，是革命的大忠大节
    无限忠于毛主席，是思想革命化的根本。有了这个根本，就能雷厉风行，只争朝夕，不怕任何困难，以革命化的作风落实毛主席的最新指示。
    当毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的最新指示下达平谷县以后，县革命委员会闻风而动，立刻召开会议，认真学习，深刻领会。会议决定，迅速把毛主席最新指示传遍全县。当时尽管下着大雨，满地泥泞，他们毫不迟疑，连夜冒雨层层下达。一天之内，全县组织了两千七百多人的宣传队，把毛主席的伟大声音传遍了全县每一个角落。熊耳寨公社北滴水生产队，只有四户人家，地处高山峻岭。这次，他们也及时听到了毛主席的最新指示，社员感动地说：“县革命委员会送来毛主席的声音，真是咱们贫下中农的贴心人。”
    胸怀一个忠字，在任何情况下，对落实毛主席的最新指示，绝不打折扣。去年十月一日，林副主席传达了毛主席的“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，号召开办毛泽东思想学习班，把全国办成毛泽东思想大学校。平谷县革命委员会立即进行讨论。当时正值农村大忙季节，有人认为，如果全面开办学习班，领导力量照顾不过来，可以先在机关办。经过讨论，大家一致认为，“斗私，批修”是伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，必须迅速落实。开办毛泽东思想学习班，是落实毛主席最新指示的最好形式。只要走群众路线，把群众充分发动起来，什么困难都能克服。他们决定，发动群众广泛开办毛泽东思想学习班，县革命委员会办，公社办，大队办，生产队也办。一个以“斗私，批修”为纲、活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，很快在全县蓬蓬勃勃开展起来。
    不但要在县革命委员会领导班子中落实毛主席最新指示，而且要在公社、大队各级领导班子中层层落实。这样，才能把毛主席的最新指示变为群众的实际行动。县革命委员会本着这个指导思想，经常教育农村基层各级领导班子，要努力实现思想革命化。在县革命委员会的指导下，王辛庄公社成立革命委员会以后，千头万绪抓根本。他们首先用四天时间，讨论了如何实现思想革命化，把毛主席最新指示落实到基层，落实到群众。各生产大队、生产队，也都把思想革命化放在首位。
    既当“官”又当老百姓，永远同群众在一起，是领导班子转变作风的中心环节
    毛主席说：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”平谷县革命委员会坚决执行毛主席这一最新指示，把密切联系群众作为实现思想革命化的重要内容。
    县革命委员会成员，遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的最新指示，深入基层，和群众在一起，做到既是“官”又是民。他们认为，当“官”，就是要领导，要按照毛泽东思想去领导，按照毛主席最新指示去领导，从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。这种领导，绝不是官气的领导。只有既是“官”又是民，才能体现这种领导。在县革命委员会中，革命群众组织的负责人，采取轮流值班的办法，都能经常在基层同群众一起。其他负责人和委员，也能经常深入基层，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗。
    要坚持联系群众，必须及时做好政治思想工作，防止任何脱离群众的苗头产生。有一个委员，是革命群众组织的负责人。他到了革命委员会以后，就同原单位的工人群众疏远了，参加劳动也少了。在学习毛主席最新指示当中，县革命委员会负责人就帮助他斗私批修，使他认识到，不论什么干部，都要经常到群众中去。如果离开了群众，那就不能反映出群众的声音。原来聪明，就会变成糊涂；原来有才能，就会失去才能。这个同志领会了毛主席最新指示的精神，很快就转变了，参加原单位的劳动、工作和学习，并且帮助基层干部去落实毛主席的最新指示。
    用毛泽东思想不断斗私批修，永远保持无产阶级的革命本色
    实现思想革命化，是一个长期的过程，必须不断同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，大立“公”字。这是平谷县革命委员会的深刻体会。他们遵循毛主席的伟大教导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，定期召开民主生活会，积极开展批评和自我批评，从而加强了领导核心的团结，发挥更大的战斗力。同时，他们还和群众一起斗私批修，自觉地接受群众的批评和监督。
    县革命委员会中，有年纪比较大的革命领导干部，也有年青的革命小将。在开会时，有个青年同志因为工作经验少，很少发言。有的同志就埋怨他不动脑筋。县革命委员会负责人发现这个问题后，就主动检查了自己没有很好帮助青年同志，没有进一步调动他们的积极性。他说，我总以为自己有经验，看到有些问题研究了半天还是我这个意思，就不进一步发动大家讨论。这是不相信群众的思想在作怪。革命领导干部带头检查，小将憋不住了，也争着亮私斗私。那个青年同志也检查了自己的依赖思想，认为把自己当陪衬是不对的，决心改正。
    当上了委员以后，是继续发扬无产阶级艰苦奋斗的革命化作风，还是认为革命到头，可以特殊化呢？县革命委员会及时提醒大家必须严肃认真地对待这个问题：要革命化，不能特殊化。生活作风特殊化，绝不是小事，而是关系到思想革命化的大事。所以，他们从不放松生活作风上的问题。革命群众组织负责人李树林，当上县革命委员会副主任以后，组织上分配给他一个单人房间。他住进去以后，感到不能同过去一样和群众在一起谈心，越来越不安。一个负责人，怎么能够脱离群众？他认为住单人房间事小，变不变色事大。干革命不能闹特殊化，一定要保持艰苦朴素的作风。他狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，接着从单人房间搬了出来，又同群众住在一起。
    到群众中去斗私批修，接受群众的监督，有利于促进思想革命化。县革命委员会常委、县直机关革命造反派的一个负责同志，同一些群众有隔阂。他认真学习了毛主席最新指示，主动到群众中去斗私批修，诚恳地检查自己的缺点、错误。群众感动地说：“象个革命派的样子，敢革自己的命。”县革命委员会其他成员，也经常到群众中去亮私斗私，狠触灵魂，不断地改造自己。
