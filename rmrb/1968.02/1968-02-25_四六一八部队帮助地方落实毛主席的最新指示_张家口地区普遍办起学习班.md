The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." Since last winter, the 4618 Unit has actively assisted the Zhangjiakou region of Hebei Province in holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. To date, the entire region has established 74,800 Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Among the region's population of three million, 1.85 million have participated in study classes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must believe in and rely on the masses." We must mobilize the masses, "allow the masses to rise up in revolution, educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves." The 4618 Unit understands that assisting local areas in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a great ideological revolution. To carry out this revolution well, we must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and firmly believe in the masses, mobilize the masses, and launch a mass movement.

To mobilize the masses and organize them, they first focused on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are conveyed in their entirety to the broad revolutionary masses. In December of last year, this unit organized a 10,000-person Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to widely propagate the great situation of the Cultural Revolution to the broad revolutionary masses, to widely propagate the great significance of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and to widely spread the advanced experiences of advanced units. In a short period, various types of study classes sprang up like bamboo shoots after a rain throughout the region. The grasslands of the Great Wall region have scattered populations and inconvenient transportation. The units stationed there, in light of these characteristics, assisted in holding study classes primarily at the production team level, while also implementing block-level, courtyard-level, and household-level classes, allowing more community members to participate in study classes. The 104 households of the Erdaowu Brigade in Chicheng County are scattered across 49 gullies, 69 ridges, 22 natural villages, and 40 li of the Zigui Mountain. They actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, first establishing a brigade-level study class. To allow all brigade members to participate in study classes, they mobilized the masses based on the scattered population, developing multiple forms including production team-level, natural village-level, and household-level classes. Now, more than 80% of adults have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with the line of "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism," fight selfishness with red hearts and fierce spirits, and criticize revisionism deeply and thoroughly.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit stationed in Caigoupu Town, Huai'an County, in assisting the third brigade in holding study classes, closely combined "criticizing selfishness" with "criticizing revisionism." Their method is: study one quotation from Chairman Mao, link it to a specific example, criticize one fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, fight one aspect of selfishness, and eliminate one strain of revisionist poison. One community member said: "Chairman Mao called for us to organize ourselves in 1943. This was originally the bright path for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to rise up, but the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in 1962 vigorously advocated 'three freedoms and one contract.' This black wind also blew into our production brigade. I contracted 15 mu of land. Through the study class, I realized that this was falling for the trick of the Chinese Khrushchev and was also because I had selfishness. Now, I must criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminate his poison, and also launch a revolution in the depths of my soul, fiercely fight my 'selfishness.'"

    四六一八部队帮助地方落实毛主席的最新指示
    张家口地区普遍办起学习班
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”去冬以来，四六一八部队积极帮助河北省张家口地区大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，全区已办起毛泽东思想学习班七万四千八百多个（期），全区三百万人口中，有一百八十五万多人参加过学习班学习。
    毛主席教导我们：“要相信和依靠群众。”要放手发动群众，“让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己。”四六一八部队体会到：帮助地方大办毛泽东思想学习班，是一场思想大革命，要搞好这场革命，就必须遵循毛主席的伟大教导，坚定地相信群众，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。
    为了发动群众，组织群众，他们首先抓落实毛主席的最新指示，使毛主席的最新指示原原本本地和广大革命群众见面。去年十二月份，这个部队组织了万人毛泽东思想宣传队，向广大革命群众大讲无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，大讲大办毛泽东思想学习班的重大意义，广泛传播先进单位的先进经验，在很短的时间内，就使各种类型的学习班象雨后春笋般地遍及全区。坝上草原地区群众居住分散，交通又不方便。驻坝上部队针对这个特点，帮助他们坚持以生产队办学习班为基本形式，同时实行片办、院办、户办，使更多的社员都能进学习班学习。赤城县二道洼大队一百零四户人家，分散在四十九道沟、六十九道梁、二十二个片（自然村）、四十里长的嵯顶上。他们积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，首先办了个大队学习班。为了让全队社员都能够进学习班学习，又根据居住分散的特点，放手发动群众，发展到生产队办、自然村办、户办等多种形式，现在百分之八十以上的成年人都参加过毛泽东思想学习班的学习。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，广大贫下中农和革命干部以“斗私，批修”为纲，斗私斗得心红志壮，批修批得又狠又深。
    驻怀安县柴沟堡镇某部毛泽东思想宣传队，在帮助三大队办学习班中，把“斗私”与“批修”紧密结合起来。他们的做法是：学习一条毛主席语录，联系一个具体事例，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个谬论，斗掉一分私心，肃清一条修正主义的流毒。有一个社员说：“毛主席他老人家一九四三年就号召我们组织起来，这本来是我们广大贫下中农翻身的光明大道，可是中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人在一九六二年却大肆鼓吹‘三自一包’，这股黑风也刮到了我们生产大队，我包了十五亩地。经过学习班学习，我认识清了这是上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，也是因为我有私心。现在，我既要批判中国赫鲁晓夫，肃清他的流毒，也要在自己的灵魂深处爆发革命，狠斗自己的‘私’心。”
