The delegation of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam resident in the North held a press conference in Hanoi on February 2, enthusiastically hailing the brilliant victories recently achieved by the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people.

Deputy Head of the delegation Nguyen Phu Thuao said in his speech at the press conference: In the early spring days, the people and soldiers of the South, acting on the orders of the National Liberation Front, have charged forward and won unprecedented glorious victories, which have delighted friends from the five continents and thrown the American aggressors and their lackeys into panic.

Nguyen Phu Thuao said: "This is the most comprehensive and extensive offensive in a long time. This is a battle in which almost all the nests, military bases, and many other important military targets of the U.S.-puppet clique from Quang Tri to Can Tho, from the mountains, plains to various cities have been subjected to continuous and fierce attacks on an unprecedented scale and to an unprecedented degree."

Nguyen Phu Thuao stressed: The victories won by the people and soldiers of the South are victories of deep hatred against the American aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique. This is a victory of the unity of all liberation armed forces and other patriotic forces on the basis of the political program of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam.

Nguyen Phu Thuao said: The enemy is struggling desperately. Johnson and his lackeys are racking their brains to hatch new plots. But the situation of the American aggressors on the South Vietnam battlefield is more precarious than ever, the morale of the puppet army is extremely low, and many puppet army units are disintegrating.

He said: The enemy's offensive strength has not only been reduced, but their ability to cope with the liberation armed forces and the people has also been greatly weakened.

Nguyen Phu Thuao stressed: The battle of the people and soldiers of the South is raging fiercely and will continue to rage fiercely. The people and soldiers of the South are determined to carry on the spirit of continuous offensive, to fight while developing their strength, to give the enemy no breathing space, to win even greater and more glorious victories, and to push the great cause of resisting America and saving the country to complete victory.

    南越军民决心连续进攻扩大战果
    新华社河内二日电  越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团一日在河内举行记者招待会，热烈欢呼南方人民解放武装力量在最近几天里取得的辉煌胜利。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团副团长阮富帅在招待会上发表谈话说：在初春日子里，南方军民执行民族解放阵线的命令，冲上前去，夺取前所未有的最显赫的胜利，使五大洲朋友欢欣鼓舞，使美国强盗及其走狗惊慌失措。
    阮富帅说：“这是长期以来最全面和最广泛的一次进攻。这是以空前的规模和程度，对从广治到金瓯，从山区、平原到各个城市的几乎全部的美伪集团的各个巢穴、军事基地和其他许多重要军事目标发动连续和猛烈进攻的战斗。”
    阮富帅强调指出：南方军民取得的胜利是对美国强盗和阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团的高度仇恨的胜利。这是在越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领的基础上，各种解放武装力量和其他爱国力量团结一致的胜利。
    阮富帅说：敌人正在疯狂地进行挣扎。约翰逊及其走狗正在绞尽脑汁策划各种新的阴谋。但是美国强盗目前在越南南方战场上的阵势空前危困，伪军的士气极度低落，许多伪军部队正在瓦解。
    他说：敌人不仅是进攻力量已经减小，而且他们应付解放武装力量和人民的能力也已大大削弱了。
    阮富帅强调指出：南方军民的战斗正在激烈地进行，并将继续激烈地进行。南方军民决心发扬连续进攻的精神，边战斗、边发展力量，不让敌人有喘气的机会，夺取更加巨大、更加显赫的胜利，进而把伟大的抗美救国事业推向彻底胜利。
