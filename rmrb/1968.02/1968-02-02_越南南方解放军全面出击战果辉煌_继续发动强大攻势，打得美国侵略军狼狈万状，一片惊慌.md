The heroic armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam launched a full-scale offensive on January 30, fiercely attacking the enemy strongholds of Saigon and dozens of other occupied provincial capitals, important towns, and military bases in South Vietnam, achieving extremely splendid victories. Now, the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are advancing in victory, continuing to launch powerful offensives. Heartening reports of victories are continuously coming from various battlefields, striking the U.S. aggressor forces into disarray and panic.

According to reports, the National Liberation Front forces that entered Saigon, after raiding important targets such as the U.S. "Embassy" and the "Presidential Palace" on the night of January 30, attacked two enemy police stations in the Saigon city area at dawn on February 1; at noon, the U.S. military command in Vietnam was also attacked by snipers from the National Liberation Front forces; the Saigon radio station has been destroyed by the National Liberation Front forces. So far, fierce battles are still raging in the Saigon city area. The National Liberation Front forces have occupied several blocks in Saigon, and the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is flying high above the An Quang Temple in the city.

In addition, the National Liberation Front forces continued to attack the U.S. base at New Mountain in the suburbs of Saigon. The base's oil storage tanks were hit and caught fire, with flames soaring hundreds of feet high.

While the National Liberation Front forces were launching fierce attacks on the enemy in Saigon, more and more people in Saigon, as well as officials and soldiers from the puppet government and army, joined the National Liberation Front forces to strike against the U.S. and puppet forces. Now, the U.S. and puppet forces in Saigon are in a state of panic and chaos. The U.S. military radio station is shouting that Saigon is "in danger throughout the city."

On January 31, the National Liberation Front forces and local people also attacked many occupied provincial capitals, important towns, and military bases in the provinces of Bien Hoa, Tuy Hoa, Can Tho, Phan Rang, Bien Hoa-Tan Thuan, and My Tho, achieving splendid results.

In Bien Hoa province, the artillery of the National Liberation Front forces fiercely bombarded the Bien Hoa U.S. Air Force strategic base and the command headquarters of the U.S. Second Field Force in Bien Hoa City. Two ammunition depots at the Bien Hoa base were hit and exploded, and many U.S. aircraft were destroyed. Meanwhile, the guerrillas and people of Bien Hoa province cut off the enemy's strategic transportation line from Bien Hoa to Saigon.

The military and people of Tuy Hoa province launched simultaneous attacks on the provincial capital of Tuy Hoa City and various towns, transportation lines, and enemy strongholds throughout the province at dawn on January 31. The National Liberation Front forces completely occupied the enemy's camp, the residence of the commander of the puppet 9th Division's 14th Regiment, the administrative offices of Tuy Hoa province, and the residence of the puppet "provincial governor." The enemy's Tuy Hoa airfield also suffered heavy losses, and many aircraft could not take off. All the enemy's artillery positions in Tuy Hoa City were completely paralyzed.

In Can Tho province, the National Liberation Front forces, together with the local people, launched a fierce attack on the provincial capital of Can Tho City early on January 31, annihilating a large number of enemies, destroying the Can Tho City radio station and many enemy military facilities, and controlling half of the city for more than an hour.

The military and people of Phan Rang province launched a fierce attack on the enemy base, the residence of the puppet "provincial governor," and the command post of the military district in Phan Rang City early on January 31, and simultaneously attacked the enemy airfield. They captured two enemy artillery bases. The people of Phan Rang City and its suburbs joined the National Liberation Front forces, beating drums and bamboo gongs to pursue the fleeing enemies. The National Liberation Front forces had completely controlled the city area of Phan Rang by that morning, annihilating a large number of enemies and capturing many weapons. All the puppet military sub-districts in Phan Rang province were surrounded by the National Liberation Front forces and local people on the same day.

On January 31, the National Liberation Front forces in the New An-Tan Thuan area fiercely attacked the command post of the puppet 25th Division and the city of De Hoa, killing and wounding many enemies. In My Tho province, the National Liberation Front forces attacked the U.S. base at Phuoc Long and My Tho City.

The National Liberation Front forces also simultaneously attacked 16 out of 18 towns in the southern plains of South Vietnam on January 31, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

The National Liberation Front forces, together with the local people, have already controlled the provincial capital of Chu Duc province, Chu Duc City.

With the support of local people, the National Liberation Front forces in the provinces of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, and Quang Binh also launched fierce attacks on various important occupied towns and enemy bases on January 31.
