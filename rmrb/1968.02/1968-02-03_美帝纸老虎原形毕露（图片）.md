The recent victories of the South Vietnamese military and people during the Lunar New Year have made Johnson anxious and terrified. This is Johnson on January 31st in a meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C., looking like a restless ant on a hot pan, in a pathetic state.

On January 31st, the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people launched a surprise attack on the U.S. "embassy" in the center of Saigon. The U.S. invading forces were caught off guard and fled in disarray.

The South Vietnamese Liberation Army, after attacking important targets such as the U.S. "embassy" and the fake "presidential palace" in Saigon, continued to fight fiercely in the city. The image shows U.S. invading forces annihilated by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in Saigon on February 1st.

When the master gets beaten, the servant suffers. After suffering heavy casualties, the fake Saigon army is seen carrying their injured comrades and fleeing in disarray.
