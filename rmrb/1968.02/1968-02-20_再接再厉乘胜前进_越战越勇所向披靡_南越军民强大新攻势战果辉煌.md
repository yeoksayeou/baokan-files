The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, on the night of February 17 and the early morning of February 18, launched fierce attacks on many enemy military headquarters and bases from Quang Tri Province to the Mekong Delta, once again giving the American aggressors and their lackeys the punishment they deserve.

According to preliminary reports, the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam attacked more than forty towns and U.S. military bases, including nine airports such as New Mountain One and Bien Hoa, as well as a series of military targets in Bien Hoa, Long Binh, Kien Tuong, Cu Chi, Xuan Loc, Lai Thieu, Phu Loi, Go Cong, Ben Tre, My Tho, My Thuan, Tra Vinh, Soai Rap, Di An, Vinh Long, Phu Quoc, Kontum, Quang Duc, Da Lat, Phan Rang, and Phu Bai.

In the Gia Dinh area of Saigon, the thunderous sound of cannons shook the earth. New Mountain One Airport was hit by the artillery of the people's liberation forces, and smoke filled the sky. At noon on the 18th, this airport was again heavily shelled by the people's liberation forces, suffering heavy losses. Nearly one hundred U.S. aggressors (most of them pilots and technical personnel) were killed or wounded. This airport has been paralyzed.

The headquarters of U.S. commander Westmoreland and the puppet army general staff, the U.S. naval base and large logistics base in Kien Tuong, as well as the command post of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division in Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province, were also heavily attacked by the people's liberation forces, suffering heavy losses. The people's liberation forces also attacked many enemy strongholds around Saigon, including the puppet army's Loyalty Military Training Camp and the enemy garrison at the Go Cong power plant.

In My Tho Province, the people's liberation forces attacked a base of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers.

In the provincial capital of Phan Rang, Binh Thuan Province, the people's liberation forces entered the city, annihilated many enemies, occupied many targets within the city, and opened the prison, rescuing hundreds of patriots.

In addition, the people's liberation forces also attacked the enemy's airbase in Kontum City and many enemy strongholds in Kontum, Da Lat, Quang Tri, Binh Dinh, and other provinces and cities, achieving new victories.

The military and civilian people of Long An Province, located west of Saigon, and Ben Tre Province in the Mekong Delta, in the triumphant song of the New Year's great victory, advanced with the victory, and at dawn on February 18, launched fierce attacks on a series of enemy strongholds and military and political headquarters, annihilating a large number of enemies.

According to preliminary reports, the people's liberation forces in Long An Province, in the early morning of the 18th, in the battle to attack the Co Hoa stronghold and the De Huy military sub-region, destroyed an artillery position of the puppet 25th Division, annihilated an enemy security company, a militia company, and a combat police platoon, and completely annihilated a militia platoon guarding the outer area of the Co Hoa stronghold.

The Co Hoa stronghold is located on the east bank of the Dong Nai River in the northern part of Long An Province and is an important military base of the enemy. For several years, the American bandits and their lackeys have used this base to train commando units and as a starting point to harass the Vietnam-Cambodia border area. Now, the people's liberation forces have taken control of the Co Hoa stronghold and the De Huy military sub-region and are clearing out the Vietnamese traitors with the help of the local people. While attacking Co Hoa and De Huy, the liberation forces also attacked many enemy targets, including the Thua Duc puppet military sub-region, the headquarters of the puppet 25th Division, and the U.S. commando base in the Cha Co Canal area. The battle is still ongoing.

The people of De Hoa and De Huy counties have also risen up in large numbers, smashing the enemy's shackles of rule, and enthusiastically serving the front lines. They have also cut off the 7th Highway from Co Hoa to Thua Duc, the 8th Highway from Thua Duc to Cu Chi, the 9th Highway from De Hoa to Ho Men, and the 10th Highway from Luc Giang to Saigon. The enemy's transportation and logistics have been completely paralyzed.

At 00:10 on February 18, the military and civilian people of Ben Tre Province launched a new attack on Ben Tre City.

After shelling and destroying many military and political headquarters and barracks within the city, at 02:15, the liberation forces, divided into multiple columns, rushed into the city from all directions, quickly occupied the stadium and the enemy's artillery positions, annihilated and captured a large number of enemies. Then, the liberation forces again heavily attacked the 3rd Battalion of the puppet 10th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 10th Regiment of the puppet 7th Division in the Phu Giang area. Another detachment of the liberation forces directly attacked the rear base of the puppet 10th Regiment from the northwest, causing the enemy to panic and flee in disarray.

At 02:30, the liberation forces burned down an enemy ammunition depot, and the fire burned until dawn.

At 05:00, the liberation forces captured the Ben Tre City broadcasting station and defeated an enemy company in the Vu Van Chien area.

Currently, the liberation forces control many streets and important areas in Ben Tre City and, in cooperation with the citizens, are chasing and capturing stubborn enemy elements, continuing to annihilate the remaining enemies.

The military and civilian people of Ong Truong, Ba Tri, and Phu Tan counties, as well as many other areas within the province, are also closely cooperating with the military and civilian people of Ben Tre City, attacking various towns and military sub-regions, attacking transportation lines, and causing the enemy to fall into chaos, unable to rescue each other.

    再接再厉乘胜前进　越战越勇所向披靡
    南越军民强大新攻势战果辉煌
    同时猛攻四十多个城镇和美军基地，打得美伪军损失惨重
    隆安和槟椥省军民进攻敌人一系列的据点和首脑机构歼灭大批敌人
    新华社河内十九日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道：英雄的越南南方军民，二月十七日深夜和十八日凌晨，同时向从广治省到湄公河三角洲的敌人许多军事首脑机关和基地，发动猛烈进攻，再次给予美国侵略者及其走狗以应得的惩罚。
    据初步消息，越南南方人民解放武装力量袭击了四十多个城镇和美国军事基地里的敌人，其中包括新山一和边和等九个机场，以及在边和、龙平、芽?、古芝、西宁、莱溪、富利、守德、槟椥、芹苴、美萩、丐礼、朔庄、迪石、永隆、平绥、朱笃、昆嵩、广德、大叻、藩切和芙拜等地的一系列军事目标。
    在西贡嘉定地区，隆隆的炮声震天动地，新山一机场被人民解放武装力量的炮火击中，烟火弥漫。十八日中午，这个机场再次遭到人民解放武装力量猛烈炮轰，损失惨重。美国侵略军近一百名（其中大部分是驾驶员和技术人员）被打死打伤。这个机场已经陷于瘫痪。
    侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰的总部和伪军总参谋部，美国在芽?的海军基地和大型后勤基地以及嘉定省古芝县的美国第二十五步兵师的指挥所，也遭到人民解放武装力量的猛烈袭击，损失惨重。人民解放武装力量还进攻了西贡市周围的美伪军许多据点，其中包括伪军的光忠军事训练营和守德发电厂的敌军驻地等。

    协和据点位于隆安省北部东万古河沿岸，是敌人的一个重要军事基地。几年来，美国强盗及其走狗利用这个基地来训练别动队和把它当作骚扰越柬边界地区的出发点。现在，人民解放武装力量已经控制了协和据点和德惠军事支区，正在当地人民的协助下清除越奸恶棍。在进攻协和与德惠的同时，解放武装力量还进攻了厚义伪军事小区、伪军第二十五师司令部驻地和茶句渠地区的美国别动力量基地等许多敌军目标。目前，战斗还在继续进行。
