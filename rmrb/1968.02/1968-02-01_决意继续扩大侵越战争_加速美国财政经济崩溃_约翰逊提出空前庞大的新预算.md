	Johnson Proposes an Unprecedentedly Large New Budget

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on January 31, at a time when the U.S. economy is in unprecedented serious difficulties due to the Vietnam War, U.S. President Johnson, on January 29, submitted a new, unprecedentedly large budget to Congress. This fiscal year 1968-1969 budget plan indicates that U.S. imperialism is continuing to slide down the path of frenzied military buildup and further expansion of the Vietnam War, accelerating the collapse of the already riddled U.S. economy.

	According to Johnson's budget message, the total expenditure for the next fiscal year starting July 1 will reach the highest figure in U.S. history—$186.1 billion, an increase of $10.4 billion over the 1967-1968 fiscal year. Even according to Johnson's optimistic calculations, including the planned tax increase of $12 billion, the annual budget revenue will only be $178.1 billion. Thus, the budget deficit will still be $8 billion. However, the actual deficit situation is undoubtedly much more severe. The U.S. ruling class, in order to conceal the true extent of the budget deficit, has always resorted to tricks such as reducing expenditures and exaggerating revenues. For example, in the 1967-1968 fiscal year budget, Johnson estimated the deficit to be $8.1 billion last January, but the latest revised estimate is $19.8 billion, more than double the original estimate. Now, in a situation where the dollar's position is precarious, the U.S. economy is in unprecedented financial straits, and inflation is severe, Johnson once again proposes a new budget containing a massive deficit. This clearly indicates that the U.S. ruling class is completely unable to escape the worsening financial predicament and will inevitably plunge the U.S. economy into an even deeper crisis.

	The U.S. budget has been showing huge deficits year after year, mainly due to U.S. imperialism's aggressive and expansionist policies abroad, frenzied military buildup, and massive military spending. According to Johnson's budget, direct military spending for the next fiscal year will set a new record since World War II, reaching $79.8 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion over the budget proposed last January; of this, the Vietnam War expenditure remains the largest item, at $25 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion over the 1967-1968 budget. It should be noted that Johnson, fearing that it would provoke stronger public opposition to the Vietnam War, has significantly reduced the actual figures for Vietnam War spending in the new budget in an attempt to deceive. According to information leaked from within the U.S. ruling class, U.S. spending on the Vietnam War in 1967 had "at least already exceeded $30 billion." As the Vietnam War continues to "escalate," future spending in this area will undoubtedly far exceed the current budget figures.

	Johnson's message also indicates that U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, will continue to expand nuclear armaments, and on the other hand, will vigorously expand conventional armaments, attempting to further suppress the burgeoning national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	Faced with insurmountable financial difficulties, Johnson seeks to rely on increased taxation and further exploitation of the working people to fill the huge budget deficit. In his message, he repeatedly emphasizes the need for tax increases and anxiously says that if taxes are not increased, the U.S. economy will face the danger of "collapse." In this election year, despite the strong discontent of the broad masses of people, Johnson openly calls for increased tax burdens on the people, fully exposing his helpless predicament in the face of an unprecedented financial crisis.

    决意继续扩大侵越战争　加速美国财政经济崩溃
    约翰逊提出空前庞大的新预算
    据新华社三十一日讯  华盛顿消息：在美国财政经济由于侵越战争而陷入空前严重的困境的时候，美国总统约翰逊一月二十九日向国会提出了一个新的空前庞大的预算。这项一九六八——一九六九年度预算计划表明，美帝国主义正在继续沿着疯狂扩充军备和进一步扩大侵越战争的绝路滑下去，把已经千疮百孔的美国财政经济加速引向崩溃。
    根据约翰逊提出的预算咨文，今年七月一日开始的下一财政年度的预算支出总和，将达到美国历史上的最高数字——一千八百六十一亿美元，比一九六七——一九六八年度又增加一百零四亿美元。而全年的预算收入，即使按照约翰逊的如意算盘，把计划中的增税收入一百二十亿美元包括进去，也只有一千七百八十一亿美元。这样，预算亏空仍达八十亿美元。但是，亏空的实际情况肯定比这严重得多。美国统治集团为了隐瞒预算亏空的真相，一向玩弄缩小开支、夸大收入的花招。以一九六七——一九六八年度预算为例，约翰逊在去年一月估计赤字为八十一亿美元，而最近修正了的最新估计则是一百九十八亿美元，比原来的估计高出一倍多。现在，在美元地位千钧一发、美国财政空前拮据、通货膨胀十分严重的情况下，约翰逊又一次提出包含庞大赤字的新预算，这显然表明美国统治集团完全无法摆脱财政日益恶化的险境，而且必然会使美国财政经济陷入更加深重的危机。
    美国预算连年出现巨额亏空，主要是美帝国主义对外推行侵略和扩张政策、疯狂扩军备战、大量支出军费造成的结果。根据约翰逊提出的预算，下年度的直接军费开支又将创二次大战结束以来的新纪录，达到七百九十八亿美元，比去年一月提出的本年度预算增加四十三亿美元；其中侵越军费仍是最主要的一项，占二百五十亿美元，比一九六七——一九六八年度预算又增加三十九亿美元。必须指出的是，约翰逊由于害怕激起人民对侵越战争的更强烈的反对，在新预算中大大缩小了侵越战争开支的实际数字，妄图进行欺骗。据美国统治集团内部传出的消息，美国侵越军费在一九六七年就“至少已经突破三百亿美元”。随着侵越战争的进一步“升级”，今后这方面的开支无疑将大大超过目前提出的预算数字。
    约翰逊的咨文还表明，美帝国主义一方面要继续扩充核军备，另一方面还要大力扩充常规军备，妄图加紧镇压蓬勃发展的亚非拉民族解放斗争。
    面对着无法解决的财政困难，约翰逊企图依靠增加税收、进一步压榨劳动人民，来填补巨大的预算亏空。他在咨文中一再强调必须增税，并且忧心忡忡地说，如果不增税，美国的经济就有“崩溃的危险”。在今年这个大选年，约翰逊不顾广大人民的强烈不满，公开要求加重人民的税收负担，这充分说明了他在空前严重的财政危机面前束手无策的窘境。
