The red sun rises from the Eastern Sea,
A thousand rays of light shine in all directions.
The cultural revolution is thriving,
People change their thoughts, the land changes its appearance.
Not to mention the revolutionary alliance singing a victory song,
Nor to mention the red flags of industry and agriculture flying high.
Chairman Mao issues the order to "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism",
And composes a new chapter of poetry about eagles soaring in the sky.

One day, the sky was clear and the weather was good,
Iron eagles spread their wings and soared through the sky.
A flower blooms on every branch,
Speaking of an iron eagle with Li Hongxiang inside.
Look at him, his tiger eyes shining brightly,
Full of vigor and high spirits.
He completed each subject according to regulations,
As if he were on a battlefield capturing a wolf.

Suddenly, the ground control tower sent a message,
Informing him that the weather was bad and to return to base.
Li Hongxiang replied loudly, "Good, good, good,"
He looked up at the sky again, carefully observing.

But all he saw were dark clouds swirling below,
Like wild horses running free.
Li Hongxiang, seeing this situation, did not delay,
Quickly turned back and lowered his altitude.

But who would have known that the sky was full of changing winds,
In an instant, the machine was surrounded by thick fog.
Li Hongxiang's vision was completely obscured,
He could not see the runway anywhere.

At this moment, the ground control tower sent another message,
Bringing the concern and hope of his comrades.
"Comrade Li Hongxiang, the sky is thick with fog, very dangerous.
We hope you follow Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties to win victory.'"
"Yes! 'Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties to win victory.'"

Li Hongxiang's determination was as firm as a rock,
His eyes blazed with anger as he stared at the sea of clouds.
The iron eagle spiraled down to one thousand meters,
The machine shook violently.

Upon closer inspection, it was found that the fuel had run out,
The engine stopped in mid-air, malfunctioning.
It was truly like climbing a mountain with no direct path,
Or sailing a ship encountering headwinds.

The situation was urgent, like a fire burning the eyebrows,
But Li Hongxiang remained calm in the face of danger.
He suddenly looked up and saw Chairman Mao's portrait in front of him,
Li Hongxiang felt a surge of strength:
Chairman Mao,
With you, I am not afraid of the thick fog in the sky,
With you, I fear not the strong winds and raging waves.
You wave your hand, and I march forward,
Even if it means facing mountains of knives and seas of fire, I dare to charge ahead.

Chairman Mao said: 'This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue the fight.'

Selfless warriors are fearless,
Li Hongxiang's spirit is like a rainbow, his will is like steel.
He quickly reported the situation to the commander,
Requesting permission to glide and land at the airport.

The commander heard the report and quickly replied,
"If the situation is urgent, you can jump out of the cockpit with a parachute."
"Parachute!"

Li Hongxiang heard the words "parachute" and thought to himself,
The commander made a quick decision and issued the order,
This is his goodwill towards the people.

But Chairman Mao's requirements for revolutionary soldiers are: 'Extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people.'

Chairman Mao's teachings are like thunder,
Li Hongxiang engraved the two "extremes" in his heart.

The airplane is the property of the state and the people,
It is entrusted to me by the Party and the people.
Every nut and bolt is filled with the Party's and the people's hopes.

Not jumping means risking one's life,
But personal safety cannot be placed above the people's interests.
We are the people's pilots,
A red heart forever loyal to the Party.

Li Hongxiang thought of this and quickly spoke,
His words were like the resonant sound of a bell.
"Reporting to the commander,"
In front of me, there are a thousand difficulties,
But in front of me, there is the beloved portrait of Chairman Mao.

The red sun illuminates my path,
The red sun warms my heart,
The red sun gives me wisdom and courage,
Thousands of difficulties and dangers cannot stop me.

I will definitely make the iron eagle land safely,
And meet my comrades in victory at the airport.

"Good! Good!"

The commander heard Li Hongxiang's words,
His blood boiled with excitement.
Thinking back,
Li Hongxiang's family had been laborers for three generations,
Their blood and tears wrote a book of sorrow.

It was Chairman Mao who saved his family from the pit of fire,
It was Chairman Mao who gave him wings of iron.

Drinking water, one should not forget the well-digger,
A poor child who has risen should not forget the Communist Party.

Since the day Li Hongxiang joined the army,
He has always carried the four volumes of Chairman Mao's works.
He studied hard for the revolution without slacking off,
He set an example for everyone with his public spirit.

Chairman Mao issued the new order to "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism,"
He wrote a pledge overnight.

It said:
"Loyal to Chairman Mao for life,
Be a hero in criticizing and repudiating revisionism."

Such a good comrade with a red heart like fire,
Will definitely break through the thick fog and return to the airport.

The commander thought more and more,
Full of joy, he spoke:
"Good! Comrade Li Hongxiang, I wish you success!"
"Be responsible to the people!"

Li Hongxiang's reply was like thunder,
He piloted the iron eagle with unwavering confidence forward.
He saw the clusters of clouds behind him,
Like a battleship breaking through a thousand waves.

The iron eagle descended to six hundred meters,
Suddenly, a ray of light appeared in front.

"Cloud gap!"

Li Hongxiang saw this scene and was overjoyed,
He quickly turned the steering wheel and pushed the lever to leave the cloudy sky.

The comrades on the ground saw the iron eagle emerge from the clouds,
They jumped and clapped their hands.
One said, "Li Hongxiang is truly extraordinary,"
Another said, "This is another blow to the 'survival philosophy' of the Chinese Khrushchev."

One said, "Selfless people are fearless,"
Another said, "All because of Mao Zedong Thought arming us."

Temporarily not mentioning the comrades on the ground discussing joyfully,
In an instant, the iron eagle landed safely on the ground.

Hurrah! The crowd was like a boiling pot,
They surged forward in waves, surrounding Li Hongxiang.
"Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"
The cheers shook the mountains.

Looking up at the sky, the thick clouds retreated,
The golden sun shone with a thousand rays.

    红太阳照长空（唱词）
    北文
    唱：一轮红日出东海，
    万道霞光照四方。
    文化革命形势好，
    人换思想地换装。
    且不说革命联合奏凯歌，
    也不说工业农业红旗扬。
    毛主席发出“斗私，批修”战
      斗令，
    又谱出鹰击长空诗一章。
    那一天万里长空天气好，
    一架架铁鹰展翅把天上。
    满枝花开表一朵，
    说一只铁鹰里坐着李洪祥。
    你看他一双虎目亮晶晶，
    英姿勃勃斗志昂。
    按规定做了科目一个个，
    犹如那身临战场擒豺狼。
    突然间地面塔台传来话，
    通知他天气不好快返航。
    李洪祥连声回答“好好好”，
    举双目又把长空细打量。
    但只见翼下乌云纵横飞，
    恰好似奔驰的烈马脱了缰。
    李洪祥见此情况不怠慢，
    急忙返航把高度降。
    那知道长空风云变幻急，
    霎时间机身周围腾雾浪。
    李洪祥视线完全被遮住，
    看不见机场跑道在哪方。
    这时候地面塔台又传来话，
    送来了战友的关怀和希望。
    白：“李洪祥同志，高空大雾浓重，危
    险甚多。希望你按照毛主席的
    教导‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排
    除万难，去争取胜利。’”
    “是！‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，
    排除万难，去争取胜利。’”
    唱：李洪祥决心下定如磐石坚，
    两只眼怒视云海炯炯发光。
    铁鹰盘旋下降到一千米，
    机身猛然抖动直摇晃。
    细查看才知汽油已烧尽，
    发动机空中停车出故障。
    真正是上山无有直路走，
    行船偏遇迎头浪。
    情况紧急火烧眉，
    李洪祥面对险情心不慌。
    猛抬头看见面前毛主席像，
    李洪祥顿觉浑身有力量：
    毛主席呀，
    有您在不怕高空雾重重，
    有您在何惧风大浪又狂。
    您老人家挥手我前进，
    纵然是刀山火海也敢闯。
    白：“毛主席说：‘这个军队具有一往
    无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌
    人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不
    论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只
    要还有一个人，这个人就要继
    续战斗下去。’”
   唱：无私的战士最无畏，
    李洪祥雄心如虹志如钢。
    他急忙把情况报告指挥员，
    请求滑翔迫降在机场。
    指挥员听了回报忙答话，
    白：“李洪祥同志，如情况紧急，你
    可以跳伞出座舱。”
    白：“跳伞！”
    唱：李洪祥闻听跳伞两个字，
    心里不住暗思量：
    指挥员当机立断把命令下，
    这是他向人民负责一片好心
        肠。
    白：“可是，毛主席对我们革命战士
    的要求是‘对工作的极端的负
    责任，对同志对人民的极端的
    热忱’呀！”
    唱：毛主席教导象春雷响，
    李洪祥两个“极端”刻心上。
    白：“飞机是国家和人民的财产，是
    党和人民交给我的，每个螺帽，
    每颗铆钉，都寄托着党和人民
    的殷切希望啊！”
    唱：不跳伞虽然生命有危险，
    白：“可是，个人的安危”，
    唱：那能够摆在人民利益之上。
    我们是人民的飞行员，
    一颗红心永远忠于党。
    李洪祥想到此处忙发话，
    一句句就象洪钟响当当。
    白：“报告指挥员同志，”
    唱：我面前虽有困难千万重，
    我面前更有敬爱的毛主席像。
    红太阳照亮我前进路，
    红太阳温暖着我心房，
    红太阳给我智慧给我胆，
    千难万险无阻挡。
    我定叫铁鹰安全着大地，
    与战友胜利会师在机场。
    白：“好！好！”
    唱：指挥员听了洪祥一席话，
    激动得热血阵阵往上涨。
      想从前，
    洪祥家祖宗三代扛长工，
    血和泪写成一本苦情账。
    是毛主席打救他家出火坑，
    是毛主席给他插上铁翅膀。
    吃水不忘打井人，
    穷孩子翻身不忘共产党。
    洪祥他自从入伍那天起，
    就把四卷宝书捧手上。
    为革命刻苦学习不放松，
    立“公”字他为大家树榜样。
    毛主席发出“斗私，批修”新
      号令，
    他连夜写了决心书一张。
    上写着：
        一辈子忠于毛主席，
        斗私，批修当闯将。
    这样的好同志红心似火，
    定能够破重雾返回机场。
    指挥员越思越想越激动，
    满怀喜悦把话讲：
    白：“好！李洪祥同志，祝你成功！”
    “向人民负责！”
    唱：李洪祥一声回答响如雷，
    驾铁鹰信心百倍向前方。
    只见那团团云雾身后去，
    恰好似战舰踏破千重浪。
    铁鹰下滑到六百米，
    在前面突然出现一缕光。
    白：“云缝！”
    唱：李洪祥见此情景心欢喜，
    急忙忙转舵推杆离云乡。
    地面的同志一见铁鹰出了云，
    一个个跳着蹦着拍巴掌。
    这个说：“李洪祥真是不简单”，
    那个说：“这又给中国赫鲁晓夫
        ‘活命哲学’一大棒。”
    这个说：“无私的人儿最无畏”，
    那个说：“全因为毛泽东思想来
        武装”。
    暂不说地面同志喜谈论，
    转眼间铁鹰平安落地上。
    呼啦啦人群就象开了锅，
    似潮涌团团围住李洪祥。
      “毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    欢呼声震得山摇晃。
    望长空浓云朵朵齐退去，
    更觉得金色太阳光万丈。
