In a meeting in 1957, the Chinese Khrushchev said: “Heroes have no place to show their prowess. Now there is no landlord class, the bourgeoisie has been eliminated by us.” Look! He speaks so lightly! According to him, there are no classes and class struggle anymore.

Is it really true that there are no classes and class struggle? No! Take our situation at San Tiao Shi as an example. It is completely different from what the Chinese Khrushchev said, “The capitalists have handed over their factories, except for a few individuals, they no longer want to resist socialism.” On the contrary, the capitalists are even more deceitful and are fighting against us. What they say, think, and do is not socialist at all. There was a capitalist who, during the public-private partnership, smiled and cried while following everyone to set off firecrackers. Later, he gritted his teeth and glared, saying, “Hmph! You can take away my sign, but you can’t take away my heart!” See! The person is still there, but the heart is not dead. There is a capitalist at San Tiao Shi who earns a hundred or so yuan a month. He smiles and laughs when he sees us, but in reality, he is hiding a knife. He designed a forging workshop. Everyone knows that this workshop deals with fire all day, so you have to be careful about fire prevention, but he deliberately used oilcloth and wooden boards to build the house. Soon, this workshop caught fire and was burned down. Another capitalist made a double-layer cover for a coffin with his factory signboard. What does this mean? It means he won’t forget his business even after he dies. During the “Five Anti” campaign, this capitalist’s wife resisted the movement and drowned in a well. His dog of a son kept a lock of her hair and a pair of shoes. When the Cultural Revolution began, this mad dog thought it was time and jumped out, shouting everywhere that he wanted to “take revenge.” These facts clearly show that the class struggle is very intense!

We old workers at San Tiao Shi deeply know how much blood and sweat Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have shed to liberate us! We also know how much the capitalists hate our Party and the working class. Chairman Mao teaches us: Never forget class struggle. This great teaching, we have never forgotten for a day. We have carried out socialist reforms on the enterprises run by capitalists, but their reactionary thoughts still exist in their minds. Capitalists and we workers are fundamentally two different kinds of people, we are sworn enemies. They smile, and we cry; we smile, and they are unhappy from the heart. In the past, how many class brothers were beaten to death, tortured to death, and thrown into the North Canal! This blood debt we have not forgotten! Class struggle is a struggle of you or me, a struggle of needle against grain. In the struggle, if the working class takes a moment to rest, it will be calculated by the class enemy in secret, and we will suffer great losses and make big mistakes.

What kind of vine bears what kind of fruit, what kind of class says what kind of words. What kind of person is the Chinese Khrushchev? We old workers at San Tiao Shi all know him well. Since 1949, when he came to Tianjin and kissed the big capitalists, he has shown his true colors! He is the head servant of the capitalists, a filial son and grandson! He is our working class’s sworn enemy! On one hand, he incites capitalists to fight against us workers and attack us. On the other hand, he pours into our ears things like “unite with capitalists!” and “class struggle has ended!” The Chinese Khrushchev wants to deceive us with the ghost story of “extinguishing class struggle,” wants us to lose our vigilance against the enemy, and disarm us. Once we are complacent and sing the song of peace, he will lead the capitalists to counterattack us, snatch away our power, let the bourgeoisie rule over us, and make us suffer again.

Tell you, Chinese Khrushchev! Your abacus is off! You want to restore capitalism, we will never agree! The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought has long seen through your tricks. We old workers in our fifties and sixties are determined to fight with you, fight to the end; determined to fight with all harmful creatures for generations, fight to the end! Can this be said to be “heroes have no place to show their prowess”? No! Heroes have a great place to show their prowess!

    中国赫鲁晓夫算盘打错了！
    天津蒸汽机厂三条石老工人　祁振声
    在一九五七年的一次会上，中国赫鲁晓夫说：“英雄无用武之地，现在再没有地主阶级，资产阶级被我们消灭了”。看！说得多么轻快！照他说来，就没有阶级和阶级斗争了。
    真是没有阶级和阶级斗争了吗？不！拿我们三条石的情况来说，完全不象中国赫鲁晓夫说的“资本家已经把工厂交出来了，除开极少数的分子以外，他们已经不愿意反抗社会主义了”。相反，资本家倒是更加两面三刀，和我们斗争。他们说的、想的、做的，一点儿都不是社会主义。有一个资本家，公私合营时，他咧着嘴，半哭不笑地跟着大家放鞭炮，事后却咬着牙瞪着眼说：“哼！你们能摘掉我的牌子，你们摘不了我的心！”你看！人还在，心不死嘛！三条石有个资本家，一个月拿着一百几十块钱的工资，见面嘻嘻哈哈，实际是笑里藏刀。他设计了一个锻工车间。谁都知道这种车间成天跟火打交道，得注意防火，可他偏偏用油毡和木板盖房子。不久，这个车间果然失了火，都给烧了。还有个资本家，把“他”的工厂牌匾做了一个棺材的二层盖。这是什么意思呢？就是说他死了也不忘他的买卖。“五反”时这个资本家的老婆抗拒运动，投水缸死了，他的狗儿子把死人的头发留下一缕，鞋留下一双。文化大革命开始后，这条疯狗认为到了时候，蹦了出来，口口声声到处喊着要“报仇”。这种种事实，不正好说明阶级斗争十分激烈吗！
    我们三条石的老工人，深深知道毛主席和共产党是花了多少心血和代价才把我们解放出来的！我们也知道资本家们又是多么仇视我们党和工人阶级。毛主席教导我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。这一伟大教导，我们一天也没有忘。我们对资本家办的企业实行了社会主义改造，可他们脑袋瓜里的反动思想还依然存在。资本家和我们工人压根儿就是两条船的人，是死对头。他们笑，我们就得哭；我们笑，他们打心眼里就难受。在以前，有多少阶级弟兄被他们打死、折磨死，扔到了北运河！这笔血债我们至今没忘！阶级斗争，是有你没我，针尖对麦芒的斗争，在斗争中我们工人阶级如果稍一喘口气，就会遭到阶级敌人明里暗里的计算，就会吃大亏，误大事。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。中国赫鲁晓夫是什么人？我们三条石老工人对他都很熟，因为打一九四九年他来天津和大资本家亲嘴以后，他早就现了原形啦！他是资本家的大总管，孝子贤孙哪！是我们工人的死对头！一方面，他鼓动资本家向我们工人斗，向我们进攻，另一方面，他又往我们耳朵里灌什么“要联合资本家啦！”什么阶级斗争也“结束”啦！中国赫鲁晓夫就是想以阶级斗争“熄灭”的鬼话骗我们，想叫我们丧失对敌人的警惕性，解除我们的武装。我们一麻痹，唱和平歌子，他就引着资本家向我们反攻过来，抢走我们的印把子，让资产阶级专我们的政，重新骑在我们头上，叫我们再受二遍苦。
    告诉你，中国赫鲁晓夫！你的算盘打错了，你想复辟资本主义，我们千万个不答应！用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，早就看穿了你的阴谋。我们这些五、六十岁的老工人，决心和你斗，斗到底；决心和一切害人虫斗上几代，斗到底！这能说“英雄无用武之地”吗？不！英雄大有用武之地！
