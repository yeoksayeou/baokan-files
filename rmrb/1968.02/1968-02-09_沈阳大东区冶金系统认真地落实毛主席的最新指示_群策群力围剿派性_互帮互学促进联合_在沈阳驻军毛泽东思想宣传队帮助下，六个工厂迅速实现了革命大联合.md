With the help of the People's Liberation Army Shenyang Garrison Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the revolutionary masses of six factories in the metallurgical system of Shenyang's Dadong District, including Liaoning Steel Plant, Seamless Steel Pipe Plant, Aluminum Pipe Plant, Steel Pipe Plant, Small Rolling Mill, and Metallurgical Powder Plant, have promoted the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao. They have pooled their wisdom to eliminate factionalism, forming a mass movement to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The six factories have quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

	Any advanced experience that promotes the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and facilitates great unity should be eagerly learned.

In late last year, several revolutionary mass organizations in the Small Rolling Mill held a Mao Zedong Thought study class together. During discussions on revolutionary great unity, various factions temporarily quarreled over some non-principled issues. At this time, the *People's Daily* published an article on Shenyang Bearing Plant, which advocated Chairman Mao's revolutionary learning style and held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. This had a significant impact on everyone. Many people said, "The Bearing Plant is just across the street from our factory. They have good experiences, why shouldn't we learn from them?" Some people disagreed, saying, "Our factory has several factions, and theirs also has several factions. Can we learn from them?" Everyone said: Learning from advanced experiences, regardless of which faction they come from, as long as they are beneficial to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and promoting revolutionary great unity, we should eagerly learn from them.

The initiative to go out and learn from advanced experiences was enthusiastically supported by the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory. Representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations in the entire factory were selected to learn from the advanced experiences at the Bearing Plant. The representatives listened to the leaders of the Bearing Plant sharing their experiences of taking the lead in self-criticism and overcoming factionalism. The more they listened, the more they felt restless, realizing that the strengths of others were their own weaknesses. As soon as they returned to the factory, they immediately reported to all the revolutionary mass organizations in the factory. Everyone compared Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the great situation of the nationwide Cultural Revolution, the advanced thoughts of the Bearing Plant, and their own actions. They were greatly educated, inspired, enlightened, and urged to take action. Originally, the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations had prepared a self-criticism outline representing their organizations. After learning from the Bearing Plant's experiences, their attitudes became higher, and their standards became stricter. Upon comparison, they felt a significant gap and voluntarily sought opinions from the opposing factions and their own organizations. Each person prepared again and eagerly took the lead in exposing their private thoughts, fighting against them, and doing self-criticism in front of the entire factory's masses to eliminate factionalism. The leaders said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest truth, the greatest principle. Not implementing revolutionary great unity according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions is factionalism at work, it is not taking the right path but the wrong one. The Small Rolling Mill learned from the advanced and surpassed them, achieving revolutionary great unity earlier than the Bearing Plant.

The comrades of the Small Rolling Mill felt that achieving unity within the factory was not enough and shared their experiences with the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant in the same system without reservation. The Seamless Steel Pipe Plant quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

	Any issue that hinders the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions should be proactively helped to resolve.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also to liberate all of humanity. The revolutionary workers of the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant, from their personal experience of being helped by the Small Rolling Mill, further deeply understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching. They said, "We are ahead, but we cannot forget our class brothers behind us." They first thought of their "sister factory," the Steel Pipe Plant, and their neighbor, the Aluminum Pipe Plant. The leaders of several revolutionary mass organizations in the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant, from various aspects, felt that these two factories could not unite because they had many "small hills" and were afraid of being "eaten" by others. Factionalism was blocking the way, and they should help them escape from the poison of factionalism.

Revolutionary mass organization leader Zhou Shijie and Li Changqing took the initiative to undertake this work.

Zhou Shijie and the leader of the revolutionary mass organization in the Steel Pipe Plant, Liu Zhibao, are neighbors and belong to two different factions in society. To promote the early achievement of revolutionary great unity in the sister factory, Comrade Zhou thought, in the past, we engaged in factionalism, treating comrades with different viewpoints as "enemies," and rarely interacted. This does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest." The more different the viewpoints, the more we should help each other and act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This is the best action to overcome factionalism. He visited Liu Zhibao three times, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, recalling bitterness and sweetness, and learning from the advanced experiences of other factories in doing more self-criticism and overcoming factionalism. With Comrade Zhou's help, Liu Zhibao expressed his determination to be a promoter of revolutionary great unity. Three days later, the Steel Pipe Plant united.

While Zhou Shijie was working on the Steel Pipe Plant, Li Changqing was also working on the Aluminum Pipe Plant, promoting its quick achievement of great unity. That day, when Li Changqing arrived at the Aluminum Pipe Plant, he encountered a leader of a revolutionary mass organization with the same viewpoint, who was arguing over seating positions with some masses and posting slogans detrimental to revolutionary great unity. Li Changqing immediately propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to them, sharing his experiences in fighting against the idea of competing for seats and overcoming factionalism. This deeply moved the leader, who immediately put away the detrimental slogans he had already written.

	Learn from and help each other to seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

"One advanced, all learn; one in difficulty, all help." Liaoning Steel Plant is the largest factory in the metallurgical system of Dadong District and has not yet achieved revolutionary great unity. The Seamless Steel Pipe Plant, Small Rolling Mill, Metallurgical Powder Plant, and other brother units and revolutionary workers have sent their experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions through various forms to promote their quick achievement of revolutionary great unity. Old worker Li Wentong of the oxygen production station in Liaoning Steel Plant saw that the brother factories had united and was very happy. He went everywhere to learn from advanced experiences, frequently finding the leaders of his own organization and the opposing organization to promote them to quickly achieve revolutionary great unity according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary workers of the oxygen production station, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, became the first unit in Liaoning Steel Plant to achieve revolutionary great unity. With the promotion of brother units, inside and outside the factory, up and down, left and right, they learned from and helped each other, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity.

The mass movement to pool wisdom and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions has enhanced the great unity of the working class, presenting a moving scene of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced everywhere. The broad revolutionary workers of the six factories consciously strive to be promoters of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fighters against factionalism, and supervisors of consolidating revolutionary great unity.

    沈阳大东区冶金系统认真地落实毛主席的最新指示
    群策群力围剿派性  互帮互学促进联合
    在沈阳驻军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，六个工厂迅速实现了革命大联合
    据新华社沈阳八日电　在人民解放军沈阳驻军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，沈阳市大东区冶金系统辽宁钢厂、无缝钢管厂、铝管厂、钢管厂、小型轧钢厂、冶金粉末厂等六个工厂的革命群众，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命学风，群策群力围歼派性，形成了一个群众性的全面落实毛主席最新指示的革命大竞赛，六个工厂分别迅速实现了革命大联合。
      凡是推动落实毛主席最新指示，促进大联合的先进经验，就要抢着学
    小型轧钢厂几派革命群众组织在去年年底联合举办了毛泽东思想学习班。在商讨革命大联合时，各派一时为一些非原则性问题发生了争执。这时，《人民日报》发表了沈阳轴承厂大立毛主席倡导的革命学风，联合办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验，对大家震动很大。许多人说：“轴承厂就在我们厂斜对门，人家有了好经验，咱们为啥不去学一学？”有的人不同意，说：“咱们厂好几派，人家厂也好几派，能学到一块去吗？”大家说：学先进，不管是哪一派，只要有利于落实毛主席最新指示，促进革命大联合的先进经验，就应该抢着学。
    走出门学先进经验的倡议，得到了驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的热情支持。全厂各革命群众组织选派了代表，到轴承厂学习先进经验。代表们听了轴承厂头头带头做自我批评、克服派性的经验介绍，越听越坐不住，感到人家的长处，正是自己的短处。一回到厂，他们就立即分头向全厂各派革命群众组织做了传达。大家对照毛主席的最新指示，摆全国文化大革命的大好形势，比轴承厂的先进思想，看自己的行动，大受教育，大受鼓舞，大受启发，大受鞭策。原先，各派革命群众组织的负责人，都代表本组织准备了一个自我批评的检查提纲，学了轴承厂的经验，姿态高了，标准严了，一对照感到差距很大，就主动到对方和本组织群众中征求意见，各自又重新做了准备，争着在全厂群众大会上亮私、斗私，带头做自我批评，狠斗派性。头头们说：毛主席的最新指示，是最大的道理，最大的原则，不按毛主席最新指示实现革命大联合，就是派性作怪，就是正路不走走歪路。小型轧钢厂学了先进超过先进，比轴承厂提前实现了革命大联合。
    小型轧钢厂的同志感到光本厂联合了还不够，又毫无保留地把自己的体会向本系统的无缝钢管厂作了介绍，无缝钢管厂也迅速实现了革命大联合。
      凡是影响落实毛主席最新指示的问题，就要主动帮助解决
    毛主席教导我们：无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。无缝钢管厂的革命工人，从小型轧钢厂帮助自己的切身感受中，进一步深刻领会了毛主席这一教导的伟大意义。他们说：“咱们走在前头，可不能忘了后头的阶级兄弟。”他们首先想到了自己的“姊妹厂”钢管厂和邻居铝管厂。无缝钢管厂几派革命群众组织负责人，从各方面了解，感到这两个厂联合不起来，和自己过去遇到的问题一样，考虑“小山头”多，怕别人“吃掉”自己，派性挡了道，应当去帮助他们从派性的毒害下解放出来。革命群众组织负责人周世杰和李长青主动担负起了这项工作。
    周世杰和钢管厂革命群众组织负责人刘志宝是邻居，在社会上是属于不同观点的两大派。为了推动兄弟厂早日实现革命大联合，周师傅想，过去咱们搞派性，把不同观点的同志当成“冤家对头”，很少往来，这不符合毛泽东思想。毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”，越是观点不一样，越要互相帮助，按毛主席最新指示办事，才是克服派性的最好行动。他三次找上门，针对刘志宝的活思想，和他一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起忆苦思甜，一起学习兄弟厂多做自我批评、克服派性的先进经验。在周师傅的帮助下，刘志宝表示要坚决做革命大联合的促进派。过了三天，钢管厂联合起来了。
    在周世杰给钢管厂做工作的同时，李长青也在做铝管厂的工作，促进铝管厂迅速实现了大联合。那天，李长青一到铝管厂，正遇上和他相同观点的一个革命群众组织负责人，为争席位问题，和一些群众在张贴不利于革命大联合的标语。李长青当即向他们宣传毛主席的最新指示，介绍自己同争席位思想作斗争、克服派性的体会，使这个负责人很受感动，马上把已经写好的不利于革命大联合的标语收了起来。
      互学互帮，认真地落实毛主席的最新指示
    “一家先进大家学，一家困难大家帮”。辽宁钢厂是大东区冶金系统最大的一个厂，一时还没有实现革命大联合。已经实现革命大联合的无缝钢管厂、小型轧钢厂、冶金粉末厂等兄弟单位和革命工人，通过各种形式送去自己落实毛主席最新指示的体会，促进他们尽快实现革命大联合。辽宁钢厂的制氧站老工人李文忠，看到兄弟厂联合了，非常高兴。他到处向人家学习先进经验，多次找自己组织和对方组织负责人，推动他们要赶快按毛主席最新指示实现革命大联合。制氧站革命工人在毛主席最新指示的指引下，成了辽宁钢厂第一个实现革命大联合的单位。这个厂在兄弟单位的推动下，厂里厂外，上下左右，互学互促，很快实现了革命大联合。
    群策群力落实毛主席最新指示的革命大竞赛，增进了工人阶级的大团结，到处呈现出一派落实毛主席最新指示学先进赶先进的动人景象。六个厂的广大革命工人，自觉争当促进落实毛主席最新指示的宣传员，围歼派性的战斗员，巩固革命大联合的监督员。
