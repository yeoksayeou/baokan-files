The People's Liberation Army should be a great school.
We must carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more extensively and deeply. As Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Chairman, has said: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atomic bomb of tremendous power." — New Year Editorial: *Greeting the Complete Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution*

Fully Implement Chairman Mao's Brilliant "May 7th" Directive to Turn the General Logistics Department into a Red School of Mao Zedong Thought

The second session of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works of the General Logistics Department concluded successfully, summarizing the experience of running a good school of Mao Zedong Thought, and passing a letter of respect to Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: Amidst the triumphant songs of achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the second session of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works of the General Logistics Department concluded successfully on the 19th. This conference is a mobilization meeting for all cadres and soldiers of the General Logistics Department to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest directives and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; it is also a rallying meeting to fully implement Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive and turn the General Logistics Department system into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

During the conference, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan, received all the representatives. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, education, and spur for all cadres and soldiers of the General Logistics Department.

During the more than thirty-day conference, nearly 2,000 representatives from the logistics frontlines across the country, with the deepest class feelings, enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically praised the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest directives and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speeches. They summarized and exchanged experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the midst of class struggle, implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, and further clarified their future combat tasks. The representatives expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Vice Chairman Lin Biao as a shining example, and run the General Logistics Department system, this school of Mao Zedong Thought, even better.

On May 7, 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the historic "May 7th" directive, calling for the People's Liberation Army and factories, rural areas, schools, commerce, services, and party and government organs to all become revolutionary schools. Over the past year, all units under the General Logistics Department, under the intimate care of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, under the brilliant guidance of the "May 7th" directive, and in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have actively participated in the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, criticized the capitalist-roaders in power headed by China's Khrushchev, participated in the "three supports, two militaries" work, established schools of Mao Zedong Thought, promoted the thought revolutionization of people and the organizational revolutionization of the General Logistics Department system, and achieved both spiritual and material bumper harvests.

The representatives reviewed the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and had a deeper understanding that the brilliant "May 7th" directive is a new development of Marxism-Leninism in an era, a new peak of scientific communism, a fundamental measure to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent capitalist restoration, a grand blueprint for building socialism and gradually transitioning to communism, and also the fundamental guideline for military construction. The great "May 7th" directive has pointed out the direction for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and provided the strongest and sharpest ideological weapon for the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle." The representatives pointed out: To turn the entire country and the entire army into schools of Mao Zedong Thought, it is necessary to go through fierce struggles between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. "The People's Liberation Army should be a great school," this is Chairman Mao's consistent military thought, this is the fundamental policy to build our army into a powerful revolutionary army of the proletariat. China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing have always pursued a bourgeois military line, opposing Chairman Mao's military thought and Chairman Mao's idea of turning our army into a revolutionary school. Only by thoroughly criticizing and exposing them, firmly defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carrying out the struggle between the two lines to the end, can we truly run this school of Mao Zedong Thought in our army well.

All the representatives unanimously pointed out: Vice Chairman Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, best student, and best successor. Vice Chairman Lin Biao holds the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought highest, follows Chairman Mao closest, studies Mao Zedong Thought best, understands it deepest, and applies it most actively. Vice Chairman Lin Biao has been loyal to, executed, and propagated the great Mao Zedong Thought for decades, bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The series of policies and principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, such as studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, carrying forward the three-eight style, promoting the three great democracies, and carrying out the four-good company movement, have raised the revolutionary construction of our army to a higher level and set a shining example for running schools of Mao Zedong Thought across the country.

The representatives summarized their experiences in running a good school of Mao Zedong Thought:

Actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, cultivating and fostering new people who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, is the fundamental policy for running a good school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Everyone said that Chairman Mao's great directive on "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" most concisely and scientifically summarizes the basic content of "criticizing the bourgeoisie" throughout the entire socialist historical period, is the most fundamental course in the school of Mao Zedong Thought, and criticizing revisionism must fight against selfishness. If the "self" is not overthrown, the country will be difficult to defend. Fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism is to overthrow the life of revisionism, change people's souls, achieve the thought revolutionization of people, and ensure that the proletarian heaven will never change color. The representatives, combining their own experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and changing their worldviews, deeply felt that the brilliant "Old Three Articles" are the strongest spiritual atomic bombs for fighting against selfishness, criticizing revisionism, and changing worldviews. The "Old Three Articles" use the most concise and colloquial language, the most vivid and sublime images, and the most profound and profound doctrines to thoroughly explain the proletarian worldview. Only by studying and applying the "Old Three Articles" well can we win battles on the battlefield of fighting against selfishness and achieve new merits on the frontline of criticizing revisionism. The representatives believe: To be a thorough revolutionary, one must consciously raise the struggle against selfishness to the height of the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of the proletariat and the working people, and it is also the lifeline for running a good school of Mao Zedong Thought. The struggle between the two lines is the fundamental issue that runs through everything and decides everything. Awareness of the struggle between the two lines is the most fundamental awareness. Being firm in the critical moment of the struggle between the two lines is the most precious quality, the highest wisdom, the greatest courage, the most fundamental "publicness," and the most solid skill of a proletarian revolutionary fighter. Running a good school of Mao Zedong Thought is to cultivate tens of thousands of iron soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, inheriting and carrying forward the revolutionary traditions of our army, and firmly walking the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, is the fundamental principle that must be followed to run a good school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives, through the great criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of seeing things but not people pursued by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing in logistics construction, had a deeper understanding of the great significance of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's directive on emphasizing politics, further understanding that political work is to manage thoughts, souls, and revolutionization, and is the general manager of all industries. Emphasizing proletarian politics and adhering to politics leading business is Chairman Mao's consistent military thought and is also the fundamental direction of logistics construction. The representatives pointed out that in logistics work, the greatest combat effectiveness is not money, not things, not technology, but people, people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With such people, everything can be created, everything can be mastered, everything can be changed, and everything can be decided. We must firmly grasp this direction, emphasize proletarian politics, and use the greatest effort to do well in the ideological and political work of people, adhere to arming the minds of all personnel with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and build our army into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In accordance with the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, we must throw ourselves into the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, which is the fundamental way to run a good school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives believe that only by throwing themselves into the three great revolutionary practices can they truly master Mao Zedong Thought and keep up with the great new era of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao decided that our army should participate in the "three supports, two militaries" work, which is a great strategic measure to make us, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, combine military, agriculture, industry, and civilian affairs. Many representatives from the frontlines of the "three supports, two militaries" deeply felt that the fiery class struggle is the best classroom for running a good school of Mao Zedong Thought. In this great classroom, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively with problems from the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the content of study is the richest, the soul is touched the deepest, and the effect is the most obvious. The representatives said: In accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, various industries in logistics, according to the principle of having a main and a secondary, one industry as the main, and learning other things, not only created a large number of material wealth but more importantly, greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of people and the organizational revolutionization of the General Logistics Department system. The representatives emphasized that the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are the great furnace for cultivating new people of communism. Only in this furnace can we truly forge new people of communism who have clear class views, firm mass views, strong labor views, and can fight and work.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely and unconditionally fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives is the fundamental guarantee for running a good school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives unanimously expressed that they would vigorously carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao himself, establish and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldiers and workers participating. Resolutely implement the principle of supporting the left but not the factions, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and achieve new merits for seizing a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

All the representatives attending the conference, with deep class feelings of infinite love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao. The conference also passed a letter of appeal to all cadres, soldiers, and families of the General Logistics Department.

The conference established nine advanced collectives and four advanced individuals as the standard-bearers of studying Chairman Mao's works in the General Logistics Department. They are: Chairman Mao's good soldier Nian Siyang; ten martyrs including Deputy Political Instructor Li Xianwen of a certain automobile regiment; the 6th Company of a certain automobile regiment; the 3516 Factory; the 3rd Team of a certain military horse farm; anti-flood heroes including Deputy Platoon Leader Huang Qingjing of a certain engineering regiment; the Kaijie Logistics Station; the "Iron Transport Team on the Sichuan-Tibet Line" of a certain automobile regiment; the Party Committee of a certain engineering regiment; the Technical Research Room of the 3502 Factory; the 73rd Herdsman of a certain military horse farm; Platoon Leader Hou Chaowen of the 6th Company of a certain engineering regiment; and Company Leader Zhang Wancai of the 14th Company of a certain engineering regiment.

    人民解放军应该是一个大学校。
    更加广泛和深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。正象林彪副主席所说的那样：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”　元旦社论：《迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利》

    把总后办成红彤彤毛泽东思想大学校
    总后勤部第二届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会胜利闭幕，总结了办好毛泽东思想大学校的经验，通过了给毛主席的致敬信
    新华社二十日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，中国人民解放军总后勤部第二届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，在十九日胜利闭幕。这次大会，是总后勤部全体指战员和革命职工全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的动员大会；是全面贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示，把人民解放军总后勤部系统办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的誓师大会。
    大会期间，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，以及周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、江青、姚文元等同志接见了全体代表，这是对总后勤部全体指战员和革命职工的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大教育、最大鞭策。
    在历时三十多天的大会上，来自祖国各地后勤战线上的近两千名代表，怀着最深厚的阶级感情，热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，热烈颂扬毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示和林彪副主席的重要讲话。他们以毛主席的最新指示为纲，总结交流了在阶级斗争大风大浪中活学活用毛泽东思想，贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示的经验，进一步明确了今后的战斗任务。代表们表示决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以林彪副主席为光辉榜样，把总后勤部系统这个毛泽东思想大学校办得更好。
    一九六六年五月七日，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了具有伟大历史意义的“五·七”指示，号召人民解放军和工厂、农村、学校、商业、服务行业、党政机关都应该成为一个革命化的大学校。一年多来，总后勤部所属各单位，在毛主席和林彪副主席的亲切关怀下，在“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，积极投入阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命实践，批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，参加“三支”“两军”工作，大办毛泽东思想大学校，促进了人的思想革命化和总后勤部系统的组织革命化，获得了精神和物质双丰收。
    到会代表回顾无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，更加深刻地认识到，光辉的“五·七”指示，是马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，是科学共产主义理论的新高峰，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的根本措施，是建设社会主义、逐步过渡到共产主义的宏伟纲领，也是我军建设的根本指针。伟大的“五·七”指示，给无产阶级文化大革命指明了前进的方向，为斗、批、改提供了最强大、最锐利的思想武器。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”代表们指出：把全国全军办成毛泽东思想大学校，是要经历两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争的。“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”，这是毛主席一贯的建军思想，这是把我军建设成为强大的无产阶级革命军队的根本方针。中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，一贯推行资产阶级军事路线，同毛主席的建军思想，同毛主席把我军办成革命化大学校的思想相对抗。只有把他们彻底批倒、批臭，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把两条路线的斗争进行到底，才能真正把我军这个毛泽东思想的大学校办好。
    到会代表一致指出：林彪副主席是毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生，最好的接班人。林彪副主席把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，跟毛主席最紧，对毛泽东思想学得最好，领会得最深，运用得最活。林彪副主席几十年如一日地忠实捍卫、执行、宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，英勇地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。林彪副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等一系列着重从政治上建军的方针原则，把我军的革命化建设提到了一个更高的水平，为全国大办毛泽东思想大学校树立了光辉榜样。
    代表们以自己的切身体会，总结了办好毛泽东思想大学校的经验：
    活学活用毛泽东思想，“斗私，批修”，培养和造就无限忠于毛主席的共产主义新人，是办好毛泽东思想大学校的根本方针。
    大家说，毛主席关于“要斗私，批修”的伟大指示，最精辟、最科学地概括了整个社会主义历史时期“批判资产阶级”的基本内容，是毛泽东思想大学校最根本的课程，批修必须斗私，斗私才能彻底批修，“私”字不倒，江山难保。斗私批修，就是要革修正主义的命，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，保证无产阶级的江山永不变色。代表们结合自己活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观的体会，深有感触地说：光辉的“老三篇”，是斗私批修改造世界观的最强大的精神原子弹。“老三篇”以最简练、最通俗的语言，最鲜明、最崇高的形象，最精辟、最深刻的道理，透彻地阐明了无产阶级世界观。只有学好、用好“老三篇”，才能在斗私的战场上打胜仗，在批修的火线上立新功。代表们认为：要做彻底的革命派，就要自觉地把斗私批修提到两条路线斗争的高度。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是无产阶级和劳动人民的生命线，也是办好毛泽东思想大学校的生命线。路线斗争，是贯穿一切、决定一切的大问题，路线斗争的觉悟，是最根本的觉悟。在两条路线斗争的关键时刻过得硬，这是无产阶级革命战士最可贵的品质，最高的智慧，最大的勇敢，最根本的“公”，最过硬的本领。办好毛泽东思想大学校，就是要培养出千千万万无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的钢铁战士。
　  用毛泽东思想挂帅，继承和发扬我军的革命传统，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，是办好毛泽东思想大学校必须遵循的根本原则。
    代表们通过对中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿在后勤建设中推行的见物不见人的反革命修正主义路线的大批判，更深刻地认识到林彪副主席关于突出政治的指示的伟大意义，进一步认识到，政治工作是管思想，管灵魂，管革命化的，是各行各业的总管。突出无产阶级政治，坚持政治统帅业务，是毛主席一贯的建军思想，也是后勤建设的根本方向。代表们指出，在后勤工作中，最大的战斗力，不是钱，不是物，不是技术，而是人，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。有了这样的人，就可以创造一切，掌握一切，改变一切，决定一切。我们就是要紧紧抓住这个方向，坚持突出无产阶级政治，用最大的精力做好人的思想政治工作，坚持用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装全体人员的头脑，把我军建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，投身到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命实践中去，是办好毛泽东思想大学校的根本途径。
    代表们认为，只有投身到三大革命实践中去，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手，跟上毛泽东思想的伟大新时代。毛主席决定我军参加“三支”“两军”工作，是使我们在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，把军学、军农、军工、军民这几项都兼起来的伟大战略措施。许多来自“三支”“两军”第一线的代表深有体会地说：火热的阶级斗争，是办好毛泽东思想大学校的最好课堂。在这个大课堂里，带着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的问题活学活用毛泽东思想，学习的内容最丰富，触及灵魂最深刻，效果最显著。代表们说：遵照毛主席“五·七”指示的精神，后勤各行各业，根据有主有从的原则，一业为主，兼学别样，不仅创造了大量的物质财富，更重要的是大大促进了人的思想革命化和总后勤部系统的组织革命化。代表们强调指出：阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命实践，是培养共产主义新人的大熔炉。只有在这个熔炉里，才能真正炼出有鲜明的阶级观点，牢固的群众观点，坚强的劳动观点，能文能武，亦兵亦农亦工的共产主义新人。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决地不折不扣地全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是办好毛泽东思想大学校的根本保证。
    代表们一致表示：要大力发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，大办、办好有战士、工人参加的毛泽东思想学习班。坚决贯彻支左不支派的原则，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
    出席大会的全体代表，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，通过了给毛主席的致敬信。大会还通过了给总后勤部全体指战员、革命职工、家属的倡议书。
    大会树立了九个先进集体和四个先进个人为总后勤部学习毛主席著作的标兵。他们是：毛主席的好战士年四旺；汽车某团三营副教导员李显文等十位烈士；汽车某团六连；三五一六工厂；某军马二场马三队；工建某团副连长黄清井等抗洪勇士；卡集拉兵站；汽车某团“川藏线上的钢铁运输班”；工建某团党委；三五○二工厂技术研究室；某军马场牧工七十三；工建某团六连班长侯朝文；工建某团十四连连长张万财。
    中央军委副主席聂荣臻、中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武出席了大会。总后勤部负责人邱会作、张池明、张令彬、张贤约、张天云等参加了大会。邱会作在会上作了题为《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，大力办好毛泽东思想大学校》的报告。张池明作了总后勤部活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的总结报告。
