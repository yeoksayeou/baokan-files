The revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses of the Tianjin Division of the Beijing Railway Bureau are firmly carrying out the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, launching a wave of "grasp revolution, promote production," and the entire bureau's revolution and production are presenting a vigorous and prosperous situation.

The Tianjin Railway Bureau's jurisdiction covers railways from Shanhaiguan in the north to Dezhou in the south, serving as a transportation hub connecting the areas inside and outside the Great Wall and the north and south of the motherland. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers actively responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," ensuring the smooth passage of trains coming from the south and going to the north, and never allowing differences in views to affect production. Recently, this bureau has established a revolutionary committee at the division level on the basis of achieving revolutionary great alliance in more than 90% of the grassroots units. The broad revolutionary masses have applied the revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to production, launching a production upsurge to ensure the completion of transportation plans. The broad masses of workers in the engineering department of the entire bureau have carried out a mass inspection of the lines to welcome the busy transportation tasks before and after the Spring Festival.

    天津铁路分局所辖铁路线北到山海关南到德州，是贯通长城内外和祖国南北的运输枢纽。广大革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命运动中积极响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，保证南来北往的列车畅通无阻，从来没有因为观点不同而影响生产。最近，这个分局在所属百分之九十以上的基层单位已按班组实现革命大联合的基础上，正式成立了分局的革命委员会。广大革命群众把在无产阶级文化大革命运动中焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产上，掀起了保证完成运输计划的生产热潮。全局工务部门广大职工展开了群众性的线路大检查，以迎接春节前后的繁忙运输任务。
