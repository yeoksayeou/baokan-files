The heroic military and civilian people of the Quang Nam-Da Nang region in South Vietnam have achieved significant victories in recent fierce battles.

According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, from January 30 to February 9, over a period of eleven days, they continuously fought, attacking six enemy military facilities from military headquarters to military sub-districts, as well as dozens of military outposts. They annihilated over 6,500 enemy troops, including nearly 2,000 American invaders and their mercenaries.

Among the enemy forces annihilated by the people's liberation armed forces were a fully destroyed enemy battalion and nearly twenty companies (two companies of American troops and one company of South Korean mercenaries), and a severely damaged puppet regiment.

In addition, the people's liberation armed forces also shot down and destroyed nearly 200 enemy aircraft, destroyed and damaged more than 200 tanks, armored vehicles, and other military vehicles, destroyed and burned dozens of ammunition and fuel depots, and liberated vast rural areas around Da Nang and other towns.

The report states that in the early hours of January 30, the artillery units of the liberation army simultaneously launched a fierce bombardment on the American air base, fuel depots, missile launch sites, radar stations, American logistics warehouses, and artillery positions around Da Nang. They destroyed 70 enemy aircraft, and the enemy's eight missile launchers and radar systems were all destroyed. Hundreds of American invaders were annihilated. The fuel depot was hit by shells, and the flames illuminated half the sky.

Additionally, in the early hours of February 1 and 3, the artillery units of the liberation army bombarded Da Nang Airport twice, destroying 26 enemy aircraft.

At 1 a.m. on January 31, the people's liberation armed forces attacked and annihilated a company of South Korean mercenaries stationed in An Nhon. In the early hours of January 30 and February 6, the artillery of the liberation army bombarded the Chu Lai Airport twice, killing 247 American invaders and destroying 87 aircraft.
