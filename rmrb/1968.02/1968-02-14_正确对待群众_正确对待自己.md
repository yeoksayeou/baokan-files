	Correctly Treat the Masses and Correctly Treat Oneself
	Deputy Director of the Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Chengming

	To properly handle the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses.

	I am the former deputy director of the Beijing Knitting Factory. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I stood on the wrong side and executed the bourgeois reactionary line, receiving criticism and attacks from the revolutionary masses. My thoughts were not clear. Later, with the help of the support-left personnel from the People's Liberation Army's 8341 Unit and the revolutionary workers of the factory, through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, I gained a deeper understanding of my mistakes and returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In mid-November last year, our factory established a revolutionary committee, and I was elected as the deputy director.

	In the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply felt that only by listening to Chairman Mao, correctly treating the masses, correctly treating oneself, and properly handling the relationship between the individual and the masses, can one follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, stay with the masses, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I did not act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. At that time, I did not understand, was not serious about, and was not effective in this great revolutionary movement. I thought that the Cultural Revolution was a matter for the cultural sector and had nothing to do with me, a worker from a humble background. Therefore, I rarely read the big-character posters put up by the workers in the factory, let alone join the masses in revolution. Later, two mass organizations emerged in the factory. One was more conservative in thought, and I thought it was more "disciplined," so I supported them. The other had a strong revolutionary spirit, but I did not like it and suppressed them. This faction of workers came to talk to me, seriously saying, "Old Zhang, don't take the wrong path. You should listen to Chairman Mao and stand with the revolutionary masses!" At that time, I did not listen and had a rebellious attitude.

	Because I initially stood on the opposite side of the revolutionary masses and on the bourgeois reactionary line, the masses naturally criticized and attacked me. The more the masses criticized and attacked me, the more I felt wronged. When the masses put up big-character posters about me, I refuted them and openly argued with the masses. Just at this time, my child who works in the army came home on leave. Seeing me in this state, he said I was wrong. He repeatedly told me about Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly treating the mass movement and inspired me to raise my problems to the level of the struggle between the two lines. This touched my thoughts. I thought, as a Communist Party member, one should struggle for the interests of the people. The broad revolutionary masses responded to Chairman Mao's call and opened fire on a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, while I became an obstacle. How could I face Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses? But then I thought, all these years, I have been working hard for the Party and the people, even if I have no merits, I have at least toiled. Why don't the masses see this? Because I had not fundamentally changed my attitude towards the masses, my thoughts could not turn around. During this period, my mood was very low, and I vowed never to be a cadre again.

	In late August last year, I participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the factory. Under the patient guidance and help of the support-left personnel from the 8341 Unit, I studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and tactics for revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and my mind gradually became clear. On the peasant movement, Mao said: "All revolutionary parties and comrades will be tested by them and will decide whether to abandon or adopt. Will they stand at the forefront leading them? Or will they stand behind them criticizing them? Or will they stand against them? Every Chinese person has the freedom to choose among these three, but the situation will force you to choose quickly." I linked my active thoughts with the actual struggle of the Cultural Revolution and repeatedly studied Mao's teachings, feeling particularly close to them. I used Mao's teachings to repeatedly compare my attitude and understanding of the mass movement, feeling that I was indeed wrong. I began to realize that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary mass movement. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, broke through the numerous obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, exposed China's Khrushchev and his handful of agents, and thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionists' plot to restore capitalism in China in terms of ideology, theory, politics, and organization. This greatly promoted the revolutionary process of China and the world, creating unprecedented great achievements in the history of the proletarian revolution. In such a great revolutionary mass movement, the broad revolutionary masses' direction of struggle is completely correct. A revolutionary cadre should stand among the masses and make revolution with the masses, but I stood on the opposite side of the masses and suppressed the masses. Just for this reason, I should be criticized and attacked by the masses.

	Our factory has an old worker named Wang Dianzong, who is from a poor peasant family and is a Communist Party member. In the early days of the movement, when he criticized me, I asked him, "What grudge do you have against me? Why do you treat me like this?" Wang Dianzong said, "I am not holding a grudge against you. I am criticizing your wrong thoughts. Why do you always oppose the masses?" In the past, I did not understand these words at all; they went in one ear and out the other. Now I began to understand. I went to him to exchange views. I said, "Old Wang, in the past, all the mistakes were mine for not listening to Chairman Mao. The revolutionary masses attacking me is to pull me onto Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The attack is right and good! I hope you will help me more in the future." Wang Dianzong also said excitedly, "We are all bitter gourds on the same vine, all class brothers. You took the wrong path, and how could we watch you slip down? We criticized you because we hate to see iron not become steel. I hope you will remember Chairman Mao's teachings in the future, always be with the masses, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life." These words are so good! To make mistakes and blame others is so wrong! Thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, looking at the masses, and reflecting on myself, I felt more and more that I had let Chairman Mao down and let the masses down. I wished I could pour out all my wrong thoughts to the masses. Therefore, I first made a thorough self-criticism in the Mao Zedong Thought study class and then to all the workers in the factory, asking the masses to further criticize and help me. I expressed my determination to be a student of the masses and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China, my mind became even clearer. Chairman Mao teaches: "To properly handle the relationship between superiors and subordinates and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses." My past mistakes were because I did not act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. From where I fell, I will rise again. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I and the other former deputy director, Comrade Cheng Yucai, went deep into the workshops to solicit opinions from the worker masses and accept the masses' education. Wherever we went, the masses patiently helped us and enthusiastically encouraged us. Some worker comrades said, "In the past, you made mistakes, but now you have awakened and decided to change. We welcome you!" Some worker comrades said, "You coming down like this and correcting your attitude towards the masses is right!" Some worker comrades also gave us "Three Articles," encouraging us to listen to Chairman Mao's words and change our thoughts. The words of the worker comrades moved us greatly and gave us a great enlightenment.

	In the past, as the deputy director of the main factory, I often had sub-factory directors report to me and rarely listened to the opinions of the masses or consulted with the masses. Reviewing Chairman Mao's teachings on improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, I further realized that cadres maintaining extensive and close contact with the masses is not a general issue but a fundamental matter in the socialist system. Whether to be an official or a servant of the people, to be a student of the masses, is not a matter of work method but a matter of fundamental stance, fundamental attitude, and worldview. The process of going deep among the masses and maintaining close contact with them is also a process of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, making a revolution in the depths of the soul. Why did I separate from the masses and argue with them in the past? In the end, it was because my worldview was not transformed, and there was a "self" in my mind.

	I deeply feel that whether a leading cadre can properly handle the relationship between oneself and the masses and correctly treat the masses is a matter of whether one can follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life. I am determined to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism for life, be a student of the masses for life, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life!

    正确对待群众　正确对待自己
    北京针织总厂革命委员会副主任　张成明
    要很好地解决上下关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。
                                    毛泽东
    我是北京针织总厂的原副厂长。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我曾经站错了队，执行过资产阶级反动路线，受到了革命群众的冲击，思想一直不通。后来，在中国人民解放军八三四一部队支左人员和工厂革命职工的帮助下，通过活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，我对自己的错误有了较深刻的认识，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了。去年十一月中旬，我们厂成立了革命委员会，我被选为副主任。
    在文化大革命的斗争实践中，我深深体会到，只有听毛主席的话，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，摆正个人和群众的关系，才能紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”我在无产阶级文化大革命初期，没有按照毛主席的教导去做。当时，我对这场伟大的革命运动，很不理解，很不认真，很不得力。我那时认为，文化大革命是文化界的事，跟我这个工人出身的大老粗没有什么关系。所以，对厂里工人群众贴的大字报很少去看，更谈不上和群众一起革命了。后来，厂里出现了两个群众组织。一个思想较保守，我觉得“规矩些”，就支持了他们；另一个革命造反精神很强，我却看不惯，还压制他们。这一派工人就找我谈话，语重心长地跟我说：“老张，你不要走错了路，你要听毛主席的话，和革命群众站在一起！”当时，我听不进去，有抵触情绪。
    由于我一开始就站到了革命群众的对立面，站到资产阶级反动路线上去了，群众当然要批判、冲击我。当时群众越批判我、冲击我，我心里越不服气。群众给我贴大字报，我就反驳，公开和群众顶牛。正在这个时候，在部队工作的孩子探家来了。他一看我这么个劲头，就说我错了。他向我反复讲毛主席关于正确对待群众运动的教导，并且启发我把自己的问题提到两条路线斗争的纲上来认识，对我的思想有所触动。我想，共产党员是为人民的利益奋斗的，广大革命群众响应毛主席的号召，向党内一小撮走资派开火，而自己却成了绊脚石，这怎么能对得起毛主席和广大革命群众呢？可是，又转念一想：这么些年，我还是辛辛苦苦为党为人民工作的，没有功劳也有苦劳，群众怎么不看到这些呢？由于我对群众的态度没有根本转变，思想上还是扭不过弯来。在这段时间里，我的情绪很消沉，发誓一辈子再也不当干部了。
    去年八月底，我参加了厂里举办的毛泽东思想学习班。在八三四一部队支左人员的耐心启发和帮助下，我带着究竟应该怎样对待群众和群众运动的问题，重新学习了毛主席的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》和毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，脑子才逐渐清醒过来。对农民运动，毛主席说：“一切革命的党派，革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？每个中国人对于这三项都有选择的自由，不过时局将强迫你迅速地选择罢了。”我联系自己的活思想，联系文化大革命的斗争实际，反复学习毛主席的这些教导，感到特别亲切。我拿毛主席的教导，一遍又一遍地对照自己对待群众运动的态度和认识，我感到自己确实错了。我开始认识到，伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场空前伟大的革命群众运动。亿万革命群众奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重障碍，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫和他的一小撮代理人，从思想上、理论上、政治上、组织上彻底粉碎了反革命修正主义分子在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，大大地推进了中国和世界的革命进程，创造了无产阶级革命史上前所未有的丰功伟绩。在这样一个伟大的革命群众运动中，广大革命群众斗争的大方向是完全正确的。一个革命干部本应站在群众之中，和群众一道闹革命，而我却站在群众的对立面，压制了群众。就凭这一条，我就应该受到群众的批判和冲击。
    我们厂有个老工人，叫王殿宗，贫农出身，共产党员。运动初期在批判我的时候，我问他：“我跟你有什么仇呀？你对我这么个样子！”王殿宗说：“我不是跟你有仇，我是批你的错误思想，为什么你老跟群众对立呢？”过去，我对这些话一点也不理解，右耳进，左耳出。现在我开始明白了。我去找他交换意见。我说：“老王呀，过去，千错万错，都错在我没有听毛主席的话。革命群众冲击我，是想把我拉到毛主席的革命路线上来。冲得对，冲得好！今后希望你多帮助我。”王殿宗也很激动地说：“我们都是一条藤上的苦瓜，都是阶级兄弟。你站错了队，我们怎能看着你滑下去。我们批判你，是恨铁不成钢。希望你今后牢记毛主席的教导，永远和群众在一起，跟毛主席干一辈子革命。”这些话说得多好呀！自己犯了错误还怨别人，多不应该呀！想想毛主席的教导，看看群众，照照自己，我越想越觉得对不起毛主席，对不起群众，我恨不得把自己的错误思想一古脑儿向群众倒出来。于是，我先是在毛泽东思想学习班，然后又向全厂职工，痛痛快快地作了思想检查，请群众进一步批判帮助。我表示决心做群众的小学生，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    学习了毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的最新指示，我心里更亮堂了。毛主席教导说：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”自己过去犯错误就是因为没有按照毛主席的教导办事。从那儿跌倒，就从那儿爬起来。遵照毛主席的教导，我和原来的另一个副厂长程育才同志，深入到车间，向工人群众征求意见，接受群众的教育。我们走到那里，群众都耐心地帮助我们，热情地鼓励我们。有的工人同志说：“过去你们犯了错误，现在觉悟了，决心改，我们就欢迎！”有的工人同志说：“你们这样下来，端正对群众的态度，这就对了！”有的工人同志还给我们送了“老三篇”，鼓励我们好好听毛主席的话，改造思想。工人同志的这些话使我们很感动，使我们受到很大的启发。
    过去，我是总厂的副厂长，有事多是找分厂的厂长来汇报，很少听取群众的意见，同群众商量。重温毛主席关于搞好干部和群众关系的教导，我进一步认识到，干部同群众保持广泛、密切的联系，决不是一般性的问题，而是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事。是当官做老爷，还是做人民的勤务员，当群众的小学生，这不是一个工作方法问题，而是一个根本立场、根本态度问题，是世界观的问题。深入群众，密切联系群众的过程，也是一个斗私批修，在灵魂深处闹革命的过程。以前，我为什么脱离群众，和群众顶牛呢？说到底，就是世界观没有改造好，头脑里有个“私”字在作怪。
    我深深体会到，一个领导干部能不能摆正自己和群众的关系，正确对待群众，是能不能跟着毛主席干一辈子革命的问题。我决心贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，一辈子斗私批修，一辈子当群众的小学生，一辈子跟毛主席干革命！
