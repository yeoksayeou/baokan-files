	Inspired by the Spring Offensive of the Vietnamese people in South Vietnam, Palestinian guerrillas have intensified their combat and achieved successive victories. In the past half month, they have killed and wounded more than a hundred Israeli aggressors and launched dozens of attacks on the enemy's military, political, and industrial centers.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Damascus on the 17th, a responsible person from the Palestinian underground nationalist organization "Fatah" said in Damascus on the 17th to a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the Palestinian commando units, inspired by the Spring Offensive of the Vietnamese people in South Vietnam, have recently intensified their struggle against the Israeli aggressors in the Arab-Israeli occupied areas, achieving new victories both militarily and politically.

	He said: "According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of February, the Palestinian commando units killed about eighty Israeli soldiers and wounded more than sixty. They also destroyed a long section of Israeli oil pipelines and some factories and military vehicles."

	He continued: "The Palestinian commando units launch dozens of attacks every day on Israeli patrol units and the enemy's military, political, and industrial centers. They also bombarded the meeting hall of the Fama Military Camp in Jerusalem with a barrage of mortar and rocket fire, causing serious damage to the building. They also attacked the area near the Israeli capital Tel Aviv, hitting some of the enemy's military and industrial facilities, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties and losses."

	He said: "Our battles in the enemy-occupied areas have received increasingly strong support from the local Arab people. They often provide cover for our guerrilla fighters, which is a guarantee of our victories. We deeply understand Chairman Mao's teaching that the people's army is inseparable from the people like fish and water."

	He emphasized: "Under the strong support of the people, we are waging a people's war, smashing all so-called 'political solutions' conspiracies."

	A Palestinian commando who recently came from the Israeli-occupied areas said on the 16th to a Xinhua News Agency reporter here: "In the occupied areas, we heard from transistor radios the news of the new victories of the Vietnamese people in South Vietnam in their war against American aggression and for national salvation, which greatly inspired us, making us more determined to fight against the American and Israeli aggressors. The Vietnamese people in South Vietnam are a shining example for all oppressed peoples. We will fight like the Vietnamese people in South Vietnam to achieve a thorough victory in liberating our homeland."

	According to a report from Cairo newspapers on the 15th, the Palestinian guerrillas fought a fierce battle with Israeli troops in the Dead Sea region and near Tulkarm on the West Bank of the Jordan River on the 13th. The Israeli spokesman admitted on the 14th that Israeli soldiers suffered casualties in this fierce battle.

	The "Storm" commando unit recently issued a combat report stating that from the 5th to the 11th, the "Storm" commando unit launched several attacks within the occupied Palestinian territories, killing twenty-eight Israeli aggressors. Some Israeli soldiers were also wounded. The "Storm" commando unit also caused significant damage to some of Israel's military and industrial facilities.

	According to reports, under the heavy blows of the Palestinian guerrillas, the Israeli authorities are in great panic and have recently held several military meetings to discuss how to deal with the Palestinian people's patriotic armed struggle. Several Israeli newspapers worriedly said that the Palestinian guerrillas launched these attacks inspired by the Vietnamese revolutionaries.

    在越南南方军民新春大捷鼓舞下
    巴勒斯坦游击战士加强战斗连连奏捷
    半个月毙伤以色列侵略军一百多，并数十次袭击敌人的军事、政治和工业中心
    据新华社大马士革十七日电　巴勒斯坦地下民族主义组织“法塔赫”一位负责人十七日在大马士革对新华社记者说，巴勒斯坦突击队在越南南方军民新春大捷的鼓舞下，最近在阿拉伯以色列占领区，加强了反对以色列侵略者的战斗，在军事上和政治上取得了新的胜利。
    他说：“据不完全统计，在二月上半月，巴勒斯坦突击队打死以色列士兵约八十多人，打伤六十多人。他们还毁坏了大段以色列油管以及一些工厂和军用车辆。”
    他接着说：“巴勒斯坦突击队每天对以色列巡逻队和以色列的军事、政治和工业中心发动数十次袭击。他们还以阵雨般的迫击炮和火箭炮火力，轰击耶路撒冷法梅马军营的会场，使这个建筑物受到严重破坏。他们还袭击了以色列首都特拉维夫附近地区，击中了那里的一些军事和工业设施，使敌人遭到严重的伤亡和损失。”
    他说：我们在敌占区的战斗，得到那里的阿拉伯人民群众愈来愈大的支持。他们经常掩护我们的游击战士，这是我们取得胜利的保证。我们深刻地体会到毛主席关于人民军队同人民是鱼水不能分离的教导。
    他强调指出：“我们在人民强有力的支持下进行一场人民战争，粉碎了一切所谓‘政治解决’的阴谋。”
    一位最近从以色列占领区来的巴勒斯坦突击队员，十六日在这里对新华社记者说：“在敌占区，我们从半导体收音机中听到越南南方军民抗美救国战争取得新胜利的消息，受到极大的鼓舞，使我们更加坚定了反对美以侵略者的战斗意志。越南南方人民是一切被压迫人民的光辉榜样。我们要象越南南方人民一样，为取得解放我们家园的彻底胜利而斗争。”
    据开罗报纸十五日报道，巴勒斯坦游击队十三日在死海地区和约旦河西岸的图勒卡雷姆附近地区同以色列军队发生激战。以色列发言人十四日承认以色列士兵在这次激战中有伤亡。
      “暴风”突击队最近发表的战报说，从五日到十一日，“暴风”突击队在被占领的巴勒斯坦境内发动的几次袭击中，打死了二十八名以色列侵略军。还有一些以色列士兵被击伤。“暴风”突击队还使以色列的一些军事和工业设施受到重大损失。
    据报道，在巴勒斯坦游击队的沉重打击下，以色列当局十分恐慌，最近连续召开了几次军事会议，讨论如何对付巴勒斯坦人民的爱国武装斗争。几家以色列的报纸忧虑地说，巴勒斯坦游击队是受到越南革命者的鼓舞而发动这些袭击的。
