In the overwhelming Tet Offensive by the military and people of South Vietnam, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Tri Province launched a surprise attack on the important U.S. stronghold of Wei Village in the early hours of February 7, breaking through the enemy's defense line on Highway 9 and further tightening the siege around the U.S. base at Xishan, thus placing a large number of U.S. troops at Xishan in an even more precarious situation.

Wei Village is located at the western end of Highway 9, forming a "triangle" defense system with the Da Gan and Xiang Hua strongholds for the U.S. Marine Corps at Xishan. It is also the gateway to the U.S. base at Xishan.

In Wei Village, the enemy had built layer upon layer of fortified positions and stationed nearly a thousand U.S. special forces, making it the largest U.S. special forces stronghold in South Vietnam.

At 17:00 on February 6, the People's Liberation Armed Forces, with the strong support of the people, launched an attack on Wei Village. A barrage of artillery shells simultaneously struck the entire enemy defense system in the Xishan area. The Xishan airfield was immediately paralyzed. By 23:00, the fierce artillery fire of the People's Liberation Armed Forces had pinned down the enemy in Wei Village, Da Gan, and several nearby hilltop strongholds, rendering them immobile. Then, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched a three-pronged assault, like three sharp blades piercing deep into the enemy's positions.

On the southwest side of Wei Village, the first detachment of the People's Liberation Armed Forces split into several groups to attack. One group of soldiers quickly captured the enemy's bridgehead and then charged straight towards the enemy command post. The enemy hid in their fortifications and put up fierce resistance. However, the soldiers cleverly diverted the enemy's firepower and then closed in on the enemy command post. In an instant, a series of hand grenades and hand bombs exploded inside the enemy's stronghold. The enemy command post in Wei Village was captured. The victory flag was hoisted high on the roof of the enemy command post, greatly encouraging the soldiers to more bravely annihilate the enemy.

At the same time, another group of soldiers attacked and surrounded the enemy's various targets along the communication trenches, dividing the enemy into several small groups and then annihilating them one by one. The remaining enemy soldiers, frightened, scrambled into the bunkers. The soldiers used explosive packages to blow up the enemy's bunkers and continued to pursue and annihilate the enemy, fighting until the enemy was in complete disarray and began to surrender to the liberation forces.

While the first detachment was directly assaulting the enemy stronghold in Wei Village, the People's Liberation Armed Forces continued to heavily shell the enemy strongholds around Wei Village, preventing them from reinforcing the enemy inside Wei Village.

At this time, another group of the People's Liberation Armed Forces on the eastern side of Wei Village quickly destroyed the outer fortifications and then bravely charged into the central area of the Wei Village stronghold. In close coordination with other groups of soldiers, they captured another enemy concentration point.

At 1:35 AM on February 7, the liberation forces had already controlled two-thirds of the entire Wei Village stronghold. At this point, the remaining enemy soldiers had fled into the bunkers in the northern part of Wei Village, attempting to hold out and wait for reinforcements. However, the People's Liberation Armed Forces quickly split into two groups, tightly sealing off the exits of the bunkers, and then used explosives to blow open the enemy's last stronghold. At 2:15 AM, Wei Village was completely captured by the People's Liberation Armed Forces.

In this battle, the People's Liberation Armed Forces annihilated nearly a thousand enemy soldiers, captured more than a hundred, including one U.S. Army major, and seized all enemy weapons and military supplies, once again delivering a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors.

    溪山外围一场激战
    南越解放军攻克卫村敌军据点纪实
    在越南南方军民排山倒海的新春攻势中，广治省人民解放武装力量二月七日凌晨一举攻克了美国侵略军的重要据点卫村，突破了敌人九号公路防线，进一步缩紧了对溪山美军基地的包围，从而使溪山的大批美军陷于更加窘迫的处境。
    卫村位于九号公路西端，与达根和香化据点形成了美国海军陆战队在溪山的“三角”防御系统，也是溪山美军基地的门户。
    在卫村，敌人构筑了密密层层的坚固工事，并驻有美国特种部队近千名，成为美国强盗在南越最大的一个特种部队的巢穴。
    二月六日十七时，人民解放武装力量在人民的大力支援下向卫村发起进攻。一串串炮弹同时射向溪山地区敌人的整个防御系统。溪山机场随即陷于瘫痪。到二十三时，人民解放武装力量猛烈的炮火就把卫村、达根这两个据点和附近的几个高地上的敌人压得无法动弹。接着，人民解放武装力量就从三个方向，象三把利刃直插入敌人的阵地。
    在卫村西南面，人民解放武装力量第一分队分几路进攻。一路战士很快就占领了敌人的桥头堡，接着一直冲向敌人的指挥所。敌人躲在工事里顽抗。但战士们机智灵活地牵制住敌人的火力，然后逼近敌人的指挥所。顷刻间，在敌人这个巢穴里，响起了一阵阵手雷和手榴弹的猛烈爆炸声。卫村据点敌人的指挥所被攻克了。胜利的红旗在这个敌人指挥所的屋顶上高高升起，有力地鼓舞着战士们更勇猛地歼灭敌人。
    与此同时，另一路战士也沿着交通壕袭击和包围敌人的各个目标，把敌人分割成许多小块，而后逐块地予以歼灭。残存的敌人吓得纷纷钻进地堡里。战士们用炸药包炸毁了敌人的地堡，并继续追歼敌人，打得敌人丧魂落魄，纷纷向解放军投降。
    在第一分队直捣卫村据点敌巢的时候，人民解放武装力量继续猛烈炮轰卫村周围的敌人据点，使他们无法支援卫村据点里的敌人。
    这时候，卫村东面的另一路人民解放武装力量也迅速摧毁了据点外围的各个碉堡，然后勇猛地冲进卫村据点的中心区，在其他各路战士的紧密配合下，攻克了敌人的一个集中点。
    二月七日凌晨一点三十五分，解放军已控制了整个卫村据点的三分之二的地区。这时候，残存的敌人都逃进卫村北区的地堡里，妄图死守，等待救援。但是，人民解放武装力量已迅速地分成两路，紧紧地把地堡的出口封锁住，并且用炸药把敌人这个最后的地堡炸开了。二时十五分，卫村就已完全被人民解放武装力量所占领。
