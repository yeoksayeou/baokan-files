The newly established Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held its first plenary meeting of all committee members. The meeting decided to further expand and deepen the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the province. The goal is to make Gansu Province a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought and to build the provincial Revolutionary Committee into a strong command post for promoting Mao Zedong Thought.

Participants in this meeting included all members of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, leaders from the Lanzhou Military Region and Gansu Military District, representatives of the People's Liberation Army who are engaged in "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, and leaders of various mass organizations. They carefully studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and reviewed the one-year-plus battle history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The meeting concluded that the most fundamental task facing the provincial Revolutionary Committee at present is to further expand and deepen the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This task must be firmly grasped, persistently pursued, and resolutely carried out. It must be grasped tightly and not let go until results are achieved. If this task is successfully completed, everything else will fall into place, and all battles will be won; if this task is neglected, everything will be in vain, and progress will be impossible.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Conducting study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The meeting believed that conducting and conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the key to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. A new high tide of conducting study classes must be launched throughout the province. Every workshop in factories, every class in schools, every department in offices, every street in cities, and every commune and production team in rural areas must be turned into Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary committees at all levels must directly conduct these classes, set examples, achieve results, train cadres, and use key points to drive overall progress and guide the entire situation. All types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes must use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and "The Little Red Book" as the textbook, carry out self-criticism and rectify bourgeois and petty-bourgeois tendencies, and promote the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao. Experiences must be continuously summarized and exchanged, quality must be improved, and effectiveness must be emphasized.

The meeting believed that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the current major enemy obstructing the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the major enemy in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With the enemy at the gate, it must be defeated. Members of the Revolutionary Committee and leaders of mass organizations must take the lead in mobilizing the masses to launch a "people's war" to eliminate factionalism. Through this campaign, the revolutionary great alliance in all special districts and counties throughout the province will be further consolidated and developed. Factionalism must be defeated, and all cadres who should be liberated must be liberated to further promote the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

Attendees pointed out that to further expand and deepen the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and to make Gansu Province a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought, the key lies in the revolutionary transformation of the leadership cadre and in building the Revolutionary Committee into a strong command post for promoting Mao Zedong Thought. This requires:

Firstly, the provincial Revolutionary Committee must be turned into a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Members of the Revolutionary Committee, in addition to carrying out their work, participating in labor, and conducting investigations, must regularly have some members take turns participating in study classes. Each member of the Revolutionary Committee must become a leader in promoting Mao Zedong Thought, both as a force for the revolution and as an object of the revolution, consciously revolutionizing and diligently transforming their worldview.

Secondly, the Revolutionary Committee must rely on Great Leader Chairman Mao from above and the broad revolutionary masses from below. Each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be immediately studied, thoroughly understood, promptly disseminated, widely publicized, and resolutely implemented. The Revolutionary Committee must regularly and truthfully report the situation to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, seek instructions frequently, and report frequently, never acting arbitrarily or making decisions on their own. The Revolutionary Committee must trust the masses, rely on the masses, follow the mass line, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and accept and listen to the masses' supervision and criticism. The Revolutionary Committee must fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought.

Thirdly, the Revolutionary Committee must constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the situation, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and always direct the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. The Revolutionary Committee must continue to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly eliminate the revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi and his agent Wang Feng and others on all fronts.

Fourthly, the Revolutionary Committee must be a united and strong fighting collective with a unified ideology, establish a revolutionary style, and unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian party principles. The Revolutionary Committee must fully practice democracy, actively carry out criticism and self-criticism, maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unassuming style, and maintain a style of hard struggle. The Revolutionary Committee must do a good job of superior-subordinate and cadre-mass relations, and forever maintain the character of ordinary laborers.

This meeting also seriously discussed issues such as grasping the revolution to promote production, launching a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production, further developing support for the military and love for the people, and rectifying the Party organization.

After the meeting, members of the provincial Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great instruction to "politically take the lead, go among the masses, and work with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better," went to the grassroots level. They worked with the masses to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out self-criticism and rectify bourgeois and petty-bourgeois tendencies, and help and promote the smooth progress of revolutionary great alliances, revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations, revolutionary criticism and struggle, and revolutionizing and reforming at the grassroots level.

    把革委会办成大立毛泽东思想的指挥部
    甘肃革委会举行首次扩大会指出，要把活学活用毛泽东思想、全面落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动更深入开展下去，关键在于领导班子思想革命化
    新华社兰州十八日电　新诞生的甘肃省革命委员会，最近召开第一次全体委员扩大会议，决定在全省更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想、全面落实毛主席最新指示的伟大群众运动，把甘肃省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把省革命委员会建设成为大立毛泽东思想的坚强指挥部。
    参加这次会议的甘肃省革命委员会全体委员，兰州部队、甘肃省军区领导同志，参加“三支”“两军”工作的人民解放军指战员代表和各大群众组织的负责人，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，回顾了无产阶级文化大革命一年多来的战斗历程。会议认为，当前摆在省革命委员会面前的最根本的一条任务，就是要更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。这一条任务一定要坚定不移地抓，坚持不懈地抓，要抓紧抓狠，抓住不放，一抓到底，抓出成果。抓好这一条，就一通百通，百战百胜；丢掉这一条，就一空百空，寸步难行。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”会议认为，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，是全面落实毛主席最新指示的关键，必须在全省范围内继续掀起大办学习班的新高潮。要把工厂的每一个车间，学校的每一个班级，机关的每一个部门，城市的每一条街道，农村的每一个公社和生产队，都办成毛泽东思想学习班。各级革命委员会都要直接办，办出样子，办出成果，训练好骨干，以重点带动一般，指导全盘。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，都必须以毛主席的最新指示为纲，以“老五篇”为教材，开展斗私批修，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风。要不断总结交流经验，提高质量，讲究实效。
    会议认为，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是当前阻碍毛主席最新指示全面落实的大敌，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大敌。大敌当前，必须打倒。革委会成员和群众组织的负责人要带头发动群众，打一场围剿派性的“人民战争”。通过围剿派性，进一步巩固和发展全省各专区、县的革命大联合。要打倒派性，把应该解放的干部都解放出来，进一步促进革命的三结合。
    到会的同志指出，要把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动更加广泛深入地开展下去，把甘肃省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，关键在于领导班子的思想革命化，在于把革命委员会建设成为大立毛泽东思想的坚强指挥部。这就要求：首先要把省革命委员会办成一个毛泽东思想学习班。革委会成员除坚持工作，参加劳动，调查研究以外，要经常有一部分成员轮流在学习班参加学习。革委会每个成员，都要成为大立毛泽东思想的带头人，既要把自己作为革命的一份力量，又要不断地把自己作为革命的对象，自觉革命，刻苦地改造世界观。
    第二，革命委员会要上靠伟大领袖毛主席，下靠广大革命群众。对毛主席的每条最新指示，都要立即学习，认真领会，迅速传达，大力宣传，坚决照办。对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，要经常如实地反映情况，多请示，多报告，绝不自以为是，自作主张。要事事相信群众，依靠群众，走群众路线，尊重群众的首创精神，接受和听取群众的监督和批评，用毛泽东思想充分调动广大革命群众的积极性和创造性。
    第三，要经常用毛泽东思想观察分析形势，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资派。要继续深入开展革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人汪锋之流在各条战线上散布的修正主义流毒。
    第四，革命委员会必须是一个思想统一的坚强的战斗集体，树立革命化的作风，在毛泽东思想和无产阶级党性原则的基础上团结起来。革命委员会要充分发扬民主，积极开展批评与自我批评，保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，保持艰苦奋斗的作风。要搞好上下级关系和干群关系，永远保持普通劳动者的本色。
    这次会议还就抓革命促生产、掀起工农业生产新高潮，进一步开展拥军爱民活动，整顿党的组织等问题，进行了认真的讨论。
    会议结束后，省革委会的成员遵照毛主席关于“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的伟大教导，分头到基层，和群众一起大办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示，一起斗私批修，帮助和促进基层的革命大联合、革命三结合、革命大批判和斗批改的顺利进行。
