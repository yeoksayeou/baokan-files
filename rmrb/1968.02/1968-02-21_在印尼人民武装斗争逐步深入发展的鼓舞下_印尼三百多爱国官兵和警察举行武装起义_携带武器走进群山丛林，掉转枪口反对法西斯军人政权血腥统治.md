	Inspired by the deepening armed struggle of the Indonesian people, over 300 patriotic soldiers and policemen in Indonesia staged an armed uprising. They carried their weapons into the mountains and forests, turning their guns against the bloody rule of the fascist military regime.

	New China News Agency, February 20th: Jakarta News: Inspired by the deepening armed struggle of the Indonesian people, 330 patriotic soldiers and policemen stationed in Malang, East Java, staged an armed uprising on February 15th. They carried their weapons into the mountains and forests, turning their guns against the bloody rule of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. This is a severe blow to the reactionary military regime that brutally suppresses the people and indicates that the reactionary regime's rule is becoming increasingly unstable. According to Western news agencies, among the uprising forces, there are 100 navy personnel, 50 army personnel, 30 air force personnel, and 150 policemen (some marine corps members stationed in Surabaya also joined the uprising). According to Agence France-Presse, on the 15th, the patriotic soldiers and policemen who participated in the uprising "carried their weapons out of the barracks and openly betrayed the Suharto regime." The report said that this revolutionary action, jointly taken by patriotic soldiers and policemen from various different military branches, "occurred simultaneously, was obviously organized, and was well-coordinated." The Associated Press quoted an informed source from the Indonesian military, revealing that when these patriotic soldiers and policemen rushed out of the barracks, they had "engaged in several exchanges of fire with the reactionary authorities."

	According to reports, these patriotic soldiers and policemen have joined the people's armed forces active in the mountainous forests of East Java. The Associated Press said that this batch of uprising forces "has fled into the politically volatile forests of East Java." Agence France-Presse said that they "will join the Indonesian underground communists."

	The revolutionary action of Indonesian patriotic soldiers and policemen has struck fear into the hearts of the Indonesian fascist military regime. According to reports, the Indonesian reactionary authorities admitted that "this is a symbol of instability in many places in Indonesia" and are worried that "this situation will spread to other units."

	Since the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique established an unprecedentedly brutal fascist dictatorship in Indonesia, they have been massacring hundreds of thousands of communists and revolutionary people across the country, throwing tens of thousands of Indonesia's finest sons and daughters into prisons, and conducting purges within the army, navy, air force, and police forces. Many patriotic soldiers and policemen have been slaughtered and imprisoned. The Malang armed uprising is a resistance against the counter-revolutionary policies of anti-communism and anti-people pursued by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, and it also exposes the extremely weak essence of this fascist regime.

    在印尼人民武装斗争逐步深入发展的鼓舞下
    印尼三百多爱国官兵和警察举行武装起义
    携带武器走进群山丛林，掉转枪口反对法西斯军人政权血腥统治
    新华社二十日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚人民武装斗争逐步深入发展的鼓舞下，驻在东爪哇玛琅市的三百三十名印度尼西亚爱国官兵和警察，于二月十五日举行武装起义，携带武器走进群山丛林，掉转枪口起来反对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的血腥统治。这对残酷镇压人民的印尼反动军人政权是一个严重打击，同时表明，这个反动政权的统治地位越来越不稳定。据西方通讯社透露，在这批起义部队中，有一百名海军、五十名陆军、三十名空军和一百五十名警察（驻在泗水的一些海军陆战队成员参加了起义的行列）。据法新社报道，十五日，参加起义的爱国军警“携带武器离开兵营，公开背叛苏哈托政权”。消息说，由各个不同兵种的爱国官兵和警察联合采取的这一革命行动是“同时发生的，显然是有组织的，是配合好的”。美联社援引印尼军方消息灵通人士的话透露，这些爱国官兵和警察从兵营中冲杀出来时，曾同反动当局“发生过几次交火”。
    据报道，这些爱国官兵和警察已投奔活跃在东爪哇山区丛林中的人民武装力量。美联社说，这批起义部队“已经逃入政治上快要爆炸的东爪哇的森林里”。法新社说，他们“将与印尼地下共产党人联合起来”。
    印尼爱国官兵和警察的这一革命行动，吓得印尼法西斯军人政权丧魂落魄。据报道，印尼反动当局供认，“这是印尼许多地方不稳定的象征”，并担心“这种情况将扩大到其他部队”。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团在印尼建立空前残暴的法西斯专政以来，在全国各地疯狂屠杀几十万共产党人和革命人民，把几十万印尼人民的优秀儿女投进牢房，同时在陆海空和警察部队内部进行清洗，许多爱国官兵和警察被屠杀和监禁。玛琅武装起义，是对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权所推行的反共、反人民的反革命政策的反抗，同时也暴露了这个法西斯政权极其虚弱的本质。
