The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Wuhan troops have recently carefully summarized the experiences of the "three supports, two militaries" work in the previous stage. They believe that to do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, there are countless experiences, but the most fundamental one is to be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to go deep into the grassroots, to take root among the masses, and to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without distortion.

Putting the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the broad masses at the grassroots level at the forefront of all work

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Wuhan troops who are fighting on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries" have a deep personal understanding of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's extremely important instruction to grasp the grassroots and put grasping the grassroots in the first place. Initially, some units had focused their main efforts on working with the leaders of mass organizations, engaging in more activities at the upper levels, and not deeply rooted among the masses, resulting in slower progress in revolutionary great alliances. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, the Wuhan troops party committee summarized the experiences of the "three supports, two militaries" work in the previous stage. They realized that implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the upper-level leaders of mass organizations and among the broad masses at the grassroots level are both important, but the latter should be placed first. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots level and taking root among the masses is the fundamental direction of the "three supports, two militaries" work. Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an endless force, becoming a powerful spiritual atomic bomb. Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots level and taking root among the masses can not only guide the broad masses to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieve revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, and win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but also has profound significance for preventing revisionism and promoting the thought revolutionization of the people. Therefore, the Wuhan troops party committee put going deep into the grassroots, taking root among the masses, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all work. When arranging work, they first arrange for the broad masses to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions; when checking work, they first check the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots level; when summarizing work, they first summarize the experiences of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots level. A large number of leading cadres went deep into the grassroots, and thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams went deep into workshops, classes, communes, and streets, taking root among the masses, enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and working together with the broad masses to study, actively implement, and seriously carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In this way, Chairman Mao's latest instructions quickly became the conscious actions of the broad masses of the people, becoming a powerful material force.

Go to the grassroots, guide the broad revolutionary masses to learn and use Chairman Mao's latest instructions immediately and see results

The officers and soldiers realized that the broad revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao the most and love Mao Zedong Thought the most. As long as the broad revolutionary masses realize that whether or not to seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, they will seriously and quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively. Therefore, after the officers and soldiers went to the grassroots, they quickly took root among the masses. Through patient and detailed political and ideological work, they deepened the broad revolutionary masses' love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, guiding them to consciously learn and use Chairman Mao's latest instructions immediately and see results. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes and various large and small meetings, the officers and soldiers guided the broad revolutionary masses to conduct "four comparisons and four reflections," namely: to compare and reflect on the unprecedented good situation in the country, the region, and the unit, and to see the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought; to compare and reflect on the profound changes in the spiritual outlook of the masses, and to see the boundless power of great Mao Zedong Thought; to compare and reflect on the great achievements of criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and to see the extreme importance of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions; to compare and reflect on the profound influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the world revolution, and to see Chairman Mao's epoch-making great development of Marxism-Leninism. To recall the bitterness of the old society and compare it with the sweetness of liberation under Chairman Mao's leadership; to recall the bitterness of the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and compare it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; to recall the nurturing and growth of Mao Zedong Thought and compare it with one's own contributions to the revolution. Through the activities of comparing, reflecting, recalling, and contrasting, the broad revolutionary masses' deep class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought reached a new height. Thus, the broad revolutionary masses, with their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, learned and used Chairman Mao's latest instructions immediately and quickly implemented them. Some revolutionary mass organizations that were divided into two factions, who could not sit together in the past, now sit together; who could not reach an agreement in the past, now reach an agreement; long-standing differences are now united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, forming a lively scene of mutual learning, mutual assistance, mutual promotion, and common progress. Within the revolutionary faction of New Lake, there were previously serious differences. The responsible comrades of the troops and the stationed soldiers, together with the revolutionary masses of the two factions, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recalled and compared, recalling that they were all class brothers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, all close comrades who fought out of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and all comrades on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The more they recalled, the more they hated the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, the deeper their class feelings for Chairman Mao became, and the more intimate they felt towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary masses of the two factions realized: "Among countless principles, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao is the most fundamental; among countless mistakes, not acting according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the biggest mistake." The revolutionary masses of the two factions all seriously conducted self-criticism, eliminated differences, and united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Go to the grassroots, mobilize the masses to encircle and eliminate factionalism and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions

Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is an enemy that interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and obstructs the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and must be overthrown. How can this great enemy be overthrown? The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan troops deeply realized in practice: to deal with the enemy in the ideological realm, we must also wage a "people's war." Only in this way can the enemy of factionalism be drowned in the vast ocean and Chairman Mao's latest instructions deeply rooted among the masses. The left-supporting troops went deep into the grassroots and extensively mobilized the masses to study and use Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Five Articles" and his series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally raising the broad revolutionary masses' awareness of encircling and eliminating factionalism. Through study, the masses' understanding greatly improved. They regarded whether they could consciously resist and encircle factionalism as a matter of whether they implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, as a matter of whether they were loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. On this basis, the left-supporting troops helped the broad revolutionary masses to take "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, to set up a battlefield for encircling factionalism. They listed the crimes of factionalism, discussed the harm of factionalism, dug up the roots of factionalism in various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, in reporting meetings, in "one red" activities, and in various meetings, forming a hot tide of encircling factionalism throughout the province. The broad revolutionary masses strengthened their proletarian party spirit, not saying anything that was not conducive to the great alliance, not doing anything that was not conducive to the great alliance. Some leaders of several revolutionary organizations in the Wuhan Steel Company competed for the "core" and seats, affecting the realization of revolutionary great alliances. With the help of the left-supporting personnel of the People's Liberation Army, the broad revolutionary masses raised their awareness. They sent Chairman Mao's quotations and big-character posters to the leaders, helping the leaders to study and use Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Under the help and supervision of the revolutionary masses, these leaders criticized their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly realized the revolutionary great alliance and established the preparatory group for the revolutionary committee.

To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the grassroots level, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of supporting the left and not supporting factions

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the masses of the people. For Communist Party members, this means standing on the side of the Party, standing on the side of party spirit and Party policy." The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan troops deeply felt in the "three supports, two militaries" work that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the masses, it is necessary to firmly stand on the side of proletarian party spirit and adhere to the principle of supporting the left and not supporting factions. They resolutely did not participate in any meetings or activities with factionalism; regardless of which faction, they firmly supported anything that conformed to Mao Zedong Thought and did not support anything that did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically helped and patiently persuaded, doing painstaking and detailed political and ideological work, guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within the revolutionary factions onto the track of proletarian revolution. To strengthen the proletarian party spirit of the left-supporting personnel, prevent the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and consistently adhere to the principle of supporting the left and not supporting factions, the various levels of party committees of the Wuhan troops used Chairman Mao's "Old Five Articles" and latest instructions as weapons, took "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, regularly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, conducted small rectifications, regularly summarized experiences, commended advanced individuals, checked work, examined whether their thoughts conformed to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, whether their words and deeds conformed to the direction of the struggle, whether their work conformed to Party policy, and whether their attitude was that of a student of the masses, making the broad masses of left-supporting personnel continuously raise their awareness, keep up with the situation, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and do the "three supports, two militaries" work better.

    解放军武汉部队广大指战员认真总结“三支”“两军”工作经验
    无限忠于毛主席紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署到群众里面去条条落实毛主席的最新指示
    新华社武汉九日电　人民解放军武汉部队广大指战员最近认真总结了前一阶段“三支”“两军”工作的经验。他们认为，做好“三支”“两军”工作，经验有千条万条，最根本的一条，就是无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入基层，扎根群众，不走样地把毛主席的最新指示条条落到实处。
    把在基层广大群众中落实毛主席最新指示放在一切工作的首位
    人民解放军武汉部队战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员，对林彪副主席的要抓好基层，把抓基层放在第一位这个极为重要的指示，有着切身的体会。开始，有的部队曾经把主要精力放在做群众组织头头的工作上，在上层活动较多，扎根群众不够，结果革命大联合进展比较慢。毛主席最新指示下达后，武汉部队党委总结了前一阶段“三支”“两军”工作的经验。他们认识到，毛主席的最新指示在群众组织的上层头头中落实和在基层广大群众中落实，这两者都很重要，但是应该把抓基层放在第一位。把毛主席的最新指示落实到基层，扎根到群众，是“三支”“两军”工作的根本方向。毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。把毛主席的最新指示落实到基层，扎根到群众，不仅可以引导广大群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，实现革命大联合和革命三结合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，而且对防修反修和促进人民群众的思想革命化，都有深远的意义。因此，武汉部队党委把深入基层，扎根群众，落实毛主席最新指示放在一切工作的首位。布置工作，首先布置广大群众学习毛主席的最新指示；检查工作，首先检查毛主席的最新指示在基层的落实；总结工作，首先总结毛主席的最新指示在基层落实的经验。各级领导干部大批深入基层，数以千计的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到车间、班级、社队、街道，扎根到群众之中，热情宣传毛主席的最新指示，和广大群众一起努力学习、积极贯彻、认真落实毛主席的最新指示。这样，毛主席的最新指示迅速变为广大人民群众的自觉行动，变成了强大的物质力量。
    到基层去，引导广大革命群众对毛主席的最新指示学了就用，立竿见影
    指战员们认识到，广大革命群众最热爱毛主席，最热爱毛泽东思想。只要使广大革命群众认识到，是否认真落实毛主席的最新指示，是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的根本态度问题，他们就会认真地、迅速地条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。因此，指战员们来到基层后，都迅速扎根到群众中，通过耐心细致的思想政治工作，更加加深广大革命群众对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的热爱，引导他们自觉地对毛主席的最新指示学了就用，立竿见影。指战员们在毛泽东思想学习班里，在各种大小会上，引导广大革命群众进行“四摆四看”、“三忆三比”。即：大摆全国、本地区和本单位空前未有的大好形势，看毛泽东思想的伟大胜利；大摆人民群众精神面貌的深刻变化，看伟大的毛泽东思想无穷无尽的威力；大摆斗私批修的巨大成果，看落实毛主席最新指示的极端重要；大摆无产阶级文化大革命对世界革命的深远影响，看毛主席对马克思列宁主义划时代的重大发展。忆旧社会的苦，比毛主席领导自己翻身解放的甜；忆中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜；忆毛泽东思想对自己的哺育成长，比自己对革命的贡献。通过摆、看、忆、比活动，广大革命群众对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情，提到了一个新的高度。于是，广大革命群众怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，对毛主席的最新指示学了就用，迅速落实。一些分成两派的革命群众组织的群众，过去坐不到一起，现在坐在一起了，过去谈不拢，现在谈得拢了，长期存在的分歧，现在在毛泽东思想的基础上统一起来了，形成了互相学习，互相帮助，互相促进，共同提高，亲密无间的生动局面。新湖大无产阶级革命派内部，过去存在着严重分歧。部队负责同志和驻校的解放军，就和两派的革命群众一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起回忆对比，忆出了彼此都是毛泽东思想哺育成长的阶级兄弟，都是从资产阶级反动路线下冲杀出来的亲密战友，都是毛主席无产阶级革命路线上的同志，大家越忆对资产阶级反动路线越恨，越忆对毛主席的阶级感情越深，越忆对毛主席的最新指示越亲切。两派的革命群众认识到：“千条万条，无限忠于毛主席是最最根本的一条；千错万错，没有按毛主席最新指示办事是最大的错”，两派的革命群众都认真作了自我批评，消除了分歧，在毛泽东思想的基础上团结了起来。
    到基层去，发动群众围剿派性全面落实毛主席的最新指示
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是干扰毛主席伟大战略部署，阻碍毛主席最新指示条条落实的敌人，必须打倒。怎样才能把这个大敌打倒？伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”武汉部队广大指战员在实践中深刻地认识到：对付思想领域里的敌人，也要打一场“人民战争”，只有这样，才能使派性这个敌人陷于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海之中，使毛主席的最新指示在群众中深深扎根。支左部队深入广泛地发动群众大学大用毛主席的光辉著作“老五篇”和关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，从根本上提高广大革命群众围歼派性的自觉性。通过学习，广大群众的认识大大提高，他们把能不能自觉地抵制和围歼派性，看作是执行不执行毛主席最新指示的问题，看作是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线忠不忠的问题。在此基础上，支左部队又帮助广大革命群众以“斗私，批修”为纲，大摆围歼派性的战场。他们在各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班里，在讲用会上，在“一对红”活动中，在各种会议上，大列派性的罪状，大谈派性的危害，大挖派性的根子，在全省范围内形成了一个围剿派性的热潮。广大革命群众增强了无产阶级党性，对不利于大联合的话不说，不利于大联合的事不做。武汉钢铁公司几个革命组织的某些头头，争“核心”，争席位，影响革命的大联合不能实现。在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，广大革命群众提高了觉悟，他们就给头头送毛主席语录，送大字报，帮助头头活学活用毛主席的最新指示。在革命群众的帮助和督促下，这些头头狠批自己的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，迅速实现了革命大联合，成立了革委会筹备小组。
    要使毛主席最新指示在基层落实，必须坚持支左不支派的原则
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”武汉部队广大指战员在“三支”“两军”工作中，深深体会到：要使毛主席的最新指示在群众中落实，就必须坚定不移地站在无产阶级党性的立场上，坚持支左不支派的原则。他们对带有派性的会议和各种活动坚决不参加；不管是那一派，凡是符合毛泽东思想的就坚决支持，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的就不支持，就热情帮助，耐心说服，做艰苦细致的思想政治工作，把革命派内部的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。为了增强支左人员的无产阶级党性，防止资产阶级、小资产阶级派性影响，始终不渝地坚持支左不支派的原则，武汉部队各级党委以毛主席的“老五篇”和最新指示为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，经常开办毛泽东思想学习班，开门小整风，定期总结经验，表扬先进，检查工作，查自己的思想是否符合毛主席的最新指示，查自己的言行是否符合斗争大方向，查自己的工作是否符合党的政策，查自己的态度是否甘当群众小学生，使广大支左人员不断提高觉悟，跟上形势，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好。
