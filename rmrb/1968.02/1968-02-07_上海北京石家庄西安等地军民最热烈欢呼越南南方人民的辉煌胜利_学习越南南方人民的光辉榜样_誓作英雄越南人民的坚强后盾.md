People of Shanghai, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Xi'an and other places have been holding meetings and various celebrations in recent days, warmly celebrating and congratulating the glorious victory of the people of South Vietnam in the anti-American national salvation war. They expressed their determination to learn from the heroic people of Vietnam, who dare to fight, fear no sacrifice, and bravely face any danger, and to firmly support the Vietnamese people in their struggle to achieve final victory.

Many factories in Shanghai, including the Dongfanghong Shipyard, Donghai Shipyard, Shanghai Bicycle Factory, Shanghai Tractor Factory, Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Shanghai Gear Factory, and Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, have been holding meetings and various celebrations, posting large red banners to warmly celebrate and congratulate the glorious victory of the people of South Vietnam in the anti-American national salvation war.

Many workers and revolutionary masses in these factories pointed out at the meetings that the glorious victory of the people of South Vietnam in the anti-American national salvation war fully demonstrates the immense power of people's war.

They unanimously declared: The people of Shanghai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will stand with the people of the whole country as a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war through to the end.

Vietnamese trainees in Shanghai, filled with excitement, joined the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary cadres in celebrating the victory. The Vietnamese trainees said at the meeting with great joy: In the midst of the triumphant songs of the New Year's great victory, we received the news that Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, warmly congratulated the great victory in the anti-American national salvation war. This is the greatest support and encouragement for us.

Today, the Beijing Zhong-Yue Friendship People's Commune and the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University held separate victory celebration meetings to celebrate the great victory of the people of South Vietnam. Members of the Zhong-Yue Friendship People's Commune said at the meeting, "We poor and lower-middle peasants will learn from the revolutionary spirit of our Vietnamese brothers and sisters, who dare to fight, dare to win, and fear no sacrifice. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promote revolution and production, and support our Vietnamese brothers and sisters in achieving new and even greater victories with our actual work in spring ploughing and production.

Today, 100,000 military and civilian personnel in Shijiazhuang held a rally and parade to warmly celebrate the New Year's great victory of the people of South Vietnam. Li Xuefeng, Zheng Weishan, and Liu Zihou, leaders of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee, Beijing Military Region troops, as well as leaders of the Hebei Military Region and Hebei garrison troops, attended the celebration meeting. Lu Yulan, a member of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee, said on behalf of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee that the New Year's great victory of South Vietnam once again proves the correctness of our great leader Chairman Mao's assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. She declared that the people of Hebei will definitely stand with the people of the whole country as a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war through to the end.

Workers and students from Xi'an region said at the victory celebration meeting that the new victories achieved in the Vietnamese anti-American national salvation war are not only the victories of the Vietnamese people but also the victories of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the whole world. They have set a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world to achieve liberation. We, the people of Xi'an, will definitely grasp the revolution, promote production, and support our Vietnamese brothers and sisters with actual actions, giving the American imperialists even heavier blows.
