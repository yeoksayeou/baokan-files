Workers Must Be Exemplary in Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

The Revolutionary Workers' Congress of Guizhou Province was successfully held.

Comrade Li Zaihan pointed out at the meeting that as the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class listens most to Chairman Mao's words and must make new contributions in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou, January 30th — The Revolutionary Workers' Congress of Guizhou Province was successfully held from January 20th to 25th.

This congress is a rallying call for the working class of Guizhou to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement and carry out the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. More than 3,000 revolutionary workers from all ethnic groups representing industries, transportation, basic construction, finance and trade, agriculture and forestry from seven prefectures, autonomous regions, and over 80 counties and cities across the province attended the meeting. They studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and the New Year's editorials from the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily with deep class feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. The representatives reviewed and summarized the workers' movement in Guizhou based on Chairman Mao's latest instructions, affirmed the achievements, identified the gaps, implemented measures, and unanimously passed a resolution to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The meeting, amidst thunderous applause, unanimously passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, elected the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of Guizhou Province, and passed an appeal to all revolutionary workers in the province.

Leaders from the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and the Guizhou Military Region, including Li Zaihan, Zhang Ming, Li Li, He Guangyu, Shi Xin'an, and Sun Changde, attended the meeting. Li Zaihan, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The reactionary bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois factionalism are the major enemies on the path of the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary faction of the proletariat must resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthen proletarian party spirit. As the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class listens most to Chairman Mao's words and must unconditionally and practically implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to contribute to the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization. Comrade Luo Xikang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province and a leader of the Guizhou Provincial Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Command, stressed in his report at the meeting that everything must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought, achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking, strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the working class, and make the working class a force that is extremely proletarian, extremely militant, extremely revolutionary, and full of vigor under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, extremely loyal to Chairman Mao, extremely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and extremely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the new year, all revolutionary workers in the province must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, work hard, strive for the best, and continue to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

The representatives attending the meeting reviewed the great achievements made by the broad masses of revolutionary workers in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said that every step forward we take is due to the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; every victory we achieve is the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the result of the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. In the new year, we must take the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of the workers' movement, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the action program of the workers' movement, arm the workers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking. We must unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, honestly follow, always follow, and follow generation after generation. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," we must ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented and become models in learning, implementing, propagating, and defending the latest instructions.

The representatives unanimously agreed that the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a process of arduous struggle. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing victoriously, and the class enemies will not be reconciled to their failure. They will continue to adopt more treacherous, cunning, and vicious means to sabotage and disrupt. The working class must heighten its revolutionary vigilance and be ready at any time to give a devastating blow to the class enemies who sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representatives also believe that the obstacles to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions come from the "selfish" thoughts in the minds of some comrades within the working class. To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must have a loyal heart, grasp the use, break the selfishness, and establish the public spirit. We must thoroughly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and uphold proletarian party spirit.

On the afternoon of the 25th, over 100,000 workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards from the Guizhou region, together with the more than 3,000 representatives attending the meeting, held a grand gathering to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of Guizhou Province and resolved to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    工人阶级要做落实毛主席最新指示的模范
    贵州省革命职工代表大会胜利召开。李再含同志在会上指出，作为无产阶级文化大革命主力军的工人阶级，最听毛主席的话，一定要在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中作出新贡献。
    据新华社贵阳三十日电　贵州省革命职工代表大会于一月二十日到二十五日胜利举行。
    这次大会，是贵州工人阶级高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实、全面贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示的誓师大会。来自全省七个专区、自治州、八十多个县、市的工业、交通、基本建设、财贸、农林等战线的三千多名各族革命职工代表，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，认真学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论。代表们根据毛主席的最新指示，对贵州工人运动进行了检查和总结，肯定了成绩，找出了差距，落实了措施，一致通过了全面落实毛主席最新指示的决议。
    大会在暴风雨般的掌声中，一致通过了给我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电，选举产生了贵州省革命职工代表大会常设委员会，通过了给全省革命职工的倡议书。
    贵州省革命委员会、贵州省军区负责人李再含、张明、李立、何光宇、石新安、孙昌德等出席了大会。贵州省革命委员会主任委员李再含同志在会上讲了话。他强调指出，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证。反动的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是目前无产阶级文化大革命前进路上的大敌。无产阶级革命派一定要坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，加强无产阶级党性。作为无产阶级文化大革命主力军的工人阶级，最听毛主席的话，一定要不折不扣地、踏踏实实地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，为从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出新的贡献。贵州省革命委员会常委、省工人革命造反指挥部负责人罗锡康，在大会上所作的报告中强调要用毛泽东思想指导一切，实现人的思想革命化，加强工人阶级队伍的思想建设和组织建设，使她成为在中国共产党的领导之下，无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线，非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化、非常革命化和朝气蓬勃的工人阶级队伍。在新的一年中，全省革命职工要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席最新指示为纲，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    出席会议的代表回顾了广大革命职工在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中取得的伟大成就。他们说，我们每前进一步，都是由于毛主席的革命路线的指引；每取得一个胜利，都是战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，都是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部领导的结果。在新的一年里，要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为工人运动的灵魂，以毛主席最新指示为工人运动的行动纲领，用毛泽东思想武装工人的头脑，实现人的思想革命化。对毛主席的最新指示要不折不扣地执行，要老老实实地跟，永远跟，代代跟。要以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，使毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，争当学习最新指示，执行最新指示，宣传最新指示，捍卫最新指示的模范。
    代表们一致认为，落实毛主席最新指示的过程，是一个艰巨斗争的过程。无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利向前发展，阶级敌人决不甘心于自己的失败，他们还会采取更阴险、更狡猾、更毒辣的手段继续进行破坏和捣乱，工人阶级要提高革命警惕性，随时准备给破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阶级敌人以毁灭性的打击。代表们还认为，全面落实毛主席最新指示的阻力，还来自工人阶级队伍里一些同志头脑里的“私”字。要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，就要心怀一个“忠”字，狠抓一个“用”字，大破一个“私”字，大立一个“公”字，就要把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性彻底打倒，坚持无产阶级党性。
    二十五日下午，贵阳地区工农兵和红卫兵革命小将十万多人，与参加大会的三千多名代表一起举行大会，热烈庆祝贵州省革命职工代表大会胜利闭幕，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
