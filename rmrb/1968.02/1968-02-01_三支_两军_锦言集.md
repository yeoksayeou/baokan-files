Chairman Mao thinks of the masses, loves the masses, and wholeheartedly serves the masses. Chairman Mao and the masses share a bond. To love Chairman Mao, we must love the masses.

	To be in harmony with the masses, we must be sincere with them.
	The masses see everything we do most clearly. We should invite the masses to evaluate us, as they have the most authority to speak. If the masses approve, we should persist; if the masses criticize correctly, we should immediately correct our mistakes.
	The masses are the brightest mirror. Only by going among the masses can we truly see ourselves.
	In the intense class struggle, we must establish schools of Mao Zedong Thought, with the largest classrooms, daring to go through trials; the most teachers, willing to be humble students; and the hardest exams, answering with Mao Zedong Thought.
	To achieve the thought revolutionization of the army, we must place the army in the "wind" and "waves" of class struggle to "transform" it, so that it can be thoroughly and deeply transformed.
	In this new historical period, the army must not only be a steel wall in military terms to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat but also a steel wall in political and ideological terms to prevent and oppose revisionism.

   “三支”“两军”锦言集
    毛主席想的是群众，爱的是群众，一心为群众，毛主席和群众心连心。我们热爱毛主席就要热爱群众。
    要和群众心连心，就得向群众交真心。
    我们的一切，群众看得最清楚，请群众讲评，他们最有发言权。群众认为好的，我们就要坚持；群众批评对的，我们就要立即纠正。
    群众是最亮的镜子，到群众中去，才能认清自己。
    在火热的阶级斗争中办毛泽东思想大学校，课堂最大，要敢于去锻炼；教员最多，要有甘当小学生的精神；考题最硬，要用毛泽东思想去回答。
    要实现部队思想革命化，就要把部队放到阶级斗争的“风口上”、“浪头里”去“化”，才能“化”得深，“化”得透，“化”得彻底。
    在新的历史时期中，军队不但要在军事上成为捍卫无产阶级专政的钢铁长城，更要在政治思想上成为防修、反修的钢铁长城。
