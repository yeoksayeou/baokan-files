In the triumphant song of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a mass rally of 10,000 people today to surround and eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, promote revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and advance revolution while promoting production. Workers from various factories, mines, and enterprises who participated in the rally unanimously declared: The proletariat of the capital, living by the side of Chairman Mao, will surely be a model in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We will thoroughly eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, quickly achieve and consolidate revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and launch a new high tide in the establishment of grassroots revolutionary committees, letting the spring breeze blow through every corner of the capital.

Shi Fuqi, the chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Wu De, the vice-chairman, and Fu Chongbi, the vice-chairman and commander of the Beijing Garrison, all spoke at the rally.

The rally was presided over by Huang Zuojin, secretary-general of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and second political commissar of the Beijing Garrison.

The rally pointed out that the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide is unprecedentedly good, and the situation in Beijing is getting better and better. The proletariat of the capital, living by the side of Chairman Mao, listens most to Chairman Mao's words and most resolutely carries out Chairman Mao's instructions. In September last year, the proletariat of the capital took the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, taking the lead and achieving revolutionary unity in a short period of time, promoting revolutionary unity across the city's various fronts. Now, nearly 400 large and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises in the city have achieved the three-in-one combination on the basis of consolidating and developing revolutionary unity, establishing revolutionary committees; 15 out of 18 counties and districts have established revolutionary committees; more than 90% of the people's communes in the suburban rural areas have established revolutionary committees. More than 2 million people in the city have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. A massive movement to surround and eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has been launched in all factories, mines, communes, institutions, and schools in the city, greatly accelerating the pace of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

The rally pointed out that at present, there are still a few units that have not achieved revolutionary unity, and the revolutionary unity of some units is not yet consolidated. The main obstacle is that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is at work. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a big poisonous snake, a dangerous enemy hidden within our revolutionary ranks. People with serious factionalism are deaf and blind, cannot see the situation, cannot see the enemy, and cannot hear the voice of the proletarian headquarters. For the interests of one faction, they disregard the interests of the Party, the state, and the people. Without eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, it is impossible to achieve and consolidate revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Whether to uphold proletarian party principles or to uphold bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a manifestation of the struggle between the two lines in the current new situation. The enemy uses factionalism, and factionalism protects the enemy. The proletarian revolutionary masses must heighten their revolutionary vigilance, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, surround and eliminate factionalism, expose and root out factionalism, and bury it thoroughly. The proletarian revolutionary masses must respond to Chairman Mao's call to "not rely on past merits but to make new contributions" and make new contributions in surrounding and eliminating factionalism and promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

The rally called for the full and unconditional implementation of Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, boldly and resolutely liberating revolutionary cadres. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This issue must be resolved." The proletarian revolutionary masses must handle cadres in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, starting from education and expanding the scope of education. Except for a handful of traitors, spies, and diehard capitalist roaders, revolutionary cadres must be resolutely supported to come out and revolutionize. We must eliminate factionalism in handling cadres, correct deviations in the work of liberating cadres, and use the formula of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to help cadres correct their mistakes. Revolutionary cadres must wage a fierce struggle against their selfishness, discard their fear, dare to revolutionize themselves, actively go to the masses to criticize their mistakes, and earnestly correct them, making new contributions in promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

The rally believed that every proletarian revolutionary must be a model of strictly observing proletarian organizational discipline and promoting revolution and production. That kind of laissez-faire, disregard for organizational discipline, doing whatever one likes, and not doing what one does not like is absolutely not a manifestation of proletarian revolutionary nature, but a serious outbreak of bourgeois anarchism. Anarchism is a bourgeois ideology. The bourgeoisie adopts various means to corrupt the proletariat and revolutionary masses, one of which is anarchism. At present, anarchism is also an obstacle to achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we must resolutely fight against it.

Representatives of revolutionary workers from Beijing Paper Mill, Beijing First Machine Tool Plant, and Beijing Third Textile Mill spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to respond to the rally's call, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, taking Beijing Knitting Mill as an example, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, strengthening proletarian party principles, launching a new high tide of surrounding and eliminating factionalism, and launching a more profound "people's war" to completely and thoroughly eliminate factionalism. They said: We, the proletariat of the capital, must be models in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, models in "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," surrounding and eliminating factionalism, promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and models in promoting revolution and production. We must redouble our efforts, strive to be the best, and continue to make new contributions to achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and welcome a new high tide in socialist construction!

Representatives of the Beijing Workers' Congress also read a call at the meeting to surround and eliminate factionalism and quickly establish revolutionary committees in factories and enterprises.

    坚持党性，打倒派性，在当前新形势下两条路线斗争中立新功
    毛主席身边的工人阶级誓做全面落实最新指示的模范
    北京市革委会在大好形势下召开万人誓师大会，谢富治等同志在大会上讲了话
    新华社九日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，北京市革命委员会今天召开了围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，促进革命大联合、革命三结合，抓革命促生产的万人誓师大会。参加大会的各厂矿企业的无产阶级革命派一致表示：首都工人阶级誓作紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署和全面落实毛主席最新指示的模范，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，迅速实现和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，掀起建立基层革命委员会的新高潮，让春风吹遍首都的每一个角落。
    北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治，副主任委员吴德，副主任委员、北京卫戍区司令员傅崇碧，都在大会上讲了话。
    大会由北京市革命委员会秘书长、北京卫戍区第二政委黄作珍主持。
    大会指出，目前全国无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好，北京市的形势也越来越好。生活在毛主席身边的首都工人阶级，最听毛主席的话，最坚决地照毛主席的指示办事。去年九月，首都工人阶级带头贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，一马当先，在很短时间里普遍实现了革命的大联合，推动了全市各条战线上的革命大联合。现在，全市有近四百个大中型工矿企业在巩固和发展革命大联合的基础上，实现了革命的三结合，建立了革命委员会；全市十八个县、区，有十五个建立了革命委员会；郊区农村人民公社，有百分之九十以上建立了革命委员会。全市参加毛泽东思想学习班的，已经有二百多万人。一个声势浩大的围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的群众运动，在全市各个工矿企业、公社、机关、学校迅速掀起，革命大联合和革命三结合的步伐大大加快了。
    大会指出，当前还有少数单位没有实现革命的大联合，一部分单位的革命大联合还不够巩固，主要的障碍就是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在作怪。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是一条大毒蛇，是隐藏在我们革命队伍内的危险的敌人。派性严重的人，耳聋、眼瞎，看不清形势，看不见敌人，听不进无产阶级司令部的声音，为了一派利益，不顾党、国家和人民的利益。不打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就不能实现和巩固革命大联合和革命三结合，就不能全面落实毛主席的最新指示，就不能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。是坚持无产阶级党性，还是坚持资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是在当前新形势下两条路线斗争的表现形式。敌人利用派性，派性掩护敌人。无产阶级革命派一定要提高革命警惕，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，围剿派性，搞臭派性，打倒派性，狠揭派性的盖子，狠挖派性的根子，把派性彻底埋葬。无产阶级革命派一定要响应毛主席的“不要吃老本，要立新功”的伟大号召，在围剿派性，促进革命大联合和革命三结合中立新功。
    大会号召，要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，大胆地坚决地解放革命干部。毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”无产阶级革命派对待干部，一定要遵照毛主席的指示，从教育着手，扩大教育面。除一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派以外，要坚决支持革命干部站出来革命。要打倒对待干部问题上的派性，克服解放干部工作中的偏差，用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，帮助干部改正错误。革命干部要狠斗自己的私字，丢掉怕字，敢于革自己的命，主动到群众中检讨错误，认真改正，在促进革命大联合和革命三结合中立新功。
    大会认为，每一个无产阶级革命派都应该成为严格遵守无产阶级组织纪律，抓革命、促生产的模范。那种放任自流，目无组织纪律，自己高兴干什么就干什么，自己不高兴干什么就不干什么的做法，绝不是无产阶级革命性的表现，而是资产阶级无政府主义的恶性大发作。无政府主义是一种资产阶级思想。资产阶级采取种种方式腐蚀无产阶级和革命群众，其中之一就是无政府主义。在当前，无政府主义也是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的障碍，我们必须坚决向它进行斗争。
   北京造纸总厂、北京第一机床厂和北京第三棉纺织厂的革命职工代表，在会上发言一致表示，坚决响应大会的号召，以毛泽东思想为武器，以北京针织总厂为榜样，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，增强无产阶级党性，掀起一个围剿派性的新高潮，展开一场更加深入人心的围剿派性的“人民战争”，把派性全部、彻底消灭掉。他们说：我们首都工人阶级一定要做活学活用毛主席最新指示的模范，做“斗私，批修”，围剿派性，促进革命大联合和革命三结合的模范，做抓革命、促生产的模范。要鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，迎接社会主义建设的新高潮！
    北京市工代会代表还在会上宣读了关于围剿派性，在厂矿企业中迅速建立革命委员会的号召书。
