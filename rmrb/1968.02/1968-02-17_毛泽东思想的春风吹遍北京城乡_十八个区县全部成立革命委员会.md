The spring breeze sweeps across Beijing, and the dawn light illuminates the city and countryside. Under the guidance of the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, by February 14, all 18 districts and counties in Beijing's urban and suburban areas have established revolutionary committees.

The establishment of revolutionary committees at the district and county levels in Beijing is a great victory following the glorious birth of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee in April last year. This victory was achieved by the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in the capital, who closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and resolutely implemented his series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The establishment of revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs at the district and county levels has further strengthened the leadership organs of the revolutionary people of the entire city—Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Beijing are advancing along the revolutionary course opened up by the great leader Chairman Mao, striving for comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

During his inspection of the three major regions last year, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. 'In a few more months, the overall situation will become even better.' The revolutionary committees at the district and county levels in Beijing were born one after another in this increasingly excellent revolutionary situation. Since last October, various industries in the city have, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers executing the 'three supports, two militaries' tasks, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taken 'fight selfishness and criticize revisionism' as the key, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and greatly accelerated the ideological revolutionization of the people. Mao Zedong Thought combined with the revolutionary people has made the face of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital change with each passing day. Currently, more than 2.5 million people in the city have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Many factories, schools, departments, and enterprises have, under revolutionary principles, achieved revolutionary great unions according to systems, industries, and classes. So far, more than 55% of the central and municipal industrial enterprises, more than 90% of the rural people's communes, and more than 94% of the urban and suburban primary and secondary schools have established revolutionary committees.

The revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs at the district and county levels in Beijing were established in the midst of fierce struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. The process of struggle is the process of victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee in April last year, the broad proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary people in various districts and counties, under the leadership of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, further fought against the sabotage activities of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the ghosts and monsters in society, foiling the various evil plots of the class enemies to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and eliminating interference from the right and ultra-left. Several million revolutionary people in the city closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, completely isolating a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Especially after Chairman Mao's latest instructions were conveyed, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various districts and counties rapidly developed. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in the city actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to 'fight selfishness and criticize revisionism,' from urban areas to suburban areas, from factories, offices, schools to commune members' households, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were set up everywhere, and a wave of studying, lecturing, and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions swept across the city. The broad masses of revolutionaries fiercely fought against selfishness, annihilated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and seriously, actively, and enthusiastically helped the broad revolutionary cadres to bravely stand up and revolutionize, achieving revolutionary great unions and revolutionary three-in-one from the bottom up. Some districts and counties also successively exposed the class enemies hidden within the revolutionary ranks, completely foiling the class enemies' plots to incite and utilize factionalism to cover up themselves.

Through such fierce struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. The workers', peasants', and students' movements under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought have merged into an irresistible torrent. The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee fully utilized its proletarian revolutionary authority to effectively promote the seizure of power struggles in various districts and counties. Thus, the conditions for the establishment of temporary power organs in various districts and counties gradually matured. From September last year to mid-February this year, the revolutionary committees in 18 districts and counties were established one after another.

In the fierce struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, the People's Liberation Army executing the 'three supports, two militaries' tasks played a great role. The broad soldiers and officers firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, adhered to the principle of 'supporting the left but not supporting factions,' and with the greatest enthusiasm, propagated Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and Red Guards, and helped them implement them in action. Where the struggle was most intense, where the masses needed the most, there the People's Liberation Army appeared. They braved the scorching heat and bitter cold, climbed mountains and crossed rivers, traversing every corner of the city and countryside, quickly and timely conveying Chairman Mao's voice and the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to workshops, classrooms, streets, towns, and even the most remote villages, powerfully promoting revolutionary great unions and revolutionary three-in-one, and making great contributions to the establishment of district and county-level revolutionary committees and the achievement of new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary committees in various districts and counties were established after first forming workers', peasants', and Red Guards' congresses and achieving revolutionary great unions by systems. Their members include revolutionary pioneers who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, representatives of the People's Liberation Army who made outstanding contributions in the 'three supports, two militaries' work, and revolutionary cadres who have been tested by storms and waves and are supported by the masses. Most of them come from the front lines of production and grassroots work units, do not leave production labor, and have close ties with the masses. Their average age is around thirty, full of revolutionary vigor. After the establishment of the district and county revolutionary committees, they took it as their duty to uphold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The committee members all strive to be propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, fighters against selfishness and revisionism, good students learning from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, servants of the people, and good workers and commune members actively participating in production labor. Therefore, they have received the enthusiastic support and praise of the broad masses of revolutionaries.

After the birth of the revolutionary committees in various districts and counties, they strengthened the leadership of the revolution and production in their respective regions, making the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought reach a new high, and the situation of seizing the revolution and promoting production emerge anew. As soon as the district and county revolutionary committees were established, they studied, propagated, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the highest enthusiasm, greatest determination, and fastest speed. Some districts and counties held multiple meetings to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, introducing the typical experiences of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. For the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in their respective regions, most districts and counties have made comprehensive plans. Many leading cadres personally went deep into the grassroots, grasped the key points, and conducted typical experiments. Some districts and counties also systematically analyzed the history of the struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in their regions over the past decade, compiled the materials and sent them to the grassroots, powerfully promoting the in-depth development of revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation in the grassroots units, and promoting the consolidation and development of revolutionary great unions and revolutionary three-in-one. Currently, the revolution and production in various districts and counties present a thriving scene, and proletarian dictatorship has never been as solid as it is today. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing is advancing to comprehensive victory at a higher level!

    毛泽东思想的春风吹遍北京城乡  十八个区县全部成立革命委员会
    区、县级革命委员会在人民解放军的热情帮助下，大抓领导成员的思想革命化，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现新高潮，抓革命促生产出现新局面
    新华社十六日讯　春风遍北京，城乡尽朝晖。在伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示指引下，北京市城区和郊区的十八个区、县，到本月十四日，已经全部成立了革命委员会。
    北京市区、县一级革命委员会的全部成立，是继去年四月北京市革命委员会光荣诞生以后，首都无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命一系列极为重要的最新指示，所取得的新的伟大胜利。区、县一级革命三结合临时权力机构的相继建立，使全市革命人民的领导机关——北京市革命委员会更加巩固。在各级革命委员会的领导下，北京市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，正沿着伟大领袖毛主席开辟的革命航道，以新的步伐，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席去年视察三大区时指出：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。”“再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好。”北京市区、县一级革命委员会，就是在越来越好的大好革命形势下陆续诞生的。从去年十月以来，全市各行各业，在执行“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军指战员的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，大大加速了人的思想革命化。毛泽东思想同革命人民相结合，使首都无产阶级文化大革命的面貌日新月异。目前，全市已有二百五十多万人参加了毛泽东思想学习班，许多工厂、学校、部门、企业单位，都在革命的原则下，按照系统，按照行业，按照班级，实现了革命的大联合，发展了革命的三结合。到现在为止，全市百分之五十五以上的中央和市属工业企业，百分之九十以上的农村人民公社，百分之九十四以上的城区和近郊区中小学，都成立了革命委员会。
    北京市区、县一级革命三结合临时权力机构，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中建立起来的。斗争的过程，就是毛主席革命路线胜利的过程，去年四月北京市革命委员会成立后，各区、县广大的无产阶级革命派和革命人民，就在市革委会的领导下，进一步同党内一小撮走资派和社会上牛鬼蛇神的破坏活动展开了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的种种罪恶阴谋，排除了来自右的方面和极“左”方面的干扰。全市几百万革命人民紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，深入开展了革命的大批判，使党内一小撮走资派完全孤立。特别是毛主席的最新指示传达以后，各区、县的无产阶级文化大革命运动迅速发展。全市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众积极响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，从城区到郊区，从工厂、机关、学校到社员家庭，到处办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了大学、大讲、大用毛主席最新指示的热潮。广大革命群众狠斗私心，围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，严肃、积极、热情地帮助广大革命干部勇敢地站出来革命，自下而上地纷纷实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。一些区、县还先后揪出了混在革命队伍内部的阶级敌人，使阶级敌人煽动派性、利用派性掩护自己的阴谋彻底破产。
    经过这样激烈的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，毛主席的革命路线空前深入人心，毛泽东思想指引下的革命的工人运动、农民运动、学生运动汇成了一股不可阻挡的洪流。北京市革命委员会充分运用自己的无产阶级革命权威，有效地推动了各个区、县的夺权斗争。这样就使各个区、县成立临时权力机构的条件逐渐成熟，从去年九月开始到今年二月中旬，十八个区、县的革命委员会就相继全部建立起来了。
    在无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派夺权的激烈斗争中，执行“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军发挥了伟大长城的威力。广大指战员坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚持“支左不支派”的原则，以最大的热情，向广大工农群众和红卫兵小将宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的最新指示，并帮助他们落实到行动上。哪里斗争最激烈，哪里群众最需要，哪里就有人民解放军出现。他们不避酷暑和严寒，爬山涉水，走遍城乡各个角落，把毛主席的声音，把以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的声音，迅速及时地传达到车间、课堂、街道、村镇，直至最偏僻的山村，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，为建立区、县级革命委员会，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，立下了不朽的功勋。
    各区、县革命委员会，是在首先组成工代会、农代会、红代会，按系统实现了革命大联合的条件下成立起来的。它的成员，有在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命闯将，有在“三支”“两军”工作中立下了功勋的人民解放军代表，有经过大风大浪的考验、得到群众拥护的革命领导干部。其中多数来自生产第一线和基层工作单位，不脱离生产劳动，和群众有密切联系。他们的平均年龄在三十岁左右，富有革命朝气。区、县革命委员会成立以后，把高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，当作自己的天职，首先狠抓革命委员会成员的思想革命化。委员们个个争当毛泽东思想的宣传员，斗私批修的战斗员，向工人、贫下中农学习的好学员，为人民服务的勤务员，积极参加生产劳动的好工人、好社员，因此得到了广大革命群众的热烈拥护和赞扬。
    各区、县革命委员会诞生后，加强了对本地区革命和生产的领导，使活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高涨，抓革命促生产出现了新局面。区、县革命委员会一成立，都以最高的热情，最大的决心，最快的速度，学习、宣传和贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，一些区、县多次召开活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用会，介绍了工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将、革命干部等斗私批修的典型经验。对于本地区的无产阶级文化大革命运动，绝大多数区、县先后作出全面规划。许多领导干部亲自深入基层，抓住重点，进行典型试验。有的区、县还系统地分析了本地区十几年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争史，整理成材料发到基层，有力地推动了基层单位革命大批判和斗批改的深入开展，促进了革命大联合和革命三结合的巩固和发展。目前，各区、县的革命和生产呈现出一派蓬蓬勃勃的景象，无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固。北京市无产阶级文化大革命，正在一个更高的水平上，大踏步地走向全面胜利！
