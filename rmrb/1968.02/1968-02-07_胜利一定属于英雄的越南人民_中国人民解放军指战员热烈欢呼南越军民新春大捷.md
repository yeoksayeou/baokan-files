The heroic South Vietnamese people's armed forces, with a mighty force like a mountain collapsing and the power of thunder, launched a swift and powerful offensive during the Spring Festival, sweeping across the entire South Vietnam, fiercely attacking the lair of the U.S. and puppet forces in Saigon, striking down the U.S. aggressors and making them howl in defeat. The news of victory has brought great joy and encouragement to all of us. We enthusiastically cheer for the South Vietnamese military and people's great victory! We wholeheartedly congratulate the South Vietnamese people for setting another great example of daring to struggle and daring to win for the revolutionary people of the world, and for making another great contribution to the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the people of the world!

The Spring Festival victory of the South Vietnamese people is a declaration of great spirit. It once again solemnly declares to the world: the heroic Vietnamese people are determined to carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end. No matter what tricks and conspiracies the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique plot, as long as the U.S. aggressors do not leave Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people's struggle will never stop. The more U.S. aggressors increase their troops, the more the South Vietnamese people will launch more fierce attacks to annihilate these wolves, until there is not a single U.S. aggressor on Vietnamese soil!

The Spring Festival victory of the South Vietnamese people once again proves the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

The 700 million Chinese people are determined to be the strong backing of the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness for war," further implement the five shining golden words of "loyalty to Chairman Mao" in all aspects of fighting, work, study, and life, and better prepare for all battles. We will support the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war and defend our own motherland, acting as good air sentinels and standing guard!

Victory will definitely belong to the heroic and great Vietnamese people!

Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards

The heroic South Vietnamese people launched a new, unprecedented, and fierce attack on the U.S. and puppet forces during the Spring Festival, achieving a brilliant victory.

Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and no heroes fear bears and tigers. The Spring Festival victory of the South Vietnamese people fully demonstrates the boundless power of people's war, once again eloquently proving the revolutionary truth that all reactionaries are paper tigers, applicable everywhere. The millions of people who genuinely support the revolution are the true iron wall. The seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism is merely an externally strong but internally weak paper tiger, with nothing to be afraid of. Remember when the U.S. imperialists first invaded Vietnam, how arrogant they were; look at them now, under the heavy blows of the Vietnamese people, they have become frightened birds and trapped rats.

The heroic South Vietnamese people, China and Vietnam are neighboring countries with a close relationship. The Chinese and Vietnamese people are brothers who share weal and woe. Your struggle is our struggle. Your victory is our victory. We fully support your anti-American, national salvation struggle! We have made all preparations for battle. As long as you need us, with a command from the motherland, we will immediately rush to the Vietnamese battlefield, fight shoulder to shoulder with you, and bury our common enemy—the evil U.S. imperialist aggressors—in the vast ocean of people's war!

Persistence leads to victory

Recently, the heroic South Vietnamese military and people launched a large-scale, fierce attack on the U.S. aggressors and their puppets, Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, achieving a new great victory.

This brilliant victory marks the development of the South Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war to a new height. The U.S. aggressors and their puppets have completely fallen into the vast ocean of the people's war of the heroic South Vietnamese people. The initiative of the war is entirely in the hands of the heroic South Vietnamese military and people. The 500,000 U.S. aggressors are in a passive situation of being beaten. The so-called powerful U.S. imperialism has exposed its true form as a paper tiger. The U.S. leader Johnson, who is used to putting on a bold front, is now as anxious as an ant on a hot pan, confused, and at a loss.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Persistence leads to victory." Currently, the U.S. aggressors are suffering defeats on the Vietnamese battlefield, and the final victory of the South Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war is approaching. However, before achieving the final victory, there is still a difficult journey ahead because the enemy will definitely make a desperate struggle. The heroic South Vietnamese people, tempered by long-term struggles, with great courage, fight braver and stronger. We are firmly convinced that the final victory will belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!

Vietnamese people will win! U.S. imperialism will be defeated!

Smash the U.S. paper tiger

The heroic South Vietnamese military and people have all joined the battle, setting up a people's war net, defeating the well-armed U.S. imperialists, making them lose their helmets and armor, and cry in pain.

The U.S. is trying to save its failing situation in Vietnam by expanding the war of aggression and making a desperate struggle. However, the Vietnamese people are heroic people standing tall. They carry forward the spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, determined to carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end, and drive out the U.S. aggressors from their soil, not leaving a single one behind.

To sweep away all harmful insects, there are no enemies. We are Chairman Mao's soldiers. We cheer for the Spring Festival victory of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces. We firmly support the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war. As long as the Vietnamese people need us, with a command from the motherland, we will immediately rush to the Vietnamese battlefield, fight side by side with the Vietnamese brothers, raise the thousand-catty hammer, and smash the U.S. paper tiger.

    胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民
    中国人民解放军指战员热烈欢呼南越军民新春大捷
    辉煌的胜利　巨大的鼓舞
    英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量在春节期间，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，发动迅雷不及掩耳的强大攻势，席卷整个越南南方，猛袭西贡美伪的巢穴，打得美国侵略军人仰马翻，鬼哭狼嚎。捷报传来，我们全体同志无不欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢呼南越军民打得好！打得漂亮！打得痛快！热烈祝贺南越人民又一次为全世界革命人民树立了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的榜样，为全世界人民的反帝革命斗争立下了新的伟大功勋！
    越南南方军民的新春大捷，是气壮山河的宣言书。它再一次向世界庄严宣告：英雄的越南人民誓把抗美救国战争进行到底。不管美帝国主义勾结苏修叛徒集团搞什么阴谋诡计，只要美国侵略强盗一天不离开越南国土，越南人民的战斗就一天不停息。美国强盗增兵越多，南越人民就越要以更加凌厉的攻势来歼灭这些豺狼，一直打到越南国土上没有一个美国侵略者为止！
    越南南方人民的新春大捷，又一次证明了全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    七亿中国人民誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。我们一定遵照毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的指示，进一步把“忠于毛主席”这五个金光闪闪的大字，贯穿到战斗、工作、学习和生活的一切方面去，更完善地作好一切战斗准备，为支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，为保卫自己的祖国，当好空中哨兵，站好岗！
    胜利一定属于英雄的、伟大的越南人民！

    独有英雄驱虎豹
    英雄的越南南方人民在新春之际，向美伪集团发动了新的规模空前的猛烈进攻，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。越南南方人民的新春大捷，充分显示了人民战争的无穷威力，再一次雄辩地证明了一切反动派都是纸老虎这一放之四海而皆准的革命真理。千百万真心实意拥护革命的群众是真正的铜墙铁壁，貌似强大的美帝国主义只不过是只外强中干的纸老虎，并没有什么了不起。想当年，美帝国主义刚刚侵入越南时，是何等的嚣张；看今朝，它们在越南人民的沉重打击下，已成了惊弓之鸟，瓮中之鳖。
    英雄的越南南方人民，中越两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。中越两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。你们的胜利就是我们的胜利。对于你们的抗美救国斗争，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持！我们已经作好一切战斗准备，只要你们需要，祖国一声令下，我们就立即奔赴越南战场，和你们并肩作战，把我们共同的敌人——万恶的美帝国主义强盗，坚决彻底干净全部地埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海里！

    坚持下去就是胜利
    最近，英雄的越南南方军民，向美国侵略者及其走狗阮文绍—阮高其集团发动了大规模的猛烈的袭击，取得了新的伟大胜利。
    这一辉煌胜利，标志着越南南方军民的抗美救国战争发展到了一个新的高度。美国侵略者及其走狗已经完全陷于英雄的越南南方军民的人民战争的汪洋大海之中。战争的主动权完全掌握在英雄的越南南方军民手里，五十万美国侵略军处在被动挨打的境地。号称强大的美帝国主义，纸老虎的原形暴露无遗。惯于打肿脸充胖子的美帝头目约翰逊急得象热锅上的蚂蚁，六神无主，束手无策。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“坚持下去就是胜利。”当前，美国侵略者在越南战场上节节失败，越南南方人民抗美救国战争的最后胜利越来越接近。但在取得最后胜利之前，还有一段艰苦的路程，因为敌人总是要进行垂死挣扎的。久经锻炼的英雄的越南南方人民，以大无畏的英雄气魄，越战越勇，越战越强，我们坚信，最后胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！
    越南人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！
                      四八七七部队战士　潘召新
       砸烂美帝纸老虎
    英雄的越南南方军民齐参战，摆下了人民战争的天罗地网，把武装到牙齿的美帝国主义打得丢盔弃甲，叫苦连天。
    美帝为了挽救在越南的败局，正在图谋扩大侵越战争，作垂死挣扎。但是越南人民是顶天立地的英雄人民。他们发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏精神，誓把抗美救国战争进行到底，把美国强盗一个不剩地赶出自己的国土。
    要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。我们是毛主席的战士，我们为越南南方人民解放武装力量取得的新春大捷欢呼。我们坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。只要越南人民需要，祖国一声令下，我们就立即奔赴越南战场，同越南兄弟并肩战斗，奋起千钧棒，砸烂美帝纸老虎。
