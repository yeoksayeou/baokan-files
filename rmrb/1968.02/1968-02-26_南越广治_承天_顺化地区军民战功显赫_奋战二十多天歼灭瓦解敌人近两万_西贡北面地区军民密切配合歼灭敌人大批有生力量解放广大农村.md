The military and civilians in South Vietnam's Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region have achieved great victories. After fighting for more than twenty days, they have annihilated and disintegrated nearly 20,000 enemy forces. In the areas north of Saigon, the military and civilians have closely cooperated to annihilate a large number of enemy forces and liberate vast rural areas.

HANOI, February 25 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Liberation Communications Agency of South Vietnam, the military and civilians in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region of South Vietnam have achieved remarkable victories since launching the Tet Offensive on January 31.

According to incomplete statistics, from January 31 to February 21, the military and civilians in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region annihilated and disintegrated 19,650 enemy forces, including 4,133 U.S. invaders. They captured 1,723 U.S. and puppet soldiers (including one U.S. colonel, two puppet colonels, and two majors).

Among the annihilated enemy forces, the entire puppet armored regiment, seven battalions, and eighteen companies were completely wiped out. A U.S. armored regiment, three marine battalions, and a puppet regiment and six battalions were severely damaged. The entire "civilian labor" system of the enemy was also disintegrated. During this period, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched fierce attacks on almost all U.S. and puppet military bases in the region, causing heavy losses to important enemy bases such as Phu Bai, Ai Tu, Dong Ha, La Vang, and Chi Thanh, and forcing the enemy to withdraw from ten outposts and sentry posts.

The military and civilians in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region also shot down and destroyed 159 enemy aircraft, destroyed 283 enemy vehicles, destroyed 29 enemy artillery pieces, sank and damaged 33 enemy ships, seized 100 enemy transport vehicles and a large amount of weapons, occupied 11 enemy warehouses, blew up 16 bridges, and cut off the No. 1 highway from Hue to Da Nang, paralyzing enemy transportation.

The heroic military and civilians of the ancient city of Hue closely cooperated with the farmers in the suburbs, fought bravely, and made great contributions to the above-mentioned brilliant achievements. In these more than twenty days, the military and civilians of Hue alone annihilated and disintegrated 12,150 enemy forces (including 2,223 U.S. invaders), shot down and destroyed 125 enemy aircraft, destroyed 195 enemy vehicles, sank and damaged 33 enemy ships, and seized more than 2,000 enemy weapons.

HANOI, February 25 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Liberation Communications Agency of South Vietnam, since the beginning of the Tet Offensive, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam have launched continuous attacks on the enemy in the areas north of Saigon (including parts of Gia Dinh, Thu Duc, and Binh Duong provinces near Saigon), annihilating a large number of enemy forces, tying down a large number of enemy troops, liberating vast rural areas, and extending the liberated areas to the suburbs of Saigon.

According to incomplete statistics, from the night of January 30 to February 8, the military and civilians in the areas north of Saigon annihilated and disintegrated 8,042 enemy forces, including 2,804 U.S. invaders; destroyed 164 vehicles; shot down and destroyed 117 aircraft; burned down two large fuel depots and two ammunition depots (storing 10,000 rockets and other ammunition weighing 40 tons); and seized a large amount of weapons and ammunition.

During these ten days, the military and civilians in the areas north of Saigon simultaneously attacked the towns of Go Vap, Thu Duc, Phu Lam, Bien Hoa, Dinh Tuong, Ben Cat, and Phu Cuong, as well as the important military bases of the U.S. and puppet forces in Dong Nai, Lai Thieu, and Dinh Tuong. All enemy outposts and sentry posts along the No. 1 and No. 13 highways were also fiercely attacked by the People's Liberation Armed Forces. In the battle, the People's Liberation Armed Forces captured and forced the enemy to withdraw from 28 outposts and sentry posts, smashed many of the enemy's grassroots ruling organizations, liberated many communes, and destroyed dozens of "strategic hamlets."

While the People's Liberation Armed Forces were attacking the enemy, the people in this region rose up to fight, capture and punish the thugs of the puppet regime, and quickly established armed self-defense forces. Revolutionary governments were also established in many places.

The liberated people, with great excitement, actively participated in various anti-American, national salvation activities. Nearly 1,000 young people enthusiastically enlisted in the army, and thousands of people joined the civilian labor force to support the front lines.
