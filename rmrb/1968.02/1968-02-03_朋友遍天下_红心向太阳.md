Sailors on Chinese ocean-going ships have, through their personal experiences, deeply felt the boundless love that the revolutionary people of the world have for the great leader Chairman Mao, and their boundless admiration for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary people around the world praise Chairman Mao as the great helmsman of the world's revolutionary people, the savior of humanity; they call Chairman Mao's works a shining revolutionary treasure; they yearn for New China, yearn for the center of the world revolution—Beijing. Below are some excerpts from what Chinese sailors have seen and heard in various places.

	“Long live Mao Zedong!”
	Once, Chinese sailors in the French city of Saint-Nazaire encountered workers from a local shipyard who were engaged in a tenacious strike against the shipyard's capitalists. The arrival of the Chinese sailors greatly encouraged the shipyard workers. Many workers, despite the harassment and threats from the shipyard capitalists and foremen, actively approached the Chinese sailors. They faced the Chinese sailors and shouted in unison, “Long live Mao Zedong!” As they shouted this slogan, their bodies were filled with strength and confidence.

	During the stay of the Chinese sailors, many workers and citizens of the city eagerly sought out the sailors to obtain copies of the “Quotations from Chairman Mao” and Mao badges, expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao and their deep affection for the Chinese people in various ways.

	“Mao Zedong spoke the words in our hearts!”
	A young British worker, upon hearing the news of the arrival of a Chinese ocean-going ship in Sunderland, immediately traveled from a distant place to request a copy of the “Quotations from Chairman Mao” from the Chinese sailors. When his request was fulfilled, he held the book with both hands, excitedly saying, “This is a shining revolutionary treasure!” Once, Chinese sailors in Sunderland encountered an elderly British woman who greeted them warmly. She said to the Chinese sailors, “China is good! I love Chairman Mao.” When parting, she earnestly requested, “Please give me a Mao badge!” Her sincere feelings deeply moved the Chinese sailors, who immediately presented her with a shining Mao badge. The old lady, upon receiving the badge, repeatedly said, “I will wear it on my chest forever, I will wear it on my chest forever!”

	When the Chinese ocean-going ship docked in Liverpool, Britain, many British friends often came aboard the Chinese ship, actively requesting copies of the “Quotations from Chairman Mao” from the Chinese sailors. Some, upon receiving a copy, read it eagerly, while others requested that the Chinese sailors study the quotations with them. They listened quietly as the Chinese comrades read the quotations to them, and the more they listened, the more they wanted to hear. When they were deeply engrossed, they began to read aloud themselves. When the Chinese sailors read the following passage from Chairman Mao: “The oppressed peoples and nations can never entrust their liberation to the ‘wisdom’ of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle,” many British workers present spontaneously exclaimed in unison, “Good! Good! Good! This is a great truth! Mao Zedong spoke the words in our hearts!”

	“Chairman Mao is with us!”
	Bremen, West Germany, is an area occupied by American troops. Armed American soldiers patrolled the docks, strutting about arrogantly. German workers were very angry at the sight of them, hating the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionist traitors. Many workers, in the presence of American soldiers, gave the Chinese sailors a thumbs-up, praising Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Many workers wore shining Mao badges on their chests, walking proudly in front of the American soldiers, demonstrating the German workers' boundless love for Chairman Mao and their fearless revolutionary spirit.

	Once, a shop assistant in West Germany, upon seeing a Chinese sailor wearing a Mao badge, enthusiastically and sincerely said to the Chinese sailor, “Please give me a Mao badge. I will wear it on my chest every day so that hundreds and thousands of Germans can see Mao Zedong.” The Chinese sailors fulfilled his request, and he, as if receiving a treasure, immediately wore the Mao badge neatly on his chest, gazing at it with boundless reverence.

	One day, Chinese sailors hung a portrait of Chairman Mao on the side of the ship, facing the docks of the port of Bremen. Many German workers and students spontaneously ran to the portrait to take commemorative photos. They felt immense happiness from this and proudly said, “Chairman Mao is with us!”

	When the Chinese ocean-going giant ship departed from the port of Bremen, many sailors from foreign ships docked there stared intently at the slowly departing Chinese cargo ship. They also raised their arms, giving a thumbs-up, and shouted loudly, “Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!” to express their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

	“Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!”
	In Poland, wherever the Chinese sailors went, the Polish dock workers always looked at the Mao badges worn by the Chinese sailors with affectionate and envious eyes, or gave a thumbs-up to express their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. Some workers gestured, hoping that the Chinese sailors would give them the Mao badges they wore. When their wishes were fulfilled, they stood proudly in front of the Chinese sailors, showing solemn, joyful, and proud expressions. Some workers, upon receiving the Mao badges, shed tears of excitement, repeatedly shouting, “Great, Mao Zedong! Great, Mao Zedong!”

	Many Polish workers and students, after obtaining a Mao badge for themselves, gestured with their hands, saying that their mothers, wives, brothers, and sisters at home also loved Chairman Mao. They hoped that the Chinese sailors could give them a few more Mao badges.

	One worker said to the Chinese sailors, “Please convey our greetings to Comrade Mao Zedong. Wish Comrade Mao Zedong eternal life!” Another worker said, “My heart yearns for New China. I want to study Chairman Mao's works better.”

    朋友遍天下  红心向太阳
    在大海中航行的中国远洋航船上的海员通过他们的亲身经历，深刻地体会到世界各国革命人民无限热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，无限崇拜战无不胜的毛泽东思想。世界革命人民称颂毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大舵手，人类的救星；他们把毛主席著作称为闪闪发光的革命宝书；他们向往新中国，向往世界革命的中心——北京。下面是中国海员在各地所见所闻中的一些片断。
        “万岁，毛泽东！”
    有一次，中国的海员在法国圣纳泽尔市碰到当地一家船厂的工人在同该厂资本家展开顽强的罢工斗争。中国海员的到达，给船厂的工人以极大的鼓舞。许多工人不顾船厂资本家、工头的刁难和威胁，积极主动地接近中国海员，他们面对着中国海员，齐声高呼：“万岁，毛泽东！”他们高呼这一口号时，浑身充满着力量和信心。
    在中国海员停留期间，这个城市的许多工人和市民纷纷向中国海员索取《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章，并以种种形式表达他们对毛主席的无限热爱和对中国人民的深情厚谊。
    “毛泽东说出了我们工人的心里话！”
    一个英国青年工人听到中国的远洋航船到达桑德兰港的消息后，就立刻从很远的地方赶来，向中国海员索取《毛主席语录》。当他的要求得到满足时，他双手捧着《毛主席语录》，激动地说：“这是一本闪闪发光的革命宝书！”
    有一次，中国海员在桑德兰的一条路上，迎面走来一位白发苍苍的英国老太太，她主动跟中国朋友打招呼，对中国海员说：“中国好！我热爱毛主席。”在分别时，她还恳切地要求说：“请给我一枚毛主席像章！”她的真挚感情使中国海员深受感动，他们立即把一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章赠送给她。这位老太太获得像章后高兴地连连说：“我要永远挂在胸前，我要永远挂在胸前！”
    当中国的远洋航船停靠在英国的利物浦港时，常常有许多英国朋友来到中国船上，主动向中国海员索取《毛主席语录》。有的一拿到手就如饥似渴地读起来，有些人还要求中国海员和他们一起学习毛主席语录。他们静静地听中国同志给他们朗读毛主席语录，越听越爱听。当听得入神时，他们便自己放声朗读起来。中国海员读到毛主席的下面一段语录：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”这时候，在场的许多英国工人不约而同地连声称赞说：“好！好！好！这是伟大的真理！毛泽东说出了我们工人的心里话！”
  “毛主席
  和我们在一起！”
    西德不来梅港是美军占领区。荷枪实弹的美国兵在码头上来往巡回，神气活现。西德的工人们看了很气愤，他们恨透了美国佬和苏修叛徒集团，许多工人当着美国兵的面，对中国海员翘起大拇指，赞扬毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。许多工人把金光闪闪的毛主席像章挂在胸前，在美国兵面前昂然地走来走去，显示出西德工人对毛主席的无限热爱和不畏强暴的革命精神。
    一次，西德一家商店的售货员看见中国海员胸前佩戴着毛主席像章，就热情而诚恳地对中国海员说：“你们把毛主席像章送给我一枚吧。我把毛主席像章挂在胸前，每天好让成百成千的德国人看见毛泽东。”中国海员满足了他的要求，他如获至宝，立即把毛主席像章端端正正地佩戴在胸前，以无限崇敬的目光凝视着毛主席像章。
    一天，中国海员把毛主席像挂在航船的舷外，向着不来梅港口的码头。许多德国工人和学生不约而同地跑到毛主席像前拍照留念。他们为此感到无限幸福，并自豪地说：“毛主席和我们在一起！”
    当中国远洋巨轮离开不来梅港的时候，许多停靠在那里的外国船上的海员们，都目不转睛地注视着徐徐启航的中国货轮。他们还伸直胳膊，翘起大拇指，高声喊着：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”以表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱的心情。
        “祝毛泽东同志万寿无疆！”
    在波兰，中国海员所到之处，波兰码头工人总是用亲切而羡慕的眼光注视着中国海员胸前佩戴的毛主席像章，或者竖起大拇指表示对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱。有的工人用手比划着希望中国海员把自己胸前佩戴的毛主席像章送给他。当他们如愿以偿时，他们就挺起胸膛站在中国海员面前，表现出庄严、喜悦和自豪的神情。有的工人接过毛主席像章时，含着激动的泪水，连连喊着：“伟大，毛泽东！伟大，毛泽东！”
    许多波兰工人和学生，自己要了一枚毛主席像章以后，还用手比划着说，自己家里还有母亲、妻子、兄弟姐妹也同样热爱毛主席。他们希望中国海员们能再送给他们几枚毛主席像章。
    有位工人对中国海员说：“请你代我们向毛泽东同志问好。祝毛泽东同志万寿无疆！”还有一位工人说：
  “我的心向往着新中国，我要更好学习毛主席著作。”
