The Sri Lankan Communist Party's English weekly "Red Flag" published an editorial on the 13th, warmly praising the heroic South Vietnamese military and people for their great victories in the anti-American national salvation war since the New Year.

The editorial said that the Vietnamese people's New Year victories fully prove that in war, weapons are important, but they are not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people.

The editorial pointed out that the victory of the Vietnamese people shows that a country waging a war of national liberation, as long as it unites its own people and uses the strategy and tactics of people's war, can defeat an apparently powerful enemy.

The editorial said that there is no doubt that American imperialism is about to collapse in Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia. Like a cornered beast, it will become more and more ferocious and brutal as it approaches death, but it is doomed to perish.

The New China News Agency, London, February 25th: The latest issue of "Challenge," the organ of the American Progressive Labor Party, published an editorial celebrating the New Year victories of the South Vietnamese military and people.

The editorial pointed out that the recent developments in South Vietnam clearly show that the Vietnamese people "not only hold the initiative in politics but also hold the initiative in military affairs." "People's war has inflicted one defeat after another on the United States. The U.S. aggressor forces are being besieged on all fronts (in the South Vietnamese battlefield)."

The newspaper said that Johnson and his ilk are escalating the war, attempting to reverse an irreversible situation. However, "all (war) escalations will have only one result: the United States will suffer even greater defeats."

The editorial emphasized that the great victories recently achieved by the Vietnamese people once again confirm the belief that American imperialism can be defeated.

    锡共《红旗》和美国《挑战》发表社论欢呼南越军民的辉煌胜利
    团结人民开展人民战争就能打败美帝
    新华社科伦坡电　锡兰共产党英文周刊《红旗》十三日发表社论，热烈赞扬英雄的越南南方军民新春以来在抗美救国战争中取得的伟大胜利。
    社论说，越南人民的新春大捷充分证明，在战争中，武器虽然重要，但它不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人。
    社论指出，越南人民的胜利表明，进行民族解放战争的国家只要团结本国人民，运用人民战争的战略战术，就能战胜貌似强大的敌人。
    社论说，毫无疑问，美帝国主义在越南、在整个东南亚快完蛋了。它象一匹走投无路的野兽一样，在临死亡的时候，总是要变得更加疯狂残暴，但是它注定要灭亡。
    新华社伦敦二十五日电　美国进步劳工党机关报《挑战》报最近一期发表社论，欢呼越南南方军民的新春大捷。
    社论指出，南越最近的形势发展清楚地表明：越南人民“不仅掌握着政治上的主动权，而且掌握着军事上的主动权”，“人民战争使美国遭到一个又一个惨败。美国侵略军在（南越战场的）各条战线上都遭到了围攻。”
    这家报纸说，约翰逊之流正在扩大战争，妄图扭转不可扭转的局势。但是，“一切（战争）升级只有一个结果，那就是美国遭到更大的失败。”
    社论强调说，越南人民最近取得的伟大胜利再一次证实了这一信念：美帝国主义是可以打败的。
