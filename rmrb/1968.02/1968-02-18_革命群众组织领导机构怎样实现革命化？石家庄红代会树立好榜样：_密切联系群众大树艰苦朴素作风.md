With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the Shijiazhuang Red Guard Congress held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism to promote ideological revolutionization. They moved their office from a four-story building in the heart of the city to a simple classroom in a school, reduced the number of staff, and insisted on frugality to revolutionize.

The People's Daily reports: Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army, the Shijiazhuang Red Guard Congress took self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism as their main task, held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, and broke away from bureaucratism, fostering a spirit of hard work and simplicity. They moved the Red Guard Congress office from a well-equipped four-story building to a simple classroom in an ordinary school, which strengthened their ties with the masses and promoted ideological and work revolutionization.

The leaders of the Shijiazhuang Red Guard Congress, during the struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary trends from the right or ultra-left, wrote big-character posters and put up slogans with the Red Guards, always maintaining the spirit of an ordinary soldier, and became the strong leadership core of the Red Guards. However, after their positions changed, some comrades began to seek comfort and extravagance, paying less attention to hard work and simplicity, and being wasteful. They started printing envelopes and stationery, and even hired several cooks to prepare meals. The organizational structure became large and complex, and the office moved from a school to a four-story building in the city center. Some comrades no longer went deep into the masses, and big and small matters were often communicated by telephone, which weakened their emotional ties with the Red Guards, and gave rise to the airs of officials and arrogance. The Red Guards reflected, "Now the Red Guard Congress has become big and luxurious, and it is far away from us."

The PLA comrades stationed at the Red Guard Congress discovered this situation and immediately conducted an analysis and study, believing that this was a reflection of the incompleteness of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois revolution in the new situation, and a major issue related to whether a reliable successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause could be cultivated and whether the Cultural Revolution could be carried through to the end. If this trend continued, it would inevitably be hit by the "sugar-coated bullets" and go astray.

What should be done? The PLA comrades helped the leaders of the Red Guard Congress to hold a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on the question of "How to be a revolutionary who is determined to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end." They first organized the study of Mao Zedong's latest instructions and Mao Zedong's teachings in the report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee on "winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li... We must ensure that comrades continue to maintain a humble, prudent, and unassuming style, and we must ensure that comrades continue to maintain a spirit of hard struggle." Then they guided everyone to link their thoughts with reality and had a full discussion. Through study and discussion, the majority of comrades realized that whether or not to maintain a spirit of hard struggle is a major issue of whether the revolution can be carried through to the end. To maintain this spirit forever, one must never leave the masses and consciously be a student of the masses, and resolutely fight against the "self" in one's mind and constantly revolutionize oneself.

The PLA comrades also invited revolutionary cadres who had made mistakes during the Cultural Revolution to the study class to share their painful lessons of detaching from the masses and making mistakes, helping everyone to raise their awareness and arouse their self-revolutionary consciousness. Everyone was greatly shocked and said, "Making mistakes, no matter how many mistakes, the fundamental mistake is forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings and detaching from the masses." "We must not take this wrong path, otherwise, 'overthrowing the landlord and becoming a young master,' the country will change color." Everyone stood up to examine their thoughts and actions, and resolutely fought against the "self" in their minds. They decided to improve their style and maintain close ties with the masses. Some comrades proposed that the Red Guard Congress was located in the city center, with a large organizational structure, which was not convenient for contact with the students and for leading the revolution, and suggested simplifying the organization and moving the office to the school. This initiative sparked a debate, with the majority agreeing, but a few disagreeing. They felt that they were leading tens of thousands of Red Guards, how could they do with fewer people? How could they work without a larger office? Why bother with this?

In response to the above situation, the PLA comrades helped them to study Mao Zedong's teachings on the one hand and discuss two issues on the other: How to avoid detaching from the masses? What kind of leadership should the Red Guard Congress establish? Everyone discussed heatedly. Few people, can't lead? Many comrades said, Chairman Mao taught us to "streamline administration and personnel," we should resolutely implement it. The problem is not whether there are many or few people, the key is the revolutionization of the thoughts of the leaders of the Red Guard Congress. As for the office location, as long as there is a room, it is enough. We are far away from the school, living in high-rise buildings, which is itself a manifestation of detaching from the masses. If we continue like this, we will inevitably become complacent and become revisionist seedlings. The more they talked, the clearer their minds became, and the deeper their understanding. Then, everyone linked the lessons from the previous period of work, and thoroughly discussed the harm of bureaucratization in revolutionary mass organizations. They summarized it into several major harms: bureaucratization would lead to being high above the masses; bureaucratization would foster officialdom, issuing orders and chaotic commands; bureaucratization would lead to detachment from the fiery revolutionary struggle practice; bureaucratization would waste manpower and resources, which is not conducive to frugality and revolution; bureaucratization would create a breeding ground for revisionism, which is not conducive to ideological revolutionization.

Through study and discussion, everyone reached a consensus and decided to build the Red Guard Congress into a lean, close-to-the-masses, and revolutionary leadership organization. Therefore, they went deep into the masses, based on the broad consultation of opinions, and took revolutionary measures: they moved the Red Guard Congress to a simple classroom in the Anti-Revisionism War School of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University; the number of personnel was reduced from the original 63 to 17; the majority of the standing committee members of the Red Guard Congress were long-term stationed in various schools, participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, and setting an example in learning, propagating, executing, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Now, the spirit and work style of the Red Guard Congress comrades have been renewed. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings on "insisting on the mass line, consulting with the masses on every matter, and being a student of the masses," insisting on eating, living, and revolutionizing with the students. Where there are the most difficulties, where there are the most complex problems, they go there to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. No matter how far the distance, they never take a car. When arranging work and conveying instructions, they mostly go to various schools on foot to explain to the students. They also specially organized an educational revolution leadership group to grasp the typical cases, set examples, and promote the in-depth development of the educational revolution throughout the city. They carried forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity, saved expenses, and did not waste a single cent, even using old newspapers to make envelopes. The broad Red Guards reflected: "Our Red Guard Congress is indeed a revolutionary 'command center,' it fully represents our will."

    革命群众组织领导机构怎样实现革命化？石家庄红代会树立好榜样：
    密切联系群众大树艰苦朴素作风
    在解放军帮助下，开办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，促进思想革命化，把办公地点从一座地处闹市的四层大楼搬到一所学校的简陋的平房，减少工作人员，坚持节约闹革命
    本报讯　河北省石家庄红代会在解放军的帮助下，以斗私，批修为纲，开办毛泽东思想学习班，大破机关化，大树艰苦朴素的工作作风。他们把红代会的办公地点从一座设备齐全的四层楼房，搬到一个普通学校的平房里，密切了与群众的联系，促进了思想革命化和工作革命化。
    石家庄红代会的负责人，过去在同党内一小撮走资派和来自右的或极“左”的反动思潮斗争的日子里，和全市红卫兵一起写大字报，贴标语，一起战斗，始终保持普通一兵的本色，成为红卫兵坚强的领导核心。可是，当地位发生变化以后，有些同志开始讲排场，摆阔气，不大注意艰苦朴素、勤俭节约了，花钱有点大手大脚，信封、信纸开始印了，还专门请了几个大师傅做饭。组织机构庞大了、复杂了，办公地点从一个学校搬到了闹市中心的一座四层大楼。部分同志不象以前那样深入群众，大事小事往往都用电话通知，同广大红卫兵的感情疏远了，产生了“官”、“娇”二气。红卫兵纷纷反映说：“现在红代会大了，阔了，离咱们也远了。”
    驻红代会的解放军同志发现这种情况后，立即进行了分析研究，认为这是资产阶级、小资产阶级革命的不彻底性在新形势下的反映，是关系到能否造就无产阶级革命事业坚强可靠的接班人，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大问题。如果这样下去，势必会被“糖衣炮弹”击中，走到邪路上去。
    怎么办呢？解放军同志帮助红代会负责人员，围绕“怎样才能做一个决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”的问题，开办了一期毛泽东思想学习班。首先组织他们反复学习毛主席的最新指示和毛主席在七届二中全会报告中关于“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导。然后引导大家联系思想实际，进行了充分的讨论。经过学习、讨论，绝大部分同志认识到，能否保持艰苦奋斗的作风，是能不能将革命进行到底的一个大问题。要想永远保持这种作风，就必须永远不脱离群众，自觉地甘当群众的小学生，狠斗头脑中的“私”字，不断革自己的命。
    解放军同志又邀请在文化大革命中犯过错误的革命干部，到学习班来介绍自己以前脱离群众、犯错误的沉痛教训，帮助大家提高认识，激发大家自我革命的自觉性。大家听了，震动很大，都说：“犯错误，千错万错，根本的错误就是忘了毛主席的教导，脱离了群众。”“我们可不能走这条歪路，要不，‘打倒老爷，上来少爷’，国家就得变色。”大家纷纷起来检查自己的思想和行动，狠斗灵魂深处的“私”字。决心改进作风，密切联系群众。有的同志提出，红代会位于闹市，机构庞大，不便于和广大同学联系，不便于领导教育革命，应该精简机构，把办公地点搬到学校去。这一倡议引起了争论，大多数人赞同，但是有少数人不同意。他们觉得，我们领导着几万红卫兵，人少了怎么行？没有个大点的办公地点怎么工作？何必多此一举！
    针对上述情况，解放军同志帮助他们一面学习毛主席有关教导，一面讨论了这样两个问题：怎样才能不脱离群众？红代会应该建立一个什么样的领导机构？大家讨论得很热烈。人少，就不能领导了吗？许多同志说，毛主席教导我们“精兵简政”，我们应该坚决照办。问题不在人多人少，关键在于红代会负责人的思想革命化。至于办公地点，有个房子就可以了，我们远离学校，住在高楼大厦，本身就是脱离群众的表现，这样下去，势必养尊处优，变成修正主义苗子。大家越谈心里越亮堂，认识越深刻。接着，大家又联系前一段工作中的教训，大摆革命群众组织搞机关化的危害性。他们归纳成几大害处：搞机关化，就会高高在上，脱离群众；搞机关化，就会助长官气，发号施令，乱指挥；搞机关化，就会脱离火热的革命斗争实践；搞机关化，就会浪费人力物力，不利于节约闹革命；搞机关化，就给修正主义制造了温床，不利于思想革命化。
    通过学习和讨论，大家统一了认识，决心把红代会建成一个精悍的、密切联系群众的、革命化的领导机构。于是，他们又深入群众，在广泛征求意见的基础上，采取了革命化措施：把红代会搬到学校比较集中、设备简陋的抗大反修战校的一间平房里；人员由原来的六十三人减少到十七人；红代会绝大部分常委都长期深入各学校，参加本单位的斗、批、改，做学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范。
    现在，红代会同志的精神面貌和工作作风焕然一新。他们遵照毛主席关于“坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，坚持和同学同吃、同住、同革命。那里困难最多，那里问题最复杂，他们就到那里落实毛主席最新指示。不管路程多远，他们从不坐车，布置工作、传达指示，大都是步行到各学校当面对同学们讲清。他们还专门组织了一个教育革命领导小组，抓典型，树样板，推动了全市教育革命的深入发展。他们发扬艰苦朴素的工作作风，节约开支，不乱花一分钱，就连信封也都用废报纸糊。广大红卫兵小将反映说：“咱们的红代会真是个革命化的‘司令部’，她完全代表了咱们的意志。”
