	Firmly Grasp the Lifeline of Political Work
	Jiang Jianmin, Political Instructor of a Certain Mechanized Company

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." This is a truth that applies universally.

	In 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing arbitrarily decided to hold a full military competition and to promote "technical experts." Some cadres unconsciously thought that a mechanized company relies solely on technical prowess. Therefore, they focused only on mechanics and neglected ideology, resulting in frequent accidents and uncompleted tasks. The facts tell us that as soon as the company deviates slightly from Chairman Mao's fundamental principles of political construction of the military, it will lose its way. Thus, we convened a party branch committee meeting, seriously studied the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the expanded meeting of the Military Commission, and raised our awareness, clarifying the relationship between politics and technology. Comrades said: "Politics is like a lighthouse; without politics, one is blind." "If politics does not take the lead, work will fail; if ideology does not lead, the direction will be wrong." From then on, we firmly grasped the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, placing political and ideological work in the foremost position.

	We worked on the plateau, where the high altitude lacks oxygen, but the enthusiasm for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works was very high. Everyone said: "The political atmosphere is dense, and we are not afraid of the thin natural air." The construction site was full of cliffs and precipices, countless "lion's mouths," and "tiger's jaws." Going to and from work required crossing several cliffs, climbing several iron ropes, crossing suspension bridges, and using rope ladders. Our soldiers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, overcame one difficulty after another and completed the task satisfactorily. Some teams had new soldiers and used old machinery, but they used the "Three Articles" as weapons, fought "private" thoughts thoroughly with "completely" and "thoroughly," and worked with an "extremely responsible" attitude towards work, finding many measures; not understanding the technology, they learned while operating. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, all the soldiers in our company, scattered across thirty-two points, completed the task excellently.

	If we were to follow the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing's fallacy of "technology first," it would inevitably lead people to focus on their work, detach from class struggle, and open the door wide for the spread of revisionist thoughts and the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, whether to place politics in the foremost position or to place technology in the foremost position, whether to grasp the ideological revolution of the people or to focus solely on technology, is a major issue concerning whether our proletarian army will change or not. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, firmly grasp the lifeline of political work, and build a company that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

    狠抓政治工作这条生命线
    某部机械连指导员　蒋建民
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”这是放之四海而皆准的真理。
    一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，擅自决定全军大比武，大树“技术尖子”。有的干部也不自觉地认为，机械连就是靠技术过硬。因此，只抓机械不问思想，结果不断地出现事故，任务完不成。事实告诉我们，连队只要稍微离开毛主席关于政治建军的根本原则，就会晕头转向。于是我们召开了党支部委员会，认真学习古田会议决议和军委扩大会议决议，大家提高了认识，弄清了政治和技术的关系。同志们说：“政治好比是灯塔，没有政治双眼瞎。”“政治不挂帅，工作准失败；思想不领先，方向必然偏。”从这以后，我们狠抓活学活用毛主席著作，把政治思想工作放在首要地位。
    我们在高原上施工，高山缺氧，大学大用毛主席著作的情绪却非常高涨。大家都说：“政治空气浓厚，不怕自然空气稀薄。”施工地段到处是悬崖绝壁，数不清的“狮子口”，“老虎嘴”，上下工都要过几道断崖，爬几道铁索，又是吊桥，又是绳梯。我们的战士，就凭着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，战胜了一个又一个困难，较好地完成了任务。有的机组里有新战士，使用的又是旧机械，但他们以“老三篇”为武器，用“完全”“彻底”狠斗“私”字，用“对工作的极端的负责任”的精神，大找措施；不懂技术，就边操作边学习。在毛泽东思想的照耀下，我们全连战士分散在三十二个点上作业，出色地完成了任务。
    如果按照反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿“技术第一”的谬论去作，就必然引导人们埋头业务，脱离阶级斗争，为修正主义思想泛滥、资本主义复辟大开方便之门。因此，是把政治放在首要地位，还是把技术放在首要地位，是抓人的思想革命化，还是单纯抓技术，是关系到我们无产阶级军队变不变质的大问题。我们一定彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的流毒，狠狠抓住政治工作这条生命线，建设一支永远忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想的连队。
