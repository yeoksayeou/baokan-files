"Long live the victory of people's war!" The representatives read aloud the words of the great leader Chairman Mao in his congratulatory telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho: "You have fought well! Under extremely difficult conditions, relying on your own strength, you have beaten the most ferocious American imperialism into a corner, making them desperate and disgraced. This is a great victory. The Chinese people salute you." Comrade Nian Siyang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, said, "The victory of the South Vietnamese people and military is a great victory of people's war. This victory greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and greatly dampens the arrogance of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries." The representatives unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and with actual actions, support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the war of resistance against American aggression to the end.

The farmers of the Zhongyue Friendship People's Commune, who have deep affection for the Vietnamese people, were overjoyed upon hearing the news of the special bulletin issued by the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam. They excitedly said, "The Vietnamese brothers fought well, truly a great relief. The Vietnamese brothers have fully demonstrated the immense power of people's war, bringing it to a new level." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their determination to learn from the Vietnamese brothers' daring to struggle, daring to win, and fearless revolutionary spirit.

The second special bulletin issued by the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam greatly encouraged the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses of all fronts in Shanghai. They excitedly said that the South Vietnamese people and military, with their fearless revolutionary spirit, launched a comprehensive offensive and inflicted a crushing defeat on the American aggressors, achieving brilliant results. This is the greatest encouragement to us and to revolutionary people all over the world. We must learn better from the Vietnamese brothers' fearless, self-sacrificing revolutionary spirit.

The Public Utilities Management Bureau of Shanghai and the Public Transportation Company held a victory celebration meeting. When the special bulletin issued by the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam was read, the entire venue erupted in cheers, with fists raised high shouting, "The Vietnamese people will win! The American imperialists will lose! Long live the victory of people's war! Long live Chairman Hu Chi Minh! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" The responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee of the Public Transportation Company said at the meeting: The complete defeat of American imperialism in Vietnam is not far off. However, the enemy will not give up easily and will surely make a desperate struggle. The Vietnamese people will have to go through a period of arduous struggle to achieve complete victory. The great leader Chairman Mao said, "Persistence is victory." We firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the Vietnamese people who dare to struggle and dare to win.

The workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary students, and alley residents of Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, Shanghai Tractor Factory, Tongji University, Fenglin Street in Xuhui District, and Jiangzhen Commune in Chuansha County all held victory celebration meetings and various celebration activities today.

Team leader Nguyen Ngoc Trinh said in his speech: This victory of the southern people and military once again proves that no matter how powerful the enemy's weapons are, they cannot intimidate the brave Vietnamese people. No matter how crazy the American imperialists are, we will fight to the end. The more crazy the enemy is, the more it shows the enemy's weakness. All Vietnamese people, for the liberation of the South, the defense of the North, and the unification of the country, have the determination to fight to the end. No matter what weapons the American imperialists use, no matter how much they escalate the war, our determination to resist American aggression and save the country is unshakable. The final victory will definitely belong to us.

They unanimously pointed out: The great leader Chairman Mao said, "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The victory of the South Vietnamese people not only disrupted the American imperialists' war plans in Vietnam but also more broadly mobilized the Vietnamese people in cities and countryside to join the great war of resistance against American aggression, surrounding the American imperialist paper tiger in the vast ocean of people's war.

The soldiers and officers of the 6955th Unit of the People's Liberation Army, who are carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in Qinghutang, also participated in the celebration meeting.

They spread the news, warmly celebrated, and expressed their warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese trainees, holding celebration meetings with them.

The great leader Chairman Mao said, "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." Deputy Director Zhao Hongzhou of the Revolutionary Committee of Tianjin First Machine Tool Factory, representing all the workers of the factory, said at the celebration meeting that the heroic spring victory of the South Vietnamese people fully proves the immense power of people's war. The American imperialist paper tiger has been beaten by the Vietnamese people into a state of panic and disarray, which is truly a great relief.

He expressed his determination that the Tianjin working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will, together with the people of the whole country, firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the war of resistance against American aggression to the end and be a strong backbone for the Vietnamese people.

The leader of the Vietnamese trainee team, Nguyen Dang Hiep, introduced the brilliant victory of the spring offensive at the meeting and thanked the Chinese people for their great support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression.

The workers responsible for training in Tianjin Machine Tool Factory and other factories said, "The people of China and Vietnam are close comrades-in-arms. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is our struggle, and the victory of the Vietnamese people is our victory. We must learn from the Vietnamese people's fearless, self-sacrificing revolutionary spirit. We firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the heroic Vietnamese people."

The news of the South Vietnamese people and military's spring victory spread to Guangzhou, and the soldiers and officers of the Guangzhou troops held celebration meetings and discussion meetings, warmly celebrating this great victory. The soldiers and officers stationed at Huangpu Port, who are responsible for supporting the left, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Seven hundred million Chinese people are the strong backing of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area for the Vietnamese people.' The Chinese people and the Vietnamese people are brothers who share weal and woe. The cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression is our cause, and every victory of the Vietnamese people inspires the seven hundred million Chinese people. We will definitely support the struggle of our Vietnamese brothers with our actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production." The soldiers and officers of the 38th Line Spearhead Hero Company of a certain regiment of the Guangzhou troops, who had once fought against the American imperialist paper tiger on the Korean battlefield, praised the Vietnamese people's victory in the discussion and expressed their determination to firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying out the struggle against American aggression to the end.
