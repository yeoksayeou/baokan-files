The two major revolutionary mass organizations at the Ba Yi Steel Plant, the largest enterprise in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have achieved revolutionary great unity under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This sets a good example for the realization of revolutionary great unity in the Urumqi region.

The two major revolutionary mass organizations in this plant, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, began holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes together starting from late October last year. One-third of the plant's total workforce has participated in these study classes. During the classes, the two factions of revolutionary masses repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, earnestly engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, sincerely conducted self-criticism, gradually eliminated misunderstandings, and strengthened unity.

With the help of the stationed PLA, the leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations reached an agreement on February 9 to achieve revolutionary great unity. On February 12, they established the Ba Yi Steel Plant Revolutionary Great Unity Committee. Subsequently, all workshops and teams in the plant united within three days.

The revolutionary workers of the entire plant held a celebration meeting to commemorate the achievement of revolutionary great unity. Representatives from the Xinjiang Military Region, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and the 7335 Unit all came to offer warm congratulations.

    新疆八一钢铁厂两大派实现革命大联合
    新疆维吾尔自治区最大的企业——八一钢铁厂两大派革命群众组织，在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下，胜利地实现了革命大联合，为乌鲁木齐地区实现革命大联合树立了良好的榜样。
    这个厂的两大派革命群众组织，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，从去年十月下旬，就联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，全厂参加学习的已占职工总数的三分之一。在学习班上，两派革命群众反复学习毛主席的最新指示，认真斗私批修，诚恳地进行自我批评，逐渐消除了隔阂，增强了团结。
    两派革命群众组织负责人在驻厂解放军的帮助下，在二月九日达成实现革命大联合的协议以后，在二月十二日成立了八一钢铁厂革命大联合委员会。随后，全厂各车间、班组也在三天内纷纷联合起来。
    全厂革命职工举行了欢庆实现革命大联合大会。新疆军区、新疆军区生产建设兵团和七三三五部队的代表，都前往热烈祝贺。
