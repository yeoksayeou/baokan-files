The puppet troops stationed in Phu Tho Province, Van Dien District, Bu Chi outpost, frequently raided nearby villages to loot property and livestock, killing civilians, and arbitrarily arresting people. They were truly evil incarnate. The guerrilla forces had repeatedly issued stern warnings and given them the punishment they deserved. However, these habitual criminals showed no signs of stopping. The guerrilla fighters decided to punish these thugs and demand justice for the bloodshed.

One afternoon, the clever and brave guerrilla fighters ingeniously converted two unexploded enemy shells into landmines and set them up near the enemy outpost. Then, three guerrilla fighters bravely approached the barbed wire fence of the outpost and shouted loudly to the puppet troops inside, aiming to lure the enemy out.

Wave after wave of shouts from the guerrilla fighters echoed into the outpost. The puppet officer, upon hearing this, flew into a rage, displaying a mix of ferocity and weakness. He hastily gathered the puppet troops, attempting to capture the shouting guerrilla fighters. The puppet troops, like a pack of vicious dogs, rushed out of the outpost.

The three guerrilla fighters saw that their goal of luring the enemy out had been achieved, so they turned and ran back. The foolish enemy, led by the nose, chased after them frantically. After running just a few hundred meters, the two landmines set by the guerrilla fighters exploded. Before the enemy could even think about what happened, twenty-five of them were blown to pieces. The remaining eleven enemies were all injured, scrambling back to their lair in panic.

After this severe punishment by the guerrilla forces, the puppet troops in the Bu Chi outpost no longer dared to recklessly raid nearby villages.

    用敌人的炮弹消灭敌人
    驻在承天省风田县普泽据点的伪军，经常跑到邻近的村子里，抢劫财物和牲畜，杀害老百姓，随意抓人，真是无恶不作。游击队多次向他们提出严厉警告，并给予应得惩罚。但是，这些作恶成性的家伙，毫无收敛。游击队员们决心惩罚这些恶棍，向他们讨还血债。
    一天下午，机智勇敢的游击队员把敌人的两颗没有爆炸的炮弹巧妙地改装成地雷，埋伏在敌人据点附近。然后，三个游击队员勇敢地靠近敌人据点的铁丝网，向据点里的伪军大声喊话，以便把敌人引出来。
    一阵阵游击队员的喊话声传进据点，伪军军官一听暴跳如雷，显出一副既凶恶又虚弱的狼狈相。他匆匆忙忙把伪军集合起来，企图去抓喊话的游击队员。伪军象一群恶狗一样，从据点里扑了出来。
    三个游击队员看到已达到诱敌上钩的目的，扭头就往回跑，愚蠢的敌人昏头昏脑被牵着鼻子，在后面拚命追。跑出仅几百米远，游击队员们巧妙设置的两颗地雷爆炸了。敌人连想也来不及想是怎么回事，就有二十五个人被炸得粉身碎骨。剩下的十一个敌人统统被炸伤，抱头鼠窜，慌忙逃回巢穴。
    普泽据点里的伪军，经过游击队这次严厉惩罚，再也不敢放肆地跑到邻近村子里去胡作非为了。
