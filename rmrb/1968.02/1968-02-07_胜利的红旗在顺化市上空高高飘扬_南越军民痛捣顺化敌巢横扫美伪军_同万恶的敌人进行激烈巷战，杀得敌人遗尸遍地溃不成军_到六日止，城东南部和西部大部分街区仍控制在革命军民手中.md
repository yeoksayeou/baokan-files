The triumphant red flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are flying high over the skies of Hue City. The military and civilian population of South Vietnam have launched a fierce assault on the enemy stronghold in Hue, sweeping away the American and puppet forces. They have engaged in intense street battles with the evil enemy, leaving the enemy's corpses scattered and their forces in disarray.

By the 6th, the eastern, southern, and western parts of the city were still under the control of the revolutionary military and civilian population.

Hanoi, February 6 (New China News Agency) - In recent days, the armed forces of the people's liberation and other revolutionary forces in South Vietnam have achieved brilliant victories in Hue City by annihilating and severely damaging American and puppet forces. The military and civilian population of this heroic city have displayed a tenacious and daring fighting spirit, engaging in fierce street battles with the evil enemy. The enemy has been left in disarray, their corpses scattered, and their forces in retreat. By the 6th, the eastern, southern, and western parts of the ancient city were still under the control of the revolutionary military and civilian population. The heroic and victorious flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are flying high in the skies of this heroic city.

According to preliminary reports from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, from January 31 to February 4, the military and civilian population of Hue City annihilated and severely damaged three armored regiments, seven battalions, ten companies, and ten platoons of American and puppet forces. They shot down or destroyed more than fifty aircraft, sank four gunboats, destroyed or captured nearly fifty military vehicles, occupied five warehouses, destroyed five bridges, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The people's liberation armed forces and the people also captured or forced hundreds of enemy soldiers to surrender, including many puppet military and political leaders and many American "advisors."

Hue is the third-largest city in South Vietnam. Many important military and political institutions of the American and puppet forces in North Vietnam are located here. The enemy has heavily fortified this city, not only building many strongholds around the city but also constructing a defensive system consisting of many fortifications on the outskirts. However, the heroic military and civilian population of South Vietnam have swept through the enemy's defenses like a storm.

At 2:45 AM on January 31, the liberation armed forces of Quang Tri-Thua Thien, with the full support of the people, launched a large-scale attack on the enemy positions in the city and suburbs. With the active help of many patriotic soldiers in the puppet army, the liberation armed forces quickly destroyed the enemy's strongholds, rapidly capturing one enemy position after another. In just thirty-five minutes of fighting, the liberation armed forces had entered the city, occupied the main streets in the city center, and advanced into other parts of the city.

On the morning of February 1, the revolutionary military and civilian population launched a powerful attack on the enemy, destroying many of their positions and annihilating hundreds of enemy soldiers. At the same time, the liberation armed forces and the people launched a fan-shaped offensive, attacking the remaining enemy positions in the city, especially in the southern region, with even greater ferocity. In just one hour of fighting, the liberation armed forces had occupied the residence of the puppet provincial governor, the offices of the puppet government representatives in the northern provinces, and other important enemy institutions, dissolving many puppet military units and administrative organizations, and capturing a large number of puppet officials. Many puppet soldiers and officials surrendered to the people and turned their guns on their former comrades, seeking to redeem themselves.

On the afternoon and evening of February 2, the hastily dispatched American Marine Corps and puppet paratroopers attempted to retake the city from several directions. However, the liberation armed forces had occupied advantageous positions, raining down heavy fire from the city gates and walls, striking the enemy like startled birds. The enemy attempted to break through the southern gate of Hue four times but were repelled each time, suffering heavy losses.

The desperate American invaders then dispatched a large number of aircraft to bomb the city indiscriminately and released poison gas to massacre the residents. However, the enemy's heinous crimes only fueled the hatred of the military and civilian population of Hue, making their fighting spirit even more ardent. They dealt the enemy even heavier blows.

At dawn on the 3rd, the liberation armed forces launched an attack on the Phu Cam Prison. The more than 2,200 patriots imprisoned there, with the cooperation of some patriotic soldiers in the puppet army, broke down the prison gates, punished the prison guards, armed themselves with weapons seized from the enemy, and immediately joined the battle, pursuing the fleeing enemy and expanding their victories alongside the liberation armed forces.

That day, the military and civilian population of Hue also attacked the heavily fortified Phu Bai stronghold, killing more than 200 enemy soldiers and capturing more than 300 in just thirty minutes of fighting. That night, the revolutionary armed forces attacked the Hue railway station and used mortars to shell the military training center in the western part of Hue City.

On February 4, while ambushing eight battalions of American and puppet forces attempting to counterattack, the military and civilian population of Hue annihilated more than 200 enemy soldiers, destroying six M-113 armored vehicles. They also destroyed the Long An bunker, capturing an American platoon and an American colonel.

That day, the military and civilian population of Hue also attacked the enemy's logistics area in the southern part of the city, annihilating the enemy's motorized supply company and seizing weapons and ammunition stored in five warehouses.

Under the fierce attacks of the people's revolutionary armed forces, more than 100 puppet soldiers and officers in the southern part of Hue City surrendered to the people, bringing their weapons with them.

During the intense days and nights of battle, more and more people from all walks of life in Hue City took up arms, joining the fighting ranks and cooperating with the liberation armed forces. As soon as the sound of the attack guns rang out, the people in the city and suburbs rushed to the streets, punishing and capturing hundreds of heinous enemy and puppet elements hiding in various places, shattering the puppet government's control over most of the city and surrounding areas. They also launched a surprise attack on the enemy stronghold on the city's flag tower. They climbed the high walls, tore down the puppet government's flag, and raised the brilliant red-blue flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. More than 1,000 students and young people in Hue City volunteered to join the uprising army, many of whom established numerous merits in battle and became "brave warriors against the Americans."

Thousands of residents from five wards in the city joined the civilian defense forces and became members of the mass organizations led by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The great victory has brought joy and enthusiasm to the people of Hue. Residents in many neighborhoods held meetings, vowing to continue fighting side by side with the revolutionary armed forces, striking the enemy, and achieving even greater victories.

    胜利的红旗在顺化市上空高高飘扬
    南越军民痛捣顺化敌巢横扫美伪军
    同万恶的敌人进行激烈巷战，杀得敌人遗尸遍地溃不成军
    到六日止，城东南部和西部大部分街区仍控制在革命军民手中
    新华社河内六日电  越南南方人民解放武装力量和其他革命武装最近几天在顺化市内痛歼美伪军，取得了辉煌的战果。这座英雄城市的军民发扬了顽强果敢的战斗作风，同万恶的敌人进行了激烈的巷战，杀得敌人丢盔弃甲，遗尸遍地，溃不成军。到六日为止，这个古城的东南部和西部的大部分街区，仍然控制在革命军民手中，越南南方民族解放阵线的英雄的胜利的旗帜，在英雄城市的上空迎风飘扬。
    据越南南方解放通讯社初步消息，从一月三十一日到二月四日，顺化市的军民歼灭和重创美伪军三个装甲团、七个营、十个连和十个排，击落击毁飞机五十多架，击沉炮艇四艘，摧毁或缴获军用汽车近五十辆，占领仓库五座，破坏桥梁五座，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    人民解放武装力量和人民还俘虏或迫使数以百计的敌军投降，其中包括许多伪军政头目和许多美国“顾问”。
    顺化是南越的第三座大城市，美伪军在南越北部的许多重要军政机构都设在这里。敌人在这座城市里布置了重兵防守，除了在城的四周修筑了许多坚固据点外，在城的外围还有一道由很多工事构成的防御系统。但是，敌人的任何工事布防，都阻挡不了英雄的南越军民势如暴风骤雨的猛烈进军。
    一月三十一日凌晨二时四十五分，广治—承天解放武装力量得到人民的全力支持，对市区和郊区的敌军阵地发动了大规模进攻。在伪军许多爱国官兵的积极帮助下，解放武装力量把敌军据点打得稀烂，迅速摧毁了敌军的一个又一个阵地，仅仅经过三十五分钟的战斗，解放武装力量就攻入市区，占领了市中心的主要街区，并向市内的其他地区挺进。
    二月一日上午，革命军民对敌人发动强大的进攻，摧毁了敌人的许多阵地，消灭了数百名敌军。同时，解放武装力量和人民展开扇形攻势，对整个城市，特别是南部地区的残余敌军阵地进行了更加猛烈的攻击。在一小时的战斗中，解放武装力量就占领了伪省长的住所、伪政府在北部各省的代表的办事处等敌伪重要机关，瓦解了许多伪军部队和伪行政机构，俘虏了大批伪政权恶棍。大批伪军官兵纷纷向人民投诚，并掉转枪口，争取为人民立功。
    二月二日下午和晚上，被仓促派来增援的美国海军陆战队和伪军伞兵，从几个方向推进，企图重新占领这个城市。但是，解放武装力量占据了有利地形，从城门和城墙上，居高临下，以密集的炮火猛袭如惊弓之鸟的敌人。敌人曾经四次企图突破顺化城的南门，但是四次都被击退了。敌人又一次遭到了严重的损失。
    被打得焦头烂额的美国侵略者这时出动大批飞机，对城市进行狂轰滥炸，并施放毒气残杀居民。但是，敌人的滔天罪行激起了顺化军民更大的仇恨，使他们的斗志更加昂扬。他们给了敌人以更加沉重的打击。
    三日破晓，解放武装力量向承富监狱发起进攻。被监禁在这个监狱里的二千二百多名爱国者，在伪军中一些爱国士兵的合作下，起来砸烂了狱门，惩罚了监狱看守，用缴获敌人的武器武装自己，立即投入战斗，同解放武装力量一道，追击逃敌，扩大战果。
    当天，顺化军民还袭击了敌人重兵防守的福戈据点，在三十分钟的战斗中，当场打死敌军二百名，俘虏三百多名。当天夜里，革命武装力量袭击了顺化火车站，并用迫击炮轰击了顺化市西部的龙坡军事训练中心。
    二月四日，顺化军民在狙击前来企图进行反扑的八个营美伪军时，又歼敌二百多名，烧毁Ｍ—113型装甲车六辆。他们还摧毁了龙安地堡，俘虏美军一个排和一名美军上校。
    这天，顺化军民还攻打了顺化市南部的敌人后勤地区，歼灭了敌人摩托化供应营，缴获了五座仓库中存放的武器和弹药。
    在人民革命武装力量的猛烈攻击下，驻守在顺化市南部的一百多名伪军官兵，带着他们的武器向人民投诚。
    在紧张战斗的日日夜夜，越来越多的顺化市各阶层人民，纷纷奋起投入战斗的行列，配合解放武装力量作战。当进攻的枪声一响，市区和郊区的人民立刻涌向街头，惩罚和捉拿了躲藏在各处的几百名罪大恶极的敌伪分子，粉碎了伪政权对城市的大部分地区和周围地区的控制。他们还对城内旗塔上的敌军据点发动奇袭。他们爬上高墙，扯下了伪政权的旗子，升起了光辉灿烂的越南南方民族解放阵线的金星红蓝旗。顺化市一千多名学生和青年志愿参加起义军，他们中许多人在战斗中建立了许多战功，成了“歼美勇士”。
    市内五个街区的数千居民参加了民卫队，并加入了越南南方民族解放阵线领导的群众组织。
    巨大的胜利使顺化人民欢欣鼓舞，许多居民区的人民纷纷举行集会，誓同革命武装力量继续并肩战斗，打击敌人，夺取更大的胜利。
