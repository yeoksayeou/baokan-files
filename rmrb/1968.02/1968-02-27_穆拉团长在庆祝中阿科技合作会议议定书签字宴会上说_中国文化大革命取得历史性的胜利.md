Chairman Mura, at the banquet celebrating the signing of the agreement on the 12th session of the Sino-Albanian Scientific and Technological Cooperation Conference, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao has achieved historic victories. The Party and people of Albania regard every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as our victory, as the victory of all genuine revolutionaries in the world.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen of the State Council attended the banquet. The banquet was hosted by Sun Xiaofeng, Deputy Minister of the Petroleum Industry.

Chairman Mura said in his speech that the great and sincere revolutionary friendship between the two parties and peoples of Albania and China is based on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It has been tempered and tested in the struggle against our common enemies—imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. Therefore, it is invincible. No matter what vicious plots the imperialists and their lackeys concoct, they will inevitably suffer a shameful failure.

Sun Xiaofeng spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He warmly praised the thriving revolutionary movement in Albania and wished that the great socialist beacon of Europe, Albania, would continue to shine even more brightly. He said that in the struggle for socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the fight against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, the two parties and peoples of China and Albania have always supported each other and fought side by side. We will forever stand together, fight together, and win together.

Ambassador Natanaeli of Albania to China was also invited to attend the banquet. Those present at the banquet also included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua and others.

    穆拉团长在庆祝中阿科技合作会议议定书签字宴会上说
    中国文化大革命取得历史性的胜利
    新华社二十六日讯　阿尔巴尼亚政府科技代表团团长普罗科普·穆拉，今晚在北京出席庆祝中阿科技合作第十二届会议议定书签字的宴会上说，毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了历史性的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚党和人民把中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的每一个胜利，都看成是我们的胜利，看成是世界上一切真正革命派的胜利。
    国务院副总理聂荣臻出席了宴会。宴会是由石油部副部长孙晓风举行的。
    普罗科普·穆拉团长在讲话中说，阿中两党和两国人民的伟大真诚的革命友谊，是建立在不朽的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的，是在反对共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，经受了重大考验和锤炼的，因此它是不可战胜的。帝国主义及其帮凶不管策划什么恶毒阴谋，都必将遭到可耻的失败。
    孙晓风在宴会开始时讲话，他热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚蓬勃开展的革命化运动，并且祝愿阿尔巴尼亚这盏欧洲的伟大的社会主义明灯，继续放出更加灿烂的光芒。他说，在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的斗争中，中阿两党、两国人民一向是互相支援，并肩战斗的。我们将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳塔奈利应邀出席了宴会。出席宴会的还有外交部副部长乔冠华等。
