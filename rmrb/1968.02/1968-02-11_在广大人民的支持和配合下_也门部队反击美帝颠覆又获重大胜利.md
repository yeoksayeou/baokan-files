With the support and cooperation of the broad masses of the Yemeni people, the Yemeni armed forces and people's militia have achieved another major victory in their struggle against the armed subversion of the Yemeni Republic by U.S. imperialism and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries.

The Yemeni armed forces have won battles on various fronts, including west and southwest of the capital Sana'a. In recent days, they have killed and wounded hundreds of enemy troops and seized a large number of American-made guns, cannons, and ammunition.

With the strong support of the Yemeni people, the Yemeni armed forces on the 6th opened the Sana'a-Hodeidah road, foiling the evil scheme of U.S. imperialism and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries to besiege Sana'a by blocking this road.

After the good news arrived, thousands of people in Sana'a took to the streets to celebrate this victory. When Chinese friends congratulated the Yemeni people on their victory, they enthusiastically surrounded the Chinese friends, shook hands tightly, and raised their arms, shouting, "Long live Yemeni-Chinese friendship! Long live Chairman Mao! The U.S. imperialists will be defeated, and Yemen will be victorious!" A soldier excitedly told the reporter, "As long as the Yemeni people unite and persist in the struggle, any enemy can be defeated."

    也门部队反击美帝颠覆又获重大胜利
    新华社萨那六日电  也门武装部队和人民自卫队在广大也门人民的支持和配合下，在反击美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派策划的武装颠覆也门共和政权的战斗中，又取得了重大的胜利。
    也门武装部队在也门首都萨那以西和西南部等各个战场上都打了胜仗。连日来，他们打死打伤敌军数百名，缴获了敌人许多美国制造的枪炮和弹药。
    也门武装部队在也门人民的大力支持下，六日打通了萨那—荷台达公路，粉碎了美帝国主义和沙特阿拉伯反动派妄图用封锁这条公路来围困萨那的罪恶阴谋计划。
    捷报传来后，萨那成百上千的群众涌向街头，热烈庆祝这一胜利。当中国朋友向也门人民祝贺他们的胜利的时候，他们热情地把中国朋友围起来，紧紧地握手，并振臂高呼：“也中人民友谊万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“美帝必败，也门必胜！”一位战士激动地对记者说：“只要也门人民团结起来，坚持斗争，任何敌人都是可以打败的。”
