The naval aviation unit of the People's Liberation Army held a victory celebration and award ceremony in a southern location this afternoon. The event honored the personnel and units that successfully shot down and damaged one U.S. Navy A-1H carrier-based attack aircraft each on February 14 over the skies of Hainan Island. The ceremony encouraged all personnel to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further deepen the great mass movement of learning from Comrade Lin Biao, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are determined to achieve new victories in the great struggle to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and national defense.

The central part of the stage was adorned with a large portrait of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's inscription for the Navy: "To oppose imperialist aggression, we must build a powerful navy." Comrade Lin Biao's inscription for the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Navy: "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." These inscriptions shone brightly around the venue.

The meeting began with the enthusiastic shout of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and the majestic song "The East Is Red." The troops repeatedly read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "Spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," "Criticize and repudiate revisionism," and "Grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." Attendees included naval leaders Wang Hongkun, Guangzhou Military Region leader Yang Meisheng, and leaders from the South Sea Fleet, East Sea Fleet, and Naval Aviation, such as Zhou Zhixian and Gao Zhirong, as well as over a thousand troops from the army, navy, and air force.

Wang Hongkun read the commendation order on behalf of the Central Military Commission and awarded revolutionary books such as "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Poems of Chairman Mao," and shining Mao badges to the meritorious personnel.

Wang Hongkun spoke at the meeting. He first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Navy Party Committee and the Navy leadership to all the troops who participated in the battle. He pointed out that this air battle victory is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a major achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a major achievement of the battle units in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The most distinctive feature of this air battle victory is that all the troops participating in the battle, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, commanded the battle with Mao Zedong Thought. This fact once again proves that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, fearless of death, and invincible.

Wang Hongkun encouraged the troops to further fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to be models in learning, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to firmly implement the policy of supporting the left without supporting factions, to do a good job in the "three supports" and "two militaries," and to love and support the military. They should better shoulder the glorious tasks of defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Wang Hongkun finally pointed out that after suffering a setback, U.S. imperialism will not give up and will certainly continue to provoke wars against our country and even launch new military adventures. We must be vigilant, strengthen our preparedness, and be ready to annihilate the invading enemy at any time to achieve greater victories.

Yang Meisheng then spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that recently, U.S. imperialism, in order to reverse its defeat in Vietnam, has been colluding with the Soviet revisionist clique and various reactionaries to expand the Vietnam War, attempting to spread the war to the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia. U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance and do a good job in preparedness. If the enemy dares to take risks and impose a war on us, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate it.

Chen Wulu, a deputy squadron leader who was awarded first-class merit in this air battle, spoke on behalf of the meritorious personnel. He firmly stated that he would unswervingly learn from Comrade Lin Biao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great teachings on grasping revolution and promoting preparedness, heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and achieve new victories for the people in defending Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The meeting concluded with the song "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman."

    更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗再接再厉为人民立新功
    海军航空兵某部举行祝捷授奖大会
    大会宣读中央军委嘉奖令，表扬击落击伤美帝舰载攻击机各一架的有功人员和单位。广大指战员决心百倍提高警惕，加强战备，务歼入侵之敌
    新华社十八日讯　中国人民解放军海军航空兵某部，今天下午在南方某地隆重举行祝捷授奖大会，表扬二月十四日在海南岛上空一举击落击伤美国海军A—1H型舰载攻击机各一架的作战有功人员和单位。大会勉励全体指战员全面落实毛主席的最新指示，进一步深入开展以林副主席为光辉榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大群众运动，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫祖国国防的伟大斗争中立新功。
    大会主席台正中，悬挂着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。毛主席给海军的题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”林副主席为海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的题词：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”在会场四周闪闪发光。
    大会在“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆”的欢呼声和雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始。指战员们一遍又一遍地齐声朗读毛主席语录：“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”、“要斗私，批修”、“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”。参加祝捷大会的，有海军负责人王宏坤、广州部队负责人杨梅生，以及南海舰队、东海舰队、海军航空兵的负责人周志先、高志荣等和陆、海、空三军指战员一千多人。
    王宏坤在会上代表中央军委宣读了嘉奖令，并向作战有功人员颁发了革命宝书《毛主席语录》、《毛主席诗词》和金光闪闪的毛主席像章。
    王宏坤在大会上讲了话。他首先代表海军党委和海军领导机关向这次参战部队全体指战员表示热烈祝贺。他指出，这次空战的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的重大成果，是参战部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席最新指示的重大成果。这次空战胜利的最大特点是：参战部队全体指战员带着无限忠于毛主席的红心，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指挥战斗。这一事实再次证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢，不怕死，无往而不胜。
    王宏坤在讲话中勉励部队指战员，要进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，作学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，坚决贯彻执行支左不支派的方针，作好“三支”“两军”和拥军爱民工作，更好地担负起保卫祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣任务。
    王宏坤最后指出，美帝国主义遭到打击之后，是决不会死心的，必然还要对我国进行战争挑衅，甚至进行新的军事冒险。我们必须戒骄戒躁，提高警惕，加强战备，再接再厉，随时准备消灭来犯之敌，争取更大胜利。
    杨梅生接着在会上讲话，他指出，最近，美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南的败局，正在加紧勾结苏修叛徒集团和各国反动派，加紧策划扩大侵越战争，企图把战火烧到整个印度支那和东南亚。美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国领土台湾。我们必须提高革命警惕性，切实作好战备工作。如果敌人敢于挺而走险，把战争强加在我们头上，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭它。
    在这次空战中荣立一等功的副大队长陈武录代表作战有功人员在会上讲话。他坚决表示，要更加坚定不移地以林副主席为光辉榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵照毛主席关于抓革命，促战备的伟大教导，百倍提高警惕，加强战备，在保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民立新功。
    大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
