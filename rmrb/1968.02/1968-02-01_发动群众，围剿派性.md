The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xingou Commune, with the assistance of the propaganda team of a local military unit that studies Chairman Mao's thoughts, held a major debate to root out factionalism. This debate was well-conducted! It vividly exposed the crimes of factionalism, identified the root causes of factionalism, and pointed out the fundamental way to defeat factionalism with Mao Zedong Thought.

Through this debate, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xingou Commune, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, clearly recognized: "Among a thousand contradictions, ten thousand contradictions, the greatest contradiction is with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; this conflict of interests, that conflict of interests, the fundamental conflict of interests is between the socialist road and the capitalist road; you say you are right, I say I am right, if we do not criticize and repudiate revisionism and overthrow factionalism, we will not be in line with the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have such clear distinctions between love and hate, and such broad minds!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To turn verbal Marxism into practical Marxism in real life, there will be no sectarianism." The reason why some of our comrades cannot firmly struggle against the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie is that they have not, like the awakened workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with deep proletarian feelings, and have not turned verbal Marxism into practical Marxism in their own real lives. Once we turn Mao Zedong Thought into our actions, then our horizons will be unprecedentedly broad, the boundaries between enemies and us will be crystal clear, comrades will be closely united, and factionalism will be quickly eliminated.

Reactionary bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is like a plague. Once the masses are truly mobilized, it will have nowhere to hide.

    发动群众，围剿派性
    新沟公社的广大贫农下中农，在当地驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，进行了一场围剿派性的大辩论。这场辩论搞得好！它生动地揭露了派性的罪行，找到了产生派性的根源，指出了用毛泽东思想打倒派性的根本途径。
    新沟公社的贫农下中农学习了毛主席的最新指示，通过这场辩论，明确地认识到：“一千个矛盾，一万个矛盾，同党内一小撮走资派是最大的矛盾；这个利害冲突，那个利害冲突，社会主义道路和资本主义道路才是最根本的利害冲突；你说你有理，我说我有理，不斗私批修，不打倒派性，就不合毛泽东思想的大道理。”广大贫农下中农爱憎多么分明，胸怀多么开阔！
    毛主席教导我们：“把口头上的马克思主义变成为实际生活里的马克思主义，就不会有宗派主义了。”我们某些同志其所以不能坚定地和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作斗争，就是因为他们没有象觉悟的工人和贫农下中农那样，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情活学活用毛主席的最新指示，还没有把口头上的马克思主义变为自己实际生活里的马克思主义。一旦我们把毛泽东思想化为自己的行动，那么我们的眼界就会空前开阔，敌我界限就会泾渭分明，同志之间就会紧密团结，派性就会迅速消除。
    反动的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性正象瘟神一样，群众真正发动起来了，它就无处藏身了。
