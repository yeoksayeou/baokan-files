Some places have also held celebration rallies and parades. The telegram from the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee stated that the birth of the Guangdong Province Revolutionary Committee marks a decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong Province, which is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The joyous news of the birth of the Guangdong Province Revolutionary Committee has greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia, Zhejiang, and other places. Proletarian revolutionaries in Jilin Province and Changchun City said that the current biggest enemy of achieving revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination is bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to wage a "people's war" against factionalism, to consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, to promote the three-in-one combination, and to contribute all our efforts to the early establishment of the Jilin Province and Changchun City Revolutionary Committees. Some representatives participating in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Workers' Congress in Yinchuan excitedly said that we Ningxia revolutionary workers must learn from the working class of Guangdong, carry forward the revolutionary fine traditions of the working class, and vow to be models in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and in promoting production while carrying out the revolution, to make every effort to establish the autonomous region's revolutionary committee as soon as possible.

Proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in the Xi'an region have expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with great eagerness, to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions with great enthusiasm, to execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly, and to defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions with loyalty.

Neighboring provinces such as Guangxi, as well as Yunnan, Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, have enthusiastically celebrated the birth of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Revolutionary Committees. They pointed out that this has great significance for consolidating our national defense, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, developing our socialist cause, supporting the patriotic struggle of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon against British aggression, and supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Revolutionary workers in Hohhot said that Guangdong and Inner Mongolia, one being the southern gateway of the motherland and the other being the anti-revisionist frontline in the north, have both achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought. While celebrating our victories, we must never forget class struggle, maintain high revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely smash all sabotage plots by domestic and foreign class enemies, turning our border into an impregnable fortress.

The joyous news of the birth of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Revolutionary Committees has been met with great joy by the troops of the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers of the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" immediately gathered around Chairman Mao's portrait after listening to the broadcast and seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" written in Guangzhou more than forty years ago. They said: We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for the revolution," use the keen Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish between enemies and friends, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the 40 million heroic people of Guangdong Province are filled with great excitement and enthusiastically celebrate the simultaneous birth of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Revolutionary Committees amidst the stormy class struggle. The revolutionary people of the entire province have resolutely expressed their determination to strictly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, to redouble their efforts, to strive for the best, to continue their efforts, and to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, allowing the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to forever fly high at the southern gateway of the motherland!

In recent days, from the Nanling Mountains to the Wuzhishan Mountains, from the Chaozhou Plain to the Pearl River Delta, the cities and countryside of Guangdong Province have been filled with the sound of drums and the waving of red flags, creating a festive atmosphere. The revolutionary masses have shouted in unison: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary youths have unanimously expressed their determination to further expand and deepen the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, to deepen the revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly repudiate and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced person Ertao Zhong and his agent Zhao Ziyang in Guangdong Province, to eliminate their poisonous influence, to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, and to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses have enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangdong Province during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at various celebration rallies.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangdong Province have expressed their joy and enthusiastically celebrated the birth of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Revolutionary Committees.

The soldiers have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching: "The rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." They pointed out: Guangdong Province is the southern gateway of our great socialist motherland, located on the frontline of national defense, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, and the class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. We must never forget class struggle, resolutely defend the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committee, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our defense, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, be prepared at any time to smash the war provocations of American imperialism and its running dogs, resolutely strike against all sabotage plots by domestic and foreign class enemies, and defend the newly born revolutionary committee with struggle.
