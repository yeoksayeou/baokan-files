The east wind raises thousands of waves, and the ten-thousand-li Yangtze River is bustling with navigation. On the docks and ships of the Yangtze River, revolutionary slogans are everywhere, and red flags flutter in the wind. Fleets of tugboats pushing ships and sailing wooden boats are loaded with agricultural machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and draft cattle, continuously heading towards rural people's communes to support spring farming. Fleets of ships loaded with ore, coal, and sand are rushing towards the Wuhan Steel Company. Last winter, with the great harvest in agriculture and the need to develop industrial production, the transportation tasks on the Yangtze River increased significantly. In the first half of January this year, the transportation volume has shown a significant increase compared to December last year.

    东风卷起千重浪，万里长江航运忙。在长江的码头上、轮船上，革命标语如林，风展红旗如画。一队队拖轮顶推的船队和扬帆的木船，满载农业机械、化肥、农药、种子、耕牛等源源运往农村人民公社，支援春耕生产。一队队轮船满载着矿石、煤炭和砂石，争向武汉钢铁公司驰行。去年冬季，随着农业大丰收和发展工业生产的需要，长江运输任务增长很大。今年一月上中旬的运输量又比去年十二月份有了显著增加。
