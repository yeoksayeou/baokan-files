	U.S. Spy Ship's Deputy Captain and Operations Officer Admit to Conducting Spy Activities Against Korea on Direct Orders from the Johnson Administration

	Peking, Feb. 9 (New China News Agency) — Pyongyang: Following the publication by the Korean Central News Agency of the confession of Lloyd M. Bucher, captain of the U.S. armed spy ship Pueblo, the agency on Feb. 4 to 7 published the confessions of the deputy captain and navigator, Edward L. Murphy Jr., and the operations officer, Frederick C. Schuh Jr. They all admitted that the U.S. armed spy ship Pueblo had intruded into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to engage in military espionage, committing serious crimes.

	Edward L. Murphy Jr. admitted, “The Pueblo penetrated deeply into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to engage in espionage activities.”

	He said: “Our operating area was divided into three zones along the east coast of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These three zones included four coastal areas where we were to collect intelligence. The places are Chŏngjin, Chŏngjin, Majŏn Island, and Wŏnsan.”

	“Our entire ship's position recorded in the logbook clearly proves that we had deeply intruded into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.”

	He said: “Our deep intrusion into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was all recorded in the ship's logbook.”

	He said: “As a navigator, I can guarantee the accuracy of the entire route of the Pueblo's voyage after it deeply intruded into the territorial waters of Korea to engage in espionage activities against Korea.”

	He admitted: “Throughout our voyage in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we were engaged in espionage activities.”

	“I fully realize that my action of navigating a spy ship deep into Korean waters is an unforgivable serious crime. My aggressive and hostile actions were carried out on the direct orders of the Johnson administration and my superiors, and I have no other excuse for this behavior.”

	Frederick C. Schuh Jr. admitted: He was captured by the Korean People's Army Navy while engaging in military espionage activities deep in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea near Wonsan aboard the armed spy ship Pueblo.

	He admitted: “The Pueblo was originally an armed spy ship, and this ship has been performing genuine military espionage missions since it was commissioned.”

	“All the personnel on the Pueblo, like me, are professional spies who have been engaged in coastal espionage activities.”

	“According to the tasks assigned by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department of Defense in Washington, we arrived at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, on Dec. 1, 1967.”

	“There, we received a special mission from the U.S. naval commander in Japan, Frank Johnson. He personally came aboard and briefed us on the mission.”

	“Our mission was to reconnoiter various military facilities in the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, radar positions, port capacities, the number and tonnage of ships entering and leaving, and the mobility of the navy, especially various electronic waves from the Korean People's Army.”

	He admitted: “The crimes I committed against the government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are unforgivable.”

	“The crimes committed by me and my ship were carried out under the approval of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington and the personal command of the U.S. naval commander in Japan.”

	“The intelligence I collected was used to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This is the most serious crime and act of aggression.”

	The crew members Danny R. Tucker and Robert J. Hammond also admitted that the military espionage activities conducted by this ship were a great crime against the Korean people.

	The U.S. armed spy ship Pueblo was captured by the Korean People's Army Navy forces in Korean territorial waters on Jan. 23.

    美国间谍船进行侵略活动铁证如山
    美间谍船副船长和作战官供认对朝鲜的间谍活动是根据约翰逊政府直接命令干的
    新华社九日讯　平壤消息：朝鲜中央通讯社继公布了美国武装间谍船 “普韦布洛号”船长劳埃德·马克·布克的供词后，又于二月四日至七日连续公布了副船长兼领航员爱德华·伦兹·小默菲和作战官弗雷德里克·卡尔·小舒马赫等人的供词。他们一致供认，美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”侵入了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海水域进行军事间谍活动，犯下严重罪行。
    爱德华·伦兹·小默菲供认，“普韦布洛号”深深地侵入了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海水域，进行了间谍活动。
    他供认：“我们行动水域分成三个区域，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国东海岸一带。这三个区域有我们要对之收集情报的四个沿海地方。”“这些地方是清津、城津、马养岛和元山。”
      “航海日记上记载的整个船的方位清楚证明，我们深深侵入了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的沿海水域。”
    他说：“我们之深深侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海水域，都记录在船上的方位日记中。”
    他说：作为一个领航员，我可以保证“普韦布洛号”在深深侵入朝鲜的沿海水域后，进行反对朝鲜的间谍活动的整个航行路线的准确性。
    他供认：“我们在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海水域中的整个航行中，都在进行谍报活动。”
      “我完全认识到，我自己导航一艘间谍船深入朝鲜水域的行动是完全不能容忍的严重罪行。我的侵略性敌对行动是根据约翰逊政府和我的上级直接命令干的，除此以外，我无法为这种行为辩解。”
    弗雷德里克·卡尔·小舒马赫供认：他是在深深侵入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海水域进行军事间谍活动时在元山附近被朝鲜人民军海军俘获的武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”上的作战官。
    他供认：“‘普韦布洛号’原来就是一艘武装间谍船，这艘船从服役至今一直执行着地地道道的军事间谍任务。”
    “‘普韦布洛号’上的全部人员象我一样都是一直从事沿海间谍活动的间谍专业人员。”
      “按照华盛顿的美国陆海空军参谋长联席会议和国防部所规定的任务，我们在一九六七年十二月一日到达日本横须贺的海军基地。”
    “在那里，我们从美国驻日本海军司令弗兰克·约翰逊那里接受了特殊任务。他亲自到船上，给我们交代了任务。”
    “我们的任务是侦察朝鲜民主主义人民共和国沿海水域的各种军事设施，雷达位置，港口容纳能力，进出船只数目及其载重量以及海军的机动性，特别是来自朝鲜人民军军方的各种电子波。”
    他供认：“我对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民所犯的罪行是永远不能原谅的。”
    “我和我的船所犯的罪行是在华盛顿的美国陆海空军参谋长联席会议赞同下、美国驻日本的海军司令亲自指挥下进行的。”
    “我所收集的情报是用来攻击朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的。这是最严重的罪行和侵略行动。”
    “普韦布洛号”上的船员小邓尼·罗·塔克和无线电截听员罗伯特·詹姆斯·哈蒙德也都供认这条船进行的军事间谍活动，是对朝鲜人民犯下了极大的罪行。
    美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”是在一月二十三日被朝鲜人民军海军部队在朝鲜领海内俘获的。
