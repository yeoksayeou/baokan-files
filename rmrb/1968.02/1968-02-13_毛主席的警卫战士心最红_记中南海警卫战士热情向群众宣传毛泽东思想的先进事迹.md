During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the nation, with profound class feelings of limitless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards the great teacher Chairman Mao, came from all corners of the country to the side of the beloved Chairman Mao. They sang and danced, praising the reddest sun in their hearts with countless songs; they beat drums and gongs, reporting the joyous news of victory to the great leader Chairman Mao; they gazed at the bright lights of Zhongnanhai, determined to spread the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the five lakes and four seas; they held high the red books, forever advancing along the revolutionary course guided by Chairman Mao.

Revolutionary people cherished the unforgettable moments spent by the red sun. Countless young revolutionaries, with excited hearts, studied Chairman Mao's works word by word by his side, saying, "Studying the teachings of Chairman Mao for one day by his side is an unforgettable experience for life." Countless revolutionary comrades, with limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao, requested to stand guard with the guardsmen in Zhongnanhai; countless revolutionary masses, holding a handful of soil, a jug of water, or a leaf from the hands of the guardsmen, shed tears of happiness. A worker from a seed breeding farm wrapped a handful of soil from Zhongnanhai in a new handkerchief, saying, "I will use this soil to breed the best seeds, spread them across the nation, and let the 700 million people know that these are seeds bred with the soil from Chairman Mao's side." A border guard from the Karakoram Mountains, receiving a jug of water from Zhongnanhai filled by the guardsmen, said, "I will take this jug of water back to the border, so that my comrades can grow healthy under the dew of Chairman Mao." An overseas Chinese youth, returning home after completing her studies, was instructed by her mother in a letter to express the family's wish for Chairman Mao's longevity and to bring back a handful of soil and a pine branch from Chairman Mao's side as a lasting memento.

These moving scenes constantly inspired and educated the guardsmen of Zhongnanhai. They were determined to turn their honorable posts into battlefields for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, spreading the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to all directions, and inspiring hundreds of millions of people to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

With the utmost enthusiasm and utmost responsibility, the guardsmen propagated Mao Zedong Thought. They actively did the work of the masses who came to them, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses, promptly conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses, seriously answering various questions raised by the revolutionary masses, and patiently and meticulously doing ideological and political work.

Propagating Mao Zedong Thought enthusiastically is the greatest help and strongest support for the revolutionary masses. Once, a cadre from a production team came from a certain place. During the Four Cleanups movement, he fought against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. The fallen capitalist roaders within the Party, in collusion with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, under the banner of "rebellion," persecuted revolutionary cadres, attempting to reverse the verdict. This cadre from the production team was persecuted and his spirits were somewhat dampened. The guardsmen believed that what he needed most was Mao Zedong Thought, so they used Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage him and boost his fighting spirit. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings with him: "Our comrades must see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, raise our courage." They also gave him some relevant documents to post. This cadre from the production team excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" He tightly grasped the guardsman's hand, saying, "With Chairman Mao's support and the Party's policies guiding me, I will return and unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, fight together, and struggle to the end with the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society! Thank you for your encouragement."

The guardsmen enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to tens of thousands of revolutionary masses, giving them inspiration and strength. Although their contact with the masses was brief, the guardsmen were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm of "utmost responsibility," not wasting a single second, actively and proactively sending Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the revolutionary masses.

One day, a knowledge youth who went to the countryside to support agriculture wanted to find a job in the city, reasoning that "I have worked in the countryside for three years, and the state should consider my personal interests." The masses used the living facts of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to help him. The youth's thoughts were not clear, so he argued with everyone. The guardsmen felt that they should use Mao Zedong Thought to enlighten and help him raise his consciousness, untie the knots in his mind, so they took the initiative to lead the youth aside and have a heart-to-heart talk. The guardsman studied with him Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and Chairman Mao's teachings on intellectual youth's necessity to integrate with the workers and peasants, criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by China's Khrushchev, such as the theory of "merging public and private interests." This made the youth realize that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches people's souls, and the struggle between public and private interests is a struggle between two worldviews. Patient help and sincere conversation made the youth convinced. He said, "I indeed fell for China's Khrushchev's tricks, only thinking of 'me,' forgetting the state's interests. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, work in the countryside for a lifetime, reform my worldview for a lifetime, and strive to be 'a person of high moral character, a person of purity, a person of virtue, a person free from lowly interests, a person beneficial to the people.'"

The guardsmen, day and night, seized every opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses. If one person came, they talked with one person; if a group came, they went among the masses to speak.

One night, a mass organization reported a situation to the relevant departments. While passing by Zhongnanhai and temporarily stopping, the guardsmen, from a brief conversation and their large slogans, understood that they had significant antagonism towards another mass organization. The guardsmen thought that the focus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was to criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, which was the revolutionary direction. They should help the revolutionary masses grasp this revolutionary direction. The guardsmen seized every second, before they left, studied with them Chairman Mao's teachings on "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution, and also the primary question of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," making them realize that they should use class standpoint to view the differences between the two revolutionary mass organizations, never to fall for the tricks of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and bad elements, diverting the direction of the struggle, and doing things that make friends sad and enemies happy. After doing ideological and political work, this mass organization finally eased the antagonism towards another mass organization. A responsible person from this mass organization said to the guardsman, "Comrade, rest assured, we will firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, unite the broad masses, think with one heart, and strive with one mind, and will not let any trick of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party succeed." They shouted slogans of "Defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death" and "Down with China's Khrushchev," waving goodbye to the guardsmen.

The guardsmen encountered tens of thousands of masses, faced thousands of things, and encountered thousands of problems. They often analyzed the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, according to different objects, different situations, different regions, and different problems, familiarized themselves with characteristics, grasped laws, and summarized dozens of "how to do" in practice. Each problem was answered with Chairman Mao's quotations. Thus, in their brief contact with the masses, they could more quickly and accurately grasp the masses' thoughts, identify and judge different types of problems, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a targeted manner.

A mass organization reported to the guardsmen their situation of fighting "internal wars" with another mass organization, completely blaming the other side. The guardsmen believed that the root cause of their fighting "internal wars" and not being able to unite for a long time was being instigated by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism was at play. The guardsmen, targeting this problem, repeatedly studied with them Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." They explained that a unit splitting into two factions, opposing each other, was mainly because the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, to save themselves, deceived the masses, instigated the masses to fight the masses, reminding them to be vigilant and not to fall for the tricks of the bad elements. Some comrades in this mass organization believed that they should firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions but also blamed the other side too much. At this time, the guardsmen emphasized Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "the two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak about their own shortcomings and errors, each doing more self-criticism, seeking great unity and storing small differences," hoping they could overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and achieve great unity under revolutionary principles. They immediately expressed that they would definitely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with actual actions. Soon, the newspaper reported the good news that the mass organizations in this region, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieved great unity. The guardsmen happily said, "Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the most powerful, wherever they are implemented, victory is achieved."

When propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the guardsmen also fully used the mass line method, mobilizing the masses to educate themselves. Sometimes, they asked the Red Guards to use their personal experiences of being persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line to arouse the revolutionary masses' hatred towards the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line; sometimes, they asked revolutionary old cadres who had participated in the revolutionary wars to use their revolutionary spirit of following Chairman Mao to fight bravely and fearlessly sacrifice, encouraging the revolutionary masses to fight resolutely against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party; sometimes, they asked old workers to recall their miserable lives in the old society, criticizing China's Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism, attempting to make the working people suffer twice, raising the class consciousness of young workers, returning to their units, and making revolution on the spot. An apprentice, instigated by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, demanded to solve the problem of regularization and wages. The guardsmen, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "class struggle, once grasped, it works," targeted the apprentice's active thoughts, asking the old worker present to recall bitterness and sweetness. The guardsmen also calculated a few accounts politically and economically: if workers leave the factory, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party escape the struggle, the more workers come out, the happier the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party; production is delayed, the state suffers losses, the longer the time outside, the greater the state's losses; if one falls for the tricks of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, only seeking a little material benefit, one's thoughts will be corrupted. This method of calculation, young workers could easily understand and accept, the more they calculated, the clearer their minds, the brighter their eyes. Living facts exposed the evil plot of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, attempting to use counter-revolutionary economism to disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The young worker excitedly said, "This lesson is well taught, my mind is clear now." He expressed that he would immediately return to fight against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, grasp revolution, promote production, and achieve double victories in revolution and production!

The guardsmen enthusiastically served the masses, doing as Chairman Mao said. They did tens of thousands of good deeds for the masses, using actual actions to spread Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses. The people saw the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought from the guardsmen's words and deeds, felt the warmth of Mao Zedong Thought, and were educated by Mao Zedong Thought. The guardsmen said, "Doing good deeds for the masses as Chairman Mao taught will make the broad masses love Chairman Mao more, love Mao Zedong Thought more, love Chairman Mao's revolutionary line more, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better."

Chairman Mao taught us, "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people's interests." Chairman Mao's words are the highest instructions, the highest standard of action.

One cold winter night, a woman from Ningxia came with two children, wanting to go to a reception station to report a situation, but after a day of searching, she still hadn't found it, and her mood was very anxious. A guardsman who had just finished his shift, enthusiastically took the woman's package, helped her carry the children, and together went to find the reception station. However, the guardsman didn't know the exact address of the reception station. They turned several alleys, asked several offices, but still couldn't find it. It was late at night, where to ask? The guardsman remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely," "thoroughly," and two "extremes," determined to find it. He searched for over three hours before finally finding it. The woman, with tears of excitement, said, "You are truly worthy of being the good guardsmen by Chairman Mao's side."

An old woman from Henan came to Beijing to visit her son, but she lost her son's letter and anxiously came to the gate of Zhongnanhai, asking the guardsmen by Chairman Mao's side to help her find her son. But she only knew her son's name and that he was a film projectionist. Beijing is so big, and there are so many projectionists, where to find him? The guardsmen, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "caring for the people's joys and sorrows" and "in the world, the most feared thing is 'seriousness,' the Communist Party is the most serious," invited the old woman into the rest room, poured her a cup of water, and comforted her not to worry. Then, they made phone calls everywhere. Shift after shift, unit after unit, they inquired. After over eight hours, they finally found her son in a certain unit of the PLA. The old woman was very excited, saying, "Seeing you is like seeing the Eighth Route Army of old."

The guardsmen, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "selflessly serving others," did everything possible to do good deeds for the masses, making the masses feel the warmth and happiness by Chairman Mao's side. When receiving visiting masses, in the scorching summer, they sent cup after cup of hot water to the masses' hands; in the heavy rain, they endured being soaked, putting raincoats on the masses' bodies; in the cold winter, they endured the cold, putting cotton coats on the masses' bodies; they guided the revolutionary masses of ethnic minorities and the deaf-mute; they sent off the Red Guards who came from far away to Beijing, giving them haircuts, repairing shoes, treating illnesses, and mending clothes. A worker passing by Zhongnanhai, receiving a cup of water from the guardsman, excitedly said, "This is not ordinary water, this is the water from Chairman Mao's side, it is his old man's greatest concern and support for us proletarian revolutionaries. We proletarians must follow Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

The guardsmen did good deeds for the masses meticulously, no matter how small the deed, they did it well. One noon, several workers from outside came, wanting to report a problem to the relevant departments. A guardsman gave the wrong address. When this guardsman was about to go off duty to eat, he realized the problem. However, the workers had already walked far away. This guardsman thought of Chairman Mao's teachings of "utmost responsibility for work, utmost enthusiasm for comrades and the people," immediately chased after them, searched for over half an hour before finding them. The workers, seeing the guardsman so responsible and serious, were very moved. They excitedly said, "The water from Chairman Mao's side is the sweetest, the guardsmen of Chairman Mao have the reddest hearts."

The guardsmen would never forget:

The great leader Chairman Mao personally attended the funeral of the guardsman Zhang Zide, calling on all military and civilian personnel to learn from Zhang Zide, serving the people wholeheartedly.

The great leader Chairman Mao repeatedly taught the guardsmen to humbly learn from the masses, forever being the masses' students.

The great leader Chairman Mao instructed the guardsmen to study culture, wanting them to be revolutionary fighters who can both write and fight, serving the people better.

The great leader Chairman Mao paid great attention to the guardsmen actively participating in labor exercises, wanting them not to forget their roots, forever preserving the character of the working people.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally instructed the guardsmen to go to the mass movements, experience wind and rain, see the world, wanting them to temper themselves into successors who are forever loyal to the people and the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The guardsmen saw with their own eyes and heard with their own ears:

The revolutionary people of Jinggangshan sent Chairman Mao a pair of straw shoes, expressing their firm resolve to advance along the revolutionary course guided by Chairman Mao. They reminded the guardsmen to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao to revolution to the end.

The revolutionary people of Shaanbei used golden grains of rice to inlay the seven big characters of "Chairman Mao lives forever," expressing their firm resolve to follow Chairman Mao to revolution to the end. They reminded the guardsmen to fight for Mao Zedong Thought for life.

The revolutionary people of the old revolutionary base in Shandong sent Chairman Mao a shoulder pole used in the war years, expressing their grand ambition to carry the heavy burden of world revolution following Chairman Mao. They reminded the guardsmen, "You are representing all of China and all revolutionary people of the world to stand guard, do not disappoint this great entrustment, this is the greatest wish and fundamental interest of all revolutionary people of the world."

The great teacher Chairman Mao's affectionate care and repeated instructions; the revolutionary people's ardent expectations and heavy entrustment are forever engraved in the guardsmen's hearts.

They declared to the great commander and the people of the nation: For life, they will study and apply Chairman Mao's works, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and dedicate their lives for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death, advancing forever and achieving victory forever in the face of the storms of class struggle!

    毛主席的警卫战士心最红
    ——记中南海警卫战士热情向群众宣传毛泽东思想的先进事迹
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，全国亿万革命人民怀着对伟大导师毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，从祖国四面八方来到敬爱的毛主席身边。他们载歌载舞，千歌万曲赞颂心中最红最红的红太阳；他们敲锣打鼓，向伟大领袖毛主席报告胜利的喜讯；他们仰望着中南海明亮的灯光，决心把战无不胜的毛泽东思想传播到五湖四海；他们高举红彤彤的宝书，永远沿着毛主席指引的革命航道前进。
    革命人民非常珍视在红太阳身边度过的难忘时刻。无数革命小将怀着激动的心情，在毛主席身边一字一句地学习毛主席著作，他们说：“在毛主席身边学习一天他老人家的教导，永生难忘。”无数革命派的战友怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，要求和警卫战士在中南海并肩站一班岗；无数革命群众捧着从警卫战士手中要来的中南海的一把土、一壶水、一片树叶，幸福地流下了热泪。一位良种培植场的工人用新手绢包上中南海的一把土，他说：“我要用这把土培植出最好最好的种子，传播全国，让七亿人民都知道这是用毛主席身边的土培育出来的。”一位从喀喇昆仑山上来的边防战士，接过警卫战士给他装满的一壶中南海的水，他说：“我要把这壶水带回边疆，好让同志们在毛主席的雨露下健康成长。”一位旅居国外的华侨女青年，回国学习期满将要离开祖国时，她妈妈来信再三嘱咐她代表全家祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！回来的时候一定要带回毛主席身边的一把土，一根松枝，作为永远的纪念。
    这些激动人心的情景，时刻鼓舞和教育着中南海的警卫战士。他们决心把自己的光荣岗位，变成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想传播四面八方，鼓舞亿万人民去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    以极端热忱、极端负责任的精神，宣传毛泽东思想
    警卫战士以“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的精神，自觉地做好送上门来的群众工作。他们热情地向革命群众宣传毛泽东思想，及时地向革命群众传达毛主席的最新指示，认真地回答革命群众提出的各种各样的问题，耐心细致地进行思想政治工作。
    热情地宣传毛泽东思想，就是对革命群众最大的帮助，最有力的支持。一次，从某地来了一位生产队的干部，因为在四清运动中，他向党内一小撮走资派进行了斗争，四清下台的党内走资派勾结地富反坏分子，打着“造反”的旗号，对革命干部进行打击报复，妄图翻案。这个生产队干部遭到迫害，情绪有些低沉。警卫战士认为他最需要的是毛泽东思想，就用毛主席的教导去鼓励他，提高他的斗争勇气。于是，和他一起学习毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”还送给他一些有关张贴文件。这个生产队干部激动地高呼“毛主席万岁！”他紧紧地握着战士的手说：“有毛主席他老人家给我撑腰，有党的政策给我引路，我回去一定和贫下中农团结在一起，战斗在一起，同党内一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神斗争到底！感谢同志们给我的鼓励。”
    警卫战士就是这样满腔热情地向成千上万的革命群众宣传毛泽东思想，给了广大革命群众以鼓舞和力量。他们和群众的接触虽然是短促的，但是，战士们充满了“极端的负责任”的革命热忱，不放过一分一秒，积极主动地把毛泽东思想送到革命群众的心坎上。
    有一天，一个下乡支援农业的知识青年，要到城市找工作，理由是：“在农村已经干了三年，国家应当照顾个人利益。”群众运用文化大革命中活生生的事实，对他进行帮助。青年人思想不通，就和大家辩论起来。警卫战士觉得应该用毛泽东思想去启发和帮助他提高觉悟，解开思想上的疙瘩，就主动地把青年领到旁边和他谈心。战士同他一起学习毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于知识青年必须同工农群众相结合的教导，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的“公私溶化”论等反革命修正主义谬论。使这个青年认识到，无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，公与私的斗争就是两种世界观的斗争。耐心的帮助，诚恳的交谈，使这个青年口服心服。他说：我确实上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，光为“我”字，忘记了国家利益。我坚决听毛主席的话，在农村干一辈子革命，改造一辈子世界观，争取做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。
    警卫战士不分昼夜，不失时机，只要和群众接触，就热情地向群众宣传毛泽东思想。一个人来，就和一个人谈；成群结队的来，就分头到群众中去讲。
    有一天夜里，一个群众组织向有关部门反映情况，在路过中南海暂时停留的时候，警卫战士从简短的谈话中和他们刷的大标语上，了解到他们同另一个群众组织有很大的对立情绪。战士们想，无产阶级文化大革命运动，重点是整党内一小撮走资派，这是革命的大方向，应当帮助革命群众掌握这个大方向。战士们抓住分秒时间，在他们离开之前，同他们一起学习毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题”的教导，使他们认识到，要用阶级观点来看待两派革命群众的分歧，万万不能上党内一小撮走资派和坏人的当，转移斗争大方向，把矛头指向自己的同志，做出使亲者痛、仇者快的事情。经过做思想政治工作，这个群众组织终于缓和了同另一个群众组织的对立情绪。这个群众组织的一个负责人对战士说：“同志放心吧，我们一定牢牢掌握斗争大方向，团结广大群众，心往一处想，劲往一处使，决不让党内一小撮走资派的任何阴谋得逞。”他们高呼“誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线”、“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫”的口号，向战士们挥手告别。
    抓好活思想，把毛主席的最新指示送到群众的心坎上
    警卫战士接触的群众千千万万，遇到的事情千头万绪，碰到的问题千差万别。他们经常地分析无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，根据不同的对象，不同的情况，不同的地区，不同的问题，熟悉特点，掌握规律，在实践中总结了几十个“怎么办”。每一个问题都用毛主席语录回答。这样，他们在和群众的短促接触中，就比较快、比较准确地掌握群众的思想，识别和判断不同性质的问题，有针对性地宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的最新指示。
    有一个群众组织向警卫战士反映了他们同另一个群众组织打“内战”的情况，把责任完全归咎于对方。战士们认为他们打“内战”，长期联合不起来的根本原因是受党内一小撮走资派的挑动，是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作怪。战士们针对这个问题和他们反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”说明一个单位分成两大派，互相对立，主要是党内一小撮走资派为了保自己，蒙蔽群众，挑动群众斗群众，提醒他们提高警惕，不要上坏人的当。这个群众组织的一些同志认为应当坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，但是又过多地指责对方。这时，警卫战士又大讲毛主席关于“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的最新指示，希望他们克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。他们当场表示，一定要以实际行动落实毛主席的最新指示。不久，报上刊登了这个地区的群众组织在毛主席的最新指示的指引下，实现了革命大联合的好消息。战士们高兴地说：“毛主席的最新指示威力最大，哪里落实，哪里就取得胜利。”
    警卫战士在宣传毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示时，还充分运用群众路线的方法，发动群众自己教育自己。有时，他们请红卫兵小将用亲身遭受资产阶级反动路线迫害的活生生事实，激发革命群众对党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动路线的仇恨；有时，就请过去参加过革命战争的革命老干部，用当年跟随毛主席闹革命，英勇奋战，不怕牺牲的革命精神，鼓励革命群众同党内一小撮走资派作坚决斗争；有时，请老工人回忆他在旧社会的悲惨生活，批判中国赫鲁晓夫阴谋复辟资本主义，妄图让劳动人民受二遍苦的滔天罪行，提高青年工人阶级觉悟，返回本单位，就地闹革命。有一个学徒工，受党内一小撮走资派的挑动，要求解决转正和工资问题。警卫战士遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，针对学徒工的活思想，请当时在场的老工人忆苦思甜。战士们还从政治上、经济上算了几笔账：工人离开工厂，党内一小撮走资派逃避了斗争，工人出来的越多，党内一小撮走资派越高兴；误了生产，国家受损失，在外时间越长，国家损失越大；要是上了党内一小撮走资派的当，只图物质上得到一点利益，思想上就会受到腐蚀。这种算法，青年工人最容易领会，最容易接受，越算心越明，越比眼越亮。活生生的事实，揭穿了党内一小撮走资派妄图利用反革命经济主义扰乱毛主席的伟大战略部署的罪恶阴谋。青年工人激动地说：“这一课上得好，我的心透亮了。”他表示马上回去同党内一小撮走资派作斗争，抓革命，促生产，夺取革命、生产双胜利！
    用实际行动宣传毛泽东思想
    警卫战士满腔热情地为群众服务，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。他们为群众做了成千上万件好事，用实际行动向广大群众传播毛泽东思想。人民群众从警卫战士的一言一行中看到毛泽东思想的光辉，感受着毛泽东思想的温暖，受到毛泽东思想的教育。战士们说：“按毛主席的教导为群众做好事，就会使广大人民群众更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛泽东思想，更加热爱毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席的话就是最高指示，就是行动的最高准则。
    一个严冬的深夜，从宁夏来了一位妇女，带着两个孩子，要到一个接待站反映情况，转了一天还没有找到，心情非常急切。刚刚下哨的一个警卫战士，热情地接过这个妇女的包裹，帮她抱着孩子，一起去找接待站。可是战士不知道这个接待站的详细地址。他们转了几个胡同，询问了几个机关，还是没有找到。夜深人静，到哪里去问？这个战士想起了毛主席“完全”“彻底”和两个“极端”的教导，下定决心，一定要找到。他整整找了三个多小时，才找到了。这位妇女含着激动的眼泪说：“你们真不愧是毛主席身边的好战士。”
    有一位老大娘从河南来京看望儿子，因为把儿子的信件丢了，她焦急地来到中南海的大门口，请求毛主席身边的战士帮她找到儿子。但她除了名字，就只知道儿子是个电影放映员。北京这么大，放映员这么多，到哪里去找呢？警卫战士遵照毛主席要“关心群众的痛痒”，“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’”的教导，把老大娘请进休息室，倒了杯水，安慰她不要着急。然后通过电话四处联系。一班哨一班哨地往下交，一个单位一个单位地询问。经过八个多小时，终于在解放军某部找到了她的儿子。老大娘十分激动地说：“我看到你们，就象看到当年的八路军一样。”
    警卫战士遵照毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，千方百计为群众做好事，使人民群众感受到在毛主席身边的温暖和幸福。警卫战士在接待来访群众时，酷暑盛夏，把一碗一碗开水送到群众的手里；大雨滂沱，任凭自己挨淋，把雨衣披在群众的身上；风雪严冬，宁肯自己受冻，将棉大衣穿在群众身上；他们为兄弟民族和盲哑的革命群众带路送行；为远路来京的红卫兵革命小将理发、修鞋、看病、补衣服。一个工人路过中南海，从战士手中接过一碗水，激动地说：“这不是普通的水，这是毛主席身边的水，是他老人家对我们无产阶级革命派的最大关怀、最大支持。我们工人阶级要紧跟毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    警卫战士给群众办好事，一丝不苟，那怕一件小事也要办好。一天中午，从外地来了十几个工人，要向有关部门反映问题。一个战士把地址介绍错了。当这个战士下哨要去吃饭的时候，才发觉这个问题。但是工人早已走远了。这个战士想到毛主席“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的教导，立即追赶上去，找了半个多小时才找到。工人们见警卫战士这样负责认真，很受感动，他们激动地说：“毛主席身边的水最甜，毛主席的警卫战士心最红。”
    永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席
    警卫战士永远不会忘记：
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自参加了警卫战士张思德同志的追悼会，号召全体军民向张思德同志学习，全心全意地为人民服务。
    伟大领袖毛主席谆谆教导警卫战士要虚心向群众学习，永远做群众的小学生。
    伟大领袖毛主席指示警卫战士学文化，要他们做一个能文能武更好地为人民服务的革命战士。
    伟大领袖毛主席十分关心警卫战士积极参加劳动锻炼，要他们不要忘本，永远保持劳动人民的本色。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自指示警卫战士到群众运动中去经风雨，见世面，要他们锻炼成为永远忠于人民，忠于无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    警卫战士亲眼看到，亲耳听到：
