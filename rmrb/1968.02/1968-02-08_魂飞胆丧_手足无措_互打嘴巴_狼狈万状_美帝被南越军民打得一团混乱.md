In the face of the all-out offensive and continuous victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians, the American imperialist leaders are in a state of panic, flustered, and at odds with each other, fully exposing the American paper tiger's disarray.

Johnston, the key figure in the U.S. war against Vietnam, along with Secretary of State Rusk and outgoing Defense Secretary McNamara, gave a lengthy televised talk on February 4th regarding the recent developments in the South Vietnamese battlefield. They had to admit that the U.S. had no reliable intelligence on the South Vietnamese military's all-out offensive and did not know "when these attacks would occur or their specific targets." They even admitted they "did not know the plans to attack, for example, the U.S. Embassy or other institutions." These statements were a slap in the face to the White House. White House spokesman Christian, the day after the South Vietnamese military and civilians launched their all-out offensive, had tried to "stabilize morale" by falsely claiming that the U.S. had obtained intelligence on this matter.

The panicked Johnson, in his speech on February 2nd, had deceived himself and others by claiming that the South Vietnamese military's all-out attack had no military significance and had "completely failed." However, just two days later, Rusk and McNamara admitted dejectedly that the situation "was definitely not like that," and that the South Vietnamese military and civilians "continue to have the strength to carry out the kind of attacks we have seen in the past two or three days." The U.S. leaders' contradictory and self-contradictory statements perfectly illustrate the chaos into which American imperialism has been thrown by the South Vietnamese military's all-out offensive.

Meanwhile, American newspapers are lamenting the U.S.'s defeat. The New York Herald Tribune's editorial on February 5th complained that the U.S. and its military had suffered "unprecedented humiliation and danger." The paper pointed out that the U.S.'s bombing of North Vietnam had neither weakened the Vietnamese people's "fighting spirit" nor their "fighting capability." In another report, the paper noted that the developments of the past week had swept away the U.S. government's optimistic talk of "progress" in its "pacification" plans. The Chicago Sun-Times uneasily admitted that the South Vietnamese military's all-out offensive had not only created an urgent military crisis for the U.S. but also had serious political implications.

New China News Agency, February 4th: Under the combined attacks of the South Vietnamese military and civilians, urban and rural coordination, and internal and external coordination against the U.S. invaders, the American ruling clique is becoming increasingly chaotic. They are blaming and attacking each other due to the heavy defeat of the U.S.-puppet army on the South Vietnamese battlefield and are anxiously concerned that the People's Liberation Armed Forces will launch even greater offensives against the U.S.-puppet army.

The various lies spread by the U.S. leader Johnson in recent days about the situation in Vietnam have not only failed to achieve their goal of "stabilizing morale" but have instead been met with ridicule. Senator McCarthy of the Democratic Party in Minnesota criticized Johnson, saying that the developments in South Vietnam proved that the Johnson administration's reports of "progress" there were merely "self-deception."

McCarthy said that the South Vietnamese military and civilians' attacks on South Vietnamese cities proved that the U.S. had no control over South Vietnam and that their situation was worse than it was two years ago. He admitted that the South Vietnamese military and civilians were united, and the People's Liberation Armed Forces had obviously received strong support from the people. The Johnson administration's so-called "pacification" plan was a complete fraud.

Senator Mansfield acknowledged that the South Vietnamese military's fierce attacks on the U.S.-puppet army had created a "serious situation" for the U.S. He demanded that the U.S. government must reassess the U.S.'s military, political, and economic situation in South Vietnam. He also had to admit that the South Vietnamese military's all-out offensive showed the strength of the South Vietnamese people supporting the liberation forces. The People's Liberation Armed Forces were not "dwindling" as the U.S. propaganda claimed, but were "very active and powerful."

The chief of the U.S. military operations in Vietnam, Chayson, admitted that the U.S. forces in Vietnam were completely in a state of chaos, struggling to cope with the all-out attacks from the South. Chayson was deeply worried about the next move of the People's Liberation Armed Forces and expressed that the U.S. military might have to withdraw forces from the countryside to redeploy and defend the cities. The Associated Press reported on February 3rd that U.S. military leaders in South Vietnam were very uneasy about the South Vietnamese military's fierce offensive, fearing that "an even greater offensive might be coming."

    魂飞胆丧　手足无措　互打嘴巴　狼狈万状
    美帝被南越军民打得一团混乱
    据新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：在越南南方军民全面出击，节节胜利面前，美帝国主义的头目们魂飞胆丧，手足失措，互打嘴巴，充分暴露了美帝纸老虎的狼狈相。
    美帝头子约翰逊进行侵越战争的重要帮手国务卿腊斯克和即将下台的国防部长麦克纳马拉四日特地就最近南越战局的发展发表冗长的电视谈话。他们不得不承认，对于南越军民这次全面出击，美国事先并没有得到什么可靠的情报，并不知道这些进攻“将发生在那一天，也不知道具体的目标”，“确实并不知道计划对例如说美国大使馆或其他等一些机构发动进攻”。这些话无异打了白宫一个嘴巴。白宫发言人克里斯琴在南越军民发动这次全面出击后的第二天，为了“稳定人心”，曾经胡说什么美国事先就得到了有关这方面的情报。
    被南越军民的全面出击打得惊慌万状的约翰逊，在二日发表的谈话里曾经自欺欺人地宣传什么南越军民的这次全面攻击没有军事意义，已经“完全失败”。可是，事隔两天，腊斯克和麦克纳马拉沮丧地说，情况“肯定不是这样”，南越军民“继续拥有进行我们最近两三天看到的那样袭击的力量”，美国“面前有一些艰苦的战斗”。美帝头目这些互相矛盾、互打嘴巴的言论，绝妙地说明了美帝国主义在南越军民的全面出击下陷入的一片混乱。
    与此同时，美国报纸纷纷哀叹美帝的惨败。《纽约先驱论坛报》五日发表的社论抱怨说，美国和它的军队遭受了“空前的屈辱和危险”，美国对越南北方的轰炸“既未能削弱”越南人民的“战斗意志”，“也未能削弱其战斗能力”。这家报纸在另一篇报道中指出，过去一周的事态发展，使美国政府散布的“绥靖”计划取得“进展”等乐观论调一扫而空。《芝加哥太阳时报》不安地承认，南越军民的全面出击，不但对美国造成了迫切的军事危机，而且其政治含意也同样是严重的。
    新华社四日讯　在越南南方军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合向美国侵略军展开的猛烈攻击下，美国统治集团内部越来越混乱，他们由于美伪军队在南越战场上遭到惨败而互相埋怨、互相攻讦，并且忧心忡忡地担心人民解放武装力量将对美伪军队发动更大的攻势。
    美帝头子约翰逊连日来就越南局势散布的种种谎言，不仅未能达到其“稳定人心”的目的，反而受到一片嘲讽。明尼苏达州的民主党参议员麦卡锡指责约翰逊说，南越事态的发展证明，约翰逊政府关于在那里取得“进展”的报告不过是“自我欺骗的产物”。
    麦卡锡说，越南南方军民对南越城市的进攻，证明美国对南越“并没有任何控制，我们的处境比两年前更坏”。他承认，越南南方军民一致，人民解放武装力量显然得到人民的大力支持，约翰逊政府的所谓“绥靖”计划，完全是骗人的玩艺。
    参议员曼斯菲尔德承认，南越军民对美伪军队的猛烈攻击，已经给美国造成了“一个严重的局势”。他要求美国政府必须重新估计美国在南越的军事、政治和经济处境。他还不得不承认，南越军民的全面出击表明了支持解放武装的南越人民的力量，人民解放武装力量不是象美国宣传的那样在“消退”，“而是非常活跃有力”。
    侵越美军作战室主任蔡逊在一次谈话中承认，在南方军民的全面攻击下，侵越美军完全陷入了顾此失彼、难于招架的狼狈境地。蔡逊对人民解放武装力量的下一步行动忧心如焚，并且表示，美国军队为了守护他们的巢穴，“可能不得不从农村抽调力量来重新部署兵力以保卫城镇”。美联社三日报道说，在南越的美军头目对南越军民的猛烈出击十分不安，他们担心“一场甚至更大的攻势将会来临”。
