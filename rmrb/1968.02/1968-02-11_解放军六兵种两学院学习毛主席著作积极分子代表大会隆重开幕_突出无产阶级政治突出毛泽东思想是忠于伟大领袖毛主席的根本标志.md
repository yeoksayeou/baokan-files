The grand opening ceremony of the Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works from the six military branches and two academies was held in Beijing Workers' Stadium. The conference emphasized that highlighting proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental mark of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Representatives from the artillery, armored, engineering, railway, communications, chemical defense, and higher military and political academies, along with a wide range of soldiers, revolutionary workers, and family members, enthusiastically responded to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new level.

Xinhua News Agency, February 10th: Amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's comprehensive victory, and as the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought spreads more widely and deeply across the nation, nearly 10,000 representatives of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the People's Liberation Army's artillery, armored, engineering, railway, communications, chemical defense, higher military, and political academies gathered in Beijing Workers' Stadium on the afternoon of the 10th. With boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, they held a grand opening ceremony for the Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works.

Representatives from the frontiers, islands, plateaus, deserts, mountains, forests, and snowfields entered the venue, holding portraits of Chairman Mao and marching with vigorous steps. The representatives were filled with enthusiasm, singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, expressing their loyal hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The meeting began with the solemn song "The East Is Red." The representatives waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wished our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Attending today's meeting were military commission and various general departments, military branches, and Beijing military area leaders: Nie Rongzhen, Yang Chengwu, Wu Faxian, Ye Qing, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Xiuquan, Li Tianhuan, Liu Jinping, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Wen Yuceng, Zhang Chuming, Luo Xunchu, Liu Huaqing, Cai Shungli, Li Zuopeng, Wang Hongkun, Yu Lijin, Lu Yang, Jin Tao, Wu Lie, Chen Xiansui, Fu Chongbi, Huang Zuozhen, Liu Fu, Chen Renqi, Huang Zhiyong, Chen Shishan, Tan Furen, Luo Huasheng, Jiang Wen, Huang Wenming, Li Zhen, Liu Zhong, Song Weiqin.

Also attending were representatives from the six military branches and two academies' active learners of Chairman Mao's works, including "Iron-Boned Soldier" Zhang Chunyu of the Railway Corps, good soldier and steadfast-hearted cannon corps deputy political instructor Wang Kejing, brave armored corps soldier Shifu Tian who rescued a train in danger, representative from the 10th Company of an engineering corps unit who has struggled for 18 years in the snowy highlands, representative from a long-distance communication station of a red communications corps unit who ensured smooth communication during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and preventive chemical corps research fellow Ding Xiuzhen who resolutely took the path of integrating with workers and peasants.

Representatives from advanced collectives such as the former class of Lei Feng and the former class of Wang Jie, as well as comrade-in-arms and combat hero Zhao Shunyi of Dong Cunrui, were also invited to attend the meeting. The conference is a meeting to express loyalty to the great commander Chairman Mao; it is a meeting to summarize and exchange experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought; it is a meeting to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and vow to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Over the past year, the broad masses of soldiers, revolutionary workers, and family members from the six military branches and two academies, with deep feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, have taken Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example. They enthusiastically responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school. They resolutely implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to elevate the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. They carried forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, which emphasizes the integration of theory and practice. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they extensively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, creating an unprecedented new situation in the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of soldiers, revolutionary workers, and family members have never had such deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; the atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works has never been so thick; the awareness of line struggle has never been so high; the effect of breaking private interests and establishing public interests has never been so good; revolutionary enthusiasm has never been so great; and the growth of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause has never been so rapid.

The experience of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought by the broad masses of soldiers, revolutionary workers, and family members from the six military branches and two academies is concentrated in one point: unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Various levels of party committees have emphasized highlighting proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the fundamental mark of unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They say: Military work is complex and ever-changing, but the key is to grasp this fundamental point. They prioritize studying Chairman Mao's works and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in all their work. They discuss the situation by first emphasizing the excellent situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, assign tasks by first explaining how to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the tasks, and share experiences by first sharing the experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many organs, units, and academies have ensured that work time is tight, but the study of Chairman Mao's works is even tighter; engineering and technical requirements are high, but the requirements for studying Mao Zedong Thought are even higher. Under the leadership of various levels of party committees and leading cadres, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions has surged higher and higher.

The broad masses of soldiers, revolutionary workers, and family members from the six military branches and two academies have deeply felt in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao first requires cultivating a profound class feeling for the great leader Chairman Mao. They extensively discuss the history of world revolutionary struggles, praising Chairman Mao's great contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism; they extensively discuss the history of China's revolutionary struggles, praising the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; they extensively discuss the history of the liberation of the laboring people, praising the brilliant achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction under Chairman Mao's wise leadership; they extensively discuss the growth history of revolutionary heroes and their own progress under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, praising the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought and the remarkable achievements of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The more they discuss and praise, the deeper their feelings for Chairman Mao become.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it; the purpose of mastery is entirely for application." The broad masses of soldiers, revolutionary workers, and family members from the six military branches and two academies have deeply experienced in the struggle that whether one uses what they have learned from Chairman Mao's works and whether one implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the fundamental marks of loyalty to Chairman Mao, and the dividing line between complete revolutionaries and verbal revolutionaries. They say well: "Application is the sole purpose of studying Mao Zedong Thought; application is the fundamental way to master Mao Zedong Thought." The proletarian revolutionary factions of the direct organs of the six military branches and the two academies, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have taken Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their guide, dared to struggle, and were good at struggling. They vowed to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, showing their unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Soldiers fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, swiftly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The propaganda team of a communications corps unit traveled over 7,000 miles across mountains and rivers, conducting propaganda in three provinces and thirteen counties, quickly bringing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses. The military training teams of a railway corps unit in Shijingshan Middle School and an armored corps unit in the 18th Middle School have everything subordinated to the highest commander Chairman Mao's orders, resolutely implementing the principle of supporting the left without supporting the faction. They actively conducted ideological and political work, promoting the rapid realization of revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes in the two schools, establishing revolutionary committees, and vigorously carrying out the revolution. In a factory in Luoyang, where a new soldier from an artillery corps unit, Luo Xiangkuan, was on a support-left mission, he followed Chairman Mao's heart with unwavering loyalty. Wherever Chairman Mao pointed, he fought. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," he acted immediately, helping the revolutionary factions of two workshops to continuously hold nine sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary masses enthusiastically praised him as a good example of studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The broad masses of soldiers have resolutely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to severely criticize the bourgeois military line promoted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Liu Shaoqi and the anti-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan. A unit from the engineering corps, which has been evaluated as a four-good unit for seven consecutive years, has always adhered to Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the commander and the soul, extensively studying Chairman Mao's works and establishing Mao Zedong Thought. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they launched a thorough criticism of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, saying: "Class struggle is complex, but with a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao, one can see clearly and stand firmly."

The broad masses of soldiers, revolutionary workers, and family members from the six military branches and two academies have extensively held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, armed their minds with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois "self," and established the proletarian "public," greatly promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. They actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness." They linked their battle stations with the great cause of the Chinese revolution and world revolution. They worked diligently to safeguard Chairman Mao's construction, ensure the smooth communication of the proletarian headquarters, defend the motherland from invasion, and strive to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Today's opening ceremony was presided over by Political Commissar Chen Renqi of the Artillery Corps, representing the party committees of the six military branches and the proletarian revolutionary factions of the two academies, delivering the opening speech.

Representatives from the organs, units, and academies of active learners of Chairman Mao's works and advanced collectives spoke at the meeting.

The conference, amidst thunderous applause and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" unanimously adopted a letter of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

    雷锋生前所在班、王杰生前所在班等先进集体的代表，董存瑞生前的战友、战斗英雄郅顺义，被群众誉为焦裕禄式的好干部、炮兵某部政委俞纯也应邀出席大会。
    六兵种两学院学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，是向伟大统帅毛主席敬献忠心的大会；是总结、交流活学活用毛泽东思想经验的大会；是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署、全面落实毛主席最新指示、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的誓师大会。
    一年多来，六兵种两学院广大指战员和革命职工、家属，怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的深厚感情，以林副主席为光辉榜样，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召，坚决贯彻执行林副主席关于把活学活用毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段的指示，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，在无产阶级文化大革命中，大学大用毛泽东思想，大学大用毛主席一系列最新指示，使活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了一个空前未有的新局面。广大指战员和革命职工、家属，对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线的无产阶级感情从来没有象今天这样深；学习毛主席著作的空气从来没有象今天这样浓；路线斗争的觉悟从来没有象今天这样高；破私立公的效果从来没有象今天这样好；革命干劲从来没有象今天这样大；无产阶级革命事业接班人的成长从来没有象今天这样快。
    六兵种两学院广大指战员和革命职工、家属，活学活用毛泽东思想的经验，集中在一点，就是对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚。
    各级党委把突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想，落实毛主席的最新指示，作为无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的根本标志。他们说：部队工作千头万绪，情况千变万化，就是要抓这个根本。他们把学习毛主席著作和落实毛主席的最新指示，摆在一切工作的首位。他们讲形势首先讲活学活用毛主席著作的大好形势，交代任务首先交代如何用毛泽东思想去统帅任务，传播经验首先传播活学活用毛主席著作的经验。许多机关、部队和院校做到了工作时间要求紧，毛主席著作学习抓得更紧；工程、技术要求高，学习毛泽东思想要求更高。在各级党委和领导干部的带动下，活学活用毛主席著作，落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，一浪高过一浪。
    六兵种两学院的广大指战员和革命职工、家属，在无产阶级文化大革命中，深深体会到，无限忠于毛主席，首先要培养对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情。他们大讲世界革命斗争史，大颂毛主席对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展和贡献；大讲中国革命斗争史，大颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利；大讲劳动人民翻身史，大颂在毛主席英明领导下，社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光辉成就；大讲革命英雄成长史和自己在毛泽东思想哺育下的进步，大颂毛泽东思想的无比威力和活学活用毛主席著作的显著成就。大家越讲越颂，对毛主席的感情越深。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”六兵种两学院广大指战员和革命职工、家属，在斗争的实践中深刻地体验到：学了毛主席著作，用还是不用，学了毛主席最新指示，执行还是不执行，是检验是否忠于毛主席的根本标志，是区分完全革命派或口头革命派的分水岭。他们说得好：“用，是学习毛泽东思想的唯一目的；用，是掌握毛泽东思想的根本途径。”六兵种直属机关和两学院的无产阶级革命派，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席的最新指示为指针，敢于斗争，善于斗争，誓死捍卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，表现了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的指战员，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，雷厉风行地落实毛主席的最新指示。通信兵某部毛泽东思想宣传队，跋山涉水，行程七千多里，先后在三省十三县进行宣传，使毛主席的最新指示，迅速和广大群众见了面。铁道兵某部石景山中学军训团和装甲兵某部十八中军训团，一切服从最高统帅毛主席的命令，坚决执行支左不支派的原则，积极进行思想政治工作，促进两校迅速实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，成立了革命委员会，复课闹革命搞的轰轰烈烈。在洛阳某工厂执行支左任务的炮兵某部新战士罗祥宽，凭着对毛主席的一颗忠心，毛主席指到那里，就打到那里。毛主席发出了“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，他闻风而动，帮助两个车间的无产阶级革命派，连续开办了九期毛泽东思想学习班，革命群众热情地称赞他是学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的好榜样。广大指战员坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，以毛主席最新指示为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线。连续七年被评为四好连队的工程兵某部一连过去在施工中，反革命修正主义分子彭真、罗瑞卿几次去放毒，搞物质刺激，但他们始终坚持毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们对党内最大的一小撮走资派，展开了大批判，他们说：“阶级斗争千复杂，万复杂，有了一颗忠于毛主席的红心就看得清，站得稳。”
    六兵种两学院广大指战员和革命职工、家属，大办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席最新指示武装头脑，斗私批修，大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，大大促进了人的思想革命化。他们积极响应毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召。把自己的战斗岗位，和中国革命、世界革命的伟大事业联系在一起，他们为保卫毛主席施工，为保障无产阶级司令部通信顺畅勤奋工作，为保卫祖国不受侵犯英勇战斗，为全面落实毛主席的最新指示而努力奋斗。
