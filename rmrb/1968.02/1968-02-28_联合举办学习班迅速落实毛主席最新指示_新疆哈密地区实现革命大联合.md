Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the two major revolutionary mass organizations in the Hami region of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have, through the establishment of extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously combated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and successfully achieved revolutionary unity. The situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in the Hami region is becoming better and better.

On February 16, over 30,000 proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in the Hami region gathered together to celebrate the revolutionary unity of the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations. Deputy Political Commissar of the Xinjiang Military Region, Tan Kaiyun, Deputy Political Commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Zeng Ruqing, Deputy Political Director of the 7335 Unit, Chen Guan, and leaders from the Hami Military Sub-district and local troops went to extend warm congratulations. In recent days, joyous processions celebrating the achievement of revolutionary unity have frequently appeared on the streets of Hami. People waved red flags, beat drums, and joyfully went to the Hami Military Sub-district and the local troops' locations to report the good news. Representatives of various ethnic revolutionary masses from remote counties braved the cold, crossed mountains and rivers, and came to Hami City to report to the People's Liberation Army the news of their achievement of revolutionary unity, requesting the People's Liberation Army to convey their boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic peoples. Currently, all counties and dozens of factories, institutions, and schools in the Hami region have achieved revolutionary unity.

Hami is an important city in eastern Xinjiang. During the proletarian cultural revolution, due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the ghosts and snakes of society, as well as the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, the two major revolutionary mass organizations in the Hami region had serious antagonistic sentiments. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were conveyed here, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the two major revolutionary mass organizations in the Hami region jointly established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on "criticizing selfishness and revisionism," combating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthening proletarian party spirit, which effectively promoted the achievement of revolutionary unity.

At present, the entire Hami region is experiencing a broader and deeper wave of studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

    联合举办学习班迅速落实毛主席最新指示
    新疆哈密地区实现革命大联合
    据新华社乌鲁木齐二十七日电  在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，新疆维吾尔自治区哈密地区两大派革命群众组织，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，胜利地实现了革命大联合。哈密地区的无产阶级文化大革命形势越来越好。
    二月十六日，哈密地区三万多无产阶级革命派和各族革命群众欢聚一起，热烈庆祝两派革命群众组织实现革命大联合。人民解放军新疆军区副政委谭开云，新疆军区生产建设兵团副政委曾如清、七三三五部队政治部副主任陈冠以及哈密军分区和当地驻军的负责人，前往热烈祝贺。连日来，哈密街头不断出现欢庆实现革命大联合的报喜队伍。人们高举红旗，敲锣打鼓，兴高采烈地到哈密军分区和当地驻军所在地报喜。边远县分各族革命群众的代表，冒着严寒，翻山越岭，来到哈密城，向人民解放军报告他们实现革命大联合的喜讯，请人民解放军转达他们对各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的心意。目前，哈密地区所属各县和数十个工厂、机关、学校，都实现了革命大联合。
    哈密是新疆东部重镇。在无产阶级文化大革命中，由于党内一小撮走资派和社会上牛鬼蛇神的挑动，以及资产阶级反动路线的影响，哈密地区两大派革命群众组织对立情绪严重。毛主席的最新指示传到这里以后，在人民解放军的帮助下，哈密地区两大派革命群众组织普遍联合举办了毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，有力地促进了革命大联合的实现。
    现在，整个哈密地区，一个更广泛、更深入的学习和落实毛主席一系列最新指示的热潮正在向前发展。各族革命人民决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
