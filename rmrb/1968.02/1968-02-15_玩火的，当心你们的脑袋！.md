The east wind is strong, and good news is frequent. Following the downing of a U.S. military unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft in Yunnan on January 20, on February 14, our naval air force shot down and damaged one U.S. carrier-based attack aircraft each over the skies of Hainan Island. This is a heartening piece of news amidst the triumphant songs of the people's victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great achievement of the heroic People's Liberation Army, who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and emphasize proletarian politics. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! We extend our warmest congratulations to the naval air force, who have day and night guarded our sacred airspace and made new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The great People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is stronger than ever. Our naval air force, following the great commander Mao Zedong's instruction to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," fights bravely and fiercely in the battle to defend our airspace. As soon as the U.S. aggressor planes enter our airspace, they are immediately met with a crushing blow, reduced to smithereens, and in utter disarray. This brilliant victory once again demonstrates that a people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is invincible.

Today, the revolutionary situation in the world is excellent. Especially in Southeast Asia, the flames of people's revolutionary wars are burning everywhere. The heroic people of South Vietnam have dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in their recent Tet Offensive. However, all reactionary forces will not readily accept their defeat and will surely make desperate struggles. Recently, U.S. imperialism, in order to salvage its defeat in Vietnam, is hastening to plot the expansion of the Vietnam War, attempting to spread the flames of war to the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia, seeking a way out from new military adventures. Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "We still hope that those who play with fire will not be too reckless. We solemnly warn them: be careful, this fire is not to be trifled with, take care of your own heads."

U.S. imperialism should have long known that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with, nor are the peoples of Asia. The People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will not hesitate to counterattack invaders. The naval air force's downing and damaging of the invading U.S. planes today is a punishment for U.S. imperialism's war provocations and also support for the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting to the death against U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people have long been prepared and are standing in strict array. If the U.S. aggressors dare to impose war on the Chinese people, we will definitely see it through to the end and annihilate them completely!

    玩火的，当心你们的脑袋！

    东风劲吹，捷报频传。继一月二十日我空军部队在云南地区上空击落美国军用无人驾驶高空侦察飞机一架之后，二月十四日，我海军航空兵又在海南岛上空一举击落击伤美国舰载攻击机各一架。这是在全国人民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利凯歌声中的一个振奋人心的喜讯。这是英雄的人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、活学活用毛主席著作、突出无产阶级政治的伟大成果。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！我们谨向夜以继日地保卫祖国神圣领空、保卫无产阶级文化大革命立下了新功勋的海军航空兵，表示最热烈的祝贺！
    毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的伟大的中国人民解放军，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。这支军队，经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，比任何时候都更加强大。我们的海军航空兵，遵循伟大统帅毛主席“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的教导，在保卫祖国领空的战斗中敢打敢拚，敢于刺刀见红。美国强盗飞机一钻进我国领空，就立即遭到迎头痛击，被打得粉身碎骨，狼狈不堪。这次辉煌胜利，再一次显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队是不可战胜的。
    今天，全世界革命形势大好。特别是在东南亚到处燃起了人民革命战争的熊熊烈火。英雄的越南南方人民，在最近的新春攻势中，给予了美帝国主义及其走狗空前沉重的打击。但是，一切反动势力都不会甘心自己的失败，它们必然要进行疯狂的垂死挣扎。最近，美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南的败局，正在加紧策划扩大侵越战争，企图把战火烧到整个印度支那和东南亚，从新的军事冒险中寻找出路。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说过：“我们还是希望那班玩火的人，不要过于冲昏头脑。我们正式警告他们说：放谨慎一点吧，这种火是不好玩的，仔细你们自己的脑袋。”
    美帝国主义早就应该懂得中国人民并不是好惹的，亚洲各国人民并不是好惹的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军和中国人民，对于反击侵略者决不会手软。海军航空兵今天击落击伤入侵的美国飞贼，就是对于美帝国主义战争挑衅的惩罚，也是对正在同美帝国主义浴血奋战的英雄越南人民的支援。中国人民早已作好准备，严阵以待。如果美国强盗胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，我们就一定奉陪到底，坚决彻底干净全部消灭之！
