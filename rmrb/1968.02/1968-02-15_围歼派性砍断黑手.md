The prominent manifestation of the current anarchist reactionary trend is the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie.

The reactionary nature of factionalism determines its stubbornness. Like other enemies, it "will not withdraw from the historical stage on its own." We must raise the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, unite and attack it, and completely eliminate it.

Cunning enemies are not to be feared. What is to be feared is the presence of those in our ranks who are selfish and strong in factionalism. Their class struggle awareness gradually weakens, their thoughts veer to the right, and they are blinded by factionalism. As Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "Our people's eyes are not sharp, and they are not good at distinguishing good people from bad people. We are good at distinguishing good people from bad people in normal situations, but we are not good at distinguishing certain people in special situations." We hope that those comrades who have become "Mr. Dong Guo" but are not yet aware of it will quickly wake up, sharpen their eyes, distinguish between friends and enemies, and cut off the black hands! Fight alongside the broad revolutionary masses and take the initiative to attack the class enemy!

Many facts tell us that in places where "internal wars" frequently occur and last for a long time, and even where armed struggles break out, in nine out of ten cases, it is the bad elements who are stirring up trouble. They use various disguises as cover, even donning the red cloak of "rebels," hiding in the shadows to fan the flames, start fires, shoot arrows in the dark, and fire cold shots. In such a situation, no matter which faction of the revolutionary organizations the masses belong to, they must take the initiative to root out the bad elements and cut off the black hands. Once the bad elements mixed into each organization are all rooted out, they can unite against the enemy, and factionalism will have no place. Bad things will then turn into good things.

Now, the task of surrounding and eliminating factionalism and cutting off the black hands is before us. To overthrow factionalism, we must seize the core of factionalism—the "selfish" character and fight it to the end. The fight against selfishness should not be kept secret; keeping it secret is keeping selfishness. The "selfish" character must be broken; only by standing on the party's position and hating the "selfish" character and factionalism to the core, without mercy and without leniency, can we resolutely overthrow it.

### 围歼派性砍断黑手

    围歼派性砍断黑手
    当前无政府主义反动思潮的突出表现，就是资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性。
    派性的反动性又决定了它的顽固性。它和其他敌人一样，是“不会自行退出历史舞台”的。我们必须奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，群起而攻之，彻底消灭之。
    狡猾的敌人并不可怕。可怕的倒是我们队伍中私心重、派性强的人。他们的阶级斗争观念逐渐淡薄，思想右倾，被派性蒙住了阶级视线。正如毛主席早就指出的：“我们的人眼睛不亮，不善于辨别好人和坏人。我们善于辨别在正常情况之下从事活动的好人和坏人，但是我们不善于辨别在特殊情况下从事活动的某些人们。”我们希望那些当了“东郭先生”还不自觉的同志，迅速猛醒，擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，斩断黑手！同广大革命群众一起战斗，向阶级敌人主动进攻！
    许多事实告诉我们，凡是“内战”迭起、持久不断乃至发生武斗的地方，十有八九是坏人在兴风作浪。他们用各种各样的伪装作掩护，甚至披着“造反派”的红色外衣，躲在幕后煽阴风、点鬼火、射暗箭、放冷枪。在这种情况下，不论是那一派革命组织的群众，都要自动起来揪出坏人、斩断黑手。把各自组织里混进的坏人揪尽了，联合对敌了，派性没有市场了，坏事就会变成好事。
    现在，围歼派性、斩断黑手的战斗任务已摆在我们面前。打倒派性，必须抓住派性的核心——“私”字狠斗。斗私不应保“密”，保“密”就是保“私”；“私”字不破，派性难倒；只有站在党性的立场，对“私”字和派性恨之入骨，不手软，不留情，才能坚决打倒。
