The Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee and the Vietnam Fatherland Front Hanoi City Committee jointly held a rally on February 4 to warmly celebrate the brilliant victories achieved by the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians since the beginning of the new year. The meeting passed a resolution calling on the Vietnamese people nationwide to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call, to press forward and continue the offensive, and to decisively win a complete victory in the struggle against American imperialism to save the nation.

Chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee Presidium, Ton Duc Thang, Member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Member of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee Presidium, Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Hanoi City Committee, Nguyen Van Hau, and representatives from various parties, organizations, the military, and people from all walks of life in Hanoi attended the rally.

Deputy Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to North Vietnam, Nguyen Phu Tho, also attended the rally.

In his opening speech, Ton Duc Thang pointed out that the Vietnamese people are now facing a great opportunity to defeat the enemy and achieve a complete victory. He said that the people of North Vietnam are determined to do their utmost in all aspects to advance side by side with their fellow countrymen in the South, to defeat American imperialist aggressors and their lackeys, to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the nation.

Nguyen Huu Tho, in his speech at the rally, warmly celebrated the great victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians. Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out that the recent revolutionary upsurge among the people of South Vietnam marks a leap forward in the struggle against American imperialism to save the nation. The notable features of this development are continuous offensives, widespread resistance, and the achievement of increasingly significant victories; resolute advancement, the defeat of the enemy, and the attainment of a complete victory.

Nguyen Huu Tho said that the situation in the South is developing in an unprecedentedly favorable direction. However, American imperialism remains obstinate and is plotting new schemes. Nevertheless, in the face of an invincible people's war, their actions are merely the last struggles of a dying beast, which can only further arouse the Vietnamese people's hatred towards the enemy.

Nguyen Huu Tho called on the people of North and South Vietnam to contribute all their strength to liberate the South, to fully and promptly meet the demands of the front line, and to be ready at any time to smash any escalation of the war by the American aggressors.

Representatives from various Vietnamese parties, organizations, ethnic groups, and religions also spoke at the rally, warmly congratulating the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians on their brilliant victories, and expressing their determination to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call, to vigorously launch competitions, to promote production and combat, to fight side by side with their fellow countrymen in the South, and to decisively defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys.

The representatives at the rally unanimously passed a resolution. The resolution stated that the 17 million people in the North, with the spirit of "everything for our flesh-and-blood South," are determined to contribute all their strength to the cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and reunifying the nation. Under any circumstances, they will be ready at any time to fully, promptly, and effectively meet the maximum demands of the South's revolution and fulfill the obligations of the rear to the front line.

The resolution expressed that the people of the North, under the wise leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party headed by beloved Chairman Ho, with the spirit of "everything for the complete defeat of the American aggressors," will resolutely unite more closely, heighten vigilance, be ready at any time to smash any escalation of the war by the American aggressors, and excellently and exceedingly complete production and combat tasks.

The resolution called on the people of the world to more powerfully support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism, and to timely and resolutely cut off the bloody claws of the American aggressors and their lackeys.

The resolution called on the Vietnamese people nationwide to press forward, to vigorously carry out the offensive, to decisively realize Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, and to win the final victory.

The resolution firmly believed that American imperialism and its lackeys will be defeated! The Vietnamese people will surely achieve complete victory!
