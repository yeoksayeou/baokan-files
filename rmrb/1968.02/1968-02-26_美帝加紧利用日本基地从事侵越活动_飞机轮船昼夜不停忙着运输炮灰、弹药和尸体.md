The U.S. empire, which is being severely beaten by the strong spring offensive of the South Vietnamese people and is desperately struggling to survive, has recently intensified its use of its military bases in Japan to frantically expand its aggression in Vietnam.

According to the *Mainichi Shimbun*, recently, the activities of U.S. military aircraft at the Okinawa base have been extremely frequent. Fifteen B-52 bombers and thirty large transport planes stationed at the Kadena Air Base have been taking off day and night, reaching up to 200 sorties per day. At the Naha military port, a large U.S. transport ship loaded with 5,000 American soldiers set sail on the 17th. At the Naha commercial port, a large cargo ship loaded with military cement has set sail for South Vietnam.

According to the recently published *Asahi Weekly*, the Yokota base near Tokyo has been continuously receiving large batches of American corpses transported from South Vietnam. The weekly reports that every day, three to six transport planes, each carrying 350 bodies, are flying back to the United States full of corpses.

The weekly also revealed that the U.S. field hospitals in and around Tokyo are now full of American wounded soldiers from South Vietnam. Some hospitals have even placed beds in their dining halls and clubs. *Asahi Weekly* laments: "Tokyo has become the 'central logistics base' for the Vietnam War."

    飞机轮船昼夜不停忙着运输炮灰、弹药和尸体
    据新华社讯　东京消息：被南越军民的新春强大攻势打得焦头烂额、正在进行垂死挣扎的美帝国主义，最近加紧利用它在日本的军事基地，紧张从事扩大侵越战争的活动。
    据《每日新闻》报道，最近，冲绳基地的美军飞机的活动非常频繁。进驻嘉手纳空军基地的十五架B—52型轰炸机和三十架大型运输机不分昼夜地起飞，每天达二百架次。在那霸军港，美国大型运输船十七日装载五千名美国兵出港。在那霸商港，装载军用水泥的大型货轮已开往南越。
    据最近出版的《朝日周刊》透露，东京附近的横田基地，最近不断收到从南越运来的大批美军尸体。周刊说，每天都有三至六架每架载三百五十人的运输机，满载死尸飞往美国。
    这家周刊还透露，东京市内和周围的美军野战医院最近都住满了来自南越的美国伤兵。有的医院连食堂和俱乐部都摆满了病床。《朝日周刊》哀叹：东京已成了进行越南战争的“中央兵站基地”。
