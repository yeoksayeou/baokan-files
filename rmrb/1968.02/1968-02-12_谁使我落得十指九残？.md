    Who Made Me End Up with Nine Broken Fingers?
    Tianjin Lamp Factory Worker from San Tiao Shi, Wang Fuyuan

    Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The Chinese proletariat is subjected to three kinds of oppression (oppression by imperialism, oppression by the bourgeoisie, and oppression by feudal forces), and the severity and cruelty of these oppressions are rarely seen in the history of any other nation;..."

    However, the Chinese Khrushchev sings a different tune from Chairman Mao, shouting, "Let you (referring to the capitalist) exploit me a bit, they (referring to the workers) ask you to exploit them, and they feel comfortable when you exploit them a bit, but if you don't exploit them, they feel pain." Shut up! Chinese Khrushchev, you are not allowed to insult our working class! Today, I will use my accusations against the old society to refute the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "exploitation is beneficial."

    I am 62 years old. Forty-four years ago, I was an apprentice at the "Sanhecheng" iron workshop in San Tiao Shi. I suffered immense hardships, and only after a long time did I finally become a skilled worker. However, I did not escape the pit of suffering and continued to be cruelly exploited by the capitalists. Soon after, the capitalist bought a punch press, which became his money-making machine. Forty years ago, no one had seen a punch press, so naturally, no one knew how to operate it. The boss was afraid that others would take over his business, so he treated this machine like a treasure. He not only forbade others from touching it but also from even looking at it. From that time on, the boss locked me and the machine together in a small, dark, and damp room. I would enter in the morning before dawn and only be let out after midnight, locked in for a whole day. I couldn't even go out to eat, drink, or use the toilet, living a life more miserable than being in prison. After a month of this torture, I was completely broken. I was always in a daze, unable to open my eyes. Once, as I was about to wipe my eyes, the machine started, and the punch came down, crushing my right thumb. The boss only cared about making money and didn't care about the workers' lives or deaths. When he heard about the accident, he didn't pay any attention. Seeing that my hand was hurting and I couldn't work, he was afraid the machine would stop, so he sent me to a traditional medicine shop in "Shi Qiao" to get some ointment and that was it. Who would have thought that my hand would soon rot? Seeing that it was serious, I went back to the doctor, who said, "You must cut off the finger at the root, otherwise, you will have to amputate the arm." So, with a rusty pair of scissors, my finger was cut off, and I immediately fainted from the pain. When I woke up, my thumb was gone, and the wound was excruciatingly painful. After more than half a month, my hand was not yet fully healed, but the boss forced me back to the machine to do the hard work.

    At that time, the capitalists only cared about making money and didn't care about the workers' lives or deaths. I had already lost one finger, and while working, I was afraid of being hit again, so I used chopsticks to hold the iron. The capitalist saw this and said I was slacking off. He beat me up and broke the chopsticks, so I had to continue working with my hands. After a few more times, within a year, I lost my middle finger as well.

    The third time I was on the machine, I heard that the machine's sound was unusual, indicating a problem. I told the capitalist to have someone fix it, but he not only didn't care but also scolded me for meddling. As a result, not long after, because the machine was broken, another three of my fingers were crushed. This time, the injury was the worst. The mold was filled with flesh and blood, making it look like a bloody gourd.

    In less than four years, I lost six of my ten fingers, becoming a disabled person who couldn't even tie his own belt. At this time, the capitalist was still not satisfied and continued to squeeze every last drop from me. Less than three years later, my other three fingers were also crushed by the machine. I was left with only one good finger. The capitalist saw that he could no longer squeeze any more out of me, so he kicked me out of "Sanhecheng," forcing my family into a desperate situation. Fortunately, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party saved me from the pit of suffering, giving me the life I have today.

    In seven years, I was cruelly exploited by the capitalist, ending up with nine broken fingers. However, the capitalist of "Sanhecheng" exploited the workers and developed from having no machines to having machines, and his capital grew from eight silver dollars to 620,000 yuan. Marx said well: "Capital comes into the world dripping from head to toe, from every pore, with blood and dirt." The bourgeoisie built their evil "paradise" on the piles of white bones of the proletariat!

    The facts are clear. The Chinese Khrushchev crazily advocates the theory of "exploitation is beneficial" to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Today, with the working class here, you, Chinese Khrushchev, will not be able to dream of restoring capitalism!

### 谁使我落得十指九残？

    谁使我落得十指九残？
    天津制灯厂三条石老工人　王福元
    毛主席早就指出：“中国无产阶级身受三种压迫（帝国主义的压迫、资产阶级的压迫、封建势力的压迫），而这些压迫的严重性和残酷性，是世界各民族中少见的；……”
    可是中国赫鲁晓夫却和毛主席大唱反调，叫嚷什么“请你（按：指资本家）剥削我一下吧，他们（按：指工人）叫你剥削，能剥削他们一下，倒感到舒服一些，你不剥削，他们倒觉得痛苦。”住嘴！中国赫鲁晓夫，不准你侮辱我们工人阶级！今天，我要用对旧社会的控诉，来痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论。
    我今年六十二岁，四十四年前，我在三条石“三合成”铁工厂当学徒，受尽了牛马苦，好不容易才算熬到出了师，可并没有跳出火坑，还照样受资本家残酷剥削。没多久，资本家买了一台冲床，成了他的摇钱树。四十多年前冲床可没人见过，自然也没人会使。掌柜生怕别人顶了他的买卖，就拿这台冲床当了宝贝，甭说叫别人动，连看也不叫看。从那时候起掌柜就把我和机器一起锁在一间又黑又潮的小黑屋里。早晨不亮进去，夜里十二点多才放出来，一锁就是一天。连吃饭、喝水、上厕所都不叫出去，过着比坐监狱都难受的生活。这样一个来月，可把我折磨坏了。整天迷迷糊糊的，眼也睁不开。一次我正要擦眼，机器一转，冲子下来了，正把我右手大拇指砸上。掌柜的就为赚钱，哪管工人死活，听说出了事，根本没上心里去。看我手疼的干不了活，怕机器停了，才叫我到“石桥”一家中药铺瞧了瞧，上了点药膏，就算了事。哪知道这手没几天就烂了，一看不对，又找那医生一瞧，他说：“非把手指头连根铰掉，要不，胳膊也得锯。”于是，一把生锈的剪子，把我手指头一铰，立时我就疼昏过去。醒过来一看，大拇指没了，伤口痛得钻心。过了半个多月，手还没好利索，掌柜又逼我上机器干闷活。
    那时资本家净为了赚钱，根本不问工人死活。我已经砸了一个手指头，干活时怕再挨砸，就用筷子夹着续铁。那想资本家一看见，就说我磨洋工，打了我一顿不算，还把那筷子也给撅了，只好再靠手续铁。三续两续，没过一年，把中指也切掉了。
    我第三次上机器后，就听机器响声不对劲，有毛病，跟资本家说，让他叫人修理，可他不但没管，还骂我多事，结果没多少日子，因机器坏了，我的手又一块砸下来三个指头。这次砸的比哪次都厉害，模子里连骨头带肉模模糊糊，简直成了血葫芦。
    连前带后不到四年，我十个手指头就砸掉了六个，变成个残废，连裤带都扎不了。这时候，资本家还不死心，继续敲我的骨，吸我的髓。过后不到三年的时间，我另三个手指头又先后被机器都砸掉了。我这一双手，就剩下一个好指头，资本家看从我身上再也挤不出啥油水来了，就一脚把我踢出“三合成”，逼得我一家人走投无路。多亏毛主席和共产党把我从火坑中救了出来，才有我的今天。
    我七年工夫，被资本家残酷剥削，落得十指九残。可“三合成”的资本家靠着剥削工人，却由没机器发展到有机器，资金由八块银元发展到六十二万元。马克思说得好：“资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。”资产阶级正是在无产阶级的累累白骨之上，建筑起了他们罪恶的“天堂”啊！
    事实很清楚，中国赫鲁晓夫发疯地鼓吹“剥削有功”论，就是为复辟资本主义制造舆论。今天有我们工人阶级在，你中国赫鲁晓夫休想做复辟资本主义的美梦！
