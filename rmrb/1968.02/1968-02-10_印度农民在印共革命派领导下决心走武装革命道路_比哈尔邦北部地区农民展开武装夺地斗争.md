Indian farmers, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have decided to take the road of armed revolution. In the northern region of Bihar State, farmers have launched an armed struggle to seize land.

New Delhi, February 8 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the northern region of Bihar State in India, farmers, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, are carrying out an armed struggle to seize land.

The *Hindustan Times* reported on February 5 that in the western part of Bihar State, near the border with Nepal, there is a forest called Mandapur. Thousands of landless laborers have violently seized back a large area of land that was forcibly taken by the authorities.

The newspaper also revealed that some leaders who initiated the Nasalbari struggle, led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have come to the northern region of Bihar State and are engaged in organizational and mobilization work. The reactionary police authorities also believe that they have come to this region "to plan and direct the Nasalbari-style struggle throughout the border area."

The Bihar State government is extremely fearful of the farmers' land struggle. To "prevent the outbreak of 'Nasalbari-style' land troubles in the northern part of Bihar State, which borders West Bengal, Nepal, and Uttar Pradesh," it is intensifying the brutal suppression of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, which leads the farmers' land struggle. By the beginning of February, the reactionary government had arrested about 200 revolutionaries who had initiated the farmers' struggle to seize land in this region.

Armed farmers have strongly retaliated against the reactionary government's suppression. According to reports, on January 30, near the India-Nepal border, when a group of reactionary police were escorting three captured farmer leaders through the dense forest, they were ambushed by 200 armed civilians. The ambushers injured 19 police officers and rescued the captured leaders from the police's jeep.

Under the brutal exploitation of the Indian reactionaries and feudal landlords, the farmers of Bihar State suffer deeply. During the Indian famine last year, at least 40 million of the 50 million people in Bihar State went hungry, the vast majority of whom were farmers. Tens of millions of farmers were on the brink of death. The armed struggle of farmers in the northern region of Bihar State to seize land shows that the broad masses of farmers in this region are rising up to resist the evil rule of the Indian reactionary government. The brutal suppression of the Indian reactionary government cannot stop them from rising up in revolution; instead, it only makes them more determined to take the revolutionary road.

    印度农民在印共革命派领导下决心走武装革命道路
    比哈尔邦北部地区农民展开武装夺地斗争
    新华社八日讯　新德里消息：印度比哈尔邦北部地区农民在印共革命派的领导下，正在开展武装夺地斗争。
    据《印度斯坦时报》五日透露，在比哈尔邦西北部同尼泊尔交界的昌帕兰县有一个曼达普尔森林，在这个森林里及其周围的大片被官方强占的土地，已经被数千名无地的劳动者用暴力夺回了。
    这家报纸还透露，印共革命派发动纳萨尔巴里斗争的一些领导人来到了比哈尔邦北部地区，正在进行组织和动员工作。反动警察当局也认为，他们到这个地区“是计划和指导整个边境地区的纳萨尔巴里式的斗争的。”
    比哈尔邦政府对农民土地斗争非常害怕，为了“提防在同西孟加拉邦、尼泊尔和北方邦邻接的比哈尔邦北部爆发‘纳萨尔巴里式的’土地麻烦”，正在加紧对领导农民土地斗争的印共革命派进行残酷镇压。到二月初为止，反动政府在这个地区已逮捕了约二百名发动农民开展夺地斗争的革命者。
    武装起来的农民对反动政府的镇压进行了有力的回击。据报道，一月三十日在印度同尼泊尔边界附近，正当一群反动警察押送三名被捕的农民领导人穿过密林时，遭到了二百名武装起来的群众的伏击，伏击者打伤了十九名警察，从警察的吉普车上救走了被捕的领导人。
    在印度反动派和封建地主的残酷剥削下，比哈尔邦的农民苦难深重。在去年印度大饥荒中，比哈尔邦五千万人口中至少有四千万人挨饿，其中绝大多数是农民。数以百万计的农民处在死亡的边缘。比哈尔邦北部地区农民武装夺地斗争表明，这个地区的广大农民正在奋起反抗印度反动政府的罪恶统治。印度反动政府的残酷镇压无法阻挡他们起来革命，相反，只能促使他们更加坚决地走革命的道路。
