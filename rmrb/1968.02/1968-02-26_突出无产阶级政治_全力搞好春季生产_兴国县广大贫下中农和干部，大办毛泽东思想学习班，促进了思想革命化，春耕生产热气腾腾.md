The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, under the leadership of the county revolutionary committee, have been following Chairman Mao's teachings: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." They have resolutely taken the path of emphasizing politics, holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and are determined to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking and launch the first wave of spring production.

	On the eve of the spring production campaign, the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee resolutely used Mao Zedong Thought to guide production. Members of the committee went deep into the countryside and held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. From the county seat to the towns, from the communes, brigades, production teams to the hamlets and households, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held everywhere. The poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the entire county studied, discussed, and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the study classes; they fought hard against selfishness, dug deep into the roots of revisionism, and firmly established the spirit of public service. "'Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory,' learn from Dazhai, catch up with Dazhai, farm for the revolution, launch the first wave of spring production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," has become the common vow of the 380,000 revolutionary people in the entire county.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in Changgang Township (now Changgang Brigade of Changgang Commune), the revolutionary base area where our great leader Chairman Mao conducted the "Changgang Survey" 35 years ago, unanimously expressed their determination to turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into conscious revolutionary actions and actively participate in spring production. On the first day of the Spring Festival, the entire brigade of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres held a rally to launch the first wave of spring production, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." At the meeting, Wu Caifang, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the secretary of the Changgang Brigade Party Committee, first conveyed to all the community members the joyful scene of him, representing the poor and lower-middle peasants of Changgang, reporting to Chairman Mao in Beijing and being received by Chairman Mao. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were deeply moved and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Everyone said, "Chairman Mao cares so much about us poor and lower-middle peasants in Changgang. This is the greatest encouragement and greatest spur for us. We must, with our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions actively, and launch the first wave of spring production." The Sanwang Piece of Changgang Brigade, in order to further promote the revolutionization of people's thinking and achieve a bumper harvest, actively organized cadres to participate in the study classes and trained 34 instructors to go deep into the production teams and guide the community members in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Yongfeng Commune Shaoxi Brigade is a Dazhai-style brigade in the entire county. This brigade originally planned to build a 9-kilometer-long irrigation canal, aiming to complete half of it before spring production and the other half by the end of the year. Through studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, everyone realized that every inch of the irrigation canal built, every acre of dry land irrigated, and every pound of grain increased would contribute to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The entire brigade of cadres and community members decided to complete the 9-kilometer-long irrigation canal before spring production.

	The Shangshe Supply and Marketing Cooperative is following the footsteps of revolutionary predecessors, step by step following Chairman Mao. They have turned the cooperative into a propaganda station for Mao Zedong Thought. The clerks are all competing to be propagandists of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to be diligent servants who "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, and to be fighters who launch the first wave of spring production. They are not afraid of high mountains and long roads, actively delivering goods to the production teams, and spreading Chairman Mao's latest instructions wherever they go. The broad masses of cadres in the entire county are also actively going deep into the front lines of spring production, promoting revolution and production, and boldly leading spring production. They said, "We must carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the old cadres in the Soviet area, work hard, solve problems carefully, adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be good organizers and leaders of spring production. We must take the lead in spring production and be the vanguard."

	At present, the broad revolutionary masses and cadres in Xingguo County are studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions extensively, criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi pushed in the countryside, promoting revolution, and boosting production. The entire county's work on seed selection, preparation for farming, and fertilizer accumulation is being done with great enthusiasm.

    突出无产阶级政治　全力搞好春季生产
    兴国县广大贫下中农和干部，大办毛泽东思想学习班，促进了思想革命化，春耕生产热气腾腾
    本报讯　江西省兴国县广大贫下中农和农村基层干部，在县革命委员会的领导下，遵照毛主席的教导：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，坚定地走突出政治的道路，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，决心以毛主席最新指示为纲，搞好人的思想革命化，打响春耕生产第一炮。
    春耕生产高潮到来的前夕，兴国县革命委员会坚决用毛泽东思想统帅生产，革委会成员纷纷深入到农村，和广大贫下中农一起举办毛泽东思想学习班。从县城到场镇，从公社、大队、生产队到屋场和家庭，普遍办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。全县贫下中农社员和农村基层干部，在学习班里，大学大讲大用毛主席的最新指示；狠斗“私”字，深挖“修”根，大立“公”字。“‘发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣’，学大寨，赶大寨，为革命种好田，打响春耕生产第一炮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利”，已成为全县三十八万革命人民的共同誓言。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在三十五年前作“长冈调查”的革命老根据地长冈乡（现长冈公社长冈大队）的贫下中农社员和干部，一致表示要以战斗的姿态，把毛主席的最新指示，变为自觉的革命行动，积极投入春耕生产。春节第一天，全大队贫下中农和干部，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高举毛主席画像，举行了打响春耕生产第一炮的誓师大会。在会上，江西省革命委员会常委、长冈大队党支部书记吴才枋首先向全体社员传达了他代表长冈的贫下中农到北京向毛主席汇报，毛主席接见他时的幸福情景。广大贫下中农万分激动，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”大家说：“毛主席他老人家这样关怀我们长冈贫下中农，这是对我们的最大鼓励、最大鞭策，我们一定以对毛主席的无限忠诚，活学活用毛主席最新指示，打响春耕生产第一炮。”长冈大队的泗网片，为了进一步促进人的思想革命化，夺取农业大丰收，干部积极带头参加学习班，并培养了三十四个辅导员，深入到各生产队，辅导社员学习毛主席的最新指示。
    永丰公社蕉溪大队，是全县一个大寨式的大队。这个大队原计划修建一条九公里长的水渠，准备春耕生产前完成一半，另一半到年底再完成。通过在毛泽东思想学习班学习，大家认识到，多修一尺水渠，多灌溉一亩旱地，多增产一斤粮食，就多为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利贡献一分力量。全大队干部、社员决心要在春耕生产前把九公里水渠修好。
    上社供销社，正在踏着革命前辈的足迹，步步紧跟毛主席。他们把供销社办成了毛泽东思想的宣传站，营业员人人争当毛主席最新指示的宣传员，争做“完全”“彻底”为贫下中农服务的勤务员，争做打响春耕生产第一炮的战斗员。他们不怕山高路远，主动送货到生产队，走到哪里，就把毛主席的最新指示宣传到哪里。全县广大干部也积极地深入春耕生产第一线，抓革命，促生产，大胆地领导春耕生产。他们说：“我们要发扬苏区老干部的革命传统，认真地工作，仔细地解决问题，坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，当好春耕生产的组织者和领导者。一定要在春耕生产第一线打头阵，当尖兵。”
    现在，兴国县广大革命群众和革命干部正在大学毛主席的最新指示，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的反革命修正主义路线，抓革命，促生产。全县选种、备耕、积肥等项工作搞得热气腾腾。
