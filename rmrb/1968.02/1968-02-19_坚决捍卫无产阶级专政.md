	Resolutely Defend the Dictatorship of the Proletariat
	Xi Youying Village Militia Company Commander Xu Zhongyi

	The Chinese Khrushchev says, "Now, domestic enemies have basically been eliminated, the landlord class has long been eliminated, the bourgeoisie has also basically been eliminated, and counter-revolutionaries have also basically been eliminated. 'The contradiction between the enemy and us has basically been resolved.' This is sheer nonsense! The facts of class struggle in our brigade show that the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" he advocates is a thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary fallacy, aiming to deceive us poor and lower-middle peasants and achieve the restoration of capitalism. This is a pipe dream!

	I am the son of a poor peasant. From a young age, I suffered immense exploitation and oppression from the landlords. It was only thanks to Chairman Mao that I was rescued from my misery. Under Chairman Mao's guidance, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xi Youying Brigade organized ourselves and took the cooperative path to prosperity. In a short time, we changed our poor and backward face. I have a deep love for the dictatorship of the proletariat and am determined to forever defend our red homeland.

	In 1951, I proudly joined the Chinese People's Volunteers and fought in Korea, where I was wounded. In 1957, when I was demobilized and returned to my hometown, I found that the party and government powers in our brigade had been usurped by the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in Xi Youying, a rich peasant element. She colluded with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the entire village, successively driving out five outstanding party members and cadres from the brigade, placing her own trusted followers in important leadership positions, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

	After understanding the situation, I, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, launched a face-to-face struggle against the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in Xi Youying. At that time, the poor and lower-middle peasants were oppressed and dared not speak out, so I took the lead. "If you dare to cut off my head, I dare to pull the emperor off his horse." This infuriated the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in Xi Youying, who saw me as a thorn in her side and a bone in her throat, using every means to harass me and fabricating seven major charges against me, such as malicious attacks on the party branch, sabotage of the agricultural cooperative, serious bourgeois ideology, and so on, to frame me and force me to confess. I thought: If you want to restore capitalism, I will lead the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's works and mobilize the masses to rebel against you. Seeing that threats did not work, they held struggle sessions and used unreasonable detention and other means to persecute me. Whenever I thought of Chairman Mao, I was full of energy. Chairman Mao said, "The basic masses of workers and peasants are on our side." With Chairman Mao backing us from above and the poor and lower-middle peasants giving us courage from below, I was not afraid of anything. This group of jumping clowns, failing in one scheme, tried another, and actually, without the consent of all party members, expelled me from the party, saying that I did not meet the qualifications of a Communist Party member. I thought: You say I do not meet the qualifications of a Communist Party member because I have exposed your schemes. I believe that mastering Mao Zedong Thought will definitely lead to victory. I followed Chairman Mao from above and relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants from below, fighting against them for seven years.

	In 1964, Chairman Mao sent the Four Clean-ups work team, and I finally saw the light of day again. With the help of the work team, we thoroughly overthrew the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in Xi Youying, reclaimed the usurped leadership, and the work team rectified my case and restored my party membership. Revolution made me realize that Beijing is near, and rebellion made me feel even closer to Chairman Mao. I was so moved that tears welled up in my eyes. I shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao! It was Chairman Mao who liberated us, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xi Youying, for the second time.

	With power, we have everything; without power, we have nothing. The Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to usurp the leadership of the proletariat in the countryside and achieve the restoration of capitalism, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, is a pipe dream and a foolish wish. In the future, I will definitely use my life to defend the revolutionary power of the proletariat, use Mao Zedong Thought to hold power well, use power well, and ensure that the socialist homeland remains red forever.

    坚决捍卫无产阶级专政
    西右营大队民兵连连长　徐仲义
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“现在国内敌人已经基本被消灭了，地主阶级早已被消灭了，资产阶级也基本被消灭，反革命也基本被消灭了。”“敌我矛盾已经基本解决了。”这完全是胡说八道！我们大队阶级斗争的事实，说明他所宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭”论是地地道道的反革命谬论，是妄想蒙蔽我们贫下中农的眼睛，达到复辟资本主义的目的。这是梦想！
    我是一个贫农的儿子，从小就受尽了地主的剥削压迫，全靠毛主席把我从苦水里救出来。在毛主席的教导下，我们西右营大队贫下中农组织起来，走合作化的康庄大道，在短短的时间内，改变了贫穷落后的面貌。我对无产阶级专政充满了爱，我决心要永远保住我们红色的江山。
    一九五一年，我光荣地参加了中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜作过战，负过伤。一九五七年从部队复员回到家乡时，我发觉我们队里的党政大权给中国赫鲁晓夫在西右营的代理人、富农分子篡夺了。她和全村的地、富、反、坏右分子相勾结，先后把五名优秀的党员干部排挤出大队，在重要的领导岗位上安插自己的亲信，对广大贫下中农实行资产阶级专政。
    了解了情况，我就和贫下中农一起对中国赫鲁晓夫在西右营的代理人展开了面对面的斗争。当时贫下中农受压抑，有话不敢说，我就带头说。“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马。”这下可触怒了中国赫鲁晓夫在西右营的代理人，把我看成眼中钉，肉中刺，千方百计地刁难我，并无中生有地给我捏造了七大罪状，什么恶意攻击党支部，破坏农业合作社，资产阶级思想严重……等等，整我的黑材料，要我低头认罪。我想：你要复辟资本主义，我就领导贫下中农学习毛主席著作，发动群众造你的反。他们见威胁不成，又召开斗争会，采取无理拘留等手段来整我，迫害我。我一想起毛主席就浑身是劲。毛主席说：“工农基本群众是在我们方面”。上有毛主席撑腰，下有贫下中农壮胆，我什么也不怕。这群跳梁小丑，一计不成又施一计，竟然不通过全体党员，把我开除出党，说我不够一个共产党员条件。我想：你们说我不够一个共产党员条件，是因为我拆了你们的台。我相信掌握了毛泽东思想一定会取得胜利。我上跟毛主席，下靠贫下中农，一直同他们斗争了七年。
    一九六四年，毛主席派来了四清工作队，我才重新见到了曙光。在工作队的帮助下，我们彻底打倒了中国赫鲁晓夫在西右营的代理人，夺回了被篡夺的领导权，工作队给我平了反，恢复了我的党籍。革命方知北京近，造反更觉毛主席亲。我激动得热泪盈眶。我一千遍、一万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！是毛主席他老人家第二次解放了我们西右营的贫下中农。
    有权则有我们贫下中农的一切，无权则没有我们贫下中农的一切。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想在农村篡夺无产阶级领导权，实现资本主义复辟，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，这是白日做梦，痴心妄想。今后，我一定要用生命来捍卫无产阶级的革命政权，用毛泽东思想来掌好权，用好权，让社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色。
