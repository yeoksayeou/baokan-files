The Afro-Asian Writers' Association held a meeting in Beijing to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of American black leader W.E.B. Du Bois. The event aimed to carry forward the anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit and to eliminate U.S. imperialism and old and new colonialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his 1963 August telegram of condolence on the death of Dr. Du Bois, said: "Dr. Du Bois is a great man of our time. His heroic struggle for the liberation of the black people and all mankind, his outstanding achievements in the field of scholarship, and his sincere friendship for the Chinese people will forever be remembered by the Chinese people." Today, in Beijing, friends from various countries, gathered at the Afro-Asian Writers' Association, recalled Chairman Mao's appraisal of Du Bois and commemorated the 100th anniversary of his birth.

Dr. Du Bois was a renowned black leader, anti-imperialist warrior, writer, and scholar from the United States. His life was a life of struggle, a life of seeking truth and walking the path of thorough revolution. He fought bravely for the freedom, equality, and liberation of black Americans. In 1959, at the age of 91, Du Bois traveled across the ocean to visit China and had the honor of being received by our great leader Chairman Mao. Like a seedling receiving the nourishment of rain, Du Bois' life shone with new light. In his later years, he dedicated himself to the complete liberation of all mankind and embarked on the path of struggling for communism. He studied Chairman Mao's works diligently and, in his speeches, called out to the people of Africa: "Africa, arise! Face the rising sun! China is your closest kin."

Attending today's commemoration were Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and Zhang Zhirou, Xu Guangping, Chu Tu-nan, and Ding Xilin.

Also present were Du Bois' wife Shirley Graham, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Association Sannanayake, representatives from member countries of the Association such as Sudan's Kair, Japan's Saionji Koji, and Indonesia's Affif, General Secretary of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association Chahato, American black leader Robert Williams, and representatives from international organizations and national liberation movements in Beijing.

Guo Moruo spoke at the commemoration. He said, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the struggle of the oppressed black people in the United States is advancing towards victory. We must continue to carry forward Dr. Du Bois' indomitable spirit in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, unite with the black people of the United States and all oppressed nations and peoples, and eliminate imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States.

Guo Moruo said, Chairman Mao's 1963 August statement "In Support of the American Negroes in Their Just Struggle Against Racial Discrimination by U.S. Imperialism" is like a beacon, pointing the way to liberation for the American black people and all oppressed peoples, providing them with the theoretical weapon for revolutionary struggle. This great document, after its publication, further awakened the American black people, who broke free from the shackles of "non-violence" and launched a vigorous armed struggle against violence. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose to prosperity with the enslavement and trafficking of black people, will surely come to an end with the thorough liberation of the black race." Chairman Mao's great prophecy will surely become a shining reality.

Shirley Graham, Du Bois' wife, spoke about Du Bois' life. She said, Du Bois was a researcher, educator, historian, sociologist, and poet, but above all, he was a revolutionary. Shirley Graham recalled the scene when Du Bois and she visited China and were received by Chairman Mao. She said, Du Bois saw the rising red sun in the East in China, found the truth, and regained his youthful vigor, continuing his unyielding struggle for revolution.

Shirley Graham said, on the occasion of commemorating the 100th anniversary of Du Bois' birth, I pay tribute to the black people of the United States, who, with the slogan of "black power," are pushing the proletarian mass movement in the United States towards the revolutionary road. She said, the aggression of the United States will be stopped by the awakening of the people of the world, and imperialism is doomed to die.

Shirley Graham said, today, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has pushed the revolution to an unprecedented height in human history. Commemorating Du Bois' birth during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China fills me with joy and inspiration. Shirley Graham concluded her speech by passionately reciting Du Bois' favorite words by Chairman Mao: "The east is about to dawn, do not say you are setting out early. Having traversed all the green mountains, one is still young. The scenery here is uniquely good..."

Sannanayake, in his speech, condemned the Soviet revisionists and their followers for acting as lackeys of U.S. imperialism, distorting Du Bois' political stance of fighting against imperialism and colonialism led by the United States, and various reactionaries, attempting to portray Du Bois as a passive peace worker, thereby undermining the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the American people and other oppressed peoples. He said, at this time, the Afro-Asian Writers' Association calls on all revolutionary and progressive black people in the United States and other peoples to resolutely fight against imperialism led by the United States, against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and all reactionaries.

Du Bois' love for our great leader Chairman Mao and his fighting spirit moved everyone. All the speeches at the commemoration were met with thunderous applause.

    亚非作家常设局纪念美国著名黑人领袖杜波依斯诞生一百周年
    发扬反帝革命精神　消灭美帝和新老殖民主义
    陈毅副总理等出席　郭沫若、杜波依斯夫人和森纳那亚克讲了话
    新华社二十三日讯我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在一九六三年八月电唁杜波依斯博士逝世时说：“杜波依斯博士是我们时代的一位伟人。他为黑人和全人类的解放进行英勇斗争的事迹，他在学术上的卓越成就，和他对中国人民的真挚友谊，将永远留在中国人民的记忆里。”今天，在北京的各国朋友在亚非作家常设局举行的纪念会上，重温毛主席对杜波依斯作的这一评价，纪念杜波依斯博士诞生一百周年。
    杜波依斯博士是美国著名的黑人领袖、反帝战士、作家、学者，他的一生是战斗的一生，是寻求真理走上彻底革命道路的一生，他坚决为美国黑人的自由、平等和解放事业进行英勇的斗争。一九五九年，杜波依斯在他九十一岁高龄的时候，远涉重洋来到中国访问，并且荣幸地受到了伟大领袖毛主席的接见。象禾苗得到雨露的滋润，杜波依斯的生命从此又发出了新的光辉，晚年决心献身于全人类的彻底解放事业，走上为共产主义而奋斗的道路。他努力学习毛主席著作，在演说中向非洲人民大声呼唤：“非洲，起来吧，面向升起的太阳！”“中国是你们最亲密的血肉”。
    参加今天纪念会的，有国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若以及张奚若、许广平、楚图南、丁西林等。
    正在北京的杜波依斯博士的夫人歇莉·格雷姆，亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克，常设局成员国代表苏丹凯尔、日本西园寺公一、印度尼西亚阿费夫，亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉，在北京的国际组织和民族解放组织的代表，出席了纪念会。
    郭沫若同志在纪念会上讲话。他说，在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，美国被压迫黑人的斗争今天正在胜利前进，我们一定要继续发扬杜波依斯博士在反帝革命斗争中不屈不挠的精神，同美国黑人和一切被压迫民族、被压迫人民联合起来，消灭以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    郭沫若说，毛主席在一九六三年八月发表的《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》，像一盏光焰四射的明灯，为美国黑人和一切被压迫人民指出了解放的道路，为美国黑人提供了革命斗争的理论武器。这个伟大文献发表以后，美国黑人进一步觉醒，他们打碎了“非暴力主义”的枷锁，展开了蓬蓬勃勃的武装抗暴斗争。我们伟大领袖毛主席在声明中指出：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”毛主席的这个伟大预言，必将变为光辉的现实。
    杜波依斯夫人歇莉·格雷姆在讲话中介绍了杜波依斯的生平。她说，杜波依斯是个研究者、教学者、历史学家、社会学家、诗人，但他首先是一个革命者。歇莉·格雷姆回顾了杜波依斯和她访问中国时受到毛主席接见的情景。她说，杜波依斯在中国看到了东方升起的红太阳，在中国找到了真理，使他恢复了青春的活力，继续为革命进行不懈的斗争。
    歇莉·格雷姆说，在纪念杜波依斯诞生一百周年的日子里，我向美国黑人致敬，他们以“黑人暴力”为口号，正把美国的无产阶级群众运动推向革命的道路。她说，美国的侵略将由世界人民群众的觉醒而制止，帝国主义注定要死亡。
    歇莉·格雷姆说，今天，在毛泽东思想指引下的中国无产阶级文化大革命，把革命推向了人类历史上前所未有的高度。我们在中国无产阶级文化大革命进行期间纪念杜波依斯的诞生，使我感到欢欣鼓舞。歇莉·格雷姆在结束她的讲话时，满怀激情地朗诵了杜波依斯心爱的毛主席的词：“东方欲晓，莫道君行早。踏遍青山人未老，风景这边独好。……”
    森纳那亚克在讲话中谴责苏修及其追随者充当美帝国主义的帮凶，歪曲杜波依斯博士反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义以及各国反动派的战斗的政治立场，企图把杜波依斯描绘成一个消极的和平工作者，从而破坏美国的和其他被压迫人民的反帝革命斗争。他说，在这个时候，亚非作家常设局号召所有革命和进步的美国黑人以及其他人民，坚决地进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义、反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和一切反动派的斗争。
    杜波依斯对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱和他的战斗精神激动着每一个人，纪念会上的所有讲话都激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
