The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee recently held a work conference on promoting revolution and production in rural areas, summarizing the experiences of revolution and production over the past year and comprehensively deploying the tasks for 1968.

Attendees included leaders from various county (district) revolutionary committees, public security committees, and some brigade and production team leadership, as well as representatives from the People's Liberation Army's support-left and support-agriculture personnel, leaders from various levels of agricultural representative assemblies, and over 1,400 representatives from advanced collectives and individuals who have made achievements in promoting revolution and production. The representatives repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, as well as the New Year editorials from the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. The conference emphasized that all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must, in the new year, raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, strongly emphasize proletarian politics, and with the greatest determination and higher enthusiasm, better follow the great leader Chairman Mao and his great strategic deployment. They must take the study of Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental foundation of all work, the soul of the soul, the core of the core, and the focus of the focus. They must resolutely, thoroughly, swiftly, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights and seizing comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The conference pointed out that the spring plowing season is approaching. This year's spring plowing is coming under the call for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and is the first spring plowing production after the birth of the revolutionary committees. Doing a good job in spring plowing is of special importance for achieving a double victory in revolution and production this year and further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. All poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs should take a combative stance and quickly launch a spring plowing production campaign. Fire the first shot of spring plowing production!

Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Chairman Sheng Fuzhi attended the meeting and delivered an important speech. Deputy Chairmen Wu De, Fu Chongbi, Nie Yuanzi of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and responsible comrades from the Beijing Garrison, Huang Zuozhen and Liu Shaowen, also attended the meeting. Wu De, Huang Zuozhen, and Liu Shaowen made reports and speeches at the meeting.

The representatives unanimously agreed that "promoting revolution and production" is a great strategic policy of our great leader Chairman Mao and an important task for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must use revolution to drive production, starting from promoting the ideological transformation of the people, mobilizing all positive factors, and sparing no effort to do a good job in all production work and spring plowing production.

The representatives focused on studying the great leader Chairman Mao's series of brilliant expositions on emphasizing politics and the Party's political tasks in rural areas, exposing and criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen, who advocated "production first," implemented material incentives, and attempted to restore capitalism by inciting and utilizing spontaneous capitalist tendencies. The representatives solemnly pointed out: whether or not to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasize proletarian politics is a major issue of whether to follow the socialist road or the capitalist road, and whether or not to have the dictatorship of the proletariat. This major issue, which concerns the life and death of our Party and state, must be highly valued and deeply understood. Under no circumstances and at no time can we deviate from this.

The representatives of advanced collectives and individuals attending the meeting vividly explained with a large number of facts from their personal experiences that the higher the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is raised in a community, the better the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is carried out, the more proletarian politics are emphasized, the better the people's spiritual outlook, the higher the production enthusiasm, and the greater the change in production conditions. They said: emphasizing proletarian politics is not a temporary measure but a top priority to ensure that our country will never change color. The more work there is, the busier the farm work, and the greater the difficulties, the more we must emphasize proletarian politics and carry out the ideological transformation of the people. To do a good job in this year's spring plowing production, material preparations are indeed important, but what is more important is to always, everywhere, and in all matters emphasize Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics, and to focus on the ideological transformation of the people. Only in this way can we ensure that we will never deviate in the midst of a thousand busynesses.

The conference especially emphasized the need to, according to the characteristics of rural areas, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Various forms should be adopted to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, do a good job in the rectification of the unit, and launch a people's war to eliminate factionalism in the suburbs, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and further consolidating and developing the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution.

The conference demanded that every revolutionary cadre must strictly require themselves, study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, break down the "self" thoroughly, establish the "public," break down the "fear," and establish the "dare." They must closely rely on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, do a good job in the revolution and production of the suburbs, keep up with the rapidly developing revolutionary situation, lead and organize the masses to advance bravely under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The conference called on all poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," and vigorously launch the mass movement to learn from Dazhai. Learn from the experiences of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Dazhai in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly establish the idea of "farming for revolution," further carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, and promote the rapid development of suburban agriculture.

The conference, from beginning to end, raised the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasized proletarian politics. The representatives attending the conference were all full of fighting spirit, making plans and expressing their determination to bring the broad masses of farmers into the spring plowing production battle with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and achieve a bumper harvest in both revolution and production for the whole year.

    北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治同志出席了会议，并作了重要讲话。北京市革命委员会副主任委员吴德、傅崇碧、聂元梓，北京卫戍区负责人黄作珍、刘绍文等负责同志也出席了会议。吴德、黄作珍、刘绍文同志并在会上作了报告和讲话。
    出席会议的代表一致认为：“抓革命，促生产”，是我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略方针，也是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一项重要任务。我们一定要用革命带动生产，从促进人的思想革命化入手，调动一切积极因素，全力以赴，抓好各项生产工作，搞好春耕生产。
    代表们着重学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于突出政治和党在农村政治工作任务的一系列光辉论述，揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委以彭真为首的反革命修正主义集团鼓吹“生产第一”，大搞物质刺激，竭力诱发和利用自发的资本主义倾向，妄图复辟资本主义的罪行。代表们严肃地指出：是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出不突出无产阶级政治，是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大问题，是要不要无产阶级专政的大问题。对于这个关系到我们党和国家存亡的大是大非的问题，一定要高度重视，深刻理解，任何时候，任何情况下，不能转向。
    出席会议的先进集体代表和先进个人以他们亲身经历的大量事实，生动地说明了，那个社队毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高，文化大革命搞得好，突出了无产阶级政治，人的精神面貌就好，生产积极性就高，生产面貌变化就大。他们说：突出无产阶级政治，不是什么权宜之计，而是保证我们国家永不变色的头等大事。工作越多，农活越忙，困难越大，就越要突出无产阶级政治，越要搞好人的思想革命化。要搞好今年春耕生产，物质准备固然很重要，但是更重要的是时时事事处处突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓人的思想革命化，只有这样，才能保证在千忙万忙之中永不转向。
    会议特别强调，要根据农村特点，以“斗私，批修”为纲，办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。要采取多种形式，结合各项任务，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位斗批改，并在郊区开展一场围剿派性的人民战争，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    会议要求每个革命的领导干部都必须更加严格地要求自己，学好用好毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大破“怕”字，大立“敢”字，紧紧地依靠广大贫下中农，搞好郊区的革命和生产，不断跟上迅速发展的革命形势，领导和组织群众，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，奋勇前进。
    会议号召全郊区贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，坚决响应毛主席发出的“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，大力开展学大寨的群众运动。学习大寨贫下中农和革命干部活学活用毛主席著作的经验，牢固地树立“为革命种田”的思想，进一步发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，促进郊区农业生产迅速发展。
    会议自始至终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治。参加会议的代表，个个斗志昂扬，纷纷订措施，表决心，表示要以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，带动广大农民迅速投入春耕生产战斗，夺取全年革命、生产双丰收。
