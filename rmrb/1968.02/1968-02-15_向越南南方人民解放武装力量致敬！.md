On the seventh anniversary of the unification of the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam, news of the heroic victories of the South Vietnamese military and people in the New Year's offensive has spread from the banks of the Bach Dang River to the Cape of Ca Mau. We warmly celebrate the glorious festival of the people of South Vietnam and enthusiastically hail the great victories of the South Vietnamese military and people!

Seven years ago, in the revolutionary flames of the struggle against American imperialism for national liberation, the self-defense forces and guerrilla units of the South Vietnamese people, under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, united to form the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam. Over the past seven years, they have rapidly grown and strengthened in their battles against the most vicious enemy of the world's people, American imperialism, and its lackeys. This people's army has galloped across the battlefields of South Vietnam, achieving one brilliant victory after another. The past seven years have been seven years of the people of South Vietnam singing the song of victory in people's war, seven years of the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam growing from weakness to strength, from small to large, and continuously developing and growing stronger, dealing heavy blows to the American imperialists and their lackeys.

The armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam have established a vast liberated area in South Vietnam, covering more than four-fifths of the land and more than two-thirds of the population. They have annihilated and disintegrated nearly 1.5 million enemy troops; shot down and destroyed 8,590 enemy aircraft; destroyed 15,800 enemy vehicles; and sunk 463 enemy ships and boats. The armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam have fully demonstrated the power of people's war, using flexible strategies and tactics, firmly grasping the initiative on the battlefield. The recent New Year's offensive has further proven the invincible power of people's war and the unprecedented strength of the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Without a people's army, people have nothing." This is a great and unshakable truth.

All oppressed nations and peoples who seek liberation must organize their own new-type people's army to wage a long and arduous struggle against imperialism and its lackeys, to thoroughly overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and its lackeys. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, after long years of struggle, has created a new socialist China. Now, the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam are similarly the reliable guarantee for the people of South Vietnam to achieve liberation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "This army is powerful because all those who join it have a conscious discipline; they are not fighting for the private interests of a few or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the whole nation, and they are united and fighting for these interests."

The armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam are such a new-type people's army. It has a flesh-and-blood connection with the people, enjoys the enthusiastic support of the people, has conscious discipline, and is united with the people. It firmly relies on the masses and fully mobilizes the masses. This people's army is completely dedicated to the interests of the broad masses of the people of South Vietnam and is the children of the people of South Vietnam. This is the fundamental reason why this people's army is powerful.

The armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam are such a new-type people's army. It possesses an indomitable spirit, determined to overcome all enemies and never to be subdued by them. This people's army has displayed great revolutionary heroism. The soldiers of the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam are all heroes who kill enemies. They fight bravely, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, fighting continuously; they dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through fires, daring to engage in hand-to-hand combat, fighting fiercely; they have beaten the most vicious imperialist—the American aggressors—into a state of chaos and defeat. The heroic people of South Vietnam and this heroic people's army have raised the level of people's war to a new height, writing a brilliant new chapter in the history of the world's revolutionary wars.

Comrades and brothers in the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam! The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with comradely and fraternal feelings, extend to you the warmest and highest combat salute, and sincerely learn from your high level of revolutionary heroism.

Comrades and brothers in the armed forces of the people's liberation of South Vietnam! The Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by our great commander Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, together with 700 million Chinese people, will surely be your strong rear guard, resolutely unite with you, fight with you, and achieve victory with you!

The Vietnamese people will surely win! The American imperialists will surely be defeated!

    向越南南方人民解放武装力量致敬！
    中国人民解放军空直机关无产阶级革命派
    在越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年之际，从边海河南岸到金瓯角，传来了英雄的越南南方军民新春大捷的喜讯。我们热烈庆祝越南南方人民的光辉节日，热烈欢呼越南南方军民的伟大胜利！
    七年前，在抗美救国斗争的革命烈火中诞生的自卫队和游击队等越南南方人民革命武装队伍，在越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下，统一组成越南南方人民解放武装力量。七年来，他们在同全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗的战斗中迅速成长壮大。这一支人民军队，在南越战场上纵横驰骋，南征北战，获得了一个又一个辉煌的胜利。过去的七年，是越南南方人民高奏人民战争凯歌的七年，是越南南方人民解放武装力量由弱到强、由小到大，不断发展壮大，沉重打击美帝及其走狗的七年。
    越南南方人民解放武装力量在越南南方已经建立起一个占五分之四以上土地和三分之二以上人口的广大解放区，消灭和瓦解敌军近一百五十万名；击落、击毁敌机八千五百九十架；击毁敌人军车一万五千八百多辆；击沉敌船艇四百六十三艘。越南南方人民解放武装力量极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，运用了机动灵活的战略战术，紧紧地掌握了战场主动权。最近的新春大捷，更进一步证明了人民战争的无比威力，证明了越南南方人民解放武装力量的空前强大。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”这是一个颠扑不破的伟大的真理。
    一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民要争取解放，就得组织起自己的新型的人民军队，同帝国主义及其走狗进行长期的、艰巨的战斗，彻底推翻帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治。在我们伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，中国人民解放军经过长期的战斗，打出了一个崭新的社会主义中国。现在，越南南方人民解放武装力量，同样是越南南方人民争取解放的可靠保证。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。”
    越南南方人民解放武装力量，就是这样一支新型的人民军队，它同人民群众有着血肉的联系，得到人民群众的热烈支持；它具有自觉的纪律，同人民群众打成一片；它坚定地依靠群众，充分地发动群众。这支人民军队完全是为着越南南方广大人民的利益服务的，是越南南方人民的子弟兵。这就是这支人民军队所以有力量的根本原因。
    越南南方人民解放武装力量，是这样一支新型的人民军队，它具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。这支人民军队发扬了大无畏的革命英雄主义精神。越南南方人民解放武装力量的战士，个个是杀敌英雄，他们英勇战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳，连续作战；他们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，敢于刺刀见红，猛打猛冲；他们把世界上最凶恶的帝国主义——美国侵略强盗打得人仰马翻，落花流水。英雄的越南南方人民和这支英雄的人民军队，把人民战争发展到了一个高度水平，在世界人民革命战争史上写下了光辉灿烂的新的篇章。
    越南南方人民解放武装力量的战友们！我们中国人民解放军的指战员怀着同志和兄弟的感情，向你们致以最热烈、最崇高的战斗敬礼，并热诚地学习你们这种高度的革命英雄主义的精神。
    越南南方人民解放武装力量的战友们！我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，同七亿中国人民一起，誓作你们的坚强后盾，坚决和你们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    越南人民必胜！美帝必败！
