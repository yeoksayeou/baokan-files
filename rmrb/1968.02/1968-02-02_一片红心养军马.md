A certain military horse farm worker, seventy-three years old, wrote:

The essence of Liu Shaoqi's thinking is self-interest. He said: "Don't be afraid of losing out, don't be afraid of blood and sweat," and if you persist in this way, you will become a "team leader," a "secretary," and so on. I heard this and it made my lungs burst with anger!

A Communist Party member does not seek official positions but seeks revolution. After joining the Party, I served as the director of a cooperative, the deputy director of a factory, and later became a horse herder. This is a need of the revolution, and whatever the revolution needs, I will do it and do it well. Being a horse herder is to raise horses for the revolution. One horse is like one gun, one cannon. I always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. We have few people and many horses, and there are many difficulties. We do not distinguish between day and night to deliver grass and feed to the horses. I am not afraid of strong winds and heavy snow, carrying load after load. My body is sweating, and my outer clothes are frozen and cracking, my limbs are numb, and sometimes I roll into the snow with the grass, but I get up and continue to work. In harsh weather conditions, we eat and sleep on the mountain. I have arthritis and dacryocystitis, but I do not think about these things at all. I think of taking Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune as examples, and for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, I will devote my red heart to raising military horses.

Chairman Mao teaches us that a Communist Party member should "take the revolutionary cause as the first priority." Chairman Mao's every teaching and every instruction is based on the interests of the revolution and the people. Therefore, my first priority is to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. If Chairman Mao tells me to farm, I will pick up the hoe without hesitation. If Chairman Mao tells me to raise military horses, I will devote my life to the revolution, swinging the whip.

Liu Shaoqi wants us to suffer for personal gain, to become "team leaders" and "secretaries." I will not do this. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution, study and apply the "Three Articles" diligently, thoroughly transform my worldview, and devote everything to raising horses.

    一片红心养军马
    某军马场牧工　七十三
    中国赫鲁晓夫的葫芦里装的就是一个“私”字。他说：“不怕吃亏，不怕流血流汗”，这样长期下去就会当上“队长”、
  “书记”等等。我一听，肺都气炸了！
    共产党员不是要做官，而是要革命。我入党后，当过合作社主任，工厂副厂长，后来又当牧工。这是革命的需要，凡是革命需要的我就干，干就干好。当牧工，是为革命养马，一匹马就是一杆枪、一门炮。我牢记毛主席的教导：“完全”“彻底”为人民服务。我们人少马多，困难很大，我们就不分昼夜地给马送草送料。我不怕风大雪大，背了一趟又一趟。身上淌着汗，外面衣服冻得嘎嘎直响，四肢冻得麻木，有时连人带草滚到雪地里，但我爬起来继续干。在恶劣的气候条件下，我们吃在山上，睡在山上。我有关节炎、泪囊炎的毛病，但是我根本不想这些。我想的是以张思德、白求恩为榜样，为中国革命和世界革命，掏尽红心养好军马。
    毛主席教导我们，共产党员要“以革命利益为第一生命”。毛主席的每一个教导，每一个指示，都是从革命的利益、人民的利益出发的。所以，我的第一生命，也就是执行毛主席的指示。毛主席叫我去种地，我扛起锄头不迟疑，毛主席叫我养军马，我为革命甩一辈子马鞭子。
    中国赫鲁晓夫要我们为了私利，为了当“队长”、“书记”去吃苦，我坚决不干。我一定跟着毛主席革命到底，狠学狠用“老三篇”，彻底改造世界观，为养马献出自己的一切。
