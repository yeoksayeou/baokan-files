In the face of the heavy blows dealt by the Vietnamese people's New Year Offensive, U Thant, the UN Secretary-General, recently visited India for three days, once again collaborating with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to promote the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" conspiracy.

According to a report from New Delhi by Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, when the heroic people of South Vietnam launched their New Year Offensive, achieving stunning victories that shocked the world, and the U.S. aggressors suffered a humiliating defeat, U Thant, who has always been a loyal servant of the U.S. policy in Vietnam, held a series of secret talks with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as soon as he arrived in New Delhi on the 8th. According to an Indian official spokesman, these two accomplices of the U.S. imperialists spent most of their time discussing the Vietnam issue. "India agrees with U Thant's general attitude towards the Vietnam issue: various methods can be tried to move this issue from the battlefield to the negotiating table." On the 10th, U Thant also held a secret meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to India, Bowles. An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman revealed that U Thant is engaged in "very delicate work" to find a way out for the U.S. imperialists.

U Thant's activities in India are entirely in accordance with the wishes of the U.S. imperialists and are part of the current efforts by the U.S. and its accomplices to push a new "peace talks" conspiracy. Recently, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, in order to help the U.S. get out of its predicament and sabotage the Vietnamese people's victorious struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, have launched a new wave of "peace talks" deception. Before U Thant's visit to India, Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin personally went to India to conspire with the Indian reactionaries and the Yugoslav traitor group led by Tito, who was active in India, on the "peace talks" for Vietnam. On the same day U Thant arrived in India, British Prime Minister Wilson held a secret meeting with U.S. President Johnson in the U.S., with one of the main topics being the "peace talks" issue. At the same time, other lackeys of the U.S. imperialists are also busy with this.

In the face of the increasingly powerful Vietnamese people, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys' attempt to push a new "peace talks" deception, aiming to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms, is doomed to fail. The recent powerful offensive by the people of South Vietnam not only dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism but also gave a resounding slap to the lackeys who have been serving the U.S. "peace talks" conspiracy. The arrogant activities of the U.S. lackeys will only make them suffer a bloody defeat.

U Thant left New Delhi on the 11th and will continue his activities in Moscow and London.

    在美帝遭到南越军民新春攻势沉重打击下
    吴丹去印度活动妄图掀起新的“和谈”妖风
    据新华社十一日讯  新德里消息：在英雄的越南南方军民发动的新春攻势取得震惊世界的辉煌战果，美国强盗遭到惨重失败的时候，一贯为美帝侵越政策奔走效劳的联合国秘书长吴丹最近跑到印度活动了三天，再次伙同印度总理英迪拉·甘地为美帝推行“和谈”阴谋。
    吴丹在八日一到新德里，就和印度总理英迪拉·甘地举行一系列的秘密会谈，据印度官方发言人透露，这两个美帝帮凶在会谈中“用大部分时间讨论了越南问题”，“印度同意吴丹对越南问题的总的态度：可以试行各种办法以便把这个问题从战场搬到会议桌上。”吴丹在十日又和美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯进行秘密会谈。印度外交部发言人透露，吴丹正在从事为美帝“寻找摆脱困境的办法的很微妙的工作。”
    吴丹到印度活动，完全是按着美帝的意旨行事的，是目前美帝和它的帮凶们紧张地推行“和谈”新阴谋的一个组成部分。最近美帝及其帮凶走卒为了使美帝摆脱困境，破坏越南人民正在取得节节胜利的抗美救国斗争，正在掀起一股新的“和谈”妖风。在吴丹到印度前不几天，苏修头目柯西金，亲自到印度同印度反动派和正在印度活动的南斯拉夫叛徒集团头子铁托密谋越南“和谈”等问题。在吴丹到达印度的同一天，英国首相威尔逊在美国和美帝头子约翰逊进行秘密会谈，其中心内容之一，也是“和谈”问题。与此同时，美帝的其他一些帮凶走卒也在为此四出活动。
    在越战越强的越南人民面前，美帝及其帮凶走卒企图推行新的“和谈”骗局，使越南人民放下武器的阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。越南南方军民最近的强大攻势，不仅沉重地打击了美帝国主义，而且也给了为美帝“和谈”阴谋效劳的帮凶走卒们以响亮的耳光。美帝帮凶们的猖狂活动，只能使他们自己碰得头破血流。
    吴丹已经在十一日离开新德里，他还要到莫斯科和伦敦等地活动。
