The armed forces of the people's liberation in South Vietnam have recently launched fierce offensives against the U.S. aggressors on various battlefields in South Vietnam and have carried out powerful attacks on the U.S. and puppet nests in Saigon. The U.S. imperialists are crying in pain, and the U.S. head Johnson, along with the main officials of the U.S. government and the two-party politicians in Congress, are like ants on a hot pan, anxious and unable to settle down.

According to reports from Western newspapers and news agencies, after receiving the news that the U.S. "embassy" in Saigon was attacked, Johnson has already spent two sleepless nights. To plot countermeasures, Johnson has "reduced formal appointments to the smallest extent permitted by etiquette," while maintaining a "feverish pace of work" regarding the situation in South Vietnam. Within eight hours of the start of the attack on the U.S. "embassy," he received about twenty-five urgent telegrams from Saigon. Many times, he couldn't wait for the telegrams to be delivered from the White House communications center to his office, so he hurriedly called the center to inquire about the situation.

The news says that the offensive by the armed forces of South Vietnam has caused "deep unease" in Washington. U.S. high-ranking officials are "shocked" by the extensive scope of the offensive and the wide front of the attacks. White House spokesman Christian exclaimed that the attack on the U.S. "embassy" is "a rather serious incident."

Johnson has been holding frequent meetings with military and political leaders such as Secretary of State Rusk in a state of panic, plotting new steps of aggression. After the meeting on January 31, White House spokesman Christian claimed that Johnson discussed "further measures" to escalate the war in Vietnam with these military and political leaders, and he also demanded support from both parties for "any action that may be necessary."

The broad and powerful attacks by the armed forces of South Vietnam against the U.S. aggressors and the sudden raids on the U.S. "embassy" and the puppet "presidential palace" have once again thoroughly exposed the true nature of the U.S. imperialist paper tiger. American bourgeois newspapers, in commenting on the offensive by the people of South Vietnam, lamented that the U.S. imperialists are completely in a passive and defensive position on the battlefield in Vietnam, while having to admit the powerful might of the armed forces of the people's liberation in South Vietnam. A report by the New York Times correspondent in Saigon admitted that the combat activities of the people's armed forces demonstrated their strong offensive power in this war. The Christian Science Monitor despondently pointed out that in South Vietnam, there is no safe shelter for Americans, and the attack on the U.S. "embassy" is a heavy blow to the United States.

The Washington Star and the Washington Daily News complained: These attacks are equivalent to "the humiliation suffered by the United States and the Saigon government," and the United States should not "tragically underestimate the strength and capabilities of the enemy"; "We have 500,000 men on the (South Vietnamese) battlefield, and just two months ago, our high-ranking officials who flew back from Saigon to report said the situation was favorable. Should we suffer such a defeat at this time?" "In fact, intelligence and defense are both terrible."

French and British bourgeois newspapers, in commenting on the recent powerful offensive by the armed forces of South Vietnam, ridiculed the plight of the United States on the battlefield in Vietnam and mocked the various "myths" it had spread about the war in Vietnam. The French newspaper Le Monde, in an editorial titled "Myths Shattered," said: "The Americans not only failed to prevent the National Liberation Front from attacking Saigon and several major cities in Vietnam, but even the most important U.S. base in South Vietnam was not spared."

The British Times pointed out that the "ferocity and coordination" of the offensive by the Vietnamese military and people "obviously surprised" the U.S. military commanders.

    奇兵天降征腐恶  猛袭敌巢逞英豪
    南越军民打得美帝惊恐万状叫苦连天
    约翰逊急得彻夜不眠  华盛顿连日一片混乱
    据新华社一日讯　华盛顿消息：越南南方人民解放武装力量最近在南越各地战场上对美国侵略军发动的凌厉攻势和对西贡美伪巢穴的猛烈袭击，打得美帝国主义叫苦连天，美帝头子约翰逊以及美国政府主要官员和国会里的两党政客，如热锅上的蚂蚁，惶惶不可终日。
    据西方报刊和通讯社报道，在接到西贡美国“大使馆”被袭击的消息之后，约翰逊已经度过了两个不眠之夜，为了策划进行挣扎的阴谋，约翰逊“把正式约会减少到礼仪所许可的最小限度”，而就南越局势“保持着一种狂热的工作步调”。他在美国“大使馆”开始受袭击后的八小时内，就接到了来自西贡的约二十五封告急电报，有好多次他等不及电报从白宫的通讯中心送到他的办公室去，就急忙打电话给这个中心询问情况。
    消息说，越南南方人民武装的攻势在华盛顿“使人们感到深切不安”，美帝高级官员对发动攻势的范围之大和发动袭击的战线之宽“感到吃惊”。白宫发言人克里斯琴惊呼：美国“大使馆”被袭击“是一个相当严重的事件”。
    约翰逊连日来在一片惊慌中同国务卿腊斯克等军政头目频繁举行会议，策划新的侵略步骤。在一月三十一日的会议后，白宫发言人克里斯琴声称：约翰逊同这些军政头目们讨论了扩大侵越战争的“进一步措施”，他还要求两党支持“可能需要采取的任何行动”。
    越南南方人民武装对美国侵略军发动的广泛而又强大的攻击和对美国“大使馆”和伪“总统府”的突袭，再一次彻底戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎的原形。美国资产阶级报纸在评论越南南方军民的攻势时，哀叹美帝国主义在越南战场上完全处于被动挨打的地位，同时不得不承认越南南方人民解放武装力量的强大威力。《纽约时报》驻西贡记者的报道承认，人民武装的作战活动显示了他们在这场战争中强大的进攻力量。《基督教科学箴言报》沮丧地指出，在南越对美国人来说没有任何庇护所是安全的，对美国“大使馆”的进攻是对美国的沉重打击。
    《华盛顿明星晚报》和《华盛顿每日新闻》抱怨说：这些袭击等于是“使美国和西贡政府蒙受的屈辱”，美国不应该对“敌人的力量和能力可悲地作出过低的估计”；“我们在（南越）战场上有五十万人，就在两个月以前从西贡飞回来作报告的我们的高级官员们还告诉我们说情况顺利，在这个时候我们难道应该吃这种败仗吗？”“事实上，情报和防务都很糟糕。”
    法国和英国的资产阶级报刊在评论越南南方人民武装最近的强大攻势时纷纷奚落美国在越南战场上的狼狈处境，并嘲笑它就侵越战争散布的种种“神话”已经破产。法国《世界报》在题为《神话破产》的社论中说：“美国人不仅未能阻止民族解放阵线攻击西贡和好几个越南的大城市，而且连美国在南越的最重要的基地也未能幸免”。
    英国《泰晤士报》指出，越南军民的“攻势之猛和配合之好显然使（美国）军事司令们感到惊讶”。
