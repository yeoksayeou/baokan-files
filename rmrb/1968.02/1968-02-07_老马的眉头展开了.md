	Old Ma's forehead unfurrowed. In recent days, Ma Mingqian, the political leader and production group leader of the Eighth Brigade of Yong'an Production Team, had been frowning all the time. Everyone guessed that he must have encountered some difficulty.

	It turned out that the Eighth Brigade had a bumper harvest, and the masses of commune members decided to deliver 240,000 jin of public and surplus grain to the state. The golden grain was piled up all over the courtyard, but the brigade had only about 30 sacks, and even if all of them were used, only a few thousand jin could be transported each day. Old Ma had been worried all along, fearing that the weather might change, and the grain would get damp, making it difficult to store in the granary.

	The study class began, and although Ma Mingqian was in the study class, his mind was always on the sack problem. The propaganda team saw him frowning and talked to him. Old Ma poured out all his difficulties. The propaganda team members studied Chairman Mao's teachings with him word by word: "The people have limitless creative power." "All correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." They earnestly told him: "Even the most capable fish will die if it leaves the water. A cadre who wants to be a leader of the masses must learn to follow the mass line and rely on the masses in everything!"

	After studying, although Ma Mingqian's thinking had opened up a bit, he still felt that the lack of sacks in the brigade was a practical problem. No matter what, the masses couldn't carry the grain to the state with their hands! Following the principle of learning, practicing, and recognizing, the propaganda team members let him go back to the brigade and discuss with the commune members according to Chairman Mao's teachings on going to the masses and learning from the masses.

	At the commune members' meeting, Old Ma first led everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and talked about the great significance of delivering grain early and delivering good grain. Then he laid out the brigade's actual problems and asked everyone to come up with ideas and solutions. As soon as he finished speaking, everyone started shouting: Chairman Mao cares a lot about grain, we have to make him feel at ease. We have to deliver the best grain to the state as quickly as possible. When it came to the lack of sacks, one said, "I have a sack at home," another said, "I have a cloth bag..." Saying this, everyone went home and dug out all the sacks and bags that could hold grain. In just over ten minutes, everyone brought out more than 30 sacks and cloth bags. Seeing this pile of sacks, Old Ma's heart was filled with joy. As a result, it only took eight days to transport all 240,000 jin of grain to the granary.

	This incident unfurrowed Old Ma's forehead. At the study class's experience-sharing meeting, he said with deep feeling: "As long as you rely on the masses, there is no difficulty in the world. A person, no matter how strong, can only drive a few nails. A cadre who leaves the masses can accomplish nothing."

    老马的眉头展开了
    这几天，永安大队八队政治队长兼生产领导小组长马明谦的眉毛又成天锁个疙瘩。大家猜他准是又遇上了什么难题。
    原来，八队夺得了大丰收，广大社员决心要向国家交售二十四万斤公粮和余粮。金灿灿的粮食堆得满场院都是，可是队里只有三十来条麻袋，全部用上，每天也只能运几千斤。老马一直在担心，唯恐天变脸，粮食一受潮，粮库就不好保管了。
    学习班开课了，马明谦虽然身在学习班，心里可整天在想着麻袋的事。宣传队的同志见他锁眉皱脸的，就找他谈心。老马把自己的难处一古脑儿都倒了出来。宣传队的同志就和他一字一句地学习毛主席的教导：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”“凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”恳切地对他说：鱼再有能耐，离开水也得干死。干部要当群众的带头人，就要学会走群众路线，事事要依靠群众才行呀！经过学习，马明谦的思想虽然开了点窍，但总觉得队里没麻袋是实际问题，不管怎么说，群众也不能用手捧着把粮食送去啊！本着边学习、边实践、边认识的原则，宣传队的同志让他按照毛主席关于到群众中间去，向群众学习的教导，回队里和社员商量商量。
    在社员大会上，老马先领着大家学习了毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，讲了早交粮、交好粮的重大意义，然后把队里的实际问题摆了摆，要大家出主意想办法。他话音刚落，大家就嚷开了：毛主席很关心粮食，要让他老人家放得下心才行。咱要以最快的速度，把最好的粮食交售给国家。说到缺麻袋，这个说，俺家有一条麻袋，那个说，俺家有一条布袋……说着，大家回家，把凡是能装粮食的袋子都翻腾出来了。十多分钟工夫大家就拿出来三十多条麻袋和布袋。看着这一堆袋子，老马心里那股高兴劲就甭提了。结果，只用了八天时间，二十四万斤粮食就全部运到了粮库。
    这件事，解开了老马眉头上的愁疙瘩。他在学习班的讲用会上深有体会地说：“只要靠群众，世上无难事。一个人浑身是铁，又能打几个钉？当干部离开了群众，什么事也办不成。”
