Everywhere on the battlefield in South Vietnam, the American aggressors have been trapped in a net. In recent days, the armed forces of the people's liberation in South Vietnam have not only fiercely attacked enemy strongholds and facilities along the demilitarized zone and Route 9, but have also frequently struck the enemy in various battlefields in Saigon and other areas, achieving new victories.

Since the 21st, the people's liberation armed forces have been active in the city and suburbs of Saigon and the surrounding areas of Saigon, not only attacking the enemy everywhere in a mysterious and elusive manner, but also continuously and fiercely attacking the enemy's important bases and facilities. On the morning of the 21st, the people's liberation armed forces once again shelled the enemy's New Mountain One base. On the morning of the 22nd, the people's liberation armed forces captured a pseudo-police station in the suburbs of Saigon. On the same day, the people's liberation armed forces also destroyed an enemy ship fleet on a river near Saigon, with ten tugboats and barges all sunk and damaged. On the morning of the 23rd, the people's liberation armed forces shelled the Phu Linh radar station near the New Mountain One base and also shelled the U.S. 25th Infantry Division base near Saigon's Go Vap twice.

On the 24th, the people's liberation armed forces again heavily shelled the New Mountain One base and the "General Staff" of the puppet army. At the New Mountain One base, the artillery of the people's liberation armed forces hit several enemy aircraft and seven buildings, with three U.S. military barracks severely damaged. Some American aggressors who were sleeping were killed, and many U.S. soldiers were injured, causing them to hide under their beds in a state of utter chaos. On the 25th, the people's liberation armed forces also launched a surprise attack on a base of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division located about 60 kilometers southwest of Saigon. According to preliminary reports, nearly 100 enemy troops were annihilated, 15 military vehicles were destroyed, and a 155mm cannon was captured. On the same day, the people's liberation armed forces also attacked two U.S. ships on the Saigon River.

On the night of the 24th and the early morning of the 25th, the people's liberation armed forces again heavily shelled the U.S. air base and helicopter base in Da Nang, destroying and damaging at least a dozen enemy aircraft.

Victorious reports from various provinces in the Mekong Delta have also been continuously coming in. From the 14th to the 17th, the people's liberation armed forces in Kien Giang Province repeatedly repulsed enemy counterattacks and once again attacked the enemy's Loc Ninh and Tan Son Nhut airfields, annihilating more than 600 enemy troops, including more than 200 American aggressors and mercenaries, destroying 40 enemy aircraft of various types, burning down three oil depots and ammunition depots, leveling two strongholds, and capturing a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

On the night of the 17th, the people's liberation armed forces in Vinh Long Province fought a battle against a U.S. ship fleet on the Co Chien River, annihilating more than 600 American aggressors, including many artillerymen and technicians.

On the 18th and 19th, the military and people of My Tho Province annihilated nearly 500 U.S. and puppet troops in My Tho City, captured a police outpost, destroyed the city's power plant and many enemy facilities.

From the night of the 17th to the 19th, the military and people of Ben Tre Province continuously attacked the enemy in Tra Vinh City for three days, annihilating nearly 200 enemy troops and destroying many enemy warehouses.
