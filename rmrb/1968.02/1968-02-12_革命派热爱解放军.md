	Revolutionary Factions Love the PLA

	"Fish need water, trees need roots, the people and the army are forever heart to heart. The PLA loves the revolutionary factions, and the revolutionary factions love the PLA even more."

	On the morning of November 17, 1967, at around 10:00 AM, soldier Zhang Jinchang of the 7th Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Heilongjiang Province was injured on duty and needed to be rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. This company had just arrived in the forest area to carry out a mission. The place where the soldier was injured was over a hundred miles from the nearest Meixi Hospital, and transportation was inconvenient. The small train on the forest railway runs every other day, and unfortunately, this day happened to be an odd day. Everyone was very anxious.

	The workers of the forest railway transport team, with their love for the PLA, all expressed: We must send this injured PLA comrade to the hospital as quickly as possible. The workers broke the rules, saying do it and doing it. In an instant, a small train loaded with this injured PLA comrade and the deep affection of the entire forest railway transport team revolutionaries sped towards Meixi Hospital.

	The entire staff of the hospital, who were studying at the time, immediately started preparing to rescue their comrade after hearing the news. At 6:30 PM, Zhang Jinchang was safely sent to the hospital, and a battle to rescue the injured PLA comrade began.

	The patient, due to a fractured skull and prolonged injury time, stopped breathing twice shortly after arriving at the hospital, and his blood pressure dropped significantly, putting his life in extreme danger. He needed oxygen and a blood transfusion before surgery. The Meixi Revolutionary Committee immediately broadcasted an urgent call to the entire district for people to donate blood to the PLA comrade.

	In the struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the proletarian revolutionary factions, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres of the Meixi area, who had established a deep combat friendship with the PLA, all rushed over upon hearing that the PLA comrade needed a blood transfusion. In an instant, the blood donation room was filled with people inside and out. Among them were white-haired elderly people, Red Guard youths, workers, peasants, soldiers from other units, and revolutionary cadres.

	"All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." The voices reading Chairman Mao's quotations echoed inside and outside the blood donation room. Everyone eagerly said, "Transfuse mine first! Transfuse mine first!"

	A PLA comrade was rolling up his sleeves to donate blood to his comrade when a Red Guard youth who had pushed his way through the crowd stopped him. The youth, sweating profusely, firmly said, "The PLA comrade's blood cannot be transfused; they need to defend the country. Transfuse mine!" Saying this, he rolled up his sleeve very high. A cadre from the Meixi Forestry Bureau Service Department, with his arm extended, repeatedly begged the head nurse, "Transfuse mine! I am healthy. Go ahead! We are all willing to mix our blood with the PLA comrade's blood."

	The hot blood flowed into the injured PLA comrade's body, and soon, good news came from the resuscitation room: "Zhang Jinchang's blood pressure has risen."

	However, for the medical staff of Meixi Hospital, this was only the beginning of the rescue. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, with the revolutionary spirit of serving the people thoroughly and completely, and continued to fight. The head nurse stood by the patient's side for several nights and days, carefully observing every change after the surgery. The chief of surgery took on the duties of a nurse, busying himself by the patient's side all night. Under the careful care of the medical staff, Zhang Jinchang, who had been unconscious for three days, finally opened his eyes. He saw the portrait of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and softly and affectionately called out, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao..." His voice expressed the common feelings of love for Chairman Mao.

	The party committee of the unit to which Zhang Jinchang belongs, upon hearing of the moving deeds of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Meixi area who are loyal to Chairman Mao and love the PLA, rushed to express their gratitude and sent people to present badges of Chairman Mao made by the soldiers, to express the boundless love for Chairman Mao, the boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, and the determination to march forward shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

    革命派热爱解放军
    “鱼靠水，树靠根，军民永远心连心，解放军热爱革命派，革命派更爱解放军。”
    一九六七年十一月十七日上午十点多钟，中国人民解放军黑龙江省驻军某部七连战士张金仓，因公负伤，需要马上送往医院进行抢救。这个连队是刚刚到林区执行任务的。战士负伤的地方离最近的美溪医院有一百多里，交通不便。森林铁路的小火车，每逢双日开一趟，偏偏这天正赶上单日，同志们都十分着急。
    森林铁路运输队的工人们怀着对解放军的热爱，纷纷表示：一定把这位负伤的解放军同志用最快的速度送到医院，工人们打破常规，说干就干。霎时，一辆载着这位负伤的解放军同志和森林铁路运输队全体革命工人的深情厚谊的小火车，飞一般地朝着美溪医院开去。
    正在学习的医院全体职工，听到消息以后，立即投入了抢救亲人的准备工作。下午六时三十分，张金仓被安全地送到医院，一场抢救负伤的解放军同志的战斗开始了。
    伤员由于脑顶骨折，加上受伤时间过长，到医院不久就两次停止呼吸，血压大幅度下降，生命处在万分危急之中，需要立即给氧和输血后才能进行手术。美溪革委会马上在广播里向全区人民发出了给解放军同志献血的紧急号召。
    在向党内一小撮走资派夺权的共同斗争中，同解放军建立了深厚战斗友谊的美溪地区的无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将和革命干部，听说解放军同志需要输血，都纷纷赶来。顿时，给解放军献血的人群挤满了输血室的里里外外。他们中间有白发苍苍的老人，有红卫兵小将，有工人、农民，有兄弟部队的解放军，有革命干部。
    “一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”输血室内外，朗读毛主席语录的声音此起彼伏。大家争先恐后地说：“先输我的！先输我的！”
    一位解放军同志正卷起袖子要给战友献血，突然被一名硬是从人堆里挤出来的红卫兵小将拦住了，只见他满头大汗，坚定地说：“解放军同志的血不准输，他们要保卫国防，输我的！”说着，他把衣袖挽得老高老高。美溪林业局服务科的一名干部，伸着胳膊向护士长再三恳求说：“输我的吧！我身体好，你输吧！我们都愿意把血和解放军同志的血溶合在一起。”
    热血流进负伤的解放军同志身上，很快，抢救室里就传出了“张金仓血压回升”的好消息。
    可是，对于美溪医院的医务人员来说，这仅仅是抢救的开始。他们反复学习了毛主席的教导，以“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的革命精神，继续投入战斗。护士长一连几昼夜地守在伤员面前，细心地观察着手术后的每一个变化。外科主任主动承担了护理员的工作，整夜整夜地忙碌在伤员的身旁。在医护人员的精心护理下，昏迷了三天的张金仓终于睁开了眼睛。他看到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的像，小声地、亲切地喊着：“毛主席，毛主席……”他的声音，表达了人们对毛主席无限热爱的共同感情。
    张金仓所在部队的党委，听到美溪地区无产阶级革命派无限忠于毛主席，热爱解放军，抢救张金仓的动人事迹后，怀着感激的心情，千里迢迢，特意派人前来致谢，并送来了战士们自制的毛主席像章，以表示军民无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛主席，肩并肩，心连心，决心沿着毛主席指引的方向一齐奋勇前进！（据新华社讯）
