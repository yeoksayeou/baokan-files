With the close cooperation of the broad masses of the people, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam continues to fight bravely and annihilates the enemy. In the face of the powerful and fierce offensive of the military and people of South Vietnam, the U.S.-puppet clique is in a state of chaos and at a loss for a response.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, February 4th – The armed forces of the people's liberation in South Vietnam, with the close cooperation of the broad masses of the people, have displayed a spirit of bravery and tenacity, pressing forward and annihilating the enemy. The people's liberation armed forces, which have already taken control of many large cities, continue to pursue and annihilate the enemy within these cities, striking back at the enemy's counterattacks. Between the 2nd and 3rd of this month, the people's liberation armed forces launched attacks on dozens of enemy-occupied towns and cities, and carried out fierce artillery bombardments in the southern part of the demilitarized zone. In the face of the powerful and fierce offensive of the people's liberation armed forces, the U.S.-puppet clique is in a state of chaos and at a loss for a response. Western news agencies have acknowledged that the fierce battles of these days "have shaken this country (the puppet government of South Vietnam) more than anything else in twenty years of war."

The liberation forces that have entered the U.S.-puppet stronghold of Saigon have, after four days of fierce street battles, dealt a heavy blow to the enemy. By the evening of the 3rd, they still occupied some areas of the city. On the morning and afternoon of the 4th, the liberation forces launched an attack on the enemy near Go Dau, about ten kilometers northeast of the city, and raided a U.S. military warehouse in the Dinh Tuong area, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The liberation forces also used rocket artillery to shell some of the puppet police stations in the city. Faced with the dire situation in Saigon, the U.S. aggressors hurriedly patched up their defenses, sending in troops from the U.S. First Cavalry Division to reinforce Saigon, but they still felt uneasy. The U.S.-puppet clique announced on the 4th that the curfew would be shortened, but before it could be implemented, the order was immediately revoked. The New Mountain Airport was announced to be "reopened," but as soon as the sound of the liberation forces' attack guns rang out, the U.S.-puppet clique immediately announced the closure of the airport. A report from Kyodo News Agency said that Saigon had become a "dead city."

In the strategic city of Hue in the north, the U.S.-puppet clique mobilized a large number of troops for a counterattack, but they were met with a fierce counterattack by the people's liberation armed forces. Every street and every building was fiercely contested. On the 4th, the glorious flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was still flying high in this ancient city.

The series of attacks launched by the people's liberation armed forces against enemy strongholds along the demilitarized zone have also made the enemy extremely frightened. On the 3rd, the liberation forces captured the headquarters of the U.S.-puppet joint operations team in Cam Lo, which the enemy regarded as the "key link in the demilitarized zone," and used fierce mortar, rocket, and artillery fire to shell U.S. military positions such as Khe Sanh along the demilitarized zone and the U.S. military airfield in Da Nang. In the Da Nang area, the liberation forces also attacked a U.S.-puppet military unit on the 4th, annihilating a batch of enemies.

In the central cities of Kontum and the Mekong Delta cities of My Tho, Ben Tre, and Vinh Long, the liberation forces and local people continued to annihilate the enemy forces and puppet government thugs in the cities.

In these days of victorious battles, the liberation forces have annihilated a large number of enemy forces. The U.S. aggressors admitted that in the past six days, the number of U.S. soldiers killed was more than in any other week. According to a Reuters report quoting a Japanese news agency, the number of U.S. soldiers wounded and airlifted to the Tokyo area is increasing rapidly. The U.S. naval hospital in Yokosuka and the U.S. army hospital in Yokohama are full of wounded U.S. soldiers.

    在广大人民群众的紧密配合下
    南越解放军再接再厉痛歼敌人
    在南越军民强大猛烈的攻势面前美伪集团乱成一团穷于应付
    新华社河内四日电  越南南方人民解放武装力量在广大人民群众的紧密配合下，发扬英勇顽强的战斗作风，乘胜前进，再接再厉痛歼敌人。
    人民解放武装力量在已经控制的许多大城市内继续追歼敌人，给进行反扑的敌人以迎头痛击。在二日至三日期间，人民解放武装力量向数十个敌占中小城镇发动进攻，并在非军事区南部，发起猛烈的炮轰。在人民解放武装力量的强大而猛烈的攻势面前，美伪集团乱成一团，穷于应付。西方通讯社承认，这几天的激烈战斗“比二十年的战斗中任何其它事情都更为使这个国家（南越伪政权）震动。”
    攻入美伪巢穴西贡的解放武装力量，经过四天的激烈巷战，狠狠打击了敌人，到三日晚上为止，仍占领着这个城市的一些地区。四日清晨和下午，解放武装力量在城东北约十公里的守德附近向敌人发起进攻，并袭击了堤岸地区的美军仓库，使敌人遭到了重大的损失。解放武装力量还用火箭炮轰击市内的一些伪警察所。美国侵略者迫于西贡的危急局势，急忙剜肉补疮，把美国第一骑兵师的部队调进西贡增援，但仍感到惶惶不可终日。美伪集团刚宣布四日缩短“宵禁”，还没等实行，马上又把这项命令撤销。新山一机场刚宣布“恢复使用”，解放武装力量进攻的枪声一响，美伪集团马上又宣布关闭这个机场。日本共同社的消息说，西贡已变成一座“死城”。
    在北部的战略重镇顺化，美伪集团出动大批兵力进行反扑，但遭到人民解放武装力量的迎头痛击。一条条街道，一所所房子，都进行了激烈的争夺。四日，越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜仍高高地在这座古城迎风飘扬。
    人民解放武装力量对非军事区沿线敌军据点发起的一系列进攻，更使敌人惊恐不安。三日，解放武装力量攻占了被敌人视为“非军事区沿线的中心维系环节”的甘露美伪军联合行动部队总部，并用猛烈的迫击炮、火箭炮和大炮轰击非军事区沿线的溪山等美军阵地和岘港美军机场。在岘港地区，解放武装力量四日还袭击了一支美伪军，歼灭一批敌人。
    在中部的昆嵩和湄公河三角洲的美萩、槟椥、永隆等城市中，解放武装力量和当地人民，继续在歼灭城里的敌军和伪政权恶棍。
    在这几天的胜利战斗中，解放武装力量歼灭了大批的敌军有生力量。美国侵略者供认，在过去六天中美军被打死的人数比以往任何一周都要多。据路透社援引一家日本通讯社的消息透露，被空运到东京地区的侵越美军伤兵的数字正在急剧增加。美国的横须贺海军医院和横滨陆军医院已住满了侵越美军。
