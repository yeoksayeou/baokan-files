For the revolution, thousands of difficulties are underfoot.

	Certain division political commissar Wang Xiangcheng: The Chinese Khrushchev shouts about “enduring a bit of hardship, but ultimately gaining great benefits.” This is completely a despicable and shameless petty-bourgeois philosophy. We believe that only when the “public” spirit is deeply rooted in one’s mind and there is “no self-interest,” can one overcome difficulties and hardships for the revolution and the people, and strive hard for decades like one day. Our unit is in a high-altitude “forbidden zone,” fighting against wind and snow, battling severe cold, blasting mountains to build roads, and crossing rivers to build bridges. Comrades regard the harsh environment as the best furnace for tempering themselves. Everyone proudly says: “With a red sun in our hearts, we fear neither ice rivers nor snow mountains; high-altitude forbidden zones are nothing to fear, and the great furnace will temper us into steel.” We strive hard in adversity, relying on the proletarian spirit of “public” and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. We deeply feel that suffering for the revolution is a boundless joy. Struggle is happiness, and hardship is glory!

	Certain division deputy squad leader Ye Naihong: The Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly says, “You suffer first, and benefit later.” This is a bourgeois trick. The soldiers of Mao Zedong’s railway corps have a heart of loyalty to the revolution, for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, they trample thousands of difficulties underfoot. The more difficult the work, the more they rush to do it. When our unit was in the plateau, to solve the problem of vegetables, the company sent me to a distant lowland to plant vegetables. This was a daunting task, especially delivering vegetables to the company and the construction site, the journey was extremely dangerous, requiring climbing cliffs and traversing steep slopes. We have a red heart for the people, fearing no difficulties. Every time we encounter difficulties, we think of the heavy responsibility of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution falling on our shoulders, and we feel that the harder the work and living conditions, the sweeter our hearts. We suffer for the realization of the great goal of communism, not thinking at all about gaining something for ourselves.

	Certain division first platoon leader Lan Guicheng: Our platoon was working in a certain place. In the summer, the weather was extremely hot, sweat dripped down our clothes, and we were soaked from head to toe all day long. We drank dozens of cups of water a day but still couldn’t quench our thirst. Comrades said: “The sun can burn off several layers of our skin, but it can never shake our loyalty to Chairman Mao.” During the construction, some comrades fainted from heatstroke, but as soon as they thought of the great leader Chairman Mao, their blood boiled, and they persisted in the fight. Soldier Fu Shichang fainted twice, and when the squad leader went to help him, he said: “Yu Gong can move two mountains, for the revolution, fainting is nothing!” We soldiers of the railway corps, for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, any hardship in life is nothing, we can all overcome. The Chinese Khrushchev will never be able to understand the lofty revolutionary spirit of our revolutionary soldiers.

For the people, suffering is sweetest.

	Certain division squad leader Su Chuanhai: When our platoon was building a certain large bridge, a landslide blocked the river, and comrades jumped into the icy-cold water one by one to drain it. Everyone shouted: “Even if the snow is cold, it cannot freeze our hearts that love Chairman Mao.” With the revolutionary spirit of enduring great hardships and laboring tirelessly, we completed the bridge several months ahead of schedule. We soldiers of the railway corps fight in the forests, climb cliffs, overcome countless difficulties, conquer numerous obstacles, blast through mountains, and build bridges, constructing railways for the people, connecting all parts of the country. Every time we complete a new railway, we pack our bags and go to new places to take on new tasks. We have never thought about enjoying the benefits of building railways ourselves, nor have we ever thought that suffering is for gaining benefits. We only think of struggling hard for the revolution.

	Certain division assistant technician Hu Qingbi: The Chinese Khrushchev shouts, “You have suffered, and others will know. You suffer first, and benefit later.” This is all nonsense! I graduated from school and came to the railway corps. The places where I fight with my comrades are high mountains and dangerous roads, with strong winds and sandstorms; in the spring, every day the wind blows, and the sand grains hit you so you can’t open your eyes; in the summer, it is extremely hot. Even so, we work day and night, happily laboring. Chairman Mao often teaches us: “To make our country prosperous and strong, we need several decades of hard struggle.” We work diligently according to Chairman Mao’s teachings. For the prosperity of the country, the improvement of people’s lives, for the revolution, for the people, no matter how hard it is, our hearts are always sweet. The Chinese Khrushchev wants people to pursue personal fame and gain, we must thoroughly smash his poisonous revisionist goods that corrupt young people.

For the cause of communism, struggle for life.

	Certain division Miao soldier Chen Qihui: The Chinese Khrushchev says nonsense: “I will do difficult things” and in the future will obtain “happiness.” This is an attempt to lead us down the path of seeking fame and gain. We will not be fooled. We only listen to Chairman Mao’s words. Chairman Mao is the guiding star and great benefactor of our Miao people. Chairman Mao teaches: “Our army is completely for the liberation of the people.” I wholeheartedly follow Chairman Mao’s words. In the construction of defense roads, wherever it is the most difficult, I go there, wherever it is the most dangerous, I go there to work. I think, building railways is the task given to us by Chairman Mao, I want to contribute all my strength. For the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, I will climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire! The life of a revolutionary soldier is a life of struggle, a life of hard work, a life of eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao.

	Certain division political instructor Liu Yanglian: The Chinese Khrushchev regards labor as the greatest “suffering,” and regards comfort in life and material enjoyment as the greatest “blessing”; the view of revolutionary soldiers is the opposite, that is, not to compare with others the advantages and disadvantages of enjoyment, but to compare with others the sincerity of loyalty to Chairman Mao and the spirit of hard struggle. For the revolution, enduring great hardships is the greatest happiness. Last April, the floodwaters surged in the unit’s station, and national property was seriously threatened. Comrade Zhang Zuwen was the first to jump into the water and struggle with the ice-cold water for nearly three hours. When he jumped into the icy water, he did not think about what physical pain he would endure or what he would gain, but thought about the revolution and saving national property. He said: “No matter how small a national matter is, it is a big matter. If you forget the interests of the nation and the happiness of the people, and only care about personal enjoyment, you are not a Communist Party member.” Revolutionary soldiers pursue the realization of communism, the thorough liberation of all people in the world.

On the revolutionary road, every step we take forward is a powerful refutation of the reactionary view of suffering and joy advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. We soldiers of the railway corps must strive harder to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, resolutely criticize and repudiate revisionism, build roads for the revolution for life, live in the mountains for life, and be good soldiers who are eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line.

    无限忠于毛主席　艰苦奋斗为革命
    ——痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的反动的苦乐观（座谈纪要）
    为革命千难万难脚下踩
    某部政委王相成：中国赫鲁晓夫叫喊什么“吃点小苦头，但最后是得大便宜。”这完全是卑鄙无耻的市侩哲学。我们认为，只有“公”字在头脑里扎了根，“毫无自私自利之心”，才能为革命为人民战胜艰难险阻，“艰苦奋斗几十年如一日”。我们部队在高寒“禁区”，战风雪，斗严寒，开山修路，跨水架桥。同志们把艰苦环境当作锻炼自己的最好熔炉，大家豪迈地说：“心中有颗红太阳，冰河雪岭任我闯，高寒禁区何所惧，大好熔炉炼好钢。”我们艰苦奋战，凭的是一个无产阶级的“公”字，靠的是对伟大领袖毛主席的一个“忠”字。我们深深感到，为革命吃苦，其乐无穷。斗争就是幸福，艰苦就是光荣！
    某部副排长叶乃洪：中国赫鲁晓夫无耻地说：“你们吃苦在前，得利在后。”这是资产阶级手法。毛主席的铁道兵战士，一片丹心干革命，为中国革命和世界革命去吃苦，千难万难脚下踩，越是艰苦的工作越是抢着干。我们部队在高原时，为了解决吃菜问题，连里派我到离驻地很远的洼地去种菜。这是一项艰巨的任务，特别是往连队、工地送菜，路途非常艰险，要攀悬崖、翻绝壁。我们一颗红心为人民，什么困难都不怕。每当遇到困难时，一想起中国革命和世界革命的重担落在我们这一代肩上，就感到工作、生活条件越苦心越甜。我们吃苦，为的是实现共产主义的远大目标，丝毫没想到为了自己得点什么。
    某部一连连长蓝贵清：我们连队在某地施工，夏天天气炎热，汗水顺着衣服往下淌，全身上下从早到晚都是湿淋淋的，一天喝十几壶水也不解渴。同志们说：“太阳可以晒脱我们几层皮，但是永远动摇不了我们忠于毛主席的红心。”施工中有的同志中暑昏倒了，可是他们一想到伟大领袖毛主席，就热血沸腾，坚持战斗。战士傅士昌两次昏倒，排长去扶他，他却说：“愚公能搬走两座大山，我为革命，昏倒算什么？”我们铁道兵战士，为了中国革命和世界革命，任何艰苦的生活都不在话下，都可以战胜。中国赫鲁晓夫是永远也不可能理解我们革命战士这种高尚的革命精神的。
    为人民吃苦心最甜
    某部班长苏传海：我们连在修建某大桥的时候，发生坍方把河道堵死，同志们一个个跳到冰冷刺骨的水里，抢着排水。大家高呼：冰雪再冷，冷不了我们热爱毛主席的红心。我们以吃大苦、耐大劳的革命精神，提前几个月修通了这座大桥。我们铁道兵战士，战林海，攀悬崖，克服种种困难，战胜重重障碍，挖通座座大山，筑起座座桥梁，为人民修起了一条条铁路，把全国各地联在一起。每当修好一条崭新的铁路以后，我们又背上背包到新的地方，去迎接新的任务，我们从没有去想过我们修好了铁路自己就要享受，从来没有想到吃苦是为了得便宜。我们一心只想到为革命而艰苦奋斗。
    某部助理技术员胡清碧：中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷什么“你们受了苦，人家会知道的。你们吃苦在前，得利在后。”这是一派妖言！我是从学校毕业来到铁道兵的。我和战友们战斗的地方，山高路险，风沙大；春季每天刮风，刮起的沙粒打得你睁不开眼；夏天非常炎热。就是这样，我们夜以继日地紧张施工，愉快地劳动。毛主席经常这样教导我们：“要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间”。我们按照毛主席的教导勤奋地工作。为了国家的富强，人民生活的改善，为革命，为人民，再苦也不苦，心眼里总是甜滋滋的。中国赫鲁晓夫要人们追求个人名利，我们要彻底砸烂他毒害青年人的修正主义黑货。
    为共产主义事业奋斗终生
    某部苗族战士陈启辉：中国赫鲁晓夫胡说：“困难的事我拿来做”将来便会得到“幸福”。这是妄图要把我们拉向图名图利的邪路上去。我们决不上他的当。我们只听毛主席的话。毛主席是我们苗家的指路星、大恩人。毛主席教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的”。我一个心眼地照毛主席的话去做。在战备修路中，哪里最艰苦，我就到哪里去，哪里最危险，我就到哪里干。我想，修建铁路，是毛主席交给我们的任务，我要贡献出自己的一切力量。为了中国革命和世界革命，是刀山也要上，是火海也要闯！我们革命战士的一生就是战斗的一生，是艰苦奋斗的一生，是永远忠于毛主席的一生。
    某部政治指导员刘养连：中国赫鲁晓夫把劳动看成是最大的“苦”，把生活上的安逸，物质上的享受，看成是最大的“福”；我们革命战士的看法同这种观点相反，那就是不同别人计较享受的优劣，而同别人比忠于毛主席的赤诚，比艰苦奋斗的精神。为革命吃大苦就感到最大的幸福。去年四月，部队驻地洪水暴涨，国家财产受到严重威胁。张祖文同志第一个跳下水，与冰水搏斗近三小时。他跳进刺骨的冰水里的时候，想的不是肉体要经受什么痛苦，自己得到什么，而是为革命，为抢救国家财产。他说：“国家的事再小也是大事，如果忘了国家的利益，忘了人民的幸福，光顾个人享受，还算什么共产党员？”革命战士所追求的是实现共产主义，是全世界人民的彻底解放。
    在革命的道路上，我们每前进一步，都是对中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的反动苦乐观的一个最有力驳斥。我们铁道兵战士一定要更努力地活学活用毛主席著作，坚决斗私批修，为革命修一辈子路，住一辈子山沟，做一个永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的好战士。
