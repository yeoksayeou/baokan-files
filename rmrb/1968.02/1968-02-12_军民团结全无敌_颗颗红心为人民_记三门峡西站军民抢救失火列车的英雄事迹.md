The great situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat throughout the country is excellent, not just a little good. The overall situation is better than ever before. The important sign of the excellent situation is that the people have been fully mobilized.

Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today. The unity between the military and the people, based on Mao Zedong Thought, is stronger and more invincible than ever before.

People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can withstand the collapse of the sky and fill in the sinking earth. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the spirit of the proletariat in their hearts, daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire!

Just as the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," the torrents of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat surged forward more vigorously. On the land of Zhongzhou, at Sanmenxia West Station, the heroic deed of soldiers and civilians bravely rescuing a burning train loaded with toxic pesticides added another magnificent song of victory to the great Mao Zedong Thought!

Mao Zedong's teachings are the highest combat orders

On October 30, 1967, at Sanmenxia West Station, the train whistles blew, and the locomotives roared. Trains loaded with comrades heading to different battle stations and trains loaded with various construction materials passed through here one after another.

The soldiers and workers of the 6063 Unit's 1st Battalion, who were carrying out the task of supporting the leftists, were filled with the fighting spirit of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and were preparing for the evening meeting to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism.

At 13:05, the 1719 train, loaded with goods from Zhengzhou to Xi'an, pulled into Sanmenxia West Station.

Suddenly, someone noticed that the fourth-to-last car was smoking. The news of the car catching fire spread to the support office and to the nearby company.

National property and the entire station were facing a serious threat!

"Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the interests of the people."

Mao Zedong's teachings are the highest combat orders. The flames and thick smoke were the signals for the charge. The soldiers of the artillery and machine gun companies, filled with the fighting spirit of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, rushed forward like arrows leaving the bow, straight towards the burning train.

The soldier Zhao Jizhuang from the artillery company and a worker were the first to open the iron door of the burning car. A thick cloud of smoke rushed out.

Inside the car, layer upon layer of wooden boxes filled with pesticides were packed tightly. Hands could not reach in, and people could not climb up. The thick smoke was rolling, and the pesticide boxes were burning...

"What do we do?" Zhao Jizhuang clenched his fists, his eyes wide open, and his brows furrowed tightly.

"Form a human ladder!"

A word reminded Zhao Jizhuang. He quickly climbed up the human ladder. Just as he touched the top box, he was blown down by the strong blast from inside the car.

"Our army has the spirit of pressing forward and will never be subdued by the enemy." A quote from Chairman Mao is like a powerful spiritual atomic bomb. Zhao Jizhuang thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, stood up firmly, and bravely charged forward again! The flames and thick smoke could not stop the soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With a "crack," this young Communist Party member finally pulled out the first box of pesticides from the top of the car, despite the thick smoke.

At this moment, Zhao Jizhuang's head was spinning, and tears were streaming down his face. He thought, "Now is the time to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism! As long as I have a breath, I must persist. The more boxes I move out, the less loss the people will suffer." Just as he was moving the third box, he felt his vision go black, a wave of nausea, and vomited two mouthfuls of yellow water. His body could no longer support him.

One soldier fainted, and more soldiers rushed forward. Soldiers Pan Weigen and Ye Lian quickly charged forward. Another wave of thick smoke with a strong pungent odor knocked them down.

"Poisonous! Poisonous!" Someone discovered the toxic pesticide markings on the wooden boxes. After a doctor's examination, it was found to be a highly toxic pesticide.

It was a highly toxic pesticide! What should be done?

Extinguishing the fire directly threatened the health and safety of the rescuers!

Not extinguishing it, the pesticides continued to burn, the poisonous smoke continued to spread, national property was damaged, and the health and safety of the people were threatened, causing the transportation to be disrupted.

"We are responsible to the people." Chairman Mao's great teachings echoed in their ears. The flames of battle burned in their hearts.

"Save! Definitely save! Quickly save!"

The soldiers shouted the slogan "Strugle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" and charged forward from both sides of the car.

A battle to fight against the flames and poisonous smoke began!

Flames and red hearts connected

The flames were burning fiercely, and the poisonous smoke was spreading everywhere...

For the revolution, daring to leap into mountains of knives and seas of fire; for the people, fearing neither being crushed nor shattered.

The artillery company's political instructor, Bao Longkui, stepped onto the car, held the door with one hand, and shouted, "Comrades, the time to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism with actual actions has come!" He stuffed his hat into his mouth, dived into the poisonous smoke and fire, fighting and commanding. His head spun, his eyes blurred, and his limbs weakened. He fell down. But he quickly stood up and continued to fight.

The flames and thick smoke summoned countless rescuers. The soldiers of the "February 7th Commune" charged forward! The young Red Guards ran over! Family members, children, and nearby commune members all rushed over! They spontaneously formed a rescue army of thousands.

As soon as the crowd arrived, they wanted to rush onto the car. The soldiers shouted, "'February 7th Commune' comrades! Comrades! As long as we are here, the car is here; there is danger here, you cannot come up!"

The crowd participating in the rescue shouted in unison, "No, no, no! The PLA is our family, if there is danger, we all share it. Comrades, charge forward, charge forward!..."

"Rather let us sacrifice, we must not let the crowd be poisoned!" The soldiers below immediately formed a human wall to stop the crowd from boarding the car. Those who did not board the car spontaneously formed an unbreakable conveyor belt, moving the pesticide boxes one by one to a safe area; they also brought buckets of water from afar and pulled water hoses, pouring water onto the burning train.

The soldiers on the car, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the masses who put the public interest first, fought even more bravely.

Communist Party member and machine gun company's 5th Platoon leader Yang Rumin had already fainted for the third time. Comrades carried him down for emergency treatment. He gradually regained consciousness and, seeing the tense rescue scene and hearing the slogans "Determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," he thought of the heroic image of Li Wentong, the model for supporting the left and loving the people, who fought against the waves of the Gan River to rescue the Red Guards. A few days ago, he wrote in his diary: "I vow to be like Comrade Li Wentong, to make a revolution in the depths of my soul, to thoroughly uproot the root of selfishness, to replace it with a completely red heart for the people, to install a steel frame of the proletariat, to march towards great communism, and to be a new person of communism." Now, his blood was boiling. The car was a car full of rolling poisonous smoke, and entering it for a few minutes would cause one to faint. The car was a battlefield for struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, charging in was a battle against the "self," and it was a powerful criticism of the "survival philosophy" of China's Khrushchev.

Thinking of this, Yang Rumin leaped up and charged into the car again, passing pesticide boxes out in the rolling thick smoke. One box, two boxes, three boxes... each box showed a red heart.

The PLA is the people's army!

Seeing their own family members bravely and loyally fighting for the people, the soldiers of the "February 7th Commune" shouted slogans and charged into the car. Deputy driver Chen Jiujun had been fighting in the most dangerous area where the fire was the fiercest and the smoke was the thickest.

The "Iron Five" Red Guards formed the "Little Tiger" assault team and charged into the car; family members also charged into the car...

As soon as the crowd got on the car, Sergeant Xu Weizhi took the mask off a Red Guard and put it on another soldier. The love between the military and the people, the unity between the military and the people, the bone-deep affection between the military and the people, shook everyone's heart.

The military and the people united as one, see who can defeat us? On the car, they struggled to move the boxes; below the car, they quickly transported them. The pesticide boxes were moved to the safe area like a flowing stream.

Suddenly, the station broadcasted, "Attention, attention! The 36th express train is about to enter the station!"

The rescuers heard the news, and their anxious hearts were like oil on fire.

What should be done? If the train is allowed to enter the station on time, the passengers will be in danger of poisoning; if the train is not allowed to enter the station, the entire operation plan will be disrupted; if the burning train is moved away from the platform, the wind will be stronger, the fire will be more intense, the poisonous smoke will be thicker, and it will definitely bring more difficulties to the rescue and more danger to the rescuers.

"Absolutely cannot let the transportation be disrupted! Absolutely cannot let the passengers be poisoned!" Political instructor Lu Guizhi decisively ordered, "Move the train immediately!"

The political instructor spoke the words in everyone's heart. Immediately, on and below the car, they spontaneously shouted, "Determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." This voice expressed the soldiers' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, their unlimited love for the people, and their heroic spirit of daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire.

The locomotive started, the wheels spun, and people chased after the burning train!

The 2nd Company, which had won numerous battle merits in wartime, made a vow in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat: "Protecting the great leader Chairman Mao is our first responsibility; defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our first task; reading Chairman Mao's books is our first need; being a good soldier of Chairman Mao is our first wish." Now, under the leadership of Political Instructor Liu Chuhai, they divided the battle groups while running. As soon as the train stopped, the assault team charged onto the car, braving the flames.

At this moment, the car was like a burning furnace.

The 4th Platoon leader Wang Gensheng hugged the water hose, dousing the fire wherever it was the fiercest. Soon, the heat and smoke made him see nothing, but he still held the water hose like an iron man. His pants caught fire, and he looked at the flames on his body, thinking: Loyalty to Chairman Mao is shown in whether one can act according to Chairman Mao's teachings and dedicate everything to the people. He made up his mind that even if he were burned to a crisp, he would not retreat. When comrades pulled him down from the car, he was still gasping, "Determine to overcome all difficulties..."

The battle lasted until 23:00 at night, and the flames were finally extinguished. They rescued most of the pesticides, ensuring the safety of people's lives and property, and ensuring the smooth operation of the Longhai Railway.

All glory belongs to the great leader Chairman Mao

The battle to extinguish the flames had just ended, and the battle to rescue the poisoned soldiers was in full swing.

At this moment, from our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao's residence in the capital Beijing, came the inspiring news: Premier Zhou made two phone calls inquiring about the incident and the health of the injured, and gave important instructions.

Soon, the most inspiring news came: Chairman Mao sent a medical team! Medical personnel from Beijing, Jinan, Wuhan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xuzhou, and other places, carrying the care of the Party and the people, arrived one after another.

Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's care was like a great warm current flowing into everyone's heart, encouraging the white-clad warriors working tirelessly, encouraging the poisoned soldiers who had just regained consciousness, encouraging the crowd waiting outside the hospital. People's faces were wet with tears of happiness. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed across the sky of Sanmenxia West.

"Chairman Mao cares for us, Chairman Mao is with us. With Chairman Mao commanding our battle, we can overcome any difficulty. We must rescue all the injured soldiers!" The medical staff of the railway hospital trampled on the difficulties of insufficient medical equipment, poor conditions, and lack of experience, expressing their firm resolve to the great leader Chairman Mao.

"With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we dare to take on any risk!" The red white-clad warriors, in the midst of intense consultations, read Chairman Mao's quotes: "Comrade White is selfless and dedicated to the people. This is shown in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist Party member should learn from him." The heroes' selfless and fearless noble images inspired them to bravely shoulder the burden. The red white-clad warriors of Chairman Mao worked tirelessly, dedicating themselves to the intense rescue work.

The hospitalized soldiers never forgot Chairman Mao's teachings to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people and to "care for others more than oneself." Some comrades left the best medicine for others to use; some comrades quietly placed fruit by others' pillows; some comrades, supporting their weak bodies, cleaned the place; some comrades, to let the doctors concentrate on treating the seriously injured, secretly returned to their company. They forgot fatigue and pain, and together with the revolutionary crowd who came to visit, they studied Chairman Mao's works.

Comrade Yang Rumin was in a coma for three days and three nights. When he woke up, he opened his swollen red eyes and saw nothing. The nurse asked him, "What do you see?" Yang Rumin excitedly and intermittently said, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! He is waving at me, smiling!" Then, he saw him frantically searching with both hands.

"What are you looking for?"

"I haven't done my 'early report,' where is my 'Quotations from Chairman Mao'?"

It turned out that this five-star soldier's habit of "early report, late summary, and strict self-examination in everything" was formed over the years of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and it was a broad path for his growth.

To commend the soldiers of the 1st Battalion for their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and their heroic qualities and deeds of being selfless and dedicated to the people, the Jinan Military Region Party Committee awarded the 6063 Unit's 1st Battalion a collective second-class merit and the artillery company a collective first-class merit. On January 20, a grand celebration meeting was held at Sanmenxia West Station. The soldiers of the 1st Battalion excitedly said: All glory should be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Achievements should be credited to the people, to the collective, and to the "public" spirit.

The spring breeze and willows are countless, and all of China is like Shun and Yao.

The heroic soldiers and civilians, tempered by the battles of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, played the strongest melody of life, singing another song of victory for Mao Zedong Thought with their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is excellent and will be even better!

In the new year, let us raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, broaden our vision to see the future, advance steadfastly, follow the great commander Chairman Mao, and strive for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

    军民团结全无敌　颗颗红心为人民
    ——记三门峡西站军民抢救失火列车的英雄事迹
    “全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。”毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心，在毛泽东思想基础上的军民团结，比以往任何时期都坚强无敌。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，天塌下来顶得住，地陷下去填得平。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，无产阶级“公”字在胸，刀山敢上，火海敢闯！
    正当伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，无产阶级文化大革命的洪流更加汹涌澎湃滚滚向前的时候，在中州大地上的三门峡西站，军民奋勇抢救烈性农药失火列车的英雄事迹，又谱出一曲伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利凯歌！
    毛主席的教导就是最高战斗命令
    一九六七年十月三十日这天，在三门峡西车站，汽笛长鸣，机车隆隆。满载奔赴不同战斗岗位的战友的客车源源不断地从这里通过，满载各种建设物资的货车源源不断地从这里通过。……
    在这里执行支左任务的六○六三部队某部一营的指战员和站上革命职工们，满怀无产阶级文化大革命的战斗激情，正在为晚上军民斗私批修大会作准备。
    十三点零五分，一列由郑州开往西安方面去的满载货物的一七一九次列车，驶进三门峡西车站。
    突然，有人发现倒数第四节车厢冒烟。车厢着火的消息，传到了支左办公室，传到了车站附近的连队。
    国家财产和整个车站面临着严重威胁！
    “我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    毛主席的教导就是最高战斗命令。火光、浓烟就是冲锋的号角。炮连、机枪连的指战员满怀着在斗私批修中焕发出来的战斗豪情，一个个象离弦的箭一样，纵身飞步，直向失火列车奔去。
    跑在最前边的炮连战士赵吉庄和一个工人抢先把失火车厢的铁门打开了，一股浓烟夺门而出。
    车厢内，密密层层装满了盛着农药的木箱。手插不进，人上不去。浓烟在翻滚，药箱在燃烧……
    “怎么办？”赵吉庄急得紧握拳头，两眼瞪着，浓眉紧锁。
    “搭人梯！”
    一句话提醒了赵吉庄。他抢先顺着人梯冲了上去。谁知，刚刚摸到顶上的药箱，就被车厢内冲出的强烈气浪打了下来。
    “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”一条毛主席语录，就是一颗威力强大的精神原子弹。赵吉庄想到毛主席的教导，坚强地站起来，又勇敢地冲上去！烈火浓烟阻挡不住用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士。只听“咔嚓”一声，这位年青的共产党员终于冒着浓烟从车厢顶上抽出了第一箱农药。
    这时，浓烟熏得赵吉庄头晕目眩，泪水直淌。他想：“现在正是斗私批修的好时刻！只要我还有一口气，就要坚持下去。多搬出一箱，人民就少一分损失。”就在他搬第三箱的时候，只觉得眼前一黑，一阵恶心，呕吐了两口黄水，身子再也支持不住了。
    一个战士昏倒下去，更多的战士冲上来。战士潘为根、叶连和毫不犹豫地冲了上去。又一股带着强烈刺鼻臭味的浓烟把他俩熏倒在地上。
    “有毒！有毒！”有人发现木箱上有剧毒药品标记。经医生检查，是一种烈性农药。
    是剧毒药品！怎么办？
    救火，直接威胁着抢救人员的健康和生命安全！
    不救，农药继续燃烧，毒烟继续扩散，国家财产遭到损失，人民健康和生命安全受到威胁，交通运输就会中断。
    “我们的责任，是向人民负责。”毛主席的伟大教导响在耳边。战斗的烈火烧在心田。
    “救！坚决救！赶快救！”
    指战员们高喊着“要斗私，批修”的口号，从车厢两边冲了上去。
    一场与烈焰、毒烟搏斗的抢险战打响了！
    烈火红心心相连
    烈火在熊熊燃烧，毒烟在弥天扩散……
    为革命，刀山火海敢闯；为人民，不怕粉身碎骨。
    炮连指导员包龙奎一脚踏上车，一手把住车门，高喊：“同志们，用实际行动斗私批修的时候到了！”他把帽子往嘴里一塞，钻进毒烟火海，边战斗，边指挥。头发昏，眼发花，手脚发软，他跌倒了。但他很快站了起来，继续坚持战斗。
    火光浓烟召来了无数抢险的战士。“二七公社”战士杀上来了！红卫兵小将跑来了！家属、小孩、附近的社员都赶来了！自动组成了一支数千人的抢险大军。
    群众一赶到，就要往车上冲。指战员们高喊：“‘二七公社’战友们！同志们！有我们在，就有车在；这里有危险，你们不能上！”
    参加抢救的群众异口同声地喊了起来：“不行，不行，不行！解放军是我们的亲人，有危险大家担，同志们冲上去，冲上去！……”
    “宁肯我们牺牲，决不能让群众中毒！”车下的指战员立即组成一道道“人墙”，劝阻群众上车。没有冲上车的人们，就自动组成了一条压不垮、扯不断的传送带，将农药一箱箱转移到安全地带；又从远处提来一桶桶水，拉来水管，向失火列车浇去。
    车上的指战员们在革命群众舍己为公的革命精神鼓舞下，更加英勇地战斗着。
    共产党员、机枪连五班班长杨汝明，已经第三次昏倒了。同志们把他抱下来急救。他逐渐苏醒后，看着紧张抢救的人群，听着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的口号声，脑子里出现了“支左爱民模范”李文忠奋战赣江浪、抢救红卫兵的英雄形象。几天前，他在自己的日记上写道：“誓死象李文忠同志那样，在灵魂深处闹革命，彻底挖掉私字病根，换上一颗完全彻底为人民服务的红心，装上一副无产阶级的钢筋铁骨，向伟大的共产主义进军，做共产主义的新人。”现在，他浑身热血沸腾。车厢，是毒烟滚滚的车厢，人进去几分钟就被熏倒。车厢，是斗私批修的战场，冲进去就是向“私”字开战，就是对中国赫鲁晓夫“活命哲学”的最有力的批判。
    想到这里，杨汝明一跃而起，再一次冲进车厢，在滚滚浓烟中，猛往外递药箱。一箱、两箱、三箱……箱箱见红心。
    解放军，是人民的子弟兵啊！
    眼看着自己的亲人赤胆忠心为人民，“二七公社”战士高喊着口号冲进了车厢。副司机陈久君一直奋战在火最猛、烟最浓的“险区”。
    “铁中”五个红卫兵小将组成的“小老虎”突击队冲进了车厢；家属也冲进了车厢……
    群众一上车，排长徐维智把口罩给红卫兵小将尹国安戴上，尹国安马上又把口罩转给另一个解放军战士。军爱民，民拥军，军民团结骨肉亲的激情，震荡着每个人的心。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？车上奋力抢搬，车下飞速转运，药箱象流水一样迅速往安全地带转移。
    突然，车站广播：“注意，注意！三十六次快车马上就要进站！”
    抢救的人群听到这消息，焦急的心就象火上浇了一桶油。
    怎么办？如果让列车准时进站，旅客们就有中毒的危险；如果不让列车进站，就会打乱整个运行计划；如果把失火列车调离站台，那么车开风更大，风大火更旺，火旺毒烟更浓，必然给抢救带来更大困难，给抢救人员带来更大的生命威胁。
    “绝不能让交通中断！绝不能让旅客中毒！”教导员卢贵芝果断地下令：“马上调车！”
    教导员说出了大家的心里话。顿时，车上、车下，不约而同地喊起：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这声音，道出了战士们对毛主席的无限忠诚，这声音，道出了战士们对人民群众的无限热爱，这声音，道出了战士们刀山敢上，火海敢闯的英雄本色。
    机车启动，车轮飞转，人们跟着着火的列车飞奔！
    在战争年代屡建战功的二连，在无产阶级文化大革命中，立下了这样的誓言：“保卫伟大领袖毛主席，是我们的第一责任；捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们的第一任务；读毛主席的书，是我们的第一需要；做毛主席的好战士，是我们的第一志愿。”现在，他们在指导员刘楚海率领下，边跑边划分战斗小组。车刚一停，突击组就冒着烈火冲上车厢。
    这时的车厢，人一进去就象进了熊熊燃烧的大火炉。
    四班长王根生抱着水龙头，哪里火最大就往哪里扑。一会儿，火烤烟熏，他眼前什么也看不见了，但是他还象铁人一样双手抱着水龙。他的裤子着火了，他望望身上的烈火，心想：对毛主席忠不忠，就看能不能按毛主席的教导办事，为人民献出自己的一切。他下定决心，就是被烈火烧焦了也决不后退。当同志们把他拉下车厢时，他嘴里还断断续续地喊着“下定决心，……”
    战斗一直到夜间二十三点，烈火彻底被扑灭。他们抢救出了绝大部分农药，保证了人民生命财产的安全，保证了陇海铁路的畅通。
    一切光荣归于伟大领袖毛主席
    扑灭烈火的战斗刚刚结束，抢救中毒伤员的战斗正在紧张进行。
    就在这时，从我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席居住的地方——首都北京，传来了振奋人心的消息：周总理两次来电话询问事件发生的经过和伤员健康情况，并作了重要指示。
    紧接着又传来了最最振奋人心的喜讯：毛主席他老人家派医疗队来了！北京、济南、武汉、西安、郑州、洛阳、徐州等地大批医务人员带着党和人民的关怀陆续赶来了。
    毛主席、党中央的关怀，象一股巨大的暖流传到每个人的心，激励着紧张工作的白衣战士，激励着刚刚苏醒的中毒战士，激励着守候在医院内外的人群。人们脸上挂着幸福的热泪。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声响彻三门峡西地区的长空。
    “毛主席关怀着我们，毛主席就在我们身边。有毛主席指挥我们战斗，什么困难都能克服。我们一定要把伤员全部抢救过来！”铁路医院的医务人员把医院设备少、条件差、没经验等等困难，统统踩在脚下，向伟大领袖毛主席表达了他们的坚强决心。
    “有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，天大的风险也敢担！”红色白衣战士在紧张的会诊中，朗读毛主席语录：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”英雄们无私、无畏的崇高形象，激励着他们勇敢地担起重担。毛主席的红色白衣战士废寝忘食地投入了紧张的抢救工作。
    住院的战士们，他们一时一刻也没有忘记毛主席教导的要“完全”“彻底”为人民服务、“关心他人比关心自己为重”。有的同志把最好的药品留给别人用；有的同志悄悄地把水果送到别人枕头边；有的同志支撑着虚弱的身子打扫卫生；有的同志为了让医生集中精力治疗重伤员，自己偷偷溜回连队。他们忘记了疲劳和伤疼，和来看望的革命群众一起学习毛主席著作。
    杨汝明同志整整昏迷了三天三夜。当他清醒过来时，睁着一对红肿的眼睛什么也看不见。护士问他：“你看见什么了吗？”杨汝明激动地、断断续续地说：“毛主席，毛主席！他老人家在对我招手，微笑！”接着，只见他双手在身上乱摸。
    “你摸什么？”
    “我还没有‘早请示’，我的《毛主席语录》呢？”
    原来，这位五好战士“早请示，晚汇报，一事当前狠对照”，是他几年来活学活用毛主席著作养成的习惯，是他成长的一条宽广大道。
    为了表彰一营指战员无限忠于毛主席和一心为公、一心为人民的英雄品质与英雄行为，济南部队党委给六○六三部队某部一营荣记集体二等功和该营炮连集体一等功，并于一月二十日在三门峡西站隆重举行了庆功大会。一营的战士们激动地说：一切光荣应该归于伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。成绩应该算在人民的账上，集体的账上，“公”字的账上。
    春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗洗礼的英雄军民，用生命的最强音奏出了一支雄壮的斗私批修的进行曲，用无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想的赤胆忠心唱出了又一曲毛泽东思想的胜利凯歌。
    无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，而且越来越好！
    在新的一年里，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
