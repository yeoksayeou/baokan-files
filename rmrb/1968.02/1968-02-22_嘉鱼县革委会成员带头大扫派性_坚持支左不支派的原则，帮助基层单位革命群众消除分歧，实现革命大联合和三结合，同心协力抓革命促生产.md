Since the establishment of the Jia Yu County Revolutionary Committee in Hubei Province, the members have taken the lead in eliminating factionalism, adhering to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. They have helped grassroots units and revolutionary masses resolve differences, achieve revolutionary unity, and implement the three-in-one combination. They have united to seize the revolution and promote production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 20th—After the establishment of the Jia Yu County Revolutionary Committee, the members, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, took the lead in exposing and criticizing their own shortcomings, combating factionalism, and strengthening their party spirit. They mobilized the people of the entire county to launch a "people's war" against factionalism, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented. Revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination have been consolidated and developed, and the entire county is in a vibrant atmosphere of revolution and production.

The establishment of the Jia Yu County Revolutionary Committee is a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, some people still harbor bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in their minds, which soon manifested in issues such as division of labor and relations between old and new cadres, affecting the smooth progress of work.

As soon as bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism reared its head, it was immediately met with resistance and opposition from the masses, alerting the committee members. The Revolutionary Committee organized all members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." They studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "wholeheartedly serving the people," conducted self-examinations, and recalled the bitterness of factionalism and internal strife. They discussed the sweetness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and overcoming factionalism, the current good situation, and the hopes of the masses for the Revolutionary Committee. This helped some comrades break free from trivial issues and focus on the bigger picture. One comrade said: The masses' selection of us as servants is the greatest trust they have placed in us. If we engage in factionalism, not only do we betray the trust of the masses, but we are also disloyal to Chairman Mao. They voluntarily exposed their selfishness, fiercely criticized it, thoroughly uprooted factionalism, and conducted serious self-criticism. They elevated the struggle against factionalism to the level of the two-line struggle, significantly raising their class consciousness. Both sides involved in factionalism conducted self-criticism, and the problems were smoothly resolved.

After the establishment of the county Revolutionary Committee, they shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production for the entire county. In some regions and units, there were disagreements among mass organizations, and they all turned to the Revolutionary Committee for help. The committee members studied the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions" from the People's Liberation Army. They firmly supported whatever was in line with Mao Zedong Thought and criticized and assisted whatever was not. They enthusiastically conducted ideological and political work. In cases where revolutionary mass organizations were severely opposed, the Revolutionary Committee insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to persuade both sides to conduct more self-criticism. When the Revolutionary Committee was under attack, they followed Chairman Mao's instructions, replacing "fear" with "dare," "self" with "public," and "believing in oneself" with "believing in the masses." They educated and mobilized the masses to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and promote revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

In one unit, two mass organizations had been in conflict for five months. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, both sides sought support from the committee. The committee sent people to conduct investigations and research in the unit, adhering to the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions." They gathered the leaders and members of both sides to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilized the masses to launch a revolutionary criticism campaign, and directed their hatred towards the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev. Both sides eliminated their hostile attitudes, conducted more self-criticism, and quickly achieved revolutionary unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the sharpest weapons for overthrowing factionalism and consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. After the establishment of the county Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can the war be waged, and only by relying on the people can the war be waged." The committee organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the county, formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, mobilized various propaganda tools, held various meetings, and propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They used Chairman Mao's latest instructions to mobilize the people and launch a "people's war" against factionalism.

With Chairman Mao's latest instructions grasped by the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism fell into the vast sea of the people's war, with nowhere to hide. Those class enemies who plotted to use factionalism for evil activities were also exposed by the revolutionary masses. The Hongwei District Hebei Brigade held a three-in-one combination Mao Zedong Thought study class. Both sides of the masses, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, exposed twenty crimes of factionalism and found that the long-term factionalism and internal strife in the brigade were due to the instigation and separation of class enemies. Both sides of the revolutionary masses united in their hatred of the enemy, exposed and fiercely criticized the landlord elements who were conducting sabotage activities, and quickly achieved revolutionary unity. The broad revolutionary masses were fully mobilized. Some leaders of mass organizations had difficulties in their thoughts, and the revolutionary masses actively sought them out for heart-to-heart talks, jointly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, jointly exposed and criticized their selfishness, helped the leaders eliminate selfishness, overcome factionalism, and further consolidated revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

The broad revolutionary masses overthrew factionalism and treated cadres with proletarian party spirit, enabling a large number of cadres to return to their posts and play a role in the revolutionary and productive struggles. In a previous period, cadres who participated in the county, district, and commune revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs or leading groups did not dare to work boldly due to the factionalism not being overcome in the revolutionary mass organizations. The county Revolutionary Committee promptly convened a meeting of county, district, and commune-level mass organization leaders to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, break factionalism, establish party spirit, unify thoughts, correctly treat cadres, and help cadres bravely come forward for the revolution, boldly seize the revolution, and promote production. The broad revolutionary cadres also followed Chairman Mao's teachings, put down their burdens, started their machines, humbly learned from the masses, and strived to seize the revolution and promote production. This powerfully promoted the consolidation and development of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination throughout the county.

    嘉鱼县革委会成员带头大扫派性
    坚持支左不支派的原则，帮助基层单位革命群众消除分歧，实现革命大联合和三结合，同心协力抓革命促生产
    据新华社武汉二十日电　湖北省嘉鱼县革命委员会成立以后，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，革委会成员带头亮私斗私，打倒派性，增强党性，并发动全县人民展开了一场围剿派性的“人民战争”，使毛主席的最新指示进一步全面落实，革命大联合和革命三结合得到巩固和发展，全县出现革命、生产热气腾腾的大好局面。
    嘉鱼县革命委员会的成立，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。但是在一部分人头脑里，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性还没有彻底打倒，因此革委会成立后不久，就在分工、新老干部关系等方面表现出来，影响了工作的顺利开展。
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性一经露头，立即遭到群众的抵制、反对，引起委员们的警惕。革命委员会组织全体委员反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”学习毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的伟大教导，对照检查自己。委员们回忆闹派性、打“内战”的苦，大谈落实毛主席最新指示、克服派性的甜，大摆当前的大好形势，大讲群众对革委会的希望，使一些同志从枝节问题中跳出来，胸中有了大局。有的同志说：群众推选我们当勤务员，是对我们最大的信任。我们闹派性，不仅辜负了群众的信任，而且是对毛主席的不忠。他们自觉地大亮私字，狠斗私字，猛挖派性，认真地进行自我批评，并把铲除派性的斗争，提到两条路线斗争的高度，大大提高了阶级觉悟。闹派性的同志双方都作了自我批评，问题就顺利解决了。
    县革命委员会成立后，担负了全县革命、生产两副重担。有些地区，有些单位群众组织发生分歧，都找到革委会来。革委会的同志学习解放军“支左不支派”的原则，凡是符合毛泽东思想的就坚决支持，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的就批评、帮助，热情地作思想政治工作。有的革命群众组织严重对立，革委会坚持用毛泽东思想说服双方各自多做自我批评。在革命委员会受到冲击的时候，他们遵循毛主席的指示，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“我”字换成“公”字，把相信自己换成相信群众，教育群众，发动群众去打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，加强无产阶级党性，促进革命大联合和革命三结合。
    有一个单位的两个群众组织长期对立，打了五个月的“内战”。革委会成立以后，两派都要求革委会支持，他们就派人深入该单位进行调查研究，坚持“支左不支派”，把两派头头、群众找在一起反复学习毛主席的最新指示，发动群众开展革命大批判，把仇恨集中在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派身上。两派群众消除了对立情绪，各自多做自我批评，在毛泽东思想的基础上很快实现了革命大联合。
    毛主席的最新指示是打倒派性、巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合最锐利的武器。县革命委员会成立后，遵循毛主席的教导：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”在全县大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织毛泽东思想宣传队，动员各种宣传工具，召开各种会议，宣传、贯彻毛主席的最新指示，用毛主席的最新指示发动群众，打一场围剿派性的“人民战争”。
    毛主席的最新指示为广大工人、贫下中农和革命干部所掌握，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性就陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中，无处躲藏，那些阴谋利用派性进行罪恶活动的阶级敌人也被革命群众揭发出来。红卫区河北大队举办了三结合的毛泽东思想学习班，两派群众通过斗私批修，揭出派性的二十条罪状，找出了这个大队长期闹宗派，打“内战”，是由于阶级敌人的挑拨离间。两派革命群众同仇敌忾，把进行破坏活动的地主分子揭出来狠斗狠批，很快地实现了革命大联合。广大革命群众充分发动起来了，有些群众组织头头思想不通，革命群众就主动找头头谈心，共同学习毛主席的最新指示，共同亮私斗私，帮助头头铲除私心，克服派性，使革命大联合和革命三结合进一步巩固。
    广大革命群众打倒派性，用无产阶级党性对待干部，使大批干部走上工作岗位，在革命、生产斗争中发挥作用。前一段时期，参加了县、区、社革命三结合临时权力机构或领导小组的干部，不少人由于革命群众组织中派性没有克服，不敢大胆工作。对这种状况，县革命委员会及时召开县、区、社三级群众组织负责人会议，学习毛主席的最新指示，大破派性，大立党性，用毛主席最新指示统一思想，统一认识，正确对待干部，帮助干部勇敢地站出来革命，大胆抓革命，促生产。广大革命干部也遵循毛主席的教导，放下包袱，开动机器，虚心向群众学习，努力抓革命，促生产，有力地促进了全县革命大联合和革命三结合的巩固和发展。
