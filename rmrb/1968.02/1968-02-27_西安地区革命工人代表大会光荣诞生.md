In the radiant light of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and amidst the triumphant songs of the nationwide military and civilian victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of Xi'an Region was officially established. On February 25, revolutionary workers and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers of Xi'an Region held a grand meeting to celebrate the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of Xi'an Region.

The Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a telegram of congratulations to the congress, greatly encouraging the revolutionary workers of Xi'an Region.

The responsible comrades of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Group, Huang Jingyao, Hu Wei, Liu Jianrong, Fang Shengpu, and Gu Fengming, as well as the responsible comrades of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Region and the troops stationed in Shaanxi, attended the celebration. Representatives from the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary United Front Consultative Conference, representatives from the Shaanxi Provincial Red Guards of Higher Education Institutions, and representatives from the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xi'an Region all attended to express their warm congratulations.

The successful establishment of the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of Xi'an Region is a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a fruitful result of the Xi'an Region proletariat fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Over the past year, the proletariat of Xi'an Region, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, fought side by side with the revolutionary Red Guards, thoroughly criticizing and repudiating the counter-revolutionary revisionist Khrushchev and his agents in the Northwest and Shaanxi Region, completely shattering their plot to restore capitalism in the Northwest and Shaanxi Region, and making significant contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China were conveyed, the proletariat of Xi'an Region was greatly inspired. They followed the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support troops, took "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Revise and Criticize Revisionism" as the key, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, resolutely struck down bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and first established the Revolutionary United Front Consultative Representatives' Congress in Xi'an Region. In recent times, representatives from revolutionary mass organizations of both factions in many factories have come together to criticize and repudiate themselves, engage in self-criticism, further promote the unity of the proletariat's thoughts, and turn the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions into a magnificent mass movement. The drums celebrating the achievement of revolutionary unity resonate day and night, and various factories and enterprises are establishing revolutionary committees. The rapid development of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination at the grassroots level has laid a solid foundation for the establishment of the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of Xi'an Region, and has also powerfully promoted the development of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination on various fronts in Shaanxi Region.

The chairman of the congress reviewed the battle journey of the revolutionary workers of Xi'an Region over the past year. He hoped that the proletariat of Xi'an Region would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, redouble their efforts, strive to be the best, and continue to make progress. They should strive for comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

Hu Wei, speaking at the meeting, on behalf of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Group, the Shaanxi Provincial Military Region, and all the soldiers and officers of the troops stationed in Shaanxi, extended warm congratulations to the congress. He hoped that the glorious proletariat of Xi'an would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, with the greatest determination, the highest enthusiasm, and the strongest will, earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage and a new level. They should fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, develop and consolidate revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, quickly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, and be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at all times. They should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline, oppose anarchism, consciously observe labor discipline, ensure greater development of industrial production in Xi'an Region in 1968, and achieve a double harvest of revolution and production.

The congress, amidst enthusiastic cheers and applause, passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao. The meeting also passed a letter to the people of the entire province and a resolution on fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    西安地区革命工人代表大会光荣诞生
    中央文革致电热烈祝贺。西安地区革命职工代表和人民解放军指战员隆重集会，欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的辉煌胜利
    据新华社西安二十六日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在全国军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，西安地区革命工人代表大会正式宣告成立。二月二十五日，西安地区革命职工代表和人民解放军指战员隆重集会，热烈庆祝西安地区革命工人代表大会的光荣诞生。
    中央文革给大会发来了贺电，给西安地区广大革命工人以极大的鼓舞。
    人民解放军陕西省支左委员会负责人黄经耀、胡炜、刘建功、方升普、谷凤鸣，以及陕西省军区和驻陕西部队负责人参加了庆祝大会。陕西省革命大联合协商会议代表、陕西省大专院校红代会代表和西安地区贫下中农代表等，都到会热烈祝贺。
    西安地区革命工人代表大会的胜利诞生，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是西安地区工人阶级全面落实毛主席最新指示的丰硕成果。一年多来，西安地区工人阶级怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，和革命的红卫兵小将并肩战斗，大造中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西北地区和陕西省的代理人的反，彻底摧毁了他们妄图在西北地区和陕西省复辟资本主义的阴谋，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了贡献。伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的一系列最新指示传来后，西安地区工人阶级受到极大的鼓舞。他们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，在西安地区首先成立了革命工人大联合协商代表会。最近以来，许多工厂两派对立的革命群众组织代表通过在一起亮私斗私，争做自我批评，进一步促进了工人阶级思想上的团结，使全面落实毛主席的最新指示形成了波澜壮阔的群众运动。庆祝实现革命大联合的锣鼓声日夜震响，各工厂企业纷纷建立革命委员会。基层单位革命大联合和革命三结合的迅速发展，为西安地区革命工人代表大会的成立奠定了牢固的基础，同时也有力地推动了陕西地区各条战线革命大联合和革命三结合的发展。
    大会主席在讲话中回顾了一年多来西安地区革命工人的战斗历程。他希望西安地区工人阶级要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    胡炜在会上讲话时，代表人民解放军陕西省支左委员会、陕西省军区和驻陕部队全体指战员向大会表示热烈祝贺，并希望光荣的西安工人阶级更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以最大的决心，最高的热情，最强的毅力，切实学好毛泽东思想，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段，提高到一个更新的水平；要全面落实毛主席的最新指示，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，迅速开展本单位的斗批改，时刻警惕阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋活动；要坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，反对无政府主义，自觉遵守劳动纪律，保证一九六八年西安地区工业生产的更大发展，夺取革命、生产双丰收。
    大会在热烈的欢呼声和掌声中通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。会议还通过了告全省人民书和关于全面落实毛主席最新指示、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的决议。
