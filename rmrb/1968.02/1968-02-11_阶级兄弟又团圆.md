In the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.

	Mao Zedong

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It was you who, at a critical moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pointed the way for the working class. You taught us: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Many revolutionary workers, upon hearing your words, quickly raised their class consciousness and consciously cut off the poisonous snake of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism that had wrapped around them, increasing their vigilance against the class enemy's plot to sow discord.

This poisonous snake of factionalism wrapped around the bodies of class brothers, bringing smiles to the faces of all class enemies who sought to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from within and without. The old workers of Tianjin's San Tiao Shi have a deep understanding of this.

In the San Tiao Shi Old Workers' United Criticism and Struggle Group, there were two old workers who had been through thick and thin for over twenty years. One was named Zhang Congshuang, and the other was Li Yunchuan. Both were old workers in the casting and molding workshop of the San Tiao Shi Flour Machinery Factory. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these two close class brothers joined different revolutionary mass organizations within the factory. Due to the influence and poisoning of the bourgeois reactionary line and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, they fought an "internal war" for a year. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they deeply felt the harm caused by the bourgeois reactionary line and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism through recalling their class struggles.

Over twenty years ago, two children from poor peasant families in Jiahe County, Hebei Province, came to Tianjin's San Tiao Shi. A fourteen-year-old went to "Xiangli Gong" Foundry to apprentice, which was Zhang Congshuang, whom everyone called Zhang Da. The other, fifteen years old, went to "Yongmao" Pig Iron Factory to apprentice, which was Li Yunchuan, whom everyone called Li Er. The two factories were very close, and they drank water from the same well. When fetching water, they often met and helped each other.

At that time, being an apprentice away from home, meeting a fellow villager was like seeing a family member. The factory rules stated, "No leaving the factory without reason" and "No bringing outsiders into the factory"; apprentices could not see their parents even if they were not yet out of their apprenticeship. But Zhang Da and Li Er met almost every day at the small well. If one day they did not meet, both would feel anxious.

Once, Zhang Da suddenly did not see Li Er fetch water for several days, which really worried him. He picked up the water bucket and ran to "Yongmao." Just as he reached the factory gate, he saw the capitalist pacing back and forth in the courtyard, so he had to wait. After a while, Zhang Da found an opportunity to sneak in. Li Er was alone, lying on the dark loft, his foot burned by molten iron, crying in pain. Zhang Da took a closer look and saw that Li Er's left foot was wrapped in a piece of old cloth. He immediately understood why Li Er had not fetched water for several days. The two burst into tears as soon as they saw each other. Zhang Da saw Li Er's burned foot, which was already infected and rotting, with two toes fused together. He found some old paper, carefully wiped off the pus and blood, and then soaked the fused toes in water to separate them, placing old paper between them....

Li Er saw that he had been there for a while and pointed to the water bucket, asking, "Did you come to fetch water? Hurry up and leave!" Zhang Da hurriedly said to Li Er, "Take care of yourself! I'll come to see you when I have time." Saying this, he quickly ran back. Who knew that the capitalist had been waiting at the door with a willow switch, and as soon as he saw Zhang Da, he cursed, "Did you go to the underworld to fetch water? Why did you come back alive?" He swung the willow switch at Zhang Da without aiming. Fortunately, the workers and fellow apprentices in the courtyard saw that he would be beaten to death if this continued, so they rushed over to protect Zhang Da. The capitalist then threw down the switch and walked away, cursing.

Half a month passed, and Li Er could barely walk again, but he was forced to work. The two toes that Zhang Da had separated with old paper eventually fused together again, just like these two class brothers who had grown up together on the same root of bitterness, inseparable from each other.

After liberation, they were merged into one factory. On the day of the merger, they both shed tears of joy, fulfilling their long-held wish. That night, they lay together, recalling the bitter past and discussing the sweet taste of liberation for the first time. They still remember what they said that night, and the sentence they remember most clearly and will never forget is: "It is the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who brought us together. We must never forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

Soon, they were both assigned to the casting and molding workshop and elected as group leaders. From then on, they not only competed in production and worked together on technological innovations but also studied culture together and fought against the capitalists....

They both had boundless love for Chairman Mao and the Party. In every political movement, they were at the forefront, never having any disagreements. It was not until the Four Cleanups movement that, when the work team executed the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," they had their first differing opinions. Li Yunchuan could not understand the reactionary line executed by the work team. His mind was like a boiling pot of water, and during work, he discussed his views on the work team with Zhang Congshuang. Zhang Congshuang said, "Cloud River, have you forgotten what we said on the night we merged?" Li Yunchuan said, "No, I haven't." Zhang Congshuang continued, "Do you know who the work team represents?" Before Zhang Congshuang could finish, Li Yunchuan interrupted, "Everyone should listen to Chairman Mao's words, but why does the work team do the opposite? Chairman Mao said that the Four Cleanups target a small number of capitalists within the Party, but why does our factory's work team target the masses?" Zhang Congshuang thought for a moment and said, "That's true, but haven't you heard the report? The work team represents the Party! Without the Communist Party, where would we be?..."

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although the Four Cleanups work team had left the factory, the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line still existed. Later, two revolutionary mass organizations with "different viewpoints" were established within the factory: "Constructive Alliance" and "Red Alliance." "Constructive Alliance" said, "'Red Alliance' is a 'conservative organization' that executes the bourgeois reactionary line and is wrong in its fundamental direction." "Red Alliance" wrote in their big-character posters: "'Constructive Alliance' is a motley crew, doing nothing but beating, smashing, and looting, purely a 'counter-revolutionary' organization."

Li Yunchuan initially joined "Constructive Alliance," while Zhang Congshuang, who was usually not very talkative, joined "Red Alliance." This pair of class brothers who had been together for over twenty years were now separated.

Whenever they met, Li Yunchuan would snap at Zhang Congshuang, "I think you should stop being deceived. You are all becoming obstacles to the Cultural Revolution. Why don't you quickly withdraw from 'Red Alliance'?"

Zhang Congshuang could no longer hold back his anger and retorted, "You go mix with the ghosts and snakes! You're almost a counter-revolutionary!"

These two people, influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line and poisoned by factionalism, mutually accused each other of being enemies. They could no longer drink water from the same well or work together in the same workshop. They could not work together to seize the revolution and promote production, nor could they sit on the same bench to criticize Liu Shaoqi. The poison of the bourgeois reactionary line and petty-bourgeois factionalism had separated them so far...

Despite their differing viewpoints, how could Zhang and Li, the two old workers, forget that it was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who brought them together? Whenever Li Yunchuan saw his fused toes, he couldn't help but think of the past. Naturally, Zhang Congshuang also felt very uncomfortable, recalling over twenty years of shared hardships and inseparability, now seeing each other as thorns in the eye and splinters in the flesh? Especially recalling an incident of casting a roller shell, he still felt a chill. That time, their group was using a centrifugal casting machine to cast a roller shell. Zhang had already poured over three hundred pounds of molten iron at over 1,300 degrees into the shell, but the centrifugal speed changer could not engage the third gear, and the speed could not increase. The molten iron would soon overflow, and if it did, it would be disastrous! The machine would be damaged, the iron would be wasted, the factory would be burned, and these were not to mention, but everyone in the workshop would be lightly injured or seriously killed. Just at this critical moment, Li Yunchuan, disregarding danger, rushed forward and engaged the third gear, increasing the centrifugal speed, and the impending disaster was averted. How could Zhang Congshuang forget Li Yunchuan? He absolutely could not.

Soon, with the help of the stationed troops, the entire factory, through studying the works of Chairman Mao, the core members of the two factions finally sat down and had a three-day heart-to-heart talk. They unified their ideological understanding and directed their struggle against Liu Shaoqi. This news, like wings, flew to every corner of the factory. The highest directive: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution," was broadcast over and over. Working together, Zhang Congshuang and Li Yunchuan heard the broadcast and asked themselves many questions: Is he my friend or my enemy? If he is a friend, we have been "dead opponents" of different viewpoints for a year. If he is an enemy, we are class brothers who have fought side by side in every political movement for over twenty years... In the end, it is still a friend, right! Then who separated us?

Zhang Congshuang thought: It was Liu Shaoqi who threw out the bourgeois reactionary line, striking down a large number and protecting a few. Cloud River rebelled against this, and he was right! At this moment, he went to criticize Liu Shaoqi, and I did not help him with his work. Who would suffer? Who would benefit? Chairman Mao taught us to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," but I... No! I must go and talk to him.

Zhang Congshuang's change of attitude gradually calmed Li Yunchuan down. He covered his head and pondered for several days. Congshuang said to me that Liu Shaoqi was the one who instigated us workers to fight an "internal war." We fought each other, letting him gain the advantage. We must not fall for this villain's trick! There is no fundamental conflict of interest between us. We must have a good talk.

What fundamental contradictions and principled disagreements could there be between them? None, absolutely none. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, they both couldn't sleep or eat for several days. They both thought the same: What fundamental conflict of interest is there between us? What we have is love for the Party and Chairman Mao, love for socialism and communism, hatred for the old society's exploitation system, hatred for the capitalists, and hatred for Liu Shaoqi's restoration of capitalism. In which aspect do our interests differ?

After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, their relationship gradually improved. Once, the factory's kiln suddenly had flames shooting out from the door, burning the wooden windows, and the insulation on the wires was burned off, exposing the copper wires. The fire was about to spread. Li Yunchuan and Zhang Congshuang, without a word, picked up water buckets and ladders and rushed to the roof. Both poured water to extinguish the fire, but the exposed wires encountered water and electrified them. At the moment both were in danger of electric shock, they simultaneously shouted, "Congshuang, there's electricity!" "Cloud River, get away!" Neither cared for themselves. Through the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the two old workers who had been separated for a year were reunited.

That day, the two old workers had a heart-to-heart talk. Zhang Congshuang said, "This year, I understood what the bourgeois reactionary line is, what Liu Shaoqi is up to, and who separated us. Understanding this and that, the most fundamental thing is that I understood that I must always follow Chairman Mao and always listen to Chairman Mao's words. Only then can I have a direction and a clear mind when doing things." Li Yunchuan said, "Right! Right! Without Chairman Mao, we would have been gone long ago! How could we be together?" Saying this, Li Yunchuan raised his left foot, and both of their gazes immediately fell on the fused toes. After a long time, Zhang Congshuang said, "We must never forget the past..."

The great unity of class brothers is a necessity for the revolution, a necessity for the cause of socialism and communism, and a necessity for the Chinese and world proletariat and the broad masses of people. Liu Shaoqi fears our unity the most; the more united we are, the harder his days will be, and his various plots and tricks will be exposed one by one, meeting a shameful failure!

Let us, under the great call of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, overcome factionalism, unite, and fight together against the enemy, welcoming the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    阶级兄弟又团圆
    在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。
                                        毛泽东
    毛主席呀，毛主席！是您在无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，给工人阶级指明了方向。您教导说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突，在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”许多革命职工听了您的话，迅速提高了无产阶级觉悟，自觉地起来斩断了缠在身上的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性这条毒蛇，提高了对阶级敌人的分裂阴谋的警惕性。
    派性这条毒蛇缠在阶级兄弟的身上，笑在一切想从内部和外部破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阶级敌人的心里。对这一点天津市三条石的老工人深有体会。
    在三条石老工人联合批判战斗组里，有两个二十多年患难相处的老工人，一个叫张从霜，一个叫李云川。他俩都是三条石面粉机械厂铸工翻砂车间的老工人。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这对亲密无间的阶级兄弟，分别参加了厂内两个革命群众组织。由于受了资产阶级反动路线和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的毒害和影响，打了一年“内战”。他俩学习了毛主席最新指示后，通过忆阶级苦，对资产阶级反动路线和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的毒害感受最深。
    二十多年前，河北省交河县有两个贫农的孩子，来到天津三条石。十四岁的一个到“祥利公”翻砂厂学徒，这就是张从霜，大伙都叫他张大；另一个十五岁的到“永茂”生铁厂学徒，这就是李云川，大伙叫他李二。“祥利公”和“永茂”两个厂距离很近，都喝同一个水铺的水。打水的时候，他俩常遇到一块，彼此互相帮助，互相关心。
    那时候，学徒在外，能遇上个老乡，真跟见了亲人一样。资本家的厂规上写着“无事不得出厂”，也“不许带外人进厂”；学徒不满期，亲爹娘也不能见面。可张大和李二，在小水铺里几乎每天都见面。如果有一天不见面，两人心里说不上有多么着急。
    有一次，张大突然一连几天没见李二来打水，可真把他急坏了。他提着水壶就往“永茂”跑。刚到厂门口，一看资本家正气势汹汹地在院里转转悠悠，只好等着再说。没多久，张大找了个机会就偷偷溜了进去。李二一个人正躺在暗楼上，脚被铁水烫伤了，疼的直喊。张大走近一看，李二左脚上裹着一团破布，马上就明白他为什么几天没去打水。两人一见面就止不住地流下泪来。张大见李二被烫伤的脚，已经发炎腐烂，有两个脚趾粘连在一块。他找了点毛头纸，一点点擦净脚上的脓血，又把已经粘在一起的两个脚趾头用水浸开，把毛头纸夹上……。李二见他来的时间不短了，就指着水壶问：“打水来的？还不快走！”张大急急忙忙地对李二说：“你好好养着吧！我抽空再来看你。”说着就飞快地跑了回去。谁知资本家拿着一截柳木棍早已在门口等着他了，见了张大就破口大骂：“你上阴曹地府打水去啦，你还活着回来干嘛？”拿着柳木棍没头没脑向张大打来。幸亏在院里干活的师傅、师兄弟们看着照这样下去，非打死不行，就一拥而上去保护张大，资本家才丢下棍子骂骂咧咧走开。
    半个月过去了，李二刚能下地，又被逼着干活。他那两个被张大用毛头纸分开的脚趾头，到底还是长在一块了，就象这一条苦根上成长起来的一对阶级兄弟一样，谁也离不开谁。
    解放后，他俩被合并到一个厂工作。合厂那天他俩都流下了兴奋的眼泪，多少年的愿望实现了。那天晚上他俩躺在一块，一幕一幕地回忆着悲惨的过去，也谈着第一次尝到解放的甜是啥滋味。他俩那天晚上说的话，现在也都还记得，其中记得最清楚，将来也永远不会忘记的一句话是：“这是共产党、毛主席把咱俩合到一块的，说什么也不能忘了共产党，毛主席！”
    两人不久又一同分配到翻砂车间，又都被选为组长。从此，他俩不仅在生产上比着干活，一块搞技术革新，而且一起学文化，一起跟资本家斗争……。
    他俩对毛主席、对党都无限热爱，在历次政治运动中，两人都是走在最前面，从来没有意见分歧。直到四清运动中，驻厂工作队执行了打击一大片、保护一小撮的资产阶级反动路线，他俩才第一次有了不同的观点。李云川对工作队执行的反动路线想不通，脑子里象一锅翻腾着的滚水，在上班的时候和张从霜一边干活，一边谈着他对工作队的看法。张从霜说：“云川 ，你忘了咱俩才合厂那天晚上说的话吧？”李云川说：“没忘。”张从霜又说：“你知道工作队代表谁吗？”李云川没等他说完就接着说：“毛主席的话大家都应该听，为啥工作队干的是另一样呢？毛主席说四清整的是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，怎么咱厂工作队整的净是群众呢？”张从霜想了想说：“话倒是这样说，你没听报告？人家工作队就是代表党啊！要没共产党，哪还有咱？……”
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，四清工作队虽然离开了工厂，但资产阶级反动路线的影响却还存在。以后厂内成立了“造联”和“红联”两个“观点”不同的革命群众组织。“造联”说：“‘红联’是‘保守组织’，执行了资产阶级反动路线，大方向错了。”“红联”大字报上写着：“造联”是乌合之众，干的净是打、砸、抢，纯粹是“反革命”组织。
    李云川一开始就参加了“造联”，平常不大爱说话的张从霜却参加了“红联”。这对相处二十多年的阶级兄弟，竟被分开了。
    他俩见面就顶，李云川没好气地对张从霜说：“我看你别再受蒙蔽了，你们都成了文化大革命的绊脚石，还不赶快退出‘红联’？”
    张从霜再也憋不住火了，冲着李云川就是一句：“你和牛鬼蛇神一块混吧！不当反革命也差不离！”
    这两个人，受了资产阶级反动路线的影响和派性的毒害，互相无限上纲。谁对谁也看不顺眼。过去同喝一个水铺的水，现在连在一个车间里干活喝一个桶里的清凉饮料都不行了。抓革命，促生产不能一齐搞，连批判中国赫鲁晓夫都不能坐在一条板凳上。资产阶级反动路线的流毒和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的毒害把他们分的多远啊……
    尽管“观点”分歧，张、李两位老工人怎能忘记是毛主席、共产党把他俩合到一起的呢！每当李云川看见自己那对长在一起的脚趾头，心里总不免要想起过去。自然，张从霜心里也十分不是滋味，二十多年患难与共，难分难离，今天却视为眼中钉，肉中刺？特别是想起一次浇铸辊子胎的事来，现在还心有余悸。那次他们组正用离心浇铸机浇铸辊子胎，张师傅已经把一千三百多度滚沸的铁水往胎里倒了三百多斤，可是，离心变速箱就是挂不上三挡，转速再上不去，滚沸的铁水马上就会冒出来，当真冒出来，那可就糟啦！机器损坏，铁水浪费，厂房被烧，这些都不说，可满车间里的人就要轻的重伤，重的丧命。正在这千钧一发的紧急关头，李云川不顾一切，冒着生命危险，一步抢了上去，挂上了三挡，离心机转速上去了，一场就要发生的大祸免除了。张从霜怎能忘了李云川呢？根本不能。
    不久，全厂在驻军的帮助下，通过对毛主席著作的学习，两派核心终于坐下来开了三天谈心会，他们统一了思想认识，把斗争矛头直接指向了中国赫鲁晓夫。这消息象插了翅膀，飞到全厂各个角落。最高指示：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”一遍一遍地在播送着。一块干活的张从霜和李云川听到了广播，都互相给自己提出许许多多的问题：他到底是我的朋友，还是我的敌人？是朋友，一年来，我们是两个“观点”的“死对头”。是敌人，我们是二十多年的阶级兄弟，各个政治运动中都并肩战斗，好的象一个人……总归还是朋友，对！哪又是谁把我们分开的呢？
    张从霜想：是中国赫鲁晓夫抛出资产阶级反动路线，打击一大片，保护一小撮，云川看不过才造的反，反的对！当下，他去批判中国赫鲁晓夫，我不替他干活，到底谁吃亏？对谁有利？毛主席教导我们“要斗私，批修”，可我……不行！非找他去说说不可。
    张从霜态度的转变使李云川也慢慢冷静下来。他捂着脑袋琢磨了好几天，从霜冲我说的那些话，分明是中国赫鲁晓夫挑动我们工人打“内战”，我们斗来斗去，斗自己，反叫他得了便宜，不能上这坏蛋的当！我们之间没有根本利害冲突，非好好谈谈不可。
    他们之间到底有什么解决不了的矛盾和原则的分歧呢？没有，根本没有。毛主席的最新指示发出后，他俩都好几天睡不着觉，吃不下饭。他俩想的都是一样，我们之间有什么根本的利害冲突？我们之间有的就是对党对毛主席的爱，对社会主义共产主义的爱，对旧社会剥削制度的恨，对资本家的恨，对中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的恨，哪一点利害都一样。
    他俩学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，关系慢慢改善了。有一次，厂里熏窑突然由窑门窜出火苗子，把木窗烧着了，电线皮烧掉了，铜丝裸露在外，眼看火头子起来了。李云川、张从霜没说二话，提水桶、搬梯子，都急忙上了房顶。两个人都泼水救火，哪知裸露的电线遇水电人。在两人一齐碰到触电危险的时刻，同时喊了一句：“从霜有电！”“云川躲开！”谁也没顾自己。通过毛主席最新指示的全面落实，分开了一年的两位老工人，又合到一起了。
    这天，两位老工人一块谈心，张从霜说：“这一年我懂得了什么叫资产阶级反动路线，懂得了中国赫鲁晓夫到底搞的是什么鬼，也知道了咱俩是谁给分开的。懂了这，懂了那，最根本的就是我懂了必须永远紧跟毛主席，永远听毛主席的话，干起事来才有方向，心里才亮堂。”李云川说：“对！对！要没毛主席，咱俩早就没啦！哪还能到一块。”说着，说着，李云川抬起左脚，两人目光一下就都盯在那对长在一块的脚趾头上。过了好大一会，张从霜说：“千万不能忘记过去呀！……”
    阶级兄弟的大联合，是革命的需要，是社会主义和共产主义事业的需要，是中国和全世界无产阶级和广大人民的需要。中国赫鲁晓夫最怕我们的团结；我们越是团结起来，他的日子就越不好过，他的一切阴谋诡计就会一个个被揭穿，遭到可耻失败！
    让我们在毛主席的最新指示的伟大召唤下，打倒派性，团结起来，共同对敌，迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利吧！
