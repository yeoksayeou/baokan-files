Laotian patriotic military and civilians hold rally to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory at Na Bo and the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam
Firmly stand with the Vietnamese people to fight shoulder to shoulder and thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism
Laotian patriotic neutral forces' troops and agencies celebrate the glorious victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam

KANGO, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, representatives from various departments of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, mass organizations, and units of the People's Liberation Army held a rally in Sam Neua on February 9 to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory at Na Bo and the Tet Offensive by the military and civilians of South Vietnam.

Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Sithon Komadam, and Central Committee members Sanan, Lofa, Meosu, Kamphe Boupha, Sisana Sisane, and Kamping Boupha attended the rally.

Kansou Khoula, Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao Three-Party National Unity Government, also attended the rally.

Sanan delivered a speech at the rally. He said that the victory at Na Bo has shattered the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to attack the Upper Laos region, undermine the patriotic forces of Laos, threaten the western part of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and expand the war of aggression in Indochina. He emphasized that the victory at Na Bo is of great significance in the complete annihilation of the enemy's combat power. It marks the growth of the Lao patriotic armed forces in tactics, technology, and command level, demonstrating the invincible power of the people's war.

Sanan also enthusiastically celebrated the glorious victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam since the beginning of the year. He said that the strong offensive by the South Vietnamese military and civilians in the early spring has dealt a thunderous blow to the U.S. imperialists' lackeys in South Vietnam—the Saigon puppet army and government.

He pointed out that the glorious victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and civilians have laid a solid foundation for thoroughly defeating the 120,000 U.S. puppet troops and their mercenaries, liberating South Vietnam, and unifying Vietnam.

He stressed that the great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and civilians have greatly inspired the patriotic military and civilians of Laos and created very favorable conditions for the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Lao people.

Sanan said: U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will not accept defeat. Undoubtedly, they will continue to use various tricks to sabotage the liberation struggles of the Lao people and the Vietnamese people. Therefore, the Lao people and the Vietnamese people must further strengthen their unity and fight shoulder to shoulder. We are firmly convinced that as long as the Lao people and the Vietnamese people are closely united, resolutely fight, and are not afraid of sacrifice, they will surely achieve the final victory, and U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will suffer a thorough defeat.

The rally adopted a resolution calling on the patriotic military and civilians of Laos to strengthen and build revolutionary forces, promote combat and production development, and build liberated areas to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism and its Lao lackeys.

KANGO, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from troops and agencies of the Laotian patriotic neutral forces recently held a rally in Kango to enthusiastically celebrate the glorious victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam since the beginning of the year.

A resolution adopted at the rally stated: The military and civilians of South Vietnam have firmly grasped the initiative of the war, continuously advancing to victory, and have beaten the extremely cruel and barbaric U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to a pulp. The Laotian patriotic neutral forces enthusiastically celebrate this great victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilians.

The resolution said: The Laotian patriotic neutral forces regard the victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians as their own victories. Because this victory is a great encouragement to us Laotian people, especially to our patriotic neutral forces, making us more courageous in fighting the enemy and achieving greater victories.

The resolution expressed: The Laotian patriotic neutral forces will firmly strengthen their close unity with the Lao Patriotic Front and are determined to fight alongside the brotherly Vietnamese people to the end in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.
