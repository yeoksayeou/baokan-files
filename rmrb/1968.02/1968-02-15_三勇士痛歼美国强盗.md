Three Heroes Decisively Defeat American Aggressors

In the province of Tuy Hoa, in the border district of Ben Cat, in the commune of Phu An, a three-person guerrilla squad, displaying a fearless spirit of sacrifice, fought bravely for a whole day and routed a battalion of American invaders, annihilating 159 American aggressors. This once again exposed the paper tiger nature of American imperialism.

On the morning of December 21 last year, at seven o'clock, a battalion of American troops launched a "sweep" operation against the first village in Phu An. The enemy first used aircraft and artillery to bombard and clear the way for their advance, then cautiously pushed forward. At this time, the guerrilla squad leader Ad, along with Am and Afu, were already in position. They waited until the enemy was only 15 meters away from their position before opening fire. A batch of enemy soldiers fell, and the entire battalion of American troops was thrown into chaos by the fierce firepower of the guerrilla squad.

At 9:30, the American devils counterattacked, but they were again repulsed by the brave guerrillas.

The increasingly fierce battle continued until noon. The guerrilla squad quickly annihilated an American artillery squad and captured an enemy recoilless rifle. In the afternoon, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, the enemy launched two more attacks, but they were all repulsed by the increasingly fierce guerrillas. By 5:00 PM, the entire battalion of American troops had been routed and had to retreat in disarray, dragging away more than a hundred corpses.

Under the inspiration of victory, Ad, Am, and Afu, forgetting the fatigue of a day's battle, decided to press their advantage and deliver another heavy blow to the enemy. They cleverly infiltrated the enemy's base and, when the enemy was gathering for a meal, launched a sudden attack, killing and wounding 60 more enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy troops were terrified and fled in panic.

Ad's guerrilla squad, displaying a spirit of fearlessness and tenacious fighting, finally routed a battalion of American troops and returned to their base with glorious results. (New China News Agency, according to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam)

    三勇士痛歼美国强盗
    越南南方土龙木省边葛县富安乡一个三人游击小组，发扬不怕牺牲的精神，经过一天无比英勇的战斗，把一个营的美国侵略军打得溃不成军，歼灭美国强盗一百五十九名，使美帝国主义又一次现出了纸老虎的原形。
    去年十二月二十一日早上七时，一营美军向富安乡第一村发动“扫荡”。敌人先用飞机大炮进行狂轰滥炸来为他们掩护和开路，然后胆颤心惊地向前推进。这时候，游击小组组长阿德和阿明、阿福等三人，早已严阵以待。他们等敌人进入离自己阵地只有十五米的地方才开火。一批敌人应声倒下，整个营的美军被游击小组的猛烈火力打得前仆后仰，狼狈不堪。
    九点三十分，美国鬼子进行反扑，但是，他们又被英勇的游击队击退。
    越来越激烈的战斗，一直继续到正午。游击小组很快地全歼了美国侵略军的一个炮兵班。并且缴获了敌人的一门无后座力炮。下午，敌人在飞机大炮的掩护下，又先后发动两次进攻。但都被越战越勇的游击队击退。到五点钟的时候，全营美军已被打得溃不成军，不得不拖着上百具尸体狼狈地撤回驻地。
    阿德、阿明和阿福在胜利的鼓舞下，忘记了一天战斗的劳累，决心乘胜再给敌人以沉重的打击。他们机智地潜入敌人驻地，趁敌人正在集合吃饭的时候，以迅雷不及掩耳之势猛袭敌人，当场打死打伤敌人六十名。吓得残敌魂不附体，慌忙逃命。
    阿德的游击小组发扬了不怕牺牲、顽强战斗的精神，终于击溃了一个营的美军，带着辉煌的战果，安然回到了根据地。（新华社据越南南方解放通讯社）
