The nationwide situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before. In a few more months, the situation will be even better.

The great splendor of Mao Zedong Thought shines over the South China Sea. The Revolutionary Committees of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City are simultaneously born in victory.

Sixty million soldiers and civilians in Guangzhou and people from all over the province held meetings to sincerely wish for the eternal life of the great leader Chairman Mao!

The establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee has greatly consolidated and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, shattering the dream of restoring capitalism by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu in Guangdong. This is a heavy blow to the spies of the U.S., Chiang Kai-shek, Britain, Japan, and Soviet revisionism, and various reactionary forces in the world. It is a powerful support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America and the struggle against British imperialism by the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The 40 million heroic sons and daughters are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to overcome factionalism, strengthen unity, and build an iron Great Wall of the South China Sea.

In the invincible light of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the midst of the nationwide call to arms for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another triumphant song resounds from the southern part of the motherland: the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee have been born in victory amidst the stormy class struggle!

The birth of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! It declares the complete failure of the evil plot by the Chinese Khrushchev, the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, and their agents in Guangdong, such as Zhao Ziyang, to restore capitalism in Guangdong. The proletarian dictatorship on the national defense front in the south has been greatly consolidated and strengthened after more than a year of tempering in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, dealing a heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, as well as all class enemies within the country.

Our dearest and most beloved Red Sun, Chairman Mao, has always been deeply concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong. Chairman Mao's warm care and his series of extremely important latest instructions have greatly inspired and given boundless strength to the 40 million revolutionary people of Guangdong. They have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed the course charted by Chairman Mao, and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong.

Red flags flutter over the South China Sea, and drums and gongs resound along the Pearl River. On February 21, more than 600,000 people from all regions, counties, and fronts of the province, as well as revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, gathered from all directions at the central venue on Yuexiu Hill and various sub-venues. Carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao, holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and singing "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," they enthusiastically celebrated the birth of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The celebration began with the orchestra playing the majestic "The East Is Red." When the conference solemnly announced the birth of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause, cannon salutes, drumming, and gongs. People repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

On that day, from Nanling to Wuzhishan, from the Chaozhou and Shantou plains to the Pearl River Delta, all prefectures, counties, and communes in the province held celebration meetings. The 40 million heroic sons and daughters sincerely wished, "Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

For more than a decade since liberation, Guangdong Province has been a battleground of intense struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. The Chinese Khrushchev, the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, and their agents in Guangdong have attempted to restore capitalism in Guangdong, pushing the revisionist counter-revolutionary line on all fronts and committing heinous crimes. During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they used their usurped power to brutally suppress the revolutionary cadres and masses, creating a white terror and attempting to extinguish the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"In June, the heavenly troops march to eliminate evil, with a thousand-foot rope to capture the rocs." The heroic sons and daughters of the south, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, they raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, displayed great revolutionary spirit, launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev, the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, and their agents in Guangdong, bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, smashed the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, defeated all the evil plots of the class enemies, exposed and criticized Tao Zhu and other small cliques of capitalist roaders within the party, and seized back the power they had usurped into the hands of the revolutionary cadres.

"Without a people's army, there would be no people's everything." The broad officers and soldiers of the Guangzhou garrison of the People's Liberation Army resolutely responded to the great call of the great commander-in-chief Mao Zedong, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." They firmly stood with the revolutionary cadres, fought together, and followed the great strategic deployments of Chairman Mao. They resolutely implemented the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, armed the revolutionary cadres and broad revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and established immortal merits in the "three supports, two militaries" work.

Guangdong is on the national defense front, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, and the class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. The spies of the U.S., Chiang Kai-shek, Soviet revisionism, Britain, and Japan, and reactionary forces from various countries are constantly attempting to sabotage our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, together with the revolutionary cadres and masses of the entire province, followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "Never forget class struggle," raised high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," closely united, and remained highly vigilant, building an iron Great Wall along the South China Sea.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration meeting. He said that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Guangdong region has rapidly advanced to a new stage. Currently, the revolutionary situation in Guangdong is excellent, with industry and agriculture booming and revolutionary scenes everywhere. Comrade Huang Yongsheng said that after the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the most fundamental task is to take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, establish Mao Zedong Thought, and always place the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Setting up study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." We must make the greatest efforts and use the greatest strength to set up more and better study classes of various types of Mao Zedong Thought, unify the thoughts of the people of the entire province with Mao Zedong Thought, occupy all positions in the province with Mao Zedong Thought, and turn Guangdong Province into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng emphasized that we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At present, one measure of whether the study of Mao Zedong Thought is good or not is whether we can use the most sharp weapon of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and overcome anarchist trends, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. The enemy uses factionalism, and factionalism covers up the enemy. This is a new feature of the current class struggle. All revolutionary comrades must strengthen their awareness of class struggle, heighten vigilance, sharpen their eyes, resolutely cut off the black hands, overthrow factionalism, unite as one, and fight against the enemy together.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng said that the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasp the revolutionary direction of struggle, continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. We must further criticize and purge all the poisonous influences spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu and their agents in the Guangdong region. We must reform education, reform literature and art, reform office work and administrative management work, and reform all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, thoroughly criticize the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev, rectify the party organization, and strengthen party building. We must better implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution, promoting production, promoting work, and promoting preparedness," and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Comrade Huang Yongsheng said that we must further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," be vigilant against the class enemies' attempts to sow discord between the army and the people, and strengthen military-civilian unity. The entire province's military and civilians must heighten vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen preparedness, be ready at any time to smash the war provocations of American imperialism and its running dogs, smash all the evil plots of the class enemies to carry out sabotage activities, and further support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America and the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon's struggle against British imperialism, defend the great motherland, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Liu Xingyuan, a responsible comrade of the Guangzhou garrison, spoke on behalf of the leading organs and all officers and soldiers of the Guangzhou garrison at the celebration meeting. He said that the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee is of great significance for strengthening national defense and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a heavy blow to American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Kuomintang bandits, and powerful support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America and the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon's struggle against British imperialism. He emphasized that the officers and soldiers of the three services of the Guangzhou garrison must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, "The rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." We will resolutely maintain the proletarian authority of the revolutionary committee, be a strong backbone for the revolutionary committee, and resolutely smash all the sabotage activities of the class enemies. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," further implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work and the work of loving the people, and fight side by side with the revolutionary cadres and broad revolutionary masses of Guangdong Province, ready at any time to smash the war provocations of American imperialism and its running dogs.

Comrade Huang Ronghai, vice chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and Comrade Wang Shoudao, vice chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, also spoke at the celebration meeting.

Representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City expressed their revolutionary enthusiasm at the celebration meeting and unanimously declared that they would, under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They would take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, genuinely set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, resolutely resist and overcome anarchist trends, continuously consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, carry out revolutionary great criticism in depth and over a long period, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They would heighten vigilance a hundredfold, guard against the sabotage activities of all class enemies at home and abroad, forever unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight together, and win together!

Comrade Kong Shiquan, first vice chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and vice chairmen Chen Yu, Qiu Guoguang, Yan Zhongchuan, Liu Jifa, and Huang Yuying, vice chairmen of the Guangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee Yang Zhen, Jiao Linyi, Zhang Rongting, Sun Yiwu, and Zhong Shuben, and members of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou and the Guangdong Military Region, attended the celebration meeting.

The delegation of patriotic compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau congratulating the establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee also attended the celebration meeting and delivered a congratulatory speech.

The celebration meeting, in the midst of extremely enthusiastic applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

The meeting ended in victory with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    广东省和广州市革命委员会同时胜利诞生
    广州六十万军民、全省各地群众分别举行大会，衷心祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    广东省革命委员会的成立，极大地巩固和加强了无产阶级专政，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及反革命两面派陶铸在广东复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。这是对美、蒋、英、日、苏修特务和各国反动势力的沉重打击，是对越南人民抗美救国战争、港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的有力支援。四千万英雄儿女决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，打倒派性，增强团结，筑起钢铁般的南海长城
    新华社广州二十二日电　在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的号角声中，祖国南方传来了又一曲凯歌：广东省革命委员会和广州市革命委员会，在阶级斗争的暴风骤雨中同时胜利诞生了！
    广东省革命委员会和广州市革命委员会的诞生，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！它宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫、反革命两面派陶铸以及他们在广东省的代理人赵紫阳等党内一小撮走资派，妄图在广东省复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋彻底破产。祖国南方国防前线的无产阶级专政，经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，得到了极大的巩固和加强，这对于帝、修、反和国内一切阶级敌人是一个沉重的打击。
    我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席，一直非常关心广东省的无产阶级文化大革命运动。毛主席的亲切关怀和毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示，给了广东四千万革命人民以巨大的鼓舞，无穷的力量。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，按照毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进，夺得了广东省无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    南海之滨红旗招展，珠江岸边锣鼓喧天。二月二十一日，来自全省各地区、各县市、各条战线的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和中国人民解放军驻广州部队指战员共六十多万人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》，从四面八方涌向越秀山中心会场和各个分会场，热烈庆祝广东省革命委员会和广州市革命委员会胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在乐队高奏雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。大会庄严宣告广东省革命委员会和广州市革命委员会胜利诞生时，全场掌声雷动，礼炮齐鸣，锣鼓喧天，人们一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    这一天，从南岭到五指山，从潮汕平原到珠江三角洲，全省各专区、县、人民公社也分别举行了庆祝大会。四千万英雄儿女衷心祝愿：“我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    解放十几年来，广东省一直存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫、反革命两面派陶铸及其在广东的代理人，妄图在广东省复辟资本主义，在各条战线上疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，犯下了滔天罪行。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们又凭借所窃取的职权，疯狂镇压无产阶级革命派和革命群众，制造白色恐怖，妄图扑灭无产阶级文化大革命的烈火。
　  “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的祖国南方的英雄儿女，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬大无畏的革命精神，向中国赫鲁晓夫、反革命两面派陶铸及其在广东的代理人，发动了猛烈的进攻，英勇地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖，击败了阶级敌人的一切罪恶阴谋，揭发和批判了陶铸等党内一小撮走资派，把他们所窃取的权力夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”中国人民解放军广州部队广大指战员坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，坚定地和无产阶级革命派团结、战斗在一起。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决执行支左不支派的原则，用毛主席的最新指示武装无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在“三支”“两军”工作中建立了不朽的功勋。
    广东地处国防前线，毗邻港澳，阶级斗争十分尖锐、复杂，美蒋、苏修、英日特务和各国反动势力每时每刻企图从这里破坏我国的无产阶级文化大革命。人民解放军广大指战员和全省无产阶级革命派、革命群众一道，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，高举“拥军爱民”的光辉旗帜，紧密团结，百倍警惕，在祖国南海之滨筑起了一道钢铁长城。
    广东省革命委员会主任黄永胜同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，广东地区无产阶级文化大革命迅速推进到一个新的阶段。目前广东省革命形势一片大好，工农业生产蒸蒸日上，到处都是蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。黄永胜同志说，广东省革命委员会成立以后，最根本的任务，就是要以林彪副主席为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大立毛泽东思想，始终把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”我们一定要下最大的决心，用最大的力量，把各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班办得更多更好，用毛泽东思想统一全省人民的思想，让毛泽东思想占领全省的一切阵地，把广东省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    黄永胜同志强调指出，我们要坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在当前说来，衡量学习毛泽东思想好不好之一，就是能不能用战无不胜的毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器去打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和克服无政府主义思潮，增强无产阶级党性，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。敌人利用派性，派性掩护敌人，这是当前阶级斗争的新特点。一切革命的同志，都要增强阶级斗争观念，提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，坚决斩断黑手，打倒派性，团结一致，共同对敌。
    黄永胜同志说，毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，继续深入地开展革命大批判，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，深入开展本单位的斗、批、改。要进一步批判和肃清中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸及其在广东地区代理人所散布的一切修正主义流毒。要改革教育，改革文艺，改革机关工作和行政管理工作，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设。要更好地贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    黄永胜同志说，我们要进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，警惕阶级敌人挑拨军民关系，大力加强军民团结。全省军民要百倍提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的战争挑衅，粉碎一切阶级敌人进行破坏活动的罪恶阴谋，进一步支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争和港九爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争，保卫伟大的祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    广州部队负责人刘兴元同志代表广州部队领导机关和全体指战员在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，广东省革命委员会的成立，对加强国防，加强无产阶级专政，具有十分重要的意义。这是对美帝、苏修和蒋匪帮的沉重打击，是对越南人民抗美救国战争的有力支援，是对港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的有力支援。他强调指出：我们广州部队陆海空三军指战员一定要牢记毛主席的教导：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”我们坚决维护革命委员会的无产阶级权威，誓做革命委员会的坚强后盾，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋破坏活动。我们坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，进一步贯彻执行支左不支派的原则，做好“三支”“两军”工作和爱民工作，誓与广东省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众并肩战斗，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的战争挑衅。
    广东省革命委员会副主任、广州市革命委员会主任黄荣海同志，广东省革命委员会副主任王首道同志，也在庆祝大会上讲了话。
    广东省和广州市革命工人、贫下中农和红卫兵小将的代表，满怀革命激情，在庆祝大会上一致表示：要在广东省革命委员会和广州市革命委员会的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。要以“斗私，批修”为纲，切实办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，坚决抵制和克服无政府主义思潮，不断巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，深入持久地开展革命大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。要百倍提高警惕，严防国内外一切阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，永远和中国人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    广东省革命委员会第一副主任孔石泉同志，副主任陈郁、邱国光、阎仲川、刘继发、黄育英同志，广州市革命委员会副主任阳震、焦林义、张荣亭、孙亦武、钟叙本同志和省、市革命委员会的委员们，中国人民解放军驻广州部队和广东省军区的负责同志，参加了庆祝大会。
