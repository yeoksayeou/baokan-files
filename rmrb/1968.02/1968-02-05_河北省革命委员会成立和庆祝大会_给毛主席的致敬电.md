The wind and rain bring spring, and the falling snow welcomes its arrival. The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is on the verge of a new spring, a spring of battle, and a spring of even greater triumph.

Today, the 43 million heroic sons and daughters of Hebei, standing guard by your side, are filled with boundless joy and infinite affection. We joyfully report to you, our dearest and most beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao, that the Hebei Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory under your deep concern and guidance, under your latest instructions, and under the call to achieve a complete victory in the Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Thunder roars across the plains of Yan and Zhao, and the entire North China region is red. The establishment of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee has turned the entire North China region into a sea of red. This is a great victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the heartland of our great socialist motherland. This victory will certainly make the overall situation in the country even better, and the torrent of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution will surge forward even more irresistibly!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Look, within the Great Wall, red flags are everywhere; along the Hai River, the sea of people is vast. On this day of great joy and triumph, with the songs of victory ringing out and the masses rejoicing, how can we, the heroic sons and daughters of Hebei, not be moved to tears of joy and have our hearts pounding with emotion? We have so much to say to you, and so many songs of praise to sing. The vast waters of the Bohai Sea cannot contain your deep affection for us; the towering Taihang Mountains cannot bear the weight of our boundless love for you. A thousand words and a thousand songs all merge into the strongest voice of the times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live Chairman Mao! We wish you eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! On this joyous occasion, how can the people of Hebei, who have endured so many battles, forget the years of struggle you led us through, and how can we forget the long journey we have taken with you!

Dear Chairman Mao, it was you who, at the critical moment of the Chinese nation's life and death, led the Red Army northward and ignited the flames of resistance against Japan. It was you who armed us with the brilliant ideas of people's war. Mothers sent their sons to fight the Japanese, and wives sent their husbands to the battlefield. Everyone fought bravely. On the Taihang Mountains, in the marshes of Baiyangdian, in the green fields, and in the tunnels, countless heroic sons and daughters wove a net of guerrilla warfare, creating an epic of unparalleled grandeur. Finally, together with the people of all the liberated areas, they burned and destroyed the Japanese imperialist beast, achieving a great victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan!

Dear Chairman Mao, it was you who, with unparalleled courage and genius in history, commanded the great War of Liberation. Following the great victory at Qingfeng Store, you commanded us to quickly capture Shijiazhuang. After the Liaoshen and Huaihai Campaigns, you personally commanded the great Pingjin Campaign, completing the strategic task of decisive battles. From then on, "The wind and rain rise over Mount Zhongshan, and a million heroic troops cross the Yangtze River," burying the Chiang Kai-shek regime and winning the liberation of the entire country!

Dear Chairman Mao, it was you who, on the eve of national victory, convened the historic Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in Xibaipo. With your far-sighted vision, you pointed out to the entire Party and the nation the tasks and paths of transitioning from the New Democratic Revolution to the Socialist Revolution, and timely warned against the attacks of the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie. Your great thought of continuous revolution led the people of the entire country from one victory to another.

Dear Chairman Mao, it was you who initiated the great socialist upsurge in China's rural areas that shocked the world. By the banks of the Zhuo River, the revolutionary action of three poor peasants establishing a commune, you pointed out was "the direction of 500 million peasants"; in the southern foothills of the Yan Mountains, the revolutionary spirit of the "barefoot commune" with only three donkey legs, you praised as "the image of our entire country." The 600 million "barefoot people" of the nation followed the direction you pointed out and stepped onto the broad road of socialism. "The sky connects the Five Ridges with silver hoes falling, and the earth shakes the Three Rivers with iron arms swaying," the great motherland changes, and the mountains and rivers are renewed everywhere!

Dear Chairman Mao, it was you who, in the years of the Great Leap Forward, personally presided over the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Issue of Establishing People's Communes in the Countryside" by the Bohai Sea. With the steps of a giant, you inspected Hebei and traveled throughout the country, "enjoying the spring colors of the world." The rivers and mountains are magnificent, and the three red banners fly forever.

Dear Chairman Mao, it was you who, at a critical moment when the domestic and foreign class enemies were in collusion and the demons were rampant, issuing a counter-revolutionary tide, issued the battle cry of "never forget class struggle" and announced the order for the proletariat to launch a full-scale counterattack against the bourgeoisie, striking back at the arrogant attacks of the class enemies.

Dear Chairman Mao, you are heart to heart with the people of Hebei! In the days and nights when we bravely fought against the once-in-a-century floods, you issued the great call to "definitely control the Hai River" and personally drew the blueprint for changing the heavens and the earth. Now, the rice waves rise in thousands of layers, and the Hai River banks are bathed in morning light! When we suffered the once-in-a-thousand-years earthquake disaster, you sent the people's liberation army, composed of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of ten thousand, to help and encourage us to fight against the heavens and the earth, and strive for self-improvement.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The heavens are great, the earth is great, but your kindness is greater! Father and mother are dear, but you are dearer! Remembering the past, without your wise leadership, how could we, the broad masses of laboring people, escape the depths of suffering? Without your ideological nurturing, how could we become so strong in the battles? Without your correct guidance, how could we avoid so many reefs and cross so many difficulties, from victory to new victories? Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Every step of our progress, every achievement, and every victory is a great victory of your brilliant thoughts! We must forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will be your good soldiers, forever closely following you to build socialism and march towards the bright and glorious future of communism!

"Once the wind and thunder rise from the earth, there will be new life emerging from the piles of white bones." The land of Hebei is filled with the smoke of life-and-death struggles between two classes, two lines, and two roads. Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Hebei Provincial Party Committee colluded and conspired, trying to restore capitalism in Hebei. They spread some black winds and evil fogs, bringing all kinds of black goods such as "getting rich," "three selfs and one package," and "four freedoms" to some places here. The infamous "Taoyuan Experience" was also concocted here and released from here, poisoning various places. They were anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, with ambitious plans and heinous crimes.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You have keen eyes and have seen through the wolfish ambitions of Chinese Khrushchev and his gang of conspirators. With the greatest spirit of a proletarian revolutionary, you personally initiated and led this unprecedented and world-shaking Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the heroic sons and daughters of Hebei, followed your magnificent steps, raised high the banner of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and exposed a handful of capitalist roaders who had long been entrenched in our province. But Chinese Khrushchev did not give up his doom, eagerly throwing out the bourgeois reactionary line, encircling the proletarian revolutionary masses, suppressing the revolutionary masses, and implementing white terror. We resolutely responded to your call to "shell the headquarters," defending your proletarian revolutionary line, navigating through the mist and avoiding the reefs, repelling their repeated counterattacks, and making their plots forever unachievable.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Just as we, with the help of the army, rode the "January Revolution" wind, raised the banners of revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity, a handful of stubborn capitalist roaders in Hebei crawled out again, spreading rumors, sowing discord, confusing right and wrong, creating chaos, and shifting the direction of the struggle. They disrupted your great strategic deployment and even directed their arrows at the People's Liberation Army, which you personally created, and the proletarian headquarters led by you. The revolutionary torrent cannot be stopped, and the wheels of history cannot be turned back! At this crucial moment of victory or defeat, you inspected North China, Central South, and East China, issuing a series of extremely important instructions. Your latest instructions gave us boundless strength, endless wisdom, and limitless courage. Our hearts are redder, our eyes are brighter, our will is firmer, and our courage is greater. In the fierce struggle against the class enemies, we become stronger and stronger, defending your revolutionary line and repelling interference from the right and the ultra-"left." We, together with the great People's Liberation Army of China, are closely united and fight shoulder to shoulder, forming an even more magnificent Great Wall.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Today, the situation in Hebei is excellent and getting better! From the foothills of the Taihang Mountains to the Bohai Sea, from the foot of the Yan Mountains to the end of the Zhang River, the great banner of "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" is waving in the wind, and the waves of revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" are surging. Study classes of your brilliant thoughts are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. The industrial front is reporting victories, and agricultural production has achieved a bumper harvest. The 43 million heroic sons and daughters of Hebei have never been as spirited and determined as they are today; proletarian dictatorship has never been as solid and strong as it is today.

Most beloved Chairman Mao, our Hebei Revolutionary Committee has been born, but "the road ahead is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous." Our work is complex and our tasks are numerous, but arming the broad revolutionary masses with your great thoughts and achieving the ideological transformation of the people is the fundamental and key. We must launch a more thorough and extensive mass movement to study and apply your brilliant thoughts, continue to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and promote a good learning style. With your latest instructions as our guide, with "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as our main task, and with the "Old Five Articles" as our motto, we will carry out a revolution in our souls, thoroughly overthrow the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthen proletarian party spirit. Let the "self" be swept out the door and build a "public" Great Wall. We must make the greatest determination: to turn Hebei into a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

Most beloved Chairman Mao, you taught us: "It is better to use the remaining courage to pursue the fleeing enemy than to seek fame and learn from the king." We must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our province politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination." We must reform education, reform literature and art, reform office work and administrative management. We must rectify the Party organization, strengthen the Party building armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of building the Party. We must let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions!

Most beloved Chairman Mao, "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness" is your great call, and we will resolutely carry it out to the letter. Hebei Province is located in the heart of the motherland and around the world revolutionary center Beijing, a strategic stronghold to defend the proletarian headquarters led by you. We must work hard to do a better job in industrial and agricultural production and all other work, making greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland and supporting the world revolution! We must make the thousand-li plains of Hebei a strong red barrier to defend you and the capital!

Most beloved Chairman Mao, you taught us to "support the army and love the people." We must hold high the banner of supporting the army, believe in and rely on the army more, support and love the army, learn from and help the army, and be highly vigilant against the class enemies' plots to disrupt military-civilian relations and sabotage military-civilian unity. "The unity of the army and the people is like one person; see who can be their enemy?"

Most beloved Chairman Mao, we must follow your teachings and "never forget class struggle," strengthen proletarian dictatorship, consolidate the new revolutionary order, and defend the newly born revolutionary committee. Against a handful of class enemies who brazenly sabotage the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sabotage socialist construction, and disrupt social order, whether in front or behind the scenes, we must fully mobilize the masses, thoroughly investigate, and resolutely strike them down!

The revolutionary river surges forward; the wheels of history roll on. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The world has entered a new era with your brilliant thoughts as the great banner. You are the representative of truth, the dawn of daybreak, the savior of mankind, and the hope of the world. Under your ideological inspiration, the revolutionary future of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world is bright and glorious! We cannot express our boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to you! On this grand occasion, we, the 43 million heroic sons and daughters of Hebei, solemnly swear to you: Our heads may be cut off, and our blood may flow, but your great thoughts will never be abandoned; the sea may dry up, and the stones may rot, but our red hearts loyal to you will never change! Your path, we have decided to follow, and we will forever follow your path with the people of the entire country and the revolutionary people of the world, letting the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shine upon the globe!

Most heartfelt wishes to you, our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, the reddest red sun in our hearts, for eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    河北省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
    给毛主席的致敬电
    最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    “风雨送春归，飞雪迎春到。”伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，正面临着一个新的春天，战斗的春天，将要取得更加辉煌胜利的春天。
      今天，守卫在您身边的河北省四千三百万英雄儿女，怀着无比的喜悦，无限的深情，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳报喜：河北省革命委员会，在您的深切关怀下，在您的最新指示的指引下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的号角声中，胜利诞生了！
    燕赵原野春雷动，华北河山一片红。河北省革命委员会的成立，使整个华北地区红成一片。这是无产阶级文化大革命在伟大社会主义祖国心脏地带所取得的重大胜利。这个胜利必然使全国的大好形势好上加好，使无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，更加不可阻挡地奔腾向前！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！看长城内外，红旗如林；海河上下，人潮似海。在这凯歌高奏，万众欢腾的大喜之日，我们河北英雄儿女，怎能不心潮澎湃万感集，热血沸腾喜泪流。我们有多少知心的话儿要对您讲，我们有多少热情的歌儿要对您唱。滔滔渤海水，容不下您对我们的深厚恩情；巍巍太行山，载不起我们对您的无限热爱。万语千言，千歌万曲，汇成时代的最强音：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！敬祝您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在这喜庆的日子里，我们久经战斗风霜的河北人民，怎能忘记您率领着我们渡过的战斗岁月，怎能忘记我们跟着您跨过的万里征程！
      敬爱的毛主席，是您在中华民族生死存亡的严重关头，率领红军北上，点燃了抗日的烽火。是您用人民战争的光辉思想武装了我们，母亲送儿打东洋，妻子送郎上战场，人人奋勇争先。在太行山上，白洋淀中，青纱帐里，地道内外，无数的英雄儿女，布成了游击战争的天罗地网，创造了旷古未有的壮丽史诗，最后配合各解放区军民，把日本帝国主义这头野牛烧焦焚毁，取得了抗日战争的伟大胜利！
      敬爱的毛主席，是您以古今中外无与伦比的胆略与天才，指挥了伟大的解放战争。继清风店大捷之后，您指挥我们迅速攻克石家庄。继辽沈、淮海战役之后，您又亲自指挥了伟大的平津战役，使战略决战任务胜利完成。从此，“钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江”，埋葬了蒋家王朝，赢得了全国解放！
      敬爱的毛主席，是您在全国胜利的前夜，在西柏坡召开了具有伟大历史意义的党的七届二中全会。您高瞻远瞩，向全党全国指明了新民主主义革命过渡到社会主义革命的任务和途径，及时地提出要防止资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的袭击。您的不断革命的伟大思想，把全国人民从胜利引向新的胜利。
    敬爱的毛主席，是您掀起了震惊世界的中国农村社会主义高潮。滹沱河畔，三户贫农坚持办社的革命行动，您指出是“五亿农民的方向”；燕山南麓，只有三条驴腿的“穷棒子社”的革命精神，您称誉为“我们整个国家的形象”。全国“六万万穷棒子”沿着您指引的方向，踏上了社会主义的康庄大道。“天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇”，伟大祖国天变地变人更变，山河处处换新颜！
      敬爱的毛主席，是您在那全国大跃进的年代里，在渤海之滨，亲自主持制定了《中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议》。您迈着巨人的步伐，视察河北，走遍全国，“阅尽人间春色”。锦绣河山气象万千，三面红旗永远飘扬。
    敬爱的毛主席，是您在那国内外阶级敌人遥相呼应，群魔乱舞，掀起一股反革命逆流的严重时刻，又发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的战斗号召，宣布了无产阶级向资产阶级全面大反击的进军令，迎头痛击了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。
    敬爱的毛主席，您和河北人民心连心啊！在我们同百年罕见的洪水英勇搏斗的日日夜夜，您发出“一定要根治海河”的伟大号召，亲手绘出改天换地的宏伟蓝图。如今，稻菽涌起千层浪，海河两岸尽朝晖！当我们遭到了千年不遇的地震灾害的时候，您又派来了亲人解放军组成的毛泽东思想万人宣传队，帮助和鼓舞我们战天斗地，奋发图强。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！天大地大不如您的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如您老人家亲！忆过去，不是您的英明领导，我们广大的劳苦群众，怎能挣脱苦难的深渊？！不是您的思想哺育，我们怎能在战斗里锻炼得如此坚强？！不是您指引的方向正确，我们怎能绕过一个个暗礁，度过一道道难关，从胜利走向新的胜利？！毛主席啊，毛主席！我们的每一步前进，每一项成就，每一个胜利，都是您的光辉思想的伟大胜利！我们一定要永远读您的书，听您的话，按照您的指示办事，做您的好战士，永远紧紧跟着您建设社会主义，奔向光辉灿烂的共产主义前方！
    “一从大地起风雷，便有精生白骨堆。”河北省的土地上翻滚着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死搏斗的风烟。中国赫鲁晓夫和河北省委内一小撮走资派上下勾结，狼狈为奸，妄想在河北复辟资本主义。他们刮起一些黑风妖雾，把什么“发家致富”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等等黑货都拿到这里一些地方来扩散。臭名昭著的“桃园经验”，更是在这里炮制，从这里出笼，流毒各地。他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想，野心勃勃，罪恶滔天。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您明察秋毫，识破了中国赫鲁晓夫一伙阴谋家的狼子野心，以最伟大的无产阶级革命家的气魄，亲自发动和领导了这场史无前例、震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命。我们河北英雄儿女，紧跟您的豪迈步伐，高举无产阶级文化大革命的大旗，揪出了长期盘踞在我省的一小撮走资派。但是中国赫鲁晓夫并不甘心自己的灭亡，迫不及待地抛出了资产阶级反动路线，围剿无产阶级革命派，压制革命群众，实行白色恐怖。我们坚决响应您的“炮打司令部”的战斗号召，誓死捍卫您的无产阶级革命路线，穿迷雾，绕暗礁，打退了他们一次又一次的反扑，使他们的阴谋永远不能得逞。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！正当我们在解放军的帮助下，乘“一月革命”的东风，高举革命大批判和革命大联合的战斗旗帜的时刻，河北一小撮顽固不化的走资派，又爬了出来，造谣诽谤，挑拨离间，颠倒是非，制造混乱，转移斗争的大方向，破坏您的伟大战略部署，竟然把矛头指向了您亲手缔造的人民解放军和以您为首的无产阶级司令部。革命洪流岂容阻挡，历史车轮怎能倒转？！在这决定胜负的关头，您视察了华北、中南和华东，作了一系列极端重要的指示。您的最新指示，给了我们无穷的力量，无尽的智慧，无限的勇气。我们心更红，眼更亮，志更坚，胆更壮。在同阶级敌人反复较量的激烈搏斗中，我们越战越强，捍卫了您的革命路线，击退了来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰。我们同伟大的中国人民解放军，亲密团结，并肩战斗，结成了更加雄伟的长城。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！今天，河北形势一派大好！越来越好！从太行山麓到渤海之滨，从燕山脚下到漳河尽头，“斗私，批修”的伟大旗帜迎风招展，革命大联合和革命“三结合”的浪潮风起云涌，学习您的光辉思想的学习班如雨后春笋。工业战线频传捷报，农业生产获得特大丰收。河北四千三百万英雄儿女，从来没有象今天这样意气风发，斗志昂扬；无产阶级专政，从来没有象今天这样牢固坚强。
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们的河北省革命委员会诞生了，但是，“以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”我们的工作千头万绪，任务千条万条，但是，用您的伟大思想武装广大革命群众，实现人的思想革命化，这是根本的根本，关键的关键。我们要更深入、更广泛地掀起活学活用您的光辉思想的群众运动，继续大办毛泽东思想学习班，大兴革命的好学风。以您的最新指示为指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老五篇”为座右铭，在灵魂深处闹革命，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。让“私”字扫地出门，建立起“公”字长城。我们一定要下定最大决心：把河北省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们一定要更高地举起革命大批判的旗帜，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我省的代理人从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭。我们要巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。要改革教育，改革文艺，改革机关工作和行政管理工作。我们要整顿党的组织，加强以毛泽东思想为武装的党的建设，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的流毒。我们要让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗去占领一切阵地！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”，是您发出的伟大号召，我们坚决执行，字字照办。我们河北省地处祖国的心脏，在世界革命中心北京的周围，是保卫以您为首的无产阶级司令部的战略要地。我们一定要兢兢业业地力争把工农业生产和各项工作做得好上加好，为祖国的社会主义建设，为支援世界革命作出更大的贡献！我们一定要使河北千里原野，成为保卫您、保卫首都的最坚强的红色屏障！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们要“拥军爱民”。我们一定高举拥军大旗，更加相信和依靠解放军，拥护和热爱解放军，学习和帮助解放军，百倍警惕阶级敌人挑拨军民关系、破坏军民团结的阴谋。“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们一定要遵照您的教导，“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，大力加强无产阶级专政，巩固革命的新秩序，保卫新诞生的革命委员会。对一小撮猖狂破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏社会主义建设、扰乱社会治安的阶级敌人，不论在幕前或幕后，我们都要充分发动群众，彻底查清，坚决打击！
    革命的长河，汹涌澎湃；历史的车轮，滚滚向前。毛主席啊，毛主席！世界已进入了以您的光辉思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。您是真理的代表，黎明的曙光，人类的救星，世界的希望。在您的思想鼓舞下，世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族的革命前程似锦，人类前途灿烂辉煌！我们写不尽我们对您的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚！在这盛大的节日里，我们河北四千三百万英雄儿女向您庄严宣誓：我们头可断，血可流，您的伟大思想永不丢；海可枯，石可烂，忠于您的红心永不变！您的路，我们走定了，我们要和全国人民群众以及全世界革命人民永远走您的路，让伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉普照全球！
    最最衷心地祝愿您啊，我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                        河北省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
                                       一九六八年二月三日
