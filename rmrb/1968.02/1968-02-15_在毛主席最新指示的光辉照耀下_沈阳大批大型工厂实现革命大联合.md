Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the northeastern heavy industrial city of Shenyang, in China, has seen fifty-nine large-scale factories, each with over a thousand workers and some with as many as ten thousand, achieve revolutionary great unity. With these large-scale factories leading the way, by February 11, over 1,300 grassroots units in Shenyang had achieved revolutionary great unity.

These large-scale factories include the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant, Shenyang 53 Plant, Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, Songling Machinery Plant, Shenyang Railway Signal Plant, and Shenyang Textile Machinery Plant, among others. The revolutionary mass organizations in these factories are mostly the core forces of the three revolutionary mass organizations in Shenyang, and there has been significant opposition among them in the past.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two diametrically opposed factions." The various factions of revolutionary mass organizations in these factories, guided by Chairman Mao's latest instructions and with the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, have held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have fiercely combated selfishness, promoted selflessness, smashed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthened proletarian party spirit. Their ideological awareness has greatly improved. Revolutionary workers across the board say, "Before liberation, we were all class brothers suffering from the oppression of Japanese invaders and the reactionary Kuomintang. After liberation, we are comrades working together for socialist revolution and socialist construction. We not only work in the same factory, but some of us are in the same workshop, group, or even on the same machine. The reason we split into factions is entirely the result of the persistent implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents." With the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams stationed in the factories, these factories' various factions of revolutionary mass organizations have vigorously combated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, quickly creating a situation where leaders lead the masses, and the masses urge the leaders to achieve revolutionary great unity through consultation.

The revolutionary workers of these large factories, in the process of consulting to achieve revolutionary great unity, follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, "make more self-criticisms, seek common ground while reserving differences," and consciously overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, prioritizing revolutionary interests, and showing mutual understanding and accommodation. On some specific issues, when individual leaders or masses temporarily do not understand, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams address their active thoughts, delivering Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the scene and to their homes. Therefore, the various factions of revolutionary mass organizations in these factories have quickly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieved revolutionary great unity in the factories before and after the Spring Festival.

    在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下
    沈阳大批大型工厂实现革命大联合
    新华社沈阳十四日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，我国东北重工业城市沈阳，已有五十九个拥有千人以上，多至万人的大型工厂，实现了革命大联合。在这批大型工厂的带动下，到二月十一日，沈阳全市已有一千三百多个基层单位实现了革命大联合。
    这批大型工厂，包括沈阳重型机器厂、东北机器制造厂、沈阳五三工厂、沈阳机车车辆厂、沈阳风动工具厂、松陵机械厂、沈阳铁路信号厂和沈阳纺织机械厂等。这些工厂的革命群众组织，多数是沈阳三大革命群众组织的骨干力量，过去对立情绪比较严重。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”这些工厂的几派革命群众组织，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的大力帮助下，通过大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，思想觉悟有了很大提高。广大革命职工说，解放前，我们都是一块遭受日本侵略者和国民党反动派剥削、压迫的阶级兄弟；解放后，我们是携手进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的同志。我们不仅在一个工厂，有的还是在一个车间一个小组，甚至就在一台机器上共同劳动。我们所以分成几派，完全是中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人顽固推行资产阶级反动路线造成的恶果。这批工厂的几派革命群众组织，在驻厂的人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大力围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，很快出现了头头带群众，群众促头头，协商实现革命大联合的大好局面。
    这些大工厂的几派革命工人，在协商实现革命大联合的过程中，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，“各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”，自觉地克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，以革命利益为重，互谅互让。在一些具体问题上，有时个别头头或群众一时想不通，毛泽东思想宣传队就针对他们的活思想，把毛主席的最新指示送到现场去，送到他们家中去。因此，这批工厂的几派革命群众组织，迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，在春节前后接连实现了全厂的革命大联合。
