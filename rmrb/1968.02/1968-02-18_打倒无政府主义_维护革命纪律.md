Currently, the situation across the country is excellent, but in some places, there are still some bad phenomena. Some units have people who are absent from work without reason, leave their production and work posts at will, arrive late and leave early, and do a perfunctory job. This phenomenon of lax labor and work discipline has already affected the completion of production and work tasks in these units. This is a reflection of the anarchist trend in our ranks.

If we allow the anarchist situation to continue, it will greatly disperse our revolutionary organization, relax our revolutionary discipline, weaken our troops' combat effectiveness, damage the authority of the proletarian revolution, and weaken the proletarian dictatorship. Anarchism is a reaction against the newly established revolutionary committees. Anarchism, like the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, is a great enemy of the proletarian revolutionary forces. If anarchism is not overthrown, the arbitrary behavior of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will spread everywhere, the new revolutionary order will not be able to be established and consolidated, the phenomenon of lax labor discipline will not be able to be stopped, and both revolution and production will suffer greatly. While eliminating the "private" mentality and suppressing factionalism, we must also pay attention to studying various anarchist tendencies that appear in production and work, and then surround and suppress them, and defeat them in battle.

    打倒无政府主义　维护革命纪律
    目前，全国一片大好形势，但是，在一些地方也存在一些不良现象。有些单位还有一些人无故旷工缺勤，擅离生产和工作岗位，迟到早退，敷衍了事。这种劳动和工作纪律松弛的现象，已经影响到这些单位生产和工作任务的完成。这是我们队伍中无政府主义思潮的一种反映。
    如果允许无政府主义状况存在下去，则将极大地涣散我们的革命组织，松懈我们的革命纪律，削弱我们队伍的战斗力，损害无产阶级革命权威，削弱无产阶级专政。无政府主义是对新成立的革命委员会的一种反动。无政府主义和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性一样，是无产阶级革命派的大敌。无政府主义不打倒，资产阶级、小资产阶级随意性就会到处泛滥，革命的新秩序就无法建立和巩固，劳动纪律松弛的现象就无法制止，革命和生产都将受到极大的损害。在铲除“私”字，围剿派性的同时，不可不注意研究生产上、工作中表现出来的种种无政府主义倾向，从而围而剿之，战而胜之。
