Our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the call to "save and make revolution," and revolutionary masses across the country and in all sectors have responded resolutely, earnestly implementing it. Many workers and residents in coal-consuming units have also actively followed Chairman Mao's teachings, exploring every possible way to improve coal-burning techniques and stove designs, thus saving the country a large amount of coal. They say: coal is the grain of industry. Every piece of coal we save helps the country's industrialization and supports the world revolution.

However, we have also noticed that some comrades hold incorrect views on the issue of saving coal. Some comrades think that with the current heavy production tasks, there is no time to focus on coal-saving work; they even say that as long as production is good, wasting a bit of coal is nothing to worry about. Others believe that their unit uses little coal, and it does not account for much of the product cost, so there is not much waste. Because of these ideas, they do not pay attention to saving coal in production and life. Especially in production units, they only focus on production and not on saving coal. As a result, the coal consumption for producing the same product varies greatly among different units. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must oppose waste and practice economy"; "reduce the cost of industrial production and increase labor productivity." In the matter of coal consumption, we must also do our utmost to practice economy. It is wrong to oppose production and economy. Strictly speaking, even if the production plan for quantity and quality of products is completed, if raw materials and fuels are wasted, it cannot be said that the production task has been well completed.

Economy is not just about saving money and materials; more importantly, we must always maintain the fine tradition of the proletariat's hard work, plain living, and thrift in building the country, and guard against the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. This is a major issue concerning whether we can hold power well, use power well, and whether the socialist country will change color. It must not be taken lightly.

### 既要抓生产  又要抓节约

    既要抓生产  又要抓节约
    我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“要节约闹革命”的号召后，全国各地各条战线上的革命群众都坚决响应，认真贯彻执行。许多用煤单位的职工和居民，也积极遵循毛主席的教导，千方百计改进烧煤技术，改进炉灶，为国家节省了大量的煤炭。他们说：煤炭是工业的粮食，我们多节约一块煤，就为国家工业化、为支援世界革命多增添一份力量。
    但是，我们也看到有些同志对节约用煤问题还存在一些不正确的想法。有的同志认为，当前生产任务重，顾不上节煤工作；甚至说，只要生产搞好了，浪费点煤算不了什么。有的认为自己单位用煤不多，占产品成本不多，浪费不了多少。由于有了以上这些想法，他们在生产和生活中就不去注意节约煤炭。尤其是生产单位，只抓生产，不抓节约。结果生产同样的产品，不同单位的耗煤量就大不相同。毛主席教导我们：“必须反对浪费，厉行节约”；“节省工业生产的成本，提高劳动生产率”。在用煤这个环节上，也必须尽一切可能厉行节约。把生产和节约对立起来是错误的。严格说来，浪费了原材料和燃料，即使产品的产量质量计划完成得再好，也不能算是很好地完成生产任务。
    节约，决不仅仅是在经济上省点钱省点物，而更重要的是我们要在思想上永远保持无产阶级艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的优良传统，防止资产阶级思想的侵袭。这是关系到我们掌好权，用好权，关系到社会主义国家变不变颜色的大问题，切不可等闲视之。
