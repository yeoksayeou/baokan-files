The Chinese-Vietnamese Friendship Association today sent a telegram to the Vietnamese-Chinese Friendship Association, expressing the most enthusiastic welcome to the great victory of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and the most enthusiastic congratulations to the people of South Vietnam on their New Year's great victory.

The telegram said, the New Year's great victory of the South Vietnamese military and people fully demonstrates the immense power of people's war, pushing the people's war in Vietnam to a new height. As the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong said, "By mobilizing the entire population, one can create an ocean that will drown the enemy." In the struggle against American aggression for national salvation, the Vietnamese people have shown great revolutionary spirit and high organizational discipline and unity. The Chinese people express boundless admiration and we must learn from you seriously.

The telegram said, we firmly believe that the 31 million heroic Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese Labor Party, will surely continue to strive, overcome all difficulties, and advance courageously, completely defeating the American aggressors and their lackeys, liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the country, until final victory.

The telegram expressed that all Chinese people resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying out the struggle against American aggression for national salvation to the end.

The Chinese-Vietnamese Friendship Association today also sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, expressing the most enthusiastic congratulations to the military and people of South Vietnam on their brilliant victory in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

The telegram said, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said, "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The New Year's great victory of the South Vietnamese military and people has demonstrated the immense power of people's war, combining military and civilian efforts, urban and rural areas, and internal and external forces, creating a new situation, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people of the world, and greatly undermining the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. It proclaims to the world that the complete failure of American imperialism in Vietnam is not far off.

The telegram said, we firmly believe that the heroic Vietnamese people will surely continue to strive, overcome all difficulties, and advance courageously, until they achieve final victory.

The telegram finally expressed that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to be the strong backing of the brotherly Vietnamese people, resolutely supporting the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying out the struggle against American aggression for national salvation to the end.

The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity sent a telegram to the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of South Vietnam on February 10, saying that the Chinese people are extremely delighted and inspired by the New Year's great victory of the South Vietnamese military and people. The telegram said, we enthusiastically welcome and congratulate the unprecedented brilliant victory of the brotherly South Vietnamese military and people.

The telegram said, the American imperialists, beset by internal and external difficulties, have already fallen into a passive, helpless, and desperate situation in Vietnam. However, they will surely make a desperate struggle. Our great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, said, "Persistence is victory." We firmly believe that the heroic Vietnamese people, who have already taken the initiative in the war, will surely, under the inspiration of the spirit of decisive battle and decisive victory, continue to strive, overcome all difficulties, and achieve the final victory in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

The telegram finally said, the Chinese people, following the teachings of our great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the struggle against American aggression for national salvation to the end.
