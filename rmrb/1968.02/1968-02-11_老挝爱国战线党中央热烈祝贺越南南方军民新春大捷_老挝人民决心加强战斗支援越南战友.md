	The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front warmly congratulates the great spring victory of the Vietnamese people in the South. The Lao people are determined to strengthen their combat support for their Vietnamese comrades.

	KANHOK, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on February 7, warmly hailing the great spring victory of the Vietnamese people in the South. The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people are determined to join the Vietnamese people in foiling all the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

	The statement said: The great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the South since the spring festival are a thunderous blow to the common enemy of the world's people, U.S. imperialism, pushing it into a passive and desperate situation. These great victories are a great encouragement to the world's people, especially to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are waging national liberation struggles, and have set a brilliant example for them.

	The statement pointed out: Under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the Vietnamese people in the South have created many unique and effective combat methods. They have closely combined military offensives with the widespread armed struggle of the masses in the mountains, plains, and cities, pushing the people's war to a new level. These practical experiences are extremely valuable contributions to the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and especially to the struggle of the Lao people.

	The statement said: The Lao Patriotic Front and all the Lao people warmly congratulate and hail the great victories of their Vietnamese comrades in the South, and regard these victories as their own. The statement expressed the determination of the Lao people to support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people and firmly believe that, under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which is invincible in a hundred battles, the Vietnamese people in the South will certainly foil the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism.

	The statement finally said: No matter how vicious, savage, and brutal the plots and actions of U.S. imperialism, the Lao Patriotic Front and all the Lao people, as close comrades of the Vietnamese people, will join the Vietnamese people in the anti-U.S. struggle to resolutely foil all the aggressive plots and actions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in Laos. They will resolutely foil all the plots of U.S. imperialism in collusion with the reactionary cliques of Laos, Thailand, and South Vietnam to turn Laos into a springboard for expanding the war in Indochina and Southeast Asia. This is a practical support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.
