The official newspaper of the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, "New Humanity," published an editorial by the Party Central Committee Secretariat member François Martel on February 8, enthusiastically hailing the recent brilliant victories of the military and people of South Vietnam.

The editorial said, "In the face of large-scale attacks by the military and people of South Vietnam, the true face of American imperialism has been exposed. Like all imperialists and reactionaries in the world, it appears strong but is in fact a 'paper tiger.'"

Martel expressed great admiration for the extraordinary courage and heroism of the Vietnamese people. He said, "The French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party has always been confident in the ultimate victory of the Vietnamese people and extends warm congratulations to the South Vietnamese military and people for their brilliant victories, pledging full support and solidarity."

The editorial pointed out that the U.S. aggressors "will inevitably be defeated and driven out of Vietnam by the Vietnamese people."

The editorial said, "The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, combining the specific conditions of Vietnam and the specific conditions of U.S. aggression, has applied the strategy and tactics of protracted people's war taught by Mao Zedong, which has once again proven to be completely effective and undeniably superior."

The editorial pointed out that American imperialism will continue to struggle desperately, attempting to avoid defeat.

The editorial condemned the "peace talks" conspiracy played by U.S. President Johnson in collusion with the Soviet revisionist leaders. The editorial said, "For Johnson, negotiations mean attempting to obtain at the negotiating table what he could not achieve with the most advanced and most terrible weapons, to keep the U.S. expeditionary forces in South Vietnam." To this end, Johnson "has gathered a group of accomplices in the United Nations, the Vatican, London, New Delhi, and especially in Moscow, which has recently become the center for those who act as agents for U.S. conspiracies."

Martel expressed his belief that, with the support of the Chinese people and the progressive people of the world, the Vietnamese people will certainly foil the war blackmail and "peace talks" deception of American imperialism and achieve a complete victory.

The official newspaper of the left-wing faction of the Japanese Communist Party's Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee, "People's Star," published an article on February 5, pointing out that the New Year's victories of the military and people of South Vietnam have given immense inspiration to all Asian peoples and people around the world who are suffering from U.S. imperialist aggression, control, interference, and bullying, and have provided great support to the anti-U.S. struggle of the people of the world.

The article said that the great victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam clearly prove that American imperialism, which appears to be very strong, is in fact not so formidable. The Vietnamese people have proven to the world with irrefutable facts that the power of people's war is boundless, and that only the people are the strongest force. Aggressive wars are bound to fail, and just wars of the people are bound to win. This is an irresistible law of history that no one can stop.

The article said, "The great leader of the world's people, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on December 19 last year, said: 'The days of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam are numbered. But all reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will certainly struggle desperately. They will certainly adopt various military adventures and political deceptions to save themselves from destruction. And the revolutionary people, before they achieve final victory, will certainly encounter various difficulties, but these difficulties are all surmountable, and no difficulties can stop the advance of the revolutionary people. Persistence is victory. I am deeply convinced that the Vietnamese people, by persisting in a protracted war, will certainly drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam.' The article said, Comrade Mao Zedong's telegram correctly pointed out the prospect of the inevitable victory of the Vietnamese people's war of liberation. Comrade Mao Zedong's invincible theory of people's war has become the most important theoretical weapon in the great anti-U.S. struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people will certainly advance to final victory."

The article said, "The revolutionary people of Japan warmly hail the great victories of the Vietnamese people, resolutely support the just war of the Vietnamese people, and are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people and the people of the world to push the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle to a new high.

    法国马列主义共产党书记和日本《人民之星》欢呼南越军民辉煌胜利
    越南人民必将把美国侵略者赶出国土
    新华社巴黎电　法国马克思列宁主义共产党机关报《新人道报》，八日刊登党中央委员会书记处书记弗朗索瓦·马尔蒂写的一篇社论，热烈欢呼越南南方军民最近取得的辉煌胜利。
    社论说，在南越军民的大规模袭击面前，“美帝国主义的原形毕露了。它同世界上一切帝国主义者和各国反动派一样，貌似强大，但是实际上却是名副其实的‘纸老虎’。”
    马尔蒂在社论中表示万分钦佩越南人民的非凡的胆略和英雄气概。他说，法国马克思列宁主义共产党始终对越南人民的最后胜利充满信心，并且对获得辉煌胜利的越南南方军民表示热烈祝贺，保证给他们以全力支持和声援。
    社论指出，美国侵略者“必不可免地将被越南人民打败和被赶出越南去。”
    社论说：“越南南方民族解放阵线结合越南的具体情况和美国侵略的具体情况，运用了毛泽东所教导的持久的人民战争的战略战术，这已经再一次证明完全有效，而且具有无可置疑的优越性。”
    社论指出，美帝国主义仍将进行垂死挣扎，企图逃脱失败。
    社论谴责美帝头子约翰逊勾结苏修头目所玩弄的“和谈”阴谋。社论说：“对约翰逊来说，进行谈判意味着企图在谈判桌上得到他凭借最精良、最可怕的武器所未能得到的东西，使美国远征军赖在南越。”为此，约翰逊“在联合国、梵蒂冈、伦敦、新德里，特别是在莫斯科，纠集了一些帮凶，莫斯科近来已经成为替美国阴谋充当说客的人集结的中心”。
    马尔蒂在社论中表示相信，越南人民在中国人民和全世界进步人民的支持下，一定能够挫败美帝国主义的战争讹诈和“和谈”骗局，取得彻底胜利。
    新华社东京十二日电　日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）机关报《人民之星》，五日发表文章指出，越南南方军民的新春大捷，给予了一切受美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的亚洲人民和全世界人民无限的鼓舞，给予了全世界人民的反美斗争巨大的支持。
    文章说，越南南方军民所取得的伟大胜利清楚地证明美帝国主义是看起来好象很强大，而实际上并没有什么了不起的力量的纸老虎。越南人民以无可辩驳的事实向全世界人民证明人民战争的威力是无穷的，唯有人民才是最强大的力量。侵略战争必然失败，正义的人民战争必然胜利。这是任何人也阻止不了的历史规律。
    文章说，全世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志在去年十二月十九日给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席的电报中说：“美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。但是，一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。而革命人民在取得最后胜利之前，也必然会遇到各式各样的困难，但是，这些困难都是可以克服的，任何困难都阻挡不住革命人民的前进。坚持下去就是胜利。我深信，越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。”文章说，毛泽东同志的电报正确地指出了越南人民解放战争必然胜利的前景。毛泽东同志的战无不胜的人民战争理论已经成了越南人民伟大抗美斗争的最重要的理论武器。越南人民一定会乘胜前进，取得最后胜利。
    文章说，日本革命人民热烈欢呼越南人民的伟大胜利，坚决支持越南人民的正义战争，下定决心和越南人民、全世界人民肩并肩地进行斗争，进一步把反美爱国斗争推进到一个新的高潮。
