HANOI, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) - The armed forces and the people of South Vietnam launched a comprehensive offensive during the Spring Festival, demonstrating the immense power of a people's war. They launched a powerful assault on a series of important cities, military bases, and strongholds occupied by the enemy, inflicting heavy casualties and causing panic among the enemy, achieving extremely brilliant results.

According to preliminary statistics from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the past three days, the heroic people and armed forces of South Vietnam have attacked 33 provincial capitals and cities occupied by the enemy, as well as 31 towns and counties in 32 provinces; they have attacked or occupied 35 important military and political institutions and bases of the American and puppet groups, including the U.S. "Embassy," the puppet "Presidential Palace," the puppet Army General Staff Office, the puppet Navy Headquarters, and the Paratrooper Headquarters; they have attacked 24 air bases and airports of the American and puppet forces; they have attacked and occupied five radio stations in five major cities occupied by the enemy. In addition, they have completely paralyzed important enemy transportation lines such as the No. 1, No. 4, and No. 14 highways.

The people's liberation armed forces, fighting bravely with the support of the people, have annihilated a large number of American and puppet troops. In Hue alone, they have annihilated and severely damaged two armored regiments and five battalions of American and puppet troops. At the U.S. air base in Da Nang and the Yonglong Airport, they have destroyed 130 enemy aircraft. The Associated Press exclaimed that the U.S. aggressor forces have suffered the heaviest casualties in such a short period of time in the Vietnam War.

During the attacks on various enemy-occupied towns and military bases by the people's liberation armed forces, the local people rose up in rebellion, either fighting alongside the people's liberation armed forces to attack enemy strongholds and cut off enemy supply lines, or destroying American and puppet ruling institutions in the cities and severely punishing evil puppet military and political officials. In addition, batches of puppet military and political personnel have risen up or surrendered to the people, turning their guns around to redeem their sins.

The people's liberation armed forces are advancing in victory, continuing to launch powerful offensives against the enemy. According to reports, as of February 2, the people's liberation armed forces and local patriotic people were still bravely fighting in the heart of the enemy, Saigon City, and its suburbs, annihilating a large number of American aggressor forces and puppet troops, and still controlling part of the city's streets. The people's liberation armed forces have also launched fierce attacks on the largest fighter jet base and airport of the American aggressor forces near Saigon, the Bien Hoa base, striking the American bandits and turning the base into a sea of fire.

The people's liberation armed forces have completely controlled the important city of Da Lat in the central region. The enemy in Phan Rang, the capital of Ninh Thuan Province, and Phan Thiet, the capital of Binh Thuan Province, have also been subjected to fierce attacks by the people's liberation armed forces. Thus, almost all the enemy-occupied towns and military bases in the central and southern regions of South Vietnam have been attacked or occupied by the people's liberation armed forces.

The people's liberation armed forces have also completely controlled the important city of Hue in the northern region of South Vietnam. The people of Hue have bravely fought side by side with the people's liberation armed forces, pursuing and capturing hidden enemies. On January 31, the American bandits and their lackeys dispatched three battalions of puppet troops, protected by armored vehicles, to counterattack, attempting to retake Hue City. The military and people of Hue bravely rushed forward, fiercely attacking the enemy, annihilating about 100 enemy troops, destroying four enemy armored vehicles, and shooting down multiple helicopters. The remaining enemy troops were terrified and fled in all directions, with some puppet soldiers surrendering to the people. According to preliminary statistics, from the night of January 30 to the morning of January 31, the military and people of Hue have annihilated a puppet armored regiment, severely damaged an American armored regiment, annihilated and severely damaged five puppet battalions and a large number of puppet security and police personnel, destroyed 39 tanks and armored vehicles, and shot down six enemy aircraft.

Victory reports continue to come from the southern plains of South Vietnam. The military and people of the southern plains, including the provinces of Long An, Kien Giang, My Tho, Soc Trang, and Ba Xuyen, have closely coordinated with other battlefields in the south, attacking a series of enemy bases, airports, warehouses, military command centers, and puppet government institutions, achieving extremely great victories.

In Long An Province, the military and people launched a surprise attack on all puppet military bases and government institutions within the provincial capital of Long An City in the early hours of January 31, occupying the residence of the puppet "provincial governor," the puppet military compound, and the communication station. The Long An Airport and the base of the puppet main force 16th Regiment were also subjected to fierce attacks by the people's liberation armed forces.

In Kien Giang Province, the people's liberation armed forces launched multiple attacks on the provincial capital of Kien Giang City on January 31, attacking the puppet government administrative office, public security and police headquarters, surrounding and attacking the enemy military compound, puppet military training school, and the command center of the puppet 21st Division's 32nd Regiment, and shelling the Kien Giang City Airport, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

In My Tho Province, with the cooperation of patriotic soldiers within the puppet forces and the local people, the people's liberation armed forces launched an attack on the headquarters of the puppet 7th Division, the puppet military compound command center, the residence of American "advisors," and other military and administrative facilities of the enemy in the morning of January 31, cutting off the No. 4 highway; they annihilated the puppet provincial security command and the puppet 31st Special Forces Battalion. They also opened the prison, liberating more than 2,000 patriotic compatriots who had been imprisoned by the enemy. Patriotic soldiers within the puppet forces also cooperated with the people's liberation armed forces to destroy two cannons and burn down a fuel depot.

    排山倒海的威力　惊天动地的攻势
    南越军民猛冲猛打歼灭大量美伪军
    各地人民纷纷揭竿而起　许多伪军政人员掉转枪口立功赎罪
    据新华社河内二日电  越南南方人民解放武装力量和广大南方人民一起，春节期间全面出击，发挥人民战争的无比威力，向一系列敌占重要城镇、军事基地和据点发动惊天动地的强大攻势，打得敌人死伤惨重，丧魂落魄，取得了极其辉煌的战果。
    据越南南方解放通讯社初步统计，在最近三天中，英雄的越南南方军民对三十三个敌占省会和城市以及三十二个省中的三十一个镇和县发动了进攻；袭击或占领了三十五个美伪集团的重要军政机构和基地，其中包括美国“大使馆”、伪“总统府”、伪军总参谋部办公厅、伪海军总部和伞兵总部；袭击了美伪军的二十四个空军基地和飞机场；袭击并占领了五个敌占大城市的广播电台；此外，还使第一、第四和第十四号公路等敌军重要交通线完全陷于瘫痪。
    人民解放武装力量英勇战斗，在人民配合下消灭了美伪军大批有生力量，单在顺化市就消灭和重创两个美伪军的装甲团和伪军五个营，单在岘港美国空军基地和永隆机场就摧毁敌机一百三十架。美联社惊呼，美国侵略军在这样短的时间中遇到的伤亡是在侵越战争中“伤亡最重的一次”。
    在人民解放武装力量袭击各敌占城镇和军事基地时，当地人民纷纷揭竿而起，或者和人民解放武装力量一起冲锋陷阵，袭击敌军据点和切断敌军的交通线；或者在城镇中奋起捣毁美伪统治机构，严惩作恶多端的伪军政官吏。此外，各地伪军政人员也成批起义或向人民投诚，掉转枪口立功赎罪。
    人民解放武装力量正在乘胜前进，继续向敌人发动强大攻势。据报道，直到二日为止，人民解放武装力量和当地爱国人民仍在敌人的心脏西贡市中心和郊区英勇战斗，消灭了大量美国侵略军和伪军，并且仍控制着城市中的一部分街区。人民解放武装力量还向位于西贡附近的美国侵略军在南越最大的战斗机基地边和机场发动猛烈进攻，痛击美国强盗，基地成了一片火海。
    人民解放武装力量已完全控制了中部地区的大城市大叻市。宁顺省省会藩朗和平顺省省会藩切的敌人也遭到了人民解放武装力量的猛烈袭击。这样，越南南方中部中区和南区敌占城镇和敌军基地几乎全部受到人民解放武装力量的袭击或占领。
    人民解放武装力量并已完全控制了越南南方北部的重要城市顺化市。顺化市人民英勇地同人民解放武装力量并肩战斗，追捕隐藏的敌人。一月三十一日，美国强盗及其走狗出动三营伪军，在装甲车的掩护下进行反扑，妄图夺回顺化市。顺化市军民英勇地冲上前去，猛烈地打击敌人，歼敌一百名左右，并击毁敌人装甲车四辆，击落直升飞机多架。残敌惊恐万状，四散逃窜，一部分伪军士兵向人民投诚。据初步统计，顺化市军民从一月三十日夜间到三十一日晨，共歼灭伪军一个装甲团，重创美军一个装甲团，歼灭和重创伪军五个营和大批伪保安和警察人员，击毁坦克、装甲车三十九辆，击落敌机六架。
    捷报还不断从越南南方南部平原传来。南部平原的永隆、金瓯、美尔萩、朔庄和薄寮等省军民，同南方其它各个战场紧密配合，袭击了敌人的一系列基地、机场、仓库、军事指挥所和伪政权机构，取得了极其巨大的胜利。
    永隆省军民在一月三十一日凌晨袭击了省会永隆市内的所有伪军基地和伪政权机构，占领了伪“省长”住所、伪军事小区和通讯站。永隆机场和伪主力军第十六团的基地也遭到了人民解放武装力量的猛烈袭击。
    在金瓯省，人民解放武装力量一月三十一日分成多路冲进省会金瓯市内，袭击伪政权行政办公厅、公安和警察厅，包围和袭击敌人军事小区、伪军事训练学校、伪军第二十一师第三十二团指挥所，还炮击金瓯市机场，使敌人受到严重损失。
    在美萩省，人民解放武装力量在当地人民和伪军中的爱国士兵的配合下，一月三十一日上午袭击了伪军第七师司令部、伪军事小区指挥所、美国“顾问”住宅区以及敌人的其他军事设施和行政机构，切断了第四号公路；歼灭了伪省保安队指挥部和伪第三十一别动营。他们还打开监狱，使被敌人监禁的二千多个爱国同胞得到了解放。伪军中的爱国士兵还配合人民解放武装力量，摧毁大炮两门，烧毁汽油库一座。
