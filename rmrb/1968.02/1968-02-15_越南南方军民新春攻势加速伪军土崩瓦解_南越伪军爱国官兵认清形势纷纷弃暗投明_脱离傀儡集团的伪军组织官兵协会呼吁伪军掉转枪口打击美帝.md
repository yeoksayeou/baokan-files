In the face of the thunderous strikes of the Vietnamese Southern military and civilians' Tet Offensive, and under the call of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to resist American aggression and save the nation, the already demoralized puppet army of South Vietnam has accelerated its collapse. More and more puppet soldiers and officers have seen through the situation, abandoned the wrong path, and turned to the right side. Large numbers of puppet soldiers refuse to continue fighting for the American aggressors and have fled, making the American invaders, who are already mired in the quagmire, even more desperate.

In the powerful offensive of the Vietnamese Southern military and civilians, military attacks and political work to disintegrate the enemy forces are closely combined. From the outset, many patriotic puppet soldiers and officers have risen up, turning their guns against the American-puppet clique, and coordinating with the people's liberation armed forces and the people to attack the enemy, forming a situation of internal and external attacks that the enemy cannot withstand. In Hue, the command post of the puppet army's First Division was completely paralyzed at the start of the battle. In Saigon, a battalion of patriotic puppet soldiers staged a rebellion, seizing the arsenal and, together with the people's liberation armed forces, annihilating many puppet police and notorious American lackeys. In Da Nang, immediately after the people's liberation armed forces launched an attack on January 30, hundreds of patriotic puppet soldiers turned their guns around, and almost all the officers and soldiers of the "Self-Defense Corps" Third Company rebelled, annihilating many American lackeys. In many areas, after the patriotic puppet soldiers and officers rebelled, they established their own patriotic organizations, determined to stand with the people, drive out the American aggressors, and overthrow the traitorous clique of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky.

In Tuy Hoa Province, a battalion of puppet soldiers surrendered with their weapons. Around Hue, from February 2 to 4, more than 700 puppet soldiers and officials of the puppet government surrendered. In the Mekong Delta, from January 31 to February 7, more than 100 outposts and sentry posts in the provinces of My Tho and Ben Tre saw puppet soldiers either fleeing or handing over their outposts, sentry posts, and weapons to the revolutionary armed forces. In Ben Tre City, thousands of puppet soldiers fled. In Chau Doc County, nearly 300 patriotic puppet soldiers joined the people in fighting for six days, leveling 36 outposts and sentry posts. Along the Fourth Highway, in more than ten outposts and sentry posts, puppet soldiers either fled or handed over their outposts, sentry posts, and weapons to the revolutionary armed forces from January 31 to February 5.

The mass desertion of puppet soldiers has caused some puppet units to completely disintegrate. The puppet marine corps' First Battalion stationed in the My Tho region of My Tho Province saw more than 500 puppet soldiers flee in just two days, from January 31 to February 1, effectively dissolving the so-called "elite" marine corps battalion.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the Soldiers' Association, composed of officers and soldiers who have left the puppet army's First Division of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, issued an appeal to the puppet troops stationed in Quang Tri Province, Thua Thien Province, and Hue City, calling on them to rebel and join the revolutionary armed forces to strike against the American aggressors.

The appeal states: The situation of the United States and its puppet clique has become hopeless. The rule of the United States and its puppet clique has shaken and is on the verge of collapse.

The appeal calls on the remaining officers and soldiers of the puppet army's First Division to quickly leave the puppet army, hand over their weapons and outposts to the revolutionary army; resist orders to go to the front line or to be sent as reinforcements, resist orders to suppress the people; rebel, turn their guns against the American aggressors and stubborn puppet military commanders, and join the people's side; fight alongside the revolutionary armed forces to strike against the American aggressors, annihilate the puppet army, and liberate the nation.

    越南南方军民新春攻势加速伪军土崩瓦解
    南越伪军爱国官兵认清形势纷纷弃暗投明
    脱离傀儡集团的伪军组织官兵协会呼吁伪军掉转枪口打击美帝
    据新华社河内十二日电　在越南南方军民新春攻势雷霆万钧般的打击下，在越南南方民族解放阵线的抗美救国号召下，本已士气低落的南越伪军更加速土崩瓦解，越来越多的伪军爱国官兵认清形势，弃暗投明，大批伪军士兵不愿继续为美国侵略者卖命，纷纷逃跑，使深陷泥沼的美国侵略者处境更加狼狈。
    越南南方军民在新春强大的攻势中，军事进攻和瓦解敌军的政治工作紧密结合，一开始就争取了许多伪军爱国官兵起义，把枪口指向美伪集团，配合人民解放武装力量和人民进攻敌人，形成内外夹击的局面，使敌人无法招架。在顺化，伪军第一师的司令部在战斗一开始就被打得动弹不得，完全处于瘫痪状态。在朔庄市，一个营的伪军爱国官兵举行起义，他们占领了军火库，并同人民解放武装力量一起，消灭了许多伪警察和作恶多端的美国走狗。在朱笃市，当一月三十日人民解放武装力量发起攻击后，立即就有几百名伪军爱国士兵掉转枪口，还有三连“民卫队”的官兵几乎全部起义，并消灭了许多美国走狗。许多地区伪军爱国官兵起义后，建立了自己的爱国组织，决心站到人民一边，赶走美国侵略者，推翻阮文绍—阮高其卖国集团。
    在土龙木省，有一营伪军携带武器向人民投诚。在顺化周围，从二月二日到四日，也有七百多名伪军官兵和伪政权人员投诚。在湄公河三角洲，从一月三十一日到二月七日，驻扎在美萩、槟椥两省的一百多个据点、哨所里的伪军士兵，有的纷纷逃跑，有的把据点、哨所和武器交给革命武装力量。在槟椥市，有成千名伪军士兵逃跑。在左沥县，六天中有近三百名伪军爱国士兵同人民一道奋起斗争，夷平据点和哨所三十六个。在第四号公路沿线的成十个据点、哨所里的伪军官兵，从一月三十一日到二月五日，纷纷逃跑或者把据点、哨所和武器交给革命武装力量。
    大批伪军士兵逃跑，使一些伪军单位完全陷于瓦解状态。驻扎在美萩省丐礼地区的伪军海军陆战队第一营，在一月三十一日和二月一日两天中，就有五百多名伪军士兵逃跑，被称为伪军“王牌”部队海军陆战队的这个营实际上已经瓦解。
    据新华社河内十二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，由脱离阮文绍—阮高其集团的伪军第一师的官兵所组成的官兵协会，向驻在广治省、承天省和顺化市的傀儡军发出呼吁书，呼吁他们起义，同革命武装部队一道打击美国侵略者。
    呼吁书说：美国及其傀儡集团的局势已经变得毫无希望了。美国及其傀儡集团的统治发生了动摇并已濒临崩溃。
    呼吁书呼吁伪军第一师剩下的官兵迅速脱离傀儡军队，把武器和据点交给革命军队；抵制被派往前线或派作援军的命令，抵制镇压人民的命令；举行起义，掉转枪口对准美国侵略者和顽固的傀儡军指挥官，并投奔到人民方面来；同革命武装部队一道打击美国侵略者，消灭傀儡军，解放祖国。
