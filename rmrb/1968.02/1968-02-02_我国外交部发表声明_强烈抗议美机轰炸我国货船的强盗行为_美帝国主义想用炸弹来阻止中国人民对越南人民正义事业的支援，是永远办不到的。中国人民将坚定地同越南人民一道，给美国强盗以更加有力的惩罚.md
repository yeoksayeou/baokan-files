The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on February 1, 2023, which reads as follows:

On January 20 and January 27, U.S. warplanes launched savage air raids on the Chinese cargo ship Hongqi 152, which was docked at Hong Kai Port in Vietnam, and the Chinese cargo ship Hongqi 153, which was docked at Cam Pha Port. Several crew members were injured, and the ships sustained severe damage. This is a deliberate provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people. The Chinese government and people strongly condemn this banditry by U.S. imperialism.

We must warn U.S. imperialism that you will never be able to stop the Chinese people from supporting the just cause of the Vietnamese people with bombs, nor will you be able to disrupt normal exchanges between China and Vietnam. The crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people will definitely be settled. The Chinese people will, as always, stand firmly with the Vietnamese people and give the U.S. bandits a more powerful punishment until we finally and completely defeat the U.S. aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 1, 2023: The U.S. imperialists, who are plotting to intensify and expand the war in Vietnam, once again brazenly sent warplanes to attack Chinese cargo ships loading coal at Hong Kai Port and Cam Pha Port in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 20 and January 27. This is another extremely serious military provocation against China by U.S. imperialism following their savage attack on a Chinese cargo ship docked at Cam Pha Port in Vietnam on January 3.

At 4:25 AM on January 20, our cargo ship Hongqi 152 was loading coal at Hong Kai Port when it was suddenly subjected to a barbaric air raid by U.S. warplanes, injuring six crew members.

At 0:55 AM on January 27, our cargo ship Hongqi 153 was loading coal at Cam Pha Port when it was again subjected to a savage attack by U.S. warplanes. Twelve bombs exploded around our cargo ship, damaging more than 20 parts of the ship.

In just one month, U.S. imperialism has brazenly bombed our cargo ships three times, fully exposing its desperate situation after suffering repeated defeats in the Vietnam War and revealing its determination to make China its enemy to the end.

    我国外交部发表声明
    强烈抗议美机轰炸我国货船的强盗行为
    美帝国主义想用炸弹来阻止中国人民对越南人民正义事业的支援，是永远办不到的。中国人民将坚定地同越南人民一道，给美国强盗以更加有力的惩罚
    新华社一日讯　中华人民共和国外交部一日发表声明，声明全文如下：
    一月二十日和一月二十七日，美国强盗飞机先后对我停泊在越南鸿基港的红旗一五二号货船和停泊在锦普港的红旗一五三号货船进行了猖狂轰炸，使我船员多人受伤，船体遭到严重的破坏。这是美帝国主义对中国人民的蓄意挑衅。中国政府和中国人民再次强烈抗议美帝国主义的这种强盗行为。
    我们要正告美帝国主义，你们想用炸弹来阻止中国人民对越南人民正义事业的支援，破坏中、越两国的正常交往，是永远办不到的。美帝国主义对中国人民犯下的罪行，一定要清算。中国人民将一如既往坚定地同兄弟的越南人民一道，给美国强盗以更加有力的惩罚，直到最后彻底打败美国侵略者。
    新华社河内一日电　正在阴谋加强和扩大侵越战争的美帝国主义，在一月二十日和二十七日，又悍然两次出动强盗飞机，袭击正在越南民主共和国鸿基港和锦普港装煤的中国货船。这是美帝国主义继一月三日出动强盗飞机疯狂袭击停泊在越南锦普港的中国货船之后，对中国进行又一次极其严重的军事挑衅。
    一月二十日凌晨四时二十五分，我红旗一五二号货船正在鸿基港装煤时，突然遭到美国强盗飞机的野蛮轰炸，六名船员受伤。
    一月二十七日凌晨零时五十五分，我红旗一五三号货船在锦普港装煤时，又突然遭到美国强盗飞机猖狂袭击。十二枚炸弹在我货船周围爆炸，使船体二十多处遭到破坏。
    美帝国主义在一个月内连续三次悍然轰炸我货船，充分说明了它在侵越战争中连遭惨败，走投无路的困境，同时暴露了它决心与中国人民为敌到底的狰狞面目。
