The recent issue of the *Malaya News* published an article stating that with the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary struggle of the Malayan people has achieved continuous victories over the past year.

The article states: The Malayan National Liberation Army and the people of the guerrilla zones have united and fought bravely, smashing the attacks of American-backed British imperialism and the Malayan puppet regime. Over the past year, the imperialists and their puppets have mobilized thousands of troops to repeatedly attack the Malaya-Thailand border and the northern guerrilla zones of Malaya. The National Liberation Army not only successfully sustained the armed struggle but also strengthened its forces and expanded the guerrilla zones. The National Liberation Army also directly assisted the people in reclaiming barren lands and seizing lands illegally occupied by the authorities, improving the living conditions of the people. These struggles have raised the political consciousness of the people and further strengthened the unity between the armed forces and the people.

The article states: Inspired by the Malayan National Liberation Army's persistent armed struggle, mass struggles in the cities and vast rural areas under enemy occupation have reached a high tide. The nationwide protests against the devaluation of the old Malayan currency, especially the island-wide strike in Penang, have dealt a heavy political blow to the reactionary regime. Despite the enemy's bans, farmers across the country have seized large tracts of land illegally occupied by the authorities. This struggle for land has reached an unprecedented scale and has received the support of workers and intellectuals in various cities.

The article points out: In all these struggles, the broad masses of the people have shown a spirit of daring to fight and daring to win. Although almost every struggle has been met with bloody suppression by the Rahman-Li Siu Loong clique, they dare to fight against the reactionary police, are not afraid of imprisonment, injury, or sacrifice. The mass struggles have proven that the Rahman-Li Siu Loong clique is a paper tiger.

The article states: Today, Malaya (including Singapore) is still a new type of British colony, and due to the decline of British imperialism, the danger of American imperialism replacing British imperialism to enslave the Malayan people has become more serious. The Soviet modern revisionists are also hastening to collude with the Rahman-Li Siu Loong puppet regime, sabotaging the revolutionary struggle of the Malayan people. Therefore, to eliminate the influence of British imperialism and thwart the conspiracy of Soviet revisionists helping American imperialism to replace British imperialism, the Malayan people must overthrow the Rahman-Li Siu Loong puppet regime.

The article emphasizes: To achieve victory in this struggle, it is necessary to adhere to the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle, using revolutionary armed forces to oppose the counter-revolutionary armed forces of American and British imperialists and their running dogs, and using the just war of national liberation to oppose the unjust colonial war of imperialists and their running dogs.

The article concludes: Although the revolutionary road is tortuous and the tasks are arduous, under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party and the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of Malaya will certainly achieve greater successes in the new year.

    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下
    马来亚人民革命斗争不断胜利发展
    民族解放军英勇战斗不断粉碎敌人进攻，扩大游击区；敌占区城乡群众斗争出现高潮
    新华社二十三日讯　《马来亚公报》最近一期发表文章指出，随着战无不胜的毛泽东思想的广泛传播，马来亚人民的革命斗争一年来不断胜利发展。
    文章说：马来亚民族解放军和游击区人民，团结一致，英勇战斗，粉碎了美国支持的英帝国主义和马来亚傀儡集团的进攻。这一年中，帝国主义者及其傀儡纠集了数千人的军队，连续袭击马—泰边境和马来亚北部的游击区。民族解放军不仅成功地坚持了武装斗争，而且增强了力量，扩大了游击区。民族解放军还直接帮助人民群众开垦荒地和夺取官方霸占的土地，改善群众生活条件。这些斗争提高了群众的政治觉悟，进一步加强了武装力量和人民之间的团结。
    文章说：在马来亚民族解放军坚持武装斗争的鼓舞下，敌占区的城镇和广大农村的群众斗争出现了高潮。为反对旧马币贬值而举行的全国性抗议示威，特别是槟榔屿人民举行的全岛罢市，在政治上给反动当局以沉重的打击。广大农民群众不顾敌人的禁令，在全国各地夺取大片官方霸占的土地。这种争取土地的斗争达到了前所未有的规模，并得到了各个城镇的工人和知识分子的支持。
    文章指出：在所有这些斗争中，广大人民群众表现了敢于斗争，敢于胜利的精神。虽然几乎每次斗争都遭到拉赫曼—李光耀集团的血腥镇压，但是，他们敢于同反动的军警搏斗，不怕坐牢，不怕受伤，不怕牺牲。群众斗争证明，拉赫曼—李光耀集团是纸老虎。
    文章说：今天，马来亚（包括新加坡）仍然是英国的新型殖民地，而且由于英帝国主义的衰落，美帝取代英帝来奴役马来亚人民的危险变得更为严重。苏联现代修正主义者也正加紧同拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团勾结，破坏马来亚人民的革命斗争。因此，为消除英帝国主义的影响，粉碎苏修帮助美帝取代英帝的阴谋，马来亚人民必须推翻拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡政权。
    文章强调指出：为了在这场斗争中赢得胜利，必须坚持以农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的道路，以革命的武装反对美英帝国主义者及其走狗的反革命武装，以争取民族解放的正义战争反对帝国主义者及其走狗的非正义的殖民战争。
    文章最后说：虽然革命的道路是曲折的，任务是艰巨的，但是在马来亚共产党的领导下，在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，马来亚革命人民必将在新的一年里取得更大的成就。
