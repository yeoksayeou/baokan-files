The People's Liberation Army, while carrying out the task of supporting the left in the Hongqiao District of Tianjin, has organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in accordance with the different situations in the factories during the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the living thoughts of the masses. They have targeted specific issues in each session, achieving good results.

Their experience shows that conducting study classes in this manner, with a clear focus, definite purpose, concentrated effort, and short duration, yields quick results and solves problems thoroughly. Conducting study classes in this way will make them better and better, and they will be welcomed by the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it. The purpose of mastering it is entirely for application. If you can apply Marxism-Leninism to explain one or two practical problems, then you will be praised and will have achieved some success."

When we conduct study classes, we should follow Chairman Mao's instruction, using his latest directives as the guideline. Through "criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself," we should target specific issues in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our region or unit, pushing the movement forward.

To conduct effective study classes, we must deeply understand and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, constantly study the new situations and trends of class struggle, and, according to the actual conditions of class struggle at the time and place and the living thoughts of the masses, correctly determine the central content of each study class.

Conducting study classes but not seriously using Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems in the movement, or not aiming at the target and firing randomly, is an unprincipled style of study. By eliminating this unprincipled style of study, a lively and targeted good style of study can be promoted, study classes can be conducted better and better, Chairman Mao's latest directives can be implemented, and the problems existing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can be solved one by one.

    办学习班要解决问题
    本报评论员
    在天津市红桥区工业五片执行支左任务的人民解放军，针对各工厂无产阶级文化大革命运动发展的不同情况和群众中的活思想，有的放矢地开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，办一期解决一个主要问题，收到了很好的效果。
    他们的经验证明，这样办学习班，中心突出，目的明确，力量集中，时间短，见效快，解决问题深透。这样办学习班，就会越办越好，受到群众的欢迎。
    毛主席教导我们说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。如果你能应用马克思列宁主义的观点，说明一个两个实际问题，那就要受到称赞，就算有了几分成绩。”
    我们办学习班，就应当遵照毛主席的这个教导，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，通过“斗私，批修”，有的放矢地解决本地区、本单位在无产阶级文化大革命运动中存在的一个两个实际问题，把运动推向前进。
    要办好学习班，就要深刻地领会和紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，随时研究阶级斗争的新形势和新动向，按照当时当地阶级斗争的实际情况和群众中的活思想，正确地决定每期学习班的中心内容。
    办了学习班，但不认真地用毛泽东思想去解决运动中的实际问题，或者不对准靶子，乱放一通，这是一种不正派的学风。去掉了这种不正派学风，生动活泼的、有的放矢的好学风才能发扬，学习班就能越办越好，毛主席的最新指示就能条条落实，无产阶级文化大革命中存在的问题就能一个一个地得到解决。
