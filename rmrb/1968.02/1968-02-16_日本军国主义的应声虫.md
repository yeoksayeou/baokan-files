Just as the Japanese reactionary government led by Sato is stridently advocating for "strengthening the defense consciousness" and "defending one's own country with one's own hands," the revisionist group led by Miyamoto has openly published an article titled "The Security Policy of the Japanese Communist Party," vociferously promoting the idea that "the Japanese nation has always had the right to self-defense to protect its sovereignty and independence from foreign invasion and oppression." Miyamoto's group is marching in lockstep with the Japanese reactionaries.

Miyamoto's group's "self-defense doctrine" is nothing new; it is merely a rehash of the reactionary slogan of "defending the motherland" once championed by the Second International revisionists. Lenin once severely criticized those social chauvinists, pointing out that "they advocate 'defending the motherland' not to oppose national oppression, but to defend the 'rights' of this or that 'great' power to plunder colonies and oppress other nations." Today, Miyamoto's group is playing the same shameful role of defending the rights of Japanese monopoly capital to plunder colonies and oppress other peoples.

Lenin said: "Marxists are by no means generally opposed to 'defending the motherland.'" The Japanese people certainly have the right to defend their national independence and state sovereignty. However, the ones occupying Japanese territory, trampling on Japanese state sovereignty and national independence, and threatening Japanese security are not others but precisely the overlord of the Japanese reactionaries, American imperialism. Miyamoto's group remains silent about American imperialism being the most vicious enemy of the Japanese people and does not mention that the Sato government is a faithful lackey of American imperialism in Japan. Instead, they shout about the "inherent right to self-defense" of the "Japanese nation," clearly advocating for the expansionist and aggressive policies of the Japanese reactionaries!

Under the patronage of American imperialism, the Japanese militarist forces have rapidly revived and are now growing stronger, rapidly expanding their military capabilities, and brazenly conducting external expansion activities. They are also actively following American imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Asia, serving as American imperialism's mercenaries. Recently, the militarist leaders of Japan, such as Sato Eisaku, have frequently issued calls for "defending one's own country with one's own hands," clearly preparing public opinion for the reactionaries' aggressive adventures. Miyamoto's group immediately jumps out to act as the Japanese militarists' echo, singing the tune of "self-defense," truly a perfect match. No wonder Sato hurriedly applauds and praises, satisfactorily declaring that he "approves of the Communist Party's self-defense theory." This praise from the Japanese reactionaries is not the clearest exposure of Miyamoto's group's traitorous face?

### 日本军国主义的应声虫

    日本军国主义的应声虫
    正当日本佐藤反动政府竭力叫嚷要“增强国防观念”、“用自己的手保卫自己的国家”的时候，宫本修正主义集团公然发表所谓《日本共产党的安全保障政策》的文章，大肆鼓吹什么“日本民族从来就有保卫本国的主权和独立不受外来侵略和压迫的自卫权”。宫本集团跟日本反动派的步伐，跟得何其紧也。
    宫本集团的这种“自主防卫论”，并不是什么新发明，它不过是第二国际修正主义者曾经鼓噪一时的所谓“保卫祖国”反动口号的翻版。列宁当时曾经严厉地斥责那些社会沙文主义者，指出“他们主张‘保卫祖国’并不是为了反对异族压迫，而是为了捍卫这些或那些‘大’国掠夺殖民地和压迫异族人民的‘权利’。”今天的宫本集团所扮演的，也正是这样一个捍卫日本垄断资本掠夺殖民地和压迫异族人民的“权利”的可耻角色。
    列宁说过：马克思主义者“决不是一般地反对‘保卫祖国’”。日本人民当然享有保卫民族独立和国家主权的权利。然而侵占日本国土、蹂躏日本国家主权和民族独立、威胁日本安全的，不是别人，恰恰就是日本反动派的太上皇美帝国主义。宫本集团闭口不谈美帝国主义是日本人民最凶恶的敌人，也不谈佐藤政府是美帝国主义在日本的忠实走狗，却大叫大嚷什么“日本民族”的“固有自卫权”，这分明是为日本反动派的扩张侵略政策张目！
    日本军国主义势力在美帝国主义的扶植下迅速复活起来，现在已经羽毛渐丰，正在加紧扩充军备，猖狂地进行对外扩张活动，并且积极追随美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略和战争政策，充当美帝国主义的侵略走卒。日本的军国主义头目佐藤荣作之流近来频频发出所谓“自己保卫自己国家”的叫嚣，正是为日本反动派准备侵略冒险制造舆论。而宫本集团却马上跳出来充当日本军国主义的应声虫，高唱“自主防卫”的滥调，真可谓配合密切。难怪佐藤连忙为之鼓掌喝采，满意地宣称，他“对于共产党的自主防卫论”，“是赞成的”。这种来自日本反动派的赞赏，不是最清楚地暴露了宫本集团的叛徒面目吗？
