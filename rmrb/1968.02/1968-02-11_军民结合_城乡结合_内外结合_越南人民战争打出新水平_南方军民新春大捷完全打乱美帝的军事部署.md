Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and no heroes fear bears and wolves. The comprehensive offensive launched by the people of South Vietnam against the U.S.-puppet clique since the Spring Festival has already achieved stunning results that have shocked the world. The 14 million people of South Vietnam have demonstrated with their extraordinary feats to the world that the long-term people's war of the Vietnamese people has developed to a highly advanced level.

In the past ten days alone, from the northern bank of the Ben Hai River to Cape Vung Tau, from the mountains to the plains, from cities to the countryside, the people of South Vietnam, with the tremendous striking force formed by the unity of military and civilians, urban and rural areas, and internal and external forces, have routed the enemy who had been entrenched in dozens of provincial capitals and cities, hundreds of counties and towns, dozens of enemy airfields, and enemy-occupied rural areas. They have achieved a new situation, a new level, and a new world.

The Spring Offensive has mobilized millions of people in the cities and countryside of South Vietnam to join the battle. The combined strength of the military and civilians to annihilate the enemy is like a sudden storm, a landslide, and an irresistible force, placing the enemy in a deadly situation. In the past ten days, while the liberation armed forces have annihilated the enemy, the people in the enemy-occupied cities and countryside have risen up in support and cooperation with the liberation army, destroying the puppet regime. Millions of military and civilian personnel have worked closely together to sweep away the U.S.-puppet army and the puppet government institutions. Whether in the enemy's stronghold of Saigon or elsewhere, the people's liberation armed forces, with the support and cover of the people, have achieved surprise victories in their attacks. An American general later said in despair, "The residents knew about this (referring to the liberation army's attack on Saigon), but not a word leaked out." In Hue, Dalat, Ban Me Thuot, Qui Nhon, Pleiku, and Vung Tau, when the people's armed forces launched surprise attacks on the enemy, the local residents took control of the streets and pursued the evil-doers of the puppet regime and other American lackeys. In Thua Thien Province, tens of thousands of people in the enemy-occupied areas rose up to sabotage transportation lines, destroy the puppet regime, and besiege and disintegrate the enemy. In many towns, residents seized enemy weapons, established patriotic armed forces, and fought alongside the people's liberation armed forces; smashed enemy ruling institutions, overthrew traitorous puppet governments, and established revolutionary governments. In many enemy-occupied villages, the people wiped out the enemy's village "pacification teams," turning the "pacification zones" that the U.S.-puppet clique had worked so hard to create into nothing, liberating their homes. The victory of the Spring Offensive is a victory achieved by the close cooperation of the entire army and the entire people. It once again proves the great truth pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on the masses." "By mobilizing the entire population, a vast ocean is created to drown the enemy."

During the Spring Offensive, while attacking the enemy, the people of South Vietnam also disintegrated the enemy's forces, winning over many patriotic officers and soldiers of the puppet army, patriotic elements within the puppet regime, and anti-American patriots from various strata to join the ranks of the anti-American, national salvation struggle. This accelerated the disintegration of the puppet army and puppet regime, expanded the anti-American united front, and formed a situation of internal and external attacks on the enemy. In Hue City, the people's liberation armed forces, with the assistance of patriotic officers and soldiers from the people and the puppet army, stormed into the city at the beginning of the battle, dividing and surrounding the enemy, destroying the headquarters of the puppet army's First Division. In the battle to attack the enemy in Ban Me Thuot, the people's liberation armed forces received the assistance of patriotic officers and soldiers from the puppet army's 45th Regiment. In Tuy Hoa City, patriotic officers and soldiers from the 33rd Regiment, 21st Division of the puppet army seized the enemy's ammunition depot, took all the weapons, and joined the people, helping the people's liberation armed forces to occupy many areas of the city and annihilate many puppet police and thugs. In Tuyen Duc Province, a battalion of the puppet army also surrendered to the people. According to preliminary statistics, in eleven provinces alone, 169 outposts and sentry posts of the puppet army soldiers have rebelled and joined the revolutionary ranks. In six days, 200,000 puppet soldiers were disintegrated in various parts of South Vietnam. Due to the large number of puppet regime personnel turning to the light, the puppet government institutions in many places have become paralyzed. Many patriotic organizations established during this revolutionary storm have united anti-American patriots from all walks of life in the enemy-occupied areas, greatly strengthening their own forces and further isolating the enemy.

The Spring Victory has written a glorious new chapter in the history of the Vietnamese people's war. In this powerful offensive, the people of South Vietnam have annihilated a large number of the enemy's combat forces. They annihilated more than 50,000 enemy troops, including more than 10,000 U.S. troops, in six days from January 29 to February 4, which is more than one-third of the enemy annihilated in the entire dry season of 1966-1967. They destroyed or damaged more than 1,500 enemy aircraft, destroyed or damaged a large number of tanks and armored vehicles, and destroyed a large amount of enemy equipment. Even one of the top brass of the U.S. military command in Vietnam, Creighton Abrams, had to admit that the fierce and widespread offensive of the South Vietnamese people had "caught the U.S. forces by surprise," and "this offensive was well-coordinated, fierce, and daring."

The Spring Victory fully demonstrated the flexible strategy and tactics of the South Vietnamese people's liberation armed forces. They commanded the battlefield simultaneously in the mountainous and coastal plains, with the two battlefields closely cooperating and supporting each other. On January 26, the liberation army fiercely annihilated the enemy in the Khe Sanh area, causing the U.S. military to panic and hastily dispatch more than 10,000 troops to reinforce the area. However, just as the enemy was still in shock, at dawn on January 30 and 31, the sound of guns and cannons of the liberation army roared again in dozens of coastal towns. In a very short period, the liberation armed forces not only attacked the enemy's military and political command organs but also raided the enemy's airfields and bases; they not only attacked the enemy in the enemy-occupied cities but also swept away the enemy in the enemy-occupied countryside, making the enemy unable to support each other, completely disrupting the enemy's military deployment, and creating a favorable opportunity to annihilate the enemy's combat forces one by one.

The Spring Victory has laid a more solid foundation for the South Vietnamese people to achieve final victory. It once again fully proves the wise judgment of the great leader Chairman Mao: "No matter how large or small a country is, as long as it fully mobilizes the people, firmly relies on the people, and wages a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

At present, the spring breeze is blowing across the battlefield of South Vietnam, and the dawn is shining on the beautiful mountains and rivers of Vietnam. The heroic people of South Vietnam are advancing in victory. The unwilling-to-surrender American aggressors are making their last struggles. Before achieving final victory, the Vietnamese people still have to go through a difficult journey. However, as our great leader Chairman Mao said in his telegram to President Nguyen Huu Tho, "No difficulty can stop the advance of the revolutionary people. Persistence is victory." Victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people who have made up their minds to fight to the end.

    军民结合　城乡结合　内外结合
    越南人民战争打出新水平
    南方军民新春大捷完全打乱美帝的军事部署
    新华社十日讯　本社记者报道：“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”越南南方军民春节以来向美伪集团发动的全面袭击，已经取得了震惊世界的辉煌战果。一千四百万南越军民以其神奇的战功向全世界表明，长期进行的越南人民战争，已经发展到了一个高度的水平。
    在最近短短的十天内，从边海河南岸到金瓯角，从山区到平原，从城市到农村，南越人民以军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合所形成的巨大打击力量，把盘踞在几十个省会和城市，成百个县城和市镇，几十个敌军机场以及敌占农村里的敌人，打得落花流水，人仰马翻，打出了新的局面，打出了新的水平，打出了新的天地。
    新春攻势，动员了南越城乡千千万万的人民投入了战斗。军民团结歼敌的力量，势如暴风骤雨，山崩海啸，锐不可挡，置敌于死地。在最近十天中，在解放武装力量歼敌的同时，敌占城乡的人民纷纷揭竿而起，支持和配合解放军作战，摧毁伪政权。数以百万计的军民紧密合作，横扫美伪军和傀儡政权机构。不论是在敌人老巢西贡，还是在其它地方，人民解放武装力量由于得到了人民的支持和掩护，在袭击中出奇制胜。一个美国将军事后垂头丧气地说，“居民是知道这件事（指解放军攻打西贡）的，但是却只字未漏”。在顺化、大叻、邦美蜀、芽庄、槟椥、金瓯等许多城镇，当人民武装力量向敌人发起奇袭时，当地居民奋起控制街区，追捕作恶多端的伪政权人员和其他美国走狗。承天省，有数十万敌占区人民起来破坏交通线，摧毁伪政权，围困和瓦解敌人。还有不少城镇的居民夺取了敌人的武器，建立了爱国武装，同人民解放武装力量一起作战；砸烂敌人的统治机构，推翻卖国走狗政权，建立革命政权。在许多敌占村庄，人民把敌人的乡村“绥靖队”一扫而光，使美伪集团费尽心机搞的一些“绥靖区”化为乌有，解放了家园。新春的胜利是全军全民密切结合取得的胜利。它又一次证明了伟大领袖毛主席所指出的伟大真理：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海”。
    在新春攻势中，南越军民一面进攻敌人，一面瓦解敌军，争取了许多伪军爱国官兵、伪政权中的爱国分子和各阶层反美爱国人士参加抗美救国斗争行列，加速了伪军和伪政权的瓦解，扩大了反美统一战线，对敌人形成了内外夹攻的局面。在顺化市，人民解放武装力量在人民和伪军中爱国官兵的协助下，战斗一开始就冲进市区，把敌人分割包围，摧毁了伪军第一师的司令部。人民解放武装力量在进攻邦美蜀敌军的战斗中，得到了伪军第四十五团爱国官兵的协助。在朔庄市，伪军第二十一师第三十三团第二营的爱国官兵占领了敌人的弹药库，携带全部武器投向人民，配合人民解放武装力量占领了城市的许多地区，消灭了许多伪警察和恶棍。在土龙木省也有一营伪军向人民投诚。据初步统计，仅在十一个省就有一百六十九个据点和哨所的伪军士兵起义加入革命队伍。在六天中，在南越各地，共有二十万名伪军被瓦解。由于大量伪政权人员弃暗投明，许多地方的傀儡政权机构陷于瘫痪。在这次革命风暴中建立起来的许多爱国组织，团结了敌占区各阶层反美爱国人士，从而大大有利于壮大自己的力量，进一步孤立敌人。
    新春大捷在越南人民战争史上写下了光辉的新篇章。南越军民在这一声势浩大的攻势中，大歼敌人有生力量。他们在一月二十九日夜间到二月四日的六天中，歼灭了包括美军一万多名在内的敌军五万多人，相当于一九六六——一九六七年整个旱季歼敌数目的三分之一强，击毁击伤敌机一千五百多架，击毁击伤大量坦克和装甲车，摧毁大量敌军装备。连侵越美军司令部的头目之一蔡逊也不得不承认，南越军民的凌厉而广泛的攻势，“使美国部队感到意外”，“这次攻势协调配合好得惊人，猛烈得惊人，大胆得惊人”。
    新春大捷充分表现了南越人民解放武装力量机动灵活的战略战术。他们同时在山区和沿海平原两个战场上，指挥自如。两个战场紧密配合，互相呼应。一月二十六日，解放军在溪山地区猛烈歼敌，使美军吓破了胆，连忙调集上万兵力前往增援，但是，正当敌人惊魂未定之时，一月三十日和三十一日凌晨，在沿海几十个城镇里，解放军的枪炮声又隆隆地打响了。在间隔很短的时间内，解放武装力量既攻打敌人军政指挥机关，又袭击敌军的机场和基地；既进攻敌占城市之敌，又横扫敌占农村之敌，打得敌人顾此失彼，无法互相支援，完全打乱了敌人的军事部署，造成了各个击破敌人、歼灭敌军有生力量的有利战机。
    新春大捷，为南越人民夺取最后胜利打下了更为牢固的基础，它又一次充分证明了伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    目前，春风吹遍了南越的战场，曙光照耀着越南美丽的山河。英雄的南越军民正在乘胜前进。不甘心失败的美国侵略者正在进行垂死挣扎，越南人民在取得最后胜利之前，还要经历艰苦的路程，但是正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席在给阮友寿主席的贺电中所说的：“任何困难都阻挡不住革命人民的前进。坚持下去就是胜利。”胜利一定属于已经下定决心打到底的英雄越南人民。
