According to incomplete statistics from 15 prefectures and cities recently, the province has established a total of 46,400 Mao Zedong Thought study classes in urban and rural areas, with 1,840,000 people participating in the study. With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, Huainan Coal Mine established 2,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes in 20 days, with over 80,000 employees, cadres, and family members participating in the study. Hefei, Ma'anshan, Chao Lake, Lu'an, Chu County, and Xiuzhou established 1,400 Mao Zedong Thought study classes in half a month, with 53,000 people participating in the study. The study classes established in various places are characterized by diverse forms, lively and vivid, closely connected with reality, and tailored to local conditions and individuals. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, with deep class feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, eagerly enter the study classes to learn.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various places in Anhui all take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and use the "Old Five Articles" as the basic textbooks, criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthen proletarian party spirit. They all put forward guarantees: not to do factional things, not to say factional words, not to hold factional meetings, not to spread factional news, and not to write factional slogans, and resolutely fight against factionalism and the "self" in the mind. Everyone follows Chairman Mao's teaching of "each doing more self-criticism" and conducts serious self-criticism. The comrades participating in the study classes, on the basis of eliminating factionalism and strengthening party spirit, concentrate their targets and firepower, and launch a big criticism and struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev and their agents in Anhui.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various places in the province, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, also study Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and his discussions on the mass line, and criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary bourgeois line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" on the cadre issue. Many revolutionary masses enthusiastically help cadres recognize their mistakes and support revolutionary cadres to stand up for revolution. Many cadres, in the study classes, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, correctly treat themselves, correctly treat the masses, actively seek out two factions of revolutionary masses to have heart-to-heart talks, seriously examine their mistakes, and are determined to better unite with the masses to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various places all closely focus on the current struggle reality, emphasizing the resolution of key problems in the region and unit, thereby effectively promoting the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, and driving the development of industrial and agricultural production.

    大大促进全省文化大革命的胜利发展
    据新华社合肥十六日电　安徽省各地大办毛泽东思想学习班，发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，把学习班作为活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂和斗私批修的战场，大力围剿派性，增强党性，大大推进了全省无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。
    据十五个专区和市最近的不完全统计，全省城乡各地共开办了毛泽东思想学习班四万六千四百多个，参加学习的有一百八十四万多人。淮南煤矿在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，二十天办了毛泽东思想学习班两千多个，有八万多名职工、干部和家属参加学习。合肥、马鞍山、巢湖、六安、滁县、徽州等地，在半个月内办起了毛泽东思想学习班一千四百多个，参加学习的达五万三千多人。各地开办的学习班，都具有形式多样、生动活泼、密切联系实际和因地因人制宜的特点。广大工农群众、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，争先恐后地进学习班学习。
    安徽各地的毛泽东思想学习班，都以毛主席的最新指示为纲，以“老五篇”当作基本教材，斗私批修，坚决打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性。他们纷纷提出保证：派性的事不做，派性的话不说，派性的会不开，派性的消息不传，派性的标语不写，坚决同派性和头脑中的“私”字展开斗争。大家遵照毛主席“各自多做自我批评”的教导，进行了认真的自我批评。参加学习班的同志，在消除派性、增强党性的基础上，集中目标，集中火力，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在安徽的代理人展开了大批判、大斗争。
    全省各地的毛泽东思想学习班，在学习毛主席最新指示的同时，还学习了毛主席的干部政策和关于群众路线的论述，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。很多革命群众热情地帮助干部认识错误，支持革命干部站出来革命。很多干部在学习班里，遵照毛主席的教导，正确对待自己，正确对待群众，主动找两派革命群众谈心交心，认真检查自己的错误，决心更好地和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    各地的毛泽东思想学习班，都紧紧围绕当前的斗争实际，着重解决本地区、本单位的关键问题，从而有效地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，推动了工农业生产的发展。
