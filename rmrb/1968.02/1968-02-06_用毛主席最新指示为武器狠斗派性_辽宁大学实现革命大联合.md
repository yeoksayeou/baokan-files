Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the two revolutionary mass organizations of Liaoning University have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have taken "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and on February 3rd, achieved revolutionary great unity. This has created a good beginning for the revolutionary great unity of colleges and universities in Shenyang. The revolutionary great unity achieved by the two revolutionary mass organizations of Liaoning University is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary youngsters of Liaoning University, in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively responded to the battle call of the great leader Chairman Mao, bravely exposed and criticized the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev, and bravely attacked the bourgeois reactionary line, making contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, due to the instigation of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party both inside and outside the school and the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, they have been divided into two factions for a long time, and the antagonistic sentiments have been relatively serious.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations held many study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary great unity. As long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary great unity should be achieved on the basis of revolutionary principles." Both sides actively approached each other and carried out mutual heart-to-heart talks, creating conditions for achieving revolutionary great unity. During the Spring Festival, the leaders of both factions seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related important articles. They unanimously agreed that the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Liaoning Province and Liaoning University is unprecedentedly good and is getting better and better. Achieving revolutionary great unity is an irresistible historical trend and an urgent need to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We proletarian revolutionaries must act swiftly and decisively in response to the battle order of the proletarian headquarters. Thus, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Shenyang Military Region, taking Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, they conducted consultations to achieve revolutionary great unity. In the consultation process, both sides followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Both sides should talk less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others talk about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each side should do more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences." Both sides bravely carried out self-criticism. After full consultation, they finally reached an agreement on February 3rd to achieve revolutionary great unity, establishing the "February 3rd" Red Guards Red Rebel Corps of Liaoning University and the Revolutionary Great Unity Command of Liaoning University Red Guards.

The revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Liaoning University expressed their confidence, saying that they will further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great unity of the entire school, strive to achieve revolutionary three-in-one combination in the shortest time, and launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation. They will use practical actions to promote the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, and make new contributions to winning a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    用毛主席最新指示为武器狠斗派性
    辽宁大学实现革命大联合
    据新华社沈阳五日电　在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，辽宁大学两大革命群众组织紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，于二月三日实现了革命的大联合，为沈阳市大专院校的革命大联合创造了良好的开端。辽宁大学两大革命群众组织实现革命大联合，是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    辽宁大学的无产阶级革命派和革命小将，在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，积极响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号召，勇敢地揭发批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，勇敢地冲击资产阶级反动路线，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了贡献。但是，过去由于校内外的党内一小撮走资派挑动和资产阶级反动路线的影响，长期分成两派，对立情绪一直比较严重。
    毛主席的最新指示下达以后，两派革命群众组织曾多次开办毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合。只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”两派主动接近，互相展开谈心活动，为实现革命大联合创造了条件。春节期间，两派负责人又认真学习了毛主席的最新指示和有关重要文章。他们一致认为，当前辽宁省和辽宁大学的文化大革命形势空前大好，而且越来越好，实现革命的大联合是不可阻挡的历史潮流，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的迫切需要，我们无产阶级革命派对无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，必须闻风而动，雷厉风行。于是，在沈阳部队机关毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，进行实现革命大联合的协商。在协商过程中，双方遵照毛主席“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的教导，勇敢地进行了自我批评。双方经过充分协商，终于在二月三日达成了实现革命大联合的协议，成立了辽宁大学“八三一”红卫兵红色造反团、辽宁大学红卫兵革命大联合指挥部。
    辽宁大学的红卫兵革命小将和革命师生员工满怀信心地表示，要进一步发展和巩固全校的革命大联合，争取在最短时间内实现革命的三结合，掀起斗批改的新高潮，以实际行动来推进辽宁省和沈阳市的革命大联合和革命三结合，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利做出新的贡献。
