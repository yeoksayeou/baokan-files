The Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province held an enlarged meeting from January 18 to 25, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, to seriously summarize the basic experience of power-grasping and power-using over the past year, discuss the combat tasks for 1968, and resolve to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher to strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

January 31 marked the first anniversary of the establishment of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The entire committee, leaders of revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs at various levels, responsible comrades of the support-left troops, and responsible comrades of revolutionary mass organizations from various places, with deep class feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, reviewed the past year's struggle and discussed the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Heilongjiang. Everyone unanimously agreed that every victory achieved in Heilongjiang is the result of the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the glory belongs to the great commander Chairman Mao.

The comrades attending the meeting believed that the most fundamental combat task at present is to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively, and to quickly turn Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the actual actions of the people of the entire province. To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions well, they must first be implemented in the leading cadres at all levels, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions the guiding principle for the revolutionary committees at all levels to grasp and use power. Based on the revolutionary struggle practice over the past year, they summarized five experiences on how to grasp and use power for the proletariat:

1.	Eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most fundamental guarantee for the proletariat to grasp and use power well. Everyone agreed that to grasp and use power well, one must be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the lifeline of the revolutionary committees, and Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the revolutionary committees. Following Chairman Mao is victory. The revolutionary committees have thousands of things and tens of thousands of things to do, but the most important and fundamental thing is to lead the broad masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively.

2.	After the establishment of the three-in-one temporary power organs, class struggle must be firmly grasped, the direction of the struggle must be firmly grasped, and the dictatorship of the proletariat must be consolidated and strengthened. After the proletarian revolutionary factions seized power, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society who have not been reformed are not reconciled to their failure. They are trying every means to undermine the revolutionary three-in-one. Around the issue of power, a fierce class struggle is still going on. Therefore, all disturbances must be eliminated, and the direction of the struggle must be firmly grasped, concentrating forces to launch a big criticism and big struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. The revolutionary big criticism must be closely combined with the various tasks of each period, thoroughly purging the poison of revisionism spread by the handful of capitalist-roaders headed by China's Khrushchev in various fields and lines.

3.	The new temporary power organs must fully rely on the masses, believe in the masses, and thoroughly follow the mass line. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must firmly believe in the majority of the masses, first of all, the basic masses of workers and peasants." The comrades attending the meeting deeply realized that all the work of the revolutionary committees must be placed under the supervision of the masses and consciously accept the supervision of the masses. Many units have created some methods to accept the supervision of the masses, such as inviting the masses "up" or having the leading cadres "go down," which have achieved good results.

4.	The revolutionary three-in-one must be continuously consolidated and strengthened, and the role of the revolutionary three-in-one must be fully played. To fully play the role of the revolutionary three-in-one, the most fundamental thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and guide everything. The members of the revolutionary committees must take Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive, unify their thinking, and old and new cadres must help each other. The People's Liberation Army participating in the revolutionary three-in-one must bring the fine tradition of emphasizing proletarian politics in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one, promoting the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary committees.

5.	Criticizing and repudiating selfishness and revisionism, and preventing arrogance and degeneration, is an extremely important issue raised in the development of the revolutionary situation. Everyone believes that having the word "arrogance" in one's mind is a dangerous signal of beginning to depart from the masses and is a breakthrough for the bourgeoisie to attack the proletarian dictatorship. Everyone is determined to fight against the word "arrogance" as an important part of preventing revisionism and degeneration.

The resolution passed at this enlarged meeting requires all departments and units in the province to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to study, publicize, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions deeply. The organs of the revolutionary committees at all levels should assign half of their personnel to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to urban and rural grassroots levels, to study, publicize, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes should be vigorously established; revolutionary big criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of various units should be carried out deeply; cadres should be correctly treated, and the revolutionary three-in-one should be consolidated and developed; revolution should be grasped, production should be promoted, work should be promoted, and preparedness for war should be promoted. The resolution requires the revolutionary committees at all levels to achieve the revolutionization of the organs through criticizing and repudiating selfishness and revisionism and preventing arrogance and degeneration. The resolution also decides that the revolutionary committees at all levels should seriously implement the principle of "streamlining administration and reducing personnel."

The resolution emphasizes that to further develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolution, the revolutionary committees at all levels must firmly stand on the proletarian party stance, support the left without supporting factions, and increase revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold to prevent the sabotage of class enemies.

The meeting also passed a resolution to immediately launch a new high tide of the "Support the Army, Love the People" movement throughout the province, requiring the movement to be carried out continuously.

The meeting also passed the plan for the development of agriculture in Heilongjiang Province over the next five to seven years and the decision on the development of local industries.

Comrade Pan Fusheng, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, made a report at the meeting.

   黑龙江省革委会扩大会议总结掌权用权经验
   毛泽东思想是革命委员会的灵魂
   要落实好毛主席最新指示，首先要落实在各级领导班子里，使毛主席最新指示成为掌权用权的指针
    据新华社哈尔滨三十一日电　黑龙江省革命委员会在一月十八日到二十五日召开扩大会议，以毛主席最新指示为纲，认真总结一年来掌权、用权的基本经验，讨论一九六八年的战斗任务，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。
    一月三十一日，是黑龙江省革命委员会成立一周年。省革命委员会全体委员、各级革命三结合临时权力机构的领导成员、支左部队的负责人和各地革命群众组织负责人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚阶级感情，回顾过去一年的斗争历程，畅谈了黑龙江省无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。大家一致认为，黑龙江省取得的每一个胜利，都是伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命一系列极为重要的指示落实的成果，光荣属于伟大统帅毛主席。
    参加会议的同志们认为，当前最根本的战斗任务就是要把毛主席的最新指示条条落实、全面落实，把毛主席的最新指示迅速变成全省人民的实际行动。要落实好毛主席的最新指示，首先要落实在各级领导班子里，使毛主席的最新指示成为各级革命委员会掌权、用权的指针。他们根据一年来的革命斗争实践，总结了如何为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的五条经验：
      （一）永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的最根本保证。大家一致认为，要掌好权、用好权，必须无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是革命委员会的生命线，毛泽东思想是革命委员会的灵魂，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。革命委员会有千件事、万件事要做，最重要、最根本的大事就是带领广大群众活学活用毛泽东思想。
      （二）三结合临时权力机构建立以后，必须狠抓阶级斗争，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。无产阶级革命派夺权以后，被打倒的党内一小撮走资派和社会上没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，并不甘心于他们的失败，他们还千方百计妄图瓦解革命的三结合。围绕着政权问题，仍然在进行着一场激烈的阶级斗争。因此，必须排除一切干扰，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，集中力量对党内一小撮走资派展开大批判、大斗争。要把革命的大批判和各个时期的各项任务紧密结合起来，彻底肃清以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派在各个领域、各条战线所散布的修正主义流毒。
      （三）新的临时权力机构要充分依靠群众，相信群众，彻底走群众路线。毛主席教导我们：“必须坚定地相信群众的多数，首先是工农基本群众的多数。”参加会议的同志们深深认识到，革命委员会的一切工作必须置于群众的监督之下，自觉地接受群众的监督。许多单位都创造了一些接受群众监督的方法，如采取把群众“请上来”，或领导干部“走下去”等办法，收到了良好的效果。
      （四）不断地巩固和加强革命的三结合，充分发挥革命的三结合的作用。要充分发挥革命三结合的作用，最根本的是用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切。革命委员会成员要以毛泽东思想为最高指针，统一思想，新老干部要互相帮助。参加革命三结合的解放军，要把活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治的优良传统，带到三结合的临时权力机构中来，促进革命委员会的思想革命化。
      （五）斗私批修，反骄防变，这是革命形势向前发展中提出来的一个极为重要的问题。大家认为，头脑中有了“骄”字，这是开始脱离群众的一个危险信号，是资产阶级向无产阶级政权进攻的一个突破口。大家决心把斗倒“骄”字，当作反修防变的一项重要内容。
    这次扩大会议通过的一项决议，要求全省一切部门、一切单位要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入地学习、宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示。各级革命委员会机关要抽出二分之一的人员组成毛泽东思想宣传队，分赴城乡基层，和广大工农群众同学习、同宣传、同落实毛主席的最新指示。要大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班；要深入开展革命的大批判和各单位的斗批改；要正确对待干部，巩固和发展革命的三结合；要更好地抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备。决议要求各级革命委员会通过斗私批修，反骄防变，实现机关革命化。决议还决定各级革命委员会要认真贯彻“精兵简政”的原则。
    决议中强调指出，为了进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合，各级革命委员会要坚决站在无产阶级党性立场上，支左不支派，百倍提高革命警惕性，严防阶级敌人的破坏。
    会议还做出了在全省范围内立即掀起一个“拥军爱民”运动新高潮的决议，要求把“拥军爱民”运动经常持久地开展下去。
      这次会议还通过了黑龙江省今后五年到七年发展农业的规划和关于发展地方工业的决定。
    黑龙江省革委会主任委员潘复生同志在会上作了报告。
