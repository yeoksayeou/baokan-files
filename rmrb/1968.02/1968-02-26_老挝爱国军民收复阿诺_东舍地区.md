Lao patriotic military and civilians have liberated the Anou-East Xayset region.

KANGPHAN, Feb. 23 (Xinhua) -- According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, at the end of January, the patriotic military and civilians of Laos' Xaisomboun Province launched a fierce attack on the enemy forces occupying the Anou-East Xayset region. They annihilated more than 100 enemy soldiers and re-liberated the region.

The Anou-East Xayset region is an old liberated area of the Lao Patriotic Front. Recently, American aggressors and their lackeys dispatched a large number of troops to occupy this region.

After the Anou-East Xayset region was re-liberated, the local people immediately established guerrilla forces to resolutely defend their homeland.

According to another report, the military and civilians of Xaisomboun and Phongsaly provinces recently launched extensive anti-bandit operations, annihilating 27 enemy soldiers and rescuing more than 1,500 victims who had been imprisoned by the enemy.
