Johnson recently traveled personally to the American West Coast to see off a batch of cannon fodder being sent to South Vietnam. Afterwards, at a press conference, he shouted: "We will continue to support them to the utmost—providing everything (the U.S. invaders in Vietnam) demand, and whatever they might demand in the future"; "if necessary," he would increase the previously set limit on troop increases.

The tone of the American president is quite arrogant. But how much capital does he really have?

American imperialism has already invested nearly half of its ground forces, nearly a fifth of its air force, and a quarter of its navy in the Vietnam War, with a total of over 500,000 troops. However, the brave people of South Vietnam have unleashed the immense power of people's war, defeating the American aggressors and leaving them in a state of disarray. The number of U.S. casualties in Vietnam has been rising steadily, with over 300,000 already killed. This has made Washington's manpower crisis increasingly severe. Last year, the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, had to plead and bargain to get Johnson to agree to increase troops to 525,000 by the first half of this year. However, current facts have fully proven that such a "maximum limit" cannot solve the problem of insufficient U.S. troops in South Vietnam.

The United States has nearly three million armed forces, a number that is certainly not small. However, American imperialism's ambitions are vast, and its lines of aggression are long, with its forces scattered around the world, inherently lacking in manpower. The large-scale increase in troops to South Vietnam has made the contradiction between its aggressive ambitions and manpower shortages even more pronounced. Domestically, it is constrained by the growing awareness of the American people and the black people's struggle against violence, and it cannot but station a considerable number of troops to suppress the people. Therefore, the number of forces it can truly mobilize is quite limited, and it has already had to use its strategic reserve forces. Recently, in order to send an additional 10,500 cannon fodder to South Vietnam, it has even deployed a brigade from the 82nd Airborne Division. This division is usually used to suppress the national liberation movements of the Latin American people and the revolutionary struggles of the American people, known as the "Latin American Strike Force" and the "First Line Federal Troops" emergency force. Regarding this situation, the American International Herald Tribune lamented with concern: "If another emergency occurs outside of Vietnam, the army does not even have a complete infantry division ready for immediate deployment overseas."

The Johnson administration, in order to gather cannon fodder, has been frantically expanding conscription at home, even stooping to lower standards and filling positions with unqualified individuals. Not long ago, it decided to squeeze out 100,000 cannon fodder from those who do not meet the enlistment standards, including the mentally challenged and the infirm; recently, it announced the abolition of exemptions for college graduates, graduate students, and those engaged in "important work." However, Johnson's warmongering actions have further provoked the resistance of the American people. The movement against the Vietnam War in the United States is surging, and more and more American youth are unwilling to go to Vietnam to die, making the manpower of American imperialism increasingly depleted.

In such a desperate situation, Johnson still pretends to have a strong "foundation," claiming to meet all the "needs" of the U.S. troops in Vietnam. Isn't this absurd! How many cannon fodder does the United States really "need" in South Vietnam? An American official once estimated: For the United States to provide South Vietnam with a "complete protective umbrella" that is not subject to attack, "at least eight million troops" are needed. Even if the "need" estimated by this American official is met, can Johnson fulfill it? Obviously not. Johnson is putting on a brave face, trying to calm the situation, but the result is only further exposing the desperate situation of American imperialism in the Vietnam War.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War: "Apart from the basic political and economic contradictions that Chiang Kai-shek cannot overcome, which is the fundamental reason for our victory and his defeat, in military terms, the contradictions between Chiang's broad front and his insufficient forces have already become sharp. This contradiction will inevitably become the direct cause of our victory and his defeat." American imperialism in today's Vietnam War is exactly the same. Apart from facing increasingly severe political and economic crises, the shortage of manpower has already posed an insurmountable threat to it, which will directly lead to its ultimate failure.

    约翰逊究竟有多少本钱？
    郭辛兵
    约翰逊最近亲自跑到美国西海岸，去为调往南越的一批炮灰送行。之后，他在记者招待会上叫嚷：“我们将尽力支持下去——给予（侵越美军头目）要求的一切，以及可能要求的一切”；“如果需要的话”，将提高原定的增兵限额。
    美国总统老爷的口气煞是不小。但是，他究竟还有多少本钱呢？
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中已经投入了它的近二分之一的地面部队，动用了它的近五分之一的空军和四分之一的海军，兵员总数超过五十万。但是，英勇的越南南方军民发挥了人民战争的巨大威力，把美国侵略强盗打得落花流水，狼狈不堪。侵越美军伤亡拾级上升，到现在已被歼三十多万。这就使华盛顿的兵力危机越来越严重。去年，侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰为了搬救兵，费尽唇舌，讨价还价，才从约翰逊那儿得到在今年上半年增兵到五十二万五千人的“最高限额”。但是，目前的事实已经充分证明，这样的“最高限额”，根本解决不了南越战场上美国侵略军兵力不足的难题。
    美国共拥有近三百万的武装部队，这数目当然不算小。但是，美帝国主义的侵略野心大得很，侵略战线长得很，兵力又分散在世界各地，先天就存在着兵力不足的弱点。而南越战场的大量增兵，使它的侵略野心同兵力不足的矛盾更加突出。在国内，它慑于美国人民的日益觉醒和黑人抗暴斗争，又不能不屯驻相当多军队，以镇压人民。因此，美国剩下所能真正调动的力量为数十分有限，现在已不得不动用它的战略后备力量了。它在最近为了往南越增派一万零五百名炮灰，就把第八十二空降师的一个旅也用上了。这个师是一向用来镇压拉丁美洲人民民族解放运动和美国国内人民革命斗争的所谓的“拉丁美洲突击师”和“第一线联邦军队”的应急部队。对于这种情况，美国《国际先驱论坛报》就忧心忡忡地哀叹：“倘使在越南之外发生另一起紧急事件，陆军甚至没有一个完整的步兵师准备好供立即调往海外之用”。
    约翰逊政府为了搜罗炮灰，在国内拚命扩大征兵，甚至不惜降格以求，滥竽充数。前不久，它才决定从不合入伍标准的低能儿和病弱者中挤出十万名炮灰；最近，它又宣布将取消大学毕业生、研究生和“从事重要工作者”的免征办法。可是，约翰逊的这种穷兵黩武的做法，进一步激起了美国人民的反抗。美国人民的反对侵越战争运动正在蓬勃地兴起，越来越多的美国青年不愿去越南送命，美帝国主义的兵源越来越枯竭了。
    在这样捉襟见肘的情况下，约翰逊竟还装作“家底”雄厚的样子，扬言将满足侵越美军的“一切”“需要”，岂不是活见鬼！美国在南越究竟“需要”多少炮灰呢？有一个美国官员曾经这样估计：美国要想为南越提供一个不受攻击的“完备的保护伞”，“至少需要八百万军队”。即使如这位美国官员所估计的“至少”的“需要”，约翰逊能不能满足呢？显然不可能。约翰逊打肿脸充胖子，妄想安定一下人心，结果恰恰只是进一步暴露了美帝国主义在侵越战争中已经濒临山穷水尽的绝境。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在第三次国内革命战争时期说：“除了政治上经济上的基本矛盾，蒋介石无法克服，为我必胜蒋必败的基本原因之外，在军事上，蒋军战线太广与其兵力不足之间，业已发生了尖锐的矛盾。此种矛盾，必然要成为我胜蒋败的直接原因。”美帝国主义在今天的侵越战争中，也正是这样。除了面临日益深重的政治经济危机之外，兵力不足已对它形成了无法克服的严重威胁，必将直接导致它走向最后的失败。
