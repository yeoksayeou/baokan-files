The heroic patriotic military and people of Laos, since the beginning of this year, have displayed the might of the people's war, taking the initiative to launch attacks, liberating strategic locations such as Nam Bao, annihilating a large number of enemy forces, and gaining greater initiative on the battlefield. This has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' plot to expand their aggression.

The victory at Nam Bao is the most significant achievement of the patriotic military and people of Laos in the early dry season. From January 12 to 16, in the battle to liberate Nam Bao, they annihilated over 1,200 enemy troops. With the help of various ethnic groups in the area, they continued to pursue and annihilate the fleeing remnants of the enemy. By January 20, they had achieved the tremendous victory of annihilating approximately 2,000 enemy troops. At the same time as liberating Nam Bao, the patriotic military and people of Laos also launched a fierce attack on the Luang Prabang airport, about 100 kilometers south of Nam Bao, on the night of January 14, destroying 12 enemy aircraft. The enemy troops between Nam Bao and the "royal capital" of Luang Prabang were terrified and fled their positions. The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys hurriedly withdrew troops from other areas to defend Luang Prabang. This is the most glorious victory achieved by the patriotic military and people of Laos since the great victory at Nam Tha in 1962.

Nam Bao is a strategic location in the upper Laos region. The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys have always used Nam Bao as a base for attacking the liberated areas of upper Laos. Recently, they have concentrated a large number of troops in Nam Bao (some of which were transferred from southern Laos), making Nam Bao an important springboard for the U.S. imperialists to expand their aggression across all of Laos. The patriotic military and people of Laos have uprooted this thorn, annihilated a large number of enemy troops, and driven the enemy out of the northern region of Luang Prabang Province. This has disrupted the U.S. imperialists' plans to expand their aggression, throwing them and the right-wing forces of Laos into a state of panic and chaos. The U.S. propaganda machine exclaimed that this is the "most astonishing setback" suffered by the right-wing military of Laos in five years, fearing that this battle would "change the scope and scale of the war in Laos."

The victory at Nam Bao demonstrates that the patriotic military and people of Laos, who hold high the banner of armed struggle against the U.S., have persisted in a protracted people's war, achieving greater victories with each battle. Since the beginning of the dry season last November, the patriotic military and people of Laos have further developed the people's guerrilla warfare, continuously launching attacks on the enemy, and consecutively striking enemy bases, command posts, and airfields. They have fought fiercely at night and annihilated the enemy, achieving the annihilation of over 4,000 enemy troops in just over two months by mid-January. Among these, they completely annihilated four enemy battalions and seven companies, nearly matching the enemy annihilation record of the dry season of 1966-1967, which lasted seven months.

In the battles since the dry season, not only have the main forces of the patriotic military of Laos fought bravely with significantly improved combat effectiveness and increased enemy annihilation, but the guerrilla forces and local troops in various regions have also developed and grown stronger. Apart from actively cooperating with the main forces in combat, they have also thwarted the enemy's "creeping" attacks, protecting the production and construction in the liberated areas. During this period, the patriotic military and people of Laos have also reclaimed many strategic regions that were "crept" by the enemy. Following the liberation of the northern stronghold of Nam Bao, on January 24, the patriotic military and people of Laos also captured the southern border stronghold of Vientiane. Thus, the patriotic military and people of Laos have initially defeated the U.S. imperialists' and their lackeys' military adventurism in the dry season, making the enemy fall into a situation of insufficient troops, low morale, and passive defense. This has once again exposed the paper tiger nature of the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialists in the face of the mighty people's war.

However, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys are not willing to accept their defeat. With the support of the Soviet revisionists, they are hastily plotting to expand the war of aggression. They repeatedly threaten to implement a so-called "pursuit" policy against Laos and Cambodia, continuing to bomb the liberated areas of Laos, frequently sending their lackey troops to invade the liberated areas, and secretly building a strategic road and military airfield in central and southern Laos. They are also secretly constructing an "electronic warning system" called the "barrier zone," plotting to directly send troops into Laos. However, past facts have proven, and future facts will continue to prove, that no matter how high the U.S. imperialists escalate their aggression, the heroic patriotic military and people of Laos will surely defeat the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, and carry out the great struggle of anti-U.S. national salvation to the end.

### 在南博大捷之后乘胜前进  老挝爱国军民打得敌军闻风丧胆  美国宣传机器惊呼老挝右派军队遭到五年来“最惊人的挫折”

    在南博大捷之后乘胜前进
    老挝爱国军民打得敌军闻风丧胆
    美国宣传机器惊呼老挝右派军队遭到五年来“最惊人的挫折”
    新华社三十日讯　本社记者报道：今年年初以来，英雄的老挝爱国军民发挥人民战争的威力，不断主动出击，解放了南博等战略要地，消灭了敌人的大批有生力量，取得了战场上更大的主动权，使美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋遭到了沉重的打击。
    南博大捷是老挝爱国军民在旱季初期取得的最重大的胜利。老挝爱国军民在一月十二日到十六日解放南博的战斗中歼灭敌人一千二百多名，接着又在当地各族人民帮助下，猛打穷追溃逃的残余敌人，到二十日为止，已取得歼敌共约两千人的巨大战果。在解放南博的同时，老挝爱国军民还在一月十四日夜间猛烈袭击南博以南不到一百公里的琅勃拉邦机场，击毁敌机十二架。南博和“王都”琅勃拉邦之间地区的敌军闻风丧胆，纷纷撤出据点逃命。美帝国主义及其走狗慌忙从其他地区抽调兵力防守琅勃拉邦。这是老挝爱国军民自一九六二年南塔大捷以来取得的最辉煌的胜利。
    南博是老挝上寮地区的战略要地。美帝国主义及其走狗一直把南博作为进攻上寮解放区的基地，近来更在南博集结重兵（其中一部分是从老挝南部地区调来的），使南博成为美帝国主义把侵略战争扩大到整个老挝的重要跳板。老挝爱国军民拔掉了这个钉子，消灭了敌军的大批有生力量，把敌军赶出琅勃拉邦省北部地区，这就打乱了美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的部署，使美帝国主义和老挝右派陷入一片惊慌混乱。美国宣传机器惊呼这是老挝右派军队五年来遭到的“最惊人的挫折”，耽心这一仗将“改变老挝战争的范围和规模”。
    南博大捷说明，高举反美武装斗争大旗的老挝爱国军民，坚持持久的人民战争，越打胜利越大。自去年十一月旱季以来，老挝爱国军民进一步开展人民游击战争，不断向敌人发动进攻，接连袭击敌人的基地、指挥所和飞机场，大打夜战、歼灭战，到今年一月中旬的两个多月内就消灭敌人四千多名，其中全歼敌军四个营和七个连，接近一九六六——一九六七年旱季七个月的杀敌战果。
    在旱季以来的战斗中，不仅老挝爱国力量的主力部队作战英勇，战斗水平大大提高，歼敌数量显著增加，同时各地的游击队和地方部队也得到进一步发展壮大。他们除了积极配合主力部队作战外，还粉碎了敌人的“蚕食”进攻，保卫了解放区的生产和建设。在此期间，老挝爱国军民还收复了许多被敌人“蚕食”的战略地区。继解放北部重镇南博之后，一月二十四日老挝爱国军民又攻克南部边界要地会山。这样，老挝爱国军民就初步战胜了美帝国主义及其走狗的旱季军事冒险计划，使敌人更加陷入兵力不足、士气低落、被动挨打的困难境地，使貌似强大的美帝国主义在威力无穷的人民战争面前，再一次现出了它的纸老虎原形。
    但是美帝国主义及其走狗决不甘心于自己的失败。美帝国主义在苏修集团的支持下，正加紧策划扩大侵略战争。它一再叫嚷要对老挝和柬埔寨实行所谓
  “穷追”政策，继续对老挝解放区进行狂轰滥炸，不断派遣它的走狗军队进犯解放区，并且在中、下寮大修战略公路和军用机场，秘密修建一条“电子警报系统”的所谓“障碍地带”，阴谋直接出兵老挝。然而，过去的事实证明，今后的事实仍将证明，不管美帝国主义把侵略战争升到哪一级，英雄的老挝爱国军民，一定会彻底战胜美帝国主义及其走狗，把伟大的抗美救国斗争进行到底。
