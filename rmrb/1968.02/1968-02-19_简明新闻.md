Australian People Protest Against Australian Government's Role as U.S. Imperialist's Accomplice in Aggression Against Vietnam

Hundreds of Australian citizens held a demonstration in the capital, Melbourne, on the evening of the 13th, strongly protesting against the reactionary Australian regime's role as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.

This demonstration took place while Prime Minister Gorton was delivering a speech. Before Gorton arrived at the venue, the demonstrators, holding placards supporting the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, sat in the streets, blocking the entrance to the venue. Gorton slipped into the conference hall through the back door under police protection. The demonstrators then rushed in. When Gorton openly expressed his intention to continue supporting the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, it caused great indignation among the crowd. The crowd shouted slogans: "Immediately withdraw Australian troops!" "End the aggression against Vietnam!"
