Edition: 2

Chairman Mao teaches us: Communists must always be ready to correct mistakes, because any mistake is not in the interests of the people.

	Class A Comrade: After reading your political class, I was greatly inspired. Both of you were able to use the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to attack the "selfishness" in your minds. Using Chairman Mao's thoughts to reflect on my own work, I still have a lot to do, and the "selfishness" keeps appearing. For example, during lunch today, due to carelessness, the 72nd car was off by a size, and it had gone more than twenty meters. When I discovered it, I immediately rolled it up. At that moment, my mind was in a fierce struggle. I thought, it's almost time for lunch, and we're in the middle of a continuous spinning shift. Should I say something or not? If I don't say anything, the problem isn't too big, after all, no one knows, and I can just be more careful next time. If I do say something, I'll have to roll it back one by one, which is so troublesome! Just as I was struggling with these thoughts, Chairman Mao's voice echoed in my ears: "Our responsibility is to the people." "The Communist Party is all about 'seriousness'." Remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, I thought, if I don't say anything about the size being off, can I say I'm taking my work seriously? So, I actively went to the spinning supervisor and had the yarn processed. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mistakes and setbacks have taught us, making us a bit wiser, and our work is done a bit better." I hope you two will also pay attention and avoid such incidents in the future.

	Struggle Hard Against Selfishness and Stir the Soul

	Chairman Mao teaches us: A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and put revolutionary interests first, subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests.

	Class C Comrade: I read your political class and found it very good. Both of you were able to expose your "selfishness," and I learn from you. I also expose my "selfishness" without fear of shame. Today, in the second half of the shift, I thought about slowing down the spinning of the roving. When I saw Shuxue's shift report mentioning "grasp the revolution, promote production," "cotton must be tightened," and "fabric must be tightened," my face turned red. When faced with personal interests, I put revolutionary interests, people's interests, and national interests aside. The main reason is that I haven't studied Chairman Mao's works well enough and haven't struggled hard enough against "selfishness."

	Cherish Human and Material Resources

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Every place must cherish human and material resources and never waste them for short-term gains.

	Class B Comrade: Why did I give you this quote today? The reason is that during the shift, there was half a can of raw sliver, very messy, with many broken ends. I just picked it up and threw it aside. When I opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to give you the shift report, Chairman Mao's teaching "Every place must cherish human and material resources and never waste them for short-term gains" appeared before my eyes. I was startled and said to myself: Isn't Chairman Mao talking about me? I immediately pulled the half can of messy sliver back and used it. Although it broke a few more ends, I put in some extra effort, but my heart was very happy. I think this is not just about joining ends; it is the process of struggling against "selfishness" in my mind, a process of overcoming laziness. Afterwards, I truly felt the boundless power of Chairman Mao's words.

	Struggle Against Selfishness Without a Moment's Rest

	Chairman Mao teaches us: We must struggle against selfishness, criticize revisionism, grasp the revolution, and promote production. We must tighten grain, cotton, and cloth.

	Today, the 58th car of coarse yarn was just leveled, and we were on the middle shift. After taking over the shift, we should have quickly generated the heads and started the machine, but we didn't grasp the time. I thought: If I generate the heads late and start the machine late, I can spin less yarn and have more free time when I go off shift! But I immediately realized that this way of thinking is wrong; "selfishness" has come out again. I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings above, struggled hard against my "selfishness." If we can generate the heads in time and start the machine, we can produce more for the country, and this year's plan can be completed ahead of schedule. Grasp the revolution and promote production, every minute and second must be used to struggle against "selfishness," drive "selfishness" out the door, and let Mao Zedong Thought take root in my mind.

    狠狠地斗私  破私立公
    彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改
    毛主席教导我们：共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。
    甲班同志：看了你俩交的政治班，使我很受启发。你们二人都能用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，来向自己头脑中的“私”字开火。……用毛主席的思想来对照我自己的工作，做得还很不够，“私”字还是不断地出现。比如今天头吃饭时，由于不细心，七十二号车错了尺，过了二十多米，当时我发现后就打了卷。这时我脑子里展开了激烈的斗争，我想现在又正是连纱，又快吃饭了，是说还是不说呢？不说问题也不太大，反正谁也不知道，以后多加注意就是了。说了以后，还得一个个地倒，这多费劲呀！正在思想斗争时，毛主席的声音响在自己的耳边：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”“共产党就最讲‘认真’。”想起毛主席的教导，心想，错了尺还不想说，这能说对工作负责吗？所以我又主动地找到了落纱长，才把纱处理了。毛主席教导我们：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”希望你们二位也要注意，避免以后也发生这类事情。

      狠斗私字　猛触灵魂
    毛主席教导我们：一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；……
    丙班同志：我看了你俩交的政治班，很好，都能亮自己的“私”字，我也向你们学习，亮私不怕丑。今天后半班，我曾经想这罗纱落慢点，在下班时就不落了。当我看到淑蕊交班写到“抓革命，促生产”，“必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”时，我的脸直发烧，遇到个人利益，就把革命利益、人民利益、国家利益，置之脑后，这主要原因是我还未学好毛主席著作，斗
  “私”字不狠。

      爱惜人力和物力
    毛主席教导我们：任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。
    乙班同志：今天我为什么要给你交这段语录呢？原因是，在班上的时候有半筒生条子，很乱，断头特别多，我就把这半筒子捏下来了扔在一边。当我翻开《毛主席语录》，想给你交班时，毛主席的“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费”的教导出现在我眼前，我心里一惊，自言自语地说：毛主席不是在说我吗？！……我马上把半筒乱条子拉过来用上了。虽然多断了几个头，我出了点力，但是心里却很高兴。我认为这不是接头的问题，这是毛泽东思想在我脑子里和“私”字斗争的过程，是斗怕艰苦的过程，事后我真正体会到毛主席的话威力无穷。

      斗私分秒不能停
    毛主席教导我们：要斗私，批修。
    抓革命，促生产。
    必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧。
    今天粗纱五十八号车刚平完车，我们上中班，接班后应该抓紧时间，快生头开车，可是没有抓紧。自己想：如果晚生头，晚开一会车，到下班可以少落一罗纱，多轻闲呀！可是，我马上想这种做法是错误的，
  “私”字又出来了。想到了毛主席的上面的教导，狠斗了自己的“私”字。如能及时地生齐头开车，多给国家生产一点，今年的计划就能提前完成，抓革命，促生产，就要抓紧每一分钟。这时我和其他同志便急忙生好了头，吃饭前把车开了。这时我体会到：每分钟、每秒钟都要斗私，把“私”字扫地出门，让毛泽东思想在自己头脑中扎根。
