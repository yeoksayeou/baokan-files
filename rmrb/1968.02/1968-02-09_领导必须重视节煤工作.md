Title: Leaders Must Attach Importance to Coal Conservation

Recently, I visited many factories to understand their coal usage situations. I saw that many units' leaders attach great importance to coal conservation work. They start from strengthening ideological and political work, mobilizing the masses to contribute ideas and strategies, with everyone paying attention to conservation. Some units even formed specialized teams to strengthen the leadership of coal conservation work, achieving significant results in a short period. However, there are also some units where the leaders do not pay enough attention, resulting in poor coal conservation work and high coal consumption. For example, in one factory, after the boiler room workers studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on conserving and revolutionizing, they repeatedly requested the leadership to reform equipment and strengthen the leadership and management of coal conservation work. However, the factory leaders ignored these requests. The carbon content in the ash of this factory's boilers has always been high. In another factory, a few leaders passed the buck to each other and did not seriously lead the coal conservation work, resulting in coal burning without a plan, "burning when there is coal, demanding when there is none." In the first fifty days of the heating period, they burned seventy-five percent of the planned coal for the entire winter heating.

I feel that to fully implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "conserving to revolutionize," the leaders must first attach importance to it. "If there is only the enthusiasm of the masses but no powerful leading cadres to appropriately organize the masses' enthusiasm, then the masses' enthusiasm will neither be sustained nor will it move in the correct direction or reach a higher level." I hope that the leaders of each unit will seriously attach importance to this work, strengthen leadership, and actively launch a mass coal conservation movement.

    领导必须重视节煤工作
    最近，我到许多工厂了解用煤情况，看到有不少单位领导干部很重视节煤工作。他们从加强思想政治工作入手，广泛发动群众出谋献策，人人注意节约，有的还组成了专门班子，加强对节煤工作的领导，在短期内取得了很大成绩。可是，也有些单位由于领导不够重视，节煤工作就做得很差，耗煤量很高。如有个厂，锅炉房职工学习了毛主席关于节约闹革命的一系列指示后，曾多次要求领导改革设备，加强对节煤工作的领导和管理，但厂里领导干部却不理睬这些要求。这个厂锅炉炉灰的含炭量一直很高。还有个工厂，几个领导干部互相推托，不认真领导节煤工作，以致烧煤一直没有计划，“有煤就烧，无煤就要”，在取暖期的前五十天，就烧掉了全冬暖汽计划用煤的百分之七十五。
    我感到要全面落实毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，首先就必须领导重视。“如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”希望各单位的领导同志认真重视这项工作，加强领导，积极开展群众性的节煤运动。
