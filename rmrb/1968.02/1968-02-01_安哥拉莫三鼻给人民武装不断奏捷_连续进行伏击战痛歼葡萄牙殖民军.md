The armed forces of the Angolan people, led by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), have achieved continuous victories in their guerrilla warfare against the Portuguese colonial forces. From last October to the beginning of this year, these forces have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy in both manpower and materiel.

According to a report from the UNITA office in Cairo, from October to December last year, the Angolan liberation forces engaged in four battles with the enemy. On the 5th, in the Sangundu region, six Portuguese soldiers were captured, and the Portuguese forces suffered heavy casualties. On the 10th, in the northeastern region of Serpa Pinto, eighteen Portuguese soldiers were killed and twenty-eight were wounded, with a significant amount of military equipment seized. On the 13th, in an ambush in the Upper Kuvitu and Kanganba regions, twelve Portuguese soldiers were killed and eight were wounded, with a large quantity of military equipment captured. On the 30th, in a fierce battle in the Luanda region, fifty enemy soldiers were killed and two were captured.

In November, the UNITA guerrillas fought three battles. On the 4th, in the Massadu region, four enemy soldiers were killed, three were wounded, and one was captured. On the 13th, in the Serpa Pinto region, an ambush was set up against a Portuguese colonial force, resulting in twenty-two enemy soldiers killed and thirty wounded, with a large number of guns and military supplies seized. On the 25th, in the Lukula River region, five enemy soldiers were killed.

At the beginning of this year, the UNITA armed forces achieved new victories in Serpa Pinto.

As the armed struggle of the Angolan people continues to flourish, the Portuguese colonial forces are increasingly unable to control the strategic highlands and key areas of Angola. The UNITA reiterated in its report that it is determined to continue the armed struggle to the end.

According to a report from Mozambican freedom fighters in Dar es Salaam on January 26, last November, freedom fighters active in the northern Delagoa Bay province of Mozambique continued to engage in ambushes and mine warfare against the enemy, inflicting heavy casualties.

The report states that in this province, in areas such as Namruchia, Mukojo, Nakutukuta (near Diaca), and on the Ngololo-Mituda road, the freedom fighters set up ambushes against the enemy. In the Namruchia ambush, eight enemy soldiers were killed. In Mukojo, five enemy soldiers were killed. In Ngololo, the guerrillas killed twelve Portuguese soldiers.

The mine warfare was concentrated in the Ngololo and Muydembe regions, resulting in ten enemy deaths and fifteen injuries. On November 18, a company of Portuguese colonial forces set out from the Ngololo military outpost to attack a base of the Mozambican guerrillas. The guerrillas at the base allowed the enemy to enter and then launched a surprise attack, killing about fifteen enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy soldiers, carrying their wounded, attempted to retreat to the outpost. However, when they reached the village of Likualika, they were ambushed again by the guerrillas at the base, and many enemy soldiers were killed. When they retreated to Namkuta, this invading enemy force was ambushed by another guerrilla unit. As a result, an entire platoon of the enemy force was annihilated.

    连续进行伏击战痛歼葡萄牙殖民军
    据新华社开罗三十日电　据争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟驻开罗办事处三十日发表的战报说，从去年十月到今年年初这一期间，这个联盟领导的安哥拉解放武装力量连续胜利地袭击了葡萄牙殖民军，使敌人在人力物力方面遭到重大损失。
    战报说，去年十月，这个联盟领导的安哥拉解放武装力量同敌人打了四仗：五日，在桑贡杜地区，俘虏葡萄牙士兵六人，葡萄牙军伤亡很大；十日，在塞尔帕平托东北地区，打死葡萄牙士兵十八人，打伤二十八人，缴获一批军事装备；十三日，在上库维图和坎甘巴地区的伏击战中，打死葡萄牙士兵十二人，打伤八人，缴获大量军事装备；三十日，在罗安达地区的一次激战中，打死敌军五十人，俘虏两人。

    战报说，今年年初，争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟的武装力量在塞尔帕平托取得了新的胜利。
    战报说，随着安哥拉人民武装斗争的蓬勃发展，葡萄牙殖民军已越来越无法控制安哥拉这部分地区的战略高地和主要地区。争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟在战报中重申：它决心将武装斗争进行到底。
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　据莫三鼻给自由战士一月二十六日在达累斯萨拉姆发表的一项战报说，去年十一月份，活动在莫三鼻给北部德尔加多角省的自由战士，继续对敌人进行了伏击战和地雷战，使敌人遭到沉重伤亡。
