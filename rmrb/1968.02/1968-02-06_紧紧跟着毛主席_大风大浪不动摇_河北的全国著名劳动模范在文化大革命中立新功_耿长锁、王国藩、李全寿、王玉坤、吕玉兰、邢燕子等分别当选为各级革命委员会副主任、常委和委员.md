Closely Following Chairman Mao: Unshakable in Storms and Waves

The renowned national labor models of Hebei Province in the Cultural Revolution have made new achievements.

Geng Changsuo, Wang Guofan, Li Quanxu, Wang Yukun, Lü Yulan, and Xing Yanzi have been elected as vice chairpersons, standing committee members, and members of various levels of revolutionary committees.

The national renowned agricultural labor models of Hebei Province, Geng Changsuo, Wang Guofan, Li Quanxu, Wang Yukun, Lü Yulan, and Xing Yanzi, who are active learners of Chairman Mao's works, have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, actively played leading, backbone, and bridge roles, closely connected with and united the broad revolutionary masses, and made new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have now been elected as vice chairpersons, standing committee members, and members of provincial, prefecture, and county revolutionary committees.

	Leading the Charge in Class Struggle

	“Lead in everything, but most importantly, lead in revolution.” Labor models are not only the vanguards on the production front but also the pioneers in class struggle. They have carried forward the spirit of “daring to defy the emperor and pull him off his throne,” bravely fighting against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in various regions of Hebei Province.

	Geng Changsuo, a national renowned agricultural labor model who has fought on the path of agricultural cooperation for 25 years, exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism at various historical stages with his personal experiences of class struggle between two lines. He not only participated in denunciations and criticisms with revolutionary masses in his locality but also wrote over 40 big-character posters sent to prefectures, provinces, and the central government to expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Under his leadership, the cadres and members of the Wugong Commune in Raoyang County, young and old, actively participated in the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminating the poison of China's Khrushchev in rural areas.

	In 1955, Chairman Mao, in his report “On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation,” praised the agricultural production cooperative established by the poor peasants Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang of Nanwang Village, Anping County. Chairman Mao said: “The direction represented by these three poor peasants is the direction of the 500 million peasants in the whole country.” This heroic cooperative model greatly boosted the morale of poor and lower-middle peasants nationwide and played a significant role in promoting national agricultural cooperation. The class enemies hated and feared it to death. They had long been plotting and shooting in the dark, attempting to destroy it. During the Cultural Revolution, they seized the opportunity to stir up trouble, trying to uproot the red flag personally raised by Chairman Mao. They spread rumors and slandered, saying that the “cooperative of three poor peasants is fake,” inciting some uninformed masses to attack the national labor model Wang Yukun.

	In the midst of the stormy waves, Wang Yukun first thought of the “direction of the 500 million peasants in the whole country” rather than his personal safety. He recalled the scene of sitting happily next to Chairman Mao at the banquet in the Zhongnanhai on the evening of February 7, 1956, and Chairman Mao's patient instructions, instantly gaining boundless courage and strength! Late at night, he found his old comrades-in-arms Wang Xiaoqi and Wang Xiaopang, excitedly telling them: “We must keep our composure, stand firm, and withstand the pressure! We must follow Chairman Mao's words and care about state affairs. Now the class enemies want to negate the ‘direction of the 500 million peasants in the whole country,’ we must fight to the end!” Wang Yukun and his comrades-in-arms, in front of the broad masses, refuted the class enemies' various fallacies with ironclad facts and stern words, timely exposing their tricks. After several major debates, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants saw more clearly, distinguished right from wrong, united closely, and smashed the class enemies' arrogant attacks, ensuring the smooth progress of the Cultural Revolution in Nanwang Village.

	Lü Yulan, the secretary of the Party branch of Dongliushan Village, Xiazhuang Commune, Linxi County, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, was not swayed, tempted, defamed, or discouraged during the Cultural Revolution. She fought alongside the broad poor and lower-middle peasants against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, in collusion with the ghosts and snakes in society, instigated uninformed masses to politically persecute Lü Yulan under various pretexts. However, Lü Yulan, who had always followed Chairman Mao's words for over a decade, remembered Chairman Mao's teaching in the sharp and complex class struggle: “All reactionaries are paper tigers,” bravely standing on the front line of the struggle and fighting face-to-face with the class enemies alongside the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. She alone wrote over 100 big-character posters exposing and criticizing.

	Leading the Way in Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

	The labor models, with their profound class feelings of unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, led the way in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, they closely combined the most prominent and urgent problems in the revolution and production of their regions, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and mobilized the broad masses of commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, effectively promoting revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations. Now, the revolutionary committees have been established in the prefectures and counties where these labor models are located.

	Wang Guofan, the president of the “bare-sticks cooperative” praised by the great leader Chairman Mao as “the image of our entire country,” a national renowned agricultural labor model, remembered Chairman Mao's teaching on correctly treating cadres, visited four communes, and mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants to actively help rural grassroots cadres shoulder the burden of revolution and production. To promote the early establishment of the county revolutionary committee, he took the initiative to visit the county-level organs of Zunhua County, had several discussions with the heads of bureaus and offices, and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them, focusing on class education, carrying out bitterness activities, encouraging them to go to the masses, and achieve new merits for the people, quickly making over 80% of the heads of bureaus and offices stand out.

	The former acting secretary of the county committee of this county, in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and, under the threat of a few bad elements, arbitrarily announced the expulsion of Wang Guofan from the Party. Wang Guofan, with the overall situation in mind, did not hold personal grudges, actively talked to this cadre for three days and two nights, helping him remove the fear, raise awareness, and correct mistakes and errors. Wang Guofan sincerely said: “You are afraid and implement the bourgeois reactionary line, expelling me from the Party, I do not blame you, we should direct our hatred towards China's Khrushchev.” Later, this cadre systematically checked his mistakes and errors in various aspects at a meeting of several thousand people in the county, obtaining the understanding of the broad revolutionary masses and being elected as the chairman of the Zunhua County Revolutionary Committee.

	Leading the Way in Revolution and Production

	The labor models responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to “grasp revolution and promote production,” leading the broad masses of commune members to channel the surging enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture.

	Nangundonggou Brigade in Ping Mountain County is a red banner in the style of Dachai. The commune members, following the collective path indicated by Chairman Mao, with the spirit of moving mountains and changing the sky, dug through winding mountain channels and built terraced fields, turning dry land into irrigated land, barren land into fertile land, small plots into large plots, and low-yield into high-yield, transforming the barren valley into a prosperous socialist new countryside. Over the past decade, grain production has increased steadily. Per mu yield increased from 200-300 jin in the early days of liberation to 1,090 jin in 1964. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party attempted to strike down the enthusiasm of the broad masses in building socialism, saying that the yield was not genuine. They sent people to measure the land and quantity of production, but the facts gave them a resounding slap. These fellows, still unwilling to give up, forcibly decided that the “achievements of Nangundonggou should not be reported for three years.” The poor and lower-middle peasants of Nangundonggou resisted this anti-socialist black wind, turning hatred into strength, and worked even harder to produce. During the Cultural Revolution, they increased the per mu yield of grain to over 1,200 jin for two consecutive years, creating the highest level in history.

	What power enabled them to achieve a double harvest in revolution and production? Labor model and Party branch secretary Li Quanxu said: “It is Chairman Mao who showed us the direction, and it is Mao Zedong Thought that gave us the strength.” Under Li Quanxu's leadership, the commune members of Nangundonggou actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, making it a common practice. Every corner of the village, every field, every courtyard, was a classroom for studying Chairman Mao's works and a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will turn into a powerful material force. The team leader of the fourth production team, Li Erbao, is a famous iron man. In the past, he had been injured three times for collective production. During the Cultural Revolution, he still took the lead in everything and shouldered the heaviest burdens. Whether it was digging canals, building dams, or leveling land, he went wherever it was the most difficult and laborious. He said: “Chairman Mao teaches us to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and I will grasp the revolution and promote production!” Last winter, the broad masses of Nangundonggou, under Li Quanxu's leadership, with surging revolutionary enthusiasm, day and night opened mountains and cultivated fields on the treacherous high mountains, expanding ten mu of irrigated land from the cracks in the rocks, laying a solid foundation for an even greater harvest in 1968.

	Leading the Way in Continuous and Voluntary Revolution

	The labor models followed Chairman Mao's teaching of “not eating old capital but creating new merits,” treating themselves as both the motive force and the object of the revolution. They, with the spirit of continuous revolution, humbly became students of the masses, deeply entered the masses, seriously examined their own shortcomings and mistakes, promoted the revolutionization of thought, and further strengthened their ties with the broad revolutionary masses.

	The labor models deeply understood that all past achievements were the results of Mao Zedong Thought and were achieved through the collective wisdom and strength of the masses. Therefore, they not only remained humble when praised and did not lose heart when criticized but also actively conducted self-criticism, sparking revolution in their souls. The 68-year-old Geng Changsuo repeatedly wrote big-character posters welcoming criticism from the masses; Wang Yukun and Lü Yulan actively went to the masses to make inspections; Wang Guofan and Li Quanxu visited every poor and lower-middle peasant household to seek opinions. Their spirit of voluntary revolution was warmly supported, encouraged, and helped by the broad revolutionary masses, who helped them paste big-character posters all over the streets, making them tempered again in the crucible of the revolutionary mass movement.

	Xing Yanzi, a returned educated youth and deputy secretary of the Party branch of Sigezhuang Brigade, Baodi County, rarely heard criticism in the past and was often praised. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the masses pasted a few big-character posters on her, making her feel she couldn't take it. Later, she repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching of “we Communists should weather the storms and see the world,” recalling her growth process, further realizing that there had always been a struggle between two lines in the issue of cultivating revolutionary successors. In the past, Chairman Mao had received her three times, encouraging her to integrate with workers and peasants, take root, blossom, and bear fruit among the masses. However, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party wanted to turn her into a bourgeois successor. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang went to Baodi County twice to spread poison, wanting the returned educated youth to read and write novels, become writers, and poison the youth with fame and wealth. Xing Yanzi thought of Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions and the facts of class struggle, deeply feeling that to be a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, one must always follow Chairman Mao's words and walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants, forever being a student of the masses. When she understood that the masses' criticism was a help to her, she immediately wrote a big-character poster welcoming criticism from the masses, actively checked her shortcomings and mistakes to the masses, humbly listened to the masses' criticism, and actively stood out to grasp revolution and promote production. The commune members said: “Look, our Xing Yanzi is flying again!”

    紧紧跟着毛主席　大风大浪不动摇
    河北的全国著名劳动模范在文化大革命中立新功
    耿长锁、王国藩、李全寿、王玉坤、吕玉兰、邢燕子等分别当选为各级革命委员会副主任、常委和委员
    本报讯　河北省的全国著名农业劳动模范、学习毛主席著作积极分子耿长锁、王国藩、李全寿、王玉坤、吕玉兰、邢燕子等，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极发挥带头作用、骨干作用、桥梁作用，密切联系和团结广大革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中立下了新的功劳。现在，他们已分别被推选为省、地、县革命委员会副主任、常务委员、委员。
          带头做阶级斗争的闯将
      “千带头，万带头，最主要的是带头革命。”劳动模范们既是生产战线上的尖兵，更是阶级斗争的闯将，他们发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏精神，向党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在河北省各地区的代理人进行了英勇的斗争。
    在农业合作化道路上战斗了二十五年的全国著名农业劳动模范耿长锁，以他亲身经历的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的事实，愤怒地揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在各个历史阶段妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他不仅在本地和革命群众一起进行控诉和批判，还写了四十多张大字报寄到地、省和中央，揭发和批判党内一小撮走资派的罪行。在他带动下，饶阳县五公公社的干部社员、男女老少，积极参加革命大批判，从各方面肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在农村的流毒。
    一九五五年，毛主席在《关于农业合作化问题》的报告中，表扬了安平县南王庄大队贫农王玉坤、王小其和王小庞举办的农业生产合作社。毛主席说：“这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。”这个英雄合作社的榜样，大长了全国贫农、下中农的志气，对推动全国实现农业合作化起了很大的作用。阶级敌人对它恨得要死，怕得要命，他们长期以来耍阴谋、放暗箭，企图把它搞垮；在文化大革命中，他们又乘机兴风作浪，妄图拔掉毛主席亲自树立的这面红旗。他们造谣诬蔑，胡说什么“三户贫农的合作社是假的”，煽动一些不明真相的群众，围攻全国劳动模范王玉坤。
    在黑风恶浪中，王玉坤首先想到的不是个人的安危，而是“全国五亿农民的方向”。他想起一九五六年二月七日晚上，在怀仁堂的宴会上，幸福地坐在毛主席身旁的情景，想起毛主席对他的谆谆教导，顿时，浑身增加了无穷的勇气和力量！深夜，他找到自己的老战友王小其、王小庞，激动地对他们说：“我们要沉住气、站得稳、顶得住！我们一定要听毛主席的话，关心国家大事。现在阶级敌人要否定‘全国五亿农民的方向’，我们要斗争到底！”王玉坤和他的战友们在广大群众面前，以铁的事实，严词驳斥了阶级敌人所散布的种种谬论，及时戳穿了他们的阴谋诡计。经过多次大辩论，广大贫农下中农更加擦亮了眼睛，明辨了是非，紧密地团结起来，粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，保证了南王庄大队的文化大革命的胜利进行。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、临西县下堡寺公社东留善固大队党支部书记吕玉兰，在文化大革命中不被拉拢，不受利诱，不怕造谣中伤，不怕困难挫折，同广大贫农、下中农一起，向党内一小撮走资派猛烈开火。无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，党内一小撮走资派伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神，挑动不明真相的群众，借故对吕玉兰进行政治迫害。但是，十多年来一贯听毛主席的话的吕玉兰，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，牢记毛主席关于“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”的教导，勇敢地站在斗争第一线，和广大贫农下中农一起，同阶级敌人展开了面对面的斗争。她一个人就写了一百多张揭发批判的大字报。
    带头做落实毛主席最新指示的模范
    劳动模范们以对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，带头落实毛主席的最新指示。他们在解放军帮助下，紧密结合本地区革命和生产中最突出最迫切的问题，举办毛泽东思想学习班，发动广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。现在，这些劳动模范所在的地、县，都分别成立了革命委员会。
    被伟大领袖毛主席誉为“我们整个国家的形象”的“穷棒子社”的社长、全国著名的农业劳动模范王国藩，牢记毛主席关于要正确对待干部的教导，走了四个公社，发动贫农下中农积极帮助农村基层干部，挑起抓革命促生产的重担。为了促进县革命委员会的早日建立，他主动到遵化县县级机关，找科局长一级的干部多次座谈，和他们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，狠抓阶级教育，开展忆苦活动，鼓励他们到群众中去，为人民立新功，很快使百分之八十以上的科局长一级干部站了出来。
    这个县的前县委代理书记，在文化大革命运动初期，执行了资产阶级反动路线，在少数坏人威逼下，曾擅自宣布开除王国藩的党籍。王国藩以全局利益为重，不记个人恩怨，主动找这个干部谈话，谈了三天两夜，帮助他去掉“怕”字，提高认识，改正缺点和错误。王国藩恳切地说：“你‘怕’字当头，执行了资产阶级反动路线，开除了我的党籍，我不怨你，我们要把仇恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上。”后来，这个干部在全县几千人的大会上，系统地检查了各方面的缺点和错误，得到广大革命群众的谅解，被选为遵化县革命委员会的主任。
        带头做抓革命促生产的模范
    劳动模范们响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，带领广大社员群众，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到夺取农业生产丰收上去。
    平山县南滚龙沟大队是一面大寨式的红旗。社员们沿着毛主席所指引的集体化道路，以愚公移山、改天换地的英雄气概，凿通了一道道的盘山渠道，建起了一块块水平梯田，旱地变水地，沙地变良田，小块变大块，低产变高产，把贫瘠的山沟建设成了富裕的社会主义新农村。十多年来，粮食产量直线上升。亩产由解放初期的二三百斤跃进到一九六四年的一千零九斤。党内一小撮走资派妄图打击广大群众建设社会主义的积极性，胡说什么产量不实，他们派人来丈土地、量产量，但事实给了他们一个响亮的耳光。这些家伙仍不甘心，又强行作出“南滚龙沟的事迹三年不准登报”的决定。南滚龙沟的贫农、下中农，顶住了这股反社会主义的黑风，化仇恨为力量，更加奋发图强，积极生产。在文化大革命期间，连续两年把粮食亩产提高到一千二百多斤，创造了历史上的最高水平。
    是什么力量使他们夺得革命和生产双丰收呢？劳动模范、党支部书记李全寿说：“这是毛主席给我们指引了方向，是毛泽东思想给了我们力量。”在李全寿的带动下，南滚龙沟社员们活学活用毛主席著作蔚然成风。村边地头、院内院外，到处是学习毛主席著作的课堂，开展革命大批判的战场。毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成强大的物质力量。第四生产队队长李二保，是个有名的铁汉子。过去，他为集体生产曾三次负伤。在文化大革命中，他仍然处处打头阵，挑重担。修渠筑坝，凿山整地，哪里最艰苦，哪里最劳累，他就到哪里干。他说：“毛主席教导我们要挑起革命和生产两副重担，我就是要狠抓革命，猛促生产！”去年冬天，南滚龙沟广大社员，在李全寿带领下，以冲天的革命干劲，在险峻的高山上，日夜开山辟田，从石头缝里扩大了十亩水浇地，为夺取一九六八年的更大丰收打下了坚实的基础。
    带头做不断革命、自觉革命的模范
    劳动模范们遵循毛主席“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，既把自己当作革命的动力，又把自己当作革命的对象。他们以不断革命的精神，甘当群众的小学生，深入到群众中去，认真检查自己的缺点错误，促进了思想革命化，更加密切了和广大革命群众的联系。
    劳动模范们深深懂得，过去的一切成就都是毛泽东思想哺育的成果，是依靠群众集体智慧和力量取得的。因此，他们不仅能够在赞扬声中不自满，在受到批评时不气馁，而且能够自觉地进行自我批评，在灵魂深处爆发革命。六十八岁的耿长锁多次写出大字报，欢迎群众批评；王玉坤、吕玉兰主动到群众中去作检查；王国藩、李全寿挨家挨户地到贫农、下中农家里征求意见。他们的自觉革命的精神，受到了广大革命群众的热情支持，鼓励和帮助他们把大字报贴满了街头，使他们在革命群众运动的熔炉里，又一次受到锻炼。
    回乡知识青年、宝坻县司各庄大队党支部副书记邢燕子，过去很少听到批评，经常受到表扬。文化大革命运动初期，群众给她贴了几张大字报，就感到受不了。后来，她反复学习毛主席关于“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面”的教导，回想起自己的成长过程，进一步认识到在培养革命接班人问题上，从来就存在着两条路线的斗争。过去，毛主席曾经三次接见过她，鼓励她与工农相结合，在群众中生根、开花、结果。可是，党内一小撮走资派却想把她变成资产阶级接班人。反革命修正主义分子周扬，两次到宝坻县去放毒，要下乡知识青年多看小说，写小说，成为文学家，用名利地位毒害知识青年。邢燕子想起毛主席的亲切教导和阶级斗争的事实，深深体会到，要做无产阶级革命事业接班人，就要永远听毛主席的话，走与工农相结合的道路，永远做群众的小学生。当她懂得了群众的批评，正是对自己的帮助时，立即写出欢迎群众批评的大字报，主动向群众检查了缺点和错误，虚心听取群众的批评，积极站出来抓革命、促生产。社员们说：“看，咱们的邢燕子又飞起来了！”
