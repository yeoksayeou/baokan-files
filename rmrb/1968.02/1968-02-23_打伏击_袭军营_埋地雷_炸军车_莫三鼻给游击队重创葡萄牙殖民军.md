Mozambican guerrillas have launched a series of attacks since last December, inflicting heavy losses on the Portuguese colonial forces.

According to reports, from January 15 to 29 this year, the Mozambican guerrillas carried out a series of ambushes and assaults. They shot down one enemy aircraft, killed 28 Portuguese colonial soldiers, and almost completely destroyed two important Portuguese colonial military outposts in Delgado Province, seizing a large amount of military supplies.

Last December, the guerrillas intensified their ambushes and mining activities against the Portuguese colonial forces in the northern Niassa Province, dealing a severe blow to the enemy. The guerrillas laid mines in the areas around Mavaco, Luatize Road, and the Chambadzi stronghold, destroying three trucks carrying Portuguese soldiers. On December 12, the guerrillas ambushed a Portuguese colonial military convoy traveling from Vila Cabral to Massangulo, destroying one truck and killing eight Portuguese soldiers.

On December 16, the guerrillas ambushed near the Malawian border at the foothills of Mount Chiponga, killing three Portuguese colonial soldiers and wounding five. In another ambush two days later, the guerrillas killed and wounded many Portuguese soldiers.

On December 13, the guerrillas also attacked the Portuguese military camp at Msangula.
