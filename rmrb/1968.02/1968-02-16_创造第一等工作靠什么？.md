Reading the news from Xingguo is exhilarating and inspiring.

Over thirty years ago, our beloved great leader Chairman Mao personally commended the red banner of Xingguo County in Jiangxi Province. Today, this banner is once again flying high and waving in the wind before our eyes!

In his brilliant work "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," Chairman Mao highly praised the work done in Xingguo County during the revolutionary base period. Chairman Mao said, "The comrades of Xingguo have created first-class work, and we should commend them as model workers." Chairman Mao also said, "They are working earnestly there, solving problems carefully." He praised the workers of Changgang Township in Xingguo County as "model workers of Changgang Township, respectable workers of Changgang Township!"

Thirty years later, the people of Xingguo, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, have, in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, rapidly achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and established the county revolutionary committee. From the very first day of its establishment, this new revolutionary power organ, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory," has set for itself a lofty goal and high standards of work: to create first-class work like the revolutionary forebears and strive to be model workers.

What does it take to create first-class work? It relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, on the boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, on intensively studying Chairman Mao's works, and on intensively promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the comrades of Xingguo County did the first thing: they went to the old site of the "Land Revolution Cadres Training Class" personally organized by Chairman Mao—Wenchang Palace—to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works. The first task they took on was to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the county and carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism. The comrades of Xingguo County did this completely correctly. They have taken the right path!

In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party committed the greatest crime of not promoting the study of Chairman Mao's works, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing socialism, attempting to restore capitalism. Thus, they gradually slid into the quagmire of counter-revolutionary revisionism, becoming a pile of filth despised by humanity.

The revolutionary committees born in the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. No matter how complex the situation, we must grasp the essence, highlight Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, and promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. This is a matter of great importance for the long-term prosperity of our socialist motherland.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The growth of any new thing is bound to encounter twists and turns. In socialist construction, if one wants to avoid difficulties and twists and turns and achieve success easily without great effort, this is just a fantasy."

Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, be as loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao as the comrades of Xingguo, work earnestly, solve problems carefully, diligently and conscientiously, and wholeheartedly serve the people. On our respective posts, let us create first-class work achievements!

    创造第一等工作靠什么？
    本报评论员
    读了兴国通讯，令人无限兴奋、无限鼓舞。
    三十多年前，我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自表彰过的江西省兴国县这面鲜艳的红旗，今天，又在我们眼前高高飘扬，迎风招展！
    毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》这篇光辉著作中，曾经对当年的苏区兴国县的工作，给予了高度的评价。毛主席说：“兴国的同志们创造了第一等的工作，值得我们称赞他们为模范工作者。”毛主席还说：“他们是认真地在那里进行工作，他们是仔细地在那里解决问题”。并且称赞兴国县长冈乡的工作人员是：“模范的长冈乡工作人员，可尊敬的长冈乡工作人员！”
    三十多年后的今天，具有光荣革命传统的兴国人民，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速地实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，建立了县革命委员会。这个新生的革命权力机构，从成立的第一天起，就遵循毛主席关于“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，给自己提出了一个崇高的奋斗目标和高标准的工作要求：要象革命前辈那样，创造第一等的工作，争当模范工作者。
    创造第一等的工作靠什么？靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，靠大抓狠抓毛主席著作的学习，靠大抓狠抓人的思想革命化。
    兴国县的同志们，在革命委员会成立以后作的第一件事，就是到当年毛主席亲自举办“土地革命干部训练班”的旧址——文昌宫，学习毛主席的光辉著作。他们抓的第一项工作，就是在全县大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命的大批判。兴国县的同志们，这样做是完全正确的。他们的路子走对了！
    过去党内一小撮走资派，他们的最大罪恶，就是不抓毛主席著作的学习，反对毛泽东思想，反对社会主义，妄图实行资本主义复辟。这样，他们就一步步地滑到反革命修正主义的泥坑，成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中新生的革命委员会，就应当无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。无论怎样千头万绪，一定要抓住根本，一定要突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化。这是关系到我们社会主义祖国千秋万代永不变色的一件大事。
    毛主席教导我们说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，象兴国的同志们那样，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，认真地进行工作，仔细地解决问题，勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业，全心全意为人民服务，在各自不同的岗位上，创造出第一等的工作成绩来！
