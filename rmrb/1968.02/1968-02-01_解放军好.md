	The PLA is great

	It was still last spring. A certain unit of the PLA needed straw to make beds and planned to borrow or purchase some from the 7th Brigade. This put Brigade Commander Wang Zhisheng in a difficult position, as there was little rice grown, and all the straw had been used up. There was no straw left in the production teams' yards, only corn stalks and cotton stalks, which couldn't be used for bedding. What to do? Usually, they shouted, "Love the PLA! Support the PLA!" Now that a specific problem had arisen, what should be done?

	This brigade was built with the support of the PLA, constructing a large water gate to resist seawater infiltration, achieving saltwater to freshwater conversion, planting rice, and eating rice. Before liberation, due to the plunder of the "three tyrants" (landlords, salt lords, and fishery lords), the sea dikes were not maintained, and saltwater flooded in. Not only was there no rice to eat, but even finding a straw to use as a "sample" was extremely difficult. Comparing the past with the present, the old and new societies are like heaven and earth. It is truly: "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, ten thousand good things are not as good as the PLA!"

	When Commander Wang thought of this, he discussed with each household, and everyone proposed to take out part of the straw from each family to help the PLA. Everyone said: "The PLA fights for us poor and lower-middle peasants, protects the country, and supports a little straw, what's the big deal?" "The PLA is our border defense Great Wall, the reliance of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we must firmly support them!" In this way, more than 800 pounds of straw were quickly gathered. Commander Wang Zhisheng led a few team members, carrying the "support the army, love the people" banner, and delivered the straw to the troops' camp. When the troops learned that these hundreds of pounds of straw came from the revolutionary masses, they were moved and said: This is not just ordinary straw, but a "golden quilt" sent by the revolutionary masses.

    解放军好
    还是去年春天的事情。解放军某部需要稻草铺床铺，打算向七大队商借或购买。这件事可难住了大队长王志生同志，因为水稻种得少，收的稻草不多，都用光了。各生产队场头上没有现存稻草，仅有玉米秸和棉花秸，那是不能铺床的。怎么办？平时喊着：“热爱解放军！帮助解放军！”现在遇到具体问题该怎办？
    这个大队就是在解放军支援下建成了大水闸，抵制海水渗透，实现了咸改淡，栽上了水稻，吃上了大米。解放前，这里由于“三霸”（地霸、盐霸、渔霸）掠夺，海堤失修，咸水倒灌，不要说吃大米，就连找根稻草做“标本”也难上难。想从前，看今朝，新旧社会两重天，真是：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好没有解放军好！”大队长想到这里，就和各户商量，大家提出把各家的稻草抽出一部分来帮助解放军。大家说：“解放军为我们贫下中农打天下，保江山，支援一点稻草算得了什么？”“解放军是我们边防的长城，贫下中农的靠山，我们要坚决支持她！”就这样很快凑齐了八百多斤稻草。王志生同志带领几个社员，打着“拥军爱民”的旗子，挑送到部队宿营地。当部队同志了解到这几百斤稻草的来源时，感动地说：这不是一般的稻草，而是革命群众送来的“金丝被”。
