	Chairman Mao, we miss you day and night!

	— A Record of Border Guards on the Himalayas

	The soldiers of the Tibet border defense troops, who guard day and night on the snow-capped Himalayas, cherish deep feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They often sing passionately:

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!
	You are the brightest red sun in our hearts;
	The border guards miss you day and night,
	From afar, we wish you eternal life!

	In the dense forests and high mountains of the Himalayas, there is a border post. Initially, there were only two Chairman Mao badges in the post, sent by Red Guards from the distant capital. Who should wear the badges? After much discussion, everyone agreed: whoever is on duty wears them. The soldier on duty, wearing the shining Chairman Mao badge, feels incredibly happy and warm. They say, “Wearing the Chairman Mao badge is like having Chairman Mao standing by my side, feeling full of strength.”

	One day, the clerk of the post, He Jianhua, went to the sentry post and asked the soldier on duty to take off the badge he was wearing. He looked at it again and again. That night, under the dim light of a pine oil lamp, He Jianhua carefully carved a wooden portrait of Chairman Mao using pear wood and camphor wood. After more than a month of meticulous carving, the first wooden portrait of Chairman Mao was completed, and then he carved a second one.

	The border guards guarding the icy peaks and cliffs of the Himalayas regard their posts as battle stations to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They say: We are separated from Beijing by thousands of mountains and rivers, but no matter how many rivers and mountains there are, they cannot separate the border guards' hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. We are on the snow-capped mountains, but our hearts are with Tiananmen Gate. Every red heart is with Chairman Mao. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will fight there.

	A certain border detachment that guards the China-Sikkim border and has repeatedly distinguished itself in repelling Indian military provocations had no houses or tents when they went up the mountain. They lived in caves and slept on stone slabs.

	In August and September, the China-Sikkim border is rainy and overcast. The caves they lived in leaked badly in the rain. During heavy rain, they had to set up rain covers inside the caves. The soldiers couldn't sleep, so they sat together and studied Chairman Mao's quotations: “What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade does.” The more they studied, the more strength they felt. During the rainy season, many soldiers slept every night with wet blankets and stood guard in wet clothes. They said, “To guard for Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, no matter how hard it is, it feels sweet.”

	In the depths of winter, the Tibetan plateau becomes a silver world. In the ice and snow, a border detachment braves the wind and snow to guard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution day and night along the border. On snowy nights, the accumulated snow collapses their tents made of rain covers. They huddle together, using their overcoats to shield themselves from the wind and snow, studying quotations and telling stories of the Red Army's arduous journey over the snow-capped mountains and grasslands. They say: Chairman Mao's works are like a red lantern, shining brightly on the mountain top; soldiers who read Chairman Mao's books have a clear direction even on the snow-capped mountains. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to establish the idea of serving the people completely and thoroughly, and to stand guard on the snow-capped mountains for life.

### 毛主席啊，我们日夜想念您！——记守卫在喜马拉雅山上的边防战士

    毛主席啊，我们日夜想念您！
    ——记守卫在喜马拉雅山上的边防战士
    日日夜夜守卫在白雪皑皑的喜马拉雅山上的西藏边防部队战士们，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情，经常纵情歌唱：
    毛主席啊，毛主席！
    我们心中最红的红太阳；
    边防战士日夜想念您，
    我们在遥远的地方祝您万寿无疆！
    在喜马拉雅山山高林密的地方，有一个边防站。起初，这个站里只有两枚毛主席像章，还是红卫兵小将从遥远的首都寄来的。两枚像章谁戴呢？议来议去，最后大家一致决定：谁站岗谁佩戴。站岗的战士戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章，感到无比幸福和温暖。他们说：“主席像章戴身上，就象主席站在我身旁，感到浑身是力量。”
    一天，站里的文书何建华，走到岗哨前，要求岗哨把佩戴的像章取下来，他看了又看。晚上，在松油灯下，何建华聚精会神地用梨木和香樟木刻毛主席像。经过一个多月的精雕细刻，第一个毛主席的木刻像刻成了，接着他又刻了第二个。
    守卫在喜马拉雅山冰峰雪崖上的边防战士们，把自己的哨位，看成是保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战斗岗位。他们说：我们离北京千重山万道水，但是万水千山也不能隔开边防战士无限忠于毛主席的红心。我们身在雪山上，心向天安门，颗颗红心向着毛主席，毛主席指到哪里，我们就打到哪里。
    一支守卫在中锡边界，在反击印军挑衅中屡立战功的某边防分队，上山时，没有房子，也没有帐篷，他们就住在石洞里，睡在石板上。
    八九月的中锡边境，阴雨连绵。他们住的石洞，大雨大漏，小雨小漏。下雨时，他们在石洞里还得撑起雨布。战士们没法睡，就围坐一起，学习毛主席语录：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”大家越学越感到有力量。在雨季，许多战士就这样天天盖着湿被子睡觉，穿着湿衣服站岗，他们说：“为保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命而站岗，再苦也觉得甜。”
    隆冬，西藏高原成了一片银色世界。在冰天雪地里，一支边防分队，顶风冒雪，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，日夜在边境上巡逻。在大雪纷飞的夜晚，积雪把他们用雨布搭起的帐篷压塌了，他们就蹲在一起，用皮大衣盖在头上挡风雪，一边学语录，一边讲当年红军爬雪山过草地艰苦奋斗的故事。他们说：主席著作是红灯，红灯高照雪山顶；战士读了主席书，身在雪山方向明。他们决心按照毛主席的教导，树立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想，在雪山上站一辈子岗。
