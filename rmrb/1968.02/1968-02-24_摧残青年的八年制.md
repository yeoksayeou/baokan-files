The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in 1966: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue." However, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, in order to cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie, vigorously advocate for long school systems, extensive reading, and "high quality." The Chinese Khrushchev said, "A few universities can enroll some outstanding students for further study," "It can be a few years, as long as the quality is not reduced." Under the guidance of this thought, the so-called "small pinnacle" of China Medical University has become a typical example of the Chinese Khrushchev's devastation of youth and talent.

The school system of China Medical University is as long as eight years, which is extremely rare even in many capitalist countries. A person from primary school to graduation from medical school takes twenty years, and by the time they graduate, they are nearly thirty years old. The most vigorous and active years of one's life are spent entirely in the classroom, studying so-called theoretical knowledge, and being isolated from the working people. How can such a person meet the needs of the working people? How can this not produce revisionism?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without correct political views, it is like having no soul." However, the handful of capitalist roaders within the medical school do not promote the study of Chairman Mao's works, do not focus on ideological education, and use heavy coursework to suppress proletarian politics, making students rarely participate in political movements. Some students have been poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev, "with ears deaf to outside affairs, and a heart only for professional books." What proletarian politics, what fate of the country, what future of humanity, all are thrown to the clouds.

Within the school, the handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois intellectuals within the Party implement a policy of dictatorship over students and adopt a high-pressure policy in studies. In the medical school, it is rare for students not to stay up all night studying. Sometimes, after staying up all night, they return to find the dormitory doors closed. Classmates, in order to cope with their coursework, often have very little time to eat, and some would buy an extra steamed bun the night before to eat for breakfast the next day. Bourgeois intellectuals, in order to confine students to the small world of professional studies, can force a classmate to rewrite a large medical record eight times. They also use grades to confine students. In the medical school, the percentage system is precise to two decimal places, even using computers to calculate. Their goal is to turn students into slaves of grades, slaves of books, and successors of the bourgeoisie who only follow the orders of these bourgeois intellectuals. In these long eight years, they learn a lot of knowledge that has nothing to do with medicine, supposedly a "strong foundation of natural sciences," which they forget as soon as they learn it.

Under such heavy coursework pressure, the school pays extremely little attention to physical education. In the medical school, there is not even a sports research office, and even a small playground was built by the students themselves during their holidays after repeated requests. The students' health condition is not good.

"Neglecting proletarian moral education, emphasizing bourgeois intellectual education, and canceling the most basic physical education," this is the evaluation of the eight-year medical school by revolutionary classmates. The Sixteen Points point out: "Reforming the old educational system, reforming the old teaching principles and methods, is an extremely important task of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This eight-year system that devastates young students must be thoroughly criticized and thoroughly reformed!

    摧残青年的八年制
    中国医科大学七年级革命同学
    伟大领袖毛主席在一九六六年指出：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”但是，党内最大的一小撮走资派，为了培养资产阶级接班人，就拚命鼓吹长学制，多读书，“高质量”。中国赫鲁晓夫说：“可以搞一两个大学招一些优等生深造”，“该几年就几年，总之质量不要降低。”在这种思想指导下炮制出来的所谓“小宝塔尖”——中国医科大学，成为中国赫鲁晓夫摧残青年、摧残人才的典型。
    中国医科大学的学制长达八年，这在许多资本主义国家也是极少有的。一个人从小学读到医大毕业就要花二十年时间，毕业出去将近三十岁了。一生中精力最充沛、思想最活跃的宝贵青年时代，被整天关在课堂里，读那些所谓理论知识，同劳动人民相隔绝。这样培养出来的人，怎能符合劳动人民的需要呢？这怎么能不出修正主义呢？
    毛主席教导我们说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”可是，医大党内一小撮走资派不开展学习毛主席著作运动，不注意思想教育工作，用繁重的业务课来冲击无产阶级政治，使学生很少参加政治运动。有些学生中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读业务书。”什么无产阶级政治，什么国家的命运，人类的前途，都抛到九霄云外去了。
    学校里党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子对学生实行专政，学习上采取高压政策。在医大，学生不开夜车是稀奇的事，有时开夜车回去太晚，宿舍的大门都关了。同学们为了应付功课，常常连吃饭的时间都很紧张，有的就头一天晚上多买一个馒头当第二天的早饭。资产阶级知识分子为了把学生束缚在业务学习的小天地里，可以强迫一个同学把一份大病历重复写八遍。他们还用分数束缚学生，在医大，百分制竟精确到小数点后面两位，甚至用计算机来计算。他们的目的就是把学生变成分数的奴隶，变成书本的奴隶，变成唯这些资产阶级知识分子的命是从的资产阶级接班人。在这漫长的八年里，学了很多和医学毫不相干的所谓“强大的自然科学基础”知识，学过后就忘得一干二净。
    在这种繁重课业压力下，学校又极端不重视体育活动。在医大根本就没有体育教研室，就连一个小小的操场，还是同学们再三争取、利用假期自己修起来的。学生健康状况不佳。
    “忽视无产阶级的德育，突出资产阶级的智育，取消起码的体育”，这就是广大革命同学对八年制医大的评语。十六条指出：“改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教学方针和方法，是这场无产阶级文化大革命的一个极其重要的任务。”这种摧残青年学生的八年制，必须彻底批判，彻底改革！
