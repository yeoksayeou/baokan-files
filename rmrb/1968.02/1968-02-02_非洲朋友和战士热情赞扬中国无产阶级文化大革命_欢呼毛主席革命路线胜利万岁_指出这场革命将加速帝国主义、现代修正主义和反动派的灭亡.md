Some African friends and fighters recently spoke to Xinhua News Agency correspondents, enthusiastically hailing the decisive victories of the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A friend from Congo (Brazzaville) said: The unprecedented Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution has transcended the borders of China and become a major event of world historical significance. All the peoples of the world will draw from this movement an inexhaustible supply of instructive revolutionary experience.

This friend pointed out: At present, the Chinese revolutionary masses are showing great enthusiasm in holding classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, in order to raise their political consciousness and, through unremitting efforts, achieve comprehensive victory in the Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economics, and organization.

He pointed out: "The Cultural Revolution has timely raised the issue of purifying and rectifying the Party organization according to Chairman Mao's proletarian line of building the Party. This is to ensure that the red fortress of the international proletariat—China—will never change color politically, and to create the necessary conditions in terms of ideology and organization."

He highly praised Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the army and loving the people," saying: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a class army that carries out the political tasks of the proletariat and is the main pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a genuine people's army. 'Supporting the army and loving the people' is an instruction of great political significance, which helps to consolidate national defense and the achievements of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Another friend from Congo (Brazzaville) said: The magnificent Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently unfolding in China demonstrates to the world that the Chinese people, armed with the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, possess boundless and invincible power. The Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved splendid victories in all fields.

He pointed out: The Chinese revolutionary masses are using an iron broom to sweep out the likes of the Chinese Khrushchev completely and thoroughly. The revolutionary people of Congo (Brazzaville) support the call to "welcome the comprehensive victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's instructions are the sole guarantee for the smooth progress and comprehensive victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

He concluded with a passionate cry: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

A Congolese (Brazzaville) worker who often studies Chairman Mao's works said: The helmsman steers the ship, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Now, in countries still suffering from the brutal aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, living in poverty and slavery, all oppressed peoples must arm themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They are firmly convinced that their struggle against the common enemy of all the peoples of the world will surely be victorious.

When talking about the Chinese people's extensive promotion of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, he pointed out: With the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought among workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, all of China is presenting a magnificent scene of revolutionary vigor. As Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Chairman of the State, pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the masses, will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atomic bomb of tremendous power."

Many friends from Congo (Brazzaville) expressed: "We firmly believe that the revolutionary peoples of the world, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will achieve even more brilliant victories in 1968, thereby accelerating the downfall of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries."

Two fighters from Congo (Leopoldville) said that 1968 will be the year when the Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieves comprehensive victory throughout China, and it will also be a year of further development for the worldwide anti-imperialist struggle and world revolution.

One of the Congolese (Leopoldville) fighters said: "We joyfully and enthusiastically respond to the battle cry against U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, reactionaries in various countries, and all their lackeys in the world. We fighters on the western front of Congo (Leopoldville) must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions to mobilize, organize, and arm the broad masses of the people, and lead the broad masses of the people to launch an offensive against the counter-revolutionary strongholds in Congo (Leopoldville)."

He believed that to vigorously advance the armed struggle of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people, patriotic armed fighters must, on the one hand, seriously study contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to transform their own thinking; on the other hand, they must widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people. He said: We must eliminate the enemies and all the bad elements in our society. As long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, we can make mountains bow their heads and rivers change their course. We believe that as long as the Congolese (Leopoldville) people adhere to the correct direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, they can, through a long and arduous struggle, achieve comprehensive victory over the domestic and foreign reactionary forces as well as over U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism. These two Congolese (Leopoldville) fighters emphasized that the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution will achieve comprehensive victory in 1968. This victory is the source of the victorious advance of the world revolution and the oppressed nations. They concluded with a passionate cry: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live the armed struggle of the Congolese people!"

A friend from Cameroon said that in 1967, the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution, advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, achieved great victories in the political, economic, and cultural spheres.

This friend from Cameroon stressed: "All the victories achieved by the Chinese people in the Proletarian Cultural Revolution are also the victories of the revolutionary peoples of the world. They are a great encouragement to all the peoples of the world who are struggling for a bright future. These achievements have made China stronger, thus making China an impregnable base for the world revolution. These achievements are all due to the peak of Marxism-Leninism—the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the sole sharp weapon for the revolutionary peoples of the world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries."

He said: "The revolutionary peoples of the world, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are firmly convinced that the final victory belongs to them."

Bobby Mark, the representative of the Botswana People's Party in Cairo, said: The revolutionary peoples of the world are watching with great admiration the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is shaking the world. It is a great contribution to the common struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

He said: All of China is becoming a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. In factories, people's communes, and the army, everyone is studying Chairman Mao's works and Mao Zedong Thought with questions in mind. Through the active application of Mao Zedong Thought, the production of Chinese industry and agriculture has significantly improved.

He pointed out: The Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only thoroughly smashed the plots of the Chinese Khrushchevs and prevented the restoration of capitalism in China but also further spread Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world.

Mark said: The oppressed peoples of Africa are learning and gradually mastering Mao Zedong Thought to be able to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and reactionaries. Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our path forward. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressed peoples of the world and all revolutionaries.

    指出这场革命将加速帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的灭亡
    新华社三十一日讯　一些非洲朋友和战士最近分别向新华社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性的胜利。
    刚果（布）一位朋友说：史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命运动，超越了中国的范围，已成为具有世界历史意义的一件大事，全世界人民将从这个运动中吸取充满教益的取之不尽的革命经验。
    这位朋友指出：目前中国革命群众对举办毛泽东思想学习班表现极大的热情，以便提高他们的政治觉悟水平，从而以坚持不懈的努力，从思想上、政治上、经济上和组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    他指出：“文化大革命及时提出了根据毛主席的无产阶级建党路线纯洁和整顿党的组织的问题，这也是为使国际无产阶级的红色堡垒——中国在政治上永不变色，创造思想上和组织上的条件。”
    他高度评价毛主席发出的“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，他说：“中国人民解放军是一支执行无产阶级的政治任务的阶级军队，是无产阶级专政的主要支柱。它是一支真正的人民军队。‘拥军爱民’是具有重大政治意义的一项指示，有助于巩固国防和无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果。”
    刚果（布）的另一位朋友说：目前正在中国展开的气势磅礴的无产阶级文化大革命向全世界表明，用光辉的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，有着无穷无尽的不可战胜的力量。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命已在一切领域中取得辉煌的胜利。
    他指出：中国革命群众正在用铁扫帚把中国赫鲁晓夫之流完全彻底地扫除干净。刚果（布）革命人民支持“迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利”的号召。光辉的毛泽东思想和毛主席的指示是使无产阶级文化大革命顺利前进并取得全面胜利的唯一保证。
    他最后热情地高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    一位经常学习毛主席著作的刚果（布）工人说：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。现在，在仍然遭受美帝国主义及其走狗残酷侵略、过着贫穷和奴隶的生活的国家的一切被压迫人民，要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来。他们坚信他们反对全世界人民的共同敌人的斗争必将取得胜利。
    他在谈到中国人民大办毛泽东思想学习班时指出：随着毛泽东思想在工人、农民和革命知识分子中的广泛传播，全中国正呈现一片革命朝气的壮丽景象。正如林彪副主席所指出的：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”
    许多刚果（布）朋友表示：“我们坚决相信，用毛泽东思想武装起来的全世界革命人民，在一九六八年将获得更加辉煌的胜利，从而加速帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派的灭亡。”
    两位刚果（金）战士说，一九六八年将是中国无产阶级文化大革命在全中国取得全面胜利的一年，也是全世界反美斗争和世界革命进一步发展的一年。
    其中的一位刚果（金）战士说：“我们兴高采烈地和满怀豪情地响应反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、各国反动派和它们在世界上的一切走狗的战斗号令。我们刚果
  （金）西线战士必须坚决贯彻毛主席关于动员广大人民群众、组织广大人民群众和武装广大人民群众的指示，领导广大人民群众向刚果（金）的反革命基地发动进攻。”
    他认为，为了大力推进刚果（金）人民武装斗争，爱国武装战士一方面自己要认真学习当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，改造自己的思想；另一方面，要在刚果（金）广大人民群众中广泛传播毛泽东思想。他说：我们必须消灭敌人和我们社会上的一切坏蛋。我们只要用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能使高山低头，河水让路。我们相信，刚果（金）人民只要坚持毛主席所指出的正确方向，就能通过长期的、艰巨的斗争，取得对国内外反动势力以及对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的全面胜利。这两位刚果（金）战士强调指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命将在一九六八年取得全面胜利。这个胜利是世界革命和被压迫国家的胜利进军的源泉。他们最后高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线万岁！”“刚果人民的武装斗争万岁！”
    一位喀麦隆朋友说，在一九六七年中，沿着毛主席指引的道路前进的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在政治、经济、文化等方面都取得了伟大的胜利。
    这位喀麦隆朋友强调指出：“中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的这一切胜利，也是全世界革命人民的胜利，是对正在为争取美好前途而斗争的全世界人民的巨大鼓舞。这些成就使中国更加强大，从而使中国成为世界革命的不可攻克的基地。这些成就都归功于马克思列宁主义的顶峰——战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的唯一的锐利武器。”
    他说：“以毛泽东思想为指针进行武装斗争的全世界革命人民坚信，最后胜利是属于他们的。”
    贝专纳人民党驻开罗代表波比·马克说：世界革命人民怀着极其钦佩的心情注视着震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命，它是对反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和各国反动派的共同斗争的巨大贡献。
    他说：全中国正在变成毛泽东思想的大学校。在工厂、人民公社、部队里，人人都带着问题自觉地学习毛主席著作和毛泽东思想。通过活学活用毛泽东思想，中国工农业的生产显著地提高了。
    他指出：中国无产阶级文化大革命不仅彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫之流的阴谋，防止了在中国复辟资本主义，而且还进一步在全世界传播了毛泽东思想。
    马克说：非洲的被压迫人民正在学习和逐步掌握毛泽东思想，以便能够用毛泽东思想来指导他们反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和反动派的斗争。毛泽东思想照亮了我们前进的道路。毛泽东思想是全世界被压迫人民和一切革命者手中的强大武器。
