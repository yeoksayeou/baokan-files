The Ministry of National Defense held a conference in the afternoon to enthusiastically celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Vice Minister of National Defense Su Yu, and leaders from various departments, branches, and units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including Zhang Xianyao, Zhao Qimin, and Qian Renrong, as well as 1,500 soldiers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, attended the conference. The conference was presided over by Vice Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Wen Yucheng. Nguyen Van Khoa, head of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, and Vu Minh Quan, ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, were invited to attend the conference.

Wen Yucheng delivered a speech at the conference. He, on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense, various departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing garrison, extended the warmest congratulations to the comrades in the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and to all the Vietnamese people who are fighting on the front line against U.S. imperialism. He said, the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are a heroic people's armed force. Over the past seven years, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, they have rapidly grown and strengthened in the flames of the anti-American armed struggle. In the war of resistance against American aggression, the military and people of South Vietnam have closely united, fought together, and with a fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, creatively applied the strategy and tactics of people's war, defeating the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, making it disoriented and desperate, achieving one great victory after another in the war of resistance against American aggression. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Your victories have once again shown that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." Especially recently, the military and people of South Vietnam, with overwhelming force, launched a powerful and fierce Tet Offensive, achieving unprecedented and magnificent victories. The paper tiger of U.S. imperialism has been further exposed and ridiculed in the face of the powerful offensive of the military and people of South Vietnam. The great victory of the Tet Offensive by the military and people of South Vietnam marks that the great war of resistance against American aggression by the Vietnamese people has reached a new height, creating an unprecedentedly good situation for the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people.

Wen Yucheng pointed out that the enemy will not readily accept their defeat. Our great leader Chairman Mao said in a telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho: "All reactionary forces, when they are on the verge of extinction, will inevitably make desperate struggles. They will certainly adopt various military adventurism and political deception to save their extinction. And the revolutionary people, before achieving final victory, will inevitably encounter various difficulties, but these difficulties can be overcome, and no difficulties can stop the advance of the revolutionary people. Persistence is victory." The ferocious U.S. imperialism, in an attempt to save its doomed fate, is trying to intensify military adventurism and collude with Soviet modern revisionism to play the "peace talk" trick. But all these are in vain. The Vietnamese people, who have been tempered by long-term struggles, are not to be frightened or deceived. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, achieving the final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression.

Wen Yucheng expressed that the Chinese people and the Vietnamese people are close brothers and comrades-in-arms, and U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of both countries. After being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will surely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and be the strong rear guard of the brotherly Vietnamese people, firmly supporting your war of resistance against American aggression until the final victory.

Nguyen Van Khoa, at the invitation, delivered a speech amidst warm applause. He detailed the glorious fighting journey of the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which have grown and strengthened under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, as well as the great victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam in the war of resistance against American aggression.

Nguyen Van Khoa said, the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, in the process of building and growing, have always firmly grasped the most important and fundamental principle of political and ideological construction, continuously improving their understanding of fighting for the national interest and for the cause of world revolution. With a spirit of decisive battle and decisive victory, they have launched relentless attacks, fully demonstrating the tradition of the Vietnamese people's army of winning every battle. Today, the boundless power of the people's war in South Vietnam has proven that no matter how many troops U.S. imperialism deploys, no matter what modern weapons and equipment they use, and no matter what form of war they wage, we have enough strength to defeat them.

Nguyen Van Khoa pointed out that although the military and people of South Vietnam have achieved extremely significant victories, and U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have suffered extremely heavy defeats, the U.S. aggressors will not readily give up their policy of invading South Vietnam. Therefore, the struggle of the military and people of South Vietnam is still very arduous. On the road to complete victory, there are still countless thorns and obstacles. As Chairman Ho Chi Minh taught: "The closer to victory, the more difficulties there will be." U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, when they see no hope for the future, before being completely defeated, will surely make desperate struggles. To live up to the praise of the beloved leader Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the three hundred and ten million Vietnamese people, to respond to the call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to express gratitude to the beloved Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their care and encouragement, the military and people of South Vietnam are determined to further strengthen unity, advance with victory, and with an overwhelming force, launch a fierce offensive against the U.S. puppet army, completely shatter the puppet army and puppet government, and strive for the revolutionary cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately unifying the country.

In discussing the fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of the two countries, Nguyen Van Khoa said, the Chinese people regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle, regard South Vietnam as the front line, and regard the great territory of China as the most reliable rear base for Vietnam. The Chinese people are always ready to make the greatest national sacrifices to support the people of South Vietnam in defeating the U.S. aggressors. We believe that the Chinese people have made significant contributions to our victory. We Vietnamese people regard our relationship with the Chinese people as one of sharing weal and woe, comradeship, and brotherhood. The people of South Vietnam and the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have unlimited trust in the Chinese People's Liberation Army and are proud to have such comrades-in-arms. The armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam regard the brotherly Chinese People's Liberation Army as their class brothers. As long as the people of South Vietnam need it, with a word from Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will be ready to fight side by side with us in the same trench against U.S. imperialism at any time.

Nguyen Van Khoa's speech was warmly received. The conference was filled with a spirit of brotherly fighting unity between the peoples and armies of the two countries. After the conference, a documentary film reflecting the heroic deeds of the military and people of South Vietnam in the war of resistance against American aggression was shown.

    阮文广强调南方军民决心乘胜前进彻底打败美帝粉碎傀儡政权
    新华社十四日讯　国防部今天下午举行报告会，热烈庆祝越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年。国防部副部长粟裕，中国人民解放军各总部、各军种、兵种和北京部队负责人张贤约、赵启民、邝任农等，以及陆、海、空三军指战员一千五百多人参加了报告会。报告会由中国人民解放军副总参谋长温玉成主持。越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广和越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾应邀出席了报告会。
    温玉成在会上致词。他代表国防部、中国人民解放军各总部和驻京部队，向战斗在反对美帝国主义最前线的兄弟的越南南方人民解放武装力量的战友们和全体越南人民，最热烈地祝贺越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年。他说，越南南方人民解放武装力量是一支英雄的人民武装力量。七年来，她在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，在反美武装斗争的烈火中迅速成长壮大。在抗美救国战争中，越南南方军民紧密团结，共同对敌，以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏的革命英雄气概，创造性地运用人民战争的战略战术，把全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义打得落花流水，走投无路，取得了抗美救国战争一个又一个的伟大胜利。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”特别是最近，越南南方军民以雷霆万钧之力，向敌人发动了强大凌厉的新春攻势，取得了空前辉煌的巨大战果。美帝国主义这只纸老虎，在越南南方军民的强大攻势面前，更加原形毕露，丑态百出。越南南方军民的新春大捷，标志着越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争已经发展到了一个新的高度，打出了越南人民革命斗争空前大好的形势。
    温玉成指出，敌人绝不会甘心于它们的失败。我们伟大领袖毛主席在给阮友寿主席的贺电中说：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。而革命人民在取得最后胜利之前，也必然会遇到各式各样的困难，但是，这些困难都是可以克服的，任何困难都阻挡不住革命人民的前进。坚持下去就是胜利。”穷凶极恶的美帝国主义，妄图以加紧扩大军事冒险和勾结苏联现代修正主义玩弄“和谈”骗局，来挽救它彻底失败的命运。但是，这统统是徒劳的。久经斗争考验的越南人民是吓不倒、骗不了的。我们坚信，英雄的越南人民一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者及其走狗，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    温玉成表示，中国人民和越南人民是亲密的兄弟和战友，美帝国主义是中越两国人民不共戴天的共同敌人。经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一定遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，誓作兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾，坚决支持你们的抗美救国战争，直到最后胜利。
    阮文广团长应邀在热烈的掌声中作了报告。他详细介绍了越南南方人民解放武装力量，在越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下成长壮大的光荣的战斗历程，以及越南南方军民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的伟大胜利。
    阮文广说，越南南方人民解放武装力量在建设和成长的过程中，一贯紧紧掌握政治思想建设这一最重要的和最根本的原则，不断提高自己为民族利益、为世界革命事业而战斗的认识。他们以决战决胜的精神，坚决进攻，连续进攻，发挥了英雄的越南人民军百战百胜的传统，把美帝国主义及其仆从打得落花流水。今天，越南南方人民战争的无穷威力已经证明，不管美帝国主义投入多少兵力，使用多少现代化的武器和装备，进行什么形式的战争，我们都有足够的力量打败它。
    阮文广指出，尽管越南南方军民取得了极其重大的胜利，美帝国主义及其走狗遭到了极其惨重的失败，但美国侵略者是绝不会甘心放弃其侵略越南南方的政策的。因此，越南南方军民的战斗还十分艰苦。在通往完全胜利的道路上还有无数荆棘险阻。正如胡志明主席教导的那样：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。”美帝国主义及其走狗在感到前途无望的时候，在它们被彻底打垮之前，一定还要作疯狂的垂死挣扎。为了不辜负三千一百万越南人民的敬爱领袖胡志明主席的嘉奖，为了响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的号召，为了感谢敬爱的毛主席、中国人民和中国人民解放军的关怀和鼓舞，越南南方军民决心进一步加强团结，乘胜前进，以排山倒海之势，向美伪军展开凌厉的攻势，彻底粉碎伪军和伪政权，为解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的革命事业而努力奋斗。
    阮文广团长在谈到中越两国人民和两国军队之间的战斗友谊时说，中国人民把越南人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把越南南方看作是前线，把伟大的中国国土看作是越南的最最可靠的后方。中国人民时刻准备付出最大的民族牺牲，支援越南南方人民打败美国侵略者。我们认为，中国人民对我们的胜利作出了重大的贡献。我们越南人民把同中国人民的关系，看作是患难与共、同志加兄弟的关系。越南南方人民和越南南方人民解放武装力量对中国人民解放军无比信任，并且为有这样的战友而感到自豪。越南南方人民解放武装力量把兄弟的中国人民解放军看作是自己的阶级兄弟。只要越南南方人民需要，毛主席一声令下，中国人民就会随时同我们在同一个战壕里抗击美帝国主义。
    阮文广的报告受到了极其热烈的欢迎。报告会始终充满着中越两国人民和两国军队之间兄弟般的战斗团结的气氛。会后放映了反映越南南方军民在抗美救国战争中英勇事迹的纪录影片。（附图片）
