The Chinese Communist Party, armed with the theoretical thought of Marxism-Leninism, has produced a new working style among the Chinese people. The main features of this style are the combination of theory and practice, close ties with the masses, and self-criticism.

The Fourth Session of the Total Staff Department's Active Learners and Users of Mao Zedong Thought Representatives Conference Successfully Concludes

Strengthen Class Struggle Education, Raise Awareness of Line Struggle

Achieve Comprehensive Victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

Great Leader Chairman Mao and His Close Comrade-in-Arms Vice Chairman Lin Received the Delegates During the Conference

The conference was a lively, practical, and effective Mao Zedong Thought study session. It sparked a new wave of unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao, unlimited love for the great thought of Mao Zedong, and unlimited love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The delegates expressed their ironclad resolve to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions.

New China News Agency, February 24th: Under the warm care of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Fourth Session of the Total Staff Department's Active Learners and Users of Mao Zedong Thought Representatives Conference concluded successfully on February 20th. This conference, lasting over thirty days, consistently held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and took Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions as the guideline. It focused on the struggle between the two lines and the two worldviews, summarizing and exchanging the rich experiences of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines over the past two years. The delegates unanimously agreed that in the great march to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is necessary to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously strengthen class struggle education, strive to raise awareness of line struggle, and become resolute proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They will achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and create new achievements for the people.

Great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, as well as Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan, received all the delegates during the conference. This was the greatest care, education, encouragement, and spur for the delegates and all comrades in the Total Staff Department from the great leader Chairman Mao.

This conference was very successful and effective, serving as a lively, practical, and highly effective Mao Zedong Thought study session. It significantly raised the level of these cadres who study, execute, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought. The delegates generally reflected: "It opened up a new style and level," "It was the most closely connected with reality, and the education received was the greatest." The conference will greatly promote the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions in the Total Staff Department, achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and further proletarianize the Total Staff Department.

During the conference, the delegates earnestly studied the great leader Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions, Vice Chairman Lin's series of important instructions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Jiang Qing's series of important instructions, and the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily. With the deepest proletarian feelings, they highly praised the unparalleled wisdom and greatness of the great leader Chairman Mao, the unparalleled power of Mao Zedong Thought, and the outstanding contributions of Vice Chairman Lin. They sparked a new wave of unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao, unlimited love for the great thought of Mao Zedong, unlimited love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unlimited love for Vice Chairman Lin, the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, unlimited love for the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, and unlimited love for the Central Cultural Revolution Group.

The delegates further deeply realized that the great leader Chairman Mao is the most brilliant and outstanding helmsman of the Chinese and world revolution, the most outstanding and great leader of the proletariat and revolutionary people, and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The great thought of Mao Zedong is a typical concentration of the finest human thought and a great development of the finest thought representing the interests of the proletariat and laboring people under new conditions. It is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time, a universal truth applicable everywhere, the strongest and sharpest weapon for the proletariat and laboring people to transform the old world and create a new world, a beacon of human liberation, and the lifeblood of the world's people. Insisting on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle in all fields, achieving the ideological transformation of people, is the foundation of our army's construction, a matter of life and death for the country, the Party, and the regime, and a top priority that determines whether the people gain everything or lose everything. It is the politics of politics, the soul of the soul, and the core of the core. Vice Chairman Lin is a politician, thinker, military strategist, and theoretician of our Party who has been personally cultivated by Chairman Mao and tested over the years. He is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, the most outstanding student, the ideal successor, and our best deputy commander. For decades, he has consistently and wholeheartedly stood on Chairman Mao's side, serving as a shining example of closely following the great leader Chairman Mao, a shining example of profoundly expounding and creatively applying Mao Zedong Thought, a shining example of helping the world proletariat recognize their leader Mao Zedong and passing on Mao Zedong Thought to billions of revolutionary people, and a shining example of defending Chairman Mao's highest leadership position and the supreme authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The delegates, with the strongest class hatred, resolutely criticized and fought against the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. They angrily denounced their heinous crimes of plotting to usurp the military and rebel against the Party with the support of their black backer, the Chinese Khrushchev. They further purged the pernicious influence and poison of these elements, greatly deepened their hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, greatly strengthened their class struggle consciousness, and raised their awareness of line struggle.

The delegates, in connection with the living facts of the struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines, further studied the great leader Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They deeply realized that in a society where classes exist, the most fundamental issue, the issue that affects everything, is the issue of class struggle. The contradiction, opposition, confrontation, and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie become the total source of all our political and social life. The struggle between the lines within the Party is a reflection of the class struggle in society. The essence of the struggle between the two lines is whether to follow the socialist road or the capitalist road. In the socialist period, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is long-term, complex, and sometimes very fierce. We must not think that because we have achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, everything is peaceful. We must not be naive and simplify the complex class struggle. We must see the dying class enemies making desperate counterattacks. We must see that all kinds of social phenomena are phenomena of class struggle. We must recognize that all human relationships are class relationships. We must not look at all issues superficially and in isolation but must connect them with the overall struggle situation. We must observe, analyze, and deal with them from the perspective of class, class contradictions, and class struggle as taught by the great leader Chairman Mao. Otherwise, we will not be able to see the essence through the phenomena, distinguish between enemies and friends, right and wrong, the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, or see the struggle between the two lines in the new situation. We will lose our direction, stand on shaky ground, and be deceived by the class enemy.

The delegates, through their practice in the struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines over the past two years, unanimously agreed that taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, taking "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, continuously strengthening class struggle education, striving to raise awareness of line struggle, and promoting the ideological transformation of people are urgent tasks facing the proletarian revolutionaries. They are fundamental issues that must be resolved to respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The highest class consciousness and awareness of line struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries is to be eternally and unconditionally loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The conference believed that class struggle and the struggle between the two lines permeate all aspects and fields of political and social life. Ultimately, it is a matter of attitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong. Therefore, to raise awareness of class struggle and line struggle, we must first focus on the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We must make loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line the conscious action of every proletarian revolutionary fighter. Every comrade must repeatedly and deeply study the Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought on leaders, parties, classes, and the masses, and Vice Chairman Lin's most profound, thorough, comprehensive, and scientific expositions on the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong. We must continuously raise our understanding of the great leader Chairman Mao, the great thought of Mao Zedong, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and deepen our proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, showing unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao; unlimited love, unwavering belief, and resolute reliance on the great thought of Mao Zedong and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; conscious learning, thorough implementation, active propagation, and brave defense of it.

To strengthen the consciousness of class struggle and line struggle, the most fundamental thing is to never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The conference believed that to raise awareness of class struggle and line struggle, we must arm ourselves with the great leader Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, study Vice Chairman Lin's series of important instructions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and always pay attention to the most important and fundamental issue of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. Chairman Mao taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight desperately against the revolutionary forces precisely to maintain their power." The class struggle and the struggle between the two lines under the dictatorship of the proletariat are, in essence, still a matter of power, that is, the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the proletariat wants to strongly consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. From this fundamental issue, we can observe problems and fundamentally raise class consciousness and awareness of line struggle. Forgetting about power is forgetting about politics and forgetting about the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism. That is being confused, losing one's head without knowing how it happened. The question of who holds our power is a serious one. Is it in the hands of those who support Mao Zedong Thought or those who oppose it? This is a serious problem. The leading cadres are the power, and we must do a good job in organizational revolutionization, ensuring that our leading cadres at all levels are in the hands of those who are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must distinguish between the two types of cadres in power and the two headquarters. We must resolutely support and defend the proletarian cadres in power and the proletarian headquarters, and resolutely oppose and overthrow the capitalist roaders and the bourgeois headquarters. We must resolutely overthrow anarchism and thoroughly purge the pernicious influence of the extremely reactionary social trend of "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything."

The People's Liberation Army is the people's army personally created and led by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. It is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we are close to them; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we fight against them. Our People's Liberation Army will resolutely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, resolutely implement Comrade Jiang Qing's "September 5th" instructions of last year, and fight to the end against anyone who opposes the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary committees. We will give them a crushing blow.

The most fundamental class stance of the proletarian revolutionaries is to firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The conference believed that to raise awareness of class struggle and line struggle, we must fundamentally solve the issue of standing on which side in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The issue of standing on which side is the most important and fundamental issue. It governs everything, commands everything, and is not equal to everything. It is above everything, and everything else is secondary. If we stand on the wrong side, everything is wrong, and everything is wrong. The delegates deeply felt that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the issue of choosing sides is an issue that everyone must solve and will encounter at any time. If we choose the wrong side, we must correct it, and once corrected, it is good to stand over. Every proletarian revolutionary fighter must fully realize that firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most fundamental principle, the most fundamental stance, the highest consciousness, and the purest party spirit. The delegates expressed their determination to fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and die for it in death. They vowed to defend the great leader Chairman Mao, the great thought of Mao Zedong, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the death.

In the struggle between the two lines, daring to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and self-revolution, is the way to become a true proletarian revolutionary.

The conference believed that to raise awareness of class struggle and line struggle, we must take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, spark a revolution in our souls, thoroughly transform our worldview, break down the bourgeois "selfishness" and establish proletarian "public-mindedness." We must overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and enhance proletarian party spirit. At present, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is an important weapon used by the bourgeoisie to fiercely oppose the proletariat. The struggle between party spirit and factionalism is the struggle between the two lines in the new situation. If we have selfishness in our minds, we may become captives of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, even being led by the nose by the class enemy. The delegates said: "All evil comes from selfishness, and all good comes from public-mindedness." "With selfishness, one's heart, eyes, and feet will be biased, deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." "With bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, one cannot listen to the words of Chairman Mao's headquarters, follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment closely, execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, cover up the enemy, and harm the revolution." Everything comes down to breaking with selfishness.

Every proletarian revolutionary fighter must not rest on their laurels but strive to create new achievements, treating themselves as a force for the revolution and at the same time, continuously treating themselves as an object of the revolution. Comrades said that the more fiercely we struggle against selfishness, the closer we follow Chairman Mao; the deeper we struggle against selfishness, the closer we are to Chairman Mao. We must continuously use Mao Zedong Thought to purge the selfishness in our minds, daring to revolutionize ourselves, educate ourselves, and liberate ourselves, continuously promoting our ideological transformation. In the great waves of mass struggle, we must withstand the new tests of revolutionary struggle, firmly establish the dominant position of Mao Zedong Thought, and truly become proletarian revolutionary fighters worthy of the new era of great Mao Zedong Thought.

Actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, is the most fundamental guarantee for winning the struggle between the two lines and achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The conference pointed out that the invincible and great thought of Mao Zedong is our strongest and sharpest weapon for waging the struggle between the two lines. To strengthen class struggle consciousness and raise awareness of line struggle, we must raise the self-awareness of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought by a thousandfold and ten thousandfold, and more broadly and deeply carry out the great mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. We must place the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, especially his latest instructions, in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. We must use the greatest determination, the strongest will, and the main energy to grasp it, never let it go, and grasp it to the end. We must vigorously carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, learning and using in struggle, combining learning with use, and seeing immediate results. We must implement Chairman Mao's works and his latest series of instructions sentence by sentence, word by word, point by point, and fully implement them. The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Promoting Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a great strategic task. The study classes must take "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, bring the issue of the struggle between the two lines, and actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. We must use Chairman Mao's thought to unify our thoughts and use educational methods to solve problems. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the revisionist line in all fields, combine it with various tasks, and carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently. We must politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, the Chinese Khrushchev, and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, thoroughly purge their pernicious influence and poison. We must overthrow the revisionist line and establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; overthrow bourgeois thought and establish Mao Zedong Thought. We must use the living facts of the struggle between the two headquarters and the two lines to educate the masses and continuously raise class consciousness and awareness of line struggle.

The conference emphasized that the Total Staff Department is one of the executive bodies for the great leader Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to command the entire army. In the great struggle to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it bears even heavier and more glorious tasks. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness," do a good job in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work, heighten revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen preparedness, guard our battle positions, and be ready to act at the command. We must be prepared at any time to smash the war provocations of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, prevent the sabotage and disruption of class enemies, defend our great motherland, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. We must more broadly and deeply carry out the mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions point by point and fully, and implement Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions on political work. We must vigorously promote ideological and organizational revolutionization, and seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization. We will turn the Total Staff Department into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Our People's Liberation Army will always stand together with the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, fight together, and win together. We will closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, and closely follow the Central Cultural Revolution Group. We will resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

All the delegates of the conference, with the deepest proletarian feelings of unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao, passed a letter of tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao and a letter of determination to the beloved deputy commander Vice Chairman Lin.

The conference commended advanced collectives and individuals, setting up models for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in struggle. Among them are: the Party branch of a certain office that has consistently held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and been rated as a four-good unit for four consecutive years; the 8341st Unit's support team in Beijing Textile Factory, which has seriously implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on supporting the left and become a red flag for supporting the left nationwide; the "June 26th" unit that has achieved significant victories in fighting against class enemies; a certain unit's first section that has excellently completed preparedness and support tasks; the Party branch of a certain unit's conference office that has diligently served the proletarian headquarters; a certain bureau's supply department that has achieved remarkable results in grasping revolution and promoting work; the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Comrade Liang Zhenyou, who was unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, saved others at the cost of his life, and died a heroic death; and Comrades Wang Shicheng, Zhao Zengfa, Shi Xinren, Liu Shixi, Zhu Lixing, Wang Shunqing, Zhang Fuguang, Feng Hua, Wang Degui, Wei Qingwang, and others who have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, broken with selfishness and established public-mindedness, transformed their worldview, and achieved outstanding results in the "three supports" and "two militaries" work.

This conference was held under the leadership of the Total Staff Department Party Committee.

    以马克思列宁主义的理论思想武装起来的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要的就是理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及自我批评的作风。
    总参第四次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会胜利闭幕
    加强阶级斗争教育提高路线斗争觉悟
    夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席在会议期间接见了全体代表
    大会是一个很生动很实际很有成效的毛泽东思想学习班。会议掀起了无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，无限热爱伟大的毛泽东思想，无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的新高潮。到会代表表达了全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示的钢铁决心。
    新华社二十四日讯　在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席、党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革的亲切关怀下，中国人民解放军总参谋部第四次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会于二月二十日胜利闭幕。这次大会历时三十多天，自始至终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，以毛主席的一系列最新指示为纲，狠抓两条路线、两种世界观的斗争，总结和交流了两年来在两个司令部、两条路线斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的丰富经验。代表们一致认为，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断加强阶级斗争教育，努力提高路线斗争觉悟，做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为人民立新功。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，以及周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、江青、姚文元等同志，在会议期间接见了全体代表。这是伟大领袖毛主席对大会代表和总参谋部全体同志最大的关怀，最大的教育，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。
    这次大会，开得很好，很成功，是一个很生动很实际很有成效的毛泽东思想大学习班，使到会的这些学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想的骨干，水平又大大提高了一步。代表们普遍反映：“开出了新风格，新水平”，“结合实际最紧，受到教育最大”。大会对于总参谋部全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，对于总参谋部的更加无产阶级革命化，具有巨大的促进作用和深远影响。
    会上，代表们认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示，林副主席在无产阶级文化大革命中一系列的重要指示，江青同志的历次重要指示，和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论。大家怀着最深厚的无产阶级感情，大颂特颂伟大领袖毛主席的无比英明、无比伟大和毛泽东思想的无比威力，大颂特颂林副主席的卓越贡献，掀起了无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席、无限热爱伟大的毛泽东思想、无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、无限热爱毛主席的亲密战友林副主席、无限热爱以毛主席为首的党中央、无限热爱中央文革的新高潮。
    代表们进一步深刻认识到，伟大领袖毛主席是中国革命和世界革命最英明最卓越的天才舵手，是无产阶级和革命人民最杰出最伟大的领袖，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。伟大的毛泽东思想，是很典型地集中了人类的优秀思想，并且是在新的条件下大大地发展了代表无产阶级和劳动人民利益的优秀思想，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是无产阶级和劳动人民改造旧世界、创造新世界最强大最锐利的武器，是人类解放的灯塔，是世界人民的命根子。坚持在一切领域中用毛泽东思想挂帅，实现人的思想革命化，这是我军建设之本，是关系到国家的存亡，党的存亡，政权的存亡，是人民得到一切或丧失一切的头等重大问题，是政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心。林副主席是毛主席亲自培养的、我们党久经考验的最卓越的政治家、思想家、军事家、理论家，是毛主席最亲密的战友，最优秀的学生，最理想的接班人，是我们最好的副统帅。他几十年如一日，始终一贯地最忠实最坚决地站在毛主席一边，是紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的光辉典范，是精辟阐明、创造性运用毛泽东思想的光辉典范，是帮助世界无产阶级认识自己的天才领袖毛主席、把毛泽东思想交给亿万革命人民的光辉典范，是捍卫毛主席的最高领袖地位和毛泽东思想最高权威的光辉典范。
    代表们以无比强烈的阶级仇恨，对反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿进行了坚决的批判斗争，愤怒声讨了他们在其黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，大搞篡军反党阴谋活动的滔天罪行，进一步肃清了他们的恶劣影响和流毒。大大地加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的仇恨，大大地增强了阶级斗争观念，提高了路线斗争觉悟。
    代表们联系两个司令部、两条路线斗争的活生生事实，进一步学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大理论，深刻地认识到：在阶级存在的社会领域里面，最基本的问题，影响一切的问题，是阶级斗争的问题。无产阶级和资产阶级这两个阶级的矛盾、对立、对抗、斗争，成为我们全部的政治生活、社会生活的一个总根源。党内路线的斗争是社会阶级斗争的反映。两条路线斗争的本质，是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路的问题。在社会主义时期，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争还是长期的，复杂的，有时甚至是很激烈的。绝不要因为我们在无产阶级文化大革命中已经取得了伟大的胜利，就认为太平无事了。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。一定要看到垂死的阶级敌人在不断进行疯狂反扑。一定要看到各种各样的社会现象，都是阶级斗争的现象。一定要认识到人与人的关系都是阶级的关系。对一切问题，绝不能表面地孤立地去看，必须同整个斗争形势联系起来，用伟大领袖毛主席历来教导我们的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的观点去观察、去分析、去对待。不这样，就不能透过现象看到本质，就分不清敌我，分不清是非，分不清毛主席的革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的界限，分不清无产阶级司令部和资产阶级司令部的界限，也就看不到新形势下的两条路线的斗争，就会迷失方向，站不稳立场，上阶级敌人的当。
　  代表们通过两年来在两个司令部、两条路线斗争中的实践，一致认为，以毛泽东思想挂帅，以“斗私，批修”为纲，不断加强阶级斗争教育，努力提高路线斗争觉悟，搞好人的思想革命化，是摆在无产阶级革命派面前的迫切任务，是响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底必须解决的根本问题。
    无产阶级革命派最高的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，就是永远无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席
    会议认为，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争贯串在政治生活和社会生活的一切领域，一切方面，归根结底，就是对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的态度问题。因此，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，首先必须狠抓对毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度。把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线变成每一个无产阶级革命战士的自觉行动。每一个同志都要反复地深入地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于领袖、政党、阶级、群众的学说，学习林副主席对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想最精辟、最透彻、最全面、最科学的论述。不断提高对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的认识，不断加深对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情。以林副主席为光辉榜样，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚；对伟大的毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无限地热爱她，无比地坚信她，坚定地依靠她，自觉地学习她，彻底地实现她，积极地宣传她，勇敢地捍卫她。
    加强阶级斗争和路线斗争观念，最根本的就是要念念不忘无产阶级专政
    会议认为，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，必须用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大理论武装头脑，学习林副主席在无产阶级文化大革命中一系列的重要指示，时刻注意巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟这个最重要最根本的问题。毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争、两条路线斗争，在本质上，依然是政权问题，就是资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政，无产阶级则要大力巩固无产阶级专政。从这个根本问题出发，去观察问题，才能从根本上提高阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。忘记了政权，就是忘记了政治，忘记了马克思主义的根本观点。那就是糊涂人，脑袋掉了，还不知道怎么掉的。我们的政权究竟掌握在什么人手上，是掌握在拥护毛泽东思想的人手上，还是掌握在反对毛泽东思想的人手上，这是一个严重问题。领导班子就是政权，我们一定要搞好组织革命化，使我们的各级领导班子掌握在无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的人手里。一定要分清两种当权派、两个司令部。对无产阶级当权派，对无产阶级司令部，要坚决拥护、坚决捍卫；对走资派，对资产阶级司令部，要坚决反对，坚决打倒。一定要坚决打倒无政府主义，彻底肃清“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”这种极端反动的社会思潮的流毒。
    中国人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和亲自领导的，是林副主席直接指挥的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石。谁拥护毛主席我们就和他亲；谁反对毛主席我们就和他拚。我们中国人民解放军坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决执行江青同志去年的“九·五”指示，谁反对毛主席为首的党中央，谁反对中央文革，谁反对人民解放军，谁反对革命委员会，我们就和他坚决斗争到底，并给予粉碎性的打击。
    无产阶级革命派最根本的阶级立场，就是坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边
    会议认为，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，必须彻底解决在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中站在哪一边这个根本立场问题。站在哪一边的问题，这是标准的头等重要的问题。它统治一切，统帅一切，不是平等的，它是高于一切的东西，其它都是二位的，下位的。站错了立场，一切都错了，全盘都错了。代表们深刻体会到，在无产阶级文化大革命中，站队问题是人人都要解决、时时都会遇到的问题。如果站队站错了，就坚决改，改了就好，站过来就是了。每一个无产阶级革命战士，必须充分认识到：坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，是最根本的大节，最根本的立场，最高的觉悟，最纯的党性。代表们表示决心做到：生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。誓死保卫伟大领袖毛主席，誓死保卫伟大的毛泽东思想，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓死保卫副统帅林副主席，誓死保卫党中央，誓死保卫中央文革。
    在两条路线斗争中勇于破私立公、自我革命，才能成为真正的无产阶级革命派
    会议认为，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，必须以“老三篇”为座右铭，在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，增强无产阶级的党性。在当前，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是资产阶级疯狂反对无产阶级的一个重要武器，党性与派性的斗争，是新形势下两条路线的斗争。头脑里有了私字，就可能当资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的俘虏，甚至被阶级敌人牵着鼻子走。代表们说：“万恶皆由私字起，千好都从公字来。”“有了私字，就会心偏，眼偏，脚跟偏，偏离毛主席的革命路线。”“有了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，毛主席司令部的话听不进，毛主席的战略部署跟不紧，毛主席的革命路线难执行，掩护敌人，危害革命。”千头万绪就是要破私。
    每一个无产阶级革命战士，都不要吃老本，要立新功，要把自己当作革命的一分力量，同时，又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。同志们说斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧；斗私越深，和毛主席越亲。我们就是要不断地用毛泽东思想专自己头脑里私字的政，勇于自己革自己的命，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，不断地促进自己的思想革命化。在群众斗争的大风大浪里，经受革命斗争的新考验，牢固地树立毛泽东思想的统治地位，真正做一个无愧于伟大毛泽东思想新时代的无产阶级革命战士。
    活学活用毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席最新指示，是胜利进行两条路线斗争、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最根本的保证
    会议指出，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我们进行两条路线斗争最强大最锐利的武器。加强阶级斗争观念，提高路线斗争觉悟，必须一千倍一万倍地提高活学活用毛泽东思想的自觉性，更加广泛更加深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。要把活学活用毛主席著作特别是毛主席的最新指示，切实摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，以最大的决心、最坚强的毅力、最主要的精力来抓，抓住不放，一抓到底。要大力发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论和实际相联系的革命好学风，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，学用结合，立竿见影。对毛主席著作，对毛主席的一系列最新指示，要句句照办，字字照办，条条落实，全面落实。毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。要大力办好毛泽东思想学习班。大办毛泽东思想学习班，是伟大的战略任务。学习班要以“斗私，批修”为纲，带着两条路线斗争的问题，活学活用毛主席一系列最新指示。用毛主席的思想来统一我们的思想，用教育的方法来解决问题。要以毛泽东思想为武器，在各个领域中狠批修正主义路线，结合各项任务，把革命大批判深入地持久地开展下去。把党内最大的走资派中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们的恶劣影响和流毒。大破修正主义路线，大立毛主席革命路线；大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想。用两个司令部、两条路线斗争的活生生事实教育群众，不断提高阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。
    会议强调指出，总参谋部是伟大领袖毛主席、副统帅林副主席和党中央、中央军委、中央文革指挥全军的办事机构之一，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，担负着更加繁重而光荣的任务。我们必须念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。要“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”，做好“三支”“两军”工作，百倍提高革命警惕，加强战备，严守战斗岗位，做到一声令下，立即行动。随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的战争挑衅，严防阶级敌人的捣乱和破坏，保卫伟大的祖国，保卫伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，支援世界各国人民的革命斗争。我们要更加广泛更加深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，切实贯彻林副主席对政治工作的重要指示，大抓狠抓思想革命化和组织革命化，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把总参谋部办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    我们人民解放军永远和广大无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟毛主席为首的党中央，紧跟中央文革，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    大会的全体代表怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱的深厚的无产阶级感情，通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬信和通过了给敬爱的副统帅林副主席的决心书。
