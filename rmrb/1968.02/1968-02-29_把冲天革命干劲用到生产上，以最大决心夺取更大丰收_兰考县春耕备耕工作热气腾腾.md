The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lan K'ao County, Hopei Province, are following the great teachings of Chairman Mao on "grasp revolution, promote production," channeling the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm aroused by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production. They are vigorously promoting production while firmly grasping revolution, and spring ploughing and preparation work is being carried out with great enthusiasm.

After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lan K'ao County has greatly increased, and their spiritual outlook has been completely transformed. With the greatest enthusiasm and the greatest resolve, they are determined to achieve an even greater harvest this year.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lan K'ao County are resolutely carrying out the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" put forward by our great leader Chairman Mao. Whether in the midst of the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution or under the suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, they have always insisted on production during the day and revolution at night. Especially after being liberated from the suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line under the warm concern of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lan K'ao are more than ever full of vigor and high spirits, with increased enthusiasm. They are holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism and fiercely criticizing the reactionary fallacies of China's Khrushchev, such as "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "exploitation is meritorious," and the reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small clique."

Revolutionary criticism has promoted production development. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the four red banner brigades established by Comrade Chiao Yu-lu during his lifetime—Han Village, Ch'in Village, Chao T'ou-lou, and Shuang-yang Tree—are using Mao Tse-tung Thought as their guide. Based on the summary of their work in 1967, they have all drawn up feasible agricultural development plans for this year. Ch'in Village Production Brigade has used its accumulated public funds to buy a "East Is Red" tractor, as well as an oil press, a cotton gin, and sewing machines, etc. At present, they have already started spring ploughing with the tractor and are determined to achieve high-standard electrified irrigation and garden farming for 80 percent of the autumn fields in the entire brigade. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Nan-ma-chuang Production Brigade, armed with Mao Tse-tung Thought, are full of vigor and enthusiasm, going to the fields before dawn. Due to the high spirits and enthusiasm of the members, a task that should take ten days was completed in five and a half days. The Ta-fu-t'ang Production Brigade of Kuei-yang Commune, located on the edge of the old Yellow River course, suffers from waterlogging in low-lying areas and reduced yields in high-lying areas during droughts. To fundamentally change this situation, they are leveling high areas and filling low areas, transforming the land, and aiming to convert the entire brigade's 2,000 mu of high and low-lying land into a large, contiguous block of electrified irrigation plots. With a sense of ownership and a high sense of political responsibility, all the poor and lower-middle peasants voluntarily observe socialist labor discipline, voluntarily go to work, and the attendance rate is over 95 percent, with labor efficiency reaching an unprecedented level. Since last winter, the entire brigade has completed more than 160,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and together with the land leveled last year, there are already more than 1,000 mu.

Recently, the Lan K'ao County Revolutionary Committee held a mobilization rally for county, commune, brigade, and production team cadres at four levels to "grasp revolution, promote production," summarizing the experiences of revolution and production over the past year, and fully deploying the tasks of revolution and production for 1968. They are determined to raise higher the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve double victories in revolution and production this year.

    把冲天革命干劲用到生产上，以最大决心夺取更大丰收
    兰考县春耕备耕工作热气腾腾
    本报讯　河南省兰考县的广大贫下中农，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，把在无产阶级文化大革命运动中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上，狠抓革命，猛促生产，春耕备耕工作搞得热气腾腾。
    经过一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，兰考县广大贫下中农的社会主义觉悟有了很大提高，精神面貌焕然一新。他们以最大的干劲，最大的决心，夺取今年农业更大丰收。
    兰考县广大贫下中农坚决执行我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，不管是在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，或是在资产阶级反动路线的压制下，他们都是坚持白天搞生产，晚上闹革命。特别是在毛主席、党中央的亲切关怀下，兰考贫下中农从资产阶级反动路线的压制下解放出来以后，更是意气风发，斗志昂扬，干劲倍增。他们高举革命大批判的旗帜，狠批猛批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”等反动谬论和“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动路线。
    革命的大批判，推动了生产的发展。焦裕禄同志生前树立的四个红旗队：韩村、秦寨、赵垛楼、双杨树的贫下中农，以毛泽东思想为指针，在总结一九六七年工作的基础上，都订出了今年切实可行的农业发展规划。秦寨大队用自己积累的公积金买了一台“东方红”拖拉机，还买了榨油机、轧花机和缝纫机等。目前，他们已经使用拖拉机开始春耕，他们决心把全大队百分之八十的大秋地实现高标准的电灌园田化。用毛泽东思想武装起来的南马庄大队广大贫下中农社员，意气风发，干劲冲天，天不明就下地。由于社员热情高，干劲大，十天的任务，五天半就完成了。堌阳公社大付堂大队，紧靠黄河故道的边沿，遇水涝凹地受淹，逢干旱凸地减产。为了从根本上改变这种状况，他们铲凸填凹，改造大地，要把全大队二千亩凸凹地，整修为连成一片的大块电灌畦田。全体贫下中农以主人翁的态度和高度的政治责任感，自觉地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，自觉出工，出勤率达百分之九十五以上，劳动效率空前提高。从去冬到现在，全大队已做了十六万多土方，连同去年平整的土地已有一千余亩。
    最近，兰考县革命委员会又召开了县、社、大队、生产队四级干部“抓革命，促生产”誓师动员大会，总结了一年多来革命、生产经验，全面部署了一九六八年革命和生产任务。决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取今年革命、生产双胜利。
