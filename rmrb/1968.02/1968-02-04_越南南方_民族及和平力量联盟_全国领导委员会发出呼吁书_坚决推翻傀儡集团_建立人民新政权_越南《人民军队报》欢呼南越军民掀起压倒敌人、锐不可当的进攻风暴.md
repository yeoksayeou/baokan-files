The National Leadership Committee of the "National and Peace Forces Alliance" in South Vietnam was recently established and issued a call to action on January 31. The call to action outlines the alliance's struggle objectives as follows: First, resolutely overthrow the puppet regime of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, and establish a government that truly represents the people of all strata in South Vietnam. Second, resolutely fight to regain national independence and sovereignty. The United States must stop its unjust war and withdraw all American and puppet troops from South Vietnam. Third, resolutely restore peace: Establish an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral South Vietnam. Fourth, negotiate with the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to jointly realize the above wishes.

The call to action then urges the military and police forces of the Saigon puppet government to stand on the side of the people or hand over their weapons to the revolutionary forces.

The call to action states: We call on those who have gone astray to wake up quickly! Those who show remorse and are willing to make amends will be treated leniently by the revolutionary forces. Those who deliberately oppose the revolution will be severely punished.

We demand that the American and puppet troops stop all military activities and cease interfering in the internal affairs of the South Vietnamese people.

We call on the American people to stand on the side of the South Vietnamese revolution for justice and humanity.

We appeal to the friendly countries of the South Vietnamese people and all organizations and individuals around the world who sympathize with the South Vietnamese people to actively support our just actions.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 3, the Vietnamese "People's Army Newspaper" published an editorial on February 3 stating that in the past four days, the revolution in the South has taken a huge step forward, shaking the mountains and rivers, and shaking the world, opening a new battle situation that is very favorable to our people and unfavorable to the American aggressors and their lackeys.

The editorial states: The prominent feature of the current situation is that the patriotic people of the South have risen up in great numbers and are launching a continuous and fierce attack on the enemy. The entire South is a scene of revolutionary fervor, and a storm of attacks that overwhelm the enemy and are irresistible is sweeping through. While the American puppet group is in a state of panic and confusion, they are still making desperate struggles.

The editorial points out: In the face of a desperate situation, the American aggressors are hurriedly deploying troops in an attempt to reverse the situation. However, in the revolutionary storm of the South, the struggles of the invaders and traitors are merely acts of desperation.

The editorial states: The people of the South are now more resolute than ever in continuously attacking the enemy. Continuous attacks to maintain and expand victories; continuous attacks to expand the battlefront; continuous attacks to develop revolutionary forces; continuous attacks to prevent the enemy from retaking lost positions; continuous attacks to shatter the aggressive ambitions of the American aggressors. The editorial concludes: "Stand up! Stand up everywhere! Attack! Attack continuously! The heroic people of the South will surely win!"

    呼吁书接着号召西贡伪政府所属军警官兵站到人民这一边来，或把他们的武器交给革命力量。
    呼吁书说：我们号召那些误入歧途的人赶快觉醒！那些有悔罪表现并愿将功补过的人将得到革命力量的宽大处理。那些蓄意反对革命的将予严惩。
    我们要求美军和仆从军停止一切军事活动，停止干涉越南南方人民的内部事务。
