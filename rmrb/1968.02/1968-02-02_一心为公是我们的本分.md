Devoting Oneself to the Public Good Is Our Duty

Worker Zhang Haifu, Factory 3528

The Chinese Khrushchev boasts about those "party members who suffer first and enjoy later," claiming that "they are, or eventually are, trusted and respected by us all and the masses, that is to say, they are the most worthy." According to his logic, by "suffering" one can gain a lot of "trust" and "respect," which is supposedly "most worthy." The Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "secret formula" for being a good party member is nothing but a trick used by opportunists, and it is a great insult to Communist Party members!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people." I follow Chairman Mao's teachings and do whatever the Party assigns me to do. I have been a searchlight operator, learned to drive a car, then raised pigs, and now I am a rubber worker. I always take Comrade Zhang Zedong as my example, fighting against the slightest selfish thoughts. Whether it's dirty, hard, or tiring work, whether it's raising pigs or driving a car, it's all for the revolution. I don't consider whether it's "worthy" or not. I am a Communist Party member, and the more difficult the place, the more I should go. Our workshop's Section 5 is a place with high labor intensity and a lot of toxic gases. When the workshop first started, there was an urgent need for people, so I volunteered to go. I have gone down into the vats with a lot of toxic gases to unclog pipes twice, climbed onto the fiery workshop to put out fires twice, been poisoned and unconscious twice, and been hospitalized for emergency treatment twice. All of this is the result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide every action of mine.

I deeply feel that being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, seeking neither fame nor gain, fearing neither hardship nor death, devoting oneself to the public good, everything for the public, a lifetime for the public, and serving the people wholeheartedly, is the duty and the greatest happiness of a Communist Party member and a revolutionary soldier. Let the Chinese Khrushchev's selfish worldview of "devoting oneself to private interests, everything for private interests, a lifetime for private interests is 'most worthy'" go to hell!

    一心为公是我们的本分
    三五二八工厂工人　张海福
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡吹什么“那些吃苦在前，享受在后的党员”，“他们是，或者最后是，为我们大家及群众所信任，所尊敬的，也就是说，他们是最值得的。”照他那一套办，以“吃苦”来捞回一大堆“信任”、“尊敬”，就是“最值得的”。中国赫鲁晓夫的这副“作一个好的党员”的灵丹妙药，完全是投机商人的一套生意经，也是对共产党员的最大污辱！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。我遵循毛主席的教导，在平凡的工作中，党叫干啥就干啥。我当过探照灯手，学过开汽车，后来喂猪，现在是橡胶工人。我处处以张思德同志为榜样，狠斗私字“一闪念”，管它什么脏活、苦活、累活，管它喂猪、开汽车，都是为革命，根本不考虑什么“值得不值得”的问题。我是一个共产党员，越是困难的地方越是要去。我们车间五工段是劳动强度较大、有毒气体较多的地方。开工初期，急需要人，我就主动要求去。我曾两次下到有毒气体较多的浆槽堵管道，爬上烈火冲天的工房救火，两次中毒昏迷，两次住院抢救。这都是活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想指挥我的每一个行动的结果。
    我深深体会到，无限忠于毛主席，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为公，一切为公，一生为公，忠心耿耿为人民服务，这就是共产党员、革命战士的本分，也是最大的幸福。让中国赫鲁晓夫那种一心为私，一切为私，一生为私是“最值得”的利己主义世界观见鬼去吧！
