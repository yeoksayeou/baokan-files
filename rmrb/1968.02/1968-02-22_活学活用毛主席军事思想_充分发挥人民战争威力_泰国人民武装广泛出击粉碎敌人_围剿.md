The Thai people's armed forces, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, have recently achieved a series of brilliant victories by employing flexible and mobile guerrilla tactics, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy.

According to reports, from February 12 to 18, the Thai people's armed forces launched widespread attacks in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions, engaging in seven battles with the enemy and annihilating a batch of reactionary Thai military and police forces.

The activities of the people's armed forces in northern Thailand have recently rapidly developed to Phrae Province. According to news on the 19th, in Ban Khlai village, Chiang Rai Province, the people's armed forces killed one reactionary officer and five soldiers, and wounded eight reactionary soldiers. The people's armed forces also surrounded Huai Sa village and Tambon in Chang Klang County. It was also reported that on the night of the 17th, a small squad of about ten people from the people's armed forces attacked the police in Mueang Fon. A Hmong people's armed force also shot down a puppet government helicopter in the northern region, annihilating seven enemy soldiers. In Mueang Ban Suan village, Chiang Rai Province, the people's armed forces distributed leaflets against the Thanom government and engaged in fierce battles with reactionary military and police forces.

The people's armed forces in northeastern Thailand are also intensifying their activities. They attacked the Thanom puppet government troops in Ban Nakhon village, Ban Na San County, Sa Kaeo Province, and Ban Phon Sawang village, Sa Wan Ding County. They also attacked officials in Ban Mang village, Ban Dong County, Udon Thani Province.

The Thai people's armed forces are studying and applying Chairman Mao's military thought, fully utilizing the superiority of people's war, and smashing the enemy's "extermination" campaigns one after another, continuously expanding their own forces. According to Western news agencies, in the past two months alone, in the northern region of Nan Province, 50 reactionary Thai soldiers have been killed and 100 wounded. The guerrillas in the north previously used old rifles and bows and arrows, but now they have seized modern rifles from the enemy.

Under the victorious development of the Thai people's armed forces, the reactionary regime in Thailand is in great panic. Thai puppet Prime Minister Thanom recently personally went to the north to command the so-called "anti-communist" war and used helicopters, napalm, and other modern weapons to brutally suppress the people. However, brutal suppression cannot stop the development of the people's armed forces. Thanom exclaimed on the 19th: "The threat of the Communist Party is getting bigger and bigger." This actually admits the shameful failure of the "extermination" campaigns.

    活学活用毛主席军事思想　充分发挥人民战争威力
    泰国人民武装广泛出击粉碎敌人“围剿”
    新华社二十一日讯曼谷消息：由泰国共产党领导的泰国人民武装，发挥机动灵活的游击战术，最近又取得了一系列光辉的胜利，给予敌人以沉重的打击。
    据报道，在二月十二日到十八日的一周内，泰国人民武装在北部、东北部和南部等地区广泛出击，同敌人战斗七次，分别歼灭一批泰国反动军警。
    泰国北部人民武装的活动最近迅速发展到程逸府。据十九日的消息，在北部青莱府的巴克累村，人民武装打死反动军官一人和士兵五人，打伤反动士兵八人。人民武装还包围了昌勘县的辉沙村和坦博永。另据报道，十七日夜间，一支约十人的人民武装小分队袭击发他县万汇隆的警察。一支苗族人民武装还在北部地区击落傀儡政府直升飞机一架，歼灭敌军七人。在青莱府清盛县万巴顺村，人民武装散发反对他侬集团的传单，并同反动军警开展了激战。
    泰国东北部的人民武装也在加紧活动。他们袭击了沙空那空府的巴那尼空县的古南寨村和沙旺丹丁县的波尼沙旺村的他侬傀儡集团军队，还袭击乌隆府班东县班芒村官员。
    泰国人民武装活学活用毛主席的军事思想，充分发挥人民战争的优越性，粉碎了敌人一次又一次的“围剿”，在战斗中不断壮大自己的队伍。据西方通讯社透露，仅在北部难府一地，在过去两个月里，泰国反动军队就被击毙了五十人，被打伤一百人。北部的游击队过去使用的是陈旧的步枪和弓箭，而现在已经从敌人手中夺到了新式的步枪。
    在泰国人民武装胜利发展的形势下，泰国反动当局感到十分恐慌。泰国傀儡总理他侬最近曾亲自跑到北部指挥所谓“剿共”战争，并且使用直升飞机、凝固汽油弹等现代化武器对人民进行疯狂的镇压。但是，残酷的镇压根本无法阻止人民武装的发展。他侬在十九日惊呼：“共产党的威胁越来越大了。”这实际上是招认了“围剿”的可耻的失败。
