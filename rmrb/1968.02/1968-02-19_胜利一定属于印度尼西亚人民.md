Victory Belongs to the Indonesian People

Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the fundamental issue of the proletarian revolution is to seize power through armed struggle and establish proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao's teachings on the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism, that is, "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize power through armed struggle, and to solve problems through war," have universal significance.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique has betrayed proletarian internationalism and peddled the revisionist line of "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful transition." They attempt to obstruct the revolutionary struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world, especially those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, against colonialism and imperialism led by U.S. imperialism.

However, the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly seeing the bankruptcy of the Soviet revisionist clique's "peaceful road" fallacy.

The revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, through their revolutionary struggle practice, have come to understand that the path of armed seizure of power, as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong—that is, under the leadership of the proletarian party, mobilizing the peasant masses in the countryside to wage guerrilla warfare, carrying out land revolution, establishing rural base areas, and surrounding the cities from the countryside to ultimately seize the cities—is the only correct path to liberation for the revolutionary peoples.

Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian revolutionary people, after learning from the severe setbacks and temporary retreats, are now advancing along the revolutionary path pointed out by the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party approved a report agreeing with the line of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union without criticism, and adopted the line of "reaching socialism through the parliamentary road and peaceful means" as the line of the Indonesian Communist Party. From this time on, modern revisionism began to infiltrate the party. It was this revisionist line that left the Indonesian people and Indonesian communists unprepared in the face of the armed counter-revolutionary white terror of 1965, resulting in the massacre of hundreds of thousands of the finest sons and daughters of the Indonesian people. This revisionist line and the "peaceful road" completely contradict Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist proposition that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and "without an army of the people, there can be no people's everything." The policies of the Indonesian Communist Party leadership in the more than ten years before 1965, especially the policy of the united front established with Sukarno, were essentially policies of class cooperation. This policy contradicts Chairman Mao's teachings on the united front, that is: "The united front is a united front for carrying out armed struggle. The party organization is the brave warrior who wields the two weapons of the united front and armed struggle to charge into the enemy's ranks."

Under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people are now rising again and taking the path of armed struggle. Currently, the revolutionary united front established in Indonesia is first and foremost the alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party for armed struggle.

However, just as the Indonesian revolutionaries are wiping the blood from their bodies, reorganizing their forces, and raising the great banner of armed struggle and the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the Soviet revisionist clique is doing its utmost to sabotage and create chaos within the ranks of the Indonesian communists. It is clear that the Soviet revisionist traitors are trying to obstruct the Indonesian revolutionary people from taking the path of people's war, establishing rural base areas, and surrounding the cities from the countryside, as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong.

The Soviet revisionist clique's activities to split the Indonesian Communist Party are a betrayal of the proletarian internationalism upheld by the great Lenin and Stalin.

Since the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique came to power in Indonesia, the Soviet revisionist clique has been full of praise for this fascist military regime, describing it as a regime that implements an "independent policy against imperialism and colonialism"; describing Nasution, the fascist leader with blood on his hands from the Indonesian communists and Indonesian people, as an "anti-imperialist national leader" and a "revolutionary leader" of Indonesia. They have been continuously providing "economic and technical aid" to the fascist military regime and continuing to supply them with weapons.

For the Indonesian Communist Party and Marxist-Leninists around the world, it is absolutely necessary to oppose modern revisionism. The self-criticism of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau in September 1966 pointed out, "The experience and lessons of the Indonesian Communist Party are: Modern revisionism is the greatest danger in the international communist movement and is also the greatest danger to the Indonesian Communist Party. Therefore, the danger of modern revisionism must not be overlooked, and it must be fought against mercilessly."

Currently, the center of world revolution has shifted to China. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, China, as a bastion of world revolution, is increasingly developing and consolidating. This is highly beneficial to the international communist movement, especially to the communists currently engaged in armed struggle.

Chairman Mao is the most reliable successor of the great teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Marx and Engels established the theoretical foundations of scientific socialism during the period of capitalist development. When capitalism had developed into the stage of imperialism, Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism into Leninism, solving a series of problems related to proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, as well as the problem of achieving victory for socialism in one country. Leninism is Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. In the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory, Chairman Mao has comprehensively summarized the experiences and lessons of the international communist movement, brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao has solved a series of problems related to contemporary proletarian revolution, solving the theoretical and practical problems of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship to prevent capitalist restoration and further consolidate proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. This is an important sign that Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new and highest stage.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of Chinese people have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible ideological weapon. This is unprecedented in the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and in the history of the international workers' movement. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes the most powerful force to smash imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time and the greatest and most brilliant leader of the international proletariat.

Mao Zedong Thought has now become the ideological foundation of the international communist movement. Just as the great teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the Indonesian people and the people of the world. Striving to learn, loyally and creatively applying, bravely defending, and enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought is not only the glorious task of the Chinese people but also the glorious task of the revolutionary people of the world, especially the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people.

In contemporary times, the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone and dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution, true Marxist-Leninists and counter-revolutionary revisionists.

The revolutionary peoples and Marxist-Leninists of the world love the great leader Chairman Mao. Therefore, against Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk, the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people, the revolutionary peoples and Marxist-Leninists of all countries in the world must politically, ideologically, and theoretically expose them, knock them down to the ground, and make sure they never rise again.

In the face of heavy blows suffered by the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people, the great leader Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people, the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people, the revolutionary peoples and Marxist-Leninists of the world have given great support and aid to the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people. The help of the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world, especially the great Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, to the struggle of the Indonesian people, as well as their firm stance against the common enemies of the world's revolutionary peoples—the imperialism led by the United States, the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and the reactionaries of all countries—has greatly encouraged the Indonesian communists and Indonesian people to more resolutely fight and thoroughly smash the Suharto-Nasution fascist military dictatorship.

The primary reason for the setbacks suffered by the Indonesian revolution is that the Indonesian Communist Party has not adequately grasped Mao Zedong Thought. However, as pointed out in the statement issued by the Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau on May 23, 1967, titled "Hoist High the Banner of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Advance Along the Revolutionary Road!," "The Indonesian Marxist-Leninists unhesitatingly accept Mao Zedong Thought, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and are determined to learn Mao Zedong Thought and use it as a powerful weapon in the Indonesian liberation struggle; the path of the Indonesian liberation struggle inevitably must follow the path of people's war as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong."

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime has massacred and imprisoned tens of thousands of Indonesian communists and Indonesian revolutionary people. However, the Indonesian revolutionary people are indomitable, the flames of revolution are inexhaustible, and the Indonesian communists and Indonesian revolutionary people are unconquerable. They rise from the ground, wipe the blood from their bodies, bury their comrades' remains, and continue to fight. In various parts of Indonesia, the flames of the Indonesian people's struggle are burning more fiercely. Darkness is about to pass, and victory will surely belong to the Indonesian people!

    胜利一定属于印度尼西亚人民
    印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局委员、印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团团长　尤素福·阿吉托罗普
    （一）
    马克思列宁主义教导我们，无产阶级革命的根本问题是通过武装斗争夺取政权，并建立无产阶级专政。
    毛主席关于马克思列宁主义的革命原则的教导，即“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”是具有普遍意义的。
    苏修统治集团背叛无产阶级国际主义，大肆贩卖“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”、“和平过渡”的修正主义路线。他们妄图阻挡世界革命人民，首先是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对以美帝国主义为首的殖民主义和帝国主义的革命斗争的蓬勃发展。
    但是，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲革命人民越来越清楚地看到苏修集团的“和平道路”谬论的破产。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲革命人民通过自己的革命斗争实践，懂得了毛泽东同志指出的武装夺取政权的道路，即在无产阶级政党的领导下，在农村中发动农民群众进行游击战争，开展土地革命，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路，是革命人民求得解放的唯一正确的道路。
    在印度尼西亚共产党领导下的印度尼西亚革命人民，在吸取严重的挫折和暂时的后退的教训以后，现在正在按照伟大领袖毛泽东同志指出的革命道路前进。
    印度尼西亚共产党第五届中央委员会第四次全体会议，不加批判地通过了同意苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的路线的报告，并把“通过议会道路、以和平方式达到社会主义”的路线作为印度尼西亚共产党的路线。从这个时候起，现代修正主义就开始渗入党内。正是这条修正主义路线，使印度尼西亚人民和印度尼西亚共产党人在一九六五年的武装反革命的白色恐怖面前处于毫无准备的状态，以致几十万印度尼西亚人民最优秀的儿女遭到屠杀。这条修正主义路线和“和平道路”完全违背马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，特别是违背毛泽东同志关于“枪杆子里面出政权”、“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的马克思列宁主义的论断。印度尼西亚共产党领导在一九六五年以前的十多年间所执行的统一战线政策，特别是同苏加诺建立的统一战线的政策，实质上是阶级合作政策。这种政策是违背毛主席关于统一战线的教导的，即：“统一战线，是实行武装斗争的统一战线。而党的组织，则是掌握统一战线和武装斗争这两个武器以实行对敌冲锋陷阵的英勇战士。”
    印度尼西亚人民在印度尼西亚共产党领导下，现在开始重新奋起，并且走上了武装斗争的道路。目前，在印度尼西亚建立的革命的统一战线，首先就是建立印度尼西亚共产党领导下的武装斗争的工农联盟。
    但是，正当印度尼西亚革命者揩干自己身上的血迹，重新组织自己的队伍，高举武装斗争的伟大旗帜，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的时候，苏修集团竭力进行破坏，以图在印度尼西亚共产党人的队伍中制造混乱。十分明显，苏修叛徒们力图阻挡印度尼西亚革命人民在印度尼西亚共产党领导下，走上毛泽东同志指出的战无不胜的人民战争、建立农村根据地、农村包围城市的革命道路。
    苏修集团进行的分裂印度尼西亚共产党的活动，是对伟大的列宁和斯大林所坚持的无产阶级国际主义的背叛。
    自苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团在印度尼西亚掌权以来，苏修集团对这个法西斯军人政权备加赞扬，把它说成是执行“反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的独立政策”的政权；把双手沾满印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚人民鲜血的法西斯头目纳苏蒂安称为“反帝的民族领袖”和印度尼西亚的“革命领袖”。他们不断地给法西斯军人政权“经济和技术援助”，而且还继续不断运武器给他们。
    对印度尼西亚共产党和全世界的马克思列宁主义者来说，反对现代修正主义是绝对必要的。一九六六年九月印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局的《自我批评》指出，“印度尼西亚共产党的经验教训是：现代修正主义是国际共产主义运动中最大的危险，也是印度尼西亚共产党的最大的危险”，“因此绝不可忽视现代修正主义的危险，必须对它进行毫不留情的斗争。”
    （二）
    目前，世界革命中心已转移到中国。在毛主席的领导下，作为世界革命堡垒的中国日益发展和巩固。这一点十分有利于世界共产主义运动，特别是十分有利于目前正在进行武装斗争的共产党人。
    毛主席是伟大导师马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的最可靠的继承人。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛主席，成功地解决了他们各个时代无产阶级革命的一系列理论问题。在资本主义发展时期，马克思和恩格斯制定了科学社会主义的理论基础。当资本主义已经发展到帝国主义阶段时，列宁和斯大林把马克思主义发展到列宁主义阶段，解决了无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政一系列的问题，以及解决了社会主义在一个国家取得胜利的问题。列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。在帝国主义正在走向全面崩溃和社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，毛主席全面总结了国际共产主义运动的经验教训，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到了一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想阶段。毛主席解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列问题，解决了在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命，以防止资本主义复辟和进一步巩固无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题。毛主席亲自发动和领导了史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命。这是毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到一个最高的崭新的阶段的一个重要标志。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东思想的大学校。通过无产阶级文化大革命，亿万中国人民掌握毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的思想武器。这是中国人民革命斗争史上，也是国际工人运动史上空前未有的。毛泽东思想一旦被人民群众所掌握，就变成了粉碎帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最强大的力量。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者和国际无产阶级最天才的伟大导师。
    毛泽东思想现在已成为国际共产主义运动的思想基础。正如伟大导师马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林一样，毛主席不但是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民的伟大领袖。努力学习、忠实地创造性地活学活用、勇敢捍卫和热情宣传毛泽东思想，不但是中国人民的光荣任务，而且也是全世界革命人民，特别是印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民的光荣任务。
    在当代，对待毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度，是区别革命和反革命、真革命和假革命、真马克思列宁主义者和反革命修正主义者的试金石和分水岭。
    全世界革命人民和马克思列宁主义者，热爱伟大领袖毛主席。因此，对反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想的中国赫鲁晓夫之流，印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚人民，全世界各国革命人民和马克思列宁主义者，都必须从政治上、思想上、理论上加以揭露，把他们打翻在地，使他们永世不得翻身。
    （三）
    在印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民遭受着沉重打击的情况下，伟大领袖毛主席、中国共产党和中国人民，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，全世界的革命人民和马克思列宁主义者，对印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民给了极大的支持和援助。全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，特别是伟大的中国共产党和中国人民，对于印度尼西亚人民斗争的帮助，以及反对世界革命人民的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义以及各国反动派的坚定立场，极大地鼓舞着印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚人民更坚决地进行斗争，彻底粉碎苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人独裁政权。
    印度尼西亚革命遭到挫折的首要原因，是因为印度尼西亚共产党没有很好地掌握毛泽东思想。但是，正如印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局一九六七年五月二十三日发表的题为《高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的旗帜，沿着革命的道路继续前进！》的声明中所指出的，“印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者毫不犹豫地接受成为当代马克思列宁主义顶峰的毛泽东思想，下定决心学习毛泽东思想，并在印度尼西亚解放斗争中作为强大的武器加以运用；印度尼西亚解放斗争的道路，不可避免地必须走如毛泽东同志所指出的人民战争的道路。”
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权屠杀和监禁了几十万印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚革命人民。但是，印度尼西亚革命人民是杀不绝的，革命的烈火是扑灭不了的，印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚革命人民是征服不了的。他们从地下爬起来，揩干身上的血迹，掩埋好同志们的尸首，又继续战斗了。在印度尼西亚各地，印度尼西亚人民斗争的烽火已越烧越旺。黑暗即将过去，胜利一定属于印度尼西亚人民！
