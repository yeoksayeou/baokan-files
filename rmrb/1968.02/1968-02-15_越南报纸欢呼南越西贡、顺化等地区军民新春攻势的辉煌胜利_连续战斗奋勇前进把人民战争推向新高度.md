Hanoi, February 14 - The Vietnamese newspapers "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" both published editorials on February 14, enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant victories achieved by the military and civilians in the Saigon-Cho Lon region during the Tet Offensive.

The editorial in "People's Daily" stated: The military and civilians in the Saigon-Cho Lon region have delivered a thunderous blow to the enemy within the stronghold of the U.S.-puppet regime and have set a shining example of urban warfare by seizing control from the enemy.

The editorial said: The military and civilians in the Saigon-Cho Lon region, together with all the military and civilians in South Vietnam, have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys both militarily and politically. The enemy has suffered its heaviest defeat to date. The weakness of the U.S.-puppet masters has been laid bare before the world.

The editorial said: The indomitable military and civilians in the Saigon-Cho Lon region are continuing their battles and advancing bravely.

The editorial in "People's Army Daily" said: The brilliant achievements of the military and civilians in the Saigon-Cho Lon region vividly demonstrate that the people's war in the cities of South Vietnam has reached a high level.

The editorial pointed out: The military and civilians in the Saigon-Cho Lon region still face a long and arduous struggle before they can achieve complete victory. Although the U.S. aggressors have suffered heavy losses, they remain obstinate. After suffering heavy defeats, they will continue to resist desperately and resort to even more brutal tactics.

The editorial said: The military and civilians in the Saigon-Cho Lon region, while continuing to attack the enemy, will consolidate their victories and expand their forces, and will surely smash all enemy plots and achieve greater victories.

Hanoi, February 13 - The Vietnamese newspapers "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" both published editorials on February 13, enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant achievements of the military and civilians in the Thua Thien-Hue region during the Tet Offensive.

The editorial in "People's Daily" said: The recent battles in the Thua Thien-Hue region have been a heroic anthem of attack and uprising.

The editorial pointed out: While the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the Thua Thien-Hue region launched fierce attacks on the enemy, the people in the villages and cities rose up en masse to seize control, pushing the people's revolutionary struggle to a new stage.

The editorial said: The military and civilians in Hue City, undeterred by the bombs of the U.S.-puppet regime, have thwarted all enemy counterattacks and shown extraordinary courage.

The editorial in "People's Army Daily" said: In the ten days of revolutionary storm, the military and civilians in the Thua Thien-Hue region have achieved remarkable feats in annihilating the enemy's fighting strength and developing their own forces. They have not only attacked the enemy's strongholds but also struck at the enemy's reinforcements and supply lines, destroying the enemy's weapons; they have not only eliminated diehard bandits and smashed the enemy's chains of control, dissolving the enemy's forces, but also built and expanded the ranks of various revolutionary organizations among the masses.

The editorial pointed out: The indomitable military and civilians in the Thua Thien-Hue region still face a long and arduous battle. This means: Continuously attacking the enemy, seizing even greater victories, smashing all the enemy's desperate struggles and counterattack plots, and steadily and rapidly strengthening their forces to expand their victories.

The editorial concluded: With the close cooperation of all battlefields in the South and the encouragement and support of the entire nation, the Thua Thien-Hue region, which holds the initiative, will surely achieve even greater feats and, together with the military and civilians of the entire nation, will ultimately defeat the U.S. aggressors.
