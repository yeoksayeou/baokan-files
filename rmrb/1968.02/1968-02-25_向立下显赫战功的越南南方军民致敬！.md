	Salute to the Heroic Vietnamese South Military and Civilians!
	The Eighth Company of Nanjing Road

	"In the frost of a thousand trees, the red flowers bloom brilliantly, the heavenly soldiers' anger pierces the heavens."

	As we joyously celebrate the great victories of the Vietnamese South military and civilians in the New Year, another resounding song of victory echoes from the battlefield of the Vietnamese South's anti-American national salvation war. The Vietnamese South People's Liberation Armed Forces, building on their successes, have launched a second powerful offensive. Riding the east wind and waving red flags, they have struck with the force of a thousand mountains and the power of a thousand thunderbolts, delivering another heavy blow to the American aggressors and their lackeys, who are still reeling from their previous defeats. This new glorious achievement fills us with admiration. The Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers hereby pay the highest combat salute to the heroic Vietnamese South military and civilians who have achieved such great feats.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." This great truth has been fully proven once again in the brilliant victories of the Vietnamese South military and civilians in their consecutive battles since the New Year.

	The great victories of the Vietnamese South military and civilians have once again proven that the theory of people's war is a universal truth applicable everywhere, and is the most effective weapon to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys. All oppressed peoples and nations around the world can definitely defeat imperialism led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries through people's war.

	The brilliant achievements of the Vietnamese South military and civilians since the New Year have opened up a new phase in the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war and marked a new chapter in the history of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle. The Vietnamese South military and civilians have creatively applied the strategies and tactics of people's war, closely coordinating the people's army with the broadest masses of the people, striking the American imperialists into a state of panic and disarray. At present, the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war is no longer a question of whether it will be victorious or not, nor is it a question of minor victories or major victories. It is a definite victory, and it has already achieved unprecedented great victories.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses of the people." From the series of victory reports coming from Vietnamese South, we once again deeply feel that the true iron wall is the thousands and tens of thousands of people who genuinely support the revolution. The Vietnamese South military and civilians have enthusiastically responded to the great call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with everyone striving to be a hero in killing the enemy and everyone striving to be a model in defending the country. Men, women, old, and young all join in the effort, building an iron wall and setting up a net of heaven and earth, everywhere is the front line of the anti-American national salvation war. The Vietnamese South people, with the momentum of "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat," have given a resounding slap in the face to the revisionist traitors of the Soviet Union who are kneeling at the feet of American imperialism and desperately opposing the people's war.

	The New Year's great victories of the Vietnamese South military and civilians, and the remarkable achievements of their second powerful offensive, vividly prove: "The decisive factor in the outcome of a war is people, not things." They have displayed the spirit of daring to fight bravely, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, and engaging in continuous combat; the spirit of despising all enemies, overwhelming all enemies, and advancing fearlessly; and the heroic spirit of daring to engage in close combat. They have fought the American aggressors into a state of wailing and panic. The heroic combat of the Vietnamese South military and civilians fully demonstrates the profound judgment of "bravery and skill." "Bravery" is politics, it is the spiritual factor, it is the people's courage and fearlessness of sacrifice. With this, the greatest power can be unleashed, and the greatest combat effectiveness can be achieved.

	Chairman Mao said: "The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of the people who are striving for liberation, this is our internationalist duty." The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the great people's army created and personally led by the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. It is a great army armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. The People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is more revolutionary and more combat-ready. We understand that the victories achieved by the Vietnamese people on the anti-American battlefield are a great support to the Chinese people; the Chinese people's thorough implementation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also a great support to the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries and the Vietnamese people. We will definitely turn the inspiration from the new victories of the Vietnamese South military and civilians in their anti-American national salvation war since the New Year into boundless revolutionary strength. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasp the revolution, promote preparedness for war, and be a firm rear guard for our Vietnamese brothers. "With Chairman Mao's wave, we march forward." Once the Vietnamese people need us, we will fight wherever Chairman Mao points, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people in carrying out the anti-American national salvation war to the end, until they achieve complete and thorough victory.

    向立下显赫战功的越南南方军民致敬！
    南京路上好八连
    “万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。”
    在我们纵情欢呼越南南方军民新春大捷的喜庆日子里，从越南南方抗美救国战争的疆场上，又传来一曲响彻云霄的胜利凯歌。越南南方人民解放武装力量再接再厉，发动了第二次强大攻势。他们乘东风，展红旗，以排山倒海之势、雷霆万钧之力，给惊魂未定的美国侵略者及其走狗又一次沉重的打击。这一新的辉煌战绩，使我们感到敬佩。我们中国人民解放军指战员谨向立下赫赫战功的越南南方军民，致以最崇高的战斗敬礼。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”这一伟大的真理，在越南南方军民新春以来连战连捷的光辉胜利中，又一次得到了充分的证明。
    越南南方军民的伟大胜利，再次证明人民战争的理论是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，完全可以用人民战争打败以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派。
    越南南方军民新春以来的辉煌战绩，打开了越南人民抗美救国战争的新局面，揭开了越南人民革命斗争史上的新篇章。越南南方军民创造性地运用人民战争的战略战术，把人民军队和最广大的群众紧密地配合起来，打得美帝国主义惊慌失措，狼狈不堪。当前，越南人民的抗美救国战争，已经不是能不能胜利的问题，也不是小胜大胜的问题，而是确定无疑地要胜利，并且已经取得了空前伟大的胜利。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”我们从越南南方传来的一个个捷报中，再一次深刻地体会到，真正的铜墙铁壁是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的人民群众。越南南方军民热烈响应胡志明主席和越南南方民族解放阵线的伟大号召，人人争当杀敌英雄，个个争做卫国模范，男女老幼齐努力，筑成了钢铁长城，布下了天罗地网，到处都是抗美救国战争的前沿阵地。越南南方人民以“横扫千军如卷席”的磅礴气势，给了跪在美帝脚下、拚命反对人民战争的苏修叛徒集团一记最响亮的耳光。
    越南南方军民的新春大捷，和再次发动强大攻势所取得的显赫战果，还生动地证明：战争胜负“决定的因素是人不是物”。他们发扬了勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风；发扬了藐视一切敌人，压倒一切敌人，一往无前的大无畏精神；发扬了猛打猛冲，敢于刺刀见红的英雄气概，打得美国侵略者鬼哭狼嚎，丧魂失魄。越南南方军民的英勇战斗充分显示了“胆大艺高”这一深刻的论断。“胆”，就是政治，就是精神因素，就是人的勇敢和不怕牺牲。有了这一条，就能发挥最大的威力，就有了最大的战斗力。
    毛主席说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们中国人民解放军，是全世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席亲手缔造和亲自领导、林副主席直接指挥的伟大的人民军队，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大军队。人民解放军经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，更加革命化和更加战斗化。我们懂得，越南人民在抗美战场上取得的胜利，是对中国人民的重大支援；中国人民把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，也是对各国革命人民和越南人民革命斗争的重大支援。我们坚决把越南南方军民新春以来抗美救国战争新胜利所给我们的鼓舞，化为无穷的革命力量，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，抓革命，促战备，誓作兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾。“毛主席挥手我前进”，一旦越南人民需要，毛主席指到哪里，我们就战斗到哪里，坚决支援越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底，直到取得完全、彻底的胜利。
