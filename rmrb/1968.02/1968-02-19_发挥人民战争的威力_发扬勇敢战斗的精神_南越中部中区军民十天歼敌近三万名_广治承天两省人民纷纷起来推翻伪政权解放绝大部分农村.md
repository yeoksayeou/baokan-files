The people's liberation armed forces and civilians in the central region of South Vietnam have, in the course of ten days, annihilated nearly 30,000 enemy troops. The people of the provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien have risen up in large numbers to overthrow the puppet regime and liberate most of the rural areas.

	Hanoi, February 18 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the Central Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the Central Region of South Vietnam recently issued its second special communiqué. The communiqué said that the people's liberation armed forces in the Central Region of South Vietnam, carrying forward the spirit of brave combat and continuous fighting, have, after ten days of heroic struggle, achieved the glorious feat of annihilating nearly 30,000 enemy troops.

	The communiqué said: From the early hours of January 30 to February 8, the people's liberation armed forces and the people of the Central Region launched fierce attacks on ten provincial capitals and cities, twenty-seven county towns and cities occupied by the enemy, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 30,000 enemy troops (including one-quarter American aggressors and South Korean mercenaries), demoralizing over 50,000 enemy troops; completely annihilating and severely damaging one field command, two army commands, three division commands, nine regiment commands, nine infantry battalions, two armored battalions, thirty-eight companies, and other units; seizing six provincial puppet government offices, four puppet police stations, four radio stations; destroying six enemy prisons and rescuing 4,000 compatriots imprisoned by the enemy; attacking nineteen airfields, thirty-five artillery positions, fourteen parking lots, fifteen important logistics bases, causing enormous damage to the enemy's technical equipment and war tools; destroying and damaging over 800 enemy aircraft of various types, over 150 cannons, over 1,000 military vehicles, eight missile launchers; damaging a ship with a load capacity of 8,000 tons; blowing up tens of thousands of tons of ammunition, burning hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline; cutting off major highways such as the first, fourteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first, controlling the strategic points of various transportation routes, and blowing up fifty large and small bridges.

	The communiqué said: In coordination with the attacks by the people's liberation armed forces, the broad masses of urban and rural areas have risen up to overthrow the puppet regime and seize the right to rule. The resolute people of Da Nang, together with the revolutionary armed forces, launched a fierce assault and captured the command of the puppet army's First Division, attacking and destroying the military and political headquarters of the U.S. and puppet forces.

	The broad masses of people in the cities of Hue, Tam Ky, Quang Ngai, Qui Nhon, Ban Me Thuot, Nha Trang, and other towns have also risen up to capture thugs, shatter the enemy's shackles of rule, and assist the people's liberation armed forces in annihilating the enemy.

	The people in the rural areas occupied by the enemy have closely cooperated with their urban compatriots, rising up together, armed with sticks and spears, to capture thugs and puppet military and civilian guards, destroy enemy strongholds and outposts, and seize enemy weapons.

	The communiqué said that through resolute struggle against the enemy, the masses have established revolutionary governments.

	The communiqué said: Under the fierce offensive of the people's liberation armed forces and the broad masses, the puppet army and puppet government institutions are in chaos and rapidly collapsing. According to incomplete statistics, over 50,000 puppet soldiers have deserted. Many puppet army units have collectively defected to join the people in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

	The communiqué said: The great and comprehensive victories achieved by the military and civilian population of the Central Region have created the conditions for the military and civilian population of the Central Region to achieve even more glorious and comprehensive new victories in the future, together with the military and civilian population of the South and the entire country, to completely defeat the American aggressors.

	The communiqué emphasized that the situation is very favorable to us, but the battle is still arduous and fierce. The enemy, in its desperation, will inevitably resort to all kinds of brutal and savage means in its dying struggle.

	The communiqué finally called on the people's liberation armed forces and the people of the Central Region to fully mobilize the invincible power of people's war, firmly grasp the initiative on the battlefield, continuously attack the enemy, and foil all enemy counterattacks. Together with the military and civilian population of the South and the entire country, they will achieve even greater and more glorious victories and ultimately win the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

	Hanoi, February 18 (Xinhua) - While the people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive against the U.S. and puppet forces, the people of the provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien in South Vietnam have risen up in large numbers to overthrow the enemy's rule. Currently, most of the rural areas in these two provinces have been liberated.

	According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency: In the past ten days since the Lunar New Year, the people in the rural areas surrounding the enemy's military bases in Quang Tri Province have risen up to overthrow the puppet government's ruling institutions. The areas that have been liberated include Chau Thon, Chau Duc, Chau Ngai, Chau Thanh, Hai San, Hai Son, Hai Thu, and Cam Lu. The people have also taken control of many sections of Highway 1 and other roads within the province, surrounding the enemy strongholds of Duy Xuyen, Ben Het, and Con Co.

	In Thua Thien Province, the people have risen up to fight, capturing and forcing the enemy to withdraw from more than ten strongholds, including Phu Lai, De Chuong, and Thanh Thuan. They have also surrounded many county towns, including Quang Dien, Phong Dien, Huong Tra, Phu Vang, and Huong Thuy.

	In the suburbs of Hue City, the people have annihilated and demoralized 169 platoons of puppet civilian guards, shattering the entire enemy "civilian guard" system, completely annihilating the "pacification" thugs who have committed countless crimes against the people, and thoroughly destroying the ruling institutions that the U.S. and puppet forces have built over more than ten years. About 400,000 people in Hue City and its suburbs have gained the right to rule. The areas within a radius of five to ten kilometers around Hue City have been liberated.

	Now, the liberated rural areas of Thua Thien Province have connected with Hue City. The people have completely cut off and controlled the important transportation lines from Hai Van Pass to Hue and from Hue to Quang Tri.

	The people in the newly liberated areas of these two provinces are actively defending their victory. They are vigorously constructing fortifications, building combat villages and combat neighborhoods. Many communes have organized armed self-defense teams, who actively fight the enemy, capture prisoners, and seize enemy weapons. Young people are enthusiastically joining the revolutionary armed forces, and women have formed transportation teams, medical teams, catering teams, and communication liaison teams to serve the battle.
