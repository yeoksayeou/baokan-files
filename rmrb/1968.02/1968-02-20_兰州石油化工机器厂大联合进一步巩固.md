The two revolutionary mass organizations at Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory reached an agreement on a great alliance in late December last year and established a Great Alliance Committee. However, due to factionalism, although the organizations had united, their thoughts had not truly united.

To address this situation, the supporting leftist troops stationed at the factory helped the leaders of both factions turn the Great Alliance Committee into a study class of Mao Zedong Thought. They organized the leaders to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and jointly combat factionalism. The leaders of both factions made self-criticisms, eliminated misunderstandings, and brought their thoughts closer together.

Subsequently, under the leadership of the leaders of both factions and with the help of the supporting leftist troops stationed at the factory, both factions jointly established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They organized the masses of both factions to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, greatly accelerating the steps of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination. Out of the thirteen departments at the factory level, eleven achieved revolutionary great alliance, and seven established revolutionary committees.

The wave of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination at the grassroots level pushed the leaders of both factions in the Great Alliance Committee to begin discussing the issue of achieving revolutionary three-in-one combination. With the help of the supporting leftist troops stationed at the factory and the old workers, both factions quickly reached an agreement, established the factory-wide revolutionary committee, achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination, and consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance.

    兰州石油化工机器厂大联合进一步巩固
    兰州石油化工机器厂两派革命群众组织，在去年十二月初就达成了大联合协议，成立了大联合委员会。但是，由于派性作怪，组织上虽然联合了，思想上并没有真正联合。
    针对这种情况，驻厂支左部队帮助两派组织头头把大联合委员会办成毛泽东思想学习班，组织他们认真学习毛主席的最新指示，共同围剿派性。两派头头各自做了自我批评，隔阂消除了，思想接近了。
    接着，在两派头头的带动和驻厂支左部队的帮助下，两派又联合办起毛泽东思想学习班，组织两派的群众在一起学习毛主席的最新指示，革命大联合和革命三结合的步伐就大大加快了。全厂十三个分厂一级的部门，有十一个实现了革命大联合，有七个成立了革命委员会。
    基层部门实现革命大联合和革命三结合的浪潮，推动大联合委员会的两派头头开始协商实现革命三结合的问题。在驻厂支左部队和老工人的帮助下，两派很快达成了协议，建立了全厂的革命委员会，实现了革命三结合，巩固和发展了革命大联合。　（据新华社讯）
