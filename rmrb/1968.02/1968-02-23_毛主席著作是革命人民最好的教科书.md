The other top capitalist-roader within the Party has long stood on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, using the pretext of youth needing to learn "knowledge" to fiercely oppose our study of Chairman Mao's works. He rants on about how "organizing youth to read in various ways" and "the more basic knowledge, the more lively." The other top capitalist-roader within the Party talks only about "learning knowledge," never about studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming one's ideology. His wicked intentions are not obvious? We revolutionary youth want to emphasize politics, want the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely do not want the so-called "knowledge" of the other top capitalist-roader within the Party. His so-called "knowledge" is knowledge for promotion and wealth, knowledge for fame and success, bourgeois knowledge. Following his line will only cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

The other top capitalist-roader within the Party slanders that studying Chairman Mao's works narrows one's knowledge base. This is utterly reactionary! Does studying Chairman Mao's works narrow one's knowledge base? No! Absolutely not! Chairman Mao's books are a treasure trove of knowledge, an ocean of wisdom, a source of strength, and a revolutionary direction. Mao Zedong Thought is the best revolutionary textbook, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Among the classics of Marxism-Leninism, we must first study Chairman Mao's works well. Take me for example, before I enlisted, I was an ignorant peasant boy who knew nothing. In this great school of Mao Zedong Thought that is the People's Liberation Army, I read Chairman Mao's books and learned many revolutionary truths. Chairman Mao's books showed me a boundlessly bright revolutionary path. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood that in a socialist society, classes still exist, and there is still sharp and complex class struggle. It was Chairman Mao's books that made me understand the root cause of the suffering of the poor. It was Chairman Mao's books that made me see the importance of the gun, the importance of political power. It was Chairman Mao who taught me to care about state affairs and actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the Cultural Revolution, I took up the pen as a weapon and fired at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In one year, I wrote over four hundred and fifty articles, denouncing their heinous counter-revolutionary crimes. All of this was made possible by the strength and wisdom given to me by Chairman Mao's books.

Countless ironclad facts prove: Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the encyclopedia of the proletariat, the lifeline of revolutionary soldiers. Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. With Mao Zedong Thought, any great difficulty can be overcome, any science can be mastered, and any miracle can be created.

We revolutionary soldiers have boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and for Chairman Mao's books. Whoever opposes studying Chairman Mao's works, we will mercilessly overthrow them!

    毛主席著作是革命人民最好的教科书
    工程兵某部战士　王万旗
    党内另一个最大走资派，长期以来，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，打着青年人要学“知识”的幌子，猖狂反对我们学习毛主席著作。他胡说什么：“多方面组织青年读书”，“基本知识多了，也就活了。”
    党内另一个最大的走资派，张口“学知识”，闭口“学知识”，可就是不谈学习毛主席著作，改造思想，其狼子野心不是昭然若揭吗？我们革命青年要的是突出政治，要的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，而决不要党内另一个最大的走资派所谓的“知识”。他的所谓“知识”，是升官发财的知识，是成名成家的知识，是资产阶级的知识。照他那一套去做，只会为资产阶级培养接班人，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    党内另一个最大的走资派诬蔑学习毛主席著作把知识面搞窄了，这简直是反动透顶！学习毛主席著作把知识面搞窄了吗？不！绝不！毛主席的书，是知识的宝库，智慧的海洋，力量的源泉，革命的方向。毛泽东思想是最好的革命教科书，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。在马克思列宁主义的经典著作中，我们首先要学好毛主席著作。拿我来说，我入伍前，本是一个什么也不懂的苦孩子。在解放军这个毛泽东思想的大学校里，我读了毛主席的书，懂得了很多革命的道理，毛主席的书给我指出了一条无限光明的革命大路。学习了毛主席著作，我知道了在社会主义社会里，阶级还存在，还有尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。是毛主席的书，使我认识到穷人受苦受罪的根源。是毛主席的书使我看清了枪杆子的重要，政权的重要。是毛主席教导我关心国家大事，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命。在文化大革命中我拿起笔作刀枪，向党内最大的一小撮走资派开火。一年当中，我写了四百五十多篇文章，口诛笔伐他们的反革命滔天罪行。所有这些都是毛主席的书给了我力量和智慧。
    无数铁的事实证明：毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是无产阶级的百科全书，是我们革命战士的命根子。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力。有了毛泽东思想，天大的困难都能克服，什么科学都能掌握，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    我们革命战士，对伟大领袖毛主席，对毛主席的书无限热爱，谁反对学习毛主席著作，我们就毫不留情地把他打倒！
