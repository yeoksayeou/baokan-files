The All-China Journalists Association sent a telegram on February 19 to the *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Tianfeng Daily*, and *Xinwu Daily*, warmly congratulating them and Hong Kong patriots on their heroic and unyielding struggle to reopen the newspapers on February 18. The telegram pointed out that the reopening of the three patriotic newspapers is another victory for Hong Kong patriots and patriotic journalists in their struggle against British imperialism and violence. It declares the failure of the Hong Kong British authorities' fascist attempt to suppress Hong Kong's patriotic press and journalists and to stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, thereby extinguishing the flames of the patriotic struggle against British imperialism and violence in Hong Kong.

The telegram said that under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Hong Kong patriots and patriotic journalists have shown great courage and determination in their struggle against British imperialism, defending the dignity of the Chinese nation. You are truly excellent sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.

The telegram said, "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the thousands and tens of thousands of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries." We believe that the three patriotic newspapers, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, will be able to better carry out anti-imperialist and patriotic propaganda work after their reopening, uniting the broad masses of patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and continuing the struggle against British imperialism and violence to the end.

The telegram expressed that the people and journalists of the motherland, who are fighting for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly support the struggle of Hong Kong patriots and patriotic journalists against British imperialism and violence, and pledge to be your strong backing.

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, February 19 - The *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Xinwu Daily*, and *Tianfeng Daily*, which were forced to cease publication for half a year due to persecution by the Hong Kong British authorities, reopened on February 18 amidst the warm congratulations of Hong Kong patriots. All staff members are filled with more vigorous spirit and stronger fighting will to continue the struggle for the patriotic press and anti-imperialist cause.

These three newspapers were forced to cease publication on August 17 last year by the Hong Kong British authorities on the pretext of "continuing to publish inflammatory news" and other fabricated charges. The Hong Kong British authorities also illegally "sentenced" five responsible persons of the *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Tianfeng Daily*, and the Nanchang Printing Company, which printed the three newspapers, to three years in prison each, and they are still illegally imprisoned. The Hong Kong British authorities also illegally searched the offices of the three newspapers and illegally beat the staff. The responsible persons and staff of the three newspapers have maintained their patriotic and anti-imperialist stance in the face of various persecutions by the enemy and have fought bravely. After the three newspapers were forced to cease publication, Hong Kong patriots successively established seven or eight hundred anti-British and anti-violence small newspapers, which, with sharp and biting words, strongly exposed the various atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities and effectively counterattacked the persecution of the patriotic press by the Hong Kong British authorities. The Hong Kong British authorities attempted to suppress the spread of truth through various persecutions, but the result was that they "lifted a stone only to drop it on their own feet."

On February 18, the *Hong Kong Evening News*, *Xinwu Daily*, and *Tianfeng Daily* jointly held a celebration banquet to mark their reopening. Representatives of the three newspapers spoke at the banquet, expressing their heartfelt thanks to the people of the motherland and Hong Kong patriots for their support in their struggle, and stated that the staff of the three newspapers will definitely study the invincible Mao Zedong Thought more diligently in the future, hold high the banner of patriotism and anti-imperialism, and fight together with Hong Kong patriots, win together, and contribute their strength to the final victory of the struggle against British imperialism and violence.

    中国记协热烈电贺香港三家爱国报纸复刊
    三报爱国新闻工作者决心更加努力学习毛泽东思想，为夺取反英抗暴斗争最后胜利贡献力量
    新华社二十二日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会十九日打电报给《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和《新午报》，热烈祝贺他们和香港爱国同胞经过英勇不屈的斗争在二月十八日复刊。贺电指出，三家爱国报纸的复刊，是香港爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者在反英抗暴斗争中的又一胜利，宣告了港英当局妄图用迫害香港爱国新闻事业和爱国新闻工作者的法西斯手段，阻止毛泽东思想的传播，扑灭香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争烈火的阴谋诡计的又一次失败。
    贺电说，香港爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏精神，同港英帝国主义进行了针锋相对的斗争，维护了中华民族的尊严。你们不愧为中华民族的好儿女。
    贺电说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”我们相信，三家爱国报纸在复刊后一定能够在毛泽东思想指引下，更好地开展反帝爱国宣传工作，团结广大港九爱国同胞，把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    贺电表示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而奋斗的祖国人民和新闻工作者，坚决支持香港爱国同胞和爱国新闻工作者反英抗暴的斗争，誓作你们的强大后盾。
    新华社香港十九日电　横遭港英当局迫害停刊半年的《香港夜报》、《新午报》和《田丰日报》三家爱国报纸，在香港爱国同胞热烈的祝贺声中，十八日复刊，全体职工以更加蓬勃的朝气和更加旺盛的斗志为爱国新闻事业和爱国反帝事业继续战斗。
    这三家报纸是在去年八月十七日被港英当局以所谓“继续刊出煽动性新闻”等莫须有“罪名”迫令停刊的。港英当局还非法“判决”《香港夜报》、《田丰日报》和承印三报的南昌印务公司的五位负责人各入狱三年，至今仍被非法监禁狱中。港英当局还非法搜查三家报社和非法毒打职工。三报的负责人和职工们在敌人的种种迫害面前，始终坚持爱国反帝立场，进行了英勇的斗争。在三报被迫停刊后，香港爱国同胞先后创办了七、八百种反英抗暴小报，它们用尖锐泼辣的文字，狠揭港英当局的种种暴行，有力地反击港英当局对爱国新闻事业的迫害。港英当局妄图用种种迫害来遏制真理的传播，结果是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    十八日，《香港夜报》、《新午报》和《田丰日报》联合举行了庆祝复刊酒会。三报代表在酒会上致词，衷心感谢祖国人民和香港爱国同胞对他们斗争的支持，并表示，三报职工今后一定要更加努力学习战无不胜的毛泽东思想，高举爱国反帝大旗，与香港爱国同胞一道，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，为夺取反英抗暴斗争的最后胜利贡献自己的力量。
