The large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in Gaixian County, Liaoning Province, have significantly promoted the thought revolutionization of cadres. Most cadres have quickly liberated their minds, put down their burdens, and are now more enthusiastic about revolution and production.

The county, communes, and farms started these study classes in early June last year, focusing on solving the ideological problems of grassroots cadres. The classes have greatly enhanced the cadres' revolutionary spirit. Most cadres have quickly liberated their minds, put down their burdens, and are now more enthusiastic about revolution and production.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has had the greatest impact on cadres, touching their souls the deepest. However, some cadres still struggle to distinguish between the mainstream and the sidestreams of the mass movement. In the storm of class struggle, they fear this and that, lack revolutionary enthusiasm, and lack confidence in their work.

To address this situation, the study classes prioritized ideological education as the first step in criticizing and repudiating revisionism. They linked the great situation of the cultural revolution nationwide with the great situation in the county. In the classes, they emphasized the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victories of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, the brilliant achievements of the People's Liberation Army's "three supports, two militaries" work, and the great deeds of the revolutionary masses and Red Guards. They also held serious discussions. The cadres' ideological understanding has greatly improved. Some armed cadres, who previously did not appreciate the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses in their support-left work, now reflect, "In the past, I saw more of the sidestreams and less of the mainstream; I saw more flaws and less of the big picture. This shows that I have not completely stood on Mao Zedong's revolutionary line. In the future, I must unite with the revolutionary masses heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder in the battle."

The fundamental purpose of holding large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes is to criticize and repudiate revisionism and to educate cadres to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Therefore, in addition to emphasizing the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the classes also highlighted Mao Zedong's great contributions to the Chinese and world revolutions as a crucial learning content. Many people were moved to tears after studying and voluntarily engaged in self-criticism, examining the "self" in their minds. A cadre from a production brigade in Nuanquan Commune, who had stood up to participate in the leadership of the revolution and production after repeated help from the masses, still felt "frustrated" and wanted to quit. This time, he said emotionally, "Chairman Mao has been working day and night for the Chinese revolution and world revolution for decades, leading the revolution from victory to victory. But I have flaws, the masses help me, and I still can't understand, wanting to quit the revolution. Isn't this ungrateful? Can I face Chairman Mao?"

After returning from the study, he immediately organized the masses to visit the Xian Gou Brigade and invited the active learners of Mao Zedong Thought from the Xian Gou Brigade to give a report in his brigade, establishing a Mao Zedong Thought study class. As a result, this brigade became an advanced unit in the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the entire commune.

The study classes followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and according to the different situations of each batch of students, they focused on different key points and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and repudiation. Rural cadres focused on criticizing the revisionist fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" by Liu Shaoqi; industrial, financial, and commercial system cadres and workers focused on settling accounts with Liu Shaoqi's crimes of peddling "exploitation is glorious" and opposing the emphasis on politics and promoting material incentives; educational system staff focused on exposing and criticizing the revisionist educational line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his black henchmen. This clear contrast deepened the students' infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their intense hatred for Liu Shaoqi. Many cadres also studied the "Old Three Articles" while linking their thoughts, recalling bitterness and sweetness, and severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's crimes of peddling bourgeois selfishness and restoring capitalism.

Some grassroots cadres in rural areas have the words "resentment," "fear," "difficulty," "pride," and "reliance" in their minds. "Resentment" refers to having resentment in the cultural revolution, wanting to quit; "fear" refers to fearing to offend people and fearing to make mistakes, not daring to take responsibility; "difficulty" refers to feeling that the current dual burdens of revolution and production are heavy, with great pressure, and having a sense of difficulty; "pride" refers to some newly elected leaders who have become arrogant and self-satisfied after gaining power; "reliance" refers to relying solely on superiors and the help of the PLA agricultural support troops.

To address these active thoughts, the study classes focused on solving the problems of "resentment," "fear," and "difficulty" through the active study and application of the "Old Three Articles." The cadres used "completely," "thoroughly," and two "extremes" as mirrors to expose their thoughts, dig out their selfishness, and thoroughly criticize the "self" in their minds. A cadre from a production brigade in Lutun Commune was criticized by the masses in the cultural revolution and had unresolved thoughts, wanting to quit. In the study class, he studied the "Old Three Articles," severely criticized the "self," and had a great change in his thoughts. He said, "The past wrong thoughts were ultimately because the 'self' was in charge, compared to Zhang Zedong and Bai Qiu'en, it was unacceptable, this is still a communist! In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao to do revolution forever and will never be a deserter." A cadre from a production team in Xutun Commune previously relied on commandism and piecework to manage work; in the cultural revolution, he was criticized by the masses and had resentment. During the discussion in the study class, he said, "The sky does not resent, the earth does not resent, the past work was not done well, it was because I did not study the 'Old Three Articles' well; the masses criticized me, not for anything else, but because there is no Mao Zedong Thought in my mind!" After returning to the team, he took the lead in emphasizing politics, took the lead in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and made the revolution and production booming.

The cadres, through the intensive study of the "Old Three Articles," formed a self-aware revolutionary fervor in the study classes to criticize the "self" and praise the "public," criticize the "self" and praise the "public," break the "self" and establish the "public." They said, "Living for the revolution, life is worth a thousand gold; living for oneself, it is not worth a needle." Those who previously had the emotions of "resentment," "fear," and "difficulty" generally resolved their ideological knots after repeatedly studying the "Old Three Articles" and had more revolutionary spirit.

    大办毛泽东思想学习班很解决问题
    盖县广大基层干部通过学习，解放了思想，放下了包袱，革命劲头更足了
    本报讯　辽宁省盖县从去年六月初开始，以解决基层干部的思想问题为中心，由县、公社和农场分别大办毛泽东思想学习班，大大地促进了干部的思想革命化。大多数干部迅速地解放了思想，放下了包袱，轻装上阵，抓革命促生产的干劲倍增。
      把形势教育列为斗私批修开门课
    这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，对干部教育最大，触及灵魂最深。然而，有一部分干部还不能很好地分清群众运动的主流和支流，在阶级斗争的暴风雨中，怕这怕那，革命干劲不足，工作缺乏信心。
    针对这种情况，学习班就把形势教育列为斗私批修的开门课。他们把全国文化大革命的大好形势同本县的大好形势联系起来，在学员中大讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，大讲中国人民解放军“三支”“两军”工作的辉煌成就，大讲无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将的丰功伟绩，并且认真座谈讨论。干部们的思想认识大大提高。有的武装干部原来在支左工作中，对革命群众的革命造反精神看不惯；现在检查说：“过去，对革命造反派看支流多，看主流少；看缺点多，看大方向少。这说明自己没有完全站在毛主席的革命路线一边，今后一定要与革命派心连心，肩并肩地参加战斗。”暖泉公社一个大队民兵连长说：“过去我对‘乱’很不理解，这次才真正认识到‘乱’的不是别人，而是乱了阶级敌人。党内一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神被乱出来了，真是大好事！”
        教育基层干部无限忠于毛主席
    大办毛泽东思想学习班的最根本目的，就是要斗私，批修，就是要教育干部无限忠于毛主席。因此，学习班除大抓活学活用毛主席著作以外，把毛主席对中国革命和世界革命的伟大贡献，列为极重要的学习内容。许多人学习以后，感动得热泪盈眶，纷纷自觉地开展自我批评，检查头脑中的“私”字。暖泉公社一个大队干部，在群众多次帮助下站起来参加抓革命促生产领导班子以后，仍感到“窝火”，想撂挑子不干。这次，他感动地说：“毛主席他老人家为了中国革命和世界革命，日夜操心，几十年如一日，领导革命从胜利走向胜利。可是我有缺点，群众帮助我，还想不通，想不干革命了，这不是忘本吗？能对得起毛主席他老人家吗？”学习回去以后，他立即组织群众去线沟大队参观，并请线沟大队学习毛主席著作积极分子去本队作报告，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，结果这个大队成了全公社活学活用毛主席著作的先进队。
    学习班紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，根据每期学员不同情况，突出不同重点，深入开展了革命大批判。农村干部重点批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义谬论；工业、财贸系统干部、职工重点清算了中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖“剥削有功”的黑货和反对突出政治、大搞物质刺激的罪行；文教系统教职员工，着重地揭发批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其黑爪牙所推行的修正主义教育路线。这样鲜明对照，就加深了学员们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。许多干部还一边学习“老三篇”，一边联系自己的思想，忆苦思甜，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所贩卖的资产阶级利己主义和复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
      大学“老三篇”，大造“私”字的反
    农村基层干部中有些人思想上存在着“怨”、“怕”、“难”、“骄”、“靠”五个字。“怨”就是在文化大革命中，受到了批评，有“怨气”，想撂挑子不干；
  “怕”就是怕得罪人，怕犯错误，不敢大胆负责；“难”就是认为当前担负革命、生产两副重担，任务重，压力大，有畏难情绪；“骄”就是部分新选进领导班子的干部，掌权以后滋长了骄傲自满情绪；“靠”就是单纯依靠上级，依靠解放军支农部队的帮助。
    针对这些活思想，学习班通过活学活用“老三篇”，着重解决了“怨”、“怕”、“难”这三个问题。干部们用“完全”、“彻底”和两个“极端”作镜子，亮思想，挖私心，大造自己头脑中“私”字的反。芦屯公社一个大队干部在文化大革命中受到群众批评，思想不通，想撂挑子。在学习班上，他学习了“老三篇”，狠斗了“私”字，思想大转变，他说：“过去的错误想法，归根到底是‘私’字当了家，和张思德、白求恩对比，太不象话了，这还算得上什么共产党员！今后我决心永远跟毛主席干革命，绝不当逃兵。”徐屯公社一个生产队干部过去抓工作，一靠命令主义，二靠工分挂帅；在文化大革命中，受到群众批评，有“怨气”。在学习班上讨论时，他说：“天不怨，地不怨，过去工作没干好，就怨我没学习好‘老三篇’；群众批评我，不是为了别的，就是因为我头脑里没有毛泽东思想！”回队以后，他带头突出政治，带头活学活用毛主席著作，使革命和生产搞得热气腾腾。
    干部们通过大学“老三篇”，在学习班上形成一个斗“私”爱“公”，批“私”赞“公”，破“私”立“公”的自觉革命热潮。他们说：“活着为革命，生命值千金；活着为个人，不如一根针。”过去曾有“怨”、“怕”、“难”情绪的干部，经过反复学习“老三篇”，一般都解开了思想疙瘩，革命劲头更足了。
