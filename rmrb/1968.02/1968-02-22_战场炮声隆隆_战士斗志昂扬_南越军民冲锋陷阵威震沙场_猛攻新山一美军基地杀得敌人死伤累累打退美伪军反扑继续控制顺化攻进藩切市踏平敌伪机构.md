In the vast battlefields of South Vietnam, inspiring victories have been reported from various regions in recent days. The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, with high morale and unyielding spirit, are continuing to fiercely annihilate the enemy while advancing.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and civilian people of the Saigon-Cho Lon region launched five consecutive fierce attacks on the important military base of the American puppet group, New Mountain One Airbase, from the early hours of the 18th to the night of the 20th, achieving brilliant results. They annihilated over 500 enemy troops (most of whom were American pilots and technicians) and destroyed nearly 20 aircraft.

In the first attack launched on the night of the 17th and the early hours of the 18th, the revolutionary army's hundreds of shells accurately hit various targets within the airbase, including the headquarters of the American commander in Vietnam, General Westmoreland. The command tower inside the airbase was destroyed at the beginning of the battle. The tarmac was engulfed in flames, with fuel splashing everywhere. The runway was pockmarked with craters. Enemy corpses lay scattered everywhere. The remaining enemy troops were in a state of panic, scrambling to flee in all directions. At this moment, the revolutionary army's assault teams, like a breached dam, surged into the airbase from all directions, and batch after batch of enemy troops fell under the assault rifles of the brave assault troops. That day, the revolutionary army in the Saigon-Cho Lon region annihilated over 400 American puppet troops.

The enemy, still in shock, was dealt another heavy blow by the revolutionary army at noon on the 18th, with nearly 100 American invaders killed or wounded.

In the early hours of the 19th, at noon on the 20th, and in the night, the revolutionary army in the Saigon-Cho Lon region did not give the enemy any respite, launching three more consecutive artillery strikes on the airbase, annihilating more American invaders, destroying more aircraft, and demolishing many buildings within the airbase.

The military and civilian people of Hue, who had been fighting bravely for 20 days, repelled the counterattacks of the American invaders and South Korean mercenaries from three directions on the 19th, annihilating over 200 enemy troops and continuing to control Hue.

In the fierce battles at Dong Ba Gate and Thuan Phuoc Gate, the enemy suffered over 150 casualties but still could not advance. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces calmly and bravely waited until the enemy was very close before opening fierce fire, and then charged into the enemy ranks, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, using bayonets to annihilate large numbers of enemy troops.

The day before, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Hue attacked the scoundrels and puppet government officials in the Kun Hien area to the east of the city, capturing nearly 400 scoundrels and puppet government officials who had fled to the area from various places.

The brave and resilient military and civilian people of Hue are standing in battle formation, ready to smash the enemy's new counterattacks.

The military and civilian people of Phuoc Tuy Province, building on the victory of the New Year's offensive, launched a simultaneous attack on multiple targets within the provincial capital of Phuoc Tuy, including the enemy's Quang Trung Military Training Camp, the puppet government office, and the prison, as well as the Phuoc Hiep and Thuan Liem districts, at 1:30 AM on the 18th. They captured the various ruling institutions of the puppet government and occupied the Phuoc Tuy Garden District, Ba Me District, Quang Trung Military Training Camp, and the prison, liberating over 700 patriots imprisoned there.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces in My Tho Province launched a fierce attack on the enemy's base at the fourth military district on the 18th at dawn, annihilating nearly 100 enemy troops of the puppet army's 7th Division, 12th Regiment, 1st Battalion stationed at the base. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces quickly rushed into the town, attacked the puppet government office, annihilated 30 bodyguards of the puppet county chief, and burned down an ammunition depot.

The people of Cai Lay Town celebrated their victory with drums and gongs. On the 18th, over 800 people from the surrounding rural areas joined the townspeople in a demonstration march.

The military and civilian people of Long An Province launched a fierce attack on the puppet provincial government office, the military small district, the artillery position in the new street district, the Long An Airbase, the 23rd warship base of the puppet army, and the 15th Regiment's garrison and many other important targets within Long An City at dawn on the 18th. The liberation forces and local people controlled many districts within Long An City.

By the 19th, the battle within Long An City was still ongoing.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces in Chau Doc Province launched a fierce attack on the American Deo Dai Airbase and the Sung Mountain Heights on the night of the 17th, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

On the 18th, the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces launched a second powerful offensive against the American invaders, destroying the American military aircraft at the New Mountain One Airbase, leaving them in a state of disrepair and disarray.

    在十七日夜间和十八日凌晨发动的第一次袭击中，革命军的成百发炮弹准确地击中机场内的各个目标，其中包括侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰的总部。机场内的指挥台在战斗一开始就被击坏。停机坪上烈火熊熊燃烧，汽油四处飞溅。机场跑道上弹坑累累。敌人的尸体到处都是。残存的敌人惊慌万状，争先恐后地四处逃窜。正在这时，革命军的各路突击队象决堤的洪水一样从各个方向冲进机场，一批又一批的敌人在英勇的突击队员的冲锋枪下丧命。这天，西贡—嘉定地区革命军就消灭美伪军四百多名。

    在这前一天，顺化市人民解放武装力量袭击了市东面昆献地区的恶棍和伪政权人员，全部俘虏从各地逃到这里的恶棍和伪政权人员近四百名。
    英勇顽强的顺化军民，正严阵以待，准备粉碎敌人的新的反扑。
    平顺省军民发扬新春大捷的胜利，在二月十八日凌晨一时三十分，分成多路，同时向省会藩切市内的敌军光忠军事训练营、伪政权办事处和监狱等一系列目标，以及平兴和兴隆两个街区展开进攻，攻克了伪政权的各个统治机构，并且占领了藩切花园区、巴梅街区、光忠军事训练营和监狱，解放了被监禁在狱中的七百多名爱国者。
