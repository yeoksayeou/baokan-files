The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front recently held an expanded extraordinary meeting under the chairmanship of President Ho Chi Minh to discuss the great victories achieved by the military and civilians in South Vietnam during the Lunar New Year. The meeting issued a statement calling on all Vietnamese military and civilians to advance bravely and completely defeat the American aggressors and the puppet traitor group.

The statement said: The military and civilians in South Vietnam have launched a series of attacks on cities, including Saigon, Hue, Da Nang, and many important enemy bases on the South Vietnamese battlefield. People in enemy-occupied areas have also risen up to support the People's Liberation Armed Forces in striking the enemy. This is an unprecedented and extremely significant victory for the military and civilians in the South, both militarily and politically. The American aggressors and their puppets have suffered unprecedented heavy defeats, which have plunged the enemy into a state of extreme panic, disarray, and passivity.

The statement pointed out that these great victories are the result of the deep patriotic sentiments of the Vietnamese people and their intense hatred for the crimes committed by the American aggressors and their puppets over the past decade. They are also the result of the united strength of the people, based on the political program of the National Liberation Front.

The statement said: The brilliant victories achieved by the military and civilians in South Vietnam in recent days have proven the invincible power of people's war, demonstrated the strong offensive advantage of the South's military and civilians, and also shown the rapid growth and inevitable victory of the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians.

The statement said: The struggle of the Vietnamese people will face many severe tests. As Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out, "The nature of American imperialism is unchanging, and it has not abandoned its aggressive plans." The enemy will certainly use brutal and cunning methods to make a desperate struggle. However, the complete defeat of the American aggressors and their puppets is inevitable.

The statement firmly believes that the heroic military and civilians in the South will continue to advance, unite more closely, launch continuous attacks, and decisively achieve the greatest victory. The statement calls on the people of North Vietnam to stay vigilant, be ready to smash all escalations of the American aggressors' war at any time, and spare no effort to support the liberation cause in the South, fulfilling the duty of the rear to the front.

The statement finally said: The 31 million military and civilians of the entire country are determined to fully implement Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, unite as one, contribute all their strength, completely defeat the American aggressors and the puppet traitor group, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately achieve the peaceful reunification of the country.

    声明说：越南南方军民连日来一举进攻一系列城镇，包括西贡、顺化、岘港和南越战场上的许多敌军重要基地。敌占区人民也纷纷起来配合人民解放武装力量打击敌人。这是南方军民在军事上和政治上取得的前所未有的极其重大的胜利。美国侵略者及其走狗遭到了空前惨重的失败，这些失败使敌人陷入极其惊慌、狼狈和被动的处境。

    声明说，越南南方军民几天来的辉煌胜利，证明了无敌的人民战争的无穷威力，体现了南方军民强大的主动进攻优势，也体现了英雄的南方军民的飞跃成长和必胜的优势。
    声明说：越南人民的战斗还要经受许多严峻的考验。正如胡志明主席指出的：“美帝国主义的本性是至死不变的，它没有放弃侵略阴谋。”敌人一定还要采取残暴、狡猾的手段，进行垂死的挣扎。然而，美国强盗及其走狗的彻底失败是不可避免的了。
    声明坚信，英雄的南方军民必将继续乘胜前进，更加紧密团结，连续进攻，坚决夺取最大的胜利。声明号召越南北方人民提高警惕，随时准备粉碎美国强盗的一切战争升级行动，竭尽全力支持南方的解放事业，履行大后方对大前线的义务。
    声明最后说，越南全国三千一百万军民决心彻底实现胡志明主席的号召，同心同德，贡献出自己的全部力量，彻底战胜美国侵略强盗和卖国傀儡集团，解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。
