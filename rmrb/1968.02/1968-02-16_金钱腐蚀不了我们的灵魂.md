Money Cannot Corrupt Our Souls

Beijing Municipal Transportation Company, Bus Depot 8, Li Yongfu

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party says: “Material incentives are necessary.”

Another biggest capitalist-roader within the Party says: “Our revolution relies on material incentives.”

Based on this reactionary logic, a black wind swept through our factory in recent years, vigorously advocating the fallacy of “reward the brave with high pay,” promoting bonuses and money as the guiding principles, and pushing for material incentives to poison revolutionary workers with bourgeois selfishness and numb their revolutionary will.

These two biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party advocate bonuses as the guiding principle and push for material incentives, which is to promote everything starting from “self,” attempting to corrupt the souls of the working class with the capitalist “self.” Their plot is to restore capitalism in China and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Serve the people wholeheartedly.” A true revolutionary, a good Communist Party member, must be selfless, fearless, and dedicated to the people, putting the revolution and the people first, and serving the people of China and the world wholeheartedly.

Whether to serve the public or the self is a fundamental contradiction between the worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. For the exploiting classes, “self” is sacred and inviolable. The “self” advocated by the two biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party is precisely the “self” of the exploiting classes. What they promote is the bourgeois and all exploiting classes’ worldview of “if you don’t seek personal gain, you deserve to be killed by heaven and earth.”

Let’s look at how revolutionary martyrs and heroes do it! Countless outstanding Party members and revolutionary martyrs of our Party, for the liberation of the Chinese people and the people of the world, bravely rushed forward, one after another, living gloriously and dying honorably. When Dong Cunrui held the explosive package to blow up the enemy’s fort, he thought of opening the way for his comrades! When Qiu Shaoyun was on fire in front of the enemy, he thought of not exposing the target to ensure the safety of all comrades and the victory of the battle! When Comrade Cai Yongxiang rushed towards the speeding train to remove the sabotage set by class enemies on the track, he thought of rescuing Chairman Mao’s Red Guards and protecting the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat! When Li Wenzhong and the heroes of the Fourth Platoon were in the critical moment of crossing the Gan River in danger, they thought of supporting the left and loving the people, rescuing the Red Guard youths in the great winds and waves! These selfless and heroic communist warriors, they thought of the revolution, the people, and the highest interests of the Party and the state. Their sublime thoughts and glorious deeds will forever be our examples to learn from.

What “material incentives are necessary,” what “our revolution relies on material incentives,” this is a great insult to revolutionary martyrs and heroes! This is a great insult to our working class!

Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We, the working class, must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, fight against selfishness, criticize revisionism, break down the “self,” establish the “public,” break down the bourgeois worldview, and establish the proletarian worldview, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

    金钱腐蚀不了我们的灵魂

    党内最大的走资派胡说：“物质刺激是必要的。”
    党内另一个最大的走资派胡说：“我们革命都靠物质刺激。”
    就是根据这种反动逻辑，前些年，在我们厂里刮起了一阵黑风，拚命宣扬“重赏之下，必有勇夫”的谬论，鼓吹奖金挂帅，钞票挂帅，大搞物质刺激，用资产阶级的利己主义来毒害革命职工，麻痹革命职工的革命意志。
    这两个党内最大的走资派宣扬奖金挂帅，大搞物质刺激，就是鼓吹一切从“私”字出发，企图用资本主义的一个“私”字，来腐蚀我们工人阶级的灵魂。他们的阴谋就是要在中国复辟资本主义，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为中国人民服务”。一个真正的革命者，一个好的共产党员，必须是不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，毫不利己，专门利人，一心为革命，一心为人民，全心全意地为中国人民和世界人民服务。
    为公还是为私，这是无产阶级与资产阶级两种根本对立的世界观。对于剥削阶级说来，“私”字是神圣不可侵犯的。党内两个最大的走资派所宣扬的正是剥削阶级的“私”字，他们所鼓吹的正是“人不为己，天诛地灭”的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的世界观。
    让我们来看看革命先烈和革命英雄是怎么做的吧！我们党的无数优秀党员和革命先烈，为了中国人民和世界人民的解放事业，赴汤蹈火，前赴后继，他们生的伟大，死的光荣。当董存瑞手托炸药包炸毁敌人碉堡的时候，他想到的是为战友们开辟前进的道路！当邱少云在敌前埋伏全身着火的时候，他想到的是千万不要暴露目标，以保证全体同志的安全和战斗的胜利！当蔡永祥同志迎着飞奔的列车，排除阶级敌人设置在轨道上的故障的时候，他想到的是抢救毛主席的红卫兵和保卫无产阶级文化大革命！当李文忠和英雄四排的同志们在横渡赣江遇险的万分紧急时刻，他们想到的是支左爱民，在大风大浪中抢救红卫兵小将！这些一心为公、英勇牺牲的共产主义战士，他们想到的是革命，是人民，是党和国家的最高利益。他们的崇高思想和光荣事迹，永远是我们学习的榜样。
    什么“物质刺激是必要的”，什么“我们革命都靠物质刺激”，这是对革命先烈和革命英雄的莫大侮辱！是对我们工人阶级的莫大侮辱！
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们工人阶级要用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，斗私，批修，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
