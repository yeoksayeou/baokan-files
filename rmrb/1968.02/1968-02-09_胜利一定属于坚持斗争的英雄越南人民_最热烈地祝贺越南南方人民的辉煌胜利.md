The heroic people and soldiers of South Vietnam have launched a mighty and irresistible Tet Offensive, achieving stunning victories that have shocked the world. In just six days, they annihilated over 50,000 enemy troops, including more than 10,000 American invaders, and disbanded 200,000 puppet soldiers. They destroyed over 1,500 enemy aircraft, inflicting a severe military and political defeat on the American aggressors and their lackeys. Currently, the people and soldiers of South Vietnam are advancing in victory, continuing their fierce assaults on battlefields such as Xuan Loc, sweeping away the demoralized American and puppet forces, and seizing new, even greater victories.

This powerful and fierce Tet Offensive has opened a new chapter in the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, pushing the revolutionary struggle of the South Vietnamese people to a new high. This great victory demonstrates the invincible power of the people and soldiers of South Vietnam, showcasing the immense might of people's war, and declaring the shameful failure of American imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam. It has delivered a thunderous blow to the madly expanding war in Vietnam by the American aggressors, a resounding slap to the traitorous Soviet revisionist clique that has been busy serving the "peace talks" scam of the American imperialists, and a fatal strike to the lackeys who have been wholeheartedly serving the American imperialists. The magnificent victory of the Vietnamese people, with their spirits soaring like mountains and rivers, is a great inspiration to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialism, and to the revolutionary people of all countries.

Heroic Vietnamese comrades, you fight bravely! You fight fiercely! You fight beautifully! The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army admire you from the bottom of our hearts and are overjoyed by your great victory! We extend to you our warmest congratulations, our most heartfelt greetings, and our highest respect!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The ultimate power of war lies in the masses."

The great victory of the Tet Offensive by the people of South Vietnam is another magnificent anthem of the people's war. The scale, momentum, organization, and enemy casualties of this offensive are unprecedented in the history of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. It has elevated the people's war in Vietnam to a high level. A distinctive feature of this offensive is the combination of military and civilian forces, urban and rural areas, and internal and external efforts. Wherever the liberation army goes, the broad masses of people in cities and countryside rise up in rebellion, various patriotic forces form a vast revolutionary army, and fight side by side with the liberation army, jointly battling the American aggressors, capturing traitorous scoundrels, and overthrowing the puppet regime, creating a powerful revolutionary storm. Patriotic officers and soldiers in the puppet army turn their guns around in batches and join the fight. Today, in South Vietnam, the political and military power of the people is rapidly growing and developing, not only have the vast rural areas become a vast ocean of people's war, but the cities have also become a vast ocean of people's war.

Under the thunderous hammer of people's war, American imperialism, which claims to be the superpower of the capitalist world, is battered and disheveled, in a state of utter chaos. The series of headquarters and key positions of the American and puppet clique have suffered heavy blows; military bases, airports, barracks, and warehouses have been destroyed; a large number of their combat forces have been annihilated. The puppet regime, which American imperialism has struggled so hard to prop up, is crumbling. Despite pouring 500,000 troops into the South Vietnamese battlefield, the American aggressors have not found a single safe hiding place. This has thoroughly exposed their paper tiger nature. The facts have once again eloquently proven the great truth pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao:

"Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

In this Tet Offensive, the heroic armed forces of South Vietnam have demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism, organizational discipline, and fully utilized the human factor. They fought bravely, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, engaging in continuous battles; they dared to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire, daring to penetrate deep into enemy lairs, fight lone battles, engage in hand-to-hand combat, and charge fiercely; they roamed freely in the lairs of the American and puppet forces, appearing and disappearing like ghosts, achieving victory through surprise tactics. The South Vietnamese people and soldiers' heroic spirit of defying strong enemies, their brave and tenacious fighting style, and their flexible strategies and tactics are worthy of our serious study.

Currently, the situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation is excellent, better than ever before. The Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation is no longer a question of whether they can win or not, nor is it a question of winning big or small; it is an undeniable fact that they will win, and they have already achieved great victories. The American imperialists, who are in an unprecedentedly dire situation, are still not giving up. In recent days, the dispirited and exhausted Johnson has been hastily consulting with American military and political leaders, actively plotting new adventures to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, attempting to make more desperate struggles. However, no matter how big a bet the Johnson administration places, it cannot save itself from its inevitable complete failure.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said in a telegram to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam: "Persistence leads to victory." The great leader of the Vietnamese people, Comrade Ho Chi Minh, also called on the Vietnamese people and soldiers to "persist in the struggle, fight fiercely, and fight continuously to achieve greater victories." The victorious Vietnamese people have made a firm decision to fight to the end. The Vietnamese people, undeterred by all difficulties, will persist in prolonged warfare, fully unleashing the immense power of people's war, continuously annihilating the enemy's combat forces, and will surely achieve the final victory.

Our great commander Chairman Mao said: "The 700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." The struggle of the Vietnamese people is our struggle, and the victory of the Vietnamese people is our victory. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, until every last American aggressor is driven out of Vietnam.

    胜利一定属于坚持斗争的英雄越南人民
    ——最热烈地祝贺越南南方人民的辉煌胜利
    英雄的越南南方军民发动的排山倒海、锐不可挡的新春攻势，取得了震惊世界的辉煌战果。短短六天，歼灭敌军五万多名，其中美国侵略军一万多名，瓦解伪军二十万名，击毁敌机一千五百多架，使美国强盗及其走狗在军事上和政治上、战略上和战术上都遭到了极其惨重的失败。目前，越南南方军民正在乘胜前进，继续在溪星等战场发动猛烈攻势，横扫丧魂落魄的美伪军，夺取新的更加重大的胜利。
  这次强大凌厉的新春攻势，打开了越南人民抗美救国战争的新局面，把越南南方人民的革命斗争推向一个新高潮。这一伟大胜利，显示了越南南方军民无敌的力量，显示了人民战争的无比神威，宣告了美帝国主义侵越政策的可耻破产。它给了疯狂扩大侵越战争的美国强盗一个雷霆万钧的打击，给了加紧为美帝“和谈”骗局奔走效劳的苏修叛徒集团一记响亮的耳光，给了死心塌地为美帝卖命的仆从走狗以致命的一棒。越南人民气壮山河的伟大胜利，对于正在进行反帝革命斗争的亚非拉人民和世界各国革命人民，是一个极大的鼓舞。
    英雄的越南战友们，你们打得猛！打得狠！打得漂亮！中国人民和人民解放军从内心里钦佩你们，为你们的伟大胜利而欢欣鼓舞！我们向你们致以最热烈的祝贺、最亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”
    越南南方人民新春攻势的伟大胜利，是人民战争思想又一曲雄伟壮丽的凯歌。这次攻势规模之大，声势之猛，组织之好，歼敌之多，在越南南方人民的抗美救国战争史上都是空前的。它把越南人民战争发展到了一个高度水平。这次攻势的一个鲜明特点，就是军民结合，城乡结合，内外结合。解放军所到之处，城乡广大人民群众纷纷揭竿而起，各种爱国力量结成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，和解放军紧密配合，共同战斗，痛打美国强盗，追捕越奸恶棍，推翻卖国走狗政权，形成了强大的革命风暴。伪军中的爱国官兵，成批成批地掉转枪口，参加战斗。在今日的越南南方，人民的政治力量和武装力量飞速壮大和成长，不仅广大乡村成了人民战争的汪洋大海，而且城市也成了人民战争的汪洋大海。
    在人民战争雷霆万钧的铁锤下，美帝国主义这个号称资本主义世界的超级大国，被打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。美伪集团一系列首脑机关和各个要害部位，都遭到沉重打击；军事基地、机场、兵营、仓库，被打得七零八落；有生力量被大量消灭。美帝国主义费尽九牛二虎之力所支撑的伪政权，正在土崩瓦解。美国侵略者尽管在南越战场上投入了五十万兵力，结果连一块安全藏身之地都没有。这就彻底地暴露了它的纸老虎真面目。事实再一次雄辩地证明了伟大领袖毛主席所指出的伟大真理：
  “国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    在这次新春攻势中，英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量，发扬了高度的革命英雄主义精神，体现了高度的组织性和纪律性，充分发挥了人的因素的作用。他们英勇战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳，连续作战；他们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，敢于深入敌窠，孤胆作战，敢于刺刀见红，猛打猛冲；他们在美伪的巢穴里，纵横驰骋，神出鬼没，出奇制胜。越南南方军民蔑视强敌的英雄气概、英勇顽强的战斗作风和机动灵活的战略战术，值得我们认真学习。
    当前，越南抗美救国战争形势一片大好，比以往任何时候都好。越南人民的抗美救国战争，已经不是能不能胜利的问题，也不是大胜小胜的问题，而是确定无疑地要胜利，并且已经取得了伟大的胜利。陷入空前严重困境的美帝国主义，仍然贼心不死。连日来，神志沮丧、疲惫不堪的约翰逊，慌忙同美国军政头目频频协商，积极策划扩大侵越战争的新的冒险，妄图进行更加疯狂的垂死挣扎。但是，不管约翰逊政府再下多大赌注，都挽救不了它彻底失败的命运。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在给越南南方民族解放阵线阮友寿主席的贺电中说：“坚持下去就是胜利。”越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席也号召越南军民“坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利”。胜利前进的越南人民已经下定了打到底的坚强决心。越南人民再接再厉，排除万难，坚持持久作战，高度发挥人民战争的巨大威力，不断地消灭敌人的有生力量，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    我们的伟大统帅毛主席说：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”越南人民的斗争，就是我们的斗争，越南人民的胜利，就是我们的胜利。用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和人民解放军，坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者一个不剩地赶出越南去。　                           （二月九日）
