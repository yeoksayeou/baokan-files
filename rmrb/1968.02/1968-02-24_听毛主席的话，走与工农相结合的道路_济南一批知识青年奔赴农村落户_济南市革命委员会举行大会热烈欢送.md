    Follow Chairman Mao's Words, Take the Path of Combining with Workers and Peasants
    A Batch of Young Intellectuals from Jinan Head to the Countryside to Settle Down

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 21st — The Jinan Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a grand meeting on February 19th to warmly send off the first batch of young intellectuals from Jinan heading to the countryside in 1968.

    This batch of young intellectuals heading to the revolutionary base area of Yimeng in Shandong to settle down consists of more than 260 people, all of whom are high school and junior high school graduates who have been tempered and tested during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the meeting, they expressed their great enthusiasm to dedicate their youth to the socialist revolution and construction in the countryside, unanimously declaring that they would resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, go to the countryside, settle down as commune members, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao. They vowed to contribute their strength to turning the countryside into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Wang Xiaoyu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and First Political Commissar of the Jinan Military Region, Yang Dezhi, a leader of the Jinan Military Region, and Yang Enhua, a leader of the Jinan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, attended the send-off meeting. Wang Xiaoyu spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary action of the first batch of young intellectuals from Jinan heading to the countryside in 1968, and encouraging them to forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and wherever they go, plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought there. Wherever they go, they must combine with the local masses, learn from the masses, and be the masses' little students. Wherever they go, they must engage in struggle, and in the great storms of class struggle, temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    Fu Jiaxuan, a leader of the Jinan Military Region, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Jinan Military Region and the Shandong Military Region. Representatives of revolutionary mass organizations and representatives of the parents of the young intellectuals heading to the countryside also spoke at the send-off meeting. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the revolutionary action of the young intellectuals heading to the countryside.

    At the meeting, the Jinan Military Region, Shandong Military Region, Jinan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Jinan Military Sub-district, and various revolutionary mass organizations presented the revolutionary young comrades heading to the countryside with copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao badges.
