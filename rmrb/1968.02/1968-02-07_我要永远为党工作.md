I will forever work for the Party.

Wang Wenjiang, worker of the Air Force

The Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly advocates that Communist Party members should "not fear hardship or adversity," thereby "naturally gaining the support, love, and recommendation of comrades." This is using fame and profit as bait, attempting to lure Party members into the quagmire of revisionism.

I think that a Communist Party member is someone who is "public-minded," who can only serve the people forever, wholeheartedly for the public, and not at all for personal gain. I am 67 years old this year and work as a receptionist at the military family guesthouse. This job may seem ordinary, but it is revolutionary work, serving the people. For more than ten years, I have been serving the broad masses of soldiers. To facilitate the study of Chairman Mao's works by the families of the soldiers, I deliver "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Chairman Mao's Little Red Book" to them. To save national expenses, I wash the bedding of the guesthouse myself. I also use my rest time to pick up empty ink bottles, broken glass, and toothpaste tubes to hand in, contributing my bit to support national socialist construction. Some comrades see that I am old and are afraid I will overwork myself, advising me not to do these things anymore. I say that even though these tasks are small, they express my loyalty to Chairman Mao. Anything that benefits the public, no matter how small, I will do. Anything that benefits the private, no matter how big, I will not do. Only this conforms to Chairman Mao's teachings of being "selfless, industrious, self-disciplined, and dedicated."

The military leadership cares about me very much, fearing that I will overwork myself and preparing to let me retire. When I think of the glorious deeds of Dr. Norman Bethune and the oppressed and exploited people around the world who have not yet been liberated, I feel that I have boundless energy. Although I am old and my body is somewhat disabled, my heart to serve the people is not disabled. After repeated requests, the organization finally agreed to let me not retire for the time being. I am overjoyed from the bottom of my heart. I will forever work for the Party.

The Chinese Khrushchev's talk of fame and profit is a poisonous pill, and we must not be deceived. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, fiercely fight against selfishness, and firmly establish public-mindedness, becoming a Communist Party member who is loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

### 我要永远为党工作

    我要永远为党工作
    空军某部职工　王文江
    中国赫鲁晓夫无耻地宣扬共产党员要“不怕倒霉不怕困苦”，这样便“自然得到同志的拥护爱戴与推荐”。这是以名利为诱饵，妄想把党员拉进修正主义的泥坑。
    我觉着，共产党员就是姓“公”的，只能永远为人民服务，一心为公，不能丝毫为私。我今年六十七岁了，是部队家属招待所的招待员，看起来工作很平常，可是，这也是革命工作，是为人民服务。我十几年一直为部队广大同志服务，为了方便住所家属学习毛主席著作，我给他们送毛主席著作、《毛主席语录》。为了给国家节约开支，招待所的被褥就自己拆洗。我还抽休息时间去拣墨水瓶、碎玻璃、牙膏皮等交公，为支援国家社会主义建设增添一分力量。有的同志看我年纪大了，怕我累着，劝我不要再干这些活，我说事情虽小，表达了我忠于毛主席的一片心，对“公”有利的事再小，我也要干，对“私”有利的事再大，也不能干。这才符合毛主席“大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干”的教导。
    部队领导非常关心我，怕累坏了我的身体，准备让我退休。当我想到白求恩同志的光辉事迹，想到世界上受压迫受剥削的人民还没有得到解放，就觉得身上有使不完的劲。我虽然年纪大了，身体有点残废，但我为人民服务的一颗心没有残废。经过再三请求，组织上终于同意我暂时不退休，我听了从心眼里高兴，我要永远为党工作。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为名为利的鬼话是一服大毒剂，千万不能上当。我们要坚决响应毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，做一个忠于毛泽东思想的共产党员。
