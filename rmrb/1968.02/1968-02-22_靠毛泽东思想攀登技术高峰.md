Climbing the Technical Peak with Mao Zedong Thought
	By a Platoon Leader, Chen Canglin

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has vigorously promoted the idea of "technology first." The counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing also barked: "Modern warfare is about steel, about technology, not about politics or bravery," and so on. Pfft! Revolutionary soldiers have the clearest hearts and the brightest eyes and will not believe their reactionary fallacies.

In recent years, our platoon has, in carrying out tasks such as war preparedness and road construction, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, push everything, transform everything, and achieve victory in all endeavors.

Our platoon once undertook the task of building a large bridge. According to the "experience" of capitalist countries and the operational procedures set by so-called "technical authorities," only fourth-level workers could work alone on the bridge, and the technical requirements were very complicated. If we followed this approach, at that time most of our comrades could only transport materials. At this time, two kinds of thinking emerged in the army: the majority believed that such a large project must fully mobilize the masses, and relying on a few people could not complete the task quickly, efficiently, and economically. We may not know the technology, but we can learn, and we can definitely work on the bridge. A few people, however, thought that we could not build such a big bridge and could only rely on technical workers to do it slowly. The Party branch believed that the former view was correct. Although we are a new platoon with new soldiers and no bridge-building technology, we have Mao Zedong Thought. Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest and most intelligent, and they are the greatest fighting force. We can definitely learn the operating technology while working and build the bridge.

"The Chinese people have the spirit and the ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Revolutionary soldiers are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. To build the bridge as quickly as possible, they are willing to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. If they don't know something, they learn it. Many comrades have low cultural levels and cannot read the part numbers of weldments or the structural diagrams of steel beams, so they use the method of drawing pictures and recording events, drawing in their notebooks and remembering in their hearts. The bridge-building team's soldiers work in mid-air; some comrades feel dizzy and nauseous as soon as they go up; sometimes the weather suddenly changes, with howling winds and pouring rain. However, everyone keeps Chairman Mao's teachings in mind, with red hearts and bold spirits, fearless of wind and rain, and fearless of any difficulties. In the triumphant song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we not only successfully completed a bridge with a world-class advanced level ahead of schedule but also trained a batch of warriors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's line of building the army.

Technology is mastered by people and is directed by politics. If a person's ideology is not firm, no matter how high their technology is, it is worthless. As long as one's mind is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, one is dedicated to the revolution and the people, fearless of hardship and death, even the most advanced technology can be mastered, and outsiders can quickly become insiders. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can not only climb the peak of ideological revolution but also climb the peak of world-class advanced technology. Let the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "technology first" go to hell!

    靠毛泽东思想攀登技术高峰
    某部指导员　陈苍林
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹“技术第一”。反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿也狂吠：现代战争“是打钢铁，打技术，而不是打政治，打勇敢”，等等。呸！革命战士心最明，眼最亮，绝不信他们这一套反动谬论。
    几年来，我们连队在执行战备修路等施工任务中，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，推动一切，改造一切，无往而不胜。
    我们连队曾担负修建一座大桥的任务。按照资本主义国家的“经验”和一些所谓“技术权威”制订的作业规章，四级工才能单独上桥作业，技术上的要求也很烦琐。如果照这一套办，当时全连大部分同志只能运料送料。这时，部队中产生了两种思想：大多数人认为，这样大的工程，必须充分发动群众，只靠少数人是不能多快好省地完成任务的，不懂技术我们可以学，我们一定能够上桥。个别人则认为，这样的大桥我们修不了，只能依靠技术工人慢慢来。党支部认为，前一种意见是正确的。虽然我们是新连队、新战士，没有架桥技术，但是我们有毛泽东思想。用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，最勇敢，最聪明，是最大的战斗力。我们完全可以边干边学，掌握操作技术，把大桥架起来。
    “中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”。革命战士最忠于毛主席，为了尽快架好桥，上刀山，下火海，在所不辞。不懂就学，许多同志文化水平低，看不懂焊件的型号和钢梁的结构图，就采取画图记事的办法，画在本上，记在心上。架桥组的战士悬空作业，有的同志一上去就头晕、目眩、呕吐；有时，突然天气发生变化，狂风吼叫，大雨倾盆。但是，大家把毛主席的教导记心头，心红胆壮，任凭风吹雨打，个个毫无惧色，什么困难都吓不倒。在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，我们不但成功地提前修好了一座具有世界先进水平的大桥，而且培养出了一批无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛主席建军路线的坚强战士。
    技术是由人来掌握的，是由政治来统帅的。一个人思想不过硬，技术再高也等于零。只要用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，一心为革命，一心为人民，一不怕苦，二不怕死，最精的技术也能学到手，外行就能很快变成内行。靠毛泽东思想，我们不仅能攀登思想革命化的高峰，而且能攀登世界先进技术的高峰。让中国赫鲁晓夫“技术第一”的谬论见鬼去吧！
