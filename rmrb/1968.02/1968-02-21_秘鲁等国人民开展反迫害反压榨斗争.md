In Latin America, where U.S. imperialism is deepening its oppression and intensifying its plunder, the broad masses of laboring people are continually rising up to oppose the political persecution and economic exploitation by U.S. imperialism and its agents.

In the Santiago de Chocan region of Peru, over 1,500 miners controlled by the U.S.-owned Northern Peru Mining Company at the Shouli and Kiruweika mines recently declared a general strike, demanding an increase in wages.

In Uruguay, 900 workers and their families from an Anglo-owned "Anglo" slaughterhouse and cold storage plant have been marching towards the capital, Montevideo, since the 16th, protesting against the capitalists' brutal exploitation and persecution of workers.

In Venezuela, public bus drivers in the oil city of Maracaibo recently went on strike, protesting the authorities' disregard for their work.
