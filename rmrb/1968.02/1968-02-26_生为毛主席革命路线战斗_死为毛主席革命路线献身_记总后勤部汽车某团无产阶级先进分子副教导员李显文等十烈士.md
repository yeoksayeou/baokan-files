In the march towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we are filled with excitement as we introduce the advanced proletarian elements who shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought—Vice Instructor Li Xianwen and ten other martyrs from the motorized unit of the General Logistics Department. They fought to shatter the provocations of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During a mission to transport supplies for military preparedness, they bravely battled a massive landslide and sacrificed their lives.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced proletarian elements and should be a vigorous vanguard organization capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in their struggle against the class enemy."

The ten martyrs were precisely such towering figures among the proletarian vanguard.

They fought year-round in the icy mountains and snowy peaks, seeking neither fame nor fortune, their hearts set solely on communism.

In the struggle to defend socialist China, when faced with the peril of flying rocks, they had a red sun in their hearts and dared to confront the crashing mountains and trembling earth.

They truly embodied the spirit of fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and sacrificing for it in death. With their lives, they composed a powerful anthem for the new era of Mao Zedong Thought!

A Red Sun in Their Hearts, Daring to Confront the Crashing Mountains

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, struck a blow at China's Khrushchev and pierced the hearts of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Last August, as hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians took up the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to strike at the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by China's Khrushchev, domestic and foreign reactionary forces were terrified and extremely hostile. They colluded to stir up an anti-China tide, attempting to disrupt this great revolutionary movement. The Indian reactionaries also repeatedly provoked us along the Sino-Indian border. At this critical moment, the 3rd Battalion, 11th and 12th Companies of the motorized unit were ordered to transport military supplies to the Tibetan border.

The soldiers and officers, who were loyal to Chairman Mao, regarded this mission to transport military supplies as a battle to shatter the provocations of domestic and foreign class enemies against our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. "The road is the battlefield to annihilate the enemy, and the driver's cabin is the post to defend Chairman Mao." They hung Chairman Mao's portrait upright in the driver's cabin and loudly recited Mao's teachings: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit; it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by them." With a fighting posture, they embarked on the windy and snowy highlands, covering thousands of miles.

On August 25, Vice Instructor Li Xianwen led the 12th Company convoy to the notorious danger zone on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway—the La Yue area. Here, one side of the road is adjacent to the Himalayan range's Palong Mountain, and the other side overlooks the Yarlung Zangbo River tributary, Dongqu River. Over a two-to-three-mile stretch, due to geological changes in Palong Mountain, rocks from the summit frequently tumble down onto the road at speeds of 20 to 30 meters per second, severely hindering vehicle passage.

When the 12th Company convoy arrived, the landslide area was shrouded in smoke, and a local vehicle was stuck, with rolling rocks pounding the roof of the driver's cabin. The situation was extremely dire. To rescue the vehicle, Deputy Company Commander Chen Hongguang led everyone to charge forward. Some levered, some pushed, some dug, and some carried. Just as they were working energetically, a major landslide occurred, and rocks from the mountain roared down. Everyone quickly retreated from the danger zone. When the falling rocks subsided slightly, the comrades charged forward again. Thus, they went in and out four times, and after more than an hour of fierce struggle, they finally rescued the vehicle.

The landslide continued. However, the highland motorized soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were fearless. Vice Instructor Li Xianwen stood in the most dangerous spot, loudly reciting Chairman Mao's teachings to inspire his comrades to clear the rubble and repair the road, forcing their way through the landslide area.

Just as the 12th Company convoy passed through, the rocks and mud that rolled down from the mountain blocked the road. The total relief truck led by Platoon Leader Qu Yue Lun and the subsequent 11th Company convoy, which had arrived, were unable to pass and were blocked at the eastern end of the landslide area.

Advance or retreat? Party Secretary and Company Commander Yang Xingchun immediately convened a meeting of the party branch committee on the spot and decided to organize everyone to clear the accumulated stones and force their way through the danger zone, even if they had to drive with lights on at night to reach the forward military depot. He mobilized the troops, saying: "Chairman Mao calls on us to 'grasp revolution and promote production, work, and military preparedness.' The earlier we pass through the danger zone and deliver the supplies, the more we respond to the great call of the supreme commander, Chairman Mao, and the more we defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with concrete actions."

A fierce battle against the severe landslide began. The entire company charged into the danger zone and fought against the constantly falling giant rocks. Tools were insufficient, so they used their hands to carry and their shoulders to bear. Safety guards distributed throughout the danger zone observed the rolling rocks on the mountain and issued warnings in time, allowing everyone to take cover. Deputy Instructor Cheng Defeng's left arm was injured by a rolling rock, but he continued to fight bravely. After five hours of struggle, in the face of the fearless heroic warriors, piles of accumulated stones yielded, and the flat road surface extended forward, one meter, ten meters, a hundred meters...

The landslide became more severe, and giant rocks tumbled down from the mountain at high speeds. The road surface, which had just been cleared, was blocked again. It was no longer possible to repair the road, and the safety of the convoy was threatened. At this critical moment, Comrade Yang Xingchun made a decisive decision on the spot and convened another emergency meeting of the party branch committee, firmly proposing that the convoy retreat to a safe area half a kilometer away. Some suggested retreating to the military depot fifteen kilometers away. Comrade Yang Xingchun immediately pointed out: "Retreat is for the sake of advance. Retreating to the military depot may have better living conditions, but it is not conducive to observing the danger and seizing the opportunity to pass through, completing the task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao."

Listen, what powerful language! Look, what a sublime spiritual realm! The loyal-hearted Comrade Yang Xingchun thought of the glorious task entrusted to him by Chairman Mao and saw the safety of his class brothers in the company. Later, it was proven that this crucial half kilometer avoided the sacrifice of the entire company and the loss of dozens of vehicles and military supplies.

The wheels stopped, but the hearts defending Chairman Mao did not stop beating for a single second!

The convoy retreated, but the determination to advance did not waver in the slightest!

The party branch, after discussion, decided that during the days of obstruction, they would, on the one hand, investigate the danger and actively create conditions to pass through, and on the other hand, organize the troops to criticize China's Khrushchev's "philosophy of survival." At this time, the news of the Indian reactionaries provoking trouble on the border ignited the righteous indignation of the officers and soldiers. Their hearts flew to the border. Every day, many comrades voluntarily ventured into the danger zone to investigate the situation. Platoon Leader Qu Yue Lun, looking at the blocked road, thinking of the needs of the comrades in the company ahead, said to the soldiers: "The road can be cut off, but the determination to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao cannot change! If the car cannot pass, we will carry the relief materials on our backs." Comrade Yang Xingchun feared that the soldiers might encounter danger and gave them many "orders," forbidding them to go to the danger zone. But he himself, to understand the pattern of the landslide and find the opportunity for the convoy to pass, went into the danger zone three or four times a day. Rolling giant rocks flew over their heads and fell into the Dongqu River, splashing water columns several meters high, but they paid no attention and continued to observe the geological changes carefully. Comrade Yang Xingchun had the deputy company commander keep time, and he calculated the number of falling rocks and the time and intervals of each landslide, recording them in detail. When the landslide was severe, some comrades advised him: "Company Commander, it's too dangerous, you shouldn't go." He replied: "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger?' If we don't master the pattern of the landslide, how can the convoy pass through?"

Just as the 11th Company was tensely investigating the danger zone, the 12th Company convoy, led by Vice Instructor Li Xianwen, was blocked at the western end of the danger zone on their way back after completing their mission.

Two companies, one unable to advance, the other unable to retreat. Li Xianwen was extremely anxious: the military preparedness transport mission entrusted by the party had not been completed due to the landslide; what was the situation of the 11th Company after being blocked... He decided to enter the danger zone to investigate the road and study the method of passage.

On the 29th, the landslide became more severe, and the danger continued to expand. At this dangerous moment, Li Xianwen entered the danger zone. He instructed the accompanying driver to stay with the vehicle in the safe area and said, "You observe the falling rocks on the mountain for me," then went alone into the landslide area. At this time, the rocks from Palong Mountain were falling like a barrage, and the driver shouted, "Vice Instructor, turn back! Vice Instructor, turn back!" Only to see him wave his hand and continue forward. At this time, Palong Mountain was shrouded in smoke, and the roar was deafening. The road filled with giant rocks could not be passed, so he climbed over the suspension bridge and continued along the small path on the opposite bank of the river. Not far ahead, he met a few road workers returning to their living quarters. He said with concern, "You rest in a safe place for a while, and when I return, we'll go together by car." In front of a steep cliff, a comrade from a brother unit advised him, "Comrade, don't go any further, it's too dangerous over there!" He earnestly replied, "I can't, there's still one of our companies over there!" Knowing the mountain had tigers, he still went towards the tiger's den. Only to see Comrade Li Xianwen, with sweat on his forehead and dust all over his body, facing the brilliant sunlight, taking firm steps, disappearing in the center of the danger zone shrouded in smoke and dust.

That morning, Yang Xingchun learned that Vice Instructor Li had gone to the danger zone and decided, along with Deputy Instructor Cheng Defeng, Platoon Leader Qu Yue Lun, and the deputy company commander and deputy instructor of the 12th Company, Chen Hongguang and Tan Rengui, who had walked through from the west end the previous day, to go to the danger zone to inspect the road with Vice Instructor Li and jointly study the method of passage. Communist Party member and squad leader Yang Qingzhong and Li Rongchang, and Young Pioneer members and new soldiers Chen Changyuan and Li Xingfu, after learning of this, also insisted on going. Comrade Yang Xingchun looked at these vigorous soldiers and nodded with a smile. Thus, the nine comrades entered the danger zone from the east end together.

Just as Li Xianwen, Yang Xingchun, and the other ten comrades were bravely advancing on the slopes of the danger zone, the greatest landslide in the history of the Sichuan-Tibet Highway erupted! A deafening roar, Palong Mountain, from a height of seven hundred meters, collapsed in a vast, earth-shattering manner. Giant rocks the size of houses, along with tall ancient trees, all rushed towards the opposite bank of the river, engulfing the road and cutting off the river flow...

Chairman Mao's good soldiers, our close comrades, bravely sacrificed their precious lives to defend Chairman Mao and shatter the provocations of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

Let us forever remember their names. They are:

Vice Instructor Li Xianwen, a Communist Party member, first-class merit awardee, and active learner of Chairman Mao's works;

Company Commander Yang Xingchun, a Communist Party member, first-class merit awardee, and active learner of Chairman Mao's works;

Deputy Company Commander Chen Hongguang, a Communist Party member, first-class merit awardee;

Platoon Leader Qu Yue Lun, a Communist Party member, first-class merit awardee, and active learner of Chairman Mao's works;

Squad Leader Yang Qingzhong, a Communist Party member, first-class merit awardee, five-good soldier, and active learner of Chairman Mao's works;

Deputy Instructor Cheng Defeng, a Communist Party member, second-class merit awardee;

Deputy Instructor Tan Rengui, a Communist Party member, second-class merit awardee, and active learner of Chairman Mao's works;

Squad Leader Li Rongchang, a Communist Party member, second-class merit awardee, five-good soldier, and active learner of Chairman Mao's works;

Soldier Chen Changyuan, a Young Pioneer member, second-class merit awardee;

Soldier Li Xingfu, a Young Pioneer member, second-class merit awardee.

The international lament sings a sorrowful tune, and the storm falls from the sky for us. Advanced proletarian element Qu Yue Lun once wrote in his notes on studying Chairman Mao's works: "Death, for those individualists and cowards who fear death, is terrifying; but for us proletarian revolutionary soldiers, it is fearless. In peacetime, I want to be like Zhang Side and Lei Feng, a faithful servant of the people; in wartime, I want to be like Liu Huilan, Huang Jiguang, and Dong Cunrui, a heroic son of the people; in saving others, I want to be like Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, and Cai Yongxiang, willing to die myself to save others!" The heroes' glorious images will forever live in our hearts, and the heroes' communist spirit will forever inspire us to follow the great leader Chairman Mao closely and fight to build a new world of red!

The Wheels Roll Along Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

The ten martyrs who sacrificed their lives to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line were, in their lifetime, loyal soldiers fighting to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The heroes who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao had the deepest feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, studied his books the best, and defended his revolutionary line the most resolutely. Whether in the vast snow-covered grasslands or in the military depots on the roof of the world; whether in urgent military preparedness transport or in the arduous task of vehicle maintenance, no matter how harsh the environment, how heavy the tasks, or how tight the time, they always regarded studying Chairman Mao's works as the most important matter and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide every minute of their lives. They said: "Without Mao Zedong Thought, we would be out of the revolutionary ranks."

The motorized unit deals with technology every day, and the focus is on whether to emphasize people or things, whether to emphasize politics or technology. This is the focal point of the struggle between the two military lines. The martyrs resolutely implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to emphasize politics, firmly grasping the use of Mao Zedong Thought to transform people and promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, which is the core of the core, the soul of the soul, and the essence of the essence. They advanced unshakably along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Yang Xingchun, known as the "political company commander" by the soldiers, insisted on leading the troops with Mao Zedong Thought in all work. He summarized the experience of "one walk and three vehicles," that is, walking the path indicated by Chairman Mao, driving the revolutionary vehicle, political vehicle, and ideological vehicle. He used the money he had saved over the years to buy a transistor radio. He said: "We are stationed in the highlands all year round and must often hear Chairman Mao's voice to avoid getting lost." Deputy Instructor Tan Rengui, when serving as a driving instructor, used politics to guide technology and inspired the students to drive with Mao Zedong Thought. Every time they passed a dangerous section, he would loudly recite Chairman Mao's quotations to inspire the students to overcome difficulties. He said: "The more tasks there are, the more complex the situation, the more we need to emphasize politics." Squad Leader Yang Qingzhong, who was continuously rated as a five-good soldier for seven years, always emphasized politics and cherished every vehicle part with deep feelings, carefully maintaining the vehicle to keep it in good technical condition and completing the transport tasks excellently. He said: "To keep the vehicle from breaking down, first keep people's thoughts from breaking down."

Vice Instructor Li Xianwen was a model who emphasized proletarian politics in everything.

During a preliminary evaluation of the "four goods," there was a saying, "If a vehicle has an accident, the 'four goods' will be blown away." Comrade Li Xianwen believed: accidents should be analyzed concretely. One cannot only look at technology and safety but ignore politics. At the company party committee meeting to discuss the preliminary evaluation of the "four goods," he proposed: "We must prevent the erroneous tendency of pure militarism. To measure whether a unit is 'four good,' we should mainly look at how politics is emphasized, how the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works are implemented, and how the spiritual outlook of the people is." After a discussion, everyone reached a consensus. This preliminary evaluation gave the entire company a profound education on emphasizing politics, making the "four goods" movement advance in the correct direction.

Comrade Li Xianwen remembered Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the guiding force and the soul. In his work, he always addressed the living thoughts of the soldiers, insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the troops and promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. He saw that some drivers, after refueling at the gas station, would also draw the oil from the hose into the oil tank. He felt that there was a struggle between "public" and "private" in this and patiently explained to everyone: "Drawing the hose, although your own oil tank has a little more oil, you have drawn in the 'private' character. Relying on the convenience of the state to improve your own 'fuel-saving' figures, the more honor you get, the heavier your 'private' heart becomes." These few words left a deep impression on the comrades. After that, you would never see the soldiers of the company drawing the hose at the gas station. Soldier Ye Yuanxing drove proactively and did a good job, and Comrade Li Xianwen asked him, "Why do you drive proactively?" Ye Yuanxing replied, "This is the good style that a driver should have." Comrade Li Xianwen asked him, "What else?" Ye Yuanxing thought for a moment and replied, "For safety." Comrade Li Xianwen patiently guided him, "You are right, but you haven't gotten to the root of the matter. Didn't Chairman Mao teach us to 'selflessly serve the people'?" Comrade Li Xianwen was like this, leading the soldiers step by step, instilling Mao Zedong Thought drop by drop into their hearts.

The motorized unit often drives on the windy and snowy highlands, far from leadership, and highly dispersed. To let Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position, to make the entire company have a unified thought, a unified will, and a unified action, Comrade Li Xianwen thought of studying the rules of grasping living thoughts according to the situation of the motorized unit, suggested that the party branch committee specially study this, and personally went to the first platoon to gain practical experience. Together with Platoon Leader Qu Yue Lun, they summarized the experience of using Chairman Mao's quotations to answer the "fifty-one hows," helping the entire company's comrades to skillfully use them.

Once, the convoy had to cross Damala Mountain, and Platoon Leader Qu Yue Lun gathered the entire platoon for roll call.

He asked, "How do we deal with the high and dangerous road on Damala Mountain?"

Everyone answered, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Decide the work policy according to the actual situation.'"

He asked again, "What if the vehicle breaks down and falls behind?"

The answer was, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We need a passionate but calm mood, tense but orderly work.'"

He asked again, "What if we need to maintain the vehicle at the forward military depot?"

The answer was, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Promote the spirit of bravery in battle, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous battle (that is, fighting continuously without rest for a short period).'"

Following this, Comrade Qu Yue Lun briefly made a few requirements, and the roll call ended. That day, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the convoy successfully passed through Damala Mountain.

Firmly walking the path of emphasizing politics is walking the path of revolution, the path of light, and the path of victory. The martyrs held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and walked the glorious path of their fighting career. The unit is determined to follow the example of the martyrs, never forgetting to emphasize proletarian politics, and let the rolling wheels forever follow the path indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao.

"The Communist Party is not about seeking office, but about revolution"

Among the ten martyrs, six were cadres. They fought alongside the soldiers in defending national defense and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, year after year, battling in the windy and snowy highlands and steep mountains, until their last breath.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office, but revolution. We must all have a thorough revolutionary spirit and never, even for a moment, separate ourselves from the masses."

A cadre, is it about seeking office and becoming a lord, gradually turning into a revisionist, or is it about following Chairman Mao's revolution to the end, preserving revolutionary youth forever? The cadres among the ten martyrs answered this question with their glorious actions.

Take Company Commander Yang Xingchun, for example. He was most opposed to giving orders and becoming a lord. He had a catchphrase: "Whatever is to be done by others, I will do it first." In the most difficult times, he was always brave and resolute, taking the lead and working in front, showing the noble revolutionary qualities of a Communist.

Last February, the convoy arrived at Ranwu Gorge. Here, it had been snowing for days, and the accumulated snow on the high mountains was blown down by the strong wind onto the road, forming a snow wall nearly a hundred meters long and four to five meters high. The road workers said, "It will take two or three days to clear the road." Facing the difficulty, Comrade Yang Xingchun, with his model actions, issued a silent order to his comrades. He picked up a large round shovel and loudly recited, "Make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He led everyone to fight against the wind and snow. A gust of wind blew down the accumulated snow from the mountain top, and Comrade Yang Xingchun, while taking care of the soldiers to avoid the danger, was himself knocked down by the heavy snow. The soldiers pulled him out from the snow pile. After fighting until dark, they finally dug out a snow lane. In the swirling snowflakes, he directed the convoy, vehicle by vehicle, to advance.

"That's where the most dangerous place is, and that's where our company commander is!" This is the high evaluation of the soldiers of the 11th Company of Comrade Yang Xingchun's thorough revolutionary spirit, not caring about life and death.

When driving on the highlands, every time they encountered landslides, avalanches, or glaciers, Comrade Yang Xingchun was always fearless and took the lead, standing at the forefront of the struggle. Once, the convoy arrived at the famous "Ancient Glacier" on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, and they had to cross a makeshift bridge made of four round logs. Some new drivers, seeing the surging torrent, felt a bit tense. Comrade Yang Xingchun, facing this situation, thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "There is no difficulty that can stop people from advancing," and immediately jumped into the driver's cabin, calmly driving the first vehicle across the bridge. After that, he directed the vehicles, one by one, to pass through. When the 82nd vehicle slipped down due to the round logs being soaked by water, at this critical moment when the vehicle might fall into the rapid current, Comrade Yang Xingchun loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings, and was the first to jump into the bone-chilling snow water, leading everyone to pull and push the vehicle back onto the shore.

The infinitely loyal Communist Party member Yang Xingchun's thorough revolutionary spirit was also shown in his never, even for a moment, separating himself from the masses. His family lived near the barracks, but on holidays, he thought not of going home but of going deep into the platoons and squads, talking with the soldiers, and seeking their opinions. He couldn't sing well, but when the unit sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, he always insisted on conducting. Every time the company held an evening party, he was always there with his performance. The soldiers said with deep affection, "Our company commander has no airs, eats with us, sleeps in the same bunk, rolls in the mud with us in the wind and rain, and is our confidant."

Comrade Li Xianwen was also such a person. Although he was a leading cadre of the battalion, he had no airs and was always with the masses. He followed the convoy and insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers. When he arrived at the military depot, he always ate the same food as the comrades and slept in the same bunk with the soldiers. Day after day, trip after trip, he also proposed to the party branch committee that cadres at all levels and soldiers should "study together, drive together, eat together, and sleep together." After four discussions, a consensus was reached, and the party branch made a decision. This "four together" strengthened the relationship between superiors and subordinates and greatly promoted the revolutionary transformation of the company's thinking.

Ascending the "Public" Peak of Communism

Vice Chairman Lin said, "To consolidate the socialist system, both economically and politically, we must advocate the concept of 'publicness,' that is, to create new people to build a new society, to create people with communist spirits." The ten martyrs were precisely such a group of selfless communist warriors. Their glorious lives were a lifetime of ascending the "public" peak of communism.

At the summit of Qia'er Mountain at an altitude of 5,000 meters, on the icy and muddy grasslands, and by the steep cliffs of dangerous roads, when their comrades' vehicles broke down, Squad Leader Li Rongchang always ignored hunger and cold, sometimes staying up all night, helping his comrades fix them.

In the hospital, there was a critically ill patient who needed a blood transfusion, and Comrade Yang Xingchun, who was not in good health, voluntarily offered to donate blood, saving the life of a class brother.

The company's kitchen needed people, and the new soldier Chen Changyuan, who had only been enlisted for two days, gave up the opportunity to learn to drive and voluntarily requested to work in the kitchen.

The heroic ten martyrs had only Chairman Mao, only the revolution, only the people in their hearts, and nothing but themselves. Communist Party member and Platoon Leader Qu Yue Lun wrote in his diary: "A Communist Party member, for the interests of the people, thinking of the communist cause, how can one not be fearless of death?"

On the treacherous Damala Mountain, the second platoon's vehicle slid to the edge of a several-hundred-meter-high cliff, with the front wheels hanging in the air and the vehicle body tilted, in a very dangerous situation. Comrade Qu Yue Lun rushed forward, calmly climbed into the driver's cabin, and drove the vehicle out of danger. During a military training session, a new soldier, due to excessive tension, threw a hand grenade only five or six meters away from the crowd. At this critical moment, Comrade Qu Yue Lun bravely rushed forward, quickly picked up the hand grenade, and threw it away, avoiding a possible casualty.

Comrade Qu Yue Lun's selfless communist spirit will forever remain in the hearts of his comrades. In the company, when they talked about Comrade Qu, everyone praised him as a "selflessly serving the people" person, and people could tell his stories of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people endlessly. Just take his story of "one alarm clock," for example. After becoming a platoon leader, he specially bought an alarm clock with a night light. At home, he placed it on the windowsill, and on the road, he hung it on the windshield of the vehicle's driver's cabin, so that the comrades in the company could see it day and night. Some comrades asked him, "Platoon Leader, the alarm clock is so big, neither good-looking nor easy to carry, why don't you buy a watch?" He said, "The alarm clock, although not as good-looking as a watch, can be used by everyone, but a watch can only be used by one person." It was in this urgent military preparedness transport mission that Comrade Qu Yue Lun led the company's total relief truck. The 6th Company of a brother unit had five vehicles, which also set out with the 12th Company, and he voluntarily let the 6th Company's vehicles go first, taking on the relief mission of the 6th Company's vehicles. He told the drivers and mechanics on the relief truck: "This way, others have a support, and their hearts are also at ease. We have more people and vehicles, and we should actively think of others' difficulties." When the 6th Company's vehicle broke down, he voluntarily went forward to repair it. One day, a vehicle of the 6th Company had a major part broken and needed a relatively long time to repair. He was afraid that the 6th Company's comrades would not have food to eat, so he told the driver of this vehicle: "You can drive my vehicle first, and I will come after it is repaired." He endured the highland autumn night's cold wind and hunger, fighting until late at night.

The ten martyrs are shining examples that emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the new stage of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and are new communists who grew up in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought. They truly embodied the spirit of fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and sacrificing for it in death.

Our party, with such advanced elements, will surely be full of vigor and vitality and will surely be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to victoriously carry out the great revolutionary struggle!

Our army, with such advanced elements, will have the greatest fighting power and will be invincible and unstoppable in the face of any powerful enemy!

Our country, with such advanced elements, will be able to ensure that our proletarian dictatorship's ironclad fortress will never change color for thousands of years and will forever follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, striding towards the brilliant future of communism.

    生为毛主席革命路线战斗  死为毛主席革命路线献身
    ——记总后勤部汽车某团无产阶级先进分子副教导员李显文等十烈士
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军号中，我们怀着激动的心情，介绍闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级先进分子——总后勤部汽车某团副教导员李显文等十烈士。他们为粉碎帝、修、反的挑衅，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，在一次执行战备运输任务中，与特大山崩顽强搏斗，壮烈牺牲。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”
    十烈士正是这样的顶天立地的无产阶级先进分子。
    他们，常年战斗在冰山雪岭，不为名，不为利，一心只想共产主义；
    他们，在保卫社会主义祖国的斗争中，面临飞石滚滚的生死关头，心中有个红太阳，山崩地裂也敢上；
    他们真正做到了：生为毛主席革命路线战斗，死为毛主席革命路线献身。他们用自己的生命，谱出了毛泽东思想新时代进行曲的一个最强音！
    心中有个红太阳　山崩地裂也敢上
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，打在中国赫鲁晓夫身上，痛在帝、修、反心上。去年八月，正当亿万军民奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，直捣以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的时候，国内外反动势力万分恐惧，极端仇视，互相勾结，掀起一股反华逆流，妄图破坏这场伟大的革命运动。印度反动派也多次在中印边境向我挑衅。就在这个时候，汽车某团三营十一连和十二连，奉命运送战备物资去西藏边防。
    无限忠于毛主席的指战员们，把这次战备运输任务，当作粉碎国内外阶级敌人向我国无产阶级文化大革命挑衅的一场战斗。“公路就是消灭敌人的战场，驾驶室就是保卫毛主席的战斗岗位。”他们把毛主席像端端正正地挂在驾驶室里，高声朗读着毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”以战斗的姿态，踏上了风雪高原万里征途。
    八月二十五日，副教导员李显文同志率领的十二连车队，来到川藏公路著名险区——拉月。这里的公路，一边靠喜马拉雅山脉的帕龙山，一边临雅鲁藏布江支流东久河。在两、三里的地段上，由于帕龙山地质变化，山顶飞石经常以每秒钟二、三十米的速度，倾泻到公路上，严重地影响车辆通行。
    十二连车队来到这里时，塌方区山上烟雾沉沉，一台地方车被乱石卡住，滚滚的飞石，砸得驾驶室顶篷崩崩响，情况十分危急。为了抢救这台车，副连长陈洪光带着大家冲了上去。撬的撬，推的推，挖的挖，搬的搬。正干得起劲，大塌方又爆发了，山上的石头咆哮着直往下坠落。大家迅速撤出险区。等飞石稍稍平静，同志们又冲了上去。就这样四进四出，经过一个多小时苦战，终于把这台车救了出来。
    塌方仍在继续。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的高原汽车兵，无所畏惧。副教导员李显文站在最危险的地方，高声地朗读着毛主席的教导，鼓舞着同志们排除乱石，修通道路，强行通过了塌方区。
    十二连车队刚刚通过，山上滚下来的乱石和泥浆，就把公路堵塞了。一排长曲月伦带的总救济车和随后赶到的十一连车队，已无法通过，被阻在塌方区东端。
    前进，还是后退？十一连党支部书记、连长杨星春就地召开了支委会，决定立即组织大家清除积石，强行通过险区，晚上拉灯也要赶到前方兵站。他对部队动员说：“毛主席他老人家号召我们‘抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备’。我们早一分钟通过险区，把物资运上去，就是响应最高统帅毛主席的伟大号召，就是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的具体行动。”
    一场和严重塌方的激烈战斗开始了。全连同志冲进险区，和不断飞落的巨石展开搏斗。工具不够，就用手搬，用肩扛。分布在险区的安全哨，观察着山上滚动的飞石，不时发出警号，让大家躲避。副指导员程德凤的左臂，被一块飞滚的石头打伤了，仍继续坚持战斗。经过五个小时奋战，在大无畏的英雄战士面前，一堆堆的积石让了路，平平的路面，一米，十米，百米……不断向前伸延。
    塌方越来越严重，巨石飞速地从山上倾泻下来。刚刚修通的路面又重新被堵塞。修路已无法进行，车队的安全受到了威胁。在这紧要时刻，杨星春同志当机立断，在现场又一次召开了紧急支委会，果断地提出车队后撤到一公里半的安全地带。有人主张撤到离险区十五公里的兵站。杨星春同志立即指出：“退是为了进。撤到兵站，生活条件虽然好些，但是不利于观察险情，不利于随时寻机通过，完成毛主席交给我们的任务。”
    听，多么铿锵有力的语言！看，多么崇高的精神境界！赤胆忠心的杨星春同志，心里想到的是毛主席交给自己的光荣任务，眼里看到的是全连阶级兄弟的生命安全。后来证明，就是这关键的一公里半，避免了全连同志的牺牲，避免了几十辆车和战备物资的损失。
    车轮停止了转动，保卫毛主席的红心一分一秒没有停止跳动！
    车队后撤了，前进的决心一丝一毫没有动摇！
    党支部经过研究，决定在受阻的时日，一面摸清险情，积极创造条件通过，一面组织部队批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”。这时，印度反动派在边疆寻衅的消息，激起了干部战士的万丈怒火。他们的心飞到了边防。每天总有不少同志自动深入险区探察情况。一排长曲月伦，望着被阻的公路，想着前面连里同志们的需要，对战士们说：“公路可断，走毛主席指引的道路的决心不能变！车子过不去，我们就是背，也要把救济材料背过去。”杨星春同志怕战士发生意外，给大家下了许多“命令”，不准去险区。而他自己呢，为了摸清塌方的规律，寻找车队通过的时机，却每天都要和干部们深入险区三、四次。滚滚的巨石，飞过他们的头顶，落到东久河里，溅起一两丈高的水柱，他们毫不在意，仍然聚精会神地仔细观察地质变化的情况。杨星春让副连长看着表，他计算着飞石的数量和每次塌方的时间和间隔，详细地记录下来。塌方严重的时候有的同志劝他说：“连长，那么危险，你不要去了。”他回答说：“毛主席教导我们，不入虎穴，焉得虎子，不掌握塌方规律，车队怎么能过去。”
    就在十一连紧张地探察险区的时候，由副教导员李显文带领的十二连车队，在完成任务后，返回途中被阻在险区西端。
    两个连队，一个上不来，一个下不去。李显文焦急万分：党交给的战备运输任务，因为塌方，还没有完成；十一连受阻后，连队的情况怎么样？……他决定进入险区，探察道路，研究通过的办法。
    二十九日，塌方更严重了，险情也不断扩大。在这危险的时刻，李显文来到险区。他嘱咐同行的驾驶员连同车子留在安全地带，说了声“你替我观察山上的飞石”，便一个人进入塌方地段。这时，山上的飞石连珠炮似的往下飞滚，驾驶员大声呼唤：“副教导员快转来！副教导员快转来！”只见他回过头来摆了摆手，一直向前走去。这时帕龙山烟雾迷漫，吼声震天。堆满巨石的公路不能通过了，他攀过索桥，从河对岸的小路继续前进。走不多远，迎面碰到几名修路工人要回住地。他关切地说：“你们到安全地方歇一会，等我转来，一起坐车走。”在一块陡壁前，一位兄弟部队的同志劝他说：“同志，不要过去了，那边太危险！”他恳切地回答：“不行啊，那边还有我们一个连！”明知山有虎，偏向虎山行。只见李显文同志头上冒着汗水，浑身都是尘土，迎着灿烂的阳光，迈着坚定的步伐，消失在烟尘滚滚的险区中心。
    这天上午，杨星春得知李副教导员已去险区，就决定和副指导员程德凤、排长曲月伦以及前一天从西端步行闯过来的十二连副连长陈洪光、副指导员谭仁贵，到险区和副教导员一起勘察道路，共同研究通过的办法。共产党员、班长杨庆忠和李荣昌，共青团员、新战士陈昌元和李兴富知道以后，也坚决要去。杨星春同志望着这几个生龙活虎般的战士，微笑着点了点头。于是，他们九个同志从东端一起进入了险区。
    正当李显文、杨星春等十个同志，分别在险区的山坡上顽强地前进时，川藏公路有史以来的特大山崩爆发了！一阵惊天动地的巨响，帕龙山从七百米的高处，铺天盖地的倒塌下来，屋大的巨石，卷着高大的古树一齐向河对岸的大山猛扑过去，吞没了公路，压断了河流……
    毛主席的好战士，我们的亲密战友，为了保卫毛主席，粉碎帝、修、反的挑衅，英勇地献出了自己宝贵的生命。
    让我们永远记住他们的名字吧。他们是：
    共产党员、一等功、学习毛主席著作积极分子、副教导员李显文；
    共产党员、一等功、学习毛主席著作积极分子、连长杨星春；
    共产党员、一等功、副连长陈洪光；
    共产党员、一等功、学习毛主席著作积极分子、排长曲月伦；
    共产党员、一等功、学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士、班长杨庆忠；
    共产党员、二等功、副指导员程德凤；
    共产党员、二等功、学习毛主席著作积极分子、副指导员谭仁贵；
    共产党员、二等功、学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士、班长李荣昌；
    共青团员、二等功、战士陈昌元；
    共青团员、二等功、战士李兴富。
    国际悲歌歌一曲，狂飙为我从天落。无产阶级先进分子曲月伦同志生前，在一篇学习毛主席著作的笔记中写道：“死，对于那些个人主义者，和贪生怕死的胆小鬼来说，是可怕的；但对于我们无产阶级革命战士来说，却是无所畏惧的。在平时，我要象张思德、雷锋那样，做一个人民的忠实勤务员；在战时，我要象刘胡兰、黄继光、董存瑞那样，做一个人民的英雄儿子；在舍己救人时，我要象欧阳海、王杰、蔡永祥那样，宁愿自己死，换来他人活！”英雄们光辉的形象，永远活在我们心中，英雄们的共产主义精神，永远鼓舞着我们紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，为建设一个红彤彤的新世界而战斗！
    车轮沿着毛主席的革命路线飞奔
    为捍卫毛主席革命路线英勇献身的十烈士，他们生前，都是为捍卫毛主席革命路线而战斗的忠诚战士。
    无限忠于毛主席的英雄们，对伟大统帅毛主席感情最深，毛主席的书学得最好，捍卫毛主席革命路线最坚决。无论在茫茫的风雪草原，还是在世界屋脊的兵站；无论是紧急的战备运输，还是繁重的整车工作，环境再苦，任务再重，时间再紧，他们总是把学习毛主席著作当作头等重要大事，用毛泽东思想统帅自己生命的每一分钟。他们说：“离开了毛泽东思想，就是离开了革命的行列。”
    汽车部队整天和技术打交道，是突出人，还是突出物，是突出政治，还是突出技术，是两条建军路线斗争的焦点。烈士们坚决贯彻林副主席突出政治的指示，紧紧抓住用毛泽东思想改造人，促进人的思想革命化这个政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心，坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的道路前进。
    被战士们誉为“政治连长”的杨星春，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想带领部队，他总结出了“一走三车”的经验，即：走毛主席指引的路，开革命车、政治车、思想车。他把平时积下来的钱，买来了一台半导体收音机。他说：“我们常年在高原执勤，就是要经常听到毛主席的声音，才不会迷失方向。”副指导员谭仁贵，在担任驾驶教练时，用政治统帅技术，鼓舞学员用毛泽东思想开车。每当通过危险地段，他总是高声朗读毛主席语录，鼓舞学员去战胜困难。他说：“越是任务繁重，情况复杂，就越要突出政治。”连续七年评为五好战士的班长杨庆忠一贯突出政治，对每个汽车零件都倾注着深厚的感情，精心维护，使车子经常保持良好的技术状态，出色地完成了运输任务。他说：“要车子不抛锚，首先要人的思想不抛锚。”
    副教导员李显文，更是处处、事事突出无产阶级政治的模范。
    在一次四好初评时，有一种“车辆出事故，四好一风吹”的论调。李显文同志认为：对事故要作具体分析。不能只看技术、只看安全，不看政治。在研究四好初评的营党委会上，他提出：“必须防止单纯军事观点的错误倾向。衡量一个单位够不够四好，主要看突出政治怎么样，看活学活用毛主席著作落实得怎么样，看人的精神面貌怎么样。”经过一番讨论，大家统一了认识。这次初评，全营上上下下都受到了一次深刻的突出政治的教育，使四好运动沿着正确的方向前进。
    李显文同志牢记毛主席的教导，政治是统帅，是灵魂。在工作中，他始终针对战士活思想，坚持用毛泽东思想教育部队，促进人的思想革命化。他看到有的驾驶员到加油站加完油，还要把皮管里的油理到油箱里。他觉得这里面有“公”和“私”的斗争，就耐心地对大家讲：“理油管，自己的油箱里虽然增加了点油，但却理进了‘私’字。靠占国家的便宜来提高自己‘节约’汽油的数字，得到的荣誉越多，‘私’心也就越重。”短短的几句话，给同志们留下了深刻的印象。以后，加油站里就再也看不到连队战士理油管的现象了。战士叶远兴开车时主动让车做得比较好，李显文同志问他“为什么要主动让车？”叶远兴回答说：“这是驾驶员应有的好作风。”李显文又问他：“还有呢？”叶远兴想了想，回答说：“为了安全。”“这是讲礼貌。”李显文同志耐心地启发他说：“你说的都对，但没有说到根本上。毛主席不是教导我们要‘毫不利己专门利人’吗？”李显文同志就是这样循循善诱，把毛泽东思想一点一滴地灌输到战士的心坎里。
    汽车部队常年奔驶在风雪高原，远离领导，高度分散，为了让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，使全连人员，有统一的思想，统一的意志，统一的行动，李显文想到要针对汽车部队的情况，摸索一套抓活思想的规律，建议支委会专门进行了研究，并亲自到一排蹲点，和排长曲月伦一起在实践中摸索，总结出了用毛主席语录回答的“五十一个怎么办？”帮助全连同志熟练地运用。
    有一次车队要过达马拉山，排长曲月伦同志集合全排点名。
    他问：“过达马拉山，山高路险怎么办？”
    大家回答：“毛主席教导我们：‘按照实际情况决定工作方针’。”
    又问：“抛锚掉了队怎么办？”
    答：“毛主席教导说：‘我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情绪，紧张而有秩序的工作。’”
    再问：“到前方兵站要整车怎么办？”
    答：“毛主席教导我们：‘发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。’”……
    接着，曲月伦同志简短地提了几点要求，点名就结束了。这天，车队在毛泽东思想指挥下，顺利地通过了达马拉山。
    坚定地走突出政治的路，就是走革命的路，光明的路，胜利的路。烈士们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着这条光辉的道路走完了自己的战斗历程。这个部队决心象烈士们那样，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，让飞驶的车轮永远沿着伟大统帅毛主席指引的道路前进。
    “共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”
    十烈士中，有六位是干部。他们在保卫国防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的战斗中，和战士们一起，常年累月，奋战在风雪高原，崇山峻岭，直到生命的最后一秒钟。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”
    一个干部，是做官当老爷，逐步演变成修正主义，还是紧跟毛主席革命到底，永葆革命青春？十烈士中的干部们，以自己光辉的行动，作了肯定的回答。
    就说连长杨星春吧。他生前最反对指手划脚，做官当老爷，他有一句口头禅：“凡是要别人干的，自己就先动手。”在最困难的时刻，他总是勇敢坚定，抢在先，干在前，表现了共产党人崇高的革命品质。
    去年二月，车队来到然乌沟。这里连日大雪，高山上的积雪被狂风刮得崩落在公路上，堆起了一道长近百米、高四五米的雪墙。修路工人说：“要两三天才能通车。”在困难面前，杨星春同志以自己的模范行动，给战友们下达了无声命令。他拿起一把大圆锹高声朗诵着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”带领着大家和风雪展开了一场激战。一阵狂风，山顶上的积雪崩落下来，杨星春只顾招呼战士躲避，自己却被大雪压倒在地，战士们把他从雪堆里拉出来。奋战到天黑，终于挖出了一条雪胡同。在纷纷的鹅毛大雪中，他指挥着车队，一辆辆地前进。
    “那里最危险，那里就有我们连长！”这是十一连战士对杨星春同志一心为革命，生死全不顾的彻底革命精神的高度评价。
    在高原行车，每当遇到塌方、雪崩、冰川的时候，杨星春总是临危不惧，挺身而出，站在斗争最前面。一次，车队来到川藏公路著名的“古色冰川”，要通过一座四根圆木搭成的便桥。有的新驾驶员看到汹涌的激流，心情有些紧张。杨星春面对这种情景，想起了毛主席“没有什么困难可以阻碍人的前进”的教导，随即跳进驾驶室，沉着地把第一辆车开过了便桥。尔后，他指挥着车辆一辆辆地通过。当八十二号车因为圆木被水打湿，不慎前轮滑了下去。在这辆车可能掉进急流的关键时刻，杨星春高声朗诵着毛主席的教导，第一个跳进浸骨的雪水，带着大家连拉带推，把车拖上了岸。
    无限忠于毛主席的共产党员杨星春，彻底的革命精神还表现在他一时一刻不脱离群众。他家属住处离营房不远，到了假日，他想到的不是回家，而是深入班排，和战士们谈心，征求意见。他不大会唱歌，可部队唱毛主席语录歌，他总是要抢着指挥，每次连里开晚会，也少不了他的节目。战士们深情地说：“我们连长一点架子也没有，和我们吃一锅饭，睡一个通铺，风里雨里和大家一起滚泥巴，是我们战士的贴心人。”
    李显文同志也是这样一个人。他虽然是营的领导干部，可是他没有一点架子，始终和群众在一起。他跟车队出发，坚持和战士在一起学习毛主席著作。到了兵站，他总是和同志们吃一样的饭菜，和战士们睡在一个通铺上。天天如此，趟趟如此，他还向支委会提出了各级干部和战士“学习在一起，行车在一起，吃饭在一起，睡觉在一起”的建议，经过四次讨论，统一了认识，党支部作出了决定。这“四个在一起”，密切了上下级关系，大大促进了连队思想革命化。
    向共产主义的“公”字高峰攀登
    林彪副主席说：“我们要巩固社会主义制度，经济上的制度，政治上的制度，就必须提倡为公的观念，就是要塑造新的人来建设新的社会，塑造共产主义精神的人。”十烈士就是这样一批大公无私的共产主义战士。他们光辉的一生，是向共产主义“公”字高峰不断攀登的一生。
    在拔海五千米的雀儿山顶，在冰雪泥泞的草原上，在悬崖陡壁的险路旁，当战友们的车发生了故障，班长李荣昌同志，总是不顾饥饿寒冷，有时彻夜不眠，帮助战友修好。
    在医院里，有个重病人生命垂危，需要输血，身体不大好的杨星春，却主动报名献血，挽救了阶级兄弟的生命。
    连队炊事班需要人，入伍才两天的新战士陈昌元，放弃了学开车的机会，主动要求到炊事班工作。
    英雄的十烈士，心中只有毛主席，只有革命，只有人民，唯独没有他们自己。共产党员、排长曲月伦在他留下的日记中，写着这样铿锵有力的话：“一个共产党员为着人民的利益，想着共产主义事业，哪能不视死如归。”
    在险峻的达马拉山，二排一辆汽车滑到几百米的悬崖边，前轮悬空，车身倾斜，十分危急。曲月伦赶上前去，沉着地爬上驾驶室，把车子开离险境。一次军事训练中，一个新战士由于过分紧张，把手榴弹扔到离人群只有五、六米的地方。在这个关键时刻，曲月伦同志冒着生命危险，勇敢地冲上去，敏捷地拾起手榴弹扔了出去，避免了一场可能发生的伤亡事故。
    曲月伦同志大公无私的共产主义品德，永远留在战友心中。在连队里，提起曲排长，人人夸他是个“毫不利己专门利人”的人，人们能够把他一心为革命，一心为人民的故事讲得滔滔不绝。就拿他的“一架闹钟”的故事来说吧，他当了排长以后，特地选购了一个带夜光的闹钟。在家的时候，朝外放在玻璃窗边，行车路上，就挂在汽车驾驶室的挡风玻璃板上，让连里的同志白天晚上都能看到。有的同志问他：“排长，闹钟这么大，既不好看，又不好带，你怎么不买一块手表呢？”他说：“闹钟虽然不如手表好看，但手表只能一个人用，闹钟大家都可以用。”就是在这次紧急战备运输任务中，曲月伦同志带着全连的总救济车。兄弟连队六连有五台车，也和十二连一起出发，他主动让六连的车子走在前面，把六连的车子的救济任务也担当起来。他对救济车上的驾驶员和技工说：这样别人有个依靠，心里也踏实，我们人多车多，要主动想到人家的困难。当六连的车子抛了锚，他就主动上前修复。一天，六连的一台车大件坏了，要比较长的时间才能修好。他怕耽误六连同志吃不上饭，就对这台车的驾驶员说：你先开我的车子走，修好了我就来。他顶着高原秋夜的寒风，忍着饥饿，一直苦战到深夜。
    十烈士，是我军在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作群众运动进入新阶段涌现出来的光辉榜样，是在毛泽东思想大学校里成长起来的一代共产主义新人，是无产阶级的先进分子。他们真正做到了：生为毛主席的革命路线战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线献身。
    我们党有了这样的先进分子，必然是朝气蓬勃，必然能够领导无产阶级和革命群众，胜利地进行伟大的革命斗争！
    我们军队有了这样的先进分子，就有了最大的战斗力，在任何强大的敌人面前，攻无不克，所向披靡，一往无前！
    我们国家有了这样的先进分子，就能保证我们无产阶级专政的铁打江山，千秋万代永不变色！永远沿着毛主席的革命路线，向着光辉灿烂的共产主义阔步前进。新华社记者　《解放军报》通讯员《解放军报》记者　本报记者
