Spring has returned to the land, and the "Rain Water" season is approaching. The intense preparations for spring plowing have begun. The People's Liberation Army Shenyang troops' agricultural support personnel, who have made great contributions to agricultural support work, recently held a symposium to discuss what to focus on in the preparations for spring plowing. Everyone unanimously agreed that among the myriad tasks of spring plowing preparations, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives and arming the broad masses of commune members and rural cadres with Mao Zedong Thought is the top priority. We must work hard to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, starting from promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, to do a good job in spring plowing preparations, and to achieve even greater agricultural production in 1968.

The participants in this symposium were mostly responsible comrades from the front lines of agricultural support work in the three northeastern provinces. During the meeting, they were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, summarizing and exchanging experiences and insights on implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives, and studying and deploying measures to help the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural grassroots cadres further implement Chairman Mao's latest directives and do a good job in spring plowing preparations.

The attendees reviewed the work of the past year. They unanimously agreed that the reason for achieving great success in agricultural support work is summarized in six words: "Highly, Closely, and Implement." This means, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, to highly uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and implement Chairman Mao's latest directives well.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." The attendees discussed and studied this teaching in conjunction with actual conditions, and gained a deeper understanding of it. They said, the greatest productive force is not the double-wheel double-share plow, nor the tractor, but the commune members and cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Once people's thinking is revolutionized and active thinking is resolved, everything will fall into place, not just for the spring plowing and preparation stages, but for the entire year and the long term. Therefore, they pointed out that no matter how busy the preparations and spring plowing production are, in agricultural support work, we must prioritize propagating Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives, and focus on the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. We must take "Fight Self, Criticize Revisionism" as the key, and establish and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to help the broad masses of commune members and rural cadres further establish the idea of farming for revolution.

At the meeting, everyone pointed out: In the preparations and spring plowing production, we must be especially vigilant against the plots of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and snakes to sabotage the revolution and production. We must use Chairman Mao's teaching of "Never forget class struggle" to arm the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres, and give a resolute blow to the class enemies who dare to engage in sabotage activities. Everyone unanimously expressed that this year is the year to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Doing a good job in agricultural production not only has significant economic implications but also significant political implications. The key to a year's work lies in spring. The preparations and spring plowing work are the most critical battles in agricultural production. If this battle is won, it will set a good start and lay a solid foundation for achieving even greater harvests in 1968. We must start early, grasp tightly, and do a good job. The leading comrades of all levels of agricultural support troops are determined to personally go down to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, assist the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres in combining revolution with production, and make this year's preparations and spring plowing even better. In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will create new merits for the people.

    解放军沈阳部队支农工作人员举行座谈会
    从思想革命化入手做好春耕准备
    据新华社沈阳十五日电　春回大地，“雨水”将到，紧张的春耕准备工作开始了。在支农工作中作出了巨大贡献的人民解放军沈阳部队支农工作人员，最近举行座谈会，研究了备耕工作着重抓什么的问题？大家一致认为，备耕工作有一千条，一万条，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想武装广大社员和农村干部是第一条。一定要在落实毛主席最新指示上狠下功夫，从促进人的思想革命化入手，做好备耕工作，夺取一九六八年农业生产的更大丰收。
    参加这次座谈会的人员，大多是来自东北三省支农第一线的负责同志。他们在会议期间，满怀革命豪情，总结和交流了落实毛主席最新指示的经验和体会，研究和部署了帮助广大贫下中农和农村基层干部进一步落实毛主席最新指示，搞好春耕准备工作的措施。
    到会同志回顾了一年来的工作。一致认为，在支农工作上所以能够取得巨大成就，概括起来是六个字：高举、紧跟、落实。这就是和广大贫下中农一道，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，落实好毛主席的最新指示。
    毛主席教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”到会同志结合实际进行学习讨论，对毛主席的这一教导领会得更深刻了。他们说，最大的生产力不是双轮双铧犁，不是拖拉机，而是用毛泽东思想武装起来的社员群众和干部。人的思想革命化抓好了，活思想解决好了，就一通百通，就不只是管备耕、春耕一个阶段，而是管全年，管长远。因此，他们指出，不管备耕、春耕生产有多忙，在支农工作中都必须把宣传毛泽东思想，落实毛主席最新指示，狠抓人的思想革命化放在首位。要以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，促进广大社员和农村干部进一步树立为革命种田的思想。
    会上，大家指出：在备耕和春耕生产中，要特别警惕党内一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神破坏革命和生产的阴谋。要用毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，武装广大贫下中农和农村干部的头脑，对敢于进行阴谋破坏活动的阶级敌人给以坚决打击。大家一致表示，今年是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一年，搞好农业生产不仅有重大的经济意义，而且有重大的政治意义。一年之计在于春。备耕、春耕工作，是农业生产最关键的一仗，这一仗打好了，就能为夺取一九六八年更大丰收开一个好头，打下良好基础，一定要抓早，抓紧，抓好。各级支农部队的领导同志，决心亲自下去抓落实毛主席最新指示的工作，协助广大贫下中农和农村革命干部抓革命、促生产，把今年的备耕、春耕搞得更好，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，为人民立新功。
