Guangdong Implements Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions to Review and Summarize the Cultural Revolution Movement Over the Past Year and a Half

40 Million People Pledge to Achieve Complete Victory in the Cultural Revolution

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 2nd: The 40 million revolutionary people of Guangdong Province, through thorough reviews and summaries, have implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions condition by condition and in full. They have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and the tide of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination is surging forward. The flames of revolutionary criticism are burning more fiercely, and the unity between the military and the people has reached an unprecedented level. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire province is better than ever, fully proving Chairman Mao's scientific prediction that "in a few more months, the overall situation will be even better."

Currently, the fundamental characteristic of the Cultural Revolution in Guangdong is that the revolutionary people of the entire province firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and are implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions condition by condition and in full. They are full of vigor and determination, pressing on and striving for victory. They are determined to achieve comprehensive victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution in the new year in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization. In the past few months, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Guangdong Province have used Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions to thoroughly review and summarize the Cultural Revolution movement over the past year and a half. The broad revolutionary masses have used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the standard to review and summarize their own words and deeds. Their unanimous conclusion is: whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions will definitely be victorious; otherwise, it will deviate from the path and lose direction.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force and an invincible spiritual atomic bomb." After thorough reviews and summaries, the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people of the entire province love our great leader Chairman Mao even more and have an even stronger faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In Guangdong, the number of people reading Chairman Mao's works has never been as widespread as it is today; the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought has never been as conscious as it is today; the execution of Chairman Mao's instructions has never been as resolute as it is today; and the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has never been as thorough as it is today. Currently, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in cities and countryside across Guangdong are springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. They have become large-scale schools for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Now, the province has already held 23,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 3.3 million people participating in the studies.

Most inspiring is that the mass movement in Guangdong Province to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions has developed to a new stage of extensive study, extensive propagation, extensive application, extensive implementation, condition by condition implementation, and full implementation. The appearance of this thriving situation is first because the revolutionary learning style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao has been established, combining theory with practice, learning and applying immediately, and seeing results right away. The emergence of internal and external combined study classes and thematic study classes is a new creation by the revolutionary masses in their learning and practice to carry forward Chairman Mao's advocated revolutionary learning style. Secondly, the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Guangdong Province have used Chairman Mao's latest instructions to review the movement, affirm achievements, find problems, summarize experiences, and solve them in a timely manner, which has not only enhanced their confidence in achieving greater victories but also improved their level of struggle. Thirdly, they have thoroughly transformed their world outlook and sparked a revolution in their souls. Many revolutionary people have realized that the character "private" is the root of the evil of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They hate the character "private" like a plague and despise factionalism to the bone. Everywhere, a "people's war" to besiege the character "private" and overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has been formed. People's ideological appearance has undergone profound changes, making the Cultural Revolution in Guangdong continue to advance towards victory under Chairman Mao's guidance.

Achieving revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Currently, the characteristics of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in Guangdong are that the steps are fast, the ideological foundation is good, both spectacular and solid, irresistible, and unstoppable. Now, large and medium-sized factories in Guangzhou City have basically achieved revolutionary unity, and most schools and institutions have also achieved revolutionary unity. In the province, 80 counties and cities have already achieved revolutionary unity and reached agreements on revolutionary unity. A batch of prefectures, counties, and cities have already established revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory groups.

The vigorous development of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination has pushed the revolutionary criticism and the revolution and production in cities and countryside across Guangdong Province to a new stage.

After summarizing the experience of the Cultural Revolution movement over the past year and a half, the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people have increasingly deeply felt that the People's Liberation Army, personally created by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the iron wall defending the socialist motherland, and the strong backing of the proletarian Cultural Revolution. The People's Liberation Army units stationed in the Guangzhou area have made outstanding contributions in the "three supports and two militaries" work.

    广东运用毛主席最新指示对一年多来文化革命运动进行大检查大总结
    四千万人民誓夺文化大革命全面胜利
    据新华社广州二日电　广东省四千万革命人民通过大检查，大总结，条条落实、全面落实毛主席最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，革命大联合和革命三结合的洪流滚滚向前，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，军民空前团结。全省革命和生产形势空前大好，完全证实了伟大领袖毛主席所指出的“再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好”的科学预见。
    当前，广东文化大革命的根本特点是：全省革命人民紧紧掌握毛泽东思想，正在条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，鼓足干劲，再接再厉，决心在新的一年从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。在最近几个月中，广东省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众运用毛主席的一系列极为重要的最新指示，对一年多来的文化革命运动进行了深入的大检查，大总结。广大革命群众以毛主席的最新指示为标准，检查和总结自己的言行。他们得出的一致结论是：凡是符合毛泽东思想，符合毛主席最新指示的，就一定胜利；否则就会走上歪路，迷失方向。
    林彪副主席说：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”经过大检查，大总结，全省的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，更加热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席，更加信仰战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在广东，读毛主席著作的人，从来没有象今天这样广泛；宣传毛泽东思想，从来没有象今天这样自觉；执行毛主席的指示，从来没有象今天这样坚决；贯彻毛主席的革命路线，从来没有象今天这样彻底。目前，广东城乡各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋兴办起来，已成为活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，成为斗私批修的战场。现在，全省已经办了毛泽东思想学习班二万三千多期，参加学习的达三百三十多万人。
    最令人鼓舞的是，广东省学习和执行毛主席最新指示的群众运动，已经发展到大学习、大传播、大运用、大贯彻、条条落实、全面落实的新阶段。这种蓬蓬勃勃的局面的出现，首先是因为树立了毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，理论联系实际，学了就用，立竿见影。内外结合学习班和专题学习班的纷纷涌现，是革命群众为了发扬毛主席倡导的革命学风，在学习实践中的新创造。其次，广东省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众用毛主席的最新指示，检查运动，肯定成绩，找出问题，总结经验，及时解决，既增强了夺取更大胜利的信心，又提高了斗争的水平。第三，彻底改造世界观，在灵魂深处爆发革命。许多革命群众都认识到，私字是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的祸根。他们对私字疾恶如仇，对派性恨之入骨。到处形成围剿私字，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的“人民战争”，人的思想面貌发生了深刻的变化，使广东的文化大革命运动始终沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。
    实现革命大联合和革命三结合，是毛主席伟大战略部署的一个重要组成部分。当前，广东革命大联合和革命三结合的特点是，步伐快，思想基础好，既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实，势如破竹，锐不可挡。现在，广州市大、中型工厂已经基本实现了革命大联合，大部分学校、机关也实现了革命大联合。全省各地区已经有八十个县、市实现革命大联合和达成革命大联合的协议，一批专区、县、市已经成立革命委员会或革筹小组。
    革命大联合和革命三结合的蓬勃发展，把广东全省城乡的革命大批判和抓革命、促生产推向了一个新阶段。
    经过总结一年多文化大革命运动的经验，广大的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，越来越深切地体会到，毛主席亲手缔造、林彪副主席亲自指挥的中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的支柱，是保卫社会主义祖国的钢铁长城，是无产阶级文化大革命的坚强后盾。人民解放军驻广州地区部队，在“三支”“两军”工作中做出了卓越的贡献。
