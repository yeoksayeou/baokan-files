In the globally watched battlefield of Khe Sanh, the U.S. aggressors have fallen into the net of death set by the South Vietnamese people. The U.S. military base at Khe Sanh has become an isolated island in the vast sea of the people's war in South Vietnam. Land transportation has been cut off, and ammunition and supplies are entirely dependent on airlifts. Under the heavy blows of the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people, the U.S. aggressors at Khe Sanh are like sitting on pins and needles, trembling with fear, constantly worrying about their impending doom. A report in the February 12 issue of the U.S. *Newsweek* vividly depicts the pathetic plight of the besieged U.S. troops at Khe Sanh. Below is a summary of the report.

The U.S. Marine Corps base at Khe Sanh is roughly a half-mile long and a quarter-mile wide. The base is filled with trenches covered with sandbags.

As your plane's wheels touch the metal matting of the base's runway, your first concern is survival.

Getting off the plane at Khe Sanh is like jumping off a slow-moving freight train. U.S. Air Force transport planes make 12 to 15 trips to the Khe Sanh base daily. These planes never stop. The reason is that if they stop, the planes will become sitting ducks for the VC (referring to the Viet Cong) gunners who are constantly shelling the base. To avoid becoming "sitting ducks," the transport planes open the tail compartment doors while still taxiing on the runway, throwing out personnel and supplies. Three minutes after landing, the pilots will start the engines and take off at a 45-degree angle to avoid shelling. Communist forces' machine-gun positions are only a mile or so away from the end of the runway.

The U.S. Marines at Khe Sanh have developed a special character under the constant shelling by the VC. After being shelled, everyone is extremely tense. Under these circumstances, no one walks. Instead, everyone moves by running, with one eye always looking for possible cover. Even the drivers, with one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand on the half-open car door, are ready to jump out of the car at the first sign of trouble. Only after the shock subsides can the base return to normal. Then, the Marines will slow down their movements and dispel the fear from their faces.

A terrifying whistling sound passes overhead. In an instant, a bomb explodes behind me. I hear a familiar, painful cry: "Carry the bodies, carry the bodies!" At the same time, a soldier crouching in a trench screams, "Don't gather, scatter quickly."

A mortar shell hit the trench of Colonel David Lownds, the commander of the Khe Sanh Marine base. The colonel from Florida was not in his trench. However, lying across the road in front of the trench was a Marine officer, his flak jacket blown off, with a large pool of blood beside him. From his eyes, it was clear that he was already dead. He was a lieutenant who had arrived at Khe Sanh just 24 hours earlier to take over as the battalion executive officer. A Marine muttered to himself, saying words he had heard many times: "You never know when death will come."

Thirty minutes later, before the panic had subsided, another explosion shook the entire base. This is the daily scene. With each new barrage of mortars and rockets, the U.S. Marines at Khe Sanh will have to continue in a state of tension.

    瓮中之鳖
    溪山美国侵略军狼狈相
    在举世瞩目的溪山战场，美国侵略者陷入了南越人民布下的天罗地网之中。溪山美军基地已成为南越人民战争汪洋大海中的一座孤岛，陆路交通已被切断，弹药给养全靠空运。在越南南方人民解放武装力量的重重打击下，溪山美国侵略者如坐针毡，胆战心惊，时刻耽心他们末日的来临。二月十二日美国《新闻周刊》的一篇报道，活龙活现地描绘出了陷入绝境的溪山美军的一副狼狈相。下面是报道的摘要。
    现在溪山的美国海军陆战队基地，大约是一个长约半英里，宽约四分之一英里的军营。军营内战壕满布，战壕上面有沙包掩盖。
    当你乘坐的飞机机轮接触到军营机场跑道的金属垫时，你首先注意的问题一定是争取生存的问题。
    在溪山下机，好象是从一列慢驶的载货火车跳下来一样。美国空军运输机，每天来往溪山基地十二次到十五次。这些运输机从不停定。原因是假如停定的话，飞机就会变成坐定的鸭子，让不断向基地炮轰的越共（指越南南方人民解放军）炮手瞄个正着。为了避免变成“坐定的鸭子”，运输机还在跑道上滑行的时候，就把机尾的舱门打开，把人员和物资抛出去。着陆后三分钟，机师就会发动引擎，以四十五度的角度起飞，以避免炮火。共产党部队的机关炮位离机场跑道末端只有一英里多一点。
    溪山的美国陆战队，在越共的不断炮轰下，形成某种特殊的性格。在受到炮轰后，大家都非常紧张。在这种情况下，没有人步行。相反，大家都是跑步移动，有一只眼睛总是在寻找可能的掩护。连驾车的司机，也总是一手抓住方向盘，另一手按着半开着的车门，准备在发现麻烦迹象时迅速跳车。只有在这种震惊情况过去后，基地才能恢复常态。随后，陆战队才会放慢动作和驱散脸上的惧色。
    可怕的嘘嘘声从头顶掠过。顷刻之间，炮弹隆然巨响落在我后面的一个地方。我听到一种熟识的痛苦的呼唤：“搬尸体，搬尸体！”与此同时，蜷缩在一个战壕的一个士兵尖声叫嚷：“不要聚集，快点散开。”
    迫击炮击中了溪山陆战队基地司令戴维德·劳恩兹上校的战壕。这个佛罗里达州籍的上校司令，没有在自己的战壕里。不过，在战壕前面的路上，横卧着一个陆战队军官，他的避弹衣已被炸去一半，身体旁边有一大滩血。从他的眼色看上去，他显然已经死了。他是二十四小时前才赶到溪山接任团级副官的一个中尉。一个陆战队员仰头喃喃自语，说出长期听惯的话：“你们永远也不会知道，死神什么时候会到来。”
    三十分钟后，惊慌情绪尚未消逝，另一次爆炸又使整个基地震动起来。这就是整天的情形。随着每次新的迫击炮和火箭的轰击，溪山美国陆战队将不得不继续处于紧张的状态。
