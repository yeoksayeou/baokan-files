The county and commune revolutionary committees have held study classes with the participation of poor and lower-middle peasants, achieving remarkable results. The revolutionary committee of Hejin County in Shanxi Province has summarized five advantages:

1. Poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao the most and are the most loyal to him, which can educate the students to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.
2. Poor and lower-middle peasants implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line most resolutely and oppose the Chinese Khrushchev most resolutely, which can raise the students' awareness of the struggle between the two lines.
3. Poor and lower-middle peasants have a living history of class struggle filled with blood and tears, which can provide the students with profound class education and raise their awareness of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism.
4. Poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and put them into practice, which can help the students establish a good revolutionary study style and promptly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.
5. Poor and lower-middle peasants studying together with cadres can strengthen the relationship between superiors and subordinates and enhance unity between cadres and the masses.

Editor's Note: Our great leader Chairman Mao has said, "The army should have soldiers participate in study classes." The revolutionary committee of Hejin County in Shanxi Province, following Chairman Mao's instructions, has invited poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the study classes held by the county revolutionary committee, achieving immediate results.

Chairman Mao often teaches us to learn from the masses and to humbly be the students of the masses. Inviting poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in study classes is a good method and approach to learn from the masses and absorb the experience and wisdom of the masses. Some things seem difficult to handle, but once discussed with the masses or mobilized by the masses, the difficulties will be easily resolved. Hejin County's revolutionary committee, by inviting poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, has easily solved a series of major issues related to implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, such as cadre issues and eliminating factionalism to promote revolutionary great unity. This is a powerful proof.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with them, we can overcome any difficulty and defeat any enemy, rather than being defeated by them." All newly established revolutionary committees should pay attention to maintaining close ties with the masses. Staying close to the masses at all times is an important guarantee for us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and an important guarantee for our socialist motherland to remain ever-vigorous.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hejin County's revolutionary committee in Shanxi Province, as early as last October, mobilized the masses to hold study classes on Mao Zedong Thought throughout the county, with the participation of cadres at various levels, representatives of mass organizations, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army and militia who support the left. How to make the study classes better? The cadres of the revolutionary committee and the revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's instructions such as "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution," "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience," and "The army should have soldiers participate in study classes," decided to invite a certain number of poor and lower-middle peasants with rich experience in class struggle to participate in the study classes.

Holding study classes with the participation of poor and lower-middle peasants has effectively promoted the comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving immediate results in developing and consolidating the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the county, and promoting the revolution to promote production. Now, 90% of the cadres at the county, commune, and brigade levels have been liberated, and many have participated in the temporary power organs of the "three-in-one combination." The production throughout the county is also booming.

After participating in the study classes held by the county revolutionary committee, the poor and lower-middle peasants seriously study, deeply understand, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They not only take the lead in the struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," but also help cadres and leaders of mass organizations to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism with the attitude of "treating the illness to save the patient." In Yumen Commune, some cadres, due to being criticized by the masses during the Cultural Revolution, had grievances and thus had a one-sided view of the situation. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the same group studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with these cadres, raised questions together, discussed together, and found answers together. First, they pointed out that the view of the situation has class characteristics and must be based on the public interest of the proletariat to view the situation, not based on personal interests. Otherwise, one cannot arrive at the correct answer. With the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, these cadres realized that their past views of the situation had three errors: first, viewing the situation from personal and selfish interests rather than public interests; second, the poison of the "Study Outline" had not been completely eliminated, lacking a deep understanding of the mass movement; third, not using class viewpoint to view "chaos," not knowing that chaos is chaos for the enemy. After correcting the wrong views, a great situation unfolded before them. In some communes like Chaijia, Taiyang, and Tonghua, due to serious factionalism, the revolutionary mass organizations were in opposition, causing obstacles to revolutionary great unity. When they came to the study class, they did not speak to each other, secretly guarded against each other, ready to "fight" at any time, with no intention of unity. Seeing this situation, the poor and lower-middle peasants actively and proactively used Chairman Mao's latest instructions to do ideological and political work for both sides. To awaken the class consciousness of the leaders of both sides, 166 poor and lower-middle peasants respectively recalled their blood and tears history in large and small meetings. The study class used these blood and tears history as teaching materials to carry out the activities of "three remembrances, three talks, three looks, and three examinations."

The "three remembrances" are: remembering the bitterness of class oppression, remembering the bitterness of national oppression, and remembering the bitterness of persecution by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie; the "three talks" are: talking about family history, talking about village history, and talking about revolutionary struggle history; the "three looks" are: looking at the liberation of the poor and lower-middle peasants, looking at the great changes in the motherland over the past 18 years, and looking at the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution; the "three examinations" are: examining whether one's thoughts are loyal to Chairman Mao, examining whether one's path is in line with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and examining whether one has followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment during the Cultural Revolution. The study class also carried out the "four comparisons" activity among the leaders of the opposing revolutionary mass organizations, namely, comparing the struggle against selfishness, comparing self-criticism, comparing taking responsibility, and comparing implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. These activities greatly raised the class consciousness of the leaders of the opposing revolutionary mass organizations. Many leaders of mass organizations made sincere self-criticisms and deeply excavated selfishness and factionalism from their souls.

In the study class, the poor and lower-middle peasants also helped the students solve the problem of how to correctly treat cadres. The poor and lower-middle peasants are most familiar with and most protective of cadres. They analyzed the situation of some commune and brigade cadres and believed that the main reason why cadres did not come forward was that, from the cadres' side, they could not correctly treat the masses and themselves; from the masses' side, they could not treat cadres dialectically and had factionalism. They did work based on these two aspects of the cause and achieved good results. The party branch secretary of Zhangshang Brigade in Xiaoliang Commune, Zhao Yantang, had a grudge in his heart because the masses posted big-character posters on him during the Cultural Revolution and did not want to be a cadre. The poor and lower-middle peasant representative from the same village, Wang Zhuojia, in the study class, talked to Zhao Yantang privately three times, recalled the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the village with him, and earnestly told Zhao Yantang: During the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants posted big-character posters on you to help you correct your mistakes and better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Wang Zhuojia's words deeply moved Zhao Yantang, making him realize that his intention to lie down and not work was essentially to leave the poor and lower-middle peasants and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which was absolutely not allowed! Therefore, Zhao Yantang expressed his determination to fight alongside all the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses in the village forever and to revolutionize to the end.

The revolutionary cadres, representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army and militia who support the left participating in the study classes on Mao Zedong Thought all regard the poor and lower-middle peasants as their best teachers and humbly learn from them. They summarized through personal experience that there are five advantages to having poor and lower-middle peasants participate in study classes:

1. Poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao the most and are the most loyal to him. Their participation in study classes can educate the students to receive a profound education of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.
2. Poor and lower-middle peasants implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line most resolutely and oppose the Chinese Khrushchev most resolutely. The participation of poor and lower-middle peasants in study classes can educate the students on the struggle between the two lines, raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and make the students more consciously stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.
3. Poor and lower-middle peasants have suffered oppression and exploitation from the old society and have deep hatred. Each poor and lower-middle peasant has a living history of class struggle filled with blood and tears. Participating in study classes with poor and lower-middle peasants can provide the students with profound class education and raise their awareness of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism.
4. Poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. They follow Chairman Mao's words sentence by sentence, putting them into practice without the slightest deviation, having a good revolutionary study style of combining theory with practice. Studying with poor and lower-middle peasants can change the bad study style of some people and promptly and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.
5. Poor and lower-middle peasants studying together with cadres can strengthen the relationship between superiors and subordinates and enhance unity between cadres and the masses.

    县社办学习班有贫下中农参加好
    河津县总结出五大好处：
    一、贫下中农最热爱毛主席，最忠于毛主席，可使学员们受到无限忠于毛主席的教育；二、贫下中农执行毛主席的革命路线最坚决、反对中国赫鲁晓夫最坚决，可以提高学员们两条路线斗争的觉悟；三、贫下中农有活的血泪斑斑的阶级斗争史，学员们可以受到深刻的阶级教育，提高斗私批修自觉性；四、贫下中农最听毛主席的话，说到做到，可以使学员树立良好的革命学风，及时落实毛主席最新指示；五、贫下中农和干部在一起学习，有利于密切上下级关系，加强干群团结。
    编者按：我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“军队办学习班要有战士参加”。山西省河津县革命委员会，遵照毛主席的教导，吸收贫下中农参加县革命委员会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，取得了立竿见影的效果。
    毛主席经常教导我们要向群众学习，恭恭敬敬地当群众的小学生。吸收贫下中农参加学习班，正是向群众学习，汲取群众经验和智慧的好方法、好途径。有些事情，看起来似乎很难办，可是，一经和群众商量，或者发动群众去办，困难就会迎刃而解。河津县革命委员会由于吸收贫下中农参加毛泽东思想学习班，有关落实毛主席最新指示的一系列重大问题，例如干部问题，消除派性促进革命大联合等问题，都比较容易地得到了解决。这就是有力的证明。
    毛主席教导我们：“只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”一切新生的革命委员会，都应该注意密切和群众的联系。紧紧地依靠群众，一刻也不脱离群众，这是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证，是使我们的社会主义祖国永远保持鲜红的颜色的重要保证。
    据新华社太原十日电　山西省河津县革命委员会早在去年十月份就放手发动群众，在全县大办有各级革命干部、各群众组织负责人和支左的解放军指战员、民兵干部参加的毛泽东思想学习班。怎样才能把学习班办得更好？革命委员会的干部和无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席的“没有贫农，便没有革命”、“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”、“军队办学习班要有战士参加”等伟大指示，决定吸收一定数量的有丰富阶级斗争经验的贫下中农参加学习班。
  大办有贫下中农参加的学习班，有力地促进了毛主席最新指示的全面落实，对发展和巩固全县的革命大联合、革命三结合和推动抓革命促生产，都收到了立竿见影的效果。现在，全县县级、公社级、大队级的干部有百分之九十已经解放，不少人还参加了“三结合”的临时权力机构。全县生产也搞得热火朝天。
    贫下中农参加县革命委员会举办的毛泽东思想学习班后，认真学习、深刻领会和贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示。他们不光以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，在斗私批修中起表率作用，而且以“治病救人”的态度，帮助干部和革命群众组织的头头进行斗私批修。禹门公社一些干部由于在文化大革命中受到群众的批判，有委屈情绪，因而对形势也产生了片面的看法。同一个小组的贫下中农，就和这些干部一起学习毛主席的最新指示，一起提出问题，一起讨论，一起寻找答案。首先，他们指出对形势的看法是有阶级性的，一定要以无产阶级的公字为出发点去看形势，不能从私字出发去看形势，否则便不能得出正确的答案。在贫下中农的帮助下，这些干部认识到自己过去看形势有三个错误：一是从私字和我字出发去看形势，而不是从公字出发去看形势；二是黑《修养》的余毒还未肃清，对群众运动缺乏深刻的理解；三是没有用阶级观点看待“乱”，不知道乱是乱了敌人。纠正了错误看法之后，一片大好形势便展现在他们眼前。柴家、太阳、通化等公社的一些革命群众组织，由于派性严重，互相对立，给革命大联合造成了障碍。他们前来学习班时，互不说话，暗中互相戒备，随时准备“交战”，没有一点联合的意思。贫下中农看到这个情况，便积极主动地用毛主席的最新指示给双方做思想政治工作。为了启发双方组织负责人的阶级觉悟，有一百六十六个贫下中农分别在大小会上回忆了自己的血泪史。学习班以这些血泪史为教材，在学员中开展了“三忆、三讲、三看、三查”活动。
    三忆是：忆阶级压迫苦，忆民族压迫苦，忆资产阶级反动路线迫害苦；三讲是：讲家史，讲村史，讲革命斗争史；三看是：看贫下中农翻身得解放，看十八年来祖国的巨大变化，看文化大革命的伟大成绩；三查是：查自己思想是不是忠于毛主席，查自己走过的道路是不是符合毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，查在文化大革命中自己是不是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。学习班还在对立的两派革命群众组织负责人中开展了“四比”活动，即斗私比自觉；自我批评比主动；承担责任比姿态；落实毛主席最新指示比行动。这些活动大大地提高了对立着的革命群众组织负责人的阶级觉悟。不少群众组织负责人作了认真的自我批评，在灵魂深处狠挖了私字和派性。
    在学习班里，贫下中农还帮助学员们解决了如何正确对待干部这个问题。贫下中农最熟悉干部，也最爱护干部，他们分析了一些公社、大队干部的情况，认为干部站不出来的主要原因，从干部方面讲，是不能正确地对待群众，对待自己；从群众方面讲，是不能一分为二地对待干部，有派性。他们针对这两方面的原因去做工作，收到了良好的效果。小梁公社寨上大队党支部书记赵彦堂在文化大革命中因为群众给他贴了大字报，心中一直有疙瘩，不想当干部。同村的贫下中农代表王卓家，在学习班里三番五次找赵彦堂个别谈心，和他一起回忆本村的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争史，语重心长地对赵彦堂说：在文化大革命中，贫下中农给你贴大字报，是为了帮助你改正错误，更好地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。王卓家的一席话，深深地打动了赵彦堂，使他认识到自己想躺倒不干，实质是要离开贫下中农，离开毛主席的革命路线。这是万万不能的！于是，赵彦堂表示一定和全村的贫下中农、革命群众永远战斗在一起，革命到底。
    参加毛泽东思想学习班的革命干部、革命群众组织负责人和支左的解放军同志、民兵代表，都把贫下中农当成自己最好的老师，虚心向贫下中农学习。他们通过亲身体验，总结出贫下中农参加学习班有五大好处：一、贫下中农最热爱毛主席、最忠于毛主席，他们参加学习班，可以使学员们受到一次深刻的无限忠于毛主席的教育。二、贫下中农贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最坚决、反对中国赫鲁晓夫最坚决，贫下中农参加学习班，对学员们进行两条路线斗争的教育，提高他们两条路线斗争的觉悟，使学员们更加自觉地站到毛主席的革命路线上来有好处。三、贫下中农受旧社会压迫剥削，苦大仇深，每个贫下中农都有一部活的血泪斑斑的阶级斗争史。和贫下中农一起参加学习班，学员们可以受到深刻的阶级教育，提高斗私批修的自觉性。四、贫下中农最听毛主席的话。毛主席的话，他们句句照办，说到做到，一丝一毫不走样，有良好的理论联系实际的革命学风。和贫下中农一起学习，可以改变一些人身上的不良学风，及时全面地落实毛主席的最新指示。五、贫下中农和干部在一起学习，官教兵，兵教官，有利于密切上下级之间的关系，加强干群之间的团结。
