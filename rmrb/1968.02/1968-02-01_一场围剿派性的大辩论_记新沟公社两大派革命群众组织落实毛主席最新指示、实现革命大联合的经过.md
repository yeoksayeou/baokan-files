The revolutionary masses of Xin Gou Commune in Dong Gou County, Dan Dong City, Liaoning Province, due to the instigation of capitalist-roaders and the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, split into two factions, "Dong Lian" and "Bing Tuan," and the "civil war" has been going on without stopping. The propaganda team of a certain unit of the Dan Dong garrison saw that both factions were revolutionary mass organizations with poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, so they invited the leaders of both factions to discuss the issue of revolutionary great unity. Unexpectedly, as soon as they sat down together, the leaders of both factions seized the opportunity to attack each other's shortcomings and exaggerated them. The "Dong Lian" faction said, "Your organization is full of ghosts and snakes, and you are doing nothing but beating, smashing, and looting. You are bad from head to toe and have no virtue. We cannot sit on the same bench with you." The "Bing Tuan" faction said, "We are engaged in a struggle between two lines with 'Dong Lian.' To unite with them is to advocate the extinction of class struggle." They sat together and talked for three times, and both sides came in a huff and left after a few rounds of verbal attacks.

	Using Mao Zedong Thought to Arm the Minds of the Masses

Faced with this stalemate, what should be done? The propaganda team comrades firmly believed in the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly believed that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants would listen to Chairman Mao's words. They propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses of both factions while inviting the leaders of various combat teams of both factions to hold discussion meetings, and also invited some poor and lower-middle peasants with deep bitterness to participate.

As soon as the discussion meeting began, the atmosphere of "civil war" was set. As soon as the leaders of both factions entered the venue, one faction sat on the east side and the other on the west side, naturally separating from each other. The leader of the "Bing Tuan" faction said, "Today, let's have a 'Yang Zhenrong Banquet,' a battle of wits." The leader of the "Dong Lian" faction also said, "No matter what tricks they play, we will have a 'Sun Wukong Saves Tang Monk,' a three-strike battle against the White Bone Demon." Both factions were whispering and strategizing separately.

The comrades of the propaganda team were undaunted and led everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with unwavering confidence: "Within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions." After studying, they let everyone discuss how to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

As soon as the comrades of the propaganda team finished speaking, someone suddenly stood up and said:

	"I think our commune's situation is special, and we can't unite."

	"This passage is for workers, not for us peasants!"

This remark infuriated the old poor peasant Xiong Wen Kui sitting next to him. He stood up and said angrily:

	"That's not right! Chairman Mao's words are effective wherever they are used. Do we poor and lower-middle peasants have fundamental conflicts of interest?"

Xiong Wen Kui used his own bitter experiences to explain that in the old society, landlords were equally cruel, and all poor people were one family. Another old poor peasant followed up, saying:

	"If there is a fundamental conflict of interest, it is between us poor and lower-middle peasants and the capitalist-roaders and landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Among us poor and lower-middle peasants, there is fundamentally no question of you die I live."

The teachings of Mao Zedong and the words of the old poor peasants were not easily understood by some young people who had not experienced class suffering. The debate continued. Two young people from the "Bing Tuan" faction said:

	"Grandpa Xiong is talking about the old society. Now it's a new society, the situation has changed."

Old poor peasant Du Lianfu firmly disagreed, saying:

	"What has changed? Even if the sky changes and the earth changes, the class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants will never change! During the land reform, when we fought the landlords and divided the land, the poor and lower-middle peasants were united as one. At that time, we had one heart, united to overthrow the landlords, and completely liberated ourselves."

Old poor peasant Wan Shixiang from Cheng Cheng Team Four continued:

	"During the cooperative movement, the landlords and rich peasants were laughing on the sidelines, wanting to see our jokes; the well-off middle peasants were afraid of losing out and did not join the cooperative. It was we poor and lower-middle peasants who responded to Chairman Mao's call and established the cooperative. There were no carts, so we carried them on our backs; there were no draft animals, so we pulled the plows with people. Everyone's hearts were united. Not long after the cooperative was established, the Chinese Khrushchev said that too many cooperatives were established and should be dissolved. We poor and lower-middle peasants would not dissolve! We and the Chinese Khrushchev's handful of capitalist-roaders are mortal enemies, and we have a fundamental conflict of interest."

The speeches of the three old poor peasants livened up the debate in the meeting. Everyone started discussing. One said, "That's right, not false at all. When I think of the old society, I am happy from the bottom of my heart about the unity of us poor and lower-middle peasants." Another said, "Interesting! Interesting! In the old society, the landlords benefited, and the poor and lower-middle peasants suffered. What conflict of interest do we poor brothers have?"

	The Root of the Split Lies with the Chinese Khrushchev

The meeting reached this point, and the leaders of both combat teams began to calm down, recalling the more than a year of struggle during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Someone couldn't help but raise this question:

	"Since we have no fundamental conflict of interest, why did we split into two factions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and become like sworn enemies?"

This question made everyone discuss again, and everyone raised their hands to speak. They said, "When the Cultural Revolution began, we poor and lower-middle peasants had no factions. It was the Chinese Khrushchev who, in order to protect himself and other capitalist-roaders and ghosts and snakes, put forward the bourgeois reactionary line, incited the masses to fight the masses, formed factions, and attacked each other, which split us into two factions. The root of the evil lies entirely with the Chinese Khrushchev."

However, someone continued to raise a question: "I understand this! But why do I support some things in my faction, and you oppose them in your faction? For example, why do we have different opinions on some revolutionary cadres, one wants to overthrow, and one wants to protect?"

Before the words were finished, someone immediately stood up and first read a passage from the "Sixteen Points": "There are different opinions among the people, which is a normal phenomenon. The debate among several different opinions is inevitable, necessary, and beneficial. The masses will, through normal and full debate, affirm the correct and correct the wrong, gradually reach a consensus." Then, he said, our views on some things and some cadres are not consistent, which is a normal phenomenon; originally, as long as we follow the "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we can present facts and reason, and our views can be fully negotiated and unified. But why do we have to fight to the death?

A series of questions aroused everyone's deep thoughts and opened everyone's minds. The meeting was full of discussions, and many people were asking and answering themselves: "Why can't we act according to the 'Sixteen Points'? Why can't Chairman Mao's latest instructions be implemented? Why can't we resolve our internal problems? This is because of selfishness and factionalism." Slowly, everyone reached a consensus: "A thousand contradictions, ten thousand contradictions, the greatest contradiction is with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party; this conflict of interest, that conflict of interest, the socialist road and the capitalist road are the most fundamental conflicts of interest; you say you are right, I say I am right, if you do not fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, if you do not overthrow factionalism, it does not conform to the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought."

	Overthrow Factionalism, Achieve Revolutionary Great Unity in Struggle

The meeting became more lively, and more people spoke, and the atmosphere was more active. Everyone discussed and began a major debate to suppress bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. One said, factionalism is bad, it blinds us, disturbs our hearts, makes Chairman Mao's latest instructions unimplemented, and destroys Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Another said, with factionalism, a team is divided into several factions, you say east, he says west, do not consult each other, do not cooperate with each other, and cannot well grasp the revolution and promote production. Many people said, factionalism is also the air-raid shelter of the class enemy, the two factions fight "civil war," the capitalist-roaders are idle, the ghosts and snakes take the opportunity to make trouble, the class enemy is happy, we revolutionaries cannot afford to have factionalism anymore.

Everyone talked more and more about how evil factionalism is and more and more felt the need to quickly achieve revolutionary great unity. At this time, a leader from the "Bing Tuan" faction stood up and said loudly: "Since we poor and lower-middle peasants have no fundamental conflict of interest, why do we still sit separately?!" At this moment, the venue made a sound, and the people of "Dong Lian" and "Bing Tuan" sat together warmly. The original battlefield of "civil war" has now become a battlefield of self-criticism and fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

Many leaders of both factions also actively found their opponents, exposed their factionalism, fought their selfishness, and sought criticism and suggestions. The party branch secretary Liu Quan Sheng and the team leader Yang Guang of Tao Yuan Team are both old poor peasants with deep bitterness, and their relationship has always been good in the past; later, due to different views, they joined two combat teams. The "civil war" between the two factions became deeper, and their feelings also became more distant. They either argued red-faced and ears-red or did not say a word when they met, like enemies. This time, Liu Quan Sheng took the initiative to find Yang Guang, holding his hand, and painfully checked the harm of factionalism to him. Yang Guang also checked the serious impact of factionalism on himself. The great Mao Zedong Thought made these two class brothers who grew up together in bitterness reunite.

With the end of this major debate to suppress factionalism, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were implemented in the hearts of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, becoming a powerful force for achieving revolutionary great unity. Now, this commune, which used to be the most fierce in the "civil war" in Dong Gou County, including ten teams, seventy-four production teams, seven primary schools, as well as the supply and marketing departments and the commune's direct-affiliated organs, have all achieved revolutionary great unity according to the system and industry, taking the lead in the whole county. The revolution and production of the whole commune have presented a scene of hot and bustling.

    一场围剿派性的大辩论
    ——记新沟公社两大派革命群众组织落实毛主席最新指示、实现革命大联合的经过
    辽宁省丹东市东沟县新沟公社的革命群众，由于受走资派的挑动和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响，分成“东联”和“兵团”两派，“内战”一直打个不停。丹东驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，看到两派都是以贫农下中农为主体的革命群众组织，就把两派的头头邀集到一起，商量革命大联合的问题。不料刚坐到一起，两派头头就抓住对方的缺点进行攻击，而且无限上纲。“东联”派说：“你们组织中牛鬼蛇神一大帮，干的都是打、砸、抢，从头坏到脚，没有一点香，我们不能同你们坐在一条板凳上。”“兵团”派说：“我们同‘东联’是两条路线的斗争，搞联合就是阶级斗争熄灭论。”他们一连坐在一起谈了三次，双方都是气冲冲而来，轰它几炮就走。
      用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑
    面对这种僵局怎么办？宣传队同志坚信毛泽东思想威力无穷，坚信广大贫农下中农最听毛主席的话。他们一边向两派革命群众宣传毛主席的最新指示，一边邀集两派各战斗队的头头开讨论会，并请了一些苦大仇深的贫农下中农参加。
    讨论会刚开锣，“内战”的架势就摆开了。两派的头头一进会场，一派坐东边，一派坐西边，自然而然地分开了。“兵团”派的头头说：“今天咱们来个杨子荣赴宴，舌战小炉匠。”“东联”的头头也说：“不管他们耍什么花招，咱们来个孙猴子救唐僧，三打白骨精。”两派都分别在唧唧咕咕地研究对策。
    宣传队的同志毫不气馁，信心百倍地领着大家学习毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”学完以后，让大家讨论如何落实毛主席最新指示的问题。
    宣传队同志话音刚落，有人就忽地站起来说：
      “我看我们公社情况特殊，没法联合。”
    “这段话，是对工人讲的，并没说我们农民！”
    这话可气坏了坐在旁边的老贫农邢文奎。他站起来，气冲冲地说：
      “不对呵！毛主席他老人家的话，用到那里那里灵。难道我们贫下中农之间有根本的利害冲突吗？”
    邢文奎用自己的苦难经历，说明在旧社会地主是一样狠，天下穷人是一家的道理。另一个老贫农接上说：
      “要说有根本的利害冲突，那就是我们贫下中农跟走资派和地富反坏右的冲突。在我们贫下中农之间，压根儿就没有你死我活的问题。”
    贫下中农之间没有根本的利害冲突
    毛主席的教导，老贫农的话，对某些没有受过阶级苦的青年人来说，是一下子领会不了的。辩论继续进行下去。“兵团”派的两个青年人说：
      “邢大爷讲的那是旧社会，现在是新社会，情况变了。”
    老贫农杜连甫坚决不同意，他说：
      “什么变了？天变地变，贫下中农的阶级感情永远也不会变！土改那阵子，打地主，分田地，贫下中农团结得象一个人一样。那时俺们就是一个心眼，团结起来，打倒地主，彻底翻身。”
    宣城四队的老贫农万世祥接着说：
      “合作化那阵子，地主富农在一边冷笑，想看我们的笑话；富裕中农怕吃亏，不入社。就是咱们贫下中农响应毛主席的号召，成立了合作社。没有车就人背肩扛，没有牲口就用人拉犁，大伙儿心可齐了。合作化不久，中国赫鲁晓夫说什么社办多了，要解散。我们贫下中农才不散哩！我们和中国赫鲁晓夫那一小撮走资派是死对头，就是有根本的利害冲突。”
    三位老贫农的发言，把会场的辩论搞活了。大家你一言我一语议论开了。这个说：“说得对，一点不假，一想起旧社会，咱们贫下中农那个齐心劲，打心眼里高兴。”那个说：“利害！利害！旧社会利的都是地主，害的都是贫下中农。咱们穷哥儿们有啥利害冲突呀？”
      分裂的祸根在中国赫鲁晓夫身上
    会开到这儿，两派战斗队的头头们都开始冷静下来，回忆着无产阶级文化大革命一年多来的斗争历程。有人禁不住提出这样一个问题：
    “既然我们没有根本的利害冲突，为什么在无产阶级文化大革命中会分成两派，象冤家对头一样？”
    这一问，使大家重新议论开来，都举手争着发言。他们说：“文化大革命开始，我们贫下中农根本没有这个派，那个派，是中国赫鲁晓夫为了保自己，保其他的走资派和牛鬼蛇神，抛出了资产阶级反动路线，挑动群众斗群众，拉一帮，打一帮，才把我们分成了两派，这个祸根完全在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。”
    但是，有人继续提出问题：“这个我懂！可是，为什么对有些事情，我这一派赞成，你那一派要反对？比如对一些革命干部，为什么一个要革，一个要保呢？”
    话音未落，马上就有人站了起来，首先念了“十六条”中的一段话：“人民群众中有不同意见，这是正常的现象。几种不同意见的争论，是不可免的，是必要的，是有益的。群众会在正常的充分的辩论中，肯定正确，改正错误，逐步取得一致。”然后，他接着说，对某些事情，对某些干部，我们的看法不一致，这是正常现象；本来，只要我们遵照毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”办事，遵照毛主席的最新指示办事，摆事实，讲道理，我们的看法是完全可以协商统一起来的。可是，为什么我们要争个你死我活呢？
    一连串的问题，引起了大家的深思，打开了大家的心窍。会场上议论纷纷，许多人都在自问自答：“为什么我们不能按‘十六条’办事？毛主席的最新指示为什么不能落实？为什么我们自己的内部问题谈不拢？这就是私心挡道，派性作怪。”慢慢大家得出了一致的结论：“一千个矛盾，一万个矛盾，同党内一小撮走资派是最大的矛盾；这个利害冲突，那个利害冲突，社会主义道路和资本主义道路才是最根本的利害冲突；你说你有理，我说我有理，不斗私批修，不打倒派性，就不合毛泽东思想的大道理。”
      打倒派性，在斗争中
        实现革命大联合
    会越开越热烈，发言的人更多了，气氛也更活跃了。大家你一言我一语，开始了对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的大围剿。这个说，派性就是坏，蒙住了我们的眼，搅乱了我们的心，使毛主席最新指示不能落实，破坏了毛主席的伟大战略部署。那个说，有了派性，一个队分成好几帮，你说东，他道西，不互相商量，不互相协作，就不能很好地抓革命促生产。许多人都说，派性更是阶级敌人的防空洞，两派打“内战”，走资派清闲，牛鬼蛇神乘机捣乱，阶级敌人喜欢，我们革命派可不能再闹派性了。
    大家越谈越觉得派性可恶，越谈越感到必须尽快实现革命的大联合。正在这时候，“兵团”一位头头站起来大声说道：“既然我们贫下中农之间没有根本利害冲突，为什么还要分开坐呢？！”这时候，会场上哗啦一声，“东联”和“兵团”的人都亲亲热热地坐到一起去了。原来是打“内战”的战场，现在变成了自我批评、斗私批修的战场。
    两派的许多头头，还主动找到对方，亮派性，斗私心，征求批评意见。桃园大队党支部书记刘全胜和大队长杨光，都是苦大仇深的老贫农，过去关系一直很好；后来由于观点不同，参加了两个战斗队。两派的“内战”越打越深，他们的感情也越离越远，见了面不是争个面红耳赤，就是一句话不说，好似仇人一样。这次，刘全胜主动找到杨光，握着他的手，痛心地检查派性对他的毒害。杨光也检查了派性对自己的严重影响。伟大的毛泽东思想使这两个一起从苦水里长大的阶级兄弟，重新团结在一起。
    随着这一场围剿派性的大辩论的结束，毛主席的最新指示落实到了广大贫下中农的心坎上，成了实现革命大联合的强大动力。现在，这个从前在东沟县打
  “内战”打得最凶的公社，包括十个大队、七十四个生产队、七所小学，以及供销部门、公社直属机关等，都按系统、按行业实现了革命大联合，在全县领了先。全公社的革命和生产出现了一片热气腾腾的景象。
