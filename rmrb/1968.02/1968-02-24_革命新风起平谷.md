Recently, we visited Pinggu County in the suburbs of Beijing. A wave of revolutionary new spirit greeted us, refreshing our ears and eyes.

In the offices of the County Revolutionary Committee, there were few people to be seen. Most comrades had gone to the grassroots to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The County Revolutionary Committee director went to the deep mountains seventy miles away to visit a production brigade. The commune focused on the ideological revolutionization of people, placing the leadership of the revolution in the first position. The leadership of the production brigades actively took the initiative, vigorously promoting the revolution and rapidly advancing production. Every household was engaged in upholding Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fiercely criticizing the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary situation was excellent, and the production outlook was flourishing.

After the establishment of the County Revolutionary Committee, how was the work of the entire county to be done well? How did the commune and production brigade grassroots leadership carry the double burden of revolution and production? The answer from Pinggu County comrades was: the most fundamental thing is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and achieve ideological revolutionization. Only in this way can Chairman Mao's various instructions be quickly implemented and turned into the actual actions of the revolutionary masses. Let us take a look at several aspects of the new revolutionary spirit in Pinggu County!

Above or Below?

One day, we visited the Pinggu County Agricultural Representatives Congress. In the narrow room that served as both an office and a dormitory, a young commissioner in his twenties talked to us about the situation of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. He spoke vividly, lively, and very specifically. When we asked how he knew these details, it turned out that he was the brigade leader of a production team in Nan Dulehe Commune and a commissioner of the County Agricultural Representatives Congress. What he talked about was all his own experience.

Here, the County Agricultural Representatives Congress adopted a system where commissioners took turns on duty, rotating every ten days, with three to four people each time. The Agricultural Representatives Congress had a total of thirty commissioners, each on duty once every hundred days on average. Standing committee members were on duty for a longer period. Usually, these commissioners all went to the lower levels, studying and working with the commune members together. Some were brigade leaders, some were production brigade leaders, or held other positions. The daily affairs of the Agricultural Representatives Congress were handled by the on-duty comrades. We asked, "What are the benefits of doing this?"

"The benefits for the revolutionization of the organs and the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions are immense," was their response.

Indeed, to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, one must first combine them with actual conditions and target the active thoughts of the masses, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as arrows to hit the target of active thoughts. Chairman Mao said, "Shooting arrows requires looking at the target, playing the piano requires looking at the audience." If one does not understand the situation below or is only vaguely aware, how can one shoot without missing and hit the target? The commissioners of the Agricultural Representatives Congress spend nine-tenths of their time on the production frontline with the masses. They use one-tenth of their time to come to the county for duty, bringing a large amount of active thoughts and reflecting the fresh and lively struggle reality. If they all stayed at home or most of them stayed at home, listening to reports and making phone calls, it would never replace the firsthand materials obtained through personal experience.

A commissioner told us that to truly become a representative of the masses, one must first do a good job in their own unit. Therefore, these commissioners at the grassroots level have all created new experiences. A commissioner of the Municipal Agricultural Representatives Congress and deputy head of the core group of the County Agricultural Representatives Congress, Comrade Zhang Fengying, told us that the comrades on duty were not just sitting in the office answering phones; they also went down to find typical examples and spread experiences. Therefore, an Agricultural Representatives Congress with thirty commissioners sometimes couldn't find anyone.

The situation of the Agricultural Representatives Congress taking turns on duty can be said to be a microcosm of the work of the Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee organs. Comrades in many other departments also took turns going down.

Focus on Affairs or Focus on Fundamentals?

We arrived at Wang Xin Zhuang Commune and felt that the revolutionary atmosphere here was very strong. Every village had set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and everyone was engaged in a revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev.

On the first day of the establishment of the Wang Xin Zhuang Commune Revolutionary Committee, many affairs were presented. Issues such as year-end distribution and land problems needed to be addressed. What should be done? Some commissioners were eager to handle these affairs, as if the sky would fall if they didn't. The director of the Commune Revolutionary Committee thought that they must learn from past lessons and first focus on the fundamentals—studying Mao Zedong Thought. Immediately, everyone agreed with this opinion and held a four-day study class.

During these four days, they seriously studied Mao Zedong Thought. Among them, they discussed the six characters of Chairman Mao's instruction "Revolutionary Committees are good" for a whole day. They concluded two points. First, the Revolutionary Committee must be revolutionary, and it must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Second, the Revolutionary Committee must lead the revolution and the revolutionization of people's thoughts. It must use 100% of its time and 100% of its energy to study, propagate, execute, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the leadership of the Commune Revolutionary Committee, brigades and production teams all prioritized the study of Mao Zedong Thought. Bei Tai Brigade is a vivid example. Mao Zedong Thought has deeply entered the hearts of the people, revolutionary criticism is carried out in every household, and everyone is spirited. The director of the Brigade Revolutionary Committee told us, "In the past, we focused on production and the production was not good. Now we focus on politics, on fundamentals, on Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and the production is better than ever."

Facts show that if one focuses on trivial matters and only deals with affairs, the more one deals with them, the more chaotic they become, like a tangled mess that cannot be untangled. On the contrary, if one first focuses on the fundamentals, on the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, on the study of Mao Zedong Thought, and on ideological revolutionization, all problems will be solved smoothly. In summary, if one deals with affairs from a political and ideological perspective, one can achieve twice the results with half the effort.

Wait or Act Immediately?

We walked to Hongshimen Brigade of Kaoshan Commune and saw a moving scene. The Mao Zedong quotations boards at the edge of the field here were made of large blue stone slabs. These large stone slabs weighed over two hundred pounds each and were carried here by the local youth from far away. From this, one can see how much the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongshimen love Chairman Mao!

Because the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongshimen have deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, they can quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Last year on National Day, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade heard from the radio that Comrade Lin Biao conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "We must struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." They were very happy and said it was "timely rain."

At that time, the Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee and Kaoshan Commune had not arranged for the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. What should be done? Some suggested waiting to see how the higher authorities would arrange it? The brigade leadership comrades said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the action guidelines for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country, and they should be conveyed as soon as possible without any delay. After discussion, they immediately set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Thus, the Mao Zedong Thought study class of Hongshimen Brigade became the earliest one in the entire commune, and even in the entire county. Because they quickly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, struggled against selfishness well, and criticized revisionism deeply, good things happened every day, and good people were praised everywhere. People called Hongshimen "a world of public spirit."

There are indeed many tasks that need to wait for the higher authorities to arrange and require unified action. However, for Chairman Mao's latest instructions, acting immediately and responding quickly to implement them and see results is the characteristic of the proletarian revolutionary faction. The brigade leadership of Hongshimen only competed for time and showed an active spirit, fully embodying this characteristic.

The comrades of Hongshimen felt that for Chairman Mao's latest instructions, all levels of leadership organs should follow closely and quickly arrange for implementation. Lower-level organs should also act according to the arrangements of the higher-level leadership organs. However, lower-level organs, especially grassroots units, must not have the thought of relying solely on higher-level arrangements; they must act immediately upon hearing the instructions. Even if the higher-level organs later have arrangements, they can combine them with specific situations and further implement them. That would be fine. They said, if it is about arrangements, isn't Chairman Mao issuing the latest instructions directly arranging for us? Is there any arrangement more important than this? Therefore, for the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grassroots units should fully exert their initiative, which is consistent with respecting the leadership of higher-level organs and has no contradiction.

Actively and proactively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a revolutionary new spirit worth promoting. After the director of the County Revolutionary Committee went to Hongshimen and discovered this matter, he praised them. He told us, "The style of Hongshimen is a manifestation of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and a manifestation of ideological revolutionization. We support their proactive spirit in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions."

    革命新风起平谷
    最近，我们来到北京郊区平谷县访问。阵阵革命化新风，迎面而来，令人耳目一新。
    县革命委员会的机关里，看不到几个人，大部分同志都到基层去落实毛主席最新指示去了。县革命委员会主任到七十里外的深山里，去访问生产队。公社狠抓人的思想革命化，把领导革命放在第一位。生产大队的领导班子积极发挥主动性，狠抓革命，猛促生产。村村户户都在大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线。革命形势一片大好，生产气象欣欣向荣。
    县革命委员会成立以后，怎样抓好全县的工作？公社、生产大队基层领导班子，又怎样挑好革命和生产两副重担？平谷县同志的答案是：最根本一条是用毛泽东思想武装自己，实现思想革命化。只有这样，才能迅速把毛主席的各项指示落实下去，化为革命群众的实际行动。让我们来看看平谷县的革命新风的几个侧面吧！
    在上面，还是在下面？
    一天，我们到平谷县农代会访问。在办公室和宿舍两用的狭小房间里，一个二十岁上下的年青的委员，同我们谈了举办毛泽东思想学习班的情况。他谈得既生动，又活泼，非常具体。我们问他是怎样了解这些情况的？原来，他是南独乐河公社的一个生产队的队长、县农代会委员。他谈的，都是他自己做的。
    这里的县农代会采取委员轮流值班制度，每十天轮换一次，每次三、四人不等。农代会一共有三十名委员，每人平均一百天里值班一次。常委值班的时间长一些。平时，这些委员都到下边去，同社员一起学习，一起劳动，有的当生产队长，有的当生产大队长，或担任其他职务。农代会的日常事务，就由值班的同志来管。我们问：“这样做有什么好处？”
    “这对于机关革命化和落实毛主席最新指示，都有很大好处。”这是他们的回答。
    事实正是如此。要落实毛主席的最新指示，首先必须结合实际，针对群众中的活思想，以毛主席最新指示为矢，去射活思想之的。毛主席说：“射箭要看靶子，弹琴要看听众”。如果不了解下情，或者若明若暗，那又怎么能箭无虚发，击中要害？农代会的委员，平常有十分之九的时间在生产第一线，同群众在一起。他们用十分之一的时间到县里来值班，便带来了大量的活思想，把新鲜活泼的斗争实际反映上来。如果都坐在家里，或者大部分坐在家里，听汇报，打电话，那是怎么也不能代替亲身经历的第一手材料的。
    一个委员告诉我们，要真正成为群众的代表，就一定首先要把自己所在的单位搞好。所以，这些委员在基层都创造了新的经验。市农代会委员、县农代会核心组副组长张凤英同志告诉我们，平常值班的同志并不是只坐在办公室守电话，也下去跑，发现典型，传播经验。所以，有三十个委员的农代会，有时竟找不到人。
    农代会轮流值班的情况，可以说是平谷县革命委员会机关工作的一个缩影。其他许多部门的同志，也这样轮流下去。
    抓事务，还是抓根本？
    我们到了王辛庄公社，感到这里革命化气氛很浓。村村都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，人人都对中国赫鲁晓夫展开革命大批判。
    在王辛庄公社革命委员会成立的第一天，许多事务就摆在面前了。什么年终分配呀，房基地问题呀，等等。怎么办呢？有些委员就急着要去抓事务，仿佛不抓，天就塌下来。公社革命委员会主任想到，必须接受过去的教训，首先要抓根本——学习毛泽东思想。当下，大家一致同意这个意见，办了四天学习班。
    在这四天当中，他们认真学习了毛泽东思想。其中，单是毛主席的指示“革命委员会好”这六个字，就讨论了一天。他们讨论的结果，明白了两条道理。第一，革命委员会必须是革命的，要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。第二，革命委员会必须是领导革命的，领导人的思想革命化的。它要用百分之百的时间，百分之百的精力，来学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，执行毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想。
    在公社革命委员会的领导下，大队、生产队都把学习毛泽东思想放在首位。北台大队就是一个生动的例证，毛泽东思想深入人心，革命大批判户户开展，个个精神振奋。大队革命委员会主任告诉我们：“往年埋头抓生产，生产也不怎么样。现在抓政治，抓根本，抓毛泽东思想学习班，生产比哪年都强。”
    事实说明，舍本逐末，只抓事务，就事务抓事务，结果越抓越乱，越抓越多，仿佛乱麻一样扯不开。相反，首先去抓根本，抓毛主席最新指示的落实，抓毛泽东思想的学习，抓思想革命化，什么问题都迎刃而解。总之，从政治上思想上来抓事务问题，那就能事半功倍。
    等一等，还是闻风而动？
    我们走到靠山集公社红石门大队，看到了一幅感人的景象。这里地头的毛主席语录牌，都是青色的大石片。这些大石片，重的有二百多斤，都是这里的青年人从远处背来的。就从这件事可以看到，红石门广大贫下中农多么热爱毛主席呵！
    正因为红石门广大贫下中农对毛主席有深厚的阶级感情，他们就能迅速落实毛主席最新指示。去年国庆节，这个大队的贫下中农从广播中听到了林彪同志传达毛主席的最新指示：“要斗私，批修”。他们非常高兴，都说这是“及时雨”。
    这时，平谷县革命委员会和靠山集公社都没有布置学习毛主席的最新指示。怎么办呢？有人主张等一等，看看上级怎么布置？大队领导班子的同志们说：毛主席的最新指示，是我们全党、全军、全国的行动纲领，传达得越早越好，不能有半刻迟延。经过研究，马上就办起了毛泽东思想学习班，进行斗私批修。这样，红石门大队的毛泽东思想学习班，就成为全公社，以至全县各大队中最早的一个。由于他们迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，斗私斗得好，批修批得深，好事天天有，好人处处夸，人们把红石门称做“公字天下”。
    有许多工作，当然要等上级机关布置，并且要求统一行动。但是，对于毛主席的最新指示，闻风而动，迅速响应，务求落实，见诸效果，这是无产阶级革命派应有的本色。红石门大队只争朝夕的主动精神，就充分体现了这种本色。
    红石门的同志的体会是：对于毛主席的最新指示，各级领导机关都应当紧跟，都要迅速布置贯彻，下级机关也应按照上级领导机关的布置去做。但是，下级机关，特别是基层单位，绝不能抱着单纯依赖上级布置的思想，必须闻风而动，立即执行。即使以后上级机关有布置，可以结合具体情况，再进一步贯彻执行，那又有什么不好呢？他们说，要说是布置，毛主席发出最新指示，不就是毛主席直接向我们布置吗？还有什么布置比这个更重要的呢？所以，对于落实毛主席最新指示，基层单位充分发挥主动性，同尊重上级机关的领导，是一致的，没有矛盾的。
    积极主动落实毛主席最新指示，是很值得提倡的革命化新风。县革命委员会主任到了红石门，发现了这个事情以后，就表扬了他们。他告诉我们说：“红石门的作风，是无限忠于毛主席的表现，是思想革命化的表现。我们支持他们落实毛主席最新指示的主动精神。”
