The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "We must economize to make revolution." This is not merely an economic issue; it is an integral part of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The current situation is excellent. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are being gradually implemented. However, class struggle remains sharp and complex. One of the important forms of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat is economic corruption. We must elevate economic issues to a political level.

Is it to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions of "frugal nation-building" and "economizing to make revolution," to practice thrift and oppose waste; or is it to flaunt wealth, indulge in extravagance, and waste resources? This is not a small matter but a major issue of struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. It is a big issue concerning whether the proletarian revolutionary faction can properly exercise power and whether the proletarian dictatorship will change color.

The proletarian revolutionary faction must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle." The important content and specific manifestations of class struggle at present are to thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and to oppose anarchism. Only by intensifying class struggle can we fully implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "economizing to make revolution."

For every proletarian revolutionary, whether one can persist in economizing to make revolution is a test of whether one can win the battle against sugar-coated bullets and become a proletarian revolutionary who is forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

Increasing production is the greatest form of economy. We must adhere to the policy of "frugal nation-building," fully mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the workers, strive to increase production and income, and continuously create wealth for the country.

Let us launch a new high tide of the production and economy movement, thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, strive to be models of "grasping revolution and promoting production," models of economizing to make revolution, and models of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

A newswire from Shanghai, February 27th: The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held an expanded meeting on the 26th, deciding to fully implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "economizing to make revolution" from the ideological, organizational, and all aspects, and to launch a mass movement of increasing production, increasing income, opposing waste, and practicing thrift.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, responsible personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, and responsible personnel of various levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations attended the meeting.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao presided over the meeting and delivered an important speech. He pointed out that to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must implement them in every aspect, repeatedly, and earnestly from the ideological, political, economic, and organizational perspectives. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "We must economize to make revolution." This is not merely an economic issue; it is an integral part of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Various levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instruction.

Representatives from various fronts spoke at the meeting. Everyone agreed that the current situation in Shanghai is excellent, and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are being gradually implemented. Revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones have further solidified and developed. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has further expanded and deepened, and people's spiritual outlook has been completely renewed, with new people and new things emerging continuously. However, class struggle remains sharp and complex, and one of the important forms of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat is economic corruption.

The meeting believed that whether to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions of "frugal nation-building" and "economizing to make revolution," to practice thrift and oppose waste; or to flaunt wealth, indulge in extravagance, and waste resources, is not a small matter but a major issue of struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. It is a big issue concerning whether the proletarian revolutionary faction can properly exercise power and whether the proletarian dictatorship will change color. Shanghai was once a city where bourgeois forces were concentrated. Before liberation, one of the methods the class enemy used to attack the proletariat was economic corruption. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party spread the counter-revolutionary economism wind, attempting to sabotage the economy and production to sabotage the Cultural Revolution. Today, the enemy is still using this method to attack us, attempting to corrupt the proletarian revolutionary faction with this method. The proletarian revolutionary faction must be a hundred times more vigilant, maintain and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of thrift, and keep the proletarian dictatorship evergreen.

The meeting required various levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations to always remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle." The meeting pointed out that the important content and specific manifestations of class struggle at present are to thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, to overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and to oppose anarchism. Only by intensifying class struggle can we fully implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "economizing to make revolution."

Everyone at the meeting criticized several erroneous thoughts currently existing. Everyone pointed out that some people think that economizing to make revolution is the business of the financial department and banks, "none of my business"; some people use the excuse of settling political accounts to oppose settling economic accounts, etc. These views are all wrong. Currently, the class enemy is attacking us economically, and we must elevate economic accounts to a political level. Practicing thrift is not just about saving a few dollars; it is a big matter concerning which road we take and the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship. For every proletarian revolutionary, whether one can persist in economizing to make revolution is also a severe test, testing whether one can win the battle against sugar-coated bullets and become a proletarian revolutionary who is forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The meeting believed that increasing production is the greatest form of economy. Various factories and enterprises, in the process of earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions of "frugal nation-building" and "economizing to make revolution," must strive to increase production and income. Everyone said that our country is a poor and blank country, and we must adhere to the policy of "frugal nation-building," fully mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the workers, strive to increase production and income, and continuously create wealth for the country. The meeting introduced several advanced units that have achieved remarkable results in adhering to production and economy, and required everyone to learn from them. For example, the Shanghai Sports Equipment Factory No. 4 increased its output value by 19% compared to 1966, increased its output by 9%, and reduced its cost by 2%. All the indicators it completed last year broke the historical records of the factory. The Shanghai Fifth Department Store's commodity turnover last year increased by 32% compared to 1966, while the cost level dropped by 25.4%.

The meeting also discussed how to thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, eliminate extravagance and waste, economize on various exhibitions, economize on business and travel expenses, and streamline the number of full-time personnel in mass organizations, and proposed specific measures.

On the 27th, the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai responded to the call of the expanded meeting of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, held a "Highly Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Further Economize to Make Revolution" oath-taking meeting, determined to launch a new high tide of the production and economy movement, thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, strive to be models of "grasping revolution and promoting production," models of economizing to make revolution, and models of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    上海市革委会扩大会议要求各级革委会和各革命群众组织狠抓阶级斗争
    全面落实毛主席要节约闹革命伟大指示
    充分发动群众在经济领域中打好政治仗
    张春桥同志作了重要讲话。广大革命职工决心掀起增产节约运动新高潮
    内容提要
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们“要节约闹革命”，这决不仅仅是一个经济问题，而是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的组成部分。
    当前形势大好，毛主席的一系列最新指示正在逐步落实。但是阶级斗争仍然尖锐复杂，而从经济上进行腐蚀，是当前资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一个重要形式。我们要把经济账提高到政治高度来看。
    是坚决贯彻毛主席“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，厉行节约，反对浪费；还是讲排场、摆阔气，铺张浪费？这不是小问题，而是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大问题，是关系到无产阶级革命派能不能掌好权、用好权，关系到无产阶级政权变不变色的大问题。
    无产阶级革命派要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导。当前阶级斗争的重要内容和具体表现，就是肃清反革命经济主义流毒，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，反对无政府主义。只有狠抓阶级斗争，才能全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示。
    对每个无产阶级革命派来说，能不能坚持节约闹革命，是考验我们能不能在糖衣炮弹面前打胜仗，做永远忠于毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。
    增加生产是最大的节约。我们一定要坚持“勤俭建国”的方针，充分调动职工的社会主义积极性，努力增加生产，增加收入，不断为国家创造财富。
    掀起增产节约的群众运动新高潮，彻底肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，争当“抓革命，促生产”的模范，争当节约闹革命的模范，争当全面落实毛主席最新指示的模范，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    新华社上海二十七日电　上海市革命委员会二十六日举行扩大会议，决定从思想上、组织上全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示，掀起增加生产，增加收入，反对浪费，厉行节约的群众运动。
    上海市革命委员会领导成员，人民解放军驻上海部队负责人，各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织负责人出席了会议。
    张春桥同志主持了会议，并作了重要讲话。他指出，全面落实毛主席最新指示，就要条条落实，反复落实，要从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上各个方面认真落实。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们“要节约闹革命”，这决不仅仅是一个经济问题，而是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的组成部分。各级革命委员会、各革命群众组织应当认真抓好毛主席这一指示的落实。
    各条战线上的代表纷纷在会上发言。大家认为，当前上海形势大好，毛主席的一系列最新指示正在逐步落实。革命大联合、革命三结合有了进一步的巩固和发展。活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动有了更广泛深入的发展，人的精神面貌焕然一新，新人新事层出不穷。但是，阶级斗争仍然尖锐复杂，而从经济上进行腐蚀，是当前资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一个重要形式。
    会议认为，是坚决贯彻毛主席“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示，厉行节约，反对浪费；还是讲排场、摆阔气，铺张浪费？这不是小问题，而是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大问题，是关系到无产阶级革命派能不能掌好权、用好权，关系到无产阶级政权变不变色的大问题。上海曾经是资产阶级势力集中的城市，解放以前，阶级敌人向无产阶级进攻的手法之一就是经济腐蚀。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资派刮起反革命经济主义妖风，就是企图用破坏经济、破坏生产的办法来破坏文化大革命。今天，敌人还在用这种形式向我们进攻，妄图用这种办法来腐蚀无产阶级革命派。无产阶级革命派必须百倍提高警惕，保持和发扬勤俭节约的革命精神，使无产阶级政权永葆青春。
    会议要求各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导。会议指出，当前阶级斗争的重要内容和具体表现，就是肃清反革命经济主义流毒，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，反对无政府主义。只有狠抓阶级斗争，才能全面落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示。
    大家在会上批判了当前存在的几种错误思想。大家指出，有人认为节约闹革命是财政部门和银行的事，“与我无关”；有人借口要算政治账，反对算经济账等等，这些看法都是错误的。当前阶级敌人从经济上向我们进攻，我们就是要把经济账提高到政治高度来看。厉行节约，不仅仅是节省几个钱的问题，这是关系到我们走什么道路的问题，是巩固无产阶级政权的大事。对每个无产阶级革命派来说，能不能坚持节约闹革命，也是一个严峻的考验，考验我们能不能在糖衣炮弹面前打胜仗，做永远忠于毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    会议认为，增加生产是最大的节约。各工厂、企业在认真落实毛主席“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”伟大指示的过程中，更要努力增加生产，增加收入。大家说，我国是一个一穷二白的国家，我们一定要坚持“勤俭建国”的方针，充分调动职工的社会主义积极性，努力增加生产，增加收入，不断为国家创造财富。会上介绍了一些坚持增产节约取得显著成绩的先进单位，要求大家向他们学习。如上海体育器材四厂，去年产值比一九六六年增长了百分之十九，产量增长了百分之九，而成本降低了百分之二，去年完成的各项指标都打破了这个厂历史上的纪录。上海市第五百货商店去年的商品流转量比一九六六年增加百分之三十二，而费用水平却下降了百分之二十五点四。
    会上，还对如何肃清反革命经济主义流毒，消除铺张浪费现象，节约办各种展览会，节约事业费、旅差费支出，精简群众组织脱产人员等问题进行了讨论，并且提出了具体措施。
    二十七日，上海广大革命职工响应市革命委员会扩大会议的号召，举行了“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步节约闹革命誓师大会”，决心掀起增产节约的群众运动新高潮，彻底肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，争当“抓革命，促生产”的模范，争当节约闹革命的模范，争当全面落实毛主席最新指示的模范，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
