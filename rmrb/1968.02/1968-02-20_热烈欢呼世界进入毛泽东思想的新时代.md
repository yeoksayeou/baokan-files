In the past year, revolutionary people from more than 120 countries and regions wrote tens of thousands of letters to the Central People's Broadcasting Station. They used the most sincere language to unanimously praise Chairman Mao as the "greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time," the "great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander of the world's revolutionary people," and the "red sun that shines brightly in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people." They enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Chairman Mao is the great leader and helmsman of our era

The heroic people of Albania expressed their deepest proletarian feelings and highest respect for the great helmsman of our era, Chairman Mao, in their letters. One letter said, "We Albanian people will forever love Chairman Mao, our closest comrade-in-arms and the great leader beloved by the people of the world." A Finnish friend wrote in a letter, "Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all the revolutionary people of the world." Australian listener Singh wrote in a letter, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, warming our hearts and illuminating our path forward." Guinean listener Jean Mark wrote a poem praising Chairman Mao. In the first eleven lines of the poem, the first letter of each line in French spells out the three bright red characters "Mao Zedong":

	I envy the people of China,
	Ah! Great leader,
	It is you who save the suffering world.
	You are the helmsman of the revolution,
	You are the wise teacher, the people of the world listen to your voice,
	You support the sufferers, awakening those who are asleep.
	You are the leader and teacher guiding them to happiness,
	You have made the road to liberation even broader,
	You have united all revolutionary fighters under the banner of your thought,
	You have smashed the countless evil plots of the enemies of the revolution,
	You have defended the people's cause, protecting it from the destruction of internal and external enemies.
	Long live Chairman Mao, the lighthouse of the people of the world!
	Long live Chairman Mao, the protector of a bright future!
	Many listeners expressed their strong desire to visit China and see Chairman Mao in person. They said, "To see the greatest leader of our time, Chairman Mao, and to shake hands with him would be the greatest happiness of my life." Countless letters from all over the world earnestly requested Mao badges and photographs of Chairman Mao. A Nigerian friend said that after obtaining a Mao badge, he "sits looking at it, stands looking at it, and even holds it high above his head to express my boundless respect for Chairman Mao." Many listeners in the African region specially collected photographs of Chairman Mao and of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and treasured these photographs. An Austrian listener who had visited China wrote in a poem praising Chairman Mao:

	Noble is his thought;
	Great are his achievements;
	His iron will is forever advancing.
	He, with a red sun in his heart,
	Is guiding the people of the world to realize their noble ideals.

Fighting and sacrificing for the great leader Chairman Mao

The revolutionary people of the world admire and enthusiastically praise the great savior of humanity, Chairman Mao, who is holding high the banner of world revolution, leading the oppressed peoples and nations to engage in a head-on struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. A British listener wrote in a letter: The one leading the Chinese people in the great class struggle against the bourgeoisie and revisionism, which has great historical significance, is the most outstanding people's leader in the world, Mao Zedong. He is also guiding all the people of the world in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism. A listener from Algeria, signing as "A Revolutionary," said: Chairman Mao is the greatest flag-bearer of communism in our time. He has exposed the true face of the false communists, especially the revisionist groups of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and others. "The revolutionary people of the world all love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the red sun of the five continents and four seas." A Moroccan friend's words in a letter expressed the common voice of the world's revolutionary people.

Revolutionary people from various countries enthusiastically hailed the world entering the new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. They fully reflected in their letters that in various parts of the world, the vast revolutionary people studying the works of Chairman Mao has become an irresistible trend. More and more revolutionary people are eager to learn Mao Zedong Thought, strive to study it, actively propagate it, and seriously apply it. Australian listener Aspinunu pointed out: "The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is a great revolutionary banner. We must hold it high and let it fly all over the world."

The Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcasts the invincible Mao Zedong Thought day and night, especially after launching the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Selections from Chairman Mao's Works" programs, which have been warmly welcomed by overseas listeners. They regard the red waves from Beijing as their best school of Mao Zedong Thought. A West German listener who has long been listening to the broadcasts of the Central People's Broadcasting Station sent a eulogy titled "Our Leader and Savior Mao Zedong," enthusiastically writing: "Ah, great leader Mao Zedong, your thought saves the world from suffering. We stand by your side, expressing our loyalty to you, fighting and sacrificing for you. Your thought's sunlight illuminates the hearts of the oppressed people, your thought guides them towards liberation.... You, the victor and leader of the world, great Mao Zedong!"

The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will forever shine upon the world

Revolutionaries from various countries have been sending letters to request the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They call Mao's teachings "priceless treasures" and "red swords." A Finnish middle school student told the Central People's Broadcasting Station: "A classmate of mine got a copy of the red treasure book, but there are more than thirty students in our class and over a thousand students in the school, and many people want to study Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, I request that you send me some of those famous red treasure books." A fourteen-year-old blind American wrote in Braille to request "Quotations from Chairman Mao." A twenty-year-old Soviet girl risked the white terror to write to the Central People's Broadcasting Station: "Please send me the Russian edition of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.'" Listeners from various countries, after obtaining the works of Chairman Mao, studied them eagerly. Those who could not obtain the red treasure book listened to the broadcasts of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, recorded, and collected them over a long period, accumulating them into volumes, studying and applying them at any time. Many listeners wrote to the Central People's Broadcasting Station with sincere and moving reflections after studying the red treasure book. A comrade from the Vietnamese People's Army wrote in a letter: The Vietnamese people, thanks to the spiritual and material assistance provided by the Communist Party of China, the government of China, and the people of China, especially the study of Mao Zedong Thought, have become even more courageous and tenacious in battle. A cadre from a Vietnamese commune wrote in a letter: On the forward path, whenever I encounter difficulties and obstacles, I think of the teachings of the great teacher and beloved leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao. His teachings are like a lighthouse shining brightly in the vast sea. Whether in stormy weather or when the sky is filled with clouds, the light of the lighthouse always shines in all directions. A friend from Congo (Brazzaville) pointed out: Today, we are in the invincible era of Mao Zedong Thought. No force in the world can make us yield. Under the inspiration of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary Africa resolutely fights to the end against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys.

The trend of studying the works of Chairman Mao is irresistible

According to letters from listeners in various countries, revolutionaries in many regions of the world have established study groups for the works of Chairman Mao, revolutionary groups, or other progressive organizations. They actively engage in propaganda activities and revolutionary struggles based on the teachings of Chairman Mao. A member of a progressive organization in West Germany wrote: "We are a group of young workers and students in West Germany. We strive to strengthen our study of Marxism-Leninism and the works of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, which have developed Marxism-Leninism, and we are determined to make our due contribution to the speedy demise of American imperialism and its lackeys." This organization decided to apply what they have learned to practice, so that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and progressive intellectuals can grasp Mao Zedong Thought. A revolutionary group in a city district of West Germany set its main task as: "Spreading and distributing the works of the great helmsman and leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and hanging up the quotation boards of the contemporary supreme commander and greatest Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao Zedong." The leader of another revolutionary group in West Germany said: "Our most important work is to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong." In Africa, there are also many organizations studying the works of Chairman Mao. A Mao Zedong Thought library in Nigeria, to meet the demands of a wide range of readers, further enriched the library and wrote to the Central People's Broadcasting Station, earnestly requesting help. Some countries and regions have also established Beijing Radio Listening Clubs, whose primary tasks are also to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

Walking the revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao for a lifetime

In many countries, copying, reciting, and distributing the quotations of Chairman Mao have become a common practice. More and more revolutionary people, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "organizing the masses and propagating to the masses," frequently propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the surrounding masses and distribute the works of Chairman Mao. A staff member of an organization in the broad plains of Vietnam often goes deep into the frontline trenches, reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the self-defense forces who are closely monitoring the invading enemy and hunting down American air pirates. He wrote in a letter: "What is the most precious thing we have in our day and night battles against the enemy under the rain of bullets? It is our priceless treasure, 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' Now, as I write this letter, the self-defense forces guarding the trenches are still deeply engrossed in studying 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' They pass it from hand to hand, everyone copies and recites it, because they all regard this treasure book as an indispensable spiritual food for every day." A British middle school student told the Central People's Broadcasting Station in a letter about a story: "Hundreds of ordinary workers have developed a keen interest in the works of Chairman Mao. During the holidays, I worked in a carpet factory. When the workers there knew that I had a copy of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' many people asked me if I could lend it to them. Although I was very reluctant to part with this book—my most precious treasure—I still lent it to them. Many workers then took turns copying the quotations of Chairman Mao. They all wanted to copy one so that they could study it frequently." Broad progressive listeners from abroad all say: "Reading Chairman Mao's books is like hearing Chairman Mao's voice." "Chairman Mao's books, we will read them for a lifetime; Chairman Mao's words, we will listen to them for a lifetime; The revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao, we will walk it for a lifetime."

Holding high the banner of the great era and advancing bravely

In countries under reactionary rule, revolutionaries and progressive listeners face various restrictions and even persecution to read Chairman Mao's books, but they are fearless and persist in pursuing truth. A friend from a Southeast Asian country said: "No matter how great the risk, even if we are accused and imprisoned, we will still insist on studying. It is like this now and will be like this in the future." An employee from another Southeast Asian country was fired for studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, but he firmly believed that Chairman Mao's teachings are the truth, so he fearlessly fought back against the reactionaries who persecuted him. He wrote in a letter: Recently, these reactionaries tried to frame him again, and he might be arrested and imprisoned, but "I have Chairman Mao in my heart, I am not afraid of anything. The teachings of Chairman Mao are the truth, the imperialists, revisionists, and their lackeys cannot harm me in the slightest. One day they will be destroyed!" In Brazil, the bloody rule of the reactionaries cannot stop the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. There, revolutionary masses and progressive intellectuals often secretly study Mao Zedong Thought, listen to the broadcasts of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and conduct excellent propaganda activities. A member of a Mao Zedong Thought study group in Rio de Janeiro recently told the Central People's Broadcasting Station that they often propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the masses and print large quantities of the brilliant works of Chairman Mao, the "Three Articles."

Thousands of letters bring good news: The great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines upon the globe. The revolutionary people of the world are determined, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to hold high the banner of this great era, follow the direction pointed out by the helmsman of the era—Chairman Mao—and advance bravely!

    热烈欢呼世界进入毛泽东思想的新时代
    去年一年中，有一百二十多个国家和地区的革命人民，给中央人民广播电台写了数以万计的来信。他们用最真挚的语言，同声称颂毛主席是“当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”，是“世界革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手”，是“世界革命人民心中光芒四射的红太阳”。他们热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    毛主席是我们时代的伟大领袖和舵手
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在来信中，对我们时代的伟大舵手毛主席，表达了最深厚的无产阶级感情和最崇高的敬意。有的信中说：“我们阿尔巴尼亚人民永远热爱毛主席，我们最亲密的战友，世界人民敬爱的伟大领袖。”一位芬兰朋友在来信中说：“毛泽东不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。”澳大利亚听众辛格在来信中写道：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，红太阳温暖了我们的心，照亮了我们前进的道路。”几内亚听众让·马克亲切地写了一首歌颂毛主席的诗。在诗的前十一行，每行开头的第一个法文字母，刚好组成“毛泽东”三个鲜红的大字：
    我羡慕中国人民，
    啊！伟大的领袖，
    是您把正在受难的世界拯救。
    您是革命人民的舵手，
    您是英明的导师，全世界人民都倾听着您的声音，
    您支持受难者，把沉睡的人们唤醒。
    您是领导他们走向幸福的导师和领袖，
    您把通向解放的道路开辟得更加广阔，
    您把所有的革命战士团结在您的思想的旗帜下，
    您粉碎了革命的敌人的无数险恶阴谋，
    您捍卫了人民的事业，免受内外敌人的破坏。
    全世界人民的灯塔，毛泽东主席万岁！
    光明前途的保卫者，毛泽东主席万岁！
    许多听众在来信中表示非常希望到中国访问，希望亲眼见到毛主席。他们说：“能看到当代最伟大的领袖毛主席，能同毛主席握手，将是一生最大的幸福。”许许多多来自世界各地的信件，恳切地索要毛主席像章和毛主席照片。一位尼日利亚朋友说，他喜获毛主席像章后，“坐着看，站着看，并且把像章高高举在头上，表达我对毛主席的无限尊敬。”非洲地区不少听众专门搜集毛主席照片和中国无产阶级文化大革命的照片，并且把照片珍藏起来。访问过中国的一位奥地利听众在一首歌颂毛主席的诗中这样写道：
    崇高啊，他的思想；
    伟大啊，他的业绩；
    他的钢铁般的意志啊，永往直前。
    他，胸怀一轮红日，
    正在引导世界人民，实现崇高的理想。
    为伟大领袖毛主席而战斗和献身
    世界革命人民无限钦佩和热烈赞扬人类的大救星毛主席高举世界革命大旗，领导被压迫人民和被压迫民族向帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派展开了针锋相对的斗争。英国一位听众在信中说：领导着中国人民进行反对资产阶级和修正主义的、具有伟大历史意义的阶级斗争的，是世界上最杰出的人民领袖毛泽东，他同时正在指引着全世界人民进行着反对帝国主义和修正主义的斗争。署名“一个革命者”的一位阿尔及利亚听众说：毛主席是当代最伟大的共产主义旗手，他揭穿了假共产主义者，特别是苏联、南斯拉夫等修正主义集团的真面目。“世界革命人民都热爱毛主席，毛主席是我们五洲四海的红太阳。”一位摩洛哥朋友在来信中的这句话，表达了世界革命人民共同的心声。
    各国革命人民在来信中热烈欢呼世界已经进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。他们在来信中充分反映了：在世界各地，广大革命人民学习毛主席著作，已经成为势不可挡的潮流，越来越多的革命人民渴望学习毛泽东思想，努力钻研毛泽东思想，积极宣传毛泽东思想，认真运用毛泽东思想。澳大利亚听众阿斯宾努指出：“伟大的毛泽东思想红旗是伟大的革命旗帜，我们必须高高举起，让她飘扬全世界。”
    中央人民广播电台日夜传播着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，特别是在开办了“毛主席语录”节目和“毛主席著作选播”节目以后，受到了国外广大听众的最热烈欢迎。他们把北京传出的红色电波看作是他们最好的毛泽东思想大学校。长期收听中央人民广播电台广播的一位西德听众，寄来一篇题为《我们的领袖和救星毛泽东》的歌颂毛泽东思想的颂辞，热情地写道：“啊，伟大的领袖毛泽东，您的思想，把世界从苦难中拯救。我们站在您一边，向您表示忠诚，为您战斗和献身。您的思想的阳光照亮被压迫人民的心坎，您的思想引导他们走向解放。……您，全世界的胜利者和领袖，伟大的毛泽东！”
    毛泽东思想的光芒永远照耀全世界
    各国革命者纷纷来信索要红色宝书《毛主席语录》。他们把毛主席的教导称作是“无价之宝”，是“红色宝剑”。一位芬兰中学生告诉中央人民广播电台：“我的一个同班同学得到一本红宝书，但是我们班上有三十多个同学，全校有一千多名学生，很多人都想学习毛泽东思想。因此我请求你们送给我一些那本著名的红宝书。”美国一位十四岁的盲人用盲文写来要《毛主席语录》的信。苏联一位二十岁的女青年冒着白色恐怖的危险给中央人民广播电台来信说：“请你们寄给我俄文版的《毛主席语录》。”各国广大听众喜得毛主席著作后，如饥似渴地进行学习。无法得到红宝书的听众，一面收听中央人民广播电台广播的毛主席语录，一面记录，长期抄收，积累成册，随时学习，随时运用。许多听众在学习了红宝书后，还向中央人民广播电台写来了真切动人的体会。越南人民军一位同志在来信中说：越南人民由于得到了中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民给予的精神上和物质上的援助，尤其是学习了毛泽东思想，在战斗中更加英勇顽强。越南的一位乡干部来信说：在前进的道路上，每当遇到艰难险阻的时候，我便想起中国人民和全世界人民的伟大导师、敬爱的领袖毛主席的教导。他的教导如茫茫大海中的光芒四射的灯塔。无论是在狂风暴雨的时候，还是在天空云雾密布的时候，这灯塔的光芒始终照射四方。一位刚果（布）朋友指出：今天我们正处在战无不胜的毛泽东思想时代，世界上任何力量都不能使我们屈服。在光辉的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，革命的非洲坚决要同帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其走狗战斗到底。
    学习毛主席著作的潮流势不可挡
    据各国听众来信介绍，世界上许多地区的革命者成立了毛主席著作学习小组、革命小组或其他进步组织。他们根据毛主席的教导，积极从事宣传活动和革命斗争。西德一个进步组织的成员在信中说：“我们是一群西德青年工人、大中学生，我们努力通过加强学习马克思列宁主义和中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的发展了马克思列宁主义的著作，决心为加速美帝国主义及其仆从的灭亡而作出应有的贡献。”这个组织决定把所学到的理论运用到实践中去，使广大的工农群众和进步知识分子掌握毛泽东思想。西德一个城区的一个革命小组确定的主要任务是：“传播和散发中国人民的伟大舵手和领袖毛泽东同志的著作，悬挂当代最高统帅和最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的语录牌。”西德另一个革命小组负责人说：“我们进行的最重要的工作是学习毛泽东同志的著作。”在非洲也有不少学习毛主席著作的组织。尼日利亚的一个毛泽东思想图书馆，为了适应广大读者要求而把这个图书馆进一步充实起来，曾来信给中央人民广播电台，恳切要求给予帮助。有些国家和地区还建立了收听北京广播俱乐部，它们的首要任务也都是学习和宣传毛泽东思想。
    走一辈子毛主席指出的革命道路
    在许多国家，传抄、背诵和印发毛主席语录已蔚然成风。越来越多的革命人民遵照毛主席“组织群众、宣传群众”的教导，经常向周围群众宣传毛泽东思想，散发毛主席著作。越南广平省一位机关工作人员经常深入前线的战壕，向严密监视来犯的敌人和猎打美国空中强盗的自卫队员们朗读《毛主席语录》。他来信说：“什么是我们在日日夜夜地冒着枪林弹雨抗击敌人的战斗中最宝贵的东西呢？是我们的无价之宝《毛主席语录》。现在，在我写信的时候，守卫在战壕里的自卫队员们还在全神贯注地学习着《毛主席语录》。他们一手传一手，人人抄录和背诵，因为他们都把这宝书看作每天必不可少的精神食粮。”英国的一位中学生在来信中告诉中央人民广播电台这样一个故事：“成百的普通工人对毛主席著作产生了浓厚的兴趣。在假期，我在一家毛毯厂工作。当那里的工人们知道我有一本《毛主席语录》的时候，很多人问我能不能借给他们。尽管我非常不愿离开这本书——我最宝贵的财富，但是我还是借给了他们。很多工人便轮流抄录毛主席语录。他们每人都想抄一份，以便经常学习。”外国广大进步听众都这样说：“读毛主席的书，就象听到毛主席的声音。”“毛主席的书，我们要读一辈子；毛主席的话，我们要听一辈子；毛主席指出的革命道路，我们要走一辈子。”
    高举伟大时代的旗帜奋勇前进
    在反动统治下的国家里，革命者和进步听众为了读毛主席的书，要受到种种限制，甚至遭到迫害，但是他们毫不畏惧，坚持追求真理。一个东南亚国家的朋友说：“无论冒多大风险，那怕被控告甚至坐牢，我们还是要坚持学下去，现在如此，将来还是如此。”另一个东南亚国家的一位职员，因学习和宣传毛泽东思想而被解雇，但是他坚信毛主席教导是真理，因此他无所畏惧地向迫害他的反动家伙进行了针锋相对的斗争。他来信说：最近这些反动家伙又想陷害他，他可能被捕入狱，但是，“我心里有了毛主席，我什么都不怕，毛泽东主席的教导是真理，帝修反及其走狗损害不了我的一根毫毛，总有一天他们会被消灭的！”在巴西，反动派的血腥统治，也挡不住毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉的照耀。那里革命群众和进步知识分子经常秘密地学习毛泽东思想，收听中央人民广播电台广播，并且进行非常出色的宣传活动。里约热内卢一个毛主席著作学习小组成员不久前告诉中央人民广播电台说，他们经常在群众中宣传毛泽东思想，大量印刷毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”。
    千信万信传来了一个喜讯：毛泽东思想的伟大光辉普照着全球。世界革命人民决心在毛泽东思想的指引下，高举这伟大时代的旗帜，沿着时代的舵手——毛主席所指出的方向，奋勇前进！
