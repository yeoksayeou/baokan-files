Recently, our area has seen a lot of welcome rain, and the wheat seedlings have turned green. The fields are a sea of green. However, some production teams have fallen behind in their fertilizer work. The river mud they dredged last year still hasn't been brought up; the ash fertilizer hasn't been processed; and the broken fertilizer-carrying tools haven't been repaired. If these tasks are not urgently addressed, they will inevitably affect the growth of the winter wheat.

To achieve a double victory in the 1968 revolution and production, rural leadership teams at all levels must immediately take action to focus on and complete tasks such as accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, and repairing fertilizer-carrying tools. This will ensure that the winter wheat has the necessary fertilizer for regrowth, tillering, and jointing.

    肥料工作要跟上去
    最近，我们这里普降喜雨，麦苗返青，田野里一片油绿。可是有的生产队，肥料工作跟不上，去年罱的河泥，到现在还没有挑上来；灰肥也没有加工；使坏了的运肥工具还没有动手修理。这些工作如不抓紧，势必影响三麦的生长。
    为了夺取一九六八年革命生产双胜利，农村各级生产领导班子要立即动手抓紧抓好积肥、运肥、整修运肥工具等工作，保证三麦返青、分蘖、拔节所需的肥料。
