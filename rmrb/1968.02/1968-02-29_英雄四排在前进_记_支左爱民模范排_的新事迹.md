The entire nation, with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, is advancing bravely under the guidance of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, Sixth Company, 601 Division of the People's Liberation Army, who were awarded the honorable title of "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, are filled with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao. In the face of honor, they remain humble and unassuming, placing themselves on a new starting line of the revolution. They follow Chairman Mao's latest battle commands without pause, advancing in great strides! With the most ardent revolutionary spirit, they always march at the forefront of the vast cultural revolution army!

All glory belongs to the great leader Chairman Mao!

As the saying goes, "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

Vice Chairman Lin said, "All our achievements and victories are won under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and are victories of Mao Zedong Thought."

The soldiers of the Heroic Fourth Platoon never forget this great truth for a moment.

After Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the conferment of the honorable title of "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" upon the Fourth Platoon, the soldiers immediately discussed the following questions:

To whom does this honor belong?

How should we treat this honor?

On the very evening the naming ceremony ended, the soldiers gathered in their dormitory; their excited hearts could not calm down. Each of them opened their carefully made new photo albums, gazing for a long time at the portrait of Chairman Mao, their hearts surging with emotion. They wrote two lines on that day's diary with great reverence:

"All glory belongs to the great leader Chairman Mao!"

"All glory belongs to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

From then on, they placed every banner and every gift sent from all over the country in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao, offering them to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The old soldiers did this, and the new soldiers who came to the Fourth Platoon also did the same.

Li Wenhong, the younger brother of martyr Li Wentong, Li Congwei, the elder brother of Li Congquan, and Chen Tianqing, the younger brother of Chen Tianqing, were about to part with their parents who had come from afar to attend the naming ceremony. What should they say to their elderly parents? They only instructed their parents with one thing: "Others call you the parents of heroes, but do not forget, without Chairman Mao, there would be no honor today. All the glory belongs to our Chairman Mao!" They told their parents that the hearts of the martyrs were dyed red with Mao Zedong Thought, and they should take the revolutionary treasures—Chairman Mao's works—back home and distribute them to the poor and lower-middle peasants, so that Mao Zedong Thought could dye the hearts of more people red, and let the class brothers love Chairman Mao even more. The elderly parents, moved, held their children's hands and said, "Rest assured! We old poor peasants will never forget Chairman Mao in our lifetime, we will always be loyal to Chairman Mao, and we will defend Chairman Mao to the death."

Glory to Chairman Mao, eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao. Every soldier in the Heroic Fourth Platoon treats honor with such boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. They regard honor as a powerful driving force to urge themselves to continue advancing. In the face of honor, there is not a trace of "I" or "self"; there is no arrogance or self-satisfaction. They believe: if they attribute even a little honor to themselves, they will be far from Chairman Mao; if they attribute even a bit of honor to themselves, they will not be able to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions closely. Everyone says: Chairman Mao is our supreme commander, always at the forefront of the revolutionary masses' movement, issuing new battle commands, leading hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses forward. The movement is developing every moment, and we cannot pause for a moment. We must take loyalty to Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao as the starting point and the endpoint of our lives, always following Chairman Mao and advancing in great strides, creating new merits for the people.

The New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily was published. The soldiers of the Heroic Fourth Platoon gathered in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao, studied this editorial, and held a heated discussion. They unanimously agreed that this is a new call to arms issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, proposing new, more glorious, and more arduous tasks for supporting the left. All the soldiers are full of confidence and, in front of the memorials of martyrs Li Wentong, Li Congquan, and Chen Tianqing, solemnly swore: Determined to inherit the heroic will, to turn the will into a grand blueprint. In the new year, follow Chairman Mao without leaving a step. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will fight there, with the fearless spirit of "defending Chairman Mao, even if we die, we are willing," and fight bravely to implement and fully implement each battle command and each latest instruction from Chairman Mao.

To implement in action, first implement in thought. They first demanded more from themselves in thought, using higher standards to strictly require themselves.

When the company evaluated the "Four Good" based on Chairman Mao's latest instructions, others said, "Every soldier in the Fourth Platoon is a hero, each one is like Li Wentong, and all should be Five Good soldiers." The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon compared themselves to Li Wentong to find their shortcomings, saying, compared to Li Wentong's following Chairman Mao without leaving a step, we are still far, far behind.

They acted swiftly to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad masses, and the masses all praised the Fourth Platoon as a model for studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon compared themselves to the revolutionary masses to find their shortcomings, saying, compared to the revolutionary masses following Chairman Mao, we are still far, far behind.

Many comrades came to the Fourth Platoon to exchange experiences on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, all saying they learned from the Fourth Platoon. The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon always humbly said, "We still don't do enough." They believed that in executing the tasks given by Chairman Mao, if there is even a little thought of "enough" in their minds, their steps will be far from Chairman Mao; only by always seeing that they are still far, far behind can they follow Chairman Mao closely.

The comrades of the Heroic Fourth Platoon are like this, always demanding more from themselves, strictly requiring themselves, constantly finding their shortcomings, constantly revolutionizing, and constantly advancing!

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, always learn from the masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must all have thorough revolutionary spirit, and we must not for a moment be separated from the masses. As long as we do not separate from the masses, we will surely be victorious."

The soldiers of the Heroic Fourth Platoon listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, rely on the masses, learn from the masses, and have achieved one victory after another in their work of supporting the left in the past year. In the face of honor, in the new year, they firmly believe: as long as they closely rely on the masses and more humbly learn from the masses, they will surely achieve greater victories.

After the Fourth Platoon was awarded the honorable title of "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People," people from all over the country proposed to learn from the Heroic Fourth Platoon. The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon replied: "No, the masses are the true heroes."

The soldiers of the Heroic Fourth Platoon are all willing to be the little students of the masses. People from all over the country who came to the Fourth Platoon to learn were often unending. The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon all regarded this as the best opportunity to learn from the masses. They always first asked the revolutionary masses from various places to introduce their good experiences in studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. When the soldiers of the platoon went out to introduce the heroic deeds of the three martyrs Li Wentong and others, they always reminded the dispatched comrades repeatedly: your task is, first, to honestly learn from the masses and not forget to bring back the experiences from other places; second, through the propaganda of the martyrs' deeds, to widely spread the great Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers who went out all carried a thick notebook, and when they returned, it was filled with precious experiences learned from the masses. Platoon leader Pang Chaosheng, deputy platoon leader Ma Shouzheng, and Li Fuguang, Wang Fufeng, Yu Shiweng, and Yu Dexiang, when introducing Li Wentong's deeds outside, except for one person going on stage to speak, the other comrades all sat with the masses. They said, sitting on the stage always felt uncomfortable; only by sitting with the masses on the same bench did they feel at ease. The representatives of the Heroic Fourth Platoon going on stage, which seemed natural to others, were thought of very deeply by the comrades of the Fourth Platoon. They often encouraged each other: do not forget that we are the servants of the people, we must always, always be among the masses. This is not just a matter of style, but a major issue of preventing class sentiment from degenerating, and it must be paid attention to!

As the glorious deeds of the Heroic Fourth Platoon spread, tens of millions of military and civilian personnel from the south of the Yangtze River and inside the Great Wall sent batches and batches of letters to the Fourth Platoon to learn from them. Each letter praised the Fourth Platoon highly, with enthusiastic words. How did the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon think? They regarded each letter as the best textbook, as the earnest expectations of the people of the whole country, and as new, higher requirements put forward for them. They read and studied each letter carefully. One day, six soldiers, tears in their eyes, discussed a letter. They read it over and over again, writing down every word and sentence in their notebooks, thinking deeply and discussing. This letter was written by a group of "Little Red Guards" from afar, saying in the letter: "Be like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wentong, from a young age have a red heart loyal to Chairman Mao, from a young age do as Chairman Mao waves his hand and advance!" The sincere feelings of the Little Red Guards' boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao deeply moved the soldiers. They said, we must follow Chairman Mao step by step. Otherwise, how can we not feel ashamed in front of the Little Red Guards? They were like this, sincerely and humbly willing to be the little students of the masses, the little students of the Little Red Guards.

The higher the prestige of the Fourth Platoon among the masses, the more the masses trusted the Fourth Platoon, the more the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon humbly asked the masses for advice. In the busy days of constantly receiving visits from people from other places, the comrades of the Fourth Platoon always thought of the workshops where they performed their supporting tasks, thought of the revolutionary masses of workers. Although they were busy during the day, they also went to the workshops at night, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the masses of workers, making revolution together. They formulated a new plan of "learning from ten revolutionary factions," with everyone deeply entering the masses, learning from the workers, and asking the workers for advice. From this, they more deeply felt that only by always fighting together with the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought could they truly follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and correctly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepened, in the new year, many soldiers did not know how to raise the work of supporting the left to a higher level. After the factory achieved revolutionary great unity, due to the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism not being thoroughly eliminated from the masses' minds, the revolutionary great unity in some workshops was still not solid. What should be done? The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon went deep into the workshops, listening to the opinions of the masses of workers. An old worker said very frankly: bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Factionalism is not overthrown, Chairman Mao's latest instructions cannot be implemented! Hearing the old worker's words, the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon were greatly inspired and immediately helped the revolutionary factions to annihilate factionalism and consolidate revolutionary great unity.

This incident made the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon more deeply realize that in the new situation, only by more closely relying on the masses, entering the masses, could they constantly discover new problems, solve new problems, summarize new experiences, and raise the work of supporting the left to a new level.

At present, the Fourth Platoon is advancing on the road to victory under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. But as they said, the process of advancing is the process of learning from the masses. They often use Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage themselves: "The situation is constantly changing, to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must learn."

The struggle to eliminate selfishness is endless, always advancing

"Don't mind me, save the Red Guards!" This is the last sentence left by comrade Li Wentong in his final moments, which most vividly and deeply reflects Li Wentong's extremely sublime world of proletarian greatness, and also represents the spiritual world of all the soldiers in the Fourth Platoon.

However, the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon demand of themselves like this. They say:

What was done in the past does not mean it will be done in the future.

The struggle to eliminate selfishness is endless, and merit is achieved in a lifetime.

They regard the lofty spiritual realm they have already reached as only the starting point of their thought revolutionization. They always demand more from themselves with higher standards. They often remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our work achievements are obviously and undoubtedly great. But at the same time, our work still has shortcomings. Whoever only sees the achievements and does not see the shortcomings will not be able to fight well for the realization of the Party's tasks."

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the comrades of the Fourth Platoon believed: if they did not demand more from themselves to continue advancing, they would fall behind the times and fall behind the steps of the masses. Therefore, they took "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, according to the requirement of "eliminating selfishness at the crucial point and establishing greatness at the root," and conducted a more in-depth summary of the struggle to eliminate selfishness and establish greatness. They said, "selfishness" has "three natures": long-term, stubborn, and latent. "Selfishness" also has "three lines": the first line of selfishness is known to all, the second line of selfishness is unknown to others but easily exposed, and the third line of selfishness is very hidden. The "three natures" of "selfishness" are hidden in the third line, hidden in the third line. To thoroughly expose "selfishness," fight it fiercely, and change it resolutely, one must dig to the root of the "three lines," straight to its lair. Only in this way can one, at any time, do as Li Wentong did, "don't mind me," and be "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people, and be loyal to Chairman Mao forever and ever.

After the New Year's Day editorial was published, they followed Chairman Mao's new battle commands and immediately launched an open rectification, using the method of "mass evaluation of supporting the left meetings" to further widely and deeply solicit the opinions of the revolutionary masses on the work of the Fourth Platoon supporting the left. They, together with the revolutionary masses, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to examine their work bit by bit, to evaluate it bit by bit, to actively expose selfishness, and to dig out the third line of "selfishness" with higher standards! In this way, the prestige of the Fourth Platoon among the masses was further enhanced. The revolutionary masses said: the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon are truly red hearts toward the red sun, wholeheartedly for the left.

Soldiers urge cadres, and cadres lead soldiers. The new platoon leader Pang Chaosheng and deputy platoon leader Ma Shouzheng of the Fourth Platoon always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "being good at being a 'platoon leader'" and require the soldiers to supervise themselves strictly at all times and in all places. They are very clear: to raise the thought revolutionization of the entire platoon to a new level, the thought revolutionization of the cadres must first be raised to a new level. They regard comrade Li Wentong as the most outstanding representative of the entire platoon and propose in the entire platoon to take Li Wentong as an example, to examine each cadre, to require each cadre. "What Li Wentong has done, have you done?" has become the common language of all the soldiers in the platoon to require each cadre and for cadres to help each soldier. In this way, from below to above, it further promotes the cadres to establish a high degree of self-awareness in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism; from above to below, the soldiers also see the example from the cadres and learn the way of thought revolutionization. In this way, from below to above, it is constantly bringing the thought revolutionization of the Fourth Platoon to a new level. Not only are the old soldiers more steadfast in their thoughts, but the new soldiers, once they enter this great furnace of Mao Zedong Thought, also quickly temper a red heart.

The Fourth Platoon is like this, advancing, advancing, forever advancing on the great road of thought revolutionization under the guidance of Chairman Mao!

    英雄四排在前进
    ——记“支左爱民模范排”的新事迹
    举国上下，亿万革命群众正沿着伟大领袖毛主席最新指示指引的航向，奋勇前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    荣获毛主席和林副主席亲自批准授予“支左爱民模范排”光荣称号的人民解放军六○一一部队某部六连四排的全体战士们，满怀对毛主席的赤胆忠心，在荣誉面前，不骄不躁，把自己放在新的革命起跑线上，紧跟毛主席的最新战斗号令，一刻不停地大踏步前进！他们以最饱满的革命热情，始终走在浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军的前列！
    一切光荣归于伟大领袖毛主席
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    林副主席说：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”
    英雄四排的战士一时一刻没有忘记这个伟大的真理。
    毛主席和林副主席亲自批准授予四排以“支左爱民模范排”的崇高荣誉后，四排战士立即讨论这样一个问题：
    荣誉属于谁？
    怎样对待这个荣誉？
    就在命名大会结束的当天晚上，战士们围聚在宿舍里，一颗颗激动的心，怎么也不能平静；一个个打开自己精心制作的新影集，久久地凝望着毛主席像，心潮汹涌，波涛滚滚。他们在当天的日记上，恭恭敬敬地写下了两行大字：
    “一切光荣归于伟大领袖毛主席！”
    “一切光荣归于战无不胜的毛泽东思想！”
    从此，他们把从全国各地寄来的每一面锦旗，每一件礼物，都放在毛主席像前，献给伟大领袖毛主席。
    老战士这样，新到四排的战士也是这样。
    烈士李文忠的弟弟李文红，李从全的哥哥李从卫，陈佃奎的弟弟陈佃兵，要和远道赶来参加命名大会的父母分别了。临别该向老人家说些什么呢？他们嘱咐老人的只有一件事：“人家称你们是英雄的爸爸、英雄的妈妈，可不要忘了，要不是毛主席，哪有今天的光荣。一切光荣都是咱们毛主席的！”他们告诉老人，烈士们的心是用毛泽东思想染红的，要把大家赠给的革命宝书——毛主席著作带回去，分赠给贫下中农，让毛泽东思想染红更多人的心，让阶级兄弟们都更加热爱毛主席。老人们感动地拉着孩子的手说：“放心吧！爹妈一辈的老贫农，一辈子也忘不了毛主席，永远忠于毛主席，誓死保卫毛主席。”
    光荣归于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席。英雄四排每一个战士就是怀着这样无限忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心对待荣誉的。他们把荣誉看作是激励自己、鞭策自己继续前进的强大动力。在荣誉面前，没有半点“我”字，没有半点“私”字；没有一点骄傲，没有一点自满。他们认为：把荣誉往自己头上记一点，就会离毛主席万丈远；把荣誉往自己头上记一分，就对毛主席最新指示不能紧跟。大家说：毛主席是我们的最高统帅，总是站在革命群众运动的最前头，不断发出新的战斗号令，领导亿万革命群众前进。运动在每时每刻不断向前发展，我们不能有丝毫停顿。要把忠于毛主席、紧跟毛主席作为自己一生的起点，一生的终点，始终紧跟毛主席大踏步前进，为人民立新功。
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论发表了。英雄四排的战士们围在毛主席像前，学习了这篇社论，展开了热烈的讨论。一致认为，这是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出的夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新的动员令，对支左工作提出了新的更光荣更艰巨的任务。全体战士充满信心，在烈士李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎的纪念碑前庄严宣誓：决心继承英雄志，誓将遗愿化宏图。在新的一年里紧跟毛主席寸步不离。毛主席指到那里就打到那里，以“保卫毛主席，死了也甘心”的大无畏精神，为条条落实、全面落实毛主席的每项战斗号令，每一个最新指示而英勇战斗。
    要在行动上落实，先要在思想上落实。他们首先从思想上，用更高的标准，严格要求自己。
    连队以毛主席最新指示为纲进行“四好”总评的时候，别人说：“四排战士人人是英雄，个个都象李文忠，都应该是五好战士。”四排战士对照李文忠找差距，他们说，比起李文忠紧跟毛主席寸步不离，我们差得很远很远。
    他们闻风而动，向广大群众宣传毛主席最新指示的时候，群众都称赞四排是学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范。四排战士对照无产阶级革命派找差距，他们说，比起革命群众紧跟毛主席，我们还差得很远很远。
    很多同志到四排来交流落实毛主席最新指示经验的时候，都说向四排学习。四排战士总是谦虚地说，我们做得“还不够”。他们认为，在执行毛主席交给的任务时，只要自己的头脑里有一点“够”的想法，脚步就会离毛主席很远很远；只有时刻看到还差得很远很远，才能跟毛主席很紧很紧。
    英雄四排的同志们，就是这样对自己高标准，严要求，不断找差距，不断革命，不断地前进着！
    遵照毛主席教导，永远向群众学习
    毛主席教导我们：“我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”
    英雄四排全体战士听毛主席的话，遵照毛主席的教导，依靠群众，向群众学习，在过去一年里的支左工作中，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在荣誉面前，在新的一年里，他们坚信：只要紧紧依靠群众，更虚心地向群众学习，就一定能取得更大的胜利。
    四排获得“支左爱民模范排”的光荣称号以后，全国各地都提出向英雄四排学习。四排战士的回答是：不，“群众是真正的英雄”。
    英雄四排的战士个个甘当群众的小学生。从全国各地到四排来学习的人，经常络绎不绝，四排的战士都把这看作是向群众学习的最好的机会，他们总是先请各地革命群众介绍活学活用毛泽东思想，贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的好经验。排里的同志出外介绍李文忠等三烈士的英雄事迹时，大家总是向派出的同志嘱咐再嘱咐：你们的任务，一是老老实实向群众学习，不要忘记把外地经验学回来；二是通过宣传烈士事迹，要大力传播伟大的毛泽东思想。他们出去的一个个战士，都带着一个厚厚的笔记本，回来时，记满了向群众学来的宝贵经验。排长庞朝胜、副排长马守增以及李福全、王福文、于世文、于德祥等，外出介绍李文忠事迹时，除派一人上台讲话，其他同志都是和群众坐在一起。他们说，坐在主席台上，总觉得不是滋味；只有和群众坐在一条板凳上，心里才踏实。英雄四排的代表上主席台，这在别人看起来是理所当然的事，而四排的同志自己却想得很远很远，经常互相勉励着：可不要忘了自己是人民的勤务员啊，一定要永远永远置身于群众之中，这不只是作风问题，是防止阶级感情蜕变的大事情，一定要注意！
    随着英雄四排光辉事迹的传播，亿万军民从大江南北、长城内外寄来大批大批向四排学习的书信。封封来信都写着对四排的高度评价，热情赞语。四排的战士们又是怎么想的？他们把封封来信看成是最好的教科书，看作是全国人民对他们的殷切期望，看作是对他们提出的新的更高要求。他们对每封来信都是认真地读、认真地学。一天，六个战士热泪盈眶地讨论着一封来信。大家念了一遍又一遍，一字一句地记在笔记本上，沉思着，议论着。这封信是一群署名“红小兵”的小同学写来的，信上说：“要象英雄四排和李文忠那样，从小就长一颗忠于毛主席的红心，从小就做到毛主席挥手我前进！”红小兵们无限热爱、无限忠于毛主席的真挚感情，深深地感动着战士们。他们说，咱一定要步步紧跟毛主席。不然，咱在红小兵面前能不感到惭愧吗？他们就是这样虚心诚挚地甘当群众的小学生，甘当红小兵的小学生。
    四排在群众中的威信越高，群众越是信任四排，四排的战士们越是虚心地向群众请教。在不断接待外地群众来访的繁忙日子里，四排的同志心里时刻想着自己执行支左任务的工厂车间，想着工人革命群众，尽管白天很忙，晚上也要下车间，和工人群众一起学习毛主席最新指示，一起闹革命。他们制订了“十学革命派”的新计划，人人深入群众，向工人学习，向工人请教。从这当中，他们更深切地体会到，只有永远紧紧地同用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众战斗在一起，才能真正紧跟毛主席的最新指示，深刻领会毛主席的最新指示，正确执行毛主席的最新指示。
    随着文化大革命运动的深入发展，在新的一年里，开始许多战士对如何把支左工作提到一个更高的水平上，心中没有底。工厂实现革命大联合以后，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性还没有从群众的思想中彻底扫除，有的车间的革命大联合还很不巩固。怎么办？四排战士深入车间，听取工人群众的意见。一位老工人非常干脆地说：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。派性不倒，毛主席的最新指示就落实不了！听了老工人的话，四排战士受到很大的启发，立即帮助无产阶级革命派围歼派性，巩固革命大联合。
    这件事使四排的战士们更深刻地认识到，在新形势下，只有更紧密地依靠群众，深入群众，才能不断地发现新问题，解决新问题，总结新经验，把支左工作做出新水平。
    当前，四排正在按照毛主席最新指示指引的方向，在胜利的道路上前进着。但正如他们所说的，前进的过程，就是向群众学习的过程。他们经常用毛主席的教导勉励自己：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”
    破私无止境，永远向前进
    “不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”这是李文忠同志在生命的最后一刻留下的一句话，它最集中、最生动、最深刻地反映了李文忠无比崇高的无产阶级大公的精神世界，也代表了四排全体战士的精神世界。
    然而，四排战士却是这样要求自己的。他们说：
    过去曾做到的，不等于今后做到了。
    破私无止境，立功在一生。
    他们把自己已经达到的崇高的精神境界，只看作是自己思想革命化的一个起点。他们总是以更高的标准，严格地要求自己。他们经常牢记毛主席的教导：“我们的工作成绩是很显然的，毫无疑义的。但是同时，我们的工作中依然存在着缺点。谁要是只看见成绩一面，不看见缺点一面，谁也就不会很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，四排的同志们认为：如果不以更高的标准要求自己继续前进，就会落后于时代，落后于群众的步伐。因此，他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，按照“破私破在要害处，立公立在根本上”的要求，对破私立公的斗争进行了更加深入的总结。他们说，“私”字有“三性”：长期性，顽固性，潜伏性。“私”字又分“三线”：第一线的私是众所周知的私，第二线的私是别人不知又容易往外亮的私，第三线的私是很隐蔽的私。“私”字的“三性”就耽在第三线上，隐蔽在第三线上。对“私”字要彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改，就必须挖根挖到“三线”上，直捣它的老窝。只有这样，才能在任何时候，做到“不要管我”，才能“完全”“彻底”为人民，才能一颗红心永远永远忠于毛主席。
    元旦社论发表以后，他们紧跟毛主席新的战斗号令，立即开展了开门整风，运用“群众讲评支左会”的方式，进一步广泛深入地征求革命群众对四排支左工作的意见。他们与革命群众一道，以毛泽东思想为武器，对自己的工作一点一滴地进行检查，一点一滴地进行讲评，主动亮私，用更高的标准狠挖“私”字的第三线！这样，四排在群众中的威信更加提高了。革命群众说：四排战士真是颗颗红心向红太阳，全心全意为左派。
    战士促干部，干部带战士。四排新任排长庞朝胜、副排长马守增都牢记毛主席“要善于当‘班长’”的教导，要求战士时时、处处从严监督自己。他们十分明确：全排的思想革命化要提到一个新水平，首先要干部的思想革命化提到一个新水平。他们把李文忠同志作为全排最杰出的代表，在全排提出要以李文忠为榜样，对照每个干部，检查每个干部，要求每个干部。“李文忠做到的，你做到了吗？”已经成了全排战士要求每个干部、干部帮助每个战士的共同语言。就这样下促上，进一步促使干部树立起斗私批修的高度自觉性；上带下，战士也从干部身上看到了样子，学到了思想革命化的路子。这样下促上带，正不断地把四排思想革命化带到新水平上。不仅老战士思想更过得硬，新战士一投入这个毛泽东思想的大熔炉，也很快就把一颗心炼红。
    四排就是这样，朝着毛主席指引的方向，在思想革命化的大道上，前进！前进！永远前进！
