Dominican students staged a protest against the dictatorship in defiance of the pro-American dictatorship's ban on public demonstrations and marches. Students at the University of Santo Domingo in the capital bravely held a demonstration late on the 13th against the dictatorship and demanded increased funding for the university.

The protesting students gathered in the streets of the city center, lighting bonfires. They also destroyed two cars belonging to government officials. The reactionary forces in the Dominican Republic, who persist in opposing the people, were terrified by the students' revolutionary actions. Panicked, they dispatched fully armed military police to disperse the student gathering. The students immediately retaliated by throwing stones at the military police who came to suppress them.

    多米尼加学生举行反对独裁统治示威
    多米尼加首都圣多明各大学的学生不顾亲美独裁政府禁止群众示威游行的反动法令，毅然在十三日深夜举行反对独裁统治和要求增加大学经费的示威游行。
    示威学生聚集在圣多明各市中心的街道上，燃起一堆一堆的篝火。他们还捣毁了停在街上的反动政府官员的两辆汽车。坚持与人民为敌的多米尼加反动派被示威学生这一革命行动吓坏了。慌忙出动全副武装的军警冲击学生的集会。学生们立即用石块回击前来镇压他们的军警。
