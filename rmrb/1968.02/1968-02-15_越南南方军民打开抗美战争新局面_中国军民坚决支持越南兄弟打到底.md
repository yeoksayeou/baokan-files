Vietnamese South Military and Civilians Open Up New Phase in Anti-American War

Chinese Military and Civilians Resolutely Support Vietnamese Comrades to the End

New China News Agency, February 14th

On the 14th, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao sent a telegram to Chen Nan Zhong, Chairman of the Military Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, warmly congratulating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Military Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam,

Chen Nan Zhong Comrade:

On the glorious seventh anniversary of the founding of the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extend our warmest congratulations to the heroic people and armed forces of South Vietnam.

We warmly congratulate the glorious anniversary of the military and civilians of South Vietnam! We warmly congratulate the recent Tet Offensive victories of the military and civilians of South Vietnam!

The armed forces of the people of South Vietnam are the children of the Vietnamese people, an invincible and heroic people's armed force. Over the past seven years, under the strong leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the military and civilians of South Vietnam have creatively applied the strategies and tactics of people's war, waging a relentless struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, annihilating a large number of enemy troops, liberating vast territories, and creating a favorable revolutionary situation.

Recently, the military and civilians of South Vietnam, with the momentum of a surging tide and the force of thunder, launched a powerful and fierce Tet Offensive against the enemy, achieving stunning victories that shocked the world. This great victory has dealt a severe blow to American imperialism and its lackeys, opening up a new phase in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, and pushing the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle to a new high.

The days of the American invaders in Vietnam are numbered, but they will certainly make more desperate struggles. The enemy's desperation will only strengthen the Vietnamese people's resolve to fight to the end. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "No difficulties can stop the revolutionary people from advancing. Persistence will lead to victory." We are confident that the heroic Vietnamese people, with their rich experience in struggle, will definitely respond to the call of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, to fight to the end and overcome any difficulties on the road ahead, wage a protracted war, and achieve final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression.

After being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the 700 million Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are determined to be the strong rear guard of our Vietnamese comrades. We resolutely support you to fight to the end until you achieve a complete victory in the war of resistance against American aggression!

Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, Lin Biao

    新华社十四日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪同志，十四日打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会军事委员会陈南忠主任，热烈祝贺越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年。电报全文如下：
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会军事委员会
    陈南忠主任：
    在光荣的越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年的时候，我代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，向英雄的越南南方人民和人民解放武装力量全体战友表示最热烈的祝贺。
    我们热烈祝贺越南南方军民的光荣节日！热烈祝贺越南南方军民最近取得的新春大捷！
    越南南方人民解放武装力量是越南人民的子弟兵，是一支英雄的不可战胜的人民武装力量。七年来，越南南方军民在越南南方民族解放阵线的坚强领导下，创造性地运用了人民战争的战略战术，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行了艰苦卓绝的战斗，大量消灭了敌人的有生力量，解放了大片国土，打出了一片大好的革命形势。
    最近，越南南方军民，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，向敌人发动了强大凌厉的新春攻势，取得了震惊世界的辉煌战果。这一伟大胜利给予了美帝国主义及其走狗极其沉痛的打击，打开了越南人民抗美救国战争的新局面，把越南人民的革命斗争推向了一个新高潮。全中国人民和全世界革命人民都为你们无比辉煌的胜利而感到欢欣鼓舞！
    美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了，但是，它必然会进行更加疯狂的垂死挣扎。敌人的疯狂，只能更加激起越南人民斗争到底的坚强决心。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“任何困难都阻挡不住革命人民的前进。坚持下去就是胜利。”我们深信，具有丰富斗争经验的英雄的越南人民，必定能够坚决响应越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席决战决胜的号召，克服前进道路上的任何困难，打一场持久战，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，誓作兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾。我们坚决支持你们打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的彻底胜利！
      中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长　林彪
