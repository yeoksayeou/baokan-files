We must resolutely fight against "selfishness" and "momentary thoughts." We must persevere through hardships on the snow-capped mountains at the Kajila Military Depot.

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously defends "selfishness," opposes the transformation of one's worldview, and falsely claims that "the transformation of one's worldview can only come slowly." This is his poisonous drug meant to sedate revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of one's worldview is a fundamental transformation." We must study Mao Zedong Thought, eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, transform our worldview, and promote the revolutionization of our thinking. This is the requirement of the times for every revolutionary. The comrades at our military depot are able to take root in Kajila because Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in everyone's mind. Over the years, as old soldiers have been demobilized and new soldiers have joined, we have consistently used Mao Zedong Thought to build the depot. We have focused on the active study and application of the "Old Three Articles" to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, thereby ensuring that all personnel at the depot continue to advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

Our military depot is located on the Qamdo Plateau of the Gangdise Mountains. The altitude is high, the air is thin, and people easily become dizzy and short of breath. It is cold and snowy all year round, and one cannot take off one's cotton clothes in any season. Surrounding us are snow-capped mountains. One must travel dozens of miles to see a few scattered Tibetan herdsmen and primitive forests. People say: "Kajila, Kajila, snowflakes in June, frozen lumps in December." However, we have firmly taken root in this icy place. We are not blown down by strong winds or crushed by heavy snow. We consider the depot our home, take pride in staying on the plateau, and find joy in hard work. We have overcome numerous difficulties. When there were no houses, we built them ourselves. When there were no vegetables, we grew them ourselves. When there was no firewood, we went out into the ice and snow to gather it. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of hardships and trample difficulties underfoot. The altitude of 4,800 meters is nothing to soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

We are able to take root on the plateau and persevere through hardships because of the great victory of eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness through Mao Zedong Thought. We deeply feel that "selfishness" is the great enemy of building the depot. If "selfishness" is not overcome, the depot cannot be solidly built. The process of building the depot is the process of fighting selfishness and nurturing public-mindedness. The work of the depot is service-oriented, and we spend the whole day in a few rooms in the wilderness, delivering water and carrying meals. Whenever thoughts of seeking fame and personal gain arise, we use the ideological weapon of "selflessly serving others" to fiercely fight against selfishness and achieve complete and thorough service to the people. When faced with hardships, if thoughts of fearing hardship and fatigue arise, we recall the glorious deeds of the Red Army during the Long March, eating grass roots and tree bark, crossing mountains and rivers, and overcome the fear of hardship. We cultivate our revolutionary will by taking on heavy burdens and finding hard work. When thoughts of fearing death arise, we think of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives, and consciously use the idea that "dying for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai" to fiercely fight against "selfishness" and establish a revolutionary view of life and death.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our self-awareness in fighting selfishness has increased. We have listed the crimes of "selfishness," dug up its roots, and talked about the glory of "public-mindedness." We have turned the depot into a battlefield for fighting selfishness. We have seized upon every momentary thought of "selfishness," actively launched attacks, and fought relentlessly. The ground of "selfishness" in our minds has become smaller and smaller, and public-minded thoughts have become more and more. Each time we fight against "selfishness," we add a bit more to our red heart of wholeheartedly serving the people. We keep the highest directives in our hearts, wholeheartedly serve the people, and have established a noble view of hardship and joy that is willing to endure a lifetime of hard work and find sweetness in the heart even in the face of bitterness and toil. If we were to believe the fallacy spread by the Chinese Khrushchev that the transformation of one's worldview should come "slowly," "selfishness" would wreak havoc in our minds and continually devour "public-mindedness." We will not be deceived. We must fight against "selfishness" every moment, every day, every month, and every year. We must overthrow and stink up the "selfishness" in our minds and persevere through hardships on the Gangdise Mountains.

    狠斗“私”字“一闪念”  艰苦奋斗雪山上
    卡集拉兵站
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力维护“私”字，反对改造世界观，胡说什么：“世界观的改造只能慢慢来”，这是他毒害革命者的麻醉剂。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。学习毛泽东思想，破私立公，改造世界观，搞好思想革命化，这是时代对我们每一个革命者的要求。我们兵站的同志能够在卡集拉扎根，首先是由于毛泽东思想在每个人的头脑里扎了根。几年来，老战士陆续复员，新战士不断增加，我们始终坚持用毛泽东思想建站，抓住活学活用“老三篇”，促进人的思想革命化，从而保证了全站人员沿着毛主席指引的方向不断前进。
    我们兵站在川藏高原的甲皮拉山上，地势较高，空气稀薄，使人容易头昏气喘，常年风雪严寒，四季脱不下棉衣。周围除了雪山还是雪山，翻越几十里以外，才能见到零星的藏族牧民和原始森林。人们这样说：“卡集拉，卡集拉，六月飘雪花，十二月冻成冰疙瘩。”然而，我们却在这冰窝里牢牢地扎下根，狂风刮不倒，大雪压不倒。我们以兵站为家，以常驻高原为荣，以艰苦奋斗为乐。我们克服了重重困难，没有房子自己动手盖，没有蔬菜自己种，没有柴禾到冰天雪地里去打。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，不畏艰苦，把困难踩在脚下；拔海四千八百米这个高度，在毛泽东思想武装起来的战士面前，根本算不了什么。
    我们能扎根在高原，艰苦奋斗，是用毛泽东思想破私立公的伟大胜利。我们深深体会到，“私”字是建设兵站的大敌。“私”字斗不倒，兵站建不牢。建设兵站的过程，就是斗私心树公心的过程。兵站是服务性的工作，整天在荒山僻野几间房里，送水端饭。每当一出现为名为利的私心杂念时，我们就用“毫不利己专门利人”的思想武器去狠斗私心，做到完全彻底为人民服务。面对艰苦的环境，出现怕苦、怕累的私心杂念时，我们就回忆红军长征时吃草根、树皮，跋山涉水的光辉事迹，斗掉怕苦的思想，专挑重担、专找苦活来磨炼革命意志。出现“怕死”的念头时，我们就想革命先烈抛头颅洒热血的英雄形象，自觉地用“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的思想，狠斗“私”字，树立革命的生死观。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们斗私的自觉性更高了，大列“私”字的罪状，大挖“私”字的根源，大谈“公”字的光辉。我们把兵站当成斗私的战场，我们抓住一闪念的“私”字，积极进攻，穷追猛斗。头脑里“私”字的地盘越来越少，为公的思想就越来越多；斗一次“私”字，就增加一分全心全意为人民服务的红心。我们把最高指示记心间，全心全意为人民，树立了端一辈子盆子也甘愿、再苦再累心里也是甜的高尚的苦乐观。如果听信中国赫鲁晓夫散布的世界观改造要“慢慢来”的谬论，“私”字就会在我们头脑里兴风作浪，不断地吃掉“公”字。我们决不上当，一定要时时斗私，天天斗私，月月斗私，年年斗私，把自己头脑里的“私”字斗垮、斗臭，艰苦奋斗在甲皮拉山上。
