The revolutionary workers of the Luoyang Bearing Factory, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have carried forward the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance. They have focused on the revolution and vigorously promoted production, successfully trial-manufacturing China's first large-diameter bearing with a diameter of 4.1 meters and a weight of 8 tons. The entire factory's revolutionary workers enthusiastically acclaim this as a brilliant achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

With the rapid development of China's socialist construction, many important sectors increasingly urgently need large-diameter bearings. The revolutionary workers of this factory, with boundless class love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have set ambitious goals and resolved to overcome the "authorities" and "experts" of the bourgeoisie. They have completed the trial-manufacturing of this set of large-diameter bearings with the fastest speed, the best quality, and the lowest cost.
