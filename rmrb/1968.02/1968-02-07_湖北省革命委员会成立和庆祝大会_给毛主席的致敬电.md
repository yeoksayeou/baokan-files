Most, most revered great leader Chairman Mao:

Today, the Hubei proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionaries, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, report to you, our heart's reddest red sun, a piece of news that inspires the heart: In the storm and stress of class struggle, the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born triumphantly on the banks of the Yangtze River where you once sailed!

This is the great victory of your boundless thought!

This is the great victory of your proletarian revolutionary line!

This is another great feat created by the People's Liberation Army of China, which you personally created and led, in the "three supports, two militaries" work!

This is another triumphant song echoing through the clouds, as 32 million people of Hubei fully implement your latest instructions!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! On this grand day of red flags and cheers, south of the Dabie Mountains, north of Dongting Lake, every red heart turns to the sun, singing "The East is Red" with all their might. We hold high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," facing Beijing, and from the bottom of our hearts, we wish you, dear Chairman, eternal life! Eternal life!

The waves of the Yangtze River surge to the sky, and the nine tributaries have their source. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Remembering the battle course of Wuhan, which time was it not you who personally guided us? Turning the pages of Hubei's revolutionary history, which page was not written with your brilliant thoughts?

Respected Chairman Mao! It was you who, in the days of China's deep suffering, parted the mist in Wuhan and established the "Central Peasant Movement Training Institute," writing the brilliant "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," ruthlessly denouncing Chen Duxiu and his follower, the Chinese Khrushchev, for their rightist capitulationism, and brilliantly proposing the great truth of seizing power with the gun, opening the victorious path of surrounding the cities from the countryside.

Respected Chairman Mao! It was you who, in the footsteps of China's great leap forward, visited Wuhan time and again, leading us to ride the waves. The people of Hubei, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, marching forward along the general line for socialist construction that you have formulated.

Respected Chairman Mao! It was you who personally initiated and led the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, opening a new era in the international communist movement. The red lamp on Tiananmen Square will forever shine with revolutionary light, and the surging Yangtze River will forever surge with revolutionary waves.

Respected Chairman Mao! At the crucial moment when the proletarian cultural revolution was just beginning, you came to the heroic city of Wuhan. Respected Chairman Mao! On this day, amid the cheers of the whistles on the river, you stepped forward vigorously, reviewing the army crossing the river, radiant and full of vigor, sailing the ten-thousand-mile Yangtze River. "No matter how the wind blows and the waves beat, it is like a leisurely stroll in the courtyard." Just as you taught us: "Great winds and waves are not to be feared. Human society has developed through great winds and waves." Most respected Chairman Mao, your simple yet powerful voice inspires us to forge ahead bravely along the course you have blazed, through great winds and waves.

"Every reactionary force that is about to perish will make a final struggle against the revolutionary force." At this critical moment of life and death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the stubborn walkers of the capitalist road, in collusion with the ghosts and snakes in society, launched another mad counterattack. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It was you who, time and again, inspired us to break through the surging waves and storms, seizing the decisive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. How many times have we sworn to you:

"As long as China does not change color, it is worth giving up our youth." We have only one belief: Your brilliant thoughts cannot be abandoned, and we will defend your red heart to the death!

Most respected Chairman Mao! It was you who personally created and led the People's Liberation Army of China, which, under the direct command of Vice Chairman Lin, fought side by side with us in the most difficult times, and in the most dangerous moments, our hearts beat as one! Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, and nothing is as good as the PLA! The hearts of the proletarian revolutionaries and the PLA are connected, and the proletarian revolutionaries see the PLA as especially dear! Forever and ever, our hearts are connected, and we are especially dear!

The revolutionary people can never be separated from you—our heart's reddest red sun. At this moment when the revolutionary criticism is blazing like a fire within the Great Wall and the revolutionary unity is surging and roaring in the south of the Yangtze River, you have come to our side again. Each of your latest instructions is the greatest care and encouragement for us; each of your strategic deployments points out the direction for us to continue to advance.

Respected Chairman Mao! Looking back at the battle course, every victory we have achieved is the result of acting according to your instructions, and it is the crystallization nurtured by your brilliant thoughts. A thousand victories, ten thousand victories, all victories are due to you! "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We cannot express our boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to you! We are determined to continue to seize the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution with our fighting hands!

Respected Chairman Mao! At this moment of celebrating the birth of the revolutionary committee, we remember your teachings: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater and more arduous." We swear to you: We will definitely take your intimate comrade-in-arms, our Vice Chairman Lin, as a great example, forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your thoughts, forever loyal to your revolutionary line. We will definitely study your latest instructions well, resolutely carry out your latest instructions, earnestly propagate your latest instructions, and unswervingly defend your latest instructions.

Respected Chairman Mao! Your great program of "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" is the thousand-year and ten-thousand-year plan of the proletarian revolution. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, vigorously establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, continue to promote the revolutionary spirit of learning, and study and apply the "Old Five Articles" deeply, making a revolution in the depths of our souls, overthrowing the "self" of the bourgeoisie, and establishing the "public" of the proletariat, overthrowing the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and establishing proletarian party spirit, becoming a proletarian revolutionary who is determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Respected Chairman Mao! We will definitely, in accordance with your great teachings, carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently, promote and consolidate the revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units and departments, rectify the party organization, strengthen party building, and thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent in Hubei, Wang Renzhong, and others.

Respected Chairman Mao! Your great call of "supporting the army and loving the people" is an important guarantee for the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. We are determined to further strengthen military-civilian unity, building a steel wall to smash the fierce attacks of all class enemies at home and abroad. "Military and civilian unity as one, see who can defeat us?"

Respected Chairman Mao! You call for: "Grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness." We will definitely summon up our strength, strive to catch up, and make continuous efforts to achieve a double harvest of revolution and production!

Respected Chairman Mao! You teach us: "The enemy will not perish by itself." We will definitely never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget to highlight proletarian politics, never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be vigilant against the enemy's open and covert attacks, eliminate the old customs and habits of the bourgeoisie, and turn all of Hubei into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

"The seas are churning with clouds and water, and the winds and thunder are roaring in the five continents." Respected Chairman Mao! The world today has entered a new era with your thoughts as the beacon. Your great truth has won the enthusiastic admiration of the revolutionary people of the world, and your glorious banner is flying high in the five continents and four seas. Standing by the Yangtze River, with our hearts in China and our minds on the world, we swear to be international proletarian revolutionaries, together with the revolutionary people of all countries, to sweep away all the ghosts and snakes of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We wish you, our heart's reddest red sun, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

      毛主席啊，毛主席！在这红旗如林，欢声如潮的盛大节日里，大别山南，洞庭湖北，颗颗红心向太阳，纵情高歌《东方红》。我们高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向着北京，最最衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      长江波涛连天涌，九派水流有源头。毛主席啊，毛主席！回忆武汉的战斗航程，哪一回不是您亲自指引；翻开湖北的革命史册，哪一页不是用您的光辉思想写出的。
      敬爱的毛主席啊！是您，在中国人民灾难深重的日子里，拨开迷雾，在武昌举办了“中央农民运动讲习所”，写下了光耀日月的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，无情地痛斥了陈独秀及其追随者中国赫鲁晓夫的右倾投降主义，天才地提出了用枪杆子夺取政权的伟大真理，开创了以农村包围城市的胜利道路。

      “凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。正当两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死决战的关键时刻，顽固不化的走资派勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神，又一次进行了疯狂反扑。毛主席啊，毛主席！是您一次又一次地鼓舞我们冲破惊涛骇浪，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性的胜利。多少次我们向您宣誓：

  一道粉碎国内外一切阶级敌人的猖狂进攻的钢铁长城。“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”
    敬爱的毛主席！您号召：“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”。我们一定要鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，夺取革命和生产的双丰收！
    敬爱的毛主席啊！您教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”我们一定念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，警惕阶级敌人的明枪暗箭，扫除资产阶级的旧风俗、旧习惯，把全湖北办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
