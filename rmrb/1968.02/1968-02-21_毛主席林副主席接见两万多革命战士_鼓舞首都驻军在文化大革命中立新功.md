Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Receive Over 20,000 Revolutionary Soldiers
Inspiring the Capital's Troops to Achieve New Victories in the Cultural Revolution

The joyous news of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao receiving representatives from the Beijing Garrison, troops executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in Beijing, and soldiers from the 8341 Unit has greatly inspired the broad masses of soldiers and officers in the capital. In every camp and on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries," lively celebration activities are being held. Soldiers and officers unanimously expressed their eternal loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, their determination to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and their resolve to achieve new victories for the people in the struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

From last night until deep into the night today, the city and countryside of Beijing were filled with joy. Broad masses of soldiers and officers, together with revolutionary masses in the area, held meetings and discussions, enthusiastically cheering for Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary soldiers. Soldiers carried large portraits of Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, parading through the streets, holding celebratory processions. Wherever the joyous news spread, the people there enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The leadership of the Beijing Garrison held a grand celebration meeting last night. The venue was brightly lit, with drums and gongs echoing, and songs resonating. With hearts full of excitement, soldiers and officers sang "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao." They had just been received by the great leader Chairman Mao, their hearts surging with excitement. They presented red joyous bulletins, statements of resolve, and guarantees to the stage.

Leaders of the Beijing Garrison, including Fu Chongbi, Huang Zuozhen, Liu Shaowen, Liu Fu, Zhong Huikun, Li Zhongqi, Pan Yongti, Zeng Shaodong, Liu Guangfu, Ma Zhaomin, Fan Puquan, Bai Rugeng, Zhou Shuqing, Liu Bo, and Hou Debao, attended the celebration meeting. Fu Chongbi read the "Decision of the Beijing Garrison Party Committee on Warmly Celebrating the Great Leader Chairman Mao and His Close Comrade-in-Arms Vice Chairman Lin's Warm Reception, Promoting the Construction of the Army and All Work." The decision stated that the warm reception by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest spur for us. The decision requires all units to further launch a wave of studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to more extensively and deeply carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The decision emphasizes the need to adhere to the principle of "criticizing and repudiating oneself and criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key task, to establish and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, not only in the army but also to help factories, rural areas, schools, and neighborhoods. The decision calls for carrying forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Mao Zedong, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and focusing on the "application" aspect to thoroughly transform one's worldview.

The decision requires all soldiers and officers to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "support the leftist broad masses of the people" and "love the army and the people," and to resolutely complete the glorious tasks of the "three supports, two militaries." The decision emphasizes the need to firmly adhere to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, to help the broad revolutionary masses, to resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, to strengthen proletarian party spirit, to carry out a deeper revolutionary criticism, to consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, to boldly liberate revolutionary cadres, to actively promote the revolutionary tripartite alliance, to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit, to support, respect, and cherish the revolutionary committees, to seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

Representatives from the Beijing Garrison, including Yao Yuqi, and representatives from the 8341 Unit executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in Beijing, such as Gu Yuanxing from the Beijing Knitting General Factory, spoke at the meeting. They expressed their determination to respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call, to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. They vowed to more extensively propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, to implement and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On this joyous day, various units held different celebration activities. Soldiers and officers participating in the Beijing Garrison Mao Zedong Thought Study Class, along with their families, held celebration and discussion meetings throughout the night. Old Red Army soldiers, new cadres, and young soldiers gathered together, enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao's magnificent achievements and the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, speaking highly of Chairman Mao's affectionate care for revolutionary soldiers, and expressing their deep feelings of unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Representatives from the People's Armed Forces Department of Pinggu County returned to the county to report the joyous news immediately after seeing Chairman Mao and held a celebration meeting, expressing their firm resolve to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The 456 Unit immediately convened a party committee meeting to make a decision on propagating the joyous news, and various units immediately launched the "three discussions, three inspections" activities. Broad masses of soldiers and officers, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, discussed Chairman Mao's great wisdom, discussed the battles we have fought under Chairman Mao's leadership, and discussed the party and Chairman Mao's care and cultivation of us. The more they discussed, the more excited they became. They voluntarily examined themselves against high standards to see if their class feelings for Chairman Mao were deep enough, if they were closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and if they were quickly implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, making their red hearts redder and their loyal hearts more loyal.

Soldiers and officers on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries" quickly and enthusiastically spread the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception to factories, offices, schools, and rural areas in the capital, and held celebration activities with the revolutionary masses. The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Mao Zedong Thought Study Class, Beijing Knitting General Factory, Capital Steel Company, Caochangdi Middle School, and many people's communes in Daxing and Changping counties held celebration meetings. Military and civilian personnel jointly cheered for the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They identified gaps and formulated measures, determined to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve new victories in the struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
