The Chinese-Vietnamese Friendship Association held a report meeting today, extending the warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese people in the south for their resounding victories in the New Year offensive. It expressed the determination of the Chinese people to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and stand firmly behind the Vietnamese people, supporting them in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation to the very end.

Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, and responsible comrades from relevant departments, including Han Nianlong, Ding Xilin, Zhou Yiping, and representatives of the revolutionary masses of the capital, attended the meeting. Ambassador Vu Minh Quan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Nguyen Van Hoang, Deputy Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, also attended. Nguyen Van Hoang and Ambassador Vu Minh Quan were invited to speak at the meeting, introducing the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

As the meeting began, the revolutionary masses read Chairman Mao's quotations: "You are doing well! Under extremely difficult conditions, relying on your own strength, you have beaten the most ferocious U.S. imperialism into a state of utter helplessness and disarray, achieving a great victory. 'Persist and you will win.' I am deeply convinced that the Vietnamese people, by persevering in a protracted war, will surely drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam."

They also read President Ho Chi Minh's quotations: "The closer we get to victory, the more difficulties we will encounter. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more desperately. Therefore, our military and civilian forces must strengthen their unity, persist in the fight, strike hard, and strike continuously to achieve greater victories."

When Nguyen Van Hoang took the stage to deliver his report, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause, paying tribute to the heroic military and civilian forces of South Vietnam. Nguyen Van Hoang detailed the brilliant achievements of the South Vietnamese military and civilian forces in the New Year offensive. He told the audience that the South Vietnamese military and civilian forces are bravely and continuously fighting, attacking the American aggressors and their lackeys with an overwhelming force. The time for the South Vietnamese people to achieve a comprehensive victory has arrived.

Nguyen Van Hoang said that in the revolutionary storm, the armed forces and political power of the South Vietnamese people are rapidly growing and strengthening. People from all walks of life unanimously demand the overthrow of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique and the withdrawal of American troops and their puppet forces from South Vietnam.

He said that the general offensive launched by the South Vietnamese military and civilian forces has put the enemy in a state of severe defeat in military, political, strategic, and tactical terms. The enemy is now in a desperate situation. The victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian forces in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is a victory of the invincible people's war.

He pointed out that the revolutionary situation in South Vietnam is excellent, while in contrast, the contradictions within the American aggressors, the contradictions between the American aggressors and their puppet states, the contradictions between the American aggressors and their puppet regimes, and the contradictions within the puppet regimes are now more acute than ever.

Nguyen Van Hoang strongly condemned the American aggressors for indiscriminately bombing urban residential areas, even using poison gas to massacre the people. He pointed out that no matter how the American aggressors struggle, they cannot save themselves from their inevitable defeat.

He said, President Ho Chi Minh stated: "The New Year victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian forces has put our nation's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation in a new and very favorable situation. Nothing can save the American aggressors and their lackeys from complete collapse." The South Vietnamese military and civilian forces are fearless of sacrifice and will advance to inflict even heavier blows on the enemy, achieving a complete victory, liberating South Vietnam, and building an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Nguyen Van Hoang said, Chairman Mao, in his congratulatory telegram to President Nguyen Huu Tho, said: "The South Vietnamese people and all Vietnamese people can be assured that your struggle is our struggle. The 700 million Chinese people are the staunch supporters of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people."

Chairman Mao's heartfelt congratulatory words are the voice of the 700 million Chinese people. The firm support of the Chinese people is an important factor in the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese and Chinese peoples are fighting side by side in the same trench, and our fighting friendship will shine forever.

Ambassador Vu Minh Quan began his report to enthusiastic applause. He warmly hailed the New Year victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian forces, pointing out that this victory is a great victory for the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, paving the way for the South Vietnamese people to achieve final victory.

The ambassador said that as the people of the entire country's base in North Vietnam, in response to the call of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh, with the spirit of being prepared to fight for five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, we have implemented the Party's line of people's war, launched an unprecedented high tide of struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and achieved great victories on all fronts of production and combat. He said that we have taken to heart President Ho's teachings and are prepared for all possible situations. If the U.S. imperialists dare to expand the war to the north, we will give them even more severe punishment. To support the front and completely defeat the American aggressors, we will contribute all our strength.

Ambassador Vu Minh Quan said that the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people are inseparable from the enthusiastic support of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people under the leadership of the beloved Chairman Mao. At this moment of our new victories, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Premier Zhou Enlai, and people from all walks of life across China are encouraging our military and civilian forces to persist in the fight and decisively defeat the American aggressors. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the ambassador expressed sincere thanks to our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people. He wished the Chinese people even greater victories in socialist construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Ding Xilin, a member of the Chinese-Vietnamese Friendship Association, then spoke, expressing heartfelt thanks to the Vietnamese comrades for their inspiring reports and stating that the Chinese people must learn from the heroic Vietnamese people. He said that the resounding victories achieved by the Vietnamese people have sounded the clarion call of people's war, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary peoples of the world, greatly demoralizing U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and setting a brilliant example for the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to achieve liberation, creating a miracle in the history of world national liberation wars.

Ding Xilin said that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are determined to be the staunch supporters of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people have made all preparations and are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices to firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle to the end, until the last American aggressor is driven out of Vietnam.

After the report meeting, a film introducing the victories of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation in both the north and the south was shown.

    新华社十七日讯　中国越南友好协会今天举行报告会，最热烈地祝贺越南南方军民在新春全面出击中所取得的无比辉煌的胜利，表示中国人民坚决遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    郭沫若副委员长，各有关方面的负责人韩念龙、丁西林、周一萍和首都革命群众代表，同越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，副团长阮明芳，出席了报告会。阮文广团长和吴明鸾大使应邀先后在会上作报告，介绍了越南人民在抗美救国战争中所取得的伟大胜利。
    报告会开始，全场革命群众朗读毛主席语录：“你们打得好！你们在非常艰苦的条件下，依靠自己的力量，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，这是一个伟大的胜利。”“坚持下去就是胜利。我深信，越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。”朗读胡志明主席语录：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。因此，我们军民更要加强团结，坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利。”
    阮文广团长登上讲台作报告的时候，全场发出雷鸣般的掌声，表示向英雄的越南南方军民致敬。阮文广团长详细地介绍了越南南方军民在新春全面出击中所取得的辉煌战果，他并且告诉大家，越南南方军民正在勇猛地连续战斗，以排山倒海之势攻击美国强盗及其走狗。越南南方人民争取全面胜利的时机已经开始到来。
    阮文广说，在革命的风暴中，越南南方人民群众的武装力量和政治力量不断迅速地壮大和成长。各阶层人民一致提出打倒阮文绍—阮高其集团，要求美军及其帮凶军从越南南方滚出去。
    他说，越南南方军民发动的总进攻，已使敌人在军事上、政治上和战略上、战术上处于惨重的全面失败的局面。敌人已经陷入了走投无路的困境。越南军民抗美救国战争的胜利，是威力无穷的人民战争的胜利。
    他指出，越南南方人民的革命形势一片大好，与此相反，美国侵略者内部的矛盾，美国侵略者与帮凶国家之间的矛盾，美国侵略者与其走狗集团之间的矛盾，以及卖国集团之间的矛盾，现在比任何时候都更加尖锐。
    阮文广强烈谴责美国侵略者正在对城市居民区进行狂轰滥炸，甚至使用毒气，屠杀人民。他指出，美国侵略者不管如何挣扎，也挽救不了他们必遭惨败的命运。
    他说，胡志明主席说：“南方军民的新春大捷，使我们全国人民的抗美救国战争处于一个新的非常有利的形势。没有什么能够挽救美国强盗及其走狗的彻底崩溃。”越南南方军民决不怕牺牲，将乘胜前进，给敌人以更加沉重的打击，夺取彻底胜利，解放越南南方，建立独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一祖国。
    阮文广说，毛主席在给阮友寿主席的贺电中说：“兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”
    毛主席的这些充满深情厚意的贺词，是七亿中国人民的共同声音。中国人民对我们的坚决支持，是越南人民取得伟大胜利的一个重要因素。越中两国人民是在同一个战壕里进行战斗的战友，我们的战斗友谊将世世代代永放光芒。
    吴明鸾大使在热烈的掌声中开始报告。他热烈欢呼越南南方军民的新春大捷，指出这一胜利是越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领的巨大胜利，它为越南南方人民夺取最后的胜利开辟了道路。
    大使说，作为全国根据地的越南北方的人民，为实现劳动党和胡志明主席的号召，本着准备打五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间的战斗精神，贯彻执行了党的人民战争的路线，掀起了前所未有的抗美救国高潮，在生产和战斗的各条战线上都取得了巨大的胜利。他说，我们牢记胡主席的教导，已对将可能出现的各种情况做好了准备。如果美帝胆敢把战争扩大到北方来，我们将给它更加严厉的惩罚。为了支援前线，彻底打败美国强盗，我们将贡献出自己的一切力量。
    吴明鸾大使说，越南人民取得的巨大胜利，是与在敬爱的毛主席领导下的中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民的热情援助分不开的。在我们取得新的胜利的时候，毛主席、林彪副主席、周恩来总理，以及中国各地的各阶层人民，都在鼓励着我们军民坚持战斗，决战决胜美国强盗。大使代表越南劳动党中央和越南民主共和国政府，向我们伟大领袖毛主席，向中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民表示真诚的感谢。他最后祝中国人民在社会主义建设和无产阶级文化大革命中取得更加辉煌的胜利。
    中越友协理事丁西林接着讲话，衷心感谢越南战友所作的振奋人心的报告，并且表示中国人民一定要向英雄的越南人民学习。他说，越南人民所取得的震惊世界的辉煌胜利，是人民战争思想的响彻云霄的凯歌，它大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风，为世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放斗争树立了光辉的榜样，创立了世界民族解放战争史上的奇迹。
    丁西林说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，誓作兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾。中国人民已经作好一切准备，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持英雄的越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者一个不剩地赶出越南。
    报告会后，放映了介绍越南南北方人民抗美救国战争胜利的影片。
