Limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, forever follow Chairman Mao! This is the ironclad oath and fighting practice of millions upon millions of proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the PLA, Deputy Director of the Political Department of a certain communications station in the air force on the Fujian front, Feng Fusheng, has, over the past two years, risen from a cook to a leadership position. He is limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, emphasizes proletarian politics, and actively applies Chairman Mao's thoughts. He is an outstanding representative of the rapidly growing proletarian revolutionary cause in our army.

Leaders must be limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and emphasize Mao Zedong Thought

In July 1965, Feng Fusheng was transferred from the motorized transport company's kitchen to the supply department as deputy political instructor. Soon after, he became the political instructor. With a heart limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, he took up this leadership position with the determination to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position.

As soon as Feng Fusheng arrived at the supply department, he encountered a major problem: why had this department not been rated as a "four-good" unit for several years? Some leaders said it was because the "central task of three meals a day" was not solid. Many comrades, however, believed it was because the study and application of Chairman Mao's works were not solid. Feng Fusheng organized a debate on this issue. He and his comrades discussed facts and reasoning, and with questions, they sought guidance from Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said, "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Vice Chairman Lin said: First of all, one must truly master Mao Zedong Thought; this is the most important thing. Feng Fusheng used Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to unify everyone's thoughts, making those who had not previously understood the issue reach a common conclusion: the key is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively and be limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao.

A series of battles to uphold Mao Zedong Thought were launched.

Feng Fusheng first mobilized everyone to engage in extensive recollection and comparison, to speak extensively about Chairman Mao's great wisdom, and to discuss the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, fostering a deep class sentiment of limitless love for Chairman Mao and further enhancing everyone's consciousness in studying Chairman Mao's works.

He worked hard to promote and implement a series of policies, principles, and methods proposed by Vice Chairman Lin for the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, guiding everyone to "study with questions, apply actively, study and apply together, learn urgently when needed, see immediate results, and focus on the 'application'."

He went deep into the second canteen, cultivated models, held experience-sharing meetings, summarized experiences, and promptly promoted them.

He and his comrades studied the "Three Articles" as mottos, reaching a new level of understanding, and gaining a deeper comprehension of Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. This means:

	"Completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people means remembering Chairman Mao's great teachings on "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." Never forget class struggle, always hold the revolutionary gun and pen, and struggle to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	"Completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people means remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on "either the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevails over the East Wind; there is no room for compromise on the line issue." Stand firmly and clearly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and die to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	"Completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people means remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on "rebellion is justified," fostering the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, and striving to smash the entire old world thoroughly.

	"Completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people means remembering Chairman Mao's teachings in the "Sixteen Points" on "trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit," being willing to be a student of the masses, and forever being a servant of the people.

	"Completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people means remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on "the army advances, production increases by an inch, discipline is strengthened, and revolution is invincible," strengthening revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline.

	"Completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people means remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation," using the "Three Articles" as a weapon, thoroughly criticizing and eliminating selfishness, and establishing a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind.

Feng Fusheng carried out ideological and political work on every individual, reaching every heart with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, making every comrade's heart red.

Old worker Gu Bingren worked diligently, but his consciousness in studying Chairman Mao's works was not strong. In the evaluation in early 1966, he was not rated as a "five-good" worker. Feng Fusheng felt he had not helped Gu Bingren well and had not fulfilled his responsibility.

Feng Fusheng, with deep proletarian feelings, went to Gu Bingren's home and had an intimate talk with him. They discussed the hardships of the old society, the happiness of the new society, and how Chairman Mao led all Chinese laborers to stand up. They talked about how Chairman Mao's books are the lifeblood of the proletarian revolution, the root of all roots, and the thousand roots, and must be grasped in the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Gu Bingren nodded repeatedly as he listened to Feng Fusheng. Before leaving, Feng Fusheng took out a copy of "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works," a notebook, a pencil, and a pair of old glasses from his bag and gave them to Gu Bingren. The fifty-three-year-old Gu Bingren was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes. He held Feng Fusheng's hand and said, "Director, I have not studied Chairman Mao's works well, and I have let Chairman Mao down. I will learn from you, put the study of Chairman Mao's works first, and be like you, limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao."

From then on, Gu Bingren got up early every day, put on his old glasses, held Chairman Mao's works, and read and wrote sentence by sentence, word by word. The more he read, the more he loved and believed in Chairman Mao; the more he wrote, the more he admired and was loyal to Chairman Mao. He decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, dedicating everything to Chairman Mao. Half a year later, Gu Bingren became an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the supply department and was rated as a "five-good" worker at the end of the year.

Feng Fusheng enthusiastically helped his comrades plant Mao Zedong Thought deeply in their hearts, making the entire supply department present a new situation of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and forging red hearts limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao. A batch of new people who "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people grew rapidly. Among them were Wang Yujian, who delivered water for the revolution and propagated Mao Zedong Thought wherever he went, becoming the "Red Propagandist"; Zhou Zunda, who raised cows for the revolution and studied Mao Zedong Thought wherever he went, becoming the "Warrior Philosopher"; Li Jinqiang, Li Fengdai, Wei Cunsheng, Wang Zhenping, and others who actively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, learning a little and applying a little, doing everything for the revolution.

Feng Fusheng turned one red spot into many red spots, and many red spots into a vast red expanse.

Mao Zedong Thought was implemented in the supply department, and this department was rated as a "four-good" unit for two consecutive years, becoming an advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works in the air force on the Fujian front.

Leaders must be limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

"In the historical stage of socialism, class, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist, and there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads." Feng Fusheng firmly remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's enlightened teachings. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the great struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, he held an unshakable belief: following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory. He was limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and bravely joined the struggle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. From revolutionary practice, he deeply felt that the primary responsibility of leaders is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arm the broad masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and in the great waves of class struggle, lead the broad masses to advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The leadership position must be a fighting position to firmly defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

As soon as the great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Feng Fusheng wrote in an article with revolutionary passion: "The most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, it is you who pointed out the direction for us to advance; it is you who opened the path to victory for us. No matter how great the storms and waves we encounter on the revolutionary road, as long as you give the order, we dare to climb the knife mountain and leap into the fire sea, for the thorough victory of the Chinese revolution and world revolution, and for the thorough liberation of all humanity, we will forever charge to the forefront."

Chairman Mao cared for and supported the Red Guards movement, and Feng Fusheng immediately took action, leading his comrades to love and support the Red Guards everywhere, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. He posted Red Guards propaganda posters all over the camp, speaking extensively about the great achievements of the Red Guards. On the eve of the "January Revolution" red storm sweeping the country, when the young Red Guards going south to link up were attacked and suppressed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, he stood up and shouted, "Attacking the Red Guards is attacking the revolution!" He firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, studying Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary young guards and fighting shoulder to shoulder. The revolutionary young guards were deeply moved, pinning Chairman Mao's badges on Feng Fusheng and his comrades' chests, giving them Red Guards armbands, and saying excitedly, "You brought us the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, you brought us the greatest care and support from Chairman Mao, we will definitely learn from the PLA, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The great leader Chairman Mao issued the great battle call to "shell the headquarters," and Feng Fusheng immediately joined the battle to thoroughly smash the capitalist headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. He said, "At this critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, a second's hesitation is disloyalty to Chairman Mao and unworthy of being a warrior defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." When he heard the battle call to criticize China's Khrushchev on the radio, he wrote an article denouncing China's Khrushchev overnight: "Dare to pull the emperor off the horse, even if one's body is sliced to pieces." Feng Fusheng had just written the title when the branch committee members arrived. Feng Fusheng raised his fist firmly and said, "Comrades, you came at the right time! Let us together take up the pen as a sword and write this denunciation of China's Khrushchev." They immediately convened a branch committee meeting, and everyone was furious, deciding to convene an oath-taking rally to launch a total attack on China's Khrushchev that night. At this time, suddenly a heavy rain poured down. One phone call after another came, asking, "The wind and rain outside are fierce, should the oath-taking rally be held in the rain?" Feng Fusheng answered decisively, "On time! Overthrowing China's Khrushchev is the most important thing, even if it means cutting with a knife, it must be held!" Feng Fusheng did not sleep all night, writing the mobilization outline for the revolutionary criticism overnight. At four in the morning, the entire supply department assembled and set up the battlefield to denounce China's Khrushchev in the camp. At the oath-taking rally, Feng Fusheng angrily exposed China's Khrushchev's crimes of plotting to restore capitalism to everyone, explaining the great significance of launching this battle. China's Khrushchev's crimes aroused the intense hatred of the revolutionary warriors. From that day on, the supply department's revolutionary criticism special edition and mobile bulletin boards were in full swing. Article after article of criticism, like angry cannonballs, were fired at China's Khrushchev.

Scars from knives and whips will not fade, class hatred will never be forgotten. Wherever Feng Fusheng went, he stood on the front line of revolutionary criticism. Last May, after being transferred to the political department of a certain communications station, he returned home for a matter. He returned to his hometown and joined the local military and civilians in launching a total attack on China's Khrushchev. In thirty days, he gave twenty-five reports criticizing China's Khrushchev to the revolutionary masses within dozens of miles.

One day, Feng Fusheng crossed from the south bank of the Yangtze River to the north bank of a farm to participate in a meeting criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious." When the meeting ended, the last ferry had already departed. What to do? Feng Fusheng, thinking about the meeting to be held in the south the next morning, firmly declined the revolutionary masses' invitation to stay and took a small boat, facing the wind and waves, sailing to the new battlefield in the south overnight.

Feng Fusheng was like this, charging fiercely on the battlefield of revolutionary criticism, making new contributions to smashing the capitalist headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Leaders must be limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and forever maintain the character of an ordinary laborer

In two years, Feng Fusheng rose from a cook to a leadership position in the political department of a regiment. Would he set up a framework to be an official, or would he continue to maintain the character of an ordinary laborer? This was another test for him.

As soon as Feng Fusheng took up the leadership position, he repeatedly studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people." He said, "Becoming a cadre, the position has changed, but the character of an ordinary laborer must never change."

One day, Feng Fusheng went to the kitchen with the old cook Pan Shisong to wash dishes. As they washed and talked, Pan Shisong suddenly asked, "Deputy Director, you've become a cadre, with so many things to do, you still wash dishes?" This question made Feng Fusheng think deeply: why did the old comrade who had worked at the same stove for six years now distance himself so much from the cooks? Why did the old comrades no longer call him "Fusheng" but always "Deputy Director"? Why did they say, "Deputy Director, don't interfere, rest a bit!" when he just wanted to help with the work? He thought about this while looking at Pan Shisong, carefully observing whether the comrades intentionally distanced themselves from him or whether he had distanced himself from the comrades. Indeed, he saw the problem: Pan Shisong was wearing work clothes, with both sleeves rolled up high, working with all his might. He himself was not wearing work clothes, and his sleeves were not rolled up high, looking nothing like someone who was working. This comparison shocked Feng Fusheng.

That night, he reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on cadres being ordinary laborers, and his mind became clear. He felt that whether he worked like an ordinary laborer was a matter of whether he was implementing Chairman Mao's teachings correctly or not. He deeply felt, "Becoming a cadre, there can be no special treatment, special treatment means alienation from the masses, special treatment means forgetting the revolution, special treatment means disloyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The next day, in addition to the shining "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in his bag, he also had a set of cook's work clothes. He went to the kitchen to work, just like his old comrades. The cooks all said, "Fusheng is still our old commander."

Feng Fusheng regarded participating in labor and maintaining the character of an ordinary laborer as a major matter after becoming a cadre. He went to the kitchen and worked as a cook, went to the countryside and worked as a community member, got on the train and worked as a conductor, stayed at the reception center and worked as a receptionist. He worked wherever he went, continuously and unceasingly. The soldiers saw that his burden was getting heavier and heavier, and they said with concern, "You are too tired, we will take care of all the labor." Feng Fusheng replied, "You can take care of the labor, but you cannot take care of the thought revolutionization of cadres. This labor position is an anti-revisionism position, a position to learn from the masses, a position to be limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, I can never leave this position."

Feng Fusheng connected with the masses through labor and learned from the masses through labor. He said, "The masses are the true heroes. The masses' experience is the richest, most practical, and most specific. Becoming a cadre, the position has changed, but the attitude of being a small student must not change at all." Once, Feng Fusheng criticized a supply worker, and the supply worker did not accept the criticism in a humble manner but instead retorted at Feng Fusheng. At that time, Feng Fusheng's face was hot, and he did not say anything, but he felt that he could not bear it. This incident caused Feng Fusheng to have a fierce struggle in his thoughts. He thought: why did a soldier's unpleasing word make him feel "unbearable"? Why did he never have this feeling when he was the commander of the kitchen? Chairman Mao's teachings flashed before his eyes: "Regarding the different opinions raised by subordinates, one must be able to listen patiently and consider them, and not get angry just because one hears different opinions, thinking that one is not respected." He finally found the answer in the depths of his soul: he had become a cadre, and his thoughts had produced a sense of superiority, unconsciously placing himself "on stage" and the masses "below stage," and once he "went on stage," he felt that the masses did not respect him. This is a dangerous "stage," it is the stage of officialdom, it is the stage of alienation from the masses, and this "stage" must not be climbed. Climbing up this "stage" will lead to a complete collapse. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, Feng Fusheng immediately "came down from the stage" and checked his own thoughts with the supply worker. The supply worker was very moved and also admitted his shortcomings and mistakes, expressing his determination to correct them. Feng Fusheng humbly listened to the masses' opinions, and the masses were willing to tell him anything.

Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions to "solve the problem of superior-subordinate relations well and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses." Feng Fusheng immediately traveled dozens of miles to propagate the latest instructions to five soldiers maintaining telephone lines. As soon as he entered the door, he said to the soldiers, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us in the latest instructions: 'In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience.' Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I am here to learn from you comrades." He then had an intimate conversation with the soldiers, asking them to help him study how to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and improve superior-subordinate relations. The soldiers proposed many good measures, and Feng Fusheng treasured them like precious gems, taking notes and praising them. The soldiers proposed: cadres should not only live, eat, and work with the soldiers in life, but more importantly, they should also fight against selfishness and revisionism together politically, recall bitterness and sweetness together, care for the soldiers politically, and cultivate them into communist successors. This is the greatest love for the soldiers. Feng Fusheng wrote down the soldiers' words in his notebook and decided to implement them in action. He said excitedly, "You gave me a vivid lesson on officer-soldier relations. You are forever my teachers, and I am forever your student." In the soldiers' minds, Feng Fusheng was their good leader and good comrade, and in Feng Fusheng's mind, the soldiers were forever his good teachers.

Feng Fusheng always appeared in the character of an ordinary laborer, forever maintaining a frugal and simple style. He used most of the savings from his salary to buy shining "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and Chairman Mao badges, giving them to the soldiers and presenting them to the revolutionary masses. The cadres and soldiers who worked with Feng Fusheng unanimously praised him, saying: Feng Fusheng is limitlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, doing everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and setting a good example for us to learn from.

Feng Fusheng deeply felt from his two years of leadership work that to take over the proletarian revolutionary cause, one must achieve "five musts and four unchanging," which are:

	Follow the great leader Chairman Mao without leaving his side,
	Actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works without stopping,
	Propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought without wasting a second,
	Defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line firmly and unshakably,
	Implement the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions without the slightest deviation;
	The position has changed, but the character of an ordinary laborer has not changed,
	The status has changed, but the attitude of being a small student of the masses has not changed,
	The treatment has changed, but the frugal and simple style has not changed,
	No matter how much it changes, the class feelings for Chairman Mao's works and the red heart loyal to Chairman Mao will never change!

    无限忠于毛主席，永远紧跟毛主席
    ——记全军学习毛主席著作积极分子丰福生
    无限忠于毛主席，坚持在一切领域里以毛泽东思想挂帅！这是千千万万决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派的钢铁誓言和战斗实践。
    全军学习毛主席著作积极分子、福建前线空军某部通信站政治处副主任丰福生，两年多来从炊事班长走上领导工作岗位。他无限忠于毛主席，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，是我军飞速成长的无产阶级革命事业接班人的一个优秀代表。
    领导干部必须无限忠于毛主席，突出毛泽东思想
    一九六五年七月，丰福生从汽车连炊事班被调到给养科当副指导员。不久，又当了指导员。他怀着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，带着让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地的决心，走上了这个领导工作岗位。
    丰福生一到给养科，就遇到了一个大问题：这个科几年没有评上四好，是什么原因？个别领导同志说，是因为“一日三餐的中心工作”不过硬。许多同志则认为，是活学活用毛主席著作不过硬。丰福生组织大家就这个问题展开辩论。他和同志们一起摆事实，讲道理，带着问题请示毛主席。毛主席说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”林副主席说：首先必须把毛泽东思想真正学到手，这是最紧要的。丰福生用毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示统一了大家的思想，使原来认识不清的同志，也得出了共同的结论：关键是要活学活用毛泽东思想，要无限忠于毛主席。
    一场场大立毛泽东思想的战斗展开了。
    丰福生首先发动大家大搞回忆对比，大讲毛主席的英明伟大，大谈毛泽东思想的无比威力，培养大家无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情，进一步提高大家学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    他努力宣传和贯彻林副主席提出的活学活用毛泽东思想的一系列方针、原则和方法，引导大家“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”
    他深入到第二食堂，培养典型，召开讲用会，总结经验，及时推广。
    他和同志们一起，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，学出了新水平，对毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，有了更深刻的理解，这就是：
      “完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就要牢记毛主席关于“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的伟大教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，永远紧握革命的枪杆子和笔杆子，为巩固和加强无产阶级专政而斗争。
      “完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就要牢记毛主席关于“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地”的教导，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明地站在毛主席革命路线一边，生为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身。
      “完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就要牢记毛主席关于“造反有理”的教导，发扬敢想，敢说，敢干的革命造反精神，为彻底砸烂整个旧世界而奋斗。
      “完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就要牢记毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中关于“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神”的教导，甘当群众的小学生，永远当人民的勤务员。
      “完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就要牢记毛主席关于“军队向前进，生产长一寸，加强纪律性，革命无不胜”的教导，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
      “完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就要牢记毛主席关于“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”的教导，以“老三篇”为武器，大造“私”字的反，夺“私”字的权，在头脑里树立一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界。
    丰福生把思想政治工作做到每一个人的身上，做到每一个人的心里，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，照红每一个同志的心。
    老职工顾炳仁，工作勤勤恳恳，但是学习毛主席著作的自觉性不够，一九六六年初评时没有评上五好。丰福生觉得自己没有帮助好顾炳仁，自己没有尽到责任。
    丰福生满怀着深厚的无产阶级感情来到顾炳仁家，同顾炳仁促膝谈心。他俩从旧社会的苦难，谈到新社会的幸福，谈到毛主席他老人家领导全中国劳动人民翻了身，毛主席的书是无产阶级革命的命根子，千根本，万根本，一定要抓住活学活用毛主席著作这个根本。顾炳仁听着丰福生的话，连连点头。临走，丰福生从挎包里拿出一本《毛泽东著作选读》，一个笔记本，一支铅笔，还有一副老花眼镜，送给顾炳仁。五十三岁的顾炳仁激动得热泪盈眶，他拉着丰福生的手说：“指导员，我没有学好毛主席著作，对不起毛主席他老人家，我一定向你学习，把学习毛主席著作放在第一位，象你一样，无限忠于毛主席。”
    从此，顾炳仁每天起早贪黑，戴上老花眼镜，捧着毛主席著作，一句句地读，一字字地写。越读对毛主席越热爱、越信仰，越写对毛主席越崇拜、越忠诚。他决心按照毛主席的教导，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，为毛主席献出自己的一切。半年后，顾炳仁成了给养科学习毛主席著作积极分子，年终被评为五好职工。
    丰福生就是这样热情地帮助同志们把毛泽东思想扎根在心坎里，使整个给养科出现了活学活用毛泽东思想，大炼无限忠于毛主席的红心的新局面，一批“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的新人迅速成长。先后出现了一心为革命送水，送水到哪里，就把毛泽东思想宣传到哪里的“红色宣传员”王玉见；一心为革命养牛，放牛到哪里，就在哪里学习毛泽东思想的“战士哲学家”周遵达；活学活用毛泽东思想，学一点，用一点，做到一心为革命的李金强、李凤岱、魏存胜、王祯平……
    丰福生使一点红变成点点红，使点点红变成一片红。
    毛泽东思想在给养科落实了，这个科连续两年被评为四好单位，成为福建前线空军部队学习毛主席著作的先进集体。
    领导干部必须无限忠于毛主席，勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线
    “在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争”。丰福生牢记伟大领袖毛主席的这一英明教导。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中，他怀着一个最坚定的信念：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利。他无限忠于毛主席，勇敢地投入捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的斗争。从革命斗争实践中，他深深体会到，领导者首要的责任，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装广大群众，在阶级斗争的大风浪里，身体力行，带领广大群众沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。领导岗位必须是坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战斗岗位。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动一开始，丰福生就满怀革命激情地在一篇文章里写道：“最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，是您，给我们指出了前进的方向；是您，为我们开辟了通向胜利的航道。不管在革命道路上会碰到多大险风恶浪，只要您一声令下，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，为中国革命和世界革命的彻底胜利，为全人类的彻底解放，永远冲锋在最前方。”
    毛主席关怀和支持红卫兵运动，丰福生立即行动，带领战友们处处热爱和支持红卫兵，热情颂扬红卫兵的革命行动。他在营区到处张贴红卫兵宣传画，大讲红卫兵的丰功伟绩。在“一月革命”红色风暴席卷全国的前夜，当南下串连的红卫兵小将遭到党内一小撮走资派围攻、打击的时刻，他挺身而出，大喝一声：“打击红卫兵就是打击革命！”他坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，同革命小将一起学习毛主席著作，并肩战斗。红卫兵革命小将们热泪盈眶，一边把毛主席像章别在丰福生和他的战友们的胸前，给他们佩带红卫兵袖章，一边激动地说：“你们给我们送来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给我们送来了毛主席他老人家的最大关怀，最大支持，我们一定要学习解放军，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。”
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“炮打司令部”的伟大战斗号令，丰福生当即投入彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的战斗。他说：“在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，一秒钟的犹豫就是对毛主席不忠，就不配做一个捍卫毛主席革命路线的战士。”当他从广播里听到批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战斗号令后，他连夜挥笔写声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的檄文：《舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马》。丰福生刚把题目写好，支委们来了。丰福生挥起拳头坚定地说：“同志们来得好！让我们共同拿起笔作刀枪，写这一篇声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的檄文。”他们当即召开支委会，大家一个个怒火万丈，决定连夜召开全科向中国赫鲁晓夫发动总攻击的誓师大会。这时，突然下起瓢泼大雨。一阵阵电话铃响了，有人打电话问：“外边风雨正大，誓师大会要不要冒雨召开？”丰福生果断地回答：“按时开！打倒中国赫鲁晓夫是头等重要的大事，就是下刀子也要开！”丰福生通宵没有合眼，连夜写出革命大批判的动员提纲。清晨四点钟，给养科全体集合，在营区里摆开了声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。丰福生在誓师大会上向大家愤怒地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫阴谋复辟资本主义的罪行，说明了发起这场战斗的重大意义。中国赫鲁晓夫的一条条罪状，激起革命战士的无比仇恨。从这一天开始，给养科的革命大批判专刊、流动墙报，如火如荼。一篇篇批判文章，象一颗颗愤怒的炮弹，射向中国赫鲁晓夫。
    刀伤鞭痕不会脱，阶级仇恨永不忘。丰福生不论走到哪里，都站在革命大批判的第一线。去年五月间，丰福生调任某部通信站政治处副主任后，因事回家，他回到家乡又投入当地军民向中国赫鲁晓夫发动总攻击的战斗。三十天中，他向周围数十里的革命群众做了二十五场批判中国赫鲁晓夫的报告。
    一天，丰福生从长江南岸来到江北的一个农场，参加批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”反革命谬论的大会。大会结束时，最后一班轮渡已经起航了。怎么办？丰福生一心想着第二天清晨还要参加在江南举行的另一个大会，便毅然谢绝了农场革命群众的挽留，坐着小舢板，迎着风浪，连夜驶向江南的新战场。
    丰福生就是这样，在革命大批判的战场上猛打猛冲，为摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线立下了新功。
    领导干部必须无限忠于毛主席，永远保持普通劳动者的本色
    在两年的时间里，丰福生从炊事班长到担任团政治处的领导职务，是摆开架子当官呢？还是继续保持普通劳动者的本色？这对他是又一个考验。
    丰福生一走上领导岗位，就反复学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”他说：“当了干部，职务变了，普通劳动者的本色永远不能变。”
    一天，丰福生下伙房跟老炊事员潘师松一起洗碗。两个人洗着说着，潘师松突然问道：“副指导员，你当了干部，事那么多，还洗碗？”这句话引起了丰福生的深思：为什么过去在一个灶边干了六年的老战友，现在把自己和炊事员分得那么远？为什么老战友们见面不喊“福生”了，开口闭口尽是“副指导员”？为什么进了伙房刚要插手干活，有的战友就说：“副指导员，别插手啦，休息休息吧！”他一边想，一边望着潘师松，仔细观察到底是同志们有意同自己疏远呢？还是自己和同志们疏远了呢？果然看出了问题：潘师松穿着工作服，两只袖子卷得老高，干起活来浑身是劲。自己没穿工作服，袖子也卷得不高，哪儿象个干活的样子？这一比，丰福生吃了一惊。
    夜里，他重温了毛主席关于干部是普通劳动者的教导，心里豁然开朗，他觉得自己干起活来象不象一个普通劳动者，是贯彻执行毛主席的教导走样不走样的问题。他深有体会地说：“当了干部，来不得半点特殊，特殊就要脱离群众，特殊就要忘记革命，特殊就是对伟大领袖毛主席不忠！”
    第二天，他的挎包里除了金光闪闪的毛主席著作以外，又多了一件炊事员工作服，下伙房干活，和老战友们一个样。炊事员们都说：“福生仍然是我们的老班长。”
    丰福生把参加劳动，保持普通劳动者的本色，看成是当干部后的一件大事。他下伙房就当炊事员，下农村就当社员，上火车就当列车员，住招待所就当招待员。他走到哪里就劳动到哪里，经常不断。战士们看到他肩上的担子越来越重，关切地说：“你太累了，劳动活我们全包啦。”丰福生回答说：“劳动活你们可以包下来，但不能把干部的思想革命化都包下来。这劳动的岗位，是防修反修的岗位，是向群众学习的岗位，是无限忠于毛主席的岗位，我永远不能离开这个岗位。”
    丰福生在劳动中联系群众，在劳动中向群众学习。他说：“群众是真正的英雄。群众的经验最丰富、最实际、最具体。当了干部，地位变了，甘当小学生的态度一丝一毫不能变。”有一次，丰福生批评了一位给养员，给养员没有虚心接受批评，反而顶了丰福生。当时，丰福生脸上火辣辣的，嘴里没说什么，心里却感到下不了台。这件事引起丰福生思想的激烈斗争，他想：为什么战士说一句不顺耳的话，自己就觉得“下不了台”呢？为什么以前当炊事班长从来没有这种感觉呢？毛主席的教导闪现在他的眼前：“对于下级所提出的不同意见，要能够耐心听完，并且加以考虑，不要一听到和自己不同的意见就生气，认为是不尊重自己。”他终于在灵魂深处找到了答案：自己当上了干部，思想上产生了优越感，无形中把自己摆在“台上”，把群众摆在“台下”，自己“上台”了，就觉得群众不尊重自己。这可是个危险的“台”，这是官气的“台”，是脱离群众的“台”，这个“台”万万上不得。沿着这个“台”往上爬就要彻底垮台。按照毛主席的教导，丰福生立即自动“下台”，找给养员检查了自己的思想。给养员很受感动，也承认了自己的缺点错误，表示坚决改正。丰福生虚心倾听群众的意见，群众有什么话都愿意向他讲。
    毛主席发出要“很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系”的最新指示。丰福生立即赶了几十里地，去向五个维护电话线路的战士宣传最新指示。他一进门就向战士们说：“我们伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中教导我们：‘在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。’遵循毛主席的教导，我是来向同志们学习的。”说罢，就和战士们亲切地谈了起来，请战士们帮助他一起研究如何落实毛主席的最新指示，搞好上下级关系。战士们提出了许多好措施，丰福生如获至宝，边记边叫好。战士们提出：干部不但在生活上要和战士同吃同住同劳动，而且更重要的是在政治上和战士共同斗私批修，共同忆苦思甜，从政治上关心战士成长，把战士培养成为共产主义接班人。这才是最大的爱兵。丰福生把战士们的话记在本子上，决心落实到行动上。他激动地说：“你们给我上了一堂生动的官兵关系课。你们永远是我的老师，我永远是你们的小学生。”在战士心目中，丰福生是他们的好领导、好战友，而在丰福生的心中，战士永远是他的好老师。
    丰福生处处以普通劳动者的身份出现，永远保持艰苦朴素的作风。他把节省下的薪金，大部分用来购买金光闪闪的毛主席著作、毛主席像章，送给战士，赠给革命群众。和丰福生一起工作的干部、战士同声称赞说：丰福生无限忠于毛主席，处处按照毛主席的指示办事，给我们树立了学习的好榜样。
    丰福生从两年多来担任领导工作中深深体会到，要接好无产阶级革命事业的班，就要做到“五要四不变”，这就是：
    紧跟伟大领袖毛主席要寸步不离，
    活学活用毛主席著作要永不停息，
    宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想要分秒必争，
    捍卫毛主席的革命路线要坚定不移，
    执行伟大领袖毛主席的指示要丝毫不走样；
    职务变了，普通劳动者的本色不变，
    地位变了，当群众小学生的态度不变，
    待遇变了，艰苦朴素的作风不变，
    千变万变，对毛主席著作的阶级感情和忠于毛主席的红心永不变！
