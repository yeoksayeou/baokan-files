Reported by this newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency, the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe concluded their visit and performance in Somalia, taking with them the deep friendship of the Somali people for the 700 million Chinese people and their respect for the great leader Chairman Mao. They departed Mogadishu on January 25. The Red East Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Somalia on December 18 last year. The troupe performed 20 shows in Mogadishu and nine other cities for 70,000 spectators, receiving a warm welcome.

The Somali people regard the Chinese artists as their relatives and friends. They said, "The cultural warriors of Mao Zedong have brought us new art born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." "We have drawn a lot of strength from the performances." During the performances, the audience often raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of Somalia and China!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong ten thousand times!" "Down with American imperialism!" The enthusiastic crowd sometimes surrounded the Chinese artists, asking for Chairman Mao's badges and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

On the morning of January 24, Somali Republic President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke received the entire Chinese song and dance troupe at the presidential palace. He, on behalf of the Somali people and government, congratulated the Chinese artists on their successful visit and performance in Somalia, and asked the Chinese song and dance troupe to convey his greetings to the Chinese people and government.

The Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, by plane on the morning of January 27. The troupe is visiting Pakistan for performances as part of the Sino-Pakistan cultural exchange plan.

On the evening of February 1, the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe held their first performance in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. The revolutionary songs and dances that emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China were enthusiastically received by the audience.

During the performance, all the items reflecting the love of the Chinese people and the people of the world for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, celebrating the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples, were enthusiastically received by the audience.

A Pakistani friend named Ashraf wrote in the guest book, "I hope that all the people of the world will study the great Mao Zedong Thought and be able to sing such beautiful songs as you sing." A university student said that the performance of the Red East Song and Dance Troupe reflected the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art.

    索马里和巴基斯坦人民热烈欢迎我东方红歌舞团的访问演出
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：中国东方红歌舞团结束对索马里的访问演出，带着索马里人民对七亿中国人民的深厚友谊和对伟大领袖毛主席的敬爱，在一月二十五日离开摩加迪沙。东方红歌舞团是去年十二月十八日到达索马里的。歌舞团在索马里首都摩加迪沙和其它九个城市里共为七万名观众演出了二十场，受到热烈欢迎。
    索马里人民把中国艺术家看作是他们的亲人和朋友。他们说，“毛泽东的文艺战士给我们带来了在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的新艺术。”“我们从演出中汲取了很多的力量。”在演出时，观众常常振臂高呼：“索中两国人民友好万岁！”“毛泽东主席万万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”热情的人们有时还围住中国艺术家，向他们索取毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》。
    一月二十四日上午，索马里共和国总统阿卜迪拉希德·阿里·舍马克在总统府接见了中国歌舞团全体成员。他代表索马里人民和政府祝贺中国艺术家们在索马里访问演出的成功，并请中国歌舞团向中国人民和政府转达他的问候。
    二十一日，中国驻索马里大使馆临时代办郑佩堂曾举行招待会，为东方红歌舞团送行。索马里国民议会议长谢赫·穆克塔尔等两百四十多人出席了招待会。
    中国东方红歌舞团一月二十七日上午乘飞机抵达巴基斯坦最大的城市卡拉奇。歌舞团是根据中巴文化交流执行计划来巴基斯坦进行访问演出的。
    中国东方红歌舞团二月一日晚间在巴基斯坦第一大城市卡拉奇举行首次演出。在中国无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命歌舞节目，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    在演出中，所有反映中国人民和世界人民对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的热爱、欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命和亚非人民反帝斗争的胜利的节目，都受到观众的热烈欢迎。当歌舞团用乌尔都语演唱巴基斯坦人民在印度反动派向巴基斯坦发动武装进攻期间最爱唱的两支歌曲的时候，观众发出了极其热烈的掌声。
    观众中一位叫阿舒拉夫的巴基斯坦朋友在留言簿上写道：“我希望全世界人民都学习伟大的毛泽东思想，都能够唱你们所唱的那样美好的歌曲。”一位大学生说，东方红歌舞团的演出反映了中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，反映了毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利。
    中国驻卡拉奇总领事馆领事沈培文一月三十一日为东方红歌舞团的访问演出举行招待会。卡拉奇文艺界和其他各界知名人士出席了招待会。中国驻巴基斯坦大使馆临时代办徐英也出席了这次招待会和歌舞团的首次演出的开幕式。
