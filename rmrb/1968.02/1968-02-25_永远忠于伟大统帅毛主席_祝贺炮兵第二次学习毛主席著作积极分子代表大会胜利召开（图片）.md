Ever Loyal to the Great Helmsman Chairman Mao

Celebrating the Successful Opening of the Second Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works in the Artillery

The masses praise Comrade Yu Chun, the political commissar of the garrison office of a certain artillery unit, as a "good cadre of Chairman Mao" and a "living Comrade Jiao Yulu." During the revolutionary war, he performed many great deeds for the people. In the period of socialist revolution, he followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "not relying on past merits, but creating new ones," hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle in all work, turning the garrison office into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. The picture shows Comrade Yu Chun propagating Mao Zedong Thought to family members.

Comrade Wang Kejing, deputy political instructor of a certain artillery unit, with boundless class feelings of love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, does as Chairman Mao says. Wang Kejing said, "Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is a lifelong combat mission for a revolutionary soldier and a sacred mission bestowed by history. Whoever relaxes the study of Chairman Mao's works is not a true revolutionary." This is Comrade Wang Kejing sharing his experiences of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works with comrades from other units.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives attending the Second Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works in the Artillery, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically discuss their experiences of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle." Comrade Zha Shunyi, the former comrade-in-arms of Martyr Dong Cunrui and deputy political commissar of the logistics department of a certain artillery unit, follows Chairman Mao's teachings, maintaining the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army for over a decade. He has achieved the following: despite his high position, his revolutionary spirit as a common soldier remains unchanged; despite his improved living conditions, his tradition of hard work and simplicity remains unchanged; despite his numerous honors, his humble and cautious attitude remains unchanged; despite his advanced age, his vigorous revolutionary spirit remains unchanged. In short, no matter how things change, his resolve to follow Chairman Mao remains unshakable; no matter how the world changes, his red heart loyal to Chairman Mao remains unchanged. This is Comrade Zha Shunyi having a friendly conversation with poor and lower-middle peasants in the Beijing suburb of Shuangqiao Commune.

Comrade Luo Xiangkuan, a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought from a certain artillery unit, during his "three supports, two militaries" mission in the Luoyang Bearing Factory, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, insisted on the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions," held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and helped revolutionary masses actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. He vigorously promoted the thought revolutionization of the responsible persons of the two revolutionary mass organizations, making the two major revolutionary mass organizations, which were in severe opposition, quickly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve revolutionary great unity. This is him studying Chairman Mao's quotations with the workers.

The artillery unit's propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the broad revolutionary masses in the Beijing Foreign Language Printing Factory, earnestly implemented the principle of "supporting the left without supporting factions," promoted the revolution, and boosted production. The entire factory achieved revolutionary great unity and established a revolutionary committee. Currently, the entire factory presents a revolutionary scene of surging enthusiasm, with production increasing several times, becoming a red bastion for propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the world. This is the support-left comrades studying and deeply implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "promoting the revolution and boosting production" with the workers.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the artillery direct-affiliated organs, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, studied the issue of further deepening the great criticism, vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
