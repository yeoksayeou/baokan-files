	We Swear to Turn Our Hearts' Blood into a Song of Global Happiness
	Soldiers of a Certain Unit Lin Huanqing Gao Wensheng

	The Chinese Khrushchev peddles his "philosophy of survival" everywhere, falsely claiming that "those who say they are not afraid of death may not necessarily be steadfast when the time comes." The Chinese Khrushchev's fallacious theory that everyone is afraid of death is a malicious slander against revolutionary soldiers.

	Mao Zedong's revolutionary soldiers are fearless heroes. Only the Chinese Khrushchev is a coward who fears death and clings to life.

	Mao Zedong's revolutionary soldiers are the bravest and most fearless. We dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. We dare to fight tough battles and engage in fierce combat. We are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao. We have great loyalty to Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought nurtures us with great courage. We fully understand: without the sacrifice of a few, how can the majority be liberated? Without paying the necessary price, how can we eliminate all harmful elements? Chairman Mao said: "Chinese Communists, who take as their starting point the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people, believe that their cause is completely just, and are ready to sacrifice their personal interests and even their lives at any time to dedicate themselves to our cause." Chairman Mao's words are the highest guideline for the actions of revolutionary soldiers. We are determined to fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and dedicate ourselves to it in death. For the thorough victory of the Chinese revolution and the complete liberation of all humanity, we are willing to endure all hardships and shed all our blood. We swear to turn the blood of our heroic hearts into a song of global happiness.

    誓将满腔英雄血谱成全球幸福歌

    中国赫鲁晓夫到处贩卖“活命哲学”，胡说什么“那种嘴里说不怕死的人，到时候并不一定坚定。”中国赫鲁晓夫这套人人怕死的谬论，是对革命战士的恶毒污蔑。
    毛主席的革命战士是视死如归的硬骨头，只有中国赫鲁晓夫才是贪生怕死的胆小鬼。
    毛主席的革命战士最勇敢，最不怕死。我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，硬仗敢打，恶仗敢拚。我们无限忠于毛主席，绝对忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席。我们对毛主席有大忠，毛泽东思想哺育我们有大勇。我们完全懂得：没有少数人的牺牲，怎么能有多数人的解放？不付出必要的代价，怎么能扫除一切害人虫？毛主席说：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业”。毛主席的话是我们革命战士行动的最高准则。我们决心生为毛主席的革命路线战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线献身。为了中国革命的彻底胜利，为了全人类的彻底解放，我们甘愿把苦吃尽，把血流干。誓将满腔英雄血，谱成全球幸福歌。
