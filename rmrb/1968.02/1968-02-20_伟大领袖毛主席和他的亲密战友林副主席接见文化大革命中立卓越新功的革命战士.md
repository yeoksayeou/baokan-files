Our hearts' red sun, Chairman Mao, radiant and vigorous, took vigorous steps onto the stage, warmly and for a long time applauded the revolutionary warriors in the audience, and frequently waved and greeted them. More than 20,000 revolutionary warriors repeatedly shouted enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

New China News Agency, February 19th: Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, along with Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan, today received representatives from the Beijing Garrison Command of the People's Liberation Army and units stationed in Beijing to carry out the "three supports, two military" tasks, as well as the officers and soldiers of the 8341 Unit.

The sun rises, the sky turns red. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, radiant and vigorous, together with Vice Chairman Lin and other central leaders, happily came to the Great Hall of the People to visit the revolutionary warriors who have made outstanding contributions in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Long live Chairman Mao!" "Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" In the midst of the enthusiastic cheers of all the revolutionary warriors, our hearts' red sun Chairman Mao took vigorous steps onto the stage of the Great Hall of the People. Chairman Mao warmly and for a long time applauded everyone and, walking from one end of the stage to the other, frequently waved and greeted them.

The revolutionary warriors' hearts are with the Party, and every red heart is with the sun. At this most happy moment, more than 20,000 revolutionary warriors, facing Chairman Mao, continuously waved the brilliant red revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and repeatedly shouted enthusiastically: "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao!" "Forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought!" "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The revolutionary warriors have so many words surging in their hearts to tell you, and all words can be summed up in one sentence: "Sailing the seas depends on the helmsman, making revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought." The People's Liberation Army, following your great teachings, has achieved all victories in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "three supports, two military" work, which are all great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and all victories are attributed to the great supreme commander Chairman Mao.

The reception ended, but the revolutionary warriors were still immersed in immense excitement and boundless happiness. They sang loudly "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao," and "Wish Chairman Mao Eternal Life." The revolutionary warriors said that Chairman Mao receiving us in the increasingly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest spur for us and all military and civilian personnel across the country. They expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implement and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and strive forward to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
