The People's Air Force is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao. With Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in the Air Force are actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and are unlimitedly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. The "Heroic Aviation Regiment" that has repeatedly achieved victories in aerial combat solemnly vows: We are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will study and apply the latest directives, and strive to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao means regarding the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought as the first necessity of life. With Mao Zedong Thought, one fears neither fire nor water, and remains steadfast even if the earth shatters and the heavens fall. The selfless and fearless communist warrior Yang Ziyun (left) and Liu Yucun, who formed a "Red Pair" with him, study the "Three Articles" together, further advancing the revolutionization of their thinking.

Being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao means being closest to the revolutionary masses. The support-leftist troops of a certain unit of the Air Force stationed in the Tianjin Hongwei District always prioritize the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in their support-leftist work. They constantly extol the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao, praise the great achievements of Chairman Mao, and are always loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao means fighting wherever Chairman Mao points. The "Heroic Cannon Platoon 4" of the Air Force Unit 3515 is a collective that has been awarded 14 collective merits. They follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, shooting down enemy planes with their cannons and fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghui.

Being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao means passing down the invincible Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation. The model soldier Wang Yuchang (front left) regards helping soldiers to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought as the essence of loving soldiers, and considers cultivating soldiers' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao as his sacred duty.

Being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Feng Fusheng, who attended the Second Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works in the Air Force, and his comrades discuss their experiences in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao means forever reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's directives. The revolutionary cadres of the Air Force's direct-affiliated organs carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the latest directives, implementing them resolutely, checking repeatedly, and ensuring their implementation.

Being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao means actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, achieving new levels in study and application. Those praised as the "Good Four Stations on Mount Kunlun" follow Chairman Mao closely, determined to spend their lives reading Chairman Mao's books and becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

    人民空军无限忠于毛主席
    ——空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会胜利召开
    无限忠于毛主席，就有无穷的战斗力。空军广大指战员以林副主席为光辉榜样，活学活用毛泽东思想，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席。空中歼敌屡建战功的“航空兵英雄中队”庄严宣誓：无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，学好用好最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
   无限忠于毛主席，把活学活用毛泽东思想作为生活的第一需要。有了毛泽东思想，赴汤蹈火无所惧，天崩地裂志不移。无私无畏的共产主义战士杨梓云（左）与同他结成“一对红”的刘玉民，共同学习“老三篇”，进一步搞好思想革命化。
   无限忠于毛主席，才能对革命派最亲。空军某部驻天津红卫区支左部队，始终把宣传毛泽东思想放在支左工作的首位，时时大讲毛主席的光辉思想，事事大颂毛主席的丰功伟绩，处处忠于伟大领袖毛主席。
   无限忠于毛主席，毛主席指向哪里就战斗到哪里。空军三五一五部队“英雄炮四班”是荣立十四次集体战功的光荣集体。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，上炮猛打敌机，下炮狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿。
   无限忠于毛主席，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想一代一代传下去。爱兵模范王裕昌（前左），把帮助战士活学活用毛泽东思想当作爱兵的根本，把培养战士对毛主席的无限忠诚作为自己的崇高职责。
   无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。出席空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的丰福生同志（左）和战友们在一起交谈活学活用毛主席著作的体会。
   无限忠于毛主席，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。空军直属机关无产阶级革命派，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命学风，对毛主席著作和最新指示，学了就用，坚决照办，反复检查，不断落实。
   无限忠于毛主席，活学活用毛泽东思想，学出新水平，用出新水平。被誉为“昆仑山上好四站”的同志们，紧跟毛主席寸步不离，决心一辈子读毛主席的书，做毛主席的好战士。
