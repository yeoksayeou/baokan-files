	Everyone Should Return to Their Posts on Time

	In our unit, several comrades returned to their hometowns to visit relatives during the Spring Festival, and they have now returned to their posts one after another, eagerly engaging in the new struggle. However, a few individuals have not returned on time, and some even ridicule those who return to work on time, calling them “too stubborn” and “too honest,” even saying, “What’s the harm in staying a few more days?”

	I believe that once the holiday is over, one should return to their post on time. This aligns with Chairman Mao’s teaching of “grasp revolution, promote production.” The idea of “staying a few more days doesn’t matter” disregards the collective and national interests and is a manifestation of individualism. If those who went home to visit relatives do not return to their posts on time, it will affect national construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every revolutionary comrade should voluntarily observe socialist labor discipline and not arbitrarily violate it, nor should they find various excuses to justify their wrongdoings.

### 应该按时回工作岗位

    应该按时回工作岗位
    我们单位有几个同志春节期间回乡探亲，现在已陆续回到工作岗位，紧张地投入新的战斗。可是，个别人没有按时回来，还有人讥笑那些按时回来上班的人“太死心眼了”、“太老实了”，甚至说“多住几天有什么关系？”
    我认为，假期满了，就应该按时回工作岗位，这才符合毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的教导。所谓“多住几天没关系”，是不顾集体和国家利益，是个人主义在作怪。如果回去探亲的都不按时回到工作岗位，国家建设就会受到损失，无产阶级文化大革命就会受到影响。每个革命同志都应该自觉地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，而不能随意破坏它，更不应该找种种借口来为自己的错误行为辩护。
