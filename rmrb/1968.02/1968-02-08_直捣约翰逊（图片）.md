The U.S. imperialists, in their desperate attempt to prolong the Vietnam War, have escalated their aggression against Vietnam. They have intensified their bombing of North Vietnam, expanded their war of invasion into South Vietnam, and increased their military intervention in Laos and Cambodia. All these actions have aroused the strong indignation of the people of the world.

The U.S. imperialists have also intensified their political and economic pressure on the people of the world. They have imposed economic sanctions on Cuba, supported the reactionary regimes in Latin America, and intervened in the internal affairs of other countries. All these actions have further exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.

The people of the world have never been so united in their struggle against U.S. imperialism. The people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are fighting bravely against the U.S. aggressors. The people of Latin America are rising up against the reactionary regimes supported by the U.S. The people of the world are supporting the just struggle of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

The U.S. imperialists, led by Johnson, are the common enemy of the people of the world. We must unite and fight against them. We must support the just struggle of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. We must expose the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. We must struggle for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. We must struggle for the independence and freedom of all oppressed nations and peoples.

The people of the world have the power to defeat U.S. imperialism. We must unite and fight against them. We must support the just struggle of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. We must expose the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. We must struggle for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. We must struggle for the independence and freedom of all oppressed nations and peoples.
