The People's Revolutionary Committee of the Thừa Thiên–Huế region was established on the 14th. This committee will lead the people of this region to be ready to defeat any enemy counterattacks and mobilize the people to actively participate in the anti-American, save-the-nation struggle.

Recently, the National Liberation Front of Huế City held an emergency meeting attended by representatives of various revolutionary forces, political and religious groups, and representatives of the uprising committees of three districts in Huế City and six rural counties. The meeting analyzed the situation and made several decisions to adapt to the needs of the national situation.

The meeting issued a declaration stating that for the past thirteen years, the puppet government in the South and the puppet government in the Thừa Thiên–Huế region have been tools of American imperialism's new colonialist policy, acting as traitors and oppressors of our people. They do not represent the people; on the contrary, they are the enemies of the people.

The declaration said that on January 31, 1968, to ensure the survival of the nation and for their own fate, the people of the Thừa Thiên–Huế region, in coordination with the rest of the nation, took up arms to smash the puppet government from the provincial to the village level, liberating all rural areas and cities. The enemy suffered heavy losses. Some leaders of the puppet government have surrendered to the people, while others have been arrested and imprisoned by revolutionary forces. Except for a few places and a few outposts that have not yet been cleared, the puppet government has basically collapsed. County, commune, and ward people's revolutionary committees or uprising committees have been established, performing the tasks of leading the uprising and exercising administrative power.

Facing this situation, the conference decided to establish a temporary government for the Thừa Thiên–Huế region to represent the will and interests of the people and to realize the people's right to self-governance.

The declaration said that the tasks of the Thừa Thiên–Huế People's Revolutionary Committee are: to strengthen the great unity of the people, promote armed struggle, political struggle, and military work, firmly maintain and expand the people's right to self-governance, protect the people's lives and property, suppress the remnants of the reactionary elements who attempt to restore the American puppet regime, lead the people to be ready to defeat any enemy counterattacks; actively lead the people in production and implement thrift, while building health, cultural, and educational undertakings, and care for the people's material and spiritual lives; on the basis of strengthening the people's power, actively mobilize the people to enthusiastically provide manpower, materials, and participate in all work to serve the resistance, and thoroughly implement the slogan "Everything for the front, everything for victory."

The declaration concluded by announcing the election of the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Standing Committee of the Thừa Thiên–Huế People's Revolutionary Committee.

    领导人民随时准备挫败敌人反扑　动员人民更积极参加抗美救国斗争
    承天—顺化地区成立人民革命委员会
    广大人民奋起拿起武器粉碎伪政权，解放全部农村和城市
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方承天—顺化地区人民革命委员会十四日宣告成立。这个委员会将领导这个地区的人民随时准备挫败敌人的一切反扑，动员人民更积极地参加抗美救国斗争。
    顺化市民族民主与和平联盟阵线最近召开了由各种革命力量、各政治和宗教团体的代表，以及顺化市三个区和农村六个县的起义委员会代表参加的一次救国紧急会议，分析了形势，作出了一些决定，以适应国家形势的需要。
    会议发表了一项宣言指出，十三年来，南方伪政权和承天—顺化地区伪政权，是美帝国主义新殖民主义政策的统治工具，是镇压和剥削我们同胞的卖国走狗政权，它不仅不代表人民，恰恰相反，正是人民的敌人。
    宣言说，一九六八年一月三十一日，为了祖国的生存，为了自己本身的命运，承天—顺化地区人民在全国同胞配合下，拿起武器奋起粉碎从省到乡、村的伪政权机构，解放全部农村和城市。敌人遭到了惨重的失败。伪政权的一些头目或者已经向人民投降，或者已经被革命力量逮捕和监禁。除了几个地方和少数据点、哨所还没有被清除之外，伪政权基本上已经瓦解。县、乡、街区人民革命委员会或起义委员会已经成立，一方面执行领导起义的任务，一方面执行政权的任务。
    面对这种情况，大会决定成立承天—顺化地区临时政权，作为代表人民的意志和利益，实现人民当家作主权利的机构。
    宣言说，承天—顺化地区人民革命委员会的任务是：大力增强人民大团结，促进武装斗争、政治斗争和兵运工作，坚决保持和扩大人民当家作主的权利，保卫人民的生命财产，镇压企图重新恢复美国走狗制度的残余反动分子，领导人民随时准备挫败敌人的一切反扑；积极领导人民生产和实行节约，同时建设卫生、文化和教育事业，关心人民的物质和精神生活；在增强人民力量的基础上，积极动员人民踊跃提供人力、物力和参加为抗战服务的一切工作，彻底实现“一切为了前线，一切为了夺取胜利”的口号。
    宣言最后说，大会选出了承天—顺化地区人民革命委员会常务委员会的主席、副主席以及委员。
