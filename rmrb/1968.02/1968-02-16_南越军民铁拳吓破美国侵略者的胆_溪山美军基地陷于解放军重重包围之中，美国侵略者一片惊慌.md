The heroic armed forces of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien Liberation Zone in South Vietnam, who have been fighting in the area south of the demilitarized zone, after capturing the important outpost of Vinh Loc outside the Khe Sanh U.S. base and breaking through the enemy's defenses along Route 9, have recently launched a series of attacks on the Khe Sanh base, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The large number of U.S. troops trapped in this isolated base are now in dire straits.

On February 8, 9, and 10, the liberation forces continuously shelled the airstrip inside the Khe Sanh base and attacked the forward positions, clearing out the surrounding defensive outposts. On the 10th, under the fierce bombardment of the liberation forces, the only airstrip in the Khe Sanh base was severely damaged and declared closed. Thus, the Khe Sanh U.S. base, which had already been cut off from land transportation by the liberation forces, also lost its air supply, becoming a helpless island.

Khe Sanh is located in the northwestern part of Quang Tri Province, near the Vietnam-Laos border, about 20 kilometers south of the demilitarized zone. To hold onto this strategic location, the U.S. invaders have deployed several thousand U.S. Marines in the area, and recently, they have sent additional troops there.

On February 5, the liberation forces launched a sudden attack on Khe Sanh with concentrated artillery fire. Brave liberation fighters, under the cover of artillery, quickly broke through the enemy's defensive line on Hill 861, the outer perimeter of the base, striking fear and chaos into the enemy ranks.

This swift attack terrified the ruling clique in the White House. Johnson hurriedly ordered the Joint Chiefs of Staff to hold an emergency meeting to review the "defense plan" for Khe Sanh and demanded that each member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provide a written "guarantee" that Khe Sanh "can and should be held." The "guarantee" given by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff to Johnson was barely dry when, on February 7, the people's liberation forces, with lightning speed, captured Vinh Loc, knocking out a crucial barrier on the western side of the Khe Sanh base.

The U.S. invaders had previously boasted that they "could defend Vinh Loc well," but Vinh Loc was quickly captured by the liberation forces, delivering a heavy blow to the Americans. Thus, the U.S. invaders had to admit that "the loss of Vinh Loc is a bitter pill to swallow" and "a deeply disappointing event." The capture of Vinh Loc made Khe Sanh even more exposed to the liberation forces, placing the enemy in the Khe Sanh area in an even greater crisis.

The people's liberation forces continued their relentless shelling, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy holed up in Khe Sanh. They huddled in their trenches, too frightened to step out, constantly worried that shells would fall on their heads. According to a U.S. reporter who witnessed this scene, under the continuous and fierce shelling by the liberation forces, the U.S. troops in the Khe Sanh base were often in a state of chaos and fear. They were always on edge, ready to flee at any moment.

    南越军民铁拳吓破美国侵略者的胆
    溪山美军基地陷于解放军重重包围之中，美国侵略者一片惊慌
    新华社河内电　转战在非军事区以南战场上的英雄越南南方广治—承天解放武装力量，在七日攻占溪山美军基地外围重要据点卫村、突破敌人九号公路防线之后，最近几天，又连续对溪山基地发动一系列的袭击，使敌军遭到严重损失。被重重围困在这个孤立基地里的大批美军陷入了绝境。
    二月八日、九日和十日，解放武装力量不断炮轰溪山基地内的机场，袭击前沿阵地，清扫周围的防御据点。十日，在解放武装力量猛烈的炮击下，溪山基地内唯一的机场遭到严重破坏，被宣布关闭。这样，早已被解放武装力量切断陆路交通的溪山美军基地，空运接济至此也告断绝，成了一个无援的孤岛。
    溪山位于广治省西北靠近越南老挝边界的地方，在非军事区以南约二十多公里。美国侵略者为了守住这个战略要地，在这一带投入了美国海军陆战队好几千人，最近，又向那里增派大量美军。
    二月五日，解放武装力量以密集的炮火，向溪山发动突然袭击，英勇的解放武装力量战士，在炮火的掩护下，迅速地突破基地的外围屏障八六一高地的敌军防线，打得敌人惊慌失措，乱作一团。
    这次神速的攻击，使白宫的美国统治集团吓破了胆。约翰逊急忙命令参谋长联席会议召开紧急会议研究溪山的“防御计划”是否保险，并且要参谋长联席会议的每一个成员提出书面“保证”，肯定溪山是“能够而且应当”保住的。美国参谋长联席会议向约翰逊具结立下的“保证”墨迹未干，二月七日，人民解放武装力量以迅雷不及掩耳之势，一举攻占了卫村，打掉了溪山美军基地西面的重要屏障。
    美国侵略者事前大肆吹嘘他们“能够守卫好卫村”，但是，卫村很快地被解放武装力量攻占了，这给了美国侵略者当头沉重的一棒。于是，美国侵略者不得不承认，“卫村失守是一颗难咽的苦药丸”，“是一件令人大失所望的事”。卫村被攻占，使溪山更加清楚地暴露在解放武装力量的面前，使溪山地区的敌人面临更大危机。
    人民解放武装力量接连不断地炮击，打得困守溪山的敌人胆战心惊，坐立不安。他们龟缩在战壕里不敢走出来一步，日夜耽心炮弹落到他们的头上。据曾经目睹这种狼狈相的一个美国记者透露，在解放武装力量不断猛烈炮轰下，溪山基地里的美国少爷兵经常处于一片混乱恐惧的状态。他们平时神色总是十分慌张，随时准备逃命。
