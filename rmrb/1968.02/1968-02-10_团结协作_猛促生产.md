	Unity and Cooperation to Boost Production
	Mastering the Laws of Production

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Everyone knows that if you don't understand the situation of a matter, its nature, and its relationship with things outside of it, you won't know the laws of that matter, won't know how to do it, and won't be able to do that matter well.

	Class B Comrade: In the summer, the weather changes a lot, and it's hard to control the temperature and humidity. Sometimes the car is easy to drive, sometimes it's not. We must be patient and never be impatient, especially pay attention to product quality. We should follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and find the patterns in our work, making our work more, faster, better, and more economical. As long as we arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, there is no difficulty we cannot overcome, no problem we cannot solve, even if the sky falls, we are not afraid.

	Be Humble in the Face of Achievements

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Even if our work has achieved extremely great success, there is no reason to be proud and arrogant. Humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind. We should always remember this truth.

	Class C Comrade: I came to work today and heard that the number of defects has decreased. I saw the shift handover book, and Sister Qiao also reported this good news. I am even happier. Although this is the result of everyone's efforts, the main reason is the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the face of achievements, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great success, there is no reason to be proud and arrogant. Humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind. We should always remember this truth." Today, I used Chairman Mao's teachings to guide my work. No problems were found in the work. I hope you will carefully check it.

	Practice Self-Criticism

	Chairman Mao teaches us: We all come from the four corners of the country, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. ... Our cadres must care for every soldier, and everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other.

	I and Zhang Xiulan had a rift in production, causing a lack of unity, and we haven't spoken to each other for several months, directly affecting production. Through the recent few days of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and fighting against our "selfishness," I felt that it was wrong, using Chairman Mao's thoughts to reflect on myself, asking myself: "Shutai, Shutai! Is what you are doing right? Should you continue like this, or should you listen to Chairman Mao's words?" I repeatedly used Chairman Mao's thoughts to reflect on myself, thinking that I should correct it immediately, so today I took the initiative to find Zhang Xiulan to exchange views during lunch.

	Think of Others First in Every Matter

	Chairman Mao teaches us: What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. That is what a good comrade does.

	Originally, I was in charge of the two machines at the south end, but I thought Comrade X's health was not good, and it was a bit hard to handle three machines, so the next day I requested to switch machine numbers with X. But after working for a day, I felt tired, and at that moment, "selfishness" was spinning in my mind. I opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and saw Chairman Mao criticizing some people: "When faced with a matter, first think of yourself, then think of others." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." Through study, my thoughts have greatly improved. I should take on heavier responsibilities. The next day, I felt especially happy when I took over the shift, and I didn't feel tired when I worked. The power of Chairman Mao's thoughts is great.

	Work Together with Comrades Who Have Different Opinions

	Chairman Mao teaches us: We all come from the four corners of the country, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. ... Everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other.

	Class A Comrade: I am very happy to see you come to work. This is your practical action in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Yesterday, I wanted to talk to you, but because of "selfishness," I thought we had different viewpoints, and I was afraid it would hurt feelings, so I didn't dare to say it. After going home, I studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said: "The spirit of Dr. Norman Bethune, who was completely selfless and dedicated to others, is shown in his extreme responsibility to his work, and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." Through study, I overcame the "selfishness" that stopped me from talking to you. ... We must carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. Let us unite and fight the enemy together.

### 团结协作  猛促生产

专栏：

     团结协作  猛促生产
      掌握生产规律
    毛主席教导我们：大家明白，不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。
    乙班同志：夏季里天气变化比较大，温湿度不好掌握，车有时好开，有时就不好开，我们一定要耐心，千万不要急躁，特别要注意产品质量。我们要象伟大领袖毛主席教导的那样，在工作中摸规律，把我们的工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。只要我们用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，没有克服不了的困难，没有解决不了的难题，就是天塌下来也不怕。
                                  甲班　乔桂荣
                          一九六七年七月八日
      成绩面前要虚心
    毛主席教导我们：即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。
    丙班同志：今天上班来听说次布下降了，看了交班本，乔大姐也交的是这件大喜事，我心里更是高兴，虽然说这是大家的努力，但主要的还是有战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引。在成绩面前，我们还要牢记毛主席的教导：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”今天，我就是用毛主席这一教导指导我的工作的。工作没发现什么问题，希望你认真做好检查吧。
                                  乙班　刘荣珍
                            一九六七年十月四日
      多做自我批评
    毛主席教导我们：我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。
    我和张秀兰就因为在生产上产生了隔阂，造成了不团结，我们已有好几个月不说话了，直接影响了生产。通过最近几天来活学活用毛主席著作和斗自己的
  “私”字，觉得很不应该，用毛主席的思想来对照，就问自己：“淑台呀！淑台！你这样做对吗？还是这样继续下去呢，还是听毛主席的话？”我反复用毛主席的思想对照自己，认为应该马上改正才对，所以就在今天我利用吃饭时间主动地找张秀兰交换了意见。
                                    丙班　苍淑台
                        一九六七年十一月十八日
      一事当前要先替别人打算
    毛主席教导我们：什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。
    原来我是看南头两台车的，可是我想××同志身体不好，看三台有点吃力，第二天就要求和××换换车号。可是看了一天我觉得累，这时“私”字在我脑子里打转转，我翻开《毛主席语录》，毛主席批评有的人“一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算”。毛主席教导我们：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”通过学习，我思想有很大的提高，应该挑重担子，第二天接班觉得特别痛快，干起活来不觉累，毛主席的思想威力就是大。
                                丙班　尉秀芳
                      一九六七年十一月二十四日
      要团结和自己意见不同的
            同志一道工作
    毛主席教导我们：我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。
    甲班同志：看到你上班来了，我非常高兴，这是你响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的实际行动。昨天我就想和你谈谈，因为“私”字在作怪，想到咱们是两个观点的，怕谈出来伤了感情，也就不敢说了。回家后我又学习了毛主席著作，毛主席他老人家说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”通过学习，才打倒了阻止我去同你谈谈的“私”字。……我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让我们团结起来共同对敌。
                                  丙班　刘俊娟
                        一九六七年十一月十八日
