Your victory once again proves that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated.

Mao Zedong

Over ten days, more than ten thousand enemy troops were annihilated, and the enemy's command system was paralyzed as the liberation forces launched fierce attacks on the headquarters of the American puppet regime.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 14th, the people's liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Cholon region of South Vietnam launched a surprise attack on the den of the American puppet group—Saigon—during the Spring Festival. They fought side by side with the people of Saigon and ignited a revolutionary storm in the enemy's nest, achieving extremely great victories both militarily and politically.

According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the command department of the people's liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Cholon region issued a report on the 10th, detailing the magnificent achievements made by the military and people of the region in the first ten days of the new year. Preliminary statistics show that after ten days of continuous fighting, the military and people of the Saigon-Cholon region killed, wounded, and captured more than ten thousand enemy troops, including three thousand American soldiers, and completely annihilated five enemy battalions.

The report said that the people's liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Cholon region, in close coordination with other battlefields in the south, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's den on the night of January 30th and the early morning of the 31st. Tens of millions of people in the Saigon-Cholon region rose up, destroying the enemy's ruling institutions. From the start of the battle, the military and people of the Saigon-Cholon region launched a fierce assault on a series of military and political headquarters and the most important military bases of the American puppet group.

In the following days, the people of Saigon continued to advance, continuously attacking the enemy's paratroopers, marines, pseudo-commando units, and pseudo-police, annihilating a large number of enemy forces. Up to now, the people's liberation armed forces, together with the people and patriotic forces who have risen up to fight, have controlled densely populated areas, nearly half of the city's fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and fourth districts, and are continuously attacking the first, second, and third districts. The military and people in the suburbs and surrounding areas have also continuously attacked the enemy, fiercely assaulting the American bases in Bien Hoa, Lai Thieu, Dong Na, and O Mon, as well as the American Second Field Army Command, the puppet Third Army Command, and the puppet Twenty-Fifth Division Command. At the same time, they launched attacks in all county towns, controlling almost all the rural areas of the towns of Cu Chi, Bien Cat, Duc Hoa, Go Cong, and Tan An, and forcing the enemy to withdraw from dozens of military outposts and sentry posts around the city. This series of extensive and fierce attacks strongly supported and assisted the fighting of the military and people in the Saigon urban area.

The military and people of the Saigon-Cholon region have also cut off all transportation lines leading to Saigon, causing the enemy to face many difficulties in mutual support and logistics supply. They have continuously attacked the enemy and repelled the enemy's elite forces sent to rescue the besieged enemy, annihilating the enemy battalion by battalion. From the American infantry and armored units to the pseudo-marines and paratroopers, all were beaten into a state of disarray.

The report said that the military and people of the Saigon-Cholon region have achieved a very great and comprehensive victory: they have annihilated a large number of the enemy's combat forces; they have directly attacked the political and military headquarters of the American puppet group, causing the entire military command system and administrative system of the enemy in Saigon and the entire south to fall into a state of paralysis and chaos. The enemy's ruling institutions in the cities, provincial capitals, towns, and rural areas of the Saigon-Cholon region have been destroyed in large areas. The military and people of the Saigon-Cholon region have also destroyed many of the enemy's weapons of war, including shooting down and destroying nearly 200 aircraft and destroying more than 600 military vehicles.

The report said that the people's liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Cholon region have made a leap forward. The liberated areas have expanded to the outskirts of the city and to the vicinity of the Saigon-Cholon region. Thousands of young people are enthusiastic about joining the liberation army to kill the enemy and save the country. In the newly liberated cities and rural areas, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and other laborers, students have joined the self-defense corps, militia, and guerrilla units, using weapons seized from the enemy and everything in their hands to fight the enemy day and night, protect the people, and protect the revolutionary achievements.

The National and Peace Forces Alliance was born in Saigon, making the anti-American, pro-national salvation forces even stronger.

Tens of thousands of pseudo-soldiers and police, and pseudo-government officials have defected from the enemy's ranks, joining the people, making the American bandits increasingly isolated.

The report pointed out that the victory of the military and people of the Saigon-Cholon region in the first ten days of the new year has great significance both militarily and politically. The liberated areas have expanded to the vicinity of Saigon. The war has broken out in the den of the invaders and traitors. Our military and people's all-around offensive have tied down most of the pseudo-army's total reserves and part of the American mobile forces. The victory of the military and people of the Saigon-Cholon region has made an active contribution to the great common victory of the people of the entire south, laying a very solid foundation for achieving a complete victory, and creating a particularly favorable situation.

The report warmly commended the brave and outstanding fighting spirit and glorious achievements of all cadres and soldiers of the main forces, local forces, self-defense corps, militia, and guerrilla units; it warmly hailed the people of the Saigon-Cholon region for their high patriotic spirit and deep hatred for the enemy, rising up to fight side by side with the people's liberation armed forces to kill the enemy and achieve merit.

The report pointed out that the American bandits and the traitorous group of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, who are in a desperate situation, are struggling desperately like a wounded beast. In the future, they will stubbornly play many unscrupulous tricks. Therefore, the war will still be arduous and fierce. However, the enemy's desperate struggles will absolutely not intimidate the heroic victors.

The report called on the military and people of the Saigon-Cholon region to advance victoriously, continuously attack the enemy, and resolutely thwart all enemy reinforcements, annihilate and disintegrate more American puppet military forces, quickly consolidate and develop their own strength from all aspects, maintain and expand the victories already achieved, and strive for a complete victory.

    新春战斗取得辉煌战果
    你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。
    毛泽东
    十天歼敌一万多，猛攻美伪首脑机关，敌人指挥系统陷于瘫痪
    据新华社河内十四日电　越南南方西贡—嘉定地区人民解放武装力量春节以来出奇兵直捣美伪集团老巢——西贡。他们同西贡广大人民并肩战斗，在敌人巢穴里掀起革命新风暴，在军事上和政治上取得了极其伟大的胜利。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，西贡—嘉定地区人民解放武装力量指挥部十日发表了西贡—嘉定地区军民今年初春十天所取得的无比辉煌的战果的公报。据初步统计，西贡—嘉定地区军民经过十天连续奋战，打死、打伤和俘虏敌人一万多名，其中包括美军三千名，全歼敌军五个营。
    公报说，西贡—嘉定地区人民解放武装力量同全南方其他战场紧密配合，在一月三十日夜间和三十一日凌晨，猛攻敌人的巢穴。数以百万计的西贡—嘉定地区人民也揭竿而起，摧毁敌人的统治机构。战斗一开始，西贡—嘉定地区军民就猛烈进攻敌人的一系列军政首脑机构和美伪集团头等重要的军事基地。
    在以后的几天里，西贡市军民乘胜前进，连续袭击敌军伞兵部队、海军陆战队、伪别动队和伪警察，歼灭敌人的大量有生力量。直到现在，人民解放武装力量同奋起斗争的人民和爱国力量控制了居民稠密的、占城市面积近一半的第五、六、七、八区和第四区，同时不断向第一、二、三区发动进攻。郊区和附近地区的军民也连续地进攻敌人，猛烈袭击边和、莱溪、东如、油汀美军基地以及美军第二野战司令部、伪军第三军司令部和伪军第二十五师司令部。同时，在所有县城里发动进攻，控制了古芝、边葛、德和、守德、新渊等市镇和郊区的几乎全部农村，攻克和迫使敌人撤出城市周围的成十座敌军据点和哨所。这一系列广泛而猛烈的进攻，有力地配合和支援了西贡市区军民的战斗。
    西贡—嘉定地区军民还切断了通往西贡的所有交通线，使敌人在互相支援和后勤供应方面遇到许多困难。他们还连续地进攻敌人并打退前来支援被困敌人的敌军精锐部队，把敌人整营整营地消灭，从美军的步兵、装甲部队到伪海军陆战队和伞兵部队，都被打得焦头烂额。
    公报说，西贡—嘉定地区军民已经取得了十分巨大和全面的胜利：消灭了敌人的大量有生力量；直捣美伪集团政治、军事首脑机关，使西贡和全南方的敌人整个军事指挥系统和行政系统陷于瘫痪、混乱状态。敌人在城市、省会、市镇和西贡—嘉定地区农村的统治机构被大片大片地摧毁。西贡—嘉定地区军民还摧毁了敌人许多战争工具，包括击落击毁飞机近二百架，击毁各种军车六百多辆。
    公报说，西贡—嘉定地区人民解放武装力量有了飞跃的成长。解放区扩大到城市的周围。扩大到西贡—堤岸地区附近。成千青年热血沸腾，踊跃参加解放军，杀敌救国。在刚得到解放的城市和农村里，广大工人、农民以及其他劳动者、学生参加了自卫队、民兵游击队，使用从敌人那里缴获来的武器和自己手中的一切武装，不分日夜地杀敌除奸，保卫人民，保卫革命成果。
    民族与和平力量联盟在西贡市诞生了，使抗美救国的队伍更加壮大。
    成万名伪军官兵和警察、伪政权人员脱离敌人队伍，投向人民，使美国强盗日益陷于孤立。
    公报指出，西贡—嘉定地区军民初春以来十天的胜利，在军事和政治上具有十分巨大的意义。解放区已经扩大到西贡附近。战争就在侵略和卖国头目的巢穴里爆发。我们军民的全面进攻，牵制伪军总后备力量的大部分和美国机动部队的一部分。西贡—嘉定地区军民的胜利，为全南方军民的共同的巨大胜利作出了积极的贡献，为夺取彻底的胜利打下了一个十分稳固的基础，打出了一个特别有利的局面。
    公报热烈表彰各个主力部队、地方部队、自卫队、民兵和游击队的全体干部和战士勇敢卓绝的战斗精神和建立的显赫战功；热烈欢呼西贡—堤岸地区人民以高度的爱国主义精神和对敌人的深刻仇恨，奋起斗争，同人民解放武装力量并肩一起杀敌立功。
    公报指出，陷于危困境地的美国强盗和阮文绍—阮高其越奸集团象一头受重伤的野兽一样，正在进行疯狂的挣扎，今后他们还会顽固地玩弄许多不可告人的阴谋。因此，战争还会艰巨和激烈。但是，敌人的疯狂挣扎，绝对吓不倒英雄的胜利者。
    公报号召西贡—嘉定地区军民乘胜前进，连续进攻敌人，顽强地挫败敌人一切增援，消灭和瓦解更多的美伪军有生力量，迅速从各个方面巩固和发展自己的力量，保持和扩大已经取得的胜利，进而夺取彻底的胜利。（附图片）
