How to do a good job in preparing for spring production this year? The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Gao Dian Brigade of Zhuzihe Commune, Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, have, after extensive study and discussion, unanimously agreed that the most important preparation is to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Through the establishment of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the brigade's preparation for spring production has taken on a lively and vigorous scene.

Initially, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this brigade had differing views on how to do a good job in preparing for spring production. A few thought that as long as material preparations were made, spring production could be ensured. The majority of the community members believed that the most important thing in preparing for spring production was to prepare ideologically and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide spring production. With the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the brigade's leadership group for promoting production while carrying forward the revolution organized community members to discuss this issue. The head of the Qutun East Production Team, Qu Riyang, said: "Last year, our production team, following Chairman Mao's instruction to 'grasp revolution, promote production,' mobilized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and the people's spiritual outlook underwent a great change, resulting in a good harvest. This year, we must more extensively and deeply study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve victory in spring production preparations. We must not be fooled by Chinese Khrushchev again, focusing only on material aspects and neglecting ideological work." The old poor peasant community member, Yu Yanxu, from the Wangtun West Production Team said: "Chairman Mao's latest instructions are in our hearts and are the guiding light for our actions. We must implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in our actions and follow Chairman Mao wholeheartedly in revolution." The militia member, Yu Baolan, said: "We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, timely expose the enemy's sabotage plots, and do a good job in spring production." The brigade and production teams have also held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres, old peasants, militia members, and women, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

After extensive study and discussion, the community members' and cadres' revolutionary enthusiasm grew stronger, and the preparations for spring production quickly got underway in a vigorous manner. Every morning, as soon as it was light, community members from various production teams would gather at the production team to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and then head to their respective workstations. Many production teams have restored and improved fertilizer organizations, launching activities to collect farmyard manure and find more fertilizer sources. Most of the farmyard manure that has been collected has been transported to the fields, and in addition, 20,000 piles of silt have been collected. Some production teams have also done a good job in seed selection and tool repair.

    用毛泽东思想统帅春季生产
    高店大队备耕工作出现了热气腾腾的大好局面
    本报讯　怎样搞好今年春耕生产的准备工作？辽宁省新金县占子河公社高店大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，经过大学习、大讨论，一致认为，千准备，万准备，切实落实毛主席的最新指示是最大的准备。他们通过大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，使备耕工作出现了热气腾腾的大好局面。
    这个大队的贫下中农和革命干部最初对怎样做好备耕工作认识上不一致。少数人认为，只要抓好物质方面的准备工作，就能搞好春耕生产。大多数社员认为，搞好春耕生产准备工作，最重要的是搞好思想上的准备，落实毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想统帅春耕生产。在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大队抓革命促生产领导班子组织社员对这个问题进行了讨论。曲屯东生产队队长曲日阳说：“去年，我们生产队根据毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的教导，发动广大贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作，人的精神面貌大改观，使农业生产获得了好收成。今年我们更要广泛深入地活学活用毛泽东思想，切实落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取备耕生产的胜利。咱决不能再上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，只抓物质，不抓思想。”王屯西生产队老贫农社员于延寿说：“毛主席的最新指示说在我们贫下中农的心坎上，是我们行动的指路明灯。我们一定要把毛主席的最新指示落实在行动上，一个心眼紧跟毛主席干革命。”基干民兵于宝兰说：“我们要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，及时识破阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，搞好春耕生产。”大队、生产队还分别举办了干部、老农、民兵、妇女等各种不同类型的毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示。
    经过大学习、大讨论，社员和干部的革命干劲越来越大，春耕准备工作很快轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。每天早晨天蒙蒙亮，各生产队的社员就来到生产队，学习毛主席的最新指示，接着就奔赴各自的劳动岗位。许多生产队恢复和健全了积肥组织，开展了大积农家肥、广找肥源的活动。已积攒的农家肥大部分送到了地里，另外还积了湾泥两万堆。有的生产队选种和修理小农具等，也做得比较好。
