The report from Beijing Railway Bureau's Xizhimen Station raises a very important question: Are the members of the revolutionary committees servants of the entire revolutionary people, or representatives of factional interests? This is a major issue concerning whether the revolutionary committees can be consolidated and whether power can be exercised properly.

The revolutionary committees were established during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, as temporary organs of proletarian dictatorship. They are neither mass organizations nor liaison offices for various factions. The members of these power organs are representatives of all revolutionary people in the region or unit, not representatives of factional interests. All members of the revolutionary committees are servants of the people. Their work must be "based on the interests of the people, not on the interests of individuals or small groups." If they are not doing this but instead acting as spokespeople for factional interests and seeking private gains for a faction, aren't they placing themselves in the position of bourgeois "representatives"?

The members of the revolutionary committees are exercising power for the proletariat, not for small groups or factions. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people. For Communist Party members, this means standing on the side of the Party, on the side of Party principles and Party policies." This means we must exercise power according to Party principles and never allow power to be exercised according to factional interests. Exercising power according to Party principles means exercising power with Mao Zedong Thought; exercising power according to factional interests means allowing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas to exercise power. This is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. All comrades in the revolutionary committees at various levels must uphold the proletarian Party principles and resolutely fight against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, rooting it out completely.

Regardless of which faction's revolutionary mass organization the original leaders came from, after joining the revolutionary committee, they must consciously realize the change in their position. It was wrong to have factionalism before, and it is even more wrong to bring factionalism into the revolutionary committee. We must consciously become genuine members of the revolutionary committee.

The broad revolutionary masses must also supervise the members of the revolutionary committees to resolutely overcome factionalism. The idea that "having someone inside makes it easier to be an official" and demanding that the representatives of one's original organization in the revolutionary committee pursue private interests for a faction is completely wrong. On the contrary, one must stand on the side of the proletariat and strictly supervise each member of the revolutionary committee, ensuring that they exercise power and use power according to the proletarian Party principles.

    按党性原则掌权
    本报评论员
    北京铁路局西直门车站的报道，提出了一个很重要的问题：革命委员会成员是做全体革命人民的勤务员，还是做派别利益的代表？这是关系到革命委员会能不能巩固，能不能掌好权、用好权的重大问题。
    革命委员会是在无产阶级文化大革命中，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下建立起来的无产阶级专政的临时权力机构。它既不是群众组织，更不是各派的联络站。参加这个权力机构的成员，是本地区、本单位全体革命人民的代表，而不是派别利益的代表。所有革命委员会的成员，都是人民的勤务员。他们的工作，必须是“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。如果不是这样，而是去做派别利益的代言人，去谋某个派别的私利，那岂不是把自己放到资产阶级“议员”的地位了吗？
    革命委员会成员是为无产阶级掌权，而不是为小团体、为派别掌权。伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”这就是说，我们要按党性原则掌权，而绝不允许凭派性掌权。按党性原则掌权，就是用毛泽东思想掌权；凭派性掌权，就是让资产阶级、小资产阶级思想掌权。这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。各级革命委员会的同志，都应该坚持无产阶级的党性原则，坚决地同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性作斗争，把它彻底根除。
    不管原来是哪一派革命群众组织的负责人，参加革命委员会以后，都要自觉地意识到自己地位的变化。原来闹派性就不对，现在带着派性到革命委员会就更加错误。我们一定要自觉地做一个名副其实的革命委员会的成员。
    广大革命群众，也要督促革命委员会的成员坚决克服派性。那种认为“朝里有人好做官”，要求原来本组织的代表在革命委员会中追求一派私利的想法，是完全错误的。相反地，要站在无产阶级的立场上，严格地监督每个革命委员会的成员，让他坚持按无产阶级党性原则掌好权，用好权。
