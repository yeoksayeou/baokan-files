According to a report from New China News Agency on the 18th, New Delhi: The second issue of the Indian revolutionary monthly journal "Liberation" published an article exposing the counter-revolutionary nature of the Indian Communist Party (Marxist) members who colluded with the Danji traitor group, acting as running dogs for the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, deceiving the people, and suppressing the revolutionary movement.

The article states: The Indian reactionary ruling class dissolved the so-called United Front government of West Bengal, which was formed by the Indian Communist Party (Marxist) members colluding with the Danji traitor group and other reactionary politicians, last November.

The article asks: Since the United Front government served the big landlords and big bourgeoisie like faithful dogs, why was it dissolved?

The article points out: The spark of Naxalbari ignited a fire that threatened to sweep across vast rural areas. A revolutionary tide is about to sweep the nation. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "It is like standing on the shore and watching the masts of a ship that has already appeared on the horizon; it is like standing on a high mountain and watching the sun rising in the east, radiating light and about to emerge; it is like a baby stirring in the womb, about to be born." As part of the bourgeois-landlord dictatorship, the United Front government established hundreds of police camps, camp courts, mobile courts, etc., to strangle this baby that is about to be born. Now, at the moment when the leaders of the Indian Communist Party (Revolutionary) are imprisoned, when hundreds of other revolutionaries are arrested or persecuted, and when organized violence is to be taken against the awakened peasants, if the United Front government continues to rule, the "Marxist" leaders (referring to the heads of the Indian Communist Party (Marxist)) will be exposed, and they will not be able to stir up trouble within the party and among the people. Therefore, they need to play another role.

The article exposes that the heads of the Indian Communist Party (Marxist), who claim to be "Marxists," are hypocrites. They deceive party members and the masses with revolutionary slogans, collude with the consistently anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people reactionary parties, manipulate fake elections, and praise bourgeois democracy.

The article further exposes that the Indian Communist Party (Marxist) members, in their so-called United Front government in West Bengal, implemented reactionary policies to serve the exploiting classes. The article states: On the food front, the United Front government, during its rule, revoked the order to requisition from landlords, allowing landlords and other black-market traders to reap unprecedented huge profits this year. All the grain purchased came from the poorest peasants, while not a single speculator or profiteer was touched. This is indeed a cruel class struggle. On the industrial front, the United Front government put forward the capitulationist slogans of "not increasing strikes and stoppages, but increasing production" and "labor-management truce," dissolving the workers' strike struggles, and even using reactionary decrees to arrest workers on a large scale. On the agricultural front, the United Front government advocated "giving landowners their due share," that is, continuing the most despicable form of feudal exploitation, and closely cooperating with the police to suppress the peasants' various resistances against the existing system. The article points out that the Indian Communist Party (Marxist) members are running dogs of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie disguised as "Marxists," and until the moment they lost power, they faithfully served their masters.

The article concludes: The situation in India is indeed excellent. The laboring people hate the Congress Party. The true faces of the so-called "socialist parties" and the Danji traitor group have been exposed. No matter how the Indian Communist Party (Marxist) members try, they will meet the same fate as other "socialists" and the Danji traitor group and will not have a good ending.

    印度《解放》月刊揭露印修在西孟加拉邦的反革命罪行
    印修忠实地为大地主大资产阶级效劳
    勾结丹吉叛徒集团欺骗人民镇压革命运动
    据新华社十八日讯  新德里消息：印度革命月刊《解放》第二期发表文章，揭露印共修正主义分子勾结丹吉叛徒集团，充当大地主、大资产阶级的走狗，欺骗人民，镇压革命运动的反革命面目。
    文章说：印度反动统治阶级去年十一月解散了印共修正主义分子勾结丹吉叛徒集团和其他反动政客组成的所谓西孟加拉邦联合阵线政府。
    文章问道：既然联合阵线政府象忠实的走狗一样为大地主和大资产阶级服务，那么它为什么会解散？
    文章指出：纳萨尔巴里点燃了有席卷大片乡村地区之势的火焰。一个革命的浪潮将要横扫全国。用毛泽东同志的话来说：“它是站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船，它是立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日，它是躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿。”作为资产阶级——地主专政机构的一部分，联合阵线政府设立了数百处警察营地、营地法庭、流动法庭，等等，来扼杀这个正要出生的婴儿。现在，当把印共革命派领导人投入监狱的时刻，当其他数以百计的革命者要被逮捕，或受迫害的时候，当要对觉醒了的农民采取有组织的暴力行动的时候，如果联合阵线政府还继续执政，“马克思主义”领袖们（按指印共修正主义头目）就会暴露无遗，他们就不能在党的队伍和人民中间兴风作浪了。因此，需要他们转而扮演别的角色。
    文章揭露说，自称“马克思主义者”的印共修正主义头目，是口是心非的。他们用革命的词句欺骗党员和群众，同一贯反共、反华、反人民的反动政党互相勾结，操纵伪选举，吹捧资产阶级的民主。
    文章接着揭露了印共修正主义分子在西孟加拉邦搞所谓联合阵线政府，推行为剥削阶级服务的反动政策。文章说：在粮食战线上，联合阵线政府在其当政期间，撤销了对地主征购的命令，听任地主和其他黑市商人在这一年中捞取他们前所未有的巨额利润。所有收购的粮食都是来自最贫苦的农民，而没有动囤积居奇者和投机商人一根毫毛。这的确是一场残酷的阶级斗争。在工业战线上，联合阵线政府提出“不是增加罢工和停工，而是增加生产”和实行“劳资休战”的投降主义口号，瓦解工人的罢工斗争，甚至引用反动法令大肆逮捕工人。在农业战线上，联合阵线政府主张“使土地拥有人得到应得的份额”，即把目前最可恶的封建剥削形式继续保持下去，并且同警察密切配合，镇压贫农对现行制度的种种反抗。文章指出，印共修正主义分子是披着“马克思主义”外衣的大地主和大资产阶级的走狗，直到他们掌权的最后一刻，都忠实地为他们的主子效劳。
    文章最后说：印度的形势确实大好。劳苦人民憎恨国大党。那些所谓的“社会主义政党”和丹吉叛徒集团的面目已经暴露。不管印共修正主义分子怎样想方设法，他们也象其他“社会主义者”和丹吉叛徒集团一样，决不会有好下场。
