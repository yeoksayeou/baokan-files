The Tianjin Silk Weaving Factory No. 9 launched a coal-saving campaign involving all employees, achieving excellent results. In just two months, the factory used only 75% of the coal allocated by the state, while consistently exceeding production targets and improving product quality.

Previously, the factory had been wasteful in its coal usage. Steam valves were left unattended, and workshop pipelines were opened indiscriminately, leading to high coal consumption. Some people argued that since the state has many large coal mines, extracting just a bit more coal would be enough for us. Through a thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev, the broad masses of workers came to realize that waste and conservation represent a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two ideologies. After the furnace was fired up in November last year, the factory leadership organized repeated study sessions on Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift and conservation, emphasizing the great significance of saving coal. This greatly heightened the sense of responsibility among the revolutionary workers to protect state resources.

With heightened awareness, the revolutionary workers spontaneously held "Zhuge Liang" meetings, where everyone contributed ideas, coming up with more than ten practical methods for saving coal. They immediately put these ideas into action, shortening pipeline distances, improving the unreasonable design of the "steam distribution bags," removing rust layers, and strengthening insulation to prevent heat loss. The boiler operators also took responsibility for opening and closing the steam valves, picking out unburned coal and returning it to the furnace for reburning. As a result, coal consumption was significantly reduced. The situation in this factory shows that production units have great potential for coal conservation.

### 生产单位节约用煤大有可为

    生产单位节约用煤大有可为
    天津市丝织九厂发动全厂职工开展节煤运动，收到了很好的效果。两个月的时间，只用了国家供应量百分之七十五的原煤，而生产计划月月超额完成，产品质量也有所提高。
    这个厂原来在生产用煤方面存在大手大脚的现象，蒸汽阀门无人管，车间管道随便开。因此，耗煤量很大。有的人说：国家有很多大煤矿，只要多采半分钟，就足够我们用的了。经过对中国赫鲁 晓夫的大批判，广大职工认识到浪费和节约是两个阶级、两条道路、两种思想的斗争。去年十一月份开炉后，厂里负责人就组织大家反复学习了毛主席关于勤俭节约的教导，大讲节煤的重大意义，大大提高了广大革命职工爱护国家物资的高度责任感。
    认识提高以后，广大革命职工又自动开“诸葛亮会”，人人献策，找出了十几条切实可行的节约用煤的路子。说干就干，大家一起动手，缩短了管道距离，改进了
  “分气包”不合理的装置，消除了水锈层，并加强了保温工作，防止热量的散失。司炉工还专门负责蒸汽阀门的开关，把烧不透的煤核拣出回炉复烧。这样一来，耗煤量比过去大大下降。这个厂的情况说明，生产单位的节煤工作是大有可为的。
