    Selected Articles from the Great Criticism Campaign by Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres of Beijing Knitting Factory Against the Counter-Revolutionary Economism of the Chinese Khrushchev
    Editor's Note: The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work."

    The counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the Chinese Khrushchev has been promoting in factories and enterprises is to oppose proletarian politics taking the lead and to implement bourgeois politics taking the lead, leading the factories and enterprises onto the capitalist path.

    Proletarian politics taking the lead means Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead. Implementing Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead, realizing the revolutionization of people's thinking, and the socialist labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and revolutionary cadres will be fully brought into play. The achievements made by Beijing Knitting Factory with the help of the comrades from the 8341 Unit prove this point.

    In factories and enterprises, insisting on proletarian politics taking the lead means, at present, mobilizing the broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres to insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, implementing and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, thoroughly criticizing the revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, overcoming bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist thinking, "grasp revolution, promote production," and turn the factory into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Production Must Be Led by Proletarian Politics
    Wang Ruiyao, Wang Minzhong

    The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that in all undertakings, we must insist on the principle of politics taking the lead. He also says: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The Chinese Khrushchev openly opposes Chairman Mao's great instructions and vigorously advocates "production taking the lead." He shouts: "The main task of our people and the Party is to develop productive forces as quickly as possible," "This is the task of all work." "Now all the work we are doing is how to develop productive forces as quickly as possible." Another major capitalist-roader within the Party even more blatantly follows suit: "What is a factory for? I think the task of a factory is first and foremost production."

    A small clique of capitalist-roaders within our factory actively promotes this revisionist line. They created the infamous "dry goods theory." A capitalist-roader within the Party in our factory raves: "No matter what you say, without 'dry goods' it's useless." They believe that proletarian politics, class struggle, are all useless "moisture"; only production and technology are the only useful "dry goods."

    The capitalist-roaders within the Party in our factory, following the Chinese Khrushchev and others, vigorously promote "production taking the lead." Are they really for socialist construction and for improving production? Absolutely not, and it is completely impossible.

    They shout about "focus on production," but in their hearts, they think about completing various production targets to earn more profits, to deceive the title of a "red flag factory," as personal capital to climb up. Under the guidance of this revisionist ideology, it is inevitable to distort the socialist direction of production, inevitably to engage in capitalist management, and inevitably to damage socialist production, leading the factory onto the capitalist track. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in our factory did not advocate studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, did not focus on the revolutionization of people's thinking, did not fundamentally mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, but instead engaged in material incentives, bonus taking the lead, and spread the counter-revolutionary economism wind. In pursuit of profits, they disregarded the needs of the masses, and even resorted to shoddy work, lowering product material standards, and harming the interests of consumers. In pursuit of completing production targets on the surface, they treated symptoms without addressing the root causes, focusing on quantity without considering quality, focusing on quality without considering consumption, focusing on consumption without considering specifications. In a few years, the factory experienced multiple quality accidents, causing serious waste.

    Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out: "We must, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, instill Chairman Mao's thoughts into workers and peasants, to change the spiritual face of the laboring people, to turn spiritual power into a great material force." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we seized power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in our factory. With the help of the leftist army from the 8341 Unit, the entire factory launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, turning the factory into a big classroom of Mao Zedong Thought, achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The spiritual face of all workers in the factory has undergone a new look. The revolution in thinking promoted the development of production. Last year, we overcame various difficulties and completed the annual production plan 22 days ahead of schedule. The entire factory also successfully experimented with more than a dozen technological innovations and successfully developed some new products with advanced levels. These facts thoroughly refuted the nonsense of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party who claim that "emphasizing politics will not improve production."

    We must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this sharpest weapon of the proletariat, thoroughly purge all the fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices in industrial enterprises, continuously promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, continuously develop socialist production, and make the greatest contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

### 必须用无产阶级政治统帅生产

    坚决批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命经济主义北京针织总厂革命工人和革命干部大批判文章选登
    编者按：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫在工厂企业中所推行的一套反革命修正主义路线，就是反对无产阶级政治挂帅，实行资产阶级政治挂帅，把工厂企业引向资本主义的邪路。
    无产阶级政治挂帅，就是毛泽东思想挂帅。用毛泽东思想挂帅，实现人的思想革命化，广大工人群众和革命干部社会主义劳动积极性就会充分发挥出来。北京针织总厂在八三四一部队同志帮助下所取得的成绩，就证明了这一点。
    在工厂企业中，坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，在当前，就是要发动广大革命工人和革命干部，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，条条落实和全面落实毛主席的最新指示，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的修正主义毒素，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思想，“抓革命，促生产”，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    必须用无产阶级政治统帅生产
    王瑞尧　王敏中
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，在一切事业中，必须坚持政治挂帅的原则，又说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”中国赫鲁晓夫公然反对毛主席的伟大指示，大肆鼓吹“生产挂帅”。他叫嚷说：“我国人民和党的主要任务，就是尽快地发展生产力”，“这是一切工作的任务”。“现在我们所做的一切工作，是如何尽快的发展生产力。”党内另一个最大的走资派更加露骨地跟着说：“工厂是做什么的？我看工厂的任务第一是生产。”
    我厂党内一小撮走资派，积极推销这条修正主义路线。他们创造了臭名昭著的“干货论”。我厂党内一个走资派疯狂叫嚣：“不管你说什么，不出‘干货’没用”。他们认为，无产阶级政治，阶级斗争，都是毫无用处的“水分”；生产、技术，才是唯一有用的“干货”。
    我厂党内走资派，跟着中国赫鲁晓夫等大搞“生产挂帅”，难道真的是为了社会主义建设，为了搞好生产吗？完全不是，也根本不可能。
    他们口里嚷的是“抓生产”，心里想的是完成各项生产指标，可以赚到更多的利润，可以骗取“红旗厂”的称号，作为个人向上爬的资本。
    在这种修正主义思想指导下，就必然要扭转社会主义的生产方向，必然要搞资本主义的经营管理，就必然要破坏社会主义生产，使工厂走上资本主义的轨道。在文化大革命以前，我厂党内一小撮走资派，根本不提倡活学活用毛主席著作，根本不抓人的思想革命化，不从根本上调动广大职工群众的社会主义生产积极性，而是大搞物质刺激，奖金挂帅，刮起反革命经济主义的妖风。为了追求利润，不顾群众需要，甚至不惜偷工减料，降低产品用料标准，损害消费者的利益。为了追求表面上完成生产指标，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，抓产量不顾质量，抓质量不顾消耗，抓消费不顾规格。在几年中，厂内出现多次质量事故，造成严重浪费。
    林彪副主席指出：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们夺了我厂党内一小撮走资派的权。在八三四一部队支左解放军的帮助下，全厂掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，把工厂办成了毛泽东思想的大课堂，实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。全厂职工的精神面貌焕然一新。思想革命推动了生产的发展。去年，我们克服了各种困难，提前二十二天完成了全年生产计划。全厂还试验成功十几项技术革新项目，试制成功一些具有先进水平的新产品。这些事实，彻底驳倒了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所谓的“突出政治搞不好生产”的胡言乱语。
    我们要牢牢掌握毛泽东思想这个无产阶级的最锐利的武器，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙在工业企业上所散布的一切谬论，不断促进人的思想革命化，不断发展社会主义生产，为中国革命和世界革命作出最大的贡献。
