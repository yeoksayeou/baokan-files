The Vietnamese *Nhan Dan* and *People's Army* newspapers published editorials on February 1, enthusiastically celebrating the recent glorious victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians on various battlefields.

The editorial in *Nhan Dan* stated that the South Vietnamese military and civilians launched simultaneous attacks on dozens of towns, capturing and controlling several important cities and areas, delivering heavy blows to the Saigon-based American and puppet strongholds. This demonstrates the magical power of people's war.

The editorial said: The series of attacks carried out and being carried out by the South Vietnamese military and civilians are a great victory for our soldiers and compatriots, and a heavy defeat for the American invaders and their lackeys. This is a great victory achieved through the close coordination and joint operations of the People's Liberation Armed Forces and various patriotic forces united under the banner of the National Liberation Front. The initiative, victory, and inevitable complete victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilians are being brilliantly demonstrated in the great offensive underway in various parts of the South. The passive situation, obvious failure, and inevitable complete defeat of the American aggressors are more concretely exposed in their panic and confusion.

The editorial said: The North Vietnamese military and civilians are greatly inspired by the glorious victories on the main front and will further heighten their vigilance, determined to thwart all U.S. escalation of the war, determined to excellently and over-fulfill all current tasks in combat, production, and organizational life, strengthen people's air defense, maintain public order, and fulfill the duties of the rear to the front.

The editorial in *People's Army* stated that the recent victories in the South prove that the South Vietnamese military and civilians not only hold the initiative, can fight and defeat the enemy in mountainous and plain battlefields, but also have sufficient strength to defeat the enemy in various cities and expand the victories to a very broad area.

The editorial said: The Vietnamese military and civilians are rapidly developing and strengthening their forces with great momentum, continuously attacking the enemy without giving them a chance to breathe. The editorial said: The battles are being fought with unprecedented ferocity. The Vietnamese nation is in the most glorious historical stage. The military and civilians on various battlefields in South Vietnam, on the basis of their victories, are advancing with great momentum, executing the orders of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, uniting as one, fighting shoulder to shoulder, continuously attacking the enemy with overwhelming superiority, and striving to expand the victories. The South Vietnamese military and civilians will certainly achieve even greater and more glorious victories, thereby bringing the great revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people to complete victory.
