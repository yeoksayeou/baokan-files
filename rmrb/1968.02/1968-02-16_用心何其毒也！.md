	How Vile Are Your Intentions!
	Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions	Wén Zhāo

	The number one traitor, China's Khrushchev, has always opposed our great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on political leadership. He relentlessly advocates material incentives and promotes the idea of money being in charge, using sugar-coated bullets to attack our working class. Under the direction of China's Khrushchev, some factories and mines have implemented a revisionist bonus system with numerous categories, levels, and frequencies. In terms of categories, there are competition bonuses, safety bonuses, attendance bonuses; in terms of levels, there are workshop-level, factory-level, and municipal-level bonuses; in terms of time, there are monthly bonuses, quarterly bonuses, half-year bonuses, and annual bonuses, etc. It is truly a bewildering array. In terms of rewards, they also make a big deal out of it, giving money to those who want it and giving goods to those who want them, such as blankets, wool fabric, violins, bicycles, etc. It is truly comprehensive and all-encompassing.

	You, China's Khrushchev, are full of the stench of copper coins. With your bourgeois mindset, you presume to understand the thoughts of the working class.

	You, China's Khrushchev, foolishly believe that you can buy off the working masses with "bonuses" and "money," corrupt the revolutionary will of the working class, and disintegrate the ranks of the working class.

	You, China's Khrushchev, foolishly believe that you can use material incentives to lure the working masses away from Mao Zedong Thought, making workers forget about the revolution and forget about socialism, so that you can freely restore capitalism.

	You, China's Khrushchev, how vile are your intentions!

	We, the working class, warn you: China's Khrushchev, you are dreaming during the day and harboring delusions!

    用心何其毒也！
    北京市总工会　文昭
    头号大工贼、中国赫鲁晓夫一贯同我们伟大领袖毛主席关于政治挂帅的教导唱反调，拚命地鼓吹物质刺激，宣扬金钱挂帅，用糖衣炮弹向我们工人阶级进攻。在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，一些厂矿企业搞了一套名目多、层次多、次数多的修正主义奖金挂帅的奖励制度。在名目上，有竞赛奖，安全奖，考勤奖；在层次上，有车间级，厂级，市级；在时间上，有月奖，季奖，半年奖，全年奖，等等，真是五花八门。在奖品上，也大作文章，要钱的给钱，要实物的给实物，什么毛毯、毛呢料子、小提琴、自行车，等等。真是一应俱全，应有尽有。
    你，中国赫鲁晓夫，浑身是铜臭味，以你资产阶级之心，度工人阶级之腹。
    你，中国赫鲁晓夫，妄想用“奖”、“钱”来收买工人群众，腐蚀工人阶级的革命意志，瓦解工人阶级队伍。
    你，中国赫鲁晓夫，妄想用物质刺激，来诱惑工人群众离开毛泽东思想，让工人忘记革命，忘记社会主义，以便你放手复辟资本主义。
    你，中国赫鲁晓夫，用心何其毒也！
    我们工人阶级正告你：中国赫鲁晓夫，你这是白日作梦，痴心妄想！
