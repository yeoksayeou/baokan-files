In the ever-snowy Qilian Mountains, at an altitude of over three thousand meters on the grasslands, there are a few rows of flat-roofed houses and a horse pen. This is the location of the certain military horse farm's Horse Team Three, which is hailed as a red banner on the military horse production front.

Here, whenever the sun rises, the herders who have been camping on the grasslands, facing the morning sun, chant in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sing "The East is Red" with full enthusiasm. A new day of struggle begins. They carry the revolutionary treasure, Chairman Mao's works, whip their horses, and are active on the boundless grasslands. The horses gallop, and they recite Chairman Mao's quotations on horseback; when the horses stop to graze, they gather in small groups, open the treasure book, and study, discuss, and deliberate. The entire horse farm is filled with a spirit of vigor, and the horses are fat and healthy. The young foals, carefully raised by the herders, are all jumping and playing.

Since Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the Military Commission and issued the decision to strengthen political and ideological work in the military, all personnel have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, steadfastly following the path of emphasizing politics. They have completed their military horse production tasks over and over again, and have been rated as a "Four-Good" unit for five years. Last year, despite poor grass growth and cold waves, the herders, with the boundless energy released during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, overcame a major natural disaster and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in military horse production.

Emphasizing politics, the red sun rises forever on the grasslands.

Under the Qilian Mountains is a good place to breed horses. After liberation, the herders, holding high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, built a military horse farm here. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing shouted that in modern warfare, these four-legged animals are outdated, attempting to abolish the horse farm; later, they spread bourgeois reactionary fallacies such as "technology is hard" and "politics is soft," disrupting the construction of the horse farm. The herders, who had suffered greatly in the old society, deeply understood that following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao is victory. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to resolutely fight against the class enemy.

In 1960, Vice Chairman Lin issued the great call to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. The herders, with boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, launched wave after wave of mass movements to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the sharp and complex struggle between the two lines. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the ancient grasslands and the horse farm.

The original team leader and party branch secretary, Zhang Kaiguo, was the pioneer in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Horse Team Three. He was forced to come to the horse farm during the period when the Nationalist reactionary warlord Ma Buqing ruled. After liberation, he grew from an ordinary herder to a team leader and went to Beijing three times to see the great leader Chairman Mao. He had experienced all the struggles between the two lines in the horse farm. Each time, he received profound education and raised his class consciousness. He often said to his comrades, "Without Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, there would be nothing for the proletariat and the working people. Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary treasures and the lifeblood of the poor. Without reading Chairman Mao's books, one's eyes are not clear; without reading Chairman Mao's books, one's heart is not red."

Zhang Kaiguo was originally illiterate, but later learned some culture. To quickly master Mao Zedong Thought, he overcame numerous difficulties. At night, when his companions had fallen asleep, he, despite the fatigue of a day's herding, sat under an oil lamp, concentrating on reading Chairman Mao's treasure books. Words he didn't understand, he pondered over and over; words he didn't recognize, he left to ask others the next day. The busier the work and the tighter the tasks, the more diligently and enthusiastically he studied. He consulted Chairman Mao on everything and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The masses praised him for truly regarding Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all work.

The horse farm's personnel are highly dispersed. Two or three people would herd a large group of horses to the grasslands, camping and eating outdoors for days. Add to this that most herders had never entered a school, making it very difficult to study Chairman Mao's works. Zhang Kaiguo and the cadres together rushed about on the grasslands every day, recalling bitterness and sweetness with the herders, arousing their deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, and inspiring their awareness to read Chairman Mao's books. They made the dispersed herders persist in the "Daily Reading" system, turned the night school for learning culture into a class for studying Chairman Mao's works, and spread the great Mao Zedong Thought to every household.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Here, the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works surged forward. In the dawn, under the moonlight, on the grasslands, in the dormitories, one could hear the sound of studying and reciting Chairman Mao's works everywhere. The herders would consult Chairman Mao before work, learning Mao's quotations related to their work and thoughts; after work, they would report to Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought to examine their day's work and thoughts. During shift changes, they would also use Chairman Mao's teachings to help and encourage each other. On snowy nights, the herders camping on the grasslands would gather together, bravely resisting the cold, and vigorously reciting the "Three Articles," sharing their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the night school, more and more people came, including women with children and elderly people with white hair. They studied the "Three Articles" with the young people and held meetings to share their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. Many families, with young herders and their parents and wives, held study competitions, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, transforming their worldviews.

People change their thoughts, teams change their appearance; under the Qilian Mountains, horses neigh joyfully.

Emphasizing politics, let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought guide production.

"Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Horse Team Three follows Chairman Mao's teachings and achieves one victory after another on the path of emphasizing politics.

When the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing advocated reactionary fallacies such as "technology first" and "business first," there was a period when some people here only focused on technology and business, not on politics, and in their work, only mentioned the "four goods": producing good foals in spring, good breeding in summer, good fat in autumn, and good pregnancy protection in winter.

Under the leadership of the party branch, the broad herders repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander and the soul, and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on strengthening political and ideological work. They criticized the erroneous actions of seeing things but not people. They loudly proposed new "four goods": to raise good horses, first do a good job with people's work; to do a good job with people's work, first revolutionize people's thoughts. Horses rely on people to raise, and people rely on Mao Zedong Thought to arm themselves.

There was once an incident here: the veterinarians encountered a sick horse. Relying on their old experience, they felt the problem was not big and did not pay much attention to it. As a result, the horse died from esophageal obstruction. Why did a horse that could have been treated die? The leadership and comrades helped them study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with this question in mind. The more they studied, the clearer their minds became. They said painfully, "Comrade Norman Bethune was a doctor, and he was extremely responsible for his work. We are veterinarians, but we are indifferent to sick horses. Why couldn't the horse be treated? The root of the problem is not in the level of technology, but in the lack of political responsibility."

Later, four horses fell seriously ill and lay on the ground for a long time, emaciated and skinny. The comrades shook their heads sadly, "It can't be treated!" The veterinarians bravely took on the task of treating these sick horses. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and Comrade Norman Bethune as an example, moving the veterinary room to the horse pen, and together with the comrades, they treated and cared for the horses day and night. They held the "Three Articles," spending sleepless nights, and finally treated the four horses.

The two completely different results made everyone further solidify their resolve to follow the path of emphasizing politics and further understand that the decisive factor is people, not things, politics, not technology. They said: focusing solely on business is a dead end; emphasizing politics is the bright path.

In the past, when the mare reached eighteen years old, her fertility would decrease, and she would be culled. The broad herders, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, did not believe in fate or the earth. They were determined to break through this old framework. They said, producing one more military horse is contributing one more effort to national defense construction and the world revolution.

At that time, some so-called "experts" emphasized that mares over eighteen years old should be culled as a "natural law" and had "scientific conclusions." The herders opened the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," where Chairman Mao said, "Where do correct ideas for the masses come from? Do they fall from the sky? No. Are they innate in the mind? No. Correct ideas can only come from social practice, only from the three kinds of practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." They wholeheartedly listened to Chairman Mao's words, daring to practice and practice repeatedly, saying proudly: With Chairman Mao pointing the way, no matter how much hardship and fatigue we endure, we are willing. They worked with great enthusiasm, tirelessly washing, treating, fattening, and training these old mares, finally making a batch of mares that had not been pregnant for several years and were supposed to be culled according to the usual rules, pregnant again.

In Horse Team Three, the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is held higher and higher, and the path of emphasizing politics is walked more firmly. Usually, everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, does ideological work, helps and learns from each other, promoting the revolutionization of thoughts. In situations where tasks are heavy and time is tight, they pay even more attention to emphasizing politics, focusing on and grasping living thoughts, letting political and ideological work lead the way, and appearing one after another with moving deeds of overcoming difficulties with human factors.

In the spring of 1967, they encountered a serious grass shortage. The drought of the previous year made the forage one-third less than usual. Should they quickly send people out to find grass, or should they strengthen political work, grasp people's thoughts, and give full play to people's roles? The party branch proposed that among all the conditions, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the first condition. They must use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome difficulties and overcome the grass shortage. They organized all the team members to study Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production" and self-reliance, overcoming difficulties. Chairman Mao's teaching, "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will trample all enemies underfoot, and will never be subdued by the enemy," gave the entire team boundless wisdom and strength. A mass campaign to overcome the grass shortage was launched vigorously. In the past, horses were not fed chopped grass, wasting a lot. Now, long grass is not brought into the pen, and rough feed is not put into the trough. In the past, the grazing time in spring was short. Now, every day they go to the grasslands two hours earlier to let the horses eat more grass. Spring grazing is very hard. The herders, carrying the "Three Articles," braved the wind and snow, got up early and worked late, fighting continuously for several months. Although each person lost a few pounds, the horses were all fat and healthy. The grass was not only enough but also supported brother units in critical moments.

Just after overcoming the grass shortage, in early May, a sudden major cold wave struck, with rain and snow mixed, and biting cold winds. This is the busy season for foaling, and foals are most likely to freeze to death, and mares are most likely to collapse. More than ten years ago, a sudden cold wave brought serious losses to the horse farm. Now, the broad herders have mastered this most sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. They can stand firm if the sky falls and fill the ground if it collapses.

The herders, in the days of rain and snow, repeatedly recited the "Three Articles," using the powerful quotations of Chairman Mao to help and encourage each other. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought commanded everyone to fight bravely.

One night, the herders were driving the horse herd across a river. Lightning and thunder, and a sudden flood scattered the horse herd. Several hundred pregnant mares ran wildly, and the foals followed, running back and forth. The mares were overworked and prone to miscarriage, and the foals could die at any moment. At this time, the grasslands echoed with the voices of "Resolutely carry out the decision, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The herders, disregarding everything, chased after the scattered horse herd. When the scattered horse herd rushed to a deep ditch, a few foals that had just been born were swept away by the whirlpool. The old herder Xu Dengdi and his comrades jumped off their horses, jumped into the rolling torrent. The icy snow water was piercingly cold, and their legs quickly lost sensation. It was the brightest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's teachings that inspired them to fight tenaciously. The foals were rescued, and the scattered horse herd was all found.

Politics is the commander, politics is the soul. Horse Team Three relies on Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing politics to create unprecedented miracles in military horse production history in the face of two major natural disasters.

Emphasizing politics, nurturing a new generation with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must cultivate and train millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution." Horse Team Three, in emphasizing politics, uses Mao Zedong Thought to arm people's minds, focusing on and grasping the revolutionization of people's thoughts, nurturing a new generation of communists.

Here, the cadres, whether they are team leaders, political instructors, or technicians, are mostly promoted from herders. These cadres are all pioneers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and live among the masses, maintaining the character of laborers.

When the herder Wang Hede was promoted to deputy team leader, he moved from the horse herd to the team office. Some workers joked with him, "You are now an 'official,' living in the office!" This ordinary remark made Wang Hede think deeply: in the past, he slept on the same grassland with his comrades, ate from the same bag of dry rations, and they were very close. Now, moving from the horse herd to the office, he had only lived there for two days and felt that talking to the herders was unnatural, as if there was an invisible barrier between them. He opened Chairman Mao's works, and Chairman Mao taught us to "wholeheartedly serve the people and never leave the masses for a moment." Chairman Mao's teachings made him deeply realize that this is not a matter of where to live, but a major issue of whether to leave the masses or not, whether to change color or not. He quickly moved back from the office to the horse herd and rolled with the herders again. In Horse Team Three, all cadres regard studying Chairman Mao's works with the herders and herding on the icy and snowy grasslands as a top priority. Whenever the weather is bad, wherever the work is difficult, and whatever the task is arduous, they appear there. Sometimes they stay on the grasslands for several shifts in a row, not returning home for ten days in the wilderness.

The most influential among the herders is when cadres bravely expose their selfishness and criticize it in front of the masses, transforming their worldviews and promoting the revolutionization of thoughts.

The news of the team's political instructor being promoted to the deputy manager of the division spread, immediately causing a stir among the masses: in terms of seniority and ability, the old team leader Zhang Kaiguo is not inferior to the political instructor, why is his position unchanged? Zhang Kaiguo seemed to have no problem on the surface, but his mind was in turmoil. At this time, the herd leader Zhang Yumin was in a bad mood because a worker was promoted to be his superior. Zhang Kaiguo wanted to talk to him but felt that his words were not convincing. He deeply felt that to help others criticize selfishness, he must first criticize his own selfishness. He immediately went to the masses, voluntarily exposing his thoughts and criticizing his selfish heart, thoroughly uprooting the poison of personal fame and gain. The masses and other cadres were deeply educated. Zhang Kaiguo, with deep class feelings, found Zhang Yumin to recall bitterness and sweetness together, study the "Three Articles" together, raised his class consciousness, and made him a good herd leader who wholeheartedly raises military horses and bravely criticizes selfishness.

Sunlight and rain nurture pines; Mao Zedong Thought nurtures new people. Horse Team Three has many young workers. Many people, when they first came to the horse farm, could not endure the hard life of irregular meals, irregular sleep, the grassland as home, and horses as companions, and were not settled in their work. However, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, they gradually established the spirit of taking hardship as honor and dedicating their lives to the revolution. They said, "I love the horse farm, I love horses. The horse farm is my home. Herders listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, with a red heart raising military horses." The young herder Chen Youyi came to the horse farm and was transferred to several teams, but did not work well. He thought that as a junior high school graduate, he could not "waste" his youth on a whip. When he was transferred to Horse Team Three, Zhang Kaiguo warmly welcomed him. Zhang Kaiguo understood: as long as Mao Zedong Thought is used to lead the team, there is no lamp that cannot be lit.

At first, Chen Youyi was still not settled in his work. Zhang Kaiguo enthusiastically helped him study Chairman Mao's works, insisted on positive education, and found that he had made some progress, and enthusiastically encouraged him, fully mobilizing his enthusiasm, and guiding him to consciously engage in ideological struggle. He had some culture, so he asked him to explain the "Three Articles" to the illiterate herders. In the process of guiding everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, a question arose for Chen Youyi: others have little education, but they learn a little and use a little of Chairman Mao's works, and the effect is immediate. Why can't he, who explains so well, learn and use it?

He studied Chairman Mao's works over and over again with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said, "Many intellectuals, they think they have a lot of knowledge, and they show off their knowledge, but they do not know that this is not good, it is harmful, and it hinders their progress. They should know a truth, that is, many so-called intellectuals are actually the most ignorant, and the knowledge of workers and peasants is sometimes a little more." The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated his heart. He thoroughly exposed and criticized the "self" in his mind, humbly regarded workers as his teachers, and diligently worked hard. Now, Chen Youyi is an active element in studying Chairman Mao's works in the division. He said with deep feelings, "Soldiers are like young seedlings, Mao Zedong Thought is the spring rain; roots are deep and leaves are lush all year round, and they do not bend in the wind and rain."

Under the sunlight and rain of Mao Zedong Thought, on the red path of emphasizing politics, a new generation is growing and striding forward, contributing to national defense construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    在突出政治的红色大道上
    ——记解放军总后勤部学习毛主席著作先进集体某军马场马三队
    在终年积雪的祁连山下，在海拔三千多米的草原上，有几排平房，一片马圈，这就是被誉为全军军马生产战线一面红旗的某军马场马三队的所在地。
    这里，每当旭日东升，风餐露宿在草滩上的牧工们，迎着朝阳，齐声祝愿毛主席万寿无疆，纵情高唱《东方红》。一天的战斗生活开始了。他们怀揣革命宝书毛主席著作，扬鞭驱马，活跃在一望无际的草原上。马儿奔驰，他们在马背上，一遍又一遍地背诵毛主席语录；马儿停下吃草，他们三三两两围坐在一起，打开宝书，边学边谈边议。整个马场，人们意气风发，骏马膘肥体壮，牧工精心抚养的小马驹儿，个个欢蹦乱跳。
    这里，自从林副主席主持军委工作，作出关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议以来，全体人员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地走突出政治的路，年年超额完成军马生产任务，五年被评为四好单位。去年，牧草歉收，寒流袭击，牧工们以在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，战胜了特大的自然灾害，夺得了军马生产史上空前大丰收。
    突出政治，草原升起了永远不落的红太阳
    祁连山下是繁殖马匹的好地方。解放后，牧工们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在这里大力建设军马场。反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，却大叫什么在现代化战争中，这四条腿的动物过时了，妄图把军马场砍掉；以后又散布“技术是硬的”、“政治是软的”等资产阶级的反动谬论，破坏军马场的建设。在旧社会受尽苦难的牧工，深深懂得：沿着毛主席指引的方向前进就是胜利。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，同阶级敌人进行了坚决的斗争。
    一九六○年，林副主席发出一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手的伟大号召，牧工们怀着无限热爱、无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情，在尖锐复杂的两条路线斗争中，掀起了一浪高过一浪的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，光焰无际的毛泽东思想，照亮了万古草原，照亮了军马场。
    原队长、党支部书记张开国，是马三队活学活用毛主席著作的带头人。他是解放前国民党反动军阀马步芳统治时期被迫来马场的。解放后，他从一个普通牧工成长为队长，三次上北京见到了伟大领袖毛主席。军马场的两条路线的斗争，他都经历过。每一次，他都受到了深刻教育，提高了阶级觉悟。他常对战友们说，没有毛主席的英明领导，没有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的一切。毛主席的书，是革命的宝书，是穷人的命根子。不读毛主席的书，眼就不明，不读毛主席的书，心就不红。
    张开国本来是个文盲，后来学了点文化。他为了尽快地把毛泽东思想学到手，克服了重重困难。深夜，伙伴们入睡了，他不顾一天放牧的劳累，坐在油灯下，聚精会神地读毛主席的宝书，不理解的话，反复琢磨；不识的字留下来第二天向别人请教。工作越忙，任务越紧，他学得越刻苦，越勤奋。他事事向毛主席请教，处处照毛主席指示办事，群众称赞他真正把毛泽东思想当作了一切工作的指导方针。
    马场，人员高度分散，两三个人赶着一大群马到了草滩，风餐露宿，一去就是几天，加上大部分牧工从来没有进过学校门，给学习毛主席著作带来很大困难。张开国和干部们一起，整天奔波在草滩上，和牧工一起忆苦思甜，激发他们对毛主席的深厚阶级感情，启发他们读毛主席书的自觉性。他们使分散放牧的工人坚持了雷打不动的“天天读”制度，他们把学文化的夜校办成了毛主席著作学习班，他们把伟大的毛泽东思想传遍家家户户。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。在这里，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动滚滚向前。晨曦中，月光下，草滩上，宿舍里，到处可以听到大学大背毛主席著作的声音。牧工们上班前向毛主席请示，针对自己的工作和思想，学毛主席语录；下班向毛主席汇报，用毛泽东思想检查一天的工作和思想。交接班时，他们还用毛主席的教导，互相帮助，互相鼓励。风雪交加的夜晚，露宿在草滩上的牧工们，红心抗严寒，热血溶冰雪，精神抖擞地聚集在一起，一遍又一遍地背诵“老三篇”，交流活学活用毛主席著作的心得体会。夜校里，人越来越多，连有孩子的妇女和白发苍苍的老人也来了，他们和青年人一起学“老三篇”，一起开学习毛主席著作讲用会。许多家庭，青年牧工和父母、妻子展开了学习竞赛，一起以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，改造世界观。
    人换思想队换貌，祁连山下马欢叫。
    突出政治，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅生产“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”马三队遵照毛主席的教导，在突出政治的大道上，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    在反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿鼓吹技术第一、业务第一等反动谬论的时候，这里有人一度只抓技术和业务，不抓政治，在工作中只提要抓“四个好”：春季把驹子产好，夏季把种配好，秋季把膘抓好，冬季把胎保好。
    广大牧工在党支部领导下，反复学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，学习林副主席关于加强政治思想工作的指示，批判了这种见物不见人的错误言行。他们响亮地提出新的“四个好”，要把马养好，先把人的工作做好，要把人的工作做好，先把人的思想革命化抓好。马靠人养，人靠毛泽东思想武装。
    这里曾发生过这样一件事：兽医室的同志有一次遇到一匹病马，他们凭老经验，感到问题不大，没放在心上，结果这匹马却因食道梗塞而死掉了。本来可以治好的马，为什么死掉了？领导上、同志们帮助他们带着问题学习《纪念白求恩》，越学他们心里越开朗。他们沉痛地说：“白求恩同志是个医生，他对工作极端负责任。我们是兽医，对病马却漠不关心。马为什么治不好，病根子不在技术高低，而在政治责任心不强。”
    后来，又有四匹马得了重病，长时间卧地不起，瘦得皮包骨头，同志们难过地摇摇头：“没法治了！”兽医室的同志们勇敢地承担治好这批病马的任务，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，以白求恩同志为榜样，把兽医室搬到了马圈，和同志们一起，昼夜治疗护理。他们手捧“老三篇”，度过了一个又一个不眠之夜，费尽了心血，终于把这四匹马治好了。
    这前后两种截然不同的结果，使大家进一步坚定了走突出政治的道路，进一步懂得了决定的因素是人不是物，是政治不是技术，他们说：单抓业务，死路一条；突出政治，光明大道。
    过去，马场母马到十八岁生育能力减低，就要被淘汰。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大牧工，不信天，不信地，决心冲破这个旧框框。他们说，多生产一匹军马，就是为国防建设、为世界革命多贡献一分力量。
    当时，有些所谓“专家”强调母马过十八岁就要淘汰是“自然规律”，有“科学结论”。牧工们打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，毛主席说：“人的正确思想是从那里来的？是从天上掉下来的吗？不是。是自己头脑里固有的吗？不是。人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”他们一心一意听毛主席的话，大胆实践，反复实践，豪迈地说：有毛主席给我们指出方向，吃再多的苦，受再多的累，我们也心甘情愿。他们干劲冲天，不厌其烦地对这些老母马进行洗涤、治疗、抓膘、调教，终于使一批几年没有怀胎，按常规要被淘汰的母马，重新受孕怀胎。
    在马三队，毛泽东思想伟大红旗越举越高，突出政治的道路越走越坚定。平时，他们人人读毛主席的书，个个做思想工作，互帮互学，促进思想革命化。在任务重、时间紧的情况下，他们更加重视突出政治，大抓狠抓活思想，让政治思想工作开路，出现了一个又一个靠人的因素战胜困难的动人事迹。
    一九六七年春，这里遇到了严重草荒。头一年的天旱，使饲草比往年少三分之一。是赶快派人四出找草，还是加强政治工作，抓人的思想，发挥人的作用？党支部提出，千条万条，活学活用毛主席著作是第一条，一定要用毛泽东思想战胜困难，战胜草荒。他们组织全队职工学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示和自力更生、克服困难的论述。毛主席“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导，给了全体职工无穷的智慧和力量。一个群众性的战胜草荒的战斗，轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。过去，喂马不铡草，浪费很多。现在长草不进圈，整料不进槽。过去，春天放牧时间短，现在每天提前两个小时赶马上草滩，尽量让马在草滩上多吃草。春天放牧十分辛苦。牧工们怀揣“老三篇”，风里来，雪里去，起早贪黑，连续战斗几个月，虽然每个人身上掉了几斤肉，但马儿一个个吃得膘肥体壮。马草不但够用，还在关键时刻支援了兄弟单位。
    刚刚战胜了草荒，五月初又突然受到特大寒流的袭击，雨雪交加，寒风刺骨。这是产驹大忙季节，幼驹最容易冻死，母马最容易倒毙。十多年前，一场突如其来的寒流，给马场带来严重损失。如今，广大牧工已经掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，天塌下来能顶住，地陷下去能填平。
    牧工们在雨雪交加的日子里，一次又一次背诵“老三篇”，用威力无穷的毛主席语录互相帮助，互相鼓励。战无不胜的毛泽东思想指挥着每一个人奋勇作战。
    一天深夜，牧工们正在赶着马群渡河，电闪雷鸣，山洪暴发，马群惊散了。几百匹怀孕的母马惊恐地奔驰着，马驹子跟在后面窜来窜去。母马劳累过度，容易流产，小驹子随时可能倒毙。这时候，草滩上响起了一片“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的声音。牧工们不顾一切地向惊散的马群追去。当惊散的马群冲到一条深沟的时候，几匹生下不久的小驹子被漩涡卷走。老牧工徐登第和战友们一起，翻身下马，跳进滚滚的激流。雪水冰凉刺骨，他们的两腿很快就失去了知觉。是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和毛主席的教导，激励着他们顽强战斗。马驹脱险了，惊散的马群全部找了回来。
    政治是统帅，政治是灵魂。马三队靠毛泽东思想，靠突出政治，在两次特大的自然灾害面前，创造了军马生产史上罕见的奇迹。
    突出政治，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想哺育一代新人
    毛主席教导我们：“要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”马三队在突出政治中，用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，大抓狠抓人的思想革命化，培养一代共产主义新人。
    这里的干部，不论是队长，指导员，还是技术员，大都是从牧工中提拔起来的。这些干部都是活学活用毛主席著作的带头人，都生活在群众之中，保持了劳动者的本色。
    牧工王和德刚提升副队长的时候，从马群搬进队部。有的工人和他开玩笑地说：“你现在当了‘官’，住上办公室啦！”这句普通的话引起了王和德的深思：过去和同志们睡一块草地，同吃一袋干粮，大家亲密无间。
    现在从马群搬到办公室，刚刚住了两天，就感到和牧工们说话不自然，好象有一种无形的东西在隔着似的。他打开了毛主席著作，毛主席教导我们要“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。毛主席的教导，使他深深地认识到：这不是住在那里的问题，而是脱离不脱离群众，变色不变色的大问题。他赶快从办公室搬回马群，又和牧工们滚在一起。在马三队，所有干部都把与牧工一起学习毛主席著作，一起在冰雪草原上放牧，永远保持普通牧工的本色，看作头等重要的大事。什么时候天气恶劣，什么地方工作困难，什么任务艰巨，他们就出现在那里，有时一连在草滩上顶几个班，十几天在野外不回家。
    在牧工中最有影响的，还是干部勇于到群众中亮私、斗私，改造世界观，促进思想革命化。
    这个队的指导员提升为分场教导员的消息一传开，在群众中立刻引起了一阵议论：论资格，论能力，老队长张开国都不比指导员差，为什么他原职未动？张开国表面看来没有啥，可是内心展开了思想斗争。正在这时，九群牧长张玉民因工人提升为自己上级而在闹情绪。张开国想找他谈谈，总觉得讲起来气不壮。他深深感到，要帮助别人斗私，首先得自己先斗私。于是他立即到群众中去，主动地亮思想斗私心，狠挖了个人名利的毒瘤。群众和其他干部，都深受教育。张开国怀着深厚的阶级感情，找到张玉民一起忆苦思甜，一起学“老三篇”，提高了他的阶级觉悟，使他成为一心养军马，勇于斗私的好牧长。
    阳光雨露育青松，毛泽东思想育新人。马三队的青年工人很多。许多人刚到马场，过不了这种食无定时，睡无定榻，草原为家，马儿为伴的艰苦生活，工作不安心。可是在毛泽东思想哺育下，他们逐渐树立了以艰苦为荣，为革命甩一辈子马鞭的雄心壮志。他们说：“我爱马场我爱马，马场就是我的家，牧工最听毛主席的话，一颗红心养军马。”青年牧工陈有年来到马场，先后调换了几个队，都没有好好工作。他认为自己是个初中生，不能把青春“浪费”在马鞭子上。当他调来马三队时，张开国高高兴兴地欢迎他。张开国懂得：只要用毛泽东思想来带队，没有拨不亮的灯。
    起初，陈有年还是不安心工作。张开国热情地帮助他学习毛主席著作，坚持正面教育，发现他有点滴进步，就热情鼓励，充分调动他的积极性，引导他自觉地进行思想斗争。他有文化，就叫他给不识字的牧工讲解“老三篇”。在辅导大家学习毛主席著作的过程中，一个问题引起陈有年深思：别人识字不多，可是，对毛主席著作学一点，用一点，立竿见影。而自己讲的头头是道，为什么不能学了就用呢？
    他带着问题一遍又一遍地学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“有许多知识分子，他们自以为很有知识，大摆其知识架子，而不知道这种架子是不好的，是有害的，是阻碍他们前进的。他们应该知道一个真理，就是许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。”光焰无际的毛泽东思想照亮了他的心。他狠亮狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，老老实实拜工人为老师，勤勤恳恳地埋头工作。现在，陈有年已经是场里学习毛主席著作积极分子。他深有感触地说：“战士好比小新苗，毛泽东思想春雨浇；根深叶茂常年绿，狂风暴雨不弯腰。”
  在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露下，在突出政治的红色大道上，一代新人在茁壮成长，阔步前进，为国防建设，为无产阶级文化大革命贡献着力量。
