Recently, the Soviet revisionist group's hired pen, Ernst Henry, published a series of anti-China articles titled "Observing from Pamir" in the Soviet revisionist's "Literature Newspaper." This anti-China clown, suddenly inspired, climbed up to the Pamir Plateau, near our border "only a few kilometers away," secretly "observing," hoping to grab a few straws. However, facing the red flags waving and the thunderous spring storms of China, facing the torrential downpour of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he can only wail like an autumn insect in despair.

This clown hates to the core the fact that our country has become the center of world revolution, that our country is strongly supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and that our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved brilliant victories. He is terrified of the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought, and he gnashes his teeth in cursing China as an "empire" that "waves the red flag of socialism," a "Genghis Khan of socialism," and accuses China of "adding fuel to the fire everywhere in the world," and so on. It is extremely vicious.

In fact, these slanders are nothing new; they are just old rubbish picked up from the likes of Khrushchev. Didn't Khrushchev and his ilk once shout about the "yellow peril" and the "threat of Genghis Khan"? And the things Khrushchev and his ilk shouted about were nothing more than rotten black goods dug up from the tomb of German Emperor Wilhelm II.

Just when the Russian 1905 Revolution and the democratic revolution swept through China and many Asian countries, Wilhelm II, in order to further divide China, invade Asia, suppress the Asian revolution, divert the attention of European peoples' revolution, and prepare for the outbreak of imperialist world war, he shamelessly propagated the "yellow peril" theory. However, this reactionary theory did not save his life. Soon after, this extremely reactionary imperialist leader, along with his reactionary "yellow peril" theory, was finished. While China and the Asian revolution were advancing victoriously.

Wilhelm II has long been finished, and Khrushchev has long been overthrown. The powerful revolutionary storm is not only sweeping Asia but also Africa and Latin America. At this time, Khrushchev's successors and their hired scholars, imitating the tone of the "yellow peril" theorists, maliciously curse China as an "empire" and a "Genghis Khan." Isn't this doubly reactionary and doubly stupid?

Here, we must clearly tell the small group of traitors in the Soviet revisionist clique that we are determined to "add fuel to the revolutionary fire everywhere in the world," to support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, to support all revolutionary armed struggles and revolutionary wars, to "make the fire burn red-hot," to turn the sparks of revolutionary rebellion into a raging inferno, to let the revolutionary fires of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries burn throughout the globe, and to burn all the cannibals in the world to death!

At all times, we will resolutely carry out the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should aid the struggles of the peoples who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty."

The small group of traitors in the Soviet revisionist clique have long degenerated into the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. They play the shameful role of the counter-revolutionary "fire brigade" everywhere in the world, committing the evil deed of extinguishing the revolutionary fires of the oppressed peoples and nations. The Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world will resolutely seize their evil hands and will not allow their conspiracy to extinguish the revolutionary fire to succeed!

Bats are most afraid of the sun's rays, and reactionaries are most afraid of the voice of truth. It is not surprising that the Soviet revisionist traitors are spreading lies and slanders about the great People's Republic of China. From the German Emperor Wilhelm II of yesteryears to today's U.S. imperialist leader Johnson, from the old revisionists Bernstein and Kautsky to the modern revisionists Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin, which one of them is not terrified to death of the revolution of the peoples of all countries and the widespread dissemination of revolutionary truth! In the past, the reactionaries of all countries maliciously cursed the Soviet power established by Lenin as "Red Imperialism," precisely because the great October Socialist Revolution took place in Russia, and because the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to the peoples of the world. Today, the Soviet revisionist traitors are madly cursing China as an "empire" that "waves the red flag of socialism," precisely because the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which shook the world, took place in China, and because this revolutionary movement has made the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought—even more widely disseminated and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people around the world. This is precisely what imperialism and all reactionaries fear the most.

Under the brilliant leadership of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary peoples of the world—Chairman Mao—China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already achieved decisive victories. The revolutionary peoples of the world have seen the future and hope of mankind in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have an infinite love, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. They recognize that only the path of the Chinese revolution is the path of thorough revolution, and only Mao Zedong Thought can lead the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations to final victory. They enthusiastically acclaim that today the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner.

As Chairman Mao said: "The day the people rejoice is the day the counter-revolutionaries suffer." The imperialists led by the United States and their running dogs, the modern revisionists and the reactionaries of all countries, are trembling all over their bodies from the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They sense the approach of their doom. Therefore, they are operating all their propaganda machines, issuing mad shouts and desperate wails. As Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "They are racking their brains, cursing and slandering our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which precisely proves from the opposite side that our victory has struck them heavily, and they are just a bunch of vampires that will inevitably perish."

Let a few flies buzz! Let the autumn insects wail! The great socialist China stands like a giant on the world stage. The torrent of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rolls forward, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is surging across the world like a tidal wave. The lifespan of all harmful creatures in the world will not be long!

### 秋虫的悲鸣

    秋虫的悲鸣
    上海复旦大学　郭洪
    不久前，苏修集团的御用文人厄恩斯特·亨利在苏修《文学报》上连续刊登了题为《从帕米尔观望》的反华奇文。这个反华小丑，忽然心血来潮，爬上帕米尔高原，在离我国边境“只有几公里”的地方，偷偷“观望”，竟想捞几根稻草。然而，面对着红旗招展、春雷滚动的中国大地，面对着无产阶级文化大革命的急风骤雨，他只能象秋虫一样，发出几声绝望的悲鸣。
    这个小丑对我国成为世界革命的中心，对我国大力支持亚非拉各国人民的革命斗争恨得要命，对我国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，对毛泽东思想的广泛传播怕得要死，咬牙切齿地咒骂中国是“打着社会主义红旗”的“帝国”，是“社会主义的成吉思汗”，“在世界上到处火上加油”，等等。真是恶毒之极。
    其实，这一派无耻谰言并不新鲜，不过是从赫鲁晓夫之流那里捡来的破烂。赫鲁晓夫之流不是曾经叫嚷过什么“黄祸”，什么“成吉思汗的威胁又来了”吗？而赫鲁晓夫之流叫嚷的东西，又不过是从德国皇帝威廉第二的坟墓里挖出来的、早已腐烂了的黑货而已。
    正当俄国一九○五年革命前后，民主革命席卷中国和许多亚洲国家的时候，威廉第二为了进一步瓜分中国，侵略亚洲，镇压亚洲的革命，转移欧洲人民革命的视线，并且为准备发动帝国主义世界大战制造烟幕，他曾经无耻地宣扬过什么“黄祸论”。然而，这种反动理论并没有能够救了他的命。事隔不久，这个反动透顶的帝国头目连同他的反动的“黄祸论”一起完蛋了。而中国和亚洲的革命却在胜利地前进。
    威廉第二早已完蛋了，赫鲁晓夫也早已垮台了，强大的革命风暴不仅席卷着亚洲，而且席卷着非洲和拉丁美洲。在这样的时候，赫鲁晓夫的继承者及其御用学者又学着“黄祸论”者的腔调，恶毒地咒骂中国是什么“帝国”，是什么“成吉思汗”，岂不是加倍的反动，加倍的愚蠢吗！
    在这里，我们还要明明白白地告诉苏修集团的一小撮叛徒，我们就是要“在世界上到处”为革命之火“加油”，就是要支持各国人民的革命斗争，就是要支持一切革命的武装斗争和革命战争，就是要“把那炉火烧得通红”，让革命造反的星星之火变成熊熊的燎原大火，就是要让各国人民反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义、反对各国反动派的革命烈火燃遍全球，把世界上的一切吃人魔鬼通通烧死！
    我们任何时候都坚决地执行我们的伟大领袖毛主席的指示：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”
    苏修集团的一小撮叛徒，你们早已堕落为美帝国主义的头号帮凶。你们在世界上到处充当反革命
  “消防队”的可耻角色，到处去干扑灭被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命烈火的罪恶勾当。中国人民和全世界革命人民坚决要抓住你们的罪恶黑手，坚决不准许你们扑灭革命之火的阴谋得逞！
    蝙蝠最怕太阳的光辉，反动派最怕真理的声音。苏修叛徒对伟大的中华人民共和国大肆造谣诬蔑，并不奇怪。从当年的德国皇帝威廉第二到今天的美帝国主义头子约翰逊，从老修正主义者伯恩斯坦、考茨基到现代修正主义者赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，他们哪一个不是对各国人民的革命，对革命真理的广泛传播怕得要死！当年，各国反动派恶毒地咒骂列宁缔造的苏维埃政权是“赤色帝国主义”，就是因为在俄国发生了伟大的十月社会主义革命，就是因为十月革命给全世界人民带来了马克思列宁主义。今天，苏修叛徒们疯狂地咒骂中国是“打着社会主义红旗”的“帝国”，也就是因为在中国发生了震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，就是因为这场革命运动使当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想在全世界范围内更加广泛传播，深入人心。这正是帝国主义和一切反动派最害怕的事情。
    在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的天才领导下，中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性的胜利。世界革命人民从中国无产阶级文化大革命中看到了人类的前途和希望。他们对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。他们认识到，只有中国革命的道路才是彻底革命的道路，只有毛泽东思想才能把被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争引向最后的胜利。他们热烈欢呼，今天世界已经进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    正如毛主席所说的：“人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”以美国为首的帝国主义和它们的走狗现代修正主义和各国反动派，被中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利吓得浑身发抖，他们预感到自己的末日的来临。于是，他们开动一切宣传机器，发出疯狂的叫喊和绝望的悲鸣。正如林彪副主席所指出的那样：“他们费尽心机，咒骂、毁谤我们的无产阶级文化大革命，正好从反面证明了我们的胜利对敌人的打击是多么沉重，而他们只是一群必将灭亡的吸血鬼而已。”
    让几只苍蝇去嗡嗡叫吧！让那些秋虫去悲鸣吧！伟大的社会主义的中国象巨人一样巍然屹立在世界上，中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨流滚滚向前，战无不胜的毛泽东思想正以排山倒海之势磅礴于全世界。世界上一切害人虫的寿命不会太长了！
