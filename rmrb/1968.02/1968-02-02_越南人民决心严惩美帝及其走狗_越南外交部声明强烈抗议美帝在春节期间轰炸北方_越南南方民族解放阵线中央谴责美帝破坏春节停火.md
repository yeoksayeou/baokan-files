The Vietnamese people are determined to severely punish U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement strongly protesting U.S. bombing of the North during the Spring Festival. The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam condemned U.S. sabotage of the Spring Festival ceasefire.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 1: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 30, severely condemning the U.S. imperialists for sending military aircraft to bomb and strafe North Vietnam during the Vietnamese people's traditional festival, the Spring Festival.

	The statement said that on January 29, the first day of the Spring Festival in North Vietnam, U.S. military aircraft attacked many residential areas in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and launched rockets at some places in the suburbs of Hanoi, such as the counties of Tu Liem and Gia Lam.

	The statement said: It is well known that on November 17, 1967, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued an order to stop military attacks for seven days during the Vietnamese Spring Festival, so that the people of South Vietnam could celebrate the Spring Festival and so that the puppet military and political personnel could reunite with their families according to ancient Vietnamese customs. This order received strong support from the Vietnamese people and sympathy from world public opinion. However, the U.S. imperialists exposed their extremely stubborn nature: they announced a "ceasefire" for two days, then reduced it to 36 hours, and then canceled the ceasefire for five provinces in South Vietnam and the southern part of North Vietnam, and finally completely canceled the 1968 Spring Festival ceasefire.

	The statement strongly protests against the above-mentioned evil actions of U.S. imperialism and its lackey traitors.

	The statement pointed out: No matter what tricks and schemes the U.S. imperialists play, they cannot save their obvious failure in South Vietnam. The people of North and South Vietnam are determined to advance the victories they have already achieved and give the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys the punishment they deserve.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 1: According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued an order on January 30, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism for sabotaging the Spring Festival ceasefire and ordering the military and people of the South to severely punish the American aggressors. The order said: In recent years, the people of South Vietnam have achieved continuous victories in their struggle against the Americans and for national salvation. The United States is in a state of serious passivity and failure; the puppet military forces of the United States are rapidly disintegrating.

	The order said: According to our national traditions, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued an order to stop military attacks for seven days during the Spring Festival. The U.S.-puppet group, in order to cover up their evil intentions, also announced that they would cease fire for 48 hours, but later reduced it to 36 hours. Subsequently, they canceled the 36-hour ceasefire in five northern provinces of South Vietnam on January 29 and 30. Finally, at 14:00 on January 30, they sent aircraft and artillery to bombard densely populated areas, killing and suppressing our compatriots.

	The order pointed out: The stubborn and shameful actions of the United States and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky group have aroused the indignation of people of all classes in the country and the people of the world.

	The order said: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front orders all kinds of people's armed forces, all kinds of political struggle forces, and all members of various liberation associations, together with all other patriotic forces and compatriots, to charge forward and resolutely give the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky traitor group the punishment they deserve.

	The spokesperson of the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam also exposed and condemned the evil deeds of U.S. imperialism and the puppet group in sabotaging the Spring Festival ceasefire in a statement on January 30. The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism and the puppet group must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by their arrogant actions.

	On January 30, the liberation army of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam launched its eighth raid on the U.S. Air Force base in Da Nang. According to Western news agencies, at least 42 U.S. planes were destroyed or damaged. The photo shows the wreckage of a U.S. plane, reduced to a pile of scrap metal, at the U.S. Air Force base in Da Nang.

	The tattered and torn U.S. national emblem lies in front of the U.S. "Embassy," which has been riddled with holes. This is an excellent portrayal of the U.S. paper tiger, which is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the Vietnam War.

    越南人民决心严惩美帝及其走狗
    越南外交部声明强烈抗议美帝在春节期间轰炸北方
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央谴责美帝破坏春节停火
    新华社河内一日电  越南民主共和国外交部发言人一月三十日发表一项声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义者在越南人民的传统节日——春节期间派遣军用飞机轰炸和扫射越南北方。
    声明说，一月二十九日，在越南北方春节的第一天，美国军用飞机袭击了越南民主共和国的许多居民区，并向河内郊区自廉县与嘉林县的一些地方发射了火箭。
    声明说：众所周知，一九六七年十一月十七日，越南南方民族解放阵线发布了在越南春节期间停止军事进攻七天的命令，以便越南南方人民能够庆祝春节，使傀儡军政人员也能按照越南古老的风俗习惯同家庭团聚。这一命令得到了越南人民的热烈支持和世界舆论的同情。但是美帝国主义者却暴露了他们极端顽固的本性：他们宣布“停火”两天，随即减为三十六小时，然后又取消了对越南南方五省和越南北方南部的停火，最后完全取消了一九六八年春节的停火。
    声明表示强烈抗议美帝国主义者及其走狗卖国贼的上述罪恶行动。
    声明指出：美帝国主义者不论玩弄什么样的阴谋诡计，都不能挽救他们在越南南方所遭到的明显的失败。越南南北两方人民决心把已经取得的胜利推向前进，给美帝国主义者及其仆从以罪有应得的惩罚。
    新华社河内一日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团一月三十日发布一项命令，强烈谴责美帝国主义破坏春节停火，命令南方军民严惩美国强盗。命令说：几年来，越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争接连取得胜利。美国正在陷入严重的被动和失败；美国的雇佣工具伪军，正在加速瓦解。
    命令说：根据我们民族的传统风俗，南方民族解放阵线发布了在春节期间停止军事进攻七天的命令。美伪集团为了掩盖他们的不可告人的野心，也不得不宣布他们将停火四十八小时，但后来缩短到三十六小时，随后，又在一月二十九日和三十日在越南南方北部五个省撤销了三十六小时的停火令。最后，在一月三十日十四时，派遣飞机和炮兵，轰击各个居民稠密区，残杀和镇压我们的同胞。
    命令指出：顽固的美国和阮文绍—阮高其集团的野蛮和可耻行动，激起了我们全国各阶层人民以及世界人民的愤慨。
    命令说：民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团命令所有各种人民解放武装力量、各种政治斗争力量和各个解放协会的全体会员，同其他各种爱国力量和全体同胞并肩在一起，冲上前去，坚决给予美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其卖国走狗集团以应得的惩罚。
    越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部发言人一月三十日在一项声明中也揭露和谴责了美帝国主义及南越傀儡集团破坏春节停火的罪恶行径。声明指出，美帝国主义和傀儡集团必须承担由他们的狂妄行动所引起的严重后果的全部责任。
