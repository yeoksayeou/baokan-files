When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atomic bomb of immense power.

Chairman Mao's works are the most powerful ideological weapons.

Wang Yin'e, Deputy Political Instructor, Militia Camp, Qi Village, Xin County, Shanxi Province

Comrade Lin Biao calls on us, "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao." Yet, another major capitalist-roader within the Party viciously curses our workers, peasants, and soldiers for their efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, calling it "excessive taxation."

In our era, whether one loves or opposes Chairman Mao and his works has become the touchstone for distinguishing revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries. All revolutionary people have boundless admiration for Chairman Mao, regarding his books as the lifeblood of the revolution; while all counter-revolutionaries always fiercely attack Mao Zedong Thought, sabotaging the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks what words. The fact that the major capitalist-roader within the Party attacks and slanders the workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is a vivid portrayal of his own ugly, counter-revolutionary face.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "If the enemy opposes us, that is good; if the enemy vigorously opposes us, that is even better. If the enemy attacks us, that proves we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, that proves not only have we drawn a clear line with the enemy, but also our work has achieved great success." The major capitalist-roader within the Party vigorously opposes and sabotages our study of Chairman Mao's works, which precisely shows that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have achieved great success and produced tremendous power in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

I am a militia cadre. Our militia's task is to safeguard the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. To fulfill the tasks assigned by the Party, we must master weapons. Countless facts have made me deeply realize: the most powerful and effective weapon is not machine guns, cannons, tanks, or airplanes, but the radiant works of Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Seriously studying Chairman Mao's books, having Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we will never lose our way. Not only can we defeat the armed enemy, but we can also timely discover and expose the enemy who does not carry weapons. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I and the revolutionary comrades in our militia camp were attacked and persecuted by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They used the same methods as the Chinese Khrushchev and the major capitalist-roader within the Party, distorting right and wrong, confusing black and white, slandering me as a "black model" of studying Chairman Mao's works, and our militia camp as a "black organization"; they, a handful of bad elements, were "revolutionary." For a time, it was chaotic and filled with white terror. However, the more difficult the situation, the more we insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works. We thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." We had boundless energy and became more determined to defeat the enemy and achieve victory. On one hand, we used Chairman Mao's teachings to unite and educate the broad masses; on the other hand, we exposed and denounced the anti-Party, anti-socialist crimes of a handful of bad elements, finally smashing their plot to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and exposing their reactionary faces to the broad masses.

Is studying and applying Chairman Mao's works "excessive taxation"? This is pure counter-revolutionary talk. I am the daughter of a poor peasant. In the old society, my family suffered oppression and exploitation, and we could not eat or dress properly. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we poor people have stood up and become masters of the country. Especially with Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have exposed a handful of bad elements led by the Chinese Khrushchev and the major capitalist-roader within the Party, and we can better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieving ideological revolutionization. We have never been as spirited, enthusiastic, and full of vigor as we are now. We have personally experienced: the more we repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works, the redder our hearts, the brighter our eyes, and the greater our enthusiasm; the more we can see through the enemy's tricks in the sharp and complex class struggle, fight accurately, fight fiercely, and fight satisfactorily. Chairman Mao's works are the most precious revolutionary treasure. Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the first need of revolutionary people. The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most solid iron wall, the greatest fighting force, and all enemies in the world will be defeated by us!

Take our production brigade as an example. During the Cultural Revolution, we insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness." Our brigade, like the rest of the country, has seen an unprecedented good situation. The leadership of our brigade is firmly in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Especially, a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has emerged in every household, young and old. People change their minds, the earth changes its appearance. Last year's agricultural production, despite suffering from drought, pests, and floods, still achieved a bumper harvest.

"The day the people rejoice is the day the counter-revolutionaries suffer." Let the major capitalist-roader within the Party and the Chinese Khrushchev, together with the billion people, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a great wave, be swept into the garbage heap of history!

### 毛主席著作是最强大的思想武器

    毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量， 变成威力无比的精神原子弹。
    毛主席著作是最强大的思想武器
    山西省忻县奇村民兵营副教导员　王银娥
    林彪副主席号召我们，“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”党内另一个最大的走资派却恶毒地咒骂我们工农兵努力活学活用毛主席著作是“苛捐杂税”。
    在我们的时代，对待毛主席和毛主席著作是热爱还是反对，已经成为识别革命派和反革命派的试金石。一切革命人民都无限崇拜毛主席，把毛主席的书看成是革命的命根子；而一切反革命分子，总是疯狂地攻击毛泽东思想，破坏活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。党内另一个最大的走资派攻击、诬蔑工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，不正是活龙活现地画出他自己的一副老反革命的丑恶嘴脸吗？
    毛主席教导我们说：“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”党内另一个最大的走资派起劲地反对、破坏我们学习毛主席著作，这正好说明广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作取得了很大成绩，产生了巨大的威力。
    我是一个民兵干部。我们民兵的任务是保卫社会主义革命和社会主义建设，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。我们民兵要担负起党所交给的任务，就要掌握武器。无数事实使我深深体会到：最强大、最有效的武器，不是机枪、大炮，也不是坦克、飞机，而是光芒万丈的毛主席著作，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。认真读毛主席的书，头脑里有了毛泽东思想，就永远不会迷失方向。就不仅能够打败拿枪的敌人，而且也能够及时发现和揪出不拿枪的敌人。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我和我们民兵营的革命同志，曾经受到党内一小撮走资派的围攻、迫害。他们采用和中国赫鲁晓夫、党内另一个最大的走资派同样的手法，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，诬蔑我是学习毛主席著作的“黑标兵”，民兵营是“黑组织”；他们一小撮坏人倒是“革命”的。一时搞得乌烟瘴气，一片白色恐怖。但是，我们越是在困难的时候，越是坚持学习毛主席著作。我们想到毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”我们就有使不完的劲，更加坚定了斗倒敌人、取得胜利的信心。我们一方面用毛主席的教导去团结教育广大群众，一方面揭露、控诉一小撮坏人的反党反社会主义罪行，终于粉碎了一小撮坏人破坏文化大革命的阴谋，并且把他们的反动面目暴露在广大群众面前。
    活学活用毛主席著作是“苛捐杂税”吗？这是地地道道的反革命论调。我是贫农的女儿。我们一家大小，在旧社会里受压迫挨剥削，吃不饱穿不暖。在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，我们穷人才翻了身，做了国家的主人。特别是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把以中国赫鲁晓夫、党内另一个最大的走资派为首的一小撮坏家伙揪了出来，我们就能够更好地活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化。我们从来也没有象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。我们亲身体会到：越是反复学习毛主席著作，心越红，眼越亮，干劲越大；越能在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，识破敌人的鬼花招，打得准，打得狠，打得痛快。毛主席著作是最最珍贵的革命法宝，活学活用毛主席著作是革命人民的第一需要。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众是最坚固的铜墙铁壁，是最大的战斗力，世界上任何敌人都要被我们打败！
    拿我们大队来说，在文化大革命中坚持活学活用毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备。”我们大队同全国一样，出现了空前未有的大好形势。我们大队的印把子紧紧地掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。特别是出现了家家户户男女老少活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。人换思想地换装，去年的农业生产，在遭到旱、虫、涝灾的情况下，仍然取得丰收。
    “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”让党内另一个最大的走资派和中国赫鲁晓夫一起，在亿万群众大学大用毛主席著作的洪流中，被冲进历史垃圾堆吧！
