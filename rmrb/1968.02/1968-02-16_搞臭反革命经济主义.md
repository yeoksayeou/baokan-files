Title: Exposing Counter-Revolutionary Economism

Mao Zedong taught us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Yet, China's Khrushchev stands on the reactionary bourgeois stance, frenziedly opposing Mao Zedong Thought, opposing the prominence of proletarian politics. In industrial and mining enterprises, he vigorously promotes the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, advocating material incentives, and absurdly claims that "material incentives are necessary," vigorously promoting the supremacy of money.

As early as 1950, China's Khrushchev directed the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Peng Zhen to offer a reward of 40,000 catties of rice in our factory to "solve the problem of coal dust leakage in the power generation equipment." The master gives the order, and the servant follows. At that time, a black wind of "struggling for 40,000 catties of rice" swept through our factory.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, following the instructions of China's Khrushchev, vigorously promoted the "skill grading" system in our factory. They did not care about politics or who the person was; as long as one had "skills," produced well, and was "obedient," they would reward them with money and rank, encouraging young workers to take the "expert but not red" path, cultivating the seeds of revisionism.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, following the instructions of China's Khrushchev, formulated more than 30 specific material incentive reward systems in our factory. There were annual bonuses, monthly bonuses, quarterly bonuses, safety bonuses, coal-saving and electricity-saving bonuses, small target bonuses, collective contract bonuses, apprentice contract bonuses, holiday bonuses, full-attendance bonuses, and even "trick bonuses," "hard work bonuses," and "consolation bonuses" to appease sentiments. It was truly a plethora of bizarre and varied schemes. In our factory, there was a coal crusher that was moved three times. Each time it was moved, a "rationalization suggestion bonus" was awarded. In the end, the coal crusher was moved back to its original place, and another bonus was awarded. Even feeding the livestock at night for the factory was rewarded with a high "mule-feeding allowance" of 40 yuan. In short, it was all about "paying for work"!

It is clear that China's Khrushchev and his agents in the former Beijing Municipal Committee spared no effort in promoting the counter-revolutionary goods of material incentives, attempting to poison the souls of workers, corrupt their thoughts, and seize the leadership of the working class in terms of ideology, politics, and organization, realizing their dream of restoring capitalism.

Promoting material incentives is not only a poisoned arrow used by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the former Beijing Municipal Committee to corrupt workers and restore capitalism; it is also a big stick they use to suppress workers and implement bourgeois dictatorship. While issuing numerous high-value bonuses, they severely punish workers who dare to resist their counter-revolutionary revisionist line, often threatening them with "deductions from wages."

The counter-revolutionary economism tactics played by China's Khrushchev have been firmly resisted by revolutionary workers. Whether to prioritize politics or money, whether to promote ideological revolution or material incentives, this is a fundamental difference between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and modern revisionism. China's Khrushchev and his gang vigorously promote the supremacy of money and counter-revolutionary economism, which are genuine revisionist trash, picked from the garbage heap of Soviet revisionism. We, the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly reject these trash items and expose the fallacies of China's Khrushchev's material incentives. We, the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and for the Chinese revolution and world revolution, for the great ideal of communism, and for the complete liberation of the people of the world, we will work selflessly!

    搞臭反革命经济主义
    北京石景山发电厂　戴华忠
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”中国赫鲁晓夫却站在反动的资产阶级立场上，疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治。他在工矿企业大肆推行反革命修正主义路线，大搞物质刺激，胡说什么“物质刺激是必要的”，极力鼓吹钞票挂帅。
    早在一九五○年，中国赫鲁晓夫就指使反革命修正主义分子彭真，在我厂以四万斤小米的悬赏，“解决发电设备漏煤粉的问题”。主子发指示，奴才紧跟上。当时，在我们厂里就刮起了一阵“为四万斤小米而奋斗”的黑风。
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，在我们厂里大搞什么“考工升级”。他们不问政治，不管是什么人，只要“有技术”，“生产好”，“听话”，都可论功行赏，用钱和级别鼓励青年职工走“白专”道路，培养修正主义的苗子。
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，在我们厂里制订了三十多种具体推行物质刺激的奖励制度。什么年奖，月奖，季奖，安全奖，省煤节电奖，小指标奖，集体合同奖，师徒合同奖，节日奖，全勤奖，还有什么“窍门奖”，“辛苦奖”，以及为了照顾情绪的“安慰奖”，等等。真是五花八门，无奇不有。我们厂里有一台碎煤机，曾经三次搬家，每搬一次就发一次“合理化建议奖”，最后，这台碎煤机又搬回原处，照旧又发了一次奖。甚至晚上给厂里喂喂牲口，也发给高达四十元的“养骡子津贴”。一句话，就是“干活给钱”！
    十分明显，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在旧北京市委的代理人不遗余力地推行物质刺激的反革命黑货，就是企图用钱来毒害工人的灵魂，腐蚀工人的思想，从思想上、政治上、组织上夺取工人阶级的领导权，实现他们复辟资本主义的美梦。
    推行物质刺激不仅是中国赫鲁晓夫及其在旧北京市委的代理人腐蚀工人、复辟资本主义的糖衣炮弹；也是他们压制工人，实行资产阶级专政的一根大棒。他们在颁发名目繁多的高额奖金的同时，对敢于抵制他们的反革命修正主义路线的工人实行重罚，动不动就以“扣工资”相威胁。
    中国赫鲁晓夫耍的这一套反革命经济主义手段，受到革命工人的坚决抵制。是政治挂帅，还是钞票挂帅；是搞思想革命化还是搞物质刺激，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和现代修正主义的一个根本分歧。中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙大搞钞票挂帅，大搞反革命经济主义，是地地道道的修正主义臭货，是从苏修的垃圾堆里拣来的破烂。我们工人阶级坚决扔掉这些破烂，批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的物质刺激谬论。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，坚决遵照毛主席的教导，为了中国革命和世界革命，为了共产主义的伟大理想，为了世界人民的彻底解放而忘我劳动！
