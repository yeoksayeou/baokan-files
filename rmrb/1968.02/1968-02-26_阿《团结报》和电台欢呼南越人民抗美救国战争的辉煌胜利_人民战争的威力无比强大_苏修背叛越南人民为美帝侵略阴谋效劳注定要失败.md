The Albanian "Unity" newspaper and radio station enthusiastically celebrated the glorious victory of the heroic South Vietnamese people in their recent Tet Offensive, denouncing the U.S.-Soviet collusion in pushing the "peace talks" plot.

The article said: The recent offensive launched by the South Vietnamese people has inflicted a heavy defeat on the U.S. aggressors. The brave and swift attacks by the South Vietnamese people have once again convincingly and irrefutably proven the immense and boundless power of the people's war, proving that the heroic Vietnamese people have already taken the initiative in the war, and the U.S. aggressors have no power to resist this great people's war.

The article said: The consecutive defeats suffered by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand have dealt a fatal blow to its counter-revolutionary global strategy.

The article exposed: To salvage the inevitable defeat of the U.S. in Vietnam, all allies of the U.S., including the Soviet revisionists, are actively promoting the "peace talks" ruse for the U.S. However, the heroic Vietnamese people, through their struggle, have shown that they will not be deceived by the cunning plots of the imperialists and their accomplices. The Vietnamese people understand that the revolutionary war is the only path to victory.

The article reaffirmed: The Albanian people, who regard the struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people as a sacred cause, have, are, and will continue to wholeheartedly support the just and heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people.

The Albanian Radio Station recently also issued a commentary pointing out: The iron grip of the indomitable people's war of the South Vietnamese people has tightly pinned down the U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam. Currently, the U.S. is making desperate struggles, attempting to find a way out through the dangerous policy of further escalating the war. The Pentagon in Washington has already announced the deployment of an additional 1,050 U.S. aggressor troops to South Vietnam to make up for recent heavy losses. While increasing troops to South Vietnam, the U.S. leaders also decided to extend the service term of U.S. troops and intensify the recruitment of cannon fodder. U.S. bandit planes continue to bomb the residential areas controlled by the liberation forces in South Vietnam, brutally massacring the elderly, women, and children. At the same time, the U.S. bandits are also intensifying their bombing of North Vietnam. All these barbaric acts clearly show that the U.S. aggressors, like a wounded beast, are making desperate struggles.

The commentary said: On the other hand, Johnson is mobilizing all his lackeys to peddle the "peace talks" deception. Recently, UN Secretary-General U Thant hurriedly traveled between New Delhi, Moscow, and London, plotting schemes to pressure the heroic Vietnamese people and lure them into the "peace talks" trap. U Thant's plans and proposals on the Vietnam issue all bear the "Made in America" label. Every time U.S. imperialism suffers a defeat in Vietnam, U Thant proposes the so-called "complete ceasefire" plan to create conditions for the U.S. aggressors to gain breathing room, allowing them to continue their savage aggression. U Thant also attempts to bring the Vietnam issue into the UN track, trying to force the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms, surrender to U.S. imperialism, and accept "peace talks" through U.S.-Soviet cooperation. All of U Thant's plots have been shamefully foiled by the Vietnamese people.

The commentary said: The heroic Vietnamese people will certainly defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory. Whether it is the escalation of aggression and Johnson's deception, or the betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists, they are all doomed to fail.

    阿《团结报》和电台欢呼南越人民抗美救国战争的辉煌胜利
    人民战争的威力无比强大
    苏修背叛越南人民为美帝侵略阴谋效劳注定要失败
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十一日发表文章，热烈欢呼英雄的越南南方军民最近在新春攻势中所取得的辉煌胜利，谴责美苏合伙推销“和谈”阴谋。
    文章说：越南南方军民最近发动的新攻势，使美国侵略者遭到了惨重的失败。南越军民勇敢和迅猛的进攻，再一次令人信服地和无可争辩地证明，人民战争强大的和无穷无尽的威力，证明英雄的越南人民早已掌握了战争的主动权，美国侵略者已没有力量抵抗这一伟大的人民战争。
    文章说：美帝国主义者在越南、老挝和泰国等地遭到接二连三的失败，使它们的反革命全球战略，受到致命的打击。
    文章揭露说：为了挽救美帝在越南不可避免的败局，包括苏修集团在内的所有美帝的同盟者都在紧张活动，为美帝推销“和谈”的破烂货。但是，英雄的越南人民以其斗争表明，他们决不会被帝国主义者及其帮凶的狡猾阴谋所欺骗。越南人民懂得，革命战争的道路是赢得胜利的唯一道路。
    文章重申：把兄弟的越南人民的斗争事业视作神圣事业的阿尔巴尼亚人民，过去、现在和将来都毫无保留地支持越南人民的正义的和英勇的斗争。
    地拉那电台最近也发表评论指出：越南南方人民坚不可摧的人民战争的铁钳已经把美国侵略者紧紧地钳在越南南方。目前，美帝正在作垂死的挣扎，妄图从进一步升级战争的危险政策中找到出路。华盛顿五角大楼已经宣布要增派一万零五百名美国侵略军到越南南方充当炮灰，以弥补最近的惨重损失。美帝头子在向越南南方增兵的同时，还作出延长美军兵役期和加紧搜罗炮灰的决定。美国强盗飞机对解放武装力量控制的越南南方城市的居民区不断进行轰炸，惨无人道地残杀老人、妇女和儿童。与此同时，美国强盗还加紧对越南北方的轰炸。这一切野蛮的行径清楚地表明，美国侵略者象一只受伤的野兽一样正在进行垂死的挣扎。
    地拉那电台的评论说：另一方面，约翰逊正在动员它的所有奴仆，兜售“和谈”骗局。最近，联合国秘书长吴丹匆忙奔走于新德里、莫斯科和伦敦之间，策划阴谋，企图对英雄的越南人民施加压力，诱使越南人民陷入“和谈”的圈套。吴丹关于越南问题的一切计划和建议都是带有“美国制造”的印记的。每当美帝国主义在越南遭到失败的时候，吴丹就提出所谓“全面停火”的计划，以便创造条件，使美国侵略者获得喘息时间，使它继续进行野蛮的侵略。吴丹还企图把越南问题纳入联合国轨道，想通过美苏合作，迫使越南人民放下武器，向美帝国主义屈服，接受“和谈”。吴丹的一切阴谋在越南人民面前遭到了可耻的破产。
    评论说：英雄的越南人民，必将战胜美国侵略者，取得最后胜利。无论是侵略升级和约翰逊的欺骗，或者是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者背信弃义的叛卖，都是注定要失败的。
