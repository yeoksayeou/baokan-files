The red flag of Jinggangshan flies high, the revolutionary road of Jinggangshan shines across the world. The great leader Chairman Mao personally cares for the people of Jinggangshan and approves the renaming of Jianxi Jian'an Prefecture to Jinggangshan Prefecture.

New China News Agency, Nanchang, February 11 - Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group have approved the enthusiastic request of the proletarian revolutionary factions, the broad revolutionary masses, and all the soldiers and officers of the stationed troops in the Jian'an region to rename the Jian'an Prefecture, where the first red base area of the Chinese revolution, Jinggangshan, is located, to Jinggangshan Prefecture. Under the personal care and great encouragement of Chairman Mao, the Revolutionary Committee of Jinggangshan Prefecture was born in victory on February 5. The people and soldiers of Jinggangshan region and all over Jiangxi Province held grand meetings to enthusiastically celebrate Chairman Mao's personal care for the people of Jinggangshan and the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Forty years ago, the great leader Chairman Mao personally raised the revolutionary red flag on Jinggangshan, opening up the brilliant revolutionary road of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by force of arms. Now, the spark of Jinggangshan has become a raging inferno, and China has become the base area of the world revolution. The revolutionary red flag of Jinggangshan is flying all over the world, and the revolutionary road of Jinggangshan shines across the world.

The great Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured an entire generation of Jinggangshan, greatly inspiring and encouraging the heroic sons and daughters of Jinggangshan. Over the past year, they have held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly and unshakably implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fought unyieldingly and bravely, and won decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On February 5, the Revolutionary Committee of Jinggangshan Prefecture was solemnly established. Comrade Cheng Shiqing, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, attended the celebration meeting for the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Jinggangshan Prefecture and announced the decision of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to rename Jian'an Prefecture to Jinggangshan Prefecture. The five million revolutionary masses attending the meeting enthusiastically and for a long time shouted their highest praise for Chairman Mao's most affectionate care and greatest encouragement for the people of Jinggangshan. They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and sang, "The party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, the love of the father and mother is not as great as Chairman Mao's love!" over and over again.

Comrade Wang Shichang, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Jinggangshan Prefecture, spoke at the celebration meeting. He, on behalf of the people of Jinggangshan Prefecture, firmly declared that they would definitely hold higher the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a larger-scale mass movement of "promoting great loyalty and establishing great integrity," quickly and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and turn the Jinggangshan region into a red Mao Zedong Thought school, repaying Chairman Mao's affectionate care for the people of Jinggangshan with practical actions.
