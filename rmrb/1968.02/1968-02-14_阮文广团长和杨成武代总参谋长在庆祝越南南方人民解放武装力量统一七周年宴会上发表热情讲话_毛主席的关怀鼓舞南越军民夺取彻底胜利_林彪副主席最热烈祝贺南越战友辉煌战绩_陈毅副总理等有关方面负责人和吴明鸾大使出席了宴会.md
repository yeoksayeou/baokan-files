In the midst of the triumphant songs of the recent New Year victories of the South Vietnamese military and people, the permanent representative of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, hosted a banquet this evening to enthusiastically celebrate the 7th anniversary of the unification of the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Yang Chengwu, Vice Minister of National Defense Su Yu, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Wen Yuzheng, and Director of the General Logistics Department Qiu Huizu, as well as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Pengfei and other relevant officials, were invited to attend the banquet.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu and Deputy Chief of General Staff Yang Chengwu both delivered speeches at the banquet.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu said in his speech, "The liberation armed forces of South Vietnam have a very glorious history. Today, they have grown into a steel army that can defeat American imperialism. He went on to point out that at present, the military and people of South Vietnam have developed the people's war to a new level. In this people's war, every person is a soldier, every village is a fortress and a combat unit, making the enemy sink into the vast sea of the people's war. The recent victories of the South Vietnamese military and people prove that they have the ability to launch fierce, comprehensive, and sustained attacks. It also proves that their leadership, command, strategy, tactics, and technical levels have made a leap forward. At the same time, it also proves that the military and people of South Vietnam have enough strength to defeat the 120,000 American troops, puppet troops, and mercenaries of American imperialism invading South Vietnam.

He said, "As the beloved leader of 31 million Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh has said: 'The closer to victory, the more difficulties will arise.' The desperate enemy, before being completely defeated, will struggle more frantically and create many new difficulties for us. To live up to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's recent praise for the victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam, to respond to the call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 3, 1968, and to answer the concern and encouragement of our beloved Chairman Mao and the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the military and people of South Vietnam will unite more closely, advance with the momentum of an irresistible force, launch continuous attacks on the American puppet troops, overthrow the puppet regime, achieve a complete victory, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately unify the country.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, on behalf of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, expressed heartfelt thanks to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for their sincere, great, and resolute support for the struggle of the South Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation.

Deputy Chief of General Staff Yang Chengwu then delivered a speech at the banquet. He first, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the warmest congratulations to the comrades of the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam and to all the Vietnamese people.

Yang Chengwu pointed out that the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam are the children of the Vietnamese people. Over the past seven years, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, they have grown stronger and stronger in the fires of battle, constantly developing and expanding. He praised the heroic military and people of South Vietnam for fully unleashing the mighty power of the people's war, firmly grasping the initiative in the war, and fighting against more than 100,000 American puppet troops on 170,000 square kilometers of land, defeating them completely, and creating a miracle in the history of national liberation wars.

Yang Chengwu enthusiastically hailed the recent victories of the South Vietnamese military and people, who, with the momentum of an irresistible force, launched surprise attacks and achieved stunning results that shocked the world. He also praised the military and people of North Vietnam for, while fully supporting the struggle of their southern compatriots, fighting back against the air and sea attacks of American imperialism, achieving brilliant victories.

Yang Chengwu said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, wisely pointed out: 'Your victory once again shows that no matter how small a country is, as long as it fully mobilizes the people, firmly relies on the people, and wages a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated.' The great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, also pointed out: 'The closer to victory, the more difficulties will arise. The enemy is like a cornered beast that will struggle more frantically. Therefore, our military and people must strengthen unity, persist in the fight, fight hard, and fight continuously to achieve greater victories.' We are deeply convinced that persistence is victory, and the final victory will definitely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people.

Yang Chengwu said, "The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are stronger than ever before. We will provide even more powerful support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, and make our contributions to the revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the world.

Yang Chengwu pointed out, "China and Vietnam are neighboring countries connected by mountains and rivers. Our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. Your struggle is our struggle, and your victory is our victory. The people of our country and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army will forever be loyal to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and will be the strong backing of the Vietnamese people, resolutely supporting your just struggle until the complete defeat of the American aggressors and the achievement of the final victory in the great war of resistance against American aggression.

Ambassador Vu Minh Quan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also attended the banquet.

    新华社十三日讯　在越南南方军民新春大捷的凯歌声中，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广今晚举行宴会，热烈庆祝越南南方人民解放武装力量统一七周年。
    国务院副总理陈毅，中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武，国防部副部长粟裕，中国人民解放军副总参谋长温玉成和总后勤部部长邱会作，以及外交部副部长姬鹏飞等有关方面负责人，应邀出席了宴会。
    阮文广团长和杨成武代总参谋长在宴会上先后讲话。
    阮文广在讲话中说，越南南方人民解放武装力量有着极其光荣的历史。今天，它已经成长为一支战胜美帝国主义的钢铁军队。他接着指出，目前，越南南方军民已把人民战争发展到一个新的水平。在这场人民战争中，每一个人是一名战士，每一个村庄是一个堡垒和一个战斗小组，使敌人陷入了人民战争的汪洋大海之中。越南南方军民最近取得的胜利，证明他们有着猛烈的、全面的和持续的进攻能力，证明他们在领导、指挥、战略、战术和技术等方面的水平有了飞跃的成长，同时也证明，越南南方军民有足够的力量击败侵略越南南方的一百二十万美军、伪军和美帝国主义的仆从军。
    他说，正如三千一百万越南人民的敬爱领袖胡志明主席所说的那样：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。”绝望中的敌人在完全被打败以前，将会更疯狂地挣扎，将会给我们制造出许多新的困难。为了不辜负胡志明主席最近对越南南方人民所取得的胜利的表扬，为了响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六八年二月三日的号召，为了回答敬爱的毛主席和中国人民、中国人民解放军的关怀和鼓舞，越南南方军民将更紧密地团结起来，以排山倒海之势，乘胜前进，向美伪军发动接连的进攻，推翻伪政权，夺取彻底的胜利，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
    阮文广团长代表越南南方民族解放阵线，向毛主席、中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民对越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的真诚、巨大和坚决有力的支持，表示衷心的感谢。
    杨成武代总参谋长接着在宴会上讲话。他首先代表我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席，代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向兄弟的越南南方人民武装力量的战友们和全体越南人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    杨成武指出，越南南方人民解放武装力量，是越南人民的子弟兵。七年来，它在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，在战斗的烈火中越战越强，不断发展壮大。他赞扬英雄的越南南方军民，充分发挥人民战争的强大威力，牢牢地掌握了战争的主动权，在十七万平方公里的土地上抗击着一百多万美伪军，并且把它们打得落花流水，创造了世界民族解放战争史上的奇迹。
    杨成武热烈欢呼最近越南南方军民，以排山倒海之势，出奇制胜，发动袭击，取得了震惊世界的辉煌战果。他还赞扬越南北方军民在全力支持南方同胞斗争的同时，同美帝国主义的海空袭击进行了针锋相对的斗争，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    杨成武说，我们伟大领袖毛主席在给阮友寿主席的贺电中英明地指出：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”越南人民伟大的领袖胡志明主席也指出：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。因此，我们军民更要加强团结，坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利。”我们深信，坚持下去就是胜利，最后胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民。
    杨成武说，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，比过去任何时候都更加强大了。我们将更加有力地支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，支援各国人民的革命斗争，为越南人民和世界各国人民的革命事业作出自己的贡献。
    杨成武指出，中越两国是山水相连的亲密邻邦，我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。你们的斗争就是我们的斗争，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利。我国人民和人民解放军全体指战员，永远忠于我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，坚决支持你们的正义斗争，直到彻底打败美国侵略者，取得伟大抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾也出席了宴会。
