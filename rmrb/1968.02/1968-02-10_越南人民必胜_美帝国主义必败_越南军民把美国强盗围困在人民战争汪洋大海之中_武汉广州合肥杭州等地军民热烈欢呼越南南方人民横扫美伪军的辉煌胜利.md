With overwhelming force and thunderous might, the South Vietnamese military and civilians launched a swift and powerful offensive, annihilating over 50,000 enemy troops in just six days, leaving the American aggressors in disarray and panic, and achieving a stunning victory that shocked the world." They said, "We, the military and civilians of Wuhan, regard supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war as our unshakable internationalist duty. We will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and with practical actions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their anti-American national salvation war to the end."

A responsible comrade of the Vietnamese trainees in Hubei also spoke at the meeting.
