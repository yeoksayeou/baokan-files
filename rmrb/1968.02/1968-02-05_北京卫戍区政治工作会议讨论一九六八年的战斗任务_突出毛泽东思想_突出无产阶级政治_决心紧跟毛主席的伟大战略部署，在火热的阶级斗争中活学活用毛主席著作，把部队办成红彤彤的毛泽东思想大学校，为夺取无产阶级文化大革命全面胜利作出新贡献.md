In the year 1968, when the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to be won, how can the great tasks entrusted by Chairman Mao be accomplished brilliantly? Over 200 representatives attending the Beijing Garrison Political Work Conference unanimously agreed that in the new year, there are countless tasks to be done, but the key is to grasp the essence. This essence is to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, to emphasize proletarian politics, to carry out the revolutionization of people's thinking, and to ensure that all cadres and soldiers forever march forward along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

The Beijing Garrison Political Work Conference was held recently. During the conference, participants, in conjunction with their personal combat experiences and over a year of practice in the Cultural Revolution, extensively discussed the greatness and brilliance of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of most important and latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as the important instructions given by Vice Chairman Lin Biao during the Cultural Revolution, and the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They also summarized the work of the troops' ideological and political education over the past year. Attendees unanimously reflected that this was a rally to strengthen the revolutionary construction of the troops and to emphasize proletarian politics, and a mobilization meeting to further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and to win a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The cadres and soldiers resolutely declared that they would closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the essence, forever emphasize proletarian politics, turn the troops into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and make new contributions to winning a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison, who guard the side of the great leader Chairman Mao, have, under the affectionate care and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the great commander, Vice Commander Lin Biao, and the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fully carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and made great contributions in executing their defense missions and in the "three supports and two militaries." The broad cadres and soldiers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the fiery class struggle, they study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and fight a fierce battle of criticizing and repudiating revisionism. The revolutionization of the cadres' and soldiers' thinking has made a new leap, and the troops present a scene of unity, tension, seriousness, liveliness, and revolutionary fervor. This conference, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "Do not rely on past merits! Create new achievements," took Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and based on the current situation and the tasks of the new year, focused on discussing the issue of the revolutionary construction of the troops.

The conference believed that in the new year of winning a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the tasks of the People's Liberation Army are more arduous and more onerous. There are countless tasks to be done, and the key is to grasp the essence. This essence is to always emphasize the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to emphasize proletarian politics, to carry out the revolutionization of people's thinking, to use Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve all practical problems, to insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, to promote everything, to transform everything, and to overcome everything. Attendees pointed out that the People's Liberation Army is the great people's army created by the great leader Chairman Mao, and is the strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao has formulated a single correct political line for our army. We must always emphasize proletarian politics, use Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, and place ideological and political work in the first position in all work. This is the reliable guarantee for our army to forever march forward in the direction of revolutionization, and is the long-term plan for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years to ensure that our great socialist motherland will never change color.

How can the essence be grasped and proletarian politics be emphasized? Participants in the conference believed that the most important thing is to continue to deeply and extensively carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is a fundamental stance and worldview issue, and is the most important principle for revolutionaries. Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "What attitude to take towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important question. We must grasp the issue of the attitude towards Chairman Mao and towards Mao Zedong Thought." Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of our time. Chairman Mao's instructions are the lighthouse guiding us to advance bravely, and are the fundamental guidance for us to win all victories. By grasping the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, we can ensure that the broad cadres and soldiers are truly loyal to Chairman Mao with all their hearts, follow Chairman Mao closely without leaving his side, and in all work, act according to the instructions of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, ensuring that proletarian politics are always emphasized. In the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the broad cadres and soldiers must carry forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao himself, with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest speed, to implement Chairman Mao's instructions item by item and comprehensively in their actions, and strive to be models in studying, propagating, implementing, and executing Chairman Mao's instructions.

Attendees believed that to grasp the essence and emphasize proletarian politics, it is especially important to carry out the revolutionization of the thinking of the leading cadres. This is the key to ensuring that politics are emphasized in all work. The members of the leading cadres are the pioneers in emphasizing proletarian politics and carrying out the revolutionization of the troops. If the revolutionization of the thinking of the leading cadres is done well, it can be ensured that politics are emphasized in all work and that everything is guided by Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Fu Chongbi, Commander of the Beijing Garrison, spoke at the meeting, and Comrade Huang Zuozhen, Second Political Commissar, made a summary report.
