The spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought is sweeping across the land. Under the great banner of Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution and promote production," the Dazhai Brigade has launched a vigorous campaign for spring plowing preparations. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are determined to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and strive for a full-scale bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production this year.

The Dazhai Brigade's spring plowing preparations this year, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings of "not fighting unprepared battles and not fighting battles without assurance," have been carried out earlier and better than in previous years. By "earlier," we mean that ideological preparations and production work have started earlier; by "better," we mean higher ideological standards and better work quality. In the spring plowing preparations, the most crucial and fundamental preparation is to emphasize proletarian politics, conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and promote the ideological transformation of the people. Because in any work, it all starts with ideology. Where the ideology goes, the people follow. If the ideology does not progress, production will not progress either. Therefore, we insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the spring plowing preparations, grasp revolution, promote production, start early and do well, and make continuous progress.

Since the beginning of winter preparations, we have focused on people's ideology. The brigade has mobilized the masses to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, summarize the experiences of grasping revolution and promoting production in 1967, further recognize the current favorable situation, and determine this year's combat tasks. In the summary, we reached a common conclusion: following Chairman Mao is victory.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai and the revolutionary cadres of Xiyang County, in the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and always used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. They have directed their spears at the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi, launching a revolutionary criticism of this handful of capitalist roaders within the party. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have become more hateful of Chinese Khrushchev and the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line through criticism; the more they criticize Chinese Khrushchev, the more they feel close to Chairman Mao, the more they love Chairman Mao, the more they realize they cannot do without Chairman Mao's works, the more they study and apply Chairman Mao's works well; the more they criticize Chinese Khrushchev, the clearer their minds become, the brighter their eyes become, and the more energetic they feel. We do not engage in factionalism, anarchism, or splittism. Everyone's heart, words, and efforts are united. Therefore, last year, Dazhai saw significant improvements in political and ideological work and agricultural production. Xiyang County also achieved double victories in revolution and production.

In the midst of the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" has become even more deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Revolutionary masses from all over the country, with their class feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have flocked to Dazhai for visits and inspections. Each visit from domestic and foreign visitors has greatly inspired and encouraged us.

The situation is so good, with the whole country learning from Dazhai. What should Dazhai do? We say: the better the situation, the higher Chairman Mao's requirements for Dazhai, the higher the people's requirements for Dazhai. We should find our shortcomings, listen to Chairman Mao's words, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, and in 1968, achieve "discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress."

We should see that this year's spring plowing is being carried out under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Doing a good job in spring plowing production is directly related to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidating the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, supporting the socialist construction of the country, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Therefore, we broad masses of grassroots cadres in the countryside should listen to Chairman Mao's words, bravely "charge" to the front lines of spring plowing production, set an example for the community members, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and achieve new victories for the people. This is the key to doing a good job in the current spring plowing preparations.

Spring production is a very urgent combat task. The enthusiasm of the masses has risen. How cadres treat them, whether they can put "public" first, stand up, and lead the masses with enthusiasm to fight the spring plowing production battle, has become an important indicator of whether each cadre is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If you put "public" first, you can be bold, go to the masses, lead boldly, take responsibility actively, speak when you should, manage when you should, fear no hardship, avoid factionalism, and avoid anarchism; if you put "private" first, you will have many concerns, fear responsibility, lie down and do nothing, engage in factionalism, and fight for turf. I firmly believe that the vast majority of grassroots cadres in the countryside are revolutionary. Most of them come from poor peasant backgrounds and are deeply loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. They will surely stand up at this critical moment of spring plowing production and take revolution and production seriously.

The cadres of Dazhai listen to Chairman Mao's words and are deeply loyal to Chairman Mao. In the great storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have experienced great trials and seen much of the world. We have united with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the Cultural Revolution and have been greatly tempered and improved. Of course, our cadres have also made mistakes and errors in their long-term work, but no one has thought of changing jobs just because the masses have raised some criticisms; on the contrary, we regard the masses' criticisms and opinions as expressions of concern and love for the cadres, as a manifestation of high responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause. Everyone follows Chairman Mao's instructions, actively goes to the masses, humbly learns from the poor and lower-middle peasants, willingly becomes a student of the masses, listens to the masses' opinions, and improves their work. Therefore, the cadres of our brigade have only one heart: to serve the people wholeheartedly, to hold power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, to use power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life. As soon as the spring plowing preparations began, the cadres of the Dazhai Brigade united with the community members, always taking the lead. Ideological work must be done among the people, and production work must be done in the fields. When working, the cadres braved the cold wind, working with the community members to break stones, build stone dams, fertilize, and rush to carry heavy loads, actively taking on heavy tasks; when resting, the cadres and community members studied and applied Chairman Mao's works together, addressed active thoughts, criticized and transformed themselves, and together criticized Chinese Khrushchev. In the evenings, everyone gathered in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, discussing the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, sharing experiences of criticizing and transforming oneself, proposing higher requirements for each other, and further promoting ideological transformation. In short, we have truly achieved that where there are masses, there are cadres; where cadres go, they lead in learning, working, and laboring. The masses love and protect the cadres, and the cadres care for the masses. A new proletarian cadre-mass relationship has formed in Dazhai.

Chairman Mao said: "Whoever only sees the bright side and not the difficulties will not be able to fight well for the realization of the party's tasks." Although we have many favorable conditions for doing a good job in spring plowing production this year, we must also fully see the unfavorable and difficult aspects. In terms of climate and natural conditions in our region, this year is different from previous years. This year has an intercalary seventh month in the lunar calendar, and in terms of agricultural seasons, spring sowing should be one month earlier than in previous years; but last winter had heavy snow, and this spring has low soil temperatures, which contradicts early sowing. What should we do? We have learned from Chairman Mao's teachings and made sufficient ideological preparations. Chairman Mao said: "In strategy, we must despise all enemies; in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously. That is, we must despise them as a whole, but we must take them seriously in each specific problem." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we must vigorously promote scientific farming in production to ensure timely sowing and strong seedlings. Currently, we are improving the land, with each person building one mu of high-standard terraced fields to ensure bumper harvests in both drought and flood; we are fertilizing early and well, applying fertilizer scientifically, improving the soil, ensuring that each mu of land receives 120 baskets of high-quality fertilizer, with 80% already prepared; we are strengthening livestock feeding and management, repairing tools, and as soon as the land thaws, we will plow early, loosen the soil, expose it to sunlight, raise the soil temperature, facilitate sowing, and ensure full seedlings. At the same time, we will start drying and selecting seeds early, selecting high-quality seeds, and this year we will use high-quality seeds for all. Our soldiers are elite soldiers, and our weapons are good weapons. With strong soldiers and horses and boundless enthusiasm, we will definitely not miss the agricultural season, sow at the right time, and fight the spring plowing production battle well, laying a solid foundation for a full-scale bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production in 1968.

    狠抓革命，猛促春耕，再立新功
    陈永贵
    毛泽东思想的春风吹遍了大地。在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，我们大寨大队已经掀起了一个热火朝天的春季备耕工作的高潮。广大贫下中农和革命干部决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中，努力争取今年农林牧副的全面大丰收。
    我们大寨大队今年的备耕工作，按照毛主席的“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”的教导，抓得比过去那一年都早都好。说早，就是思想准备早，生产动手早；说好，就是思想上的高标准，工作上的高质量。在备耕工作中，千准备，万准备，突出无产阶级政治，办好毛泽东思想学习班，促进人的思想革命化，是最大的最根本的准备。因为干什么工作，都在一个思想。思想往哪里走，人就往哪里走。思想上不来，生产也上不来。所以，我们坚持用毛泽东思想统帅备耕，狠抓革命，猛促生产，抓早抓好，步步赶前。
    去冬备耕工作开始，我们就着重抓了人的思想。大队广泛发动群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，总结了一九六七年抓革命、促生产的经验，更加认清了当前大好形势，确定了今年的战斗任务。在总结中，我们得出的一个共同的结论是：紧跟毛主席就是胜利。
    我们大寨贫下中农和昔阳县的无产阶级革命派，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，始终以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，把矛头直接指向中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人，对这党内一小撮走资派开展了革命大批判。广大贫下中农越批越恨中国赫鲁晓夫，越恨资产阶级反动路线的流毒；越批中国赫鲁晓夫，越觉得毛主席他老人家亲，越是热爱毛主席，越认识毛主席著作离不了，越对毛主席著作学得紧，用得好；越批中国赫鲁晓夫，我们头脑越清醒，眼睛越亮堂，浑身都是劲。我们不闹派性，不闹无政府主义，不搞分裂，大家心往一处想，话往一处说，劲往一处使。所以，去年我们大寨政治思想大提高，农业生产大发展。昔阳县也取得了革命和生产双胜利。
    在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席关于“农业学大寨”的伟大号召更加深入人心，各地革命群众，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，纷纷来大寨参观访问。国内外参观访问的人每来一次，都给我们以很大的鼓舞和力量。
    形势这样好，全国学大寨，大寨怎么办？我们说：形势越是大好，毛主席他老人家对大寨的要求就越高，全国人民对大寨的要求就越高，我们就越应该找出差距，好好听毛主席的话，发扬不断革命精神，在一九六八年“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”。
    我们应当看到：今年的春耕，是在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下进行的。搞好春耕生产，直接关系到全面落实毛主席的最新指示，关系到巩固无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果，关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，关系到支援国家社会主义建设，巩固无产阶级专政，关系到支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争和支援世界人民的革命斗争。因此，我们广大农村基层干部要听毛主席的话，勇敢地“杀”上春耕生产第一线，给社员做榜样，挑起革命和生产两副重担，为人民立新功。这是搞好当前备耕工作的关键。
    春季生产是一项十分紧迫的战斗任务。群众劲头起来啦，干部如何对待他们，能不能“公”字当头，挺身而出，满腔热情地站在群众的前头，组织群众，领导群众打好春耕生产这一仗，就成为衡量每一个干部是不是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。你是“公”字挂帅，就能“敢”字当头，到群众中去，大胆领导，积极负责，该讲的就讲，该管的就管，不怕吃苦，不搞派性，不搞无政府主义；你是“私”字当头，就会顾虑重重，怕负责任，躺倒不干，搞派性，争山头。我完全相信，绝大多数农村基层干部，都是要革命的。他们大多数都是出身贫下中农，对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，一定会在当前春耕生产的关键时刻，挺身而出，把革命和生产认真地抓起来。
    我们大寨的干部最听毛主席的话，无限忠于毛主席，在这次无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，经过很大的风雨，见过很大的世面。我们和贫下中农团结在一起，在文化大革命中得到了很大的锻炼和提高。当然，我们的干部在长期的工作中也有缺点和错误，可是没有一个人因为群众提了点意见，就想换班，不愿当干部；相反，我们把群众的批评和意见，看作是对干部的关心和爱护，是对无产阶级革命事业高度负责的表现。大家遵照毛主席的指示，主动到群众中去，虚心拜贫下中农为师，甘当群众的小学生，听取群众的意见，改进自己的工作。所以，我们大队的干部只有一个心眼：完全彻底为人民服务，为贫下中农掌好权，用好权，永远跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。备耕工作一开始，我们大寨大队的干部就和社员群众拧成一股绳，处处走在前面。思想工作要见人，生产工作要到地。劳动的时候，干部冒着寒风，和社员一起打石头，垒石坝，积肥沤肥，抢着挑重担子，主动找重活干；休息的时候，干部和社员一起活学活用毛主席著作，抓活思想，破私立公，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫。晚上，大家一起在毛泽东思想学习班里，共同畅谈文化大革命的大好形势，畅谈斗私批修的体会，互相提出更高的要求，进一步促进思想革命化。总之，真正做到了那里有群众，那里就有干部；干部到那里，就在那里带头学习、工作和劳动。群众爱护干部，干部关心群众，一个崭新的无产阶级的干群关系已经在大寨形成。
    毛主席说：“谁要是只看见光明一面，不看见困难一面，谁就会不能很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”我们搞好今年春耕生产的有利条件固然很多，但是还必须充分看到不利的一面，困难的一面。以我们这个地区的气候和自然条件来说，今年和往年不一样，今年农历闰七月，按农事季节讲，春播下种要比往年提前一个月；可是去年冬天雪大，今春地温低，和早下种有矛盾。怎么办？我们学习了毛主席的教导，作好了足够的思想准备。毛主席说：“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。也就是说在整体上我们一定要藐视它，在一个一个的具体问题上我们一定要重视它。”遵照毛主席的这一教导，我们在生产上必须大抓科学种田，保证适时播种，苗全苗旺。目前，我们正在整修土地，每人要搞一亩高标准的水平梯田，旱涝保丰收；早沤肥，沤好肥，科学施肥，改良土壤，今年每亩地保证施到一百二十担优质肥料，现在百分之八十已经准备好；加强牲畜饲养管理，整修农具，土地解冻后及早翻地，疏松土壤，接触阳光，提高地温，有利播种，保证全苗。同时要提早翻晒种籽，精选良种，今年要全部使用优良品种。我们的兵是精兵，武器是好武器，兵强马壮，干劲冲天，就一定能够不违农时，适时下种，打好春耕生产这一仗，为一九六八年的农林牧副全面大丰收打下坚实的基础。
