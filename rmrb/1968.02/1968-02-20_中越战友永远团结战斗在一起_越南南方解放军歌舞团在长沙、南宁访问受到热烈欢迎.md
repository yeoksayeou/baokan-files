The Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe of South Vietnam, led by Director Nguyen Van Hung, arrived in Nanning, Guangxi by train this afternoon.

More than 500 military and civilian personnel of Nanning City enthusiastically welcomed the artists from South Vietnam. They held up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, and beat drums and gongs. When Director Nguyen Van Hung and the entire troupe stepped out of the train, members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Preparatory Group, military leaders such as Jiao Hongguang, and leaders of the Guangxi Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, such as Liu Chonggui, went forward to shake hands with them. Soldiers of the Guangxi Military Region Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team pinned golden Mao badges on the chests of their Vietnamese comrades. The crowd continuously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho!"

In the evening, the Guangxi Military Region held a banquet to warmly welcome the entire troupe. Guangxi Military Region leader Liu Chonggui and Director Nguyen Van Hung spoke at the banquet. Liu Chonggui said, "The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to be the strong rear guard for the Vietnamese military and people. In the face of the unbreakable fighting unity of our two peoples, any military adventure and political deception by U.S. imperialism is doomed to failure. Victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people."

Director Nguyen Van Hung said, "We are very happy to have come to Guangxi, which is connected with our homeland by mountains and rivers. Through this visit and performance in various places in China, we have deeply felt that the vast territory of China and the 700 million Chinese people are indeed the strongest rear guard and reliable base for our struggle to resist the Americans and save the nation. On behalf of the people of South Vietnam, I express my heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people for their assistance!"

The deputy consul of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Consulate General in Nanning, Le Quang Dan, and the director of the Vietnamese internship group in Guangxi, Phan Dao, also went to the station to welcome the Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe of South Vietnam and attended the welcome banquet.

At noon today, the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Hunan held a banquet to warmly entertain the entire troupe of the Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe of South Vietnam.
