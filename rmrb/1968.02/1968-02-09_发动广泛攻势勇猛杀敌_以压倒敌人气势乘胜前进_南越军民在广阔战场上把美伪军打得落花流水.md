The heroic Vietnamese people in the South, with their resounding victories and miraculous feats, have continued to advance with heroic strides and boundless aspirations, fighting with unyielding spirit on the vast battlefield of South Vietnam. They fear neither fatigue, hardship, nor sacrifice, fighting continuously to overwhelm the enemy with a relentless offensive, sweeping through towns and strongholds, and defeating the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, leaving them disoriented and in disarray.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces Continue to Be Active in West Saigon

The people's liberation forces, with the strong support and close cooperation of the patriotic people, have continued to launch extensive attacks on the enemy's important military and political institutions and the stationed U.S. and puppet forces in the city and suburbs of West Saigon on the 6th, 7th, and 8th. The people's liberation forces fought with great mobility and unpredictability, leaving the enemy unable to respond. Western news agencies lamented, "West Saigon has completely fallen into a state of paralysis," and the puppet government's situation is "extremely dire." By the 7th, the people's liberation forces continued to be active in seven out of the nine districts of West Saigon and controlled most of the adjacent Thu Duc district. In the early hours of the 7th, the people's liberation forces and patriotic people simultaneously attacked eleven enemy strongholds, including police stations in the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th districts. These fierce assaults were well-coordinated. Many police stations have been captured, and some enemy troops fled in panic at the sound of the advancing liberation forces. Many stubborn enemies of the people within the puppet government's institutions were dragged out of their hiding places by the patriotic people and received the punishment they deserved. The American invaders hiding in various strongholds also suffered heavy blows from the liberation forces and patriotic people. The liberation forces continuously attacked the Tan Son Nhut Airport and the U.S. troops stationed at the West Saigon racetrack, destroying many enemy planes and military equipment, and annihilating many U.S. troops. In just one attack on February 3rd, the people's liberation forces and patriotic people destroyed fifty enemy planes and a munitions depot within the airport. The American invaders were terrified, hiding in their strongholds, not daring to move, but still enduring heavy losses.

In the areas of West Saigon-Thu Duc controlled by the people's liberation forces, a vibrant scene unfolds. The people, with excited and joyful hearts, welcome the liberation forces, spreading the news, "They have returned! They have returned!" Many liberation force soldiers and workers went deep into the workers' districts to propagate among the people. They also opened the granaries of the puppet government and the warehouses of the U.S. military, distributing the stored food and supplies to the people, bringing new joy to the people who have been suffering under the U.S. puppet iron hoofs. In the Thu Duc district, new people's courts have been established, and the people have judged and severely punished some of the most heinous puppet government criminals, to the great satisfaction of the people.

After Nine Days and Nights of Fierce Battle, the Glorious Red and Blue Flag with the Golden Star Still Proudly Flies Over Hue

In Hue, the glorious red and blue flag with the golden star of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam still proudly waves in the wind. After nine days and nights of fierce street battles, most of this important city remains under the control of the people's liberation forces and patriotic people. The people's liberation forces and patriotic people have inflicted heavy blows on the frantically counterattacking U.S. and puppet forces, making them pay a heavy price for every step they try to advance, rendering them a disorganized and defeated force. The United Press International revealed that the U.S. "advisors" in the puppet army were extremely "frustrated" due to the lack of troops. A large number of American draftees suffered humiliating defeats from the iron fists of the people. The streets and buildings of Hue are littered with the corpses of U.S. and puppet troops. The Hue Airport is strewn with the charred remains of enemy planes. A convoy of fourteen supply trucks of the puppet army was decimated, leaving only one truck. The liberation forces and patriotic people blew up the road bridge from the U.S. base in Phu Bai to Hue and the large bridge over the Perfume River connecting the north and south of Hue, cutting off Hue's communication with the outside world and encircling the remaining isolated enemy troops.

Accompanied by the victorious gunfire in Saigon and Hue, the people's liberation forces in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region launched a fierce offensive at dawn on the 7th, swiftly breaking through the U.S. invaders' defenses on Highway 9 and capturing the strategically important stronghold of Vinh Loc. In the battle for Vinh Loc, the liberation forces bravely charged into the enemy's defensive positions, engaging in fierce close combat, destroying one fortification after another, and annihilating large numbers of defending enemies.

Currently, the people's liberation forces are expanding their victories and eliminating the remaining enemy forces. While attacking Vinh Loc, the liberation forces also launched extremely fierce artillery attacks on the U.S. military airport and Hill 861 in Khe Sanh, and blocked the roads leading to Vinh Loc, preventing the enemy from sending reinforcements by helicopter or land. The tens of thousands of U.S. troops besieged in the Khe Sanh base and its surroundings are now like trapped rats, unable to move forward or backward.

The Liberation Forces Launch Extensive Attacks with Overwhelming Momentum in the Central and Southern Battlefields

On the battlefields of the Central Highlands, the South, and the Mekong Delta, the people's liberation forces continue to launch extensive attacks with overwhelming momentum, and reports of victories are frequent.

In the Central Highlands, in addition to striking the enemy in Hue and Khe Sanh, the liberation forces also launched a series of attacks and bombardments on the U.S. invaders' base in Da Nang, and once again attacked the enemy troops in the provincial capital of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai. On the 8th, the liberation forces entered Da Lat, one of the six largest cities in South Vietnam, destroying a U.S. military barracks, storming the Da Lat City Hall, and occupying the central market. On the 6th and 7th, the liberation forces successively bombarded the base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division in An Khe and the base of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division in Pleiku, killing and wounding many U.S. invaders, and destroying and damaging many planes and military vehicles.

In the South, the provincial capital of Tay Ninh, west-northwest of Saigon, also began to be attacked on the 7th. The positions of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and the U.S. 25th Division in Bien Hoa were also subjected to heavy artillery fire from the liberation forces, suffering heavy losses. In the Mekong Delta, in the provincial capitals of My Tho, Go Cong, and Can Tho in the provinces of My Tho, Go Cong, and Can Tho, the liberation forces continued to launch powerful offensives against the enemy on the 7th, achieving brilliant results.

In various towns and their surrounding areas, more and more people from all walks of life and various patriotic forces have risen up to join the great struggle against the Americans and to save the nation. In the Saigon-Thu Duc area, in many large cities such as Ban Me Thuot, Nha Trang, and Qui Nhon, thousands of people took to the streets, holding massive demonstrations against the United States and the traitorous puppet government of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, making the enemy even more passive in both military and political terms, and plunging them into deeper crises.

    发动广泛攻势勇猛杀敌  以压倒敌人气势乘胜前进
    南越军民在广阔战场上把美伪军打得落花流水
    据新华社河内八日电　以辉煌的胜利和神奇的战功震动了全球的越南南方军民，这几天来，继续以英雄的步伐，满怀壮志，斗志昂扬地奔驰在广阔的南越战场上，冲锋陷阵。他们不怕疲劳，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，连续作战，以压倒敌人的气势乘胜前进，横扫城镇和据点里的敌人，把美帝国主义和它的走狗打得落花流水，不知所措。
          人民解放武装力量继续活跃在西贡
    大部地区，杀得敌人胆战心惊
    在美伪的老巢西贡，人民解放武装力量在爱国军民的大力支持和密切配合下，六日、七日、八日，继续在市区和郊区向敌人的重要军政机构和驻守的美伪军发动广泛的进攻。人民解放武装力量打得非常机动灵活，变化莫测，使得敌人无法应付。西方通讯社哀叹：“西贡已完全陷于瘫痪状态”，伪政权的处境“十分窘迫”。到七日为止，人民解放武装力量继续活跃在西贡市全部九个区中的七个区，并控制了紧邻西贡的堤岸区的大部地区。七日凌晨，人民解放武装力量和爱国军民同时向第五、第六、第七、第八区的伪警察所等十一个敌军据点，同时发动进攻。这些猛烈的袭击，都配合得很密切、协调。许多伪警察所已被占领，一些敌军在听到解放武装力量进攻的枪声时，仓惶抱头逃命。伪政权机构中许多顽固与人民为敌的坏家伙，被爱国军民一一从他们隐藏的处所里揪出来，遭到了应得的惩罚。龟缩在各个据点中的美国侵略军，也遭到了解放武装力量和爱国军民的沉重打击。解放武装力量接连不断地进攻西贡新山一机场和驻守西贡跑马场的美军，摧毁许多敌机和军事设备，歼灭了许多美军。仅在二月三日的一次进攻中，人民解放武装力量和爱国军民就击毁敌机五十架，摧毁机场内弹药库一座。美国侵略军被打得胆战心惊，躲在据点里，一步也不敢移动，但是仍然免不了挨打。
        解放武装力量控制下的西贡—堤岸
    街区一片热气腾腾景象
    在人民解放武装力量控制了的西贡—堤岸街区内，处处呈现出一片热气腾腾的景象。人民以兴奋激动的心情，欢迎人民解放武装力量，互相奔走相告：“他们回来了！他们回来了！”许多解放武装力量战士和工作人员，深入到各个工人区向群众进行宣传，他们还把伪政权的粮仓和美军仓库打开，把里面储存的粮食和物资分给人民，为辗转在美伪铁蹄下的人民带来了新的喜悦。在堤岸区，新的人民法庭成立了，人民审判和严厉惩处了一些罪大恶极的伪政权恶棍，大快人心。
        激战九天九夜，光荣的金星红蓝旗
    仍然骄傲地飘扬在顺化上空
    在顺化，越南南方民族解放阵线光荣的金星红蓝旗，仍然骄傲地在它的上空迎风招展。经过九天九夜的激烈巷战，这座重要城市的大部分地区仍然控制在人民解放武装力量和爱国军民的手中。人民解放武装力量和爱国军民给予疯狂反扑的美伪军以十分沉重的打击，使他们每妄图前进一步都付出了极其惨重的代价，业已溃不成军。合众国际社透露，伪军中的美国“顾问”由于手头没有军队感到非常“恼火”。大批美国少爷兵受到人民铁拳的痛击，遭到了可耻的下场。在顺化市内的街道上和建筑物周围，到处布满美伪军的尸体。
    顺化机场上遍地都是东歪西倒的烧焦了的敌机残骸。一支由十四辆输送车组成的伪军部队，被打得落花流水，只剩下了一辆车。解放武装力量和爱国军民炸毁了从美军芙拜基地通往顺化的公路桥和连接顺化南北两部的香水河大桥，切断了顺化与外界的交通，正在围歼已经陷于十分孤立的残余敌军。
          解放军在溪星地区发动猛烈攻势，
    占领重要战略据点
    伴随着西贡、顺化胜利的歼敌枪炮声，人民解放武装力量在广治—承天地区的溪星战场，七日凌晨以迅雷不及掩耳之势，突破了美国侵略军在九号公路的防线，占领了具有重要战略意义的据点——卫村。在进攻卫村的战斗中，解放武装力量英勇地冲入敌军防御阵地，和敌人展开激烈的近战，摧毁了一个个的工事，歼灭大批守敌。
    目前人民解放武装力量正在扩大战果，扫清残余敌军。在攻打卫村的同时，人民解放武装力量还以极其猛烈的炮火，轰击溪星美军机场和八六一高地，并封锁了通往卫村的公路，使敌人既无法用直升飞机，也无法从陆路向卫村增派援军。被围困在溪星基地及其周围的数以万计的美军，目前有如瓮中之鳖，进退维谷。
          解放武装力量以磅礴气势在中部中
    区、南部等战场发动广泛进攻
    在中部中区、南部和湄公河三角洲的各个战场上，人民解放武装力量继续以磅礴的气势，向敌人发动广泛的进攻，胜利的捷报频传。
    在中部中区，人民解放武装力量除了在顺化、溪星痛击敌人外，还向美国侵略军的岘港基地，连续发动一系列的进攻和炮轰，并且再次向广南省省会会安市内的敌军发起攻击。八日，攻进南越六大城市之一的大叻市人民解放武装力量击毁了一座美军宿舍，冲进了大叻市政厅，并占领了大叻市中心商场；六日和七日，解放武装力量先后炮轰了美国第一骑兵师在安溪的基地和美国第四步兵师在波来古的基地，打死打伤许多美国侵略军，击毁击伤许多飞机和军车。
    在南部，位于西贡西北的西宁省省会西宁市，也在七日开始遭到袭击。边和美国第一○一空降师和古芝美国第二十五师的阵地，也遭到解放武装力量的猛烈炮击，损失惨重。在湄公河三角洲的美萩、鹅贡、芹苴等省的省会美萩市、鹅贡市和芹苴市内，解放武装力量七日继续向敌人展开强大攻势，获得了辉煌的战果。
    在各个城镇及其周围地区，越来越多的各阶层人民和各种爱国力量纷纷奋起，投入抗美救国的伟大斗争。在西贡—堤岸地区，在邦美蜀、芽庄和归仁等许多大城市，数以千计的人民，涌上街头，举行反对美国和阮文绍—阮高其卖国傀儡政权的大示威，使敌人在军事上和政治上更加被动，陷入了更深重的危机。
