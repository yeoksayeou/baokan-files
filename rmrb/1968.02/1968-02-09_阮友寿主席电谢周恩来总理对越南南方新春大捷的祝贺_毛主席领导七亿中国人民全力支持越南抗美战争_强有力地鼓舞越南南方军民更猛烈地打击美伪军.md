New China News Agency, February 8th: Premier Zhou Enlai received a cable from Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, on February 4th. The cable expressed gratitude for the Premier's recent congratulations on behalf of the Chinese people and government for the brilliant victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam since the Spring Festival. The full text of the cable is as follows:

	To Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,

	Dear Premier,

	On behalf of the people of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, I express our heartfelt thanks for the Premier's warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese people and government for the brilliant victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam since the Spring Festival. We also deeply appreciate the assurance of the strong support of 700 million Chinese people for our struggle against American imperialism.

	The high-level combat camaraderie expressed in the Premier's congratulatory message has greatly mobilized and inspired our military and people to press forward, continue to deliver relentless and powerful blows to the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, and strive for a complete victory.

	We are deeply aware that in their dying moments, the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys will make desperate struggles and fiercely resist, committing more crimes against the people of South Vietnam. However, no matter how brutal and stubborn they are, they cannot escape their doom.

	On this occasion, I would like to express the deep gratitude of the military and people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese government, and the fraternal Chinese people for their wholehearted support and assistance in our struggle against American imperialism.

	I hereby express my highest respect to the Premier.

	Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam
	Nguyen Huu Tho

	February 4, 1968, in South Vietnam

    我代表越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会，对于总理代表中国人民和中国政府热烈祝贺越南南方军民新春的辉煌胜利，并重申七亿中国人民强有力地支持我们的抗美救国事业的保证，表示衷心的感谢。

  值此机会，我谨向全心全力地支持和帮助我们的抗美救国战争的以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党、中国政府和兄弟的中国人民表达越南南方军民和越南南方民族解放阵线的深切感谢。
