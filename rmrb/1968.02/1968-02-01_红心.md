One day, a few sacks of rice brought back by a certain platoon had been soaked by seawater. Local commune members discovered this while helping to unload the rice. They knew that rice soaked by seawater would become sour and smelly if left overnight. If made into rice immediately, it would taste somewhat bitter, but it would not go to waste. The militia squad leader and Red Guard leader, Li Shuiquan, thought to himself: The People's Liberation Army is on duty day and night, defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We cannot let them eat this seawater-soaked rice. After he shared his thoughts with everyone, the onlookers also discussed among themselves, deciding to replace these wet sacks of rice so that the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village could share them. The soldiers who transported the rice heard about this and hurried to stop them, but no matter how much they explained, they could not shake the resolve of the entire village to love the soldiers. Everyone had only one thing to say: "No matter what, we have to replace these sacks of rice."

The news of replacing the rice spread throughout the village, and the masses came to exchange, a few pounds here and a few pounds there.

The soldiers, moved, said: "The masses have taken away the wet rice and sent us a heart that loves the people's army. We too must care for the masses as the masses care for us."

   红心
   有一天，某连运回的大米有几包被海水打湿了，当地社员在帮助卸米时发现了这件事。他们知道，被海水浸湿的米，隔一夜就会酸臭；如果马上做成饭，吃起来虽然有些苦涩，但还不致造成浪费。民兵班长、红卫兵负责人李水泉心里想：解放军日夜值勤，保卫祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，决不能让他们吃这海水浸过的米。当他把自己的心事告诉大家后，在场的群众也你一言我一语地商量着，要把这些湿米换掉，让村里贫下中农分摊着吃。运米的战士知道这事后，急忙劝阻，但是不管怎么解释，也动摇不了全村群众热爱子弟兵的决心。大伙只有一句话：“说什么也要把这些米换掉。”
    换米的事在村里传开了，群众挨家挨户你几斤我几斤地赶来换。
    战士们感动地说：“群众换去了湿米，送来了一颗热爱人民军队的红心。我们也要象群众关心我们那样关心群众”。
