The U.S. and British imperialists have recently rallied the remnants of the British-backed puppet regime of the "Federation of South Arabia" to carry out armed disturbances in the Behan region in the northwest of South Yemen. Over the past few years, the U.S. and British imperialists have continuously supported the overthrown royalist forces of Yemen through the reactionary forces of Saudi Arabia, along with mercenaries, to carry out armed subversive activities against the Yemen Arab Republic. The people of South Yemen and Yemen have resolutely condemned these imperialist plots of aggression and have risen up to counterattack.

According to a report by the Middle East News Agency, the armed forces of South Yemen and Yemen have jointly launched defensive offensives against the mercenaries and infiltrators, and have cleared the Weshia mountain area between South Yemen and Yemen. A statement issued by the National Security Council of South Yemen on the 18th said: The armed forces of South Yemen have launched attacks in the Behan and Ozaali regions adjacent to the Yemen Arab Republic. The South Yemen forces pursued the infiltrators into the rebel areas of Yemen, where the Yemen forces joined the South Yemen forces in joint operations. According to a broadcast by the Sana'a radio station on the 18th, the armed forces of Yemen and South Yemen are jointly counterattacking the mercenaries and infiltrators in the Maswara area of the Beda province on the Yemen border.

The statement issued by the National Security Council of South Yemen also said that this joint offensive began on February 13th. In the battle, the enemy suffered heavy losses, with a large number of mercenaries killed, wounded, and captured. The armed forces of South Yemen also seized a large amount of weapons, ammunition, gold, and important documents. The statement also expressed that the South Yemen government is prepared to help their Yemeni brothers deal with the imperialist plots.

    据新华社二十四日讯  最近，美、英帝国主义纠集英帝国主义扶植的前南也门傀儡政权“南阿拉伯联邦”的残余势力，在南也门西北部贝汉地区进行武装骚乱。美、英帝国主义几年来还不断通过沙特阿拉伯反动势力，支持被推翻的也门王室势力伙同雇佣军，对阿拉伯也门共和国进行武装颠覆活动。南也门和也门人民坚决谴责美、英帝国主义的这些侵略阴谋，并奋起反击。
    据中东通讯社报道，南也门的武装部队同也门的武装部队，对雇佣军和渗入者联合发动了防御性进攻，并清剿了南也门和也门之间的韦希亚山区。南也门国家安全委员会十八日发表的一项声明说：南也门武装部队在阿拉伯也门共和国毗邻的贝汉和奥扎利两个地区进行攻击。南也门部队把渗入者追击到也门的叛乱地区。在那里，也门部队同南也门部队进行联合作战。据也门萨那电台十八日广播，也门和南也门的武装部队正在也门边境的贝达省的马斯瓦拉地区共同反击雇佣军和渗入者。
    南也门国家安全委员会发表的声明还说，这次联合进攻是从二月十三日开始的。在战斗中，敌人损失惨重，大量雇佣军被打死、打伤和逮捕。南也门武装部队还缴获了大量武器弹药、黄金和重要文件。声明还表示，南也门政府准备帮助他们的也门兄弟对付帝国主义阴谋。
