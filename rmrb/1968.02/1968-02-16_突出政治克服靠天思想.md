The saying goes, "A year's plan starts in spring." How can we build on last year's harvest and strike the first blow for this spring's agricultural production? Most of the members of our brigade believe that the lack of snow last winter and the dryness of the land are obstacles to timely spring sowing. We should carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. While focusing on fertilizing and plowing, we should use all available tools and water sources to launch anti-drought activities and ensure timely spring sowing.

However, some members have the idea of relying on heaven, thinking that this way of doing things requires a lot of manpower. Since there is still some time before sowing, they suggest waiting for rain or snow and then sowing, which would not delay things by many days.

In response to these thoughts, the brigade organized the members to study Chairman Mao's works, such as "Abolish Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" and "The Present Situation and Our Tasks." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Advantage without preparation is not a real advantage, nor does it have initiative. 'Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles without assurance. Every battle should strive to be prepared, and strive to have the assurance of victory in the comparison of enemy and self conditions.'"

Chairman Mao's teachings have overcome the idea of relying on heaven and waiting for rain among some members. Everyone unanimously agreed to carry forward the spirit of continuous fighting, abandon illusions, prepare for struggle, and achieve timely sowing even in drought and full seedling emergence without rain. Building on last year's harvest, we will strive for an even greater harvest this year. With unified thinking, the arrangements for various spring sowing tasks were quickly implemented.

    突出政治克服靠天思想
    “一年之计在于春”。如何在去年丰收的基础上，打响今年春耕生产第一炮呢？我们大队的大部分社员认为，去冬少雪，地有些干旱，是适时春播的障碍，应该发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，在搞好送肥、整地的同时，利用一切可以利用的工具和水源，开展抗旱活动，保证适时春播。但是，有些社员有靠天的想法，他们认为这样干，要费很多的劳动力，现在离种地还有一段时间，等下了雨雪再种，也误不了几天。
    针对这种活思想，大队组织社员们学习了毛主席的《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》、《目前形势和我们的任务》等著作。毛主席教导我们：“优势而无准备，不是真正的优势，也没有主动。”“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗，每战都应力求有准备，力求在敌我条件对比下有胜利的把握。”毛主席的教导，克服了部分社员中靠天等雨的思想。大家一致认为要发扬连续作战的作风，丢掉幻想，准备斗争，做到天旱保播种，无雨保全苗，在去年丰收的基础上，夺取今年更大的丰收。思想统一了，各项春播工作的安排也就很快落实了。
