The Red Guard Congress in Shijiazhuang has moved its administrative offices from a large building in the city center to a simple school building. The number of staff has been reduced from sixty-three to seventeen. The work style has become more hardworking and frugal, and more closely connected to the masses. This is a noteworthy new development.

A major task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to reform bureaucratic work and administrative management, and to reform all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base. The fundamental principle of revolutionizing bureaucratic work is to maintain close ties with the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us that Communist Party members must never separate themselves from the masses, must never stand above the masses, acting like officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, deeply integrating with the masses, and uniting with them. Our country is a socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat. All levels of our leadership organs represent the interests of the people and serve the people. All our workers must deeply root themselves among the masses and never separate from them. Only in this way can we constantly hear the voices of the masses, accept their supervision, and gather their opinions, wisdom, and experiences to carry forward. Only in this way can we always maintain the character of the working people, resist the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie, and build a strong defense against revisionism and bureaucratism in our minds.

In the past, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, created a bloated and cumbersome bureaucracy. They were full of officialdom, had too many people doing too little work, and were showy and extravagant. As a result, some leading organs became seriously detached from the masses, and some cadres became officials lording it over the people. Shouldn't this lesson be seriously learned?

The comrades of the Shijiazhuang Red Guard Congress said well: Bureaucratization leads to being high above the masses and detached from them; it fosters officialdom, issuing orders, and chaotic command; it detaches from the fiery class struggle; it wastes manpower and resources, and is not conducive to frugality and revolution; it creates a breeding ground for revisionism and is not conducive to ideological revolutionization. After the proletarian revolutionaries take power, they should maintain and carry forward the glorious traditions of our Party and Army, and like the revolutionary youngsters of the Shijiazhuang Red Guard Congress, stay closely with the masses, and establish a hardworking and frugal revolutionary style.

Realizing the revolutionization of bureaucratic work is a serious class struggle. Besides the corruption of bourgeois ideology, the old habits and forces in society are also a significant obstacle. We must take class struggle as the key link, thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the counterrevolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev, with high revolutionary consciousness, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the bourgeois "self," and establish the proletarian "public." We must thoroughly criticize and repudiate bureaucratization, and establish the revolutionary style of the proletariat, turning all levels of our leading organs into vigorous and battle-ready command centers that serve the people wholeheartedly.

    不搞机关化　扎根群众中
    本报评论员
    石家庄红代会，把办事机构从一个地处闹市的大楼，搬到一所中学的平房里。工作人员，由六十三人减少到十七人。工作作风更加艰苦朴素，更加接近群众。这是值得重视的一个新事物。
    无产阶级文化大革命，一项重大的任务，就是要改革机关工作和行政管理工作，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。机关工作的革命化，最根本的一条，就是要密切地联系群众。
    毛主席教导我们说，共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。
    我国是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。我们的各级领导机关，都是代表人民利益，为人民服务的。我们的一切工作人员，都必须深深扎根于群众，一刻也不脱离群众。只有这样，才能经常听到群众的声音，接受群众的监督，把群众中的意见、智慧和经验集中起来，坚持下去。只有这样，我们才能永远保持劳动人民的本色，顶住资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的攻击，在思想上筑起一道防止修正主义和避免官僚主义的长城。
    过去，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，为了复辟资本主义，拚命地搞一套臃肿庞杂的机构。官气十足、人浮于事，摆排场、闹阔气。结果使得一些领导机关严重脱离群众，使得一些干部变成了高踞于群众之上的官老爷。这个教训，难道不值得认真地记取吗？
    石家庄红代会的同志们说得好：搞机关化，就会高高在上，脱离群众；就会助长官气，发号施令，乱指挥；就会脱离火热的阶级斗争实践；就会浪费人力物力，不利于节约闹革命；就给修正主义制造了温床，不利于思想革命化。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，应该保持和发扬我党我军的光荣传统，象石家庄红代会的革命小将那样，紧紧地和群众在一起，树立艰苦朴素的革命好作风。
    实现机关革命化，是一场严重的阶级斗争。除了资产阶级思想的腐蚀以外，社会上旧的习惯势力，也是一个不小的障碍。我们要以斗私，批修为纲，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，以高度的革命自觉性，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，大破机关化，大立无产阶级的革命作风，把我们的各级领导机关都办成全心全意为人民服务的朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
