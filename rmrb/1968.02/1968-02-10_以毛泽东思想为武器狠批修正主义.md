	Use Mao Zedong Thought to Guide Everything
	— Workers of the Spinning and Coarse Spinning Workshop of Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Mill Use Mao Zedong Thought for Shift Change Records

	The revolutionary workers of the Spinning and Coarse Spinning Workshop of Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Mill, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in factory management. With the help of the PLA's leftist support troops, they collectively created the method of using Mao Zedong Thought for shift changes with the principle of "criticize selfishness, criticize revisionism." This has become a model for the entire factory's revolutionary workers to emphasize proletarian politics and promote revolution and production.

	The workers of the three shifts, A, B, and C, in this workshop began using Mao Zedong Thought for shift changes in April 1967. By now, they have written over 400 volumes totaling more than 2.3 million words of shift change records. Each record passionately praises the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought; each record angrily denounces the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. In these shift change records, the workers' determination to break selfishness and establish public-mindedness to thoroughly transform their worldview is also reflected. All shift change records express the workers' boundless love for Chairman Mao and radiate the fighting spirit of criticizing selfishness and revisionism.

	The specific method of using Mao Zedong Thought for shift changes in this workshop is summarized by the workers as "four finds, two comparisons, and one principle." The four finds are: find problems from revolutionary and production struggles, find the "selfishness" in one's own thoughts and actions, find the root cause from the depths of the soul, and find the answers from Chairman Mao's works. The two comparisons are: compare with Chairman Mao's teachings and the "Old Three Articles" to see if one has fully and thoroughly served the people and achieved "extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people"; use heroic figures as examples, use their red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao as a mirror, compare with oneself, find the gaps, and strive to catch up. The one principle is: always adhere to the principle of "criticize selfishness, criticize revisionism," and take the thorough transformation of one's worldview as a lifelong struggle.

	Use Mao Zedong Thought as a Weapon to Severely Criticize Revisionism

	Celebrate July 1st, Express Resolve to the Party

	Chairman Mao teaches us: The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China.

	The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism.

	B Shift Comrade: Today is the 46th anniversary of our Party's birthday. Over the past forty-plus years, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have defeated imperialism and overthrown the three big mountains oppressing us, and we have today's happiness. However, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party attempted to restore capitalism. This small clique of bad elements, in this unprecedented cultural revolution, is not willing to meet their doom and is stirring up trouble everywhere, ... inciting some workers to leave their production posts, attempting to achieve the goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We revolutionaries absolutely will not allow them to do this. We must express our resolve to the Party and Chairman Mao:

	Firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and defend the ironclad proletarian state.

	Defend to the death the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

	Eliminate the Poison of China's Khrushchev

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the cultural revolution.

	B Shift Comrade: ...

	China's Khrushchev is the number one counter-revolutionary revisionist. We must expose his reactionary nature in broad daylight and thoroughly eliminate his poison. ... The capitalist roaders in our factory and their masters, China's Khrushchev, attempted to restore capitalism. They treated the worker masses as slaves, promoting material incentives and implementing a set of revisionist methods to manage enterprises: control, suppress, deduct, and fine. For more than a decade, they locked us in the grip of technical expertise, not allowing us to study Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing business over politics, advocating slavery, and treating them as the embodiment of the Party, issuing orders. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, illuminating our path forward, making us see more clearly who our enemies and friends are. In the future, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, adhere to the principle of "criticize selfishness, criticize revisionism," and thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and denounce the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party!

	I Hate China's Khrushchev to Death

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Errors must be criticized, and poisonous weeds must be fought.

	A Shift Comrade: We must always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and enter the high tide of criticism with actual actions. The attitude towards the revolutionary criticism is an important indicator of whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao. I hate China's Khrushchev to death. We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly eliminate his poison in our factory. For many years, the capitalist roaders in the factory have promoted material incentives and money-first policies, proposing various reward systems: monthly bonuses, quarterly bonuses, over-fulfillment bonuses, piecework bonuses, and expansion bonuses, etc., advocating technical expertise first. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Yet China's Khrushchev and his agents in our factory dared to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, truly deserving of a thousand deaths. We must criticize and denounce them, ensuring they never rise again!

	Vigorously Refute the Fallacy of "Exploitation is Justified"

	Chairman Mao teaches us: All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely.

	C Shift Comrade: Last night, I saw you and Sister Qiao's criticism of our factory's capitalist roaders, and I felt truly relieved. Let's take a look at what kind of person the number one capitalist roader within the Party is. In feudal society and capitalist society, landlords and capitalists had the freedom to exploit, while the broad masses of laborers had no freedom from exploitation. "Exploitation is justified" was seen as a natural right by landlords and capitalists. However, in today's socialist China, the number one capitalist roader within the Party stands on the reactionary position of landlords and capitalists, advocating the fallacy of "exploitation is justified," trying every means to find a basis for "exploitation is justified" for landlords and capitalists, attempting to drag China back to the old path and restore capitalism. This is a futile attempt. We, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, resolutely do not allow it and will definitely overthrow and denounce the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, ensuring they never rise again.

### 以毛泽东思想为武器狠批修正主义

    用毛泽东思想统帅一切
    ——石家庄国棉二厂并粗车间工人用毛泽东思想交班记录摘抄
    石家庄国棉二厂并粗车间的革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在工厂企业管理上所推行的反革命修正主义黑货，在解放军支左部队的帮助下，集体创造了以“斗私，批修”为纲，用毛泽东思想交班的好方法，成为全厂革命职工突出无产阶级政治，抓革命、促生产的好样板。
    这个厂并粗车间的甲、乙、丙三班工人，以“斗私，批修”为纲，用毛泽东思想交班，是从一九六七年四月开始的，到现在他们共写了四百多本二三百万字的交班记录。篇篇记录热情地歌颂毛泽东思想的无穷威力；篇篇记录愤怒地控诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。在这些交班记录中，也反映了工人同志破私立公彻底改造世界观的决心。所有交班记录，都表达着工人阶级无限热爱毛主席的赤胆忠心，放射着工人阶级斗私批修的战斗光芒。
    这个车间用毛泽东思想交班的具体作法，工人们总结为“四找两对照一为纲”。四找是：从革命与生产斗争中找问题，从自己思想行动上找“私”字，从灵魂深处找根源，从毛主席著作中找答案。两对照是：用毛主席的教导，用“老三篇”，对照自己是否做到了“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，是否达到了“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”；以英雄人物为榜样，用他们忠于毛主席的红心当镜子，对照自己，找出差距，积极前进，努力赶上。一为纲是：始终以“斗私，批修”为纲，把彻底改造世界观作为自己终身奋斗的目标。

    以毛泽东思想为武器狠批修正主义
    庆祝“七一”，向党表决心
    毛主席教导我们：领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。
    指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。
    乙班同志：今天是我们党的生日，四十六周年纪念日。四十多年来，在党和毛主席领导下战胜了帝国主义，推翻了压在我们头上的三座大山，我们才有今天的幸福。可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却妄图复辟资本主义，这一小撮坏家伙在这一场史无前例的文化大革命中并不甘心他们的灭亡，到处煽风点火，……挑动一部分工人离开生产岗位，企图达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的。我们革命派绝对不允许他们这样干。我们要向党和毛主席表决心：
    坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，“抓革命，促生产”，保卫无产阶级铁打的江山。
    誓死捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
                                  甲班　乔桂荣
                            一九六七年七月一日
      肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒
    毛主席教导我们：谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。
      乙班同志：……
    中国的赫鲁晓夫就是头号的反革命修正主义分子，我们要把他的反动本质揭露在光天化日之下，彻底肃清其流毒。……我们厂的走资派以及他们的主子中国赫鲁晓夫企图复辟资本主义，他们把工人群众看成是奴隶，大搞物质刺激，实行管、压、扣、罚一套修正主义管理企业的方法，十几年来把我们封锁在技术挂帅上，不让我们学习毛主席著作，突出业务，提倡奴隶主义，把他们说成是党的化身，发号施令。毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，给我们照亮了前进的航道，使我们更清楚地看到谁是敌人，谁是朋友。我们今后一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把党内一小撮走资派彻底批深、批透、批倒、批臭！
                                  甲班　乔桂荣
                      一九六七年十月二十五日
      我对中国赫鲁晓夫恨死了
    毛主席教导我们：有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。
    甲班同志：我们要永远紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署前进，用实际行动投入大批判高潮中。对革命大批判的态度，是衡量我们忠于不忠于毛主席的一个重要标志。我对中国的赫鲁晓夫恨死了，我们要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底肃清他在我们二厂的流毒。多年来，厂内的走资派大搞物质刺激、金钱挂帅，提出名目繁多的奖励制度：月奖、季奖、超额奖、计件奖、扩台奖等等，大搞技术第一。毛主席教导我们说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”可是中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在我厂的代理人竟胆敢与毛泽东思想唱对台戏，真是罪该万死。我们要把他们批倒、批臭，让他们永世不得翻身！
                                  丙班　郝灵芝
                        一九六七年十月二十八日
      痛斥“剥削有功”的谬论
    毛主席教导我们：凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。
    丙班同志：昨晚上班来看到你和乔大姐对我厂走资派的批判，我感到真痛快，批得好。让我们再看看党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是个什么货色。在封建社会、资本主义社会里，地主、资本家有剥削的自由，广大劳动人民却没有不受剥削的自由。“剥削有理”被地主、资本家看做是天经地义的事情，但是在今天，在我们社会主义的中国，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却站在地主、资本家的反动立场上，宣扬什么“剥削有功”的谬论，千方百计地为地主、资本家寻找“剥削有理”的根据，妄图把中国拉回老路，复辟资本主义。这是妄想，我们广大无产阶级革命派坚决不允许，一定要把党内一小撮走资派斗倒，批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身。
