Not long ago, our area experienced continuous heavy rain for about ten days, and all the large and small ponds were filled with water. However, within less than a week after the rain stopped, the water in the small ponds and large dams had all drained away. Upon investigation, the main reason for this situation is that people have become complacent, thinking that the watering season is still far off, and that there will be plenty of rain and snow, so they do not pay attention to water storage and conservation work. The ponds and dams are left unmanaged, and those that need repairing and maintenance have not been repaired; some production teams even drained the pond water to catch fish for the New Year.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never engage in a battle without preparation." I believe that every commune and production team should assign specific people to manage the ponds and reservoirs, resolutely protect the water sources, and strive for a bumper harvest in 1968.

		Hubei Jingmen Reader

Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, on the basis of last year's unprecedented all-around bumper harvest in agriculture, we must strive for even greater development in agricultural production in 1968. This is an important part of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a glorious task for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside.

Agricultural production is highly seasonal. Now, spring plowing is not far off, and the season is pressing. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside must take immediate action, channeling the revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the Cultural Revolution into production, seizing the favorable opportunity, and solidly doing a good job in preparing for spring plowing.

Winning the battle of spring plowing preparation is the key to ensuring greater development in agricultural production this year. To win this battle, the most important thing, above all else, is to arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside must further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, combine revolution with production, and with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," strive for even greater agricultural harvests.

    修塘堰护水源
    不久以前，我们这里连续下了十来天大雨，大堰小塘都满了水。可是雨后不到七天，小塘大堰的水全都流光了。据了解，产生这一情况主要是由于大家思想麻痹，认为现在距用水季节还早，少不了雨雪，不重视蓄水保水工作，塘堰无人管理，该修该整的没有修整；有的队甚至因起鱼过年，放走了塘水。
    毛主席教导我们：“不打无准备之仗”。我认为，每一社队，都应安排专人管理好塘堰、水库，坚决保护好水源，夺取一九六八年农业大丰收。

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在去年农业空前全面大丰收的基础上，争取一九六八年农业生产的更大发展，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要组成部分，是广大贫农、下中农和农村革命干部的光荣任务。
    农业生产有强烈的季节性。现在，离春耕生产不远了，季节催人紧。农村广大贫农、下中农和革命干部要立即行动起来，把在文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产上去，抓紧有利时机，扎扎实实地做好备耕工作。
    打好备耕这一仗，是保证今年农业生产更大发展的关键。要打好这一仗，千重要，万重要，用毛泽东思想武装头脑最重要。农村广大贫农、下中农和革命干部，必须进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，抓革命促生产，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，争取农业生产更大的丰收。
