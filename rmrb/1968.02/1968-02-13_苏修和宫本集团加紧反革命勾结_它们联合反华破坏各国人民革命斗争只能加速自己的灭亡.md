The Soviet revisionists and the Miyamoto group are intensifying their counter-revolutionary collusion. Their joint anti-China activities to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries can only hasten their own doom.

	Tokyo, February 12 (New China News Agency) — A Soviet revisionist delegation led by Mikhayl Suslov, one of the top leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique, recently visited Tokyo for formal talks with the Miyamoto revisionist group. This meeting indicates that, in the face of the burgeoning revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, especially the Japanese people, the Soviet revisionists and the Miyamoto group are conspiring to tighten their collusion and further unite in their anti-China stance to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia.

	During the talks from January 31 to February 7, the Soviet revisionist delegation and the Miyamoto group held multiple secret discussions on issues such as the relationship between the "two parties," the anti-China stance, the Vietnam issue, and the "international communist movement." The joint communiqué issued after the talks proclaimed that the talks were conducted in a "comradely atmosphere" and that "both sides reached an agreement on normalizing the relationship between the two parties." This shows that the Miyamoto group and the Soviet revisionist clique have completed the formal procedure to declare their open collusion in their counter-revolutionary activities.

	The Soviet revisionists and the Miyamoto group are birds of a feather. Over the years, the Miyamoto group has increasingly become a lackey and echo of the Soviet revisionists. In 1963, due to Khrushchev's support for the Shiga revisionist group, which was vying for power with the Miyamoto group, tensions escalated, leading to some disputes. After the new leadership of the Soviet revisionists took over, they changed their approach towards the Miyamoto group, and the two sides began to collude openly and secretly. In recent years, as the Soviet revisionists have intensified their policy of betraying the Soviet and world peoples, they have been thoroughly exposed by the revolutionary people and are in an unprecedentedly isolated position. They urgently need a partner like the Miyamoto group to help them shout slogans. Meanwhile, the Miyamoto group, due to its intensified anti-China and anti-people stance, has been in chaos under the continuous rebellion of the Japanese revolutionary left, and is also in urgent need of a top traitor like the Soviet revisionists to boost its morale. The "normalization" of their relationship is a reflection of these two desperate brothers reaching the end of the road.

	One of the main topics of the talks between the Soviet revisionists and the Miyamoto group this time was the conspiracy to further unite in their anti-China stance. Before these talks, both sides had been increasingly beating the drums of anti-China propaganda. At the same time as Suslov's activities in Tokyo, another top leader of the Soviet revisionists, Alexei Kosygin, went to New Delhi to conspire with the Indian reactionaries to intensify their anti-China plots. This was not a coincidence. It was under such circumstances that the talks between the Soviet revisionists and the Miyamoto group were centered around the China issue. Although the two revisionist groups did not attack Chairman Mao Zedong, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as they usually do in their joint communiqué, Miyamoto Kenji admitted at a press conference after the issuance of the joint communiqué that "the two parties have basically the same views on China," but "it was not written in the communiqué." It is clear that through these talks, the Soviet revisionists will further use the Miyamoto group in their anti-China conspiracy activities.

	The Soviet revisionists and the Miyamoto group also discussed in their talks the issue of sabotaging the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. To deceive the Japanese and world peoples, these two revisionist groups again raised the banner of "supporting" the Vietnamese people, playing the old trick of "joint actions" that pretend to support but actually betray. They shamelessly wrote in their joint communiqué: "To support the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle, 'strengthening the unity of all anti-imperialist forces is especially important,' and 'strengthening the unity of the international communist movement is particularly important.'" However, in this joint communiqué issued in Japan, which is under the semi-occupation of American imperialism, there was not a single word about the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic just struggle, nor was there any condemnation of the crimes of American imperialism using the Sato reactionary government and the U.S. military bases in Japan to intensify the aggression against Vietnam. This proves that their so-called anti-American stance and support for the Vietnamese people are all fake, and their so-called anti-imperialist "unity" is only for the purpose of serving the American imperialists' "peace talks" conspiracy and sabotaging the international anti-American united front.

	The intensified collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Miyamoto group has been enthusiastically applauded by the imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries. After the end of their black meeting, Japanese bourgeois newspapers published numerous commentaries. The *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* said: The "reconciliation" between the Japanese revisionists and the Soviet revisionists shows that the Japanese revisionists have "moved closer to the Soviet Union again." The *Mainichi Shimbun* said: "Daikanyama and the Kremlin have entered a new era."

	The Soviet revisionists and the Miyamoto group attempt to get out of their respective predicaments through their new collusion, which is sheer delusion. In the face of the people's revolutionary storm, any desperate struggle can only hasten their doom. The Japanese revolutionary left-wing newspaper *Chōshū Shinbun* commented on this meeting: The new collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Japanese revisionists shows that they are heading towards the grave.

### 苏修和宫本集团加紧反革命勾结  它们联合反华破坏各国人民革命斗争只能加速自己的灭亡

    苏修和宫本集团加紧反革命勾结
    它们联合反华破坏各国人民革命斗争只能加速自己的灭亡
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：苏联修正主义集团的头目之一苏斯洛夫最近率领一个苏修代表团到东京同宫本修正主义集团举行了正式会谈。这次会谈表明，在亚洲各国人民，特别是日本人民的革命斗争蓬勃发展的形势下，苏修同宫本集团阴谋加紧勾结，进一步联合反华，破坏亚洲各国人民的革命斗争。
    在一月三十一日到二月七日的会谈中，苏修代表团和宫本集团围绕“两党”关系问题、反华问题、越南问题以及“共运问题”等进行了多次秘密讨论。会谈后发表的联合公报鼓吹说：“会谈是在同志式的气氛中进行的”，“双方就使两党关系正常化的问题达成了协议”。这表明宫本集团和苏修集团为了加紧反革命勾结而最后完成宣告正式同流合污的程序。
    苏修和宫本集团本来就是一丘之貉，宫本集团这些年来加速演变成苏修的帮手和应声虫。一九六三年，由于赫鲁晓夫支持了同宫本集团争权夺利的志贺修正主义集团，双方矛盾激化，曾经发生过一些吵闹。苏修新领导上台后，改变了对宫本集团的作法，双方便明里暗里不断勾结。近年来，苏修由于变本加厉地推行叛卖苏联人民和世界人民的政策，而遭到革命人民的彻底揭露，处境空前孤立，急需有宫本集团这样一个伙伴进一步帮他摇旗呐喊。同时，宫本集团也由于加紧反华、反人民，在日本革命左派不断造反的情况下乱成一团，惶惶不可终日，也急需有苏修这样一个头号叛徒替它打气撑腰。它们的关系的“正常化”，正是这对难兄难弟穷途末路的反映。
    苏修同宫本集团这次会谈的一个主要内容是密谋进一步联合反华的问题。在这次会谈前，它们的反华锣鼓都越敲越紧，而在苏斯洛夫到东京活动的同时，苏修的另一个大头目柯西金去新德里同印度反动派密商加紧反华的阴谋，这绝非偶然。正是在这样的情况下，苏修和宫本集团的会谈始终是围绕着中国问题进行的。虽然这两个修正主义集团在联合公报中没有象平日那样恶毒地攻击伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想以及史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，但是宫本显治在发表联合公报后举行的记者招待会上供认：“两党对中国的看法大体一致”，只是“在公报中没有写”。很明显，通过这次会谈，苏修将在它的反华阴谋活动中进一步使用宫本集团。
    苏修和宫本集团在会谈中特别讨论了破坏越南人民抗美救国斗争问题。为了欺骗日本人民和世界人民，这两个修正主义集团又打起“支援”越南人民的幌子，玩弄旨在搞假支持真出卖的“联合行动”的故技。它们在联合公报中厚颜无耻地写道：为了“支援”越南人民的反美斗争，“加强所有反帝势力的团结特别重要”，“加强国际共产主义运动的团结尤其特别重要”。但是，在处于美帝半占领下的日本发表的这个联合公报，竟然只字不提日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争，更没有谴责美帝利用日本佐藤反动政府和在日美军基地加紧侵略越南的罪行，这就证明它们所叫嚷的反美和支援越南人民完全是假的，而它们所强调的反帝“团结”，只不过为了达到它们为美帝“和谈”阴谋效劳和破坏国际反美统一战线的罪恶目的而已。
    苏修和宫本集团的加紧勾结受到了帝国主义和日本反动派的热烈喝采。在它们这次黑会结束后，日本资产阶级报纸连篇累牍地发表评论。《产经新闻》说：日修和苏修的“和解”，表明日修向苏联“又靠近了一步”。《每日新闻》说：“代代木和克里姆林进入了新时代。”
    苏修和宫本集团企图通过它们的新勾结来摆脱它们各自所处的困境，这完全是痴心妄想。在人民革命风暴面前，任何垂死的挣扎，都只能加速它们的灭亡。日本革命左派的报纸《长周新闻》在评论这次会谈时指出：苏修和日修的新勾结表明它们正在向灭亡的坟地前进。
