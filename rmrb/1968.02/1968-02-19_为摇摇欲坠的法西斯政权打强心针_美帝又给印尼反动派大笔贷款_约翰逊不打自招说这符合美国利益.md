The fascist military regime in Indonesia is facing unprecedented political and economic difficulties. Recently, U.S. imperialism has consecutively provided Indonesia with a total of $6 million in loans, injecting a stimulus into this extremely weak reactionary regime.

According to reports from Western news agencies, on the 15th, Indonesia's fascist military regime's Foreign Minister Malik signed an agreement with the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Green, to provide Indonesia with a $3.5 million loan. Prior to this, on the 13th, the U.S. decided to provide Indonesia with a $2.5 million loan.

The fascist military regime in Indonesia is in a situation where it cannot survive without external aid. The head of this regime, Suharto, admitted last October that despite Indonesia's total foreign debt reaching $2.7 billion by 1967, his regime still needed $325 million in external aid in 1968. According to reports, this external aid will mainly be begged from the U.S. For this purpose, Malik, on Suharto's orders, went to Melbourne, Australia, last December to beg from the then U.S. leader Johnson who was active there.

According to the Jakarta radio station, Malik at that time handed over "a letter regarding the situation in Indonesia" from Suharto to Johnson. Johnson expressed to Malik that the U.S. would provide one-third of the total external aid needed by the Indonesian fascist military regime in 1968.

Johnson's eagerness to "aid" his lackeys is entirely in the service of U.S. imperialist counter-revolutionary interests. On February 8, Johnson, when talking about his 1968 "foreign aid message," admitted that Indonesia needs U.S. help, "providing such aid is entirely in our interests."

    为摇摇欲坠的法西斯政权打强心针
    美帝又给印尼反动派大笔贷款
    约翰逊不打自招说这符合美国利益
    据新华社十七日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权面临空前未有的政治、经济困难，美帝国主义最近接连向印尼提供总数六千万美元的贷款，为这个极端虚弱的反动政权打强心针。
    据西方通讯社报道，印尼法西斯军人政权的外交部长马利克十五日同美国驻印尼大使格林签订一项协定，由美国向印尼提供三千五百万美元贷款。在这以前，十三日，美国决定向印尼提供两千五百万美元贷款。
    印尼法西斯军人政权已处在没有外援就不能过活的困境。这个政权的头目苏哈托去年十月供认，尽管到一九六七年印尼共欠外债二十七亿美元，他的政权在一九六八年仍然需要外援三亿二千五百万美元。据报道，这笔外援，主要将向美国乞讨。为此，马利克奉苏哈托之命曾于去年十二月到澳大利亚墨尔本向当时在那里活动的美帝头子约翰逊伸手乞讨。
    据雅加达电台透露，当时马利克曾把苏哈托的“一封有关印尼情况的信件”交给了约翰逊。约翰逊向马利克表示，美国将向印尼法西斯军人政权提供一九六八年所需外援总数的三分之一。
    约翰逊如此热衷于“援助”它的走狗，完全是为美帝国主义的反革命利益服务的。二月八日，约翰逊在谈到他的一九六八年“援外咨文”时承认，印度尼西亚需要美国的帮助，“提供这种援助，完全符合我们的利益。”
