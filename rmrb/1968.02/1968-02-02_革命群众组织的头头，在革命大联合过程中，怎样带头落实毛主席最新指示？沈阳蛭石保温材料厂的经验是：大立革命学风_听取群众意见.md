The leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, during the process of revolutionary great unity, how should they take the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions? The experience of Shenyang Hirudo Insulation Material Factory is: establish a revolutionary learning style and listen to the masses' opinions.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: The three factions of revolutionary mass organizations in Shenyang Hirudo Insulation Material Factory, with the assistance of the local military's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, held joint Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The leaders took the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity, and the entire factory's revolution and production presented a great situation.

	Learn one, use one, implement one

On December 19th of last year, the three factions of revolutionary mass organizations in this factory jointly held the first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class, mainly for the leaders. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "as long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they must achieve revolutionary great unity under the principle of revolution," some comrades proposed: "After learning, we must use it, we must see immediate results, and immediately implement revolutionary great unity." This initiative immediately received the support of the majority of comrades, but some leaders advocated waiting until the end of the study class to discuss it.

	How should we proceed? They brought this question to the study class, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on rectifying the learning style. Chairman Mao said: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be proficient in it and apply it; the purpose of being proficient is entirely for application." Chairman Mao's teachings deepened everyone's understanding of the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao. They said, learning and then using it, seeing immediate results, is the core of the revolutionary learning style. After learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions, whether to use them or not, whether to use them quickly or slowly, whether to stay on the surface or to use them thoroughly, is a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a touchstone to distinguish between genuine and false revolutionaries.

	Once the attitude is correct, the consciousness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions immediately increases. Everyone decided to take the lead in learning and using, learning one point, using one point, implementing one point, consolidating one point. They, based on Chairman Mao's teaching of "each side making more self-criticism," fiercely fought against the thoughts of "only I am leftist" and "only I am revolutionary." At the same time, by emphasizing common points, they effectively solved the long-standing problem of not recognizing each other as revolutionary mass organizations. After a few days of specific negotiations, the entire factory achieved revolutionary great unity and established a Great Unity Committee.

	Humbly listen to the masses' opinions, do not be self-righteous

In the early stages of the Mao Zedong Thought study class, especially before establishing the revolutionary learning style, the leaders often argued without resolution. The more they talked, the more tense the atmosphere became, and the thinner the unity atmosphere became. In this situation, the worker masses could no longer tolerate it. Many masses flocked to the study class to listen, bring Chairman Mao's quotations, and express their hopes. Some even bluntly proposed: "We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Will you leaders take the lead in advancing or pulling us back? If you continue to 'argue' and put Chairman Mao's latest instructions aside, we will unite ourselves and advance!"

	To the worker masses' series of "challenges," the majority of comrades felt inspired, deeply educated, and warmly welcomed. However, some comrades still insisted on their leadership, were self-righteous, and unconcerned, even showing impatience. Should we listen to the masses or be self-righteous? They brought this question to the study class, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in and relying on the masses. Using Chairman Mao's teachings to repeatedly reflect on themselves, their minds gradually cleared, and they increasingly felt that their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions was not as deep as the worker masses', and that they did not follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment as closely and tightly as the worker masses. After raising their awareness, they decided to let the masses supervise them in overcoming factionalism. They opened the doors of the study class wide, adopting the method of inviting in and going out. Thus, a new situation quickly formed where everyone learned and used Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the masses urged the leaders, the leaders led the masses, everyone learned and used, and quickly implemented. This strongly promoted revolutionary great unity.

	Firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words, do not be disturbed by factionalism

The news of the three factions of revolutionary mass organizations in this factory achieving revolutionary great unity quickly spread, causing a strong reaction within and outside the factory, with enthusiastic revolutionary congratulations and interference and pressure from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. They said things like, "At this time, achieving great unity is 'unfavorable' for the struggle." Some even criticized a certain revolutionary mass organization's leader as being "without principles" and "riding the wave."

	Should we act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions or according to the wishes of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism? They brought this question to the study class, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "promoting consideration for the overall situation" and "everything from the people's interests, not from personal or small group interests." They conducted specific analyses and criticisms of various criticisms.

	Is achieving revolutionary great unity 'unfavorable' for the revolutionary struggle? They said, achieving revolutionary great unity is conducive to the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," conducive to improving the struggle-criticism-transformation in this unit, and conducive to implementing Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army, love the people" and "grasp revolution, promote production." This completely conforms to the fundamental interests of the proletariat and revolutionary people. How can it be said to be 'unfavorable' for the revolutionary struggle?

	Is achieving revolutionary great unity "without principles"? What kind of principles are needed? They said, we firmly act according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "under the principle of revolution" to unite. Chairman Mao says how, we do how. This is the highest and greatest principle.

	As for saying this is "riding the wave," everyone pointed out: the wave of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism cannot be ridden. Closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly acting according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving revolutionary great unity, this is a great revolutionary tide. The faster we ride it, the better.

	After a specific analysis, the original leaders of the various factions realized that they were influenced by these wrong criticisms precisely because bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism was playing tricks in their minds. If factionalism is not thoroughly overcome, Chairman Mao's latest instructions cannot be implemented, and even if united, it cannot be consolidated. Thus, they focused their efforts and time, thoroughly exposing the crimes of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, discussing the harm of factionalism, and digging out the roots of factionalism. They waged a "surrounding and annihilation" battle against factionalism, consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity.

    革命群众组织的头头，在革命大联合过程中，怎样带头落实毛主席最新指示？沈阳蛭石保温材料厂的经验是：
    大立革命学风  听取群众意见
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳蛭石保温材料厂三派革命群众组织，在沈阳驻军毛泽东思想宣传队的协助下，通过联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，头头带头落实毛主席的最新指示，迅速实现了革命的大联合，全厂革命、生产呈现一派大好景象。
      学一条，用一条，落实一条
    去年十二月十九日，这个厂的三派革命群众组织，联合办起了主要由头头参加的第一期毛泽东思想学习班。各派的头头学习了毛主席“只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合”的最新指示以后，有的同志提出：“学了就要用，要立竿见影，马上实行革命大联合。”这个倡议，立刻得到了多数同志的支持，但有的头头，却主张到学习班结束后再说。
    究竟应该怎么办？他们带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席关于整顿学风的教导。毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”毛主席的教导，使大家加深了对毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风的理解。他们说，学了就用，立竿见影，是革命学风的核心。学了毛主席的最新指示，用还是不用，是快用还是慢慢来，是停留在嘴皮子上还是踏踏实实地狠用、彻底用，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线忠不忠的问题，是区别真假革命派的试金石。
    态度端正了，对毛主席的最新指示学了就用的自觉性就大大提高了，大家决心带头学，带头用，学一条，用一条，落实一条，巩固一条。他们本着毛主席“各自多做自我批评”的教导，狠斗“唯我独左”、“唯我独革”的思想，同时通过大摆共同点，有效地解决了互不承认对方是革命群众组织的老大难问题。经过短短三两天的具体协商，全厂就实现了革命的大联合，成立了大联合委员会。
  虚心听群众的意见，不要自以为是
    在毛泽东思想学习班开办的初期，特别是在建立革命学风以前，头头们总是争执不下。越谈空气越紧张，联合的气氛就越淡薄。在这种情况下，工人群众再也忍耐不下去了，许多群众纷纷到学习班旁听，送毛主席语录，提希望。有的甚至直截了当地提出：“我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署是跟定了，你们头头究竟是带头前进，还是拉我们倒退？如果你们再把毛主席的最新指示搁在一边，继续‘扯皮’，我们就要自己联合起来前进了！”
    对于工人群众这一连串的“将军”，多数同志感到鼓舞，深受教育，热烈欢迎。但是，也有的同志仍然以头头自居，自以为是，不以为然，甚至流露出一种不耐烦的情绪。究竟是听群众的，还是自以为是？他们带着这个问题，集中学习了毛主席关于相信群众、依靠群众的教导。用毛主席教导反复对照自己，头脑渐渐清醒了，越来越觉得对毛主席最新指示的理解，自己没有工人群众深，跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，没有工人群众跟得快、跟得紧。大家认识提高以后，决心让群众来监督自己克服派性。他们大开学习班之门，采取请进来、走出去的办法。这样，很快就形成了一个大学大用毛主席最新指示，群众促头头，头头带群众，人人学、人人用，快快学、快快落实的新局面，有力地促进了革命的大联合。
  坚决听毛主席的话，不受派性干扰
    这个厂三派革命群众组织实现革命大联合的喜讯，很快传开了，在厂内外，引起了强烈的反响，有充满革命激情的祝贺，也有来自资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的干扰和压力。说什么，在这个时候实现大联合，对斗争“不利”。有的甚至指责某一革命群众组织的头头，是“没有原则”，是“赶浪头”。
    究竟是照毛主席的最新指示办事，还是按资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的意愿行事？他们带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席“要提倡顾全大局”“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”的教导，对各种指责，进行了具体分析、批判。
    实现革命大联合，对革命斗争究竟是有利还是不利？他们说，实现了革命的大联合，这有利于革命的“三结合”，有利于搞好本单位的斗批改，有利于贯彻执行毛主席“拥军爱民”、“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，这完全符合无产阶级和革命人民的根本利益，怎么能说对革命斗争“不利”呢？
    实现革命大联合是“没有原则”吗？究竟要什么样的原则？他们说，我们坚决按照毛主席的最新指示办事，“在革命的原则下”联合起来，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，这就是最高最大的原则。
    至于说这是“赶浪头”，大家指出：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的浪头不能赶。紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决按照毛主席的最新指示办事，实现革命的大联合，这是伟大的革命潮流，赶得越快越好。
    经过一番具体分析，原各派革命群众组织的头头察觉到，自己所以受到这些错误指责的影响，正是由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性在自己头脑里作怪；如果不把派性彻底打倒，毛主席的最新指示就落实不了，联合了也不能巩固。于是，他们就集中精力，集中时间，大摆资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的罪状，大论派性的危害，大挖派性的根源，对派性打了一场“围歼战”，使革命大联合得到了巩固和发展。
