People around the world demonstrate and march in celebration of the Vietnamese people's New Year victories, opposing U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

Pakistani people march to honor the heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians

On the 9th, people in Lahore, the capital of West Pakistan, held an anti-U.S. demonstration to celebrate the glorious victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and civilians since the New Year.

Many factory workers, students, and people from various walks of life participated in the demonstration. They carried placards and shouted slogans as they marched through the streets of the central district of Lahore. The placards read: "Long live the great victory of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression!" "Salute to the heroic freedom fighters of South Vietnam!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with the U.S. murderers!" "U.S. out of Vietnam!" "U.S. out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Pakistani people stand with the Vietnamese people!"

The demonstrators also shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Pak-China friendship!" to express their respect for China, which firmly supports the struggle of the Vietnamese people.

The demonstrators distributed leaflets to passersby. One leaflet stated that imperialism is a paper tiger. The brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people once again prove this great truth: the decisive factor in war is people, not weapons.

Another leaflet said that the great victories won by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the U.S. aggressors are a common victory for all the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. All the oppressed people in the world who want to break free from the shackles of imperialism must use force, not beg for mercy from the imperialists as some people advocate.

French students take to the streets shouting "Down with U.S. imperialism!"

More than three thousand Paris students and young workers held a demonstration that lasted over three hours on the evening of the 7th, opposing U.S. aggression in Vietnam and celebrating the great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and civilians in their recent all-out attacks on the U.S.-puppet clique.

At around 7:30 PM, approximately two thousand demonstrators carrying banners, placards, and flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, as well as portraits of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, gathered in a square to hold a meeting.

After the meeting, the demonstrators marched, singing songs of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and shouting slogans such as: "Long live the mighty offensive of the National Liberation Front!" "The National Liberation Front will surely win!" "Long live the people's war!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of all the people of the world!" "The struggle of the Vietnamese people is an example for the people of all countries!" "Long live the struggles of all peoples!"

By 9:00 PM, the marching crowd had grown to over three thousand. They proceeded to the boulevards of Paris. At this point, reactionary police arrived to suppress the demonstration. The demonstrators clashed with them fiercely. Around 10:00 PM, some demonstrators regrouped and once again resisted the police's attack.

West German youth storm "American House" to denounce the Americans

In recent days, young people in several cities in West Germany have held demonstrations against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

In Munich, a major city in southern West Germany, more than sixty young people demonstrated in front of the "American House," a cultural infiltration institution of the United States, on the evening of the 8th. At that time, the cultural attaché of the U.S. Embassy in West Germany was presiding over the opening ceremony of an exhibition inside. The demonstrators distributed leaflets condemning U.S. aggression in Vietnam and shouted: "Johnson, the murderer!" "Kill Johnson!" They also shouted the name of Ho Chi Minh, the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people.

In their angry demonstration, these young people stormed into the hall of the "American House." Some demonstrators rushed onto the stage and overturned the podium in front of the American cultural attaché who was speaking. They held high a flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on the stage. Some demonstrators spray-painted "Kill Johnson" in large letters on the screen prepared for a slide show. The demonstrators also set off firecrackers and prevented the American cultural attaché from propagating American "culture," demanding that he speak of the U.S. crimes of aggression in Vietnam. The brave actions of the demonstrators made the American cultural attaché look disheveled and forced him to suspend the opening ceremony of the exhibition. At the same time, another hundred young people demonstrated outside the "American House" and threw paint bags at it.

The Munich municipal authorities, in order to protect the Americans, dispatched a large number of police who brutally arrested forty demonstrators.

In Hamburg, a major city in northern West Germany, three thousand students demonstrated in front of the "American House," a cultural infiltration institution of the United States, on the 9th, protesting against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

In addition, several hundred young students in Tübingen also held similar demonstrations on the 8th.

Dutch public holds up the gold star red and blue flag to demonstrate in front of the parliament building

Five hundred members of the public in the Netherlands demonstrated in The Hague on the evening of the 6th, protesting against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

The demonstrators carried flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and marched towards the parliament building. In front of the Dutch parliament, which was debating the situation in Vietnam, the demonstrators shouted: "Down with Johnson!" "Johnson is a murderer!"

After struggling with the police dispatched by the authorities, a group of young demonstrators carrying banners condemning U.S. aggression in Vietnam entered the courtyard of the parliament to hold a demonstration.

Uruguayans hold anti-U.S. demonstration and burn the American flag

On the evening of the 3rd, the people of Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, held an anti-U.S. demonstration and march, strongly protesting against U.S. aggression in Vietnam and expressing support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the Americans.

Demonstrators shouting anti-U.S. slogans burned an American flag on the streets of Montevideo. They also threw tar at an exhibition organized by the American AFL-CIO in Montevideo and smashed the windows of Pan American World Airways.

    越南人民必胜  美帝国主义必败
    各国人民示威游行欢呼越南南方军民新春大捷，反对美帝侵略越南
    巴基斯坦人民游行向英雄的南越军民致敬
    西巴基斯坦首府拉合尔人民九日举行反美示威，祝贺越南南方军民新春以来取得的辉煌胜利。
    许多工厂工人、学生和其他各界人士参加了这次示威。他们举着标语牌，高呼战斗口号，在拉合尔市中心区的街道上游行。标语牌上面写着：“越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争的伟大胜利万岁！”“向英雄的越南南方自由战士致敬！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒美国杀人犯！”“美国从越南滚出去！”“美国从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲滚出去！”“巴基斯坦人民同越南人民站在一起！”
    示威者还高呼“毛泽东主席万岁！”“巴中友好万岁！”的口号，向坚决支持越南人民斗争的中国表示敬意。
    示威者向行人散发了传单。一张传单说，帝国主义是纸老虎。越南人民取得的光辉胜利，再次证实了这个伟大真理：在战争中起决定作用的因素是人而不是武器。
    另一张传单说，越南人民在反对美国侵略者的斗争中赢得的巨大胜利，是全体亚非拉人民的共同胜利。世界上一切被压迫人民，要摆脱帝国主义的枷锁，就必须使用暴力，而不是象某些人所宣扬的用眼泪去哀求帝国主义。
    法国学生走上街头高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”
    三千多名巴黎大中学生和青年工人，七日晚举行了持续三个多小时的示威游行，反对美帝国主义侵略越南，欢呼越南南方军民最近全面袭击美伪集团所取得的伟大胜利。
    下午七点多钟，约两千名示威者拿着横幅标语和标语牌，举着越南民主共和国国旗、越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜和胡志明主席、阮友寿主席的画像，在一个广场上举行集会。
    示威者在集会以后举行了游行。他们高唱越南南方民族解放阵线的歌曲，并且高呼口号：“（越南南方）民族解放阵线的强大攻势万岁！”“民族解放阵线必胜！”“人民战争万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义是全世界人民的头号敌人！”“越南人民的斗争是世界各国人民的榜样！”
    “各国人民的斗争万岁！”等等。
    到晚上九点钟时，游行队伍增加到三千多人。他们行进到巴黎市区的林荫大道上。这时，反动军警赶来镇压。示威群众同他们发生了激烈的冲突。十点钟左右，部分示威者重新集合起来，再次抗击了军警的袭击。
    西德青年冲进“美国之家”痛斥美国佬
    西德一些城市的青年连日举行反对美帝国主义侵略越南的示威。
    在西德南部大城市慕尼黑，六十多名青年八日晚在美国文化侵略机构“美国之家”前面举行示威，当时美国驻西德大使馆的文化专员正在里面主持一个展览的开幕式。示威青年散发了谴责美帝侵略越南的传单，并且高呼：“约翰逊杀人犯！”“杀死约翰逊！”他们还高呼越南人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席的名字。
    这些青年在愤怒的示威中冲进了“美国之家”的大厅。一部分示威者冲上讲台，推翻了正在讲话的那个美国文化专员面前的讲桌。他们在台上高高地举起了一面越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜。一些示威者在准备放映幻灯片的银幕上用油漆喷射了“杀死约翰逊”几个大字。示威群众还燃放了爆竹，并且禁止美国文化专员宣扬美国的“文化”，而要他讲美国在越南的侵略罪行。示威者的英勇行动把这个美国佬弄得狼狈不堪，并且使他所主持的展览开幕式不得不中断。在这同时，另外一百名青年在“美国之家”外面举行示威，并且向它投掷漆袋。
    慕尼黑市当局为了保护美国佬，出动了大批警察，野蛮地逮捕了四十名示威者。
    在西德北部大城市汉堡，三千名大中学生九日在美国文化侵略机构“美国之家”前面举行示威，抗议美帝侵略越南。
    此外，图宾根的数百名青年学生在八日也举行了类似的示威。
    荷兰公众高举金星红蓝旗在议会大厦示威
    荷兰五百名公众六日晚在海牙举行示威，抗议美国侵略越南。
    示威者举着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，走向议会大厦。示威者在正在就越南局势举行辩论的荷兰议会前面高呼：“打倒约翰逊！”“约翰逊是杀人犯！”
    经过同当局出动的警察进行斗争后，一批示威青年举着谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的横幅标语进入议会的院子里举行了示威。
    乌拉圭群众举行反美示威烧毁美国国旗
    乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚的群众三日晚上举行反美示威游行，强烈抗议美帝国主义侵略越南，并表示支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。
    高呼反美口号的示威群众，在蒙得维的亚的大街上烧毁了一面美国国旗。他们还向美国劳联—产联在蒙得维的亚举办的展览会投掷了沥青，并且打碎了美国泛美航空公司的窗户。（据新华社讯）
