Activists from study classes in eleven brigades of Niu Baotun Commune in Tongxian County, Beijing, make circuit reports to help cadres lighten their loads and lead spring plowing.

	The People's Daily reports: Actively supporting the broad masses of cadres to stand tall and make revolution is a key to doing a good job in spring plowing production. With the help of the Beijing Air Force of the People's Liberation Army, the eleven brigades in the northern part of Niu Baotun Commune have organized activists from Mao Zedong Thought study classes to make circuit reports addressing various active thoughts among cadres and the masses. This has helped cadres, rebel leaders, and the masses solve many ideological problems, mobilized the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and spring plowing production has presented a new and vibrant scene.

	Before the study classes were organized, there were three main problems in this area: First, some cadres could not correctly handle the mass movement, feeling that being a cadre was a thankless job and wanting to "throw down their tools." Second, the rebels could not correctly handle the cadres, with "selfishness" getting the better of them, not daring to liberate the cadres for fear of retaliation. Third, the families of cadres thought that being a cadre was "not worth it," pulling their husbands back.

	To address these active thoughts, after the study classes were organized, they selected a group of activists who studied the works of Chairman Mao and cadres, rebel leaders, and family members of cadres who had some ideological problems. They concentrated on studying and cultivating cadres. Starting from the education of the two-line struggle, they carried out remembrance of bitterness and thinking of sweetness, deeply studying and applying the "Three Articles," continuously deepening the class feelings of the students towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and their hatred towards the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. They made them realize that Liu Shaoqi is the root of "selfishness," the representative of "revisionism," and the enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	After the ideological awareness of the cadres was raised, the propaganda team organized them to go to various study classes to expose their selfishness and fight against it, which aroused a strong response among the broad students.

	Lin Wang, an activist who studied the works of Chairman Mao and the former Party branch secretary of Sanjianfang Brigade, was a poor child who grew up in bitterness. The scars on his body from being whipped by the landlord and his happy life after liberation made him deeply understand the importance of power, and he has always striven to grasp and use power for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Because his work style was a bit rigid and he did not consult with the masses enough on matters, the masses posted some big-character posters criticizing him during the movement. But he always followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party," correctly handling the mass movement, concentrating all his hatred on the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by Liu Shaoqi. He said, the masses criticizing me shows that there are shortcomings and errors in my work, and that I have not firmly grasped and used the power entrusted to me by the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the future, I will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants' expectations for me, and I will grasp and use power well for the revolution. Therefore, he actively sought the opinions of revolutionary masses, bravely stood out, and took on the two heavy burdens of revolution and production. His report gave the students a great education, and many cadres deeply examined themselves.

	Rebel leader Liu Guoxiang reported to everyone about his struggle against selfishness, helping Lin Wang stand out, and supporting Lin Wang in making the revolution, which gave a great education to other rebel leaders. They said, we did not dare to liberate the cadres because the "selfishness" in our minds was playing tricks, fearing that the cadres would come to power and give us a hard time. If we go on like this, we will definitely interfere with the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and cadre policy. Some brigades organized study classes but did not allow cadres to participate. After hearing Liu Guoxiang's report, they immediately allowed cadres to participate in the study classes, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, and had a further understanding of Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

	Zhang Fengying is a member of the leading cadre of Sanjianfang Brigade. She has many children and heavy household chores, and her work encountered many difficulties. But she insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, arming herself with Mao Zedong Thought, properly arranging her household chores, and doing her work well. Many family members of cadres were inspired by her report. The wife of the brigade leader of Lushinzhuang, Wang Xiangyu, examined her wrong thoughts of pulling her husband back, and she said, in the future, I will definitely learn from Zhang Fengying, thoroughly fight against the "selfishness" in my mind, and firmly support my husband in making the revolution. Under Wang Xiangyu's influence, many family members of cadres examined themselves and said they would definitely actively help their husbands stand up and make the revolution.

	The circuit reports by activists from Mao Zedong Thought study classes have had a tremendous impact. At present, all eleven brigades in this area have achieved revolutionary great unity, more than 95% of the cadres have been liberated, and they are all actively taking on the two heavy burdens of revolution and production. The labor enthusiasm of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants has generally been raised, and they are now focusing on fertilizing, transporting fertilizer, and field management. Spring plowing production is being carried out in high spirits.

    牛堡屯公社十一个大队组织学习班积极分子作巡回报告
    帮助干部轻装上阵领导春耕
    本报讯　积极支持广大基层干部挺起腰杆干革命，建立和健全革命化的领导班子，是当前搞好春耕生产的一个关键。北京通县牛堡屯公社北片十一个大队，在解放军北京空军某部帮助下，组织毛泽东思想学习班的积极分子，针对干部、群众中存在的各种活思想作巡回报告，帮助干部、造反派头头和群众解决了许多思想问题，调动了干部和群众的积极性，春耕生产呈现一片崭新气象。
    学习班开办以前，这个片普遍存在着三个问题：一是部分干部不能正确对待群众运动，认为当干部是出力不讨好，想趁机“撂挑子”。二是造反派不能正确对待干部，“私”字作怪，不敢大胆解放干部，怕打击报复。三是干部家属认为，当干部“不合算”，拉干部后腿。
    针对这些活思想，学习班办起来以后，他们从学员中选拔了一批学习毛主席著作的积极分子和思想认识上存在着一些问题的干部、造反派头头、干部家属，集中起来进行学习，培养骨干。首先从两条路线斗争教育入手，开展忆苦思甜，大学大用“老三篇”，不断加深学员们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的深厚阶级感情，和对资产阶级反动路线的刻骨仇恨。使他们认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫是“私”字的总根子，是“修”字的总代表，是贫下中农的死对头。
    骨干思想觉悟提高了，宣传队便组织他们到各个学习班去亮私斗私，在广大学员中引起了强烈的反响。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、三间房大队原党支部书记林旺，是个苦水里泡大的穷孩子。他身上被地主皮鞭抽打的伤痕和解放后的幸福生活，使他深深地懂得政权的重要性，一直努力为贫下中农掌权、用权。由于他工作作风有些生硬，遇事同群众商量不够，运动中群众给他贴了一些大字报。但他始终按照毛主席“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党”的教导，正确对待群众运动，把千仇万恨集中在中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线上。他说，群众批判我，说明我工作中有缺点，有错误，把贫下中农交给我的权掌得不牢，用得不好。今后我一定不辜负毛主席和广大贫下中农对我的期望，为革命掌好权，用好权。因此，他积极主动地征求革命群众的意见，勇敢站出来，挑起了革命和生产两副重担。他的报告给了学员们极大教育，许多干部都深刻地检查了自己。
    造反派头头刘国祥，向大家报告了他狠斗私心，帮助林旺站出来，支持林旺站出来革命的转变过程，给其他造反派的头头们极大教育。他们说，我们不敢解放干部，是由于头脑中的“私”字作怪，怕干部上台后给自己小鞋穿。这样下去，必然干扰毛主席的革命路线和干部政策的贯彻执行。有些大队办学习班，不让干部参加，听了刘国祥的报告，马上吸收干部参加学习班，一块学习毛主席的最新指示，对毛主席的干部政策有了进一步的体会。
    张凤英是三间房大队的领导班子的成员，孩子多，家务重，工作遇到不少困难，但她坚持活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，妥善安排家务，把工作做好了。许多干部家属听了她的报告，很受启发。陆辛庄大队长的爱人王香玉，检查了自己拉爱人后腿的错误思想，她表示，今后一定要向张凤英学习，彻底斗倒头脑里的“私”字，坚决支持爱人干革命。在王香玉的带动下，许多干部家属都检查了自己，表示一定要主动帮助爱人起来干革命。
    毛泽东思想学习班积极分子的巡回报告，发生了巨大的影响。目前这个片十一个大队全部实现了革命大联合，百分之九十五以上的干部得到了解放，都积极挑起了革命和生产两副重担。广大贫农下中农的劳动积极性普遍提高，正在抓紧积肥送肥和田间管理工作，春耕生产搞得热火朝天。
