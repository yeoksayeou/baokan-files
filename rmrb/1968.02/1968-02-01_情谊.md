One day, a sudden downpour hit the island, and a pair of shoes belonging to soldier Xu Lairen of a certain company was washed away by the flood. After the rain, he searched along the path where the water had flowed several times but did not find them. Seven days later, a 60-something-year-old man named Dong Muguai unexpectedly brought the shoes to the company.

On that day, Dong's young grandson was catching small fish in a water hole by the village beach. Accidentally, he dug out a shoe from the sand. Seeing that it was a soldier's shoe, Dong thought that it might have been washed down from the mountain during the recent heavy rain. He also thought: Soldiers are very disciplined when it comes to placing their belongings, always putting a pair of shoes together. If they were washed away, it should be a pair, so how come only one shoe was found?

Every day on his way to and from work, he used a hoe to dig through each small water hole and also walked along the sand at low tide. As expected, young militia member Lin Tian Guan also found a shoe while catching fish. Upon hearing that Grandpa was looking for a shoe, he brought it to Grandpa's house. Dong quickly matched the two shoes together, and they were indeed a pair. With a heart full of affection for the People's Liberation Army, he hurriedly brought the shoes to the company.

    情谊
    一天，岛上突然下起暴雨，某连战士徐来仁的一双鞋子被大水冲走了。雨后，他顺着水冲过的地方寻找了几次都没找到。事过七天，一位六十多岁的董木贵老大爷，却意外地把鞋子送到连里。
    这一天，董大爷的小孙子在村边海滩的水洞里抓小鱼，无意中从沙里扒出一只鞋。董大爷看是解放军的鞋子，就考虑到可能是前几天的一场暴雨，把解放军的鞋子从山上冲到这里来了。他还想到：解放军放东西最有规矩，晒鞋子总是一双放在一起，要冲一定是一双，怎么只见到一只呢？
    每天在上工、下工的路上，他用锄头把一个个小水洞都扒过，还到退潮的沙滩上去走走。不出所料，小民兵林天官在抓鱼时也发现了一只鞋子，听说大爷找鞋子，就把鞋子送到大爷家里。董大爷急忙把两只鞋一凑合，正是一双，怀着一片热爱人民解放军的情谊，急忙把鞋子送到连里。
