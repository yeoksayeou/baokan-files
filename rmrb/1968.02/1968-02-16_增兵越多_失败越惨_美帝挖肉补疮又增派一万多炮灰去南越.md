The more troops sent, the worse the defeat. The U.S. imperialists, in a desperate attempt to patch up their wounds, are hastily dispatching over ten thousand more cannon fodder to South Vietnam.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 14th, in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people's overwhelming victories over the American aggressors since the New Year, the Johnson administration announced on the 13th that it would urgently dispatch 1,050 more cannon fodder to South Vietnam for emergency relief.

In announcing this news, Assistant Secretary of Defense Goulding revealed that this troop increase was a "rescue" measure taken in response to the request of the defeated commander of the U.S. forces in South Vietnam, General Westmoreland.

Currently, the number of U.S. invasion troops in South Vietnam has reached 500,000. According to the original plan, this number was to be increased to 525,000 by the end of June this year.

    增兵越多　失败越惨
    美帝挖肉补疮又增派一万多炮灰去南越
    据新华社十四日讯　华盛顿消息：在英雄的越南南方军民新春以来把美国侵略者打得落花流水，无法招架的情况下，约翰逊政府十三日宣布火速增派一万零五百名炮灰去南越救急。
    美国国防部助理部长古尔丁在宣布这一消息时透露，这次增兵是应南越人民手下败将、侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰的要求而采取的一个“抢险”措施。
    目前，美国在南越的侵略兵力已达五十万人；按原来宣布的计划，在今年六月底以前将增加到五十二万五千人。
