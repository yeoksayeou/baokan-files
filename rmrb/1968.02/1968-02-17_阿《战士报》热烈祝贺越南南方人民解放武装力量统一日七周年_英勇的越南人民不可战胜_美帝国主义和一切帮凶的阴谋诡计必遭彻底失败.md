The Albanian "Warrior" newspaper warmly congratulates the seventh anniversary of the Unified Day of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam. The heroic Vietnamese people are invincible. The conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism and all its accomplices will surely be thoroughly defeated.

Tirana, February 15, Xinhua News Agency: The editorial department of the Albanian People's Army's "Warrior" newspaper published an article on February 15, warmly congratulating the seventh anniversary of the Unified Day of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam.

The article said that on the seventh anniversary of its birth, the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have become even stronger and more invincible, and are more capable of winning than ever before. Although the American imperialists have deployed 500,000 troops equipped with the most modern weapons and technology in South Vietnam, and have used dollars to support a large number of puppets and lackeys, they still have no way out. All this shows that in war, the decisive factor is people, and the people who fight a just war and know why they fight are invincible. The continuous "escalation" of aggression by the American imperialists can only lead to the "escalation" of failure, loss, and political bankruptcy.

The article warmly acclaims the great victories of the South Vietnamese military and people in the new year, and points out that the great victories achieved by the heroic South Vietnamese military and people clearly demonstrate the indomitable power of the people's war.

The article points out that the American imperialists, who are in a very difficult situation, are hastening to plot the conspiracy of the "peace talks" deception, and are striving to implement the decision of Glassboro, continuing to coordinate their actions with the Soviet revisionists and their friends and allies around the world. Various meetings and talks are being held in London, Moscow, Washington, Belgrade, New Delhi, the Vatican, and the United Nations building to plot conspiracies and tricks against the Vietnamese people.

The article goes on to say that the Vietnamese people understand that the only way to talk to the invaders is with gun barrels.

In the sacred struggle to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country, the Vietnamese people are not alone. The great 700 million Chinese people are reliable and powerful backers of the heroic Vietnamese people. People around the world who love freedom and all revolutionaries are fully supporting the just cause of the Vietnamese people. The Albanian people and their armed forces regard the new offensive launched by the South Vietnamese military and people and the new victories they are achieving as a great contribution to the victory of the revolutionary cause, and once again express brotherly support and internationalist solidarity to the heroic Vietnamese people.

    阿《战士报》热烈祝贺越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年
    英勇的越南人民不可战胜
    美帝国主义和一切帮凶的阴谋诡计必遭彻底失败
    新华社地拉那十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民军机关报《战士报》十五日发表编辑部文章，热烈祝贺越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年。
    文章说，越南南方人民解放武装力量在诞生七周年的时候，变得更加强大，更加坚不可摧，比以往任何时候都更加能够夺取胜利了。美帝国主义者虽然在南越投入了用最现代化武器和技术装备起来的五十万军队，并用美元扶植着一大批傀儡和走狗，但他们仍然毫无出路。这一切说明，战争中决定的因素是人，进行正义战争和认识到为什么而战的人民，是不可战胜的。美帝国主义者不断的侵略“升级”，只能带来失败、损失和政治破产的日益“升级”。
    文章热烈欢呼越南南方军民新春大捷，并指出，英雄的越南南方军民所取得的伟大胜利，清楚地表明了人民战争坚不可摧的威力。
    文章指出，处境十分困难的美帝国主义者，正在加紧策划“和谈”骗局的阴谋，正在竭力推行葛拉斯堡罗的决定，继续协调他们同苏联修正主义者以及他们在全世界的朋友和同盟者的行动。在伦敦、莫斯科、华盛顿、贝尔格莱德、新德里、梵蒂冈和联合国大厦里，正在举行各种会议和会谈，策划反对越南人民的阴谋诡计。
    文章接着说，但是，越南人民懂得，同侵略者说话只能用枪杆子。
    越南人民在解放南方、保卫北方和统一祖国的神圣斗争中不是孤立的。伟大的七亿中国人民，是英雄的越南人民可靠和强大的后盾。世界上爱好自由的人民和一切革命者全力支持越南人民的正义事业。阿尔巴尼亚人民及其武装力量，把越南南方军民发动的新攻势和正在取得的新胜利，看作是对争取革命事业胜利的伟大贡献，并再次向英雄的越南人民表示兄弟般的支持和国际主义的声援。
