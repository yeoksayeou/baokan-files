The Chinese Embassy in Burma has strongly protested the reactionary Burmese government's manipulation of its puppet court to politically persecute eleven patriotic overseas Chinese, including Chen Bofu, who were illegally arrested and sentenced on trumped-up charges.

The note sternly declared that Chen Bofu and the other ten patriotic overseas Chinese are innocent, and that any trial and verdict conducted by the Burmese government's court against them are completely illegal.

The note stated: The Burmese court fabricated that Chen Bofu and others on June 22 last year at the Chinese Girls' School in Rangoon "obstructed teachers from performing their duties" and "disturbed the public," accusing them of violating Burmese laws. This is merely an excuse for the Burmese government to frame patriotic overseas Chinese and carry out political persecution. The fact is that most of the accused were not even present at the scene. This alone is enough to prove that the charges against the patriotic overseas Chinese are completely fabricated and groundless. Your accusations that patriotic overseas Chinese instigated the "portrait incident" are baseless. The numerous facts of the Rangoon incident clearly show that it was you who first attempted to deprive patriotic overseas Chinese of their right to love their motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao. When this unjust act failed, you then used the so-called "portrait incident" as an excuse to organize savage attacks on the Chinese Embassy and patriotic overseas Chinese, killing Chinese aid workers in Burma, massacring a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese, and igniting a frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese wave. Your crimes of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, which aim to destroy Sino-Burmese relations, have been exposed to the people of the world. Your murderous faces have been fully revealed. Now, you are manipulating the court to politically persecute the victims of your anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities in order to shift the blame. This is your foolish wish, which will never succeed.

The note said: On June 26 last year, when the Burmese government's military, police, secret agents, and a large mob surrounded the overseas Chinese students, Chen Bofu and other patriotic overseas Chinese, out of concern for their own children and overseas Chinese students, went to the former overseas Chinese middle school in Rangoon to visit, which was very natural. However, they were immediately beaten by the mob you organized and then illegally arrested and unjustly detained by your military and police under the pretext of being "moved to a safe place." This has been half a year. In prison, they were tortured. The 68-year-old Chen Bofu was beaten to the point of coughing up blood twice. Liu Yingchao was tortured to death in prison. You have committed heinous crimes against the Chinese people, which have not yet been settled. Now, you are instructing your court to fabricate charges, forge evidence, and sentence patriotic overseas Chinese Chen Bofu and others to imprisonment. Your shameless persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese and your eagerness to stage the farce of trying overseas Chinese only show that you are guilty in the face of truth and ironclad facts. Your clumsy attempts to cover up will only further expose your ugly faces.

The note strongly demands that the Burmese government, in accordance with the five stern demands of the Chinese government, immediately stop its anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes, immediately stop the unjust "trial" of innocent patriotic overseas Chinese, and unconditionally release Chen Bofu and the other eleven patriotic overseas Chinese and all illegally arrested patriotic overseas Chinese. Otherwise, the Burmese government must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on February 24, Rangoon: The reactionary Burmese government, through its puppet court, fabricated charges and on February 20 brazenly and unjustly sentenced Chen Bofu and the other eleven patriotic overseas Chinese to imprisonment. This serious political persecution incident is a despicable plot by the reactionary Burmese government, after igniting a frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese wave and committing heinous crimes, to shift the blame and continue to incite anti-China sentiment. However, the reactionary Burmese government's backward actions can only further expose its ugly face as a henchman of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in their anti-China activities.

On that day, Chen Bofu, Yang Laoqing, Chen Tianhuang, Lin Chenglong, Huang Zhongquan, Wen Ping, Wang Lianfa, Wang Sihua, Ruan Yongtang, Zeng Yaru, and Chen Diya, the eleven patriotic overseas Chinese, stood tall and unyielding in the enemy's court, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Burmese patriotic overseas Chinese who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to the socialist motherland.

In the face of the brave struggle of our patriotic overseas Chinese, the reactionary Burmese government was like a cornered beast, panic-stricken. Inside and outside the court, armed soldiers and police were densely packed, plainclothes agents were running around, and only a few relatives of the persecuted overseas Chinese were allowed to attend the trial. As soon as the judge finished reading the poorly written "verdict," Chen Tianhuang immediately protested strongly. At this time, the eleven patriotic overseas Chinese and the relatives present in the courtroom chanted in unison the quotations of Chairman Mao: "Resolutely decide to fight, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." The patriotic overseas Chinese, despite being sentenced to heavy penalties, were fearless, holding their chained hands high, and walking out of the courtroom. They waved to the approximately three hundred patriotic overseas Chinese and Burmese friends gathered outside the courtroom. At this moment, the crowd was indignant, disregarding the threats of the reactionary military police and agents, and everyone raised their fists and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Down with the Burmese reactionary government!" The eleven patriotic overseas Chinese, in the enemy's prison van, continued to sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations.

Chen Bofu and the other eleven patriotic overseas Chinese were arrested and detained during the large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese wave in Burma last June. At that time, the reactionary Burmese government organized a large mob to savagely attack the Chinese Embassy, killing Chinese aid workers in Burma and massacring hundreds of innocent overseas Chinese, committing unprecedented heinous crimes in the history of international relations. The broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese rose up to defend themselves, and Chen Bofu and the other eleven patriotic overseas Chinese bravely and unyieldingly, fearing no sacrifice, firmly defended the dignity of the motherland. After they were illegally arrested by the reactionary Burmese military and police, the reactionary Burmese government instructed fascist thugs to torture them. The 68-year-old Chen Bofu was beaten to the point of coughing up blood twice. Ruan Yongtang was beaten until his body was covered in wounds. However, the eleven patriotic overseas Chinese studied Chairman Mao's works every day in prison, fought bravely and tenaciously, and their struggle against the enemy's attempt to force them to surrender through violence was a shameful failure.

After last October, the reactionary Burmese government again, under the pretext of "disturbing the public" and other trumped-up charges, conducted a so-called "trial" of Chen Bofu and the other eleven innocent overseas Chinese victims. The reactionary Burmese government used extremely despicable means, hiring a large number of so-called "witnesses" to testify. However, lies can never cover up the truth. Our patriotic overseas Chinese's righteous denunciation turned the enemy's court into a place that exposed the reactionary Burmese government's anti-China ugliness.

Patriotic overseas Chinese Yang Laoqing declared passionately: "I love Chairman Mao, I love Mao Zedong Thought, I love my motherland. Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts and in the hearts of revolutionary people around the world. I have always been working to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Burma. I am innocent. This illegal trial is completely political persecution."

The patriotic overseas Chinese's brave struggle in the enemy's court demonstrated the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and defended the dignity of the great motherland. They are excellent sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and excellent examples for all overseas Chinese.

The reactionary Burmese government is deluded and sliding further down the path of anti-China actions, and will inevitably face severe historical punishment and hasten its own doom.

    我驻缅使馆强烈抗议缅甸反动政府非法判处爱国华侨徒刑
    缅甸政府必须停止反华立即释放爱国华侨
    爱国华侨在敌人法庭上齐声背诵毛主席语录同缅甸反动派展开英勇斗争
    新华社二十四日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二十二日照会缅甸外交部，强烈抗议缅甸奈温反动政府操纵其御用法庭，对被非法逮捕的陈伯甫等十一名爱国华侨进行政治迫害，并以莫须有的罪名判处他们徒刑。
    照会严正声明，陈伯甫等十一位爱国华侨是无罪的，缅甸政府操纵法庭对他们进行的审判和作出的任何判决都是完全非法的。
    照会说：缅甸法庭胡说什么陈伯甫等人去年六月二十二日在仰光中国女中“妨碍教员执行职务”“惊扰群众”等，诬陷他们触犯了缅甸法律。这是缅甸政府蓄意嫁罪爱国华侨，进行政治迫害的借口。事实是陈伯甫等大部分人当时根本不在场。仅此一点就足以表明你们加给爱国华侨的“罪名”完全是虚构的，是根本不能成立的。你们在审判中口口声声指责爱国华侨挑起了什么“像章事件”，而仰光事件的无数事实恰恰证明是你们自己首先妄图剥夺爱国华侨热爱祖国和热爱伟大领袖毛主席的正当权利。当你们的这一无理行动不能得逞时，你们又继而以所谓“像章事件”为借口，一手组织了对中国大使馆和爱国华侨的野蛮袭击，杀死中国援缅工作人员，血腥屠杀大批爱国华侨，掀起疯狂的反华排华高潮。你们蓄意反华排华，破坏中缅关系的罪行已暴露在全世界人民面前，你们的杀人凶犯的丑恶面目已暴露无遗。现在，你们操纵法庭，对在反华排华暴行中的受害者进行政治迫害以达到转嫁罪责的卑鄙目的。这是你们的痴心妄想，是绝对办不到的。
    照会说：去年六月二十六日缅甸政府军、警、特务和大批暴徒围困华侨学生时，爱国华侨陈伯甫等出于对自己子女和爱国华侨学生的关怀，前往仰光前华侨中学探望是很自然的，但当场遭到你们所组织的暴徒的殴打，随后又被你们的军警以“转移到安全地方”为借口非法逮捕和无理扣押，迄今已达半年之久。在狱中，他们遭到严刑拷打。六十八岁的老人陈伯甫在你们拷打下两次咯血。刘应超在狱中被你们迫害致死。你们对中国人民已经犯下了滔天大罪，迄今尚未清算，现在你们又进而指使你们的法庭，捏造罪名，伪造罪证，判处爱国华侨陈伯甫等十一人徒刑。你们这样肆无忌惮地迫害爱国华侨，这样迫不及待地上演审判华侨的丑剧，只表明在真理和铁的事实面前，你们作贼心虚。你们这种欲盖弥彰的拙劣手法必将进一步暴露你们的丑恶嘴脸。
    照会强烈要求缅甸政府根据中国政府的五项严正要求，立即停止反华排华罪行，立即停止对无辜爱国华侨的无理“审讯”，无条件释放陈伯甫等十一名爱国华侨和一切被非法逮捕的爱国华侨，否则缅甸政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
    据新华社二十四日讯　仰光消息：缅甸反动政府通过其御用法庭，虚构罪名，二十日悍然无理宣判陈伯甫等十一名爱国华侨徒刑。这次严重的政治迫害事件，是缅甸反动政府在掀起了疯狂的反华排华浪潮犯下滔天罪行之后，作贼心虚，妄图转嫁罪责、继续煽动反华的卑鄙阴谋。但是，缅甸反动政府的倒行逆施，只能进一步向全世界人民暴露它充当美帝、苏修反华帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。
    二十日这天，陈伯甫、杨老清、陈天煌、林成隆、黄忠泉、温平、王连发、王思华、阮咏棠、曾亚如、陈甸育等十一名爱国华侨，在敌人的法庭上，大义凛然，坚强不屈，充分表现了缅甸爱国华侨无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于社会主义祖国的英雄气概。
    在我爱国华侨的英勇斗争面前，缅甸反动政府如临大敌，恐慌万状。法庭内外，荷枪实弹的军警密布，便衣特务上窜下跳，只许少数被害华侨家属出席旁听。当法官刚刚读完拙劣拼凑的“判决书”时，爱国华侨陈天煌立即提出强烈抗议。这时，十一名爱国华侨和在场家属齐声背诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”爱国华侨们被判重刑，毫无惧色，昂首阔步，走出法庭。他们高举被铐的双手，向聚集在法庭门外的约三百名爱国华侨和缅甸朋友，招手致意。这时，群情激愤，不顾反动军警特务的威胁，大家一同振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒缅甸反动派！”十一名爱国华侨，在敌人的囚车里，仍不断高唱毛主席语录歌。
    陈伯甫等十一名爱国华侨，是去年六月缅甸反动政府大规模反华排华的逆流中，被逮捕和拘押的。当时，缅甸反动政府组织大批暴徒，野蛮袭击中国大使馆，杀死中国援缅工作人员，血腥屠杀数百名无辜华侨，犯下了国际关系史上罕见的滔天罪行。广大爱国华侨奋起自卫，陈伯甫等十一名爱国华侨英勇不屈，不怕牺牲，坚决维护祖国的尊严。在他们被缅甸反动军警无理逮捕之后，缅甸反动政府指使法西斯暴徒对他们进行严刑拷打。六十八岁的老人陈伯甫被打得两次吐血。阮咏棠被打得遍体鳞伤。但是，十一名爱国华侨，在狱中每天学习毛主席著作，英勇顽强，坚持斗争。敌人企图用武力迫使他们屈服的阴谋，遭到了可耻的失败。
    去年十月以后，缅甸反动政府又以“惊扰群众”等莫须有的罪名，对陈伯甫等十一名无辜受害华侨进行所谓“审讯”。缅甸反动政府采用极其卑劣的手段，雇佣了大批所谓“证人”出庭“作证”。但是，谎言终究掩盖不了真理。我爱国华侨义正词严的痛斥，把敌人的法庭，实际上变成了暴露缅甸反动政府反华丑态的场所。
    爱国华侨杨老清慷慨激昂地声明：“我热爱毛主席，我热爱毛泽东思想，我热爱我的祖国。毛主席是我们和世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。我一直在为促进中缅两国人民的友好而工作。我是无罪的。这场非法审讯完全是一场政治迫害。”
    爱国华侨在敌人法庭上的英勇斗争，显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的威力，捍卫了伟大祖国的尊严。他们是中华民族的好儿女，是全体海外华侨的好榜样。
    缅甸反动政府执迷不悟，在反华的道路上越滑越远，终将遭到历史的严厉惩罚，加速自己的灭亡。
