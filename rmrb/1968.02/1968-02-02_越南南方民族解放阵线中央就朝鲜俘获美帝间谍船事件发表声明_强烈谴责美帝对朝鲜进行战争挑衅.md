The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on the capture of the U.S. armed spy ship "Pueblo" by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The statement strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' war provocations against Korea.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, January 31st - According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on January 30th regarding the capture of the U.S. armed spy ship "Pueblo" by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The statement fully supports the just stance taken by the Korean government in its statement on January 27th.

The statement points out: "On January 23, 1968, the armed spy ship 'Pueblo' carried out provocative actions in the territorial waters of North Korea, which was a blatant violation of the independence and sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is part of the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to prepare for a new war of aggression against Korea. It grossly violates the Korean Armistice Agreement and seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world."

The statement says: "The Korean people have the right to take all necessary self-defense measures against the unforgivable acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism. No matter how much military pressure the U.S. imperialists exert or how much they play tricks in the United Nations, they cannot cover up or justify their exposed acts of aggression, nor can they intimidate the heroic Korean people." The statement says: "The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front are particularly concerned about the serious situation caused by U.S. imperialism in Korea and strongly condemn the hostile conspiracies and actions of war provocation and blackmail against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by U.S. imperialism."

The statement finally expresses: "The military and people of South Vietnam are determined to further promote their sacred struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, to deal heavier blows to the U.S. aggressors, to thoroughly defeat their war of aggression, and to actively contribute to the just struggle of the brotherly Korean people to defend their national honor and sovereignty."

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央就朝鲜俘获美帝间谍船事件发表声明
    强烈谴责美帝对朝鲜进行战争挑衅
    新华社河内三十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会三十日就朝鲜民主主义人民共和国俘获美国武装间谍船“普韦布洛号”事件发表声明，表示完全支持朝鲜政府在一月二十七日的声明中所采取的正义立场。
    声明指出：“一九六八年一月二十三日，‘普韦布洛号’武装间谍船在北朝鲜领海的挑衅行动，是明目张胆地侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国独立和主权的非法行动，是美帝国主义准备向朝鲜发动新的侵略战争的阴谋的组成部分。它粗暴地违反了朝鲜停战协定，严重地威胁着亚洲和世界和平。”
    声明说：“朝鲜人民完全拥有采取一切坚决的自卫措施反对美帝国主义的不可饶恕的侵略行动的正当权利。美帝国主义无论是施加军事压力或在联合国耍无赖，都无法给它被当场揭穿的侵略行动进行掩盖和辩解，也绝不能吓倒英雄的朝鲜人民。”声明说：“越南南方人民和民族解放阵线特别关心美帝国主义在朝鲜造成的严重局势，强烈谴责美帝国主义对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国采取的战争挑衅和战争讹诈的敌对阴谋和行动。”
    声明最后表示：“越南南方军民决心进一步促进自己神圣的抗美救国斗争，给美国侵略者以更沉重的打击，彻底打败它的侵略战争，为兄弟的朝鲜人民维护自己民族的荣誉和自己祖国主权的正义斗争作出积极贡献。”
