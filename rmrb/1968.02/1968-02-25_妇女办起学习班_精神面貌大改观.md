More than 90% of the women in our brigade have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. After a period of study and self-criticism to combat selfishness and criticize revisionism, they have changed their old habits of "sitting on the kang, gossiping," and now everyone is concerned about national affairs and loves the collective.

Women's Study Classes Transform Spiritual Outlook

Fanzhuangzi Brigade, Caogoupu Commune, Yuxian County, Hebei Province

Our Fanzhuangzi Brigade is a small mountain village with only 42 households. With boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the sisters started Mao Zedong Thought women's study classes in November last year.

Our study classes use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, "combat selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the main theme, and the "Three Articles" as weapons. We use self-education methods, combine theory with practice, and conduct self-criticism to combat selfishness and criticize revisionism. After a period of study, we have changed the old habits of women "sitting on the kang, gossiping, raising pigs and chickens, and taking care of children" without caring about politics. Mao Zedong Thought has occupied our home front and guided everything we do. We deeply feel that whether or not to run a good study class is indeed a matter of attitude towards Chairman Mao and a matter of loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought.

Our study classes are led by more than 20 active members who use the "one helps two" method to help women with difficulties solve practical problems, gradually expanding the team. For example, they let the older children stay at home or have the older children take care of the younger ones. If they really can't leave, they bring the children to participate in the study. In this way, more than 90% of the women in the village have joined the study classes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." To quickly raise the class consciousness of the sisters, the study classes started by first focusing on class education and the struggle between the two lines. We recall the bitterness of the old society and talk about the sweetness of the new society, criticizing the fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" by the Chinese Khrushchev; we recall the bitterness of individual farming and talk about the sweetness of the commune, criticizing the fallacies of "self-reliance, self-management, self-sufficiency, and freedom in four aspects" by the Chinese Khrushchev. This approach has been very effective. The sisters have a deeper love for Chairman Mao and further aroused their hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev.

"A sharp knife needs sharpening, or it will rust; a person needs self-criticism, or they will become revisionist." According to Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "combat selfishness and criticize revisionism," after the women's consciousness has been raised, we turned to personal "exposure of selfishness" and "combat selfishness," conducting a revolution in our deepest thoughts. Everyone is not afraid of being ugly or painful in the process of combating selfishness. Tao Fengying said in her self-criticism: "My husband is the brigade leader, but I always feel that being a cadre is not worth it, first, you earn fewer work points, second, you offend people, and third, you can't take care of the family. To prevent him from being a cadre, I often quarrel with him and cause trouble, making him unenthusiastic about his work. Last autumn, my husband announced to the community members: 'After the fields are clean and the threshing is done, I will hand over my position...' My husband's intention to 'drop the responsibility' is greatly related to me. This is the 'selfishness' at work, a big mistake. Now I understand: if we poor and lower-middle peasants do not become cadres, who will? It's unacceptable to let the ghosts and snakes take power!"

Since the women participated in the study classes, their spiritual outlook has changed greatly compared to the past. Everyone studies and applies Chairman Mao's works actively, emphasizes politics, cares about national affairs, breaks selfishness and establishes public spirit, and loves the collective. The other day, the brigade bought a sick foal. The feeder Zhang Shenghe found it inconvenient to feed it collectively, so he took it home to feed. His wife Zhu Meiling agreed wholeheartedly. She boiled porridge for the little horse to drink during the day and took careful care of it at night. The little horse was soon nursed back to health. The community members praised Zhu Meiling for her love for the collective. She said, "This is all thanks to the Mao Zedong Thought study class being well run."

### 妇女办起学习班  精神面貌大改观

    我们大队百分之九十以上的妇女参加了毛泽东思想学习班，经过一段学习，斗私批修，改变了过去“坐炕头，拉闲话”的旧习惯，人人都关心国家大事，热爱集体。
    妇女办起学习班  精神面貌大改观
    河北蔚县草沟堡公社樊庄子大队妇代会
    我们樊庄子大队，是个只有四十二户人家的小山村。姐妹们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情，在去年十一月份办起了毛泽东思想妇女学习班。
    我们的学习班，是以毛主席的最新指示为指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为武器，用自我教育的方法，联系实际，进行斗私批修。经过一段学习，改变了妇女过去“坐炕头、拉闲话、养猪喂鸡、抱娃娃”，不问政治的旧习惯，让毛泽东思想占领了我们的家庭阵地，统帅了我们的一切。我们深深体会到：办不办好学习班，的确是一个如何对待毛主席的态度问题，是一个对毛泽东思想忠不忠的问题。
    我们的学习班，由二十多名积极分子作骨干，采取“一帮二带”的方法，帮助有困难的妇女解决实际问题，逐渐扩大了队伍。如让她们把大一点的孩子留在家里，或叫大孩子看小孩子，实在离不开的，就抱着孩子来参加学习。就这样，全村百分之九十以上的妇女都参加到学习班里来了。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”为了使姐妹们很快提高阶级觉悟，学习班一开始，我们就先抓了阶级教育和两条路线斗争教育。忆旧社会的苦，谈新社会的甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的谬论；忆单干的苦，谈公社化的甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”的谬论。这样做的效果很好，姐妹们从心眼里更加热爱毛主席，进一步激发了对中国赫鲁晓夫的千仇万恨。
    “快刀不磨要生锈，人不斗私要变修”。我们按照毛主席“斗私，批修”的最新指示，在妇女思想觉悟有了提高的基础上，又转向个人“亮私”和“斗私”，在自己的思想深处闹革命。大家在斗“私”中不怕丑，不怕痛。陶凤英在斗“私”中说：“我男人是队长，可是，我总觉得当干部不合算，一是挣工分少，二是得罪人，三是顾不了家。我为了不叫他当干部，就常和他吵架、闹别扭，使他在工作上不安心。去年秋天，我男人向社员们声明：‘地净场光以后，我这队长就交班……。’我男人想‘撂挑子’和我有很大关系，这是‘私’字作怪，是个很大错误。现在我懂得了：咱贫下中农不当干部，让谁当？叫牛鬼蛇神掌权还了得！”学习以后，陶凤英真的变了，不仅不和男人吵架了，还常鼓励男人好好工作，掌好权、用好权，全心全意为贫下中农挑重担。
    自从妇女参加学习班学习以后，精神面貌和过去可大不一样了。人人活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，关心国家大事，破私立公，热爱集体。前些日子队里买了一头病马驹，饲养员张盛和觉着集中喂养不方便，便牵到家里去喂。他爱人朱美玲满心同意，她白天给小马驹熬稀粥喝，晚上还精心照管，小马驹不多久就养好了。社员们夸奖朱美玲爱集体，她却说：“这全靠毛泽东思想学习班办得好。”
