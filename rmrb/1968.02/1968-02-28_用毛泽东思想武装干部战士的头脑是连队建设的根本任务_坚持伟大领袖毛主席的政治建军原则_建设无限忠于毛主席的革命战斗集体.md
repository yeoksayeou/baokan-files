The fundamental task of platoon building is to arm the minds of cadres and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought. We must adhere to the political principles of building the army as advocated by the great leader Chairman Mao, and build a revolutionary fighting collective that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

The Shenyang Military Region recently convened a meeting of advanced platoon cadres to exchange new experiences in creating "Four Good" platoons and strengthening revolutionary construction in the new situation. Some people say: "Executing political tasks will naturally lead to the ideological revolutionization of people." This view is incorrect.

Executing political tasks only provides favorable conditions for the ideological revolutionization of people, but it is not the revolutionization of ideology itself.

Advanced ideology, revolutionary ideology, and public-minded ideology do not arise spontaneously. The bourgeoisie's "self" will not disappear on its own, and the proletariat's "public" cannot grow on its own. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers must, through struggle and practice, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, consciously engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, and wage an offensive battle on the ideological front to spark a revolution in their souls and achieve ideological revolutionization. — Editor

New China News Agency, Shenyang, February 27 — After the evaluation of the "Four Good" platoons, the Shenyang Military Region recently convened dozens of cadres from advanced platoons to widely exchange new experiences in creating "Four Good" platoons and strengthening revolutionary construction in the new situation. The attendees unanimously agreed that in the new situation of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the fundamental core of platoon revolutionary construction is to arm the soldiers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought, cultivate soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and build the platoon into a fighting collective that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To achieve this, the key is to adhere to the "Gutian" path, adopt an offensive posture, promote a revolutionary style of learning, and vigorously guide the soldiers to revolutionize their souls and strengthen ideological revolutionization.

Adhering to the "Gutian" path and emphasizing proletarian politics is the fundamental driving force for guiding soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls.

The experience of many platoons has shown that the most important and fundamental aspect of platoon ideological revolutionization construction is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance along the "Gutian" path, implement the principle of political construction of the army, and emphasize the proletarian political direction. In the exchange of experiences, everyone mentioned that when they first carried out the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks, some platoons had confused ideas about the revolutionary construction of the army in the new situation, thinking that "executing political tasks is to emphasize politics" and "platoons will naturally become revolutionary while completing political tasks." Therefore, some cadres relaxed the revolutionary construction of the platoons, and some soldiers neglected their own worldview transformation, only focusing on transforming others' souls and not their own. They brought this new problem to the study and application of "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," launched a big discussion on "How to Strengthen Self-Revolutionization While Executing Political Tasks," and launched a big criticism of the bourgeois line of military construction. This raised their awareness of the importance of emphasizing political construction in the new situation and further recognized that political construction is a consistent idea of Chairman Mao and the fundamental principle of our army's construction. Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's teachings, proposed a series of policies and principles for emphasizing political construction, such as actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, promoting the three-eighths style, developing the three great democracies, and carrying out the "Four Good" platoon movement. These are the direction of our army's construction. Regardless of the tasks executed, the environment, the situation, or the difficulties faced, we must grasp this fundamental principle and adhere to this direction. Only by continuing to implement these policies and principles can we successfully complete the political tasks of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, in the process of carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks, we must consciously emphasize politics and, in the process of helping others become revolutionary, consciously emphasize our own revolutionary construction. Only by focusing all efforts, strengths, and methods on deeply planting the roots of Mao Zedong Thought can we truly achieve the use of Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, transform everything, and promote everything. In a year of practice, many platoons have felt that people's ideological revolutionization can only be achieved through emphasizing politics, not through emphasizing tasks; it can only be consciously achieved, not naturally. Emphasizing politics is the fundamental driving force for guiding soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls. Only by emphasizing politics can we touch the soul and promote soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls and achieve ideological revolutionization.

Adopting an offensive posture and seizing the initiative is the most active attitude for guiding soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "There has never been dust that automatically disappears without being swept away." Comrade Lin Biao instructs us that pure defense is not enough; we must take the initiative to attack. The attendees believe that to eliminate the "self" in one's mind and establish the "public," one must wage an offensive battle. The "self" in people's minds will not disappear on its own, and the "public" will not grow on its own; both require struggle. Without struggle, there is no "public," and without struggle, there is no "loyalty." The Party branch must grasp the ideological revolutionization of the platoon according to Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, adopt an offensive posture to sweep away all non-proletarian thoughts. The offensive posture is a posture of criticism, struggle, and advancement. Only by adopting an offensive posture, actively opening up battlefields, proactively seeking opportunities for struggle, and continuously expanding the fruits of victory can we effectively guide soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls.

Practice has proven that in revolutionary construction, the faster and higher the level of revolution in the souls of the platoons that adopt an offensive posture, the greater the victory. The higher the offensive posture, the greater the revolutionary achievements. The great leap in revolutionization of a certain division's Fourth Platoon illustrates this problem. Originally, the Party branch of this platoon did not adopt an offensive posture in grasping revolutionary construction, always feeling that there were no new targets for self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and nothing to do. Later, through the study of Chairman Mao's works, they realized that "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." To achieve this transformation, one must adopt an offensive posture to engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, promoting cadres and soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls. Each offensive sparks a revolution in the soul; continuous offensives spark continuous revolutions in the soul. Only through one revolution after another can the fundamental transformation of worldview be completed. Based on this understanding, they actively opened up battlefields for self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, proactively sought opportunities for self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and continuously expanded the fruits of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. With a proactive offensive posture, they pushed the ideological revolution to the depths of each person's soul. In one year, they launched ten small self-criticism and criticism of revisionism campaigns, organizing one campaign, deeply touching one soul, sparking one revolution, and achieving one leap. In practice, they felt that old targets, when frequently hit, become new, the soul is touched deeper each time, repetition leads to gradual change, and gradual change leads to leaps. A great change in battle posture leads to a great change in spiritual appearance. In this year, this platoon leaped from being backward to being advanced. Many platoons have similar experiences: to grasp the ideological revolutionization of the platoon, one must be proactive in offense, continuous in offense, and always in offense. Only by continuously attacking the bourgeois "self" can the proletarian "public" in one's mind continuously grow, and one can be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Some comrades say: "If the 'public' is relaxed, the 'self' will attack. It attacks you unknowingly, but you must attack it consciously. The string of self-criticism and criticism of revisionism must be pulled tighter and more frequently, and the revolution in the depths of the soul will spark faster and greater."

How to fight a good offensive battle? The common experience of many platoons is:

First, focus on class education. In education, emphasize the pain of the proletariat's lack of power, the happiness of having power, the importance of holding power, the danger of losing power, the responsibility of protecting power, and concentrate class consciousness on the "power" issue, implementing it in infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, thereby generating a strong desire to spark a revolution in the depths of the soul.

Second, focus on the "line" and "thread" of active thoughts. Active thoughts are the reflection of worldview in specific issues, the manifestation of the "self" in the depths of the soul, and the performance of the "self" in actual problems. "There is no melon that does not grow on a vine, and there is no active thought that is not connected to 'view'." By grasping the "line" and "thread" of active thoughts, one grasps the key to be blown up and the big enemy to be eliminated, and can break down big "self" and establish big "public." Experience has proven that "education without active thoughts is empty coming and going, just going through the motions." Only by focusing on the "line" and "thread" of active thoughts and waging a big offensive battle can one raise line consciousness, keep up with the new situation of class struggle, keep up with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and stand firm, withstand tests, and be strong in any situation.

Promoting a revolutionary style of learning and using the rectification method is the best way to guide soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In such a situation, if we do not carry out a universal Marxist educational movement, that is, a rectification movement, can we still advance smoothly?" He also clearly points out: "... In many years of revolutionary practice, we have derived the method of rectification, and the current socialist self-education movement has once again proven the correctness of this method." The experience of many platoons strongly demonstrates that promoting a revolutionary style of learning and using the small rectification method to guide soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls is the best method. Everyone believes that using the small rectification method to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and link up with reality is the most closely connected and concentrated in solving problems. Combining revolutionary criticism with small rectification, combining self-criticism with criticism of revisionism, deeply carrying out "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism small rectification," and using the spirit of rectification to promote soldiers to spark a revolution in their souls will accelerate the achievement of ideological revolutionization.

Practice has proven that those who combine self-criticism with criticism of revisionism, and combine line struggle education with solving real thoughts, all touch the soul, spark a big revolution, raise awareness quickly, and keep up with the situation well. They have deeply felt that only by combining self-criticism with criticism of revisionism can self-criticism have a high level and criticism of revisionism have depth. Self is the breeding ground for revisionism, and revisionism is the evil fruit of self. Without criticizing revisionism, one cannot see the harm of self, and without self-criticism, one cannot uproot the roots of revisionism. Only by combining self-criticism with criticism of revisionism can one spark a revolution in the depths of the soul, transform the worldview, and accelerate ideological construction.

How to combine self-criticism with criticism of revisionism? The experience of many platoons is: criticize revisionism closely combined with self-criticism, and self-criticism closely combined with criticism of revisionism. Criticize revisionism closely combined with self-criticism, that is, closely follow the situation of class struggle, starting from the actual situation of the army, choose a topic for criticizing revisionism, and in the process of criticizing revisionism, consciously link up with thoughts and combine with self-criticism; criticize once, consciously eliminate the influence of revisionism once, and fiercely criticize self-interest once. Everyone says, this is "the bullet hits China's Khrushchev, and the roots of Mao Zedong Thought are planted in one's own heart," "political immunity increases by one part, and ideological revolutionization advances by one step." Self-criticism closely combined with criticism of revisionism is to expose one's own self-interest, find the influence of revisionism, think about Chairman Mao's teachings, and look at the harm of development. In short, self-criticism must be raised to the height of the struggle between the two lines, criticism of revisionism must touch one's own soul, and through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, spark a revolution in the depths of the soul, and be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, forever following Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: to mobilize the masses, let the masses themselves rise up in revolution, educate themselves, manage themselves, and liberate themselves. Many platoons, in the process of promoting revolutionary learning style and carrying out "small rectification," all regard adhering to and implementing Chairman Mao's mass line as a fundamental direction issue. They have felt from practice that promoting the spirit of rectification and carrying out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism small rectification activities must rely on the self-revolutionary spirit of soldiers' conscious revolution, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide soldiers to expose their own thoughts, find their own problems, find their own weapons, ask for their own reinforcements, and dig up their own roots. They seriously carry out self-criticism.

    用毛泽东思想武装干部战士的头脑是连队建设的根本任务
    坚持伟大领袖毛主席的政治建军原则
    建设无限忠于毛主席的革命战斗集体
    沈阳部队召开先进连队干部会议，交流在新形势下创造四好连队、加强革命化建设的新经验
    有人说：“执行政治任务，就会自然而然地实现人的思想革命化。”这种观点是不正确的。
    执行政治任务，只是提供了实现人的思想革命化的有利条件，但还不是思想革命化本身。
    先进的思想，革命的思想，为公的思想，不能自发地产生。资产阶级的“私”字不会自消自灭，无产阶级的“公”字不能自生自长。广大工农兵群众只有在斗争实践中，活学活用毛泽东思想，自觉地斗私批修，在思想战线上打进攻战，才能在灵魂深处爆发革命，实现思想革命化。——编者
    新华社沈阳二十七日电　人民解放军沈阳部队在四好连队总评以后，最近召集几十个先进连队的干部，广泛交流了在新形势下创造四好连队，加强革命化建设的新经验。到会同志一致认为，在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的新形势下，连队革命化建设根本的根本，核心的核心，就是用毛泽东思想武装战士的头脑，培养无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的坚强战士，把连队建设成为无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗集体。要做到这一点，关键的关键，是坚持“古田”的道路，采取进攻的姿态，发扬革命的学风，大力引导战士在灵魂深处闹革命，加强思想革命化。
    坚持“古田”的道路，突出无产阶级政治，是引导战士在灵魂深处爆发革命的根本动力
    许多连队的经验证明：连队思想革命化建设最重要最根本的，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着“古田”的道路前进，贯彻政治建军的原则，坚持突出无产阶级的政治方向。大家在交流经验中谈到，开始执行“三支”“两军”任务的时候，有的连队对在新形势下部队的革命化建设曾经有过糊涂观念，认为“执行政治任务，就是突出政治”，“连队在完成政治任务中，自然会革命化”，因此，有的干部放松了连队革命化的建设，有的战士忽视了自己世界观的改造，只在触及别人的灵魂上下功夫，不在触及自己的灵魂上下功夫。他们带着这个新问题活学活用《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，开展“在执行政治任务中如何加强自身革命化建设？”的大讨论，开展对资产阶级建军路线的大批判，提高了对新形势下着重政治建军重要意义的认识，进一步认识到政治建军是毛主席的一贯思想，是我军建设的根本。林副主席根据毛主席的教导，提出的活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，是我军建设的方向。不论执行什么任务，处在什么环境，遇到什么情况，面临什么困难，都要抓住这个根本，坚持这个方向。只有继续狠抓这些方针原则的落实，才能圆满完成在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的政治任务。因此，在执行“三支”“两军”任务的过程中，一定要自觉地突出政治，在帮助别人革命化的过程中，一定要自觉地突出自身革命化建设。只有把一切功夫，一切力量，一切办法都用在深扎毛泽东思想根子上，才能真正实现用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切。在一年的实践中，许多连队都体会到：人的思想革命化，只能靠突出政治“化”，不能靠突出任务“化”；只能自觉地“化”，不能自然地“化”；突出政治是引导战士在灵魂深处爆发革命的根本动力。只有突出政治，才能触及灵魂，推动战士在灵魂深处爆发革命，实现思想革命化。
    采取进攻的姿态，争取主动，是引导战士在灵魂深处爆发革命最积极的态度
    毛主席教导我们：“从来没有不经过打扫而自动去掉的灰尘。”林副主席指示我们，单纯的防御不行，要主动地进攻。到会的同志认为，要在头脑里破私立公，就要打进攻战。人们头脑里的“私”字不能自消自灭，“公”字不能自生自长，都要经过斗争。不斗不出“公”，不斗不出“忠”。党支部抓连队思想革命化，一定要按照毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示办事，以进攻的姿态去扫除一切非无产阶级思想。进攻的姿态，就是批判的姿态，斗争的姿态，前进的姿态。只有采取进攻的姿态，积极开辟战场，主动寻找战机，连续扩大战果，才能有力地引导战士在灵魂深处爆发革命。
    实践证明：在革命化建设中，哪个连队采取了进攻的姿态，哪个连队在灵魂深处爆发革命的速度就快，水平就高，胜利就大。进攻的姿态越高，革命的成果越大。某部四连革命化的大飞跃，就说明了这个问题。原来这个连的党支部抓革命化建设不是进攻的姿态，总觉得斗私批修没有新靶子，没搞头。后来经过学习毛主席著作，他们认识到“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。要实现这个转变，就要以进攻的姿态斗私批修，促进干部战士在灵魂深处爆发革命。进攻一次，就能触及一次灵魂，爆发一次革命；连续进攻，就能连续触及灵魂，连续爆发革命。只有经过一次一次的革命，才能完成世界观的根本转变。根据这个认识，他们积极地开辟斗私批修的战场，主动地寻找斗私批修的战机，连续地扩大斗私批修的战果，以主动进攻的姿态把思想革命推进到了每个人的灵魂深处，在一年中，他们展开了十次斗私批修小会战，组织一次会战，深触一次灵魂，爆发一次革命，出现一次飞跃。在实践中，他们感觉到：老靶子常打常新，灵魂越触越深，有重复才有渐变，有渐变才有飞跃。战斗姿态大转变，精神面貌大转变，在这一年里，这个连队由后进一跃为先进。许多连队都有这样的体会：抓连队思想革命化，一要主动进攻，二要连续进攻，三要永远进攻。只有不断地向资产阶级“私”字进攻，自己头脑里的无产阶级的“公”字才能不断增长，才能做到对毛主席无限忠诚。有的同志说：“公”字松一松，“私”字就攻一攻。它攻你常常是不知不觉，你攻它却要高度自觉。斗私批修这根弦拉得越勤越紧，灵魂深处的革命就爆发得越快越大。
    怎样打好进攻仗呢？许多连队的共同经验是：
    一、大抓特抓阶级教育。在教育中，大摆无产阶级无权的痛苦，有权的幸福，掌权的重要，丢权的危险，保权的责任，把阶级觉悟的提高集中到“权”字上，落实到对毛主席的无限忠诚上，从而产生在灵魂深处爆发革命的强烈愿望。
    二、大抓特抓“纲”上“线”上的活思想。活思想是世界观在具体问题上的反映，是灵魂深处“私”字的浮现，是“私”字在实际问题上的表演。“没有一个瓜不结在藤上，没有一个活思想不连在‘观’上”。抓住了“纲”上“线”上的活思想，就抓住了要爆破的要害，要消灭的大敌，就能破大私，立大公。经验证明，“教育离开活思想，空来空去走过场”。只有大抓特抓“纲”上“线”上的活思想，并且大打进攻战，才能提高路线觉悟，才能紧紧跟上阶级斗争的新形势，紧紧跟上毛主席的最新指示，才能在任何情况下，站得稳，顶得住，过得硬。
    发扬革命的学风，运用整风的方法，是引导战士在灵魂深处爆发革命最好的方法
    毛主席教导我们：“在这种情形下，如果不进行一个普遍的马克思主义的教育运动，即整风运动，我们还能顺利地前进吗？”还明确指出：“……在多年的革命实践中，得出了整风的方法，而目前的社会主义自我教育运动又一次说明了这个方法的正确性。”许多连队的经验都有力地说明：发扬革命的学风，运用小整风的方法，引导战士在灵魂深处爆发革命，是最好的方法。大家认为，运用小整风的方法活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，联系实际最紧密，解决问题最集中。把革命大批判和小整风结合起来，把斗私和批修结合起来，深入开展“斗私批修小整风”，以整风的精神来促进战士在灵魂深处爆发革命，就会加速实现思想革命化。
    实践证明：凡是把斗私和批修结合起来进行的，把路线斗争教育和解决现实思想结合起来进行的，都触及灵魂，爆发革命大，觉悟提高快，紧跟形势好。他们深有体会地说：只有斗私和批修相结合，斗私才能有高度，批修才能有深度。私是修的温床，修是私的恶果。不批修就看不清私的危害，不斗私就挖不掉修的根子，只有把斗私和批修结合起来，才能在灵魂深处爆发革命，改造世界观，加速思想建设。
    斗私和批修怎样结合呢？许多连队的经验是：批修紧密结合斗私，斗私紧密结合批修。批修紧密结合斗私，就是紧跟阶级斗争形势，从部队实际出发，选一个批修的题目，在批修中自觉联系思想，结合斗私；批判一次，就自觉地肃清一次修正主义影响，狠斗一次私心。大家说，这是“炮弹打在中国赫鲁晓夫身上，毛泽东思想的根子扎在自己的心上”，“政治免疫力增强一分，思想革命化前进一步”。斗私紧密结合批修，就是亮一亮自己的私心，找一找修正主义的影响，想一想毛主席的教导，看一看发展下去的危害。总之，斗私要提高到两条路线斗争的高度，批修要触及自己的灵魂，通过斗私批修在灵魂深处爆发革命，做到无限忠于毛主席，永远紧跟毛主席。
    毛主席教导我们：要放手发动群众，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己。许多连队发扬革命学风，在开展“小整风”的过程中，都把坚持贯彻毛主席的群众路线当作根本的方向问题来抓。他们从实践中体会到，发扬整风精神，开展斗私批修小整风活动，一定要坚决依靠战士的自觉革命、自我革命精神，用毛泽东思想引导战士自己亮思想，自己摆问题，自己找武器，自己请援兵，自己挖根源，认真开展自我批评。
