In the heroic ancient city of Hue, three massive flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, bearing the golden star on a red and blue background, were once again hoisted high on February 21st amidst the earth-shaking songs of victory. The armed forces of the people of Quang Tri-Thua Thien have, in an incredibly brave 22-day battle to defend Hue, repulsed the enemy's repeated ferocious counterattacks, annihilated a large number of enemy troops, and achieved ever-greater victories.

Following the crushing of the enemy's three-pronged counterattack on February 19th, which resulted in the annihilation of over 200 American and puppet soldiers, the liberation forces launched repeated offensive operations on February 20th, eliminating more than 100 enemy troops. On that same morning, the liberation forces launched a fierce ambush against a company of American invaders attempting to counterattack in the Ben Bo and Ben Phu areas, five kilometers west of Hue, killing over 50 of them. The remaining enemy fled in disarray. Meanwhile, on the right bank of the Perfume River, another group of American invaders had just left the Phu Cam area when they were annihilated by Hue city's self-defense forces, with 20 of them killed. Two enemy military ships on the Perfume River were also sunk by the people's liberation forces, killing a large number of American invaders on board and cutting off the enemy's river supply line. Thus, from February 14th to 20th, the liberation forces annihilated over 1,500 American and puppet soldiers in a week.

By February 22nd, the city remained firmly under the control of the liberation forces. The liberation forces controlled the passage of National Highway 1 to the north of the city, occupied key positions along the inner river from the south to the north of the city, blocked the enemy's water and land transportation, and closely monitored the sky with ground artillery, preventing American helicopters from landing. The enemy's efforts to dispatch reinforcements and supplies were extremely difficult.

During the three weeks of fierce battles to attack and defend this heroic ancient city, tens of thousands of Hue residents, including workers, students, teachers, small traders, and Buddhists, stood up to fight side by side with the liberation forces. Newly organized self-defense units and guerrilla forces were active in every district. Major thoroughfares in the city were fortified with trenches and barricades. The liberated city of Hue had become a vast sea of people's war, drowning the enemy in a sea of destruction.

Despite the enemy's deployment of large numbers of troops and the use of aircraft, artillery, tanks, and even poison gas in their frenzied counterattacks, they could not advance a single step in the face of the iron fists of the heroic people of Hue. The city stood firm, while the enemy paid a heavy price. Western news agencies reported day after day with no hesitation: "The casualties of the U.S. Marine Corps are extraordinarily high," "U.S. forces are being reduced at an astonishing rate every day." It was revealed that the strength of three "elite" paratrooper battalions of the puppet army had been reduced to company size and had to withdraw from the battlefield a week ago. The U.S. Marine Corps' 5th Regiment, 1st Battalion, which was sent to reinforce, fought for nine days, lost half of its strength, and had to withdraw. Under the heavy blows of the people of Hue, the morale of the U.S. invaders plummeted further.

While bravely defending Hue, the liberation forces of Quang Tri-Thua Thien also frequently attacked a series of enemy strongholds, logistics bases, and airfields south of the demilitarized zone, continuing to surround and cut off the enemy's supply lines. Tens of thousands of American invaders were tightly pinned down in this narrow strip of land, facing a very difficult situation.

On February 19th, the liberation forces once again launched heavy artillery barrages on the besieged Khe Sanh U.S. base, Dong Ha enemy airfield, Hill 241, Vung Chua port, and many other enemy strongholds, annihilating over 100 American and puppet soldiers.

At Vung Chua port, the shells of the people's liberation forces accurately hit the American military storage area, setting many warehouses on fire. The flames burned for two hours without stopping. A company of enemy transport troops had just arrived at Vung Chua when they were shelled by the people's liberation forces, with many killed and many wounded. After the Dong Ha airfield was heavily shelled, it was completely paralyzed. Enemy transport planes had just landed on the airfield when they were hit by shells. The command post of the puppet army's 2nd Regiment stationed at Dong Ha was also hit by many shells. The U.S. 175th Artillery Battery on Hill 241 was blown to pieces, and the fuel depot was hit by shells, engulfing the entire position in flames, burning many American invaders to death.

The enemy strongholds of Kon Tum, Co Rock Slope, Yu Temple, Bai Shan, and Nhu Trung also came under attack by the people's liberation forces on February 19th, suffering heavy losses.

Prior to this, on February 15th and 16th, the people's liberation forces ambushed American invaders who had been air-dropped in the Erqiao and Xingren areas of southern Quang Tri Province, killing and wounding 80 of them and shooting down one jet and one helicopter each.

    把敌人拖垮拖死在人民战争大海中
    南越广治—承天军民团结一致坚持战斗围歼敌人有生力量
    新华社河内二十二日电　在英雄的古城顺化市上空，三面巨幅的越南南方民族解放阵线的金星红蓝旗，二十一日又在震撼大地的凯歌声中，高高升起。广治—承天人民解放武装力量，在二十二天无比英勇保卫顺化市的战斗中，击退了敌人的多次猖狂反扑，消灭了敌人大量的有生力量，取得了日益巨大的胜利。
    继十九日粉碎了敌人三路反扑，歼灭美伪军二百多名之后，解放武装力量二十日又频频主动出击，歼敌一百多。当天上午，解放武装力量在顺化市西面五公里的奔池和奔普地区猛烈截击一连妄图反扑的美国侵略军，打死五十多人，残敌狼狈逃窜。与此同时，在香江右岸，另一股美国侵略军刚走出富甘地区，就被顺化市自卫队员消灭二十名。香江河上的两艘敌人军用船只，也被人民解放武装力量击沉，船上的大批美国侵略军被歼，敌人的河上供应线被切断。这样，在从十四日到二十日的一周内，解放武装力量共消灭美伪军一千五百多名。
    到二十二日为止，这座城市仍然处于解放武装力量的牢牢控制之中。解放武装力量控制了城北一号公路的通道，占领了从城南到城北的内河沿线的要害楔形地段，封锁了敌人的水陆交通，并且以严密的地面炮火监视着天空，使美国直升飞机不敢降落。美伪集团调派援兵、输送给养，都十分困难。
    在进攻和保卫这座英雄古城的三周激战的日日夜夜，工人、学生、教师、小商贩以及佛教徒等，成千上万的顺化市居民，奋起同解放武装力量并肩战斗。新组织起来的自卫队和游击队，活跃在各个街区。市内通衢要道上，全修筑起工事和街垒。解放了的顺化市，变成了一片陷敌于灭顶之灾的人民战争的汪洋大海。
    尽管美伪集团出动了大批的军队，使用了飞机、大炮、坦克甚至毒气进行疯狂反扑，但是，在英雄的顺化市军民的铁拳面前，始终不能前进一步，这座钢铁的城市还是巍然屹立，而敌人却付出了极其惨重的代价。西方通讯社连日在报道中毫不隐讳地惊呼：“美国海军陆战队的伤亡异常之大”，“美国兵力每天以惊人的速度削减着”。据透露，伪军的三个“精锐”空降营的兵力已减少到连，不得不在一周前撤离战场。调去增援的美国海军陆战队第五团第一营，打了九天，兵力损失了一半，也只好撤下去。在顺化军民的沉重打击下，美国侵略军的士气更加低落。
    在英勇地保卫顺化市的同时，广治—承天解放武装力量还在非军事区以南，频频进攻敌人的一系列据点、后勤基地和机场，继续包围和切断敌人的供应线。成万的美国侵略军被紧紧地牵制在这块狭窄的地带上，陷于十分困难的处境。
    十九日，解放武装力量再次向被围困的溪山美军基地、东河敌军机场、二四一高地、越门港口以及其它许多敌军据点，进行猛烈炮轰，消灭美伪军一百多名。
    在越门港口，人民解放武装力量的炮弹准确地击中美军仓库地区，许多仓库中弹起火，大火一直燃烧了两小时还不停熄。敌人的运输兵一个连刚开到越门，就遭到人民解放武装力量的炮击，许多人被打死，一大批被打伤。东河机场遭到猛烈的炮轰之后，完全陷于瘫痪。敌人的运输机刚在机场上降落就被炮弹击中。设在东河的伪军第二团指挥部也中了许多发炮弹。二四一高地上的美军一七五炮兵阵地被打得稀烂，汽油库也被炮弹击中，熊熊烈火笼罩着整个阵地，烧死许多美国侵略军。
    昆天、卵石坡、育庙、拜山和尔中等敌军据点在十九日也遭到人民解放武装力量袭击，敌人损失惨重。
    在这以前，十五日和十六日两天，人民解放武装力量在广治省南部儿桥、兴仁地区伏击空投的美国侵略军，打死打伤八十名，击落喷气式飞机和直升飞机各一架。
