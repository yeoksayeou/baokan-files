New Delhi has recently become a hub for U.S. imperialists and their lackeys to gather and plot international conspiracies. They are frantically working to help the U.S. imperialists extricate themselves from their deepening crisis.

The head of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin, arrived in New Delhi on the 25th. News of Kosygin's visit to India had circulated several times last year but did not materialize. Now, he has suddenly decided to visit India, bringing with him a large delegation of thirty people. The head of the Yugoslav traitor clique, Josip Broz Tito, arrived in New Delhi on the 22nd. He initially planned to stay in India for only three days but extended his stay to six days to wait for Kosygin's arrival.

Indian reactionary Prime Minister Indira Gandhi held intense secret talks with Tito for several days and is scheduled to meet with Kosygin and Tito together on the 26th.

It is also noted that another lackey of U.S. imperialism, UN Secretary-General U Thant, will arrive in New Delhi on the 30th.

Behind the activities of these lackeys, one can see the hand of U.S. imperialism.

Kosygin had just sent off British Prime Minister Harold Wilson from a Moscow airport before rushing to India. In their joint communiqué, Kosygin and Wilson blatantly proposed a "political solution" to the "Vietnam War," aiding U.S. imperialism. During the talks between the British and Soviet leaders, U.S. imperialist chief Lyndon Johnson handed a secret letter to Kosygin through his ambassador to the Soviet Union.

Meanwhile, in New Delhi, while Indira Gandhi was in heated discussions with Tito, U.S. Ambassador to India Chester Bowles openly intervened. On the 23rd, he held a secret meeting with Tito, whom he had "known for a long time," for forty-five minutes.

Then, an Indian reactionary government spokesman announced on the 23rd, after the talks between Indira Gandhi and Tito, that the Vietnam issue was "a topic of full and thorough exchange of views." He openly declared that these two U.S. lackeys were eager to further serve the U.S. imperialists' "bombing halt bait" plot. He said that Indira Gandhi and Tito both agreed with UN Secretary-General U Thant's "belief" that "meaningful talks" would be held within three to four weeks of the U.S. stopping its bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This group of demons desperately hopes to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms before achieving final victory.

Reports from Western news agencies and Indian newspapers on the talks between Tito and Indira Gandhi also revealed that the two sides conspired on the issue of jointly countering China. Obviously, after Kosygin's arrival, how to further aid U.S. imperialism in opposing China would be an important agenda item for their three-way conspiracy.

In addition, it is revealed that they will also conspire on a series of international issues, including the full draft of the so-called "non-proliferation treaty" recently jointly proposed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, to serve the interests of U.S. imperialism.

    替美帝侵越出谋效力　为共同反华加紧勾结
    一群美帝帮凶走卒聚会新德里
    据新华社二十六日讯　新德里消息：印度首都新德里这几天成了美帝国主义的一些帮凶和走卒们聚会和策划国际阴谋的场所。他们紧张地为帮助美帝国主义摆脱愈陷愈深的危机而奔忙。
    苏联修正主义领导集团头目、苏联部长会议主席柯西金二十五日到达新德里。柯西金到印度活动的消息，去年就曾传出过几次，一直没有成行。现在他突然作出了访印的决定，并且带去了一个三十人的庞大代表团。南斯拉夫叛徒集团头子铁托在二十二日就到了新德里。他本来计划只在印度逗留三天，后来临时作出决定，把他在印度的活动延长到六天，等候柯西金的到来。
    印度反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地在同铁托紧张地密谈了几天之后，预定在二十六日同柯西金和铁托一起会面。
    人们还注意到，美帝国主义的另一名走卒、联合国秘书长吴丹也将在三十日到新德里去。
    在这些帮凶、走卒们的活动后面，都可以看到美帝国主义的黑手。
    柯西金是刚刚把英国首相威尔逊从莫斯科的一个机场上送走之后就赶到印度去的。柯西金和威尔逊在他们的联合公报上，露骨地提出要搞什么“越南战争”的“政治解决”，替美帝国主义帮忙。就在英苏头目会谈期间，美帝国主义头子约翰逊通过他的驻苏大使把一封密信交给柯西金。
    和这同时，在新德里，当英迪拉·甘地同铁托谈得热火的时候，美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯也公开插手。他在二十三日同他“早就认识了的”铁托密谈了四十五分钟。
    然后，印度反动政府的发言人二十三日在英迪拉·甘地和铁托会谈后宣布，越南问题是双方“全面充分地交换了意见的一个议题”。他公开宣布这两个美帝走卒急于为美帝的“停炸诱和”阴谋进一步效劳。他说，英迪拉·甘地和铁托都同意联合国秘书长吴丹的“信念”，即在美国停止轰炸越南民主共和国三、四个星期内就会举行“有意义的会谈”。这群恶魔一心妄想使越南人民在取得最后胜利之前就放下武器。
    西方通讯社和印度报刊关于铁托和英迪拉·甘地的会谈的报道中，还透露出双方密谋了共同反华的问题。显然，在柯西金到达之后，如何进一步帮助美帝国主义反对中国的问题，必将是他们三方密谋的一项重要议程。
    此外，据透露，他们还将在美苏最近合伙抛出的所谓“防止核扩散”条约全面草案等一系列国际问题上，为美帝国主义出谋效力。
