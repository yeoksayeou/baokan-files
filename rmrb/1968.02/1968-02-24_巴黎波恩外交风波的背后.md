The diplomatic talks between France and West Germany, centered around the issue of Britain joining the "Common Market," have concluded. Britain's formal entry into the "Common Market" remains a distant prospect. This reflects West Germany's further alignment with France to resist American pressure.

Before the talks between France and West Germany, under American pressure, West Germany had vigorously pushed for Britain's entry into the "Common Market." In early February, West German Foreign Minister Brandt, in a speech in Ravensburg, attacked France's policy as "a rigid and out-of-step-with-Europe stance of a power-hungry national leader." This remark sparked a minor diplomatic storm. The news reached Paris, and France's semi-official news agency Agence France-Presse immediately relayed it, stating that it was "clearly an allusion to de Gaulle" and that "Brandt had instigated the storm." French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville summoned the West German ambassador on Sunday to demand an explanation. De Gaulle, to express his displeasure, deliberately snubbed West German President Lubke, who was visiting Paris. The West German government, seeing France's strong reaction, had the official news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur retract the report, made the "confused" reporter "resign," and sent Undersecretary of State Werner to Paris to apologize to Couve de Murville on behalf of Brandt, reaffirming "friendship." Brandt himself publicly stated that the Deutsche Presse-Agentur report "completely fabricated" his words, declaring he had never intended to offend the French president. West German Chancellor Kiesinger, who had just returned from a visit to Italy, also expressed "regret" over the matter. After these maneuvers, the French government held a cabinet meeting and announced that it considered the incident "resolved."

The storm has ended, but it placed France in a favorable position during the talks with West Germany.

In the run-up to the talks, the United States exerted significant political and economic pressure on West Germany to support Britain. The U.S. sent Deputy Secretary of State Rostow and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Dimon to visit West Germany, demanding that West Germany purchase U.S. medium-term bonds to offset the costs of U.S. troops stationed in West Germany, and expressing dissatisfaction with West Germany's "value-added tax" measures. However, in the face of the weakening and isolation of U.S. imperialism, the Johnson administration's pressure tactics only made the Bonn government, which was trying to escape political and economic crises, lean more towards France to resist U.S. pressure.

The struggle over Britain's entry into the "Common Market" is essentially a contest for hegemony in Western Europe among imperialist powers. After World War II, the United States, taking advantage of the weakness of Western European countries, controlled Western Europe through the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty. Since the establishment of the "Common Market" in 1958, the economic strength of Western European countries has relatively increased, and their resistance to U.S. control has been growing. Particularly France, openly challenging U.S. hegemony in Europe. To defeat France, the United States, utilizing Britain's desire to return to Western Europe as a leader, strongly supports Britain's bid to join the "Common Market," aiming to continue controlling Western Europe through Britain. France, in turn, rejects this on the grounds that Britain consistently follows the United States. The resurgent West German militaristic forces, nostalgic for their past dominance in Europe, have sharp contradictions with France over who has the right to dominate Western Europe. At the same time, while relying on the United States to achieve its ambition of annexing the German Democratic Republic, it also aligns with France to counter U.S. control. Brandt's speech, filled with resentment towards de Gaulle's European policy, and West Germany's unwillingness to break with France over Britain during the talks, are rooted in these contradictions.

    巴黎波恩外交风波的背后
    晓文
    以英国加入“共同市场”问题为中心的法国和西德的会谈结束了。英国正式加入“共同市场”仍然遥遥无期。这反映了西德正在进一步靠拢法国来抵抗美国的压力。
    在法国和西德会谈之前，西德在美国压力下，曾经为英国加入“共同市场”大卖力气。二月初，西德外交部长勃兰特在拉文斯堡的一次讲话中，就这个问题攻击法国的政策是“一个醉心于权力的国家元首的僵硬的与欧洲格格不入的主张”。这句话引起了一场不大不小的外交风波。消息传到巴黎，法国的半官方通讯社法新社立即转播，说这是“明显地影射戴高乐”的，是“勃兰特挑起了风波”。法国外长德姆维尔在星期日召见西德大使提出责问。戴高乐为了表示他的不满，故意冷淡正在巴黎访问的西德总统吕布克。西德政府看到法国反应强烈，只好责成官方通讯社德新社撤销了那个消息，让“把话弄混了”的记者“辞职”，并派出全德事务部长魏纳代表勃兰特专程到巴黎向德姆维尔道歉，重申“友谊”。勃兰特自己公开声明，德新社的消息“完全捏造”了他的话，表白他从未想得罪法国总统。刚从意大利访问回国的西德总理基辛格，也为这事表示了“遗憾”。经过这样一番周折，法国政府开了一次内阁会议，才宣布说认为事件“已经了结”。
    一场风波结束了。而这场风波却使法国在同西德的会谈中显然处于有利的地位。
    美国为了迫使西德支持英国，在会谈前夕对西德从政治上、经济上施加了强大的压力。美国派出副国务卿罗斯托和财政部副部长但明两名大员访问西德，要西德购买美国中期债券来补偿美国在西德驻军的费用，并且对西德实行“增值税”的措施表示不满。但是，在美帝国主义日益削弱和孤立的情况下，约翰逊政府这种施加压力的做法，反而使正在力图逃避政治经济危机的波恩政府更加向法国靠拢，来抵抗美国的压力。
    围绕着英国加入“共同市场”问题进行的斗争，实质上是帝国主义之间争夺西欧霸权的斗争。第二次大战后，美国利用西欧国家的削弱，通过马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约控制了西欧。一九五八年“共同市场”成立以来，西欧国家的经济实力相对增强，反对美国控制的斗争不断发展。特别是法国，公开同美国争夺欧洲的霸权。美国为了击败法国，利用英国打算回到西欧充当盟主的愿望，竭力支持英国加入“共同市场”的要求，企图通过英国继续控制西欧，而法国也就以英国一贯追随美国为理由，坚决加以拒绝。羽毛日益丰满的西德军国主义势力念念不忘它从前称霸欧洲的日子，它同法国之间在谁有资格称霸西欧的问题上存在着尖锐的矛盾。同时，它一方面为了实现吞并德意志民主共和国的野心，不得不继续依赖美国，另一方面它又靠拢法国，利用法国来反对美国的控制。勃兰特在讲话中对戴高乐的欧洲政策所以具有如此愤懑的情绪，而在同法国的会谈中西德又不愿意为了英国而同法国闹翻，其原因也就在这里。
