The traitorous clique of the Soviet revisionists, headed by Kosygin, rushed to India at the end of last month under the pretext of attending the Indian national celebration. His activities in New Delhi and the already published joint communiqué of the Sino-Indian talks indicate that Kosygin's visit is a new step in the Soviet revisionists' clique's efforts to intensify aid to India against China and to cooperate with U.S. imperialism in expanding the war in Vietnam and actively peddling the "peace talks" fraud.

Kosygin's visit to India soon after the start of the new year was not without reason. Throughout the year 1967, India's political and economic crises deepened, and the people's struggle against hunger and tyranny intensified. In particular, the armed revolutionary struggle of the peasants in Nasalbari dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the Congress Party government. Indian bourgeois newspapers admitted in horror that 1967 was "the worst year in India's twenty years of 'independence,'" and that the Congress Party was "like a ship about to sink." Kosygin's personal visit to India to boost the morale of the reactionary Congress Party government is aimed at keeping this battered ship afloat in the turbulent revolutionary currents and ensuring that the Indian reactionaries continue to serve as a tool of U.S.-Soviet joint anti-China efforts.

The Brezhnev-Kosygin traitorous clique has fully inherited Khrushchev's policy of aiding India against China and has gone even further. In just a few short years since they came to power, they have provided India with nearly double the amount of loans compared to previous years, while also supplying a large quantity of modern weapons to strengthen the Indian reactionaries' military aggression against China. Now, the Soviet revisionist clique has become the largest supplier of military aid to India, and the Soviet Union has become India's second-largest creditor and third-largest trading partner. The Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, is increasingly implementing neo-colonialist slavery and control over India.

During this visit, Kosygin hypocritically declared that the purpose of Soviet-Indian "cooperation" is "not to oppose certain other countries." This is clearly a case of "the thief shouting 'stop thief.'" On the day Kosygin arrived in India, Indian newspapers revealed that, in addition to the 100 Su-7 supersonic fighter-bombers recently delivered by the Soviet revisionists specifically for use against China, more military aid would be provided to meet India's so-called "additional defense needs." At the same time, Western newspapers also revealed that the United States had "suggested" to the Soviet revisionists that they jointly provide "nuclear protection" for India. Kosygin's visit to India is clearly directed against China. The so-called Soviet-Indian "cooperation" that Kosygin advocates is a component of the Soviet revisionists' clique's counter-revolutionary line of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," and it is also a component of U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy.

Kosygin's activities in India coincide with the time when U.S. imperialism is expanding the war in Vietnam and playing new "peace talks" tricks. Before visiting India, Kosygin and British Prime Minister Wilson, after their talks in Moscow, shouted that the "Vietnam conflict" must be "politically resolved." Upon arriving in New Delhi, he conspired with Indian reactionary Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the visiting head of the Yugoslav traitorous clique, Tito, to advocate stopping the bombing, claiming that it would create conditions for negotiations to achieve a political resolution. As U.S. imperialism becomes more and more mired in the Vietnam War quagmire and finds it impossible to extricate itself, Kosygin's frantic activities are obviously aimed at reviving the so-called "two chairmen of the Geneva Conference" and India's so-called "chairman of the International Supervisory Commission for Indochina" to serve U.S. imperialism in salvaging its defeat in Vietnam. Kosygin's activities in New Delhi once again expose the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique in its fake support and real betrayal of the Vietnamese people.

However, all of Kosygin's counter-revolutionary activities are in vain. No matter how hard the Soviet revisionist leadership clique intensifies its efforts to aid India against China, and no matter how eagerly it plots for U.S. imperialism's war in Vietnam, it cannot save the reactionary rule of the Indian Congress Party government, which is already on the verge of collapse, nor can it save U.S. imperialism's total defeat in Vietnam.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique, and their common lackey, the Indian reactionaries, are precisely following this logic towards their doom.

    柯西金到印度去干什么勾当？
    本报评论员
    苏修叛徒集团头目柯西金，上月底以参加印度国庆为名，匆匆忙忙地到印度去跑了一趟。他在新德里的活动和已经发表的苏印会谈联合公报表明：柯西金此行，是苏修叛徒集团加紧援印反华和配合美帝国主义扩大侵越战争、积极推销“和谈”骗局的一个新步骤。
    柯西金在新的一年刚刚开始不久就赶到印度去访问，这不是没有缘故的。去年一年内，印度的政治经济危机不断加深，人民反饥饿、反暴政的斗争日益高涨。特别是纳萨尔巴里农民展开的革命武装斗争，沉重地打击了国大党政府的反动统治。印度资产阶级报纸惊恐地承认：一九六七年是比印度“独立二十年来任何一年都糟糕”的“一个灾难的年头”，国大党就“象一艘即将沉没的船”。柯西金这次亲自出马到印度去给国大党反动政府打气撑腰，就是为了使这条风雨飘摇的破船在汹涌的革命激流中继续挣扎，使印度反动派继续充当美苏联合反华的一个工具。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团全盘继承了赫鲁晓夫援印反华的政策，而且走得更远。他们上台以来的短短几年中，给了印度比以前多近一倍的贷款，同时还供给了大量的现代化武器，以加强印度反动派反对中国的军事侵略力量。现在，苏修集团已成为印度最大的军“援”供应者，苏联变成了印度第二大债权国和第三位贸易国。苏修集团同美帝国主义勾结在一起，对印度步步加紧实行新殖民主义的奴役和控制。
    柯西金在这次访问中假惺惺地表白，苏印“合作”的“目的并不在于反对某些其他国家”。这完全是“此地无银三百两”。在柯西金到达印度的当天，印度报纸就透露，苏修当局除了最近向印度运交专门用来对付中国的一百架苏—7型超音速战斗轰炸机之外，还将提供更多的军事“援助”来满足印度的所谓“额外的国防需要”。与此同时，西方报纸也透露，美国已向苏修集团“建议”联合“给印度以核保护”。柯西金这次印度之行，其矛头明显地是针对中国的。柯西金鼓吹的所谓苏印“合作”，是苏修叛徒集团推行的“美苏合作主宰世界”反革命路线的一个组成部分，也是美帝国主义反革命全球战略的一个组成部分。
    柯西金这次到印度去活动，正是美帝国主义扩大侵越战争、玩弄新的“和谈”阴谋的时候。在访印之前，柯西金和英国首相威尔逊在莫斯科会谈后叫嚷越南“冲突”必须“政治解决”。到了新德里，他又和印度反动政府的总理英迪拉·甘地以及正在访印的南斯拉夫叛徒集团头子铁托进行勾搭，鼓吹什么停止轰炸“将为实现政治解决而举行的谈判创造条件”。当美帝国主义在侵越战争的泥潭中越陷越深、无法自拔的时候，柯西金这样奔忙，显然是想重新打出苏英的所谓“日内瓦会议两主席”和印度的所谓印度支那“国际监督委员会主席”的招牌，来为美帝国主义挽救侵越败局效劳。柯西金在新德里干的这种勾当，再一次暴露了苏修集团对越南人民假支持、真出卖的叛徒嘴脸。
    但是，柯西金的这一切反革命活动都是枉然的。苏修领导集团无论怎样加紧进行援印反华的勾当，无论怎样起劲地为美帝国主义的侵越战争出谋划策，都无法挽救今天已经摇摇欲坠的印度国大党政府的反动统治，也无法挽救美帝国主义在越南的彻底失败。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义、苏修叛徒集团和它们的共同走卒印度反动派，正是按照这个逻辑走向灭亡。
