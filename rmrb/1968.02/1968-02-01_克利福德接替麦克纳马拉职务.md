	Clifford Succeeds McNamara

	According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 31st, Washington news: The U.S. Senate on the 30th approved the nomination by U.S. President Johnson of Clark Clifford as the Secretary of Defense, succeeding McNamara who was forced to step down due to being overwhelmed by the Vietnamese people in the Vietnam War.

	Clifford will take over McNamara's position in February. During the administrations of Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson, he actively served the U.S. imperialist aggression and war policies, holding high-level advisory positions on intelligence and defense issues. Since 1963, he has been the chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

	Upon taking office, Clifford immediately issued hysterical war cries and made arrogant anti-China statements. He shouted that he would continue on the basis of McNamara's already failed policy of invading Vietnam. This indicates that Clifford, like his predecessor, is a thoroughgoing war monger.

    克利福德接替麦克纳马拉职务
    据新华社三十一日讯  华盛顿消息：美国参议院三十日批准了美帝头子约翰逊提名的克拉克·克利福德为国防部长，接替在侵越战争中被越南人民打得焦头烂额而不得不滚下台去的麦克纳马拉。
    克利福德将于二月份接替麦克纳马拉的职务。他在杜鲁门、肯尼迪、约翰逊三届政府期间，积极为美帝的侵略和战争政策效劳，历任情报和防务问题方面的“高级顾问”，并且自一九六三年以来一直担任美国总统对外情报顾问委员会的主席。
    克利福德上台伊始就发出歇斯底里的战争叫嚣，并且猖狂反华。他叫嚷要在麦克纳马拉的已经破产的侵越政策的“基础上干下去”。这表明，克利福德同他的前任一样是不折不扣的战争贩子。
