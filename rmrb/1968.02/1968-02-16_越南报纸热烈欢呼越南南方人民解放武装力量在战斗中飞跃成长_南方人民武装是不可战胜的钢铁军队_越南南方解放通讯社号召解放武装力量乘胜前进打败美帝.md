Vietnamese newspapers warmly celebrate the rapid growth of the people's liberation armed forces in the South in combat. The armed forces of the people in the South are an invincible steel army. The South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency calls on the liberation armed forces to press forward and defeat the U.S. imperialists.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 15th, the Vietnamese "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" both published editorials on the 15th to warmly congratulate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the people's liberation armed forces in the South, celebrating the rapid growth and invincibility of the people's liberation armed forces in combat.

The editorial of the "People's Daily" pointed out that over the past seven years, the people's liberation armed forces have grown from small to large, from weak to strong, into a powerful revolutionary army comprising three types of armed forces. This army has achieved remarkable victories and has established a highly prestigious record. The power and brave fighting spirit of the people's liberation armed forces, combined with the struggle of our compatriots, have formed an overwhelmingly powerful force that crushes the enemy, opening up a very favorable new situation for our nation's anti-American struggle for national salvation.

The editorial said that in the earth-shattering struggle against American imperialism, the people's liberation armed forces have created and are creating rich experiences, making outstanding contributions to the revolutionary military treasury of the oppressed peoples who are rising up to fight for freedom and independence. The editorial concluded by saying that before our people achieve the final victory, the battle will still be arduous and fierce. We must press forward and advance.

The editorial of the "People's Army Daily" said that the great victories achieved by the heroic people of the South in the past period and the brilliant victories achieved this early spring are pushing the revolution to new heights, making the balance of power very favorable to us, and laying a solid foundation for us to ultimately achieve victory.

The editorial said that the people's liberation armed forces are a revolutionary army that comes from the people and fights for the people, always regarding the people as the source of strength, closely linked with the people. Where there are people, there is the foundation of the people's liberation armed forces; wherever the people's liberation armed forces go, the revolutionary movement flourishes. The flames of people's war have spread from the mountains to the plains, from the countryside to the cities, and are now an vast sea of fire, besieging and burning the enemy. The editorial calls on the people's liberation armed forces in the South to join forces with all the people, charge forward, launch continuous attacks, and relentlessly strike the U.S. and puppet forces, smash the puppet regime, and shatter the aggressive ambitions of the American bandits, achieving complete victory.

The New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 15th reported that the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency recently published an editorial on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the people's liberation armed forces in the South, calling on the people of the South to press forward and continue to strike the enemy with thunderous blows.

The editorial said that the people's liberation armed forces in the South, in the days of brilliant achievements during the Lunar New Year, joyfully commemorate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the people's liberation armed forces. The editorial said that our compatriots in the South, standing proudly at the forefront of the nation's struggle against American imperialism, are, under the leadership of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front, attacking the enemy with earth-shattering momentum, burning the U.S. and puppet clique with the flames of hatred.

After recounting the glorious combat history of the people's liberation armed forces in the South, the editorial said that this army, coming from the people and fighting for the people, is therefore unstoppable in its overwhelming power; it is a steel army that has established miraculous achievements that make the enemy tremble with fear.

The editorial said that after three years of confrontation with the U.S. aggressors, the people's liberation armed forces have proven with irrefutable facts that they are becoming stronger and more powerful in battle, seizing the initiative on the battlefield, and have the strength to completely defeat American imperialism. While the U.S. aggressors are becoming weaker and more defeated. The people's liberation armed forces have gloriously defeated the world's number one imperialist, fully deserving the title of "shock troops standing at the forefront of the people of our country and the people of the world in the struggle against U.S. aggressors."

The editorial said that the more the American bandits approach their doom, the more frantically they will struggle. The people's liberation armed forces in the South must press forward bravely and continue to strike the enemy with thunderous blows.

The editorial emphasized that we must resolutely and thoroughly implement the call of the command of the people's liberation armed forces in the South, with an overwhelming momentum to crush the enemy, decisively, boldly, persistently, and tenaciously charge forward, launch continuous attacks on the enemy, annihilate more of the enemy's fighting forces, and seize all the victories into our hands.
