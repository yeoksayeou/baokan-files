The Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe, at the end of last year, traversed thousands of mountains and rivers to reach the "Horn of Africa"—Somalia, and performed for more than a month. They performed in ten cities for 70,000 Somalian audiences, presenting twenty shows of revolutionary songs and dances that shone with the great thoughts of Mao Zedong. Each performance received enthusiastic applause and high praise. Some audience members praised, saying, "The Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe has brought us the revolutionary arts of the Mao Zedong era." Others said, "The Chinese art warriors have brought the anti-imperialist fighting friendship of 700 million Chinese people to the Somalian people."

Mao Zedong, Our Most Beloved Person

In the performances of the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe, the most popular among the broad Somalian audiences were the chorus "The East Is Red" and the dance "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," which praise the great leader Chairman Mao. Whenever the radiant image of Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, and whenever the announcer reported a program that praised Chairman Mao, mentioning his name, the audience below immediately erupted in sustained applause. Many audience members could not help but shout, "Long live Mao Zedong!" A Somalian journalist said passionately, "We wholeheartedly cheer for Chairman Mao's long life because we African people cannot do without Mao Zedong." A worker said, "I like to listen to 'The East Is Red' the most because this song sings the sincere feelings of the Chinese people and all the people of the world who love Chairman Mao." A driver excitedly said, "'The East Is Red' is the song we are most familiar with; Mao Zedong is the person we love the most."

In an agricultural farm where the Chinese Agricultural Technology Team is located, after the song and dance troupe finished their performance, several Somalian workers enthusiastically went up on stage. They wore Chairman Mao's badges on their chests, held the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and sang "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and "Long Live Chairman Mao" with great passion, expressing their love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

China Is the Most Firm Supporter of World Revolution

The anti-imperialist themed performances by the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe aroused strong anti-imperialist sentiments among the Somalian audiences. In the city of Hargeisa, 3,000 spectators watched the dance "Fighting South Vietnam." The atrocities of the American invaders' plundering and massacring the Vietnamese people aroused great indignation among the audience. Some audience members, unable to suppress their anger, raised their fists and shouted, "Down with Johnson!" "Yankee go home from South Vietnam!" When the stage showed the fighting people of South Vietnam reading Chairman Mao's quotations, the audience listened attentively and then excitedly shouted together with the performers, "Long live Chairman Mao!" A Somalian friend said, "This dance is a vivid lesson for us. All the people of the world should learn from the Vietnamese people." A writer said, "The performances by the Chinese artists have inspired the hearts of the Somalian people and the Vietnamese people to fight against the enemy. China is the most firm supporter of the world revolution."

Welcome, People Under the Leadership of Mao Zedong!

Following the teachings of Chairman Mao, the Chinese art warriors, who serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, were enthusiastically welcomed by the local people everywhere during their visit to Somalia. On the streets of the pastoral city of Burao, many Somalian friends cheered for the Chinese art workers, "China, Mao Zedong!" A young man held up photos of Chairman Mao and his closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, while shouting, "Long live Mao Zedong!" An old man tightly held the hand of a member of the song and dance troupe and said, "Welcome, people under the leadership of Mao Zedong!"

On January 7 of this year, when the war demon, U.S. Vice President Humphrey, "visited" Somalia, he was strongly opposed by the Somalian people, who drove him away with angry shouts. On the same day, the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe was performing in two groups in the southern and northern regions of Somalia, receiving extremely enthusiastic welcomes from the Somalian people. These two events formed a stark contrast.

That day, the Chinese art workers visiting the port of Kismayo in the south were invited to tour the sparkling sea harbor. When they passed by a small gunboat moored at the dock, a group of Somalian sailors enthusiastically waved at them. One of the sailors, pointing to a group of Americans nearby, gestured and shouted to the Chinese friends, "The American invaders are waging war in Vietnam, we will strangle the Yankees!"

On the day after Humphrey's "visit," the U.S. consul in northern Somalia arrived in Burao City with American films, attempting to use American films to counter the performances of the Chinese song and dance troupe. The U.S. consul proposed to show the film to the local residents on the same day as the Chinese art troupe's performance. However, this was rejected. After the shameful plot of this U.S. consul failed, he had to slink away that night with his tail between his legs.

The Hearts of the Peoples of China and Somalia Are Forever United

During their visit to Somalia, the internationalist spirit of the Chinese art workers serving the African people left a deep impression on the Somalian people. To ensure timely performances, they sometimes traveled hundreds of kilometers and did not have time to rest before starting to make up. Some performers fell ill, but to ensure that African brothers could see Chinese revolutionary songs and dances, they insisted on performing despite their illness. Abdulla, a Somalian friend who accompanied the art troupe on their visits and performances, said to the reporter more than once, "Everything the Chinese art troupe does will not surprise me because they are art warriors under the leadership of Chairman Mao."

When the Chinese art warriors bid farewell to the Somalian people, the Somalian artists condensed millions of words of farewell into one sentence: "Although we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are forever connected. For the sake of eliminating imperialism, our blood can flow together." At a grand farewell gathering before their departure, Chinese and Somalian art workers talked about the fighting friendship they had forged. An old Somalian poet wrote a poem to give to the Chinese art workers. The poem reads:

The Chinese people are always ready to aid the oppressed people,
This is thanks to the great and wise leader Mao Zedong.
We wholeheartedly admire the Chinese brothers,
The peoples of China and Somalia are forever united in heart.
Long live the great friendship between the peoples of China and Somalia!
Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

    中国文艺战士送来了毛泽东时代的革命文艺
    ——记索马里人民热烈欢迎中国东方红歌舞团的访问演出
    中国东方红歌舞团，去年年底越过千山万水，来到“非洲之角”——索马里，进行了一个多月的访问演出。他们在十个城市为七万索马里观众演出了二十场闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想光辉的革命歌舞。每场演出，都博得了热烈的掌声和高度评价。有的观众称赞说，中国东方红歌舞团给我们送来了毛泽东时代的革命文艺。有的说，中国文艺战士带来了七亿中国人民对索马里人民的反帝战斗友情。
    毛泽东，我们最热爱的人
    在中国歌舞团演出的节目中，最受索马里广大观众欢迎的是歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的合唱《东方红》和舞蹈《大海航行靠舵手》。每当光芒四射的毛主席像出现在天幕上的时候，每当报幕员报告一个颂扬毛主席的节目，提到毛主席的名字的时候，台下立即爆发出经久不息的掌声。许多观众情不自禁地高呼：“毛泽东，万岁！”一位索马里新闻工作者满怀激情地说：“我们衷心欢呼毛主席万岁，因为我们非洲人民离不开毛泽东。”一位工人说：“我最喜欢听《东方红》，因为这支歌唱出了中国人民和全世界人民热爱毛主席的真挚感情。”一位司机激动地说：“《东方红》，是我们最熟悉的歌；毛泽东，是我们最热爱的人。”
    在中国农业技术工作组所在的一个农场里，当歌舞团结束演出后，有几名索马里工人兴致勃勃地登上舞台。他们胸前佩戴毛主席像章，手捧红色宝书《毛主席语录》，满怀激情地演唱了《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和《万岁！毛主席》等歌曲，表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。
    中国是世界革命最坚定的支持者
    中国歌舞团演出的反帝题材的节目，激发了索马里观众强烈的反帝情绪。在哈尔格萨城，三千名观众观看了舞蹈《战斗的越南南方》。美国侵略者恣意掠夺和屠杀越南人民的暴行，激起了观众的极大愤怒。有的观众压抑不住心头怒火，举起拳头，高呼：“打倒约翰逊！”“美国佬，滚出南越！”而当舞台上战斗的越南南方人民朗读毛主席语录时，观众全神贯注地倾听，然后兴奋地和演员们一起高呼：“毛主席万岁！”一位索马里朋友说：“这个舞蹈是对我们的一次生动的教育。全世界人民都要学习越南人民。”一位作家说：“中国艺术家们的演出，激励了索马里人民和越南人民的同仇敌忾之心。中国是世界革命最坚定的支持者。”
    欢迎你们，毛泽东领导下的人民！
    遵循毛主席的教导，为工农兵服务的中国文艺战士，在索马里访问期间，到处受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。在牧区城市布劳的大街上，许多索马里朋友迎着中国艺术工作者欢呼：“中国，毛泽东！”一位青年一边举着毛主席和毛主席的最亲密战友林副主席的照片，一边高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”一位老人紧握着一位歌舞团人员的手说：“欢迎你们，毛泽东领导下的人民！”
    今年一月七日，战争瘟神、美国副总统汉弗莱到索马里“访问”时，遭到索马里人民的强烈反对，他们用愤怒的吼声，把这个战争瘟神轰走。同一天，中国东方红歌舞团正分成两队，在索马里南、北两区作访问演出，受到索马里人民极为热情的欢迎。这两件事形成了鲜明的对照。
    当天，正在南区的基斯马尤港访问的中国文艺工作者们应邀游览碧波粼粼的海港。在他们路经停泊在码头边上的一艘小炮艇时，一群索马里水手向他们热情地招手。其中一名水手，指着附近的一群美国佬，向中国朋友一面做手势一面大声地说：“美国侵略者在越南发动战争，我们要绞死美国佬！”
    在汉弗莱“访问”的次日，美国驻索马里北区的领事带上美国电影驱车来到布劳城，企图用美国电影来抵制中国歌舞团的演出。美国领事提出要在中国艺术团演出的同一天为当地居民放电影。但是遭到拒绝。这个美国领事的可耻阴谋破产之后，当晚只好夹着尾巴溜走了。
    索中两国人民永远心连心
    在索马里访问期间，中国文艺工作者为非洲人民服务的国际主义精神，给索马里人民留下了深刻的印象。他们为了保证及时演出，有时奔波了几百公里，还来不及休息，便动手化装。有的演员患了病，但为了使非洲兄弟能看到中国革命的歌舞艺术，坚持抱病参加演出。陪同艺术团到各地访问演出的索马里朋友阿卜杜拉欣不只一次对记者说：“中国艺术团的朋友们所做的一切，对我来说不会感到惊奇，因为他们是毛主席的文艺战士。”
    在中国文艺战士向索马里人民告别的时候，索马里的艺术家们把千万句惜别的话语汇成了一句话：“尽管相隔千山万水，我们的心却永远相连，为了消灭帝国主义，我们的血可以流在一起。”在离别前的一次隆重集会上，中索文艺工作者互相倾谈结下的战斗友谊。一位索马里老诗人作诗赠给中国文艺工作者们。诗中写道：
    中国人民随时准备援助被压迫的人民，
    这要归功于伟大的、英明的领袖毛泽东。
    我们衷心地钦佩中国兄弟，
    索中两国人民永远心连心。
    万岁，索中两国人民的伟大友谊！
    万岁，伟大的领袖毛主席！
