	Editor's Note: The entire contingent of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Artillery Corps, in the midst of the great proletarian cultural revolution, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply launched the revolutionary criticism movement, and fiercely opened fire on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev. Here, we have selected some articles by representatives of the Second Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works from the Artillery Corps who criticize China's Khrushchev. These articles are like cannonballs, fiercely striking the various fallacies of the "philosophy of life" spread by China's Khrushchev.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: A Communist Party member should "regard revolutionary interests as the first and foremost thing." By using Mao Zedong Thought to guide one's soul and establishing a proletarian worldview, one can have a heart for the motherland and eyes for the world, wholeheartedly for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the people, living to fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and dying to sacrifice for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thus being able to exert the greatest fighting power.

	Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought possess an unyielding spirit. The glorious heroic deeds they have created in the revolutionary struggle are the most powerful criticism of the "philosophy of life" propagated by the likes of China's Khrushchev.

	To Live for the Revolution and Fight, To Die for the Revolution and Sacrifice

	Political Commissar of a Certain Unit, Yú Chún

	China's Khrushchev shamelessly promotes the selfishness of the exploiting class and crazily spreads the bourgeois "philosophy of life," advocating that Communist Party members should "cherish themselves, protect their lives and health." His philosophy is that everything is for living, and living is everything. This is completely the philosophy of traitors and cowards.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that a Communist Party member should "regard revolutionary interests as the first and foremost thing" and be "ready at all times to sacrifice one's life for our cause." Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, countless revolutionary martyrs and predecessors have struggled hard, shed blood, and sacrificed their lives, seizing power from the enemy. Today, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and defend the ironclad socialist mountains and rivers, we must greatly carry forward that spirit of fearless and thorough revolution.

	A few years ago, I contracted colon cancer. After the operation, the doctor said that at most I could only live for three to five years. A question was placed before me: How should I face these three to five limited years of life? Should I follow China's Khrushchev's "philosophy of life," cherishing myself and protecting my life and health? Or should I follow Chairman Mao's teachings to "serve the people wholeheartedly, and die for the people's interests," fighting on the revolutionary path until the last moment of my life? At this critical moment, I resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, determined to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide every second of my life. As long as there is a breath of life, I must breathe with the people; as long as my body can move, I must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

	A Communist Party member should regard his personal life as belonging to the Party and not as private property; in the relationship between revolution and the body, revolution should come first, not life first. To cherish the body for the sake of living is a thorough bourgeois ideology. Even if one lives a few more years, it is of no value. The sole value of life does not lie in its length but in whether it is beneficial to the people. The more one does for the people, the greater one's contribution to the people, the greater the value of one's life. In the limited years of life, working hard is equivalent to prolonging life. The doctor's prediction that I could only live for three or five years is not a death sentence but a call to fight harder. This is the view of life and happiness of our proletarian soldiers.

	To live for the people and fight, to die for the people and sacrifice, is the true color of the proletarian revolution. Living is everything, everything for living, is the ugly soul of the bourgeoisie. Comrades like Liu Hulan, Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Cai Yongxiang, and Li Wenzhong, they sacrificed their young lives for the Party, for the people, and for the revolutionary cause. Though dead, they live on. Those who sell their souls, betray the revolution, and betray their comrades, crawling out from the enemy's open doghole, though they are alive, they have long been sentenced to death politically by the people, becoming a pile of filth despised by humanity.

	Let us raise the thousand-catty club of Mao Zedong Thought, smash China's Khrushchev's extreme selfish "philosophy of life," and throw it into the garbage dump!

### 生为革命战斗  死为革命献身

    编者按：中国人民解放军炮兵部队的全体指战员，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展革命大批判运动，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派猛烈开火。这里，我们选登了炮兵第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会部分代表批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一些文章。这些文章就象一颗颗炮弹，狠狠地轰击中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“活命哲学”的种种谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：一个共产党员，应该“以革命利益为第一生命”。用毛泽东思想统帅自己的灵魂，树立无产阶级的世界观，就能够胸怀祖国，放眼世界，一心为革命，一心为人民，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身，就能够发挥出最大的战斗力。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军战士，具有一往无前的精神，他们在革命斗争中所创造出的光辉的英雄事迹，是对中国赫鲁晓夫之流所宣扬的“活命哲学”的最有力的批判。
    生为革命战斗  死为革命献身
    某部政治委员　俞纯
    中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹剥削阶级的利己主义，疯狂散布资产阶级的“活命哲学”，他要共产党员“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”。他的哲学就是一切为了活着，活着就是一切。这完全是叛徒和怕死鬼的哲学。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，一个共产党员，应该“以革命利益为第一生命”，要“随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业”。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，无数革命先烈和革命前辈艰苦奋斗，流血牺牲，从敌人手里夺得了政权。今天为了巩固无产阶级专政，保卫社会主义铁打的江山，同样需要大大发扬那种奋不顾身的彻底革命精神。
    前几年，我得了结肠癌症，开刀之后，据医生说，最长只能活三年到五年。一个问题摆在我面前：怎样对待这三年到五年的有限生命？是按照中国赫鲁晓夫的“活命哲学”，好好地“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”呢？还是遵照毛主席的教导为人民利益“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”，在革命的征途上战斗到生命的最后一刻呢？在这关键的时刻，我坚决按照毛主席的教导，下定决心用毛泽东思想统帅自己生命的每一秒钟，只要还有一口气，就要和人民同呼吸，只要身体还能动弹，就要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，朝着毛主席指引的方向前进！
    一个共产党员，应该把个人的生命看成是党所有的，而决不能当成私有的；在革命和身体的关系上，应该是革命第一，而不能活命第一。为了活命而爱护身体，是地地道道的资产阶级思想，即使多活几年，也是毫无价值的。生命的唯一价值不在于它的长短，而在于它是否对人民有益。一个人给人民做的事情越多，对人民的贡献越大，生命的价值就越大。在有限的生命里，加倍努力地工作，就等于延长了生命。医生预言只能活三年、五年，实际上我现在还活的很好。医生的话不是死的号令，而是加紧战斗的号令。这就是我们无产阶级战士的生死观、幸福观。
    生为人民战斗，死为人民献身，是无产阶级的革命本色。活着就是一切，一切为了活着，是资产阶级的丑恶灵魂。象刘胡兰、董存瑞、黄继光、蔡永祥、李文忠等同志，他们为了党，为了人民，为了革命的利益献出了自己年轻的生命，虽死犹生。那些出卖灵魂，出卖革命，出卖同志，从敌人敞开的狗洞里爬出来的叛徒，他们虽然活着，但是在政治上早已被人民判了死刑，变成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
    让我们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫极端利己主义的“活命哲学”，把它扔进垃圾堆里！
