Ecuadorians Hold Anti-American Protests
Ecuadorian workers and students have recently been holding anti-American protests and rallies in several major cities, demanding the abolition of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol.

In Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, protesting students, despite police suppression, angrily threw stones at the American consulate and the Ecuadorian-American Center, repeatedly chanting slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!" and "Abolish the Rio de Janeiro Protocol!" The protesters also attacked the offices of the British-Ecuadorian Oil Company, a monopoly run by American and British capital, and burned an American consulate car.

In Quito, the capital of Ecuador, the masses also held anti-American protests. Workers and students attacked the residence of the American diplomatic mission, and the authorities sent police to "guard" it.

In cities such as Cuenca, Loja, Machala, Ambato, Portoviejo, and Esmeraldas, Ecuadorian patriots also held demonstrations against American imperialism and the Rio de Janeiro Protocol.

African American Students Engage in Violent Struggle
Following the unprecedented fierce struggle in 1967, African Americans in the United States have once again begun a violent struggle against oppression in the new year. Starting from the 5th, black students in Wallaceburg, South Carolina, fought bravely against reactionary military police for four consecutive nights.

On the night of the 8th, the reactionary military police savagely opened fire on the protesting students, who bravely fired back.

Australian Youth Hold Anti-Draft Protests
Fifty Australian youths on the 7th held a protest in front of a draft office in Melbourne, opposing the Australian government's conscription of young people to serve as cannon fodder for American invaders in South Vietnam.

Among the protesters, four youths, despite police interference, linked arms and blocked the draft office's entrance for twenty-five minutes.

The protesters stated that they would continue to persist in the anti-draft struggle.

Yemen Establishes News Agency
At a time when American imperialism, with the support of Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni royalist forces, launched a military invasion of Yemen in an attempt to overthrow the Yemeni Republican government, the Yemen News Agency was established in Yemen.

Yemeni Minister of Information Muhammad Abdul Numan told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "At a time when the Yemeni people are fighting against the evil plots of American imperialism and the Saudi Arabian reactionaries, it is necessary to establish the Yemen News Agency." He said, "The main task of the Yemen News Agency is to report on the Yemeni people's struggle against imperialism and reactionaries, and to mobilize the masses to defeat all kinds of invaders supported by American imperialism."

Jordanian Forces Counter Israeli Military Provocations
On the 15th, Israeli forces launched large-scale military provocations along various segments of the ceasefire line between Israel and Jordan.

Starting from 3 PM local time, Israeli forces used artillery and tank guns to shell Jordanian frontline positions on the east bank of the Jordan River. Israeli artillery also fired incendiary shells at some Jordanian villages. At the same time, the Israeli Air Force used napalm bombs to attack some Jordanian positions and villages. Jordanian forces retaliated. Six Israeli aircraft were hit by Jordanian anti-aircraft fire, and Jordanian artillery hit some Israeli positions.
