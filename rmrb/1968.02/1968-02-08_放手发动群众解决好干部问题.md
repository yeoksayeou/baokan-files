Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units. This issue must be resolved." Chairman Mao also pointed out: "The cadre issue should be addressed through education, expanding the scope of education." In the new situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is increasingly important to seriously resolve the cadre issue in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The revolutionary masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery Industry, based on the successful operation of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, have mobilized the masses to do thorough and detailed ideological and political work among cadres, helping erring cadres to stand up and join the revolution, guided by Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Their approach is worthy of promotion.

Uniting and educating cadres, helping erring cadres to stand up and join the revolution, is a glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao. Doing this is not just about one person; it is about our attitude towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions, our attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, and our attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by resolving this attitude issue can we hope to resolve the cadre issue.

Once the masses are mobilized, everything becomes manageable. This is a truth.

Cadres work among the masses. Whether a cadre is good or bad, whether they have made mistakes but can be educated and saved, the masses have a clear understanding and comparison. After more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, the class consciousness and policy level of the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses have significantly improved. They will definitely, based on Chairman Mao's cadre policy, comprehensively and historically evaluate cadres, boldly use good and relatively good cadres, and select them for important positions. They will also seriously, actively, and enthusiastically help erring cadres, enabling them to be liberated politically and ideologically.

Correctly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy is a revolution that touches the soul for both cadres and the masses. Erroneous cadres, through the serious criticism and enthusiastic help of the broad revolutionary masses, can deeply recognize their mistakes and resolutely correct them; at the same time, the broad revolutionary masses can also learn from the mistakes of cadres and gain insights.

Most of our cadres are good and relatively good. All cadres who have made mistakes should follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, seriously reflect on their mistakes, actively go among the masses, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, win the understanding of the masses with their actual actions, and thoroughly transform their worldview in the great furnace of class struggle.

    放手发动群众解决好干部问题
    本报评论员
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”毛主席还指出：“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新形势下，按照毛主席的最新指示，认真地解决好干部问题，显得越来越重要了。
    第六机械工业部的无产阶级革命派，在办好毛泽东思想学习班的基础上，放手发动群众，以毛主席最新指示为纲，对干部做深入细致的思想政治工作，帮助犯错误的干部站出来革命。他们的做法是值得提倡的。
    团结、教育干部，帮助犯错误的干部站出来革命，是毛主席交给我们无产阶级革命派的光荣任务。这样做，不是对那一个人的问题，而是对毛主席最新指示的态度问题，对毛泽东思想的态度问题，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度问题。解决了这个态度问题，才有可能把干部问题解决好。
    群众发动起来了，一切问题都好办了。这是一条真理。
    干部是在群众中工作的。干部那个好，那个坏，那个犯了错误但是可以教育挽救的，在群众心目中是有个数，有个比较的。经过一年多来的文化大革命，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的阶级觉悟和政策水平有了很大的提高。他们一定会根据毛主席的干部政策，全面地历史地看待干部，大胆地使用好的和比较好的干部，把他们推选到重要岗位上；并且一定会严肃、积极、热情地帮助犯错误的干部，使他们从政治思想上得到解放。
    正确地贯彻毛主席的干部政策，对干部和群众来说，都是一场触及灵魂的革命。犯错误的干部，经过广大革命群众严肃的批评、热情的帮助，才能深刻地认识错误、坚决地改正错误；同时，广大革命群众也能够从干部的错误中吸取教训，得到借鉴。
    我们的干部，大多数是好的和比较好的。一切犯有错误的干部，都应当遵照毛主席的伟大教导，斗私批修，认真地检讨自己的错误，主动地到群众里面去，虚心听取群众的意见，以自己的实际行动取得群众的谅解，在阶级斗争的大熔炉中彻底改造自己的世界观。
