People of Thanh Hoa-Hue Region Launch Mobile Attacks, Fighting Bravely

In the past four days, the people of Hue City and its suburbs have fought bravely and flexibly against the enemy, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy's forces. From February 21 to 24, the people of Hue annihilated nearly a thousand enemy troops, destroyed or damaged fifteen military vehicles, sank six enemy ships, and shot down two enemy aircraft.

The report said that on the morning of February 24, the people of Hue fiercely intercepted three enemy battalions that were desperately counterattacking towards the northern part of Hue City under the cover of numerous aircraft and artillery. The brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces charged into the enemy ranks, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. They used grenades, submachine guns, and bayonets to kill or wound more than two hundred enemy troops, completely annihilating one enemy company. The remaining enemy troops fled in disarray, and the People's Liberation Armed Forces and Hue City's self-defense forces pursued them with fierce firepower, killing many more enemy troops.

At the same time, in the southern part of Hue City, the People's Liberation Armed Forces and self-defense forces worked closely together, successfully repelling five enemy reinforcements from the Americans. They annihilated nearly one hundred and fifty American invaders. Thus, on February 24 alone, the people of Hue annihilated more than three hundred and fifty enemy troops and destroyed or damaged eight armored vehicles and other military vehicles. Before this, from February 21 to 23, the people of Hue City and its suburbs worked closely together, launching mobile attacks and bravely repelling the enemy's numerous desperate counterattacks. They annihilated and captured more than six hundred enemy troops (the vast majority of whom were American invaders), damaged seven armored vehicles, sank six warships and speedboats, shot down two enemy aircraft, and seized a large amount of weapons.
