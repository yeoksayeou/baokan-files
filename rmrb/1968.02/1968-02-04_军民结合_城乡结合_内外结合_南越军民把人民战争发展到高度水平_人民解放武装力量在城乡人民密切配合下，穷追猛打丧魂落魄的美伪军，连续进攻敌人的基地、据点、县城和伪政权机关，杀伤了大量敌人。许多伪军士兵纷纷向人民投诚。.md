The people's liberation armed forces, in close cooperation with the urban and rural populations, relentlessly pursued and fiercely attacked the demoralized American and puppet forces. They continuously launched assaults on enemy bases, strongholds, county towns, and puppet government agencies, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Many puppet soldiers surrendered to the people.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, February 3rd: During the Spring Festival, the people's liberation armed forces of South Vietnam swept through the American and puppet forces with an overwhelming force and are now advancing in victory, continuing to relentlessly pursue and fiercely attack the demoralized enemy, seizing new victories.

According to reports, on the 2nd and 3rd, the people's liberation armed forces, with the support and cooperation of the people of Saigon, continued to eliminate the American and puppet forces in the city and suburbs of Saigon. In the early hours of the 2nd, the people's liberation armed forces attacked 19 puppet police stations in Saigon, eliminating many enemies. At the same time, they also attacked the enemy's ammunition depot, destroying an important enemy warehouse. In the early hours of the 3rd, the people's liberation armed forces continued to attack the enemy's New Mountain Base, bombarded a power station in the suburbs, and continued to control a section of the road from Saigon to the Bien Hoa Base. The guerrilla teams of the people's liberation armed forces were very active in the streets of the city, fighting so fiercely that the American and puppet forces dared not stop on the streets. Western news agencies reported that every step American officials took in Saigon required a large escort of military police. Currently, Saigon is still in chaos, with American wounded soldiers filling the hospitals, and American camps having only enough food for three to four days. The Associated Press of the United States lamented, "Saigon is practically a besieged city," and "the activities of this city have come to a standstill."

In the outskirts of Saigon, the people's liberation armed forces continued to sweep through the enemy with a fierce offensive. On the 2nd, the people's liberation armed forces captured the provincial capitals of Long An Province, located about 70 kilometers north of Saigon, and Phuoc Tuy Province, as well as attacking the important coastal base of Vung Tau near Saigon. Previously, the military and civilians of Tuyen Duc Province also launched continuous attacks on the American and puppet forces' many bases, strongholds, county towns, and puppet government agencies in the early hours of the 31st. According to preliminary reports, in the Lai Thieu area, the shells of the liberation army hit the enemy's airfield, parking lot, artillery positions, and American command post, causing the ammunition depot to explode and the fuel depot to burn, eliminating many American invaders. In the county town of Bien Hoa, after a 40-minute battle, the local military and civilians took control of the county town, destroyed the base of the puppet army's 5th Division, 8th Regiment, and many puppet soldiers surrendered to the people. On the morning of the 31st, the people's liberation armed forces and people of Binh Dinh Province launched a fierce attack on the enemy's Phu My administrative district in Binh Dinh City and destroyed many of the enemy's agencies.

In the important city of Hue in the northern part of South Vietnam, the people's liberation armed forces, together with local patriotic students and people, repelled the American and puppet forces' repeated counterattacks and still controlled most of the city of Hue. The glorious flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam still flew over this ancient city. Western news agencies admitted that under the fierce firepower of the people's liberation armed forces, the American Marine Corps suffered heavy casualties, and the puppet army's losses were even greater.

In other important cities in the northern part of South Vietnam, such as Da Nang, Kontum, Pleiku, and Dalat, the people's liberation armed forces continued to relentlessly pursue and attack the enemy. In Pleiku, the people's liberation armed forces not only killed a large number of American and puppet forces in the city but also bombarded the American airbase. In Dalat, the people's liberation armed forces continued to fiercely attack the American military facilities, special forces camps, and puppet government institutions in the city. On the 3rd, the people's liberation armed forces again bombarded the American base in Da Nang. Previously, the local military and civilians also attacked the enemy strongholds on the strategic road from Da Nang to the Phu Bai Airport, cutting off the road.

In other provinces in the central region and the Mekong Delta, victories were also reported frequently. In Quang Nam Province, various revolutionary armed forces in Tam Ky City, in close cooperation with people from all walks of life, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's military quarters, puppet police stations, and broadcasting stations at 3 AM on the 30th. The people of Quang Nam Province also rose up with the revolutionary armed forces in various places to destroy the enemy's oil pipeline, blow up bridges, smash the enemy's shackles, and took control of the county towns of Tam Ky, Tam Phuoc, Thang Binh, and An Ninh.

That evening, the military and civilians of Quang Ngai Province also attacked the Dong Ha Airfield, destroying many enemy aircraft.

In Quang Tri Province, various revolutionary armed forces, with the cooperation of the local people, fought bravely for two consecutive days and nights, capturing many enemy agencies in the city of Quang Tri, including the enemy's military quarters command, the 5th Special Forces Command, Quang Tri Airport, the residence of the puppet "governor," the broadcasting station, the railway station, the enemy's logistics base, and many administrative agencies of the puppet government in the city center. At dawn on the 31st, they again launched a fierce attack on the Dong Ha American Airfield and destroyed all enemy aircraft.

In the province of Dac Lac, the local military and civilians are still in control of the city of Buon Ma Thuot.

In the Mekong Delta, the military and civilians of Kien Giang Province captured the enemy military quarters command, artillery positions, Kien Giang City broadcasting station, prison, the base of the puppet 10th Regiment, and many puppet government agencies at dawn on the 31st. They severely damaged the command of the puppet 10th Regiment, the command of the riverine warfare fleet, and the command of the armored vehicle fleet, eliminating many remnants. The puppet soldiers stationed in five outposts in the suburbs surrendered to the people with their weapons under the powerful offensive of the people's liberation armed forces. On the afternoon of the 1st, tens of thousands of people from the liberated areas rushed into Kien Giang City, joining the people in the city in the struggle. They beat drums, shouted slogans, chased after reactionary leaders and American lackeys who had done many evil deeds, surrounded the enemy's strongholds and outposts, and completely controlled Kien Giang City and its suburbs.

The people's liberation armed forces of Vinh Long Province continued to fiercely attack the American base in the suburbs of Vinh Long City on the 2nd, forcing the American invaders to flee from the base in panic.

The military and civilians of Dinh Tuong Province launched a multi-pronged attack on Dinh Tuong City at dawn on the 31st. According to preliminary reports, after about an hour and a half of fighting, the military and civilians of Dinh Tuong Province occupied the residence of the puppet "governor," the residence of the American "adviser," the provincial security command, the puppet police headquarters, and many important streets. The people of Dinh Tuong City also rose up to eliminate evil gangsters and traitors.

The people's liberation armed forces and people of Can Tho Province fought bravely with the enemy on the 1st, capturing many streets and important targets in the city of Can Tho, annihilating the provincial security command, tightly surrounding the command of the puppet 32nd Regiment, and severely damaging the 3rd Battalion of the puppet 21st Division. With the assistance of the people's liberation armed forces, the citizens of Can Tho City took to the streets in large numbers, holding demonstrations and setting up barriers on various streets to chase after stubborn gangsters. The broad masses of rural people rushed into various towns and cities to hold demonstrations, assist the people's liberation armed forces in the fight, and, together with the guerrilla forces, surrounded the enemy's various strongholds and outposts. Currently, the military and civilians of Can Tho Province are continuing to attack other enemy targets within the province, surrounding the enemy's strongholds and outposts.
