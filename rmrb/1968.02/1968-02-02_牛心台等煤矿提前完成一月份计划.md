The revolutionary workers of Niu Xintai Coal Mine and Da Shifu Coal Mine under the Benxi Mining Bureau have earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." In the brilliant year of 1968, they fired the first shot in production. Both mines have completed their January raw coal production plans ahead of schedule. Da Shifu Mine's production level in January this year increased by 10% compared to December last year. Under the unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers in both mines has surged even higher. They voluntarily uphold the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committees. In production, everyone listens to commands and voluntarily observes labor discipline. The upper and lower levels are united as one, and the production departments and auxiliary departments closely cooperate with each other, working together. Many new situations have emerged. The members of the Niu Xintai Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee have gone deep into the production front lines, propagating Mao Zedong Thought on one hand and participating in production labor on the other. In the course of labor, they help solve transportation difficulties, accelerate vehicle turnover, and meet production needs.

    牛心台等煤矿提前完成一月份计划
    本溪矿务局牛心台煤矿和田师傅煤矿的革命职工，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在光辉灿烂的一九六八年打响了生产第一炮，两矿都提前完成一月份原煤生产计划。田师傅矿今年一月的生产水平比去年十二月提高了百分之十。在空前大好的革命形势推动下，两矿革命职工生产积极性更加高涨。他们自觉维护革命委员会的革命权威。在生产中大家听从指挥，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，上下团结一致，生产部门和辅助部门之间密切配合，相互协作，出现了很多新气象。牛心台煤矿革委会的成员深入到生产第一线，一面宣传毛泽东思想，一面参加生产劳动，在劳动中帮助解决运输困难，加速车辆周转，满足了生产需要。          （据新华社）
