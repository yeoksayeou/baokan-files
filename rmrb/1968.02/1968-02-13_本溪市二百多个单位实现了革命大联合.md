In the coal and iron city of Benxi, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They resolutely strike down bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and have swiftly launched a high tide of revolutionary great alliance across all sectors of the city. Since the radiant and brilliant year of 1968 began, over 200 factories, mines, organs, schools, streets, and people's communes in the city have achieved revolutionary great alliance. Moreover, nearly 50 units have established revolutionary committees.
