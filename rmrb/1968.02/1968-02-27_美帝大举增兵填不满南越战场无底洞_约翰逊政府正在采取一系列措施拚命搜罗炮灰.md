In the face of frequent victories by the military and people of South Vietnam and the increasingly heavy casualties suffered by U.S. aggressor forces, the Johnson administration is taking a series of measures to frantically recruit cannon fodder, in a desperate attempt to fill the bottomless pit of the South Vietnamese battlefield and make more frantic, dying struggles.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 24th, Washington: In the face of the situation where the military and people of South Vietnam are frequently reporting victories and U.S. aggressor forces are suffering increasingly heavy casualties, the Johnson administration is taking a series of measures domestically to urgently recruit cannon fodder, in a vain attempt to fill the bottomless pit of the South Vietnamese battlefield and make more frantic, dying struggles.

According to an announcement by the U.S. Department of Defense on the 23rd, the U.S. government will conscript 48,000 people in April. This number is the highest monthly conscription figure since the U.S. began massively increasing troops in South Vietnam in October 1966. The U.S. Department of Defense also announced that it would increase the conscription figure for March from the originally planned 39,000 to 41,000.

Prior to this, the Johnson administration had already announced the cancellation of previous exemptions for university graduates, graduate students, and certain professionals to expand the pool of conscripts. It is reported that the U.S. Selective Service System is also planning to conscript medical personnel.

Recently, the military and people of South Vietnam have launched continuous, all-out offensives, severely defeating the U.S. aggressors, plunging the more than 500,000 U.S. aggressor troops in South Vietnam into the sea of people's war, suffering heavy casualties and being in a miserable state. Facing this situation, the Johnson administration has been forced to withdraw more than 10,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and other units that were left in the country as a mobile force to urgently reinforce the South Vietnamese battlefield. U.S. military authorities admit that due to the continuous withdrawal of "trained troops" from the country, the U.S. government's ability to send troops to other parts of the world to suppress people's revolutionary struggles has been depleted to a "dangerous point."

It is reported that the U.S. Department of Defense is also studying ten "mobilization plans" proposed by the military due to the "extremely serious situation" in South Vietnam. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have also suggested mobilizing 50,000 reservists and National Guardsmen and putting another 100,000 on special alert. Prior to this, the U.S. government had already mobilized 14,000 air force and navy reservists under the pretext of the "Pueblo" spy ship incident.

Meanwhile, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler arrived in Saigon on the 23rd to discuss "future military needs" and the possible conscription of reservists with the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland. According to Democratic Representative Leggett, he believes that the military will demand the dispatch of an additional 100,000 troops to South Vietnam beyond the already set limit of 525,000.

Under the incitement of the Johnson administration, U.S. military and political leaders are issuing a chorus of war cries. They shout about launching a "comprehensive offensive" on land, sea, and air in Vietnam, implementing "partial mobilization," strengthening the bombing of Vietnam, and large-scale production of aircraft and other military equipment, etc.

However, in the face of the Vietnamese people's continuous victories, the Johnson administration's war measures will not only fail to change the already determined defeat of U.S. imperialism in the Vietnam War, but will also make it sink deeper into the Vietnam War and ultimately suffer a more miserable defeat.

    美帝大举增兵填不满南越战场无底洞
    约翰逊政府正在采取一系列措施拚命搜罗炮灰
    据新华社二十四日讯　华盛顿消息：在越南南方军民捷报频传，美国侵略军伤亡越来越惨重的形势下，约翰逊政府正在国内采取一连串措施，加紧搜罗炮灰，妄图填补南越战场的无底洞，作更疯狂的垂死挣扎。
    据美国国防部二十三日宣布，美国政府四月份将征兵四万八千人，这个数字是一九六六年十月美国在南越大举增兵以来，美国每个月征兵的最高数字。美国国防部还宣布把三月份的征兵数字从原定的三万九千人提高到四万一千人。
    在这之前，约翰逊政府已宣布将取消过去对大学毕业生、研究生和某些专业人员的免征规定，以扩大兵源。据报道，美国征兵局还在策划征召医务人员。
    最近，越南南方军民连续全面出击，狠揍美国侵略者，使南越战场上的五十多万美国侵略军深陷在人民战争的火海里，伤亡惨重，狼狈不堪。面对着这种局势，约翰逊政府被迫从留在国内作为机动兵力的第八十二空降师等单位，抽调了万余人开赴南越战场紧急增援。美国军事当局承认，由于从国内不断抽调“受过训练的部队”，美国政府能够派赴世界其他地区镇压人民革命斗争的陆军和海军陆战队已经消耗到“危险点”。
    据报道，美国国防部还正在研究军方根据南越“极端严重的局势”而提出的多达十项的“动员计划”。参谋长联席会议也建议动员后备役和国民警卫队五万人，并且使另外十万人处于特别警戒状态。在这之前，美国政府已经借口“普韦布洛号”间谍船事件，动员了空军和海军后备役人员一万四千余人。
    与此同时，美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒二十三日抵达西贡，同侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰讨论“未来的军队需要”和因此而引起的可能征召后备役人员的问题。据民主党众议员莱格特说，他认为军方将要求在已定的五十二万五千人的限额之外，再向南越增派十万人。
    在约翰逊政府的煽动下，美国军政头目们发出一片战争叫嚣。他们叫嚷什么要在越南发动陆、海、空的“全面攻势”，要实行“局部动员”、要加强对越南的狂轰滥炸，以及要大规模生产飞机和其他军事装备，等等。
    但是，在越南人民的节节胜利面前，约翰逊政府的好战措施，不仅无法改变美帝国主义在侵越战争中已定的败局，而且必将使它在侵越战争中陷得更深，最后失败得更惨。
