Ma Tongrong is the deputy director of the political department of the Sixth Machinery Ministry. He was previously arrogant and detached from the masses, making numerous mistakes in recent years. During the Cultural Revolution, he carried out the bourgeois reactionary line and was criticized and struggled against by the masses. Since the winter of the previous year, he has been sidelined and has not gained the trust and understanding of the masses.

Our group was entrusted by the revolutionary masses of the Sixth Machinery Ministry to specifically assist Comrade Ma Tongrong. Throughout the assistance process, our group always used the great thoughts of Mao Zedong as a weapon, carrying our own and the assisted person's problems, and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with Comrade Ma Tongrong. Over a total of forty-seven days, through holding small and medium-sized meetings and home visits, we finally helped Comrade Ma Tongrong raise his consciousness, spark a revolution in his soul, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses passed his self-criticism and announced his liberation. This is a victory for the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong and a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Deciding to Help Cadres

After our group was established, the first problem we encountered was how to approach assisting Comrade Ma Tongrong.

Initially, some comrades felt that Ma Tongrong's mistakes were quite serious and his attitude was poor, making them impatient. They said that Ma Tongrong had a way of dealing with the masses that was hard to handle. They advocated holding one or two small meetings with him, and if that didn't work, holding a large meeting to criticize him. Some comrades disagreed, believing this was not the way to handle comrades or resolve contradictions among the people.

With these issues in mind, we studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao said: "For cadres who have made serious mistakes, as long as they do not persist in their mistakes and sincerely correct them, and are forgiven by the broad revolutionary masses, they can still stand up and join the revolutionary ranks." He also repeatedly taught us to "punish past mistakes and prevent future ones, cure the sickness and save the patient," "one look, two helps," and "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity." Chairman Mao's teachings opened our eyes. Looking at Comrade Ma Tongrong, he came from a poor peasant family, had a clear history, and had done many things beneficial to the people in the past thirty years of party membership. Although he carried out the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution and made some serious mistakes in the past, he could not be said to be incorrigible or persistently unrepentant, nor did he belong to the category of anti-party and anti-socialism. If we helped him correct his mistakes, not only would we save a comrade, but we would also add strength to the party.

After repeated study and discussion, we all agreed that uniting and educating cadres is a glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao. Whether or not to help Comrade Ma Tongrong is not just a matter of his personal problem, but a matter of our attitude towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions, our attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, and a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line. We unanimously decided to definitely help Comrade Ma Tongrong correct his mistakes according to the correct way of handling contradictions among the people. At the same time, we took the resolve that if we did not help Comrade Ma Tongrong well, we would not rest. We overcame the feelings of difficulty and trouble, and began the in-depth, detailed, and patient work of assisting Comrade Ma Tongrong.

Treating the Symptoms, Carrying Out Three Helps

After correcting our own attitudes, the next issue was how to specifically assist Comrade Ma Tongrong. Chairman Mao said: "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." Therefore, our first step was to conduct investigations and research, collecting all available materials and carefully analyzing them. Finally, we found the root cause of his problems in his history, his performance at key moments in the struggle between the two lines, his mistakes during the Cultural Revolution, and his current active thoughts. His core problem was his bourgeois worldview, which had not been transformed, centered around the "self." Then, based on his characteristics, we treated his symptoms with specific help from the following three aspects.

First, we helped him correct his attitude and change his stance. Chairman Mao said: "In the world, to accomplish something, an honest attitude is essential." One of Ma Tongrong's main problems was his lack of a sincere and honest attitude. In the past, whenever he made mistakes, he did not take them seriously and was transferred to a new job. This time, after making mistakes, he did not take a serious attitude towards his mistakes. In his first two self-criticisms, he only put on a show without discussing facts or revealing his thoughts. When the masses criticized him, he was not convinced, saying that he had not been clearly informed beforehand. He was particularly afraid of sharp criticism, had the idea of "struggle, criticize, and leave," and wanted to leave the Sixth Machinery Ministry after the Cultural Revolution ended. He lacked the determination for self-revolution and was afraid of the masses' supervision. Therefore, when we helped him, we first helped him change his stance and correct his attitude, helping him to correctly treat himself and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and to start self-revolution.

For example, we addressed his fear of the masses' criticism by studying Chairman Mao's teaching: "Because we serve the people, we should not be afraid of others pointing out our mistakes." We also addressed his idea of "struggle, criticize, and leave" by studying Chairman Mao's instructions: "Making mistakes is inevitable, but as long as you sincerely correct them, it's fine." We also pointed out the dangers of not correcting mistakes.

In addition, we studied with him Chairman Mao's teachings on cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution, the requirements for Communist Party members, and the "Three Articles" (Serve the People, In Memory of Norman Bethune, and The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains), and compared these conditions, requirements, and the bright images of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Foolish Old Man with him, helping him to check himself. This assistance deeply moved Ma Tongrong. He said: "For a long time, I have been burdened by the old cadres' baggage, overestimating myself. I thought my worldview had no problems and did not pay attention to self-transformation. This is my biggest problem." He expressed: "I must listen to Chairman Mao's words, change the 'fear' character to 'dare,' change the 'self' character to 'public,' and change 'believing in myself' to 'believing in the masses.' I must not be like Ah Q, fearing criticism and protecting my own sores." He also hoped that we would not have any reservations and that no matter how we criticized him, he would not be resentful.

Second, we helped him raise his consciousness and grasp the root cause. Chairman Mao taught us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Ma Tongrong made mistakes mainly because his bourgeois worldview, centered around the "self," had not been transformed. Although he came from a poor family and performed well during the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and land reform, after moving to the city, he could not resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, beginning to pursue enjoyment and special treatment in life, and then compromising on major principle issues, not daring to uphold principles. Finally, he lost his stance in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and carried out the bourgeois reactionary line. However, Ma Tongrong did not recognize or realize these problems for a long time. Although he made some self-criticisms, he could not grasp the key points and raise them to the level of principles.

In the process of assisting him, in addition to helping him to deeply reflect and fight against the "self," based on the experience of the army, we specially conducted class education for Ma Tongrong in the form of "one display, two comparisons, three studies, and four examinations." One display of his facts of alienation from the masses and making mistakes; two comparisons of his current life with the lives of workers and peasants and his life as a poor child in the old society; three studies of Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, especially Chairman Mao's repeated warnings about preventing the bourgeoisie from attacking with sugar-coated bullets; four examinations of Ma Tongrong's thought process and the causes of his mistakes. We also studied and discussed with him Chairman Mao's theories on contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, as well as important documents of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, helping him to raise his mistakes to the height of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines for recognition, criticism, and self-criticism. Through such repeated study and assistance, Ma Tongrong's consciousness was finally raised, and his soul was deeply touched. In his self-criticism, he said with great pain: "For a long time, I regarded pursuing enjoyment and special treatment in life as trivial matters and did not regard them as a breakthrough for peaceful evolution. When the masses criticized me, I did not understand or realize. In fact, political degeneration often starts from life. Now that everyone criticizes me for not being from a poor family, it hits the nail on the head, showing that I have degenerated towards the bourgeoisie, to the point of making mistakes in the Cultural Revolution." Finally, he expressed that he would definitely learn from the lessons, study Chairman Mao's works seriously, transform his worldview, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and loyal to the great thoughts of Mao Zedong. He would follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment for life, and make amends in the Cultural Revolution and future work.

Third, we helped him put down his arrogance and get close to the masses. Chairman Mao said: "We must solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates well and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses." Ma Tongrong was previously high above the masses and seriously alienated from them. After the Cultural Revolution began, he was sidelined for a long time, reflecting on his mistakes, and his relationship with the masses became even more distant. To help him solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates and the relationship between cadres and the masses, while helping him study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and raising his consciousness, we also followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around and see, insist on the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything, becoming the students of the masses." We urged him to go to the masses, listen to opinions, and accept criticism. Initially, Ma Tongrong had many concerns, fearing that the masses would not forgive him after he went down. After our repeated encouragement and assistance, he finally went to the Security Department, where there were many opinions about him, with a tentative attitude. Unexpectedly, when he arrived, the comrades not only seriously criticized him but also sincerely helped him, and enthusiastically encouraged him to correctly treat himself with a one-division-two view and not to carry a burden. The broad revolutionary masses' spirit of seeking truth from facts and understanding made Ma Tongrong deeply moved. He said: "Only now do I truly feel the warmth of class love and understand the great significance of the truth that 'the masses are the real heroes.'"

Now, the relationship between Ma Tongrong and the masses has changed significantly. He not only puts down his arrogance and studies with the masses of his department, struggles against selfishness and criticizes revisionism, but also appears as an ordinary laborer, getting up early and arriving early every day, sweeping the floor and fetching water with everyone, and finding time to talk with comrades. The more opinions there are about him, the more he goes. Comrades' views of him have also changed. They not only help and understand him but also trust and support him to stand up and work. A new relationship between cadres and the masses has begun to take shape in the political department of the Sixth Machinery Ministry.

Learning While Helping, Punishing Past Mistakes and Preventing Future Ones

The above is the process of helping Comrade Ma Tongrong recognize and correct his mistakes, and it is also the process of us and Comrade Ma Tongrong studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together. During this period, while helping Comrade Ma Tongrong recognize and correct his mistakes, we also learned a lot. Reviewing this period of work, we feel that we mainly learned the following four points:

First, in revolution, we must never forget to study Chairman Mao's works and must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in everything. Ma Tongrong made mistakes repeatedly because he did not hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, did not emphasize proletarian politics, did not seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and did not use Mao Zedong Thought to constantly transform his thoughts and guide his work. Without Chairman Mao's guidance, he could only follow the revisionism and servility of China's Khrushchev. Therefore, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, especially in the face of sharp and tense class struggles.

Second, in revolution, we must never relax our transformation of our worldview. Ma Tongrong made mistakes because his bourgeois worldview, centered around the "self," had not been transformed. Therefore, we must always be vigilant against this great enemy, the "self," and once discovered, we must resolutely fight and thoroughly eliminate it.

Third, in revolution, we must never forget the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Ma Tongrong's mistakes taught us that in the revolutionary journey, taking a liberal attitude, not exposing and fighting against mistakes, allowing bad winds and evil customs to rise, and allowing bad people to gain power is disloyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; in the great class struggle, not fighting against bad people and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party is the greatest betrayal of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Fourth, in revolution, we must never leave the masses and must wholeheartedly serve as good servants of the people. Ma Tongrong's mistakes made us realize that anyone who is high above the masses and alienated from them will definitely make mistakes.

    我们是怎样帮助马同荣同志回到毛主席的革命路线上来的
    六机部政治口帮助马同荣小组
    马同荣同志是六机部的政治部副主任。他过去骄傲自大，严重脱离群众，最近几年犯了不少错误，在这次文化大革命中，又执行了资产阶级反动路线，受到群众的批判斗争。从前年冬天开始，他就靠边站，没有得到群众的信任和谅解。
    我们这个小组是受六机部革命群众的委托，专门负责帮助马同荣同志的。在整个帮助过程中，我们小组始终以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，带着我们自己的和被帮助者的两方面的问题，和马同荣同志一起活学活用毛主席著作，坚决按照毛主席的最新指示办事。先后共计用了四十七天，通过开中小型会议，进行家庭访问，终于帮助马同荣同志提高了觉悟，在灵魂深处爆发革命，回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。革命群众通过了他的检查，并且宣布解放了他。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。
      下定决心，帮助干部
    我们小组成立以后，碰到的第一个问题，就是用什么样的态度来帮助马同荣同志。
    开始时，有些同志因为马同荣同志的错误比较严重，态度又不好，心情比较急躁。他们说，马同荣有一套对付群众的软办法，很难啃。他们主张先开他一、二次小会，如不行，就开大会轰。有的同志不同意，认为这不是对待同志，解决人民内部矛盾的办法。
    带着这些问题，我们学习了毛主席的最新指示。毛主席说：“对于犯了严重错误的干部，只要他们不再坚持错误，认真改正，并为广大革命群众所谅解了之后，仍然可以站起来，参加革命行列。”他老人家还一再教导我们，对犯了错误的同志要“惩前毖后，治病救人”，“一看二帮”，“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”。毛主席的教导，擦亮了我们的眼睛。再看看马同荣同志，出身贫农家庭，历史清楚，入党三十年来，做过不少有益于人民的事，有一定的工作能力。他虽然在文化大革命运动中执行了资产阶级反动路线，过去也犯过一些严重错误，但还不能说是屡教不改，坚持不改，也不是属于反党反社会主义的性质。如果帮助他改正了错误，不但挽救了一个同志，也为党增添了一分力量。
    经过这样反复学习讨论，大家一致认识到，团结、教育干部，是毛主席交给我们无产阶级革命派的光荣任务。帮不帮马同荣同志，这不是对他个人的问题，而是对毛主席最新指示的态度问题，是对毛泽东思想的态度问题，是忠不忠于毛主席和毛主席的革命路线的大问题。我们一致决定，一定要按照正确处理人民内部矛盾的办法，帮助马同荣同志改正错误。同时，我们抱着不帮好马同荣同志，决不罢休的决心，克服了怕难、怕烦的情绪，开始了对马同荣同志的深入、细致而又耐心的帮助工作。
      对症下药，开展三帮
    在端正了我们自己的态度以后，接着就发生了如何具体帮助马同荣同志的问题。毛主席说：“没有调查就没有发言权”，因此，我们第一步工作便是进行调查研究，把凡是能够收集到的有关材料全部收集起来，认真地进行了分析研究。最后终于从他的历史，从他在两条路线斗争的关键时刻的表现，从他在文化大革命中犯错误的事实和目前的活思想中，找到了他的以“私”字为核心的资产阶级世界观没有改造好的病根子。然后根据他的特点，对症下药地从以下三个方面对他进行了具体帮助。
    第一，帮助他端正态度，转变立场。毛主席说：“在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。”马同荣同志的主要毛病之一，就是缺乏诚恳老实的态度。他过去几次犯错误，都没有经过严肃对待，就调动了工作。这次犯错误以后，他对自己的错误所采取的态度又不严肃，头两次检查，都是不痛不痒，光扣帽子，不讲事实，不交代思想。群众揭发批评他，他又不服气，说什么事先没有向他交代清楚。他还特别怕听尖锐的批评意见，有“斗批走”的思想，想等文化大革命结束后离开六机部，缺乏自我革命的决心和害怕群众监督。因此我们在帮助他时，首先帮助他转变立场，端正态度，帮助他用毛泽东思想正确地对待自己，正确地对待群众，起来自我革命。
    例如，针对他怕群众批评的活思想，我们就同他一起学习毛主席“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”的教导；针对他有“斗批走”的思想，我们又同他一起学习了毛主席的指示：“犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了。”并向他严肃指出犯了错误不改的危害性。
    除此以外，我们还和他一起学习了毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件、对共产党员的要求和“老三篇”等光辉著作，并且拿这些条件、要求和张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象同他对照，帮助他检查。这样帮助，使马同荣同志很受感动，他说：“我长期以来，背着老干部的包袱，对自己估价过高。自认为世界观没有问题了，不重视自我改造，这是我最大的毛病。”他表示：“一定要听毛主席的话，把‘怕’字换成‘敢’字，把‘我’字换成‘公’字，把‘相信自己’换成‘相信群众’。绝不能象阿Ｑ那样怕批评，死护癞疮疤。”他还希望我们不要有顾虑，不管我们怎样批评他，他决不会反感。
    第二，帮助他提高觉悟，狠抓根本。毛主席教导我们说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。马同荣同志所以犯错误，主要是他以“私”字为核心的资产阶级世界观没有改造的结果。他出身虽然贫苦，在抗日战争、解放战争和土地改革中，表现也较好，但是进城以后，经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀，开始在生活上追求享受，搞特殊化，接着在重大原则问题的斗争面前，委曲求全，不敢坚持原则，最后发展到在无产阶级文化大革命运动中也失掉了立场，执行了资产阶级反动路线。但是，马同荣同志开始对这些问题一直不认识，不觉悟。他虽然做了一些检查，总是抓不住要害，提不到纲上来。
    我们在帮助过程中，除了帮助他狠亮思想，狠斗
  “私”字以外，根据解放军的经验，对马同荣同志专门进行了“一摆二比三学四查”的阶级教育。一摆他脱离群众和犯错误的事实；二比他目前的生活同工农群众和他在旧社会当苦孩子时生活的差异；三学毛主席在七届二中全会上的报告，特别是毛主席当时谆谆告诫的要预防资产阶级用糖衣炮弹袭击的一段；四查马同荣的思想演变过程和犯错误的原因。我们还同他一起学习和讨论了毛主席关于社会主义社会中矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说，以及无产阶级文化大革命的重要文件，帮助他把自己的错误提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的高度来认识、批判和检查。经过这样反复学习帮助，终于提高了马同荣同志的认识，狠触了他的灵魂。他在检查中十分沉痛地说：“长期以来，我把贪图享受，生活特殊化，当做生活细节，不把它看成是和平演变的突破口，群众批评我，我也一直不理解，不觉悟。实际上政治上的蜕化往往是从生活上开始的。现在大家批评我根本不象贫苦家庭出身，正是打中了我的要害，说明我已经向资产阶级方向蜕变，以至在文化大革命中犯了错误。”最后他表示，一定要接受教训，努力学习毛主席著作，认真改造世界观，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的革命路线，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，一辈子紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在文化大革命和今后的工作中立功赎罪。
    第三，帮助他放下架子，深入群众。毛主席说：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。”马同荣同志过去高高在上，严重脱离群众。文化大革命开展后，长期靠边站，闭门思过，同群众的关系更加疏远。为了帮助他解决好上下级关系和干群关系问题，我们在帮助他学习毛主席关于群众路线的教导，提高他的认识的同时，还遵照毛主席“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的指示，督促他到群众中去，听取意见，接受批评。开始，马同荣同志顾虑较多，生怕下去以后群众不原谅他。经过我们一再鼓励帮助，他才用试探的态度到了对他意见较多的保卫部。不料一到那里，就出乎他的意外，同志们不仅严肃地批评他，诚恳地帮助他，还热情地鼓励他用一分为二的观点正确地对待自己，不要背包袱。广大革命群众实事求是和通情达理的精神，使马同荣同志深受感动。他说：“这下我才真正体会到阶级友爱的温暖，懂得了‘群众是真正的英雄’这一真理的伟大意义。”　　
    现在，马同荣同志和群众的关系已经发生了显著的变化。他不但放下架子，同本部门的群众一起学习，一起斗私批修，还以普通劳动者的姿态出现，每天早起早到，同大家一起扫地打水，有空还找同志们谈心。越是对他意见多的地方，他越是多去。同志们对他的看法，也有了变化，不仅帮助他，谅解他，也信任他，支持他站出来工作。一种新的干群关系，已在六机部政治部开始建立起来。
    帮中有学，
      惩前毖后
    以上就是我们帮助马同荣同志认识错误，改正错误的过程，也是我们和马同荣同志一起活学活用毛主席著作的过程。在这段时间里，我们帮助马同荣同志认识、改正自己的错误，同时，我们自己也从中学到了许多东西。回顾这一段工作，我们觉得主要学到了以下四点：
    一、干革命一刻也不要忘记学习毛主席著作，必须事事照毛主席指示办事。马同荣同志，所以一再犯错误，关键的关键是没有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，没有突出无产阶级政治，没有认真学习毛主席著作，没有用毛泽东思想不断地改造思想，指导工作。离开了毛主席指引的航道，只能奉行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义，奴隶主义。所以，我们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在阶级斗争尖锐紧张的大风浪中更应当如此。
    二、干革命一刻也不能放松对自己世界观的改造。马同荣同志所以犯错误，是他的以“私”字为核心的资产阶级世界观没有改造的结果。所以我们必须时刻警惕“私”字这个大敌，一旦发现就坚决斗争，彻底铲除。
    三、干革命一刻也不要忘记两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。马同荣同志的错误教育了我们，在革命的航程中，采取自由主义的态度，对错误不揭发，不斗争，让歪风邪气上升，让坏人得势，就是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的不忠；在阶级大搏斗中，对坏人、对党内一小撮走资派不斗争，就是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的最大背叛。
    四、干革命一刻也不能脱离群众，必须全心全意地当好人民的勤务员。马同荣同志的错误使我们认识到，谁要是高高在上，脱离了群众，谁就一定要犯错误。
