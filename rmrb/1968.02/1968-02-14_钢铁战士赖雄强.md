One day, Lai Xiongqiang's unit in the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the pseudo-civil defense corps in Anle Village, Linsheng Province. They bravely approached the enemy and, after a brief battle, almost completely annihilated an enemy platoon. They then pursued the fleeing enemy, wiping them out and successfully completing their mission.

On their way back to the base, Lai Xiongqiang's unit encountered a regiment of pseudo-soldiers conducting a "sweep." The enemy forces were four times stronger and had air and artillery support. However, to defend the liberated area, they decided to fight to the end, determined to crush the enemy regiment.

The battle was fierce from the start. The PLA soldiers used trees and mounds for cover, bravely striking the enemy and repeatedly repulsing their counterattacks, leaving the enemy with heavy casualties.

After completing their mission, Lai Xiongqiang's platoon was responsible for covering the retreat. Lai Xiongqiang was at the rear when a bullet struck his leg. The enemy tried to rush forward to force his surrender. Facing the savage enemy, Lai Xiongqiang stood firm, his anger boiling over. He shouted loudly and resolutely, "I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. I know only fighting and victory, not surrender!"

As soon as the words left his mouth, he threw a grenade into the enemy ranks, causing chaos and panic. Then, he fired his last burst from his submachine gun, killing a group of enemies. When his ammunition ran out, he smashed his submachine gun to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. The cowardly enemies were stunned by Lai Xiongqiang's fearless heroism, none daring to approach him, and instead, they cowered in the distance, firing wildly.

For the cause of the people's liberation, Lai Xiongqiang made the ultimate sacrifice. His lofty and brave spirit will forever inspire his comrades to press forward courageously.

    钢铁战士赖雄强
    一天，赖雄强所在的解放军某单位对林同省安乐村伪民卫队进行袭击。他们勇敢地逼近敌人，经过暂短的战斗，就几乎全歼了敌人一个排。随后，他们乘胜追击，全歼了残敌，胜利地完成了袭击任务。
    在返回根据地的途中，赖雄强的单位遇上了正在进行“扫荡”的一营伪军。敌人的力量比自己大四倍，又有许多飞机大炮掩护。但是，为了保卫解放区，他们决心不怕牺牲，坚决打垮这营敌军。
    战斗一开始就进行得非常激烈。解放军战士利用树木、土堆作掩护，英勇地打击敌人，并一次又一次地击退了敌人的反扑，把敌人打得死伤累累。
    战斗任务完成之后，赖雄强所在的排负责掩护撤退，赖雄强走在最后，突然一颗子弹飞来，他的腿部不幸负了伤。敌人企图涌上来逼他投降。面对着野兽般的凶恶敌人，赖雄强威武不屈，怒不可遏，斩钉截铁地高声喊道：“我是解放军战士，只懂得战斗和胜利，不懂得投降！”
    话声刚落，他扔出的一颗手榴弹就在敌群中开了花，炸得敌人七零八落，鬼哭狼嚎。接着他扣动冲锋枪扳机，以最后一排子弹，歼灭了一批敌人。子弹打完了，他就把冲锋枪砸坏，不使武器落入敌人手中。怯懦的敌人被赖雄强这种大无畏的英雄气概吓得目瞪口呆，没有一个敢上去捉他，而畏缩地躲在远处向他乱肆射击。
    为了人民的解放事业，赖雄强光荣牺牲了。他那崇高的英勇精神，永远鼓舞战友们奋勇前进。
