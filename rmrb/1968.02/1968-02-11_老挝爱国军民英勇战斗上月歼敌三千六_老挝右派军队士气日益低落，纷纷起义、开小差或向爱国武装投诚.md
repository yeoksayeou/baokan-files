Patriotic soldiers and civilians in Laos, with high hatred for the enemy, have continuously and fiercely struck the enemy in various parts of the country this January, achieving a glorious victory of eliminating 3,619 enemies.

The report said that during this period, the patriotic soldiers and civilians in Laos killed 1,451 enemies, wounded 81, and captured or forced the surrender of 2,087. In addition, the patriotic soldiers and civilians in Laos also shot down and destroyed 14 enemy aircraft, sank 3 enemy motorboats and patrol boats, and seized 1,187 various weapons, including 74 cannons of various calibers and 123 light and heavy machine guns.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Kang Kai, the Patriotic Liberation Forces in Luang Prabang Province, with the enthusiastic support of the local people, launched a fierce attack on the right-wing military's 27th and 28th battalion command posts, a company of enemy troops guarding the Mangxai Airport, and two enemy military bases near Mangxai Town at dawn on January 21. They eliminated 46 enemies, including killing 4 American soldiers and 2 right-wing officers, seized a large number of enemy weapons and military supplies, and liberated the Mangxai area.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Kang Kai on February 7, under the heavy blows of the patriotic soldiers and civilians in Laos, the morale of the right-wing military in Laos is increasingly declining. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 3,000 right-wing military personnel in Laos either mutinied, deserted, or surrendered to the patriotic armed forces last year.

In the past year, there have been five relatively large-scale mutinies in the right-wing military in Laos, four of which occurred in Sayaboury Province. Before these mutinies, the soldiers took their weapons and surrendered to the patriotic armed forces in Laos, killing many right-wing diehards and thugs. On the battlefield in Laos, more and more right-wing military officers and soldiers are deserting and surrendering. In July last year alone, more than 230 right-wing military officers and soldiers deserted, and another 130 surrendered to the patriotic armed forces.

    老挝右派军队士气日益低落，纷纷起义、开小差或向爱国武装投诚
    新华社康开八日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：英勇善战的老挝爱国军民，怀着对敌人的高度仇恨，今年一月份在全国各地连续地、狠狠地打击敌人，取得了歼敌三千六百一十九名的辉煌胜利。
    报道说，老挝爱国军民在这期间共打死敌人一千四百五十一名，打伤八十一名，俘虏和迫降二千零八十七名。此外，老挝爱国军民还击落击毁敌机十四架，击沉敌人汽艇和机动艇三艘，缴获各种武器一千一百八十七件，其中包括各种口径的炮七十四门、轻重机枪一百二十三挺。
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝琅勃拉邦省解放武装力量在当地人民的热情支持下，于一月二十一日凌晨，以猛烈的攻势同时进攻芒显地区的右派军队第二十七和第二十八营指挥所、守卫芒显机场的一连敌人以及芒显镇附近的两个敌军驻地，共消灭敌人四十六名，其中包括打死美军四名和伪军官二名，缴获敌人大批武器和军用物资，解放了芒显地区。
    据新华社康开七日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，在老挝爱国军民的沉重打击下，老挝右派军队士气日益低落。据不完全统计，去年老挝右派军队中起义、开小差或向老挝爱国武装力量投诚的近三千人。
    在过去的一年中，老挝右派军队举行较大规模的起义就有五次，其中的四次发生在萨耶武里省。这些起义的军队在携械向老挝爱国武装力量投诚之前，还打死了许多右派的顽固分子和恶棍。在老挝战场上，右派军队官兵开小差和投降的也越来越多。仅在去年七月份，就有二百三十多名右派军队官兵开小差，另有一百三十多名向爱国武装力量投降。（附图片）
