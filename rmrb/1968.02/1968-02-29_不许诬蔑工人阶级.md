	Do Not Slander the Working Class
	Worker Zhang Caijin

	Chinese Khrushchev has consistently opposed the emphasis on proletarian politics and has madly advocated "material incentives" and "bonus as the commander." He rants about how workers "won't have enough production enthusiasm without a raise, and won't produce well for you."

	This is the greatest slander against our working class. We workers are the masters of the state. We have boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and are unyieldingly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our life's purpose is to realize communism throughout the world. We are in the workshop, but our hearts are with the country and our eyes are on the world. We labor for the revolution, with the greatest production enthusiasm. We work not for the money.

	Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy that "production enthusiasm comes only with a raise" is a fallacy of restoring capitalism. The production enthusiasm stimulated by money is not socialist enthusiasm, but individualist enthusiasm. Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "raising wages" is actually an attempt to use economic bribery and small favors to cater to the psychology of a few backward elements, to corrupt our working class's revolutionary will, and to lead us astray into the capitalist path. "Raising wages" is an attempt to make us see only our immediate personal interests, forgetting the great interests of the working class, forgetting class struggle, forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, forgetting our great historical mission as the proletariat to liberate all of humanity, and allowing them to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism.

	Before the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in my factory faithfully carried out Chinese Khrushchev's black directives, vigorously promoting "material incentives" and "bonus as the commander," which had a pernicious influence. It poisoned the minds of some workers, allowing the "self" to grow, temporarily creating a wrong trend of chasing bonuses, causing disunity among workers, and affecting production.

	Since the Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and with the help of the 8341 Unit stationed in the factory, all revolutionary workers in the factory have launched a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We workers do not rely on "material incentives" but on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to "grasp revolution and promote production," bringing about great changes in the entire factory. For example, the knitting workshop comrades, through a fierce struggle against "self," strengthened unity within the team, carried forward the spirit of collectivism, and better released the socialist enthusiasm of the worker masses. The entire factory has achieved great successes in production and technological innovation.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul. This means that we workers must always emphasize proletarian politics, put revolution in the first place, and use revolution to command production. We must insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insist on "struggle against self and criticize revisionism," thoroughly criticize Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary economism, and ensure that our socialist economy continues to consolidate and develop, guaranteeing that our proletarian heaven remains unchanging for ten thousand generations.

### 不许诬蔑工人阶级

    不许诬蔑工人阶级
    工人　张才钦
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对突出无产阶级政治，疯狂地鼓吹“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”的反革命经济主义。他胡说什么工人“不加点钱，生产积极性不够，不好好给你生产”。
    这是对我们工人阶级的最大诬蔑。我们工人阶级是国家的主人。我们无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线。我们的生活目的，是为了在全世界实现共产主义。我们身在车间，心怀祖国，放眼世界。我们为革命而劳动，有着最大的生产积极性。我们劳动，决不是为了那几个钱。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“加点钱”才有“生产积极性”的谬论，是复辟资本主义的谬论。用钱刺激出来的生产积极性，根本不是社会主义积极性，而是个人主义积极性。中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“加点钱”，实际上是想用经济收买的手段，用小恩小惠的方法，来迎合少数落后群众的心理，腐蚀我们工人阶级的革命意志，把我们拉向资本主义邪道。“加点钱”，就是企图让我们只看到眼前的个人私利，而忘记工人阶级的远大的利益，忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记我们无产阶级肩负的解放全人类的伟大历史使命，而听任他们颠覆我国无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。
    在无产阶级文化大革命以前，我厂党内一小撮走资派忠实地贯彻执行中国赫鲁晓夫的黑指示，大肆推行“物质刺激”和“奖金挂帅”，产生了恶劣的影响。它毒害了少数职工的思想，使“私”字滋长，一度形成了一股追求奖金的歪风，造成了职工之间的不团结，影响了生产。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，在驻厂支左的八三四一部队的帮助下，全厂革命职工掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。我们工人不靠“物质刺激”，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，“抓革命，促生产”，使全厂发生了很大的变化。例如，针织车间的同志，通过狠斗“私”字，加强了组内团结，发扬了集体主义精神，更好地发挥工人群众的社会主义积极性。全厂在生产和技术革新上，都取得很大成绩。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：政治是统帅，是灵魂。这就是说，我们工人时时事事都要突出无产阶级政治，要把革命放在第一位，用革命统帅生产。我们要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚持“斗私，批修”，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命经济主义，使社会主义经济不断巩固和发展，保证我们无产阶级的江山千秋万代永不变色。
