The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in China's rural areas have enthusiastically responded to and earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have taken "Criticize Revisionism, Repudiate Self" as their guiding principle and have organized various types of study classes. The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated countless villages. The spiritual outlook of the broad masses of peasants is undergoing tremendous changes.

How to deal with scattered residences? Organize study classes for three or two households; what about during busy farming seasons? Organize study classes in the fields...

Their deepest realization is: "There is no trick to running study classes; loyalty to Chairman Mao is the key to success." With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, one can truly achieve the integration of learning and application, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, turn the great Mao Zedong Thought into conscious revolutionary actions, and push the great proletarian cultural revolution in rural areas from victory to new victories.

	There is No Trick to Running Study Classes; Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the Key to Success

Recently, the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee investigated and summarized the Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by three units, including the Gangdong Production Brigade of Wanggezhuang People's Commune in Laoshan County. They concluded that the main experience in running good study classes lies in the word "loyalty." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants say: "There is no trick to running study classes; loyalty to Chairman Mao is the key to success."

The three units unanimously agreed that to run good part-time study classes, one must first address the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. One must always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and always loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. To this end, each study class (group) first extensively discusses Chairman Mao's great wisdom, arousing the class feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao among the students; extensively studies Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recognizing the excellent situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution; extensively discusses the tasks of the rural cultural revolution this winter and next spring, clarifying specific struggle goals; extensively discusses the great significance of organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes and the advanced experiences from other places; extensively discusses class struggle and the struggle between the two lines; recalls the bitterness of the old society, comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; recalls the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line, comparing it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Through these educational activities, the class consciousness of the commune members has been greatly heightened, arousing deep class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought among the commune members, and promoting the initiative and self-awareness of the commune members in organizing Mao Zedong Thought part-time study classes.

An old poor peasant said: "Chairman Mao always thinks of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao's books are our lifeline. If we don't study them, who will? If we don't organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, who will?" Another poor peasant said: "We will organize study classes every day, every month, every year, and pass them down from generation to generation." Thus, organizing Mao Zedong Thought part-time study classes has become an urgent demand of the broad masses of commune members. Various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes (groups) have quickly sprung up. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel:

    我国农村的广大贫下中农和革命干部，对毛主席发出的最新指示，热烈响应，认真贯彻。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，办起了各种类型的学习班。毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了千村万户。广大农民的精神面貌，正在发生巨大的变化。
    居住分散怎么办？办三家两户的学习班；农忙时怎么办？办田头学习班；……
    他们最深刻的体会是：“办学习班没有巧，忠于毛主席就能办好”。有了对毛主席和对毛泽东思想的无限忠心，才能真正做到学用结合，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把伟大的毛泽东思想变为自觉的革命行动，推动农村无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向新的胜利。

    “办学习班没有巧，忠于毛主席就能办好”
    最近，青岛市革命委员会对崂山县王哥庄公社港东大队等三个单位办的毛泽东思想学习班进行了调查总结，提出办好学习班的一条主要经验在于一个“忠”字。广大贫下中农说：“办学习班没有巧，忠于毛主席就能办好。”
    三个单位一致认为，办好业余学习班，必须首先解决对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。为此，各个学习班（组）首先大讲毛主席的英明伟大，激发学员对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，大学毛主席的最新指示，认清无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势；大讲今冬明春农村文化大革命的任务，明确具体奋斗目标；大讲大办毛泽东思想学习班的伟大意义和外地的先进经验；大讲阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争；忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜。通过这些教育活动，大大提高了社员的阶级觉悟，激发了社员对毛主席和毛泽东思想的深厚的阶级感情，促进了社员大办毛泽东思想业余学习班的积极性和自觉性。
    一位老贫农社员说：“毛主席处处为咱们贫下中农着想，毛主席的书是咱们的命根子，咱们不学谁学？毛泽东思想学习班咱们不办谁办？”另一位贫农社员说：“学习班我们要天天办，月月办，年年办，代代办，一代一代往下传。”这样，大办毛泽东思想业余学习班就成了广大社员的迫切要求，各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班（组）迅速办了起来。广大贫下中农深有感受地说：
  “办学习班没有巧，忠于毛主席就能办好。”
