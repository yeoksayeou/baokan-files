With unparalleled heroic spirit, the people and soldiers of South Vietnam have launched a powerful offensive in the new year. They are fighting with extraordinary tenacity, relentlessly pressing on, and achieving remarkable victories. In recent days, the people and soldiers in the south have continued to fight bravely in the southern regions of Saigon City and the surrounding provinces, as well as in the northern regions of Hue City and other areas, routing the U.S. puppet forces and leaving them in disarray.

In the stronghold of the U.S. puppet regime in Saigon City and the surrounding areas, the People's Liberation Armed Forces have been highly active, launching frequent attacks. On the night of the 9th and the early hours of the 10th, the liberation army again raided an ammunition depot at the northern end of the U.S. military's New Mountain Air Base and dealt a heavy blow to the ground defenders. Until the afternoon of the next day, the ammunition depot was still exploding, with the deafening roar shaking the entire city of Saigon. At the same time, the liberation forces also attacked a television center of the U.S. puppet regime in the heart of Saigon City and a stronghold just one kilometer away from the "presidential palace," as well as other strongholds. In the racetrack at Phu Tho in the suburbs, the liberation army engaged in fierce combat with the U.S. 199th Light Infantry Division. The people of Saigon continue to control many areas of the city, striking fear into the hearts of the American aggressors.

Faced with the powerful offensive of the people of Saigon, the American aggressors often ignore the pleas for help from the puppet forces, fully exposing their panic-stricken and disheveled state. A puppet county chief in Go Dau County north of Saigon complained about their defeat and retreat, saying, "I knelt down and begged the Americans for help, but they refused."

According to another report, on the 6th, the people of Saigon's 7th District surrounded and annihilated a U.S. company. That evening, they captured another enemy stronghold in the same district, wiping out an entire puppet field police company.

The people of Gia Dinh Province, on the outskirts of Saigon, bravely repulsed the enemy's counterattacks on the 5th and 6th, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy using bayonets and grenades. They annihilated over 900 puppet soldiers, including an entire puppet marine corps battalion, a reinforced parachute battalion, and an armored battalion. They also destroyed or damaged 13 armored vehicles and shot down one enemy aircraft.

The people of Go Cong District in Gia Dinh Province launched their second attack on the county seat since the new year on the 6th, once again seizing control of the town and destroying the puppet police headquarters, the puppet intelligence agency, and many outposts. Currently, the people of Go Cong, An Phu, Ho Men, and Go Dau districts in Gia Dinh Province are still fighting tenaciously and continuing to attack other enemy targets.

In the neighboring province of Binh Duong, the People's Liberation Armed Forces bombarded the Binh Duong U.S. Air Force Base twice, in the early hours of the 9th and the 11th, destroying a batch of U.S. aircraft and killing a number of U.S. soldiers. Earlier, on the morning of the 7th, the people in the northern part of the province attacked many "strategic hamlets" near Ba Ria City and dealt a heavy blow to the enemy reinforcements, annihilating one company and severely wounding two companies. They also damaged several armored vehicles and hit two helicopters, causing them to catch fire.

The people of Tay Ninh Province north of Saigon annihilated a U.S. infantry battalion and an armored company over two days, the 6th and 8th, destroying 24 armored vehicles and shooting down five enemy aircraft.

On the morning of the 6th, the enemy dispatched helicopters to drop a U.S. 1st Infantry Division battalion in the area east of Bau Bang in Tay Ninh Province and sent a U.S. armored company from Bau Bang to try to stop the fierce advance of the people of Tay Ninh Province. A unit of the liberation army, taking advantage of the enemy's lack of footing, launched a fierce attack, annihilating a U.S. armored company, destroying six armored vehicles, and shooting down five helicopters. In the early hours of the 8th, the liberation army of Tay Ninh Province took the initiative to launch a fierce attack and seized control of a U.S. stronghold, annihilating over 500 defenders, including a U.S. infantry battalion. They also destroyed 18 armored vehicles.

In the southernmost province of Phu Quoc, the local people bravely charged into the provincial capital of Phu Quoc City on the 10th. The liberation forces engaged in a day-long street battle with the enemy, killing a large number of enemy soldiers.

In the ancient city of Hue in the northern part of South Vietnam, the glorious flag of the National Liberation Front is still proudly flying over the citadel. After the repeated failures of the U.S. puppet regime's attempts to launch counterattacks with puppet forces, the American aggressors had to take personal action, but they met with equally shameful outcomes. On the 9th, a convoy of 15 vehicles from the U.S. Marine Corps, escorted by armored vehicles, set out from the Phu Bai base about 15 kilometers from Hue to reinforce the defenders of Hue. Along the way, they were hit by landmines and artillery fire from the liberation army, with almost all their vehicles destroyed and heavy casualties among the U.S. soldiers. Currently, the liberation army still controls this road and has blown up 12 bridges on the main road from Hue to Da Nang. Two of the helicopters sent to rescue the enemy were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The U.S. aggressors, unable to do anything about the liberation army that firmly controls the vast areas of Hue, desperately try to struggle to the death with indiscriminate bombing.

According to another report, the people of Hue continued to attack the enemy within the city and intercept enemy reinforcements on the 7th and 8th, annihilating 400 enemy soldiers, including 300 U.S. aggressors, and a puppet battalion and company. They also destroyed 36 enemy vehicles and sank five ships. The people of Hue City are jubilant over the victories achieved since the new year and are actively building fortifications and trenches, strongly supporting the liberation army in its fight against the enemy. The people in the surrounding rural areas are also fearless in the face of hardships, supporting the people of Hue City from all sides, defending and expanding the victories. Thousands of people have enthusiastically joined the revolutionary armed forces and self-defense units, rushing to the battlefield to fight the enemy.

On the highly publicized battlefield of Quang Tri Province, the liberation army launched a fierce artillery attack on the Khe Sanh U.S. base on the 10th, shooting down and damaging one U.S. C-130 Hercules transport aircraft each, which were providing air support to the besieged U.S. forces. As a result, the airfield at this base had to be closed. Thus, the Khe Sanh U.S. base, which has already been cut off by land, is now in an even more precarious situation.

In the Central Highlands of Pleiku, the liberation army shelled the Hollo Army Camp on the 10th, causing serious damage to the so-called "nerve center" of the U.S. military's electronic facilities in the Central Highlands, resulting in heavy casualties among the U.S. soldiers.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have heavily besieged the Khe Sanh U.S. base and continuously launched fierce attacks. The besieged U.S. aggressors are terrified, fearing day and night that shells will fall on their heads. The picture shows the U.S. soldiers at Khe Sanh in a state of panic when attacked by the people and soldiers of South Vietnam, fleeing in all directions, truly with nowhere to go.

In the face of the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors in Hue are trembling with fear, in a state of chaos, huddling behind tanks for their lives.

    越南南方军民越战越勇越战越强
    继续控制西贡、顺化的许多地区，狠揍敌人　重重包围溪山美军基地，猛轰机场
    越南人民坚持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。
    毛泽东
    新华社河内十一日电　以无与伦比的豪迈气概发动新春强大攻势的越南南方军民，正在以极其顽强的战斗意志，再接再厉，连续奋战，屡建奇功。几天来，南方军民继续在南部的西贡市和西贡周围各省以及北部的顺化市和其他地方英勇战斗，把美伪军打得落花流水，狼狈不堪。
    在美伪集团的老巢西贡市和周围地区，人民解放武装力量连日来活动频繁，不断出击。九日夜间和十日凌晨，解放军又袭击了美军新山一空军基地北端的一个弹药库，并狠揍地面守敌。直到第二天下午，弹药库还在爆炸，轰隆隆的巨响震动了整个西贡市。与此同时，解放武装力量还袭击了在西贡市中心的美伪集团一个电视中心和距离伪“总统府”只有一千米的一个据点及其他据点。在堤岸的富寿赛马场，解放军同美国第一九九轻步兵师的军队展开了激战。西贡军民迄今继续控制市区许多地方，杀得美国强盗惊慌失措、惶惶不安。美国“大使”邦克忧心忡忡哀叹：“考验的时候还没有结束，漫长的危险时期还在前头”。
    在西贡军民的强大攻势面前，美国强盗对伪军的求救往往置之不理，充分暴露了他们丧魂失魄的狼狈相。西贡北面守德县的一名伪县长在谈到他们被打得狼狈而逃时抱怨说：“我跪下来乞求美国人给我援助，但是他们拒绝了。”
    另据报道，西贡市军民六日在第七区围攻美军一个单位时歼灭了美军一个连。当天晚间，又在这个区攻克敌人一个据点，全歼一个伪野战警察连。
    西贡外围的嘉定省军民五日和六日英勇回击敌人的反扑，用刺刀和手雷同敌人大打白刃战，歼灭伪军九百多名，包括全歼伪海军陆战队一个营、一个伞兵加强营和一个装甲营，击毁击伤装甲车十三辆，击落敌机一架。
    威震南越的嘉定省古芝县军民六日又对这个县县城发动新春以来的第二次进攻，再次控制了这座县城，捣毁了伪警察机关、伪情报机关以及许多个哨所。目前，嘉定省古芝、鹅邑、霍门和守德等县军民仍在继续顽强战斗，并不断进攻敌人的其他目标。
    在紧靠西贡的边和省，人民解放武装力量，在九日凌晨和十一日凌晨，又两次炮击了边和美军空军基地，击毁了一批美机，杀伤了一批美军。在这之前的七日早晨，这个省北部军民袭击了巴拉市附近的许多“战略村”，并痛击前去增援的敌军，歼敌一个连，重创两个连，击伤装甲车多辆，击中起火直升飞机两架。
    西贡北面土龙木省的军民六日和八日两天，歼灭美军一个步兵营和一个装甲连，击毁装甲车二十四辆，击落敌机五架。
    六日上午，敌人派遣直升飞机在土龙木省保邦以东的地区空投美国第一步兵师的一个步兵营，同时从保邦调来美军一个装甲连，妄图阻挠土龙木省军民的猛烈进攻。解放军的一个单位趁着美军尚未站稳脚跟，就发起猛烈攻击，歼灭美军一个装甲连，击毁装甲车六辆，击落直升飞机五架。八日凌晨，土龙木省解放军又主动出击，猛烈袭击并控制了美国侵略军的一个阵地，全歼守敌五百多名，其中包括美军一个步兵营，击毁装甲车十八辆。
    在南部南端的薄寮省，当地军民十日勇猛地冲进省会薄寮市，解放武装力量同敌军进行了一整天的浴血巷战，杀伤了一大批敌军。
    在越南南方北部的古城顺化市，民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜至今仍在城堡上骄傲地飘扬。在美伪集团不断出动伪军进行反扑遭到失败之后，美国强盗不得不亲自出马，赤膊上阵。可是他们也遭到了同样可耻的下场。九日，美国海军陆战队的一支由十五辆车组成的车队，在装甲车的护送下从顺化附近约十五公里的芙拜基地出发企图增援顺化守敌，途中遭到了解放军的地雷爆炸和炮击，车辆几乎全部被击毁，美军伤亡惨重。目前解放军仍控制着这条公路，并把顺化通往岘港的主要公路上的十二座桥炸断。美军出动去救援的直升飞机，有两架被高射炮击落。美国侵略军对牢牢控制顺化广大地区的解放军无可奈何，妄图用狂轰滥炸来进行垂死挣扎。
    另据报道，顺化军民七日和八日继续不断进攻市内的敌人和截击前去援救的敌军，歼灭包括美国侵略军三百名在内的四百名敌军以及伪军一个营和一个连，击毁敌军车三十六辆，击沉舰艇五艘。顺化市人民对新春以来已取得的胜利欢欣鼓舞，正在积极修筑工事战壕，大力支援解放军杀敌。附近农村地区人民也不畏艰险，从各方面支援顺化市军民，保卫和发展胜利，数以千计的人民还踊跃加入革命武装力量和自卫队，奔赴战场杀敌。
    在举世瞩目的广治省溪山战场，解放军十日又猛烈炮击溪山美军基地，并击落击伤给被围困的美军进行空援的美国Ｃ—130巨型运输机各一架，并且使这个基地的机场被迫宣告关闭。这样，陆路早已被切断了的溪山美军基地更是处在岌岌可危的困境中。
    在中部高原的波来古，解放军十日炮轰了霍洛威美军营地，使这个被称为美军在中部高原的“神经中心”电子设施基地遭到严重破坏，大批美军伤亡。（附图片）
    越南南方人民解放武装力量重重围困溪山美军基地并接连不断地猛烈轰击。被围困的美国侵略军，吓得胆战心惊，日夜担心炮弹落到他们头上。图为溪山美军在遭到越南南方军民的袭击时，吓得魂不附体，到处逃窜，真是上天无路，入地无门。新华社发（传真照片）
