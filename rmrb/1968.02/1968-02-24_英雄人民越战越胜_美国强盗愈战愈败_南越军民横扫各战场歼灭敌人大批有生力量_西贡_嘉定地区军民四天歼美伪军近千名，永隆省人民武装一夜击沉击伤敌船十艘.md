The people's armed forces in the province of Phuoc Long sank and damaged ten enemy ships in one night.

In the Saigon-Cho Lon region, the military and civilian population launched seven attacks on the New Mountain One Airbase, two attacks on the puppet police headquarters and the Saigon puppet police station, and continuously assaulted enemy strongholds near the city of Cu Chi from February 18 to 21.

At 10:00 AM, the people's liberation armed forces launched a fierce artillery bombardment on the Vinh Port. The shells accurately hit the rear base of the U.S. Marine Corps' 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment, the parking lot of the puppet amphibious armored vehicles, and the area where the puppet naval fleet was stationed, killing and wounding many U.S. and puppet troops.

After two days of heroic fighting, they achieved significant victories, annihilating nearly 300 enemy troops, destroying or damaging 14 armored vehicles, burning down many fuel and ammunition depots, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

In this battle, soon after the sound of attacking guns and cannons, the people's liberation armed forces quickly destroyed the enemy's various strongholds, captured the military command post, destroyed the communication center, occupied the airport, destroyed the puppet provincial government office, raided the prison, and controlled many districts. By noon on February 19, the military and civilian population of Phuoc Long Province had almost completely controlled Phuoc Long City.

While clearing the remaining enemy in the city, the military and civilian population of Phuoc Long Province also intercepted the enemy's reinforcements many times, severely damaging a U.S. company and annihilating a large number of puppet troops.

In the early hours of February 18, the people's liberation armed forces in Long An Province simultaneously attacked the Co Gia stronghold and the De Vui military command post, quickly surrounding the U.S. military quarters, the puppet county chief's stronghold, and many other enemy strongholds. Under the fierce attack of the people's liberation armed forces, a company of puppet self-defense forces guarding the Co Gia Sugar Factory and the U.S. military quarters surrendered in the afternoon of the same day. The 1,500 workers of the Co Gia Sugar Factory, together with the troops, arrested over 100 traitorous scoundrels and puppet police who attempted to escape. The local people also organized armed self-defense teams to patrol and guard various streets, maintaining order.

The local forces in the province of Tra Vinh, in coordination with the attack on the Co Gia stronghold, ambushed the 3rd and 4th battalions of the 46th Regiment of the puppet 25th Division on the 13th National Highway in the commune of Phu Tho on February 18, annihilating an entire company and the command post of the 4th Battalion. A total of 160 U.S. and puppet troops were killed and wounded, including the battalion commander and deputy commander of the 4th Battalion.
