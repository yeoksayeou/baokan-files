Now, spring plowing is not far away, but I have seen that some nearby production teams have not yet started repairing their broken plows, harrows, and cart wheels. If this continues, it will inevitably affect the progress of spring plowing.

To ensure that spring plowing is carried out without missing the agricultural season, I suggest that all levels of agricultural production leadership teams pay attention to this issue, promptly repair the farm tools, and make preparations for spring plowing.

    及早修好农具
    现在，离春耕已经不远了，但是我看到附近一些生产队使坏了的犁、耙、车脚等，还没有动手修理。这样，到春耕时，势必影响生产的进行。
    为了不违农时地进行春耕生产，我建议农村各级生产领导班子重视这个问题，抓紧整修农具，为春耕生产作好准备。
