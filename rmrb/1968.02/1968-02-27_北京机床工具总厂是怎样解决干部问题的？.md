In units where revolutionary great alliances have been achieved, how can the cadre problem be correctly solved to create conditions for further achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination? The approach and experience of the revolutionary rebels of Beijing Machine Tool Factory are: actively working with the stationed People's Liberation Army to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, relying closely on the masses, and adopting various forms to provide specific assistance to cadres.

Eliminating Selfishness and Factionalism

The two revolutionary mass organizations of Beijing Machine Tool Factory, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China regions, achieved revolutionary great alliances on September 20th of last year and established the Revolutionary Rebels Great Alliance Committee. Following this, they began to address the cadre problem. The committee members believed that to solve the cadre problem well, the first step is to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes to fight against selfishness and factionalism; otherwise, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the cadre problem would be difficult to implement.

Originally, the two factions of revolutionary masses in this factory had no fundamental disagreements over some of the main cadres at the factory level. However, due to selfishness and factionalism, not only did they never publicly express their opinions, but even within their own organizations, they dared not exchange views, fearing that if the information leaked, the opposing faction would seize the opportunity to make an issue out of it. Although both factions agreed that the former factory director was not a target for overthrow, they feared that their own faction's masses would label them as "rightist," and the opposing faction would label their organization as "conservative." Instead of actively helping this director to stand up quickly, they instructed their faction's masses to definitely "criticize and denounce" him.

To address these concerns in solving the cadre problem, the committee members first sat together to exchange views and opinions on the main cadres, seriously studying and discussing Chairman Mao's instructions on the cadre problem. Then, together with the stationed People's Liberation Army, they held a three-in-one combination Mao Zedong Thought study class. Through exposing selfishness and fighting factionalism, they finally reached a unified understanding. They said: "Fear of this and that is an expression of selfishness. To liberate revolutionary cadres, one must first liberate oneself from selfishness."

Concrete Analysis, Easier First, Harder Later

Where should one start to solve the cadre problem? The committee members followed Chairman Mao's teachings and first conducted a concrete analysis of cadres who had made mistakes: were their mistakes one-time incidents or consistent? Were they minor personal issues or major political issues? Were they internal contradictions among the people or contradictions between us and the enemy? Based on the results of this analysis, they categorized and prioritized the main cadres at the factory level and proposed preliminary solutions. For those with good political integrity or who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, or who had made serious mistakes before the Cultural Revolution, they arranged for them to have the opportunity to make public self-criticisms and listen to the masses' criticisms and assistance. For those with complex issues that were temporarily unclear, they set them aside and focused their efforts on solving the remaining issues.

Based on this categorization and prioritization, they adopted a method of solving issues from easier to harder. The former factory director and the deputy director of the political department, with clear histories and generally good work, although they had executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, had relatively quick and good recognition. Therefore, they were the first to be liberated. Some cadres, due to some issues that were temporarily unclear, were arranged to be handled last. In this way, they managed to quickly liberate the vast majority of revolutionary cadres without acting hastily.

Mobilizing the Masses, Focusing on Assistance

How to help the liberated cadres make more profound self-criticisms and gain the understanding and trust of the masses is the key to solving the cadre problem well. For this, the committee members adopted various forms, closely relying on the masses, and always focused on the "assistance" aspect.

First, they organized small assistance meetings, with relevant cadres and masses participating, to provide opinions on the initial self-criticisms of the liberated cadres, helping them to raise their awareness. Then, they held self-criticisms at mass meetings. Based on the self-criticisms and the opinions of the masses, they provided targeted assistance. To thoroughly resolve the estrangement between cadres and the masses, and to help cadres correctly treat themselves and correctly treat the masses, they also arranged for these main cadres to go to the grassroots level to study, discuss, and engage in activities with the masses. Where the grassroots units had more opinions about a cadre, they went there first, and then rotated through all grassroots units to meet and talk with the masses. The masses reflected that this method was good and in line with Chairman Mao's teaching: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and work together with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." The cadres also said, "We have tasted the sweetness."

Cannot "Wait and See," Must Shoulder Responsibilities

On the eve of achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination, among the already liberated main cadres, there was a widespread "wait and see" mentality: "If you come to combine, then work; if you don't come to combine, then it's over." They were unwilling to proactively step forward to promote revolution and production. The committee members analyzed these cadres' active thoughts of seeking liberation but not combination and adopted various methods to help them truly stand up in thought. First, they organized these cadres to deeply study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds. Chairman Mao's teachings on "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the interests of the people," the glorious images of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, who dedicated their lives to the revolution, and the indomitable spirit of the Old Man Moving Mountains, who overcame all difficulties, gave them great education. At the same time, they organized these cadres to deeply recall the Party's many years of cultivation and education, to deeply discuss the revolutionary masses' help and expectations, giving them great courage. Some cadres said: "The revolutionary masses helped us stand up, wanting us to shoulder the revolutionary burden, but we wanted to stand by and watch, which is too disappointing to Chairman Mao!" They all expressed their determination to work together with the revolutionary masses and follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

    北京机床工具总厂是怎样解决干部问题的？
    在已经实现革命大联合的单位，怎样正确地解决干部问题，为进一步实现革命三结合创造条件？北京机床工具总厂无产阶级革命派的做法和经验是：积极同驻厂的解放军一起，大办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，紧紧依靠群众，采取各种形式，对干部进行具体帮助。
    去掉私心和派性
    北京机床工具总厂的两个革命群众组织，在毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的最新指示下达后，于去年九月二十日，就实现了革命大联合，成立了无产阶级革命派大联合委员会。接着，他们着手解决干部问题。大联委的同志认为，要解决好干部问题，首先要举办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私心，斗派性，否则，毛主席有关干部问题的最新指示就难以落实。
    原来，这个厂的两派革命群众组织，对厂级的一些主要干部，并没有什么根本的分歧。但是，由于私心和派性作怪，不用说双方从来没有公开表示过态度；就是在本组织内部，也不敢交换意见，怕走漏消息后让对方抓住“辫子”做文章。对原总厂厂长虽然双方都认为他不是打倒对象，但是由于怕本组织的群众说自己“右倾”，怕对方说自己的组织“保守”。他们不是积极帮助这个厂长尽快地站出来，反而布置本组织的群众一定要把他“批倒批臭”。
    为了解决在干部问题上的这些思想顾虑，大联委的同志首先坐在一起交换对主要干部的看法和意见，认真学习、讨论毛主席有关干部问题的指示。然后，和驻厂的解放军一起，举办了三结合的毛泽东思想学习班。通过亮私心，斗派性，终于取得了统一认识。他们说：“怕这怕那都是私字的表现。要解放革命干部，必须先把自己从私字中解放出来。”
    具体分析　先易后难
    从哪里下手解决干部问题呢？大联委的同志遵照毛主席的教导，首先对犯错误的干部进行了具体分析：他们的错误是一时一事，还是一贯的？是生活小节，还是政治大节？是人民内部矛盾，还是敌我矛盾？根据这种分析的结果，他们把厂级的主要干部分类排队，并提出初步的解决办法。凡是大节好的，或在文化大革命中执行过资产阶级反动路线，或在文化大革命前犯有严重错误的干部，都给他们安排公开检查的机会，听取群众的批评和帮助。对问题复杂，暂时搞不清楚的干部，先放在一边，最后集中力量解决。
    根据这样的分类排队，他们采取了由易到难、逐步解决的办法。原厂长和政治部副主任，历史清楚，整个工作较好，文化大革命初期虽然执行了资产阶级反动路线，但是认识比较快，也比较好，因此，最先得到解放。有的干部因为有些问题一时搞不清楚，就安排在最后处理。这样，做到了既迅速地解放了绝大部分革命干部，又不草率从事。
    发动群众　狠抓帮字
    怎样帮助被解放的干部做出比较深刻的检查，使他们得到群众的谅解和信任，是解决好干部问题的关键。为此，大联委的同志采取各种形式，紧紧依靠群众，始终狠抓“帮”字。
    第一步，先组织小型帮助会，由有关干部和群众参加，对被解放干部的初步检查提出意见，帮助他提高认识，然后再在群众大会上检查。根据检查和群众提出的意见，再进行重点帮助。为彻底解决干部和群众之间的隔阂，使干部正确对待自己，正确对待群众，他们还让这些主要干部到基层去和群众一起学习，一起讨论，一起活动。哪个基层单位的群众对这个干部意见多，就先到哪里去，然后轮流到所有的基层单位，和群众见面谈心。群众反映说，这个办法好，符合毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导。干部也说“尝到了甜头”。
    不能“坐等”　要挑重担
    在实现革命三结合前夕，已经解放的主要干部中又普遍出现了“坐等”的思想：“你来结合就干，不来结合就算。”他们不愿意主动地站出来抓革命促生产。大联委的同志分析了这些干部只求解放，不求结合的活思想后，又采取各种方法，帮助他们真正从思想上站起来。首先组织这些干部大学毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑。毛主席关于“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”的教导，张思德、白求恩一心为革命、一切为革命，老愚公不怕一切困难、排除一切困难的光辉形象，给了他们极大的教育。同时，还组织这些干部大忆党对他们多年的培养和教育，大讲革命群众对他们的帮助和希望，给了他们绝大的勇气。有的干部说：“革命群众帮助我们站出来，是要我们挑起革命重担，而我们却想站在一边袖手旁观，太对不起毛主席了！”他们纷纷表示要和革命群众一起，永远跟着毛主席革命到底。
