Our southern military and people have fought very well! The American aggressors and their lackeys have suffered a thunderous blow. Our nation's war of resistance against the Americans to save the country is now in a new and very favorable situation. All our compatriots feel very excited and proud; our friends on the five continents are very happy! The closer we get to victory, the more difficulties we will face. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more fiercely. Therefore, our military and people must strengthen our unity, persist in the struggle, fight fiercely, and fight continuously to win greater victories.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6 — Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a telegram on February 4 to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, extending the warmest congratulations to the southern military and people for their brilliant victories since the New Year.

	The telegram said: In the first few days of the New Year, our southern military and people have fought very well, launching widespread and coordinated attacks; everywhere they fight, they achieve great victories! The American aggressors and their lackeys have suffered a thunderous blow and are in extreme panic and disarray; the puppet government and puppet army are collapsing in large numbers. All our compatriots feel very excited and proud; our friends on the five continents are very happy!

	The telegram said: The New Year's great victory in the South has put our nation's war of resistance against the Americans to save the country in a new and very favorable situation. Nothing can save the American aggressors and their lackeys from total collapse.

	The telegram pointed out: The closer we get to victory, the more difficulties we will face. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more fiercely. Therefore, our military and people must strengthen our unity, persist in the struggle, fight fiercely, and fight continuously to win greater victories.

	The telegram concluded: Justice is on our side. All our compatriots and soldiers are united as one, brave and intelligent, and will fight to the end and win. We will surely achieve a complete victory!
