	Space Force Study Group of Mao Zedong Thought Active Members' Revolutionary Criticism Articles Selected for Publication

	Editor's Note: Loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are the highest principles guiding all actions of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and are the greatest source of the army's combat effectiveness.

	Starting from the principle of "loyalty," one can be the bravest and most intelligent in any situation, always standing unyielding. Starting from the principle of "loyalty," one can dare to confront and eliminate the "selfish" thoughts in one's mind, wage an offensive battle, and climb the peak of "public interest," seeking neither fame nor wealth, fearing neither hardship nor death, wholeheartedly for the public and the revolution.

	Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our Party. For proletarian revolutionary fighters and Communist Party members, an important task at present is to thoroughly study and apply Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building theory, to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev, especially to use Chairman Mao's teaching of "selflessness" as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois individualism propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev to corrupt Party members.

	Here we publish articles by representatives of the Second Conference of Active Members Studying Chairman Mao's Works in the Space Force who criticize the revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev. They act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, establishing loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is precisely because of this that they have become proletarian revolutionary fighters who are wholeheartedly dedicated to the public.

	Prioritizing the Party and the Masses Over Oneself

	Model Soldier Wang Yuchang

	Chairman Mao teaches us: A Communist Party member should be "selfless" and "dedicate oneself entirely to the interests of others." However, the Chinese Khrushchev relentlessly peddles the reactionary philosophy of selfishness to Communist Party members. He shamelessly shouts: "Suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage," "Love and protect oneself for the sake of the Party and the revolution." Pfft! This is a great slander against our Communist Party members.

	The life of a Communist Party member belongs to the Party and the people. We should abandon any selfish thoughts, live for the revolution, and die for the revolution. Struggling loyally for the revolutionary cause is the greatest happiness for us Communist Party members. Although I now have only one hand, I will use that one hand to serve the people forever; although I now have only one leg, I will stride forward on the revolutionary path guided by Chairman Mao with that one leg. I will let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought guide every second of my life.

	For the revolution, for the people, there can be no pretense. Only by discarding the "self" and establishing the "public" can one fear no difficulties, no dangers, face death bravely, dare to stand firm even if the sky falls, and dare to venture into fire and water! In the past few years, I have made the decision to sacrifice myself five times to rescue endangered comrades. Especially during a live grenade throwing exercise in May 1965, a soldier's grenade misfired, and it was smoking and rolling into a shelter. At this critical moment, I immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: Communist Party members should "prioritize the Party and the masses over oneself, and prioritize others over oneself," "to die for the people is a worthy death." Chairman Mao's highest directive is a command. I must sacrifice myself to save my comrades. I must risk everything to rescue my class brother. I pounced towards the smoking grenade, picked it up, and just as I turned around, the grenade exploded! I was injured all over my body, becoming severely disabled. But I was happy that my comrade was safe, because I had done something beneficial for the Party and the people.

	What power enabled me to save my comrades at the cost of myself? It is the teachings of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches: "Our cadres should care for every soldier." I feel that caring for soldiers is caring for the revolution. The people entrust their children to the army, and we are the ones leading the soldiers. If we do not care for the soldiers and do not rescue them when they are in danger, we would be letting down the Party, the people, and our class brothers, and we would not be considered revolutionary cadres and Communist Party members. It is precisely by following Chairman Mao's teachings and having a deep class bond of sharing life and death with class brothers that I can be selfless and fearless, sacrificing myself to save others. If, as the Chinese Khrushchev says, one only thinks of "gaining big advantages" and "loving oneself," then at the moment when the grenade is about to explode, I would definitely not go to rescue my comrade, but would be too scared to move forward or would turn and run away. How despicable that would be! I firmly reject the tricks of the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Although my body has been severely injured, making it difficult for me to move and speak, my blood is boiling. As long as my heart beats for one second, I will be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao! I will join the soldiers in thoroughly criticizing the philosophy of selfishness of the Chinese Khrushchev, always and everywhere taking "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as my motto, forever preserving my revolutionary youth, and vowing to be a vanguard fighter of the proletariat who is forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and forever dedicated to serving the people.

    空军学习毛主席著作积极分子革命大批判文章选登
    编者按：忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这是人民解放军广大指战员一切行动的最高准则，是部队战斗力的最大源泉。
    从“忠”字出发，无论在任何情况下，都能最勇敢，最聪明，永远立于不败之地。从“忠”字出发，对自己头脑里的“私”字，就敢于刺刀见红，打进攻战，攀登上“公”字的高峰，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为公，一心为革命。
    毛泽东思想是我们党的灵魂。对于无产阶级革命战士、共产党员来说，当前的一项重要任务，是大学大用毛主席的无产阶级建党学说，大破中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线，特别是要用毛主席“大公无私”的教导为武器，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫用来腐蚀党员的资产阶级个人主义的谬论。
    这里发表的是空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会部分代表批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的文章。他们处处按照毛主席指示办事，树立了对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“忠”。正是因为这样，他们才成为一心为公的无产阶级革命战士。
    关心党和群众比关心自己为重
    爱兵模范　王裕昌
    毛主席教导我们：一个共产党员要“大公无私”，要“毫不利己专门利人”。而中国赫鲁晓夫拚命地向共产党员兜售反动的利己主义哲学。他无耻地叫喊：“吃小亏占大便宜”，“为了党和革命的利益而钟爱自己，保护自己”。呸！这是对我们共产党员的极大污蔑。
    共产党员的生命是属于党和人民的，我们应该抛弃任何私心杂念，为革命而生，为革命而死。忠诚地为革命事业而斗争，是我们共产党员最大的幸福。我现在虽然只有一只手，一只手也要永远为人民服务；我现在虽然只有一条腿，一条腿也要在毛主席指引的革命大道上阔步前进。我要让战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅我生命的每一秒钟。
    为革命，为人民，不能有一丝假。只有丢掉“我”字，树立“公”字，才能不怕困难，不怕危险，视死如归，天塌下来也敢顶，刀山火海也敢闯！在过去几年中，我曾五次下定牺牲自己的决心，去抢救遇险的战友。特别是一九六五年五月一次实弹投掷演习时，一位战士投弹失手，手榴弹嗤嗤地冒着烟，滚进了一个掩体。在这紧要关头，我立即想起毛主席的教导：共产党员要“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重”，“为人民而死，就是死得其所。”毛主席的最高指示就是命令，宁死我一人，不能让战友牺牲，豁出自己的一切，也要抢救阶级兄弟。我向这颗冒着烟的手榴弹猛扑过去，拿起它，刚转过身，手榴弹爆炸了！我全身受伤数十处，变成了严重的残废。但我为战友脱险而感到高兴，因为我为党和人民做了一点应该做的有益的事。
    什么力量使我能这样舍己救战友呢？是我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席的教导。毛主席教导说：“我们的干部要关心每一个战士”。我感到，关心战士，就是关心革命。人民把他们的子弟交给部队，我们是带兵的人，要是不关心战士，在他们遇险时不去救护他们，就对不起党，对不起人民，对不起阶级兄弟，就不能算一个革命干部和共产党员。我正是遵循了毛主席的教导，和阶级兄弟有着同生死共患难的深厚阶级感情，才能无私无畏，舍己救人。如果象中国赫鲁晓夫所说的那样，一心只想“占大便宜”、“钟爱自己”，那么在手榴弹即将爆炸的时刻，我一定不会上去抢救战友，只能被吓得一步不前，或转身逃跑。那是多么可鄙啊！我坚决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当。
    我尽管身体受到了严重的损伤，行动不方便，说话困难，可是，我浑身热血沸腾，只要心脏有一秒钟还在跳动，就要无限忠于毛主席！我要和战士们一起把中国赫鲁晓夫的利己主义哲学彻底批臭，时时、处处以“老三篇”为座右铭，永葆革命青春，誓做永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级先锋战士。
