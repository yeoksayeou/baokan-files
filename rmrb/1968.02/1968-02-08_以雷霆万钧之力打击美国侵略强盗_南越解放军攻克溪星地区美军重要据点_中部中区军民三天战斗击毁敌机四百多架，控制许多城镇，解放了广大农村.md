The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has stormed and captured an important American military stronghold in the Xa Xinh region. In three days of fierce battle, the military and civilian population of the Central Region have destroyed over 400 enemy aircraft, seized many towns, and liberated vast rural areas.

Hanoi, February 7 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam on February 7, the command of the People's Liberation Army in the Xa Xinh battlefield of Quang Tri Province issued a special communiqué on February 7 stating that at 2:30 AM on February 7, the People's Liberation Army stormed and captured the important American stronghold of Vinh Village and two nearby hills in the Xa Xinh region of Quang Tri Province, breaking through the American aggressors' defensive line on Highway 9.

The communiqué said: Vinh Village is an important stronghold of the American aggressors on Highway 9 and is a part of the enemy's "defense system" in the Xa Xinh region. It is about six kilometers southwest of the city of Cam Lo and about eight kilometers from the large base of the American Marine Corps at Da Nang. Nearly a thousand American and puppet troops are stationed in Vinh Village, and the defense is tight. It is of great significance for the defense of the Xa Xinh region and the Highway 9 defensive line, which is occupied by the American Marine Corps.

The communiqué said: At 00:15 on February 7, the artillery of the People's Liberation Army launched a fierce bombardment on Vinh Village. The infantry assault teams of the People's Liberation Army, divided into multiple routes, quickly rushed into the enemy stronghold, dividing the enemy into many small groups and annihilating them one by one. The enemy defending Vinh Village could not withstand the fierce offensive of the People's Liberation Army.

The communiqué said: At 2:30 AM, the People's Liberation Army completely captured Vinh Village and two hills about two kilometers to the south. The enemy's corpses were scattered all over the place, and the People's Liberation Army controlled the entire battlefield, capturing many enemy soldiers and seizing all their weapons.

The communiqué said: The capture of Vinh Village by the People's Liberation Army is a heavy blow to the American aggressors. This shows the immense power of the main force of the People's Liberation Army. This victory is greatly inspiring the entire military and civilian population of South Vietnam.

The communiqué finally called on all units of the Liberation Army in the Xa Xinh battlefield, all cadres, and soldiers to press forward, overcome all difficulties, and deal a thunderous blow to the American aggressors, achieve greater victories, and contribute to the complete victory of the sacred cause of resisting America and saving the nation.

Hanoi, February 6 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the Central Region issued a communiqué on February 3 stating that in recent three days of continuous battles, the People's Liberation Armed Forces, with the assistance of patriotic officers and soldiers in the people and the puppet army, have achieved tremendous victories.

The communiqué said: During this period, the People's Liberation Armed Forces simultaneously launched fierce attacks on the cities of Da Nang, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, Hoi An, Tam Ky, Quang Ngai, Tuy Hoa, Kontum, Pleiku, and Ban Me Thuot, as well as more than twenty towns and county seats, seizing many towns and liberating vast rural areas in the plains and mountains.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces attacked the enemy's twelve airports in Da Nang, No Man, Jule, Quang Ngai, Phu Cat, Qui Nhon, Tuy Hoa, Nha Trang, Cam Ranh Bay, New Cape, Kontum, and Ban Me Thuot, destroying more than 400 aircraft. At the same time, they attacked and burned the Ba Mo warehouse of the American Marine Corps, the Lien Chau oil depot, the Jule warehouse of the Americal Division, and the supply bases of the enemy's military logistics for the entire Central Highlands region, such as the Son Linh and Le Mountain warehouses. They destroyed many artillery positions and parking lots, annihilated and disintegrated many battalions and companies of the American and puppet armies and the South Korean mercenary army, and disintegrated many puppet security forces and self-defense forces.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces captured and severely damaged the U.S. First Field Force Headquarters in Nha Trang, the puppet First Army Headquarters in Da Nang, the puppet Second Army Headquarters in Pleiku, the puppet Second Division and Twenty-third Division Headquarters, the headquarters of four puppet army regiments, and the puppet military and political institutions of nine provinces in the Central Region, annihilating a large number of puppet government personnel and causing many county and township puppet governments to collapse.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces also destroyed the enemy's entire road transportation system, completely cutting off the strategic highways 1, 19, 14, and 21, causing the enemy's transportation to be paralyzed.

The communiqué pointed out that the People's Liberation Armed Forces have grown rapidly in the battle, while the enemy is extremely panicked and passive, being beaten everywhere. The enemy's military and political institutions at all levels in the provinces and counties have been paralyzed. The morale of the American and puppet armies and the mercenary army has plummeted. Many puppet officers and soldiers have announced their withdrawal from the puppet government and turned their guns on the American aggressors and the lackeys.

The communiqué finally said: The revolutionary high tide of resisting America and saving the nation is surging like a storm. Our military and civilian population are in a position of overwhelming superiority over the enemy. However, the enemy is making desperate struggles and frantically counterattacking. We still have to go through a difficult, fierce, and continuous offensive battle process, smash all the enemy's desperate resistance plots, and achieve complete victory.

    公报说：卫村是美国侵略军在第九号公路上的一个重要据点，是敌人在溪星地区“防御系统”的一个组成部分，离香化县城西南偏西约六公里，离达根美国海军陆战队的大型基地约八公里。卫村据点驻有近一千名美伪军，防守严密，对美国海军陆战队盘踞的溪星地区和第九号公路防线的防守具有重大的意义。
    公报说：二月七日零时十五分，解放军炮兵部队猛烈炮击卫村据点。解放军步兵突击队分成多路，迅速直插敌军据点，把敌人分割成许多小块，一部分一部分地歼灭。防守卫村据点的敌人在解放军勇猛的攻势下无法招架。
    公报说：凌晨二时三十分，解放军完全攻克卫村据点及其南面两公里的两个高地。敌人弃尸遍野，解放军控制了整个战场，俘获许多敌人，缴获全部武器。
    公报说：解放军攻克卫村据点是对美国强盗的一个非常沉重打击。这表明解放军主力部队具有无比巨大的威力。这一胜利正在大大地鼓舞着越南南方全体军民。
    公报最后号召溪星战场解放军各单位全体干部和战士乘胜前进，克服一切艰难困苦，给美国强盗以雷霆般的打击，建立更加巨大的战功，为抗美救国神圣事业的彻底胜利献出力量。
    据新华社河内六日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方中部中区人民解放武装力量指挥部三日发表的一项公报说，中部中区人民解放武装力量在人民和伪军中爱国官兵的协助下，最近经过三天连续的战斗，取得了极其巨大的胜利。
    公报说：人民解放武装力量在这期间同时向岘港、归仁、芽庄、会安、三岐、广义、绥和、昆嵩、波来古、邦美蜀等十个城市和二十多个市镇、县城发动猛烈进攻，控制了许多城镇，并解放了平原和山区的广大农村地区。
    人民解放武装力量袭击了敌人在岘港、诺曼、朱莱、广义、第德、归仁、绥和、芽庄、金兰湾、新景、昆嵩和邦美蜀等地的 十二个机场，击毁飞机四百多架，同时袭击和烧毁保莫美国海军陆战队总仓库、联昭油库、亚美利加师的朱莱仓库、为全部西原地区美伪军提供军需的逊岭、勒山仓库等敌军的后勤供应基地，击毁许多炮兵阵地和停车场，消灭和瓦解美伪军和南朝鲜帮凶军的许多营和连，瓦解许多伪保安队和民卫队。
    人民解放武装力量攻克和重创芽庄美国第一野战指挥部，岘港伪第一军指挥部，波来古伪第二军指挥部，伪第二师和第二十三师指挥部，伪军四个团的指挥部以及中部中区九个省的伪军事小区机构和伪省政权机构，歼灭大批伪政权人员，并使许多县、乡伪政权陷于瓦解。
    人民解放武装力量还破坏了敌人的整个公路交通系统，全部切断第一号、第十九号、第十四号和第二十一号战略公路，使敌人的交通运输陷于瘫痪。
    公报指出，人民解放武装力量在战斗中迅速成长，与此相反，敌人无比惊慌失措，到处被动挨打。省、县的敌人各级军事和政治机构都陷入瘫痪。美伪军和帮凶军的士气严重低落。许多伪军官兵已经宣布脱离伪政权，并掉转枪口向美国强盗和恶棍走狗开火。
    公报最后说：抗美救国革命高潮正在象暴风骤雨一样地掀起，我们军民正处于压倒敌人的优势。但是，敌人正在作垂死挣扎，疯狂进行反扑。我们还要经过一个艰巨、激烈和连续进攻的战斗过程，粉碎敌人的一切绝望反抗的阴谋，直到取得彻底胜利。
