The editorial is titled, "Advance in Victory, Overwhelm the Enemy with a Crushing Momentum, and Continuously Seize the Greatest Victories."

	The editorial states: In the past two days, victory reports have been pouring in from various parts of the South, like blooming flowers in spring. In just two days, more than forty towns have been simultaneously and fiercely attacked by the heroic liberation army and the people. Thousands of enemy-occupied villages have been controlled by the revolutionary people. The liberation army and revolutionary people have also occupied or destroyed almost all the radio stations in various places, attacked and destroyed many enemy airfields, bases, warehouses, military ports, and headquarters, and even the lairs of the American aggressors and their puppet clique have been fiercely attacked. A large number of American, puppet, and mercenary troops have been annihilated and disintegrated.

	The editorial points out: The spring offensive victory of the South Vietnamese people has vividly proven that the initiative on the South Vietnamese battlefield is completely in the hands of the South Vietnamese people, that the revolutionary heroism of the Vietnamese people is invincible, and that the people's war under the brilliant leadership of the National Liberation Front is invincible.

	The editorial states: Our military and people are determined to advance in victory, overwhelm the enemy with a crushing momentum, sweep away all obstacles, and bravely sacrifice to decisively seize the greatest victories.

	The editorial warmly praises the heroic soldiers of the South Vietnamese liberation army for their continuous and fierce charges in this all-out offensive, fighting tenaciously, continuously, and fiercely striking the American, puppet, and mercenary troops, annihilating many of the enemy's fighting forces, and standing out for the country together with the people. The editorial also warmly praises the patriotic people and various patriotic forces in the rural and urban areas of the South for actively supporting and closely cooperating with the people's liberation armed forces to annihilate the scoundrels, destroy the enemy's shackles of rule, continuously attack enemy airfields, bases, strongholds, cut off enemy supply lines, bravely fight the enemy, and make great contributions to the cause of national liberation.

	The editorial concludes: All the South Vietnamese military and people, united as one, will give the American aggressors and their puppets a thunderous blow, achieve even greater victories, and thoroughly smash American imperialist aggression. Although our struggle for self-liberation will still face many difficulties, we have already stood up. We will resolutely fight to the end and decisively seize the final victory.

This is the great power of the revolution, the great power of people's war, and the great power of the unity of the entire people fighting against American aggression and for national salvation according to the political program of the National Liberation Front.

	The editorial states: In recent days, in the areas temporarily controlled by the enemy, especially in various cities, people from all walks of life have risen up to fight, dealing a thunderous blow to the American aggressors and their puppets. These struggles have proven that any reactionary violence, even with a force of hundreds of thousands of troops, cannot stop the will of the entire nation to seek independence and freedom. This struggle is the strongest, most intense, and most widespread struggle. The people of various cities in the South, through this struggle, are determined to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and traitors together with the military and people of the entire country.

	The editorial states: American imperialism and its puppets are already in a state of panic. However, a dying beast is still ferocious. American imperialism and its puppets are plotting to slide deeper along the criminal path of adventure. However, no evil plot or means can save their complete failure. The developing situation is very favorable to the South Vietnamese military and people. The patriotic and revolutionary forces in various cities of the South will certainly advance in victory, continuously attack, and continuously seize victories.

The editorial states: The people of South Vietnam are bravely advancing to attack the enemy. The enemy is in a very embarrassing, passive, and desperate situation.

	The editorial states: The American aggressors and their puppets are making desperate struggles. However, no matter how crazy the enemy is, it cannot stop the victory of the South Vietnamese people. All the military and people of Vietnam are advancing in victory, launching continuous attacks on the enemy, resolutely not giving them a chance to breathe, and resolutely drowning them in the mire of complete failure, and then seizing complete victory.
