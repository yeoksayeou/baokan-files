Japanese farmers in Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka held a rally of 500 people on January 31 to continue their opposition to the reactionary Sato government's seizure of farmers' land for the construction of an airport for U.S. forces invading Vietnam. This marked the first battle cry of Sanrizuka farmers in 1968.

Before the rally began, the farmers, wearing badges of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, marched into the venue with high spirits. The front of the venue was adorned with slogans calling for the unity of farmers, workers, and students nationwide to overthrow the Sato cabinet, smash the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and oppose U.S. aggression in Vietnam. The entire venue was filled with a fighting atmosphere. The rally showed that after eliminating the interference of the revisionist group led by Nihon Kyosan-to's (Japanese Communist Party) Miyamoto at the end of last year, the Sanrizuka farmers are pushing their anti-American struggle to new heights.

The rally adopted a declaration, emphasizing that the Sanrizuka farmers must further unite with workers and students to continue the struggle and thoroughly smash the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to build an airport in Chiba Prefecture.

    据新华社一日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本千叶县三里塚农民五百人一月三十一日举行大会，继续反对佐藤反动政府夺取农民土地，为侵越美军修建机场的罪恶行径，打响了三里塚农民一九六八年斗争的第一炮。
    在大会开始前，农民们胸前佩戴着世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的像章，斗志昂扬地走进会场。会场正面悬挂着号召全国农民、工人和学生团结起来打倒佐藤内阁、粉碎日美“安全条约”、反对美帝侵略越南等标语，整个会场充满着战斗气氛。大会表明，三里塚农民在去年底排除了日共宫本修正主义集团的干扰后，正在把反美斗争推向新的高潮。
    大会通过一项宣言，强调三里塚农民要进一步同工人、学生团结起来，把斗争坚持下去，彻底粉碎美日反动派在千叶县修建机场的阴谋。
