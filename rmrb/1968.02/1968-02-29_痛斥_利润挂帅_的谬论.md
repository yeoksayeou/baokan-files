The Chinese Khrushchev has been promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in factories and enterprises. He madly advocates for "profit as the top priority," claiming that "a factory must make money. If it does not remit profits to the state, it should be shut down and salaries should be stopped."

Recently, workers from the supply, finance, garment, and knitting departments of the Beijing Knitting General Factory held a meeting. Using the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao as their weapon, and based on numerous facts, they criticized the fallacy of "profit as the top priority" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev.

At the beginning of the meeting, some comrades angrily pointed out that the essence of "profit as the top priority" is to undermine the socialist economic foundation and restore capitalism.

Comrade Xu Jinxian, a member of the factory revolutionary committee, said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that factories should prioritize politics. The Chinese Khrushchev and a small clique of capitalist roaders within our factory, however, want us to pursue 'profit as the top priority.' This is an attempt to drag our factory back to the old capitalist path, which we cannot allow."

Jia Shukui and Li Ruixiang said, "The Chinese Khrushchev claims that factories are for 'making money,' and if they do not remit profits, they should 'be shut down and salaries should be stopped.' This is a naked advocacy for capitalism. The purpose of our socialist factories and enterprises is to serve the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and to meet the needs of the people."

Participants in the meeting cited numerous facts to expose and criticize the crimes of the small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory who promoted the Chinese Khrushchev's "profit as the top priority."

Li Ruixiang, Lü Wenmin, and Sha Xiuzhen said, "Promoting 'profit as the top priority' inevitably harms national interests and disrupts the socialist planned economy. During the three years of temporary difficulties, the small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory only cared about making money for their own factory, using any means necessary. They illegally purchased over a thousand pieces of cotton yarn outside of the state's planned supply, which remained in the factory for a long time. Some of these were only sold at a reduced price three years later. Once, the factory was tasked with producing a batch of products for the military. When the factory had fewer tasks and could make a profit, the small clique of capitalist roaders ordered the supply personnel to actively seek this task. However, when there were other products with higher profits, they immediately ordered the supply personnel to cancel this military production task, seriously affecting military production. They also often instructed the finance department to set lower annual profit targets for the factory, so as to remit less profit to the state and gain more bonus from excess profits. They also falsified accounts and deceived the state in their financial planning work. This is purely a capitalist trick."

Hou Fengzhu, Xu Fāngshān, Cui Jinkuān, and Zhao Shuching said, "Promoting 'profit as the top priority' inevitably harms the interests of the working people and leads to capitalism. In the past, the small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory, in order to make more money, disregarded political influence and consumer interests, and stipulated the use of less material. Some products could not be worn after washing and could not be sold in the market, causing commercial departments and factories to accumulate large quantities, causing losses to consumers and the state. In terms of production direction, products that the masses welcome, they produce less because the profit is low; products that the masses do not welcome, they produce more because the profit is high. This completely violates Chairman Mao's principle of 'developing the economy and ensuring supply' and goes against Chairman Mao's teaching of 'serving the people wholeheartedly.'"

Participants in the meeting also pointed out that promoting "profit as the top priority" inevitably involves a big push for "material incentives" and "bonus as the top priority" among the worker masses, corrupting the revolutionary will of the workers.

Participants in the meeting enthusiastically discussed the new situation after the Cultural Revolution.

Old workers Liu Dequan, Wang Zhenshan, and Jia Shukui said, "Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and with the help of comrades from the 8341 Unit, we have overthrown the small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory and established a revolutionary committee. Now, all revolutionary workers in the factory are studying Chairman Mao's works and singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. We stand tall and see far, dedicating ourselves to the revolution and the people. We work with a happy heart. Everyone cares for and helps each other, working together to improve production. The entire factory is full of vigor and vitality. Let the Chinese Khrushchev's 'profit as the top priority' go to hell."

### 痛斥“利润挂帅”的谬论

    痛斥“利润挂帅”的谬论
    中国赫鲁晓夫在工厂企业中推行了一条反革命修正主义路线。他疯狂鼓吹“利润挂帅”，胡说什么：“一个工厂一定要赚钱，不给国家上缴利润，那就应该关门，应该停发工资。”
    最近，北京针织总厂供销科、财务科、成衣车间和针织车间的一些革命职工，召开了座谈会，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，根据大量事实，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“利润挂帅”的谬论。
    座谈会一开始，一些同志愤慨地指出“利润挂帅”的实质，是瓦解社会主义经济基础，复辟资本主义。
    工厂革命委员会委员许锦仙认为，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，办工厂要政治挂帅，中国赫鲁晓夫及我厂党内一小撮走资派，却要我们搞“利润挂帅”，这是要把我们工厂拉回到资本主义老路。这是绝不能容许的。
    贾树楷和李瑞祥认为，中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么办工厂是为了“赚钱”，不上缴利润，就“应该关门，应该停发工资”，这是赤裸裸地鼓吹资本主义。我们社会主义工厂企业生产的目的，是为了中国革命和世界革命，为了满足人民的需要。
    参加座谈会的同志，列举大量事实，揭发和批判工厂党内一小撮走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫“利润挂帅”的罪行。
    李瑞祥、吕文敏和沙秀贞认为，推行“利润挂帅”，必然损害国家利益，破坏社会主义计划经济。在三年暂时困难时期，工厂党内一小撮走资派只顾本厂“赚钱”，不择手段，套购进来国家计划供应以外的一千多件棉纱，长期积压在厂里。其中一部分在三年以后才降价处理掉。一次，厂里给军工部门加工一批产品，当厂里任务少，有利可图时，工厂党内一小撮走资派就命令供销人员积极争取，但是，后来又有了另外的利润高的产品，他们就马上命令供销人员去退掉这批军工产品，严重影响了军需生产。他们还经常要财务科同志，把工厂全年的利润指标订低一些，以便少向国家上缴利润，多得超额利润提成。他们还在财务计划工作上，弄虚作假，欺骗国家。这完全是资本家的一套手法。
    侯凤翥、徐芳山、崔金宽和赵淑清认为，推行“利润挂帅”，必然不惜损害劳动人民的利益，走上资本主义道路。过去，工厂党内一小撮走资派为了多赚钱，就不顾政治影响和消费者的利益，规定少用料。有的产品，下水后就不能穿，市场上卖不出去，商业部门和工厂大量积压，使消费者和国家都受到损失。在生产方向上，群众欢迎的产品，他们嫌利润低，下令少生产；群众不欢迎的产品，由于利润高，他们硬要多生产。这些，完全违反了毛主席的“发展经济，保障供给”的原则，违背了毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导。
    参加座谈会的同志还指出，推行“利润挂帅”，必然要在工人群众中大搞“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”，腐蚀工人的革命意志。
    参加座谈会的同志，以十分兴奋的心情，畅谈了文化大革命以后的新气象。
    刘德全、王振山和贾树楷等老工人认为，我们在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在八三四一部队同志的帮助下，打倒了工厂党内一小撮走资派，建立了革命委员会。现在全厂革命职工大学毛主席著作，大唱毛主席语录歌。我们站得高，看得远，一心为革命，一心为人民，劳动起来心情非常愉快。大家都互相关心，互相帮助，共同搞好生产，全厂朝气蓬勃，热气腾腾。让中国赫鲁晓夫的“利润挂帅”见鬼去吧。
