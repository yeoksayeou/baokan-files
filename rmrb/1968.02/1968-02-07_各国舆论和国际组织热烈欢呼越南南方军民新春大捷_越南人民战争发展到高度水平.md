International opinion and organizations have warmly celebrated the spring victory of the Vietnamese people in the South. They pointed out that the brilliant victory of the Vietnamese people in the South in their anti-American national salvation war has greatly boosted the morale of the world's revolutionary people and has greatly dampened the arrogance of American imperialism. This victory proves that the Vietnamese people's war has reached a high level, demonstrating to the people of the world the great power of people's war and fully proving that American imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

The Albanian newspaper "Warrior" published an article stating:

	Vietnamese People's Victory Inspires the World's People

The Albanian newspaper "Warrior" on the 4th published an editorial titled "The U.S. Aggressors Will Surely Be Defeated, the Vietnamese People's People's War Will Surely Be Victorious," which pointed out that the great offensive launched by the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam is the best and loudest response of the Vietnamese people to the American imperialists and their faithful lackeys, the Soviet revisionists.

The article pointed out that the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam have achieved one victory after another, showing that their offensive power has reached a new height.

"The Warrior" pointed out that the victory of the Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation war is also a victory for all the people of the world who love freedom. It inspires the liberation struggles of all the people of the world who love freedom.

The statement of the Permanent Bureau of the Afro-Asian Writers' Association pointed out:

	The Victory of the People of South Vietnam Greatly Dampens the Arrogance of American Imperialism

The Permanent Bureau of the Afro-Asian Writers' Association issued a statement on the 4th pointing out that the victory of the people of South Vietnam this time has greatly boosted the morale of the people of Asia and Africa, the people of other regions of the world, especially those engaged in people's armed struggles, and has greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism led by the United States, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys and accomplices. The statement said that all the modern weapons of American imperialism and the more than one million U.S. puppet troops in South Vietnam cannot save their doomed failure. The heroic armed forces of the people of South Vietnam have already proven that imperialism led by the United States is nothing but a paper tiger.

The statement said that the brilliant victory of the people of South Vietnam once again proves that "regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

The statement of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association said:

	The People of South Vietnam Have Given the U.S. Imperialists a Heavy Blow

The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association issued a statement on the 3rd pointing out that the brilliant victory of the people of South Vietnam has given the U.S. imperialists a heavy blow and severe punishment. It is also a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionists who are colluding with the U.S. to peddle the "peace talks" fraud.

The statement said that Chairman Mao Zedong recently said to the Vietnamese people:

	"You have fought well! Under extremely difficult conditions, relying on your own strength, you have beaten the most ferocious American imperialism into a state of desperation and disgrace, which is a great victory."

The statement said that the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war has greatly inspired the revolutionary people of the world, especially the revolutionary people of Asia and Africa. It has shown to the world the boundless power of people's war. Now the Vietnamese people have completely and firmly grasped the initiative of the war, proving that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's prospect for 1968 is completely correct. He said: "This year, the U.S. aggressors will be more passive and more disgraced. Our military and people will advance in victory and will surely achieve more great victories."

Pakistani public opinion said:

	The Days of the Americans in South Vietnam Are Numbered

The Chairman of the National People's Party of Karachi, Pakistan, Zainuddin Khan, issued a statement to the press on the 4th saying: The great victory of the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam has clearly proven the wise judgment of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. He pointed out: "The great victory of the people of South Vietnam is also a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought." Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are the most reliable and steadfast supporters of all freedom fighters in the world.

A recent issue of the Karachi "Sunday Mail" published an article titled "The Shameful End of American Imperialism in Vietnam Is Not Far Away," which said that the victory of the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam shows that the days of the Americans in South Vietnam are numbered.

Demonstrations in West Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway

	Yankee Go Home!
