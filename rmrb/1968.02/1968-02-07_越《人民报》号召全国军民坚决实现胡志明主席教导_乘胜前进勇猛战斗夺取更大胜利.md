The People's Army of Vietnam calls on the entire military and civilian population to resolutely implement Chairman Ho Chi Minh's instructions, to advance victoriously, and to fight bravely to achieve even greater victories.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6 — On February 6, the Vietnam People's Army published an editorial in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, congratulating the military and civilian population of South Vietnam on their New Year victories. The editorial calls on the entire military and civilian population of Vietnam to resolutely carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's instructions, to advance victoriously, and to achieve even greater victories.

The editorial states that Chairman Ho's congratulations to the southern military and civilian population are a commendation from the homeland to the heroic south.

The editorial states that the southern military and civilian population, undaunted by hardships, are advancing with a momentum that overwhelms the enemy. The enemy is using aircraft to bomb urban residents and releasing tear gas against residents in a desperate struggle. However, bombs and tear gas will absolutely not save the enemy from its inevitable defeat.

The editorial concludes by saying, "The closer we get to victory, the more difficulties we will encounter. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle even more desperately. Therefore, our military and civilian population must strengthen our unity, persist in our struggle, fight fiercely, and fight continuously to achieve even greater victories." Chairman Ho's words are a source of strength and a battle command. Our entire people will resolutely implement the instructions of our great national leader, Chairman Ho, advance victoriously, and achieve even greater victories.

    越《人民报》号召全国军民坚决实现胡志明主席教导
    乘胜前进勇猛战斗夺取更大胜利
    新华社河内六日电　越南《人民报》六日就胡志明主席致电阮友寿主席祝贺南越军民新春大捷发表社论，号召越南全国军民坚决贯彻胡志明主席的教导，乘胜前进，夺取更大胜利。
    社论说，胡主席对南方军民的祝贺，就是祖国对英雄南方的表彰。
    社论说，南方军民不怕艰难困苦，正以压倒敌人的气势前进。敌人使用飞机轰炸城市居民和对居民施放催泪气体，进行绝望的挣扎。但是，炸弹和催泪气体绝对挽救不了敌人彻底失败的命运。
    社论最后说，胡主席说：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。因此，我们军民更要加强团结，坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利。”胡主席的话是力量，是战斗命令。我们全国人民坚决实现我们民族的伟大领袖胡主席的教导，乘胜前进，夺取更大的胜利。
