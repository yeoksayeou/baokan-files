	Editor's Note: For the people, for the revolution, the more difficult the task, the more we must strive; the more challenges we face, the more we must overcome; the more perilous the path, the more we must forge ahead; the more treacherous the terrain, the more we must climb. This is the spirit of the proletarian revolutionary warriors. The broad masses of soldiers and revolutionary workers of the General Logistics Department of the PLA are fighting on the icy mountains, on the frontier grasslands, and in the north and south of the seas.

	Where does the strength to fight and struggle come from? The answer is only one: from studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, from breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public."

	Break down the bourgeois worldview advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, establish the proletarian worldview taught by the great leader Chairman Mao, break down the fortress of "self," and build the Great Wall of "public." In this way, a generation of proletarian revolutionary warriors grows rapidly under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. They do not seek fame, do not seek personal gain, are not afraid of hardship, and are not afraid of death. They dedicate themselves to the public cause, revolutionize thoroughly, and revolutionize forever. They truly achieve the goal of "having the red sun in their hearts, fearing neither wind nor snow, trampling great difficulties underfoot, and daring to climb even in the face of mountain collapse and earth-shaking disasters."

	Published here are some articles from representatives of the Second Session of the Study Chairman Mao's Works Active Participants Conference of the General Logistics Department, who have broken down the bourgeois worldview of the Chinese Khrushchev and established the proletarian worldview. They have extensively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and their spirit of hard struggle is worth serious learning.

	Willingly Endure Hardships for Communism
	Wáng Zhōngqīng, Political Commissar of a Certain Army Horse Farm

	For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has used the idea of fame and personal gain to corrupt people's souls. He advocates, "Make a firm decision to willingly endure some hardships... and resolve to do several decades of field work, and in the end, the people will understand and take care of you," "suffer first, reap benefits later." Look, enduring hardship is for personal gain, climbing up, the wolf's ambition is truly revealed!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and is thoroughly working for the people's interests." Revolutionaries should have the spirit of thorough revolution, eternal revolution, hard struggle, not seeking fame, not seeking personal gain. During the war years, I followed the great leader Chairman Mao in fighting for many years, and in my heart, I was determined to make the laboring people, who were suffering in deep water and fire, live a happy life. Today, I have become a leading cadre. Can I be content with the status quo, enjoy privileges, and let people "take care of me"? Absolutely not. In the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, can we maintain the spirit of hard struggle? Can we consciously live a hard life? This is a big issue of whether we can follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution. I am determined to strictly require myself: the environment has changed, but the resolve to follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution cannot change; the position is high, but the essence of an ordinary soldier cannot change; the life is good, but the spirit of hard struggle cannot be discarded! In the autumn of 1965, the Party decided that I should go to the horse farm. The work at the horse farm is hard, but I thought: wherever Chairman Mao points, we will fight there! My heart should be on the cause of communism, and my strength should be on the cause of communism. To endure some hardship for the cause of communism is the greatest happiness and the greatest glory. Thus, I carried the four volumes of the treasure book and resolutely set foot on the new battlefield.

	At the horse farm, I and the herdsmen together set a great ambition: "With feet on the grassland and head touching the sky, the frontier is our home and the horses are our companions," "Turn the heart into ice and snow, drive away the cold with hot blood, love the horses as our children, and take root in the grassland!" I have a stomach disease, but I am alert not to seek special treatment. Taking Comrade Jiaozhu Lu as an example, I am determined to struggle hard for the cause of communism. To change the face of the horse farm and solve the problem of self-sufficiency in fine grains, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "self-reliance" and launched a battle against the barren mountains and demanded grain from the earth. We turned eight hundred mu of rocky and barren fields into "Dazhai fields." When people and horses lacked water, we laid a 150-li pipeline to bring water up the mountain. The farm area was desolate, so we worked day and night and planted 680,000 trees. Now, the sleeping grassland presents a prosperous scene of abundant water and grass, lush trees, and people and horses rejoicing.

	I feel that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have a blueprint of communism in their hearts, stand high, and see far. No matter how hard the work is, it is sweet in the heart! The Chinese Khrushchev wants to use the rope of personal fame and gain to lead us down the road of revisionism, but it won't work! Enduring hardship for personal fame and gain is as light as a feather; enduring hardship for the cause of communism is as heavy as Mount Tai! We will definitely take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, maintain the red revolutionary integrity, and endure hardship for the cause of communism for a lifetime.

### 甘心为共产主义吃苦

    编者按：为人民，为革命，越是艰苦越要干，越是困难越要闯，越是火海越要冲，越是刀山越要上。这是无产阶级革命战士的豪情壮志。解放军总后勤部的广大指战员和革命职工，就是以这样的豪情壮志，战斗在冰山雪岭，战斗在边疆草原，战斗在海北天南。
    如此艰苦奋斗的力量从哪里来？答案只有一个：从活学活用毛泽东思想来，从大破“私”字大立“公”字来。
    大破中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的资产阶级世界观，大立伟大领袖毛主席教导的无产阶级世界观，大破“私”字的堡垒，大立“公”字的长城。这样，一代无产阶级革命战士就在毛泽东思想哺育下迅速成长。他们不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为公，彻底革命，永远革命，真正做到了“心中有了红太阳，风雪严寒都不怕，天大困难踩脚下，山崩地裂也敢上。”
    这里发表的是总后勤部第二届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会部分代表大破中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观的一组文章。他们大学大用毛主席著作，艰苦奋斗的精神，值得大家认真学习。
    甘心为共产主义吃苦
    某军马场政委　王忠卿
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫用名利思想来腐蚀人们的灵魂。他鼓吹“要下定决心，甘心自己去吃一些苦，……立志去干几十年野外工作，最后人民是会了解你们、照顾你们的”，“吃苦在前，得利在后。”看，吃苦是为了得私利，向上爬，狼子野心暴露得真是淋漓尽致！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我们革命者应该具有彻底革命、永远革命、艰苦奋斗、不为名、不为利的精神。在战争年代里，我跟着伟大领袖毛主席打了好多年仗，心坎里是为了使水深火热中的劳动人民能过上幸福日子。今天我成了领导干部，能安于现状，养尊处优，让人们来“照顾”吗？绝对不能。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，能不能保持艰苦奋斗的作风，能不能自觉地过艰苦生活，这是能不能跟着毛主席革命到底的大问题。我决心严格要求自己：环境变了，跟着毛主席革命到底的决心不能变；地位高了，普通一兵的本色不能改；生活好了，艰苦奋斗的作风不能丢！一九六五年秋天，党决定我到军马场。马场的工作是艰苦的，但我想：毛主席指到那就打到那！我的心要往共产主义事业上想，我的劲要往共产主义事业上使，为共产主义事业吃一点苦，是最大的幸福，最大的光荣。于是我怀揣四卷宝书，毅然踏上了新的战斗岗位。
    在马场，我和牧工一起立下了雄心壮志：“脚踏草原头顶天，边疆为家马作伴”，“丹心化冰雪，热血驱严寒，爱马如爱子，扎根在草滩！”我有胃病，自己警惕不搞特殊化，以毛主席的好学生焦裕禄为榜样，决心为共产主义事业艰苦奋斗。为了改变马场面貌，解决细粮不能自给的困难，我们按照毛主席“自力更生”的教导，向荒山开战，向大地要粮，把八百亩遍地是石头、山包的薄田，建成了“大寨田”。人马缺水，我们就铺设了一百五十华里管道引水上山。场区荒凉，我们就昼夜苦干，栽了六十八万株树木。现在，沉睡的草滩，呈现出了水草丰盛，绿树成林，人欢马腾的欣欣向荣景象。
    我感到，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，心里装着共产主义的蓝图，站得高，看得远，工作再苦心里甜！中国赫鲁晓夫妄想用名利主义这根绳索牵着我们的鼻子往修正主义道路上滑，办不到！为个人名利吃苦，轻如鸿毛；为共产主义事业吃苦，重如泰山！我们一定以毛主席的最新指示为纲，斗私批修，保持鲜红的革命晚节，为共产主义事业吃一辈子苦。
