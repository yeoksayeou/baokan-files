The People's Army Invincible in Battle – Warm Congratulations on the Seventh Anniversary of the Establishment of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the great victory of the Vietnamese people in the South during the Lunar New Year, the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam has arrived. It is this young people's armed force, born just seven years ago, that is now displaying its might on the battlefield in South Vietnam, defeating the number one imperialist aggressor, the United States, and achieving a great victory that has shocked the world. The Chinese people, with hearts full of excitement, extend the warmest congratulations to the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam on this glorious day, and express the highest respect to the Vietnamese people and the comrades of the People's Liberation Armed Forces who are bravely fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle!

The People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam were born in the flames of the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Over the past seven years, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and with the strong support of their compatriots in the North, they have held high the banner of national liberation, braved all hardships, and fought valiantly. They have grown from a small, poorly armed guerrilla force into a powerful armed force comprising main forces, local forces, and militias. This brave and skilled people's armed force is the reliable guarantee for the Vietnamese people's final victory in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam are a people's army fighting for the sacred cause of national liberation and national reunification, and are the sons and daughters of the people of South Vietnam. The broad masses of officers and soldiers in this army possess a high level of political awareness and a spirit of revolutionary heroism, determined to fight to the end and win. They are full of fighting spirit, indomitable, and daring, and on the battlefield, they can overcome all enemies and never be subdued by them. This army has a close bond with the people, and enjoys the broadest and most enthusiastic support from the people. This enables it to roam freely on the land of the motherland, fight flexibly with the enemy, and gain an inexhaustible source of strength for developing its own forces and overcoming all difficulties. Therefore, although the U.S. imperialists have spared no effort in recent years to try to annihilate the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, this people's army has become stronger and more formidable with each battle, fighting brilliant battles on the battlefield in South Vietnam and creating miracles in the history of national liberation wars.

Revolutionary people learn to swim by swimming and learn to fight by fighting. It is in the long struggle against the ferocious enemy, U.S. imperialism, that the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have mastered the laws of war and accumulated rich experience. They creatively apply the strategies and tactics of people's war, constantly annihilating large numbers of the enemy's combat forces, gradually changing the balance of power between the enemy and themselves on the battlefield in South Vietnam, firmly seizing the initiative, and making the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation a great cause.

The glorious history of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam over the past seven years has convincingly proven to the world that the revolutionary forces of the people, from weak to strong and from small to large, is an inevitable law of class struggle and an inevitable law of people's war. An army fighting for the interests of the people, no matter how small it is at the beginning and no matter how powerful the enemy it faces, as long as it adheres to the correct political and military lines and persists in a protracted people's war, it will surely grow rapidly and become strong in fierce battles and ultimately defeat the ferocious enemy.

Recently, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, together with the broad masses of the people, launched a new offensive during the Lunar New Year, achieving unprecedented glorious new victories and currently advancing in victory, expanding the fruits of victory. In this all-out offensive like a sudden storm, in addition to the broad masses in the liberated areas wholeheartedly supporting the People's Liberation Armed Forces in their fighting, the people of various strata in the enemy-occupied cities and countryside have risen up in arms, cooperating with the liberation army to kill the enemy and eliminate traitors, leveling enemy strongholds and destroying the puppet government. Because of the joint military and civilian operations and the coordination between cities and countryside, not only have the vast rural areas become a vast sea of people's war, but the cities occupied by the enemy have also become a vast sea of people's war. At the same time, a large number of patriotic officers and soldiers in the puppet army and many patriotic elements in the puppet government have rushed to abandon the darkness and join the ranks of the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, forming an internal and external encirclement of the enemy. In this way, the combination of military and civilian forces, cities and countryside, and internal and external forces has greatly demonstrated the invincible power of people's war, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, and opening up a new situation for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on them."

In the Lunar New Year offensive, the people of South Vietnam have developed people's war to a high level, which is the result of the broadest mobilization and organization of the people of all strata in South Vietnam, and also the result of the unprecedented strength of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam and their further grasp of the initiative in war. This signifies that the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is increasingly approaching final victory. The day when the U.S. aggressors are driven out of Vietnam is not far off!

The People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, since their establishment seven years ago, have already developed into an invincible people's army. In the future arduous struggle, they will be further tempered and become even stronger and more powerful. No matter how the U.S. imperialists continue to struggle desperately in the future, they will not be able to avert their complete failure. The Vietnamese people have made up their minds to drive out every last U.S. aggressor from their land. The 700 million people of China are the most reliable comrades of the Vietnamese people. We will always be loyal to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people to the end. We are firmly convinced that the 31 million heroic Vietnamese people, by strengthening their unity and fighting, will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation!

### 人民军队战无不胜——热烈祝贺越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年

    人民军队战无不胜
    ——热烈祝贺越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年
    在越南南方人民新春大捷的凯歌声中，越南南方人民解放武装力量统一日七周年纪念日到来了。正是这支诞生刚刚七个年头的年青的人民武装力量，今天在越南南方战场上大显神威，把当代头号帝国主义强盗美国侵略者打得落花流水，取得了震惊世界的伟大胜利。中国人民怀着无比兴奋的心情，最热烈地祝贺越南南方人民解放武装力量这个光辉的节日，并且向正在反美斗争最前线英勇战斗的越南南方人民和人民解放武装力量的战友们致以最崇高的敬意！
    越南南方人民解放武装力量，是在抗美救国斗争的烈火中诞生的。七年来，它在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，在北方同胞的大力支援下，高高举起民族解放的旗帜，披荆斩棘，浴血奋战，在战斗中不断成长，从人数不多、武器简陋的游击队发展成为一支包括主力部队、地方部队和民兵的强大的武装力量。这支骁勇善战的人民武装力量，是越南人民抗美救国战争取得最后胜利的可靠保证。
    越南南方人民解放武装力量，是一支为着民族解放和祖国统一的神圣事业而战的人民军队，是越南南方人民的子弟兵。这支军队的广大官兵，具有献身于人民利益的高度政治觉悟和决战决胜的革命英雄主义精神。他们斗志昂扬，顽强不屈，勇往直前，敢冲敢拚，在战场上能够压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。这支军队同人民群众有着血肉的联系，得到人民群众的最广泛、最热情的支持。这就使它能够在祖国的土地上纵横驰骋，行动自如地同敌人进行战斗，取得了发展自己队伍的不竭源泉和战胜各种困难的无穷力量。因此，尽管美帝国主义几年来竭尽全力妄想把越南南方人民解放武装力量消灭掉，可是这支人民军队却越战越勇，越战越强，在南越战场上打出一个又一个的漂亮仗，创造了世界民族解放战争史上的奇迹。
    革命的人民是在游泳中学会游泳，在战争中学会战争的。正是在同美帝国主义这个凶恶敌人长期较量的过程中，越南南方人民解放武装力量摸熟了战争的规律，积累了丰富的经验。他们创造性地运用人民战争的战略战术，不断歼灭敌人大量的有生力量，逐步改变了南越战场上敌我力量的对比，牢牢地掌握了战场上的主动权，使越南人民抗美救国战争出现了一派大好形势。
    英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量七年来的光辉历程，向全世界雄辩地证明：人民革命力量从弱到强，从小到大，是阶级斗争发展的必然规律，是人民战争发展的必然规律。一支为着人民利益而战的人民军队，不论它在开始时是多么弱小，不论它面临的敌人是多么强大，只要实行正确的政治路线和军事路线，坚持持久的人民战争，就一定能够在严酷的战斗中迅速壮大发展，而在最后战胜凶恶的敌人。
    最近，越南南方人民解放武装力量同广大人民群众一道向敌人发动的新春攻势，又取得了空前辉煌的新胜利，目前正在乘胜前进，扩大战果。在这次势如疾风暴雨的全面出击中，除了解放区广大群众万众一心、全力支援人民解放武装力量作战而外，敌占区城乡各阶层人民纷纷揭竿而起，配合解放军杀敌锄奸，夷平敌军据点，捣毁美伪政权。由于军民并肩作战，城乡配合行动，不仅使广大农村地区成为人民战争的汪洋大海，而且使敌人占领的城市也成为人民战争的汪洋大海。同时，伪军中的大批爱国官兵和伪政权中的不少爱国分子也争相弃暗投明，参加抗美救国斗争的行列，对敌人形成了内外夹攻的局面。这样军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合，极大地发挥了人民战争的无比威力，给美国侵略者及其走狗以极其沉重的打击，为越南人民的抗美救国战争打开了一个新局面。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    越南南方人民在新春出击中把人民战争发展到了一个高度水平，这是越南南方各阶层的人民群众最广泛地动员起来、组织起来的结果，也是越南南方人民解放武装力量空前强大和进一步掌握了战争主动权的结果。这标志着，越南人民抗美救国战争已经越来越接近最后胜利。美国侵略者被赶出越南的日子已经不远了！
    越南南方人民解放武装力量，在它诞生以来的七年中，已经发展成为一支不可战胜的人民军队。在今后艰苦的战斗历程中，它还将得到进一步的锻炼，而变得更加强大、更加有力量。美帝国主义不管今后怎样继续进行疯狂的挣扎，都无法挽救它的彻底失败。越南人民已下定决心把美国侵略者一个不剩地赶出自己的国土。七亿中国人民是越南人民最可靠的战友，我们永远忠于我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，坚决支持越南人民打到底。我们深信，三千一百万英雄的越南人民加强团结，加强战斗，一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利！
