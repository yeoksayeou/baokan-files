In the face of the overwhelming offensive launched by the people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam against U.S. and puppet forces and mercenary troops in recent days, news agencies and newspapers of the United States and other Western countries have admitted that the South Vietnamese military and civilians have achieved unprecedentedly brilliant victories, inflicting extremely heavy blows on U.S. imperialism. The U.S. ruling clique is stunned and worried.

In a report from Washington, a correspondent for Agence France-Presse pointed out that "Johnston, who has hardly slept since Monday, feels extremely tired." The Associated Press reported that the brilliant victories of the South Vietnamese military and civilians have made the decision-makers in Washington and the generals in the Pentagon very uneasy, far beyond what they have admitted.

In a report from Saigon on February 2, the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur stated that the people's liberation armed forces' offensive against U.S. troops has shattered most of the illusions supported by the statistics released by the United States last year. The developments over the past few days have proven that the United States "can no longer play the role of 'Asian policeman' today."

In their comments, Western news agencies marveled at the boundless power of the people's war in South Vietnam, which has left U.S. imperialism reeling. Agence France-Presse reported from Saigon that the South Vietnamese military and civilians' "sudden offensive is unprecedented in any previous situation in the Indochina wars." The report said, "No one expected the National Liberation Front command to use so many troops against so many important targets across the country." The British newspaper *The Times* quoted an American military policeman as saying, "They (referring to the people's liberation armed forces) are everywhere, in the fields, in the houses, wherever you are."

*The New York Times* lamented that many U.S. bases, barracks, and even the "U.S. Embassy" in South Vietnam were simultaneously attacked by the South Vietnamese military and civilians, which is "another painful evidence of the limitations of U.S. power in Asia." The French newspaper *Combat* pointed out that the U.S. military, deeply mired in the people's war, has seen its strategies and tactics in the South Vietnamese battlefield fail. The newspaper said: Despite having 500,000 U.S. troops in South Vietnam, the initiative in the war has firmly remained in the hands of the people's liberation armed forces.

### 美国、西方通讯社和报刊供认  南越军民全面出击沉重打击美帝

    美国、西方通讯社和报刊供认
    南越军民全面出击沉重打击美帝
    据新华社三日讯　在越南南方人民解放武装力量连日来以排山倒海之势对美、伪军和帮凶军发动的强大攻势面前，美国和西方其他国家的资产阶级通讯社和报刊承认，越南南方军民全面出击取得无比辉煌的胜利，美帝遭到极其沉重的打击，美国统治集团目瞪口呆，愁眉苦脸。
    法新社记者在发自华盛顿的报道中指出，“从星期一以来几乎没有睡过觉的”约翰逊“感到极其疲倦”。美新处的报道承认，南越军民的辉煌胜利，使华盛顿的“决策人和五角大楼的将军们十分不安，其不安程度远远超出他们所承认的”。
    西德的德意志新闻社二日自西贡发出的报道指出，人民解放武装力量向美国军队的全面出击，粉碎了美国去年发表的统计数字“所支持的大部分幻想”，过去几天事态发展证实，美国“今天再也无法扮演‘亚洲宪兵’的角色了”。
    西方通讯社在评论中惊叹越南南方的人民战争威力无穷，打得美帝国主义晕头转向。法新社在发自西贡的报道中说，越南南方军民“这次突然而来的攻势是几次印度支那战争中以前见到的任何情况无法相比的”，“没有一个人想到民族解放阵线指挥部能对分布全国如此多和如此重要的目标使用这么多兵力”。英国《泰晤士报》引述的一个美国宪兵的话说，“他们（指人民解放武装力量）到处都是，在田野里，在住宅里，不论你在什么地方。”
      《纽约时报》哀叹，美国在南越的许多基地、兵营，甚至美国“大使馆”同时遭到越南南方军民的袭击，是“表明美国在亚洲的力量有限的又一个令人痛苦的证据”。法国《战斗报》指出，美国军队由于深陷在人民战争的海洋中，美国在南越战场上所使用的战略战术已经破产。这家报纸说：尽管有五十万美国军队在南越，可是，作战的主动权却牢牢地掌握在人民解放武装力量的手里。
