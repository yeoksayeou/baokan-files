The revolutionary leading cadres of Xiyouying Production Brigade in Xiaozhan District, Tianjin, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army's 4704 Unit, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They fought against the "private" tendencies and fiercely criticized the "revisionist" ideas. Many long-standing problems were resolved this time. The poor and lower-middle peasants actively supported the revolutionary cadres in taking on heavy responsibilities. The revolutionary cadres decided to be good cadres of Chairman Mao and pioneers of revolutionization, and to achieve new victories in the spring plowing and production.

Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Actively Support Revolutionary Cadres in Taking on Heavy Responsibilities

Xiyouying Production Brigade was once a stronghold of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of China's Khrushchev, Zhou Yang, and the Tianjin City's anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of Wan Zhang. They attempted to implement "self-management, self-reliance, and free distribution" and "four freedoms" in this area as an "experimental field." The class struggle was extremely sharp and complex.

During the "Four Clean-ups" movement, the bad cadres who were exposed and removed by the poor and lower-middle peasants were not willing to accept their defeat. They colluded with local landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, as well as with the ghosts and snakes in society, to deceive some of the masses. They attempted to strike and frame the revolutionary leading cadres, engaging in frenzied counter-revolutionary activities. Some leading cadres were even removed from their positions and demoted. In this situation, the poor and lower-middle peasants watched and remembered. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class, class struggle, and cadre issues. They believed that the cadres of Xiyouying Production Brigade were mostly from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds and were all revolutionary. The poor and lower-middle peasants firmly supported them and enthusiastically helped them, thoroughly smashing the enemy's plots and tricks.

Last year, Brigade Party Secretary Wang Wanting and several team leaders were affected by a few big-character posters from the masses. Some lost their enthusiasm, while others harbored resentment. The poor and lower-middle peasants, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "mutual concern, mutual love, and mutual help," visited the cadres' homes, explained Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and enthusiastically helped and supported them. They also helped them recall their bitter past and sweet present, educating them not to fall behind and to take power for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many cadres, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, followed Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism. They actively visited the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, sought opinions, listened to criticisms, conducted deep self-examinations, and were welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The cadres who originally wanted to give up their responsibilities, through studying Chairman Mao's works and the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, deeply realized that doing a good job in this year's spring plowing and production was of great significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary cadres are a backbone force for "grasping revolution and promoting production." At critical moments, whether the cadres stand up to take on heavy responsibilities is a test of their loyalty to Chairman Mao. They expressed their determination to stand up for the revolution and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production. They vowed to achieve new victories in grasping revolution and promoting production.

Fight Against Selfishness and Be Good Cadres of Chairman Mao for Life

Chairman Mao said: "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." Although the leading cadres of this brigade have all stood up and taken on heavy responsibilities, they still have selfish thoughts and have not firmly established the idea of being good cadres for life for the revolution. Especially those who have made some mistakes in the past, during the Cultural Revolution, they were impacted and harbored resentment, harboring the thought of "changing shifts." Some thought that being a cadre was hard work, offending people, and being persecuted during the movement, thus developing the fear of being a cadre; others thought that being a cadre made it difficult for the masses to follow the leadership, thus developing the difficulty of being a cadre.

The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed here, targeting the cadres' active thoughts, helped them hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and teachings on cadre issues, and guided them to recall the bitterness of losing power a few years ago in Xiyouying and the sweetness of regaining power now. Using vivid class struggle examples, they deeply educated them. The soldiers also helped them recall the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society; recall the persecution of the capitalist reactionary line and speak of the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, arousing their class feelings. Many cadres, at the self-criticism and criticism meetings, examined their bourgeois thoughts, fought against resentment, criticized the theory of "being a cadre is a loss," overcame the fear, and replaced it with the courage to dare. They further established the thought of serving the people.

Deputy Secretary of the Brigade Party Committee, Zhang Yuming, previously had the thought of "changing shifts," but through study, his mind became clear. He decided to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, take power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, fight for the poor and lower-middle peasants, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be good cadres of Chairman Mao for life. Xu Zhongyi, the militia company commander who was framed as a "counter-revolutionary" and unjustly expelled from the party for seven years by China's Khrushchev's agent here, said: "Chairman Mao trusts us, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary leading cadres, the most. We will resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, be cadres for life for the revolution, use power well, take power well, and make the proletarian iron mountain last forever without changing color."

Revolutionary Leading Cadres Should Be Pioneers in Spring Plowing and Production

Chairman Mao said: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Through a year of the Cultural Revolution, the cadres of Xiyouying Production Brigade have significantly improved their ideological awareness. They think what the poor and lower-middle peasants think and worry about what the poor and lower-middle peasants worry about. They listen to Chairman Mao the most, believe in and rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants the most, and resolutely follow the socialist road. The seven members of the Party Committee and over fifty cadres above the team level can all lead in learning, working, and laboring. The Party Committee is united like one person, forming a strong fighting collective. Brigade Leader Sun Qingxi has a leg disease and walks with difficulty. The poor and lower-middle peasants advised him to rest, but he would not agree. During the day, he worked with the community members, and at night, he went to the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. He often helped the five-guarantee households with odd jobs. This year, as soon as spring arrived, the cadres led in studying Chairman Mao's works, accumulating and transporting fertilizer in production. The political atmosphere of the entire brigade has never been as thick as it is today, and the enthusiasm of the community members has never been as high as it is today. The poor and lower-middle peasants deeply appreciate the revolutionary cadres' every word and deed, feeling deeply moved.

"United hearts of cadres and masses, turning yellow soil into gold." The cadres of Xiyouying Production Brigade, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, look in the same direction, think with one heart, use one strength, and walk on the same path. They actively organize and lead the masses in this year's spring plowing and production, determined to ride the victorious momentum of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and to strive for a double harvest of revolution and production with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day."

    当毛主席的好干部　做革命化的带头人
    ——天津小站地区西右营大队干部斗私批修，决心在春耕生产中立新功
    天津小站地区西右营大队的革命领导干部，在人民解放军四七○四部队毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠斗了“私”字，猛批了“修”字，多年没解决的问题，这次都解决了。贫下中农积极支持革命干部挑重担，革命干部决心当毛主席的好干部，做革命化的带头人，在抓革命促春耕中，为人民立新功。
    贫下中农积极支持革命干部站出来挑重担
    西右营大队曾是中国赫鲁晓夫的亲信、反革命修正主义分子周扬，伙同这个地区走资派复辟资本主义的黑据点；天津市万张反革命修正主义集团，又插手在这里搞“三自一包”“四大自由”的“试验田”。阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂。
    在“四清”运动中被贫下中农揪下台的坏干部，不甘心他们的失败，便勾结地、富、反、坏分子和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，蒙蔽一些群众，妄想打击和陷害革命领导干部，猖狂地进行反革命活动，甚至把一些领导干部打下台，罢了官。在这种情况下，贫下中农看在眼里，记在心上。他们并反复学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争和干部问题的教导。他们认为，西右营大队的干部，大多数是贫下中农出身，都是革命的。贫下中农坚决支持他们，热情帮助他们，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。
    去年，大队党支部书记王万亭同志和几个生产队的队长，因为群众给他们贴了几张大字报就受不住了。有的干劲不足，有的产生了“怨”气。贫下中农就按照毛主席关于“互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，深入到干部家里，讲毛主席的干部政策，热情地帮助他们，坚决支持他们，并和他们一起忆苦思甜，教育他们不能掉队，要为贫下中农掌权。不少干部在贫下中农的帮助下，遵循毛主席关于批评和自我批评的教导，主动地深入到贫下中农家里，征求意见，听取批评，深刻检查，受到贫下中农的欢迎。原来想撒手不干的干部，通过学习毛主席著作和贫下中农的帮助，深刻认识到：搞好今年的春耕生产，对于夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利具有重大意义。革命干部是“抓革命，促生产”的一支骨干力量，在关键时刻，干部站不站出来挑重担，是对毛主席忠不忠的试金石。他们表示，坚决站出来革命，和贫下中农一起，担起革命和生产两副重担，在抓革命促生产中，为人民立新功。
    斗倒私心，当一辈子毛主席的好干部
    毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”这个大队的领导干部虽然都站了出来，身担了重担，但是他们还有私心杂念，没有牢固地树立为革命当一辈子好干部的思想。特别是以前犯过一点错误的干部，在文化大革命中又受了一些冲击，有“怨”气，存在着“换班”思想。有的认为，当干部一年辛辛苦苦，得罪了人，在运动中又要挨整，产生了“怕”字；也有人认为，自己当干部，群众不服从领导，“难”字又露了头。
    驻在这里的人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，针对干部的活思想，帮助他们办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，帮助他们反复学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和关于干部问题的教导，并引导他们回忆前几年西右营失权之苦，现在掌权之甜，用活生生的阶级斗争事例，深刻地教育了他们。解放军还帮助他们忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的迫害，讲毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，激起了他们的阶级感情。不少干部在斗私批修会上，检查了自己的资产阶级思想，斗倒了“怨”气，批判了“当干部吃亏”论，克服了“怕”字，换上了“敢”字，进一步树立了为人民服务的思想。
    大队党支部副书记张玉明，以前有“换班”思想，通过学习，心亮堂了。他决心用毛泽东思想为武器，破私立公，为贫下中农掌权，为贫下中农争气，听毛主席的话，当一辈子毛主席的好干部。曾被中国赫鲁晓夫在这里的代理人打成“反革命”、无理开除党籍七年的民兵连长徐忠义说：“毛主席他老人家最信任我们贫下中农和革命领导干部，我们就坚决听毛主席的话，为革命当一辈子干部，用好权，掌好权，使无产阶级铁打的江山，千秋万代永不变色。”
    革命领导干部要在春耕生产中做带头人
    毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”通过一年来的文化大革命，西右营大队干部的思想觉悟大大提高，他们想贫下中农所想，急贫下中农所急。他们最听毛主席的话，最相信和依靠贫下中农，坚决走社会主义道路。党支部的七名委员，五十多名生产队以上的干部，都能处处带头学习、工作和劳动。党支部团结得象一个人，结成了坚强的战斗集体。大队长孙庆喜腿上生病，走路有点困难，贫下中农劝他休息，他怎么也不肯，白天和社员一起劳动，晚上到贫下中农家里宣传毛泽东思想，还经常帮助五保户干些零活。今年一开春，干部就带头学毛主席著作，在生产中带头积肥、送肥。整个大队的政治空气从来没有象今天这样浓厚，社员的干劲从来没有象今天这样足。贫下中农对革命干部的一言一行，都看在眼里，记在心上，深受感动。
    “干群一条心，黄土变成金”。西右营大队的干部，和贫下中农眼往一处看，心往一处想，劲往一处使，道往一处走。他们在今年的春耕生产中，积极组织群众，积极领导群众，决心乘无产阶级文化大革命胜利的东风，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，夺取革命和生产双丰收。
