	The "Flying General descends from the heavens." The heroic people's liberation armed forces of South Vietnam launched a comprehensive offensive during the Lunar New Year, making a surprise attack on the U.S. "Embassy" in Saigon and achieving a brilliant victory. The news reached Washington, and the U.S. ruling class was terrified and lamenting.

	White House spokesman Christian exclaimed, "This is a rather serious incident." However, he pretended to say that the U.S. command in Saigon "knew in advance" that the South Vietnamese liberation army would launch a comprehensive offensive. He thought that this could at least save some face for the U.S. troops in Vietnam.

	According to Christian's statement, the U.S. troops in Vietnam are not that incompetent. Their intelligence is good, and they have a good grasp of the enemy's plans. However, if that is the case, why were they beaten so badly? Christian could not explain himself and had to helplessly admit that the U.S. military had "no effective means to defend against" such attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. In this way, Christian's poor attempt at self-derision only served to expose the helpless and passive situation of U.S. imperialism on the battlefield in South Vietnam.

	The clever and brave people's liberation armed forces of South Vietnam fully utilized the tremendous power of the people's war, concentrating superior forces to launch surprise attacks and ambushes, appearing and disappearing like ghosts, achieving victory through unconventional means. The U.S. invading forces have fought several years of war with the South Vietnamese liberation army and have suffered greatly. They indeed "knew in advance" the strategies and tactics of the South Vietnamese people's liberation armed forces.

	The people's liberation armed forces of South Vietnam not only roam the mountains and forests but can also launch fierce attacks on enemy bases and towns. The U.S. stronghold in Saigon has been attacked before. After the U.S. "Embassy" was bombed more than two years ago, the U.S. invaders rebuilt a sturdy new building, stationed heavy troops, and guarded it strictly. They indeed "knew in advance" that the South Vietnamese people's liberation armed forces would eventually come to attack them.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao, when discussing the strategies and tactics of the people's war, vividly said: "The enemy generally knows our temperaments well. However, the enemy cannot cancel our victories, nor can they avoid their losses." The U.S. invaders and their lackeys indeed know the temperaments of the South Vietnamese liberation army, but they cannot cancel the victories of the South Vietnamese liberation army, nor can they avoid their own losses. Alas, alas!

	The New Year's great victory of the South Vietnamese military and people once again shows that the people, and only the people, are the truly powerful force. Those like Christian, standing on the reactionary position of imperialism, will never understand this. The soldiers of the South Vietnamese liberation army fearlessly sacrifice themselves, fight bravely, and heroically kill the enemy, showing a great revolutionary spirit. This is something that those like Christian will never be able to understand. This is the tragedy of U.S. imperialism.

	No matter how desperately U.S. imperialism struggles, the war in Vietnam will inevitably end with the complete failure of U.S. imperialism and the final victory of the Vietnamese people. This is something that the leaders of the White House and the Pentagon should have "known in advance."

    拙劣的自我解嘲
    郭辛兵
    “飞将军自重霄入”。英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量在新春全面出击，奇袭西贡美国“大使馆”，取得辉煌的胜利。消息传到华盛顿，美国统治集团胆战心寒，叫苦不迭。
    白宫发言人克里斯琴惊呼：“这是一个相当严重的事件”。但是，他又装模作样地说什么美国驻西贡司令部“事先知道”南越解放军将发动全面攻势。他以为这样多少可以为侵越美军挽回一点面子。
    按照克里斯琴的说法，侵越美军并不是那末无能的。它的情报很灵，对于对手的行动计划颇能掌握。然而，既然如此，为什么它又会挨打挨得这样惨呢？克里斯琴不能自圆其说，只好无可奈何地承认，美军“没有什么严密的办法来防御”对西贡美国大使馆进行的这种袭击。这样一来，克里斯琴拙劣的自我解嘲，只能欲盖弥彰地暴露出美帝国主义在南越战场上手足无措、被动挨打的窘态。
    机智勇敢的南越人民解放武装力量充分发挥人民战争的强大威力，集中优势兵力，进行奇袭、伏击，神出鬼没，出奇制胜。美国侵略军与南越解放军打了几年仗，吃够了苦头。他们对于南越人民解放武装力量的一套战略战术，确实是“事先知道”的。
    南越人民解放武装力量不但驰骋于山林原野，而且能够猛袭敌军据守的基地和城镇。西贡的美伪巢穴遭受袭击，这也不是破题儿第一遭。在两年多以前美国“大使馆”挨炸以后，美国侵略者就曾重盖坚固的新楼，派了重兵，严加防守。他们对于南越人民解放武装力量迟早要来揍他们，确实是“事先知道”的。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在论述人民战争的战略战术时，生动地说过：“敌人一般地都摸熟我们的脾气了。然而敌人不能取消我们的胜利，也不能避免他们的损失”。美国侵略者及其走狗是摸熟了南越解放军的脾气的，但是他们不能取消南越解放军的胜利，也不能避免他们自己的损失。奈何，奈何！
    南越军民新春大捷再一次表明，人民，只有人民才是真正强大的力量。克里斯琴之流站在帝国主义反动立场上，对于这一点是永远不会懂得的。南越解放军战士在战斗中不怕牺牲，前赴后继，英勇杀敌，表现出大无畏的革命英雄气概。这也是克里斯琴之流所永远无法理解的。这正是美帝国主义的可悲之处。
    美帝国主义不管怎样疯狂挣扎，侵越战争必然以美帝国主义的彻底失败、越南人民的最后胜利而告终。这一点，白宫和五角大楼的头目们早就应该“事先知道”了。
