Heroic Lao patriotic military and civilians, following their great victory at Nam Bao, have advanced to launch a fierce offensive against the enemy, recently capturing a series of enemy strongholds.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Kengtung on the 26th, the Patriotic Front of Laos reported that on the morning of February 21, the patriotic forces in Xieng Khouang Province attacked and occupied the headquarters of the 23rd Battalion of the right-wing Lao military stationed about 60 kilometers northeast of the provincial capital in Tathom. They also inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy forces attempting to rescue them and pursued the remaining enemy troops, killing and wounding a large number of enemy soldiers.

Tathom is a "strong" stronghold of the enemy on the way to the provincial capital of Phonsavan in Phou Khoun Province. This area was once under the control of the patriotic forces in 1961, but was later occupied by the right-wing military, turning it into a springboard for their encroaching attacks on the Char Plain and other liberated areas in Xieng Khouang Province.

On the 20th, after a night of fierce battle, the Lao patriotic military and civilians captured an important position of a series of enemy forces near Xieng Khouang. In the pursuit of the enemy, they annihilated 12 enemy soldiers. Since the beginning of this year, the guerrilla forces in this area have smashed the enemy's "sweeping" operations that lasted for several weeks, annihilating 350 enemy soldiers. Following this, they continuously and fiercely attacked the enemy's strongholds, forcing the enemy to withdraw from four strongholds and killing and wounding 40 enemy soldiers.

In the southern region, the Lao People's Liberation Army is advancing towards the strategic town of Saravane Province, completely surrounding Saravane Town. On the 23rd, the Lao People's Liberation Army attacked and entered a frontline stronghold in Lakhone, about 40 kilometers southwest of Saravane, which guards Saravane, causing heavy casualties to the defending enemy and shooting down one enemy aircraft. The enemy forces in the three frontline strongholds west of Saravane, fearing the offensive of the People's Liberation Army, abandoned their strongholds and fled in panic. On the 24th, the People's Liberation Army also shelled Saravane.

The local forces and guerrilla units in Muan District, Luang Prabang Province, launched a surprise attack on the enemy headquarters in the district capital before dawn on January 23, killing one American colonel, one lieutenant colonel, and one official from the American "aid mission," as well as four colonel-level and three lieutenant-level puppet military officers. On the same day, the patriotic armed forces also attacked nearby enemy positions. In these several attacks, the patriotic armed forces annihilated a total of 55 enemy soldiers.

    继南博大捷后乘胜前进
    老挝爱国军民又攻克敌人一系列据点
    据新华社康开二十六日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，英雄的老挝爱国军民，继南博大捷之后，乘胜前进，向敌人展开了猛烈攻势，最近又攻克了一系列敌军据点。
    川圹省爱国力量二月二十一日清晨，攻占了驻在川圹省省会东北六十公里塔通的老挝右派军队第二十三营营部，并且痛击企图前往救援的敌军，追击周围残军，打死打伤大批敌军。
    塔通是敌人通向坡里坎省省会北汕的一个“强固”据点。这个地区一九六一年曾在爱国力量控制下，后来为右派军队占据，把它变成向查尔平原和川圹省其他解放区发动蚕食进攻的跳板。
    二十日，老挝爱国军民在经过彻夜激战之后，攻占了北汕附近的一连敌军的重要阵地。在追击敌军的战斗中，歼敌十二名。自今年一月初以来，这个地区的游击队粉碎了敌人长达几周的“扫荡”，歼敌三百五十名，接着，不断狠狠袭击敌人的老巢，迫使敌军从四个据点撤出，打死打伤敌人四十名。
    在下寮地区，老挝人民解放军直逼战略要地沙拉湾省省会，把沙拉湾镇团团围住。二十三日老挝人民解放军曾攻入距沙拉湾西南四十公里、守卫沙拉湾的前哨据点寮岸，使守敌遭到严重伤亡，击落敌机一架。沙拉湾以西三个前哨据点的敌军，慑于人民解放军的攻势，丢弃据点，望风而逃。二十四日，人民解放军又炮击沙拉湾。
    琅勃拉邦省芒显县的地方部队和游击队，一月二十三日黎明前，突然袭击了在这个县府中的敌军总部，打死美国上校一名、中校一名和美国“援助代表团”的官员一名，还打死傀儡军校级军官四名和尉级军官三名。同日，爱国武装力量又对附近的敌军阵地发动了攻击。爱国武装力量在这几次袭击中总共歼灭了敌军五十五名。
