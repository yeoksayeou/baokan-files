Commentator of the Liberation Army of South Vietnam recently published an article discussing the great significance of the recent victories of the military and people of South Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. The article calls on the military and people of South Vietnam to redouble their efforts, overcome all difficulties, and bravely advance to decisively defeat the puppet army, overthrow the puppet regime, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

The article states that the most outstanding feature of the victories achieved by the heroic military and people of South Vietnam in the past two weeks of the Tet Offensive is that they launched fierce and extensive attacks on enemy strongholds in almost all towns across South Vietnam, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the enemy. A significant portion of the enemy's important combat forces and large quantities of war equipment have been destroyed.

The article states that the enemy's forces have rapidly weakened. They have never suffered such heavy casualties. This is unprecedented since the American bandits directly invaded the South. Approximately half of the puppet army has been destroyed and disintegrated, making them even weaker and irredeemable.

The article points out that the entire rural population of the South, in close cooperation with local armed forces, has launched an unprecedented great struggle, achieving tremendous victories. The entire rural areas of the provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien have been completely liberated, and a significant portion of the Western Highlands, the central coastal plains, and the southern plains have been basically liberated. The liberation of most rural areas in the South is a great victory for the people of the South, with extremely significant strategic implications.

The article states that the more we fight, the stronger we become, which is the law of development in our anti-American, national salvation war. Especially in the past fifteen days of combat, the development of various liberation armed forces has vividly demonstrated this law. The article points out that the three types of armed forces are developing rapidly. In all districts, provinces, cities, and counties, many new units equipped with enemy weapons have been established. In every village, commune, and neighborhood, many guerrilla and self-defense forces have been added.

The article states that while the various liberation armed forces are increasing in number, they have also made rapid progress in quality. Another outstanding progress is the extremely excellent coordination on all battlefields, which makes the enemy very frightened. The article states that the close unity within the military and between the military and the people is a very important factor in the rapid development of our army.

The article states that the brilliant victories we achieved in the fifteen days of the Tet Offensive have created an unprecedentedly favorable strategic situation for us. The article states that our very favorable strategic situation is clearly reflected in the urban and rural battlefields, even on every front line. This is the situation where we have divided the enemy, where the iron noose of people's war is tightly around the necks of the American bandits and their lackeys, making them deeply trapped in a completely passive defensive disadvantage, in an unprecedentedly difficult situation, and unable to avoid a shameful defeat.

The article states that our military and people's victories have proven a clear fact: any nation, no matter how small and poor, as long as it has a correct revolutionary line, a thorough revolutionary spirit, unity of all the people, and a strict organization, it will definitely have the ability to defeat the invaders, no matter how ferocious and brutal the imperialist leaders are. The article states that our Tet Offensive victories have also made the enemy's internal contradictions unprecedentedly sharp, pushing American imperialism into an unprecedentedly serious and irredeemable crisis.

The article states that our military and people's victories are immensely great. But the battles are still extremely fierce and cruel. Our military and people must make extraordinary efforts, overcome difficulties, fear no sacrifices, and with the momentum of victory, continuously charge forward, launching decisive, continuous, and extensive attacks on all battlefields.

The article states that with a firm belief in ultimate victory, we are determined to defeat the puppet army, overthrow the entire puppet regime system, thoroughly frustrate the aggressive ambitions of the American bandits, and seize the power for the people.

    越南南方解放军评论员就新春攻势发出战斗号召
    打败美帝  推翻伪政权  建立人民政权
    伪军被消灭和瓦解一半  完全解放了广治—承天农村地区
    据新华社河内二十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方解放军评论员最近发表文章，阐述越南南方军民新春大捷的重大意义，号召越南南方军民加倍努力，克服一切艰难困苦，奋勇前进，坚决打垮伪军，推翻伪政权，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    文章说，英雄的越南南方军民新春两周来的胜利的最突出的特点是：我们军民在同一个时候，向全南方几乎所有城镇里的敌人巢穴发动了猛烈和广泛的进攻，使敌人遭到极其惨重的损失，消灭了敌人的一部分十分重要的有生力量和大量战争工具。
    文章说，敌人的各方面的力量迅速削弱。他们从来也没有遭到这样惨重的伤亡。这是美国强盗直接侵略南方以来前所未有的现象。伪军已被消灭和瓦解约百分之五十。这使他们更加虚弱，无可挽救。
    文章指出，南方全体农村人民同当地武装力量紧密配合，掀起了一个前所未有的伟大的斗争高潮，取得了巨大的胜利，完全解放了广治—承天两省的全部农村地区，基本上解放了西原地区、中部沿海平原和南部平原的大部分地区。南方农村大部分地区获得解放，这是南方人民的巨大胜利，具有十分重大的战略意义。
    文章说，愈战愈强，这是我们军民在抗美救国战争中的发展规律。特别是各种解放武装力量在最近十五天战斗中的发展，更生动地体现了这一规律。文章指出，三种武装力量正在飞跃地发展。在所有各个区、省、城市和县，都成立了许多用敌人的武器装备起来的新的单位。在各个村、乡和街区，都增加了许多游击队和自卫队。
    文章说，各种解放武装力量在发展数量的同时，在质量上也有了飞速的提高。再一个突出的进步，是所有各个战场的极其漂亮的配合。这使敌人非常害怕。文章说，军队内部和军民之间亲密无间的团结一致，是我军飞跃发展的一个非常重要的因素。
    文章说，我们在新春十五天里取得的辉煌胜利，为我们创造了前所未有的十分良好的战略形势。文章说，我们十分良好的战略形势，十分清楚地体现在城市和农村的各个战场上，甚至在每一条战线上。这就是我们把敌人分割开来的形势，是人民战争的铁绞索正紧紧地套在美国强盗及其走狗的脖子上，使它们深深陷于完全被动的防御劣势，处境空前困难，避免不了可耻失败的形势。
  文章说，我们军民的胜利证明了一个明显的事实：任何一个民族，即使是小而穷，只要有正确的革命路线，有彻底革命的精神，有万众一心的团结，有严密的组织，就完全有足够的能力战胜侵略者，那怕是最凶恶、残暴的帝国主义头子。文章说，我们的新春大捷还使敌人的内部矛盾空前尖锐，使美帝国主义陷入了一个空前严重和无法挽救的危机。
    文章说，我们军民的胜利，是无比巨大的胜利。但战斗还是无比激烈和残酷的。我们军民必须作出非凡的努力，克服艰难困苦，不怕牺牲，以胜利者的气势，不断地冲上前去，在各个战场上发动坚决的、连续的和广泛的进攻。
    文章说，我们怀着对最后胜利的坚强信念，决心打垮伪军，推翻整个伪政权系统，彻底挫败美国强盗的侵略野心，把政权夺到人民手里。
