A photo exhibition themed around the propagation of Chairman Mao Zedong's invincible thought and the introduction of the brilliant victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was first displayed in Ichinomiya City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, on February 18. It was warmly welcomed by the Japanese people.

A large portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, and a red banner with Chairman Mao's quotation, "Except for the monopolistic capital and militaristic clique that are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends," were hung at the entrance of the exhibition hall. The exhibition displayed 100 pictures introducing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

Workers, office employees, students, and housewives from Ichinomiya City, with deep affection for Chairman Mao and friendly feelings toward the Chinese people, eagerly visited the exhibition.

Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. Many visitors gazed at the photo of Chairman Mao waving to the millions of cultural revolutionaries and were reluctant to leave. A Japanese worker said, "Chairman Mao is not only the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese people, but also of the world's revolutionary people."

The chairman of the Aichi Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Authentic), Murai Seiichi, told a Chinese reporter at the exhibition site that Chairman Mao had summarized the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and greatly developed Marxism-Leninism on the theory and practice of the proletarian dictatorship. He found the only correct path to prevent capitalist restoration in socialist countries.

Murai said that Chairman Mao fully trusted and relied on the masses, leading this unprecedented and world-shaking great revolution. He emphasized that only Chairman Mao could achieve this.

A worker-turned-social activist excitedly said that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, based on its decisive victory last year, has entered a new stage of achieving comprehensive victory this year. He congratulated the revolutionary committees established by the proletarian revolutionary factions in various parts of China. He emphasized that the brilliant victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution greatly inspires the Japanese people and people around the world, and deals a heavy blow to U.S.-led imperialism, reactionaries in various countries, Soviet modern revisionism, and Japanese Communist Party revisionism.

This activist said that China is becoming a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. If the whole world becomes a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, then imperialism and all reactionaries will have no place to hide. He expressed his determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and advance along the revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao for the Japanese people.

A trade union cadre from Ichinomiya said that after seeing the photo exhibition, he was more convinced that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution would achieve comprehensive victory. He said, "This exhibition has helped us workers raise our awareness and strongly refuted the enemy's slanders and defamations against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

A university student said that the comprehensive victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution would make the world revolution's base—China—even stronger and more consolidated. The victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful support for the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism and for the oppressed nations and peoples struggling for national independence and liberation around the world.

This student said, "We deeply feel that the victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also our victory, the Japanese people's victory, because the common struggle against imperialism and revisionism has linked the destinies of our two peoples."

The bookstore set up in the exhibition hall attracted a large number of visitors. It sold Chairman Mao's works and various magazines published in China. The most popular book was the Little Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and the various styles of shining golden Mao badges were loved by everyone. A high school student bought an English version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and expressed his hope to see the Japanese version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" published by China as soon as possible. Many Japanese students eagerly bought the long-awaited Mao badges. A middle school student wore a Mao badge on his chest and excitedly told a Chinese reporter, "Mao Zedong is a great man. I pay my respects to him."

This photo exhibition of the People's Republic of China was organized by the Aichi Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Authentic). The exhibition was greatly assisted by the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association. The exhibition will also be displayed in other parts of Japan.

    中国文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的新阶段
    文化大革命的辉煌胜利鼓舞世界人民，沉重打击帝修反
    新华社东京十九日电　以宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想和介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利为主题的中华人民共和国图片展览会，十八日在日本爱知县一宫市首次展出，受到了日本人民的极热烈的欢迎。
    会场入口处的正面中央悬挂着全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像和红色横幅的毛主席语录：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”展览会共展出了介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的图片一百幅。
    一宫市的工人、职员、学生、家庭妇女，怀着对毛主席的深厚感情和对中国人民的亲切友谊，踊跃地前去参观。
    毛主席是全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。不少观众望着毛主席向百万文化革命大军招手的照片，久久不愿离去。一位日本工人说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的，也是全世界革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手。”
    日中友好协会（正统）爱知县总部理事长村井瀞一在会场上对中国记者说，毛主席总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，在理论上和实践上大大地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说，找出了一条保证社会主义国家不出现资本主义复辟的唯一正确道路。
    村井说，毛主席充分相信和依靠群众，领导了这样一场史无前例的、震撼全世界的大革命。他强调说，只有毛主席才能做到这一点。
    一位工人出身的社会活动家兴奋地说，中国无产阶级文化大革命在去年取得决定性胜利的基础上，今年进入了夺取全面胜利的新阶段。他对中国各地的无产阶级革命派迅速实现革命大联合，相继成立革命委员会，表示祝贺。
    他强调指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，给日本人民和全世界人民以无限鼓舞，给以美国为首的帝国主义、各国反动派、苏联现代修正主义、日共修正主义以沉重打击。
    这位活动家说，中国正在成为毛泽东思想的大学校。如果全世界都成为毛泽东思想的大学校，那么，帝国主义和一切反动派就没有藏身之地了。他表示今后要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，遵循毛主席的教导，沿着毛主席给日本人民指出的革命道路前进。
    一宫地方的一位工会干部说，看了图片展览，使他更加相信中国无产阶级文化大革命一定会取得全面胜利。他说：“这个展览会帮助我们工人提高了觉悟，同时又有力地粉碎了敌人对中国无产阶级文化大革命的造谣和诬蔑。”
    一位大学生说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，将使世界革命的根据地——中国更加强大和巩固。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是对正在同美帝国主义进行英勇斗争的越南人民、对全世界为争取民族独立和解放而斗争的被压迫民族和被压迫人民的强有力的支援。
    这位大学生说，我们深切地感到，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，也是我们日本人民的胜利，因为反帝反修的共同斗争把我们两国人民的命运联结在一起。
    会场内设立的售书处吸引了大批观众。那里出售毛主席著作和中国出版的各种杂志。红色宝书《毛主席语录》是最受欢迎的书，各种式样的金光闪闪的毛主席像章，更是人人喜爱。一位高中学生购买了一本英文版《毛主席语录》后，还表示希望尽快地能够看到中国翻译出版的日文版《毛泽东选集》。大批日本学生争相购买渴望已久的毛主席像章。一位中学生把毛主席像章戴在胸前，兴奋地向中国记者说：“毛泽东是伟人，我向他老人家致敬。”
    这次中华人民共和国图片展览会，是日中友好协会（正统）爱知县总部举办的。展览会得到了日中文化交流协会的大力协助。这个展览会还将在日本其他地方展出。
