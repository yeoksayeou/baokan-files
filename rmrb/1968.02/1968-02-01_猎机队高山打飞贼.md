At a meeting held by the Party Committee of P Township in the northern Vietnamese province of Thanh Hoa, participants were discussing how to install machine guns on a high mountain to annihilate American aggressor planes. The township's militia chief, Ho Van Thoi, decisively said, "As long as we have the determination, anything is possible. Based on our observations of enemy plane activities, I believe it is feasible to install guns on the mountain to strike the enemy planes. I suggest the Party Committee decide to let the militia try it out first and establish a position on the mountain."

The next morning, Ho Van Thoi and five soldiers marched towards the mountain. They traversed the forest, crossed the valley, and from sunrise to sunset, they still hadn't found a path to the mountain. That night, they had to return to the village. The Party Committee decided to discuss the issue with the villagers and let everyone contribute ideas.

A 72-year-old veteran hunter, Ho Van Na, said that in his youth, he had once shot a mountain goat and followed its blood trail up the mountain. However, the path was very treacherous. This was a long time ago, and his memory was fuzzy. But it didn't matter, they could try to find the path.

The militia member, Ho Van Du, followed Old Man Na. They ran along the foot of the mountain but still couldn't find the path. Old Man Na stopped by a large rock, observed for a while, and said, "That's right, the goat ran up from here."

Ho Van Du and the other militia members followed the direction indicated by Old Man Na, cutting through the bushes, crossing deep ravines, climbing ropes, and stepping on stone walls, step by step, they opened a path up the mountain.

After the initial exploration, the Party Committee and the township militia department decided to speed up the action and open a path to the mountain. The Youth League dispatched young, strong, and skilled climbers and hunters to take on this task. Some young people prepared bridges and ladders to cross deep ravines and steep cliffs, transporting large logs from the foot of the mountain to the top to build fortifications. The path was rugged and dangerous, the task was arduous, but no one bowed down to the difficulties. Twenty-six young people from the township, through eight days of selfless labor, achieved the first victory, forcing the treacherous mountain forest to yield, allowing these sharpshooters to go up the mountain to fight the American air bandits. The P Township Hunter Squad conducted a meticulous study of the enemy planes' routes and tactics, laying a dense net of fire, and immediately intensified training to adapt to the new combat environment. Thus, the formation to annihilate the American aggressor planes was set up.

One day, the P Township Hunter Squad marched all night, and the next morning, they appeared on the mountaintop. As the militia members were preparing for battle, suddenly came the voice of the observer, Ho Van Khe, "Enemy planes appear in the northwest!" The township militia chief, Ho Van Thoi, immediately ordered, "Prepare for battle!"

The enemy planes came in three groups, each with two planes. The first group of enemy planes circled in the high sky, attempting to confuse people, and then dive down with the help of the sun. Ho Van Thoi closely watched it, chose the right moment, and ordered to open fire.

A burst of seven bullets was fired, and the American plane quickly flew low, attempting to avoid ground fire, but it could not escape the second layer of fire from the combat team. The enemy plane was hit and crashed towards the southwest. At this time, the second plane dived towards the position, and the other enemy planes also simultaneously bombed. The Hunter Squad did not miss the good opportunity to annihilate the enemy, bravely aiming at the enemy planes and fiercely opening fire, shooting them in a panic, and fleeing with their tails between their legs.

    猎机队高山打飞贼
    上山
    在越南北方清化县P乡党委召开的会议上，参加会议的人正在讨论如何把机枪安到高山上去歼灭美国强盗飞机的问题。乡武装部主任何文世果断地说：“只要有决心，什么事情也办得成。按照我们观察敌机活动的经验，我看把枪安到山上，是有可能打击敌机的。我建议党委决定让民兵先试一试，到山上去建立一个阵地。”
    第二天早上，何文世和五位战士向这座山进军。他们穿过森林，越过谷地，从红日东升直到太阳西斜，还没有找到一条通往山上的道路。当晚只好再返回村里。党委决定把问题交给村民讨论，让大家献计。
    一位具有打猎经验的七十二岁老农何文纳说，他在年轻的时候，曾经打伤过一只山羊，并且沿着山羊血迹追上山去过。不过这条路非常险阻。这是很久以前的事，现在印象也模糊了。但不要紧，可以摸索一下。
    找路
    民兵何文犹随着纳老大爷先走。他们沿着山脚跑了一圈，仍然找不到路。纳老大爷在一块大石旁停步，观察一会儿说：“对了，山羊是从这里跑上去的。”
    何文犹和其他民兵按着纳老大爷所指的方向，斩荆伐树，跨越深渊，手攀绳索，脚踏石壁，一步一步地往上开路。
    经过首次的探索，党委和乡武装部决定加速行动，开辟一条上山的路。团支部派出年轻力壮、善于爬山和打猎的青年担负这个任务。有的青年则准备搭桥和梯子，以便越过深渊和陡壁，把大木块从山脚运上山顶，修筑工事。路途崎岖险阻，任务艰巨繁重，但是却没有人在困难面前低头。乡里的二十六位青年在八天忘我劳动中，取得了首战的胜利，迫使险阻的山林让路，让这些神枪手上山去打美国空中强盗。P乡猎机队对敌机的航线和战术进行了精密的研究，布下严密的火网，随后立即加紧练习，以适应新的战斗环境。就这样，歼灭美国强盗飞机的阵势摆开了。
   立功
   有一天，P乡猎机队整夜行军，第二天一清早，就出现在山顶上了。民兵们正在进行战斗准备工作的时候，忽然传来了观测员何文奎的声音：“西北方向出现敌机！”乡武装部主任何文世立即下令：“准备战斗！”
    敌机分成三批，每批两架。第一批敌机在高空盘旋，妄图迷惑人，然后借助阳光俯冲下去。何文世紧紧盯住它，选择适当的时机，下令开火。
    一排七颗子弹发射出去，美国飞机迅速低飞，企图避开地面火力，但是它逃不脱战斗组的第二层火力，敌机中弹了，向着西南方向栽了下去。这时，第二架敌机向阵地俯冲，其它的敌机也同时投弹轰炸。猎机队毫不放松歼敌的好时机，勇敢地瞄准敌机猛烈开火，打得它们惊魂失魄，夹着尾巴逃之夭夭。
