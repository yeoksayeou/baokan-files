The revolutionary workers of the Equipment Assistance Office at the Machinery Plant of Wuhan Steel Company have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." With the cooperation of relevant departments, they have overcome various difficulties and successfully manufactured five new types of lathes.

The Equipment Assistance Office of Wuhan Steel Machinery Plant is responsible for the maintenance of all machines in the company. However, due to insufficient equipment, production improvements were hindered. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of this office resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They decided to use the existing dozen or so machines to manufacture equipment and expand production capacity. Their initiative was enthusiastically supported by all revolutionary workers in the plant. The revolutionary workers of this office, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching to "make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory," smashed the sabotage and obstruction by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. In difficult circumstances, they always stayed at their posts and never stopped the trial production of machines. With the support of all workers in the plant, after ten months of arduous struggle, they finally successfully manufactured the first batch of lathes, which greatly promoted production.
