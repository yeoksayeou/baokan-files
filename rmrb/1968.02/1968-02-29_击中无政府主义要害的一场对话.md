	A Dialogue That Hits the Nail on the Head of Anarchism

	Old Zhao: “The eight-hour workday is a victory hard-won by our working class through long-term struggle. What’s wrong with it? You say that going up the shaft early is a rebellion against the old system, then why don’t you go up the shaft late and work a few more hours to produce more coal for the country? I think you’ve been poisoned by anarchist thoughts; it’s your selfishness at work!”

	Little Wang: “Yes! If I really wanted to rebel against the old system, why wouldn’t I go up the shaft late? I go up the shaft early just to work less and rest more, to benefit myself.”

	The foreman of the 361 Coal Mining Team at the Niu Xin Tai Coal Mine, Zhao Renfu, had been pondering over something recently: the worker Wang Lichun always goes down the shaft three times a day but comes up after the first shift, working only three or four hours in the shaft each day. How can this be allowed? Does he have something to attend to at home? But he hasn’t asked for leave. Is he sick? He’s a strong young man. What’s really going on in his head?

	Zhao Renfu thought: “To seize the revolution and promote production” is the battle cry issued by Chairman Mao to us coal miners. We must carry it out resolutely. But someone like Wang Lichun, who casually breaks labor discipline, coming and going as he pleases, isn’t this pure anarchism? He thought of this and made up his mind: he must help Wang Lichun turn around.

	One day, Zhao Renfu sat down with Wang Lichun. Old Zhao took out a red copy of “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” saying: “Come, let’s study a passage from Chairman Mao’s quotations. Chairman Mao teaches us: ‘We must raise our discipline, resolutely carry out orders, policies, and the three main disciplines and eight points for attention… We do not allow any phenomenon of breaking discipline to exist.’ Chairman Mao’s words, we must…”

	Before Zhao Renfu could finish, Wang Lichun was already getting angry, saying, “Why do you want me to study this passage? Who’s breaking discipline? I’m rebelling against those old disciplines and old systems!”

	It seemed that Wang Lichun had not realized that his disregard for labor discipline was wrong.

	Foreman Zhao Renfu did not mind Wang Lichun’s interruption. He stood up and walked to the window, calling Little Wang to his side, facing the mine outside the window, he said: “Little Wang, do you know the bloody history of the miners at Niu Xin Tai Coal Mine?” Wang Lichun did not answer because this new miner indeed did not know the history of the mine before liberation.

	Thinking of the days before liberation, Zhao Renfu’s heart ached as if it were being cut by a knife. He recounted the bloody life of the miners in those days with tears in his eyes: the miners lived like cattle, wearing sackcloth and eating acorn flour. The capitalists only cared about producing more coal, not about the lives of the workers. Underground collapses and gas explosions took countless lives; countless class brothers died under the overseers’ clubs. At that time, there was no fixed working time; once they went down the shaft, they had to work for fifteen or sixteen hours. Speaking of this, Zhao Renfu raised his voice: “It was Chairman Mao who led us workers to rebel against the old world, ending the bloody rule of the exploiting classes. Since then, the miners of Niu Xin Tai have been able to stand tall and become the masters of the mine. Look now, the status of the miners has been elevated, their lives have improved, all thanks to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao thinks of us workers, establishing the eight-hour workday for us, what greater care is this for us workers! But you…” Zhao Renfu was so moved that he couldn’t continue. At this moment, Wang Lichun was like a child who had done something wrong, lowering his head. Zhao Renfu continued: “Young people, when doing anything, you must analyze it with Mao Zedong Thought. The eight-hour workday is a victory hard-won by our working class through long-term struggle. What’s wrong with it? You say that going up the shaft early is a rebellion against the old system, then why don’t you go up the shaft late and work a few more hours to produce more coal for the country? I think you’ve been poisoned by anarchist thoughts; it’s your selfishness at work!”

	Zhao Renfu hit the nail on the head. Wang Lichun’s face turned red, and he began to question himself: “Yes! If I really wanted to rebel against the old system, why wouldn’t I go up the shaft late? I go up the shaft early just to work less and rest more, to benefit myself.” He suddenly realized that he had been wrong, saying in a low voice: “Foreman Zhao, I was wrong. I did not work according to the eight-hour workday established by Chairman Mao for us. My selfishness is too heavy!”

	Zhao Renfu heard Little Wang’s words and couldn’t help but smile, feeling happy from the bottom of his heart. He patted Wang Lichun’s shoulder and said: “Good, as long as you’ve realized it. The character ‘self’ is the biggest root of evil. Anarchism uses ‘self’ to poison us, so we must pay attention! Never relax your ideological reform, never relax your study of Mao Zedong Thought!”

	The old miner’s lively class education lesson made Wang Lichun’s heart bright. He expressed his determination to the foreman: “In the future, I will definitely study Mao Zedong Thought well and completely break with anarchism.” The hands of the two generations of miners were tightly held together.

	Not long after, the broadcaster of Niu Xin Tai Coal Mine announced to the entire mine: “Wang Lichun of the 361 Coal Mining Team, with the spirit of Dr. Norman Bethune’s extreme responsibility for work, has shown selfless labor in his work, ensuring the smooth operation of the chute at the lower slope, and has made new achievements in creating the highest coal production record since February.”

    击中无政府主义要害的一场对话
    老赵：“八小时工作制是咱工人阶级长期斗争得来的胜利果实，它有那点不对？你说提前升井是造旧制度的反，那你为什么不晚升井，多干几小时，为国家多出点煤炭呢？我看你是受了无政府主义思想的毒害，是私心作怪！”
    小王：“是啊！如果我真的是为了打破旧制度，为什么不晚升井呢？我提前升井，还不是为了少干活，多休息，为自己打算吗？”
    本溪牛心台煤矿三六一采煤队队长赵仁福，前些日子一直在琢磨着一件事：工人王立春老是三趟车下井，头趟车上来，一天在井下只干三四个小时的活儿。这怎么能行呢？是家里有事吗？可他并没有请事假。是身体有病吗？他可是个硬梆梆的小伙子。究竟是什么东西在他头脑里作怪呢？
    赵仁福想：“抓革命，促生产”，是毛主席向咱煤矿工人发出的战斗号令，咱们一定要坚决照办。可是，象王立春这样随便破坏劳动纪律，想来就来，想走就走，这不纯粹是闹无政府主义吗？他想到这里，便下定决心：一定要帮助王立春转变过来。
    一天，赵仁福和王立春坐在一起。老赵拿出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，说：“来！咱们学一段毛主席语录。毛主席教导我们说：‘必须提高纪律性，坚决执行命令，执行政策，执行三大纪律八项注意，……不允许任何破坏纪律的现象存在。’毛主席的话，咱们可要……。”
    还没等赵仁福说完，王立春就有点受不了啦，气虎虎地说：“你让我学这条语录干什么？谁破坏纪律啦？对过去那些旧纪律、旧制度，我就是要造反！”看来，王立春并没有认识到自己不遵守劳动纪律是不对的。
    老队长赵仁福丝毫没有计较王立春的顶撞，他站起来走到窗前，把小王叫到身旁，面对着窗外的矿井说：“小王啊，你可知道咱牛心台煤矿血泪斑斑的矿工史吗？”王立春没有答话，因为这位新矿工确实不知道解放前的矿山血泪史。
    一想起解放前，赵仁福的心就象刀搅一样难受。他含着辛酸的泪花，叙述起当年矿山血泪生活：矿工们过着牛马般的生活，穿的是麻袋片，吃的是橡子面。资本家只顾多出煤，那管工人的死活，井下冒顶，瓦斯爆炸，不知夺去了多少人的生命；也不知道有多少阶级兄弟，死在工头的榔头下。那时候，那有固定的工作时间，一下井就得干十五六个小时。说到这里，赵仁福提高了嗓门：“是毛主席他老人家，领导咱工人阶级，造了旧世界的反，结束了剥削阶级的血腥统治。从此，咱牛心台矿工人才直起了腰，当了矿山的主人。你看现在，矿工地位提高了，生活改善了，这都是毛主席给咱带来的。毛主席他老人家，心里想着咱工人阶级，给咱订了八小时工作制，这是对咱工人的多大关怀！可是你……。”赵仁福说到这里，激动得说不下去了。此时，王立春就象一个做了错事的孩子，低下了脑袋。赵仁福接着说：“年轻人啊，做什么事都要用毛泽东思想去分析分析，八小时工作制是咱工人阶级长期斗争得来的胜利果实，它有那点不对？你说提前升井是造旧制度的反，那你为什么不晚升井，多干几小时，为国家多出点煤炭呢？我看你是受了无政府主义思想的毒害，是私心作怪！”
    赵仁福一针见血地把问题揭开了。王立春面色通红，开始反问自己：“是啊！如果我真的是为了打破旧制度，为什么不晚升井呢？我提前升井，还不是为了少干活，多休息，为自己打算吗？”他猛然觉悟过来，觉得自己过去太不对了，便低声说：“赵队长，我错了，我没有按照毛主席为咱制定的八小时工作制去工作。我的私心太重了！”
    赵仁福听了小王的话，不觉满面笑容，打心眼里高兴。他拍着王立春的肩膀说：“好，认识到了就好了。‘私’字是个最大的祸根，无政府主义就是利用‘私’字来毒害我们的，可要引起咱们的注意呀！万万不要放松自己的思想改造，万万不要放松对毛泽东思想的学习！”
    老矿工的一堂生动的阶级教育课，使王立春心里亮堂了。他向老队长表示决心：“今后，我一定要很好地学习毛泽东思想，彻底地和无政府主义决裂。”两代矿工的手紧紧地握在一起了。
    不久后的一天，牛心台煤矿的广播员，向全矿广播了这样一个消息：“三六一采煤队的王立春同志，以白求恩同志对工作极端负责任的精神要求自己，在工作中发扬了忘我劳动的精神，保证了下溜口的溜子畅通无阻，为创造二月份以来产煤的最高纪录立了新功。”
