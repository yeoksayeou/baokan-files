Chairman Mao said: "On the side of our enemy, everything is just the opposite. They are so corrupt, so full of increasing internal disputes that cannot be resolved, so hated by the people and completely isolated, and have suffered so many defeats, that they are inevitably heading towards destruction."

South Vietnamese Military and Civilians Score Big Victory; Washington in Chaos

The American ruling class is thrown into confusion by the New Year offensive of the South Vietnamese military and civilians, revealing their ugly true colors.

New China News Agency, February 21st: Our correspondent reports: The heroic military and civilians of South Vietnam have launched a series of widespread and comprehensive attacks since the New Year, not only sweeping the U.S. aggressors and their puppets off the battlefield in South Vietnam like a rolling mat, leaving them disoriented and in disarray, but also causing chaos within the American ruling class, triggering a new and increasingly fierce dispute. According to reports, recently, the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson has been like an ant on a hot pan: on one hand, he is constantly anxious, watching the situation in South Vietnam; on the other hand, he has to desperately fend off various accusations and attacks from within the American ruling class. Reuters reported that Johnson has recently appeared "tired and tense," his expression reflecting his inner "misery and panic."

Hot Pan Ant, Panic Stricken

The thunderous cannon fire of the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces attacking the U.S. puppet army has also caused a strong shock to the White House on the other side of the Pacific. According to reports, during tense times, Johnson, due to his restless mind, often stays up all night, sometimes rushing to the "situation room" in the middle of the night to look at battle reports. These reports, which reflect the defeats of the U.S. military, sometimes number more than a thousand a day, but Johnson still frequently uses the telephone and telegrams to communicate with the U.S. military leaders in Vietnam, anxiously inquiring about the development of the battlefield situation. In order to reassure himself, he even hysterically ordered the Joint Chiefs of Staff to guarantee the defense of the Xuan Loc base, which had already fallen into a siege.

At the same time, Johnson and his military and political subordinates, such as Rusk and McNamara, have issued statements one after another, attempting to downplay the glorious victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and civilians, and to calm the public. But even in these statements, they cannot completely hide their inner panic. Johnson exclaimed: The situation in South Vietnam is "very serious"; Rusk lamented: The United States is facing a "difficult situation" in South Vietnam; McNamara, who was dismissed from his position as Secretary of Defense due to the failure in Vietnam and is about to step down at the end of February, anxiously said that he is "counting the days," he comforted himself by saying: "I am very lucky, February has only twenty-nine days."

Heavy Defeat, Wailing Everywhere

The politicians in Washington and American bourgeois newspapers are even more wailing about the new heavy defeat of the United States in the South Vietnamese battlefield. Russell, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has always advocated continuing the aggression against Vietnam, said in despair that the heavy blows recently dealt to the U.S. aggressors by the South Vietnamese military and civilians are more disappointing to him than any event he has experienced in his thirty-five years as a congressman. He was forced to admit: The United States' "involvement" in South Vietnam is "one of the greatest tragedies in American history." The "Asia expert" of the State Department and former ambassador to Japan, Reischauer, sighed that the situation where the South Vietnamese armed forces are fighting stronger and stronger shows that the United States "obviously" cannot stop a national liberation war, "I think it's time we recognized that." The Washington Post said: "We have the world's most powerful military machine," but we are "tied up by Vietnam, and in fact, defeated." The Christian Science Monitor wrote uneasily that when the news of the South Vietnamese military and civilians' comprehensive offensive victory reached the White House, "that mud pit seems bigger and deeper than ever."

Mutual Accusations, A Dispute

In the midst of panic, a fierce dispute has once again erupted within the American ruling class, and due to the fact that this year is a U.S. presidential election year, the intensity of this dispute is even greater than before. An Associated Press message on the 17th pointed out that although the Johnson administration obviously wants to "limit the debate on the Vietnam War," the result so far has only deepened and intensified the divisions. Politicians from both parties and many bourgeois newspapers have criticized and blamed the Johnson administration, some wanting to investigate the responsibility for the recent defeat, some advocating quick adoption of "remedial measures"; some loudly advocated replacing the defeated commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, while others insisted on demanding a public "debate" with Rusk. Even the official mouthpiece of the U.S. government, the USIS, had to admit: "Now in Washington, there are more and more frictions," and "people are raising unprecedented doubts about Johnson's policy in Vietnam."

After learning the news of the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces' New Year victory, the Democratic Party leader in the U.S. Senate, Mansfield, exclaimed: This attack "has caused a serious situation psychologically and politically," "this shows that the Viet Cong (referring to the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces) are not disappearing, but are active and constantly attacking." He said: "I think we must re-evaluate and assess our military, political, and economic situation there." Another Democratic senator, Morse, said: "The situation in South Vietnam is far from improving, but is deteriorating," and this situation is causing a "national debate" in the United States. Others, such as Nixon and Romney, who are vying for the Republican presidential nomination, as well as Robert Kennedy and McCarthy, who are competing with Johnson for the Democratic presidential nomination, also issued statements, criticizing Johnson's policy of aggression against Vietnam as "ineffective and ambiguous," as a "clear foreign policy mistake," and so on. The Washington Post complained: The Vietnamese people "recently defeated this country of two hundred million people," which fully proves that "we need to change our strategy in Vietnam and remove the person who made the mistake." The Christian Science Monitor admitted that the recent victories achieved by the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces "have overturned (the U.S. attempt to conquer South Vietnam) timetable, today that timetable looks like a dream," "Washington's political goals in Vietnam" today seem more distant from reality than ever before.

Exhausted, No Way Out

Some figures in the American ruling class also expressed serious unease about the Johnson administration's attempt to reverse the situation by further escalating the war. Romney reminded Johnson that a new "escalation" would only "continue the current situation that is unbearable." The former Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Hilsman, when talking about the prospect of the Johnson administration taking the risk of expanding the war to North Vietnam, also warned: "I don't believe that an invasion (of North Vietnam) will work. The invasion will not get us out of the quagmire, but will push us into a bigger quagmire..."

In the midst of the chaos within the American ruling class, the Chicago Sun-Times believes that facing the new heavy defeat in South Vietnam, "if the doves (those who advocate playing the 'peace' card more) have run out of tricks, then the hawks (those who advocate more crazy war expansion) are the same," because the various so-called "alternative measures" they can think of have all been "overturned by the development of the situation." This shows that in the face of the Vietnamese people's continuous victories, no figure in the American ruling class can prescribe an effective remedy to get the United States out of the predicament and reverse the situation. They are all like Johnson, already exhausted and at a loss.

### 南越军民大打胜仗　华盛顿乱成一团  美国统治集团被南越军民新春攻势打得晕头转向丑态毕露

    毛主席说：“在我们的敌人方面，则一切相反。他们是那样腐化，那样充满日益增多的无法解决的内部争吵，那样被人民唾弃而陷于完全的孤立，打了那样多的败仗，因此他们就必不可免地走向灭亡。”
    南越军民大打胜仗　华盛顿乱成一团
    美国统治集团被南越军民新春攻势打得晕头转向丑态毕露
    新华社二十一日讯　本社记者报道：英雄的越南南方军民新春以来接连发动的全面、广泛出击，不仅在南越战场上以“横扫千军如卷席”之势，把美国侵略者及其走狗打得丢盔弃甲，人仰马翻，同时也使美国统治集团内部乱成一团，触发了一场新的越来越激烈的争吵。据报道，近来，美帝头子约翰逊简直成了热锅上的蚂蚁：他一方面日夜提心吊胆地注视着南越战场的形势；另方面，还不得不竭力招架来自美国统治集团内部的种种指责和攻击。路透社报道说：约翰逊最近一直显得“疲惫和紧张”，他的神情反映了他内心的“苦闷和慌乱”。
    热锅蚂蚁　一团惊慌
    南越人民解放武装力量雷霆般地袭击美伪军的隆隆炮声，使太平洋彼岸的美国总统府白宫也受到了猛烈的震动。据报道，在紧张的时候，约翰逊由于心神不定，常常彻夜不眠，有时深更半夜跑到“情况室”去看战况报告。这种反映美军败绩的报告有时一天多达一千多份，但约翰逊还不时要用电话、电报同侵越美军头目联系，焦虑地询问战场形势发展。为了使自己安心，他甚至歇斯底里地责令三军参谋长具结保证坚守已陷入重围的溪山基地。
    与此同时，约翰逊和他手下的军政头目腊斯克、麦克纳马拉之流，接连发表谈话，妄图冲淡越南南方军民所取得的辉煌胜利，安抚人心。但就在这些谈话中，他们也无法完全掩盖他们内心的惶恐。约翰逊惊呼：南越局势“非常严重”；腊斯克哀号：美国在南越正面临一个“困难的局面”；由于侵越失败而被解除国防部长职务、即将在二月底下台的麦克纳马拉，则惶惶然表示，他在“扳着指头数日子”，他自我安慰地说：“我很走运，二月份只有二十九天”。
    惨重失败　一片哀号
    华盛顿的政客和美国资产阶级报刊对美国在南越战场上新的惨重失败更是一片哀鸣。一贯鼓吹坚持侵略越南的参议院军事委员会主席拉塞尔沮丧地说，南方军民最近给美国侵略者的沉重打击，比他担任议员三十五年来所经历的任何事件都更为使他“失望”。他被迫承认：美国“卷入”南越，是美国“历史上最大的悲剧之一”。美国国务院的“亚洲通”、前驻日本大使赖肖尔哀叹，南越人民武装力量越战越强的情况表明，美国“显然”是不能够制止一场民族解放战争的，“我想已经到了我们应当认识这一点的时候了”。《华盛顿邮报》说：“我们拥有世界上最强大的军事机器”，但是却被越南“缠住了，而且，实际上是被击败了。”《基督教科学箴言报》不安地写道，当南方军民全面出击获胜的消息传到白宫时，“（南越）那个泥坑显得比以往任何时候都更大、更深了”。
    相互攻讦　一场争吵
    在惊慌失措之余，美国统治集团内部再次爆发出一场激烈争吵，而且由于今年是美国总统选举年，这场争吵的激烈程度更甚于以往。美联社十七日的一条消息指出，尽管约翰逊政府显然想要“限制关于越南战争的辩论”，但是，“迄今为止的结果只是加深和加剧了分歧”。两党政客和许多资产阶级报刊纷纷对约翰逊政府发出了抱怨和责难，他们有的要追究最近惨败的责任，有的鼓吹赶紧采取“补救措施”；有的大声疾呼，力主撤换侵越败将威斯特摩兰，有的坚持要求同腊斯克进行公开“辩论”。连美国官方喉舌美新处也不得不承认：“现在在华盛顿又出现了愈来愈多的摩擦”，“人们正在对约翰逊在越南采取的政策提出前所未有的疑问”。
    美国参议院民主党头目曼斯菲尔德在得知南越解放武装力量新春大捷的消息后惊呼：这种袭击“在心理上和政治上造成了一种严重局势”，“这表明越共（按指南越解放武装力量）根本不是正在消失，而是活跃和不断出击”。他说：“我认为，我们必须重新估价和估计我们在那里的军事、政治和经济局势。”另一个民主党议员莫尔斯说：“南越局势远远不是在改善，而是正在恶化”，这种局面正在美国引起一场“全国性的辩论”。其他如角逐共和党总统候选人资格的尼克松、罗姆尼，以及正同约翰逊争当民主党总统候选人的罗·肯尼迪、麦卡锡等，也都纷纷发表谈话，指责约翰逊政府的侵越政策是“无效的和含混不清的”，是一个“明显的外交政策错误”，等等。《华盛顿邮报》抱怨说：越南人民“最近使美国这个拥有两亿人口的国家遭到了大败，这完全证明，我们需要改变我们在越南的战略，并撤掉犯错误的人。”《基督教科学箴言报》承认，南越解放武装力量最近所取得的胜利，“已经推翻了（美国企图征服南越的）时间表，今天看来，那个时间表就象一场梦”，“华盛顿在越南的政治目标”，今天显得比以往任何时候都“离现实更为遥远”。
    黔驴技穷　一筹莫展
    美国统治集团的一些人物还对约翰逊政府企图通过进一步扩大战争来挽回败局的作法表示严重不安。罗姆尼提醒约翰逊说，新的“升级”只会“使目前的后果不堪设想的局面继续下去”。前美国国务院远东事务助理国务卿希尔斯曼在谈到约翰逊政府可能铤而走险把战争扩大到越南北方的前景时也警告说：“我不相信入侵（越南北方）能起作用。入侵并不会使我们脱离泥沼，反而会使我们陷入更大的泥沼……”。
    在美国统治集团吵成一团的情况下，《芝加哥太阳时报》认为，面临着在南越的新的惨重失败，“如果说（主张更多地玩弄‘和’的一手的）鸽派已经技穷的话，那么，（鼓吹更疯狂地扩大战争的）鹰派也是一样”，因为他们所能设想到的种种所谓“替代办法”，都已被“事态发展所推翻”。这表明，在英雄的越南人民节节胜利面前，美国统治集团的任何一个人物，都开不出一服有效的药方，使美国得以摆脱困境、挽救败局，他们都同约翰逊一样，已经黔驴技穷一筹莫展。
