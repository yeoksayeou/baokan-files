Fight for the Public and Devote Oneself to the Public

The 8217 unit's first-class hero, Bo Xuejing

The Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense about the broad masses of people having a communist spirit of self-sacrifice is because they "saw that personal interests and immediate interests depend on collective interests and long-term interests." Pfft! What nonsense!

We proletarian revolutionary fighters have our hearts for the "public," our strength for the "public," our blood for the "public," and our lives for the "public." We do not do anything for personal gain.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To die for the people is to die a worthy death." We fight in the high mountains and deep valleys, digging mountains and cutting through cliffs every day. The question of life and death is always before us. Comrades, for the sake of national defense construction, cut steep cliffs, move hanging cliffs, and blast mountains with explosives. We do not seek fame or profit, we do not fear hardship or death, and we are determined to dedicate everything to the great revolutionary cause, always ready to devote ourselves to the public.

Last summer, a rare major flood occurred, and the national defense project faced the danger of being washed away. At this time, we did not hesitate to jump into the raging waters and struggle tenaciously with the flood, saving state property. Deputy Platoon Leader Huang Qingjing and four other comrades sacrificed their lives for the people's interests. The critical moment of life and death is the most severe test for revolutionary fighters. Those who are full of individualism will never make self-sacrifices for the revolution.

We, the engineering troops who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, must firmly establish a communist worldview of wholeheartedly serving the public and the revolution, and bury the revisionist trash of the Chinese Khrushchev deep in the mountains.

    为公战斗  为公献身
    八二一七部队一等功荣立者　柏学经
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说广大群众的共产主义自我牺牲的英雄气概，是因为他们“看到了个人利益和目前利益依存于集体利益和长远利益。”呸！这是胡说八道！
    我们无产阶级革命战士，心为“公”字想，劲为“公”字使，血为“公”字流，身为“公”字献。为私的事我们一点也不干。
    毛主席教导我们：“为人民而死，就是死得其所。”我们奋战在崇山峻岭，天天开山、劈岭，生死问题经常摆在我们面前。同志们为了建设国防，削陡壁，搬悬崖，点炮炸山，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，决心把自己的一切交给伟大的革命事业，时刻准备着为公献身。
    去年夏天，发生了一次罕见的特大山洪，国防工程面临着被冲垮的危险。这时，我们毫不犹豫地跳进激流，和洪水顽强搏斗，保住了国家财产。副连长黄清井等四位同志，为了人民的利益，英勇牺牲。生死关头是对革命战士最严峻的考验，满脑子个人主义的人是决不会为革命自我牺牲的。
    我们无限忠于毛主席的工程兵战士，一定要牢固树立一心为公、一心为革命的共产主义世界观，把中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，埋葬在万重山下。
