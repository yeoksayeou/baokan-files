Around 1961, the chief of the literary and artistic black line, Zhou Yang, was running around everywhere, giving speeches and making comments, singing the praises of "unity" and chanting the "unity" scripture. He talked about how "unity" is the "most important and fundamental task for our country's literary and artistic workers," how "the biggest political issue right now is unity," and how this is a "class need." He spouted endless nonsense.

What kind of "unity" did Zhou Yang want? Whose "class need" did he want to cater to with this unity?

A letter from one of Zhou Yang's accomplices revealed the "secret" behind this "unity" and exposed this dark plot.

After Zhou Yang chanted his "unity" scripture and raised the "unity" banner, the notorious big rightist, the infamous "Madame Sha Fei," Ding Ling, specially wrote a letter to Zhou Yang. In the letter, she expressed her gratitude and wrote: "I feel that my reform is not just because I made mistakes that I need to reform, but also because I can still do many things, I still have a great responsibility to thoroughly reform myself, so I have more confidence. I want to return to you. I feel that I am very close to you. I have had this feeling for a long time, but I was often afraid to say it out loud."

Under the inspiration of Zhou Yang's "unity," this big rightist Ding Ling was full of "confidence" and wanted to "return" to Zhou Yang. This wasn't a clear revelation of the true meaning behind Zhou Yang's so-called "unity"?

Under the call of Zhou Yang's "unity," this big traitor Ding Ling was full of "confidence" and confessed to Zhou Yang that she could still "do many things." This wasn't a clear revelation of what kind of "class need" Zhou Yang's so-called "unity" was?

"Heart to heart, one understands the other." After Zhou Yang extended the "unity" olive branch, those who felt close to Zhou Yang, like "Madame Sha Fei," all understood the implications and were overjoyed. From the Nationalist Party's "youth mentor," Chiang Kai-shek's literary lackey, to the big rightist in the film industry who brazenly attacked the Party; from the notorious traitorous literati, morally corrupt and debauched elements, to the old masters of the "mandarin duck and butterfly" school... They all came out, one after another, "united" under Zhou Yang's black banner, forming a counter-revolutionary special forces unit. They did "many things" for Zhou Yang and his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, to restore capitalism!

This is the meaning of Zhou Yang's "unity" scripture and the "class need."

    斥周扬反革命的“团结”经
    平原
    一九六一年前后，文艺黑线的总头目周扬东奔西窜，作报告、发议论，高唱“团结”调，大念“团结”经。什么“团结”是“我国文艺工作者当前最重要最根本的任务”，什么“当前最大的政治就是团结”，什么这是“阶级的需要”，鬼话连篇，不一而足。
    周扬要的是什么“团结”呢？团结起来适应什么“阶级的需要”呢？
    周扬的一个同伙给他的一封信，点破了这个“奥妙”，揭穿了这个黑幕。
    在周扬念了“团结”经，扯起“团结”旗之后，大右派、臭名昭著的“莎菲女士”丁玲特意给周扬写了一封信，信中感恩戴德地写道：“我感觉到我的改造不只是因为我犯了错误才要改造，并且因为我还可以做许多事，我还有很大的责任才要彻底改造的，因此我更有信心，我要回到你那里来。我觉得我同你很接近。我老早就有这种感觉了，只是常常怕说出来。”
    在周扬的“团结”的鼓舞下，丁玲这个大右派满怀“信心”地要“回到”周扬那里来，这不是一语道破了周扬所谓“团结”的真谛吗？
    在周扬的“团结”的感召下，丁玲这个大叛徒满怀“信心”地向周扬表白她“还可以做许多事”，这不是一语点破了周扬所谓的“阶级的需要”是什么货色吗？
    “心有灵犀一点通。”周扬伸出“团结”的橄榄枝之后，那些和“莎菲女士”一样感到与周扬“很接近”的人，都心领神会，欣喜若狂。从被誉为国民党的“青年导师”的蒋介石御用文人，到猖狂攻击党的电影界的大右派；从臭名远扬的汉奸文人，道德败坏、生活糜烂的坏分子，到鸳鸯蝴蝶派的“老前辈”……一个咬着一个的尾巴钻了出来，“团结”在周扬的黑旗下，组成了一支反革命的别动队，为周扬一伙及其主子中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义做了“许多事”！
    这就是周扬念的“团结”经的“阶级的需要”的含义。
