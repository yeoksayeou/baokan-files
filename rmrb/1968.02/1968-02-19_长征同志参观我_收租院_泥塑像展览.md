	Comrade Long March recently visited the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture and picture exhibition jointly organized by the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, the Vietnam Union of Friendship Organizations, and the Vietnam Fine Arts Association.

	Accompanying the visit were Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Union of Friendship Organizations Phan Hung.

	Comrade Long March carefully viewed the artworks created by Chinese revolutionary artists under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. These works angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the feudal landlord class in exploiting and oppressing peasants in old China, and vividly reflected the fierce class struggle waged by the hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao, to overthrow the brutal rule of the feudal landlord class and seize political power for the people.

    长征同志参观我“收租院”泥塑像展览
    新华社河内十七日电　据这里报纸十七日报道：越南劳动党中央委员会政治局委员、越南国会常务委员会主席长征，最近参观了由越南对外文化联络委员会、越中友协和越南美术协会联合举办的中国“收租院”泥塑像和图片展览。
    陪同参观的有越南对外文化联络委员会副主任范鸿。
    长征同志仔细地观看了中国革命艺术工作者在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下创作的艺术作品。这些作品愤怒地控诉了旧中国农村封建地主阶级残酷剥削和压迫农民的滔天罪恶，深刻地反映了中国亿万农民在以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，为推翻封建地主阶级的残暴统治、把政权夺到人民手中而进行的激烈的阶级斗争。
