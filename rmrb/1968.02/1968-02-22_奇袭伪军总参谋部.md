On the night of January 31, while other units were attacking the U.S. "Embassy" and the puppet "Presidential Palace" in Saigon, a unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Saigon-Cholon area also received orders to swiftly launch a surprise attack on the puppet army's General Staff Headquarters in the heart of Saigon. They caught the enemy off guard, killing many and causing them to flee in disarray. The raid resulted in the annihilation of 815 enemy soldiers and officers, including many colonels and majors. Hundreds of weapons were seized, ten armored vehicles were damaged, ten planes were shot down, and numerous enemy buildings and bunkers were destroyed.

On the night of January 31, a unit of the People's Liberation Army received orders to attack and destroy the puppet army's General Staff Headquarters. The soldiers, filled with joy, set out from their liberated villages. The sky was pitch black, and visibility was zero. Guided by brave and clever self-defense corps members, the soldiers swiftly moved towards their target. Under the cover of the local people, they quickly infiltrated the enemy's stronghold.

Upon receiving the order to attack, the soldiers immediately unleashed precise artillery fire, quickly subduing the enemy and destroying their outposts at the third, fourth, and fifth gates, as well as the machine gun nests mounted on tanks. The soldiers charged into the heart of the enemy's stronghold like a whirlwind, using the bright light from the searchlights to clearly identify their targets and strike them with precision. Various units coordinated perfectly, crossing the fourth gate and suppressing the enemy with fierce firepower. In a short time, the main force of the enemy's company and their ammunition depot were captured. Another unit quickly infiltrated the second gate, seizing the communication center, American barracks, and other key locations. Many American soldiers, who had just jumped out of bed, were struck down by the accurate fire of the liberation army soldiers before they could even grab their guns.

At the same time, another unit of the liberation army attacked the third gate on the north side of the puppet army's General Staff Headquarters, coordinating closely with the first unit to assault the "Joint Military Operations Center," offices, and the helicopter airfield near the puppet army's headquarters. Caught off guard, a large number of defenders were annihilated on the spot, and the remaining enemy fled in panic. The liberation army completely seized the enemy's anti-aircraft artillery positions.

The fifth gate and Vo Tho Street on the south side of the puppet army's General Staff Headquarters, as well as the American special zone, parking lot, and special forces command center, all came under heavy attack from the liberation army. The entire area of the puppet army's General Staff Headquarters was engulfed in flames, and many buildings collapsed. In this way, the liberation army completely controlled the puppet army's General Staff Headquarters. The enemy was caught off guard and in chaos throughout Saigon. It was not until 9 a.m. the next day that they mobilized the 8th Airborne Battalion, supported by numerous armored vehicles, to counterattack in an attempt to retake the puppet army's General Staff Headquarters. The enemy's forces were more than double those of the liberation army, and the liberation army was surrounded by enemy strongholds and outposts, requiring great determination and bravery to defeat the enemy.

The counterattack was fierce. The liberation army soldiers employed flexible tactics, sometimes concentrating their forces, sometimes dispersing, engaging the cowardly enemy in close combat, and killing them in large numbers. Under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy deployed some tanks in an attempt to cut off the liberation army's forces. A liberation army combat team, filled with hatred for the enemy, charged through the gunfire and immediately used a rocket launcher seized from the enemy to destroy three tanks. The remaining enemy tanks were also forced to retreat, daring not to advance another step. The enemy, in disarray, had to change tactics and use helicopters to airlift troops. However, the liberation army quickly used the enemy's anti-aircraft guns to counterattack, shooting down two enemy helicopters.

On February 3, the liberation army still controlled the puppet army's General Staff Headquarters. Only after completing the mission assigned by their superiors did the soldiers withdraw victoriously and return to their base. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    奇袭伪军总参谋部
    一月三十一日夜间，正当其它兄弟单位袭击西贡美国“大使馆”和伪“总统府”的时候，西贡—嘉定区人民解放军某单位，也奉命神速地对位于西贡市中心的南越伪军总参谋部发起突然猛袭，把毫无准备之敌杀得丢盔弃甲，鬼哭狼嚎，一举歼灭美伪军八百一十五名，其中有许多校级、尉级军官，缴获各种武器成百件，击伤装甲车十辆，击落飞机十架，炸毁敌人许多座楼房和碉堡。
    一月三十一日夜间，解放军某单位奉命出击，消灭伪军总参谋部。解放军指战员们从解放区各村庄兴高采烈地踏上征途。这时，天空漆黑一片，伸手不见五指。在勇敢机智的自卫队员的引导下，解放军战士们向着目标飞快前进。战士们在人民群众的掩护下，迅速地插入敌人的巢穴。
    进攻命令一下，解放军战士们立即以无比准确的炮火，迅速地把敌人压倒，摧毁了敌人在三、四、五号门的哨所和架设在坦克上的机枪点。战士们象旋风一样，直冲进敌巢中心区，他们借着探照灯的强烈光芒，看清楚中心区的各个目标狠狠地打。各路战士以绝妙的配合，越过四号门，用猛烈的火力压住敌人。不一会，解放军就占领了敌军主力连驻地和弹药库。接着，解放军的一路队伍迅速插入二号门，占领通讯中心区、美军宿舍等重要场所。许多美军刚刚跳下床，还来不及拿起枪，就被解放军战士准确的火力击倒在地。
    与此同时，另一路解放军也攻进了伪军总参谋部北面的三号门，与前一路队伍紧密配合，攻打美伪“混合行军中心”、办公室和靠近伪军总参谋部机关中心的直升飞机场。由于遭到突然袭击，守敌措手不及，一大部分当场被歼灭，残敌被吓得魂飞魄散，抱头鼠窜。解放军完全占领了敌人的防空高射炮阵地。
    伪军总参谋部南面的五号门和武圣街，以及美军特区、停车场、别动军指挥部等都遭到解放军的猛烈攻击。伪军总参谋部整个区域顿时变成了一片火海，许多座楼房崩塌下来。就这样，解放军完全控制了伪军总参谋部。敌人在整个西贡到处受到突如其来的袭击，乱作一团。直到第二天上午九点钟，它们才出动第八空降营，在许多装甲车掩护下进行反扑，妄图夺回伪军总参谋部。敌人的兵力比解放军多一倍，而解放军又是处在敌人的巢穴里，周围都是敌人的据点和哨所，必须有高度的决心和勇敢的精神，才能战胜敌人。
    反击敌人的战斗进行得十分激烈。解放军战士发挥机动灵活的战略战术，时而聚合、时而散开，同贪生怕死的敌人拚刺刀，把他们杀得尸横遍地，纷纷溃退。在炮兵的掩护下，敌人出动了一些坦克，妄图切断解放军队伍。解放军的一个战斗组怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，冲过枪林弹雨，当即用刚从敌人那里缴获的手提火箭筒击伤坦克三辆。其余的敌人坦克也被打得纷纷后退，不敢前进一步。敌人被打得狼狈不堪，只得改变战术，用直升飞机空投军队。但是，解放军迅速用敌人的高射炮进行反击，一举击落敌人直升飞机两架。
    二月三日，解放军仍然控制着伪军总参谋部，直到完成上级交给的任务之后，战士们才胜利转移，返回根据地。　（据新华社讯）
