	Cherish the Motherland, Look to the World
	Working by the machine, cherish the motherland, look to the world
	Chairman Mao teaches us: Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and dedication to the people is evident in his extreme responsibility towards his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist must learn from him.
		Comrade from Class 2: …
	In the future, when dealing with machine stoppages, I must pay attention to checking the work, strengthening patrols, and especially checking the cotton nets. Otherwise, if a quality accident occurs, it not only causes great waste for the country but is also a crime against the world's people. Today's problem is a good lesson. We must have the world's people as our vast arena, the world revolution as our great faith, and the great ideal that all the world's laboring masses can enjoy the greatest happiness of Mao Zedong Thought. With this, our work will be easier and we will definitely be able to do it well. Today's accident did not happen, which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. … We must remember Chairman Mao's great teachings and use the two "extremes" as a yardstick to examine our thoughts and measure our work, just like Comrade Norman Bethune.

	Let Mao Zedong Thought Shine Globally
	Chairman Mao teaches us: We must seize grain, seize cotton, and seize cloth.
	We fully support and will carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter. We are revolutionary communists, and failing to complete our tasks is our greatest shame. With Chairman Mao backing us, we will definitely make him proud. In the last fifty days of 1967, we must dare to work hard and work tirelessly. We must stand on Tiananmen Gate, look out at the world, and think of the oppressed laboring people around the world living worse than cattle. Every extra inch of yarn we spin supports the world's people and the world revolution. This is our greatest joy and greatest honor. It is also a contribution we should make in propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Only Mao Zedong Thought can save the world. Let the flame of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the globe.

	Our Responsibility, Solving the People's Clothing Problem
	Chairman Mao teaches us: Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous combat (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest).
	Today, I worked almost the equivalent of two people's workload, and although my body feels tired, my mood is pleasant because I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "seizing cloth" and serving the people wholeheartedly, which makes me feel full of energy and more aware of our great responsibility and honor. We are responsible for the clothing needs of millions of people, so we must redouble our efforts to complete the annual production task. Today, I have completed the task according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and I feel happy.

    胸怀祖国  放眼世界
    身在机旁，胸怀祖国，放眼世界
    毛主席教导我们：白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。
      乙班同志：……
    今后我在处理停台时，一定要注意检查工作，加强巡回，特别是注意棉网的检查，否则出了质量事故，不仅给国家造成了很大的浪费，也是对世界人民的犯罪。今天出现的问题就是一个很好的教训。我们要有世界人民这个大天地，要有世界革命这个大信念，要有全世界劳苦大众都能享受到毛泽东思想最大幸福的大理想，这样我们的工作就好办了，就一定能够作好。今天事故没有造成，就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。……要牢记毛主席的伟大教导，一定要象白求恩同志那样，狠用两个“极端”这把尺子检查自己的思想，衡量自己的工作。

      让毛泽东思想普照全球
    毛主席教导我们：必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧。
    对毛主席的指示，我们是一千个拥护，一万个照办。我们是无产阶级革命派，完不成任务是我们最大的耻辱。毛主席，有您老人家给我们撑腰，我们一定为您老人家争气。在大干一九六七年最后五十天中，要勇敢地干，拚命地干。我们要站在天安门，眼望全世界，想到世界上的劳动人民受压迫，过着牛马不如的生活，我们多纺一寸纱，支援世界人民，支援世界革命，这是我们最大的愉快，最大的光荣。这也是我们宣传毛泽东思想所应该贡献的一份力量。只有毛泽东思想才能救世界，让毛泽东思想的光焰照亮全球吧。

  我们的责任，解决人民穿衣问题
    毛主席教导我们：发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。
    今天，我一股劲干了将近两个人的工作量，身体虽然感到疲劳，但是心情舒畅，因为我想起毛主席教导的“必须把布匹抓紧”和全心全意为人民服务，就感到全身有力量，更感到我们责任重大、光荣。我们担负着千千万万人民的穿衣问题，因此，我们要加倍努力完成全年生产任务。今天我已按照毛主席的教导完成了任务，我感到幸福。
