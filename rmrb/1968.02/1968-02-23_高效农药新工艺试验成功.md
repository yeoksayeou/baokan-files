During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers in China's chemical industry, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have, after a year and a half of arduous struggle, successfully experimented with a new process and technology for producing the high-efficiency pesticide 1605 using pentasulfide diphosphorus as the raw material. This has created favorable conditions for China to develop organic phosphorus pesticides more, faster, better, and more economically.

The organic phosphorus pesticide 1605 has a very high insecticidal efficiency, and farmers praise it as "one sweep clean."

Starting in 1966, with the revolutionary workers of the Gezhen Chemical Plant in Wuhan as the main force, together with technical personnel and revolutionary teachers and students from relevant units, a campaign was launched to explore new processes and technologies. In the experiment, they mobilized the masses extensively, carried out technical democracy, and rapidly overcame one difficulty after another. The intermittent production of the chlorination process often discharged a large amount of sulfur, affecting the health of workers, and the chlorination recovery rate was also low, making it a key problem in the production line. The bourgeois "technical authorities" were at a loss on this issue. The more than ten young people responsible for the task of chlorination continuous equipment fought for more than two months and successfully produced a new type of scraper-type thin-film chlorinator, solving this key problem.

    高效农药新工艺试验成功
    在文化大革命中，我国化工部门的革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，经过一年半的艰苦战斗，试验成功用五硫化二磷原料制造一六○五高效农药的新工艺、新技术。为我国更多更快更好更省地发展有机磷农药创造了有利条件。
    一六○五有机磷农药，有很高的杀虫效率，农民称赞它是“一扫光”。
    从一九六六年开始，以武汉市葛店化工厂革命职工为主，会同有关单位的技术人员和革命师生，展开探求新工艺、新技术的会战。在试验中，他们广泛发动群众，开展技术民主，迅速攻克一个个难关。氯化工序的间歇生产，经常排出大量硫磺，影响工人的身体健康，氯化回收率也低，是生产线上的关键问题。资产阶级技术“权威”，在这个问题上束手无策。担当试制氯化连续化设备任务的十几个青年，经过两个多月的奋战，制成新型刮板式薄膜氯化器，解决了这个关键问题。
