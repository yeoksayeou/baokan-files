The ethnic groups in the West of South Vietnam have united as one, with an irresistible force, launching a thunderous offensive against all the cities and strongholds occupied by the American and puppet forces during the New Year. The enemy has been routed in just seven days, with over 15,000 enemy troops annihilated, achieving brilliant results.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation Communication Agency, the recent battle report issued by the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces in the West of South Vietnam states that the ethnic groups in the West of South Vietnam, starting from the dawn of January 30th, launched a simultaneous attack on all enemy strongholds in various battlefields in the West, including the provincial capitals of Ban Mê Thuột, Pleiku, and Kontum, as well as the county seats of Tân Khánh, Lạc Thiện, Phước An, and Bố Hóa.

The report states that in seven days of extremely heroic continuous battles, the ethnic groups have annihilated over 15,000 enemy troops, including 3,100 American invaders. Over a hundred American and puppet troops have been captured, including one American colonel. Seven enemy battalions, ten companies, and almost all puppet police units have been completely annihilated, severely damaged, or disbanded. A large number of weapons and many ammunition depots have been seized. Three provincial puppet government agencies, three puppet military zones, the headquarters of the 24th Special Zone, the headquarters of the 2nd Military Region, and the headquarters of the 23rd Main Force Division, as well as almost all the heads of the puppet military regiment command, have been destroyed, dismantled, or disbanded, causing the enemy's military and administrative command system to be in a state of paralysis. In the attacks on seven enemy airfields, over 300 enemy aircraft have been destroyed or damaged, and many enemy military warehouses and repair shops have been burned down. The 14th, 18th, and 19th strategic highways have been cut off, and all bridges have been blown up, destroying 650 enemy vehicles and blocking all major transportation routes. Four prisons have been destroyed, and thousands of patriotic compatriots imprisoned by the enemy have been rescued.

The report states that the people of various ethnic groups in each city and many villages, in coordination with the offensive of the Liberation Armed Forces, have risen up to smash the enemy's chains of oppression, destroying "strategic hamlets" and concentration camps, eliminating evil elements, and mobilizing thousands of puppet soldiers to surrender to the people. Revolutionary governments have been established in various places, consolidating and expanding the liberated areas.

The report states that the great and comprehensive victory achieved by the ethnic groups and the Liberation Army in the West in seven days has proven the immense power of unity among the ethnic groups in the West, proven the close cooperation between the armed forces and the ethnic groups, and the rapid growth of the Liberation Armed Forces in the West in all aspects.

The report states that this great and comprehensive victory has made the situation in the West more favorable to us and less favorable to the enemy, creating extremely favorable conditions for the military and people of the West to continue to achieve more and greater victories.

The report states that the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces in the West warmly commends the firmness, bravery, wisdom, creativity, and perseverance of all the officers and soldiers of the Liberation Armed Forces in the West. It also warmly commends the tremendous efforts made by the people of various ethnic groups in the base areas to support the frontline. The report also expresses a warm welcome to the compatriots in various cities and their surrounding areas to rise up, closely cooperate with and assist the Liberation Army in various ways, and fight together with the Liberation Army to achieve even more glorious victories.
