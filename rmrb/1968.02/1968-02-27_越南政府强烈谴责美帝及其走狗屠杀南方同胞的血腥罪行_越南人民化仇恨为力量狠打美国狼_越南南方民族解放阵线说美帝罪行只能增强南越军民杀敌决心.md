The Vietnamese government strongly condemns the bloody crimes of American imperialism and its lackeys in massacring fellow countrymen in the South. The Vietnamese people transform their hatred into strength to fiercely strike back at the American wolves. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam says that the crimes of American imperialism can only strengthen the resolve of the military and people of South Vietnam to fight the enemy.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 25: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 25, strongly condemning the bloody crimes of the American aggressors and the Quat-Thieu clique in massacring the people of the cities in South Vietnam.

The statement said that the new revolutionary wave of the people and various patriotic armed forces in South Vietnam is pushing the American aggressors and the Quat-Thieu clique into an extremely difficult situation. A significant portion of the enemy's vital forces has been annihilated, the puppet army is collapsing in large numbers, the puppet regime is crumbling and paralyzed, and the aggressive ambitions of the American bandits have suffered a heavy blow. The military and people of the South have achieved unprecedented victories in the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation in a short period of time.

The statement exposed that the American puppet group used airplanes and artillery to savagely bomb and strafe Saigon, Hue, Da Nang, Ban Me Thuot, and many other towns, and the gangsters carried out mass killings of the people. In Hue, the American aggressors even used napalm, poison gas, bombs, and phosphorus shells to massacre innocent people. The statement pointed out that the aforementioned heinous crimes exposed the extremely brutal nature of the American aggressors and the Quat-Thieu clique. This is the desperate struggle of the aggressors and the traitorous clique who are facing an irredeemable failure.

The statement emphasized that these crimes grossly violated the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnamese question.

The statement went on to point out that the bombs of the United States cannot subdue the Vietnamese people. The more the American aggressors and the Quat-Thieu clique madly create more crimes, the more they arouse the deep hatred of the people of South Vietnam and the entire nation against them. The heroic military and people of the South will surely give them even heavier punishments.

The statement expressed complete support for the statement of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on February 15 this year and the open letter of Le Van Ho, Chairman of the National, Democratic, and Peaceful Alliance of Hue City, on February 18, strongly denouncing to domestic and international public opinion the heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors and their lackeys against the people of various cities in South Vietnam.

The statement appealed to the governments and peoples of all peace-loving and justice-seeking countries to strongly condemn the American aggressors and the Quat-Thieu clique, stop their bloody atrocities against the people of various regions in South Vietnam, and further strengthen their support for the Vietnamese people in all aspects until they achieve complete victory. The statement finally called on all Vietnamese people, with deep hatred for American imperialism and the Quat-Thieu clique, to press forward and resolutely complete the glorious task of defending the North, liberating the South, and ultimately achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam reported that the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently issued a statement strongly condemning the heinous crimes of the American puppet group in savagely bombing the residential areas of Saigon, Hue, and other towns.

The statement said that the American bandits and their lackeys, in a desperate struggle, savagely bombed the densely populated areas of Saigon, Hue, and many other towns. Many houses, schools, temples, and cultural relics were destroyed, and many innocent residents were killed or injured. Moreover, they cruelly persecuted the people, driving many civilians into concentration camps.

The statement pointed out that the more crimes the American bandits and their lackeys commit, the more they arouse the hatred of the people of South Vietnam, and the more resolutely they will carry out the war of resistance against American aggression to achieve complete victory.

    越南南方民族解放阵线说美帝罪行只能增强南越军民杀敌决心
    据新华社河内二十五日电　越南民主共和国政府二十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美国侵略者及其阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团屠杀越南南方城市人民的血腥罪行。
    声明说，越南南方人民和各种爱国武装力量的新的革命高潮正在把美国侵略者及其阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团推向无比困窘的处境。美伪军的一部分重要有生力量被消灭，伪军大片大片地瓦解，伪政权土崩瓦解和陷于瘫痪，美国强盗的侵略野心遭到了沉重的打击。南方军民在一个短时间内取得了越南民族的抗美救国战争的空前胜利。
    声明揭露美伪集团使用飞机、大炮，野蛮轰炸、扫射西贡、顺化、岘港、邦美蜀等许多城镇，恶棍分子大肆屠杀人民。在顺化，美国侵略者甚至使用了凝固汽油弹、毒气、炸弹和磷质炮弹来屠杀无辜人民。声明指出，上述滔天罪行暴露了美国侵略者及其阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团的极为残暴的本质。这是处于无可挽救失败危机中的侵略者和卖国集团所作的绝望挣扎。
    声明强调说，这些罪行粗暴地践踏了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。
    声明接着指出，美国的炸弹绝不能使越南人民屈服。美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团越是疯狂地制造更多的罪行，就越加激起越南南方人民和全国人民对他们的刻骨仇恨。英雄的南方军民必将给他们以更加沉重的惩罚。
    声明表示完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会今年二月十五日的声明和顺化市民族、民主与和平联盟阵线主席黎文好二月十八日的公开信，向国内外舆论强烈控诉美国侵略者及其走狗对越南南方各城市人民犯下的滔天罪行。
    声明呼吁所有爱好和平和主持正义国家的政府和人民，严厉谴责美国侵略者及阮文绍—阮高其集团，制止它们对越南南方各城市地区人民的血腥暴行，并进一步从各方面加强对越南人民的支持，直至取得彻底胜利。声明最后号召全体越南人民，怀着对美帝国主义及阮文绍—阮高其集团的深仇大恨，乘胜前进，坚决完成保卫北方，解放南方，进而和平统一祖国的光荣任务。
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会最近发表声明，强烈谴责美伪集团野蛮轰炸西贡、顺化及其它城镇居民区的滔天罪行。
    声明说，美国强盗及其走狗为了进行垂死挣扎，对西贡、顺化及其它许多城镇的人口稠密地区进行野蛮轰炸，许多住房、学校、寺庙和文化遗迹被摧毁，许多无辜居民被炸死炸伤，不仅如此，他们还疯狂迫害人民，把许多群众赶进集中营。
    声明指出，美国强盗及其走狗犯下的罪行越多，只能更加激起越南南方人民对他们的仇恨，从而更坚决地把抗美救国战争进行到彻底胜利。
