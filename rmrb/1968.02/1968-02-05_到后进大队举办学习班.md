In accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Donghua Commune in Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, organized brigade and production team cadres, militia cadres, and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class in a brigade with a weak work foundation. This strengthened the class feelings between new and old cadres and the poor and lower-middle peasants, and improved relations between cadres and the masses.

When Donghua Commune discussed how to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, there was extensive discussion on where to hold the class. Some suggested holding it at the commune level because the conditions were better, with places to eat and stay, which would facilitate centralized leadership. Others suggested going to brigades with good political conditions to better learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Still, others suggested going to brigades with weaker work foundations to share hardships and learn together with the masses, so that cadres could receive better education. After discussion, it was unanimously decided to go to brigades with weaker work foundations to hold the study class together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. On October 9th of last year, 92 new and old cadres, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, holding high red flags, with precious books in their pockets, beating drums and gongs, and carrying luggage, walked several miles to the revolutionary brigade.

After arriving at the revolutionary brigade, the students stayed and ate in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They worked half a day and studied half a day, and in the evenings, they studied Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The study class used Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, "Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism" as the guideline, and "The Old Five Articles" as a mirror, and took the poor and lower-middle peasants as teachers. After discussing the great situation, they invited a 70-year-old old poor peasant, Gu Chunyou, to speak about his bitter family history. Many students denounced the evil old society. Through digging up the roots of bitterness and thinking of the sweetness of the present, they aroused class feelings and raised class consciousness. They said: In the past, there was bitterness upon bitterness, all because the exploiting class was in power. Now, there is sweetness upon sweetness, all because we have Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the poor and lower-middle peasants are in power. Many cadres expressed their determination to break with selfishness once and for all, to forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, and to hold power for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The original party branch secretary of Xianfeng Brigade, Zhang Songqing, said: "I came with selfish motives, but I will go back with Mao Zedong Thought, forever acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and serving the people with a single heart like Zhang Side." Many students exposed and fought their selfishness in the study class and also did so in the homes of the community members. The students exposed, and the masses helped; the community members exposed, and everyone helped, forming a good political atmosphere where everyone voluntarily revolutionizes, educates themselves, and liberates themselves.

The cadres of the revolutionary brigade also received profound education. Under the influence of the study class, the mother of the fourth team leader, Zhao Changli, told him the family history, urging him to always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and hold the power of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Zhao Changli, through study, realized that the thought of not wanting to be a cadre was wrong, fought against selfishness, and determined to be a good servant of the people. The accountant, Zheng Rong, before participating in the study class, handed over the accounts to the brigade and did not want to work anymore. In the process of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, he made a self-criticism and took the accounts back from the brigade. Under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of the study class, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the revolutionary brigade also changed their spiritual outlook, and more people began to care about the collective and national affairs. The original party branch secretary of Hongwei Brigade, Zhu Qin, said: "The changes in the revolutionary brigade prove that there are no backward masses, only backward leadership. Of all the conditions, the most important is to grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works."

    到后进大队举办学习班
    黑龙江省龙江县东华公社按照毛主席的最新指示，组织大队和生产队干部、民兵干部和革命群众组织负责人，在工作基础较薄弱的革命大队举办毛泽东思想学习班，增强了新老干部同贫下中农的阶级感情，密切了干群关系。
    东华公社在讨论怎样办好毛泽东思想学习班时，对于在什么地方办学习班的问题，曾经进行了充分的讨论。有的人主张在公社里办，因为公社的条件好，吃有吃处，住有住处，便于集中领导；有的人主张到政治条件好的大队去办，可以更好地向贫下中农学习；还有的人主张到工作比较薄弱的队去办，同那里的群众同甘苦，共学习，使干部更好受到教育。经过讨论，一致决定到工作基础较薄弱的大队去和贫下中农一起办学习班。于是在去年十月九日那天，九十二名新老干部抬着毛主席画像，高举红旗，身揣宝书，敲锣打鼓，背着行李，步行十几里，来到了革命大队。
    学员们来到革命大队以后，吃住在贫下中农家里，半天劳动，半天学习，晚上同贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作和最新指示。学习班以毛主席的最新指示为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老五篇”为镜子，并拜贫下中农为师。在讨论了大好形势以后，请了七十多岁的老贫农谷春有讲血泪家史。许多学员纷纷控诉万恶的旧社会。经过挖苦根，思甜源，激发了阶级感情，提高了阶级觉悟。他们说：过去千苦万苦，就苦在剥削阶级掌权，现在千甜万甜，就甜在有毛主席的英明领导，就甜在贫下中农掌了权。许多干部表示，决心同“私”字一刀两断，永远跟着毛主席闹革命，为贫下中农掌好权。先锋大队原党支部书记张松青说：“我是带着私心来的，要带着毛泽东思想回去，永远按照毛主席的指示办事，象张思德那样一个心眼为人民服务。”许多学员在学习班上亮私心，斗私心，到社员家里也亮私斗私。学员亮，群众帮，社员亮，大家帮，形成了人人自觉革命，自己教育自己，自己解放自己的良好政治空气。
    革命大队的干部，也受到了深刻的教育。在学习班的影响下，四队队长赵长礼的母亲给他讲家史，让他永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，掌好贫下中农的印把子。赵长礼经过学习，认识到不愿当干部的思想是错误的，狠斗了私心，决心当好人民的勤务员。会计郑荣，在没参加学习班学习之前，把账交给了大队，不想干了。在斗私批修中，他作了检查，又从大队把账拿回去了。革命大队的贫下中农在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在学习班的带动下，精神面貌也发生了变化，关心集体、关心国家大事的人多了。红卫大队原党支部书记朱勤说：“革命大队的变化证明，只有落后的领导，没有落后的群众，千条万条，抓好学习毛主席著作是第一条。”
