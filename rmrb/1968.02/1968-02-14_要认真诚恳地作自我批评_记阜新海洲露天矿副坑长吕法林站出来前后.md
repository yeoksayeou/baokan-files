In the Fuxin Mining Bureau's Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, there is a cadre. Initially, one mass organization supported and endorsed him, urging him to quickly stand up, while another mass organization did not approve. Later, with an unyielding loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, he studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions earnestly, comparing them point by point and implementing them sentence by sentence. He further corrected his attitude towards the masses, not only standing up quickly but also becoming a leader in both revolution and production.

This person is Lu Falin, the deputy pit manager of the drainage pit.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Lu Falin carried out the bourgeois reactionary line and was sidelined. The two revolutionary mass organizations in the drainage pit, the "Rebel Corps" and the "Revolutionary Alliance," to help him quickly recognize his mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, gave him warm criticism and assistance. Lu Falin also went to both organizations to conduct self-examinations. Soon, his self-examination was approved by the "Revolutionary Alliance." However, the "Rebel Corps" still did not give the "receipt." Lu Falin went to some members of the "Rebel Corps" to seek their opinions, and they said that Lu Falin's self-examination did not go deep enough and that he was not sincere with them. Lu Falin could not understand this at all.

Just at this time, the stationed army in the mine sent Lu Falin to a Mao Zedong Thought study class. He brought this problem with him and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions word by word and sentence by sentence, and studied the "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's teachings on "making self-criticism when one has made mistakes" lit a lamp in his heart. The "Sixteen Points" pointed out: "In fact, as long as they sincerely carry out self-criticism and accept criticism from the masses, they will be forgiven by the Party and the masses." These shining words touched Lu Falin's heart. He thought: Originally, some masses did not "forgive" him because the masses were not satisfied with his self-examination. He recalled the scenes of his self-examinations in both factions. When he examined himself in the "Revolutionary Alliance," he felt that this organization had always supported him, so he dared to reveal everything. However, when he examined himself in the "Rebel Corps," seeing that those who often gave him advice were mostly in this faction, he always had a sense of resentment. Therefore, he was never sincere with the "Rebel Corps." Going to examine himself once or twice was just going to get the "receipt." It was inevitable that the masses did not understand his thoughts and did not approve of him. Thinking of this, Lu Falin realized that the masses did not forgive him because he had not correctly treated the masses and himself.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, with the help of the army comrades, Lu Falin received profound education through recalling bitterness and sweetness. He recalled the hard days in the old society when his family fled from Shandong to Northeast China, and at the age of twelve, he took over the family's burden and went down to the mine. It was Chairman Mao who saved him from the pit of misery; it was Chairman Mao's teachings that cultivated him from an ordinary worker into a Communist Party member and a revolutionary cadre; it was the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao that liberated him from the bourgeois reactionary line. Chairman Mao taught: "If one makes a mistake, one should correct it, and the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." Lu Falin deeply felt that not sincerely listening to Chairman Mao's words and not earnestly acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions was the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. He decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, sincerely examine himself to the masses, reform his worldview, and make new contributions to the people in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After returning from the Mao Zedong Thought study class, Lu Falin first went to the "Rebel Corps," where he had more disagreements and deeper misunderstandings, and said to the leaders of this organization: "I carried out the bourgeois reactionary line in the past and did not sincerely examine myself. I want to re-examine myself and ask comrades to help me recognize and correct my mistakes." Everyone warmly welcomed Lu Falin's change. Lu Falin made a deep self-examination at the meeting, revealing his innermost thoughts, and sincerely listened to everyone's criticism and help. The masses saw that he spoke from the heart, truly recognized his mistakes, and truly drew a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, and said satisfactorily: "You act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and we are at ease."

After Lu Falin sincerely examined himself to both factions of revolutionary masses, he criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of China's Khrushchev together with the masses, corrected his attitude towards the masses with everyone's help, and both factions of revolutionary masses quickly supported him to stand up.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought illuminated Lu Falin's path forward. Now, Lu Falin is active on the front line of both revolution and production with the broad revolutionary masses. Wherever there are workers in the drainage pit, there is Lu Falin's figure. During labor, he implements Chairman Mao's instructions with the workers. In his spare time, he studies and applies Chairman Mao's works with the workers, and together they fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, winning the welcome of the broad masses. Both factions of revolutionary masses say that Lu Falin is right, and we trust him. The revolutionary feelings between cadres and masses are deepening day by day, and the drainage pit presents a new situation of cadres and masses supporting, helping, and promoting each other.

    要认真诚恳地作自我批评
    ——记阜新海洲露天矿副坑长吕法林站出来前后
    沈新
    在阜新矿务局海洲露天矿有一个干部，开始，一个群众组织支持他、拥护他，要求他很快站出来，而另一个群众组织却通不过。后来，他怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心，活学活用毛主席的一系列最新指示，条条对照，句句落实，进一步端正了对待群众的态度，不仅很快站了出来，而且成了抓革命、促生产的带头人。
    这个人就是排水坑副坑长吕法林。
    吕法林在无产阶级文化大革命初期执行了资产阶级反动路线，靠边站了。排水坑的两个革命群众组织“造反团”和“革联”，为了使他尽快地认识错误，早日回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，对他进行了热情的批评和帮助。吕法林也分别到两个组织中去检查。不久，他的检查被“革联”通过了。可是，“造反团”始终不打“收条”。吕法林跑到“造反团”的一些队员家去征求意见，他们说吕法林检查没到“杠”儿，跟他们不是一个心。吕法林怎么也想不通。
    正在这时，驻矿解放军让吕法林到毛泽东思想学习班去参加学习。他带着这个问题，逐字逐句学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，学习毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”。毛主席关于“自己有了错误，要作自我批评”的教导，在他心头拨亮了一盏明灯，“十六条”指出：“实际上，他们只要认真进行自我批评，接受群众批评，是会被党和群众谅解的。”这几行金光闪闪的大字，触到了吕法林的痛处。他想：原来，有些群众所以还不“谅解”自己，是因为群众还不满意自己的检查。他回顾了到两派作检查的情景。到“革联”作检查时，他感到这个组织一向支持自己，就敢揭盖，敢亮底，而到“造反团”中作检查时，看到平时给自己提意见的人多在这一派，心里总有一种反感。所以跟“造反团”始终是见面不见心。一遍二遍去检查，不过是一次又一次去要“收条”。群众对自己思想不摸底，通不过是必然的。想到这里，吕法林认识到群众对自己不谅解，是因为自己还没有正确对待群众，正确对待自己。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，吕法林在解放军同志的帮助下，通过忆苦思甜，受到了深刻的教育。他回忆了在旧社会全家从山东逃到东北，十二岁就顶“号头”下矿的苦难日子。是毛主席把自己从万人坑里救出来；是毛主席的教导，把自己从一个普通的工人培养成共产党员、革命干部；是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把自己从资产阶级反动路线中解放出来。毛主席教导说：“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”吕法林深深感到，不老老实实听毛主席的话，不认认真真地按照毛主席的指示办事，是对毛主席最大的不忠。他决心遵照毛主席的教导，诚恳地向群众作检查，改造自己的世界观，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中为人民立新功。
    吕法林从毛泽东思想学习班回去后，第一步就走进了对他意见多、隔阂深的“造反团”，对这个组织的负责人说：“我过去执行了资产阶级反动路线，没有诚恳检查。我要重新作检查，请同志们帮我认识错误，改正错误。”大家热情欢迎吕法林的转变。吕法林在会上作了深刻的检查，亮出了灵魂深处的活思想，认真听取大家的批评和帮助。群众见他说出了心里话，确实认识到了自己的错误，确实与资产阶级反动路线划清了界限，满意地说：“你照毛主席的教导办事，我们就放心了。”
    吕法林向两派革命群众作了认真的检查以后，同群众一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，在大家帮助下端正了对待群众的态度，两派群众很快就支持他站出来了。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想照亮了吕法林前进的道路。现在，吕法林同广大革命群众一起，活跃在抓革命、促生产的第一线上。哪里有排水坑的工人，哪里就有吕法林的身影。劳动中，他和工人一起贯彻执行毛主席的指示。业余时间，他和工人一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，受到广大群众的欢迎。两派革命群众都说，吕法林做得对，我们信得过。干部和群众的革命感情不断加深，排水坑出现了干部和群众互相支持、互相帮助、互相促进的新气象。　　　（新华社）
