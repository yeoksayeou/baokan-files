Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the workers of Ningxia have achieved revolutionary unity. From February 22 to 28, the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was successfully held in Yinchuan.

The Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the congress. When the telegram was read at the congress, the entire venue erupted in cheers. The representatives shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The day after the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent the telegram, more than ten thousand people from various ethnic groups in Yinchuan held a grand rally to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to express their heartfelt gratitude for the warm care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of Ningxia responded to Chairman Mao's call to "pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Together with the broad revolutionary masses of Ningxia, they launched a resolute struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Ningxia, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They made immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Ningxia, fully demonstrating the role of the main force. Today, in the great march to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, they once again resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism." They established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studied, deeply understood, and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They thoroughly criticized selfishness and established selflessness, eliminated factionalism, strengthened party spirit, and removed interference from the right and the ultra-left. They firmly followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and adhered to Chairman Mao's teachings that "within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions." They took the lead in achieving revolutionary unity, thereby powerfully promoting the rapid development of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination throughout Ningxia.

The responsible comrade of the Lanzhou Military Region and the head of the preparatory committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, Kang Jianmin, spoke at the meeting. He warmly congratulated the opening of the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. He emphasized that the fundamental task of the autonomous region's workers' congress is to arm every worker's mind with Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, so that the workers' movement, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, advances along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. It is necessary to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively, deeply, persistently, and effectively, to turn the autonomous region's workers' congress into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and to build the workers of the entire region into a force that is highly proletarianized and highly combatant, always loyal to Chairman Mao, always loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and always loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He called on the workers of the entire region to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and to strive forward to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

At the congress, the representatives exchanged experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving and consolidating revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and promoting production while carrying out the revolution.

Amidst enthusiastic applause and cheers, the congress passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The congress also passed a resolution, calling on the workers of the entire Ningxia region to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key task, to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to overcome factionalism, to strengthen party spirit, to enhance the revolutionary unity of the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia, to further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity, to achieve the three-in-one combination, to carry out revolutionary criticism and reform within the unit, to promote production while carrying out the revolution, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution in Ningxia. The congress also passed the list of committee members for the workers' congress.

Attending the congress were also the responsible comrades of the Ningxia Military Region, the deputy heads of the preparatory committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Huaili, the responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army's support-left forces in Ningxia, the deputy heads of the preparatory committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, Xu Hongxue, and the deputy heads of the preparatory committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, Wang Zhiqiang, and others.
