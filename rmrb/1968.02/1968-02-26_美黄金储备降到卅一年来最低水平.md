U.S. gold reserves have dropped to their lowest level in 31 years. Due to the deteriorating financial and economic situation in the United States, the dollar's position is increasingly shaky, and the country's gold reserves continue to dwindle. According to an announcement by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the 8th, in the week ending on the 7th, the United States lost $100 million in gold, reducing its total gold reserves to $1,188,400,000, the lowest level in 31 years.

Previously, according to official U.S. figures released on January 31, the United States lost a total of $117,500,000 in gold in 1967, the most significant loss since 1960.

    美黄金储备降到卅一年来最低水平
    由于美国财政经济日益恶化，美元地位风雨飘摇，美国的黄金储备继续大量流失。据纽约联邦储备银行八日宣布，在截至七日为止的一周中，美国流失了黄金一亿美元，使它现有的黄金储备总额只剩下一百一十八亿八千四百万美元，降到了三十一年来的最低水平。
    在这以前，据美国官方一月三十一日公布的数字，美国在一九六七年一年内总共流失黄金达十一亿七千五百万美元，是一九六○年以来流失黄金最多的一年。
