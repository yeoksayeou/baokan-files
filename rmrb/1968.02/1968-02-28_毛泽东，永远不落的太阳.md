Mao Zedong, the sun that dispels the clouds,
The sun that shines with golden light, the sun with boundless radiance,
The eternal sun that never sets and forever shines brightly.
Under his radiant light, the night is about to fade, and the sky is filled with splendid colors.
Radiant sun, illuminating the entire world.
Do you want to hear the hearts of the proletariat of the world beating as one?
Then listen to the resounding call of Mao Zedong that echoes through the clouds:
It embodies the wisdom and essence of humanity,
Reflects the joy of the oppressed people seeing the light of day,
Reveals the dignity of those who rise from the depths of society,
Displays the dazzling beauty of communism.
How can the hearts of the people of the world not be stirred, not be uplifted!
The awareness of the people of the world can only be heightened, their fighting spirit can only be strengthened.
Let the east wind blow strongly! This east wind is the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought.
The east wind rises, the clouds disperse, and the vast sky is filled with light.
The muddy waters are all washed away, and the harmful creatures of the world have nowhere to hide.

    毛泽东，永远不落的太阳
    马里　马马杜·杜库雷
    毛泽东，驱散云雾的太阳，
    金光闪闪的太阳，光焰无际的太阳，
    永远不落、永放光明的太阳。
    在他的光辉照耀下，黑夜即将消逝，长空异彩盛放。
    光辉的太阳啊，普照整个世界上。
    你想听全世界无产者的心在一起跳动吗？
    那你就听听毛泽东的响彻云霄的召唤声：
    集中了人类的智慧和精华，
    反映了被压迫人民重见天日的欢腾，
    揭示了从社会底层翻身的人们的尊严风格，
    展现了共产主义的光彩夺目的美景。
    全世界人民的心怎能不为之振奋，为之昂扬！
    全世界人民的觉悟只能因而提高，斗志只能因而增强。
    让东风劲吹吧！这东风就是光焰无际的毛泽东思想。
    东风起，乌云散，万里长空一片光芒。
    污泥浊水一齐涤荡，人间的害人虫无处躲藏。
