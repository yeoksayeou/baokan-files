In the midst of the nationwide people's enthusiastic response to the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and the triumphant songs of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory!

Guangdong Province is located on the front line of national defense, serving as the southern gateway to our great socialist motherland. The establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee significantly strengthens the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, shatters the capitalist restoration dream of Liu Shaoqi and his accomplice Tao Zhu in Guangdong, and deals another heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. This has great significance for consolidating our national defense, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, developing our socialist cause, supporting the patriotic struggle of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau, and aiding the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation.

We hereby express our highest respect and warmest congratulations to the people of Guangdong Province, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangdong!

Guangdong Province has been the birthplace of numerous anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggles by the Chinese people over the past century. More than forty years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao held the famous Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangzhou and wrote the brilliant Marxist-Leninist works such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," making great contributions to the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao's great revolutionary struggle has always inspired the 40 million revolutionary people of Guangdong. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao has shown great concern for the struggle of the revolutionary masses of Guangdong, providing brilliant instructions at every critical moment. All the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong are great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The process of the victorious development of the Cultural Revolution in Guangdong is a process in which the revolutionary masses of Guangdong, armed with keen and penetrating Mao Zedong Thought, have been in sharp struggle against Tao Zhu and the counter-revolutionary two-faced elements in the style of Tao Zhu. This counter-revolutionary revisionist Tao Zhu, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, has long been promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi in Guangdong. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, he used his agents in Guangdong to disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong, sometimes from the right and sometimes from the "ultra-left." After brutally suppressing the revolutionary masses, they resorted to the tactics of cajolery and bribery, attempting to soften the revolutionary masses, and vigorously spreading anarchist thoughts, stirring up trouble, and trying to shift the direction of the struggle. The cunning and treacherous tactics of the class enemy have brought complexity to the struggle, but they have also greatly tempered the broad revolutionary masses of Guangdong who are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have sharpened their eyes, exposed, and smashed the various tricks and plots of the class enemy. Under the leadership of the working class, after fierce struggles, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong has finally achieved decisive victory.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangdong, steadfast in their loyalty to Chairman Mao, has taken Chairman Mao's instructions as the highest criterion for all actions in this great mass movement. They have emphasized the training classes for cadres to study Mao Zedong Thought, stressing that before any work, one must first deeply study and thoroughly understand each of Chairman Mao's instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts and actions of the cadres. They firmly believe that the masses want revolution, resolutely resist the infiltration of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, seriously implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, enthusiastically propagate and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and patiently do ideological and political work for various revolutionary mass organizations, correctly handling contradictions among the people. They have displayed the fine tradition of modesty and prudence, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, bravely conducting self-criticism. The garrison troops in Guangdong have high-held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, establishing new and great merits in safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and defending the southern part of the motherland.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Counter-revolutionaries are not so clumsy. Their tactics are very cunning and vicious. All revolutionary parties must not underestimate them, must not be complacent, and must greatly raise the political alertness of the people to deal with and eliminate them."

In our celebration of victory, we must never forget that the enemy will not readily accept their defeat. Guangdong Province, located on the front line of the border, has extremely sharp class struggles. The spies of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, Britain, Japan, and the Soviet revisionists, as well as the handful of die-hard capitalist roaders within the party and the ghosts and monsters in society, will undoubtedly continue to engage in sabotage and disruption. The military and civilian people of Guangdong must always remember class struggle, greatly strengthen their awareness of the enemy, be vigilant against the enemy's incitement and use of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist thoughts to split and disperse the proletarian ranks; they must further mobilize the masses to criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, overthrow factionalism, and cut off the black hands. They must resolutely safeguard the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committee, follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, believe in and rely on the masses, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres, further strengthen military-civilian unity, and build an iron wall of the South China Sea.

"Warriors look to South Yue, greener and more lush." Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangdong is in a great situation. We are firmly convinced that the revolutionary people of Guangdong, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will definitely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the letter, summon up their courage, strive to be the best, and continue their efforts to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, allowing the invincible great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought to forever fly high at the southern gateway of the motherland!

    “战士指看南粤，更加郁郁葱葱”
    ——热烈欢呼广东省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在全国人民紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，广东省革命委员会胜利诞生了！
    广东省地处国防前线，是我们伟大社会主义祖国的南大门。广东省革命委员会的成立，大大加强了无产阶级专政的力量，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙陶铸在广东复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦，给了帝、修、反又一个沉重打击。这对巩固我国国防、巩固无产阶级专政、发展我国社会主义事业，对支援港澳同胞的爱国正义斗争、支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，都有着重大的意义。
    我们谨向具有悠久革命斗争光荣传统的广东省人民和驻广东省人民解放军，致以崇高的敬意和最热烈的祝贺！
    广东省是我国人民百余年来多次反帝、反封建革命斗争的策源地。四十多年前，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在广州举办了著名的农民运动讲习所，写出了《中国社会各阶级的分析》等马克思列宁主义的光辉著作，对中国革命作出了伟大的贡献。毛主席的伟大革命斗争实践，始终鼓舞着广东省四千万革命人民。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大领袖毛主席十分关怀广东省无产阶级革命派的斗争，每一个关键时刻都给予光辉的指示。广东省无产阶级文化大革命所取得的一切成就，都是伟大领袖毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    广东省文化大革命胜利发展的过程，是广东省无产阶级革命派运用明察秋毫的毛泽东思想，同陶铸和陶铸式的反革命两面派针锋相对的斗争的过程。陶铸这个反革命修正主义分子，打着红旗反红旗，长期在广东推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。在文化大革命初期，他通过在广东的代理人，时而从右的方面，时而从极“左”方面，破坏广东省的无产阶级文化大革命。他们在疯狂镇压革命群众破产之后，又玩弄笼络利诱手段，妄图软化革命群众，并且极力散布无政府主义思想，挑拨离间，妄图转移斗争大方向。阶级敌人的阴险狡猾，给斗争带来了复杂性，但也极大地锻炼了忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的广大无产阶级革命派。他们擦亮眼睛，识破和粉碎了阶级敌人的种种阴谋诡计。在工人阶级的带头下，经过激烈的斗争，广东省无产阶级文化大革命终于取得了决定性胜利。
    坚定地忠于毛主席的人民解放军驻广东部队，在这场伟大的群众运动中，以毛主席的指示作为一切行动的最高准则。他们狠抓了支左人员学习毛泽东思想的轮训班，强调在工作之前，首先要学深学透毛主席的每一个指示，用毛泽东思想统一支左人员的思想和行动。他们坚信广大群众是要革命的，坚决抵制资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的侵袭，认真执行支左不支派的原则，以满腔热情宣传和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，以极大耐心做好各派革命群众组织的思想政治工作，正确处理人民内部矛盾。他们发扬谦虚谨慎的优良作风，虚心听取群众意见，勇于进行自我批评。广东省驻军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为保卫祖国南方，建立了新的巨大的功勋。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“反革命分子不是那样笨拙的，他们的这些策略，是很狡猾很毒辣的。一切革命党人决不能轻视他们，决不能麻痹大意，必须大大提高人民的政治警惕性，才能对付和肃清他们。”
    在我们欢庆胜利的时候，切切不可忘记敌人绝不会甘心他们的失败。地处边防前沿的广东省，阶级斗争非常尖锐。美、蒋、英、日、苏修特务，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，必然会不断地继续进行破坏和捣乱。广东军民要念念不忘阶级斗争，百倍加强敌情观念，警惕敌人煽动、利用资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思想，分裂和涣散无产阶级队伍；要进一步发动群众批判资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，打倒派性，斩断黑手。要坚决维护革命委员会的革命权威，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数，进一步加强军民团结，筑起钢铁般的南海长城。
    “战士指看南粤，更加郁郁葱葱。”目前，广东省无产阶级文化大革命一片大好形势。我们坚信，具有光荣革命传统的广东省革命人民，一定能够不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在祖国的南大门上永远飘扬！
