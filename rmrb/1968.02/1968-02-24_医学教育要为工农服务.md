Medical Education Must Serve Workers and Peasants

China Medical University old worker Wang Deyu

Chairman Mao personally leads the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has greatly educated me. China's Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism in our country, conspired with the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi to establish this eight-year medical university. The school's educational line is fundamentally opposed to the revolutionary line set by Chairman Mao.

I have worked here as a worker for over forty years. I know very well about the old Peking Union Medical College before liberation and the Medical University after liberation. In my opinion, the Medical University is completely following the old ways of Peking Union Medical College. The old Peking Union Medical College was controlled by reactionary bourgeois intellectuals. After liberation, a handful of capitalist roaders in the party elevated them to the status of "ancestors," allowing them to rule the school. These people are full of bourgeois ideas. The children of our working class and poor peasants are not only discriminated against and attacked by them but also corrupted and poisoned by them. What they instill in the students is the stinking individualist idea of seeking fame and fortune. The Medical University they run has not a trace of proletarian politics. The Medical University only enrolls sixty students a year, and it takes eight years to graduate. If we rely on the Medical University to train doctors, the working people will never see a doctor in their lifetime. Students who come to the Medical University live in high-rise buildings, eat white rice and flour, and do not engage in labor. How can this not produce revisionists? This eight-year system has poisoned countless young people.

Chairman Mao leads us on the path to socialism. The national system has changed, and the educational system must also change. Chairman Mao places the hope of China and the world on the younger generation. Revolutionary youth must become successors who wholeheartedly serve the people. For this purpose, we must overthrow China's Khrushchev and thoroughly reform the Medical University. We must establish a new type of medical education that serves the seven hundred million people, especially the workers, peasants, and soldiers, in accordance with Chairman Mao's educational thoughts. The most important thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, emphasize proletarian politics, and combine with workers and peasants and production labor. This is the path pointed out by Chairman Mao. By doing so, the younger generation can change their worldview and become good revolutionary successors.

Chairman Mao said: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." These words truly strike a chord with us. We revolutionary workers must, together with revolutionary students and revolutionary teachers, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    医学教育要为工农服务
    中国医科大学老工人　王德裕
    毛主席他老人家亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，使我受到很大教育。中国赫鲁晓夫为了在咱中国复辟资本主义，和反革命修正主义分子陆定一合伙，搞了这个八年制的医科大学。这个学校的办学路线和咱毛主席制定的革命路线是根本对立的。
    我在这里当工人四十多年了。解放前的协和，解放后的医大，我都了解得清清楚楚。依我看，医大完全是继承旧协和那一套货色。旧协和是反动的资产阶级知识分子掌权。到了医大，党内一小撮走资派又把他们捧成了“祖师爷”，还是由他们统治学校。这些人满脑子资产阶级思想。咱工人阶级和贫下中农的子弟不但受他们排挤、打击，也受他们的腐蚀和毒害。他们向学生灌输的就是成名成家向上爬的个人主义臭思想。他们搞的医大哪有一点无产阶级的政治气味。医大一年只收六十个学生，一学就是八年，要等医大培养医生，劳动人民一辈子也看不上病。学生来到医大，住高楼，吃白米白面，就是不劳动，这怎么能不出修正主义分子呢？这个八年制学校不知毒害了多少青年。
    毛主席领导咱们走上了社会主义大道。国家制度变了，教育制度也得跟着改变。毛主席把中国的希望，世界的希望都寄托在青年一代身上。革命青年一定要成为全心全意为人民服务的革命接班人，为了这个目的，我们一定要打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，要彻底改革医大。我们要按照毛主席的教育思想，办起为七亿人民服务，特别是为工农兵服务的新型医学教育。最主要的就是要活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，和工农相结合，和生产劳动相结合。这是毛主席他老人家指的路。这样做，青年一代才能改造好世界观，当好革命接班人。
    毛主席说：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”这话真说到咱们心坎上了。我们革命的工人一定要和革命的学生、革命的教员一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
