During China's three years of temporary difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev hurriedly emerged to advocate for the restoration of capitalism, shouting, "The free market must still be pursued, the free market in the countryside will produce some capitalism, produce some bourgeois elements, and produce some nouveau riche. This is not to be feared; do not fear the spread of capitalism."

The master's order was given, and the lackeys responded in unison. In 1962, a class enemy who had infiltrated the party in Xiyouying sold 600 jin of rice at a high price in the free market. At the same time, she used the name of investing in the collective to lend the money from selling rice to the production team at a high interest rate. The following year, she had the brigade repay her in rice at the state price. In this way, she accumulated wealth, becoming a "nouveau riche" within a year. In that very year, this class enemy who had infiltrated the party built the first-class house in Xiyouying with double-glazed windows using the blood and sweat of the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, that year, collective production suffered losses, grain output was not as high as in previous years, the lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants were not as good as in previous years, and Xiyouying saw the re-emergence of polarization!

The Chinese Khrushchev is terrified and hates to see the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, steadfastly walking the socialist path. He is using every means to drag New China back to the old semi-feudal, semi-colonial China. The Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy for "not fearing the spread of capitalism" is an attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside, pushing us poor and lower-middle peasants back into the abyss, making us suffer twice, retrace our steps, and live that miserable life worse than cattle and horses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China." Through the great socialist education movement, we poor and lower-middle peasants have united, repelled the onslaught of the "four freedoms," and seen the black wind. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants look towards the collectivization path, think about the collectivization path, and strive along the collectivization path. Collective strength is growing, public accumulation is increasing, and the lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants are improving. The benefits of Chairman Mao leading us on the collectivization path are innumerable. Honestly, tell you, Chinese Khrushchev, in the socialist new countryside under the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, not an iota of your capitalist freedom will be allowed!

    决不容许有半点资本主义自由
    四七○四部队八连五好战士、班长  焦振海
    在我国三年暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫急忙跳出来鼓吹复辟资本主义，叫嚷“自由市场还是要搞下去的，农村自由市场会产生一些资本主义，产生一些资产阶级分子，产生一些暴发户”，这样“并不可怕，不要怕资本主义泛滥。”
    主子一声令下，娄罗奔走呼应。一九六二年，西右营一个混入党内的阶级异己分子在自由市场上以高价卖了六百斤稻谷，同时，她又以向集体投资为名，转手把卖稻谷的钱以高利借给生产队。第二年她又让大队按国家牌价，把借她的钱折合成稻谷还给她。这样利滚利，一年时间就成了“暴发户”。就在这一年，这个混入党内的阶级异己分子，用贫下中农的血汗盖起了西右营第一流的装有双层玻璃窗的三间新北房。而这年集体生产却受了损失，粮食产量不如往年高，贫下中农生活不如往年好，西右营又出现了两极分化！
    中国赫鲁晓夫对广大贫下中农在毛主席的领导下，坚定不移地走社会主义道路，怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计地要把新中国拉回到半封建半殖民地的旧中国去。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“不要怕资本主义泛滥”，就是妄图在农村复辟资本主义，把我们贫下中农重新推进人间地狱，吃二遍苦，走回头路，过那种牛马不如的悲惨生活。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。经过伟大的社会主义教育运动，我们贫下中农团结起来，打退了“四大自由”这股黑风的袭击。广大贫下中农眼往集体化道路上看，心往集体化道路上想，劲往集体化道路上使。集体力量越来越大，公共积累越来越多，贫下中农的生活越来越好。毛主席领导我们走集体化道路的好处三天三夜也说不完。老实告诉你，中国的赫鲁晓夫，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗照耀下的社会主义新农村，决不允许有你的一星半点的资本主义自由！
