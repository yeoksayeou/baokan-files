In the northern city of Zhangjiakou, the revolutionary workers widely praise the story of "rivals" forming a "red pair."

This "red pair" consists of the original leaders of the two factions in the Zhangjiakou Brick and Tile Factory: Li Yushan from the "United Headquarters" and Wang Jincai from the "Red Alliance."

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Li Yushan and Wang Jincai joined two different mass organizations. Due to factionalism, they became rivals.

	Fighting Factionalism

Last July, the PLA's leftist support team entered the factory to help the leaders of the two factions achieve revolutionary unity. At one meeting, Wang Jincai angrily said, "We cannot unite. Someone said the 'United Headquarters' are dead reactionaries, and you are still preparing for armed struggle with us." Li Yushan said, "Someone said you are monsters and demons, and we are revolutionary leftists. Who would unite with you!" When they mentioned the person, the truth came out. It turned out that both of them had been deceived by a small clique of capitalist roaders and bad elements within the party. The bad elements spoke ill of Wang Jincai in front of Li Yushan and spoke ill of Li Yushan in front of Wang Jincai. This made the two of them unable to distinguish between friends and enemies, while the capitalist roaders and bad elements watched from the sidelines as the tigers fought.

After exposing the tricks of the bad elements, Li Yushan and Wang Jincai were able to sit down and talk. Li Yushan said, "In the past, we were at odds, and it was my fault. We should unite." Wang Jincai said, "We are all class brothers, what is there to fight about. This way of doing things interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and affects the revolution and production."

Although their awareness had improved, when it came to unity, both still wanted to be the core, vying for positions. The PLA's leftist support team repeatedly helped them study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences." Chairman Mao's teachings further enlightened them. Li Yushan said, "Old Wang, if we don't grasp the direction of struggle, fighting internal wars all day, it means we are not ruthless towards the enemy, not strict with ourselves, and not united with our comrades. Factionalism has really harmed us." Wang Jincai said, "At first, I was at odds with you, which was an expression of 'selfishness.' Factionalism serves the bourgeoisie, and we proletarians must uproot it." Li Yushan said, "In the past, I treated you that way because I didn't treat myself as a revolutionary object." From then on, whenever they found factionalism, they fought it. In September of that year, the two major factions in the factory that were once at odds achieved revolutionary unity.

	Forming Pairs

When the Revolutionary Committee of the Brick and Tile Factory was established, Li Yushan was elected as the deputy director, and Wang Jincai was elected as a committee member. To further expose factionalism and consolidate and develop the revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination from the ideological level, the PLA helped the revolutionary masses to widely carry out the "One Helps One, One Red Pair" activity. Those who had great differences and deep estrangements in the two original factions formed "pairs," helping each other politically, ideologically, and technically. Li Yushan and Wang Jincai also formed a "pair." After Li Yushan became the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee, due to his simple work style and careless speech, some comrades reflected that he had a sense of arrogance. Wang Jincai heard this and immediately reported the comrades' opinions to Li Yushan, and together they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Our responsibility is to the people." Once, during a meeting of the Revolutionary Committee to discuss work, some comrades' opinions did not align with Li Yushan's thoughts, so he left the meeting halfway through. Wang Jincai went to his house and had a heart-to-heart talk with him, saying as soon as he entered the door, "Old Li, Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be arrogant and complacent. Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind. We should always remember this truth.' You can't stand criticism and leave the meeting halfway, that's not right!" Li Yushan thought about it and immediately checked his mistake, returning to the meeting.

After this pair of former rivals formed a "red pair," they were praised by the revolutionary masses.

    斗倒派性，“冤家”结成“一对红”
    在塞北山城张家口市的革命工人中，广泛传颂着“冤家对头”结成了“一对红”的故事。
    这“一对红”是张家口砖瓦社原两派革命群众组织的负责人，一个是“联总”的李玉山，另一个是“红联会”的王进才。
    在文化大革命初期，李玉山、王进才参加了两个群众组织，由于派性作怪，结成“冤家对头”。
      斗派性
    去年七月，解放军支左人员进了厂，帮助两派头头协商实现革命大联合。在一次会上，王进才气呼呼地说：“我们不能联合，人家某某说‘联总’是死‘保皇’，你们还要准备和我们搞武斗。”李玉山说：“某某人说你们是牛鬼蛇神，我们是革命左派，谁跟你们联合！”一提起某某人，事实真相大白。原来两人是上了党内一小撮走资派和坏人的当。坏人当着李玉山的面说王进才的坏话，当着王进才又说李玉山的坏话。弄得他们两人敌我不分，而走资派和坏人却在一边坐山观虎斗。
    经过揭穿坏人的阴谋诡计，李玉山和王进才两个人开始能够坐下来谈谈心了。李玉山说：“过去我们闹对立，是我的不对。我们应该联合起来。”王进才说：“我们都是阶级兄弟，有什么可打的。我们这样干，干扰了毛主席的伟大战略部署，影响了抓革命促生产。”
    认识虽然提高了，但是一提到联合，两个人还是都想以“我”为核心，争席位。解放军支左人员，又反复帮助他们学习“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”毛主席的教导进一步启发了他们的觉悟。李玉山说：“老王，咱们不掌握斗争大方向，整天打内战，就是对敌人不狠，对自己不严，对战友不和，派性把我们给害苦了。”王进才说：“我起头和你闹对立，就是‘私’字的表现，派性这东西是为资产阶级服务的，咱工人阶级要把它连根拔掉。”李玉山说：“过去我对你那样，也是由于没有把自己当做革命的对象。”从此，他们俩发现派性就斗。去年九月，这个厂势不两立的两大派实现了革命大联合。
      结对子
    砖瓦社成立革命委员会时，李玉山被选为委员会副主任，王进才被选为委员。为了进一步搞臭派性，从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合和三结合，解放军帮助广大革命群众，广泛开展了“一帮一、一对红”活动。原来两派中分歧大、隔阂深的人结成了“对子”，从政治上、思想上、技术上开展互助。李玉山和王进才也结成了“对子”。李玉山担任革命委员会副主任以后，由于工作方式简单，说话不够注意，有的群众反映他有骄傲情绪。王进才听了以后，就主动地把群众的意见反映给李玉山，同他一起学习毛主席关于“我们的责任，是向人民负责”的教导。有一次，革命委员会开会研究工作，有的同志提出的意见不符合李玉山的想法，他就中途退了场。王进才就找到他家里和他谈心，一进门就说：“老李，毛主席教导我们说：‘即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。’你听不得反面意见，中途退场可不对呀！”李玉山一想很对，就马上检查了自己的错误，又回到了会场。
    这对冤家对头结成了“一对红”以后，受到了广大革命群众的赞扬。
