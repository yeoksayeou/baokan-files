The top echelon of the capitalist-roaders within the Party is the representative of the bourgeoisie. For a long time, China's Khrushchev has stubbornly opposed the great call by our great leader Chairman Mao to focus medical and health services on rural areas. Using the excuse that "only by first improving urban medical and health services can we effectively address the problem of shifting medical services to rural areas," he fundamentally opposes medical and health services for the vast majority of the peasant population. His black hand has reached into the medical education sector, using every means to obstruct students from taking the path of integrating with workers and peasants. The eight-year program at China Medical University has become a typical example of cultivating bourgeois intellectuals who serve only the urban minority. Following the will of China's Khrushchev, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party at the medical university have beautified the theory of "only urban, not rural" as "indirectly serving the five hundred million peasants."

Under the guidance of this "theory," China Medical University's method of training doctors is entirely for urban hospitals. Common and prevalent diseases in rural areas are completely ignored, and there is an emphasis on "high, precise, and advanced" technologies. The techniques students learn can only be applied in large urban hospitals, rendering them useless in rural areas. Moreover, the cumbersome examinations and bourgeois medical practices are not welcomed by the broad masses of peasants. Doctors trained in this manner can only be "laboratory doctors," "X-ray doctors," and "theoretical doctors."

Under the guidance of this "theory," the school emphasizes "academic education first" and "foreign languages above all," suppressing proletarian politics at every turn, causing students to become increasingly detached from the three great revolutionary movements, allowing bourgeois intellectuals to corrupt the youth, and cultivating revisionist seeds.

Under the guidance of this "theory," graduates of China Medical University have never been assigned to rural areas. Revolutionary students who propose to go to rural areas to serve the five hundred million peasants are slandered as having "no ideals." They even say, "We trained you for eight years, is it for you to go to the countryside?" Not only that, but they also force students to study the black "Self-Cultivation" multiple times, using every means to make students detach from the broad laboring masses who raised them.

In essence, the "indirectly serving the five hundred million peasants" theory is the "directly serving the bourgeoisie" theory; the "urban first, rural later" theory is the theory of not serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Under this revisionist banner, they attempt to raise a group of bourgeois spiritual aristocrats to serve the capitalist restoration in China by the top echelon of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Let the "indirect service" theory go to hell! We are determined to go to the countryside for the long term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    把医疗卫生的重点放到农村去
    中国医科大学四年级教学连队
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是资产阶级的总代表。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫顽固地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的把医疗卫生工作重点放到农村去的伟大号召，以先搞好“城市医疗卫生工作”才能“很好地解决卫生工作转向农村的问题”为借口，从骨子里反对医疗卫生工作为占全国人口绝大多数的农民服务。他的黑手伸到医学教育界，千方百计地阻挠学生走和工农相结合的道路。八年制的中国医科大学，成了培养专为城市里少数人服务的资产阶级知识分子的典型。秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，医大党内一小撮走资派把这种只要城市不要农村的理论，美化为“间接为五亿农民服务”。
    在这种“理论”指导下，中国医大培养医生的方法完全是为了城市的大医院。对于农村中的常见病、多发病根本不予理睬，一味追求“高精尖”。学生所学的那一套技术只能在大城市的大医院应用，到农村就无能为力。而且，烦琐的检查，资产阶级的医疗作风，广大农民根本不欢迎。这样培养出来的医生，只能是“实验室”医生，“爱克斯光片”医生，“理论”医生。
    就在这种“理论”指导下，学校大搞“智育第一”，“外文至上”，处处排斥无产阶级政治，使学生远远脱离三大革命运动，让资产阶级知识分子任意腐蚀青年，把学生培养成修正主义苗子。
    就在这种“理论”指导下，中国医大历届毕业生没有一个分配在农村。革命同学提出要下农村为五亿农民服务，学校党内一小撮走资派就诬蔑是“没有理想”，并且还说：“培养你们八年，难道是为了你们下农村？”不但如此，还硬要学生学习几遍黑《修养》，千方百计使学生脱离养育他们的广大劳动人民。
    归根结底，“间接为五亿农民服务”论，实质是“直接为资产阶级服务”论；“先城市后农村”论，就是不要为贫下中农服务。他们打着这一修正主义旗号，企图豢养一批资产阶级精神贵族，为党内最大的一小撮走资派在中国复辟资本主义服务。
    毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”让“间接服务”论见鬼去吧！我们决心长期地、无条件地、全心全意地到农村去，“完全”“彻底”地为广大贫下中农服务。
