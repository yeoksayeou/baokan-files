The editorial board of the *Liberation Army Daily* writes: With deep respect, we introduce to you the deeds of Comrade Wang Shuqing, a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Comrade Wang Shuqing loves the great leader Chairman Mao the most and listens to Chairman Mao the most. He is filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, and with his eyes on the world, he made this vow: "Human liberation, my liberation—I will dedicate my life to the people." Comrade Wang Shuqing kept his word. He treated the communication lines he maintained as a battlefield to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to rescue his comrades, he sacrificed his young life. Comrade Wang Shuqing's "death for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai," and he truly deserves to be called a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Comrade Wang Shuqing's lofty ideals and noble qualities are the result of being nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong. He studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" diligently, understanding each word and sentence carefully, checking himself against each word and sentence, turning each word and sentence into his soul, and putting each word and sentence into action. He shines with the revolutionary spirit of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Yellow Mountains, setting an example of thought reform for us.

Comrade Wang Shuqing's brilliant deeds once again tell us: To be a good soldier who is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, one must definitely learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out thought reform. The characters "loyalty" and "application" are inseparable. Without "application," "loyalty" becomes empty talk. In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must, like Comrade Wang Shuqing, with the greatest self-awareness, the highest standards, and the strictest requirements, use Mao Zedong Thought to break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and become good soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Just as the people of the entire nation are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advancing victoriously in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great communist warrior—Wang Shuqing—has emerged in a remote valley in the western foothills of Changbai Mountain.

Wang Shuqing is the squad leader of a line maintenance team in the Communications Corps of the Shenyang Military Region. He has been away from his leaders for many years, leading two soldiers to maintain national defense communication lines under harsh conditions. He armed his mind with the great thought of Mao Zedong. In the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in his daily mundane work, he showed boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the end, he sacrificed his young life to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to rescue his comrades.

Comrades praise him for forging a selfless red heart with the brilliant ideas of the "Three Constantly Read Articles."

The leaders of the unit commend him: "Although he has been in the army for a short time, he truly serves the people, and he is our teacher."

The masses praise him as a new communist nurtured by the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and his spirit embodies that of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Yellow Mountains.

At the current meeting of the active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the People's Liberation Army Shenyang Military Region and the Communications Corps, representatives from Wang Shuqing's former unit introduced his brilliant deeds with deep emotion.

Reading Chairman Mao's books is the greatest happiness

In March 1964, Wang Shuqing enlisted in the army during the nationwide wave of learning from the People's Liberation Army. In the new soldier training team, his first question to the leadership was how to study Chairman Mao's works. He wrote down the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, "Study Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, apply them actively, integrate learning with application, learn what is urgently needed first, and see results immediately," neatly in his diary and deeply in his heart. Once, after pulling coal ash with his comrades all day, he was still engrossed in studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" under the lamp late at night. The squad leader called him to rest early, but he said, "I haven't done the biggest thing of the day yet, so I can't sleep." The squad leader asked him, "What big thing haven't you done yet?" Wang Shuqing pointed to the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* on the table and said, "Today's plan to study Chairman Mao's works hasn't been completed yet!"

Wang Shuqing had a red sun in his heart, and he loved reading Chairman Mao's books the most. When the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing tried to use the black book *On Cultivation* by the Chinese Khrushchev as the teaching material for party classes, Wang Shuqing wrote in his diary: "I feel that Chairman Mao's works are the party's policies, and the teaching material for party classes. Party members must study Chairman Mao's works to be good party members!" He said passionately, "Thousands of books, tens of thousands of books, the best book is Chairman Mao's book. Growing up in a new society, this is happiness, that is happiness, the greatest happiness is reading Chairman Mao's books."

Chairman Mao's books are the treasure of the revolution, but before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they were not easy to buy. Once, Wang Shuqing went to the New China Bookstore to buy *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, and the salesperson asked him, "Do you have a ticket?" Wang Shuqing was surprised, why did he need a ticket to buy Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasure? It was during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that he understood that this was the heinous crime of the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen in their frenzied opposition to Mao Zedong Thought. They opened the green light for the publication of various poisonous weeds, but restricted the revolutionary masses from obtaining the revolutionary treasure of Chairman Mao's works. Wang Shuqing was very angry. He said, "Without Chairman Mao, there would be nothing for the people; without Mao Zedong Thought, we could not march towards communism. The more the enemy opposes our study of Chairman Mao's works, the more we must study."

To buy the revolutionary treasure that did not require a ticket, Wang Shuqing went to the New China Bookstore every few days. Once, the bookstore happened to have a batch of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* that did not require a ticket. People heard the news and surged towards the bookstore like a tide. Wang Shuqing's position in the queue was relatively forward, and he could definitely buy it. However, seeing the countless red hearts yearning for the red sun, he was extremely joyful and voluntarily let those who came later in front of him. By the time he reached the bookcase, this batch of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* had been sold out. The salesperson asked him in puzzlement, "You've run around so many times, and today there are books, why do you keep letting others go?" Wang Shuqing smiled and said, "Everyone needs Mao Zedong Thought, I'm in a hurry, and they're in a hurry too! This time I didn't get it, I'll come again next time."

The salesperson, looking at this soldier of the Liberation Army who loved Chairman Mao infinitely, was deeply moved by his simple and sincere words. When Wang Shuqing came to the New China Bookstore for the seventh time, he finally bought a set of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* he had been longing for with the help of this enthusiastic salesperson. He took the shining revolutionary treasure with both hands, opened the first volume, and gazed at the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait with tears in his eyes, as if he was silently swearing to Chairman Mao: Dear Chairman Mao! I have been longing for your revolutionary treasure day and night, and today I finally got it. I will definitely read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. I will forever be your good soldier.

Wang Shuqing usually did not spend money casually. He used most of the allowance he saved to buy Chairman Mao's portraits and works, giving them to relatives, comrades, and poor peasants, so that everyone could arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Once, when he went to the bookstore to buy the second volume of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, he saw a person who looked like a village cadre next to him holding the second volume, muttering to himself, "Great, I just need this second volume." But this comrade patted his pocket and found that he didn't have enough money, so he had to put the book down reluctantly and walk out of the bookstore. Wang Shuqing saw this and quickly said to the salesperson, "Quick, another second volume." He took the revolutionary treasure and chased out the door, giving it to the stranger. Another time, he bought dozens of "Three Constantly Read Articles," and as soon as he went out the door, he gave them one by one to a group of Little Red Guards. Someone asked him, "Do you know them?" Wang Shuqing replied honestly, "No, but they are the successors of the revolution and need Mao Zedong Thought!"

Connecting thoughts, words, and deeds with the red line of Mao Zedong Thought

Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the intimate comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, instructed us: "We should study the 'Three Constantly Read Articles' as a motto. Every level should study. After studying, we must apply it and carry out thought reform."

Wang Shuqing did exactly as Vice Chairman Lin instructed. He carried forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao himself, studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with each word and sentence carefully understood, each word and sentence checked against himself, and each word and sentence put into action. His tens of thousands of words of diary entries are all records of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to transform his worldview. One-third of them are notes on repeatedly studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles." He always required himself that his thoughts, words, and deeds must be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and his thoughts, words, and deeds must be connected with the red line of Mao Zedong Thought.

After enlisting, Wang Shuqing was rated as an excellent soldier in his first year and was honored to join the Communist Party of China in his second year. However, he did not relax his strict self-requirements. When he discovered that there was a selfish "honor" and "future" in his mind, he used the sharp weapon of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" to dig it out. He severely questioned himself: "Working for personal honor and fame, what is the meaning of that? That is so shameful! If this thought develops, isn't it the path of being lighter than a feather? The more selfishness, the farther from Mao Zedong Thought." To forever follow Chairman Mao and realize the lofty ideal of liberating all humanity, he strictly required himself to connect his thoughts, words, and deeds into one line to achieve one goal—to follow Chairman Mao and liberate all humanity. He deeply understood that to follow Chairman Mao and use Mao Zedong Thought to liberate all humanity, one must first use Mao Zedong Thought to liberate one's own soul. On the door of the inner room of the squad, under the shining portrait of Chairman Mao, he wrote in large characters: "Break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, eliminate bourgeois thoughts and promote proletarian thoughts." He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, walked the path of breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, and fought a battle of thought reform in the depths of his soul.

Wang Shuqing's squad was stationed in a small thatched house in a village in the western foothills of Changbai Mountain. To maintain the national defense communication lines, they had to cross more than thirty mountain ridges and traverse more than ten marshes. Some sections could not be passed through, so they had to take detours. This way, the time for each line inspection became longer. To change the natural environment of the entire line and be able to eliminate line faults in time, he and the two comrades in the squad decided to build ladders on the steep slopes and build bridges over the marshes. They went out early and returned late, had only two meals a day, and with shovels and pickaxes, axes and saws, they worked hard to build very neat ladder-like steps on two mountain slopes. However, a heavy rain washed them all away.

When work encountered difficulties, selfishness could easily sneak in. After the ladders were washed away by the rain, Wang Shuqing had a conflict in his mind: should he continue to build or not? Through studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," he overcame selfishness and gained a new understanding: "Although we have become soldiers and wear yellow uniforms, it does not mean that each of us has joined the ranks of those who serve the people wholeheartedly. The Zhang Zedong comrade that Chairman Mao talked about is a comrade in our ranks, saying that Zhang Zedong has joined the ranks of those who serve the people 'completely' and 'thoroughly.'"

To truly join the ranks of those who serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly" in thought, Wang Shuqing laid out the battlefield of self-criticism in the depths of his soul, and let the shining images of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Yellow Mountains always accompany him in his struggle. In the summer, he and his comrades endured the scorching sun, the stifling heat in the bushes, and the biting of mosquitoes and flies, working tirelessly with bare chests; in the winter, he led his comrades to face the wind and snow, carrying the wood they chopped from the mountains, one by one, to the marshes covered with deep snow, and built wooden bridges there.

After a year of hard work, Wang Shuqing and his comrades, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, not only built more than 2,100 ladders in the mountains and built more than ten bridges over the marshes, opening a path for line inspection and greatly shortening the time for line maintenance; more importantly, they built a path of breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, realizing thought reform in their minds.

Wang Shuqing was rated as an excellent soldier for three consecutive years and was selected as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the unit. His squad also became an advanced squad. But he was never proud or complacent, always striving for new progress. He said, "Those who aim for the peak will never stop halfway." Once, the leadership asked him with concern, "Does your squad have any problems?" He did not answer immediately. Later, he took this "no problem" as a problem and asked himself many questions in light of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Have I done all my work? Have I overcome selfishness? Have I helped those who have not been rated as four-excellents and those who have not been rated as five-excellents? What are their thoughts and work situations?" He compared himself with "completely," "thoroughly," and "two extremes," and found his shortcomings. He said, "Not seeing shortcomings is the biggest shortcoming, and not finding the gap means no progress!" He often used such words to encourage himself:

Thought reform is like the Long March,
Every step forward is a struggle.
The Long March has thousands of mountains and rivers and the enemy's obstruction,
Thought reform has the struggle between public and private, individual and collective.
The Long March requires blood,
Thought reform must penetrate the soul.

He thus actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, fought unceasingly, and reformed unceasingly, striding towards the new realm of thought reform.

Forever a Red Defender of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

Wang Shuqing was an excellent line maintenance soldier, but more importantly, he was a red defender of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

As soon as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, began, Wang Shuqing, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, immediately joined the battle from the mountain village. He used his pen as a weapon and started from criticizing the "Three Families Village." Someone said, "Our level is low, and we can't write good criticism articles." Wang Shuqing said, "This is not a matter of level, but of attitude. This is a battle to defend Mao Zedong Thought!"

When he heard that the Chinese Khrushchev advocated the fallacy of "exploitation has merit," he was so angry that his lungs almost burst. To thoroughly criticize this counter-revolutionary fallacy, he led the soldier Kang Liande to the home of the old poor peasant Wang Kuixu, asking the old man to use his personal experience to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev with them. Old peasant Wang Kuixu, this old poor peasant who had drunk bitter water in the old society, how could he tolerate the Chinese Khrushchev turning back the wheels of time! He angrily denounced the old society and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev, repeatedly instructing his soldiers to defend Chairman Mao and resolutely overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev.

The two soldiers returned to the squad, and their emotions were not calm for a long time. They faced each other and recalled their family histories. Wang Shuqing thought of his grandfather being killed by the landlord colluding with bandits, and his uncle and elder brother being taken as laborers by the Japanese invaders and dying miserably in a foreign land, and he was filled with grief and indignation. He said, "We must never forget the past, forgetting the past is betrayal! The Chinese Khrushchev says 'exploitation has merit,' this is pure nonsense! We must shout loudly: Exploitation is a crime! It deserves to die ten thousand times!"

Wang Shuqing looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao and felt that he had many words to say to Chairman Mao. He excitedly said to Kang Liande, "Come, let's swear to Chairman Mao!" In the thatched hut, the two soldiers stood in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao and raised their fists: "Chairman Mao! We are your soldiers, we will defend you with our blood and lives, and we will fight to the end with anyone who opposes you!"

Although Wang Shuqing did not undertake the "Three Supports and Two Militaries" work during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he regarded defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as his duty. He was filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the class enemy, thinking about a question: How should a soldier like me, who lives in a mountain valley and is on solitary duty, contribute to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? His answer was: Not only should I firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, but I should also let my relatives, my comrades, and all the masses I can come into contact with firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The letters Wang Shuqing sent home were all leaflets propagating Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When his brother, who was an accountant in the production team, was invaded by the counter-revolutionary economic wind; when his fiancée, who was studying in school, was deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, Wang Shuqing always sent the voice of Chairman Mao to their hearts in time, helping them expose the plots of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Wang Shuqing's company was scattered over a long line. He used the telephone, letters, and the opportunity for the company to concentrate on training to talk with more than 80% of the comrades in the company. Every time, he would ask his comrades about the problems they and their families encountered during the Cultural Revolution. Once, he learned from the telephone that his comrade Sun Wanhe's brother, who was a cadre in the countryside, had been posted with big-character posters and had some doubts. Wang Shuqing first studied a passage of Chairman Mao's quotations with Sun Wanhe on the phone: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the party, these are two fundamental principles. If you doubt these two principles, then you can't do anything." He encouraged him to help his brother study Chairman Mao's works and undergo the test of the mass movement. Sun Wanhe wrote several letters to his brother. Later, his brother wrote back saying: The masses had helped him a lot, and now he had been elected as a cadre by the masses, and he also said he had received the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* sent by him, and he would definitely study hard in the future. Sun Wanhe was very surprised, who sent the book to his brother? It turned out to be Wang Shuqing!

The east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution inspired the poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountain village to revolutionize enthusiastically. Wang Shuqing was always with the masses, fighting shoulder to shoulder. He helped the revolutionary masses keep the spearhead of the struggle always aimed at the real enemy. When the poor and lower-middle peasants fought against the illegal landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, he enthusiastically encouraged the masses: "Everyone should be mobilized to fight deeply and thoroughly." The poor and lower-middle peasants happily said: "Comrade Wang always supports us!"

The masses in the mountain village were mobilized. They took power from the hands of the landlord elements and elected a poor peasant as the accountant. That poor peasant was afraid he couldn't do it well and didn't dare to take it. Wang Shuqing knew about it and went to his door several times to do ideological work, studying *In Memory of Norman Bethune* with him. Wang Shuqing said, we poor and lower-middle peasants should have revolutionary aspirations, if we don't do it, can we let the landlords do it? As long as we have a red heart to hold power for the people, we will definitely do it well!

In the storm of class struggle, Wang Shuqing deeply understood that one more person mastering Mao Zedong Thought meant one more revolutionary force. Therefore, wherever he went, he mobilized the masses to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, spreading the brilliant ideas of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" wherever he went. Once, he went out on business and stayed in an inn. Seeing that the guests came from all directions and had nothing to do in the evening, it was a good opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. So, he and his comrades sang the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, gathered the guests, and propagated the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to everyone, talked about the importance of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's quotations, and organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations together, which gave the guests and the inn staff a great education and enlightenment. From then on, this inn established the practice of organizing guests to study Chairman Mao's works. In the station, Wang Shuqing was even more active in propagating Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the superiors, he and his comrades set up a class for studying Chairman Mao's works with the participation of militiamen, promoting the development of the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works in the village. Mao Zedong Thought unified the thoughts of all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village, the world of "public-mindedness" expanded, and the territory of "selfishness" shrank. Everyone had one heart and one step, firmly walking on the bright road of socialism. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised Wang Shuqing, saying: "He is truly on the front line of defending Chairman Mao. If everyone is like him, our proletarian state will be as strong as iron and steel!"

"Human liberation, my liberation—I will dedicate my life to the people"

In 1967, on May 1, International Labor Day, the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines came.

Wang Shuqing, who had been fighting day and night in the deep mountains and dense forests to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, saw the great situation of "millions of workers and peasants enthusiastically participating" and thought of the revolutionary masses in the capital who would once again be inspected by the most respected great leader Chairman Mao and his intimate comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and his heart was filled with excitement. Early in the morning, he set out with Kang Liande to perform the duty of combat readiness and line maintenance.

They came to the bank of the Dangshi River. Heavy rain had caused the river to rise rapidly, and a dam made of loose stones had been swallowed by the surging waters, blocking their way.

Wang Shuqing stood on the riverbank, looking at the communication lines stretching into the distance on the opposite bank. This was a red line connecting Beijing and the border of the motherland, a red line transmitting the voices of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee! In bad weather, the lines were most prone to faults, and the class struggle was so intense that the enemy might also take the opportunity to sabotage. To ensure the smooth flow of the lines, Wang Shuqing decided resolutely: "Wade across the river!"

On the riverbank, Wang Shuqing and Kang Liande opened the shining *Quotations from Chairman Mao*. This was the seventh time they had studied Chairman Mao's quotations since they set out today. Facing the roaring river, Wang Shuqing and Kang Liande read aloud:

"Resolutely carry out the decision, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

They moved forward in the waist-deep surging waters, each step was very difficult. Suddenly, a dangerous situation occurred, Kang Liande was about to be washed down the dam. Wang Shuqing completely forgot his own safety, shouting loudly, "Kang Liande, lean up!" and quickly rushed towards Kang Liande. At this moment, a fierce mountain flood surged down, and the two soldiers fell into the water.

Kang Liande was washed to the river bend and grabbed a fallen tree. He anxiously called out, "Com—mand—er! Com—mand—er!"

Instantly, the villagers in the fields dropped their plows, the women dropped their children, and the students put down their books, and people from all directions rushed to the riverbank. Several hundred people gathered on the riverbank. The young and strong who knew how to swim jumped into the Dangshi River one after another. The old, women, and children ran back and forth on the bank, calling out, "Comrade Wang! Comrade Wang! Com—mand—er Wang!"

Wang Shuqing could no longer answer the calls of his loved ones. He sacrificed his young life gloriously to defend Chairman Mao, to defend national defense, and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The sad news spread, and tens of thousands of workers, peasants, soldiers of the Liberation Army, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres, braving the wind and rain, enduring the scorching heat, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, came from all directions to the martyr's tomb, learning from the martyr's revolutionary spirit and expressing their condolences. In the new battle of criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism, parents instructed their children, and young people encouraged each other: Be like Wang Shuqing, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and be a new communist nurtured by the "Three Constantly Read Articles."

Now, the brilliant deeds of Chairman Mao's good soldier Wang Shuqing have spread throughout the large and small villages in the foothills of Changbai Mountain and many cities, towns, and military camps in northeastern China. A poor peasant brought his son and daughter who could sing and play instruments, and the whole family joined the propaganda team of Wang Shuqing's deeds. The song composed from Wang Shuqing's posthumous poem is being spread to all directions:

Raise the red flag and march forward, forever revolutionary and never forget the roots.
Remembering bitterness and sweetness increases our efforts, learn from the martyrs for the people.
A lifetime of revolutionary aspirations, thinking of the suffering people in the world.
Human liberation, my liberation—I will dedicate my life to the people.

    人类解放我解放，我愿一生为人民
    ——记毛主席的好战士王树庆
    《解放军报》编者按：我们怀着崇敬的心情，向大家介绍毛主席的好战士王树庆同志的事迹。
    王树庆同志最热爱伟大领袖毛主席，最听伟大领袖毛主席的话。他满怀对毛主席的无限忠诚，放眼世界，立下了这样的誓言：“人类解放我解放，我愿一生为人民。”王树庆同志说到做到，他把自己维护的通信线路，当作保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战斗岗位，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为了抢救战友而献出了年轻的生命。王树庆同志“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”，不愧为毛主席的好战士。
    王树庆同志的崇高理想和高贵品质，是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果。他刻苦地活学活用“老三篇”，一字一句认真领会，一字一句对照检查，一字一句化为灵魂，一字一句落实行动，全身闪耀着张思德、白求恩、老愚公的革命精神，为我们树立了思想革命化的好榜样。
    王树庆同志的光辉事迹又一次告诉我们：要做一个无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的好战士，对毛泽东思想就一定要学了就用，搞好思想革命化。一个“忠”字，一个“用”字，是分不开的。离开“用”字，“忠”就成为空话。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，我们要象王树庆同志那样，以最大的自觉，最高的标准，最严的要求，用毛泽东思想破私立公，做无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的好战士。
    正当全国亿万人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中胜利前进的时候，长白山西麓偏僻的山沟里，又出现了一个伟大的共产主义战士——王树庆。
    王树庆是沈阳部队通信兵某部线路维护小组的班长。他常年远离领导，带领两名战士，在艰苦的条件下，维护着国防通信线路。他用伟大的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，在无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨里，在日常的平凡工作中，处处表现了对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想、对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚。最后，他为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为抢救战友，献出了自己年轻的生命。
    战友们赞扬他用“老三篇”的光辉思想，铸就了一颗“人类解放我解放”的无私的红心。
    部队的领导同志夸奖他：“当兵时间虽短，讲为人民服务，他是我们的老师。”
    人民群众称赞他是“老三篇”哺育出来的共产主义新人，他身上处处体现着张思德、白求恩、老愚公的精神。
    在正在举行的人民解放军沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会和通信兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会上，王树庆生前所在单位的代表，怀着激动的心情，向大家介绍了王树庆烈士生前的光辉事迹。
    读毛主席的书是最大的幸福
    一九六四年三月，王树庆在全国人民学习人民解放军的热潮中入伍了。在新兵集训队，他向领导上提出的第一个问题，就是应当怎样学习毛主席著作。他把林彪副主席“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的指示，工工整整地写在日记本上，也是一字一句地刻在自己的心坎上。一次，他和战友拉了一天炉灰，深夜还在灯光下聚精会神地学习《为人民服务》，查铺的队长叫他早点休息，他说：“我今天最大的事还没有做好，睡不着。”队长问他：“还有什么大事没有做好？”王树庆指着桌上的《毛泽东著作选读》说：“今天学习毛主席著作的计划还没有完成啊！”
    王树庆心里有个红太阳，他最爱读毛主席的书。当反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿妄想把中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》作为党课的教材的时候，王树庆就在日记中写道：“我感到毛主席著作就是党的政策，党课的教材。党员必须学好毛主席著作，才算一个好党员！”他充满革命激情地说：“千种书，万种书，最好的书是毛主席的书。生长在新社会里，这也是幸福，那也是幸福，最大的幸福是读毛主席的书。”
    毛主席的书是革命人民的宝，可是，在无产阶级文化大革命前却不易买到。一次，王树庆到新华书店去买《毛泽东选集》，售书员问他：“你有票吗？”王树庆很奇怪，为什么买毛主席的革命宝书还得凭票？在这次无产阶级文化大革命中他才懂得，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙疯狂反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。他们为出版各种毒草大开绿灯，而对革命群众所渴望得到的毛主席的革命宝书却横加限制。王树庆十分愤怒。他说：“有了毛主席，才有人民的一切；有了毛泽东思想，才能奔向共产主义。敌人越是反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们越是要学。”
    为了买到不用凭票购买的革命宝书，王树庆每隔几天就向新华书店跑一趟。有一次，书店偶然来了一批不需凭票购买的《毛泽东选集》。人们听到消息，象潮水似地涌向书店。王树庆本来排队的位置比较靠前，完全可以买到。可是他看到千万颗红心向着红太阳，心中无比欢畅，就主动把一个个后来的人让到自己前面，等他来到书柜前，这一批《毛泽东选集》已经卖完了。售书员不解地问他：“你空跑了好多趟，今天有书了，你怎么老让别人呢？”王树庆微笑着说：“人人都需要毛泽东思想，我着急，他们也着急啊！这次没买着，下次再来。”
    售书员望着这位无限热爱毛主席的解放军战士，听到他那朴素而真诚的话语，深深地感动了。当王树庆第七次来到新华书店时，终于在这位热情的售书员的帮助下，买到了一套他日夜盼望得到的《毛泽东选集》。他双手接过金光闪闪的革命宝书，激动地打开了第一卷，凝视着伟大领袖毛主席的像，眼睛里含着泪花，象是在默默地向毛主席宣誓：敬爱的毛主席啊！我日日夜夜盼望得到您的革命宝书，今天终于得到了。我一定要好好地读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，永远做您的好战士。
    王树庆平时从不随便花钱，他把节省下来的津贴费大部分买了毛主席像和毛主席著作，送给亲友，送给同志，送给贫下中农，让大家共同用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。有一次，他到书店买《毛泽东选集》第二卷时，看到身旁有一个农村干部模样的人手里也捧着第二卷，自言自语地说：“太好了，我就缺这第二卷了。”可是这个同志掏了掏衣兜，发现钱不够，只得又把书放下，恋恋不舍地走出了书店。王树庆看到这种情形，忙对售书员说：“快，再来一本第二卷。”他接过革命宝书，追出门去，送给了那位素不相识的同志。还有一次，他买了几十本“老三篇”，一出门，便一本一本地送给了一群红小兵。有人问他：“你认识他们吗？”王树庆憨厚地回答：“不认识。不过，他们是革命的接班人，可需要毛泽东思想啦！”
    把想的、说的、做的都连在毛泽东思想的红线上
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志指示我们：“要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学。哪一级都要学。学了就要用，搞好思想革命化。”
    王树庆就是按照林副主席的指示做的。他发扬了毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，学习“老三篇”，一字一句认真领会，一字一句对照检查，一字一句见诸行动。他写下的几万字日记，全都是活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观的纪实。其中有三分之一是反复学习“老三篇”的笔记。他时时要求自己想的、说的、做的，都要无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，想的、说的、做的，都要连在毛泽东思想的红线上。
    王树庆入伍以后，第一年就被评为五好战士，第二年光荣地加入了中国共产党。但是，他丝毫没有放松对自己的严格要求。当他发现自己的头脑里隐藏着一个“荣誉”、“前途”的私字时，便用“老三篇”这个锐利武器把它挖出来。他严厉地责问自己：“为个人荣誉、名利去工作，那有什么意义？那是多么可耻！”“这种思想发展下去，不正是走轻于鸿毛的道路吗？”“私心多了，离毛泽东思想就远了。”为了永远紧跟毛主席，实现解放全人类的崇高理想，他严格要求自己要把想的、说的、做的三点连在一条线上，达到一个目的——紧跟毛主席，解放全人类。他深深懂得：要紧跟毛主席，用毛泽东思想解放全人类，首先要用毛泽东思想解放自己的灵魂。在小组的里屋门上边，在金光闪闪的毛主席像下，他写上了“破私立公”“灭资兴无”八个大字。他遵照毛主席的教导，走破私立公的道路，在灵魂深处爆发革命，在思想革命中打进攻战。
    王树庆的小组驻在长白山西麓一个村子的一座小草房里。他们为了维护国防通信线路，要翻过三十多座山岭，穿过十几块沼泽地，有些地段不能通过，只好绕道走。这样，每次巡修线路的时间就长了。为了改变全线的自然环境，使线路的故障能够及时排除，他和小组的两个同志一道，决心在一道道陡坡上修出梯登，在一块块沼泽地上架起便桥。他们早出晚归，一天只吃两顿饭，一锨一镐，一刀一斧，辛辛苦苦地刚在两道山坡上修起了非常整齐的台阶式梯登，可是一场大雨，就全被冲毁了。
    工作上遇到了困难，私心就可能乘虚而入。梯登被雨冲毁后，王树庆头脑里就出现了是继续修还是不修的矛盾。通过学习“老三篇”，他克服了私心，得到了一条新的体会：“我们虽然当了兵，穿的是黄军装，但并不等于我们每一个人都加入了全心全意为人民服务的队伍。毛主席所说的张思德同志就是我们这个队伍中的一个同志，是说张思德同志已加入了‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务的行列。”
    为了真正从思想上加入“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的行列，王树庆在灵魂深处摆开了斗私的战场，让张思德、白求恩、老愚公的光辉形象始终伴随自己战斗。夏天，他和战友们顶着烈日的曝晒，忍受着树丛间蒸笼般的闷热，光着膀子，不顾蚊虫、瞎虻的叮咬，顽强地战斗；冬天，他又领着战友，迎着风雪的吹打，把从山上砍下的木料，一根一根地扛到积着深雪的沼泽地，在那里架起木桥。
    经过一年的苦战，王树庆终于和战友们一起，在毛泽东思想的指引下，不仅在群山中修出了二千一百多个梯登，在沼泽地上架起十几座便桥，开辟了一条查线的道路，大大缩短了巡修线路的时间；更重要的，是在自己的头脑里修出了一条破私立公，实现思想革命化的大道。
    王树庆连续三年被评为五好战士，被选为部队的学习毛主席著作积极分子，他领导的小组也成了先进小组。但他从不骄傲自满，总是不断争取新的进步。他说：“志在顶峰的人，决不会在半坡停留。”一次，领导上关心地问他：“你们小组还有什么问题？”他一下没有答出来。过后，他就抓住这个“没有问题”的问题，对照毛主席的教导：“谁要是只看见成绩一面，不看见缺点一面，谁也就不会很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”接着他给自己提出了许多问题：我的一切工作都做好了吗？私心都克服了吗？对没有评上四好的小组和没有评上五好的同志进行了帮助没有？他们的思想情况和工作情况怎样？他用“完全”“彻底”和“两个极端”对照自己，发现了不足。他说：“看不到缺点是最大的缺点，找不到差距就不能前进！”他经常用这样的警言鼓舞自己：
    思想革命，好似长征，
    每进一步，都要斗争。
    长征有千山万水和敌人的阻拦，
    思想改造有公与私、个人与集体的斗争。
    长征要流血，
    思想革命必须深入灵魂。
    他就这样活学活用毛主席著作，战斗不息，改造不息，大步奔向思想革命化的新境地。
    永远做毛主席革命路线的红色保卫者
    王树庆，是一个通信线路的优秀维护兵，更是一个毛主席无产阶级革命路线的红色保卫者。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命刚刚兴起，王树庆便怀着对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚，立即从山村投入了战斗。他以笔作刀枪，从批判“三家村”开始，就一直在挥笔作战。有人说：“我们水平低，批判文章写不好。”王树庆说：“这不是水平问题，是态度问题，这是捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗！”
    当他听说中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“剥削有功”的谬论时，肺简直要气炸了。为了彻底批判这一反革命谬论，他领着战士康连德来到老贫农王奎武家，请老人用自己的亲身经历和他们一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫。王奎武老大爷，这位在旧社会喝尽苦水的老贫农，那能容得中国赫鲁晓夫倒转时代的车轮！他愤怒地控诉了旧社会，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫，一再嘱咐自己的子弟兵，千万要保卫毛主席，要坚决打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    两个战士回到小组，心情久久不能平静。他们面对面地回忆了自己的家史。王树庆想起在旧社会里，爷爷被地主勾结土匪打死，叔叔和伯父被日本侵略军抓劳工惨死在外乡的情景，悲愤交加，他说：“我们绝不能忘记过去，忘记过去就是背叛！中国赫鲁晓夫说什么‘剥削有功’，这纯粹是胡说八道！我们要大喊一声：剥削就是有罪！罪该万死！”
    王树庆望着毛主席像，觉得有许多话要对毛主席讲。他激动地对康连德说：“来，我们向毛主席宣誓！”茅草屋里，两个战士站在毛主席像前，举起了拳头：“毛主席呀！我们是您的战士，我们坚决用鲜血和生命保卫您，谁要是反对您，我们就和他拚到底！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，王树庆虽然没有担负“三支”“两军”工作，但他把保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线视为自己的天职。他满怀对毛主席的无限忠诚，满怀对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，思考着一个问题：象我这样一个住在山沟、单独执勤的战士，应当怎样为无产阶级文化大革命作出贡献？他的回答是：不仅自己要坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，而且要让自己的亲人，让自己的战友，让自己所能接触到的一切群众，都坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边！
    王树庆发出的一封封的家信，都是宣传毛主席革命路线的传单。当他在生产队当会计的哥哥，面临反革命经济主义的黑风的侵袭时；当他在学校读书的未婚妻，受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽时，王树庆总是一次又一次地把毛主席的声音，及时送到他们的心坎上，帮助他们戳穿党内一小撮走资派的阴谋，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    王树庆所在的连队分散在很长的线路上。他利用电话、写信和连队集中整训的机会，同全连百分之八十的同志谈过心。每次，他都要问一问战友个人和家庭在文化大革命中遇到了什么问题。一次，他从电话上了解到战友孙万和在农村当干部的哥哥被群众贴了大字报，有点思想不通。王树庆先和孙万和在电话里学习了一段毛主席语录：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”鼓励他帮助哥哥学习毛主席著作，经受群众运动的考验。孙万和连着给哥哥写了几封信。后来，他哥哥来信说：群众对他帮助很大，现在自己又被群众选为干部，还说收到了寄来的《毛泽东选集》，今后一定要好好学习。孙万和很奇怪，是谁给哥哥寄书了呢？原来是王树庆！
    无产阶级文化大革命的东风，鼓舞着山村的贫下中农热火朝天地起来闹革命。王树庆始终和群众在一起并肩战斗。他帮助革命群众，把斗争的矛头始终对
  准真正的敌人。贫下中农斗争不法的地富反坏分子，
  他热情地鼓舞群众：“大家要发动起来，才能斗深斗透。”贫下中农高兴地说：“王班长总是支持我们的！”
    山村的群众发动起来了。他们把权从地主分子的手中夺了回来，选一位贫农当会计。那位贫农怕干不好，不敢接。王树庆知道了，就接二连三地上门做思想工作，和他一起学习《为人民服务》。王树庆说，我们贫下中农要有革命的志气，咱们不干，还能再让地主干？只要有一颗为人民掌权的红心，就一定能干好！
    在阶级斗争的暴风骤雨中，王树庆深深懂得多一个人掌握毛泽东思想，就多一份革命的力量。因此，他走到那里，就在那里发动群众活学活用毛主席著作，就把“老三篇”的光辉思想传播到那里。有一次，他因公外出，住在一所旅社，一看旅客来自四面八方，晚上都没有什么事，正是宣传毛泽东思想的好机会。于是，他就和战友们唱起了毛主席语录歌，把旅客集合起来，向大家宣传无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，谈活学活用毛主席著作的重要性，组织大家一起学习毛主席语录，给了旅客和旅店工作人员以很大教育和启发。从这以后，这个旅店就把组织旅客学习毛主席著作作为一项制度坚持了下来。在驻地，王树庆宣传毛泽东思想更是积极。在上级帮助下，他和战友们办起了一个由民兵参加的毛主席著作学习班，推动了村里学习毛主席著作群众运动的发展。毛泽东思想统一着全村贫下中农的思想，“公”字的世界扩大了，“私”字的地盘缩小了。大家一个心眼，迈着一个步伐，坚定地走在社会主义的光明大道上。贫下中农称赞王树庆说：“他可真是站在保卫毛主席的第一线了。都象他那样，我们的无产阶级江山就是铁打钢铸的了！”
    “人类解放我解放，我愿一生为人民”
    一九六七年“五一”国际劳动节，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中来到了。
    为保卫无产阶级文化大革命日夜战斗在深山密林里的王树庆，看到“百万工农齐踊跃”的大好形势，想到首都革命群众又将受到最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的检阅，心情万分激动，一早就和康连德一起出发执行战备巡修任务去了。
    他们来到了挡石河边。连日暴雨，河水猛涨，一条用乱石堆成的河坝已被激流吞没，河水挡住了他们的去路。
    王树庆站在河岸上，望着对岸伸向远方的通信线路。这是一条连接北京和祖国边疆的红色线路，是一条传达毛主席和党中央的声音的红色线路啊！风雨天，线路最容易出故障，阶级斗争这样激烈，敌人也很可能乘机破坏。为了保证线路的畅通，王树庆毅然决定：“涉水过河！”
    河岸上，王树庆和康连德打开了红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。这是他们今天出发之后第七次学习毛主席语录了。面对着咆哮的河水，王树庆和康连德高声朗读：
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    他们在齐腰的激流中迈进，每移一步都十分艰难。忽然，一个危急情况发生了，康连德被冲得眼看就要滑到坝下。王树庆全然忘记了个人的安危，一面高声呼喊：“康连德，往上靠！”一面急忙向康连德走去。就在这个时候，一股猛烈的山洪铺天盖地冲来，两个战士都落水了。
    康连德被冲到河弯上，抓住一棵倾倒的树干，他急切地大声呼叫：“班——长！班——长……”
    顿时，田里的社员丢下了犁杖，妇女扔下了孩子，学生放下了书本，从四面八方跑来，河岸聚集了几百人。会水的青壮年，纷纷跳进了挡石河。老人、妇女、儿童在岸上来回奔跑，连声呼唤：“王班长！王班长！王——班——长！”
    王树庆不能回答亲人们的呼唤了。他为了保卫毛主席，保卫国防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，光荣地献出了年轻的生命。
    不幸的消息传开，成千上万的工人、农民、解放军战士、红卫兵小将和革命干部，迎着风雨，顶着盛暑，爬山涉水，从四面八方络绎不绝地来到烈士墓前，学习烈士的革命精神，对烈士表示悼念。在斗私批修的新的战斗中，父母嘱咐自己的孩子，青年们互相勉励：要象王树庆那样，无限忠于毛主席，做“老三篇”哺育出来的共产主义新人。
    现在，毛主席的好战士王树庆的光辉事迹，已经传遍长白山麓的大小山村，传遍了祖国东北的许多城镇、乡村和军营。一位贫农社员，带着能拉会唱的儿子和女儿，全家参加了王树庆事迹宣传队。王树庆烈士遗诗谱成的歌曲，正在传向四面八方：
    高举红旗向前进，永远革命不忘本。
    忆苦思甜增干劲，学习先烈为人民。
    一生立下革命志，想到世界受苦人。
    人类解放我解放，我愿一生为人民。
