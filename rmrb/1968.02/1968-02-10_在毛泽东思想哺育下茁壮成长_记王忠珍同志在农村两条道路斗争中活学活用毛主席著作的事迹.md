The helmsman steers the ship, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful weapon in revolutionary struggle. As long as we grasp this weapon, we can be invincible and unyielding in our struggle against the class enemy.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the sunshine and rain that nurtures our growth. Wang Zhujin, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from Modi County, Guiyang Province, is a new person who has grown up under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought. She strives to study Chairman Mao's works and acts according to his instructions. In the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, she stands firm, clearly distinguishes between right and wrong, and steadfastly walks the socialist road. In the sharp struggle against the class enemy, she is courageous and bold, good at uniting the masses, and repels the class enemy's counter-revolutionary restoration. She says, "My parents gave me my body, but Chairman Mao gave me my soul. The more I read Chairman Mao's books, the more I feel that the higher the mountains, the more there is to strive for, the deeper the wells, the more there is to dig, the greater the difficulties, the more there is to overcome, and the more ferocious the enemy, the more there is to fight."

Growing Strong in Class Struggle

In 1961, Wang Zhujin responded to Chairman Mao's great call and returned from school to Modi County, Baiyao Brigade to engage in agricultural production.

At that time, under the influence of the "three freedoms and one contract" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, a black wind of "dividing land to households" blew through Baiyao Brigade. Some wealthy peasants, with the support of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, divided up the good land and took away the cattle and horses. Landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists also came out, cutting down mountains and forests, "continuing family genealogies," and conducting counter-revolutionary restoration, seriously damaging the collective economy.

Wang Zhujin saw this situation and was very anxious. She rushed to the higher authorities to expose the "dividing land to households" issue. However, the response she received was, "This is a policy pushed down from above." At that time, Wang Zhujin was a girl not yet sixteen years old and did not understand that this was class struggle. But she firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that the poor and lower-middle peasants should organize and walk the socialist road. She thought, Chairman Mao always thinks of us poor and lower-middle peasants, "dividing land to households" must not be Chairman Mao's policy. No matter who is "above," as long as it does not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, we must struggle against it!

In the spring of 1962, a few cadres in Baiyao Brigade, with the support of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, proposed a formal plan for "contracting production to households" and called for the community members to pass it. Wang Zhujin then organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to resist. She said at the community meeting, Chairman Mao calls on us to walk the socialist collectivization road. We should listen to Chairman Mao's words and advance towards the bright future he points out. We must not violate Chairman Mao's teachings and take the individual farming road. The poor and lower-middle peasants, under Wang Zhujin's leadership, vetoed the "contracting production to households" plan.

From then on, those who wanted to take the capitalist road saw Wang Zhujin as a thorn in their side and threatened her, "You have ruined our 'contracting production to households' plan, and the public grain and surplus grain of the entire brigade will be your responsibility!" Wang Zhujin retorted, "You do not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, do not walk the socialist road, and engage in individual farming. We poor and lower-middle peasants will firmly oppose it."

In the winter of 1962, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle," like a spring thunder echoing throughout the country, and further awakened Wang Zhujin.

When it comes to class struggle, Wang Zhujin knows that the poor and lower-middle peasants all have a history of blood and tears. Before liberation, Wang Zhujin's family could not pay the rent, and her grandfather was beaten to death by the landlord. Her father was injured in the head and blinded by a blow. The family fled from Kaiyang to Xifeng and then from Xifeng to Modi. In the old society, how many poor and lower-middle peasants, like water hyacinths on the water, drifted from one place to another, living a life worse than cattle and horses. It was Chairman Mao who led the poor and lower-middle peasants to revolt and stand up. This is the history of class struggle! Chairman Mao teaches, "The remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended.... The question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." Chairman Mao's teachings suddenly clarified the issue, and she saw through the phenomenon to the essence. She saw that the class enemy still existed, and that "four freedoms" and "contracting production to households" were attempts to restore capitalism and must be firmly resisted! Thus, she organized the militia and the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle in socialist society, mobilized the masses to criticize the capitalist black wind, and suppressed the counter-revolutionary restoration by landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

Wang Zhujin realized in the struggle that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light of class struggle, and only by following Mao Zedong Thought can one never lose one's way. From then on, she studied Chairman Mao's works even more eagerly, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasant youth, she organized a study group for Chairman Mao's works and established a cultural room to propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1965, Baiyao Brigade began the great Four Clean-ups movement, and Wang Zhujin took the lead in struggling against capitalist forces. At that time, someone said to her, "We are relatives, living in the same village, and there has been nothing wrong for many years. Please give me some face!" Someone advised her, "Girl, you should plant more flowers and fewer thorns!" Someone even threatened her, "Now you are persecuting me, and later we'll see who persecutes whom!" She thought to herself, Chairman Mao says, "In the world, there is no love without reason, and there is no hatred without reason." I love the great leader Chairman Mao and the bright road of socialism. I hate the capitalist road and the class enemy who tries to drag us towards capitalism. I should only speak of class affinity and not of kinship. She was not afraid of retaliation and fought resolutely against the class enemy.

Under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought and the tempering of class struggle storms, Wang Zhujin gradually grew up. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyao Brigade loved, trusted, and supported her, and elected her as the chairman of the brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants' association. Soon, Wang Zhujin was honored to join the Communist Party of China. In the later stages of the Four Clean-ups movement, she also served as the secretary of the brigade party branch and the political instructor of the militia company, and was selected as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works.

A New Severe Test

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began! Wang Zhujin faced a new severe test.

After the National Day in 1966, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Guizhou launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Guizhou region. Wang Zhujin and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyao Brigade also posted big-character posters, actively supporting the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Guiyang region. Their big-character posters spread to the surrounding villages, igniting the flames of revolution.

Soon, a work team directly controlled by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee was stationed in Baiyao Brigade. They thought that Wang Zhujin was a party member under their leadership, and that Baiyao Brigade was a "model" they had personally cultivated. They were familiar with the people and affairs there, and they organized the "royalist army" there, which was as stable as wearing iron shoes and using a crutch. They ran around, distorted right and wrong, spread rumors, and deliberately confused the boundaries between revolution and counter-revolution, suppressing the revolutionary faction.

Wang Zhujin saw the actions of these "old superiors" and had many doubts in her mind. She brought her questions to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches, "Communist Party members must ask why about everything, must think it over carefully in their own minds, and consider whether it conforms to reality and whether it is reasonable. They must never follow blindly and must never advocate slavishness." She thought, The Red Guards' rebellion against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party is a revolutionary action. Why do they suppress the Red Guards in every possible way and launch a brutal siege against them? Chairman Mao calls on us to direct the spearhead of struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, but they instigate the poor and lower-middle peasants to drive out the Red Guards. Isn't this a blatant challenge to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line? Chairman Mao calls on us, "You should pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Why do they want us to focus only on production and not to write big-character posters? She thought of the capitalist black wind that blew through the countryside in 1961 and 1962. Isn't this the policy they pushed down? Wang Zhujin repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "Sixteen Points." She gradually broke away from the small circle of her "old superiors" and realized that this work team was sent by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee to make trouble. She must expose this trick. She wrote a big-character poster exposing the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee in suppressing revolutionary masses and the conspiracy activities of the "work team," and posted it on the main street of the commune.

At that time, someone advised her, "You were able to become the secretary of the brigade party branch because of the cultivation of those above. If those above fall, can you still stand?" Someone also gave her advice, "If you don't rebel, people will say you are a royalist, but if you rebel, you should leave some room." Wang Zhujin said to them, Your opinions do not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. I must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and must never be half-hearted. Whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, I will resolutely resist and oppose it. Someone else said to her, "This is not just your personal matter. Fertilizer is supplied from above. If you rebel, they won't give it to us." Wang Zhujin said, "Even if they don't give it, we won't be afraid. We will learn from Dazhai and take the road of self-reliance."

At that time, a member of the "work team," who was also the former district committee secretary who had developed Wang Zhujin into the Party, said to Wang Zhujin, "Little Wang, don't forget your roots! You should think about who it was that cultivated you. We have put our hearts into it!" Wang Zhujin replied firmly, "I am cultivated by the Party and Chairman Mao. My 'roots' are the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. This 'root,' I remember the most firmly and love the deepest. I will never forget it. Because I do not forget my roots, I must vow to defend Chairman Mao. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, I will fight to the end with them!" This district committee secretary, in a rage, shouted, "Have you read 'Cultivation'? You are a Party member, and Party members must have organizational discipline. A Party member rebelling against a Party member is anti-Party!" Wang Zhujin could no longer suppress her anger and angrily refuted, "I have not read 'Cultivation.' I have only read Chairman Mao's books! The great Communist Party of China was founded by Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul and life of the Party. You oppose Mao Zedong Thought, which is to oppose the Party! The one opposing the Party is not me, but you!"

Through this struggle, Wang Zhujin clarified many issues. She exposed to the broad revolutionary masses the various evil activities of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee through the "work team" in Baiyao Brigade. She, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, drove the "work team" out of Baiyao Brigade and exposed and struggled against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Modi County Party Committee.

Standing at the Forefront of the Struggle to Defend the Achievements of the Four Clean-ups

A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, in order to save their failing fate, rallied the landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the countryside to launch a fierce counterattack. They said that those cadres who had made serious mistakes and were removed from their posts during the "Four Clean-ups" were "victims" and were willing to "rehabilitate" them. They used "rebellion" as a pretext and directed the spearhead of struggle against the poor and lower-middle peasants and the good and relatively good cadres who had grown up during the Four Clean-ups movement, especially against Wang Zhujin. They spread rumors, saying that Wang Zhujin was an "individualist" and the "leader of a counter-revolutionary clique" who had come out, attempting to sabotage the great achievements of the Four Clean-ups movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Defending the great achievements of the Four Clean-ups movement is to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In this extremely sharp class struggle, Wang Zhujin stood firm and clearly distinguished between right and wrong.

For a period of time, every day someone came to Wang Zhujin to "rebel," demanding money, demanding rice, and forcing her to "remove their hats." Wang Zhujin always waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and firmly replied to them, "You want to reverse the case, you can't. Chairman Mao did not say so, and I can't do it!"

At the critical moment of class struggle, Wang Zhujin thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries."

How to organize the masses who truly support the revolution? Wang Zhujin thought deeply. She thought, "Thousands of principles, Mao Zedong Thought is the first. Only with Mao Zedong Thought can we unify the thoughts of the masses and organize the masses to defeat the enemy." She first united a few young people who were the most steadfast in struggle. Then, they continued to organize the poor and lower-middle peasants and the militia to study Chairman Mao's works in a fighting posture. They used Mao Zedong Thought to solve various problems in the masses' minds and, together with the revolutionary masses, used the method of class analysis to distinguish who is a revolutionary and who is a capitalist roader. In this way, the class line became clear, and the revolutionary masses' relationship with Wang Zhujin became even closer.

Once, Wang Zhujin studied Chairman Mao's works with the militia. A comrade said to her, "Little Wang, the enemy is spreading the word that if they don't kill you, they won't be able to stand in Baiyao." Wang Zhujin said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. In this struggle, bloodshed and sacrifice are inevitable. But our revolutionary cause will always advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will definitely be victorious!" Everyone said, "Little Wang is right! With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with the powerful People's Liberation Army as our backing, and with the iron wall of poor and lower-middle peasants and militia, even if the sky falls, we can hold it up!" Wang Zhujin opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and led everyone to read, "We must eliminate all weak and cowardly thoughts within ourselves. All views that overestimate the enemy's strength and underestimate the people's strength are wrong." "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by enemies." "Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." The more they studied, the more powerful they felt. They wrote big-character posters together to continue exposing the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in promoting capitalist restoration in the countryside.

One night, a fine rain fell continuously. The deputy chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association of Baiyao Brigade, Long Dabo, was on duty at the coal mine and heard that the class enemy had planned to harm Wang Zhujin that night. He groped in the dark to find Wang Zhujin in various teams. That evening, Wang Zhujin went to the farthest fifth team to arrange work. It was past midnight, and she was walking alone on the road when she encountered Long Dabo. She heard Long Dabo's situation and was very excited, thinking, Long Dabo is a poor peasant who truly supports the revolution. Long Dabo came to protect me, who instructed him to come? It is Mao Zedong Thought! When they reached a fork in the road, they saw a few shadows moving, and the class enemy was indeed waiting for her. The deep-seated class hatred surged in Wang Zhujin's heart, and she shouted, "What are you doing here in the middle of the night!" Long Dabo followed with a loud roar, "You bastards, be careful that we poor and lower-middle peasants will break your backs!" Those few bastards, upon hearing that someone was protecting Wang Zhujin, fled up the mountain in a panic.

The struggle did not end. One night, under the plot of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists from Modi, Kaiyang, and Xifeng, along with a group of outsiders, found Wang Zhujin to conduct counter-revolutionary restoration. Wang Zhujin looked up and saw no poor and lower-middle peasants from her own brigade, and her heart was a bit unsettled. She thought, What will happen tonight? She took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from her pocket and immediately calmed down. She thought, I am not alone. I have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought with me. No matter what happens, I am not afraid!

A few landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists demanded that Wang Zhujin "confess her crimes!" She raised her head high and said, "Landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and capitalist roaders, all get out! Communist Party members do not bow their heads to the enemy!" A man said to her in a slippery tone, "Ah, Secretary, you are young and have a bright future. As long as you confess, stand on our side, it's fine!" Wang Zhujin heard this and her anger rose. She said, "I am a Communist Party member. Chairman Mao teaches us, 'For Communist Party members, it is to stand on the Party's side, stand on the side of Party nature and Party policy.' If I stand on your side, am I not consorting with the enemy?" At this time, the landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists instigated the cadres who had made serious mistakes and were removed from their posts during the "Four Clean-ups" to force Wang Zhujin to sign and return the "Four Clean-ups" restitution items to them and demanded that Wang Zhujin "hand over the power!"

In front of the word "power," Wang Zhujin's thoughts surged. She remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." She thought, The proletarian dictatorship is the fundamental issue of the revolution. The poor and lower-middle peasants have everything with power, and losing power means losing everything. Chairman Mao, for the sake of the poor and lower-middle peasants' liberation and seizing power, has struggled for decades. How many revolutionary martyrs have shed blood and sacrificed their lives. If power is handed over to the class enemy, how many poor and lower-middle peasants will lose their heads. She said firmly, "Power belongs to the poor and lower-middle peasants. Even if you put a knife to my neck, I will not give it to you!"

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyao Brigade heard that Wang Zhujin was besieged and rushed to support her. Wang Zhujin held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said passionately, "With Chairman Mao backing us, we dare to climb the mountain of knives and walk through the sea of fire. With Mao Zedong Thought, we dare to compete with the devil and show our heroism in front of the enemy. With Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the people's mountains and rivers are guaranteed, and the red flag of revolution will fly forever." Then Wang Zhujin pointed out sharply that the siege and struggle against her was a counter-revolutionary restoration conducted by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and the Modi region in collusion with the landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. She took up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud, "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary...." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyao Brigade also sang the song of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The boundless Mao Zedong Thought dispelled the witchcraft spread by the class enemy. The counter-revolutionary restoration meeting planned by the class enemy became a trial of the enemy and a meeting to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. A handful of class enemies, seeing that the situation was not in their favor, fled.

Wang Zhujin worked for a day and fought for a night. When she stepped into her house, she saw the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall and could not help but shed tears of excitement. She wanted to pour out all the words she had been holding back to Chairman Mao. She gazed at the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao for a long time and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long live to Chairman Mao!" At that time, a red sun rose from the east. Wang Zhujin picked up her hoe and, facing the sunrise, went to the fields to work with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

After the fierce class struggle, Wang Zhujin and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyao Brigade further raised their class consciousness and strengthened their class struggle awareness. When the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee was established, Wang Zhujin was unanimously elected by the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the poor and lower-middle peasants as a standing committee member of the provincial revolutionary committee.

After Wang Zhujin became a standing committee member of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, she studied Chairman Mao's works even more diligently. In addition to her daily work, she often went to the production teams near Guiyang City and her own commune's production teams to participate in labor, listen to the opinions of the masses, help the masses solve problems, and organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's works, seriously engage in "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism," and carry out revolutionary criticism. She was determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fight to the end with the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. At the same time, she would break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, thoroughly transform her worldview, and further arm herself with the great Mao Zedong Thought.

    在毛泽东思想哺育下茁壮成长
    ——记王忠珍同志在农村两条道路斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的事迹
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是我们进行革命斗争最强大的武器。只要掌握了这个武器，就能在同阶级敌人搏斗中，无往不胜，无坚不摧。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是哺育我们成长的阳光雨露。贵州省活学活用毛主席著作积极分子、修文县白窑大队党支部书记王忠珍，就是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的新人。她努力学习毛主席著作，处处按照毛主席的指示办事，在农村两条道路的斗争中，立场坚定，爱憎分明，坚定不移地走社会主义道路；在同阶级敌人进行尖锐的斗争中，有勇气，有胆略，善于团结群众，打退阶级敌人的反革命复辟。她说：“爹妈给了我肉体，毛主席给了我灵魂。我越读毛主席的书，越觉得山越高越有奔头，井越深越有挖头，困难越大越有闯头，敌人越凶恶越有斗头。”
      在阶级斗争中锻炼成长
    一九六一年，王忠珍响应毛主席的伟大号召，从学校回到修文县白窑大队参加农业生产。
    那时，在中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”影响下，白窑大队也刮起一股“分田到户”的黑风。一些富裕农民在党内一小撮走资派的支持下，分走了好田，拉走了牛马；地富反坏分子也跳了出来，砍山伐林，“续家谱”，进行反攻倒算，使集体经济受到了严重的破坏。
    王忠珍看到这种情形，心中很焦急，就跑到上级机关揭发“分田到户”问题。但是，她得到的回答是：“这是上边推行下来的政策”。这时王忠珍还是个不满十六岁的小姑娘，认识不到这就是阶级斗争，但她牢记着毛主席要贫下中农组织起来走社会主义道路的教导，她想：毛主席总是为我们贫下中农着想的，
  “分田到户”肯定不是毛主席的政策，不管“上边”是谁，只要不符合毛主席的教导，就要进行斗争！
    一九六二年春天，白窑大队有少数干部，在党内一小撮走资派的支持下，提出“包产到户”的正式方案，叫社员通过。王忠珍就串连贫下中农进行抵制。她在社员大会上说，毛主席号召我们走社会主义集体化道路，我们应当听毛主席的话，朝着毛主席指出的光明大道前进，决不能违反毛主席的教导，走单干的路。贫下中农在王忠珍的带动下，否决了“包产到户”方案。
    从这以后，那些想走资本主义道路的人，把王忠珍看作了眼中钉，威胁她：“你破坏了我们‘包产到户’的计划，全队的公粮余粮都由你负责！”王忠珍反驳他们：“你们不按毛主席指示办事，不走社会主义道路，搞单干，我们贫下中农就要坚决反对。”
    一九六二年冬，毛主席发出“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，象一声春雷响彻全国；也把王忠珍进一步唤醒了。
    提起阶级斗争，王忠珍知道贫下中农都有一本血泪史。解放前，王忠珍家交不起地租，祖父被地主打死了；父亲被砍伤了头，打瞎了眼；一家人从开阳逃到息烽，又从息烽逃到修文。在旧社会，多少贫下中农，象水上的浮萍，从一处漂泊到另一处，过着牛马不如的生活。是毛主席领导贫下中农闹革命翻了身的。这都是阶级斗争的历史啊！毛主席教导说：“被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。……社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”毛主席的教导一下子把问题点破了，她透过现象看到本质。她看到阶级敌人还存在，搞“四大自由”、“包产到户”就是复辟资本主义，必须进行坚决斗争！于是，她组织民兵和贫下中农学习毛主席关于社会主义社会中阶级和阶级斗争的教导，发动群众批判资本主义黑风，打击地富反坏的反攻倒算。
    王忠珍在斗争中认识到，毛泽东思想是阶级斗争的指路明灯，只有用毛泽东思想来引路，才永远不会迷失方向。从此，她更加如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，同贫下中农青年一起组织了毛主席著作学习小组，还建立了文化室来宣传毛泽东思想。
    一九六五年，白窑大队开始了伟大的四清运动，王忠珍奋勇当先，对资本主义势力进行了斗争。这时有人找她说：“我们是亲戚，住在一个寨子，多年没啥事对不起你，要给我留些情面啊！”有人劝她：“姑娘家，要多栽花，少栽刺哟！”也有人威胁她：“现在你整我，等以后看谁整倒谁！”她听了这些话后，心中想道：毛主席说，“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨”，我爱的是伟大领袖毛主席，是社会主义光明大道，恨的是资本主义道路，是妄图把我们拉向资本主义的阶级敌人；我只应讲阶级亲，不能讲亲戚亲。她不怕打击报复，同阶级敌人进行了坚决的斗争。
    王忠珍在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争风浪的锻炼中，逐渐成长起来了。白窑大队的贫下中农喜爱她，信任她，支持她，选她担任了大队贫协主席。不久，王忠珍光荣地加入了中国共产党，四清运动后期又担任了大队党支部书记和民兵连指导员，并被推选为学习毛主席著作的积极分子。
        一场新的严峻考验
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开始了！王忠珍又面临着一场严峻的考验。
    一九六六年国庆节后，贵州省的无产阶级革命派向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在贵州地区的代理人，发动了猛烈的进攻。王忠珍和白窑大队的贫下中农也贴出大字报，积极支持贵阳地区无产阶级革命派的革命行动。他们的大字报，传遍了周围的村寨，点起了革命的火焰。
    不久，一个由贵州省委内一小撮走资派直接控制的工作组，驻到了白窑大队。他们以为王忠珍是在他们手下入党的，白窑大队又是他们亲手培养的一个
  “典型”，熟人熟事，在那里组织起“保皇军”，那简直是“穿钉鞋，拄拐棍，稳上加稳。”他们东窜西跳，颠倒黑白，散播谣言，极力混淆革命和反革命的界限，打击革命派。
    王忠珍看到这些“老上级”的言行，思想上出现了很多疑问，便带着问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”她想：红卫兵造党内一小撮走资派的反，是革命的行动，为什么他们对红卫兵小将，进行百般打击，残酷围攻呢？毛主席要我们把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资派，而他们却唆使贫下中农赶红卫兵，这不是明目张胆地对抗毛主席的革命路线吗？毛主席号召我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”他们为什么要我们只抓好生产，不要写大字报呢？她想到一九六一年和一九六二年在农村中刮起的资本主义黑风，这不就是他们推行下来的吗？王忠珍反复地学习毛主席有关文化大革命的指示和“十六条”，她渐渐地从“老上级”的小圈子里跳出来，认识到这个工作组是贵州省委内一小撮走资派派来捣鬼的，一定要把这个鬼把戏戳穿。她写了揭露贵州省委内一小撮走资派镇压革命群众的罪行和“工作组”阴谋活动的大字报，贴在公社所在地的大街上。
    这时，有的人劝她说：“你能当上大队党支部书记，是和上边人的培养分不开的，上边的人倒了，你还站得住吗？”也有人为她出主意：“不造反，人家会说你保皇，但造反要留有余地。”王忠珍对他们说：你们的意见都不符合毛主席的教导；我要无限忠于毛主席，决不能半心半意，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的事情，我就要坚决抵制它，反对它。又有人对她说：“这不是你一个人的事情，化肥是上边供应的，你造反了，人家就不给我们了。”王忠珍说：“不给也不怕，我们学大寨，走自力更生的道路。”
    这时，“工作组”的一个成员，也就是以前发展过王忠珍入党的区委书记，对王忠珍说：“小王，你不要忘本啊！你应该想一想，是那个把你培养起来的？这里有我们的一份心血啊！……”王忠珍毫不含糊地回答他道：“我是党和毛主席培养起来的，我的‘本’是伟大的领袖毛主席，是伟大的毛泽东思想；这个‘本’，我记得最牢，爱得最深，什么时候都忘不了。我正因为不忘本，我才要誓死保卫毛主席，谁胆敢反对毛主席，我就要和他拚到底！”这个区委书记气急败坏地叫道：“你读过《修养》没有？你是个党员，党员要有组织纪律性，党员造党员的反就是反党！”王忠珍再也压不住心中的怒火，愤怒地驳斥说：“我没有读过《修养》，我只读过毛主席的书！伟大的中国共产党是毛主席亲手缔造的，毛泽东思想是党的灵魂、是党的生命，你们反对毛泽东思想，就是反党！反党的不是我，而是你们！”
    经过这场斗争，王忠珍弄清了好些问题。她向广大革命群众揭发了贵州省委内一小撮走资派通过“工作组”在白窑大队进行的种种罪恶活动，她同贫下中农一起把“工作组”赶出了白窑大队，并揪出了修文县党内一小撮走资派，进行了批判和斗争。
    站在斗争前列　保卫四清成果
    党内一小撮走资派为了挽救自己失败的命运，纠集农村中地富反坏分子，疯狂地进行反扑。他们说
  “四清”中那些犯有严重错误被撤职的干部是“受害者”，表示愿意给他们“平反”。他们以“造反”为幌子，把斗争矛头指向贫下中农和四清运动中成长起来的好的和比较好的干部，特别指向王忠珍。他们散布流言蜚语，说王忠珍是个跳了出来的“个人野心家、反革命集团的头目”，妄图破坏四清运动的伟大成果，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    保卫四清运动的伟大成果，就是保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。王忠珍在这场十分尖锐的阶级搏斗中，立场坚定，爱憎分明。
    有一段时间，每天都有人到王忠珍这里“造反”，这个要钱，那个要米，有的逼着给他“摘帽子”。王忠珍总是挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，坚定地回答他们说：“你们要翻案办不到，毛主席没有这样说，我不能干！”
    在阶级斗争尖锐的时刻，王忠珍想起了毛主席的教导：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
    怎样才能把真心实意拥护革命的群众组织起来呢？王忠珍反复思索着。她想：“千条万条，毛泽东思想是第一条；只有用毛泽东思想才能统一起群众的思想，才能组织起群众战胜敌人。”她首先把几个斗争最坚定的青年团结好。然后，他们以战斗的姿态继续组织贫下中农和民兵学习毛主席著作。他们用毛泽东思想去解决群众思想上的种种问题，同革命群众一起用阶级分析的方法去辨别什么人是革命派，什么人是走资派。这样，阶级阵线清楚了，革命群众同王忠珍的关系更加紧密了。
    有一次，王忠珍同民兵一起学习毛主席著作，有个同志对她说：“小王呀！敌人放风说不杀掉你，他们在白窑这个地方就落不住脚。”王忠珍听了说道：“无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级对资产阶级的你死我活的大搏斗，在这场斗争中，不可避免地会有流血牺牲。但是，我们的革命事业总是要按照毛主席指示的方向前进的，毛主席的革命路线是一定要胜利的！”大家听了说：“小王说的对！有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有强大的中国人民解放军做靠山，有贫下中农和民兵组成的铜墙铁壁，就是天塌下来，我们也能撑得住！”王忠珍翻开《毛主席语录》领着大家读道：“我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想。一切过高地估计敌人力量和过低地估计人民力量的观点，都是错误的。”“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”大家越学感到越有力量，他们就一起写大字报继续揭露党内一小撮走资派在农村大搞资本主义复辟的罪行。
    一个夜晚，细雨下个不停。白窑大队贫协副主席龙大伯在煤厂接班，听说阶级敌人已计划好当晚谋害王忠珍。他摸黑到各队寻找王忠珍。那天傍晚，王忠珍到最远的第五队布置工作，深夜十二点多了，独自一人往家走，在路上遇到了龙大伯。她听了龙大伯说的情况，心中非常激动，想道：龙大伯是个真心拥护革命的老贫农，龙大伯来保护我，是谁指挥他来的呢？是毛泽东思想啊！当他们走到一个岔口时，看见有几个黑影晃动，阶级敌人果然在等着她。世世代代的阶级仇恨一下子涌上王忠珍的心头，她厉声喝道：“深更半夜，你们在这里干什么！”龙大伯接着大声吼道：“你们这些坏家伙，当心我们贫下中农捶断你们的背脊骨！”那几个坏家伙一听有人保护着王忠珍，便拚命地往山上跑走了。
      掌握毛泽东思想所向无敌
    斗争并未结束。一天深夜里，在党内一小撮走资派的策划下，修文、开阳、息烽的地富反坏分子，笼络着一批外地人，找到王忠珍进行反攻倒算。王忠珍抬头望去，见不到本大队的贫下中农，心有些不踏实。想道：今晚会发生什么事情呢？她从衣袋里摸到了《毛主席语录》，立即镇定下来。她想：我不孤立，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想和我在一起，发生什么事情也不怕！
    几个地富反坏分子要王忠珍“低头认罪！”她把头抬得高高的说：“地富反坏右和走资派统统滚出去，共产党员在敌人面前是不低头的！”一个家伙油腔滑调地对她说：“哎呀！支书，你年纪轻，前途远大，只要检查了，站到我们这边来就算啦！”王忠珍一听，怒火冒起八丈高，她说：“我是个共产党员，毛主席教导我们：
  ‘对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。’我和你们站在一边，那我不是和敌人同流合污了吗？”这时，地富反坏分子唆使“四清”中犯过严重错误被撤职的干部逼迫王忠珍签字归还他们“四清”退赔物资，并且叫王忠珍“把权交出来！”
    在“权”字面前，王忠珍思潮滚滚，她谨记毛主席的教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”她想：无产阶级政权，这是革命的根本问题，贫下中农有了政权就有了一切，丧失政权，就丧失一切。毛主席为了我们贫下中农翻身掌大权，艰苦奋斗几十年，多少革命先烈流血牺牲，如果把权交给阶级敌人，我们贫下中农不知要有多少人人头落地。她斩钉截铁地说：“权是我们贫下中农的，就是把刀架在我的脖子上，我也不会交给你们！”
    白窑大队的贫下中农听说王忠珍被围攻，纷纷跑来支援。王忠珍高高举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，慷慨激昂地说：“有毛主席给我们撑腰，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯；有了毛泽东思想，我们敢与魔鬼争高下，敢在敌人面前逞英豪；有了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，人民江山得保障，革命红旗永飘扬。”接着王忠珍一针见血地指出，对她发动的这场围斗，是贵州省委内和修文地区一小撮走资派勾结地富反坏向贫下中农进行的反攻倒算。她拿起《毛主席语录》朗读道：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，……”白窑大队的贫下中农也唱起毛主席语录歌：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”光焰无际的毛泽东思想，驱散了阶级敌人散布的妖雾。阶级敌人策划的反革命倒算大会，成了审判敌人的大会，成了宣传毛泽东思想的大会。一小撮阶级敌人见势不妙，就逃之夭夭了。
    王忠珍劳动了一天，又战斗了一夜，当她一跨进家门，看见墙上挂的毛主席像时，情不自禁地流出了激动的热泪，她是多么地想把积压在心头的千言万语向毛主席他老人家倾吐啊！她长久地凝视着伟大领袖毛主席像，连声地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”这时，一轮红日从东方升起，王忠珍又扛起锄头，迎着朝阳，到田间同贫下中农一起劳动去了。
    经过激烈的阶级斗争，王忠珍和白窑大队的贫下中农，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，增强了阶级斗争观念。在建立贵州省革命委员会时，王忠珍被广大的无产阶级革命派和贫下中农一致推选为省革命委员会常委。
                            *　*　*
    王忠珍在担任了贵州省革委会常委以后，更加努力学习毛主席著作了。除日常工作以外，她经常到贵阳市附近生产队和本公社生产队参加劳动，听取群众意见，帮助群众解决问题，同贫下中农一起组织毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席著作，认真“斗私，批修”，进行革命的大批判。她决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派斗争到底；同时破私立公，彻底改造世界观，用伟大的毛泽东思想进一步把自己武装起来。
