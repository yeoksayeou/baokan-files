Plagiarizing the slogans of the proletariat to engage in deception and fraud is a trick that the decaying bourgeoisie and their agents are accustomed to playing. Lenin once sarcastically ridiculed the old revisionist parties, saying: "Such a 'bourgeois workers' party,' wherever Marxism is welcomed by the workers, will swear by Marx's name. It is impossible to prevent them from doing so, just as it is impossible to prevent a business from using any trademark, sign, or advertisement."

The Soviet revisionist clique is an old hand at playing this trick. Recently, their warehouse of lies has added new items. They blather on about how the Soviet Union has "established a new socialist ideology in all spheres of social spiritual life."

The enemy of proletarian dictatorship has become the establisher of "socialist ideology." This is a monstrous lie!

Today, in the Soviet Union, which class's ideology dominates the realm of thought and culture? Once the tattered fig leaf of the Soviet revisionist traitors is torn away, the truth will be fully revealed.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. After the Soviet revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the party and the state, they further tightly grasped the important battlefield of class struggle in culture and art, using it as a tool for the comprehensive restoration of capitalism. To this end, they have recruited a large number of reactionary literati, hoodlum poets, traitors, bourgeois reactionary "authorities," and various kinds of revisionist elements. For example, the infamous Soviet literary patriarch Sholokhov is an enemy of the Soviet regime, a traitor to the people's war, and a loyal lackey of imperialism, but he is highly favored. After the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, he suddenly became a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU, a deputy of the Supreme Soviet, and the secretary of the Union of Soviet Writers. The old right-wing literati Ilya Ehrenburg viciously attacked proletarian dictatorship as a "cold winter" and raved about "thawing." The counter-revolutionary two-faced, despicable scoundrel Simonov raved about the "persecution" of proletarian dictatorship. It is these old counter-revolutionaries who have been appointed as executive members of the Union of Soviet Writers.

Moreover, the Soviet revisionist clique, fearing that they might die out, have, under the pretext of "promoting new talented writers," elevated some new bourgeois intellectuals to leadership "thrones." The extremely reactionary and vulgar poet and gambler Yevtushenko has become a new star and a red-hot figure in the Soviet revisionist literary world.

Today, the leadership of the state machinery and the realm of thought and culture in the Soviet Union is entirely in the hands of the bourgeois representatives led by the Soviet revisionist leadership. They will inevitably spread the poison of bourgeois ideology and transform the world according to the bourgeois worldview, while not allowing the spread of proletarian thought and socialist ideology.

Under the pretext of "modernization," "liberalization," and "realism," the Soviet revisionist clique arbitrarily labels works that depict the great achievements of proletarian dictatorship and the new socialist life as "dishonest" and "whitewashing life"; they viciously denounce works that create the images of heroes who emerged in the revolution and construction as "cold political preaching"; and they slander works that praise the great leader of the proletariat as promoting "cult of personality." They openly declare that the heroes such as Pavel Korchagin created in Gorky's "Mother" and Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered" are "outdated." In today's Soviet Union, songs praising the great revolutionary leaders and the revolutionary struggle have disappeared, and films and other literary works that reflect the glorious revolutionary history of the Soviet Union, expose the brutality and deception of imperialism, and depict the heroic struggle of the Soviet Red Army have all been wantonly destroyed and suppressed by the Soviet revisionist clique.

Hating the proletariat and socialism means loving the bourgeoisie and capitalism. The Soviet revisionist clique and a small group of their literary lackeys are frantically peddling capitalist and revisionist black goods, singing the praises of anti-communist and anti-people traitors, erecting monuments and writing biographies, and opening the green light to Western culture and the American way of life.

They vigorously promote the reactionary idea of money worship and vulgar, obscene tastes of the bourgeoisie. Soviet revisionist publications openly feature posters with the ruble as the main attraction. Soviet cinemas across the country screen a large number of vulgar and obscene films such as "Love in April," "Love in September," "Love on Page 104," and so on.

They vigorously promote pacifism, advocate the philosophy of survival, and oppose revolutionary war. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, novels such as Sholokhov's "The Fate of a Man," Simonov's "The Living and the Dead," and films such as "Soldier's Song," "Ivan's Childhood," and "Flight of the Geese" were released one after another, all of which vividly depict the horrors of war, cursing all wars as "murdering the future of mankind, youth, and tomorrow of our planet," advocating survival at all costs, even if it means "lying on the ground, crying for mercy," or "raising your hands" to become a traitor, you "should live on"...

Look, what a shocking capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration! It is the Soviet revisionist clique that has turned the realm of thought and culture in the Soviet Union into a world of weeds, mold, demons, and mist.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "A certain culture (as an ideological form of culture) is a reflection of the politics and economics of a certain society, and it also has a great influence and effect on the politics and economics of a certain society."

The establishment of bourgeois ideology in the realm of thought and culture by the Soviet revisionist clique is a necessary requirement and reflection of their political bourgeois dictatorship and the restoration of the capitalist exploitation system; at the same time, it is also completely for the purpose of deceiving, enslaving the people, corrupting the revolutionary will of the people, and consolidating the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie.

When the Communist Manifesto was published in 1848, some European landlord bourgeoisie frantically waved the banner of "communism" and peddled fake communism. However, when people discovered that their buttocks were stamped with old feudal seals, they laughed and walked away. Today, the Soviet revisionist clique peddles capitalist goods but sticks socialist labels on them, which will definitely be seen through by the Soviet people. No matter what tricks the Soviet revisionist clique plays, they cannot stop the Soviet people from rising up in revolution, overthrowing the reactionary rule of revisionism, and bringing the Soviet Union back to the socialist path.

    撕下苏修骗子的遮羞布
    巴山
    抄袭无产阶级的口号进行招摇撞骗，这是没落的资产阶级及其代理人惯于玩弄的鬼把戏。列宁曾经辛辣地讽刺老修正主义政党说：“这种‘资产阶级工人政党’，在马克思主义受到工人欢迎的一切地方，都会拿马克思的名字赌咒发誓。要禁止他们这样做是不可能的，正如不能禁止一个商号使用任何一种商标、招牌和广告一样。”
    苏修叛徒集团是玩弄这套伎俩的老手。在他们的谎言仓库中最近又增添了新的货色。他们胡说什么：苏联已经“在社会精神生活的一切领域内确立新的社会主义意识形态”了。
    无产阶级专政的死敌居然成了“社会主义意识形态”的确立者。这真是弥天大谎！
    今天的苏联，究竟是哪个阶级的意识形态统治了思想文化领域？只要撕下苏修叛徒的破烂不堪的遮羞布，真相就完全大白。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。苏修集团篡夺了党和国家的领导之后，就进一步把文化艺术这个阶级斗争的重要阵地紧紧地掌握在自己手里，作为全面复辟资本主义的工具。为此，他们招降纳叛，结党营私，网罗了大批反动文人、阿飞诗人、叛徒、资产阶级反动“权威”和形形色色的修正主义分子。例如，臭名远扬的苏修文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫，是苏维埃政权的死敌，人民战争的叛徒，帝国主义的忠实奴才，但却备受青睐，苏共二十二大以后一跃成为苏共中央委员、最高苏维埃代表、全苏作协书记。老牌右派文人爱伦堡恶毒攻击无产阶级专政是“阴冷的冬天”，疯狂叫嚣“解冻”。反革命两面派、卑鄙无耻的文人西蒙诺夫，疯狂咒骂无产阶级专政是“迫害”。就是这些老反革命，被钦定为全苏作协执行委员。
    不仅如此，苏修集团生怕绝了种，还以“提拔新的富有才华的作家”为名，把一些新的资产阶级知识分子捧上了领导“宝座”。反动透顶的下流诗人、赌棍叶夫图申科，成为苏修黑文坛的新贵和红得发紫的名角。
    今日苏联的国家机器以及思想文化领域的领导权，既然统统把持在以苏修领导集团为首的资产阶级代表人物手里，他们就必然要大肆散布资产阶级思想的毒素，按照资产阶级世界观来改造世界，而决不允许无产阶级思想和社会主义意识形态的传播。
    苏修集团在“现代化”、“自由化”、“写真实”的幌子下，把描绘无产阶级专政的伟大成就和社会主义新生活的作品，蛮横地加上“不诚实”、“粉饰生活”等等的罪名；把塑造革命和建设中涌现出的英雄人物形象的作品，咬牙切齿地大骂为“冷冰冰的政治说教”；把歌颂无产阶级伟大领袖的作品，诬蔑为宣扬“个人迷信”。他们公开宣布：高尔基的《母亲》、奥斯特洛夫斯基的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》所塑造的保尔·柯察金等英雄人物“已经过时了”。在今天的苏联，歌唱伟大的革命领袖、歌唱革命斗争的歌曲消失了，反映苏联光荣革命历史、揭露帝国主义残暴和欺骗、表现苏联红军英勇奋斗的影片和其他文艺作品，都受到了苏修叛徒集团的恣意摧残和扼杀。
    对无产阶级和社会主义充满了恨，对资产阶级和资本主义就必定充满了爱。苏修集团及其在文艺界的一小撮御用文人，疯狂贩卖资本主义、修正主义的黑货，为反共反人民的叛徒歌功颂德，树碑立传，向西方文化和美国生活方式大开绿灯，剪彩开闸。
    他们竭力宣扬资产阶级的金钱万能的反动思想和庸俗淫荡的下流趣味。苏修报刊上公然出现卢布挂帅的招贴画。苏修各地的影院大量上演什么《四月里的爱情》、《九月里的爱情》、《一○四页爱情》……等等下流庸俗的影片。
    他们大肆宣扬和平主义，鼓吹活命哲学，反对革命战争。苏共二十大后，肖洛霍夫的小说《一个人的遭遇》、西蒙诺夫的《生者与死者》、丘赫拉依的影片《士兵之歌》以及影片《伊万的童年》、《雁南飞》等大毒草相继出笼，大肆渲染战争恐怖，咒骂一切战争都是“对人类的未来，对青春，对我们星球的明天的谋杀”，鼓吹一切为了“活着”，哪怕是“趴在地上，哭着乞求”，哪怕是“举起手来”当叛徒，也“应该活下去”……。
    看，这是何等触目惊心的资本主义反革命复辟！正是苏修集团把苏联的思想文化领域变成了毒草丛生，霉菌遍地，群魔乱舞，妖雾弥漫的世界。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济”。
    苏修集团在思想文化领域内建立资产阶级意识形态的统治，是他们在政治上实行资产阶级专政，经济上复辟资本主义剥削制度的必然要求和反映；同时，反过来，又完全是为他们欺骗、奴役人民，腐蚀人民的革命意志，巩固资产阶级的反动统治服务的。
    一八四八年《共产党宣言》问世时，欧洲的一些地主资产阶级曾经拚命挥舞“共产主义”的旗帜，贩卖假共产主义。然而当人们发现它们的臀部盖有老旧的封建印章，就哗然不恭、哈哈大笑地走开了。今天，苏修叛徒集团贩卖资本主义的货色，却贴上社会主义的标签，这是一定要被苏联人民看穿的。苏修叛徒集团不论玩弄什么把戏，都不能阻止苏联人民起来革命，推翻修正主义的反动统治，使苏联重新回到社会主义道路上来。
