Our unit, like those across the country, has undergone tremendous changes during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolution is thriving, and production is booming.

However, during a previous period, due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the influence of anti-governmental and anarchist ideologies from reactionary elements in society, our brigade also experienced instances of not adhering to labor discipline. Some individuals believed that all past rules and regulations were revisionist and could be disregarded. Some people came to work whenever they felt like it and left whenever they wanted, even justifying such anarchist behavior as "liberating oneself." Although these incorrect actions were committed by only a few individuals, they disrupted the entire brigade's labor discipline. The majority of the brigade members unanimously demanded that this phenomenon be swiftly corrected.

With the help of the PLA comrades, all the workers in our brigade studied the "Three Articles" and the letter from the Central Committee, personally approved by Chairman Mao, to the coal industry workers. Through study and discussion, we realized that "grasp revolution, promote production" is the battle cry issued by our great leader Chairman Mao, and "maintaining an eight-hour workday" and "completing the national plan efficiently, quickly, and economically" are the requirements set by the Party Central Committee for all workers. We must resolutely respond to and implement the words of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Grasp the revolution and promote production; this is in the best interest of all the people and is also the urgent demand of all workers. However, the class enemies are not asleep; they are always trying to sabotage our revolution and production, using anarchist thoughts within our ranks to disrupt the revolutionary order of the proletariat. We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, must see through the enemy's tricks and smash their sabotage activities.

After such study and discussion, the ideological understanding of all comrades in the brigade has been elevated. On this basis, each of our teams has drafted labor agreements and proposed initiatives to all the workers in the mine, asking all revolutionary workers to supervise us. Now, everyone in our brigade studies Chairman Mao's works and adheres to labor discipline. Our organization and discipline have greatly improved, the revolutionary criticism movement is developing well, and production plans are being completed month by month.

    社会主义劳动纪律必须遵守
    我们这里在无产阶级文化大革命中和全国各地一样，发生了天翻地覆的变化，革命轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。
    但是前一个时期，由于党内一小撮走资派和社会上地富反坏右分子的煽动，加上无政府主义思潮的影响，我们队里也出现过不遵守劳动纪律的现象。有个别人认为过去的一切规章制度都是修正主义的，都可以不遵守。有的人上班想来就来，说走就走，还把这种无政府主义行为说成是“自己解放自己”。这种错误行动虽然发生在个别人身上，却破坏了全队劳动纪律。广大队员一致要求迅速纠正这种现象。
    在解放军同志的帮助下，我们队里全体职工学习了“老三篇”，又学习了毛主席亲自批准的中央《给煤炭工业战线职工的信》。经过学习讨论，我们认识到：“抓革命，促生产”是伟大领袖毛主席发出的战斗号令，“坚持八小时工作制”“多快好省地完成国家计划”是党中央对广大职工提出的要求。毛主席和党中央的话，我们要坚决响应，坚决照办。抓好革命，促好生产，是全国人民的最大利益，也是我们广大职工的迫切要求。但是阶级敌人并没有睡觉，他们每时每刻都在企图破坏我们的革命和生产，利用我们队伍里的无政府主义思想，破坏无产阶级的革命秩序。我们无产阶级革命派，必须识破敌人的阴谋诡计，粉碎敌人的破坏活动。
    这样一学习一讨论，全队同志的思想认识都提高了一步。在这个基础上，我们各个班组酝酿制定了劳动公约，并且向全矿职工提出倡议，让全矿革命职工一起来监督我们。现在我们队里人人学习毛主席著作，个个遵守劳动纪律，组织性和纪律性大大加强，革命的大批判活动开展得很好，生产也月月完成计划。
