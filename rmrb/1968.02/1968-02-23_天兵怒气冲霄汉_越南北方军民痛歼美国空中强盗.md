The Heavenly Soldiers' Fury Pierces the Heavens
— The Military and People of North Vietnam Severely Defeat American Air Pirates

Since August 5, 1964, the heroic military and people of North Vietnam have been fighting against American air pirates for more than three years. The American imperialists, who have always boasted of having "air superiority," have been relentlessly bombing North Vietnam day and night. However, they have not been able to conquer the heroic people on this heroic land. Instead, they have suffered unprecedented heavy losses. Up to now, more than 2,700 American planes have been shot down.

The Paper Tiger's True Colors Exposed

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All the reactionaries are paper tigers." The American imperialists have been beaten to a pulp on the battlefield in South Vietnam, already revealing their true colors as paper tigers. The military and people of North Vietnam have been fighting fiercely with the American air pirates for three years, similarly exposing the true colors of this paper tiger!

People remember that when the American air pirates first started attacking North Vietnam, the American imperialists were so arrogant and aggressive! They often sent out large numbers of planes to madly bomb targets on the transportation lines, sometimes even hovering at an altitude of just over a hundred meters. On April 3 and 4, 1965, the military and people of Thanh Hoa Province shot down dozens of invading American planes in just two days using rifles, machine guns, and anti-aircraft guns. The "Thunderchief," "Phantom," "Magic," and "Skyhawk" jet planes that the American imperialists boasted about were left with half a head, one wing, or countless fragments, falling in large numbers on both sides of the Ma River. The military and people of Thanh Hoa Province were elated, describing this glorious battle as "hunting wild ducks."

After this, the American pirate planes dared not fly low or dive-bomb so easily.

The more fiercely the American pirates "escalated," the greater their failures became. According to statistics: the number of enemy planes invading North Vietnam averaged about 200 sorties per day in 1966, increased to 300 to 400 sorties per day in 1967, and reached as high as 700 sorties on the busiest day. However, in proportion to the increase in the number of enemy plane sorties, the number of American planes shot down by the military and people of North Vietnam also "escalated": 773 planes were shot down in 1966, and 1,067 planes were shot down in 1967. Especially since the American air pirates intensified their attacks on Hanoi, Haiphong, and the transportation lines along the Vietnam-China border, their failures have become even more severe. In the second half of last year, the average number of American planes shot down per month exceeded 105. The types of enemy planes shot down in various places also increased, with the military and people of the Fourth Military Region alone shooting down 22 types of American planes. The number of American air pirates killed and captured has also been increasing, including American air force officers of various ranks, from lieutenants to a U.S. Air Force colonel responsible for commanding 72 planes. A Vietnamese comrade introduced a very ironic story: just as enemy planes were being shot down by the hundreds each month, the American imperialists specially selected a "most experienced" air force colonel to personally fly a plane to the skies over North Vietnam to study methods of dealing with the ground fire of the Vietnamese people. Unexpectedly, his "mission" was not completed, and he himself was captured alive by the Vietnamese military and people.

In 1967, the American imperialists sent out their "last trump card" aircraft—the B-52 strategic bomber—to attack North Vietnam. When this type of plane took off, there were always dozens of fighter planes escorting it, and the flying altitude was generally above 8,000 meters. However, the Vietnamese military and people, who were becoming more experienced in combat, still shot them down.

From the supersonic "Thunderchief" and "Phantom" to the U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance planes and B-52 strategic bombers, their consecutive shoot-downs marked the complete collapse of the myth of American imperialism's boasted "air superiority."

Revolutionary War is a Great School

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "For revolutionary people, learning war from war—this is our main method." In the fierce struggle against American air pirates, the military and people of North Vietnam have produced countless heroes who have grown and tempered in the fires of war.

On the artillery positions of the Vietnamese People's Army, there are many young soldiers with various medals on their chests. Not long ago, they were still students, workers, and members of agricultural cooperatives. With a burning desire to kill the enemy, they joined the people's army and, in the fierce battles, became excellent gunners and achieved brilliant victories.

The 14th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, which was awarded the title of "Heroic Unit," is such a heroic unit. In this anti-aircraft artillery battalion, 90% of the cadres joined after 1963, and two-thirds of the soldiers are new recruits. They resolutely responded to the battle call of the great leader President Ho Chi Minh, showing extraordinary bravery. The second gunner Nguyen The Dao continued to fight even after being injured. The cook Du Van Vinh, in one battle, took over the position of the injured fourth gunner and fought brilliantly. Shrapnel hit his left arm, but he ignored it and continued to fight, not letting his comrades who were fully engaged in striking the enemy planes know. The fifth gunner was hit in the neck by enemy shrapnel just before the battle was won. When he died heroically, his hands were tightly holding the shell, and his body was leaning on the gun carriage, still in a fighting posture.

In the first two years of the anti-American resistance war, this anti-aircraft artillery battalion has been fighting in many of the most intense battlefields in North Vietnam, enduring countless hardships, marching 120,000 kilometers, fighting bravely more than 400 times, and shooting down 93 American pirate planes.

This heroic unit, like other brother units, has been tempered and grown in the fires of battle. They pool their wisdom, summarize their experiences, concentrate their firepower on the enemy, and fight fiercely and accurately. If they do not fight, they do not fight; if they fight, they fight to the death.

The Vietnamese people, like the people's army, have also grown rapidly in the revolutionary war. The militia of Yen An Province's Yen Thinh Commune, at the beginning, did not understand much about American modern weapons and were not used to the strange sounds made by enemy planes when they dive-bombed. However, the hatred for the American aggressors, who are sworn enemies, made the people of North Vietnam bravely join the battle to strike the American air pirates. The entire commune of 447 militia members fought continuously for 38 times in four months to defend a certain bridge, gaining more and more experience. They once used rifles and light machine guns to shoot down two American planes.

The militia of Van Ze Commune, Bu Ze District, Binh Thuan Province, did not shoot down any enemy planes in the early stages of the battle, while the militia of several nearby communes had already achieved victories, and they were very anxious. Soon, they summarized their experiences and moved their positions to the side of the area where the enemy planes concentrated their bombing. "Lure the enemy planes to attack!" was their battle slogan. They fought bravely against the enemy. Once, an enemy plane launched a rocket, setting the militia platoon leader Nguyen Thanh Tiem's hair on fire. He immediately put his head in the water to extinguish the fire and returned to the position to continue fighting. In the battle, they fought more and more fiercely. The militia of this commune has fought against enemy planes more than 123 times and, in one week, used rifles to shoot down two enemy planes. One of the American jet planes, they shot down with only two rifle bullets, falling just one kilometer away from their position. The American air pirate was burned alive in the cockpit before he could even jump out!

The Roads Cannot Be Cut Off, The Bridges Cannot Be Destroyed

Between Hanoi and the 17th Parallel, there is a section of road that has been bombed into a muddy mess by enemy planes. At a glance, it is indistinguishable from the adjacent white rice fields. One day, a certain artillery unit's 18 military vehicles, carrying a platoon of soldiers and several cannons, passed through here and were stuck in the muddy road. After the news spread, people within a few kilometers gathered, bringing axes, ropes, shovels, and baskets from all directions. Within half an hour, more than 300 people gathered. Those who cut wood, those who dug stones, those who transported, those who filled the road, and those who pulled the cars all worked together on this muddy section of road in a tense and arduous labor. The artillery platoon leader said to everyone: "The frontline is waiting for us! We must pull all the military vehicles through the muddy road in four rounds." Every villager who was repairing the road realized: time is life, speed is victory! They shouted slogans, worked hard, and fought continuously for more than ten hours.

Later, the road became even more muddy, and repairing it became even more difficult. When the enemy planes came, they fired a series of flares on the road, illuminating the dark night like daylight. Under these circumstances, the military and people displayed their unyielding fighting spirit of not fearing fatigue and fighting continuously, using the gradually weakening light of the flares to pull four more military vehicles through.

The artillery platoon leader saw that everyone was exhausted and suggested resting for a while. However, everyone did not want to rest. The female youth of the Chen Shi Li road repair team gathered together and came up with a good idea: use battle songs to inspire everyone's enthusiasm, add a little more effort, and strive to pull the last three military vehicles through before dawn. Soon, from the grassy area not far from the muddy road, the songs "Liberate the South" and "March of Liberation" were sung. People heard the songs, their spirits were boosted, and their enthusiasm doubled. After another two hours of continuous fighting, all the military vehicles finally safely passed through the muddy road.

Ten days later, the Chen Shi Li road repair team received a letter of thanks from the soldiers on Hon Giao Island. The letter said that this artillery unit, which passed through the muddy road, arrived at the position in just ten minutes and engaged in a fierce battle with the American pirates. They used the weapons that had just been transported there to sink an enemy ship and shoot down an American plane.

On the land of Vietnam, there are thousands of road repair teams like the Chen Shi Li road repair team, who regard supporting the frontline and bravely fighting the enemy as their sacred mission. Many elderly people in North Vietnam do not hesitate to dismantle the doors of their homes and cut down the trees they have cultivated for many years to build bridges and roads. Fishermen who are about to set sail hear that the enemy planes have bombed the bridges and give up their boats to build ferries, ensuring that cars are not obstructed. Tens of thousands of families store road-building clay, and as soon as the battle ends, they voluntarily carry the clay to the bombed sites to repair the roads. The Vietnamese people have great creativity. A bridge not far from Yen An was bombed, and thousands of local people immediately rushed to repair it. Half an hour later, vehicles were crossing the bridge again and continuing to move forward.

Indomitable Hon Market

Hon Market has always been a key area for American planes to bomb and enemy ships to shell. The brave and indomitable people of Hon Market have fought tenaciously against the enemy.

At the beginning of last year, the military and people of Hon Market had already shot down more than 100 American planes, making it the city with the most enemy planes shot down in North Vietnam at that time. From the city to the suburbs, the people have been fighting and producing, and working everywhere, shining with the glory of people's war. Whether it is day or night, the power plant continues to generate electricity, and the wired broadcasts continue to broadcast news of victory and battle songs. According to Comrade Ho Van Dai, the propaganda department head of the Hon Market City Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party, the American imperialists bombed Hon Market more than 600 times in the first two years, dropping more than 10,000 bombs and launching thousands of rockets and missiles. However, the people of Hon Market persisted in fighting while producing, and many factories and the city's handicraft industry still overfulfilled the 1966 production plan.

There is a "Viet Strong" machinery factory in Hon Market. Originally, it was a pile of rubble. However, the brave workers set up the factory here.

From the outside, the factory looks very simple, but inside, it is quite impressive. The dazzling electric welding sparks, and the workers operate normally next to the machines equipped with 200 photoelectric lamps. They use tinplate to make horn-shaped light shields, concentrating the light on the machines, which is beneficial for production and air defense. Once, when the enemy planes came to bomb, the bombs fell just 20 meters away from the factory, but the workers remained unmoved and continued to produce for the victory of the battle.

It is this machinery factory, which is becoming stronger in the war, that has set up "three preparations" to ensure that production can continue under any circumstances. As long as the power plant can still supply electricity, they will continue to use the electricity from the city to maintain production, which is the first preparation; if the city's power supply is cut off, they will immediately use the factory's own diesel generator to generate electricity, which is the second preparation; even if the diesel generator is also damaged, they have already prepared a hand-cranked generator that can generate electricity by shaking the tracks, which is the third preparation.

No matter how fiercely the American imperialists bomb, the indomitable Hon Market is still a vibrant scene. People who see the revolutionary spirit of the people of Hon Market fighting while working naturally come to the conclusion: the bombs of American imperialism cannot frighten the heroic Vietnamese people. The 31 million people of Vietnam will definitely completely defeat the American invaders and achieve the final victory in the anti-American resistance war.

### 天兵怒气冲霄汉——越南北方军民痛歼美国空中强盗

    天兵怒气冲霄汉
    ——越南北方军民痛歼美国空中强盗
    从一九六四年八月五日以来，英雄的越南北方军民反击美国空中强盗的斗争，已经持续三年多了。一向吹嘘拥有“空中优势”的美帝国主义，不分昼夜地对越南北方进行狂轰滥炸，但它征服不了英雄土地上的英雄人民，相反地遭到了空前惨重的失败。到最近为止，已有二千七百多架美国飞机被打得粉身碎骨。
    纸老虎原形毕露
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎”。美帝国主义在南越战场上被打得落花流水，已经显出了它的纸老虎的原形。越南北方军民同美国空中强盗进行了三年激烈的搏斗，同样用事实戳穿了美帝国主义这只纸老虎！
    人们记得，当美国空中强盗刚刚开始进攻越南北方的时候，美帝国主义是多么张牙舞爪，嚣张一时！它经常出动大批飞机，疯狂地对交通线上的目标俯冲轰炸，有时竟在一百多米的低空盘旋。一九六五年四月三日和四日清化军民在两天之内，就用步枪、机关枪和高射炮，击落几十架入侵的美国飞机。美帝国主义大肆吹嘘的“雷公”、“鬼怪”、“魔术师”、“空中之鹰”等类型的喷气式飞机，有的剩下半个脑袋，有的留下一个翅膀，有的变成数不清的碎片，一大批一大批地坠落在马江两岸。清化军民扬眉吐气，把这场战果辉煌的战斗形容为“象猎人打野鸭子一样”。
    从这以后，美国强盗飞机不敢轻易低飞俯冲了。
    美国强盗越是疯狂“升级”，遭到的失败也就越大。据统计：入侵越南北方的敌机，一九六六年平均每天约有二百架次左右，一九六七年则增加到三百至四百架次，最多一天达到七百架次。但是，同敌机入侵架次的增加成正比例，越南北方军民击落的美国飞机也同样“升级”：一九六六年击落七百七十三架，一九六七年击落一千零六十七架。特别是美国空中强盗加紧袭击河内、海防和中越边界交通线以来，它们遭到的失败更加惨重。去年下半年，平均每月被击落的美国飞机超过了一百零五架。各地击落的敌机类型也增多了，仅第四军区军民就击落了二十二种类型的美国飞机。击毙和活捉的美国飞贼也越来越多，其中包括美国各级空军军官，从尉官到负责指挥七十二架飞机的美国空军上校。越南同志介绍了一个很有讽刺意义的故事：正当敌机每月成百架地被击落的时候，美帝国主义特地选派了一名“最有经验”的空军上校，亲自驾驶飞机来到越南北方上空，专门研究对付越南人民地面火力的办法，没有想到，“使命”还没有来得及完成，他自己却被越南军民活捉了。
    一九六七年，美帝国主义出动了它的“最后一张王牌”飞机——B—52型战略轰炸机袭击越南北方。当这种飞机出动的时候，每次都有十几架到几十架战斗机护航，飞行高度一般都在八千米以上，但是，越战越有经验的越南军民照样把它揍了下来。
    从超音速的“雷公”、“鬼怪”到U—2型高空侦察机和B—52型战略轰炸机的接连被击落，标志着美帝国主义大肆吹嘘的“空中优势”的神话彻底破产了。
    革命战争是个伟大的学校
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：对于革命人民，“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”越南北方军民在同美国空中强盗的激烈搏斗中，涌现出无数英雄人物，他们在战争的烈火中锻炼成长起来。
    在越南人民军的炮兵阵地上，有许多胸前佩戴着各种奖章的年轻战士。不久以前，他们还是学生、工人和农业合作社社员。他们怀着杀敌的怒火，加入了人民军，在激烈的战斗中，变成了优秀的炮手，立下了辉煌的战功。
    荣获英雄单位称号的阮曰春第十四高炮营，就是这样的一支英雄部队。在这个高炮营里，百分之九十的干部是一九六三年以后入伍的，三分之二的战士是新兵。他们坚决响应伟大领袖胡志明主席的战斗号召，表现了非凡的英勇。二炮手阮廷道，受伤后仍然坚持战斗。炊事员窦文永，在一次战斗中主动接替受伤的四号炮手，战斗得非常出色，炸弹片打进他的左臂，他不理睬，继续战斗，不让正在全力打击敌机的战友们知道。五号炮手在战斗取得胜利前不久，被敌人的弹片打中脖子，当他壮烈牺牲的时候，双手紧抱着炮弹，身体伏在炮架上，仍然是一副战斗的英姿。
    在抗美救国斗争的头两年里，这个高炮营一直是在越南北方战斗最激烈的许多战场机动作战，历尽千辛万苦，行军十二万公里，英勇战斗四百多次，击落了九十三架美国强盗飞机。
    这支英雄的部队，同其他兄弟部队一样，是在战斗的烈火中锻炼成长的。他们群策群力，经过不断的总结，打敌机火力集中，又猛又准，不打则已，一打就是一场歼灭战。
    越南人民也象人民军一样，在革命战争中迅速地成长起来了。义安省演成乡民兵，在开始的时候，有些人对美国现代化武器还不摸底，对于敌机俯冲时发出的怪叫声还不习惯。但是，对美国侵略强盗的不共戴天的仇恨，使越南北方的人民英勇无畏地投入了打击美国空中强盗的战斗。演成乡全乡四百四十七个民兵，在保卫某桥的战斗中，四个月连续作战三十八次，经验一次比一次丰富。他们曾用步枪和轻机枪击落两架美国飞机。
    广平省布泽县万泽乡的民兵，在开始战斗的一段时间里，没有能够击落敌机，而附近几个乡的民兵都已立下了战功，他们很着急。不久，他们总结了经验，把阵地搬到敌机重点轰炸地区的旁边。“引来敌机打！”就是他们的战斗口号。他们英勇杀敌。有一次，敌机发射火箭，烧着了民兵排长阮庭暹的头发，他立即把头钻进水里，灭了火，又回到阵地继续战斗。在战斗中越打越猛。这个乡的民兵已经同敌机战斗过一百二十三次以上，并且在一个星期内，用步枪击落两架敌机。其中一架美国喷气式飞机，他们只花了两发步枪子弹就把它当场击落，坠落在离他们阵地只有一公里的地方，那个美国飞贼还来不及跳伞就在座舱里活活地被烧死了！
    切不断的路　炸不垮的桥
    从河内到十七度线之间，有一段公路被敌机炸成了烂泥地。一眼望去，同旁边的白水田一模一样，分不出那里是田，那里是路。有一天，开赴前线的炮兵某部十八辆军车，载着一个排的战士和大炮多门，路过这里，被烂泥路卡住了。消息传开以后，附近几公里内外的群众，闻风而动，拿起砍刀、绳索，铁锹、箩筐，从四面八方涌来。半小时内就集中了三百多人。伐木的，采石的，装运的，填路的，拉车的，军民齐心协力，在这段烂泥地上进行一场紧张艰苦的劳动。炮兵排长对大家说：“前线正等待着我们！我们必须在四个回合之内，把全部军车拉过烂泥地。”修路的每一个老乡都意识到：时间就是生命，速度就是胜利！他们喊着口号，鼓足干劲，连续战斗了十多个小时。……
    到后来，路更烂了，修路更加艰难。敌机来了，在公路上空打了一串照明弹，把漆黑的夜晚照得象白天一样。在这种情况下，军民发扬不怕疲劳，连续作战的顽强的战斗精神，利用渐渐减弱的照明弹的光，又拉过去四辆军车。
    炮兵排长看到大家累极了，提议就地休息一会。可是，大家不肯休息。陈氏里修路组的女青年，十几个人围在一起，商量出一个好办法：用战斗的歌声鼓舞大家的干劲，再加一把力，争取在天亮前拉完最后三辆军车。顷刻，从离烂泥地不远的草坪上，唱出了《解放南方》、《解放进行曲》等雄壮的歌曲。人们听到歌声，精神振奋，干劲倍增。又经过两个小时的连续战斗，全部军车终于安全地通过了烂泥地。
    十天以后，陈氏里修路组收到来自昏果岛战士的一封感谢信。信上说，这支从烂泥地通过的炮兵部队，到达阵地才十分钟，就同美国强盗进行了一场激战，他们使用刚运去的武器，击沉了一艘敌舰，击落了一架美国飞机。
    在越南土地上，有千百个陈氏里修路组那样的战斗集体，他们把支援前线英勇杀敌作为自己的神圣任务。越南北方许多白发老人，不惜拆掉家里的门板，砍掉亲手培植多年的杨树，用来搭桥铺路。正在扬帆出发的渔民，听说敌机炸断了桥梁，自己让出船只拼搭渡船，保证汽车不被阻塞。成千上万的人家储备着筑路的粘土，每当战斗结束后，他们立刻主动地把粘土挑到被炸地点去修路。越南人民有伟大的创造力。离义安不远的一座桥被炸坏了，当地成千的人民立即抢修，半小时后，车辆又穿越桥梁，继续前进。
    不屈的荣市
    荣市一直是美国飞机轰炸和敌舰炮击的重点地区。英勇不屈的荣市人民跟敌人进行了英勇顽强的战斗。
    去年年初，荣市军民已经击落一百多架美国飞机，成为当时越南北方击落敌机最多的城市。从市区到郊区，人民一直坚持战斗，坚持生产，坚持工作，到处闪烁着人民战争的光辉。不论是白天还是黑夜，发电厂照常发电，有线广播不断播送出胜利的消息和战斗的歌声。据越南劳动党荣市市委宣传部长何文待同志介绍，美帝国主义在头两年内对荣市进行了六百多次轰炸，投下了万颗以上的炸弹，发射了数千枚火箭和导弹，但是荣市人民坚持边战斗边生产，许多工厂和全市的手工业仍然超额完成了一九六六年的生产计划。
    在荣市有个“越强”机器厂。这里原来是一片瓦砾堆。但是，英勇无畏的工人，就在这里办起了工厂。
    从外面看起来，工厂的样子很简陋，走进去一看，却是很象样，刺眼的电焊闪闪发光，工人们照常在装着二百支光电灯的机器旁操作。他们利用洋铁皮制成喇叭式的遮光筒，把灯光集中到机器上，既有利于生产，又有利于防空。有一次，敌机来轰炸，炸弹落在离工厂二十米的地方，但工人们岿然不动，为了战斗的胜利，继续坚持生产。
    就是这个在战火中越战越强的机器厂，为了保证生产在任何情况下都能进行，他们设立了“三套准备”。只要发电厂仍能供电，就继续利用来自市内的电力坚持生产，这是第一套准备；如果市内的电源断了，立即用工厂自备的柴油机发电，这是第二套准备；即使柴油机也被炸坏，他们已经备好手摇机，可以摇动履带发电，这是第三套准备。
    不管美帝国主义怎样狂轰滥炸，不屈的荣市仍然是一片生气勃勃的景象。人们看了荣市人民边战斗边工作的革命精神，很自然地得出结论：美帝国主义的炸弹，是吓不倒英雄的越南人民的。越南三千一百万人民必定要彻底打败美国侵略者，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
