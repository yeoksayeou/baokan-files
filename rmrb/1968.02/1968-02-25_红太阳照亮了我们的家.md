After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," we immediately convened a family meeting to study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest directive. By the end of November 1967, our family had started a Mao Zedong Thought study class.

Chairman Mao's latest directive to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" is like giving us a microscope. With this weapon, we see clearly. No matter what happens, we first use it to examine whether it is "public" or "selfish." Since our family started the study class, everyone has taken up this weapon. Every day, if anyone has a trace of "selfishness," they can't escape the eyes of the family. For example, during the 1967 settlement and distribution, my second son, Zhang Wanyuan, suddenly proposed to split the family with his older brother. His reason was: our family has more than ten people, if we are counted as one household, we can only get one share of firewood; if we split the family, we can get two shares of firewood. In 1967, our area had a lot of snow, so getting more firewood means less suffering from the cold. When his opinion was raised, the family immediately split into two factions. One faction said his opinion was correct because my eldest son is already married and has a child, so it is reasonable to establish a separate household. The other faction believed that whether to split the family is one thing, but the issue is that the reason for proposing to split the family now is driven by "selfishness." In this struggle between the public and the private, the two factions in the family argued fiercely, and we brought this issue to the family study class for discussion.

In the family study class, we first studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and then studied articles from newspapers and magazines criticizing the petty-bourgeois philosophy of Liu Shaoqi. By comparing Mao Zedong Thought with revisionist ideology, the true nature of "selfishness" was revealed. It turned out that my second son, Zhang Wanyuan's idea was to "legitimately and legally gain advantages." The family members exposed his true intentions with seven or eight words. At first, my second son was quite stubborn, insisting that this was legitimate and legal. However, after everyone presented facts and reasoned with him, he finally realized that selfishness disguised as "legality" is even more harmful. No matter who has selfish thoughts, they will come up with many twisted reasons; these twisted reasons cannot stand because their purpose is selfishness.

Through the debate over the firewood issue, our entire family realized that "selfishness" is something that seeks any opportunity and grows with any wind. This "opportunity" is the individualism in one's mind, and this "wind" is the old customs of selfishness and self-interest left over from the old society. Only by taking up the weapon of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" can we not be deceived by surface phenomena when dealing with problems, block the gaps for "selfishness," and uproot the roots of "revisionism."

My husband, Zhang Rong, usually speaks little and his active thoughts are often not easily exposed, and others find it hard to point them out. He is a carpenter responsible for all the carpentry work in the entire brigade, and he does not record points daily but evaluates the total points at the end of the year. After the 1967 settlement, he was depressed for several days, as if he had some grievances. A few children also created public opinion at home, saying that Dad is old, comes home every day saying he is tired, and next year should do less. Aiming at this trend, we studied Chairman Mao's "Qu Feng Moves Mountains" and relevant quotations from the Communist Party members in the family study class, and repeatedly compared them with the deeds of Hero Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong. Afterwards, everyone found their own shortcomings. After several study sessions, my husband was inspired and began to expose his active thoughts. It turned out that he felt that the entire brigade had only one carpenter, and out of a sense of responsibility, he was afraid of not doing well and not completing the task, so he worked hard every day, too tired to eat or sleep well. In addition, it was the end of the year for evaluating points, so it was better to earn more points by piecework than by total points. He had secretly found the cadre and requested to change to piecework recording this year. After studying and fighting selfishness, the whole family helped him analyze and criticize, and he realized that this idea was entirely driven by selfishness, wanting to earn more work points. After fighting selfishness, he actively found the brigade party branch secretary to make a self-criticism, which had a great educational impact on our whole family.

Our family study class is also closely linked to class education. Our whole family has four militia members. My second daughter, Zhang Xiu'e, after being given a gun in 1966, treated this gun as a treasure. However, after some time, she thought the world was peaceful and stopped cleaning and practicing with the gun. Aiming at this problem, in the family study class, the whole family asked her to expose her active thoughts. At first, she was evasive, so we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and conducted a remembrance of bitterness. Through the remembrance of bitterness, linking it to the struggle against the local landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and linking it to the task of preventing and fighting revisionism, we educated our second daughter, making her realize that her past neglect of the gun was a serious mistake. It was a peaceful and complacent idea, a manifestation of forgetting class struggle. She said she would definitely hold the gun in her hand, remember class hatred, defend the socialist homeland, and defend Chairman Mao. From then on, the gun became the most cherished item in our whole family, and the sisters often took turns cleaning the gun and practicing martial arts.

When our family first started the study class, some people in the village said: the brigade and the small team already have study classes, and the family starting one is redundant. However, we feel that the family is the most basic unit of society. In the era of the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, social customs are undergoing tremendous changes. Sometimes, people's "selfishness" in society dare not appear publicly, but it uses the familial relationships of parents and children, husbands and wives, and the "authority" of parents in the family to peddle "selfishness." Therefore, doing a good job in the family's study class of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, using Mao Zedong Thought to reform the family, fighting "selfishness" from society to the family, inside and out, is an important measure to thoroughly eliminate "selfishness."

    红太阳照亮了我们的家
    河北康保县满德堂公社小西沟大队社员　魏淑玉
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，我们立刻召开了全家会议，学习讨论毛主席的最新指示。一九六七年十一月底，我们家就办起了毛泽东思想学习班。
    毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，就象给了我们一副显微镜，有了这个武器，就心明眼亮，不论遇到什么事，先用它照一照，看看是“公”还是“私”。我们家自办起了学习班，全家人都拿起了这个武器，每天谁有了“私”字，就休想逃出大家的眼。比如一九六七年决算分配的时候，我二小子张万元突然提出要和他大哥分家。他的理由是：我们家十几口人，如果按一户算，只能分一份烧柴，如果分了家就可以分两份烧柴；一九六七年我们这里雪大，多分烧柴，就少受冻。他的意见一提出来，全家马上分成了两派。一派说这个意见对，因为我大小子已经结了婚，有了小孩，单立一户，名正言顺。另一派认为，分不分家，这是另一回事，问题是现在提出分家的理由是“私”字当头。在这场公与私的斗争中，一家两派争得很厉害，我们就把这个问题拿到家庭学习班去讨论。
    在家庭学习班，先学习了《纪念白求恩》，又学习了报刊上批判中国赫鲁晓夫市侩哲学的文章。用毛泽东思想同修正主义思想一对照，“私”字就现了原形。原来我二小子张万元那种想法，就是要“合理合法的占便宜”。一家人七言八语地揭老底，一开始，我二小子嘴还很硬，咬定这是合理合法的。但是经过大家摆事实，讲道理，他才认识到：私心披上“合法”的外衣，毒害就更大。不管什么人有了私心杂念，都会想出很多歪道理；这些歪道理所以站不住脚，就是因为它的目的是为私。
    通过辩论分柴这件事，我们全家认识到：“私”字这个东西是见缝就钻，见风就长。这个“缝”就是头脑中的个人主义，这个“风”就是旧社会遗留下来的自私自利的旧风气。只有拿起“斗私，批修”这个武器，才能在处理问题时不被表面现象所迷惑，堵住“私”字的缝，拔掉“修”字的根。
    我男人张荣，平时少言寡语，他的活思想往往不大暴露出来，别人又不好抓。他是个木匠，负责全大队的木匠活，平时不记分，年终评总分。一九六七年决算以后，他沉闷了好几天，好象有情绪，有几个孩子也在家里造舆论，说爹岁数大了，每天回来直喊累，明年应该少做点了。针对这个苗头，我们在家庭学习班上学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》和有关共产党员的语录，又反复对照英雄排长李文忠的事迹，随后各自找差距。经过几次学习，孩子他爹受到了启发，开始暴露了自己的活思想。原来他觉得全大队就自己一个木匠，出于责任心，怕做不好，又怕完不成任务，每天紧着做，累得饭也顾不得吃，觉也睡不实，再加上是年终评分，不如计件挣分多，所以瞒着全家，私下找过干部，要求今年改为按件记分。经过学习，斗私，全家又帮助他分析、批判，他认识到：这个想法完全是私心作怪，是想多挣一些工分。他这一斗私，又主动找大队党支部书记作了检查，对我们全家教育很大。
    我们家庭办学习班，还紧密结合阶级教育。我们全家有四个基干民兵，二女儿张秀娥一九六六年授枪以后，她把这支枪当作珍宝。但是过了一段时间，她认为天下太平，该擦枪不擦了，该练也不练了。针对这个问题，在家庭学习班上，全家人要求她亮亮活思想。开始她躲躲闪闪，我们就反复学习毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大教导，又进行了忆苦。通过忆苦，联系到对村里地、富、反、坏分子斗争的情况，联系到防修反修的任务，教育了二女儿，使她认识到过去对枪不擦不练是非常错误的，这是太平麻痹观念，是忘记阶级斗争的表现。她表示：一定要紧握手中枪，牢记阶级仇，保卫社会主义江山，保卫毛主席。从此以后，枪就成了我们全家最珍爱的物品，小姐妹们经常是抢着擦枪、练武。
    我们家开始举办学习班时，村里有的人说：大队、小队都有学习班，家庭再办，就嫌多余了。但是，我们体会，家庭是组成社会最基本的单位，在毛泽东思想大普及的时代，社会风气正在发生巨大变化，人们头脑里的“私”字，有时在社会上是不敢公开露面了，但是它却利用家庭内的父子、夫妇这种亲属关系，利用父母在家庭内的“权威”，贩卖“私”字。所以搞好家庭斗私批修学习班，用毛泽东思想改造家庭，对“私”字，从社会到家庭，里外一起斗，这是彻底铲除“私”字的一个重要措施。
