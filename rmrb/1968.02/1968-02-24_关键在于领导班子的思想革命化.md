A county's revolutionary committee bears the heavy responsibility of leading tens of thousands to several hundred thousand people in "seizing the revolution and promoting production." How can we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, muster our strength, strive to be the best, and complete the task excellently, creating "first-class work"? Beijing's Pinggu County, which was one of the first to establish a revolutionary committee, has gained valuable experience from the struggle. They believe that the key lies in achieving the ideological revolution of the leadership team.

The issue of power ultimately boils down to the leadership team. The ideological revolution of the leadership team is a top priority for the proletariat to hold and use power well. Only when the leadership team achieves ideological revolution can it lead all levels of cadres and the masses throughout the county to achieve ideological revolution, seize the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution in rural areas, and achieve a double harvest of revolution and production.

The fundamental way to achieve the ideological revolution of the leadership team is to arm the mind with the great thought of Mao Zedong, to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletarian cultural revolution within the leadership team, and make it the guiding principle for all actions. In this way, the county revolutionary committee can become a vibrant, spirited, and clear-sighted revolutionary and combat-ready leadership core.

Achieving the ideological revolution of the leadership team is not something that can be done by staying in the office; rather, it requires "being both an official and a common person." One must go to the forefront of the people's struggle, eat, live, study, work, and fight with the people. One must continually draw wisdom from the people, accept the people's help and supervision, and be closely connected with the people, heart to heart, becoming the true representative of the broad masses. In this way, the revolutionary committee will have a reliable mass foundation, like building on a solid rock. Otherwise, it will be like bean sprouts in a dish, unable to bloom or bear fruit.

To achieve the ideological revolution of the leadership team, one must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The Party committee must rely on this 'group of people' to complete its leadership tasks and give full play to their roles." The newly formed revolutionary committee must pay great attention to mobilizing all positive factors within this "three-in-one" team. As the revolutionary leading cadres, as the backbone of the People's Liberation Army representatives, one must respect and rely on the representatives from the revolutionary masses, so that the leadership team can maintain close contact with the masses through them; at the same time, one must enthusiastically help them achieve ideological revolution, so that they can quickly grow into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. When the leadership team's ideology is unified and their steps are in sync, the role of collective leadership can truly be fully played. Otherwise, as Chairman Mao teaches, "If this 'group of people' does not act in unison, it is impossible to lead thousands or even millions of people to fight or build."

The experience of Pinggu County's revolutionary committee is of great significance for holding revolutionary power. Their experience comes from practice, is full of vitality, and is well worth paying attention to.

    关键在于领导班子的思想革命化
    本报评论员
    一个县的革命委员会，担负着领导少则几万人、多至几十万人“抓革命，促生产”的重大任务。怎样遵照毛主席的教导，鼓足干劲，力争上游，出色地完成任务，创造“第一等的工作”呢？北京市最早成立革命委员会的平谷县，从斗争的实践中取得了可贵的经验。他们认为，关键在于实现领导班子的思想革命化。
    政权问题归根到底是个领导班子的问题。领导班子的思想革命化，是关系到无产阶级掌好权、用好权的头等大事。只有领导班子思想革命化，才能带动全县各级干部和广大群众实现思想革命化，去夺取农村无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，赢得革命和生产的双丰收。
    实现领导班子思想革命化，最根本的途径，就是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装头脑，就是要把毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，在领导班子中落实，使之成为指挥一切的行动纲领。这样，县革命委员会就能成为朝气蓬勃、精神抖擞、心明眼亮的革命化、战斗化领导核心。
    实现领导班子思想革命化，绝不是关在办公室里能够做到的，而是必须“既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”要到群众斗争的大风大浪中去，与群众同吃，同住，同学习，同劳动，同战斗。要不断从群众那里吸取智慧，接受群众的帮助和监督，和群众息息相关，心心相连，成为广大群众的真正代表，得到他们真心实意的拥护。这样，革命委员会就有了可靠的群众基础，如同建立在坚固的磐石上。否则，“就同碟子里的豆芽一样，开不了花，结不了果。”
    实现领导班子思想革命化，要时时刻刻牢记毛主席的教导：“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’，充分发挥他们的作用。”新生的革命委员会，要十分注意调动自己这个“三结合”班子的一切积极因素。作为领导骨干的革命领导干部，作为坚强支柱的人民解放军代表，更要尊重和依靠来自革命群众的代表，使领导班子通过他们经常保持同群众的密切联系；同时要热情帮助他们实现思想革命化，使他们迅速成长为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。领导班子思想一致了，步伐整齐了，集体领导的作用就能真正充分地发挥出来。不然的话，就会象毛主席教导的那样：“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”
    平谷县革命委员会的这些经验，对于掌好革命政权，有很重要的意义。他们的经验，来自实践，富有生命力，很值得重视。
