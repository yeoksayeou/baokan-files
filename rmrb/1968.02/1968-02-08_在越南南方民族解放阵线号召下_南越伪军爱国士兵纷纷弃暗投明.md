According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 6th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported that under the call of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, patriotic soldiers in the South Vietnamese puppet army are turning to the light in droves and have established many patriotic organizations.

According to the report, these newly established organizations include: the Patriotic Soldiers' Association of Quang Nam-Da Nang; the United Association of Patriotic and Peace-Loving Buddhist Soldiers in the Central Region; and the Association of Soldiers of the First Division who have cut ties with the South Vietnamese puppet army.

These organizations enthusiastically acclaim the great victory of the South Vietnamese military and people in the New Year, and call on patriotic soldiers in the puppet army to turn to the light and stand on the side of the country and the people.

It is also reported that after more than a hundred officers and soldiers of the First Division of the South Vietnamese puppet army surrendered to the people, entire units of the puppet army have turned their guns around and rebelled against the enemy. On February 3, a platoon of puppet soldiers in a certain place in Thua Thien Province fought side by side with revolutionary forces against the invading American army. On the 4th, another unit of puppet soldiers stationed north of Hue City at the De Trung outpost also surrendered to the people.
