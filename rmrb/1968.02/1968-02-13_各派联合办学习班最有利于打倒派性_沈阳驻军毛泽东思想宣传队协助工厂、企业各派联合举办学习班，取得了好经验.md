The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be resolved in study classes. The People's Liberation Army's Shenyang Garrison Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, following Chairman Mao's instructions, has since October last year actively assisted factories and enterprises in holding joint Mao Zedong Thought study classes by various revolutionary mass organizations. This has effectively promoted revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Currently, the number of units in the Shenyang factory and enterprise systems that have achieved revolutionary great unity through joint study classes is increasing. Units that have already achieved revolutionary great unity also regard joint study classes as a powerful measure to further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination. As the revolutionary situation develops, these joint study classes are becoming better and better, achieving new successes. The broad masses of workers highly praise these joint study classes held by various factions. They say that holding joint Mao Zedong Thought study classes is most beneficial in overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhancing proletarian party spirit, and is an important path to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The main experiences gained by the Shenyang Garrison Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in assisting factories to hold joint study classes by various factions are as follows:

1. **Fully Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions as the Fundamental Principle for Joint Study Classes, Continuously Solving New Problems and Resolving New Contradictions as the Revolutionary Situation Develops, and Guiding Revolutionary Masses to Move from Victory to Victory.**

   After the revolutionary mass organizations have achieved revolutionary great unity, should the Mao Zedong Thought study classes be continued as before, or should they follow the new situation, solve new problems, and achieve new levels? The Shenyang Garrison Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team's approach is to firmly follow the new situation and boldly guide the masses to advance.

   The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team regards assisting various factions in holding joint study classes as an essential path to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They fully mobilize the masses' enthusiasm, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and based on the development of the revolutionary situation, continuously raise new problems and solve new contradictions. This way, the joint study classes are becoming better and better, revolutionary great unity is more consolidated, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions are more fully implemented. For example, in some factories, after various factions held joint Mao Zedong Thought study classes, overcame factionalism, and achieved two different forms of unity: one from above, where faction leaders reached agreements through negotiations and achieved organizational unity; and one from below, where the broad masses spontaneously achieved revolutionary great unity by workshop and by workshop. The garrison Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team enthusiastically supported the advanced thoughts and pioneering spirit of the masses. They listed the issue of achieving great unity by workshop and by workshop as the central content of the study classes to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, patiently helping those factories where only organizational unity was achieved at the top level. They continued to study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting them to work with revolutionary masses to further eradicate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity by workshop and by workshop.

2. **Focusing on Class Education, Helping Revolutionary Workers to Fundamentally Enhance Proletarian Party Spirit, and Thoroughly Overcoming Bourgeois and Petty-Bourgeois Factionalism.**

   The reactionary bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is currently the major enemy obstructing the revolutionary tide from advancing. In light of this situation, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, when assisting various factions in holding joint Mao Zedong Thought study classes, pay special attention to guiding faction leaders and revolutionary masses to relentlessly pursue and combat, launching a campaign to eradicate factionalism. To truly expose and overthrow factionalism from the ideological level, the propaganda teams follow Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, carrying forward the fine tradition of our Party and Army in political education with class education as the foundation. They focus on class education in the study classes.

   The propaganda teams, when assisting various factions in holding joint study classes, universally carried out reminiscence and comparison activities, guiding everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the proletariat, discussing the noble qualities of the proletariat, the historical mission of the proletariat, and the current responsibilities of the proletariat. The more they study, the deeper they understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the more they hate the factionalism that clings to them, and the more they consciously enhance their proletarian party spirit. They truly imprint Chairman Mao's teachings on "within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions" in their minds and implement them in action. They rise up to denounce the crimes of factionalism, thoroughly uproot the poisonous roots of factionalism, and launch a fierce counterattack against factionalism.

   "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The more intense the class education, the deeper the reminiscence and comparison activities, the more factionalism is exposed, and the more revolutionary great unity develops and consolidates.

3. **After Achieving Revolutionary Great Unity, the Joint Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes Should Focus on Liberating Cadres to Create Conditions for Achieving the Revolutionary Three-in-One Combination, as the Most Important Task for Implementing Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions.**

   In some units where joint Mao Zedong Thought study classes by various factions were held earlier and better, revolutionary great unity has further developed. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams stationed in these units actively support various revolutionary mass organizations in inviting leading cadres to study together. In the study classes, they work with revolutionary masses to help more revolutionary cadres correctly handle relations with the masses, correctly handle their own affairs, and bravely stand up for the revolution.

   In these units, various factions were previously severely opposed, with the focus mainly on the issue of handling leading cadres. One manifestation of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is agreeing with my views means good cadres; disagreeing with my views means bad cadres. In this situation, leading cadres who made mistakes have difficulty getting an opportunity to examine and correct their mistakes. Holding joint study classes provides very favorable conditions for these leading cadres.

   The propaganda teams and the participating revolutionary masses from various factions realize that in the joint study classes held by various factions, factionalism is eliminated, which helps various factions to unify their understanding of leading cadres, eliminate opposing emotions between revolutionary mass organizations; helps leading cadres to examine and correct their mistakes, promote ideological revolutionization; helps cadres to correctly handle relations with the masses, and helps the masses to correctly handle relations with cadres, improving the relationship between cadres and the masses. In summary, it helps to liberate revolutionary leading cadres, creating conditions for consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and quickly achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

4. **Carrying Out Mutual Learning and Mutual Assistance Activities, Promoting the Experiences of Advanced Units, and Expanding from Red Spots to Red Areas.**

   To make the joint Mao Zedong Thought study classes play a powerful role in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the propaganda teams attach great importance to summarizing and promoting the experiences of advanced units, making these experiences bloom and bear fruit in more units. With the help of the propaganda teams, many units regard assisting sister factories in their system and nearby friendly factories to hold joint study classes, promoting and consolidating the revolutionary great unity of these factories, as their glorious responsibility.

   They carry out mutual learning activities in various ways, such as "inviting in and sending out," "one learns, one assists"; or setting up reception stations jointly by various factions holding study classes, turning the reception stations into propaganda stations for Chairman Mao's latest instructions and promoting the experiences of joint study classes; or sending personnel to friendly factories with the PLA to propagate the experiences of holding joint study classes and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

    各派联合办学习班最有利于打倒派性
    沈阳驻军毛泽东思想宣传队协助工厂、企业各派联合举办学习班，取得了好经验
    据新华社沈阳电　伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。人民解放军沈阳驻军毛泽东思想宣传队，遵循毛主席的教导，从去年十月初起，积极协助工厂、企业各派革命群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    目前，沈阳工厂、企业系统中，经过联合举办学习班而实现革命大联合的单位越来越多；已经实现了革命大联合的单位，也把合办学习班作为进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合的有力措施。随着革命形势的发展，这种合办的学习班越办越好，不断取得新的成就。广大工人群众高度赞扬这种各派合办的学习班。他们说，联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，最有利于打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，是全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要途径。
    沈阳驻军毛泽东思想宣传队协助工厂各派联合举办学习班取得的主要经验是：
    一、把全面落实毛主席的最新指示作为合办学习班的根本，随着革命形势的发展，要及时提出新问题，解决新矛盾，不断引导革命群众从胜利走向胜利。
    在革命群众组织实现了革命大联合以后，毛泽东思想学习班是照老样子办下去，还是紧跟新的形势，解决新的矛盾，办出新的水平？沈阳驻军毛泽东思想宣传队采取的做法是坚决紧跟新形势，大胆地引导群众阔步前进。
    毛泽东思想宣传队把协助几派合办学习班，作为全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的必由之路。他们充分发挥群众的积极性，尊重群众的首创精神，根据革命形势的发展，不断地提出新问题，解决新矛盾。这样就使合办的学习班越办越好，革命的大联合越来越巩固，毛主席的最新指示更加落实。例如有的工厂，几派经过合办毛泽东思想学习班，克服派性，出现了两种不同的联合形式：一种来自上面，几派头头通过协商，达成了协议，实现了革命组织的联合；一种来自下面，广大群众自觉地按班组、按车间实现了革命大联合。驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队满腔热情地支持了来自群众的先进思想和首创精神。他们把按班组、按车间实现大联合的问题，列为学习班落实毛主席最新指示的中心内容，耐心地帮助那些只在上面实现革命组织联合的工厂的各派头头，继续活学活用毛主席的最新指示，推动他们同革命群众一起，进一步围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，使这些工厂迅速实现了按班组、按车间的革命大联合。
    二、狠抓阶级教育，帮助革命职工从根本上增强无产阶级党性，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。
    反动的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是当前阻碍革命洪流向前发展的大敌。针对这一情况，各毛泽东思想宣传队在协助几派合办毛泽东思想学习班时，都十分注意引导各派头头和革命群众，穷追猛打，开展围歼派性的斗争。为了真正从思想上彻底搞臭派性，打倒派性，宣传队遵循毛主席的一贯教导，发扬我党我军的在一切政治教育中以阶级教育为基础的优良传统，在学习班中狠抓了阶级教育。
    宣传队协助几派合办的学习班，普遍开展了忆苦思甜活动，引导大家学习毛主席关于工人阶级的论述，谈工人阶级应有的高贵品质，论工人阶级的历史使命，看工人阶级当前应尽的责任。大家越学对毛主席的最新指示理解得越深，越学对缠在自己身上的派性大毒蛇越恨，越学就越自觉地增强无产阶级党性。他们真正把毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，印在脑子里，落实到行动上，纷纷起来控诉派性的罪行，狠挖派性的毒根，大杀派性的回马枪。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”阶级教育抓得狠，忆苦思甜搞得深，派性就搞得越臭，革命的大联合也随着更加发展、巩固。
    三、在实现革命大联合以后，合办的毛泽东思想学习班要把解放干部，为实现革命三结合创造条件，作为落实毛主席最新指示的最重要课题。
    在几派联合举办毛泽东思想学习班办得比较早、比较好的一些单位，革命的大联合已经有了进一步发展。驻这些单位的毛泽东思想宣传队又积极支持各派革命群众组织吸收领导干部一块学习。在学习班里和革命群众一起，努力帮助更多的革命干部正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，勇敢地站出来革命。
    这些单位的几派过去严重对立，焦点大都集中在对待领导干部的问题上。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的表现之一就是同意我的观点，都是好干部；不同意我的观点，就要打倒。在这种情况下，犯了错误的领导干部，很难得到一个检查错误、改正错误的机会。合办学习班，就为这些领导干部提供了极为有利的条件。
    宣传队和参加学习的几派革命群众体会到，在几派合办的学习班里斗掉了派性，有利于几派群众统一对领导干部的认识，消除各革命群众组织之间的对立情绪；有利于领导干部检查和改正自己的错误，促进思想革命化；有利于干部正确对待群众，群众正确对待干部，搞好干部和群众的关系。总之，有利于解放革命领导干部，为巩固和发展革命的大联合、迅速实现革命的三结合创造条件。
    四、开展互学互帮活动，大力推广先进单位的经验，由红一点扩展到红一片。
    为了让合办毛泽东思想学习班在全面落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，发挥强大的作用，宣传队十分重视总结和推广先进单位的经验，使这些经验在更多的单位开花结果。不少单位在宣传队的帮助下，都把帮助本系统的兄弟厂和附近的友邻厂办好合办的学习班，促进和巩固这些工厂的革命大联合，当做自己的光荣责任。
    他们开展帮学活动的方法多种多样，有“请进来，派出去”，“一学一、一帮一”；也有合办学习班的几派联合设立接待站，把接待站办成宣传毛主席最新指示，推广合办学习班经验的宣传站；也有派出人员协同解放军一起到友厂宣传合办学习班、落实毛主席最新指示的体会。
