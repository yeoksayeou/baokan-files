Chairman Mao has long taught us, "In urban struggles, who do we rely on? ... We must wholeheartedly rely on the working class." Chairman Mao also taught us, "The fundamental revolutionary force is the workers and peasants, and the leading class of the revolution is the working class." However, China's Khrushchev shamelessly claims, "The working class at certain times may also be unreliable ... Do not assume that relying on the working class is problem-free." "In the cities, production is key; capitalists know more than we do, more than the workers do ... We must cooperate with them." Enough! With a few words, China's Khrushchev has clearly revealed his traitorous face.

China's Khrushchev's intention is to rely on capitalists to build "socialism."

What "knowledge" do capitalists have? The old workers of San Tiao Shi know best. Apart from their knowledge of exploiting others for personal gain, oppressing workers, and exploiting workers, capitalists have no other knowledge. Relying on this "knowledge," can they manage urban production well? Can they build socialism? No! Absolutely not!

In the old society, the old workers of San Tiao Shi were the most deeply oppressed and exploited by capitalists. The evil capitalists owe us so much; we know best. The blood of our workers is still fresh on the hands of the capitalists, and China's Khrushchev is telling us to "rely on capitalists" and to "cooperate with them." Has the nature of capitalists changed? Let the facts speak!

Take our flour milling machinery factory as an example. After liberation, for a period, the capitalists controlled the actual power in various departments. They did not care about the needs of the countryside; they produced shoddy goods as long as they could make money. They even secretly sold surplus machinery at high prices to speculators.

Our factory had a capitalist who was sentenced to prison. After serving his sentence, he came to our factory and was favored by the capitalist roaders, being appointed as the warehouse keeper in the large hardware store. This guy was even worse; he pretended to be active, eating and sleeping in the warehouse every day, not going home even on rest days or holidays, and was praised by the capitalist roaders as a "red manager." What kind of "red manager" was he? When he needed clothes and quilts, he took the felt bags from the small flour milling machines in our factory that were shipped out. When he needed mosquito nets, he took the silk and cotton cloth. Not only did he use them himself, but he also sold them for profit. Many peasants bought such defective machines and could not grind flour at all. When they wrote to inquire, he blamed the workers.

In 1961, a capitalist handled the construction of five office rooms for the factory. As soon as the rooms were built, a wind blew, and all five new rooms collapsed. Fortunately, we did not move in, or we would all have been crushed to death. Can we rely on them to build socialism as China's Khrushchev suggests? Capitalists and we workers have always been at odds: he thinks of "private" interests, we think of "public" interests; he longs for capitalism, we long for communism, opposing each other like fire and water. It was like this in the past, it is like this now, and as long as they exist, it will remain so. This is the life-and-death class struggle!

The great task of building socialism must be shouldered by the working class. We, the workers of San Tiao Shi, have taken on this responsibility! Chairman Mao rescued us from the depths of despair, and we will forever follow Chairman Mao.

    建设社会主义到底依靠谁？
    三条石面粉机械厂老工人批判组
    毛主席早就教导我们说：“在城市斗争中，我们依靠谁呢？……我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。毛主席还教导我们说：“根本的革命力量是工农，革命的领导阶级是工人阶级。”但是中国的赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么：“工人阶级在一定的时候，也可能是不能依靠的……不要以为依靠工人阶级是没有问题的。”“城市讲生产，资本家的知识比我们多，比工人知道的多……我们必须和他们合作。”够了！中国赫鲁晓夫几句话把他的工贼面孔刻划得清清楚楚。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的意思，就是“社会主义”建设要依靠资本家。
    资本家到底什么“知识”多，我们三条石老工人最了解底细。资本家除了损人利己、唯利是图、压迫工人、剥削工人的“知识”外，什么知识也没有。依靠这些“知识”，能把城市生产搞好，能把社会主义建设好吗？不能！一万个不能！
    在旧社会，我们三条石老工人，受资本家压迫剥削最深，万恶的资本家欠下我们多少债，我们心里最清楚。资本家手上沾的我们工人的鲜血还未干，中国赫鲁晓夫又叫我们“依靠资本家”，叫“我们必须和他们合作”。难道是资本家的本性变了吗？让铁的事实来回答吧！
    就拿我们面粉机械厂来说，解放后有一个时期，各个部门的实权都控制在资本家手里，他们不管农村的需要，粗制滥造，只要赚钱就行。他们还私自把超产机器高价卖给投机倒把的坏人。
    我厂还有个被判刑的资本家，刑满后到我厂，被走资派看中，得到重用，安插在大五金库做保管员。这个家伙更坏，假装积极，成天在仓库吃，仓库睡，下班、休假也不回家，被走资派封为“红管家”。他到底是啥样的“红管家”？他要做衣被，就把我厂等打箱外发的小型面粉机吸风机上的绒布袋子拿走；他要做蚊帐，就把丝绢罗底拿走；不仅他自己用，还卖了赚钱。不少农民买了这样残缺的机器根本没法磨面，来信追究时，他还往工人身上栽赃。
    一九六一年，一个资本家经手给厂里盖五间办公用房，房子刚盖好，一场风，五间新房一间没剩，全塌了。幸亏我们没住进去，要不，都得砸死。中国赫鲁晓夫叫我们依靠他们“建设社会主义”行吗？资本家和我们工人从来就是两条心：他想“私”，我们想“公”；他盼资本主义，我们盼共产主义，针锋相对，水火不容。从前是这样，现在是这样，将来只要他们存在一天，就仍是这样。这就是你死我活的阶级斗争啊！
    伟大的社会主义建设任务，必须担在我们工人阶级肩上。这副担子我们挑定啦！毛主席他老人家把我们三条石工人从火坑里救了出来，我们就永远跟毛主席走。
