Victory Belongs to the Heroic People of Vietnam!
— Warm Congratulations on the New Year's Great Victory of the Vietnamese South Military and Civilians

The heroic armed forces of the Vietnamese South people have shown a high degree of revolutionary heroism, strengthened political work, and paid attention to raising the class consciousness of all officers and soldiers. They have always maintained high morale and vigorous fighting spirit, fully mobilizing the initiative of the people. Before a battle, all officers and soldiers of a heroic unit shouted with raised arms: We will definitely carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end!

The New Year's offensive launched by the heroic military and civilians of the Vietnamese South has achieved a brilliant victory that shocked the world. This powerful New Year's offensive has combined military and civilian efforts, urban and rural areas, and internal and external forces, opening up a new situation in the anti-American, national salvation war and pushing the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese South people to a new high. This great victory has demonstrated the invincible power of the Vietnamese South military and civilians and the immense power of the people's war, announcing the shameful failure of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against Vietnam. The picture shows cadres of the Vietnamese South liberation armed forces studying Chairman Mao's works.

The Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war is a people's war that mobilizes, organizes, relies on, and arms the people. The victorious Vietnamese people have made up their minds to carry the anti-American, national salvation war to the end. These are the cadres of a heroic village, collectively studying the battle plan to strike the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Persistence is victory. I am deeply convinced that the Vietnamese people, by persisting in a protracted war, will definitely drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam." This is a soldier from a unit of the Vietnamese South liberation army in Quang Tri Province, who has won many victories. He is firmly defending his combat position, ready to strike the U.S. aggressors at any time.

The great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, called on the Vietnamese military and civilians to "persist in the fight, strike hard, and strike continuously to win greater victories." The Vietnamese South liberation army has responded resolutely to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call with actual actions, fighting bravely, fearing no sacrifice, and striking hard at the U.S. puppet army, annihilating a large number of the enemy's fighting forces.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." "The army must become one with the people. Only then can it be invincible." Today, in the Vietnamese South, the political power and armed forces of the people are rapidly growing and strengthening. The vast countryside and cities have become a vast sea of the people's war. This is a female soldier from the Vietnamese South transporting ammunition to the front. She has made immortal contributions in the battle against the U.S. aggressors.

The heroic military and civilians of the Vietnamese South are fighting bravely, advancing courageously, pursuing the enemy, and determined to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam without leaving a single one behind.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." Under the thunderous hammer of the people's war, the U.S. imperialist aggressors are beaten black and blue, in a miserable state. Look at the true form of the U.S. aggressors' paper tiger!

    胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！
    ——热烈祝贺越南南方军民新春大捷
    英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量，发扬了高度的革命英雄主义精神，加强政治工作，注意提高全体指战员的阶级觉悟，经常保持部队的高昂士气和旺盛的斗志，充分发挥了人的积极因素。某英雄部队的全体指战员在一次战前动员大会上振臂高呼：誓把抗美救国战争进行到底！
    英雄的越南南方军民发动的新春攻势，取得了震惊世界的辉煌战果。这次强大的新春攻势，越南南方军民实行了军民结合，城乡结合，内外结合，打开了抗美救国战争的新局面，把越南南方人民的革命斗争推向一个新高潮。这一伟大胜利，显示了越南南方军民无敌的力量，显示了人民战争的无比威力，宣告了美帝国主义侵越政策的可耻破产。图为越南南方解放武装力量的干部在学习毛主席著作。
    越南人民抗美救国战争是一场动员人民，组织人民，依靠人民，武装人民的人民战争。胜利前进的越南人民已经下定了把抗美救国战争进行到底的坚强决心。这是一个英雄村庄的干部们，在集体研究打击美国侵略军及其走狗的战斗计划。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“坚持下去就是胜利。我深信，越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。”这是屡战屡胜的广治省越南南方解放军某部战士，坚守战斗岗位，随时准备打击美国强盗。

    越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席号召越南军民“坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利”。越南南方解放军以实际行动坚决响应胡志明主席的伟大号召，英勇战斗，不怕牺牲，狠狠地打击美伪军，大量地歼灭敌人的有生力量。

    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。今日的越南南方，人民的政治力量和武装力量飞速成长壮大，广大乡村和城市已经成为人民战争的汪洋大海。这是越南南方女战士向前方运送弹药。她们在打击美国强盗的战斗中立下了不朽的功勋。

    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”在人民战争雷霆万钧的铁锤打击下，美帝国主义侵略军被打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。请看美国侵略者的纸老虎原形！
