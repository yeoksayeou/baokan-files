In the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary wave in the rural areas of Jilin Province is surging forward, and the preparations for spring farming are in full swing. Both revolution and production are presenting a very good situation.

The main characteristics of the excellent situation in rural Jilin are: Mao Zedong Thought is more widely spread and deeply rooted in people's hearts; the revolutionary criticism movement is vast and deeply developing; Chairman Mao's latest instructions are being fully implemented, and revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are developing rapidly; the preparations for spring farming are both vigorous and solid.

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has flourished in the rural areas of Jilin Province. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres actively responded. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the province has held over 75,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the Yanbian and Tonghua regions, residents in remote mountainous areas have even set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes for three or two households, meeting the needs of more people to participate in the study. The experience of holding family study classes on Chairman Mao's works in Dongfeng County has been widely promoted throughout the rural areas of the province. The entire countryside is a large school for studying Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The main force that has long been struggling and fighting in the countryside is the poor peasants." "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution." In the countryside, the cultural revolutionary army, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, understands Chairman Mao's latest instructions the deepest and executes them the most resolutely. They take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, thoroughly criticize selfishness, eliminate factionalism, overcome anarchist tendencies, and strongly promote revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. At present, more than 80% of the communes in the province have achieved revolutionary unity. A large number of county, commune, and brigade-level cadres have come forward and, together with the revolutionary masses, shoulder the double burdens of revolution and production.

The mass movement of revolutionary criticism in rural Jilin has been continuing for a year. From cities to remote villages, from production teams to individual households, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Whether it is young and strong team members, or white-haired old people, or children who have just begun to understand things, everyone is criticizing and denouncing China's Khrushchev. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants also closely combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. In the criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, through reminiscences and comparisons, love Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and socialism even more; they hate China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line he promotes even more.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jilin Province have turned the revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into productive efforts. They are determined to achieve an even greater agricultural harvest this year on the basis of last year's comprehensive bumper harvest. They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," prepare their weapons and horses, and actively engage in spring farming preparations. After the Spring Festival, many regions have actively carried out spring farming preparations. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the province are full of confidence and will further improve their preparations for spring farming in terms of ideology, organization, and material conditions, fighting the first battle to achieve an agricultural bumper harvest this year.

    吉林农村革命和生产形势大好
    毛泽东思想空前普及，更加深入人心；革命大批判运动波澜壮阔，持续深入开展；毛主席的最新指示正在全面落实，革命大联合和革命三结合迅猛发展；备耕工作搞得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
    据新华社长春二十七日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下，吉林省广大农村革命浪潮滚滚向前，备耕生产热气腾腾，革命和生产都呈现着一派大好形势。
    吉林省农村形势大好的主要特点是：毛泽东思想空前普及，更加深入人心；革命大批判运动波澜壮阔，持续深入开展；毛主席的最新指示正在全面落实，革命大联合和革命三结合迅猛发展；备耕工作搞得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。在无产阶级文化大革命中，吉林省农村活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动蓬勃发展。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部积极响应。在人民解放军的帮助下，全省农村已举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班七万五千多期。延边、通化地区居住在偏僻山区的社员，还办了三家两户的毛泽东思想学习班，满足了更多群众参加学习的要求。东丰县社员家庭举办学习毛主席著作“小课堂”的经验，已在全省农村普遍推广。整个农村到处是学习毛泽东思想的大学校。
    毛主席教导我们：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。”“没有贫农，便没有革命。”农村中，以贫下中农为主体的文化革命大军，对毛主席的最新指示领会最深，执行最坚决。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破私字，围剿派性，克服无政府主义思潮，有力地促进了革命大联合和革命三结合。目前，全省百分之八十以上的公社都已实现了革命大联合。大批县、社、大队三级干部站了出来，同革命群众一道挑起革命和生产两副重担。
    吉林省农村革命大批判的群众运动，已持续开展了一年。从城镇到边远乡村，从社队到社员家庭，到处是革命大批判的战场。无论是青壮年社员，还是白发苍苍的老人，或是刚刚懂事的儿童，人人口诛笔伐，万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫，广大贫下中农还把革命大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。在大批判中，广大贫下中农通过回忆对比，更加热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱毛主席的革命路线，热爱社会主义；更加仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫和他推行的反革命修正主义路线。
    吉林省广大贫下中农把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产上去。他们决心在去年农业全面大丰收的基础上，夺取今年农业更大的丰收。他们坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，厉兵秣马，积极投入备耕活动。春节一过，许多地区积极开展了备耕活动。全省广大贫下中农满怀信心，要在思想上、组织上和物质条件上进一步做好春耕准备工作，打好夺取今年农业丰收的第一仗。
