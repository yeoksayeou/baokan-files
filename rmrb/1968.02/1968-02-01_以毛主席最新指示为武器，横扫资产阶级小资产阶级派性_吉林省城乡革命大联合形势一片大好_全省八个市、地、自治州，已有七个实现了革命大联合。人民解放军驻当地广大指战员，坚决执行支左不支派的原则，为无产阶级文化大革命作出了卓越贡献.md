In the midst of the triumphant songs of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Jilin Province are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, sweeping away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthening proletarian party spirit. The tide of revolutionary great unity is surging forward. At present, out of the eight cities, prefectures, and autonomous prefectures in the province, seven have achieved revolutionary great unity. A number of counties, cities, factories, enterprises, and schools have also established revolutionary committees.

Entering the radiant year of 1968, Jilin Province, from the eastern Changbai Mountains to the western Baicheng grasslands, from cities to rural areas, has launched a new high tide of studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people have carried forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, studying and applying Marxism-Leninism. After Chairman Mao issued the instruction that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," the two major factions of revolutionary masses in Shulan County were the first in the province to achieve revolutionary great unity. Subsequently, more than ten cities and counties, including Changchun, Dehui, Dongfeng, Liaoyuan, and Tonghua, achieved revolutionary great unity one after another. Other cities, counties, and grassroots organizations are also striving to achieve revolutionary great unity with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day."

Establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the most important measure to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and quickly achieve revolutionary great unity. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, nearly 5,000 various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held at all levels across the province, with tens of thousands of workers, peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres participating in the study. Through the study, they further resolved issues such as correctly understanding the good situation, correctly treating oneself, correctly treating brother organizations, and correctly treating cadres. Many problems that were not previously resolved were easily solved, strongly promoting revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people across the province, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, swept away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthened proletarian party spirit. They studied the New Year editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily, as well as the editorial "On the Reactionary Nature of Factionalism" from the Wenhui Daily, greatly raising their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and their awareness of criticizing and repudiating revisionism. They exposed the harm of factionalism, dug out the roots of factionalism, mobilized everyone, and launched a people's war to annihilate factionalism. After criticizing and repudiating revisionism, the two factions that were previously "enemies" have now become close comrades; previously, they fought over "mountaintops" and seats, now they let seats and ranks to each other; previously, they were "highly guarded" and did not communicate, now they are open and frank, and fight together.

On the basis of revolutionary great unity, a high tide of revolutionary three-in-one combination has emerged across the province. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly treating cadres is a key issue in implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This issue must be resolved." Many revolutionary leading cadres studied Chairman Mao's works together with the revolutionary masses, criticized and repudiated revisionism, actively listened to the masses' criticism, and deeply touched their souls. The revolutionary masses also enthusiastically helped the erring cadres return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, daring to liberate, use, and combine cadres. At present, a number of cities, counties, factories, enterprises, and schools in the province have achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination and established revolutionary committees.

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jilin Province, who are fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," have responded to the great commander Chairman Mao's battle call, earnestly implementing the principle of supporting the left but not supporting factions, promoting the development and consolidation of revolutionary great unity in various places. They believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and learn from the masses. In the work of "three supports and two militaries," they brought the good traditions of emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, promoting the three-eighths style, and advocating the three great democracies to the broad masses. With great enthusiasm, they armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, helping the broad masses to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in the revolutionary ranks to the track of proletarian revolution, overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strongly promoting the achievement of revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They have made outstanding contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jilin Province.

   以毛主席最新指示为武器，横扫资产阶级小资产阶级派性
   吉林省城乡革命大联合形势一片大好
   全省八个市、地、自治州，已有七个实现了革命大联合。人民解放军驻当地广大指战员，坚决执行支左不支派的原则，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了卓越贡献
    新华社长春三十日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，吉林省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，横扫资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，革命大联合的洪流，滚滚向前。目前，全省八个市、地、自治州已有七个实现了革命大联合，还有一批县、市和工厂、企业、学校建立了革命委员会。
    进入光辉灿烂的一九六八年以后，吉林省从东部的长白山区，到西部的白城草原，从城市到农村，掀起了一个学习、宣传、落实毛主席一系列最新指示的新高潮。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众发扬毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义革命学风，对毛主席的最新指示，学一条，用一条，学用结合，立竿见影。毛主席发出
  “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示后，舒兰县两大派革命群众组织在全省首先实现了革命的大联合。接着，长春、德惠、东丰、辽源和通化等十多个市、县的两大派革命群众组织，陆续实现了革命的大联合。其它市、县和基层组织，也以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，奋起直追，积极筹备和协商实现革命的大联合。
    大办毛泽东思想学习班，是活学活用毛泽东思想、落实毛主席最新指示，迅速实现革命大联合的最重要措施。在人民解放军的帮助下，全省各地、各级举办了近五千期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有几十万工农群众、红卫兵小将和革命干部参加了学习。他们通过学习，进一步解决了正确认识大好形势，正确对待自己、正确对待兄弟组织、正确对待干部等问题，许多过去未能解决的问题，都迎刃而解，有力地推动了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。在毛泽东思想学习班上，各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，横扫资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。他们通过学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论和《文汇报》社论《论派性的反动性》，大大提高了落实毛主席最新指示的自觉性，提高了斗私批修的自觉性。他们大摆派性的危害，大挖派性的毒根，人人动员，处处出击，打了一场围歼派性的“人民战争”。经过斗私批修，两派群众组织过去是“冤家对头”，现在成了亲密战友；过去是相互抢“山头”、争席位，现在是互相让席位、让名次；过去是“戒备森严”，互不往来，现在是开诚布公，共同对敌。
    在革命大联合的基础上，全省又出现了革命三结合的高潮。毛主席教导我们说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”许多革命的领导干部同革命群众一起学习毛主席著作，斗私批修，主动听取群众的批评，狠触灵魂。革命群众也热情地帮助犯错误的干部回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，大胆解放干部、使用干部、结合干部。目前，全省已有一批市、县和工厂、企业、学校实现了革命的三结合，建立了革命委员会。
    战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军驻吉林省广大指战员，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席的战斗号召，认真执行支左不支派的原则，促进了各地革命大联合的发展和巩固。他们相信群众，依靠群众，向群众学习。在“三支”“两军”工作中，把突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主等一系列好传统，带给广大群众，满腔热情地用毛泽东思想武装群众，帮助广大群众把革命队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，有力地促进了革命大联合和革命三结合的实现，为吉林省无产阶级文化大革命作出了卓越的贡献。
