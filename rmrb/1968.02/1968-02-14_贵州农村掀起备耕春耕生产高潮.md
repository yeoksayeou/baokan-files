In the midst of the advance towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Guizhou Province are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have launched a high tide of preparation for spring plowing and production, determined to achieve an even greater harvest in agricultural production this year. According to incomplete statistics, the province has started construction on more than 37,900 water conservancy projects; winter wheat and rapeseed have all been timely managed in the fields; and since last winter, the province has planted more than 30,000 acres of trees.
