Laotian Patriotic Forces Launch Ferocious Assault, Liberate Entire Mueang Xieng Region

New York Times, Kheang Kai, Feb. 9 - According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, on the morning of February 3, the Laotian Patriotic Forces launched a fierce attack on three right-wing army camps stationed south of the Chaleun Plain in the Mueang Xieng region. They swiftly captured the enemy's military headquarters and liberated the entire region.

The report states that the Laotian Patriotic Forces used concentrated artillery fire to bombard the enemy's positions, inflicting heavy casualties and significant losses. In the attack on the enemy's 23rd Battalion alone, nearly 40 enemy soldiers were killed. The remaining enemy forces fled in disarray like homeless dogs.

The Mueang Xieng region is located south of Xieng Khouang Province. The Laotian Patriotic Forces have repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the enemy in this region, inflicting heavy casualties. According to reports, from August 3, 1967, to the end of January 1968, the Laotian Patriotic Forces annihilated 461 enemy soldiers and shot down 14 enemy aircraft.

Another report states that in January, the patriotic military and civilians of Xam Neua Province successfully repelled multiple enemy incursions, annihilating 53 enemy soldiers, including one captain, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies. The local patriotic military and civilians also liberated 13 villages with a population of over 2,000 people.

New York Times, Kheang Kai, Feb. 8 - According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the Laotian People's Liberation Army High Command issued a victory bulletin on February 6, stating that from January 12 to January 26, the Laotian patriotic military and civilians in the Nam Bao region annihilated 2,937 enemy soldiers, including the complete annihilation of six enemy battalions and the heavy defeat of three battalions. They also destroyed or shot down 13 enemy aircraft.

The bulletin states that among the annihilated enemy forces, 991 were killed or wounded, and 1,946 were captured or surrendered, including one lieutenant colonel, three majors, and 36 company commanders. Additionally, two American "advisors" were wounded. The Laotian Patriotic Forces also seized a large amount of weapons, including 83 cannons, recoilless rifles, and mortars, 120 heavy and light machine guns, and 843 rifles and pistols. In the three days up to January 14, the Laotian Patriotic Forces liberated 143 villages with tens of thousands of residents.

The bulletin states that Nam Bao is a strategic area in Upper Laos. In 1961, the local people rose up and liberated this place. In July 1966, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the right-wing army launched a large-scale attack and infiltration into this region, attempting to turn it into a base for occupying Upper Laos and expanding U.S. aggression in Laos and Indochina. However, the enemy's attacks could not subdue the people of Nam Bao. The people of Nam Bao, together with the patriotic armed forces, used various weapons in their hands to bravely and intelligently fight against the enemy. From July 1966 to December 1967, before the liberation of Nam Bao, the patriotic armed forces and people in this region annihilated 2,265 enemy soldiers and tied down 4,500 enemy soldiers, including four regiments and one battalion.

The bulletin states that this great victory in Nam Bao has shattered the U.S. imperialists' and their lackeys' strategic plans to invade Upper Laos and expand the Indochina war of aggression. The great victory in Nam Bao shows that the Laotian patriotic military and civilians have the ability to quickly annihilate the enemy in a single battle and have made progress in tactics, operations, and command.

The bulletin concludes by stating that the warlike and aggressive U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, despite suffering heavy defeats, remain extremely stubborn and have not abandoned their sinister plots to invade Laos. Therefore, the Laotian Patriotic Armed Forces and people must remain vigilant, seize the initiative on the battlefield, and bravely advance to annihilate large enemy forces; they must be ready at any time to thwart the enemy's new military adventures.

New York Times, Kheang Kai, Feb. 5 - According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, from October 17 of last year to January 25 of this year, the heroic patriotic military and civilians of Phongsali Province launched fierce attacks on the enemy who came to create disturbances in the liberated areas, annihilating 594 enemy soldiers and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies. During this period, the Phongsali Provincial Liberation Army and the patriotic neutral forces, with the strong support of the local people, also liberated Oudomxay District and Ouvone District.

The patriotic military and civilians of Sam Neua Province frequently launched attacks in January, annihilating a large number of enemy forces.

In the first 22 days of January, the patriotic military and civilians of Sam Neua Province bravely fought, annihilating 249 enemy soldiers, including the complete annihilation of one pseudo-military battalion, and seizing a large amount of enemy weapons.

    南博大捷战果辉煌歼敌近三千包括全歼敌军六个营重创三个营
    新华社康开九日电  据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国武装力量三日清晨猛烈袭击驻扎在查尔平原以南芒银地区的三个营的右派军队，迅速攻占敌人军事总部，并解放了整个芒银地区。
    报道说，老挝爱国武装力量在战斗中以密集的炮火轰击敌人的阵地，打得敌人死伤累累，损失惨重。单单在对第二十三营敌人发动的袭击战中，老挝爱国武装力量就歼敌近四十名。挨了揍的残敌如丧家之犬四处逃窜。
    芒银地区位于川圹省以南，老挝爱国武装力量对这一地区的敌人不断发动猛烈进攻，给敌人以重大杀伤。据报道，从一九六七年八月三日到一九六八年一月底，老挝爱国武装力量共歼灭敌军四百六十一名，击落敌机十四架。
    另据报道，甘蒙省老挝爱国军民一月份接连击退敌人多次蚕食进攻，歼灭敌人五十三名，其中有上尉一名，并缴获大批武器和军用物资。当地爱国军民解放了拥有两千多人的十三个村庄。
    新华社康开八日电据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部六日发表南博地区大捷公报指出，老挝爱国军民在到一月二十六日为止的十四天中，在南博地区共歼灭敌军两千九百三十七人，包括全歼敌军六个营和重创三个营；击毁击落敌机十三架。
    公报指出：在被歼的敌军中，有九百九十一人被打死打伤，一千九百四十六人被俘或投降，其中包括一名中校、三名少校和三十六名连长，此外，还有两名美国“顾问”被打伤。老挝爱国武装力量在战斗中，还缴获了大批武器，其中有大炮、无后座力炮和迫击炮八十三门，重机枪和轻机枪一百二十挺，步枪、手枪八百四十三支。在到一月十四日为止的三天里，老挝爱国武装力量解放了有几万居民的一百四十三个村庄。
    公报指出：南博是上寮的一个战略区，一九六一年当地人民曾经起义解放了这个地方。一九六六年七月，在美帝国主义唆使下，右派军队出动大批兵力，大举进攻和蚕食这个地区，企图把这个地区变成占领上寮和扩大美国在老挝和印度支那的侵略战争的一个据点。但是，敌人的进攻征服不了南博人民，南博人民同爱国武装力量一道，用他们手中的各种武器，英勇机智地同敌人进行斗争。从一九六六年七月到一九六七年十二月南博解放之前，这个地区的爱国武装力量和人民就歼灭了两千二百六十五名敌军，并在这个地区牵制住包括四个团和一个营的四千五百名敌军。
    公报说：这次南博大捷粉碎了美帝及其走狗侵略上寮和扩大印度支那侵略战争的战略计划。南博大捷表明老挝爱国军民有能力在一个战役中迅速消灭敌军，在战术、作战和指挥等方面都有了进步。
    公报最后说：好战和侵略成性的美帝国主义及其走狗尽管遭到了惨重的失败，但仍然极其顽固，并没有放弃侵略老挝的险恶阴谋。因此，老挝爱国武装力量和人民必须提高警惕，在战场上牢牢掌握主动权，奋勇前进，歼灭大批敌军兵力；随时准备挫败敌人一切新的军事冒险。
    据新华社康开五日电据巴特寮通讯社报道，英雄的老挝丰沙里省爱国军民从去年十月十七日到今年一月二十五日，猛烈打击前来解放区进行骚乱的敌人，歼敌五百九十四名，缴获大批武器和军用物资。在这期间，丰沙里省人民解放军和爱国中立力量，在当地人民的大力支援下，还解放了乌太县和乌瓦县。
