Chairman Mao teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." How can study classes be made effective immediately? The experience of many grassroots units in Shanghai is: only by focusing on the urgent practical problems that need to be solved in the unit, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and using the arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the current problems, can one period of study yield one period of results.

Recently, the newspaper invited members of the revolutionary committees from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 8, Shanghai Silicon Steel Plant, Shanghai Sock Factory, and Shanghai Dyeing and Chemical Factory No. 8 to discuss their experiences in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

	Self-criticism by all, enhancing unity between old and new cadres
	Shanghai Steel Plant No. 8, Fang Jinjue:
	After our proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, we were busy with administrative tasks every day, and many problems were not well solved. Later, with the help of the PLA comrades, we conducted an analysis and research, believing that we must first grasp the main contradiction and solve it. What was the most urgent problem that our plant needed to solve at that time? It was the problem of unity between new and old cadres.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "If our party does not have a large number of new cadres working together with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." In our plant, some new cadres thought that old cadres were conservative and lacked revolutionary spirit, and were very dissatisfied; they did not trust or rely on cadres who had made mistakes. Old cadres were also not satisfied with new cadres, focusing on minor issues and not seeing the big picture. The lack of unity between new and old cadres affected the unity of the masses and cadres, and hindered the development of various work. We seized this problem and organized new and old cadres to study in batches.

	Since the ideological situations of new and old cadres were different, we determined different study contents. New cadres focused on studying "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," guiding them to use class perspective to distinguish between two different types of people in power, and to use the dialectical method to deal with old cadres. Mao Zedong Thought opened the minds of new cadres. They realized that they had not acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings: they only saw the mistakes of some old cadres during the Cultural Revolution, not their consistent performance over the past decade; they only saw the conservative side of old cadres, not their revolutionary side. Some comrades criticized their own mistake of not trusting old cadres and checked their arrogance and complacency.

	For old cadres, we required them to focus on studying "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and to discuss their understanding of the Cultural Revolution, checking their own poisoning by the bourgeois reactionary line, and correcting their views on revolutionary masses and mass movements. They realized that: in this movement, a large number of revolutionary new cadres emerged, which is a great and joyful event.

	Because new and old cadres actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, they each conducted self-criticism, greatly enhancing their unity and also strengthening the relationship between the masses and cadres.

	Overcoming arrogance and complacency, becoming thorough revolutionaries
	Shanghai Silicon Steel Plant, Gu Baogen:
	Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, our plant achieved great success in the Cultural Revolution. However, among some leaders of the revolutionary committee, arrogance, complacency, and fear of difficulties emerged. Some leaders of revolutionary organizations thought that the "three-in-one combination" had been achieved, and the great revolutionary task was completed, so they could relax; some comrades did not want to do hard and detailed work. Some revolutionary leading cadres often thought that they had too many rules and could not adapt to the needs of the current revolutionary situation, and were willing to be "supporting actors" rather than "leading actors," afraid to take on heavy responsibilities. Due to these ideological problems, the work of the revolutionary committee appeared to be dragging, seriously weakening its combat effectiveness. With the help of the stationed PLA, we seized this problem and held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Revolutionary leading cadres, leaders of revolutionary organizations, and revolutionary masses gathered to study, using the "Three Articles" as the main textbooks, and also studying "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China."

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li." "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." We used Chairman Mao's instructions to analyze the current class struggle situation, making everyone realize that although the Cultural Revolution had achieved great victories, and the revolutionary committee of our plant had been established, this only meant that we should do our work more deeply and meticulously; arrogance and complacency, fear of taking on heavy responsibilities, and fear of taking risks are all considerations from personal interests, not from the interests of the state and the proletariat, and are actually half-hearted revolutionaries, which will cause the revolution to be abandoned halfway.

	Through criticizing and repudiating oneself, everyone enhanced their class struggle awareness and strengthened their sense of political responsibility. The relationship between new and old cadres achieved unprecedented unity. New and old cadres, according to the needs of revolutionary work, competed to take on heavy revolutionary responsibilities.

	Starting from ideological education, overcoming anarchism
	Shanghai Sock Factory, Hao Mingzhen, Zhang Mingjun:
	After the establishment of our plant's revolutionary committee, the most headache-inducing problem was the trend of anarchism. It seriously affected the revolution and production. What to do? At first, we adopted administrative commands. However, the effect was not good.

	Later, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Mastering ideological education is the central link for uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles" and started Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The whole plant, workshops, cadres, and masses studied together.

	Through initial study, we believed that the key to overcoming the trend of anarchism lay in leadership. Therefore, in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, the responsible comrades of the revolutionary committee first exposed their private thoughts and engaged in self-criticism, universally checking: whether they led by example? Whether they had done detailed ideological work among the masses? The comrades of the revolutionary committee also went deep into the teams, to places where the trend of anarchism was more serious, participated in labor, and did detailed ideological work.

	In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, we organized the masses to repeatedly study the "Three Articles," "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and relevant quotations on criticizing anarchism. Chairman Mao said: "Anarchism does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people." "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places." Through study, everyone realized that anarchism is a vicious means by which the bourgeoisie attacks the proletariat, and is a worm that has burrowed into our minds; the struggle against anarchism is a reflection of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads in the new situation.

	In the study class, we also focused on class education. Through recalling bitterness and sweetness, we raised the class consciousness of the masses, inspiring everyone to consciously struggle against the trend of anarchism. Now, the political atmosphere in the whole plant is unprecedentedly high, a new revolutionary order has been established, and production is thriving.

	Enhancing revolutionary consciousness, turning laggards into advanced units
	Shanghai Dyeing and Chemical Factory No. 8, Shen Jinhua, Zhang Zhi Long:
	The situation of the Cultural Revolution in our plant is good, but some units are still in a backward state. How to turn laggards into advanced units, and advanced units into even more advanced units, is a major problem facing the plant's revolutionary committee. At first, we did not know where to start. Later, we found that the originally backward Fifth Workshop, due to holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, produced significant changes, so we seized this typical example for promotion. Many workers in the Fifth Workshop stood on the wrong side in the early stages of the movement and could not catch up for a long time. After the establishment of the plant's revolutionary committee, the comrades in this workshop took the initiative to start the first part-time study class in the whole plant. At the beginning of the study, they first checked their own learning attitudes, feeling that they had not paid enough attention to the study of Chairman Mao's works in the past, mainly because they had been influenced by the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, focusing only on production and not on politics. Then, they conducted a comparison and remembrance, thereby enhancing their understanding of the significance of the struggle between the two lines, and enhancing their enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works. They focused on studying the "Three Articles," exposing their private thoughts and engaging in self-criticism, bringing out all the thoughts that were previously "unworthy of mention." Some workers with low cultural levels wrote Chairman Mao's quotations on the blackboard, reading them during work and reciting them after work, memorizing them sentence by sentence. Through study, the relationships between people and the production situation in the entire workshop changed significantly.

	We seized the typical example of the Fifth Workshop, and after promoting it through multiple experience-sharing meetings, the whole plant saw a new situation where various units took the initiative to hold study classes. The workers and masses educated themselves and liberated themselves, striving to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, greatly promoting the revolutionization of thought.

    办毛泽东思想学习班怎样才能立竿见影？
    上钢八厂、上海矽钢片厂、上海袜厂和上海染化八厂革委会成员座谈带着问题办学习班的体会
    本报讯　毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”办学习班怎样才能立竿见影？上海许多基层单位的经验是：只有抓住本单位迫切需要解决的实际问题，举办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想之矢，射当前问题之的，才能办一期收到一期的效果。
    最近，本报邀请了上海钢铁八厂、上海矽钢片厂、上海袜厂、上海染化八厂等单位的革命委员会成员，座谈了办好毛泽东思想学习班的体会。
    各自多做自我批评，增进新老干部团结
    上海钢铁八厂方锦岳：
    我厂无产阶级革命派夺权以后，一度天天忙于事务，许多问题没有很好解决。后来，我们在解放军同志帮助下，进行了分析研究，认为必须首先抓住主要矛盾，加以解决。当时，我厂最迫切需要解决的问题是什么呢？是新老干部的团结问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”在我们厂里，有些新干部认为老干部思想保守，革命性不强，很不称心；对犯过错误的干部，更是不相信、不放心。老干部对新干部也不服气，计较支流，不看大方向。新老干部的不团结，影响了群众和干部的团结，影响了各项工作的开展。我们抓住这个问题，组织新老干部分期分批地集中学习。
    由于新老干部的思想情况不同，我们确定了不同的学习内容。新干部着重学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，引导他们用阶级观点去分清两种性质不同的当权派，用一分为二的观点去对待老干部。毛泽东思想使新干部的头脑开了窍，他们认识到自己没有按照毛主席的教导办事：只看某些老干部在文化大革命中的错误言行，不看他们十多年来的一贯表现；只看到他们保守的一面，没有看到他们革命的一面。有的同志批判了自己对老干部一概不信任的错误，检查了自己的骄傲自满情绪。
    对老干部，我们要求他们着重学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》，结合谈对文化大革命的体会，检查自己受资产阶级反动路线的毒害，端正对革命群众和群众运动的看法。使他们认识到：在这次运动中涌现出大批革命的新干部，是一件可喜的大事。
    由于新老干部活学活用毛泽东思想，各自作了自我批评，大大增强了他们之间的团结，也密切了群众和干部的关系。克服骄傲松劲情绪，做彻底的革命派
    上海矽钢片厂顾宝根：
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我厂文化大革命取得了很大成就。但是，在革命委员会的某些领导成员中，却滋长了骄傲、松劲和畏难情绪。有的革命组织的负责人认为实现了革命的“三结合”，革命大功告成，可以松一口气了；有的同志不愿意做艰苦、细致的工作。有些革命领导干部，又往往认为自己条条框框多，不能适应当前革命形势的需要，愿意当“配角”，不愿当“主角”，怕挑重担。由于这些思想问题存在，革命委员会的工作中出现了扯皮现象，严重地削弱了自己的战斗力。我们在驻厂解放军的帮助下，抓住这个问题，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。革命领导干部，革命组织的负责人和革命群众集中在一起学习，以“老三篇”为基本教材，并且学习了《将革命进行到底》和《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》。
    毛主席教导我们：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”我们用毛主席的指示，去分析当前阶级斗争形势，使大家认识到文化大革命虽然取得了伟大胜利，我厂革命委员会虽然成立了，但这只意味着我们应该把工作做得更加深入，更加细致；骄傲自满，怕挑重担，怕冒风险，都是从个人利益考虑，不是从国家和无产阶级利益考虑，实际上是半截子革命派，会使革命半途而废。
    通过斗私批修，大家增强了阶级斗争观念，加强了政治责任感，新老干部的关系出现了空前未有的团结。新老干部根据革命工作的需要，争挑革命的重担。
    从思想教育入手，克服无政府主义
    上海袜厂郝名振、张明钧：
    我厂革命委员会成立以后感到最头痛的一个问题，是无政府主义倾向。它严重地影响了抓革命，促生产。怎么办？开始，我们采取了行政命令的办法。但是效果并不好。
    后来，我们学习了毛主席关于“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，办起了毛泽东思想学习班。全厂办，车间办，干部和群众一起学习。
    通过初步学习，我们认为，克服无政府主义倾向的关键在于领导。因此，在毛泽东思想学习班里，我们革命委员会的负责人首先亮私、斗私，普遍检查：是不是以身作则？有没有深入群众做细致的思想工作？革命委员会的同志还深入班组，到无政府主义倾向较严重的地方去，参加劳动，做深入细致的思想工作。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，我们组织群众反复学习“老三篇”、“三大纪律，八项注意”，以及有关批判无政府主义的语录。毛主席说：“无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。”“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”。通过学习，大家认识到，无政府主义是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一种恶毒手段，是钻进我们头脑里的蛀虫；同无政府主义的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在新形势下的反映。
    在学习班里，我们还大抓阶级教育。通过忆苦思甜，提高了群众的阶级觉悟，启发大家自觉地同无政府主义倾向作斗争。现在，全厂政治空气空前高涨，建立了革命的新秩序，生产蒸蒸日上。
    提高革命自觉性，落后变先进
    上海染化八厂沈锦华、张稚龙：
    我厂文化大革命形势很好，但是有些单位还处在后进的状态。怎样使后进变为先进，先进更先进，是摆在厂革命委员会面前的一个主要问题。开始，我们也不知从何下手，后来发现一直比较落后的第五工段，由于办毛泽东思想学习班产生了重大变化，就抓住这典型加以推广。第五工段的不少工人在运动初期站错了队，迟迟不能跟上来。在厂革命委员会成立后，这个工段的同志主动地办起了全厂第一个业余学习班。学习开始，他们首先检查了自己的学习态度，感到过去对毛主席著作的学习重视不够，主要是因为受了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的影响，只顾生产，不问政治。接着，他们又进行了回忆对比，从而提高了对两条路线斗争的意义的认识，提高了学习毛主席著作的热情。他们狠抓“老三篇”的学习，亮私斗私，把过去“见不得人”的活思想都亮了出来。有的工人文化程度低，就把毛主席语录写在黑板上，上班读，下班念，一句一句记在心头。通过学习，全工段人与人的关系和生产面貌，都有了很大的变化。
    我们抓住五工段这个典型，通过多次讲用会推广后，全厂出现了各单位主动办学习班的新形势。职工群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，努力用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，大大促进了思想革命化。
