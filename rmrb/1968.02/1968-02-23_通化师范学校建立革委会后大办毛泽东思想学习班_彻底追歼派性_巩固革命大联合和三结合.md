After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, Tonghua Normal School in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, has been focusing on the eradication of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, further consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination.

To consolidate the three-in-one combination, the eradication of factionalism must continue

After the establishment of the school's revolutionary committee, the revolutionary teachers and students of Tonghua Normal School had differing opinions on what the focus of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes should be. Some advocated that the classes should continue to emphasize strengthening proletarian party spirit and overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Their reasoning was that although the organizational forms of the two factions no longer exist, the specter of factionalism has not been dispelled, and the roots of evil have not been eradicated. If the poison of factionalism is not purged, it will still wreak havoc in suitable conditions, harming the revolutionary cause. To consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination, the eradication of factionalism must continue. However, some people believed that since factionalism had already been eradicated in the past, the two opposing factions had already achieved revolutionary great alliance, and the school's revolutionary committee had been established, there was no need to continue fighting factionalism. Currently, to consolidate the three-in-one combination, the primary task is to stabilize the students' emotions.

What should be the focus? The People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed at the school and the members of the school's revolutionary committee organized the entire school's teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must build a centralized and unified party. All factional struggles without principles must be thoroughly eliminated. We must make the steps of our entire party uniform and consistent, and strive for a common goal. We must oppose individualism and sectarianism." After studying Chairman Mao's teachings and reflecting on the school's actual situation, everyone's minds became clear, and they unanimously recognized that if they ignored the continued struggle against the dangerous enemy of factionalism in their minds, they could not consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination, and they could not complete the more arduous and magnificent battle tasks assigned by Chairman Mao.

Thus, the entire school's Mao Zedong Thought study classes listed the continued eradication of factionalism as the central content, thoroughly excavating and criticizing factionalism. The students of Class 3, Grade 2, uncovered their factionalism during the election of the revolutionary committee and recognized the tenacity of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Some students said: On the day of the revolutionary committee election, they had previously studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and felt very happy, but during the vote count, they felt uncomfortable when they heard the names of the opposing faction's members being called out consecutively, fearing that the opposing faction would gain the upper hand; later, when they heard the names of their own faction's members being called out consecutively, their mood immediately improved. This change in mood indicated that factionalism was still lurking in the depths of their thoughts. The revolutionary teachers and students in the study classes not only criticized factionalism that had already manifested in actions but also thoroughly excavated the factionalism hidden in the depths of their thoughts, exposing the ugly face of factionalism in broad daylight. Some teachers and students checked themselves, saying: In the past, when the factional flags were up, they were always at the forefront of everything; now that the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination have been achieved, the factional flags have fallen, and their enthusiasm is not as strong as before, even becoming "carefree individuals," which is factionalism at work.

After such a discussion, everyone's understanding deepened further. They saw that factionalism was still at work in their minds, and the main direction of the study classes must continue to be the struggle against factionalism.

Recognizing the reactionary nature of factionalism, arousing hatred towards factionalism

However, in the study classes, some people still showed a lack of hatred towards factionalism, saying: "These fleeting factional thoughts are not harmful and can be ignored whether fought or not."

The main reason these comrades could not hate factionalism was their insufficient understanding of its reactionary nature. Therefore, the school revolutionary committee organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the editorial "On the Reactionary Nature of Factionalism" from the *Wenhui Daily*. Each class recalled the origins and development of factionalism, exposing its reactionary nature. The students of Class 1, Grade 2 also wrote a quick-talk poem, vividly depicting factionalism.

Through stripping factionalism of its disguise and listing its crimes, a large number of facts helped the revolutionary teachers and students further recognize the reactionary nature of factionalism. They said: This venomous snake of factionalism, in the new situation of the deepening of the Cultural Revolution, played the role of a special action team for a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. We must never let down our revolutionary vigilance against it. If we do not heighten our vigilance and allow factionalism to spread, then one day, the revolutionary committee might turn into a parliament of bourgeois factional struggles, and our victory fruits would be snatched away by the class enemy. Although small, worms can bore into big trees; although fleeting, factionalism is a hidden danger to the three-in-one combination.

The deeper the hatred for factionalism, the stronger the resolve to fight it. The broad revolutionary teachers and students deeply detested factionalism and were determined to fight it with the same ferocity used to fight the capitalist reactionary line. The members of the revolutionary committee took the lead in exposing and fighting factionalism in the study classes, sharing their experiences in fighting factionalism, which powerfully inspired the masses to fight factionalism.

The entire school's teachers and students fought factionalism with high awareness, never letting go of even a fleeting factional thought. One day, Li Liying, a student from Class 1, Grade 3, noticed that the student leading the recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations was from the opposing faction, and she became unhappy, reading in a smaller voice. But she quickly realized that this was factionalism at work and needed to be addressed immediately. That day, she repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings and fought against this fleeting thought. In the study class, students Liu Yulan and Liu Fenglan also discussed how they used to feel uncomfortable when hearing criticisms of their faction's shortcomings, which was a sign of protecting their own and their faction. The more they protected, the shorter they became, and the more severe the factionalism.

Everyone fiercely fought against these various manifestations of factionalism. The more they fought, the clearer their minds became, and the brighter their eyes became. Many teachers and students used the Spring Festival as a day to fight selfishness and revise revisionism. The "Red Couple" activity also focused on fighting factionalism. The entire school's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff thus waged a "people's war" of stripping factionalism of its disguise, exposing its crimes, uprooting its poisonous roots, and raiding its lairs, making bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism a homeless dog with nowhere to hide. Chairman Mao's latest instructions were even more deeply ingrained in people's hearts, and the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination were increasingly consolidated. The entire school presented a vibrant revolutionary scene.

    通化师范学校建立革委会后大办毛泽东思想学习班
    彻底追歼派性　巩固革命大联合和三结合
    本报讯　吉林省通化市师范学校实现革命大联合和建立革命委员会以后，继续围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，进一步巩固了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    要巩固革命三结合必须继续围剿派性
    通化师范学校的革命师生，在建立学校的革命委员会之后，对毛泽东思想学习班重点应该抓什么的问题，发生了分歧。有人主张，学习班应当把增强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，继续作为主要内容。他们的理由是：现在两大派的组织形式虽然不存在了，但派性的阴魂未散，劣根未除。如果派性的流毒不肃清，它在适当的气候下还会兴妖作怪，危害革命事业。要巩固革命大联合和三结合，必须继续围剿派性。但有的人认为：既然过去已经围剿过派性，对立的两大派已经实现了革命大联合，学校的革命委员会已经建立起来，就不必再去斗派性了。当前要巩固革命三结合，首先是要把学生的情绪稳定下来。
    到底应该抓什么？人民解放军驻校毛泽东思想宣传队和学校革命委员会的同志一起，组织全校师生学习了毛主席的教导：“我们一定要建设一个集中的统一的党，一切无原则的派别斗争，都要清除干净。要使我们全党的步调整齐一致，为一个共同目标而奋斗，我们一定要反对个人主义和宗派主义。”学习了毛主席的教导，再对照本校的实际情况，大家的头脑清醒了，一致认识到：如果忽略了继续同头脑中派性这个危险的敌人作斗争，就不能巩固革命的大联合和三结合，就不能完成毛主席交给我们的更加艰巨伟大的战斗任务。
    于是，全校的毛泽东思想学习班，就把继续围剿派性列为中心内容，狠挖派性，狠批派性。三年二班的同学，挖出了自己在选举革命委员会的时候出现的派性，认识到资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的顽固性。有的同学说：革命委员会选举的那一天，本来事先学习了毛主席的有关教导，心情很舒畅，但在唱票时，听到连续唱出的都是对方组织的人名，心里就很不舒服，生怕对方组织占了上风；后来又听到连续唱自己组织人员的票，心情马上就舒畅了。这种心情的变化，就是说明派性还在思想深处作怪。革命师生在学习班里不但批判一些在行动上已明显表现出来的派性，还狠挖隐藏在思想深处的派性，把派性的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下。有些师生检查说：过去派旗在，干啥都走在前头；现在实现革命大联合和三结合了，派旗倒了，劲头就不象过去那么足了，甚至变成了“逍遥派”，这就是派性在作怪。
    经过这样一摆，大家的认识又提高了一步，大家看到，派性仍然在头脑里作怪，办学习班的主攻方向，必须继续放在斗派性上。
    认清派性的反动性，激发对派性的仇恨心
    但是，在学习班里有些人又流露出了对派性恨不起来的情绪，他们说：“这些一闪一现的派性思想，坏不了大事，斗不斗都无所谓。”
    这些同志对派性恨不起来的原因，主要是对派性的反动性认识不足。于是，学校革委会又组织大家学习毛主席的最新指示和《文汇报》社论《论派性的反动性》，各班级通过回忆派性的由来和发展，揭露派性的反动性。二年一班的同学们还写了首快板诗，生动地给派性画了个像。
    通过剥派性的画皮，列派性的罪状，大量的事实使革命师生们进一步认清了派性的反动性。他们说：派性这条毒蛇，在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的新形势下，起了党内一小撮走资派的别动队的作用，我们千万不能对它丧失革命警惕性。如果不提高警惕，听任派性泛滥，那么有朝一日，就可能使革命委员会，变成资产阶级派别斗争的议会，我们的胜利果实，就会被阶级敌人夺了去。蛀虫虽小，能钻空大树，派性虽是一闪念，却是三结合的一个隐患。
    派性无处藏身　三结合日益巩固
    对派性恨得越深，斗派性的劲头越足。广大革命师生对派性深恶痛绝，决心用斗资产阶级反动路线的狠劲，狠斗派性。革命委员会成员在学习班里首先带头向群众亮派性，斗派性，大讲自己斗派性的体会，有力地激发起群众斗派性的积极性。
    全校师生斗派性高度自觉，抓派性一闪念毫不放松。有一天，三年一班李莉英同学，发现领读毛主席语录的是对方组织的一个同学，她就不高兴，读的声音就小了。但她很快警觉到，这又是派性作怪，要赶快抓住它。当天，她就带着这个问题，反复学习毛主席的有关教导，狠斗了这一闪念。在学习班中，学生刘玉兰和刘凤兰还谈到，过去一听到有人批评本组织的缺点，立刻感到不舒服，这是护短、护派。这样越护越短，越护派性越严重。
    大家对这些形形色色的派性表现狠抓狠斗，越斗头脑越清醒，越斗眼睛越明亮。很多师生把春节当成斗私批修的战斗日。“一对红”活动也把斗派性作为活动重点。全校广大革命师生员工，就这样打了一场大剥派性画皮，大摆派性罪状，大拔派性毒根，大抄派性老窝的“人民战争”，使资产阶级、小资产阶级派性成了丧家之犬，无处藏身。毛主席的最新指示更加深入人心，革命的大联合和革命的三结合日益巩固，整个学校呈现出一派生气勃勃的革命景象。
