	Currently, in some places or units that have initially achieved revolutionary great unity, there is a mistaken view circulating: "We have achieved great unity here, there is no factionalism to oppose." Is this true? No.

	If it were true, why do some places or units split and then reunite, even restart "internal wars," and raise "factional flags" again?

	If it were true, why do some places or units appear to have merged several flags into one, but in reality, they are still clearly divided, smiling at each other in public, but secretly making many moves behind the scenes, appearing united but actually divided?

	If it were true, why do some places or units, after uniting, find that "seizing the revolution and promoting production" is not as effective as before, and some even say: "This kind of unity, doing things has no energy"?

	All these examples, aren't they proof that factionalism is still at work?

	That view of "united, no factionalism to oppose" is not only wrong but also very deceptive. It is an excuse used by those who create factionalism to cover up the fact that factionalism still exists in their minds with organizational unity. Organizational unity is only the first step in defeating factionalism. What is more important is to defeat factionalism in thought, which requires a long, tireless struggle.

	Without unity, oppose factionalism; with unity, still oppose factionalism. Carry the struggle to wipe out factionalism to the end, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely defeat factionalism!

### 联合了，还要反派性

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

    联合了，还要反派性
    当前，在某些初步实现革命大联合的地方或单位，流传着这样一种错误的论调：“我们这里已经实现大联合，没有什么派性可反了。”果真吗？否。
    如果真的这样，为什么有的地方、有的单位分而合，合而分，甚至重开“内战”，重插“派旗”？
    如果真的这样，为什么有的地方、有的单位表面上几杆旗变成了一杆旗，暗地里却依然泾渭分明，当面笑脸相迎，背后小动作层出不穷，貌合神离？
    如果真的这样，为什么有的地方、有的单位联合后，“抓革命，促生产”反而不如以前，甚至有人说：“这样联合，做事都没有劲”？
    诸如此类，难道不是派性还在作怪吗？
    那种“联合了，没有派性可反”的论调，不仅是错误的，而且欺骗性很大，是那些闹派性的人以组织上的联合来掩盖思想上依然存在派性的一种遁辞。组织上的联合，这仅仅是打倒派性的第一步，更重要的是打倒思想上的派性，这是需要进行长期的不疲倦斗争的。
    没有联合，要反派性；联合了，还要反派性。把围剿派性的斗争进行到底，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地打倒派性！　（江西《火线战报》）
