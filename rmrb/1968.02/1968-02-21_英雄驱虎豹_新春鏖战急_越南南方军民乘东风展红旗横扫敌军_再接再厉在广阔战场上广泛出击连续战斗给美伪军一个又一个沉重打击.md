Victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!

Heroes drive tigers and leopards, the New Year's offensive intensifies. The military and people of South Vietnam, riding the east wind, wave the red flag and sweep away the enemy forces. They continue to fight on the vast battlefield, launching widespread attacks and giving the U.S. puppet forces blow after blow.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 20th, in the midst of the triumphant songs of the brilliant victory of the New Year's offensive, the military and people of South Vietnam fight bravely and grow stronger with each battle. With the heroic spirit of continuous fighting and continuous victories, they press forward in great strides, sweep away the enemy's nests, and deal the U.S. puppet clique blow after blow.

The battle for Hue has raged for twenty days, with the golden star red and blue flags flying proudly.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces and the local people in the heroic ancient city of Hue have been fighting for twenty days and nights. Fearless of sacrifice and fatigue, they continued to attack the enemy on the 16th, 17th, and 18th, and repulsed the enemy's multiple ferocious counterattacks. They annihilated more than 700 enemy troops (including more than 400 American invaders and South Korean mercenaries), sank or damaged seven enemy military ships, shot down four planes, and destroyed or damaged four tanks. The glorious golden star red and blue flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam proudly flies on the flagpole of the ancient citadel, inspiring the military and people of Hue to achieve greater victories.

After suffering heavy losses of more than 500 troops on the 14th and 15th, the American invaders and their lackeys, on the morning of the 16th, gathered five battalions of troops to counterattack the West Gate, East Bank Gate, Upper Four Gate, and Me Chau Van Street of Hue City. They also dispatched planes and artillery to indiscriminately drop napalm and poison gas bombs on densely populated residential areas within the city and suburbs, brutally massacring the people.

However, the enemy's heinous crimes only further fueled the deep hatred and severe retribution of the military and people of Hue. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces bravely defended every street and every house, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy using rifles, grenades, and bayonets, preventing the enemy from advancing even a step. In the defense of the East Bank Gate, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces bravely charged into the enemy's ranks, using bayonets to annihilate batch after batch of enemies. More than 100 American invaders and South Korean mercenaries were killed in the streets, and the rest were so terrified that some even hid under the corpses of their comrades in a desperate attempt to save their lives. A three-person team of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, embodying the spirit of "grabbing the enemy by the waist and fighting," used every house, every intersection, and every obstacle to strike the enemy. Many U.S. puppet troops met their end under the grenades and bayonets of the three brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces.

At the same time, the people of Hue, who have risen up to fight, also fearlessly fought side by side with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces. The self-defense forces launched a fierce attack and annihilated dozens of thugs hiding in the former puppet provincial governor's lair. They also ambushed American troops near the Temple of National Protection and attacked the "pacification team" near the Long Tho outpost, just 300 meters away, annihilating two platoons of American invaders, shooting down one enemy plane, damaging one armored vehicle, and annihilating two companies of the puppet "pacification team."

In the face of the brave and tenacious military and people of Hue, the enemy's repeated counterattacks were all repulsed. The American invaders and Western news agencies admitted in despair: in Hue, the U.S. Marine Corps "has made virtually no progress," and the U.S. Marine Corps has suffered so many casualties in the week since arriving in Hue that it is "frightening."

The fierce battle in the Saigon region, the artillery heroes show their might.

The military and people of the Saigon-Gia Dinh region, who have been fighting in the heart of the enemy for nearly twenty days, have not given the enemy any respite. They have launched continuous attacks, striking the U.S. puppet clique with fear and confusion, leaving them at a loss. The U.S. puppet clique, which has been hit hard across the vast battlefield of South Vietnam, has been in a state of panic and chaos due to its inability to spare troops to defend the puppet regime's "capital." Some high-ranking officials of the invading U.S. forces in South Vietnam could not help but lament: they "cannot guarantee" the safety of Saigon and believe that stopping the artillery attacks of the People's Liberation Armed Forces is a "very difficult" task.

From the 17th to the 19th, the military and people of the Saigon-Gia Dinh region launched a series of coordinated and fierce attacks on the New Mountain One U.S. Air Force base, the puppet police headquarters, the Phu Lam radio center, and other important enemy targets around Saigon. On the morning of the 17th, the night of the 18th, and the morning of the 19th, the New Mountain One Airport was repeatedly hit by the fierce artillery of the People's Liberation Armed Forces. Many American invaders were killed or wounded, and many planes and facilities were destroyed. On the morning of the 17th, as soon as the attacking artillery fire stopped, the infantry of the People's Liberation Armed Forces immediately rushed into the airport, annihilating and capturing more than 100 American invaders, most of whom were pilots and technicians. Just at 5 a.m. on the 19th, a single artillery shell from the People's Liberation Armed Forces annihilated 24 American bandits in the waiting room.

During this period, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region also captured many enemy outposts around Saigon, including the puppet military training camp of Quang Trung and the New Thoi outpost northwest of New Mountain One Airport. The command post of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division in Go Vap District and the enemy artillery positions in Phuong Dinh Commune, Binh Duong Province were also attacked by the People's Liberation Armed Forces. On the morning of the 18th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Gia Dinh Province also hit two U.S. military supply ships 11 kilometers east of Saigon, causing them to burn fiercely.

The military and people of Thu Duc to the northeast of Saigon and Bien Hoa to the north simultaneously launched fierce attacks on the puppet 5th Division's 8th Regiment's 1st Battalion stationed near the 13th Highway in the Chuong My District north of Thu Duc City, the Phu Loi Airport in Thu Duc Province, and the Bien Hoa Airport and Long Binh logistics base in Bien Hoa Province. According to preliminary reports, after more than 30 minutes of extremely brave and clever fighting, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Thu Duc Province annihilated the puppet 5th Division's 8th Regiment's 1st Battalion and seized many weapons and military supplies.

Victory reports pour in from the southern battlefield, the people's armed forces bravely fight the enemy.

The sound of the People's Liberation Armed Forces' guns and cannons continues to echo across the vast southern battlefield. In the early hours of the 18th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Chau Doc, Phuoc Long, Binh Duong, and Chau Doc provinces launched fierce attacks on a series of enemy cities, outposts, and airports. Immediately afterwards, in the early morning of the 19th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces riding on the Mekong Delta launched simultaneous artillery attacks on the provincial capitals of five provinces, including Ben Tre, Vinh Long, Binh Duong, Di An, and Chau Doc, and three county seats.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the early hours of the 16th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Chau Doc Province attacked Chau Doc City, heavily striking the enemy's military and political institutions within the city, occupying some streets, and controlling three-quarters of Chau Doc Airport. Some helicopters attempted to take off and escape but were shot down by the People's Liberation Armed Forces.

On the same day, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Phuoc Long Province, divided into multiple units, quickly controlled many streets and the city center of Phuoc Long City after a few minutes of fighting. They swiftly captured the enemy command post, destroyed the enemy's communication network, cut off the enemy's connection with Saigon, occupied the airport, surrounded the puppet government's administrative agencies, and annihilated a large number of enemies. At present, the military and people of Phuoc Long Province have controlled most of Phuoc Long City and are continuing to pursue and attack the enemy.

In the early hours of the 17th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Binh Duong Province once again attacked the enemy's military targets within the provincial capital of Thuan An City. According to preliminary reports, the People's Liberation Armed Forces destroyed many enemy barracks, controlled the Thuan An and New Market districts of the city, annihilated many enemies, and seized many weapons. This is the fourth attack by the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Binh Duong Province on this city since February 1st.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam have written down their oaths, expressing their determination to press forward with victory, continue to launch more fierce and continuous attacks on the U.S. invaders and their lackeys, and achieve the final victory.

    胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！
    英雄驱虎豹  新春鏖战急
    越南南方军民乘东风展红旗横扫敌军
    再接再厉在广阔战场上广泛出击连续战斗给美伪军一个又一个沉重打击
    据新华社河内二十日电　在新春攻势辉煌胜利的凯歌声中，越南南方军民越战越勇，越战越强，他们以连续战斗、连续胜利的英雄气概，再接再厉，大踏步地前进，横扫敌巢，给予美伪集团一个接一个的沉重打击。
    顺化激战二十天，金星红蓝旗傲然飘扬
    在英雄的古城顺化市坚持战斗二十个日日夜夜的人民解放武装力量战士和当地人民，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳，在十六日、十七日和十八日继续向敌人展开进攻，并打退了敌人的多次疯狂反扑，又消灭美伪军七百多名（其中美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军共四百多名），击沉击伤敌人军用船只七艘，击落飞机四架，击毁击伤坦克四辆。越南南方民族解放阵线光荣的金星红蓝旗，高高地在古城堡的旗台上迎风飘扬，鼓舞着顺化市军民去夺取更大的胜利。
    美国侵略者及其走狗在十四日和十五日两天遭到沉重打击被消灭五百多名之后，十六日上午又纠集了五个营的兵力，向顺化市西门、东波门、上四门和梅叔鸾街进行反扑，并且出动飞机、大炮，丧心病狂地对市内和郊区的居民稠密区投掷凝固汽油弹和毒气弹，残暴地屠杀人民。
    但是，敌人的滔天罪行只能更加激起顺化市军民对它们的深仇大恨，给予它们以更加严厉的惩罚。人民解放武装力量战士英勇地保卫着每条街道，每座房屋，用步枪、手榴弹和刺刀同敌人展开激烈的白刃战，使疯狂反扑的敌人无法前进一步。在守卫东波门的战斗中，解放武装力量战士勇猛地冲进敌人队伍，用刺刀消灭一批又一批的敌人，一百多名美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军被打死在街道上，其余的吓得丧魂落魄，有的竟把头钻进它们同伙的尸堆下面妄图保命。解放武装力量的一个三人小组，发扬“揪住敌人腰带打”的精神，利用每座房屋、每个路口和每个障碍物痛击敌人，许多美伪军在解放武装力量三个英勇战士的手榴弹和刺刀下送了命。
    与此同时，奋起斗争的顺化市人民群众也奋不顾身地与解放武装力量战士并肩战斗。自卫队猛烈袭击并消灭了数十名隐藏在原伪省长巢穴里的恶棍，他们还在保国庙附近截击美军，和袭击距隆寿据点仅三百米处的“绥靖队”，歼灭美国侵略军两个班，击落敌机一架，击伤装甲车一辆，消灭伪“绥靖队”的两个排。
    在英勇顽强的顺化市军民面前，敌人一次又一次的反扑全部遭到失败。美国侵略者和西方通讯社沮丧地供认：在顺化，美国海军陆战队“实际上毫无进展”，美国海军陆战队从开到顺化一周来，伤亡之多“叫人害怕”。
    西贡地区攻坚战，神炮手大显威风
    战斗在敌人心脏地区的西贡—嘉定军民，近二十天来始终不给敌人以任何喘息的机会，接连发动进攻，打得美伪集团惊魂不定，束手无策。在南越广阔的战场上到处都遭到痛击的美伪集团，由于抽不出兵力来保卫傀儡集团的“首都”，已陷于一片惊恐混乱。侵越美军的一些高级官员禁不住哀叹：他们“保证不了”西贡的安全，认为要阻挡解放武装力量的炮击，是一件“非常困难”的事。
    从二月十七日到十九日，西贡—嘉定地区军民又向新山一美国空军基地、伪警察总署、富林无线电中心和西贡周围的敌人其它许多重要目标，发动了配合一致的猛烈袭击。在十七日清晨、十八日夜间和十九日清晨，新山一机场接连不断地遭到解放武装力量猛烈炮火的袭击，许多美国侵略军被打死打伤，许多飞机和设施被摧毁。十七日晨，当进攻的炮火刚刚停止的时候，解放武装力量的步兵马上冲进机场，消灭和俘虏了一百多名美国侵略军，其中绝大部分是驾驶员和技术人员。仅在十九日清晨五点钟，解放武装力量打的一发炮弹，就消灭了候机室中的二十四个美国强盗。
    在这期间，西贡—嘉定地区人民解放武装力量还攻占了西贡周围的许多敌军据点，其中包括伪军的光忠军事训练营和新山一机场西北的新时据点等。美国第二十五步兵师在古芝县的指挥所和平新县平正乡的敌军炮兵阵地也遭到解放武装力量的袭击。十八日上午，嘉定省解放武装力量还在西贡东面十一公里的地方，击中两艘美国的军火运输船，使它起火猛烈燃烧。
    西贡东北的土龙木和北面的边和两省军民在西贡—嘉定地区军民向美伪集团的一系列重要基地发动进攻的同时，也向驻扎在土龙木市北面周城县地区第十三号公路旁的伪军第五师第八团第一营和土龙木省富利机场以及边和省边和机场和龙平后勤基地发动猛烈袭击。据初步消息，经过三十多分钟无比勇敢、机智的战斗，土龙木省解放武装力量歼灭了伪军第五师第八团第一营，缴获许多武器和军用物资。
    南部战场捷报频传，人民武装英勇杀敌
    人民解放武装力量进攻的枪炮声，继续响彻辽阔的南部地区各个战场。十七日深夜和十八日凌晨，朔庄、福隆、建丰、朱笃等省人民解放武装力量向敌人的一系列城市、据点和机场发动了猛烈进攻。紧接着，在十九日清晨，驰骋在湄公河三角洲上的人民解放武装力量，又同时向槟椥、永隆、建丰、迪石、朔庄等五个省的省会和三个县城发起炮轰。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道：十六日凌晨朔庄省人民解放武装力量攻进了朔庄市，沉重地打击了市内的敌人军政机构，占领了一些街区，并且控制了朔庄机场的三分之二地区。一些直升飞机妄图起飞逃跑，当场被解放武装力量击落三架。
    同一天凌晨，福隆省人民解放武装力量，分成多路，经过几分钟的战斗，就控制了福隆市的许多街道和市中心区，并且迅速攻克敌军指挥所，破坏敌人的通讯联络网，切断敌人同西贡的联系，占领机场，包围伪政权行政机关，消灭了大批敌人。目前，福隆省军民已经控制了福隆市的大部分地区，正在继续乘胜追击敌人。
    十七日深夜，建丰省人民解放武装力量再次向这个省的省会高岭市内的敌人军事目标发动进攻。据初步消息，人民解放武装力量摧毁了敌军的许多营房，控制了这个市的求笃区、新市区，消灭许多敌人，缴获许多武器。这是自今年二月一日以来建丰省人民解放武装力量对这个城市发动的第四次进攻。
