The heroic soldiers and people of Laos, with a fierce offensive, have launched extensive attacks and achieved a splendid victory by annihilating 4,090 enemy forces in January this year.

In January, the Lao patriotic soldiers and people annihilated 1,647 enemy troops, wounded 167, captured and forced the surrender of 2,102, and completely wiped out two enemy companies. Among the annihilated enemy forces were over 300 military officers.

In January, the Lao patriotic soldiers and people also shot down and destroyed 14 enemy aircraft, sank three motorboats and motorized boats, blew up two ammunition depots, and seized over 1,200 pieces of various weapons, 800 tons of ammunition, and a large amount of military supplies.

During the battles, they liberated the important strategic region of Nam Bao and 40 villages.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Khorat on February 14, the Lao patriotic armed forces, inspired by their great victory in Nam Bao, have frequently launched attacks in recent times, inflicting heavy losses on U.S. imperialism and its Laotian lackeys, achieving new victories.

The report said that on February 7, the Lao patriotic armed forces blew up an important bridge on the Shepone River, 40 kilometers south of Thakhek. The bridge, 141 meters long, is a key bridge on the enemy's main transportation line, the 13th Highway, which runs north-south through Laos.

The report said that on January 29, the Lao patriotic armed forces in Xieng Ngeun Province (now Xieng Khouang Province) recaptured the Mang Nong area, which had been illegally occupied by rightist forces. Preliminary reports indicate that the patriotic armed forces killed and wounded many enemy troops and seized a large amount of weapons and other war materials.

In the province of Xieng Khouang, on January 4, the patriotic armed forces launched a fierce attack on a battalion of rightist Laotian troops sent to reinforce the Ku Hai area, annihilating 179 enemy troops.

In the newly established 90th Joint District of Xam Neua Province, local armed forces and guerrilla units bravely counterattacked the encroachment by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys on this region for 20 days starting from January 21, annihilating 78 enemy troops and seizing a batch of weapons and a large amount of military supplies.
