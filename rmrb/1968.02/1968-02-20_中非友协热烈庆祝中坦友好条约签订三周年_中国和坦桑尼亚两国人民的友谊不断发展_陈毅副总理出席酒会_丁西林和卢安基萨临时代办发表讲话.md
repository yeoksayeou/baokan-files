New China News Agency, February 19th: At the reception held by the China-Africa Friendship Association today, representatives of the revolutionary masses of the capital and Tanzanian friends in Beijing jointly warmly celebrated the third anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Tanzanian Friendship Treaty, and the continuous consolidation and development of the friendship between the two peoples.

Vice Premier Chen Yi and relevant officials Ji Pengfei and Xie Huai attended the reception.

Vice President of the China-Africa Friendship Association, Ding Xilin, spoke at the reception, enthusiastically praising the friendship between the Chinese and Tanzanian peoples, which is based on anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. He said that imperialism and neo-colonialism do not want us to unite, cooperate, and be friendly. We must respond to them by strengthening unity, friendship, and cooperation. The signing of the Sino-Tanzanian Friendship Treaty is a heavy blow to imperialism and neo-colonialism.

Ding Xilin praised the Tanzanian people, under the leadership of President Nyerere, for their victories in consolidating national independence, opposing imperialism and neo-colonialism, and supporting the struggle for African national independence. He also praised the achievements of the Tanzanian people in developing national economy and culture according to the Arusha Declaration, relying on self-reliance. He said that the Chinese people are delighted by every victory achieved by the Tanzanian people. The Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and resolutely support the Tanzanian people in carrying out the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial revolutionary struggle to the end.

Tanzanian Chargé d'Affaires Luankisa was invited to attend the reception and delivered a passionate speech. He said that the friendship between Tanzania and China is a great friendship. Our common enemies attempt to shake our friendship, but we tell them that their attempts are in vain. The friendship between Tanzania and China is unshakable by any force. The Chargé d'Affaires said that the enemies of the Chinese people are also the enemies of the Tanzanian people. The two peoples must unite to protect our friendship.

Luankisa enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, saying that the Tanzanian people congratulate the Chinese people on their great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao is not only a great victory for the Chinese people but also a great victory for the Tanzanian people, the African people, and the people of the world. This victory has terrified imperialism and neo-colonialism. The Chargé d'Affaires said that the Tanzanian people believe in Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely support the struggle of the Chinese people.

A Chinese story film was shown at the reception.
