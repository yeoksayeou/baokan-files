The former Peking Union Medical College was established by Americans. The American imperialists have always boasted that this is "American friendship towards China." Bah! This is sheer bandit logic, turning aggression into friendship. Peking Union Medical College was a stronghold of American imperialist cultural aggression against China, a laboratory and killing ground set up by American imperialists under the guise of "charity."

The boss of Peking Union Medical College was the Rockefeller Foundation, the largest of the eight American monopolies, a "coal king" with the blood of laborers around the world on his hands. They admitted: "To expand spiritual influence by spending some money can achieve more than other methods." "I believe that supporting universities with one million dollars is more politically powerful for the Chiang (Kai-shek) government than maintaining an army with two million dollars. Because the army can mutiny; students trained in this way are more docile and reliable." This means that the American imperialists established Peking Union Medical College to cultivate a group of lackeys as tools for their rule over China.

The American imperialists' goals were not entirely in vain. It was the graduates of Peking Union Medical College who controlled the health affairs of the Kuomintang regime in China. Before 1936, 25% of the graduates of Peking Union Medical College were health officials in the Kuomintang reactionary government. Even now, the "Director of the Health Department" and the "Health Representative to the United Nations" of the Chiang bandits are still graduates of Peking Union Medical College. At the time of national liberation, a considerable number of students from Peking Union Medical College fled with their masters to America or Taiwan, becoming the most shameful traitors and collaborators. Among those who remained on the mainland, some still held reactionary political positions. From these circumstances, we can clearly see that those educated under imperialist enslavement were not only a bourgeois academic and technical force but also a bourgeois political force. What is infuriating is that some of them were elevated to the status of "authorities" and "ancestors" by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, becoming the monopolists of the medical field in New China.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out incisively: "American imperialism, compared to other imperialist countries, has for a long time paid more attention to spiritual aggression activities," "Many famous schools in our country, such as Yenching and Peking Union Medical College, were established by Americans." Peking Union Medical College is a product of American imperialist policy towards China.

Such a stronghold of American imperialist cultural aggression has revived in the People's Republic of China ten years after its establishment. The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, learning from the counter-revolutionary experience of their predecessors, were unwilling to let the old Peking Union Medical College be disbanded. In 1959, they established the only eight-year system school in the country—China Medical University—on the basis of the old Peking Union Medical College. This school has been implementing a thoroughly counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line since its establishment. The "plan" of the medical university clearly states: "Ensure that all the experiences of the old Peking Union Medical College are inherited by us drop by drop and further developed and improved under new conditions." They gathered the "old Peking Union Medical College team," from the school system, teaching plan, teaching content, teaching methods, to the elimination system, tutor system, training methods, and even the material equipment and student life arrangements, all strictly followed the so-called "Peking Union Medical College standards." China Medical University became the reincarnated body of the old Peking Union Medical College.

We denounce with indignation the culprit who revived the old Peking Union Medical College, the Chinese Khrushchev. He said: "The old universities of the past" have made many achievements in raising the cultural, scientific, and cognitive levels of the Chinese people." Look, this is just like when Acheson in the White Paper shamelessly turned aggression into friendship, saying it "introduced new ideas." The agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in the educational field, Lu Dingyi, even more blatantly said for the revival of the old Peking Union Medical College: "Everything can be done according to the old Peking Union Medical College." And said: "This school will produce rightists, at most only sixty a year (the medical university only enrolls sixty students a year), even if they run to America, it's nothing to worry about." Look, their reactionary purpose in establishing China Medical University is exactly the same as that of the American imperialists at that time. Reviving the old Peking Union Medical College is part of the Chinese Khrushchev and his lackeys' evil plan to restore capitalism in China. From Rockefeller to the Chinese Khrushchev, the former is the supreme director of the old Peking Union Medical College, and the latter is the backer of the ghosts and monsters of China Medical University. The roles have changed, but their counter-revolutionary purposes are the same: to revive the old Peking Union Medical College. This once again proves that the Chinese Khrushchev is not only an agent of the domestic bourgeoisie but also a running dog and comprador of imperialism.

We must not let the Chinese Khrushchev's plot succeed. We must thoroughly overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. The medical university must undergo thorough revolution, and let the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shine upon China Medical University.

    从洛克菲勒到中国赫鲁晓夫
    中国医科大学红小兵
    过去的协和医学院是美国人开办的。美帝国主义者一贯吹嘘这是“美国对中国的友谊”。呸！这是十足的强盗逻辑，硬把侵略说成友谊。协和是美帝国主义对中国人民进行文化侵略的堡垒，是美帝国主义借办“慈善”事业为名而设立的试验场和杀人场。
    协和的老板，是美国八大垄断财团中最大的“煤油大王”、双手沾满世界劳动人民鲜血的洛克菲勒财团。他们自己供认过：“为了扩张精神上的影响花一些钱，能够比用别的方法收获得更多”。“我相信用一百万（元）来支持各大学对蒋（介石）政府来说，其政治上所产生的力量比用二百万（元）来维持军队会大得多。因为军队可以叛变；至于循此而培养的学生则更为驯服可靠。”这就是说，美帝国主义办协和，是为了培养一批洋奴，作为他们统治中国的工具。
    美帝国主义的目的并没有完全落空。正是协和的毕业生，控制了国民党时代中国的卫生大权。一九三六年前的协和毕业生中，有百分之二十五在国民党反动政府里作卫生官。至今蒋匪“台湾卫生署署长”、蒋匪“驻联合国卫生代表”，都仍然是协和的毕业生。全国解放的时候，协和学生中有相当一部分人，和他们的主子一起滚到美国或者台湾，当了最可耻的叛国投敌分子。留在大陆的人中，有一些人还坚持反动的政治立场。从这些情况我们可以清楚地看到，在帝国主义的奴化教育下培养出来的，不仅是一支资产阶级学术技术队伍，而且是一支资产阶级政治力量。令人气愤的是，其中有些人竟被党内一小撮走资派捧上了“权威”、“祖师爷”的宝座，成了新中国医学界的垄断者。
    伟大领袖毛主席一针见血地指出：“美帝国主义比较其他帝国主义国家，在很长的时期内，更加注重精神侵略方面的活动”，“我国许多有名的学校如燕京、协和……等，都是美国人设立的。”协和正是美帝侵华政策的产物。
    这样一个美帝国主义的文化侵略堡垒，竟然在中华人民共和国成立十年后死灰复燃了。中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙吸收其前辈的反革命经验，不甘心于旧协和的停办，于一九五九年在旧协和的基础上，创办了全国唯一的八年制学校——中国医科大学。这所学校从建校开始就执行着一条彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义教育路线。医大的“规划”中明文规定：“务使旧协和所有的经验点滴不漏地逐步为我们继承，并在新的情况下加以发扬和提高。”他们拼凑起了“老协和的班底”，从学制、教学计划、教学内容、教学方法，到淘汰制、导师制、培养手段，直到物质设备、学生的生活安排，都完全按照所谓“协和标准”。中国医科大学成了旧协和借尸还魂的躯壳。
    我们怀着满腔愤怒控诉复辟旧协和的罪魁中国赫鲁晓夫。他胡说什么：“过去的旧大学”“对于提高中国人民的文化水平、科学水平、认识水平，是有很多成绩的。”请看，这和当年艾奇逊在白皮书里，死皮赖脸地把侵略说成是友谊，是“介绍了新的思想进来”，何其相似。中国赫鲁晓夫在教育界的代理人陆定一则更加露骨地为旧协和招魂说：中国医科大学“一切都可以照旧协和办”。并且说：“这个学校将来出右派每年最多不过六十个（医大每年只招六十个学生），甚至跑到美国去了，也没什么了不起。”看吧，他们开办中国医科大学的反动目的和当年的美帝国主义如出一辙。恢复旧协和，正是中国赫鲁晓夫及其娄罗们在中国复辟资本主义罪恶计划的一个组成部分。从洛克菲勒到中国赫鲁晓夫，前者是旧协和的太上董事长，后者是中国医科大学牛鬼蛇神的总后台，角色换了，他们的反革命目的却是一致的：恢复旧协和。这就又一次证明，中国赫鲁晓夫不仅是国内资产阶级的代理人，而且是帝国主义的走狗和买办。
    我们绝不能让中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋得逞。必须彻底打倒中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，必须彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。医大必须彻底革命，让毛泽东思想的阳光，照彻中国医科大学。
