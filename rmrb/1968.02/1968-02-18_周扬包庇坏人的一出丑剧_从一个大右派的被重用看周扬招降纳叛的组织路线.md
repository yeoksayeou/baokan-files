For over a decade, China's Khrushchev and his agents in the literary and artistic circles, such as Zhou Yang, have been recruiting and absorbing traitors, forming cliques, and shielding traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, even those whose crimes have been thoroughly exposed.

The way Zhou Yang and his gang have gone to great lengths to shield and promote Zhong Dianci is a shocking example.

Who is Zhong Dianci? He is a notorious rightist who was named and criticized by our great leader Chairman Mao in 1957, and the author of the infamous "Drums and Cymbals in Film." However, this thorough counter-revolutionary was treated as a treasure by Zhou Yang and his gang, who shielded him in every way and promoted him vigorously.

From this example, we can see the true nature of the organizational line that Zhou Yang and his gang have been pushing in the literary and artistic circles.

The Fake Criticism of 1957

During the great anti-rightist struggle of 1957, this rightist, Zhong Dianci, was exposed. However, Zhou Yang and his gang openly defied our great leader Chairman Mao's criticism of Zhong Dianci and defended him, claiming that Zhong Dianci's problems were merely "serious bourgeois individualism," "bourgeois artistic views," and that his "professional achievements far outstripped his political progress." Is this really the case? Let Zhong Dianci's own rightist statements answer that. After the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, it was this very Zhong Dianci who boasted: "I am a 'reformer' like Khrushchev," and loudly proclaimed: "There can be a legal opposition within the Party." He harbored deep hatred for the dictatorship of the proletariat, viciously cursing us by saying, "We are not as good as the United States or the most corrupt dynasty in Chinese history." He maliciously slandered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, spitting out: "I do not advocate lying on 'The Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' or behind it." After being severely criticized by Chairman Mao, this rightist became even more ferocious, launching a fierce counterattack. He gritted his teeth and said, "After 'Drums and Cymbals in Film,' we must have another explosion!" Such a thoroughly reactionary scoundrel—is his problem really just one of "individualism"? Just one of "artistic views"? Just one of "professional achievements far outstripping political progress"? No, absolutely not! This is a thorough counter-revolutionary!

However, Zhou Yang and his gang tried their best to cover up his counter-revolutionary crimes, cunningly staging a farce of fake criticism and real shielding. As Lu Xun said, "Once they put on a show, the stage set in front is always different from the true face behind the scenes." Zhou Yang and his gang criticized Zhong Dianci on stage in a so-called "serious" manner; behind the scenes, Zhou Yang specially invited Zhong Dianci to his home, comforting him, encouraging him, and boosting his morale. Zhou Yang said, "You can still write articles, don't be discouraged," "The Chairman criticized you, so what? You've already played your role. If it weren't for your 'Drums and Cymbals in Film,' I wouldn't have criticized you in my talk with the Wenhui Daily, and if I didn't criticize you, I would have become rightist!" These few words are a perfect confession of Zhou Yang and his gang's treacherous two-faced nature, vividly exposing the ugly faces of these counter-revolutionary two-faced characters.

Promoting Zhong Dianci to Rise Again

In 1961, before Zhong Dianci's reform-through-labor period was over, Zhou Yang ordered him to be transferred back to Beijing and instructed the relevant departments to "properly arrange his work." Thus, this unrepentant rightist, under Zhou Yang's protection, swaggered back into the old Film Association. At Zhou Yang's command, his accomplices Xia Yan, Chen Huangmei, Yuan Wenshu, and the capitalist-roaders within the old Film Association showed him great concern, not only providing him with high-level material enjoyment but also giving him special political treatment. At first, this rightist, who was favored, was still a bit cautious in public appearances, but Chen Huangmei immediately said, "Don't keep your distance from people, that's not good for you," and if he felt "embarrassed," Chen Huangmei and Yuan Wenshu could "accompany" him when watching movies. True to their word, a rightist who had not yet had his hat removed was watched movies with the "Deputy Minister of Culture" and the "First Secretary of the Film Association" on either side, a rare satirical scene! The First Secretary of the old Film Association, Yuan Wenshu, even secretly sent party documents to this rightist to read; another secretary was even more shameless, visiting Zhong Dianci, treating him to meals, and even apologizing, saying: "We were wrong to criticize you in the past, and today we want to 'withdraw' it!"

One farce after another, and the climax came when they removed Zhong Dianci's rightist hat. To deceive the public, the capitalist-roaders within the old Film Association first instructed their trusted followers to create public opinion, saying that Zhong Dianci's performance in the labor camp was "not bad" and that he could have his hat removed. Then they held a party group meeting to discuss it. The capitalist-roaders within the party said, "This person is still useful; he is not well, we should save him, otherwise he will collapse." Thus, they unanimously passed the resolution, and after approval by the old Propaganda Department, Zhong Dianci was officially back in the "revolutionary" ranks! Did Zhong Dianci really reform? No, this scoundrel's reactionary nature did not change at all. During this period, he wrote many obscure reactionary poems, saying, "All predecessors were rightists, who knows my intentions," "Knowing the ice is a thousand feet deep in the north, why not plant by the West Lake." Listen, isn't this saying: Knowing that the dictatorship of the proletariat is so "cruel" and "a thousand feet deep in ice," why not run to the "warm spring" of capitalist or revisionist countries? This is a complete confession of a traitor! Such a dark psychology, such reactionary cries, Zhou Yang and the capitalist-roaders within the old Film Association thought it was a "good performance" and that he was still "useful." This exposed their secret, what they said was "still useful" was just that this mad dog could serve their counter-revolutionary evil deeds.

Why did Zhou Yang and his gang shield and promote Zhong Dianci?

The reason is clear: they used rich material and political treatment to raise this mad dog because this mad dog knows how to "bite people," and can be used to attack the Party and socialism, serving as the vanguard and spearhead of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary restoration.

As soon as this rightist arrived at the old Film Association, the editor-in-chief of the counter-revolutionary book "History of Chinese Film Development" sent the proofs to him for review, respectfully seeking his advice. This rightist flattered, "It's well written, very educational. If it had come out a few years earlier, I wouldn't have made such big mistakes." Soon, he was placed in the editorial department of "Film Scripts." Yuan Wenshu personally instructed, "This person has experience in the profession and can help with some ideas." Zhong Dianci did not disappoint their expectations. As soon as he arrived at "Film Scripts," he loudly proclaimed: "Publishing should be adventurous," saying that Zhou Yang had once told him, "If you do it this way, you can achieve great merit." What "adventurous," what "achieve great merit," in one sentence, it is to "adventure" in counter-revolutionary risks and "achieve great merit" for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism!

Zhong Dianci once boasted that he wanted to write a book on "Film Aesthetics." What is the purpose of writing "Film Aesthetics"? Zhong Dianci confessed: "My 'Drums and Cymbals in Film' was just the beginning of my revision of 'The Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.' My more planned anti-Party activities are yet to come, which is the 'Film Aesthetics' that I planned to write." Zhou Yang, Yuan Wenshu, and their gang brought Zhong Dianci to the old Film Association precisely to let him write "Film Aesthetics" to realize their anti-Party wish!

After Zhou Yang and his gang removed Zhong Dianci's rightist hat, they even planned to promote him to the position of deputy editor-in-chief of the "Film Art" editorial department and prepare to bring him back into the Party. However, the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shattered their beautiful dream!

For more than a decade, Zhou Yang and his gang have been using various methods and channels to recruit a large number of ghosts and snakes like Zhong Dianci, creating conditions for the organizational restoration of capitalism.

The organizational line serves the political line. The facts of class struggle show that the reason why the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art has been able to run rampant in the literary and artistic circles for more than a decade is that China's Khrushchev and his agents, Zhou Yang and his gang, have been pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist organizational line of recruiting and absorbing traitors, forming cliques, placing trusted followers, and shielding bad elements. Thus, they formed "a counter-revolutionary faction hidden in the revolutionary ranks, an underground independent kingdom," controlling the power of various departments in the literary and artistic circles, usurping the political power of our proletariat!

To thoroughly smash China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary restoration plot, we must thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary organizational line, continue to launch fierce attacks on all exposed and unexposed class enemies. Thoroughly clean up the literary and artistic teams and strive to build a truly proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic team that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    周扬包庇坏人的一出丑剧
    ——从一个大右派的被重用看周扬招降纳叛的组织路线
    景旗
    十几年来，中国赫鲁晓夫和他在文艺界的代理人周扬之流，在文艺界招降纳叛，结党营私，包庇叛徒、特务、反革命分子，甚至早已查清的坏蛋。
    周扬一伙千方百计包庇和重用钟惦棐，就是一个触目惊心的例子。
    钟惦棐是什么人？是一九五七年被我们伟大领袖毛主席点名批判的大右派，是臭名昭著的《电影的锣鼓》的炮制者。但是，这样一个彻头彻尾的反革命分子，周扬一伙却视为宝贝，百般包庇，极力重用。
    借一斑可窥全豹。从钟惦棐的例子，我们可以看出周扬一伙在文艺界推行的究竟是什么样的组织路线。
    一九五七年的假批判
    在伟大的一九五七年反右派运动中，钟惦棐这个大右派被揪了出来。但是周扬一伙公然对抗我们伟大领袖毛主席对钟惦棐的批判，极力为他辩护，说什么钟惦棐的问题仅仅是“严重的资产阶级个人主义”，“资产阶级文艺观点”，“业务上的进展，远远超过了他在政治上的开展”等等。事情果真如此吗？还是用钟惦棐自己的右派言论来回答吧。苏修二十大以后，就是这个钟惦棐，拍着胸脯狂妄宣称：他是赫鲁晓夫“革新派”，疯狂叫嚣：“党内可以有合法的反对派”。他对无产阶级专政怀着刻骨的仇恨，恶毒咒骂我们“不如美国和中国最腐败的一个王朝”；他肆意诽谤战无不胜的毛泽东思想，唾沫四溅地叫嚷：“我不主张躺在《讲话》上面，或者躺在《讲话》后面”。这个右派分子在受到毛主席的严厉批判后，更加凶相毕露，猖狂反扑，他咬牙切齿地说：“要在《电影的锣鼓》以后，再来一次爆破”！这样一个反动透顶的家伙，难道只是什么“个人主义”的问题吗？只是什么“文艺观点”的问题吗？只是什么“业务上的进展，远远超过了他在政治上的开展”吗？不是，决不是，这是一个地地道道的反革命！
    然而周扬一伙却极力掩盖他的反革命罪行，阴险地玩弄了一场假批判、真包庇的丑剧。就象鲁迅所说：“一做戏，则前台的架子，总与后台的面目不相同。”周扬之流在前台对钟惦棐进行着所谓“严肃”的批判；后台呢，周扬特意把钟惦棐请到家里，又是抚慰，又是鼓励，又是打气。周扬说：“文章还可以写嘛，情绪不要低落”，“主席批评你，那有什么，你已起了你的作用了嘛！如果不是你的《电影的锣鼓》的话，我在给《文汇报》的谈话里也就不会批评你了，如果不批评你的话，我不就成了右倾了！”这几句话，真是一个绝妙的舍车保帅的自供状，它活活勾画出了反革命两面派周扬之流的丑恶嘴脸。
    扶植钟惦棐东山再起
    一九六一年，钟惦棐的劳改期还未满，周扬就指定把他调回北京，并慎重指示有关部门“应妥善安排工作”。于是，这个屡教不改的大右派在周扬的庇护下，大摇大摆地走进了旧电影协会。周扬的同伙夏衍、陈荒煤、袁文殊以及旧影协的党内走资派们，在周扬的吩咐下，对这个大右派关怀备至，不但给钟惦棐以高级的物质享受，而且给他以特殊的政治待遇。开始，这个受宠若惊的大右派在公众场合露面还有些顾忌，但陈荒煤马上说：“不要对人保持距离，这样对自己不利”，如果觉得“难为情”，以后看电影时他和袁文殊可以“陪同”。真是说到做到，一个尚未摘掉帽子的大右派看电影，左右陪着“文化部副部长”和“影协第一书记”，真是一幅难得的讽刺画！旧影协第一书记袁文殊还竟然把党内密件偷偷地送给这个大右派看；另一个书记更是丑态百出，对钟惦棐又是登门拜访，又是请客吃饭，甚至向他赔礼道歉，说：过去对你的批判错了，今天要“收回”！
    一幕幕的丑剧演下去，而高潮则在给钟惦棐摘右派帽子。为了掩人耳目，旧影协的党内走资派先指使他们的亲信大造舆论，说什么钟惦棐在农场劳改表现“不错”，“可以摘帽子”。然后就开党组会议讨论，党内走资派们竟然说：“这个人还有用处，他身体不好，应当救救他，不然就垮。”于是强行一致通过，最后经旧中宣部批准，钟惦棐就算正式回到了“革命”行列！难道钟惦棐真的痛改前非了吗？没有，这个家伙的反动本性一点也没有改变。就在这个时期，他写了许多晦涩的反动诗，说：“前人皆作右，安知我心意”，“既知北国冰千丈，何不西子湖边栽”。你听，这不是在说：早知无产阶级专政对他如此“严酷无情”，如此“冰千丈”，何不跑到“温暖如春”的资本主义或修正主义的国家去呢？完全是一个叛国分子的自白！如此阴暗的心理，如此反动的叫嚣，周扬和旧影协的党内走资派们却认为表现“不错”，“还有用处”，这倒是一语道破了他们的秘密，他们说的所谓“还有用处”，不过是这条疯狗可以为他们的反革命罪恶勾当效劳而已。
    周扬一伙包庇、重用钟惦棐的用意何在？
    问题十分明白，他们所以要用丰厚的物质待遇和政治待遇豢养着这条疯狗，就是因为这条疯狗很会“咬人”，可以用来向党向社会主义进攻，充当中国赫鲁晓夫反革命复辟的马前卒、急先锋。
    这个大右派一到旧影协，反革命变天账《中国电影发展史》的主编就把校样送给他看，恭恭敬敬地向他请教。这个大右派肉麻地吹捧说：“写得好，很有教育意义，如果早出几年，我就不会犯那样大的错误了。”不久，他被安插到《电影剧作》编辑部。袁文殊亲自指示说：“这个人在业务上有经验，可以帮助出出主意。”钟惦棐也果然不负期望，他一到《电影剧作》就大叫：办刊物“应当冒险”，说周扬曾经对他说过：“这样搞对了，就可以立大功”。什么“冒险”，什么“立大功”，一句话，就是要“冒”反革命之“险”，为中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义“立大功”！
    钟惦棐过去曾狂妄宣称：他要搞一本《电影美学》。搞《电影美学》干什么呢？钟惦棐供称：“我的《电影的锣鼓》还只不过是对《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》修正的开始。我的更有计划的反党活动还在后边，这就是我曾经计划写作的《电影美学》。”周扬、袁文殊一伙把钟惦棐弄到旧影协来，正是打算让他搞《电影美学》，以实现他们的反党夙愿！
    周扬一伙给钟惦棐摘掉右派帽子后，还曾打算提拔他担任《电影艺术》编辑部副主任，并准备把他重新拉入党内来。但是，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，打破了他们的黄粱美梦！
    十多年来，周扬一伙正是这样采取种种办法，通过各种途径，网罗了一大批象钟惦棐那样的牛鬼蛇神，从组织上为复辟资本主义创造条件。
    组织路线是为政治路线服务的。阶级斗争的事实表明：十几年来，反革命修正主义文艺黑线之所以能够在文艺界通行无阻，十分重要的原因，就是中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人周扬之流，推行了一条招降纳叛，结党营私，安插亲信，包庇坏人的反革命修正主义组织路线，从而组成了“一个暗藏在革命阵营的反革命派别，一个地下的独立王国”，控制了文艺界各部门的大权，专了我们无产阶级的政！
    我们要彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命复辟的阴谋，就一定要彻底砸烂这条反革命组织路线，继续向一切已经暴露出来和尚未暴露出来的阶级敌人猛烈开火。彻底清理文艺队伍，为建立一支真正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级革命文艺队伍而奋斗！
