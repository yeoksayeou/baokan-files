Chairman Mao, your soldiers around you are infinitely loyal to you!

Warmly celebrate the great leader Chairman Mao's reception of representatives from the Beijing Garrison, units carrying out "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks in Beijing, and soldiers from the 8341 Unit.

The East is red, the sun is rising! The magnificent Great Hall of the People is radiant with golden light, shining brilliantly.

Our most beloved great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and vigorous spirit, strides forward with a firm step. Along with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao and other central leaders, he came to the soldiers, warmly receiving the representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison, units carrying out "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks in Beijing, and soldiers from the 8341 Unit, who have made great achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

"Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Our great leader Chairman Mao warmly waved to the soldiers. The soldiers, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," enthusiastically cheered. The entire Great Hall of the People became a surging sea of red. How many soldiers shed tears of joy! How many soldiers opened the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and recorded this most unforgettable moment of happiness on the cover: February 19, 1968.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your health is excellent, and your energy is boundless. This is our greatest happiness! This is the greatest happiness for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and all revolutionary people around the world!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the midst of the triumphant march towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we are honored to receive your reception. This is your greatest care, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest spur for us!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The hearts of the soldiers around you are always with you. No matter how many words we say, we cannot express our infinite love for you; no matter how many songs we sing, we cannot praise your infinite admiration; even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our infinite faith in you will never change; even if the earth shakes and the mountains crumble, our infinite loyalty to you will never waver!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we love you infinitely!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The towering mountains reach the sky, and the vast sea has no bottom, but compared to the soldiers' love for you, the sea is shallow, and the mountains are low.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The soldiers of a certain company guarding Tiananmen Square once expressed their infinite love and loyalty to you with these lines: "What is the brightest in the world? The red sun on Tiananmen Square is the brightest! What is the reddest in the world? The heart that loves Chairman Mao is the reddest! What is the happiest in the world? Fighting by Chairman Mao's side is the happiest! What is the most glorious in the world? Defending Chairman Mao with one's life is the most glorious!" Today, the representative of this company, seeing you, is particularly excited. Dear Chairman Mao! Standing at Tiananmen Square, our hearts are with the red sun. Every moment we feel the deep affection of the Chinese people and the people of the world for you. Whether in wind and rain, guarding the post, thinking of you, our hearts are clear and our eyes are bright; whether in severe cold or scorching heat, patrolling Tiananmen Square, thinking of you, our fighting spirit is high; no matter how arduous the task, thinking of you, we are filled with boundless strength!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The soldiers of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" units fighting by your side, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, timely heard your great battle call and timely received the direct leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by you. They deeply felt your wisdom and greatness. The national "leftist" work flag—soldiers from the 8341 Unit stationed in Beijing Textile Factory—today, seeing you, excitedly said: Dear Chairman Mao! It is you who proposed and formulated the theory, line, policy, method, and policy of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history, prevented capitalist restoration, ensured that the socialist mountains will never change color, and opened the path to communism. You are the helmsman of the Chinese revolution and the hope of the world revolution. We are your soldiers by your side, forever loving you, forever loyal to you!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are our great savior. It is you who led us to liberation, and it is you who led us to smash the evil plot of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who wanted to push us back into the bitter sea. The guard soldier Yao Yujie, who received your reception, under the nurturing of your brilliant thoughts, grew from a beggar in the old society into a communist warrior like Wang Jie, who sacrifices himself to save comrades. When he lost his right hand to protect his comrades, he firmly said: "One hand can still follow Chairman Mao to revolution!" Today, Yao Yujie, seeing you, how can he not be moved to tears and deeply excited: Dear Chairman Mao! Your kindness to us is beyond the vast sky; our love for you is beyond the five lakes and four seas! With deep class feelings, he wrote with his left hand on the cover of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" the common wish of the soldiers: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The longer we follow you, the deeper our love for you. The Red First Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison was born in 1928 in the first revolutionary base area opened by you—Jinggangshan, participated in the victorious anti-"encirclement" battles under your personal command, embarked on the victorious Long March, and guarded the historic and significant Zunyi Conference. From Jinggangshan to Zunyi, from Yan'an to Beijing, this heroic Red Army company has long followed you, guarding by your side. Today, the young soldier Zhou Mingli of the Red First Company, seeing you, has a thousand words in his heart: Dear Chairman Mao! With you, the revolution advances and wins. We will definitely inherit the glorious tradition of the revolutionary forerunners, forever follow you, and love you infinitely!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we will defend you with our lives!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! "Whoever supports you, we support; whoever opposes you, we fight!" This is the clearest class stance of the guard soldiers by your side. "Live to fight for you, die to defend you!" This is the most resolute battle oath of the guard soldiers by your side.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The broad masses of soldiers in the Beijing Garrison are your most loyal guard soldiers. We bear the trust of the Chinese people and the people of the world, guarding by your side day and night, enduring the stars and moon on the post, braving the wind and snow patrolling the streets and alleys of the capital. With a heart of loyalty, we have built an iron wall to defend you. The First Company of a certain unit born in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an has been guarding by your side for 26 years. The first political instructor of this company, Du Zezhou, and the young soldier Wang Weimin, today, together seeing you, are surging with emotion, boiling with blood, and with an iron will, present their red hearts to you: Dear Chairman Mao! The soldiers by your side will defend you with their lives! Whoever opposes you, we will overthrow them; whoever dares to point the spearhead at the proletarian headquarters headed by you, we will smash them to pieces with our iron fists!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." Beijing is where you live, the heart of our great motherland, the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the center of the world revolution. Here, the likes of Chinese Khrushchev and all ghosts and snakes are not allowed to stir up trouble. The representative of the Fifth Company of a certain unit guarding the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Shi Tieliang, today, receiving your reception, shouted over and over again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" Dear Chairman Mao! We must firmly remember your great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, respect and support the revolutionary committee, defend the proletarian regime with blood and life, and let the iron mountains of the proletariat remain unchanged for thousands of years!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Defending your proletarian revolutionary line with our lives and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by you is the highest duty of the soldiers by your side. When you received the cultural revolution army eight times, they did not leave the battlefield for a moment, fearing neither the heat of summer nor the cold of winter, working day and night, forgetting sleep and food. The platoon leader Liu Daluan, who rescued the Red Guards and was awarded the Third-Class Merit, and the hero soldier Jia Qihui in the style of Liu Yingjun, seeing you, excitedly said: Dear Chairman Mao! It is your brilliant thoughts that gave us boundless strength. To defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by you, to defend your proletarian revolutionary line, we must be like the heroes of the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong: "Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the First Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison, who raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, seeing you, sincerely wished you eternal life! Eternal life! This company took revolutionary criticism as the battlefield to defend your brilliant thoughts. All the soldiers in the company held guns in one hand and pens in the other, using your brilliant thoughts as weapons, deeply exposing and thoroughly criticizing the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, letting your brilliant thoughts take root in the hearts of every soldier. Dear Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts are the banner of the times, the lighthouse of mankind, and the hope of the world. We will defend your brilliant thoughts forever, let your brilliant red flag fly high in all of China and the world! Forever fly high!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we will follow you step by step!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We are closest to you and must follow you the closest! The broad masses of soldiers of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" units fighting by your side, with the joy of victory, report to you: Holding high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, enthusiastically responding to your great call to "support the broad leftist masses," over the past year, we have worked with the highest enthusiasm, the fastest speed, and the greatest effort, propagandizing your brilliant thoughts, implementing your latest instructions, and achieving abundant results. The spring breeze of your brilliant thoughts has blown over all of Beijing, the revolutionary people have never been as united as they are now, the dictatorship of the proletariat has never been as consolidated as it is now, and the revolutionary situation has never been as good as it is now. The city and countryside of Beijing are all red, and the revolutionary committees of the municipal and 18 district/county revolutionary committees have all been established. This is all the great victory of your brilliant thoughts, all the great victory of implementing your latest instructions!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The soldiers of the 8341 Unit carrying out "leftist" tasks in the Beijing Textile Factory, looking up at the red sun with infinite affection, are extremely excited: Dear Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts, your latest instructions, are the soul of "leftist" work and the lighthouse of progress. Under the guidance of your brilliant thoughts, we seriously implement the principle of "supporting the left, not supporting the faction," the revolutionary workers have strengthened their proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, deeply carried out revolutionary great criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire factory has become an embodiment of your revolutionary line and strategic deployment. Dear Chairman Mao! All glory belongs to you, all victories belong to you. We swear to you: We will definitely engrave your latest instructions in our minds and implement them in our actions, remembering them for every second and not wavering for even a moment.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You instructed us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." We, on the front lines of "Three Supports, Two Militaries," helped the revolutionary masses of the capital to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Over 2.5 million revolutionary masses and cadres participated in the study, making your latest instructions bloom and bear fruit everywhere. The support personnel of the General Staff Department stationed in the Beijing Hotel system, who made outstanding achievements in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply felt: Dear Chairman Mao! Listening to your words is victory, holding study classes is solving problems! We must carry forward the revolutionary study style you have always advocated, actively learn and apply your brilliant thoughts, focus on the "implementation" of your latest instructions, and ensure that your latest instructions are fully implemented!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You called on us: "To grasp the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness." Today, the representatives of soldiers fighting on the support industry and agriculture front lines brought the good news of revolutionary and production victories. The representative of soldiers from a certain engineering unit of the Beijing Army supporting the Jingxi Coal Mine, the representative of soldiers from the direct subordinate units of the Navy supporting the Beijing Machine Tool Factory, have so many heartfelt words to tell you: Wherever your latest instructions shine, there is a revolutionary storm, and production is booming; the full implementation of your latest instructions is the full victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You instructed us: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." The soldiers of a certain unit of the Railway Engineering Corps carrying out military and political training tasks in Shijingshan Middle School, the soldiers of a certain unit of the Air Force carrying out military and political training tasks in Caochangdi Middle School, in this happy moment of receiving your reception, how can they forget your affectionate teachings. It is precisely your great instructions that have mobilized the revolutionary teachers and students extensively, daring to explore and take a gratifying step in creating a new educational system of the proletariat. We will definitely follow you, holding high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, doing a good job in the proletarian educational revolution, and being "revolutionary cadres who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we will be forever loyal to you!

What a happy, joyful, surging, and unforgettable night it is! The soldiers who received the warm reception of the great leader Chairman Mao, with hearts full of excitement, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" a thousand times, a million times, sang "The East is Red," "The Great Sea Navigates by the Helmsman," and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" a thousand times, a million times! A thousand hearts beat fiercely, a thousand oaths expressed a common resolve: Dear Chairman Mao! The soldiers by your side will be forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Being infinitely loyal to you means "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, fully implementing your latest instructions. The old Red Army soldier Guo Yuanxing, who has followed you for over 30 years in battles north and south, on September 8, 1944, at the memorial meeting for Zhang Zedong in Yan'an, personally heard you deliver the speech "In Memory of Comrade Zhang Zedong," which has great historical significance. For decades, the five shining characters of "Serving the People" have nurtured him, inspired him to fight, and guided him forward. Today, he said with great excitement: Dear Chairman Mao! Every bit of our progress, every bit of our achievement, is the victory of your brilliant thought of "Serving the People"! We will be forever loyal to you, serving the people wholeheartedly for life.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Being infinitely loyal to you means constantly fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, thoroughly transforming our worldview, and achieving ideological revolutionization. The representative of the advanced collective of studying Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Army, Sun Chenliang of the 4883 Unit Party Committee Study Group, the active member of studying Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Army, Wang Ziying, today, seeing you, felt infinite happiness, boundless warmth, and supreme glory. They excitedly expressed: Dear Chairman Mao! We are your most loyal guard soldiers. We will forever hold high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, forever highlight proletarian politics, insist on the four firsts, carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, launch the movement to create four good companies, and stride forward on the road of extremely proletarianization and extremely militarization!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Being infinitely loyal to you means, in the great storms of class struggle, unshakably standing on the side of your revolutionary line. The representative of the People's Armed Department, Zhang Zhuchen, who is praised as a red flag of "leftist" work, and the representative of the 4697 Unit, Yang Shuanzheng, fighting side by side, today, coming to your side, brought the battle oath of all soldiers: Definitely, in the great storms of class struggle, tempering an infinitely loyal red heart to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the political instructor of a certain company in the Beijing Garrison, Kong Xiangxiu, firmly remembers your teaching of "being both an 'official' and a common person," always appearing in the posture of an ordinary soldier, and always maintaining the fine style of hard work and plain living. Seeing you, he firmly said: Dear Chairman Mao! The sky changes, the earth changes, the mountains change, the rivers change, but the red heart of your soldiers, loyal to you, loyal to your brilliant thoughts, loyal to your revolutionary line, will never change!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The great sea navigates by the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We must take your close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, forever actively learn and apply your brilliant thoughts, love you infinitely, defend you with our lives, follow you step by step, and be forever loyal to you. We must respond to Vice Chairman Lin's battle call to "hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," in the new year, with full vigor, strive for the forefront, be modest and prudent, and work harder, strengthen military-civilian unity, fully implement your latest instructions, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

    毛主席啊，毛主席！战斗在您身边的“三支”“两军”指战员，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，及时听到您的伟大战斗号令，及时得到以您为首的无产阶级司令部的直接领导，最深刻地感受到您的英明和伟大。全国支左工作的一面红旗——八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员，今天见到了您，激动地说：敬爱的毛主席！是您提出和制定了在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，亲自发动和领导了人类历史上空前未有的无产阶级文化大革命运动，防止了资本主义复辟，保证了社会主义江山永不变色，开辟了通向共产主义的航道。您是中国革命的舵手，世界革命的希望。我们是您身边的战士，永远热爱您，永远忠于您！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们的大救星。是您领导我们翻身得解放，是您领导我们粉碎了党内一小撮走资派妄想把我们重新推进苦海的罪恶阴谋。受您接见的警卫战士姚玉琪，在您的光辉思想哺育下，由一个旧社会讨饭的苦孩子成长为一个舍身救战友的王杰式的共产主义战士。他为掩护战友而失去右手的时候，坚毅地说：“一只手照样跟着毛主席干革命！”今天，姚玉琪见到了您，怎能不热泪滚滚，激动万分：敬爱的毛主席！您对我们的恩情，万里长空容不下；我们对您的热爱，五湖四海也难装！他怀着深厚的阶级感情，用左手在《毛主席语录》扉页上，写下了广大战士的共同心愿：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！跟随您走过的光辉历程越长，对您的热爱就越深。北京卫戍区某部红一连，一九二八年在您亲手开辟的第一个革命根据地——井冈山诞生，在您亲自指挥下，参加了反“围剿”的胜利战斗，踏上了万里长征的胜利途程，保卫了具有伟大历史意义的遵义会议。从井冈山到遵义，从延安到北京，这个英雄的红军连队，长期跟着您，警卫在您的身边。今天，红一连的青年战士周明理看到您老人家，千言万语涌心头：敬爱的毛主席！有了您，革命就前进，就胜利。我们一定继承革命前辈的光荣传统，永远紧跟您，无限热爱您！

    毛主席啊，毛主席！您教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”北京是您居住的地方，是伟大祖国的心脏，是无产阶级文化大革命的策源地，是世界革命的中心，这里绝不容许中国赫鲁晓夫之流和一切牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪。在北京市革命委员会担任警卫任务的某部五连代表史铁良，今天受到您的接见，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”敬爱的毛主席！我们一定要牢记您“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，尊重和支持革命委员会，用鲜血和生命保卫无产阶级政权，让无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！誓死保卫您的无产阶级革命路线，誓死保卫您亲自发动起来的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是您身边战士的最崇高的职责。在您老人家八次接见文化革命大军的时候，他们一时一刻不离战斗岗位，炎夏不怕热，天寒不觉冷，日夜苦战，废寝忘食。奋不顾身抢救红卫兵荣立三等功的某部排长刘大乱和刘英俊式的英雄战士贾岐会，看到您老人家，他们激动地说：敬爱的毛主席！是您的光辉思想给了我们无穷的力量，为了保卫您亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，为了保卫您的无产阶级革命路线，我们要象英雄四排和李文忠那样：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举革命批判旗帜的北京卫戍区某部一连的代表崔明则，见到了您，最最衷心地祝愿您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！这个连把革命大批判当做保卫您的光辉思想的战场。全连指战员一手握枪，一手拿笔，以您的光辉思想为武器，深刻揭露、彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的滔天罪行，让您的光辉思想在每个指战员的心里牢牢扎根。敬爱的毛主席！您的光辉思想是时代的旗帜，人类的灯塔，世界的希望。我们要永生永世保卫您的光辉思想，让您的光辉思想的伟大红旗在全中国、全世界高高飘扬！永远飘扬！

    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们离您最近，要跟您最紧！战斗在您身边的“三支”“两军”部队广大指战员，怀着胜利的喜悦，向您汇报：高举您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，热烈响应您的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，一年来我们以最高的热情，最快的速度，最大的干劲，宣传您的光辉思想，落实您的最新指示，取得了丰硕成果。您的光辉思想的春风吹遍全北京，革命人民从来没有象现在这样团结，无产阶级专政从来没有象现在这样巩固，革命形势从来没有象现在这样大好。北京城乡一片红，市革命委员会和十八个区、县革命委员会全部建立起来了。这都是您的光辉思想的伟大胜利，都是落实您的最新指示的伟大胜利！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在北京针织总厂执行支左任务的八三四一部队指战员，怀着无限深情仰望着红太阳，心情万分激动：敬爱的毛主席！您的光辉思想，您的最新指示，是支左的灵魂，前进的灯塔。在您的光辉思想的照耀下，我们认真贯彻执行支左不支派的原则，革命职工增强了无产阶级党性，战胜了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，深入开展了革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改。全厂无产阶级文化大革命运动，成为体现您的革命路线和战略部署的典范。敬爱的毛主席！一切光荣归于您，一切胜利归于您，我们向您宣誓：我们一定把您的最新指示，铭刻在头脑里，落实在行动上，一分一秒都牢记，一丝一毫不动摇。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您指示我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”我们在“三支”“两军”第一线，帮助首都广大革命群众以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，二百五十多万名革命群众和革命干部参加了学习，使您的最新指示到处开花结果。在大办毛泽东思想学习班中做出突出成绩的总参谋部驻北京饭店系统支左人员，深有体会地说：敬爱的毛主席！听您的话就是胜利，办学习班就是解决问题！我们一定要发扬您一贯倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，活学活用您的光辉思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，保证您的最新指示条条落实，全面落实！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您号召我们：“要抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”。今天，奋战在支工、支农战线上的指战员代表，带来了革命和生产双胜利的喜讯。在京西木城涧煤矿支左的北京部队工程兵某部指战员的代表，在北京市机床工具总厂支左的海军直属机关指战员的代表，有多少贴心的话儿要对您讲：您的最新指示的光辉照到那里，那里就革命轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上；您的最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您指示我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”在石景山中学执行军政训练任务的铁道兵某部指战员，在草场地中学执行军政训练任务的空军某部指战员，在受您接见的幸福时刻，怎能忘记您的亲切教导。正是您的伟大指示，把革命师生广泛发动起来，为创建无产阶级的新型教育制度，进行了大胆探索，迈出了可喜的一步。我们一定紧跟您，高举您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，搞好无产阶级教育革命，做“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”。
    毛主席啊，毛主席，我们永远忠于您！
    这是多么幸福、多么欢乐、多么沸腾、多么难忘的夜晚啊！受到伟大领袖毛主席亲切接见的指战员们，怀着无比激动的心情，千遍万遍地欢呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”千遍万遍地高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》！千万颗红心激烈地跳动，千万个誓言表达出一个共同的决心：敬爱的毛主席！您身边的战士永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！无限忠于您，就要“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，全面落实您的最新指示。三十多年来跟着您南征北战的老红军战士古远兴，一九四四年九月八日在延安追悼张思德同志的大会上，亲自听到您作了《为人民服务》这篇具有伟大历史意义的讲演。几十年来，“为人民服务”这五个闪耀着共产主义思想光辉的大字，哺育他成长，鼓舞他战斗，指引他前进。今天他无比激动地说：敬爱的毛主席！我们的每一个进步，每一点成绩，都是您的“为人民服务”的光辉思想的胜利！我们永远忠于您，就要一辈子全心全意为人民服务。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！无限忠于您，就要不断斗私批修，彻底改造世界观，实现思想革命化。北京部队学习毛主席著作先进集体、四八八三部队党委学习毛主席著作中心组的代表孙臣良，北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子王子英，今天见到了您老人家，感到无限幸福，无比温暖，无尚光荣。他们激动地表示：敬爱的毛主席！我们是您最忠诚的警卫战士，我们要永远高举您光辉思想的伟大红旗，永远突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，开展创造四好连队运动，在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的大道上阔步前进！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！无限忠于您，就要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，毫不动摇地站在您的革命路线一边。被誉为人民武装部支左的一面红旗的平谷县武装部代表张仲臣和并肩战斗的四六九七部队代表杨拴成，今天来到您的身边，带来了全体指战员的战斗誓言：一定要在阶级斗争的大风浪里，经风雨，见世面，锤炼出无限忠于毛主席的红心。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！北京市革命委员会委员、北京卫戍区某连指导员孔祥秀，牢记您的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，处处以普通一兵的姿态出现，时刻保持着艰苦奋斗的优良作风。他见到您，坚定地说：敬爱的毛主席！天变地变，山变河变，您的战士忠于您、忠于您的光辉思想、忠于您的革命路线的一颗红心永不变！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们一定要以您的亲密战友林副主席为光辉榜样，永远活学活用您的光辉思想，无限热爱您，誓死保卫您，步步紧跟您，永远忠于您。我们一定要响应林副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的战斗号召，在新的一年里，鼓足干劲，力争上游，谦虚谨慎，再接再厉，加强军民团结，全面落实您的最新指示，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
