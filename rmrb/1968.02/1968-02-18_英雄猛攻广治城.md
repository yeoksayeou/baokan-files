The People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam received orders to immediately lead their entire unit to the command post. On this day, the command post was exceptionally solemn. The platoon leader warmly shook hands with everyone and said with confidence, "Comrades, the attack on Broad City is about to begin. The platoon has assigned your combat unit the task of blowing up the city gate, then coordinating with brother units to destroy the enemy's warehouses, annihilate the enemy's artillery positions, and open the prison gates to rescue our fellow villagers imprisoned by the enemy."

The soldiers listened intently as the platoon leader issued orders, their eyes gleaming with excitement. They then began the intense preparations. Commander Ah Qian opened the map and repeatedly studied the battlefield terrain and positions; others packed explosive packages, prepared rocket launchers, and cleaned their guns. They decided to eliminate the enemy's firepower as soon as the battle began, paving the way for the successful completion of the mission assigned by their superiors.

After the order to advance was given, the troops quickly moved towards Broad City.

At midnight, the troops entered their positions. Ah Qian and all the unit members anxiously awaited the attack order, their hearts burning with hatred for the enemy.

The attack began. The artillery of the People's Liberation Armed Forces accurately hit their targets, and the entire city of Broad trembled under the thunderous roar of the artillery.

Ah Qian led his unit towards the pitch-black city gate. The enemy's two heavy machine guns spat long tongues of fire, attempting to block the heroes' advance. Soldier Ah An quickly set up the machine gun, firing bursts of bullets at the enemy. However, the stubborn enemy continued to fire, so soldier Ah Zu immediately used a rocket launcher to eliminate the enemy's firepower. Ah Qian, Ah Shi, and Ah Le took the opportunity to quickly advance towards the city gate. Ah An's machine gun fiercely fired at the bunkers and watchtowers, covering the assault team as they rushed forward.

The assault team's soldiers hung explosive packages on the city gate. With a loud explosion, the two gates were blown to pieces, and the assault troops rushed into the city, their battle cries striking fear into the enemy, causing them to flee in disarray.

The mission to blow up the city gate was successfully completed. Ah Qian led his entire unit, along with the assault team, into the city to encircle and annihilate the enemy, destroying the enemy's artillery positions, parking lots, and ammunition depots.

Broad City was engulfed in the flames of revenge by the People's Liberation Armed Forces. Ah Qian led his unit forward, eliminating the enemy guarding the prison, opening the prison gates, and rescuing hundreds of oppressed fellow villagers, allowing them to return to their liberated homeland.

The flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fluttered in the clear sky. Ah Qian and his unit members climbed to the top of Broad City, gazing into the distance. In the night, they saw Broad City burning, and the entire South was ablaze. The night was about to pass, and dawn was about to break.

    英雄猛攻广治城
    越南南方人民解放武装力量某部战斗组组长阿谦接到上级命令，立即带领全组同志赶往指挥所。这一天，指挥所显得格外庄严。分队长亲切地跟大家握了握手，满怀信心地说：“同志们，对广治市的进攻就要开始了。分队交给你们战斗组的任务是炸毁城门，然后配合兄弟部队破坏敌人的仓库、摧毁敌人的炮兵阵地，打开牢门救出被敌人监禁的乡亲。”
    战士们聚精会神地听着分队长下达命令，眼睛闪烁着激动的目光。接着他们就投入了紧张的准备工作。组长阿谦打开地图，反复研究了战斗地形和位置；其他同志有的捆炸药包，有的准备火箭筒，有的擦枪。他们决定要在战斗一打响就把敌人的火力点消灭掉，为胜利完成上级交给的战斗任务开辟道路。
    出发命令下达后，部队便迅速地向广治市进发。
    午夜时分，部队进入阵地。阿谦和全组同志们焦急地等待着攻击命令，每个人的心中都燃烧着对敌人仇恨的烈火。
    进攻开始了，人民解放武装力量的炮火准确地命中目标，整个广治城在人民解放武装力量的隆隆炮声中震动。
    阿谦率领全组同志冲向漆黑的城门。敌人的两挺重机枪吐着长长的火舌，妄想阻挡英雄们前进。战士阿安迅速地架起机枪，一串串猛烈的子弹射向敌人。但是顽抗的敌人继续射击，于是战士阿祖立即用一个火箭筒消灭了敌人的火力点。阿谦、阿时和阿寞等乘机迅速向城门逼进。阿安的机枪猛烈地向碉堡和岗楼射击，掩护爆破小组冲上去。
    爆破小组的战士把炸药包挂在城门上，只听一声巨响，两扇城门顿时被炸毁，突击队员们飞也似地冲进了城门，一阵阵喊杀声吓得敌人胆战心寒，狼狈逃窜。
    炸毁城门的任务胜利完成，阿谦率领全组战士跟突击队一起冲进城内围歼伪军，摧毁敌人的炮兵阵地、停车场和弹药库。
    广治市淹没在人民解放武装力量复仇的熊熊烈火中。阿谦率领全组同志继续前进，消灭了守卫监狱的敌人，打开牢门，救出了数百名受迫害的乡亲，使他们返回获得了解放的家乡。
    越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜在晴空中飘扬。阿谦和小组的同志们登上广治城楼，遥望四方，黑夜中只看见广治城在燃烧，整个南方在燃烧。黑夜即将过去，曙光即将来临。
