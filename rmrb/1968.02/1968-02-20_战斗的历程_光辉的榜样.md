The heroic people and soldiers of South Vietnam, since the New Year, have launched two consecutive powerful offensives against the American puppet forces, striking all over the vast battlefield of South Vietnam, fighting bravely, and striking fear into the hearts of the enemy, making them wail in despair. The resounding victory of the South Vietnamese people and soldiers has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and has thoroughly crushed the arrogance of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries!

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, pointed out: "You have fought well! Under extremely difficult conditions, relying on your own strength, you have defeated the most ferocious imperialist power, the United States, making it desperate and disgraced. This is a great victory." "Your victory once again shows that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

The glorious course of armed struggle and brilliant victories of the South Vietnamese people and soldiers have once again forcefully proven a timeless truth: to use revolutionary armed forces to oppose reactionary armed forces, and to use revolutionary war to oppose reactionary war, is the only correct path for oppressed nations and peoples to strive for liberation.

Years ago, the American imperialist invaders crossed the ocean to invade South Vietnam, commanding tens of thousands of puppet troops they had assembled, burning, killing, and looting, in an attempt to extinguish the flames of struggle by the South Vietnamese people against the brutal rule of the American-Brutus clique and for liberation. At that time, the enemy's arrogance was so great, and they boasted so much! It seemed that the wheel of history could be manipulated at will by them. But what about the people of South Vietnam? They were almost unarmed. Did they dare to confront this ferocious giant? Did they have the courage to persist in the struggle and achieve victory? The heroic people of South Vietnam firmly believed in the justice of their struggle, saw through the weak essence of the American paper tiger, and resolutely took up arms to fight. After several years of struggle, they finally achieved today's great situation.

Years ago, facing the American invaders with their various modern weapons, could the people of South Vietnam organize a force capable of confronting the enemy? The people of South Vietnam responded loudly: Yes! With deep hatred for the American imperialists and their running dogs, the people of South Vietnam rose up, overcame numerous difficulties, and waged a fierce and unyielding struggle in the green mountains and waters of South Vietnam. They seized weapons from the enemy to arm themselves and, seven years ago on February 15, unified the scattered people's armed units into an invincible people's liberation armed force, pushing the South Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle to a new stage.

"A single spark can start a prairie fire." From small to large, from weak to strong, this is the law of the growth and strengthening of the armed forces of the revolutionary people. The people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam were initially only some scattered guerrilla units with rudimentary weapons. However, relying on the broad revolutionary people, they creatively applied the strategies and tactics of people's war, building iron walls and barriers of anti-American national salvation across the vast lands of South Vietnam, and establishing a powerful people's liberation armed force. They defeated more than a million American invaders, puppet troops, and mercenaries, leaving them in disarray and with no way out.

The course of battle of the people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam proves: as long as one relies on one's own strength to wage a true people's war, then, no matter how ferocious the enemy is, the revolutionary "weak" at the beginning will eventually defeat the reactionary "strong," and the "native" weapons in the hands of the revolutionaries will eventually defeat the "foreign" weapons in the hands of the reactionaries. This is the inevitable logic of people's armed struggle. The people and soldiers of South Vietnam, relying on their fearless revolutionary spirit, learned war in war, gained rich experience in struggle, and mastered the hard skills of killing the enemy. Step by step, they put the enemy at a disadvantage, making the American invaders like a stupid pig stuck in the mud, about to be engulfed.

Heroic comrades in South Vietnam, your glorious course of battle has set a shining example for the revolutionary people of the world, writing a brilliant new chapter in the history of people's war, and creating a model of relying on one's own strength to resist and defeat American imperialist aggression since the end of World War II. This proves to the world that the American imperialist paper tiger, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, can indeed be defeated.

Comrades in South Vietnam, we learn from you, we salute you, and we pledge to be your strong rear guard, firmly supporting you to fight to the end until you achieve a complete victory in the anti-American national salvation war. No enemy, no difficulty, can stop the victorious advance of the Vietnamese comrades!

    战斗的历程　光辉的榜样
    解放军总后勤部机关无产阶级革命派
    英雄的越南南方军民，新春以来，连续两次向美伪军发动强大攻势，在广阔的南越战场上全面出击，英勇战斗，把敌人打得闻风胆丧，鬼哭狼嚎。越南南方军民的这一震动世界的辉煌胜利，大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝修反的威风！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在给越南南方民族解放阵线阮友寿主席的电报中指出：“你们打得好！你们在非常艰苦的条件下，依靠自己的力量，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，这是一个伟大的胜利。”“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    越南南方军民武装斗争的光辉历程和辉煌胜利，再一次雄辩地证明了一个颠扑不破的真理：用革命武装反对反革命武装，用革命战争反对反革命战争，是被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的唯一正确的途径。
    当年，美帝国主义侵略者远渡重洋，闯进南越，指挥着由它拼凑起来的数十万伪军，烧杀掳掠，妄图扑灭越南南方人民反对美吴集团血腥统治、争取解放的斗争烈火。那时节，敌人的气焰何等嚣张，牛皮吹得何等大呵！似乎历史的巨轮，是可以由他们随意拨弄的。而南越人民呢，几乎是赤手空拳。敢不敢迎击这个穷凶极恶的庞然大物，有没有勇气坚持斗争，夺取胜利？英雄的南越人民，坚信自己的斗争是正义的，看透了美帝这只外强中干的纸老虎的虚弱本质，毅然拿起武器，坚持战斗，经过几年的斗争，终于打出了今天这样一片大好形势。
    当年，面对着拥有各种现代化武器的美国侵略者，南越人民能不能够组织起一支足以与敌人较量的力量？南越人民响亮地回答：能！南越人民怀着对美帝及其走狗的刻骨仇恨，揭竿而起，克服重重困难，在南越的苍山绿水间进行了艰苦卓绝的战斗。他们从敌人手里夺取武器装备自己，并且在七年前的二月十五日，把分散在各地的人民武装单位，统一成为一支不可战胜的人民解放武装力量，把南越人民的抗美救国斗争推进到一个新阶段。
    “星星之火，可以燎原。”从小到大，从弱到强，这是革命人民武装成长壮大的规律。越南南方人民解放武装力量，起初只不过是一些仅有简陋武器的分散的游击队。但是，他们依靠广大的革命人民，创造性地运用人民战争的战略战术，在南越广阔的土地上筑起了一道道抗美救国的铜墙铁壁，建立了一支强大的人民解放武装力量，把一百多万美国侵略军、伪军和仆从军打得落花流水，走投无路。
    越南南方人民解放武装力量的战斗历程证明：只要依靠自己的力量，打一场真正的人民战争，那么，无论敌人怎样凶狠，开始时的革命的“弱”者，最后必将战胜反革命的“强”者，革命者手中的“土”武器，最后必将战胜反革命手中的“洋”武器。这是人民武装斗争的必然逻辑。越南南方军民依靠大无畏的革命精神，在战争中学会战争，取得了丰富的斗争经验，掌握了过硬的杀敌本领，一步步地把敌人置于劣势，使美国侵略者象一只掉在泥潭里的蠢猪，眼看就要灭顶。
    英雄的越南南方战友们，你们光辉的战斗历程，为世界革命人民树立了一个敢于斗争、敢于胜利的光辉榜样，在人民战争史上写下了光芒万丈的新篇章，创造了第二次世界大战以后依靠自己的力量抗击和战胜美帝国主义侵略的典范。这就向全世界证明，美帝国主义这只外强中干的纸老虎是完全能够被打败的。
    越南南方的战友们，我们向你们学习，我们向你们致敬，我们誓作你们的坚强后盾，坚决支持你们打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的彻底胜利。任何敌人，任何困难，都阻挡不了越南战友的胜利前进！
