In 1961, Zhou Yang, in a meeting, spoke in a soft and charming voice: "Our 'artistic troops are a lovely troop,' 'a lovely and good troop.'" He praised them left and right, with words of admiration never ending. Why are they 'lovely'? According to Zhou Yang, because the 'core' and 'main force' of this troop are the 'working class.'

Who were the 'core' and 'main force' of the past artistic circle? Here, Zhou Yang hesitated and stammered, without directly saying it out. In fact, those with keen eyes could see that the so-called 'core' and 'main force' referred to Zhou Yang himself and his accomplices such as Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, Tian Han, Yang Han Sheng, and others. They occupied the party and government leadership positions in the artistic circle, self-proclaimed as 'ancestors' and 'old heads,' arrogant and unruly, naturally only they were the 'core' and 'main force' of this 'lovely troop.' However, a look at history shows that they had nothing to do with the 'working class.' Before liberation, these people, wearing the cloak of 'Communist Party members,' engaged in counter-revolutionary activities; after liberation, they followed China's Khrushchev, fiercely resisting Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. They were a bunch of Kuomintang spies, traitors of the Communist Party, a bunch of old counter-revolutionaries with heinous crimes!

The counter-revolutionary 'core' and 'main force' of the artistic circle, for a long time, connected up and down, recruited and absorbed a group of demons and monsters, forming a 'hidden counter-revolutionary faction within the revolutionary camp,' an underground independent kingdom. In the Chinese Opera Research Institute, Zhou Yang and his ilk also carefully cultivated a 'lovely troop.' In this 'lovely troop,' from old counter-revolutionaries who have been anti-party for decades, to those 'cultivated' by them after liberation, like Yevtushenko of the Soviet revisionists; from those wearing the label of 'progressive cultural figures,' who were Kuomintang majors, to those who exchanged a dog's life for an anti-communist announcement; from those who compiled black books and wrote black articles, to those who created anti-party scripts and drew black paintings, it was truly a complete set of all roles. When the 'edict' of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev was issued, these guys immediately responded, waving flags and shouting, pouncing on the proletariat. Zhou Yang said to 'open banned plays,' and this 'lovely troop' of his had a general named Zhang Geng rush out, shouting, "Release! Release! Release!" "To rehabilitate the plays that cannot be overturned," to summon the spirits of the corpses and ghosts that had been sent to the eighteenth layer of hell. Zhou Yang said to 'excavate traditions,' and this 'lovely troop' of his had a vanguard named Tao Junqi rush out. With the piety of writing to Chiang Kai-shek in the past, he knelt in front of the garbage bin of old Beijing opera, treating thousands of reactionary and decadent old plays as sacred objects, compiling a book of tens of thousands of words, 'An Initial Exploration of Beijing Opera Repertoires,' causing the opera stage to be filled with evil winds and ghosts flying everywhere. When Comrade Jiang Qing led the cultural revolution army to launch a fierce attack on the old Beijing opera, this fortress of the bourgeoisie, Zhou Yang's 'lovely troop' had a henchman, Lin Hanbiao, jump out, shooting the most vicious arrow at the proletarian headquarters—'Random Notes After Watching "The Capture of Tiger Mountain,"' attempting to fill the socialist stage with the ugly images of bandits and hooligans... This troop was so 'handy,' in the eyes of Zhou Yang and his ilk, how could they not feel 'good' and 'lovely'?

Chairman Mao taught us: "There is no love without reason, and there is no hate without reason." Zhou Yang's insistence on dressing up his counter-revolutionary clique as a 'lovely troop' is certainly not without reason. Zhou Yang said: If one thinks that this is a 'completely black, bourgeois, and backward old intellectual troop,' 'the party leaders would inevitably regard themselves as reformers, always wanting to reform others,' and would produce 'rudeness' and 'persecution,' actually placing themselves in the position of the rulers of the old society. In short, the so-called 'rudeness,' 'reform,' 'persecution,' and so on, are actually the hostility and fear of the counter-revolutionary clique led by Zhou Yang towards the dictatorship of the proletariat. In order to hide for a long time in the revolutionary camp to restore capitalism in China, they need to disguise themselves. Thus, Zhou Yang opened the big red umbrella of 'the artistic troop is a lovely troop.'

History is ruthless. Under the sunlight of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Zhou Yang and his 'lovely troop' have all revealed their ugly true colors. For this small group of particularly good at disguising chameleons, we must be ruthless and unyielding, firmly grasp and struggle, and smash this counter-revolutionary commando unit thoroughly!

    把周扬“可爱的队伍”彻底打垮
    红旗兵
    一九六一年，周扬在一次座谈会上操着娓娓动听的腔调说：我们的“文艺队伍是可爱的队伍”，“是一支可爱的很好的队伍”。左一个“很好”，右一个“可爱”，赞叹之声，不绝于耳。为什么“可爱”呢？据周扬说，因为这支队伍的“核心”和“主力”“是工人阶级”。
    过去文艺界的“核心”和“主力”是谁呢？这里周扬扭扭捏捏，吞吞吐吐，没有直接说出来。其实，明眼人一看就知道，所谓“核心”和“主力”，指的就是周扬自己及其同伙夏衍、林默涵、田汉、阳翰笙等一批人。他们窃据了文艺界的党政领导大权，自封为“祖师爷”、“老头子”，飞扬跋扈，不可一世，自然只有他们才是这支“可爱的队伍”中的“核心”和“主力”了。然而，一查历史，他们却与“工人阶级”根本无缘。解放前，这些人身披“共产党员”的外衣，干着反革命的勾当；解放后，他们又紧跟中国的赫鲁晓夫，疯狂抵制毛主席的革命文艺路线，为资本主义复辟大造舆论。他们是一伙国民党特务，共产党的叛徒，是一伙罪行累累的老反革命！
    文艺界的这伙反革命的“核心”和“主力”，长期以来，上下串连，招降纳叛，网罗了一批牛鬼蛇神，形成了一个“暗藏在革命阵营的反革命派别”，一个地下的独立王国。在中国戏曲研究院，周扬之流也苦心经营了一支他们的“可爱的队伍”。在这支“可爱的队伍”里，从反党几十年的老反革命，到解放后他们“培养”起来的苏修叶甫图申科式的人物；从挂着“进步文化人”招牌的国民党少校，到以“反共启事”换取一条狗命的无耻叛徒；从编黑书、写黑文章的，到炮制反党剧本、画黑画的，真是生旦净末丑，样样俱全。当中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的“圣旨”一下，这帮家伙便立即应声而上，摇旗呐喊，向无产阶级猛扑过来。周扬说要“开放禁戏”，他们这支“可爱的队伍”里便冲出一员名叫张庚的干将，狂呼“放！放！放！”“要给翻不了身的戏平反”，为已被打入十八层地狱的僵尸厉鬼摇幡招魂。周扬说要“挖掘传统”，他们这支“可爱的队伍”里便杀出一个名叫陶君起的急先锋。他怀着当年上书蒋介石时的虔诚，跪拜在旧京剧的垃圾箱前，把数以千计的反动腐朽的旧剧目当作神物供奉起来，编出一部数十万言的《京剧剧目初探》，使戏曲舞台上妖风四起，幽魂横飞。当江青同志率领文艺革命大军，向旧京剧这个资产阶级的顽固堡垒发动猛烈进攻的时候，周扬这支“可爱的队伍”里，又有一个打手林涵表跳了出来，向无产阶级司令部射出了一支最恶毒的毒箭——《〈智取威虎山〉观后漫笔》，妄图让土匪流氓的丑恶形象充塞社会主义舞台……这支队伍是这样的“得心应手”，在周扬之流看来，怎么不感到“好”得很，“可爱”得很呢？！
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”周扬所以极力要把他这个反革命集团打扮成什么“可爱的队伍”，决不是没有原因的。周扬说：如果认为这是“漆黑一团的、资产阶级的、落后得很的旧知识分子队伍”，“党的领导者就必然以改造者自居，就天天想改造人家”，就会产生“粗暴”、“迫害”，“实际上就把自己放到旧社会统治者的地位上去”。戳穿了说，所谓“粗暴”、“改造”、“迫害”等等，其实正是以周扬为首的反革命集团对于无产阶级专政的敌视和恐惧。为了长久埋伏在革命阵营之中，以便在中国复辟资本主义，他们是十分需要伪装的。于是，周扬就打开了“文艺队伍是可爱的队伍”这把大红伞。
    历史是无情的。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的阳光下，周扬和他的“可爱的队伍”都现出了丑恶的原形。对于这一小撮特别善于伪装的变色虫，我们一定要毫不留情，毫不手软，狠揪狠斗，把这支反革命的别动队彻底打垮！
