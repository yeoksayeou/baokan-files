The military and civilians of South Vietnam's central region have fought shoulder to shoulder, annihilating American puppet forces in a powerful Tet Offensive. After seven days of fierce battle, they liberated vast rural areas, smashed the puppet government's institutions, established revolutionary governments, and liberated 170,000 people.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 21st, during the powerful Tet Offensive, hundreds of thousands of people in towns and rural areas across South Vietnam's central region rose up, joining the People's Liberation Armed Forces in a courageous fight, leaving the enemy in disarray.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, from January 31st to February 6th, over the course of seven days, the people of this region bravely took up arms, joining the People's Liberation Armed Forces in launching attacks on reactionary forces entrenched in various strongholds. They smashed the puppet government's institutions at the provincial, county, township, and village levels, seized power, and established revolutionary governments. With a surging revolutionary spirit, they destroyed the enemy's numerous "strategic hamlets," liberated vast rural areas, controlled six provincial capitals and twenty counties or towns, and liberated 75,000 people in various towns and over 100,000 people in rural areas.

While launching continuous attacks on the enemy's military and political headquarters in various towns, the people of various provinces in the central region swiftly cut off more than twenty of the enemy's important transportation lines, surrounded, isolated, and cleared out the enemy's remaining strongholds and outposts along these lines.

Between January 31st and February 5th, in the My Tho province, along the Fourth National Highway from the New Fragrance area to the My Thuong Ferry, more than 50,000 people in various "strategic hamlets" rose up, destroyed many "strategic hamlets," and punished many villains. With the assistance of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, the local people severely damaged the Fourth National Highway and heavily struck the enemy, annihilating 500 enemy troops, dissolving 2,500 puppet soldiers, forcing the enemy to withdraw from 43 strongholds and outposts, and controlling almost all the villages along the Fourth National Highway.

In just one night, the military and civilians of My Tho and Go Cong provinces cut off and controlled the Thirty-Fourth National Highway from My Tho to Go Cong. Additionally, the people of Ben Tre, Kien Phong, Kien Hung, and An Giang provinces also organized and cut off the enemy's transportation lines, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Currently, the urban and rural people of the central region are closely united, resolutely overcoming all difficulties, defending the revolutionary achievements they have gained, and bravely fighting for the complete victory of the anti-American, national salvation war.
