Revolutionary soldiers, filled with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards the great leader Chairman Mao, wave their red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!" The revolutionary soldiers declare: Our most beloved great commander Chairman Mao, we are determined to further implement your great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses, to strictly adhere to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, to do a better job in the "Three Supports and Two Military" tasks, and to achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan, on February 19, received representatives from the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army and the units executing the "Three Supports and Two Military" tasks in Beijing, as well as the officers and soldiers of the 8341 unit. Chairman Mao waved to the revolutionary soldiers from the rostrum of the Great Hall of the People.
