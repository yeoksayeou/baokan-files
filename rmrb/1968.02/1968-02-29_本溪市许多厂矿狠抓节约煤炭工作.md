Many factories and mines in Benxi City, Liaoning Province, have been vigorously promoting coal conservation. Revolutionary workers in these enterprises have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great calls to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "to further economize is to make revolution." They have started from promoting the ideological revolution of the people, and have made remarkable achievements in coal conservation.

Since last winter, with the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, many factories and mines in the city have begun to pay attention to coal conservation. In December last year and January this year, the city held two consecutive meetings to exchange experiences in coal conservation. Various industrial departments also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for boiler operators to promote coal conservation work. Many boiler operators said, "With Mao Zedong Thought in mind, the boiler will surely burn brightly." Many factories and mines have also promoted the use of smokeless coal produced by rural small coal mines, or coal gangue, water slag, and coal mud to burn boilers, changing the habit of using only bituminous coal, and finding a way to conserve good coal. The Benxi Steel Company's power plant launched a mass campaign for coal conservation. Workers discovered leaks in the equipment and went to plug the holes, preventing any loss of heat. Coal unloading workers were particularly careful when unloading coal cars, ensuring that no coal was scattered and wasted. They also improved the operation mode of the steam turbine generator. It is calculated that this measure alone can save more than sixty tons of coal per day. The revolutionary workers of the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Cement Factory fully utilized coal gangue and water slag, saving a large amount of good coal. The workers' bathhouse of the Caitun Coal Mine of the Benxi Mining Bureau, after improving the boiler, now uses two boilers to heat water, which is better than using three boilers in the past, saving a large amount of coal, and the majority of workers are very satisfied.

    本溪市许多厂矿狠抓节约煤炭工作
    据新华社沈阳二十八日电　辽宁省本溪市许多厂矿的革命职工，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召，从促进人的思想革命化入手，狠抓节约煤炭工作，取得了比较显著的成绩。
    去年入冬以来，在人民解放军驻军的帮助下，全市许多厂矿就开始注意节约煤炭。去年十二月和今年一月，全市连续召开了两次会议，交流了节约煤炭的经验。各工业部门也为司炉人员举办了毛泽东思想学习班，推动节约煤炭工作。许多司炉人员说：“心中有了毛泽东思想，锅炉一定烧得旺。”许多厂矿还推广了用农村小煤窑生产的无烟煤或煤矸石、水碴、煤泥烧锅炉的经验，改变了历来都用烟煤的习惯，为节约好煤找到了门路。本溪钢铁公司发电厂开展了群众性的节约煤炭活动。工人发现那里设备有漏气，就到那里去堵漏洞，不让一点热量损耗。卸煤工人在卸煤车时，格外小心，不让煤炭失散浪费。他们还改进了汽轮发电机的运行方式，据计算，仅这一项措施每天就可以节省煤炭六十多吨。工农兵水泥厂的广大革命职工充分利用煤矸石、水碴，节省了大量好煤。本溪矿务局采屯煤矿的职工浴池，经过改进锅炉，现在用两台锅炉烧水比过去用三台锅炉烧水效果还好，节约了大量煤炭，广大职工也非常满意。
