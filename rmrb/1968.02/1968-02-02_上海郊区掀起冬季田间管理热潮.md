The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs of Shanghai are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They regard doing a good job in winter production and ensuring a bumper harvest of summer crops this year as an important part of fully carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At present, many communes and production teams have launched a craze for field management centered on fertilizer accumulation, top dressing, and drought resistance to protect seedlings.

Since the beginning of winter, due to the prolonged low temperatures in the suburbs of Shanghai, winter production has encountered various difficulties. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants proudly declare that doing a good job in winter production and achieving a bumper agricultural harvest in 1968 is an important link in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Cold weather cannot dampen our resolve, and frozen ground cannot stop our enthusiasm. They follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" and establish the idea of conquering nature. Full of vigor and high morale, they persist in going to work in the bitter cold of minus five or six degrees to dredge mud and accumulate fertilizer, strengthening field management.

    上海郊区掀起冬季田间管理热潮
    上海郊区广大贫下中农和革命干部坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，把搞好冬季生产，夺取今年夏熟作物丰收，作为全面落实毛主席最新指示的重要组成部分。目前，不少社、队已掀起一个以积肥、追肥和抗旱保苗为中心的田间管理热潮。
    入冬以来，由于上海郊区长期低温，给冬季生产带来了种种困难。广大贫下中农豪迈地说，搞好冬季生产，夺取一九六八年农业大丰收，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要一环。天冷冷不倒我们的决心，地冻冻不住我们的干劲，他们遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，树立人定胜天的思想，意气风发，斗志昂扬，在零下五、六度的严寒天气，坚持出工罱泥积肥，加强田间管理。
