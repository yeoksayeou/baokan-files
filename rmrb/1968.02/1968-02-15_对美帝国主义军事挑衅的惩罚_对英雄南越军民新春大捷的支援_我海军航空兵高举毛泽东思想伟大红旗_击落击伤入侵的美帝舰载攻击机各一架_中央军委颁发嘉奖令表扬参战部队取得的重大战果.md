Our naval air force, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, shot down and damaged one U.S. imperialist carrier-based attack aircraft each.

The Central Military Commission issued an order of commendation praising the great achievements of the participating units.

New China News Agency, February 14th: In the midst of the great situation where our people are welcoming the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the heroic Vietnamese people and soldiers in the South have achieved a brilliant New Year victory, driving the U.S. imperialists into a state of disarray, the aggressors, unwilling to accept defeat, are desperately seeking a way out through escalating military adventurism and making more frantic death throes. This morning, they dispatched two U.S. Navy A-1H type carrier-based attack aircraft to invade the airspace over our Hainan Island, engaging in military provocations. Our heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army naval air force immediately retaliated, shooting down one aircraft and damaging another. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a major achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This victory is a punishment for the U.S. imperialists who have been continuously provoking our country militarily, and it is a support for the heroic Vietnamese people and soldiers in the South who have achieved a brilliant New Year victory.

New China News Agency, February 14th: The Central Military Commission issued an order of commendation, praising the unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army naval air force that shot down and damaged one U.S. Navy A-1H type carrier-based attack aircraft each this morning over the airspace of Hainan Island.

The order of commendation states: In the midst of the great situation where the entire country is welcoming the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have shot down and damaged one U.S. imperialist Navy A-1H type carrier-based attack aircraft each that invaded the airspace over our Hainan Island, thereby deserving special commendation.

The order of commendation states: This victory is a major achievement of your high举ing of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and your active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works. It is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This victory is a punishment for the U.S. imperialists who have been continuously provoking our country militarily, and it is a support for the heroic Vietnamese people and soldiers in the South who have achieved a brilliant New Year victory.

The order of commendation states: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last struggle." The U.S. imperialists, who are in an unprecedentedly serious predicament both domestically and internationally, will never give up. They will definitely continue to engage in war provocations and even launch new military adventurism. We must remain highly vigilant against this. I hope that you will hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, fully implement the series of latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, seriously summarize experiences, remain humble and vigilant, strengthen preparedness, and achieve new merits for the people in the great struggle to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and national defense.

    对美帝国主义军事挑衅的惩罚　对英雄南越军民新春大捷的支援
    我海军航空兵高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    击落击伤入侵的美帝舰载攻击机各一架
    中央军委颁发嘉奖令表扬参战部队取得的重大战果
    新华社十四日讯　在我国人民迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利，英雄的越南南方军民新春大捷，把美帝国主义打得狼狈不堪的大好形势下，美国侵略者不甘心于失败，妄图从扩大军事冒险中寻找出路，作更加疯狂的垂死挣扎。今天上午，派遣海军A—1H型舰载攻击机两架，侵入我海南岛上空进行军事挑衅，我英雄的中国人民解放军海军航空兵当即迎头痛击，一举击落一架，击伤一架。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的重大成果。这一胜利，是对向我国不断进行军事挑衅的美帝国主义的惩罚，是对英雄的越南南方军民无比辉煌的新春大捷的支援。
    新华社十四日讯　中央军委颁发嘉奖令，表扬今天上午在海南岛上空一举击落击伤美国海军Ａ—１Ｈ型舰载攻击机各一架的中国人民解放军海军航空兵某部。
    嘉奖令说，在全国迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，你们将侵入我海南岛上空进行军事挑衅的两架美帝国主义海军A—1H型舰载攻击机，一举击落击伤各一架，特予通令嘉奖。
    嘉奖令说，这次胜利，是你们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的重大成果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。这一胜利，是对向我国不断进行军事挑衅的美帝国主义的惩罚，是对于英雄的越南南方军民无比辉煌的新春大捷的支援。
    嘉奖令说，毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”在国内外陷入空前严重困境的美帝国主义，是决不会死心的，必然还要进行战争挑衅，甚至进行新的军事冒险。对此，必须保持高度警惕。希望你们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，全面落实伟大领袖毛主席一系列的最新指示，认真总结经验，戒骄戒躁，加强战备，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫国防的伟大斗争中，为人民立新功。
