The North China Region Conference on Revolution and Production calls for military and civilians to advance in the red tide of North China. Seriously implement Chairman Mao's great policy of revolution and production. Put revolution in the first place and launch a new high tide in industrial and agricultural production.

The conference pointed out: The idea and practice of opposing revolution and production, or splitting them apart, are not in line with Mao Zedong Thought. True proletarian revolutionaries should strive to be both pioneers of the revolution and models of production.

	New China News Agency, February 18th: Recently, a conference on revolution and production in the North China region was held in Beijing. It called on the proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in the North China region, as well as the People's Liberation Army soldiers executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher in the new year, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, put revolution in the first place, grasp revolution firmly, and promote production vigorously, so that a new high tide in industrial and agricultural production in the North China region can come as soon as possible, and make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	This conference is a meeting to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, and to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions; it is an experience-sharing meeting on promoting production through revolution; it is also a mobilization meeting to advance and grasp revolution firmly and promote production vigorously in the red tide of North China.

	The attendees of the conference repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and discussed the great situation in the North China region. Currently, in the vast North China region, an unprecedented widespread and in-depth movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought has emerged. The entire region has established more than 400,000 study classes of various types, with over 16 million people participating in the study. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions have been grasped by more and more revolutionary masses. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various parts of North China have been thoroughly defeated and are in complete collapse. Their plot to restore capitalism has been completely foiled. Revolutionary committees have been established at various levels. So far, in addition to the five provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that have established revolutionary committees, 32 out of 36 prefectures and leagues have established revolutionary committees. Industrial and agricultural production also shows a great situation. All of these are great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	The attendees of the conference seriously studied Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They unanimously agreed that whether or not this great policy is seriously implemented is an important indicator of whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	The conference pointed out that currently, there are still some one-sided understandings, confused ideas, and wrong thoughts about grasping revolution and promoting production, which must be patiently educated and corrected. For example, opposing revolution and production, believing that grasping revolution means not engaging in production, and engaging in production means not grasping revolution; splitting revolution and production apart, only grasping revolution and not caring about production, or focusing on production and not grasping revolution; some people think that managing production during the Cultural Revolution is not glorious, fearing to be called "production in command," and thus are unwilling or dare not manage production, etc. All these ideas and practices are wrong and do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. The conference believes that revolution and production are both indispensable, but they cannot be treated equally. Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the commander, the soul. We must put revolution in the first place and always use revolution to command and promote production. Revolution takes the lead, but production must not be neglected. Currently, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept their defeat, are trying to sabotage production to sabotage the revolution. We must be vigilant. We must fully understand and seriously implement this great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." True proletarian revolutionaries should strive to be both pioneers of the revolution and models of production.

	The conference emphasized that in implementing the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," we must place the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and heavier than everything, starting from the ideological transformation of people, and arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are the classrooms for studying Mao Zedong Thought and the battlegrounds for criticizing and repudiating oneself and revisionism. We must establish and run well various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, study and apply well Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and ensure that they are fully implemented. Let the spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought blow through every factory, every commune, every department, and every unit. We must study and apply well the "Old Five Articles," spark a revolution in the depths of the soul, thoroughly transform the worldview, smash the "self" and establish the "public," besiege bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and enhance proletarian party spirit. We must correctly handle cadres, quickly achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, form a strong leadership core, and establish a new order of revolution and production. In the process of deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, we must fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base. We must strongly oppose and criticize anarchist trends, strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, promote the ideological transformation of people, and establish the idea of working for the revolution and farming for the revolution.

	Chairman Mao said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." The conference believes that to grasp revolution and promote production, we must rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and launch a mass movement. We must firmly rely on the broad revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must give full play to the initiative and creativity of the masses. We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle of the Dazhai people, not ask for help, not wait, overcome all difficulties, mobilize all positive factors, carry out technological innovations, tap potential, increase production, practice economy, and quickly launch a new high tide in industrial and agricultural production. Currently, we must especially focus on preparing for spring plowing, accumulating and making fertilizer, and developing water conservancy for agriculture, to fight the first battle of spring plowing and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

	The conference also pointed out that leading organs at all levels should streamline their organizations, improve their style of work, maintain close ties with the masses, and have leading members go deep into the grassroots to revolutionize, produce, and solve problems of revolution and production together with the masses. We must be good at discovering and using typical examples to guide work, do a better job in all aspects, and promote the continuous advancement of revolution and production.

	The conference calls on all the People's Liberation Army soldiers executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks to, in the face of a more glorious and arduous situation, definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously implement the principle of supporting the left but not supporting factions, strengthen the leadership of supporting industry and agriculture, do a better job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, and make new contributions to the revolutionary cause. The conference calls on the broad proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres on the economic front to have great aspirations, set high goals, work hard, grasp revolution firmly, promote production vigorously, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and make new achievements in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    华北地区抓革命促生产会议号召军民在华北山河一片红的大好形势下乘胜前进
    认真落实毛主席抓革命促生产伟大方针
    把革命放在首位掀起工农业生产新高潮
    会议指出：把革命和生产对立起来、分裂开来等想法和做法，都是不符合毛泽东思想的。真正的无产阶级革命派，应该既争当革命的闯将，又争做生产的模范
    新华社十八日讯　最近在北京举行的华北地区抓革命促生产会议，号召华北地区的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，以及执行“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军指战员，在新的一年里，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把革命放在第一位，狠抓革命，猛促生产，促使华北地区工农业生产新高潮尽早到来，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利做出新的贡献。
    这次会议，是一次活学活用毛泽东思想，落实毛主席最新指示的会议；是一次以革命带动生产的经验交流会议；也是在华北山河一片红的大好形势下，乘胜前进，狠抓革命，猛促生产的动员大会。
    出席会议的同志反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，畅谈了华北地区的大好形势。当前，在辽阔的华北地区，出现了一个空前广泛深入的大学大用毛泽东思想的新高潮。全区举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班四十多万个，参加学习的人数达到一千六百多万人。战无不胜的毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的最新指示为越来越多的革命群众所掌握。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在华北各地的代理人已被打得落花流水，全面崩溃，他们复辟资本主义的阴谋已经彻底破产。各级革命委员会相继建立起来。到目前为止，除了五个省、市、自治区都建立了革命委员会以外，三十六个专区、盟已有三十二个建立了革命委员会。工农业生产也呈现一派大好形势。所有这一切，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
    参加会议的同志认真学习了毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。一致认为，是否认真落实这一伟大方针，是衡量我们是不是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。
    会议指出，当前，对于抓革命、促生产，还存在着一些片面理解、糊涂认识和错误思想，必须耐心地进行教育和纠正。例如，把革命和生产对立起来，认为抓革命就不能搞生产，搞生产就不能抓革命；把革命和生产割裂开来，只抓革命，不管生产，或者埋头生产，不抓革命；还有的人认为在文化大革命中管生产不光荣，怕人说“生产挂帅”，因而不愿管、不敢管，等等。所有这些想法和做法都是错误的，都是不符合毛泽东思想的。会议认为，革命和生产两方面缺一不可，但又不能等量齐观。毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂。我们必须把革命放在第一位，始终都要以革命统帅生产，带动生产。革命带头，但是不能不搞生产。目前，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于他们的失败，妄图以破坏生产来破坏革命。对此，要提高革命警惕。我们必须全面理解“抓革命，促生产”这一伟大方针，认真落实。真正的无产阶级革命派，应该既争当革命的闯将，又争做生产的模范。
    会议强调指出，在贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针中，必须把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，从人的思想革命化入手，用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑。毛泽东思想学习班是学习毛泽东思想的课堂，是斗私批修的战场。要大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，学好用好毛主席一系列最新指示，做到条条落实、全面落实，让毛泽东思想的春风吹遍每一个工厂，每一个公社，每一个部门，每一个单位。要学好用好“老五篇”，在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。要正确地对待干部，迅速实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合，组成坚强的领导核心，建立革命和生产的新秩序。在深入持久地开展革命大批判和本单位斗、批、改的过程中，要狠批反革命修正主义路线，彻底肃清其流毒，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。要大反特反无政府主义思潮，加强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，促进人的思想革命化，树立为革命做工、为革命种田的思想。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”会议认为，抓革命、促生产，必须依靠群众，发动群众，大搞群众运动。要坚定不移地依靠广大革命工人、贫下中农，依靠决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。充分发挥群众的积极性、创造性。要发扬大寨人艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，不伸手，不等待，克服一切困难，调动一切积极因素，开展技术革新，挖掘潜力，增加生产，厉行节约，迅速掀起工农业生产新高潮。当前要特别抓紧备耕工作，积肥造肥，兴修农田水利，为打响春耕生产第一炮，夺取今年农业大丰收而奋斗。
    会议还指出，各级领导机关要精简机构，改进作风，密切联系群众，领导成员深入基层，和群众一道革命，一道生产，一道解决革命和生产中的问题。要善于发现和运用典型指导工作，把各方面的工作做得更好，推动革命和生产不断向前发展。
    会议号召全体执行“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军指战员，在面临更加光荣和艰巨任务的新形势下，一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真执行支左不支派的原则，加强支工支农的领导，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好，为革命事业做出新贡献。会议号召经济战线上的广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，要树雄心，立壮志，踏踏实实，埋头苦干，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。（附图片）
