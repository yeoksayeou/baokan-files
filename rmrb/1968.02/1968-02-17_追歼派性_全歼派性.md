In places where the revolution has achieved great unity and the three-in-one combination, and revolutionary committees have been established, has the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie disappeared? No. Factionalism is still appearing in various forms in some places.

For example, some people, when investigating situations, go straight to groups that share their views; in meetings, they always refer to "our faction" when speaking; after any meeting, they immediately reveal the content to their own faction.

They carry out tasks assigned by committee members they themselves have elected with great vigor and decisiveness; but they drag their feet or argue face-to-face with tasks assigned by committee members elected by others; they even use whether something is beneficial to themselves as a standard to judge whether the decisions of the revolutionary committee are correct or not; if it is not beneficial, they label everything as a "product of factionalism" or a "factional organization."

They demand that committee members "firmly stand on the side of their own organization" and "wholeheartedly serve the masses of their own organization"; otherwise, they say: "Don't forget who elected you as a committee member!"

They don't speak from the heart when they meet, they suspect each other, and they are on guard. I don't like the look of you, and you don't feel comfortable with me. You don't accept my opinions, and you won't let go of my shortcomings.

All these things, no matter how fashionable and beautiful their outer garments, inevitably reveal the tail of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

At present, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is like a rat crossing the street, and everyone is shouting to beat it. However, as Stalin said: "Things that are declining do not want to die easily. They struggle for their existence and persist in their decaying affairs." Factionalism is such a plague that does not easily retreat. Once one of its faces is exposed, it appears in another form. In short, there is still a market for factionalism in society. Isn't it said: "Factionalism is like stinky tofu, although it smells bad, it tastes good"? Some people, although they dare not make a big fuss about factionalism in public, still cling to it. Once they encounter a "good opportunity," they will still make a big fuss about it. When factionalism breaks out, it damages the unity and solidarity of the revolutionary committee, inevitably weakens the fighting strength of the revolutionary committee, disperses the revolutionary organization, relaxes revolutionary discipline, and weakens the dictatorship of the proletariat. This way, it falls right into the trap of the class enemy. Therefore, no matter what form factionalism takes, it must be completely, thoroughly, and decisively eliminated.

The revolutionary committee is a temporary power organ, not a representative assembly of various revolutionary mass organizations or a federation of factions. Therefore, its committee members and standing committee members are not representatives of any faction, but representatives of all revolutionary masses in the region and unit. They should follow the teachings of Chairman Mao: "Everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on the interests of individuals or small groups." Various revolutionary organizations should not regard the committee members they have elected as spokesmen for their own organizations, demanding that they serve their own factions everywhere. On the contrary, they should support them in wholeheartedly serving the people. In this way, with everyone's hearts united and working together, the work can definitely be done well.

The revolutionary committee is a new thing, and it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings and mistakes in its work. The broad revolutionary masses must follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, starting from the perspective of cherishing it, and give it benevolent criticism and help. Absolutely do not allow the class enemy to shake it or overthrow it from the right and ultra-"left" sides. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the refuge of the class enemy. Therefore, all revolutionary masses must take up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and completely eliminate it to consolidate the revolutionary committee.

    追歼派性　全歼派性
    柳松
    在实现了革命大联合和三结合，建立了革命委员会的地方，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性就销声匿迹了吗？没有。派性还在某些地方变换各种不同的方式登台表演。
    例如，有的人调查情况，迈腿就到同自己观点相同的群众中去；会上发言，开口必称“我那一派”如何如何；开个什么会议，一散会就把内容透露给自己那一派的人。
    自己推选出来的委员布置的工作，雷厉风行，坚决照办；别人推选出来的委员布置的工作，则消极怠工或当面顶撞；甚至用是否对自己有利作为衡量革命委员会的决定正确与否的标准；如果不利，统统称为“派性的产物”，或是“派性机构”。
    要求委员“坚定地站在自己组织的立场上”，“全心全意地为自己组织的群众服务”，否则，就说：“你可别忘了，是谁选你当的委员！”
    见面不说知心话，互相猜疑，有戒心。我看你不顺眼，你看我不舒服。你的意见我不接受，我的缺点你抓住不放。
    凡此种种，不管披上怎样时髦而华丽的外衣，都不免要露出资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的尾巴。
    当前，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性就象过街老鼠，人人喊打。但是，正如斯大林所说：“衰亡着的东西不愿意轻易地死去，它们要为自己的生存而挣扎，坚持自己腐朽的事业。”派性就是这样一种不肯轻易退去的瘟神。它的一种面目被识破，又以另一种面目出现。总之，社会上还有派性的市场。不是有人说：“派性象臭豆腐，虽然很臭，但吃起来挺香”吗？有些人，尽管在众目睽睽之下不敢大闹派性，但对派性依然恋恋不舍，一遇“良机宜辰”，还是要大闹起来的。派性发作起来，损害了革命委员会的统一和团结，势必削弱革命委员会的战斗力，涣散革命组织，松懈革命纪律，削弱无产阶级专政。这样，就正中了阶级敌人的奸计。所以，不管派性以什么形式表现出来，都必须全部、干净、彻底地歼灭之。
    革命委员会是临时权力机构，不是各革命群众组织的代表会和各派的联合会。因此，它的委员和常委，也就不是哪一派的代表，而是所在地区和单位所有革命群众的代表。他们应遵循毛主席的教导：“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。各革命组织不应当把自己选出的委员当作自己一个组织的代言人，处处要求他为自己这一派服务。相反，应当支持他全心全意为人民服务。这样上下一心，大家协力，就一定可以把工作搞好。
    革命委员会是新生事物，工作中难免有缺点、错误。广大革命群众必须按照毛主席的教导，从爱护的角度出发，给以善意的批评和帮助，绝对不能允许阶级敌人从右的和极“左”的方面来动摇它、颠覆它。资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，就是阶级敌人的庇护所。所以，一切革命群众都要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，将它全部歼灭，以巩固革命委员会。
