Under the inspiration of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary masses in Ningxia have launched a mass movement to surround and stamp out factionalism, and the tide of revolutionary great alliance is surging forward.

Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses in Ningxia have resolutely fought against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the autonomous region, achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the class enemies are not reconciled to their defeat. They use the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks to constantly disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, shifting the direction of the struggle. Therefore, the revolutionary great alliance in Ningxia progressed relatively slowly for a period.

In recent days, under the leadership of the preparatory group of the revolutionary committee of the autonomous region and with the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, various revolutionary mass organizations have jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related documents. The broad revolutionary masses are increasingly aware that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a major enemy in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a major enemy in achieving revolutionary great alliance, and a major enemy in seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Overthrowing factionalism and achieving revolutionary great alliance have become the common aspiration of the 200 million people of Ningxia and an irresistible historical trend.

Under the favorable situation where the broad revolutionary masses firmly demand the eradication of factionalism and the rapid achievement of revolutionary great alliance, our great leader Chairman Mao, on December 31 of last year, received the representatives of various factions of Ningxia who were in Beijing to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study class. The great leader Chairman Mao's warm concern has become a great driving force for the representatives of various factions in Beijing to fight against selfishness and eradicate factionalism. They resolutely fought against their own factionalism and quickly reached an agreement on revolutionary great alliance.

The good news brought back to Ningxia has greatly encouraged the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the autonomous region. They are determined to launch a more extensive and in-depth mass movement to surround and stamp out factionalism throughout the region, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, rapidly achieve revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination, and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The working class in Ningxia is at the forefront in the struggle against factionalism. They resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, strengthen the fighting unity of the working class, and will not allow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks of the working class. In industrial centers such as Yinchuan, Shiquanshan, Wuzhong, and Qingtongxia, many factory revolutionary masses have launched mass activities to expose the crimes of factionalism and dig up its roots. Many workers, after denouncing the harm caused by factionalism, said with pain: "We are all class brothers, like bitter gourds on the same vine. The class enemies use factionalism to divide us into two families, turning class brothers into enemies. We will not be fooled by factionalism again." This new situation has given a vivid lesson to those leaders with heavy factionalism, making them wake up and quickly catch up. Some of them held overnight self-criticism meetings, actively inviting the other side to discuss matters of great alliance. The leaders of various factions of the First Coal Mine of the Shiquanshan Mining Bureau, after hearing the report from the delegation of Ningxia factions returning from Beijing, immediately held a self-criticism meeting and reached an agreement on revolutionary great alliance that very night. The leaders of the two factions of the Construction Company of the autonomous region began negotiations for unity in October last year, but because each side emphasized their own correctness and criticized the other, they could not sit on the same bench. The great news of Chairman Mao receiving the representatives of various factions of Ningxia who were in Beijing to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study class has greatly encouraged them. They studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again, focusing on their own ideological problems, and immediately changed from mutual attacks to more self-criticism and more appreciation of the other side's strengths. Therefore, they quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance.

Under the warm concern of our great leader Chairman Mao and the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the broad revolutionary masses in various parts of Ningxia are intensifying the annihilation of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The pace of revolutionary great alliance throughout Ningxia has greatly accelerated. In recent days, from the Yinchuan Plain to the Liupanshan Mountains, a hot and lively scene of revolutionary great alliance is presented everywhere. People, braving temperatures of minus twenty degrees, beat drums and set off firecrackers, continuously surging towards the preparatory group of the revolutionary committee of the autonomous region and the local People's Liberation Army leftist support troops, reporting the good news of achieving revolutionary great alliance. Some grassroots units have not only achieved revolutionary great alliance but also established revolutionary committees.

    在毛主席最新指示鼓舞下大力围剿派性搞臭派性
    宁夏地区革命大联合步伐大大加快
    据新华社银川二日电  在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，宁夏各地无产阶级革命派掀起了围剿派性、搞臭派性的群众运动，革命大联合的浪潮滚滚向前。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，宁夏地区广大革命群众同自治区党内一小撮走资派进行了坚决的斗争，无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。但是，阶级敌人并不甘心自己的失败，他们利用革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，不断干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，转移斗争大方向。因此，宁夏地区的革命大联合一度进展比较缓慢。
    最近以来，在自治区革命委员会筹备小组的领导下，在人民解放军支左部队的热情帮助下，各革命群众组织纷纷联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的最新指示和有关文件。广大革命群众越来越清楚地认识到：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，是全面落实毛主席最新指示的大敌，是实现革命大联合的大敌，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大敌。打倒派性，实现革命大联合，已成为宁夏二百万人民的共同愿望，成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。
    在广大革命群众坚决要求铲除派性、迅速实现革命大联合的大好形势下，我们伟大领袖毛主席于去年十二月三十一日接见各地革命战士时接见了宁夏各派群众组织在北京参加毛泽东思想学习班的同志。伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀，成为宁夏各派在京代表们斗私心、铲派性的巨大动力。他们狠斗自己的派性，很快就达成了革命大联合的协议。
    喜讯带回宁夏，自治区广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众无不欢欣鼓舞。他们决心在全区范围内更广泛深入地开展围剿派性的群众运动，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速实现革命大联合和革命三结合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    宁夏工人阶级在和派性作斗争中，走在最前列。他们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，加强工人阶级战斗的团结，决不让资产阶级、小资产阶级派性侵蚀革命的工人阶级队伍。在工业比较集中的银川、石咀山、吴忠、青铜峡等地，许多工厂的革命群众，展开了群众性的揭派性罪状，挖派性根源的活动。很多工人在控诉派性造成的危害后痛心地说：“我们都是阶级兄弟，是一根藤上的苦瓜。是阶级敌人利用派性使我们分成了两家，把阶级兄弟当成了敌人，我们再也不上派性的当了。”这种新形势给那些派性较重的头头上了生动的一课，使他们猛醒过来，急起直追，有的连夜召开斗私会，主动邀请对方商讨大联合的事宜。石咀山矿务局第一煤矿的各派群众组织负责人，在听了宁夏各派群众组织代表返宁汇报团的报告后，立即召开斗私会，当天夜里就达成了革命大联合的协议。自治区建筑公司两派群众组织的负责人，从去年十月开始谈判联合，由于各自都强调自己一派正确，指责对方，一直坐不到一条板凳上。毛主席接见宁夏各派群众组织在北京参加毛泽东思想学习班同志的大喜讯，给了他们极大的鼓舞。他们针对自己的思想问题，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的最新指示，双方立即由互相攻击变为多讲自己的缺点，多看对方的优点，因此，很快实现了革命的大联合。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，宁夏各地广大革命群众大力围歼资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，整个宁夏地区革命大联合的步伐大大加快了。这些天来，从银川平原到六盘山上，到处呈现热气腾腾的革命大联合景象。人们冒着零下二十度的严寒，敲锣打鼓，鸣放鞭炮，不断涌向自治区革命委员会筹备小组和当地人民解放军支左部队驻地，报告实现革命大联合的喜讯。有些基层单位不仅实现了革命大联合，而且成立了革命委员会。
