Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement
Strongly Protests U.S. Imperialists' Savage Bombing of Chinese Cargo Ships

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 3 -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 3, strongly protesting the heinous crime of U.S. imperialist warplanes savagely bombing Chinese cargo ships docked at Hong Gai and Cam Pha ports.

The statement said: The U.S. imperialists have repeatedly attacked Chinese cargo ships, deliberately committing crimes against the Chinese people. This time, in their conspiracy to provoke war against the People's Republic of China, they have taken a new step.

The statement said that this crime by U.S. imperialism also grossly violated the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement warned that the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the correct position stated in the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on February 1, 1968.

The statement firmly demands that U.S. imperialism must stop all acts of provocation, threats, and attacks on foreign cargo ships coming and going from various ports in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. U.S. imperialism must unconditionally stop bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and must stop its aggression against South Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 3 -- The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on February 3, strongly condemning the crime of U.S. warplanes bombing two Chinese cargo ships docked at Vietnamese ports on January 20 and 27.

The commentary said that the more the U.S. imperialists suffer defeat in their aggression against Vietnam, the more frantic and stupid they become. They not only continue to commit heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people but also have again incurred a new debt of blood against the Chinese people.

The commentary pointed out: The U.S. imperialists' attack on Chinese cargo ships is obviously a deliberate act of provocation. This is undeniable.

The commentary said that the Vietnamese people extend their warmest sympathies to the Chinese crew members of the Hongqi 152 and Hongqi 153 cargo ships who were injured by U.S. bombs while performing their internationalist duties. The Vietnamese people strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' savage provocations against Chinese cargo ships and are determined to give them a more severe punishment, making them pay for the blood debts they owe to the peoples of Vietnam and China.
