	Vietnamese Comrades, You Fight Well!
	Shanghai Medical Equipment Factory Revolutionary Committee

	“In June, the heavenly troops march to eliminate evil, with a ten-thousand-foot rope to bind the rocs.”

	In the new year of 1968, news came of the glorious victories achieved by the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam in their all-out offensives on various battlefields. Comrades in South Vietnam, you fight well! You fight well!

	The great victory of the people of South Vietnam has greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary people around the world and has dealt a heavy blow to the arrogance of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique. We are immensely excited by the great victory of our brothers and sisters in South Vietnam. We salute the heroic people of South Vietnam with our fighting spirit! We must learn from the people of South Vietnam!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: “Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people’s war, any powerful enemy can be defeated.” In the face of the heroic people of South Vietnam, the seemingly powerful American imperialism has further exposed itself as a paper tiger. American imperialism has deployed nearly 500,000 troops, plus tens of thousands of puppet soldiers, yet they have been beaten to a standstill by the 14 million people of South Vietnam. This is a rare miracle in the history of war!

	The New Year’s great victory of South Vietnam fully demonstrates the excellent situation of the Vietnamese people’s war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. The people of South Vietnam and the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people firmly grasp the initiative in the war. The people of South Vietnam can fight whenever and wherever they want, and they have the ability to strike at the lairs of the American aggressors and their lackeys. The New Year’s great victory fully shows that the people of South Vietnam have developed the people’s war to a new height.

	All revolutionary workers in our factory remember Chairman Mao’s teachings: “The 700 million Chinese people are the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people.” We have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people’s war of resistance against American aggression as our unshirkable internationalist duty. Every comrade in our factory feels greatly honored when receiving the task of aiding Vietnam. We all realize that our Vietnamese brothers are on the front line, and we are on the rear. The more we sweat, the more high-quality products we produce to support the front line, the sooner our Vietnamese brothers can drive away the American aggressors. No matter how urgent or difficult the task is, we must complete it ahead of time, with guaranteed quality and quantity. The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are determined to be the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people. We resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the war of resistance against American aggression to the end!

	At present, the revolutionary people of our country are striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is more widely spread, and our people will have more strength to support the just struggle of our Vietnamese brothers. The Shanghai working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition and tempered by the great storm of the January Revolution, is determined to follow Chairman Mao’s teachings to “grasp revolution, promote production, work, and prepare for war,” and make greater contributions in supporting the Vietnamese people’s war of resistance against American aggression. We medical equipment workers are a powerful force within the Shanghai working class. We promise our Vietnamese brothers: whatever you need, we will support you; whenever you need it, we will support you! The Shanghai working class, with red hearts and bright eyes, with a heart for the country and an eye on the world, is determined to fight alongside our Vietnamese brothers and achieve victory together!

	The day of the final victory of the Vietnamese people will not be far off!
	The doomsday of American imperialism and its lackeys is approaching!

	Let us once again enthusiastically shout: Vietnamese Comrades, You Fight Well!

    越南兄弟，你们打得好！
   上海医疗器械厂革命委员会
   “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”
    一九六八年新春，传来了英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量在各个战场上全面出击取得辉煌胜利的捷报。越南南方的战友们，你们打得好！打得好！
    南越人民的这一伟大胜利，大长了全世界革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义和苏联修正主义集团的威风。我们为兄弟的越南南方人民的伟大胜利而感到无比兴奋，我们向英雄的越南南方人民致以战斗的敬礼！我们一定要向越南南方人民学习！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”在英雄的越南南方人民面前，貌似强大的美帝国主义，进一步暴露出纸老虎的原形。美帝国主义投入了近五十万的兵力，再加上几十万伪军，却被一千四百万越南南方人民打得走投无路，狼狈不堪。这是世界战争史上少有的奇迹！
    越南南方人民这次新春大捷，充分表明越南人民抗美救国战争形势空前大好。越南南方人民和越南南方人民解放武装力量牢牢地掌握了战争的主动权。南越军民要在什么时候打，就能在什么时候打；要在什么地方打，就能在什么地方打，而且有能力直捣美国侵略者及其走狗的巢穴。新春大捷充分表明，越南南方人民把人民战争发展到了一个新的高度。
    我们全厂革命职工牢记毛主席的教导：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”我们一向把支援越南人民的抗美救国战争作为自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。我们工厂的每一位同志接到援越任务时，都感到无限光荣。大家认识到，越南兄弟在前方，我们在后方。我们多流汗，多生产优质的产品支援前方，可使越南兄弟早日赶走美国侵略者。无论任务多么紧迫，多么困难，我们都要提前保质保量完成任务。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。我们坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底！
    当前，我国革命人民正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。战无不胜的毛泽东思想空前大普及，我国人民将更有力量支援越南兄弟的正义斗争。具有光荣革命传统的、经过伟大“一月革命”风暴锻炼的上海工人阶级，决心遵照毛主席的教导，“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”，在支援越南人民抗美救国战争方面作出更大的贡献。我们医疗器械工人是上海工人阶级中的一支强大的队伍。我们向越南兄弟保证：越南兄弟要什么就支援什么，什么时候需要，就什么时候支援！上海工人阶级心红眼亮，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，决心同兄弟越南人民战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    越南人民取得最后胜利的日子是不会太远了！
    美帝国主义及其走狗的末日就要到来了！
    让我们再一次热烈地欢呼：越南兄弟，你们打得好！
