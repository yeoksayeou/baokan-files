They earnestly overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and make the revolutionary unity of the working class in the entire city continuously consolidate and develop. So far, the factories, enterprises, and units in the entire city that have achieved revolutionary unity have reached more than 85%.

    大同工人阶级革命大联合不断巩固发展
    新的一年开始后，山西省大同市革命工人以最大的热情、最快的速度，掀起了学习、宣传、贯彻毛主席一系列最新指示的热潮。他们认真克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，使全市工人阶级革命大联合不断巩固和发展。到目前为止，全市实现革命大联合的工厂企业单位，已达百分之八十五以上。占全市产业工人一半以上的大同煤矿，在实现革命大联合以后，建立了革命职工代表大会。
