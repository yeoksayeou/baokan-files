The People's Liberation Army helped the farmers of Longgang Brigade, Changgang Commune, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, to establish "three-in-one" Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which have achieved good results. Most of these study classes are organized by production teams. For production teams that are more dispersed, classes are held in villages or hamlets, allowing men, women, old, and young to attend the Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

Longgang Brigade is an old revolutionary base area where Chairman Mao conducted investigations more than thirty years ago. The brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao have always nurtured the people of the old revolutionary base area, leading them from victory to victory. Many old Red Army soldiers, old Red Guards, and old poor peasants in the study classes talk about revolutionary traditions and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices. Comrade Zhong Yueming, who once participated in the investigation meeting convened by Chairman Mao, introduced Chairman Mao's great deeds of going deep among the masses and caring for the masses. Many young people expressed their determination to resolutely follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and devote their lives to the revolution.

In the study classes, everyone recalls the bitterness of the old society and compares it with the sweetness of the new society; they recall the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line and compare it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This has continuously strengthened the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres' love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, and deepened their hatred for China's Khrushchev and the bourgeois reactionary line. They conducted a special criticism of China's Khrushchev's crime of suppressing agricultural producers' cooperatives and spreading the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract."

The study classes adapt to the characteristics of rural areas, ensuring that both study and production are not neglected. During busy farming seasons, in addition to holding night schools, they also hold study classes in the fields and criticism meetings in the fields. They adopt the method of studying one of Chairman Mao's instructions, criticizing one of China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies, and uprooting one poisonous root, achieving immediate effects.

Longgang Brigade insists on holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making Mao Zedong Thought widely popular.

    长冈办起了学习班
    人民解放军某部帮助江西省兴国县长冈公社长冈大队贫下中农普遍举办了三结合的毛泽东思想学习班，效果很好。这种学习班大部分是以生产队为单位举办的，有的生产队比较分散，就以村湾、屋场为单位举办，这样使男女老少都能进毛泽东思想学习班学习。
    长冈大队是毛主席三十多年前亲自作过调查研究的老根据地。毛主席的光辉思想一直哺育着老根据地的人民，从胜利走向胜利。很多老红军、老赤卫队员、老贫农，在学习班里大谈革命传统，大谈毛主席的伟大革命实践。当年曾经参加过毛主席亲自召开的调查会的老同志钟月明，介绍毛主席深入群众，关心群众等伟大事迹，许多青年纷纷表示坚决紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，干一辈子革命。
    学习班里，大家忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜，不断增强了广大贫下中农和农村干部对毛主席的热爱和忠诚，加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫和资产阶级反动路线的刻骨仇恨。对中国赫鲁晓夫扼杀农业生产合作社，大刮“三自一包”黑风的罪行，进行了专题批判。
    学习班适应农村的特点，做到学习、生产两不误。在农活忙时，除了坚持办夜校外，还把学习班办在田头，把批判会开在田头。并采取学习一条毛主席的指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动谬论，挖除一条毒根的办法，取得了立竿见影的效果。
    长冈大队坚持办毛泽东思想学习班，使毛泽东思想得到了大普及。
