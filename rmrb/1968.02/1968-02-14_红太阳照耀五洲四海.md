The red sun shines over the five continents and four seas. As the world enters a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner, revolutionary people from various countries hold boundless love and faith in Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary people from all over the world, whether they are heroic Albanian comrades or the tiger-fighting heroes of Vietnam; whether they come from various countries around the world or from our friendly neighboring countries, despite their different languages and skin colors, their hearts all turn towards the sun. They bring with them the deep affection of the people from various countries and the most sincere wishes of people all over the world: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Eagerly Promoting Mao Zedong Thought

The crew of the Albanian ship "Fier" fervently love Chairman Mao and actively learn and enthusiastically promote Mao Zedong Thought. They all strive to be red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, learning many of Chairman Mao's quotations and Chinese revolutionary songs. They carry harmonicas or other instruments and hold the red book, promoting Mao Zedong Thought in various forms.

Recently, this ship arrived in our country. As soon as the ship docked, the sailors went to the wharf, streets, and squares to promote Mao Zedong Thought, collectively reciting Chairman Mao's quotations and singing Chinese revolutionary songs. Every time they sing "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," the heroic comrades are very excited, full of passion, and shout in fluent Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Enver-Hoxha and Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong and Enver-Hoxha!" Their promotion greatly encouraged the surrounding Chinese comrades.

The Albanian comrades told us: "We must promote and defend Mao Zedong Thought. Because Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Mao Zedong Thought is an ocean of wisdom, a treasure trove of truth, and the most powerful ideological weapon to oppose and defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Wherever we go, we will promote Mao Zedong Thought, letting Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout the world."

Sincerely Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life

On New Year's Day this year, a Vietnamese ship named "Unity," symbolizing the unity and fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam, arrived at our port. That day, the weather was very cold, with rain pouring down. However, the Vietnamese comrades forgot the cold weather and, with hearts burning with love for Chairman Mao, expressed their New Year's greetings to us. Twenty of them stood neatly on the deck, gazing at the Chinese flag fluttering in the wind, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" They loudly recited Chairman Mao's recent telegram to President Nguyen Huu Tho and Chairman Ho Chi Minh's quotations; they repeatedly touched and admired the Chairman Mao badges they had just received from Chinese friends. The entire crew spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" They linked arms with Chinese comrades and sang songs like "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

That afternoon, Chinese and Vietnamese comrades gathered together, holding a lively discussion meeting and banquet full of fighting friendship. At the meeting, Vietnamese comrades repeatedly praised the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and praised Chairman Mao as the great helmsman of the revolutionary people of the world. When they talked about the brilliant achievements of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression for national salvation, they said it was a great victory of the people's war and thanked the Chinese people for their full support. They also said, "Chairman Mao is the great helmsman of the revolutionary people of the world. The Vietnamese people love him dearly. The Vietnamese people are determined to carry out the war against American aggression for national salvation to the end, until there is not a single trace of American aggressors on our land." During the banquet, Vietnamese friends frequently raised their glasses to toast, wishing the great teacher and helmsman of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, a long life! Wishing Chairman Ho Chi Minh a long life! Wishing the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam eternal!

We Must Sing Praises to the Red Sun

On the evening of November 27 last year, our International Seamen's Club was brightly lit, with drums beating and songs resonating. The giant portrait of the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, hung in the center of the stage, radiating countless rays of light. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team was performing wonderful programs. At that time, more than fifty Pakistani seamen were intently watching the performance. During the performance, they clapped and cheered enthusiastically. When the performance reached the moving scenes praising Chairman Mao, the seamen's hearts could no longer contain their sincere and passionate love for Chairman Mao. A middle-aged oiler stood up, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted emotionally, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" Immediately, the other seamen also stood up excitedly, shouting loudly and rhythmically, "Long live! Long live!" The entire club was filled with a joyful, excited, happy, and blessed atmosphere.

When the performance reached its climax, the Pakistani seamen spontaneously rushed onto the stage, excitedly holding the hands of Chinese friends and saying, "We are Pakistani seamen. We love the red sun Mao Zedong very much. We also want to go on stage to sing praises to the red sun." Our staff happily agreed to their request. The Pakistani seamen lined up on the stage and sang loudly, "There is a golden sun in Beijing," "Song of Sino-Pakistani Friendship," and other revolutionary songs. Amidst the thunderous applause from the audience, the Pakistani seamen on the stage also shouted enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Wishing Chairman Mao a long life! Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship!" The cheers echoed over the Guangzhou Bay.

Long Live Chairman Mao!

One day, a Greek cargo ship struggled and slowly entered our port. The engine made extremely abnormal noises. It turned out that during its long voyage, part of the engine had malfunctioned. When passing by other countries' ports, the captain, with an anxious heart, repeatedly asked to repair the ship on the spot before continuing the voyage. However, the crew members disagreed. They unanimously expressed that they must sail the ship to China for repairs, even if it meant drifting with the wind to a Chinese port. The chief engineer and many seamen who had been to China said with deep feeling, "We trust the new China led by Chairman Mao the most. Only Chinese friends can wholeheartedly serve the people of the world, and only Chinese friends can perfectly repair our ship." Finally, the captain agreed to everyone's opinion. Thus, the cargo ship, with its engine barely moving, struggled into our port. After learning about this, the border inspection station immediately organized manpower and resources to urgently repair the ship. The workers from the Zhanjiang Chemical Factory also rushed over to assist. After a day and a half of meticulous and tense repairs, they successfully repaired the malfunctioning part of the engine, completing the task ahead of schedule. The captain was both surprised and delighted, excitedly asking the Chinese workers, "What magic made you complete this massive repair task so quickly and well?" We workers proudly replied, "Because we are socialist China, the place where the red sun rises. Mao Zedong Thought is the magic and strength." The crew members couldn't help but say, "Ah! Now we have personally experienced the greatness of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. New China is the place longed for by the people of the world." At that moment, everyone stood on the deck and shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    红太阳照耀五洲四海
    在世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，各国革命人民对毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰。千里迢迢来到我国的各国革命人民，无论是英雄的阿尔巴尼亚战友，还是越南的打“虎”英雄；无论是来自世界各国，还是来自我们的友好邻邦的朋友，尽管他们语言、肤色各异，但是颗颗红心向太阳。他们带来了各国人民的深情厚谊，带来了全世界人民最衷心的祝愿：“祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    热情宣传毛泽东思想
    阿尔巴尼亚“发罗那”轮船员，以对毛主席无限热爱的真挚感情，积极学习、热情宣传毛泽东思想。他们人人争当毛泽东思想的红色宣传员，学会了许多毛主席语录歌和中国革命歌曲。他们随身带着手风琴或其他乐器，手捧红色宝书，以各种形式热情宣传毛泽东思想。
    最近，这艘轮船来到了我国。船一靠岸，海员们就到码头、街道、广场宣传毛泽东思想，集体朗读毛主席语录和唱中国革命歌曲。每当唱起《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》时，英雄的战友们都非常激动，热情奔放，用熟练的中国话高呼“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“毛泽东—恩维尔！”他们的宣传大大地鼓舞了周围的中国同志。
    阿尔巴尼亚战友对我们说：“我们要宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想。因为毛泽东主席是世界革命人民心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是智慧的海洋，真理的宝库，是反对和战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派最强大的思想武器。我们要走到哪里就把毛泽东思想宣传到哪里，让毛泽东思想传遍全世界。”
    衷心祝福毛主席万寿无疆！
    今年元旦，一艘以中越两国人民团结战斗友谊而命名的越南“团结”号轮来到了我国港口。这天，天气很冷，寒雨纷飞。可是越南战友忘记了天气的寒冷，怀着对毛主席无限热爱的炽热心情，向我们表达了节日的祝福。他们二十人整齐地立正在甲板上，仰望着迎风招展的中国国旗，一遍又一遍地高声祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！祝愿胡志明主席万寿无疆！他们高声朗读毛主席最近给阮友寿主席的贺电和胡志明主席语录；反复抚摸、端详着刚从中国朋友手里得到的毛主席像章。全体船员情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“胡志明主席万岁！”他们挽住中国战友的手唱起了《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲。
    当天下午，中越两国战友欢聚一堂，举行了充满战斗友情的座谈会和宴会。在会上，越南战友不断地赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，赞颂毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大舵手。他们在谈起越南抗美救国战争的辉煌战果时，都说是人民战争的伟大胜利，他们感谢中国人民的全力支援。他们还说：“毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大舵手，越南人民无限热爱他老人家。越南人民决心把抗美救国战争进行到底，直至我们国土上没有一个美国侵略者的影子为止。”在宴会中，越南朋友频频举杯祝酒，敬祝全世界革命人民的伟大导师和舵手毛主席万寿无疆！祝胡志明主席万寿无疆！祝中越两国人民的战斗友谊万古长青！
    我们要高唱红太阳
    去年十一月二十七日晚上，我国际海员俱乐部灯火辉煌，锣鼓喧天，歌声激荡。高挂在舞台中央的全世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席的巨幅画像放射出万道光芒。毛泽东思想宣传队正在演出精彩节目。这时，有五十多名巴基斯坦海员正聚精会神地观看演出。在演出过程中，他们不时地鼓掌并发出热烈的赞扬声。当演到歌颂毛主席的动人情节时，这些海员内心对毛主席无限热爱的真挚激情再也按捺不住了。一个中年的加油工站了起来，双手高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》纵情欢呼“毛主席！”“毛主席！”。紧接着，其余的海员也激动得一齐起立，发出响亮而有节奏的声音：“万岁！”“万岁！”。这样一呼一应，整个俱乐部呈现出一片欢腾、激动、快乐、幸福的气氛。
    当演出到了高潮时，巴基斯坦海员不约而同地涌上了舞台，激动地握住中国朋友的手说：“我们是巴基斯坦的海员，我们十分热爱红太阳毛泽东。我们也要上台歌颂红太阳。”我工作人员十分高兴地答应了他们的请求。巴基斯坦海员在舞台上一线儿排开，就放声高唱起了《北京有个金太阳》、《中巴友谊之歌》等革命歌曲。随着台下暴风雨般的热烈掌声，巴基斯坦海员在台上也纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“中巴友好万岁！”欢呼声荡漾在广州湾的上空。
    毛主席万岁！
    一天，一艘希腊货轮艰难、缓慢地驶进了我国港口。轮机发出极不正常的音响。原来，这艘货轮在长期航行途中，部分轮机发生了故障。路经别国港口时，船长怀着焦急的心情，三番五次要就地检修后再启航。可是船员们不同意。他们一致表示，一定要把船开到中国检修，哪怕是随风逐浪飘流到中国港口。轮机长和许多到过中国的海员深有体会地说：“我们最信得过毛主席领导的新中国。只有中国朋友才能热心为全世界人民服务，只有中国朋友才能完满地修好我们的船。”最后，船长同意了大家的意见。就这样，这艘货轮在半停顿似的轮机的牵引下，吃力地进入了我国海港。我边防检查站知道这件事后，马上组织人力、物力全力抢修。湛江化工厂的轮机工人也闻讯赶来大力协作。经过一天半细致、紧张的抢修，终于把这部分发生故障的轮机修好了，提前完成了任务。船长又惊又喜，激动地问中国工人：“是什么法宝使你们又快又好地完成了这项庞大的检修工程？”我们工人自豪地回答说：“因为我们是社会主义的中国，是红太阳升起的地方。毛泽东思想是法宝和力量。”船员们情不自禁地说：“啊！现在我们亲身体会到了毛主席和毛泽东思想的伟大。新中国是全世界人民向往的地方。”这时大家站在甲板上齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
