Fongsa Van Ma sternly condemns U.S. imperialism's plot to expand aggression in Laos
Laos people strengthen unity with Indochinese people to defeat U.S. imperialism
Vientiane puppet government's shameless slander and Phouma's speech serve U.S. imperialism's intensified aggression in Laos

KANGA, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- Fongsa Van Ma, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao Three-Party National Union Government, and representative of the Lao Patriotic Front on the National Committee for the Implementation of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos, made a speech on Feb. 23 to the Pathet Lao radio station. He pointed out that the Lao people and people of the world have long recognized that U.S. imperialism is merely a paper tiger. He sternly warned the U.S. aggressors that if the U.S. dares to expand its aggression in Laos, the Lao people will closely unite with the peoples of other Indochinese countries to give them fivefold or tenfold severe punishment until they are thoroughly defeated.

Fongsa Van Ma said: On Feb. 16, Souvanna Phouma met with a United Press International correspondent and extensively propagated his so-called "North Vietnamese aggression against Laos," and hinted that he "will appeal to the signatories of the Geneva Agreement on Laos to decide what actions must be taken." Fongsa Van Ma pointed out: Phouma made this statement at a time when the pro-American puppet government in Vientiane was loudly launching a slander campaign. They falsely accused the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's army of "preparing" to launch a new attack on Laos. The Vientiane government even unilaterally invited the International Control Commission in Laos to conduct a so-called on-site investigation, using the commission as its tool.

Fongsa Van Ma said: It is noteworthy that this new slander campaign was launched immediately after the U.S. puppet army suffered a severe defeat in Nam Bao in southern Laos. Every time their aggressive and destructive actions are punished by the Lao patriotic forces and people, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys repeatedly resort to the trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief'" to deceive public opinion and cover up their failures.

Fongsa Van Ma emphasized that the new slander campaign by the Vientiane puppet government and Phouma's speech serve no other purpose than to pave the way for the U.S. imperialists' new military adventures in Laos.

Fongsa Van Ma said: The U.S. imperialists have used the Vientiane puppet government as a tool to execute their new colonialist policies and as an effective tool for their new colonialist war of aggression in Laos. The so-called "unity government" in Vientiane is merely a puppet government, a product of the military coup staged by the U.S. and the extreme rightists on April 19, 1964. It is merely a "unity government" of the pro-American reactionaries and is not the Lao Three-Party National Union Government established according to the Swiss Agreement and the Plain of Jars Agreement, which was overthrown by the U.S. and its spies in April 1964. Therefore, it cannot be the legitimate representative of the Lao people. The more it helps the U.S. imperialists interfere with and invade Laos, the more it exposes its traitorous nature. Phouma cannot use the name of the "prime minister" of this government to act on behalf of the Lao Three-Party National Union Government.

He said: It is well known that in recent years, the U.S. imperialists, relying on the so-called "requests" and "consents" of the Vientiane government, have reserved the right to act freely in Laos for themselves, disregarding the Geneva Agreement, and wantonly trampling on Laos' independence, sovereignty, and neutrality. They openly sent planes to repeatedly launch savage attacks on the liberated areas of Laos.

Fongsa Van Ma said: The U.S. imperialists have been continuously transporting weapons, military personnel, and military personnel and forces from their puppet countries into Laos to strengthen the puppet army, in order to attack and raid the people. They have intensified their collusion among their lackeys in Vientiane, Bangkok, and Saigon, and used Thai territory as a springboard for their interference and invasion of Laos, used Thai air bases as takeoff points for their bombing of the liberated areas of Laos, and used Lao territory to launch attacks on Vietnam.

He said: Facing their unprecedented defeats in Laos and their predicament in Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors are frantically intensifying the war in Laos to promote their plot to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina. They are intensifying air raids on the liberated areas of Laos and using the puppet army to launch nibbling attacks on the liberated areas of Laos.

He said: Recently, the U.S. imperialists have sent a large number of military personnel to Laos, many of whom are disguised as CIA agents. They have established radar stations and radio networks in areas controlled by the Vientiane puppet government to facilitate air raids on Vietnam and Laos. They are setting up an "electronic barrier" across Laos at a cost of $750 million as an extension of the "McNamara Line" across South Vietnam. At the same time, they are supporting the puppet army with jet planes and helicopters. All of this is a serious violation by the U.S. of the Geneva Agreement on Laos, pushing the new colonialist war of aggression to a new height and further aggravating the already dangerous situation in Laos.

Fongsa Van Ma pointed out: The current clamor of slander by the Vientiane puppet government and Phouma's recent ambiguous statements are the prelude to the U.S. intensifying military adventures. However, these slanders and ambiguous statements can neither deceive public opinion nor intimidate the Lao people.

Fongsa Van Ma, in discussing the decision by the Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Control Commission in Laos on Feb. 16 to organize an "investigation of the military situation in southern Laos," pointed out: This is an illegal act, deliberately sabotaging the Geneva Agreement and violating Lao sovereignty under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism. This also indicates that the Indian and Canadian representatives are colluding with the Vientiane puppet government to plot the current slander campaign, serving the U.S.'s new military adventures. Therefore, the Indian and Canadian representatives must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of this illegal act.

Fongsa Van Ma stressed: The Lao people and world public opinion will not be deceived by the slanders of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. The Lao people will not be intimidated by their threats. The U.S. aggressors have used Phouma to prepare public opinion for the U.S. and its puppet countries to send troops to Laos, which is not the first time. Now they threaten to carry out direct military intervention to blackmail our people. They are closing their eyes to the facts: the U.S.'s "idol" has suffered a shameful failure in South Vietnam. The Lao people and people of the world have long recognized that the U.S. is merely a paper tiger. More than 500,000 U.S. troops are already deeply mired in the quagmire of South Vietnam. Now they hastily send about 10,000 troops to South Vietnam, which is like throwing a few handfuls of salt into the sea. Therefore, the U.S. sending U.S. and puppet troops to Laos will definitely fail. Just as in South Vietnam, the same fate awaits the U.S. in Laos.

Fongsa Van Ma finally said: The Lao people see clearly that the U.S. aggressors cannot escape failure. Yet the Lao people remain highly vigilant against the U.S. aggressors' nature of expanding the war and taking risks. The Lao people sternly warn the U.S. aggressors that they will, in self-defense, not only counterattack all nibbling attacks and raids but also, when the U.S. and its puppet troops directly participate in the aggression against Laos, closely unite with the other brother peoples of Indochina to give them fivefold or tenfold severe punishment until they are thoroughly defeated.

    冯维希严厉谴责美帝阴谋扩大侵略老挝战争
    老挝人民同印度支那人民加强团结打败美帝
    万象傀儡政府的无耻诽谤和富马的谈话为美帝加紧侵略老挝效劳
    新华社康开二十六日电　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记、老挝三方民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、负责执行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议全国委员会老挝爱国战线党代表富米·冯维希二十三日向巴特寮电台发表谈话时指出，老挝人民和世界各国人民早就认识到，美帝国主义只不过是个泥足巨人；并严厉警告美国侵略者，一旦美国胆敢扩大侵略老挝的战争，老挝人民将与印度支那其他人民紧密团结，给予他们五倍或十倍的严厉惩罚，直到把他们彻底打败。
    冯维希谈到：梭发那·富马二月十六日接见美国合众国际社记者时，大肆宣扬他所谓的“北越对老挝的进攻”，并暗示他“将向关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议签字国发出呼吁，应由这项协议的各个签字国去决定必须采取什么行动”的问题。冯维希指出：富马发表这番谈话的时候正好是万象的亲美傀儡政府大吵大嚷地发动一个诽谤运动的时候。他们诬蔑越南民主共和国军队“准备”对老挝“发动新进攻”。万象政府竟于二月十日擅自招来老挝国际委员会，搞所谓现场调查，把国际委员会当成了自己的工具。
    冯维希说：值得注意的是，这个新的诽谤运动是紧接着美国的傀儡军在上寮南博遭到一次惨败之后发动的。每当他们的侵略破坏行动受到老挝爱国力量和人民的及时惩罚以后，美帝国主义者及其仆从便一再施展“贼喊捉贼”的故伎，以便愚弄舆论和掩饰他们的失败。
    冯维希强调指出，万象傀儡政府的新的诽谤运动和富马的谈话，其目的不是别的，只是为美帝国主义者在老挝进行新的军事冒险扫清道路。
    冯维希说：美帝国主义者利用了万象傀儡政府作为执行他们的新殖民主义政策的工具和作为在老挝进行新殖民主义侵略战争的有效工具。目前所谓的万象“联合政府”只不过是一个傀儡政府，它是一九六四年四月十九日由美国和极右集团策划的军事政变的产物。它只不过是亲美的反动派的“联合政府”，而根本不是根据苏黎士协议和查尔平原协议建立起来的、而在一九六四年四月又被美国和它的奸细推翻了的老挝三方民族团结政府。因此，它不可能是老挝人民的合法代表。它越是帮助美帝国主义者对老挝的干涉和侵略，就越清楚地暴露了它的卖国本性。富马根本不能利用这个政府的“首相”的名义来代表老挝三方民族团结政府行事。
    他说：尽人皆知，美帝国主义者在过去的几年中，凭借着万象政府的所谓“请求”和“同意”为自己保留了在老挝自由行动的权利，他们无视日内瓦协议，肆意践踏老挝的独立、主权和中立。他们公然派飞机对老挝解放区一再进行穷凶极恶的袭击。
    冯维希说：美帝国主义者把武器、军事人员以及他们的仆从国的军事人员和军队源源不断地运进老挝来加强傀儡军，以便对人民进行进攻和袭击。他们加紧了他们在万象、曼谷和西贡的走狗之间的勾结，并利用泰国领土作为他们干涉和侵略老挝的跳板，利用泰国的空军基地作为他们轰炸老挝解放区的起飞点，利用老挝领土对越南进行袭击。
    他说：美国侵略者面对着他们在老挝的空前的惨败和他们在越南的困境，正在疯狂地加紧在老挝的战争，以便促使他们实现把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的阴谋。他们正在加紧对老挝解放区的空袭和利用傀儡军对老挝解放区进行蚕食性的进攻。
    他说：近来，美帝国主义者派了大量军事人员到老挝，其中许多人是伪装起来的美国中央情报局特务。他们在万象傀儡政府控制的地区建立了雷达站和电台网，以利于对越南和老挝的空袭。他们正在以七亿五千万美元的代价设立一道横跨老挝的“电子障碍”，作为横跨南越的“麦克纳马拉线”的延伸。同时还用喷气机和直升飞机支援傀儡军。所有这一切都是美国严重地破坏了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，把新殖民主义侵略战争推向一个新的高度，进一步加剧了已经危险的老挝局势。
    冯维希指出：目前万象傀儡政府的喧嚣的毁谤运动，以及富马最近发表的含糊声明，是美国加紧进行军事冒险的前奏。但是，这些毁谤和含糊声明既不能欺骗舆论，也不能吓倒老挝人民。
    冯维希在谈到老挝国际委员会的印度和加拿大代表二月十六日决定组织一次“对下寮军事形势的调查”的问题时指出：这是在美帝国主义者操纵下，蓄意破坏日内瓦协议、侵犯老挝主权的非法行动。这同时表明，印度和加拿大代表同万象傀儡政府勾结一起策划目前的毁谤运动，为美国的新军事冒险效劳。因此，印度和加拿大代表必须对这种非法行动引起的一切后果负完全责任。
    冯维希强调说：老挝人民和世界舆论决不会为美国侵略者及其仆从的诽谤所迷惑。老挝人民也不会为他们的威胁所吓倒。美国侵略者利用富马来为美国及其仆从国派军队到老挝准备舆论，这已经不是第一次了。现在他们扬言要进行直接的军事干涉来对我国人民进行讹诈。他们这样做是闭眼不看事实：美国的“偶像”已在南越遭到可耻的破产。老挝人民和世界各国人民早就认识到，美国只不过是个泥足巨人。五十多万美国军队已经深深陷于南越的泥潭。如今又把一万名左右匆忙拼凑起来的军队派到南越去，这只不过是象往大海里撒几把盐而已。因此，美国把美国及其仆从国军队派往老挝，一定会遭到失败。正如在南越一样，同样的结局也在老挝等待着美国。
    冯维希最后说：老挝人民看得十分清楚，美国侵略者逃脱不了失败。可是老挝人民对于美国侵略者扩大战争和冒险的本性保持着很高的警惕。老挝人民严重警告美国侵略者，他们将在自卫战中，不仅对一切蚕食性的进攻和袭击给予应有的反击，而且他们在美国及其仆从军一旦直接参预侵略老挝的战争时，将与印度支那其他兄弟人民紧密团结，给予他们五倍或十倍的严厉惩罚，直到把他们彻底打败。
