The armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, in order to severely punish the American bandits for intensifying and expanding their aggressive war and brutally slaughtering the Vietnamese people, have recently launched fierce attacks on the enemy in various battlefields across South Vietnam with overwhelming momentum. They have achieved extremely inspiring and brilliant victories. In the early hours of January 31, the brave and cunning liberation forces once again launched a surprise attack on the U.S. "Embassy" in the heart of Saigon, occupying many floors of the "Embassy" building for six hours. At the same time, on January 30 and 31, the liberation forces launched powerful attacks on various battlefields in Saigon and South Vietnam, dealing heavy blows to the American bandits and their lackeys, throwing the enemy into chaos.

According to reports, in the early hours of January 31, the liberation forces, in close coordination with the people of the Saigon-Gia Dinh region, simultaneously launched fierce attacks on many important targets of the U.S.-puppet clique, including the U.S. "Embassy" and the puppet "Presidential Palace." The assault teams of the liberation forces, with exceptionally swift attacks, divided into multiple groups and rushed into the U.S. "Embassy" building, occupying many floors. The U.S. military authorities were immediately thrown into a panic, hastily dispatching two companies of U.S. troops and helicopters to rescue, attempting to enter the building, but were repeatedly repulsed by the fierce firepower of the liberation army. Later, they had to call in paratroopers for rescue. The liberation forces occupied the lower floors of the building for six hours, killing and wounding more than 200 American aggressors.

While attacking the U.S. "Embassy," several other liberation army units also attacked the puppet "Presidential Palace"—the "Independence Palace," the office of the puppet military general staff, the puppet naval command, the Saigon radio station, the New Mountain One base, and three U.S. military camps, fighting the American bandits and their lackeys into a state of utter disarray. According to reports, after the puppet "Presidential Palace" and other places were attacked, the puppet "President" Nguyen Van Thieu's whereabouts were "unknown"; the Saigon radio station stopped broadcasting in the morning of January 31; the New Mountain One Airport announced "temporary closure"; the U.S. "Ambassador" Bunker, during the liberation army's attack on the U.S. "Embassy," fled from his residence in a state of panic under heavy guard and went into hiding. The Associated Press exclaimed that after dawn, "the situation in the city remained serious and chaotic."

On January 30 and 31, the military and people of various places in South Vietnam simultaneously launched attacks on a series of cities, airports, and bases occupied by the enemy, achieving tremendous victories. The U.S.-puppet forces in various places were simultaneously hit hard and were completely in a passive position, taking blows.

On January 30, the liberation army in Quang Nam Province launched its eighth fierce attack on the U.S. airbase in Da Nang, and also attacked many other targets in Da Nang City, Hoi An City, and Tam Ky County. According to Western news agencies, at least 42 U.S. planes were destroyed or damaged, and two warehouses were destroyed at the U.S. airbase in Da Nang alone.

In the early hours of January 31, the military and people of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region simultaneously attacked all military bases of the U.S.-puppet forces from the south bank of the Ben Hai River to Hai Van Pass.

In Hue City, the liberation army, divided into multiple groups, with the assistance of the city's people and many mutinous puppet soldiers, rushed into the city 35 minutes after the battle began, surrounding and annihilating the enemy. The enemy in the command post of the puppet 1st Division was completely wiped out. The liberation army also fiercely attacked various districts within the city and the base of the puppet 7th Armored Regiment in the suburbs, as well as many other targets of the U.S.-puppet forces, and occupied the Hue City radio station. By 6:30 AM, the liberation forces had completely controlled the city. At the same time, the liberation army fiercely shelled the Phu Bai base, where the U.S. Marine Corps 3rd Division was stationed, and many other targets of the U.S.-puppet forces along Highway No. 1.

In Quang Tri City, the military and people of Quang Tri Province attacked, surrounded, and annihilated many enemy forces, completely controlling Quang Tri City.

On January 30, the liberation army in Binh Dinh Province annihilated many South Korean mercenary troops in the center of Quy Nhon City and attacked the Phu Cat U.S. base, destroying many helicopters and annihilating many American invaders.

The liberation army in Binh Dinh Province also simultaneously attacked many enemy targets. They rushed into Nha Trang City, attacked the U.S. 1st Field Headquarters, the Nha Trang military area, enemy barracks, and U.S. logistics bases, and occupied the residence of the puppet "Provincial Governor," the radio station, the railway station, and other important enemy facilities. The liberation army fought bravely, annihilating many U.S.-puppet and mercenary troops.

In the Central Highlands region, on January 30, the military and people of Kontum Province fiercely attacked the enemy's 24th Special Zone and the puppet administrative zone in Kontum City, destroying many barracks and annihilating many U.S.-puppet troops. The liberation army once again occupied and completely controlled the town of Ninh Hoa near Duc Co, annihilating many U.S.-puppet troops.

On January 30, the liberation army in Pleiku Province fiercely attacked the enemy in Pleiku City, occupying the puppet administrative center, radio station, railway station, and two puppet military command posts, annihilating many U.S.-puppet troops.

On the same day, the liberation army in Darlac Province also continuously attacked the enemy's military area and other targets in Ban Me Thuot City. The liberation army fought bravely, intelligently, and flexibly, annihilating many enemy troops. The people of Ban Me Thuot City closely cooperated with the liberation army to attack the enemy, completely controlling Ban Me Thuot City. At the same time, the liberation army also attacked the enemy command post in the town of Loc Ninh, 35 kilometers south of Ban Me Thuot City, causing the enemy heavy losses.

In the Mekong Delta provinces, the liberation forces also continuously attacked the enemy. In Can Tho City, the liberation army attacked the puppet 4th Military Region Headquarters and the U.S. airbase.

Under the heavy blows of the military and people of South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism was thrown into panic. The White House spokesman in Washington exclaimed on January 30 that the situation in South Vietnam was "quite serious," and Johnson was "closely" monitoring the situation. According to reports, Johnson was called out of bed twice that night to receive reports and hastily convened a meeting of military and political leaders to plot new conspiracies to salvage the situation.
