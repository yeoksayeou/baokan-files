	Chairman Mao's Quotations

	You have fought well! Under extremely difficult conditions, you have relied on your own strength to defeat the most vicious U.S. imperialism, driving it into a corner and making it look utterly pathetic. This is a great victory. The Chinese people salute you.

	Telegram to President Nguyen Huu Tho
