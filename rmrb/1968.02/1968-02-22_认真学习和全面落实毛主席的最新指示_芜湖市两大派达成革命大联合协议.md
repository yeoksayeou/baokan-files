Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and driven by the unprecedentedly good situation of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the two major revolutionary mass organizations in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, reached an agreement on revolutionary great unity on February 16. Many units throughout the city have achieved revolutionary great unity by system.

In recent days, Wuhu City has been adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums and gongs. Revolutionary masses reporting good news have been coming and going. Li Degeng, a responsible person from the Anhui Provincial Military Region, and Yu Yongxian, a responsible person from the local garrison, encouraged them to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity, promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The two major revolutionary mass organizations in Wuhu City have not been able to unite in the past due to factionalism. Recently, with the help of the local garrison, they have taken "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and seriously studied and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. Through study, they deeply realized that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is the great enemy of achieving revolutionary great unity and is the manifestation of the struggle between the two lines in the current stage. The class enemy attempts to use factionalism to cover itself, and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat should immediately unite to jointly fight against the enemy. Thus, the two sides stopped the "internal war," each made self-criticisms, actively eliminated barriers, cut off the black hands, and thus promoted the realization of revolutionary great unity.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who are responsible for the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in Wuhu City, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly implemented the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions," actively propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the two revolutionary masses, and did meticulous ideological and political work, making great contributions to promoting the revolutionary great unity of the two major factions.

    认真学习和全面落实毛主席的最新指示
    芜湖市两大派达成革命大联合协议
    新华社合肥二十日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示指引下，在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势推动下，安徽省芜湖市的两大派革命群众组织在二月十六日达成了革命大联合的协议，全市许多单位按系统实现了革命大联合。
    连日来，芜湖市到处红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，报喜的革命群众队伍络绎不绝。安徽省军区负责人李德生和当地驻军负责人于永贤在接待报喜队伍的时候，鼓励他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，巩固和发展革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合。为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利作出新贡献。
    芜湖市两大派革命群众组织，过去由于派性作怪，长期联合不起来。最近他们在当地驻军的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。经过学习，他们深刻地认识到，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是实现革命大联合的大敌，是两条路线斗争在现阶段的表现形式。阶级敌人企图利用派性来掩护自己，无产阶级革命派应当立即联合起来共同对敌。于是，两派争先停止“内战”，各自多作自我批评，主动消除隔阂，斩断黑手，从而促进了革命大联合的实现。
    在芜湖市担负“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻“支左不支派”的原则，积极向两派革命群众宣传毛主席最新指示，深入细致地做思想政治工作，为促进两大派实现革命大联合作出了很大贡献。
