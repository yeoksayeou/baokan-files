Title: Overthrowing Factionalism, We Truly Understand Our Kin

After the two revolutionary mass organizations in our unit recently achieved revolutionary great unity, we are now revising the "Supporting the Army Agreement." One clause in this agreement states: "Learn humbly from the PLA. Learn from their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; learn from their valuable experience of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively." This is the true sentiment of all revolutionary staff in our unit. Just a short while ago, some people, wearing the spectacles of factionalism, did not see things this way!

At that time, the two mass organizations in our unit both thought they were "resounding" revolutionary factions. One wanted to crush the other, and the other wanted to smash the first. It truly became a situation where the two sides could not coexist. Toward the PLA comrades, we also demanded that they support our own faction, regardless of whether our words and deeds conformed to Mao Zedong Thought.

In September of last year, three PLA comrades came to our unit. They had specific responsibilities: one to connect with this faction, one to connect with that faction, and another to handle overall coordination, connecting with both sides. They had a good work style and could insist on principles. For example, once, the faction in power at the time wanted to lend a large sum of money to an external unit. The other faction heard about it and disagreed. It seemed that the two sides were about to start a fight. The PLA comrades analyzed the situation and believed that the money should not be lent, so they persuaded and stopped it. The PLA comrades also had a good relationship with the masses. However, due to the evil of factionalism, we stubbornly divided the three PLA comrades into three factions, mistakenly thinking: the one who connects with our faction is supporting the left; the one who connects with the other side is supporting the wrong side; and the one who handles overall coordination, we called him the "middle faction," meaning he "mixes things up" and "compromises." This poisonous snake of factionalism is truly vicious, even wanting to "split" the PLA! This way, isn't it leaving a gap for the enemy to exploit?

In early December of last year, the PLA sent another propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought to our unit. At that time, our two factions were fighting intensely and could not sit together. On that day, the PLA comrades separately met with us and sincerely said: "Learn from the revolutionary faction comrades!" Originally, we should have humbly learned from the PLA comrades. The PLA comrades were so modest, precisely showing that they were acting according to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao. However, some of our comrades heard this and factionalism flared up again, whispering behind their backs: "The PLA is wrong, learning from the other side, their position is skewed!" In reality, we wanted the PLA to take a stand, solely supporting our faction, and crushing the other side. At that time, factionalism was that serious. Usually, if a certain word or action of the PLA comrades benefited our faction, we would enthusiastically support and applaud it. If not, we would be very cold, even openly expressing opposition. We were mired in the stinking mud of factionalism, unable to distinguish right from wrong towards others and ourselves, completely unable to use Mao Zedong Thought to measure and judge everything.

In dealing with an issue regarding a cadre, we also showed this clearly. This was a mid-level cadre who participated in one faction. Both factions agreed that this cadre should not be overthrown. When the unit held a Mao Zedong Thought study class, the faction to which this cadre belonged advocated that he should participate and sought the opinion of the PLA comrades, who agreed. However, due to factionalism, this faction firmly disagreed. When the PLA comrades propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the masses, they mentioned this cadre's participation in the study. The head of this faction heard about it, factionalism flared up, and he said the PLA was "trying to sow discord between our leaders and the masses" and "disbanding us," firmly disagreeing with the mid-level cadre's participation in the study. The PLA comrades, to both insist on principles and correctly handle the contradictions between the two factions, believed that although this mid-level cadre should participate in the study, it could also be postponed to the next time. This consideration was agreed to by this faction, but the factionalism of the other faction flared up again, complaining that the PLA "did not insist on principles." In summary, when we were led by the nose by factionalism, we all thought we were "absolutely correct." Whoever did not cater to us, we would vent our anger at them, even including the PLA comrades.

Although these things have passed, these lessons should be remembered. We have suffered enough from factionalism. Blinded by factionalism, we could not even recognize our kin, the PLA. The PLA comrades worked day and night to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the past, we also expressed our support for the army, but in reality, we did not fully do so. Instead, we supported our own faction, and then we supported. This was truly wrong.

Now, with the help of the PLA comrades, we have overcome factionalism, achieved revolutionary great unity, and formed a unified revolutionary mass organization. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, we truly understand that the PLA comrades support the left but not factions, act according to Mao Zedong Thought, and we must humbly learn from the PLA comrades. Therefore, we wrote the above words in the "Supporting the Army Agreement."

    打倒了派性更知亲人亲
    江西省汽车运输管理局机关井冈山兵团
    我们单位两派革命群众组织最近实现革命大联合以后，正在修订“拥军公约”。这个公约中有一条写道：“虚心向解放军学习。学习他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线；学习他们活学活用毛泽东思想的宝贵经验。……”
    这是我们单位全体革命职工真正的心里话。就在前不久，有些人因为戴着派性的眼镜，可不是这样看问题哩！
    那时，我们单位的两派群众组织，都以为自己是“响当当”的革命派，你要压垮我，我要砸烂你，真闹成了个势不两立。对解放军同志，我们也是一味地要求支持自己的一派，不管自己的言行是不是符合毛泽东思想。
    去年九月间，有三位解放军同志来到我们单位。他们三人有分工，一个联系这一派，一个联系那一派，另一个抓总的，两边都联系。他们工作作风好，又能坚持原则。比如，有一次，当时掌权的一派，要批借给外单位一大笔款。另一派听说了，不同意，眼看双方就要闹起来。解放军同志作了一番分析，认为不应该外借，就说服制止了。解放军同志和群众的关系也很好。可是，我们由于派性作怪，却硬把三位解放军同志分成了三派，错误地认为：联系我这一派的，就是支左；联系对方的，就是支持错了；而对抓总的那位解放军同志，就叫他“中间派”，意思是说他“和稀泥”，“搞折衷”。派性这条毒蛇真是恶毒透顶，竟然要“分裂”解放军哩！这样，岂不是给敌人留下可钻的空子！？
    去年十二月上旬，解放军又派来了一支毛泽东思想宣传队。那时，我们两派“内战”打得正凶，坐不到一起。当天，解放军同志就分别会见我们，并且诚恳地说：“向革命派同志们学习！”本来，我们应当好好地向解放军同志学习。解放军同志这样谦虚，正说明他们是遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导行事的。可是我们有些同志听了，派性又发作起来，背后议论说：“解放军错了，要向对方学习，屁股坐歪了！”实际上我们是要解放军表态，单独支持我们这一派，把对方“压垮”。当时派性就是这样严重。平时，解放军同志的某一句话，某一个行动，如果对自己这一派有利，就热烈拥护，热烈鼓掌，不然就很冷淡，甚至公开表示反对。我们陷在派性的臭泥坑里，对人对己，分不清是非，根本不能用毛泽东思想来衡量和判断一切。
    在对待一个干部的问题上，我们表现得也很突出。这是个中层干部，参加了一派组织。两派都承认这个干部是不该打倒的。机关里办毛泽东思想学习班的时候，这个干部所在的那一派，主张让他去参加学习，并征求了解放军同志的意见，解放军同志是同意的。可是这一派由于派性作怪，坚决不同意。解放军同志到群众中宣传毛主席最新指示的时候，联系谈到了这个干部参加学习的问题。这一派的头头知道了，派性大发，竟说解放军“要挑拨我们头头和群众的关系”，要“瓦解我们”，坚决不同意那个中层干部参加学习。解放军同志为了既坚持原则，又能正确处理两派组织的矛盾，认为这个中层干部虽然应该参加学习，但也可以推迟到下一次。这个考虑，这一派同意了，那一派的派性却又发作起来，埋怨解放军“不坚持原则”。总之，当我们被派性牵着鼻子走的时候，我们都以为自己是“绝对正确”，谁要是不迎合我，就要对他发作一通，甚至连解放军同志也不例外。
    事情虽然已经过去了，但是这些教训应该记取。我们吃够了派性的苦头。被派性蒙住了眼，我们连亲人解放军都认不清。解放军同志为了宣传毛主席的最新指示，日日夜夜地工作。过去我们也表示要拥军，可是实际上并没有完全做到，而是支持我这一派，我才拥护。真是太不对了。
    现在，在解放军同志帮助下，我们打倒了派性，实现了革命大联合，组成了统一的革命群众组织。我们想想过去，看看现在，真正体会到解放军同志是支左不支派，是按照毛泽东思想办事的，我们必须虚心地向解放军同志学习。因此，我们就在“拥军公约”上，写上了开头的那段话。
