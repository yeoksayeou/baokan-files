Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us:

“It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.” We, the revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Province, have deeply felt the importance of Chairman Mao’s teaching through the long and fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. We have consistently and unremittingly used the great thought of Mao Zedong to wage an uncompromising struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, especially the factionalism of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, guiding our ranks to advance victoriously along Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line.

“Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies will definitely manifest themselves. They will definitely use various means to stubbornly express themselves on political and ideological issues. It is impossible for them not to manifest or express themselves.” This is exactly the case. In early July of last year, when the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of the Revolutionary Masses of Jiangxi Province (hereinafter referred to as the “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee”) was holding a political work meeting to further unify the thoughts and steps of the revolutionary ranks and achieve new victories, some organizational leaders pulled in some organizations, stirred up factional disputes, directed their arrows at the leadership core of the provincial “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee,” disrupted the unity of the revolutionary ranks, and caused some grassroots units to be in a state of long-term division and endless “internal war.”

How should we deal with them? Should we “completely smash” and “resolutely crush” them, or should we help, criticize, and unite with them? The correct resolution of this problem is directly related to whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our province can continue to advance along the course indicated by Chairman Mao. We acted according to Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and solved this problem relatively well.

We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao’s “On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People” and recognized that this divisive force is a concentrated expression of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, a reflection of the struggle between the two lines within the revolutionary ranks. This trend must be resolutely fought against and deeply criticized to consolidate the unity of the revolutionary ranks. However, for the revolutionary mass organizations influenced by this trend, we must see that the vast majority of their members have been our comrades-in-arms, sharing joys and hardships with us. The contradictions between them and us are still internal contradictions. We should, according to Chairman Mao’s teaching of “not only uniting with those who agree with us but also being good at uniting with those who disagree with us, and even those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice,” timely help, criticize, and unite with them to advance together. If we adopt the methods of “smashing” and “crushing” these organizations, it will only exacerbate the division within the revolutionary ranks.

Once, several revolutionary mass organizations under the provincial “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” had a sharp conflict and confrontation with the core organization of this force. The Standing Committee of the “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” immediately coordinated with comrades from the Provincial Revolutionary Preparatory Committee, personally went to the scene to do ideological and political work, and required other organizations under the “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” not to intervene to prevent the situation from escalating. We also convened meetings to repeatedly propagate the party’s policies. In this way, not only was this incident quickly quelled, but the revolutionary masses also learned from it, raising their awareness of correctly handling contradictions among the people.

We deeply realized from the struggle that the working class is the core of the great alliance of revolution, the main force of the Cultural Revolution. They listen to Chairman Mao the most and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle. After the joyous news of Chairman Mao’s personal inspection of Jiangxi and the issuance of a series of latest instructions spread, our “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” and the Workers’ General Headquarters seized the opportunity to educate the worker ranks, arming the worker masses with Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, making the worker ranks in our province always advance firmly along Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line in the struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

Last year, two factions of a secondary vocational school in the Nanchang area engaged in armed conflict. They both went to factories they were familiar with to seek support, but were both rejected. The workers said: “You two factions are both revolutionary mass organizations. Fighting ‘internal wars’ is wrong. We only have the responsibility to persuade and no right to intervene.” Many factory revolutionary organizations also took to the streets to put up slogans, propagating “Unity is glorious, division is shameful, fighting is a crime.” Under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Preparatory Committee, our “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” and relevant organizations formed an investigation team to properly handle this incident, promoting the two factions to gradually move towards unity.

“Support the left but not the factions” is not only a principle that the People’s Liberation Army must adhere to when supporting the broad leftist masses, but also a principle that the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat must adhere to within the organization. Only in this way can we resist and overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance unity, and jointly fight against the enemy. If we support any organization with the same viewpoint and system, regardless of whether their actions are correct or not, it will inevitably foster factionalism and exacerbate division. Therefore, our “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” has always adhered to the principle of “supporting the left but not the factions.” No matter which faction or viewpoint you belong to, as long as you act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, we will resolutely support you; as long as you go against Chairman Mao’s instructions, we will sincerely criticize and help you.

When two factions of a school engaged in “internal war,” one faction sent people to a construction worker revolutionary organization that had previously supported them to seek support. At that time, some people advocated accepting this request, saying: “They supported us in the past, if we don’t go to support them, it would be ungrateful!” The leader of this organization replied based on the principle of “supporting the left but not the factions”: “For the sake of defending Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, you fought with us in the past, and we are very grateful. However, the contradictions between your two revolutionary organizations should be resolved according to Chairman Mao’s teaching of ‘each side making more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences.’ If we replace policy with emotions and support one side, it will only deepen your opposition, which goes against Chairman Mao’s instructions, pushing you further down the wrong path. That would truly be ungrateful!” They persuaded the students who came to seek support. However, a few people in their own organization, in a moment of emotional excitement, went to the streets to put up slogans supporting one faction against the other. The leader discovered this and immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao’s latest instructions: “Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations should achieve revolutionary great unity. As long as both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great unity under revolutionary principles.” After those few people realized their mistake of supporting bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, they went to the streets to cover up the original slogans.

A “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” organization in a prefecture was attacked by another organization. They thought it was a “class enemy attempting to seize power back” and requested our provincial “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” to issue a statement supporting them. We did not act rashly but instead conducted a detailed investigation and understanding of the situation. We believed that the actions of that organization were wrong, poisoned by factionalism, but not the so-called counterattack of class enemies. Therefore, we proposed appropriate criticism to this prefecture’s “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” organization, suggesting that they follow the policy of “help, criticize, and unite” to eliminate differences with the other side, overcome factionalism, and achieve unity. Later, both sides, through making more self-criticism, achieved revolutionary great unity.

Many actual situations have proven that if two factions in any region or unit are in long-term division and endless “internal war,” there must be capitalist roaders or ghosts and snakes in hiding behind the scenes. In the Nanchang area, this force representing the ultra-left trend has always refused to unite with us because there is a capitalist roader manipulating within it. After the fall of a small group of capitalist roaders like Fang Zhichun, he raised the banner of “rebellion,” infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and long engaged in divisive activities. He colluded with a few bad leaders of several organizations, gathered a group of people, deceived some masses, set up another faction, failed several times, changed his appearance several times, and opposed the provincial “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee.”

To educate the broad revolutionary masses, severely strike at the capitalist roaders behind the scenes, under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Preparatory Committee, we actively invited the masses of the opposing organization to join us in criticism and struggle. Through mass exposure, criticism, and struggle, the broad masses saw through the counter-revolutionary true face of this capitalist roader, drew a clear line with the capitalist roaders, and stood on Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

We also seized the opportunity to mobilize the masses extensively, launching the “three investigations” activity (investigating the behind-the-scenes activities of capitalist roaders, investigating traitors and spies, investigating the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists), in conjunction with the purification of our class ranks.

Through studying Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and launching the “three investigations” activity, the broad revolutionary factions deeply realized that factionalism is the biggest obstacle to implementing Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. Some comrades were poisoned by factionalism, lost the direction of the struggle, which is a very painful lesson.

Now, our provincial “Great Alliance Preparatory Committee” and its affiliated organizations at all levels have held “swearing-in” meetings to “completely implement Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and thoroughly smash bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism,” denouncing the harm of factionalism, listing the crimes of factionalism, and waging a “people’s war” to besiege factionalism. A strong wind of swiftly implementing Chairman Mao’s latest instructions is sweeping across Jiangxi.

    坚持原则  善于引导
    江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：
  “必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”我们江西省无产阶级革命派，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的长期的激烈的搏斗中，深刻地体会到毛主席这个教导的重要性，始终不断地用伟大的毛泽东思想，同资产阶级和小资产阶级思想，特别是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，进行了不调和的斗争，引导我们的队伍沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
      “资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映不表现，是不可能的。”事实正是这样，在去年七月初，正当我们江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会（下称“大联筹”）召开政治工作会议，进一步统一革命队伍的思想和步伐，夺取新胜利的时候，某些组织的负责人，拉拢一些组织，大闹派性纠纷，把矛头指向省“大联筹”的领导核心，破坏革命队伍的团结，使一些基层单位的两大派“内战”不休，长期处于分裂状态。
    怎样对待他们呢？是“彻底摧垮”、“坚决砸烂”，还是帮助、批评、联合？这个问题能否正确解决，直接关系到我省无产阶级文化大革命能否继续沿着毛主席指引的航道胜利前进。我们遵照毛主席的最新指示办事，较好地解决了这个问题。
        严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，坚决
      执行毛主席关于“不同质的矛盾，只有用
      不同质的方法才能解决”的教导
    我们反复学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，认识到：这股分裂势力，是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的集中表现，是两条路线的斗争在革命派内部的反映。对这种思潮必须进行坚决的斗争和深刻的批判，才能巩固革命队伍的团结。但是，对于受这种思潮影响的革命群众组织，必须看到它们之中的广大群众，曾经是和我们同甘苦、共患难的战友。他们和我们之间的矛盾，仍然是内部矛盾。我们应该按照毛主席关于“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”的教导，及时帮助他们，批评他们，团结他们一道前进。如果对这些组织采取“摧垮”、“砸烂”的办法，那就会加剧革命队伍的分裂。
    有一次，省“大联筹”所属几个学校的革命群众组织，同这股势力的核心组织发生了尖锐的矛盾和冲突。我们“大联筹”常委立即协同省革筹小组同志，亲自到现场做思想政治工作，并要求“大联筹”所属其他组织不要介入，以防事态继续扩大。我们又召集会议，反复宣传党的政策。这样，不仅迅速平息了这场风波，而且使无产阶级革命派从中接受了教训，提高了正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的认识。
          紧紧依靠工人革命组织，坚决抵制派
      性的侵袭，保证革命队伍始终坚持斗争大
      方向
    我们从斗争中深深认识到：工人阶级是革命大联合的核心，是文化大革命的主力军。他们最听毛主席的话，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。当伟大领袖毛主席亲临江西视察并发出一系列最新指示的喜讯传开以后，我们“大联筹”和工人总指挥部，都抓紧对工人队伍的教育，用毛主席最新指示武装工人群众，使我省的工人阶级队伍在同资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的斗争中，一直坚定地沿着毛主席的革命路线前进。
    去年，南昌地区的一个中等专业学校的两派组织发生武斗，他们分别到自己熟悉的工厂去求援，但都被拒绝了。工人们说：“你们两派都是革命群众组织，打‘内战’是错误的。我们只有劝阻的责任，没有介入的权利。”很多工厂的革命组织，还纷纷上街刷标语，宣传“联合光荣，分裂可耻，武斗有罪”。在省革筹小组的领导下，我们“大联筹”和有关组织组成调查组，对这一事件作了妥善处理，促使两派逐步走向联合。
        以人民解放军为榜样，对所属革命组
      织也要坚持“支左不支派”原则
      “支左不支派”，不仅是人民解放军在支持左派广大群众时必须坚持的原则，而且是无产阶级革命派队伍内部必须坚持的原则。只有这样，才能抵制和打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强团结，共同对敌。如果我们对同一个观点、同一个系统的组织，不管它的行动正确不正确，一律支持，就必然助长派性，加剧分裂。所以，我们“大联筹”一直坚持“支左不支派”的原则，不管你是那个观点那个派，凡是按照毛主席指示办事的，就坚决地支持；凡是违背毛主席指示的，就诚恳地批评、帮助。
    有个学校的两派组织发生“内战”时，有一派派人到自己曾经支持过的一个建筑工人革命组织去要求声援。当时，有人主张接受这个要求，他们说：“人家支持过我们，我们要是不去声援，就是忘恩负义！”这个组织的负责人根据“支左不支派”的原则回答说：“为了捍卫毛主席的革命路线，你们过去同我们一道战斗，我们很感激。但是，你们两个革命组织之间的矛盾，应该按照毛主席‘各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异’的教导解决。我们如果以感情代替政策，支持你们一方，只会加深你们的对立，这就违背了毛主席的指示，把你们往错误的道路上越推越远，那才真正是忘恩负义！”他们说服了前来要求声援的同学。可是，本组织有几个人一时感情激动，上街刷了支持一派反对一派的标语。负责人发现后，马上组织大家学习毛主席的最新指示：“革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合。只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”那几个人认识到自己支持了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的错误以后，就上街去把原来的标语盖掉了。
    有一个专区的“大联筹”组织，受到另一个组织的冲击。他们认为是“阶级敌人企图反夺权”，要求我们省“大联筹”发表声明支持他们。我们没有轻率行动，而是详细地调查了解情况。我们认为那个组织的行动是错误的，是受了派性的毒害，但不是所谓阶级敌人的反扑。因此，我们对这个专区的“大联筹”组织提出了适当的批评，建议他们按照“帮助、批评、联合”的方针，和对方消除分歧，打倒派性，实现联合。后来，双方经过各自多做自我批评，实现了革命的大联合。
        深入开展“三查”活动，揭露阶级敌
      人的阴谋，教育广大革命群众，克服派
      性，增强党性，联合起来，共同对敌
    许多实际情况证明，无论那个地区，那个单位，如果两派长期处于分裂，“内战”不休，必定有走资派或牛鬼蛇神在幕后活动。在南昌地区，代表极“左”思潮的这股势力，一直不肯和我们联合，就因为有一个走资派在里面操纵。他在方志纯等一小撮走资派垮台以后，打起“造反”的旗号，混入了革命派的队伍，长期进行分裂活动。他勾结几个组织的坏头头，拉起一股人马，蒙骗一些群众，另立山头，几次失败，几次改头换面，同省“大联筹”闹对立。
    为了教育广大革命群众，狠狠打击幕后操纵的走资派，在省革筹小组的领导下，我们主动邀请对立面组织的群众和我们一道进行批判斗争。经过群众性的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，广大群众看清了这个走资派的反革命真面目，纷纷与走资派划清界线，站到了毛主席的革命路线上来。
    我们还因势利导，广泛发动群众，大搞“三查”活动（即查走资派的幕后活动，查叛徒、特务，查地富反坏右的破坏活动），结合清理我们的阶级队伍。
    经过学习毛主席最新指示和开展“三查”活动，广大革命派深刻地认识到：派性是落实毛主席最新指示的最大障碍。有些同志中了派性的毒，迷失了斗争大方向，这是很沉痛的教训。
    现在，我们省“大联筹”及所属各系统的组织，层层召开了“全面落实毛主席最新指示，彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性”的誓师大会，控诉派性的毒害，历数派性的罪状，打一场围剿派性的“人民战争”。一股迅速落实毛主席最新指示的强劲东风，正席卷全江西。
