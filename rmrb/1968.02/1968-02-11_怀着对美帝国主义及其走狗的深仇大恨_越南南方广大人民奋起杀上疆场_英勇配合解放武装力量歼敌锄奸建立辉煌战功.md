With deep hatred for American imperialism and its lackeys, the broad masses of people in South Vietnam have risen to the battlefield. They bravely coordinate with the liberation armed forces to annihilate the enemy, root out traitors, and achieve glorious victories.

Your victories once again demonstrate that, regardless of a country's size, it must fully mobilize the people, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war. Any powerful enemy can be defeated.

	Mao Zedong

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 10 — In the powerful offensive since the New Year, people from various strata in cities and countryside of South Vietnam have been widely mobilized, organized, and armed. In less than ten days, in forty-three provincial capitals and major cities, and hundreds of counties and towns, millions of people from various strata, along with the people in enemy-occupied rural areas, have risen up in arms. Together with the liberation armed forces, they have bravely fought, struck at the American puppet regime, and achieved glorious victories.

	On the night of January 29, the eve of the New Year, as the liberation armed forces launched a full-scale attack, the people in various cities, who harbor deep hatred for the American puppet clique and have long yearned for liberation, immediately took action. They coordinated with the liberation armed forces to launch attacks on the enemy. The vast cities turned into a vast sea of people's war.

	From the central to the southern regions, in cities and towns such as Saigon, Da Nang, Hue, or in the Mekong Delta's Cho Doc, Ben Tre, and My Tho, the people who rose up in arms destroyed enemy strongholds, smashed the puppet regime's ruling institutions, captured and punished the puppet regime's thugs, and fought alongside the people's children to attack the enemy in the streets. In just a few days, tens of thousands of young people in the Mekong Delta alone took up arms and rushed to the battlefield. In Hue, a city with a glorious tradition of struggle, by February 3, over a thousand students and young people had joined the ranks of the anti-American, national salvation struggle and had achieved their initial victories. In the fierce street battles in Saigon, people saw monks and nuns in robes aiming and firing at puppet soldiers and police. In Ben Tre, women who rose up in arms captured the enemy's Di Mountain outpost with bare hands on February 2, forcing all the defending enemies to surrender and seizing a large number of weapons to present to the liberation armed forces.

	In many cities, the people established combat groups, armed themselves with weapons seized from the enemy, and defended the cities and streets. In My Tho, the liberation armed forces opened the enemy's ammunition depot that had been captured, distributing weapons to the people who had risen up. The people in various cities also spontaneously organized street security and anti-traitor groups to continue pursuing and capturing the most evil puppet regime thugs who had fled, ensuring that they would not escape the severe judgment and punishment of the revolutionary people. In the newly liberated areas, large numbers of young people eagerly volunteered to join the ranks of the liberation armed forces to defend their homes and country. In just one region of Dinh Tuong Province, five hundred young people enlisted in the army. The people's patriotic armed forces are continuously growing stronger, and the surging tide of mass struggle is rising.

	In the battles, the liberation army and the people's flesh-and-blood bond has become even tighter. In My Tho, the people braved the enemy's mad bombing and fierce artillery fire to help the troops transport ammunition and supplies and build street barricades. In the battle to attack the village of Xuan Son in the Quang Tri region, the people of various ethnic groups in the western part of Quang Tri Province were commended by the battlefield command for their outstanding service in supporting the battlefield. The liberation armed forces that advanced into Saigon, after fighting the enemy for several days and nights, still, despite the fatigue of intense battle, enthusiastically helped the people extinguish the fires caused by enemy bombing, treated the injured residents, and helped the people dig air-raid shelters and bunkers to protect them from the bombing and strafing of American and puppet planes. In the cities and regions controlled and occupied by the liberation armed forces, the soldiers loved the people, and the people supported the soldiers, presenting a moving scene of harmony.

	To coordinate with the attacks on the cities, the people in the vast rural areas and suburban regions also rose up to attack many enemy strongholds and puppet military institutions, smashing the puppet regime's chains of rule, destroying "strategic hamlets," and disrupting water and land transportation, making it impossible for the enemy to support each other. On January 31, when the liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on Tra Vinh, the military and people of other parts of Tra Vinh Province closely coordinated, launching attacks in all directions, surrounding various strongholds, and cutting off various transportation routes, making it impossible for the enemy to rescue Tra Vinh. On February 1 and 2, the liberation armed forces continued to annihilate the enemy within the city of Binh Long, while the military and people of the surrounding areas of Long Phu, Phuoc Vinh, Chau Thanh, and Tri An rose up to surround many enemy strongholds and outposts, forcing and dissolving hundreds of enemy soldiers to surrender, and destroying and cutting off many roads leading to the city, routing entire enemy battalions guarding the roads. In My Tho, the people destroyed the puppet regime's ruling institutions around My Tho, forcing the enemy in seven strongholds and outposts to surrender or retreat. In Go Cong County of Gia Dinh Province and the suburbs of the capital of Tuyen Duc Province, thousands of guerrillas and people, during the liberation armed forces' attacks on Go Cong Town and Tuyen Duc City, rose up, moved out furniture, set up roadblocks on several roads, destroyed many road sections, and blew up many bridges, paralyzing the enemy's transportation.

	With the brave rise of the people in the vast rural areas, the collapse of the American puppet regime's grassroots ruling institutions in various places has accelerated, and the enemy's plan to "pacify" the countryside has been foiled.

    怀着对美帝国主义及其走狗的深仇大恨
    越南南方广大人民奋起杀上疆场
    英勇配合解放武装力量歼敌锄奸建立辉煌战功
    你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，中要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。
                                    毛泽东
    新华社河内十日电　在新春以来惊天动地的强大攻势中，越南南方城乡各阶层人民已经广泛地动员起来，组织起来，武装起来。在不到十天的短短时间里，四十三个省会和大城市，成百个县城和市镇的数以百万计的各阶层人民和敌占区农村广大人民，纷纷揭竿而起，同解放武装力量一起英勇作战，打击美伪政权，建立了辉煌的战功。
    一月二十九日除夕的夜晚，解放武装力量全面进攻的枪声一打响，对美伪集团怀着深仇大恨、早就渴望解放的各个城市的成千上万人民，马上行动起来，配合解放武装力量向敌人展开进攻。广大的城市，变成了浩瀚的人民战争的汪洋大海。
    从中部到南部的各个城镇，无论是在西贡、岘港、顺化，或是在湄公河三角洲的朱笃、槟椥、美萩，揭竿而起的人民，摧毁敌军据点，捣毁伪政权统治机构，捉拿和惩办伪政权恶棍，同人民的子弟兵一道，攻打街区里的敌人。在短短的几天里，仅湄公河三角洲就有数以万计的青年拿起武器，杀上疆场。在有着光荣斗争传统的顺化市，截至二月三日的三天中，就有一千多名学生和青年投入了抗美救国的战斗行列，立下了他们最初的战功。在西贡市内激烈的巷战中，人们看见身穿袈裟的和尚和尼姑，也在端起枪瞄准伪军警开火。槟椥省奋起战斗的妇女们，在二月二日赤手空拳拿下了敌军的丐山哨所，迫使全部守敌投降，并且缴获大批武器，献给解放武装力量。
    许多城市的人民，纷纷成立了战斗小组，用缴获敌人的武器武装自己，保卫城市和各个街区。在美萩省，解放武装力量打开被攻占的敌人军火库，把武器分发给起义的人民。各个城市的人民群众，还自动地组织起一个个街道治安锄奸小组，继续追捕潜逃的罪大恶极的伪政权恶棍，使他们一个个都逃不脱革命人民的严厉审判和惩处。新解放地区的广大青年，踊跃地要求参加解放武装力量的队伍，保家卫国。仅在迪石省的一个地区就有五百名青年报名参军。人民爱国武装力量正在不断地壮大，汹涌澎湃的群众斗争热潮正在兴起。
    在战斗中，解放军和人民的血肉深情凝结得更加紧密了。在美萩市，人民冒着敌机的疯狂轰炸和猛烈的炮火，帮助部队输送弹药给养，修筑街垒工事。在攻打溪山地区卫村的战斗中，广治省西部的各族人民，由于在为战场服务的工作中做出了出色的成绩而受到战场指挥部的表扬。攻进西贡市的解放武装力量，在和敌人鏖战了好几个日日夜夜之后，仍旧不顾激烈战斗后的疲劳，热情地帮助人民扑灭由于敌机轰炸而引起的大火，为受伤的居民进行治疗，并且帮助人民挖防空壕和掩体，保护他们免遭美伪集团飞机的轰炸扫射。在解放武装力量控制和占领的城市地区，军爱民，民拥军，呈现出一片鱼水融洽的动人情景。
    为了配合进攻城镇的战斗，广大农村地区和城市郊区人民，也奋起进攻敌军的许多据点和伪军事机关，粉碎伪政权的统治枷锁，捣毁“战略村”，破坏水陆交通，使各处的敌人无法互相接应。一月三十一日，当解放武装力量向茶荣市发动猛烈进攻的时候，茶荣省其它各地军民紧密配合，四处出击，包围各个据点，切断各条交通要道，使敌人无法向茶荣市救援。二月一日和二日，进攻薄寮市的解放武装力量继续在城内歼灭敌人，而薄寮市周围的龙富、富友、州庆和长庆等地军民，奋起包围敌人许多据点哨所，迫降和瓦解成百名敌军，并且破坏和切断通往市区的许多公路，击溃守卫公路的成营敌人。在美萩省，人民捣毁了美萩市周围的伪政权统治机构，迫使七个据点和哨所的敌人投降或撤走。嘉定省古芝县和土龙木省省会四郊，数以千计的游击队和人民，在解放武装力量进攻古芝县城和土龙木市时，纷纷起来，搬出家具，在好几条公路上设置路障，破坏许多路段，炸毁许多桥梁，使敌人的交通陷于瘫痪。随着广大农村地区人民的英勇奋起，加速了美伪集团在各地的基层统治机构的土崩瓦解，使敌人“绥靖”农村的计划破产。（附图片）
