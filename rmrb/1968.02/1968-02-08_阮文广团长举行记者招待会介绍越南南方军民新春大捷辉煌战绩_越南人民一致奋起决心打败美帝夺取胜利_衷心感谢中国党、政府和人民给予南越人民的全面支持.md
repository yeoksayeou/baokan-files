Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, Head of the Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, held a press conference in Beijing today for Chinese and foreign journalists to report on the brilliant achievements of the South Vietnamese military and people in the recent Tet Offensive. Nguyen Van Hieu said that on the basis of the new victories, the South Vietnamese military and people will launch more powerful, broader, and deeper general offensives to annihilate the American aggressors, overthrow the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, and achieve complete victory.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu said that on the battlefield in South Vietnam, the South Vietnamese military and people have never, in such a broad scale, launched a full, universal, and effective offensive at such a rapid speed against the American imperialists and their lackeys. From Quang Tri to Can Tho, the patriotic people of all strata in South Vietnam have never, in such a short period, risen up with such a surging momentum to stage uprisings. Nguyen Van Hieu's vivid and inspiring report aroused wave after wave of enthusiastic applause in the conference hall.

Nguyen Van Hieu said that the recent victories we have won show the South Vietnamese military and people's ability to launch fierce, comprehensive, and sustained offensives against the enemy. They demonstrate our leap in leadership, command, strategy, tactics, and technology, and prove that the South Vietnamese military and people will surely defeat the 120,000 American, puppet, and mercenary troops in South Vietnam.

Nguyen Van Hieu said that the victories of the South Vietnamese military and people are the victories of the correct program of the National Liberation Front. The program of the National Liberation Front is pushing the South Vietnamese revolution to a new high tide.

He said that now, the more than one million American, puppet, and mercenary troops in South Vietnam are in a state of utter chaos. At the same time, he pointed out that the nature of American imperialism will not change until its death. It is trying to salvage its defeat in South Vietnam. No matter how barbaric the means it adopts or how frantically it struggles, it cannot escape the fate of failure.

Nguyen Van Hieu said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the South Vietnamese military and people have full confidence in the iron will of the Vietnam Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by the great leader of the entire Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, to support the revolutionary cause in the South. The 14 million military and people of South Vietnam are determined to advance shoulder to shoulder with their fellow countrymen in the North, to strike more fiercely at the American imperialists and their lackeys, to achieve their combat goals, to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam, and to peacefully reunify the motherland.

Nguyen Van Hieu said that the congratulatory telegram sent by Comrade Mao Zedong on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, and the telegram sent by Premier Zhou Enlai on February 2 to congratulate the South Vietnamese military and people on their Tet Offensive victories, are great encouragement for us to mobilize the people of South Vietnam to advance and win more brilliant victories. On behalf of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, I sincerely thank the People's Republic of China, the 700 million Chinese people, and the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong for their enthusiastic and comprehensive support to the people of South Vietnam.

Nguyen Van Hieu said, our struggle is just. We have the correct political line, the strength of the people's war, the will of the entire Vietnamese people to fight to the end, and the sympathy and support of the revolutionary people of the whole world. Our struggle against American aggression for national salvation will surely achieve final victory.

    阮文广团长举行记者招待会介绍越南南方军民新春大捷辉煌战绩
    越南人民一致奋起决心打败美帝夺取胜利
    衷心感谢中国党、政府和人民给予南越人民的全面支持
    新华社七日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，今天在北京举行中外记者招待会，介绍了越南南方军民最近在新春全面出击中所取得的无比辉煌的胜利。阮文广说，越南南方军民在新的胜利的基础上，将更猛烈、更广泛、更深入地发起总进攻，消灭美国侵略者，打倒阮文绍—阮高其集团，夺取彻底胜利。
    阮文广团长说，在越南南方战场上，南方军民从来没有象在最近几天那样，在广泛的规模上，全面地、普遍地、有效地以飞快的速度向美帝国主义及其走狗大举进攻；从广治到金瓯的越南南方各阶层爱国人民，从来没有象在最近几天那样，一致奋起，以汹涌澎湃的气势举行起义。阮文广作的生动的振奋人心的介绍，在会场上激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
    阮文广说，我们最近取得的胜利，显示了越南南方军民对敌人进行猛烈的、全面的和持续的进攻的能力，说明我们在领导、指挥、战略、战术和技术等方面的水平有了飞跃的成长，说明越南南方军民一定能够彻底击败在越南南方的一百二十万美军、伪军和仆从军。
    阮文广说，越南南方军民取得的胜利，是越南南方民族解放阵线的正确纲领的胜利。民族解放阵线的纲领正在把越南南方革命推向一个新的高潮。
    他说，现在，在越南南方的一百多万美军、伪军和仆从军正处于狼狈万状的困境。他同时指出，美帝国主义的本性至死不会改变，它正在设法挽救它在越南南方的败局。不管美帝国主义还将采取怎样野蛮的手段，怎样进行疯狂的挣扎，都逃不开失败的命运。
    阮文广说，越南南方民族解放阵线和南方军民，对以全体越南民族的伟大领袖胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府对南方革命事业的钢铁决心充满了信心。一千四百万越南南方军民决心与骨肉的北方同胞，肩并肩地乘胜前进，更猛烈地打击美帝国主义及其走狗，实现自己的战斗目标，建立一个独立、民主、和平、中立与繁荣的越南南方，进而和平统一祖国。
    阮文广说，敬爱的毛主席在庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年给阮友寿主席的贺电，周恩来总理二月二日为庆贺越南南方军民新春大捷给阮友寿主席的电报，是对我们动员越南南方人民乘胜前进，夺取更辉煌胜利的巨大鼓舞。我代表越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会，衷心感谢中华人民共和国、七亿中国人民和以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党给予越南南方人民热情的和全面的支持。
    阮文广说，我们的斗争是正义的，我们有正确的政治路线，有人民战争的力量，有全体越南人民决战决胜的意志，有全世界革命人民的同情和支持，我们的抗美救国事业必将获得最后的胜利。
