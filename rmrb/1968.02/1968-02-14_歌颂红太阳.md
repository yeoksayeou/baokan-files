	Praising the Red Sun

	“East is Red, the Sun Rises”
	On the eve of last year's National Day, one evening, the sailors' club was brightly lit, and the singing was lively. This was a gathering of sailors from various countries with us, celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	The evening was very lively. Each artistic performance was short and dynamic, full of revolutionary fighting spirit, expressing the boundless love and respect of the revolutionary people of all countries for Chairman Mao.

	The performances went on one after another. As soon as one performance ended, the announcer hadn't even had time to announce the next item, when a Malaysian friend eagerly walked onto the stage and began to sing in a loud voice: “East is red, the sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong…” Then he sang, “Sailing the seas relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, dew nourishes the seedlings, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought…” At this moment, enthusiastic applause and shouts of “Long live Chairman Mao!” filled the air.

	The Malaysian friend on stage sang one song after another, as if he would never stop. Finally, the several hundred foreign friends in the audience stood up excitedly from their seats and sang together with the Malaysian friend on stage! The singing was powerful and resonant, rising and falling like waves, filling the entire sailors' club, echoing along the coast of the East China Sea, spreading to the five continents and four seas…

	“Beijing Has a Golden Sun”
	One morning with calm seas, I was on the deck when about a dozen Malaysian sailors approached me and surrounded me, asking me to teach them the song “Beijing Has a Golden Sun.” One of the younger sailors, looking at the rising red sun and holding up a red “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” said with deep emotion: “Mao Zedong, the red sun, the sun is Mao Zedong, Chairman Mao is in my heart!”

	I was moved by the deep affection these sailors had for Chairman Mao and agreed to their sincere request, teaching them the song over and over again. They finally learned to sing “Beijing Has a Golden Sun” in Chinese. They were so happy that they sang and danced, repeatedly shouting: “The sun is Chairman Mao, the sun is Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!”

	“Sailing the Seas Relies on the Helmsman”
	The song “Sailing the Seas Relies on the Helmsman,” which praises Chairman Mao and the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, is not only loved by our people but also by friends from all over the world.

	All the crew members on a Greek ship know how to sing this song. The sailors sing it while scrubbing the deck, during storms at sea, before boarding the ship, and when disembarking. It can be said that wherever they go, they sing “Sailing the Seas Relies on the Helmsman.” Even more touching is that every day before meals, they gather in front of the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao and sing “Sailing the Seas Relies on the Helmsman” in unison.

    歌颂红太阳
    “东方红，太阳升”
    去年国庆节前夕的一个晚上，海员俱乐部里灯火辉煌，歌声嘹亮。这是来自各国的海员朋友们在和我们一块联欢，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年。
    晚会开得很热闹。每个文艺节目都短小精悍、生动活泼，充满了革命的战斗豪情，表达了各国革命人民对毛主席的无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情。
    节目在一个接一个地进行着。一个节目刚结束，报幕员还没有来得及报告下一个节目，这时就见一位马来亚朋友兴冲冲地走上舞台，放声歌唱起来：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”接着又唱“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想……”这时，热烈的掌声和“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声响成一片。
    台上那位马来亚朋友唱了一支又一支，就好象要永远唱下去一样。最后，台下几百位外国朋友都激动地从座位上站了起来，和台上那位马来亚朋友一同唱起来！歌声雄壮有力，此起彼伏，象一浪高过一浪的波涛，充满了整个海员俱乐部，响彻东海之滨的上空，向五洲四海传开去……
    《北京有个金太阳》
    一个风平浪静的早晨，我正在甲板上，迎面来了十几名马来亚海员，一到跟前就把我围了起来，要我教他们唱《北京有个金太阳》这首歌，其中一位比较年青的海员望着冉冉升起的红太阳，手举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，无限深情地说：“毛泽东啊，红太阳，太阳就是毛泽东，毛主席就在我心中！”
    我被这些海员们无限热爱毛主席的深厚感情所激动，答应了他们的恳切要求，一遍一遍地教起来。他们终于学会了用中国话唱《北京有个金太阳》了。他们高兴得连唱带跳地不断高呼：“太阳就是毛主席，太阳就是毛主席！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
    《大海航行靠舵手》
    《大海航行靠舵手》这首歌颂毛主席和光辉的毛泽东思想的歌曲，不但我国人民爱唱，而且世界各国朋友也爱唱。
    一艘希腊船上的全体船员都会唱这首歌曲。海员们在擦甲板时唱，在航海途中遇到狂风恶浪时唱，上船前唱，下船时也唱。可以说，走到哪里就把《大海航行靠舵手》的歌子唱到哪里。更令人感动的是，他们每天在开饭前都要在我们伟大领袖毛主席像前，集体歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
