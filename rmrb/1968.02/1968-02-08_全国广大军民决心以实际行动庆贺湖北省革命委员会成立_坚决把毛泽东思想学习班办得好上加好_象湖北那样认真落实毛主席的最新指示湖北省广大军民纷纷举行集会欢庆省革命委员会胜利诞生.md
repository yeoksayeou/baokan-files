The nation's broad masses of military and civilians are determined to celebrate the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee with practical actions. They resolutely vow to make the Mao Zedong Thought study classes even better. They will, like Hubei, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The broad masses of military and civilians in Hubei are holding rallies to celebrate the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 7th, the great plan of the ten thousand li Yangtze River has begun! The Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory! The billion revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers and officers across the country have just celebrated the glorious establishment of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They joyfully heard the victory song of Mao Zedong Thought from the banks of the Yangtze River, and they all felt a double joy, enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" from the bottom of their hearts. The military and civilians in various places expressed that they must take the Hubei proletarian revolutionaries as an example. No matter in what situation, they must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and unswervingly follow the revolutionary course opened by the great helmsman Mao Zedong. In the great waves of class struggle, they will bravely advance to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The news reached Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Shandong, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that have already established revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory groups. These revolutionary committees or preparatory groups immediately sent congratulatory telegrams, warmly congratulating the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. These telegrams pointed out that the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a brilliant achievement of fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. It will undoubtedly have a tremendous promoting effect on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Yangtze River region and the central and southern regions. Shijiazhuang City in Hebei Province, which has just established a provincial revolutionary committee, held a celebration rally for the establishment of the Hubei Revolutionary Committee on the evening of the 7th. Comrade Wang Guozhan, a standing committee member of the provincial revolutionary committee, said in his speech at the rally that the brilliant achievements of the comrades in Hubei in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a great encouragement to the 43 million people of Hebei. We must learn from the example of the Hubei proletarian revolutionaries and, together with the revolutionary people of the whole country, strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in various places, while rejoicing in the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, expressed that they would follow Chairman Mao's teachings, hold more and better study classes of various types, and, like the proletarian revolutionaries and PLA soldiers and officers in Hubei, grasp the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a standing committee meeting amid the joyous shouts celebrating the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Comrade Jue Xuegang, the head of the revolutionary committee, said at the meeting that in the next phase, a greater wave of holding study classes should be launched to overthrow factionalism and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In Anhui Province, more and more units that have achieved revolutionary great unity and established revolutionary committees through holding large-scale study classes. The responsible person of the preparatory committee for great unity in the Hefei area said, "We must learn from the comrades in Hubei, honestly listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to further promote revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination."

The responsible persons of the revolutionary workers' rebel command of Shandong Province, the workers' congress of Lanzhou area, and the preparatory committee of the workers' congress of Changsha City today heard the good news from Hubei and were all excited to talk about the great situation brought about by holding large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The responsible persons of these workers' revolutionary mass organizations all expressed that they must make the Mao Zedong Thought study classes even better and strive to be models in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee have already entered the third session. The comrades studying here were very excited to hear the news from Hubei. They decided to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary people and the garrison troops in Hubei Province, to engrave Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their hearts, and to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions to unify thoughts, unify the organization, and unify actions. The revolutionary masses in many places such as Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, and Ningxia also expressed that they would vigorously hold study classes and, like the revolutionary people in Hubei, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The news reached the Xinjiang Cement Factory, and the workers of the two revolutionary mass organizations shouted in unison to celebrate Hubei's victory. They expressed their determination to truly hold the Mao Zedong Thought study classes jointly established by the two revolutionary mass organizations, to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, to accelerate the realization of the great unity of the whole factory, and to make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Xinjiang.

Inspired by the news of the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, many regions and grassroots units that have achieved the three-in-one combination expressed their determination to grasp the revolutionization of the leading cadre group to ensure the continuous consolidation and development of the proletarian revolutionary power, and to forever advance under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The responsible comrades of the Hangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee excitedly said, "While celebrating the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, we must learn from them and, like them, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and do a good job in the revolutionization of thoughts." The students of the study class held by the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a discussion after hearing the news. They expressed that they would learn from the good experiences of Hubei Province, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and continuously promote the revolutionization of the leading cadre group and the broad masses, making the whole province of Qinghai a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Many revolutionary workers and cadres in various regions, while celebrating the glorious birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, also expressed that they would further implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao, and seize the double victory of revolution and production. The revolutionary situation in the Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi is currently very good, and coal production is increasing step by step. All revolutionary workers in the mine expressed that they would further boost their spirits and continue to make efforts, producing more coal to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction in various parts of the country. The revolutionary workers in more than ten factories, including the Dawn Electronic Tube Factory in Changsha, are currently holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes to eliminate factionalism in order to better grasp revolution and promote production. They are determined to unite and cooperate with each other to be models in grasping revolution and promoting production.

The broad masses of PLA soldiers and officers held celebration rallies today to warmly congratulate the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The broad masses of soldiers and officers expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, humbly learn from the revolutionary people and garrison troops in Hubei, and do the "three supports" and "two militaries" work even better. In the Pan Mountain County of Liaoning Province, the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought of a certain unit held a discussion with the revolutionary masses at the construction site of the Shuangtaizi River sluice. The soldiers and officers said: "We must, like the garrison troops in Hubei, resolutely implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, patiently help the revolutionary masses enhance proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and develop and consolidate revolutionary great unity." The "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people," the People's Armed Forces Department of Zizhong City, the unit where Liu Yingjun was previously stationed, and the broad masses of soldiers and officers in Lanzhou, Hangzhou, Taiyuan, Hefei, and other places expressed in the celebration activities that they would help the revolutionary masses hold and hold well the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, send Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every corner, and implement them in the hearts of the people, making new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on the 7th, in recent days, from the foothills of the Dabie Mountains to the banks of the Yangtze River, from the mountainous areas of western Hubei to the Jianghan Plain, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses in various parts of Hubei held grand rallies to warmly celebrate the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The broad revolutionary masses, with deep class feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" over and over again, and wished Chairman Mao a long life with all their hearts! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

On this joyous day, the 32 million heroic sons and daughters of Hubei expressed that they must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continue to advance, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

In the factories that Chairman Mao has inspected, such as the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, the Daye Iron Mine, and the Hubei Steel Plant, the broad revolutionary workers pointed out with great excitement that the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a battle achievement of the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in the province under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed that they must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production," grasp revolution, and vigorously promote production, and celebrate the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee with the actual actions of seizing the double harvest of revolution and production. The revolutionary committee of the Hubei Steel Plant held a full meeting on the day the provincial revolutionary committee was established, seriously summarized the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the previous period, and decided to make the Mao Zedong Thought study classes of various types even better and further grasp the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in Hubei, while celebrating the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee, sang affectionately over and over again: "The party's favor is greater than the sky and the earth, and the love of parents is not as great as Chairman Mao's." Chairman Mao issued the great call "to strive for the victory of the Jingjiang flood diversion project for the interests of the broad masses of the people" fifteen years ago. The completion of the Jingjiang flood diversion project has greatly reduced the flood disasters in the Jingzhou area on both banks of the Yangtze River. At this happy moment of celebrating victory, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the Jingzhou area expressed with great excitement that they would resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the brilliant and dazzling year of 1968, and seize an even greater harvest in agricultural production this year.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." All the members of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee resolutely expressed that they must continue to grasp the key of holding and holding well the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously promote the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
