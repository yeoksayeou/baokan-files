Chairman Nguyen Van Hieu of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China met on February 24 with Secretary-General Khadra Dhu of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association and members of the Secretariat. He pointed out that the brilliant victory of the South Vietnamese military and people in the Tet Offensive is inseparable from the support and encouragement of the people of the world. He said, the U.S. imperialists are in their death throes, and the Vietnamese people clearly understand that the struggle ahead will be fierce and arduous. He declared: Unless the U.S. imperialist aggressors accept the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the Vietnamese people will definitely continue the struggle until they achieve final victory.

Nguyen Van Hieu and Khadra Dhu, along with members of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, had a cordial conversation. Khadra Dhu extended warm congratulations to the people of South Vietnam on their Tet Offensive victory. He pointed out that this victory has greatly encouraged the struggle of the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. It has proven that although Vietnam is a small country with a small population, relying on the mighty power of people's war, it can deal a heavy blow to the world's largest imperialism and defeat them.

Khadra Dhu stated: The Afro-Asian Journalists Association will, as always, continue to exert its utmost efforts to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and firmly believes that the heroic Vietnamese people will definitely achieve final victory.
