The brigade leader of the Fifth Brigade in Yong'an is named Yang Naishan. One day, someone suddenly called him "Yang Er" (Old Yang), leaving him bewildered. Yang Naishan went to the brigade office to investigate and found that a big-character poster written by the community members read: "You, Yang Naishan, are like a blind bear standing at attention—one hand covering the sky. You don't trust the masses but only believe in yourself. Heaven is the greatest, and you are the second greatest." From then on, the nickname "Yang Er" spread. Yang Naishan was furious, thinking, "I've worked hard for eight or nine years, even if I have no merits, I have my share of hardships. How can they treat me like this! Let whoever has the ability do it!" In a fit of anger, he quit his job. Seeing Yang Naishan's situation, the community members tried to encourage him by recalling past hardships and sweet moments, urging him to stand tall and continue working. But he always felt like there was a lock on his heart, making him unhappy. This all happened last spring. Before long, winter arrived, the fields were harvested, and the grain was delivered. Old Yang planned to tidy up and hand over his duties.

After the study class began, the issue of cadre-mass relations was discussed, and Old Yang started to list all the difficulties he faced as a brigade leader. He talked about how it was hard to be in charge, facing problems from all sides. The propaganda team members, addressing the thoughts exposed in the study class, promptly provided everyone with ideological weapons: "We have always advocated that the revolution relies on the masses, everyone should participate, and we oppose relying only on a few people to issue orders." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, everyone discussed their insights and deeply examined the root causes of their thoughts. Yang Naishan's thoughts underwent intense struggle. At this time, the propaganda team members gave him two more quotations from Chairman Mao: "The masses are the real heroes," and "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most capable people are those with the most practical experience." Chairman Mao's words made Old Yang's heart increasingly clear. He deeply felt that his past mistakes were due to not following Chairman Mao's teachings, confusing the positions of the masses and the individual. He often adopted an attitude of "I say, you listen," and when people didn't listen, he would scold them. Ultimately, it was because there was a "self" in his mind, and he couldn't see the masses.

The golden key of Mao Zedong Thought unlocked the lock on Yang Naishan's heart. Previously, when he assigned work to the community members, he always had an official accompany them, ostensibly leading but actually supervising the community members' work. The brigade needed six people to weave mats, but Yang Naishan insisted on adding another official. After studying, Old Yang immediately went to the weaving group, studied Chairman Mao's quotations with everyone, explained the significance of this work, and checked his past mistakes of not trusting the masses. He also withdrew the official. This greatly stimulated the community members' enthusiasm, improving the quality of the mats and increasing the speed by thirty percent. Following Chairman Mao's teachings on criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism, Yang Naishan six times openly discussed his selfish thoughts and shared his insights at community meetings. Everyone praised him, saying: "Old Yang truly learned a lot in the study class. Now, his heart is truly close to ours."

    金钥匙打开了老杨心上的锁
    永安大队五队长名叫杨乃山，可是有一天忽然有人喊开他“杨老二”了，叫得他摸不着头脑。杨乃山到队部一看，原来社员给他贴的一张大字报上写道：“你杨乃山是熊瞎子打立正——一手遮天。不相信群众只相信自己，天是老大，你是老二。”从此，“杨老二”这个绰号就传开了。杨乃山心里窝了一肚子火，心想，我辛辛苦苦干了八九年，没功劳也有苦劳，哪能这样整我！谁有能耐谁干吧！一气之下，把挑子撂了。看到杨乃山这种情况，社员们就找他忆苦思甜，鼓励他挺起腰杆来继续干。但他心里总象锁了把锁似的不痛快。这些都是去年春上的事了。转眼间，冬天到了，场打光了，粮送完了，老杨打算拾掇拾掇就交班。
    学习班开课以后，干群关系问题一展开讨论，老杨就把当队长的难处一串一串地掂了出来。什么前后不是，左右逢难，反正是队长这差事难当。宣传队的同志针对学习班上暴露出来的活思想，及时给大家送来了思想武器：“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”大家根据毛主席的教导，畅谈了体会，狠挖了思想根源。杨乃山的思想激烈斗争起来了。这时，宣传队的同志又给他送了两条毛主席语录：“群众是真正的英雄”，“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”毛主席的话，使老杨心里越来越开朗。他深有感触地说，过去错就错在没按毛主席的教导去办，把群众与个人的位置弄错了。动不动就摆出我说你听的架势，人家不听就叮当五六地训一顿。归根到底还是脑袋里有“私”字，眼里看不到群众。
    毛泽东思想的金钥匙打开了杨乃山心上的锁。以前他给社员分配活，总要派上一个干部跟着，表面是领着干，实际是看着社员干。队里编帘子六个人就挺合适，可杨乃山偏要再插进去个干部。经过学习，老杨马上到编帘子组，和大家一块学习了毛主席语录，讲清了这项工作的意义，同时检查了自己以前不相信群众的错误，把那个干部也抽出来了。这样，大大地激发了社员的积极性，帘子的质量提高了，速度也加快了百分之三十。杨乃山按照毛主席关于要斗私，批修的教导，连续六次在社员会上亮私心谈体会。大家夸他说：老杨在学习班里真学出了名堂，现在跟咱的心贴得可紧了。
