In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist troops, the working class of Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, has further achieved revolutionary unity. On February 10, the Nanjing Workers' Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee was officially established. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and another bountiful harvest in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions!

In the afternoon of the 10th, more than ten million revolutionary workers and masses of Nanjing, carrying the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," held a grand rally to celebrate the establishment of the Nanjing Workers' Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee. The venue was filled with red flags, and cheers echoed like thunder, creating a revolutionary atmosphere of unity and joy. The revolutionary masses repeatedly shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Nanjing City established the Workers' Revolutionary Great Alliance Preparatory Committee in December last year, promoting revolutionary unity from top to bottom in many grassroots units, creating the conditions for the establishment of the Nanjing Workers' Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee. The representative of the Workers' Revolutionary Great Alliance Preparatory Committee reported on the work of the previous stage at the meeting. He hoped that after the establishment of the Workers' Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee, it would better fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and further consolidate and develop the revolutionary unity of the working class.

Comrade Zhou Guanwu, Deputy Political Commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, and Comrade Peng Bo, responsible for the leftist troops, spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating the establishment of the Nanjing Workers' Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee. Comrade Zhou Guanwu said, "The workers of Nanjing have achieved revolutionary unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, setting an example for the revolutionary masses of the whole province." Comrade Zhou Guanwu hoped that everyone would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, redouble their efforts, strive for the forefront, and continue to work hard. He hoped that everyone would unite as one, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, creating new achievements!

Representatives from the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Nanjing suburbs and representatives from the revolutionary masses of Nanjing University spoke at the meeting. They expressed their determination to learn from the working class, further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity on all fronts, and create conditions for the early establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

The meeting, amidst thunderous applause, passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. The meeting also read the call to the revolutionary workers of Nanjing by the Nanjing Workers' Revolutionary Great Alliance Committee. After the meeting, a grand parade was held to celebrate the occasion.

    南京郊区贫下中农代表，南京大学无产阶级革命派代表，分别在大会上发言。他们表示要向工人阶级学习，进一步巩固和发展各条战线的革命大联合，为早日建立江苏省革命委员会创造条件。
    大会在雷鸣般的掌声中，通过了给最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。会上还宣读了南京工人革命大联合委员会给南京市革命工人的号召书。会后举行了盛大的庆祝游行。
