The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch in Shanyang County, Shanxi Province, has achieved remarkable results and accumulated rich experience in leading the poor and lower-middle peasants and all the brigade members in the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They have adhered to the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, emphasizing the combination of learning and application, and have achieved outstanding results in promoting the thought revolution of the people.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The problem of study style is a problem of the thinking method of the leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members. It is a problem of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. It is a problem of the working attitude of all Party comrades. Since this is the case, the problem of study style is a very important problem, it is the first important problem." "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch has followed the teachings of Chairman Mao and the relevant instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao. For many years, they have led the poor and lower-middle peasants and all the brigade members to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, insisting on the combination of learning and application, and have achieved outstanding results in promoting the thought revolution of the people. The common oath of the poor peasants in Dazhai is: "Study one sentence of Chairman Mao's quotations, understand the spiritual essence well, compare it with problems when encountering them, and use it for a lifetime without forgetting it." Because they have carried forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao and truly used Mao Zedong Thought to guide their thoughts and actions, they have created great achievements in class struggle and production struggle and have become a red banner on China's agricultural front.

	1. Always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the serious problem is educating the peasants," and regard the task of using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the peasants' worldview and cultivate the first generation of new-type peasants in the world as the fundamental task of the rural Party branch.

In many years of struggle and practice, the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch has always regarded completing this most fundamental task as being above everything, greater than everything, preceding everything, and heavier than everything in "basic construction." They believe that for more than a decade, from the nation to Dazhai, class struggle has never stopped. The class enemies have tried every means to seize the leadership in the countryside from the proletariat, first seizing the leadership in the minds of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Using Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the ideological positions of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants will firmly grasp the leadership of the proletariat in the countryside. The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch has started from this understanding and regarded using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants as the fundamental guarantee for "not allowing the old exploiting class to restore power, not allowing a new exploiting class to emerge, not allowing the collective economy to lose its direction, not allowing the poor and lower-middle peasants to degenerate, and not allowing the proletarian state to change color."

	2. Intensify class education to cultivate a deep class sentiment of loving and being loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch believes that Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest ideological weapon for the proletariat to carry out class struggle. To master this ideological weapon, the most fundamental thing is to have a deep class sentiment for Mao Zedong Thought. Only by cultivating a deep class sentiment of loving and being loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought can one study and apply Chairman Mao's books better and better, and truly establish a proletarian revolutionary learning style. The Party Branch often carries out "three remembrances and three comparisons" class education among the community members, which are: remembering the bitterness of class oppression and national oppression in the past, and comparing it with the liberation and happiness of the laboring people today; remembering the class struggles and the tortuous path that Dazhai has experienced over the past decade, and comparing it with the development and prosperity of the collective economy today; remembering the complex struggles experienced in the transformation of personal thoughts, and comparing it with personal growth and progress. The Party Branch has also set up an "educational ditch" and "educational field" to reflect the contrast between old and new Dazhai, and has set up a village history exhibition. They have also designated the place under the big willow tree where the landlords and rich peasants used to beat the poor peasants in the old society as a classroom for regular class education. In the process of class education, the Party Branch guides everyone to remember the source of water and deeply understand that all the achievements of Dazhai today are the victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have an even deeper love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "Mao Zedong Thought is the treasure among treasures, generation after generation cannot do without it." From the elderly over seventy or eighty years old to the children in kindergarten, everyone is striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

	3. Cadres must set an example, which is the key to establishing a proletarian revolutionary learning style.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch believes that leading the way in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, being both an organizer and a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, is what constitutes a proletarian leader. In the Dazhai Brigade, Party Branch Secretary Chen Yonggui is the model for the entire brigade in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Everyone says he has no personal gain, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and does everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Now, he and a group of poor and lower-middle peasants with rich experience in class struggle and enthusiastic about studying Chairman Mao's works have organized a study group for Chairman Mao's works. This group studies ahead and applies ahead. The masses call this group the "vanguard group" of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They say, "The vanguard group studies ahead and sets a good example for us, and we should follow their example."

The cadres of the Dazhai Brigade study and apply what they learn in two aspects. One is reflected in their personal style of work. The cadres of the Dazhai Brigade have followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses" and "all our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people" for many years, diligently serving the community members. Except for the accountant, no one else has received any additional work points. Whatever the brigade distributes, the cadres always give the best to the community members, and the cadres and Party members have never enjoyed any special privileges. The other is reflected in the work of the cadres. After learning Chairman Mao's teaching of "our policy must be based on our own strength, which means self-reliance," the cadres of the Dazhai Brigade have insisted on implementing this instruction for many years. Even in the year 1963 when they suffered severe rain and flood disasters, they still firmly relied on the creativity of the broad masses to restore and develop production, insisting on "three nos": no money from the state, no grain from the state, and no materials from the state. They returned the relief funds and materials sent by the state four times, suggesting that the state should rescue the brigades that are more in need than Dazhai.

	4. Intensify the struggle against selfishness and guide the peasants to establish the idea of learning for the public and using for the revolution.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch believes that in studying Chairman Mao's works, the "use" and "public" are connected. Only by overthrowing selfishness can one establish the idea of the public; only by establishing the idea of the public can one use it well and flexibly. The biggest obstacle to learning and not using is selfishness. Therefore, the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch has always regarded selfishness as the main enemy in leading the peasants to establish a proletarian revolutionary learning style and has done a lot of detailed ideological and political work to help the community members consciously struggle against selfishness.

There was a community member named Zhao Xiaohao who originally had a lot of selfishness. Chen Yonggui told him the story of Norman Bethune. Once, he and Chen Yonggui went out to buy four cows, and he drove them back alone. On the way, he encountered a cow running down from the mountain, so he drove the cow back together with someone else's. He said, "This is good for our collective." Chen Yonggui knew about it and struggled against selfishness with him. Chen Yonggui said to Zhao Xiaohao, "Our collective is a collective, and someone else's collective is also a collective. To love our collective, we must first love someone else's collective and cannot take someone else's oil to fatten ourselves. Harming others for personal gain is not true collectivism!" Zhao Xiaohao knew he was wrong and returned the cow to its owner, but his selfishness had not been completely eliminated. Another time, he went to the county to pull steel, and he pulled back an extra one. He said, "I pulled back an extra steel bar, which is still for the community members to make more farming tools, this is for everyone's good." Chen Yonggui knew about it and struggled against selfishness with him again. Chen Yonggui said, "You must love the collective, and first, you must love the country. The country is a big collective, and our collective is a small collective. To love our collective, we must first love the country, this big collective." Zhao Xiaohao realized his mistake again and returned the steel bar. Under the patient help of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, following Mao Zedong Thought to constantly overcome selfishness and establish the public, Zhao Xiaohao finally grew into a good community member who "serves the public with all his heart." In 1964, he dedicated his life to building the new Dazhai. After his death, he was posthumously recognized as an active member of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a member of the Communist Party of China.

	5. Establish models of studying and applying, set the style of studying and applying, and make everyone proud to study and apply, and ashamed to study and not apply.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch believes that to establish a revolutionary learning style, one must establish a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and focus on the "use." Old hero Jia Jincai studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "firmly deciding, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and went to Jin Shipo to break stones in wind and snow to build the new Dazhai. His hands were frozen and cracked, but he never complained, and his hands never left the hammer. He studied and applied Chairman Mao's instructions most resolutely, using one sentence and applying it firmly, every day, every month, and every year. The Dazhai Brigade established him as the model for the entire brigade in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. There are ten such models in the Dazhai Brigade. This points out the direction of effort for the entire brigade and establishes a living model.

	6. Precise learning content and "three combinations" organizational form.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch organizes the community to study Chairman Mao's works, mainly studying the "Old Five Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They regard the images of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the Old Fool as models for establishing a proletarian worldview. They must use the two rulers of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people every day, use the two mirrors of being extremely responsible for work and extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people every day, and use the broom of criticism and self-criticism to sweep away the dust in their minds every day.

In the process of learning, they adopt the method of combining cadres and community members, combining young and old, and combining those with and without education to form groups. The advantage of this is: cadres and community members work and study together, transform their worldviews together, and cadres can better understand the community members, discover various problems, and solve them in a timely manner. Young people have education, can read and write, but lack experience in class struggle and production struggle. Young people and old people are mixed in groups to study and apply Chairman Mao's works together, which can help each other, make up for each other's shortcomings, and promote the thought revolution together.

    大寨大队党支部怎样领导社员活学活用毛主席著作？
    狠抓阶级教育树立革命好学风干部学在前用在前带头做榜样
    据新华社太原十二日电　山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队党支部，在领导贫下中农和全队社员开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动中，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，取得了卓越的成就，积累了丰富的经验。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”大寨大队党支部，遵循毛主席的教导和林彪副主席的有关指示，多年来领导大队贫下中农和全体社员认真地活学活用毛主席著作，坚持学用结合，在促进人的思想革命化上取得了卓越的成就。大寨贫下中农的共同誓言是：“毛主席语录学一条，精神实质领会好，遇到问题就对照，用一辈子忘不了。”正因为他们发扬了毛主席倡导的革命学风，真正做到了用毛泽东思想统帅自己的思想和行动，才在阶级斗争和生产斗争中创造出伟大的业绩，成为我国农业战线上的一面红旗。
     （一）要时时刻刻牢记毛主席“严重的问题是教育农民”这一伟大教导，把坚持用毛泽东思想改造农民的世界观，培养世界上第一代新型的农民，作为农村党支部的根本任务。
    在多年的斗争实践中，大寨大队党支部一直把完成好这样一条最根本的任务，看作是高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的“基本建设”。他们认为，十几年来，从全国到大寨，阶级斗争一天也没有停止过。阶级敌人千方百计妄想在农村从无产阶级手里夺取领导权，首先要夺贫下中农头脑里的领导权。用毛泽东思想去占领广大贫下中农的思想阵地，就会最牢固地掌住无产阶级在农村的领导权。大寨大队党支部就是从这样的认识出发，把用毛泽东思想武装广大贫下中农，当作是“不让旧的剥削阶级复辟，不让新的剥削阶级产生，不让集体经济迷失方向，不让贫下中农变质，不让无产阶级江山变色”的根本保证。
    （二）狠抓阶级教育，把无限热爱、无限忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想的阶级感情搞得浓浓的。
    大寨大队党支部认为，毛泽东思想是无产阶级进行阶级斗争的最锐利的思想武器，要掌握起这个思想武器，最根本的一条就是要对毛泽东思想充满深厚阶级感情。只有把对毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限忠诚的阶级感情搞得浓浓的，才能对毛主席的书越学越爱学，才能学得好，用得好，才能真正树立起无产阶级的革命学风。党支部在社员群众中经常开展“三忆、三看”的阶级教育，这就是：忆过去阶级压迫、民族压迫的苦，看今天劳动人民的翻身解放和幸福生活；忆大寨十几年所经历的阶级斗争和所走过的曲折路程，看今天集体经济的发展壮大和欣欣向荣；忆个人思想改造所经历的复杂斗争，看个人的成长进步。党支部为了对社员进行阶级教育，还留了反映新旧大寨对比的“教育沟”、“教育田”，搞了村史展览，并且把旧社会地主、富农吊打贫下中农的大柳树下那块地方，作为进行经常性阶级教育的课堂。在进行阶级教育的过程中，党支部引导大家饮水思源，使大家深刻地认识到大寨今天的一切成就都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。因此，广大贫下中农对毛主席和毛泽东思想更加无限热爱、无限忠诚。他们说：“毛泽东思想是宝中宝，祖祖辈辈离不了。”上至七八十岁的老人，下至幼儿园的小娃娃，都在那里努力活学活用毛主席著作。
    （三）干部必须带头做出样子，这是树立无产阶级革命学风的关键。
    大寨大队党支部认为，带头活学活用毛主席著作，既当活学活用毛主席著作的组织者，又当活学活用毛主席著作的模范，这才算得上是无产阶级的领导。在大寨大队，党支部书记陈永贵同志是全大队活学活用毛主席著作的榜样。大家说他没有一点私心，无限忠于毛主席，不管办什么事，都遵照毛主席的指示去做。现在，他和一部分阶级斗争经验丰富、学习毛主席著作积极热情的贫下中农一起，组织了一个学习毛主席著作小组，这个小组学在前边，用在前边。群众称这个小组是活学活用毛主席著作的“尖子组”。他们说，“尖子组”学在前面，给我们树立了一个好样子，我们也要照他们那样做。
    大寨大队的干部学了就用，表现在两个方面。一个是表现在本人的思想作风方面。大寨大队的干部学了毛主席的“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”和“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，多年来勤勤恳恳为社员服务，除会计以外，其他人都没有拿过补贴工分。队里分什么东西，干部也都是先把好的分给社员，干部和党员从来不搞特殊化。另一个是表现在干部的工作方面。大寨大队的干部学了毛主席“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生”的教导以后，多年来坚决贯彻这一指示，即使在遭到严重的暴雨、洪水灾害的一九六三年，仍然坚定地依靠广大群众的创造力来恢复和发展生产，坚持“三不要”，不要国家的钱，不要国家的粮，不要国家的物资。他们四次把国家送来的救济款和物资送回去，建议国家去救济那些比大寨更需要的兄弟大队。
    （四）狠斗“私”字，引导农民树立为公而学，为革命而用的思想。
    大寨大队党支部认为，在学习毛主席著作中，“用”字和“公”字是连在一起的。斗倒“私”字，才能树立“公”字；树立了“公”字，才能用得好，用得活。学了不用，最大的障碍就是“私”字作怪。因此，大寨大队党支部在领导农民树立无产阶级的革命学风中，一直把“私”字当成主要的敌人，帮助社员群众自觉地斗私，长期以来他们在这方面做了大量的细致的思想政治工作。
    有个社员叫赵小和，原来私心较重。陈永贵同志就给他讲白求恩的故事。一次，他和陈永贵同志外出买了四头牛，自己一个人往回赶，路上碰到山上跑下一头牛来，他就把人家的一头牛也一起赶了回来。他说：“这是为咱集体好。”陈永贵同志知道了，就和他一起斗私。陈永贵同志对赵小和说：“我们的集体是个集体，人家的集体也是个集体，要热爱自己的集体，首先要热爱别人的集体，不能把别人的油水捞过来肥自己。损人利己，不是真正的集体主义！”赵小和知道错了，就把那头牛给人家送了回去，但是他的私心还没有去根。另一次，他到县里拉钢材，又多拉了一根回来。他说：“我多拉回一根钢材，还不是为社员多打些农具，这是为大家好。”陈永贵同志知道了，又和他一起斗私。陈永贵同志说：“你要热爱集体，首先要热爱自己的国家。国家是个大集体，我们的集体是个小集体，要热爱自己的集体，首先要热爱国家这个大集体。”赵小和再一次认识到自己错了，又把那根钢材给送了回去。在大寨大队党支部的耐心帮助下，按照毛泽东思想不断破私立公，赵小和终于成长为一名“一心为公”的好社员，在一九六四年为建设新大寨献出了自己的生命。他死后，被追认为活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子和中国共产党党员。
    （五）树活学活用的标兵，立活学活用的风尚，使大家以学了就用为荣，以学了不用为耻。
    大寨大队党支部认为，要树立革命学风，就要树立活学活用毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫的样板。老英雄贾进才学习了毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这一教导，为建设新大寨风雪无阻地到金石坡去开石头，手冻开了裂缝，他没有叫过一声苦，手没有离开过铁锤。他学习毛主席的指示，用得最坚决，学一条就用一条，天天用，月月用，年年用。大寨大队就把他树为全大队活学活用毛主席著作的标兵。象这样的标兵在大寨大队一共树了十人。这就给全大队指明了努力的方向，树立了活的样板。
    （六）少而精的学习内容，“三结合”的组织形式。
    大寨大队党支部组织群众学习毛主席著作，主要是学“老五篇”和毛主席的最新指示。他们把张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个英雄形象，当作树立无产阶级世界观的榜样。要用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务两把尺子天天量，要用对工作极端负责任，对同志对人民极端热忱两面镜子天天照，要用批评与自我批评这把扫帚天天扫除思想上的灰尘。
    在学习中，他们采取干部和社员结合，青年和老年结合，有文化和没文化的人结合的办法编组。这样的好处是：干部和社员在一起劳动和学习，在一起改造世界观，干部可以更好地了解社员，发现各种问题，及时解决。青年人有文化，会读会写，但是缺乏阶级斗争和生产斗争的经验。青年人和老年人混合编组，在一起活学活用毛主席著作，可以互相帮助，取长补短，共同促进思想革命化。
