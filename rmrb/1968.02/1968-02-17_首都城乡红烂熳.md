The spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought is blowing across the capital's city and countryside. Revolutionary committees have been established in all 18 districts and counties of Beijing. This is a bountiful harvest of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

The establishment of revolutionary committees in Beijing's districts and counties has fundamentally shattered the dream of China's Khrushchev and his agent Peng Zhen's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique to turn Beijing into a base for restoring capitalism. The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee now stands on an even more solid foundation, possessing even greater proletarian revolutionary authority. This has great significance for defending Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao; it will have a major impact on seizing the comprehensive victory of the nationwide Cultural Revolution.

The important task facing provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that have already established revolutionary committees is to promote the establishment of revolutionary "three-in-one" power organs at all subordinate levels. Once revolutionary committees are established at all levels, with a leadership team that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, things will be much easier. The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, in the midst of the stormy class struggle, resolutely implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and focuses on establishing new leadership teams in each district and county. By addressing this issue, Chairman Mao's latest instructions can be quickly implemented at the grassroots level, and the broad revolutionary masses can be more fully and effectively mobilized and organized to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." Currently, the main forms of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie factionalism and anarchist tendencies are the main weapons used by the bourgeoisie to attack the proletariat and by class enemies to sabotage the Cultural Revolution. The rapid development of the Cultural Revolution in Beijing has proven: holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, especially joint classes by various factions, classes for cadres and masses together, focusing on criticizing and repudiating factionalism and anarchist tendencies of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie, and strengthening proletarian party spirit, is the fundamental way to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve and consolidate revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination.

The victory of the Cultural Revolution in the capital provides valuable experience and sets a brilliant example for other places. Beijing is advancing, and the whole country is advancing. A magnificent scene of a new upsurge in revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination is unfolding before the people of the entire nation.

    首都城乡红烂熳
    本报评论员
    毛泽东思想的春风，吹遍了首都的城乡。北京市十八个区、县革命委员会全部成立了。这是落实毛主席最新指示的丰硕成果，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一新胜利！
    北京各区、县革命委员会的成立，从根本上粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭真反革命修正主义集团妄图把北京市变成复辟资本主义基地的黄粱美梦。北京市革命委员会，从此屹立在更加坚实的基础上，更加具有无产阶级的革命权威。这对保卫毛主席，保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，有着巨大的意义；对夺取全国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，必将产生重大的影响。
    已成立革命委员会的省、市、自治区，面临的一项重要任务，就是促进所属各级建立革命“三结合”的权力机构。各级都成立革命委员会，有一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的领导班子，事情就好办了。北京市革命委员会，在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓建立各区、县新的领导班子的工作。抓住了这个问题，就能使毛主席的每一项最新指示迅速地在基层落实，就能更充分、更有效地调动和组织广大革命群众，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”当前，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的主要形式，是阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的主要“法宝”。北京市无产阶级文化大革命急剧发展的事实证明：大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，特别是各派联合举办，干部与群众一起举办，以斗私批修为纲，狠批资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，大力增强无产阶级党性，发动群众大胆解放干部，是全面落实毛主席最新指示，实现和巩固革命大联合、革命三结合的根本途径。
    首都无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，为各地提供了宝贵的经验，树立了光辉的榜样。北京在前进，全国在前进。一个革命大联合和革命三结合新高涨的壮丽图景，正出现在全国人民的面前。
