Sectarianism and anarchism are two sides of the same coin. Those who engage in sectarianism also engage in anarchism. Both sectarianism and anarchism are reactionary social trends. They are obstacles to fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Therefore, in the "people's war" to eliminate sectarianism, anarchism must also be swept away completely.

Isn't it true? Anarchists do not distinguish between right and wrong. They arrogantly shout, "Liberate thought," "Overthrow slavery," "Dare to rebel!" In their minds, revolutionary authority and organizational discipline are all "old stuff" and must "step aside." The interests of the Party, the state, and the people are all "empty talk" and mere slogans. Revolution, if one wants to do it, do it; if not, don't. Production, if one wants to promote it, promote it; if not, don't. Resuming classes, if one wants to, resume them; if not, don't. No one has the right to interfere. In short, they do what they like and discard what they don't like.

Those who are obsessed with anarchism, do they really want no government? No! The government they want is not a proletarian government, but a "sovereign state" of bourgeois individualism and sectarianism. Although they are sometimes fervent and sometimes carefree, they never deviate from their essence, as Lenin said: "They still stand on the standpoint of the bourgeois worldview."

History is merciless. Anything that goes against the laws of historical development and the will of the people will be resisted by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Now, sectarianism is being eliminated, and anarchism is being rooted out. Their shameful end is inevitable!

### 把派性和无政府主义一起埋葬

专栏：各地报刊评论摘要

    把派性和无政府主义一起埋葬
    派性和无政府主义是一对难兄难弟。闹派性的人，同时也闹无政府主义。派性和无政府主义，都是一种反动的社会思潮。它们是阻碍毛主席最新指示条条落实、全面落实的障碍。所以，在围歼派性的“人民战争”中，也一定要把无政府主义扫除干净。
    不是吗？无政府主义者不分青红皂白，趾高气扬地大喊大叫：“要解放思想”，“要打倒奴隶主义”，“要敢于造反”！在这些人的心目中，什么革命权威，什么组织纪律，全是“老一套”，统统都要“靠边站”。什么党的利益，什么国家的利益，什么人民的利益，全是“空道理”，统统都是口头禅。革命，愿抓就抓，不愿抓就不抓；生产，愿促就促，不愿促就不促；复课，愿复就复，不愿复就不复，谁也无权干涉。总之，合口味的事就干，不合口味的事就甩。
    热衷于无政府主义的人，他们真的不要政府吗？不！他们要的政府不是无产阶级的政府，而是资产阶级个人主义和派性的“独立王国”。尽管它们一会儿狂热，一会儿逍遥，但是千变万变不离其宗，如同列宁所说的那样：“他们还是站在资产阶级世界观的立场上。”
    历史是无情的，任何违反历史发展规律和人民愿望的，都会遭到亿万革命群众的抵制。现在派性正在被歼，无政府主义也在被揪。它们可耻的下场已成定局！
