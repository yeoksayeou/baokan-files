In recent days, the people of our country have watched with great excitement the heroic battles of the military and civilian population of South Vietnam, enthusiastically cheering their magnificent victories.

The heroic military and civilian population of South Vietnam launched a powerful, all-out offensive against the enemy during the Spring Festival, sweeping across the entire South Vietnamese battlefield from the 17th parallel to Cape Ca Mau, delivering a devastating blow to American imperialism and its lackeys. According to the initial battle results published by the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam on February 6, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam, in the six days up to February 4, annihilated over 50,000 enemy troops (including more than 10,000 American invaders), dissolved 200,000 puppet soldiers, destroyed more than 1,500 enemy aircraft, more than 4,000 military vehicles, and sank or destroyed 50 enemy naval vessels. The Vietnamese comrades fought well! The news of victory has brought great joy to the people. We once again extend our warmest congratulations to our heroic Vietnamese comrades.

The new victories of the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation are a brilliant new chapter in the history of the world's revolutionary wars. In this massive offensive, people from all walks of life in the cities and countryside of South Vietnam were widely mobilized, organized, and armed, fighting alongside the People's Liberation Armed Forces to defeat the American invaders, leaving them in disarray and panic. This combination of military and civilian forces, urban and rural areas, and internal and external forces, fully demonstrated the boundless power of people's war, raising the level of the Vietnamese people's war to a new height.

The new victories of the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation are a new triumph of revolutionary heroism. In this fierce battle, the Vietnamese people demonstrated an indomitable will to overcome all difficulties and press forward, a fearless spirit of self-sacrifice and daring, as well as a high degree of organization and discipline, creating countless heart-stopping and moving miracles.

The new victories of the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation have greatly humiliated American imperialism, greatly boosted the morale of the world's revolutionary people, and made a tremendous contribution to the anti-imperialist cause of all peoples. It has set a brilliant example for all oppressed peoples and nations to mobilize and rely on their own people to defeat powerful enemies. The people of our country should seriously learn from the Vietnamese people's unyielding fighting spirit and the revolutionary heroism they demonstrated in battle.

All reactionary forces will not willingly accept their own demise; they will inevitably struggle desperately to the end. After the Vietnamese people's New Year offensive, Johnson immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures, declaring that the United States would not change its "basic strategy" of invading Vietnam and vowing to continue sending more troops to South Vietnam. Currently, the U.S. ruling clique is plotting to conduct a war mobilization at home, calling up reservists and extending the service terms of active-duty personnel, in order to expand the war in Vietnam and prepare to spread the flames of war across the entire Indochina Peninsula. However, no matter how desperately American imperialism struggles, it cannot save itself from total defeat in the Vietnam War and cannot stop the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression from achieving final victory.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said in a telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho: "Persistence is victory. I am deeply convinced that the Vietnamese people, by persisting in a protracted war, will surely drive the American aggressors out of Vietnam."

Today, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression has achieved great victories. Despite the desperate struggles of American imperialism, it will bring various difficulties to the Vietnamese people and make the Vietnamese people face a difficult journey before achieving final victory. However, the Vietnamese people, who have been in a long-term struggle with American imperialism, fully understand from their own struggle practice: Persistence is victory. After the darkness before dawn, a brilliant tomorrow is about to arrive. After overcoming the difficulties of war, the path to victory will soon be open.

In a telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho on February 4, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "The closer to victory, the more difficulties there will be. The enemy, like a cornered beast, will struggle more desperately. Therefore, our military and civilian population must strengthen unity, persist in the fight, strike hard, and strike continuously to achieve greater victories." The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam also called on the 14 million people of South Vietnam to advance bravely under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, deliver a fatal blow to the American puppet clique, and achieve complete victory. The Vietnamese people, who dare to fight and dare to win, will surely respond resolutely to the battle calls of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, unyieldingly and unremittingly, overcoming all difficulties, persisting in a protracted war, and carrying out the great war of resistance against American aggression to the end, completing the sacred cause of national liberation and national reunification.

The American aggressors will be driven out of Vietnam, not a single one left behind! The final victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!

    越南战友，你们打得好！
    本报评论员
    连日来，我国人民怀着无比兴奋的心情，注视着越南南方军民的英勇战斗，热烈欢呼他们取得的辉煌胜利。
    英雄的越南南方军民，在春节期间向敌人发动强大的全面袭击，横扫从十七度线到金瓯角的整个南越战场，给美帝国主义及其走狗以极其沉重的打击。据越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部二月六日公布的初步战果，越南南方军民在到二月四日为止的六天中，共歼灭了敌人五万多名（其中包括美国侵略军一万多名），瓦解伪军二十万名，击毁敌机一千五百多架、军车四千多辆，击沉或击毁敌军舰艇五十艘。越南战友打得好！捷报传来，人心大快。我们再一次向英雄的越南战友表示最热烈的祝贺。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的新胜利，是世界人民革命战争史上一页光辉夺目的新篇章。在这次规模巨大的袭击中，越南南方城乡各阶层人民广泛地动员起来，组织起来，武装起来，配合人民解放武装力量作战，把美国侵略者打得人仰马翻，丧魂失魄。这样军民结合、城乡结合、内外结合，充分地发挥了人民战争的无穷威力，把越南人民战争发展到了一个新的高度水平。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的新胜利，是革命英雄主义的一支新凯歌。在这次激烈的战斗中，越南人民表现了排除万难、勇往直前的坚强意志，不怕牺牲、赴汤蹈火的大无畏精神，以及高度的组织性和纪律性，创造了无数惊心动魄、可歌可泣的奇迹。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的新胜利，大灭了美帝国主义的威风，大长了世界革命人民的志气，为各国人民反帝事业作出了巨大的贡献，给一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族树立了一个动员和依靠本国人民战胜强大敌人的光辉榜样。我国人民要认真学习越南人民坚强不屈的战斗意志，学习他们在战斗中表现出的革命英雄主义精神。
    一切反动势力都不会甘心于自己的灭亡，它们必然要进行疯狂的垂死挣扎。在越南人民新春胜利出击后，约翰逊马上召开紧急会议商量对策，叫嚷美国不会改变侵略越南的“基本战略”，声称要继续向南越增兵。目前，美国统治集团正酝酿在国内进行战争动员，征召预备役人员和延长现役人员服役期限，以便扩大侵越战争，准备把战火烧到整个印度支那。但是，美帝国主义不论怎样疯狂挣扎，也无法挽救它在侵越战争中遭到彻底失败，无法阻挡越南人民的抗美救国战争取得最后胜利。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在给阮友寿主席的贺电中说：“坚持下去就是胜利。我深信，越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。”
    今天，越南人民的抗美救国战争，已经取得了伟大的胜利。尽管美帝国主义的垂死挣扎，还会给越南人民带来这样那样的困难，使越南人民在取得最后胜利之前还要经历一段艰苦的路程，但是，同美帝国主义进行了长期较量的越南人民，从自己的斗争实践中完全懂得：坚持下去就是胜利。度过黎明前的黑暗，光辉的明天即将降临。跨过战争的艰难路程，胜利的坦途就要到来。
    胡志明主席在二月四日给阮友寿主席的贺电中指出：“越接近胜利，困难将会越多。敌人就象一头走投无路的野兽，将更加疯狂地挣扎。因此，我们军民更要加强团结，坚持战斗，狠狠地打，连续地打，以夺取更大的胜利。”越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会也号召一千四百万越南南方人民，在越南南方民族解放阵线旗帜的指引下，奋勇前进，给予美伪集团以致命的打击，夺取彻底胜利。敢于斗争、敢于胜利的越南人民一定会坚决响应胡志明主席和越南南方民族解放阵线的战斗号召，不屈不挠，再接再厉，克服一切困难，坚持持久作战，把伟大的抗美救国战争进行到底，完成民族解放和祖国统一的神圣事业。
    美国侵略者必将一个不剩地从越南滚出去！最后的胜利必将属于英雄的越南人民！
