Be a rock that never weathers on the road

A soldier of the 8733 Unit who is one of the five good soldiers, Hou Chaowen

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought nurtures a generation of communists who are selfless, diligent, self-disciplined, and hardworking. However, the Chinese Khrushchev absurdly says, "If you work hard at this job for a long time, you will eventually get the credit." This is sheer nonsense!

We soldiers of the Engineering Corps listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, love to work hard the most, oppose showing off the most, and understand the harm of showing off the most. When we build roads, we gather many small stones together, forming a solid roadbed and a smooth road. If any stone leaves the roadbed and the collective, and goes to the road surface to "show off" as the Chinese Khrushchev advocates, it will inevitably become a "stumbling block" that hinders people and vehicles. Ultimately, it will either be crushed into powder by the rolling wheels or weathered into dust. We soldiers of the Engineering Corps resolutely do not want to be stones that "show off." We have one heart and listen to Chairman Mao's words, "Serve the people wholeheartedly." We take pride in labor, find joy in hardship, and consider it a blessing to work in the mountains and forests, snowfields, and construction sites. We are willing to carry a shovel for a lifetime, squat in the mountains for a lifetime, live in thatched huts for a lifetime, be an engineering soldier for a lifetime, and be a rock that never weathers and never shows off, laid at the bottom of the roadbed on the road to communism.

    当一块永不风化的铺路石
    八七三三部队五好战士　侯朝文
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，哺育着“大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干”的一代共产主义新人。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“安心作这工作，长期的坚决的作这工作，最后出风头的还是你们。”真是一派妖言！
    我们工程兵战士，最听毛主席的话，最喜欢埋头苦干，最反对出风头，最懂得风头主义的危害。我们在修筑公路的时候，把许许多多石子聚集在一起，铺成坚实的路基，修成平坦的公路。如果哪个石子离开了路基，离开了集体，象中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的那样跑到路面上“出风头”，其结果必将变成妨碍人行车驶的
  “绊脚石”，最终不是被滚滚的车轮压个粉碎，就是被风化变成尘土。我们工程兵战士坚决不当“出风头”的石子，一个心眼听毛主席的话，
  “全心全意地为人民服务”。我们以劳动为荣，以艰苦为乐，以在丛山峻岭、林海雪原进行施工为幸福。我们心甘情愿地在通往共产主义的“公”字路上，扛一辈子铁锹，蹲一辈子山沟，住一辈子草棚，当一辈子工程兵，做一块垫在路基底层的永不风化、永不出风头的铺路石。
