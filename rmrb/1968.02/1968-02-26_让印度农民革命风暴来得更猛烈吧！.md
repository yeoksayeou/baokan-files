Since the peasants of Nasalbari in India launched their armed revolutionary struggle, the flames of armed peasant revolution in India have been spreading rapidly. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India recently led the peasants in the northern part of Bihar Province to wage a heroic armed struggle to seize land. So far, in sixteen states of India, eight states and five regions under central administration have launched "Nasalbari-style" peasant movements. The increasingly large-scale armed struggle of Indian peasants to seize land is like lightning and thunder, tearing apart the dark sky over India and shaking the reactionary rule of the Congress Party government. The Indian revolution is facing an unprecedentedly good situation. We enthusiastically cheer for the revolutionary storm of the Indian peasants!

India is a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. Peasants make up more than seventy percent of the five hundred million population of India. The peasant question is the fundamental question of the Indian national democratic revolution. The strength of the peasants is the main force of the Indian national democratic revolution.

Under the triple oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, Indian peasants live in extremely miserable conditions. Today, seventy-five percent of the land in India is concentrated in the hands of a few landlords, rich peasants, and princes. However, eighty percent of the toiling peasants have only twenty-five percent of the land. Landless and land-poor peasants pay fifty to ninety percent of their annual harvest as rent to the landlords. Ruthless exploitation and oppression have led to large areas of land in India being left uncultivated, causing rural areas to fall into bankruptcy and hunger threatening the entire country. Every year, hundreds of thousands of hardworking Indian peasants starve to death, and two hundred million people struggle on the brink of starvation. In Bihar Province, where the vast majority of the fifty million population are peasants, at least forty million people are starving. The broad masses of Indian peasants can no longer live, and they have no choice but to rise up in revolution.

Now, the suffering Indian peasants are rising up in rebellion. From Bihar Province in the north to Kerala Province in the south, peasants in many rural areas have taken up arms and launched struggles to seize land, fiercely attacking the foundations of feudal rule. What are the "laws" and "order" that protect the interests of the landlord class? They are all trampled under the feet of revolutionary peasants; what are imperialism, local tyrants, evil gentry, and feudal landlords? They are all overthrown by revolutionary peasants and stomped on. Revolutionary peasants have organized peasant associations to levy taxes on landlords, seize grain, and seize land; some have established "people's courts" to judge and punish stubborn landlords and evil gentry; some have formed people's armed forces with bows, arrows, spears, and seized weapons, making the landlord class tremble and counterattacking the reactionary military and police. In short, in places where the peasant revolutionary storm has risen, the former slaves—the poor peasants—have stood up.

Facing the burgeoning peasant revolutionary movement, the Indian reactionaries are terrified, crying out that this is a "national disaster." The Indian reactionaries gnash their teeth and scream, "It's terrible!" "It's terrible!" While the Indian revolutionary faction and revolutionaries around the world joyfully shout, "It's great!" "It's great!"

Forty-one years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The national revolution needs a great change in the countryside. ... Now there is this change, which is an important factor in the completion of the revolution."

The current situation in India is the same. Today's India has deep-rooted feudal institutions in the countryside. Princes, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic comprador capitalists are the main social bases for imperialist rule in India. The landlord class uses feudal institutions to ruthlessly exploit and oppress peasants, obstructing the progress of Indian society politically, economically, and culturally. For Indian peasants to gain liberation and for Indian society to progress and develop, it is necessary to fundamentally overthrow this reactionary ruling base and bring about a great change in the countryside.

Only through such a thorough revolution, by thoroughly overthrowing the landlord class and evil gentry and smashing feudal rule, can the poor Indian peasants be liberated, and the vast rural areas of India become a reliable base for the development and growth of revolutionary forces, ultimately seizing comprehensive victory. Only with such a great change, can the numerous peasants become an inexhaustible source of people's armed forces, become resolute participants and supporters of the people's revolutionary war. The road to victory for the Indian revolution can only be the road of Mao Zedong, the road of the Chinese revolution. This is to, under the leadership of the proletariat, mobilize the peasants to establish rural revolutionary bases, wage long-term armed struggles, use the countryside to encircle the cities, and finally seize the cities to achieve final victory across the country. The current development of the Indian peasant revolutionary struggle is precisely the great prelude to the Indian people taking this road to victory.

The vigorous development of the Indian peasant revolutionary struggle is a major victory of the proletarian revolutionary line within the Communist Party of India over the revisionist line. For a long time, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines within the CPI. The focus of the struggle is whether the Indian revolution should follow the road of the Chinese revolution or the revisionist "parliamentary road." The Danji traitor clique and the CPI revisionists have been vigorously advocating the so-called "defeating the Congress Party in elections" and the so-called "non-Congress Party government" road, opposing and hating the Indian peasants' revolutionary struggle. When the armed struggle of the Nasalbari peasants erupted, the Danji traitor clique and the CPI revisionists even revealed their ferocious nature, acting as the hounds of the Indian reactionaries in suppressing the peasant revolution. The so-called "non-Congress Party government" road has already been completely bankrupt in India.

The revolutionary faction of the CPI is determined to follow the road of the Chinese revolution. They declare: "The strategy adopted by the great leader Mao Zedong is the strategy that Indian Marxists should adopt." They go deep into the countryside, widely propagating Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Once the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong is grasped by the Indian revolutionary peasants, the flames of peasant armed revolutionary struggle will definitely blaze up. The facts prove that hundreds of millions of Indian peasants have boundless revolutionary potential. Once they awaken, no force can stop them. They will break through all the nets that bind them and rush forward on the road to liberation!

"A single spark can start a prairie fire." Let the storm of the Indian peasant revolution be more violent!

    让印度农民革命风暴来得更猛烈吧！
    本报评论员
    自从印度纳萨尔巴里农民发动革命武装斗争之后，印度农民革命武装斗争的烈火，正在迅速蔓延。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，印共革命派最近又领导比哈尔邦北部地区的农民，进行了英勇的武装夺地斗争。到目前为止，在印度十六个邦中，已有八个邦和中央直属领地内的五十个地区，开展了“纳萨尔巴里式”的农民运动。规模越来越大的印度农民武装夺地斗争，如闪电雷鸣，划破印度黑沉沉的天空，震撼着国大党政府的反动统治。印度革命出现了空前的大好形势。我们为印度农民的革命风暴而热烈欢呼！
    印度是一个半封建半殖民地的国家。印度农民占全国五亿人口的百分之七十以上。农民问题是印度民族民主革命的基本问题。农民的力量是印度民族民主革命的主要力量。
    印度农民在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山的重重压迫下，过着极端悲惨的生活。今天，印度百分之七十五的土地，集中在少数地主富农和王公贵族手里，而百分之八十的劳苦农民，只有百分之二十五的土地。无地少地的农民，每年向地主缴纳的地租占全年收成百分之五十到百分之九十以上。残酷的盘剥和压榨，造成了印度土地大量荒芜，使农村陷于破产，饥饿威胁着整个国家。印度勤劳的农民，每年有成百万人饿死，二亿多人在饥饿线上挣扎。在比哈尔邦绝大多数是农民的五千万人口中，至少有四千万人挨饿。印度广大的农民再也活不下去，除了起来革命之外，别无生路。
    现在，苦难深重的印度农民纷纷起来造反了。北起比哈尔邦，南至喀拉拉邦，广大农村地区的许多农民揭竿而起，展开夺地斗争，猛烈地冲击着封建统治的基础。什么保护地主阶级权益的“法律”、“秩序”，都被革命农民踩在脚下；什么帝国主义、土豪劣绅、宗法地主，都被革命农民打翻在地，再踏上一只脚。革命的农民，有的组织起农会，向地主征收赋税，夺粮，夺地；有的成立了“人民法庭”，审判和惩处顽抗的地主劣绅；有的用弓箭、长矛和夺得的武器，组成使地主阶级发抖的人民武装，反击“进剿”的反动军警。总之，在农民革命风暴兴起的地方，昔日的奴隶——贫苦的农民站起来了。
    面对着蓬勃兴起的农民革命运动，印度反动派怕得要命，惊呼这是“全国性灾难”。印度的反动派咬牙切齿地惊叫：“糟得很！”“糟得很！”而印度的革命派和全世界的革命派则兴高采烈地高呼“好得很！”“好得很！”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在四十一年前指出：“国民革命需要一个大的农村变动。……现在有了这个变动，乃是革命完成的重要因素。”
    当前印度的情况同样是这样。今天的印度，农村的封建制度根深蒂固。王公贵族，宗法地主和官僚买办资产阶级，是帝国主义统治印度的主要的社会基础。地主阶级用封建制度残酷剥削和压迫农民，在政治上、经济上、文化上阻碍印度社会的前进。印度农民要获得解放，印度社会要得到进步和发展，就必须从根本上推翻这个反动统治的基础，来一个农村大变动。
    只有经过这种翻天覆地的革命，把地主阶级、土豪劣绅彻底打翻在地，把封建统治彻底砸烂，使贫苦的印度农民翻身，印度广大的农村才会成为革命力量赖以发展壮大，最后夺取全面胜利的可靠的根据地。只有出现了这样的大变动，人数众多的农民，才会成为人民武装力量永不枯竭的源泉，才会成为人民革命战争的坚决参加者和支持者。印度革命胜利的道路，只能是毛泽东的道路，中国革命的道路。这就是在无产阶级的领导下，放手发动农民，建立农村革命根据地，进行长期的武装斗争，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，以赢得全国的最后胜利。当前印度农民革命斗争的发展，正是印度人民走上这条胜利道路的伟大的序幕。
    印度农民革命斗争的蓬勃发展，是印度共产党内无产阶级革命路线对修正主义路线的重大胜利。长期以来，印共内部存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。斗争的焦点就是印度革命应该走中国革命的道路，还是走修正主义的“议会道路”。丹吉叛徒集团和印共修正主义分子极力宣扬所谓“在选举中击败国大党”和所谓“非国大党政府”的道路，反对和仇视印度农民的革命斗争。当纳萨尔巴里农民的武装斗争爆发时，丹吉叛徒集团和印共修正主义分子甚至凶相毕露，充当了印度反动派镇压农民革命的鹰犬。所谓“非国大党政府”的道路，已经在印度宣告了彻底破产。
    印共革命派决心要走中国革命的道路。他们宣布：“伟大的领袖毛泽东所采取的战略，是印度的马克思主义者应该采取的。”他们深入农村，广泛宣传毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想。伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想一经被印度革命农民所掌握，农民革命武装斗争的烈火就一定会熊熊地燃烧起来。事实证明，几亿印度农民有着无穷无尽的革命潜力，他们一旦觉醒，什么力量也不能阻挡，他们将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑！
    “星星之火，可以燎原。”让印度农民的革命风暴来得更猛烈吧！
