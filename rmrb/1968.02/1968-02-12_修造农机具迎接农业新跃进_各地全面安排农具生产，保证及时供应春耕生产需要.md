To meet the needs of further development in China's agricultural production this year, revolutionary workers on the agricultural machinery front across the country are repairing and manufacturing agricultural machinery to welcome a new leap in agricultural production this year.

In 1967, agricultural machinery production saw both a revolution and a bumper harvest. Throughout the year, revolutionary workers in agricultural machinery production followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, focused on the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. The production of agricultural processing machinery and small and medium-sized tools increased significantly compared to 1966. For instance, items such as motorized sprayers (powder sprayers), roller mills, cotton processing machinery, horse-drawn harnesses, and agricultural cement boats saw increases ranging from 20% to over 200% compared to the previous year. Other items like tractor engine parts, various iron and bamboo agricultural tools also saw substantial increases. In addition, various regions produced millions of improved tools, semi-mechanized, and small mechanized agricultural machinery, making significant contributions to the bumper harvest in agriculture last year.

In the new year, revolutionary workers on the national agricultural machinery production front, adhering to the principle of wholeheartedly serving agricultural production, have made comprehensive arrangements for agricultural machinery production this year: Firstly, ensure the production of small and medium-sized tools, making sure they are sufficient in quantity, good in quality, and varied in type, and supplied on time to avoid delays in farming. At the same time, based on the rapid development of agricultural mechanization, actively produce semi-mechanized and small mechanized agricultural machinery to further meet the greater demands of agricultural production.

To produce more agricultural machinery to support this year's spring farming, agricultural machinery production units across the country began organizing teams to conduct investigations and visits to rural people's communes and production teams last winter. Based on the new situation in agricultural development and the demands of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, they made specific arrangements for spring farming tool production, focused on implementing repair and manufacturing tasks, and launched a widespread winter repair campaign for agricultural machinery. Many agricultural machinery production enterprises, to convenience farmers, insisted on repairing tools at any time, day or night, and even sent designated personnel to production teams for door-to-door repairs. Mobile service teams sent to various regions went to the mountains and countryside, entered production teams and fields, propagated Mao Zedong Thought, repaired tools, and taught techniques, which were highly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The Wuhan Small Tractor Factory produced a large number of small tractors, actively supporting agricultural production.

    修造农机具迎接农业新跃进
    各地全面安排农具生产，保证及时供应春耕生产需要
    据新华社十一日讯  为适应今年我国农业生产进一步发展的需要，各地农机具工业战线上的广大革命职工，正在大修大造农机具，迎接今年农业生产的新跃进。
    一九六七年，是农机具工业革命、生产双丰收的一年。在这一年里，生产农机具的广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，农业加工机械和中小农具的生产，都比一九六六年有了显著增长。其中象农村迫切需要的机动喷雾（粉）器、对辊式磨面机、棉花加工机械、车马挽具、农用水泥船等，都比前一年分别增长百分之二十到两倍以上。其他象拖拉机内燃机配件、各种铁制、竹制农具等，也都比一九六六年有较大幅度的增长。除此以外，各地还自力更生、因地制宜地生产了数以百万计的改良农具、半机械化和小型机械化农机具，为保证去年农业生产的大丰收作出了应有的贡献。
    在新的一年中，全国农机具生产战线广大革命职工本着全心全意为农业生产服务的方针，对今年的农机具生产进行了全面安排：首先保证中小农具的生产，做到数量足，质量好，品种全，及时供应，不误农时。同时根据农业机械化迅速发展的需要，积极生产半机械化和小型机械化农机具，进一步满足农业生产更大发展的要求。
    为了生产出更多的农机具支援今年的春耕生产，各地农机具生产单位早在去年冬季就开始组织力量到农村人民公社、生产队进行调查访问，根据农业发展的新形势和广大贫下中农社员的要求，对春耕农具生产进行了具体安排，狠抓修制任务的落实，并普遍展开了农机具冬修活动。许多农机具生产企业为了方便农民，坚持不分早晚，随到随修，并且指定专人到生产队上门修理。各地派出的支援农业流动服务队，上山下乡，深入社队田间，边宣传毛泽东思想，边修理农具，边传授技术，很受广大贫下中农欢迎。（附图片）
