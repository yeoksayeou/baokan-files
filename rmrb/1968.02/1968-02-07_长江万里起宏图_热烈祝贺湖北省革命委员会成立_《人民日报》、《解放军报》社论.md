	The winds stir the sails, the tortoise and snake are still, a grand blueprint emerges.

	After being tempered by the great storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the heroic city of Wuhan, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has given birth to the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee!

	This is another victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! This is another piece of good news on the road to the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We extend our most enthusiastic proletarian combat salute to the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hubei!

	The heroic people of Wuhan and Hubei, under the loving care and personal command of Chairman Mao, have been sailing forward along the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, breaking through the waves. "Great storms are nothing to fear. Human society has developed through great storms." Chairman Mao has repeatedly sailed the Yangtze River, displaying his great spirit in commanding the storms of class struggle, which has greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses of Hubei. With the strong support of hundreds of millions of soldiers and people across the country, they have braved the storms and torrential rains of class struggle, thoroughly exposing the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent Wang Renzhong and his gang in Hubei, and defeating the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, scattering them like fallen flowers and broken branches. The struggle was fierce. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, with Wang Renzhong as their representative, had once madly suppressed the revolutionary masses, opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resisted the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. However, it is as easy for an ant to shake a tree as it is for a handful of capitalist roaders to resist the inevitable fate of their downfall. At this critical juncture of the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, our great leader Chairman Mao, with his wise decisions and bold measures, led the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of Hubei along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to finally achieve a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hubei.

	The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan and various parts of Hubei, who have made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively responded to Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, firmly supported and protected the proletarian revolutionaries, and wholeheartedly helped the broad proletarian revolutionaries implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The army, in the "three supports, two militaries" work, adhered to the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions," did in-depth, arduous, and detailed ideological and political work. The broad revolutionary masses loved the army, learned from the army, and created a warm and close relationship between the army and the people.

	After the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the primary task is to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions item by item and comprehensively. We must vigorously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, establish the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle to carry out the revolutionization of thought. Here, the key lies in the revolutionization of the leading cadre. We hope that the members of the revolutionary committees at all levels will seriously implement Chairman Mao's mass line, maintain and carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and serve the broad revolutionary people wholeheartedly, completely breaking with all kinds of old habits that alienate them from the masses. The proletarian revolutionaries must economize in revolution, be thrifty in running enterprises, and be vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. The broad proletarian revolutionaries must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and continuously develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance in terms of ideology and politics, carry out the great criticism, promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination and the struggle-criticism-transformation in various units, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hubei to the end!

	Now, the east wind is sweeping across all of Hubei and all of China, and the red flags are flying. We are deeply convinced that, inspired by the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hubei, the broad revolutionary masses along the Yangtze River and in the central and southern regions will continue with great revolutionary enthusiasm towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    长江万里起宏图
     ——热烈祝贺湖北省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论
      “风樯动，龟蛇静，起宏图。”
    经过了无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪的锻炼，在具有光荣革命传统的英雄城市——武汉，湖北省革命委员会胜利诞生了！
    这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线又一个胜利！这是无产阶级走向文化大革命全面胜利途径中又一个喜讯！我们向湖北省广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军驻湖北部队广大指战员，致以最热烈的无产阶级的战斗敬礼！
    英雄的武汉和湖北的无产阶级革命派和广大人民，一直是在毛主席亲切哺育、亲自统率下，沿着毛主席亲手开辟的革命航道破浪前进的。“大风大浪也不可怕。人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。”毛主席多次畅游长江，驾驭阶级斗争大风大浪的伟大气魄，极大地鼓舞着湖北的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众。他们在全国亿万军民的强大支持下，迎着阶级斗争的急风暴雨，彻底揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北的代理人王任重一伙，把党内一小撮走资派打得落花流水。斗争是剧烈的，以王任重为代表的党内一小撮走资派，曾经疯狂地镇压革命群众，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对抗以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，然而，蚍蜉撼树谈何易，一小撮走资派的任何绝望的挣扎，都挽救不了他们覆灭的命运。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的紧要关头，我们伟大领袖毛主席，以英明的决策，果敢的措施，领导着湖北无产阶级革命派和广大人民沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进，终于夺得了湖北省文化大革命的决定性的胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中立下了巨大功绩的人民解放军驻武汉及湖北各地部队的广大指战员，积极响应毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，坚决支持和保卫无产阶级革命派，满腔热情地帮助广大无产阶级革命派贯彻毛主席一系列最新指示。解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中，坚持“支左不支派”的原则，作了深入的艰苦的细致的思想政治工作，广大革命群众热爱解放军，学习解放军，出现了军爱民、民拥军的亲密无间的生动局面。
    湖北省革命委员会成立以后，首要的任务是把毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实。要大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，树立毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，以毛泽东思想为统帅，搞好思想革命化。在这里，关键在于领导班子的革命化。我们希望各级革命委员会的成员，要认真实行毛主席的群众路线，保持和发扬艰苦朴素的作风，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，全心全意为广大革命人民服务，同种种脱离群众的旧的习惯势力彻底决裂。无产阶级革命派要节约闹革命，勤俭办事业，警惕资产阶级的糖衣炮弹。广大无产阶级革命派要以“斗私，批修”为纲，加强无产阶级党性，打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，从思想上、政治上不断发展和巩固革命的大联合，开展革命的大批判，推动各单位的革命三结合和斗批改，把湖北无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    现在，全湖北、全中国东风浩荡，红旗如画。我们深信，在湖北无产阶级文化大革命胜利的鼓舞下，长江两岸、中南地区的广大革命群众，必将继续以极大的革命热情，奔向无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
