In the atmosphere of gloom, despair, and anxiety that hung over both Washington and London, British Prime Minister Wilson visited Washington to hold a fruitless meeting with U.S. President Johnson.

Wilson returned to London in a dismal mood on the 11th.

At the time of this meeting between Johnson and Wilson, the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam had suffered a severe setback, especially with the South Vietnamese people's thunderous Spring Offensive, which sent the U.S. aggressors reeling and left them in disarray. This plunged the already beleaguered Johnson administration into an unprecedented state of chaos and desperation. Meanwhile, the British imperialists, caught in the storm of Asian and African revolutionary movements, had just announced the premature withdrawal of British colonial forces from East and West Asia. The political and economic crises of the British colonial empire were rapidly worsening, and the British ruling class was in disarray.

One of the key topics discussed in the meeting between Wilson and Johnson was the Vietnam issue. During the talks, Wilson once again expressed his commitment to supporting the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, despite domestic opposition, and to continue his role in promoting the U.S. imperialist's "bombing to force surrender" and "bombing halt to lure surrender" schemes. In this regard, he specifically reported on his secret meeting with Soviet revisionist leaders Brezhnev and Kosygin in Moscow two weeks prior, where they plotted to force the Vietnamese people to surrender.

To bolster the sinking British colonial empire, Wilson has long acted as a accomplice to U.S. aggression in Vietnam, particularly in actively promoting the U.S. "peace talks" deception. The South Vietnamese people's overwhelming Spring Offensive not only disrupted the U.S. aggressors' war plans in South Vietnam but also dealt a heavy blow to the "peace talks" conspiracy of U.S., British imperialism, and Soviet revisionism.

All of this made the talks between Wilson and Johnson filled with a sense of failure and disappointment, making it difficult for them to achieve anything substantial.

Another important topic discussed by Wilson and Johnson was the issue of Britain's premature withdrawal of troops from the "Suez east" region.

Just as U.S. imperialism was facing imminent disaster in Vietnam, British imperialism was forced to withdraw its troops from East and West Asia, which infuriated the U.S. rulers and exacerbated U.S.-British tensions. To ease the tensions, Wilson emphasized to Johnson during the talks that Britain's move was necessitated by economic pressures.

However, according to Western media reports, despite Wilson's efforts, he failed to alleviate Johnson's dissatisfaction with Britain, as Britain's announcement of the premature withdrawal of troops was a severe blow to the Johnson administration, leaving the U.S. "completely isolated" from Southeast Asia to the Arabian Gulf.

Wilson also discussed with Johnson the crisis of the pound and the dollar, which both leaders found troubling, and they had in-depth discussions on issues such as the Middle East situation, European problems, "preventing nuclear proliferation," and the United Nations.

After the meeting on the 9th, no communiqué was issued, and Wilson did not hold the usual press conference. Western media, in commenting on Wilson's visit to Washington, described it as the most "embarrassing" and "ineffectual" meeting he had held with Johnson since taking office. The meeting "yielded no results on the Vietnam issue," and on other issues, there remained irreconcilable contradictions.

All these circumstances indicate that under the impact of the world revolutionary storm, both U.S. and British imperialism are rapidly declining. They are like mud statues crossing a river, unable to save themselves, and are all mired in deep anguish. Wilson's visit to Washington is a clear example of this.

    在南越军民新春攻势和亚非人民革命风暴的打击下
    美英会谈在惶恐不安中草草收场
    据新华社伦敦电　在华盛顿和伦敦都笼罩着一片悲观失望和惶恐不安的气氛中，英国首相威尔逊到华盛顿同美国总统约翰逊举行了一次没有成果的会谈。
    威尔逊已经在十一日灰溜溜地回到伦敦。
    在约翰逊和威尔逊举行这次会谈时，正值美帝国主义的侵越战争遭到极其严重的惨败，特别是越南南方军民雷霆万钧般的新春攻势，打得美国侵略军人仰马翻，落花流水，使早已内外交困的约翰逊政府陷入了空前狼狈不堪，惶惶不可终日的境地；而处在风雨飘摇之中的英帝国主义在亚非人民革命风暴的打击下，刚刚宣布英国殖民军提前撤出远东和中东地区，英殖民帝国的政治和经济总危机正在急剧恶化，英国统治集团内部一片混乱。
    威尔逊和约翰逊会谈的一个重要议题是越南问题。在会谈中，威尔逊再次向约翰逊表白，他将不顾国内人民的反对，继续支持美国侵略越南的政策，并且一如既往地积极为美帝国主义“以炸迫降”、“停炸诱降”的诡计效劳。在这方面，他特别汇报了他在两个星期以前专程到莫斯科同苏修头目勃列日涅夫和柯西金等密谋策划诱迫越南人民屈膝投降的情况。
    威尔逊为了使加速沉沦的英殖民帝国得到美国的支撑，一向充当美国侵略越南的帮凶，特别是积极为美国的“和谈”骗局充当掮客。南越人民排山倒海的新春攻势不但完全打乱了美国侵略者在南越战场上的战争部署，而且沉重地打击了美、英帝国主义和苏联修正主义的“和谈”阴谋。
    这一切，就使得威尔逊和约翰逊的会谈充满着失败和沮丧的情绪，而很难有任何作为。
    威尔逊和约翰逊的另一个重要议题，是关于英国从“苏伊士以东”地区提前撤军的问题。
    正当美帝国主义在越南面临灭顶之灾的时候，英帝国主义却被迫提前撤出它在远东和中东地区的驻军，这使得美国的统治者非常恼火，美英矛盾从而加剧。为了缓和矛盾，威尔逊在会谈中竭力向约翰逊表白，英国此举是迫于经济压力而不得已的。
    但是，据西方报纸透露，尽管威尔逊作出巨大努力，却依然无法消除约翰逊对英国的不满，因为英国宣布提前撤军是对约翰逊政府的一次严重打击，它使美国在从东南亚到阿拉伯湾的广大地区里陷于“完全孤立”。
    威尔逊在会谈中还同约翰逊讨论了他们共同感到苦恼的英镑和美元的危机问题，并且就中东局势、欧洲问题、“防止核扩散”以及联合国等问题进行了密商。
    九日会谈结束后，既没有发表公报，又没有象通常那样由威尔逊举行记者招待会。西方报界在评论威尔逊的这次华盛顿之行时认为，这是他上台以来同约翰逊进行的一次最狼狈、最“无所作为”的会谈；会谈在“越南问题上并没有任何结果”；而在其他一系列问题上，则仍然存在着不可调和的矛盾。
    上述种种情况表明：在世界人民革命风暴的打击下，美、英帝国主义都在迅速地衰弱，它们都象泥菩萨过河，自身难保，全都陷入无法摆脱的极大苦闷之中。威尔逊这次华盛顿之行，就是这方面的一个明证。
