Workers at the First Automobile Works in Changchun Achieve Revolutionary Great Unity

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, January 31: The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of workers at the First Automobile Works in Changchun, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have thoroughly smashed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and achieved revolutionary great unity from the bottom up throughout the factory.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the various revolutionary mass organizations in this factory were all suppressed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Many proletarian revolutionaries in these organizations had fought side by side, rebelled against the capitalist reactionary line and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and emerged from under the white terror. However, due to differing viewpoints, two factions formed, and the "internal war" became increasingly fierce.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on inspecting North China, Central South, and East China were conveyed, under the impetus of the nationwide wave of revolutionary great unity, the two factions had discussed the issue of factory-wide unity, but due to the influence of factionalism, they did not reach an agreement. With the help of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed in the factory, the two factions repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, realizing that the fundamental reason they could not agree on unity was the factionalism in their minds. To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in thought and action, they decided to jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. With the help and participation of the PLA propaganda team, the entire factory launched a wave of establishing study classes at every level, layer by layer eliminating factionalism, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Over the past three months, the factory has held more than 100 study classes of various types. The broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, thoroughly exposed the facade of factionalism, thoroughly denounced the crimes of factionalism, thoroughly laid bare the dangers of factionalism, and thoroughly dug out the roots of factionalism, turning the study classes into a vast battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and eliminating factionalism. Each revolutionary mass organization presented a lively scene of the masses urging the leaders, the leaders leading the masses, and everyone striving to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and promote revolutionary great unity. The tide of revolutionary great unity surged forward throughout the factory.

Under the inspiring and educating influence of the situation where revolutionary great unity was achieved in various grassroots units, the leaders of the two factions consciously exposed their private thoughts, smashed factionalism, and sped up their efforts to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and keep up with the pace of the masses. They said: "We cannot let factionalism hold us back and keep us on the small hilltops. We must proceed from the party spirit of the proletariat and achieve new victories in realizing revolutionary great unity!" The leaders' elimination of factionalism, in turn, inspired the masses. When some members of their own organizations were still influenced by factionalism, the leaders, from the revolutionary principle of considering the overall situation, guided these masses to advance on the road of revolutionary great unity. This played a very good role in promoting revolutionary great unity in various units.

The two revolutionary mass organizations, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "mutually speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak about their own shortcomings and errors, and each do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and preserving minor differences," seriously engaged in self-criticism, increased mutual understanding, eliminated hostile sentiments, and reached an agreement on achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the factory. They established the Revolutionary Great Unity Committee of the First Automobile Works in Changchun.

    彻底打倒派性，坚决落实毛主席最新指示
    长春第一汽车制造厂实现革命大联合
    据新华社长春三十一日电　长春第一汽车制造厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，遵照毛主席的最新指示，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，自下而上地实现了全厂的革命大联合。
    这个厂的各个革命群众组织，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，都受到厂里党内一小撮走资派的压制。这些组织中的许多无产阶级革命派，曾经并肩战斗，造了资产阶级反动路线和党内一小撮走资派的反，从白色恐怖下冲杀出来。但是，以后由于观点不同，形成了两大派，“内战”越打越烈。
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区的最新指示传下来后，在全国革命大联合的浪潮推动下，两派组织曾经坐下来讨论过全厂大联合的事，但是，由于派性的影响，没有谈拢。在解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，两派组织反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，认识到谈大联合谈不拢，根本原因是头脑里的派性作怪。他们为了让毛主席的最新指示在思想上落实，在行动上兑现，决定共同举办毛泽东思想学习班。在解放军宣传队的帮助和参加下，全厂掀起了一个级级办学习班，层层铲除派性，条条落实毛主席最新指示的热潮。三个多月来，全厂共办了各种类型的学习班一百多期。广大革命职工和革命干部，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，大剥派性的画皮，大诉派性的罪状，大摆派性的危害，大挖派性的毒根，把学习班变成了斗私批修、围歼派性的广阔战场，各革命群众组织都出现了群众促头头，头头带群众，你追我赶，落实毛主席最新指示，促进革命大联合的生动局面，全厂革命大联合的浪潮滚滚向前。
    在基层单位纷纷实现革命大联合的形势鼓舞和教育下，两派组织的头头们都自觉地亮私心，破派性，加足马力，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟群众前进的步伐。他们说：“不能再让派性缠住，守着小山头不放。要从无产阶级党性出发，为实现革命大联合立新功！”头头铲除派性，又反过来带动了群众。当本组织有的群众，还受派性影响的时候，头头们就从识大体顾大局的革命原则出发，引导这些群众往革命大联合的道路上迈进。这对推动各单位的革命大联合起了很好的作用。
    两派革命群众组织遵照毛主席“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的教导，认真做自我批评，增进了相互了解，消除了对立情绪，达成了全厂革命大联合的协议，成立了长春第一汽车制造厂革命大联合委员会。
