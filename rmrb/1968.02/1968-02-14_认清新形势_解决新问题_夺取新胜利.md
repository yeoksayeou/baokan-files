The Party Committee of the 4587th Unit recently held an expanded meeting to seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They resolved to overcome and prevent complacency and arrogance, to redouble their efforts, strive to be at the forefront, and further improve the "three supports, two military" work.

Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The situation is constantly changing, and to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must study."

The 4587th Unit recently held an expanded meeting of the Party Committee. They seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recognized the new situation and new tasks at hand, corrected the complacency of some comrades, and made their thoughts better adapt to the new situation. This has prepared the most important conditions for achieving new victories in the future.

In the new year, the tasks before us are: to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization. This is a great strategic goal. Our burden is not lighter but heavier and more arduous. The closer the revolution is to victory, the more acute and complex the struggle will be. This is the law of class struggle. If our comrades forget this, become complacent in their thinking, or develop arrogance and self-satisfaction, it will be very dangerous.

To fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must first carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, to redouble our efforts, strive to be at the forefront, and continue to maintain a clear mind and vigorous revolutionary spirit. With this spirit of thorough revolution, we can adapt to any new situation, overcome all new difficulties, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

The 4587th Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently held an expanded meeting of the Party Committee to discuss how to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The meeting, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, recognized the new situation, solved new problems, and formulated new measures. Everyone is determined to redouble their efforts, strive to be at the forefront, continue to make progress, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

In the face of the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution, the "three supports, two military" work of the unit faces a new situation and many new problems. If these problems are not solved in a timely manner, they will hinder the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and delay the rapid arrival of a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The meeting adopted the method of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related works in a targeted manner to discuss and solve several new problems currently facing us.

Is the task "heavy and long" or has the burden "lightened"?

The first issue raised by the meeting was the view on the situation and tasks of 1968. Some comrades thought: "Our 'three supports, two military' work has achieved great success. Most of the units we are responsible for have achieved revolutionary unity and established revolutionary committees. The situation has improved, the burden has been reduced, and there will be no more setbacks." This kind of thinking exists in some comrades who are in charge of supporting the left, and some have become complacent, while others do not grasp the work as tightly as before.

Based on these circumstances, the meeting first focused on solving the problem of the understanding of the situation and tasks of 1968 among the leading cadres at the division level and above who attended the meeting. Everyone, with problems in mind, studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, learned from the speeches of central leaders and the New Year's editorial, and discussed in depth the arduousness of the tasks of 1968. Some comrades listed the various crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed in sabotaging the Cultural Revolution; some comrades listed the arduousness of the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation and the resistance of old habits. For example, comrades supporting the left in the railway system said: "Just the old regulations and systems of the railway system alone have tens of thousands of words, and many of these systems are copied from the revisionist line, emphasizing money as the commander, rewarding and punishing heavily. The revolutionary masses of the railway system have long had objections to these regulations and systems, but some old habits still linger. To complete this reform is not an easy task." Through learning and discussing, everyone deeply felt that the original idea that the establishment of revolutionary committees meant "mission accomplished" and wanted to "withdraw troops" was a big mistake. Comparing with Chairman Mao's teaching: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, ... is still a long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense struggle," many comrades felt that they had underestimated the complexity and sharpness of the class struggle in 1968. They realized that as the revolution deepens, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and other class enemies will not be willing to fail and will definitely cause trouble; the massive tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation are not only things that previous generations have not done but will inevitably encounter the resistance of non-proletarian thoughts and old habits. Comparing with the five tasks proposed by Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the New Year's editorial, everyone unanimously felt that the burden in 1968 is heavier, not lighter, and the task is heavy and the road is long. The establishment of revolutionary committees is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles, and class struggle will appear in new forms, and the struggle may have setbacks. This must be fully estimated.

Never forget the mass line

The second issue the meeting encountered was the view on implementing the mass line in the new situation. In units where revolutionary committees have been established, some comrades supporting the left only emphasize the need to establish a new order but do not pay attention to fully mobilizing the masses and implementing the mass line. The meeting analyzed the new situation and new characteristics of implementing the mass line in 1968, which are: first, the Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, and most units have established revolutionary committees. The revolutionary mass organizations supported by the army have changed from revolutionary rebels to those in power; second, many comrades in the "three supports, two military" personnel have directly participated in the temporary power organs, changing from a "supporting" position to a leading position; third, the prestige of the People's Liberation Army among the people has reached an unprecedented height, and the masses respect the army very much, and the comrades in the army speak with authority.

Everyone thought that the above situation requires us to more resolutely, seriously, and thoroughly implement the mass line. The new order we want to establish can only be a new order with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the guiding principle. The core of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses extensively, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be the students of the masses." The more the masses respect us, the more we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. The more our words are effective, the more we must humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. We must mobilize the masses extensively in all work. Extensively means to let the masses continue to develop the spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and make revolution, not to set frames for the masses, and to let the masses be the masters. We must not forget the mass line just because revolutionary committees have been established, we have power, and the army's words are effective. Only by seriously implementing the mass line can we consolidate and develop the newly established revolutionary power, complete the arduous and glorious tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and further enhance military-civilian unity. In this way, we can also establish a vibrant revolutionary new order and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Where is the breakthrough in the work?

When discussing future tasks, everyone felt that there are many tasks in 1968, and everything is interrelated. Comrades said: "The five tasks proposed in the New Year's editorial, we are all involved in, and we have to lead in doing them all." With so many tasks, how do we grasp them? Chairman Mao often teaches us that work must focus on key points. What is the key point? Everyone, after discussion, thought that we should, according to the requirements of the New Year's editorial, focus on doing a good job in the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. This is the key point. In the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, we must focus on holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes; in the study classes, we must focus on studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions; to ensure the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must focus on establishing a revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice. Everyone thought that this is the breakthrough point for our various tasks this year. Starting from solving the problem of revolutionary learning style, we can break through to the depth and ensure the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In this way, we can "open up one, open up all" and promote the completion of various tasks.

To grasp this breakthrough point, the meeting decided to assist the local areas in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The key is to mobilize the masses to hold the classes without being constrained by rules and regulations, and to establish a revolutionary learning style as the central issue in holding the classes well.

We must set high standards, not low standards

The tasks of 1968 are so glorious and arduous, with what attitude should we complete them? At the beginning, some comrades had low standards, thinking that "the work is almost done." Ask them to find the gap, and they can't find it. Ask them to check the influence of factionalism, and they say: "The mass organizations in our place have all united, and what factionalism is there." Based on this situation, the meeting learned from Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must guard against arrogance. This is a principle for leaders and an important condition for maintaining unity. Even if one has not made serious mistakes and has achieved great results in work, one should not be arrogant." Then, everyone was mobilized to find the gaps according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. As a result, many problems were found in their work, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions were not fully implemented. Those who originally thought that achieving revolutionary unity meant no more factionalism, upon further investigation, found that they still had biases towards the two factions that had achieved revolutionary unity. They were more intimate with the faction they originally supported, and they would chat and laugh when they met; they were not as intimate with the faction they did not originally support. Many comrades also checked that they did not firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and were not patient enough in doing ideological and political work with the deceived masses. The problems were found, and everyone's mind was clear. Everyone felt that our work was still far from Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the requirements of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, not "almost there," but "far from it." Everyone said: "Arrogance and self-satisfaction in thinking and low standards are major obstacles to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution."

To overcome and prevent arrogance and self-satisfaction, everyone formulated the following measures: First, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, fundamentally criticize and expose arrogant and self-satisfied thoughts, recognize the great role of the Party's leadership and the people's masses, recognize the long-term and complex nature of class struggle, and put oneself in an appropriate position. Second, mobilize the masses to find gaps extensively, listen to criticisms from the masses, and make the majority of cadres and soldiers recognize their shortcomings and maintain a clear mind. Third, work must be done with high standards and strict requirements. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the highest standard, and we must often check and examine the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Fourth, educate the troops to talk less about their achievements and more about the gaps.

    认清新形势　解决新问题　夺取新胜利
    四五八七部队党委召开扩大会议，认真落实毛主席最新指示，决心克服和防止松劲、骄傲情绪，鼓足干劲，力争上游，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作
    编者按：毛主席教导我们：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。”
    四五八七部队最近召开了党委扩大会议，认真地活学活用毛主席的最新指示，认清了当前的新形势和新任务，纠正了一部分同志的松劲情绪，使他们的思想更好地适应新的情况。这就为夺取今后的新胜利，准备了最重要的条件。
    在新的一年内，我们面临的任务是：全面落实毛主席最新指示，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。这是一个伟大的战略目标。我们的担子不是轻了，而是更重了，更艰巨了。革命愈接近胜利，斗争必然愈尖锐复杂，这是阶级斗争的规律。我们的同志如果忘掉了这一点，思想上松懈下来，或者滋长了骄傲自满情绪，那是非常危险的。
    我们要条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示，首先就要发扬毛主席提出的“要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的彻底革命精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，始终保持清醒的头脑和旺盛的革命朝气。有了这种彻底革命精神，我们就能适应任何新的情况，排除一切新的困难，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    本报讯　中国人民解放军四五八七部队党委最近召开扩大会议，研究了怎样全面落实毛主席最新指示的问题。会议通过活学活用毛主席最新指示，认清了新形势，解决了新问题，制定了新措施。大家决心鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，部队的“三支”“两军”工作面临着一个新形势，出现了许多新问题。这些问题如果不及时解决，就会障碍毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就会影响无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的迅速到来。会议采取有的放矢地活学活用毛主席最新指示和有关著作的方法，讨论和解决了当前面临的若干新问题。
    是“任重道远”，还是“担子轻了”？
    会议首先提出的一个问题，是对一九六八年形势和任务的看法。有的同志认为：“我们的‘三支’‘两军’工作已经取得了很大成绩，我们负责支左的单位绝大多数已经实现了革命大联合，建立了革命委员会。形势好了，担子减轻了，不会再有反复了。”这种思想，在有些支左人员中存在，有的因此产生了松劲情绪，有的对工作不如过去抓得紧了。
    根据这些情况，会议首先集中力量解决到会的团以上领导干部对一九六八年形势和任务的认识问题。大家带着问题活学活用毛主席最新指示，学习中央首长讲话和元旦社论，大谈大摆一九六八年任务的艰巨性，有的同志摆出了党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子破坏无产阶级文化大革命的种种罪行；有的同志摆出了斗、批、改任务的艰巨性和习惯势力的抵制情况。例如，在铁路系统支左的同志说：“光是铁路系统的旧规章制度，就有几十万字之多，这些制度有许多是照搬修正主义的一套，大搞金钱挂帅，重赏重罚，铁路系统无产阶级革命派早就对这些规章制度有意见，但是也有些旧习惯势力还留恋不舍。要完成这一改革，可不是一件容易事。”这样边学边议，大家深深感到，原来认为建立了革命委员会已经“大功告成”，想“收兵回营”，这是大错特错了。对照毛主席的教导：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，……还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的”，许多同志感到自己对一九六八年阶级斗争的复杂性、尖锐性估计不足。认识到一九六八年随着革命的深入，党内一小撮走资派和其它阶级敌人，绝不会甘心失败，一定还会捣乱；大量的斗、批、改任务不仅是前人没有做过的事，而且必然会遇到非无产阶级思想和旧习惯势力的抵抗。对照毛主席最新指示和元旦社论提出的五项任务，大家一致感到，一九六八年担子是更重了，而不是轻了，任重而道远。建立革命委员会只是万里长征走完了第一步，阶级斗争还会以新的形式出现，斗争还可能有反复，对此必须作充分的估计。
    绝不能忘记群众路线
    会议遇到的第二个问题，是对新形势下贯彻群众路线的看法。在已经建立革命委员会的单位支左的同志，有的只强调要建立新秩序，而不注意充分发动群众，贯彻群众路线。会议分析了一九六八年贯彻群众路线的新情况、新特点，这就是：一，无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利，绝大多数单位建立了革命委员会，部队支持的革命群众组织由革命造反派变成了当权派；二，“三支”“两军”人员中有许多同志直接参加了临时权力机构，由“支持”地位变为领导地位；三，解放军在人民群众中的威信空前提高，群众对军队很尊重，部队同志说话很灵。
    大家认为，以上情况要求我们更坚决、更认真、更彻底地贯彻群众路线。我们要建立的新秩序，只能是以毛主席的革命路线为统帅的新秩序。毛主席革命路线的核心是相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。毛主席教导我们：“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”群众越尊重自己，自己越要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。自己说话越灵，就越要虚心听取群众的意见。要在一切工作中放手发动群众。放手，就是要让群众继续发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命的精神，不给群众划框框，要让群众做主人。千万不要因为建立革命委员会了，有权了，部队说话灵，而忘记了群众路线。只有认真贯彻群众路线，才能巩固和发展新建立的革命政权，才能完成艰巨而光荣的斗、批、改任务，才能进一步增强军民团结。这样，也才能建立起来一个生气勃勃的革命的新秩序，取得无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    那里是工作的突破口？
    在讨论今后任务的时候，大家感到一九六八年工作很多，千头万绪。同志们说：“元旦社论提出的五项任务，条条我们都有份，条条都要我们领着干。”这么多的任务，究竟怎么抓？毛主席经常教导我们，工作要抓重点。什么是重点？大家经过讨论，认为应当按照元旦社论的要求，突出地抓好活学活用毛泽东思想这个伟大的群众运动，这就是重点。在活学活用毛泽东思想这一伟大的群众运动中，要突出地抓大办毛泽东思想学习班；在学习班中突出地抓毛主席最新指示的学习与落实；要保证毛主席最新指示全面落实，就要突出地抓大树理论联系实际的革命学风。大家认为，这就是我们今年各项工作的突破口。从解决革命学风这一环入手，猛打猛冲，就能打到纵深去，保证毛主席最新指示的全面落实。这样就能够“一通百通”，带动各项任务的完成。
    为了抓好这个突破口，会议决定要协助地方大办毛泽东思想学习班。关键是放手发动群众办，不受条条框框的束缚，并将树立革命学风做为办好学习班的中心问题。
    要高标准，不能低标准
    一九六八年的任务这么光荣、艰巨，我们应当用什么姿态去完成？开始，有的同志标准低，认为“工作做得差不多了”。让找差距，他找不到。让检查派性的影响，他说：“我们那里的群众组织都大联合了，还有什么派性。”根据这种情况，会议学习了毛主席的教导：“力戒骄傲。这对领导者是一个原则问题，也是保持团结的一个重要条件。就是没有犯过大错误，而且工作有了很大成绩的人，也不要骄傲。”接着，发动大家对照毛主席最新指示，逐条找差距。结果找出自己工作中还有许多问题，毛主席的最新指示还没有条条落实，全面落实。原来认为实现了革命大联合就没有了派性的同志，往深处一挖，发现自己对实现了革命大联合的两派群众就还有亲有疏。对原来支持的一派亲，碰到了就说说笑笑；对原来没支持的一派群众，则不够亲热。还有许多同志检查了自己没有坚决按照毛主席最新指示办事，对受蒙蔽群众做思想政治工作还不够耐心。问题找出来了，大家头脑清醒了。一致感到我们的工作离毛主席的最新指示，离以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的要求还很远，不是差不多，而是差得很。大家说：“思想上的骄傲自满和低标准，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重大障碍。”
    为了克服和防止骄傲自满，大家订出了以下措施：一、通过活学活用毛主席著作，从根本上批透骄傲自满思想，认识党的领导和人民群众的伟大作用，认识阶级斗争的长期性、复杂性，把自己摆在适当的位置上。二、发动群众大找差距，听取来自群众的批评意见，使广大干部战士认识自己的不足，保持清醒的头脑。三、工作要高标准，严要求。毛主席最新指示是最高标准，要经常对照检查毛主席最新指示落实情况。四、教育部队少讲自己成绩，多讲差距。
