	They Are Creating First-Class Work

	Not long ago, we visited the model county of the former Soviet area—Jiangxi Province's Xingguo County.

	Xingguo is a red flag that Chairman Mao personally raised during the Second Revolutionary War. During those revolutionary war years, Chairman Mao came here five times. The people of Xingguo often recall those exciting and happy days.

	It was 1929. Just as the people of Xingguo were suffering and struggling on the brink of death, our beloved Chairman Mao brought the spark of Jinggangshan and came here for the first time. The people of Xingguo, with tears of joy, welcomed the great savior of the laboring people—Comrade Mao.

	They will never forget: at the foot of Jixin Ridge, Chairman Mao taught them to take up arms and make revolution; in Wenchang Temple, Chairman Mao held a "Training Class for Land Revolution Cadres"; in Changgang Township, Chairman Mao convened them for a survey meeting.... Chairman Mao's brilliant revolutionary ideas and great revolutionary practices nurtured the thousands and tens of thousands of heroic people of Xingguo, fostering and training batch after batch of cadres who serve the people wholeheartedly. From then on, the flags waved at Jixin Ridge, and thunder roared on both banks of the Lian River.

	The people of Xingguo, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao in making revolution: "The people of Xingguo are of one heart, men and women join the Red Guards," "The bamboo poles are bent in rows, thousands of baskets and tens of thousands of loads of grain are sent to the public granary." In those war years, they forged the model county of the Soviet area with their hearts loyal to Chairman Mao. Great Leader Chairman Mao praised the comrades of Xingguo at that time in his brilliant work "Care for the People's Livelihood and Pay Attention to Work Methods," calling them "model workers" who "created first-class work."

	After being tempered by the battles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Xingguo were the first in Jiangxi to establish a county-level revolutionary committee. As soon as the county revolutionary committee was born, it took up the revolutionary tradition of the former model Soviet area, was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and led the people of the entire county to create new "first-class work" and strive to be new "model workers."

	During our brief visit to Xingguo County, what impressed us most was: the revolutionary leading cadre is red on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the broad base-level cadres love the proletarian revolutionary cause, and the people march forward on the broad avenue of socialism.

	The Revolutionary Leading Cadre is Red on Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line

	Thirty-eight years ago, Chairman Mao personally directed revolutionary predecessors to establish the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee. Thirty-eight years later, today, the people of Xingguo established the county revolutionary committee in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. The comrades working here feel infinite happiness and supreme honor; at the same time, they also feel that the task is arduous and the burden is heavy. How to keep the red flag that Chairman Mao personally raised high forever? How to create "first-class work" like the revolutionary predecessors? This is the major issue they face.

	Practice in struggle has made them understand that to create "first-class work" like the revolutionary predecessors, the key is the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary committee, the command post of the battle. Only when the members of the revolutionary committee are red in thought can they lead the entire county to be red.

	To achieve thought revolutionization, the core issue is to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, just like the model workers of the former Soviet area. To carve the character "loyal" deep in one's soul, as soon as the revolutionary committee was established, it took Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice as a brilliant example and first conducted education on the revolutionary tradition of being forever loyal to Chairman Mao for the members of the revolutionary committee.

	Just after the celebration meeting for the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, all members, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, held the red book close to their hearts and came to Wenchang Temple, where Chairman Mao personally held the "Training Class for Land Revolution Cadres," to hold the first study session. They studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" word by word here.

	The next morning, the standing committee members of the revolutionary committee walked to Changgang Brigade, where Chairman Mao conducted a survey in the past. They invited the revolutionary old comrades of Changgang Township to recount the scene of Chairman Mao's survey at that time and introduce the work style of the model workers at that time. Immediately, they held the first survey meeting at the old site of Lenin Elementary School, where Chairman Mao held the survey meeting. With the attitude of being willing to be small students, they understood the situation of the revolutionary criticism and struggle in the countryside and humbly listened to the opinions of the masses on deepening the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside. They also participated in collective production labor in the peanut field where Chairman Mao had labored and decided to make this plot of land the experimental field for the standing committee members, determined to persist in collective production labor forever and to be forever heart-to-heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	In Changgang, many songs praising Chairman Mao are sung. By the small wooden bridge beside the bamboo grove at the village entrance, there is a very touching story. In 1933, when Chairman Mao came to Changgang Township for a survey, he saw that the small wooden bridge was broken and taught the village cadres, "Cadres should think of the people in everything. If the bridge is broken, it should be repaired quickly." Later, when Chairman Mao returned to Ruijin, he still wrote a letter to the township Soviet government asking if the small wooden bridge had been repaired. The masses are still very excited to recall this today and say, "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Even the small matter of our walking across the bridge, Chairman Mao keeps it in mind!" The standing committee members of the revolutionary committee received profound education during their activities in Changgang and decided to take Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice as a brilliant example, caring for the people in everything. They saw that a section of the road in the village was damaged by rainwater and immediately repaired it.

	To be forever loyal to Chairman Mao like the model workers of the former Soviet area and to never leave Chairman Mao, they strive to carry forward the revolutionary good learning style personally advocated by Chairman Mao and to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively. Every Tuesday and Friday morning, the standing committee members of the revolutionary committee, along with the standing committee members of the revolutionary rebel organization "County Revolutionary Committee," brought Chairman Mao's red book from their respective posts and gathered together to study and help each other. The standing committee members of the two committees studying together can make the comrades of the county revolutionary committee listen to the opinions of the masses at any time from the responsible comrades of the mass organizations, feel the pulse of the masses, accept the supervision of the masses, and better lead the masses to march forward continuously. At the same time, studying with the responsible comrades of the mass organizations also facilitates guiding some petty-bourgeois ideas in the revolutionary mass organizations onto the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The dozens of members of the revolutionary committee come from various aspects, and their work abilities are great and small, their angles of considering problems are not the same, and each person's strengths and weaknesses are different. How to turn this team into a fighting collective is an important aspect of the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre and also an important condition for them to lead the people of the entire county to create first-class work. To better promote the revolutionization of this revolutionary leading cadre, with the help of the PLA, they quickly launched the activities of "one helps one" and "one pairs with one in redness." Comrade Zhang Fengxuan, the chairman of the revolutionary committee (former first secretary of the county committee), and Comrade Xu Guiying, the vice-chairman (representative of the revolutionary mass organization), are good representatives of their "one helps one" and "one pairs with one in redness." When Comrade Xu just took office as the vice-chairman of the revolutionary committee, she was full of enthusiasm and vigor, going out at dawn and returning at dusk, not having time to eat or sleep, and temporarily relaxing the study of Chairman Mao's works.

	Comrade Zhang discovered this situation and immediately used his own past experience of making mistakes due to relaxing the study of Mao Zedong Thought to enlighten her and told her, "Work is busy no matter how busy it is, but the study of Chairman Mao's works cannot be forgotten for a moment." Comrade Xu thought this was right and quickly jumped out of the circle of affairs. For a period, Comrade Xu found that Comrade Zhang was not bold enough in doing ideological and political work with some members of the mass organizations and studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line with him, helping Comrade Zhang draw lessons from his past mistakes in executing the bourgeois reactionary line and correctly treat the masses. Comrade Zhang quickly changed. They often squeezed time to study Chairman Mao's works together. They used great Mao Zedong Thought as the standard for measuring redness and used the degree of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the sign of redness. Their pairing in redness promoted more pairs in redness.

	The members of the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee are consciously making their thoughts red on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strongly leading the broad base-level cadres and the people of the entire county to create "first-class work."

	The Broad Base-Level Cadres Love the Proletarian Revolutionary Cause

	Chairman Mao teaches us, "To hold study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." The Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee is exactly following Chairman Mao's instruction, continuously solving the ideological problems of the broad base-level cadres, raising their political and ideological awareness, and leading the people through them.

	It was last October. Due to the lingering poison of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" in the cadre issue by the Chinese Khrushchev, some base-level cadres in communes and production brigades were unwilling to be cadres, and some places once showed signs of leadership paralysis and powerlessness. What to do? The comrades of the preparatory group of the county revolutionary committee recalled the land revolution years when Chairman Mao held the "Training Class for Land Revolution Cadres" in Wenchang Temple. Chairman Mao's theory of land revolution, once it came into contact with the reality of Xingguo, the land revolution of Xingguo immediately flourished. Today, to arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad base-level cadres and make them love the proletarian revolutionary cause, leading the broad masses to create "first-class work" through them, the key is to arm them with Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, the preparatory group of the county revolutionary committee and the "County Revolutionary Committee" immediately invited the main leading cadres of each commune, the responsible comrades of the revolutionary rebels, and the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants to Wenchang Temple to hold the first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class, studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them and fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism together.

	The study class, with the model of the Soviet area workers who were infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, conducted a great remembrance and comparison: remembering the revolutionary predecessors' infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, comparing one's attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; remembering Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of caring for the people, going deep among the people, and connecting with the people, comparing one's attitude towards the people and the people's movement. When they thought of the revolutionary predecessors' loyal hearts following Chairman Mao to make revolution, they asked themselves, "In the condition of proletarian dictatorship, continuing the revolution today, is it like the revolutionary predecessors, forever following Chairman Mao to make revolution to the end, or is it to be the captive of 'selfishness' and to be the unworthy descendants of the heroic predecessors?" In this way, a sharp question was placed before them, urging them to answer.

	Xie Zhaoxiang, the original first secretary of Yongfeng Commune Party Committee, had the wrong idea of not wanting to be the first in command in the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution due to executing the bourgeois reactionary line and received criticism from the revolutionary masses, once having the wrong idea of not wanting to be the first in command. When the students of the study class stood in silence in front of the martyrs' hall, he couldn't help but think of the more than two million martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the revolution in the entire county, think of his grandfather and father who sacrificed their lives for the revolution, and think of himself growing up in the Mao Zedong era, receiving a little criticism from the masses, how could he not bear it and produce the idea of retreat? Isn't this the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao? Isn't this a disgrace to the revolutionary martyrs? He couldn't help but shed tears of emotion and made a vow to the revolutionary martyrs: forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever following Chairman Mao to make revolution to the end! In the small group meeting, he made a deep self-criticism. The study class ended, and his mind opened up. He returned to the commune and worked boldly, gaining the understanding of the masses. The masses re-elected him as the first in command.

	The Mao Zedong Thought study class achieved great results. The revolutionary cadres, after studying, threw off their burdens, made up their minds, and were forever loyal to Chairman Mao, with hearts unchanging even if the sea dried up and the rocks crumbled. They went back and actively checked themselves and worked boldly. The revolutionary rebels and the poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their determination to firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy and firmly support the good cadres of the poor and lower-middle peasants to stand out and make revolution. The twenty-seven commune-level units in the entire county quickly had twenty-two communes' first in command standing out, and most of them still took the leading position of the first in command.

	After the leading cadre of the commune was strengthened and improved, they immediately brought the experience of the county's study class to the production brigade cadres and the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants and held various forms of study classes.

	Chairman Mao teaches us, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." Many commune study classes, according to Chairman Mao's instruction, concentrated on educating the cadres of the production brigades and production teams on "power." Most of the broad rural cadres come from the families of the poor and lower-middle peasants, each family has a history of blood and tears, and each person has a bitter account. The study class guided everyone to remember the bitterness of the poor and lower-middle peasants having no power in the old society and think of the sweetness of the poor and lower-middle peasants holding power in the new society; think of the revolutionary martyrs fighting to the death for seizing power, compare today's attitude towards the power exchanged with the blood of countless martyrs, and educate the students deeply. Everyone realized: Chairman Mao's instruction cannot be separated for a moment, and the proletarian dictatorship cannot be lost for a moment. Many comrades expressed on the spot that they must definitely hold and use the power well for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	"The good style of the Soviet area cadres, bringing their own dry rations to work. Wearing grass shoes to make revolution, walking on the mountain road with lanterns at night." This is a folk song praising the cadres of the former Soviet area that has been passed down among the people of Xingguo. The model workers of the Soviet area left a precious revolutionary tradition for the later generations of Xingguo. Aiming at the idea of "being a cadre is a loss" existing in some cadres, the study class, with fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism as the key, adopted the form of "inviting in" and "going out" to educate the broad rural cadres on the revolutionary tradition. "Inviting in" is to invite the cadres of the former Soviet area to introduce their past glorious tradition of completely and thoroughly serving the people and devoting themselves to the revolution. "Going out" is to visit the martyrs' tombs, visit the advanced units like Changgang Brigade that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and receive education on the spot. Through these works, many people changed from being unwilling to be cadres to daring to bear the revolutionary burden and competing to bear the revolutionary burden. Many production brigades and production teams' election results showed that the vast majority of people were re-elected. Some cadres said emotionally, "We have shortcomings and mistakes, just like being surrounded by the enemy. The masses expose them, which is to help us eliminate them. We change, which is to defeat the enemy." Some cadres said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants trust us so much. We must do better and better and will not disappoint Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasants' expectations." In this way, in a short time, from the commune to the production team, from top to bottom, a set of leading cadres was quickly strengthened and improved, with someone in charge at every level.

	Mao Zedong Thought united the thoughts of the broad base-level cadres and organized their actions. They poured their boundless love for Chairman Mao into the collective cause, and a great force tightly twisted them together. They were eager to lead the broad masses, closely following Chairman Mao, to create first-class work and to achieve the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They strove to carry forward the revolutionary good learning style personally advocated by Chairman Mao, held various types of study classes, and launched a new high tide of the masses actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. From the white-haired old people to the children who had just started school, everyone joined this great learning movement. The flowers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought bloomed all over the plains and mountains of Xingguo.

	The People March Forward on the Broad Avenue of Socialism

	In Xingguo, whether it is a five or six-year-old child or an elderly person who cannot go out, everyone knows that the Chinese Khrushchev wants to restore capitalism and is the enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants. No matter where you go into a remote village, no matter where you ask those five or six-year-old children, "Who is the Chinese Khrushchev?" they will immediately stare at you with their round eyes and answer without hesitation, "He is a big bad guy! As bad as a big landlord!"

	Whether in the fields or in the courtyards, whether in the office of the production team or in the home of the poor and lower-middle peasants, everywhere is a battlefield for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. Field criticism meetings, courtyard criticism meetings, family criticism meetings, various types and forms of criticism meetings, filled the land of Xingguo. In Changgang Brigade, we saw a microcosm of Xingguo's revolutionary criticism: look at the commune members going to work, holding the revolutionary red book, shouldering the "silver hoe," and holding high the portraits of Chairman Mao and the quotations board, marching forward in the fields. During the rest time in the fields, everyone gathered together to study and criticize. They studied a quotation from Chairman Mao and criticized a fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev in return, eliminating one aspect of the poison. Then go to visit the commune members' homes! The family criticism meetings were even more lively and vivid. Under the dim light of the kerosene lamp, a family gathered together, men smoking, women doing needlework, old people and children huddled on the bed. The old people talked about their family history, and the children shouted along, "Long live Chairman Mao! Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!"

	The people of Xingguo created many new forms in the revolutionary criticism. When Nanquan Commune criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "exploitation is beneficial," they brought in two evil landlords as live teaching materials. First, they ordered them to confess their past crimes of exploiting the poor and lower-middle peasants, then invited the poor and lower-middle peasants who were extorted by them to the brink of ruin to accuse and fight against them. In this way, they criticized the Chinese Khrushchev, fought against the evil landlords, and educated the revolutionary masses, especially the young people.

	When criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "exploitation is beneficial," almost all communes adopted the method of remembering the bitterness of the old society and talking about their own family history. In this way, they mobilized the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. Nanquan Commune's 81-year-old Liu Jibao, at every courtyard criticism meeting, actively spoke. She used her family history to accuse and refute the Chinese Khrushchev and said, "The Chinese Khrushchev says that exploitation is beneficial, which is beneficial to the four types of elements; exploitation saves people, which saves the four types of elements! We poor and lower-middle peasants must overthrow him!" Zhangmu Commune's 58-year-old commune member Liu Lunzuo, although blind, attended every criticism meeting. Everyone saw that he could not see and had difficulty walking, so they advised him to rest at home. He said, "Although I am blind, I can come here to learn Mao Zedong Thought. The 'three selfs and one contract' advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is like a candy wrapped with poison pills, wrapping and wrapping, leading us poor and lower-middle peasants to the dead end of capitalism. I have personally experienced the bitterness of 'three selfs and one contract,' how can I not come to accuse?"

	Why is the revolutionary criticism in Xingguo carried out so extensively and deeply? We respectfully asked the comrades of the county revolutionary committee. They told us that to carry out the rural criticism deeply, persistently, and solidly, the key issue is that the county and commune leaders should strengthen ideological leadership and help the grassroots train cadres. In the past period, the county and commune held large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which trained many revolutionary activists for the grassroots. The cadres lead the masses, and the masses promote the cadres, and a mass revolutionary criticism movement was vigorously carried out.

	The Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee and the leading cadres of the communes and production teams always pay attention to guiding the masses' enthusiasm for revolutionary criticism to the direction of eliminating the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev in their regions and units, thereby promoting the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. Take Changgang Brigade as an example again. In the past, whenever winter came, a considerable number of people went out to do sideline work. Now, they combine the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three selfs and one contract" black goods and lead everyone to discuss: abandoning collective production and going out to do personal sideline work, is this the poison of "three selfs and one contract"? Everyone, from the criticism of "three selfs and one contract," came to reflect on their own thoughts and believed that abandoning the collective and only caring for oneself was influenced by the black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three selfs and one contract," and expressed their determination: in the future, they must be mindful of the collective, put their efforts into the collective, and make the collective production better and better. Thus, many who originally planned to go out to do sideline work stayed and prepared the land, dug pond mud, and created a production boom. Some production teams also raised the question based on the problems existing in their units, "Is leasing the fish pond and managing the forest and mountain individually the poison of contracting production to the household?" After a big debate, many people voluntarily returned the collective's fish ponds and mountains to the collective.

	The Mao Zedong Thought study class and the revolutionary criticism fully mobilized the people and deeply educated the people. What is the socialist road? What is the capitalist road? The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xingguo, the people of Xingguo, know it clearly. The capitalist road that the Chinese Khrushchev took is a dead end, and only the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao is the bright road. In response to Chairman Mao's call, to create "first-class work," the people of the entire county are marching forward on the broad avenue of socialism!

	When you step onto the land of Xingguo, what you see first is that every village and team are filled with huge slogans saying "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." A brand-new revolutionary scene is attracting you, and a revolutionary spirit is inspiring you. Xingguo, you are indeed the red flag personally raised by Chairman Mao! The people of Xingguo, you are indeed the heroic sons and daughters who are loyal to Chairman Mao with red hearts! After being tempered by the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the correct leadership of the county revolutionary committee, Xingguo is experiencing a great leap from spirit to matter, and they are creating new "first-class work" and striving to be new "model workers."

	At present, the whole of Xingguo, like other regions in the country, is ablaze with revolutionary fire and surging with production enthusiasm. Under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, a new leap has begun.

### 他们在创造第一等的工作

    他们在创造第一等的工作
    不久以前，我们访问了当年的苏区模范县——江西省兴国县。
    兴国，是毛主席在第二次国内革命战争时期亲手树起的一面红旗。在那革命战争的年代里，毛主席先后五次来到这里。兴国的人民，经常回忆起那些激动人心的幸福日子。
    那是一九二九年，正当兴国人民受着熬煎、挣扎在死亡线上的时候，敬爱的毛主席，带着井冈山的火种，第一次来到了这里。兴国人民含着幸福的热泪，迎接劳苦人民的大救星——毛委员。
    他们永远不会忘记：鸡心岭下，毛主席教导他们拿起枪杆闹革命；文昌宫中，毛主席给他们举办“土地革命干部训练班”；长冈乡里，毛主席邀集他们开调查会……。毛主席的光辉的革命思想、伟大的革命实践，哺育着兴国千千万万的英雄人民，培养和造就了一批批完全彻底为人民服务的好干部。从那时候起，鸡心岭下旌旗奋，潋水两岸风雷激。
    毛泽东思想武装起来的兴国人民，紧跟毛主席闹革命：“兴国人民一条心，男女参加赤卫军”，“扁担弯弯一行行，千箩万担送公粮”。在那战争的岁月里，他们用忠于毛主席的颗颗红心，铸成了苏区的模范县。伟大的领袖毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》光辉著作中，表彰当时兴国的同志们“创造了第一等的工作”，称赞他们是“模范工作者”。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗的洗礼，兴国的人民又第一个在江西建立了县一级的革命委员会。县革命委员会一诞生，就接过当年模范苏区的革命传统，无限忠于毛主席，率领全县人民去创造新的“第一等的工作”，争当新的“模范工作者”。
    在兴国县的短暂的访问中，给我们印象最深的是：革命的领导班子红在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，广大的基层干部爱在无产阶级革命事业上，人民群众昂首阔步走在社会主义康庄大道上。
    革命的领导班子红在毛主席的革命路线上
    三十八年前，毛主席在这里亲自指导革命前辈创立了兴国县革命委员会。三十八年后的今天，兴国人民又在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中建立了县革命委员会。在这里工作的革命委员会的同志们感到无限幸福，无上光荣；同时也感到任务艰巨，担子繁重。怎样把毛主席当年亲手树起的这面红旗永远高高举起？怎样象革命前辈一样去创造“第一等的工作”？这就是他们面临的重大课题。
    斗争的实践使他们懂得，要象革命前辈一样创造“第一等的工作”，关键是革命委员会这个战斗的司令部的思想革命化，只有革命委员会成员思想红，才能带动全县红。
    要实现思想革命化，核心问题又是要象当年苏区的模范工作人员一样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。为了在灵魂深处刻上一个“忠”字，革命委员会一成立，就以毛主席的伟大革命实践为光辉榜样，首先对革命委员会成员进行了永远忠于毛主席的革命传统教育。
    县革命委员会成立的庆祝大会刚刚开过，全体成员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级深情，手捧红彤彤的宝书，来到当年毛主席亲自举办“土地革命干部训练班”的文昌宫，举行了第一次学习会。他们在这里逐字逐句地学习了毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》和《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》。
    第二天清晨，革委会的常委们步行来到毛主席当年作长冈乡调查的长冈大队。他们请长冈乡的革命老同志讲述当年毛主席作调查的情景，介绍当年模范工作人员的工作作风。随即，他们在毛主席当年开调查会的列宁小学旧址，开了第一次调查会。他们抱着甘当小学生的态度，了解农村革命大批判的情况，虚心听取群众对深入开展农村无产阶级文化大革命的意见。他们还在毛主席当年劳动过的花生地里，参加了集体生产劳动，并决定把这丘田作为常委们的试验田，决心永远坚持集体生产劳动，永远和贫下中农心连心。
    在长冈，人们传颂着多少支毛主席的颂歌。村口竹林旁那座小木桥，就记载着一个非常动人的故事。一九三三年，毛主席来长冈乡调查，见到这座小木桥坏了，就教导村干部说，干部要处处为群众着想，桥坏了要赶快修好。后来，毛主席回到瑞金，还写信给乡苏维埃政府，问小木桥修好了没有？群众今天想起来还非常激动地说：
  “爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，连我们走路过桥的小事，毛主席都记挂在心里！”革命委员会的常委们在长冈活动期间，受到了极为深刻的教育，决心以毛主席的伟大革命实践为光辉榜样，处处关心群众。他们看到村里有一段路面被雨水冲坏了，就赶快动手把它修好。
    为了做到象当年模范的苏区工作人员一样永远忠于毛主席，寸步不离毛主席，他们努力发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，活学活用毛泽东思想。每逢星期二和星期五的上午，革委会的常委们与革命造反派组织“县大联筹”的常委们，带着毛主席的宝书，从各自的岗位上聚拢到一起，共同学习，互相帮助。两个委员会的常委们一起学习，可以使县革命委员会的同志随时从群众组织的负责人那里听到群众的意见，摸到群众的脉搏，接受群众的监督，更好地带领群众不断前进。同时，和群众组织的负责人一起学习，也便于把革命群众组织中的某些小资产阶级思想引导到毛泽东思想的轨道上来。
    革命委员会的几十个成员来自各个方面，他们工作能力有大有小，考虑问题的角度不一，每个人长处短处也不一样。怎样把这个队伍化为一个战斗的集体，这是领导班子思想革命化的一个重要方面，也是他们带领全县人民去创造第一等工作的一个重要条件。为了更好地促进这个革命的领导班子的革命化，在解放军的帮助下，他们很快开展了一帮一、一对红的活动。革委会主任张凤选（原县委第一书记）和副主任徐桂英（革命群众组织的代表），就是他们一帮一、一对红中很好的代表。小徐刚刚担任革委会副主任时，热情高，干劲大，天亮出去，摸黑回来，饭顾不上吃，觉顾不上睡，一度放松了毛主席著作的学习。
    老张发现这种情况以后，马上用自己以前由于放松了毛泽东思想的学习而犯了错误的教训来启发她，并告诉她：“工作千忙万忙，学习毛主席著作一刻也不能忘。”小徐认为很对，很快就从事务圈子里跳了出来。有一段时间，小徐发现老张对有的群众组织的成员做思想政治工作不够大胆，就和他一块学习毛主席关于群众路线的教导，并帮助老张从过去执行资产阶级反动路线的错误中得出教训，正确地对待群众，老张也很快就转变了。他们经常挤时间在一起学习毛主席著作。他们用伟大的毛泽东思想来作为衡量红的标准，用毛主席最新指示落实的程度来标志红的程度。他们一对红，带动了更多的对对红。
    兴国县革命委员会的成员，正在这样自觉地使自己的思想，红在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，有力地领导着全县广大基层干部和人民群众，去创造“第一等的工作”。
    广大的基层干部爱在无产阶级革命事业上
    毛主席教导我们说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”兴国县革命委员会正是按照毛主席这一指示，不断解决广大基层干部的思想问题，提高他们的政治思想觉悟，通过他们带领人民群众前进。
    那已是去年十月的事情了。由于中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的流毒还没肃清，在社、队广大基层干部中，有一部分人不愿当干部，有些地方一度出现了领导瘫痪、工作无力的现象。怎么办呢？县革命委员会筹备小组的同志，想起了土地革命的年月，毛主席在文昌宫举办了“土地革命干部训练班”。毛主席关于土地革命的理论同兴国的实际一接触，兴国的土地革命立即如火如荼地开展起来。今天，要把广大基层干部的革命积极性调动起来，使他们爱在无产阶级革命事业上，通过他们去带动广大群众创造“第一等的工作”，关键是用毛泽东思想武装他们。于是，当时的县革筹小组和“大联筹”立即把各公社的主要领导干部，革命造反派负责人和贫下中农代表请来，在文昌宫举办了第一期毛泽东思想学习班，和他们共同学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席的最新指示，共同斗私批修。
    学习班以无限忠于毛主席的苏区工作人员为光辉的榜样，进行大忆大比：忆革命前辈对毛主席无限忠诚，比自己对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度；忆毛主席关心群众，深入群众，联系群众的伟大革命实践，比自己对待群众和群众运动的态度。当他们想到，革命前辈赤胆忠心跟着毛主席干革命，就扪心自问：在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的今天，是象革命前辈一样，永远跟着毛主席革命到底，还是做“私”字的俘虏，甘当英雄前辈的不肖子孙？就这样，一个尖锐的问题摆在了他们的面前，促使他们做出回答。
    永丰公社原党委第一书记谢兆祥，在无产阶级文化大革命初期，由于执行了资产阶级反动路线，受到了革命群众的批判，一度产生过不愿当第一把手的错误思想。当学习班学员在烈士馆前静默时，他不由得想起为了革命光荣地献出生命的全县两万多名烈士，想起了自己光荣牺牲的祖父和父亲，联想到自己生长在幸福的毛泽东时代，受到群众的一点批判，怎么就受不了，就产生退坡思想呢？这不是对毛主席的最大不忠吗？不是对不起革命先烈的吗？他情不自禁地流下了热泪，向革命先烈发出誓言：永远忠于毛主席，永远跟着毛主席革命到底！在小组会上，他作了深刻的检查。学习班结束了，他思想开阔了，回到公社大胆地工作，取得了群众的谅解。群众又推选他担任第一把手。
    毛泽东思想学习班，取得了很大成果。革命干部经过学习，甩掉包袱，下定决心，永远忠于毛主席，海枯石烂心不变。他们回去以后，主动检查，大胆工作。革命造反派和贫下中农表示，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，坚决支持贫下中农的好干部站出来革命。全县二十七个公社一级的单位，很快就有二十二个公社的第一把手站了出来，他们之中绝大部分人仍然担任第一把手的领导工作。
    公社领导班子健全和加强以后，他们立即带着县里办学习班的经验，请来了生产大队干部和贫下中农代表，办起了各种形式的学习班。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”很多公社学习班都按照毛主席的教导，对大队和生产队干部，集中进行了“权”的教育。广大农村干部大部分出身于贫下中农家庭，家家有本血泪史，人人有笔辛酸账。学习班就引导大家忆旧社会贫下中农没有权的苦，思新社会贫下中农掌了权的甜；想革命先烈为了夺取政权出生入死，流血牺牲，比今天自己对待无数先烈用生命换来的政权的态度，使学员们受到了极为深刻的教育。大家认识到：毛主席的教导一分一秒离不得，无产阶级政权一丝一毫丢不得。很多同志当场表示，一定要为贫下中农掌好权、用好权。
    “苏区干部好作风，自带干粮去办公。日着草鞋干革命，夜走山路打灯笼。”这是流传在兴国群众中一首赞扬当年苏区干部的民歌。模范的苏区工作人员，给兴国的后一代留下了宝贵的革命传统。针对着一部分干部中存在着当干部“吃亏”的思想，学习班以斗私，批修为纲，采用“请进来”和“走出去”相结合的形式，对广大农村干部进行革命传统教育。“请进来”，就是请当年的苏区干部介绍他们过去怎样完全彻底为人民，一心一意为革命的光荣传统。“走出去”，就是到烈士墓前，到无限忠于毛主席的长冈大队等先进单位去参观，就地受教育。经过这些工作，很多人从不愿当干部到勇于担革命重担，争着担革命重担。很多大队和生产队选举的结果，绝大多数人都是连选连任。有的干部感动地说：“我们有了缺点错误，就好象被敌人包围了，群众揭发出来，就是帮助我们消灭它们。我们改了，就是把敌人打倒了。”有的干部说：“贫下中农这样信任我们，我们一定要干得好上加好，决不辜负毛主席和贫下中农的期望。”这样，在很短的时间内，从公社到生产队，从上到下，一套领导班子迅速加强和健全起来了，处处有人把关，层层有人负责。
    毛泽东思想把广大基层干部的思想统一在一起，把他们的行动组织在一起。他们把对毛主席无限热爱的感情，倾注在集体的事业上，一股巨大的力量把他们紧紧地扭在一起。他们一个劲地带领广大群众，紧紧跟着毛主席，去创造第一等的工作，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们努力发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，大办各种类型的学习班，掀起了一个群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。从白发苍苍的老人，到刚刚启蒙的孩童，都投入了这个伟大的学习运动。毛泽东思想滋润的鲜花，开遍了兴国的平地和山川。
    人民群众走在社会主义的康庄大路上
    在兴国，不管是五、六岁的小孩，还是不能出门的老人，都知道中国的赫鲁晓夫妄想复辟资本主义，是贫下中农的死对头。任你随便走进一个偏僻的山庄，任你随便问起那些五、六岁的小孩：“中国的赫鲁晓夫是什么人？”他们立刻会瞪起那圆鼓鼓的小眼睛，毫不迟疑地回答你：“是个大坏蛋！象大地主一样坏！”
    不管是在原野，还是在屋场，不管是在生产队办公室，还是在贫下中农的家里，处处都是批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。田头批判会、屋场批判会、家庭批判会，各种类型、各种形式的批判会，布满了兴国大地。我们在长冈大队，看到了兴国开展革命大批判的一个缩影：你看那出工的人民公社社员，手持革命宝书，肩荷“银锄”，高举着毛主席画像和语录牌，雄姿英发，行进在田野上。田间休息的时候，大家围在一起，又学习，又批判。他们学习一条毛主席语录，针锋相对地批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个谬论，肃清一个方面的流毒。再走到社员家里访问吧！家庭批判会开得更生动活泼。在小煤油灯光下，一家人聚拢在一起，男人抽着烟，女人做着针线活，老人、小孩偎坐在床上。老人讲家史，小孩跟着高喊：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”
    兴国人民在革命大批判中，还创造了许多新形式。南坑公社在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论的时候，拉来了两个恶霸地主做活教材。先勒令他们交代过去剥削贫下中农的罪恶，再请被他们敲诈得家破人亡的贫下中农控诉，一边控诉，一边斗争。这样，既批判了中国的赫鲁晓夫，又斗争了不法地主，还教育了革命群众，特别是青少年。
    在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论的时候，各个公社几乎普遍地采用忆旧社会的苦，讲自己家史的方法。这样，就把广大贫下中农都调动起来了。南坑公社八十一岁的刘继保老太太，在每次屋场批判会上，都积极发言。她用自己的家史控诉和批驳中国赫鲁晓夫，她说：“中国赫鲁晓夫说剥削有功，就是对四类分子有功；剥削救人，就是救四类分子的人！我们贫下中农一定要把他打倒！”樟木公社樟木大队五十八岁的社员刘伦作，虽然双目失明，每逢开批判会都到。大家见他眼睛看不见，走路不方便，劝他在家里休息。他说：“我眼睛虽然看不见，到这里，也可以学到毛泽东思想。中国赫鲁晓夫提倡的‘三自一包’，象个包了毒丸的糖包子，包来包去就把我们贫下中农包到资本主义死路上去了。我亲身尝过‘三自一包’的苦，怎么能不赶来控诉？”
    兴国的革命大批判为什么开展得这么广泛，这么深入？我们怀着敬佩的心情去请教县革命委员会的同志们。他们告诉我们，农村大批判要深入、持久、扎实地开展下去，关键的问题是县、社两级领导要加强思想领导，帮助基层培养骨干。前些时间，县、社大办毛泽东思想学习班，就为基层培养出许许多多革命积极分子。骨干带群众，群众促骨干，一个群众性的革命大批判运动，就蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。
    兴国县革命委员会和社、队领导班子，始终注意把群众革命大批判的积极性引导到肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布在本地区、本单位的流毒上去，从而推动本单位的斗、批、改。还拿长冈大队来说吧，以前每当冬季到来，便有相当一部分人外出搞副业。现在，他们结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的黑货，引导大家讨论：丢开集体生产不管，外出搞个人副业，这是不是“三自一包”的流毒？大家从对“三自一包”的批判中，来对照自己的思想，认为丢开集体不管，只顾自己，是受了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”黑货的影响，纷纷表示：今后一定要心向着集体，劲使在集体，把集体生产搞得好上加好。于是，很多原来打算外出搞副业的人，都留下来了，整土地，挖塘泥，出现了一个生产的热潮。有的生产队还根据本单位存在的问题提出“渔塘出租，树林山单干，是不是包产到户的流毒？”经过一场大辩论，很多人都自觉自愿地把集体的渔塘和山林还给了集体。
    毛泽东思想学习班，革命的大批判，把人民群众充分发动起来，也深刻地教育了人民群众。什么是社会主义道路？什么是资本主义道路？兴国的贫下中农，兴国的人民，分得清清楚楚。中国赫鲁晓夫走的资本主义道路是条死胡同，毛主席指引的社会主义道路，才是光明大道。为了响应毛主席的号召，为了创造“第一等的工作”，全县人民正昂首阔步地走在社会主义的康庄大路上！
    当你踏上兴国的大地，一眼看到的是村村队队都写满了“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的巨幅标语。一片崭新的革命景象在吸引着你，一股革命的精神在激励着你。兴国啊，无愧是毛主席亲手树起的红旗！兴国的人民啊，无愧是赤胆忠心向着毛主席的英雄儿女！经过无产阶级文化大革命急风骤雨的洗礼，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在县革命委员会的正确领导下，兴国正在经历着一个从精神变物质的巨大的飞跃，他们正在创造新的“第一等的工作”，争当新的“模范工作者”。
    目前，整个兴国，象全国其它地区一样，革命烈火熊熊，生产热潮滚滚。在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，一个新的跃进开始了。
