Chairman Bashani of the National Awami Party of Pakistan condemned the Soviet revisionists for providing military aid to India. He stated that the Pakistani people will surely frustrate all the intrigues of the aggressors. He emphasized that the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China is unbreakable by any force.

NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the *Pakistan Times*, on February 24, Abdul Hamid Khan Bashani, Chairman of the National Awami Party of Pakistan, said that the Soviet leadership's provision of weapons to India is "a surrender to imperialism on one hand and opposition to socialist China on the other."

Bashani made these remarks at a rally near Dhaka.

He stressed that the People's Republic of China supports all oppressed peoples, including the people of Kashmir, around the world. "No force in the world can destroy the friendship between Pakistan and China and their peoples."

Bashani said that the weapons provided by the Soviet Union to India would be used against Pakistan. However, no matter how many weapons and bombs there are, they cannot intimidate the Pakistani people. The Pakistani people will fight to the end to defend their independence and national sovereignty.

Bashani warned the Indian government not to use the support of the United States and the Soviet Union to intimidate Pakistan. He pointed out that 100 million Pakistani people will frustrate all the intrigues and tricks of the imperialist aggressors.

On February 15, various circles in the Pakistani capital of Rawalpindi held a rally, unanimously condemning the Soviet leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism in providing large-scale military aid to India. Usmani, Chairman of the Rawalpindi Journalists Association, said at the meeting that the Soviet Union's provision of weapons to India proves that it is colluding with imperialism.

    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十五日电　据《巴基斯坦时报》报道，巴基斯坦民族人民党主席阿卜杜勒·哈密德汗·巴沙尼二十四日说，苏联领导集团给印度提供武器援助，“一方面是向帝国主义投降，另一方面是反对社会主义中国。”
    巴沙尼是在达卡附近举行的一次集会上讲这番话的。
    他强调说，中华人民共和国支持包括克什米尔人民在内的全世界被压迫人民。“世界上没有任何力量能够破坏巴中两国和两国人民之间的友谊。”
    巴沙尼说，苏联向印度提供的武器援助，将被用来对付巴基斯坦。但是，不管有多少武器和炸弹，也吓不倒巴基斯坦人民。巴基斯坦人民将为保卫自己的独立和民族主权而战斗到底。
    巴沙尼警告印度政府，不要利用美苏的支持，来吓唬巴基斯坦。他指出，一亿巴基斯坦人民将挫败帝国主义侵略者的一切阴谋诡计。
    巴基斯坦首都拉瓦尔品第各界人士十五日举行集会，一致谴责苏联领导集团伙同美帝国主义向印度提供大规模的军事援助。拉瓦尔品第新闻工作者协会主席乌斯马尼在会上说，苏联向印度提供武器援助证明了它同帝国主义勾结在一起。
