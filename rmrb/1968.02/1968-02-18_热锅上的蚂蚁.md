The recent New Year victories of the Vietnamese people and military in the south have struck like a spring thunder, shaking the White House and the Pentagon on the other side of the Pacific. The head of American imperialism, Johnson, and his advisors have been thrown into chaos, each one as frantic as ants on a hot griddle.

The New China News Agency, citing foreign wires, has reported accurately on the disarray of Johnson and his ilk. However, Johnson refuses to admit defeat. At a press conference on February 2, he claimed that the reports of Washington being in a state of panic are false.

Johnson tries to feign composure, attempting to paint a smile on his worry-laden face, but it only makes him look more grotesque!

If Johnson is not panicked, why did he stay up all night after the Vietnamese people and military launched a full-scale, fierce offensive? Why did he urgently convene meetings with military leaders from the Pentagon and key figures from both parties in Congress, and summon retired generals like Ridgeway and Taylor, as well as governors from various states, to discuss countermeasures? Why did he hurriedly recall Southeast Asian military personnel from leave, putting all U.S. bases in Thailand and Japan on high alert? Why is he, like a startled bird, so afraid of another Dien Bien Phu in South Vietnam, unusually demanding written "guarantees" from each member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to hold onto Khe Sanh, and nervously saying, "I don't want any damned Dien Bien Phu"? Why are American military and political leaders from Saigon to Washington so flustered and incoherent when trying to cover up the U.S. defeat, full of contradictions? Why is there such chaos and mutual blame within the American ruling class?

The West German newspaper *Neue Rheinische Zeitung* said: "Panic, excitement, anxiety, fear, desperation, almost hopelessness—this is the reaction to the news from Vietnam." Is this not a perfect description of Johnson and his cronies' predicament?

To deceive himself and others, Johnson has used all his tricks. First, he joked that he had known for months about the large-scale offensive launched by the Vietnamese people and military in the south and had detailed intelligence on it. Second, he shamelessly claimed that the Vietnamese people and military's all-out offensive was a "complete failure" militarily. Third, he puffed out his chest, saying that the U.S. had indeed made "progress" in Vietnam, while the offensive by the Vietnamese people and military was only a "temporary act of bravery." Fourth, he comforted himself by saying, "I am not a great strategist or tactician," and that "there are many things that are... unpredictable," "history is full of such events," "there will always be encouraging and discouraging moments," and "in all battles, there are many things that disappoint commanders, even the highest commanders." Finally, in an unusual move, he was so nervous that he didn't dare boast as he had before that "we are winning this war," but instead, at a loss, left himself an escape route, preparing to retreat, saying, "I really don't want to be considered overly optimistic," and at this critical juncture, "I would rather be more cautious than make any empty promises."

Johnson's pathetic attempts at self-deception are intolerable even to members of the American ruling class and American bourgeois journalists. The governor of Michigan said, "It is shocking and sad that our own government is either unwilling or unable to tell us the truth." From U.S. senators to American and Western newspapers, all mournfully lament that the U.S. defeat in South Vietnam is an "embarrassing and humiliating" affair, a "tragedy" for American imperialism.

Currently, Johnson's days are truly miserable! He had painstakingly and cautiously tried to boost or at least maintain the "prestige" of the Democratic Party government and his own before the upcoming elections this year. However, fate was not on his side. The fierce and powerful strike by the Vietnamese people and military in the south has further shattered their already plummeting "prestige" into the depths of hell!

The great victory of the Vietnamese people and military in the south not only dealt a heavy military blow to the American aggressors but also a severe political blow to the American imperialists and the puppet regime in South Vietnam. It further exposed the paper tiger of American imperialism to the world.

The Vietnamese people and military's great victory has not only inflicted a heavy military defeat on the American aggressors but also dealt a severe political blow to the American imperialists and the puppet regime in South Vietnam. It has further exposed the paper tiger of American imperialism to the world.

    热锅上的蚂蚁
    高山
    越南南方军民新春大捷，宛如一声春雷，把太平洋彼岸的白宫和五角大楼震得东摇西晃。美帝国主义头子约翰逊及其谋士们，顿时乱作一团，一个个急得象热锅上的蚂蚁。
    新华社援引外电，对约翰逊之流的狼狈相作了如实的报道。但是约翰逊却不肯认账。他在本月二日举行的记者招待会上，说中国所报道的华盛顿处在“惊慌之中”是没有的事。
    约翰逊故作镇静，想在自己堆满愁容的脸上描上两个笑窝，那只能是越描越丑！
    如果约翰逊没有惊慌，为什么在越南南方军民发动了全面、猛烈的攻势之后，他彻夜不眠？为什么要与五角大楼的军事头目和国会两党要员紧急会商，并召见李奇微、泰勒等退了休的败将和各州的州长研究对策？为什么要慌慌张张把休假的东南亚军事人员调回原处，在泰国和日本的全部美国基地普遍处于戒备状态？为什么象惊弓之鸟一样害怕在南越再来一个“奠边府”，异乎寻常地要求参谋长联席会议的每个成员提出书面“保证”，守住溪山，并心惊胆战地说：“我不想要任何该死的奠边府”？为什么从西贡到华盛顿的一些美国军政头目，在掩饰美帝败绩的时候，慌张得语无伦次，漏洞百出？为什么美国统治集团内如此混乱、相互攻讦？……
    西德的《新来因报》说：“惊慌、激动、焦虑、恐惧、走投无路、几乎绝望，这就是对来自越南的消息的反应”。这不正是对约翰逊之流的窘境的一幅绝妙的写照么？
    约翰逊为了自欺欺人，使出了全部看家本领。其一，是自我解嘲地说，南越军民发动的这场大规模攻势，他“几个月来就知道”并掌握了“详细情报”；其二，是厚着脸皮说，南越军民全面出击，在军事上是“完全失败”；其三，是打肿脸充胖子，说美国“确实”在越南“取得了进展”，而南越军民的出击，只是“暂时的勇敢”；其四，是自我安慰说：“我不是一个大战略家和战术家”，“有许多事情是……无法预料的”，“历史上始终充满这类事件”，“总会有令人鼓舞和令人沮丧的时刻”，“在所有的战役中，总有许多使指挥官，甚至总司令感到失望的事”。最后，是一反常态，心虚得不敢象前些时候那样吹嘘“我们正在打赢这场战争”了，而是一筹莫展地为自己留下后路，准备溜号，说：“我根本不想被人认为是过分乐观”，“在这个非常紧要的阶段，我更愿意得多的还是唱低调，而不是提出任何空洞的保证”。
    约翰逊这种自欺欺人的拙劣手法，就连美国统治集团内部的人和美国资产阶级报刊记者都不能容忍。密执安州州长说：“我们自己的政府不是不愿意对我们说实话，就是不能够对我们说实话，这是令人震惊的和使人感到悲哀的”。从美国的参议员到美国和西方的报刊，无不沮丧地哀叹美国在南越的惨败是一件“丢了脸、感到难堪”的事，是美帝国主义的“悲剧”。
    目前，约翰逊的日子实在难熬！本来是煞费苦心、小心翼翼地想在今年大选之前，提高或至少是维持一下民主党政府和他本人的“威信”的。可是，天不作美，越南南方军民又猛又狠的一击，把他们本已一落千丈的“威信”更是打入了十八层地狱！
    越南南方军民的这一伟大胜利，不仅在军事上使美国侵略者遭到了惨重失败，而且在政治上也是对美帝和南越傀儡集团的沉重打击。它在全世界人民面前，进一步戳穿了美帝国主义这只纸老虎。
