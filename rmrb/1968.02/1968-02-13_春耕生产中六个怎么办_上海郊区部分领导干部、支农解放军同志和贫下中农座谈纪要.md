The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses in the suburbs of Shanghai are resolutely implementing the great teachings of Chairman Mao, who said, "Currently, it is the spring ploughing season. I hope that all comrades in the liberated areas, cadres, and the masses will seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production and achieve even greater results than last year." They are taking swift action, rushing to the spring ploughing production front, and bravely striving to win a great victory in spring ploughing production and achieve an overall bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

On the 10th, the *Wen Hui Bao* held a discussion meeting with some revolutionary cadres from the suburbs, military comrades supporting agriculture, and poor and lower-middle peasants. They discussed several important issues in the current spring ploughing production.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are enthusiastic about spring ploughing production. How should the leadership handle this? Zhang Zhen, a responsible comrade from the Revolutionary Committee of Chuansha County, said:

The leadership must take the lead

Spring ploughing production is an urgent task. Doing a good job in this year's spring ploughing production is related to implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," related to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and related to supporting the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world in their struggles. In the face of such a major issue, we cadres must step forward. Through more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants has greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for collective production is high. We have no reason to fall behind the masses. Instead, we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, stand at the forefront of the mass movement, organize the masses, and lead the masses to fight a good battle in spring ploughing production. We are determined to:

Launch a mass movement. To further mobilize the masses, we held a meeting of cadres responsible for production in each commune at the beginning of this month. Each commune held a "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" rally and a meeting of representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to implement the annual production plan and launch a spring ploughing production campaign.

Strengthen political and ideological work. Among the commune members and cadres, there are many active thoughts regarding doing a good job in this year's spring ploughing production. Some say, "If there are no seedlings by the Qingming Festival, flat land will yield three hundred catties." Others say, "If there are no seedlings by the beginning of spring, three mu will yield one hundred catties." The former is blind optimism, and the latter is pessimism. We must seize these active thoughts, hold various meetings, summarize the production experience of 1967, understand the summer crop situation, overcome blind optimism and pessimism, break through the theory of predetermined outcomes, and propose a plan for an all-around leap in agricultural production this year.

Leaders must go to the front lines and strengthen the leadership of spring ploughing production. The County Revolutionary Committee has decided to send some standing committee members and cadres to the front lines of agricultural production to grasp spring ploughing production and strengthen leadership, firing the first shot in spring ploughing production, and achieving new merits for the people in spring ploughing production.

The spring ploughing production campaign has been launched. How should the military supporting agriculture handle this? Hu Jiachun, the director of the Military Affairs Department of Fengxian County, said:

Help the broad masses study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses." No matter how much support, the most important support is to propagate Chairman Mao's thoughts and help the leftist broad masses study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts. Recently, we have sent propaganda teams of Chairman Mao's thoughts to some communes and production teams to assist the revolutionary cadres in holding various types of Chairman Mao's thought study classes. Currently, among the masses and cadres, there are still many erroneous thoughts that hinder the good work of spring ploughing production. We must, through the establishment of Chairman Mao's thought study classes, vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, help commune members and cadres fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promote the thought reform of commune members and cadres, and fight a good battle in spring ploughing production!

We will resolutely implement the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, help the revolutionary factions further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination, and strive to establish the county and commune-level revolutionary committees before the spring ploughing busy season. In particular, we must quickly establish and strengthen the production leadership team, organize a certain number of forces, go deep into the production front lines, and rely on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses to immediately launch a new high tide of mass spring ploughing production.

The spring ploughing tasks are heavy, and there are many difficulties. How should political and ideological work be handled? Pan Dongcai, the party branch secretary of Zhangjian Harbor Production Team, Wusong Commune, Baoshan County, said:

Vigorously establish Chairman Mao's thought study classes

Chairman Mao said: "Grasping ideological and political education is the key link to uniting the entire party to wage a great political struggle. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed."

"Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Chairman Mao's thoughts." To grasp spring ploughing production, it is of utmost importance to vigorously establish Chairman Mao's thought study classes. Once Chairman Mao's thoughts are at the helm, they can promote the thought reform of people, and spirit can be transformed into material. Last autumn, due to drought, our production team had difficulty sowing one hundred mu of highland wheat after cotton. Because we had held several Chairman Mao's thought study classes before this, everyone, in the face of difficulties, displayed the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, and since they could not use machines to irrigate, they carried water by hand to water the land. If once was not enough, they did it twice or three times, first fighting the drought and then sowing wheat. After more than a week of battle, they finally completed the sowing of these highland wheat on time. After sowing, everyone continued to fight the drought with human power until the seedlings emerged. Now these seedlings are growing well. Therefore, no matter how busy we are, we must not forget to hold Chairman Mao's thought study classes and study and apply Chairman Mao's works. This is not only the first major task to grasp spring ploughing but also the most important task to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and resolutely carry out the resolution of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee's first anniversary.

Chairman Mao's thought study classes should mainly be held by production teams and in spare time. This way, more people can participate in the study, the content of the study is more practical, and it is beneficial to grasp the revolution and promote production. In short, there are many advantages to production teams holding and conducting study classes in spare time.

In spring ploughing production, there is a shortage of fertilizer, and the conditions are relatively poor. What should be done? Lu Qingxi, a revolutionary cadre from Xuxing Commune, Jiading County, said:

Learn from Dazhai, self-reliance is the key

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is our policy based on? It is based on our own strength, which is called self-reliance." Our Xuxing Commune was once a "point" of the old municipal committee, using the method of "eating from a small pot" to give us more fertilizer, saying, "Your single-season late rice can yield a thousand catties, and you can have whatever fertilizer you want." This fostered a sense of dependence in some of the masses. Great leader Chairman Mao calls on us: "Agriculture should learn from Dazhai." We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of "gentleman farming" and establish the self-reliant, hardworking spirit of Dazhai.

However, some comrades in our commune feel that this year the area of double-cropped rice has increased, but there is not enough fertilizer, thus generating some difficulties. How should we correctly face this difficulty? Revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants discussed this issue. Everyone agreed that we should solve it with the spirit of self-reliance and hard work and take immediate action, not waiting. The main method is to accumulate natural fertilizer. Currently, we have started carrying river mud, collecting household fertilizer, and transporting mixed fertilizer from the city to solve the base fertilizer for growing rice and cotton. Everyone believes that to achieve self-reliance, we must launch a mass movement. As long as the masses are mobilized and organized, any difficulty can be overcome.

The burden is heavy, and the tasks are urgent. How should the production team cadres handle this? Zhang Xueliang, the political instructor of the third production team, Hongxing Production Team, Fengwei Commune, Jinshan County, said:

Break down selfishness and charge to the front lines of struggle

Chairman Mao said: "What is work? Work is struggle." "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do."

To grasp spring ploughing production, it is very important for us production team cadres to stand tall and lead boldly.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one of our production team cadres was impacted by the movement and once felt depressed, wanting to step down. Later, through participating in Chairman Mao's thought study classes, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," he recalled and compared, aroused class feelings, fought against selfishness, and established selflessness, determined to grasp power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, use power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, and work for revolution for a lifetime. In this way, the cadre's backbone became strong, and his spirit was full of vigor. During the day, he actively led the masses to accumulate fertilizer and manage summer crops in the fields, and in the early morning and evening, he voluntarily carried water for the team and raised green algae well. The cadre's enthusiasm further inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, and the cadres and commune members became one, making the spring ploughing production of the entire team hot and lively.

The cadres have stepped forward. What should the poor and lower-middle peasants do? Wei Shilin, a poor peasant from Dongtao Production Team, Beiqiao Commune, Shanghai County, said:

Actively support cadres in shouldering heavy responsibilities

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Revolutionary cadres are a backbone force for "grasping the revolution and promoting production," and we must enthusiastically help and resolutely support them.

Most of our cadres are good or relatively good. Some cadres, due to not seriously listening to Chairman Mao's words, made some mistakes, and some even made serious mistakes. Even for such cadres, we must enthusiastically help them.

Last spring, several big-character posters were posted about the team leader, Lu Youliang, in our production team, and he could not bear it, so production was also relaxed. We poor and lower-middle peasants saw this and were very anxious, thinking: before liberation, he and we were bitter gourds on the same vine, our class brothers, how could we let him fall behind? So, we went to his door and studied the highest instructions with him: "Because we serve the people, so we should not fear criticism and pointing out of our shortcomings." Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, the team leader not only humbly accepted the opinions of the masses but also became a cadre who took the lead in learning, working, and laboring. Mao Zedong Thought armed the minds of the broad masses of cadres, and the entire production team had no cadres lying down and not working. They worked together with the commune members, united in heart, and achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1967.

This year's spring ploughing production has begun, and our production team's cadres are actively leading us to launch a spring ploughing campaign. We poor and lower-middle peasants are also actively supporting them. As the saying goes, "When cadres and masses are united, yellow soil turns into gold." When the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are united, achieving an agricultural bumper harvest is guaranteed.

    春耕生产中六个怎么办
    上海郊区部分领导干部、支农解放军同志和贫下中农座谈纪要
    据上海《文汇报》报道　上海郊区广大贫下中农、无产阶级革命派和革命干部，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席提出的“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩”的伟大教导，火速行动起来，纷纷杀上春耕生产战场，为打响春耕生产第一炮，誓夺全年农业生产大丰收而英勇奋斗。
    十日，《文汇报》召开了郊区部分革命领导干部、支农解放军同志和贫下中农座谈会，议论了当前春耕生产中的一些重要问题。
    广大贫下中农关心春耕生产，积极性高涨，领导怎么办？川沙县革命委员会负责人张震言同志说——
    领导要走在群众的前头
    春耕生产是当务之急，搞好今年春耕生产关系到落实毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，关系到支援越南人民和世界革命人民的斗争。对待这样的大事，我们干部就要挺身而出。通过一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，广大贫下中农社会主义觉悟大大提高，集体生产积极性高涨。我们没有理由落在群众的后面，而应该遵循毛主席的教导，站在群众运动的前头，组织群众，领导群众打好春耕生产这一仗。我们决心做到：大搞群众运动。为了进一步发动群众，我们在本月初召开了各公社专职抓生产的负责人会议，各公社普遍召开了“抓革命，促生产”誓师大会和贫下中农代表大会，落实全年生产计划，掀起了春耕生产高潮。
    大抓政治思想工作。在社员和干部中，对搞好今年春耕生产也有很多活思想，有的说：“清明不见苗，平地收三石”；有的说：“立春不见苗，三亩收一石”。前者是盲目乐观，后者是悲观情绪。我们抓住这些活思想，召开各种会议，总结一九六七年生产经验，认清夏熟形势，克服盲目乐观和悲观情绪，大破定局论，提出今年农业生产全面跃进规划。
    领导干部深入第一线，加强春耕生产领导。县革委会确定派部分常委和干部深入农业生产第一线，切实抓好春耕生产，切实加强领导，打响春耕生产第一炮，在春耕生产中为人民立新功。
    春耕生产的高潮掀起来了，支农的解放军怎么办？奉贤县人武部科长胡家春同志说——
    帮助广大群众活学活用毛泽东思想
    毛主席教导我们：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”千支援，万支援，宣传毛泽东思想，帮助左派广大群众活学活用毛泽东思想，是最大的支援。最近我们派出毛泽东思想宣传队，到一些社、队去，协助无产阶级革命派举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。目前，在群众和干部中，还有不少阻碍搞好春耕生产的错误思想，我们一定要通过大办特办毛泽东思想学习班，大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，帮助社员和干部全面落实毛主席最新指示，促进社员和干部的思想革命化，打好春耕生产这一场硬仗！
    我们坚决执行支左不支派的原则，帮助革命派进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和三结合，争取在春耕大忙之前，把县、社两级革命委员会建立好，特别要迅速建立和健全生产领导班子，组织一定的力量，深入到生产第一线，坚决依靠广大贫下中农、无产阶级革命派和革命干部，立即掀起一个群众性的春耕生产新高潮。
    春耕任务重，困难多，政治思想工作怎么办？宝山县吴淞公社张建浜大队党支部书记潘栋才说——
    大力办好业余毛泽东思想学习班
    毛主席说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。要抓好春耕生产，千重要，万重要，最最重要的就是要大力办好毛泽东思想学习班。毛泽东思想一挂帅，就能促进人的思想革命化，精神就能变物质。去年三秋，因为干旱，我们大队有一百多亩高地棉茬麦的播种碰到了困难。由于我们在这以前办了几期毛泽东思想学习班，大家在困难面前发扬了愚公移山的精神，不能用机器灌水就用人工挑水来浇，一次不行，就二次、三次，先抗旱，后种麦。经过一个多星期的战斗，终于不误农时地完成了这些高地麦的播种任务。下种后，大家发扬连续作战的精神，继续用人工抗旱，直到麦苗出齐。现在这些麦苗生长很好。所以，我们千忙万忙，办毛泽东思想学习班、活学活用毛主席著作决不能忘。这不仅是抓好春耕的第一件大事，也是全面落实毛主席最新指示、坚决贯彻上海市革委会成立一周年决议的头等重要的大事。
    毛泽东思想学习班主要应由生产队办、业余办。这样办，可以有更多的人参加学习，学习内容更切实际，有利于抓革命，促生产。总之，生产队自己办、业余办，好处很多。
    在春耕生产中，肥料不足，条件较差，应该怎么办？嘉定县徐行公社革命干部卢庆熙说——
    学大寨，自力更生就是好
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上，叫做自力更生。”我们徐行公社，过去是旧市委的“点”，利用“吃小灶”的办法，多给我们肥料，说什么“你们单季晚稻能收到一千斤，要什么肥料就给什么肥料。”这就滋长了部分群众的依赖思想。伟大领袖毛主席号召我们：“农业学大寨”。我们一定要彻底肃清“大少爷种田”的流毒，树立自力更生、艰苦奋斗的大寨精神。
    但是，我们公社有一些同志感到，今年双季稻面积增加，但肥料不够，因而产生一些畏难情绪。怎样正确对待这个困难呢？革命干部和贫下中农讨论了这个问题。大家认为应该用自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神来解决，并且要立即行动起来，不能等待。主要的办法是大积自然肥料。目前已经开始挑河泥，出家肥，到城市运杂肥，解决种水稻、棉花的基肥。大家认为，要做到自力更生，一定要大搞群众运动。只要把群众发动起来，组织起来，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    重担在前，任务紧迫，生产队干部怎么办？金山县枫围公社红星大队第三生产队政治指导员张雪良说——
    破私心，杀上斗争第一线
    毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”
    要抓好春耕生产，我们生产队干部挺起腰杆、大胆领导很重要。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们生产队有个干部因为运动中受到了冲击，曾经有过苦闷，想换班。后来，他通过参加毛泽东思想学习班，学习了毛主席的最新指示，学习了“老三篇”，进行了回忆对比，激发了阶级感情，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，决心要为贫下中农掌好权、用好权，一辈子听毛主席的话，干一辈子革命。这样一来，这个干部的腰杆硬了，劲头足了，白天积极带领群众大搞积肥和夏熟作物的田间管理，早、晚还为队里义务挑水、养好绿萍。干部的积极性又进一步鼓舞了广大社员的干劲，干部、社员拧成一股绳，把全队的春耕生产搞得热气腾腾。
    干部站出来了，贫下中农怎么办？上海县北桥公社灯塔大队贫农卫世林说——
    要积极支持干部挑重担
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”革命干部是“抓革命，促生产”的一支骨干力量，对他们就是要热情帮助，坚决支持。
    我们的干部大多数是好的和比较好的。有些干部由于没有认真地听毛主席的话，犯了一些错误，有的甚至非常严重。即使对这样的干部，我们也要热情帮助。
    去年春，我们大队里的群众贴了大队长陆友良几张大字报，他受不住了，生产也就放松了。我们贫下中农看到后，心里很急，想：解放前，他和我们是一根藤上的苦瓜，是我们的阶级兄弟，我们怎能让他掉队？于是，我们就上门和他一起学习最高指示：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，大队长不但虚心听取群众意见，而且还成为学习、工作和劳动三带头的干部。毛泽东思想武装了广大干部的头脑，全大队没有一个干部躺倒不干，他们和社员一起，齐心协力，取得一九六七年的农业大丰收。
    今年春耕生产已经开始了，我们大队的干部，又积极带领我们大闹春耕。我们贫下中农也都积极支持他们。俗话说得好：“干群一条心，黄土变成金。”贫下中农和革命干部齐心了，夺取农业丰收就有了保障。
