Revolutionary soldiers are best at applying Chairman Mao's works in practice.

A certain unit's chemical defense company's livestock keeper, Niu Zhenxi

The other major capitalist-roader within the Party viciously slanders our broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying Chairman Mao's works as "formalism," and maliciously says that "formalism harms people." This is a vicious attack and slander on the unprecedented mass movement of hundreds of millions of people studying Chairman Mao's works, and it is extremely reactionary!

The other major capitalist-roader within the Party wants to use the stick of "formalism" to deny the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought and to obliterate the tremendous effects of our workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works. This is nothing but a pipe dream! We have the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao's works. We study Chairman Mao's works with the highest degree of self-awareness. Chairman Mao's books, we love to read the most and we can use them the best. We are best at using Mao Zedong Thought to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and to fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; we are also best at using Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" in our minds, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois worldview, and to establish the proletarian worldview.

Originally, I was a soldier in the reconnaissance platoon of the chemical defense company. Later, the party branch decided to transfer me to feed pigs. At first, when I heard that I was to feed pigs, I felt that it was not very promising. I thought, with my cultural level being a junior high school graduate, it was a waste to let me feed pigs. Later, the political instructor helped me study Chairman Mao's works, and I realized that my unwillingness to do the pig-feeding work was because the "self" was playing tricks in my mind. I used Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against the "self." I took Zhang Zedong, White Agnes, and the Old Fool as examples, and made a revolution in the pigsty. I wrote Chairman Mao's teachings on the blackboard and hung them in front of me. Every day, I used them as a mirror to find gaps, fiercely fought against selfishness, and cleansed the dirt in my mind. I made up my mind to overcome all difficulties and strive to achieve "completely," "thoroughly," and the two "extremes," and wholeheartedly do a good job of feeding pigs. Chairman Mao's books, the more I read, the more I love to read, and the more I study, the more I love this job of feeding pigs.

The other major capitalist-roader within the Party desperately opposes our workers, peasants, and soldiers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice. This fully exposes his counter-revolutionary ambition. We must rise up with the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, smash his evil plot. We must study Chairman Mao's works diligently and specially, further launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, and definitely master Mao Zedong Thought.

    革命战士最能活学活用毛主席著作
    某部防化连饲养员　牛振喜
    党内另一个最大的走资派，恶毒咒骂我们广大工农兵学习毛主席著作是“形式主义”，胡说什么“形式主义害人”。这是对史无前例的亿万人民学习毛主席著作的群众运动的恶毒攻击和污蔑，真是反动透顶！
    党内另一个最大的走资派妄想用“形式主义”这根棍子，否定毛泽东思想的巨大威力，抹煞我们工农兵学习毛主席著作的巨大效果，这完全是白日作梦！我们对毛主席著作有着最深厚的阶级感情，我们学习毛主席著作有最高度的自觉。毛主席的书，我们最爱读，也最能够用。我们最能够用毛泽东思想去和帝、修、反作斗争，和党内一小撮走资派作斗争；我们也最能够用毛泽东思想和自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观。
    我原来是防化连侦察排的战士，后来党支部决定调我去喂猪。最初，一听说喂猪我就觉得没啥出息。心想，论文化程度我是个初中生，让我喂猪不是大材小用吗？后来指导员帮助我学习毛主席著作，我认识到不愿做喂猪工作，是“私”字在头脑里作怪。我就用毛泽东思想狠斗“私”字。我以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，在猪圈里大闹革命。我把毛主席的教导写在黑板上，挂在我的面前，每天照“镜子”，找差距，狠斗私心，荡涤自己头脑中的污泥浊水，下定决心，排除万难，努力做到“完全”、“彻底”和两个“极端”，全心全意做好喂猪工作。毛主席的书，我越读越爱读，越学我就越爱上了喂猪这一行。
    党内另一个最大的走资派拚死命地反对我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，这是他的反革命狼子野心的大暴露。我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，粉碎他的罪恶阴谋。我们要大学特学毛主席著作，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮，一定把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
