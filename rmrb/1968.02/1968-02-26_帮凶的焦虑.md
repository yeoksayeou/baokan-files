The resounding victory of the military and people of South Vietnam in the Tet Offensive has not only struck fear into the hearts of the leaders in the White House and the Pentagon, but also caused great anxiety in the Kremlin. In recent days, the Soviet revisionists have, on the one hand, put on a show of supporting the Vietnamese people, and on the other, have been busy scheming and plotting for American imperialism, fully revealing their ugly faces as accomplices.

While people all over the world are enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant victories of the military and people of South Vietnam, the Soviet revisionists have been harping on the theme of "reasonableness."

They have used the speeches of British bourgeois newspapers to propagate the idea that "due to new failures, Washington might 'lose its reason' and further escalate the war." It is obvious that these words are directed at the Vietnamese people. Their meaning is: your offensive is so fierce, and the defeat of American imperialism is so severe, that you will drive American imperialism to madness. It will further escalate the war, and you will suffer. Isn't this naked war intimidation?

After suffering defeats, isn't the ruling clique in Washington spreading threats of using tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield in South Vietnam, trying to use war blackmail to reverse their losses? Look, how closely the Soviet revisionists echo this!

According to the logic of the Soviet revisionist traitors, to avoid American imperialism "losing its reason" and further escalating the war, the Vietnamese people should not make American imperialism "suffer new failures." In other words, the all-out attacks by the military and people of South Vietnam against the U.S.-puppet clique are extremely "unreasonable." This is simply the most shameless slander and attack on the Vietnamese people!

At the same time, they hypocritically advise American imperialism to "listen to the voice of reason." It is said that this so-called "voice of reason" is to urge the United States to stop bombing and seek a way out through negotiations. The Soviet revisionists appear to be criticizing the United States, but in reality, they are paving the way for the United States' plot of "peace talks."

Everyone knows that American imperialism has long been trying to use the counter-revolutionary strategy of war adventurism and "peace talks" to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. The Soviet revisionists have long been working hard to promote the "peace talks" fraud for American imperialism. Now, when American imperialism suffers even more severe defeats in the Vietnam War, how can the Soviet revisionists, as the number one accomplice of American imperialism, not be in a state of extreme anxiety? The Indian Express also revealed that the Soviet revisionists' "urgent desire" to immediately "solve" the Vietnam problem is being openly expressed.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Reactionaries who appear in disguise conceal their true nature and present a false appearance. But since they are reactionaries, they cannot completely conceal their true nature." The Soviet revisionists strive to disguise themselves as supporters of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, but in reality, they have been committing countless crimes of betraying the Vietnamese people both openly and secretly. The closer the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression is to final victory, the more the Soviet revisionists will expose their ugly faces of betraying the Vietnamese revolution.

### 帮凶的焦虑

    帮凶的焦虑
    越南南方军民的新春大捷，有如一声春雷，不但使得白宫和五角大楼的头目丧魂失魄，而且也使得克里姆林宫的头目焦灼不安。连日来，苏修集团一方面对越南人民作出一些假支持的姿态，另一方面竭力为美帝国主义出谋效劳，活现出一副帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。
    当全世界人民都在为越南南方军民的辉煌胜利而热烈欢呼的时候，苏修集团却在所谓“理智”上面大做文章。
    他们利用英国资产阶级报纸的言论宣传说：“由于遭到新的失败，华盛顿可能‘失去理智，更加扩大战争’。”很显然，这些话是冲着越南人民说的。它的意思是：你们的攻势这样猛，使美帝国主义败得那样惨，你们会把美帝国主义逼得发疯的。它进一步搞战争“升级”，你们就要吃苦头。这不是赤裸裸的战争恫吓又是什么呢？华盛顿统治集团在吃了败仗之后，不是竭力散布要在南越战场上使用战术核武器的威胁，妄图用战争讹诈来挽救他们的败局吗？请看，苏修集团在这方面是呼应得何其紧密呀！
    按照苏修的叛徒逻辑，越南人民为了避免美帝国主义“失去理智，更加扩大战争”，就不应该使美帝国主义“遭到新的失败”。换句话说，越南南方军民对美伪集团发动的全面袭击，是极不“理智”的。这简直是对越南人民最无耻的污蔑和攻击！
    与此同时，他们又假惺惺地劝说美帝国主义“听取理智的呼声”。据说这种所谓“理智的呼声”，就是要美国停炸和通过谈判来寻求出路。苏修集团表面上是指责美国，实际上却是为美国的和谈阴谋鸣锣开道。
    谁都知道，美帝国主义一直妄图依靠战争冒险和“和谈”阴谋的反革命两手策略，来扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的烈火。而苏修集团长期以来就为美帝国主义推销“和谈”骗局，出尽了力气。现在，美帝国主义在侵越战争中遭到更加惨重失败的时候，作为美帝国主义头号帮凶的苏修集团怎能不焦虑万状呢？深知苏修集团心意的《印度快报》也透露说，苏修集团急于马上“解决”越南问题的“迫切的心情正在公开地表现出来”。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”苏修集团竭力假装他们是支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的，而实际上是明里暗里干尽了出卖越南人民的罪恶勾当。越南人民的抗美救国战争越是接近最后胜利，苏修集团就越要赤裸裸地暴露他们叛卖越南革命的丑恶面目。
