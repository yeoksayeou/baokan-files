Hundreds of coal miners from Lota and Coronel in southern Chile held a rally on the afternoon of the 17th to express their support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and for liberation. Many miners stated: The heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism is also the struggle that the Chilean people must wage against U.S. imperialism, because U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of all the peoples of the world.
