The People's Daily of Vietnam, in a commentary marking the 38th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Labor Party, has called on the 31 million military and civilian personnel of Vietnam to press forward and decisively wipe out the American aggressors and the traitorous clique in Vietnam.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, February 3 — The People's Daily of Vietnam published a commentary on February 3, calling on the entire army and people to press forward and make the greatest contributions to the complete defeat of the American aggressors. The commentary said: The people and soldiers on the southern front are advancing bravely under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, with a momentum that shakes the heavens and the earth. Various armed forces of the people have launched attacks, striking at the enemy's lairs and all towns. All compatriots and patriotic forces in towns and their surrounding areas have stood up with surging momentum, organized new revolutionary and armed forces, overthrown the U.S.-puppet regime, and established revolutionary governments. A new situation has emerged.

	The commentary said: Our nation's struggle is now in a stage of rapid development. Millions of people and various patriotic revolutionary armed forces have stood up and are moving forward to decisively wipe out the savage American aggressors and the brutal traitorous clique, liberate the land, and recover the territory. Millions of people, with their brave fighting actions and rich fighting forms, are creating miraculous feats, pushing history forward at a speed of one day equaling dozens of years. Once the surging revolutionary tide has risen, it will not stop for a single minute. It will sweep away all obstacles and continue to rise.

	The commentary said: From the northern bank of the Ben Hai River to Cape Cam Ranh, the soldiers and compatriots in the south have risen up in a short period of time, catching more than a million enemy troops off guard. There has never been such an inspiring scene in history.

	The commentary said: The victories achieved by the southern military and civilian personnel and the entire nation's military and civilian personnel are extremely great and important. The American aggressors have suffered heavy blows, but they remain stubborn and vicious. The struggle of our people continues, and there are still many difficulties and obstacles. The process of fighting towards final victory is still fierce and complex. We are ready at any time to deal with various situations, fully estimate all possibilities, and strive to turn the best possibilities into reality. We must constantly consolidate the initiative of offensive superiority on all battlefields, strive to expand and consolidate revolutionary forces, rally all patriotic forces under the banner of anti-American and national salvation, do all work thoroughly, and maintain a clear mind to advance steadily, attack continuously, and win continuously.

	The commentary said: We, the 31 million Vietnamese people, in response to the sacred call of the motherland, the Party, and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, are determined to make ourselves worthy of the title of brave soldiers who annihilate the Americans. Each of us in the rear, strives to make the greatest contribution to the common struggle, and completes all tasks of thoroughly defeating the American aggressors. Each of us, with the spirit of pressing forward to victory and doing everything for the complete defeat of the American aggressors, engages in fighting, production, and work, strengthens economic and national defense forces, consolidates socialist forces, fights well, produces well, and works well. We are living and fighting in a glorious historical period of our nation and our Party. The victory of our nation's struggle against American aggression will enable our country to take great strides forward and make a great contribution to the cause of liberation of all nations and progressive mankind.

	The commentary said: The Vietnam Labor Party, the party of the Vietnamese working class, is the organizer of all victories of the Vietnamese revolution. Our Party is a heroic, creative, and invincible Marxist-Leninist party, fulfilling its class and national mission and international obligations. More than a million of our Party members, rallying around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, are bravely playing the role of vanguard fighters on all fronts, ready at any time to sacrifice for the motherland, for the Party, and for communist ideals. We must make the greatest contributions to the common struggle of the entire army and people to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors, liberate the south, defend the north, and ultimately unify the country, building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.
