Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the spirit of thorough revolution is carried forward. The Guangzhou Municipal Farmers' Congress is successfully convened.

The congratulatory telegrams from the State Council and the Central Cultural Revolution Group greatly encouraged the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

New China News Agency, Guangzhou, February 18th: Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the hundred million poor and lower-middle peasants of Guangzhou, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, achieved revolutionary great unity and successfully convened the first session of the Guangzhou Municipal Farmers' Congress on February 17th and 18th. This is another new victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the Guangzhou region.

The congress received congratulatory telegrams from the State Council and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. When the telegrams were read at the congress, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. The representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

The successful convening of the Guangzhou Municipal Farmers' Congress is a fruitful result of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Guangzhou implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In recent times, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Guangzhou have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, taking "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, and held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly repudiate selfishness and establish public spirit, overcome factionalism and anarchism, enhance party spirit, raise class consciousness, and promote the rapid realization of revolutionary great unity. At present, 3.8 million poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire city have participated in the study classes.

During the congress, the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants summarized their achievements and exchanged experiences. They are determined to further hold and improve Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and repudiation. They will overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and achieve new victories in the great struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

The congress called on the poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire city to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," take Dazhai as an example, be self-reliant, and strive hard. They will focus on the revolution, vigorously promote production. At present, they will immediately launch a new high tide of spring plowing and production to achieve even greater harvests in agriculture this year. Responsible comrades from the Guangzhou Military Region, the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, and the Guangdong Military Region attended the congress.
