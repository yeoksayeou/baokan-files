In 1961, under the direction of the Chinese Khrushchev, Zhou Yang, in order to further organize his counter-revolutionary literary and artistic troops, publicly raised the slogan of "broad unity."

The people Zhou Yang wanted to "broadly unite" with were those writers and artists who had long lived in the midst of fierce struggles among the workers, peasants, and soldiers? No, absolutely not! Towards the writers and artists among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, Zhou Yang and his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, were extremely contemptuous. As early as 1956, the Chinese Khrushchev had personally attacked them, calling them "only knowing a little about the common people" and "useless"...

The people Zhou Yang wanted to "broadly unite" with were those who were fighting on the front lines of the literary and artistic world as proletarian warriors? No, absolutely not! Towards the true proletarian literary and artistic warriors, Zhou Yang and his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, were terrified and hated them to the core, even going so far as to repeatedly organize ghosts and snakes to attack them.

So, who exactly were the people Zhou Yang wanted to "broadly unite" with? In March and April of 1961, Zhou Yang, through his mouthpiece, the *Literary Gazette*, gave a "vivid" answer. Zhou Yang and his ilk said that they raised this slogan of "broad unity" to "allow those hesitant gentlemen to be free from the worry of being suspected in the wrong place"; to "ensure that no aspiring talents or useful people are neglected or suppressed"...

In our socialist society today, who exactly are those who are full of complaints and "hesitant"? Under our powerful dictatorship of the proletariat, who exactly are those who feel "neglected" and "suppressed"? It is not others, but precisely those who insist on reactionary positions from the 1930s, the stinking "authorities" of the bourgeoisie! Those traitorous writers, turncoats, spies, and all kinds of counter-revolutionaries! The core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique had not once screamed hysterically that they were "enveloped in great anguish," "like wearing a cangue," and "would be crushed to death"?

It turns out that the people Zhou Yang wanted to "broadly unite" with were precisely such a bunch of ghosts and snakes! Zhou Yang's so-called "broad unity" was precisely such a thoroughly counter-revolutionary organizational line!

Chairman Mao taught us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." The reason Zhou Yang and his ilk desperately pushed this counter-revolutionary organizational line in the literary and artistic circles was precisely to adapt to the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary political line. As early as the 1930s, the Chinese Khrushchev had intervened in the literary and artistic circles, becoming the black backer of Zhou Yang and his gang. He openly instructed Zhou Yang, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and Yang Han-sheng and the like to recruit and accept defectors without any scruples, saying, "You should be more daring and more open-minded, completely open the door... regardless of which party, which organization, or what kind of individual, you should all invite them in." The slogan of "broad unity" that Zhou Yang publicly raised in 1961 was precisely to "dare more" and "be more open-minded" throughout the entire literary and artistic circles to "invite" anti-party and anti-socialist "aspiring talents" and "useful people" for the Chinese Khrushchev, to serve as his vanguard in restoring capitalism.

Under Zhou Yang's slogan of "broad unity," notorious traitors were praised as "rare talents in China"; under Zhou Yang's slogan of "broad unity," the core members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique were able to publish articles in the *Literary Gazette* in 1962; Zhou Yang even publicly shouted at a meeting that he would specially "organize a group of rightists" to engage in their counter-revolutionary work...

For a long time, Zhou Yang and his gang had been desperately pushing this line of recruiting and accepting defectors, "inviting" a large number of traitorous writers, anti-communist veterans, turncoats, spies, rightists, and hooligans, placing them in various important positions, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship in the literary and artistic circles. They used newspapers, screens, and stages to madly engage in counter-revolutionary propaganda, even openly issuing counter-revolutionary cries, inciting "greenwood knights," "disgruntled women," "overseas" and "land-based" people to "join hands," and systematically and plannedly engage in anti-party and anti-socialist criminal activities, becoming a counter-revolutionary commando unit for the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism.

As early as 1955, our great leader Chairman Mao had already sounded the alarm for us: "In the past, it was said that there was a group of pure cultural people, which is not correct... Their main force, either imperialist Kuomintang spies, or Trotskyites, or reactionary officers, or Communist Party traitors, these people formed the backbone and constituted a hidden counter-revolutionary faction in the revolutionary camp, an underground independent kingdom." We must rise up with the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash this "hidden counter-revolutionary faction" in the literary and artistic circles led by Zhou Yang, and seize back the leadership of all literary and artistic units that need to seize power into the hands of the proletariat!

    周扬的“广泛团结”是什么货色
    蔡辉
    一九六一年，在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，周扬为了进一步组织他的反革命文艺队伍，公开提出了一个口号——“广泛团结”。
    周扬所要“广泛团结”的，是那些长期生活在火热斗争中的工农兵作家吗？不是，根本不是！对于工农兵作家，周扬及其主子中国赫鲁晓夫是极端鄙视的。早在一九五六年，中国赫鲁晓夫就曾亲自出马，大骂他们“只懂得关于老百姓的一点东西”，大骂他们“不行”……
    周扬所要“广泛团结”的，是那些在文艺战线上冲锋陷阵的无产阶级战士吗？不是，根本不是！对于真正的无产阶级文艺战士，周扬及其主子中国赫鲁晓夫，怕得要死，恨得要命，甚至不惜一再组织牛鬼蛇神，对他们进行围攻。
    那么，周扬所要“广泛团结”的，究竟是些什么人呢？一九六一年三、四月，周扬通过他的喉舌《文艺报》，对此作了一个“形象”的回答。周扬之流说，他们之所以提出这个“广泛团结”的口号，就是为了“让那些搔首踟蹰的君子，免除瓜田李下的杞忧”；就是为了“不使任何有志之士，有用之才受到冷淡或压抑”……
    在我们今天的社会主义社会中，究竟是谁才会牢骚满腹、“搔首踟蹰”？在我们强大的无产阶级专政下，究竟是什么人才会感到受“冷淡”，受“压抑”？不是别人，正是那些坚持反动立场的三十年代“祖师爷”、资产阶级的臭“权威”！是那些汉奸文人、叛徒、特务，以及形形色色的反革命分子！胡风及其反革命集团的骨干分子，不是曾经歇斯底里地叫喊过他们“笼罩着绝大的苦闷”，“等于带上了枷”，“会被压死”吗？
    原来，周扬所要“广泛团结”的，就是这样一批牛鬼蛇神！周扬所谓的“广泛团结”，就是这样一条彻头彻尾的反革命组织路线！
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”周扬之流所以在文艺界拚命地推行这一条反革命组织路线，正是为了适应中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命政治路线的需要。早在三十年代，中国赫鲁晓夫就插手文艺界，成为周扬一伙的黑后台。他公开指使周扬、田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙之流可以毫无顾忌地招降纳叛，说什么“要更大胆些，更放手些，把门完全打开……不管什么党派，什么团体，什么样式的个人，你们都要去招致来”。周扬在一九六一年公开提出的“广泛团结”的口号，正是为了在整个文艺界“更大胆”、“更放手”地去为中国赫鲁晓夫“招致”反党反社会主义的“有志之士”、“有用之才”，充当其复辟资本主义的马前卒。
    在周扬这个“广泛团结”的口号下，臭名昭著的大汉奸竟然被他们吹捧成“中国难得的人才”；在周扬这个“广泛团结”的口号下，胡风反革命集团的骨干分子，竟然能够在一九六二年的《文艺报》上发表文章；周扬甚至还在一次会议上公开叫嚷，他要专门去“组织一批右派分子”来从事他们的反革命工作……
    长期以来，周扬一伙正是这样拚命地推行招降纳叛的组织路线，“招致”了大批的汉奸文人、反共老手、叛徒、特务、右派、流氓，把他们安插在各种重要岗位上，在文艺界实行了资产阶级专政。他们利用报刊、银幕、舞台，疯狂地进行反革命宣传，甚至公开地发出反革命的叫嚣，煽动“绿林豪客”、“闺门怨女”，“海外”的和“陆上”的，“手儿相牵”，有组织有计划地进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，成了中国赫鲁晓夫进行资本主义复辟的一支反革命别动队。
    早在一九五五年，我们的伟大领袖毛主席就已向我们敲响警钟：“过去说是一批单纯的文化人，不对了，……他们的基本队伍，或是帝国主义国民党的特务，或是托洛茨基分子，或是反动军官，或是共产党的叛徒，由这些人做骨干组成了一个暗藏在革命阵营的反革命派别，一个地下的独立王国。”我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底捣毁文艺界以周扬为首的这个“暗藏在革命阵营的反革命派别”，把一切需要夺权的文艺单位的领导权，夺回到无产阶级手中！
