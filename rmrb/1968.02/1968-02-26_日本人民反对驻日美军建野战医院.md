On the evening of the 20th, two thousand Japanese workers, youth, students, and citizens gathered in Tokyo to hold a meeting in opposition to the decision by the U.S. military authorities in Japan to establish a field hospital in the Prince Camp of the U.S. military in Tokyo for wounded American soldiers from the Vietnam War.

After the meeting concluded, the crowd broke through the police blockade and marched to the gates of the Prince Camp to hold a demonstration. The police brutally beat the demonstrators, arresting thirty-six people.
