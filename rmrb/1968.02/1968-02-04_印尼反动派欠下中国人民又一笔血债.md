The Suharto-Nasution reactionary regime in Indonesia has recently carried out horrifying large-scale massacres and persecutions of overseas Chinese in West Kalimantan. Countless overseas Chinese have been brutally murdered, and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes. The entire region is shrouded in a fascist atmosphere of terror. The Indonesian reactionary government has once again incurred a new debt of blood against the Chinese people.

The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique originally came to power through the massacre of the people. In the more than two years since it took power, it has on the one hand continued to carry out bloody suppression of the Indonesian people, and on the other hand has been crazed in its persecution of overseas Chinese, attempting to use these fascist methods to consolidate its counterrevolutionary regime. However, the result has been the opposite. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All reactionaries want to use slaughter to eliminate revolution. They think that the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will be. But contrary to this reactionary wish, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary forces become, and the closer the reactionaries come to destruction. This is an irresistible law." The counterrevolutionary policies pursued by the Indonesian reactionary government have greatly exacerbated class contradictions within Indonesia, arousing increasingly strong resistance from the broad masses of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian reactionaries' repeated waves of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment, aimed at diverting the attention of the domestic people, are completely futile.

At present, the revolutionary forces in Indonesia are regrouping in the vast rural areas, raising the torch of armed revolutionary struggle, and launching guerrilla warfare. In particular, the people's guerrilla warfare in the West Kalimantan region has developed significantly, striking a heavy blow against the Indonesian reactionaries. The Suharto-Nasution clique, in a state of panic, has carried out inhuman fascist atrocities in West Kalimantan in an attempt to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the people in that region. However, the Indonesian reactionaries' backsliding will only further expose their counterrevolutionary nature and further promote the development of revolutionary armed struggle in West Kalimantan and other regions of Indonesia.

Inciting racial sentiment and creating ethnic conflicts is a common tactic used by imperialists and reactionaries to cover up their contradictions with the broad masses of the people and to achieve their counterrevolutionary goals. This time, under the direction and coordination of U.S. imperialism, the Indonesian reactionary government actually dispatched its soldiers disguised as overseas Chinese to attack the Dayak residents of West Kalimantan, thereby destroying the traditional friendly relations between overseas Chinese and the Dayak people and inciting ethnic conflict. How vile their intentions are!

However, the Indonesian reactionaries' schemes and tricks will never succeed. For hundreds of years, overseas Chinese who have settled in West Kalimantan have lived in harmony with the local Dayak residents, and their friendship runs deep. Their fate is shared, and their interests are the same. The Indonesian reactionaries are oppressors of both the overseas Chinese and the local Dayak residents. The Dayak residents will certainly see through the Indonesian reactionary government's evil plot to sow discord among the ethnic groups and will resolutely fight against the evil fascist regime.

For more than two years, our patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia have suffered cruel persecution at the hands of the Indonesian reactionaries. They have fought unyieldingly to defend the dignity of their motherland and their legitimate rights, displaying a great spirit of indomitability. In the face of the Indonesian reactionaries' new anti-Chinese schemes, our patriotic overseas Chinese will surely unite more closely, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely standing with the Indonesian people to wage a struggle of principle against the Indonesian reactionaries. The seven hundred million people of our motherland will forever be the strong backing of our patriotic overseas Chinese.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All aggressors and their running dogs in the world will all be buried, and the time will not be long. They will definitely not escape." The Indonesian fascist military regime, which is now surrounded by the broad masses of the Indonesian people, no matter how it struggles and counterattacks, will absolutely not escape its doom.

    印尼反动派欠下中国人民又一笔血债
    本报评论员
    印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动政权，最近在西加里曼丹制造了骇人听闻的大规模屠杀和迫害华侨的法西斯暴行。大批华侨惨遭杀害，数以万计的华侨流离失所。整个西加里曼丹笼罩在一片法西斯恐怖气氛之中。印尼反动政府对中国人民又欠下一笔新的血债。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团本来就是靠屠杀人民起家的。它上台两年多以来，一方面不断地对印尼人民进行血腥镇压，一方面疯狂地迫害华侨，企图用这种法西斯手段来巩固其反革命政权。但是，结果却适得其反。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”印尼反动政府推行的反革命政策，大大加剧了印尼国内的阶级矛盾，激起印尼广大人民越来越强烈的反抗。印尼反动派不断掀起反华、排华的浪潮，以图转移国内人民的视线，这完全是徒劳的。
    目前，印尼革命力量正在广大农村地区重新集结起来，举起革命武装斗争的火炬，展开游击战争。特别是西加里曼丹地区的人民游击战争，已经有了很大的发展，狠狠地打击了印尼反动派。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安集团惊慌失措，就在西加里曼丹制造灭绝人性的法西斯暴行，妄图扑灭这个地区人民的革命烈火。但是，印尼反动派的这种倒行逆施，只能更加暴露他们的反革命面目，进一步促进西加里曼丹和印尼其他地区革命武装斗争的发展。
    煽动种族主义情绪，制造民族冲突，这是帝国主义和反动派用以掩盖他们同广大人民之间的矛盾，以实现其反革命目的的一种惯技。这一次，在美帝国主义的指使和配合下，印尼反动政府竟指派它的军人化装为华侨，袭击西加里曼丹的达亚克族居民，以此来破坏华侨和达亚克族的传统的友好关系，挑起民族冲突。用心何其毒也！
    但是，印尼反动派的这种阴谋诡计，是决不会得逞的。几百年来定居在西加里曼丹的华侨，世世代代同当地达亚克族居民和睦相处，友谊深厚，他们的命运是共同的，利益是一致的。印尼反动派既是华侨的压迫者，也是当地达亚克族居民的压迫者。达亚克族居民必然会识破印尼反动政权挑拨民族关系的罪恶阴谋，坚决地为反对万恶的法西斯暴政而斗争。
    在印尼的我爱国侨胞，两年多以来受尽了印尼反动派的残酷迫害。他们为维护祖国的尊严和自己的正当权益，进行了不屈不挠的斗争，表现了威武不能屈的伟大气魄。面对着印尼反动派新的排华阴谋，我爱国侨胞必将更加紧密地团结起来，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决和印尼人民站在一起，同印尼反动派进行针锋相对的斗争。七亿祖国人民永远是我爱国侨胞的坚强后盾。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“世界上一切侵略者及其走狗，通通都要被埋葬掉，为期不会很远。他们一定逃不掉的。”正陷入印尼广大人民包围之中的印尼法西斯军人政权，不管怎样进行挣扎和反扑，绝对逃脱不了最后灭亡的命运。
