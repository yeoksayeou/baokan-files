Today, in the revolutionary old base area of Jiangxi, the atmosphere is filled with the fervent spirit of military love for the people, people's support for the military, and the close unity between the military and civilians. The heroic sons and daughters of Jinggangshan and the people's children in the army, recalling the more than a year of joint struggle during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, unanimously declare:

Soldiers and civilians are the foundation of victory.

Military-civilian unity based on Mao Zedong Thought has promoted the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and is a crucial guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Military-civilian unity based on Mao Zedong Thought propels the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward

At this critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in Jiangxi, the former Red Army soldiers led the heroic troops, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," to enter Jiangxi to support the left. The sons and daughters of Jinggangshan, who were fighting bravely against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, saw their comrades and were overcome with emotion, tears streaming down their faces. On the banks of the Gan River, proletarian revolutionary masses pinned Mao badges on their comrades' chests; by the shores of Poyang Lake, Red Guards wore the red armbands they received during Mao's inspection on their comrades' arms; on Jinggangshan, the old Red Guards who fought side by side with the Red Army presented red rice, pumpkins, and Jinggang tea to the young soldiers, saying with deep emotion: "In the past, Comrade Mao drank this Jinggang tea and led the Red Army to eat red rice and pumpkin meals. Today, we present it to you to express the sentiments of the old generation of Jinggangshan people."

In the revolutionary war years, the exemplary discipline and love-for-the-people platoon, which was closely connected with the people, followed Chairman Mao's teachings today and came to Pingxiang.

At that time, Pingxiang was under white terror. Deputy commander Yang Wanming led the exemplary discipline and love-for-the-people platoon to day and night unite and fight with the proletarian revolutionary masses. They armed them with Mao Zedong Thought on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, theory, line, policy, and principles, and became their steadfast rear guard. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to educate the deceived masses, winning them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The military loved the people, and the people supported the military. The proletarian revolutionary masses in Pingxiang fully supported the exemplary discipline and love-for-the-people platoon. When the soldiers needed to understand the situation of the fierce struggle between the two lines in the locality, they bravely took the initiative to visit homes, discuss issues, give speeches, and deliver leaflets and newspapers to their comrades. The platoon set up a reception station for the masses, and they volunteered, worked tirelessly, and served as assistants to the soldiers. When the class enemies spread rumors and slanders, attempting to sow discord between the military and the people, they stood up, exposed the enemy's tricks, and educated the masses to firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army.

In Jiangxi, such touching scenes of military and civilian unity and joint struggle are everywhere:

On the banks of the Fu River, a platoon leader from a certain unit was injured on duty and fainted, asking for water. When there was no hot water at the moment, Xu Mengjiao, the mother of four children, bravely squeezed out her breast milk, feeding it mouthful by mouthful to her comrade. The soldiers on the scene were moved to tears by this deep affection.

In the eastern mountains of Jiangxi, a proletarian revolutionary fighter overworked, causing a stomach wall rupture and severe bleeding. Soldiers from the Second Mechanized Company of a certain unit rushed to the hospital, demanding a blood transfusion. When the doctor said they needed type B blood, Corporal Cao Huaicheng stepped forward, saying, "My blood is type B!" His blood flowed into the veins of the revolutionary fighter who had fought side by side with him.

At the foot of Mount Lu, a group of proletarian revolutionary fighters from a factory were driven out by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Sergeant Gu Hongsheng and soldiers from the Eighth Company of a certain unit, fearing no risks, escorted the revolutionary comrades back into the factory, uniting and fighting with them, rapidly expanding and strengthening the revolutionary ranks. The revolutionary masses called Gu Hongsheng the "Red Flag of Supporting the Left."

In the cities and countryside of southern Jiangxi, Deputy Political Commissar Wang Xicai, at the most critical moment of class struggle, disregarded personal safety, with the help of revolutionary masses, broke through the numerous obstacles set by the capitalist roaders within the Party, and penetrated into the deceived masses, spreading Chairman Mao's voice, winning them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, isolating the class enemies, and strengthening the revolutionary ranks.

The heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong wrote a magnificent song of supporting the military and loving the people with their lives and blood on the vast Gan River. The great commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Commander Lin Biao personally approved and awarded the Fourth Platoon the title of "Exemplary Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People," and Li Wenzhong the title of "Exemplary Person for Supporting the Left and Loving the People," setting a brilliant example for the military and civilians across the country.

Military-civilian unity based on Mao Zedong Thought has become an irresistible torrent, propelling the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward. The ranks of the proletarian revolutionary masses rapidly expanded and strengthened, and the traitors like Liu Shaoqi and their agents like Fang Zhiping were engulfed in the vast ocean of people's war.

Military-civilian unity based on Mao Zedong Thought promotes the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions

The great helmsman guides the ship, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao inspected North China, Central South China, East China, and personally visited Jiangxi, issuing a series of extremely important instructions. Chairman Mao's latest instructions greatly inspired the 22 million sons and daughters of Jinggangshan and the broad cadres and fighters on the front lines of "Three Supports and Two Militaries."

General Yang Dongliang of the Provincial Military Region and leaders at various levels, along with responsible comrades of revolutionary mass organizations, set out immediately, leading cadres and fighters and proletarian revolutionary masses. Teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams composed of military and civilians quickly spread across the province's cities, towns, and villages.

Tonggu County, known as "seeing mountains as soon as you open the door and climbing hills as soon as you go out," was previously blocked in every way by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party from hearing Chairman Mao's voice. Soldiers from the Fourth Company of a certain unit, along with more than a thousand revolutionary comrades, formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, day and night traveling through the mountains and valleys of this county. There was a deep forest covering dozens of square miles with only about a dozen households. Soldiers and Red Guards held high Chairman Mao's portraits and sang the song "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory," moving from one household to another. The soldiers propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions word for word; the Red Guards enthusiastically shared their personal experiences, praising the brilliance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They faithfully conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Under the Jinggangshan, the First Mechanized Company of a certain unit in Anfu County, to better propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, helped the proletarian revolutionary masses and poor and lower-middle peasants hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The entire company's cadres and soldiers spread throughout the county. In all 133 points across the county, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held everywhere, with men, women, old, and young enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The heroic sons and daughters of Jinggangshan and the Jiangxi garrison, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions in action.

"Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions." In Yushan County Cement Factory, the two revolutionary mass organizations were constantly fighting each other, and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism hindered the great unity of the revolution. The supporting-the-left personnel in the factory, following the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, helped the two revolutionary mass organizations hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, jointly criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and eliminating factionalism. They mobilized the masses to expose the crimes of factionalism, discuss the harm of factionalism, and root out the poisonous roots of factionalism, making factionalism as despised as a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat it. Deputy Platoon Leader Xia Chang'an and his comrades did a great deal of painstaking political and ideological work in helping the revolutionary masses overcome factionalism and achieve great unity of the revolution. A responsible comrade of a revolutionary mass organization had difficulty understanding the unity with another revolutionary mass organization. Xia Chang'an talked to him, the first time without success, the second time he went again. He was not afraid of repetition, not afraid of twists and turns, the third time, the fourth time, he talked to this responsible comrade ten times. Under the illumination of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, this factory quickly achieved great unity of the revolution.

The sons and daughters of Jinggangshan, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, regard helping the children of the army do a good job in the "Three Supports and Two Militaries" work and jointly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the best way to support the military. The Red Guards of Jiangxi Normal University sincerely proposed to the military training personnel at a "Supporting-the-Left Evaluation Meeting": military and political training should be combined with revolutionary education. This opinion greatly inspired the military training personnel. They restudied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the education revolution and, together with the revolutionary young people, revised the military training plan, making the education revolution flourish. The leading organ of the supporting-the-left troops in Nanchang quickly promoted their experience to the entire city, raising military and political training to a new level.

Military-civilian unity based on Mao Zedong Thought promotes the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In Jiangxi, the great criticism, great unity, and great combination of the revolution are advancing rapidly, and revolutionary committees are being established at all levels. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has deeply entered people's hearts, and people's spiritual outlook has never been as vibrant as it is today.

Military-civilian unity based on Mao Zedong Thought promotes the thought revolutionization of the proletarian revolutionary cadres who have taken power

With the birth of temporary power organs at all levels, a large number of revolutionary pioneers who were previously unknown were pushed to leadership positions. The representatives of the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary leading cadres shared power with them for the proletariat.

In this new situation, the People's Liberation Army, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, armed the proletarian revolutionary cadres who are in leadership positions with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. These proletarian revolutionary cadres proposed: "Learn from the People's Liberation Army, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, and ensure that the socialist mountains remain forever red!"

Revolutionary young fighter Xu Guirong was elected vice chairman when the Revolutionary Committee of Xingguo County was established. This telephone operator from the postal service, during the days of holding power, under the help of supporting-the-left personnel, continuously attacked the "self" character.

Last winter, the revolutionary masses recommended Xu Guirong as the head of the Revolutionary Committee of Xingguo County, and the former county committee secretary Zhang Fengxuan as the deputy head. Later, adjustments were made. Some revolutionary masses discussed: Why did Xu Guirong become the deputy? Xu Guirong heard this but did not speak. From her actions, Colonel Li Zhugeng of a certain unit and soldiers from the Fifth Company saw that she had selfish thoughts on this issue.

Li Zhugeng studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with Xu Guirong. When they studied "to fight selfishness and repudiate revisionism," Li Zhugeng meaningfully asked her: "Why didn't you speak when you heard the masses' discussion?" This sentence had a great impact on Xu Guirong. For several days, she used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, repeatedly compared and checked, discovering that after her position changed, she unknowingly nurtured selfish thoughts about personal prestige. She thoroughly excavated the "self" character hidden deep in her soul, like the People's Liberation Army, consciously going to the masses, exposing selfish thoughts, fighting selfish thoughts, and advancing on the road of thought revolutionization.

In the great storm of class struggle, a new generation emerged, taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, turning Mao Zedong Thought into their soul, placing themselves among the masses; both being an official and a common person, creating a new revolutionary style.

In Yichun, the truck driver Luo Quanwang, who took the lead in rebelling against the capitalist roaders within the Party, became a member of the temporary leading group and often studied Chairman Mao's works with Political Commissar Wang Zhendong of a certain unit, went deep into the grassroots, listened to the masses' criticisms, and cared about the masses' lives. He learned from the People's Liberation Army's actual actions, acquiring the excellent style of blending with the masses and never leaving them.

In Jian, revolutionary pioneer Xiao Wenbian, after participating in the temporary power organ, humbly learned from the People's Liberation Army, cultivating the good style of discussing with the masses and being a student of the masses, uniting the majority of the masses to make the revolution together.

In Jiujiang, the temporary leading group of a certain factory, with the help of the supporting-the-left troops, achieved the revolutionization of the leading cadre, with one committee member responsible for daily work, and the rest all working shifts in the workshops, establishing a new type of cadre-mass relationship.

"Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The cadres and fighters, following Chairman Mao's teachings, vigorously propagated the army's political work experience to the proletarian revolutionary cadres, helping them establish a political work system, making them forever walk the road of highlighting politics.

The representatives of the People's Liberation Army participating in the revolutionary three-in-one combination and the broad cadres and fighters, in the days of helping the proletarian revolutionary cadres take power and use power, learned from the sons and daughters of Jinggangshan their sincere loyalty to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao without hesitation; learned their thorough revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win; learned their vigorous and close connection with the masses, promoting the thought revolutionization of the troops and the "Three Supports and Two Militaries" work.

In the activities of supporting the military and loving the people, the military and civilians of Jiangxi, filled with great enthusiasm, are determined to pour their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao into the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, truly achieving: Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; Chairman Mao instructs me, I act accordingly; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance!

    毛泽东思想基础上的军民团结
    ——记江西军民在无产阶级文化大革命中的战斗情谊
    今天，在革命老根据地江西，到处洋溢着军爱民，民拥军，军民团结，亲密无间的热烈气氛。英雄的井冈山儿女和人民子弟兵回顾无产阶级文化大革命一年多来共同战斗的历程时，迸发出一个共同声音：
    兵民是胜利之本。
    毛泽东思想基础上的军民团结，促进了毛主席最新指示的全面落实，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证。
    毛泽东思想基础上的军民团结，推动无产阶级文化大革命运动滚滚向前
    在江西两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战时刻，当年的红军战士率领英雄的部队，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，入赣支左。和党内一小撮走资派进行英勇搏斗的井冈山儿女，见到亲人，心潮澎湃热泪流。赣江边，无产阶级革命派把一枚枚毛主席像章挂在亲人的胸前；鄱阳湖畔，红卫兵小将把接受毛主席检阅时佩带的红袖章戴在亲人的手臂上；在井冈山上，当年与工农红军并肩作战的老赤卫队员，捧出红米、南瓜和井冈茶，送到年青的指战员手里，满怀深情地说：“当年毛委员喝过这井冈茶，带领红军吃过这红米南瓜饭，今天，把它送给你们，表表老一代井冈山人的心意。”
    在革命战争年代，与人民群众血肉相连的遵纪爱民模范连，今天遵照毛主席的教导，来到萍乡。
    那时的萍乡，处在白色恐怖中。团副参谋长杨万明带领遵纪爱民模范连的战士，昼夜同无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，用毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，武装他们，做他们的坚强后盾。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想教育受蒙蔽群众，争取他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。军爱民，民拥军。萍乡的无产阶级革命派全力以赴支持遵纪爱民模范连。战士们需要了解当地两条路线激烈搏斗的情况，他们甘冒风险，主动上门，谈问题，作报告，把一份份传单和报刊送到亲人手里。连队设立群众接待站，他们自告奋勇，废寝忘食，给战士当助手。当阶级敌人造谣中伤，妄图挑拨军民关系的时候，他们又挺身而出，揭露敌人的阴谋诡计，教育群众坚决相信和依靠人民解放军。
    在江西，到处是这样军民携手并肩，团结战斗的动人情景：
    在抚河岸边，某部指导员因公负伤，昏迷中要水喝。在一时找不到开水时，四个孩子的妈妈徐猛娇毅然挤出自己的奶汁，一口一口地喂亲人。在场的战士被这种深情感动得流下了热泪。
    在赣东山区，一个无产阶级革命派战士操劳过度，胃壁破裂，大量出血。某部二机连的战士火速赶到医院，要求输血。当医生说要B型血的时候，六班长曹怀成挤上前去，抢着说：“我的血是B型！”他的血流进了并肩战斗的革命派战士的血液里。
    在庐山脚下，一个工厂的一批无产阶级革命派战士被党内一小撮走资派赶出厂外。某部八连排长古宏胜和战士们，不怕风险，把革命派战友送回厂内，同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，使革命派队伍迅速发展壮大。革命群众称古宏胜为“支左红旗”。
    在赣南城乡，某部副政委王喜才，在阶级斗争最紧张的时刻，不顾个人安危，在革命群众帮助下，一次次冲破党内走资派设置的重重障碍，深入受蒙蔽群众之中，传播毛主席的声音，争取他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，孤立了阶级敌人，壮大了革命队伍。
    英雄四排和李文忠在滔滔赣江用生命和鲜血谱写出一曲拥军爱民的壮丽凯歌。伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副统帅亲自批准，授予四排以“支左爱民模范排”，李文忠以“支左爱民模范”称号，为全国军民树立了光辉榜样。
    毛泽东思想基础上的军民团结，汇成了势不可挡的洪流，推动无产阶级文化大革命运动滚滚向前。无产阶级革命派队伍迅速发展壮大，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人方志纯之流，陷于“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。
    毛泽东思想基础上的军民团结，促进毛主席最新指示的全面落实大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南、华东地区，亲临江西，作了一系列极为重要的指示。毛主席的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了两千二百万井冈山儿女和战斗在“三支”“两军”前线的广大指战员。
    省军区司令员杨栋梁和各级领导干部、革命群众组织负责人，闻风而动，带领指战员和无产阶级革命派出发了。一支支军民联合组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，迅速遍布全省城镇、乡村。
    被人们称为“开门见山、出门爬岭”的铜鼓县，过去，党内一小撮走资派百般封锁毛主席的声音。某部四连指战员同上千名革命派战友组成毛泽东思想宣传队，日夜奔波在这个县的崇山峻岭之中。有一片深山老林，方圆四五十里，只有十来户人家。战士和红卫兵小将高举毛主席画像，高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录歌，从这户走到那户。战士们原原本本地宣传毛主席的最新指示；红卫兵小将一遍又一遍地以自己的亲身体会畅谈毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的英明伟大。他们不折不扣地把毛主席最新指示传到贫下中农的心坎里。
    井冈山下的安福县，某部一机连为了更好地宣传毛主席的最新指示，帮助无产阶级革命派和贫下中农大办毛泽东思想学习班。全连干部战士撒遍全县各个角落。全县一百三十三个点上，到处办起了毛泽东思想学习班，男女老少热情学习毛主席的最新指示。
    英雄的井冈山儿女和江西驻军，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，把毛主席的最新指示落实在行动上。
    “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”玉山县水泥厂两个革命群众组织“内战”不休，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性阻碍了革命的大联合。驻厂支左人员遵照支左不支派的原则，帮助两个革命群众组织举办毛泽东思想学习班，共同斗私批修，围剿派性。他们发动群众，在“内战”过的现场，大摆派性罪状，大说派性危害，大挖派性毒根，把派性批得象过街老鼠，人人喊打。副指导员夏长安和他的战友，在帮助革命群众打倒派性，实现革命大联合的过程中，作了大量艰苦细致的思想政治工作。有个革命群众组织的负责人，对同另一个革命群众组织搞联合想不通，夏长安和他谈心，第一次不成，第二次又去。他不怕反复，不怕曲折，第三次，第四次，一直和这个负责人谈了十一次。在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，这个厂迅速实现了革命大联合。
    无限忠于毛主席的井冈山儿女，把帮助子弟兵做好“三支”“两军”工作，共同落实毛主席最新指示，作为最好的拥军。江西师范学院的红卫兵小将，在一次“支左讲评会”上，诚恳地向军训人员提出：军政训练要和教育革命相结合。这条意见给军训人员很大启发，他们重新学习了毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，和革命小将一起修订了军训计划，使教育革命蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。驻南昌支左部队领导机关把他们的经验迅速推广到全市，使军政训练提高到新的水平。
    毛泽东思想基础上的军民团结，促进了毛主席最新指示的全面落实。在江西，革命大批判轰轰烈烈，革命大联合滚滚向前，革命三结合飞速发展，各级革命委员会纷纷建立。战无不胜的毛泽东思想深入人心，人的精神面貌从来没有象今天这样焕发。
    毛泽东思想基础上的军民团结，促使掌权的无产阶级革命派实现思想革命化
    随着各级临时权力机构的诞生，一大批本来不出名的革命闯将，被推上了领导岗位。解放军代表和革命领导干部与他们共同为无产阶级掌权、用权。
    在这新的形势面前，无限忠于毛主席的人民解放军，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装处于领导岗位的无产阶级革命派。这些无产阶级革命派提出：“向解放军学习，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，保证社会主义江山永远鲜红！”
    革命小将徐桂英在兴国县成立革命委员会时当选为副主任。这位邮电局的话务员，在掌权的日子里，在支左人员帮助下，不断向“私”字进攻。
    去年冬天，革命群众推举徐桂英当县革命委员会筹备小组组长，原县委书记张凤选为副组长。后来作了调整。有些革命群众议论：为什么徐桂英当了副的？徐桂英听了没有吭声。从她的行动里，解放军某部科长李祝庆和五连战士，看出了她在这个问题上有私心杂念。
    李祝庆同徐桂英一起学习毛主席的最新指示。当学到“要斗私，批修”的时候，李祝庆意味深长地问她：“你听了群众的议论为什么不吭声？”这句话给了徐桂英很大震动。连续几天，她以毛泽东思想为武器，反复对照，反复检查，发现自己地位变化以后，考虑个人威信的私心杂念，不知不觉地在滋长。她狠挖了隐藏在灵魂深处的“私”字，象解放军那样，自觉地到群众中去，亮私心，斗私心，在思想革命化大道上不断前进。
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，涌现出来的一代新人，就这样以解放军为榜样，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，置身于群众之中；既当“官”，又当老百姓，出现一代革命新风。
    在宜春，带头造党内走资派反的汽车司机罗全旺，当了临时领导小组成员以后，经常和某部政委王振东一起学习毛主席著作，一起深入基层，倾听群众的批评，关心群众的生活。他从解放军的实际行动中，学得了和群众打成一片，一刻也不脱离群众的优良作风。
    在吉安，革命闯将肖文彪参加临时权力机构以后，虚心向解放军学习，养成了遇事和群众商量，甘当群众小学生的好作风，团结了大多数群众一道闹革命。
    在九江，某工厂的临时领导小组，在支左部队的帮助下，实现领导班子革命化，每天除一名委员负责日常工作外，其余全部在车间顶班作业，建立了新型的干群关系。
      “政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”指战员们遵照毛主席的教导，向无产阶级革命派大力传播部队政治工作经验，帮助他们建立政治工作制度，让他们永远走突出政治的道路。
    参加革命三结合的解放军代表和广大指战员，在帮助无产阶级革命派掌权用权的日子里，从井冈山儿女身上，学到了他们对毛主席赤胆忠心，紧跟毛主席寸步不离的崇高品质；学到了他们敢于斗争，敢于胜利的彻底革命精神；学到了他们朝气勃勃，密切联系群众的优良作风，促进了部队的思想革命化，促进了“三支”“两军”工作。
    在拥军爱民活动中，江西军民满怀豪情，决心把对毛主席的无限忠诚倾注在全面落实毛主席最新指示上，象英雄四排和李文忠那样，真正做到：毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！
