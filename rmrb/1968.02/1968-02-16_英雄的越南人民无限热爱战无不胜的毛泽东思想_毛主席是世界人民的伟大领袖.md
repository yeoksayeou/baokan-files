The heroic Vietnamese people fighting on the front lines of the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation have deeply felt the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. They love Chairman Mao's works immensely and hold the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the highest regard.

The Greatest Aid is Chairman Mao's Military Thought

Once, after an American air raid on a Vietnamese village, a farmer told a Chinese comrade, "We are extremely grateful for Chairman Mao's concern. The Chinese people are our strong rear guard, and Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world's people."

Vietnamese comrades often say that they particularly like to read "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong." A commander of the Vietnamese People's Army said, "The greatest aid the Chinese people have given to the Vietnamese people is Chairman Mao's military thought." An elderly Vietnamese woman took a Chinese comrade's hand and affectionately said, "Dear child, I can't read, but please find some books by Uncle Mao on warfare for my son in the army. He loves to read Uncle Mao's books." A Vietnamese teacher, pointing to Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Protracted War," said to a Chinese comrade, "Many of the views of the Vietnamese people's war come from this book. This book is very applicable to us."

We Believe in Mao Zedong Thought

A Vietnamese comrade wrote to a Chinese comrade, saying that many young people in Vietnam are studying Chairman Mao's works in various ways, such as listening to the radio, reading newspapers, and organizing discussion meetings. He said, "We absolutely believe in Mao Zedong Thought. Only Mao Zedong Thought can liberate all the people of the world."

The letter pointed out, "Mao Zedong Thought is like the sun of the East, illuminating our hearts, strengthening our revolutionary thoughts and will, and enhancing our fighting spirit to resist the aggressors of American imperialism and modern revisionism. The people of the world have recognized the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has shown the people of the world the truth, which is to fight against our common enemy, American imperialism."

Anti-American Soldiers Need to Master Mao Zedong Thought

A Vietnamese comrade, after receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," felt extremely happy and deeply moved. He solemnly called receiving this precious book "the highest award."

He wrote to the Chinese comrade who gave him the book, expressing sincere thanks. He said, "For a long time, I have yearned to get this book by Chairman Mao. I regard Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest and most powerful weapon to defeat our enemies—imperialism and modern revisionism. Especially as a soldier bravely standing on the front lines of the struggle against American aggression, I need to master Mao Zedong Thought more than ever."

He added, "The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are a powerful rear guard for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. With the spirit of self-reliance and unparalleled bravery, and with the full support of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, we will surely defeat the American aggressors completely."

Becoming Students and Soldiers of Chairman Mao

A Vietnamese youth wrote in a letter, "A heroic era's youth, from the land of heroic Vietnam that is ablaze with war, from the front lines of the decisive battle against American aggression, from the lines of victory in production, combat, and work, sends the most sincere and affectionate greetings to relatives—the Chinese comrades." In this letter full of revolutionary passion, he wrote, "Every time I listen to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's teachings from the Chinese radio station, the fighting language and the news of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution make my heart surge with an indescribable excitement. From the Chinese 'People's Pictorial,' I saw the beloved Uncle Mao in good health, radiant, and full of vigor, standing on Tiananmen reviewing the revolutionary army, and I felt very happy and fortunate. Every time I look up at Uncle Mao's portrait, I always express this wish: Dear Uncle Mao, you are the great leader of the world's people, you are the sun rising in my heart, you have shown me the way forward. I love you immensely, I vow to be your little student and soldier!"

Acting According to Chairman Mao's Teachings

Once, Chinese comrades went to a Vietnamese village to help the locals with irrigation during a drought. While working, they placed a plaque with Chairman Mao's quotations and a portrait of Chairman Mao in the field. Seeing Chairman Mao's portrait, a Vietnamese farmer hurriedly walked to the portrait and respectfully bowed. During a rest, the Vietnamese farmers studied Chairman Mao's quotations with the Chinese comrades. After reading the quotation "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," a farmer said, "Yes, now in our fight against the drought, we should be like Yu Gong, overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory." Some farmers also took some badges with Chairman Mao's quotations and expressed their determination to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

    英雄的越南人民无限热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    毛主席是世界人民的伟大领袖
    新华社十五日讯　战斗在抗美救国前线的英雄的越南人民，深刻体会到毛泽东思想的无穷威力。他们无限热爱毛主席著作，无限崇拜战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    最大的援助是毛主席的军事思想
    一次，遭受美机轰炸的越南一个村庄的一位农民对在越南的中国同志说：“我们非常感谢毛主席的关怀，中国人民是我们坚强的后盾，毛主席是世界人民伟大的领袖。”
    越南同志们经常说，他们特别喜欢读《毛泽东军事文选》。越南人民军一位指挥员说：“中国人民对越南人民的最大援助是毛主席的军事思想。”一位越南老大娘拉着中国同志的手，亲切地说：“好孩子，我不识字，你替大娘找一些毛伯伯关于打仗的书，给我在部队的儿子看。他最喜欢读毛伯伯的书。”一位越南教师指着毛主席的光辉著作《论持久战》对中国同志说：“越南人民战争的许多观点都来自这本书。这本书对我们太适用了。”
    我们信仰毛泽东思想
    越南一位战友写信告诉中国同志，越南许多青年人正在用各种形式，如听广播、读报、组织讨论会等，来学习毛主席著作。他说：“我们绝对信仰毛泽东思想，只有毛泽东思想才能使全世界人民得到解放。”
    来信指出：“毛泽东思想好象东方的太阳，照亮我们的心，坚定我们的革命思想和革命意志，增强我们反对美帝国主义侵略者、现代修正主义者的战斗毅力。世界人民认识到了毛泽东思想的伟大，毛泽东思想给全世界人民指出了一条真理，这就是必须同我们的共同敌人美帝国主义作斗争。”
    抗美战士需要掌握毛泽东思想
    一位越南同志在得到一本《毛主席语录》后，感到非常幸福，万分激动。他极为郑重地把得到这本宝书称作“最高的奖品”。
    他写信给送宝书给他的中国同志，表示真诚的感谢。他说：“很久以来我就渴望能得到毛主席的这本书了。我把毛泽东思想看作战胜我们的敌人——帝国主义和现代修正主义的最锐利和最强大的武器。尤其是作为正在英勇地站在抗美斗争最前线的一个战士，我比任何时候都更加需要掌握好毛泽东思想。”
    他又说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，是我们越南人民抗美救国斗争的强大后盾。有了自力更生和无比勇敢的精神，又得到中国人民和世界革命人民的全力援助，我们一定能够把美国侵略者彻底打败。”
    做毛主席的学生和战士
    一位越南青年的来信说：“一个英雄时代的知识青年，从正在燃烧着战火的英雄的越南国土上，从决战决胜的抗美救国前线，从胜利的生产、战斗和工作战线上，向亲人——中国同志致以最真挚和最亲切的问候。”他在这封充满革命激情的信中这样写道：“每当我收听到中国广播电台广播的毛主席的教导，那种战斗的语言和无产阶级文化大革命的胜利消息时，我心中总是沸腾着一种难以形容的激动的感情。从中国《人民画报》上，我看到了敬爱的毛伯伯身体非常健康，红光满面，神采奕奕，站在天安门上检阅革命大军，我感到非常高兴，非常幸福。每次仰望毛伯伯的像，我总要表示这样的心愿：敬爱的毛伯伯，您是世界人民的伟大领袖，您是我心中升起的太阳，您给我指出了前进的道路。我无限地敬爱您，我誓当您的一名小学生，一名战士！”
    按照毛主席的教导去做
    一次，中国同志到越南一个农村去帮助老乡抗旱浇地。干活的时候，他们把毛主席语录牌和毛主席像立在田头，一位越南农民见了毛主席像，连忙走到像前，恭恭敬敬地向毛主席像鞠了一躬。休息的时候，越南农民同中国同志一起学习毛主席语录。当他们读完了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这段语录时，一位农民说：“对，现在我们抗旱也要象愚公那样，排除万难去争取胜利。”有的农民还要去了一些毛主席语录章，并且表示一定要按照毛主席的教导去做。
