Last year, our brigade achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. However, after the harvest, a few cadres and commune members became complacent and slackened their efforts, paying little attention to preparations for this year's farming. Some cadres said, "Our brigade has enough grain, enough money, and plenty of labor. There's no rush for spring farming preparations." Some commune members also said, "It's still early for sowing. Why rush with preparations?"

The brigade leadership analyzed these thoughts and concluded that overcoming arrogance and complacency is key to achieving another bumper harvest this year. They organized cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions repeatedly and thoroughly. Through the study, most cadres and commune members said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that 'arrogance leads to backwardness.' If we become complacent and do not start early, even with strong labor force, we will fall behind."

Based on the improved understanding, each production team, considering the short "spring neck" and concentrated sowing time this year, specifically planned production tasks and implemented production measures, immediately launching a new wave of "revolutionizing and promoting production." Over 80% of the brigade's labor force participated in spring farming preparations and agricultural infrastructure construction. Fertilizer accumulation, manure transportation, seed selection, tool repair, canal dredging, and paddy field development were all carried out with great enthusiasm. The brigade's militia company organized over 190 core militia members to rush the construction of a water pumping station. During the work, the militia members studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carrying out revolutionary criticism, significantly speeding up the project progress. Now, the brigade has dredged over 1,200 meters of canals, not only accumulating a large amount of manure but also excavating over 5,000 cubic meters of river mud. Each production team is striving to quickly transport the manure to the fields.

    克服自满情绪搞好备耕工作
    去年，我们大队获得历史上少有的大丰收。但丰收后，有少数干部和社员却产生了自满松劲情绪，对今年的备耕生产抓得不紧。有的干部说：“咱队粮足、钱足、劳动力多，备耕生产不着忙。”也有的社员说：“离种地时间还早哩，备耕急啥！”大队领导班子分析了这些活思想，认为能否克服骄傲自满情绪，是夺取今年农业大丰收的关键。于是，组织干部和社员反复深入地学习了毛主席的有关指示。通过学习，广大干部和社员都说，毛主席教导我们：“骄傲使人落后”，如果我们思想麻痹，不及早动手，即使人强马壮也会赶不上趟的。
    在认识提高的基础上，各生产队根据今年
  “春脖子”短，播种时间集中的特点，具体安排了生产计划，落实了生产措施，立即掀起了抓革命促生产的新高潮。全大队百分之八十以上的劳动力投入了备耕生产和农田基本建设。积肥、送粪、选种、整修农具、修水渠、开发水田，样样搞得热火朝天。大队民兵连组织了一百九十多名基干民兵，突击修建扬水站，在劳动中，民兵们大学大用毛主席的最新指示，开展革命的大批判，大大地加速了工程进度。现在，全大队已修水渠一千二百多米，不仅积了大量的粪肥，还挖了五千多立方米的河泥，各生产队都在争取尽快地把粪肥送到地里。
