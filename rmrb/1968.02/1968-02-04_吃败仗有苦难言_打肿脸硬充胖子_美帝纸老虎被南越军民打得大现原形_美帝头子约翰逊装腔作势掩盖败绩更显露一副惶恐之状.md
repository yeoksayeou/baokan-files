The U.S. imperialist paper tiger has been exposed by the South Vietnamese military and people, and U.S. President Johnson's attempts to cover up the defeat only reveal his panic.

BEIJING, Feb. 3 (Xinhua) — The U.S. imperialist head, Johnson, who has been thrown into confusion and disarray by the all-out offensive of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, has been making speeches in Washington in recent days in an attempt to cover up his defeat and "stabilize public opinion." At the same time, he is playing war tricks and actively plotting new measures to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam, in a desperate attempt to make a final struggle.

After several sleepless nights and intense plotting, the still-shaken Johnson held a press conference on February 2, feigning composure and desperately trying to hide his terrified state of mind. He attempted to downplay the heavy blows suffered by the U.S. aggressors in various battlefields in South Vietnam over the past few days, and to dilute the brilliant victories achieved by the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the battles, claiming that the fierce and all-out offensive by the South Vietnamese military and people against the U.S.-puppet forces was merely "a riot in a city." At the same time, due to the brilliant victories of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, the U.S. paper tiger's true colors have been further exposed, and all the boasts and lies the U.S. has made about the war of aggression against Vietnam in the past have been thoroughly bankrupt. He had to admit in a low voice that "the situation is unstable," and that "at this crucial stage, I would rather sing a low tune and not make any hollow promises."

Johnson's speech at the press conference shows that the U.S. imperialist aggressors, who have suffered unprecedented heavy blows and fallen into unprecedented serious difficulties, are still not giving up and are attempting to make a more desperate final struggle. He claimed to "ensure" that the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, "gets everything he thinks he needs at this time," and said that he "does not rule out" the possibility of taking any action to change the original plan to send more troops to South Vietnam, and shouted that "anything can happen immediately."

According to reports, to cope with the "emergency situation" in South Vietnam, the U.S. government has canceled all rest and leave for its military personnel in Southeast Asia and ordered all U.S. bases in Thailand to be on full alert.

While holding frequent meetings with U.S. military and political leaders and two-party politicians to plot new measures to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam, Johnson also tried to use the "bombing halt" to play a "stalling game" in a speech on February 1. He shouted that unless there are "some better signs" in the "peace talks," the U.S. will not only not stop bombing North Vietnam but will also strengthen the bombing of the North. Johnson's remarks fully show that the U.S. imperialists, facing the strong offensive of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the South, are at a loss, and once again resort to the old trick of "bombing to force peace."

Despite Johnson's desperate attempts to cover up the defeat and advocate for more desperate struggles, he still cannot alleviate the panic and anxiety of the U.S. ruling class. A February 2 report by Agence France-Presse in Washington said that the brilliant victories of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam have left Washington stunned and worried. Senate Democratic leader Mansfield said that U.S. senators are "frustrated, anxious, and disappointed" about what is happening and their inability to cope. He urged Johnson to "reassess" the "entire situation" of the U.S. in the war of aggression against Vietnam.

Senator Percy admitted that the People's Liberation Armed Forces had achieved great victories. He anxiously said that the People's Liberation Armed Forces "can fight at any time and place they choose," and that "the fact that they can launch so many attacks proves that they have great power," far stronger than what the U.S. government tries to make the American people believe. It is "impossible" for the U.S. to defeat them.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright also admitted in despair that the U.S. military in South Vietnam is surrounded by the people, and that the heavy blows suffered by the U.S. military in the South Vietnamese battlefield are a fate that is bound to befall them.

    吃败仗有苦难言　打肿脸硬充胖子
    美帝纸老虎被南越军民打得大现原形
    美帝头子约翰逊装腔作势掩盖败绩更显露一副惶恐之状
    新华社三日讯　被越南南方人民解放武装力量的全面出击打得晕头转向，手足无措的美帝头子约翰逊，连日来不断在华盛顿发表谈话，妄图掩盖败绩，“稳定人心”；同时，他又大肆玩弄战争讹诈，积极策划强化侵越战争的新措施，阴谋进行更加疯狂的垂死挣扎。
    在度过了几个不眠之夜并经过一番紧张的密谋策划之后，惊魂未定的约翰逊在二日举行的记者招待会上故作镇静，竭力掩盖他惶恐万状的心情。他极力缩小美国侵略者这几天在南越各个战场上所遭受的沉重打击，冲淡南方人民解放武装力量在战斗中取得的无比辉煌的胜利，说什么越南南方军民对美伪军的猛烈和全面的出击，只不过象“在一个城市中发生了一场骚乱”；同时，由于人民解放武装力量的辉煌胜利进一步戳穿了美帝纸老虎的原形，美国过去就侵越战争吹下的种种牛皮和散布的种种谎言彻底破产，他又不得不语调低沉地承认“局势是动荡不定的”，“在这个非常紧要的阶段，我更愿意得多的还是唱低调，而不是提出任何空洞的保证”。
    约翰逊在记者招待会上的讲话表明，遭到空前沉重打击，陷入空前严重困境的美帝国主义侵略者仍然贼心不死，妄图进行更加疯狂的垂死挣扎。他声称要“务使”侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰“得到他此时认为所需要的每一样东西”，并且说，他“不想排除”在改变原来计划向南越实行更多增兵的问题上“采取任何行动的可能性”，并且叫嚷“任何事情都可以立即发生的”。
    据报道，为了应付在南越的“紧急局势”，美国政府取消了它在东南亚的军事人员的一切休息和休假，并且命令美国在泰国的全部基地普遍处于“戒备状态”。
    约翰逊连日来在同美国军政头目和两党政客举行频繁的会议，策划强化侵越战争新措施的同时，在一日的一次讲话中还妄图利用“停炸”来玩弄“缓兵计”。他叫嚷什么除非在
  “和谈”方面出现“好一些的迹象”，美国不仅不会停止对越南北方的轰炸，而且要加强对北方的轰炸。约翰逊这番话完全说明了美帝面对南方人民解放武装的强大攻势，束手无策，而再一次乞灵于“以炸迫和”的故伎。
    尽管约翰逊极力掩盖败绩和鼓吹进行更加疯狂的挣扎，但仍然无法减弱美国统治集团的惊慌不安。法新社驻华盛顿记者二日指出，越南南方人民解放武装力量取得的光辉胜利使华盛顿目瞪口呆，愁眉苦脸。参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德说，美国参议员们“对正在发生的事情以及自己无力对付感到心烦、不安和失望”。他要求约翰逊“重新估计”美国在侵越战争中的“整个情况”。
    参议员珀西承认人民解放武装力量取得了巨大胜利。他不安地说，人民解放武装力量“能够在他们所选择的任何时候、任何地方打”，“他们可以发动他们所发动的那么多的进攻这一事实证明，他们有着巨大的力量”，比美国政府企图使美国人民相信的远为强大。美国要想打败他们“是不可能的”。
    参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特也沮丧地承认：美国军队在越南南方受到人民的重重包围，美国军队在南越战场上受到的沉重打击，是注定要遭到的命运。
