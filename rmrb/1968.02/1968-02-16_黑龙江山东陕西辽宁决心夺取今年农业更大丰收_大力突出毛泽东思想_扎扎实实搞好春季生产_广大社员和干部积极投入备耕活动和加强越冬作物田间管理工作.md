Heilongjiang, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Liaoning are determined to achieve greater agricultural harvests this year. They are vigorously emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly carrying out spring production, and actively engaging in spring plowing activities while strengthening the management of winter crops.

Heilongjiang

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 15th: The Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Heilongjiang Military Region held a radio conference on February 10th, calling on all the poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary workers of state farms, and revolutionary cadres in the province's rural people's communes to take immediate action, seize the revolution, promote production, and launch a spring plowing and production campaign. They aim to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and realize a greater agricultural harvest in 1968.

Comrade Pan Fusheng, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, addressed the conference.

Currently, the situation in Heilongjiang's rural areas is excellent and improving. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary workers of state farms, revolutionary cadres, and militiamen, with deep class feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, and transforming everything. The battle-ready Mao Zedong Thought has further penetrated people's hearts. Especially after the dissemination and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, various places have responded swiftly, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have used these study classes as battlegrounds for criticizing and repudiating revisionism, significantly raising their class consciousness. They deeply understand that, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, starting from promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, doing a good job in spring plowing preparations, and ensuring greater development in agricultural production this year, this is of great significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of cadres and community members are united in heart and effort, seizing the revolution and promoting production. Various places are vigorously engaged in activities such as fertilizing, repairing tractors, selecting seeds, and water conservancy projects, creating a bustling scene.

Chairman Mao taught us in 1945: "Currently, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and the masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year." The radio conference pointed out that Chairman Mao's teachings are equally important in the current context. The conference requires all levels of revolutionary committees to strengthen their leadership over spring plowing and production preparations in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. They must mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and do a better job in spring plowing preparations. Rural areas should, before spring plowing, establish complete leadership teams at the grassroots level to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. Each place should assign more than half of the cadres to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the countryside, propagate, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. All sectors should vigorously support agriculture and wholeheartedly serve agriculture. Industrial departments should expedite the production of agricultural machinery, irrigation equipment, and spare parts, and organize technical service teams to help with the repair of agricultural machinery. Financial and commercial departments should ensure the supply of production materials needed for spring plowing and guarantee the needs of spring plowing. Transportation departments should prioritize the transportation of all materials needed for spring plowing. Efforts should be made to transport urban manure to the countryside to contribute to achieving a greater agricultural harvest this year.

Shandong

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 14th: The various levels of leadership organs and the broad masses of rural people's communes in Shandong Province are using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide the spring plowing preparations, launching a wave of spring plowing activities.

Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in Shandong's vast rural areas is excellent. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is surging forward. The entire province has established 480,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes of various types, with 15 million people participating in the study. Fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, people's ideological awareness has been greatly enhanced, and the idea of farming for the revolution has been further established. The broad masses of community members and revolutionary cadres fully recognize that doing a good job in spring plowing production and striving for a greater agricultural harvest this year is of great significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ensuring the successful completion of the Third Five-Year Plan, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, the enthusiasm for spring plowing has been greatly aroused. While actively preparing for spring plowing, various places are also strengthening the field management of winter crops. In the suburbs of Qingdao, 200,000 mu of wheat has had fertilizer applied to 80% of the fields.

The broad revolutionary cadres in Shandong's rural areas, tempered and tested by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are actively engaged in spring plowing work. They have replaced "self" with "public," replaced "fear" with "dare," and replaced believing in themselves with believing in the masses. They bravely take to the front lines of revolution and production, daring to lead. The new and old cadres of San Guanmiao People's Commune in Linyi County actively go deep into various production teams, helping the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to study and implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "seizing the revolution and promoting production," formulate annual production plans, and take the lead in participating in labor, working together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to break stones, clear silt, repair water channels, and fix agricultural machinery.

Shaanxi

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 15th: The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shaanxi's rural areas, riding the momentum of the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing every moment" and high revolutionary enthusiasm, have launched a spring production campaign. Currently, from south of the Qinling Mountains to north of the Great Wall, from the Guanzhong Plain to the Shaanbei Plateau, everywhere is a scene of vigorously seizing the revolution, vigorously promoting production, and vigorously preparing for spring plowing.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various places in Shaanxi Province regard the extensive study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as powerful ideological weapons for seizing the revolution, promoting production, and doing a good job in this year's spring plowing preparations. They believe that to do a good job in spring plowing preparations, the most important thing is to arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought. With the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, many counties, communes, and production teams have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Many counties and communes have also convened three-level cadre meetings and poor and lower-middle peasant representative meetings, summarizing and exchanging experiences in seizing the revolution and promoting production, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by Chinese Khrushchev, overthrowing factionalism, enhancing proletarian party spirit, and further igniting the firm confidence of the broad revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to achieve victory in both revolution and production. After achieving revolutionary great unity in eleven communes in Wugong County, the revolution is booming, and spring production is bustling, creating a spring production campaign centered on fertilizing, preparing for spring plowing, and managing summer crops in the fields.

Liaoning

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 14th: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," Liaoning Province, which achieved an all-around bumper harvest last year, has once again relatively early seen a spring plowing production campaign that is both vigorous and solid.

Under the influence of a good revolutionary situation, spring plowing production in the entire province is bustling. In the countryside, as soon as the east begins to brighten, groups of people start moving to collect fertilizer and transport manure. In the icy and snowy weather, everywhere you can see community members leveling land or working on water conservancy supporting projects. The work of selecting and exchanging high-quality seeds has been basically completed, and the prepared seeds are more abundant and better than in previous years. Facing a prosperous scene, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are full of confidence, determined to fire the first shot of spring plowing production and achieve a greater agricultural harvest this year.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army's agricultural support troops, Liaoning Province started spring plowing preparations relatively early this year, grasped them tightly, and carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and the Daqing spirit. As soon as the autumn harvest last year was over, various places began preparations to strive for a greater harvest this year. Before and after the New Year, various places formed a mass spring plowing production campaign centered on collecting fertilizer and transporting manure. Currently, in the relatively early season of the southern part of Liaoning, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have already transported manure to the fields; in the northern part of Liaoning and other places, most of the manure has been transported, and the progress is generally faster than the same period last year. The province's agricultural land construction has seriously implemented the policy of prioritizing small-scale projects, waging a "people's war." Since winter, the number of people working on water conservancy projects in the province has reached a daily peak of over 120,000. According to incomplete statistics, 64 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been moved, 240,000 mu of terraced fields have been newly built, nearly 50,000 mu of check-dam fields have been built, 1,700 wells have been dug, and 470 small reservoirs and dams have been built.

    黑龙江
    据新华社哈尔滨十五日电　黑龙江省革命委员会和黑龙江省军区在二月十日召开广播大会，号召全省农村人民公社广大贫下中农社员、国营农场革命职工、革命干部，立即行动起来，抓革命、促生产，掀起春耕春耕生产高潮，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为实现一九六八年农业生产更大丰收而奋斗。
    黑龙江省革命委员会主任委员潘复生同志在大会上讲了话。
    当前，黑龙江省农村形势一派大好，越来越好。广大贫下中农社员、国营农场革命职工、革命干部和民兵，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，改造一切，战无不胜的毛泽东思想进一步深入人心。特别是毛主席一系列最新指示传达贯彻以后，各地闻风而动，毛泽东思想学习班象雨后春笋一样遍地开花。广大贫下中农和革命干部，把学习班作为斗私批修的战场，阶级觉悟大大提高。他们深刻地认识到，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，从促进人的思想革命化入手，抓好备耕工作，保证今年农业生产有更大的发展，这对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，具有重大意义。广大干部、社员一条心，一股劲，抓革命，促生产，各地积肥送粪、检修拖拉机、精选种籽、兴修水利等备耕生产活动搞得热火朝天。
    毛主席在一九四五年教导我们：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”广播大会指出，毛主席的这一教导，在当前同样有着极为重要的现实意义。大会要求各级革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，加强对备耕、春耕生产的领导。要放手发动群众，依靠群众，把春耕准备工作做得更好。农村要在春耕前，把基层单位的领导班子健全起来，挑起革命和生产两副重担。各地要抽调一半以上干部，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农村，宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示。各行各业要大力支援农业，全心全意地为农业服务。工业部门要抓紧农机具、排灌设备和配件生产，并组织技术服务队，帮助搞好农机具检修。财贸和物资部门要做好春耕生产急需的生产资料的供应工作，保证春耕需要。交通运输部门要优先运送春耕生产的一切物资。搞好城粪下乡，为夺取今年农业更大丰收贡献力量。
    山东
    据新华社济南十四日电　山东省各级领导机关和广大农村人民公社社员用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅春耕准备工作，正在掀起备耕热潮。
    目前，山东广大农村革命和生产形势一片大好。活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动正波澜壮阔地向前发展。全省农村已经开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班四十八万个，有一千五百万人参加了学习。全面落实毛主席的最新指示，人的思想觉悟大大提高，进一步树立了为革命种田的思想。广大社员和革命干部充分认识到，搞好春耕生产，争取今年农业的更大丰收，对于夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利，对于保证第三个五年计划的胜利完成，对于巩固无产阶级专政，都有着极为重要的意义。因而，备耕的积极性大大调动起来了。在积极备耕的同时，各地还加强越冬作物的田间管理。青岛郊区的二十余万亩小麦，百分之八十追施了肥料。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼和考验的山东农村广大革命干部，积极投入备耕工作。他们把“私”字换成“公”字，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把相信自己换成相信群众，勇敢地走上革命、生产第一线，大胆地进行领导。临沂县三官庙公社的新老干部积极深入到各个生产队，帮助广大贫下中农学习和落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，制订全年生产计划，并带头参加劳动，和广大贫下中农一起，打石头、清淤土、修水渠、修理农机具。
    陕西
    据新华社西安十五日电　陕西省农村广大贫下中农和革命干部，乘无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好的东风，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神和高昂的革命干劲，掀起了春季生产热潮。目前，从秦岭南北到长城内外，从关中平原到陕北高原，到处是一片大抓革命，猛促生产，大搞春耕准备的热气腾腾的景象。
    陕西省各地的广大贫下中农和革命干部把大学大用毛主席著作和全面落实毛主席最新指示，作为抓革命，促生产，搞好今年备耕工作的强大思想武器。他们认为，要搞好备耕工作，千重要，万重要，最重要的是用毛泽东思想来武装人的头脑。在人民解放军的支持和协助下，许多县、社、队举办了毛泽东思想学习班，不少县、社还召开了有贫下中农参加的三级干部会议和贫下中农代表会，总结交流抓革命，促生产的经验，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫散布的反革命修正主义流毒，打倒派性，增强无产阶级党性，更加激发起广大革命干部和贫下中农夺取革命、生产双胜利的坚强信心。武功县的十一个公社实现了革命大联合以后，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，春季生产搞得热气腾腾，出现了一个以积肥备耕和夏收作物田间管理为中心的春季生产热潮。
    辽宁  
    据新华社沈阳十四日电　在毛主席一系列最新指示和“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指引下，去年获得全面大丰收的辽宁省广大农村，今年又比较早地出现了既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的备耕生产高潮。
    在一派大好革命形势的带动下，全省农村备耕生产搞得热气腾腾。在农村里，每天东方刚刚发白，积肥、送粪的人群就纷纷出动。冰天雪地里，到处有社员群众在平整土地或进行水利配套工程。各地选种和串换良种的工作已经基本完成，准备的种子比往年足，比往年好。面对一片兴旺的景象，广大贫下中农满怀信心，决心打响春耕生产第一炮，夺取今年农业的更大丰收。
    在人民解放军支农部队的帮助下，辽宁省今年备耕生产开始较早，抓得较紧，并且发扬了依靠群众，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的大寨精神。去年秋收刚刚结束，各地就为争取今年更大丰收进行准备。新年前后，各地以积肥送粪为中心的群众性备耕生产高潮就已先后形成。目前，在季节较早的辽南地区，广大贫下中农早已把粪肥送到地里；辽北等地粪肥也已大部送完，进度一般都快于去年同期。全省的农田基本建设，认真贯彻了小型为主的方针，打了一场“人民战争”。入冬以来，全省水利出工的人数每天最高达一百二十多万人。据不完全统计，已完成土石方六千四百多万立米，新修梯田二十四万亩，台条田近五万亩，打井一千七百多眼，修小水库塘坝四百七十多座。
