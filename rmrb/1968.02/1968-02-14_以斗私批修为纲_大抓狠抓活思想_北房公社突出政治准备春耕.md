The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in North Room Commune, Huairou County, Beijing, have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." With the help of the local leftist military unit, they have taken "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" as the main task, emphasized proletarian politics, resolutely addressed living thoughts, and ensured that the preparations for spring plowing are solid and thorough.

Last year, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this commune, under the guidance of the thought of Mao Zedong and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, achieved a double victory in revolution and production. At the beginning of this year, the leading cadres of the commune and the leftist military unit studied together the New Year's editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. Everyone recognized that doing a good job in agricultural production is an important task for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and an important aspect of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The key to a good year lies in the spring, and doing a good job in spring plowing preparations is a crucial link in agricultural production. Everyone agreed that among all preparations, emphasizing proletarian politics, resolutely addressing living thoughts, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the most fundamental preparation.

To do a good job in spring plowing preparations, the obstacles in front of us are: from the commune to the production teams, some cadres have different degrees of "fear," "difficulty," and "grievance." They are afraid of making mistakes as cadres, hurting people, and suffering losses; they are worried that the members will not obey the leadership, making it difficult to do the work, and if it doesn't work out, a year of hard work will be in vain. Therefore, some brigade and production team leadership teams have not been established for a long time, affecting revolution and production. Facing this situation, with the help of the leftist military unit, the commune held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," struggling against self and criticizing revisionism, recalling and comparing, and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev, the class awareness of cadres at all levels has been greatly aroused. At the same time, through painstaking and meticulous ideological and political work, the broad masses of cadres have shed the "fear," established the "dare," overcome the "difficulty," and strengthened their revolutionary faith; eliminated the "grievance," and established the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. Revolutionary cadres unanimously expressed that they will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, take power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, use power for the people, and be good servants of the people.

Some people see more unfavorable conditions, worry that production will not be good, and lack confidence in achieving a bumper harvest this year. Studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "the overall situation is better than ever before" and his teachings on daring to struggle and daring to win have strengthened the confidence of the cadres. Some cadres have the idea of "the old routine," thinking that "production, spring sowing, autumn harvest, it's the same every year," and do not pay enough attention to this year's spring plowing production. Some members think that since last year was a good harvest, this year will be even better, and they are complacent. Facing these living thoughts, the study classes held by the commune, brigade, and production team have studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "not fighting unprepared battles, not fighting battles without assurance," explained that the spring plowing production season is strong, and if one is slightly negligent, one will suffer a big loss, and timely sounded the alarm to change their incorrect views. Because the ideological problems were well solved, the policy of "grasp revolution and promote production" was well implemented. The leading cadres of the commune, in order to strengthen the inspection, supervision, and leadership of spring plowing production, divided into areas to take responsibility for the work, all went to the front line to live, eat, and work with the members, and solved problems in a timely manner. A production team had problems with its seeds, and after inspection, the germination rate was not high. After the commune cadres found out, they immediately arranged for the grain station to exchange seeds for this team. The leading cadres of the commune and the poor and lower-middle peasants together grasped revolution and promoted production, which further inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the members.

At present, the cadres at all levels of this commune and the poor and lower-middle peasants have actively studied the production plan and formulated production measures. The entire commune has launched a wave of fertilizer accumulation, transportation, and delivery, with carts pulling from far away and small carts pushing from near. Anjiazhuang Brigade has delivered fertilizer to all its spring sowing land this year. Now, the base fertilizer for spring sowing crops delivered to the fields by each brigade has reached more than 6,000 jin per mu. Each production team has done a good job in the four assurances for early maturing crops: mu number assurance, plot assurance, seed assurance, and fertilizer assurance. For dry land, they have done a good job in leveling the land, building ditches and ridges, and have done a good job in the inspection and maintenance of irrigation machinery, pumps, pipes, and belts. The entire commune has formulated a detailed and effective management plan for 11,000 mu of wheat. Many production teams in Beifang Brigade have done germination rate tests on spring wheat seeds, just waiting for the season to arrive and immediately sow. The members happily said: "No matter how difficult it is, as long as we emphasize proletarian politics and take Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, it will not be difficult. This year, we emphasize political preparation for spring plowing, which is better than any other year."

The entire unit of the Fourth Company of the 4887th Unit went to the rural areas of their stationed location to work with the poor and lower-middle peasants to do a good job in spring plowing production.

    以斗私批修为纲　大抓狠抓活思想
    北房公社突出政治准备春耕
    本报讯　北京市怀柔县北房公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在当地支左部队的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓革命，猛促生产，春耕准备工作做得扎扎实实。
    去年，这个公社广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在解放军的帮助下取得了革命、生产双丰收。今年一开始，公社领导干部和支左的解放军一起，反复学习了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论。大家认识到：抓好农业生产，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一项重要任务，是落实毛主席最新指示的一个重要方面。一年之计在于春，作好春耕准备工作，是搞好农业生产的关键一环。大家认为，千准备、万准备，突出无产阶级政治，大抓狠抓活思想，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，是最根本的准备。
    要搞好春耕准备工作，摆在面前的阻碍是：从公社到生产队有一部分干部存在程度不同的“怕”字、“难”字和“怨”字。怕当干部犯错误，“伤”人，吃亏；担心社员不服从领导，工作不好搞，万一搞不好，辛辛苦苦干一年，费力不讨好。因此，有些大队和生产队的领导班子迟迟不能建立起来，使革命和生产受到影响。针对这种情况，公社在支左部队的帮助下，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。各级干部通过大学毛主席的最新指示，大学“老五篇”，斗私批修，回忆对比和批判中国赫鲁晓夫，大大激发了阶级觉悟。同时经过艰苦细致的思想政治工作，使广大干部丢掉了“怕”字，树立了“敢”字；克服了“难”字，坚定了革命信心；消除了“怨”字，树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想。广大革命干部一致表示，一定听毛主席的话，为贫下中农掌好权、用好权，当好人民的勤务员。
    有的人看不利条件多，担心生产搞不好，对夺取今年农业大丰收的信心不足。学习班学习毛主席关于“整个形势比以往任何时候都好”的最新指示，学习毛主席敢于斗争、敢于胜利的教导，使干部们坚定了信心。还有个别干部有“老一套”的想法，认为“生产嘛，春播秋收，年年这么一套”，对今年春耕生产重视不够。还有的社员认为，去年丰收了，今年更没问题，思想麻痹。针对这些活思想，公社、大队、生产队举办的学习班，大学毛主席关于“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”的教导，讲清春耕生产季节性强，如果稍一疏忽，就会吃大亏，及时地给他们敲了警钟，改变了不正确的看法。由于思想问题解决得好，“抓革命，促生产”的方针贯彻得好。公社领导干部为了加强对春耕生产的检查、督促和领导，分片包干进行工作，全部下到第一线和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，发现问题及时解决。有一个生产队的种子有问题，经检查发芽率不高。公社干部发现后，立即向粮站给这个队调换了种子。公社领导干部和贫下中农一起抓革命促生产，更加鼓舞了社员的革命干劲。
    目前，这个公社的各级干部和贫下中农积极研究了生产计划，制订了生产措施。全公社掀起了一个积肥、起肥、送肥的热潮，远的大车拉，近的小车推。安各庄大队今年春播土地全部送上了肥料。现在各大队送到地里的春播作物底肥，每亩已达六千多斤。各生产队做好了早熟作物的四落实：亩数落实，地块落实，种子落实，肥料落实。对干旱的地块，作好了平整土地、修渠打畦，并做好了排灌机械的机、泵、管、带的检修准备工作。全社一万一千亩小麦，订出了详细有效的管理计划。北房大队的许多生产队把春大麦种子做了发芽率试验，只等季节一到，立即播种。社员们高兴地说：“千难万难，只要突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，就不难。今年突出政治备耕，比哪年做得都快、都细、都好。”
