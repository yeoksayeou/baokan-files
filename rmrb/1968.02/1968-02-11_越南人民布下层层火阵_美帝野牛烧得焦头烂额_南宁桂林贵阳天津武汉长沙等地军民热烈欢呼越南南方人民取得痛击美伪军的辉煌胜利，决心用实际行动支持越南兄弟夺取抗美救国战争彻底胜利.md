The Vietnamese people have laid down layer upon layer of fire barriers, and the U.S. imperialist bulls are burned to a crisp. The military and civilians in Nanning, Guilin, Guiyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Changsha have enthusiastically celebrated the resounding victory of the Vietnamese people in the South in their crushing defeat of the U.S. puppet forces, and have resolved to support their Vietnamese brothers in their struggle for a complete victory in the anti-U.S. national salvation war with concrete actions.

New China News Agency, February 10th: In recent days, the military and civilians in Nanning, Guilin, Guiyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Changsha have held meetings to enthusiastically celebrate the resounding victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the South in their crushing defeats of the U.S. puppet forces since the New Year, and to celebrate the victory of the people's war. They have expressed that the seven hundred million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people. They resolutely support the Vietnamese people in continuing to deliver more powerful and continuous blows to the U.S. puppet forces, aiming for a complete victory.

The various ethnic groups in Guangxi, which share mountains and rivers with Vietnam, were overjoyed and spread the news when they heard of the Vietnamese people in the South annihilating a large number of U.S. puppet forces since the New Year. The military and civilians in Nanning and Guilin held meetings to enthusiastically celebrate the resounding victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in the South, which shocked the world. Revolutionary students from the Guangxi Ethnic Institute, which has eleven ethnic groups, said at the victory celebration meeting that the U.S. imperialist bull has been burned to a crisp by the fire barriers laid down by the Vietnamese people and is in a state of panic. No matter what tricks the U.S., the Soviet revisionists, and the South Vietnamese reactionaries use, they cannot save themselves from their inevitable doom. The final victory will definitely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people. Representatives from the revolutionary workers, cadres, families, and Red Guards of the Nanning Railway Region said at the celebration meeting that the struggle of the Vietnamese people is our struggle, and their victory is our victory. We railway workers will definitely follow the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, complete the railway transportation tasks excellently, and support our Vietnamese brothers with concrete actions, vowing to be their strong rear guard. Vietnamese trainees who were invited to attend the celebration meeting introduced the glorious achievements of the Vietnamese military and civilians in the South and said that they believe that with the seven hundred million Chinese people as their strong rear guard, they will definitely achieve the final victory in the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle. Peasants from the Mingxiu Commune in the suburbs of Nanning said at the victory celebration meeting: We are located at the front line of supporting Vietnam and opposing the U.S. We peasants will definitely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasp the revolution, promote production, and quickly launch a spring plowing production campaign to support our Vietnamese brothers in continuing the anti-U.S. national salvation war to the end. Military representatives who attended various victory celebration meetings said that the great victory of the Vietnamese military and civilians in the South once again proved the correct judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The Vietnamese people have shown strong fighting will, high organizational discipline, and a fearless spirit of daring to fight and daring to win. We must learn from our heroic Vietnamese brothers.

The workers, revolutionary students, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guilin held a celebration meeting. The military representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guilin said at the victory celebration meeting that the great victory achieved by our Vietnamese brothers in the South has developed the Vietnamese people's war to a high level. The masses have been fully mobilized, and various patriotic forces have formed a vast revolutionary army, working closely with the liberation army to give the U.S. puppet forces a sound beating, annihilating a large number of enemy forces, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people of the world, and greatly dampening the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, setting a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations to achieve liberation. The representatives of Guilin workers and revolutionary students said in their speeches that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, build Guangxi into the most reliable rear base for Vietnam, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in continuing the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle to the end. Vietnamese friend Ly Van Kiet, who was invited to attend the celebration meeting, expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people for their support. He said that our anti-U.S. national salvation struggle will inevitably encounter many difficulties in the future, but the final victory will definitely belong to us.

Nearly ten thousand people from the revolutionary committees of the proletariat and the military region of Guizhou held a celebration meeting on the 8th. Xu Yingnian, a standing committee member of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee, said at the meeting that the New Year's great victory of the Vietnamese military and civilians in the South once again proved the most correct judgment of our great leader Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers," and once again demonstrated the great power of the people's war. We firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the Vietnamese people who continue to fight and become stronger. The Guizhou people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, together with the people of the whole country, will definitely be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people.

The heroic fighters, people's heroes, and heroic collectives of the 4688th Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin, who have previously clashed with U.S. imperialism, celebrated the New Year's great victory of the Vietnamese military and civilians in the South, laughing at the pathetic state of the U.S. paper tiger. They said that the victory of the Vietnamese people in the South shows that as long as the revolutionary people grasp the brilliant thoughts of the people's war, no matter how powerful, cunning, or brutal the enemy is, it can be suppressed, defeated, annihilated, and buried. The Vietnamese people, in the anti-U.S. national salvation war, have used the thoughts of the people's war to forge a real iron wall, developing the people's war to a high level. We firmly believe that our Vietnamese brothers in the South will definitely, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of "pursuing the fleeing enemy with remaining courage," drive the U.S. imperialists out of South Vietnam. In recent days, workers from the Tianjin Power Machinery Factory, students from Yan'an Middle School, peasants from the Sihuazhuang Production Brigade in Dongjiao District, and residents of the Hongwei District have held meetings with Vietnamese trainees in Tianjin to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of the Vietnamese people in the South.

The Wuhan Diesel Engine Factory, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Mechanical General Factory, Wuhan Heavy Machinery Factory, Wuhan Surveying and Mapping Institute, Huazhong Institute of Technology, and many other units have continued to hold meetings and various celebration activities in recent days. The broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary students have enthusiastically celebrated the great victory of our heroic Vietnamese brothers. They said at the victory celebration meetings that they would seriously learn from the great revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people who dare to fight and dare to win, fearing no sacrifice, grasp the revolution, promote production, and support our Vietnamese brothers with concrete actions, giving the U.S. imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries a heavier blow. Vietnamese trainees in Wuhan have also been extremely excited in recent days, celebrating the victory with the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat in Wuhan. They excitedly said that the New Year's great victory of the Vietnamese people is inseparable from the support of the people of the world, especially the great support of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao. Now, the three thousand one hundred million Vietnamese people are full of confidence and will definitely completely defeat the U.S. imperialist paper tiger.

The special communiqué issued by the Command of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces in the South has greatly encouraged the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hunan. The revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat from the Hunan Automobile Repair Company Changsha Repair Factory, Shaoshan Road People's Commune, and Changsha Railway Institute have held meetings to enthusiastically celebrate and congratulate the New Year's great victory of the Vietnamese military and civilians in the South. The representative of the revolutionary workers of the Hunan Automobile Repair Company Changsha Repair Factory said at the victory celebration meeting: The New Year's great victory of the Vietnamese military and civilians in the South has shown the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese people and set a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed nations to achieve liberation. We will definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people, and support them until they achieve the final victory. The team leader of the Vietnamese trainees in Hunan, Wu Shixing, also spoke at the meeting, expressing gratitude to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people for their greatest, most resolute, and most effective support for the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people. He said that the three thousand one hundred million Vietnamese people will definitely respond to the great call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, unite as one, "bravely advance to certain victory," and resolutely defeat the U.S. invading robbers, liberate the South, defend and build the North, and ultimately unify the country.
