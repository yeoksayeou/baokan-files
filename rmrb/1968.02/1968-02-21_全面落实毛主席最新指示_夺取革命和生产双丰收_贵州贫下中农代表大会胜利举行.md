According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou Province's Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representatives Conference was successfully held from February 10 to 15. This conference was a meeting for the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire province to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to unite and consolidate, and to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. It was also a mobilization meeting for the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire province to achieve even greater agricultural production this year.

During the conference, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a telegram to congratulate the conference on its success. When the central telegram was read at the conference, the more than 5,000 representatives from various ethnic groups of poor and lower-middle peasants shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The day after the central telegram was received, the representatives and 200,000 military and civilian people of the Guiyang area held a grand rally to express their gratitude for the great concern shown by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

The representatives attending the conference always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously studied, and repeatedly understood Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and actively applied Mao Zedong's works. They summarized and exchanged experiences in the Cultural Revolution in rural areas and in promoting production while carrying out the revolution. The representatives unanimously agreed that the situation in rural Guizhou, like the rest of the country, is excellent and getting better every day. Last year, they achieved double victories in revolution and production, with grain harvests reaching unprecedented levels in history. The fundamental experience in achieving double victories in revolution and production is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the socialist collectivization direction, and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide, transform, and promote everything. In the new year, they must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and arm the broad masses of community members with Mao Zedong Thought to carry out the ideological revolutionization of the people.

He called on the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the entire province to take immediate action and launch a high tide of spring plowing and production.
