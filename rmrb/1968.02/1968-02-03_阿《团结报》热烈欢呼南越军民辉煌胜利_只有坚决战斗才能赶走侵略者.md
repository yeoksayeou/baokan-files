The Albanian "Unity" Newspaper Warmly Celebrates the Brilliant Victories of the South Vietnamese Military and People

Only by resolutely fighting can the invaders be driven out

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana on February 2, the Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an editorial on February 2, warmly celebrating the brilliant victories achieved by the heroic South Vietnamese military and people in their recent powerful offensive against the American puppet forces.

The editorial said that the brilliant victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in the past year and in January of this year once again show that the Vietnamese people are steadfastly advancing on the road to victory. They believe that only through the weapons in their hands can they win freedom and independence, and drive the American aggressors and their lackeys out of their own country. The editorial said that these victories also show that the enemy, equipped with modern weapons, cannot intimidate the brave and tenacious Vietnamese people who are fighting for a just cause.

The editorial pointed out that the American imperialists, who have suffered repeated heavy blows and are in a desperate situation, are trying every means to salvage their inevitable failure in Vietnam. They are now colluding with Khrushchev, Wilson, Tito, Indira Gandhi, and others to loudly promote the bankrupt and infamous "peace talks" trick. However, no conspiracy or evil scheme can deceive the heroic Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people have become a shining example for the people who are fighting for freedom and independence and against imperialism and old and new colonialism.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Dar es Salaam on February 2, David Sibeko, the chief representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Dar es Salaam, issued a statement on February 2, warmly celebrating the brilliant victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people's liberation armed forces in their recent surprise attacks on Saigon and fierce assaults on various battlefields against the American puppet forces.

The statement emphasized that the attacks by the South Vietnamese people's liberation armed forces on the American "embassy," the puppet "presidential palace," the Saigon radio station, and other key departments of the American aggressors and their puppets, have confirmed the wise judgment made by Chairman Mao Zedong in his congratulatory telegram on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam: "Your victories once again show that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

The statement expressed the support of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania for the struggle of the Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country.

    阿《团结报》热烈欢呼南越军民辉煌胜利
    只有坚决战斗才能赶走侵略者
    据新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》一日发表社论，热烈欢呼英雄的越南南方军民连日来对美伪军发动强大攻势所取得的辉煌胜利。
    社论说，英雄的越南人民在去年和今年一月取得的辉煌胜利再次表明，越南人民正坚定不渝地在胜利的道路上前进。他们相信只有通过手中的武器才能赢得自由和独立，才能把美国侵略者及其走狗从自己的国土上赶出去。社论说，这些胜利同时表明，拥有现代化武器的敌人，吓不倒为正义事业而斗争的英勇顽强的越南人民。
    社论指出，遭到接二连三沉重打击、处于走投无路的美帝国主义者，正在千方百计地企图挽救它在越南的不可避免的失败。他们现在正在勾结柯西金、威尔逊、铁托、英迪拉·甘地等，大肆鼓吹破了产的和声名狼藉的“和谈”骗局。但是，任何阴谋和罪恶伎俩都蒙蔽不了英雄的越南人民。越南人民已经成为正在为争取自由和独立以及反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义而斗争的人民的光辉榜样。
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆一日电阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻达累斯萨拉姆首席代表戴维·西贝科一日在这里发表声明，热烈欢呼越南南方人民解放武装力量近日来奇袭西贡以及在各地战场上猛烈袭击美伪军而取得的辉煌胜利。
    声明强调说，越南南方人民解放武装力量对美国“大使馆”、伪“总统府”、西贡广播电台和美国侵略者及其傀儡的其他要害部门进行的袭击，证实了毛泽东主席在祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的贺电中所作出的英明论断：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    声明表示阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会支持越南人民解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国的斗争。
