More than 11,000 residents of Okinawa held a rally in Naha City on the night of the 6th, demanding that the United States immediately and unconditionally return Okinawa in its entirety and abolish nuclear bases. They vowed not to give up until their demands are met.

Over a thousand workers, youth, students, and women from all over Japan traveled by sea to participate in the rally.

According to reports from Okinawa-based newspapers, the chairperson of the Japanese Women's Association, Matsuoka Yōko, and other representatives unanimously emphasized the need to overthrow U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Sato government, and drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan. They also strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for secretly bringing more than ten B-52 bombers into the Kadena base.

The rally unanimously adopted a declaration and resolution. The declaration stated that the Japanese people demand that the U.S. government immediately and unconditionally return Okinawa in its entirety. The participants expressed their determination to strengthen unity and fight to the end to achieve this demand.

After the rally, the participants braved the rain to hold a demonstration march in the city center, chanting slogans such as "Return Okinawa!" and "Oppose the aggression against Vietnam!"
