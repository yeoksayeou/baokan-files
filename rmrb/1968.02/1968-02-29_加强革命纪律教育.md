The struggle against anarchism is an important aspect of the current sharp and complex class struggle. However, for the majority of the masses influenced by anarchist thinking, it remains a matter of ideological education and a matter of eliminating private interests and establishing public interests.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We will have to conduct a long-term struggle against the ideology of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. Not to understand this situation and to abandon ideological struggle is wrong."

To oppose anarchism, the correct approach is to actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen class education and discipline education, and help the masses understand from their own experiences that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, continuing the revolution requires strengthening proletarian revolutionary discipline and opposing anarchism. Any anarchist tendencies that undermine revolutionary discipline will only help the class enemy to undermine our proletarian dictatorship, weaken our socialist economic foundation, and disrupt the unity of our revolutionary ranks. Once the broad masses understand this truth, they will help and educate each other, distinguish right from wrong, correct mistakes, and enhance their awareness of observing revolutionary discipline.

Strengthening class education and raising the class consciousness of the masses is also an effective way to isolate and strike at a small handful of class enemies. Currently, a small handful of class enemies are using anarchism as a cover and revolutionary economism as bait to engage in various criminal activities, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. Through ideological education, we can free a part of the masses from the fog of anarchism, raise their consciousness, and open their eyes. The handful of class enemies hiding in the background will quickly become isolated and exposed in broad daylight.

Some people, under the pretext of "self-education," do not observe revolutionary discipline and do not obey correct management, doing whatever they want. This is anarchism and goes against Chairman Mao's teachings on the masses educating themselves. Regardless of the excuse, it is private interests at work, and if allowed to develop, it is very dangerous.

Emphasizing ideological education does not mean that cadres at all levels can relax administrative management work or fail to enforce strict revolutionary discipline. For anarchist behavior that harms revolutionary interests, if one does not feel indignant, does not advise, does not criticize, does not stop, and just lets it be, this shows that the cadre is still dominated by private interests and has not firmly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

All revolutionary cadres should, in the struggle to uphold revolutionary discipline and oppose anarchism, stand firmly with the majority of the masses, take the lead actively, manage boldly, and do thorough and detailed ideological and political work among the masses, guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology among the masses onto the track of proletarian revolution.

    加强革命纪律教育
    本报评论员
    反对无政府主义的斗争，是当前尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的一个重要方面。但是，对于大多数受无政府主义思潮影响的群众来说，仍然是一个思想教育问题，一个破私立公的问题。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。不了解这种情况，放弃思想斗争，那就是错误的。”
    反对无政府主义，正确的做法，只能是通过活学活用毛主席著作，加强阶级教育和纪律教育，使群众从自己的切身经验中，懂得在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命，必须加强无产阶级的革命纪律，反对无政府主义；任何破坏革命纪律的无政府主义倾向，只会帮助阶级敌人瓦解我们的无产阶级专政，削弱我们社会主义的经济基础，破坏我们革命队伍的团结。广大群众明白了这个道理，就会互相帮助，互相教育，明辨是非，纠正错误，提高遵守革命纪律的自觉性。
    加强阶级教育，提高群众的阶级觉悟，也是孤立和打击一小撮阶级敌人有效的方法。目前，一小撮阶级敌人正以无政府主义为掩护，以反革命经济主义为诱饵，进行种种罪恶活动，妄图达到他们颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的目的。我们通过思想教育，使一部分群众从无政府主义的迷雾中解放出来，他们的觉悟提高了，眼睛擦亮了，躲在幕后的一小撮阶级敌人就会迅速陷于孤立，暴露在光天化日之下。
    有些人，以“自己教育自己”为借口，不遵守革命纪律，不服从正确的管理，自己想怎么办就怎么办。他们这样做，就是在搞无政府主义，是同毛主席关于群众自己教育自己的教导，背道而驰的。不管什么借口，都是私心在作怪，发展下去，是很危险的。
    强调思想教育，绝不意味着各级干部可以放松行政管理工作，可以不执行严格的革命纪律。对损害革命利益的无政府主义行为，不愤恨，不劝告，不批评，不制止，听之任之，这恰恰说明这个干部还是“私”字当头，还没有坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上。
    一切革命的干部，在维护革命纪律、反对无政府主义的斗争中，应当旗帜鲜明地和大多数群众站在一起，积极领导，大胆管理，深入细致地对群众做思想政治工作，把群众中的小资产阶级思想，引上无产阶级革命的轨道。
