Following the black students in Warington, South Carolina, who bravely fought against violence for four consecutive nights starting February 5, black masses in other parts of the United States have risen in response. They held demonstrations and rallies to protest against the racial oppression of the American ruling class and bravely fought back against the fascist violence of the military police.

In New York, nearly a thousand black demonstrators marched around Madison Square Garden on the evening of the 16th, protesting the racial discrimination regulations of the New York Athletic Club for refusing to admit black members. They beat drums and shouted slogans to overthrow racism, demonstrating outside the stadium for five hours. Many poor whites also joined the demonstration. The demonstrators also carried coffins in their procession, expressing their angry protest against the fascist atrocity of the reactionary authorities in Warington, who opened fire on the demonstrating black students on February 8, killing three and injuring fifty. The demonstrators engaged in fierce struggles with the fascist police who came to suppress them, and some police were knocked to the ground. Thirteen demonstrators were arrested.

More than thirty famous black athletes who were invited to participate in the track and field event held by the New York Athletic Club refused to participate in the competition, expressing their protest against the club's racial discrimination against blacks.

In Durham, North Carolina, hundreds of black students held demonstrations to protest against the reactionary military police's shooting of black students in Warington, expressing their determination to avenge their murdered brothers. The demonstrating students also bravely fought with the police.

Students at the Agricultural Machinery Institute in Lorman, Mississippi, fought bravely against the fascist military police from the afternoon of the 20th to the dawn of the 21st. On the afternoon of the 20th, the students held a protest rally against the school administration's unreasonable expulsion of three students and suppression of students' political activities. The expelled students angrily denounced the school administration's persecution and suppression of their political activities. The school administration sent military police in armored cars to brutally suppress the students, and the military police also used tear gas to try to drive the students out of their dormitories. However, the students resisted tenaciously with bricks and glass bottles, and some students even bravely fired shots at the military police.

Facing the new wave of black anti-violence struggles, the American ruling class is extremely anxious. They are stepping up the use of both bribery and deception and bloody suppression, attempting to block the arrival of a greater black struggle storm. The head of the U.S. empire, Johnson, in his "Civil Rights Message" to Congress on January 24, hypocritically talked about "ending racial discrimination" and "not infringing upon human rights." However, his Secretary of the Army is sharpening his knives. According to reports, the Army has assigned 15,000 troops to support the National Guard in dealing with so-called "riots." Bulk supplies of riot control equipment such as body armor, searchlights, and tear gas are being transported to warehouses near major cities. The Department of Justice has announced plans to train military police nationwide to deal with "riots." Meanwhile, the New York authorities have arbitrarily arrested the young black leader Brown on trumped-up charges.

    抗议种族压迫  打倒种族主义
    美国黑人学生掀起新的英勇抗暴斗争
    各地黑人学生不畏强暴同法西斯军警英勇搏斗
    新华社二十四日讯　华盛顿消息：继南卡罗来纳州沃林季堡的黑人学生从二月五日起一连四个晚上坚持英勇的抗暴斗争之后，美国其他地方的黑人群众纷纷起来响应。他们举行示威和集会，抗议美国统治集团的种族压迫，并且对军警的法西斯暴行英勇地进行自卫还击。
    在纽约，近千名黑人示威者十六日晚上围着麦迪逊广场运动场游行示威，抗议纽约体育俱乐部拒绝吸收黑人成员的种族歧视的规定。他们敲着鼓，高喊着打倒种族主义的口号，在运动场外示威达五小时之久。许多贫苦白人也参加了示威的行列。示威者还抬着棺材游行，表示愤怒抗议二月八日反动当局在沃林季堡向示威的黑人学生开枪，打死三名、打伤五十名学生的法西斯暴行。示威群众同前来镇压的法西斯警察进行了激烈的搏斗，有些警察被打倒在地，十三名示威者被捕。
    被邀请参加纽约体育俱乐部举行的田径赛的三十多名著名黑人运动员拒绝参加比赛，表示抗议俱乐部对黑人的种族歧视。
    在北卡罗来纳州的达拉姆，数百名黑人学生举行示威，抗议反动军警在沃林季堡枪杀黑人学生的暴行，他们表示要为被杀害的弟兄报仇。示威学生也同警察进行了英勇搏斗。
    密西西比州洛布曼市黑人农业机械学院的学生，从二十日下午到二十一日黎明同法西斯军警进行了英勇的搏斗。二十日下午，学生们为反对校方无理开除三名学生和压制学生的政治活动举行了抗议集会，被开除的三名学生愤怒地控诉了校方对学生进行迫害、压制他们政治活动的罪行。校方用卡车运来头戴钢盔的军警对学生进行野蛮镇压，军警还使用催泪瓦斯企图把学生赶出宿舍，但是学生们用砖头和玻璃瓶等进行顽强的抵抗，有的学生还英勇地向军警开枪射击。
    面对着黑人抗暴斗争的新浪潮，美国统治集团感到焦虑万分。他们正在加紧使用笼络欺骗和血腥镇压的反革命两手，妄图阻挡更大的黑人斗争风暴的到来。美帝头子约翰逊在一月二十四日给国会提出的《民权咨文》中假惺惺地高谈什么“结束种族歧视”，“不得侵犯人权”，可是，他的陆军部长却在那里磨刀霍霍。据报道，陆军已经指派一万五千名军队支持国民警卫队去对付所谓“骚乱”。护胸甲、探照灯、催泪瓦斯等大批“控制骚乱”的装备正在运往各大城市附近的仓库。司法部已经宣布，计划在全国各地训练军警对付“骚乱”。与此同时，纽约当局已经以莫须有的罪名把美国黑人青年领袖布朗横加逮捕。
