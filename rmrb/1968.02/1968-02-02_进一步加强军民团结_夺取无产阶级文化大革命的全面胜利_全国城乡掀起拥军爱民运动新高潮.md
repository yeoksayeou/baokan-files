Further Strengthen Military-Civilian Unity to Achieve Comprehensive Victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

A New High Tide of Military-Civilian Unity Sweeps Across the Nation's Cities and Countryside

	Military and civilian personnel mutually visit each other, jointly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and together engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. They unanimously pledge to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to expose and criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, to strengthen proletarian party spirit, and to strive to consolidate and develop the revolutionary three-in-one combination and the revolutionary great alliance.

	Xinhua News Agency, February 1st: "Military-civilian unity is like one person, who can stand against us?" During the Spring Festival, revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers across the country, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "supporting the military and loving the people," have launched even more enthusiastic and extensive military-civilian unity activities, pushing the movement to a new high tide.

	In recent days, from cities to rural areas, from factories, shops, offices, schools to military bases, everywhere you can see the moving scenes of military and civilian personnel visiting each other, celebrating together, jointly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to further strengthen military-civilian unity, and to strive for comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Before and during the Spring Festival, provinces and autonomous regions such as Gansu, Henan, Guangxi, Tianjin, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Yunnan held military-civilian unity meetings or joint celebrations. At the military-civilian unity meeting held in Gansu Province, which recently established a revolutionary committee, Vice Chairman Hu Jizong of the Gansu Provincial Revolutionary Committee enthusiastically pointed out that every achievement made by Gansu Province in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a result of the hard work of the People's Liberation Army. We must take the PLA as our example, live to defend Mao Zedong Thought, and die to defend Mao Zedong Thought, determined to make Gansu Province a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. Commander Gao Weizeng of the Lanzhou Military Region expressed at the meeting that the soldiers and officers of the Lanzhou Military Region will further carry forward the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army loving the people, humbly learn from the revolutionary masses, strengthen military-civilian unity, and do a better job in the "three supports, two military" work. Liu Jianxun, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, at the joint military-civilian unity meeting held by the Henan Provincial and Zhengzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees, called on the people of the entire province to better learn from the People's Liberation Army, to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to expose and criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and to strive to consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. At the Spring Festival military-civilian joint celebration attended by more than 8,000 people in Nanning, Wei Youzhu, a member of the preparatory committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and a responsible person of the Guangxi Military Region, called on everyone to launch a "people's war" to expose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to guide their actions with proletarian party spirit, and to promote and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. At the military-civilian unity meeting attended by more than 6,000 people in Tianjin, Jie Xuegong, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, highly praised the "three supports, two military" work of the Tianjin garrison. Deputy Commander Zhu Biao of the Tianjin Garrison Command, representing the army, navy, and air force, expressed at the meeting that in the brilliant year of 1968, the Tianjin garrison will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better implement the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions," further improve the "three supports, two military" work, and achieve new merits for the people.

	"Without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people." With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, various places have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres emphasized during the Spring Festival military-civilian unity activities that the People's Liberation Army is an unparalleled heroic army. We support the military, fundamentally, by implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with the PLA comrades. We support the military by believing in, relying on, and supporting the PLA at all times; by learning from the PLA's unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; by doing everything possible to maintain the PLA's high prestige; by enhancing revolutionary vigilance and thoroughly smashing the enemy's plots to sabotage military-civilian unity; and by firmly supporting the PLA and further improving the "three supports, two military" work.

	In recent days, in the capital Beijing and the revolutionary base of Shanghai, many factories, rural areas, schools, offices, and neighborhoods have held military-civilian unity meetings and study sessions to learn from the PLA. Revolutionary masses expressed their determination to learn from the PLA's exemplary implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to launch a large-scale offensive against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and to further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. In the Guiyang region, factories, offices, schools, and rural people's communes formed more than 80 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, active in military bases and Guiyang streets, enthusiastically praising the PLA's outstanding contributions in the "three supports, two military" work and the deep affection between the military and the people. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yunkuan Brigade, Chaoyang People's Commune in the suburbs of Guiyang, actively invited local troops to help them set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes during military-civilian unity activities, further strengthening military-civilian relations. Some revolutionary mass organizations in Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, sent "military support pacts" to the PLA, expressing their determination to cherish military-civilian unity as they cherish their own eyes. In cities such as Shijiazhuang, Handan, Nanchang, Jinan, Qingdao, Chengdu, Chongqing, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, revolutionary masses revised their "military support pacts" during the Spring Festival and launched more extensive and in-depth activities to learn from the PLA. Many places also sent condolence teams and performance teams to visit local troops and families of martyrs and soldiers, presenting PLA comrades with portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao badges, making needle cases for them, and washing their clothes and bedding. The revolutionary affection between the military and the people was overflowing.

	The soldiers and officers of the various headquarters, military branches, and local garrisons of the People's Liberation Army, before and during the Spring Festival, seriously studied Chairman Mao's great instructions on "supporting the military and loving the people" and further revised their people-loving pacts. They all regarded propagating the great Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with the revolutionary masses as the greatest love for the people. Various units sent tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to factories, mines, rural areas, schools, and neighborhoods, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and launching a new high tide of people-loving activities. The 466th Unit of the PLA, where the model soldier Xie Sheng served, sent large batches of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams during the Spring Festival, braving the cold every day, walking dozens of miles, and knocking on doors to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and do good deeds for the people. They armed the local revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strengthened military-civilian unity, and promoted the revolutionary great alliance. In the homes of liberated serfs on the Tibetan Plateau, in coal mines during the festival, in the snow-covered forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, in the mountain villages of Guizhou, and in the remote fishing villages of Hainan Island, the footprints of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams could be seen everywhere during the Spring Festival. Many soldiers and officers, together with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, ate bitter meals, held bitter-sweet remembrance meetings, and greatly enhanced their class feelings and military-civilian unity. An old poor peasant said with tears: "In the old society, during the Spring Festival, landlords and rich people came to collect debts, and poor families were destroyed; in the new society, Chairman Mao sent his children to bring Mao Zedong Thought to our hearts. We must grasp the revolution and promote production, follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution!"

	Soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "three supports, two military" work across the country, during the Spring Festival, went deep into the masses to solicit opinions, and together with the revolutionary masses, formulated measures to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and improve work. The soldiers and officers are determined to take the Fourth Platoon of Heroes, Comrade Li Wenzhong, and the 834th Unit as examples, to further implement the principle of "supporting the left but not supporting factions," to do a better job in the "three supports, two military" work, and to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在人民解放军强有力的支持下取得无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在春节期间的拥军活动中强调指出，中国人民解放军是举世无双的英雄军队。我们拥军，最根本的一条就是要同解放军同志一起，条条落实、全面落实毛主席的最新指示。我们拥军，就要在任何时候都坚决相信、依靠、拥护解放军；就要学习解放军无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线的赤胆忠心；就要尽一切力量，维护解放军的崇高威望；就要提高革命警惕性，彻底粉碎阶级敌人破坏军民团结的阴谋活动；就要坚决支持解放军，进一步搞好“三支”“两军”工作。
