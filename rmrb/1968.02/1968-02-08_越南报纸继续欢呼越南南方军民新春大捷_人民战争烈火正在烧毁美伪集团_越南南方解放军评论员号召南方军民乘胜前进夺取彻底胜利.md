Vietnamese newspapers continue to celebrate the New Year's great victory of the South Vietnamese people. The flames of people's war are burning down the U.S.-puppet clique. A commentator from the South Vietnamese Liberation Army calls on the South Vietnamese people to advance and seize a complete victory.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th: The "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" of Vietnam published editorials on the 5th and 6th, continuing to celebrate the New Year's great victory of the South Vietnamese people and calling on the entire nation to bravely fight and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

	The editorial of the "People's Daily" on the 5th said: The entire South Vietnam is boiling with the momentum of attack. The people of the South are rising up in a great wave to fight. Revolutionary troops and compatriots of all classes are bravely charging forward everywhere with an overwhelming momentum to defeat the enemy.

	The editorial said: The powerful attacks of the revolutionary troops and the flames of the people rising up are smashing and burning down the nests of the U.S.-puppet clique one after another. Their rotten neo-colonialist system is rapidly collapsing. The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys are in an extremely difficult situation.

	The editorial said: The U.S. aggressors and their lackeys have suffered heavy blows. But before their death, they will make desperate struggles. Their desperate and evil actions cannot save them from their doomed fate. The South Vietnamese people are determined to fight even harder, launch continuous attacks, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

	The editorial of the "People's Army Daily" on the 6th said: The heavy defeat of the U.S.-puppet clique in the New Year proves that despite having more than a million troops and a large number of modern war tools, they are still defeated by the people's war in the South.

	The editorial pointed out that the victory of the South Vietnamese people in the early spring is extremely great. It shows that the South Vietnamese people have enough strength to smash the aggressive ambitions of the American bandits, defeat the puppet army, overthrow the puppet government, and seize the final victory.

	The editorial emphasized: The American bandits and their lackeys are struggling desperately. They have committed serious crimes against our compatriots in the South. But the more brutal they are, the more they arouse the anger of the Vietnamese people, and the more they suffer heavier blows.

	The editorial finally called on the people of the North to do their utmost to serve the front line, stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the South, advance with the momentum of victory, overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and push the anti-American, national salvation cause to a complete victory.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th: A commentator from the South Vietnamese Liberation Army recently published an article, enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people since the New Year, and calling on all the people of South Vietnam to advance with the momentum of victory and seize a complete victory.

	The article said: The armed attacks and mass struggles of the South Vietnamese people in the New Year have had a very significant impact, multiplying the strength of our people, and urging our people to continue to bravely advance and seize more and more brilliant victories.

	The article said: The New Year's great victory of the South Vietnamese people has caused a great response worldwide, making the progressive people of the world extremely excited and more enthusiastically supporting and encouraging our people's struggle.

	The article said: The New Year's great victory of the South Vietnamese people has powerfully proven: The people's liberation armed forces, who are both wise and brave, have grown unprecedentedly strong and can break through any stronghold of the enemy at any time to seize the greatest victory.

	The article called on the South Vietnamese people to resolutely smash all the counterattacks of the U.S. army, puppet army, and mercenary army, and to decisively, fiercely, and extensively launch attacks on the enemy to seize even more brilliant victories.
