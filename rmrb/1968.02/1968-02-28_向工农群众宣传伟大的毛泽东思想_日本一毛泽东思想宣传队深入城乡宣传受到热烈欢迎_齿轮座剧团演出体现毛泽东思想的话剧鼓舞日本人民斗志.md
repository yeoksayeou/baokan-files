A Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in Japan is Warmly Welcomed in Urban and Rural Areas
The Wheel Theater Performs a Play Reflecting Mao Zedong Thought, Inspiring the Fighting Spirit of the Japanese People

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, the East News Agency reported: A propaganda team composed of the General Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), the East Bookstore, and the Japan-China Travel Agency recently conducted a tour in the urban and rural areas of Fukushima Prefecture, receiving a warm welcome from workers and peasants.

This four-member touring propaganda team, carrying Chairman Mao's works and slides from "Visiting China During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," visited fifteen towns and villages in Fukushima Prefecture from January 21 to February 2. Over three hundred workers, peasants, citizens, and housewives attended the small-scale meetings organized by the propaganda team.

The propaganda team went deep into snow-covered mountain villages to propagate the great thoughts of Mao Zedong and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and enthusiastically introduced China's socialist construction. At night, the team stayed in the homes of workers and peasants, exchanging experiences in struggle.

The propaganda team's Chairman Mao's works and Chinese publications were warmly welcomed by workers and peasants. A young worker, holding a copy of Chairman Mao's works, enthusiastically said, "Once the people study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, they can unleash boundless power."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, the East News Agency reported: The Japanese revolutionary theater group Wheel Seat performed the play "Wildfire," which reflects Chairman Mao's great thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," for the first time on the evening of February 21 in Ube City, Yamaguchi Prefecture. Over seven hundred workers, peasants, and young students were greatly inspired.

This revolutionary play, which depicts a peasant uprising, was created by the Wheel Seat Theater Group after studying Chairman Mao's literary line. It shook Ube City. Despite the heavy snowfall, which is rare in fifty years, people braved the cold to watch the performance, driven by their love for Mao Zedong Thought.

Throughout the performance of "Wildfire," the love of the Japanese people for Mao Zedong Thought was evident. On both sides of the stage, there were two banners with Chairman Mao's sayings: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride on its head for long." and "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first and foremost for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for them and used by them." Before each performance, the announcer would hold up the Little Red Book and loudly read relevant passages from "Quotations from Chairman Mao" related to the plot.

At the end of the final performance, to the resounding songs of "The East Is Red" and "The Internationale," a portrait of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of people worldwide, appeared on the stage. At this moment, the audience expressed their boundless love for Chairman Mao with thunderous applause and cheers that lasted for a long time.

    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：由日中友好协会（正统）总部、东方书店和日中旅行社联合组成的一支毛泽东思想宣传队，最近在福岛县的城乡进行巡回宣传，受到了工农群众的热烈欢迎。
    这支由四名队员组成的巡回宣传队，带着毛主席著作和《在无产阶级文化大革命中访问中国》的幻灯片，从一月二十一日到二月二日访问了福岛县的十五个城镇和农村。有三百多名工人、农民、市民和家庭妇女出席了宣传队举办的小型集会。
    宣传队深入到被大雪覆盖的山村，向农民宣传伟大的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命，并且热情地介绍了中国的社会主义建设。晚上，宣传队就住在工农家里，同他们交流斗争经验。
    巡回宣传队所带的毛主席著作和中国刊物受到工人和农民的热烈欢迎。一个青年工人手里拿着毛主席著作热情地说，人民群众一旦活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，他们就能发挥出无穷的力量。
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本革命剧团齿轮座二十一日晚上在山口县宇部市首次演出体现毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”伟大思想的话剧《野火》，七百多名工农群众和青年学生受到了巨大鼓舞。
    这个描写农民起义的革命话剧，是齿轮座剧团学习毛主席的文艺路线后创作成功的，它震动了宇部市。尽管这两天宇部市下着五十年来少有的大雪，但是人们不怕天寒地冻，怀着对毛泽东思想的热爱，赶去观看演出。
    《野火》的整个演出过程，都反映了日本人民无限热爱毛泽东思想。舞台的两侧，悬挂着两条毛主席语录：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”每场演出开始时，报幕员都手捧红色宝书高声朗读与剧情有关的《毛主席语录》。
    演出最后一场时，在《东方红》和《国际歌》的嘹亮歌声中，舞台上出现了全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的画像。这时，观众用经久不息的雷鸣般掌声和欢呼声，表达对毛主席的无限热爱。
