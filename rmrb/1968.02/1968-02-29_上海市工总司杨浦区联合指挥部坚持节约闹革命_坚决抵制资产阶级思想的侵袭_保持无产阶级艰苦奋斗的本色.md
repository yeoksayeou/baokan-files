Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Yangpu District Joint Command insists on frugality to make revolution, resolutely resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and maintain the proletarian spirit of hard work and self-reliance.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, February 28 - According to a report from the *Liberation Daily*: Comrades from the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Yangpu District Joint Command firmly remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "to further economize and make revolution." They resolutely resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, save national expenses for the state, and maintain the proletarian spirit of hard work and frugality.

Last August, after the two major revolutionary mass organizations in Yangpu District achieved revolutionary great unity and formed the new fighting organization - the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Yangpu District Joint Command, some comrades had the idea of pursuing so-called "standardization" and ostentation. These comrades thought that since the Joint Command is the largest organization in the district, it should look the part, and it would be best to find a small villa as an office and buy some decent desks and chairs. They said: "To do a good job in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a matter of eternal significance, we should not calculate economic accounts, but political accounts." How should this account be calculated? The responsible comrades of the district command organized everyone to discuss this. They reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching: "There may be some Communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns, and they are truly heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." They realized that this is the true political account. Pursuing so-called "standardization" and ostentation is not a small matter, but a big matter that relates to where the power will go.

They studied Mao Zedong Thought, and their eyes were opened. They realized that frugality and wastefulness are a struggle between two ideologies, two lines, and two roads. Especially when everyone recalled the situation when they first rose up to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, they became more aware: In the past, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party tried to use economic power to suppress the proletarian revolutionaries economically, and now we must be especially vigilant against the class enemies trying to buy, corrupt, and destroy the proletarian revolutionaries economically. After we take power, we must hold the economic power firmly and continue to maintain the spirit of hard work. When furniture was insufficient, they obtained the approval of the district revolutionary committee and went to the old furniture warehouse of the district revolutionary committee to pick out more than twenty broken desks and chairs, and solved the problem by repairing and mending them themselves. When transmitting upper-level instructions or holding mass meetings, they tried their best to borrow factory auditoriums or open-air squares as venues, carefully calculating and saving expenses. In propaganda work, they also tried their best not to pursue form but to seek practical results, using typewriters and oil printing instead of lead printing, using 9-inch paper instead of 8-inch paper, and resolutely not printing what can be printed or not. The three Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams under their jurisdiction generally adhere to the principle of "local, nearby, part-time" performances.

To achieve frugality and make revolution, one must insist on criticizing and repudiating revisionism. This is the personal experience of the comrades from the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Yangpu District Joint Command. In the process of implementing Chairman Mao's instruction of "to further economize and make revolution," there is always a struggle between public and private interests. For example, there was a debate over the reimbursement of meal subsidies. After discussion, the comrades believed: The state's money must be used for public purposes and cannot be used for private purposes. In personal life, we should not take a single cent from the state. Under the leadership of the leaders, the staff all voluntarily followed this principle: For the state's funds, use as little as possible, and for personal extra expenses, do not ask the state for anything.

Due to maintaining the proletarian spirit of frugality and hard work, it also promoted the revolutionization of the organization. The command implemented streamlining and improving work style. Through the first and second rounds of adjustments, the number of staff was reduced from more than eighty to more than twenty, and the organizational structure was tightened from the original five groups and one office to one office. The comrades from the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Yangpu District Joint Command are determined to let Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "to further economize and make revolution" take root in their minds and forever maintain revolutionary youthfulness.

    上海市工总司杨浦区联合指挥部坚持节约闹革命
    坚决抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭
    保持无产阶级艰苦奋斗的本色
    新华社上海二十八日电　据《解放日报》报道：上海市工总司杨浦区联合指挥部的同志牢记伟大领袖毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的教导，坚决抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭，为国家节约开支，保持着艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的无产阶级本色。
    去年八月份，杨浦区两大派工人革命群众组织实现了革命大联合，组成了新的战斗组织——工总司杨浦区联合指挥部以后，有些同志曾经出现追求所谓“正规化”、讲排场的思想。这些同志认为，联合指挥部是区里最大的一个组织了，应该象样点，顶好找幢小洋房作办公室，买些象样的桌椅。他们说：“搞好文化大革命是万年大计，不能算经济账，应该算政治账。”这笔账究竟应该怎么算法呢？区指挥部的负责人就组织大家展开讨论。他们重温了毛主席的教导：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”认识到，这才是真正的政治账。追求所谓“正规化”、讲排场，这不是一件小事，而是关系到政权将往何处去的大事。
    他们学习了毛泽东思想，眼睛亮了。认识到勤俭节约和铺张浪费是两种思想、两条路线、两条道路的斗争。特别是当大家回忆起刚起来向党内一小撮走资派造反时的情况，更意识到：过去党内一小撮走资派妄想利用财权从经济上压服无产阶级革命派，现在我们则要特别警惕阶级敌人从经济方面来收买、腐蚀、搞垮无产阶级革命派。我们掌权以后，一定要掌好财权，继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风。家具不够用，他们征得区革命委员会的同意，到区革委会旧家具仓库里去挑拣了二十多张破办公桌和凳子，自己动手修修补补解决了问题。在传达上级指示或召开群众性大会时，他们尽量借用工厂的大礼堂或露天广场作会场，精打细算，节约支出。在宣传工作方面，也尽量做到不追求形式，讲求实效，能打字油印的就不用铅印，能用九开纸的就不用八开纸，可印可不印的坚决不印。他们所属的三个毛泽东思想宣传小分队，一般都能坚持“就地，就近，业余”演出的原则。
    要做到节约闹革命，就要坚持斗私批修。这是工总司杨浦区联合指挥部同志的切身体会。在贯彻毛主席“要节约闹革命”指示的过程中，时时刻刻存在着公与私的斗争。比如在报销伙食补贴的问题上，曾有过争论。经过讨论，同志们认为：国家的钞票要用在公上，绝不能用在私上，在个人生活上，我们一分钱也不能要。在头头的带动下，工作人员都自觉地遵守着这样的原则：对国家的资金，能不用就不用，能少用就少用，个人的额外支出，坚决不向国家伸手。
    由于保持无产阶级勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗的本色，也促进了机关的革命化。指挥部实行精兵简政，不断改进工作作风。通过第一批、第二批调整，工作人员从原来的八十多个减少到二十多个，组织机构从原来的五个组一个室紧缩到一个室。工总司杨浦区联合指挥部的同志们决心让毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的光辉思想在自己的脑子里扎根，永葆革命青春。
