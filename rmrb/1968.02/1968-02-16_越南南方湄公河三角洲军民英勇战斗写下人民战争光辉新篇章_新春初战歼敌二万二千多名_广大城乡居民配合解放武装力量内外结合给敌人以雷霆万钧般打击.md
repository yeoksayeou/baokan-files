In the powerful Tet Offensive, the military and people of the Mekong Delta provinces in South Vietnam have fought bravely and in close coordination, launching fierce attacks on various battlefields and enemy strongholds and bases. They have achieved brilliant new victories. Preliminary statistics show that in the first few days, the military and people of various provinces have annihilated more than 22,000 enemy troops and completely annihilated or severely damaged 18 enemy battalions.

According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command in the Central South recently issued a battle report stating that from January 30 to February 4, the military and people of the Central South launched attacks on the enemy's six provincial capitals, including Mỹ Tho and Bến Tre, and other 20 towns. They destroyed many military and political headquarters of the American puppet regime in these towns, causing them to collapse. This included the command centers of six enemy military districts and many residences of puppet "governors." In addition, they seized the enemy's radio stations, opened three prisons, liberated thousands of patriotic compatriots imprisoned by the enemy, and destroyed tens of enemy ammunition depots.

The report said that preliminary statistics show that from January 30 to February 4, the military and people of the Central South annihilated more than 16,000 enemy troops, including nearly 1,000 American invaders. They annihilated and severely damaged seven enemy infantry battalions, including one American battalion; annihilated and severely damaged three enemy armored battalions and ten infantry companies; sank and destroyed 14 military vessels, destroyed 115 military vehicles, and shot down 13 enemy aircraft.

The report said that while the Liberation Armed Forces and the uprising forces launched fierce attacks on the enemy, hundreds of thousands of people also rose up to support the attacks and seize enemy headquarters and outposts. In various cities, they mercilessly annihilated thugs and pursued the remnants of the enemy. They cut off more than 20 important transportation lines in the provinces and districts of the Central South, and in coordination with the Liberation Armed Forces, they captured, destroyed, or forced the enemy to withdraw or surrender more than 200 outposts and sentry posts, liberating tens of thousands of urban and rural people.

The report said that facing the fierce offensive of the revolutionary armed forces and the earth-shattering uprising of the people, the puppet military and officials from the provincial to the village levels were in a state of panic and large-scale collapse. Among them, the puppet military's main force, the 7th Division, in addition to nearly 1,000 being annihilated, thousands of soldiers also defected or fled.

The report said that during the attacks on the enemy, people of all classes in the entire region actively supported the front lines with manpower and resources. Tens of thousands of people joined the assault teams or service teams. In just a few days, 3,000 young people enlisted and rushed to the front lines to fight the enemy.

The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Command in the Western South recently issued a battle report stating that from January 31 to February 7, the military and people of the Western South simultaneously launched fierce attacks on the enemy strongholds in the cities of Cần Thơ, Sóc Trăng, Trà Vinh, Vĩnh Long, Bạc Liêu, Rạch Giá, and Đất Đỏ. They severely damaged and controlled almost all the military and political headquarters of the American puppet regime, seized many of the enemy's facilities, causing the enemy's ruling machinery to collapse, and annihilated a large number of the enemy's fighting forces. Preliminary statistics show that during this period, the military and people of the Western South killed and captured more than 6,200 American puppet troops, and caused more than 25,000 puppet soldiers and government officials to collapse. They annihilated and severely damaged eight puppet main force battalions.

The report said that the military and people of the Western South also attacked seven enemy military airfields, including Lộc Ninh, Vĩnh Long, and Trà Vinh, destroying and shooting down more than 100 enemy aircraft, causing most of the airfields to collapse. In addition, they burned and damaged hundreds of enemy armored vehicles and other military vehicles, sank tens of military vessels, seized two American naval bases in Vĩnh Long and Trà Vinh, seized and burned many enemy warehouses, and liberated more than 2,000 patriotic compatriots imprisoned by the enemy.

The report said that in this powerful offensive, the people of various cities in the Western South rose up to annihilate thugs, overthrow the enemy's rule, establish revolutionary governments, organize guerrilla forces and self-defense forces, and coordinate with the Liberation Armed Forces to repel the enemy's counterattacks. The people in the rural areas occupied by the enemy also rose up to coordinate with the Liberation Armed Forces to attack and seize 33 military sub-districts and county towns, capture and force the enemy to surrender or withdraw from more than 200 outposts and sentry posts, liberate large rural areas, cut off many important transportation lines, and isolate many enemy military districts, outposts, and sentry posts. Hundreds of American "advisors" fled in panic.

The report said: Under the thunderous blows of the entire region's military and people, the puppet military and government officials were in a state of panic and large-scale collapse. Many puppet governors and county chiefs fled. The soldiers of the puppet 2nd Armored Battalion and 3rd Armored Battalion stationed in Cần Thơ and other large numbers of puppet soldiers in other regions successively defected. Tens of thousands of puppet soldiers fled or surrendered to the people.
