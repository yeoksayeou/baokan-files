In recent days, the entire province of Hebei has been adorned with red flags and filled with songs of joy. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people, with hearts full of joy, are enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Their voices of song and cheers have merged into the strongest melody of the times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing the great leader Chairman Mao a long life! A long, long life!" In this moment of celebrating victory, the revolutionary masses recall with happiness the warm care that the great leader Chairman Mao has shown for the revolutionary people of Hebei. They say, at every critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hebei, our great leader Chairman Mao has given wise instructions. Every victory achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hebei is a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establish more Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more extensively and deeply. We must implement and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continue to advance, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights the people have won must not be allowed to be easily lost; they must be defended with struggle." In this moment of celebrating victory, the revolutionary people of the entire province remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, determined to maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, actively safeguard the revolutionary authority of the provincial revolutionary committee, making it more solid and more vigorous. All members of the provincial revolutionary committee have eaten bitter meals together and worked in factories and rural areas, indicating that they will never forget the bitterness of class struggle, always maintain close ties with the masses, serve the people wholeheartedly, and establish a highly revolutionary and combative style, making the revolutionary committee a strong command center for leading the people of the entire province to firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought.

In the grand celebration of the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, the revolutionary masses in various parts of the province have launched a new high tide of supporting the military. They have expressed their determination to forever stand shoulder to shoulder with the People's Liberation Army, forming an iron wall, actively assisting the People's Liberation Army in better completing the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries," and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

The revolutionary masses in various places firmly remember the great instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production." With practical actions of seizing the revolution and vigorously promoting production, they celebrate the glorious birth of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the Hebei People's Publishing House regard printing more and better copies of Chairman Mao's works as a gift to the provincial revolutionary committee. In addition to completing their planned tasks, they have printed an additional two million copies of single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary workers of the Jingxing Coal Mine, who completed the 1967 coal production plan a month ahead of schedule, have, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres stationed in the mine, redoubled their efforts and completed the January production plan two days ahead of schedule and in excess of the plan. They are determined to produce more coal to welcome the new victories of the Cultural Revolution. The industrial front in Shijiazhuang City is also full of vigor, with good news coming in frequently. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, who are preparing for an even greater harvest this year, are filled with joy and are actively engaged in spring plowing preparations.

The People's Liberation Army in Hebei Province and the broad cadres and soldiers of the Hebei garrison enthusiastically acclaim the victorious birth of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who have established immortal merits in the "three supports and two militaries" work, unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, implement and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and, together with the broad revolutionary masses, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the past few days, the barracks of various units have been filled with joy. The cadres and soldiers, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," have danced and sung their way through the streets, celebrating the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The cadres and soldiers of the garrisons in Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and the Hebei Military Region have organized large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to spread the good news to the foothills of the Taihang Mountains, the base of the Yanshan Mountains, and the shores of the Bohai Sea. The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit in Shijiazhuang have also rehearsed and performed artistic programs, forming a joyous team to report the good news to the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses near the barracks. Wherever they went, the place was filled with cheers, and the military and the people together shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The broad cadres and soldiers fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" have, in recent days, held celebratory meetings with the revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses. The cadres and soldiers, together with the broad revolutionary masses, have enthusiastically discussed the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and the current excellent situation. They said with great emotion that all our victories are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. We must strive even harder to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, implement and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The leftist cadres in Zhangjiakou and other places have also invited revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to discuss the experiences of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and, based on the new situation, have formulated plans and measures for further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They emphasized that sailing the great seas requires a helmsman, and revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and honestly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, we will achieve victory.

In these days of celebrating victory, the broad cadres and soldiers have repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "not relying on past merits but establishing new ones." They have unanimously expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, learn humbly from the local areas while helping the revolutionary cadres to hold and use power well, and establish new merits for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
