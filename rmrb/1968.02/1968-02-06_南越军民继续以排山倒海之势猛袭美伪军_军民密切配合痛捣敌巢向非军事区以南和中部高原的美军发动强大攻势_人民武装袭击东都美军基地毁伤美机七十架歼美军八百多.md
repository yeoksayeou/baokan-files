The heroic armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the broad masses of the people have been launching powerful attacks against the US and puppet forces for the seventh consecutive day with overwhelming force. At present, the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam are continuing to strike at enemy strongholds such as Saigon and Hue, while simultaneously launching powerful offensives against the US aggressors in the areas south of the demilitarized zone and in the central highlands. They have annihilated a large number of enemy troops and are advancing victoriously, determined to achieve greater victories.

On the morning of the 5th, the National Liberation Front's armed forces launched a fierce artillery and ground assault on the US base at Khe Sanh, south of the demilitarized zone. By the morning of the same day, they had broken through the outer defensive perimeter of Hill 861, which overlooks the Khe Sanh airfield. In close combat, the National Liberation Front's armed forces killed and wounded many American aggressors. The US base at Khe Sanh, which has been surrounded by the liberation forces, is an important strategic stronghold for the US aggressors south of the demilitarized zone. It is garrisoned by 6,000 US Marines and many other American aggressors. The liberation forces have already cut off all enemy supply routes to this base, isolating them. After the powerful offensive launched by the National Liberation Front's armed forces on the 5th, the US aggressors were thrown into a state of panic and chaos.

On the 4th, the National Liberation Front's armed forces also attacked the US camp at Pleiku, a strategic stronghold in the central highlands. Heavy rocket and mortar fire killed and wounded many American aggressors.

A few days ago, the National Liberation Front's armed forces ambushed a US convoy on the road near Pleiku, blew up bridges, and annihilated a large number of US aggressors.

The National Liberation Front's armed forces, in close cooperation with the local people, continue to strike at the enemy in many cities and expand their political influence, strengthening and expanding the anti-US united front. Guerrilla units of the National Liberation Front's armed forces are very active in the Saigon area, attacking US and puppet forces near the "presidential palace" in the afternoon of the 5th, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In the suburbs of Saigon, fierce battles are still raging. The National Liberation Front's armed forces are relentlessly pursuing the enemy. Western news agencies admit that the National Liberation Front's armed forces are "very active" in the densely populated area of Cho Lon, adjacent to Saigon. There, the local people and the National Liberation Front's armed forces are fighting side by side, and many are holding up the flags and banners of the National Liberation Front, marching in demonstrations. The US aggressors, though reinforced, are still in a state of panic, fearing that the National Liberation Front's armed forces will launch "more large-scale attacks" in the center of Saigon.

The National Liberation Front's armed forces still control the important city of Hue in northern South Vietnam. On the 5th, they blew up the bridge on the road from Hue to the headquarters of the US Marine Corps' 3rd Division in Phu Bai, cutting off the supply lines of the US aggressors attempting to counterattack Hue. The National Liberation Front's armed forces, with high morale, fiercely attacked the enemy forces counterattacking in some areas of Hue, killing and wounding a large number of enemies. On the 4th, the National Liberation Front's armed forces also attacked the puppet military stronghold of Phu Loc, four kilometers south of Hue, killing and wounding more than 200 puppet soldiers and capturing more than 300.

In a series of important cities and bases such as Da Nang, Ban Me Thuot, Kontum, and Vinh Long, the National Liberation Front's armed forces continued to annihilate the enemy and expand their victories on the 5th. In recent days, under the call of the National Liberation Front, batches of puppet soldiers have been defecting or surrendering with their weapons.

According to a supplementary report, in the battles against the US base at Long Binh near Saigon on January 30 and February 1, the National Liberation Front's armed forces achieved brilliant results, destroying and damaging 70 US aircraft and killing and wounding more than 800 US soldiers. The National Liberation Front's armed forces also attacked and controlled the town of Go Cong. The people of this county, numbering in the thousands, rose up to capture the most notorious traitors and set up roadblocks in the city and on the roads to intercept enemy reinforcements.

    南越军民继续以排山倒海之势猛袭美伪军
    军民密切配合痛捣敌巢向非军事区以南和中部高原的美军发动强大攻势
    人民武装袭击东都美军基地毁伤美机七十架歼美军八百多
    新华社河内五日电　英雄的越南南方人民解放武装力量和广大人民一道，以排山倒海之势向美伪军发动的强大袭击，已胜利进入第七天。现在越南南方军民一面继续痛捣西贡、顺化等敌人巢穴，一面又在非军事区以南和中部高原战场向美国侵略军发动强大攻势，消灭了敌人的大批有生力量，并且正在乘胜前进，决心夺取更大的胜利。
    人民解放武装力量五日黎明前向非军事区以南美军溪星基地发动了猛烈的炮击和地面攻击，当天早晨已突破了俯瞰溪星机场的八六一高地的美军外围防御圈。在近战中，人民解放武装力量杀伤了许多美国强盗。已经陷入解放军的重重包围之中的美军溪星基地，是美国侵略军在非军事区以南战场的重要战略据点，在那里有六千名美国海军陆战队官兵和许多其他美国强盗。解放军早已切断了敌人通向这个基地的各个要道，使敌人陷于孤立。在人民解放武装力量五日的强大攻势开始后，美国侵略者吓得一片惊慌混乱。
    四日，人民解放武装力量还向中部高原的战略要地德都的美军营地发动了攻击，猛烈的火箭和迫击炮火杀伤了许多美国强盗。
    几天以前，人民解放武装力量曾在德都附近的公路上伏击美军车队，炸断了桥梁，消灭了大批美国侵略军。
    人民解放武装力量同当地人民密切结合，继续在许多城市痛打敌人，并不断扩大政治影响，扩大和加强反美统一战线的力量。人民解放武装力量的游击小组在西贡市区非常活跃，五日下午袭击了伪“总统府”附近的美伪军，使敌人遭到很大伤亡。在西贡郊区，激烈的战斗正在继续进行着。人民解放武装力量揪住敌人狠打。西方通讯社承认，人民解放武装力量在紧邻西贡的居民稠密区堤岸“非常活跃”。在那里，当地人民和人民解放武装力量并肩战斗，许多人还高举民族解放阵线的旗帜和标语，举行了示威游行。困守西贡的美国侵略者虽然有了援兵，仍旧惶恐万状，惊呼人民解放武装力量在西贡中心将发动“更多的大规模的进攻”。
    人民解放武装力量五日仍然控制着南越北部重镇顺化市，并且在五日炸断了由顺化通往美国海军陆战队第三师总部所在地芙拜的公路桥，切断了向顺化进行反扑的美国侵略军的供应线。斗志昂扬的人民解放武装力量猛烈打击在顺化市的一些地方进行反扑的敌军，杀伤了大批敌人。人民解放武装力量四日还袭击了顺化以南四公里的伪军福戈据点，打死打伤伪军二百多人，俘虏三百多人。
    在岘港、邦美蜀、昆嵩和永隆等一系列重要城市和基地里面或附近，人民解放武装力量五日继续痛歼敌人，扩大战果。这几天，在越南南方民族解放阵线的号召下，一批一批的伪军官兵不断起义或携带武器向人民投诚。
    另据补充报道，在西贡附近的嘉定省，人民解放武装力量在一月三十和二月一日两次袭击东都美军基地的战斗中取得辉煌战果，共击毁击伤美机七十架，打死打伤美军八百多人。人民解放武装力量还袭击和控制了古芝县城。这个县的成千人民起来搜捕罪大恶极的越奸，并且在城内和公路上筑起路障，截击敌人的增援部队。
