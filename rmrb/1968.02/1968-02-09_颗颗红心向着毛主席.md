Every Red Heart Turned Towards Chairman Mao

Let the descendants forever love Chairman Mao

A Laotian friend has an infinite love for Chairman Mao. He always hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao in his home. One day, his house was destroyed by bombs from American air pirates. He braved the danger and rushed into the house amidst the blazing fire, not caring to take anything else, but first took out this portrait of Chairman Mao. He barely escaped from the fire, and seeing that the edges of the portrait of Chairman Mao had been burned, his heart was filled with sorrow, and he felt an immense hatred towards the enemy. Later, he asked a Chinese friend for another portrait of Chairman Mao, and treasured the one he had rescued from the fire. He told the Chinese friend: "I must keep the portrait of Chairman Mao that I rescued from the fire to pass on to my descendants, so that they will forever love Chairman Mao!"

Long live Mao Zedong!

Japanese farmers who are bravely fighting against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries deeply admire the great leader Chairman Mao and yearn for the socialist China led by Chairman Mao. Not long ago, a few Chinese friends visited the countryside of Niiigata Prefecture. At the arrangement of Japanese friends, a farmers' symposium was held. Japanese farmers, who have experienced much bitterness, poured out their sufferings to the Chinese friends and discussed their struggle experiences. They also inquired with great concern and envy about how the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, had overthrown the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people; how Chinese farmers, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, had successfully embarked on the road of cooperation and realized the communalization of the people; and about the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao. After hearing the introduction from the Chinese friends, they unanimously pointed out that it is precisely because of the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao that there is the new China of today, and the thriving scene in the Chinese countryside. They said: "China's today is Japan's tomorrow." When the Chinese friends presented the shining Mao badges to the Japanese farmers participating in the symposium, they pinned them on their chests with boundless reverence. Someone, while stroking the Mao badge, excitedly said to the surrounding farmers: "Look, Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!" and could not help but shout: "Long live Mao Zedong!"

Forever Advance Along the Path Indicated by Chairman Mao

In some towns in Burma, one often sees the following scene: some revolutionary people, disregarding the various threats from the Ne Win reactionary government, proudly wear Mao badges on their chests. A group of Burmese workers wrote to Chinese friends saying: "We have all worn the shining Mao badges on our chests. This is our greatest pride and greatest honor! We guarantee to forever advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao!"

A Burmese youth, visiting a friend from afar, obtained a Mao badge from his friend. He excitedly said: "Those who wear the Mao badge on their chests should all think carefully: whether their words and deeds conform to the teachings of Chairman Mao, and whether they are worthy to be good students of Chairman Mao."

Eagerly Hope to Obtain Mao Badges

A Pakistani university student wrote a letter requesting a Mao badge. This student wrote in the letter: My good friend Rashid wears a shining Mao badge. I told him that I love Chairman Mao and requested Rashid to lend me the badge to wear for a few days, but he refused. He said that he also loves Chairman Mao, and that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the people of the whole world.

This university student who loves Chairman Mao then requested Chinese friends to help fulfill his wish and send him a Mao badge.

Our Hearts Are with Mao Zedong

In Algiers, an elderly fisherman with gray hair took the hands of Chinese comrades, invited them onto his fishing boat for a tour, and then invited them to his home as guests. The Chinese comrades pinned a Mao badge on the elderly fisherman's chest. He excitedly pointed with trembling hands towards the red sun in the east and said: "Our hearts are with Mao Zedong!"

Support Mao Zedong, Hearts Turned Towards New China

An Italian female student studying in Britain, seeing Chinese students abroad wearing Mao badges on their chests, enthusiastically requested an introduction to the situation in China under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Chinese students introduced to her the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. After hearing this, she was extremely excited and said: "Our ideals have been realized in China. We support Mao Zedong, our hearts are with New China."

Mao Zedong Belongs to the People of the Whole World

One day, an elderly French woman specially visited Chinese friends to express her infinite love and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. During the conversation, the Chinese friends said: "Our great leader Chairman Mao..." Before the words were finished, the woman quickly added: "Chairman Mao is not only yours but also ours!" As she spoke, she could not help but shout: "Chairman Mao belongs to the people of the whole world!"

    颗颗红心向着毛主席
    让子孙后代永远热爱毛主席
    一位老挝朋友无限热爱毛主席，他家中一直挂着一张毛主席像。有一天，他的房子被美国空中强盗的炸弹炸坏了。他不怕危险冒着炽烈的大火，奋勇冲进屋里，什么都顾不得拿，首先取出了这张毛主席像。他好不容易从火中钻了出来，一看手中毛主席像的四边被烧坏了一些，心里非常难过，同时激起对敌人的无比仇恨。后来，他又向中国朋友要了一张毛主席像，而把那张从大火中抢救出来的毛主席像珍藏了起来。他对中国朋友说：“我一定要把那张在大火中抢救出来的毛主席像留给子孙后代，叫他们永远热爱毛主席！”
    毛泽东万岁！
    同美日反动派进行英勇斗争的日本农民，衷心爱戴伟大的领袖毛主席，向往着毛主席领导的社会主义中国。不久前的一天，几个中国朋友访问了新澙县的农村，在日本朋友的安排下，举行了一次农民座谈会。饱尝辛酸的日本农民向中国朋友倾诉了他们的痛苦，畅谈了他们的斗争事迹。他们还极为关切和十分羡慕地询问了中国人民在毛主席领导下怎样搬掉了压在中国人民头上的三座大山；中国农民又怎样在毛主席领导下胜利地走上了合作化道路，实现了人民公社化；以及中国人民在毛主席领导下进行的无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的情况。他们听完中国朋友介绍的情况后一致指出，正是因为有了伟大的毛主席的英明领导，才有了今天的新中国，才有了今天中国农村蒸蒸日上的繁荣景象。他们说：“中国的今天，就是日本的明天。”当中国朋友把金光闪闪的毛主席像章赠送给参加座谈会的日本农民时，他们以无限崇敬的心情把毛主席像章别在胸前。有人一面抚摸着毛主席像章，一面激动地向周围的农民说：“你们看，毛泽东，毛泽东！”并且情不自禁地欢呼：“毛泽东万岁！”
  永远沿着毛主席指引的方向前进
    在缅甸的一些城镇的大街上，常常出现这样的情景：一些革命人民不顾奈温反动政府的种种威胁，傲然地在胸前佩戴着毛主席像章。一批缅甸工人写信给中国朋友说：“我们每个人胸前都戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章了。这是我们最大的骄傲和最大的光荣！我们保证永远沿着毛主席指引的方向前进！”
    一位缅甸青年远程拜访他的朋友，从朋友那里得到了一枚毛主席像章。他激动地说：“凡是在胸前戴着毛主席像章的人，都应该好好地想一想：自己的言行是不是符合毛主席的教导，自己配不配做毛主席的好学生。”
    热切希望得到毛主席像章
    一位巴基斯坦大学生来信要求得到毛主席像章。这位大学生在信中说：我的好朋友拉希德佩戴着一枚闪闪发光的毛主席像章。我对他说，我热爱毛主席，要求拉希德把像章借给我佩戴几天，他不肯。他说，他也热爱毛主席，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界人民的伟大领袖。
    这位热爱毛主席的大学生便要求中国朋友帮助满足他的愿望，送给他一枚毛主席像章。
    我们的心向着毛泽东
    在阿尔及利亚的阿尔泽，一位头发斑白的老渔民，拉着中国同志的手，把他们接到渔船上参观，并且要他们到他家里去作客。中国同志把毛主席像章佩戴在老渔民胸前。他激动地用颤抖的手，指着东方的红太阳说：“我们的心向着毛泽东！”
    拥护毛泽东，心向新中国
    一位在英国念书的意大利女学生，看到胸前佩戴着毛主席像章的中国留学生，就热情地要求向她介绍毛主席领导下的中国情况。中国同学给她介绍了关于中国开展无产阶级文化大革命的情况，她听了以后，异常激动地说：“我们的理想在中国实现了。我们拥护毛泽东，心向新中国。”
    毛主席是全世界人民的
    有一天，一位年老的法国妇女特地去拜访中国朋友，倾吐她对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱和无限敬仰的心情。在交谈中，中国朋友说：“我们的伟大领袖毛主席……”话音未落，这位妇女连忙接着说：“毛主席不仅是你们的，也是我们的！”说着，说着，她便情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席是全世界人民的！”
