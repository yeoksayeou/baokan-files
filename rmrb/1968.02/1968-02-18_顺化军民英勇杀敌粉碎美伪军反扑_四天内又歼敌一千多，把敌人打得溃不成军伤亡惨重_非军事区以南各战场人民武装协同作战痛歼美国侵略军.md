After 17 days of fierce battle, the glorious flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, flying over the ancient city of Hue, shines even more brilliantly. The heroic military and civilian population of Hue are skilled in both attack and defense, fighting more bravely with each passing day. In recent days, they have struck down the crazed counterattack of the U.S. puppet army, annihilating a large number of enemy forces.

In recent days, the U.S. aggressors have been relentlessly bombing and shelling the heroic city of Hue, repeatedly sending reinforcements to counterattack, in a futile attempt to reverse their heavy losses. However, the brave and tenacious military and civilian population of Hue not only withstood the bombardment of U.S. bombs and shells, repelling the enemy's repeated counterattacks, but also launched fierce assaults on the enemy, wiping out a large number of U.S. puppet troops. According to incomplete statistics, from February 11th to 14th, over the course of four days, the military and civilian population of Hue annihilated more than a thousand enemy troops.

On the 11th and 12th, the military and civilian population of Hue consecutively thwarted the enemy's multiple counterattacks, eliminating 400 enemy troops, including 300 U.S. aggressors, and capturing or forcing the surrender of nearly 400 enemy troops. During these two days, the military and civilian population of Hue also destroyed or damaged nine enemy tanks and sank three U.S. military vessels carrying troops.

On the 13th, the military and civilian population of Hue launched three fierce assaults on three companies of the U.S. Marine Corps, killing or wounding nearly a hundred U.S. aggressors and damaging several U.S. aircraft.

On the 14th, the military and civilian population of Hue fought extremely bravely throughout the day. In the Dai Noi district and the right bank of the Perfume River, they consecutively repelled ten enemy counterattacks, eliminating 400 enemy troops, including 200 U.S. aggressors.

Under the fierce assaults of the military and civilian population of Hue, the U.S. puppet army suffered heavy casualties. The streets of Hue were littered with the corpses of enemy soldiers. Entire enemy battalions were routed. An American "advisor" in the puppet army's 7th Airborne Battalion admitted that in just three days, more than 200 of their troops were killed or wounded by the military and civilian population of Hue. This battalion of about 500 men had lost more than three-quarters of its strength and had completely lost its combat effectiveness.

The people's liberation armed forces in other battlefields south of the demilitarized zone coordinated closely with the heroic struggle of the military and civilian population of Hue, striking the U.S. aggressors everywhere, leaving the enemy forces in disarray and unable to support each other. On the 13th and 14th, the people's liberation armed forces launched fierce artillery barrages against the U.S. military base at Khe Sanh. On the 14th, they also launched fierce assaults on the U.S. bases at Phu Bai and Chu Lai, a U.S. Marine Corps regiment south of the demilitarized zone, and another U.S. force near Khe Sanh. On the 16th, the people's liberation armed forces launched a fierce assault on the U.S. Marine Corps south of Da Nang and ambushed a U.S. company south of the demilitarized zone, killing or wounding more than a hundred enemy troops.

    顺化军民英勇杀敌粉碎美伪军反扑
    四天内又歼敌一千多，把敌人打得溃不成军伤亡惨重
    非军事区以南各战场人民武装协同作战痛歼美国侵略军
    据新华社河内十六日电　经过十七天的激烈战斗后，飘扬在顺化古城上空的越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜，显得更加光辉夺目。英雄的顺化军民能攻善守，越战越勇，近几天来，把疯狂进行反扑的美伪军打得一败涂地，又歼灭了敌军大量有生力量。
    连日来，美国侵略者对英雄的顺化城不断进行狂轰滥炸，并一再增援进行反扑，妄图以此来挽救它的惨重失败。但是英勇顽强的顺化军民不仅经受住了美国炸弹和炮弹的轰击，打退了敌人一次又一次的反扑，而且向敌人发动猛烈进攻，消灭了大批美伪军。据不完全统计，从二月十一日到十四日四天中，顺化军民又歼灭了美伪军一千多名。
    十一日和十二日两天，顺化军民接连挫败敌人的多次反扑，消灭敌人四百名，其中包括美国侵略军三百名，俘虏和投降的敌人近四百名。在这两天中，顺化军民还击毁击伤敌人坦克九辆，击沉运载美国侵略军的军用船只三艘。
    十三日，顺化军民三次猛烈袭击美国海军陆战队三个连，打死打伤美国侵略军近百名，击伤美机多架。
    十四日一整天，顺化军民进行了非常英勇的战斗，在大内区周围和香江右岸，先后击溃了十股敌军的反扑，消灭敌人四百名，其中包括美国侵略军二百名。
    在顺化军民的猛烈打击下，美伪军伤亡惨重，顺化街道上横七竖八地躺满了敌军的尸体。整营的敌军被打得溃不成军。伪军第七伞兵营的美国“顾问”承认，这个营三天中就被顺化军民打死打伤二百多名，这个约五百人的营已伤亡了四分之三以上，完全丧失了战斗力。
    非军事区以南地区其他战场的人民解放武装力量，同顺化军民的英勇战斗紧密配合，到处痛击美国侵略者，打得各地的敌军自顾不暇，无法相顾。十三日和十四日，人民解放武装力量又接连以猛烈的炮火轰击溪山美军基地。十四日这一天，人民解放武装力量还猛烈袭击了美军的芙拜和朱莱基地、非军事区以南的美国海军陆战队一个团以及溪山附近的另一支美军。十六日，人民解放武装力量猛烈进攻岘港以南的美国海军陆战队，并且在非军事区以南伏击了一连美军，打死打伤敌军一百多名。
