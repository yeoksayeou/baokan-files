Is It Really "Improving Workers' Lives"?
Beijing Municipal Light Industry Products Import and Export Company, Jin Shuliang

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promotes the "material incentive" black goods. Under the guise of "improving workers' lives," he pushes the bonus system. He talks about "money" every time he opens his mouth, and "money" every time he closes it. The Chinese Khrushchev is such a representative of the bourgeoisie, reeking of the stench of money.

In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, our working class's enthusiasm for building socialism is driven by "money." Pfft! This is a great insult to our working class. We, the working class, are inspired by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, serving the revolution of all China and the world, striving for the realization of communism worldwide. Our enthusiasm for building socialism is driven by political leadership. Who cares about your stinking money!

The Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "improving workers' lives" is nothing but empty talk. In reality, it's just a change of label, but the essence remains the same—it's a bourgeois scheme. In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, "improving workers' lives" is just a cover. The real intention is to promote counter-revolutionary economism. The Chinese Khrushchev tries to use a few stinking coins as bait to corrupt and poison the workers, making them forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat and Mao Zedong Thought, and unknowingly and comfortably turning into revisionists, comfortably undergoing "peaceful evolution."

In short, the Chinese Khrushchev wants to use "money," small favors, immediate benefits, and the stinking sign of "improving workers' lives" to deceive the workers. What he truly wants to bring to the workers is double suffering. In one word, what the Chinese Khrushchev wants to "improve" is not the "workers' lives" at all. Instead, he aims to turn our great socialist system into capitalism through counter-revolutionary economism and turn our proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. This is something we will never accept!

### 果真是“改善职工生活”吗？

    果真是“改善职工生活”吗？

    中国赫鲁晓夫极力推行“物质刺激”黑货，他打着“改善职工生活”的幌子，大搞奖金挂帅。他张口一个“钱”，闭口一个“钱”。中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样一个浑身散发着铜臭的资产阶级代表人物。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，我们工人阶级建设社会主义的积极性，是靠“钱”来调动的。呸！这是对我们工人阶级的莫大污辱。我们工人阶级靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，为全中国、全世界革命服务，为在全世界实现共产主义而努力奋斗。我们工人阶级的建设社会主义的积极性，是靠政治挂帅来调动的。谁希罕你那几个臭钱！
    中国赫鲁晓夫的什么“改善职工生活”，完全是花言巧语，实际上是换了商标没换货，骨子里完全是资产阶级的一套。在中国赫鲁晓夫那里，“改善职工生活”是幌子，而骨子里是大搞反革命经济主义。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用几个臭钱为钓饵，来腐蚀、毒害工人，使工人群众忘记无产阶级专政，忘记毛泽东思想，在不知不觉中舒舒服服地变成修正主义，舒舒服服地“和平演变”过去。
    说穿了，中国赫鲁晓夫就是妄图用“钱”，用小恩小惠，用眼前的一点福利，用“改善职工生活”的臭招牌来迷惑工人，而真正要给工人带来的是受二遍苦。一句话，中国赫鲁晓夫要“改善”的，根本不是什么“职工生活”，而是想通过反革命经济主义，把我们伟大的社会主义变成资本主义；把我们的无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这是我们永远不能答应的！
