The Tet Offensive by the Vietnamese people in the South has resonated like a spring thunder across the globe. It has greatly boosted the revolutionary struggles of people around the world and has significantly raised the morale of revolutionary people everywhere. People around the world enthusiastically acclaim the brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people in the South as a great contribution to the anti-imperialist struggle of the world's people, setting a shining example for the liberation struggles of all the world's people.

The People's Voice of Albania praises the Vietnamese people as heroic and unyielding.

The People's Voice of Albania published an editorial on the 2nd, enthusiastically hailing the recent brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people in the South against the U.S. puppet forces.

The article said that three days ago, the liberation forces of the Vietnamese people in the South launched an unprecedented powerful offensive, surging forward like a torrent, unstoppable. This proves that the initiative on the battlefield in South Vietnam has long been in the hands of the Vietnamese people in the South. These attacks also demonstrate the powerful striking force, perfect organization, and flexible tactics of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army. The liberation war of the Vietnamese people in the South is developing victoriously, broadly, and deeply. It has reached a higher level.

The article pointed out that in these days, the Vietnamese people in the South, with their steadfast and unshakable patriotic and revolutionary heroic spirit, are writing a glorious epic. This epic will be recorded in history, just like the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. This epic will occupy its rightful place in the history of the liberation wars of the peoples of various countries. People will write in golden letters: The Vietnamese people are heroic and unyielding people; the peoples of various countries are invincible; people's war is indomitable.

The article emphasized that the brilliant victories of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam are outstanding contributions and great inspirations to all revolutionary peoples. They are heavy blows to the number one enemy of all revolutionary peoples, American imperialism.

The article said that American imperialism, in its aggression against Vietnam, has exposed its nature of plunder, as well as its decay. Johnson continues to play the tricks of "escalation" and "peace talks." In this regard, he has received full cooperation from his allies, Khrushchev, Wilson, Indira Gandhi, the Pope, and U Thant.

The article concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people, who are fighting to defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the country, have shown their fearless heroic spirit in the flames of the liberation war and on the battlefield. In this sacred liberation war, the fraternal Vietnamese people have received and will continue to receive the full support and revolutionary solidarity of the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party and government, and all revolutionary peoples of the world.

The Pathet Lao radio station issued a commentary pointing out that the great victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilian people demonstrates the power of people's war.

The Pathet Lao radio station in Laos issued a commentary on the 2nd, enthusiastically hailing the brilliant victories recently achieved by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam in their large-scale attacks on the enemy.

The commentary said that the military and civilian people of South Vietnam simultaneously attacked dozens of enemy towns, many command posts, strongholds, and logistics bases, throwing the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys into chaos and passivity. This demonstrates the immense power and rapid growth of the South Vietnamese military and civilian people who are marching towards complete victory.

The commentary pointed out that the brilliant victories achieved by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam are practical support and great encouragement for the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos who are determined to smash all military adventures of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys in this year's dry season.

Japanese revolutionaries express unbounded joy and say they will take the South Vietnamese people as an example to strengthen their anti-American struggle.

The chairman of the Japan Committee for Asia-Africa Solidarity, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, told a correspondent from the East Is Red News Agency that the New Year's offensive by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam has proved the invincible power of people's war. It has inspired the peoples of Asia and Africa and will promote the armed struggles of the peoples of many countries.

Sakamoto quoted the great leader Chairman Mao's words: "The Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, are waging an anti-American national salvation war. This sets a brilliant example for the struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations for liberation in the world."

Sakamoto said, "The Japanese people will also take Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon and wage a more powerful anti-American patriotic struggle."

The women's activist of the Asia-Africa Solidarity Movement in Hyogo Prefecture, Kasaiya Kiyoko, also quoted Chairman Mao's words in her conversation with a correspondent from the East Is Red News Agency: "Your victory once again shows that, regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." Kasaiya said, "The anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people has completely proved the correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis. The struggle of the Vietnamese people has greatly inspired the peoples of Asia and Africa who are waging people's wars and continuing to fight against American imperialism."

Kasaiya said, "In the future, we will further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, persist in the anti-American patriotic struggle, and drive American imperialism out of Japan."

Recently, in a brave struggle against the docking of the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise," the secretary-general of the Hyogo Prefecture Federation of Trade Unions, Kojima Ko, enthusiastically hailed the great victory recently achieved by the heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam. He said, "We learn from the struggle of the Vietnamese people. To achieve the complete independence of Japan, we must strengthen our struggle."

A patriotic student in Tokyo, Takahashi Yu, said, "The Vietnamese people are truly great! They have beaten the most ferocious army of American imperialism to a pulp." He pointed out that modern revisionism in the Soviet Union cannot save the desperate American imperialism. Takahashi said that the victory of the Vietnamese people proves that no matter the size of the country, revolutionaries can defeat the enemy and achieve victory as long as they rely on the people and wage a people's war.

The Nepal Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee issued a statement saying that the victory of the South Vietnamese people inspires the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The Nepal Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency on the 4th, saying that the victory of the liberation armed forces of the South Vietnamese people has given a great boost to the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for independence and freedom, and has given a serious warning to imperialism and old and new colonialism.

Two Nepalese students told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: The great leader Chairman Mao said, "The days of the American aggressors in Vietnam are numbered." American imperialism will definitely be defeated; Vietnam will definitely win.

African public opinion praises the South Vietnamese people for their contributions to the anti-imperialist cause.

The Tanzanian newspaper "Nationalist" published a commentary on the 2nd, saying that the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam have given the enemy one heavy blow after another, making the enemy more frightened than ever before. The commentary pointed out that the U.S. is in a state of chaos. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is in a superior position, firmly grasping the initiative on the battlefield. The commentary said, "The U.S. will suffer a complete defeat in Vietnam. This is the fate of the arrogant American imperialists."

The organ of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Trade Union Federation, "Congolese Worker," published an article titled "The Americans Are in a Dilemma in Vietnam" in its recent issue, pointing out, "At present, the heroic anti-American national salvation war waged by the Vietnamese people is in a very good situation and will only get better. The victorious struggle of the Vietnamese people has greatly weakened the strength that American imperialism intends to use to dominate the world. This struggle has already caused the counter-revolutionary global strategy of American imperialism to fail." The article concluded by emphasizing that the victories achieved by the Vietnamese people fully prove that people's war is the best way to deal with the aggression of American imperialism. American imperialism will ultimately be reduced to ashes by the flames of people's war.

The executive committee of the National Union of Workers of Mali recently issued a statement saying that the powerful offensive launched by the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam is undoubtedly a failure for the imperialist invaders. For more than seven years, the heroic Vietnamese people have been fighting against the powerful war machine of the imperialists, and because their struggle is just, they have continuously achieved brilliant victories. The statement said, "The workers and people of Mali, who are united with the workers and people of Vietnam, welcome all the victories achieved by the patriotic forces of Vietnam. They regard these victories as a great contribution to the overall struggle of the working class against international imperialism."

Arab peoples say that the U.S. is the common enemy of the peoples of the world.

A friend from Iraq said, "The Iraqi people are overjoyed by the brilliant victories recently achieved by the liberation armed forces and people of South Vietnam in their all-out offensive against the American aggressors and the puppet forces, because American imperialism is our common enemy." The Iraqi newspaper "Revolution" published an editorial on the 4th, saying, "The Arab peoples are well aware that any blow to American imperialism is a blow to Israel. If American imperialism can be defeated in one place, it can also be defeated in other places, including in the Arab world."

A friend from Palestine, in a conversation, quoted a passage from Chairman Mao's telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho last December: "You are fighting well! Under extremely difficult conditions, relying on your own strength, you have beaten the most ferocious American imperialism into a corner, making it desperate and disgraced. This is a great victory." He said that Chairman Mao had correctly evaluated the anti-American national salvation struggle of the South Vietnamese people. He said, "The great victory recently achieved by the South Vietnamese people is a great contribution to the struggle of the peoples of the world against American imperialism. It is a great inspiration to the Palestinian guerrilla fighters and the Palestinian people in the occupied areas who are fighting against American imperialism and its lackey, Israel."

The Syrian newspaper "Revolution" published an editorial on the 2nd, saying, "The indisputable and historic deeds created by the Vietnamese people in these days have confirmed that the people will ultimately win."

The editorial said that some people have doubts about waging a people's war in the occupied Arab lands. The editorial continued, "As the Vietnamese revolutionaries develop people's war into cities and plains, this reactionary lie that has been widely spread has been exposed. This has been confirmed, that is, people's war can be waged under all kinds of natural conditions without exception."

About two thousand people took to the streets of Paris, chanting slogans in support of the Vietnamese people.

About two thousand people in Paris held a demonstration on the evening of the 3rd in the bustling streets of Paris, enthusiastically hailing the brilliant victories recently achieved by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam in their powerful attacks on the American aggressors and their lackeys, and expressing their resolute support for the just cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

The demonstrators carried the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, chanting slogans such as "The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will definitely win!" and "The U.S. is a murderer!" They broke through the heavy obstacles and sabotage of the police authorities and marched towards the bustling streets of Paris. At the end of the demonstration, the demonstrators burned an American flag amidst cheers.

    世界各国人民齐声欢呼越南南方人民打得好
    越南南方人民为世界革命人民树立光辉榜样
    越南南方军民新春大捷象一声春雷响遍全球。它极大地鼓舞了各国人民的革命斗争，大长了各国人民的革命志气。各国人民热烈欢呼越南南方人民的辉煌胜利是对世界人民反帝斗争的巨大贡献，为全世界人民的解放斗争树立了光辉的榜样。
  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》赞扬
    越南人民是英雄的人民不屈的人民
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二日再次发表编辑部文章，极其热烈地欢呼越南南方军民最近对美伪军发动袭击所取得的辉煌胜利。
    文章说，三天以前越南南方人民解放武装力量以空前未有的威力发起的强大攻势的洪流，正在滚滚向前，势不可挡。这证明了越南南方战场的主动权早就掌握在越南南方军民的手中。这些进攻也表明了越南南方解放军有着强大的打击力量，完善的组织性和灵活机动的战术。越南南方人民的解放战争正在胜利地广泛深入地发展。它已经提高到了一个更高的水平。
    文章指出，在这些日子里，越南南方人民以其坚定的和毫不动摇的崇高的爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神，正在写下光荣的史诗，它将象奠边府战役一样永载史册。这一史诗在各国人民解放战争的历史中将占应有的地位，人们将用金色的大字写上：越南人民是英雄的人民，不屈的人民；各国人民是不可征服的；人民战争是坚不可摧的。
    文章强调指出，越南南方军民的辉煌胜利，是对一切革命人民的杰出贡献和巨大鼓舞，是对一切革命人民的头号敌人美帝国主义的沉重打击。
    文章说，美帝国主义在侵越战争中暴露了它的掠夺本性，同时也暴露了它的腐朽性。约翰逊继续在玩弄战争“升级”和鼓吹“和谈”的反革命两手。在这方面，他得到了柯西金、威尔逊、英迪拉·甘地、教皇和吴丹等同盟者的全面合作。
    文章最后说，但是，正在为保卫北方、解放南方和统一祖国而斗争的越南人民，在解放战争的烈火中和战场上，显示了自己的大无畏的英雄气概。在这一神圣的解放战争中，兄弟的越南人民过去和今后将永远得到阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府以及世界一切革命人民的完全支持和革命声援。

    评论指出：越南南方军民所取得的辉煌胜利，是对决心粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗在今年旱季的一切军事冒险的老挝爱国军民的实际支持和巨大鼓舞。
  日本革命人士无比兴奋表示
    以南越人民为榜样加强反美斗争
    亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松向东方通讯社记者发表谈话说，越南南方军民的新春大捷证明了人民战争的无比威力，它鼓舞了亚非各国人民，并将促进许多国家人民的武装斗争。
    坂本德松引用了伟大领袖毛主席的话：“越南人民在伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下进行的抗美救国战争，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。”坂本说：“日本人民也必将以毛泽东思想为武器，更加强有力地开展反美爱国斗争。”
    兵库县的亚非团结运动妇女活动家加濑部贵子在向东方通讯社记者发表的谈话中也引用了毛主席的话：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”加濑说：“越南人民的抗美救国斗争完全证明了毛主席的论断的正确性。越南人民的斗争给坚持人民战争、继续向美帝国主义斗争的亚非各国人民以极大的鼓舞。”
    加濑说：“我们今后要进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己，坚持反美爱国斗争，把美帝国主义从日本赶出去。”
    最近为反对美国核航空母舰“企业号”停泊而进行了英勇斗争的佐世保地区工会会议事务局长小岛亨，热烈欢呼英雄的越南南方军民最近取得的伟大胜利。他说：“我们向越南人民的斗争学习。为了取得日本的完全独立，我们必须加强斗争。”
    东京的爱国学生高桥勇说：“越南人民真是好样的！他们把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义的军队打得落花流水。”他指出，苏联现代修正主义也无法搭救走投无路的美帝国主义。高桥说，越南人民的胜利证明：不论国家大小，革命者只要依靠人民，进行人民战争，就能打败敌人，取得胜利。

    刚果（布）工会联合会机关刊《刚果工人》在最近一期发表一篇题为《美国佬在越南走投无路》的文章指出，“目前，英勇的越南人民所进行的抗美救国战争的形势大好，而且只会越来越好。越南人民的胜利斗争，大大削弱了美帝国主义企图借以称霸世界的力量。这一斗争已经使美帝国主义的反革命的全球战略遭到破产。”文章最后强调指出：“越南人民取得的胜利充分证明，人民战争是对付美帝国主义侵略的最好的方法。美帝国主义最后必将被人民战争的烈火化为灰烬。”
    马里全国工人联合会执行局最近发表声明说：越南南方人民解放武装力量发动的强大攻势，无疑是帝国主义侵略者的一次失败。七年多来同帝国主义者的强大战争机器进行较量的英勇的越南人民，由于他们的斗争是正义的，因而不断取得了辉煌的胜利。声明说：“同越南劳动者和人民团结一致的马里劳动者，欢呼越南爱国力量所取得的一切胜利，他们把这些胜利看作是对工人阶级反对国际帝国主义的总斗争的重大贡献。”

    伊拉克一位朋友说：“伊拉克人民为越南南方人民解放武装力量和人民最近在对美国侵略者和伪军发动的全面出击中所取得的光辉胜利感到欢欣鼓舞，因为美帝国主义是我们的共同敌人。”伊拉克《革命报》四日发表社论说：“阿拉伯人民很明白，对美帝国主义的任何痛击都是对以色列的痛击，如果在一个地方能打败美国，在其他各地包括在阿拉伯也能打败美国。”
    巴勒斯坦一位朋友在谈话中引用了毛主席去年十二月给阮友寿主席的贺电中的一段话：“你们打得好！你们在非常艰苦的条件下，依靠自己的力量，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，这是一个伟大的胜利。”他说，毛主席最正确地评价了越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争。他说：“越南南方人民最近取得的伟大胜利是对世界人民反对美帝斗争的伟大贡献，是对被以色列占领地区的巴勒斯坦游击战士和巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗——以色列斗争的巨大鼓舞。”
    叙利亚《革命报》二日发表社论说：“越南人民这些天来所创造的无可辩驳的具有历史意义的事迹，肯定了人民最后必胜。”
    社论说：有些人对在被占领的阿拉伯土地上进行人民战争有怀疑。社论接着说：“随着越南革命者把人民战争向城市和平原发展的时候，这种反动的大肆散布的谎言被揭穿了。这一点已经肯定了，即在各种自然条件下，毫无例外都能够打人民战争。”
