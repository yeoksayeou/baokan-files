The military and people of Central Vietnam's Thua Thien-Hue region have achieved remarkable feats in the Lunar New Year battles, fighting bravely for ten days and annihilating over ten thousand enemy troops. The close cooperation between the broad revolutionary masses and the liberation armed forces has demonstrated the immense power of people's war.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on February 13, the military and people of Central Vietnam's Thua Thien-Hue region, with an overwhelming momentum and extraordinary courage, have fought tirelessly for ten days, achieving a new level of people's war and securing a tremendous and comprehensive victory.

According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Thua Thien-Hue region's Liberation Armed Forces Command issued a battle report on February 10 stating: Preliminary statistics show that from January 31 to February 9, the military and people of Thua Thien-Hue annihilated, captured, and forced the surrender of over ten thousand enemy troops, including 1,800 American soldiers. Among the annihilated enemy forces were the entire 7th Armored Regiment of the puppet army and six battalions, seventeen companies of American and puppet forces. Among the nearly 2,000 captured enemy troops were one American colonel and dozens of puppet army officers, as well as many provincial and county-level government officials. Many officials, police, and soldiers of the puppet regime surrendered to the people, and many patriotic soldiers of the puppet army turned their guns on the enemy and achieved victories.

The puppet army's 1st Division stationed in Hue was routed, losing its combat effectiveness; this division's 1st and 3rd regiments had three-quarters of their forces annihilated; a puppet paratrooper brigade also lost its combat effectiveness. The enemy's 169 local defense teams and 18 "pacification" units in the Thua Thien-Hue region have been annihilated or completely disbanded. In ten days, the military and people of Thua Thien-Hue also shot down or destroyed 118 enemy aircraft, destroyed over 200 tanks and other military vehicles, destroyed 20 artillery pieces, sank 13 ships, and captured 8 tanks, 10 ammunition and food depots, over 2,000 various weapons, and hundreds of transport vehicles.

The military and people of Thua Thien-Hue captured and forced the enemy to withdraw from 53 targets, seized two prisons, and rescued over 2,200 revolutionary cadres and patriotic people who were imprisoned by the enemy. They also blew up 12 bridges. All major bridges from Hue to Quang Tri and Da Nang have been blown up, completely cutting off the enemy's supply lines.

The report states that after suffering a thunderous blow, the enemy hastily assembled some American and puppet troops for a desperate counterattack, attempting to reoccupy Hue city. Our military and people, with the momentum of victory, bravely confronted the enemy, annihilated many American and puppet units, thwarted the enemy's counterattack, and continued to control Hue city. The military and people of Thua Thien province cooperated with the military and people of Hue, smashing the enemy's entire rural puppet government system, liberating almost all rural areas, and connecting Hue city with the vast rear.

The report states: Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses closely coordinated with the Liberation Armed Forces' offensive, like a tidal wave, annihilating the running dogs and thugs of the puppet regime, establishing revolutionary governments, surrounding enemy strongholds and outposts, calling for the puppet army to revolt, and surrender to the people. Fellow citizens in the city, together with the Liberation Army, quickly established revolutionary committees in many districts after annihilating the enemy. Women in Hue city also participated in the battles. Youth, workers, and students from primary and secondary schools formed many armed self-defense teams, ready to annihilate the enemy at any time, protect the people, and safeguard the revolutionary achievements. Many monks also took up arms to fight the enemy. Many doctors and nurses participated in rescuing the wounded. Workers, trishaw drivers, and others volunteered to transport the wounded.

Meanwhile, in the counties of Thua Thien, Hue, Phu Vang, Phu Loc, Quang Dien, and Phong Dien, tens of thousands of people rose up to destroy the puppet government institutions, surround enemy strongholds, and force the enemy to surrender, completely collapsing the puppet government and enemy forces at the grassroots level. Various places quickly established people's governments and rapidly formed guerrilla units to defend the people's government and protect the homeland. Additionally, thousands of young people enthusiastically joined the Liberation Army, and many became heroes in annihilating the Americans or achieving decisive victories in their first battles. The report points out that under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the military and people of Thua Thien-Hue region have achieved extremely great and comprehensive victories in the past ten days, prominently demonstrating the rapid improvement in the command level and combat capabilities of various Liberation Armed Forces, and showcasing the immense power of people's war.

    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，承天—顺化地区人民解放武装力量指挥部二月十日发表战绩公报说：据初步统计，从一月三十一日到二月九日，承天—顺化军民消灭、活捉和迫降敌人一万多名，其中包括美军一千八百名。在被歼灭的敌军中包括全歼伪军第七装甲团和美伪军六个营，十七个连。在活捉的近二千名敌人中，有美军上校一名和数十名伪军校级和尉级军官，以及许多伪省级、县级政权官员。还有许多伪政权的官员、伪警察和伪军官兵向人民投诚，许多伪军爱国官兵掉转枪口，杀敌立功。
    驻守在顺化地区的伪军第一师被打得人仰马翻，丧失了战斗力，这个师的第一团和第三团有四分之三的兵力被歼灭；伪军一个伞兵旅也丧失战斗力；敌人在承天—顺化地区的一百六十九个民卫队和十八个“绥靖队”已被歼灭或完全瓦解。承天—顺化地区军民十天中还击落击毁各种敌机一百一十八架，击毁坦克和其他军车二百多辆，摧毁大炮二十门，击沉船艇十三艘，缴获敌人坦克八辆、军火库和粮库十座、各种武器两千多件和运输车成百辆。

    公报说，敌人在遭到了雷霆般的打击后，慌忙调集了一些美伪军，进行疯狂的反扑，妄图重新占领顺化市。我们军民以乘胜前进的气势，勇猛地迎击敌人，歼灭了许多美伪军单位，挫败了敌人的反扑，仍然控制顺化市。承天省军民与顺化军民配合，粉碎了敌人的整个乡村伪政权系统，解放了几乎所有的乡村，把顺化市同辽阔的后方连接起来。
    公报说：数以十万计的革命群众与人民解放武装力量的进攻紧密配合，象潮水一样，消灭伪政权走狗和恶棍分子，建立革命政权，包围敌人的据点和哨所，号召伪军起义，向人民投诚。城市里的同胞与解放军一起在许多街区消灭敌人之后，迅速成立了革命委员会。顺化市妇女也参加了战斗，青年、工人、大、中学生成立了许多武装自卫队，准备随时歼灭敌人，保卫人民，保护革命果实。许多僧侣也拿起武器参加杀敌。市内的许多医生、护士参加抢救伤员。劳动人民、三轮车工人等志愿担任运载伤员的工作。
    与此同时，香茶、香水、富汪、富禄、广田、丰田等县的许多乡数以十万计的人民奋起摧毁伪政权机构，包围敌军据点，迫使敌军投降，使伪政权机构和敌人在基层的反动势力完全崩溃。各地纷纷建立人民政权，并迅速地成立了游击队以保卫人民政权，保卫家乡。此外，成千青年踊跃参加解放军，许多人在第一次战斗中就成为歼美勇士或决胜勇士。公报指出，在越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，承天—顺化地区军民在过去十天中取得的极其巨大而全面的胜利，突出地体现了各种人民解放武装力量的指挥水平和作战能力的飞速提高，显示了人民战争的无比威力。（附图片）
