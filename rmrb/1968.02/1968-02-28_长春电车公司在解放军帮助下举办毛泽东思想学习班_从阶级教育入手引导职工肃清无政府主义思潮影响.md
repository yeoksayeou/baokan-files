The revolutionary workers of the Longshan Tram Company, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, held a Mao Zedong Thought study class, focusing on class education to eliminate the influence of anarchist ideology. The workers' revolutionary responsibility has been greatly enhanced, and they voluntarily uphold and maintain revolutionary discipline. The company's revolutionary and production efforts are thriving, setting an example for the entire city in promoting revolution and production.

The Longshan Tram Company is responsible for the city's main transportation. Since the Cultural Revolution, most of the company's workers have firmly carried out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," observing revolutionary discipline, adhering to eight-hour workdays, and participating in revolutionary activities during their spare time. However, some workers, influenced by anarchist ideology, have shown signs of "not wanting to be managed" and "not wanting to manage others." Some workers, especially young workers, emphasize "breaking the mold and revolutionizing on their own," viewing revolutionary discipline as a constraint. During work hours, they come and go as they please, do not follow assignments, and do not adhere to their duties. Some cadres and workers, fearing trouble or being criticized, do not educate or resist such behavior, leading to disruptions in revolutionary and production activities.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, after thorough investigation and analysis, believed that to help workers overcome the influence of anarchist ideology, it is best to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class to fundamentally raise the workers' class consciousness, firmly establish a sense of ownership, and enhance their revolutionary responsibility.

Through remembrance and comparison, strengthening the sense of ownership

Vice Chairman Lin said: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." He also said: "'Two remembrances and three examinations' is the best and deepest political education, a good way to raise the class consciousness of the troops." The Propaganda Team, based on Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, focused on class education in the study class, organizing workers to carry out the "three remembrances and three comparisons" activities: remembering the hardships of being exploited and oppressed by capitalists in the old society and comparing it to the sweetness of being masters after liberation; remembering the Party's cultivation and education and comparing it to one's socialist labor attitude; remembering Chairman Mao's expectations for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and comparing it to one's implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

When recalling the contrast between the old and new societies, the old workers were very moved. They said: In the old society, the tram company was a living hell. The reactionaries and capitalists, to squeeze the blood and sweat of the workers, set hundreds of factory rules, forcing workers to work for dozens of hours a day, even restricting the time and frequency of using the toilet. Slight violations of the factory rules resulted in deductions in wages, beatings, or even dismissal and imprisonment. Workers had no freedom at all. After liberation, workers stood up, became masters, and took control of their own destinies. Now, we work to serve the people and for socialist revolution and construction.

The old workers' experiences before and after liberation are living examples of class education, deeply educating the broad masses of workers, especially the young workers who grew up in the new society. Many workers voluntarily examined their labor attitudes. A young female driver, originally assigned to the main line, felt it was too hard and tiring, so she secretly went to the branch line to drive. Inspired by the old workers' remembrance of bitterness and sweetness, she recalled her miserable childhood of begging on the streets in the old society, tears streaming down her face as she said: "Chairman Mao and the Central Committee call on us, the working class, to be models of grasping revolution and promoting production, models of observing labor discipline. I, however, was poisoned by anarchist ideology, seeking ease, not following assignments, affecting revolution and production, truly disappointing Chairman Mao's expectations for us workers."

The comrades from the Propaganda Team further organized the workers to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Discipline is the guarantee for implementing the line. Without discipline, the Party cannot lead the masses and the army to victory in their struggles." Through study and discussion, everyone realized that discipline serves class interests. Capitalist discipline is to oppress the working people and maintain bourgeois rule; socialist labor discipline is revolutionary discipline, a necessary guarantee for socialist construction, and a protection of the interests of the working class. We, the working class, are the masters of the state and should treat revolutionary discipline with an owner's attitude, love revolutionary discipline with deep class feelings, and consciously observe revolutionary discipline with high revolutionary awareness. Everyone said: "We are building socialism under Chairman Mao's leadership and can only consciously observe revolutionary discipline, contribute to socialist construction, and cannot destroy revolutionary discipline and undermine the foundation of socialism. Anarchism and the destruction of revolutionary discipline will interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and be disloyal to Chairman Mao!"

With the fundamental issue of treating revolutionary discipline with an owner's attitude resolved, some of the confused understandings and practical problems regarding discipline also became easier to solve. Originally, some young workers considered the factory's rules and regulations to be "old frameworks" and "constraints on freedom." After studying, they realized that they could not only seek personal "freedom" but also seek class liberation. Regarding past rules and regulations, a class analysis should be conducted. The entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines promoted by Liu Shaoqi in enterprises, such as material incentives, money as the commander, and the expert path, must be overturned; while revolutionary institutions should only be strengthened, not weakened.

Analyzing real struggles, seeing through the enemy's use of anarchism

Based on the remembrance and comparison education, the Propaganda Team further linked the class struggle in the tram company to the real class struggle, focusing on the education of the current class struggle. This made the broad revolutionary workers further recognize the enemy's sinister plot of using anarchism to attack the proletariat, enhanced their class struggle awareness, and strengthened their sense of responsibility in maintaining revolutionary discipline. After the tram company achieved revolutionary unity, a few unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements used the anarchist tide to incite some workers to violate labor discipline, delay departures, and end services early, or use minor car problems as an excuse not to operate, causing passenger congestion for a period. In the study class, everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Never forget class struggle," linked these living class struggle facts, exposed the enemy's plots, laid out the harm of anarchism, and criticized the reactionary nature of anarchism. The broad revolutionary workers opened their eyes, realizing that anarchism is a means for the bourgeoisie to launch a crazy counterattack against the proletariat. Our struggle against anarchism is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines in the new situation. Some cadres and team leaders who were previously unwilling or afraid to fight against the phenomenon of violating revolutionary discipline felt more deeply that not daring to fight against anarchism is leaving room for the enemy and being irresponsible to the revolution, which is retreating in the struggle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The foreman of the machining group in the repair shop, Yang Shuxin, said: "We must not let the capitalist roaders and ghosts and monsters use anarchism to disrupt the revolution and production. We must consciously observe revolutionary discipline with an owner's attitude, actively maintain revolutionary discipline, and achieve double victories in revolution and production."

Through holding the Mao Zedong Thought study class and focusing on class education, the broad revolutionary workers of the Longshan Tram Company actively maintain revolutionary discipline with an owner's attitude; implement mass dictatorship against a handful of ghosts and monsters who use anarchism to attack socialism; patiently educate and warmly help workers influenced by anarchism; and vigorously publicize good people and good deeds that consciously observe and maintain revolutionary discipline. Some young workers who previously had poor labor discipline have shown significant changes with the help of old workers. The broad revolutionary workers have put forward the battle slogan of "repairing cars and running more cars," launching a wave of grasping revolution and promoting production, with an attendance rate of over 95%. They adhere to eight-hour workdays and have also rushed to repair twenty trams. The team members, with high revolutionary spirit, braved the wind and snow, started early and ended late, ensuring the city's transportation needs.

    长春电车公司在解放军帮助下举办毛泽东思想学习班
    从阶级教育入手引导职工肃清无政府主义思潮影响
    通过回忆对比和联系本单位阶级斗争的实际，广大职工阶级觉悟和革命责任感大大提高，自觉地遵守和维护革命纪律，出勤率达到百分之九十五以上，革命和生产热气腾腾
    本报讯　长春电车公司革命职工，在解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，举办毛泽东思想学习班，从阶级教育入手，肃清无政府主义思潮的影响。广大职工提高了革命责任感，以主人翁的态度，自觉地遵守和维护革命纪律。电车公司的革命、生产出现了一片热气腾腾的景象，成为全市抓革命促生产的一面旗帜。
    长春电车公司担负着市内交通的主要任务。无产阶级文化大革命以来，这个公司的大多数职工坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，遵守革命纪律，坚持八小时工作，坚持业余时间闹革命。但是，一部分职工由于受了无政府主义思潮的影响，存在着“不服管”和“不愿管”的现象。有的职工，特别是一些青年工人，片面强调“打破框框，自己闹革命”，把革命纪律当作“束缚”。在工作时间内，愿来就来，想走就走，爱在那里干就在那里干，不服从调配。对这种破坏革命纪律的行为，有些干部和职工怕惹麻烦，怕“挨轰”，看到了也听之任之，不进行教育，不加抵制，不敢斗争。这种情形影响了革命和生产的正常进行。
    毛泽东思想宣传队，经过深入的调查分析，认为要帮助职工克服无政府主义思潮的影响，不能就事论事，最好的办法是举办毛泽东思想学习班，从根本上提高职工的阶级觉悟，牢固地树立主人翁思想，增强革命责任感。
    通过回忆对比，加强主人翁的责任感
    林副主席说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”又说：“‘两忆三查’是最好的最深刻的政治教育，是提高部队阶级觉悟的好办法。”宣传队根据林副主席的指示，在学习班里，大抓阶级教育，组织职工开展了“三忆三比”活动：忆在旧社会受资本家残酷剥削压迫的苦，比解放后翻身做主人的甜；忆党的培养教育，比自己的社会主义劳动态度；忆毛主席对无产阶级革命派的希望，比自己执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的表现。
    一提起新旧社会的对比，老工人们都非常激动。他们说：在旧社会，电车公司是一座活地狱。反动派和资本家为了榨取工人的血汗，订了几百条厂规，强迫工人一天干十几个小时，连上厕所都限制时间和次数。稍稍触犯了厂规，轻者扣工钱、挨皮鞭，重者遭开除，蹲班房。工人根本没有半点自由。解放以后，工人才翻了身，当家做主人，掌握了自己的命运。现在，我们干活，是为人民服务，是为社会主义革命和建设。
    老工人们解放前后两种不同的遭遇，是阶级教育的活教材，使广大职工，尤其是生长在新社会的青年工人，受到了深刻的阶级教育。许多工人自觉地检查了自己的劳动态度。有个青年女司机，原来被分配在干线上跑车，她觉得太苦太累，就私自到支线上去跑车。在老工人忆苦思甜的启示下，她回忆了自己在旧社会沿街讨饭的苦难童年，流着眼泪说：“毛主席和党中央号召我们工人阶级要做抓革命、促生产的模范，做遵守劳动纪律的模范，我却中了无政府主义的毒，贪图轻松，不服从调配，影响了革命和生产，实在是辜负了毛主席对咱工人的期望。”
    宣传队同志又进一步组织职工学习了毛主席的教导：“纪律是执行路线的保证，没有纪律，党就无法率领群众与军队进行胜利的斗争。”经过学习、讨论，大家认识到，纪律是为阶级利益服务的。资本家的纪律，是压迫劳动人民、维护资产阶级统治的纪律；社会主义劳动纪律，是革命的纪律，是社会主义建设的必要保证，是维护工人阶级的利益的。我们工人阶级是国家的主人，应该以主人翁的态度对待革命纪律，以深厚的阶级感情热爱革命纪律，以高度的革命自觉遵守革命纪律。大家说：“我们是跟着毛主席建设社会主义的，只能自觉地遵守革命纪律，为社会主义建设垒砖添瓦，不能破坏革命纪律，拆社会主义的墙脚。闹无政府主义，破坏革命纪律，就会干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是对毛主席不忠！”
    要以主人翁的态度自觉遵守革命纪律这一根本问题解决了，一些对纪律问题的糊涂认识和实际问题，也就容易解决了。原来一些青年工人把厂里的规章制度，一概认为是“旧框框”，“束缚自由”。经过学习后认识到，不能只求个人的“自由”，要求阶级的解放。对于过去的规章制度要作阶级分析。中国赫鲁晓夫在企业中推行的一整套反革命修正主义路线，如物质刺激、金钱挂帅、专家路线等等，一定要反掉；而革命的制度，只能加强，不能削弱。
    分析现实斗争，看穿阶级敌人利用无政府主义的阴谋
    在忆比教育的基础上，宣传队又联系电车公司阶级斗争的实际，大抓了现实阶级斗争的教育，使广大革命职工进一步认清了敌人利用无政府主义向无产阶级进攻的罪恶阴谋，提高了阶级斗争观念，增强了自觉维护革命纪律的责任感。电车公司实现革命大联合以后，有几个没有改造好的地、富、反、坏分子，利用无政府主义思潮，煽动部分工人破坏劳动纪律，晚出车，早收车，或者借口电车有点小毛病就不出车，一度造成了乘客拥挤等现象。在学习班里，大家学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，联系这些活生生的阶级斗争事实，大揭阶级敌人的阴谋，大摆无政府主义的危害，大批无政府主义的反动性。广大革命职工擦亮了眼睛，认识到无政府主义是当前资产阶级向无产阶级进行疯狂反扑的一种手段。我们同无政府主义的斗争，是在新形势下两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。一些原来对破坏革命纪律的现象不愿管、不敢斗争的干部和班组长，更深刻地感到，对无政府主义不敢斗争，就是给敌人留空子，对革命不负责任，就是在保卫毛主席革命路线的斗争中怯了阵。大修厂的钳工组长杨树新说：“我们决不能让走资派、牛鬼蛇神，利用无政府主义破坏革命和生产。我们一定要以主人翁的态度自觉遵守革命纪律，积极维护革命纪律，夺取革命、生产双胜利。”
    通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，大抓阶级教育，长春电车公司广大革命职工积极以主人翁态度维护革命纪律；对利用无政府主义向社会主义进攻的一小撮牛鬼蛇神，实行了群众专政；对一些受无政府主义影响的工人，进行了耐心教育和热情帮助；对自觉遵守和维护革命纪律的好人好事大力宣扬。一些原来劳动纪律较差的青年职工，在老工人帮助下，也都有了明显的转变。广大革命职工提出了“修好车、多出车”的战斗口号，掀起了抓革命促生产的热潮，出勤率达到百分之九十五以上。他们坚持八小时工作，还突击抢修了二十台电车。车队同志以高度的革命精神，冒风雪严寒，早出车，晚收车，保证了市内交通的需要。
