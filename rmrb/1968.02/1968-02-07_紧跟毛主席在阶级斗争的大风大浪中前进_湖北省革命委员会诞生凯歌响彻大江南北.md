Marching Forward in the Stormy Waves of Class Struggle Under Chairman Mao's Guidance: The Birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee

The winds of revolution sweep through the three towns of Wuhan, red flags fluttering everywhere. Over seventy thousand soldiers and civilians gathered to celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

New China News Agency, Wuhan, February 6th: In the midst of the nationwide march by hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought echoes from the heroic city of Wuhan with a glorious revolutionary tradition: the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born in the stormy waves of class struggle!

From the very beginning, the proletarian cultural revolution in Hubei has received great concern and timely guidance from our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao. At every critical moment in the struggle, it is Chairman Mao who has pointed the way, and it is the radiant Mao Zedong Thought that has illuminated the path forward.

The great concern of Chairman Mao has greatly inspired and encouraged the heroic sons and daughters of Hubei. Over the past year, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fought unyieldingly and bravely, and achieved decisive victories in the proletarian cultural revolution.

"Winds rise, the turtles and snakes are still. Great plans are made." On February 5th, the capital of Hubei, Wuhan, was in a state of jubilation. Over seventy thousand revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army from all fronts across the province, carrying the giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao and holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," surged from all directions towards the central venue in Hankou and various venues in Wuchang, Hankou, Qingshan, and other places, solemnly celebrating the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

The celebration began to the majestic tune of "The East is Red." When the committee's formal establishment was announced, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause and joyous cheers. People raised their shining red revolutionary books and shouted in ecstasy, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

On the day of celebrating the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, from the southern slopes of the Dabie Mountains to the northern shores of Lake Dongting, from the northwestern mountains of Hubei to the Jianghan Plain, red flags fluttered and joy filled the air. The 32 million heroic sons and daughters of the province expressed their shared wish from the bottom of their hearts: "Wishing our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The glorious birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee marks the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Tao Zhu and Wang Renshu in Hubei, and the complete defeat of their evil plot to restore capitalism.

The 32 million heroic sons and daughters of Hubei, who are infinitely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, have always followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasped the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, regardless of whether they were facing difficulties in the struggle or celebrating victories. This is their source of strength and the fundamental guarantee of their victories.

Since the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution began, the revolutionary people of Hubei have followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "You should pay attention to state affairs and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end," forming a vast revolutionary army. They fearlessly resisted the brutal suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, overcame all difficulties, persisted in the struggle, and launched fierce attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionists like Wang Renshu and seizing back the power they had usurped.

When Chairman Mao inspected the North China, Central South, and East China regions, he issued a series of extremely important latest instructions. The revolutionary people of Hubei quickly launched a wave of studying, propagating, implementing, and carrying out the latest instructions. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes sprang up across cities and countryside, becoming more numerous and better organized. The entire province became a vast school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, with the broad revolutionary masses enthusiastically promoting good study habits, focusing on criticizing and repudiating revisionism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, breaking down bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, promoting revolutionary great alliances, boldly liberating cadres, rapidly advancing revolutionary tripartite alliances, and vigorously promoting production. The revolutionary situation was excellent.

At the critical moment of fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Hubei, the broad soldiers and officers of the Wuhan garrison of the People's Liberation Army stood up bravely and valiantly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They followed the great instructions of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and adhered to the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions." They conducted thorough and detailed political and ideological work, propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses, helped the revolutionary masses implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions took root among the masses and were implemented in every unit. They achieved great merits in the "three supports, two militaries" work.

The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army participating in the celebration were warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. The venue was filled with a moving scene of military-civilian unity. During the meeting, the revolutionary masses repeatedly shouted, "Learn from the PLA! Salute to the PLA!"

Comrade Zhang Siyu, the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said, "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We proletarian revolutionaries seized power relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and to wield power well, we also rely on Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously emphasize proletarian politics, and carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply. We must genuinely organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promote the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, study and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions well, ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented in every aspect in Hubei, and make Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and policies directly grasped by the broad masses of the people, turning them into conscious revolutionary actions.

Comrade Zhang Siyu said, in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, the standard for judging whether one is a leftist is whether one acts according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must thoroughly repudiate the bourgeois "self" and establish the proletarian "public," overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, continuously strengthen proletarian party spirit, and be vigilant against class enemies using factionalism to disrupt and interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Comrade Zhang Siyu said, we must correctly handle cadres and correctly handle the masses, gradually achieving unity with more than 95% of cadres and masses, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary tripartite alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, rectify the Party's organization, and strengthen Party building. The Communist Youth League, Red Guards, and various revolutionary mass organizations should be rectified in terms of ideology and organization. We must enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," launching a new high tide of supporting the army and loving the people, and be vigilant against class enemies inciting military-civilian relations and disrupting military-civilian unity. We must further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," starting from promoting ideological revolutionization, ensuring greater development in industrial and agricultural production in 1968. We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, continue to make efforts, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization, turning Hubei into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Comrade Liu Feng, political commissar of the Wuhan garrison and vice chairman of the provincial revolutionary committee, spoke on behalf of the Wuhan garrison leadership and all soldiers and officers, expressing the warmest congratulations on the birth of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee and pledging to firmly uphold its proletarian revolutionary authority. He said, the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are our source of strength and the fundamental guarantee of our victories. The broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses are our teachers and also our close comrades-in-arms. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we must learn from the heroic examples and advanced experiences of the Fourth Platoon, Comrade Li Wenzhong, and the 8341st Unit, humbly learn from the broad revolutionary masses, adhere to the principle of "supporting the left, not the factions," further do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, and make new contributions in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

Comrade Zhang Tixue, vice chairman of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said, through more than a year of the proletarian cultural revolution, he had received an extremely profound class education and deeply realized that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is infinitely wise and great. He pledged to take "Four Old Articles" as his motto, take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key, study Chairman Mao's works actively and apply them to solve problems, transform his worldview, study until old age, transform until old age, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. He also pledged to humbly learn from the revolutionary masses, be a lifelong student of the masses, and a lifelong servant of the people. He would work hard with the broad revolutionary masses to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions comprehensively, achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, and make new contributions to the people.

Comrade Fang Ming, chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and Comrade Wang Genyuan, deputy commander of the Hubei Military Region, successively spoke at the meeting, expressing warm congratulations and firm support for the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

Representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards from the Wuhan region and various parts of Hubei spoke at the meeting with revolutionary enthusiasm. They unanimously expressed: Under the leadership of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key, carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, continue to organize and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, resolutely overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, establish proletarian party spirit, further deepen the revolutionary great criticism, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary tripartite alliance, deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions comprehensively, achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, and forever advance along the revolutionary course opened by our great leader Chairman Mao.
