The People's Liberation Army's 6810 Unit, in its support-left work in Jiangxi's Gan South region, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhered to the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions, and conducted thorough and detailed political and ideological work among the broad masses. This has contributed to the victory of the Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi and yielded good experiences.

Their fundamental experience is:

1. In vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they focus on the character "loyalty." They ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented and used to guide the broad revolutionary masses to follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, taking this as the direction for support-left work.

When this unit first arrived in Ganzhou City, they learned that due to the sabotage and blockade by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the masses had difficulty hearing Chairman Mao's voice. In this situation, they firmly believed that in the old revolutionary base, the proletarian revolutionary faction is the most loyal to Chairman Mao, and even the deceived masses love Chairman Mao. As long as Chairman Mao's voice is propagated, the masses can be guided to the direction of the struggle. Therefore, as soon as they arrived in Ganzhou, they immediately organized 22 propaganda teams, printed tens of millions of propaganda materials, and distributed them deeply into factories and rural areas, sparking a high tide of propaganda for Chairman Mao's voice. In the propaganda, they focused on the character "loyalty." Initially, some deceived masses did not understand, so they helped the deceived masses recall the decades-long revolutionary struggle with Chairman Mao, recognizing that whenever they were loyal to Chairman Mao and followed Chairman Mao, they were victorious; whenever they deviated from Mao Zedong Thought, they made mistakes.

In this way, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, successively launching four major propaganda high tides. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3 million people have been educated by their propaganda.

2. Focusing on the masses and taking root at the grassroots level. The unit's Party Committee believes that to make political and ideological work exert great power, the key is to do a good job of mass work. They say, "With the masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything." This is their long-term experience in learning and implementing Chairman Mao's teachings. Under this guiding ideology, as soon as they arrived, they quickly took root at the grassroots level, did the masses' work, propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses, organized the masses, and educated the masses.

Their specific approach is: in a region, first focus on the political and economic center areas such as factories and schools at the grassroots level. Once the situation in the region improves, immediately shift to the county; once the problems in the county are solved, shift to the commune and production teams. Use the situation in the political and economic center to influence the lower levels, and at the same time, use the situation from the lower levels to promote the upper levels.

By doing political and ideological work among the masses, the masses gain the ability to resist the interference of non-proletarian thoughts and fight against the direction of the struggle, thus greatly promoting the rapid improvement of the situation.

This unit not only mobilized the broad ranks of officers and soldiers, with everyone doing political and ideological work, and mobilized the proletarian revolutionary faction to do political and ideological work, but also mobilized the awakened deceived masses to do political and ideological work. In this way, all possible forces were mobilized.

3. In everything, they pay attention to passing on the traditions, experiences, and methods of the army's political and ideological work to the local areas, leaving behind a propaganda team that never leaves. The unit's Party Committee believes that in support-left work, in addition to directly propagating Chairman Mao's voice and vigorously doing the masses' political and ideological work, the most important thing is to grasp the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works. After the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, the army's primary task is to pass on the experience and methods of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to them, pass on the "four firsts" to them, and pass on the "three-eights" style to them. Only then can they wield power well and use power well. At the same time, the support-left troops will eventually leave, passing on the army's good traditions, good experiences, and good styles to them is like leaving behind a propaganda team that never leaves, leaving behind propaganda cadres who never leave.

Therefore, they always pay attention to passing on experiences, leaving traditions, and bringing along cadres. For example, as soon as a leading cadre is established, they first educate them to prioritize the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, help them establish a study system, and grasp the "four firsts." Now, many good experiences and traditions of the army have taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit among the people of Gan South.

4. Using the army's revolutionization to drive the masses' revolutionization, and using the masses' revolutionization to further promote the army's revolutionization, using the two revolutionizations to mutually promote each other, and pushing the movement to continuously move forward.

The unit's Party Committee, in accordance with Comrade Lin Biao's instruction that "personal conduct is more important than words," has always unswervingly educated the officers and soldiers to influence the masses with their actions and set an example for the proletarian revolutionary faction with their model behavior. They believe that the support-left troops generally should not stay too long at the lower levels and should periodically return to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply understand the spirit of the latest instructions, check whether they have firmly implemented and fully implemented them in support-left work, summarize experiences, and commend good people and good deeds. Therefore, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have always maintained high fighting spirit. They also continuously educate the broad ranks of soldiers to humbly learn from the masses, regard the proletarian revolutionary faction as their teacher. When they achieve great success in support-left work, the masses praise them, and the leading organs commend them, the unit's Party Committee immediately issues a decision on "studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, taking 'fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism' as the key, preventing and overcoming arrogance and complacency," and conducts an open rectification. In this way, the army's ideological revolutionization is greatly promoted.

The army's ideological revolutionization drives the masses' revolutionization. For example, some leaders of revolutionary organizations are afraid of being criticized in study classes and dare not expose their selfishness and criticize it. The army's open rectification, taking the lead in exposing selfishness and criticizing it, greatly promotes their active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, promoting ideological revolutionization.

    深入细致地做好思想政治工作
    六八一○部队的经验是：狠抓一个“忠”字，用毛主席的最新指示引导广大革命群众；着眼于群众，把思想政治工作做到群众中去；把部队抓思想政治工作的传统、经验、方法传给地方；以部队革命化带动群众革命化，以群众革命化促进部队革命化
    本报讯　中国人民解放军六八一○部队，在江西赣南地区支左工作中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持支左不支派的原则，对广大群众做深入、细致的思想政治工作，对江西的文化大革命的胜利进展作出了贡献，取得了很好的经验。
    他们的根本经验是：
    一、在大力宣传毛泽东思想、毛主席最新指示中，狠抓一个“忠”字，做到毛主席的最新指示条条落实，全面落实，用毛主席的最新指示，引导广大革命群众，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，作为支左工作的方向。
    这个部队刚到赣州市时，了解到由于党内一小撮走资派的破坏和封锁，群众中难以听到毛主席的声音。在这种情况下，他们坚信在老根据地不仅无产阶级革命派最忠于毛主席，即使受蒙蔽的群众也是热爱毛主席的。只要宣传毛主席的声音，就能把群众引导到斗争大方向上去。于是一到赣州就立即组织了二十二个宣传队，印了几百万份宣传材料，深入工厂农村散发，掀起一个宣传毛主席声音的高潮。在宣传中，他们狠抓一个“忠”字。起初，部分受蒙蔽群众想不通，他们就帮助受蒙蔽群众回忆几十年跟着毛主席干革命的战斗历程，认识到什么时候忠于毛主席、紧跟毛主席，就是胜利；什么时候偏离了毛泽东思想，就要犯错误。
    就这样，他们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，先后掀起四次大宣传高潮，据不完全统计，受到他们宣传教育的群众达三百万人次以上。
    二、着眼群众、扎根基层。部队党委认为：要使思想政治工作发挥巨大的威力，主要靠做好群众工作。他们说：“有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的群众，就有了一切。”这是他们长期学习和贯彻毛主席教导的体会。在这种思想指导下，他们一来到这里就迅速扎根到基层，做群众的工作，用毛主席的最新指示宣传群众，组织群众，教育群众。
    他们的具体做法是：在一个地区先抓政治经济中心区的工厂、学校等基层群众。地区的形势好转了，就立即转到县；县里的问题解决了，又转到公社、生产队。用政治经济中心的形势去影响下边，同时，又用下面的形势去促上面。
    思想政治工作做到群众中去，群众就有了抵制非无产阶级思想干扰斗争大方向的能力，从而大大地推动了形势迅速好转。
    这个部队不仅发动了广大的指战员，人人做思想政治工作，发动无产阶级革命派做思想政治工作，也发动觉悟了的受蒙蔽的群众做思想政治工作。这样，就调动了一切可以调动的力量。
    三、事事注意把部队抓思想政治工作的传统、经验、方法，传给地方，留下一个不走的宣传队。这个部队的党委认为：支左工作除了直接宣传毛主席的声音，大力做好群众的思想政治工作外，最重要的是抓活学活用毛主席著作。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，部队的头等任务，就是把活学活用毛主席著作的经验、方法传给他们，把四个第一传给他们，把三八作风传给他们，这样他们才能掌好权、用好权。同时，支左部队毕竟是要走的，把部队的那套好传统、好经验、好作风传给他们，就是留下不走的宣传队，留下了不走的宣传员。
    因此，他们时时处处注意传经验，留传统，带班子。如领导班子一建立，首先教育他们把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，帮助他们建立学习制度，抓四个第一。现在部队很多好经验、好传统，已经在赣南群众中扎根、开花、结果。
    四、以部队革命化带动群众革命化，以群众的革命化再促部队的革命化，用两个革命化互相促进，推动运动不断向前发展。
    这个部队的党委遵照林副主席提出的身教重于言教的指示，始终不渝地教育指战员以自己的行动来影响群众，以自己的模范行为为无产阶级革命派树立榜样。他们认为支左部队一般在下边的时间不宜太长，要定期回来学习毛主席的最新指示，深刻领会最新指示的精神，检查在支左工作中是否坚决照办，全面落实，总结经验，表彰好人好事。因此，广大指战员始终保持着高昂的战斗精神。他们还不断教育广大战士虚心向群众学习，拜无产阶级革命派为师，在支左工作取得很大成绩，群众赞扬，领导机关也表扬的时候，部队党委立即作出关于“学习毛主席的最新指示，以‘斗私，批修’为纲，防止和克服骄傲自满情绪”的决定，并且开门整风。这样大大促进了部队的思想革命化。
    部队的思想革命化，带动了群众的革命化。如某些革命组织的负责人，在学习班怕被人家抓小辫子，不敢亮私、斗私。部队开门整风，带头亮私斗私，大大推动他们活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，促进了思想革命化。
