The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a "Circular on Continuing to Strengthen Planned Management and Improve the Responsibility System in State-Owned Factories and Mines in Northeast China" on June 23. The circular first cites examples to illustrate that since most state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China (excluding light industry and local state-owned industry) launched discussions among employees on the national plan in April and carried out work to strengthen planned management, production has begun to improve. Many leading cadres of enterprises have further paid attention to studying economic knowledge and have meticulously studied enterprise management business, which has prepared the conditions for improving enterprise management level and ensuring the comprehensive and balanced completion of the plan in the future.

Secondly, the circular pointed out that the planned management work of state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China still generally has three weaknesses: slow progress, unbalanced development, and lagging political work. Most factories and mines did not end the preparation stage until May, clarifying the requirements and methods for strengthening planned management work among cadres, and finding out the specific and key problems existing in their units. Among the factories, a few enterprises with faster progress (mainly some enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and some enterprises in Shenyang under the Second Ministry of Machinery Industry) have fully prepared, mobilized the masses to solve some key problems, and initially improved planned management work, achieving remarkable results in promoting production. However, most provinces and cities and most enterprises have just finished their preparations. Some enterprises are still watching from the sidelines or have just begun to brew preparations, and there are still many ideological obstacles. At the same time, in the entire preparation process for strengthening planned management, most enterprises have not carried out strong political work, and some party and trade union cadres in enterprises do not know what they should do and where to start.

The circular pointed out that there are roughly two approaches to the current work of strengthening planned management in factories and mines. One approach is that the leading cadres in the enterprise earnestly organized cadres to study the instructions from higher authorities and other relevant documents on planned management, so that cadres clearly understood the purpose, requirements, and methods of strengthening planned management. At the same time, the department staff organized, focusing on improving operation plans to achieve rhythmic production, thoroughly investigated the relevant economic quotas, records and statistics, and responsibility systems related to planned management, analyzed and researched them, and found out the main factors that could not achieve rhythmic production according to the operation plan. In this way, they clearly grasped the central link of planned management (such as Factory 53). The other approach is that there is a lack of serious study and research on the instructions from higher authorities and relevant documents on planned management, the purpose and specific methods of strengthening planned management are not clear, and although some investigations have been made on the specific situation of the enterprise, the investigations and research are not carried out with the goal of improving the operation plan to achieve rhythmic production; therefore, some emphasize first engaging in original records, some emphasize first engaging in the responsibility system, some emphasize engaging in operating procedures, and some assign these tasks to the relevant departments to proceed simultaneously. As a result, the unbalanced completion of the plan in these enterprises has not been improved. Because the central link of strengthening planned management is not clearly understood and the key problems of the enterprise have not been grasped, the mobilization of the masses lacks specific direction, and the result is that: some only have a few cadres moving while the workers do not move; some generally put forward empty competition slogans such as promoting advanced experience, improving labor discipline, and ensuring the completion of tasks; some routinely mobilize the masses to sign collective contracts, which cannot be closely combined with the current work of strengthening planned management. Administrative cadres complain: "The mass movement is an obstacle to planned management," and party and trade union cadres reflect: "Political work cannot be combined with this kind of strengthening of planned management."

The circular analyzed the current situation and pointed out that although the current work of strengthening planned management in state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China has received some achievements, it is still far from meeting the requirements of strengthening planned management. According to the statistics of 130 enterprises in May, 37 percent completed the plan in the first half of the month, and 56.4 percent completed the plan in the second half of the month. This shows that more than half of the enterprises still cannot complete the plan on a monthly basis, and the phenomenon of being loose in the beginning and tight at the end is still quite serious. Therefore, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee put forward the following requirements to state-owned factories and mines:

1. In order to improve the level of enterprise management and improve the current production outlook, it is necessary to seriously persist in strengthening planned management work, do it practically, and not allow it to be abandoned halfway. (Light industry and local industry should continue to concentrate their efforts on technical management work, and strive to achieve significant improvements in product quality within this year.) For a few enterprises with faster progress, key problems have been broken through, and planned management work has been initially improved, they are required to continue to deeply mobilize the masses, and on the basis of strengthening planned management, establish and improve the production responsibility system in a more systematic way (especially the production scheduling responsibility system, equipment maintenance and repair responsibility system, technical security responsibility system, and material and tool supply responsibility system), improve workshop production organization, and organize rhythmic production as much as possible according to the instruction charts, so as to consolidate the results achieved. For most enterprises that have completed their preparation work, they are required to quickly mobilize the masses, check and solve the key problems in production item by item, and compile advanced operation plans that are practical, and in combination with the compilation and implementation of operation plans, establish the necessary responsibility system, and lay a more solid foundation for the comprehensive and balanced completion of the national plan. For a part of the enterprises that have just started preparing, they are required to quickly change their passive waiting attitude, seriously study the instructions from higher authorities, clarify the purpose and specific methods of planned management, accept the experience of advanced enterprises, avoid the groping process in carrying out this work, and quickly catch up. In view of the serious situation of mechanical equipment and personal accidents this year, all enterprises must arrange a certain amount of time to conduct a major security inspection and establish and improve the security responsibility system.

2. The purpose of strengthening planned management is to achieve the comprehensive and balanced completion of the national plan, and doing a good job in the operation plan is the central link in doing a good job in planned management. The current lack of planning in enterprises is generally not a lack of production, financial, and technical plans approved by the state, but a lack of practical and perfect operation plans. Whether the operation plan is correct or not depends on whether the various quotas and original records are accurate. Therefore, in the process of compiling the operation plan, it is necessary to earnestly mobilize the masses to explore advanced quotas, and at the same time strengthen original records and statistics work, so as to accurately study the average advanced quotas, compile accurate and feasible operation plans, and compile technical organization measures plans according to the key problems existing in production and the rationalization proposals of the masses to ensure the timely realization of the operation plan. In the process of implementing the operation plan, establishing and improving the responsibility system becomes the primary task. In particular, establishing and improving production scheduling agencies from top to bottom and strengthening the work of production management functional agencies is the most central link; otherwise, an accurate operation plan will not be realized due to the lagging production of a certain section or a certain group or the maladjustment of the work of a certain functional agency or a certain auxiliary department. To make the operation plan practical, each enterprise must put forward different requirements according to different production objects, different work foundations, and different key production problems. When formulating the operation plan, we must fully estimate the advanced experience of the masses, and at the same time pay attention to overcoming the weak links in various aspects, and pay attention to the connection and cooperation of various aspects. For each task in planned management, we must carefully study its primary and secondary relationship according to the instructions from higher authorities and the specific situation of the enterprise, and seek organic combination and implementation. It is inappropriate to proceed simultaneously without distinguishing between primary and secondary; it is also incorrect to emphasize one item in isolation without taking care of other aspects; and it is also incorrect to attempt to solve all key problems at once, or to make excessive demands on each problem.

3. Strengthening planned management is to solve the current state of confusion in production. Because the state of confusion in production is mainly caused by the weakness of enterprise planned management. The view and practice of opposing the strengthening of planned management and the completion of the national plan, and the attitude of passively emphasizing the difficulty of strengthening planned management under the pretext of completing the current production tasks, and not daring to start or unwilling to start, is wrong. This is a manifestation of not understanding the spirit of the instructions from higher authorities and not understanding the specific situation of the enterprise, and in fact, is a manifestation of bureaucracy and formalism. Strengthening planned management requires us to deeply discover the key problems in current production and solve them seriously and thoroughly; therefore, we must consolidate and implement them from the aspects of record statistics, various systems, and accurate operation plans. Because many of our enterprises currently have the more common phenomena of bureaucracy and lack of responsibility in management, as well as departmentalism and handicraft-style work, this has formed the state of confusion in production. Therefore, to strengthen planned management, we must strengthen the concept of planning and the concept of the overall situation among the management personnel of the enterprise, establish a scientific and realistic work style, and oppose various erroneous ideas and styles that are contrary to this. At the same time, in strengthening planned management, the provincial and municipal party committees must study and improve the leadership methods of enterprise political work, rationally allocate the time for employees' spare time activities, and gradually overcome the phenomenon of "five more" in enterprises.

4. Whether planned management can be implemented depends on whether the masses can be comprehensively mobilized with leadership, especially the full mobilization of the staff and technicians of the departments and offices. In the preparation stage of strengthening planned management work, it is necessary to mobilize staff and technicians to closely combine with workers, collect data, and study key problems in production. After grasping the key problems, it is necessary to mobilize employees to think of ways to break through the key. The compilation and implementation of operation plans, the sorting and improvement of original records, and the breakthrough and adherence of quotas must be mobilized for employees to discuss and revise and study how to implement them. The establishment and implementation of each system must be mobilized for technicians and staff to use their brains and hands, and implemented after being discussed and revised by workers. Therefore, for each key problem and each work stage, we must pay close attention to the thinking of employees, pay attention to establishing advanced role models among the employees, carry out education on advanced ideas, especially pay attention to strengthening the education of "the national plan is the law," strengthening the education of labor discipline, criticizing various backward ideas, and consolidating and improving attendance rates to ensure the implementation of the operation plan. For technicians and staff, we must encourage their strong sense of enterprise, commend the advanced models among them, and criticize their attitude of being divorced from reality, divorced from workers, and shirking responsibility and refusing to be responsible when things happen.

On the basis of strengthening planned management, we must mobilize employees to carry out labor competitions. All enterprises must deeply examine and summarize the experiences and lessons of implementing the national plan in the first half of the year, discuss the goals for the second half of the year, stipulate specific measures, mobilize the masses to carry out labor competitions, learn and promote advanced experience, strengthen labor discipline, and ensure the comprehensive, balanced, and early completion of the national plan, so as to lay a good foundation for the early completion of the country's first five-year construction plan.

    中共中央东北局指示东北各国营厂矿
    继续加强计划管理工作和健全责任制度
    中共中央东北局六月二十三日发出“关于国营厂矿继续加强计划管理工作和健全责任制度的通报”。通报中首先举出实例，说明东北地区多数国营厂矿（不包括轻工业和地方国营工业），从四月份发动职工讨论国家计划，开展了加强计划管理工作以来，生产情况随之开始好转，不少企业的领导干部已进一步注意了学习经济知识，比较细致地钻研了企业管理的业务，给今后提高企业管理水平、保证全面地均衡地完成计划准备了条件。
    其次，通报指出：东北地区各国营厂矿计划管理工作还较普遍地存在着进展迟缓、发展不平衡、政治工作跟不上三个弱点。多数厂矿到五月才开始结束准备工作阶段，在干部中明确了加强计划管理工作的要求与做法，摸清了本单位存在的具体问题和关键问题。在各厂之间，进展较快的少数企业（主要是重工业部所属的一些企业及第二机械工业部在沈阳的一些企业），经过充分的准备工作后，已发动群众解决了一些关键问题，初步改进了计划管理工作，在推动生产上取得了显著的成绩。而多数省市和多数企业，才刚刚结束准备工作。有一部分企业尚在观望不前或刚刚开始酝酿准备，思想上的阻力还比较多。同时，在整个加强计划管理的准备过程中，大部分企业没有进行强有力的政治工作，有些企业的党与工会工作干部还不知道自己应该作什么，从哪里作起。
    通报指出：各厂矿这次加强计划管理的工作，大体有两种做法。一种做法是企业中的领导干部认真组织干部学习了上级指示及其他有关计划管理的文件，使干部明确认识了加强计划管理的目的、要求与做法。同时组织科室人员，以改进作业计划实现有节奏的生产为中心，深入地调查了有关计划管理的各项经济定额、记录统计、责任制度等情况，进行分析研究，从中找出不能按作业计划实现有节奏生产的主要因素。这样，就明确地抓住了计划管理的中心环节（如五三工厂）。另一种做法是对上级的指示和有关计划管理的文件缺乏认真的学习研究，对加强计划管理的目的和具体做法不明确，对本企业的具体情况虽然也做了一些调查，但不是从改进作业计划以实现有节奏生产为中心去进行调查研究；于是有的强调先搞原始记录，有的强调先搞责任制度，有的则强调搞操作规程，有的则是把这几项工作交给有关科室齐头并进。因而这些企业在进行计划管理当中，完成计划的不均衡情况并没有得到改进。由于对加强计划管理的中心环节认识不明确，没有抓住本企业的关键问题，因而发动群众就缺乏具体方向，其结果是：有的只是少数干部动而职工不动；有的则一般化地提出推广先进经验、提高劳动纪律、保证完成任务等空洞的竞赛口号；有的则例行公事地发动群众签订集体合同，同当前的加强计划管理工作不能紧密结合。行政干部埋怨：“群众运动是计划管理的障碍”，党与工会的干部则反映：“这样加强计划管理，政治工作无法结合”。
    通报中分析了当前的情况，指出东北地区国营厂矿这次加强计划管理的工作，虽然收到一些成绩，但还远没有达到加强计划管理的要求。据五月份一百三十个企业统计，上半月完成计划的占百分之三十七，下半月完成计划的占百分之五十六点四。这说明了还有半数以上的企业不能按月完成计划，而且前松后紧的现象仍相当严重。因此，中共中央东北局对各国营厂矿提出了以下几项要求：
    一、为了提高企业管理水平，改善目前的生产面貌，必须认真地把加强计划管理的工作坚持进行下去，切实搞好，不许半途而废。（轻工业和地方工业应继续集中力量做好技术管理工作，务求在今年一年内切实在产品质量上得到显著提高）对于少数进展较快，关键问题已经突破，计划管理工作已有初步改进的企业，要求继续深入地发动群众，在加强计划管理的基础上，比较有系统地建立与健全生产责任制度（特别是生产调度责任制、设备维护与检修责任制、技术保安责任制、材料和工具供应责任制等），改进车间生产组织，尽可能作到按指示图表组织有节奏生产，以巩固已取得的成果。对于多数已经完成准备工作的企业，要求迅速发动群众，根据生产上的关键问题，逐项地边检查边解决，并编制出切合实际的先进作业计划，结合着编制与贯彻作业计划，建立必要的责任制度，给全面地均衡地完成国家计划打下较稳固的基础。对于一部分刚刚进行准备工作的企业，要求他们迅速改变消极等待的不正确态度，认真学习上级指示，明确计划管理的目的和具体做法，接受先进企业的经验，避免进行这一工作中的摸索过程，迅速地赶上去。鉴于今年机械设备和人身事故比较严重的情况，所有企业都必须安排一定时间，进行一次保安大检查，建立和健全保安责任制。
    二、加强计划管理的目的是为了做到均衡地全面地完成国家计划，而搞好作业计划，则是搞好计划管理的中心环节。目前企业中的缺乏计划性，一般不是缺少经国家批准的生产、财务、技术计划，而是缺乏切合实际的完善的作业计划。作业计划的正确与否，关键又在于各项定额及原始记录是否准确。因此在作业计划的编制过程中，要认真地发动群众挖掘先进定额，同时加强原始记录和统计工作，以便准确地研究平均先进定额，编制出确切可行的作业计划，并根据生产上存在的关键问题及群众的合理化建议，编制技术组织措施计划,以保证作业计划按时实现。在作业计划的贯彻过程中，建立和健全责任制度就成为首要任务。特别是从上到下地建立和健全生产调度机构和加强生产管理职能机构的工作，是最中心的一环，否则准确的作业计划会因某一工段某一小组的生产落后或某一职能机构某一辅助部门的工作失调而无法实现。要做到使作业计划切合实际，各企业必须根据不同的生产对象，不同的工作基础，不同的生产关键问题，提出不同的要求。制订作业计划时要充分估计到群众的先进经验，同时要注意克服各方面的薄弱环节，注意各方面的联系和配合。对于计划管理中的每项工作，必须根据上级指示及本企业的具体情况细心研究其主从关系，求得有机地结合进行，不分主次的齐头并进的做法是不妥当的；孤立地强调一项而不照顾其他方面也是不正确的；而企图一下解决所有的关键问题，或对每项问题都提出过高的要求，也是不正确的。
    三、加强计划管理，就是为了解决当前生产上的混乱状态。因为生产上的混乱状态，主要是由于企业的计划管理薄弱所造成的。那种将加强计划管理与完成国家计划对立起来的看法与做法，借口完成当前生产任务，消极地强调加强计划管理的困难，而不敢下手或不愿下手的态度，是错误的。这是没有领会上级指示的精神和不了解本企业的具体情况，实际上是官僚主义和形式主义的一种表现。加强计划管理，正是要求我们深入发现当前生产上的关键问题，认真彻底地加以解决；因此，就要求从记录统计上，从各种制度上，从确切的作业计划上加以巩固和贯彻。由于我们许多企业在管理中目前较普遍地存在着官僚主义和无人负责现象以及本位主义和手工业作风，才形成了生产上的混乱状态。因此，要加强计划管理，必须在企业的管理人员中加强计划观念，加强整体思想，树立科学的实事求是的工作作风，反对与此相反的各种错误思想和作风。同时，在加强计划管理中，各省市委须研究改善企业政治工作的领导方法，合理地支配职工业余活动时间，逐步地克服企业中的“五多”现象。
    四、计划管理能否贯彻，在于能否有领导地全面地发动群众，特别是充分发动科、室的职员和技术人员。在加强计划管理工作的准备阶段，要发动职员和技术人员与工人密切结合，搜集资料，研究生产上的关键问题。抓住关键问题之后，要发动职工想办法突破关键。作业计划的编制与执行，原始记录的整理和改进，定额的突破和坚持，都要发动职工讨论修正和研究如何贯彻。每种制度的建立和贯彻，都必须发动技术人员和职员动脑动手，并经过工人讨论修正后贯彻执行。因此，每个关键问题，每个工作阶段，都要密切注意职工的思想，注意树立职工群众中的先进榜样，进行先进思想的教育，特别要注意加强“国家计划就是法律”的教育，加强劳动纪律的教育，批判各种落后思想，巩固和提高出勤率，以保证作业计划的贯彻。对于技术人员和职员，要鼓舞其强烈的事业心，表扬其中的先进典型，批评其脱离实际、脱离工人和遇事互相推诿互不负责的态度。
    在加强计划管理的基础上，要发动职工开展劳动竞赛。各企业要深入检查总结上半年执行国家计划的经验教训，讨论下半年的奋斗指标，规定具体措施，发动群众开展劳动竞赛，学习和推广先进经验，加强劳动纪律，保证全面地均衡地提前完成国家计划，为国家第一个五年建设计划提前完成打下良好的基础。
