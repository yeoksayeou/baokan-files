    Zhucheng Zhucun Township Branch Corrected the
    Impetuous and Rash Deviation in Mutual Aid and Cooperation
    By the Chinese Communist Party Zhucheng County Committee of Shandong Province

    Editor's Note: The Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee held an expanded cadre meeting in early June to summarize the spring work. At that time, there were more than 20 typical reports, proving that implementing the ideological style of connecting with reality and the masses is an important key to doing all work well. We have selected several of these typical reports to be published here successively starting today.

    The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Zhucun Township has a history of eight years. It has completed the production tasks of various periods, increased grain production, supported the war, and improved the lives of farmers, thus generating a good influence among the broad masses. However, in the rectification and improvement of mutual aid and cooperative organizations last winter, it violated the principle of actively and steadily developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, resulting in an impetuous and rash deviation. This was mainly manifested in blindly pursuing advanced organizational forms, forcing activists to take the lead, and organizing large-scale mutual aid groups and large-scale agricultural production cooperatives. In five days, the township forcibly merged 69 small mutual aid groups into 37 mutual aid groups and newly organized two agricultural production cooperatives. In the merged large groups and cooperatives, livestock were forcibly put into the same trough, grain was turned over to the cooperative, and agricultural tools were collectivized; some excessively accumulated public property, purchased a large number of agricultural tools, and had excessive expenditures. Taking the Wang Huanchang mutual aid group as an example, the expenses for building cattle sheds, buying plows, lending agricultural machinery, and hiring feeders alone amounted to more than 17 million yuan, with each mu bearing 73,000 yuan, accounting for 34 percent of the total income per mu. This practice seriously undermined the Party's policies, dampened farmers' enthusiasm for production, damaged production, and became detached from the masses. Farmer Yang Xiyu felt that he had "joined a big pile" after joining the cooperative. Last year, he planned to plant five mu of peas, and the manure had been delivered to the field, but they were not planted. There used to be five households in Majiazhuangzi who regularly collected manure, but only one household remains this spring. Some farmers sold or hid their livestock in the homes of relatives and friends because they were unwilling to put their livestock in the same trough. A total of 31 heads of livestock were reduced in the township last winter and this spring. Many farmers felt that "life has reached its limit," and their production enthusiasm was low.

    The reason why the above deviations occurred and developed is first and foremost due to the fact that leading cadres at the county and district levels did not study the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies well, did not deeply understand the principle of actively and steadily developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and did not have a sufficient understanding of the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, thus violating the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Secondly, after eight years of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the trial operation of four agricultural production cooperatives last year, the superiority of being organized was demonstrated (for example, the average yield of production cooperatives was 30 percent higher than that of mutual aid groups, and the average yield of mutual aid groups was 15 percent higher than that of individual farmers); as a result, some cadres and activists developed an impetuous and rash mood, attempting to "reach the sky in one step," liking to do big things and disliking small things, and discriminating against and attacking individual farmers. They said, "Three or five households don't count as a group," "It is glorious to join the cooperative," "It is ordinary to join the group," and said many things to satirize and scold individual farmers. They universally felt that "mutual aid groups are not satisfying" and advocated "establishing cooperatives quickly to use tractors and realize socialism as soon as possible." The county and district leaders had the mentality of being fond of greatness and eager for success, and allowed these cadres and activists to forcibly organize large groups and cooperatives. The Zhujiacun Production Cooperative expanded by more than 80 households in one night. Thirdly, through a series of Party rectification education, mutual aid and cooperation training, and the propaganda of members of the farmer delegation to the Soviet Union, the broad masses of farmers received a profound education on the direction of social development and greatly improved their political consciousness; however, in carrying out this propaganda and education, because it did not proceed from the local actual situation, and simply and simplistically publicized "the happy life of the Soviet people and the easy and pleasant labor of collective farms," "Individual farming is not as good as mutual aid, and mutual aid is not as good as cooperation," and some even said, "This Party rectification will create an agricultural collectivization," which created a misconception among activists and some of the masses, who discussed "Our township will surely become a collective farm in 1954," "Take off your shoes and work harder to catch up with the Soviet Union." All this fueled the development of impetuous and rash deviations.

    In order to correct the impetuous and rash deviation in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Zhucun Township Branch of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the higher party committee, convened meetings of party members, members of the Communist Youth League and mutual aid group leaders in the spring of this year, and earnestly studied the "Decision on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" of the Party Central Committee. It focused on studying the two kinds of production enthusiasm in the countryside after the land reform, as well as the Party's principle of actively and steadily developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. After discussions, it was found that cadres and activists had many ideological concerns about correcting the impetuous and rash deviations in mutual aid and cooperation. Among some responsible cadres, the main concern was "fear of being punished," because these cadres felt that it was serious to make such mistakes in the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and discipline, and thus shirked responsibility and concealed facts from each other. The comrades of the work team, such as the leader Zhang Maoquan, looked mournful and were so worried that they could not eat; Li Zhifen prepared to go to the organization department of the county party committee to apply for punishment. Fanjiazhuangzi clearly merged twelve mutual aid groups into large groups, but only dared to admit three. These cadres were generally uneasy. Among general cadres, the main concern was "fear of losing face and looking bad." For example, the Wang Fangchi mutual aid group was originally very good, but after being merged into a large group, there was a phenomenon of disintegration. Wang Jianquan, a cadre working in this group, said: "No matter what, don't let it collapse, it would be too embarrassing, how can I eat this bowl of rice again." The Wang Huanchang group has long been known as the "advanced group" and "model group" and has been praised at every meeting. Now it has also been found that some members did not participate voluntarily. Wang Huanchang himself was therefore in low spirits and said: "How can I face people in the future?" In addition, some cadres believed that "organization is better than no organization no matter what." They said: "Although we have committed coercion and commandism and caused dissatisfaction among the group members, we have prevented the road of capitalism."

    Based on the above ideological situation of the cadres, the Zhucun Township Branch, under the leadership of the county and district party committees, carried out the work of correcting deviations from the following aspects: First, it affirmed the achievements of mutual aid and cooperation work, and used living examples to publicize the benefits of being organized to improve farmers' awareness; then, on the basis of affirming the achievements, it exposed the existing problems in the current mutual aid and cooperation work, and used concrete examples to prove the harm of impetuous and rash deviations to production. At the same time, it explained to the cadres and activists that this error was mainly caused by the leadership; and specifically examined its own insufficient study of the Party's policies and the instructions of the higher authorities, and its failure to act in accordance with the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies. After the above series of propaganda and education work, the various ideological concerns of cadres and activists gradually disappeared, and they more clearly realized that: "Without mutual aid, there would be no good life today," "The path we are taking is correct, but we have taken too big a step and stumbled, it is good to get up and walk steadily." The party members felt more deeply the importance of studying the Party's instructions, and many comrades said: If we do not resolutely correct the impetuous and rash deviations, not only will the mutual aid groups collapse, but the masses will also rise up to oppose us. In this way, the work of correcting the impetuous and rash deviations gradually became a conscious action of the broad masses of cadres and activists.

    Before correcting the impetuous and rash deviations, the cadres studied, and the masses were also educated, and the township branch led the work of ranking the mutual aid groups. As a result of the ranking, the mutual aid groups in the township can be roughly divided into the following four categories:

    The first category of mutual aid groups were mostly organized by individual farmers who were afraid of being discriminated against, purely to compete for glory, or even to pretend to be progressive, or were organized or forced to be compiled by a few people. For example, party member Yang Xiujun organized eleven individual farmers to form a "formal group" in order to show his progress. Farmer Hu Shouli took the lead in "organizing" a large mutual aid group to repay the government for treating his serious illness free of charge. Middle peasant Yang Qiyu, fearing criticism for taking the road of a rich peasant, encouraged ten well-to-do middle peasants to organize, but in fact, they never worked together, and were called "brand groups selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's head" by the masses. There were a total of six groups of similar situations in the township.

    The second category of mutual aid groups were originally small-scale mutual aid groups organized according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and mutual aid production was very good, but in order to "reach socialism early," under the instigation of a few activists, the several small-scale mutual aid groups merged to form large-scale mutual aid groups without the consent of all the members. Among them, there was a lack of leadership backbone and no work experience, production was not good, and the members had many opinions. For example, the Wang Fangchi mutual aid group originally consisted of six households and had a history of eight years of mutual aid, but last winter, in order to engage in agricultural production cooperatives as soon as possible, it merged with two other mutual aid groups to form a large mutual aid group of eighteen households. After the merger, the livestock became thin, production was not good, members were absent from meetings, the group leader criticized the members for not obeying the leadership, and the members complained that the group leader should not have merged into a large group. There were a total of ten groups of similar situations in the township.

    The third category of mutual aid groups were originally voluntarily organized by the masses and had a leadership backbone, but due to excessive accumulation of public property, coupled with poor management and excessive expenditures, they caused dissatisfaction among the masses and tended to collapse. For example, the Wang Huanchang mutual aid group was originally a model mutual aid group. Since last winter and this spring, it has spent more than 10 million yuan on various basic construction and land investment, accounting for 34 percent of the total land income. The members were very dissatisfied and said: "If we do this for a few more years, we will have to sell the land." There were a total of eleven groups of similar situations in the township.

    The rest belonged to the fourth category of mutual aid groups, most of which were voluntarily joined, and only a few people asked to withdraw from the group because they were dissatisfied with individual issues. The leading cadres of this type of mutual aid group were relatively strong, and the management was also relatively appropriate. However, some specific problems have not yet been resolved, which also affects the consolidation and development of the mutual aid group. For example, if two households raise one cow together, and one of the households wants to withdraw from the group, the problem of how to take the cow out; and how to deal with the agricultural tools bought jointly within the group when individual households ask to withdraw from the group, have not been effectively resolved.

    After the mutual aid groups in the township were ranked and the situation was clarified, the Party branch immediately suggested convening a township people's representative conference. At the township people's representative conference, the work of mutual aid and cooperation was summarized, and the "Decision on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" of the Party Central Committee was publicized, and the impetuous and rash deviations in the work of mutual aid and cooperation were exposed and criticized. Then, in response to the above four situations, different treatment methods were stipulated after research: for the first category of mutual aid groups, persuasion and explanation were carried out to change or abolish the original organizational form, and everyone was called upon to organize voluntarily; for the second category of mutual aid groups, patient mobilization was carried out to divide the large groups into small groups; for the third category of mutual aid groups, active leadership was carried out to improve and improve the management methods of the groups so that they could persevere; for the fourth category of mutual aid groups, the principle of unity and education was adopted, democratic consultation was used to solve specific problems, and consolidation and improvement were carried out.

    After the Zhucun Township People's Representative Conference was held, after about a month, the impetuous and rash deviations in the township have been basically corrected, and the management of the mutual aid groups has also been greatly improved. The number of organized peasant households in the township still accounts for 86 percent of the total number of peasant households, of which 14 groups with more than 10 households can still persevere and consolidate, 13 groups have been divided into small groups from large groups, 9 groups have been dissolved or reorganized voluntarily after persuasion, and 10 groups have remained unchanged. After the rectification, the various concerns of the masses were eliminated, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. For example, the Wang Huanchang group improved its management methods, specifically solved the problems of excessive accumulation of public property and excessive expenditures, and established a democratic management system to make it persevere. For example, the Wang Fangchi mutual aid group was too large and the leadership was weak, so it was divided into three groups, and each revised its production plan, launched a production increase competition, and completed the spring plowing and sowing work in a timely manner. The masses in Zhucun Township universally reflected that: "It is really following the right path, and there is hope for production."

    In the process of correcting the impetuous and rash deviations, the leadership style of the cadres has also undergone great changes. For example, after rectifying the mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the party branch members specifically divided the work and led eleven mutual aid groups to set an example, and then, based on the mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and with party members, members of the Communist Youth League and labor models as the backbone, launched a patriotic production increase competition movement from point to surface, and drove 26 individual farmers to formulate production increase plans, participate in the production increase competition, and promote the spring plowing and sowing work.

    In the patriotic production increase movement, the branch paid attention to the promotion of advanced production experience and tapped production potential. For example, changing "three crops in two years" to "two crops in one year" is expected to increase grain production by an average of 110 jin per mu, and the township can increase grain production by more than 220,000 jin. The "intercropping method" of corn, sweet potatoes (potatoes) and mung beans was promoted, and it is expected to increase grain production by an average of 15 jin per mu, and the township can increase grain production by more than 40,000 jin. The seedling protection experience of Guandi Village in Junan County was promoted, and it is expected to increase grain production by an average of 28 jin per mu for various crops, and the township can increase grain production by more than 112,000 jin. This pays attention to changing the generalized leadership style and gradually eliminates the farmers' ideas of "production has reached its limit" and "relying on the sky for food." At present, the township is carrying out a mass movement to tap the secrets of increasing production and exchange the experience of increasing production among the masses, so as to deepen the patriotic production increase movement.

    诸城朱村乡支部怎样纠正
    互助合作中的急躁冒进偏向
    中共山东诸城县委员会
    编者按：中共中央山东分局在六月初召开扩大干部会议，总结春季工作。当时有二十几个典型报告，证明贯彻联系实际联系群众的思想作风是作好一切工作的重要关键。我们从这些典型报告中选了几篇，从今天起陆续发表在这里。
    朱村乡的互助合作运动已有八年的历史。它完成了各个时期的生产任务，增产了粮食，支援了战争，改善了农民的生活，从而在广大群众中产生了良好的影响。但是在去冬整顿和提高互助合作组织中，违反了积极而又稳步地开展互助合作运动的方针和自愿、互利的原则，产生了急躁冒进偏向。这主要表现在盲目地追求高级的组织形式，强迫积极分子带头，组织大型互助组和大型生产合作社。全乡在五天的时间里，将六十九个小互助组强迫合并为三十七个互助组并新组织两个农业生产合作社。在合并起来的大组大社中，强迫将牲口合槽，粮食归社，农具归公；也有的过多地积累公共财产，大量地添购农具，经费开支过大。以王焕昌互助组为例，仅用在盖牛棚、买步犁、贷农械、雇用饲养员等方面的费用就有一千七百余万元，每亩需负担七万三千元，占到每亩总收入的百分之三十四。这种作法，严重地破坏了党的政策，打击了农民的生产积极性，破坏了生产，脱离了群众。农民杨喜玉入社后便认为是“合了大堆”，去年他计划种的五亩豌豆，粪已送到地里，但未种上。马家庄子常年拾粪的有五户，今春以来只剩下一户。有些农民因为不愿意将牲口合槽，就把牲口卖掉或藏在亲友家里，去冬今春全乡共减少了牲口三十一头。有很多农民认为
    “日子到顶了”，生产情绪低落。
    上述偏向所以发生和发展，首先是而且主要是由于县区领导干部对党的互助合作政策没有很好学习，对积极而又稳步地开展互助合作运动的方针体会不深，对小农经济的特点认识不足，因而违反了自愿、互利的原则。其次，由于八年来互助合作运动及去年试办了四处农业生产合作社之后，显示了组织起来的优越性（例如生产合作社比互助组平均增产三成，互助组比单干户平均增产一成五）；部分干部和积极分子因此产生了急躁冒进情绪，企图“一步登天”，喜欢搞大的，不喜欢搞小的，歧视打击单干农民。他们说“三五户不算组”，“入社光荣”，“入组平常”并说很多话来讽刺谩骂单干户。他们普遍感觉到“互助组不过瘾”，主张“快办社，好使拖拉机，早日实行社会主义”。而县、区领导上则存在着好大喜功的思想，听任这些干部及积极分子强迫组织大组大社。朱家村生产合作社在一个晚上就扩大了八十多户。再次，经过一系列的整党教育、互助合作训练和农民访苏代表团团员的宣传，广大农民受到了一次深刻的社会发展方向的教育，政治觉悟大大提高；但在进行这些宣传教育中，由于没有从当地实际情况出发，片面地简单地宣传“苏联人民的幸福生活，集体农庄轻松愉快的劳动”，
    “单干不如互助，互助不如合作”，甚至有的还说
    “这次整党就要整出一个农业生产合作化来”，这就在积极分子和一部分群众中造成了错觉，纷纷议论“一九五四年咱乡保险成了集体农庄”，“脱了鞋加劲赶，跟上苏联”。这都助长了急躁冒进偏向的发展。
    为了纠正互助合作运动中的急躁冒进偏向，中共朱村乡支部委员会，在上级党委的领导下，于今年春季先后召集党员、青年团员和互助组长开会，认真学习了党中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”。着重研究了土地改革以后农村的两种生产积极性，以及党在合作互助运动中的积极而又稳步地开展互助合作运动的方针和自愿、互利的原则。经过座谈，发现干部和积极分子对纠正互助合作中的急躁冒进偏向存在着不少思想顾虑。在一部分负责干部中，主要是“怕受处分”，因为这些干部感到在反官僚主义，反命令主义，反违法乱纪斗争中，发生这样的错误是严重的，因而互相推托责任，隐瞒事实。工作组的同志如组长张茂全哭丧着脸，愁的饭都吃不下去；李志芬准备到县委组织部去申请处分。范家庄子明明有十二个互助组合并了大组，但只敢承认三个。这些干部普遍不安。在一般干部中主要是“怕丢脸，不好看”。例如，王方池互助组本来很好，但在合并为大组后，就有散伙的现象。在这个组工作的干部王健全说：“无论如何别垮了，垮了多丢人，怎样再叫我吃这碗饭。”王焕昌组长期被人称为“前进组”、“样子组”，每次开会都受到表扬。现在也发现有组员不是自愿参加的。王焕昌本人情绪因此低落，他说：“往后叫我怎样见人？”另外，还有一部分干部认为“无论如何组织比不组织强”。他们说：“虽然犯了强迫命令，引起了组员的不满，但是防止了走资本主义的道路。”
    根据上述干部的思想情况，朱村乡支部在县委区委领导下，从以下几个方面进行了纠正偏向的工作：首先肯定了互助合作的工作成绩，并用活人活事来宣传组织起来的好处，以提高农民的觉悟；然后在肯定成绩的基础上，揭发当前互助合作工作中存在的问题，用具体事例证明急躁冒进偏向对生产的危害性。同时向干部、积极分子说明，这一错误主要是由领导造成的；并具体检查了本身对党的政策和上级指示学习不够，没有遵照党中央的方针政策办事。经过上述一系列的宣传教育工作，干部和积极分子的各种思想顾虑逐渐消除，比较明确地认识到：“没有互助就没有今天的好日子”，“咱走的路是对的，就是步子迈得太大，跌了跤，爬起来走稳就好了”。党员们更深切感觉到学习党的指示的重要，不少同志说：如不坚决纠正急躁冒进偏向，不仅互助组要垮台，而且群众也会要起来反对我们。这样，就使纠正急躁冒进偏向的工作，逐渐变成了广大干部和积极分子的自觉行动。
    在纠正急躁冒进偏向以前，干部经过学习，群众也受到了教育，乡支部就领导进行互助组的排队工作。排队的结果，全乡互助组大体可分为以下四种情况：
    第一类互助组，多是单干户怕受歧视，单纯为了争光荣，甚至个别是装进步而组织起来的，或是由少数人包办和强迫编成的。如党员杨秀军为了表示自己进步，便找了十一个单干户，组成了一个“形式组”。农民胡守理为了报答政府免费治好了他的重病，便带头“组织”了一个大型互助组。中农杨其玉害怕人批评自己走富农道路，便鼓动了十户富裕中农组织起来，实际上并没有在一起作过活，被群众叫做“挂羊头卖狗肉的牌子组”。类似这样情况的，全乡共有六个组。
    第二类互助组，原来是根据自愿、互利原则组织起来的小型互助组，互助生产很好，但为了“早到社会主义”，在少数积极分子的鼓动下，未经全体组员的同意，便把几个小型互助组合并成立大型互助组。其中既缺乏领导骨干，又没有工作经验，生产不好，组员意见很多。如王方池互助组，原由六户组成，已有八年的互助历史，但去冬为了早搞农业生产合作社，便和另外两个互助组合并成立了一个十八户的大型互助组。合并后，牲口喂瘦了，生产不好了，开会时组员不到，组长批评组员不服从领导，组员埋怨组长不该合并大组。类似这样情况的，全乡共有十个组。
    第三类互助组，原是群众自愿组织起来的，也有了领导骨干，但因过多地积累了公共财产，加上经营管理不善，经费开支过大，引起群众的不满而趋向垮台。如王焕昌互助组，原是模范互助组，自去冬今春以来，在各种基本建设及土地投资上，共支出千余万元，占土地总收入的百分之三十四，组员很不满意地说：“再搞上几年就得卖地。”类似这样情况的，全乡共有十一个组。
    其余的属于第四类互助组，大都是自愿参加的，只有少数人因对个别问题不满，以至要求退组的。这类互助组的领导干部较强，经营管理也比较妥善。但还有些具体问题尚未得到解决，也影响到互助组的巩固和发展。如两户合养一牛，其中有一户要退组，牛如何带出的问题；组内伙买的农具，当个别户要求退组时如何处理的问题等，均未获得切实的解决办法。
    全乡互助组经过排队，摸清了情况，党支部即建议召开乡人民代表会议。在乡人民代表会议上，总结了互助合作工作，并宣传了党中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”，揭发、批判了互助合作工作中的急躁冒进偏向。然后针对以上四种情况，经过研究，分别规定了不同的处理方法：对第一类互助组进行说服解释，改变或撤消原有组织形式，号召大家自愿组织起来；对第二类互助组，耐心动员，将大组分为小组；对第三类互助组，积极领导，提高和改进组的经营管理方法，使其坚持下去；对第四类互助组，本着团结教育的方针，采用民主协商方式，解决具体问题，进行巩固和提高。
    朱村乡人民代表会议开过以后，经过一个月左右的时间，全乡急躁冒进偏向，已基本上得到纠正，互助组的经营管理也有了很大的改进。全乡组织起来的农户，还占总农户的百分之八十六，其中十户以上的大组仍能坚持巩固下来的共有十四个组，由大组分为小组的有十三个组，经过说服后解散或重新自愿编组的有九个组，保持原状未动的有十个组。经过整顿以后，群众的各种顾虑消除了，生产积极性大大提高。如王焕昌组，改进了经营管理办法，具体地解决了过多积累公共财产、开支过大等问题；并建立了民主管理制度，使之坚持下来。又如，王方池互助组因为太大，领导较弱，便分成三个组，并各自修订了生产计划，展开了增产竞赛，及时完成了春耕播种工作。朱村乡的群众普遍反映说：“真是顺了大路，生产有指望了。”
    在纠正急躁冒进偏向的过程中，干部的领导作风也有了很大的转变。比如在整顿互助合作组织后，党的支部委员便具体分工领导了十一个互助组，作出样子，然后以互助合作组织为基础，以党员、团员和劳动模范为骨干，由点到面地展开了爱国增产竞赛运动，并带动了二十六户单干农民订出了增产计划，参加了增产竞赛，推动了春耕播种工作。
    在爱国增产运动中，支部注意了对先进生产经验的推广，挖掘了生产潜力。比如，将“二年三作”改为“一年二季”，平均每亩预计可增产粮食一百一十斤，全乡可增产粮食二十二万余斤。推行了苞米、地蛋（马铃薯）和绿豆的“间作法”，平均每亩预计可增产粮食十五斤，全乡可增产粮食四万余斤。推广了莒南县官地村的保苗经验，各种作物平均每亩预计可增产粮食二十八斤，全乡可增产粮食十一万二千斤。这样注意转变了一般化的领导作风，逐渐消除了农民的“生产到顶”和“靠天吃饭”的思想。目前，全乡正在开展群众性的挖掘增产窍门运动，交流群众中的增产经验，以使爱国增产运动深入一步。
