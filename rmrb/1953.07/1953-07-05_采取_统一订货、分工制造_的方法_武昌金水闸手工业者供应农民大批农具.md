    Adopting the Method of "Unified Ordering, Division of Labor and Manufacturing":
    Wuchang Jinshui Gate Handicraft Workers Supply Farmers with Large Quantities of Agricultural Tools
    After carrying out education on respecting teachers and cherishing apprentices, unity in production, and patriotism, and after clearly distinguishing the boundaries between teacher-apprentice and labor-capital relations, the handicraft workers of Wuchang Jinshui Gate have clearly recognized the role and future of handicrafts, dispelled the ideological concerns that "handicrafts have no future," improved teacher-apprentice and labor-capital relations, and increased enthusiasm for production.
    The idea of these handicraft workers serving the countryside and agricultural production was not yet clear (only two out of thirteen households made agricultural tools). In addition, they had lost the farmers' trust due to past shoddy workmanship and cutting corners, encountering many difficulties in the off-season. However, on the other hand, farmers urgently needed to purchase agricultural tools, and the market for handicraft products was very broad.
    Based on this situation, the leadership timely put forward the slogan that handicrafts should "face the countryside, guarantee quality, establish credit, and tide over the off-season," and educated the handicraft workers to actively establish contact with farmers. Through the Handicraft Industry Federation, they carried out publicity in the surrounding villages, promising "guaranteed quality, durability, fair prices, and return or exchange." At this time, farmers in various villages were preparing for spring plowing and needed to purchase agricultural tools. Upon hearing the news, they came to Jinshui Gate to order agricultural tools. Some villages jointly purchased large quantities of agricultural tools. Heping Township ordered 250 large agricultural tools (plows, harrows, cultivators, etc.) at one time, worth 12 million yuan. The Jinshui Gate handicraft market immediately became active.
    However, if this large batch of orders were undertaken separately by each household, it would not only be difficult to purchase raw materials, but it would also take ten months to complete. After consultation, the handicraft workers voluntarily adopted the method of temporary joint ventures, division of labor and manufacturing, and collectively signing contracts with rural areas to complete these orders. When signing contracts, the township government负责人 and the handicraft workers collectively discussed the style, quality, specifications, quantity, and delivery date, and calculated the price and profit based on the cost. The calculation showed that the selling price was lower than usual. After the contract was signed, the township government paid 80% of the deposit in advance, and the handicraft workers used the deposit to jointly purchase materials in Hankou.
    After the contract was signed, the handicraft households adopted the method of mutual care and full consultation to allocate the number of items to be manufactured by each household. They respected and took into account the opinions of those handicraft workers who specialized in making agricultural tools and had a good reputation, allowing them to report the number of items they would manufacture themselves, and then allocated the remaining items to be manufactured according to the labor force of each household. In order to ensure quality, the Handicraft Industry Federation held special meetings to inspect, criticize, and self-criticize, and urged improvements when shoddy workmanship was discovered. Before delivery, the finished products were also concentrated, inspected by the Handicraft Industry Federation, and then handed over to the township government for acceptance. The manufacturer's signboard was written on the finished product, guaranteeing return or exchange.
    Due to facing the countryside, actively serving agricultural production, and adopting an organized method of establishing ordering relationships with rural areas, jointly purchasing raw materials, dividing labor and manufacturing, and unified delivery, the business of the Jinshui Gate handicraft workers increased and sales channels were opened. For example, the business volume of the thirteen woodworking households in January, February, and March totaled 66 million yuan, an increase of 273% compared to the same period last year, and also more than double the business volume of April, May, and June last year. The phenomenon of uneven seasonal activity has also begun to be overcome. Handicraft workers have improved their skills, improved product quality, reduced costs, and met the requirements of farmers, and the farmers are very happy. Farmers have said: "It's really good now, the agricultural tools made are both good and responsible." (Liu Qichang)

    采取“统一订货、分工制造”的方法
    武昌金水闸手工业者供应农民大批农具
    武昌金水闸手工业者，经过尊师爱徒，团结生产和爱国主义教育，分清师徒、劳资关系界限后，明确地认识了手工业的作用及前途，解除了“手工业没搞头”的思想顾虑，师徒、劳资关系改善，生产积极性提高。
    这些手工业者的面向农村、为农业生产服务的思想还不明确（十三户中仅有二户做农具），加以过去粗制滥造，偷工减料，丧失了农民的信仰，在淡季遇到很多困难；但另一方面，农民又迫切需要添购农具，手工业产品的市场又是很宽阔的。
    领导方面根据这种情况，及时提出了手工业要“面向农村、保证质量、树立信用、渡过淡季”的口号，并教育手工业者主动和农民建立联系，通过手工业联合会到四乡进行“保证质量、经久耐用、价目公道、包调回换”的宣传。这时各乡农民正准备春耕生产，需要添购农具，听到消息后就纷纷来金水闸订制农具。有的乡合伙购制大批农具。和平乡一次订制大农具（犁耙耖等）二百五十件，价值一千二百万元。金水闸手工业市场马上活跃起来。
    但这大批订货如果由各户分别承做，不但购买原料困难，并且需要十个月才能完成。手工业者经协商后，自愿采取临时联合，分工制造，集体与农村订立合同的办法来完成这些订货。订立合同时，由乡政府负责人与手工业者集体商议样式、质量、规格、数目与交货日期，并根据成本来计算价格、利润。计算结果，售价较平常要低。合同订立以后，由乡政府预付百分之八十定款，手工业者即以定款至汉口联合购买材料。
    合同订立以后，手工业户即以互相照顾，充分协商的办法，分配各户制造数目，尊重并照顾农民直接找的那些专作农具信誉较好的手工业者的意见，由其自报制造数目，剩余的才按各户劳动力分配制造。为了保证质量，手工业联合会发现有粗制滥造情况时，就专门召开会议检查，开展批评与自我批评，督促改进。在交货前并将成品集中，由手工业联合会负责检查，再交乡政府验收，并在成品上写上制造户招牌，包调回换。
    金水闸手工业者由于面向农村，积极为农业生产服务，并采取了有组织的和农村建立订货关系，联购原料，分工制造，统一交货的方法，营业增加，销路打开了。如木业十三户一、二、三月份营业额共计六千六百万元，较去年同期超过百分之二百七十三，同时也超过去年四、五、六月营业额一倍以上。季节性闲忙不均的现象也开始克服了。手工业者提高了技术，改善了产品质量，降低了成本，满足了农民的要求，农民很高兴。农民纷纷反映：“现在真好，做的农具又好又负责。”（刘其昌）
