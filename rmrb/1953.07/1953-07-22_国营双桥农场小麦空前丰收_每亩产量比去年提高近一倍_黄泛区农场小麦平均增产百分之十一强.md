State-Run Shuangqiao Farm Achieves Unprecedented Wheat Harvest
	Per-Mu Yield Nearly Doubles Compared to Last Year
	Huangfan District Farm Wheat Average Yield Increases by More Than Eleven Percent

	This year, the state-run Shuangqiao Farm’s 280 mu of winter wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of 344.24 jin per mu (in-storage figures), nearly doubling the average yield of 180 jin per mu last year, and twice as high as the per-mu yield of nearby farmers.
	The state-run Shuangqiao Farm is a mechanized farm directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. The main reason for this year's unprecedented bumper harvest of winter wheat on the farm is the adoption of advanced Soviet experience throughout the entire cultivation process. Before sowing, the farm implemented land preparation work such as stubble removal and harrowing, and applied sufficient organic fertilizer to prepare good germination conditions for the wheat seeds. During sowing, all 280 mu of land used the Soviet method of dense planting, sowing the seeds very evenly, and rationally utilizing the land's fertility, which not only increased the number of plants but also increased the nutritional area of the seeds. This is of great benefit to the uniform growth, consistent maturity, and full grain of wheat. The wheat seeds are the "Yanda 1885" improved variety, which has high yield, strong disease resistance, and is suitable for local climate and soil conditions; selection, soaking, and dressing of the seeds has played a certain role in reducing bunt disease. In addition, the farm also adopted winter irrigation, early spring harrowing, and the application of fast-acting fertilizers as top dressing. The local area has little snow in winter, strong winds, and a lack of rain in early spring, so poor seedling emergence or uneven development easily occurs when the wheat seedlings turn green. Therefore, the farm irrigated the land once before the ground froze last winter; top dressing was also applied at the same time as harrowing in early spring. In this way, the wheat had sufficient air, moisture, and nutrients during the growing process, ensuring a bumper harvest.
	Advanced Soviet experience proves that a good harvest must be followed by a good storage. Poor harvesting techniques can cause wheat to lose 30% of its yield. China also has similar lessons in wheat harvesting. Before harvesting, the Shuangqiao Farm made a correct estimate of the harvesting period and carried out various preparations, so it was able to complete the wheat harvesting task in a timely and lossless manner.

	The wheat harvest at the state-run Huangfan District Farm has been completed. According to preliminary statistics, the average yield per mu is 175.8 jin, an increase of more than 11.83% over last year. The 5,474.2 mu of wheat planted by the farm's fourth work station yielded an average of 335.9 jin per mu; of which 930 mu yielded an average of 408.47 jin per mu, setting a national record for high-yield wheat production on a large area of dry land.
	The main reason for the higher wheat harvest this year at the state-run Huangfan District Farm compared to last year is the implementation of rational deep plowing and dense planting. Therefore, although the farm's wheat suffered continuous disasters such as water, frost, insects, frost, wind, and drought, it still obtained a better harvest than last year, which is very helpful in guiding farmers near the farm to adopt scientific cultivation methods.

### 国营双桥农场小麦空前丰收  每亩产量比去年提高近一倍  黄泛区农场小麦平均增产百分之十一强

    国营双桥农场小麦空前丰收
    每亩产量比去年提高近一倍
    黄泛区农场小麦平均增产百分之十一强
    国营双桥农场今年二百八十亩冬小麦空前丰收，平均每亩产麦三百四十四点二四斤（入仓数字），比去年每亩平均产量一百八十斤提高近一倍，比附近农民每亩产量高二倍。
    国营双桥农场是中央人民政府农业部直接领导的一个机械化农场。今年该农场冬小麦所以空前丰收，主要是在整个耕作过程中都采用了苏联的先进经验。播种前，该农场实行了灭茬、耙地等整地工作，施用足够的有机质肥料，为麦种准备了良好的发芽条件。播种时，二百八十亩地全部用苏联的密植方法，把种籽很均匀地播下，合理利用地力，不但增加了株数，而且加大了种籽的营养面积。这对小麦生长整齐、成熟一致、籽粒充实有很大好处。小麦种籽是产量高、抗病力较强、适于当地气候和土壤条件的“燕大一八八五号”良种；经过选种、浸种和药剂拌种，对于减少黑穗病起了一定作用。此外，该农场还采用了冬灌、早春耙地和施速效肥料做追肥的方法。当地冬季雪少、风大，早春缺雨，麦苗返青的时候容易发生缺苗或发育不齐的不良现象。因此，该农场在去冬上冻前地里灌了一次水；在早春耙地的同时又施了追肥。这样，小麦在生长过程中就有了足够的空气、水分和养料，保证了丰收。
    苏联的先进经验证明：丰产必须丰收，不良的收割技术可以使小麦损失百分之三十的产量。我国麦收中也有同样的教训。双桥农场在收麦前对于收割期作了正确的估计，并进行了各项准备工作，因此能够及时地无损地完成了麦收任务。（新华社）
    国营黄泛区农场小麦收割完毕。据初步统计：平均每亩收获一百七十五点八斤，比去年产量增多百分之十一点八三强。该场第四作业站所种的五千四百七十四点二亩小麦，平均每亩收获三百三十五点九斤；其中九百三十亩，平均每亩产量达四百零八点四七斤，创全国大面积旱田小麦丰产高额纪录。
    今年国营黄泛区农场的小麦收获量比去年为多，主要是由于实行了合理深耕密植。因此，该场小麦虽然连续遭受了水、冻、虫、霜、风、旱等灾，但仍然获得了比去年较好的收成，这对引导农场附近农民采用科学耕作方法很有帮助。（据新华社讯）
