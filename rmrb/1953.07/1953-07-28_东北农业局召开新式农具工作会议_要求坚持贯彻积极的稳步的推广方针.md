    The Northeast Administrative Committee's Agricultural Bureau convened a conference on new farm tools from June 27th to July 2nd. Participants included the heads and section chiefs of relevant farm tool promotion departments from various provinces in the Northeast, agricultural section chiefs from key counties for new farm tool promotion, and station chiefs from key technical guidance stations. Representatives from relevant departments such as local industry, banks, and supply and marketing cooperatives also attended the meeting. The meeting first reviewed the past work on promoting new farm tools and assessed the effectiveness of the over four thousand sets of new farm tools promoted in recent years. The assessment was as follows: nearly half of the new farm tools had relatively significant effects on increasing production; a considerable portion had less significant effects on increasing production; and a small portion of farm tools resulted in reduced crop yields because farmers had not mastered the usage techniques. Through specific analysis of the different effects of promoting new farm tools under different regional and conditional circumstances, the meeting affirmed the achievements of promoting new farm tools and their huge potential for improving productivity and increasing yields. The meeting believed that the main shortcomings in the past work of promoting new farm tools were: poor quality and inconsistent specifications of the farm tools, high costs, inadequate technical guidance, and an overestimation by the leadership of the purchasing power of farmers under the new circumstances of rural economic development after the land reform, as well as existing animal power conditions in rural areas. In the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, the meeting examined the root causes of these shortcomings. In addition to manufacturing defects, a lack of understanding on the part of the leadership about the promotion of new farm tools starting from the current state of the small-scale peasant economy, and subjectivism in the work, were the main reasons for these shortcomings.

    In response to the shortcomings in the past work, the meeting conducted repeated discussions and believed that the key to improving the work in the future lies in solving a fundamental problem and grasping three important links. One fundamental problem is: through rectifying farm tool factories, striving for specialization in farm tool manufacturing, and improving raw material supply work, to ensure the specifications and quality of new farm tools and reduce costs. The three important links are: first, to improve promotion methods, adopt the principles of adapting to local conditions and combining leasing and lending, in order to alleviate the burden on farmers borrowing new farm tools; second, to strengthen specific technical guidance, mainly by running technical guidance stations well, cultivating farmer technicians, so that farmers can accurately master the operation methods and farming techniques of new farm tools, implement continuous operations, and strengthen farm tool maintenance and repair work, to give full play to the production-increasing effectiveness of new farm tools; and third, to gradually solve the problem of insufficient animal power, in addition to generally renting or lending new farm tools to agricultural production cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams with stronger animal power, continuing to vigorously breed draught animals, improve animal breeds, and also selectively and gradually add some small tractors to technical guidance stations to supplement the lack of animal power for farmers during plowing and threshing.

    The meeting believed that it is necessary to adhere to the policy of actively and steadily promoting new farm tools in the future, further give play to the effectiveness of new farm tools, and improve agricultural productivity. The meeting required that all localities must further strengthen specific leadership over the promotion of new farm tools: first, all localities should further deepen their understanding of the specific circumstances of the promotion of new farm tools and propose realistic promotion plans; second, all county farms and demonstration farms must uniformly use new farm tools to set a good example for farmers; third, they should focus on going deep into the production process to conduct systematic comparisons and research, and find out the laws of using new farm tools; and fourth, they should rectify technical guidance stations so that they truly become the core organizations for guiding farmers to improve technology.

    The meeting emphasized that the tense wheat harvest is approaching. Currently, all localities must first do a good job in preparing for the wheat harvest, train farmer technicians in advance, and repair harvesters, plows, harrows, etc. During the wheat harvest, they must strengthen specific technical guidance, give full play to the effectiveness of new farm tools, improve the quality of wheat harvest operations, and do a good job in plowing and harrowing after the wheat harvest, to lay the foundation for increased production next year.

    东北农业局召开新式农具工作会议
    要求坚持贯彻积极的稳步的推广方针
    东北行政委员会农业局，在六月二十七日到七月二日，召开了新式农具工作会议。参加这次会议的有东北各省有关农具推广工作的处、科长，推广新式农具重点县农业科长及重点技术指导站站长等；地方工业、银行、供销合作等有关部门也派人参加了会议。会上首先研究了过去新式农具推广工作情况，对几年来推广的四千多套新式农具的效果，做了如下估计：有将近半数的新式农具，增产效果比较显著；有相当一部分增产效果尚不够显著；也有一小部分农具，因农民没有掌握使用技术而影响到农作物减产。经过具体分析在不同地区不同条件下推广新式农具的不同效果，肯定了推广新式农具的成绩及其对于提高生产力、增加产量的巨大可能性。会议认为过去推广新式农具工作中的主要缺点是：农具质量规格差、成本高，技术指导跟不上，领导上过高地估计了土地改革后农村经济发展新情况下的农民购买能力以及农村现有的畜力条件。会上以批评与自我批评的精神，检查了这些缺点产生的根源。除了制造方面的缺点之外，领导上对推广新式农具工作应从小农经济的现状出发认识不足，工作中存在主观主义，是产生这些缺点的主要原因。
    会议针对过去工作中的缺点，进行了反复讨论，认为今后改进工作的关键，在于解决一个根本问题，抓住三个重要环节。一个根本问题是：通过整顿农具工厂，农具制造力求专业化，改善原材料供应工作等措施，以保证新式农具的规格、质量、降低成本。三个重要环节是：一、改进推广办法，采取因地制宜、租贷结合的原则，以减轻农民借贷新式农具的负担；二、加强具体技术指导，主要是办好技术指导站，培养农民技术手，使农民能准确地掌握新式农具操作方法与耕作技术，实行连续作业，加强农具保养检修工作，发挥新式农具的增产效能；三、逐步解决畜力不足问题，除一般地将新式农具长期租给或贷给畜力较强的农业生产合作社和常年互助组，继续大力繁殖耕畜，改良畜种外，并有重点地逐步在技术指导站里添设一些小型拖拉机，以补助农民在翻地、打场期间的畜力不足。
    会议认为今后必须坚持贯彻积极的稳步的推广新式农具的方针，进一步发挥新式农具的效能，提高农业生产力。会议要求各地必须进一步加强对新式农具的推广工作的具体领导：第一，各地应进一步深入了解新式农具推广工作的具体情况，提出切合实际的推广计划；第二，所有县农场和示范农场，必须一律使用新式农具，给农民做好示范工作；第三，有重点地深入生产过程，进行系统的比较、研究，找出使用新式农具的规律；第四，整顿技术指导站，使它真正成为指导农民改进技术的核心组织。
    会议着重指出，紧张的麦收即将到来。当前各地首先要做好麦收准备工作，提前训练农民技术手，检修收割机、犁、耙等，麦收中更要加强具体技术指导，充分发挥新式农具效能，提高麦收作业质量，并做好麦收后的翻地、耙地工作，为明年增产打下基础。
