Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 22nd: A celebration was held by the Warsaw People's Council on the 21st to celebrate Poland's National Revival Day—the ninth anniversary of the Soviet army's liberation of Poland from the German aggressors. The celebration was attended by members of the Warsaw People's Council, representatives of various parties and social organizations, and advanced workers from industrial and construction projects. The entire venue erupted in enthusiastic applause when members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, members of the State Council, and government leaders appeared on the stage.

    Bo. Beirut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, delivered a report on the commemorative festival at the meeting. He first paid tribute on behalf of the Polish people to their liberators—the Soviet army and the Soviet people. He then spoke about Poland's achievements in all aspects over the past nine years. Beirut said that Poland now produces three and a half times more industrial products than it did in the era of bourgeois Poland. Compared with 1946, Poland's grain output has increased more than fourfold and is still increasing. The Polish people, drawing on the experience of the Soviet people and receiving their help, are victoriously implementing the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955) and victoriously building socialism. In the first three years of the Six-Year Plan, Polish industry has successfully completed, and even overfulfilled, its production plan. The value of industrial products is almost 13.5 percent higher than planned. In the first half of this year, industrial output exceeded the plan by another 3 percent. Currently, new factories are being built everywhere in Poland, or other enterprises that are of great significance to the life of a region and the country. Beirut then said that the Polish government will make greater efforts to improve the living standards of the working class, create better working conditions for the working people in urban and rural areas, improve their welfare, and raise their cultural level.

    Beirut then talked about international policy issues. He said that the Polish people have an unbreakable friendship with the Soviet people and the people of people's democracies. The Polish people, together with all forces for peace and progress, warmly support the Soviet Union's proposals aimed at easing international tensions and peacefully resolving outstanding international issues. Imperialists are suffering from the deepening of their internal contradictions and the development of peaceful forces. Therefore, it is no accident that the traitor and degenerate Beria was exposed at this time. Beirut said: The sinister imperialist conspiracy has suffered a fatal blow. After purging dissidents and hostile elements, the working class and its party have become more united. The strength and prestige of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lie in its unbreakable ties with the broad masses of working people. We will continue to develop our peaceful creative labor with confidence, calmness, and vigilance.

    Beirut's report was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

    华沙举行大会庆祝波兰国家复兴节
    贝鲁特报告九年来波兰在各方面的成就
    波兰人民热烈支持苏联旨在缓和国际紧张局势的建议
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社华沙二十二日讯：华沙人民议会在二十一日举行庆祝会，庆祝波兰国家复兴节——苏联军队从德国侵略者手中解放波兰第九周年。参加庆祝会的有华沙人民议会的议员，各党派和社会团体的代表，工业和建设工程的先进工人。当波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员、国务委员会委员和政府领袖们出现在主席台上时，全场热烈鼓掌。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席、波兰人民共和国部长会议主席波·贝鲁特在会上作了纪念节日的报告。他首先代表波兰人民向他们的解放者——苏联军队和苏联人民表示敬意。他接着谈到了九年来波兰在各方面所获得的成就。贝鲁特说，波兰现在所生产的工业品已达到了资产阶级波兰时代的三倍半。和一九四六年相比，波兰谷物产量已增加到了四倍多，而且还在继续增加。波兰人民吸取苏联人民的经验并得到他们的帮助，正在胜利地执行着六年计划（一九五○—一九五五年），胜利地建设着社会主义。在六年计划的头三年中，波兰工业已经胜利地完成、甚至超额完成了生产计划。工业产品的价值差不多超过计划百分之十三点五。今年上半年，工业产量又超过计划百分之三。目前，波兰到处都在建设新的工厂，或其他对某一地区和全国的生活有重大意义的企业。贝鲁特接着说，波兰政府将以更大的努力来提高工人阶级的生活水平，为城乡劳动人民创造更好的工作条件，增进他们的福利并提高他们的文化水平。
    贝鲁特接着谈到了国际政策的问题。他说，波兰人民与苏联人民和人民民主国家人民有着牢不可破的友谊关系。波兰人民和一切和平与进步的力量一道，热烈地支持苏联的旨在缓和国际紧张局势及和平解决国际上悬而未决的问题的建议。帝国主义者正在为他们内部矛盾的加深与和平力量的发展而苦恼。因此，叛徒和蜕化分子贝利亚在这个时候被揭发，并不是偶然的。贝鲁特说：罪恶的帝国主义阴谋受到了致命的打击。清洗了异己分子和敌对分子后，工人阶级和它的党变得更加团结了。苏联共产党的力量和威望，就在于它和广大劳动人民间的牢不可破的联系。我们将满怀着信心，沉着和警惕地继续发展我们和平的创造性劳动。
    贝鲁特的报告一再为热烈的掌声所打断。
