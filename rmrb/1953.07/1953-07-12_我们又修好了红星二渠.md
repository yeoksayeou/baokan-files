We Repaired the Red Star Second Canal Again
Fumin

Wudao Valley is a canyon located at the southern foot of the Tianshan Mountains. Towering cliffs stand at the entrance of the valley, and snowmelt flows out of the mountain pass all year round, with roaring waves like a mountain torrent. In eastern Xinjiang, where rain is scarce year-round, this snowmelt is so precious! But unfortunately, once the snowmelt leaves the valley mouth, it is completely swallowed up by the "Gobi" after flowing for only a few miles. Seventy-five *hua li* below Wudao Valley is a vast and fertile grassland, but due to the lack of water, the grassland remains barren year after year.

Last year, one day, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang came to the mouth of Wudao Valley and set up tents on the rocky beach. They were going to build a 75-*li*-long modern canal here—the Red Star Second Canal. Such a long canal needs to be paved with stones piece by piece, using cement and substitute cement to seal the seams. Many permanent architectural projects also need to be built on the canal: highway bridges, intake gates, spillway weirs, control gates, sediment discharge gates, sedimentation basins, and so on. The construction of these projects requires more than 71,000 cubic meters of stone, more than 15,000 tons of substitute cement, more than 800 tons of cement, 315,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel to be excavated, totaling more than 415,000 man-days of labor. There were many difficulties. Sometimes, strong winds would blow down the tents. At the foot of the mountain, rainfall was frequent, but the earthwork excavation units more than ten kilometers away from the mountain pass had great difficulty in obtaining water. A basin of water was often used, settled, and then reused. In the mountain valleys that were thirty or forty meters deep, cars could not drive in. If all the raw materials—stones, cement, sand—were transported by manpower, how many people would be needed! However, the comrades had endless wisdom and could overcome all difficulties. Wan E and Jiang Kuizhong from the Production Section introduced the "high-line transport of substitute cement" method, and Pu Yonggui created the "wooden wire-tightening machine," which increased the speed of high-line cement transport from one bag every three minutes to one bag per minute, saving eighty laborers a day. Sand and stones could not be transported by high-line, so Jiang Kuizhong suggested laying wooden light rails and using wooden carriages to transport them. The experiment was successful, and efficiency was greatly increased.

The heroic motor vehicle unit, which hauled stone slabs to Wudao Valley, worked day and night on the canal line. Autumn was the rainy season. As soon as dawn broke, the driver comrades would start the engines of their ten-wheeled trucks and drive one by one to Wudao Valley. In order to prevent vehicle problems, the driver comrades came up with many solutions. For example, if the car bounced too much, the leaf spring shackle pin would become flattened over time. Fan Zhongcheng used the front wheel axle pin to install it in the leaf spring shackle pin frame. After repair, it worked the same as before.

In the cause of building the motherland, many inventors and creators have emerged. In completing various different tasks, the comrades created more than twenty different methods. On the achievement statistics table for patriotic competitions, there were only upward arrows, no downward arrows. Earthwork excavation increased from more than three cubic meters to sixteen cubic meters, stone paving increased from sixteen meters to sixty-seven meters, and sand excavation increased from half a cubic meter to forty cubic meters.

Last November, the Tianshan Mountains had turned into a snow mountain, and boundless Gobi was covered with white snow. If the canal head project could not be completed before the spring snowmelt flood season, it would not be able to start construction until after April this year. Not only would the entire Red Star Second Canal not be able to release water on schedule, but the already built projects would also be in danger of being completely washed away. Therefore, the Party Committee of the unit decided: winter construction must be carried out to strive for timely water release.

Soon, a warm shed, one hundred and twenty meters long, eighteen meters wide, and six meters high, was built close to the cliff, covering the entire canal head construction area. Thus, tense work unfolded in this vast warm shed.

Soldier Peng Yuru wrote a fast-clapper rhyme poem to describe their labor:

“Wudao Valley, under the Tianshan Mountains,
Warm sheds are built in the depths of winter;
The warm shed is not simple,
The projects inside are really big;
Intake channel, drainage gate,
All are modernized.
Upon entering, you can't see clearly,
The buildings look like small hills;
There are carpenters and plasterers,
Also ironworkers and stonemasons,
Gas lamps shine brightly,
The stove burns red,
To build a new Xinjiang,
Everyone works hard.”

The soldiers in the warm shed, with their physical strength and wisdom, overcame the severe winter. The task required by the higher authorities to be completed by March 15th was completed on March 5th. On April 5th this year, the Red Star Second Canal officially opened its gates to release water. The surging snowmelt, spitting out waves, flowed along the canal towards the distance, flowing through the arid Gobi and flowing to the thirsty grassland. Here, on the 100,000 *mu* of land that has been barren for generations, a modern state-owned farm will emerge again. At this time, the comrades remembered when they repaired the Red Star First Canal last year and reported to Chairman Mao, who encouraged them in a letter:

"I hope everyone will always maintain the glorious tradition of our army and continue to work hard for the construction of the motherland." So the comrades all said: "Let us send the second good news to Beijing again, to Chairman Mao! Tell him that in order to benefit the people and maintain the glorious tradition, we will always advance in the great cause of building Xinjiang."

    我们又修好了红星二渠
    福民
    五道沟是天山南麓的一个峡谷，高耸的峭壁屹立在沟口，雪水终年从山口里奔流出来，波涛滚滚，有如山洪暴发。在常年缺乏雨水的东疆，这股雪水是多么宝贵啊！但可惜的是雪水一出沟口，流不到几里地，就被“戈壁”喝了个一干二净。五道沟下面七十五华里的地方，是一片肥美的一望无垠的草原，但是由于没有水，草原终年荒芜着。
    去年，有一天，人民解放军驻新疆某部来到了五道沟口，在乱石滩上搭起了帐篷。他们要在这里修一条七十五里长的现代化水渠——红星二渠。这么长的一条水渠，完全要用石头一块一块地铺起来，用水泥和代水泥糊上缝，渠上还要修建许多永久性的建筑工程：公路桥、进水闸、溢洪堰、节制闸、排沙闸、沉淤槽等等。修筑这些工程要用七万一千多公方石头，一万五千多吨代水泥，八百多吨水泥，挖沙石三十一万五千公方，总共需用四十一万五千多个人工。困难是很多的，有时大风刮来，常把帐篷吹倒。山脚下，雨水频繁，可是，离山口十几公里以下的挖土方部队，用水就非常困难了，一脸盆水，常常是用过后经过沉淀再用。在三、四十公尺深的山谷里，汽车是开不进去的，石头、水泥、沙子，所有的一切原料，如果用人力运输，要多少人哪！可是，同志们有着无穷的智慧，能战胜一切困难。生产科的万锷、姜魁忠介绍了用“高线运代水泥”法，蒲永贵又创造了“木制紧线机”，使高线运水泥由原来三分钟运一袋，提高到每分钟运
    一袋，一天可节省八十个劳动力。沙子、石头不能用高线运，姜魁忠便建议铺设木制轻便轨道，用木制车厢来运，试验成功，效率大增。
    往五道沟拉运石片的英雄汽车部队，日夜奔忙在水渠线上。秋天，正是雨季，东方刚发白，司机同志就摇响了十轮卡车的引擎，一辆一辆往五道沟驰去，为了使车辆不出毛病，司机同志想了很多办法，比如车子跳动的太大，日久弓子梁弹子烧扁了，范忠诚用前轮轴弹子装入弓子梁弹子的架子上，修好后使用和原来的一样。
    在建设祖国的事业中，出现了许多发明家、创造家。在完成各个不同的工作中，同志们共创造了各种各样的办法二十余种，在爱国竞赛的成绩统计表上，只有上升的标志，没有下降的箭头，挖土方由三方多提高到十六方，铺石由十六公尺提高到六十七公尺，挖沙子由半方提高到四十方。
    去年十一月，天山已变成一座雪山，皑皑的白雪，掩盖着无边的戈壁。如果渠首工程不能在今年春雪融化后的洪水期以前修好，就要到今年四月以后才能开工，不但整个红星二渠不能如期放水，就是已经修起的工程也有全被冲垮的危险。因此，该部党委决定：必须冬季施工，争取按期放水。
    很快在紧贴山崖的地方，搭起一座一百二十公尺长、十八公尺宽、六公尺高的暖棚，把全部渠首施工的地区都盖在里面，于是，就在这广阔的暖棚里展开了紧张的工作。
    战士彭育儒写了这样一首快板诗，来叙述他们劳动的情形：
    “五道沟，天山下，十冬腊月把暖棚搭；
    暖棚下面不简单，里面工程实在大；
    进水道，排水闸，那样都是现代化。
    一进门，看不清，建筑物好像小山岭；
    有木工和泥工，还有铁工和石工，
    汽灯照得耀眼明，炉火烧得一片红，
    为了建设新新疆，大家努力来劳动。”
    暖棚里的战士们，用自己的体力和智慧，战胜了严寒的深冬，上级要求三月十五日完工的任务，三月五日就完成了。今年四月五日红星二渠正式开闸放水，滚滚的雪水，吐出浪花，顺着渠道流向远方。流过干枯的戈壁，流到饥渴的草原。这里十万亩世代荒芜着的土地上，将又要出现一个现代化的国营农场。这时，同志们想起去年当他们修好了红星一渠报告了毛主席，毛主席来信对他们的鼓励：
    “希望大家永远保持我军光荣传统，为祖国建设事业继续努力。”于是同志们都说：“让我们把第二封喜信再寄到北京，寄给毛主席吧！告诉他老人家，为了造福人民，为了保持光荣传统，在建设新疆的伟大事业中，我们将永远前进。”
