    On the Front Lines of National Economic Construction

    Xinhua News Agency report: Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant Produces Steel Rails in Large Quantities
    Chongqing State-owned No. 101 Steel Plant is producing steel rails in large quantities to meet the needs of new railway construction projects and factory and mine construction across the country. Before last year, the plant supplied more than 100,000 tons of steel rails and accessories to newly built railways in various regions. After completing the supply of steel rails for the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, this year it is undertaking the task of supplying steel rails for the Tianquan-Chengdu Railway, which is under construction. In the second quarter of this year alone, the supply of steel rails to the Tianquan-Chengdu Railway and other regions exceeded 25,000 tons. Starting this year, the supply scope of the plant's steel rails has been further expanded, in addition to supplying the railway departments, it also supplies the needs of construction departments such as factories, mines and forestry industries in Central South, North China, Northwest and Northeast China. In the second quarter of this year alone, five units in Northeast China, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Hegang Mining Bureau, Fushun Mining Bureau, and Northeast Forestry Bureau, ordered more than 6,500 tons of steel rails from the No. 101 Steel Plant.

    Xinhua News Agency report: Factories in Dalian-Luda (Lushun-Dalian) Train Large Numbers of Technicians for Newly Built Factories in Other Regions
    Factories in Dalian-Luda (Lushun-Dalian) are training large numbers of skilled workers, technicians and management cadres for newly built factories in other regions.

    This year, the technical workers that factories in Dalian-Luda plan to train and transfer to other regions include 73 types of work, including machinery, chemical industry, textiles, and electricity. Among them, the number of lathe operators, fitters, riveters, and welders is the largest. Machinery No. 17 Factory alone will transfer 200 skilled lathe operators, fitters, and riveters each, and will specifically train 400 electric welders for Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Dalian Chemical Factory plans to train twice as many skilled workers as it currently has in the next two years. Jinzhou Textile Factory will train a complete set of cadres, from skilled workers and technicians to factory directors, this year. Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory is preparing skilled technical workers for the new railway lines in the Southwest and Northwest. In order to complete this glorious task, all factories have established specialized educational institutions to guide and organize workers' technical learning. The methods used by each factory to train technical workers are to hold technical training classes, organize technical research societies, and encourage master craftsmen and new workers to sign apprenticeship contracts.

    Xinhua News Agency: Planned Exploration of Gaseous Petroleum in the Sichuan Basin
    Planned exploration of gaseous petroleum is underway in the Sichuan Basin, and the drilling of the first oil well began in mid-June.

    Gaseous petroleum, generally known as natural gas, is abundant in the Sichuan Basin, with more than a dozen discovered mining areas. This gaseous petroleum can be used as fuel for internal combustion engines such as trains, automobiles, and ships, as well as for the power industry. Ziliujing in Sichuan has long used it for burning salt. The 303 Factory under the Southwest Petroleum Exploration Bureau has also used it to produce large quantities of carbon black for the rubber industry. Gaseous petroleum can also be used to make artificial fibers, artificial fertilizers, etc.

    The first oil well in the Sichuan Basin, which began construction in mid-June, has been in preparation for nearly two years, from initial survey to formal drilling. In September 1951, Soviet expert Mosiev personally went to the mining area for survey and determined that the mining area contained abundant gaseous petroleum. In 1952, the Southwest Petroleum Exploration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry sent people to the construction site to conduct detailed exploration and design in order to accurately calculate the reserves of the mining area. Subsequently, an engineering team was established to carry out preparatory work such as building roads, houses, pools, and level well sites, and hundreds of tons of new Soviet-style drilling machines, drill pipes, generators, etc., were transported to the construction site.

    Xinhua News Agency report: A Newly Built Automated Shoe Factory
    A newly built automated shoe factory near Xi'an has high production efficiency, averaging one pair of sturdy and beautiful new leather shoes every half minute.

    The factory was built according to the technical standards of advanced shoe factories in Czechoslovakia. The entire shoe-making process is automated and mechanized. In the preparation department of the factory, there are many highly efficient machines for cutting shoe soles and shoe uppers. Workers only need to place steel molds of different sizes on the whole piece of leather and press a button to cut out a perfect sole or upper shape. Among them, there is a large sole pressing machine that can press up to 3,500 pairs of soles per day. After the shoe soles and uppers are cut, they are immediately sent to the sewing department for processing, nailing shoe eyes, and making shoe palms, etc. Then, the various semi-finished products of the leather shoes are concentrated to the finishing department along various production lines. In the finishing department, there is a machine like a slender "marquee," called a transfer car. Hundreds of unfinished shoes are neatly arranged in the boxes on the transfer car. More than 20 kinds of machines are set up around the transfer car, and are operated by various specialized workers. The transfer car slowly rotates, and the workers process the shoes on the machines they manage. For example, the most laborious process in shoe making was originally nailing the heels, but here the workers only need to align the shoe heel and sole against the nail-driving machine, and the long iron nails spit out from the machine silently wedge into the sole. In this way, a pair of leather shoes is completely made after going through the above-mentioned 74 processes of the three major departments in half a minute.

    Xinhua News Agency: Lanzhou Industrial Testing Institute Extracts Rubber from Rubber Grass
    The Lanzhou Industrial Testing Institute of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Light Industry has achieved initial success in studying the method of extracting rubber from rubber grass. The testing institute has used the extracted rubber to make bicycle tires, rubber shoes, and machine belts, and the physical properties of these rubber products all meet the state's temporary standards. Recently, eight car tires have been manufactured, five of which have been handed over to the Beijing Public Transportation Company for trial use, with good results.

    The Lanzhou Industrial Testing Institute began to study the method of extracting rubber from rubber grass in the spring of 1951. At the beginning, small-scale experiments were conducted in the laboratory, and later it participated in the intermediate factory experiment of the Rubber Grass Research Group of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Light Industry. According to advanced Soviet experience, they used the grinding method and the solvent method to extract rubber, and obtained the above-mentioned results. In the future, they will continue to study how to improve quality and reduce costs, so as to apply the research results in the laboratory to industrial production.

    Xinhua News Agency: Suiyuan Province Horse Breeding Improvement Farm Achieves Success in Promoting Superior Soviet Horse Breeds
    The Suiyuan Province Animal Husbandry Bureau's Horse Breeding Improvement Farm has achieved great success in promoting superior Soviet horse breeds such as the Kabardin breed and the Soviet riding thoroughbred breed. From March 1951 to the end of May this year, the Suiyuan Province Horse Breeding Improvement Farm mated more than 7,800 horses. The superior foals born in 1952 are now running in groups on the grasslands of various counties and banners.

    Suiyuan is one of the main horse-producing areas in China, but in the past, due to the lack of attention to selecting breeds for horse breeding, and indiscriminate mating, the size and physical strength of the horses gradually became smaller, generation after generation, and the coat colors also became mottled.

    In order to improve the physique, physical strength, and coat color of horses, and to supply the needs of large-scale agricultural production throughout the country, the Central People's Government allocated 25 superior Soviet Kabardin and Soviet riding thoroughbred breeding horses each to the Suiyuan Province Animal Husbandry Bureau's Horse Breeding Improvement Farm in 1950. The farm began breeding experiments in the field in 1950, and set up five breeding stations in 1951 to mate mares for the vast number of farmers and herdsmen, which was welcomed by farmers and herdsmen. Currently, sixteen breeding stations have been added throughout the province, but they still cannot meet the needs of horse owners. Therefore, artificial insemination methods have also been promoted at various breeding stations. According to statistics for only the three months of March, April, and May this year, 3,320 mares have been mated, accounting for 78% of the annual horse mating task.

    四川盆地有计划地勘探气体石油
    四川盆地上正在有计划地勘探气体石油，第一个石油井的钻探工程已经在六月中旬开工。
    气体石油一般称为天然气，在四川盆地里有着丰富的蕴藏，已发现的矿区就有十多个。这种气体石油可以用作火车、汽车和轮船等内燃机以及电力工业用的燃料；四川的自流井在很早以前就曾把它用来烧盐；西南石油探勘处所属三零三厂，也已经把它用来大量制造橡胶工业用的碳黑。气体石油还可以用来制作人造纤维、人造肥料等。
    六月中旬开工的四川盆地上的第一个石油井，从初步勘测到正式钻探，将近作了两年的准备。一九五一年九月，苏联专家莫西也夫曾亲自到矿区进行勘测，确定在这个矿区里蕴藏着丰富的气体石油。一九五二年，中央燃料工业部西南石油探勘处为了精确计算矿区的储量，曾派人前往工地作详细的勘探设计，接着成立了工程队，进行了修筑公路、房舍、水池和平井场等准备工作，并把上百吨重的苏联新式钻探机、钻杆、发电机等运到了工地。

    一座新建的自动化制鞋厂
    西安市附近新建的一座自动化制鞋厂，生产效率很高，平均每半分钟就能制造出一双结实美观的新皮鞋。
    这座工厂是按照捷克斯洛伐克先进制鞋厂的技术标准建设的。全部制鞋过程都是自动化，机械化的。在该厂的准备部里，排列着许多效率很高的裁鞋底和裁鞋面的机器。工人们只要把不同尺码的钢模放在整张的皮上，用手按一下机钮，就可切成一片完美的底型或面型。其中有一架大型压底机，每天最多可压三千五百双鞋底。鞋底鞋面裁好以后，随即送到缝纫部去加工，钉鞋眼，做鞋掌等。然后，皮鞋的各种半成品就顺着各个生产路线集中到完成部去。在完成部有一台像一只瘦长的“跑马灯”样的机器，名叫转车。转车上的匣子里整齐的排列着几百双未完成的鞋子，围绕着转车设置有二十多种机器，由各种专门的工人操纵。转车徐徐转动，工人就在自己管理的机器上加工。如制鞋中原来最费力的一道工序是钉后跟，但是这里的工人只要把鞋后跟和鞋底对齐朝钉扒机上一靠，从机器里吐出来的长铁钉就无声地楔入鞋底。这样，一双皮鞋在半分钟内经过上述三大部的七十四道工序以后，就全部制成了。（据新华社讯）
    兰州工业试验所从橡胶草中提炼橡胶
    中央人民政府轻工业部兰州工业试验所研究从橡胶草中提炼橡胶的方法，已经初步成功。试验所用提炼出来的橡胶制成了自行车胎、胶鞋和机器轮带，这些胶制品的物理性能都合乎国家暂定的指标。最近又制造了八个汽车轮胎，其中有五个轮胎已交给北京市公共汽车公司试用，效果良好。
    兰州工业试验所在一九五一年春季着手研究从橡胶草中提炼橡胶的方法，开始时是在实验室里做小规模的试验，以后又参加中央人民政府轻工业部橡胶草研究小组作中间工厂试验。他们根据苏联先进经验，采用磨研法和溶剂法这两种方法来提炼橡胶，得到了上面所说的成绩。今后他们将继续研究提高质量和降低成本的问题，以便把实验所中的研究成果应用到工业生产中去。（新华社）
    绥远省种马改良场推广苏联优良马种获成绩
    绥远省畜牧局种马改良场，推广苏联卡巴金种和苏联骑乘纯血种等优良马种获很大成绩。绥远省种马改良场从一九五一年三月到今年五月底共交配马七千八百多匹，一九五二年生的优良马驹，现已成群的奔跑在各县旗的草原上。
    绥远是我国主要产马区域之一，但因过去对马的繁殖不注重选种，乱交乱配，使马的个子、体力逐渐变小，一代不如一代，毛色也慢慢花乱不一。
    中央人民政府为了改良马的体格、体力、毛色，供给全国大规模的农业生产需要，在一九五零年即拨给绥远省畜牧局种马改良场苏联卡巴金种和苏联骑乘纯血种优良种马各二十五匹。该场在一九五零年便开始在场内培育试验，一九五一年设配种站五处为广大农、牧民交配母马，受到农、牧民欢迎。现全省已增设了十六处配种站，但还不能满足马主要求，因此各配种站还推行了人工授精法，仅据今年三、四、五三个月统计，即已交配母马三千三百二十匹，占全年配马任务的百分之七十八。
