    Beijing held a meeting to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the National Revival Day of the People's Republic of Poland on July 22nd. The Foreign Cultural Liaison Bureau of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government held a celebration meeting in Beijing on the afternoon of the 21st. Those present included Zhang Bojun, Minister of Communications of the Central People's Government, Wu Xiuquan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wei Que, Deputy Minister of Education, Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of Culture, Tao Menghe, Deputy Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and heads of various people's organizations, as well as more than 800 representatives from all walks of life in the capital. Invited guests included Kiriloek, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Poland to China, diplomatic envoys and diplomats from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. In addition, Lieutenant General Bleich of Czechoslovakia and Major General Unglovsky of Poland, who were invited by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Central People's Government of China to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission for the Korean Armistice, were also invited to attend the celebration meeting.
    The celebration was presided over by Hong Shen, Director of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Bureau, and solemnly opened with the national anthems of Poland, China, and the Soviet Union. First, Minister Zhang Bojun delivered a report. In his report, he expressed warm congratulations to the Polish people on behalf of the Chinese people. He then talked about the brilliant achievements made by the Polish people in politics, economy, and culture in the nine years since liberation, and illustrated the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and Polish people with concrete facts. He said: The unity between the Chinese and Polish people is based on common interests and mutual trust, because both of our countries have grown and strengthened under the inspiration of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and under the guidance of the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin and the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction. The people of our two countries are fighting for a common great ideal—to build a beautiful and happy future for mankind. Therefore, the unity of the people of our two countries is permanent, unshakable, and increasingly developing. There is no doubt that continuing to strengthen the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Polish people is of great significance to the cause of world peace and democracy.
    Next, Kiriloek, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Poland to China, spoke. He pointed out that nine years ago, the glorious Soviet army brought independence and liberation to the Polish people. In describing the achievements of the Polish people, he said: In the past nine years, we have grown stronger and have been closely united with the people of other countries in the world peace camp, and have become an important link on the front of peace and democracy. Ambassador Kiriloek pointed out that the achievements of the Polish people should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman Beirut, the leader of the Polish people, the enthusiastic efforts of the Polish working class and the entire people, and the new type of international relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. This new type of relationship unites 800 million new life builders from the Baltic Sea to the Yellow Sea in unbreakable friendship to jointly strive for the cause of maintaining peace and building a new life.
    Their speeches frequently won warm applause from the attendees.
    After the meeting, artists from the capital performed famous Chinese and Polish songs, dances, and Peking opera and other cultural programs.

    北京开会庆祝波兰国家复兴节九周年
    【新华社二十一日讯】七月二十二日为波兰人民共和国国家复兴节九周年。我中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会对外文化联络事务局特于二十一日下午在北京举行庆祝会。到会的有我中央人民政府交通部部长章伯钧、外交部副部长伍修权、教育部副部长韦悫、文化部副部长刘芝明、中国科学院副院长陶孟和等和各人民团体负责人及首都各界人民代表八百多人。应邀到会的有波兰人民共和国驻中国大使基里洛克，苏联和各人民民主国家的外交使节、外交官等。此外，应朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和我国中央人民政府邀请、参加朝鲜停战中立国监察委员会工作的捷克斯洛伐克委员布莱希中将和波兰委员翁格洛夫斯基少将，也应邀参加了庆祝会。
    庆祝会由对外文化联络事务局局长洪深主持，在波兰、中国和苏联三国国歌声中隆重开幕，首先由章伯钧部长作报告。他在报告中代表中国人民向波兰人民表示热烈的祝贺。接着，他谈述了波兰人民在解放以来九年中在政治、经济、文化等方面所获得的辉煌的成就，并以具体事实说明了中波两国人民友好合作关系的发展。他说：中国和波兰两国人民的团结是建立在共同利益和互相信任的基础上的，因为我们两国都是在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的鼓舞下，在伟大的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说和苏联社会主义建设先进经验的指导下成长和壮大起来的。我们两国人民都是为了一个共同的伟大理想——建设人类美好的幸福的未来而斗争着的。因此，我们两国人民的团结是永久的，无可动摇的，而且是日益发展的。毫无疑问，继续加强中波两国人民的友好合作，对于世界和平民主事业，具有重大意义。
    接着，波兰人民共和国驻华大使基里洛克讲话。他指出：九年前，光荣的苏联军队给波兰人民带来了独立和解放。他在叙述波兰人民的成就时说：我们在九年中壮大了自己，并且和世界和平阵营其他各国人民紧密地团结在一起，已成和平民主战线上重要的一环。基里洛克大使指出：波兰人民的成就应归功于波兰统一工人党和波兰人民领袖贝鲁特主席的英明领导、波兰工人阶级和全体人民的热情努力、以及波兰与苏联、中华人民共和国及各人民民主国家之间的新型国际关系。这种新型关系把自波罗的海起至黄海的八亿新生活建设者团结在牢不可破的友谊之中，共同为维护和平与建设新生活的事业而奋斗。
    他们的讲话频频博得了到会者热烈的掌声。
    会后，由首都文艺工作者演出了中波两国著名歌曲、舞蹈和京剧等文艺节目。
