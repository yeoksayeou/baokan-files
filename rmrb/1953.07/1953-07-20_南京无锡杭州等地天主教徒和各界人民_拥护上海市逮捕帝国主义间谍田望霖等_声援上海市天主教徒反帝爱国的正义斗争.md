Catholics and people from all walks of life in Nanjing, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Qingdao, and Shenyang unanimously support the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's arrest of imperialist spies and secret agents Tian Wanglin, Zhai Guanghua, and Ge Shouping, and resolutely support the patriotic anti-imperialist just struggle of Catholics and people from all walks of life in Shanghai. After seeing the news of the cracking of these two imperialist spy cases in Shanghai, Catholics in Nanjing held symposiums on June 17th and 18th, and various districts also convened patriotic anti-imperialist conferences of people from all walks of life and Catholics. Every Catholic who spoke at the meeting expressed great anger at the imperialist elements using religion as a cover to carry out conspiracies to harm the Chinese people, believing that the cracking of these two spy cases had direct and significant meaning for guaranteeing the country's construction cause, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and supporting the patriotic movement of Catholics. They unanimously expressed that they would actively assist the People's Government in expelling all imperialist elements and their lackeys lurking in the Catholic Church. At the patriotic anti-imperialist conference held in the Fourth District of the city, Catholic Lu Wenbi said that he had dug up handguns, military telephones, and a large number of telecommunications equipment from the septic tank, ash heap, and corners of the wall of the Paul's Society on Matai Street in Nanjing. These were all evidence of the sabotage activities attempted by the expelled imperialist elements in religious disguise. Catholic Shi Zhefu said that he was a third-generation believer, and the spy case cracked in Shanghai had further deepened his understanding of the face of imperialism. He would resolutely stand with the vast number of patriotic Catholics and actively participate in the patriotic anti-imperialist movement. All Catholics in the First District, Second District, Fourth District, Ninth Middle School, Fourth Girls' Middle School, Infant Home, and Xiaguan and other places in the city issued written statements in the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, unanimously expressing their unparalleled hatred for imperialist elements in religious disguise and demanding that the People's Government severely punish this group of imperialist spies and secret agents.

Catholics and people from all walks of life in Wuxi, Xuzhou, and Changzhou and other places in Jiangsu Province have held symposiums in recent days on the cracking of the two spy cases in Shanghai. The Wuxi Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held an enlarged meeting on June 26th. The consultative committee members attending the meeting and representatives of religious circles such as Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Taoism all unanimously condemned the crimes of imperialism in using Catholicism to carry out conspiracies and resolutely supported the correct measures of the People's Government. Catholics in the city have successively established patriotic study committees at the city and district levels to specifically lead the patriotic anti-imperialist study of Catholics. On July 2nd, all Catholics in Wuxi City and Wuxi County also issued a letter to people from all walks of life, guaranteeing that they would earnestly study, raise awareness, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, distinguish between right and wrong, stand on the position of loving the country and loving the religion, unite with the vast number of people, contribute their greatest strength under the banner of patriotic anti-imperialism, and carry out an uncompromising struggle against all remaining imperialist elements. At a symposium held by Catholics in Xuzhou City, Catholic Zhou Ruixin exposed and criticized the imperialist elements hiding in the Catholic Church for repeatedly propagating absurd remarks such as Catholicism being "supra-political" to him. He pointed out that this was a conspiracy by imperialism to provoke and undermine the unity between Catholics and the vast number of people and the People's Government. The Patriotic Study Committee of Catholics in the city wrote a letter on behalf of the city's Catholics to the Shanghai Liberation Daily, expressing their firm support for the correct measures of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and their willingness to unite with the patriotic Catholic friends in Shanghai to continue to deepen the patriotic anti-imperialist struggle. At a symposium held by religious circles in Changzhou City on July 2nd, representatives of Catholicism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam who attended the meeting unanimously expressed that they would unite with people in religious circles throughout the city to support the patriotic anti-imperialist struggle of Catholics in Shanghai. Cheng Mingfeng and 67 other Catholics from Chengdong, Chengnan, and Chengxi towns in the city also wrote to the Shanghai Liberation Daily, expressing their determination to unite and completely eliminate the imperialist spies and secret agents lurking in the Catholic Church. On July 4th, Catholics from Changzhou City and Wujin County also formed a delegation to visit the "Exhibition of Criminal Evidence of Imperialism Using Catholicism to Carry out Conspiracy and Sabotage Activities" in Shanghai. Jiang Songmei, a Catholic who visited the exhibition, said: "Before I visited, my understanding was vague and I had concerns in my mind. This time, I saw with my own eyes the various crimes of Tian Wanglin, Lin Ren, and others using Catholicism to carry out conspiracy and sabotage activities, and the heinous crimes of harming Chinese children in the name of 'charitable organizations' under the guise of religion, and I saw the patriotic acts of Mr. Ma Xiangbo and others, the banner of loving the country and loving the religion in our church. Through this visit, my thinking has been greatly improved, and I have seen the true face of the imperialist elements." He expressed that after returning, he must convey it well to the church members and fight against these imperialist elements and their lackeys together with the church members. After watching the exhibition, Catholic Long Fang'e also criticized her past incorrect views. She said: "In the past, I thought that foreign priests were always very good when they came to preach, and they were here to help us Chinese do good things. After this visit, I realized that those imperialist elements were originally doing things that harmed the people. They were wearing the cloak of religion to carry out conspiracy and sabotage activities in China." Finally, she said: "I guarantee that after I go back, I will truthfully convey it to the church members, so that the church members will have a correct understanding, and we must be vigilant in our church and support the patriotic anti-imperialist struggle of people from all walks of life and patriotic Catholics in Shanghai." Catholics and people from all walks of life in other areas of Jiangsu Province, such as Shanghai County, Chuansha County, Chongming County, and Haimen County, also unanimously supported the Catholics in Shanghai.

Catholics in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, convened a patriotic anti-imperialist conference on June 17th and passed a declaration supporting the just actions of patriotic Catholics in Shanghai. The declaration pointed out: "We must not tolerate the evil deeds of imperialist elements and their lackeys using religion to carry out counter-revolutionary activities against our great motherland. We clearly realize that only by completely removing the imperialist elements and their lackeys from our church can our church not be controlled by imperialism and not be used by imperialism as a tool for invading our country. Only in this way can our patriotic activities and religious beliefs have true freedom. In order to defend our motherland and protect our freedom of religious belief, we demand that the People's Government severely punish this group of imperialist elements and their lackeys. All Catholics in Hangzhou have decided to support the patriotic anti-imperialist just actions of patriotic Catholic friends in Shanghai with practical actions of loving the country and loving the religion." Catholics in Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Lishui, and other places in Zhejiang Province have also held various large and small meetings in recent days to discuss the two imperialist spy cases cracked in Shanghai and studied the editorials and communications of the Shanghai Liberation Daily. Ningbo City also held an exhibition of criminal evidence of imperialism using Catholicism to carry out conspiracy and sabotage activities, thoroughly exposing the various crimes committed by imperialism in Ningbo area for a long time with various pictures and objects. At the various meetings held by Catholics in Wenzhou City, the heads of the sub-churches and prayer halls in various districts, the evangelistic affairs, and the elderly Catholics Shen Wuxi, Sun Zhewen, Xue Shunchen, Zhu Xi, Miao Xuezong, Tang Bochuan, Liu Jinming, Lin Hongxuan and others took the lead in participating, greatly improving the patriotic awareness of Catholics in Wenzhou City. Many Catholics said very firmly: We are patriotic Chinese people, and we are also good Catholics. We must support the just patriotic anti-imperialist struggle of the Catholics in Shanghai. In the past, we thought that after Wenzhou banned the reactionary "Legion of Mary" and drove away the imperialist spy Si Yifang, there would be peace in the Catholic Church; now we understand that this kind of paralyzing thought is harmful to the country and the church. People like Tian Wanglin and Dai Ande are not priests or bishops at all. They are seemingly upright on the surface, but they are despicable and shameless in essence, and they are all engaged in espionage activities. We must draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves with this group of imperialist spies and secret agents who undermine our country's security and undermine the purity of the church. In the discussion, everyone also pointed out: Because imperialist elements such as Tian Wanglin and Dai Ande not only carried out espionage activities, but also often used tricks such as "extracting divine power" and "excommunicating" to undermine or prevent the patriotic actions of Catholics, a few clergy and Catholics still lack understanding of the patriotic anti-imperialist struggle. Therefore, we must be more vigilant in the future, clearly understand the true face of imperialist elements, and work hard to study and improve our political awareness. At these symposiums, the Catholics also discussed the policies of the People's Government and unanimously believed that the People's Government's policy of "resolutely cracking down on the conspiracies of imperialism to use religion to carry out aggression, and legally guaranteeing the freedom of religious belief of the Chinese people" is very correct.

The Religious Affairs Group of the Qingdao Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Learning Committee of Religious Circles in Shenyang City held enlarged meetings on June 29th to discuss the two spy cases recently cracked by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government. Representatives of religious circles in the two cities unanimously supported the correct measures of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government in their speeches or declarations passed, demanding that the People's Government severely punish this group of imperialist elements who are enemies of the Chinese people and support the just struggle of Catholics in Shanghai. The Catholic representatives attending the meeting in Qingdao City also stated that they must strive to learn from the spirit of the patriotic Catholics in Shanghai, improve their thinking, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and carry out the patriotic anti-imperialist movement.

    南京无锡杭州等地天主教徒和各界人民
    拥护上海市逮捕帝国主义间谍田望霖等
    声援上海市天主教徒反帝爱国的正义斗争
    南京、无锡、杭州、青岛和沈阳等地的广大天主教徒和各界人民，一致拥护上海市人民政府逮捕田望霖、翟光华和格寿平等帝国主义间谍特务分子，坚决支持上海市天主教徒和各界人民反帝爱国的正义斗争。南京市的天主教徒在看到上海市破获这两起帝国主义间谍特务案的消息后，在六月十七和十八两日举行了座谈会，各区又分别召开了各界人民和天主教徒的反帝爱国大会。每一个在会上发言的天主教徒，对帝国主义分子以宗教为掩护、进行危害我国人民的阴谋活动表示了极大的愤怒，认为这两个间谍特务案的破获，对于保障国家建设事业、巩固人民民主专政、支持天主教徒的爱国运动都有直接的重大的意义。他们一致表示，今后将积极协助人民政府，把潜伏在天主教中的一切帝国主义分子及其走狗驱逐出去。在该市第四区举行的反帝爱国大会上，天主教徒陆文弼说，他曾在南京市马台街保禄会的化粪池、灰堆及墙角里挖出手枪、军用电话及大批电讯器材等，都是已被驱逐的披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子企图进行破坏活动的罪证。天主教徒施哲夫说，他是一个三代信教的教徒，从这次上海市破获的间谍案件中，已经使他更进一步认识了帝国主义的面目，今后要坚决和广大爱国教徒站在一起，积极参加反帝爱国运动。该市第一区、第二区、第四区以及第九中学、第四女中、婴儿院和下关等地的全体天主教徒，都在南京新华日报上发表书面声明，一致表示了对披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子的无比憎恨，要求人民政府严惩这一批帝国主义间谍特务分子。
    江苏省的无锡、徐州和常州等地的天主教徒和各界人民，连日就上海两起间谍特务案的破获举行了座谈会。无锡市各界人民代表会议协商委员会，在六月二十六日举行了扩大会议。出席会议的协商委员和天主教、基督教、伊斯兰教、佛教、道教等宗教界的代表人物，他们都一致愤怒地斥责帝国主义利用天主教进行阴谋活动的罪行，坚决拥护人民政府的正确措施。该市天主教徒已先后成立了市和区的爱国学习委员会，以便具体领导教徒的反帝爱国学习。七月二日无锡市和无锡县的全体天主教徒还发表了告各界人民书，保证他们要认真学习，提高认识，分清敌我，辨明是非，站在爱国爱教的立场上，和广大人民团结在一起，在反帝爱国的旗帜下，贡献出最大的力量，与一切残余的帝国主义分子进行毫不妥协的斗争。在徐州市天主教徒举行的座谈会上，天主教徒周瑞鑫揭发和批判了潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子曾一再向他宣传天主教是
    “超政治的”等荒谬言论。他指出这是帝国主义挑拨、破坏天主教徒与广大人民和人民政府之间团结的阴谋。该市天主教徒爱国学习委员会代表全市教徒写信给上海解放日报，表示坚决拥护上海市人民政府的正确措施，并愿和上海市的爱国天主教友团结一致，继续深入开展反帝爱国斗争。在常州市宗教界七月二日召开的座谈会上，到会的天主教、基督教、佛教、伊斯兰教的代表，都一致表示要团结全市宗教界人士，支持上海天主教徒的反帝爱国斗争。该市城东、城南、城西镇的天主教徒程鸣风等六十七人也写信给上海解放日报，表示决心团结一致，彻底清除潜伏在天主教内的帝国主义间谍特务分子。七月四日，常州市、武进县天主教徒还组成了代表团，到上海参观了“帝国主义利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动罪证展览会”。前往参观的教徒蒋松梅说：“当我未参观前，认识是模糊的，思想上有顾虑。这次参观我亲眼看到了田望霖、林仁等利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动各种罪行和披着宗教外衣以‘慈善机关’为名残害我们中国儿童的滔天罪行，看到我国教内的爱国爱教的旗帜马相伯先生等的爱国行为。通过这次参观使我思想上有了很大的提高，看清了帝国主义分子真正的面目。”他表示，回去后一定要向教友们很好的传达，和教友们一起，对这些帝国主义分子和其走狗进行斗争。教徒龙芳娥在看了展览会后，也批判了她过去不正确的看法。她说：“我过去认为外国神甫来传教总是很好的，他们是来帮助我们中国办好事的，在这次参观后，才认识到那些帝国主义分子原来是做的危害人民的事，他们是披着宗教的外衣到中国来进行阴谋破坏活动的。”最后她说：“我保证回去后要实事求是地向教徒们传达，使教徒们都有正确的认识，在我们的教内要提高警惕，支持上海市各界人民和爱国天主教徒的反帝爱国的斗争。”江苏省其他地区，如上海县、川沙县、崇明县、海门县等地的天主教徒和各界人民也一致声援上海市的天主教徒。
    浙江省杭州市的天主教徒在六月十七日召开了反帝爱国大会，通过了支持上海市爱国天主教徒正义行动的宣言。宣言指出：“我们决不能容忍帝国主义分子及其走狗利用宗教对我们伟大的祖国进行反革命活动的罪恶勾当。我们清楚地认识到只有将帝国主义分子及其走狗彻底从我们的教会内部清除出去，才能使我们的教会不被帝国主义所控制，不被帝国主义当作侵略我国的工具。也只有这样，我们的爱国活动与宗教信仰才有真正的自由。为了保卫我们的祖国，保护我们的宗教信仰自由，我们要求人民政府严惩这批帝国主义分子及其走狗。我们全杭州的天主教徒决定以爱国爱教的实际行动来支持上海市天主教爱国教友们的反帝爱国的正义行动。”浙江省的嘉兴、温州、丽水等地的天主教徒，也连日举行了各种大小会议，讨论上海市破获的两起帝国主义间谍特务案，并学习了上海解放日报的社论和通讯等。宁波市还举办了帝国主义利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动罪证展览会，用各种图片和实物彻底揭露了帝国主义长期在宁波地区进行侵略活动的种种罪行。在温州市天主教徒召开的各种会议上，各区天主堂分堂及祈祷所负责人、传教司事，老年教友沈梧西、孙哲文、薛舜臣、朱希、缪学仲、汤伯川、刘金铭、林洪宣等积极带头参加，大大地提高了温州市天主教徒的爱国觉悟。许多教徒都很坚决地说：我们是爱国的中国人民，我们又是善良的天主教徒，我们一定要声援上海教友正义的反帝爱国斗争。过去我们以为温州取缔了反动的“圣母军”，并赶走了帝国主义间谍分子司仪芳后，天主教内就太平无事了；现在明白了这种麻痹的思想对国家、对教会都有害处。像田望霖、戴安德这批人根本算不上什么神甫、主教，他们表面上道貌岸然，实质上卑鄙无耻，干的都是间谍特务勾当。我们必须和这批破坏我们祖国安全、破坏教会纯洁的帝国主义间谍特务分子划清敌我界限。在讨论中，大家还提出：由于像田望霖、戴安德等帝国主义分子不仅进行间谍特务活动，并且还时常用“摘神权”、“出通功”等伎俩来破坏或阻止教徒的爱国行动，所以有少数神职人员及教徒至今对反帝爱国斗争还认识不足。因此今后我们更须提高警惕，将帝国主义分子的真正面目认识清楚；并努力学习，提高政治觉悟。在这些座谈会上，教徒们并讨论了人民政府的政策，一致认为人民政府“对于帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略活动的阴谋，必须坚决的予以打击；而对于中国人民的宗教信仰自由则依法予以保障”的政策是十分正确的。
    山东省青岛市各界人民代表会议协商委员会宗教事务组，沈阳市宗教界学习委员会，都在六月二十九日召开了扩大会议，座谈上海市人民政府最近破获的两起间谍特务案。两市宗教界的代表在发言中或通过的宣言中，都一致拥护上海市人民政府的正确措施，要求人民政府严厉制裁这一批与中国人民为敌的帝国主义分子，支持上海市天主教徒的正义斗争。青岛市出席会议的天主教代表还表示，他们
    一定努力学习上海市爱国教徒的精神，提高自己的思想，分清敌我界限，开展反帝爱国运动。
