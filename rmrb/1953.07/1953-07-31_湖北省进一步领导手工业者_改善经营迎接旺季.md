    Hubei Province is Further Leading Handicraft Workers to
    Improve Operations and Greet the Peak Season
    Local leading organs in Hubei Province are further guiding handicraft workers to improve their operations in preparation for the peak season.

    After initial rectification, the quality and output of handicrafts in Hubei Province have improved, appropriately meeting the needs of national economic construction and farmers' production and life. A new phenomenon of "not slack in the off-season" has also appeared in some areas. According to incomplete statistics, more than 500 new handicraft workers and apprentices have been added to the province in the past six months. Some handicraft workshops in Echeng County have more than doubled their production. Due to the continuous improvement of product quality, many handicraft products are in short supply. In order to welcome the arrival of the peak season, local leading organs in Hubei Province are further strengthening their leadership in handicraft production and actively carrying out campaigns to increase output and improve quality. Chengguan Town, Echeng County, has held a special meeting to discuss and decided that, in addition to continuing to educate workers to improve the quantity and quality of products, it will also provide necessary assistance to handicraft workers in terms of funds and raw materials through the People's Bank of China and state-owned trading companies. Cadres in Xiantao Town, Mianyang County, went deep into the handicraft workers and masters, mobilized them to hold meetings and discussions, and helped them realize that it was wrong to produce shoddy goods and cut prices during the peak season in the past. Therefore, it was stipulated that bad goods could be returned or exchanged. In the past month, the output of handicraft products in the town has generally increased by 50% to 100%, and the quality has also improved accordingly. Ten iron shops in Chengguan Town, Huangpi County, recently adopted the method of joint procurement of raw materials, which greatly saved costs and manpower. Among them, Deng Jiaxing Iron Shop has also formulated a specific plan, stipulating the reduction of production costs, the improvement of product quantity and quality, the improvement of business style, and the protection of workers' health. Some handicraft workers are also planning to sign sales contracts with relevant cooperatives during the peak months.

    湖北省进一步领导手工业者
    改善经营迎接旺季
    湖北省各地领导机关正进一步领导手工业者改善经营，迎接旺季。
    湖北省各地手工业经过初步整顿后，产品质量和产量都有提高，适当地满足了国家经济建设和农民生产上和生活上的需要。部分地区并出现了淡季不淡的新气象。据不完全统计，半年来全省新增加手工业工人和学徒五百人以上。鄂城县有的手工作坊扩大生产一倍多。由于产品质量的不断提高，很多手工业产品已供不应求。为了迎接旺季的到来，湖北省各地领导机关正进一步加强对手工业生产的领导，积极开展增加产量、提高质量的运动。鄂城县城关镇已专门开会讨论，决定除继续教育工人提高产品数量和质量外，并通过人民银行、国营贸易公司，在资金和原料上给手工业者以必要的帮助。沔阳县仙桃镇干部深入手工业工人和师傅，发动他们开会讨论，帮助他们认识过去每到旺季就粗制滥造、互相杀价是不对的，从而规定了不好的货卖出包退包换。近一个月来，该镇手工业产品产量普遍提高了百分之五十至一百，质量也随之提高。黄陂县城关镇十家铁业最近采用联购原料办法，大大节省了费用和人力。其中邓家兴铁铺并订出具体计划，规定了降低生产成本，提高产品数量、质量，改善经营作风和保护工人身体健康。有的手工业者并计划通过旺月，和有关合作社订立购销合同。　（新华社）
