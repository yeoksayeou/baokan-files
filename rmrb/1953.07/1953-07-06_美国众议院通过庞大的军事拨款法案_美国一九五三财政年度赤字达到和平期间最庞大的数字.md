    Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Washington Dispatch: Despite the serious financial difficulties caused by frantic military spending in the US government's 1953 fiscal year, the US House of Representatives on July 2, based on the recommendation of the Appropriations Committee, passed a bill to allocate a large amount of funds to the US Department of Defense and the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the 1954 fiscal year, in order to continue its plan to expand armaments and prepare for war.
    The bill, unanimously passed by the House of Representatives, stipulates that $12.9822 billion be allocated to the US Army, $11.0048 billion to the US Air Force, and $9.3844 billion to the US Navy in the 1954 fiscal year, and an additional $1.0019 billion be allocated to the US Department of Defense for its disposal. The total of these four military appropriations amounts to a staggering $34.4333 billion.
    The military appropriation bill passed by the House of Representatives is currently submitted to the Senate for discussion.
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Washington Dispatch: The US Treasury Department's settlement statement for the 1953 fiscal year, announced on July 1, shows that the tax revenue extracted by the US federal government from the people, the total annual expenditure of the federal government, and the deficit in the 1953 fiscal year have all reached unprecedented peaks during peacetime.
    The total expenditure of the US federal government for the 1953 fiscal year announced by the US Treasury Department reached a staggering $74.6 billion, more than $8.5 billion more than the total expenditure for the entire 1952 fiscal year. Of the $74.6 billion in total expenditure, the cost of expanding armaments and preparing for war accounted for more than $46.6 billion, and the cost of so-called economic "aid" and military "aid" accounted for more than $6 billion. These two military expenditures totaled more than $52.6 billion, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total expenditure.
    The figures from the US Treasury Department also show that the total income for the 1953 fiscal year (most of which is various tax revenues) has increased from more than $62.1 billion in the 1952 fiscal year to more than $65.2 billion. Compared with the first year of the Korean War, this figure has actually increased by 35 percent, and compared with the highest total income during the Second World War in the 1945 fiscal year, it has increased by more than 45 percent. The burden of the US government's heavy tax policy mostly falls on the heads of ordinary American people. Today, about one-third of the income of an average worker in the United States is swallowed up by the direct and indirect taxes of the US government.
    Although the US government has used a wide variety of taxation methods to maintain its huge military spending, revenue and expenditure are still not balanced. The settlement for the 1953 fiscal year announced by the Treasury Department shows that the US government has accumulated a fiscal deficit of more than $9.38 billion, the largest during peacetime. This deficit is more than double the deficit in the 1952 fiscal year. The Treasury Department is preparing to borrow between $5.5 billion and $6 billion by issuing "tax anticipation warrants." This means that before taxes are even paid, the US government will preemptively impose the burden of financial hardship on the shoulders of the American people.

### 美国众议院通过庞大的军事拨款法案  美国一九五三财政年度赤字达到和平期间最庞大的数字

    美国众议院通过庞大的军事拨款法案
    美国一九五三财政年度赤字达到和平期间最庞大的数字
    【新华社五日讯】华盛顿消息，尽管美国政府在一九五三财政年度因疯狂的军费开支造成严重的财政困难，美国众议院七月二日还是根据拨款委员会的建议，通过在一九五四财政年度拨出大量款项给美国国防部与海陆空三军，以便继续推行扩军备战的计划。
    众议院一致通过的法案规定，在一九五四财政年度内拨款一百二十九亿八千二百万美元给美国陆军，一百一十亿零四千八百万美元给美国空军，九十三亿八千四百万美元给美国海军，另外拨款十亿零一千九百万美元给美国国防部支配。这四项军事拨款合计，总数高达三百四十四亿三千余万美元。
    众议院通过的军事拨款法案目前正提交参议院讨论。
    【新华社五日讯】华盛顿消息：美国财政部七月一日宣布的一九五三财政年度结算说明，美国联邦政府从人民身上勒取的税款、联邦政府全年的开支以及一九五三财政年度的赤字，都达到了和平时期空前未有的最高峰。
    美国财政部宣布的一九五三财政年度联邦政府的总支出数字高达七百四十六亿余美元，比一九五二财政年度全年的总支出多八十五亿余美元。在七百四十六亿余美元的总支出中，用在扩军备战方面的费用占四百六十六亿余美元，用在所谓经济“援助”和军事“援助”方面的费用占六十亿余美元。这两项军事性开支共达五百二十六亿多美元，占总支出的百分之七十以上。
    美国财政部的数字同时表明，一九五三财政年度的总收入（其中绝大部分是各种赋税收入），已经从一九五二财政年度的六百二十一亿余美元增至六百五十二亿余美元。这个数字如果与朝鲜战争第一年比较，实际增加了百分之三十五，与第二次世界大战期间总收入最高的一九四五财政年度比较，增加了百分之四十五以上。美国政府这种重税政策的负担，绝大部分都落在美国普通人民的头上。今日美国一个普通工人的收入，约有三分之一被美国政府的直接和间接税所吞没。
    尽管美国政府用了名目繁多的征税办法来维持其庞大的军事开支，但收支仍然无法平衡。财政部宣布的一九五三财政年度结算表明，美国政府已积下了九十三亿八千余万美元的在和平期间最庞大的财政赤字。这个赤字比一九五二财政年度的赤字多一倍以上。财政部为此已准备用“预缴税券”的方式借款五十五亿至六十亿美元。这就意味着在还没有纳税以前，美国政府就将把财政拮据的重担预先强加在美国人民的肩上。
