    Ceasefire at Triangle Hill
    After receiving the ceasefire order from Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai on July 27th, the command of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army guarding the Triangle Hill area north of Kimhwa on the Korean Central Front immediately notified all subordinate units by telephone to resolutely abide by the Armistice Agreement and to completely cease fire across the entire line at the effective time of the ceasefire, which was 10:00 PM on July 27th. Subsequently, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army interpreters also used broadcasting equipment on the forward positions to inform the enemy troops of the ceasefire time.
    Before the ceasefire, the Li Syngman troops frantically bombarded our forward positions with artillery shells and fired dense machine-gun fire. But they were quickly silenced by our army's fierce artillery fire. Before the ceasefire, four enemy bombers that flew over our army's positions to bomb and strafe were also shot down by our army's anti-aircraft fire, and the other enemy planes fled in panic. The downed enemy plane crashed near our army's position, and a raging fire broke out. Our army's anti-aircraft gunners, looking at the burning enemy plane, said: This is the ninety-fifth enemy plane we have shot down.
    At precisely 22:00 hours, our army first ceased all combat operations, and the battlefield, which was filled with the sound of artillery explosions and the whistle of bullets a moment ago, suddenly fell silent. In the pale moonlight, the downed enemy plane was still burning. An enemy tank that had been destroyed by our artillery in front of "Red Hill Top" before the ceasefire was still emitting white smoke.
    After the ceasefire, our army's positions were filled with the joy of victory. Our army's snipers on the position called "Sniper Ridge" came out of their shooting platforms with their merit books of killing the enemy and happily calculated the total number of enemies they had annihilated. Many heroic units that had gloriously made war contributions planted red award flags on the high ground of the positions, allowing the victorious red flags to flutter in the night sky. Soldiers who had made meritorious contributions wore their medals and honors, which they usually wrapped in silk, on their chests. The soldiers had already carefully studied the ceasefire orders of Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai. They guaranteed that they would resolutely abide by the Armistice Agreement, but if the enemy dared to come and invade, they would certainly beat them mercilessly! Sniper Zhou Shanghe wrote a letter to his mother, reporting his glorious deeds of killing and wounding seventy-five enemies in the twelve days before the ceasefire. Zhou Shanghe told his mother: The Korean and Chinese People's Armies have won the glorious victory of the Korean ceasefire, but he and his comrades will never relax and become complacent, and will certainly defend the victory with high vigilance.
    In our army's command post, which was lit by a gasoline lamp, commanders sat around a military map, discussing the great victory of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies fighting side by side to drive the enemy from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel. They poured wine that had just been shipped from the motherland into their glasses, and together they raised their glasses and shouted: "Cheers to the glorious victory of the Korean ceasefire!" "Strive for the full realization of the Korean Armistice Agreement!"
    After our army ceased all combat operations, the searchlight beams on the enemy's position also went out. The enemy soldiers were celebrating so wildly that it was as if they were celebrating Christmas Eve. They crawled out of their dark bunkers, greedily breathing the fresh air, and immediately lit countless bonfires and torches, illuminating their positions in red. At this time, an ambulance drove from the rear of the enemy's position to the enemy tank destroyed in front of our army's position, carrying away the American tank soldiers who had been burned to death. The Li Syngman troops opposite "Sniper Ridge" also dragged many corpses of their comrades from the air-raid shelters and loaded them onto two trucks to be transported to the rear. At a junction of an American and Li Syngman army position, many American soldiers and Li Syngman soldiers threw their rifles on the ground as soon as they crawled out of their bunkers, and then threw their helmets down the mountain. They were thankful that they had not become needless victims of the war of aggression.

    停火在上甘岭
    新华社记者  路云
    七月二十七日，守卫在朝鲜中线金化以北上甘岭地区的中国人民志愿军某部指挥机关在接到金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员的停战命令后，立刻用电话通知所属各部队全体人员坚决遵守停战协定，在停火生效时间，即七月二十七日下午十时起，全线完全停火。接着，前线我军通译员也在前沿阵地上用广播机向敌军通告停火时间。
    停火前的傍晚，李伪军还疯狂地向我军前沿阵地轰击着炮弹，发射着密集的机关枪火。但它们旋即被我军的猛烈炮火打得哑然无声。停火前，飞到我军阵地上空进行轰炸扫射的四架敌人的轰炸机，也被我军的高射炮火击落了一架，其他的敌机便慌忙飞逃了。被击落的这架敌机坠落在我军阵地附近，燃烧起熊熊大火。我军高射炮手们望着正在燃烧的敌机说：这是我们击落的第九十五架敌机了。
    二十二时正，我军首先停止了一切战斗行动，一瞬前充满炮弹爆炸声和子弹啸声的战场突然沉寂下来。在灰白色的月光下，被击落的敌机仍在燃烧着。停火前在“红山顶”前面被我军炮兵击毁的一辆敌人的坦克，还在冒着白烟。
    停火以后，我军阵地上充满着胜利的欢乐。在被敌人称为“狙击兵岭”阵地上的我军狙击手们，带着杀敌功劳簿走出射击台，快活地计算着被他们歼灭的敌人总数。许多光荣地立了战功的英雄单位，将红色的奖旗插在阵地的高处，让胜利的红旗在夜空中迎风飘扬。立了功的战士们将平日用绸子包着的奖章和勋章戴在胸前。战士们已经认真地学习了金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的停战命令。他们保证坚决遵守停战协定，但是如果敌人胆敢前来侵袭的话，一定打它个不留情！狙击手周尚合写了一封信给他的母亲，报告他在停火前的十二天当中，打死打伤了七十五名敌人的光荣事迹。周尚合对妈妈说：朝中人民军队已经获得了朝鲜停战的光荣胜利，但是他和他的战友们决不松懈麻痹，一定以高度的警惕来保卫胜利。
    在一个挂着汽油灯的我军指挥所里，指挥员们围坐在一张军用地图旁边，谈论着朝中人民部队并肩作战把敌人从鸭绿江边赶回到三八线附近的伟大胜利。他们将刚从祖国运来的葡萄酒倒在杯子里，一齐举杯高呼：“为朝鲜停战的光荣胜利干杯！”“为争取朝鲜停战协定的完全实现而努力！”
    当我军停止了一切战斗行动以后，敌军阵地上的探照灯光也随着熄灭了。敌军士兵们狂欢得简直像度圣诞节之夜似的沸腾起来。他们钻出阴暗的地堡贪婪地呼吸新鲜空气，并立即燃起了无数堆篝火和火把，把他们的阵地映得通红。这时，有一辆救护车从敌军阵地的后方开到被击毁在我军阵地前面的敌军坦克旁边，运走被烧死的美国坦克手。“狙击兵岭”对面的李伪军士兵，也从防炮洞里拖出许多他们同伴的尸体，装上两辆卡车运向后方。在一个美李军阵地的接合部，许多美国士兵和李伪军士兵刚钻出地堡，就将步枪摔在地上，接着又把钢盔扔到山下去。他们庆幸自己还没有成为侵略战争中无谓的牺牲者。
