    On the morning of June 2nd, a car sped towards the Yalu River from somewhere in Korea, braving the rain.

    Ning Jizhi wrapped herself tightly in her raincoat, her eyes gazing serenely at the rain threads in the air. Her face was slightly flushed with the blowing of the wind and rain and the excitement in her heart. She had only received the notice last night, asking her to return to China on behalf of all the youth of the Volunteer Army's Railway Transportation Force to attend the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth.

    When Ning Jizhi heard the news from the secretary of the Party General Branch, she felt unspeakable joy in her heart, but she was also truly reluctant to leave the front. The work here was so intense and enjoyable! The new houses hadn't been built yet, the vegetables in the garden had just begun to sprout leaves, and the entire unit was engaged in a vigorous health campaign, with everyone in her unit striving to win the red flag. There was not a single task that didn't need people! She wondered how she could leave the front!

    However, the task of returning to the motherland was even more important. She set off early the next morning.

    The car sped through the rain. Ning Jizhi's excited heart beat non-stop all the way, and the closer she got to the Yalu River, the harder it beat.

    "We'll be at the Yalu River soon. What does the motherland look like now?" Ning Jizhi thought. It had been more than half a year since she last saw the motherland when she returned to attend the celebration meeting last year. Although half a year wasn't a long time, she knew how much the motherland would have changed! Then she thought of her home by the Yalu River. She had just received a letter from her father a few days ago, telling her that the family was doing well and that they had already received her four merit citation announcements. She could see from the letter how happy her family was.

    The Yalu River was getting closer and closer, and the huge river bridge loomed into view. When she returned to China last year, they had to take a pontoon bridge because this bridge had been bombed. Now, this unyielding bridge stood like a giant over the turbulent river.

    The car sped across the huge river bridge, and everyone in the car sang loudly. Ning Jizhi sang and excitedly stood up, pushing open her raincoat and stretching out her arms, as if to embrace the motherland that was coming towards her.

    Ning Jizhi grew up on the banks of the Yalu River. Her father was a fishing worker who had been trapped on a boat owner's wooden boat for half his life. Her two older brothers worked for landlords all year round, and she herself was often unemployed. However, the result of the family's year of hard work was often that they had nothing to eat. After the liberation of Andong, Ning Jizhi's family underwent great changes: the whole family was allocated six qing of land, her father was freed from the boat owner's dilapidated wooden boat, and her two older brothers were no longer working as beasts of burden for the landlord. Ning Jizhi herself also found a job as a head nurse at Andong Railway Bureau Hospital. At the hospital, she joined the China New Democratic Youth League.

    On the morning of November 8, 1950, the sky was clear, and the green waters of the Yalu River flowed quietly as usual. Suddenly, groups of American planes swooped over the Yalu River and dropped a large number of bombs on the peaceful Korean city of Sinuiju on the other side of the river. The river bridge was bombed, and thick smoke engulfed Sinuiju and rolled from the river surface to Andong City. Ning Jizhi would never forget the scene at that time.

    Soon, Ning Jizhi followed the first batch of railway workers' aid-Korea volunteer team to Korea.

    As soon as she arrived in Korea, she was assigned to the rescue team to carry out rescue missions. In any difficult environment, she never forgot the determination she had expressed to the Party organization of Andong Railway Bureau Hospital before entering Korea: "I am a member of the Youth League, and I will definitely be able to withstand the test of war under any circumstances."

    The first test Ning Jizhi faced after entering Korea was one night in January 1951. Around midnight, with a burst of bombing and strafing by enemy planes, a blaze of fire rose from the railway, and their rescue team set off. It was so dark that nothing could be seen on the road. They stumbled through rice paddies, climbed over hills, and braved the enemy's bombing and strafing, heading straight for the fire.

    In a ditch, they found several wounded soldiers and immediately bandaged them. Just as they finished bandaging the wounded, they heard a child's tragic cry from the nearby bombed houses. Ning Jizhi rushed over without regard for her own safety. Under the collapsed wall of a house, a Korean woman and two children were all injured. The children cried out in pain, and blood flowed from their wounds. Ning Jizhi quickly took out a first-aid kit to bandage them and then sent them to a safe place. As she left, the Korean woman said to her with tears in her eyes: "Thank you! The American devils harmed us, but you saved us!"

    At this time, the comrades behind them had caught up. Three comrades jumped onto the locomotive and drove it into a cave to hide; others jumped onto the burning train cars to rescue materials. After Ning Jizhi and the others finished rescuing the wounded, they also came to help rescue the materials. It wasn't until dawn that everyone finally rescued all the materials.

    From March to August 1951, the enemy carried out so-called "focused bombing" of the Korean railway transport line. During this period, the struggle on the railway transport line became even more intense. The tests Ning Jizhi faced in the struggle became even more numerous and severe.

    One morning in August, everyone was resting, and Ning Jizhi was quietly washing clothes for the resting comrades. Just then, the anti-aircraft guns on both sides of the Qingchuan River suddenly sounded. Ning Jizhi looked up and saw a group of "B-29" bombers flying overhead. She had just shouted out, "Comrades, get up quickly!" when the bombs fell with a piercing whistle, and a gust of wind stirred up by the explosion stunned her. When she woke up, she found that the house had collapsed, but fortunately, two large wooden beams were supporting it, preventing her from being crushed. She had just stood up to see the comrades resting in the house when another batch of bombs fell, and she was stunned again. After more than ten minutes, she slowly woke up, and then she staggered to her feet again, wanting to see the comrades in the house. At this time, the third batch of bombs exploded, and she was stunned on the ground for the third time. When she woke up for the third time, she could no longer stand up. Her limbs were weak, all her joints ached, she saw stars before her eyes, and the smell of gunpowder in the yard choked her throat. But she still did not forget the comrades in the house. A sense of responsibility and love for her comrades prompted her to crawl forward with her weak hands and legs.

    After crawling a short distance, she heard a groan nearby. She looked around and first found the head of the transportation section, Director Dai, pinned under the collapsed house, with only his head and half of his chest exposed. His breathing was rapid and he looked very dangerous. Ning Jizhi crawled a few steps and crawled to Director Dai. At this time, enemy planes were still bombing and strafing, and time bombs were constantly exploding nearby, with bursts of smoke and mud flying around her. Ning Jizhi ignored these things and hurriedly tried to drag Director Dai. But the person was pinned down too tightly, and she couldn't drag him no matter what. So she used her hands to dig out the bricks, tiles, and wood pressing on Director Dai. There were too many and too heavy, and she dug until her hands bled but still couldn't move them. At this time, Director Dai woke up. Seeing Ning Jizhi trying to rescue him, he said to her: "Ning Jizhi, you go away quickly, the enemy is still bombing, don't mind me!" Ning Jizhi knew that although her own life was precious, her comrade's life was just as precious as her own. Therefore, she continued to dig while answering: "Director Dai, I must rescue you." Finally, she rescued Director Dai.

    Afterwards, Ning Jizhi rescued another comrade who had a serious arm injury in another place. She carried them to the homes of the people in the mountain gully behind, quickly bandaged their wounds, and injected them with cardiac stimulants. At this time, she realized that she herself had also been seriously injured. Due to excessive blood loss, she also fainted.

    On November 28, 1952, the secretary of the Party General Branch told Ning Jizhi good news: after a long period of testing, the organization had approved Ning Jizhi's request to join the Party. From that day on, Ning Jizhi continued to fight on the Korean front with the actions of a Communist Party member.

    白衣战士宁吉之
    中干
    一
    六月二日上午，一辆汽车从朝鲜某地冒着雨向鸭绿江飞驰。
    宁吉之把身体紧紧裹在雨衣里，眼睛安详地凝视着空中飘着的雨丝，她的脸因为风雨的吹打和心情的兴奋微微泛起一片红晕。她是昨天晚上才得到通知，要她代表志愿军铁道运输部队的全体青年，回国参加中华全国青年第二次代表大会的。
    当宁吉之听到党总支书记告诉她这个消息的时候，她心中真有说不出的高兴，但是她也实在舍不得离开前方。现在这里的工作是多么紧张和愉快啊！新房子还没盖好，菜地里的青菜刚刚放开叶子，还有整个部队开展了轰轰烈烈的卫生运动，她们单位里大家正努力要夺红旗呢，那一件工作不需要人哪！她想，这怎么能离开前方呢！
    但是，回祖国的任务更加重要。第二天一早她就出发了。
    汽车在雨里飞驰着。宁吉之的激动的心，一路不停地跳着，而且越接近鸭绿江越跳得厉害。
    “前面不远就到鸭绿江了，祖国现在变成什么样子了呢？”宁吉之想：自从去年回国参加庆功会以后，她已经半年多没看到祖国了。虽然半年的时间不算长，可是她知道祖国会有多么大的变化啊！接着她又想起鸭绿江边上的家。几天前她刚刚接到父亲的一封信，信里告诉她，家里的生活很好，而且家里已经接到她的四张立功喜报。从信里可以看到家里的人是多高兴啊。
    鸭绿江越来越近了，巨大的江桥迎面扑来。去年她回国时，因为这座桥被炸坏了，她们只好走便桥。现在，这座不屈的桥，又像巨人一样屹立在滚滚的江流之上了。
    汽车在巨大的江桥上飞驰着，车上所有的人都大声唱起来。宁吉之一边唱着，一边兴奋地站起来，推开雨衣，伸出臂膀，仿佛要去拥抱迎面而来的祖国一样。
    二
    宁吉之从小就生活在鸭绿江边上。父亲是一个捕鱼工人，半辈子被困锁在船主的一条木船上，两个哥哥终年给地主扛活，自己也常常失业。可是，全家一年辛勤劳动的结果，还是常常没有吃的。安东解放以后，寗吉之家里起了很大变化：全家分得了六垧土地，父亲从船主的破木船上解脱出来，两个哥哥也不再给地主当牛马了。寗吉之自己也找到了职业，在安东铁路局医院当护士长。在医院里，她参加了中国新民主主义青年团。
        一九五○年十一月八日那天上午，天空晴朗，鸭绿江碧绿的江水像往日一样静静地流着。突然，成群的美国飞机扑到了鸭绿江上空，向着江对岸朝鲜的和平城市新义州投下了大量的炸弹。江桥被炸毁了，浓烟吞没了新义州，又从江面上滚到安东市。寗吉之永远也忘不了当时的情景。
    不久，寗吉之就随着第一批铁路职工援朝志愿队来到了朝鲜。
    三
    一到朝鲜，她就被编入抢救组，执行救护任务。在任何艰苦的环境下面，她从来没有忘记在入朝以前向安东铁路局医院党组织表示的决心：“我是一个青年团员，我一定能够在任何情况下经得起战争的考验。”
    寗吉之入朝后受到的第一次考验，是在一九五一年一月的一个晚上。大概是半夜时分，随着敌机一阵轰炸和扫射，铁路上腾起一片火光，她们抢救组出发了。天是那样地黑，路上什么都看不见。她们跌跌撞撞地穿过稻田，爬过山坡，冒着敌机的轰炸和扫射，直向那火光跑去。
    在一条沟里，她们找到了几个伤员，就连忙给他们包扎，她们刚把伤员包扎好，又听到附近被炸的房屋里传出一阵小孩的悲惨的哭声。寗吉之不顾一切地冲了过去，在一座被炸塌的墙根下，一个朝鲜妇女和两个孩子都负了伤。孩子痛苦地喊叫着，血从他们的伤口处流出来，寗吉之急忙掏出急救包给他们包扎，然后又把他们送到安全的地方。临走时，那位朝鲜妇女脸上挂着泪珠对她说：“谢谢你！美国鬼子害了我们，你们救了我们！”
    这时候，后面的同志都赶上来了。有三个同志跳上了机车，把它开到山洞里隐蔽起来；另外一些人跳上了着火的车箱抢救物资。寗吉之她们把伤员抢救完毕以后，也赶过来帮助抢救物资。一直到天亮大家终于把物资全部抢救出来。
    四
    从一九五一年三月到八月，敌人对朝鲜铁路运输线进行了所谓“重点轰炸”。在这一时期，铁路运输线上的斗争更加紧张了。寗吉之在斗争中所受的考验也更多更严重了。
    八月的一天上午，大家都在休息，寗吉之悄悄地在给休息的同志洗衣服。正在这时，清川江两岸的高射炮忽然响了起来。寗吉之抬头一看，一群“B—二九”轰炸机已飞到头上。她刚喊出一句：“同志们快起来！”炸弹就带着刺耳的尖啸声落了下来，一阵爆炸激起的风把她震昏了。醒来时，她发现房子已经倒了，幸而有两根大木头支着，使她没有被压住。她刚站起来想去看一看在屋子里休息的同志们，又是一批炸弹落了下来，她又被震昏过去。过了十几分钟，她才慢慢苏醒过来，于是她又摇摇幌幌地站起来，想去看屋子里的同志，这时第三批炸弹又爆炸了，她第三次被震昏在地。等到她第三次醒过来时，再也站不起来了，四肢无力，全身关节都痛，眼前金星乱飞，满院子的火药味呛得她嗓子难受，但是她仍没有忘记屋子里的同志。一种责任感和对同志的爱促使她用软弱无力的手和腿向前爬去。
    爬了不远，附近传来一阵呻吟声。她向四处一望，首先发现运输科的戴科长被压在倒塌的房子下面，只有头和半个胸部露在外面。他的呼吸很急促，看样子很危险。寗吉之急爬了几步，爬到戴科长跟前。这时敌机还在继续轰炸和扫射，定时炸弹也在附近不断地爆炸，一阵阵的浓烟夹着泥土在她身旁乱飞着。寗吉之顾不了这些，急忙去拖戴科长。可是人被压得太紧了，怎么也拖不动，于是她就用双手去扒那些压在戴科长身上的砖瓦和木头，这些东西太多太重，她双手扒出了血也没扒动。这时，戴科长苏醒了，看到寗吉之正在搭救他，就对她说：“寗吉之，你快走开，敌人还在轰炸，别管我！”寗吉之知道，自己的生命虽然是宝贵的，但同志的生命也和自己的一样宝贵，因此，她一面继续扒着，一面回答道：“戴科长，我一定要把你救出去。”最后，她终于把戴科长救了出来。
    随后，寗吉之又在另一个地方救出了一个左臂负重伤的同志。她把他们背到后面山沟里的老百姓家里，迅速地给他们包札好了伤口，注射了强心剂。到这时，她才发现自己身上也负了重伤。由于流血过多，她也昏倒了。
    一九五二年十一月二十八日，党总支书记告诉了寗吉之一个喜讯：经过了长期的考验，组织上批准了寗吉之的入党请求。从那天起，寗吉之又以一个共产党员的行动，继续战斗在朝鲜前线。
