Gong Wenfa of the Dalian Machinery No. 18 Factory is an advanced worker who loves the motherland and works actively, and is a model of abiding by labor discipline.

Gong Wenfa is twenty-two years old this year and has been working for eleven years. During the period of Japanese rule, Gong Wenfa started pulling carts in orchards at the age of eleven to make a living. Later, his leg was crushed by a cart, and the capitalist not only did not give him treatment but also drove him away. Later, he worked as an apprentice at "Mantetsu" where he was often beaten by Japanese foremen. At the age of sixteen, he was seized as a "laborer," carrying wood and doing heavy work all day long, eating coarse grains, with a few drops of bean oil and a few grains of salt in boiling water as the only dish. He soon fell ill. This miserable life of his did not end until the Soviet Red Army liberated the Northeast.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, Gong Wenfa lived a new life. As soon as he entered the factory, he joined the literacy class run by the trade union, realizing his long-dreamed-of desire to study. As an apprentice, he was no longer beaten, and his life improved. Every time Gong Wenfa recalled the past, it aroused his grief and indignation. Comparing it with the present, he felt the warmth and loveliness of the new society from the bottom of his heart, and felt that he must work hard to be worthy of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Therefore, he has always been actively working. He once completed an urgent task ahead of schedule with selfless enthusiasm, supporting the War of Liberation. Later, he was transferred to the Machinery No. 18 Factory, and his work was still so active and responsible. In order to complete the production plan, he overcame various difficulties. For example, the tool for grinding large tool holders weighed forty or fifty pounds, and this work required him and another person to work together; but in March this year, the apprentice who worked with him fell ill, so he took on the work of two people and persisted in completing the monthly production task. He knew that products with poor quality would cause great losses to the country, so he always paid attention to whether iron filings were sticking to the lathe bed during his work, so that the valuable lathe would not malfunction. He also knew that to ensure quantity and quality and not waste national property, accidents must not occur. Therefore, he paid attention at all times during his work, preventing cranes from being damaged and iron rods on the ground from being knocked over. In this way, he had not had a personal accident in six years, nor had he ever damaged a drill or machine.

Gong Wenfa dedicated all his strength to the motherland. In some seemingly ordinary things, he showed his love for labor and his concern for the factory. He had not been absent from work once in six years, nor had he been late or left early. He always prepared for production before starting work every day. Gong Wenfa's home is far from the factory, and there is no car to take, requiring a twenty-five minute walk and climbing over a small hill; but no matter how strong the wind, rain, or snow, it could not stop him from arriving at the factory on time. He paid great attention to physical exercise, remembering the saying: "Health is the capital of revolution." Therefore, he had not had a major illness, and he persisted in working even with minor illnesses. It was not that he had no personal matters at all. Last June, his uncle died in the hospital, and his family sent a message asking him to go quickly, but at that time, production was tight, and he thought that national affairs were more important than personal affairs, so he went after work. He always handled his personal affairs on Sundays, never encroaching on working hours. Why is this? Because he was always calculating the interests of the country: "It doesn't matter if an individual takes a break, but the country's loss is great. Now the labor organization is very detailed. If one person takes a break, our team will produce one less lathe a day, and the next process will also produce one less. Producing one less lathe will cause the country to lose more than 100 million yuan. If a person is ten minutes late, the whole factory will wait for his work, and everyone in the factory will be delayed for ten minutes. How can this loss be calculated? We must care about the factory as if it were our own home!"

Gong Wenfa is not satisfied with completing the work of himself and his team, and he is also very concerned about the overall interests. Last September, all the teams in the workshop were confident of completing their tasks, but Liu Qingzhu's team had difficulties in completing their tasks. Gong Wenfa immediately took the initiative to propose to the leadership to help the team. He finally helped the team find a trick, which increased the team's output by more than double and ensured the completion of the factory's task.

Gong Wenfa joined the Youth League in 1949 and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China last year. He won first prize in every quarterly award in the factory, and this year he was named a labor model in the Northeast region, and recently he was elected as a delegate to the National Congress of the Youth League. His advanced thinking and advanced deeds inspire every worker. Since its establishment, no one in his youth team has been absent from work without reason, and they have completed their production tasks every month. In the current labor competition in the Machinery No. 18 Factory, all workers are taking him as an example, determined to strengthen labor discipline and resolutely complete the national production plan.

### 宫文发遵守劳动纪律六年没有发生事故

    宫文发遵守劳动纪律六年没有发生事故
    大连机械十八厂宫文发，是热爱祖国、积极劳动的先进工人，是遵守劳动纪律的模范。
    宫文发今年二十二岁，已做了十一年工了。日寇统治时期，宫文发为了生活，十一岁时就开始在果木园拉车子，后来被车子轧坏了腿，资本家不但不给治疗，反而把他赶走了。以后他在“满铁”当学徒，经常挨日本工头的痛打。十六岁时他又被抓去当“劳工”，整天抬木头、干重活，吃的是粗粮，在开水里滴几滴豆油，放几粒盐就当菜吃。不久他就病倒了。他这种苦难的生活，直到苏联红军解放东北，才算结束了。
    解放以后，在共产党领导下，宫文发过着新的生活。刚进工厂，他就参加了工会办的识字班，实现了过去一直梦想着的读书的愿望。当学徒也不再挨揍了，生活也好了。宫文发每次想起过去，总要引起悲愤来，对比现在，就从心里感到新社会的温暖和可爱，觉得必须好好劳动，才对得起毛主席、共产党。因此，他一贯积极工作。他曾以忘我的工作热情，提前完成了一项紧急任务，支援了解放战争。后来他调到机械十八厂，工作仍是那么积极负责。为了完成生产计划，他克服了各种困难。例如：磨研大刀架的工具重四五十斤，这项工作要他和另一个人同时协力去干才行；可是今年三月，和他一起干活的学徒生病了，他就一个人顶两个人坚持着干下去，完成了当月的生产任务。他知道，生产质量不好的产品，就会给国家造成很大损失，因此他在工作中就随时随地留心有没有铁末子沾上床子，这样，就使价值昂贵的床子不出毛病。他也知道，要保证产量质量，不浪费国家财产，就不能发生事故。因此他在工作中就随时注意，不让吊车碰伤了，不让地上的铁棍给磕倒了。就是这样，六年来他没有发生过一次人身事故，也从来没有损坏过
    一具电钻或机器。
    宫文发把自己的全部力量献给了祖国，在一些看来似乎很平凡的事情上，他都表现了对劳动的热爱和对工厂的关心。他六年来没有欠勤过一次，迟到、早退也没有过。他每天总是在生产前做好生产的准备工作。宫文发的家离工厂很远，而且没有车可乘，要走二十五分钟路，还要爬过一座小山头；可是无论刮多么大的风，下多么大的雨和雪，都阻挡不了他按时到工厂。他非常注意锻炼身体，他牢记这句话：“身体是革命的本钱”。因此他没有生过大病，而小病就坚持工作下去。他也并不是一点私事都没有，去年六月，他大爷死在医院里，家里捎信叫他快去，而当时生产正紧张，他想国家的事比个人的事要紧，还是下了班才去。他有什么私事，总是放到星期日去办，决不侵占工作时间。为什么这样呢？因为他时时刻刻都在计算着国家的利益：“个人歇一次工没什么，国家的损失可大了。现在劳动组织划得很细，一个人歇一个工，咱组一天就少出一台床子，下一工序也少出一台，少出一台床子就使国家损失一亿多元。如果一个人迟到十分钟，全厂都等他的活，全厂的人都要为他耽误十分钟，这损失怎样计算？必须把工厂当自己的家一般关心！”
    宫文发不以完成个人和本组的工作为满足，他还很关心整体利益。去年九月，车间各组都有把握完成任务，只有刘清竹组完成任务有困难，宫文发立刻主动向领导方面提出去帮助该组，他终于帮助该组找出一个窍门，使该组产量提高一倍多，保证了全厂任务的完成。
    宫文发在一九四九年加入青年团，去年光荣地参加了中国共产党。工厂每次季奖他都获得一等奖，今年他被评为东北区劳动模范，最近又被选为出席青年团全国代表大会的代表。他的先进思想、先进事迹鼓舞着每个工人。他的青年小组成立以来，从来没有人无故欠勤，月月完成生产任务。在目前机械十八厂的劳动竞赛中，全体工人又以他为榜样，决心加强劳动纪律，坚决完成国家生产计划。
