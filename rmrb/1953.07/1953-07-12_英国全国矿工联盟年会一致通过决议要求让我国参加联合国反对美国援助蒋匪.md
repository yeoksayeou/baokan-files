Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 11th: The London "Daily Worker" Hastings reported on the 8th that representatives of the 700,000 miners participating in the National Union of Mineworkers Annual Conference unanimously passed a resolution demanding that People's China be admitted to the United Nations.

The resolution requests that the government immediately use its influence to stop American imperialism from aiding Chiang Kai-shek. The resolution points out that taking this action will bring peace to the war-torn Far East and will have a great impact on maintaining world peace.

The representative from Somerset, who proposed the motion, said, "We believe that as long as the United States continues to send weapons to Taiwan, there will be a danger of war in the Far East. War anywhere is a serious threat to the whole world."

    英国全国矿工联盟年会一致通过决议要求让我国参加联合国反对美国援助蒋匪
    【新华社柏林十一日电】伦敦“工人日报”哈斯丁斯八日消息：参加全国矿工联盟年会的七十万矿工的代表一致通过一项决议，要求接纳人民中国参加联合国。
    决议要求政府立刻利用它的影响制止美帝国主义援助蒋介石。决议指出，采取这种行动会给受战争破坏的远东带来和平，并会对维护世界和平发生巨大影响。
    提出这项动议的索墨塞特的代表说：“我们认为只要美国继续把武器送往台湾，远东便存在着战争的危险。任何地方的战争都是对全世界的严重威胁。”
