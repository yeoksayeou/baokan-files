    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau's Self-Criticism Regarding the Untimely Ordering of Lathes
    A letter from the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau: The situation reflected in Comrade Lu Yuan's letter published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on May 18th, regarding the delay of nearly two years in resolving the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau's need to add a lathe, is indeed true. In 1951, a total of ten lathes were needed for the nationwide telegraph repair equipment (one of which was for the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau). At that time, we had excessively high quality requirements and specified the brand, requesting the supply bureau to order them; the supply bureau was unable to procure them, so we allocated funds to the regional management bureaus for self-purchase. The Central-South Regional Management Bureau, due to the difficulty in procurement, requested the supply bureau to purchase them on their behalf. In December 1951, we received a notification from the supply bureau that the lathes had been purchased, so we informed the Central-South Regional Management Bureau to report them in the annual final accounts and approved the lathe budget. However, when inspecting the lathes in March 1952, we found the quality to be poor and returned them; in May, we again notified the Central-South Regional Management Bureau to remove the budget item from the basic construction project final accounts and resolve it themselves within the miscellaneous projects (at that time, we did not deeply understand whether the actual figures for miscellaneous basic construction could bear it). Later, the Central-South Regional Management Bureau pointed out that the control number for miscellaneous basic construction was limited, so we agreed to include the lathe budget in the 1952 basic construction project, and went through the procedures for reporting approval and signing contracts. As a result, the lathe could not be delivered in 1952, and we had to notify it to be carried over to the 1953 fiscal year.
    The above facts show that we did not consider the work of adding a lathe to the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau thoroughly enough in advance, and our communication with other units was not close enough. We only relied on subjective wishes and official documents to work, which not only failed to solve the problem early, but also increased the burden on subordinate organs, resulting in losses in both manpower and material resources. We are determined to improve this situation.

    邮电部长途电信总局关于订购车床不及时的检讨
    中央邮电部长途电信总局来信：五月十八日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊陆远同志来信中反映的长沙电信局增添车床问题拖延将近二年未获解决的情况，是确实的。一九五一年全国电报修机设备所需车床共十部（其中一部即长沙电信局的）。我们当时对质量要求过高，指定了牌号，请供应局订购；供应局没有采购到，我们就拨款给各区管理局自购。中南区管理局因采购不易，再请供应局代购。一九五一年十二月我们得到供应局关于车床已经购妥的通知，就转知中南区管理局在年度决算内列报，并核定了车床预算。但到一九五二年三月验收车床时，发现品质不良，因而退货；我们在五月间再通知中南区管理局在基本建设工程决算内剔除该项预算，另在零星工程内自行解决（当时我们并没有深入了解零星基本建设实际数字是否能负担）。后来中南区管理局提出零星基本建设控制数有限，我们又同意将该项车床预算列入一九五二年基本建设工程，再办呈准及订约等手续。这样，车床就无法在一九五二年交货，只好又通知结转到一九五三年度内。
    以上事实，说明我们对待长沙电信局增添车床这一工作，事前考虑得不够周到，和其他单位联系也不够密切，只凭主观愿望和公文来工作，以致非但没有及早解决问题，反而增加了下级机关的负担，在人力物力上都遭受损失。我们决心改进这种情况。
