Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 21st: According to TASS, the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the French General Confederation of Labor regarding the bloody events in Paris on July 14th.

The WFTU's telegram emphasized: The bloody provocation against the workers of Paris, especially the North African workers, on July 14th, is a vile attempt to divide and intimidate the working class. However, this provocation has backfired on the instigators themselves, prompting the working people of France and their North African brothers to strengthen their unity and friendship even more.

The Secretariat of the WFTU, representing 80 million members, protests this crime and assures the workers of Algeria of its full support in their struggle for a better life, independence, and peace.

The WFTU calls on all workers, regardless of nationality or trade union affiliation, to close ranks, strengthen solidarity, and strive for happiness, freedom, national independence, and peace.

    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十一日讯：世界工会联合会为七月十四日在巴黎发生的血腥事件，打电报给法国总工会。
    世界工联的电报着重指出：七月十四日对巴黎工人，主要是对北非工人的血腥挑衅，是一种想分裂和恫吓工人阶级的罪恶企图。但是这种挑衅反害了煽动者自己，它促使法国劳动人民和他们的北非兄弟更加强他们的团结和友谊。
    世界工联书记处代表八千万会员，对这件罪行表示抗议，并向阿尔及利亚的工人保证，它要全力声援他们争取美好生活、独立与和平的斗争。
    世界工联号召所有工人，不分国籍和工会关系，紧密他们的队伍，加强团结，来争取幸福、自由、民族独立与和平。
