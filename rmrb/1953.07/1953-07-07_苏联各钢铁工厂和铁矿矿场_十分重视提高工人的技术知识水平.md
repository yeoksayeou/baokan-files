Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd Dispatch from TASS: Currently, approximately 100,000 steelworkers in steel factories and iron ore mines across the Soviet Union are participating in examinations at technical schools and training classes.

The Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Steelworkers' Union, Mikhail Yevstratov, told a TASS reporter about the studies of Soviet steelworkers: Currently, the Soviet Union is equipping the metallurgical industry with the latest Soviet-made machinery and is widely adopting new production technologies in the metallurgical industry. This requires every worker to master comprehensive knowledge. In the Soviet Union, the most common way to improve workers' production knowledge is to hold worker technical training classes and schools to promote advanced production experience, where production innovators impart production experience. Workers study free of charge in these schools and training classes, as well as in the branches of secondary specialized schools and universities established in various enterprises. Last year, the Soviet Union allocated 35 million rubles for the study of steelworkers, and this year it has increased to nearly 56.65 million rubles.

Yevstratov pointed out that in recent years, the scale of these schools and training classes has been expanding, the duration of teaching has been extended, and the theoretical research has also deepened. After studying, the workers' technical skills and knowledge have greatly improved, and many can effectively operate machines and reduce the consumption of raw materials and fuel. For example, many steelworkers at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works are currently studying advanced production technology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and literature in the factory's special technical training class. The curriculum of the training class has been formulated according to the curriculum of secondary specialized schools. In the past five years, the factory has graduated approximately one thousand workers from these training classes. They are now working in various workshops and have achieved excellent production results. Recently, steelworker Ivan Semenov has completed six months of the plan ahead of schedule and is completing the production quota for July. He reduced the time for smelting a furnace of steel by one hour, thereby increasing steel production by 16 percent. At the Ural New Tagil Steel Plant, one in three workers is studying in training classes this year. In addition, hundreds of workers are studying in secondary night schools, and more than three hundred workers are studying in the night schools of the Mining Institute and the Comprehensive Technical Institute. It is estimated that the labor productivity of the workers who have recently graduated from the school for promoting advanced technology at the factory increased by an average of 20 percent in the first quarter of this year.

Yevstratov concluded: The distribution network of schools and training classes in the Soviet metallurgical industry is still expanding. Currently, 56 training centers have been established in various enterprises and iron ore mines. All these training centers have well-equipped classrooms, laboratories, and all the necessary textbooks and teaching aids.

    苏联各钢铁工厂和铁矿矿场
    十分重视提高工人的技术知识水平
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：目前苏联各地钢铁工厂和铁矿矿场中，约有十万个钢铁工人正在参加技术学校和训练班的考试。
    苏联炼钢工人工会中央委员会副主席米哈伊尔·叶夫斯特拉托夫对塔斯社记者谈述苏联钢铁工人的学习时说：现在，苏联正在以苏联制造的最新式的机器装备冶金工业，并在冶金工业中广泛采用新的生产技术，这就要求每个工人都能掌握全面的知识。在苏联，提高工人的生产知识的最普遍的方式是举办工人技术训练班和推广先进生产经验的学校，由生产革新者传授生产经验。工人们在这些学校和训练班以及设立在各企业中的中等专科学校和高等学校的分校中学习都是免费的。去年，苏联拨给钢铁工人的学习费用达三千五百万卢布，今年更增加为将近五千六百五十万卢布。
    叶夫斯特拉托夫指出：最近几年中，这些学校和训练班规模日益扩大，教学期限延长了，理论的研究也加深了。学习后，工人技术和知识都大大提高，很多人都能有效地操使机器并减低原料和燃料的消耗。例如，马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁工厂的许多炼钢工人，现在正在该厂的特别技术训练班学习先进的生产技术、数学、物理、化学和文学。训练班的课程已根据中等专科学校的课程制订。在过去五年中，该厂已约有一千个工人从这些训练班里毕业。他们现在正在各车间里工作，并获得了很好的生产成绩。最近，炼钢工人伊凡·西麦诺夫已提前完成了六个月的计划，正在完成七月份的生产定额。他把炼一炉钢的时间减少了一小时，从而把钢的产量增加了百分之十六。在乌拉尔新塔基尔钢铁厂，今年每三个工人中就有一个在训练班学习。此外，还有几百个工人正在中等夜校里学习，三百多个工人正在矿业学院和综合技术学院的夜校中学习。据估计，该厂新从推广先进技术的学校毕业的工人的劳动生产率在今年第一季度中，就平均增加了百分之二十。
    叶夫斯特拉托夫最后说：苏联冶金工业中的学校和训练班的分布网还在不断扩大。现在，各企业和铁矿中已设立了五十六个训练中心。所有这些训练中心都有设备齐全的教室、实验室和一切必要的教科书和教学用具。
