    Total Lunar Eclipse to Occur on the Evening of the 26th of this Month

    A total lunar eclipse will occur on the evening of July 26th (Lunar June 16th). The total duration of the lunar eclipse will be three and a half hours, with the total eclipse lasting one hour and forty-one minutes. This lunar eclipse is the longest total lunar eclipse of the twentieth century. Except for areas west of Shule County in Xinjiang Province in the far west of China, the rest of the country will be able to see this lunar eclipse.

    The lunar eclipse will begin at 6:33 PM Beijing time on the 26th (referred to as "initial eclipse"), but at this time the moon will not yet have risen in China, so the initial eclipse will not be visible anywhere in the country. The total eclipse will begin at 7:30 PM (referred to as "totality"). The total eclipse will end at 9:11 PM, and the moon will begin to show light (referred to as "emergence"). At 10:09 PM, the moon will be fully restored. East of a line from Ulanhot, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Luoyang, Yichang, Zhijiang, to Longzhou, the moon will have already risen with a large portion missing, which is called "rising with partial eclipse." This area will be able to see the moon gradually entering the Earth's shadow to become a total eclipse, and the emergence from the total eclipse to full restoration. West of this line to east of a line from Hami to Xigaze, the moon will have already been in total eclipse when it rises, and only the emergence and restoration phases can be seen. In areas west of Hami and Xigaze, including Dihua, Tacheng, Yining, Shache, and other places, only the phase after emergence can be seen. Areas further west will not be able to see this lunar eclipse at all.

    本月二十六日晚将发生月全食
    七月二十六日（阴历六月十六）晚上将发生月全食。月食时间总长为三小时半，全食时间占一小时四十一分。这次月食是二十世纪以来时间最长的一次月全食。我国除极西部的新疆省疏勒县以西地区外，其他地区都可看到这次月食。
    这次月食开始在二十六日晚上北京时间六时三十三分（称为“初亏”），这时在我国月亮还没有上升，所以全国各地都看不见初亏。七时三十分开始全食（称为“食既”）。九时十一分全食完毕，月亮开始露光（称为“生光”）。十时零九分月亮复圆。我国自乌兰浩特、北京、石家庄、洛阳、宜昌、芷江、龙州一线的东面，月亮上升时已经缺了一大块，这叫“带食而出”。这一带地区可以看到月亮逐渐投入地影成为全食以及从全食看到复圆。这条线的西面到哈密、日喀则一线以东地区，月亮上升时已经全食，只能看到全食后生光、复圆的一段。在哈密、日喀则以西地区，包括迪化、塔城、伊宁、莎车等地，只能看到生光后的一段。再西边的地区就完全看不到这次月食。
