Xinxiang Special District in Henan Province, drawing on its experience in drought-resistant sowing over the years, simultaneously carried out harvesting and sowing, and seized the time after rain to rush planting. By June 22nd, the district had basically completed summer planting on 5.4 million mu of land after the wheat harvest. The characteristics of this year's summer planting are: timely planting (the period from Mangzhong to Summer Solstice is the most suitable time for summer planting in our district); the planted area has expanded compared to previous years; and in general, attention has been paid to selecting fine varieties and rational close planting. According to preliminary understanding, the summer planting area in the district has expanded by 360,000 mu compared to last year. The summer planting area of agricultural producers' cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams has expanded even more. The Zhangzhuang Yuanyoufeng Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in the Fourth District of Ji County left 100 mu of fallow dry land last year, but only 19 mu this year. Wuzhi's Sixth District planted 50,000 mu, all densely planted, with about 60% of the corn retaining around 2,500 seedlings. In Dawenan Village, Xiuwu, among 1,851 mu of corn, 1,815 mu used fine varieties such as Jinhuanghou and Dahongpao, and the seeds of 1,261 mu were also soaked and mixed. All of these have laid a good foundation for the autumn bumper harvest campaign.

However, after the summer planting is completed, attention should also be paid to the following in the future autumn bumper harvest campaign: (1) Close planting has brought a series of new problems to the management of autumn crops this year. For example, watering, fertilization, and technical management should be strengthened after the implementation of close planting. However, many cadres currently have the idea that close planting is all that is needed. This must be corrected. (2) Rushing to plant while the soil is moist means that most crops are sown at the same time, and checking seedlings, replanting, thinning, and weeding are all crowded together, making labor more difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to give full play to the role of organization and pay attention to mobilizing women to participate in production. (3) In some areas, because of the rush to plant, cultivation and sowing were done very roughly. In Qinyang's Sixth District, of the 10,299 mu planted, 8,819 mu were planted in wheat stubble. In some areas, planting was done without plowing, or the plowing was very rough, and some did not apply base fertilizer, which increased the burden of summer hoeing and topdressing. The Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed all counties to pay attention to the above issues. Currently, the entire district has had thorough rain, and most of the autumn seedlings have emerged, further increasing the masses' confidence in striving for an autumn bumper harvest. (Cheng Bin)

    新乡专区夏播工作胜利完成
    河南新乡专区接受了历年抗旱下种的经验，与麦收同时，开展了边收边种和雨后抢种工作。麦收后全区五百四十万亩的夏播工作到六月二十二日止已基本完成。今年夏种的特点是：种的适时（芒种到夏至是我区夏播最适时的季节）；播种面积较往年有扩大；一般的注意了选用良种和合理密植。据初步了解，全区夏播面积，较去年扩大三十六万亩。农业生产合作社与常年互助组的夏播面积扩大的更多。汲县四区张庄原有峰农业生产合作社，去年留垡旱地一百亩，今年只留十九亩，武陟六区下种五万亩，全部密植。其中约有百分之六十的玉茭留苗二千五百棵左右。修武大文案村一千八百五十一亩玉茭，有一千八百一十五亩选用金黄后、大红袍等良种，其中有一千二百六十一亩的种籽还经过浸拌种。所有这些给秋季丰产运动奠定了良好基础。
    但是，夏播结束后，在今后开展秋季丰产运动中还应注意：（一）密植之后给今年秋季作物管理带来了一系列的新问题。例如浇水、施肥、技术管理，在实行密植后应更加强指导，但当前许多干部有密植种上完事大吉的思想，必须加以纠正。（二）趁墒抢种，大部作物在同一时期下种，查苗补苗间苗中耕挤在一块，劳力更感困难，因此必须发挥组织起来的作用，和注意发动妇女参加生产。（三）部分地区因为抢种，耕作下种都作的很粗糙。沁阳六区下种一万零二百九十九亩，即有八千八百一十九亩麦茬下种。有些地区有的未耕即下种，或耕的很粗，有的未施底肥，这就加重了夏锄与施追肥的任务。以上问题中共新乡地委已指示各县加以注意。目前全区普落透雨，大部秋苗已经出土，更增加了群众争取秋季丰产的信心。（承斌）
