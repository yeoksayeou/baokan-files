Zhejiang Province Strengthens Leadership over Farm Tool Handicraft Workers
Manufacturing and Repairing Farm Tools to Support Farmers' Timely Harvesting

Zhejiang Province's early rice crop is about to be harvested in large quantities. Party and government leaders at all levels throughout the province and relevant departments are strengthening their leadership over farm tool handicraft workers, directing them to focus on rural areas to manufacture and repair farm tools, and supporting farmers in timely harvesting.

Before the early rice harvest, it was discovered in Zhejiang Province that there was a significant shortage of farm tools. This situation attracted the attention of local Party and government leadership departments. The CPC Taizhou Prefectural Committee, in its recent "Instructions on Agricultural Production Work during the Early Rice Harvest," explicitly stated that thorough preparations should be made for the early rice harvest. It required all localities to immediately organize mountainous and urban wood and bamboo handicraft industries to produce large quantities of rice buckets and bamboo baskets, and to appropriately organize handicrafts to go to the countryside to help farmers repair old farm tools. The City Work Department of the CPC Shouchang County Committee held a forum in the county town of Chengguan, bringing together bamboo handicraft workers and farmer representatives, to discuss the issue of adding and repairing farm tools. The three townships of Qiu'ai, Xinle, and Dongya in Yin County also jointly held a worker-peasant forum. The meeting revealed that the demand for farm tools from farmers in these three townships was very large; however, with the harvest imminent, supply was insufficient. After consultation, it was decided that the focus should be on repairing old farm tools, with appropriate manufacturing of new ones, and four households that originally made bamboo products were mobilized to produce small farm tools. In order to reduce costs and alleviate the burden on farmers, wood handicraft workers in Qiu'ai Township also changed the source of raw materials to local materials. As a result, the price of each rice bucket was reduced from the original 200,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan. In some areas, in order to enable handicraft workers to better and more systematically serve agricultural production, a "triangular contract" method was adopted, jointly signed by the People's Bank, supply and marketing cooperatives, and handicraft production groups. The Chengguan Town Bamboo Production Group in Fenghua solved its financial difficulties after signing a "triangular contract" and also achieved planned supply through the supply and marketing cooperative. The quality and specifications of the products also largely met the standards. After handicraft workers faced the countryside, they not only expanded the sales of their products, but also significantly improved the quality, which was welcomed by the majority of farmers. The Zhuangqiao Bamboo Production Cooperative in Cixi County fulfilled its contract to supply more than 400 pieces of bamboo products to farms and agricultural production cooperatives. It has now signed a large-scale farm tool production and sales contract with the local supply and marketing cooperative. Because they actively serve farmers, their turnover in the first half of the year increased by more than 67 percent compared to the same period last year, and they accumulated 3 million yuan in funds.

    浙江省加强对农具手工业者的领导
    制造和修理农具支援农民及时收割
    浙江省早稻就要大量登场。全省各地党政领导方面和有关部门正加强对农具手工业者的领导，使他们面向农村制造和修理农具，支援农民及时收割。
    浙江省各地在早稻收割之前，发现农具缺得很多。这一情况引起了各地党政领导部门的重视，中共台州地委在最近发出的“关于早稻收割期间农业生产工作的指示”中，明确指出要充分做好收割早稻的准备工作。要求各地立即组织山区与城镇木器、竹器手工业大量生产稻桶、竹箩，并适当组织手工业下乡，帮助农民修补旧农具。中共寿昌县县委城工部在该县城关镇召开了竹业手工业者及农民代表座谈会，讨论添修农具的问题。鄞县邱隘、新乐、东雅三个乡也联合召开了工、农座谈会，会上发现该三乡农民需要供应的农具数量很大；但目前收割在即，已供应不及。经协商结果，认为应该以修理旧农具为主，适当制造新的，并且动员了四户原来做篾竹工的赶制小农具。为了降低成本，减轻农民的负担，邱隘镇的木业手工业者又在原料来源上改为就地取材，这样，使每只稻桶由原来的二十万元降低到十二万元。有的地区为了使手工业者能够更好地和更有计划地为农业生产服务，并采取了由人民银行、供销合作社和手工业生产小组三方面共同订立“三角合同”的办法。奉化城关镇篾竹生产小组在订立了“三角合同”后，解决了资金困难，还通过供销合作社做到有计划地供应。产品质量规格也大都合乎标准。各地手工业者面向农村后，不但扩大了产品的销路，质量也有显著提高，受到广大农民的欢迎。慈溪县庄桥篾竹生产合作社履行了为农场、农业生产合作社供应四百多件竹器的合同后，现在又和当地供销合作社订好大批农具的产销合同。由于他们积极为农民服务，上半年营业额比去年同期增加百分之六十七以上，并积累了三百万元资金。　（新华社）
