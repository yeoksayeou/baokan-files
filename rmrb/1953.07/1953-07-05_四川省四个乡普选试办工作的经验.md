Experiences in Pilot Universal Suffrage in Four Townships of Sichuan Province

    Since the end of April to early June, the Sichuan Provincial Election Committee conducted pilot universal suffrage work in Gongnong Township of Neijiang County, Yufeng Township of Suining County, Shuanglong Township of Jiangjin County, and Hesheng Township of Wenjiang County, and gained some experience.

    Regarding the division of electoral districts in the four townships, three townships consistently adopted the method of dividing a natural village into one electoral district and a residential group into one voter group. However, practice has proven that this method is not appropriate, because the size of natural villages varies. If electoral districts and voter groups are divided according to the original natural villages and residential groups, some would be too large, making it inconvenient for mass gatherings and difficult to combine with production leadership. In Hesheng Township of Wenjiang County, one electoral district had a population of more than 2,000 people and stretched for more than ten li. Gongnong Township of Neijiang County initially adopted this method, but found it inconvenient during population investigation and voter registration. It then changed to dividing seven or eight courtyards with about one hundred households into one electoral district, with each electoral district producing two to three representatives; the township's original sixty-nine residential groups were divided into one hundred and sixty-four voter groups. This made it convenient for conducting election activities and combining with production leadership. At the same time, because the masses were familiar with each other, it was also easier to deliberate on candidates. The participation rate of voters in Gongnong Township reached 91.6 percent, which is inseparable from the appropriate division of electoral districts and voter groups.

    Before the population investigation and voter registration, all four townships conducted propaganda and mobilization work. The timing and methods of population investigation and voter registration in each township took into account the principle of not delaying mass production. There were two approaches. One was to use all evening time, adopting the method of setting up registration stations mainly in courtyards and mobile registration, registering while reviewing voter qualifications, propagandizing, and issuing voter certificates. The other was to use agricultural slack time during the day to first investigate the population, review voter qualifications in the evening, and then hold a village meeting to uniformly issue voter certificates while conducting propaganda. The former method is better. In addition to setting up mobile registration stations in voter groups or courtyards, remote mountainous areas can also arrange times to go for registration, supplemented by door-to-door investigation for individual special cases, so that it can be done comprehensively and accurately.

    Each electoral district had a voter qualification review group, generally consisting of three to five people, including one working group cadre from the electoral district, one public security committee member, and one to three activists. The review group did not review all voters, but focused on reviewing a few people. Voters with the right to vote received voter certificates while registering. For landlord class elements and counter-revolutionaries under control who had been determined to have no right to vote, the working cadres explained to them the reason for not issuing voter certificates. The only people with more complicated issues were a small number of landlord family children, daughters-in-law, and counter-revolutionaries who had not been placed under control. If a decision could not be made at that time for these people, it was explained that it would be reviewed and determined by the election committee; and they were told that if they had any opinions, they could raise them with the election committee.

        The election work was combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, coercion, and violations of law and discipline, with the nomination of candidates being the
    main link. The experience of the four townships proves that only by combining the struggle against bureaucracy and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses can candidates be nominated well. Where this issue was resolved well, the nomination of candidates was smooth; the masses also supported the list of candidates proposed by the election committee; and the opinions raised by the masses mostly concerned how the representative candidates could improve their work and correct their shortcomings in the future. Where this issue was not resolved well, the masses had many opinions during the nomination of candidates. The general practice of the four townships to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses was to first convene a meeting of key members (Party members, League members, main cadres, and activists), explain the policies in detail, affirm achievements, stabilize emotions, and mobilize them to consciously and actively examine their own shortcomings. Then, the nature of the problems was clarified. Those that should be the responsibility of the higher authorities were reviewed by the higher authorities or representatives of the work team; those that should be the responsibility of the cadres themselves were patiently educated to recognize the root causes of the errors and pointed out the direction for future improvement. Cadres generally conducted self-criticism only at representative meetings, focusing on checking relevant leadership issues; and the masses were educated in advance to examine the cadres comprehensively, avoiding the formation of a struggle situation. After the four townships resolved the relationship between cadres and the masses, the vast majority of cadres were still loved by the masses and were nominated as representative candidates.

    There were two methods for nominating representative candidates in the four townships. One was for the Party, League branches, and various people's organizations to jointly consult and propose candidates, submit the list to the masses for discussion and deliberation, widely absorb opinions, and remove those that the majority of the masses were dissatisfied with, and supplement newly proposed ones. After the deliberation was relatively mature, the initial list of candidates was officially announced, and after the masses had carefully deliberated for twenty days, the official list of representative candidates was announced to the voters five days before the election meeting. The result of this approach in some electoral districts of Yufeng Township in Suining County was that the nomination of candidates was more concentrated, and the masses also felt that the election committee respected everyone's opinions. The other was to nominate purely from the bottom up, resulting in many nominations, making it difficult for the masses to deliberate and discuss, and difficult to reach a consensus. This approach was sometimes due to insufficient preparation work; but mainly because some cadres had remnants of old democratic ideas, believing that this was democracy, but in fact, it affected the development of true democracy.

    The experience of the four townships proves that the success of the election meeting is inseparable from a series of propaganda, education, and organization work in the entire universal suffrage process; at the same time, various preparatory work before the meeting and control during the meeting are also very important. Gongnong Township of Neijiang County did a better job, and the experience is: 1. The election date was chosen on days when there were no market days nearby and not the busiest days for production. 2. Attention was paid to mobilizing women: mobilizing women through men (reducing obstacles), and educating women through female activists (breaking feudal ideas), so that the masses recognized the importance of women's participation in politics. 3. Solving the specific difficulties of the masses participating in the meeting. For example, organizing older children to watch the door, do chores, and take care of children, and organizing Youth League members and militia members under the age of eighteen to maintain public order during the meeting, so that everyone could be more at ease during the meeting. 4. Notifying voters again the day before the election meeting to attend on time. The election meetings in each electoral district of the township were generally very successful, with the highest proportion of voters participating in the election reaching 93.6 percent, and the lowest reaching 88 percent. However, the preparatory work for the election meeting in Hesheng Township of Wenjiang County was very poor. Before the meeting, the leading cadres believed that holding an election meeting was just "everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking," and did not carefully study the difficulties of the electoral district being too large and the masses participating in the meeting; nor did they carefully consider the tense production situation of the masses planting rice seedlings and retting hemp at that time; at the same time, the entire township adopted a "full flowering" approach, resulting in fewer voters arriving. According to the actual investigation after the election in Lianglukou electoral district of Shuanglong Township in Jiangjin County, as long as the work is done well and the political enthusiasm of the masses is brought into play, it is possible to strive for a high proportion of voters participating in the election. There were 482 voters in the electoral district, and only 320 people participated in the voting this time. A total of 162 people did not attend, including 58 people engaged in small business by the nearby highway; 40 people (mainly women) setting up stalls in the street or feeding pigs at home; 15 people going to nearby market days; 12 people who were deaf, blind, sick, giving birth, or unable to come because of deaths in their families; 12 people visiting relatives; in addition, there were those teaching in other villages and those studying at school, those staying on duty in the organs, etc.; only one voter in the entire electoral district truly did not participate in the voting for no reason. If propaganda, education, and organization work were done well before the meeting, and the time for the meeting was arranged appropriately, the voters who did not attend, except for the 26 people who were sick, giving birth, etc., could have come to participate in the meeting.

    At present, except for Hesheng Township, the other three townships have convened their first township people's congresses. At this meeting, they focused on solving one or two major problems that the local masses urgently needed to solve, especially the current production problems and overcoming the "five excesses" phenomenon. Yufeng Township of Suining County focused on solving some problems of drought resistance, water conservation, and seedling protection in the township. At the meeting, the township head and government committee members were also elected, the township's various organizations were rectified, and various practical systems were formulated. The township head and clerk did not hold concurrent positions, and other committee members concurrently served as directors of relevant committees, divided their work according to regions, and helped promote the work of each village. In terms of the archives system, it was decided to change the past chaotic situation and strictly control the filling of forms and reports. It was also decided to mutually elect one representative director within the scope of natural villages, responsible for contacting representatives, implementing resolutions, and promoting work, overcoming the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas. Other townships also solved similar problems, consolidating the achievements of the universal suffrage work.

    四川省四个乡普选试办工作的经验
    四川省选举委员会自四月底至六月初在内江县工农乡、遂宁县玉峰乡、江津县双龙乡、温江县和盛乡进行了普选试办工作，得到了一些经验。
    四个乡的选区划分，有三个乡一直采用以一个自然村划为一个选区、一个居民小组划为一个选民小组的办法。但事实证明，这种办法并不妥善，因为自然村的大小不一，如一律按原来的自然村和居民小组划分选区和选民小组，有的就嫌过大，群众集会不方便，结合领导生产也有困难。温江县和盛乡有一个选区，人口多到二千多人，长达十余里。内江县工农乡最初也是采用这种办法，但在人口调查、选民登记时感到工作不方便，改以七、八个院坝、百来户划一个选区，每个选区产生二至三个代表；全乡原有六十九个居民小组，改划为一百六十四个选民小组。这样，进行选举活动和结合领导生产均很便利。同时，由于群众互相熟悉，也易酝酿候选人。工农乡参加选举的选民达到百分之九十一点六，是和选区与选民小组划分得合适分不开的。
    人口调查和选民登记之前，四个乡都做了宣传动员工作。人口调查和选民登记的时间和方法，各乡都注意了不耽误群众生产的原则。作法有两种。一种是全部利用晚上时间，采取以院坝为主、流动设站登记的办法，一边登记，一边审查选民资格，一边宣传，一边发选民证。另一种是在白天利用农隙时间，先调查人口，晚上审查选民资格，然后再开 村民大会统一发选民证，同时进行宣传。这两种方法，以前者较好，除以选民小组或院坝流动设站登记外，山区较远的地方，还可以约定时间前去登记，个别特殊情况辅以登门调查的办法，这样可以做得全面、确实。
    审查选民资格小组，每选区一个，一般为三到五人，其中包括本选区的工作组干部一人，治安保卫委员一人，及积极分子一至三人。审查小组不是对所有选民进行审查，而是着重审查少数人。有选举权利的选民，一边登记，一边领选民证。已经被研究确定没有选举权利的地主阶级分子及被管制的反革命分子，工作干部向他们讲明不发选民证的道理。问题比较复杂的只有少数地主家庭子女、媳妇和未加管制的反革命分子。对这些人，当时如不能决定，说明须待选举委员会审查确定；并告诉他们，如有意见，可向选举委员会提出。
        选举工作和反官僚主义、反强迫命令、反违法乱纪的斗争结合起来，在候选人提名这一阶段是
    主要环节。四个乡的经验证明，只有结合反官僚主义斗争、搞好干部和群众的关系，才能够很好地提出候选人。这个问题解决得好的地方，提候选人就顺利；选举委员会提出的候选人名单，群众也拥护；群众提出的意见，也多属希望代表候选人今后如何搞好工作，改正缺点等。这个问题解决得不好的地方，在提候选人中，群众则有很多意见。改善干部和群众关系的作法，四个乡一般都是先召开骨干分子会议（党员、团员、主要干部和积极分子），详细交代政策，肯定成绩，安定情绪，动员他们自觉地、主动地检讨自己的缺点。然后，分清问题的性质，该由上级负责的就由上级或工作队代表作检讨；该由干部自己负责的，耐心教育他们认识造成错误的根源，并指出今后改进的方向。干部进行检讨，一般只在代表性的会议上进行，并着重检查有关领导问题；而且要事先教育群众全盘考查干部，避免形成斗争局面。四个乡解决好干部和群众关系后，绝大部分干部仍为群众所爱戴，并被提为代表候选人。
    代表候选人提名的方法，四个乡有两种。一种是先由党、团支部、各人民团体联合协商提出候选人，把名单交给群众讨论酝酿，广泛吸收意见，大多数群众不满意的就去掉，补充新提出来的。这样酝酿较成熟后才正式公布初次的候选人名单，再经过群众二十天的慎重酝酿，于举行选举大会前五天向选民公布代表候选人的正式名单。遂宁县玉峰乡部分选区这样做的结果，候选人的提名比较集中，群众也认为选举委员会尊重大家的意见。另一种是单纯从下而上地提，提名很多，群众酝酿讨论很吃力，意见难得一致，投票不集中。这种作法，有的是因为事前准备工作做得不够；但主要是因为某些干部有旧民主主义思想的残余，认为这样才是民主，实际上反而影响真正民主的发扬。
    四个乡的经验证明，选举大会开得好坏，是和整个普选工作过程中一系列的宣传教育组织等工作分不开的；同时会前的各种准备工作和会中的掌握也很重要。内江县工农乡作得较好，经验是：一、选举日期选择了周围不是赶场的日子，不是生产最忙的日子。二、注意了发动妇女的工作：通过男子发动妇女（减少阻碍），通过妇女积极分子教育妇女
    （破除封建思想），使群众认识到妇女参政的重要。三、解决群众参加大会的具体困难。如组织大孩子看门、做杂活、带小孩等，并组织了十八岁以下的青年团员和武装队员，在开会时维持治安，使大家在会议期间更加安心。四、选举大会前一日再通知选民要按时到会。该乡各选区的选举大会一般都开得很好，选民参加选举的比例最高达到百分之九十三点六，最低的也达到百分之八十八。但温江县和盛乡召开选举大会的准备工作作得很差，会前领导干部认为召开选举大会不过是“万事俱备，只欠东风”，没有很好地研究选区过大、群众参加大会的困难；也没有慎重考虑当时群众栽秧和沤麻的紧张生产情况；同时整个乡又采取“全面开花”的办法，以致选民到得较少。根据江津县双龙乡两路口选区选举后的实际调查，只要工作做得好，发挥了群众的政治积极性，是可以争取参加选举的选民达到很高比例的。该选区共有选民四百八十二人，这次参加投票的只有三百二十人。没有到会的共一百六十二人，其中包括在附近公路旁作小商的五十八人；在街上摆摊子或在家喂猪的四十人（主要是妇女）；到附近赶场的十五人；耳聋、眼瞎、生病、生小孩、因家里死了人没空来的共十二人；出外看亲戚的十二人；此外还有到外村教书的以及到学校念书的、留在机关里值班的等等；真正无故不参加投票的，全选区只有一个选民。这些没有到会的选民，除了生病、生小孩等等情况的二十六人以外，如果会前作好宣传教育、组织等工作，开会的时间安排得恰当，是可以来参加开会的。
    目前，除和盛乡外，其他三个乡均已召开了第一次乡人民代表大会。在这次大会上都着重解决了当地群众迫切需要解决的一两个主要问题，特别是当前的生产问题和克服“五多”现象。遂宁县玉峰乡着重解决该乡当前抗旱、保水、保苗的一些问题。会上并选举了乡长和政府委员，整顿了乡的各种组织，并订出了各种切实可行的制度。乡长、文书不兼职，其他委员均兼任有关委员会的主任委员，按地区分工，帮助推动各村工作。在档案制度上，决定改变过去的混乱情况，严格控制表报填写。又确定按自然村的范围，互推代表主任一人，负责联系代表，贯彻决议，推动工作，克服了农村中的“五多”现象。其他乡也解决了类似的问题，巩固了普选工作的成绩。
