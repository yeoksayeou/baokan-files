    Tianjin Private Factory Workers Strengthen Labor Discipline and Achieve Results
    [Our Newspaper News] The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions and the trade unions of various districts, based on the instructions of Comrade Huang Huoqing, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, regarding the current work in private enterprises, have conducted a widespread education among workers in private enterprises throughout the city on improving quality, reducing costs, and strengthening labor discipline, achieving significant results.
    Since Comrade Huang Huoqing delivered the "Report on Current Work in Private Enterprises" at the cadre meeting for private enterprise work on April 26th, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions has convened two meetings of cadres from major private factories and district trade unions to convey Comrade Huang Huoqing's report. Subsequently, worker meetings were held, with large factories acting as units and small factories grouped by district, to conduct in-depth mobilization based on the workers' ideological situations. The Fifth District Trade Union alone convened more than forty meetings, and the Second District Trade Union convened more than twenty. The trade unions of various districts and major factories then mobilized the worker masses to launch group discussions, examine each individual's adherence to labor discipline, and further enhance their political awareness. At the meeting, the Seventh District Trade Union commended the workers of Tiansheng Weaving Factory, who consistently adhered to labor discipline, and the Wang Shichen group of Huada Wire Drawing Factory, whose attendance rate reached 100% for four consecutive months. At the same time, they criticized a few workers in certain factories who did not abide by labor discipline. Many factory workers were educated and further recognized the significance of the "developing production, mutual benefit for labor and capital" policy; the attendance rate of each factory generally increased compared to before. Some factories with poor labor discipline in the past, such as Hualong Zengji Dyeing Factory and Beiyang Yarn Factory in the First District, have undergone significant changes after this labor discipline education. The situation of workers not adhering to labor discipline has improved, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production.
    Because the trade union cadres and workers of each factory criticized the mistake of "emphasizing quantity over quality," the rate of defective and substandard products has been reduced compared to before. The product quality of various factories in the weaving, dyeing, machine casting, and electrical equipment industries has generally improved. According to a survey of twenty private factories in the Seventh District, the product quality of sixteen of them has improved compared to before. The workers of the North China Enamel Factory in the Second District, by studying technology, stipulated the quantitative standards for sticking fire and porcelain glaze, and improved the method of drawing patterns; they also assisted and urged the capitalists to change the formula that had been followed for more than twenty years, and improved the porcelain quality, so that the products did not crack, bubble, or develop black spots. The first-class rate of porcelain basins increased from 50% in the past to 80%; the first-class rate of porcelain cups increased from 20% in the past to 90%.
    In order to assist the capitalists in improving business management, the workers of some factories have also begun to establish production responsibility systems and revise group pacts to ensure the improvement of product quality, reduce waste, and strengthen workers' labor discipline. Currently, sixteen factories in the Second District have established a responsibility system. For example, Tongyihe Thread Factory made symbols on the spindles and dyed the bobbins with different colors in order to distinguish the production responsibility of each worker, to count the product quality of each worker, and to strengthen mutual supervision and inspection, thus greatly reducing broken ends and defective products.
    Many trade union cadres have further improved their ideological understanding and improved their work style through carrying out labor discipline education work. For example, after receiving labor discipline education, the trade union cadres of Hualun Weaving Factory took the lead in observing labor discipline, improving production, and strengthening ties with the worker masses with practical actions. Under the leadership of the trade union cadres, the factory has increased the first-class rate from 87% to 97%.
    Currently, some factories that have already conducted labor discipline education need to continue to go deeper and strengthen group work; and labor discipline education should be implemented among employees and technical personnel; especially in some small factories, this education has been done poorly and should be made up.

### 天津私营工厂职工加强劳动纪律有了成绩

    天津私营工厂职工加强劳动纪律有了成绩
    【本报讯】天津市总工会及各区工会，根据中共天津市委书记黄火青同志对目前私营企业工作的指示，对全市私营企业中的职工，普遍进行了一次关于提高质量，降低成本和加强劳动纪律的教育，取得了很大成绩。
    自黄火青同志于四月二十六日在私营企业工作干部大会上作了“关于目前私营企业工作的报告”以后，天津市总工会召开了两次各私营大厂和各区工会干部大会，传达了黄火青同志的报告。随后，以大厂为单位，小厂则按区分片分别召开职工大会，结合职工们的思想情况，作了深入的传达动员。仅五区工会就召开了四十多个会，二区工会召开了二十多个会。各区和各大厂工会接着发动职工群众展开了小组讨论，检查各人遵守劳动纪律的情况，进一步提高了政治觉悟。七区工会在大会上并表扬了遵守劳动纪律一贯较好的天生织布厂职工，和连续四个月出勤率达到百分之百的华大拔丝厂王士臣小组，同时对某些工厂少数不遵守劳动纪律的职工，则提出了批评。许多工厂的职工受到了教育，进一步认识了“发展生产、劳资两利”政策的意义；各厂出勤率普遍较前提高。原来少数劳动纪律不好的工厂，如一区华龙增记织染厂、北洋纱厂等，经过这次劳动纪律教育，情况有了很大转变，工人上班不守劳动纪律的情形也有改进，生产上出现了新气象。
    由于各厂工会干部和职工批判了“重量不重质”的错误，已使残、次品率较前降低。织染、机器铸铁、电工器材等业中各厂的产品质量，一般都有提高。据七区调查的二十户私营工厂中，有十六户的产品质量较前提高。二区华北搪瓷厂的职工们，由于钻研技术，规定了粘火和瓷青定量，改进了描花方法；并协助督促资方改变了沿袭二十多年的配方，改进了瓷质，使产品不出纹、不起泡、不出黑点，瓷盆的一等品由过去的百分之五十，提高到百分之八十；瓷杯的一等品由过去的百分之二十提高到百分之九十。
    为了协助资方改进经营管理，部分工厂的职工并开始建立了生产责任制和修订小组公约，以保证产品质量的提高，减少浪费和加强工人劳动纪律。目前，二区已有十六个工厂建立了责任制。如同义合线厂在线轴上制作了符号，在纱管上染上了不同的颜色，以便分清每个工人的生产责任，统计每个工人的产品质量，加强了彼此间的督促检查，因而断头残品大为减少。
    许多工会干部通过进行劳动纪律教育工作，思想认识也进一步提高，并改进了工作作风。如华纶织布厂的工会干部受到劳动纪律的教育后，以实际行动，带头遵守劳动纪律，提高生产，加强与职工群众的联系。该厂在工会干部的带动下，已将一等品由百分之八十七提高到百分之九十七。
    目前，有些已经进行过关于加强劳动纪律教育的工厂，还需要继续深入一步，加强小组工作；并应在职员和技术人员中贯彻劳动纪律的教育；特别是部分小型工厂，这一教育作的较差，应补上一课。
