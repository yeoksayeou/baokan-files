Decision of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government
On Strengthening Production Internships for Students in Universities and Technical Secondary Schools
(Passed at the 180th meeting of the State Administration Council on May 29, 1953)
(Promulgated on July 31, 1953)

Production internship in universities and technical secondary schools is an important method to closely link students' theoretical knowledge with practice and to integrate learning with application. In the past two years, some universities and technical secondary schools have implemented production internships for students and have gained certain experiences and achievements, which have played a positive role in improving teaching standards. However, many responsible personnel of schools and receiving institutions and enterprises do not sufficiently recognize the importance of production internships and do not pay enough attention to students' production internships, so that some school staff and students have failed to do the necessary preparatory work conscientiously beforehand, the goals of the internships are not clear, the internship plans are not comprehensive, and the personnel sent to lead the internships are not capable, thus making the production internships less effective; also, some institutions and enterprises that receive production interns have failed to recognize that as long as internships are properly organized, it will not only not hinder their own production and work tasks, but also help complete production and work tasks, and therefore have failed to give the interns the guidance and assistance they deserve according to the needs of the state for cultivating talent, which has also affected the effectiveness of the internship work. In addition, the lack of necessary systems and measures related to production internships in the past has resulted in many specific problems that need to be solved not being solved in a timely manner. In order to improve the above shortcomings, first of all, the responsible personnel of all relevant schools, institutions and enterprises are required to clearly recognize the important significance of production internships for students in universities and technical secondary schools in cultivating talent for national construction, and must carry out necessary ideological education work related to production internships among their subordinates and give it due attention. Secondly, it is also necessary to vigorously strengthen the organization of production internships. In addition to instructing the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government to formulate "Provisional Regulations on Production Internships for Students in Universities and Technical Secondary Schools" in accordance with the spirit of this decision, the following decisions are hereby made:

(1) Production internships for students in universities and technical secondary schools should be strictly based on the needs of teaching and the actual possibilities of the receiving institutions and enterprises, and should be arranged in a focused, practical, and effective manner as far as possible without affecting the completion of the production tasks of factories and mines. Relevant business departments should provide factories, mines, and institutions with better production and working conditions as internship targets for students as much as possible to ensure the quality of production internships.

(2) In order to unify the leadership of production internships for students in universities and technical secondary schools, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government and the higher education management organs in major administrative regions should form central production internship guidance committees and major administrative region production internship guidance committees respectively, together with representatives of financial and other relevant business departments, the Communist Youth League, trade unions, and relevant schools. Under the auspices of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government and the higher education management organs in major administrative regions, the committees should be responsible for formulating national and regional production internship plans, and guiding production internship matters for students in universities and technical secondary schools, in accordance with this decision and the relevant regulations or instructions issued by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government.

Each relevant school must establish a special management organization or special management personnel, under the leadership of the president and the academic dean (or director of studies), to be responsible for organizing students to conduct production internships. The directors of relevant departments and teaching research and guidance groups should personally go to the internship site to arrange and guide the internships of staff and students. Each institution or enterprise receiving interns should also, according to the needs of the work, designate certain personnel or institutions to cooperate with the personnel sent by the school to lead the internship and guide the relevant work of the internship.

(3) During the internship period, interns should be subject to the leadership of the institution or enterprise where they are interning. The leaders sent by the internship school should cooperate with the relevant personnel of the institution or enterprise to do a good job in guiding the production internship. Before conducting production internships, each school must consult with the relevant institutions or enterprises to make thorough preparations for all aspects, and especially to conduct earnest education for interns on protecting state property, keeping state secrets, and strictly observing work rules and labor discipline. After the interns arrive at the internship site, the institution or enterprise should, according to the specific situation, organize the interns to study the rules and regulations related to confidentiality, security, labor protection, and labor discipline, and read relevant internship materials and documents. Under the leadership of the institution or enterprise where they are located, the interns should strictly organize the internship, strictly observe work discipline, humbly and conscientiously study, and promptly check and improve their work to ensure the completion of the production internship plan and avoid affecting production or causing other accidents.

(4) During the production internship, the expenses for travel, food, internship subsidies, transportation, and rewards and subsidies for technical guidance personnel dispatched by the institution or enterprise shall be borne by the school that sends the interns. The labor tools, test materials, special labor protection products, and the expenses for using the houses, water, and electricity of the institution or enterprise required for the internship shall be assisted by the institution or enterprise where the internship is conducted. The institutions or enterprises accepting production interns should also appropriately provide the necessary information for the interns' internship and assist the school in solving the interns' food and accommodation problems.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于加强高等学校与中等技术学校学生生产实习工作的决定
    （一九五三年五月二十九日政务院第一百八十次政务会议通过）
    （一九五三年七月三十一日公布）
    高等学校和中等技术学校的生产实习是使学生的理论知识密切联系实际并使学用一致的重要方法之一。两年来，一部分高等学校和中等技术学校的学生已实行了生产实习，并取得了一定的经验和成绩，对提高教学水平起了积极的作用。但还有不少学校和接受实习的机关与企业的负责人员，对生产实习的重要性认识不足，对学生的生产实习重视不够，以致有些学校员生事先未能认真做好必要的准备工作，实习的目标不明确，实习的计划不周密，派去领导实习的人员不得力，因而使生产实习收效不大；也有些接受生产实习的机关和企业未能认识到只要妥善地组织实习，不仅不妨碍自己完成生产与工作任务，而且有助于生产和工作任务的完成，因而未能按照国家培养建设人才的需要给予实习员生以应有的指导和帮助，这也影响了实习工作的效果。兼以过去缺乏有关生产实习的各项必要的制度和办法，致使许多需要解决的具体问题尚未及时解决。为改进上述缺点，首先要求各有关学校和机关企业的负责人员，明确认识高等学校和中等技术学校学生进行生产实习对培养国家建设人才的重要意义，并须对所属人员进行必要的有关生产实习的思想教育工作，予以应有的重视。其次，还必须大力加强生产实习的组织工作，除责成中央人民政府高等教育部根据本决定的精神制订“高等学校与中等技术学校学生生产实习暂行规程”外，特作如下决定：
    （一）高等学校和中等技术学校学生的生产实习，应严格根据教学的必要和接受实习的机关与企业的实际可能，尽可能在不影响厂矿生产任务完成的条件下，作有重点的切实有效的布置。各有关业务部门应尽可能提供生产与工作情况较好的厂矿和机关作为学生实习的对象，以保证生产实习的质量。
    （二）为统一高等学校及中等技术学校学生生产实习的领导，中央人民政府高等教育部及各大行政区的高等教育管理机关，应与财经及其它有关业务部门、青年团、工会等组织的代表以及有关学校的代表，分别组成中央生产实习指导委员会和大行政区的生产实习指导委员会。该委员会应在中央人民政府高等教育部和大行政区高等教育管理机关主持下，按照本决定及中央人民政府高等教育部发布的有关规程或指示，负责制订全国范围的及各地区的生产实习计划，指导各高等学校及中等技术学校学生的生产实习事宜。
    各有关学校必须设专管机构或专管人员，在校长和教务长（或教务主任）领导下，负责组织学生进行生产实习。有关的系科和教学研究指导组主任应亲自到实习现场布置和指导员生的实习。各接受实习的机关或企业，也应根据工作的需要，指定一定人员或机构，与学校派去领导实习的人员协同指导有关实习的各项工作。
    （三）实习员生在实习期内应受实习所在的机关或企业的领导。实习学校所派出的领导人员应与该机关或企业的有关人员协力合作，作好指导生产实习的工作。各校在进行生产实习之前，必须商同有关机关或企业切实作好各项准备工作，尤须对实习员生认真进行爱护国家财产、保守国家机密及严格遵守工作制度与劳动纪律的教育。实习员生到达实习场所后，所在机关或企业应根据具体情况，组织实习员生学习有关保密、保安、劳动保护及劳动纪律的规章制度，阅读有关实习工作的资料和文件。实习员生应在所在的机关或企业的领导下，严密实习组织，严格工作纪律，虚心认真学习，及时检查和改进自己的工作，以保证生产实习计划的完成，并避免影响生产及发生其他事故。
    （四）在进行生产实习期间，实习员生所需的旅费、伙食费、实习补助费、交通费及所在机关或企业派出之技术指导人员的酬劳补助费等，统由派出实习员生的学校负担。实习所需的劳动工具、试料、特殊劳动保护品及使用所在机关、企业的房屋、水电等所需用费，统由实习所在的机关或企业协助解决。接受生产实习的机关或企业并应适当供给为该实习员生实习中所必需的资料及协助学校解决实习员生的伙食、住宿问题。
