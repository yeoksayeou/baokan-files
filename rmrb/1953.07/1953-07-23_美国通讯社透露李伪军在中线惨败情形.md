Xinhua News Agency report:

    On the 15th, the Associated Press described the situation on the central Korean front: "Today, along the 20-mile stretch of barren mountainous front, the largest battle in the two years of the Korean War is taking place. The Chinese army is routing division after division of the South Korean army and breaking into the South Korean lines, forcing four South Korean divisions to retreat along the Kimhwa salient area in the eastern part of the central front." "The Observation Post has been lost, Finger Hill is almost lost, and other unnamed high ground has also fallen under the fierce attack of the Chinese army." "The South Korean divisions have been severely battered."

    Since then, the fierce fighting has continued on the front lines, and the dire defeat of the Li pseudo-army has continued to be revealed in reports from American news agencies.

    Countless reports from American news agencies, like the aforementioned Associated Press report, admitted that after the Chinese and Korean People's Army launched a counterattack, the Li pseudo-army was immediately routed like stray dogs. International News Service wrote: "Communist infantry emerged from countless small valleys, encircling and attacking cut-off units. Other South Korean units suffered heavy casualties in the frontal and rear attacks of the Communist army." The pseudo-army's Gyeonggi Division, known as the "elite of the Korean army" and the "honor of the South Korean army," was badly battered. According to the Associated Press: "The deputy division commander and a regimental commander of the division are missing in action. In one of the regiments that was defeated, it is believed that no battalion commander is still alive."

    After being severely battered, the Li pseudo-army began a hasty retreat across the entire front. Associated Press reporter Edwards said: "It was originally estimated that the Korean army would blow up the bridges across the Kumhwa River and establish defensive positions on the high ground to the south. However, the Korean army did not destroy the bridges and did not stop south of Kumhwa, leaving many bridges intact and continuing to retreat south." Those fleeing pseudo-army soldiers were "some sitting on trucks and jeeps, some clinging to tanks, and some riding on the gun barrels of artillery. However, there were still thousands of people walking south on foot with their canvas-soled, blistered feet. These people hobbled forward, collapsing on the muddy roadside when they were exhausted, regardless of the torrential rain." After "most of the Korean army's initial retreat, two regiments of the Korean army on the eastern flank south of Kumhwa suddenly retreated another three miles, although they were not under pressure from the Chinese army." Therefore, "the division commander was replaced."

    The Li Seung-man pseudo-army painstakingly underwent "re-deployment, re-organization, and replenishment" and began a counterattack. Taylor, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, repeatedly went to the front lines to supervise the battle, and Clark also flew from Tokyo to inspect the front lines. Li Seung-man, deeply "uneasy" about the South Korean army "being eliminated so much," not only sent telegrams to the pseudo-army officers and soldiers, urging them to "defend to the death" and "encourage them to make greater efforts," but also went to the front lines himself once. However, the pseudo-army's counterattack was still very unsuccessful. United Press said: "The Korean army's counterattack met the enemy's main force and therefore could not advance." Not only that, but the Chinese and Korean People's Army repeatedly used counterattacks to strike the pseudo-army's counterattacks. On the 18th, United Press reporter Wilmilen wrote: "The Communist army's attack today frustrated three divisions of the South Korean army advancing north on the central front." On the 19th, United Press wrote again: "The Chinese army broke through the Allied lines in two places," causing the Li pseudo-army to "suffer the biggest blow in three days." On the 20th, Wilmilen wrote again: The Communist army "frustrated the South Korean army's advance north."

    The Li Seung-man pseudo-army's counterattack only greatly increased their casualties. A United Press reporter wrote: "The lines of ambulances seemed endless," "Some ambulances looked like large buses, filled with stretchers. Every seat was occupied." International News Service reporter Dennis quoted the chief medical officer of a Li pseudo-army hospital as saying: "Everywhere is filled with patients, even the office area of this hospital tent is occupied by patients. The hospital only has 300 beds, but one day it admitted 1,300 wounded soldiers. A thousand people had no beds and slept on stretchers. There were not enough ambulances to transport all these wounded soldiers, and they were crammed uncomfortably into trucks."

    The American aggressor troops supporting the Li pseudo-army's operations were also severely battered in the fighting. Associated Press reporter Gibson reported the demise of an American artillery battalion, saying: "It was about 2:05 AM. The night was pitch black. Clouds covered the stars. The gunners were sweating in the rain. Then, in the pauses between the artillery fire, one soldier perked up his ears, and the rest also listened intently. The Chinese army's bugle calls—were coming from the front, right, and left. The silence was terrifying—suddenly broken by the lieutenant's scream. Direct fire! Fire at will! The Chinese are coming. They are rushing towards us. They broke through the perimeter and rushed towards the artillery positions, jumping into the artillery fortifications and wrestling with the gunners there. The enemy swarmed into the battalion headquarters command post. By 2:47 AM—forty-two minutes after hearing the bugle calls—it was all over. The survivors returned, bringing back only five cannons. They were exhausted and weak to death. In this battle-hardened field artillery battalion, at least three hundred Americans were killed or went missing."

    International News Service reported the miserable condition of four soldiers from "an American mortar unit that was encircled and annihilated by Chinese forces on June 14th, and then encircled and annihilated again a month later." The news wrote: "Four exhausted American soldiers, with fear still evident on their sweat- and dust-covered faces. For these tired soldiers who had seen death and prayed that Yama, the King of Hell, would not find them, this battle was a terrifying fight that made their souls fly to the ninth heaven. They were squatting in knee-deep water under a small wooden bridge when Chinese mortars hit the gully; only two hundred feet away from them. Private First Class Hean cursed the war loudly. He cursed: 'Damn it, I can't take it anymore. We have to run away twice in a month, and now we have to suffer this. How can anyone stand it? If we can escape this war with our lives, we should thank God.' They talked in detail about the annihilation of the unit and their escape for their lives, 'crawling along the base of walls'."

    Many reports from American news agencies talk about the near-death experiences of those American "advisors" and other American soldiers in the Li pseudo-army. Their situation was equally miserable. American soldiers longed for a ceasefire to be realized. A United Press dispatch on the 20th wrote: "Seven days of fighting on the Kumhwa River have exhausted and disgusted the soldiers, and they are unwilling to let go of any hope." A weary soldier named Williams said quietly, "I hope we can sign a truce agreement this time." Corporal Hecht, 22, asked skeptically, "Li Seung-man has agreed to a truce, right?" He said: "If the war is over, I will be the happiest person in the world."

### 美国通讯社透露李伪军在中线惨败情形

    美国通讯社透露李伪军在中线惨败情形
    据新华社讯：十五日，美联社描写朝鲜中线的战况说：“今天沿着二十英里的荒山的前线，进行着两年来朝鲜战争中最大的一场战斗。中国军把南朝鲜军一师又一师地击溃而冲入南朝鲜阵线，迫使韩国四个师沿着中线东部金城突出地带后撤。”“守望山已经失守，指头岭差不多等于失守了，其他无名高地也都在中国军队猛攻下失陷。”“南朝鲜师受到痛击。”
    在此之后，激烈的战争在前线继续进行，关于李伪军遭受惨败的情形，从美国通讯社的报道中也继续不断地透露出来。
    美国通讯社的无数消息像前引美联社消息一样，承认在朝中人民军队发起反击之后，李伪军立即被打得如丧家之犬。国际新闻社写道：“共军步兵从无数小山谷里冲出来，包抄和袭击被断绝的部队。其他的南朝鲜部队在共军的正面和背后的攻击中遭受重创。”被称为“韩军的精锐”、“南朝鲜军的荣誉”的伪军京畿师，被打得头破血流。据美联社说：该师“副师长和一个团长在作战中失踪了。在被打垮的一个团里，相信没有一个营长还活着”。
    李伪军在遭到痛击后全线慌慌张张地开始大溃退。美联社记者爱德华兹说：“原先估计韩军要炸毁横贯金城川的桥梁，而在南面的高地上建立防御阵地。但是，韩军没有击毁桥梁，也没有在金城以南停下来，他们让许多桥梁留存着，不断向南退去。”那些狼狈万状的伪军士兵，“有的坐着卡车和吉普，有的攀在坦克上，有的骑在大炮的炮身上。但是，还有成千的人用那穿着帆布胶底鞋而且起了水泡的一双脚向南步行。这些人一拐一拐地向前走，到了精疲力竭的时候在路旁的泥地里倒头就睡，顾不得倾盆大雨了”。在“大部分韩军最初撤退以后两天，已经退到金城以南的东翼上的两团韩军又突然后退三英里，虽然并未受到中国军队的压力”。因此，
    “该师师长被撤换”。
    李承晚伪军费尽力气，经过“重新部署、重新整顿与补充”，开始反扑。美国第八军军长泰勒一再前往前线督战，克拉克也特地从东京飞往前线视察。为南朝鲜军“被消灭那么多”而深感“不安”的李承晚，不仅打电报给伪军官兵，要他们“死守”，“鼓励他们作更大的努力”；而且还亲自跑到前线去了一次。但是，伪军的反扑仍旧很不顺利。合众社说：“韩军的反击遇到敌人的主力，因此反攻不动”。不仅如此，朝中人民军队并一再以反击来打击伪军的反扑。十八日，合众社记者威尔米伦写道：“中共军的攻击，今天挫折了在中线向北推进的三师南朝鲜军队。”十九日，合众社又写道：“中国军队突破联军防线两处”，使李伪军“遭到三日来最大一次打击”。二十日，威尔米伦又写道：共军“挫折了南朝鲜军的向北推进”。
    李承晚伪军的反扑只是使他们的伤亡大大增加。合众社记者写道：“救护车的行列像是没有完的”，
    “有些救护车看起来像是大公共汽车，它们上面排满了担架。每个位子上都有人。”国际新闻社记者杰尼斯引述李伪军一个伤兵医院的军医主任的话说：
    “到处都被病人占满了，甚至这个医院帐篷的办公的地方也被病人占用。医院里只有三百张床位，但是有一天却收容了一千三百个伤兵。有一千人没有床位，就睡在担架上。没有足够的救护车来运送所有这些伤兵，他们是被很不舒服地硬塞在卡车里。”
    支援李伪军作战的美国侵略军在战斗中也受到痛击。美联社记者吉布逊报道一个美军炮兵营覆没的情形说：“约在上午二时零五分。夜是黑漆漆的。云层遮盖了星星。炮手们在雨中流着汗。然后，在炮声的间歇里，一个兵士竖起了耳朵，其余兵士也都侧耳倾听，中国军的号角声——前面、右面、左面都是。一时寂静得可怕——突然被中尉的尖叫声打破了。向前直射！随便射击！中国兵来了。他们向着我们冲来。他们冲破了外围，向大炮阵地冲来，他们跳进大炮的垣墙，和那边的炮手们扭成一团。敌人蜂涌冲入营部指挥所。到上午二时四十七分——听到号角声以后四十二分钟——一切都完了。死里逃生的人回来，只带回五门炮。他们疲惫不堪，衰弱得要死。他们这个久经战斗的野战炮兵营里，至少有三百个美国人被打死或者失了踪。”
    国际新闻社记者报道了“被中国部队在六月十四日围歼一个月后又再度被围歼的一个美国迫击炮部队”中的四个士兵的狼狈相。消息写道：“四个精疲力竭的美国士兵，满是汗渍和尘土的脸上恐惧神态还没有消失。对于这些看到死亡，心中祈祷着阎罗王不要找到他们的疲惫的兵士来说，这场仗简直是令人魂飞九霄的恐怖战斗。他们躲在一座小木桥下面深到膝盖的水里蹲着，这时中国的迫击炮打到山沟里；离他们只有二百英尺。一等兵赫安大声咒骂这个战争。他骂道：‘妈的，真受不了。一个月里我们要逃跑两次，现在还得受这个罪，叫人怎样吃得消。这样下去能在这个战争中逃出一条命来，就该谢天谢地。’他们几个详细地谈到部队被歼和他们‘在墙脚下爬行’逃命的经过。”
    美国通讯社的很多消息谈到那些李伪军中的美国
    “顾问”和其他美军士兵死里逃生的经历。他们的情形也同样地狼狈。美军士兵渴望停战实现。合众社二十日电写道：“金城川上的七天的战斗，使战士们精疲力尽，感到厌恶，对任何希望都不肯放过。”一个疲乏不堪的兵士威廉斯悄悄地说：“我希望我们这次能够签订停战协定。”二十二岁的下士赫却特怀疑地问道：“李承晚已经同意停战，是吗？”他说：“如果战争结束了，我就要成为世界上最愉快的人。”
