Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: As the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France hold meetings in Washington, the contradictions between the United States and Britain on the Middle East issue have become more apparent.

Since the date of the three foreign ministers' meeting was set, the British side has indicated that it would ask the United States to explain some of its recent actions in the Middle East. United Press reported on the 9th that before the British Acting Foreign Secretary Salisbury went to Washington, Churchill had instructed him on the Middle East issue, explaining that "the old man (Churchill) is angry" because Dulles, after making a "fact-finding trip," had apparently changed his view on the Suez Canal Zone issue, shifting from a policy of "more or less promising to support Britain" to "favoring Egypt's position," requiring Britain to withdraw unconditionally before discussing defense issues.

On the eve of the three foreign ministers' meeting, the infighting between the United States and Britain over the Middle East issue was actually quite intense. At the same time that Britain stopped supplying the Egyptian government with arms, the United States, in order to step up its military control over Middle Eastern countries, proposed providing military "aid" to Arab governments, sending American military delegations to reside in the countries receiving "aid" to train troops and supervise the use of weapons. This matter aroused great dissatisfaction in Britain. Reuters reported on the 8th that Britain had protested to the US government about the US supply of arms to Egypt. At the same time, Britain fabricated the incident of a missing British pilot in the Suez Canal Zone on the 9th, putting the local situation in a state of tension. According to United Press, Egyptian officials in Washington told US Assistant Secretary of State Byroade that they believed the incident was an "excuse" used by Britain to "obstruct Secretary of State Dulles's efforts to resolve this thorny Suez issue."

During the three foreign ministers' meeting, the United States and Britain held two secret meetings specifically on the Middle East issue. However, the fact that no communique was issued on the Middle East issue after the meeting showed that the contradictions between the United States and Britain on the Middle East had not been resolved. United Press reported on the 15th, quoting "authoritative British sources," acknowledging that it was no easier for the United States and Britain to reach a consensus on the Egyptian issue than it was for them to reach a consensus on the Far East and European issues. "What seems certain is that the United States is still putting pressure on Britain to agree to some form of compromise, which would be contrary to Britain's understanding of the situation in the Middle East."

Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: TASS, Cairo: According to newspaper reports, Egypt sent a note to Britain on the 15th to protest against the actions of the British military authorities in Ismailia. At the same time, due to the current tense relations between Britain and Egypt, diplomatic activities in Cairo remain frequent. The British Chargé d'Affaires in Egypt, Hankey, held talks with US Ambassador Caffery on the morning of the 15th, and then visited the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fawzi. Fawzi also met with Caffery on the evening of the 15th.

According to newspaper reports, a British soldier who escaped from a British barracks in the Suez Canal Zone requested asylum from the Egyptian authorities in Ismailia. The soldier said he did not want to return to the barracks. However, the Egyptian authorities handed the soldier over to the British command. According to the newspaper, the Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, Salem, said that due to the current tense situation in the Suez Canal Zone, "the authorities had no other option but to return the soldier to the British authorities, as Ismailia is surrounded by British troops."

Referring to the incident of the missing British airman Leighton, which triggered the current tension, Salem said: "If the British military authorities do not cancel the current measures, Egypt will not take any measures to find Leighton." According to Al-Ahram, a representative of the British Embassy in Cairo stated that the British command would not cancel its measures unless the British airman was found.

Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Cairo: Egyptian newspapers have published comments on the British ultimatum demanding that Egypt hand over a missing British airman.

Al-Ahram's editorial on the 13th said: "We have never doubted Britain's malice towards us. Today's incident does not surprise us. For seventy years, Britain has treated us this way." The editorial concluded, "Today's Egypt is not the Egypt that Britain knows. We are not afraid of the imperialists."

Al-Akhbar pointed out on the same day that Egypt had not forgotten the events of 1882, when a Maltese man was killed in Alexandria and the British fleet bombarded the city. The newspaper said, "Egypt will repay Britain's blows with blows." The newspaper further pointed out on the 14th that the incident was deliberately fabricated by Britain, and said: "The whole world is on our side, because our reason is: 'British, why are you staying in our country? We don't want you. Get out!'"

### 美英在中东的矛盾更加露骨英埃关系紧张

    美英在中东的矛盾更加露骨英埃关系紧张
    【新华社十七日讯】随着美、英、法三国外长华盛顿会议的举行，美英在中东问题上的矛盾已更加表面化。
    自从三国外长会议的日期确定以后，英国方面就表示要在会议中要求美国解释最近时期它在中东的一些行动。合众社九日并透露，在英国代理外交大臣萨利斯柏利赴华盛顿之前，邱吉尔曾就中东问题对他有所指示，指示说明，“这个老头（邱吉尔）生气了”，因为杜勒斯在作了“调查事实旅行”之后，显然已经改变了他对苏彝士运河区问题的看法，即由“多多少少答应支持英国”的政策转变为“赞成埃及的主张”，要英国应先无条件地撤出，然后再谈防务问题。
    在三国外长会议召开的前夕，美英两国对中东问题的勾心斗角实际上已经十分剧烈。和英国停止供给埃及政府以军火的同时，美国为了加紧在军事上控制中东各国，却建议给阿拉伯各国政府军事“援助”，派遣美国军事代表团驻在接受“援助”的各国，训练军队和监督武器的使用。这件事引起英国的极大不满。路透社八日电透露，英国已因美国供应埃及军火一事，向美国政府提出抗议。与此同时，英国在九日在苏彝士运河区制造了英国飞行员失踪事件，使当地情势陷于剑拔弩张。据合众社透露，埃及驻华盛顿官员向美国助理国务卿拜娄德说，他们认为这次事件是英国用来“阻挠国务卿杜勒斯解决这棘手的苏彝士问题的努力”的“藉口”。
    在三国外长会议举行期间，美英二国特别就中东问题举行了两次秘密会议。但是，会议结束后没有就中东问题发表公报，这一事实表明，美英在中东的矛盾并没有能得到解决。合众社十五日电引“权威英国人士”的话承认，美英二国要在埃及问题上取得一致的意见，并不比它们在远东和欧洲问题上取得一致意见更容易些。“看来肯定的是，美国仍在对英国施用压力，要它同意某些方式的妥协，而这种妥协是会和英国对中东局势的了解相反的。”
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社开罗讯：据报纸报道，埃及在十五日照会英国，就伊士美利亚英军当局的行动提出抗议。同时，由于目前英埃关系紧张，开罗外交活动仍然频繁。英国驻埃及临时代办汉基在十五日上午和美国大使卡弗里商谈，接着他又访问了埃及外交部部长法齐。法齐并在十五日晚接见卡弗里。
    据报纸报道，有一个从苏彝士运河区英国兵营逃跑的英国士兵请求伊士美利亚的埃及当局给他避难的地方。这个士兵说，他不愿意回到兵营里去。然而，埃及当局把这个士兵交给了英国司令部。据报纸说，埃及国家指导部部长萨勒姆说，由于目前苏彝士运河区的紧张局势，“当局除了把这个士兵交还英国当局之外，再无其他办法，因为伊士美利亚处于英军的包围之下。”
    萨勒姆在谈到成为目前紧张局势的导火线的英国空军人员李格顿失踪事件时说：“假使英军当局不取消现行的措施，埃及就不采取找回李格顿的任何措施。”据“金字塔报”报道，英国驻开罗大使馆代表声明，除非找回英国的空军人员，否则英国司令部就不取消它的措施。
    【新华社十七日讯】开罗消息：埃及报纸对于英国提出最后通牒要求埃及交出一名失踪的英国空军人员的事件，纷纷发表评论。
    “埃及人报”十三日的社论说：“我们从来没有怀疑过英国对于我们的恶意。今天的事件并不使我们惊奇。七十年来，英国一直就是这样对待我们的。”社论的结语说，“今天的埃及已不是英国所了解的以前的埃及了。”“我们并不畏惧帝国主义者。”
    “消息报”在同一天指出：埃及还没有忘掉一八八二年的事件，当时一个马尔他岛人在亚历山大港被杀，英国舰队就炮轰那座城市。该报说，“埃及将以打击回报英国的打击”。该报接着在十四日再度指出这次事件是英国故意制造的，并说：“全世界都站在我们这一方面，因为我们的理由是：‘英国人，你们为什么要呆在我们国内？我们不要你们。滚出去吧！’”
