    The current international situation is characterized by the vigorous rise of the forces of peace and the widespread development of people's movements striving for the settlement of international disputes through negotiation. Events in recent months have convincingly demonstrated the possibility of easing international tensions and finding ways to consolidate peace and international security.

    At the same time, new evidence shows that the enemies of peace have not abandoned their sinister actions aimed at opposing the peaceful resolution of international problems. They spare no means to carry out various sinister provocations in the hope of realizing their treacherous conspiracies.

    Recently, fascist mercenaries of Western countries carried out such a provocative action in Berlin, aimed at opposing peace and international security. The organizers of the provocation adopted the methods of Nazi murderers and added the methods of American hooligans, creating riots in the democratic sector of Berlin. They committed arson and attempted to murder cadres of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, people's organizations, and state organs of the German Democratic Republic.

    Despite the extensive propaganda and distortion of the essence of the recent events in Berlin by the United States and West Germany, this propaganda cannot deceive world public opinion, nor can it conceal the true instigators of this adventure. The investigations conducted by the authorities of the German Democratic Republic have clearly revealed the truth of the matter. The intelligence agencies of the United States made long-term preparations for this adventure in Berlin. The money used for this adventure was paid from the funds appropriated by the U.S. Congress in 1951 for subversive activities against the Soviet Union and the countries of the democratic camp. The occupying authorities of Britain and France also did not stand idly by during this adventure. The provocation in Berlin was planned and carried out in collusion with the military authorities of the Western countries under the direct leadership of the reactionary rulers of Bonn, Adenauer and Kaiser, as well as the social democratic leaders Ollenhauer and Reuter.

    The reactionary groups of Western countries, the Adenauer clique and their accomplices, planned and led this adventure. Overthrowing the democratic system and establishing a fascist dictatorship in the German Democratic Republic – this is the aim of the conspiracy against the cause of peace and against German unity.

    The adventure organized by the imperialist mercenaries in Berlin – the premeditated and planned nature of which even the reactionary Western press cannot conceal – just happened to coincide with the shameless provocative actions of the puppet ruler of South Korea, Syngman Rhee. It was precisely in these days that, with the connivance of the Americans, Syngman Rhee ordered the large-scale "release" from the prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea of those prisoners who should have been handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with the agreements reached.

    Is such a coincidence between these two provocative actions accidental? Not at all. These two provocations are two links in a chain. Their purpose is the same – to prevent the forces of peace from easing international tensions and to indulge the forces of war.

    Was it accidental that the plotters and organizers of the criminal adventures in Korea and Berlin chose such a moment? Every honest person can find a clear answer to this question by recalling what happened before these two provocations took place.

    In Korea, after lengthy negotiations, an agreement was reached on the repatriation of prisoners of war. The signing of this agreement removed the last obstacle to the signing of an armistice agreement and ending the war. This agreement, which was warmly welcomed by all good people around the world, was a serious step towards easing international tensions.

    The government of the German Democratic Republic, on the advice of the Socialist Unity Party, adopted a series of important decisions and implemented a series of measures aimed at bringing the two parts of Germany closer together and greatly improving the living standards of the broad masses of the people.

    These measures were warmly welcomed by honest Germans in both East and West Germany. Democratic public opinion throughout the world justly recognized these measures as important steps towards restoring Germany's unity on a democratic basis and towards establishing a common foundation for turning Germany into a unified, independent, democratic and peace-loving country.

    Every step taken on the road to building a unified democratic Germany cannot but help to ease international tensions and to consolidate peace and security in Europe. But this is precisely what the American reactionaries and their West German allies do not want. They see this as a serious threat to their policy – the policy of launching a new war.

    The Berlin provocation organized by fascist thugs under the leadership of American officers could not but fail, and indeed it did fail. It could not but fail because it was not supported by the broad masses of the people in the democratic sector of Berlin and the German Democratic Republic. This adventure, aimed at harming the vital interests of the German people and opposing the cause of peace, has been resolutely crushed. The failure of the fascist provocation has opened the eyes of many people who were influenced by the false propaganda of the reactionaries. In the German Democratic Republic and the democratic sector of Berlin, working people are holding mass rallies and conferences, at which they resolutely condemn the fascist provocateurs and express their complete trust in the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. In response to the reactionary provocation, advanced workers are stepping up their efforts to complete and overfulfill production plans and are applying to join the Socialist Unity Party. Intellectuals, peasants, and the broad masses of the people all support the measures taken by the Party and the government.

    The enemies of peace attempted to use the Berlin provocation to obstruct the powerful movement of the German people for peace and for the democratic unity of their country. But they cannot mislead the honest workers of the German Democratic Republic. Nor can they mislead the West German patriots who resolutely resist the Bonn and Paris military treaties and oppose the Adenauer clique's anti-popular revenge policies.

    No matter what provocative actions and adventures the enemies of peace take, they will never weaken the desire of the people of the world for lasting peace. They will never shake the firm will of millions of people in all countries to fight for the great cause of peace and to persevere in this cause to the end. This determination and will of the people of all countries are clearly expressed in the recent declaration of the World Peace Council meeting on launching a worldwide movement for negotiation.

    All those who cherish the cause of peace have learned lessons and conclusions from the recent provocative actions of the reactionary forces. Relaxing vigilance against the plots and conspiracies of the enemies of peace is a criminal act of paralysis. In analyzing its own work and drawing lessons from the recent events in Berlin, the Socialist Unity Party exposed the serious mistakes it had made in the past year and made principled and merciless criticisms of these mistakes. The party is now carrying out tremendous work to correct mistakes, overcome weaknesses, raise political vigilance, and strengthen ties with the working class and the broad masses of the working people.

    At the plenary session held on June 21, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party adopted an important resolution, which made a profound analysis of the situation and set concrete tasks for the Party to strengthen mass work and resolutely implement the new policy. The Central Committee specifically recommended that Party meetings and workers' meetings should be held in various enterprises, at which cadres must "frankly and courageously answer the questions raised by workers and other staff members. We must launch a resolute struggle to defend the interests of the working class and the happiness of all working people, a struggle to explain and implement our new policies, to make honest workers understand the mistakes they have made, and a struggle against provocateurs."

    The Communist and Workers' Parties, which regard the struggle for peace as their primary task, are strengthening their ties with the masses, raising vigilance against the plots of the opposition, and tirelessly exposing the anti-popular policies and criminal conspiracies of the enemies of peace.

    The Communist and Workers' Parties – the most loyal and steadfast fighters for the vital interests of the working people, are holding higher the banner of peace, national independence and democratic freedom for all countries.

    和平的敌人在柏林的冒险行动破产了
    （“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十六期社论）
    目前国际局势的特点是和平拥护者的力量蓬勃高涨，是争取用协商方式解决国际争端的人民运动广泛展开。最近几个月以来的事件，令人信服地证明了有可能缓和国际紧张局势，有可能找出巩固和平和国际安全的途径。
    同时，新的证据表明，和平的敌人并没有放弃他们的旨在反对和平解决国际问题的罪恶行动。他们不惜采取任何手段，进行各种罪恶的挑衅，以期实现他们的奸诈阴谋。
    西方国家的法西斯雇佣分子最近在柏林就干出了这种旨在反对和平和国际安全的挑衅行动。挑衅行动的组织者采取纳粹杀人犯的方法，并加上美国流氓的方法，在柏林民主区制造骚乱，他们实行纵火并企图杀害德国统一社会党、德意志民主共和国的人民团体和国家机关的干部。
    尽管美国和西德大肆宣传，歪曲最近在柏林发生的事件的实质，但是，这种宣传并不能迷惑世界舆论，并不能把这次冒险行动的真正教唆者掩盖起来。德意志民主共和国当局所进行的调查，清清楚楚地揭示了事情的真相。美国的特务机关为柏林的这次冒险行动作了长期准备。这次冒险行动所用的钱，就是由美国国会一九五一年拨充对苏联和民主阵营国家进行颠覆活动的经费中支付的。英国和法国占领当局对于这次冒险行动也并不是袖手旁观的。柏林的挑衅行动是在波恩反动统治者阿登纳和凯撒以及社会民主党头子奥伦豪尔和鲁特的直接领导下，与西方国家军事当局串通一气，所筹划和实行的。
    策划和领导这次冒险行动的就是西方国家的反动集团、阿登纳集团及其同谋者。推翻民主制度，在德意志民主共和国建立法西斯独裁——这就是反对和平事业和反对德国统一的阴谋的目的。
    柏林的帝国主义雇佣分子所组织的冒险行动——这种冒险行动的预谋性和计划性，就连西方的反动报刊也掩饰不了——刚好是与南朝鲜的傀儡统治者李承晚的无耻挑衅行动发生在同一个时候。正是在这几天，在美国人的纵容下，李承晚下令把那些应当按照已达成的协议交与中立国委员会的战俘们，从南朝鲜的俘虏营中大批“释放”了。
    这两种挑衅行动如此巧合，难道是偶然的吗？一点也不是的。这两种挑衅是一条锁链上的两个环节。它们的目的是相同的——阻止和平力量去缓和国际紧张局势，放纵战争势力。
    朝鲜和柏林的罪恶冒险行动的策动者和组织者刚好选择了这样一个时机，难道是偶然的吗？每一个正直的人只要回忆一下在这两种挑衅行动发生以前的事情，就可以找到这个问题的清楚的答案。
    在朝鲜，经过了长时间的谈判，达成了遣返战俘的协议。这个协议的签订，为签订停战协定和结束战争扫除了最后的障碍。这个受到全世界善良人们热烈欢迎的协议是认真地向着缓和国际紧张局势走了一步的。
    德意志民主共和国政府根据统一社会党的建议，通过了一系列的重要决定，并实行了一系列的旨在使德国东西两部分接近并大大提高广大人民阶层的生活水平的措施。
    这些措施受到了东德和西德正直的德国人民的热烈欢迎。全世界的民主舆论都公正地认定这些措施是为了在民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，为了把德国变成一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的国家而建立共同基础的重要步骤。
    在建立统一的民主德国的道路上所采取的每一步骤，都不能不有助于缓和国际的紧张局势，有助于巩固欧洲的和平与安全。但是，这正是美国的反动分子和他们的西德盟友所不要的。他们认为这对于他们的政策——发动新战争的政策——是一个严重的威胁。
    法西斯暴徒在美国军官的领导下所组织的柏林挑衅行动是不能不失败的，而且也的确失败了。它之所以不能不失败，是因为柏林民主区和德意志民主共和国的广大人民阶层都不支持它。这种旨在损害德国人民切身利益、反对和平事业的冒险行动，已经被坚决地粉碎了。法西斯挑衅行动的失败，使许多受反动派虚伪宣传的影响的人睁开了眼睛。在德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区，劳动人民正在举行群众集会和大会，他们在会上坚决斥责法西斯挑衅者，并表示他们完全信任德意志民主共和国政府和德国统一社会党。为了回答反动派的挑衅行动，先进的工人们正在加紧努力完成并超额完成生产计划，并申请加入统一社会党。知识分子、农民和广大人民群众都拥护党和政府所采取的措施。
    和平的敌人企图利用柏林的挑衅行动来阻挠德国人民争取和平和争取自己祖国的民主统一的强大运动。但他们并不能使德意志民主共和国正直的工人们走入歧途。他们也不能使坚决反抗波恩和巴黎军事条约、反对阿登纳集团反人民的复仇政策的西德爱国人士走入歧途。
    不管和平的敌人采取怎样的挑衅行动和冒险行动，他们决计削弱不了全世界人民要求持久和平的愿望。他们决计动摇不了各国千百万人士为伟大的和平事业而奋斗，并把这一事业坚持到底的坚定意志。各国人民这种决心，这种意志，在最近世界和平理事会会议关于发动一个争取协商的世界运动的宣言上，清楚地表示出来了。
    凡是珍贵和平事业的人都从反动势力最近的挑衅行动中得到了教训和结论。对于和平的敌人的阴谋诡计放松警惕，就是一种犯罪性的麻痹行为。统一社会党在分析自己的工作，并从最近的柏林事件中取得教训时，揭露了它过去一年来所犯的严重错误，并对这些错误作了原则性的和毫不留情的批评。现在党内正在进行巨大的工作，来纠正错误，克服弱点，提高政治警惕性，加强与工人阶级和广大劳动人民群众的联系。
    统一社会党中央委员会在六月二十一日所举行的全体会议上，通过了一项重要的决议，该决议对局势作了深刻的分析，并为党规定了加强群众工作、坚决实现新方针的具体任务。中央委员会特别建议，要在各个企业里举行党的会议和工人的会议，在这些会议上，干部们一定要“坦白地、勇敢地回答工人和其他工作人员所提出的问题。我们要发动一次保卫工人阶级的利益和全体劳动人民的幸福的坚决斗争、一次说明并实行我们的新政策，使正直的工人们了解他们所犯的错误的斗争、一次反对挑拨者的斗争。”
    把争取和平的斗争作为自己首要任务的共产党和工人党，正在加强它们与群众的联系，提高对反对派的阴谋诡计的警惕性，不疲倦地揭露和平的敌人的反人民政策和罪恶阴谋。
    共产党和工人党——争取劳动人民切身利益的最忠诚、最坚定的战士，正在更高地举着和平、各国人民民族独立和民主自由的旗帜。
