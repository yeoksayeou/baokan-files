    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The fact that the Yoshida government had long concealed Japan's huge debt to the United States was recently revealed by the Hatoyama Liberal Party, which formally split from the Yoshida Liberal Party in March. This matter exposes that the US government not only openly exploits Japan through various means, but also uses the shameless means of concealing debts with the help of the Yoshida government to extract wealth from Japan.

    When the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives held a meeting on the 6th, Ichiro Kono of the Hatoyama Liberal Party, holding a large number of documents as evidence, accused: Since the beginning of the Korean War three years ago until April 1952, the United States purchased 47,056,000 US dollars worth of military supplies from Japan on credit in the name of the occupying authorities' instructions, but the Yoshida government has been helping the United States to conceal this debt, "without taking any positive action to demand (the United States) to settle the account." Kono demanded that Yoshida immediately explain this issue on the spot. After this shameful, traitorous, and pro-American secret of Yoshida was exposed in the mutual attacks between their reactionary groups, he was in a very embarrassing situation. He hurriedly waved to his Foreign Minister Okazaki to come out and relieve him, but Okazaki could not answer in the face of clear facts. As a result, a burst of roars erupted from the venue. With the help of Hideji Kawasaki of the Reform Party, who proposed a motion to adjourn the meeting "to allow the government time to prepare an appropriate response," Yoshida temporarily escaped this predicament.

    After the incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of the Yoshida government had to admit that Ichiro Kono's accusations were indeed true, and perfunctorily stated that they would recover the debt from the United States. According to Kyodo News, this incident has stalled the Diet's review of the budget draft. The Yoshida government's response "failed to satisfy the opposition parties." The opposition parties intend to attack it "more sharply." The Yoshida "government is very worried about how to stop the opposition parties from launching such an offensive."

    吉田隐瞒美国对日本的债务暴露了美国压榨日本又一无耻手段
    【新华社讯】东京消息：吉田政府长期隐瞒日本对美国的巨额债权的事情，日前被从三月和吉田自由党正式分裂的鸠山自由党所揭发。这件事情暴露了美国政府不仅以各种办法公开剥削日本，而且还在吉田政府的帮助下用隐瞒债务的无耻手段榨取日本。
    日本众议院预算委员会六日举行会议时，鸠山自由党的河野一郎手举着大批的文件证据指责说：自从三年前朝鲜战争开始时起到一九五二年四月，美国以占领当局指令的名义向日本赊购了四千七百零五万六千美元的军需物资，但吉田政府一直帮着美国隐瞒这笔债务，“毫未采取任何积极行动要求（美国）结账”。河野要求吉田立即当场解释这个问题。吉田这一见不得人的卖国媚美的隐私在他们反动集团之间的互相攻讦中被揭发之后，处境十分狼狈。他慌忙招手要他的外相冈崎出来为他解围，但是冈崎在明明白白的事实面前也无从对答。于是，会场发出一片吼骂声。在改进党的川崎秀二提出休会动议，“以使政府有时间准备作适当的答复”的帮助下，吉田才暂时逃脱了这一窘境。
    事件发生后，吉田政府的外务省和通商产业省都不得不承认河野一郎的指责确是事实，并敷衍地表示要向美国收回这笔债款。据共同社透露，这一事件已使国会对预算草案的审查工作为之搁延。吉田政府的答复，“未能使在野党满意”。在野党打算“更尖锐地”加以攻击。吉田“政府很耽心，如何挡住在野党，使它不能发动这种攻势”。
