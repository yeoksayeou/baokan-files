Northeast and North China regions have been actively carrying out breeding work for draught animals this year to solve the shortage of these animals. In Shanxi Province, North China, 63 counties and cities held meetings on promoting livestock breeding in order to carry out the breeding work in a timely manner. In Jilin Province, Northeast China, each county held livestock competitions to select breeding sires.

The draught animal breeding work in Northeast and North China this spring and summer has been successful. Jinan and Jinzhong in Shanxi Province completed 67 percent of this year's breeding plan before May 15. As of May 20, the public horse breeding stations in Shanxi had mated 4,202 mares, completing 70 percent of the original plan. According to statistics from early June, the 808 horse breeding stations and 1,492 donkey breeding stations in Liaoxi Province had mated more than 16,000 mares and more than 9,700 jennies (using horses for breeding). In Qian'an County, Jilin Province, 8,962 out of the 9,000 breeding mares were found suitable sires, and 6,500 of them had already been bred.

The "private studs" (households raising breeding animals) in rural areas play a significant role in carrying out draught animal breeding work. Governments at all levels attach great importance to this industry, providing technical guidance and issuing loans to breeding households in need of support. For example, breeding households in Yushu County, Jilin Province, received breeding horse loans of 2 billion yuan this year. In supporting "private studs," some regions have also correctly implemented the policy of "voluntary mutual benefit" between "private studs" and the owners of the female animals. For example, in Qian'an County, Jilin Province, many mare owners prepaid breeding grain before mating, which not only overcame the purely profit-oriented view of stud owners who only cared about mating and not about ensuring a foal, but also further encouraged the enthusiasm of stud owners to raise good breeding animals and actively carry out breeding work.

In promoting draught animal breeding work, many regions have paid attention to solving the problem of insufficient breeding animals. Most areas of Northeast China have actively organized the masses to evaluate and select breeding sires. In Jilin Province alone, 19 counties selected 3,368 breeding sires and 858 reserve breeding sires. Some areas of Shanxi Province carried out the rational allocation of breeding animals in this year's draught animal breeding work. For example, of the 42 breeding animals in Xinzhuang Village, Hongtong County, the province not only set up stations for breeding in the county, but also extracted 17 breeding animals to set up stations for breeding in Fenxi, Linfen and other counties. In order to universally promote livestock breeding work, Changtu County, Liaoxi Province, also organized a breeding network this year.

In breeding draught animals, many areas have responded to the call of the People's Government to breed donkeys and mules, and expanded the number of donkeys bred by stallions. It is estimated that approximately 30,000 to 50,000 mules and donkeys can be bred this year in parts of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe. According to incomplete statistics from 11 counties in Yanbei Prefecture, Shanxi Province, 1,674 out of 4,124 draught animals bred were donkeys bred by horses. This will have a significant impact on enhancing the animal power of rural areas.

### 东北华北各地积极进行耕畜配种工作

    东北华北各地积极进行耕畜配种工作
    今年东北、华北各地为了解决耕畜不足的困难，积极进行了耕畜配种工作。华北区山西省为了适时开展配种工作，曾有六十三个县市举行过开展牲畜配种工作的会议。东北区吉林省各县都举行牲畜比赛会，进行选定种公畜的工作。
    东北、华北各地今年春夏两季的耕畜配种工作是有成绩的。山西晋南和晋中在五月十五日前已完成今年配种计划的百分之六十七。山西各公营配马站截至五月二十日已交配马四千二百零二匹，完成原计划的百分之七十。据六月初的统计，辽西省的八百零八处配马站和一千四百九十二处配驴站，已配母马一万六千余匹，配母驴（用马配）九千七百余头。吉林乾安县能繁殖的九千匹母马中，已有八千九百六十二匹找好了适当的公畜，其中已有六千五百匹配了种。
    各地农村中的“民桩”（养种畜户），对进行耕畜配种工作的作用很大。各地政府对这种行业是十分重视的，除了在技术上给以指导外，并且对需要扶植的种畜户还发放贷款。如吉林榆树县的种畜户今年即贷到种马贷款二十亿元。在扶植“民桩”的工作中，有的地区还正确地贯彻了“民桩”与母畜主间自愿两利的政策。如吉林省乾安县许多母马主在配种前就预交了配种粮，这样不但克服了种畜户过去只管配种不管准驹的单纯营利观点，而且进一步鼓励了种畜主养好种畜积极进行配种工作的情绪。
    在推动耕畜配种工作中，许多地区注意了解决种畜不足的问题。东北大部地区都积极组织群众评选了种公畜。仅吉林省十九个县就选出种公畜三千三百六十八头，候补种公畜八百五十八头。山西省若干地区在今年耕畜配种工作中进行了合理分配种畜的工作。如该省洪洞县辛庄村的四十二头种畜，除了在本县设站配种外，又抽出十七头种畜到汾西、临汾等县设站配种。辽西省昌图县为了普遍推动牲畜配种工作，今年还组织了配种网。
    许多地区的群众在繁殖耕畜中，响应人民政府提倡繁殖驴骡的号召，扩大了公马配驴的数字。辽东、辽西及热河部分地区，据估计今年约可繁殖驴骡三万至五万头。另据山西雁北专区十一个县不完全统计，在配种四千一百二十四头耕畜中就有一千六百七十四头是用马配的驴。这对于增强农村的畜力将产生重大的影响。
