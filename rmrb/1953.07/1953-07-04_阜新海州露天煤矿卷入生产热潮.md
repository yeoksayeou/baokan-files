Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 2nd. The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, which officially started production on July 1st, has entered a production upsurge. On the eve of "July 1st," the workers expressed their determination to Chairman Mao to contribute to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao by doing a good job in production. For the past two days, many workers have put on their new work clothes in advance, put on commemorative badges for the transfer of the open-pit coal mine to production, and headed to the open-pit mine. Liu Zhenqian, an elderly driver of the No. 43 electric shovel, proposed the slogan "Transform old electric shovels into new electric shovels." As a result, the entire team implemented "slow at first, then smooth, then steady, then fast," creating advanced experience in output, quality, and safety, and achieved results. The Li Zhanchun electric shovel team increased work efficiency by 11.2% under low heading operations. The transportation section launched mutual connections between sections. A shift of Liu Yongsheng's timbering team completed the planned tasks of three shifts. The workers in the concrete stone work, in order to supply the production needs for the amount of earth to be excavated in time, overfulfilled the task by 16%. The workers are continuing to carry out labor emulation with high enthusiasm, so that production and construction can achieve greater victories.

    阜新海州露天煤矿卷入生产热潮
    【新华社阜新二日电】“七一”正式生产的阜新海州露天煤矿已卷入生产热潮中。“七一”前夕，工人们向毛主席表示了决心，以搞好生产向中国共产党和毛主席献礼。两天来，许多工人提前穿好新的作业服，戴好露天煤矿移交生产的纪念章，走向露天矿场。四十三号电铲老年司机刘振乾提出要“改变老电铲为新电铲”的口号，全组因而贯彻执行了“一慢二平三稳四快”，创造产量、质量、安全的先进经验，取得了成绩。李占春电铲小组在低掌子作业的情况下，工作效率提高百分之十一点二。运输段各区间展开了互相间的联系。刘永生撑木组一个班完成了三个班的计划任务。混凝土石方的工人为了及时供应生产需要掘土量，超额完成任务百分之十六。工人们正以高度的热情继续开展劳动竞赛，使生产和建设一样取得更大的胜利。
