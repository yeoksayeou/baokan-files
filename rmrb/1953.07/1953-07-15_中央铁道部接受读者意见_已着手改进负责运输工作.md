Central Railway Department Accepts Reader Opinions
Has Begun Improving Responsible Transportation Work

Letter from the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government: The criticisms in the People's Daily on May 28 regarding the railway's responsible transportation work are correct. The shortcomings in the railway's responsible transportation, especially in less-than-carload (LCL) freight transport, are serious. Due to our lack of education for employees on cherishing state property and our failure to effectively implement the spirit of responsible transportation, field employees generally have the erroneous idea of pursuing quantity and disregarding transportation quality. Since the launch of the "Full Load Over-Axle 500 Kilometers" campaign, we have failed to thoroughly inspect the work and correct deviations in a timely manner. Field business employees, solely for "full load," pursue static load indicators, accumulating LCL freight, and even leading to serious irresponsibility and violations of discipline. In addition, the lack of coordination in internal railway transportation work has resulted in goods not arriving on schedule. Based on the above situation, we convened an LCL planned transportation meeting on June 11, where we criticized the ideological style of irresponsibility towards state property. In order to improve responsible transportation work, based on the current specific situation of the railway, we have formulated LCL planned transportation measures, which will soon be announced and implemented nationwide. We have also established a liaison system between various railway administrations to solve handover issues. In the third quarter, we plan to combine this with the anti-bureaucracy movement to comprehensively inspect field work and further correct shortcomings.

Regarding the shortcomings in responsible transportation work revealed in the letters from People's Daily readers, we are now responding with the information we have learned and the results of the handling:

One, two packages of peanuts transported from Zhengzhou Station to Xinyang were delayed because the freight office and the dispatching office of Zhengzhou Station did not communicate. After the freight office loaded the goods onto the train, they considered their task completed after sending the freight bill to the dispatching office. The dispatching office did not properly manage the operating vehicles and did not pay enough attention to LCL cars. Coupled with the congestion of temporary relief grain cars, the LCL car could not be promptly dispatched. Despite repeated inquiries from the destination station, the Zhengzhou Station freight searcher only found that it had been loaded and did not ask whether the car had been dispatched. This irresponsibility caused the LCL car carrying peanuts to be delayed at Zhengzhou Station for eight days, causing serious losses to the shipper. The Zhengzhou Railway Administration has been instructed to handle this seriously.

Two, Yanggao Station accepted 360 kilograms of pig liver (erroneously stated as over 600 jin in the previous reader's letter) for shipment to Beijing. At that time, there were restrictions on the entry of fresh and frozen meat into Beijing. The station initially mistakenly thought that pig liver was not pork. After accepting the shipment, they realized that it could not be transported and notified the shipper to cancel the shipment. The shipper, being entrusted through several parties, could not handle the return and requested to store it at the station to wait for the restrictions to be lifted. The station did not consider that pig liver easily spoils and did not understand whether the transportation restrictions could be lifted in the shortest period, blindly agreeing to wait. It was not until more than fifty days later that the shipper and the station negotiated to change the destination to Tsinghua Yuan. Furthermore, because the detailed address of the consignee was not filled in, it was impossible to notify them, delaying the collection period. This series of irresponsible delays caused all the pig liver to spoil. In addition to punishing the derelict personnel, we are responsible for compensating the shipper's losses.

Three, some grain cars dispatched by Fangzi Station and the Wuchang Grain Bureau had leaking tarpaulins or were only covered with one tarpaulin. Because the tarpaulin had leaks, it caused moisture damage. The reader reported a shortage of thirty packages, which was actually moisture damage to thirty packages. The other shortage of twenty-two packages was actually short delivery by the shipper, which has been certified by the shipper. This also shows that the railway personnel concerned were careless in accepting the goods and failed to check them properly, and were not responsible enough during transportation. The thirty packages of grain damaged by moisture have been decided to be compensated for 4.5 million yuan according to the shipper's request. The moisture damage caused by leaking tarpaulins will be handled after the shipper makes a claim for compensation and there is concrete evidence.

Four, the Changwei Prefectural Grain Bureau transported a lot of grain that was lost, on the one hand, because the packaging was old and damaged, and on the other hand, the personnel concerned did not fulfill their responsibilities when unloading the vehicles, resulting in spillage of grain. According to the shipper, there is no accurate figure for how much grain was spilled, but the spilled grain has been swept up and put into bags afterwards. Because it did not exceed the prescribed loss standard, the shipper did not request compensation. In addition to the relevant personnel making a self-criticism, education for loading and unloading workers will be strengthened to improve our work.

Five, the China National Cotton, Yarn & Fabrics Corporation's Handan branch transported cotton yarn without anti-abrasion pads, and the railway staff did not seriously check, resulting in abrasion. Our bureau has sent personnel to the company to jointly study and improve loading methods.

### 中央铁道部接受读者意见  已着手改进负责运输工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    中央铁道部接受读者意见
    已着手改进负责运输工作
    中央人民政府铁道部商务局来信：五月二十八日人民日报读者对铁路负责运输工作的批评是正确的。铁路负责运输，特别是零担货物的运输，工作中的缺点是严重的。由于我们对员工缺乏爱护国家资财的教育，也没有很好地贯彻负责运输的精神，致使现场员工普遍有追求数量、不顾运输质量的错误思想。满载超轴五百公里运动开展以来，我们未能深入检查工作，及时纠正偏差，现场商务员工单纯为“满载”追求静载重指标，积压了零担货物，甚至因而产生严重不负责任及违章乱纪的现象；此外还因铁路内部运输工作中的不协调，致使货物不能如期运到。根据以上情况，我们于六月十一日召开了零担计划运输会议，对于对国家资财不负责任的思想作风展开了批评；为了改进负责运输工作，根据目前铁路具体情况，拟定了零担计划运输办法，即将在全国铁路公布实行；并建立了各管理局间联系制度，以解决交接问题。在第三季度内我们准备结合反官僚主义运动，普遍检查现场工作，进一步纠正缺点。
    关于人民日报读者来信所揭露的负责运输工作中存在的缺点，现将我们了解的情况和处理的结果答复如下：
    一、由郑州站运往信阳两包花生米，由于郑州站货运室与运转室工作没有联系，货运室于货物装车后，把货票送交运转室就算任务完了；运转室对作业车辆掌握不好，对零担车重视不够，加以临时救济粮车拥挤，以致未能及时挂出。虽经到站一再查催，郑州站货物搜查员只查出已经装出，就不再追问该车已否挂出。这样不负责任致使装花生米的零担车在郑州站延搁了八天，使货主遭受了严重的损失。现已责成郑州铁路管理局认真处理。
    二、阳高站承运猪肝三百六十公斤（前读者来信中误为六百多斤）到北京。当时北京地区有禁止鲜冻肉进城的限制，车站起初误以为猪肝不是猪肉，受理后才发觉不能运，就通知发货人取消运送。发货人因是辗转受托，拉回去无法处理，要求存站等待解除限制后再运。车站没有考虑猪肝易于腐坏，不了解运输限制是否可于最短期间解除，盲目同意待运。一直等了五十多天，才经货主与车站商定改运清华园；又因没有填明收货人详细地址，无法通知，延误了领取期间。这一连串不负责任的拖拉现象，使猪肝全部腐坏了。我们除给失职人员以处分外，并负责赔偿货主的损失。
    三、坊子站及武昌粮食局发送的粮车，有的因蓬布凹漏，有的只盖一张篷布，因篷布有漏缝，以致造成湿损。读者反映短少了三十包实际是湿损三十包，另短少二十二包实际是货主少送，已由货主出具证明。由此也说明铁路有关人员对货物承运粗枝大叶，失于检查，在运送中也不够负责。湿损的三十包粮食，根据货主要求，已决定赔偿四十五万元。篷布凹漏造成的湿损，俟货主提出赔偿要求，有了具体根据再作处理。
    四、昌潍专署粮食局所运粮谷漏失很多，一方面因为包装破旧，另方面有关人员在卸车时没有尽到责任，以致撒漏粮谷。据货主反映，撒漏粮谷究有多少尚无确实数字，但事后已将撒漏粮谷扫起装入袋中，因为没超过规定的亏耗标准，货主没有要求赔偿。除有关人员进行检讨外，并加强对装卸工人的教育，以改进我们的工作。
    五、中国花纱布公司邯郸分公司所运纱布没有备置防磨垫，铁路员工也没有认真检查，以致造成磨损，我局已派员到该公司会同研究改进装运办法。
