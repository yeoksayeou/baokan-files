    Beijing Machine General Factory Has Failed to Complete the Plan for Manufacturing New Products for Eleven Consecutive Months
    Since July of last year, when the Beijing Machine General Factory began trial production of Soviet-style medium universal milling machines, it has failed to fulfill the state plan for eleven months until May of this year. The factory originally planned to produce 41 universal milling machines (including one for trial production) in the second half of last year, but only one was assembled by the end of the year. This year, the plan was to produce 17 units in the first quarter and 31 units in the second quarter, but as of the end of May, not a single finished product had been manufactured. Over the past year, the factory has been borrowing money from the bank since the fourth quarter of last year to make ends meet due to its long-term failure to fulfill the state plan. By the end of May, it had borrowed 13.4 billion yuan, resulting in significant losses to the state. The main reasons for this situation are:
    First, leading cadres are eager to achieve specialization and fail to organize production based on the specific conditions of the factory. In May of last year, the National Machine Tool Conference determined that the factory's long-term development direction was the production of milling machines. At that time, the former Machine Industry Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Department instructed the factory to trial-produce universal milling machines and decided to produce 40 units in the second half of the year. The factory's leading cadres subjectively rushed to carry out specialized production without careful consideration or detailed research. They only looked at the photos of the universal milling machines and relied on their past experience in producing shapers to accept the task and hastily formulated a plan to trial-produce one unit in two months and produce 40 units in four months. At that time, the blueprints for the universal milling machines had not yet arrived, and a series of technical preparation, production organization, and material preparation work had not been done well. There were also many problems with the equipment (for example, the factory only had two old boring machines at that time, so large precision holes could not be processed; there were also very few grinding machines, and even if the production capacity of the grinding machines was fully utilized, only three parts could be ground in the second half of last year). However, under the guidance of subjectivist thinking, the production of old products was stopped at the same time as the decision to trial-produce new products. As a result, the entire factory fell into a state of extreme chaos because the new products could not be connected. The Machine Industry Bureau at that time did not conduct inspections or provide specific assistance to the factory, but only demanded that the factory complete the task by "pressuring" it (although the leaders of the bureau went to the factory many times and solved some specific problems after the problem became serious, they did not solve the fundamental problem). At the beginning of this year, the factory neither summarized last year's experience nor learned from its lessons, nor did it carry out remedial work for the trial production. It clearly knew that there were errors in the blueprints, and that tools and fixtures were missing, and that there were quality problems, but it continued production. As a result, the task was not completed month after month, and production became even more chaotic.
    Second, the trial production of new products is not organized according to regular procedures, but is carried out in a rush manner, causing serious confusion in production. According to the suggestions of Soviet experts and the experience of national, especially Northeast China, machine manufacturing factories in the trial production of new products over the past three years, the steps for trial production of new products must be: from sample trial production to small-batch production and then to mass production. Before the trial production of samples, technical preparation work must be done well, mainly including reviewing blueprints, formulating technical operating procedures for major components, and designing and manufacturing the necessary tools, fixtures, and gauges during the trial production process. Otherwise, a series of confusion will inevitably be brought to future production management and technical management. When the Beijing Machine General Factory began trial production of new products, it did not have a complete set of blueprints. In order to save time, it rushed to copy the blueprints translated by the Design Company of the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration in just 20 days, drawing and issuing blueprints for trial production at the same time, and also ordered formal production. Due to the poor quality of translators and copyists, errors abounded, and the blueprints have not yet been fully corrected. Before the trial production, the necessary tools, fixtures, and gauges were not prepared. At the beginning of the trial production, components were produced in a rush by hand. After a year, only one boring fixture for the bed was processed. Technical operating procedures have not been formulated, and even the processing procedures are not necessarily fixed. For example, when processing the rotary table, holes should be drilled first and then tapped, but because there is no fixed processing procedure, the workers tap first and then drill. After drilling the holes, the threads are gone. The factory pointed out in its summary in April of this year: "No one knows exactly how many processes and components a universal milling machine has." This chaotic situation has not fundamentally changed to this day.
    Third, unclear departmental responsibilities and chaotic production and technical management. The division of labor between departments in the Beijing Machine General Factory is unclear, and responsibilities are not clear. The planning department does not usually study the use of equipment or the consumption of defective products, man-hours, and machine-hours. At the end of the month, it only temporarily collects some data to deal with the reports to the higher authorities. The department spends all day busy filling out work order forms (which are actually the responsibility of the production department or other relevant departments). Even making a wooden frame requires a permit from the planning department. Before March, the production department did not issue quotas to the workshops, allowing the workshops to produce at will. The factory only made a work plan for the machining workshop, but it was not discussed by the masses, so it was unrealistic and could not be implemented. Production scheduling is not flexible, and the phenomenon of work stoppages due to lack of materials is extremely serious. The intermittent working hours in the machining workshop accounted for 15 percent of the production working hours in March, 14.4 percent in April, and although it improved in May, it still accounted for 9 percent of the production working hours. Due to the lack of component supply, some workers in the assembly workshop have been idle from the beginning of June to today (June 26).
    There is a lack of a system for machine maintenance. Machines are repaired as soon as they break down. The repair of machines is also slow and dragging. It took half a year to repair a shaper. Due to the lack of a maintenance system, the phenomenon of machine failure is also extremely serious. Machine failure downtime accounted for 6.6 percent of the total working hours in April and 6 percent in May.
    There are also many problems in technical management, mainly the lack of sound quality inspection standards and inspection systems. Quality inspection standards are not precise where they should be, but unimportant small screws are fastened very tightly. Many tolerances on the blueprints are not clear. The machining workshop does not have an intermediate inspection system, and components are often scrapped in batches. Last year, the workshop processed a batch of beds, and eight out of ten were scrapped; this year, in May, five elevating tables were processed, and all five were scrapped. Defective product man-hours in the workshop accounted for 6.2 percent of the production man-hours in March and 7.8 percent in April. In order to catch up with the task, even if the components are unqualified, they are used reluctantly. The beds of the eight universal milling machines that were processed this year were all recycled products. Workers said: "If a defective product is found, the workshop director only needs to tell the engineer." The inspectors are also irresponsible, looking at the components and considering them qualified. Among the qualified components, defective products are often found during assembly, and some components are even put into the warehouse as qualified products without being completely processed. According to statistics, 38 percent of the components currently in the warehouse need to be scrapped or reworked. During partial assembly in the assembly workshop, small parts are matched with large parts. If they don't match, they wait for the machining workshop to make them and then assemble them; during final assembly, if they don't match, they are disassembled and repaired extensively. When assembling a universal milling machine in the second quarter, it was disassembled and assembled five times, and it took two or three months. The original plan was to assemble the elevating table part of a universal milling machine in 100 man-hours; now it has increased to 400 or 500 man-hours and there is still no certainty.
    Fourth, weak political work, lax labor discipline, and low production morale also affect the completion of tasks. For a long time in the past, the factory's political work could not be closely integrated with production. Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres were not familiar with production and did not study production operations. Therefore, many problems in production could not be organized by the workers to solve. In terms of propaganda and mobilization, there is also a lack of planning and mass participation. The Party's propaganda and education committee only does temporary propaganda in the workshop when it sees a problem. Due to the long-term failure to complete the plan, workers often have no work to do, production morale is low, and labor discipline is also poor. Many people are late and leave early, and some night-shift workers even bring alcohol to work and sleep during work hours. This phenomenon has existed for a long time and has not been corrected in time.
    The problems existing in the Beijing Machine General Factory are serious. Now the leaders of the Second Machine Industry Bureau of the Central First Machine Industry Department and the factory have initially realized the seriousness of the problems. The factory began to establish certain systems in March by exposing the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility. Political work has also been improved. However, various major systems, especially the responsibility system for departments and technical management, have not been seriously established. Departmental responsibilities are still unclear, and the chaotic phenomena in production have not been corrected. Leading cadres have not reached a consensus on the steps of trial production. The factory should quickly rectify its work according to the following steps.
    First, clarify the scope of responsibilities of each department, strengthen the responsibility system, and strengthen planning management and technical management.
    Second, carry out remedial work for trial production step by step by solving the weak links in production (such as the main components processed on boring machines and gantry planers) and key technical problems. Systematically and selectively review blueprints, study, formulate, and revise operating procedures with workers, first the technical operating procedures for major components, quickly supplement the necessary tools, fixtures, and gauges, carry out technical recording work, establish inspection standards and inspection systems, and then solve other problems. Oppose the non-selective and general remedial work for trial production.
    Third, strengthen political work. The Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League should carry out work around the completion of the national production plan, learn from the experience of the May 3rd Factory, strengthen the political education of departmental technical staff, strengthen discipline education for the workers, and improve the workers' awareness in order to quickly reverse the situation of long-term failure to complete the national plan.

    北京机器总厂连续十一个月未完成制造新产品的计划
    北京机器总厂自去年七月份开始试制苏式中型万能铣床以来，至今年五月，十一个月一直没有完成国家计划。该厂去年下半年度原计划生产万能铣床四十一台（包括试制一台），到年底仅装出一台。今年第一季度计划生产十七台，第二季度计划生产三十一台，但到五月底为止，一台成品也没有制出。一年来该厂由于长期不能完成国家计划，自去年第四季度开始向银行借债度日，到五月底为止，已借款一百三十四亿元，国家损失很大。产生这种情况的主要原因是：
    第一，领导干部急于达到专业化，不根据工厂具体情况组织生产。去年五月全国工具机会议确定该厂的长远发展方向为生产铣床，当时，原中央重工业部机器工业管理局即指示该厂试制万能铣床，并决定下半年度生产四十台。该厂领导干部主观地急于要进行专业化生产，没有经过周密考虑，详细研究，仅看了看万能铣床的照片，依凭过去生产牛头刨床的经验，就接受了该项任务，并草率地制订了二个月试制一台、四个月生产四十台的计划。而当时万能铣床的图纸还没有到，一系列的技术准备工作、生产组织与材料准备工作都没有做好，设备上存在的问题也很多（如当时全厂只有二台破旧的镗床，大件精密孔就无法加工，磨床也特别少，即使充分发挥磨床的生产能力，去年下半年也只能磨制三台部件），但在主观主义思想的指导下，在决定新产品试制的同时，即停止旧产品的生产；由于新产品接不上，全厂遂陷入极端混乱的状态中。当时的机器工业管理局也没有对该厂进行检查与具体帮助，而仅以“压”的方法，要求该厂完成任务（待问题严重后，该局领导方面虽多次下厂，解决了些具体问题，但并没有解决根本的问题）。今年年初，该厂既没有总结去年的经验，接受教训，也没有进行试制的补课工作，明明知道图纸有错误，工具、卡具没有，质量有问题，但仍继续生产。结果月月完不成任务，生产更形混乱。
    第二，不按正规步骤，组织新产品的试制工作，而是用突击方式进行试造，造成生产上严重的混乱现象。根据苏联专家的建议和三年来全国特别是东北各机器制造厂新产品试制工作的经验，新产品试制工作的步骤必须是：由样品试造到小批生产再转入大批生产。在试制样品前，必须做好技术准备工作，主要是审查图纸，拟订主要部件的技术操作规程，设计与制造在试制过程中必要的工具、卡具、量具等，否则就必然给以后生产管理与技术管理带来一系列的混乱。北京机器总厂在开始试制新产品时，没有整份图纸，为了赶时间，在短短二十天内，按照东北机械工业管理局设计公司翻译的图纸，突击描绘，一面绘图，一面发图试造，同时又下令正式生产。由于翻译人员、描图人员质量差，错误百出，直到目前，图纸还没有全面校正。试制前，也没有准备好必需的工具、卡具、量具，试制
    一开始，就用手工业方式突击生产部件，经过一年的时间，加工部件仅有一个床身镗孔卡具。技术操作规程也没有制订，甚至加工程序也不一定。如加工回转盘，本应先打眼，后扣丝，但因没有一定的加工程序，工人就先扣丝，后打眼；打好眼，丝扣也没有了。该厂今年四月份总结中曾指出：“究竟一台万能铣床有多少工序，多少部件，谁也搞不清楚。”这种混乱状况，至今没有根本的改变。
    第三，科室责任不清，生产管理与技术管理混乱。北京机器总厂科室之间，分工不明，职责不清。计划科平时不研究设备运用情况和废品、工时、台时的消耗情况等，在月末，为了应付上级报表，才临时收集些资料。该科终日只忙于填发工作命令单
    （实际上是生产科或其他有关科的职责），甚至做个木架子，也得由计划科批条，生产科在三月份以前不向车间下指标，听任车间生产自流。该厂仅仅加工车间做了一个作业计划，但也没有交群众讨论，因而不切实际，不能执行。生产调度不灵，停工待料现象极为严重。加工车间三月份的间断工时占生产工时的百分之十五，四月份为百分之十四点四，五月份虽有好转，但仍占生产工时的百分之九。装配车间因部件供不上，总装配的部分工人自六月初停工到今天（六月二十六日）无活可干。
    在机器检修工作上，缺乏制度。机床随坏随修。修理机床又拖拖沓沓，一台牛头刨床，修理了半年，才修好。由于缺乏检修制度，机器发生故障的现象，也极严重。四月份机器故障停工工时就占总工时的百分之六点六，五月份占百分之六。
    技术管理上也存在很多问题，主要是质量检查标准与检查制度不健全。质量检查标准该精密的不精密，不重要的小螺丝钉，却扣得很紧。图纸上的公差很多不明确。加工车间没有中间检查制度，部件往往成批地成了废品。该车间去年加工一批床身，加工十个，就废了八个；今年五月份加工升降台，加工五个，废五个。该车间三月份的废品工时，就占了生产工时的百分之六点二，四月份占了百分之七点八。为了赶任务，部件虽不合格，也凑付着用。今年加工完的八个万能铣床，床身都是回用品。工人说：“检查出废品，只要车间主任向工程师说一声，就行了。”检查人员也不负责任，看了看部件，就算检查合格。在检查合格的部件中，在装配时，往往又发现废品，甚至有些部件没有加工完，就作为合格品入了库。据统计：目前已入库的部件中，有百分之三十八要报废或退修。装配车间在部分装配时，小件凑大件，凑不上就等加工车间做出来再装；到总装配时，凑不上就大拆大修。第二季装配一台万能铣床时，拆装了五次，装了两三个月，原计划装配一台万能铣床的升降台部分，需一百工时；现在增至四五百工时，尚无把握。
    第四，政治工作薄弱，劳动纪律松弛，生产情绪不高，也影响了任务的完成。该厂过去较长的时间内，政治工作不能与生产紧密结合，党、工会和青年团干部不熟悉生产，不钻研生产业务，因而生产中的许多问题，不能组织职工加以解决。在宣传鼓动工作方面，也缺乏计划性、群众性，只是党的宣教委员在车间内看到有什么问题，临时宣传一下。工人群众由于长期完不成计划，经常没活干，生产情绪不高，劳动纪律也差，迟到早退的很多，个别夜班工人甚至带酒上班，在工作时间，喝酒睡觉。这种现象曾长期存在，没得到及时纠正。
    北京机器总厂存在的问题是严重的。现在中央第
    一机械工业部第二机械工业管理局和该厂的领导方面已初步认识到问题的严重性。该厂三月份已通过揭发无人负责现象，开始建立了某些制度。政治工作也有了改进。但目前各种主要制度，特别是科室与技术管理方面的责任制度，还没有认真建立。科室职责仍然不明确，生产上的混乱现象尚未得到纠正。领导干部对试制工作的步骤，还没有取得一致的认识。该厂应迅速按照下列步骤，整顿工作。
    第一，明确各科室的职责范围，加强责任制，加强计划管理与技术管理。
    第二，有步骤地通过解决生产中的薄弱环节（如镗床与龙门刨床上加工的主要部件）及关键性的技术问题，进行试制补课工作，有系统而有重点地审查图纸，与工人共同研究、制订和修改操作规程，首先是主要部件的技术操作规程，迅速补充必要的工具、卡具、量具，进行技术记录工作，订立检查标准与检验制度，然后再解决其他问题，反对无重点地泛泛地进行试制的补课工作。
    第三，加强政治工作，党、工会、青年团应该围绕完成国家生产计划来进行工作，学习五三工厂的经验，加强科室技职人员的政治教育，加强对工人群众的纪律教育，提高工人的觉悟，以便迅速地扭转长期完不成国家计划的局面。
