Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th: Indian newspapers have condemned the Robertson-Syngman Rhee joint statement for failing to provide a guarantee that Syngman Rhee would comply with the armistice agreement.

    The "Times of India" editorial on the 15th stated: "The statement clearly lacks a definitive assurance that the South Korean government will, in fact, cooperate in implementing the armistice. Moreover, the statement has failed to answer any of the questions raised by Syngman Rhee's deliberate acts of bad faith." The editorial said, "Syngman Rhee has declared that he will only give the political conference a deadline of ninety days, after which he will do as he pleases. How then can anyone believe that the South Korean government genuinely wants peace?" The editorial continued: "If the political conference fails to reach an agreement within ninety days, any attempt by Syngman Rhee to sabotage the success of the political conference and to restart the war will implicate not only the United States, but also the United Nations." The editorial stated, "It is no longer a question of reaching some uneasy agreement with him (Syngman Rhee). There must be sufficient safeguards to ensure that he cannot undermine the armistice in the near or distant future." The editorial concluded: "Unless it is absolutely certain that it is the UN forces, not Syngman Rhee, who are in absolute control of the situation, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as stipulated and recommended by the armistice agreement, cannot perform its duties... India has no intention of mortgaging the lives of its soldiers to a reckless madman who has been indulged in causing trouble for a long time."

    The "National Herald" editorial on the 14th said: "If, as some believe, the United States is acting on the basis that Syngman Rhee will eventually be persuaded, then the United States may be disappointed, because the security treaty they propose to conclude with Syngman Rhee will tempt him to create 'incidents' to scuttle the armistice."

    The "Hindustan Times" editorial on the 13th stated: "A careful reading of the joint statement issued by Syngman Rhee and Robertson – the first draft of which was rejected by the South Korean President – gives one the unpleasant feeling that this document is not intended to announce an agreement, but merely to conceal the absence of an agreement with the most empty of words."

    The "Indian Express" editorial on the 14th said that the joint statement did not provide sufficient guarantees to prevent Syngman Rhee from engaging in provocations again. The "Free Press" editorial also stated: "The agreement already reached between the South Korean President and Robertson has done nothing to promote the cause of peace in Korea."

### 印度报纸谴责罗伯逊李承晚的联合声明  美国未对李承晚遵守停战协定提出保证

    印度报纸谴责罗伯逊李承晚的联合声明
    美国未对李承晚遵守停战协定提出保证
    【新华社新德里十六日电】    印度各报谴责罗伯逊和李承晚的联合声明并未对李承晚遵守停战协定提出保证。
    “印度时报”十五日的社论说：“声明中显然没有南朝鲜政府事实上将合作来执行停战的肯定的保证。此外，声明并没有能够答复任何一个由于李承晚的蓄意的背信行为所引起的问题。”社论说，“李承晚宣布他只给政治会议九十天的限期，限期一过，他就要畅所欲为。这样看来，大家怎么能相信南朝鲜政府真正是要和平呢？”社论说：“假如政治会议不能在九十天内达成协议，李承晚方面任何暗中破坏政治会议取得成功的机会和重新发动战争的企图，都不但将牵连美国，并且还将牵连联合国。”社论说，“现在已不再是和他（李承晚）达成某种不安的协议的问题了。必须要有足够的保障来保证使他不能在最近的将来或遥远的将来破坏停战协定。”社论最后说：“除非十分有把握使绝对控制局势的是联合国军而不是李承晚，停战协定所规定并建议成立的中立国委员会就不能执行职务。……印度无意把它的士兵的生命抵押给在很长时间内被纵容进行捣乱的狂妄之徒。”
    “国民先驱报”十四日的社论说：“假如，像某些人所相信的一样，美国是在李承晚终会被说服的基础上行事的话，那么，美国可能是要失望的，因为他们所建议与李承晚缔结的安全条约会引诱他去制造‘事件’使停战完蛋。”
    “印度斯坦报”十三日的社论说：“仔细一读李承晚和罗伯逊所发表的联合声明——南朝鲜总统曾拒绝这个声明的第一个草案——就会得到这样的不愉快的感觉，就是这个文件不是要宣布达成协议，只是要用最空洞的字眼来掩饰没有达成协议。”
    “印度快报”十四日的社论说：联合声明并没有提出足以防止李承晚再一次进行挑衅的保证。“自由新闻”的社论也说：“南朝鲜总统与罗伯逊之间已经达成的协议一点也没有促进朝鲜的和平事业。”
