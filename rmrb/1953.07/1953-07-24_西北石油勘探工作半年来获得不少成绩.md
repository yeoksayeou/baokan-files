Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 21st. The Northwest Petroleum Exploration Team and Drilling Team have been working hard in the deep mountains and wilderness for the past six months and have achieved results. More than fifty petroleum exploration teams have carried out various geological works in an area of more than 21,000 square kilometers, and have initially found some signs of potentially hidden new oil-bearing structures, and discovered some oil seeps, which are of great significance for further research and determination of new oil-bearing structures and drilling well locations in the second half of the year. In addition, more than thirty drilling teams have drilled more than 18,600 meters of exploratory wells and production wells. Many exploratory wells have discovered several oil layers, and some have found animal and plant fossils that can be used to study the problem of petroleum formation. Each team has also trained a large number of new geological and drilling talents. For example, the drilling team working in a certain area of northern Shaanxi has trained more than 600 drilling workers.
	
	At the beginning of April this year, each petroleum exploration team set off with various instruments and tents to many oil-bearing areas in the Northwest, and officially started work in mid-April. They were active in the towering mountains and Gobi deserts, going deep into many areas not marked on the map. Some teams insisted on working on high mountains where the air was thin and breathing was difficult, or on the Gobi desert where the summer sun peeled off their skin. Some teams had no water to drink, so they dug their own wells to fetch water or used camels to carry water from dozens of miles away for drinking. Some teams in the deep mountains used gauze to cover their faces to avoid being bitten by a small mosquito called "horse tiger." Many other teams had no vegetables to eat, so they ate rice with chili peppers and salt. They overcame natural obstacles with difficulty, drew geological maps, and insisted on one or two hours of political study when they returned to their tents after work every day.

	Each team received great help from Soviet experts in their work. Soviet experts personally went to the field teams in early May to assist in their work. They taught the geological staff the purpose of clarifying general surveys, detailed surveys, and detailed measurement work, and emphasized the importance of hydrogeology, observing terrain, and geomorphological work, and helped each team revise their design books. Once, a Soviet expert used the method of observing terrain and geomorphology to analyze the characteristics of the local geological structure and inferred that there were two new oil-bearing structures to the east of a certain place. Later, this conclusion was confirmed, which greatly inspired the geological staff.

### 西北石油勘探工作半年来获得不少成绩

    西北石油勘探工作半年来获得不少成绩
    【新华社西安二十一日电】西北石油勘探队和钻井队半年来在深山野外艰苦工作，已获得成绩。五十几个石油勘探队已在二万一千多平方公里的区域内做了各项地质工作，初步找到了一些可能潜伏新储油构造的迹象，发现了一些油苗露头，对下半年进一步研究和确定新储油构造、确定钻井井位有很大作用。另外有三十几个钻井队已钻了一万八千六百多公尺的探井和生产井，许多探井发现了几个油层，有的找到了可供研究石油生成问题的动植物化石。各队还培养了大批新的地质和钻井人才，如在陕北某地工作的钻井队就培养了六百多名钻井工人。
    各石油勘探队在今年四月初，带着各种仪器和帐篷向西北许多蕴藏着石油的地区进发，四月中旬正式开始工作。他们活动在崇山峻岭和戈壁滩中，深入到很多在地图上没有注明的地带。有的队在空气稀薄、呼吸困难的高山上，或者在夏天的太阳晒脱脸皮的戈壁滩上坚持工作。有的队没有水喝，便自己挖井取水或用骆驼到数十里外驮水饮用。有的队在深山里为避免被一种叫“马老虎”的小蚊虫咬，便用纱布蒙起脸来工作。还有很多队没有青菜吃，就以辣子和盐下饭。他们艰苦地克服着自然障碍，绘出了一张张的地质图，每天工作完了回到帐篷里来，还坚持一、二小时的政治学习。
    各队在工作中，得到了苏联专家的很大帮助。苏联专家曾在五月初亲自到各野外队协助工作，他教给地质人员明确普查、详查和细测工作的目的性和注意水文地质、观察地形和地貌工作的重要性，帮助各队修改了设计书。有一次，苏联专家利用观察地形、地貌的方法，分析当地地质构造的特点，推断出某地以东有两个新储油构造，后来这个结论得到了证实，使地质工作人员受到很大的启发。
