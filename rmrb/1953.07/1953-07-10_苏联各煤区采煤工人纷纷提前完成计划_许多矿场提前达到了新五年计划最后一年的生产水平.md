Xinhua News Agency, July 9th dispatch from Moscow: Coal miners in various Soviet coal regions are fulfilling their production plans ahead of schedule, and the level of mechanization in the coal mining industry is constantly improving. Currently, many mines have reached the production levels stipulated for 1955, the final year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, ahead of schedule. In the Karaganda coal region, fifteen coal mines have reached this level. The largest Kirov mine in the Kuznetsk coal region has also reached the daily production quota for the final year of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Miners in the No. 17 coal mine in Donbass are currently producing 200 tons of coal more per day than the quota for the final year of the Five-Year Plan. It is even more common for mines to complete their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. News of the early completion of the semi-annual plan has been coming from major coal regions across the country. As early as June 16th, seven mines in the Kuznetsk coal region had already started production according to the second half-year plan. The "Black Mountain" mine has produced 25 more trainloads of coking coal than planned in the five and a half months since the beginning of this year.

These brilliant achievements of the coal miners are inseparable from the improvement of the mechanization level of coal mining work and the creative labor of the workers. In the Kuznetsk coal region, three-quarters of the coal in the Lenin Coal Mine is mined using coal mining combines, and the workers have adopted a one-day cycle indicator chart work system. As a result, the labor productivity of the mine has increased by 16 percent in five months, saving a value of one million rubles by reducing costs. In the Donbass coal region, the efficiency of coal mining combines has been greatly improved. Since the beginning of the year, the productivity of coal mining combines in the Lijievka Coal Mine has increased by 21 percent. The mines in the Donbass coal region have recently begun to use a new type of "miner" coal mining combine, which mechanizes the mining of thin coal seams with a thickness of 0.6 to 0.8 meters, greatly improving production efficiency. Due to the continuous increase of machinery and equipment, the total coal output of the Voroshilovgrad Coal Industry Trust has increased by 19.2 percent in three years, coking coal has increased by 34.7 percent, and labor productivity has increased by 19.2 percent. Martinets, a miner at the Second Mine of the Trust, completed the entire month's production task for May in two weeks after mastering the new machines. Workers such as G. Dubchik, V. Miroshnichenko, and I. Stepanchikhin from the Stalin Coal Industry Corporation created the highest production record, producing more than 10,000 tons of coal per month. In the Ural coal region, especially in the open-pit coal areas, the proportion of electric traction in the first four months of this year increased by 50 percent compared with the same period last year, three-quarters of the hoisting and transportation have been carried out by machines for remote control, and the coal mining part is using powerful excavators and power shovels. As a result, the mines of the Sverdlovsk Coal Industry Corporation have all completed the plan for the first four months of this year ahead of schedule, saving a value of 563,000 rubles by reducing costs alone.

    苏联各煤区采煤工人纷纷提前完成计划
    许多矿场提前达到了新五年计划最后一年的生产水平
    【新华社九日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联各煤区采煤工人纷纷提前完成生产计划，采煤工业的机械化水平不断提高。目前许多矿场已经提前达到了第五个五年计划规定的最后一年——一九五五年的生产水平。在卡拉干达煤区，有十五个煤坑达到了这一水平。库兹涅茨克煤区最大的基洛夫矿场，也达到了五年计划最后一年的每日生产定额。顿巴斯第十七号煤场中的矿工们目前每天生产量，甚至比五年计划最后一年定额还多二百吨煤。提前和超额完成今年上半年生产计划的矿场更是普遍。全国各大煤区都先后传出了提前完成半年计划的消息。早在六月十六日，库兹涅茨克煤区就有七个矿场按下半年计划生产。“黑山”矿场在今年年初以后五个半月的时间内就超过计划多生产了二十五列车焦煤。
    采煤工人的这些辉煌成就，是和采煤工作机械化水平的提高及工人们的创造性劳动分不开的。在库兹涅茨克煤区，列宁煤矿已有四分之三的煤是用采煤联合机开采的，工人们并采用了一昼夜一循环的指示图表工作制度，因此，该矿在五个月中劳动生产率提高了百分之十六，由此降低成本而节约的价值达一百万卢布。在顿巴斯煤区，采煤联合机的效能大大提高了，年初以来，利杰夫卡煤矿中采煤联合机的生产率即增加了百分之二十一。顿巴斯煤区各矿场，最近又开始使用一种新式“矿工”采煤联合机，使零点六到零点八公尺厚度的薄煤层的开采工作也机械化了，生产效率大大提高。伏罗希洛夫格勒煤业托辣斯的各煤矿，由于不断地增加机器设备，三年中，煤的总产量增加了百分之十九点二，炼焦用煤增加了百分之三十四点七，劳动生产率提高了百分之十九点二。该托辣斯第二矿场矿工马丁茨在掌握了新机器后，两周内就完成了五月份全月的生产任务。斯大林煤业联合企业工人格·杜布奇克、瓦·米罗什尼钦科、伊·斯捷凡奇兴等，创造最高生产纪录，每月生产一万多吨煤。在乌拉尔煤区，特别是露天煤区，今年头四个月中，用电力曳引的部分比去年同期增加了百分之五十，四分之三的提升运输已使用机器进行远距离操纵，采煤部分正使用效力强大的掘凿机和电铲。结果，斯维德洛夫斯克煤业联合企业的各煤矿，都提前完成了今年头四个月的计划，仅降低成本而节约的价值就有五十六万三千卢布。
