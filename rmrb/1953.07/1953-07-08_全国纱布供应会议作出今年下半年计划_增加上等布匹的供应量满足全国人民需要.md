The State-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation convened the Second National Yarn and Cloth Supply Conference in Shanghai from June 11th to June 29th. Through this conference, appropriate arrangements have been made for the supply of yarn and cloth in the national consumer market and the production of yarn and cloth for the second half of this year.

The main content of this conference was to discuss and resolve the issue of yarn and cloth variety supply and to determine the variety supply plan for the second half of the year. Although the production of yarn and cloth in terms of quantity can meet the needs of the people nationwide, it cannot fully satisfy consumers in terms of variety and color. The manager of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station reported at the meeting that due to the improvement of living standards, the people across the country need a large quantity of high-quality fabrics. In 1952, although the Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company supplied two and a half times more high-quality khaki and gabardine to the whole country than in 1951, it still could not meet consumer demand. When reviewing the supply work in the second quarter of this year, the conference found that local cotton yarn and cloth companies had underestimated the new situation of consumers needing a large number of high-quality and beautiful summer fabrics this year. Therefore, neither in variety nor in color, were they able to make sufficient supplies in a timely manner in the second quarter of this year. Based on this situation, the conference changed the past method of making plans in general terms and made a more detailed variety supply plan for the second half of the year. The supply of varieties such as khaki, gabardine, and various dark-colored printed cloths that consumers need was appropriately increased according to the conditions of possible increased production, while the varieties for which consumer demand is decreasing were reduced. In terms of the total supply, based on the sales situation in the first half of the year and the degree of increase in people's purchasing power in the second half of the year, the conference revised and expanded the original sales plan for the second half of the year, with an increase of 6.8% in yarn and 23% in cloth.

During the conference, in order to understand the production and sales situation, improve management methods, and ensure that the variety supply plan can effectively meet consumer needs, the sales units first formulated variety supply plans based on the needs of local consumers. Then, the provincial companies signed variety supply contracts with the purchasing and supply stations. At the same time, the purchasing and supply stations also exhibited samples of yarn and cloth varieties and colors, as well as new printed cloth patterns that they could supply, for the sales units in various regions to choose from, and solicited opinions from the sales units on the improvement of product colors.

    全国纱布供应会议作出今年下半年计划
    增加上等布匹的供应量满足全国人民需要
    国营中国花纱布公司自六月十一日到六月二十九日在上海召开了第二届全国纱布供应会议。通过这次会议，今年下半年全国纱布消费市场的供应和纱布的生产都已得到适当的安排。
    这次会议的主要内容是讨论和解决纱布的品种供应问题，确定下半年的品种供应计划。因为目前纱布的生产，虽然在数量上已可满足全国人民的需要，但在品种花色上，却还不能完全使消费者满意。上海采购供应站经理在会上报告说，全国人民由于生活水平的提高，需要大量的上等布匹。一九五二年上海花纱布公司供应全国的上等品种卡其、华达呢的数量，虽比一九五一年增加两倍半，但还是不能满足消费者的需要。会议在检查今年第二季度的供应工作时，发现各地花纱布公司对今年消费者需要大量上等的、美观的夏令布匹的新情况估计不足，因此无论在品种上花色上，今年第二季度都未能及时作到充分供应。会议根据这种情况，改变了过去笼统地作计划的办法，比较细致地作出了下半年纱布的品种供应计划。对消费者需要的卡其、华达呢和各种深色花布等品种的供应量，则根据可能增产的条件适当增加，而消费者需要日趋减少的品种则予以缩减。在总的供应量方面，会议根据上半年的销售情况和下半年人民购买力增长的程度，又把原定的下半年销售计划修改扩大，其中纱增加百分之六点八，布增加百分之二十三。
    会议进行期间，为了摸清产销情况，改进经营方法，使品种供应计划能切实地适应消费者的需要，首先由各销货单位根据当地消费者的需要作出品种供应计划，然后以省公司为单位，和各采购供应站签订了品种供应合同。同时，各采购供应站也把他们能供应的纱布品种、花色的样品和新的花布图案予以展览，以供各地销货单位选择，并征求销货单位对于产品花色的改进意见。（新华社）
