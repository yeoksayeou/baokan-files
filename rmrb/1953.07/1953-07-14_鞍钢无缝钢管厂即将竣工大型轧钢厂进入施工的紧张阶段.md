Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 13th: The construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's seamless steel tube plant has entered the final stage. By the end of June, the main projects had been basically completed, and most of the mechanical equipment had undergone partial test runs. Currently, the vast number of workers are accelerating preparations for a full test run. After the full test run, this modern, China's first seamless steel tube plant will begin to produce a large quantity of various seamless steel tubes.

    Now, the two grayish-white chimneys of this giant factory are towering into the sky. The tall, blue framework, composed of thousands of tons of metal, has been covered with a gray roof. Painters are braving the heat to apply the final layer of black paint. Several cables and pipelines for transporting water, steam, air, and gas extend from the surroundings of the plant to the factory buildings. Workers are speeding up the installation of the remaining equipment. The various large mechanical equipment, neatly arranged inside the factory building, shine brightly under the sunlight streaming in through the rows of skylight glass. The precise automatic control devices for managing this equipment have been installed on various operating platforms inside the plant, and electrical installation workers are connecting these devices to the main power room, which serves as the power source for the entire plant, with wires. In the spacious factory building, except for the electrical installation workers who are carrying out the installation and adjustment of certain small equipment, most of the workers in other trades have been transferred to new jobs because their work has been completed. The employees responsible for production have begun to enter the workshops. They are meticulously studying operating techniques around the mechanical equipment, stepping on the bright tiles and steel tiles that pave the ground, welcoming the arrival of the day of formal production.

    The workers who are carrying out the finishing touches are launching a heated competition for completion to ensure that the project can be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. In the competition, many "tricks" to accelerate the progress of the project have emerged. For example, the Tang Hongfang team, which is responsible for the test run and fuel oil work, developed a new tool with the help of Soviet experts, which increased work efficiency by twelve times, ensuring the progress of the partial test run. The Zhao Jizhong team, which installed cable lines, found a "trick" for threading screw threads, completing six days of work in two and a half days.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 13th: The construction of the new large rolling mill project of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has entered the most intense stage of construction. Since the large rolling mill project began construction in August last year, by June of this year, the entire project has completed 61% of the total project volume based on construction and installation value. Among them, the construction of major projects with complex technologies such as equipment foundations, mechanical installation, furnace construction, and metal structures is nearing completion; the construction of electrical installation and industrial pipeline installation projects is being accelerated.

    The vast number of workers building this factory have launched labor competitions on various construction sites. Metal structure workers are speeding up the installation of the last part of the framework; civil construction workers are immediately laying the roof on the erected framework. Inside the factory building, while some installation workers are still installing the remaining mechanical equipment, other workers are unfolding equipment cleaning work with oilcloth and sandpaper next to the installed rolling mill and around various equipment; electrical installation workers are tensely installing electrical equipment while threading and connecting cables, and have partially started electrical adjustments, preparing to supply power for the partial test run of the factory's mechanical equipment. Outside the factory building, workers of various trades are cooperating with each other to install crisscrossing waterways, cable pipelines, and gas pipelines, and are building factory railways and highways.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂即将竣工大型轧钢厂进入施工的紧张阶段
    【新华社鞍山十三日电】鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂的建设工程已进入竣工阶段。到六月底止，各项主要工程已基本上完成；机械设备也大半经过局部试车。目前，广大职工正加速准备全面试车的工作。在全面试车后，这座近代化的我国第一座的无缝钢管厂就要开始大量出产各种无缝钢管了。
    现在，这座巨型工厂的两个灰白色的大烟筒已高耸天空，用数千吨金属组成的天蓝色的高大房架已铺上灰色的屋面，油工们正冒着炎热涂抹着最后的一层黑色油漆。数条埋藏电缆和输送水、蒸汽、风、瓦斯的管道，从厂的四周伸向厂房。工人们在加紧地安装着剩余的设备。整齐地排列在厂房里面的各种庞大的机械设备，被从一排排天窗玻璃斜射进来的阳光照得闪闪发光。管理这些设备的精密的自动操纵装置，已分别装设在厂内的各个操作台上，电气安装工人正用电线把这些装置和作为全厂动力的主电室连接起来。在宽大的厂房里，除了电气安装工人正在进行某些细小设备的安装和调整工作外，其他工种的大部分工人已因工作结束而转到新的工作岗位。担负生产的职工已开始进入车间，他们成群地踏着光亮的瓷砖、钢砖等铺成的地面，围着机械设备精心地研究着操作技术，迎接着正式开工生产的日子的到来。
    正在进行收尾工程的职工们，为了使工程能按期或提前竣工，已展开了热烈的竣工竞赛。在竞赛中，出现了许多加速工程进度的“窍门”，如担负试车烧油工作的唐洪芳小组，在苏联专家帮助下，研究出一种新的工具，使工作效率提高十二倍，保证了局部试车的进度。安装电缆线的赵继忠小组，找到了一个套螺丝扣的“窍门”，用两天半时间完成了六天的任务。
    【新华社鞍山十三日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建的大型轧钢厂工程，已进入施工的最紧张阶段。大型轧钢厂工程从去年八月开始施工以来，到今年六月止，整个工程按建筑安装价值计算，已完成全部工程量的百分之六十一，其中技术复杂的设备基础、机械安装、筑炉、金属结构等主要工程的施工已接近完成；电气安装和工业管道安装工程的施工正在加速进行。
    建设这个工厂的广大职工们，在各个施工工地上展开了劳动竞赛。金属结构工人正加紧安装着最后一部分房架；土木建筑工人们紧接着就在架好的房架上铺设屋面。在厂房内，一部分安装工人还在安装着剩余的机械设备时，另一部分工人就在已安装完了的轧钢机旁边和各种设备的周围，用油布和沙纸展开了设备的清洗工作；电气安装工人一边紧张地安装着电气设备，一边进行着电缆的穿线和接线工作，并已局部开始了电气调整，准备为全厂机械设备局部试车时送电。在厂房外边，各工种的工人正互相配合，安装着纵横交错的各种水道、电缆管道和瓦斯管道，并修建着厂用铁路和公路。
