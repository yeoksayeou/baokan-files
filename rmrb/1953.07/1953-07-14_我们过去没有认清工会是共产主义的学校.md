    Editor's Note: After the Tianjin Daily published the self-criticism of Wang Xiuzhen, a female worker from Hengda Tobacco Factory, many trade union cadres, in connection with their past work, further criticized some of their erroneous ideas and improved their understanding. The following are three articles selected from their self-criticisms.
    Comrade Hu Yuzhen among us used to work in Hengda Tobacco Factory and served as the group leader of Wang Xiuzhen's group, so she has a relatively good understanding of her situation. Wang Xiuzhen's life was relatively hard before liberation, but her awareness was very low. She even envied the extravagant life of the exploiting class. After liberation, her wage income increased, and her life improved, so she felt that it was almost enough, that she had reached the top, and she thought only about enjoying herself all day long, and did not take national construction and group plans seriously at all. She was influenced by the bourgeois enjoyment and corrupt ideas of the old society and had serious individualism.
    However, we cannot view Wang Xiuzhen's thinking as just her personal shortcomings; our trade union workers should also be responsible for insufficient education of workers. In the past, we once mistakenly believed that trade union work had a "specific standpoint." We believed that we were elected by the workers and should seek "welfare" for the workers; as for production, that was mainly the business of the administration. Yao Mingyi among us used to be the chairman of the trade union in China Vegetable Oil Factory. Every time we engaged in production campaigns, we would first ask how much the bonus was. Because we did not clearly understand that the trade union is a "school of communism," we did not pay close attention to political education for workers in normal times. Many trade union cadres were busy buying bicycles, wool, and socks for workers all day long, turning the "school of communism" into a "welfare department." Of course, we did not pay good attention to consolidating labor discipline. This not only had an impact on production but also alienated the trade union from the masses. The economistic tendency in trade union work, neglecting communist education, directly fueled the development of some workers' individualistic and selfish ideas. The emergence of Wang Xiuzhen's thinking should be said to be a major reason for this.
    Regarding communist education, some of our comrades also have an incomplete understanding. Hu Yuzhen used to think that only talking about "from ape to man" and the history of social development was communist education, and did not realize that combining the current actual work to carry out practical political and ideological education for workers is communist education. Some trade union cadres have a compromising mentality, knowing full well that some workers violate labor discipline but thinking it is not good to manage them; some trade union cadres also want to educate the workers, but they cannot come up with a way. Taking Wang Xiuzhen as an example, it has been more than four years since liberation, and today the trade union is only now seriously educating her. In the past, when she violated labor discipline, the group leader reported it to the trade union, and the trade union only said that her awareness was low and that we could not demand too much of her. This sometimes made the workshop chairman cry, but she could not think of a solution. Since recently strengthening labor discipline education, she has quickly changed. Some people who knew her in the past were very surprised and said, "How has Little Sister San (Wang Xiuzhen is the third child) also changed?" In fact, it is very obvious that the vast majority of our workers have high awareness, and the thinking of a small number of workers is backward. As long as they are patiently and seriously educated, they will change. The problem is that we did not dare to educate, did not educate, or did not educate properly in the past, and did not fulfill the responsibility of the trade union.
    Our country's period of planned economic construction has begun. In order to industrialize the country and gradually transition to a socialist society, we need our working class to wage a more organized and more conscious struggle, and labor discipline is one of the standards of our organization and awareness. Our trade union work comrades should conscientiously implement the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, strengthen communist education for the masses of workers and staff, draw a clear line between the thinking of the working class and the non-working class, and create a kind of public opinion and habit among the masses: observing labor discipline is glorious, violating labor discipline is shameful; we must carry out criticism and self-criticism to greatly consolidate labor discipline and strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan.

    我们过去没有认清工会是共产主义的学校
    天津市国营地方工业工会联合委员会

    编者按：天津日报发表了恒大烟草厂女工王秀珍的检讨以后，许多工会干部，联系到过去的工作，进一步批判了自己的一些错误思想，提高了认识。下面是从他们的检讨中选出来的三篇。
    我们中间的胡玉珍同志过去在恒大烟草厂做工，担任过王秀珍那个小组的小组长，对她的情况比较了解。王秀珍在解放前生活是比较苦的，但觉悟很低，她甚至羡慕剥削阶级的奢侈生活。解放以后，她工资收入多了，生活好了，就感到差不多了，到了顶了，整天光想自己玩乐，把国家建设、小组计划根本没有当回事。她受了旧社会资产阶级享受腐化思想的影响，存在着严重的个人主义。
    但是，我们不能把王秀珍思想光看做她一个人的缺点，我们工会工作者对工人教育不够，也应该负责任。过去我们曾一度错误地认为工会工作有“具体立场”。我们认为自己是工人选出来的，应该给工人谋“福利”；至于搞生产，那主要是行政的事。我们中间的姚明义过去在中国植物油厂担任工会主席，每次搞生产运动，先要问奖励金有多少。由于我们对工会是“共产主义的学校”这一点认识不清，平常对工人进行政治教育抓的不紧，很多工会干部整天忙着给工人买自行车、买毛线、买袜子，把个“共产主义的学校”办成了“福利部”，当然就没有很好地注意巩固劳动纪律，这不但对生产有影响，而且使工会脱离了群众。工会工作中的经济主义倾向，忽视共产主义的教育，直接助长了某些工人的个人主义自私自利思想的发展。王秀珍思想的所以产生，应该说这也是一个主要原因。
    对于共产主义教育，我们有些同志也有不全面的理解。胡玉珍过去认为只有讲“从猿到人”，讲社会发展史，才是共产主义教育，没有了解到结合当前的实际工作，切实地对工人进行政治思想教育，就是进行共产主义教育。有的工会干部存在着迁就思想，明明知道有些工人违犯劳动纪律，却认为不好管；也有些工会干部想对工人进行教育，可是拿不出办法来。拿王秀珍来说，解放四年多，到今天工会才认真对她进行教育。过去她违犯劳动纪律，小组长反映到工会，工会只说她的觉悟低，不能要求太严格，这样有时把车间主席气哭了，也想不出个办法来。从最近加强劳动纪律教育以后，她很快有了转变。有些过去了解她的人都很惊讶说：“小三姐（王秀珍排行第三）怎么也转变了？”其实，事情很明显，我们绝大多数工人觉悟是高的，一部分工人思想落后，只要经过耐心地认真地教育，是会改变过来的，问题在于我们过去不敢教育、没有教育，或者教育得不得当，没有尽到工会的责任。
    我们国家有计划的经济建设时期开始了，为了国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会，需要我们工人阶级作更有组织更有觉悟的斗争，劳动纪律就是我们组织性和觉悟性的标准之一。我们工会工作同志们，应该认真贯彻中国工会第七次全国代表大会的决议，加强对职工群众进行共产主义的教育，划清工人阶级与非工人阶级的思想界限，在群众中造成一种舆论，一种习惯：遵守劳动纪律是光荣的，违犯劳动纪律是耻辱的；必须开展批评与自我批评，以大大地巩固劳动纪律，争取完成与超额完成国家计划。
