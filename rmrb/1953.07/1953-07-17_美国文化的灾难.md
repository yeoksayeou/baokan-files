    The United States has recently launched a large-scale "movement" to censor and destroy progressive books and periodicals. According to U.S. Senator Thomas Hennings in Congress, "The current book burning movement was ordered by the Eisenhower administration." Flames are spreading from within the United States to American libraries in Berlin, Tokyo, and elsewhere. Since March of this year, under the instigation of McCarthy, head of the Senate "Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations," and under the personal instruction of Secretary of State Dulles, 300 kinds of books, totaling about 30,000 volumes, have been banned in American libraries abroad. Some have been burned, and others have been used as raw materials for papermaking. Within the United States, this fascist atrocity of trampling on progressive books and periodicals is even more insane. The House Un-American Activities Committee has drawn up a "blacklist" of books, which includes 560 banned books. The authorities of San Antonio, Texas, and members of the local fascist organization "Women's Militia Association" have compiled a list of 600 banned books. In Brooklyn, 16 publishing houses have withdrawn 414 books from bookstores. According to representatives of library staff from various places who attended the "Freedom of Thought" committee meeting held by the American Library Association in New York, fascist organizations such as the "American Legion" openly broke into libraries across the country, blacklisted many famous works, and took them away from the library. Some were burned publicly.

    Among the books that have been censored and destroyed, the first category is the works of American progressive writers such as Theodore Dreiser, Howard Fast, and Albert Maltz. These works are the most loved by the American people and the most hated by the American rulers, and many Americans have been persecuted for reading them. The second category is books written by people whose names are on the blacklist of "disloyal" persons by various U.S. congressional intelligence organizations. Regardless of their content, all are banned, including books on physics, medicine, architecture, and sculpture. Most of these authors are American progressives or people who dare to express their desire for peace and opposition to war. The secret agents have already deprived them of their jobs and are now destroying their works. Another category does not ask who the author is, as long as the book involves the inside story of how American monopoly capitalists make money, it is forbidden. The American "Nation Weekly" reported: "The books that the authorities want to ban are not only those written by people who advocate social reform, but often even books that merely criticize our business practices cannot escape being banned." It doesn't stop there. Some world-renowned works have also been affected because they do not suit the taste of the American rulers. For example, the list of banned books published in San Antonio includes the famous scientist Einstein's "Theory of Relativity" and the Nobel Prize-winning writer Thomas Mann's "Joseph in Egypt." Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," the work of the great British writer of the 14th century, has also been banned. Cleveland has banned the reading of Apuleius' "The Golden Ass," the ancient Roman philosopher. Boston's "censor" called Shakespeare a "master of obscenity." Maupassant's works have also been banned. In the House Un-American Activities Committee's blacklist of books, even the works of Mark Twain, one of the greatest writers in American history, have been banned. Mark Twain once said during his lifetime that in the United States, "only the dead have freedom of speech, and only the dead can tell the truth." Unexpectedly, more than 40 years after his death, "the freedom of speech of the dead" has also been deprived. In addition to the above categories, there are some books that are harmed simply because someone arbitrarily adds a "crime" to it. According to the publisher of "The New York Times," Sulzberger: "Some books are banned from publication simply because they are accused of containing communist ideas, even though the accuser may never have read the books." Sulzberger cited several examples to illustrate this fact, and he also admitted: "A smokescreen of intimidation shrouds American speech and thought."

    The reactionary forces in the United States are so crazy as to treat progressive books with fire and paper shredders, which shows that the various methods they have adopted in the past to enslave and paralyze people's minds have encountered serious failures. Their increasing madness also proves their increasing decline.

    What the American monopoly capital group needs is war, pursuing maximum profits from war adventures. Therefore, they want to poison the minds of the American people and try their best to develop a "culture" characterized by advocating war and massacre, and promoting the degeneration and ignorance of the people. American monopoly capital almost controls all the propaganda tools and printing machines in the country, controls the national distribution agencies and various organizations such as "book clubs" that promote reading materials, and hires and co-opts a large number of literary minions to work for them. They produce and disseminate a quantity of harmful reading materials that they boast as "the world's number one," including all kinds of absurd "theories," which either tell Americans to be content with being enslaved or "guide" them to find a "way out" to war. For example, the United States has been particularly keen on promoting Malthus's "population theory" in recent years, repeatedly emphasizing that war and famine are the "natural laws" for reducing the world's "overpopulation." Another part is extremely boring anti-communist and anti-Soviet slanders. Still a larger part is what is called "yellow culture," which guides Americans to degeneration and ignorance, in order to carry out anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and war-mongering propaganda. From literature, movies, dramas, newspapers, radio programs to store advertisements, they are full of pornography, murder, robbery, fraud, and all kinds of bizarre detective stories. The American progressive magazine "Masses & Mainstream" listed the names of some "works" published in the United States in 1952, such as: "The Day I Died," "The Philosophy of Madness," "The Corpse with Sticky Fingers," "The Sword of Fate," "Slaughter, Madness, and the Law," and so on. These "works" were popular for a while under the hype of the American ruling group and American literary beggars. The American "Saturday Review of Literature" admitted that now "even more serious writers are immersed in these themes: sexual depravity, brutal crimes on the battlefield, and the reckless pursuit of sensory stimulation." The American ruling group hopes to fill the minds of Americans with these things, turning them into so-called "literate illiterates" and "living killing machines," so as to docilely supply them with servitude and drive.

    While developing this reactionary and decadent "culture," they have also adopted various methods to destroy the progressive forces in the American cultural circles and the upright people who demand peace and freedom. Under the economic control of American monopoly capital, the publication of progressive books is more difficult than ascending to heaven. Many American writers who are unwilling to betray their conscience are forced to change careers because their works cannot be published. Saxton, one of the most talented writers in the United States, is now working on the railroad to make a living. The political persecution suffered by American progressive cultural figures is becoming increasingly serious. The outstanding American writers Fast and Maltz have both been unjustly imprisoned. The famous film actor Chaplin was expelled and unable to return to the United States, and his early works were also banned from being shown in the United States. The world-renowned black singer Robeson was insulted and even beaten by fascist thugs everywhere. Hans Eisler, a talented composer praised by the American people, was arrested, tracked, and exiled. Now, the famous scientist Einstein has also been denounced as an "enemy of the United States" by the fascists in the U.S. Senate.

    The infamous so-called "loyalty investigation" has also affected a wide range of cultural figures. According to the estimate of American radio broadcaster Steele: "About 500,000 American writers, scientists, artists, doctors, union leaders, and general progressives have lost their jobs for adhering to their opinions and are in economic ruin." The "evidence" of many Americans' "crimes" is that he has read a Soviet book or a novel by Dreiser. A professor at the University of Oregon was fired because he said that the theories of Soviet agronomist Lysenko "may be correct." Schools have become places where American secret agents run rampant. In January of this year, three U.S. congressional intelligence organizations (the Senate "Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations," the "Domestic Security Subcommittee," and the House "Un-American Activities Committee") publicly competed to undertake the task of "comprehensively investigating" the ideology of personnel in the American education community. A reporter from a New York bourgeois newspaper reported after visiting seventy-two universities and colleges that surveillance and an atmosphere of terror were enveloping these schools; there, students could not use the words "peace," "freedom," and "liberalism" in their speech. Russell, a representative of the American Teachers Association, said: "Today, the only people who can feel safe are those who share the same views as McCarthy and McCarran (both famous fascists in the United States). Students are afraid to express their opinions on anything."

    Under the annual increase of the American military budget, the funds for culture and education are surprisingly small. Moreover, many cultural and educational institutions have also become American military research institutes and places for implementing war preparedness training and conducting war and enslavement propaganda. According to official U.S. reports, three-quarters of all scientific research appropriations in the 1953-1954 budget are used for military research. The U.S. government spends dozens of times more money directly on military research than on agricultural science research, and hundreds of times more than on medical and biological sciences. The U.S. Navy alone uses more than 200 universities to do research work for it. Last year, the U.S. government allocated more than $4 million to Columbia University for military research expenses. The task of the "Russian Research Institute" in this school is to train intelligence personnel for various U.S. government agencies in military and diplomatic aspects. Regarding this situation, Griswold, the president of Yale University, couldn't help but indignantly say that American educational institutions have trained some "barbarians" similar to those who plunged Europe into the stagnation of the Dark Ages.

    American cultural aggression against foreign countries is also being carried out on an unprecedented scale. Not to mention West Germany and Japan under American occupation, people in Latin America and other regions all the way to Britain and France have recently been loudly protesting against American cultural aggression. Bookstores in Latin American countries are filled with American yellow periodicals. American Spanish magazines, which are specifically aimed at poisoning the people of the colonies, are published in large quantities in Latin America. The First Continental Congress of Culture held in Santiago, the capital of Chile, from the end of April to the beginning of May this year, passed a resolution to protect the culture of Latin American countries and the rights of cultural workers. In Western Europe, two-thirds of French cinemas are occupied by American films. According to the Norwegian "Life News," the production of French films was squeezed and reduced by three-quarters last year. People in cities such as Paris and Marseille have established mass committees to demand the protection of domestic films and ban the dumping of American films. Due to the large-scale sale of American and American-style yellow reading materials in Britain, the Scottish Educational Institute passed a resolution on June 13 this year, requesting the government to prohibit them. The resolution stated that this reading material "completely emphasizes lust and violence" and has a harmful impact on young people.

    At the same time, the United States is preventing cultural exchanges between people of all countries. It does not allow progressive cultural figures and progressive books and periodicals from various countries to enter the United States; nor does it allow American progressive cultural workers to contact the cultural circles abroad. It also forces many other countries to adopt the same policy as it, creating barriers to world cultural exchange and hindering mutual understanding between people of all countries, in order to promote policies aimed at maintaining international tensions.

    Peace-loving people all over the world love human culture. The Soviet Union has published tens of millions of copies of literary works by American writers in dozens of languages. The Chinese people cherish the works of outstanding writers from the United States and other countries as much as they cherish their own national culture. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference last year, the Continental Congress of Culture this year, and the recent World Peace Council meeting in Budapest have all passed resolutions on promoting cultural exchanges between people of all countries. This resolution has been supported by a wide range of people around the world, including upright people in the United States.

    The will of the American people to develop their own culture and make it conducive to the cause of peace cannot be destroyed by any fascist persecution. More and more events happening in the United States prove this. For example, a teacher at Manhattan High School in the United States was subpoenaed by the Senate Domestic Security Subcommittee in April this year and asked to explain his "communist relationship." He refused to answer this unwarranted question and wrote a letter to Einstein. Einstein replied in a letter on June 16: "The problem facing American intellectuals now is an extremely serious problem. The reactionary politicians in the United States are trying their best to shout about foreign dangers in front of the public, making the public suspicious of all activities in the intellectual community. They have succeeded so far, and now they are going to ban freedom of teaching and deprive those who do not obey their orders of their positions." He called on American intellectuals to take "non-cooperation" measures to deal with those U.S. congressional committee subpoenas. Immediately afterwards, six teachers at Manhattan School would rather be dismissed than succumb to the fascist forces in the United States. This is exactly what the American writer Fast said: "We will never surrender to fascism, never surrender to war psychosis, to the crazy profit-seeking delusions of the atomic maniacs. There is a great and lofty desire for truth and freedom in the United States, and our people are only beginning the struggle for peace and freedom."

    美国文化的灾难
    李高
    美国最近发动了一个大规模的查禁和销毁进步书刊的“运动”。据美国参议员汤玛斯·汉宁在国会中说：“目前的焚书运动，是艾森豪威尔政府下令做的。”火焰从美国国内烧到了柏林、东京等地的美国图书馆中。自今年三月以来，在参院“常设调查小组委员会”头子麦卡锡的策动和国务卿杜勒斯的亲自指示下，美国国外图书馆中书籍被查禁的已有三百种，约三万册，其中一部分已被焚毁，还有一些则做了造纸的原料。在美国国内各地，这种蹂躏进步书刊的法西斯暴行更为疯狂。众议院非美活动调查委员会拟定了一份书籍“黑名单”，其中禁书达五百六十种。得克萨斯州圣安东尼奥城当局和当地法西斯组织“女民兵协会”成员所定的禁书目录，包括书籍六百种。在布鲁克林，十六家发行所从书店中抽回了四百十四种书籍。据出席美国图书馆协会在纽约举行的“思想自由”委员会会议的各地图书馆职员代表报告，“美国退伍军人团”等法西斯组织，公开闯进各地图书馆，把许多名著列入黑名单，从书库中劫走，有的则公开焚毁。
    在被查禁和销毁的书籍里，第一类是西奥多·德莱塞、霍华德·法斯特、艾伯特·马尔兹等美国进步作家的作品。这些作品是美国人民所最喜爱而为美国统治者所最痛恨的，有许多美国人因阅读这些作品受过迫害。第二类是美国国会各特务组织认为
    “不忠诚”的黑名单上有名字的人所写的书，不问其内容如何一律被禁，其中包括有关于物理、医药、建筑、雕刻等方面的书籍。这些作者大多数是美国的进步人士，或者敢于表示自己要求和平、反对战争意愿的人。特务们早就已使他们丧失职业，现在又销毁他们的著作。另一类则不问作者是谁，只要书中涉及了美国垄断资本家们赚钱黑幕的就要犯禁。美国“民族周刊”报道说：“当局要禁止的书不仅是那些主张社会改革的人写的书，而且往往只是批评我们商界习惯的书也免不了被禁。”还不止此，有一些世界闻名的著作，因为不合美国统治者的口味，也被殃及了。例如圣安东尼奥城公布的禁书名单中，包括了著名的科学家爱因斯坦的“相对论”和曾获得诺贝尔奖金的作家汤玛斯·曼的“约瑟夫在埃及”，英国十四世纪的大作家乔叟的作品“坎特伯雷的故事”也被禁了。克利夫兰已禁止阅读古罗马哲学家亚普利亚斯的“金驴子”。波士顿的“检查官”把莎士比亚称为“淫猥大师”。莫泊桑的作品也被禁止了。在美国众议院“非美活动调查委员会”的书籍黑名单中，连美国历史上最伟大的作家之一马克·吐温的作品也有被禁的。马克·吐温生前曾说，在美国，“只有死人才有言论自由，只有死人才能诉说真理”。想不到当他死去四十多年之后，“死人的言论自由”也被剥夺了。除开上述几类之外，还有一些书籍则仅仅因为被人随意给它加上“罪名”就被殃害。据“纽约时报”发行人苏兹贝格透露：“有些书籍仅仅因为被别人指责含有共产主义思想，就被禁止发行，虽然控告人也许从来没有看过这些书籍。”苏兹贝格曾引用好些例子说明这种事实，他也承认：“恐吓的烟幕笼罩着美国的言论与思想。”
    美国的反动势力疯狂到要用火和碎纸机来对待进步书籍，这说明他们过去所采用的奴役和麻痹人心的种种办法已遭遇了严重失败。他们的更加疯狂也证明了他们的更加没落。
    美国垄断资本集团所需要的是战争，从战争冒险中追求最大限度的利润。因此，他们就要毒害美国人民的思想，竭力发展以鼓吹战争和屠杀、促使人民堕落和愚昧为其主要特征的“文化”。美国垄断资本几乎掌握了全国所有的宣传工具和印刷机器，控制了全国的发行机构和各种推销读物的“读书会”之类的组织，雇用和笼络了大量御用文人为他们工作。他们制造和散播了他们自夸为“世界第一”的数量的有害读物，其中有形形色色的荒谬绝伦的“理论”，不是叫美国人安于被奴役的现状就是“指导”他们向战争找“出路”。例如美国近年特别热中地宣传马尔萨斯的“人口论”，翻来覆去地强调战争和饥馑死亡是减少世界“人口过多”的“自然法则”。另一部分是穷极无聊的反共、反苏的谰言。还有更大一部分是被称为“黄色文化”的，引导美国人走向堕落愚昧的东西，以进行反苏、反共和鼓动战争的宣传。从文学、电影、戏剧、报刊、广播节目一直到商店广告里，都充满了色情、凶杀、抢劫、欺诈和种种离奇怪诞的侦探故事。美国进步杂志“群众与主流”曾列举一九五二年美国出版的一些“作品”的名字，它们是：“我死的日子”、“疯狂的哲学”、“有着黏滑的手指的尸体”、“命运之剑”、“屠杀、疯狂与法律”等等。这些“作品”在美国统治集团和美国文丐们的吹捧下，风行一时。美国“星期六文学评论报”承认：现在“甚至比较严肃的作家也沉迷在这些题材中：性的堕落、战场上的残暴罪行和不顾一切地追求感官的挑逗”。美国统治集团就希望以这些东西填满美国人的头脑，使他们变成所谓“识字的文盲”和“活的杀人机器”，从而驯顺地供其奴役和驱使。
    在发展这种反动和堕落的“文化”的同时，他们又采取了各种各样的方式来摧残美国文化界的进步力量和要求和平与自由的正直人士。在美国垄断资本的经济控制之下，进步书籍的出版比登天还难。许多不愿辱没自己的良知的美国作家，因为作品无法出版而被迫改业。美国最有才能的作家之一萨克斯特，现在在铁路上做工，以维持生活。美国进步文化人士遭受的政治迫害，日益严重。美国优秀的作家法斯特、马尔兹等人都曾入过冤狱。著名的电影演员卓别林被摈斥不能回美国，他的早年作品在美国也被禁止上演了。名闻世界的黑人歌唱家罗伯逊到处受到法西斯恶棍的凌辱甚至殴打。美国人民交口称誉的天才作曲家汉斯·艾斯勒被逮捕、追踪和放逐。现在，著名科学家爱因斯坦，也被美国参议院的法西斯分子指斥为“美国的敌人”了。
    臭名远扬的所谓“忠诚调查”，也殃及广泛的文化界人士。据美国无线电广播员斯梯尔估计：“大概有五十万美国的作家、科学家、艺术家、医生、工会领袖和一般进步人士由于坚持他们的意见而失了业，并且陷于经济毁灭的困境。”许多美国人“犯罪”的“证据”是他读过一本苏联书或者德莱塞的小说。俄勒冈大学一位教授被解聘，原因是他说苏联农学家李森科的学说“也许是正确的”。学校成了美国特务人员横行无忌之所。今年一月，美国国会的三个特务组织（参院“常设调查小组委员会”、
    “国内安全小组委员会”和众院“非美活动调查委员会”）公开争抢着要担任“全面调查”美国教育界人员思想的工作。纽约资产阶级报纸记者在访问了七十二个大学和学院后报道说：钉梢和恐怖气氛笼罩着这些学校；在那里，学生们不能在言谈中使用“和平”、“自由”、“自由主义”的字眼。美国教师协会的一位代表罗塞尔说：“今天自己能感到安全的人，就只有那些与麦卡锡和麦卡伦（都是美国出名的法西斯分子）抱同一意见的人了。学生们对什么事都怕发表意见了。”
    在美国军事预算逐年增加下，文化教育经费是小得惊人的。而且许多文化教育机构也已变成美国的军事研究所和实施备战训练、进行战争与奴化宣传的场所。据美国官方的报告，一九五三—一九五四年预算中的全部科学研究拨款有四分之三用于军事研究。美国政府直接花在军事研究上的经费比花在农业科学研究上的经费要大几十倍，比花在医药和生物科学上的费用要大几百倍。仅美国海军部就利用了两百多所大学替它做研究工作。去年，美国政府拨给哥伦比亚大学四百万美元以上作为军事研究的费用。这个学校里的“俄文研究所”，任务是给美国政府各机关训练军事方面和外交方面的情报人员。对于这种情况，美国耶鲁大学校长格里斯瓦德也不禁愤懑地说：美国的教育机关训练了一些类似那些曾把欧洲投入黑暗时代停滞状态的“野蛮人”。
    美国对外的文化侵略，也以空前的规模进行着。在美国占领下的西德和日本不用说了，在拉丁美洲和其他地区一直到英、法等国的人民，最近都在大声疾呼地反对美国的文化侵略。拉丁美洲各国的书店里挤满了美国的黄色书刊。美国专以毒害殖民地人民为直接目的的西班牙文杂志，在拉丁美洲大量地出版。今年四月末到五月初在智利首都圣地亚哥举行的第一届美洲大陆文化大会，通过了保卫拉丁美洲国家的文化与文化工作者权利的决议。在西欧，法国的电影院有三分之二被美国影片所霸占。据挪威“生活报”报道，去年法国影片产量被排挤得减少了四分之三。巴黎、马赛等城市人民都建立了群众性的委员会，要求保护国产片，禁止美国影片倾销。由于美国的和美国式的黄色读物在英国大量销售，今年六月十三日苏格兰教育学会通过了一项决议，要求政府加以禁止。决议案中说：这种读物“完全在强调色欲和暴力”，对少年发生有害的影响。
    同时，美国又阻止各国人民之间的文化交流。它不许各国的进步的文化人士和进步书刊进入美国国内；也不许美国的进步文化工作者和国外的文化界取得联系。它还迫使别的许多国家也和它采取同样的政策，造成世界文化交流的壁垒，阻碍各国人民之间的相互了解，以便推行旨在维持国际间的紧张局势的政策。
    全世界热爱和平的人民都热爱人类的文化。苏联用几十种语言出版了数千万册美国作家的文学作品。中国人民如同珍视自己的民族文化一样珍视美国和其他国家的优秀作家的作品。去年的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议、今年的美洲大陆文化大会和最近世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议上，都通过了关于促进各国人民之间的文化交流的决议。这个决议，得到了世界广泛人士的支持，包括美国正直人士在内。
    美国人民要求发展自己的文化，使它有利于和平事业的意志，是任何法西斯迫害所摧残不了的。在美国发生的越来越多的事件，证明了这一点。例如，美国曼哈顿高等学校一位教师今年四月间受到参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯，要他说明他的“共产党关系”，他拒绝回答这个莫须有的问题，并写信给爱因斯坦。爱因斯坦在六月十六日写信答复他说：“美国知识分子现在所面临的问题是极其严重的问题。美国的反动政客们极力在公众面前叫嚷外来的危险，使公众怀疑知识界的一切活动。他们迄今得逞，现在进而要取缔教学自由，剥夺那些不唯命是听的人的地位”。他号召美国知识分子采取“不合作”办法来对付那些美国国会委员会的传讯。紧接着，曼哈顿学校就有六位教师宁愿被解聘也不向美国的法西斯势力屈服。这正如美国作家法斯特所说的：“我们绝不向法西斯屈服，绝不向战争精神病、向原子狂者集团的疯狂的谋取利润的妄想屈服。在美国有着向往真理与自由的伟大崇高的愿望，我们的人民仅仅才开始争取和平与自由的斗争哩。”
