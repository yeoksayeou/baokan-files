    Mayakovsky and Us
    ——Commemorating the Sixtieth Anniversary of Mayakovsky's Birth
    He Qifang

    "Translating poetry is a difficult task, especially translating my poetry."① Mayakovsky once said this. However, through translations that weren't exactly ideal, and some that were re-translations or abridged versions, Mayakovsky's works had long had a significant impact on China's young revolutionary poetry. We have loved a wide variety of poetry; but among modern poets, the one who most excites us is none other than Mayakovsky.

    Language, rhythm, and other subtle aspects of poetry are always compromised by translation. However, the flame-like revolutionary passion in Mayakovsky's works, and his highly original imagery and methods of expression, can still create a strong impression even after translation.

    As early as 1940, when we were in Yan'an, we read the abridged translation of Mayakovsky's "Good!". What an inspiring work it was!

    I praise
    	the present of the motherland,
    I praise threefold
    	the future of the motherland.

    This sounded very much like a cheer coming from our own hearts. This was not only because we regarded the victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union as the hope and example for the people of the world, but also because we cherished the same love for the liberated areas of China at that time and for the future of China. Although we were then living in cave dwellings on the mountains, and in order to overcome material difficulties, we sometimes had to use simple production tools such as hoes and sickles to cultivate wasteland and harvest grain on the high mountaintops, we were working so happily, dreaming, and firmly believing in the bright future of our own motherland. Mayakovsky's poem was very charming. As we read it, it was as if we were walking on the streets of Moscow, seeing the blue velvet-like sky during the day, and the glass windows of shops and bookstores illuminated by lights at night. When his praise shifted from the city to the countryside, we seemed to feel the breeze of spring and smell the fragrance emanating from the woods...

    High revolutionary enthusiasm, this is the first prominent characteristic that we felt from Mayakovsky's poems. He was a singer with "boiling blood all over his body."② He was "first and foremost a poet-agitator, a poet-propagandist."③ He fully realized what he had declared: "I dedicate all the resounding power of my poetry to you, the attacking class."④ This is the fundamental reason why he became a great poet of the proletarian revolutionary era.

    His firm belief in and praise for the victory of socialism, his love and pride for the Soviet motherland, his fervent praise for the Party and Lenin, and his sharp exposure of imperialist countries and their colonial policies are all concrete manifestations of his high revolutionary enthusiasm. His cheers for the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle were also inspiring. In March 1927, he was reciting his poems in the city of Yaroslavl north of Moscow, and when he heard the news that the workers' uprising in Shanghai had occupied Shanghai, he was very excited and wrote a lyric poem titled "The Best Poem." He said: All moving poems cannot compare, any greatest poetic success cannot compare with this simple news report:

    A poet must have this kind of enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause of the working class around the world in order to write very moving revolutionary poems. Mayakovsky, with the sensitivity and enthusiasm characteristic of a talented revolutionary artist, drew on a wide variety of poetic themes from real life at home and abroad, so that even the revolutionary art theory was expressed in his poems. "Poetry and song – these are bombs and banners," this popular and inflammatory explanation of literature and art as tools of class struggle has become the guiding principle for the authors of Chinese revolutionary poetry. Although only a small part of Mayakovsky's poems have been translated into Chinese, we still feel from their diverse content another characteristic of his works, the unusually broad and important themes.

    Mayakovsky once said that he himself "is really also a factory."⑤ He worked ten to eighteen hours a day. But his regular output was only eight to ten lines of poetry a day.⑥ When he was conceiving his long poem "Lenin," he was so dedicated: "He cut off conversations with anyone, and in order not to be disturbed by other affairs, he moved to a suburban villa and devoted himself to conceiving it alone for three months."⑦ He himself once compared writing poetry to the mining of radium, saying that it takes a year of labor to mine one gram of radium, and that writing poetry sometimes requires mining a thousand tons of word ore for one word.⑧ He said: "It is very easy to write poems that cannot stimulate or inspire anyone: 'Forward, forward, you working people!' 'The Young Communist League comrades built a great fortress.' 'The red flag flutters high, like a flame,' and so on. These poems are very popular, but they are forgotten the next day." He said that, contrary to this, "I often try to move someone." "Therefore, my twenty years of literary work is really a literary wrestling match."⑨ He was never satisfied with his already achieved successes. He always strictly demanded that the quality of his works continue to improve. In 1929, he said: "I want to move forward step by step. If someone says to me: Mayakovsky writes very well, he wrote a good work last year, and the work he wrote this year is just as good, in my opinion, this is very bad."⑩ In the preface to a book, he once said: "I abandon what has already been done, only after I have crossed over myself, do I publish a new book."? It is precisely because of this very intense and serious labor that Mayakovsky achieved the glorious achievements mentioned in his last poem "At the Top of My Voice":

    I want to
    	raise up like a Bolshevik Party card
    a whole hundred volumes
    	of my
    Party works.

    "This is 'life' in an extreme manifestation of life,"? Lunacharsky praised him after Mayakovsky's death. In ordinary words, this is genius – genius achieved through long-term, tremendous labor. Genius is not possible for everyone; however, Mayakovsky's high revolutionary enthusiasm, the breadth and importance of the themes in his works, and his intense and serious labor in writing are something that every literary worker can and should learn. High revolutionary enthusiasm cannot be produced from subjective imagination; it comes from long-term revolutionary training and revolutionary practice. But with high revolutionary enthusiasm, it can in turn have such an effect, making it easy for us to obtain rich and important poetic themes from our lives and our era, or to put it more precisely, making it easy for us to generate an impulse to write poetry for these themes. And to shape these themes into successful works of art, it is necessary to have a high level of artistic accomplishment and to undergo intense and serious labor.

    In January of this year, the Soviet Writers' Union and the Gorky Institute of World Literature convened a meeting to discuss some basic issues in Mayakovsky's works. The meeting criticized the errors in the research on Mayakovsky, advocated a comprehensive and historical approach to studying past writers, provided a multi-faceted explanation of Mayakovsky's achievements, and pointed out that this achievement was not achieved overnight, but went through several stages of development. Our theoretical critics should learn from this meeting and its summary, and criticize the one-sided and anti-historical tendencies existing in China's literary criticism and literary research work. And our creators, especially poetry writers, should take Mayakovsky's giant-like creative activities and contributions as an example to spur themselves on. In order to summarize the discussion on Mayakovsky, the editorial department of the Soviet "Pravda" published a special article. There is a passage in this article:

    Mayakovsky's tradition, obliges us to continuously improve the ideological and artistic level of Soviet poetry. The current situation of poetry creation, deeply arouses the inner anxiety of the Soviet people. Recently, there are almost no exciting masterpieces, no broad epic works, lyrical poetry, as usual, is shallow, only circling within some unimportant themes, and has not reached a huge artistic generalization. But, how many of those mediocre, lifeless, listless poems that appear in the posture of onlookers and without enthusiasm! These poems can only make people feel very dissatisfied.?

    It is also very appropriate to use these words to criticize our current poetry creation. Although Chinese revolutionary poetry is young and does not yet have a great poet like Mayakovsky, some talented authors have emerged and written some moving works. However, in recent years, there have been too few good works, and shoddy work and lack of enthusiasm have become a popular disease in the current poetry creation. This kind of work completely violates the excellent tradition of concise writing, perfect form, and profound emotion of those great poets of ancient China, and is precisely the kind of poems that Mayakovsky said are very easy to write and cannot stimulate or inspire anyone. This is very worrying. Because there are too few good poems and too many bad poems, it can make society indifferent to poetry, and this social indifference can in turn make poetry creation more depressed. Let us, in commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of Mayakovsky's birth, use his poems to inspire us and urge us to change the current situation of poetry creation:

    Let us have more poets,
    	good poets,
    		different poets!

    马雅可夫斯基和我们
    ——纪念马雅可夫斯基诞生六十周年
    何其芳
    “翻译诗是一件艰难的事，尤其是翻译我的诗。”①马雅可夫斯基曾经这样说过。然而，通过并不怎样理想的翻译，而且有些还是重译或者节译，马雅可夫斯基的作品却早就对中国的年轻的革命诗歌发生了显著的影响。我们爱好过多种多样的诗歌；但在现代的诗人中，最能激动我们的不是别人，正是马雅可夫斯基。
    语言，节奏，以及诗歌中另外一些微妙的东西，经过翻译总是要受到损害的。然而，马雅可夫斯基的作品里面火焰一般的革命热情，非常富于独创性的形象和表现方法，却经过翻译仍然能够造成强烈的印象。
    还是一九四○年我们在延安的时候，我们读到了马雅可夫斯基的“好！”的节译。那是多么鼓舞人的作品呵！
    我赞美
      祖国的现在，
    我三倍赞美
      祖国的将来。
    这很像是从我们自己的心里发生的欢呼。这不仅因为我们把苏联的社会主义建设的胜利当作世界人民的希望和榜样，而且因为我们对于当时的中国的解放区和中国的将来怀抱着同样的热爱。尽管我们当时住的还是近于穴居的山上的窑洞，而且为了克服物质困难，我们有时还要用锄头和镰刀那样一些简单的生产工具到高高的山顶上去开荒和割谷子，然而我们却是那样欢快地工作着，并且梦想着，坚信着我们自己祖国的美好的明天。马雅可夫斯基这篇诗是很迷人的。我们读着它，好像走到了莫斯科的街头，看见了白天的蓝绒一样的天空，夜晚的灯火照耀着的商店和书店的玻璃窗橱。当他的歌颂从都市转到乡村的时候，我们好像感到了春天的微风的吹拂，嗅到了从树林中发出的香气………
    高度的革命热情，这是我们从马雅可夫斯基的诗歌首先感到的鲜明的特点。他是一个“全身血液沸腾”的歌者②。他“首先是一个诗人鼓动者，一个诗人宣传家”③。他完全做到了他所宣言的：“我把我所有的诗人的响亮的力量都献给你，进攻的阶级”④。这正是他成为无产阶级革命时代的伟大的诗人的根本原因。
    他对于社会主义的胜利的坚信和赞美，他对于苏维埃祖国的热爱和自豪，他对于党和列宁的热烈的歌颂，他对于帝国主义国家及其殖民地政策的尖锐的暴露，都是他的高度的革命热情的具体表现。他对于中国人民的革命斗争的胜利的欢呼也是令人感奋的。一九二七年三月，他在莫斯科北边的雅洛斯拉夫城朗诵他的诗，听见了上海的工人起义占领了上海的消息，他非常兴奋，写了一首题目叫做“最好的诗”的抒情诗。他说：一切动人的诗歌都不能比，任何最大的诗歌的成功都比不了这简单的报上的消息：
    一个诗人，是必须有这种对于全世界工人阶级的革命事业的热忱，然后才可能写出很感动人的革命诗歌的。马雅可夫斯基以天才的革命艺术家所特有的敏感和热情，从国内国外的现实生活吸取了多种多样的诗的题材，以至革命的艺术理论也在他的诗里得到了表现。“诗和歌——这就是炸弹和旗帜”，这个通俗而又富有煽动性地解释了文艺是阶级斗争的工具的名句，已经成了中国革命诗歌作者们的努力的纲领。虽然马雅可夫斯基的诗歌译成中文的还只是很少一部分，我们仍然从它们的如此多方面的内容感到了他的作品的又一个特点，题材异常广阔而且重要。
    马雅可夫斯基曾经说他自己“实在也是座工厂”⑤。他每天工作十小时到十八小时。但他的经常产量却不过每天八行至十行诗⑥。他在构思他的长诗“列宁”的时候是这样专心致志：“他断绝了和任何人谈话，并且为了不被其他事务所打扰，曾迁往郊外别墅，独自一人在那里潜心构思三个月。”⑦他自己曾经把写诗比譬为镭的开采，说开采一克镭要一年的劳动，而写诗有时为了一个字要采一千吨的字矿⑧。他说：“写那种不能刺激鼓舞任何人的诗是非常容易的：‘前进，再前进，你，劳动的人们！’‘青年团同志建造了一个伟大的堡垒。’‘红旗高高飘扬，仿佛一团火焰’等等。这些诗被人很喜欢的，而第二天就被忘掉了。”他说他和这相反，“我时常企图打动什么人”。“因此我文艺工作的二十年，实实在在是一场文艺的角力比赛”⑨。他从不以自己已经达到的成就为满足。他总是严格地要求他的作品的质量不断地提高。一九二九年他曾经说：“我要一步一步地前进。如果有人对我说：马雅可夫斯基写得很好，他去年写了一部好作品，他今年写的一部作品也和那一样好，按照我的意见，这就是很坏。”⑩在一本书的序文上他又曾经这样说：“我抛开已经作过的事情，只是在我跨过我自己之后，我才出版一本新书。”?正是由于这种十分紧张十分严肃的劳动，马雅可夫斯基才达到了如像在他的最后一篇诗“放大嗓子唱”里面所说的那样光荣的成就：
    我要
    像举起布尔什维克的党证一样
    举起整整一百本
    我的
    党的著作。
    “这是生命的一个极度表现中的‘生命’，”?卢那卡尔斯基在马雅可夫斯基逝世以后曾经这样称赞他。用普通的话说，这就是天才——以长期的巨大的劳动来完成的天才，天才不可能人人都是；然而，马雅可夫斯基的高度的革命热情，他的作品的题材的广阔和重要，他在写作上的紧张的严肃的劳动，却是我们每一个文艺工作者都可以学习也应当学习的。高度的革命热情不可能从主观想像中产生，它来源于长期的革命锻炼，革命实践。但有了高度的革命热情，它又可以反过来发生这样的作用，使我们从我们的生活和我们的时代容易得到丰富的重要的诗歌题材，或者说得精确一点，使我们对于这些题材容易产生一种写作诗歌的冲动。而要以这些题材来塑造出成功的艺术品，却又必须有高度的艺术修养而且经过紧张的严肃的劳动。
    今年一月，苏联作家协会和高尔基世界文学研究院为了讨论马雅可夫斯基作品中的某些基本问题，曾经召集过一次会议。这次会议批评了关于马雅可夫斯基的研究中的错误，提倡了全面地历史地研究过去的作家的方法，对马雅可夫斯基的成就作了多方面的说明，并且指出这种成就并非一蹴而至，而是经过了几个阶段的发展。我们的理论批评工作者应该从这次会议及其总结中学习，对中国的文艺批评和文艺研究工作中存在着的片面的反历史的倾向进行批评。而我们的创作家，特别是诗歌作者，更应该以马雅可夫斯基的巨人式的创作活动和贡献为榜样来鞭策自己。为了总结关于马雅可夫斯基的讨论，苏联的“真理报”编辑部发表过一篇专论。这篇专论中有这样一段话：
    马雅可夫斯基的传统，责成我们不断地提高苏
    联诗歌的思想和艺术水平。目前诗歌创作的情
    况，深深引起苏联人民的内心的焦虑。近来几乎
    见不到激动人心的杰作，没有广阔的史诗般的作
    品，抒情诗，照例是浅薄的，只在一些无关紧要
    的主题内打圈子，而且没有达到巨大的艺术的概
    括。但是，那种平庸乏味，萎靡不振，以旁观者
    姿态出现的毫无热情的诗，又是何其多呵！这些
    诗只能令人十分感到不满意。?
    借用这些话来批评我们目前的诗歌创作，也是很适合的。中国的革命诗歌，虽然年纪很轻，虽然还没有马雅可夫斯基那样的大诗人，也曾出现过一些有才能的作者，写出过一些动人的作品。然而，近几年来，好作品实在太少了，粗制滥造和没有热情，已经成了目前诗歌创作上的流行病。这种作品完全违背了中国古代的那些大诗人的文字精炼，形式完美而且感情深厚的优良传统，而正是马雅可夫斯基所说的那种非常容易写的不能刺激鼓舞任何人的诗。这是很可忧虑的。因为好诗太少，坏诗太多，可以使社会对于诗歌冷淡起来，而这种社会的冷淡又可以反过来使诗歌创作更消沉。让我们在纪念马雅可夫斯基诞生六十周年的时候，以他的诗句来鼓舞我们，来督促我们改变目前的诗歌创作情况吧：
    让我们有更多的诗人，
    好的诗人，
        各种不同的诗人！
