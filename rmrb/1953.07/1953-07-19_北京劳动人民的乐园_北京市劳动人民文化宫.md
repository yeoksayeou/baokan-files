Beijing Laboring People's Paradise
—Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace

In the heart of Beijing, within the red walls east of the magnificent Tiananmen Square, amidst a lush landscape of evergreen pines, cypresses, wisteria, and green willows, stand several ancient buildings, compactly arranged and refreshingly open. This is the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace—the paradise for the capital's working people.

It was originally the imperial ancestral temple of the Ming and Qing dynasties, formerly known as the "Taimiao" (Imperial Ancestral Temple). After liberation, this ancient temple underwent tremendous changes. Weeds were cleared, and ball fields and open-air theaters were built on the barren land. On May 1, 1950, the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace was officially established here. The plaque with Chairman Mao's inscription "Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace" is prominently displayed above its main gate.

In this beautiful paradise, various activities are regularly held to educate the working people. Upon entering the Cultural Palace, one can see a large glass showcase, the honor roll. It regularly publishes photos and deeds of outstanding workers from various factories and mines in Beijing. To provide production technology education to the working masses, the Cultural Palace recently opened training classes for electricians and foundry workers. In the past three years, 43 large-scale exhibitions have been held in the Cultural Palace's golden halls, covering topics such as achievements in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, promotion of Sino-Soviet friendship, introduction to the history of the Chinese workers' movement, and introduction of advanced production experiences. There have also been national exhibitions on railways, petroleum, coal mines, and drama. Brotherly countries such as the Soviet Union, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Vietnam, and the German Democratic Republic have also held exhibitions here to introduce various aspects of their countries to the Chinese people. An Indian art exhibition has also been held here. In the past three years, more than 3.8 million people have visited various exhibitions, and the capital's working people have gained valuable knowledge from them. The Cultural Palace also regularly holds various meaningful lectures to promote political and current affairs among the working people, disseminate scientific knowledge, and promote advanced production experiences. National model workers Zhao Guoyou, Tian Guiying, Liang Jun, Liu Yingyuan, and some of the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning from Korea have all given reports to the capital's working people here.

People who have visited here in the past are amazed at the changes in recent years. The eastern side of the Cultural Palace, once the overgrown East Woods, has been transformed into a smooth open-air dance floor. This newly built cultural garden with more than 7,000 square meters of cement surface is the largest collective dance venue in the city. Every holiday or festival evening, workers, students, soldiers, and government cadres gather in groups, dancing and singing to rhythmic music. The evergreen woods are filled with a joyful and youthful atmosphere. To the west, adjacent to the magnificent main hall, is the Labor Theater, a new and tall building. With more than 3,000 seats, art lovers among the workers regularly perform their own programs, using artistic forms to express the creative activities of the working class in production. One can also often see performances by major professional artistic groups in the country. Mei Lanfang, Guo Lanying, and other famous Chinese actors have performed for the workers here. Art troupes from various people's democratic countries visiting China have also given wonderful performances to the capital's workers here. In the past three years, more than 450 performances have been held here, with an audience of more than 1.4 million people. To cultivate backbone members of amateur cultural and artistic activities among the working people, there is an amateur art school with five departments: literature, drama, music, fine arts, and dance. There are also amateur art groups such as dance teams, orchestras, and choirs. There are also special reports on literature and art and "Singing Together" activities. Literary and art workers from various professional artistic units in the capital often participate in these activities. Many workers with artistic talent, after being discovered here, have the opportunity to be introduced to professional schools for further study.

In the northwest corner of the Cultural Palace, there is a stadium that can accommodate more than 4,000 spectators. Not long ago, this place was still covered with weeds. Now, it has been built into the largest ball field with nighttime lighting equipment in the city. Not only do professional basketball and volleyball teams regularly give outstanding performances for the workers in the stadium, but amateur teams from various factories also constantly hold friendly matches here. In basketball alone, there are more than 630 amateur workers' teams with more than 7,000 players connected to this place. The Cultural Palace also has a large-scale workers' amateur basketball and volleyball joint team, with outstanding athletes from more than 90 factories participating in this joint team. The basketball team of this joint team is the most outstanding amateur team in the capital. In the 1952 Beijing Sports Competition, the Cultural Palace Workers' Amateur Basketball Team won the basketball championship. However, many of the members of this championship team were "outsiders" who did not know how to play ball one or two years ago!

What the capital's working people find most unforgettable are the garden parties held by the Cultural Palace during major festivals such as National Day and International Labor Day. On those days, workers from various industrial areas in the suburbs and working people living in various parts of the capital invariably come in festive attire from all directions. In the Labor Theater, in the stadium, in the amusement hall, and on the river in the back garden, there are wonderful performances or pleasant games. At night, beautiful lanterns composed of colored lights appear in the verdant pines and cypresses, illuminating people so beautifully and youthfully. The lives of the working people in the capital after liberation are becoming more and more joyful! With the development and improvement of production, they will be even more joyful and happy!

    北京劳动人民的乐园
    ——北京市劳动人民文化宫
    新华社记者    张新辰
    在北京的中心地带，巍峨壮丽的天安门东侧的红墙内，一片苍松翠柏、紫藤绿柳丛中，矗立着几座布局紧凑而爽朗的古代建筑。这就是北京市劳动人民文化宫——首都劳动人民的乐园。
    它原来是明、清两代的皇室家庙，旧称“太庙”。解放以后这座古老的庙宇，发生了巨大的变化，杂草清除了，荒地上建筑了球场、露天剧场。一九五○年五月一日北京市劳动人民文化宫在这里正式成立了。毛主席题字的“北京市劳动人民文化宫”的匾额，显著地高挂在它的大门上面。
    这个美丽的乐园里，现在经常有各种向劳动人民进行教育的活动。一进文化宫大门，就可以看到一个大型玻璃橱窗的光荣榜。那里定期公布北京各厂矿企业的优秀工作者像片和他们的事迹。为了向工人群众进行生产技术教育，最近文化宫开办了电工和铸工的训练班。三年来，在文化宫金黄色的大殿里举行了四十三次大型的展览会，内容有抗美援朝的成就、中苏友好的宣传、中国工人运动史的介绍、先进生产经验的介绍等；也有全国铁路、石油、煤矿、戏剧等展览。苏联、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、越南、德意志民主共和国等兄弟国家，也都曾在这里举办展览会，向中国人民介绍他们国家各方面的情况。在这里也曾举行过一次印度文艺展览会。三年来共有三百八十多万人到这里参观了各种展览会，首都劳动人民从这里获得了各种宝贵的知识。文化宫还经常举行各种有意义的演讲，向劳动人民进行政治时事宣传，传播科学知识，推广先进生产经验。全国著名的劳动模范赵国有、田桂英、梁军、刘英源以及每次归国的志愿军代表们中的一部分人，都在这里向首都劳动人民作过报告。
    过去来过这里的人，都惊叹这几年来的变化。文化宫东侧，曾经是荒草丛生的东树林里变成了一座光滑的露天舞场，这片新建的七千多平方公尺水泥地面的文化园，是全市最大的集体歌舞场所。每逢假日或节日的晚上，工人们、学生们、兵士们以及机关干部们成群结队地，随着有节奏的音乐，在这儿跳着，唱着。常青的树林里充满了愉快和年青的气氛。西面，和雄伟的大殿相毗连的新的高大建筑物是劳动剧场。在这里有三千多座位，工人中的艺术爱好者们经常演出自己的节目，用艺术的形式来表现工人阶级在生产中的创造性的活动。这里也经常可以看到国内各大专业文艺团体的演出。梅兰芳、郭兰英等我国著名演员都曾在这里为工人们演出过。各人民民主国家来我国访问的文艺团体，也都先后在这里向首都工人作过精彩表演。三年来这里共举行了四百五十多次演出，观众达一百四十多万人。为了培养劳动人民业余文化艺术的骨干分子，这里有一所拥有文学、戏剧、音乐、美术和舞蹈等五个系的业余艺术学校；还有舞蹈队、管弦乐团、合唱团等业余艺术团体。这里还有关于文艺的专题报告和“大家唱”等活动。首都各专业文艺单位的文艺工作者们，都经常参加这些活动。许多有艺术天才的工人在这里被发现后，就有机会被介绍到专业学校去继续深造。
    文化宫西北角有一个可以容纳四千多观众的体育场。不久以前，这地方还是荒草满地，现在这里已建成全市最大的有夜光设备的球场。体育场里不但经常有专业篮、排球队为工人们进行杰出表演，各工厂的业余球队也不断在这里作友谊的比赛。就篮球一项来说，这里就联系着包括七千多个队员的六百三十多个工人业余球队。文化宫还有一个大型的工人业余篮、排球队联队，参加这个联队的有九十几个工厂的优秀运动员。这个联队的篮球队是首都最优秀的业余球队。在一九五二年北京市体育运动竞赛中，文化宫工人业余篮球队曾获得了篮球冠军的称号。可是，这个冠军球队的队员们，有好多人在一两年前还是不知道如何打球的“外行”哩！
    最使首都劳动人民难以忘怀的是文化宫在每年国庆节、国际劳动节等盛大节日里举行的游园大会。在那些日子里，市郊各工业区的工人以及居住在首都各地的劳动人民照例是穿着节日的盛装从四面八方涌来。在劳动剧场里，在体育场里，在游艺厅里，在后园的河面上，都有精彩的演出或是愉快的游戏。一到夜晚，翠绿的松柏里出现了用彩色灯光组成的美丽灯笼，人们被照耀得那么美丽和年青。解放后的首都劳动人民生活日益愉快了！随着生产的发展和提高，他们会更加愉快和幸福的！
