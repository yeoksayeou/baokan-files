The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued instructions on strengthening specific leadership in summer production to ensure increased production of autumn crops. The full text of the instructions is as follows: This year, autumn crops were generally sown in a timely manner, and the seedlings are growing well. However, some areas in Guangdong, Fujian, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces have been hit by mountain floods. Several areas in Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces have experienced flooding, with a total of more than eight million mu of crops submerged. Some areas have experienced continuous rain, resulting in rampant weeds in the fields and the phenomenon of grass and seedlings growing together. Armyworms have seriously occurred in Shandong, Anhui, Northeast, and North China. Cotton seedlings in the Jinghui Canal cotton area of Shaanxi have suffered from insect pests during the budding and boll stage. Summer locusts have not been completely eliminated in some areas, and autumn locusts may still occur. We have now entered the most intensive stage of summer production, and July and August are the most critical seasons when various natural disasters may frequently occur, affecting the success or failure of crops. To ensure increased production of autumn crops, especially food crops, it is necessary to vigorously lead the masses to overcome various natural disasters, do a good job in intertillage, weeding, pest control, timely topdressing, irrigation, and drainage, and effectively help farmers solve various specific difficulties related to labor, livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, pesticides, and other aspects in current production. It is also necessary to effectively lead farmers to fully protect autumn seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest in autumn fields. Preparations should also be made as early as possible for the sowing of winter wheat this autumn and winter; seeds, fertilizers, and other means of production necessary for autumn plowing and sowing should be planned early. All regions have done a lot of work in the above aspects, but some regions have not paid enough attention to it, and there is a phenomenon of "tight in spring and loose in summer;" the leadership of agricultural production work in some regions is still at the level of general appeals, and they are not concerned enough about the specific difficulties of farmers in summer production, or they cannot solve them in a timely manner; the phenomenon of "five excesses" in some rural areas has not been truly overcome, delaying farmers' production. It is hoped that all regions will pay attention to checking the above problems, seize the farming season, strengthen specific leadership in summer production, assist lower levels in solving various difficult problems of farmers in production, and report relevant situations to the ministry at any time.

    中央人民政府农业部指示各地
    加强夏季生产具体领导保证大秋作物增产
    中央人民政府农业部发出关于加强夏季生产的具体领导保证大秋作物增产的指示。指示全文如下：今年大秋作物一般播种及时，禾苗生长良好。但广东、福建、安徽、湖南、江西等省的部分地区因山洪暴发，黑龙江、松江等省的若干地区一度发生水灾，共有八百余万亩田禾被淹。有的地区因阴雨连绵，田间杂草丛生，发生草苗齐长的现象。粘虫在山东、安徽、东北、华北等地已严重发生。陕西泾惠渠棉区的棉苗在蕾铃期遭受虫害。有些地区夏蝗未被彻底消灭，秋蝗还有发生可能。目前已进入夏季生产最紧张阶段，七、八两月又是各种自然灾害可能频繁发生，影响作物丰歉最关紧要的季节。为保证大秋作物特别是粮食作物的增产，必须大力领导群众战胜各种自然灾害，做好中耕、锄草、扑灭虫害、适时追肥、灌溉排水等工作，切实帮助农民解决当前生产中有关劳力、畜力、农具、肥料、药械等各种具体困难，切实领导农民全力保护秋苗，力争秋田多收。对于今秋冬麦播种工作，亦应及早准备；种子、肥料及秋耕、秋种时必需的其他生产资料等均应早做筹划。各地在上述各方面已做了不少工作，但部分地区尚未引起足够重视，存在着春紧夏松现象；有些地区对农业生产工作的领导尚停在一般号召上，对农民在夏季生产中的具体困难关心不够，或不能及时解决；有些农村中“五多”现象尚未真正克服，耽误农民生产。希各地对以上问题注意检查，抓紧农时，加强夏季生产的具体领导，协助下级解决农民生产中各种困难问题，并随时将有关情况报部。
