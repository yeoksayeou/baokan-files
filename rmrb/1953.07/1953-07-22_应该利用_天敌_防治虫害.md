    Pests should be controlled by utilizing "natural enemies"
    A letter from Xu Jiren, Central Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Protection Department: In nature, many beneficial pathogenic organisms, parasitic insects, carnivorous insects, and insectivorous amphibians, birds, and mammals grow, inhibiting the reproduction of pests. These organisms are called "natural enemies."
    Using natural enemies to eliminate pests (a term called "biological control") is one of the effective methods for controlling pests. As early as 1879, the Russian biologist Mechnikov discovered the method of using microorganisms to prevent and control pests; this method has now been adopted in the Soviet Union. For example, egg parasitoid wasps are polyphagous insects that can parasitize the eggs of eighty-four kinds of pests; parasitic wasps develop in pest eggs, preventing the pests from hatching. The Soviet Union has used this parasitic wasp to play a major role in pest control work. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Zhejiang Province in China used the Vedalia beetle in Huangyan, Zhejiang to prevent and control the cottony cushion scale on citrus, with great success. At present, the rice-producing areas of China are also promoting the use of parasitic wasps to control rice borers. When cotton aphids are rampant, there are many carnivorous ladybugs, hoverflies, and lacewings in cotton fields, all of which are "natural enemies" of aphids. The large-scale reproduction of these "natural enemies" can greatly inhibit the harm caused by cotton aphids.
    However, China has very little experience in using "natural enemies" to control pests, and the vast majority of people do not have enough understanding of the benefits of "natural enemies," so they do not protect "natural enemies," but instead capture and kill them at will. For example, the habit of eating "field frogs" is very common in various places; many farmers also remove egg masses with parasitic wasps while removing rice borer eggs, and arbitrarily capture and kill dragonflies, etc. It is hoped that agricultural institutions in various places will pay attention to studying the problem of using "natural enemies" to control pests based on local conditions, and widely publicize the benefits of "natural enemies" to farmers, pay attention to protecting "natural enemies," so as to gradually accumulate experience in this area.

### 应该利用“天敌”防治虫害

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该利用“天敌”防治虫害
    中央农业部植物保护司徐纪人来信：在自然界，有许多有益的病原生物，寄生性昆虫、肉食性昆虫及食虫两栖类、鸟类及哺乳类等动物生长，抑制着害虫的繁殖。这些生物叫做“天敌”。
    利用天敌以驱除害虫（术语叫做“生物防治”），是防治害虫的有效方法之一。早在一八七九年，俄国生物学家梅切尼可夫就发现以微生物防除害虫的方法；目前这一方法在苏联已被采用。如卵寄生蜂是多食性的昆虫，能寄生八十四种害虫卵；寄生蜂在害虫卵中发育，使害虫不能卵化。苏联利用这种寄生蜂，在防治虫害工作中起了很大作用。抗战前，我国浙江地区曾利用大红瓢虫在浙江黄严防除柑桔上的吹绵介壳虫，收效很大。目前我国水稻产区防治螟虫，也正在提倡利用寄生蜂。在闹棉蚜的时候，棉田里有许多肉食性的瓢虫、食蚜虻、草蜻蛉，它们都是蚜虫的“天敌”。这些“天敌”的大量繁殖，能对棉蚜的为害起很大的抑制作用。
    但是，我国在利用“天敌”防治虫害方面的经验还很少，广大人民对“天敌”的益处还没有足够的认识，因而对“天敌”不加保护，反而任意捕杀。如各地食用“田鸡”的习惯很普遍；不少农民在采除螟卵的同时也采除了有寄生蜂的卵块，随意捕杀蜻蛉等情况也不少。希望各地农业机构根据当地具体情况，注意研究利用“天敌”防治害虫的问题，并向农民广泛宣传“天敌”的益处，对“天敌”注意保护，以逐步积累这方面的经验。
