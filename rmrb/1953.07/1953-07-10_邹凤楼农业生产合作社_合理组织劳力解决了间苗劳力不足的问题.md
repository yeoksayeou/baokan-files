    Zou Fenglou Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Rationally Organizing Labor to Solve the Problem of Insufficient Labor for Thinning

    The Zou Fenglou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangdingzi Village, Fifteenth District, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, was established this spring. Of the cooperative's 40.83 hectares of dry farmland, 34.8 hectares of major crops (such as corn, soybeans, millet, and sorghum) were planted using the new cultivation methods based on the Zhaoyuan County high-yield experience. When summer hoeing began, the cooperative faced a labor shortage, with each male laborer having to handle the thinning and weeding of an average of 2 hectares of land. Many cooperative members lacked confidence in completing the thinning work required by the new cultivation methods. Some members said, "This year, the seedlings are planted wide apart, and with frequent rain, weeds and seedlings are growing together. We don't have enough labor. If we can't get the thinning done, all our work will be wasted!" Some members even suggested, "Since we don't have enough labor and can't handle it, we shouldn't force it. Just hoe along both sides of the rows and pull out the middle." In this situation, how to properly utilize and improve the labor organization to adapt to the actual needs of summer production and complete the summer hoeing plan on time became a pressing issue for the cooperative to solve. To address this problem, the cooperative's leading cadres thoroughly implemented democratic management methods, fully utilized the wisdom of male and female cooperative members, and after everyone brainstormed, came up with ideas, and discussed repeatedly, they finally found a solution, overcame the labor shortage, and ensured that the summer hoeing plan could be completed on time.

    First, they conscientiously implemented the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, rationally calculated labor remuneration, and massively absorbed women and semi-able-bodied laborers into production. In thinning, regardless of whether they were male or female cooperative members, they uniformly implemented the method of contracting land by area and calculating work points by row. Before thinning, the land plots to be thinned were assigned standards of work based on the order of sowing and the cleanliness of the land, and contracted to cooperative members. Each person calculated work points according to the rows they worked. Whoever thinned out a certain amount earned a certain number of workdays. To take care of the specific difficulties of the women, in addition to helping organize childcare groups, the cooperative also tried to provide convenience to women with children in thinning, such as assigning them nearby land and allowing them to go home early in the evening to breastfeed their children. The method of calculating work points was: work tickets were issued once a day, accounts were reconciled every five days, and announced at that time, so that everyone knew how much work they had done and how many points they had earned, so that the women participating in thinning also had a clear idea. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of women to participate in production. During the spring plowing, only eight women participated in labor in the entire cooperative, while during the summer hoeing thinning period, this increased to fifteen.

    Second, concentrate forces to overcome difficulties. Currently, the thinning task in production is the most important and also the most labor-intensive. Therefore, all male and female laborers in the cooperative, except those responsible for manuring the land, leading the teams, and grazing cattle, were all concentrated to carry out crash thinning. Of the cooperative's twenty-one male laborers, except for ten male laborers who were drawn out to operate five sets of shovel plows for shovel weeding, the remaining eleven male laborers were completely used for thinning. After the thinning was completed, comprehensive number shovel plows were immediately used for weeding, so that weeding followed thinning, and thinning and weeding were combined, without delaying the growth of the seedlings.

    Third, rationally divide labor according to the physical strength and technical specialties of the cooperative members. For example: the more technically skilled cooperative members Zhang Jingshan, Li Jun, and others were assigned as "plowmen" using new farm tools, responsible for weeding crops sown with new farm tools, and were equipped with cooperative members Li Ronghui, Zhang Youqing, and others who were patient in using livestock, diligent in feeding the horses at the edge of the field, and also understood the technology, to be responsible for leading the teams. The four old plows also similarly determined "plowmen" and fixed the team leaders. The two people on each plow, whether new or old farm tools, also had a specific division of labor. The "plowman" was responsible for wiping the mud off the plow at any time, oiling it on time, and being responsible for temporary safekeeping. If it was damaged, they reported it to the Production Management Committee in a timely manner to find a way to repair it, so as not to delay production. The team leader was responsible for repairing the rope sets and temporary safekeeping of the rope sets. Cooperative member Hou Dianlin had bad legs and feet, and was not good at shoveling or thinning, but he was very skilled in sorting fertilizer, so the cooperative assigned him to collect manure and prepare fertilizer for topdressing during the summer hoeing period. After this appropriate allocation, the quantity and quality of manure collected by Hou Dianlin met the standards, and he could earn a workday every day. Cooperative member Hou Dianyou was disabled and could not thin seedlings, shovel land, or sort manure, so the cooperative consulted with him and contracted him to three mu of small plots (more than ten plots) of flax land, with no time limit, and he was given seven workdays for shoveling it once. With this division of labor, everyone was satisfied, worked very enthusiastically, and labor efficiency was improved accordingly.

    Fourth, strengthen the planning of production, and overcome the phenomena of idle work and absenteeism. 1. There is a temporary small-scale plan every three days, calculating the work that should be done in three days and the number of workers required, arranging the order, and telling the cooperative members, so that the cooperative members have a clear idea in their minds, have goals for their work, and avoid the problem of idle work caused by temporary division of labor every day. 2. Make full use of the gaps in thinning to carry out shovel weeding, and appropriately stagger male and female laborers. Arrange the thinning sequence according to the early and late sowing and growth of various crops. In this way, no time or labor is wasted, and thinning and shovel weeding work are carried out very timely.

    Before implementing the above methods, the more than 34 hectares of land in the Zou Fenglou cooperative that were sown using the new cultivation methods were short a total of 418 workdays. After implementing the above methods, a total of 505 workdays were saved, which not only solved the labor shortage, but also enabled the summer hoeing plan to be completed ahead of schedule.

    邹凤楼农业生产合作社
    合理组织劳力解决了间苗劳力不足的问题
    吉林省蛟河县第十五区双顶子村邹凤楼农业生产合作社是今年春天建立的。全社的四十垧八亩三分旱田中，有三十四垧八亩地的主要作物（如玉米、大豆、谷子、高粱）采用了肇源县丰产经验的新耕作法播种。夏锄开始，社内发生了缺乏劳动力的困难，全社每个男劳力平均要负担二垧地的间苗锄苗任务。许多社员对完成新耕作法中的间苗工作信心不足。有的社员说：“今年苗幅播得宽，雨水又勤，草苗一齐长，劳力又不够用，若是苗间不过来不是白费工了！”有的社员竟主张“既然劳力不够用，干不过来趁早别勉强，只好用锄头在播幅两傍一锄，中间拔拔就算了”。在这种情况下，如何适当地运用和改善劳动组织，以适应夏季生产的实际需要，按时完成夏锄计划，就成了该社亟待解决的问题。为了解决这个问题，社的领导干部深入贯彻了民主化的经营管理方法，充分发挥了男女社员的智慧，经过大家动脑筋、想办法和反复讨论，终于想出了办法，克服了人力不足的困难，保证能按时完成夏锄计划。
    首先，他们切实贯彻了男女同工同酬的原则，合理地计算劳动报酬，大量地吸收妇女和半劳力参加生产。在间苗中，不论男女社员一律实行按地包工、按垅计工的办法。在间苗之前，把所需间苗的地块，根据播种先后和地板荒净等具体情况，规定出标准工，包给社员，每人干活时按垅计算工分。谁间出多少，就挣多少劳动日。为了照顾妇女们的切身困难，该社除了帮助组织看孩子小组以外，还尽量给有小孩的妇女以间苗上的方便，如把近地分给她们，晚上让她们提前回家奶小孩等等。计工的方法是：一天一发工票，五天一对账，并当时公布出来，让大家知道自己干了多少活，得了多少分，使参加间苗的妇女也心中有数。这样，就大大地鼓舞了妇女参加生产的积极性，春耕中，全社只有八名妇女参加劳动，夏锄间苗期中则增加到了十五名。
    其次是集中力量，突破难关。当前生产中间苗任务是最重要也是最费工的，因此，把全社所有的男女劳力，除去负责?地、牵套和放牛的以外，全部集中起来，突击间苗。全社二十一名男劳力，除抽出十名男劳力套出五付铲?机进行铲?以外，其余十一名男劳力完全用来间苗。间完苗随即用综合号铲?机?上，做到随铲随?，铲?结合，不误小苗的成长。
    第三，根据社员的体力强弱和技术特长合理地进行分工。比如：把较有技术的社员张景山、李均等五个人分配为使用新农具的“犁把”，负责?新农具播种的庄稼，并给他们配备上使用牲口有耐性、地头喂马勤快也懂技术的社员李荣惠、张有清等五人负责牵套。四付旧犁杖也同样确定了“犁把”，固定了牵套的。新旧农具每付犁杖上的二个人也有具体的分工。“犁把”负责随时擦干净犁杖上的泥土，按时擦油和负责临时性的保管，坏了及时报告生产管理委员会设法修理，以免耽误生产。牵套的负责修理绳套和临时保管绳套。社员侯殿林腿脚不好，铲地、间苗都不顶事，但对整理肥料很有技术，社里就分配他攒粪、整粪，准备夏锄期间用的追肥。这样适当分配以后，侯殿林攒粪的数量和质量都合标准，每天都可以赚一个劳动日。社员侯殿有是残废人，间苗、铲地、整粪都不行，社里就和他商量，包给他三亩小块（十多块）线麻地，日期不限，铲一遍就给记七个劳动日。这样分工，大伙都满意，干活都挺起劲，劳动效率因而提高了。
    第四，加强生产的计划性，克服了窝工和旷工现象。一、每三天都有一个临时性的小段计划，把三天应干的活计和需用的工数计好，顺序也排好，并告诉社员，使社员心里有底，干活有目标，避免天天临时分工而发生窝工的毛病。二、尽量利用间苗空隙进行铲?，男女劳力适当排开。按照各种作物播种的早迟和生长情况，安排间苗顺序。这样做法，不浪费一点时间和劳力，间苗铲?工作都进行得很及时。
    在没有实行以上的办法之前，邹凤楼社的三十四垧多用新耕作法播种的地，一共缺四百十八个工，在实行了上述办法以后，共省出五百零五个工，不但解决了劳力不足的困难，而且还能提前完成夏锄计划。（志强、恩贵、松林、兆财、林坤）
