Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: The deviation of impatience and rashness in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement in the North China region has been basically corrected. More than six thousand agricultural production cooperatives in the region are gradually moving towards consolidation, and mutual aid teams have also seen new development.

The correction of the deviation of impatience and rashness in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in North China began as early as the beginning of March after the Rural Work Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a meeting. After the publication of the CPC Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation in mid-March and other documents, the Party committees at all levels in North China attached great importance to them and conscientiously studied them. Various localities held meetings and organized a considerable number of cadres, led by the CPC prefectural and county committees, to conduct a comprehensive inspection and rectification of more than nine thousand agricultural production cooperatives in the region. As a result of the rectification, more than two thousand six hundred cooperatives were converted into mutual aid teams because they did not meet the conditions. Among the more than six thousand cooperatives that were retained, more than half had about one-tenth of their members, including a small number of households without agricultural labor or non-agricultural laborers, voluntarily withdrew from the cooperatives. The original one hundred and thirty-five large cooperatives with more than fifty households have been tightened or divided according to the specific circumstances. The problem of compulsory inclusion of draft animals and farm implements into the cooperatives has also been resolved by adopting methods such as renting, hiring, and valuing as shares, based on the voluntariness of the members. Therefore, the chaotic situation in the countryside quickly stopped, and the farmers' production enthusiasm also quickly stabilized. The region smoothly completed spring plowing and sowing despite the severe spring drought. Mutual aid teams in many areas have also developed and consolidated due to strengthened leadership. During this spring's drought resistance and sowing in Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province, more than 53,000 temporary mutual aid teams were developed, and the existing mutual aid teams were also strengthened and consolidated due to strengthened leadership. In Anguo County, nearly 10,000 farm households participated in mutual aid teams during spring plowing and sowing, increasing the number of farm households in the county participating in mutual aid teams from 20% to 38% of the total number of farm households.

In correcting the deviation of impatience and rashness in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, North China generally acted in a timely and stable manner, protecting the initiative of the individual economy without harming the initiative of mutual aid and cooperation. Various localities have grasped the following links in specific practices: First, closely integrate with production. From policy publicity and work arrangements to the handling of specific issues, everything revolves around production. Cooperatives that were decided to be closed down were also arranged for production first, and then the methods for transferring to teams were stipulated. Land and draft animal issues were handled first, and then accounts were settled to ensure that the reorganization of the cooperatives did not delay production. Second, correctly publicize and implement policies. Review each cooperative to ensure voluntary participation and freedom to withdraw. Adopt a positive attitude to help cooperatives that can be run well but have difficulties to consolidate them. For cooperatives that should be closed down, mobilize members to discuss, weigh the pros and cons, and steadily transfer to mutual aid teams. For members who want to withdraw from the cooperative but are afraid to do so, explain the policies, eliminate concerns, and ensure that they will not be politically attacked or economically harmed after withdrawing from the cooperative. Third, for those whose draft animals and farm implements have been valued and entered into the cooperative, on the principle of protecting the interests of middle peasants without harming the interests of poor peasants, allow multiple forms of existence within a cooperative based on the specific requirements of the members and the economic conditions of each cooperative. Fourth, rely on the leadership of the CPC branch, thoroughly implement policies, and mobilize the masses inside and outside the cooperative to consciously correct the deviation of impatience and rashness. However, due to time constraints, some cooperatives in individual areas that should have been closed down were not, and some that should not have been closed down were closed down instead. Some cooperatives, although closed down, did not handle draft animals and farm implements in a timely manner. In some areas, there were deviations in the publicity of policies, which added some new confused concepts to the masses. Local leading organs are paying attention to solving these problems.

At present, the situation of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in North China is: in advanced areas, organized farmers account for about 70% to 80%, in areas with a poor working foundation, about 20%, and in general areas, about 40%. Judging from the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, in old areas with a history of ten years of mutual aid, after correcting the deviation of impatience and rashness, the mutual aid and cooperation movement is advancing steadily. In the old areas that have undergone a long period of guerrilla warfare, have a good working foundation, and have completely completed social reforms, and in the areas where land reform has ended not long ago or has ended long ago and the remaining problems of social reform have not been cleared up (including most of Suiyuan Province and small parts of Hebei and Shanxi Provinces), on the one hand, the deviation of impatience and rashness has been corrected, and on the other hand, the originally existing serious deviation of laissez-faire has not been criticized as it should be, which has affected the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

In response to the above situation, North China is implementing the policy of adhering to the development of mutual aid teams as the center (especially in areas with more serious laissez-faire deviations), while steadily developing agricultural production cooperatives in a controlled manner.

Strengthening the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Various localities are developing temporary mutual aid teams, cultivating typical examples of year-round mutual aid teams, and using typical demonstration methods to attract the masses to organize; mutual aid teams should pay attention to solving seven aspects: seizing moisture and season, labor arrangement, combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, technical improvement, evaluation of work and calculation of work points, equal value and mutual benefit, and internal democracy. The leadership should pay attention to changing the practice of treating mutual aid teams as administrative organizations and thus hindering production in order to consolidate the mutual aid teams. Agricultural production cooperatives should also strengthen operation and management, and pay attention to solving five aspects from simple to complex: production plans, labor use, evaluation of work and calculation of work points, financial accounting, and democratic management, in order to ensure the members' enthusiasm for production and increase the members' actual income. Party committees at all levels below the prefectural committee personally take action, grasp key points, cultivate typical examples, summarize experiences, and strengthen the specific leadership of mutual aid and cooperation; at the same time, they conscientiously organize rural work cadres to study the CPC Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and Chairman Mao's works on organizing in order to overcome the shortcomings of swaying from left to right. Various localities also plan to train the backbone members of mutual aid and cooperation in batches in a planned way during the slack season, clearly explain the guidelines and policies, exchange experiences, and seize the time to train the accountants of agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest to prepare for the distribution after the autumn harvest.

    华北地区农业生产互助合作运动基本上纠正了急躁冒进偏向
    【新华社十八日讯】华北地区农业生产互助合作运动中的急躁冒进偏向已基本上得到纠正。全区六千多个农业生产合作社正逐步走向巩固，互助组也有新的发展。
    华北各地对互助合作运动中急躁冒进偏向的纠正，早自三月初中共中央华北局农村工作部召开会议以后即已开始。三月中旬中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等文件发布后，华北各级党委都很重视，并认真地进行了学习。各地分别召开会议，组织相当数量的干部，由中共地委、县委领导，对全区九千多个农业生产合作社普遍进行了检查整顿。整顿结果，有二千六百多个社因条件不够转为互助组。在保留下的六千多个社中，有半数以上社内约十分之一的社员，包括少数无农业劳动力户或非农业劳动者，自愿地退出了社。原有一百三十五个五十户以上的大社，根据具体情况，已紧缩或分办。耕畜、农具强迫归社的问题，也已根据社员自愿，分别采取租用、雇用和作价入社等办法加以解决。因此，农村混乱现象迅速停止，农民生产情绪也迅速趋于稳定。全区在春旱严重的情况下，顺利地完成了春耕播种。不少地区的互助组也有所发展和巩固。河北省张家口专区在今春抗旱播种中发展了五万三千多个临时互助组，旧有互助组也因加强领导而更加巩固。安国县春耕播种中有近万农户参加了互助组，使全县互助组的农户数占总农户数由百分之二十增加到百分之三十八。
    华北各地在纠正互助合作运动中的急躁冒进偏向中，一般都很及时、稳当，做到既保护了个体经济的积极性，又没有伤害互助合作的积极性。各地在具体作法上掌握了如下几个环节：一、紧密结合生产。从政策宣传、工作安排到具体问题的处理，都围绕生产进行。决定停办的社也都先安排生产而后规定转组的办法，先处理土地、耕畜问题，再结算账目，使整社不误生产。二、正确宣传和贯彻政策。逐社审查，做到入社自愿、出社自由。对可能办好而有困难的社，采取积极帮助的态度，使其巩固下来；对应该停办的社，发动社员讨论，权衡利害，稳步转为互助组；对想退社而不敢退的社员，也讲清政策，消除顾虑，并保证退社后在政治上不受打击，经济上不受损失。三、耕畜、农具已作价入社者，在既保护中农利益又不伤害贫农利益的原则下，从社员具体要求和各社经济条件出发，在一社内允许多种形式存在。四、依靠中共支部的领导，深入贯彻政策，发动社内外群众自觉纠正急躁冒进偏向。但是，由于时间紧迫，个别地区有些社该停办的未停办，不该停办的反而停办了；有些社虽已停办，但耕畜、农具未及时处理。有的地区宣传政策上有偏差，又给群众增加了些新的糊涂观念。这些问题，当地领导机关正注意解决中。
    现在，华北各地互助合作组织的情况是：先进地区组织起来的农户约占百分之七八十，工作基础较差地区约占百分之二十左右，一般地区在百分之四十左右。就互助合作的基础看，在有十年互助历史的老区，经过纠正急躁冒进偏向后，互助合作运动正在稳步前进。在经过长期游击战争、工作基础较好、社会改革已彻底完成的老区，和土地改革结束不久或早已结束而社会改革遗留问题尚未清理的地区（包括绥远省大部和河北、山西两省小部），一方面急躁冒进偏向已经纠正，另一方面原来存在着严重的放任自流偏向没有得到应有的批判，影响到互助合作运动的发展。
    针对以上情况，华北各地正在贯彻坚持以发展互助组为中心（特别在放任自流偏向较严重的地区），同时有控制地稳步地发展农业生产合作社的方针。
    加强对互助合作运动的领导。各地从发展临时互助组，培养常年互助组的典型，以典型示范方法，吸引群众组织起来；互助组内注意解决抢墒抢季、劳力安排、农副业结合、技术改进、评工计工、等价互利和内部民主等七个方面的问题，领导方面注意改变把互助组当成行政组织因而妨碍生产的作法，以巩固互助组。农业生产合作社也加强经营管理，注意由简到繁地解决生产计划、劳力使用、评工计工、财务会计和民主管理等五方面的问题，以保证发挥社员的生产积极性，增加社员实际收入。地委以下各级党委都亲自动手、掌握重点、培养典型、总结经验，加强对互助合作的具体领导；同时认真组织农村工作干部学习中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等文件和毛主席关于组织起来的著作，以克服左右摇摆的缺点。各地并拟在挂锄期间有计划地分批集训互助合作的骨干分子，明确交代方针政策，交流经验，并在秋收前抓紧训练农业生产合作社的会计，作好秋收后分配的准备。
