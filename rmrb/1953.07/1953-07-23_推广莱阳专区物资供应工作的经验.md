    Popularize the Experience of Material Supply Work in Laiyang Prefecture
    In our rural work, due to the recent development of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, the phenomenon of forcibly promoting new agricultural tools and cultivation techniques, which ignored the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, has been criticized. This has improved the ideological level and work style of the majority of rural cadres. Many correct work styles and methods that are suitable for actual needs and welcomed by farmers are constantly emerging. The material supply work in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province this spring is a good example. The cadres of the Laiyang Prefecture Supply and Marketing Cooperative and other departments, under the leadership of Party and government organizations at all levels, started from the local specific conditions and the actual needs of the farmers, adopted various lively methods, and carried out material supply work centered on spring plowing and production, which was welcomed by the farmers and achieved good results. The experience of Laiyang Prefecture and similar experiences in other regions should be vigorously promoted.
    The experience of material supply work in Laiyang Prefecture proves that in the current rural work, it is necessary to oppose ignoring the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, oppose excessive interference in farmers' production and life, resolutely abolish various subjectivist and commandist work methods, and, based on actual needs and possible conditions, actively carry out necessary economic and political work for farmers, in order to promote the development of agricultural production and guide farmers to move forward continuously. In the past, the tendency of forced allocation occurred in the material supply work in various places mainly because they did not base their work on the local actual conditions, forced the masses to accept things that were fundamentally not suitable for the needs of the masses, or things that were beneficial to the masses but that the masses could not accept for the time being, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. This bad work style must be resolutely opposed. However, in the struggle against this tendency, in some areas and departments, there has been a tendency to negate everything and not dare to lead the peasants. Some people believe that the various tasks carried out in the countryside in the past are unnecessary. Some people regard the correct leadership of the peasants as undue interference. Therefore, they took back the new agricultural tools that had been distributed to the farmers in the past and could be used only after technical instruction and repair of parts, on the pretext of opposing coercion and command. They believed that the peasants would never use chemical fertilizers. Seeing that the peasants did not have enough fertilizer and that the fertilizer was being overstocked in the warehouse, they did not dare to actively promote the existing chemical fertilizers. This laissez-faire tendency is also very wrong.
    In fact, most of the many tasks we have carried out in the countryside in the past are suitable for the needs of farmers and the country, and we should do them better in the future. Some are suitable for actual needs, but have had the opposite effect due to improper practices, which can be done well as long as the wrong practices are resolutely corrected. Only a small part is fundamentally unsuitable for the current situation and should be resolutely stopped. We must never "refuse to eat for fear of choking," and stop all good things in order to oppose a few bad things. Things like promoting new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers are obviously beneficial to the masses and can be accepted by the masses. Because the basic situation now is not that there are too many agricultural tools and fertilizers, but that the agricultural tools and fertilizers in most areas have not yet recovered to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan; even if some areas have recovered to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, they must continue to increase in order to meet the needs of agricultural development. The cadres in Laiyang Prefecture grasped this spirit, and in the material supply work this spring, they bravely conducted self-criticism to the masses and corrected the mistakes and shortcomings in their past work. After overcoming the tendency of forced allocation, they actively and proactively supplied materials, which immediately showed good results. This shows that everything that is beneficial to the masses and can be accepted by the masses must be actively done. If the method is not right, the method must be changed, but it must never be stopped.
    The experience of material supply work in Laiyang Prefecture proves that educating the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives to clearly recognize the policy of serving agricultural production, and reversing the relatively common purely task-oriented and one-sided profit-oriented views among these cadres, is a prerequisite for doing a good job in material supply. The basic task of the supply and marketing cooperatives is to serve agricultural production, and on this basis, to organize millions of small-scale peasant producers economically and bring them into the orbit of the national planned economy. The supply and marketing cooperatives should promote the products of farmers and supply the means of production and means of livelihood needed by farmers, all of which should be carried out around this central task. In the past, some cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives made the mistake of allocating means of production to the farmers because they did not understand or were unwilling to accept this policy. They regarded the supply and marketing cooperatives as purely commercial organs, reduced themselves to ordinary "traders," and adopted various methods that violated the interests of the masses to pursue the numbers of sales tasks assigned by their superiors, which resulted in many good things being done poorly. The supply and marketing cooperatives should adopt the methods of mass work to carry out their work, that is, based on the needs and willingness of the masses, carry out patient persuasion and demonstration education, and gradually influence and guide the masses to move forward. Many cadres in Laiyang Prefecture did just that. They combined the task of imparting technology with the task of selling goods, went deep into the countryside as production organizers, understood the thoughts of the masses, discovered the demands of the masses, helped the masses produce, and taught the masses the technology of using new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers. When the masses saw that these agricultural tools and fertilizers had good results, they all rushed to buy and order them. In this way, agricultural production was done well, and the sales tasks of the supply and marketing cooperatives were also completed smoothly. The "hanging plow" of forced allocation in the past became a "good plow," and those who had been seen by the masses as "people who allocated chemical fertilizers and forced the sale of step plows" became cadres welcomed by the masses. However, the experience of Laiyang Prefecture also proves that the material supply work must never be handed over to the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives alone, but should be led by the Party committees at all levels, and the cadres of the Party, the government, the cooperatives, and the banks should be organized to carry out propaganda and education, technical instruction, issuing agricultural loans, allocating materials, and purchasing local products separately; only by doing these tasks well can we vigorously promote agricultural production and open up a broad path for material supply work.
    Using actual examples to conduct in-depth propaganda and strengthen technical guidance is the correct method for Laiyang Prefecture to do a good job in material supply. In the past, the promotion of certain new agricultural tools was not welcomed by farmers, not only because they were indeed not suitable for use in some areas, but mainly because the farmers did not know how to use them, and the cadres who carried out the promotion work did not know how to use them either. In view of this reason, when we carry out material supply work, we must make the cadres who carry out the promotion work understand how to use them, go to the countryside to make examples for the farmers, and make them truly feel that these things "work" and are "really good," so that they can be happy to purchase them and change the traditional habits of the farmers. In order to conduct example propaganda, the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives and the cadres at the county, district, and village levels must conscientiously study agricultural technology, go to the countryside with technology, and act as teachers for the farmers, so as to lead the masses to produce more effectively. Now, many rural work cadres do not understand technology, and are afraid that the farmers will raise questions in this regard, and even take a "respectful but distant" attitude towards many well-run mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, refusing to approach them. This technological backwardness has resulted in political detachment from the masses, which is very dangerous. Laiyang Prefecture adopted the method of centralized training and field experiments, mobilized leading cadres of various counties to take the lead in learning technology, went deep into the fields to educate farmers, and truly realized the slogan of "guarantee teaching, guarantee use, and guarantee repair" and "teach first, then sell, and don't sell if you don't know how." Because the cadres have learned their skills, they have high confidence and are willing to approach the masses. Because the cadres have truly solved their problems, the masses also warmly welcome these cadres. Such material supply work not only directly promoted production, but also changed the work style of the cadres and strengthened the ties between the Party, the government, and the broad masses of farmers. This should be vigorously promoted.

    推广莱阳专区物资供应工作的经验
    我们在农村工作方面，由于近来反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争的开展，批判了那种忽视小农经济特点的强迫推广新式农具和耕作技术的现象，使广大农村干部的思想水平和工作作风提高了一步。许多适合实际需要的为农民所欢迎的正确的工作作风和工作方法正在不断出现。山东莱阳专区今年春季的物资供应工作，就是一个很好的例子。莱阳专区供销合作社的干部和其他部门的干部，在各级党政机关的领导下，从当地的具体情况和农民的实际需要出发，采用各种生动活泼的方式，围绕着春耕生产进行物资供应工作，受到农民的欢迎，取得良好的成绩。莱阳专区的经验以及其他地区类似的经验，应该努力加以推广。
    莱阳专区物资供应工作的经验证明，在当前的农村工作中，必须在反对忽视小农经济的特点，反对过多地干涉农民的生产和生活，坚决废止各种主观主义和命令主义的工作方法的基础上，按照实际需要和可能条件，积极地对农民进行必要的经济工作和政治工作，以便推动农业生产的发展，引导农民不断前进。过去各地所以在物资供应工作中发生了强迫摊派的偏向，主要是因为没有根据当地的实际情况，把根本不适合群众需要的东西，或者把虽然对群众有利但群众一时还不能接受的东西，强制群众接受，以致引起群众不满。这种恶劣的作风必须受到坚决的反对。但在反对这种偏向的斗争中，在某些地区和某些部门，又发生了否定一切、不敢领导农民的偏向。有些人认为过去在农村中进行的各种工作都是不必要的。有些人把对农民的正确领导也看成是不应有的干涉。因此，他们把过去发放到农民手中的、仅仅经过技术传授和修配零件的工作就能使用的新式农具，也藉口反对强迫命令而原封收回。他们认为农民永远不会使用化学肥料，眼看着农民手中肥料不足而仓库中肥料被积压着，也不敢积极推销已有的化学肥料。这种放任自流的偏向，同样是十分错误的。
    事实上，我们过去在农村中进行的许多工作，其中大部分是适合农民和国家的需要的，今后应该把它作得更好。有些是虽然适合实际的需要，但因作法不当而发生了相反的效果，这只要坚决改正了错误的作法就能作好。仅仅有一部分是根本不适合当前情况的，应该坚决地把它停办。我们决不能“因噎废食”，为了反对少数坏事而停办一切好事。像推销新式农具、化学肥料这样的事情，显然是对群众有利的，完全能够被群众所接受的。因为现在的基本情况并不是农具、肥料过多，而是绝大部分地区的农具、肥料还没有恢复到抗日战争以前的水平；即使有些地区已经恢复到抗日战争以前的水平，也要继续增加，才能适应农业发展的需要。莱阳专区的干部掌握了这种精神，在今年春季的物资供应工作中，勇敢地向群众进行自我批评，改正过去工作中的错误和缺点。他们在克服了强迫摊派的偏向以后，积极主动地供应物资，立即显示了良好的成绩。这就说明，一切对群众有利、能为群众接受的事情，都必须积极去作，作法不对要改变作法，但绝不能停止不作。
    莱阳专区物资供应工作的经验证明，教育供销合作社的干部明确认识为农业生产服务的方针，扭转这些干部中比较普遍存在着的单纯任务观点和片面营利观点，是作好物资供应工作的先决条件。供销合作社的基本任务是为农业生产服务，并在这个基础上，把千百万农民小生产者从经济上组织起来，并把他们纳入国家计划经济的轨道上去。供销合作社推销农民的产品，供应农民所需要的生产资料和生活资料，都应该围绕这个中心任务来进行。过去某些供销合作社的干部所以发生了向农民摊派生产资料的错误，就是因为他们还不了解或者不愿接受这个方针。他们把供销合作社看作单纯的商业机关，把自己降低成一般的“买卖人”，采取各种违反群众利益的方法，追求上级分配的推销任务的数目字，结果就把许多好事办坏了。供销合作社应该采取群众工作的方法来进行工作，即根据群众的需要和自愿，进行耐心的说服和示范教育，逐步影响和引导群众前进。莱阳专区的许多干部就是这样作的。他们把传授技术和推销货物的任务结合起来，以生产组织者的姿态深入农村，了解群众的思想，发现群众的要求，帮助群众生产，向群众传授使用新式农具和化学肥料的技术。群众看到这些农具、肥料的效果良好，就都争先购买订置。这样，农业生产搞好了，供销合作社的推销任务也顺利完成了。过去强迫摊派的“挂犁”变成“好犁”，曾经被群众看成“摊派化学肥料强卖步犁的人”变成了为群众所欢迎的干部。但莱阳专区的经验同时证明，绝不能把物资供应工作单纯交给供销合作社的干部去做，而应由各级党委统一领导，把党的、政府的、合作社的、银行的干部组织起来，分头进行宣传教育、技术传授、发放农贷、调配物资、收购土产等工作；只有作好这些工作，才能有力地推动农业生产，并给物资供应工作开辟了广阔的道路。
    用实际的事例进行深入的宣传，加强技术指导，这是莱阳专区做好物资供应工作的正确方法。过去各地推广某些新式农具等所以不受农民欢迎，除了因为它们对某些地区确实不适合于使用以外，主要的还是因为农民不懂得怎样使用，而进行推广工作的干部也不懂得使用。针对这种原因，我们在进行物资供应工作的时候，就必须使进行推广工作的干部自己懂得使用，下乡给农民作出样子，使他们真正感觉到这些东西“管用”、“真好”，他们才能乐于购置，才能改变农民传统的习惯。为了进行实例宣传，供销合作社的干部和县、区、村各级干部，都必须认真学习农业技术，带技术下乡，充当农民的教员，更有效地领导群众生产。现在许多农村工作干部不懂技术，害怕农民向自己提出这方面的问题，竟对许多工作较好的互助组、农业生产合作社采取“敬而远之”的态度，拒不接近他们。这种技术上的落后就产生了政治上脱离群众的结果，这是非常危险的。莱阳专区采用集中训练和实地试验的办法，发动各县领导干部带头学习技术，深入田间教育农民，真正实现了“保教、保用、保修理”、“先教后卖、不会不卖”的口号。干部因为学会了本领，信心很高，愿意接近群众。群众因为干部真正给自己解决了问题，也热烈欢迎这些干部。这样的物资供应工作不仅直接推进了生产，而且转变了干部的作风，密切了党、政府和广大农民群众的联系。这是应该大力加以提倡的。
