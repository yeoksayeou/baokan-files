(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 30th) According to TASS, the people of West Germany, together with the people of Democratic Germany, strongly condemn the fascist provocations perpetrated in Berlin and the German Democratic Republic by special agents hired by West German and foreign monopoly capitalists.

    The Communist Party members of the North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament, in their statement, said that the events in Berlin and the German Democratic Republic clearly show that the provocations against the German people and the people of the world were prepared for a long time. The purpose of the agitators and organizers of this riot was to prevent the easing of tensions in Germany and the world.

    The Communist Party members emphasized the importance of the German Democratic Republic government's plan to improve the living conditions of the people of the Republic and eliminate obstacles to reaching an agreement among all German people and unifying Germany. They pointed out that the measures of the German Democratic Republic government are not only supported by the people of the Republic, but also by all peace-loving Germans.

    People with very different worldviews and political beliefs resent the fascist adventures in Berlin and the German Democratic Republic.

    Pastor Obsehoff of Bremen said: "As the German Democratic Republic government makes greater efforts to seek an agreement among all German people, Adenauer's last hope is dashed. … It is at this time that the riots occurred, and the agitators of this riot should undoubtedly be sought in West Germany."

    Dr. Julius Hahn of Frankfurt am Main said:
    "The methods used in Potsdamer Platz are the same as those used in the previous attacks on the Communist Party headquarters in Duisburg or the Reichstag fire in Berlin in 1933, etc. These events convince me that all German people who recognize their responsibility should hold a meeting together in order to reach an agreement among all German people despite all obstacles."

    Lutz, the trade union leader of Duisburg-Hamborn, said about the riots organized by fascists in Berlin: "This is an attack on the democratic rights of our entire nation."

    西德人民强烈斥责法西斯分子的挑衅行为
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十八日讯：西德人民和民主德国人民一道，强烈地斥责西德和外国垄断资本家雇佣的特务在柏林和德意志民主共和国制造的法西斯挑衅活动。
    北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州共产党州议员在他们的声明中说，柏林和德意志民主共和国所发生的事件极清楚地表明，对德国人民和全世界人民的挑衅是经过长久准备的，这次骚乱的煽动者和组织者的目的就是阻止德国和世界紧张局势的缓和。
    共产党议员们强调德意志民主共和国政府计划改善共和国人民生活条件，消除对全德人民达成协议和统一德国的障碍的决议的重要性。他们指出，德意志民主共和国政府的措施不但受到共和国人民的拥护，同时也受到所有爱好和平的德国人的拥护。
    抱有极不相同的世界观和政治信仰的人们都愤恨法西斯分子在柏林和德意志民主共和国内的冒险行为。
    不莱梅的牧师奥布塞霍夫说：“由于德意志民主共和国政府更加努力寻求达成全德人民的协议，阿登纳的最后希望破灭了。……正在这时候发生了骚乱，这次骚乱的煽动者无疑地应该在西德寻找。”
    美因河畔法兰克福的尤利乌斯·汉恩博士说：
    “在波茨坦广场上所采用的方法是和从前袭击杜伊斯堡共产党总部或一九三三年柏林的国会纵火案等等事件一样的。这些事件使我深信，全德人民凡认识到他们的责任的都应该一起举行会议，以便不顾一切障碍使全德人民达成协议。”
    杜伊斯堡—汉波恩工会领袖洛伊茨谈到法西斯分子在柏林组织的骚乱说：“这是对我们全国人民民主权利的一次攻击。”
