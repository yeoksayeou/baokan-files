    Tong County Branch of the Hebei Provincial Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company Strengthens Cotton Warehouse Protection Management
    Comrades Mi Yongqing and Zhao Mingshan from the Tong County Branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company write: After the cotton fire incident at the Handan Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company, our company's leading comrades convened an emergency meeting of all warehouse personnel to discuss how to learn from the Handan fire incident and strengthen our future fire prevention work. Our company's freight yard lacks water sources, and fire safety equipment is also insufficient; we have now proactively submitted a plan for replenishing these, which has been submitted to higher authorities for study and approval. Some of our warehouse security personnel and storage personnel have also examined their own complacency and guaranteed to strengthen their political vigilance and work responsibility in the future.
    We suggest that the direct administrative leading organs of warehouses in various regions should establish a regular inspection system to ensure the safety of state property.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    河北省通县花纱布支公司加强棉仓防护管理工作
    中国花纱布公司通县支公司米永清、赵明山来信：邯郸花纱布公司棉花失火事件发生后，我公司领导同志召开了一个所有仓库人员的紧急会议，讨论了怎样从邯郸失火事件中吸取教训，以加强我们今后的防火工作的问题。我公司货场缺乏水源，防火安全设备也很不足；这次已主动提出添置计划，呈请上级研究批准。我们仓库的部分保卫人员和保管人员也检查了自己的麻痹思想，保证今后加强政治警惕性和工作责任心。
    我们建议各地仓库的直接行政领导机关，应该建立定期的检查制度，以保证国家资财的安全。
