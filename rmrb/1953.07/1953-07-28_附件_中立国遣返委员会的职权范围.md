Article 1 General

(I) In order to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice, both sides invite Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and India to each appoint a commissioner to establish a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to receive in Korea those prisoners of war who, while under the custody of the detaining parties, have not exercised their right to be repatriated. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall establish its headquarters near Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone and shall dispatch subordinate bodies identical in composition to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to each location where the Repatriation Commission is responsible for guarding prisoners of war. Representatives of both sides shall be permitted to observe the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its subordinate bodies, including interpretation and visits.

(II) Sufficient armed forces and any other personnel required to assist the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in performing its duties and responsibilities shall be provided exclusively by India, with the Indian representative serving as umpire in accordance with Article 132 of the Geneva Convention, and the Indian representative shall also be the chairman and executive of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The representative of each of the other four countries shall be permitted an equal number of staff assistants, but not exceeding fifty (50) per country. In the event of the absence of a representative of any of the neutral nations for any reason, a substitute representative of the same nationality designated by that representative shall act in his place. The weapons of all personnel specified in this paragraph shall be limited to light weapons of the military police type.

(III) No force or threat of force shall be used against the prisoners of war referred to in paragraph 1 above to obstruct or compel their repatriation, and no violence shall be inflicted on the persons of prisoners of war or insult their dignity or self-esteem in any way or for any purpose (but with reference to paragraph 7 below). This task shall be entrusted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Commission shall also ensure that prisoners of war are at all times treated humanely in accordance with the specific provisions of the Geneva Convention and the general spirit of that Convention.

Article 2 Custody of Prisoners of War

(IV) All prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated after the effective date of the Armistice Agreement shall be released from the military control and custody of the detaining party as soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty days after the effective date of the Armistice Agreement, and handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at a place designated by the detaining party within Korea.

(V) When the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission assumes jurisdiction over the place of residence of prisoners of war, the armed forces of the detaining party shall withdraw from that place so that the place mentioned in the preceding paragraph is completely taken over by the armed forces of India.
