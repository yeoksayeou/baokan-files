    Four Years of Persistent Self-Study of Theory
    Luo Zicheng, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    (I)

    After the summer of 1949, I deeply felt that studying Marxism-Leninism was the duty and responsibility of a Communist Party member, and the rapid development of the revolutionary cause made me feel an urgent need to study theory. From that time on, I began systematic theoretical study. Over the past four years, I have read the "Concise History of Social Development," "Political Economy," "The Communist Manifesto," "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific," "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" (Volumes 1 and 2), "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," "The State and Revolution," "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," "Foundations of Leninism," and "Methodology of Thought" (read 245 pages) from the twelve "Must-Read for Cadres" books prescribed by the Party Central Committee in the past; and selected and read more than fifty articles from "Stalin's Selected Works," Volumes 1 and 2 of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Lenin's "What Is to Be Done?", Kalinin's "On Communist Education," "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," and more than twenty other relevant articles. Since November of last year, I have studied Comrade Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; re-studied Leontiev's "Political Economy"; and focused on studying Comrade Stalin's question on the nature of economic laws and the agricultural and leadership sections in Comrade Malenkov's report.

    In addition, over the past few years, I have also read more than forty books on history and literature, such as "Ten Critiques," "The Storm," "War and Peace," "The End of World Capitalism," and various documents and instructions related to my work at various times.

    (II)

    Our methods of theoretical study are self-study, participation in collective discussions, listening to reports, and consulting other comrades. The steps for self-study are roughly as follows: First, browse to gain a general understanding of the original book; second, study carefully, reading each sentence and paragraph in detail, marking important places with colored pens, and writing down the current understanding on the book's head; third, take notes. Most of the theoretical books I have read have notes. My method of taking notes is to either write down the main points in outline form or write down my own experiences in connection with reality. Generally, I focus on understanding the original book and only consult reference books when necessary. Because my theoretical foundation is shallow, reading too many reference books will affect my understanding of the original book. Therefore, when reading a book or a section of a book, I first clarify what the book is about, how it narrates and raises questions, what the central meaning of each paragraph and section is, and what the overall concept is. As for individual questions, I do not dwell on them first, but study them later; after the content is clarified, I then connect it with reality. According to my experience, "connecting with reality" without understanding the content often leads to far-fetched interpretations.

    Integrating theory with practice is the basic principle of learning. The purpose of learning theory is to solve practical problems in revolutionary work. In my work, I consult the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong at any time, and seek and learn from them the methods of observing and analyzing problems, raising and solving problems. For example, when I was doing rural surveys in Zhaodong County in the winter of 1949, I found that the phenomenon of coercion and command was very serious among district and village cadres in leading the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. At that time, I read Comrade Stalin's "Dizzy With Success," "Reply to Collective Farm Comrades," Comrade Mao Zedong's "Get Organized!" and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party" in the section "On the Party's Mass Line," and profoundly understood the harm of coercion and command that exceeded the masses' awareness and infringed on the interests of the middle peasants. When I reported to the provincial party committee the situation that "melons twisted by force are not sweet," the above-mentioned works greatly enlightened me. When I was doing rural surveys in Baicheng County in the winter of 1950, with the help of leading comrades, I consulted Lenin's "On Cooperation" and Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Cooperatives," combined with the survey on mutual aid and cooperation at that time, and further clarified the nature of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, as well as the policy of transforming the individual peasant economy through the mutual aid and cooperation movement to gradually move towards agricultural collectivization, and so on. In 1951, the provincial party committee proposed the issue of conducting education on the new path of rural economic development in the countryside at the provincial labor model conference. At that time, I felt it was correct and timely, but I couldn't explain why. Later, I read "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" and studied Stalin's analysis of peasants as "the economy at the crossroads" and his brilliant instructions on the peasants' familiarity with the old road and their suspicion and distrust of the new road. Therefore, I had a further understanding of the necessity and long-term nature of the provincial party committee's emphasis on conducting education on the new path of rural economic development in the countryside at that time.

    This is my approach to combining learning and solving practical problems in revolutionary work in theoretical study. Facts have proved that this is very effective in improving work and political and ideological levels.

    On the other hand, through the study of the above-mentioned twelve books over the past few years, I have moved towards systematically studying the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, further recognized the importance of studying theory, and further clarified the relationship between theory and practice. As Comrades Lenin and Stalin pointed out: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement," "Only a party guided by advanced theory can realize the role of advanced fighters," "If theory is not linked with revolutionary practice, it will become objectless theory, while practice without the guidance of revolutionary theory will become blind practice." In this way, I ideologically solved the shortcomings of being satisfied with work enthusiasm while relaxing and neglecting the study of theory in the past, and overcame the tendency of empiricism. In terms of learning attitude and learning methods, I also overcame the past problems of being ambitious, having unclear goals, and not connecting with reality.

    Regarding my study of the Party's policies, I have basically approached it from two aspects over the past few years. Because I have always been engaged in rural work, I have paid more attention to the Party's policies on rural economy. I started by studying the issue of how to give play to the peasants' enthusiasm for production after the land reform, and later focused on studying the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau's policies and resolutions on agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, and linked them with the experience of Soviet agricultural collectivization and their study of the Party's policies related to rural areas. On the other hand, since 1949, I have participated in the provincial party committee's annual surveys on rural economy, class changes, and the implementation of the Party's policies. This has greatly benefited me in improving my policy level. I feel that in order to carry out policy study, it is necessary to closely combine it with the business needs of my own department, on the one hand, to systematically pay attention to the study of the Party's relevant policies, resolutions, and instructions at various periods, and to appropriately consult the theoretical basis for the formulation of relevant policies; on the other hand, to regularly go deep into the grassroots level to conduct investigations and research, check work, check the problems in the implementation of the Party's policies, and study solutions. In this way, it can not only improve my own policy level, but also implement the Party's policies.

    In the process of learning, I also felt that: theoretical study is inseparable from leadership work. To do a good job and make fewer or no mistakes in politics, we must strengthen learning and constantly improve our theoretical and policy level. Learning is not only a personal matter, but also the responsibility and obligation of Communists, and it is a matter of serving the people better. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Party": "Party members must study for the cause of the people, not for any other purpose," "Without a strong spirit of learning and a correct learning attitude, being arrogant and complacent, and not seeking progress, is an irresponsible attitude towards the cause of the people." Therefore, in my study, I feel that I should work harder to overcome arrogance and impetuosity and learn with an open mind.

    (III)

    Over the past few years, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has insisted on implementing the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau's repeated instructions on strengthening the theoretical education of cadres, and has paid close attention to the study of cadres. The members of the provincial party committee can also take the lead in studying and helping comrades below to carry out their studies. This is an important reason for promoting my persistence in studying. Of course, on the other hand, it also depends on my own consciousness and efforts. I have generally grasped the study in this regard.

    I study for two hours or more every day. When working in the countryside, the study time is not only not reduced, but increased. For example, when we were conducting investigations in Minzhu Village, Keshan County in the winter of 1952, we carried out the study and discussion of Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as usual, exceeding the progress in the organs. Some comrades believe that it is impossible to persist in studying when going to the countryside, which is unfounded.

    But I still have many shortcomings in my study. The main ones are that I am too greedy and eager for quick success and cannot digest what I have learned. Another problem is that the learning method is rigid. Every time I read a book, I want to take notes, but the notes are cumbersome and I cannot deeply understand the essence of the documents I have read. Sometimes when I am busy with work, I often fail to "read every day." For example, during the "Three-Anti" movement in the spring of 1952, I read very little. In addition, I do not exchange opinions with other comrades enough. I am confident that I can overcome these shortcomings.

    I am willing to make further efforts on the basis of my persistent theoretical study over the past four years. My study plan is: to finish reading the unfinished part of "Methodology of Thought" and "Lenin and Stalin on China" in June, and to review the study notes on the twelve books. In July, I will study according to the content prescribed by the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee. I plan to focus on "A Collection of Documents and Materials on Soviet Economic Construction," combined with the articles and books prescribed by the Central Committee, and complete the study tasks prescribed by the superiors in the year and a half from the second half of 1953 to 1954.

    坚持自学理论的四年间
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部副部长  骆子程
    （一）
    一九四九年夏季以后，我深切感到学习马克思列宁主义是共产党员的义务和职责，而革命事业一日千里地发展也使我感到迫切地需要学习理论。从那时起，我就开始了系统的理论学习。四年多来我读过了过去党中央所规定的十二本“干部必读”中的“社会发展简史”、“政治经济学”、“共产党宣言”、“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”、“联共（布）党史”、“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”（上下两册）、“帝国主义论”、“国家与革命”、“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”、“列宁主义基础”、“思想方法论”（读了二四五页）；并选读了“斯大林选集”中的文章五十余篇，“毛泽东选集”第一、二两卷，列宁的“做什么？”，加里宁的“论共产主义教育”，“中国共产党的三十年”及其他有关文章二十余篇。从去年十一月起又学习了斯大林同志的“苏联社会主义经济问题”和马林科夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上的报告；重新温习了列昂节夫的“政治经济学”；着重地研究了斯大林同志关于经济的法则性质问题和马林科夫同志报告中关于农业部分和领导部分。
    此外，几年来我还读了“十批判书”、“暴风雨”、“战争与和平”、“世界资本主义的末日”等四十余本关于历史和文艺方面的书籍，以及各个时期与我的工作有关的文件指示等。
    （二）
    我们理论学习的方法是自修、参加集体讨论、听报告和向别的同志请教。自修的步骤大体上是这样的：第一遍浏览，以求得对原书有个总的概念的了解；第二遍精读，按句按段细读，重要处用彩色笔划上记号，并在书头上写下当时的体会；第三遍作笔记，我所读过的理论书籍，大部分有笔记。我记笔记的方法，一种是提纲式的写要点，另一种是联系实际写自己的心得。一般情况，我是以读懂原书为主，必要时才参阅参考书。因为自己的理论底子浅，过多地阅读参考书反而影响对原书的理解。所以在读一本书或一段书时，我首先是弄清楚这本书讲些什么，是怎样叙述和提出问题的，每段每节的中心意思是什么，总的概念是什么。至于个别问题，先不去扣，放到以后去研究；待内容弄清楚后，再联系实际。根据我的体会，内容没弄通就去“联系实际”，往往会造成牵强附会。
    理论联系实际是学习的基本原则。学习理论的目的，是为了解决革命工作中的实际问题。在工作中随时向马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛泽东同志的著作请教，从中寻找和学习观察分析问题、提出和解决问题的方法。例如，一九四九年冬我在肇东县作农村调查时，发现区村干部在领导农业生产互助合作运动问题上，强迫命令的现象十分严重。当时我就翻阅了斯大林同志的“胜利冲昏头脑”、“给集体农庄工作同志们的答覆”、毛泽东同志的“组织起来”和刘少奇同志的“论党”中“关于党的群众路线问题”等著作，从中深刻地理解到强迫命令超越群众觉悟，侵犯中农利益的危害性。在我向省委反映“强拧的瓜不甜”的情况中，上面那些著作对我的启发是很大的。一九五○年冬我在白城县作农村调查时，在领导同志帮助下，请教了列宁的“论合作制”、毛泽东同志的“论合作社”，结合当时关于互助合作的调查，进一步明确地认识了农业互助合作运动的性质，以及经过互助合作运动改造个体农民经济逐步走向农业集体化的方针等等问题。一九五一年，省委在全省劳动模范会议上提出在农村中进行农村经济发展的新道路教育问题，当时深感正确适时，但说不出所以然；后来翻阅了“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”，学习了斯大林分析农民是“十字路口的经济”，和他对农民熟悉旧道路而怀疑和不信任新道路等问题所作的英明指示。因之，对省委当时强调指出在农村进行农村经济发展的新道路教育的必要性和长期性有了进一步的了解。
    这就是我在理论学习上把学习和解决革命实际工作问题相结合的做法。事实证明：这样做对提高工作、提高政治思想水平是很有效果的。
    另一方面，几年来通过上述十二本书的学习，走向系统地进行马克思列宁主义基本理论的学习，进一步认识了学习理论的重要性，更明确了理论与实践之间的关系。正如列宁、斯大林同志所指示的：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”，“只有受先进理论指导的党，才能实现先进战士的作用”，“理论若不和革命实践联系起来，就会变成无对象的理论，同时，实践若不以革命理论为指南，就会变成盲目的实践。”这样在思想上就解决了过去满足于工作热情而放松和轻视学习理论的缺点，克服了经验主义的偏向。在学习态度和学习方法上，也克服了过去那种好高骛远、目的不明和不联系实际等毛病。
    关于我对党的政策的学习，几年来基本上是从两方面着手的。因为我一直是搞农村工作的，所以对党在农村经济方面的政策，较为注意。开始是从土地改革后如何发挥农民生产积极性这一问题研究起，以后以学习中央、东北局有关农业互助合作政策、决议为主，并联系苏联农业合作化的经验和他们有关农村方面党的政策的学习。另一方面是从一九四九年以来，参加省委每年一度的有关农村经济、阶级变化、党的政策贯彻执行情况的调查。这对提高自己政策水平有很大裨益。我觉得进行政策学习，必须密切结合自己本部门的业务需要，一方面有计划地注意学习党在各个时期有关的政策、决议和指示，适当地参阅有关政策制订的理论根据；另一方面，要定期深入基层进行调查研究，检查工作，检查党的政策在贯彻执行中的问题，并研究解决的办法。这样，既能提高自己的政策水平，又能贯彻党的政策。
    在学习中我还感到：理论学习和领导工作密不可分，要想做好工作，在政治上少犯或不犯错误，只有加强学习，不断提高自己的理论政策水平。学习不仅是个人的问题，而且是共产党人的职责和义务，是为了更好地为人民服务的问题，正如刘少奇同志在“论党”中所说的：“党员必须是为人民的事业而去学习，而不是为了任何别的目的”，“没有强烈的学习精神与正确的学习态度，骄傲自满，不求进步，就是对人民事业一种不负责任的态度。”因此，我在学习中越发觉得应该力戒骄躁，虚心学习。
    （三）
    几年来，中共黑龙江省委坚持贯彻中央和东北局屡次关于加强干部理论教育的指示，对干部学习抓得很紧，省委委员并能自己带头学习和帮助下面同志进行学习，这是推动我坚持学习的重要原因。当然另一方面还靠自己的自觉和努力，我自己在这方面一般地还是抓紧了学习。
    我每天学习两小时或两小时以上，下乡工作时，读书时间不但不减少，反而增加。例如，一九五二年冬在克山县民主村作调查时，我们即照常进行了联共第十九次代表大会上马林科夫同志报告的学习和讨论，超过了在机关的进度。某些同志认为下乡就不能坚持学习，是没有根据的。
    但我在学习中还有不少缺点。主要的是有些好贪多冒进、不能消化的现象。再就是学习方法刻板，每读一本书都想记笔记，结果笔记繁琐，反而不能深刻领会所读文件的精神实质。有时工作忙的时候，就往往不能做到“每日必读”。如在一九五二年春“三反”运动时，就读书甚少。此外，和其他同志交换意见也不够。这些缺点我有信心予以克服。
    我愿在过去四年来坚持理论学习的基础之上，进一步努力钻研。我的学习计划是：六月份读完“思想方法论”未完部分和“列宁、斯大林论中国”，并温习关于十二本书的学习笔记。七月份按照中央和省委规定的内容进行学习。我计划以“苏联经济建设文件材料汇集”为主，结合中央规定学习的文章和书籍，在一九五三年下半年和一九五四年共一年半时间内，完成上级所规定的学习任务。
