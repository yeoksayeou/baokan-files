The construction projects of the construction units under the Basic Construction Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry started mostly in May this year. To ensure the quality of the projects this year, the bureau inspected the Shenyang Construction Engineering Company, Shenyang Installation Engineering Company, North China Construction Engineering Company, Central and Southern China Construction Engineering Company, East China Construction Engineering Company, and Taiyuan Engineering Office in June. During the inspection, it was found that the quality of some projects was poor, and rework and waste occurred constantly. The inferior quality of the projects is manifested in the following aspects: First, blind construction without following the drawings. For example, at the 103 construction site of the North China Construction Engineering Company, when building reinforced concrete stairs, the ironworker misread the drawings and used half the reinforcing steel less than required, and the construction worker did not carefully check. In the dormitory project of the 102 construction site of the Shenyang Construction Engineering Company, the width of the outer wall foundation should have been 60 centimeters, but it was mistakenly built to 1.1 meters, and the width of the inner wall should have been 80 or 95 centimeters, but it was all made to 90 centimeters. Second, chaotic operation. During the construction of concrete projects, workers randomly stepped on the tied steel bars; when mixing concrete, they did not pay attention to the determined mixing ratio, and there were even cases of measuring sand and stone with soil baskets; in the foundation stone masonry project, there were phenomena of large ends at the bottom, inclined surfaces facing inward, incomplete grouting, and even voids. In brick masonry projects, there was a general phenomenon of uneven horizontal lines, uneven vertical lines, inconsistent mortar joints, incomplete grouting, and even dry bricks being used on the wall. Third, the earthwork, plumbing, and electrical trades did not cooperate with each other. The places where pipe holes should have been left on the wall were not left, and holes had to be chiseled for installation afterward.

The reason for the poor quality of the projects is that many units, from top to bottom, have incorrect views on ensuring the quality of the projects. For example, an engineer from the Central and Southern China Construction Engineering Company, upon seeing the poor quality of brick masonry, said, "The brick wall is guaranteed not to fall for three months even without mortar. As long as it is plastered, it can maintain a beautiful appearance." Many people, when talking about ensuring the quality of the projects, one-sidedly emphasized objective difficulties, thinking that it was a "problem of weak technical force and low technical level of workers." Some people divided "good, fast, and economical" and believed that "strict quality requirements would not guarantee quantity." In addition, some construction sites have not established or improved the necessary institutions and systems to ensure project quality. Generally, there is a lack of clear operating procedures and quality standards, and even if there are, they have not been clearly explained to the workers, nor have they been discussed by the workers. The main materials of each project, especially concrete, are rarely tested, so they cannot meet the design requirements. Each unit lacks an independent technical quality inspection institution, and some are not sound.

In order to overcome this tendency to neglect project quality, the Basic Construction Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry instructed its subordinate construction units in early July to implement the construction operation plan in the third quarter and check the quality of the projects. The bureau also convened a meeting of inspectors from various units to understand the situation of the inspection institutions, exchange work experience, and formulate "Provisional Measures for Technical Inspection" to strengthen technical management and eliminate rework and waste.

### 第一机械工业部基本建设局检查工程质量

    第一机械工业部基本建设局检查工程质量
    中央第一机械工业部基本建设局所属施工单位本年工程在五月份内大部开工，为保证今年工程质量，该局六月份检查了沈阳建筑工程公司、沈阳安装工程公司、华北建筑工程公司、中南建筑工程公司、华东建筑工程公司和太原工程处等单位的工程。在检查中，发现部分工程质量低劣，不断发生返工浪费的现象。工程质量低劣表现在如下几方面：一，不按照图纸盲目施工。如华北建筑工程公司一○三工地，在修建铁筋混凝土楼梯时，扎铁工看错图样少用一半铁筋，施工员也没有认真检查。沈阳建筑工程公司一○二工地的宿舍工程，外墙基宽应为六十公分，竟错误地修成一公尺一，内墙宽应为八十或九十五公分，却一律做成九十公分。二，操作混乱。在混凝土工程的施工过程中，工人乱踏扎好的钢筋；在搅拌混凝土时不注意已确定的混合比例，甚至有用土篮子量砂、石的情况；基础砌石工程有大头在下、斜面朝里、灌浆不满、甚至有空洞的现象。在砌砖工程上，普遍存在横不平、竖不直、灰缝大小不一、灌浆不饱满、甚至干砖上墙的现象。三、土木、水暖、电气各工种互不配合。墙上应留管孔的地方没有留，只好事后凿洞安装。
    造成工程质量低劣的原因，是不少单位自上而下地对保证工程质量有不正确的看法。如中南建筑工程公司一位工程师看见砌砖工程质量不好，说：“砖墙不用灰浆也保证三个月不倒，只要抹上灰，保持外表美观就可以了。”有不少人谈到保证工程质量时，片面强调客观困难，以为是：“技术力量薄弱、工人技术水平低的问题。”有人将“好、快、省”分割开来看，认为：“严格要求质量，就保不住数量。”此外，有些工地还没有建立或健全必要的保证工程质量的机构和制度，一般缺乏明确的操作规程和质量标准，即使有，也没有向工人交代清楚，也没有经过工人讨论。各项工程的主要材料，特别是混凝土，很少经过试验，以致不能符合设计的要求。各单位缺乏独立的技术质量检查机构，有的也不健全。
    第一机械工业部基本建设局为克服这种忽视工程质量的倾向，于七月初指示所属施工单位在第三季度贯彻施工作业计划，检查工程质量。该局并召集各单位检查人员开会，了解检查机构的情况，交流工作经验，并拟订了“技术检查暂行办法”，以加强技术管理，消灭返工浪费现象。
