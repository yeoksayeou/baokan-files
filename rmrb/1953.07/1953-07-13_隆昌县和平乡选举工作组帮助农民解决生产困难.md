    Longchang County Heping Township Election Work Group
    Helps Farmers Solve Production Difficulties
    Reader Li Yongzhen writes: The pilot work of grassroots elections in Heping Township, Longchang County, Sichuan Province, has been combined with production since it began on May 8th. Because the election working cadres paid attention to starting from helping the masses solve the difficulties in production, the masses were relieved of their concerns that carrying out the general election would hinder production.
    At the beginning of the general election pilot work in Heping Township, it was the peak season for farmers to transplant rice seedlings. The working group cadres at that time did not know how to combine the general election with production, so they only paid attention to not affecting production time during election activities, and did not specifically study the leadership of production and help the masses solve the difficulties in production. After mid-May, farmers in Heping Township experienced a shortage of seedlings, which was caused by the masses turning "fewer seedlings and dense planting" into "more seedlings and dense planting." The general election working group studied this situation and felt that they must delve into production and specifically help the masses with production in order to ensure the smooth progress of the general election work. Therefore, they seized the issue of seedling shortage and carried out patient propaganda and education to the masses, explaining the benefits of "fewer seedlings and dense planting" and correcting the phenomenon of wasting seedlings. In this way, on the basis of the masses' willingness, the surplus seedlings were allocated and adjusted, which not only solved the difficulty of seedling shortage and expanded the area of rice planting, but also promoted the advanced production technology of fewer seedlings and dense planting. Of the sixty-four households in Luosi Village, sixteen households were short of seedlings, and all of them were able to transplant seedlings in time after adjustment. In early June, the whole township experienced a drought again. The election working group promptly helped the township cadres lead the farmers in the township to carry out drought resistance to protect seedlings, and deeply mobilized the masses to overcome paralysis and invest in drought resistance work. In a very short period of time, the whole township basically overcame the drought, making many withered seedlings turn green. With the production difficulties of the farmers solved, they then seized the gaps in production to carry out population surveys, voter registration, and other work. This approach was approved and supported by the masses of farmers, and the effect was very good. Many farmers told the cadres of the election working group that they no longer thought that engaging in the general election would affect production. The comrades of the working group also deeply felt that the election working group should also be a production working group at the same time. Only in this way can the masses be satisfied and the general election work be done well.

### 隆昌县和平乡选举工作组帮助农民解决生产困难

专栏：读者来信摘要

    隆昌县和平乡选举工作组
    帮助农民解决生产困难
    读者李永震来信：四川隆昌县和平乡的基层选举试办工作，从五月八日开始以来，一直是结合着生产进行的。由于选举工作干部注意了从帮助群众解决生产中的困难入手，使群众解除了怕搞普选妨碍生产的思想顾虑。
    和平乡的普选试办工作刚开始时，正逢农民栽秧高潮。工作组干部当时还不知道如何把普选与生产结合起来，因此只是在进行选举活动时注意不影响生产时间，而并没有具体地研究领导生产和帮助群众解决生产中的困难问题。五月中旬以后，和平乡的农民发生了缺秧子的困难，这是由于群众把“少秧密植”搞成了“多秧密植”造成的。普选工作组研究了这一情况，觉得必须钻到生产中去，具体帮助群众搞生产，才能使普选工作顺利进行。于是，他们便抓住了缺秧问题，向群众进行耐心的宣传教育，说明“少秧密植”的好处，纠正浪费秧子的现象。这样，在群众自愿的基础上匀出多余的秧子，进行调剂，不但解决了缺秧的困难，扩大了栽秧面积，同时也推广了少秧密植的先进生产技术。螺丝村全村六十四户中，有十六户农民缺秧，经调剂后都及时插了秧。六月初，全乡又呈现了旱象，选举工作组及时帮助乡干部领导全乡农民进行了抗旱保苗工作，并深入动员群众克服麻痹思想，投入抗旱工作。在很短的时间内，全乡基本上战胜了旱灾，使许多枯萎的秧子发了青。农民的生产困难解决了，接着就抓紧生产空隙进行人口调查、选民登记等工作。这种作法得到了农民群众的赞同和拥护，效果很好。许多农民向选举工作组的干部表示，他们不再认为搞普选会影响生产了。工作组的同志们也都深深感到：选举工作组同时应该是一个生产工作组，只有这样才能使群众满意，才能把普选工作搞好。
