In order to implement the decision of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry on improving coal quality, the Coal Mine Management Bureau, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration, and the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee have jointly formed a coal quality inspection team, which has begun to conduct inspections in various coal mines in Northeast China. The purpose of this inspection is to reverse the concept of neglecting quality in Northeast coal mines, establish and improve a series of quality responsibility systems, mobilize all employees to carry out quality competitions, and enhance and strengthen the confidence of coal preparation workers in improving coal production quality, so as to ensure the completion or overfulfillment of the quality standards required by the state.

In other news: The leaders of Hegang Mining Bureau have reversed their thinking of emphasizing quantity over quality, and have effectively improved coal quality. The coal quality in April and May has greatly improved. In May, 70 percent of raw coal from pit mouths was directly transported and sold, saving coal preparation costs and eliminating the phenomenon of unsold coal due to poor quality, which affected capital turnover.

Before March of this year, the Bureau's coal quality was poor, and the ash content in the coal greatly exceeded the contractual stipulations. Only 49 percent of the coal produced at the pit mouths of the Bureau met the required quality standards for direct transport and sale. The quality of the remaining coal was very poor. Some consignees demanded returns, while others refused to pay. In March, due to poor coal quality, consignees refused to accept the goods, which once affected the turnover of 2.4 billion yuan of capital.

In March, the Hegang Mining Bureau began to improve coal quality, placing the laboratory screening test inspection team under the direct leadership of the Business Section, so that transportation and sales could directly control quality. After the Business Section directly took control of screening tests, a product quality inspection team was established, with five inspectors regularly inspecting pit mouths in various mines and thirteen workers conducting screening outside the pits. The inspection team formulated management and inspection systems. Each time a new site was opened for mining, the inspection team signed a coal quality appraisal contract with each pit. The inspectors went into the pits to focus on inspecting site conditions, mining methods, and whether attention was paid to quality, and discussed measures to improve coal quality with pit shifts and team leaders (such as improving operating methods, improving various systems, and mobilizing employees to jointly improve quality). In the work of improving coal quality, Party members, Youth League members, and trade union cadres have played a leading role, and criticism and commendation work has been fully carried out. When Liu Xiangshan's team in Xingshan No. 1 Mine loaded large pieces of gangue, Liu Tingyou, chairman of the trade union, immediately conducted criticism and education. In the patriotic labor competition of Red May, the mine also organized coal inspectors from various mines and pit mouths and dispatchers from the Transportation Section to carry out a mobile red flag competition for production, transportation, and sales. Each mine inspected the quality of each other. During the competition, Zhao Kuiling, a coal inspector from Dongshan, created a method of communication by passing notes up and down the pit, so that the mining team leader could promptly notify the pit coal inspector and the Transportation Section of the site conditions and output, so as to flexibly dispatch vehicles. Through the competition, Dongshan had only six freight cars parked in twenty days, a decrease of 33 percent compared with March; the gangue content was reduced to meet the required standards. In May, more than two-thirds of the pit mouths no longer needed to go through the selection process for raw coal, but were directly transported and sold. In April and May, a total of 458.8 million yuan was saved in coal preparation costs for the state, and the phenomenon of unsold coal due to poor quality, which affected capital turnover, disappeared.

Under the influence of leaders emphasizing quality, a good atmosphere of paying attention to quality has been initially established in various mines. For example, Xingshan No. 1 and No. 2 Mines, Nanshan No. 4 and No. 5 Mines, and Dongshan No. 1 and No. 3 Mines all discussed how to improve quality when discussing work plans in early June and formulated specific measures. Xingshan No. 2 Mine also invited coal inspectors to participate in the meeting of team and group leaders. The result of the Bureau's improvement of quality did not affect the completion of production tasks. In some mines and pits, coal quality was also improved, costs were reduced, and labor efficiency was also significantly improved, achieving a balanced monthly completion of the plan. (Wang Xunda)

    东北组织检查组帮助各矿改进煤的质量
    鹤岗矿务局为改进煤的质量采取了具体办法
    为贯彻中央燃料工业部关于改进燃煤质量的决定，煤矿管理总局、东北煤矿管理局和东北财政经济委员会已联合组成了煤的质量检查小组，开始深入东北各煤矿进行检查。这次检查的目的是为了扭转东北各煤矿不重视质量的观念，建立与健全一系列的质量责任制度，发动全体职工开展质量竞赛，提高并加强选煤工作人员对提高产煤质量的信心，以保证完成或超额完成国家所要求的质量标准。
    又讯：鹤岗矿务局领导方面扭转了重量不重质的思想，切实改进煤质，四、五月份煤质大大提高。五月份已有百分之七十坑口原煤直接运销，节省了选煤费用，消灭了因煤质低劣滞销影响资金周转现象。
    该局在今年三月份以前，产煤质量低劣，煤中的灰分大大超过合同规定，该局只有百分之四十九的坑口，其所产的煤的质量符合要求标准能直接运销。其余的煤质都很差，货主们有的要求退货，有的拒绝付款，三月份因煤质低劣，货主不收，一次就影响了二十四亿元资金的周转。
    鹤岗矿务局于三月间着手改进煤的质量，把化验室筛别试验检查组划给营业科直接领导，使运销直接掌握质量。营业科直接掌握筛别试验后，成立了产品质量检查组，五个检查员定期到各矿坑口检查，十三个工人分别在坑外筛别。检查组制定了管理、检查制度，每次新场子开采，检查组都和各坑签订煤质鉴定合同。检查员到坑内着重检查场子情况、采煤方法和是否注意质量，并和坑班、组长共同讨论提高煤质的措施（如改进操作方法，健全各种制度、发动职工共同改进质量等）在改进煤质工作中，党员、团员及工会干部都起了带头作用，并充分地展开了批评与表扬的工作。兴山一坑刘向山小组装了大块矸子石，工会主席刘廷有发现后，当即进行批评教育。该矿在红五月爱国主义劳动竞赛中，又组织了各矿、坑口检煤员和车务段调度员，开展产运销流动红旗竞赛，各矿相互检查质量，竞赛中东山检煤员赵魁令创造了坑上下纸条通讯办法，采煤班长及时把场子面情况、产量通知坑上检煤员，通知车务段灵活调车。通过竞赛，东山在二十天中货车仅停留六台，较三月份减少百分之三十三；含矸率降低到符合要求标准。五月份有三分之二以上的坑口，原煤不必经过入选手续，直接运销，四、五两个月合计，给国家节省选煤费用四亿五千八百多万元，因煤质低劣滞销影响资金周转的现象也没有了。
    在领导重视质量的影响下，各矿已经初步树立了重视质量的风气，如兴山一坑、二坑，南山四、五坑，东山一、三坑，六月初讨论作业计划时都讨论了如何提高质量问题，订出了具体措施。兴山二坑召开班、组长会议时也吸收检煤员参加。该局提高质量的结果并未影响产量任务的完成，有的矿坑，煤质还提高了，成本降低了，劳动效率也有显著的提高，达到了均衡地按月完成计划。（王训达）
