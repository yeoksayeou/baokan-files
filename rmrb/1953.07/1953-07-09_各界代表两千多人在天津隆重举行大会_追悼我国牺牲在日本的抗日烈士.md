Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 8th: A memorial meeting for the anti-Japanese martyrs of our country who sacrificed in Japan was grandly held in Tianjin today.

From seven o'clock in the morning, people attending the memorial service silently entered the venue, wearing black gauze armbands. Those attending the memorial service included Liao Chengzhi, Zhong Bingchang representing the Chinese People's Liberation Army, He Jifeng, a general who participated in the famous Battle of Xifengkou, Wu Yannong, chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, as well as heads of various people's organizations in Tianjin, workers, PLA soldiers, students, citizens, and representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors and religious circles, totaling more than two thousand people. Also attending the memorial service were family members of the anti-Japanese martyrs who sacrificed in Japan, representatives of prisoners of war and survivors of forced labor during the Anti-Japanese War, and many overseas Chinese who had just returned from Japan.

The memorial meeting venue was decorated solemnly and respectfully. Above the mourning hall hung a banner that read "Eternal Glory to the Anti-Japanese Martyrs." In the center were placed the memorial tablets of the martyrs and the urns containing their ashes wrapped in white cloth. Both sides were filled with wreaths presented by various circles. Units presenting wreaths included the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Red Cross Society of China, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Medical Association, the China People's Relief Administration, the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches of China, the China Islamic Association, the Buddhist Association of China, the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Association, as well as the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, the Tianjin Municipal People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee, various people's organizations, factories, schools, and institutions in Tianjin, totaling more than one hundred and forty units.

At nine o'clock in the morning, the memorial service began amidst mournful music.

Wu Yannong, chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, reported on the details of the Hanaoka Massacre, followed by a speech by Liao Chengzhi. Liao Chengzhi said: Today, with extremely sorrowful and angry feelings, we commemorate the anti-Japanese martyrs who were murdered by Japanese militarists in Hanaoka and other places during the Anti-Japanese War. This is a blood debt, and this blood debt, along with other heinous crimes of Japanese militarists, is something that every Chinese person can never forget. American imperialism has already released a large number of Japanese war criminals, but we believe that Japanese war criminals and the murderers of anti-Japanese martyrs will one day be brought to justice. Liao Chengzhi said: At today's memorial service, what we must seriously be vigilant about is that after Japanese imperialism was defeated, Japanese militarists were not eliminated. Under the protection and support of American warmongers, they have not only not received due punishment, but are also attempting to restore their strength. They are forming an alliance with American aggressors, preparing to launch a new war of aggression. Under the rule of American imperialism and the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan, Japan is increasingly becoming a military base; Japanese industry is engaged in arms production; and under the name of "security forces," Japan's aggressive army is being established. The Yoshida government of Japan has even concluded a so-called "peace treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, openly antagonizing our People's Republic of China. The revival of Japanese militarist forces is a serious threat to Asia, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people, who have suffered the longest and deepest from Japanese militarist aggression. Liao Chengzhi finally said: The peace-loving people of Japan are becoming increasingly aware that Japanese militarists are not only the enemies of the people of Asia and China, but also the enemies of the Japanese people. The Japanese people's struggle against militarism, against new wars of aggression, and for independence, democracy, and peace is developing day by day. Peace-loving Japanese organizations and people have actively discovered the remains of Chinese anti-Japanese martyrs in various parts of Japan, and together with patriotic overseas Chinese in Japan, they have overcome various obstacles from the reactionary Yoshida government to send the martyrs' remains back to China. This shows the great determination of the Japanese people to oppose the revival of militarism. Here, we express our gratitude to all peace-loving Japanese organizations and people, as well as our patriotic overseas Chinese.

Zhong Bingchang, representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spoke. He said: We Chinese people have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression for as long as fifty years. In the past eight years of the Japanese militarist government's war of aggression against China, more than ten million Chinese people died as a result of the war, and public and private property losses amounted to 50 billion US dollars. The Hanaoka Incident is one example that cannot be forgotten. He said: Precisely because the Chinese people have fresh memories of the disaster of Japanese imperialist aggression against China, they express firm opposition to the current policy of American imperialism to arm Japan and attempt to revive Japanese militarism to launch a war of aggression. We also firmly oppose the policy of the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan to collude with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang to antagonize the People's Republic of China.

He Jifeng, an anti-Japanese general, spoke. He pointed out: The revelation of the Hanaoka Massacre once again proves that Japanese militarism is not only the enemy of the Chinese people but also the enemy of the Japanese people. Although the American occupation authorities, the Japanese government, and the Chiang Kai-shek gang colluded with each other, shamelessly attempting to cover up the truth of the massacre and doing everything possible to prevent the martyrs' remains from being sent back to China, the remains of the martyrs were finally able to return to the motherland thanks to the investigation, pursuit, and struggle of our patriotic overseas Chinese in Japan, Japanese democratic organizations, and peace-loving people. This fully demonstrates the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Liu Baojin, a worker at the Yaohua Glass Factory in Qinhuangdao and a representative of the martyrs' families, spoke. He recounted the ordeal of his father, Liu Jichun, who was captured by the Japanese invaders to work as a forced laborer and was brutally murdered, as well as the facts of many others being tortured to death. He said with indignation: We will never forget these many inhumane crimes of Japanese militarism. Liu Baojin said: We clearly know that the reactionary Japanese government and the peace-loving Japanese people are two different things; the assistance of the peace-loving Japanese people to overseas Chinese organizations in Japan in sending the remains back to China is a very good proof. He also hoped that the Japanese and Chinese people would work together to stop the revival of Japanese militarism.

Yang Junjie, a representative of survivors of capture and forced labor by the Japanese invaders, exposed the various crimes committed by the Japanese invaders in torturing and killing the Chinese people based on his own experience. He also firmly stated: We must inherit the legacy of the martyrs and, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, work hard to participate in national construction and build our motherland into a stronger and more prosperous country.

中山理理 (Nakayama Riri), head of the "Chinese Martyrs' Remains Escort Group," spoke. He said: During the Pacific War, from 1942 to 1945, Japan kidnapped 38,935 Chinese soldiers, farmers, workers, and businessmen to Japan. After suffering from hunger, cold, and various unspeakable forms of torture, 6,830 people had already sacrificed their lives. The remains of the martyrs unearthed this time in Hanaoka, Osarizawa, Kosaka and other places in Akita Prefecture, Japan, were sacrificed under such tragic circumstances. The Japanese people are solemnly consoling the spirits of the other remains and will send them back as soon as possible. Nakayama Riri said: We Japanese people will never engage in war again. We want to build a great wall on Asian soil to prevent war, to comfort the heroic souls in heaven.

林炳松 (Lin Bingsong), representative of the "Overseas Chinese Escort Group for the Martyred Heroes' Souls," said in his speech: For the sake of democracy and peace, overseas Chinese in Japan must, like our compatriots in the motherland, unite with the Japanese people and promote greater strength based on the motherland's great peace policy, in order to send all the martyrs' remains back to the motherland.

金一秀 (Kim Il-soo), representative of the "Chinese Martyrs' Remains Escort Group," and the first person to expose the Hanaoka Massacre, a Korean resident in Japan, spoke. He first said: Now the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are united and fighting for the opposition of wars of aggression and for peace in Asia and the world. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people. After Kim Il-soo reported on the process of him and Korean residents in Japan actively assisting overseas Chinese in Japan in investigating the remains of anti-Japanese martyrs, he said: In Japan, there are still a large number of martyrs' remains, and this number is probably no less than about 10,000. Kim Il-soo also pointed out that not only are there the remains of Chinese martyrs, but also the remains of Korean martyrs. He and Korean residents in Japan will certainly continue to work together with overseas Chinese in Japan and peace-loving people in Japan to strive to transport the remaining martyrs' remains back to China, and also to strive to transport the remains of Korean martyrs back to his motherland - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The memorial service ended at about eleven o'clock amidst mournful music.

    各界代表两千多人在天津隆重举行大会
    追悼我国牺牲在日本的抗日烈士
    【新华社天津八日电】我国牺牲在日本的抗日烈士追悼大会，八日在天津市隆重举行。
    从早晨七点钟，参加追悼大会的人们臂戴着黑纱，默默地走入会场。参加追悼大会的有廖承志，有中国人民解放军的代表钟炳昌，有曾经参加过著名的喜峰口抗战的将领何基沣，有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会天津市分会主席吴砚农，以及天津市各人民团体的负责人、工人、解放军战士、学生、市民和工商界、宗教界人士等共两千多人。参加追悼大会的还有牺牲在日本的抗日烈士的家属、抗日战争中被俘和被强征后生还者的代表，还有刚从日本回国的华侨多人。
    追悼大会的会场布置得庄严肃穆，灵台的上面挂着“抗日烈士永垂不朽”的横幅，正中安放着烈士的灵牌和用白布包扎着的骨灰匣，两旁放满了各界敬献的花圈。敬献花圈的单位有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、中国红十字会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民解放军、中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、中华医学会、中国人民救济总会、中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动筹备委员会、中国伊斯兰教协会、中国佛教协会、北京归国华侨联谊会，以及中共天津市委员会、天津市人民政府、天津市各界人民代表会议协商委员会，天津市各人民团体、工厂、学校、机关等共一百四十多个单位。
    上午九时，在哀乐声中，追悼大会开始。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会天津市分会主席吴砚农报告了花冈惨案的经过后，即由廖承志讲话。廖承志说：今天我们怀着十分悲痛和愤怒的心情，追悼在抗日战争期间在日本花冈等地被日本军国主义分子所杀害的抗日烈士。这是一笔血债，这笔血债和日本军国主义分子的其他滔天罪行，同样地是每个中国人民所永远不能忘记的。美帝国主义已经释放了大批日本战犯，但是我们相信日本战犯和杀害抗日烈士的凶手们总有一天要受到正义的制裁。廖承志说：在今天的追悼会上，使我们不得不严重警惕的就是：在日本帝国主义被击败之后，日本军国主义分子没有被肃清。他们在美国战争贩子的庇护和扶植下，不仅没有受到应有的惩办，却正企图恢复自己的力量。他们正和美国侵略者结成同盟，准备进行新的侵略战争。在美帝国主义和日本吉田反动政府统治下，日本正日益变成军事基地；日本的工业正在从事军火生产；在“保安队”的名义下，日本的侵略军队正建立中。日本的吉田政府更和蒋匪帮缔结所谓“和约”，公开地与我中华人民共和国为敌。日本军国主义势力的复活对亚洲是一个严重的威胁，这是遭受日本军国主义侵略时间最长、战祸最深的中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。廖承志最后说：日本爱好和平的人民一天比一天更清楚地认识到，日本军国主义分子不仅是亚洲和中国人民的敌人，同时也是日本人民的敌人。日本人民反对军国主义，反对新的侵略战争，争取独立、民主、和平的斗争正日益开展。日本爱好和平的团体和人士积极地在日本各地发现中国抗日烈士的遗骨，并且和爱国旅日华侨在一起，克服吉田反动政府的种种阻挠，把烈士遗骨送回中国来，这事正表明了日本人民反对军国主义复活的巨大决心。我们在这里向爱好和平的日本各团体和人士，以及我国爱国华侨致谢。
    中国人民解放军代表钟炳昌讲话。他说：我们中国人民过去受日本帝国主义者侵略之害，达五十年之久。在过去日本军国主义政府八年侵华战争中，中国人民因战争而死亡的就有一千万人以上，公私财产损失达五百亿美元。花冈事件就是其中不能令人忘记的一个例子。他说：正由于中国人民对于日本帝国主义侵略中国的灾难记忆犹新，因而对于目前美帝国主义武装日本、企图复活日本军国主义发动侵略战争的政策，表示坚决反对。我们也坚决反对日本吉田反动政府勾结美帝国主义和蒋匪帮敌视中华人民共和国的政策。
    抗日将领何基沣讲话。他指出：花冈惨案的揭露，再一次证明了日本军国主义不仅是中国人民同时也是日本人民的敌人。尽管美国占领当局、日本政府和蒋介石匪帮互相勾结，无耻地企图掩盖惨案真象，并多方阻止烈士遗骨送回中国，然而在我旅日爱国华侨、日本民主团体和和平人士的调查、追究和斗争之下，终于使烈士们的遗骨得以安归祖国，这就充分表现了中日两国人民的友谊与合作。
    烈士家属代表、秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂工人刘宝印讲话，他叙述了他的父亲刘继春被日寇抓去作苦工后惨遭虐杀的经过，以及其他许多人被虐杀的事实。他激愤地说：日本军国主义这许许多多灭绝人性的罪行，我们永远忘不了。刘宝印说：我们清楚地知道，日本反动政府和爱好和平的日本人民是两回事；日本爱好和平的人民协助旅日华侨团体把遗骨送回中国，就是一个很好的证明。他并希望日本人民和中国人民共同努力，制止日本军国主义的复活。
    被日寇俘掳和强征后生还者的代表杨俊杰以他自己的经历，揭露了日寇虐杀中国人民的种种罪行。他并坚决表示：一定要继承烈士们的遗志，在毛主席和共产党的英明领导下，努力参加国家建设，把祖国建设得更富强。
        “中国人殉难者遗骨护送团”团长中山理理讲话。他说：日本在太平洋战争中从一九四二年到一九四五年，曾从中国绑架三万八千九百三十五名中国军人、农民、工人、商人等到日本。他们受尽了饥寒交迫和非言语所能形容的各种虐待之后，有六千八百三十人已经牺牲。此次在日本秋田县的花冈、尾去泽、小坂等地所掘出来的烈士遗骨，就是在这种悲惨的情况下牺牲的。其他那些遗骨，日本人民正在郑重地慰灵，并予早日送回。中山理理说：我们日本人民今后决不从事战争。我们要在亚洲人的国土上建筑起一条杜绝战争的大墙，以此告慰在天英灵。
    “殉难英灵留日华侨护送团”代表林炳松讲话中表示：为了民主、和平，旅日华侨一定和祖国同胞一样，本着祖国伟大的和平政策，团结日本人民，推动更大的力量，把全部烈士遗骨送回祖国。
        “中国人殉难者遗骨护送团”代表、即揭发花冈惨案的第一人、旅日朝鲜侨民金一秀讲话。他首先说：现在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军团结一致，为了反对侵略战争、为了亚洲和全世界和平而战斗着。我谨向中国人民表示衷心的谢意。金一秀报告了他和旅日朝鲜侨民积极协助旅日华侨调查抗日烈士遗骨的经过后说：在日本，还有大量的烈士遗骨，这数目恐怕不下于一万左右。金一秀并指出，不仅有中国烈士的遗骨，同时也有朝鲜烈士的遗骨。他和旅日朝鲜侨民一定继续和在日华侨、日本爱好和平的人民共同努力，争取将其余的烈士遗骨运回中国，同时也要争取把朝鲜烈士的遗骨运回他的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    追悼大会于十一时许在哀乐声中结束。
