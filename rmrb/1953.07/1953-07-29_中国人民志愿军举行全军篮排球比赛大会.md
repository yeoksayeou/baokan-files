    Chinese People's Volunteer Army Holds All-Army Basketball and Volleyball Tournament
    After two months of preparation, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army All-Army Basketball and Volleyball Tournament was held in a certain area from the end of June to mid-July. This tournament was large in scale, with participating teams from the Volunteer Army's infantry, air force, artillery, tank corps, engineering corps, railway corps, logistics units, and directly subordinate organs of the Volunteer Army Headquarters and Political Department. There were thirty-one men's basketball teams, fourteen women's basketball teams, thirty men's volleyball teams, and thirteen women's volleyball teams. The athletes included cadres and soldiers, commanders and technical workers. Female athletes accounted for 30 percent of all athletes.
    The tournament lasted for fourteen days, and the results showed that the Volunteer Army had made good achievements in developing combat-oriented, mass sports activities. The overall basketball and volleyball skills of the army have greatly improved compared to the selection competition held in June last year. At that time, referees still needed to explain the rules for six-player volleyball matches, and no basketball team could master the "fast break" technique, but now things are completely different. In this competition, the scores in basketball games generally approached or exceeded 100 points, with the highest reaching 167 points, and women's basketball teams could also score close to 80 points. Volleyball teams have also strengthened collective coordination and mastered the spiking technique. Throughout the competition, the spirit of unity, friendship, and eagerness to learn was upheld. During the tournament, athletes from various teams improved their skills through seminars, reports, and performances by outstanding teams. For example, before the tournament, not a single player on the Air Force women's volleyball team could spike, but due to their hard work and diligent practice, they developed offensive strength in the later stages of the tournament and won the Group A championship in women's volleyball. In the competition, all teams demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism and a tenacious fighting spirit.
    This All-Army Basketball and Volleyball Tournament was highly valued by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters. The tournament was conducted under the guidance of Chief of Staff Xie Fang. Xie Fang also gave a summary report at the closing ceremony, calling on all commanders and fighters to seize the gaps in time in the future, and to carry out sports activities suitable for the needs of various services and arms in an organized and led manner through various methods. He further advocated basketball and volleyball, so that they would gradually become regular, conscious, and mass activities in the troops. At the closing ceremony, Xie Fang presented award flags and prizes to the 24 basketball and volleyball champion, runner-up, and other outstanding teams.
    The conference also received a large number of congratulatory letters, banners, and gifts sent by the people of the motherland. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国人民志愿军举行全军篮排球比赛大会
    中国人民志愿军全军篮、排球比赛大会经过二个月的筹备，已自六月底到七月中旬在某地举行。这次大会规模盛大，参加大会的有来自志愿军步兵部队、空军部队、炮兵部队、坦克部队、工兵部队、铁道部队、后勤部队等各兵种以及志愿军司令部、政治部直属机关的代表队。其中有三十一个男子篮球队、十四个女子篮球队、三十个男子排球队和十三个女子排球队。运动员中有干部，也有战士；有指挥员，也有技术工作者。女运动员占了全体运动员的百分之三十。
    大会共进行十四天，比赛结果显示了志愿军在开展战斗性、群众性的体育运动方面，已经有了良好的成绩。全军的篮、排球技术已比去年六月间举行选拔比赛时大大提高了一步。当时六人排球比赛还需要裁判员先讲解规则，篮球没有一个队能掌握“快攻”技术，现在已完全不同了。这次比赛中篮球的比赛成绩一般能接近或超过一百分，最高的能打到一百六十七分，女子篮球队也能打到接近八十分。排球队也都加强了集体联系和掌握了扣杀球技术。比赛大会始终贯彻了团结友爱和虚心学习的精神。在大会进行中，各队运动员通过座谈会、报告会和优秀球队的表演，提高了球技。如空军女子排球队在大会开幕前没有一个人能杀球，但由于她们的勤学苦练，在大会后期培养了进攻力量，获得了女子排球的甲组冠军。在比赛中，各代表队都发扬了高度的革命英雄主义精神和顽强的战斗作风。
    这次全军篮、排球比赛大会得到中国人民志愿军司令部的重视。比赛大会在参谋长解方指导下进行。解方并在大会闭幕式上做了总结报告，他号召全军指挥员、战斗员今后应抓紧空隙时间，通过各种方法有组织有领导地开展适合各兵种需要的体育活动，进一步提倡篮、排球运动，使之逐步地成为部队中经常地、自觉地、群众性的活动。在闭幕会上解方将奖旗和奖品发给篮、排球冠军、亚军和其他优秀单位的二十四个球队。
    大会还收到了大批从祖国人民寄来的贺信、锦旗和礼品。（新华社）
