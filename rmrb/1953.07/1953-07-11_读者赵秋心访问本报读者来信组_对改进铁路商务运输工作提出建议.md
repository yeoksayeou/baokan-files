    Reader Zhao Qiuxin Visits the People's Daily Reader Letters Group
    Suggests Improvements to Railway Commercial Transportation Work

    On June 29th, Zhao Qiuxin, Deputy Section Chief of the Accident Compensation Section of the Commercial Department of the Beijing Railway Bureau, visited the reader letters group of this newspaper to report on the increasing number of commercial accidents since the implementation of responsible transportation by the national railways, and put forward some suggestions for improving commercial transportation work. We believe that the situation and opinions reflected by Comrade Zhao Qiuxin are worthy of attention, and we hope that the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government will study and respond. The following is the situation reflected by Zhao Qiuxin and his opinions:

    Since the beginning of this year, when the national railways implemented responsible transportation, thanks to the efforts of the vast number of railway employees and the support of the customers, many achievements have been made in the past six months; however, due to insufficient attention to this work by some leading comrades of the railway department, and insufficient understanding of the political and economic significance of responsible transportation by many railway employees, many serious commercial accidents have also occurred. Most railway administrations (hereinafter referred to as bureaus) across the country have seen a monthly increase in accidents since January of this year. For example, the commercial records compiled by the Taiyuan Bureau (these records are the basic materials to prove the responsibility for transportation between the railway and the cargo owner) numbered 292 in January, 320 in February, 361 in March, 489 in April, and 701 in May. Since January, the Shanghai Bureau alone has had more than 2,400 cases forming accidents. The Tianjin Bureau compiled a total of 8,234 commercial records from January to May; after analysis and investigation, the amount of compensation to be paid by the railway from January to April was nearly 80 million yuan, and the figure for May was even larger, with the Fengtai fire alone estimated to have caused losses of more than 300 million yuan. The number of responsibility accidents in the Beijing Bureau is also quite alarming, with the number of accidents in April increasing fourfold compared to January.

    Among so many accidents, the vast majority are not unavoidable natural disasters, but the result of a small number of employees violating regulations, working carelessly, and not cherishing national property enough. For example, on May 7th this year, a full wagon of less-than-carload (LCL) cargo shipped from Tianjin Station to Taiyuan North Station caught fire due to the oilcloth packaging on the wagon not being suitable for the nature of the cargo, and the weigher loaded it into the wagon without inspection, causing the country to suffer hundreds of millions of yuan in losses. Once, the Guang'anmen Station in Beijing loaded a full LCL wagon for Zhengzhou and Hankou Stations, mixing 666 insecticide powder with apples, fresh ginger, broad beans, and other food items. The Andingmen Station in Beijing once confused the cargo owners of 28 tons of steel bars and two wagons of wood, and allowed another unit to take the goods without going through the formalities when the shipping unit came to pick up the goods; by the time the station discovered the error and moved the goods back, 4 million yuan in handling fees had been wasted and the cargo owner was very dissatisfied. In addition, many weighers knowingly enter into so-called "exemption agreements" of "self-responsibility for leakage" with cargo owners, and accept cargo with poor packaging, in the old railway style of not being responsible for cargo, resulting in accidents en route. Many commercial employees also cause many accidents of spoilage, theft, damage, missing items, and insufficient weight due to improper storage after the goods arrive at the station, insufficient attention to the integrity of the goods during loading and unloading, and unclear item checking, causing great losses to the country and damaging the reputation of the people's railway; this should never be allowed to continue!

    Based on my understanding, the main reasons for the above situation are:

    First, many railway commercial employees currently have a negative attitude of valuing vehicle operations over commercial operations, and some individual employees even mistakenly believe that commercial work is "more work, less rest, low wages, few rewards, narrow prospects, and no future." Therefore, they are not enthusiastic about their work. They do not understand that the people's railway's commercial transportation work plays a significant role in national construction. The motherland is advancing, and the future of the people's railway's commercial employees is bright. There are many experts in Soviet railway commercial work, and Comrade Yang Maolin is a model worker on the Chinese railway—a banner for commercial workers.

    Second, the atmosphere of studying business and learning regulations is very poor among commercial employees, so violations of regulations naturally occur in the work process. At the same time, some units do not implement Comrade Yang Maolin's advanced working methods in a pragmatic manner, but adopt a formalistic and perfunctory attitude; this also creates conditions for the occurrence of accidents.

    Third, individual employees lack the idea of cherishing national property and are irresponsible in their work. The leadership also fails to conduct education on cherishing state property and researching ways to prevent accidents through concrete facts after accidents occur, which leads these employees to mistakenly believe that "commercial accidents are not as serious as vehicle operation accidents, and not much money will be compensated," and they are numb to accidents.

    Fourth, the organization, equipment, and system of railway units have not been correspondingly improved since the implementation of responsible transportation, and many units have poor communication with cargo owners.

    Fifth, the most critical issue is that some leaders of railway units do not pay attention to commercial work and have serious bureaucratic work styles. They sing the praises of planned management, but fail to see the chaotic and passive situation existing in commercial work; they emphasize economic accounting, but fail to see the losses that freight accidents bring to the railway. They do not study or solve the personnel, education, and reward and punishment issues existing in commercial work, and turn a deaf ear to the increasing number of public opinions. Some on-site leaders even let those employees in the commercial employees who are proactive and conscientious in their work switch to other jobs, and conversely send some people they consider "not ideal" to work in the commercial departments. This situation seriously affects the progress of commercial work!

    In order to improve commercial work and implement responsible transportation, I suggest:

    First, the party organizations and trade unions of the railway system should vigorously strengthen the political and ideological education of commercial employees, so that they can establish the master's sense of responsibility for cherishing state property. The railway administrative leaders should strengthen the leadership and inspection of commercial work, promptly summarize the inventions, creations, and advanced experiences in commercial work, strictly enforce the reward and punishment system, rectify labor discipline, and eliminate unhealthy ideological sentiments among commercial employees.

    Second, strengthen the business education of commercial employees. Hold short-term training classes, regulation explanation meetings, etc. without hindering normal business operations. Establish and improve the business learning system, improve the professional level of employees, and eliminate the responsibility accidents caused by illegal operations.

    Third, the administration should conduct key inspections of stations and sections where accidents occur frequently, help them find the causes of the accidents, study preventive measures, and formulate guarantee conditions. This is a relatively effective way to reduce accidents.

    Fourth, improve freight yard equipment, management, and the organization and allocation of commercial equipment. Strictly enforce the handover system. Strengthen communication with cargo owners. Strengthen supervision and resolutely fight against all behaviors that violate regulations and fail to earnestly implement Yang Maolin's advanced loading methods!

    Finally, the implementation of responsible transportation requires the joint efforts of both the railway and the cargo owner. Currently, a small number of cargo owners do not package their goods well when shipping them, which easily leads to commercial accidents; some cargo owners also delay picking up their goods after receiving the arrival notice, which occupies cargo spaces, causing later-arriving goods to be stored in the open air, which not only easily causes accidents, but also prolongs the vehicle's stop time, affecting the transportation plan. It is hoped that the majority of cargo owners will pay attention to avoiding the above situations in the future and assist the railway in doing a good job in transportation.

    读者赵秋心访问本报读者来信组
    对改进铁路商务运输工作提出建议
    六月二十九日，北京铁路局商务处事故赔偿科副科长赵秋心访问本报读者来信组，反映全国铁路实行负责运输后商务事故增多的情况，并提出了对改进商务运输工作的一些意见。我们认为：赵秋心同志反映的情况和意见都是值得重视的，希望中央人民政府铁道部研究答复。以下是赵秋心反映的情况和他的意见：
    今年元旦起全国铁路实行了负责运输，由于广大铁路员工的努力和顾主的支持，半年来已经收到了不少成绩；但是由于铁路部门某些领导同志对此工作重视不足，不少铁路员工对负责运输的政治意义和经济意义认识不够，也发生了很多严重的商务事故。全国大多数的铁路管理局（以下简称局）今年一月以来事故逐月增多。如太原局编制的商务记录
    （该记录是证明铁路与货主间在运送责任上的基本材料），一月份是二百九十二件，二月份是三百二十件，三月份是三百六十一件，四月份是四百八十九件，五月份则为七百零一件。上海局一月以来仅形成事故的就有二千四百多件。天津局一月至五月共编制商务记录八千二百三十四件；经过分析调查后弄清责任而应由铁路赔偿的款额一月至四月就将近八千万元，五月份数字更大，只丰台火灾一案，据初步估计损失即达三亿多元。北京局责任事故也相当惊人，四月份的事故数目比一月份就增加四倍。
    这么多的事故中，绝大部分是并非不可避免的自然灾害，而是少数员工违犯规章、工作粗枝大叶和对国家资财不够爱护的结果。如今年五月七日由天津站发太原北站一车整车零担货物，因为车上的油布包装不适合货物性质的需要，而司磅员未经检查混装车内，以致货物磨擦自燃，使国家遭受了数亿元的损失。北京广安门站有一次装给郑州、汉口两站的整零车中，将六六六杀虫粉和苹果、鲜姜、莞豆等食品混装一起。北京安定门车站曾把二十八吨钢筋和两车木板的货主搞错了，托运单位来拉货时该站不办手续，却让另一单位将货拉走；等车站发现错误把货物往回搬，已浪费了四百万元的搬运费并使货主很不满意。此外，不少司磅员明知货物包装不好，却以旧铁路对货物不负责任的作风和货主订立了所谓“渗漏自负”的“免责特约”而承运，以致中途发生事故。不少商务员工在货物到站后保管不当，装卸车时对货物的完整注意不够，件数点检不清，也造成很多腐烂、被盗、破损，件数多、缺，重量不足的事故，给国家造成了很大的损失，并损害了人民铁路的信誉；这是决不应容许继续下去的！
    根据我的了解，造成以上情况的主要原因是：
    一，目前不少铁路商务员工有着一种轻商务、重车务的消极情绪，甚至有个别员工错误地认为商务工作是“工作多、休息少，工资低、奖励少，出路窄、没前途”。因此对工作不起劲。他们不了解：人民铁路的商务运输工作对国家建设有着重大的作用。祖国在前进，人民铁路的商务员工前途是广阔的。苏联铁路商务工作中有很多专家，杨茂林同志就是中国铁路的劳动模范——商务工作者的旗帜。
    二，商务员工中钻研业务、学习规章的空气很差，因此在作业过程中自然就产生了违犯规章的事情。同时某些单位对杨茂林同志的先进工作方法不是实事求是地执行，而采取了一种形式主义的应付态度；这也给事故的发生造成了条件。
    三，个别员工缺乏爱护国家资财的思想，工作不负责任。而领导方面在事故发生后也不通过具体事实向员工进行爱护国家财产的教育和研究防止事故的办法，致使这些员工错误地认为“商务事故没有车务事故严重，赔不了几个钱”，对事故麻木不仁。
    四，实行负责运输以后铁路单位的组织、设备、制度上没有相应地改进，不少单位对货主的联系很差。
    五，最关键的问题，是有些铁路单位的领导同志对商务工作不重视，工作中有严重的官僚主义作风。他们高唱计划管理，却看不到商务工作中存在着的紊乱被动局面；他们重视经济核算，却看不到货运事故给铁路带来的损失。他们对商务工作中存在的人事、教育、奖惩等问题不研究、不解决，对日益增多的群众意见置若罔闻。甚至现场有些领导同志看到商务员工中的工作积极认真负责的同志，就让他们改行作别的工作，相反地把一些被他们认为“不合理想”的人送到商务部门去工作。这种情况，严重地影响了商务工作的进展！
    为了改进商务工作，贯彻负责运输，我建议：
    一，铁路系统的党组织和工会应该大力加强对商务员工的政治思想教育，使他们树立爱护国家资财的主人翁思想。铁路行政领导方面应该加强对商务工作的领导和检查，及时总结商务工作中的发明创造和先进经验，严明奖惩制度，整饬劳动纪律，消除商务员工中不健康的思想情绪。
    二，加强对商务员工的业务教育。在不妨碍正常业务进行的情况下举办短期训练班、规章说明会等。建立和健全业务学习制度，提高职工业务水平，消灭违章作业所造成的责任事故。
    三，管理局对经常发生事故的站、段应作重点检查，帮助他们找出发生的原因，研究防止对策，订出保证条件。这对减少事故来说，比较是个行之有效的办法。
    四，改善货场设备、管理和商务用具的组织调拨工作。严格接交制度。加强和货主的联系。加强监察工作，向一切违犯规章、不认真执行杨茂林先进装车法的行为作坚决斗争！
    最后，贯彻负责运输是需要铁路和货主两方面共同努力的。目前有少数货主托运货物包装不好，这就容易发生商务事故；还有一些货主在接到货物到站通知后迟迟不领货，以致占用货位，使后到达的货物存放露天，不但容易造成事故，并且延长车辆停站时间，影响运输计划。希望今后广大货主注意避免以上情况，协助铁路方面做好运输工作。
