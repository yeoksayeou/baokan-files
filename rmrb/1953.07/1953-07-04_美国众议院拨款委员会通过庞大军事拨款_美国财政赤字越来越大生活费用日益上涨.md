Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd: Washington dispatch: The U.S. House Appropriations Committee passed on June 27th a $34,434,000,000 appropriation for the U.S. Department of Defense and the three services of the Army, Navy, and Air Force for the 1954 fiscal year, as funds to continue pushing forward the arms expansion and war preparation plan.

In its massive military appropriation, the House Appropriations Committee stipulated that $12,980,000,000 be allocated to the U.S. Army for the current year, with a special provision of $2 billion as "advance expenses" for the Korean War for the current year. The bill stipulates $9,380,000,000 for the Navy, $11,004,000,000 for the Air Force, and another $1,001,000,000 for the Secretary of Defense to allocate.

The military appropriation for the current year passed by the House Appropriations Committee is 15.4 percent less than the budget proposed by former President Truman. However, the committee emphasized in its report that with the new budget appropriation plus the balance of past appropriations, the military appropriation available to the Department of Defense would actually reach more than $91.9 billion. According to the Appropriations Committee, the actual plan of the U.S. Department of Defense is to spend $43.2 billion in the 1954 fiscal year, so the actual expenditure will exceed rather than decrease in the 1953 fiscal year.

In explaining the budget cuts, the Appropriations Committee also pointed out that the committee does not believe that the current amount of appropriations is sufficient for "security" needs, but only believes that it is necessary to avoid "the danger of economic unsustainable burden."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd: Washington dispatch: Although the U.S. government is currently levying unprecedentedly heavy taxes on the people, the fiscal deficit continues to increase due to the huge military expenditure. U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Republican Senator Taft recently revealed that the U.S. government's settlement of the 1953 fiscal year will have a "extremely serious" deficit.

According to Taft's estimate, in the 1953 fiscal year (ending June 30), the U.S. government's expenditure will exceed income by $9 billion. Such a huge deficit is $3 billion more than the estimate made by former President Truman at the beginning of this year, more than double the actual deficit in the 1952 fiscal year, and has reached the highest peak of government fiscal deficit in American history during peacetime. Taft also admitted that the Eisenhower Republican government will continue to have a huge deficit in the new fiscal year from July 1, 1953, to June 30, 1954, which may reach more than 7 billion. This will be much higher than the largest fiscal deficit in any year of the post-war Democratic government.

The huge fiscal deficit not only means that the federal government's current debt of more than $266 billion will further increase, but also inevitably increases the pressure of inflation. A senior U.S. government official admitted that in the next twelve months, "it will be very difficult to avoid some inflation."

The monthly consumer price index officially released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has risen for three consecutive months, and the index on May 15 has risen to 114 percent of the 1947-49 average. The most significant increases are in food and pharmaceutical products, which are most closely related to the lives of the American people.

    美国众议院拨款委员会通过庞大军事拨款
    美国财政赤字越来越大生活费用日益上涨
    【新华社二日讯】华盛顿消息：美国众议院拨款委员会六月二十七日通过在一九五四财政年度拨款三百四十四亿三千四百余万美元给美国国防部与海陆空三军，作为继续推行扩军备战计划的费用。
    众议院拨款委员会在它庞大的军事拨款中，规定在本年度拨款一百二十九亿八千余万美元给美国陆军，其中特别规定以二十亿美元作为本年度朝鲜战争的“预支费用”。法案规定拨给海军九十三亿八千余万美元，空军一百一十亿零四千余万美元，另拨给国防部长支配十亿零一千余万美元。
    众议院拨款委员会通过的本年度的军事拨款比前总统杜鲁门所提出的预算少百分之十五·四，但是该委员会在报告中着重指出，新预算拨款加上过去拨款的结余，国防部可以支用的军事拨款实际上将达九百一十九亿余美元。据拨款委员会说，美国国防部实际计划在一九五四财政年度支用的钱是四百三十二亿美元，因此实际开支将超过一九五三财政年度而不是减少。
    拨款委员会在解释预算削减的问题时还指出，委员会并不认为目前数目的拨款已经够“安全”的需要，而只是认为必须避免“经济承受不住负担的危险”。
    【新华社二日讯】华盛顿消息：尽管美国政府目前向人民征收空前沉重的捐税，由于军费开支庞大，财政赤字仍有增无已。美国参议院多数党领袖，共和党参议员塔夫脱最近透露，美国政府一九五三财政年度结算结果，将有“极其严重”的赤字。
    据塔夫脱估计，在一九五三财政年度（六月三十日结束）内，美国政府的支出将超过收入九十亿美元。这样庞大的赤字比前总统杜鲁门在今年年初的估计数字多三十亿美元，比一九五二财政年度的实际赤字多一倍以上，达到了和平期间美国历史上政府财政赤字的最高峰。塔夫脱还承认，艾森豪威尔共和党政府从一九五三年七月一日到一九五四年六月三十日为止的新会计年度中，将继续有庞大的赤字，为数可能达七十多亿。这将比战后民主党政府历年最大的财政赤字还高得多。
    巨大的财政赤字除了意味联邦政府目前已高达二千六百六十余亿美元的债务将会进一步增加以外，还不可避免地加重通货膨胀的压力。一个美国政府高级官员承认：在今后十二个月内，“要避免某种通货膨胀是十分困难的”。
    美国劳工统计局官方公布的每月消费品价格指数已连续上涨了三个月，到五月十五日的指数已升至一九四七—四九年平均数的百分之一百一十四。涨得最多的是与美国人民生活有最密切关系的食品和医药用品。
