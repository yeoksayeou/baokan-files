Introduction to the Xialianglian Village Credit Cooperative in Xiangyuan County
Han Fuwang

	From Small to Large, Progressing Step by Step

	Xialiang Village is a village with more than 400 households in the fifth district of Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province. Its agricultural production is mainly grain cultivation; its handicraft production includes old-fashioned iron stoves, ironwork, and carpentry; and its sideline production is mainly pig raising. In order to concentrate the idle funds of farmers to support agricultural, handicraft, and sideline production, a credit department was established in the village's supply and marketing cooperative at the end of 1950.

	When the credit department was first established, few farmers joined as shareholders. Farmers were afraid to deposit their surplus grain and money in the credit department. They were afraid that the credit department would not be trustworthy, that the deposited grain and money would be "nationalized," that depositing, withdrawing, and borrowing money would be inconvenient, and that depositing grain and money would result in losses. In response to these concerns, the credit department cadres decided to implement a "from small to large, gradually progressing" approach, educating the masses with practical examples. Farmer Li Xianbao, after repeated mobilization by the cadres, invested one share and deposited one dan of grain, but he was always skeptical. Before long, the credit department began to provide loans to support agricultural production, which he was very satisfied with, and he deposited another five dan of millet. Farmer Feng Chunhai deposited one dan of corn. Soon, he bought a cow, and his family had financial difficulties. The credit department loaned him four dan of millet, which solved his problem. He said: "The credit department is trustworthy, and I will deposit my surplus grain in the future." The credit department gained prestige, and its business became more active. In October 1951, the credit department was changed to a credit cooperative. Farmers increasingly felt that the credit cooperative had many benefits: storing physical objects yielded appropriate interest; decentralized storage on the spot enabled both lump-sum deposits and withdrawals and lump-sum loans and repayments within a limited period; and in case of special difficulties, loan repayment could be appropriately extended. Deposit what you like and withdraw what you like. Those who wish to exchange for other food grains can also be converted at fair market prices. Because all of this met the needs of the farmers, more and more people deposited grain and money. The masses said: "The credit cooperative has become a 'safe deposit box.'" According to statistics at the end of 1952, the credit cooperative had 545 households with more than 195,000 jin of surplus grain and 23.66 million yuan in deposits, an increase of three and a half times compared with 1951. Depositors accounted for 21.5 percent of the total number of households. Now this credit cooperative has expanded to the surrounding nine administrative villages and two natural villages, becoming a joint village credit cooperative with a total of 4,650 members.

	Concentrate Funds, Support Production

	The Xialianglian Village Credit Cooperative has vigorously organized the idle funds of farmers and has made great achievements in supporting the production of its members. Last year, the cooperative loaned 311.29 million yuan (including deposited grain, deposits, and shares) to 1,150 members, and established regular deposit and loan relationships with 129 mutual aid teams. It helped members purchase 45 new-style plows, 262 various old-style farm tools, 7 sprayers, 9 waterwheels, dig 6 wells, and open a canal, turning 300 mu of dry land into paddy fields. In addition, the cooperative also helped farmers purchase a large amount of fertilizer. Members purchased a total of 11,430 jin of sesame cake, 24,896 jin of bean cake, and 17,750 dan of sheep manure. The credit cooperative also helped 27 farming households solve their living difficulties, and another 15 farming households used loans to build and repair 48 houses. This spring, it loaned another 166.657 million yuan to 1,448 members to purchase fertilizers, pesticides, and farm tools, ensuring the smooth completion of spring plowing.

	Organize Mutual Support for Agriculture, Sideline Production, and Handicraft Production

	The handicraft and sideline production of farmers in Xialianglian Village are integrated with agricultural production. Farmers mainly engage in agricultural production in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, and engage in handicraft and sideline production in the winter. The credit cooperative, understanding this situation, plans the organization of deposits and loans to enable mutual support between agriculture, handicraft, and sideline production. According to the contradictions of the credit cooperative in spring, where there were few deposits and many loans, which could not meet the requirements of the members, and in autumn, where there were many deposits and few loans, resulting in backlog losses, the credit cooperative actively absorbed deposits of grain and money from the agricultural sector in the autumn and winter seasons to help develop handicraft and sideline production; in the spring, it organized deposits from handicraft and sideline production units to invest in the agricultural sector to support agricultural production. With the help of the credit cooperative, one handicraft cooperative, two coal cooperatives, one iron stove, 11 other small handicrafts, and 12 other workshops were restored and developed. In the past two years, the credit cooperative has helped members in nine villages purchase more than 1,440 pigs and more than 1,700 sheep, opening up a source of fertilizer and increasing the income of members. Last winter, the Xialiang Village Coal Cooperative suffered from excessive snowfall and blocked roads, resulting in a backlog of coal, and nearly a hundred workers were about to suspend operations. The credit cooperative loaned them 10 million yuan, maintaining the normal production of the coal cooperative and ensuring a steady supply of coal for the masses this spring. In this way, it not only met the requirements of the members and ensured the completion of production increase tasks, but also overcame the unevenness in the seasonal operation of funds in the credit cooperative.

    襄垣县下良联村信用合作社介绍
    韩福旺
    从小到大，逐步前进
    下良村是山西襄垣县五区一个四百多户的村庄。它的农业生产以种植谷物为主；手工业生产有旧式铁炉、铁工、木工；副业以养猪为主。为了集中农民的闲散资金，以便扶植农业、手工业和副业生产，一九五○年年底，该村供销合作社内设立了信用部。
    当信用部刚成立时，入股的农民很少。农民们不敢把余粮、余款存放到信用部去。他们怕信用部不讲信用，怕存粮存款被“归公”，怕存款、取款、贷款三不便，怕存粮存款赔钱蚀本。针对这些思想，信用部干部决定实行“从小到大、逐步前进”的办法，用实际事例教育群众。农民李先保经过干部再三动员，入了一股，存了一石粮食，但总是半信半疑；不到几天，信用部就开始贷款扶植农业生产，他很满意，又存了五石小米。农民冯春孩存了一石玉茭，不久，他买回了一头牛，家里生活有困难，信用部就贷给他四石小米，解决了他的困难。他说：“信用部讲信用，我今后有余粮就要存。”信用部有了威信，业务就活跃起来了。一九五一年十月间，信用部改为信用合作社。农民越来越感到信用合作社的好处很多：存储实物有适当利息；就地分散保管，既能整存零取，又能在限定时期内整贷零还；如有特殊困难者，还可适当展期还款；存啥取啥，愿调换其他食粮者还能按公平市价给以折兑。正因为这一切适合农民的要求，存粮、存款的就越来越多了，群众说：“信用社成了‘保险库’”。据一九五二年年底统计，信用社有五百四十五户存有余粮十九万五千余斤，存款二千三百六十六万元，存户与一九五一年相比增加了三倍半。存户占总户数的百分之二十一点五。现在这个信用合作社扩大到周围九个行政村和两个自然村，成为联村信用合作社，共有四千六百五十个社员。
    集中资金，扶植生产
    下良联村信用合作社大力组织农民的闲散资金，对扶植社员生产做出了很大成绩。去年该社将三亿一千一百二十九万元（包括存粮、存款和股金）贷给一千一百五十个社员，并与一百二十九个互助组取得了经常的存贷联系，共帮助社员增购了新式步犁四十五张，各种旧式农具二百六十二件、喷雾器七架、水车九部，打井六眼，开水渠一条，使三百亩土地由旱地变成水地。此外，该社并大量帮助农民购买肥料，社员共购回麻饼一万一千四百三十斤，豆饼二万四千八百九十六斤，羊肥一万七千七百五十担。信用社并帮助二十七家农户解决了生活上的困难，还有十五家农户用贷款新盖和修补了四十八间房子。今年春季又给一千四百四十八个社员贷了一亿六千六百五十七万元购买了肥料、药剂、农具，保证了春耕生产的顺利完成。
    组织农业、副业和手工业生产相互支援
    下良联村农民的手工业和副业生产都是和农业生产相互结合的。农民在春、夏、秋三季主要搞农业生产，冬季则搞手工业与副业生产。信用合作社掌握了当地这个情况，有计划地组织存款和贷款，使农业、手工业、副业生产相互支援。根据春季信用社存少贷多，不能满足社员要求；秋季存多贷少，积压赔利的矛盾，信用社在秋冬两季积极从农业方面吸收存粮、存款，帮助开展手工业和副业生产；到春季从手工业和副业生产单位组织存款，投入农业方面以支援农业生产。在信用社帮助下得到恢复和发展的，计有手工业社一个，煤业社二个，铁炉一座，其他小手工业十一户，还有各种作坊十二座。两年来，信用社帮助九个村的社员购买了猪一千四百四十余口，羊一千七百余只，开辟了肥料来源，增加了社员收入。下良村煤业社去冬因下雪过大，道路阻塞造成煤炭积压，百余工人几乎要歇业。信用合作社给他们贷款一千万元，维持了煤业社的正常生产，保证了今年春季群众用煤得到源源不断的供给。这样，既满足了社员要求，保证了增产任务的完成，也克服了信用合作社在季节经营上资金荣枯不均的现象。
