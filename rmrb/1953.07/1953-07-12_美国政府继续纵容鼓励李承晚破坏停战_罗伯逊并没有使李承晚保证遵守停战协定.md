(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 11) By our special correspondent Jiang Nan: Many messages from Seoul say that the talks between Robertson and Syngman Rhee have ended. Regarding the outcome of the talks, they have agreed to issue a joint statement tomorrow.

The world has ample reason to demand that the result of the Robertson-Syngman Rhee talks should be to have Syngman Rhee strictly guarantee absolute compliance with all the clauses and related agreements of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This is the key to whether the armistice agreement can be signed and whether it can be implemented. However, judging from all the news that has been revealed, Syngman Rhee has not undertaken the obligation to strictly abide by the armistice agreement.

According to a report by United Press reporter Potts from Tokyo today, "South Korea refuses to give the United States a firm guarantee that South Korea will always 'toe the line' after the armistice or during the protracted post-war political conference." This means that even if Syngman Rhee no longer clamors against the armistice agreement, which he calls a "death sentence," he will still sabotage the armistice agreement and the Korean armistice. Since Robertson arrived in Seoul on June 25th, he has held thirteen talks with Syngman Rhee, but he has not done what he could and must do, namely, force Syngman Rhee to guarantee compliance with the armistice agreement. This is the most important result of the Robertson-Rhee talks, and at the same time, the result that has aroused the most public indignation in the world.

Even Robertson and Syngman Rhee themselves do not conceal the lack of strict guarantees regarding the implementation of the armistice agreement in the results of their talks. Robertson told American reporters at the US Embassy in Seoul tonight: "No strict agreement was reached with President Syngman Rhee in the negotiations." Syngman Rhee also said: "I cannot say that the problem has been finally resolved." People can clearly see from this that the Robertson-Rhee talks have not brought hope for an early armistice in Korea, and the US government has not taken effective measures to make Syngman Rhee strictly guarantee compliance with the armistice agreement.

On the contrary, because the US government continues to adopt a policy of indulgence, Syngman Rhee has not only not abandoned his ambition to sabotage the realization of the armistice, but has also obtained more capital from Robertson to continue fighting. A "senior figure" in South Korea told a Reuters reporter tonight that during the talks, Robertson promised Syngman Rhee three things. He said, "The three basic things that Robertson promised are: (1) The United States agrees to guarantee the security of South Korea against aggression with actions rather than words; (2) South Korea retains the right to speak directly at the post-armistice political conference; (3) The United States agrees to continue large-scale economic and military assistance to South Korea." This means that Syngman Rhee can create a pretext of "being invaded" at any time to launch a war, as he did three years ago, and the United States will provide military assistance based on the guarantee. Regarding this military assistance, South Korean officials told Agence France-Presse reporters today that Syngman Rhee had obtained a guarantee of a security treaty from Robertson, "which stipulates that if Korea is attacked, the United States will provide assistance with air and naval forces from bases outside Korea—Okinawa, Japan." According to the second thing Robertson promised, Syngman Rhee can sabotage any agreement reached at the post-armistice political conference that he considers unsatisfactory, so that he can relaunch the war, if he has not had time to sabotage the realization of the armistice before that. As for the so-called large-scale economic and military assistance, it was recently revealed that the United States will give Syngman Rhee at least $80 million and re-equip four more divisions of the Rhee puppet army—another capital for Syngman Rhee to sabotage the armistice.

Judging from these things, people can only draw the conclusion that Syngman Rhee has not guaranteed compliance with the armistice agreement; Robertson has only guaranteed the necessary conditions for Syngman Rhee to sabotage the armistice. That is why Syngman Rhee repeatedly told American reporters today that "Mr. Robertson's sympathetic understanding and our free discussions have made understanding closer." Obviously, it is Robertson who "understands" Syngman Rhee more, and it is Robertson who "stands more closely" with Syngman Rhee. When Robertson spoke to American reporters tonight, he was full of compliments to Syngman Rhee, saying that "he is a true patriot," "he is single-mindedly thinking about the happiness of Korea," and "I personally admire Syngman Rhee extremely." These words are sickening to those who have seen the despicable and shameless actions of this political villain Syngman Rhee in the past month, but they illustrate the fact that the US government is still continuing to connive at and even encourage Syngman Rhee to sabotage the Korean armistice.

Because the Robertson-Rhee talks have such unspeakable inside stories, Robertson has released the air that the joint statement to be issued tomorrow is only a "summary of the general results of the negotiations" and not a "technical document." However, a "senior figure" in South Korea told a Reuters reporter tonight bluntly: "The joint communiqué to be issued tomorrow is drafted as ambiguously as possible in order to prevent the communist side from knowing the details of the agreement."

People here are not interested in how the joint statement of the Robertson-Rhee talks is written. What the Korean and Chinese sides demand is: the US side must come up with clear guarantees regarding the implementation of the armistice agreement; the US side must clearly answer whether the armistice includes Syngman Rhee's government and army, and if it does, what effective measures is the US side prepared to take to strictly guarantee that Syngman Rhee fully complies with all the clauses and related agreements of the armistice agreement. Regardless of the joint statement of the Robertson-Rhee talks, if the US negotiators cannot clearly answer these questions raised by Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai as early as twenty-two days ago, the US side should be fully responsible for the delay in signing the Korean armistice agreement and realizing the Korean armistice.

### 美国政府继续纵容鼓励李承晚破坏停战  罗伯逊并没有使李承晚保证遵守停战协定

    美国政府继续纵容鼓励李承晚破坏停战
    罗伯逊并没有使李承晚保证遵守停战协定
    【新华社开城十一日电】本社特派记者江南报道：从汉城传来的许多消息都说：罗伯逊和李承晚的会谈已告结束。关于会谈的结果，他们约定在明天发表联合声明。
    全世界有充分的理由要求：罗伯逊和李承晚会谈的结果应该是叫李承晚严格保证绝对遵守朝鲜停战协定的所有条款及有关协议。这是停战协定能不能签订以及它能不能实施的关键。但是，从所有已经透露出来的消息看来，李承晚并没有承担严格遵守停战协定的义务。
    据合众社记者波茨今天自东京报道说，“南朝鲜拒绝向美国确切保证：南朝鲜在停战后或拖延的战后政治会议期间将老是‘循规蹈矩’。”这就是说，即使李承晚不再叫嚣反对被他称为“死刑判决书”的停战协定，但李承晚仍然要破坏停战协定，破坏朝鲜停战。罗伯逊自从上月二十五日到达汉城以后，已经和李承晚作了十三次会谈，但他并没有作他能够作而且必须作到的事情，即迫使李承晚保证遵守停战协定。这就是罗李会谈的最重要的同时也是最引起世界舆论公愤的结果。
    甚至连罗伯逊和李承晚自己，也毫不隐瞒他们的会谈结果在实施停战协定方面缺乏严格的保证。罗伯逊今晚在汉城美国大使馆招待美国记者们时说：“并没有和李承晚总统在谈判中达成严格的协议”。李承晚也说：“我不能够说，问题已得到了最后解决。”人们从这里可以清楚地看到，罗李会谈并没有为朝鲜早日停战带来希望，美国政府并没有采取有效的措施使李承晚严格保证遵守停战协定。
    相反地，由于美国政府继续采取纵容的政策，李承晚不但没有放弃他破坏停战实现的野心，而且还从罗伯逊那里得到了继续打下去的更多的资本。南朝鲜的一位“高级人士”今晚告诉路透社记者说，在会谈过程中，罗伯逊答应了李承晚三件事。他说，“罗伯逊答应的三件基本事情是：（一）美国同意用行动而不是用言语保障南朝鲜安全以防侵略；（二）南朝鲜保留在停战后政治会议上有直接发言权；（三）美国答应继续对南朝鲜进行大规模的经济、军事援助。”这就意味着：李承晚可以在任何时制造“被侵略”的藉口来发动战争，像三年前他所做的那样，届时美国就根据保证而给予军事援助。关于这种军事援助，据南朝鲜官员今天告诉法新社记者说，李承晚已从罗伯逊那里得到了安全条约的保证，“这项条约中规定，朝鲜一旦受到攻击时，美国将从朝鲜以外的基地——日本冲绳岛——以空军和海军进行援助”。根据罗伯逊答应的第二件事情，李承晚可以破坏在停战后召开的政治会议作出任何他认为不满意的协议，以便他重新发动战争，如果他在这以前还没有来得及破坏停战实现的话。至于所谓大规模经济、军事援助，不久前就有消息透露，美国将给予李承晚至少八千万美元的款项，并再装备李伪军四个师——这是李承晚破坏停战的又一笔资本。
    从这些事情看来，人们只能得出这样的结论：李承晚并没有保证遵守停战协定，只是罗伯逊保证了李承晚破坏停战的必要条件。这就是为什么李承晚今天对美国记者一再说什么“罗伯逊先生的同情的谅解和我们的自由商谈已使谅解更加密切了”。显然，是罗伯逊更加“谅解”李承晚，是罗伯逊“更加密切”和李承晚站在一起了。罗伯逊今晚向美国记者谈话时对李承晚恭维备至，说“他是一个真正的爱国者”、“他专心为朝鲜幸福着想”、“我个人对李承晚极为钦佩”。这些话对于看到了李承晚这个政治恶棍近一个月来的卑鄙无耻行动的人来说是令人作呕的，但它们倒说明了一个事实，这就是美国政府仍在继续纵容以至鼓励李承晚破坏朝鲜停战。
    正因为罗李会谈有着这样不可告人的内幕，所以罗伯逊已放出空气，说明天发表的联合声明只是“总结一下谈判的一般结果”，不是一个“技术性的文件”。但南朝鲜的一位“高级人士”今晚对路透社记者谈话时直言不讳地说：“明天发表的联合公报草拟得尽可能地含糊其词，为的是避免共方知道协议的详情”。
    此间人士对罗李会谈的联合声明写得怎样并不感到兴趣。朝中方面要求的是：美方必须拿出关于实施停战协定的明确保证来；美方必须明确答复，停战是否包括李承晚的政府和军队在内，如果包括在内，美方准备采取什么有效的措施来严格保证李承晚完全遵守停战协定的所有条款和有关协议。不管罗李会谈的联合声明如何，如果美方谈判代表一天不能明确回答金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员早在二十二天前就提出的这些问题，签订朝鲜停战协定和实现朝鲜停战的拖延，应由美方完全负责。
