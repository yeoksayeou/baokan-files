Millions of letters from home are sent to the Korean front, to the defenders of the motherland and their loved ones. These letters are written by gray-haired parents, young wives, and innocent and lively younger siblings... These letters come from the remote borders of the motherland, from the heart of the motherland, and from the vast Inner Mongolian grasslands of the motherland... All the letters share a common wish: to see their loved ones achieve meritorious service.

"Son, you asked in your letter how much land our family has been allocated and how we are living. Why do you keep asking about these things? Do you think you will have a hard time after you defeat the American devils and come back? Son! Do you know that our county produced a hero, Huang Jiguang? The district, county, and province all held grand meetings to mourn him and said that everyone should learn from his spirit and work hard in production. Nowadays, every household knows his heroic deeds, and everyone praises him! Son, if you don't strive for meritorious service, you will waste the cultivation and education that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have given you, and your father won't like it either..."

This is a passage from a letter that Jiang Kaihua, a rocket launcher squad soldier of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, received from his father. The night he received this letter, this young man tossed and turned, unable to sleep, as a sense of honor that young people crave surged into his heart. He thought: "I came to Korea with Huang Jiguang to join the Volunteer Army! He has already become a famous hero in the country, but I haven't even achieved any merit..." The superiors learned of his feelings and went to talk to him the next day. At this time, Jiang Kaihua was swinging a sledgehammer to excavate a tunnel, sweat streaming down his cheeks. The comrade who went to talk to him asked, "What are you planning to do?" He immediately replied, "To be honest, who among young people doesn't love honor! I often think like this! 'Merit' is like a scale, it's the standard for measuring how much we have done for the country. You say, if you want to weigh me with it, I wouldn't even be enough to be rated a 'merit', doesn't that mean I've spent several years in Korea in a mediocre way? Then how can I be worthy of the people of the motherland, Chairman Mao, and my father!" Finally, he puffed out his chest and said, "Comrade, you just watch!" After saying that, he swung the sledgehammer again, clanging away.

Later, the political instructor of their company told me: "Jiang Kaihua is a good man. In the subsequent battles, he completed the blasting tasks very well, and the company has already applied for merit for him!"

Gao Ming, a soldier of the Second Squad of the First Company of a certain unit, received a letter from his mother from his hometown of Suiyuan. The letter said: "Ming'er, we had a good harvest in our hometown last year. Our family harvested more than sixty dan of grain, enough to eat, enough to wear, and even some left over. The horse that was allocated during the land reform gave birth to a foal this year. Everyone in the family is happy. During the Spring Festival, the villagers all came to our house to celebrate the New Year, bringing gifts of this and that, totaling more than four hundred jin. In those few days, the people coming to our house were more lively than when we took a wife for your brother! Mom often thinks: How could there be such a scene in the old society! Thinking again, isn't it all brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Ming'er, you are outside, you must work hard to kill the enemy and make contributions for the people, repay the hopes of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and defend our happy life."

Gao Ming read his mother's letter over and over, thinking of the life he had with his mother begging for food in his childhood, carefully pondering the good conditions at home that his mother mentioned in the letter, and keeping his mother's instructions in his heart, word by word. In the study of military technology, he studied hard and practiced hard, and learned the blasting and small-group counterattack tactics in three days. When digging tunnels, he swung the sledgehammer quickly and steadily. Sometimes, unable to suppress the words in his heart, he often said to the comrades in the group: "My mother told me to make contributions, I can''t forget my mother's words!"

Once, Comrade Zhang Xun of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army received a letter from his wife from North China, which contained the following enthusiastic passage: "Xun: Let me tell you some good news. Last winter, I was rated as a first-class model worker in the entire district and wore a big red flower. Xun, I hope you will make contributions quickly and send the news of your merit home." This letter gave Zhang Xun great encouragement. He once said to his comrades: "I often think like this: One day, when the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea is victorious, every comrade will have to summarize their work. Some have made special meritorious service, and some have made first-class meritorious service. What about us? If we haven't made any contributions, how can we be worthy of the motherland! The people of the motherland call the Volunteer Army 'the most beloved people,' we have a share in that. The people of the motherland hope that the Volunteer Army will make contributions, can we be an exception?"

Li Liangshu, a soldier of the Seventh Squad of the First Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, has recently been much more efficient in digging tunnels than in the past. He swings the eight-pound hammer at least four hundred times in one breath. It turned out that he had received a letter from his younger sister, Li Liangbi, from Sichuan a few days ago, and the words in the letter always inspired him. "Brother, I have received the letter and money you sent back. Dad said that the family's life is very good, we have enough to eat and wear, we lack nothing, except a certificate of meritorious service!" This fourteen-year-old girl wrote here and added her own wishes:

"Brother, I am determined to study hard and strive to be a model student, and send you the certificate of academic excellence! I also hope that you will strive to be a hero and send the certificate of meritorious service home!" Reading his sister's letter, Li Liangshu only felt a fever on his face and his heart was beating violently. He couldn't help but say to Squad Leader Chen Mingshan: "Squad Leader, you have to help me more. In the past, my work was always neither ahead nor behind, and I didn't make any special contribution to the motherland..." Squad Leader Chen Mingshan already knew his feelings and said to him with a smile: "Let's help each other!" Li Liangshu felt as if the squad leader didn't fully understand his feelings, and said closer to the squad leader: "My sister wrote to me, telling me not to send money back, just hoping that I would send a certificate of meritorious service!" Chen Mingshan smiled and said, "My family's letter also said the same thing. The motherland is rich, and everyone's life is good, no one's family lacks firewood or rice!" The squad leader paused and then said, "To be honest, I have been saving up enough energy to try to send a certificate of meritorious service back home as soon as possible!"

Dear fathers, elders, brothers, sisters of the motherland, please rest assured! Your loved ones are bravely fighting and working diligently day and night, to send thousands of certificates of meritorious service back to the motherland and into your hands!

    千万封家信盼立功
    胡廷宽
    千万封家信，送到朝鲜前线，送到祖国的保卫者和自己的亲人手里。这些信，有白发苍苍的爹娘写的，有年纪轻轻的妻子写的，也有天真活泼的弟妹写的……这些信，有的来自祖国遥远的边疆，有的来自祖国的心脏，还有的来自祖国广阔的内蒙古草原……所有的信都有一个共同愿望：盼望自己的亲人立功。
    “儿呀，你来信问我们家分了多少土地，生活怎么样，你老问这些干啥，难道你打败美国鬼子回来还愁没有好日子过吗？儿呀！你知道吗，我们县出了个英雄黄继光，区里、县里、省里都开大会来追悼他，还说要大家都学习他的精神努力生产呢。如今家家户户都知道他的英雄事迹，谁个不称赞呀！儿呀，你要是不争取立功，就枉费共产党和毛主席对你的培养和教育，作爹的也不喜欢……”。
    这是志愿军某部五连火箭筒班战士蒋开华接到他父亲来信中的一段话。这个年轻小伙子接到这封信的那天晚上，翻来覆去地怎么也睡不着觉，年轻人渴求的荣誉感一股一股地涌上了他的心头。他想：“我和黄继光是一块报名参加志愿军到朝鲜来的！人家已经成了全国有名的英雄，我哩，连个功也没立……”。上级知道了他的心情，第二天就去找他谈话，这时，蒋开华正在抡着铁锤开凿坑道，汗水顺着两颊直往下流。去找他谈话的同志问：“你打算怎么办呀！”他立刻回答说：“说实话，年轻人谁不爱荣誉哩！我常常这样想！‘功’就好比秤一样，是衡量我们为祖国做了多少事的标准，你说，要用它把我秤一下，连个‘功’的格都不够，这不就是说，我在朝鲜平平淡淡地度过了好几年吗？那我怎么样对得起祖国人民、毛主席和我的爹呢！” 最后，他挺起胸膛说：“同志，你瞧着吧！”说罢，他又抡起铁锤叮叮当当地干起来了。
    后来，他们连的指导员告诉我：“蒋开华是个好样的。在以后的几次战斗中，他都很好地完成了爆破任务，连里已经给他请了功！”
    某部一连二班战士高明接到了他母亲从绥远家乡来的信，信上说：“明儿，去年家乡丰收，咱家打了六十多石粮食，有吃的，有穿的，还有余的，土地改革时分得那匹马今年又生了驹。家里大大小小都是欢欢喜喜。春节时，乡亲们都到咱家来贺年，送这送那的，算起来足足有四百多斤。那几天，到咱家来的人翻出翻进，比给你哥哥接媳妇还热闹哩！娘常想：在旧社会那会有这样的光景！再一想，这还不都是共产党和毛主席给咱带来的！明儿，你在外面，要努力杀敌，为人民立功，回答共产党和毛主席对咱的希望，保卫咱们幸福的生活。”
    高明一遍一遍地读着母亲的来信，想起了自己幼年跟娘一块讨饭的生活，仔细揣摸着母亲在来信中谈到的家中目前的好光景，娘的嘱托他一句一句地都记在心上。在军事技术的学习中，他苦学苦练，三天就学会了爆破和小兵群的反击战术动作。在打坑道的时候，他抡铁锤抡得又快又稳，有时，他压不住心头的话，不时地对小组里的同志说：“我娘叫我立功哩，我可不能忘记娘的话！”
    一次，志愿军某部张迅同志接到了他妻子从华北寄来的信，信上写着这样一段热情的话：“迅：给你报个喜吧，去年冬天我被评为全专区的一等工作模范，还戴了大红花哩。迅，我盼望你赶快立功，把立功喜报寄回家来。”这封信给张迅很大的鼓励。他曾对同志们说：“我也常这样想：有一天，抗美援朝胜利了，每个同志都要总结一下自己的工作。人家有的立了特等功，有的立了一等功，咱哩，啥功也没立，怎对得起祖国呢！祖国人民称志愿军为‘最可爱的人’咱有份，祖国人盼望志愿军立功，那咱还能例外吗？”
    志愿军某部一连七班战士李良树，最近打坑道比过去的效率高得多了，八磅重的大锤他一气至少抡四百下，原来前几天他接到了妹妹李良碧从四川的来信，信里的话时时激励着他。“哥哥，你寄回来的信和钱都收到了。爹说，家里生活很好，有吃有穿，啥都不缺，就缺一张立功喜报！”这个才十四岁的小姑娘写到这里，又加上了自己的愿望说：
    “哥哥，我决心好好学习，争取当学习模范，把学习优良奖状寄给你！也希望你争取当英雄，把立功喜报寄回家来！”李良树读着妹妹的来信，脸上只觉得一阵发烧，心里也在激烈地跳动着。他禁不住对班长陈明山说：“班长，你要多帮助我，从前我的工作老是不在前不在后的，对祖国也没有特别的贡献……”班长陈明山早知道了他的心情，带着笑对他说：“咱们相互帮助吧！”李良树觉得好像班长不完全了解他的心情似的，更凑近班长说：“我妹妹来信，叫我不必寄钱回去，就盼我寄张立功喜报呀！”陈明山笑了笑，说：“我家里的来信也是这样说呀，祖国富足了，大家的生活都好了，谁家还缺柴少米哩！”班长顿了一下，接着说：“说老实话，我早就攒足了劲儿，争取早点给家中寄回一张立功喜报去！”
    亲爱的祖国父老兄弟姊妹们，请放心吧！你们的亲人正在日日夜夜地勇敢地战斗、奋发地工作，要把千万张立功喜报寄回祖国，送到你们的手里！（附图片）
