    The Transformation of a Supply and Marketing Cooperative Storefront
    Zhang Ruiyun, Mu Lin, Sun Xihong
    The Black Goat Mountain Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative storefront in the Second District of Yexian County, Shandong Province, was opened in October last year. In the past, due to the cooperative cadres' unclear concept of serving production and serving the members, the relationship between the cooperative and the masses of members was very distant, and the business situation was very poor. Later, the superior cooperative sent Comrade Cui Zhicheng to work at this storefront. Soon after Comrade Cui arrived at the cooperative, he saw an old man named Qu come to the storefront to buy thread. After asking the price, he turned and left, muttering, "Who wants your goods for the same money! You even need a membership card to buy things." After a while, another person came to buy matches and also left after asking the price. Cui Zhicheng realized that the relationship between the storefront and the masses of members was not good, but he was not clear about the key issue. So, he went to talk with some older people to solicit their opinions on the cooperative and understand the masses' demands on the cooperative. People told him: the people at the cooperative storefront don't get up early, don't open in the morning, and close as soon as it gets dark; they have a bad attitude towards customers, and members don't want to see their fierce looks when they spend the same amount of money. Many residents in the township burn lime, and few people are at home except during mealtimes; therefore, the masses of members want to buy things during mealtimes, but the cooperative storefront is closed. Once, a member's family had a patient who needed to buy half a catty of brown sugar, but he knocked on the cooperative storefront for more than an hour and couldn't get it open. Later, they said it was past the time and wouldn't sell it. An old woman came to the cooperative in the evening with a lamp to buy kerosene, but couldn't get the door open either. The masses of members were extremely dissatisfied with these things.
    Comrade Cui Zhicheng collected these opinions and convened a meeting of the cooperative's cadres, starting with an examination of the operating situation to study the root causes of being detached from the masses. But the accountant, Han Chengan, said, "The operating situation is not good because the purchasing power of the local masses is low." Comrade Cui immediately used examples of local production increases to show that the masses were already relatively affluent economically. At the same time, he cited specific examples reflected by the masses to show that the poor operating situation was mainly due to the cooperative being detached from the masses; then, he conducted education on serving production and serving the members. After discussion, everyone decided to change the operating style and system that were unsuitable for rural habits, such as "waiting for customers to come" and "no service after hours."
    After the meeting, Comrade Du of the cooperative took the lead in responding to the call of the cooperative's cadre meeting with practical actions: his attitude towards customers became amiable, he actively introduced goods to the members when there were goods, and patiently explained to the members when there were no goods. When the storefront needed goods, they had to go to the Shahe cooperative to pick them up, and Comrade Du pushed them back himself in a small cart. Comrade Cui also personally pushed the cart to transport goods. Accountant Han also had a great change. In the past, when he went to the Shahe cooperative to deposit funds, he was unwilling to bring back any goods for his comrades, saying, "I have to rush back, I'm afraid of messing up the accounts." Now he says, "I will push a cart to bring back goods when I go to Shahe again." Now the unity among the storefront cadres has been strengthened. In the past, they shirked responsibility for cooking, and if no one cooked, they bought ready-made food to eat. Now they are vying to cook. They take turns on duty during meals to take care of the storefront in order to meet the members' demands for buying goods during meals. In this way, the sales volume of the cooperative storefront gradually increased. The sales volume in February was 11.24 million yuan, which increased to 25 million yuan in March, and increased to 46 million yuan in April, an increase of more than three times compared with February. Everyone further realized that establishing the concept of serving the members, and changing the operating style of being detached from the masses, were the decisive factors for the significant increase in sales volume.
    In spring, spring plowing and production became the overriding central task in the countryside. Cui Zhicheng considered how the cooperative could do a good job in supplying goods and serving spring plowing production, and actively contacted the loan officer of the People's Bank and discussed with the township cadres how to help the farmers achieve timely sowing and ensure a good wheat harvest. One day, Qiu Zhanguo, a farmer in the township, bought seventy catties of chemical fertilizer. Comrade Cui Zhicheng thought: the farmers here are not used to using chemical fertilizer, why did he buy seventy catties all at once? He must have experience. Cui Zhicheng personally went to Qiu Zhanguo and asked him about his experience in using chemical fertilizer and the situation of high yield. But Qiu Zhanguo was afraid of "revealing his wealth" and was unwilling to speak boldly, only saying that he had worked in the city north in the past and knew how to use chemical fertilizer, but he was not sure he could use it well; he said that last year his corn only yielded more than four hundred catties per mu. Comrade Cui went to Qiu Zhanguo's neighbors to inquire about Qiu Zhanguo's production situation. They reflected that Qiu Zhanguo's corn must have yielded six or seven hundred catties per mu, and confirmed that Qiu Zhanguo was very good at using chemical fertilizer. After Cui learned the details, he talked to Qiu Zhanguo again, explaining that high yield was glorious, explaining the people's government's production policy, and asking him to introduce his experience in using chemical fertilizer to obtain high yield, so that everyone could grow more grain. Only then did Qiu Zhanguo reveal his experience in using chemical fertilizer and the fact that his corn yielded more than seven hundred catties per mu last year. Cui Zhicheng also discussed with the township cadres to use Qiu Zhanguo as a typical example to introduce his experience in using chemical fertilizer to the masses of farmers. The masses were in high spirits, and many people were willing to buy chemical fertilizer. A total of more than 5,700 catties were sold in the township. Some members said: last year, people were forced to buy it and they didn't buy it. This year the cooperative has changed. People who didn't buy it last year want to buy it this year.
    In order to ensure a good wheat harvest, irrigation must be carried out. Comrade Cui went deep into the fields to check the waterwheels, and found that many waterwheels were missing parts such as screws and leather coins, and some waterwheels needed to be repaired. Comrade Cui contacted the county federation of cooperatives and asked them to send people to go deep into the fields to check and assist the farmers in repairing the waterwheels, and to replenish the parts for the farmers. In the past, some farmers hung the waterwheel chains backwards, which was inconvenient to use, so they scolded the cooperative. Now the people of the cooperative repaired Li Shuhong's waterwheel chain, and he said with emotion, "Are you thirsty? I'll boil water for you to drink." Li Shuhong said that his waterwheel was missing an oil can, and Comrade Cui went to Shahe to bring back the oil can and sell it to him, explaining that it was 3,400 yuan each. Li said, "It's too cheap, I have to use it even if it's more expensive. I feel really sorry to have you run more than ten miles." The cooperative cadres went deep into the farmers' households and fields, repaired the waterwheels, and supplied the parts. The masses were very satisfied. In the past, the storefront had many waterwheel parts, but the masses felt they were too expensive and didn't want them. Now they feel they are "too cheap."
    The Qu Mingguo mutual aid team didn't have money to buy a waterwheel. Cui Zhicheng persuaded them to adopt the method of small savings and large withdrawals, plus a loan, to buy a waterwheel. The team members were very happy after watering the wheat, saying, "With a waterwheel and a well, a good wheat harvest is guaranteed." The cooperative sold four waterwheels.
    The farmers in this area burn lime and need coal. In the past, the cooperative storefront didn't care about this at all. Cui Zhicheng went deep into the construction site to understand the masses' demands, and immediately guaranteed the supply of coal. On March 16th, the local people went to the "Temple Fair," and the masses were accustomed to eating good food. Some of the masses reflected, "It would be great if the cooperative could get some wine!" Comrade Cui immediately sent someone to transport eighty catties of wine back to sell. The masses also said, "I heard that there is rice in Shahe, we should also get some to eat." But there were too few people in the storefront, and it was also market day, so they couldn't take care of it. A member said, "You write a note, I'll deliver lime and bring back a cart of rice." Comrade Cui said that he could pay the freight. The member said, "If I hire a porter, I won't push it for you. This rice is for our own use." But one cart of rice was still not enough. Comrade Du of the cooperative pushed another cart to fully meet the needs of the masses. The relationship between the masses and the cooperative became closer. People praised, "Whatever we need, the cooperative will find a way to supply it. The cooperative is really serving us."
    The cooperative storefront has undergone a great transformation in its work this spring and is very popular with the masses, but Comrade Cui Zhicheng is not complacent at all. He often checks his own shortcomings in the cooperative and encourages everyone to work hard to learn from the masses and earnestly serve production and serve the members.

    一个供销合作社门市部的转变
    张瑞云  木林  孙锡鸿
    山东省掖南县二区院上乡黑羊山村供销合作社门市部是去年十月开设的，过去由于合作社干部为生产服务、为社员服务的观念不明确，合作社和社员群众的关系非常疏远，营业情况很不好。后来，上级社派了崔志诚同志到这个门市部去工作。崔同志刚到该社不久，有一次，看见一个姓曲的老头到门市部来买线，问明价钱转身就走了，并且嘟噜着说：“一样的钱谁要你们的货！买东西还得拿着个社员证。”不一会又一个人来买火柴，也是问问价钱就走了。崔志诚意识到门市部和社员群众的关系不好，但还弄不清楚关键究竟在那里。于是他就去找一些老年人谈天，征求他们对合作社的意见，了解群众对合作社的要求。人们告诉他：合作社门市部的人早晨不起来，上午不开门，天不黑就关门；对顾客态度不好，社员买东西，花一样的钱，谁愿看他们那个凶样子？该乡居民烧石灰的很多，除了吃饭的时间，很少有人在家；因此，社员群众在吃饭时间要买东西，但合作社门市部却不开门。有一次一个社员家中有病人，要买半斤红糖用，但他到合作社门市部叫了一个多钟头也叫不开门，后来才说是过了时间不卖了。有一个老大娘傍晚拿着灯到合作社买火油，也叫不开门。社员群众对这些事极为不满。
    崔志诚同志搜集了这些意见，就召开社的干部会议，从检查经营情况入手，研究脱离群众的根源。但会计韩成安说：“经营情况不好，这是当地群众的购买力低。”崔同志即以当地增产实例说明群众经济上已比较充裕，同时举出群众反映的具体事例，说明经营情况不好，主要是合作社脱离群众；随即进行了要为生产服务和为社员服务的教育。大家讨论之后，决定改变“等客上门”和“过时不候”等不适合农村习惯的经营作风和制度。
    开过会后，该社杜同志首先以实际行动响应了社的干部会的号召：对待顾客的态度和蔼了，有货积极向社员介绍，无货时向社员耐心解释。门市部用货要到沙河社去取，杜同志自己用小车推回来。崔同志也亲自推车运货。韩会计也有了很大的变化，过去他到沙河社解款，同志们让他捎点货他都不愿意，并说：“我得赶急回来，怕弄乱账”。现在他说：“我再去沙河也推小车捎货。”现在门市部干部间的团结加强了。过去做饭互相推诿，没有人作饭就买现成东西吃，现在是争先恐后地作饭了。吃饭时轮流值班照顾门市，以适应社员在吃饭时买货的要求。这样，合作社门市部的销货额逐渐增加了。二月份的销货额是一千一百二十四万元，三月份增至二千五百万元，四月份增至四千六百万元，比二月份增加三倍以上。大家更进一步认识到树立为社员服务的观点，转变脱离群众的经营作风，是销货额显著增加的决定因素。
    春天，春耕生产成为农村中压倒一切的中心工作。崔志诚就考虑合作社如何作好供应工作、为春耕生产服务的问题，并主动和人民银行贷款员联系，找乡干部研究如何帮助农民群众作到适时播种，保证小麦丰收。有一天，该乡农民邱占国买了七十斤化学肥料。崔志诚同志想：这里农民用化学肥料很不习惯，为什么他一下就买了七十斤呢？他一定有经验。崔志诚亲自去找邱占国，问他用化学肥料的经验和丰产情况。但邱占国怕“露富”，不肯大胆说，只说过去在城北扛过活，会使用化学肥料，但不一定能用好；他说，去年他的苞米，每亩地只打了四百多斤。崔同志又去向邱占国的地邻询问邱占国的生产情况，他们反映：邱占国的苞米肯定是每亩收了六、七百斤，并证实邱占国用化学肥料很擅长。崔同志摸清底细后，又找邱占国谈，说明丰产是光荣的，说明人民政府的生产政策，请他把使用化学肥料得到丰产的经验介绍出来，让大家都多打些粮食。邱占国这时才说出他使用化学肥料的经验和去年苞米每亩收了七百余斤的事实。崔志诚又找乡干部研究，以邱占国作典型，向农民群众介绍了他使用化学肥料的经验。群众情绪很高，许多人都愿意买化学肥料。全乡共销售了五千七百余斤。有的社员说：去年强迫人买人家都不买，今年合作社变样了，去年不买的人今年也要买了。
    为了保证小麦丰收，必须进行灌溉。崔同志深入田间，查看水车的情形，发现许多水车缺螺丝、皮钱等零件，有的水车还需要修理。崔同志到县联社去联系，请他们派人深入田间检查，协助农民修理水车，并替农民补充零件。过去，有些农民把水车链子挂反了，使用起来不方便，就骂合作社。现在合作社的人把李叔洪的水车链子修理好了，他感动地说：“您渴，我烧水给您喝。”李叔洪说他的水车缺个油壶，崔同志就到沙河拿回油壶卖给他，说明三千四百元一个，李说：“太贱了，再多点也得用，叫您跑十几里路，俺真过意不去。”合作社干部这样深入农户、田间，修理好了水车，供应了零件，群众很满意。过去门市部有很多水车零件，群众嫌贵而不要，现在则感到“太贱了”。
    曲明国互助组没有钱买水车，崔志诚说服他们采取零储整支的办法，再加上贷款，买了一部水车。该组组员浇了小麦后很高兴，说：“有了水车和井，小麦丰收有保证了。”合作社销了四部水车。
    该地农民烧石灰，需要煤炭。过去合作社门市部根本不关心这件事。崔志诚深入工地了解到群众这个要求，立即保证了煤炭的供应。当地三月十六日赶“庙会”，群众习惯要吃点好饭，有的群众反映：“社里搞点酒多好！”崔同志即派人运了八十斤酒回来卖。群众又说：“听说沙河有大米，咱们也该弄点吃吃。”但门市部人员太少，又逢集期，照顾不暇。有一个社员说：“您开条，我去送石灰，捎回一车大米来。”崔同志说可付给运费，这个社员说：“如果雇脚我就不给您推了，这大米是我们自己用啊。”但一车大米仍不敷用，该社杜同志又去推了一车，充分满足了群众的需要。群众和合作社的关系更密切了。人们赞扬道：“咱要什么，合作社就想法供给什么，合作社真是为咱服务了。”
    合作社门市部在今春工作中有很大转变，很受群众欢迎，但崔志诚同志丝毫不自满，在社内经常检查自己工作不足之处，勉励大家努力向群众学习，切实为生产服务，为社员服务。
