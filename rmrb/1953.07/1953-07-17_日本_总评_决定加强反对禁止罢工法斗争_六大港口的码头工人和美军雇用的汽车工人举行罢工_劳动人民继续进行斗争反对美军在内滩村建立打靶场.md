Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: Tokyo dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sōhyō) has decided to strengthen the struggle against the anti-strike law.

    Sōhyō held a tactical committee on the 14th to discuss the third practical action against the anti-strike law. The meeting decided that all 37 unions affiliated with Sōhyō would prepare to take practical actions, including strikes, at any time after the 25th to resolutely protest the recently passed anti-strike law in the House of Representatives. The Sōhyō Secretariat will hold a meeting on the 21st to specifically determine the date and content of this large-scale protest movement.

    The meeting on the 14th also decided that Sōhyō would support and participate in the demonstration scheduled to be held in Tokyo around July 20th by the residents of Uchihama Village in Ishikawa Prefecture against the U.S. military’s occupation of Uchihama Village as a firing range.

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: Tokyo dispatch: Dockworkers in six major ports in Japan, including Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Nagoya, Moji, and Shimonoseki, simultaneously launched their first 24-hour strike on the 15th, demanding thorough guarantees of dockworkers' legal rights and wage increases.

    The All-Japan Harbor Workers' Union, composed of more than 20,000 dockworkers, is scheduled to convene a central struggle committee on the 20th to make decisions regarding the second and third strikes.

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: Tokyo dispatch: More than 1,700 auto drivers and repairmen employed by the U.S. military, belonging to the Tokyo Transportation Branch of the All-Japan Garrison Forces Union, began a 48-hour strike at 6:00 a.m. on the 16th, demanding that the U.S. military authorities dismiss two Japanese gang leaders who act as henchmen for the U.S. military. This is their unprecedented first strike. Striking workers set up picket lines in front of five U.S. military auto repair stations, waving union flags and chanting "Dismiss the gangster bosses!"

    Kyodo News reported: "The U.S. military hastily summoned American soldiers to temporarily drive buses and trucks. But only half the usual number of vehicles were running."

Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: TASS dispatch: Japanese newspapers and radio stations report that the Japanese working people are continuing their struggle against the U.S. military establishing a firing range in Uchihama Village.

    According to Osaka Radio, the Hokuriku Private Railway Workers' Union, located in Uchihama Village, began a 96-hour protest strike on the 11th, refusing to transport U.S. military supplies to the firing range.

    In order to disrupt the railway workers' struggle, the Japanese government ordered "Nippon Express" to use heavy trucks to transport shells to the firing range. On the 13th, the executive committee of the Hokuriku Private Railway Workers' Union held an emergency meeting. At the meeting, a delegation was selected to protest to the authorities of "Nippon Express." The union chairman, Okamoto, visited the union leadership of "Nippon Express," proposing the conclusion of an agreement on unified action to ensure that they would not participate in transporting U.S. military supplies to the Uchihama firing range in the future.

    The Nippon Express union leadership expressed its full support for the railway workers' struggle against the U.S. military's establishment of a firing range in Uchihama Village.

    “总评”在十四日举行了战术委员会，讨论第三次以实际行动反对禁止罢工法的问题。会议决定，“总评”属下的三十七个工会，全部准备在二十五日以后随时采取包括罢工在内的实际行动，坚决抗议最近众议院通过的禁止罢工法。“总评”干事会将在二十一日举行会议，具体规定这次大规模抗议运动的日期和内容。
    十四日的会议并决定，“总评”将支持和参加石川县内滩村居民订于七月二十日左右在东京举行的反对美军占用内滩村为打靶场的示威游行。
    【新华社十六日讯】    东京消息：日本东京、大阪、神户、名古屋、门司、下关等六大港口的码头工人，在十五日一齐举行第一次二十四小时罢工，要求彻底保证码头工人的法定权益，并要求增加工资。
    由两万多名码头工人组成的全日本港湾工会订于二十日召开中央斗争委员会，将作出有关第二次和第三次罢工的决定。
    【新华社十六日讯】    东京消息：属于全日本驻军工会东京输送部分会的美国驻军雇用的汽车司机和修配人员一千七百余人，自十六日上午六时起举行四十八小时罢工，要求美军当局开除两个充当美军爪牙的日本籍把头。这是他们空前第一次的罢工。罢工工人打着工会旗帜在五个美军汽车修配站门前布置了纠察线，高呼“开除坏蛋把头！”
    共同社报道：“美军方面慌忙召集美国兵，临时驾驶公共汽车和卡车。但只有平常的一半车辆在开驶。”
    【新华社十六日讯】    塔斯社讯：日本报纸和电台报道：日本劳动人民继续进行斗争，反对美军在内滩村建立打靶场。
    据大阪电台广播，内滩村所在地北陆私营铁道工会，自十一日起开始了九十六小时抗议罢工，拒绝装运美国军用品到打靶场。

    通运公司工会领导机构表示完全支持铁路员工反对美军在内滩村建立打靶场的斗争。
