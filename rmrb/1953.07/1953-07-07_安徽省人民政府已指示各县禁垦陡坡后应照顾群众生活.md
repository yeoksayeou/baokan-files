    Anhui Provincial People's Government Instructs Counties to Take Care of People's Livelihoods After Banning Cultivation of Steep Slopes

    Letter from the General Office of the Anhui Provincial People's Government: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on May 22 published two letters from readers Hua Liangmin and others, reflecting that Huoshan, Lu'an and other places in Anhui did not solve the problem of people's livelihoods when carrying out soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas, resulting in livelihood difficulties and arousing public dissatisfaction. The Provincial People's Government's spring plowing production inspection team also discovered similar situations during inspection work. The Provincial People's Government immediately formulated temporary remedial measures regarding the issue of the masses opening up mountains for production, and notified all localities to implement them on May 25. The measures are as follows:

    (1) Farmers should be allowed to plant crops on slopes with gradients of 25 degrees or more that have already been cultivated; those that have already been planted must not be forced to remove seedlings or prevent weeding; however, local governments should educate and help the masses gradually build terraces.

    (2) Banning the cultivation of slopes with gradients of 25 degrees or more is certainly in the long-term interests of farmers; however, at present, some farmers rely on opening up mountains to maintain their livelihoods due to a lack of land. If cultivation on slopes with gradients of 25 degrees or more is completely prohibited, it will seriously affect their livelihoods. Therefore, it cannot be dealt with simply and enforced forcibly. It is necessary to start by solving the difficulties they face as a result of not being able to open up mountains. The relevant county people's governments must conduct in-depth investigations and research, draft a long-term plan to solve this problem, and report to the Provincial People's Government for approval and implementation. For those who cannot live due to the prohibition of cultivating slopes with gradients of 25 degrees or more, the government must support them in overcoming difficulties, such as intensive farming and increasing yields on existing land, or developing sideline occupations and animal husbandry. Those who cannot overcome current difficulties without cultivating a portion of the slopes should be allowed to cultivate a portion in a planned manner after being approved by the people's representatives conference at the township level and the approval of the county people's government; at the same time, efforts should be made to support them in building terraces and cultivating economic forests to conserve water and soil and reduce disasters.

    (3) The people's governments of mountainous counties should immediately conduct an inspection of the implementation of closing mountains for afforestation, soil and water conservation, and banning the cultivation of mountain slopes with gradients of 25 degrees or more.

### 安徽省人民政府已指示各县禁垦陡坡后应照顾群众生活

    安徽省人民政府已指示各县禁垦陡坡后应照顾群众生活
    安徽省人民政府办公厅来信：五月二十二日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了读者华亮民等的两封来信，反映安徽霍山、六安等地在进行山区水土保持工作时没有设法解决群众生活问题，以致造成群众生活困难，引起群众不满。我省人民政府春耕生产检查组在检查工作时，亦发现类似情况。省人民政府即制定了关于群众开山生产问题临时补救办法，并于五月二十五日通知各地执行。其办法如下：
    （一）已经开垦的二十五度以上的坡地应准许农民种植农作物，已经种上的不得强迫拔除青苗或阻止耘草；但当地政府应教育和帮助群众逐步修成梯田。
    （二）禁止二十五度以上的坡地开垦，固然合乎农民的长远利益；但目前有一部分农民因土地缺乏，依赖开山维持生活，如一律禁止在二十五度以上的坡地开垦，就严重影响他们的生活。因此，不能简单从事，强迫执行，必须从解决他们因不开山而产生的困难着手。有关各县人民政府必须深入调查研究，拟出长期解决这个问题的计划，报告省人民政府批准执行。对目前因禁止在二十五度以上坡地开垦而无法生活者，必须由政府支持他们克服困难，如在原有土地上精耕细作、提高产量或发展副业及牧畜业等。对非开垦一部分坡地就无法克服当前困难者，应经乡各界人民代表会议通过，经县人民政府批准，允许有计划地开垦一部分；与此同时，即应设法支持他们修梯田、培养经济林，以保持水土，减少灾害。
    （三）山区各县人民政府应即将封山育林、水土保持、禁止在二十五度以上山坡开垦工作执行情况，作一次检查。
