Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd. News: Under the dual attack of intensified capitalist market competition and reduced purchasing power of the domestic population, the Japanese textile industry is suffering increasingly heavy blows.

    According to a survey report by the Tokyo Credit Exchange, a research institution composed of some Japanese textile companies, about 200 Japanese textile companies declared bankruptcy in the half-year from January to June this year. The survey report stated: There were 99 bankrupt companies with debts of 10 million yen or more, seven more than the number of bankrupt companies with debts of 10 million yen or more in the same period last year. The total debt of these 99 companies reached 5,851,100,000 yen, while the total debt of bankrupt companies with debts of 10 million yen or more in the same period last year was 5.2 billion yen.

    The survey report listed the reasons for the collapse of the Japanese textile industry as "high raw material prices," "low selling prices," and "sluggish domestic trade." After the war, Japan's textile industry has been used by the United States as a processing industry for American cotton. The United States forces Japan to import millions of bales of expensive cotton every year, and this year it plans to increase the import volume of American cotton to 1.34 million bales. In order to compete in the international market, Japanese textile merchants, while intensifying the exploitation of textile workers, have no choice but to sell products made from expensive raw materials at low prices. Despite this, due to strong resistance from Britain against Japanese textiles, the export volume of Japanese textiles, especially since last year, has dropped sharply. In the second half of last year, Japan's cotton cloth exports plummeted by 44 percent. From January to April this year, Japan's cotton textile exports decreased by nearly 22 percent compared with the same period last year. This situation has caused serious panic in the Japanese textile industry, which relies on exports. At the same time, as the foreign market shrinks, the competition for the shrinking domestic market has also intensified. Under these circumstances, the small and medium-sized textile industries with weak capital were the first to be squeezed out. The Tokyo Credit Exchange survey report pointed out: Almost half of the approximately 200 textile companies that went bankrupt in the first half of this year were small companies with capital of less than one million yen. Kyodo News Agency said: "This shows that companies with less capital are most vulnerable to economic reversals." "The vast majority of bankrupt companies are companies that have emerged after the war."

    日本二百家中小纺织业公司在上半年倒闭
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息：在资本主义市场竞争加剧和国内人民购买力降低的双重夹击下，日本纺织业受到的打击正越来越沉重。
    根据由日本一些纺织公司组成的研究机关东京信用交易所的调查报告，在从今年一月到六月的半年中，约有两百家日本纺织业公司宣告破产。调查报告说：破产的公司负债在一千万日元以上者共有九十九家，比去年同一时期负债一千万日元以上的破产公司多七家。这九十九家公司负债总数达五十八亿五千一百万日元，去年同一时期负债一千万日元以上的破产公司负债总额为五十二亿日元。
    调查报告列举日本纺织业倒闭的原因是：“原料的价格昂贵”、“卖价低廉”和“国内贸易的迟滞”。战后日本的纺织工业一直被美国作为美国棉花的加工工业。美国每年都要强迫日本输入上百万包价格昂贵的棉花，今年还准备将美棉输入量增加到一百三十四万包。为了在国际市场进行竞争，日本纺织商在加紧压榨纺织工人的同时，又不能不把用价格昂贵的原料制成的产品以低价卖出。尽管这样，由于英国对日本纺织品的强烈抵制，日本纺织品的输出数额，特别是从去年以来，猛烈下降。去年下半年，日本棉布的出口骤减了百分之四十四。今年一月到四月，日本棉织品的出口又比去年同期减少了将近百分之二十二。这种情况造成了依赖输出的日本纺织业的严重恐慌。同时，由于国外市场缩小，对于萎缩的国内市场的争夺，也更加剧烈起来。在这种境遇之下，首先挤垮了资本薄弱的中小纺织业。东京信用交易所的调查报告指出：今年上半年破产的约二百家纺织公司几乎有一半是资本不到一百万日元的小公司。共同社说：“这说明了资本少的公司在经济的逆转中最容易受到打击。”“绝大部分破产的公司都是战后兴起的公司”。
