Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th. The New York "Worker's Daily" published an editorial on the 2nd saying: "It is a terrible thing that soldiers are dying every day in Korea because Eisenhower and General Clark are condoning the bellicose puppet Syngman Rhee. Syngman Rhee clamors that he will never accept an armistice unless Washington guarantees him a new war within three months. And President Eisenhower is telling American parents not to be impatient with the delay in achieving a Korean armistice." The editorial said that Eisenhower's way of "comforting the angry people who have been waiting for a Korean armistice shows that the American people's hatred of the war criminal Syngman Rhee is growing. But it also means that all Americans should demand that Eisenhower refuse to lose another life for Syngman Rhee's sake!"

The newspaper concluded: "Washington should fulfill the agreement it signed on the issue of prisoners of war! Washington should stop giving any kind of aid to the aggressor Syngman Rhee!"

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th. The U.S. "People's World" demanded in its July 1st editorial that the U.S. government stop indulging Syngman Rhee. The editorial said, "Either conclude a peace treaty with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, or conclude a war treaty with the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. These are the two paths facing the American people on the Korean issue.

General Clark apparently wants to achieve both goals at the same time, which is either a deception or futile. Syngman Rhee does not want peace because his corrupt dictatorship cannot survive in a peaceful situation for long. His so-called 'compromise' proposal is a time bomb designed to sabotage the armistice, and this bomb is sure to explode in ninety days.

He demanded that the time limit for the political conference after the ceasefire be limited to ninety days. He is convinced that his pawns in South Korea and his powerful friends in Washington can obstruct any political settlement in such a short period of time. Secondly, he demanded a military alliance treaty with the United States to ensure that American manpower, materials, and financial resources would be poured into a renewed bloody war at the end of the ninety days.

On the other hand, the Korean and Chinese side is asking for peace, and they have demonstrated their desire by facilitating the resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue.

What do the American people want? They also want peace. The American people generally welcomed the resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue and the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war with great joy, which shows their desire.

Stop secretly indulging Syngman Rhee! Stop engaging in behind-the-scenes conspiracies with Syngman Rhee! Immediately sign an armistice agreement that guarantees compliance!"

### 美国“工人日报”和“人民世界报”发表社论  要求美国政府停止对李承晚的纵容

    美国“工人日报”和“人民世界报”发表社论
    要求美国政府停止对李承晚的纵容
    【新华社柏林五日电】纽约“工人日报”二日发表社论说：“士兵们因为艾森豪威尔与克拉克将军姑息好战的傀儡李承晚而每天在朝鲜死亡，这简直是暴行。李承晚叫嚣说：他决不接受停战，除非华盛顿向他保证三个月内重新发动战争。而艾森豪威尔总统却正在叫美国的父母们不要因为朝鲜停战迟迟不能实现而不耐烦。”社论说：艾森豪威尔这样
    “来安慰一直在等待朝鲜停战的愤怒的人民，说明美国人民憎恨战犯李承晚的情绪正在日益增涨。但是，这也意味着全体美国人民应该要求艾森豪威尔拒绝为了李承晚的缘故再损失一条人命！”
    报纸最后说道：“华盛顿应该履行它所签订的关于战俘问题的协议！华盛顿应该停止给侵略者李承晚任何种类的援助！”
    【新华社柏林五日电】美国“人民世界报”在七月一日的社论中要求美国政府停止纵容李承晚。社论说，“要就和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军签订和平条约，要就和李承晚傀儡政权签订战争条约。这就是在朝鲜问题上摆在美国人民面前的两条道路。
    克拉克将军显然想同时达到这两个目的，这不是骗局，也是徒劳无功的。李承晚不要和平，因为他的腐朽的独裁统治不能长期在和平局面下存在下去。他的所谓‘折衷’建议是阴谋破坏停战的定时炸弹，这颗炸弹在九十天后就一定要爆炸。
    他要求把停火后的政治会议的时间限制为九十天，他深信他在南朝鲜的爪牙和他在华盛顿的有势力的朋友，能够在这样一段短短的时间内阻挠任何政治解决。其次他要求和美国签订一项军事同盟条约，保证在九十天终了时，美国的人力、物资和财力又会投入重起的流血战争。
    在另一方面，朝中方面是要求和平的，他们已经用促成战俘问题的解决来表明他们的愿望。
    美国人民要求的是什么？他们要求的也是和平。美国人民普遍兴高采烈地欢迎战俘问题的解决和病伤战俘的交换，这表明了他们的愿望。
    停止秘密纵容李承晚！停止和李承晚进行幕后阴谋！立即签订保证遵守的停战协定！”
