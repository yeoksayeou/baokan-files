The Chinese edition, Issue 28, 1953, of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Negotiation - The Path to Peaceful Resolution of International Issues." The editorial points out that the World Peace Council's declaration to launch a global movement for negotiation and other resolutions passed at the Budapest meeting in June are documents with tremendous mobilizing and organizing power. These resolutions were made based on the demands and desires of millions of people with different views and professions. They have been warmly received and unanimously supported by people of all countries. People of all countries will express their demands for a peaceful settlement of all disputes in various organizational forms. However, there are many difficulties on the road to resolving the issues that complicate the international situation. In the United States and other capitalist countries, there are small but influential groups who openly oppose negotiation, or verbally express their willingness to negotiate, but in reality continue to implement their "policy of force," "cold war," and arms expansion policies. Therefore, it is necessary to be vigilant, that is, to be good at foreseeing the conspiracies and tricks of the aggressive groups in the imperialist camp, and to be good at ruthlessly exposing and isolating them in front of the masses of the people. The editorial then says: The Communist and Workers' Parties, which are closely connected with the broad masses, recognize that the guarantee of success in the struggle to maintain peace lies first and foremost in strengthening and expanding the unity of the working class and the unity of all working people. In launching a comprehensive world movement for peace through negotiation, the struggle of the people of all countries for peace will gain new strength. The organization of this movement is becoming more and more perfect, its mass base is expanding day by day, and therein lies the guarantee that the forces of peace will force the forces of war to retreat.

Important articles in this issue include: "The Struggle for Peace, Democracy, and People's Welfare After the Italian Parliamentary Elections" by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party; "Trends in the British Labor Movement" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party; and "For the National Democratic Front of the Algerian People" by Ahmed Akache, Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party.

Togliatti's article is an abstract of his report at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party on July 2. His report analyzed the political situation in Italy after the parliamentary elections on June 7. He pointed out that the people's democratic forces in Italy have gained new confidence, prestige, and strength from the victory in this parliamentary election. The results of the election proved that the democratic consciousness of the Italian people has been enhanced. Now they firmly demand better material conditions, a more rational system, and a better life. But on the other hand, the leaders of the ruling group of the Christian Democratic Party are desperately clamoring to deny the need to make any changes to the political line they have implemented in the past. Therefore, the Italian Communist Party must once again widely mobilize the masses, launch active work and political struggles inside and outside the parliament, demand respect for the results of this election, and strive to form a government with new components that conforms to the results of this election and conforms to the hopes and wishes of the majority of voters.

Pollitt's article comprehensively analyzes the resolutions of the annual conferences of various industrial unions in the United Kingdom this year, based on the situation of these annual conferences, and points out the tendency of the general masses of British trade unions, the Labor Party, and the Cooperative Party to turn to the left. The article emphasizes that the British working class urgently demands that Britain have its own independent policy, end its dependence on American monopoly capital, and develop trade between the East and the West. And the fundamental solution to all the pressing problems of the working class can only be the implementation of a socialist program as stipulated by the Communist Party in "Britain's Road to Socialism." Therefore, under the current situation, promoting this program is one of the most important political tasks of the British Communist Party.

Akache's article discusses the course and achievements of the Algerian Communist Party's years of struggle to form and expand the National Democratic Front. The article points out that the position of the Algerian Communist Party in the national liberation struggle has been consolidated. It has achieved victories in the municipal elections in April and May this year, greatly strengthening its position. This is due to its tireless work in the struggle against imperialism to achieve genuine national unity, and is due to its correct national policy, which has put forward and implemented clear slogans for national independence, bread, peace and land.

Xinhua News Agency, In the book review column, this issue published Ao. Brown's article "The Truth About New China", introducing the book "China's New Creative Age" written by Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury in England, after two visits to China.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第二十八期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十八期中文版已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“协商——和平解决国际问题的道路”的社论。社论指出，世界和平理事会六月间布达佩斯会议所通过的展开世界争取协商运动的宣言和其他决议，都是具有巨大的动员力量和组织力量的文件。这些决议是根据千百万见解不同、职业不同的人们的要求和愿望而作出的。它们已经得到了各国人民的热烈响应和一致拥护。各国人民将以各种各样的组织形式来表示他们争取和平解决一切争端的要求。可是，在解决那些使国际局势复杂化的问题的道路上，是有不少困难的。在美国和其他资本主义国家，有着人数不多但是具有势力的集团，它们公开反对协商，或者口头上表示愿意协商，实际上却继续实行它们的“武力政策”、“冷战”和扩张军备的政策。因此，必须提高警惕，也就是说，要善于预见帝国主义阵营侵略集团的阴谋诡计，善于在人民群众面前无情地揭露它们，孤立它们。社论接着说：密切联系广大群众的共产党和工人党认识到，维护和平的斗争获得成功的保证，首先在于加强和扩大工人阶级的团结和全体劳动人民的团结。在展开全面的世界争取和平协商运动中，各国人民争取和平的斗争将获得新的力量。这个运动的组织正在日趋完善，它的群众基础正在日益扩大，和平力量迫使战争势力退却的保证就在这里。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂的“意大利议会选举后争取和平、民主和人民福利的斗争”，英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特的“英国劳工运动的趋向”，阿尔及利亚共产党书记艾哈迈德·阿卡契的“争取阿尔及利亚人民的民族民主阵线”。
    陶里亚蒂的文章是七月二日他在意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议上的报告的摘要。他的报告分析了意大利六月七日议会选举后的政治形势。他指出，意大利的人民民主力量，从这次议会选举的胜利中，获得了新的信心和威望，获得了新的力量。选举的结果证明了意大利人民的民主意识有了提高。现在他们坚决地要求较好的物质条件、较合理的制度、较好的生活。但在另一方面，天主教民主党统治集团的领袖们，已经在拚命叫嚣，否认有必要对他们过去所实行的政治路线作任何的改变。因此，意大利共产党必须再一次地广泛动员群众，在议会内外展开积极的工作和政治斗争，要求尊重这次选举的结果，争取组成一个具有新的成份，符合于这次大选结果并符合于大多数选民的希望和意愿的政府。
    波立特的文章根据英国各产业工会今年已经举行的年会的情况，综合地分析了这些年会的决议内容，指出英国工会、工党和合作党的一般群众正向左转的趋向。文章着重指出，英国工人阶级迫切要求英国有它自己的独立的政策，结束对美国垄断资本的依赖性，发展东方和西方之间的贸易。而解决工人阶级一切迫切问题的根本的办法，只能是实行像共产党在“英国走向社会主义的道路”里所规定的那样的一个社会主义纲领。因此，在目前局势下宣传这个纲领，是英国共产党最重要的政治任务之一。
    阿卡契的文章论述阿尔及利亚共产党多年来为组成和扩大民族民主阵线而斗争的经过和成就。文章指出，阿尔及利亚共产党在民族解放斗争中的地位已经巩固。它在今年四月间和五月间的市政选举中已取得了胜利，大大地加强了自己的地位。这是由于它在反对帝国主义的斗争中，为争取真正的民族团结进行了不倦的工作，是由于它有着正确的民族政策，提出了而且执行着争取民族独立、面包、和平与土地的明确口号。
    本期在书评栏中刊载了奥·布朗的“新中国的真相”一文，介绍英国坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊在两次访问中国后写成的“中国的新创造时代”一书。　（新华社）
