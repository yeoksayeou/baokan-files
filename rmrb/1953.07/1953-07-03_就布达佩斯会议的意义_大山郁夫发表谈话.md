Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: The "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an interview on the 1st with Professor Ikuo Oyama of Japan, a recipient of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace" who is currently visiting Moscow, under the title "Strengthening Friendship Among Peoples of All Countries."

Oyama Ikuo said: I would like to talk to Soviet youth about my impressions of the World Peace Council's Budapest Conference. The resolutions passed at this conference are directly related to Asian countries fighting for their national independence, and also to other countries suffering from foreign oppression, including Japan. The significance of these resolutions for our country is inestimable, and they will expand Japan's peace movement. Japan's peace movement will take the appeals in these resolutions as its main slogans. At a time when people of all strata in Japan are fighting for peace, for friendship among nations, and for the national independence of their homeland, the Budapest Conference will be a tremendous moral support for them. Oyama Ikuo pointed out that at present, the Japanese people are showing a strong interest in the countries of the peace camp, and we are learning more and more about the real situation of your lives.

Oyama Ikuo said: "Japanese youth are demonstrating examples of selfless struggle under difficult conditions. Japanese students are fighting for better study and research conditions, and at the same time they are actively participating in the nationwide movement against rearming Japan and against allowing foreign troops to establish military bases on our soil. Today, in many cities and villages, young people are preparing to participate in the World Youth Congress and Festival. Many of our young compatriots are eager to participate in this upcoming grand gathering showcasing the friendship of world youth. However, most of them will not be able to realize their wishes. When I left Japan, the students of Tokyo and Kyoto asked me to convey their greetings to the youth and students of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies on their behalf."

    就布达佩斯会议的意义
    大山郁夫发表谈话
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“共产主义青年团真理报”一日以“加强各国人民间的友谊”为题，登载了目前正在莫斯科访问的“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人、日本大山郁夫教授对该报记者的谈话。
    大山郁夫说：我很愿意向苏联青年谈一下我对于世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的感想。这届会议通过的决议跟正在为祖国的独立而斗争的亚洲国家有直接关系，跟其他遭受外国压迫的国家，包括日本在内，也有直接关系。本届会议的决议对我国的意义是难以估计的，这些决议将扩大日本的和平运动。日本的和平运动将把这些决议中的号召作为主要的口号。在日本各阶层人民为和平、为各民族间的友谊、为祖国的民族独立而斗争的时候，布达佩斯会议对他们将是一种巨大的道义上的支持。大山郁夫指出，目前，日本人民对和平阵营各国表示出强烈的兴趣，我们对你们的生活的真实情况知道得愈来愈多了。
    大山郁夫说：“日本青年在艰苦的条件下表现出忘我斗争的榜样。日本的学生正在为争取较好的读书和研究条件而斗争，同时他们也积极参加全国性的反对重新武装日本和反对允许外国军队在我国土地上建立军事基地的运动。今天，在许多城市和乡村中，青年们正为参加世界青年代表大会和联欢节作着筹备工作。我国许多青年同胞们都很想参加这即将来到的表现世界青年友好的盛大集会。可是，他们中大多数人将不能实现他们的愿望。当我离开日本时，东京和京都的学生请我代表他们向苏联和各人民民主国家的青年和学生们问好。”
