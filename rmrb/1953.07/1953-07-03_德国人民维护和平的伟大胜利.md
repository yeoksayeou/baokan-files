    The Great Victory of the German People in Defending Peace

    The government and people of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) recently took resolute actions to thoroughly smash the fascist provocations of the U.S. imperialists and their puppet Adenauer clique against the democratic sector of Berlin and other parts of the GDR. This is a great victory for the German people, and also a great victory for the camp of peace and democracy and the world peace movement. The resolute struggle of the German people to defend peace and the glorious victory they have achieved in the struggle prove the consolidation and superiority of the people's democratic system in the GDR, and prove that the strong development of German democratic forces is sufficient to defeat all the despicable and sordid provocative plots manufactured by the war instigators.

    The disturbance that occurred in the democratic sector of Berlin on June 17 was provoked by fascist special agent bandits who infiltrated from West Berlin. They infiltrated industrial enterprises in the democratic sector of Berlin to incite work stoppages, organize riots, arson, robbery, and attacks on democratic government agencies and the people's police, and at one point kidnapped GDR Deputy Prime Minister Otto Nuschke, in an attempt to create chaos and disputes within the GDR. However, with the strong support of all the German working people and with the help of the Soviet occupation authorities, the GDR government took timely and effective measures to quickly suppress the criminal actions provoked by the fascist bandits. Under the strong pressure of the German people and peace-loving people all over the world, the U.S. military authorities in West Berlin had to escort Nuschke, who had been kidnapped to West Berlin, back.

    Various irrefutable facts and evidence have confirmed that this provocative incident manufactured by the warmongers of the United States and West Germany was premeditated and planned for a long time. The bandits who participated in this riot and were captured after being sent from West Berlin have confessed that they were employed and dispatched by the U.S. intelligence agencies. The U.S. news agencies have also had to admit that this incident was conspired by the U.S. imperialists and the West German rulers. After the failure of the provocative plot, the U.S., British, and French commanders in West Berlin even made so-called "protests" against the Soviet occupation authorities' measures to suppress the riots, attempting to use this to shirk their responsibility for the provocative incident. However, this move cannot distort the universally recognized truth and is only enough to make their sinister conspiracy more apparent.

    The purpose of the provocative incident launched by the imperialist provocateurs in Berlin was not only to undermine the construction achievements of democratic Germany and the people's democratic system, but also to conspire to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the German question and the easing of international tensions. Recently, due to the widespread response to the Soviet Union's peace initiative to resolve international disputes through consultation, the movement of the German people demanding the peaceful restoration of German unity and making Germany a peaceful, democratic, and independent country has also risen more and more. In order to support the efforts of the people of the world to strive for the easing of international tensions, the government of the German Democratic Republic recently adopted a number of measures to promote understanding between the East and West of Germany, and at the same time adopted further decisions to improve the people's lives. These are conducive to Germany's move towards unity, peace, democracy and independence, and have been supported by the German people and peace-loving people all over the world. Precisely because of this, the U.S. and West German warmongers who attempted to keep Germany permanently divided and push Germany into war became alarmed and anxious. U.S. and British news agencies have revealed the uneasiness of these warmongers, admitting that the "peaceful, friendly, and reasonable" policies adopted by democratic Germany "have aroused widespread expectations for unification in West Germany, thus weakening Adenauer's position." The warmongers in the U.S. ruling clique are unwilling to see the restoration of German unification, and they have long clamored to "cross that arbitrarily created dividing line that separates the two Germanys." However, the firm stance and unremitting efforts taken by the Soviet Union regarding the peaceful settlement of the German question, and the German people's strong will to defend peace, have already caused a major failure in the plans of this group of warmongers.

    The will of the broad masses of the German people to demand unity and peace can never be shaken by any means of terror or despicable conspiracies. As the Soviet "Pravda" pointed out in its editorial on April 25: "It is obvious that in resolving the German question, it is necessary to take into account the vital interests of all Germany's neighbors and the interests of consolidating peace in Europe, and first of all the national aspirations of the German people." The German people, including those living in West Germany, have long expressed their opposition to the Bonn and Paris treaties, which divide Germany and prepare for war. Any provocation by reactionary forces hostile to peace and hostile to the German people can only make the German people more vigilant and further strengthen the struggle for unity, independence, and peace. Facts have proven that the riot in Berlin manufactured by Western provocateurs has not weakened but greatly strengthened the solidarity between the German people and their beloved Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the democratic German government. Millions of working people in democratic Germany have held demonstrations and rallies, and have taken practical actions, expressing their trust in their own government and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and insisting on their determination to fight for the interests of peace and the unity of Germany. They deeply realize only by uniting more closely around their own government and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany can they be able to defeat the imperialists' war provocations.

    The German people's struggle against the enemy's sabotage conspiracies and for national unity, independence, and peace is "supported by many." Peace-loving people all over the world, especially the great Soviet people, have condemned the provocative crimes of the imperialist fascists and expressed their active support for the heroic struggle of the working people of democratic Germany. Under the leadership of the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and with the support of the people of the world, the German people will certainly be able to continue to frustrate any provocations and attacks by the enemy, and finally achieve the unity, independence, and peace of Germany.

### 德国人民维护和平的伟大胜利

    德国人民维护和平的伟大胜利
    德意志民主共和国政府和人民最近以坚决的行动，彻底粉碎了美帝国主义者及其傀儡阿登纳集团对柏林民主区和德意志民主共和国其他地方的法西斯挑衅。这是德国人民的一个伟大胜利，也是和平民主阵营及世界和平运动的一个伟大胜利。德国人民为维护和平所进行的坚决斗争和在斗争中所取得光辉的胜利，证明了德意志民主共和国的人民民主制度的巩固和优越性，证明了德国民主力量的强大发展，足以击败战争挑拨者所制造的一切卑鄙龌龊的挑衅阴谋。
    柏林民主区六月十七日所发生的骚动，是从西柏林潜入的法西斯特务匪徒挑拨起来的。他们潜入柏林民主区各工业企业中煽动停工，组织暴动，纵火抢劫，袭击民主政府机关和人民警察，并一度绑架了德意志民主共和国副总理奥托·努舍克，以图在德意志民主共和国境内造成混乱和纠纷。可是，德意志民主共和国政府在全体德国劳动人民的有力支持下，并得到苏联占领当局的帮助，采取了及时的有效措施，迅速地把法西斯匪徒所挑起的这种罪恶行动镇压下去了。西柏林的美国军事当局在德国人民及全世界和平人民的强大压力之下，不得不把被劫持到西柏林的努舍克护送回来。
    各种无可辩驳的事实和证据业已证实，美国和西德的好战分子所制造的这次挑衅事件，是蓄谋已久的，经过长期策划的。参加这次骚乱而被捕获的从西柏林派来的匪徒已经招认，他们是受美国谍报机关雇佣和派遣的。美国通讯社也不得不承认，这次事件是由美帝国主义者和西德统治者所阴谋布置的。在挑衅阴谋失败以后，西柏林的美、英、法司令官竟然对苏联占领当局镇压暴乱的措施提出所谓“抗议”，企图借此推卸他们对挑衅事件应负的罪责。但是，这种举动绝不能歪曲人所共见的事实真相，只足以使他们的罪恶阴谋欲盖弥彰。
    帝国主义挑拨者在柏林发动的挑衅事件的目的，不仅是企图破坏民主德国的建设成就和人民民主制度，而且是阴谋阻挠德国问题的和平解决和国际紧张局势的缓和。最近以来，由于苏联提出各国以协商方式解决国际争端的和平倡议在全世界范围获得了广泛的响应，德国人民要求以和平途径恢复德国统一并使德国成为一个和平、民主和独立的国家的运动也愈益高涨。德意志民主共和国政府为支持世界人民争取缓和国际紧张局势的努力，最近采取了一些促进德国东西两部谅解的措施，同时采取了进一步改善人民生活的决定。这些都是有利于德国走向统一、和平、民主与独立，并受到了德国人民的拥护和全世界爱好和平人民的支持的。正因为这样，那些企图使德国永久陷于分裂和把德国推向战争的美国的和西德的好战分子就惊惶和焦灼起来。美英通讯社曾透露这些好战分子的不安情绪，承认民主德国采取的“和平、友好与讲理”的政策，“已经引起了西德方面对统一的普遍期望，因而削弱了阿登纳的地位”。美国统治集团中的好战分子不愿看到德国统一的恢复，他们早就叫嚣说，要“越过那条将两个德国隔开的任意造成的分界线”。但是，苏联关于和平解决德国问题所采取的坚定立场和不倦努力，德国人民维护和平的坚强意志，已使这一班好战分子的图谋遭受了一次重大的失败。
    德国广大人民要求统一与和平的意志，决不是任何恐怖手段或者卑劣阴谋所能动摇的。正如苏联“真理报”四月二十五日的社论所指出的：“很明显，在解决德国问题时，必须考虑到德国的一切邻国的切身利益、巩固欧洲和平的利益，而首先必须考虑到德国人民的民族愿望。”包括居住在西德的德国人民早已明白表示他们反对分裂德国和准备战争的波恩和巴黎条约。敌视和平与敌视德国人民的反动势力的任何挑衅，只能使德国人民更加提高警惕，进一步加强争取统一、独立与和平的斗争。事实证明西方挑拨者在柏林制造的骚乱事件，使得德国人民与他们所爱戴的德国统一社会党和民主德国政府之间的团结不是削弱，而是大大地加强了。民主德国千百万的劳动人民举行了示威、集会，并采取了实际行动，表示出了他们对自己的政府和统一社会党的信任，坚持为和平的利益与德国的统一而斗争的决心。他们深深认识到，只有更紧密地团结在他们自己的政府和德国统一社会党的周围，才能够击败帝国主义者的战争挑衅。
    德国人民反对敌人的破坏阴谋及争取国家统一、独立与和平的斗争是“得道多助”的。全世界爱好和平的人民、首先是伟大的苏联人民都已纷纷谴责帝国主义法西斯分子的挑衅罪行，并对民主德国的劳动人民的英勇斗争表示积极的支持。德国人民在德意志民主共和国政府和德国统一社会党的领导下，在全世界人民的支援下，一定能够继续挫败敌人的任何挑衅和进攻，而最后取得德国的统一、独立与和平。
