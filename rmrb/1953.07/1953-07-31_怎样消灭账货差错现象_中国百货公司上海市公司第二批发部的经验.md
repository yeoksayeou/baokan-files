How to Eliminate Discrepancies Between Accounts and Goods
——The Experience of the Second Wholesale Department of the Shanghai Company of China Department Store
Lin Huimei

The phenomenon of discrepancies between accounts and goods, and inconsistencies between accounts, is widespread in state-owned department stores. In the past, this phenomenon was also very serious in the Second Wholesale Department of the Shanghai Company of China Department Store. At the end of each month, there were often three or four hundred discrepancies, and sometimes even more than a thousand. Each business group (composed of ten to twenty salespeople) often had dozens of discrepancies, and the amount of money from goods sold was often short. These shortages had to be compensated for by the salespeople on a pro rata basis, which placed a heavy ideological burden on them, made them less enthusiastic about their work, and affected unity.

The main reasons for the errors were: a lax working system, unclear division of labor, and unclear responsibilities. Salespeople and custodians in the business groups would do this work today and that work tomorrow, resulting in chaotic storage of goods. Sometimes, one type of commodity would be stored in five or six places. During inventory, if it couldn't be found, it would be reported as a loss; if it was found, it would be reported as a gain. The salespeople said: Errors in goods are "major errors on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th, and minor errors every day." The system for taking goods and paying for them was also unreasonable. After a salesperson closed a sale with a customer, the salesperson would issue an invoice and give it to the customer to pay at the cashier, and then the customer would come back to pick up the goods. This provided an opportunity for some speculators. They often rushed to buy popular goods as soon as the wholesale department opened, and after receiving the invoice, they would go out to raise money. Some would only come back to pick up the goods after a day or two, or even refuse to take the goods after several days. This phenomenon made it very difficult to manage funds and seriously affected the turnover of goods and capital. Salespeople often dared not sell popular goods even when there was still a certain quantity in stock, preventing some customers who came with money to buy the goods from being able to do so.

After the Shanghai Company of China Department Store's Second Wholesale Department implemented the economic accounting system, it focused on the problems existing in business operations. First, each business department selected personnel who were active, responsible, and familiar with the business, and invited comrades from the Municipal Bureau of Commerce to form a working group to conduct special research. Through mass identification of loopholes and investigation of causes, and by extensively soliciting opinions, a new set of systems was initially drafted: the sales, storage, cashier, and accounting personnel of each business group were organized together, implementing a clear and strict division of labor: salespeople specialized in sales, custodians specialized in storage, cashiers specialized in collecting money, and accountants specialized in accounting, and each was responsible for certain varieties of goods. After a salesperson closed a sale with a customer, the invoice was directly handed over to the cashier for payment, and the goods were given upon receipt of the ticket. In this way, it was easier to clarify responsibilities when errors occurred.

In order to ensure that the new system could be effectively implemented, three steps were taken in the process of revision and implementation:

The first step was to have the masses discuss, revise, and supplement the system, and eliminate obstacles to its implementation. When the new system was first discussed, the leadership failed to clearly explain the spirit and purpose of reforming the new system to the masses, resulting in various opposing ideas. For example, some groups wanted to be abolished or merged, and individual group leaders were concerned about their own positions, so they emphasized the difficulties of implementing the new system. Some believed that the new system was not as good as the old system, or that the new system was good but would not work. Others felt that with dedicated personnel for dedicated tasks in the future, the responsibility would be too great to bear. This seriously hindered the progress of the discussion. In response to this situation, the leadership held separate meetings of key members of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League, and launched criticism and self-criticism against these ideas. The leading cadres reviewed their shortcomings in not clearly explaining the purpose of the new system and not clearly relying on key members to lead the thinking of the masses. At the meeting, the thinking of the key members was first unified, so that they could play a positive leading role among the masses. The masses then engaged in extensive discussions, so that the new system could be revised and supplemented, and ideological obstacles could be eliminated.

The second step was to conduct key trials and lay the foundation for comprehensive promotion. Under the condition that the new system had basically won the support of the masses, the stationery group, which had relatively few ideological concerns about the implementation of the new system and had complex commodity varieties and work, was selected for key trials. When everyone was relatively familiar with the operating procedures of the new system, the goods were further inventoried, and the method of completely clarifying responsibilities was tried. After twenty days of trial implementation, the number of errors, which used to be at least thirty or forty, was reduced to only four incorrect item numbers, and there was no shortage of funds, proving that the new system was good. Subsequently, a forum was held, and the stationery group introduced the experience and benefits of implementing the new system. Other groups, having seen the facts with their own eyes, automatically requested the rapid implementation of the new system.

The third step was to comprehensively promote the system, based on the experience of the stationery group's trial implementation, under the condition that the vast majority of personnel had recognized the new system and requested its implementation.

The new system has initially achieved results after being implemented for more than a month: 1. The phenomenon of chaotic goods and numerous errors has been eliminated. After clarifying responsibilities, everyone has established a new work attitude and has come up with many new methods to improve their work. Custodians regularly inspect goods at all times, arrange goods in an orderly manner, and can often check with salespeople and accountants. At the end of May, the phenomenon of losing money and discrepancies between accounts and goods was eliminated during inventory. 2. Work efficiency has been improved. In the past, it took three or four hours to clear accounts every day, and it was still unclear; now it only takes half an hour to an hour. In the past, it took seven or eight hours to inventory at the end of each month; now it only takes three or four hours. 3. Speculators have no opportunities, and legitimate merchants are satisfied. On the first day of implementing the new system, a dozen speculators rushed to buy popular goods, but they did not bring money and could not buy them. Many legitimate merchants felt satisfied. 4. The turnover of goods and capital has been accelerated. Because the "selling short" accidents have been eliminated, the accounts and goods are consistent, and business groups can grasp the inventory and sales situation at any time. Furthermore, they can predict the amount of goods that should be purchased and sold each day, reducing unnecessary inventory of goods, and reducing cash inventory from a fixed amount of 0.5 days to 0.28 days.

    怎样消灭账货差错现象
    ——中国百货公司上海市公司第二批发部的经验
  　林惠美
    国营百货公司中账货、账账不符的现象是普遍存在着的。中国百货公司上海市公司第二批发部过去这种现象也很严重，每到月终盘货时，经常有三、四百笔差错发生，甚至有多到一千多笔的时候。每个业务组（十至二十多个营业员组成）经常有几十笔差错，货款常常短缺。这些短缺的款要营业员平均摊赔，营业员思想负担很重，工作不起劲，并且影响了团结。
    发生差错的主要原因是：工作制度不严密，业务分工不明确，责任不清。业务组的销售员和保管员，今天干干这种工作、明天干干那种工作，把商品存放得混乱不堪，有时一种商品放在五、六处，盘点时找不着就报损，找着了就报益。营业员说：商品的差错是“大错三、六、九，小错日日有。”取货交款制度也规定得不合理，在销货员与顾客成交后，由销货员开发票，交给顾客自己到收款处交款，然后再回来取货。这样就给一些投机商人以可乘之机。他们常常在批发部开门时，就来抢购一批热销货，拿到了发票再出去筹款，有隔一、二天才来取货的，甚至隔几天他不愿要就不来取货了。这种现象使资金的掌握发生了很大困难，严重影响商品流转和资金周转。营业员常常在热销货还存有一定数量的时候，就不敢再卖了，使得一些拿款来买货的顾客反买不着货。
    上海市百货公司第二批发部在实行经济核算制以后，针对着业务经营上存在的问题，先由各业务部门选出工作积极负责、业务比较熟悉的人员，并邀请了市商业局的同志，组成工作组，进行专门研究。通过群众找漏洞、查原因，广泛地征求意见，初步拟出了一套新制度：把各营业组的销货、保管、收款、记账的成员都组织在一起，实行明确严密的分工：销售员专管销售，保管员专管保管，收款员专管收款，记账员专管记账，且各对一定品种负责。销售员和顾客成交后，发票改由销售员直接交收款员收款，收款后凭票给货，这样，发生了错误就好弄清责任了。
    为了使新制度能切实执行，在修正与贯彻过程中采取了三个步骤：
    第一步由群众讨论，修正补充，扫除推行中的障碍。开始讨论新制度时，由于领导上没有把改革新制度的精神和目的向群众讲清楚，产生了各种对抗思想。如有些小组要撤销或合并，个别小组长就顾虑到本身职位，因而一味强调实行新制度困难。有的认为新制度不如老制度好，或者说新制度好是好，就怕行不通。也有的认为以后专人专责，责任太大吃不消。这就严重地阻碍了讨论的进展。针对这一情况，领导上分别召开党、政、工、团的骨干分子会议，针对这些思想，展开了批评与自我批评；领导干部检讨了对新制度的目的交代不清，依靠骨干带动群众的思想不明确的缺点。在会上先打通了骨干分子的思想，使他们在群众中起积极带头作用。再由群众广泛讨论，使新制度得以修正补充，并扫除了思想障碍。
    第二步重点试行，打下全面推广的基础。在新制度基本上取得群众拥护的情况下，选择了对执行新制度的思想顾虑比较少，商品品种与工作较繁杂的文具组作重点试行，在大家对于新制度的操作程序比较熟悉时，再进一步盘点商品，试行完全划清职责的办法。经二十天的试行，过去至少有三、四十笔的差错，现在只有四笔货号搞错了，货款没有短缺，证实了这个新制度是好的。随后又召开座谈会，由文具组介绍执行新制度的经验与好处，其他小组亲眼看到了事实，自动要求迅速实行新制度。
    第三步，在绝大部分人员对新制度有了认识并要求实行的情况下，根据文具组试行的经验，进行了全面推广。
    新制度实行一个多月来，已初步获得成果：一、消灭了商品混乱，差错百出的现象。在明确职责后，大家都树立了新的劳动态度，想出了许多新办法，改进自己的工作。保管员随时随地检点商品，把商品陈列得有条不紊，且能经常与销售员、记账员核对。在五月底盘点时消灭了赔钱和账账、账货不符的现象。二、提高了工作效率。过去每天结算时间要三、四小时还算不清，现在每天只需半小时至一小时。过去每月终了盘货需七、八小时，现在只需三、四小时。三、使投机商人无机可投，正当商人满意。在实行新制度的第一天，就有十几个投机商人抢购热销货，因为没带钱来未买去。许多正当商人感到满意。四、加速了商品流转与资金周转。由于消灭了“卖空”事故，使账货、账账相符，业务组随时可以掌握商品库存与进销实况，进而可以预计每天应进可销的货额，减少了商品不必要的积压，并使现金库存由定额○·五天降到○·二八天。
