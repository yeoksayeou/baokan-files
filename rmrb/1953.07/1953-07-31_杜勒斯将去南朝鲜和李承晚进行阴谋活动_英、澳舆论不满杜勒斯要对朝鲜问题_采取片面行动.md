Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 30th, special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Dulles, who ignited the Korean War on the 38th parallel three years ago, is now going to South Korea after the Korean War has just achieved an armistice. He announced at a press conference in Washington on the 28th that he would go to South Korea on August 2nd to discuss "matters of common concern that will arise during the armistice" with Syngman Rhee.

The Korean War ended with the failure of the American aggression plan. However, it is more difficult for people like Dulles to learn any lessons from this war than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. Dulles announced that he would take four senators to South Korea. These four are Republican William Knowland, Alexander Smith, Democrat Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Russell. All four are the most enthusiastic supporters of MacArthurism and the most active supporters of the Kuomintang bandit gang and the Syngman Rhee clique. It goes without saying what Dulles is going to do in South Korea with such a group of people.

Dulles openly announced at the press conference that he would discuss three "main issues" with Syngman Rhee. These three issues are:

First, to formulate the common demands of the United States and Syngman Rhee for the political conference, including how to achieve the unification of Korea and the withdrawal of foreign troops.

Second, ways to provide economic assistance to Syngman Rhee.

Third, to negotiate a U.S.-Rhee mutual security treaty, which will allow the United States to have the right to station troops in South Korea.

Judging from these three points alone, it is already clear that the purpose of Dulles' trip is to apply plaster and bandages to Syngman Rhee, who has been battered, give him a few coins, and then push him onto the battlefield as a thug. As for whether there are "minor" but more important issues in Dulles' briefcase, it remains to be seen what Dulles will do in the future.

It is not surprising that Dulles is so fond of Syngman Rhee, who has consistently clamored to undermine the armistice, even at the cost of trekking across the ocean. This is not only because Dulles is extremely unwilling to accept such a disastrous failure of the Korean War he planned, but also because he and Syngman Rhee are birds of a feather, and the two are very compatible. Some of the words Dulles said at the press conference on the 28th proved that this white-gloved American "diplomat," like Syngman Rhee, was originally a complete rogue.

Dulles, whose teeth itch with hatred for the Korean people because of his own failure, has to temporarily satisfy himself with retaliating with his tongue. At the press conference, he slandered the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as "an ethereal government." His reason was: "It was difficult to find someone from North Korea to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement." Dulles's words remind people of the self-willed, narrow-minded, extremely dull, but extremely self-confident bureaucrat in the writings of the great Russian writer Shchedrin, who wanted to close off another country. However, it is still forgivable that the bureaucrat only saw that other country from the edge of the sky and made this absurd conclusion. After Dulles personally experienced the heroic and strong attacks of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and therefore had to sign the armistice agreement with its Supreme Commander and armistice negotiation representatives, he still said that this was "an ethereal government," which made him ten thousand times more stupid and ignorant than the bureaucrat in Shchedrin's writing. Dulles's rogue tone is so despicable and shameless that it is hard to believe that it came from the mouth of the US Secretary of State.

What Dulles hates is not only the Korean people, he especially hates the Chinese people. He hates that the Chinese people have been liberated, and especially hates that the Chinese people helped the Korean people defeat his aggression plan, making him unable to achieve the goal of annexing all of Korea. He thought that as long as he destroyed the unity of the Chinese and Korean people, he could achieve his aggressive goals. He thought about it and came up with a plan. He told American reporters that Communist China "annexed" North Korea. But Dulles's arrow missed its target. The friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people can never be hurt by Dulles's arrows. The more Dulles sows discord, the more the Chinese and Korean people feel the preciousness and necessity of mutual unity, and the more they will give Dulles and his ilk a severe blow.

Openly playing the rogue, fabricating rumors and slanders, and sowing discord—this is Dulles's forte. But no matter what Dulles is willing to say, the Chinese and Korean people still stand in front of him united like a mountain. If he refuses to learn the lessons of the three-year Korean War, he will continue to suffer more failures.

Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's preparations to go to South Korea to meet with Syngman Rhee and his remarks at a press conference have aroused criticism from British and Australian people and newspapers.

Reuters said: "This makes the British extremely uneasy, because it suggests that the United States will take unilateral action on the future of Korea, and his contact with Syngman Rhee will be more than his contact with other allies."

Reuters quoted a British government official. The British government official, after studying Dulles's remarks at the press conference, said: "We are very worried that Syngman Rhee may hinder the end of the Korean War. We think he is an extremely hateful person and cannot place too much hope on him." He believes that there is now a serious crisis, that the United States "underestimates" the British people's aversion to Syngman Rhee and his actions.

The British "Times" said: "When Dulles announced the news that he would meet with Syngman Rhee for a week, it seemed that he had completely ignored the opinions of the United States' other allies and partners in the United Nations." The newspaper said that it seemed that Dulles had decided to oppose any appropriate negotiations. The newspaper said that the United States' allies could not help but ask, "Is the continued division of Korea not more certain than ever?"

The Australian Sydney "Tribune" said: In the words of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, the political conference stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement is "a waste of time." The newspaper said: It is discouraging to hear Syngman Rhee explicitly say that the United States has guaranteed that if the political conference proves to be a "trick" and has no results after three months, it will follow South Korea out of the conference. "This is tantamount to adding a time limit even before the UN General Assembly has had a chance to consider the arrangement of the political conference. This also injects extreme distrust, suspicion and hostile emotions into the conference." The newspaper pointed out that Dulles said that the mutual security treaty he was preparing to sign with South Korea would give the United States the right to station troops in Korea, while the armistice agreement puts the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops before all negotiations, so "the contradiction is very obvious, although Dulles is indifferent to this contradiction."

### 杜勒斯将去南朝鲜和李承晚进行阴谋活动  英、澳舆论不满杜勒斯要对朝鲜问题“采取片面行动”

    杜勒斯将去南朝鲜和李承晚进行阴谋活动
    英、澳舆论不满杜勒斯要对朝鲜问题“采取片面行动”
    【新华社开城三十日电】本社特派记者江南报道：三年前在三八线燃起朝鲜战火的杜勒斯，现在，在朝鲜刚刚获得停战之后，又要到南朝鲜去了。二十八日他在华盛顿的一个记者招待会上宣布，他将在八月二日到南朝鲜去和李承晚商谈“在停战期间将会发生的共同关心的事情”。
    朝鲜战争是以美国的侵略计划失败而结束的。但是，要杜勒斯这类人从这个战争中接受什么教训，比要骆驼穿过针眼还难。杜勒斯宣布他将要带四个参议员到南朝鲜去。这四个人是共和党的威廉·诺兰，亚历山大·史密斯，民主党的林顿·约翰逊和理查德·鲁塞尔。这四个人都是麦克阿瑟主义的最热心的拥护者，国民党匪帮和李承晚集团的最积极的支持者。杜勒斯带着这么一帮人到南朝鲜去干什么，这是用不着多说的了。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上公开宣布说，他要和李承晚讨论三个“主要的问题”。这三个问题是：
    一、拟定美国与李承晚对政治会议的共同主张，其中包括如何达到统一朝鲜和撤退外国军队的目的。
    二、给予李承晚经济援助的办法。
    三、谈判美李共同安全条约，这项条约将允许美国有驻兵南朝鲜的权利。
    单从这三点看来，人们已经可以清楚地知道，杜勒斯此行的目的，就是去给被打得焦头烂额的李承晚敷上一张膏药，缠上绷带，并且给他几文钱，然后再把他推上阵去作打手。至于在杜勒斯的公事皮包里是不是还有名为“次要”实则更为重要的问题，这还要看杜勒斯将来的作为。
    杜勒斯不惜跋涉重洋，对于一贯叫嚣要破坏停战的李承晚如此宠爱，是不足为怪的。这不仅因为杜勒斯对于他所策划的朝鲜战争遭到这样惨重的失败极不甘心，而且也因为他和李承晚是一丘之貉，两人十分气味相投。杜勒斯二十八日在记者招待会上说的一些话，证明这个戴着白手套的美国“外交家”和李承晚一样，原来是一个十足的流氓。
    因为自己的失败而把朝鲜人民恨得牙根发痒的杜勒斯，只好暂时满足于用舌头来报复一下。他在记者招待会上诬蔑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府是“一个虚无飘渺的政府”。他的理由是：“在签订朝鲜停战协定时，找一个北朝鲜来的人签字都很困难。”杜勒斯的这些话，使人想起俄国伟大作家谢德林笔下的那个想把另外一个国家封闭起来的、刚愎自用、眼界十分狭小、生性十分鲁钝、可是极端自信的官僚。可是那个官僚只是从天际云边看见了那另外一个国家，他作出这个荒唐的结论，还总算情有可原。杜勒斯在亲自领教了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英勇坚强的打击，并且因此而不得不和它的最高司令官和停战谈判代表签订停战协定之后，还来说这是“一个虚无飘渺的政府”，这就使他比谢德林笔下的官僚更要蠢笨无知到了万倍。杜勒斯这种流氓腔是卑鄙无耻到如此田地，以致人们很难相信是出自美国国务卿之口。
    杜勒斯恨的不单是朝鲜人民，他特别恨中国人民。他恨中国人民获得了解放，尤其恨中国人民帮助朝鲜人民挫败了他的侵略计划，使他不能达到并吞全部朝鲜的目的。他以为只要破坏了中朝人民的团结，他就可以达到他的侵略目的了，他左思右想，计上心来。他向美国记者们说，共产党中国“吞并”了北朝鲜。可是杜勒斯这一支暗箭是射错了标的了。朝中人民的友谊和团结，绝不是杜勒斯的暗箭所能中伤的。杜勒斯越是挑拨离间，朝中人民就越是感到相互团结的可贵和必要，就越是要给杜勒斯之流以狠狠的打击。
    公开地耍流氓、造谣诬蔑、挑拨离间——这就是杜勒斯的看家本领。可是无论杜勒斯愿意怎么说，朝中人民还是团结得像一座大山一样屹立在他的面前，如果他不肯接受三年朝鲜战争的教训，他将要继续遭受更多的失败。
    【新华社三十日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯准备前往南朝鲜与李承晚会谈以及他在记者招待会上的谈话，引起英国、澳大利亚人士和报纸的抨击。
    路透社说：“这使英国人极感不安，因为这暗示，美国将对朝鲜的未来问题采取片面行动，他与李承晚的接触将比与其他盟国的接触更多。”
    路透社引述了一位英国政府人士的话。这位英国政府人士研究了杜勒斯在记者招待会上的谈话后说：“我们非常担心：李承晚可能阻挠结束朝鲜战争。我们认为他是一个极其可恶的人，不能对他寄以过大的希望。”他认为，现在存在着一种严重的危机，即美国“过低估计了”英国人对李承晚和他的行动的厌恶心理。
    英国“泰晤士报”说：“杜勒斯在宣布他将与李承晚会谈一星期的消息时，看来已完全不顾美国在联合国中的其他盟国与伙伴的意见。”该报说，看来杜勒斯已决定反对任何适当谈判。该报说，美国的盟国们不禁要问，“朝鲜继续分裂的情况不是比以往任何时候更肯定了吗？”
    澳大利亚悉尼“论坛报”说：用美国国务卿杜勒斯的话来说，朝鲜停战协定规定举行的政治会议，是“浪费时间”。该报说：听到李承晚明确地说，美国已保证如果在三个月后证明政治会议是“骗局”而没有结果的话就跟着南朝鲜退出会议，这是令人丧气的。“这等于是甚至在联合国大会还没有机会考虑政治会议的布置以前，就加上了时限。这还在会议中注入了极端的不信任、猜疑和敌对的情绪。”该报指出，杜勒斯说预备和南朝鲜订立的共同安全条约将给美国以在朝鲜驻扎部队的权利，而停战协定是把关于撤退全部外国军队的问题放在一切谈判中解决的问题之先的，所以，“矛盾是非常明显的，虽然杜勒斯对这种矛盾满不在乎”。
