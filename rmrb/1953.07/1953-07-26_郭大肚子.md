　　Guo Big Belly

　　Cui Ba Wa

　　Within dozens of miles around, mentioning Guo Big Belly, people's hatred boils over. His grey, simple tile-roofed house can be seen from afar. I don't know how much land he owns, but I often hear the old folks say: It would take half a day to walk to the edge of his fields. His son works for the government, and his brother is the deputy leader of the local militia; with money and power, who dares to provoke him?

　　"His heart has rotted before he's dead." Guo Big Belly is just such a fellow. Wearing his greasy, hemp-covered jacket, he hugs his belly with both hands, putting on a pitiful act, as he shuffles back and forth in the crowd. Whenever there is a period of scarcity or someone needs to ask him for help, he immediately stamps his foot and frowns: "Hey, why didn't you say so sooner? Whatever you need, just say the word, if we have it!" As if blaming you for not asking earlier. In reality, using his things is like having bad luck; his iron abacus clicks away, adding extra interest – not a penny can be escaped. Hmph! Which of the surrounding tenant farmers hasn't been drained dry by his calculations!

　　Once, during the New Year, my father couldn't pay back his debt and went to him to plead for an extension. He was lying on the bed, slowly hissing as he smoked opium. He lifted his neck, took a sip of tea, and squinted for a long time without saying a word. Suddenly, he sat up straight and said with a smile: "Hehe, it's nothing, please sit down for a moment!" As he spoke, he flicked his sleeve and slipped out. He was never seen again. After a while, his lackey came in and, without saying a word, forced us to pay the debt. In the end, he took our family's one mu of graveyard land as payment. Guo Big Belly is such a bloodless killer, with a sugar-coated mouth and a dagger in his heart.

　　One year in June, he was building a house, and he didn't hire the local "Tang General's Team" but instead brought in two teams of craftsmen from afar. We were all a little puzzled, wondering what trick he was up to now?

　　It was during the hottest days of summer, and the sun beat down relentlessly. Even squatting in the shade of a tree couldn't stop the sweat from pouring down. Hundreds of craftsmen worked under the scorching sun, their backs burned a purplish-red color, all toiling for him. Guo Big Belly wore a half-length silk jacket, his pants tied below his navel, fanning himself with a palm-leaf fan, looking around here and there. With a "creak," he lay down on a rattan chair under the grape trellis and said to the craftsmen: "This is a contracted job, work hard! You'll get that much money even if you finish it in one day!" But secretly, he gave this team a few packs of cigarettes and that team a few packs of cigarettes. He said: "Hurry, take it! Take it!" As if afraid others would see. "Even though it's a contracted job, I can see you guys are working really hard, fast, and well." He twirled his two dry, yellow, scraggly beard hairs and said: "I'm a person who likes things to be done neatly and quickly. I am the best of friends to people! You'll know that after a while. Haha!…" These craftsmen quickly became familiar with us, and they also knew that his brother was the deputy leader of the local militia, and he was a quick knife cutting tofu – a smooth operator on both sides, a scoundrel. Strangely enough, these two teams of craftsmen were like gods; the ones carrying bricks and the ones mixing mortar completed two months' worth of work in half a month. On the day of completion, Guo Big Belly was especially happy, his eyes narrowed into slits, busy inside and out; he carried a wine pot in his hand, and his mouth kept saying: "Ah! You guys are really capable! This time, you've really earned your money!"

　　The craftsmen looked at each other, raised their wine glasses, looked at the newly built house, and laughed heartily.

　　As soon as they put down their bowls, the weather changed. A flash of lightning, a clap of thunder. Before long, a torrential rain began to fall. From the east, from the west, from the south, from the north. The wind mixed with the rain, the rain followed the wind, pelting down like kernels of corn, sounding terrifying. For about half the night, I was half-asleep, and the dogs outside were barking fiercely. The rain was still pouring down, and I vaguely heard shouting and commotion in Guo Big Belly's courtyard; I didn't know what had happened.

　　The next morning, the sky cleared, and I opened the door to take a look. Oh, the courtyard wall of Guo Big Belly's house had collapsed in a big section. I walked to the edge of the yard and saw several people gathered at the bottom of the embankment, including Chen Maoyong and Wang Laowu, who were whispering to each other. I put on my clothes and went over to listen. I heard that something had happened last night; the local militia had dragged away two or three of Guo Big Belly's craftsmen to fill the draft quotas. The craftsmen had also beaten up seven or eight of the local militiamen. By dawn, they were all gone, and no one knew where those two teams of craftsmen had gone. Just as they were talking enthusiastically, Chen Maoyong pursed his lips, and everyone scattered. I turned around, and oh, Guo Big Belly was swaggering over with his walking stick. He said angrily to himself: "...A bunch of freeloaders. Making me this paper-thin work! Humph!" As soon as he got to the edge of the yard, he looked at us, paused, and said to Wang Laowu: "Look, what kind of world is this, grabbing my craftsmen as they please. Even the township head has to be reasonable!" He pouted and looked at us. No one paid attention to him for a long time. He slumped his butt, "Humph—" snorted from his nose, and mumbled as he climbed over the ridge. Wang Laowu looked at Chen Maoyong, spat at Guo Big Belly, and said: "Don't you try to dress up like an elephant in a camel's skin, I know what you are up to the second you wag your tail. Everything that hurts both God and man, you've done it all. Want to build a house without paying wages, humph, still want to turn things around, isn't this a trick you played with your brother! Go and fool ghosts!" Chen Maoyong pointed at Guo Big Belly's courtyard wall: "Look, this time he miscalculated everything, even his lackey militiamen didn't get anything good..." "Forget it, understanding in our hearts is better than anything else; 'Planting sorghum doesn't harvest buckwheat,' it's time for us to go to the fields." After speaking, people left.

　　Time passed quickly, and after a month or so, people no longer talked about this incident. One day, my father and I were weeding, and we returned home just as it was getting dark. My father was rinsing his feet on the ridge of the yard. Suddenly, we heard a gunshot on the mountain ridge, which startled me. I said: "I'm afraid someone is robbing Guo Big Belly?" My father covered my mouth: "Don't talk nonsense, it will be terrible if others hear it." As soon as he finished speaking, "Bang! Bang!" two more gunshots rang out, shaking the stone cliffs. After that, nothing could be heard. After the time it takes to smoke a pouch of tobacco, it sounded like Chen Maoyong's voice shouting from the back ridge: "Old Cui! Old Cui! Come quickly! Something happened at Guo Big Belly's house!" My father took two tight puffs of his tobacco, knocked it against the ground, and said with a smile: "To tell the truth, something happened to Guo Big Belly!" He stood up, tucked his pipe into his waist, "Let's go! Let's go and see!" I followed my father to Guo Big Belly's place.

　　We entered the yard and saw no one, no sound. When we reached the back yard, a stench filled the air. We were puzzled when we heard Chen Maoyong shout from the west: "Old Cui! Come quickly! It sounds like someone is moaning here." I lit a bundle of grass and walked under the grape trellis, and hey, what a sight! Someone was hanging from the mulberry tree, covered in blood, with a wad of cotton stuffed in his mouth, moaning. I raised the light higher and looked at his shiny head; I realized it was Guo Big Belly. Chen Maoyong slowly walked over and untied him. He slumped to the ground like a freshly slaughtered pig.

　　"Hush—" He let out a long breath. My father asked him: "What happened?" After a long time, Guo Big Belly wobbled his fleshy head, cried and said with a distressed face, between breaths, "Oh, I thought they were Latin speakers; I walked on the terrace... I asked, and they said... they were 'from the team'... The two people in front seemed familiar... Before I finished speaking, they pounced on me... stuffed my mouth, knocked me down and beat me... Ouch..." Wang Laowu yelled from the east wall: "Hey, his family is here, they're all hiding in the sweet potato cellar." His wife crawled out of the sweet potato cellar, threw away the child, and ran towards the house. She cried out, "Oh my god! How can I live now! My money is gone!" Guo Big Belly, "Puff" spat out white foam, trembled as he leaned his body in an effort to sit up and cursed, "You... money... you shameless woman... money is your daddy! I got beaten... Ouch—I should die—ouch—" His body stiffened, and he fell again. His wife didn't seem to hear, and she continued to run towards the house, lit a lamp, and looked around. The boxes and cabinets were untouched, nothing was missing, just two guns were gone. Only then did his wife calm down a little, sobbing, and walked over, wiping the dung off Guo Big Belly's body while muttering: "Oh, which ancestor of ours committed a sin? We have never offended anyone!" "That's right! You haven't offended anyone! Who doesn't know that you are the best of friends to people!" Wang Laowu folded his arms in front of his chest, his lips pursed tightly, looking askance at Guo Big Belly. Wang Laowu's words made everyone want to laugh, but they couldn't hold it in. Chen Maoyong snickered, and we walked away.

　　We walked a long distance before everyone burst out laughing. My father said, "Today is 'Meng Jiangnv married Liu Hai—both crying and laughing.'" Chen Maoyong patted Wang Laowu: "Old Wu! You're really good at seeing the cracks, you've dug up all his secrets. He's got one kettle that's not boiling and you pick it up and start boiling it!" Wang Laowu shook his head and raised his voice: "That's good, I haven't even said—" He shook his head and wobbled, grabbed his belly, and splayed his feet: "'I'm a person who likes things to be done neatly and quickly.'" He made everyone laugh again. "Hey!" Chen Maoyong grabbed my father's hand with one hand and Wang Laowu's hand with the other, and said quietly: "Folks! Didn't you hear him say: he was quite familiar with two people. Is it the team of craftsmen who were arrested who are back?" My father said: "Perhaps it is. If so, it's the few craftsmen who were arrested and came back with guns. Where else would they get guns?" Wang Laowu interrupted before he could finish speaking: "Bull—'One pile of dog shit stinks up three villages,' who within dozens of miles around hasn't been harmed by him! Isn't this as clear as a bald man's head. Don't say craftsmen, even I want to skin him alive!" Chen Maoyong stroked his neck: "Right, grievances have a source, debts have an owner. Today, we just beat him up and smeared him with dung. It's too cheap for him!" My father said: "Too cheap for him? If the east doesn't shine, the west will shine, an old sow can't escape the butcher's knife!" Everyone laughed again. As they spoke, they walked, and when they reached the crossroads, everyone parted ways. We got home around midnight, and the moon was twenty days old, high in the treetops.

    郭大肚子
    崔八娃
    周围几十里路，提起郭大肚子，人们便恨出油来。老远望去，灰楚楚的一片瓦房就是他家。我不晓得他有多少田地，只听老人家常说：走天把半天莫想出人家的地边。他儿子在公上办事，兄弟当保队副，有钱有势谁敢惹他。
    “人没死把心给烂了。”郭大肚子就是这样一个家伙。他穿着那件油脂麻花的褂子，两手抱着肚子，装扮个可怜相，在人群里混过来混过去。要赶上青黄不接，或是有些事求到他跟前，他马上脚一跺，眉一皱：“哎，为啥不早说呢？用啥东西只要咱有，尽管吭气嘛！”倒把你埋怨一顿。其实，用了他的东西，就算倒了霉啦，铁算盘一拨拉，大加五，荞麦棱子利——分毫不得脱。哼！周围的佃户谁不是叫他这么拨拉干的！
    有一回，大年头上还不起他的账，爹找他去说情。他歪倒床上嘶—嘶嘶地正烧大烟。拧起脖子喝了口茶，眯?着眼半天没言传。忽然他一团坐起来笑眯眯地说：“嘻嘻，这没啥，你请坐一下！”说着把袖一甩溜出去了。再不见面。停会儿狗腿子进来了，二话没说，逼着要账。末后把我家那一亩坟地给了他算完。郭大肚子就是这么个杀人不见血，冰糖嘴刀子心的家伙。
    有一年六月间他修盖房子，门前的“唐将班子”他不雇，到远方找来两班匠人。我们都有些摸不透，他又要捣啥鬼呀？
    正是三伏天，日头贴到背上晒。蹲到树凉里都止不住地淌汗。上百匠人顶着日头，把脊梁晒得紫红紫红地给他干活。郭大肚子穿着半截绸褂褂，裤子结到肚脐下，手里摇着蒲扇，东边瞅瞅，西边望望。“咯吱”一声躺到葡萄架底下藤椅上对匠人说：“这是包活路，鼓劲干嘛！一天干完也拿那么多钱！”背地里却给这个班子几包纸烟，那个班子几包纸烟。他说：“快拿起！快拿起！”生怕别人看见似的。“虽说是个包活路，我看你们这班人干得真有劲，又快又好。”用手捻着他那两根干黄干黄的茅草胡子说：“我这人就是喜欢干脆，痛快。我是最好朋友的人哪！日子长了你们就会知道。哈哈！…”这些匠人没好久和我们混得挺熟，也都知道他兄弟当保队副，他是快刀切豆腐——两面光的坏蛋。说也怪，这两班匠人和神仙一样，搬砖的，合泥的，两个多月的活路，个半月就搞起了。完工的那一天，郭大肚子特别高兴，两眼笑成一条线，里里外外忙的不得闲；手里提把酒壶，嘴里不停地说：“哎呀！你们真能干呀！这回可叫你们把钱挣扎啦！”
    匠人们互相望望，举起酒杯看着新盖的房子，也嘻嘻哈哈地笑了。
    才撂下饭碗，天就变了。一道闪，一阵雷。没多会瓢泼似的大雨下起来了。东一阵，西一阵，南一阵，北一阵。风搅着雨，雨随着风，撒包谷一样唰啦唰啦响得怕人。大概有半夜，我睡得迷迷糊糊的，外面狗咬得厉害。雨还是哗哗地落着，影影绰绰地听到郭大肚子院里吵吵嚷嚷地，也不知道发生了什么事情。
    第二天清早天晴了，我开门一看，咦，原来郭大肚子的院墙垮了一大道。我走到院巴坎上一望，见坎底下围了几个人，有陈茂永、王老五，他们咕咕哝哝地正说悄悄话。我穿好衣裳也凑过去，听说是昨天夜里出了事情，乡丁把郭大肚子家的匠人拉去两三个抵了壮丁。匠人们也把乡丁打坏了七八个。天明连影都不见，不知道那两班匠人那里去了。正说得带劲，陈茂永把嘴一?，人全散了。我一回头，噢，郭大肚子提着文明棍晃过来了。他气呼呼自言自语地说：“……一帮子混饭吃的。给我做这纸扎活路！哼！”一上院巴坎，他望到我们，一楞，朝着王老五说：“看，这是啥世道，随便抓起我的匠人来啦。乡长也得讲个理嘛！”翘起嘴巴望到我们。半天没人答理他。他屁股一掉，“哼——”从鼻子里哼了一声，嘟嘟哝哝地爬过梁子去了。王老五向陈茂永看了一眼，朝郭大肚子“呸”，狠狠地吐了一口唾沫：“别他妈披着骆驼皮装象啦，你撅尾巴我就知道你屙啥屎，他妈伤天害理的事都叫你做绝了。盖房子想不出工钱，哼，还想倒打一耙，这还不是和他兄弟捣的鬼！你去骗鬼吧！”陈茂永把郭大肚子的院墙一指：“看，他这回把算盘也打错了，狗腿子乡丁也没吃了好果子……”“算啦，心里明白比啥都强；‘点上高粱不收荞麦’，咱们也该上坎啦。”说完人们都走了。
    日子过的真快，过了有个把月，人们早不谈这回事了。这天我和爹在锄草，天刚黑回到家里，爹端了盆水在院巴坎上洗脚。猛的听到山梁上响了一枪，把我吓了一怔。我说：“怕是有人来抢郭大肚子吧？”爹一把堵住我的嘴：“可不敢胡说，叫别人听到又是不得了。”话刚收尾，“砰！砰！”又是两枪，震的石崖沙沙地响。以后啥都听不见了。停了有吸袋烟的工夫，后坎上像是陈茂永的声气在喊：“老崔！老崔！快来呀！郭大肚子家出了事啦！”爹把烟紧紧叭了两口往地下一磕，笑眯眯地说：“老实话，郭大肚子出了事啦！”站起来把烟袋朝腰里一插，“走！咱们去看看吧！走！”我跟爹就走到郭大肚子这边来了。
    进院不见人，没点动静。到后院一股臭气扑鼻。正在纳闷，听陈茂永在西边喊：“老崔！快来！这里像有人哼哼。”我拿草把点了个亮，走到葡萄架底下一照，嘿，好家伙啊！桑树上吊着一个人，身上血糊淋淋，嘴里塞着一堆棉花，哼哼唧唧地。把亮举高一看，遍地是粪，没插脚的地方。末后照着他明铮铮的脑壳，我明白是郭大肚子。陈茂永慢吞吞地，走过去把他解下来。他像才杀的猪一样软瘫在地上。
    “嘘——”长出了口气。爹问他：“这是怎么搞的嘛？”停了半天，郭大肚子才把他那肉头摆了两摆，哭丧着脸，上气不接下气地说：“唉，我只当是拉丁的，走到院巴……坎上，我问了一声，他们说……是‘班上的’，前面两个人有些面熟……话没说完，扑上来……堵住我的嘴，按倒就打……哎唷……”王老五在东墙根又嚷了：“喂，他家人在这里，都躲在红薯窖里了。”他老婆爬出红薯窖，甩掉孩子，“格登格登”就朝屋里跑。嘴里干叫：“我的天哪！这叫我怎么过呀！我的钱这下可完啦！”郭大肚子“卟”的一口吐出嘴里的白沫，颤颤抖抖地欠起身子骂道：“你……钱……你个臊婆娘……钱是你爹！我被打得……哎唷—我该死—哎唷—”身子一挺又倒下了。他老婆好像没听见一样，还是往屋里跑，点了灯一照，箱子柜子，原封未动，衣服钱物一件没少，就是两支枪不见了。他老婆这才把心放了一半，抽抽噎噎地走过来，一边擦郭大肚子身上的粪一边嘟哝着：“唉，我们祖上哪一辈造下了孽？我们从来没得罪过人哪！”“就是嘛！你们得罪过谁呢！谁不知道你们是最好朋友的人哪！”王老五两手在胸前一操，嘴皮绷得紧紧的，斜楞着眼瞅着郭大肚子。王老五这一说，可把大家逗得蹩不住要笑，只听得陈茂永“卟嗤”一声，我们就走开了。
    走了多远大家才放声笑起来。我爹说：“今个是‘孟姜女配刘海——有哭有笑’。”陈茂永把王老五一拍：“老五！你真会看碴口，把他老底子都挖出来了，他那一壶不开你掂这一壶。”王老五头一摆，扯起嗓子：“那是好的，我还没说——”他摇头晃脑抱起肚子，叉开八字脚：“‘我这人心里就是喜欢干脆，痛快’。”说得大伙又笑起来了。“喂！”陈茂永一手拉住我爹，一手扯住王老五悄悄地说：“伙计！你没听见他说：有两个人他挺面熟，是不是被抓的那班匠人又回来了呢？”我爹说：“或许是。要是的话，就是被抓的那几个匠人带枪跑回来了，要不哪里来的枪呢？”王老五没等说完，插进来：“屁—他妈的‘一摊狗屎臭三村’，周围几十里路谁没受过他的害！这还不是秃子头上的虱子明摆着嘛，不要说匠人，连我都想剥他的皮！”陈茂永把脖子一摸：“对，冤有头，债有主，今个光揍他一顿，泼他身屎倒便宜了他！”我爹说：“便宜了他？东方不亮，西方亮，老母猪到老少不了一刀敲！”逗得大伙又是一场大笑。边说边走，走到三岔路大伙就分手了。我们回到家大概有半夜，二十头的月亮有树梢高了。
