In order to meet the needs of the country in cultivating talent for construction, the Central People's Government Ministry of Education has carefully studied and referred to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to complete the revision of the secondary school teaching plan (draft), and has issued it to secondary schools across the country for trial implementation starting in August. The revised teaching plan (draft) makes relatively reasonable adjustments to the subject settings and teaching hours in the secondary school teaching plan (draft) issued in 1951: (1) In mathematics, analytic geometry belonging to the scope of university teaching has been removed, and the teaching hours of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry have been increased; (2) Human anatomy and physiology (formerly known as physiology and hygiene) in biology will be taught in the first year of senior high school, the basics of Darwinism will be taught in the second year of senior high school, and plants and animals will each be taught over a year and a half (with a slight increase in teaching hours), and a subject of general hygiene knowledge will be added in the first year of junior high school; (3) The subject of chemistry will be taught from the third year of junior high school, and the teaching hours will also be appropriately reduced according to the actual situation; (4) In order to avoid repetition in history teaching, Chinese history and world history in junior high school history classes have been changed to ancient world history and ancient Chinese history, while senior high school history classes remain modern world history and modern Chinese history, so that students can achieve a reasonable proportion of knowledge in ancient and modern history; (5) The current affairs and policies subject, which was very difficult to teach, has been removed from the political classes, and instead, current affairs reports will be given at weekly meetings, while the teaching hours of general knowledge of the Chinese revolution and the Common Program have been increased. In addition, the teaching hours of language, physics, and geography have also been slightly changed. After the adjustment of various courses, the course load in each grade is lighter than before.
To avoid causing confusion in teaching during the trial period, the Central People's Government Ministry of Education has formulated the "Adjustment Measures for the Trial Implementation of the Secondary School Teaching Plan (Revised Draft) from August 1953 to July 1954," which clearly stipulates the subjects that must be adjusted and the adjustment methods in the first year of trial implementation.

    中央教育部颁发中学教学计划修订草案
    中央人民政府教育部为了适应国家培养建设人材的要求，经过慎重研究并参照苏联先进经验已完成中学教学计划（草案）的修订工作，并颁发给全国中学自八月起试行。修订的教学计划（草案）对一九五一年颁发的中学教学计划（草案）中关于学科的设置和授课时数，作了比较合理的调整：（一）在数学中撤销了属于高等学校教学范围的解析几何，增加了算术、代数、几何和三角的授课时数；（二）生物学中的人体解剖生理学（原名生理卫生）改在高中一年级讲授，达尔文主义基础改在高中二年级讲授，植物和动物各改为一年半时间教完（授课时数稍有增加），并在初中一年级增设卫生常识一科；（三）化学一科改从初中三年级起讲授，授课时数也根据实际情况酌量减少；（四）为免除历史教学的前后重复，把初中历史课中的中国史和世界史改为世界古代史和中国古代史，高中历史课仍为世界近代史和中国近代史，学生的古代史知识与近代史知识也能达到合理的比例；（五）政治课中取销了教学很感困难的时事政策一科，改为在周会上作时事报告，同时增加了中国革命常识和共同纲领的授课时数。此外，语文，物理，地理三科的授课时数也略有变动。各种课程在调整后，各年级的课程分量较前减轻。
    为了避免试行期间引起教学上的混乱，中央人民政府教育部制定了“一九五三年八月至一九五四年七月试行中学教学计划（修定草案）的调整办法”，对试行的第一年度中必须调整的学科和调整办法，都作了明确规定。（新华社）
