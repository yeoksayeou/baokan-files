    The Situation of Fulfilling Plans by State-Owned and Local State-Owned Factories in Shenyang City Has Significantly Improved
    Ninety-five state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang City have overfulfilled their plans for the first half of the year. Among them, Mechanical Factory No. 1, Mechanical Factory No. 2, Mechanical Factory No. 3, Mechanical Factory No. 25, Electrical Factory No. 8, Electrical Factory No. 9, Shenyang Municipal Plumbing Equipment Factory No. 2, Shenyang Municipal Refractory Materials Factory, and fifty-one other factories exceeded their original plans by about 10% to 50%. The production situation of many factories is gradually improving. According to statistics from thirty-five factories, thirteen factories did not complete the planned total output value and product variety in January, which decreased to ten factories in February and March, nine factories in April and May, and six factories in June.
    In the first half of the year, after heatedly discussing the national plan, the city's workers launched patriotic labor competitions and strengthened planning management. In the competition, the city's workers found more than 20,000 tips around solving key production problems and vigorously promoted advanced experiences. For example, the "lost-mold casting method" and "stage division of labor system" and other advanced experiences have been promoted in the foundry workshops of mechanical factories; The Keleisov new turning tool method has been promoted in the processing workshops, which has increased production efficiency by two to nine times. Factories have gradually strengthened planning management, and the production balance rate has increased month by month. Taking thirty-five major factories as an example, twenty-one factories could comprehensively and evenly complete the production plan in January, twenty-two factories in February and March, and twenty-five factories in June.

    Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine Officially Goes into Production
    Exceeded Coal Production Plan in the First Ten Days
    The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, which officially went into production on "July 1st," exceeded its ten-day plan by 7.4% in coal production.
    After the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine was handed over to production, the workers launched a labor competition to overfulfill the national production plan. Zhao Ziyang, the veteran driver of the No. 43 electric shovel in the stripping section, and the workers of the No. 22 electric shovel became more motivated after the challenge. He learned the advanced experience of segmented coal mining, which shortened the time for each row of cars from 70 minutes to 60 minutes, and also ensured the quality of the coal. The workers in the transportation section strengthened the locomotive "daily inspection system" and eliminated the failure of self-tipping trucks not being in place. The staff of the dispatching room maintained close contact with various types of work, achieving flexible vehicle allocation without interfering with each other's work. The staff of the coal storage section shortened the car sweeping time for each row of locomotives from 30 minutes to 25 minutes due to prior preparations. The leaders of the open-pit mine paid attention to checking the implementation of the daily plan and discovered and solved problems in a timely manner. In order to transport the coal out in a timely manner, Haizhou Open-Pit Mine signed contact contracts with more than a dozen units, including the Transportation Department of Fuxin Mining Bureau, the Finance Department, and the West Fuxin Railway Sub-bureau, and established a joint coal mining operation group to ensure the normal production of the open-pit mine. Now, the workers of the open-pit mine have put forward the slogan "Don't waste a minute" and are striving to overfulfill the production plan for the entire month of July.

    The Machine Installation Project of the Largest Automatic Loom Factory in the Southwest
    Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The machine installation project of the new automatic loom factory of the state-owned Chongqing 610 Yarn Factory was completed on July 10th, one month ahead of schedule. A small portion of the automatic looms have already started trial weaving, and it is expected that all automatic looms can be put into operation by October.
    This automatic loom factory is designed according to advanced Soviet experience and equipped with a complete set of machines made in China. It is the largest cloth factory in the Southwest region. The factory has complete labor protection equipment, and the newly installed automatic looms are neatly arranged in the workshop. This kind of automatic loom is very flexible. When one of the more than 2,000 warp yarns rotating on the loom breaks, the machine immediately stops rotating, and the automatic shuttle changer replaces another warp yarn, and then the machine starts rotating again. According to the current trial weaving results of a small part of the automatic looms, the cost of standard oilcloth is low and the quality is good. Therefore, when all the automatic looms in this factory are put into operation, a large number of inexpensive and high-quality cloths will be produced to meet the needs of the people in the Southwest, and the unreasonable phenomenon that Chongqing has long been shipping out cotton yarn and shipping in cotton cloth will be initially changed.

    Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Factory
    Creates "One-Time Rolling Method for Light Rails"
    Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Factory recently successfully tested the method of rolling light rails in one go. This will make a great contribution to supporting national infrastructure construction.
    When Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Factory originally produced light rails, it first rolled steel ingots with a diameter of six inches into steel billets with a diameter of more than three inches, then reheated them in a furnace, and then rolled them into steel rails. The "one-time rolling method" does not require a separate billet opening process, but directly rolls the steel ingot into a steel rail in one go. This greatly shortens the production time of each steel rail, increases production efficiency by 66%, and saves various expenses in the separate billet production process. The factory is preparing to use this method to roll some steel rails in the second half of this year based on its existing equipment conditions. According to statistics, if the factory rolls half of the state-assigned task of steel rails in the second half of this year, it will create an additional 10.1 billion yuan of wealth for the country.
    Light rails are one of the important steel materials needed in national construction. In the second quarter of this year, the light rails produced by the factory were supplied to 49 factories and mining enterprises across the country. Some of these steel rails were transported to the forest areas of Northeast China for laying small railways for transporting harvested timber; some have been transported to the Jixi coal mine in Northeast China, the Fujiatan coal mine in Shanxi, and construction engineering units in Southwest China, East China, Beijing, Qingdao, and other places.

    Fushun Electrical Machinery Factory Uses New Method to Treat Nodular Cast Iron
    The cast iron workshop of Fushun Electrical Machinery Factory, which first successfully tested nodular cast iron in Northeast China, recently succeeded in researching a new method of using pure magnesium for one-time, large-scale, and safe treatment of nodular cast iron. This is of great significance for further exerting the role of nodular cast iron.
    Nodular cast iron is a new type of structural material. Its strength is higher than that of ordinary cast steel, but the production process is shorter than that of ordinary cast iron, the equipment is simpler, and the cost is lower. Since 1951, many factories across the country have successively trial-produced nodular cast iron successfully and gradually applied it to production. However, because the boiling point of magnesium, which is necessary for treating nodular cast iron, is relatively low and the explosiveness is particularly violent, pure magnesium cannot be directly added in large quantities when treating nodular cast iron. It must first be made into an intermediate alloy with a relatively low magnesium content and added to molten iron in several times. This not only increases the consumption of manpower and materials, but also makes it impossible to increase the production of nodular cast iron. The technicians and workers of the cast iron workshop of Fushun Electrical Machinery Factory recently succeeded in researching a method of using pure magnesium for one-time, large-scale treatment of nodular cast iron, which is to coat the pure magnesium with a layer of glass liquid and lead powder, and then add it to the molten iron. This method reduces the heating surface of magnesium in molten iron, prolongs the opportunity and time for molten magnesium to contact molten iron, thereby increasing the recovery rate of magnesium in molten iron and greatly reducing the degree of explosion of magnesium. Pure magnesium can be safely, largely, and directly used for one-time treatment of nodular cast iron. Now, Fushun Electrical Machinery Factory has begun to use this method for production. According to the current production situation, it can save the country 900 million yuan a year in savings alone.

    西南最大的自动布机工厂的
    机器安装工程提前完成
    国营重庆六一零纱厂新建的自动布机工厂的机器安装工程，已在七月十日提前一月完成。目前已有
    一小部分自动布机开始试织，预计到十月间，全部自动布机都可以开动起来。
    这个自动布机工厂是根据苏联先进经验设计的，并为我国自制的全套机器装备起来的西南区最大的
    一个布厂，厂内有完善的劳动保护设备，车间内整齐地排列着刚安装好的自动布机。这种自动布机非常灵巧，当布机上旋转着的两千多根经纱中有一根断头时，机器就立刻停止转动，由自动换梭机换上另一根经纱，然后机器又开始转动起来。根据目前一小部分自动布机的试织结果，所出的标准油布成本低，质量好。因此，当这个厂的全部自动布机开动起来以后，就将生产出大量价廉物美的布匹来供应西南人民的需要，并将初步改变重庆市长期以来运出棉纱、运进棉布的不合理的现象。    （新华社）
    上海钢铁公司第三厂
    创造“轻便钢轨一次轧成法”
    上海钢铁公司第三厂最近试验把轻便钢轨一次轧成的方法成功。这对支援国家基本建设将有很大贡献。
    上海钢铁公司第三厂原来生产轻便钢轨时，是先把直径六吋的钢锭轧成直径三吋多的钢坯后，再回炉重烧，然后轧成钢轨。“一次轧成法”不需要经过单独开坯的过程，直接把钢锭一次轧成为钢轨。这就大大缩短了每根钢轨的生产时间，生产效率提高了百分之六十六，并节省了单独开坯生产过程中的各种费用。该厂根据原有的设备条件，准备在今年下半年开始采用这个办法轧制部分钢轨。据统计，今年下半年该厂如以轧制国家规定任务的一半钢轨计算，就能为国家多创造一百零一亿元的财富。
    轻便钢轨是国家建设中需要的重要钢材之一。今年第二季度，该厂所产轻便钢轨就供应了全国四十九个厂矿企业。这些钢轨有的运往东北森林地区，作为铺设运送开采好的木材的小型铁路之用；有的已运往东北的鸡西、山西的富家滩等煤矿区，以及西南、华东、北京、青岛等地建筑工程单位。

    抚顺机电厂用新法处理球墨铸铁
    在东北试验球墨铸铁首先获得成功的抚顺机电厂铸铁车间，最近又研究用纯镁一次大量安全处理球墨铸铁的新方法成功。这对进一步发挥球墨铸铁的作用很有意义。
    球墨铸铁是一种新型的结构材料，它的强度比一般铸钢高，生产过程却比一般铸铁短，设备也简单，成本低廉。一九五一年以来，全国各地的许多工厂先后试制球墨铸铁成功，并逐步应用到生产上。但因处理球墨铸铁所必须用的镁的沸点比较低，爆炸性特别猛烈，因此在处理球墨铸铁时，不能直接大量地加纯镁，必须先做成含镁量比较低的中间合金，分几次加入铁水。这样，不但增加了人力和材料的消耗，而且使得球墨铸铁的产量不能提高。抚顺机电厂铸铁车间的技术人员和工人，最近研究成功的用纯镁一次大量处理球墨铸铁的方法，就是在纯镁上涂上一层玻璃液加铅粉，然后再加入铁水。这种办法减少了镁在铁水中的受热面，使熔化的镁接触铁水的机会和时间延长，因而提高了镁在铁水里的回收率，大大减弱镁的爆炸程度，可以安全地大量地一次地直接用纯镁处理球墨铸铁。现在，抚顺机电厂已开始用这种方法进行生产，按目前生产情况计算，仅仅在节约方面一年可以为国家节约九亿元。    （新华社）
