    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: According to the "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, the "Matsukawa Incident," fabricated by the Yoshida government to persecute patriotic Japanese people, has entered its final trial stage. The Japanese people nationwide are launching a movement to demand the release of the twenty patriotic fighters who were victimized.
    Throughout the "Matsukawa Incident" trial, the Yoshida government has suppressed the defendants from stating their reasons, implementing a fascist trial, and is scheduled to deliver the final verdict in October. This arrogant trial has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Japanese people. Organizations such as the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, the Japan Teachers' Union, and the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union are protesting, demanding that the twenty victims be declared innocent and released. At its Fourth National Congress, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan unanimously passed a resolution demanding the innocent release of the victims of the "Matsukawa Incident." To date, more than six million people have signed petitions demanding the release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." Many prominent figures, such as former University of Tokyo President Shigeru Nanbara, writer Kazuo Hirotsu, and Councilor Tamayo Miyagi, have signed.
    The movement to demand the release of the victims of the "Matsukawa Incident" has also received support from international workers' organizations. The International Metalworkers' Federation and the International of Seamen, Dockers and Fishermen (Industrial Department of the World Federation of Trade Unions), as well as Indian trade unions, have protested to the Yoshida government, demanding the release of the twenty Japanese patriots.
    The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, published an editorial on July 12, calling on more Japanese people to participate in the struggle to demand the release of the patriotic victims of the "Matsukawa Incident." The editorial pointed out that this struggle is part of the struggle to crush the war-fascist policies of the United States and the Yoshida government.

    “松川事件”进入最后审判阶段
    日本人民展开要求释放爱国志士的运动
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：据“赤旗报”报道，吉田政府所制造的迫害日本爱国人民的“松川事件”已进入最后审判阶段。日本全国人民正在展开要求释放被害的二十名爱国志士的运动。
    吉田政府在“松川事件”的审讯中一直压制被告人陈诉理由，实行法西斯审判，并定于十月最后判决。这种蛮横的审判已激起了日本广大人民的愤怒。日本国营铁道工会、日本教职员工会和日本自治团体工会总联合会等团体都纷纷提出抗议，要求对二十名被害者宣布无罪，予以释放。日本工会总评议会在第四次全国大会上，一致通过要求无罪释放“松川事件”的被害者。到目前为止，已有六百多万人签名要求释放“松川事件”无辜被告。许多知名人士，如前东京大学校长南原繁、作家广津和郎、参议员宫城玉代等都签了名。
    要求释放“松川事件”被害者的运动，也受到了国际工人组织的声援。五金机器工人工会国际和海员、码头与渔业工人工会国际（世界工会联合会产业部）以及印度工会等，都向吉田政府提出抗议，要求释放二十名日本爱国者。
    日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”七月十二日发表社论，号召更多的日本人民参加到要求释放“松川事件”被害的爱国者的斗争中来。社论指出：这个斗争是粉碎美国和吉田政府的战争法西斯政策的斗争的一部分。
