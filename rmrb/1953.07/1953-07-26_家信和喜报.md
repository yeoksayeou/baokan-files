    Family Letters and Good News
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Jiang Qingzhao
    On the Korean front, Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers frequently receive letters from their fathers, mothers, wives, or other family members. These letters, coming from thousands of miles away, not only bring the soldiers the warm care of their loved ones but also news of the ever-changing face of the motherland and the wishes of their families to encourage their sons to "kill the enemy and perform meritorious service." These family letters inspire the soldiers to advance towards even greater victories. The soldiers say: A family letter is a report of good news!
    I interviewed Wang Keze, a third-class merit recipient and an excellent machine gunner. He told me the story of how he became a machine gunner. It turned out that during the Shangganling campaign last year, he was still a young cook. At that time, he received a letter from his family in Sichuan. His older brother, who worked in a power plant, first reported a great piece of good news: a power plant had been built in his hometown. His old father, who had spent forty years of hard work as a hired laborer in the old society, followed up with a letter saying: "Child! Life is getting better and better, and people are getting younger and younger. Last year, our family was allocated a house and land, and this year a bright electric light has been hung in our small thatched house. Next year and the year after, who knows how much better things will be?" Wang Keze couldn't help but shed tears of excitement as he looked at the letter. He clearly remembered how his mother was forced to death by the landlord and had not forgotten the pain of working for the landlord with his father since he was eight years old. In the two years since the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea began, the motherland and his hometown had changed so quickly! He hurriedly ran to the company headquarters and handed the letter to the instructor, requesting that the leadership transfer him from the kitchen to the combat squad.
    He said, "What I see in the family letter is not only the change in one family but also the daily prosperity and strength of our great motherland!"
    On the Kaesong front, I also interviewed Zhang Chuangeng, a young soldier who made his first meritorious service. He is twenty years old this year and an excellent member of the Communist Youth League. Before the start of a battle, he posted a letter and a photo from his family in Shandong Province in his fortifications. The photo showed his smiling old father. The letter contained his father's instructions: "There is no need to say anything about the good times in our family. You will understand seven or eight things when you look at this photo. Good boy! Everything at home is taken care of by Chairman Mao and the villagers. Don't worry about it. I only hope that you can learn from the combat heroes and strive to bring good news home!"
    The battle began, and Zhang Chuangeng and his comrades in the whole class bravely fought fiercely with rows and rows of enemies for a whole day, repelling more than ten enemy charges and killing or wounding more than a hundred enemies. In the evening, Zhang Chuangeng and the deputy squad leader were guarding a position. The deputy squad leader said: "Little Zhang, don't panic, we must hold the position!" "Yes! Deputy Squad Leader!" Little Zhang replied firmly. Then, the eyes of the two men fell on the family letter and the photo.
    At this time, the enemy launched another charge. The deputy squad leader was hit by a bullet in the battle to repel the enemy in front, and only Little Zhang was left on the position. When the enemy charged up from the side, Zhang Chuangeng remembered his father's words: "Learn from the combat heroes and strive to bring good news home." He clenched his grenade and, cooperating with our army's counterattack troops, was the first to rush towards the enemy. The enemy was repelled. The young and brave Zhang Chuangen made his first meritorious service.
    In a heroic infantry company, I also heard such a moving story: This spring, machine gunner Wang Qiang's legs were injured in a fierce battle. Just as everyone was about to send him to the rear for recuperation, he hurriedly took out a letter from his pocket and said excitedly: "Look! This is a letter from the banks of the Huai River, my wife has become a patriotic model worker for high yield! I resolutely cannot go down, I want to compete with her!" He stubbornly refused to leave the front line, lay down in a shell crater close to the enemy, and killed a large number of enemies with hand grenades.
    In the hospital, the instructor personally sent a merit citation to Wang Qiang. This heroic soldier immediately wrote a long letter reporting his meritorious deeds in this battle and sent the merit citation along with it to his wife who was working hard on the banks of the Huai River.
    Every family letter from the great motherland has become a great force to inspire the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers to fight bravely. During the famous Kaesong defense battle, Wang Zenghai, a new soldier of the Sixth Company of the "Great Meritorious Service Regiment" of a certain unit, received a letter from his father, Wang Jinghe. The letter told him: Today, the family not only has surplus food and new clothes, but also uses flashlights to feed the cattle when getting out of bed at night and carries thermos bottles when working in the fields during the day. The letter said: "For the sake of the motherland and the Korean people, you must fight bravely, study hard, and strive to perform meritorious service and become a hero. Otherwise, we will be sorry for Chairman Mao and our fellow villagers!"
    In the forward tunnels, someone read the letter aloud to everyone by candlelight. All the soldiers were greatly moved and inspired. The commanders and fighters of the whole company excitedly swore: "Wang Jinghe is the father of all of us. His happiness is our greatest joy. His instructions are our vows. Our parents taught us to become a soldier loyal to the motherland. Such parents are our pride. In order to protect their happy old age, we must fight more bravely!" With such determination, the Sixth Company excellently completed the combat tasks assigned by the superiors, repelled the enemy's attack, and killed a large number of enemies. The whole company was honorably awarded a collective merit. The young soldier Wang Zenghai was wounded in this battle but did not leave the front line, killing more than ten enemies one after another, and was also awarded a third-class merit.
    Our great motherland and people are educating their children with lofty patriotism and internationalism. The outstanding children of our great motherland - the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers - are repaying their relatives with great and heroic practical actions to defend peace. Thousands of educational family letters are flowing from the motherland to the front line, and countless glorious merit citations are flying from the front line to every glorious city and village in the motherland.

### 家信和喜报

    家信和喜报
    新华社记者  姜庆肇
    在朝鲜前线，中国人民志愿军战士们经常收到他们的父亲、母亲、妻子或者其他家人的来信。这些来自数千里以外的家信，不仅给战士们带来了亲人们温暖的关怀，而且带来了祖国日新月异的面貌和亲人们鼓励自己子弟“杀敌立功”的愿望。这些家信，鼓舞着战士们向更大的胜利前进。战士们说：一封家信，就是一份喜报啊！
    我访问过三等功臣、出色的机枪手王克泽。他告诉我他是怎样当上机枪手的故事。原来去年上甘岭战役时，他还是一个青年炊事员。当时，他收到了来自四川的家信。在发电厂里工作的哥哥首先报告他一件大喜事：家乡的发电厂已经建立起来了。在旧社会里度过了四十年辛酸的雇工生活的老父亲紧接着也来信告诉他：“孩子！日子越过越有盼头，人也越活越年青了。前年我家才分到了房子和田，今年我们这小草房里便挂起明晃晃的电灯来了。明年、后年，还不知道又会变得怎么个好法呢？”王克泽看着信，禁不住激动的眼泪流了下来。他清楚地记得母亲是怎样被地主逼死的，也没有忘记他从八岁就和父亲一起给地主扛活的痛苦。抗美援朝两年多，祖国和家乡的变化是多么快啊！他匆匆地跑到连部把这封家信交给了指导员，请求上级把他从炊事房里调到战斗班去。
    他说：“我从家信上看到的不光是一个家庭的变化，而是我们伟大的祖国在一天天繁荣和富强啊！”
    在开城前线，我还访问了首战立功的青年战士张传庚。他今年二十岁，是个优秀的青年团员。在一次战斗发起之前，他把来自山东省的一封家信和一张像片贴在自己的工事里。像片上是他的满脸笑容的老父亲。信上是父亲的嘱咐：“关于咱家的好光景什么也不必说，你看看这张像片就明白七八了。好孩子！家中的一切都有毛主席和乡亲们照管，你千万不要挂念，只盼望你能向战斗英雄们学习，争取捎个喜报来家呀！”
    战斗开始了，张传庚和全班的战友们英勇地和成连成排的敌人激战了一整天，打垮了敌人十多次冲锋，杀伤了一百多个敌人。傍晚，张传庚和副班长两个人守在一个阵地上。副班长说：“小张，千万不要心慌，咱们一定得守住阵地！”“是！副班长！”小张坚定地回答了他。接着，两个人的眼光就不约而同地盯在那封家信和像片上了。
    这时，敌人又发起了冲锋。副班长在击退正面敌人的战斗中被枪弹打中了，阵地上只剩下了小张一个人。当敌人从侧面往上冲的时候，张传庚想起了父亲的话：“向战斗英雄们学习，争取捎个喜报来家呀。”他紧握着手榴弹配合着我军反击部队，第一个冲向敌人。敌人被打退了。年轻而英勇的张传庚首次立下了战功。
    在一个英雄的步兵连队里，我还听到这样一个动人的故事：今年春天，机枪手王强的两腿在某次激战中负了伤。正当大家要把他送到后方去休养的时候，他却急忙从衣袋里掏出一封家信来激动地说：“你们看！这是我从淮河岸上来的一封家信，我的老婆当上爱国丰产劳动模范啦！我坚决不能下去，我要和她竞赛！”他执拗地不肯离开火线，卧倒在一个接近敌人的炮弹坑里，又用手雷打死了一大批敌人。
    在医院里，指导员亲自把一张立功喜报送给了王强。这位英勇的战士立刻写了一封长信报告自己在这次战斗中的立功事迹，和立功喜报一起寄给了在淮河岸上辛勤劳动的妻子。
    来自伟大祖国的每一封家信都成为鼓舞中国人民志愿军战士英勇战斗的巨大力量。在著名的开城保卫战中，某部“大功团”第六连新战士王增夏接到了父亲王京河寄来的家信。信上告诉他：今天家里人不但吃有余粮，穿有新衣，并且在黑夜下床喂牛时打着手电，白天下地干活时还提着暖壶。信上说：“为了祖国和朝鲜人民，你要勇敢作战，努力学习，争取立功当英雄，不然，我们就对不起毛主席，对不起乡亲们！”
    在前沿坑道里，有人借着烛光向大家宣读了这封信。所有的战士都受到了很大的感动和鼓舞。全连的指挥员、战斗员们激动地宣誓：“王京河是我们大家的父亲，他的幸福，就是我们最大的快乐，他的嘱咐，就是我们的誓言。我们的父母教育我们要成为一位忠于祖国的战士。这样的父母是我们的骄傲。为了保卫他们幸福的晚年，我们要更加勇敢地作战！”就在这样的决心下，第六连出色地完成了上级交下的战斗任务，打退了敌人的进攻并大量地杀伤了敌人。全连光荣地立了一个集体功。年青的战士王增夏在这次战斗中负伤不下火线，先后杀死了十多个敌人，个人还荣立了三等功。
    我们伟大的祖国和人民用崇高的爱国主义和国际主义思想教育着自己的子弟。我们伟大祖国优秀的儿女——中国人民志愿军战士们正以伟大而英勇的保卫和平的实际行动报答着自己的亲人。千万封富有教育意义的家信从祖国流向前线，随之而来的无数封光荣的立功喜报也正从前线飞向祖国每一个光荣的城市和乡村。
