Xinjiang Province's First People's Games Achieve Excellent Results

    Xinjiang Province's First People's Games were held from the 10th to the 16th at People's Square in Dihua City.
    A total of 655 athletes from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang participated in the sports competitions. They came from all over Xinjiang and included workers, farmers, herdsmen, government cadres, students, and People's Liberation Army soldiers. The ethnic composition included Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tatar, Hui, Russian, Mongolian, and Sibe, among others, totaling eleven ethnic groups. The Northwest People's Sports Commission's Sports Propaganda Team also participated in the performances and competitions.
    The competition events included ball games, track and field, tug-of-war, as well as ethnic-style wrestling and rope climbing. The exciting wrestling matches between Kazakh and Uyghur athletes aroused great interest among the audience. The most exciting wrestling matches lasted for one and a half hours. The technical performance of rope climbing by Sidir Asim, a Uyghur from southern Xinjiang, and his two daughters won rounds of applause from the audience.
    The achievements of sports activities carried out by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang over the past three years were fully reflected in this conference. After heated and intense competition, many exciting records emerged. Among them, 13 events in the men's group, including standing long jump, pole vault, shot put, hand grenade throw, 200-meter low hurdles, 400-meter intermediate hurdles, and 400-meter race, and in the women's group, discus, shot put, hand grenade throw, 80-meter low hurdles, 100-meter and 400-meter race, broke the records of the Northwest Regional Sports Games last year. In addition, Baharam (Uzbek) from Ili exceeded the 1952 national record in the 200-meter low hurdles with a time of 28.6 seconds. Li Ying from Dihua City broke the 1952 national record of 1 minute 2.4 seconds in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles with a time of 1 minute 1.5 seconds. Nadida (Tatar) from Dihua City and Maruxia (Russian) from the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company, who participated in the women's hand grenade throw, broke the national record of 39.81 meters last year with 40.70 meters and 40.30 meters respectively. Liao Fuke, a mechanical repair worker from Ili, also broke the Northwest Regional record (66.61 meters) in the men's hand grenade throw with 71.45 meters.

Zhejiang Iron Factory Medical Personnel Accept Rationalization Proposals to Improve the Medical System

    The medical personnel of Zhejiang Iron Factory accepted the rationalization proposals of the workers to improve the medical system, so that the sick workers could get timely treatment and save production time.
    The new system is to implement surgical rounds, internal medicine appointment registration, and special drug delivery. According to this method, in terms of surgical treatment, several surgical medical personnel push a medical vehicle equipped with necessary medicines and equipment into the workshops in turn from 9:00 to 10:00 every morning to conduct rounds. In terms of internal medicine treatment, sick workers register their condition in a clinic appointment registration book in the workshop before work every day, and then the health clinic allocates manpower and arranges the time for each patient to see a doctor according to the severity of the condition, and assigns someone to distribute bamboo sticks with the diagnosis time noted to the patients in each workshop. In this way, workers can go to the clinic at the prescribed time without delaying production time. Medicines are also delivered directly to the workers in the workshop by a special drug delivery person, without having to wait in the pharmacy. This method has been effective since it was implemented in February this year. In the past, workers often spent one or two hours of production time waiting for registration, diagnosis, and medicine distribution, but this phenomenon no longer exists. The workers are very satisfied, and the medical personnel also feel that the work is active and planned.

Zhang Xihua, Director of the Ophthalmology Department of the Fourth People's Hospital in Xi'an, Successfully Experiments with "Corneal Transplantation"

    Zhang Xihua, director of the ophthalmology department of the Fourth People's Hospital in Xi'an, successfully experimented with "corneal transplantation" by learning advanced Soviet medical technology. Of the eight completely blind patients treated by Zhang Xihua with this operation, six have now had their eyes restored to sight, and two are recovering.
    "Corneal transplantation" is a major contribution by Stalin Prize winner, Soviet Socialist Labor Hero, Honored Scientist, Academician of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, Filatov, to patients around the world who are blinded by leukomas. Corneal transplantation is to remove the leukoma on the black eyeball caused by disease and replace it with a piece of dead person's cornea. According to Zhang Xihua's experience, the dead person's cornea used for "corneal transplantation" is best taken, used, and applied immediately after death. If it cannot be taken and used in time, it can only be stored in the refrigerator for up to ten hours, after which it will become invalid.
    Zhang Xihua began trying "corneal transplantation" in February this year. The eyes of the first patient, Cai Jicai, who was treated with this operation, were restored to sight. Now, according to the results of the examination of the six patients who have been discharged from the hospital, three have had their vision restored to 6/60 (what a normal person can see at a distance of 60 meters, they can see at a distance of 6 meters), two have recovered to 3/60, and one has the best recovery, with vision reaching 36/60. They were all hospitalized for more than a month.

Nanjing People's Gulou Hospital Studies Advanced Soviet Medical Experience and Achieves Good Results with "Blocking Therapy"

    Nanjing People's Gulou Hospital studied advanced Soviet medical experience and achieved good results with "blocking therapy."
    "Blocking therapy" applies Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity, injecting the local anesthetic "Procaine" around the diseased tissue to block the pathological impulses from the lesion site from being transmitted to the nerve center. Nanjing People's Gulou Hospital tried "blocking therapy" on more than 120 patients in three months. The results of the treatment showed that 50% had special effects and significant progress, 27% had progress in their condition, 11% were ineffective, and 12% were still under observation due to loss of contact with the patients or were in the observation period, and the results are still unknown.
    The surgery department of Nanjing People's Gulou Hospital used this advanced therapy to cure many diseases that were previously considered difficult to cure in the short term. For example, Li Jingren, a student from a middle school in Bengbu, had frostbite on both feet, swelling and pain, and difficulty walking. After four "blocking therapy" treatments, he was cured. Xu Shaoyi, a nurse at Nanjing People's Gulou Hospital, suffered from acute mastitis, with redness, swelling, and pain in her breasts. After one "blocking therapy" treatment, the swelling and pain completely disappeared. Wang Liwen, a staff member of the hospital, suffered from a carbuncle on his back (commonly known as "dabei"), which was cured after two treatments with a mixture of "Procaine" local anesthetic and penicillin "blocking therapy." The thromboangiitis obliterans disease, which surgeons used to find most difficult to treat, is also very effective with "blocking therapy." Duan Wenjin, a boatman from Dongpaotai, Nanjing, suffered from thromboangiitis obliterans and was restless at night. After one "blocking therapy" treatment, he was able to sleep, and he was completely cured after five treatments. "Blocking therapy" is also very effective for "snake bites," which doctors used to consider difficult to treat. The hospital recently successfully treated four "snake bite" patients in a row. In order to further study and promote "blocking therapy," the hospital has established a "blocking therapy" team.

    三年来新疆各族人民开展体育运动的成就，充分反映在这次大会上。经过热烈、紧张的比赛。出现了许多令人兴奋的纪录。其中男子组的急行跳远、撑竿跳高、铅球、手榴弹掷远、二百公尺低栏、四百公尺中栏、四百公尺赛跑和女子组的铁饼、铅球、手榴弹掷远、八十公尺低栏、一百公尺和四百公尺赛跑等十三项，打破了去年西北区体育运动会的纪录。而伊犁选手巴哈拉木（乌兹别克族）的二百公尺低栏以二十八秒六超过了一九五二年全国最高纪录。迪化市选手李英的四百公尺中栏以一分一秒五打破一九五二年一分二点四秒的全国纪录，参加女子组手榴弹掷远的迪化市选手娜迪达（塔塔尔族）和中苏石油股份公司选手玛露霞（俄罗斯族），各以四零点七零公尺和四零点三零公尺打破去年三九点八一公尺的全国纪录。伊犁的机械修理工人料付克参加男子组手榴弹掷远，也以七一点四五公尺突破去年西北区纪录（六六点六一公尺）。
    浙江铁工厂医务人员接受合理化建议改进
    医疗制度
    浙江铁工厂的医务人员接受职工的合理化建议，改进医疗制度，使患病职工得到及时的治疗并节省了生产时间。
    这种新制度就是实行外科巡回治疗、内科预约登记和专人送药。按照这一方法在外科治疗方面，每天上午九点到十点有几个外科医务人员推着一辆备有必需药品和用具的医疗车依次深入各车间，进行巡回治疗。在内科治疗方面，有病的工人每天在上班前将自己的病情在车间的一本门诊预约登记簿上登记，然后由保健室根据病情的轻重缓急配备力量和安排每个病人的看病时间，并派人将注有诊断时间的竹签分发给各车间患者。这样工人们就可以依照规定的时间前去诊治，不耽误生产时间。药品也由专门送药的人直接给工人们送到车间，用不着在药房那里等。这一办法自今年二月实施以来，已有显著成效。过去工人们因等挂号等诊治等配药往往花掉一两小时的生产时间，现在这种现象没有了。职工们都很满意，医务人员也感到工作主动和有计划了。
    西安市第四人民医院眼科主任
    张锡华试验“角膜移植术”成功
    西安市第四人民医院眼科主任张锡华，学习苏联先进医学技术试验“角膜移植术”成功。经张锡华施用这种手术医治的八个完全失明的病人，现在已有六人的眼睛恢复了光明，二人正在痊愈中。
    “角膜移植术”是斯大林奖金获得者、苏联社会主义劳动英雄、功勋科学家、乌克兰科学院及苏联医药科学院院士费拉托夫给全世界因白斑而失明的病人的重大贡献。角膜移植就是把黑眼珠上因病而生的白斑取掉，换上一块死人的眼角膜。根据张锡华的经验，施行“角膜移植术”所用的死人眼角膜，最好是随死、随取、随用，如果不能适时取用，至多也只能在冰箱内保存十小时，超过这个时间就会失效。
    张锡华试用“角膜移植术”治疗是在今年二月开始的。经过这种手术治疗的第一个病人蔡吉才眼睛就恢复了光明。现在根据已经先后出院的六个病人检查的结果，有三个人的视力恢复到六十分之六
    （正常人在距离六十公尺远的地方可以看见的东西，他们在距离六公尺的地方可以看见），有两个人恢复到六十分之三，有一人恢复的情况最好，视力达到六十分之三十六。他们住院医疗时间都是一个多月。
    南京人民鼓楼医院学习苏联先进医学经验
    试用封闭疗法效果很好
    南京人民鼓楼医院学习苏联先进医学经验，试用“封闭疗法”效果很好。
    “封闭疗法”是应用巴夫洛夫的高级神经活动学说，将局部麻醉剂“普鲁卡因”注射在病变组织的周围，阻止病灶部的病理冲动传导到神经中枢去。南京人民鼓楼医院试用“封闭疗法”，在三个月内，对一百二十多病人试行医疗的结果，有特效和显著进步的占百分之五十，病情有进步的占百分之二十七，无效的占百分之十一，还有百分之十二，因和患者失去联系或是正在观察时期，还不知结果。
    南京人民鼓楼医院外科试用这种先进疗法，治好了许多过去认为短期内不易治好的疾病：如蚌埠某中学学生李敬仁因两足冻伤，肿胀疼痛，行走十分困难，经过四次“封闭疗法”后已经痊愈。南京人民鼓楼医院护士徐绍义患急性乳腺炎，乳房红肿疼痛，经过一次“封闭疗法”，肿痛就完全消失。该院职员王礼文患背部痈（俗称搭背）经用“普鲁卡因”局部麻醉剂和配尼西林混合“封闭疗法”二次就痊愈了。过去外科医生治疗上最感困难的栓塞性脉管炎病，应用“封闭疗法”也很有效：南京东炮台的船户段文锦患栓塞性脉管炎夜晚痛苦不安，经
    “封闭疗法”一次，就能睡觉，医疗五次就完全痊愈。“封闭疗法”对过去医生认为难治的“蛇咬伤”也有特效，该院最近连续治疗了四个“蛇咬伤”患者都很成功。该院为了进一步研究和推行“封闭疗法”，已成立“封闭疗法”小组。
