	Cultural and Artistic Work in the Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region Develops
	Cultural and artistic work in the Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region is developing. Currently, every county in the region has established cultural centers (stations) and radio stations, and some districts and townships have also prioritized the establishment of these institutions. Various localities throughout the region have organized a number of mass amateur theater troupes; in the Yishan Special District alone, there are 460 amateur theater troupes. In addition to maintaining popular books for the masses to read, local cultural centers often send people deep into remote mountainous areas with slides and pictures for mobile screenings and exhibitions. Professional and amateur theater troupes from various regions also frequently go to the countryside to perform, with performance types including Cantonese opera, Kwangsi opera, Yong opera, and folk dramas such as tea-picking opera and melody opera. In addition to historical stories, the content of the dramas includes many adaptations and newly written works. People of all ethnic groups greatly enjoy these dramas. For example, in the Yishan Special District, 21 literary and art work groups (teams) performed more than 300 dramas in a single month, with an audience of over 400,000 people.
	Tianjin Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology Established
	The Tianjin Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology was formally established on July 5th. The Tianjin Preparatory Committee for the Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology was established in March 1951. Over the past two years, the preparatory committee has developed more than 1,000 members, established specialized committees for science, engineering, and medicine, as well as 22 working groups, and conducted more than 860 science lectures, science exhibitions, and slide screenings. After its official establishment, the Tianjin Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology will more extensively mobilize the city's scientific and technological workers to carry out systematic scientific and technological publicity work among workers and cadres.
