Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 10th (TASS): *Pravda*'s London correspondent, V. Mayevsky, comments on British newspapers' remarks regarding Anglo-American differences.

Mayevsky writes: The reasons for the sharpening of Anglo-American contradictions are no longer a secret. For a long time, American monopoly capital has adopted a policy of continuously weakening Britain's economic and political position, squeezing out British monopoly capital within the British Empire.

The competition between Britain and the United States on the economic front is particularly fierce. Mayevsky said: Last year, Britain's trade deficit with the United States totaled 135 million pounds, and there was a large deficit in the first quarter of this year.

Huge military appropriations and increasingly fierce competition in the capitalist world market have created enormous economic difficulties for Britain and the entire Sterling Area. The threat of large-scale unemployment in some British industrial sectors is increasing day by day.

The majority of the British public now increasingly understands that in response to Britain's proposed principle of "trade, not aid," the United States actually insists on the principle of "neither trade nor aid." The *Daily Express*, when discussing the US reduction of "aid" to Britain, said: The days of dollar "aid" are not long. Britain should not remain inactive before the US Congress closes its purse. The newspaper pointed out that Britain must show that from now on, Britain will think of its own ways and not rely on American aid.

Mayevsky continued that while discussing the development of trade and resources within the British Empire to reduce the economic difficulties of the Sterling Area, the British public firmly demanded the restoration of normal economic relations between East and West, and increasingly resolutely demanded an end to the Korean War launched by the American aggressors.

The British ruling circles are worried about the actions of the United States in the Near and Middle East, where American diplomacy continues to pursue a policy of weakening British influence.

In Western Europe, Anglo-American political differences are also obvious. American newspapers have repeatedly said that Britain's "cautious" policy on the notorious "European Defense Community" is one of the reasons why the Paris Treaty has not been ratified to this day. The United States is somewhat agitated at the mention of Britain's unwillingness to participate in the European Coal and Steel Community. Britain opposes the establishment of a so-called "European Federation," which Washington insists on. Although many British bourgeois newspapers support the organizers of the fascist provocations in Berlin, more far-sighted British observers have to point out that the policy of American extremists on the German question will bring serious consequences. Even publications like *The Economist* have to admit that American policy is increasingly unpopular because it is considered too inflexible, too conservative, and too inhumane.

British newspapers have pointed out the increasing demand in Western Europe for great power consultation to resolve unresolved and major issues. The British government and the opposition party, many political parties, and spokespersons in the press have expressed support for four-power consultation. The vast majority of the British people believe that consultation is a way out of the dead end. However, holding consultations is something that frightens those Americans because they oppose easing international tensions and stopping the "Cold War." The enemies of peace are afraid of such consultations.

Mayevsky concluded by writing that without a doubt, at the Anglo-American-French Foreign Ministers' Conference that began in Washington on July 10, the United States will try to exert greater pressure on its partners. However, it can already be said that the Washington conference will not ease the sharp contradictions in the Anglo-American bloc, because it cannot eliminate the reasons that are making these contradictions even more acute.

    “真理报”记者就英国报纸关于英美分歧的言论发表评论
    英美之间的经济矛盾和政治分歧越来越深
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：真理报驻伦敦记者维·马耶夫斯基就英国报纸关于英美分歧的言论发表评论。
    马耶夫斯基写道：英美矛盾尖锐化的原因已经不是秘密。美国垄断资本长时期以来，便采取了不断削弱英国经济与政治地位的政策，它们在英帝国范围内排挤英国垄断资本。
    英美在经济战线上的竞争尤其激烈。马耶夫斯基说：去年英国对美国的贸易逆差总额达一亿三千五百万英镑之多，今年第一季又有很大的逆差。
    庞大的军事拨款与资本主义世界市场日益强烈的竞争，使英国和整个英镑区都遇到巨大的经济困难。一些英国工业部门中大规模失业的威胁在一天天增加。
    大多数的英国公众现在越来越明白：为了答覆英国所提出的“要贸易不要援助”的原则，美国实际上坚持着“既不贸易又不援助”的原则。“每日快报”谈到美国削减对英国的“援助”时说：美元“援助”的日子没有多久了。在美国国会关上皮包以前，英国不应无所举动。该报指出：英国必须表明：从今以后，英国将想它们自己的办法而不依靠美援。
    马耶夫斯基继续说，在讨论发展英帝国内部的贸易和资源以减少英镑区的经济困难的同时，英国公众坚决要求恢复东西方之间的正常经济关系，并日益坚决地要求停止美国侵略者所发起的朝鲜战争。
    英国统治集团对于美国在近中东的作为表示忧虑，美国在那里的外交仍然追随着削弱英国势力的政策。
    在西欧，英美的政治分歧也很明显。美国报纸不止一次地说过，英国在臭名昭著的“欧洲防务集团”问题上的“谨慎”政策，是巴黎条约迟至今日未获批准的原因之一。美国一提到英国不愿参加欧洲煤钢联营就有些激动。英国反对成立所谓“欧洲联邦”，而这是华盛顿所坚持要求的。虽然许多英国资产阶级报纸袒护柏林法西斯挑衅的组织者，然而比较有远见的英国观察家却不得不指出，美国极端主义分子在德国问题上的政策将带来严重的后果。甚至像“经济学家”这样的刊物也不得不承认：美国的政策越来越没有人支持了，因为大家认为它太不灵活、太保守、太不近人情。
    英国报纸指出了西欧争取大国协商以解决争执未决的和主要的问题的日益强烈的要求。英国政府和在野党、许多政治党派和报界的发言人都已表示赞成四国协商。绝大多数的英国人民都认为，协商是走出死胡同的一条道路。然而举行协商是使那些美国人害怕的事情，因为他们反对缓和国际紧张局势和停止“冷战”。和平的敌人害怕这种协商。
    马耶夫斯基最后写道：毫无疑问，在七月十日在华盛顿开始的美英法三国外长会议上，美国将设法对他的同伴施以更大的压力。但是，现在已经可以说：华盛顿会议是不会缓和英美集团中的尖锐矛盾的，因为它不能消除使这些矛盾更加尖锐的原因。
