	Principal of Xifa Village Elementary School in Liuhe County Should Not Force Students to Suspend Classes to Build Toilets

	A letter from Mu Ren, District One, Liuhe County, Liaodong Province: Ma Quanxing, principal of the central elementary school in Xifa Village, my district, required all elementary school students to stop attending classes every afternoon from June 10th to June 20th to build eleven large toilets with surrounding walls. This matter has caused dissatisfaction among students and parents. On June 17th, some students said, "You only tell us to work, not to study. I'm not going!" Ma Quanxing was furious when he heard this and immediately called a meeting of all the students, ordering each class to discuss how to ensure the completion of the construction task; and said that the class that failed to complete it would be held responsible by the grade teacher. Some elementary school students were overworked during work, and some broke their hands and feet, but he did not care about them at all. The teachers suggested that the toilets could be built gradually and should not take up class time, affecting students' learning. He ignored it. He also used the name of "loving the school" to let students bring materials for building toilets from home. All students brought a total of eighty-three bundles of rice straw, one hundred and four bundles of sorghum stalks, and some nails, hemp, iron wire, etc.; many parents had a lot of opinions. Ma Quanxing's behavior of disregarding students' learning and health and arbitrarily mobilizing students to donate things is wrong. He should make a profound self-criticism.

    柳河县新发村小学校长不应强迫学生停课盖厕所
    辽东省柳河县一区木人来信：我区新发村中心小学校长马权兴要全校小学生在六月十日到六月二十日每天下午不上课，去修建十一间有围墙的大厕所。这件事引起学生和家长的不满。六月十七日，有的学生说：“光叫干活，不让学习，我不去！”马权兴听到后大发雷霆，立即召集全体学生讲话，并命令各班回去讨论怎样保证完成修建任务；并说那班完不成要由级任老师负责。小学生们在干活时有的劳累过度，有的弄破手脚，他也毫不关心。教师们提出：厕所可以逐步修，不应占用上课时间，影响学生的学习。他也置之不理。他并以“爱校”的名义让学生从家里拿修建厕所用的材料来，全校学生共拿稻草八十三捆、秫秸一百零四捆及一部分钉子、麻、铁线等；不少家长很有意见。马权兴这种不顾学生学习和健康并随便动员学生捐东西的行为是不对的。他应该作深刻的检讨。
