Marxism-Leninism Unites Us

"The Chinese people are geographically far from us, but in thought and feeling, they are very close to us, like a family."

This is what we often heard in the Eastern European fraternal countries. Indeed, it is quite far from Beijing to these countries—the closest is almost ten thousand kilometers. However, because Marxism-Leninism has won a decisive victory in vast areas of Asia and Europe, China and all fraternal countries have been united like steel, becoming a friendly and cooperative big family.

In this big family, the people have a common guiding ideology—the ideology of Marxism-Leninism—and are fighting for a common goal—defending world peace, building socialism, and further building a communist society. At the same time, the people live a happy and joyful life. Under the leadership of the workers' party and people's leaders, the people engage in socialist construction with unparalleled enthusiasm and a high degree of labor discipline, and have achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects. For the sake of common ideals and common causes, there is warm friendship and close cooperation between the people of all countries.

The following is the situation of friendship and cooperation that we saw in the Eastern European fraternal countries.

The Soviet Union's Assistance to Eastern European Fraternal Countries and the Love of These Countries for the Soviet Union

The Soviet Union is the liberator of the Eastern European people. Under the leadership of the brilliant strategist, Marshal Stalin, the heroic Soviet army defeated the German fascist bandits and their allies, and the Eastern European people were liberated. For their liberation, many Soviet commanders and fighters shed their last drop of blood. In those places we visited that had been battlefields, there were Soviet military cemeteries and monuments.

After the end of World War II, the Soviet Union gave the Eastern European fraternal countries much help. The socialist construction of these countries is inseparable from the Soviet Union's generous and selfless assistance. For example, the design of the socialist cities they are building was completed under the guidance of Soviet experts; the construction materials and equipment they lacked were shipped from the Soviet Union. Also, the design, equipment, and technical personnel of the modern factories in these countries all came from the Soviet Union. The "Stalin Chemical Plant" in Bulgaria is one example. The major construction projects in these countries are carried out relying on Soviet technical guidance and material assistance. The Romanian canal project is one example.

In addition, the Soviet Union has given these countries a lot of help in education, art, and science. Changes in the education system, reforms in the curriculum, and compilation of textbooks have all been guided by Soviet experts. When we held discussions at the Ministries of Education or visited schools in these countries, we often met Soviet experts. Soviet writers, directors, and other artists also frequently come to these countries to guide artistic work. For example, we have seen many operas, dances, and dramas directed by Soviet comrades. Scientific assistance is mainly in the three areas of industry, agriculture, and medicine.

Eastern European fraternal countries love the Soviet Union: they love Stalin, love the Soviet army, love the Soviet people, and love everything about the Soviet Union. Stalin's name is linked to their liberation, their socialist construction, their happy and joyful lives, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism in vast areas of the world. Everywhere in the Eastern European fraternal countries there are portraits or statues of Stalin. Each country has cities, factories, schools, etc. named after Stalin.

We were in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, when Stalin passed away. The Bulgarian people expressed their deep sorrow for the passing of this greatest genius of our time, the great leader and teacher of the working people all over the world. In the days after Stalin's death, crowds of people carrying wreaths continuously went to the Soviet Embassy to pay their respects. Each government office, school, factory, etc. set up a memorial tablet for Stalin, and people were there day and night to keep vigil in shifts.

The Eastern European people had long been oppressed by foreign imperialists and domestic reactionary governments, so they are very grateful to the Soviet army for defeating the German fascist bandits and liberating them. They witnessed firsthand the Soviet army's bravery, tenacity, alertness, and the finest qualities of patriotism and internationalism. When they told stories of the Soviet army's heroic fighting, they were animated and excited to the point of tears. Every time on the anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and their liberation day, they went in groups, holding wreaths, in a continuous stream to pay their respects to the Soviet military cemeteries. Their love for the Soviet people and the Soviet army is indescribable.

Another manifestation of the Eastern European fraternal countries' love for the Soviet Union is that they learn from the Soviet Union with unparalleled enthusiasm and seriousness. In addition to inviting Soviet experts to guide their work, and sending delegations and students to study in the Soviet Union, they also organize and plan to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experiences in various government offices, organizations, schools, factories, etc. The central task of their Soviet Friendship Associations is to study the Soviet Union, introduce the Soviet Union's advanced experiences, thereby enhancing friendship with the Soviet Union and promoting learning from the Soviet Union.

The Love of Eastern European Fraternal Countries for China

Eastern European fraternal countries deeply understand that the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are of great significance for strengthening and consolidating the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; at the same time, it has a profound impact on the Asian national liberation movement. They deeply realize that with the People's Republic of China, they are safer; the victory of Marxism-Leninism will be further expanded; and the cause of human liberation will have more rapid development.

Eastern European fraternal countries love the Chinese people and love Chairman Mao. Cadres are studying Chairman Mao's works, especially "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They highly praise Chairman Mao's leadership in the Chinese people's revolution which resulted in a great victory, and the brilliant achievements since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Our movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has left a very deep impression on the Eastern European fraternal countries. They greatly admire the brilliant achievements and operational paradigms of the Chinese People's Volunteers. They believe that the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side have dealt a serious blow to the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, and have shattered their aggressive conspiracy, which is a great contribution to defending world peace. At welcome meetings or banquets, comrades from fraternal countries often praised the Chinese People's Volunteers and expressed their great respect for them. A Hungarian comrade once said to us: "If the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers had not stopped the U.S. imperialists' aggression in Korea, European peace might have been threatened, and thus would have seriously affected the peaceful construction of Eastern Europe."

Eastern European fraternal countries pay attention to every achievement of the Chinese people with great concern and interest. They hope to get more reports about People's China. They have translated many Chinese works. They are very interested in learning Chinese. The Chinese language departments of the University of Warsaw in Poland, the Leipzig Foreign Language School in Democratic Germany, Charles University in Czechoslovakia, and Sofia University in Bulgaria, have many young people who are enthusiastically learning Chinese there.

The parties, governments, and people of the Eastern European fraternal countries attach great importance to our cultural and educational delegation, giving us a warm welcome and all conveniences and assistance. The leaders of the fraternal countries are also very concerned about the work and life of our delegation. Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej of Romania and Comrade Chervenkov of Bulgaria personally met and hosted us. Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej personally gave us a report that lasted for several hours. Members of the Central Committee of the fraternal countries' parties and responsible comrades of relevant government departments gave us reports and answered questions. Every place we went, there were responsible comrades from the party and government to receive us.

The Eastern European fraternal countries took care of us meticulously; they treated us very sincerely and kindly. They answered every question we asked, and answered them in great detail. Regarding their work, they not only talked about the advantages, but also emphasized the shortcomings. They are willing to tell us both successful and failed experiences. They often said to us: "If our experience can be of any help to you, we will feel very honored and happy."

The Eastern European fraternal countries received us so warmly, so thoughtfully, and so sincerely that, despite the different living habits, we still felt like we were at home. Most importantly, we and the brothers and sisters in these countries have a common ideology and will, and under the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, we are fighting for a common goal, so we feel very close to each other. When we bid farewell to them, we really felt reluctant to leave. Sometimes we were moved by their enthusiasm and couldn't help but shed tears.

Friendship and Cooperation Between Fraternal Countries

Fraternal countries maintain close cooperation in economic and cultural fields. In the factories of the Eastern European fraternal countries, we saw our orders and the raw materials we supplied: for example, Poland has steel sheets customized by us; Democratic Germany has machines customized by us; Czechoslovakia has locomotives customized by us; Bulgaria has fertilizers purchased by us. In the stores, we saw our agricultural and industrial products.

In Democratic Germany, we saw Poland supplying large amounts of coal, so that the factories there have enough fuel for production. For the convenience of transportation, the newly built integrated metallurgical plant in Democratic Germany was built near the Polish border. In this way, coal and raw materials from Poland can come continuously.

In Bulgaria, we also saw a power plant that Czechoslovakia helped to set up. At the same time, Bulgaria supplies other fraternal countries with large quantities of agricultural products, such as vegetables, fruits, and tobacco. Democratic Germany and Czechoslovakia mainly export machinery to other fraternal countries. Romania supports the economic construction of other fraternal countries with petroleum and timber. In addition to material exchanges, there is also technical cooperation among the fraternal countries. In short, the fraternal countries have implemented a cooperative method of "sharing what they have and lacking what they need." What is mentioned here are just some examples.

In terms of culture, the cooperation between fraternal countries is also very close. We often met cultural delegations sent to each other. For example, in Democratic Germany, we saw the art delegation from Czechoslovakia; in Czechoslovakia, we saw the art delegation from Poland; in Hungary, we saw the cultural delegation from Romania; in Bulgaria, we saw cultural delegations sent by Romania, Hungary, and Poland respectively. The frequent exchanges of delegations show the vitality of cultural cooperation.

In addition, in the fraternal countries, we were very happy to see many Korean children. The fraternal countries take care of them very thoughtfully. Under the guidance of experienced teachers, they study in schools with beautiful environments and complete buildings, living a happy and joyful life.

Unite Closely and Advance Under the Banner of Lenin and Stalin

When we inspected culture and education in the Eastern European fraternal countries, we deeply realized that the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is an incomparably strong big family of friendship and cooperation. The formation of this big family is the result of the victory of Marxism-Leninism in vast areas of Asia and Europe. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, which is universally applicable, and under the leadership of the long-tested workers' party, our big family has achieved brilliant achievements in construction in all aspects. Our friendship and cooperation have made our unity increasingly consolidated and our strength increasingly strengthened. United around us are all the people of the world who love peace, democracy, and justice. Our strength is invincible! Our friendship is unbreakable. Let our friendship develop day by day! Let our cooperation become closer and closer! Let us unite more closely, fight to defend world peace, and advance under the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin!

    和平、民主、友好、合作的大家庭
    赴东欧人民民主国家文化教育考察团团长　韦悫
    马克思列宁主义把我们团结在一起
    “中国人民在地理上离开我们很远，但在思想、感情上，跟我们很接近，像一家人一样。”
    这句话，是我们在东欧各兄弟国家里，常常听到的。的确，从北京到这些国家是相当远的——最近的也差不多一万公里。但是由于马克思列宁主义在亚、欧两洲广大地区获得了决定性的胜利，中国和所有兄弟国家已经钢铁般地团结在一起，成为一个友好、合作的大家庭了。
    在这个大家庭里，人民有着共同的指导思想——马克思列宁主义的思想——并为着共同的目的——保卫世界和平、建设社会主义及进一步建设共产主义社会——而斗争。同时，人民过着幸福、快乐的生活。在工人阶级政党和人民领袖的领导下，人民以无比的热情和高度的劳动纪律，从事社会主义建设，并在各方面都获得了辉煌的成就。为着共同的理想、共同的事业、各国人民间有着亲热的友谊和密切的合作。
    下面就是我们在东欧各兄弟国家里所看到的友好、合作的情形。
    苏联对东欧兄弟国家的帮助及这些国家对苏联的热爱
    苏联是东欧人民的解放者。在天才的战略家——斯大林大元帅——的领导下，英勇的苏联军队击败了德国法西斯匪军及其同盟者，东欧人民才得到了解放。为了他们的解放，许多苏联指挥员和战斗员流了最后的一滴血。我们所到过那些曾经是战场的地方，都有苏军墓和纪念碑。
    第二次世界大战结束后，苏联又给东欧兄弟国家许多帮助。这些国家的社会主义建设是和苏联慷慨无私的帮助分不开的。如他们正在建设的社会主义城市的设计是在苏联专家的指导下完成的；所缺乏的建筑材料和设备是从苏联运来的。又如，这些国家的现代化工厂的设计、装备和技术人员都是从苏联来的。保加利亚的“斯大林化学工厂”是一个例子。又如这些国家的重大建设工程是依靠苏联的技术指导和物质援助来进行的。罗马尼亚运河工程是一个例子。
    此外，在教育、艺术、科学等方面，苏联给予这些国家的帮助也是很多的。学制的变更、课程的改革、教材的编订都得到苏联专家的指导。我们在这些国家的教育部座谈或参观学校的时候，常常遇见苏联专家。苏联作家、导演和其他艺术家也经常到这些国家指导艺术工作。举例来说，我们曾看过苏联同志导演的许多歌剧、舞蹈和话剧。科学上的帮助主要是工业、农业和医学这三方面。
    东欧兄弟国家热爱苏联：他们热爱斯大林，热爱苏联军队，热爱苏联人民，热爱苏联的一切。斯大林的名字是和他们的解放、他们的社会主义建设、他们的幸福快乐的生活、以及马克思列宁主义在世界上广大地区的胜利连在一起的。在东欧兄弟国家到处都有斯大林的肖像或塑像。各国都有以斯大林命名的城市、工厂、学校等等。
    斯大林逝世时，我们正在保加利亚的首都——索非亚。保加利亚人民，对于这个当代最伟大的天才、全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师的逝世，表示了万分的悲痛。在斯大林逝世后的那几天当中，携带着花圈的人群络绎不绝地到苏联大使馆吊唁。各机关、学校、工厂等等均设有斯大林的灵位，日夜有人在那里轮班守灵。
    东欧人民曾长期受外国帝国主义者和国内反动政府的压迫，因而他们对于苏联军队击败了德国法西斯匪军并解放了他们，非常感激。他们亲眼看见苏联军队作战的英勇、顽强、机警及其所表现的爱国主义和国际主义的最优良的品质。当他们讲述苏联军队英勇作战的故事的时候，他们眉飞色舞、兴奋至于流泪。每逢十月社会主义革命节和他们的解放纪念日，他们成群结队，拿着花圈，川流不息地到苏军墓致敬。他们对苏联人民和苏联军队的热爱是无法形容的。
    东欧兄弟国家热爱苏联的另一方面的表现，是他们以无比的热情认真地向苏联学习。除聘请苏联专家指导他们的工作，以及派代表团和留学生去苏联学习外，他们还在各机关、团体、学校、工厂等等有组织地和有计划地学习苏联的先进经验。他们的苏联友好协会的中心任务是研究苏联，介绍苏联的先进经验，从而增进对苏联友好和推动向苏联学习。
    东欧兄弟国家对中国的热爱
    东欧兄弟国家深切了解：中国人民革命的伟大胜利及中华人民共和国的成立，对于加强和巩固以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，有着极重大的意义；同时，对于亚洲民族解放运动有着深远的影响。他们深深体会到有了中华人民共和国，他们便更加安全；马克思列宁主义的胜利将会更加扩大；人类解放事业将会有更迅速的发展。
    东欧兄弟国家热爱中国人民、热爱毛主席。干部都在学习毛主席的著作，特别是“实践论”、“矛盾论”和“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。他们对于毛主席领导中国人民革命获得了伟大的胜利、及中华人民共和国成立以来的辉煌成就，推崇备至。
    我国的抗美援朝运动给东欧兄弟国家以极深刻的印象。他们对于中国人民志愿军的辉煌战绩及作战范例，非常钦佩。他们认为中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，已经给美帝国主义者及其帮凶以严重的打击，粉碎了他们的侵略阴谋，这对于保卫世界和平是一个伟大的贡献。在欢迎会或宴会上，兄弟国家的同志们经常赞扬中国人民志愿军，对他们表示极大的敬意。一个匈牙利同志曾对我们说过：“如果没有英勇的中国人民志愿军阻挡着美帝国主义者在朝鲜的侵略，欧洲和平可能受到威胁，因而对东欧的和平建设会有严重的影响。”
    东欧兄弟国家以极大的关怀和兴趣，注意着中国人民的每一件成就。他们希望得到关于人民中国更多的报道。他们已翻译了不少中国的著作。他们很有兴趣学习中文。波兰华沙大学、民主德国来比锡外国语学校、捷克斯洛伐克查理大学、保加利亚索非亚大学都有中国语文系，有不少青年很起劲地在那儿学习中文。
    东欧兄弟国家的党、政府和人民十分重视我们文化教育考察团，给我们以热烈的欢迎与一切便利和帮助。兄弟国家的领袖也很关心我们考察团的工作和生活。罗马尼亚乔治乌·德治同志和保加利亚契尔文科夫同志亲自接见和设宴招待我们。乔治乌·德治同志并亲自为我们作了长达数小时的报告。兄弟国家的党中央委员和政府有关部门负责同志为我们作报告及解答问题。每到一个地方，都有党和政府的负责同志接待我们。
    东欧兄弟国家照顾我们是无微不至的；对待我们是非常诚恳而亲切的。有问必答，而且答得很详尽。关于他们的工作，他们不独谈优点，还强调缺点。他们愿意把成功的和失败的经验都告诉我们。他们经常对我们说：“如果我们的经验对你们有所帮助，我们将觉得非常荣幸和高兴。”
    东欧兄弟国家接待我们那样热情、那样周到、那样诚恳，尽管生活习惯不同，我们在那里仍觉得像在家里一样。最重要的是我们和这些国家的兄弟姊妹们有共同的思想意志，在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜下，为着共同的目的而奋斗，因而彼此感到非常亲切。我们和他们告别的时候，确有依依不舍的心情。有时为他们的热情所感动，禁不住流泪了。
    各兄弟国家间的友好、合作
    各兄弟国家在经济上和文化上保持着亲密的合作。在东欧兄弟国家的工厂里，我们看到我们的定货和我们供给的原料：如波兰有我们定制的钢片；民主德国有我们定制的机器；捷克斯洛伐克有我们定制的火车头；保加利亚有我们定购的肥田粉。在商店里，我们看到我们的农产品和工业产品。
    在民主德国，我们看到波兰供给大量的煤，使那里的工厂有足够的燃料来进行生产。为了运输上的便利，民主德国新建的联合冶金工厂就建筑在波兰边境附近。这样，波兰的煤和原料便可以源源而来。
    在保加利亚，我们又看到捷克斯洛伐克所帮助设立的发电厂。同时，保加利亚供给其他兄弟国家以大量的农产品、如蔬菜、水果、烟叶等。民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克输出给其他兄弟国家的物资主要是机器。罗马尼亚以石油和木材来支援其他兄弟国家的经济建设。除物资交流外，各兄弟国家还有技术合作。总而言之，各兄弟国家已实行了“有无相通”的合作办法。这里所讲的只是一些例子而已。
    在文化方面，兄弟国家间的合作也是非常密切的。我们经常遇见他们互相派遣的文化代表团。譬如在民主德国，我们看到捷克斯洛伐克的艺术代表团；在捷克斯洛伐克，看到波兰的艺术代表团；在匈牙利，看到罗马尼亚的文化代表团；在保加利亚，看到罗马尼亚、匈牙利和波兰各自派来的文化代表团。代表团来往频繁，表示着文化合作事业的活跃。
    此外，在兄弟国家里，我们非常高兴看到许多朝鲜儿童。兄弟国家照顾他们，十分周到。在经验丰富的老师指导下，他们在环境优美、建筑完备的学校里学习，过着幸福、快乐的生活。
    亲密地团结在一起，在列宁、斯大林的旗帜下前进
    我们在东欧各兄弟国家考察文化教育的时候，深深体会到以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营是一个强大无比的友好、合作的大家庭。这个大家庭的形成是马克思列宁主义在亚、欧两洲广大地区获得胜利的结果。在放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义的指导下，在久经锻炼的工人阶级政党的领导下，我们这个大家庭已经在各方面的建设上获得了辉煌的成就。我们的友好、合作使我们的团结日益巩固，使我们的力量日益加强。团结在我们的周围还有全世界一切爱好和平、民主及正义的人民。我们的力量是无敌的！我们的友谊是牢不可破的。让我们的友谊日益发展！让我们的合作日益密切！让我们更加亲密地团结在一起，为保卫世界和平而奋斗，并在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜下前进吧！
