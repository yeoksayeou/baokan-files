Strengthening Labor Discipline is an Urgent Task

Labor discipline is the conscious discipline of the working class. It requires every employee to faithfully and actively ensure the completion of their work quotas and strive to overfulfill them, to guarantee the quality of their work, to cherish the property of the enterprise, to comply with technical operating and safety and health regulations, to strictly adhere to working hours, and to obey work assignments and transfers. Obeying labor discipline and striving to improve labor productivity are undoubtedly the glorious tasks of our country's working class.

In the past three years, the working class of our country, with selfless labor, launched labor competitions, overcame various difficulties, and restored industrial production. This brilliant labor achievement is undoubtedly inseparable from the conscious labor discipline of the broad masses of workers. It is wrong not to see this fact or to deny it. However, it must also be admitted that, due to the influence of the bad habits left over from the old society, due to the rapid expansion of the working class ranks that has caused a large influx of non-working-class elements into the working class ranks, and due to the weakness of our political education work, the phenomenon of undermining labor discipline still exists, and is even serious; and the current issue is how to universally strengthen and consolidate labor discipline. Some cadres mistakenly believe that emphasizing labor discipline will cause dissatisfaction among the working masses, and even fail to interfere with serious acts of sabotage, abandoning labor discipline education for the working masses. Some cadres one-sidedly believe that the laxity of labor discipline is only due to poor working conditions and welfare work; they fail to see the fact that although working conditions and workers' welfare work still have shortcomings, they have greatly improved. Some cadres have not understood that in the context of various non-working-class ideologies increasingly and complexly encroaching on the working class masses, it is even more necessary to strengthen the education of labor discipline. They think that a lot of political education has been carried out in the past, and the level of consciousness of the working masses is very high, so they have relaxed the continuous communist education of the working masses, so that many workers have an insufficient understanding of the consistency of national interests and individual interests.

At the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his congratulatory speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "We must strengthen the communist education of the working masses, improve their level of consciousness, and make them realize the consistency of the interests of all the people, national interests, and individual interests. At the same time, we must adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism to overcome various shortcomings and errors in enterprises, oppose bureaucracy, oppose all phenomena that undermine labor discipline, and greatly consolidate labor discipline." Implementing Comrade Liu Shaoqi's instructions must become a major political task for our Party and trade union organizations and cadres at all levels. Seriously carrying out this task will surely gain the support and support of the broad masses of workers. After all, elements who undermine labor discipline are in the extreme minority, and they endanger the interests of the working class. Conscious workers cannot tolerate bad elements in their ranks.

The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has discovered that the phenomenon of lax labor discipline widely exists in the city's industrial system, which has seriously hindered the progress of industrial production. They investigated the situation, analyzed it, and found the reasons. They criticized the fact that the Party and trade union organizations in enterprises did not dare to conduct labor discipline education directly to the working masses, and had long turned a blind eye to the phenomenon of lax labor discipline, and adopted the wrong attitude of letting things slide, appeasement, and indulgence. They instructed the Party organizations and trade unions in enterprises throughout the city to combine the transmission of the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions with the current strengthening of planned management, implementation of the responsibility system, and production competition, to conduct extensive labor discipline education among the working masses, mobilize the working masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and oppose the phenomenon of undermining labor discipline. In the past two months, there have been many experiences and significant achievements. Other provinces and cities have similar experiences. These are worthy of everyone's attention and emulation.

Tianjin's experience proves that as long as the leadership attaches importance to labor discipline, actively takes measures to rectify labor discipline, opposes acts of undermining labor discipline, commends models who abide by labor discipline, and relies on the efforts of active elements among the working masses, it will receive a warm response from the broad masses of workers and make the factory look brand new. The state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, since 1950, the attendance rate has been declining month by month and year by year, seriously affecting production. Although the leadership has also thought of many methods, there has been no turning point. This time, after the education of labor discipline, the downward trend of attendance rate was stopped in April, and the attendance rate gradually increased in May and June, thereby gradually restoring the normal order of production, ensuring the completion of the production plan, and improving the quality of yarn and cloth. In the past, when workshop cadres arrived at the factory, they were first busy solving the problem of no one driving the machines, and workshop administrators often put down their management work to drive the machines because there were not enough workers, and everyone was extremely distressed. Now these phenomena have been overcome one by one. They felt relaxed and happy spiritually. After the conscious workers were mobilized, the trade union group became a powerful pillar for maintaining labor discipline. Workers seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism at group meetings, which made the workers who had always been absent from work but still received wages change, and those who used to be unscrupulous in their hooligan behavior also disappeared, and the workers who did not listen to transfers also understood that it was a serious violation of labor discipline. The cadres at the factory level, from the actions of the masses, deeply understood the various erroneous ideas criticized by the Municipal Party Committee, and further realized the harm of economism and tailism. They realized that the more they relaxed and ignored labor discipline, the more they violated the fundamental interests of the working class and the state, and the more they would seriously become detached from the masses.

Tianjin's experience proves that in private enterprises, it is also necessary to educate employees to consolidate labor discipline. In all private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, on the one hand, capitalists must earnestly manage and operate, carry out democratic reform and production reform; on the other hand, the working masses must also actively produce. The workers in private enterprises, like the workers in state-owned enterprises, are already the leading class in the country. Developing production in private enterprises is also in line with the greatest interests of the working class. Therefore, our Party and trade union organizations should also actively enlighten the consciousness of workers in private enterprises and strengthen labor discipline; and for private enterprises with poor working conditions and lack of necessary safety and health equipment, or labor intensity that is too high and affects the health of workers, the labor and management should be consulted to urge the capitalists to carry out necessary and possible improvements in accordance with national policies and laws.

Tianjin's experience proves that to strengthen labor discipline, it is necessary to deeply conduct communist education among the working masses. And the method of carrying out communist education should never be generalized. It must be based on the specific situation of each factory, exposing the phenomenon of lax labor discipline and its harm to production; commending the advanced thinking of advanced workers and groups who have consistently not been absent from work, obeyed transfers, and abided by operating procedures, criticizing the bad ideas that undermine labor discipline, and improving the awareness of the working masses of loving labor and loving the motherland, improving their understanding of labor discipline, so that they truly realize the consistency of national interests and individual interests, and recognize the great future of the working class. After repeated education, mass criticism and self-criticism are carried out among the working masses, and labor discipline will be improved. Those who repeatedly fail to reform and seriously undermine labor discipline should be given appropriate punishment. For those who leave their machines at every turn, who act like hooligans when someone tries to stop them, who curse and swear, and who physically assault others, the working masses have long ceased to recognize them as members of the working class and demand that they be sanctioned. This is completely legitimate. The leadership must properly resolve these issues. This is to put individual elements who undermine labor discipline under the restraint of the masses, as Comrade Stalin taught, "Leadership is guaranteed by the method of persuading the masses – the basic method by which the Party influences the masses. However, this does not absolutely exclude, but rather presupposes, the use of coercive measures, if this coercive means is based on the trust and support of the majority of the working class for the Party, and if this coercive means is applied to the minority after persuading the majority." ("Problems of Leninism" page 196)

Of course, this does not mean that we can fail to prevent impatience among grassroots cadres; on the contrary, we must also overcome the crude practice of simply solving problems with punitive measures. At the same time, in the process of rectifying labor discipline, leaders of state-owned enterprises must pay more attention to workers' lives, improve working conditions, and improve leadership style. We must not allow anyone to use strengthening labor discipline as a shield for "bureaucracy." In private enterprises, we must also educate capitalists to make them understand that the working class is consciously consolidating labor discipline in order to develop production and build an industrialized country, so capitalists should also better actively manage production and improve factory working conditions in order to facilitate the development of production; it is necessary to prevent and oppose any capitalists who do not understand the overall situation and take the opportunity to use the strengthening of labor discipline as an excuse to carry out any unreasonable oppression and attacks on workers.

Obviously, strengthening labor discipline is a regular task. And to strengthen labor discipline, it is necessary to criticize and overcome the bourgeoisie's laziness, hedonism, selfishness and self-interest, as well as the petty bourgeoisie's individualism and undisciplined habits, which are reflected in the ranks of the working class, so that the working masses can draw a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. We not only need to seize the opportunity to carry out a relatively extensive and comprehensive education on labor discipline at present, and quickly establish a set of systems and regulations, but we must also regularly conduct these educations and consolidate these systems. It can be asserted that only by constantly conducting communist ideological education can we overcome the ideology of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and the problem cannot be solved by one or two shock movements. Enterprise leaders, especially Party workers, must correctly recognize that consolidating labor discipline and ensuring the completion of production plans and improving product quality are closely related. It is obvious that if the attendance rate declines every day, it will be impossible to strengthen planned management, to ensure the implementation of work plans, and it will be impossible to carry out labor competitions; if labor discipline is not strengthened, the so-called implementation of the responsibility system and quality inspection will also become empty talk. Therefore, all enterprise leaders must regard consolidating labor discipline as a regular task and as an important method to ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of production plans, in order to fundamentally improve the condition of our enterprises.

### 加强劳动纪律是迫切的任务

    加强劳动纪律是迫切的任务
    劳动纪律是工人阶级自觉的纪律。它要求每一个职工忠实地、主动地保证完成自己的工作定额和争取超额完成工作定额，保证自己工作的质量，爱护企业的财产，遵守技术操作和安全卫生等规程，严格遵守工作时间，服从工作的分配和调动。遵守劳动纪律，努力提高劳动生产率，无疑地是我国工人阶级的光荣任务。
    过去三年来，我国工人阶级以忘我的劳动，展开劳动竞赛，战胜各种困难，恢复了工业生产。这种光辉的劳动业绩，无疑地是和广大工人群众自觉的劳动纪律分不开的。如果不看到这个事实或否认这个事实是不对的。但是，也必须承认，由于旧社会遗留的恶劣习气的影响，由于工人阶级队伍的迅速扩大而引起非工人阶级成分大量涌入工人阶级队伍中来，以及由于我们政治教育工作的薄弱，因而败坏劳动纪律的现象依然是存在的，甚至是严重的；而现在的问题是如何把劳动纪律普遍地加强和巩固起来。有的干部错误地认为强调了劳动纪律，就会引起工人群众的不满，甚至对于严重破坏生产的行为也不加干涉，放弃了对工人群众的劳动纪律教育。有的干部片面地认为劳动纪律松弛只是由于劳动条件不好，福利工作不好；他们看不到劳动条件和工人福利工作虽则还有缺点，但已有了很大改进的事实。有的干部没有了解，在各种非工人阶级的思想作风日益错综地侵袭着工人阶级群众的情况下，更加需要加强劳动纪律的教育。他们以为过去进行了不少政治教育，工人群众的觉悟程度都很高了，因而就放松了向工人群众不断地进行共产主义的教育，以致有许多工人群众对于国家利益和个人利益的一致性的认识还十分不够。
    在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上，刘少奇同志代表中国共产党中央所致的祝词中说：“我们必须对工人群众加强共产主义的教育，提高工人群众的觉悟程度，使他们认识到全体人民的利益、国家利益与个人利益的一致性，同时，必须采取批评与自我批评的方法去克服企业中的各种缺点和错误，反对官僚主义，反对破坏劳动纪律的各种现象，大大地巩固劳动纪律。”贯彻执行刘少奇同志的这个指示，必须成为我们党和工会的各级组织和干部的重大政治任务。认真执行这个任务一定会得到广大工人群众的支持和拥护。败坏劳动纪律的分子毕竟是极少数的，是危害工人阶级利益的。觉悟的工人群众对于自己队伍中的坏分子是不能容忍的。
    中共天津市委员会，发现了全市工业系统中普遍存在着劳动纪律松弛的现象，已严重地妨碍了工业生产的前进。他们调查了情况，进行了分析，找出了原因。他们批判了企业中党和工会的组织不敢正面向工人群众进行劳动纪律的教育，对于劳动纪律松弛的现象长期熟视无睹，以及采取放任、迁就和姑息的错误态度。他们指示全市企业中的党组织和工会，必须结合着中国工会第七次全国代表大会决议的传达，结合着当前加强计划管理、贯彻责任制和生产竞赛，在工人群众中广泛地进行劳动纪律的教育，发动工人群众开展批评和自我批评，反对败坏劳动纪律的现象。两个月以来，已有了许多经验和显著成绩。其他省市也有类似的经验。这些是值得大家重视和仿效的。
    天津的经验证明，只要领导上重视劳动纪律，积极采取措施去整顿劳动纪律，反对破坏劳动纪律的行为，表扬遵守劳动纪律的模范，依靠工人群众中的积极分子的努力，就会得到广大工人群众的热烈响应，使工厂面貌焕然一新。国营天津第一棉纺织厂，从一九五○年以来，出勤率逐月逐年下降，严重地影响了生产，虽然领导方面也曾想过许多办法，但是，一直没有转机。这次，经过劳动纪律的教育，四月份就停止了出勤率下降的趋势，五、六月份出勤率步步提高了，从而逐步恢复了生产的正常秩序，保证了生产计划的完成，提高了纱和布的质量。过去车间干部一到工场，首先忙于解决无人开车的问题，车间管理员经常因工人不够，放下了管理工作去开车，大家都苦恼万分。现在这些现象都逐一克服了。他们精神上感到了轻松愉快。在有觉悟的工人发动起来之后，工会小组就成为维护劳动纪律的有力支柱。工人们在小组会上认真地展开了批评和自我批评，使一贯旷工而照领工资的工人转变了，过去肆无忌惮耍流氓态度的人也敛迹了，不听调动的工人也懂得了那是违犯劳动纪律的严重行为。厂一级的干部，从群众行动中，更深地领会到市委所批判过的种种错误思想，进一步认识到经济主义、尾巴主义的危害性。他们认识到越是对劳动纪律放松不管，违反了工人阶级和国家的根本利益，就越会严重地脱离群众。
    天津的经验证明，在私营企业中，也要对职工进行巩固劳动纪律的教育。在一切有利于国计民生的私营企业中，一方面是资本家必须认真地经营管理，进行民主改革和生产改革；另一方面是工人群众要同样积极生产。私营企业中的工人，和国营企业中的工人一样，已经是国家的领导阶级。在私营企业中发展生产同样是符合于工人阶级最大利益的。因此，我们的党和工会组织同样要积极启发私营企业工人的自觉，加强劳动纪律；而对于劳动条件恶劣和缺乏必要的安全卫生设备，或劳动强度过高，影响到工人健康的私营企业，应经过劳资的协商，督促资方根据国家政策和法令，进行必要和可能的改善。
    天津的经验证明，要加强劳动纪律，就必须深入地向工人群众进行共产主义的教育。而进行共产主义教育的方法绝不应该是一般化的。它必须根据各厂的具体情况，揭发劳动纪律松弛的现象和它对生产的危害性；表扬一贯不旷工、服从调动、遵守操作规程的先进工人和小组的先进思想，批判败坏劳动纪律的坏思想，提高工人群众热爱劳动、热爱祖国的觉悟，提高他们对劳动纪律的认识，使他们真正认识到国家利益和个人利益的一致性，认清工人阶级的远大前途。经过反复的教育，在工人群众中开展了群众性的批评和自我批评，劳动纪律就会提高。对于屡教不改、严重破坏劳动纪律的分子，要给予适当处分。对于那些动不动就关车走了、谁劝阻他就耍流氓态度、破口骂人、动手打人的，工人群众早就不承认他是工人阶级的一分子，都要求给予制裁。这是完全正当的。领导上必须妥善地解决这些问题。这就是要把个别破坏劳动纪律的分子放到群众力量约束之下，正如斯大林同志所教导的，“领导是由说服群众的方法——党用以影响群众的基本方法——来保证的。可是，这并不绝对排斥，而是预定要采用强迫手段，如果这强迫手段是有工人阶级多数对于党的信任和拥护为其基础的，如果这强迫手段是在说服了多数以后来对少数采用的。”（“列宁主义问题”一九六页）
    当然，这并不是说，我们可以不去防止基层干部中的急躁情绪；相反的，我们还必须克服简单地以惩办办法来解决问题的粗暴做法。同时，在整顿劳动纪律的过程中，国营企业的领导者必须更多地关心工人生活，改善劳动条件，改进领导作风。我们决不能容许任何人把加强劳动纪律作为“官僚主义”的挡箭牌。在私营企业中，我们又必须教育资本家，使他们懂得，工人阶级为了发展生产，建设工业化的国家，正自觉地巩固劳动纪律，因此资本家也应该更好地积极经营生产，改善工厂劳动条件，以利于发展生产；要防止和反对任何不明大义的资方，假借加强劳动纪律，趁机对工人进行任何无理的压迫和进攻。
    显然的，加强劳动纪律是一个经常性的工作。而要加强劳动纪律，就要批判和克服反映到工人阶级队伍中来的资产阶级的怠惰、享乐、自私自利以及小资产阶级的个人主义、自由散漫习气等，使工人群众划清工人阶级和资产阶级以及小资产阶级的思想界限。我们不仅需要在目前抓紧进行一次比较广泛和全面的劳动纪律的教育，并迅速建立一套制度和规程，而且必须经常进行这些教育和巩固这些制度。可以肯定，只有经常地进行共产主义的思想教育，才能克服资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想，而不能靠一两次突击运动来解决问题。企业领导者，尤其是党的工作者，要正确认识到巩固劳动纪律和保证完成生产计划，提高产品质量，是密切相联系的。显而易见，如果出勤率天天下降，就一定无法加强计划管理，无法保证作业计划的执行，也无从开展劳动竞赛；如果不加强劳动纪律，所谓实行责任制和进行质量检查也都会成为空谈。因此，所有企业的领导者都必须把巩固劳动纪律当成一项经常的工作，当成保证全面地均衡地完成生产计划的重要方法，以求根本改善我们企业的状况。
