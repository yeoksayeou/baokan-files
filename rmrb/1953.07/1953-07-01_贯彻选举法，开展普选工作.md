Implement the Election Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work
Beijing's Three Pilot Bases for Universal Suffrage Complete Population Census and Voter Registration

The population census and voter registration work in Beijing's three pilot bases for universal suffrage have been completed, and the voter lists for each electoral district have been published.

The work in Beijing's three pilot bases for universal suffrage started simultaneously on June 9th. Over the past two weeks, it has gone through stages of understanding the situation, publicizing to the masses, population census, voter qualification review, and voter registration. From June 18th to 27th, voter lists have been published successively in three electoral districts: Caigongzhuang Township in Haidian District, Guanzhuang Township in the Eastern Suburbs District, and the area under the jurisdiction of the Anfu Hutong Police Station in the Xidan District. The work of dividing voter groups and deliberating on nominating candidates for representatives is now underway.

At the beginning of the pilot work, the work teams first understood the ideological situation of people from all walks of life and carried out extensive publicity through meetings, group meetings, and courtyard meetings. Individual visits were conducted for tricycle workers and vendors who left early and returned late. In this way, the vast majority of residents in each electoral district have enhanced their understanding of the significance and purpose of universal suffrage and actively participated in the universal suffrage activities.

In the less than twenty days of the universal suffrage pilot work, the enthusiasm and concern of the people of the capital for the universal suffrage work can already be seen. As soon as the work teams arrived in the pilot areas, the masses eagerly raised various questions about universal suffrage. Many workers, shop assistants, street activists, and businesspeople voluntarily purchased documents related to universal suffrage for study. Ethnic minorities such as the Hui and Manchu people living in the Anfu Hutong pilot area were deeply satisfied with the Central People's Government's provisions for taking care of ethnic minorities in the Election Law. Many street activists voluntarily helped the work teams understand the situation; more than twenty activists in Caigongzhuang Township in the Western Suburbs participated in the publicity work. Model military family member Dong Sheng took the initiative to convene small forums to publicize the principles of universal suffrage, and farmer Zhang Yongbin even used rhythmic storytelling to promote it. When the voter list in Caigongzhuang Township was posted, voters went to see it in the rain. On the night when voter cards were issued in Guanzhuang Township, most farmers personally went to receive their voter cards despite a day's hard work. Some voters even spoke on the spot, expressing their intention to seriously participate in the election.

In the voter qualification review work, the people of the city demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility for exercising their democratic rights. At the voter qualification review forums in each electoral district of Anfu Hutong, the masses provided the work teams with many clues and useful materials. They tried their best to reflect what they had learned in normal times, helping the election committee and the work teams to judge and study, and carefully determine who should have the right to elect and be elected. Some voters even exposed those landlord class elements who concealed their class status. Some progressive young men and women from landlord families also exposed the fact that their parents concealed their class status. In Guanzhuang Township, two landlord class elements who concealed their class status were also exposed by the masses.

The Beijing universal suffrage pilot work was originally scheduled to end in mid-July. Now, the Beijing Election Committee, in view of the fact that the universal suffrage pilot work must be carried out meticulously and cautiously, and that the suburbs are busy with wheat harvesting and pest control, has decided to postpone the universal suffrage pilot work until the end of July.

Xinjiang Province Election Committee Actively Carries Out Preparations for Universal Suffrage

The Xinjiang Province Election Committee is actively carrying out preparations for universal suffrage, based on the local ethnic characteristics. Twenty-one counties and cities across the province have now formally established election committees. The members of these election committees include representatives from various ethnic groups and strata.

In order to gain experience in grassroots elections and to complete the province's universal suffrage movement prudently and steadily, the Xinjiang Province Election Committee has selected twenty-one townships in ten special districts throughout the province as pilot townships for grassroots elections. These pilot townships include different types of townships such as agricultural, pastoral, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral, ethnic minority communities in suburban areas, and ethnically mixed communities. Dihua City has also selected the Nanliang District, which is inhabited by thirteen ethnic groups, for pilot projects. The cadres who are conducting pilot universal suffrage projects in various special districts have entered the pilot areas after more than ten days of intensive study. The three townships directly led by the Provincial Election Committee have completed the publicity and mobilization work and are now beginning to carry out population surveys and voter registration work.

The Xinjiang Province Election Committee has also reprinted more than 25,000 copies of election manuals in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian languages, and reprinted more than 9 million various survey and registration forms, voter cards, and election certificates in Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Xibe, and Russian languages. These election manuals and registration forms reprinted in various ethnic minority languages have been distributed to various special districts. (Xinhua News Agency)

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    北京市三个普选试办基点完成人口调查和选民登记工作
    北京市三个普选试办基点的人口调查和选民登记工作已经结束，各选区选民名单都已公布。
    北京市三个普选试办基点的工作在六月九日同时开始。半月多来，先后经过了了解情况、向群众宣传、人口调查、选民资格审查和选民登记等阶段，从六月十八日到二十七日，海淀区蔡公庄乡、东郊区关庄乡和西单区安福胡同派出所辖区等三个选区已先后公布了选民名单，现在正在划分选民小组和酝酿提名代表候选人。
    试办工作开始时，工作组首先了解了各界人民的思想情况，分别采用大会、片会、院会等方式进行了广泛的宣传。对那些早出晚归的三轮车工人和小贩等，都进行了个别访问。这样，各选区绝大多数居民都提高了对普选的意义和目的的认识，积极地参加普选活动。
    在不到二十天的普选试办工作中，已经可以看出首都人民对普选工作的热情和关怀。工作组刚一到达各试办区时，群众就急切地向他们提出了各种各样有关普选的问题。许多工人、店员、街道积极分子和工商界人士自动购买有关普选的文件进行学习。住在安福胡同试办区的回族和满族等少数民族，对中央人民政府在选举法中照顾少数民族的规定都深为满意。许多街道积极分子自动帮助工作组了解情况，西郊蔡公庄乡有二十多个积极分子参加了宣传工作。模范军属董升主动召集小型座谈会宣传普选的道理，农民张永斌更说着快板进行宣传。蔡公庄乡的选民榜贴出的时候，选民们冒雨前去观看。关庄乡发选民证的那天晚上，大部分农民都不顾一天的辛劳，亲自跑去领选民证，有的选民还当场讲了话，表示要认真参加选举。
    在选民资格审查工作中，全市人民对于行使自己的民主权利的责任心，表现得十分明显。安福胡同各选区在审查选民资格的座谈会上，群众给工作组提供了很多线索和有用的材料。他们把平日所了解到的情况尽量反映出来，帮助选举委员会和工作组判断和研究，慎重确定那些人应有选举权和被选举权，有的选民并揭发了那些隐瞒成份的地主阶级分子，有些地主家庭出身的进步青年男女还揭发了他们家长隐瞒成份的事实。关庄乡也有两个隐瞒成份的地主阶级分子被群众检举出来。
    北京市普选试办工作，原决定七月中旬结束，现在北京市选举委员会鉴于普选试办工作必须细致而慎重地进行，同时郊区正忙于麦收和灭虫，所以决定将普选试办工作延迟到七月底结束。

    新疆省选举委员会积极进行普选准备工作
    新疆省选举委员会正依据当地民族特点，积极进行普选准备工作。现在全省已有二十一个县、市正式成立了选举委员会。这些选举委员会的委员包括当地各民族和各阶层的代表人物。
    为了取得基层选举的经验，慎重地稳步地完成全省普选运动，新疆省选举委员会在全省十个专区选择了二十一个乡，作为基层选举典型试办乡。这些典型试办乡包括农业、畜牧、半农半牧、市郊民族聚居和民族杂居等不同类型的乡。迪化市并选择了十三个民族杂居的南梁区进行试办。各专区进行普选典型试办的干部，经过十多天集中学习后，已进入试办地区。省选举委员会直接领导试办的三个乡，已完成宣传动员工作，现正开始进行人口调查和选民登记工作。
    新疆省选举委员会并用维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古等三个民族的文字翻印了两万五千多册选举手册，用维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古、锡伯、俄罗斯等五个民族的文字翻印了九百多万张各种调查、登记表格和选民证、当选证。这些用各民族文字翻印的选举手册和登记表格已经发到各个专区。（新华社）
