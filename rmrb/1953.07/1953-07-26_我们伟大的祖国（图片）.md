    Young Pioneers use their holidays to visit various places, which not only allows them to observe nature and gain rich knowledge, but also increases their love for the great motherland. This is a group of Young Pioneers from the Central Primary School of the Third District of Jilin City, Northeast China. They are looking out over the city of Jilin on the banks of the Songhua River from the heights of Jilin Beishan Park.
