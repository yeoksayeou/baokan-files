Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd. The material supply work of the basic construction material supply department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been greatly improved after more than two months of the establishment of the responsibility system movement.

The 1953 material supply plan originally formulated by the basic construction material supply department of Anshan Iron and Steel was mostly compiled based on estimates from narrow experience and dominated by the conservative idea of "planning generously and using sparingly." The results of its implementation in the first quarter showed that this plan was not realistic. In order to avoid the accumulation of large amounts of materials and funds in the future, the material supply department first mobilized all employees during the establishment of the responsibility system movement to expose the waste of materials and the phenomenon of no one being responsible. Then, it focused on the three main links of the material supply plan, warehouse management, and the waste materials on the construction site, and further mobilized employees to revise the plan, inventory materials, and carry out recycling work. After a preliminary inventory, the general warehouse of the Materials Department found more than 150 billion yuan worth of stockpiled materials that could be allocated to other construction units by the state for use. After careful study and calculation, the material supply plan has been reduced by 30%, making this originally largely blind plan a more advanced plan.

In the movement to establish the responsibility system, the material supply department adjusted its internal structure and clarified the scope of its business, thus clarifying the responsibilities of each link. For example, the planning section of the Material Department, in accordance with the principle of facing the construction site, set up several professional groups, changing the situation of "doing everything at once." In the past, the material section did not know about plan changes and material requirements, and the planning section did not know about material sources and inventory quantities. When problems occurred, no one was responsible, and no one took responsibility. Now, the Material Department has formulated internal rules of procedure, and a contact system has been established between the relevant units. The purchasing unit must check the inventory before purchasing materials; the acceptance unit must check the quantity, quality, and specifications on the plan and contract during acceptance; the storage unit must periodically inventory the inventory materials and check the accounts; after issuing the equipment, it is necessary to understand the actual needs and recover them on time. In this way, each link from procurement to allocation has clear responsibilities, strengthening the planning of material supply work and greatly reducing waste and backlog. Recently, the thin plate factory construction site requested more than 500,000 steel bricks. The comrades of the material section went to the construction site to investigate and compared the plan with the amount of inventory. As a result, it was enough to issue only more than 200,000 steel bricks.

    在建立责任制运动中
    鞍钢基本建设材料供应工作有很大改进
    【新华社鞍山三日电】鞍山钢铁公司基本建设材料供应部门，经过两个多月来的建立责任制运动，材料供应工作已有很大改进。
    鞍钢基本建设材料供应部门原来所订的一九五三年材料供应计划，大部分是根据狭隘经验的估计和在“宽打窄用”的保守思想支配下编制出来的，在第一季度执行结果，说明这个计划是不切合实际的。为了避免今后积压大量的材料和资金，材料供应部门在建立责任制运动中，就首先发动全体职工揭发浪费材料和无人负责的现象，然后抓住材料供应计划、仓库管理、工地的废旧器材这三个主要环节，进一步发动职工进行了修订计划、清点材料和回收工作。材料处总仓库经过初步清点，查出了价值一千五百多亿元的积压材料，可以交给国家调拨到其他建设单位去使用。材料供应计划经过认真的研究、计算以后，已削减了百分之三十，使得这个原来带着很大程度的盲目性的计划变成比较先进的计划了。
    在建立责任制的运动中，材料供应部门调整了内部机构，划清了业务范围，这样就使各个环节的职责明确起来。如材料处的计划科，按照面向工地的原则，分设几个专业组，改变了工作一把抓的情况。过去材料科不知道计划变动和材料需要量，计划科不知道材料来源和库存数量，发生问题时，谁也负责，谁也不负责。现在材料处已制订出内部的办事细则，各有关单位之间都建立了联系制度。采购单位在采购材料前要查清库存；验收单位在验收时要查对计划和合同上的数量、质量、规格；保管单位要定期盘点库存物资，查对账目；发出器材后，要了解实际需要和按时回收。这样，从采购到拨付，每个环节都有明确的职责，加强了材料供应工作的计划性，大大减少了浪费和积压现象。最近薄板厂工地要求领钢砖五十多万块，材料科的同志就到工地去进行调查，对照计划和库存的数量，结果只要发给二十多万块钢砖就够了。
