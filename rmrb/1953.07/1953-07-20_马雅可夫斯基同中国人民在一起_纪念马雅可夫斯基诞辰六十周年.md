    Mayakovsky is with the Chinese People - Commemorating the 60th Anniversary of Mayakovsky's Birth
    Cao Jinghua
    Hundreds of millions of
        workers' China!
    For the sake of eternal friendship,
    Let us
        join hands! Settle accounts
    with the imperialists!
    -- Mayakovsky: "Note to China"

    In his article "Lu Xun and the Relationship of Russian Literature," Comrade Feng Xuefeng wrote: "The influence and help that 19th and early 20th century Russian literature and modern Soviet literature have given to modern Chinese literature exceeds any other world literature... A brief review will show us: the influence of the great Shakespeare and Goethe here is extremely superficial and weak; but Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Gorky are obviously somewhat different. Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, and Romain Rolland, etc., can be said to have influence; but they are not as influential as Tolstoy, Turgenev, and Gorky. Whitman and Jack London also have some influence, but they are not as influential as Mayakovsky and Gorky..."

    This is an indisputable fact.

    Compared with prose, poetry, due to the limitations of rhyme and other formats, has always been more difficult for poets to cross their own national boundaries. But Mayakovsky is an exception. His influence on China, on revolutionary literature worldwide, and on the revolutionary movement, surpasses that of any poet of any country in history. This is not because of the novelty of the form of his poems, but because he took the lofty ideals of Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet Party to liberate all mankind and build the most beautiful life as the soul of his poetry, reflecting the ardent expectations of the working people of the world for thousands of years. Therefore, he was able to break through the limitations of language with the whirlwind of the great October Revolution, cross the Russian border, and resonate strongly in the hearts of working people all over the world, igniting the flames of hope and forming a huge, combative, and actionable force.

    We see:

    Comrades,
        of all mankind
    on the entire planet,
    declare:
        No War!

    This is the cry of hundreds of millions of people in every corner of the world today. This is a righteous and great call. This cannot be measured by the meaning of poetry in the general sense of "poetics." Mayakovsky's poetry is the greatest poetry that stirs the hearts of all righteous people in the world. Tikhonov said in the Soviet Literature Newspaper on April 12, 1950, that Mayakovsky's revolutionary enthusiasm, unparalleled genius, high level of ideology, ardent patriotism, hatred of revolutionary enemies and dark forces, internationalist mind, etc., "we cannot find this combination in the history of world literature."

    Therefore, the works of this "great son of the 'attacking class'," as Guo Moruo said in his poem inscribed at the Mayakovsky Museum:

    Your songs
    like a storm
        flew over
    Central Asia,
    any
    mountains,
    deserts,
        oceans,
    cannot stop
        you!

    In the last chapter of "A Brief History of Russian Literature," "New Writers of Labor-Peasant Russia," which Comrade Qu Qiubai wrote for Comrade Zheng Zhenduo in 1923, he said that Mayakovsky "lived for the revolution, breathed revolution, and ate and slept revolution."

    The Chinese people have always regarded Mayakovsky not only as a
    "the most outstanding and talented poet of the Soviet era," but first and foremost as a revolutionary, as their fighting inspirer, as their most loyal and closest comrade-in-arms. Because he deeply felt the oppression of the Chinese people by imperialism and feudal forces for nearly a hundred years, and shouted and fought together with the Chinese people who were striving for liberation.

    On the eve of the Chinese Revolution, Mayakovsky, seeing the imperialists rampant in China, published "Get Out of China!" in the "News" on September 21, 1924. He shouted loudly:

    "Gangsters of the world, get out of China!" "We are with you, Chinese people!"

    On March 21, 1927, Mayakovsky recited his poems at an evening party in Yaroslavl. Upon hearing that the Northern Expeditionary Army had arrived in Shanghai and that the Shanghai workers' uprising had occupied Shanghai, he wrote a poem entitled "Better Poetry," and with boundless joy and excitement, shouted in a loud voice: "Comrades! Workers and the Guangdong army have occupied Shanghai! ... People of Yaroslavl, oil workers and textile workers, clap your hands to the unknown and dear Chinese coolies!"

    In April of the same year, in the poem "Gloomy Humor," the poet wanted to use the
    "sharpest bayonet" to deal with the "international conspirators" who invaded China.

    In 1928, in the poem "For the Children," Mayakovsky had a poem "Let's Talk, Let's Go to Paris and China," which mentioned that "China is a land of tea and rice," but because of the exploitation and bullying of the imperialists, the Chinese people often could not eat or drink tea. He also said:

    Chinese children
    like Russians.
    Treat us
    like brothers to brothers.

    There is an old Chinese saying: "A friend in need is a friend indeed." At that time, when the Chinese people were suffering from the bullying of imperialist bandits, Mayakovsky reached out his warm, brotherly hand of assistance to the Chinese people from thousands of miles away. The Chinese people cherish this deep revolutionary morality. Today, as the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of their genius leader Chairman Mao and the Party, have driven out the imperialist bandits who have been entrenched for more than a hundred years, eliminated the reactionary regime, and are victoriously building a new life, commemorating the birth of their comrade-in-arms in adversity has a particularly profound significance.

    The Chinese people have always deeply respected their comrades-in-arms. According to "The History of Chidu's Heart," as early as thirty-two years ago, in February 1921, Comrade Qu Qiubai visited the poet. On June 10 of the same year, the "Eastern Miscellany," Volume 18, Issue 11, published by the Shanghai Commercial Press, introduced Meyerhold, who was "most respected by the Russians at that time," in a short article, "Russian Free Poetry." From that time until now, no matter how language isolates them, no matter how particularly difficult it is to translate the poet's poems, and no matter how the reactionaries have suppressed the introduction of Soviet literature during the long period of reactionary rule, "Selected New Russian Poems," "The Loud Voice" (i.e., "Full Voice"), "A Cloud in Trousers" (fragments), "Lenin,"
    "For the Children," "Selected Poems of Mayakovsky" and other collections of poems, as well as several special records of biographies and studies of Mayakovsky, have been printed in China. His major poems such as the long poem "Lenin," "Good!" (excerpt), and "Full Voice," "Left March," "Soviet Passport,"
    "Our March," "Meeting Mania," "Get Out of China!", "Better Poetry," etc., have not only been translated into Chinese, but some of them also have several translations. These poems have not only become the most beloved poems of the vast Chinese readership, constantly recited at evening parties everywhere, but have also long inspired the Chinese people to advance victoriously.

    China's most outstanding writers, such as Qu Qiubai, Guo Moruo, Xiao San, Ge Baoquan, Liu Baiyu, and Tian Jian, have expressed their infinite love and high appreciation for Mayakovsky in their poems and articles. However, Mayakovsky's influence in China is not only reflected in the poems and articles of these writers. In their long and arduous struggle, the Chinese people have always heard the inspiring voice of the poet. "We are with you, Chinese people!"

    On October 5, 1951, Ehrenburg said this at the National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Beijing: "There is a proverb in our Soviet Eastern Republic: 'A bad friend is like a shadow, he is only with you when the sun is shining in the sky.' However, the friendship between our two peoples has withstood many years of testing: we are together when the sun is shining in the sky, we are together when dark clouds cover the sky, we are together in adversity, and we are together in victory." Mayakovsky will forever be with the strong, peace-loving Chinese people, and with the working people of the world.

    We firmly believe that no matter how cunning the hunter is, and no matter how ferocious his hounds are, they can never block the great poet's overwhelming call:

    Comrades,
        of all mankind
    on the entire planet,
    declare:
        No War!

    We firmly believe that those who play with fire will ultimately only meet with shameful destruction!

    马雅可夫斯基同中国人民在一起——纪念马雅可夫斯基诞辰六十周年
    曹靖华
    数万万的
    工人的中国！
    为了永恒的友谊
    让我们
    携手吧！跟帝国主义者
    算账！
    ——马雅可夫斯基：“致中国照会”
    冯雪峰同志在“鲁迅和俄罗斯文学的关系”一文中，有这样一段话：“十九世纪和二十世纪初的俄罗斯文学和现代的苏联文学，所给予现代中国文学的影响和帮助，超过任何其他的世界文学……我们稍稍回顾一下就可以知道：伟大的莎士比亚和歌德，在我们这里的影响，是极浮泛和微弱的；但普希金、托尔斯泰、高尔基，却显然有些不同。巴尔札克、佛罗培尔、左拉、罗曼·罗兰等，是可说有影响的；但也不及托尔斯泰、屠格涅夫、高尔基等的影响大。韦特曼和杰克·伦敦，也有些影响的，但也不及马雅可夫斯基和高尔基的影响大……”
    这是不可争辩的事实。
    诗同散文比较起来，因为韵律等格式的限制，诗人从来是更难跨越自己的国界的。可是马雅可夫斯基却例外。他对中国，对全世界革命文学以及革命运动的影响，超过了历代各国的任何诗人。这原因不在他的诗的形式的新奇，而在他以列宁、斯大林及苏联党的解放全人类，建设最美满生活的崇高理想为诗魂，反映了全世界劳动人民千百年来的热切期望，所以他能与众不同地，随着伟大十月革命的旋风，突破了语言的限制，跨过了俄罗斯国境，在全世界劳动人民的心坎里，起了强烈的共鸣，燃起了希望的火焰，形成了巨大的、战斗的、行动的力量。
    我们看：
    全星球上的
        人类同志们，
    宣告吧：
        不要战争！
    这是今天世界上各角落里亿万人的呼声。这是正义的伟大的号召。这是不能拿一般“诗学”上所说的诗的意义来衡量的。马雅可夫斯基的诗是激动着全世界正义人类心灵的最伟大的诗。吉洪诺夫在一九五○年四月十二日苏联文学报上说马雅可夫斯基的革命的热情，举世无匹的天才，高度的思想性，火热的爱国主义，对革命敌人及黑暗势力的仇视，国际主义的胸怀等等，“这一切的结合，我们在世界文学史中是找不到的。”
    因此，这位“‘进攻阶级’的伟大的儿子”的作品，就如郭沫若先生在参观了马雅可夫斯基纪念馆所题的诗中说：
    你的歌声
    如像风暴
        飞过了
    中央亚细亚，
    任何的
    山岳
    沙漠
        海洋
    都阻挡不了
        你！
    瞿秋白同志在一九二三年替郑振铎同志编的“俄国文学史略”所写的最后一章“劳农俄国的新作家”中，说马雅可夫斯基“以革命为生活，呼吸革命，寝馈革命。”
    中国人民就是从来不但把马雅可夫斯基当作一位
    “苏维埃时代最优秀，最有才华的诗人”看待，而首先是把他当作一位革命家，当作自己的战斗的鼓舞者，当作最忠诚，最亲密的战友看待的。因为他深深地感到近百年来中国人民所受帝国主义和封建势力的压迫，同争取解放的中国人民一起呐喊，一起战斗的。
    中国大革命前夜，马雅可夫斯基看到帝国主义者在中国横行，就于一九二四年九月二十一日在“消息报”上发表了“滚出中国！”，他大声疾呼：
    “世界上的强盗们，滚出中国！”“我们同你们在一起，中国人！”
    一九二七年三月二十一日，马雅可夫斯基在亚洛斯拉夫城一个晚会上朗诵自己的诗，听到北伐军到了上海，上海工人起义占领了上海，就作了一首题为“更好的诗”，以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情，用响亮的声音高呼道：“同志们！工人和广东军队占领了上海！……亚洛斯拉夫城的人，打油工人和纺织工人们，向不认识的和亲人般的中国苦力鼓掌吧！”
    在同年四月，在“沉郁的幽默”一诗里，诗人要用
    “最锋利的枪刺”对付侵略中国的“国际阴谋家”。
    一九二八年，马雅可夫斯基在“给孩子们”的诗里，有一首“谈吧，到巴黎和中国去吧”，在这里谈到“中国是茶米之乡”，可是因为受帝国主义者的剥削与欺凌，中国人却常常吃不到饭，喝不到茶。又说：
    中国的孩子
    欢喜俄国人。
    对待我们
    就如同弟兄对待弟兄。
    中国有一句古话：“患难见知交”。在那时，中国人民倍受帝国主义强盗欺凌的时候，马雅可夫斯基从万里外向中国人民伸出了热情的兄弟般的援助的手，这深厚的革命道义，中国人民是异常珍贵的。中国人民，在他的天才领袖毛主席和党的英明领导下，驱逐了盘据百余年的帝国主义强盗，消灭了反动政权，胜利地建设新生活的今日，来纪念自己的患难战友的诞辰，这意义是特别深长的。
    中国人民对自己的战友，从来是倍加崇敬的。据“赤都心史”所记，远在三十二年以前，即一九二一年二月，瞿秋白同志就曾访问过诗人。同年六月十日，上海商务印书馆出版的“东方杂志”第十八卷第十一期上，在“俄国的自由诗”短文中，就介绍了当时“最受俄国人崇敬的梅耶谷夫斯基”。从那时起，直到目前为止，不管语言怎样地阻隔，不管诗人的诗是怎样特别地难译，也不管在长期反动统治时代反动派对苏联文学介绍是怎样地横压，在中国仍印行了“新俄诗选”，“呐喊”（即“放开嗓子唱”），“裤中的云”，（片断），“列宁”，
    “给孩子们”，“马雅可夫斯基诗选”等诗集以及关于马雅可夫斯基传记，研究的专记数种。他的主要诗作如长诗“列宁”，“好！”（节译）及“放开嗓子唱”，“左翼进行曲”，“苏联护照”，
    “我们的进行曲”，“开会迷”，“滚出中国！”，“更好的诗”等等，不但都译成了中文，而且其中有些还有数种译文。这些诗不但都成了中国广大读者最爱的诗篇，不断在各处晚会上朗诵，而且长期地鼓舞着中国人民胜利地前进。
    中国最优秀的作家如瞿秋白，郭沫若，萧三，戈宝权，刘白羽，田间等，在自己的诗文里，对马雅可夫斯基都表示着无限的敬爱与极高的估价。然而，马雅可夫斯基在中国的影响，还不仅表现在这些作家的诗文里。中国人民在长期艰苦的斗争里，随时都听到了令人鼓舞的诗人的呼声。“我们同你们在一起，中国人！”
    一九五一年十月五日，爱伦堡在北京中苏友好协会全国代表会议上，讲过这样的话：“我们苏联的东方共和国有一句谚语：‘不好的朋友像影子，只有天空出太阳的时候，他才同你在一起。’可是，我们两国人民之间的友谊却经得起许多年的考验：天空出太阳的时候，我们同在一起，黑云密布天空的时候，我们同在一起，在患难中，在胜利中，我们都在一起。”马雅可夫斯基永远同坚强的，酷爱和平的中国人民在一起，同世界劳动人民在一起的。
    我们坚信：无论猎人怎样狡猾，也无论他所豢养的猎犬怎样凶顽，绝对遮不断伟大诗人的压倒一切的号召：
    全星球上的
    人类同志们，
    宣告吧：
    不要战争！
    我们坚信：玩火者最后所得到的只有可耻的毁灭！
