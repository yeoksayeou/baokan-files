Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 19th: The agricultural region of the southwestern plains of the United States is experiencing an unprecedented severe drought this year. In the western parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, and parts of Colorado and New Mexico, vast fields and pastures have become cracked and barren. The severity exceeds the great American drought of 1934-36.

The drought in the southwestern United States has persisted for four years. The US government spends tens of billions of US taxpayer dollars manufacturing munitions and building military bases, but only allocates meager funds for token farmland water conservancy projects. This year's particularly low rainfall has further exacerbated the situation. According to American press reports, rainfall in the southern region of Texas, the hardest-hit by the drought, is less than 25% of normal. Since the beginning of summer, temperatures have frequently been above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The Rio Grande River, which separates Texas and Mexico, has completely dried up below Laredo. Throughout the drought-stricken areas, loess covers the ground, and dust and smog fill the sky, forcing even airplanes to fly at altitudes of 3,000 meters.

The drought is severely impacting agricultural production. According to American press estimates, Texas's main product, wheat, will be reduced to about one-third of normal harvest this year, and cotton will be reduced by about half. The livestock industry has been severely hit. Due to the lack of pasture, large numbers of livestock have become emaciated. According to Agriculture Secretary Benson, 13 million head of livestock in 128 counties in Texas and more than 2 million head of livestock in 40 counties in Oklahoma have been affected by the drought. Cattle ranchers are driving their cattle, including vaccinated ones, to market to sell them because they cannot feed them. This has flooded the markets in cities such as Fort Worth and Dallas with cattle, causing prices to plummet. In Dallas, some cows are selling for as little as five cents a pound.

Many farmers in the affected areas have been forced to abandon their fields and wander into the cities. "Time" magazine, in its July 6th issue, described the scene in a small town in the disaster area, saying: This town "has been without water for more than a year, and it costs 60 cents a hundred gallons to transport water from other places. The area has had no wheat or cotton harvest for three years, and surrounding the town are abandoned farms and many empty houses and commercial buildings."

    美国西南部旱灾严重
    【新华社十九日讯】纽约消息：美国西南部平原农业区今年发生空前严重的旱灾。在得克萨斯、俄克拉何马、堪萨斯三州的西部和科罗拉多、新墨西哥州的部分地区，广大的田地和牧场都干裂荒芜，严重情况超过一九三四—三六年的美国大旱灾。
    美国西南地区的干旱现象已继续了四年之久，美国政府花费成百亿美国纳税人的钱去制造军火和建立军事基地，却只拨出微不足道的款项作为农田水利的点缀。今年雨水特别缺乏，就使情况更加恶化。据美国报刊报道，在旱灾最重的得克萨斯州南部地区，今年雨量不足正常雨量的百分之二十五。入夏以来，温度经常在华氏一百度以上。得克萨斯州和墨西哥分界的格兰得河自拉里多城以下，河床已全部干涸。旱灾地区内黄土遍地，尘雾漫天，甚至飞机都不得不在三千公尺高空飞行。
    旱灾严重地打击着农业生产，据美国报刊估计，得克萨斯州的主要产品小麦今年将减少到正常收获量的三分之一左右，棉花将减少一半左右。畜牧业受到重大的打击。由于缺乏牧草，大批牲畜已饿成皮包骨头。据农业部长本逊宣布，受到旱灾影响的有得克萨斯一百二十八个县中一千三百万头牲畜和俄克拉何马州四十个县中两百万头以上的牲畜。养牛的人把他们无法饲养的牛群包括接种的牛都赶到市场上去出卖。这使得华士堡、达拉斯等城的市场上一时牛类充斥，价格暴跌。在达拉斯，有些母牛的卖价低到五分美金一磅。
    受灾地区许多农民已被迫抛弃自己的田园，流浪到城市里。美国“时代”周刊在七月六日的一期中描写被灾地区中一个小镇的景象说：这个小镇“已有一年多没有水，要花六角美金一百加仑的价钱从外地运水去。这个地区的小麦和棉花已三年无收，围绕着这个村镇的是被遗弃的农场和许多空无一人的房屋与商业建筑。”
