Xinhua News Agency, July 7th Dispatch from London: Due to the destruction of bilateral trade policies by the United States and other capitalist countries, Britain's trade situation in some important traditional markets has deteriorated sharply.

Britain has always used bilateral trade agreements with certain countries to maintain and expand its foreign trade markets, but this does not meet the requirements of the US monopoly capital that wants to monopolize the capitalist world market. Therefore, the United States and West Germany and Japan, which are supported by it, try to undermine the bilateral trade relations between Britain and other capitalist countries and attack Britain's position.

This market competition has seriously affected the bilateral trade established between Britain and some countries. The "Financial Times," the mouthpiece of British monopoly capitalists, expressed great concern about this in an editorial. The newspaper pointed out that West Germany's export trade to Egypt has greatly increased. In 1949, the total value of West Germany's sales in the Egyptian market was only 600,000 pounds for the whole year. By the beginning of this year, the monthly sales volume had exceeded 1 million pounds. However, the sales volume of British goods has dropped sharply. At present, Britain's exports to Egypt have been surpassed by West Germany "for the first time in history," with only 1 million pounds per month.

The "Financial Times" said uneasily: "Unfortunately, the decline in British exports to Egypt is only a manifestation of a wider and more disturbing situation. In the past two years, the trade relations between Britain and those countries that do not belong to any major currency area and that have so far conducted trade under the guidance of so-called bilateral agreements are constantly disintegrating." The newspaper further pointed out that the trade volume between Britain and Egypt, Brazil, Argentina, and Iran reached 423 million pounds in 1951, accounting for 10% of Britain's total foreign trade. In the first three months of this year, it has dropped to an annual rate of 170 million pounds, accounting for only 3% of the total foreign trade. The newspaper said in a low tone: "These are just some of the worst examples." If the losses caused by the partial "freezing" of the flow of goods with other smaller bilateral agreement countries are added together, it will constitute a "terrible figure."

When analyzing the reasons for this situation, the newspaper complained that "other countries" took advantage of the difficulties in trade between countries that have bilateral agreements with Britain to take advantage of the situation. The newspaper said: "Other manufacturing countries may have snatched away most of the business that Britain has lost in bilateral trade by purchasing high-priced commodities such as those from Brazil and Egypt through special arrangements."

In order to make up for the damage caused to British trade by the disintegration of bilateral trade methods and to "lay the foundation for further expansion of trade," the newspaper advocated that Britain must adapt to the situation and change its foreign trade policy to replace bilateral trade with competitive multilateral trade.

### 在美国以及其他资本主义国家的打击和排挤下  英国在其传统市场上的贸易情况越来越坏

    在美国以及其他资本主义国家的打击和排挤下
    英国在其传统市场上的贸易情况越来越坏
    【新华社七日讯】伦敦消息：由于双边贸易政策遭到美国及其他资本主义国家的破坏，英国在某些重要传统市场上的贸易情况急剧恶化。
    英国一向利用与某些国家订立双边贸易协定的办法来保持和扩大它的对外贸易市场，但是这不符合于想独占资本主义世界市场的美国垄断资本的要求。因此，美国和在它扶植下的西德和日本便设法破坏英国与其他资本主义国家之间的双边贸易关系，打击英国的地位。
    这种市场的争夺已使英国与某些国家建立的双边贸易受到严重影响。英国垄断资本家的喉舌“金融时报”在一篇社论里对此表示非常忧虑。该报指出：西德对埃及的出口贸易已大大增加。在一九四九年，西德在埃及市场上的销货总值全年只有六十万英镑，到本年初，每月销货量已超过一百万英镑。但是英国货的销售量却急剧下降，目前英国对埃及的输出，已“历史上第一次”被西德超过，每月不过一百万英镑。
    “金融时报”不安地说：“不幸的是，英国对埃及输出的衰退只是更广泛、更令人不安的事情的一个表现，而在过去两年中，英国和那些不属于任何主要货币地区而且与英国迄今在所谓双边协定指导下进行贸易的国家之间的贸易关系，正不断解体。”该报进一步指出，英国与埃及、巴西、阿根廷和伊朗四国的贸易额，在一九五一年曾达到四亿二千三百万英镑，占英国对外贸易总数的百分之十，到今年头三个月，已降至年率一亿七千万英镑，只占对外总贸易量的百分之三。该报语调低沉地说：“这仅是一些最坏的例子”，如果再把由于与其他较小的双边协定国家的货物流转部分地陷于“冻结”所造成的损失加在一起，便构成“可怕的数字”了。
    这家报纸在分析造成这一情况的原因时，抱怨“其他国家”利用与英国订立双边协定的一些国家和英国进行贸易中的困难趁火打劫。该报说：“其他制造业国家通过特殊安排的办法购进像巴西和埃及的高价商品，可能已经抢走了英国在双边贸易中所损失的生意的大部分。”
    为了弥补由于双边贸易方式的解体给英国贸易所造成的损害，并且为“进一步扩展贸易打下基础”，该报主张英国必须适应情况，改变对外贸易政策，以富于竞争性的多边贸易来代替双边贸易。
