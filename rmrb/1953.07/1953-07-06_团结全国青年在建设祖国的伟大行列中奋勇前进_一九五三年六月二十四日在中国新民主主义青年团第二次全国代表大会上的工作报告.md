Dear delegates and friends:

It has been over four years since we held our first national congress. In these four years, our motherland has undergone tremendous changes. Under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, our people have finally overthrown the evil rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, established a new nation led by the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, truly united, independent, and people's democratic. We have basically completed social democratic reforms, restored and developed the national economy, and engaged in the great struggle to aid Korea and resist America, powerfully defending peace in the Far East and the world.

These great victories have paved the way for our planned construction of the motherland. Our country is now entering a new period of gradually realizing national industrialization and transitioning to a socialist society.

Our country is advancing in such great strides that all peace-loving and justice-seeking people around the world are thrilled and excited, while all reactionaries are trembling with fear. No force in the world can stop our people from marching towards greater victories. Each of us is filled with unwavering confidence in the bright and beautiful future of our motherland.

Who has led us from one victory to another? It is the glorious Communist Party of China, our most beloved leader and teacher, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the organizer and inspirer of all our victories. The Chinese people have Chairman Mao's leadership, which is a great fortune. Chinese youth are proud to live in the era of Mao Zedong.

At this congress, we will review what we have done for our motherland and study how to respond to the expectations of our motherland in this new period.

I.

Comrades! Modern Chinese youth movements have always developed under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have always paid great attention to the Chinese youth movement. Our party and Chairman Mao have always regarded the youth movement since the May Fourth Movement as "an important front." After the party was founded, it immediately led the work of the Socialist Youth League of China. The Socialist Youth League of China was later renamed the Communist Youth League of China, which played a significant role in the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars. In the late Second Revolutionary Civil War and the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the party's leadership, the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard Corps and the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard Corps were established. All these advanced youth forces of China have left a glorious legacy in the long and arduous revolutionary struggles. The Communist Youth League of China is advancing the cause of all these advanced youth forces of China under the party's cultivation.

In January 1949, the people's revolutionary high tide swept the nation, and the People's Liberation War was nearing its final victory. Our party, in order to unite and educate an entire generation of youth and to better mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of Chinese youth in revolutionary struggles and national construction, issued a resolution on the establishment of the Communist Youth League of China and dispatched a large number of young cadres to begin building the league's organizations nationwide. In April of the same year, the Communist Youth League of China held its first national congress. Chairman Mao gave instructions to the congress, urging the league to "lead various young people together, guide them, strengthen their studies, and develop production." The Central Committee sent a congratulatory message stating: "Past and present experiences have proven that the league is a valuable assistant and reserve force of the party. We believe that the Communist Youth League of China, with a broad foundation and good leadership, will be able to unite all patriotic laboring and intellectual youth in the great task of building a new China, spread Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among the youth, and lead the youth with the spirit of a shock brigade under the leadership of the party and the state to bravely fulfill their missions."

Following the guidance of the party and Chairman Mao, over the past four years, our league has united the youth of the nation, carrying forward the spirit of bravery and loyalty to the motherland and the people, standing at the forefront of the struggle.

After the first national congress of the league, the young soldiers and league members in the People's Liberation Army displayed unparalleled heroism in the battles to sweep away the remaining Kuomintang bandits. In the liberated areas, the league organizations mobilized all league members and the broad masses of youth to strive for production and actively participate in social reforms, providing manpower and materials to support the war of liberation. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, various advanced youth organizations united the broad masses of youth around the Communist Party of China, consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front, and engaging in struggles to protect factories, schools, and welcome liberation. In the newly liberated areas, the league actively assisted the People's Liberation Army and the people's government in taking over, conducting propaganda and education activities among the masses, and playing an active role in the rapid stabilization of revolutionary social order and the rapid recovery of production.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, we united the youth of the nation and actively participated in a series of democratic reform tasks. We mobilized tens of thousands of intellectual youth to work in rural areas and mobilized the vast majority of rural youth to actively participate in the great land reform movement. We educated rural youth to enthusiastically join the militia, using their own strength to defend the fruits of their liberation. League members became the backbone of the militia. In the struggles to suppress counter-revolutionaries and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, we mobilized and organized millions of youth to expose many serious counter-revolutionaries, expose the illegal activities of corrupt elements and law-breaking capitalists. Due to the education of these great struggles, the political awareness of the broad masses of league members and Chinese youth has been greatly enhanced.

In the task of restoring and developing the national economy, we have done tremendous work. Our league, responding to Chairman Mao's call to "strengthen studies and develop production," mobilized the broad masses of young workers in factories, mines, and enterprises to join the patriotic labor competition. Young workers learned a lot from experienced adult workers and engineering and technical personnel, actively seeking ways to tap potential, proposing rationalization suggestions, learning and promoting advanced experiences, and achieving great results. In rural areas, the league united the broad masses of youth to join the patriotic production increase movement and mutual aid and cooperation movement. Now, the vast majority of league members in rural areas participate in temporary and regular various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation organizations. Many league members have served as leaders in these mutual aid and cooperation organizations. We united the broad masses of youth to strive for the great task of restoring transportation and developing water conservancy, such as in the great Huai River project, where more than two million youth participated. Due to the active labor of our people and youth, the vast majority of industrial and agricultural products in our country have exceeded the highest production levels before the war of resistance. In the struggle to develop production, the ability of Chinese youth to build the country has been greatly enhanced. Countless youth have become production experts, and nearly 30,000 league members and young workers have been promoted to engineering and technical or administrative management cadres. Last year alone, more than ten thousand labor models, advanced producers, and model workers emerged among the youth and league members.

The youth and intellectual youth of New China are eager for progress in thought and politics. Under the leadership of the party, the league united the broad masses of youth students and intellectual youth to participate in the ideological reform movement of intellectuals, quickly eliminating the influence of imperialism and feudalism among the broad masses of youth, and enhancing patriotism and internationalism.

When American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and threatened our country's security, our people launched the great struggle to aid Korea and resist America. The broad masses of youth responded to the motherland's call, enthusiastically volunteering to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and military schools. Now, more than 60% of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are youth. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is guarding our sacred borders, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting against American aggressors on the Korean battlefield, achieving great feats. In the great struggle to aid Korea and resist America, Chinese youth have made significant contributions to defending the motherland and defending peace in the Far East and the world.

In participating in the various great struggles to transform society, the youth have also transformed themselves, continuously enhancing their awareness and organizational level. Under the care and guidance of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and through the great revolutionary struggles, the new moral qualities of Chinese youth have rapidly formed. These new moral qualities are: having a high sense of patriotism and internationalism, regarding serving the motherland and the people as the greatest happiness; loving labor and actively acquiring new knowledge; having the greatest courage, being able to overcome any difficulty; having a high sense of principle, being good at caring for and helping the masses, and bravely fighting against the enemies of the people without compromise, and when necessary, sacrificing one's life for the cause. In the past four years, countless such heroes have emerged among Chinese youth in battles, production, and work. Some comrades have already heroically sacrificed their lives, such as Huang Jiguang, who, despite being wounded seven times, finally used his chest to block the enemy's gun barrel, allowing our counterattacking forces to annihilate more than 1,200 enemy soldiers; Qiu Shaoyun, who heroically sacrificed his life while covering for his comrades to complete the mission without revealing the target; Luo Shengjiao, who heroically sacrificed his life while rescuing a Korean boy from an icy river; Liu Xingwen, a member of the Miao ethnic group, who heroically sacrificed his life after defending the position for two days and repelling more than ten enemy attacks; Ding Youjun, who, while fighting against Kuomintang bandits, was captured and heroically sacrificed her life while shouting "Long live Chairman Mao"; Shi Xinmin, a primary school teacher who sacrificed his life while rescuing students from a flood; Peng Da, who heroically sacrificed his life while protecting state property and rescuing comrades in a struggle with spies; Ma Xingfu, a Hui youth who sacrificed his life while fighting a forest fire to protect the country's forests. They and many other heroic youth are outstanding representatives of the heroes of New China's youth. These comrades are truly excellent children of Mao Zedong's education. They are shining examples of Chinese youth. We will forever remember them, and their heroic deeds will forever inspire Chinese youth to press forward.

The broad masses of league members, through four years of great struggles and participating in the party's rectification study, have further enhanced their political awareness. In the past four years, more than 500,000 league members have joined the glorious Communist Party of China.

Now, the league has developed into a national organization of advanced youth, with more than 9 million members and 380,000 grassroots organizations. The league has taken root among the youth masses of the nation and has become an important shock force for consolidating our people's democratic dictatorship and building the motherland.

The experience of the past four years tells us that the league's adherence to the party's leadership is of decisive significance to the league's work. All our achievements in the past few years have been made under the direct leadership of the party. The party has given the league immeasurable strength. Without relying on the party's leadership, none of the league's work can be done well. However, relying on the party's leadership does not mean that we do not need the league's systematic work, nor does it mean mechanically copying all the party's work methods. Instead, we should establish the league's independent activities under the party's leadership, based on the characteristics of youth, and use methods suitable for youth to unite the broad masses of youth to follow the party forward. Second, we have been able to achieve the above-mentioned work achievements because we have mobilized and united the broad masses of youth to strive for the central tasks proposed by the party and the people's government in various periods. The tasks proposed by the party and the people's government for all the people in various periods represent the greatest interests of all the people at that time. The league must strive to realize the central tasks of the party and the people's government to effectively unite and educate the broad masses of youth and play the role of a shock brigade in various tasks. Of course, this does not mean that the league, in addition to participating in the central tasks, does not need to do the work that youth specifically need among the youth masses. Precisely because of the need to unite and educate youth to better participate in the work of the party and the people's government, the league should fully pay attention to the special needs of youth and organize youth's learning and cultural, recreational, and sports activities, as well as regularly care for youth's life and rest. Third, the league's work must be guided by the educational viewpoint. Our league members and the broad masses of youth are full of revolutionary enthusiasm and have high initiative in various struggles, but their weakness is the lack of knowledge and experience. To make them play a greater role in national construction, to cultivate them into active and conscious defenders and builders of the motherland, we must guide youth to learn Marxism-Leninism and the party's policies and guidelines in various struggles, learn science and technology and culture. If we only know how to use them without educating them, we will not only fail to fully mobilize the youth's strength but also prevent them from developing healthily. Fourth, when the league works among the broad masses of youth, it should, based on the fact that youth are still in the process of physical and psychological development, on the one hand, educate youth with the spirit of principle, cultivate youth's organizational and disciplinary awareness, and on the other hand, adopt the methods and styles of persuasion, exemplary demonstration, and lively and vivid activities to cultivate youth's good personality, and develop their initiative and various talents. Only in this way can we better unite the broad masses of youth, make them full of vitality, healthy and happy, and full of courage and creativity. Fifth, we must always maintain close ties with the masses and advance together with the broad masses. Our league, whether in the past, present, or future, is only a part of the youth masses. On the one hand, our league is not living on a youth island; it is connected with adults everywhere, connected with various production organizations, and connected with scattered family units. Therefore, when the league does its work, it must not only face the broad masses of league members but also face the broad masses of youth, and it must also be good at cooperating with adults, learning from adults, and obtaining the support and help of adults.

Comrades, in the past few years, our work has achieved results, and we have accumulated a lot of experience. However, we cannot be complacent; we still have shortcomings. From a national perspective, the main shortcomings of our work lie in the inability to work based on the characteristics of youth, and our work is often generalized. Therefore, we still cannot more broadly connect with the masses and often limit our work to a small circle of activists. From the inspection of the Central Committee of the league, in the past, the understanding of the situation and the reflection of the demands of the youth masses were not enough, and the specific guidance and help from above were not enough. We must carry forward our advantages, overcome our shortcomings, and seriously improve our work to meet the new tasks given by the party and the new period of national construction.

II.

Comrades! Our country's first five-year plan for economic construction has begun this year. Our party and Chairman Mao have put forward a new historical task for the people of the nation, which is to struggle for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the gradual transition to a socialist society. Chairman Mao said: "Without industry, there can be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." To realize the industrialization of our country, we must establish a strong industry in our country in a planned way, first concentrate on building heavy industry, and gradually transform agriculture, making our country transition from an agricultural country to an industrial country.

We all understand that this is a new, great, and glorious historical task, but it is also a more complex and arduous historical task. To complete this task, we need the people of the nation, as Chairman Mao teaches, to "work bravely and diligently, create our own civilization and happiness, and at the same time promote world peace and freedom." To complete this task, our country needs to cultivate tens of thousands of people who are loyal to the people's cause and have modern scientific and technological knowledge.

The more than 18% of the total population of China, who are between the ages of 14 and 25, are a great force of our motherland; the youth are full of boundless wisdom and are the main source of cultivating and building talents for our country.

At the third plenary session of the first Central Committee of the league held in August 1952, the Central Committee of the party and Chairman Mao called on the youth of the nation to actively participate in the construction of the motherland and stand at the forefront of the construction of the motherland. Chairman Mao pointed out that Chinese youth are brave and active, and this bravery and activism are the boundless power to build the motherland. However, having only this bravery and activism is not enough to build our country well; to build our country, we must learn more knowledge.

Therefore, in the new construction period, our league should, under the leadership of the party and the guidance of Chairman Mao, inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of the Chinese youth movement, unite the youth of all ethnic groups in the nation to build the motherland with selfless dedication, and strive to learn to build the motherland. In the great struggle to build the motherland, assist the party in educating league members and youth with the spirit of communism, making them a generation of young people who love the motherland, are loyal to the people, have knowledge, observe discipline, are brave and diligent, full of vitality, and fear no difficulties. Following the direction indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao, strive for the gradual realization of national industrialization and the gradual transition to a socialist society. This is our glorious and great task.

Now, I will explain the tasks of the league on various fronts.

First, regarding the tasks of the league on the industrial front.

Industrial construction is the core of our country's economic construction. With the development of industry, more and more Chinese youth will join the great ranks of the working class and become a powerful reserve force for our country's industrial construction. The party's general policy for the workers' movement is to mobilize the broad masses of workers to the greatest extent, fully mobilize their enthusiasm and creativity, strive to complete and overfulfill the state's economic plan, strive to improve labor productivity, improve product quality, strictly save and reduce costs, and on the basis of increasing production, gradually improve the material and cultural living standards of workers according to necessity and possibility. All activities of the league in factories, mines, transportation, and basic construction departments must serve this general policy.

To realize this policy, the league organizations in factories, mines, enterprises, and basic construction departments should, under the leadership of the party, closely cooperate with the trade unions, mobilize league members to unite all young workers to actively participate in labor competitions. League members should become active participants in labor competitions. League leaders must go deep into workshops, teams, and construction sites, maintain close contact with the broad masses of youth, regularly understand their work situation and thoughts and emotions, help them solve difficult problems, arouse their awareness, set advanced but feasible personal guarantee conditions, and turn the state's plan into their specific struggle goals. In labor competitions, many young advanced producers have already emerged and will continue to emerge. They use brave spirits to overcome all difficulties, use creative labor to break old technical quotas, create new quotas, and propose various rationalization suggestions. Our responsibility is to timely discover, support, and cultivate them. We should cultivate a respectful atmosphere for advanced figures among the broad masses of young workers, making everyone learn from their patriotic labor attitudes and advanced experiences. Only in this way can we effectively educate the broad masses of young workers to love labor and promote the intermediate and backward parts of youth to catch up with the advanced level. In labor competitions, we must also pay attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of young engineering and technical personnel and young staff, helping them to closely cooperate with workers, and jointly improve production.

The league should pay special attention to consolidating labor discipline in factories, mines, enterprises, and basic construction departments. Any relaxation of labor discipline and behavior that does not cherish public property not only affects the completion of production plans but also hinders the growth of young workers' communist consciousness and morality. The league should, under the leadership of the party, regularly educate league members and young workers to observe labor discipline and cherish state property, and criticize and struggle against those who violate labor discipline appropriately. This is an important task to mobilize the enthusiasm of youth and educate youth.

Organizing young workers to master technology and learn culture, cultivating them to become skilled workers as soon as possible, is an urgent need of the state and a strong desire of young workers. We should organize them to learn technology in actual operations; at the same time, we should, based on the needs of production development and the technical and cultural level of young workers, organize them to participate in various technical and cultural learning organizations in their spare time. The league organizations should regularly understand the learning situation of youth's technology and culture, help them solve learning difficulties, encourage them to strive to learn for the construction of the motherland; we should educate young workers to humbly learn from masters, adult workers, and technical personnel, and make every young person understand that not respecting those with knowledge and experience will block their own path to progress.

We should also do a good job of the work of young shop assistants in state stores and cooperatives, educating them to better serve production, consumers, and members, continuously improve their business proficiency, and strive to complete the state's procurement and sales plans; various levels of league organizations should also pay attention to strengthening the work of the league in private enterprises.

Caring for the living and welfare of young workers is our constant responsibility. The league organizations must educate young workers to strictly observe the safety regulations in production, actively support the necessary and possible suggestions and measures to improve labor and living conditions. The league organizations should also educate youth to correctly treat their own lives, advocate sports, and make full use of clubs and cultural palaces to carry out mass cultural and recreational activities.

Second, regarding the tasks of the league on the agricultural front.

Our motherland, while developing industrial production, must continuously further improve the level of agricultural production. The party instructs us: "In the high tide of industrial construction, any view that neglects agricultural production is one-sided and wrong." "We must seriously do agricultural production. In rural areas, the most important work is agricultural production, and other work is to serve it." "We should guide farmers to gradually organize various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit." Based on the tasks proposed by the party, we should further mobilize more than 5 million league members in rural areas, unite the broad masses of rural youth to produce more grain and industrial raw materials, and struggle to further improve the lives of farmers.

To achieve this goal, all rural league organizations should take agricultural production as the center of all their work, mobilize young farmers to actively participate in the patriotic production increase movement; under the leadership of the party, regularly discuss the problems of youth in production, and for all matters that are conducive to production, such as water conservancy construction, variety improvement, cultivation technology improvement, drought and flood prevention, and pest and disease prevention, we should mobilize youth to actively participate; for all matters that hinder production, we should timely stop and resolutely oppose them. We should educate league members to devote themselves to agricultural production and love agricultural labor, making everyone understand the importance of agricultural production in the national economy. Every rural league member should do a good job in agricultural production and influence and promote other youth with their actual actions.

Rural league organizations should educate league members to understand and correctly implement the party's policy of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. On the one hand, we should propagate to families and the broad masses that mutual aid and cooperation is the necessary path for farmers to live prosperously and rise together, and organize voluntarily; on the other hand, we should always remember that in promoting agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, we should consider the characteristics of small-scale farming, consider individual farmers, guide everyone to gradually advance, and not be impatient and rash. For league members who have joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations, we should educate them to strictly observe the instructions of the Central Committee of the party: "Communist Party members and league members should set an example in implementing the principles of mutual aid and cooperation, active production, and observing discipline, and should not take any undue advantage in mutual aid groups and cooperatives."

Rural league organizations should organize league members and youth to start from the actual situation and possible conditions of the locality, strive to learn agricultural technology, humbly learn from local experienced farmers and labor models about production experience and experience in overcoming natural disasters. Based on the principles of voluntariness and not hindering production, organize league members and youth to participate in literacy classes and literacy groups, learn culture and scientific knowledge, and carry out cultural and recreational activities suitable for rural conditions.

Third, regarding the tasks of the league in schools.

The league has more than 1.3 million members in schools, and the league has become the core of the party uniting the broad masses of students. We should, under the party and government's policy of "rectifying and consolidating, focusing on development, improving quality, and steadily advancing," assist the party and the people's government in doing a good job in school work, cultivating the broad masses of students to become all-around talents with both virtue and talent and a healthy physique.

To achieve this goal, school league organizations should first educate league members to observe school discipline, complete teaching plans, and strive to study well, influencing and helping classmates to study with their actual actions. Second, in learning, we should advocate developing students' ability to think freely and the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and for different understandings among students, we should have full discussions, clarify the truth, seek progress, and help them truly master knowledge and cultivate the spirit of pursuing truth. Third, under the unified plan of the school and without hindering normal learning, we should unite students to voluntarily participate in necessary social activities and public welfare work related to the school, cultivating everyone's quality of working for public affairs and connecting with the masses. School league organizations should also regularly care for students' physical health, assist the school in carrying out sports and cultural activities, making every student get appropriate rest and necessary physical training.

Our league should respect, care for, and help teachers' work. Currently, a considerable number of young teachers are in schools at all levels, and they are the new force in educational work. Young league members among teachers should unite other young teachers and the broad masses of adult teachers to play an active role in teaching work.

In the embrace of our great motherland, several million young children are growing up. They are the successors of the great revolutionary and construction cause of the Chinese people. The party and the people's government want to cultivate them into a new generation with both physical and mental health, the builders of the new life in the future. Our league, entrusted by the party, has established the organization of the Young Pioneers, which now has 7 million members. This organization plays a good role in cultivating the patriotism of young children, enhancing their interest in learning, inspiring their love for labor, and cultivating their initiative and discipline. Considering the nature of the Young Pioneers and the wishes of the members, the party has decided to rename the Young Pioneers as the Young Vanguard. We should strengthen our help and leadership for the Young Vanguard. We should care for young children like brothers and sisters. Currently, some activities of young children still have phenomena that are not suitable for young children, making them bear too many social tasks, which should be corrected. For the serious and evil phenomena that harm the physical and mental health of children left over from the old society, we should take effective measures to criticize and struggle. In the great cause of cultivating young children, teachers and counselors bear the glorious responsibility. They should continuously improve their work, based on the physical and psychological conditions of young children, patiently enrich young children's knowledge, and set a good example for them with their exemplary behavior, cultivating young children into a new generation with noble moral qualities. The league organizations should care for the work of primary school teachers and counselors, support and commend their achievements, and help meet their reasonable demands.

Fourth, regarding the tasks of the league in state organs and people's organizations.

Among the staff of state organs and people's organizations, nearly half are young people and one million league members. Although their positions are different, their work is all part of the glorious labor of building a great motherland. The responsibility of the league organizations is to educate league members to unite all young workers, love their work, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, continuously improve their theoretical, policy, and professional levels, cultivate good organizational and disciplinary awareness, accurately complete work tasks, actively participate in public life, carry forward the style of clean, simple, and people-oriented work, and wholeheartedly serve the interests of the masses.

Our country's advanced literature and art creation are powerful weapons for educating youth to struggle for the construction of the motherland. Chinese youth love excellent literary and artistic works, and they draw strength from these works. We hope that literary and artistic workers will more vividly reflect the great reality of our country, more vividly depict the images of heroes who defend and build the motherland, and deeply describe the greatness of our party. League members on the literary and artistic front should strive to study Marxism-Leninism, study Marxism-Leninism's theory of literature and art, study Comrade Mao Zedong's outstanding work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and at the same time, should go deep among the masses, making their works have higher ideological and artistic levels.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 1st.

Sports are an effective means to enhance the health of young people, cultivate a strong, brave, and tenacious generation of builders and defenders of the motherland. Young people need to acquire knowledge and build their bodies; therefore, they must not only strive to study diligently but also to exercise vigorously. At the same time, sports are one of the most popular cultural activities among young people, enriching and energizing their lives. Therefore, the Youth League must mobilize and organize young people to participate in various sports activities and competitions, assist and support sports organizations in carrying out mass sports activities.

Fifth, regarding the tasks of the Youth League in strengthening the united front of young people.

In the face of the great and arduous task of national construction, we must further broaden the unity of young people across the country and fully play their role in various positions of national construction. The broad united front of Chinese youth is a component of the people's democratic united front in our country. It is based on the working youth and revolutionary intellectual youth, uniting the youth of the entire country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, together with the people of the entire country, striving to gradually realize national industrialization and gradually transition to socialism. The Youth League must better learn and implement the party's united front policy, overcome the current shortcomings of insufficient contact with young people from various ethnic groups, young people from the business community, religious youth, young scientific and technological workers, and other unorganized young people in society. The Youth League should strongly support the work of the Democratic Youth Federation.

Our great motherland is a multi-ethnic country. We must further strengthen youth work in various ethnic minority areas. We must pay great attention to cultivating young cadres from various ethnic minorities, understand the characteristics of various ethnic minorities and the forms of activities that young people like, and combine the serious implementation of the party and government policies in ethnic minority areas. Continue to deepen patriotic education among young people of various ethnic minorities, unite and organize young people of all ethnic groups more broadly, and on this basis, carefully establish and develop Youth League organizations.

Now, an unprecedented election movement in our country's history has begun. This will further consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front. The Youth League organization should unite young people from all ethnic groups, classes, parties, and religious beliefs across the country to actively participate in the national election movement, support those who are loyal to the people and the country, closely connected with the masses, and have prestige among the people of various classes as representatives of the people. At the same time, representatives who are closely connected with the youth masses, care about the interests of the people and the immediate needs of the youth, and are supported by the youth should be elected to participate in various levels of the People's Congress to better play the role of youth in national political construction.

Sixth, regarding the tasks of the Youth League in national defense construction.

To ensure the security of our great motherland and lasting peace in the world, our country is continuing to strengthen national defense construction. The glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are at the forefront of defending the motherland, the guardians of our country's smooth progress in construction. The youth of the entire country hold them in deep respect and love. We must continue to learn from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, using their heroic deeds to continuously strengthen the youth's resolute will to defend the motherland. We must continue to strengthen work in the militia. The Youth League in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the party's education, has made outstanding contributions to the motherland. They are models for Youth League organizations across the country. The young soldiers and youth league members of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army must continue to strive, continuously improve their political level, model themselves on discipline, study military technology, improve culture, strengthen physical training, and strive to build a modern national defense army and defend our great motherland. Defending our great motherland is defending our happy life and defending a better future. We Chinese youth must bravely shoulder this sacred responsibility.

Seventh, regarding the tasks of Chinese youth in international affairs.

The Youth League has inherited the internationalist tradition since the founding of the Chinese Socialist Youth League, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on uniting international friends, and unremittingly strengthening the international unity of young people who love peace. We consolidate the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union and defend peace in the Far East and the world. Chinese youth have always been loyal supporters of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and actively participate in various activities organized by it. We have warmly welcomed the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to visit China. We are actively preparing to participate in the upcoming Third World Youth Congress and the Fourth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, and we believe that through these activities, we will make significant contributions to the struggle to unite young people around the world to defend peace and strive for a better future. In the past four years, Chinese youth have increasingly strengthened friendship with young people from various countries. We have warmly welcomed the Soviet Youth Delegation and Soviet Youth Artists to visit and perform in China and have sent youth delegations and student delegations to visit the Soviet Union. Our youth representatives have visited various people's democratic countries to attend their youth congresses or youth conferences. Our youth deeply care about and sympathize with the situation of young people in capitalist countries and colonies and dependent countries today. We have supported and will continue to support their arduous struggle. Now we have established contacts with more than 100 youth organizations in 60 countries. Our youth representatives have visited 20 countries for visits or meetings, and we have successively invited and received representatives from 45 countries to visit and tour China. All these activities have greatly strengthened the friendship and unity between Chinese youth and young people from various countries in the struggle to defend world peace.

The great achievements of New China are inseparable from international aid. We are grateful to the great ally, the Soviet Union, for its generous and selfless aid, and to the people's democratic countries for their enthusiastic support, and to all the people of the world who love peace and democracy for their support of us. To build our country, Chairman Mao has called on the people of the entire country to learn from the Soviet Union. We should better promote the movement to learn from the Soviet Union among all league members and youth across the country. The glorious Lenin Young Communist League of the Soviet Union is always our model, and we must strive to learn from them. We must use all means to consolidate the greatest friendship between the peoples and youth of China and the Soviet Union.

Comrades! We have explained the overall tasks of the Youth League in the construction period and the specific tasks on various fronts. To complete these tasks, we must further solve a common problem for young people on all fronts—the problem of combining study and work.

It should be said that under the leadership of the party and Chairman Mao, Chinese youth have been diligent in studying, and there have been achievements. In our ranks, millions of heroes and models have emerged. They are able to contribute more to the people because they are good at learning and good at combining study and work. The enemy of study is self-satisfaction, especially in the new construction period, to work better, we must study even harder. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the First National Congress of the League on the study issue has received the enthusiastic support of league organizations, all league members, and the broad masses of young people across the country. Now, according to the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the First National Congress of the League, we will further discuss and solve the issue of how to study and how to combine study and work.

The need to study is something everyone agrees on, because practical life has given us good education. Without study, we cannot become the true assistants of the party in these new historical conditions, cannot serve the construction of the motherland well, our work cannot advance, and we will become laggards of the times. However, there are many different questions and interpretations on what to study and how to study, and many views are often isolated and one-sided, and therefore wrong.

When it comes to the issue of study, any league member should study the communist worldview and communist morality. This worldview and morality is the worldview and morality of serving the people, which is Marxism-Leninism. On this issue, our great teacher Lenin, as early as 1920, explained it in his famous speech "The Tasks of the Young Communist League." He said: "To be a member of the Young Communist League is to use one's work and abilities to serve the public cause. This is the essence of communist education. Only in such work can young men and women be cultivated into true communists. Only when they can achieve actual results in such work will they become communists."

In his speech, Lenin, when talking about the issue of electrifying the entire Soviet Union, said: "Even if you are only 14 or 15 years old now, but after 10 or 20 years, you will live in a communist society. This generation should set their entire learning task so that every young person in any village or city can actually solve some tasks in public labor, no matter how small or ordinary the tasks are."

We must understand the spirit of Lenin's teachings. Any member of the Youth League cannot be satisfied with a superficial understanding of communist knowledge. Moreover, we must understand that knowing some general knowledge of communism is far from enough. The great edifice of communism is built by people working together in various aspects and through hard and meticulous labor. Therefore, those who participate in building this edifice must strive to master various specialized knowledge in their work positions to be able to contribute their greatest abilities in actual work; otherwise, they may become empty-talking "communists," and such empty-talking people are of no use to the people's cause.

Cultivating a true communist worldview and morality will promote the progress of learning specialized knowledge and specialized skills. And becoming proficient in specialized knowledge and specialized skills will also be able to make a certain and real contribution to the struggle to realize the communist cause. Both having a communist worldview and morality and being proficient in business are our requirements for all young people and league members regarding the issue of study; and in daily life, under the leadership of the party, cultivating the communist worldview and morality of young people and league members is of great significance.

We must also persuade those league members and young people who are not content with their work and study positions. Some rural young people and league members are not content with agricultural production, thinking that agricultural production has no future, and they have no interest in learning about agricultural production work and technology. In factories, some young workers and league members are not content with their work, for example, some young people in light industry want to transfer to heavy industry, and some young people doing foundry work want to be machinists. This hinders the learning of technology. In schools, many young people and league members think that to study, one must study heavy industry, and they have no interest in learning about agriculture, politics and law, or teacher training schools. They even think that learning to build sewers is not a construction job and is not worth studying. Obviously, all these views are wrong. Our motherland's construction cause needs work in various aspects and knowledge in various aspects, so every part of the work is indispensable to our entire cause and is interdependent. Our society cannot have only industry and no agriculture, nor can it have only economic construction and no political and cultural construction. All beneficial labor is a glorious cause, and we should love our positions. As long as one is dedicated and strives for excellence in one's work, one can develop one's abilities and achieve what predecessors have not achieved, thereby benefiting society.

There are also some wrong views on the issue of study. For example, some seem to think that to study is only to study culture; some seem to think that to study is only to study technology; some think that only going to school or training classes counts as studying; some think that it is difficult to study in work, even impossible to study; some in specific work positions relax work while emphasizing study; some in schools overemphasize social and extracurricular activities while relaxing basic coursework; some think that since leading study is the central task of the league, the league has no other work to do. In summary, the errors of these views are to separate the study of technology from the study of culture and to oppose work and study.

Improving culture and improving technology are interrelated, and learning culture is a necessary tool for learning higher technology. These points do not need to be elaborated. It should be pointed out that, according to possible conditions, gradually learning culture and obtaining more from it is something that every league member and all young people should strive for. As for technology, in general, in work, one should "study what one does," that is, according to the specific work conditions and specific learning requirements of young workers, young peasants, and young people in various different work positions, determine their learning content and steps to continuously improve their skills and do a good job in work and production. If one does not distinguish the requirements of different young people and organizes learning in a general and chaotic manner, it will be "off-topic" and will not achieve good results.

With the development of our motherland's construction, our various schools and training classes will inevitably develop. This is undoubted. However, if one thinks that one can only study in schools and training classes, this view is very wrong. In fact, our work of serving the people has no end, and our knowledge also has no end, so our study also has no end. Studying in schools and training classes, for our entire learning process, is only one way, one aspect, one stage, and the maturity of a certain knowledge must rely on long-term cultivation and accumulation in production, work, and struggle. In production, work, and struggle, as long as one pays attention, one can learn a lot. "Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning." This is what Chairman Mao told us, and the fact is indeed so.

How do we study in production, work, and struggle? This is to constantly study Marxism-Leninism, to be good at learning from the party, to be good at learning from experienced people, and to be good at learning from those around us. This is to be good at accepting and understanding advanced human experience and knowledge in production, work, and struggle, and to dare to conduct new experiments and new creations based on the experience of predecessors, others, and oneself. This is the method of "learning while doing and gradually improving." Using this method, work and study are unified. In this way, studying in work will not only not hinder work but will also promote the progress of work. Using this method, that is, one must be humble and patient, not be satisfied with oneself, and in learning, to truly see results, one must be prepared to learn for a long time and patiently. Now, some comrades do not fully understand the laws and difficulties of learning, and in learning, they have contracted "acute disease," wanting to quickly learn many things, aiming high but not achieving much, and being impatient for success. Although this active enthusiasm is very valuable, not understanding the principle of gradual progress, the result is "haste makes waste," and when their attempts cannot be realized, they become discouraged. This phenomenon should be avoided.

It should be pointed out that league members in various work positions must also seriously implement the party and league's policy of combining work and study, and strive to study in work. If league members do not first study hard themselves but instead point fingers and call on others, the result will be "saying one thing and doing another, all talk and no action," which will only invite criticism from all sides, and this situation should be avoided.

Four

Comrades! In the past four years, we have followed the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to establish and develop league organizations in close conjunction with the central tasks of the party and the state in various periods. Now, the league organization has developed greatly, with league members increasing from 190,000 at the First National Congress to 9 million. We have built a national-level youth league with a broad mass base. The youth league has grown and strengthened under the party's care and nurturing in the past four years. Most of our league members are good, and they are brave in various struggles and active in various work. This is the basic situation of the league organization. However, because our organization has developed so greatly in a short period, and in the process of development, our educational and organizational work has not been done well enough, there are still many shortcomings in the league organization. These shortcomings are manifested in: some places pursue numbers when developing league members, lowering standards, resulting in some league members not meeting the conditions for league membership, and even some bad elements infiltrating the league; some league members, after joining the league, are not promptly organized into branches to participate in league life and receive education; some branches are still in a scattered state and do not function; although the vast majority of league members and league cadres have undergone a certain amount of work tempering, generally, they have not received enough ideological education and organizational training, and their experience is insufficient. In work, many cadres still do not know how to lead league members to play their role correctly, do not know how to adopt lively and vibrant methods that young people like to work according to the characteristics of young people, and do not understand that the style of the youth league should be both serious and lively, both opposing frivolity and opposing dullness and dryness. If we require young people in the same way as we require adults, we will definitely deviate from reality and deviate from the masses.

To adapt to the changing situation and tasks, to solve the problems existing in the league organization, our organizational work must adopt the policy of consolidating and developing forward in the next period. If, in the past, when most of the country did not have league organizations and advanced young people urgently needed to join the league, we followed the league constitution's conditions for joining the league and adopted the policy of relatively rapid development, this was correct and necessary; then, now that league organizations have been established in various aspects and some league organizations need to be organized and consolidated, we should adopt the policy of consolidating and developing forward in organizational work. Consolidating and developing forward is not stopping development. Because the development of our league is unbalanced at present, some places still do not have league organizations, and some units still have very few league members, such as most basic construction units, some factories, mines, and some state farms. In those places where there are no league organizations or where league organizations are small, we must continue to develop league organizations. Even in places where the number of league members is already large compared to the proportion of young people, we should still absorb those advanced young people who meet the conditions for joining the league and voluntarily apply to join the league.

How to consolidate the league organization? We must consolidate it in terms of ideology, politics, and organization, that is, we must strengthen the education of league members, vigorously cultivate cadres, strengthen grassroots organizations, enhance the organizational and disciplinary nature of the league, and organize and consolidate some scattered organizations.

We should do a good job in the league's educational work, continuously use the spirit of communism, the party's policies, the laws and orders of the people's government, and the conditions for being a league member to educate the broad masses of league members, improve the awareness of the broad masses of league members, enhance the fighting capacity of the youth league, so that league members not only have specialized business skills and scientific knowledge but also cultivate good moral qualities, are good at subordinating their personal interests to the overall interests of the state, are good at linking their daily work in different work positions with the great task of national construction, and are good at realizing the great task of national construction through their daily work. To achieve the above educational goals, the education of league members must be combined with the central tasks of the state and the party in each period and must be combined with the specific tasks of league members in different positions. We must continuously understand the ideological situation of league members and the actual problems of grassroots organizations, adopt in-depth and meticulous methods, and specifically help them solve problems. League cadres must seriously study the experience of league members in completing tasks in production, work, and study, grasp the good and bad examples among league members, and carry out discussions among league members, using praise and criticism, and the experience created by the masses of league members to educate league members. At the same time, to strengthen the educational work of the entire league, the entire league should pay more attention to the editing and publishing of party newspapers, league newspapers, league publications, and youth and adolescent reading materials. League classes have been effective in many places and should summarize successful experiences and, according to possible conditions, promote them.

We should strengthen and organize some grassroots organizations. In the past four years, we have established 380,000 grassroots organizations. In state organs, state-owned factories, mines, and enterprises, basic construction sites, relatively large private factories and shops, middle and higher schools, and more than 70% of villages and many streets across the country, there are already league organizations. In the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, league organizations have also developed greatly. In some ethnic minority areas, league organizations have also been established. League grassroots organizations scattered across various parts of the motherland and various work positions have generally played an active role in various democratic reforms and daily struggles and work. They have become a great force to attract and inspire young men and women of different occupations and ethnicities to unite and progress. However, many grassroots organizations in factories and villages are still accustomed to the methods of democratic reform movements and have not been able to shift their focus of activity to production with the development of national construction. Some grassroots organizations in schools have not taken learning as the center of their activities. Experience has proven: grassroots organizations that have correctly grasped and actually implemented their central tasks and have always paid attention to organizing some cultural and sports activities for young people and caring about young people's rest have content and vitality in their work, have the support of league members and the masses, and can consolidate and develop their organizations; on the contrary, their work lacks content, does not have the support of the masses, and cannot consolidate and develop their organizations. Therefore, the primary method to consolidate grassroots organizations is that various levels of league committees must, based on the party's central tasks and the specific situations of various league grassroots organizations, use the successful experiences of grassroots organizations that work well to establish their own regular work. For those grassroots organizations that lack regular organizational life and are in a state of slackness and dispersion, they should first be educated, and according to the actual situation, be organized and consolidated in a planned and step-by-step manner.

We should strengthen the organizational and disciplinary nature of the league and, from top to bottom, establish a healthy democratic life within the league. Experience has proven: only with a healthy democratic life can the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and league members be fully brought into play; only with a healthy democratic life can the organizational and disciplinary nature of the league be strengthened on a voluntary basis. We should strengthen the education of league members' organizational and disciplinary nature so that they can influence the broad masses of young people to execute the party's policies and abide by the state's laws and regulations. To ensure that the league organization has a normal democratic life, to overcome the shortcomings of some grassroots organizations not playing the role of league members in work and a few people monopolizing everything, in all grassroots organizations, regular meetings of all league members or league member representative meetings should be held to elect grassroots organization leaders, carry out criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, various levels of league committees should also appropriately and regularly hold some work meetings and regularly hold representative meetings or representative congresses, using this method of relying on the masses to summarize work and improve work. Because young people are in a period of growth and learning, we cannot demand too strict discipline for general young people and league members, not pay attention to cultivating the good individuality of league members and general young people, and not understand the need to adapt to the lively and vibrant style of young people. The tendency to use the method of "struggle" to deal with league members and general young people must be corrected.

We should strengthen the work of cultivating and training cadres, especially the educational work of grassroots cadres. In the past few years, we have successively opened 31 league schools across the country, training a large number of full-time cadres, and by last June, we had trained 550,000 grassroots cadres. It is precisely because the entire league, under the leadership of various levels of party committees, has paid attention to this issue, that new cadres have continuously emerged, enabling us to successfully adapt to the development of the work situation and also to recommend nearly 40,000 cadres at the district level and above and more than 1 million grassroots cadres to the party and government departments. With the development of revolutionary work and the arrival of the national construction period, we have the responsibility to cultivate more and better cadres. This means that we must cultivate a large number of new cadres who are loyal to the party and the people's cause and are full of vitality within the league organization. Because our motherland has entered a new construction period, and our league organization and the broad masses of league members are distributed in factories, mines, villages, schools, and government agencies in different departments, engaged in construction work in different aspects, this requires us to pay attention to cultivating cadres suitable for working in various different departments. So that our cadres not only are loyal to the party and the people's cause but also are familiar with the business of the department they are in, understand how to carry out league work according to the specific conditions of the department they are in, so that it is also possible to recommend more cadres to the party and the state to engage in construction work in various aspects. To achieve this requirement, in addition to making the league school better and more practical, the main thing is that various levels of league organizations should regularly give cadres specific guidance and help, especially guide them to seriously summarize work experience and actually organize them to learn in various aspects. At present, many grassroots organization cadres, especially new grassroots organization cadres, do not know how to do work. Various local league committees, in addition to training them in a planned manner, should pay special attention to going deep into the grassroots and patiently helping and educating them in work. To promote a large number of cadres, we must pay attention to discovering and cultivating new outstanding cadres and appropriately and boldly promote them to leadership positions in the league. According to the current situation of league cadres, we should pay special attention to cultivating outstanding elements among working and peasant youth and cultivating female youth cadres. In ethnic minority areas, we should pay attention to cultivating ethnic minority cadres. To correctly select and use cadres, we must overcome the tendency to understand cadres only from forms, reports, and even personal impressions, and must understand and recognize cadres from checking work and actually investigating their work situation through direct contact with working people. We must understand and recognize cadres not only from the leadership side but also from the side of those being led and the masses. In the work of cultivating and selecting cadres, the cultivation and selection of grassroots organization cadres should be particularly valued. The Youth League is the reserve army of the party and should recommend cadres to the party in a planned manner according to the needs of the party, and at the same time, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, "retain necessary cadres to be familiar with the work." Especially in one province or city, there should be two or three key counties, districts, and factory and mine leaders who are relatively stable for a long period to accumulate experience and cultivate new cadres.

We should strengthen and improve the leadership of various levels of league committees. The most reliable guarantee for this is that various levels of league committees must highly respect the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and various levels of party committees. We should always remember Comrade Stalin's instructions:

"The guarantee of party leadership is the most important and most significant thing in the entire work of the Communist Youth League." Therefore, on the one hand, the Youth League should not emphasize the special tasks of the league organization in isolation from the central tasks of various levels of party organizations, and overemphasize the vertical leadership of the league; on the other hand, to actually complete the tasks assigned by the party and the party committee at the same level to the league organization, so that the league truly becomes the party's close assistant in uniting and educating young people, various levels of league committees should systematically establish their own regular work under the supervision and guidance of the party committee, and should not abandon the league organization and give up the activities of the league in the broad masses of young people. If it is not like this, it will not be able to guarantee the party's leadership among young people. To strengthen and improve the leadership of various levels of league committees, we must also connect with reality, go deep into the grassroots, especially learn production knowledge, so as to gain the ability to lead young people to complete production tasks, solve the problems that young people raise in production, and improve the leadership level of the league.

Comrades! All our work is carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. All our achievements should be attributed to the glorious and great Communist Party of China and our great leader and teacher, Chairman Mao. The great Chairman Mao always cares about the growth of the communist qualities and construction abilities of our young generation. We will never disappoint the party and Chairman Mao's expectations. We will always be loyal to the party and loyal to the people's cause.

The great construction of our motherland has opened up an unlimited bright future for the people and youth of our country. We want to be active builders of New China. We want to be good children of the great Chinese people and the great Communist Party of China, contributing all our strength and wisdom to advance bravely in the great ranks of national construction.

Long live our dear great motherland!

Let Marxism-Leninism arm our minds!

Long live the great unity of all Chinese youth!

Long live the great unity of democratic youth around the world!

Long live the glorious and great Communist Party of China!

Long live our most beloved leader and teacher, the great Chairman Mao!

    团结全国青年在建设祖国的伟大行列中奋勇前进
    ——一九五三年六月二十四日在中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会上的工作报告
    胡耀邦亲爱的代表同志们，亲爱的朋友们：
    自从我们召开第一次全国代表大会到现在，已经四年多了。
    这四年，是我们祖国发生巨大变化的四年。伟大的中国共产党和毛主席，领导我国人民，最后地推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的罪恶统治，缔造了一个以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、真正统一的、独立的、人民民主的新国家，基本上完成了社会的民主改革，恢复和发展了国民经济，进行了伟大的抗美援朝斗争，有力地捍卫着远东和世界的和平。
    这些伟大的胜利，为我们祖国有计划的建设，铺平了广阔的道路。我国现在正进入一个逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会的新时期。
    我们的国家是这样大踏步地前进，全世界一切爱好和平和正义的人民莫不为我们欢欣鼓舞，一切反动派都胆颤心惊。世界上没有任何力量能够阻挡我国人民奔向新的更大的胜利。我们每个人对于祖国无限光明和无限美好的前途，充满着坚强的信心。
    是谁率领着我们从胜利走向胜利呢？这是光荣的伟大的中国共产党，是我们最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席。毛主席是我国人民一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者。中国人民有毛主席的领导，实在是极大的幸福，中国青年以生活在毛泽东的时代而感到自豪。
    在这次大会上，我们将回顾一下我们为祖国做了些什么，研究一下我们应该如何地回答在新时期中祖国对我们的希望。
    一
    同志们！现代中国的青年运动，一向是在中国共产党领导下发展的。中国共产党和毛主席从来就异常关怀中国青年运动。我们党和毛主席认为，五四运动以来，中国青年在我国革命斗争中是“一个重要的方面军”。党成立后，随即领导了中国社会主义青年团的工作。中国社会主义青年团后来改名为中国共产主义青年团，在第一次和第二次国内革命战争中，起了巨大的作用。在第二次国内革命战争末期和抗日战争中，在党的领导下成立了中华民族解放先锋队和青年抗日先锋队，中国青年的这一切先进部队，在长期的艰苦的革命斗争中，留下了它的光辉的业迹。中国新民主主义青年团就是在党的培养下，继承中国青年这一切先进部队的事业而前进的。
    一九四九年一月，人民革命高潮普及全国，中国人民解放战争接近了最后的胜利。我们的党，为着团结和教育整个青年一代，为着更大地发挥中国青年在革命斗争中和国家建设中的积极性与创造性，发布了关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议，并抽调了大批青年干部开始在全国范围内建立团的组织。同年四月，中国新民主主义青年团召开了第一次全国代表大会。毛主席给大会指示，要青年团
    “同各界青年一起，领导他们，加强学习，发展生产”。党中央在贺电中说：“过去和现在的经验都证明，青年团是党的有价值的助手和后备军。我们相信，有广泛基础和良好领导的新民主主义青年团，在今后建设新中国的伟大工作中，必能团结全体爱国的劳动青年和知识青年，在青年中传布马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，并以突击队的精神率领青年，在党和国家的领导之下，勇敢地完成自己的任务。”
    遵循着党和毛主席教导，四年来，我们青年团团结全国青年，发扬着忠于祖国忠于人民的英勇精神，站在斗争的前列。
    第一次全国团代表大会后，人民解放军中的青年战士和青年团员们，在扫荡残余蒋匪帮的战斗中，表现了无比的英雄气概。解放区的青年团组织，动员了全体团员和广大青年努力发展生产，积极参加社会改革，以人力物力支援解放全国的战争。在国民党统治区，各种先进青年组织团结了广大青年在中国共产党的周围，巩固与扩大了人民民主统一战线，进行了护厂、护校、迎接解放的斗争。在新解放区，青年团积极协助人民解放军和人民政府，进行了接管工作，在广大群众中展开了宣传教育的活动，对于革命的社会秩序的迅速安定和生产的迅速恢复，起了积极的作用。
    中华人民共和国成立后，我们团结全国青年，积极地参加了一系列的民主改革工作。我们动员了几十万知识青年深入农村工作，动员了绝大多数的农村青年积极地参加了伟大的土地改革运动，我们教育着农村青年踊跃地参加民兵，用自己的力量保卫翻身的果实。青年团员们成了民兵的骨干。在镇压反革命和“三反”“五反”的伟大斗争中，我们动员和组织了千千万万的青年检举了许多罪恶重大的反革命分子，检举了贪污分子和违法资本家的犯法行为。由于这些伟大斗争的教育，广大团员和中国青年的政治觉悟程度就大大地提高起来。
    在恢复和发展国民经济的事业中，我们进行了巨大的工作。我们青年团，响应毛主席关于“加强学习，发展生产”的号召，在工厂、矿山、企业中团结了广大青年职工投入爱国主义的劳动竞赛运动，青年工人从有经验的成年工人和工程技术人员那里学到了许多东西，他们积极地找窍门，挖潜力，提合理化建议，学习和推广先进经验，成绩很大。在农村中，青年团团结广大青年投入爱国增产运动和互助合作运动。现在，农村中绝大多数的青年团员，参加了临时的和经常的各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作的组织，不少的青年团员在这些互助合作的组织中作了领导骨干。我们团结广大青年努力地参加了恢复交通和发展水利的巨大工作，如在伟大的治淮工程中，先后就有两百多万青年参加。由于我国人民和青年们的积极劳动，使我国工农业的绝大多数产品都超过了抗战前的最高产量。在发展生产的斗争中，中国青年建设国家的本领大大地提高了。无数的青年成了生产能手，近三万团员和青年工人被提拔为工程技术干部或行政管理干部。去年一年，在青年和青年团员中就涌现了十多万名劳动模范、先进生产者和模范工作人员。
    新中国的青年学生和知识青年，迫切地要求思想上和政治上的进步。青年团在党领导下，团结了广大的青年学生和知识青年参加了知识分子的思想改造运动，在广大青年中迅速地清除了帝国主义、封建主义的思想影响，提高了爱国主义和国际主义的思想。
    当美帝国主义发动侵朝战争并威胁到我国安全的时候，我国人民掀起了伟大的抗美援朝斗争。广大青年响应了祖国的召唤，踊跃地要求参加中国人民志愿军和军事学校。现在，中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军中百分之六十以上是青年，中国人民解放军守护着我们神圣的边疆，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上与美国侵略者作战，立下了伟大的功勋。在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，中国青年对保卫祖国保卫远东和世界和平，作了重大的贡献。
    青年们在参加改造社会的各种伟大斗争中，同时也改造了自己，不断地提高着自己的觉悟程度和组织程度。在毛主席和中国共产党的关怀与教养下，在伟大革命斗争的锻炼中，中国青年的新的道德品质迅速地形成起来。这种新的道德品质是：有高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，把为祖国为人民服务当作自己的最大的幸福；热爱劳动，积极地获取新的知识；有最大的勇敢，能够克服任何困难；有高度的原则立场，既善于关心和帮助人民群众，又勇于和人民的敌人作不妥协的斗争，在必要的时候，就慷慨地献出自己的生命。四年来，中国青年在战场上，在生产中，在工作中，出现了成千成万这样的英雄人物。其中有些同志已英勇地牺牲了，像身受七处重伤，最后仍以自己的胸膛抵住敌人的枪眼，使我反击部队全歼敌人一千二百余名的英雄黄继光同志；像为了掩护战友完成战斗任务，坚守不暴露目标而壮烈牺牲的邱少云同志；像从冰河里奋勇抢救朝鲜少年而壮烈牺牲的伟大国际主义战士罗盛教同志；像坚持阵地两天，打退敌人十余次进攻而壮烈牺牲的苗族人民的优秀儿子刘兴文同志；像为了农民翻身，在剿灭国民党土匪中，不幸被俘而于壮烈就义时仍高呼毛主席万岁的祖国忠贞女儿丁佑君同志；像从洪水中拯救小学生而献出了自己生命的小学教员施新民同志；像为了保护国家财产、援救同志与特务匪徒搏斗而英勇牺牲的彭达同志；像为扑灭山火、维护祖国森林而牺牲的回族青年马兴富同志。他们以及其他许多英勇牺牲的青年，就是新中国青年英雄人物中著名的杰出代表。这些同志不愧是毛泽东教养出来的好儿女，他们是中国青年的光辉的典范。我们将永远地纪念他们，他们的英雄事迹将永远永远地鼓舞着中国青年奋勇向前。
    广大团员经过四年伟大斗争的锻炼，以及参加中国共产党整党的学习，他们的政治觉悟，有了进一步的提高。四年来，已有五十多万团员加入了光荣的中国共产党。
    现在，青年团已发展成了全国性的先进青年的组织，已有九百多万团员，三十八万个基层组织。青年团已在全国青年群众中生了根，它已成为巩固我国人民民主专政和建设祖国的一支重要的突击力量。
    四年来的经验告诉我们，青年团服从党的领导，对青年团工作有着决定的意义。我们几年来的一切工作成绩，都是在党的直接领导下取得的。党给青年团以不可估量的力量。如果不依靠党的领导，青年团的一切工作就都不能够搞好。但是依靠党的领导决不是不要团的系统工作了，也不是机械地抄袭党的一切工作方式，而应当在党的领导下建立青年团的独立的活动，以根据青年的特点，采用适合青年的方法团结广大青年群众跟着党前进。第二，我们能够获得上述的工作成绩，是由于我们动员全国并团结了广大青年为实现党和人民政府在各个时期提出的中心任务而奋斗。党和人民政府在各个时期对全体人民所提出的任务，代表着当时全体人民最大的利益，青年团必须为实现党和人民政府的中心任务奋斗，才能有力地团结和教育广大青年，发挥自己在各种工作中突击队的作用。当然，这不是说，青年团除参加中心工作外，就不需要在青年群众中进行青年所特殊需要的工作了。正是为了团结和教育青年更好地参加党和人民政府的工作，青年团应该充分注意青年的特殊要求，和组织青年的学习和文化、娱乐、体育等各种活动，以及经常关心青年的生活和休息。第三，青年团一切工作中必须贯彻教育观点。我们的团员和广大青年富有革命的热情，在各种斗争中有高度的积极性，但他们的弱点是缺乏知识和经验。为了使他们在国家建设中发挥更大的作用，为了把他们培养成为祖国的积极的自觉的保卫者和建设者，必须在各种斗争中引导青年学习马克思列宁主义和党的方针政策，学习科学技术和文化。如果只知使用，而不知教育，就不仅不能充分发挥青年力量，也会使他们得不到健全的发展。第四，青年团在广大青年中进行工作时，应根据青年在生理上心理上尚处在成长过程的特点，一方面要以原则精神教育青年，培养青年的组织性和纪律性，另一方面，要采取循循善诱、典型示范、生动活泼的方法和作风，培养青年优良的个性，发扬他们的进取心和各种才能。只有这样，才能更好地团结广大青年，使他们充满朝气，健康愉快，富于勇敢创造的精神。第五，我们必须随时密切联系群众，和广大群众共同前进。我们青年团不论过去、现在和今后，都只是青年群众中一部分，这是一方面的情形。我们青年团并不是生活在青年孤岛上，它处处和成年人联系着，和不同的生产组织联系着，和分散的家庭单位联系着，这是又一方面的情形。因而青年团在进行工作的时候，不仅要面向广大团员，而且要面向广大青年群众，而且还要善于和成年人合作，向成年人学习，取得成年人的赞同和帮助。
    同志们，几年来我们的工作是有成绩的，我们也积累了不少的经验。不过，我们不能自满，我们还有缺点，从全国来讲，我们工作的主要缺点，在于不善于根据青年的特点进行工作，我们工作往往一般化。因而还不能更加广泛地联系群众，往往把自己的工作限制在少数积极分子的圈子里。从团中央的领导检查，过去了解情况，反映青年群众要求不够，对下面具体指导帮助不够。我们必须发扬优点，克服缺点，认真地改进我们的工作，迎接党给我们的新任务，迎接祖国建设的新时期。
    二
    同志们！我国经济建设第一个五年计划已经从今年开始了。我们的党和毛主席向全国人民提出了新的历史任务，这就是为逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。毛主席说：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”实现我们国家的工业化，就是要有计划地建立起我国强大的工业，首先是集中力量建设重工业，并逐步改造农业，使我国由农业国变为工业国。
    我们每个人都懂得，这是一个新的伟大的光荣的历史任务，同时也是一个更加复杂更加艰巨的历史任务。要完成这个任务，就需要全国人民如毛主席所教导的那样：“以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，创造自己的文明和幸福，同时也促进世界的和平和自由。”要完成这个任务，我们的国家需要造就出成千成万忠实于人民事业的有现代科学技术的人材来。
    占全国总人口百分之十八以上的，年在十四周岁到二十五周岁的中国青年，是祖国一支巨大的力量；青年们蕴藏着无限的智慧，是我们国家培养建设人材的主要源泉。
    在一九五二年八月召开团的一届三中全会的时候，党中央和毛主席号召全国青年积极参加祖国的建设，站在祖国建设的前列。毛主席指出，中国青年是英勇积极的，这种英勇和积极性，乃是建设祖国的无限力量，但是光有这种英勇和积极性还不能建设好我们的国家；要建设我们的国家，还必须学习更多的知识。
    因而，在新的建设时期里，我们青年团要在党的领导下，在毛主席的教诲下，继承和发扬中国青年运动的优良传统，团结全国各族青年为建设祖国而忘我地劳动，为建设祖国而奋发地学习。在建设祖国的伟大斗争中，协助党以共产主义精神教育团员和青年，使他们成为热爱祖国、忠于人民、有知识、守纪律、勇敢勤劳、朝气蓬勃、不怕任何困难的年轻的一代，遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，为逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。这就是我们光荣的巨大的任务。
    现在，我来分别地说明青年团在各个战线上的任务。
    首先是关于青年团在工业战线上的任务。
    工业建设是我国经济建设的重心。而随着工业的发展，我国青年将越来越多地加入工人阶级的伟大行列，成为我国工业建设上一支强大的后备队。我们党的工人运动的总方针，是以最大的努力充分地发挥广大工人群众的积极性和创造性，为完成与超额完成国家的经济计划而奋斗，为提高劳动生产率，提高产品质量，严格节约和降低成本而奋斗，并在增加生产的基础上，按照必要与可能逐步提高工人的物质与文化生活水平。我们青年团在工厂、矿山、交通运输和基本建设部门中的一切活动，都必须服从这个总方针。
    为了实现这个方针，厂矿企业和基本建设部门中团的组织要在党的领导下，和工会密切合作，发动团员团结全体青年工人积极地参加劳动竞赛。青年团员应该成为劳动竞赛中的积极分子。团的领导干部必须深入车间、小组和工地，和广大青年保持密切联系，经常了解他们的工作情况和思想、情绪，帮助他们解决疑难的问题，启发他们的自觉，订出先进而又切实可行的个人保证条件，把国家的计划变成他们自己的具体奋斗目标。在劳动竞赛中，过去已经出现今后还将继续出现许许多多的青年先进生产者。他们用英勇的精神去克服一切困难，以创造性的劳动去打破旧的技术定额，创造新的定额，并且提出各种合理化建议。我们的责任就在于及时地发现、支持和培养他们。我们应该在广大青年工人中培植一种尊重先进人物的风气，使大家学习他们的爱国主义劳动态度和先进的经验。只有这样，我们才能有力地去教育广大青年工人热爱劳动，并促使青年中的中间和落后的部分赶上先进者的水平。在劳动竞赛中，我们还必须注意发挥青年工程技术人员和青年职员的积极性，帮助他们与工人密切结合起来，共同搞好生产。
        青年团应该特别注意巩固厂矿企业和基本建设部门中的劳动纪律。任何劳动纪律的松弛和不爱护公共财产的行为，不仅影响着生产计划的完成，也妨碍着青年工人共产主义意识和道德的成长。青年团要在党的领导下，对团员和青年工人经常进行遵守劳动纪律和爱护国家财富的教育，对破坏劳动纪律的要展开适当的批评和斗争。这是发挥青年积极性和教育青年的一个重要的工作。
    组织青年工人掌握技术，学习文化，培养他们尽快地成为熟练工人，这是国家的迫切需要，也是青年工人的热烈要求。我们要组织他们在实际操作中学习技术；同时，还要根据生产发展的需要和青年工人的技术、文化程度，组织他们分别参加业余的技术和文化的学习组织。团的组织应该经常了解青年的技术和文化的学习情况，帮助他们解决学习上的困难，鼓舞他们为祖国的建设而努力学习；应教育青年工人虚心地向师傅、成年工人和技术人员学习，务必使每一个青年懂得，不尊重有知识有经验的人，就堵塞了自己上进的门路。
    我们还应做好国家商店和合作社的青年店员的工作，教育他们更好的为生产服务，为消费者和社员服务，不断地提高业务熟练程度，努力完成国家的收购与销售计划；各级团的组织还应注意加强私营企业中团的工作。
    关心青年工人的生活福利是我们经常的责任。团的组织必须教育青年工人严格地遵守生产中的安全制度，积极支持那些必要和可能的改善劳动条件及生活条件的建议和措施。团的组织还要教育青年以正确的态度对待自己的生活，要提倡体育运动，并要充分利用俱乐部与文化宫开展群众性的文化娱乐活动。
    第二，关于青年团在农业战线上的任务。
    我们的祖国，在发展工业生产的同时，要不断地更进一步地提高农业生产水平。党指示我们：“在工业建设的高潮之中，任何忽视农业生产的观点，都是片面的，错误的。”“必须认真做好农业生产。在农村中压倒一切的工作是农业生产工作，其他工作都是围绕农业生产工作而为它服务的。”“应引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利的原则，组织各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作。”根据党所提出的这些任务，我们应该进一步地动员农村中五百多万团员，团结广大农村青年为生产更多的粮食和工业原料，为进一步改善农民的生活而斗争。
    为了达到这个目的，一切农村团的组织要以做好农业生产作为自己全部工作的中心，动员青年农民积极参加爱国增产运动；要在党的领导下经常讨论青年在生产中的问题，凡是有利于生产的事情，例如：兴修水利，改良品种，改进耕作技术，防旱防涝，防治病虫害，都要发动青年积极参加；凡是妨碍生产的事情，都要及时阻止和坚决反对。要教育团员安心农业生产和热爱农业劳动，让大家懂得农业生产在国民经济中的重要性。每个农村团员都要做好农业生产，以自己的实际行动影响和推动其他青年。
    农村团的组织要教育团员懂得并正确地推行党的农业生产互助合作政策。我们一方面要向家庭和广大群众宣传互助合作是使农民生活丰裕共同上升的必经道路，而自愿地“组织起来”；另一方面我们又要时刻记住在推行农业生产互助合作时，要照顾小农经济的特点，要照顾单干农民，引导大家逐步前进，不要急躁冒进。对于已经参加互助合作组织的团员，要教育他们严格遵守党中央的指示：“共产党员和青年团员实行互助合作的原则、积极生产、遵守纪律等，应成为全体农民的模范，不能在互助组和合作社中贪占任何非分的便宜”。
    农村团的组织应组织团员和青年从当地实际情况与可能条件出发，努力学习农业技术，虚心地向当地有经验的农民和劳动模范学习增产经验和战胜自然灾害的经验。要根据自愿和不妨碍生产的原则，组织团员和青年参加民校、识字组，学习文化和科学常识，开展适合农村情况的文化娱乐活动。
    第三，关于青年团在学校中的任务。
    青年团在学校中已经有了一百三十多万团员，青年团已经成为党团结广大学生的核心。我们应该在党和政府对学校所采取的“整顿巩固，重点发展，提高质量，稳步前进”的方针下，协助党和人民政府做好学校工作，以培养广大同学成为德才兼备、体魄健全的建设人材。
        为了达到这个目的，学校团的组织首先要教育团员遵守学校的纪律，完成教学计划，努力学好功课，以实际行动影响和帮助同学学习。其次，在学习中要提倡发展同学们自由思考的能力和实事求是的风气，对于同学中各种不同的认识应经过充分的讨论，弄清道理，求得进步，以帮助他们真正牢固地掌握知识和养成追求真理的作风。再次，要在学校统一计划和不妨碍正常学习的条件下，团结同学自愿参加必要的社会活动和校内有关公共福利的工作，借以培养大家为公共事业劳动和联系群众的品质。学校中团的组织还要经常关心同学的身体健康，协助学校开展体育文娱活动，使每个同学都得到适当的休息和应有的体格锻炼。
    我们青年团应当尊敬、关心和帮助教师们的工作。目前在各级学校中青年教师占有相当的数量，他们是教育工作中的新生力量，教师中的青年团员，应当团结其他青年教师和广大的成年教师在教学工作中发挥积极作用。
    在我们伟大祖国的怀抱里，不断地成长着几千万的少年儿童。他们是我国人民的伟大革命和建设事业的继承人。党和人民政府是要把他们教养成为身体和精神都健康的新一代，成为未来新生活的建设者。我们青年团接受党的委托，建立了少年儿童队的组织，它的队员现在已有七百万。这个组织，在培养少年儿童的爱国思想，提高他们的学习兴趣，启发他们爱好劳动和培养他们的主动性与纪律性等方面，起着良好的作用。考虑到少年儿童队的性质和队员们的愿望，党已经决定把少年儿童队改名为少年先锋队，我们应该加强对少年先锋队的帮助和领导。我们要像亲兄弟、亲姊妹一样地关心少年儿童。现在有些少年儿童的活动还有一些不适合少年儿童特点的现象，使他们担负了过多的社会工作，应当加以纠正。对那些旧社会遗留下来残害儿童身心健康的严重的恶劣现象，应该采取有效的办法进行批评和斗争。在培养少年儿童的高尚事业中，教师和辅导员同志们担负着光荣的责任。他们应不断地改进自己的工作，根据少年儿童的生理和心理条件，耐心地丰富少年儿童的知识，并以自己的模范行为做他们的良好榜样，教养少年儿童成为具有高尚道德品质的新一代。团的组织应关心小学教师和辅导员的工作，支持和表扬他们的成绩，帮助满足他们合理的要求。
    第四，关于在国家机关和人民团体中青年团的任务。
    在国家机关和人民团体的工作人员中，有将近一半的青年和一百万青年团员，他们的工作岗位虽有不同，但他们的工作都是建设伟大祖国的光荣劳动的一部分。团的组织的责任是要教育团员团结所有的青年工作人员，热爱自己的工作，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，不断地提高理论、政策和业务水平，养成良好的组织性和纪律性，准确地完成工作任务，积极参加公共生活，发扬廉洁的、朴素的、联系群众的工作作风，全心全意地为人民群众的利益服务。
    我国先进的文学和艺术创作，是教育青年为建设祖国而斗争的有力武器。我国青年非常喜爱优秀的文艺创作，他们从这些创作中吸取了力量。我们热望文学和艺术工作者更多地反映我国伟大的现实生活，更生动地刻画出那些保卫祖国、建设祖国的英雄们的形象。更深刻地描写我们党的伟大。文学、艺术战线上的青年团员们，应当努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习马克思列宁主义关于文学艺术的理论，学习毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话这一杰出的著作，同时应该深入群众，使自己的创作具有更高的思想性和艺术性。
    体育运动是增进青年健康，培养青年一代成为强壮、勇敢、坚毅的祖国建设者和保卫者的积极手段。青年需要长知识，长身体，因此不仅要努力学习，还要努力锻炼身体。同时，体育运动也是青年最爱好的文化活动之一，它使青年的生活更加丰富和活跃。因此，青年团的组织必须发动和组织青年参加各种体育活动和运动竞赛，协助和支持体育组织开展群众性的体育活动。
    第五，关于青年团在加强青年统一战线上的任务。
    在伟大的，艰巨的祖国建设任务面前，我们必须更进一步地广泛团结全国青年，在祖国建设的各个岗位上充分发挥作用。中国青年广泛的爱国统一战线，是我国人民民主统一战线的一个组成部分，它是以工农劳动青年和革命知识青年为基础，团结着全国青年，在中国共产党领导下，和全国人民一起为逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义而奋斗。青年团必须更好地学习和贯彻党的统一战线政策，克服目前还存在着的对于各兄弟民族青年、工商界青年、宗教青年、青年科学技术工作者以及社会上其他许多无组织的青年联系不够的缺点。青年团应大力支持民主青年联合会的工作。
    我们伟大祖国，是一个多民族的国家，我们还必须更进一步的加强在各兄弟民族地区的青年工作。我们要十分重视培养各兄弟民族中的青年干部，要善于根据各兄弟民族的特点及青年所喜爱的形式，要善于结合党和政府在民族地区各项政策的认真实施，继续加深在各兄弟民族青年中的爱国主义教育，把各族青年更广泛的团结与组织起来，并在这
    一基础上慎重的建立和发展团的组织。
    现在，我国历史上空前未有的普选运动已经开始了。这将使我国人民民主统一战线获得进一步的巩固和发展。青年团的组织应团结全国各民族、各阶层、各党派及各种宗教信仰的青年积极参加全国的选举运动，支持忠诚为人民为祖国服务的、密切联系群众的和在各阶层人民中有威信的人作为人民的代表，同时要选出与青年群众有密切联系、关心人民利益和青年切身要求，并为青年所拥护的人作为代表去参加各级人民代表大会，以更好地发挥青年在国家政治建设中的作用。
    第六，关于青年团在国防建设上的任务。
    为了保证我们伟大祖国的安全和全世界的持久和平，我们的国家正继续加强国防建设。光荣的中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军，站在保卫祖国的最前列，是我们祖国得以顺利进行建设事业的保卫者；全国青年对他们怀着衷心的尊敬和热爱。我们要继续学习中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军，用他们的英雄业迹，不断地增强青年保卫祖国的坚强意志。我们要继续加强民兵中的工作。中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军的青年团在党的教养下，为祖国作了出色的贡献，他们堪称全国团组织的模范。中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军的青年战士和青年团员们必须继续努力，不断地提高自己的政治水平，模范地遵守纪律，努力学习军事技术，提高文化，加强体格锻炼，为建设现代化的国防军，为保卫伟大的祖国而奋斗。保卫我们伟大的祖国，就是保卫我们的幸福生活，就是保卫我们更美好的将来，我们中国青年，一定要把这个神圣的职责勇敢地担当起来。
    第七，关于中国青年在国际方面的任务。
    我们青年团继承着中国社会主义青年团成立以来的国际主义传统，坚决执行毛主席团结国际友人的指示，努力不懈地加强着与世界爱好和平青年的国际团结，巩固以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，保卫远东与世界和平。中国青年一直是世界民主青年联盟的忠实支持者，积极参加它所组织的各种活动。我们曾热烈欢迎世界民主青年联盟代表团访问中国。我们正积极准备参加即将召开的第三届世界青年代表大会与第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，并相信通过这些活动，对广泛团结世界青年保卫和平与争取美好将来的斗争，将作出重大的贡献。在过去四年中，中国青年日益加强着与各国青年的友谊。我们曾热烈地欢迎苏联青年代表团与苏联青年艺术家到中国访问和表演，并派遣过青年代表团、学生代表团等到苏联访问参观。我们的青年代表曾到过各人民民主国家，出席这些国家的青年代表大会或青年大会。我国青年深切关怀与同情资本主义国家及殖民地与附属国青年今天的处境，我们对他们所进行的艰苦斗争已经并将继续表示支持。现在我们已和六十个国家的一百多个青年组织建立了联系。我们的青年代表到过二十个国家进行访问或参加会议，我们先后邀请和招待了四十五个国家青年的代表到中国访问、参观。这一切活动大大地加强了中国青年和各国青年在保卫世界和平斗争中的友谊和团结。
    新中国的伟大成就是和国际援助分不开的。我们感谢伟大的盟邦——苏联对我们的慷慨无私的援助，感谢各人民民主国家对我们热忱的支援，感谢全世界爱好和平民主的人民支持我们。为了建设我们的国家，毛主席号召全国人民学习苏联，我们应该更好地在全体团员和全国青年中推行学习苏联的运动。光荣的苏联列宁共产主义青年团永远是我们的榜样，我们要努力向他们学习。我们要用一切办法巩固中苏两国人民和青年之间的最伟大的友谊。
    三
    同志们！我们已经说明了建设时期青年团的总任务和在各个战线上的具体任务。为了完成这些任务，还必须进一步解决所有战线上青年们的一个共同的问题——学习和工作相结合的问题。
    应该说，在党和毛主席领导下，中国青年是努力学习的，学习是有成绩的。在我们队伍中涌现出的千万个英雄模范，他们所以能够为人民贡献出更多的力量和智慧，就是因为他们善于学习，善于把学习和工作相结合。学习的敌人是自己的满足，特别是在新的建设时期，为了更好地工作，我们还要更加努力学习。正因为这样，我们就不难理解为什么团的一届三中全会关于学习问题的决定受到全国各地团的组织、全体团员和广大青年的热烈拥护。现在我们按照团的一届三中全会的决定，来进一步地讨论和解决关于怎样学习的问题，关于学习和工作怎样相结合的问题。
    需要学习，这是大家所同意的，因为实际的生活已经给了我们很好的教育，没有学习，我们就不能够在这个新的历史条件下，成为党的真正的助手，就不能够很好地为建设祖国服务，我们的工作就不能前进，我们就将成为时代落伍者。但是在学习什么和怎样学习的问题上，却发生了许多不同的疑问和不同的解释，而有许多的看法时常是孤立的和片面的，因此是错误的。
    说到学习的问题，任何团员都应该学习共产主义的人生观和共产主义的道德观。这种人生观和道德观就是为人民服务的人生观和道德观，就是马克思列宁主义。关于这个问题，我们伟大的导师列宁早于一九二○年在他的“青年团的任务”这个有名的演说中加以说明了。他说：“做一个青年团员，就是要把自己的工作和能力用去为公共事业服务。这就是共产主义教育的实质。只有在这样的工作过程中，青年男女才能培养成为真正的共产主义者。只有当他们能在这种工作中收到实际效果时，他们才会变成为共产主义者。”
    列宁在他这个演说中，说到关于在苏联全国实行电气化的问题时，又说道：“现在还是十四五岁，但经过一二十年就会在共产主义社会内生活的这一代人，应当这样定下自己学习的全部任务，使青年每天在任何乡村，任何城市里，都能实际解决公共劳动中的某种任务，那怕是最微小，最平常的任务。”
    我们必须领会列宁教诲的精神。任何青年团员是不能够限于以对共产主义知识的一知半解为满足的。而且我们还必须懂得，只知道一些共产主义的
    一般知识还是万万不够的。共产主义的大厦是要人们齐心协力经过各个方面的具体的工作和艰苦的精心的劳动才能建筑起来的。因此，参加建筑这个大厦的人们，就必须在自己的工作岗位上力求精通有关的各种专门知识，以便有可能在实际工作中贡献自己最大的能力，否则就有可能成为空口说白话的
    “共产主义者”，这种空口说白话的人，对人民的事业是没有用处的。
    锻炼自己真正具有共产主义的人生观和道德观，将能够促进专门知识和专门业务的学习的进步。而在专门知识和专门业务上成为内行，成为能手，也就能够在为实现共产主义事业的斗争中作出一定的、真正的贡献。既要有共产主义的人生观和道德观，又要有精通业务的知识，这就是我们对全体青年和青年团员关于学习问题的要求；而在日常生活中，在党的领导下，培养青年们和青年团员们的共产主义的人生观和道德观，这是具有重大意义的。
    我们还必须说服那些不安心于自己的工作岗位和学习岗位的青年团员和青年。有一些农村的青年和青年团员，不安于农业的生产，他们认为农业生产没有出息，他们就没有兴趣去学习有关农业生产的工作和技术。在工厂中也有一些青年工人和一些青年团员不安于自己的工作，例如一些轻工业中的青年愿意转到重工业，一些做翻砂工作的青年愿意作车工。因此阻碍了对于技术的学习。在学校中，也有许多青年和青年团员，认为要学习就必须学习重工业，对农业没有兴趣学习，对政治法律没有兴趣学习，对师范学校也没有兴趣进去，甚至觉得修下水道也还不算是建设的工作，学起来不够味道。显然，所有这一切的看法都是不对的。我们祖国的建设事业是需要多方面的工作和多方面的知识，所以各个部分的工作，都是我们整个事业所不可缺少的，都是互相依赖的。我们的社会不能够没有农业而只有工业，也不能够只有经济建设而没有政治工作和文化建设。凡是有益的劳动都是光荣的事业，我们应当热爱自己的岗位。只要对自己的工作专心致志，精益求精，那么，在任何岗位上都可以发挥自己的才能，都可以达到前人所没有达到过的成就，因而造福于社会。
    在学习问题上，还有下列的一些错误的看法。例如，有的仿佛认为要学习就只是学习文化；有的仿佛认为要学习就只是学习技术；有的认为只有进学校、训练班才算学习；有的认为在工作中学习很困难，甚至不能学习；有的在具体的工作岗位上放松了工作而去片面地强调学习；有的在学校中，过分地强调了社会的和课外的活动而放松了基本功课的学习；有的认为领导学习既然是团的中心任务，那么，团就没有旁的工作可做了。概括说来，这些看法的错误，就是把学习技术和学习文化割裂开来，把工作和学习对立起来。
    提高文化和提高技术是有连带关系的，学习文化是学习更高的技术的必要的工具，这些道理是不用多说的。应当说明一点：根据可能的条件，逐步地学习文化，在文化上得到更多的东西，这是每一个青年团员以及所有青年都应该努力的。至于说到技术，那么在工作中，一般说来，就应当是“做什么，学什么”，就应当根据各种不同企业的青年工人，青年农民和其他在各种不同工作岗位上的青年的具体的工作条件和具体的学习要求，从而决定他们的学习内容和学习步骤，以便不断地提高他们的技能以及搞好工作和生产。如果不分别各种青年的要求，而去笼统地和混乱地组织学习，就会“文不对题”，就不能够得到好的效果。
    随着我们祖国建设的发展，我们的各种学校和训练班还要日益发展，这是没有疑问的。但是，如果认为只有在学校和训练班中才能够学习，这种意见就是很错误的了。在实际上说来，我们为人民服务的工作是没有尽头的，我们的知识也是没有尽头的，因此，我们的学习也是没有尽头的。在学校和训练班中学习，对于我们学习的整个过程来说，这只是一种方式，一个方面，一个阶段，而某一种知识的成熟，是必须依靠于在长期的生产中、工作中和斗争中培养和积累起来的。我们在生产中、工作中、斗争中只要能够经常留神，便能够得到许多的学问。“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”这是毛主席告诉我们的话，事实正是这样的。
    我们在生产中、工作中和斗争中如何学习呢？这就是要经常注意研究马克思列宁主义，要善于向党学习，善于向有经验的人学习，善于向四周围的人学习。这就是要在生产中、工作中和斗争中善于接受和领会人类的先进经验和知识，并敢于根据前人、别人和自己的经验进行新的试验和新的创造。这就是“边做边学、逐步提高”的方法。采用这种方法，工作与学习也就统一起来了。这样，在工作中学习，不但不会妨碍工作，而且只能够推动工作的进步。采用这种方法，也就是说必须戒骄戒躁，不能够有一得就自己满足，而且在学习上要真正见效，就要准备长期地学，耐心地学。现在有些同志对于学习的规律和学习的困难认识不足，在学习上犯了急性病，想很快地一下子学会许多东西，好高骛远，急于求成，虽然这种积极的热情是很可宝贵的，但是不懂得循序而进，结果是“欲速则不达”，而当他们的企图不能实现的时候，却又灰心丧气起来。这种现象是需要避免的。
    应该说明，在各个工作岗位上的青年团员也必须认真贯彻党和团关于工作与学习相结合的这个方针，而在工作中努力学习。如果青年团员自己不首先苦学，却要指手划脚地号召别人，结果是“说到做不到，句句放空炮”，只能引起各方面的责备，这种情形是应该努力避免的。”
    四
    同志们！四年来，我们遵照着中国共产党中央的建团指示，密切结合党和国家在各个时期的中心任务，进行了建立团的组织和发展团员的工作。现在，团的组织有了很大的发展，团员已从第一次代表大会时的十九万人增加到九百万人，我们已经建成了一个全国性的有广大群众基础的青年团。青年团四年来受到了党的亲切的关怀和抚养而成长和壮大起来，我们的团员绝大部分是好的，他们在各种斗争中是勇敢的，在各种工作中是积极的。这是青年团组织情况的基本方面。但正由于在短时期内我们的组织发展的这样大，而在发展的过程中，我们的教育工作和组织工作又做得不够，因此团的组织中还存在着很多的缺点。这些缺点表现在：有的地方发展团员时追求数字，降低标准，以致有一部分团员并不具备团员条件，甚至还有个别的坏分子混入团内；有些团员入团后，没有及时编入支部参加团内生活受到教育；有些支部还处于涣散状态，不起作用；广大的团员和团的干部虽经过一定的工作锻炼，但一般的他们所受到的思想教育和组织训练不够，经验不足。在工作中不少干部还不善于领导团员正确地发挥作用，不善于按照青年的特点，采用青年所喜闻乐见的生动活泼的方法来进行工作，不懂得青年团的作风应当是既严肃而又活泼，既反对轻浮而又反对沉闷枯燥，如果我们要求青年和要求成年老年一样，就一定要脱离实际，脱离群众。
    为了适应变化了的形势和任务，为了解决团组织中所存在的上述问题，我们的组织工作，在今后一个时期内，必须采取巩固地向前发展的方针。如果在过去当着全国大部分地区尚没有团的组织，而广大先进青年又迫切要求入团的时候，我们遵照团章规定的入团条件，采取较快发展的方针是正确的必要的；那么，在现在各个方面都已建立了团的组织及部分团的组织亟待整理巩固的时候，就要求我们在组织工作方面采取巩固地向前发展的方针。巩固地发展并不是停止发展。因为在目前我们团的发展是不平衡的，有些地方根本还没有团的组织，有些单位团员数目仍然很少，如大部分基本建设部门、及个别工厂、矿山的主要车间和部分的国营农场等。在那些尚无团的组织或团的组织较小的地方必须继续发展团的组织。就是在那些团员数目已经占青年比例较大的地方，对那些符合入团条件而自动要求入团的先进青年，仍应吸收他们入团。
    如何巩固团的组织呢？必须从思想上、政治上和组织上来巩固，这就是说，要加强对团员的教育，大力培养干部，健全基层组织，增强团的组织性和纪律性，及对某些涣散的组织作必要的整理。
    我们应该很好地进行团的教育工作，不断地以共产主义的精神、党的政策、人民政府的法令和作一个青年团员的全部条件去教育广大团员，提高广大团员的觉悟水平，以增强青年团的战斗力，使团员不但具有专门的业务技能和科学知识，而且养成优良的道德品质，善于把自己的个人利益服从国家的整体利益，善于把他们在不同工作岗位上所从事的日常工作与完成国家建设的伟大任务联系起来，并善于经过自己的日常工作去实现国家建设的伟大任务。为了达到上述教育目的，我们对团员的教育，必须与每个时期国家和党的中心工作相结合，必须与不同岗位上的团员的具体任务相结合。我们必须不断地了解团员的思想情况和基层组织的实际问题，采取深入细致的方法，具体帮助他们解决。团的干部必须认真研究团员在生产、工作、学习过程中完成任务的经验，抓住团员中的好坏事例，在团员中展开讨论，用表扬和批评的方法，用团员群众创造的经验，来教育团员。同时，为了加强全团的教育工作，全团都要更加重视党报、团报、团刊和团内教材以及青年少年读物的编辑和出版工作。团课在很多地方行之有效，应总结其成功经验，根据可能条件，加以推广。
    我们应该健全团的基层组织和对某些基层组织作必要的整理。四年来我们已建立了三十八万个基层组织。在国家机关、国营厂矿企业、基本建设工地、较大的私营工厂商店、中等以上的学校以及全国百分之七十以上的乡村和很多街道都已有了团的组织。在中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军中，团的组织也有了很大发展。在一部分少数民族地区也建立了团的组织。遍布祖国各个地方和各个工作岗位上的绝大部分团的基层组织，在各种民主改革运动和日常的斗争和工作中都发挥了积极作用，它们已成为吸引和鼓舞不同职业不同民族的男女青年团结和进步的巨大力量。但是，很多工厂、农村的基层组织还习惯于民主改革运动中的一套作法，未能随着国家建设事业的开展，把自己的活动中心转到生产上面来，有些学校的基层组织也没有以学习为中心去进行自己的活动。经验证明：基层组织凡是正确掌握了并切实去实现了自己中心任务，又经常注意组织一些青年的文娱体育活动和关心青年的休息，它们的工作就有内容，就有生气，它们就能得到团员和群众的拥护，就能使自己的组织得到巩固和发展；反之，工作就缺乏内容，就得不到群众拥护，就不能使自己的组织得到巩固和发展。因此，巩固基层组织的首要办法，就是各级团委必须根据党的中心任务和团的各种基层组织的具体情况，运用工作好的基层组织的成功经验，建立自己经常的工作。对那些缺少经常组织生活以致处于松懈涣散的基层组织，则首先应当经过一定的教育，结合实际情况有领导有步骤地加以必要的整理。
    我们应该加强团的组织性和纪律性，并且自上而下地把团内民主生活健全起来。经验证明：只有有
    了健全的民主生活，才能够使广大干部和广大团员
    的积极性和创造性得到更充分的发挥；也只有有了健全的民主生活，才能在自觉的基础上加强团的组织性和纪律性。我们应当对团员加强组织性和纪律性的教育，以便经过他们去影响广大青年，执行党的政策和遵守国家的法令。为了保证团的组织有正常的民主生活，克服有些基层组织不在工作中发挥团员的积极性，和少数人包办一切的毛病，在所有的基层组织中，都要定期召开全体团员大会或团员代表大会，改选基层组织的领导，开展批评与自我批评。同时各级团委还要经常有准备地恰当地召开一些工作会议，和定期举行代表会议或代表大会，用这种依靠群众的方法来总结工作和改进工作。由于青年处在一个成长和学习的时期，对一般青年和团员都不能要求一种过于严格的纪律，不注意培养团员和一般青年的优良的个性，不懂得适应青年的生动活泼的作风，那种滥用“斗争”的方法来对待团员和一般青年的偏向，必须加以纠正。
    我们应该加强培养、训练干部的工作，特别是加强对基层干部的教育工作。几年来，我们在全国各地陆续开办了三十一个团校，训练了大批专职干部，到去年六月已轮训了五十五万名基层干部。正是由于全团在各级党委的亲切领导下，注意了这个问题，新的干部才不断地生长起来，才使我们能够胜利地适应工作局面的开展，并能够向党和政府部门输送近四万名区级以上干部和一百余万名基层干部。随着革命工作的发展和国家建设时期的来到，我们有责任培养出更多和更好的干部。这就是说，要在团的组织中培养大批新生长起来的忠实于党和人民事业的、朝气勃勃的优秀干部。由于我们的祖国已进入一个新的建设时期，而我们团的组织和广大团员分布在工厂、矿山、农村、学校、机关等不同的部门，从事不同方面的建设工作，这就要求我们必须注意培养适合于在各种不同部门中进行工作的干部。使我们的干部不仅忠实于党和人民的事业，而且通晓自己所在部门的业务，懂得根据自己所在部门的具体条件进行团的工作，这样，也就有可能为党和国家推荐更多的从事各方面建设工作的干部。为了达到这种要求，除应该把团校办得更好，使它更切合实际以外，主要是靠各级团的组织经常给干部以具体的指导和帮助，特别是指导他们认真地总结工作经验和切实地组织他们进行各方面的学习。目前许多基层组织干部，特别是新的基层组织干部，不会做工作，各地团委除有计划地对他们进行轮流训练外，要特别注意深入基层，从工作中耐心地去帮助和教育他们。为了大量地提拔干部，必须注意发现和培养新生长起来的优秀干部，并大胆而恰当地把他们提拔到团的领导岗位上来。根据目前团的干部情况，特别应该注意培养工农劳动青年中的优秀分子，以及培养青年妇女干部。在少数民族地区则应注意培养少数民族干部。为了正确地挑选和使用干部，必须克服只从表格、汇报、甚至凭个人印象了解干部的作法的偏向，而必须从检查工作中，从与工作人员亲自接触并实际考察其工作状况中，来了解、认识干部。不仅要从领导者方面，而且要从被领导者和群众方面，来了解、认识干部。在培养和挑选干部的工作中，对基层组织干部的培养和挑选，应该十分重视。青年团是党的后备军，应当根据党的需要有计划地向党推荐干部，同时要按照毛主席的指示，“保留必要骨干，以资熟手。”特别是一省一市要有二、三个重点县、区和厂矿的领导干部较长期地稳定下来，以利于积累经验，和培养新的干部。
    我们应该加强和改进各级团委的领导，这里最可靠的保证就是各级团委要十分尊重党中央和各级党委的领导。我们应当时刻记住斯大林同志的指示：
    “保证党的领导是共产主义青年团全部工作中最主要和最重大的事情。”因此，一方面青年团不要脱离各级党组织的中心任务，孤立地强调团组织的特殊任务，以及过分地强调团的垂直领导；另一方面，为了切实地完成党和同级党委交给团组织的任务，使团真正成为党团结教育青年的亲切助手，各级团委应当在党委的监督和指导下有系统地建立自己的经常的工作，而不要撇开团的组织，放弃团在广大青年群众中的活动。如果不是这样，都不能保证党在青年中的领导。为着加强和改进各级团委的领导，我们还必须联系实际，深入下层，特别应当学习生产知识，以便获得领导青年完成生产任务的本领，解决青年在生产中提出的问题，提高团的领导水平。
