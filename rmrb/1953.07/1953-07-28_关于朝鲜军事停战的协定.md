    ARTICLE I MILITARY DEMARCATION LINE AND DEMILITARIZED ZONE

    1.  A Military Demarcation Line is hereby established and both sides shall withdraw two (2) kilometers from this line so as to establish a Demilitarized Zone between the opposing forces. A Demilitarized Zone shall be established as a buffer zone to prevent the occurrence of incidents which might lead to a resumption of hostilities.

    2.  The Military Demarcation Line is located as indicated on the attached map (Attachment 1).

    3.  The Demilitarized Zone is defined by a northern and southern boundary as indicated on the attached map (Attachment 1).

    4.  The Military Demarcation Line shall be plainly marked as directed by the Military Armistice Commission hereinafter established. The Commanders of the opposing sides shall have suitable markers erected along the boundary between the Demilitarized Zone and their respective areas. The Military Armistice Commission shall supervise the erection of all markers placed along the Military Demarcation Line and along the boundaries of the Demilitarized Zone.

    5.  The waters of the Han River Estuary, where one bank is controlled by one side and the other bank is controlled by the other side, shall be open to civil shipping of both sides. The rules for such shipping shall be as prescribed by the Military Armistice Commission. Civil shipping of each side shall have unrestricted access to the land under the military control of that side.

    6.  Neither side shall conduct any hostile act within, from, or against the Demilitarized Zone.

The number of persons, military or civilian, authorized by either side to enter the Demilitarized Zone for the conduct of civil administration and relief shall be determined by the respective Commanders, but in no case shall the total number authorized by either side exceed one thousand (1,000) persons at any one time. The number of civil police and the arms to be carried by them shall be as prescribed by the Military Armistice Commission. Other personnel shall not carry arms unless specifically authorized to do so by the Military Armistice Commission.

    ARTICLE II SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENTS FOR CEASE-FIRE AND ARMISTICE

    A. GENERAL

    12. The Commanders of the opposing sides hereby order and insure that all elements of their armed forces, including all units and personnel thereof, will completely cease all hostilities in Korea, such a complete cessation of hostilities to be effective twelve (12) hours after this Armistice Agreement is signed. (See Paragraph 63 hereof for effective date and hour of the remaining provisions of this Armistice Agreement.)

    13. In order to insure the stability of the Military Armistice so as to facilitate the attainment of a peaceful settlement through the holding by both sides of a political conference of a higher level, the Commanders of the opposing sides:

    (a) Shall withdraw all of their military forces, supplies, and equipment from the Demilitarized Zone except as otherwise provided herein, and within seventy-two (72) hours after this Armistice Agreement becomes effective. All military forces, supplies, and equipment shall be withdrawn from the Demilitarized Zone. If such military forces are not withdrawn within the time limit specified above, and there is no mutually agreed and valid reason for the delay in withdrawal, the other side shall have the right to take any action necessary to maintain security and order. The term "coastal islands" above refers to those islands which, though occupied by one side when this Armistice Agreement becomes effective, were controlled by the other side on June 24, 1950; provided that all the islands north and west of the boundary between Hwanghae-do and Kyonggi-do provinces shall be under the military control of the Commander-in-Chief, Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, except the island groups of Paengyong-do (37°58'N, 124°40'E), Taechong-do (37°50'N, 124°42'E), Sochong-do (37°46'N, 124°46'E), Yonpyong-do (37°38'N, 125°40'E), and U-do (37°36'N, 125°58'E), which shall remain under the military control of the Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command. All the islands on the west coast of Korea lying south of the above-mentioned line shall remain under the military control of the Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command (See Attachment 3).

    (b) Shall cease the introduction into Korea of reinforcing military personnel; provided, however, that the rotation of units and personnel, the arrival in Korea of personnel on a temporary duty basis, and the return to Korea of personnel after short periods of leave or temporary duty outside of Korea shall be permitted within the limitations hereinafter provided.

        "Rotation" is defined as the replacement of units or personnel by other units or personnel who are commencing a tour of duty in Korea. Rotation personnel shall be permitted to enter and depart Korea only through the ports of entry enumerated in Paragraph 43 hereof. Rotation shall be conducted on a man-for-man basis; provided, however, that no more than thirty-five thousand (35,000) military personnel in total shall be introduced into Korea each month under the rotation policy. No military personnel of either side shall be introduced into Korea if the introduction of such personnel will cause the aggregate number of military personnel of that side introduced into Korea since the effective date of this Armistice Agreement to exceed the cumulative total number of military personnel of that side who have departed from Korea since that date. Reports concerning arrivals and departures of military personnel shall be made daily to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; such reports shall include the places of arrival and departure and the number of persons arriving at and departing from each such place. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, through its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, shall conduct supervision and inspection of the rotation of units and personnel authorized above, at the ports of entry enumerated in Paragraph 43 hereof.

    (c) Shall cease the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition; provided, however, that combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition which are destroyed, damaged, worn out, or used up during the period of the armistice may be replaced on a piece-for-piece basis of the same effectiveness and the same type. Such combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition shall be introduced into Korea only through the ports of entry enumerated in Paragraph 43 hereof. In order to justify the need for the replacement of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition to be introduced into Korea for replacement purposes, reports concerning the introduction of such items shall be made to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; such reports shall include statements as to the disposition of the items being replaced. Items to be replaced which are removed from Korea shall be removed only through the ports of entry enumerated in Paragraph 43 hereof. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, through its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, shall conduct supervision and inspection of the replacement of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition authorized above, at the ports of entry enumerated in Paragraph 43 hereof.

    (d) Shall insure that personnel of their respective commands who violate any of the provisions of this Armistice Agreement are adequately punished.

    (e) Shall afford burial parties of the opposing side full opportunity to enter, within a definite time after this Armistice Agreement becomes effective, the area of Korea under their military control for the purpose of proceeding to graves of deceased military personnel of that side, including deceased prisoners of war, so as to recover and evacuate the bodies of such personnel. The specific procedures and the time limit for carrying out the above provisions shall be determined by the Military Armistice Commission. The Commanders of the opposing sides shall furnish to each other all available information pertaining to the places where the graves of the deceased military personnel of the other side are located.

    (f) Shall provide full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation to the Military Armistice Commission, its Joint Observer Teams, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, in the carrying out of their functions and responsibilities hereinafter assigned; and shall provide safe conduct to personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and of its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams between the headquarters of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and those ports of entry enumerated in Paragraph 43 hereof over routes designated by mutual agreement (See Attachment 4). In order to avoid unnecessary delays, the use of alternate routes and means of transportation will be permitted as necessary where the designated routes are closed or impassable.

    (g) Shall provide logistic support, including communications and transportation facilities, as required by the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and their Teams.

    (h) Shall each construct, operate, and maintain a suitable airfield in their respective areas in the vicinity of the headquarters of the Military Armistice Commission, for such uses as the Military Armistice Commission may determine.

    (i) Shall insure that all members and other personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission hereinafter established shall enjoy the freedom and facilities necessary for the proper exercise of their functions, including privileges, treatment, and immunities equivalent to those ordinarily enjoyed by accredited diplomatic personnel under international usage.

    14. This Armistice Agreement shall apply to all opposing ground forces under the military control of either side, which ground forces shall respect the Demilitarized Zone and the area of Korea under the military control of the opposing side.

    15. This Armistice Agreement shall apply to all opposing naval forces, which naval forces shall respect the waters contiguous to the Demilitarized Zone and to the land area of Korea under the military control of the opposing side, and shall not engage in any blockade of any kind of Korea.

    第一条军事分界线与非军事区
    一、确定一军事分界线，双方各由此线后退二公里，以便在敌对军队之间建立一非军事区。建立一非军事区作为缓冲区，以防止发生可能导致敌对行为复发的事件。
