Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd. TASS, Berlin, 1st—On June 23rd, the three Western commanders of West Berlin sent a letter to Major General Gibrilov, Military Commander of the Soviet Zone of Berlin, regarding the riots that occurred in the eastern district of Berlin.

Major General Gibrilov replied on June 30th, citing many facts to prove that the disturbances in the Soviet Zone of Berlin on June 17th were instigated by provocateurs and fascist agents who infiltrated from West Berlin, and that American officers participated in creating this incident.

In his letter, Major General Gibrilov reminded the three Western commanders that General Chuikov had listed many facts in his letters to the US, British, and French High Commissioners on October 1st and December 30th, 1952, respectively, illustrating the acts of terror, sabotage, and espionage carried out by West Berlin's criminal organizations, such as the German Youth League, the so-called Campaign Group Against Inhumanity, and the Eastern Bureau of the Social Democratic Party, against the people of the German Democratic Republic. He resolutely demanded the immediate dissolution of these organizations, rightly considering that the American, British, and French occupying authorities should bear full responsibility for the consequences of the criminal activities of the aforementioned terrorist organizations.

Major General Gibrilov emphasized that the American, British, and French occupying authorities have not taken the necessary measures to this day to dissolve the aforementioned criminal organizations hiding in West Berlin. Even after the riots in East Berlin were suppressed, fascists were still holding large and small gatherings in West Berlin in the presence of representatives of the three Western occupying countries; at these gatherings, Adenauer, Kaiser, Reuter, and other organizers of the June 17th riots called for new adventures and provocations against East Berlin and the German Democratic Republic.

Gibrilov said that this situation in West Berlin endangers the social order and security of the people of the German Democratic Republic. However, in their letter of June 23rd, the three Western commanders evaded taking the necessary measures to guarantee that criminal elements would not be sent into East Berlin. Major General Gibrilov reiterated the views expressed in his previous letter to the three Western commanders on June 20th, emphasizing that such a guarantee is an indispensable condition for restoring traffic between East and West Berlin.

    柏林苏占区军事司令致函西柏林三国司令
    要求保证不派罪恶分子到东柏林
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社柏林一日讯：六月二十三日，西柏林三国司令曾就柏林东区发生的骚乱事件致函柏林苏占区军事司令吉布罗瓦少将。
    吉布罗瓦少将在六月三十日回信，援引许多事实证明，六月十七日柏林苏占区发生的骚动是由柏林西区潜入的挑拨者和法西斯特务所策动的，而且美国军官参加了制造这次事件。
    吉布罗瓦少将在信中提醒西方三国司令：崔可夫大将曾在一九五二年十月一日和十二月三十日分别致美、英、法三国高级专员的信中列举了许多事实，说明像德国青年联盟、所谓反对非人道主义斗争团和社会民主党东方局之类的西柏林罪恶组织对德意志民主共和国人民进行的恐怖、破坏和间谍活动，并坚决要求立即解散这些组织，正确地认为，美、英、法占领当局对上述恐怖组织的罪恶活动的后果应负全部责任。
    吉布罗瓦少将着重指出：美、英、法三国占领当局直到今天还没有采取必要的措施，解散藏身在西柏林的上述罪恶组织。甚至在东柏林的骚乱被制止后，法西斯分子还在西柏林当着三个西方占领国家代表的面举行大大小小的集会；在这些集会上，阿登纳、凯撒、鲁特和六月十七日的骚乱事件的其他组织者号召对东柏林和德意志民主共和国进行新的冒险和挑衅。
    吉布罗瓦说：西柏林的这种情况危及德意志民主共和国人民的社会秩序和安全。然而在六月二十三日的信中，西方三国司令却规避采取必要的措施保证不把罪恶分子派到东柏林境内。吉布罗瓦少将重申他六月二十日写给西方三国司令的上次信中所说的意见，强调这种保证是恢复东柏林和西柏林之间的交通的必不可少的条件。
