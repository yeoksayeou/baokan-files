Xinhua News Agency, July 8th: British parliamentarians and newspapers continue to denounce Syngman Rhee's increasingly blatant behavior of sabotaging the armistice.

    British Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) Harold Wilson said on the 3rd that if South Korea refuses to accept the armistice of the United Nations forces, it would be tantamount to committing a crime of aggression. He said that from the perspective of world peace, the United Nations should take strong measures to deal with Syngman Rhee's aggression. Labour MP Emrys Hughes questioned in the House of Commons on the 6th: "How long do we have to wait before we can go to the United Nations to ask them to condemn Syngman Rhee as an aggressor and invite the Chinese to restrain him?" Former Labour Secretary of State for War John Strachey said in the House of Commons on the 6th: Unless effective steps are taken to make Syngman Rhee see reason, British troops will find themselves in a difficult position politically, and possibly militarily.

    The "Daily Herald" published a commentary by Yule on the 1st titled "Rhee Doesn't Want Peace," saying: Syngman Rhee's attitude "is disturbing." "What Rhee is opposed to is not this or that point in the armistice agreement. He simply does not want an armistice."

    英国议员和报纸继续斥责李承晚破坏停战
    【新华社八日讯】英国议员和报纸继续斥责李承晚愈益嚣张的破坏停战的行为。
    英国工党议员威尔逊在三日说，如果南朝鲜拒绝接受联合国军的停战，就等于犯了侵略罪。他说，从世界和平的前途来说，联合国应该采取有力的措施来对付李承晚的侵略。工党议员埃姆里斯·休斯六日在下议院中质问道：“要等多久我们才能够到联合国去要求他们谴责李承晚为侵略者，并邀请中国人来约束他？”前工党陆军大臣约翰·斯特拉彻六日在下议院中说：除非采取有效的步骤使李承晚明白道理，否则英国军队将会发现他们在政治上，并可能在军事上，均将处于为难地位。
    “每日先驱报”一日发表伊威尔写的以“李承晚不愿停战”为题的评论说：李承晚的态度“是令人不安的”。“李承晚所反对的不是停战协定中的这一点或那一点。他根本就不愿意停战”。
