Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Paris "L'Humanité" reporter Béquet reported: I have just traveled on the road from Kaesong to Andong. Every meter of this road is a sign of the major military failures suffered by the United States in Korea. Every meter is a sign of the savage bombing carried out by the U.S. military due to the frustration of suffering defeat. There is countless evidence of the material destruction suffered in Korea. Between Kaesong and Pyongyang, even the smallest villages have been razed to the ground. Places like Sariwon, Namcheon, and other large towns with populations of fifty to one hundred thousand now have only some broken walls and rubble, sticking out isolatedly in the fields of ripe wheat or lush green rice paddies. However, the people are still there. The abundant grain is still there. Last year's harvest in Korea was 13 percent higher than in 1951, and despite the constant American bombing of the sluice gates, this year's harvest looks like it will be even better.

　　I happened to have traveled this road for the first time two years ago to participate in the armistice talks that had just begun. Now this road is very different compared to before. The road surface has been widened by a factor of two, and so have the bridges. The road surface is so smooth that I sped along this 500-kilometer stretch of road as if traveling on any road in Europe. The section from Kaesong to Pyongyang was traveled under bright moonlight. Enemy planes came. Flares and bombs were dropped. Machine guns strafed. A plane above our car was immediately subjected to intense fire from anti-aircraft guns, and the plane dared not attack and turned away. At the same time, twenty kilometers to the south, a red flame suddenly appeared, with a large luminous body in it, watching it slowly slide to the ground, like the setting moon, and then suddenly a burst of fire lit up the sky, and the American night bomber shattered into a ball of flame. The trip from Pyongyang to Andong was during the day, and there was no need to constantly pay attention to the sky.

　　On this trip, as on dozens of previous trips, the only dilapidated things that could be seen on the side of the road were some trucks painted with the American white star, which were left behind by the U.S. military during their hasty retreat in December 1950, and now these trucks have been covered with weeds and grain. In the past two years, the total number of trucks I have seen destroyed by American planes here probably does not exceed half a dozen. The road itself is a sign that the efficiency of the U.S. Air Force in Korea is very low. For more than a year, they have not dared to send out bombers during the day. In order to deceive public opinion and prevent people from knowing the huge blow suffered by American military prestige, the American military authorities hung bombs under the wings of Sabre jets, pretending to be bombers. They fabricate monstrous figures of daily losses of MiG aircraft - thus it seems as if the role of fighter planes is only to shoot down other fighter planes, rather than protecting attacking bombers or attacking incoming bombers. The truth is: from Pyongyang all the way to the Yalu River, MiG aircraft controlled the entire sky during the day, and they were able to ensure that road and rail transportation lines were 100% unimpeded, and defended Chinese territory. The U.S. Air Force can still carry out indiscriminate bombing at night. But, in fact, they have been defeated in the air just as they have been on the ground.

　　The best sign of American failure is the faces of the people seen on the sides of the road. Farmers are working hard in the fields, and groups of men, women, and children are repairing roads and widening bridges. Two years ago, this work had to be done at night. When the car stopped, people could only hear the sound of farmers driving oxen and using plows in the fields. Now, under the protection of MiG aircraft, they can come out to work during the day. There is no need to tell the world about how these people are suffering. There is already statistical proof of this, and everyone can provide concrete proof.

　　If you talk to any family in Korea, you will hear stories of unprecedented heroic suffering and sacrifice. But there is no sign of frustration on the faces of the old and young farmers. They show a serious expression, an expression of pride and self-respect, and an expression of joy and encouragement. Their faces are the faces of this heroic nation, who have fought on the front lines and in the rear, fought guerrillas in the mountains, and fought barehanded in the death camps on Geoje Island. Their faces show the determination to fight to the last person, and the sense of pride in resisting the most powerful imperialist country in the world on the 38th parallel.

　　I stopped by the road and talked to a group of teenagers, all of whom were holding baskets filled with dirt and stones. They were there to fill in the potholes on the road. The night before, a 500-pound bomb had fallen near this road, blowing dirt and rocks from the mountain to the side of the road. One of them, a fifteen-year-old girl with square-cut hair and the typical black eyes of a Korean, had a mischievous look on her face. She said: "These American devils are really nice, aren't they? If we had to dig up all this dirt and carry it here, it would take a week! But the American devils did this work for us in a second last night."

　　The large mountains along the road are covered with caves and bunkers, all connected by communication trenches. Work is still continuing. Preparations are being made to make every cave and every meter of trench a tomb for American aggressors or the Syngman Rhee "go-it-alone" army. This is a precautionary measure. But, if the imperialists carry out any further military adventures in Korea, whether it be an amphibious attack, a paratrooper attack, or a frontal attack, whether it be going it alone or doing it together, this military adventure will certainly suffer the same defeat that the American army has already suffered in the area of the 38th parallel and in the air.

    巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌报道
    美国和李承晚的任何军事冒险都将失败
    【新华社六日讯】巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌报道：我刚在开城到安东的公路上旅过行。在这条公路上，每一公尺都是美国在朝鲜受到重大军事失败的标志。每一公尺都是美国军方由于遭受失败的挫折而进行野蛮轰炸的标志。在朝鲜遭受的物质摧毁方面，有着无数的证据。在开城和平壤之间，即使最小的村庄也都被夷为平地了。像沙里院、南川和人口在五万到十万之间的其他大城镇，现在只有一些断墙残垣，突出地孤立在成熟的麦浪或一片葱绿色的稻田里。然而人们仍旧在那里。丰饶的谷物仍旧在那里。去年朝鲜的收成，比一九五一年要多出百分之十三，而尽管美国人不断的轰炸水闸，今年的收成看起来似乎还要好。
    我正好在两年以前第一次走过这条路，是去参加刚刚开始的停战谈判的。现在这条公路与以前相比，有了很大的不同。公路路面已加宽了一倍，桥梁也是一样。公路路面修得十分光滑，我在这五百多公里的公路上疾驰时，就好像在欧洲的任何公路上旅行一样。从开城到平壤这一段，是在明朗的月光下旅行的。敌机飞来了。照明弹和炸弹投下了。机枪在扫射了。在我们的车子近处上空的一架飞机，立即就受到高射炮的猛烈射击，于是这架飞机就不敢袭击而掉头逃走了。同时，在南面二十公里突然看到一团红色的火焰，在这团红色的火焰中有一大块发光体，看它很慢地滑到地面上，好像月亮西沉一样，于是突然一阵火光照亮了天空，美国夜航轰炸机变成一团火焰而粉碎了。由平壤到安东，是在大白天旅行的，根本无需时时注意天空。
    在这次旅行中，正像在以往的几十次旅行中一样，在路旁可以看到的破烂东西只有一些上面漆着美国白星的卡车，这些卡车是美军在一九五○年十二月狼狈撤退时丢下的，现在这些卡车已被杂草与谷物盖住了。两年来，我在此地看到的可能是被美国飞机击毁的卡车总数不会超过半打。公路本身就是标志，它说明美国的空军在朝鲜的效率很低。一年多来，他们在白天不敢出动轰炸机。为了蒙蔽舆论，使人们不知道美国军事威信所遭受的巨大打击，美国军事当局把炸弹挂在佩刀式喷气机的翼下，冒充是轰炸机。他们捏造每天米格飞机损失的神怪数字——从而看来好像战斗机的作用只是击落其他战斗机，而不是保护进攻的轰炸机或攻击来袭的轰炸机。事实真相是：从平壤直到鸭绿江边，米格飞机在白天控制了整个天空，它们能够百分之百地使公路与铁路交通线畅通无阻，并且捍卫着中国的领土。美国空军在晚上还可以盲目地进行轰炸。但是，事实上，他们在空中正像在陆地上一样地被打败了。
    美国失败的最好的标志是在公路两旁看到的人们的面孔。农民在田里努力地耕作，男女老幼成群结队地在修补马路与加宽桥梁。两年前，这种工作必须在夜间做。当车子停下来时，人们只能听到农民赶着耕牛用犁耙在田里工作的声音。现在，在米格飞机的保护下，他们已可以在白天出来工作。现在用不着把这些人民如何受苦的情况告诉世界。对于这一点，已经有统计的证明，每个人可以提供具体证明。
    如果你和朝鲜的任何一个家庭的人谈话的话，你便会听到史无前例的英勇地忍痛牺牲的事迹。但是从年老与年青的农民的面孔上看不出有什么沮丧的样子。他们所表现的是严肃的神情，是自豪与自尊的神情，他们所表现的是欢欣鼓舞的神情。他们的面孔就是这个英勇的民族的面孔，他们在前线，在后方都进行了战斗，在山上打游击，在巨济岛死亡营里赤手空拳地进行了斗争。他们的面孔表现了战斗到最后一个人的决心，表现了由于在三八线上抵抗住世界上最强大的帝国主义国家而感到自豪的神情。
    我在路旁停下来和一群十多岁的小孩子谈话，他们都拿着篮子，里面装的是泥土和石子。他们是来填补公路面上的坑洼的。头一天晚上，有一颗五百磅重的炸弹落在这条路的附近，把山上的泥土石头炸飞到公路旁边。其中有一个十五岁的女孩子，她的头发剪成方形，她有着典型朝鲜人的漆黑的眼珠，她脸上有着爱淘气的表情。她说：“这些美国鬼子可不真好吗？如果我们要把所有这些泥土挖起来搬运到这里，那总需要一星期的时间吧！可是，美国鬼子昨晚在一秒钟内便替我们做完了这个工作。”
    路旁一带的大山上布满了洞穴和地堡，全都由交通沟连接起来。工作仍然在继续进行。准备使每一个洞穴、每一公尺壕沟都成为美国侵略者或李承晚
    “单独干”的军队的坟墓。这是在进行预防万一的准备。但是，如果帝国主义者在朝鲜进行任何进一步的军事冒险，不管是两栖进攻、伞兵进攻或者是正面进攻，不管是单独干或者是一齐干，这种军事冒险将一定遭受到美国军队已经在三十八度线一带和空中遭受到的同样的失败。
