    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 13th: A Korean Central News Agency reporter reported from Panmunjom on the 12th: The meeting of the delegations of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations has been going on for three days since it resumed on July 10th. Although the meetings are held in secret, judging from the fact that there are no signs of preparing to reconvene staff officer meetings and liaison officer meetings for the signing of the armistice agreement, it can be inferred that the U.S. side has not yet given any satisfactory and definite answer to the important questions raised by our side regarding the implementation of the armistice agreement in these three days of meetings. This can also be seen in the joint statement issued by the American Robertson and Syngman Rhee on the 12th, because this statement does not mention any specific measures on how to abide by the various clauses of the armistice agreement and guarantee its implementation.
    It should be pointed out that in order to realize the Korean armistice as soon as possible, the U.S. side should quickly and clearly answer the following questions, namely: Does the signing of the armistice agreement include the Syngman Rhee group? If it is included, then the U.S. side must first guarantee that the Syngman Rhee group abides by the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, which is one of the clauses of the armistice agreement, and take measures to hand over those captured personnel of our side detained by Syngman Rhee to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. When the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is still clamoring for "northward unification," refusing to cease fire, and refusing to withdraw from the military demarcation line, how will the U.S. side, in its position as the "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces," guarantee the implementation of Articles 12 and 17 of the armistice agreement? When the representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, our Red Cross personnel, and explanation personnel arrive in South Korea, how does the U.S. side intend to protect their safety from the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's mad provocations?
    The above are all questions of greatest concern to the people of the world who wish for the early arrival of peace in Korea, and are also questions that the U.S. side must quickly answer. If the U.S. side has sincerity in ensuring the effective implementation of the armistice agreement, then the armistice agreement can be signed quickly.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: According to the Romanian News Agency, Bucharest, July 12th: The international news column of the Romanian "Spark" newspaper published a commentary saying: The action of the Korean-Chinese side in agreeing to resume the Korean armistice negotiations has aroused a strong response from the broad masses of the world and has also been welcomed by the ruling groups of many capitalist countries. However, the U.S. military headquarters still only takes a superficial attitude of protest towards Syngman Rhee's provocative actions, but in reality, it is indulging and encouraging them. They are unwilling to offer satisfactory guarantees, nor are they willing to take various steps to prevent such actions that undermine the armistice from happening again. The commentary said that the warmongers in the United States are using all their strength to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and other international disputes. Only they are alarmed and confused by the resumption of the Korean armistice negotiations. The commentary said that the people of the world must heighten their vigilance, strengthen their determination to strive for peace, and demand the rapid realization of the Korean armistice and the peaceful settlement of all international disputes.

    美方必须明确答复保障停战协定实施问题
    罗马尼亚“火花报”斥责美方继续纵容李承晚破坏停战
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜中央通讯社记者十二日自板门店报道：朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团会议自七月十日复会以来，已经进行了三天。虽然开的是秘密会议，但是从现在还没有为停战协定签字而准备再开参谋人员会议和联络官会议的迹象看来，可以推测到美方对我方所提的保障停战协定实施的重要质问，在这三天的会议上还没有作出任何令人满意的确切答复。这一点，在美国罗伯逊和李承晚于十二日发表的联合声明中，也可以看出来。因为这个声明中根本没有谈到怎样遵守停战协定各项条款和保障其实施的具体办法。
    应该指出：为了使朝鲜停战得以早日实现，美方应当迅速而明确地答复以下的几个问题，即：停战协定签订是否包括李承晚集团在内？如包括在内，那么美方首先必须保证李承晚集团遵守作为停战协定条款之一的遣返战俘的协议，采取措施来把那些被李承晚扣留的我方被俘人员交给中立国遣返委员会。当李承晚匪帮仍旧叫嚣“北进统一”、拒绝停火、拒绝从军事分界线撤退的时候，美方以“联合国军总司令”的立场将如何保障停战协定第十二款和第十七款的执行？当中立国遣返委员会的代表、我方红十字会人员和解释人员到达南朝鲜时，美方又打算如何从李承晚匪帮疯狂的挑衅行动中保障他们的安全？
    以上这些都是愿望朝鲜和平早日到来的全世界人民最关心的问题，也是美方必须迅速加以答复的问题。如果美方对于保证停战协定的确实执行有诚意，那么，停战协定便可以迅速地签字。
    【新华社十三日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特十二日讯：罗马尼亚“火花报”的国际新闻栏发表评论说：朝中方面同意恢复朝鲜停战谈判的行动，引起了全世界广大群众的有力响应，也受到许多资本主义国家的统治集团的欢迎。但是美军司令部对于李承晚的挑衅行动，仍然只是在表面上采取抗议的态度，而实际上却是纵容和鼓励。他们不愿提出令人满意的保证，也不愿采取各种步骤，使这种破坏停战的行动不再发生。评论说，美国的好战分子用尽一切力量阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题以及其他国际上的争端。只有他们才因朝鲜停战谈判的恢复而感到惊慌和混乱。评论说，全世界人民必须提高警惕，加强争取和平的决心，要求迅速实现朝鲜停战，要求和平解决一切国际争端。
