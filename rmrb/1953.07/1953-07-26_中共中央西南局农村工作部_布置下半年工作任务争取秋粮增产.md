The Rural Work Department of the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting in early July to review and summarize the work of the first half of the year and to deploy tasks for the second half of the year.

In the first half of the year, the Southwest Region, based on the spirit of the CPC Central Committee's instructions to Party committees at all levels on spring plowing production and other documents, carried out a series of work. As a result, agricultural production has basically become the overriding central task in rural areas. The chaotic phenomena and certain turbulent phenomena in rural areas have greatly changed, and the production enthusiasm of all classes has been generally stabilized and improved. Many leading cadres have changed their work style, gone deep into the fields, and specifically led production. Through loans, disaster relief, and improvement of rural supply and marketing work, they have solved the main difficulties of the masses in production, successfully survived the spring famine, and overcome the natural disasters that have already occurred. Therefore, this year's spring plowing production is better than in previous years, and small spring crops have generally achieved a bumper harvest except in a few disaster areas, creating conditions for striving for increased production of large autumn grains.

The meeting pointed out that the main shortcomings in the current rural work in the Southwest Region are: some areas have not correctly grasped and implemented the spirit of the three documents including the CPC Central Committee's instructions on spring plowing production, the production enthusiasm of the masses in some areas has not been completely stabilized, and the phenomenon of violating the three major principles in mutual aid groups has not been completely corrected. After criticizing the impetuous and rash advances in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in some areas, a laissez-faire phenomenon has emerged again, and the leadership of mutual aid and cooperative organizations has been relaxed. When promoting agricultural science and technology, some cadres did not proceed from local characteristics and mass experience, but mechanically transplanted experience from other places, resulting in new coercion and commandism. Although the leadership ability of cadres at the county, district, and township levels has improved, it is still far from meeting the needs of the current development of rural work. Most cadres are not good at grasping the work in an all-round way, are not good at closely combining the completion of tasks and the implementation of policies with meeting the requirements of the masses, and are not good at leading the masses by consulting with them. Therefore, continuing to implement the central task of production overriding everything, effectively overcoming the phenomenon of "five excesses," further strengthening the Party's political and economic work in rural areas, and improving the leadership level of cadres are the keys to doing rural work well at present.

The meeting determined that the main tasks for the second half of the year are: to continue to implement the spirit of the three documents including the CPC Central Committee's instructions on spring plowing production, and strive to complete the task of increasing autumn grain production in 1953; to further consolidate mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and in conjunction with the general election, steadily carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines; to conduct winter production, train cadres, and hold materials exchange meetings in a planned way to prepare for leading production next year. To this end, all localities must continue to publicize and implement policies, stabilize the production enthusiasm of all classes in rural areas, effectively solve the difficulties of farmers in production and life, prevent and overcome various natural disasters in a timely manner, and seize the opportunity to carry out mid-tillage, topdressing, autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing. In terms of mutual aid and cooperation, we must continue to overcome impetuous and rash advances, and prevent and correct the tendency of laissez-faire. At the same time, we must strengthen investigation and research work, strengthen the unified leadership of the Party Committee, improve the ideological and policy level of cadres, and effectively improve working methods. In addition, we should actively help farmers sell local and special products, improve the supply and marketing work of cooperatives, and invigorate the rural economy.

    中共中央西南局农村工作部
    布置下半年工作任务争取秋粮增产
    中共中央西南局农村工作部于七月上旬召开会议，检查总结了上半年的工作，并布置安排了下半年的任务。
    西南区上半年根据中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示等文件的精神，进行了一系列的工作，因此，农业生产基本上已成为农村压倒一切的中心工作，农村中的混乱现象及某些动荡现象有了很大的改变，各阶层的生产情绪普遍得到稳定和提高。许多领导干部转变了作风，深入田间，具体领导生产，通过贷款、救灾和改进农村供销工作，为群众解决了生产中的主要困难，顺利度过了春荒，并战胜了已经发生的自然灾害，所以今年的春耕生产，比已往那年都好，小春作物除少数灾区外普遍获得丰收，为争取大秋粮食的增产创造了条件。
    这次会议指出，当前西南区农村工作中存在的主要缺点是：部分地区还未正确掌握和贯彻中共中央关于春耕生产指示等三个文件的精神，部分地区群众的生产情绪还未完全稳定，互助组中违反三大原则的现象还未彻底纠正。有些地区在批判了互助合作运动中的急躁冒进情绪后，又产生了放任自流现象，放松了对互助合作组织的领导。部分干部在推广农业科学技术时，不从当地特点和群众经验出发，机械搬用外地经验，以致产生了新的强迫命令。各地县、区、乡干部的领导能力虽有提高，但还远赶不上目前农村工作发展的需要。多数干部还不善于全面地掌握工作，不善于把完成任务和执行政策与满足群众的要求紧密结合起来，不善于用和群众商量的办法去领导群众。因此，继续贯彻以生产为压倒一切的中心任务，切实有效地克服“五多”现象，进一步加强党在农村的政治工作与经济工作，提高干部的领导水平是当前作好农村工作的关键。
    会议确定下半年的主要任务是：继续贯彻中共中央关于春耕生产指示等三个文件的精神，争取完成一九五三年秋粮增产任务；进一步巩固互助合作组织，并结合普选，稳健地进行反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争；有计划地进行冬季生产、训练干部、召开物资交流会，为明年领导生产作好准备。为此，各地必须继续宣传贯彻政策，稳定农村各阶层生产情绪，切实解决农民生产、生活上的困难，及时防止与战胜各种自然灾害，抓紧时机进行中耕、追肥、秋收、秋耕、秋种工作。互助合作方面必须继续克服急躁冒进情绪，防止与纠正放任自流偏向。同时，必须加强调查研究工作，加强党委的统一领导，提高干部思想政策水平，有效地改进工作方法。此外，应积极帮助农民推销土、特产品，改进合作社的供销工作，活跃农村经济。（本报西南记者站）
