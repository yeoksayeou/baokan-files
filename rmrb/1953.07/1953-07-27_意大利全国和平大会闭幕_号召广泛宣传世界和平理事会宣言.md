Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 24th: The Italian National Peace Congress concluded on July 23rd. Many people spoke at the plenary session, including Pietro Nenni and Emilio Sereni.

    Nenni said that recent international events, especially the achievements in the Korean armistice negotiations, have greatly encouraged peace fighters to continue the struggle until final victory. Nenni pointed out that the progress and victory of the forces of peace have created favorable conditions for further struggle for international peace and friendship.

    Subsequently, the rapporteurs of the four groups of the Congress made reports. Finally, Sereni spoke, summarizing the work of the Congress. He said that the main feature of the world peace movement now is the unity of the broad masses of the people, as well as the unity of entire nations, entire countries, and governments, such as the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, which have all used their powerful forces to serve peace.

    Sereni talked about the need to carry out various activities to widely promote the declaration of the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting in Italy, and the need to organize the masses to take practical actions to strive for consultations between major powers. Sereni called on peace fighters to establish contacts with all businessmen who want to do business with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, and to establish contacts with cultural workers.

    Sereni concluded by saying that the peace movement demands that the Italian government truly reflect the universal desire for peace of the vast majority of voters, regardless of their party affiliation.

    接着，大会四个小组的报告人作了报告。最后，塞伦尼发言，总结了大会的工作。他说，现在世界和平运动的主要特征是团结了广大的人民群众，也团结了整个民族、整个国家和政府，像苏联、中国和人民民主国家等，它们已把自己的强大力量都用来为和平而服务。
    塞伦尼谈到必须进行各种活动，在意大利广泛宣传世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的宣言，必须组织群众以实际行动来争取大国举行协商。塞伦尼号召和平战士们要与所有想和苏联、中国和人民民主国家做生意的商人建立联系，与文化工作者建立联系。
    塞伦尼最后说，和平运动要求意大利政府能真正地反映绝大多数选民要求和平的普遍愿望，不管他们属于什么党派。
