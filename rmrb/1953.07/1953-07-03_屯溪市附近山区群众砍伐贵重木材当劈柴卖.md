    Mountain People Near Tunxi City Chop Down Valuable Timber for Firewood Sales
    Wu Xiang of the Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's Forest Survey Team writes: We recently conducted a forest survey in the Tunxi City area of Anhui Province and discovered that local mountain people are chopping down masson pines with diameters of 20 to 30 centimeters and carrying them to Tunxi to sell as firewood. This practice of using large timber for small purposes and valuable timber for inferior purposes is a regrettable waste. However, according to local people, they have requested the People's Government to purchase timber here, but this has not been possible due to transportation difficulties. In order to solve their livelihood problems, the people have no choice but to cut down trees and sell them. Based on this situation, I suggest that the local People's Government actively find ways to lead and assist the people in engaging in other sideline production to solve their livelihood problems in order to preserve this valuable timber.

    屯溪市附近山区群众砍伐贵重木材当劈柴卖
    安徽省农林厅林野调查队武湘来信：我们最近到安徽省屯溪市一带进行林野调查，发现当地山区群众砍伐直径二三十公分的马尾松，挑到屯溪当劈柴卖。这种大材小用、优材劣用的做法是一种很可惜的浪费。但据当地群众说，他们曾要求人民政府来这里收购木材，因运输困难，未能如愿。而群众为了解决生活问题，不能不砍伐林木出卖。根据这一情况，我建议当地人民政府积极设法领导和协助群众从事其他副业生产解决生活问题，以保存这部分贵重的木材。
