Correcting the Decentralized and Rash Tendencies of Various Departments
Beijing Reduces Construction Project Plans

Due to the fact that various departments engaged in construction in Beijing were acting independently and rushing ahead blindly, Beijing's construction tasks for this year were excessively large, far exceeding actual possibilities, resulting in a significant portion of the construction tasks being impossible to complete. The Central Government has now taken measures to stop this tendency of rashness and decentralization.

This year, Beijing's construction tasks, including projects carried over from 1952, have reached over 3.8 million square meters. Among these, the construction undertaken by various central departments amounts to over 3.2 million square meters, accounting for approximately 85 percent. In addition to the North China Directly Subordinate Engineering Company and the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, there are also more than 50 construction engineering units affiliated with various central departments, each undertaking this massive construction task.

In terms of construction area, Beijing's construction tasks this year are equivalent to more than one-quarter of Beijing's existing housing. In terms of the modernization level of the buildings, it is incomparably higher. Of the 2.07 million square meters of construction undertaken by the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau alone, reinforced concrete structures account for 25 percent, with the majority being buildings of five stories or more, with the highest reaching nine stories. Mixed-structure buildings account for approximately 60 percent, the vast majority of which are three-story buildings. Brick-and-wood structures account for only 15 percent of all new buildings. So many buildings are needed in Beijing, and some are urgently needed; however, it far exceeds the possibilities of Beijing's existing subjective and objective conditions, making it absolutely impossible to complete this year, resulting in a highly rash plan.

First, the quantity and quality of design personnel are fundamentally insufficient. Especially for high-rise buildings and certain modern equipment, existing designers have never designed them, nor have they undergone typical testing. Even if they manage to draw up the plans, the designers themselves are not confident.

Second, many construction engineering units are still in a state of chaos. The leadership and the workforce are both still very disorganized. It is necessary to strengthen leadership and rectify the workforce while simultaneously carrying out construction. At the same time, the workers' technical skills and the cadres' management experience are not commensurate with the tasks they are now undertaking.

Third, the total weight of materials needed for construction is approximately 7.6 million tons. Only 2 million tons have been transported to the construction sites; the remaining 5.6 million tons must be concentrated and transported within five months from May to October. This would require 12,500 large horse-drawn carts or 2,500 trucks operating rain or shine every day; however, Beijing's capacity to provide transportation for construction falls far short of this number. Although some central departments have transferred some transport trucks, the overall transportation capacity is significantly lacking, and the existing roads are insufficient for use.

Fourth, there are significant difficulties in supplying water and electricity during construction and after the completion of the projects. In particular, since the vast majority of construction plans were finalized long after the municipal engineering plan for this year was determined, water and electricity supplies cannot be caught up this year.

Fifth, some materials and equipment either cannot be supplied in time or are not guaranteed to be available at all.

Sixth, and more seriously, it is necessary to acquire a lot of land, relocate many graves, demolish some residential buildings, and resettle many farmers. Most of these tasks were only proposed in March and April. Within such a short period, it is difficult to properly handle a series of issues such as land acquisition and the transition and resettlement of farmers in the suburbs.

Currently, the state of Beijing's construction projects can be summarized in sixteen characters: "acting independently, rushing ahead blindly, passive chaos, blaming each other." Of such a large task, only 300,000 square meters were determined in January, 1.2 million square meters were determined in February, and the remaining 2-plus million square meters were only determined in March and April. Many units are eager for quick success and rush ahead impetuously, acquiring land, designing, and constructing simultaneously, even starting construction without technical designs being reviewed at all; many places violate basic construction procedures and financial regulations. Continuing to act blindly and anarchically like this will not only fail to guarantee the completion of the projects that must be completed this year but will also inevitably result in astonishing waste and substandard quality, leading to irreparable losses.

This serious state of rashness and decentralization in Beijing's construction projects must be changed quickly; we must proceed from the current actual situation, adhere to the principle of quality first, and act according to our capabilities; we must take firm steps to stop this tendency of rashness. Now, the Central Government has instructed Beijing to re-examine all construction plans of various departments in the Beijing area for 1953, and to arrange them according to the conditions of need and possibility: those that are not needed or can be built elsewhere than Beijing should be resolutely reduced; those that can be postponed this year and whose preparatory work is not yet complete should be postponed, and construction should be carried out next year after sufficient preparation; important projects that must be completed this year and have the conditions to be completed must be guaranteed to be completed.

Secondly, the Central Government stipulates that all departments at the central and North China levels that carry out construction projects within the Beijing area must obey the unified leadership of Beijing and abide by various regulations of the Beijing Municipal People's Government regarding construction projects. We must resolutely overcome the chaotic phenomena and blind impetuosity in construction projects.

Regarding the issue of land occupation for construction, Beijing is instructed to convene a meeting for various departments to discuss and determine specific methods, and the relevant departments are instructed to strictly comply. The most important thing is that the compensation to farmers for occupied land must be appropriate, and resettlement must be properly arranged.

Finally, since Beijing's construction projects have been related to urban planning issues in many aspects (such as regional division, road systems, architectural styles, water and electricity supply, etc.), the Central Government has instructed Beijing to propose a draft urban planning scheme to facilitate future capital construction and construction management.

### 纠正各部门分散和冒进倾向  北京市削减建筑工程计划

    纠正各部门分散和冒进倾向
    北京市削减建筑工程计划
    由于在北京市进行建筑的各个部门各自为政、盲目冒进，北京市今年的建筑任务过分庞大，远远超过了实际可能，以致相当大的一部分建筑任务根本不可能完成。现中央已采取措施，停止这种冒进与分散倾向。
    今年北京市建筑任务连同一九五二年跨年度工程在内，已达三百八十余万平方公尺。其中，中央各部门的建筑三百二十余万平方公尺，约占百分之八十五。除华北直属工程公司和北京市建筑工程局以外，尚有中央各部门所属五十多个建筑工程单位，分别担负这个庞大的建筑任务。
    今年北京市的建筑任务，从建筑面积上看，相当于北京市现有房屋的四分之一以上。从房屋现代化的程度上看，则高得不可比拟。仅北京建筑工程局二百零七万平方公尺的建筑任务中，钢筋混凝土结构的工程即占百分之二十五，其中多数为五层以上的建筑，最高有达九层的；混合结构的工程约占百分之六十，其中绝大部分是三层楼房；砖木结构的只占全部新建房屋的百分之十五。这样多的建筑物在北京是需要的，并且有一些是迫切需要的；但它却远远地超过了北京现有的主观和客观条件的可能，今年是绝对不可能完成的，是一种十分冒进的计划。
    第一、设计人员的数量和质量根本不够。尤其高层大建筑和某些近代化设备，现有的设计师根本没有设计过，又没有经过典型试验，即使勉强画出图来，连设计人自己也没有把握。
    第二、许多建筑工程单位还处在混乱状态，领导和工人队伍都还很混乱，必须一面加强领导、整顿工人队伍，一面施工。同时，工人的技术水平、干部的管理经验都和他们现在所担负的任务不相称。
    第三、建筑所需材料的重量，总计约有七百六十万吨。现已运至工地者仅二百万吨；其余五百六十万吨要集中在五月到十月的五个月内运送，每天要有一万二千五百辆大车或二千五百辆汽车风雨无阻地赶运才成；而北京市能够投入建筑运输的大车和汽车远不足此数；虽然中央有些部门已经调来一些运输汽车，但总的说来，运输力相差甚大，而且现有道路也不够使用。
    第四、施工中和工程完成后，水电供应都有很大困难。特别是因为绝大部分建筑计划是在本年市政工程计划定下来很久以后才确定的，水电供应等今年已无法赶上。
    第五、部分材料和设备，有的不能及时供应，有的根本没有把握。
    第六、更严重的是为此要收购很多土地，迁移很多坟墓，拆迁一些民房，安置许多农民。而这些任务绝大部分是在三四月份才提出来的，在这样短的时间内，要妥当地处理购地与郊区农民的转业、居住等一系列问题是困难的。
    现在，北京市建筑工程进行的情况，可以用“各自为政、盲目冒进、被动混乱、互相埋怨”十六个字来概括。这样大的任务，一月份确定了的只有三十万平方公尺，二月份确定了一百二十万平方公尺，其余二百几十万平方公尺都是在三四月份才确定的。许多单位急于求成、急躁冒进，边购地、边设计、边施工，甚至技术设计根本无人审核即动工；许多地方违反基本建设程序和财政制度。这样盲目地无政府地干下去，一方面今年必须完成的工程无法保证完成，一方面必然产生惊人的浪费和质量低下的恶果，招致不可补救的损失。
    北京市建筑工程这种严重的冒进和分散状况必须迅速改变；必须从当前的实际情况出发，坚持质量第一的方针，量力而行；必须采取坚决步骤，停止这种冒进的倾向。现在，中央已责成北京市重新审查一九五三年度所有各部门在北京市地区的建筑计划，根据需要与可能的条件加以安排：凡不需要或可以不在北京市建筑者，应坚决予以削减；凡本年度可以缓建和准备工作尚未完备者，应予推迟，作充分准备后明年再施工；凡必须在本年内完成而又有条件可能完成的重要工程，必须保证完成。
    其次，中央规定中央与华北一级的各部门，凡在北京市范围内进行建筑工程者，均须服从北京市的统一领导和遵守北京市人民政府有关建筑工程的各种规定，必须坚决克服建筑工程中的混乱现象和盲目冒进的偏向。
    关于建筑占地的问题，责成北京市召集会议，由各部门共同讨论定出具体办法，责成有关部门严格遵守。其中最主要的是占用土地时对农民的偿付必须适当，安置必须妥善。
    最后，由于目前北京市的建筑工程已在很多方面（如区域划分、道路系统、建筑形式、水电供应等）联系到都市规则问题，中央责成北京市要提出一个城市规则的草案，以便于今后进行首都建设和建筑管理。
