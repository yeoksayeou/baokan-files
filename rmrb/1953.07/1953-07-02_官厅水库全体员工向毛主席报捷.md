All 40,000 employees involved in the construction of the Guanting Reservoir project wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting the successful completion of this year's pre-flood season engineering plan, ensuring flood control during the flood season.

The letter first reported to Chairman Mao the good news that the Guanting Reservoir project, currently the largest reservoir in New China by volume, could begin to block floods during this year's flood season. It stated: This is thanks to your kind attention and the superb technical assistance of Soviet experts. After one year and eight months of intense effort, and overcoming numerous difficulties in construction, we have achieved this great victory. This victory means that the people on both sides of the Yongding River are beginning to escape the disasters of frequent floods and move towards a happy life.

The letter stated: Since the commencement of the Guanting Reservoir project in October 1951, we have been striving to achieve the goal of blocking floods before the flood season this year. During the construction process, the employees adopted a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to overcome many difficulties. Under the battle cry of "racing against time, fighting against floods," work never stopped. When the flood season came last year, the water diversion tunnel project was undergoing intensive reinforced concrete lining. The flood level outside the tunnel exceeded the height of the tunnel entrance by eight meters, and there was a lot of water seepage inside the tunnel, but the employees persisted in working inside the tunnel. When the temporary dam was closed, the employees braved the severe cold of minus seventeen degrees Celsius and scooped up soil bags in waist-deep water, finally making the Yongding River's flow conform to the will of the people and flow into the tunnel. The letter stated: When excavating the foundation of the dam, it was the height of winter, and the employees also waged a arduous struggle against the severe cold and the large amount of underground seepage. In about one hundred days, they dug twenty-two meters deep from the riverbed. During the construction of the dam, a large-scale patriotic labor competition was launched, and everyone actively contributed their wisdom and strength, found shortcuts, tapped potential, learned from Soviet advanced experience, and created and promoted many advanced operating methods, enabling the dam to be built to a height of thirty-five meters on schedule. More than two thousand employees became models and were credited for their achievements.

The letter stated: Now, the employees see the thirty-five-meter-high dam standing at the entrance of the Guanting Gorge, enough to block the flood of the Yongding River, and they feel unspeakable joy in their hearts. The employees consider it an unparalleled honor that this huge project could block floods in just one year and eight months.

The letter concluded by assuring Chairman Mao: Now, the employees, with greater confidence, continue to redouble their efforts, without arrogance or impatience, and strive to complete the entire Guanting Reservoir project in the spring of next year.

    官厅水库全体员工向毛主席报捷
    【新华社一日讯】修建官厅水库工程的四万员工，写信向毛主席报告胜利完成今年伏汛前的工程计划，确保汛期拦阻洪水。
    信中首先向毛主席报告了新中国目前容积最大的水库——官厅水库工程在今年伏汛期可以开始拦阻洪水的好消息，并说：这是在您的亲切关怀和苏联专家的精湛技术帮助下，我们经过一年零八个月的紧张努力，克服了施工中的重重困难，才获得这个巨大的胜利。这一胜利，使永定河两岸的人民开始摆脱过去经常遭受洪水的灾难，走向幸福的生活。
    信中说：官厅水库工程自一九五一年十月间开工以来，一直为了达到今年汛前拦阻洪水目的而奋斗。施工过程中，员工们采取革命的精神和革命的办法，克服了许多困难。在“与时间赛跑，与洪水斗争”的战斗口号下，从没有停止过工作。去年汛期洪水到来时，输水隧洞工程正在紧张地进行钢筋混凝土衬砌，洞外的洪水位已超过洞口的高度八公尺，洞内渗水很多，但员工们一直在洞内坚持工作；在临时挡水坝合龙闭气的时候，员工们冒着零下十七度的严寒，在漫腰深水中捞土袋子，终于使永定河的河流顺从了人们的意志，流入隧洞。信中说：开挖拦河坝基础时，正是隆冬腊月，员工们同样和严寒、和地下大量渗水进行了艰苦的斗争，在一百来天里，从河底挖下二十二公尺深。建筑拦河坝工程中，展开了大规模的爱国主义劳动竞赛，每个人都积极贡献出自己的智慧和力量，找窍门，挖潜力，学习苏联先进经验，创造和推广了很多先进的操作方法，使拦河坝按期筑到三十五公尺高。员工中有二千多人当上了模范，立了功。
    信中说：现在，员工们看到三十五公尺高的拦河坝屹立在官厅山峡进口，足以拦阻住永定河的洪水，心里都有说不出的喜悦。这个巨大工程能在短短的一年零八个月里拦阻洪水，员工们引为无尚光荣。
    信中最后向毛主席提出保证说：现在，员工们怀着更大的信心，继续加倍努力，不骄不躁，为明年春季全部完成官厅水库工程而奋斗。
