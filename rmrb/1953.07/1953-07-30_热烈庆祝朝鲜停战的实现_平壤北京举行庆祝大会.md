Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 29th: Over 110,000 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand rally and demonstration parade on the 28th to warmly celebrate the realization of the Korean armistice. Marshal Kim Il-sung attended the rally and delivered an important speech.

On this day, the weather in Pyongyang cleared after a long spell of rain. Before dawn, the vast ranks of workers, farmers, youth, women, students, and government employees from the Pyongyang area, who had made enormous sacrifices and contributions in the battles to resist aggression and defend peace, converged on the central district of Pyongyang from all directions. The rally venue was located in a square in the center of Pyongyang, extending from Stalin Street to the banks of the Taedong River, a vast and clean area covering one li square. It was hastily repaired by the working people of Pyongyang in two days and nights of rain. The tall rostrum was decorated solemnly, magnificently, and beautifully. The national flags of Korea, the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democracies fluttered in the wind. A white wooden wall on the front of the rostrum was hung with the national emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and giant portraits of Lenin, Stalin, Kim Il-sung, Malenkov, and Mao Zedong.

Near noon, the crowds coming from all directions had lined up neatly in the square. On the reviewing stands on both sides of the rostrum were combat heroes of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as labor heroes from the production front. Also on the reviewing stand were responsible persons from various democratic parties and mass organizations, prominent figures from society, representatives of the working people of the Pyongyang area, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Korea.

At twelve noon, the leader of the Korean people, Marshal Kim Il-sung, walked onto the rostrum, and thunderous cheers and applause erupted in the square. Following him onto the rostrum were Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; Park Jung-ai, Park Chang-ok, and Kim Il, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea; Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Choi Yong-kun, Choi Chang-ik, Jung Il-ryong, and Park Ui-wan; and heads of various ministries and departments of the Cabinet.

Two members of the Young Pioneers ran onto the rostrum and presented flowers to Marshal Kim Il-sung. Then, Jung Yun-pyo, Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, announced the opening of the rally, and the military band played "The Patriotic Song."

Amidst the cheers that resounded throughout the venue, Marshal Kim Il-sung began to deliver a speech to the entire Korean army and people (an abstract of the speech will be issued separately). Marshal Kim Il-sung warmly congratulated the entire army and people on the great victory in the heroic struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace. Marshal Kim Il-sung called on the entire army and people to heighten their vigilance and guard against the enemy's renewed military adventures and trampling on peace, and to advance under the slogan "Everything for strengthening the democratic base and restoring and developing the post-war people's economy!"

At 1:15 PM, the rally ended. To the strains of "The Patriotic Song" played by the military band, the magnificent demonstration parade of 110,000 working people of the heroic city of Pyongyang began.

At the forefront of the demonstration procession were fifty colorfully decorated vehicles filled with Young Pioneers. As the vehicles approached the rostrum, the Young Pioneers raised high portraits of Lenin, Stalin, Kim Il-sung, Malenkov, and Mao Zedong, as well as the national flags of Korea, the Soviet Union, and China, while shouting "Long Live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" The valiant youth队伍[duì wu - ranks, contingent] came next, holding high the national flags and portraits of leaders from various people's democracies. They also held eye-catching giant banners. The girls continuously threw flowers at the combat heroes of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies standing on the reviewing stand. Next came the ranks of the workers. The workers carried machine models and production charts, with curves marking the rapid rise in production achievements. Among the ranks of over 2,800 railway workers were charts showing the over-fulfillment of the train operation plan year by year for the past three years, ensuring wartime railway transportation. Next was the ranks of the Korean Workers' Party, which has over one million members. Behind them were the ranks of the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland and various democratic parties and social organizations such as workers, farmers, youth, and women. The marchers advanced shouting slogans. Among the ranks of students from all levels of schools, there were over three hundred recipients of medals. The female students in the队伍 danced Korean national dances as they marched. After the processions of government organs and literary and artistic groups passed, the farmers' procession immediately followed. The farmers held charts showing increased agricultural production and shouted the slogan "Increase grain production to defend the motherland!" Overseas Chinese farmers performed the yangko dance as they marched, earning warm applause.

As the parade procession passed the rostrum, they warmly cheered and paid their respects to Marshal Kim Il-sung and the party and government leaders on the stage. Marshal Kim Il-sung constantly applauded the marchers and raised his hand in reply.

After the magnificent demonstration procession left the square, it marched along all the main thoroughfares of Pyongyang to the sound of military music. The sidewalks on both sides of the streets were crowded with men, women, old and young, who shouted along with the parade procession: "Long live the victory of the Korean people!" "Long live the Korean Workers' Party!" "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" "Glory to the heroic Korean and Chinese People's Armies!"
