Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam Dispatch from Vietnam News Agency: In early June, President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam awarded the Second Class Resistance Medal to the people and war service personnel of Vinh Phuc Province, recognizing their significant achievements since the end of 1952 in restoring agricultural production in uninhabited areas, protecting grain, developing production in liberated areas, promoting guerrilla warfare, and supporting the front lines.

    For example, in repairing river dikes to ensure production and safety, the people of Vinh Phuc Province began repairing many river dikes within the province as early as March of this year. In Vinh Phuc Province, north of Hanoi, most of the river dikes are located in enemy-occupied and guerrilla areas, and therefore, people in enemy-occupied and guerrilla areas were often subjected to artillery fire and obstruction from the French army when repairing the dikes. Despite this, they overcame many difficulties and were finally able to repair the dikes before the rainy season floods in May, just like the people in the liberated areas.

    In early June, the people of Vinh Phuc Province held a conference to summarize their experience in protecting the river dikes and reported their achievements to President Ho Chi Minh.

    胡志明主席授给越南永福省人民抗战勋章
    奖励他们在恢复无人区的生产等方面获得成绩
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府在六月初以二级抗战勋章授给永福省人民和战争勤务工作人员，奖励他们从一九五二年年底以来，在恢复无人区的农业生产、保护谷物、发展解放区生产、推进游击战和支援前线等方面的显著成绩。
    例如在修补河堤以保证生产和安全方面，永福省人民早在今年三月间就开始修补省境内的许多河堤。在河内以北的永福省，大部分河堤都在敌占区和游击区内，因而敌占区和游击区人民在修堤的时候，经常遭到法军的炮轰和阻扰。虽然这样，他们克服了重重困难，终于能和解放区人民一样，在五月的雨季洪水期前将河堤修补完毕。
    六月初，永福省人民召开了一次会议，总结保护河堤的经验，同时将他们的成绩报告给胡志明主席。
