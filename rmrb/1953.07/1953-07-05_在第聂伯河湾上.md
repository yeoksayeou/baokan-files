　　On the Bend of the Dnieper River

　　In mid-June, the bend of the Dnieper River near Kakhovka in the lower reaches was still overflowing with spring floods. This year, the river rose almost three meters, with a higher water level than usual, submerging everything in its path. As in the past, the tops of submerged trees and plants along the riverbank were visible above the water, like green islands in a vast expanse of water. But this year, in addition to these "islands," a long peninsula has also appeared, stubbornly jutting out from the bank into the heart of the river. Proudly flying on the peninsula is the Stakhanovite concrete workers' rotating red flag. This is part of one of the great communist construction projects of the Soviet Union—the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station construction site. Heroic builders have used cofferdams and steel piles to block the raging spring floods, opening up such a peninsula-style construction site so that construction work has not stopped for a minute.

　　Many of the builders of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station participated in the construction of the Lenin Hydroelectric Power Station on the Dnieper River (then the largest hydroelectric power station in Europe) from 1927 to 1932. Therefore, they are very familiar with the character of this famous third largest river in Europe. They not only have to block the river water from hindering their work but also to control it with more dams, spillways, and turbines to make it serve the people's welfare. When the entire project is completed, a thirty-five-meter-high earth dam will span the Dnieper River. Its extension will be a reinforced concrete spillway and a power plant with five turbines and five large generators. Adjacent to this will be a navigation lock. The entire hydraulic structure spanning the river will be 4,500 meters long. It will be like a sturdy arm controlling the waters of the Dnieper. Upon completion of the project, a large reservoir capable of storing 14 billion cubic meters of water will appear in an area over 25 kilometers wide and 250 kilometers long. The water in this reservoir will drive the turbines of the power plant, which has a generating capacity of 250,000 kilowatts and can generate 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours per year, almost reaching the total power generation of all large power stations in Tsarist Russia. Controlling such a large force is equivalent to harnessing 500,000 horses, making them work tirelessly for the people day and night. This is the task that the builders of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station will complete by 1956. However, they have made a guarantee to complete this glorious and great task ahead of schedule.

　　"Let us complete the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station one year ahead of schedule!"—This was the resounding slogan put forward by the builders on the eve of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union last year. Since then, this slogan has been echoing throughout the entire construction site, arousing fiery enthusiasm in everyone. Since then, many outstanding labor achievements have appeared one after another on the honor roll, shining brightly.

　　At the end of last year, the workers operating hydraulic machinery launched a movement to implement a more precise work schedule. The implementation of this work schedule not only doubled labor productivity but also improved work quality and reduced costs. Under the difficult conditions of winter, the operators of the suction dredgers completed their work quota three weeks ahead of schedule, excavating the foundation pits for the spillway dam and the power plant. During the days of mourning for the great Stalin, a large number of work teams doubled or tripled their work quotas. The first construction site to start concrete work was the foundation pit of the lock. The work team led by the famous concrete worker V. Demchenko had only poured the first batch of concrete on the construction site on March 30, but now, a huge building made of concrete slabs and steel frames has been erected in the lock's foundation pit. The work teams led by advanced workers such as Demchenko, Chebanenko, and Zaitsev are no longer completing dozens of cubic meters of concrete per shift but are pouring two to three hundred cubic meters of concrete per shift. Now, the competition to pour 300 cubic meters of concrete per shift per work team has been launched on the construction site, and the bright rotating red flag is fluttering in the workplaces of the victors.

　　The heroic laborers on the Dnieper River are using this spirit to complete the task one year ahead of schedule, so that the river water rushing like ten thousand horses will drive the huge turbines earlier. By then, the electricity of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station will drive a large number of pumping stations to irrigate 800,000 hectares (approximately 12 million mu) of land, and mechanize and electrify the most important production processes of thousands of collective farms. A large number of electric tractors, electric harvesting combines, and other agricultural machines equipped with electric motors will appear in the fields of southern Ukraine. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 在第聂伯河湾上

    在第聂伯河湾上
    六月中旬，第聂伯河下游卡霍夫卡附近的河湾处，还溢漫着春汛的洪流。今年的河水几乎涨了三公尺，水头比平常高，淹没了挡在它道路上的一切。像过去一样，河岸上被淹没的草木的梢头露在水面上，好像是在一片汪洋中的绿色岛屿。但在今年，除了这些“岛屿”以外，这里还出现了一个长形的半岛，它顽强地从岸边插入河心。半岛上骄傲地飘扬着斯大哈诺夫式混凝土工人获得的流动红旗。这就是苏联伟大共产主义建设工程之一——卡霍夫卡水电站工地的一部分。英勇的建筑者们用拒水堰和钢椿拦开了汹涌的春洪，开辟了这样一个半岛式的工地，让建筑工程一分钟也没有停顿。
    卡霍夫卡水电站的建筑者中，有许多人曾在一九二七—一九三二年参加过第聂伯河上列宁水电站（当时欧洲最大的水电站）的建设工作。因此，他们对于这条著名的欧洲第三条大河性格是非常熟悉的。他们不仅要拦住河水不让它妨碍自己的工作，而且要用更多的堤坝，用溢洪道和透平来控制它，使它为人民的福利服务。在全部工程完成后，一条三十五公尺高的土筑堤坝，将横跨第聂伯河。它的延长部分就是钢筋混凝土的放水堰，以及装有五座透平、五座大发电机的一个发电厂。和这相邻的就是通航水闸。这全部横跨河身的水力建筑物，四周围将有四千五百公尺长。它将像一只粗壮的臂膀，把第聂伯的河水控制起来。在工程完工时，在宽度超过二十五公里、长度达二百五十公里的地区，将出现一个能蓄水一百四十亿公方的大水库。这座水库的水将推动发电厂的透平，透平的发电能力为二十五万瓩，每年可以发电十二亿瓩时，差不多达到沙俄时代所有大电力站的发电量的总和。控制了这样大的力量，就等于驾御了五十万匹马，使它们昼夜不停地为人民工作。这就是卡霍夫卡水电站建筑者们到一九五六年所要完成的任务。但是，他们却提出了保证，要提前完成这个光荣而伟大的任务。
    “让我们提前一年完成卡霍夫卡水电站！”——这是建筑者们去年在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会前夕提出的响亮口号。从那时起，这个口号一直在整个工程的工地上回响着，激起了每一个人的火一般的热情。从那时起，许多卓越的劳动成就，接二连三地在光荣榜上出现，发出光芒。
    在去年年尾，操使水力机械设备的工人们，曾发起了实行更精密的工作进度表的运动。实行这个工作进度表，不仅使劳动生产率增加一倍，而且能够改进工作质量和减低成本。在冬季的困难条件下，吸泥机的操使者提前三星期完成了工作定额，为溢洪道大堤和电力厂挖掘好了基坑。在悼念伟大的斯大林的日子里，大批工作队把他们的工作定额提高了一倍到两倍。工地上最先开始混凝土工程的工地是水闸的基坑。著名混凝土工人维·杰姆钦科领导的工作队，在三月三十日不过才在工地上浇灌第一批混凝土，但现在，水闸基坑中已经竖起了用混凝土板和钢架做成的庞大建筑物。杰姆钦科、契巴宁科、扎伊泽夫等先进工作者领导的工作队，已不是在每班完成几十公方混凝土的任务，而是每班浇灌两、三百公方的混凝土。现在，争取每一工作队每班浇灌三百公方混凝土的竞赛，已在工地上展开了，鲜明的流动红旗招展在胜利者的工作地方。
    第聂伯河上的英雄劳动者们，就是要用这样的精神来提前一年完成任务，要使那万马奔腾的河水提早推动巨大的透平。到那时，卡霍夫卡水电站的电力将推动大批机器抽水站的机械，来灌溉八十万公顷（约合一千二百万市亩）的土地，并且让千百个集体农庄最重要的生产过程机械化和电气化。乌克兰南部的田野上将出现大批电动拖拉机、电动收割联合机和其他装有电动机的农业机器。（新华社）
