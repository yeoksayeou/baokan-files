Response from the People's Education Publishing House Regarding the Issue of Textbook Waste

A letter from the People's Education Publishing House: In the "Reader's Letters Abstract" column of your newspaper on June 6th, Comrade Sun Fuqing of the Xinhua Bookstore Hunan Branch pointed out in his letter: In the autumn of 1953, the national primary schools implemented a system of transitioning spring semester classes to autumn semester classes. A portion of the three types of textbooks for one academic year used in the fifth and sixth grades (higher primary school arithmetic, nature, and geography) issued in the spring of 1953 were wasted. This criticism is correct. The main reason for this situation is that our publishing house did not coordinate sufficiently with the Central Ministry of Education. Our publishing house was not informed in a timely manner about the Central Ministry of Education's decision regarding this class transition and therefore did not make appropriate adjustments in terms of textbook supply. By the time our publishing house learned of this decision, the higher primary school textbooks for one academic year had already been published and distributed.

This is an issue that affects the interests of a broad number of students. The Second National Education Work Conference recently convened by the Central Ministry of Education has thoroughly studied this issue. The final decision is: the "Higher Primary School Arithmetic" textbook, which had been decided to be discontinued in the autumn of 1953, will continue to be used, with our publishing house compiling and printing a list of corrections. A newly compiled edition of "Higher Primary School Nature" will be published in the autumn of 1953, and "Higher Primary School Geography" has undergone significant changes and must be replaced with new books. This approach will reduce some waste. The Central Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Publications have issued a joint notice according to this approach.

Our country's primary school textbooks have traditionally been issued one volume per semester. Our publishing house absorbed Soviet experience and began issuing higher primary school textbooks as one volume per academic year in the spring of 1953. Before the change, our publishing house conducted thorough research and collected opinions from all parties. The advantages of the change are: teachers can master the entire year's teaching material, strengthening the breadth and depth of the teaching progress plan. Students can review what they learned in the previous semester at any time during the second semester, which is conducive to consolidating learning outcomes. The original distribution work, which was done twice a year, can be simplified to once, and the administrative work of schools and the Xinhua Bookstore in the distribution and management of textbooks can also be reduced by half. The cover paper and cover printing productivity of textbooks can be saved by half, reducing the book price by an average of 7 percent. This time, due to the class transition, it is necessary to replace the two higher primary school textbooks, nature and geography, causing a significant waste, which was indeed not considered at the time. However, the advantages of using one textbook per academic year outweigh the disadvantages, and it should not be rejected "because of one bad experience."

### 人民教育出版社对浪费教科书问题的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    人民教育出版社对浪费教科书问题的答复
    人民教育出版社来信：六月六日你报“读者来信摘要”栏发表了新华书店湖南分店孙富卿同志的来信，信中指出：一九五三年秋季实行全国小学春季始业班编级为秋季始业班，一九五三年春季所发行的五年级、六年级用一学年的高小算术、自然、地理三种用书就有一部分浪费了。这个批评是正确的。造成这种情况的原因，主要是我社和中央教育部工作上联系不够：中央教育部这个编级的决定，我社没有及时知悉，因而没有在教材供应上作适当的配合；到我社知道这个决定的时候，一学年用的高小用书早已出版发行了。
    这是一个涉及广大学生利益的问题。最近中央教育部召开的第二次全国教育工作会议周密地研究过这个问题，最后的决定是：把已决定在一九五三年秋季停用的“高小算术”一种改为仍可照用，而由我社另编勘误表订正；“高小自然”在一九五三年秋季有新编本出版，“高小地理”改动甚多，均必须换用新书。这样处理，可以减少一部分浪费。中央教育部、出版总署已按这个处理办法发出联合通知。
    我国小学课本历来是一学期用一册的；我社吸收苏联的经验，在一九五三年春季开始把高小用书改为一学年用一册。变更之前，我社曾经作周密的研究并搜集了各方面的意见。变更后的好处是：教师可以掌握全年的教材，加强教学进度计划的宽度和深度。学生在第二学期学习时可以随时复习上学期学过的东西，对巩固学习成果有利。原来一学年两次的发行工作，可以简化为一次，学校行政方面和新华书店对课本的分配管理等事务工作也可以减轻一半。教科书的封面用纸和封面印刷生产力可节省一半，平均降低书价百分之七。这次因编级而必须另换高小自然、地理两种课本，造成一笔很大的浪费，确是当时所没有考虑到的。但一学年用一册教科书的办法优点多于缺点，不应“因噎废食”而加以否定。
