Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th Dispatch: "Pravda" continues to report that working people in major cities across the country are holding gatherings to discuss the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the traitor Beria. Those present angrily condemned the crimes of Beria, the enemy of the Party and the people, and unanimously and enthusiastically supported the decision of the Party Central Committee's plenary session and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. "Pravda" also published news that the Stalinabad, Lysenko, Tula, Dnepropetrovsk, and other state and city committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held plenary sessions to discuss the summaries of the CPSU Central Committee plenary session.

    "Pravda" wrote in an editorial entitled "Strictly Abide by the Principle of Collective Leadership": The joint plenary sessions held by the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the state committees, city committees, and district committees of the Party, together with Party activists, strongly demonstrated the iron-like unity of the Party ranks, indicating that the Party is closely united around its Central Committee. Those participating in these meetings expressed the will of the entire Party and all the Soviet people, angrily condemning the crimes of Beria, the enemy of the Party and the people, and agent of international imperialism. These meetings fully supported the timely and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee to liquidate Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes, considering them to be the only correct measures. "Pravda" continued by saying that the plenary sessions of Party committees at all levels, based on the instructions of the CPSU Central Committee—to draw political lessons from the Beria incident and make necessary conclusions to guide their future work—criticized the shortcomings of the Party organization's work and formulated measures to implement the tasks stipulated by the Party Central Committee. The plenary sessions paid great attention to raising the level of the Party's organizational and political work, strengthening the Party's leadership in all links of the Party and state organs, strictly adhering to the Party's leadership principles and the Party Constitution. "Pravda" emphasized: The supreme principle of our Party's leadership is the collectivity of leadership. The Party teaches us that only the collective political experience and collective wisdom of the Party Central Committee, based on the scientific principles of Marxist-Leninist theory, can guarantee the correct leadership of the Party and the state, guarantee the unwavering nature and unity of the Party ranks, and guarantee the victorious construction of communism in our country. The greatest strength of Party leadership lies in its collectivity.

    “真理报“发表题为“严格遵守集体领导的原则”的社论
    党的领导的最大力量就在于它的集体性
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十三日，“真理报”继续报道全国各大城市劳动人民集会讨论苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议关于叛徒贝利亚的决定。到会的人愤怒地谴责党和人民的敌人贝利亚的罪行，一致热烈地拥护党中央全体会议的决定和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议。“真理报”还登载了苏联共产党斯大林诺、利森、都拉、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克等州和市委员会举行全体会议，讨论苏共中央全体会议的总结的消息。
    “真理报”在题为“严格遵守集体领导的原则”的社论中写道：各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党的州委员会、市委员会和区委员会，会同党的活动分子举行的联合全体会议，强有力地表明了党队伍的钢铁般的团结，表示了党紧密地团结在自己的中央委员会的周围。参加这些会议的人，表示了整个党和全体苏联人民的意志，愤怒地谴责党和人民的敌人、国际帝国主义的代理人贝利亚的罪行。这些会议完全拥护党中央为清算贝利亚的反党和反国家罪行所采取的及时而坚决的措施，认为它是唯一正确的。“真理报”接着说，党各级委员会的全体会议，根据苏共中央的指示——从贝利亚事件中吸取政治教训，做出必要的结论，来指导自己今后的工作——批评了党组织的工作缺点，并拟定了执行党中央委员会规定的任务的措施。全体会议十分注意提高党的组织工作和政治工作的水平、加强党和国家机关一切环节中的党的领导、严格遵守党的领导原则和党章。“真理报”强调指出：我们党的领导的最高原则是领导的集体性。党教导我们说，只有根据马克思列宁主义理论的科学原则的党中央委员会的集体政治经验、集体智慧，才能保证正确地领导党和国家，才能保证党的队伍的不可动摇和团结，才能保证在我国胜利地建设共产主义。党的领导的最大力量就在于它的集体性。
