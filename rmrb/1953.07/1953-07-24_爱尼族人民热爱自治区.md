    The Aini People Love the Autonomous Region
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shang Wu
    In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, between Cheli County and Fo Hai County, lies a mountainous area where the hardworking and honest Aini people live. Counting from their ancestors, they have lived here for fifty-four generations. They were scattered into several areas by reactionary rulers and never had their own political power. When the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government Committee decided to help them establish an autonomous region, the good news spread like wind to every village in the mountains.

    However, where should the Autonomous Region People's Government be located? This was their first concern, and people hoped that the government would be located in their own village. The Aini people living in Yutang Village said: We have a fish pond here; if it is established here, our lives will be as good as the fish in the pond. There is a village nearby called Dazhai. The people who live there say: Establish it here! We have a large open space here where we can build tall houses. Nannuo Mountain and Suhu Mountain have even better conditions, and the arguments are even more intense. The people of Nannuo Mountain said: We produce the nationally famous "Pu'er Tea". There are lush tea gardens everywhere, and there is also a machine tea factory, so there will be great development prospects in the future. The people of Suhu Mountain said: The most important thing is that our location is the most central. It only takes one day to get to any place in the whole region, which will be convenient for future affairs. As a result, the government was established in Suhu Mountain, which won the approval of most villages. People from ten villages in the entire mountainous area chose a relatively flat area on the top of the mountain and began to build houses to welcome the birth of the Autonomous Region People's Government. The elderly people rushed to weave "grass rafts" (for building houses) day and night, and people came to the construction site every day. They wanted to level a large and flat area here so that girls from far and near could come here to celebrate and dance. They want to build a good house for the representatives to meet here.

    The People's Congress of All Circles began. Because their area had never had its own ethnic name, what should the autonomous region be called? The presidium and representatives were thinking about the most beautiful words in their ethnic language. Some said: Let's call it "Su Mai" (meaning great wealth), we will be rich here in the future. Some said: Let's call it "Zu Da La Mi" (meaning hopeful), when our grains grow well, we call it "Zu Da La Mi." Finally, someone proposed to call it "Gelang He" Aini Autonomous Region. Because "Gelang He" means a happy and promising future. They said: When our children are born safely, we happily call "Gelang He". Now Chairman Mao leads us, making us happy, and we will be even happier in the future.

    The members and chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government have been elected, and the Aini people are preparing to welcome the official establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government. Girls from many villages are rushing to make embroidered clothes, hanging bags, and leggings. On the day of the celebration of the establishment, people from forty-two villages within a radius of thirty to forty li came to participate. They beat ancient bronze gongs and blew gourd sheng. Everywhere in the square, you could see young militiamen wearing bright red headscarves and long knives, and girls adorned with silver ornaments. The girls from Jinzhu Village wore new embroidered clothes and personally hung many "shalongs" (flower thread tassels given to lovers) on the chairman's chest, expressing their love for the Autonomous Region People's Government. They and their partners formed a circle and sang and danced to their hearts' content. They sang:
    The sound of cicadas has changed,
    We have survived the bitter days.
    The sun shines high,
    Chairman Mao's truth has arrived,
    We will also have happiness in the mountains.

    爱尼族人民热爱自治区
    新华社记者  尚武
    在西双版纳傣族自治区境内，车里县和佛海县之间，有一片峰峦起伏的山区，聚居着勤劳纯朴的爱尼族人民。从他们的祖先算起，住在这里已有五十四代了。他们被反动统治者分散成好几个区域，从来就没有过自己的政权。当西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府委员会决定帮助他们建立自治区后，喜讯像风一样，迅速传遍了山区每一个村寨。
    但是，自治区人民政府设立在甚么地方呢？这是他们第一个关心的问题，人们都希望自治区政府设在自己的寨子里。住在鱼塘寨的爱尼族人们说：我们这里有个鱼塘，设立在我们这里，将来日子会像鱼塘里的鱼一样好过。附近有一个叫做大寨的村子，住在那里的人们说：设立在我们这里吧！我们这里有广阔的场子，可以盖高大的房子。南糯山和苏湖山，条件更好一些，人们的争论更激烈，南糯山的人说：我们这里出产全国闻名的“普洱茶”，这里到处都是茂密的茶园，还有机器制茶厂，将来发展前途大。苏湖山的人说：最重要的是我们的地位最适中，到全区那里都只有一天路，将来办事方便好照顾。结果，政府设立在苏湖山赢得了大多数村寨的同意。全山区十个寨子的人们在山顶上选择了一块较平的地方，开始盖房子，迎接自治区人民政府的诞生。老年的人们日夜赶编着“草排”（盖房子用），每天都有人来到工地上。他们要把这里平出一块又大又平的场子，好让远远近近的姑娘都能来这里庆祝跳舞。他们要盖一所好房子，好让代表们在这里开会。
    各界人民代表会议开始了。因为他们这个地区从来就没有过本民族的名字，自治区叫甚么名称呢？主席团和代表们都在思索着本民族语言中最美好的词汇。有的说：叫“苏脉”（意即大富）吧，我们这里将来会富有。有的说：叫“族达拉咪”（意即有希望）吧，我们谷子长得好的时候，我们就叫“族达拉咪”。最后有人提议叫“格朗和”爱尼族自治区。因为“格朗和”意味着幸福的和有发展的美好的远景。他们说：当我们的孩子安全地生下来的时候，我们高兴地叫“格朗和”，现在毛主席领导我们，使我们得到了幸福，我们将来还要更幸福。
    自治区人民政府的委员和主席都选出来了，爱尼族人民准备迎接自治区人民政府的正式成立。许多寨子的姑娘们赶制着绣花衣裳、挂包和腿套。庆祝成立大会的那天，远近三四十里四十二个寨子的人们都赶来参加，他们敲着古老的铜锣，吹着葫芦笙。广场上到处可以看见包着鲜红头巾、挂着长刀的青年民兵，和满身银饰的姑娘。金珠寨的姑娘们穿着新的绣花衣裳，把许多“沙笼”（送给情郎的花线絮絮）亲手挂在主席的胸前，表示她们对自治区人民政府的热爱。她们和伙伴们围成圈尽情地歌舞起来。她们唱着：
    蝉的声音变了，
    我们从苦的日子里熬过来了。
    太阳照得高高的，
    毛主席的道理来到了，
    我们山上也得幸福了。
