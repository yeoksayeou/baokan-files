    Sixteen Committee Members Manage One Car
    Qiu Fei from the State-owned Qingdao Fourth Cotton Textile Factory writes: The state's large-scale economic construction has begun, and the employees of state-owned enterprises are working selflessly. They are single-mindedly trying to create more wealth for the country in a shorter period of time.
    However, it is a pity that in some of our enterprises, many unnecessary organizations have been established, causing many employees to have multiple concurrent positions, wasting a lot of their time.
    For example, our factory's trade union grassroots committee has only one car, but it is "managed" by an "Automobile Management Committee" composed of sixteen people, including the chairman of the trade union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, and section chiefs. The chairman of the trade union, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, and the section chiefs certainly have heavy workloads, but they also have to take time out of their busy schedules to attend this "committee." Holding meetings during production time, they discuss issues such as "reducing the round-trip fare for each person traveling to Qingdao by car from 4,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan!"
    Our factory also has a "Housing Assessment Committee," which is also composed of committee members from the Party, government, trade union, Communist Youth League, and many active cadres, who spend the whole day in meetings discussing which building someone should live in.
    May I ask, what reason is there not to reduce these extra burdens on employees?

### 十六个委员管理一辆汽车

    十六个委员管理一辆汽车
    国营青岛第四棉纺织厂仇非来信：国家大规模的经济建设开始了，国营企业的职工都在忘我地劳动着。他们一心一意想用更短的时间为国家创造更多的财富。
    但是，可惜得很，在我们的某些企业中，还建立了许多不必要的组织，使许多职工有很多兼职，浪费他们很多时间。
    例如，我们工厂工会基层委员会只有一辆汽车，却由工会主席、团委书记、科长等十六个人组成了一个“汽车管理委员会”来“管理”它。工会主席、团委书记、科长们当然都有着繁重的工作，但也不得不从百忙中抽空来开这个“委员会”。占了生产时间开会，讨论的却是“汽车跑一趟青岛每人来回票价由四千元改为三千元”等问题罢了！
    我们厂还有一个什么“评房委员会”，也是由党、政、工、团及许多在职干部担任委员，经常因某人应住那幢房子而整天地开会讨论。
    试问，有什么理由不可以减轻职工的这些额外的负担呢？
