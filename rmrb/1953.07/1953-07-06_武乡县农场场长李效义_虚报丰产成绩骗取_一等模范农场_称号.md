    Wu Xiang County Farm Director Li Xiaoyi
    Falsely Reported Bumper Harvest Achievements to Deceive and Obtain the Title of "First-Class Model Farm"
    Li Xiaoyi (a Party member), the director of the state-owned farm in Wu Xiang County, Shanxi Province, falsely reported bumper harvest achievements for 1952 in order to deceive and obtain the title of "First-Class Model Farm."
    Last year, the farm had 54.2 mu of autumn land, with a total grain yield of 27,730 jin and 6 liang, averaging 511 jin and 10 liang per mu. Among them, 3 mu of high-yield corn averaged 1,214 jin per mu. However, Director Li Xiaoyi reported to the Shanxi Provincial People's Government that the 54.2 mu of autumn land had a total grain yield of 44,374 jin and 6 liang, averaging 818 jin and 12 liang per mu, falsely reporting an average of 307 jin and 2 liang per mu. The high-yield land was falsely reported by 378 jin per mu. As a result, at the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference last December, it was named the province's "First-Class Model Farm" and received an award from the Provincial People's Government.
    Last autumn, when the joint inspection team of the province and the special district, Wu Xiang group, inspected and evaluated the crops on the farm, they did not conduct a careful investigation, and gave the farm an estimated average yield of 762 jin and 13 liang per mu of autumn land; however, after the actual grain harvest, it was 251 jin and 3 liang less per mu. After the harvest, it was discovered that the actual yield and the estimated yield differed greatly. At that time, promoter Xu Dongtian suggested to Li Xiaoyi that the yield should be corrected, but Li not only did not do so, but also threatened, "Why is there less grain? Did you lose it?" He also openly said to the workers, "When others ask you how much grain was harvested in the farm, just say you don't know." In mid-November last year, Li Xiaoyi privately revised the bumper harvest summary report, adding 192 jin out of thin air to the 3 mu of high-yield corn based on an estimated yield of 1,400 jin per mu; in addition, he added 245 jin per mu to 10 mu of ordinary corn, falsely reporting 3,026 jin for these two items alone. In this way, the Wu Xiang Farm actually received awards from the county and the province.
    The leading comrades of the Wu Xiang County Party Committee and the County People's Government showed a bureaucratic work style on this issue. They did not understand the true situation of the farm, and usually only assigned tasks to the farm without inspection, only looking at the surface without looking at the reality, and long believed that "Li Xiaoyi is a loyal old cadre and would never falsely report bumper harvest achievements." The false reporting of bumper harvest facts was not revealed until February 24th of this year when the Finance Section of the County People's Government inspected the financial system, but the County Party Committee never took a positive attitude to send someone to the farm to conduct an in-depth inspection and seriously deal with it.

### 武乡县农场场长李效义  虚报丰产成绩骗取“一等模范农场”称号

    武乡县农场场长李效义
    虚报丰产成绩骗取“一等模范农场”称号
    山西省武乡县国营农场场长李效义（党员）虚报一九五二年丰产成绩，骗取“一等模范农场”称号。
    去年，该场共有秋地五十四亩二分，总共打粮两万七千七百三十斤六两，每亩平均实产五百一十一斤十两；其中三亩高额丰产玉茭每亩平均实产一千二百一十四斤。但场长李效义却向山西省人民政府呈报为：五十四亩二分秋地，总共打粮四万四千三百七十四斤六两，每亩平均八百一十八斤十二两，每亩平均虚报三百零七斤二两。丰产地每亩虚报三百七十八斤。因此，在去年十二月山西省农业劳动模范大会上，被评为全省“一等模范农场”，并获得了省人民政府的奖励。
    去年秋季，省、专区联合检查团武乡小组检查评比农场的庄稼时，没有经过仔细调查，就给该场每亩秋地平均估产为七百六十二斤十三两；但实际收粮后，每亩要少二百五十一斤三两。收获后，已发现实际产量和估计产量相差很远。当时推广员徐冬田向李效义建议，要求更正产量，李不仅不这样作，反而威胁说：“粮食为啥少打，是你们丢了吗？”他还公开向工人说：“场内打粮多少，别人问你们时，就说不知道。”去年十一月中旬，李效义私自修改了丰产总结报告，将三亩丰产玉茭在每亩估产一千四百斤的基数上凭空加了一百九十二斤；另外又将十亩一般玉茭每亩加了二百四十五斤，仅这两项就虚报了三千零二十六斤。就这样，武乡农场竟然得到了县和省的奖励。
    中共武乡县委会和县人民政府领导同志在这个问题上表现了官僚主义的作风。他们不了解农场的真实情况，平时对农场工作只布置不检查，只看表面不看实际，长期认为“李效义是个忠实的老干部，绝不会做出假报丰产成绩的事来”。假报丰产事实直到今年二月二十四日县人民政府财政科检查财经制度时才被揭露出来，但县委始终没有采取积极态度派专人到农场深入检查，认真进行处理。
