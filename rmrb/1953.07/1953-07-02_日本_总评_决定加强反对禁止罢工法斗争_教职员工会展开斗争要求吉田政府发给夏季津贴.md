Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Tokyo News: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sōhyō) has decided to strengthen the struggle against the anti-strike law with practical actions, including strikes.

On June 29th, Sōhyō convened a meeting of representatives from 16 affiliated unions, including the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union, the All Japan Metal Mine Workers' Union Federation, and the Japan Confederation of Public Employees' Unions, to discuss and decide on specific measures for the struggle. These measures were finalized at the Sōhyō Board of Directors meeting held on June 30th.

According to the decision, each union will hold scheduled strikes of two to seven hours across Japan on July 4th, hold mass protest rallies, and pass resolutions against the anti-strike law. Public school teachers and civil servants, who have been deprived of the right to strike by the Yoshida government, will refuse to work overtime on this day. A nationwide 24-hour strike will be held again on July 15th.

Sōhyō has decided that if the Yoshida government and capitalists arbitrarily dismiss and suppress workers while carrying out the struggle against the anti-strike law, all unions affiliated with Sōhyō will resolutely unite and launch struggles with practical actions.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Tokyo News: The Japan Teachers' Union is protesting the police suppression by the Yoshida government and resolutely fighting for the demand to issue summer allowances.

Since submitting a request to the Ministry of Education of the Yoshida government for the issuance of a summer allowance equivalent to one month's salary, the Japan Teachers' Union has been conducting sit-in protests within the Ministry of Education. On June 25th, the Ministry of Education mobilized the police to beat and remove representatives of the Teachers' Union who were conducting sit-in protests in front of the Minister of Education's office. After the incident, the Japan Teachers' Union lodged a serious protest against the Ministry of Education's violent actions and continued to hold sit-in protests in front of the Minister of Education's office.

Due to the resolute struggle of the Japan Teachers' Union, Minister of Education Shigeto Daikatsu of the Yoshida government was finally forced to meet with representatives of the union on June 27th. However, he unreasonably rejected the union's demands for summer allowances. Therefore, the negotiations between the two sides finally broke down.

After the breakdown of the negotiations, the Japan Teachers' Union immediately convened a meeting of the Central Executive Committee and issued a statement saying that it would strengthen mass activities in the future to achieve victory in the struggle for the issuance of summer allowances.

    日本“总评”决定加强反对禁止罢工法斗争
    教职员工会展开斗争要求吉田政府发给夏季津贴
    【新华社一日讯】东京消息：日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）决定以包括罢工在内的实际行动，加强反对禁止罢工法的斗争。
    六月二十九日，“总评”召集它属下的日本煤矿工会、日本电气产业工会、全日本金属矿山工会联合会、日本官公厅工会协议会等十六个工会的代表举行会议，讨论和决定了进行斗争的具体办法。这项办法已在六月三十日举行的“总评”干事会上加以确定。
    根据决定，各工会将于七月四日在日本全国各地举行两小时到七小时的定时罢工，举行群众抗议大会和通过反对禁止罢工法的决议。被吉田政府剥夺了罢工权利的公教人员将在这天拒绝做逾时工作。七月十五日，全国将再举行一次二十四小时的罢工。
    “总评”决定：在进行反对禁止罢工法的斗争时，如果发生吉田政府和资方任意解雇和镇压工人的事情，“总评”属下各工会将坚决团结一致，以实际的行动展开斗争。
    【新华社一日讯】东京消息：日本教职员工会抗议吉田政府的警察镇压，坚决为要求发给夏季津贴而进行斗争。
    日本教职员工会自从向吉田政府的文部省提出了发给相当于一个月工资的夏季津贴等要求后，曾在文部省内进行静坐斗争。六月二十五日，文部省竟动员了警察把正在进行静坐斗争的教职员工会代表从文部省大臣办公室门前殴打出去。事件发生以后，日本教职员工会对文部省的暴力行为提出了严重的抗议，并接着又在文部省大臣办公室门前坚持静坐斗争。
    由于教职员工会的坚决斗争，吉田政府文相大达茂雄终于被迫在六月二十七日接见工会的代表。但是，他对教职员工会提出的发给夏季津贴等要求，仍然无理地加以拒绝。因此，双方的谈判终于宣告破裂。
    日本教职员工会在谈判破裂以后，立刻召开了中央执行委员会会议，并发表声明说：今后将加强群众活动，以取得要求发给夏季津贴斗争的胜利。
