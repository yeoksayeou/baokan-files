    Counterattack South of Kimhwa
    Jin Zhiguang
    On July 13th, torrential rain fell on the central Korean front.
    A powerful counterattack was being meticulously prepared. On the thirty-plus kilometer long arc-shaped front west of the North Han River, east of Kimhwa, and south of Kimhwa, our army was about to deliver a devastating blow to the Rhee's army, which had been constantly provoking us in recent days. It was on this day that Syngman Rhee also issued a statement to the Associated Press, continuing to clamor that the "goal" of "unifying" Korea "will never change"; and that evening, the loudspeakers on the enemy's positions also repeatedly shouted, "March to the Yalu River!"
    Before the battle started, it rained heavily here. The roads were muddy, and the shell craters and bomb craters were filled with pools of water of all sizes. Teams of soldiers and rows of vehicles marched majestically through the rain and mud, gathering in the war zone. Pools of water blocked the way for the artillery, so the soldiers pushed the artillery forward. Tanks weighing forty to fifty tons had difficulty maneuvering in the mud, so the soldiers laid wooden planks on the road for the tanks to pass over. Infantry transporters, ignoring the rain and mud, carried ammunition and supplies forward on their backs.
    In a tunnel on the Shangganling position, the pre-battle atmosphere was tense and serious. When the soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army received the task of assaulting the Rhee's army's Capital Division's defense line, no one could say how excited and happy they were. At a solemn swearing-in ceremony, the assault team members put forward plans to perform meritorious service in the battle and made heroic vows. After the meeting, the political instructor of a certain company remembered that he still had an apple given to them by a Korean mother in his pocket, so he took out the apple and gave it to his comrades. The assault team members each took a bite, and the love of the Korean people encouraged them to bravely face the battle. They picked up their submachine guns, quietly walked out of the tunnel, and waited silently in the rainy night for the arrival of an important moment.
    Nine o'clock at night—it was time.
    The commander's order flashed like lightning through the telephone lines to each artillery position. A deafening roar was heard, and countless tons of artillery shells immediately poured down on the enemy positions, exploding into a sea of fire, the flames reddening the rainy night sky.
    Our army's fierce artillery fire continued to extend into the enemy's depths, suppressing all of the enemy's fire. Like an iron broom, it cleared the way for the counterattacking troops to charge. At this time, our infantry quickly began their attack. Brave assault team members, under the cover of our army's artillery fire, charged directly towards the enemy positions on Namsan Hill near the Zhuzi Cave.
    The enemy had established a line of resistance almost tens of meters away, each line of resistance equipped with barbed wire, landmines, trenches, and strong bunkers. When the assault team members charged up the hill, they saw that the enemy's chemical mortar group and short-range artillery group had been smashed to pieces by our army's artillery fire; most of the enemy's bunkers and shelters had also been collapsed or shaken down. The enemy's tanks were rolling wildly on the hillside, some were on fire, and some had their tracks blown off. Machine gunner Cao Jialin knocked down a dozen enemies in the charge, but was suddenly hit by a grenade thrown by the enemy, damaging his hand and submachine gun. However, he still used his injured hand to throw two grenades, killing five enemies, and picked up a submachine gun from the enemy's corpse, fiercely sweeping it at the enemy. Demolitionist Li Shuhe continuously blew up the remaining enemy bunkers: one, two, three... When he was blowing up the eighth bunker, his abdomen and legs were wounded. He used all his strength to crawl to the enemy's bunker and stuff a pack of explosives into the enemy's bunker. Unexpectedly, the explosives had not yet detonated when they were pushed out by the enemy with a rifle butt. Li Shuhe immediately fired a burst of submachine gun fire at the gun hole of the bunker, and then re-inserted the explosives. A violent explosion was heard, and the bunker was finally destroyed. But our brave soldier Li Shuhe also gloriously sacrificed himself.
    From the gap that Li Shuhe opened with his body, the assault team members charged up. Then, our army quickly occupied Namsan Hill near the Zhuzi Cave; at this time, another attacking force of our army also occupied Xiangting West Hill. More than twenty attacking arrows of our army that counterattacked the enemy positions on these two hills all sent out signals that they had occupied the positions.
    Another unit of the Volunteer Army, counterattacking the enemy's central position, Jiao Yan Mountain, west of the North Han River, followed the signal flares of various colors rising from the mountains and rushed out of the jungles and weeds, braving the heavy rain and advancing bravely on the slippery hillside.
    This counterattacking force had fought on Jiao Yan Mountain for three days and three nights when it crushed the enemy's so-called "Autumn Offensive" in 1951. Yang Zhenhuai, the company commander of a certain company, and his soldiers had killed and wounded more than a thousand enemies in the battle. This time, they excitedly accepted this glorious task again. Before the battle began, they had repeatedly observed the terrain near Jiao Yan Mountain and the charging routes, and accurately calculated the speed at which the assault team would climb the mountain and attack in the rainy night. At this time, the assault team members quickly rushed up the mountain along this charging route and launched the battle. One soldier, Communist Youth League member Yue Jucai, blew up seven enemy bunkers in a row. Another soldier, Communist Youth League member Xie Zhenyi, after being wounded four times, blew up two more key enemy firing points. A standard-bearer was wounded in the advance, and Communist Party member Zhang Furong immediately took the red flag from his hand and continued to advance. Machine gunner Qian Mingren covered him, and they eliminated four more enemy firing points in a row, finally planting the victorious red flag on the peak of Jiao Yan Mountain.
    The brave assault team members opened the way for this counterattacking force. They broke through the enemy's lines of resistance one after another, climbed over steep mountain rocks without roads, and occupied Jiao Yan Mountain completely after a night of fierce fighting. In this way, in a little over one night, the area of more than 100 square kilometers that the enemy had exchanged for tens of thousands of casualties in the autumn of 1951 was all recovered by our army; and six full battalions and most of two other battalions of the Rhee's army were also wiped out at the foot of this mountain.
    The enemy on all sides retreated in a panic. At a certain place, the commander, standing in more than a foot of accumulated water, immediately issued an order to pursue the enemy in victory. Our army, braving the heavy rain, followed the footprints left by the enemy in the mud as they retreated in a hurry, and pursued them fiercely to the south.
    From the west side of Namsan Hill near the Zhuzi Cave, an assault team of our army swiftly and rapidly inserted itself behind the enemy and occupied the commanding height of 424.2, the high ground on the enemy's retreat route. When the enemy retreated into this gully, a burst of gunfire suddenly rang out, blocking the enemy's retreat route. Behind them, our army's frontal attacking force also followed closely. In this way, attacked from both sides, the more than 2,600 survivors of the 26th Regiment of the Rhee's army's Capital Division were completely annihilated in this gully of less than one square kilometer.
    The enemy, who had been shouting "Northward March," was now "retreating southward" in great strides. How panicked and embarrassed they retreated. Look! On the road of our army's pursuit, enemy tanks, artillery vehicles, jeeps, trucks, bullets and clothing were scattered everywhere... The enemy's vehicles could not escape, trapped in the mud like turtles. Some enemies could not escape and sat on the muddy road waiting to surrender. The Syngman Rhee gang's "Taegeukgi" flag and its worthless counterfeit currency were trampled in the mud.
    Under our army's torrential artillery fire and lightning-like attacks, the enemy was completely terrified. Near Ludong, in order to save their own lives, the enemy abandoned even a fighter plane and twenty-nine trucks loaded with ammunition and supplies. The enemy had originally placed explosives on a large bridge on the Jincheon River, intending to destroy this vital transportation route with the push of a button in case our army arrived. But before the enemy could act, our rapid pursuit force rushed across the bridge and wiped out the enemy.
    Standing on the main peak of Jiao Yan Mountain, 760 meters high, one could see our army's infantry, artillery, and vehicles carrying grain and ammunition, braving the heavy rain, continuously crossing the Jincheon River and advancing south, pursuing the enemy who were retreating in panic. One could see our victorious red flag flying in the wind on the mountain peak. Traces of destruction left by the enemy were everywhere on Jiao Yan Mountain: the enemy's bunkers were destroyed by our army's powerful artillery fire and could no longer be seen, and the enemy's corpses, wearing "nylon bulletproof vests," lay scattered in the dilapidated trenches and the hillside full of shell craters.
    In just one day and night, the counterattacking forces of our army broke through the enemy's heavily fortified positions along the entire line. By the 18th, our army had expanded its position area by 192.2 square kilometers and eliminated 26,089 enemies. More than three divisions of the Rhee's army, including the 3rd Division, the 6th Division, and the 8th Division, were defeated by our army, and the elite Capital Division of the Rhee's army was also shattered by our army. The enemy's important positions, Jiao Yan Mountain, Yuefeng Mountain, Feng Volcano, and dozens of other large and small mountain ranges have once again become our army's steel positions. No matter how Syngman Rhee and his generals believe in "going it alone," clamoring arrogantly for a "Northward March," and driving their remnants to launch counterattacks time and time again, they will never be able to step into our army's new defense line again.

    金城以南的反击战
    金之光
    七月十三日，朝鲜中线大雨倾盆。
    一个强大的反击战正在严密布置着。在北汉江以西、金化以东、金城以南的三十多公里长的弓形战线上，我军将要对连日来不断挑衅的李伪军进行毁灭性的打击。正是这一天，李承晚还向合众社记者发表声明，继续叫嚣“统一”朝鲜的“目标决不会改变”；而这天傍晚，敌军阵地上的广播器也不时传出“打到鸭绿江去”的叫喊声。
    战斗发起之前，这里就下了大雨。公路上一片泥泞，炮弹坑和炸弹坑积成了大大小小的水潭。一队队的战士们，一列列的车辆，冒着大雨，踏着泥浆，从公路上威武地走过，向战区集结。水潭阻住了炮车前进的道路，战士们就推着炮车前进。四五十吨重的坦克在泥泞中不好行驶，战士们就把木棍垫在路上让坦克通过。徒步的运输员也不顾头上的雨水，脚下的泥泞，背着弹药物资前进。
    在上甘岭阵地上的一条坑道里，战斗前的空气紧张而严肃。志愿军某部的战士们，在接受突击李伪军首都师防线的任务的时候，谁也无法说出是怎样地兴奋和愉快。在庄严的宣誓大会上，突击队员们纷纷提出在战斗中立功的计划，发出了英雄的誓言。会后，某连政治指导员想到自己的口袋里还保存着一位朝鲜母亲送给他们的苹果，于是他就把苹果掏出来，送给他的战友们。突击队员们每人吃了一口，朝鲜人民对他们的热爱鼓舞着他们勇敢地去迎接战斗。他们提起冲锋枪，悄悄地走出坑道，在雨夜里肃静地等待着一个重要时刻的来临。
    夜晚九点钟——是时候了。
    指挥员的命令像一阵闪电，经过通往各个炮兵阵地的电话线传出去，只听得一阵惊天动地的巨响，无数吨炮弹立刻倾泻到敌军阵地上，爆炸成一片火海，火光映红了雨夜的天空。
    我军猛烈的炮火继续向敌人的纵深延伸，把敌人的炮火全部压下去了，就像一把铁扫帚一样，给反击部队扫清了冲锋道路上的障碍。这时候，我们的步兵迅速地开始了进攻。勇敢的突击队员们，在我军炮火的掩护下，一直向注字洞南山上的敌军阵地冲去。
    敌人差不多在相距几十公尺远的地方，就设了一道抵抗线，每一道抵抗线都设了铁丝网、地雷、战壕和坚固的地堡。当突击队员们冲到山上以后，他们看到敌人的化学迫击炮群和短距离炮群已被我军炮火打得稀烂；敌人的地堡和掩蔽部也大部分被打塌了和震塌了。敌人的坦克被打得在山坡上乱滚，有的着起了大火，有的被炸断了履带。机枪手曹家林在冲锋中打倒了十几个敌人以后，突然被敌人扔过来的一颗手榴弹炸坏他的手和机枪，但是他仍用那只受了伤的手扔出两颗手榴弹，炸死了五个敌人，并且捡起敌人尸体上的冲锋枪，向敌人猛烈扫射。爆破手李树和连续爆破着残存的敌人的地堡：一个、两个、三个……当他爆破第八个地堡的时候，他的腹部和两腿都负伤了。他就用尽力量爬到敌人地堡的跟前，把一包炸药塞进敌人的地堡里，不料炸药还没爆炸，就被敌人用枪托推出来了。李树和马上又用冲锋枪朝着地堡的枪眼猛烈扫射了一阵，接着重新把炸药塞了进去，只听得一声巨烈的爆炸声，这座地堡终于被炸毁了。而我们的勇敢的战士李树和，也光荣地牺牲了。
    从李树和用他的身体打开的缺口里，突击队员们冲了上去。接着，我军迅速地占领了注字洞南山；就在这时候，我军另一支攻击部队也占领了香亭西山。反击这两座山上敌军阵地的我军的二十多个攻击箭头，都发出了占领阵地的讯号。
    另一路反击北汉江以西敌人的中心阵地轿岩山的志愿军某部战士们，随着从群山中腾起的五光十色的讯号弹，从丛林乱草中冲出来，冒着大雨，在溜滑的山坡上奋勇前进。
    这支反击部队在一九五一年粉碎敌人的所谓“秋季攻势”时，曾经在轿岩山上进行了三天三夜的战斗，某连连长杨振怀和他的战士们，在战斗中曾经打死打伤一千多名敌人。这次他们又兴奋地接受了这个光荣的任务。在战斗开始之前，他们已经反复地观察了轿岩山附近的地形和冲锋道路，并且精确地计算出突击队在雨夜里爬山攻击的前进速度。这时候，突击队员们就沿着这条冲锋道路迅速地冲到山上展开了战斗。一个战士、青年团员岳巨才一连炸毁了敌人的七个地堡。另一个战士、青年团员谢振义在四次负伤后，又炸毁了敌人的两个主要火力点。一位旗手在前进中负伤了，共产党员张富荣马上又从他手中拿过红旗，继续前进。机枪手钱明仁掩护着他，他们一连又消灭了敌人四个火力点，终于把胜利的红旗插到了轿岩山的高峰。
    勇敢的冲锋队员们为这支反击部队打开了前进的道路，他们突破了一道道的敌人的抵抗线，爬过没有道路的陡峭的山岩，经过一夜的激战，全部占领了轿岩山。这样，在一夜多的时间里，一九五一年秋天敌人用几万人的伤亡换去的一百多平方公里的地区，又被我军全部收复了；而且六个整营和两个营大部分的李伪军，也被消灭在这座大山下了。
    各路敌人狼狈地溃退着。在某处，站在一尺多深的积水中的指挥员立刻下达乘胜追击敌人的命令。我军冒着大雨，踏着敌人仓皇溃退时留在泥泞中的脚印向南猛追。
    从注字洞南山西边，我军的一支突击队神速地猛插到敌人背后，占领了敌人退路上的制高点四二四点二高地。当敌人退到这个山洼里的时候，猛然响起一阵枪声，截住了敌人的退路，后面，我军的正面攻击部队也紧跟着追了上来。就这样，前后夹击，把李伪军首都师第二十六团残存的二千六百多人，全部歼灭在这个不到一平方公里的山洼里了。
    高喊“北进”的敌人现在是大踏步地“南退”了，他们退得多么仓皇和狼狈。看吧！在我军追击前进的道路上，到处散满了敌人的坦克、炮车、吉普车、卡车、子弹和衣物……敌人的车辆逃不掉了，就像乌龟一样陷在淤泥里。有些敌人逃不掉了，就坐在泥泞的公路上等着缴枪投降。李承晚匪帮的“太极旗”和它的不值钱的伪币一起，被践踏在污泥里。
    在我军暴雨似的炮火，闪电似的攻击下，敌人完全被吓昏了。在芦洞里附近，敌人为了自己逃命，连一架战斗机和二十九辆满载弹药物资的卡车都丢掉了。在金城川的一座大桥上敌人本来已经安放了炸药，他们打算万一我军到来，一按电钮，就可以把这个交通要道毁灭掉了。可是敌人还没有来得及动作，我神速的追击部队就冲过了这座大桥，消灭了敌人。
    站在七百六十公尺高的轿岩山的主峰上，可以看到我军的步兵、大炮、载运粮弹的汽车，冒着大雨源源不绝地渡过金城川，向南挺进，追击狼狈溃退的敌人。可以看到我们的胜利的红旗在山峰上迎风飘扬着。轿岩山上到处留下敌人毁灭的痕迹：敌人的地堡被我军的强大炮火打得连影子也看不见了，穿着“尼龙避弹衣”的敌人的尸体，横躺竖卧地满布在残破的战壕和弹坑累累的山坡上。
    仅仅一昼夜的时间，我军各路反击部队就全线突破了敌人坚固设防的阵地。到十八日止，我军扩展了阵地面积一百九十二点二平方公里，消灭了两万六千零八十九名敌人。李伪军的第三师、第六师、第八师等三个多师被我军击溃了，李伪军的精锐首都师也被我军打得七零八落。敌人的重要阵地轿岩山、月烽山、烽火山等大小几十个山岭又变成了我军的钢铁阵地。不管李承晚和他的将军们怎样迷信着“单独干”，狂妄叫嚣着“北进”，驱使他们的残兵败将一次又一次地进行反扑，可是他们再也无法踏进我军的新防线一步了。
