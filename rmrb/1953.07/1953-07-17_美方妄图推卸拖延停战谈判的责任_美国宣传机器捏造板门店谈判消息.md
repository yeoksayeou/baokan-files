Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 17th: Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The American propaganda machine is now under orders to fabricate news about the Panmunjom negotiations, attempting to shift the responsibility for delaying the armistice talks onto the Korean-Chinese side.

    According to our side's July 16th communique, the Korean-Chinese side suggested a one-day recess on the 16th, with negotiations to resume at 2:00 PM on the 18th. However, on the 17th, United Press reporters in Tokyo, with ulterior motives, fabricated a rumor that all indications showed that it was Harrison who requested the one-day recess on the 16th, in order to "demonstrate to the communists that the Allied forces had made the utmost efforts to ensure that South Korea and other UN forces abide by the terms of the armistice agreement." This is obviously a deliberate attempt by United Press to cover up the US side's responsibility for delaying the negotiations. Our side's July 15th communique published the fact that Harrison unreasonably withdrew from the meeting, thus exposing the US side's attempt to repeat their past tricks to delay the negotiations, which was clearly unfavorable to the US side. In order to cover this up, United Press was ordered to spread rumors and further fabricate news of the meeting, saying that Harrison had put forward some suggestions and some ultimatums at the meeting. In fact, the communique has already stated that the suggestion to adjourn the meeting on the 16th at Panmunjom until the 18th was proposed by our side, and Harrison should have agreed to it. As for the so-called ultimatum, anyone with a little common sense knows that because the Syngman Rhee group is undermining the agreement and obstructing the negotiations, the US side can only propose the responsibility of guaranteeing the armistice, and cannot in turn make any ultimatum to the Korean-Chinese side. Is the US side preparing to break off negotiations?

    It is completely reasonable for the Korean-Chinese side to demand that Harrison provide practical guarantees that Syngman Rhee will abide by the armistice agreement. World opinion mostly sympathizes with this request from the Korean-Chinese side. The US propaganda machine is racking its brains, attempting to use these absurd propaganda to divert the universal demands of peace-loving people around the world for the US to guarantee the armistice, but it is impossible for them to achieve their goals.

### 美方妄图推卸拖延停战谈判的责任  美国宣传机器捏造板门店谈判消息

    美方妄图推卸拖延停战谈判的责任
    美国宣传机器捏造板门店谈判消息
    【新华社开城十七日电】    本社特派记者江南报道：美国的宣传机器现在正在奉命捏造板门店谈判的消息，企图将拖延停战谈判的责任推在朝中方面身上。
    根据我方十六日公报，朝中方面在十六日建议休会一天，谈判到十八日下午二时继续举行。但是合众社记者十七日却别有用心地从东京造谣说，一切迹象都表明十六日是哈利逊要求休会一天的。为的是“以便向共方表明，联军方面在保证南朝鲜和联合国其他部队遵守停战协定条款方面已尽了最大的努力。”这显然是合众社故意想要替美方掩饰拖延谈判的责任。我方十五日公报发表了哈利逊无理退出会场的事实，因而揭穿了美方企图重复他们过去的故技来拖延谈判的妄想，这显然对于美方是不利的。为了对此进行掩饰，合众社才奉命造谣、而且还进一步捏造会议消息，说什么哈利逊在会场上提出了什么建议、什么最后通牒。实际上，公报已说明十六日板门店会场上休会到十八日的建议是我方提出的，这应该是哈利逊同意了的。至于所谓最后通牒，稍有常识的人都知道，由于李承晚集团破坏协议，阻挠了谈判，美方只有提出保证停战的责任，而说不上反来向朝中方面提什么最后通牒。难道美方准备破裂谈判么？
    朝中方面要求哈利逊就李承晚遵守停战协定提出切实保证，这是完全合理的。世界舆论多同情朝中方面这个要求。美方宣传机关挖空心思，企图拿这些荒谬宣传来转移世界爱好和平人民对美方要求停战保证的普遍要求，是不可能达到它们的目的的。
