On the Yunnan Frontier

Here is the Yunnan frontier of the motherland.

In that sun-obscuring primeval forest, on that desolate mountain where no human footprint can be found, sounds that have been foreign to the frontier for generations echo: the hissing of logging, the clanging of hammering stones, the rumbling of explosions, interspersed from time to time with cheerful labor songs. These sounds break through the unique and eternal silence of the frontier, foretelling that the frontier will move towards happiness and prosperity. Listen, this is the song coming from the depths of the forest: "You cut one stroke, I cut one stroke, and the big tree is about to fall, let's work together to build the frontier well." Listen, this is the song echoing in the valley: "Frontier warriors are men of iron, not afraid of shoulder pain and aching bones, crossing mountains and rivers to carry wood, to turn the frontier into paradise."

Building the frontier is arduous and difficult. But, what does this count for compared to the hardships and difficulties during the bandit suppression period on the frontier? In the past three years, in order to eliminate the bandits and secret agents fostered by imperialism, in order to let the brotherly ethnic groups live in peace, how much hardship have the frontier warriors experienced, how many difficulties have they overcome! Sometimes wading through torrents that are chest-deep, sometimes drilling into old forests where the sun can't be seen, sometimes climbing cliffs that pierce the clouds, sometimes descending into deep gullies like wells. Sometimes in the pouring rain, sometimes in the sand and dust filled winds, sometimes chasing the remaining bandits under the scorching sun. Not sleeping for two or three nights, not eating for two or three days, clothes soaked with rain and sweat, then dried on the body, shoes worn out, they went barefoot to pounce on the bandit dens. How many heroic deeds have emerged! Wei Sicheng led a squad to pursue the routed bandit Diao Mingliang, and on the afternoon of the third day, they encountered him near a cliff. Wei Sicheng rushed up like a flying arrow. Seeing the fierce momentum, the bandit Diao rolled down the cliff in an attempt to escape. Wei Sicheng fired two shots without hitting him, and then jumped down. When the soldiers circled to the bottom of the cliff from the side, they saw the squad leader lying unconscious on top of the bandit Diao, who had been crushed to death by him. Once, in order to eliminate more than thirty bandits who were stubbornly resisting in a bunker, the soldier Yin Jiachong accepted the blasting mission. When he passed through the sixty-meter open fire zone, his left arm and waist were hit. He fainted due to excessive blood loss, but a strong sense of responsibility brought him back to consciousness. He gritted his teeth, picked up the explosives and rushed up. When he had dug the hole and buried the explosives, he had exhausted all his strength and could no longer leave the danger zone. He did not hesitate to light the fuse. With a loud bang, most of the bunker was blown away, and he also heroically sacrificed his life.

How much blood of comrades has flowed on this frontier land! How many brothers have dedicated their youthful lives for a peaceful today on this land. This is why the frontier warriors are filled with deep love for this land, and feel particularly happy about the current peaceful labor. This is also the basis for the bold words that the frontier warriors now like to say: "Any difficulty must bow its head before the People's Liberation Army."

Indeed, the new difficulties encountered in construction are also bowing their heads one by one before the frontier warriors. Without houses in the deep mountains and old forests, they sleep on the damp ground; if sickles are not enough, they use their hands instead; if there are no baskets for carrying soil, they cut bamboo to weave their own; if ropes are lacking, they climb to the cliffs to cut vines as substitutes... When the soldier Wang Xiuzhen was carrying stones, he slipped and fell off the cliff, and the stones smashed onto his leg, the blood staining his trouser leg red. The medical orderly bandaged him and asked him to go down to rest, but he acted as if nothing had happened, picked up the stones, and limped along, saying, "The volunteers on the front line do not leave the front line with minor injuries, can I stop working and rest with this little injury?" The soldier Hu Ke, wearing only a pair of shorts, fished for wood in the chest-deep cold torrent, his skin wrinkled, his lips frozen purple. He insisted for four hours, until he could no longer support himself, he came ashore to drink a few sips of wine, warmed himself up, and immediately jumped back down to continue fishing for wood. The famous Guo Chunsheng Hero Platoon of a certain unit initially had three people operating one mold, and could only make 170 bricks a day. Later, they humbly learned from the civilian workers, painstakingly studied, and soon one person could master one mold, and could now make 740 bricks a day. The Ding Wenhua blasting team learned how to choose the terrain for blasting, how to strike the turning hammer, and how to set the explosives in three days. Half a month later, each pound of explosives could blast more than six cubic feet of stone, exceeding the upper-level requirement of four cubic feet per pound of explosives. Before long, the soldiers of the past became carpenters, stonemasons, and bricklayers. After the machine gun shooter Zhang Wentian, after the superiors put forward the slogan of "improving work efficiency and accelerating construction," he began to design and manufacture a brick-making machine. He pondered hard all day long, sometimes unable to eat or sleep, his face thinned, and his eye sockets became a little sunken. The company commander saw this situation, encouraged him on the one hand, and on the other hand said to him with concern, "Take your time, don't rush, don't ruin your health." He said, "Please rest assured, chief, if the brick-making machine can be created successfully, I will be happy even if I work hard." Finally, he succeeded, a brick-making machine was made, one brick blank was produced in one second, and three thousand six hundred bricks could be produced in one hour, which increased the efficiency by dozens of times compared to manual labor.

Look! The face of the frontier is beginning to change: on the slopes, rows of house frames are being erected; in the deep mountains and desolate valleys, in places where no one has ever been, roads several feet wide have appeared; on the construction sites, piles of crushed stones like mountains, piles of wood, rows of bricks and tiles, and dazzling lime like snow mountains have been piled up; on the slopes that originally only grew weeds and wildflowers, spinach, cabbage are growing, tomatoes have already fruited, and bean pods have begun to form clusters. On the roads leading to the interior, public transportation teams and groups of caravans come and go, and the sound of livestock bells never ceases all day long. Salt, cloth, and agricultural tools are transported from the interior. Pineapples and bananas produced on the frontier are also transported to the interior.

The lives of the people of all ethnic groups on the frontier are improving day by day, and they sincerely thank Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in China. Gao Da, a Baiyi ethnic group member, said: "Chairman Mao is the savior, Chairman Mao's army eliminated the moths for us, and they are building roads and producing here, you are really good, Chairman Mao's kindness is higher than the mountain!"

The initial change in the face of the frontier is encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the soldiers.

Listen! This is the voice full of the soldiers' ideals: "We want to build the frontier of the motherland as well as Siberia in the Soviet Union!"

    在云南边疆上
    续思
    这里是祖国的云南边疆。
    在那遮天蔽日的原始森林里，在那渺无人烟的荒山上，响起了边疆世世代代以来陌生的声音：嘶嘶地伐木声，当当的敲击石头声，隆隆的爆炸声，不时地还夹着愉快的劳动的歌声。这声音，冲破了边疆那种特有的永恒的寂静，预告着边疆将要走向幸福和繁荣。你听，这是从森林深处传出来的歌声：“你一刀，我一刀，眼看大树就砍倒，咱们合力来劳动，要把边疆建设好。”你听，这是回荡在河谷中的歌声：“边疆战士铁打的汉，不怕肩痛筋骨酸，翻山过河扛木料，要把边疆变乐园。”
    建设边疆是艰苦的、困难的。可是，比起边疆剿匪时期的艰苦和困难又算得什么呢？三年来，边疆战士们为了消灭帝国主义豢养的土匪和特务，为了让兄弟民族在和平中生活，他们经历了多少艰苦，克服了多少困难啊！有时涉过齐胸深的激流，有时钻进不见天的老林，有时攀上插入云霄的悬岩，有时又下到水井似的深沟。有时在瓢浇的骤雨中，有时在飞沙走石的狂风中，有时在火热的阳光下穷追残匪。两三夜不睡觉，两三天不吃饭，衣服被雨水汗水浸湿了，又在身上烘干，鞋子磨掉了，就打赤脚向匪巢扑去。出现了多少英雄事迹啊！魏思成带着一个班追击溃匪刁明亮，追到第三天下午，在一个悬岩附近碰到了，魏思成飞也似地扑了上去，刁匪见来势甚猛，就滚下山崖，企图逃跑，魏思成打了两枪未中，随即纵身跃下。当战士们从侧面绕到崖下时，看见班长人事不醒地压在刁匪身上，刁匪被他砸死了。一次，为了消灭在碉堡里顽抗的三十多个土匪，战士尹家冲接受了爆破任务，当他通过六十公尺开阔地的封锁线时，左膀和腰部都挂彩了，一时流血过多，昏了过去，可是一种强烈的责任感又使他清醒过来，他又咬紧牙关，抱起炸药冲了上去，当他掏好洞子，埋好炸药时，浑身力气已经使尽，再也不能离开危险区域，他就毫不犹豫地拉响了导火索，轰的一声巨响，碉堡被炸飞了大半边，他也壮烈牺牲了。
    多少同志的血流在这块边疆的土地上！多少弟兄为了这块土地有一个宁静的今天而献出自己青春的生命。这就是边疆战士对这块土地充满了深厚的爱，对现在的和平劳动感到格外愉快的原因。这也就是边疆战士们现在喜欢说的那句豪语：“什么困难也得在解放军面前低头”的根据。
    的确，建设中碰到的新的困难，也在边疆战士面前一一低头了。在深山老林里没有房子，他们就睡在潮湿的地上；镰刀不够用，就用手来代替；挑土没有筐子，就砍竹子自己编；绳子缺乏，就攀到悬崖上砍藤条当代用品……。战士王袖珍背石头时，失脚滑到崖下，石头随着砸在他的腿上，鲜血染红了裤管，卫生员给他包扎好要他下去休息，他若无其事一样，背起石头，一边跛着走，一边说道：“志愿军在前线轻伤不下火线，我这点伤就能停工休息？”战士胡可，只穿一条短裤在齐胸深的寒冷的激流中打捞木料，皮肤起皱了，嘴唇冻紫了，一直坚持了四个钟头，直到实在支持不住了，他才上岸来喝了几口酒，暖了暖身子，马上又跳了下去，继续打捞起木料来。某部著名的郭春声英雄排，起初三个人掌握一个模子，每天只能打一百七十块，以后他们虚心向民工学习，苦心钻研，很快
    一个人就能掌握一个模子，每天已能打七百四十块了。丁文华爆炸小组三天就学会了选择爆炸地势，打翻身锤，下炸药，半个月以后，每斤炸药就能炸开六立方以上的石头，超过了上级规定的每斤炸药炸四立方的要求。没有多久，过去的士兵就变成了木匠、石匠和泥水匠了。机枪射手张闻天，当上级提出“提高工作效率、加速建设”的口号以后，他就开始设计制造一部造砖机，他成天苦思着，有时饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好，脸也瘦了，眼窝也有点陷下去了，连长看到他这种情形，一方面鼓励他，
    一方面又对他关切地说：“慢慢来，别急，不要把身体搞垮了。”他说：“请首长放心，如果造砖机能创造成功，我辛苦点心里也高兴。”最后，他终于成功了，一部造砖机制成了，一秒钟出一块砖坯，
    一点钟就能出三千六百块，比手工劳动提高了几十倍的效率。
    看吧！边疆的面貌在开始改变了：在山坡上，竖立起了一排排的房子架；在深山荒谷中在从来没有人迹的地方，出现了几尺宽的大道；在工地上堆起了像山一样的碎石，堆起了一叠叠的木料，一行行的砖瓦和像雪山一样耀眼的石灰；在原来只生着杂草和开着野花的山坡上长起了菠菜、白菜，蕃茄已经结果，豆荚也开始成串了。在通向内地的大道上，公营的运输队和成群的马帮，来来往往，牲口的铃铛声终日不绝。食盐、布匹，农具从内地运来了。边疆生产的菠萝、香蕉也向内地运去了。
    边疆各族人民的生活一天天地得到改善了，他们衷心地感激中国各民族的伟大领袖毛主席。摆夷族高大爹说：“毛主席是救星，毛主席的军队给我们消灭了蟊贼，又在这里筑路、生产，你们实在好啰，毛主席的恩情比山还高哩！”
    边疆面貌的初步改变正在鼓舞着战士的劳动热情。
    听吧！这充满战士们的理想的声音：“我们要把祖国的边疆，建设得和苏联的西伯利亚一样！”（附图片）
