The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on working people to further strengthen their unity in the struggle for peace. The World Federation of Trade Unions stated: "The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement vividly proves that the people can achieve victory in the struggle for peace. The working people of all countries express their respect to the Korean people who bravely resisted the American aggressors and suffered terrible hardships in order to defend world peace; express their respect to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers who have forever consolidated the unbreakable unity and friendship between the Korean and Chinese people."

The appeal to working people worldwide states that the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the Korean armistice is a great victory for the people, a victory that may open up new paths to victory for the people's camp fighting for peace on a world scale. "The will of working men and women of all countries, the will of all peace fighters, has proven to be more powerful than the aggressive intentions of American monopoly capitalists and Syngman Rhee."

The World Federation of Trade Unions then reminds the American and world working people that they "must remain vigilant and strive for the victory of the spirit of consultation in resolving all outstanding international issues."

The appeal to working people worldwide concludes by emphasizing that the vigilance of the working people and their confidence that the forces of peace worldwide will achieve final and complete victory will further help to strengthen and consolidate the unity of the peace and democracy camp.
