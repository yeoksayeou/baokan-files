Qingdao City Shibei District Universal Suffrage Work Team Relies on Local Organizational Strength to Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work

The Qingdao Municipal Election Committee's Shibei District Universal Suffrage Key Pilot Work Team, after conducting population surveys, voter registration, and publishing voter lists in seven electoral districts of Liaoning Road and Jiaozhou Road in Shibei District, left a portion of cadres to continue working, while most of the cadres went to the other thirty-six electoral districts in the district in early June to conduct universal suffrage pilot work. Currently, the propaganda work in these thirty-six electoral districts has largely concluded and is about to enter the population survey and voter registration stage.

When the universal suffrage work team conducted the pilot universal suffrage work in Liaoning Road and Jiaozhou Road, it neglected to utilize the strength of local organizations. At that time, the cadres of the work team believed: "To carry out universal suffrage work in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, it is not appropriate for the street cadres to come forward," and "There are many cadres in the work team, and we can rely on our own strength." Therefore, they did not rely on local organizations and developed a tendency towards "working alone." When they dispersed to the other thirty-six electoral districts to work, the cadre strength became very weak (each electoral district had only one guiding cadre and six or seven cadres doing technical work). Although the guiding cadres of the work team raised the issue of relying on local organizations to mobilize the masses when arranging work, they did not explain specific methods or criticize the cadres' erroneous thinking. Therefore, they still adopted the "working alone" method, which caused the entire work to fall into a state of chaos and passivity. The heads of each electoral district work group were busy lecturing the masses all day, sweating profusely; general cadres were also busy organizing meetings, but the work results were minimal. This "fighting alone" method of the work groups in each electoral district also aroused dissatisfaction among local cadres.

In order to change this situation, the responsible cadres of the work team, at the meeting of the work captains of each guiding area (the work team was divided into four guiding areas, with one guiding area responsible for guiding the work of about ten electoral district work groups) and the heads of each electoral district work group, specifically emphasized the issue of utilizing local organizations and giving play to the strength of local cadres. At the same time, they criticized the saying that "it is not appropriate for street cadres to come forward," and pointed out that carrying out universal suffrage work in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy only means purging individual bad elements and those who have committed serious mistakes and aroused public anger from the political organs. For those cadres who have committed general shortcomings and mistakes, the policy of criticism and education should be adhered to, and they should be helped to correct them. At the meeting, the captains of each guiding area and the heads of each electoral district group examined their own thinking and work style. After the meeting, most of the captains of the guiding areas and the heads of the electoral districts conveyed the message to their units, and all the cadres also studied a passage in the People's Daily editorial "Create and Promote the Experience of Conducting Elections in Combination with Production" regarding working methods. Many electoral districts convened meetings of local organizations (including residents' committees, street women's representative meetings, youth federations, and Party and League members), the work group reviewed its working methods, solicited the opinions of street cadres, and told the street cadres about the intention of conducting universal suffrage work, and explained the content and methods of propaganda. Some electoral district work groups also formulated work plans together with street cadres.

After the working methods were changed, a new situation emerged in the universal suffrage work. The cadre strength of the work group in the Fourth Electoral District was originally very weak. One person had to manage three or four residents' groups, and was extremely busy all day long, and the effect of propaganda work was also minimal. However, now more than a dozen cadres with lecturing ability and prestige among the masses have been selected from the residents' committee. The work group first imparted the content of the propaganda, and then adopted the "contracting" method, with them taking charge of one residents' group each, and conducting propaganda to the masses through reading newspapers, individual visits, casual talks, etc., which has been very effective. More than 90% of the adults in each electoral district have been educated. Because the street cadres have brought their work enthusiasm into play, they have also created good working methods in their work. For example, in the preparation work for voter registration in the Tenth Electoral District, Cai Xuwu, a member of the residents' committee, and other street cadres came up with the idea of using waste paper to pre-fill voter registration forms: that is, to help the masses pre-fill their names, ages, and other items on waste paper through reading groups or residents' groups, so that they can go to the registration station to register immediately after the voter registration station is set up, so as to ensure the rapid progress of the registration work.

The State-Owned Tianjin People's Printing Factory Conducts Universal Suffrage Propaganda in Combination with Production

The State-Owned Tianjin People's Printing Factory is conducting universal suffrage propaganda closely in combination with production. More than fifty groups in the factory have put forward various conditions to ensure that they will greet the universal suffrage with practical actions.

When the People's Printing Factory began universal suffrage propaganda, the entire factory was launching a red flag subject competition. The factory leaders first convened an expanded cadre meeting at the workshop level, and put forward the mobilization slogan of "Welcome the universal suffrage, deeply launch the red flag subject competition, and strive to complete or over-fulfill the 1953 production task." All workshops held meetings to make specific studies, and some workshops also convened union group leader meetings to widely discuss the issue of combining universal suffrage with production.

Before the universal suffrage propaganda began, cadres went deep into the workshops, used the time after workers got off work or other free time, mobilized the Party's propagandists and various union propaganda forces, and used reports, big-character posters, radio stations, Q&A, express reports, and Taiping lyrics to carry out extensive propaganda. In the propaganda, they generally paid attention to not affecting production and workers' rest time. The propagandists of the offset printing workshop used the free time after workers got off work to conduct brief and popular propaganda. Some propagandists used casual talks to propagandize to the workers on their way home from work. Some propagandists adapted the content of the universal suffrage into quick clappers and Taiping lyrics, and sang to the workers during rest time. The Cai Jianlian group of the cutting section of the binding workshop also asked elderly workers to describe the fact that workers had no democratic rights before liberation, explaining the preciousness of democratic rights, which greatly educated everyone.

After propaganda, the workers have successively put forward to greet the universal suffrage with practical actions. Each production group has put forward guarantee conditions for the key issues or weak links in the production of the group. For example, the Cai Jianlian group of the cutting section of the binding workshop used to have serious rework phenomena and low attendance rate. After group discussion, the young worker Mu Ruilin proposed: To ensure the elimination of errors, and to propagandize the universal suffrage to his family and neighbors. The elderly worker Mu Wenbin guaranteed to teach his skills to the young workers. All the workers in the group also guaranteed that the attendance rate would reach more than 98%. The Napu Yong group of the utility workshop did not complete the task in the past five months, so they found out the main reasons for not completing the task, and put forward a guarantee to complete the plan to welcome the universal suffrage. Some groups have poor product quality, and in the guarantee conditions, they focus on guaranteeing to improve product quality.

At present, many groups in the factory have set off a wave of enthusiasm for welcoming the universal suffrage, and some groups have realized the guarantee conditions. The Cai Jianlian group has overfulfilled the administrative targets, and the attendance rate has reached 100%. After the workers of the Zhang Jinrong group in the offset printing workshop studied, they adjusted the labor organization and improved the operation methods, and finally completed the production task two days ahead of schedule.

Shenyang Chemical Plant Conducts Pilot Universal Suffrage Work in Combination with Production

In the pilot universal suffrage work conducted by the Shenyang Municipal Universal Suffrage Work Team in the Shenyang Chemical Plant, the production enthusiasm of the workers was brought into play, and the labor productivity was improved.

The universal suffrage work team dispatched by the Shenyang Municipal Election Committee started pilot universal suffrage work in the Shenyang Chemical Plant on June 7. They are mostly cadres who are familiar with industrial production and the situation of workers. The captain and group leaders were transferred from the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other units. This group of forces worked well with the factory's original cadres who had undergone universal suffrage study. They went deep into the workshops to understand the problems existing in production, and also conducted investigations and studies on the ideological state of the workers. Then, they carried out work according to the actual situation in the factory. The staff who went to the 514 workshop found that the reasons why the workshop had failed to complete the production plan for five consecutive months in the past were poor labor protection work and lax labor discipline of a few workers; at the same time, they also found that some workers did not have a clear understanding of the significance of universal suffrage. The work group then preliminarily improved the labor conditions on the administrative side of the factory; on the other hand, they used examples of the changes in the lives of workers and the development of industrial production in recent years to publicize the superiority of the people's democratic regime and inspire workers to further establish a sense of responsibility as masters of the country. In this way, the production enthusiasm of the workers was generally improved, and in less than a week, the daily output of the entire workshop increased by more than 30%. As of June 20, the workshop had completed 67.5% of the monthly production plan.

Under the slogan of "Welcoming Universal Suffrage with Practical Actions," the workers of the entire factory enthusiastically launched a labor competition. The labor productivity of many workshops and groups has increased. Since the pilot universal suffrage work was carried out under the principle of facilitating production as much as possible, the pilot universal suffrage work has also progressed very smoothly. As of June 22, the investigation of the permanent resident population and voter registration in the factory have been completed. (Xinhua News Agency)

Preparations for Universal Suffrage in Minority Areas of Central South China

Preparations for universal suffrage are underway in the minority areas of Central South China, and some areas have begun key pilot projects for grassroots elections. The Hunan Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region People's Government and the five counties under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Hainan Li-Miao Autonomous Region have successively established election committees. The chairmen of the election committees of the four Miao people-inhabited counties of Fenghuang and Yongshui in Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region are all outstanding sons and daughters of the Miao people. The Autonomous Region People's Government has transferred cadres and plans to conduct key pilot projects in different areas such as the Miao and Han people-inhabited and mixed areas in the region. The preliminary determination of key pilot counties in minority areas of Guangxi Province includes the Da Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous Region, the Da Yao Mountain Yao Autonomous Region, and certain townships under Pingyue County. Work teams have arrived in each county to begin work.

The Hainan Li-Miao Autonomous Region, which started work earlier, trained more than 200 grassroots cadres in March and April, and conducted pilot grassroots elections in Baoding and Sanping townships in Ledong County. The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China South China Branch and the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government also sent a work team to the Autonomous Region to assist in the work.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    青岛市市北区普选工作队依靠当地组织力量开展普选工作
    青岛市选举委员会市北区普选重点试办工作队，在市北区辽宁路和胶州路的七个选区进行了人口调查、选民登记并公布了选民名单以后，除留下一部分干部继续进行工作外，大部分干部于六月初旬分赴该区其他三十六个选区进行普选试办工作。目前，这三十六个选区的宣传工作已大体结束，即将进入人口调查、选民登记工作阶段。
    普选工作队在辽宁路和胶州路进行普选试办工作时，曾经忽视运用当地组织的力量。当时，工作队的干部认为：“要结合反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争进行普选工作，让街道干部出头露面不合适”，“工作队的干部多，光靠自己的力量就可以了”，因而没有依靠当地组织，产生了“单干”的倾向。当他们分散到其他的三十六个选区进行工作以后，干部力量就十分薄弱了（每一个选区只有一个指导干部，六、七个做技术工作的干部）。虽然工作队的指导干部布置工作时，曾提出依靠当地组织发动群众这个问题，但没有交代具体办法，也未能批判干部的错误思想，因此他们还是采用了“单干”的方法，致使整个工作陷于忙乱、被动状态。各选区工作组组长整天忙着给群众讲课，累的满头大汗；一般干部也忙着组织开会，但工作成绩很小。各选区工作组的这种“孤军奋斗”的工作方法，也引起了当地干部的不满。为了改变这种状况，工作队的负责干部在各指导区（按工作队下设四个指导区，一个指导区负责指导十个左右选区的工作组工作）工作队长及各选区工作组长的会议上，专门强调了运用当地组织和发挥当地干部力量的问题，同时批判了“街道干部出头露面不合适”的说法；指出结合反官僚主义斗争进行普选工作，只是把个别的坏分子及犯有严重错误而又引起群众公愤的分子从政权机构中清洗出去，对于那些犯有一般性缺点和错误的干部，应当坚持批评教育的方针，帮助他们改正。会上，各指导区队长和各选区组长都检查了自己的思想和工作作风。会后，大部分指导区的队长和选区的组长都向本单位干部进行了传达，全体干部也学习了人民日报社论“创造和推广结合生产进行选举的经验”中关于工作方法的一段。不少的选区召开了当地各组织（包括居民委员会、街道妇女代表会、青联及党、团员）会议，工作组检讨了自己的工作方法，征求了街道干部的意见，并把进行普选工作的意图告诉街道干部，交代了宣传内容和宣传方法。有的选区工作组并和街道干部一起制订了工作计划。
    工作方法改变之后，普选工作出现了新的局面。第四选区原来工作组干部力量十分薄弱。一个人要掌握三、四个居民组，整天忙得要命，宣传工作的效果也很小。但是，现在从居民委员会中挑选了十几名有讲解能力、在群众中有威信的干部，先由工作组传授宣传内容，然后采取“包干”方法，由他们分头掌握一个居民组，通过读报、个别访问、闲谈等方式，向群众进行宣传，收效很大。各选区受到教育的成年人都在百分之九十以上。由于街道干部发挥了工作积极性，在工作中也创造了良好的工作方法。如第十选区在进行选民登记的准备工作中，居民委员会委员财叙五就和其他街道干部想出利用废纸预填选民登记表的办法：即事先通过读报组或居民组，帮助群众预先把自己的姓名、年龄等项填在废纸上，等选民登记站设立后，就可以马上到登记站登记，这样可以保证登记工作的迅速进行。（叶予）
    国营天津人民印刷厂结合生产开展普选宣传
    国营天津人民印刷厂紧密结合生产开展普选宣传，全厂已有五十多个小组提出了各种条件，保证以实际行动迎接普选。
    人民印刷厂开始普选宣传时，全厂正发动红旗课题竞赛。工厂领导方面首先召开了车间一级扩大干部会议，提出了“迎接普选，深入展开红旗课题竞赛，为完成或超额完成一九五三年生产任务而奋斗”的动员口号。各车间都开会作了具体研究，有的车间还召开了工会小组长会议，广泛讨论了普选结合生产的问题。
    在普选宣传开始前，干部们深入到车间去，利用工人下班后或其他空隙时间，动员党的宣传员以及工会的各种宣传力量，采用报告、大字报、广播站、问答、快报、太平歌词等方式，展开广泛宣传。在宣传中，一般都注意不影响生产和工人的休息时间。胶印车间的宣传员利用工人下班后的空隙时间，进行简短、通俗的宣传。有的宣传员在下班的路上，用闲谈方式向工人宣传。有的宣传员把普选内容编成快板、太平歌词，在休息时间向工人演唱。装订车间裁切工段贾恩练小组，还请老年工人述说解放前工人毫无民主权利的事实，说明民主权利的可贵，对大家教育很大。
    经过宣传后，职工们纷纷提出要以实际行动来迎接普选。各个生产小组都针对本组生产中的关键问题或薄弱环节，提出保证条件。如装订车间裁切工段贾恩练小组，过去返工现象严重，出勤率低。经过小组讨论，青年工人穆瑞林提出：保证消灭错误，并向自己家属和邻居宣传普选。老年工人穆文彬保证把自己的技术教给青年工人。全组工人并保证出勤率达到百分之九十八以上。工务车间那普涌小组过去五个月没完成任务，他们就找出没完成任务的主要原因，提出完成计划迎接普选的保证。有些小组产品质量不好，在保证条件中就着重提出保证提高产品质量。
    目前该厂许多小组已掀起迎接普选的热潮，有些小组已实现了保证条件。贾恩练小组已超额完成了行政指标，出勤率达到百分之百。胶印车间张金荣小组经过全组工人研究，调整了劳动组织，改进了作业方法，终于提前两天完成生产任务。

    沈阳化工厂结合生产试办普选
    沈阳市普选工作队在沈阳化工厂进行普选典型试办工作中，发挥了工人们生产积极性，提高了劳动生产率。
    沈阳市选举委员会派出的普选工作队从六月七日起在沈阳化工厂开始试办普选工作，他们大都是熟悉工业生产和工人情况的干部。其中的队长和组长都是从沈阳市总工会等单位抽调去的。这批力量和经过普选学习的工厂原有干部在工作中配合得很好，他们分别深入到车间，了解生产中存在的问题，并对工人的思想状况作了调查研究。然后，根据工厂中的实际情况进行工作。到该厂五一四车间去的工作人员，找出了该车间以往连续五个月未完成生产计划的原因是劳动保护工作不好和少数工人劳动纪律松弛；同时也发现了有的工人对普选的意义还认识不清楚。工作组便一方面建议工厂行政上初步改善了劳动条件；一方面用几年来工人生活变化和工业生产发展的实例，宣传了人民民主政权的优越性，启发工人进一步树立国家主人翁的责任感。这样，工人生产积极性普遍提高，在不到一周的时间中，全车间的日产量就提高了百分之三十以上。截至六月二十日止，这个车间已完成全月生产计划百分之六十七点五。
    全厂工人在“以实际行动迎接普选”的口号下，热烈展开劳动竞赛。许多车间、小组的劳动生产率都有上升。由于在尽量便利生产的原则下试办普选，因此普选试办工作也进展得很顺利，到六月二十二日止，已完成了厂内常住人口调查和选民登记等工作。（新华社）
    中南少数民族地区进行普选准备工作
    中南区少数民族地区正在进行普选的准备工作，有些地区已经开始基层选举的重点试办。湖南省湘西苗族自治区人民政府，和广东省海南黎族苗族自治区所辖五个县，都已先后成立了选举委员会。湘西苗族自治区凤凰、永绥等四个苗族人民聚居县的选举委员会主席，都是苗族人民的优秀子弟。自治区人民政府已抽调干部，计划在全区苗、汉族聚居和杂居等不同地区，作重点试办。广西省初步确定少数民族地区的重点试验县有大苗山苗族自治区、大瑶山瑶族自治区和平乐县所属的某些乡，工作队已分别到达各县开始工作。
    进行工作较早的海南黎族苗族自治区，在三、四月间即训练了基层干部二百多人，并在乐东县的保定、三平两乡进行基层选举试办工作。中共中央华南分局统一战线工作部和广东省人民政府民族事务委员会，还派出一个工作队到自治区协助工作。
