Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 5th (TASS): The German News Agency published a letter from Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, to all farmers of the Republic.

In the letter, Grotewohl reminded the farmers that if the fascist riots were to succeed, the democratic fruits such as the land, machines, and land reform of tractor stations given to them would inevitably be deprived; they would inevitably be destroyed and once again subjected to the oppression of the Prussian nobles.

Grotewohl pointed out that the purpose of launching riots was to ignite the flames of war in Germany. He wrote: Honest people do not want war, and farmers especially do not want war. The government of the German Democratic Republic has consistently strived to avoid this terrible danger. Therefore, regardless of all war provocations, it has consistently implemented its policy of reunifying Germany and ensuring peace. All obstacles hindering the achievement of this goal must be swept away. Therefore, on the advice of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the government has reviewed the path it has taken, decided to correct the mistakes it has made, and proposed measures that will rapidly improve the people's living conditions and promote mutual understanding among the German people.

Grotewohl then explained in detail the decisions of the government of the German Democratic Republic, which are aimed at strengthening and further developing farms and agricultural production cooperatives. In this regard, he spoke of the government's decision to provide farmers with short-term and long-term loans, and special loans to farmers who temporarily leave the fields, as well as the government's decision to reduce the quota of public grain to be paid by farmers in 1953.

The Premier said that the government will guarantee to resolve all the problems raised in the spirit of the principles stipulated by the government on June 11, 1953—strict respect for the legitimate rights of owners and increased production of consumer goods.

Grotewohl pointed out that all the measures proposed by the government to improve the living conditions of farmers will enable them to develop their farming and further enhance their welfare.

Grotewohl also emphasized that the government will continue to help agricultural production cooperatives by providing loans, supplying machines, agricultural tools, and other means of production. At the same time, he called on all members of agricultural production cooperatives to consolidate the organization of their cooperatives, improve their work, and thereby enhance the welfare of all cooperative members.

He asked the members of agricultural production cooperatives and all farmers to vigorously prepare for the harvest, and he called on them to make full use of machine tractor stations.

    格罗提渥发表告民主德国农民书
    说明政府将保证改善农民生活情况并进一步增进他们的福利
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社柏林五日讯：德意志通讯社发表了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥告共和国全体农民书。
    格罗提渥在信中提醒农民说，假如法西斯的骚动成功的话，像给予他们的土地、机器，拖拉机站的土地改革这样的民主果实就必然被剥夺；他们必然被毁灭并重新遭受到普鲁士贵族的压迫。
    格罗提渥指出发动骚乱的目的是要在德国燃起战火，他写道：正直的人都不要战争，农民尤其不要战争。德意志民主共和国政府一贯为避免这种可怕的危险而努力，因此，它不顾一切战争挑衅，始终如一地执行它的重新统一德国，确保和平的政策。妨碍达到这一目的的一切障碍都要被扫除。因此，根据德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局的建议，政府检查了已走过的道路，决定改正已犯的错误，并提出一定会迅速改善人民的生活情况，促进德国人民之间相互了解的措施。
    格罗提渥然后详尽地解释了德意志民主共和国政府的决定，这些决定的目的在于加强并进一步发展农场和农业生产合作社。在这方面，他谈到政府给农民以短期、长期贷款，给那些暂时离开田地的农民以特别贷款的决定，以及政府的降低一九五三年农民缴纳公粮定额的决定。
    总理说，政府将保证以一九五三年六月十一日政府所规定的原则——严格尊重业主的合法权利，增加消费品生产——的精神来解决所引起的一切问题。
    格罗提渥指出，政府所提出的改善农民生活情况的一切措施，将使他们都能发展他们的耕作并进一步增进他们的福利。
    格罗提渥并着重指出，政府将以贷款，供应机器、农业工具和其它生产工具的办法来继续帮助农业生产合作社。他同时号召农业生产合作社的所有社员巩固他们的合作社的组织，改进工作，从而增进所有合作社社员的福利。
    他要求农业生产合作社的社员和所有农民大力准备收割，他号召他们充分利用机器拖拉机站。
