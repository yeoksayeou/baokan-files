    Purge Imperialist Elements Hidden Within the Catholic Church

    In recent years, cases of imperialism using Catholicism for counter-revolutionary activities have been uncovered in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Nanjing, and other places. In March and June of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau successively uncovered two cases of imperialist espionage and sabotage. The principal culprits in the two cases, Zhai Guanghua (American), Fei Youwen (American), Ge Shouping (French), and Tian Wanglin (Belgian), were all reactionary priests, chairmen, or seminary presidents in the Catholic Church. Under the instructions of imperialist intelligence agencies, they used Catholicism as a cover to drive a small number of backward Catholics to spy on China's political, economic, and cultural secrets, sabotage land reform and various patriotic movements, and attempt to endanger the people's democratic power. However, in the face of the power of the liberated Chinese people, these imperialist espionage and sabotage schemes were finally exposed. This is another powerful blow to the insidious plans of imperialism, especially American imperialism, to use Catholicism to carry out sabotage activities in China, and another major victory for the Chinese people and patriotic Catholics in their struggle against imperialism.

    These two cases once again fully demonstrate that since the Chinese people have the ability to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang bandit gang, they also have the ability to smash all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism that endanger the safety of the Chinese people. No matter how despicable, insidious, and ferocious these imperialist bandits are, they cannot escape the giant palms of the Chinese people and our people's public security organs. At the same time, the cracking of these two cases also shows once again that imperialism not only used Catholicism and other methods to carry out sabotage activities against China before and in the early days of liberation, but that they are now stepping up their death throes. Chairman Mao had already instructed us in his opening address at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will still struggle to the end. After the country is completely settled, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore [their power] in China every day and every hour." The Chinese people and all patriotic Catholics should learn from the many cases that have been solved, heighten their vigilance against the destructive conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs, and actively assist the People's Government in eliminating all counter-revolutionary espionage activities.

    Imperialist elements hidden within the Catholic Church often spread statements such as "Catholicism is apolitical and has nothing to do with imperialism" to cover up their destructive activities that use religion to oppose the Chinese people. However, countless facts have proved that imperialism's use of Catholicism to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities in China is consistent and planned. In these short few years, people's public security organs in various parts of China have successively uncovered the Catholic espionage cases in Xingtai, Qiqihar, Xianxian, and Shenyang, the case of the American Catholic Bishop Ford in Meixian, Guangdong, engaging in espionage activities, the case of the American Catholic Jesuit priest Mu Yucai and others engaging in counter-revolutionary activities in Nanjing, the case of the American Catholic priest Su Liang engaging in counter-revolutionary activities in Huangshi, the case of the American Catholic priest Weng Mingde colluding with bandits and hiding drugs in Chenxi, the case of the American Catholic priest Gao Erfei engaging in counter-revolutionary activities in Yuanling, the case of the American Catholic believer Qi Ligen engaging in espionage activities in Yulin, Guangxi, the case of the French Catholic Bishop Wen Guibin engaging in counter-revolutionary activities in Tianjin, and the case of the Italian priest Ma Di Nuo engaging in espionage activities in Beijing, etc. This group of imperialist elements, although wearing the cloak of bishops and priests, are actually veteran spies and secret agents. They have long colluded with reactionary elements at home and abroad to undermine China's people's revolutionary cause. After the nationwide liberation, in addition to continuing to collect intelligence for imperialist intelligence agencies, they also maliciously spread many rumors that undermined world peace and incited world war, and prevented and sabotaged Catholics from participating in patriotic movements such as resisting America and aiding Korea. They tried their best to defend the American imperialists' inhumane bacteriological warfare, and some even prepared to carry out armed riots,妄想[妄想 is not precisely "attempting," its meaning is more in the sense of "妄," foolish, vain, absurdly] attempting to subvert our people's democratic power. In these solved cases, the case of the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" published in today's newspaper more systematically exposes the ferocious face of imperialism as an enemy of the Chinese people. The "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps" was a reactionary armed special agent organization under the direct control of the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agent organs, based on reactionary priests in the Catholic Church, and coercing a part of the backward Catholics. Since 1946, this reactionary special agent organization, in addition to spreading rumors and sabotaging, spying on intelligence, and organizing reactionary armed intrusions into the liberated areas in various parts of North China, had also directed the Kuomintang bandit army's planes to indicate bombing targets, killing many innocent people, and sent special agents and bandits to plot to assassinate people's revolutionary leaders. This series of irrefutable facts fully proves that imperialism, especially American imperialism, has consistently used Catholicism to carry out counter-revolutionary espionage and sabotage activities. Their claims that Catholicism is "apolitical" and "has nothing to do with imperialism" are merely smokescreens to cover up their crimes.

    For more than three years since the nationwide liberation, under the leadership and education of the People's Government and with the active assistance of people from all walks of life, especially the successive cracking of espionage cases under the guise of Catholicism, the broad masses of Catholics have further recognized the ugly faces of the imperialists, and they have automatically launched an anti-imperialist patriotic movement. The sole purpose of this movement is to expel imperialist elements from the church, eliminate the influence of imperialism in religious undertakings, and turn Catholicism into a religious undertaking run by the Chinese people themselves. Therefore, it is entirely a patriotic movement of Catholics to safeguard the independence and dignity of the motherland and protect the interests of the Chinese people. However, imperialist elements who are still lurking in the Catholic Church deliberately create rumors in an attempt to sabotage this patriotic movement. Their shameless lies have been seen through by Catholics in many places. Patriotic Catholics have firmly stood up, exposed the various crimes of imperialism in using Catholicism to invade our country, and driven a group of wolves in sheep's clothing out of the church. At the same time, they have also actively participated in patriotic movements such as resisting America and aiding Korea, and some have even bravely reported the espionage activities of imperialist elements, enabling the people's public security organs to quickly solve cases. These patriotic actions all show that the political consciousness of the broad masses of Catholics has been raised, and they have therefore gained the sympathy and support of people from all walks of life. However, it should be emphasized that because there are still a group of imperialist elements occupying the clerical positions of the Catholic Church, they often use means such as "depriving of divine power," "suspending sacred functions," "expelling from the church," and "not giving Holy Communion" to intimidate Catholics and clergy who show a little patriotic expression; therefore, the patriotic spirit within the Catholic Church has not been fully promoted, and some Catholics are still apprehensive and dare not stand up and fight against the imperialist elements. What is even more serious is that a very small number of Catholics have been deceived by imperialist propaganda for a long time, have been deeply poisoned, and still cannot see through the mask of imperialist elements using religion to carry out sabotage activities, and under the inducement and threat, have participated in espionage activities and committed crimes that endanger the interests of the motherland and the people. This shows that clearing imperialist elements from the Catholic Church is of great significance for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and ensuring the country's economic construction; it is also a powerful support for the patriotic movement of Catholics. In this anti-imperialist struggle, a small number of Catholics who have gone astray should quickly repent, resolutely break off relations with imperialist elements, and stand on the side of anti-imperialism and patriotism.

    The People's Government has always resolutely protected freedom of religious belief and legitimate, open religious activities. The Common Program has clear provisions on this policy of freedom of religious belief. Chairman Mao had already clearly pointed out in "On Coalition Government": "As long as believers abide by the laws of the People's Government, the People's Government will protect them. Believers and non-believers each have their own freedom, and no coercion or discrimination is allowed." When receiving the Tibet Tribute Delegation last year, Chairman Mao once again stated: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, and believers and non-believers, believers of this religion or believers of other religions, are all protected and their beliefs are respected. The policy of protecting religion is adopted today, and the policy of protecting religion will still be adopted in the future." (See the broadcast speech of Liu Xia Tudeng Tabar, head of the Tibet Tribute Delegation, to the monks and lay officials of the Tibetan local government and all Tibetan monks and lay compatriots, published in this newspaper on November 22, 1952.) In order to implement Chairman Mao's instructions and implement the policy of freedom of religious belief, the People's Government has taken many effective measures in recent years. All patriotic believers who abide by the policies and laws of the People's Government, no matter what religion they believe in, their freedom of belief is universally protected, and their customs are respected. Even for a very small number of believers who have gone astray, the People's Government adopts a policy of patient education; as long as they can repent, their religious beliefs are also protected. The People's Government's consistent attitude in word and deed has won the support of the broad masses of believers. These irrefutable facts can never be distorted by any rumors and slanders of imperialism. However, it must be solemnly pointed out that the People's Government only protects legitimate and open religious activities, and those who use religion as a cover to secretly engage in counter-revolutionary espionage and sabotage activities must be resolutely suppressed. This is also the consistent policy of the People's Government. The People's Government will never tolerate the counter-revolutionary activities of imperialism and its running dogs in the name of protecting freedom of religious belief, and the People's Government will never interfere with freedom of religious belief in order to eliminate imperialist elements and their running dogs from the Catholic Church. Therefore, all devout Catholics, in order to safeguard the interests of the motherland and the people, and also to prevent their religious beliefs from being tainted, must strictly distinguish between legitimate religious activities and counter-revolutionary activities carried out in the name of religion, and resolutely eliminate imperialist elements and counter-revolutionary elements hidden within the Catholic Church. This is a patriotic act that every Catholic should have, and it is also a legitimate act of loving the church.

    Opposing the conspiracies and sabotage of imperialism is a long-term struggle. Although the imperialists have suffered repeated defeats, they will inevitably continue to use all means to disrupt and sabotage our country. People from all walks of life in our country and patriotic Catholics should heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, prevent complacency from arising from certain victories that have been achieved, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, be prepared at all times to smash all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism.

### 肃清潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子

    肃清潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子
    近年来在北京、天津、沈阳、南京等地陆续破获了帝国主义利用天主教进行反革命活动的案件。今年三月和六月，上海市人民政府公安局又先后破获了两起帝国主义间谍破坏案件。两案中的主犯翟光华（美籍）、斐有文（美籍）、格寿平（法籍）和田望霖（比利时籍）等，都是天主教中的反动神甫、会长或神学院长。他们在帝国主义特务机关的指使下，以天主教为掩护，驱使少数落后的天主教徒，刺探我国的政治、经济和文教机密，破坏土地改革和各种爱国运动，企图危害人民民主政权。但在解放了的中国人民力量面前，这些帝国主义的间谍破坏阴谋终于被揭穿了。这对于帝国主义特别是美帝国主义利用天主教在我国进行破坏活动的阴险计划是又一个有力的打击，这是我国人民和爱国的天主教徒反对帝国主义斗争的又一重大胜利。
    这两个案件再一次充分地说明，我国人民既然有能力推翻帝国主义及其走狗国民党匪帮在中国的反动统治，也就有能力粉碎帝国主义危害我国人民安全的一切阴谋诡计。不论这些帝国主义匪徒是多么卑鄙、阴险和凶恶，都无法逃出我国人民群众及我人民公安机关的巨掌。同时，这两个案件的破获也再次说明，帝国主义不仅在我国解放以前和解放初期，利用天主教和其他方式对我国进行破坏活动，而且他们现在正加紧作垂死的挣扎。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词中早就指示过我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”我国人民和一切爱国的天主教徒，都应该从已经破获的许多案件中吸取教训，提高对帝国主义及其走狗的破坏阴谋的警惕，积极协助人民政府，肃清一切反革命的间谍特务活动。
    潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子，往往散布“天主教是超政治的、与帝国主义没有关系的”等等说法，来掩饰他们利用宗教进行与我国人民为敌的破坏活动。但是无数事实都证明，帝国主义利用天主教在我国进行反革命破坏活动是一贯的和有计划的。在这短短的几年间，我国各地人民公安机关曾先后破获了邢台、齐齐哈尔、献县和沈阳的天主教间谍案，广东梅县天主教美籍主教福尔德间谍活动案，南京天主教耶稣会美籍神甫牧育才等反革命活动案，黄石天主教美籍神甫苏良反革命活动案，辰溪天主教美籍神甫翁明德通匪藏毒案，沅陵天主教美籍神甫高尔飞反革命活动案，广西郁林天主教美籍教徒其履根间谍活动案，天津天主教法籍主教文贵宾反革命活动案，北京意籍神甫马迪懦间谍活动案等等。这一批帝国主义分子虽然披着主教、神甫的外衣，实际上都是老牌的间谍特务。他们曾经长期勾结我国内外的反动分子，破坏我国人民革命事业。在全国解放以后，他们除继续为帝国主义特务机关收集情报以外，还恶意地散布了许多破坏世界和平和煽动世界大战的谣言，阻止和破坏天主教徒参加抗美援朝等爱国运动。他们极力为美帝国主义的灭绝人性的细菌战辩护，有的甚至准备进行武装暴乱，妄想颠覆我人民民主政权。在这些已破获的案件中，今天本报发表的“公教青年报国团”的案件，更系统地暴露了帝国主义与我国人民为敌的凶恶面目。“公教青年报国团”是一个以天主教为掩护的反动武装特务组织，是在帝国主义和国民党匪帮特务机关的直接掌握之下，以天主教中的反动神甫为基础，裹胁一部分落后的天主教徒组成的。从一九四六年开始，这个反动的特务组织，除在华北各地造谣破坏、刺探情报、组织反动武装侵扰解放区以外，还曾经为国民党匪军的飞机指示轰炸目标，杀害了许多无辜的人民，并派遣特务匪徒阴谋刺杀人民革命领袖。这一系列无可争辩的事实充分证明：帝国主义尤其是美帝国主义一贯利用天主教，进行反革命的间谍破坏活动，它们说什么天主教“超政治”、“与帝国主义没有关系”，只是掩盖它们罪行的烟幕罢了。
    全国解放三年多以来，在人民政府的领导和教育下，在各界人民的积极协助下，特别是以天主教为掩护的间谍特务案件的陆续破获，已使广大天主教徒进一步认清了帝国主义的丑恶嘴脸，他们自动地开展了反帝爱国的运动。这一运动的唯一目的，是从教会中驱逐帝国主义分子，肃清帝国主义在宗教事业中的影响，使天主教变成中国人民自办的宗教事业。因此，它完全是天主教徒为了维护祖国的独立和尊严，保护我国人民利益的爱国运动。但是仍然潜伏在天主教内的帝国主义分子，却有意制造谣言，企图破坏这一爱国运动。他们的无耻谎言已为许多地方的天主教徒所识破。爱国的天主教徒已经坚定地站起来了，揭发了帝国主义利用天主教侵略我国的种种罪恶，把一批披着羊皮的豺狼赶出了教会。同时，他们也积极地参加了抗美援朝等爱国运动，有的更勇敢地检举了帝国主义分子的间谍特务活动，使人民公安机关能够迅速破案。这些爱国的行动都说明，广大天主教徒的政治觉悟已经提高了，因而获得了各界人民的同情和赞助。但是应该着重指出，由于至今还有一批帝国主义分子窃据着天主教的神职，对于稍有爱国表现的教徒和神职人员，动辄用“摘神权”、“停止神功”、“开除教籍”、“不给领圣体”等手段来威吓；因此，天主教内的爱国正气还没有得到充分的发扬，有些教徒还心存疑惧，不敢起来和帝国主义分子作斗争。更有极少数的天主教徒长期受了帝国主义的欺骗宣传，中毒较深，至今仍然看不清帝国主义分子利用宗教进行破坏活动的假面目，而在利诱和威胁之下，参加了间谍特务活动，犯了危害祖国和人民利益的罪行。这就说明清除天主教内的帝国主义分子，对于巩固人民民主专政和保障国家的经济建设是有着重大意义的；对于天主教徒的爱国运动也是有力的支持。在这一反帝斗争中，少数误入歧途的教徒应该赶快悔悟，毅然决然地和帝国主义分子斩断关系，站到反帝爱国这一方面来。
    人民政府对于宗教信仰和正当的、公开的宗教活动一向是坚决保护的。关于这一宗教信仰自由的政策，共同纲领上已有明文规定。毛主席在“论联合政府”中早已明白指出：“只要教徒们遵守人民政府法律，人民政府就给以保护。信教的和不信教的各有他们的自由，不许加以强迫或歧视。”在去年接见西藏致敬团时，毛主席又一次说明：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰。今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”（见一九五二年十一月二十二日本报所载西藏致敬团团长柳霞·土登塔巴对西藏地方政府僧俗官员和全体藏族僧俗同胞的广播词）人民政府为了执行毛主席的指示，贯彻宗教信仰自由的政策，几年来曾经采取了许多有效的措施。凡是遵守人民政府的政策法令的爱国教徒，不论他们信奉那一种宗教，他们的信仰自由都一概受到保护，他们的风俗习惯都受到尊重。就是对于极少数误入歧途的教徒，人民政府也是采取耐心教育的政策；只要他们能够悔悟，对他们的宗教信仰同样加以保护。人民政府这种言行一致的态度，获得了广大教徒的拥护。这种无可争辩的事实，决不是帝国主义的任何造谣污蔑所能歪曲的。但是必须严正指出：人民政府只保护正当的公开的宗教活动，对于那些以宗教为名而实际上秘密进行反革命间谍破坏活动的分子，则必须坚决加以镇压。这也是人民政府一贯的政策。人民政府决不因为保护宗教信仰自由而容忍帝国主义及其走狗的反革命活动，人民政府也决不因为要清除天主教内的帝国主义分子及其走狗而干涉宗教信仰自由。因此，一切虔诚的天主教徒，为了维护祖国和人民的利益，也为了使自己的宗教信仰不受沾污，必须把正当的宗教活动和利用宗教所进行的反革命活动加以严格的区别，坚决把潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子和反革命分子清除出去。这是每一个天主教徒应有的爱国行为，也是爱教的正当行为。
    反对帝国主义的阴谋破坏是一个长期的斗争。帝国主义者虽已接连遭到了失败，但他们必然要继续利用一切方式对我国进行捣乱和破坏。我国各阶层人民和爱国的天主教徒，都应该百倍提高警惕，防止因已取得的某些胜利而产生麻痹思想，而必须在共产党和人民政府的领导下，随时准备粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计。
