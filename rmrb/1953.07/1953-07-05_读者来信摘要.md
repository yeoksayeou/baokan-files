Reader's Letters Summary
    Improve Work Efficiency and Methods
    Correct Wasteful Use of Cadres

    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting various wasteful phenomena in the use of cadres in some units. Readers pointed out that in the future, in addition to opposing overlapping institutions, bloated staffing, and waste of personnel, all agencies should focus on studying how to improve work efficiency and methods, gradually achieve fixed staffing levels and quotas, and ensure that institutional staffing can be increased or decreased according to the degree of work needs. These opinions are worth taking seriously.

    The Phenomenon of Overstaffing is Very Serious in Various Agencies Under the Huainan Salt Affairs Bureau

    Readers Yang Xincai, Lin Shuhua, Xue Jian, Chen Jie, and others wrote: The Huainan Salt Affairs Bureau is an agency that manages private salt farms, and its working policy is to develop salt fields and abandon stove-based salt production. In recent years, many local salt farmers have abandoned salt production and switched to other occupations. The bureau's production task for 1953 is only equal to 75% of that in 1952, and the institution has gradually shrunk. However, the number of cadres in the bureau has not decreased, resulting in overstaffing and many cadres having nothing to do. Under the so-called "enriching the lower-level institutions" policy of the bureau's leaders, the work of some salt farms has been reduced, but the number of farm directors has increased from one to three, and many cadres have also been transferred in. The production section of the Tainan Salt Farm under the bureau has five statisticians, but in reality, only two are needed. The financial accounting section of the Yanfu Salt Farm has four ticket clerks, but in reality, one is enough. Last year, the Taipei Salt Farm had a cadre specifically in charge of the official seal of the institution. Comrade Zhao Yuhai has been living in the guesthouse since he was assigned to the Yanfu Salt Farm by the Personnel Section of the Huainan Salt Affairs Bureau in September 1952, and was only temporarily drawn to do a few days of prompting work during the New Year's entertainment activities in the farm. Comrade Xin Shaoying, an office worker in the production section of the farm, has not had any work to do for more than a year and spends her time making soles for shoes all day long. Similar situations are numerous. Many comrades have expressed their opinions, but the leading cadres of the bureau have not actively tried to solve this problem. In January of this year, the Huainan Salt Affairs Bureau organized a cadre training class of nearly 80 people, sending many comrades who had nowhere to be assigned to study. Because of frequent transfers in and out, many comrades said: the cadre training class has become a "cadre rotation guesthouse." We sincerely request the bureau to quickly check and correct this phenomenon of wasting cadres and state expenditure.

    Reply Letter from the Huainan Salt Affairs Bureau

    The Huainan Salt Affairs Bureau wrote: The opinion of Comrade Yang Xincai and others that our bureau has a phenomenon of overstaffing is correct. Before 1951, our bureau increased the task of the external inspection agencies and farm areas. At that time, in order to meet the needs of the work, we requested the higher authorities to transfer some cadres and, with the approval of the higher authorities, we held two cadre schools, enrolling nearly two hundred people. However, Huainan is a small salt area with "high cost and poor quality," and the policy is to "develop salt fields and abandon stove-based salt production," and the salt area will be gradually reduced and abandoned. We have not conducted thorough research and in-depth investigation on this development trend, so there was a blind development tendency when increasing cadres. Now that we have checked, the eighty-odd people recruited in the summer of 1951 could have been avoided.

    After the second half of 1951, wild salt stoves were gradually abolished, the external agencies were successively withdrawn, and some salt farmers in the salt area switched to other occupations, and the farm area institutions were also gradually tightened. The phenomenon of overstaffing and waste of cadres has occurred since the second half of 1952. However, because our leading cadres have bureaucratic work styles and departmentalism, they did not deeply understand the situation and actively request the higher authorities to assist in solving this problem in a timely manner. It was not until December 1952, when many cadres were restless due to having nothing to do, that we paid attention to it. On the one hand, we held training classes for centralized study, and on the other hand, we actively reported to the higher authorities, requesting the transfer of some cadres. Fifty people have been transferred out in April of this year, but the current number of cadres still exceeds the establishment, and we are preparing a plan to report to the province requesting the transfer out. Now, in addition to actively dealing with this issue, we are also conducting a deep review in conjunction with the anti-bureaucracy struggle to improve future work.

    Many Cadres in Zhengzhou and Other Materials Management Sub-bureaus in Henan Province Have Had No Work to Do for a Long Time

    Comrade Wang Shizhong of the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government Materials Management Sub-bureau wrote: I think the Zhengzhou Municipal Materials Management Sub-bureau should be immediately abolished. Our bureau was established in December 1950 and received a batch of imported materials at that time; soon after, these materials were transported elsewhere, and our bureau has not received any other materials since then. In October 1951, our bureau was already equipped with ten cadres; but in fact, only four people could bear the entire workload, and these tasks were not frequent. We have repeatedly reported this situation to the higher authorities. However, the reply we received was: "No work is a temporary phenomenon, there will be more work in the future." "If there is no work, can't you study!" Later, because we had no work for a long time, the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government transferred us to engage in the central work of the city. However, the person in charge of the Provincial Materials Administration put forward opinions, and as a result, we were all transferred back.

    In December 1952, the Henan Provincial Materials Administration convened a meeting of the heads of various sub-bureaus and decided to build a warehouse in Zhengzhou. In February of this year, nine cadres were transferred from the Luoyang sub-bureau, and the Provincial Administration also sent a cadre. During this period before the construction of the warehouse, our original cadres and the newly transferred cadres had no work to do. We reported our opinions to the higher authorities, and the reply we received was: "Once the construction starts, you can go to the construction site, and there will be new tasks when the warehouse is built." However, when the foundation was about to be purchased, the Central Materials Administration decided to temporarily not build a warehouse in Zhengzhou. So our hope for work has failed again. What are we twenty-odd cadres currently keeping? A total of only a few thousand catties of firewood and a few thousand catties of scrap steel! It is estimated that these materials can be handled by three cadres in twenty days. Many comrades complain and say: "If there is no work, they will not transfer us elsewhere; why do they keep us piled up here for a long time?"

    Now that the motherland is carrying out the first Five-Year Plan, various construction tasks are very heavy. However, the Henan Provincial Materials Administration allows us cadres to "eat idle meals" here, which I think is an extremely irresponsible attitude towards the motherland. Therefore, I suggest that the higher-level leading organs abolish the Zhengzhou Municipal Materials Management Sub-bureau.

    In addition, according to my understanding: all materials management institutions in Henan Province have the situation of cadres being piled up. For example, the work of materials management institutions in Luoyang, Xuchang, Shangqiu, Xinxiang and other places is not much, but there are many cadres, and many people have to read novels and sleep during the day to pass the time. This waste of manpower should be corrected quickly.

    Reply Letter from the State Materials Reserve Administration

    The State Materials Reserve Administration of the Central Financial and Economic Commission wrote: Your report on Comrade Wang Shizhong's reflection on the long-term lack of work for cadres in the Zhengzhou Materials Management Sub-bureau is, according to our understanding, indeed serious. Not only is the Zhengzhou sub-bureau like this, but the seven sub-bureaus in Henan Province in the past are roughly the same. In order to solve this problem, we decided in May of this year to consult with Comrade Song Shaolin, Director of the Central and South China National Materials Reserve Sub-bureau, to quickly abolish the Henan sub-bureaus and properly handle the subordinate cadres according to the local situation. According to a recent telephone report from Director Song Shaolin: he personally went to Henan at the end of May to handle the matter, the Zhengzhou sub-bureau has been abolished, and the cadres have been handed over to the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government for job assignment.

    Zhumadian Changed from City to Town
    But Unwilling to Reduce the Original Staffing

    Reader Zhang Zhe wrote: Zhumadian Town, Henan Province, is a distribution center for materials in the vicinity of several counties. It was established as a city after liberation, and now it has been changed to a town. In 1952, the National Staffing Committee determined the staffing to be more than 200 people according to the proportion of the city's population of more than 48,000. After the town was changed, the suburbs were划出, and the actual population was only more than 22,000, and administrative affairs were greatly reduced. In principle, the institutions should be tightened. However, the leading organs of the town turned a blind eye to this situation and requested that the original staffing of more than 200 people be retained in 1953. Some responsible persons in the town also believe that the staffing is too large and there is a phenomenon of overstaffing. For example, the Organization Minister of the Zhumadian Town Committee of the Communist Party of China once said that the town "is indeed too big now." For example, the Civil Affairs Section of the town originally had four people, and then two more people were transferred. According to the section chief, "There are too many people in the Civil Affairs Section, and the added people have to be used for flexible deployment."

    I would like to ask: Why are the responsible persons of the town not reducing some staff members according to the actual situation?

    China National Hardware & Electrical Appliances Company Should Not Establish Transportation Organizations in Guangzhou

    Reader Zhou Qicheng wrote: I am a staff member of the Qingdao Branch of China National Hardware & Electrical Appliances Company. In May of this year, our company sent me and two other comrades to Guangzhou to establish a transportation group to handle receiving, distributing, and transporting goods. After arriving in Guangzhou, I found that many branches of China National Hardware & Electrical Appliances Company had sent people here to establish transportation groups. The number of people sent was one or two, and up to five or six, with a total of more than 80 people. Most of the cadres of the transportation groups of various branches are currently living in hotels, with considerable expenses; but in reality, they are idle and have nothing to do. Because the branches of China National Hardware & Electrical Appliances Company and the Guangzhou Supply Station have supply contracts, the goods are packaged and transported by the Guangzhou Supply Station, and all expenses are allocated by the bank. The work of the storage, transportation, accounting, and other personnel of the transportation group can be done by the Guangzhou Supply Station. I think it is unnecessary for the hardware & electrical appliances companies in various places to send people to Guangzhou to establish transportation groups. If they need to maintain regular contact with the Guangzhou Supply Station, they only need to leave one relevant business person in Guangzhou at most.

    Liaoning Provincial Commercial Department Cadre Training Class
    There is Waste in Cadre Training Work

    Reader Wang Huanliang wrote: There is waste in the cadre training work of the Liaoning Provincial Commercial Department Cadre Training Class. In the four months from February to May this year, 24 cadres from the various specialized companies at the Liaoyang municipal level were transferred to the class to learn bookkeeping. However, after these cadres returned to their posts, because the original organs did not need so many bookkeepers, only five people served as bookkeepers, and the rest still served as salespersons. I think that if the organs do not need so many bookkeepers, the Commercial Department Cadre Training Class should not blindly train a large number of people; if the work really needs it, the trained personnel should be uniformly assigned jobs by the Commercial Department, instead of letting them learn what they do not use.

    It is Too Wasteful for Three People to Manage One Telephone

    Su Ren from the Suqian County People's Government of Jiangsu Province wrote: The Suqian County People's Government bought a small single-line telephone last year, but used three special people to manage it. However, the calls to the various districts are still often not connected, and everyone has many opinions. I think: It is indeed too wasteful to use three special people to manage a telephone. If there is something wrong with this machine, it should be thoroughly repaired, otherwise, more people cannot solve the problem of frequent disconnections; if the managers have poor skills and do not know how to use it, they should be sent to big cities to learn the skills of using it. In short, the situation of three people managing one telephone is unreasonable.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    提高工作效率改进工作方法
    纠正使用干部中的浪费现象
    编者按：最近我们收到不少读者来信，反映某些单位在使用干部中的种种浪费现象。读者指出：各机关今后除应该反对机构重叠、编制臃肿、人员浪费的现象外，更重要的，还应该着重研究提高工作效率和改进工作方法，逐步实现定员定量，使机构编制确能根据工作需要的程度而增减。这些意见是值得重视的。
    淮南盐务管理局所属各机关人浮于事的现象十分严重
    读者杨新彩、林树华、薛健、陈杰等来信：淮南盐务管理局是管理民营盐场的机关，工作方针是兴垦废灶。近几年当地盐民废灶转业的很多，该局一九五三年的生产任务只等于一九五二年的百分之七十五，机构亦逐渐缩小。但该局的干部却一直没减少，以致人浮于事，很多干部没有事做。在管理局领导同志的所谓“充实下层机构”的方针下，有些盐场的工作减轻了，但场长却由一个增加为三个，还调进了不少干部。该局所属台南盐场生产股统计员有五人，实际上有两个人就行了。盐阜盐场财务会计股签票员有四人，实际上一个人就够了。台北盐场去年有一个干部专门管机关印鉴。赵玉海同志自一九五二年九月由淮南盐务管理局人事科分配到盐阜盐场后一直住在招待所，只在新年场内搞文娱工作时临时抽去做了几天提台词的工作。该场生产股办事员辛绍英同志一年多没工作做，整天纳鞋底。类似情况还很多。很多同志意见纷纷，该局领导干部并没有积极设法解决这个问题。今年一月，淮南盐务管理局组织了一个近八十人的干部训练班，把很多无处分配工作的同志送去学习。因调进调出的情况频繁，很多同志说：干部训练班已变成“干部轮流招待所”。我们诚恳地要求该局迅速检查并纠正这种浪费干部和国家开支的现象。
    淮南盐务管理局的答复信
    淮南盐务管理局来信：杨新彩等同志反映我局有人浮于事的现象，这个意见是正确的。我局在一九五一年以前因外线检查机构及场区任务加重，当时为了工作需要，向上级要求增调了一些干部，并经上级批准举办两期干部学校，招收了近二百人。但淮南是“本高质差”的小盐区，方针是“兴垦废灶”，盐区将逐渐裁废。我们对这种发展趋势未加缜密研究和深入调查，因此增加干部时有盲目发展的偏向。现在检查起来，一九五一年夏季招收的八十多人是可以不招的。
    一九五一年下半年以后，野灶逐渐废除，外线机构已先后撤销，盐区部分盐民转业废灶，场区机构亦逐渐紧缩。一九五二年下半年后已发生人浮于事，浪费干部的现象。但因为我们领导干部有官僚主义作风和本位主义思想，没有深入了解下情并积极要求上级协助及时解决这个问题，直到一九五二年十二月，不少干部因没事作而情绪不安，才引起我们重视，一方面办训练班集中学习，另一方面积极向上级反映，要求调出一些干部。今年四月已调出了五十人，但目前干部人数还超过编制，正拟订计划报省请求调出。现在我们除积极处理这一问题外，并结合反官僚主义斗争作深刻检查，以改进今后工作。
    河南郑州等物资管理支局很多干部长期没有工作做
    郑州市人民政府物资管理支局王世忠同志来信：我认为郑州市物资管理支局的机构应当立即撤销。我局是一九五○年十二月份成立的，当时接收了一批进口物资；不久这批物资就运往别处，我局就没接收过其他什么物资。一九五一年十月我局已经配备了十个干部；但实际上只要四个人就能负担全部工作，而这些工作也不是经常的。我们多次向上级反映这一情况。可是得到的答复却是：“没工作是暂时的现象，以后工作就多了。”“没工作，学习不也行吗！”后来因为我们长期没有工作，郑州市人民政府就调我们去搞市内的中心工作。但省物资管理局负责人提出意见，结果又把我们都调回来。
    一九五二年十二月，河南省物资管理局召集各支局负责人开会，决定在郑州修建仓库。今年二月，从洛阳支局调来九名干部，省局也派来一个干部。在建仓前的这一段时间里，我们原有的干部和新调来的干部都没有工作可做。我们向上级反映意见，得到的答复是：“开工了，就可上工地去，仓库建成了就有新的任务。”但是，当地基快要买妥的时候，中央物资管理局决定暂时不在郑州建仓。所以我们要求工作的希望又落空了。我们这二十多个干部现在保管着的是什么呢？总共只有木柴几千斤、废钢铁几千斤！这些物资估计有三个干部，用二十天时间就处理完了。很多同志发牢骚说：“没工作也不把我们往别处调；为什么把我们长期积压起来呢？”
    现在祖国正在进行第一个五年建设计划，各种建设任务都很繁重。但是河南省物资管理局却让我们这些干部在这里“吃闲饭”，我认为这是对祖国极不负责任的态度。因此我建议上级领导机关：将郑州市物资管理支局撤销。
    另外，据我了解：河南省所有的物资管理机构都有积压干部的情形。如洛阳、许昌、商邱、新乡等地物资管理机构的工作都不多，而干部却很多，很多人只好在白天看小说、睡大觉，来消磨时间。这种浪费人力的情况都应该迅速纠正。
    国家物资储备总局的答复信
    中央财经委员会国家物资储备总局来信：你报读者王世忠同志反映郑州物资管理支局干部长期无工作可做的问题，据我们了解，确是严重的。不但郑州支局如此，河南省过去共有七个支局，情况大体相同。为了解决这个问题，我们在本年五月间与中南区国家物资储备分局宋绍林局长面商决定，迅速撤销河南各支局，并根据地方情况妥善处理所属干部。近据宋绍林局长电话报告：已于五月底亲到河南处理，郑州支局业已撤销，干部均已交由郑州市人民政府分配工作。
    驻马店由市改镇
    却不愿减缩原有编制
    读者张哲来信：河南省驻马店镇是附近几个县的物资集散地，解放后设市，现已改镇。一九五二年全国编制委员会按该市四万八千余人口的比例，确定编制为二百余人。该地改镇后将郊区划出，实际人口只有二万二千余人，行政事务大大减少，按理应紧缩机构。但该镇领导机关对这一情况置之不理，要求一九五三年仍保留原有二百余人的编制。该镇有些负责人也认为编制太大，有人浮于事的现象。如中共驻马店镇委会组织部长就曾说该镇“现在摊子确实太大”。又如该镇民政科原有四个人，后又调去两个人，据该科科长谈：“民政科人多了，增加的人只好机动使用。”
    我想请问：该镇的负责人为什么不根据实际情况，缩减一部分工作人员呢？
    各地中国五金机械公司不应在广州建立接运机构
    读者周启澄来信：我是中国五金机械公司青岛分公司的工作人员。今年五月间，我公司派我和其他二个同志到广州建立接运组，办理接货、分货、运输工作。到广州后，我发现中国五金机械公司所属的很多分支公司都派人来此建立接运组，派来的人少则一二个，多到五六个，总数已有八十余名。各地分支公司接运组干部目前大部分都住在旅馆里，开支相当大；而实际上却闲着无事可做。因为中国五金机械公司的这些分支公司和广州供应站都订有供应合同，货物由广州供应站代包代运，一切费用由银行划拨。接运组的储运、会计等人员的工作都可由广州供应站来做。我认为，各地五金机械公司无必要派人到广州建立接运组，如果他们需要和广州供应站保持经常的联系，最多也只要在广州留一个有关的业务人员就行了。
    辽东省商业厅干部训练班
    训练干部工作中有浪费现象
    读者王焕良来信：辽东省商业厅干部训练班在训练干部工作中有浪费现象。今年二月到五月的四个月中，辽阳市级各专业公司有二十四个干部被抽调到该班学习记账。但这些干部学习后回到工作岗位，因原机关不需要那么多记账人员，只有五个人担任了记账员，其余的仍然当营业员。我认为，如果各机关不需要那么多记账人员，商业厅干部训练班就不要盲目地大量训练；如果工作确实需要，训练出来的人员就应该由商业厅统一分配工作，而不要让他们学非所用。
    三个人管一部电话机太浪费
    江苏省宿迁县人民政府苏人来信：宿迁县人民政府在去年买了一架小型电话单机，却用了三个专人来管理。但是各区的电话仍是经常叫不通，大家意见很多。我认为：用三个专人管理一部电话机确实太浪费人力了。如果是这部机子有毛病，就应该彻底修理，否则人多也不能解决经常叫不通的问题；如果是管理人技术差、不会使用，则应该派他们到大城市学会使用的技术。总之，三个人管一部电话机的情况是不合理的。
