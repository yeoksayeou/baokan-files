    中朝人民友谊不断增长
    李相朝将军复信勉励四川省青年莫克师等
    【新华社成都二十六日电】中朝人民友谊的不断增长，从两国人民之间的通讯中也可以看出。最近，四川省营山县人民文化馆的青年团员莫克师、何季康、徐超等收到朝中停战谈判代表团李相朝将军给他们的复信。信上述说了朝中人民为了远东和平和世界持久和平、坚持实现朝鲜停战而作的不懈的努力；述说了被遣返的我方病伤人员重回伟大祖国怀抱的情景。信上并指出，当朝中人民保卫世界和平的事业正推向胜利的时候，愿我们更加紧密的团结。最后，信上鼓励中国青年，在新中国的国民经济建设中作出更大的贡献。信中附有一面朝鲜国旗。这面旗子是朝鲜人民军被俘人员李锺国在巨济岛九十二号战俘营里，用洗净了的内衣秘密制成的。李相朝将军把这面朝鲜国旗送给莫克师等作为纪念。
    莫克师等给李相朝将军致敬信是今年“五四”青年节写的。七月一日莫克师等收到李相朝将军的回信后，受到很大的鼓舞，并投书四川日报，表示一定要努力学习，努力工作，和全国青年一道积极参加祖国各项建设，为保卫祖国、保卫远东与世界持久和平而奋斗，来答谢李相朝将军。
