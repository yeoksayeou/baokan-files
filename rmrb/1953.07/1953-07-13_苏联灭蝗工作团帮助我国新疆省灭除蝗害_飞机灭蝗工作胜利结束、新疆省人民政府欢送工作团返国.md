    【新华社西安十日电】新疆省飞机灭蝗工作已胜利结束。新疆省人民政府在六月三十日晚举行欢送会，欢送帮助新疆省各族人民灭除蝗害的苏联灭蝗工作团返国。参加欢送会的有：中共中央新疆分局第三书记张邦英，新疆省人民政府副主席高锦纯、赛福鼎、苏联灭蝗工作团全体人员、苏联驻迪化总领事卡赞斯基和新疆省各机关代表七百多人。欢送会上，新疆省人民政府副主席高锦纯对苏联政府和苏联灭蝗工作团的帮助表示感谢。苏联灭蝗工作团团长尼科莱依秋克讲话中亦指出新疆灭蝗工作的胜利，是中苏友好的胜利。
    新疆省从五月二十二日到六月二十五日的三十多天中，飞机灭蝗面积达六十一万三千多亩。蝗害严重的迪化、干德等六县的农田和草原，经除治后都免除了蝗害。苏联专家和飞行员在灭蝗期间，不顾酷热和自然条件的困难，侦查蝗虫情况，检查灭蝗效果，还随时向当地各民族农民、牧民讲解灭蝗常识，表现了高度的国际主义精神，受到农民、牧民的热爱。
