Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 28th. Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order on July 28th to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, stating: On July 27th, the representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command, on the one hand, and the representatives of the armies of the armed interventionists, on the other hand, signed the armistice agreement. The just fatherland war waged by the Korean people against the imperialist aggressors has ended with our victory. The fact that the armistice agreement was signed proves the military, political, and moral failure of the interventionists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. For three years, with the sincere spiritual and material assistance of the countries of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean people have defended the honor, freedom, and independence of their motherland—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—and achieved victory.

The order continued: Today, with the armistice achieved, the task before our People's Army combatants is to maintain a high degree of vigilance and watch the enemy's conspiracies, and to always be prepared for battle. We should have the confidence that if the interventionists launch another war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, then nothing will save them from final defeat at that time.

I congratulate and thank the comrades for their dedication and heroic struggle in defeating the interventionists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and bringing glorious victory to our people.

On behalf of all the Korean people, I express my warm gratitude to our brave and tenacious brothers, the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who have given us noble assistance in the just fatherland liberation war.

To commemorate the victory over the interventionists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, I order you: at 21:00 today, in our country's temporary capital—Pyongyang—fire twenty-four salvos from one hundred and twenty-four cannons to celebrate.

Long live our glorious motherland—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!
Long live the valiant Chinese People's Volunteer Army!
Eternal glory to the heroes of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who sacrificed themselves in the sacred war for the freedom and independence of our motherland!

    金日成元帅发布命令
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅在七月二十八日向朝鲜人民军全体将士发布命令称：七月二十七日，以朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部的代表为一方，和以武装干涉者的军队代表为另一方，在停战协定上签了字。朝鲜人民为反对帝国主义强占者而进行的正义的祖国战争以我们的胜利而告终。停战协定签字的这个事实，证明了干涉者及其走狗李承晚匪帮在军事、政治与道德上的失败。三年来，朝鲜人民在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国在精神上和物质上的真挚援助之下，保卫了自己的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的荣誉、自由和独立，取得了胜利。
    命令继称：在停战实现的今天，摆在我们人民军战斗员面前的任务是：以高度的警惕性注视敌人的阴谋，要经常作好战斗准备。我们应该怀着这样的信心：如果干涉者们再度发动反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争，那么，在那个时候就不会有任何东西会解救他们免遭最后失败。
    我对战胜了干涉者及其走狗李承晚匪帮并给我们人民带来了光荣胜利的同志们的献身和英雄的斗争，表示祝贺和感谢。
    我以全体朝鲜人民的名义，对在正义的祖国解放战争中给予我们以高贵的援助的勇敢而顽强的我们的兄弟——中国人民志愿军同志们，表示热烈的感谢。
    为了纪念对干涉者及其走狗李承晚匪帮所取得的胜利，我命令你们：今天二十一时，在我们祖国的临时首都——平壤，用一百二十四门炮鸣炮二十四响，以志庆贺。
    我们光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    英雄的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    英勇的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    在为我们祖国的自由和独立的神圣战争中牺牲的朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军英雄们永垂不朽！
