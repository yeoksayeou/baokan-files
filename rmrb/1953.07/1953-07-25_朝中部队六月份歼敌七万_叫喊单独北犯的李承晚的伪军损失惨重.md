(Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 24th) In the sweltering month of June, the Korean and Chinese People's Army, in addition to carrying out 180 attacks and ambushes, launched even more extensive and powerful counterattacks, repelling nearly a thousand enemy counterattacks ranging from a platoon to four battalions. This inflicted heavy losses on the enemy troops on the front lines, particularly on the South Korean forces—the armed forces Syngman Rhee relies on, who are clamoring to strike north to the Yalu River alone.

    The counterattacks by our army in June were carried out on the basis of the initial victory in the summer counteroffensive in May. From mid-May to the end of June, our army's counteroffensive initially took place on both banks of the Bukhan River—in the area where the east and west lines meet. Later, it was carried out in the northwest area of Gorangpo-ri on the right bank of the Imjin River on the western front, and at the beginning of June, it shifted to the area south of Goseong on the east coast. By mid-June, it was again being conducted on both banks of the Bukhan River. Battles followed one after another, and the scale gradually expanded. The enemy troops holding strong positions were unable to withstand our army's powerful attacks.

    The battles on both banks of the Bukhan River were the largest in scale and resulted in the most enemy casualties among the counterattacks in various locations in June. On the night of June 10th, our army, after only 50 minutes of fighting, captured Mount 883.7 and Mount 902.1 near Byeonam-dong on the left bank of the Bukhan River. The majority of the 27th Regiment of the Rhee's puppet 5th Division, which was entrenched on the mountain ridge positions around these two mountains over an area of ten square kilometers, was wiped out, opening the first gap in the enemy's defensive line. Before launching the attack, our army fired extremely heavy artillery fire at this area of hills. The infantry units took advantage of the enemy's confusion to thrust forward and quickly occupied all of the enemy's positions. After our army occupied this position, the Rhee's puppet army hastily dispatched reserves from its 3rd and 5th Divisions into battle, launching more than a hundred counterattacks against us in four days, attempting to regain their lost positions. However, our army not only defeated all of the enemy's counterattacks but also launched two larger counterattacks, capturing the entire mountainous area north of Garo-ri to Sammok-gol, Sudong-ri, Sonu-mok, and Tongseon-gol on the left bank of the Bukhan River. In the above battles, our army annihilated more than 8,700 enemy troops and advanced the front line in this area six kilometers to the south.

    Another powerful counterattack was carried out in the area south of Jwaseo-dong on the right bank of the Bukhan River. On the night of the 12th, our army captured the main positions of the 21st Regiment of the Rhee's puppet 8th Division in one fell swoop, wiping out the majority of an enemy regiment stationed there. After repelling more than 30 enemy counterattacks that night, we immediately advanced in a southwest direction, and by the 14th, our army had completely occupied the mountain ridges northeast of Ryongho-dong and Songsil-ri. In this counterattack and battle for control, our army annihilated more than 8,900 enemy troops and advanced the front line in this area three kilometers to the south.

    Our army annihilated a total of 70,122 enemy troops this month, including 62,818 of Syngman Rhee's puppet army. Enemy units annihilated in their entirety included the front command post of one regiment, two battalion headquarters, five complete battalions, thirty-five complete companies, forty-one complete platoons, and ten complete squads, as well as the majority of another battalion command post, twelve complete battalions, twenty-seven complete companies, and eight platoons, and a portion of twelve battalions and three companies. Our army captured a total of 191 enemy artillery pieces of various types, 5,441 guns of various types, 12 tanks, 28 vehicles, and 329 important communication equipment items. We shot down or damaged 580 enemy aircraft and destroyed or damaged 76 enemy tanks, 271 vehicles, and 264 artillery pieces of various types.

    In the counterattacks, our army not only had the strength to break through the enemy's front lines and occupy the enemy's company and platoon positions but also had the strength to wedge into the enemy's depths, occupy the enemy's battalion and regimental positions, and disrupt the enemy's defense system.

    Syngman Rhee's puppet army suffered heavy losses this month. The 5th and 8th Divisions have been crippled, and many battalions have only a few dozen to about a hundred men left.

    朝中部队六月份歼敌七万
    叫喊单独北犯的李承晚的伪军损失惨重
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】朝中人民军队在暑热的六月份，除了进行一百八十次袭击、阻击等战斗外，展开了更加广泛、更加强大的反击战，击退敌军一个排至四个营的近千次反扑，使正面战线上的敌军部队，尤其使正叫喊着单独向北打到鸭绿江去的李承晚所恃的武装力量——南朝鲜部队遭受了惨重的损失。
    六月份我军的反击战是在五月份取得夏季反击作战初步胜利的基础上进行的。从五月中旬到六月底止，我军的反击作战最初在北汉江两岸——东线和西线交界的地区进行，以后在西线临津江右岸的高浪浦里西北地区进行，六月初转到东海岸高城以南地区进行，到六月中旬又在北汉江两岸进行。战斗一次紧接一次，规模逐渐扩大，据守坚固阵地的敌军都无法挡住我军强力的打击。
    北汉江两岸的战斗，是六月份各地反击战中规模最大和歼敌最多的战斗。六月十日夜，我军只经五十分钟的战斗，即攻占北汉江左岸边岩洞附近八八三点七及九零二点一两座高山，据守在这两座高山周围十平方公里的山岭阵地上的李伪军第五师二十七团大部被歼灭，打开了敌军防线的第一个缺口。我军在发起攻击之前，向这一片山包发射了非常猛烈的炮火，步兵部队乘敌军混乱之际向前猛插，迅速占领了敌军的全部阵地。在我军攻占这个阵地后，李伪军匆匆调来它的第三师和第五师的后备兵力投入战斗，在四天之中向我进行了一百多次反扑，企图夺回他们丢失的阵地。但我军不仅击败了敌军所有的反扑，而且又发起了两次较大的反击，将北汉江左岸沿加罗峙至三幕谷、水洞里、孙右目、通先谷以北的一带山区全部攻占。以上战斗，我军共歼敌八千七百多名，将这一线的阵地向南推进了六公里。
    另一次强大的反击是在北汉江右岸座首洞以南地区进行的。十二日夜里，我军一举攻占李伪军第八师二十一团的主要阵地，全歼守敌一个团大部，并在当夜击退敌人三十多次反扑之后，即乘胜向西南方向推进，战斗至十四日，我军已将龙虎洞、松室里东北的一带山岭完全占领。我军在这次反击和争夺战中，共歼敌八千九百多名，将这一线阵地向南推进了三公里。
    我军在这个月共计歼灭敌军七万零一百二十二名，其中李承晚伪军六万二千八百十八名。成建制地被歼的敌军部队，计有一个团的前线指挥所、两个营部、五个整营、三十五个整连、四十一个整排、十个整班的全部，另一个营指挥所、十二个整营、二十七个整连、八个排的大部，十二个营、三个连的一部。我军共缴获敌各种炮一百九十一门，各种枪五千四百四十一支，坦克十二辆，汽车二十八辆，重要通讯器材三百二十九件，击落、击伤敌机五百八十架，击毁、击伤敌坦克七十六辆，汽车二百七十一辆，各种炮二百六十四门。
    在反击战中，我军不仅有力量突破敌军的前沿，占领敌军的连排阵地，而且有力量楔入敌军纵深，占领敌军的营团阵地，打乱敌军的防御体系。
    李承晚伪军在这一个月中遭到了惨重的损失，其中第五师、第八师已被打成残废，许多营只剩下几十人到一百人左右。
