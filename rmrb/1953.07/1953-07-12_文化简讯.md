East China Actively Prepares for This Year's University Enrollment Work

East China is actively preparing for this year's university enrollment work. The East China Higher Education Bureau of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government convened cadres responsible for enrollment work from various provinces (cities) in Shanghai from July 3rd to 6th for three and a half days of intensive study. The main purpose of this study was to summarize the experience of last year's enrollment work, further clarify the significance and requirements of this year's enrollment work, so as to do a better job in this year's enrollment. The East China University Enrollment Work Committee was officially established on the 7th, with Chen Wangdao, Director of the East China Higher Education Bureau, and Meng Xiancheng, Director of the Education Bureau of the East China Administrative Committee, serving as Director and Deputy Director, respectively. On the same day, the East China Enrollment Work Conference was held to discuss in detail the principles, tasks, and specific implementation methods of this year's university enrollment work in East China. The meeting determined that five provinces and Shanghai in East China should establish enrollment work committee branches before the 15th of this month to organize enrollment work in each province and city's test areas. Before students apply for the examination, the local education administrative departments, relevant secondary schools, and enrollment institutions will provide timely guidance to candidates on further education.

Northwest University's Physics Department Self-Manufactures a Large Number of Physics Instruments

	Solved the Difficulty of Insufficient Instrument Supply

The Physics Department of Northwest University has self-manufactured a batch of ordinary physics instruments and other experimental equipment, saving funds for the country and solving the current difficulty of insufficient instrument supply in China. The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government has written a letter to Northwest University, praising the achievements of the school's Physics Department in manufacturing instruments.

Originally, only sixty students at Northwest University were doing physics experiments. This year, due to the increase in students, more than two hundred and eighty students are doing physics experiments, and the number of instruments is far from meeting the needs of teaching. Lecturers, teaching assistants, and technicians in the school's Physics Department used their brains to find solutions. For more than half a year, they have repaired and assembled 122 sets of instruments, including physical pendulum, moment of inertia, torsional constant, optical lever, spherometer, free fall apparatus, tuning fork, Joule's spring balance, air density meter, Boyle's law experiment apparatus, air thermometer, water equivalent and specific heat measuring instrument, Young's modulus instrument, linear expansion measuring instrument, magnetometer, heat of fusion and heat of vaporization measuring instrument, Kundt's tube Wheatstone wire bridge resonance tube, suspension line magnetometer, micrometer screw, Hale's hydrometer, etc. They also made more than 400 sets of instruments, including various brackets for optical benches, double plane mirrors, meter sticks, carburetors, glass blowing torches, and mercury distillation apparatus. The Physics Department also helped other departments of the school to repair some instruments and other parts.

    华东积极准备今年高等学校招生工作
    华东区积极进行今年高等学校招生准备工作。中央人民政府高等教育部华东高等教育管理局在七月三日到六日召集各省（市）负责招生工作的干部在上海进行了三天半集中学习。这次学习主要是总结去年招生工作经验，进一步明确今年招生工作的意义和要求，使今年的招生工作做得更好。华东区高等学校招生工作委员会已在七日正式成立，由华东高等教育管理局局长陈望道、华东行政委员会教育局局长孟宪承分任主任、副主任。同日，举行了华东区招生工作会议，详细讨论了今年高等学校招生工作的方针、任务和华东区具体实施的办法。会上确定华东区五省和上海市都应在本月十五日以前成立招生工作委员会分会，组织各该省、市考区的招生工作。在学生报考前，各地教育行政部门、各有关中等学校及招生机构，都将及时对考生进行升学指导。
    西北大学物理系自行修造大量物理仪器
    解决了仪器供应不足的困难
    西北大学物理系自行修造了一批普通物理仪器和其他实验设备，为国家节省了经费，并解决目前国内仪器供应不足的困难。中央人民政府高等教育部已写信给西北大学，表扬该校物理系修造仪器的成绩。
    西北大学原来作物理实验的学生只有六十人，今年因学生增加，作物理实验的达到二百八十多人，仪器的数量远不能适应教学的需要。该校物理系讲师、助教和技工们开动脑筋找窍门，半年多以来，已修配了符合摆、转动惯量、刚性系数、光杠杆、球径计、自由落体、音叉、焦耳氏弹簧秤、空气密度仪、波义耳定律试验器、空气温度计、水当量及比热测定器、杨氏弹性系数仪、线膨胀测定器、磁强计、融解热及汽化热测定器、昆特管惠斯顿线式电桥共鸣管、悬线磁强计、测微螺旋、海尔氏比重仪等一百二十二套仪器，还制成了光具座各种支架、双平面镜、米尺、化油器、烧玻璃喷灯、水银蒸馏器等四百多件套仪器。物理系还帮助该校其他部门修造了一些仪器和其他机件。
