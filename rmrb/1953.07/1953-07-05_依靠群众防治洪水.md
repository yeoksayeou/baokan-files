Rely on the Masses to Prevent and Control Floods

　　This spring, many regions suffered from natural disasters such as cold waves, wind, drought, and insects, causing considerable losses to agricultural production. In order to strive for increased autumn grain production, we must continuously fight against various natural disasters. Now that the rainy season has arrived, most rivers are facing flood season. Areas along rivers and areas prone to mountain floods and waterlogging should quickly mobilize the masses to prevent and control floods.

　　In recent years, the water conservancy departments of the Central People's Government and the masses in various regions have built many water conservancy projects, which have played a considerable role in preventing floods. However, it must not be assumed that relying solely on these existing projects can eliminate all flood disasters. Fighting against floods is still a long-term and complex task for us; especially the existing mountain floods and waterlogging disasters cannot be eliminated in the short term by relying on water conservancy projects. At any time, the most reliable and most important force for flood prevention is still the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for flood prevention; all flood prevention organizations, without the support of the broad masses of farmers, will inevitably be formalistic. This is especially true when our water conservancy projects are far from being able to control all floods. Most of our existing water conservancy projects are not strong enough or lack modern equipment, and still require more manpower to repair and assist. It is naturally correct for us to start with some rivers that have the greatest impact and are most urgently needed when carrying out water conservancy construction, and to carry out key projects. However, when carrying out flood prevention work, we must take care of the overall situation and not ignore the flood prevention work of small and medium-sized rivers and flood and waterlogging prevention work in various regions. These tasks can obviously only be carried out by the broad masses using manpower. To prevent mountain floods, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to dam mountain gullies; to drain waterlogging, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to dig ditches. These things are relatively simple and easy to do, and doing a little more will yield a little more results.

　　A major shortcoming of flood prevention work in various regions is that the leading organs and the masses are not closely integrated. For example, in some areas, the flood prevention work is only manifested in cadres running around, without mobilizing the masses. Many flood prevention organizations are merely formalistic and have not truly organized into mass flood prevention teams. This phenomenon cannot but attract the attention of the leading organs. Comrade Mao Zedong told us in "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership": "If only the activism of the leading core is combined without the activism of the broad masses, it will become a busy work of a few people." We must also pay attention to correcting this phenomenon in flood prevention work. The entire plan and deployment of flood prevention should be made known to the masses as much as possible. All areas that are prepared to store and detain floods must be explained to the masses in advance; persuasion and mobilization work should be carried out as early as possible so that the masses understand the principle of subordinating small interests to large interests and subordinating local interests to overall interests; for the masses in the flood storage and detention zones, proper arrangements must be made as early as possible, and compensation methods must be stipulated in advance and announced to the masses to dispel their concerns and stabilize their production mood; appropriate care should be given to the production of farmers participating in flood prevention work; a more thorough plan should be made as early as possible for the mobilization of mass forces; efforts should be made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of water conditions and rainfall; in short, efforts should be made not to waste the labor of the masses, ensuring both that flood prevention work is done well and that agricultural production is not delayed.

　　The masses in various regions have a lot of experience in fighting floods. Leading cadres should go deep among the masses to study and summarize them, and promote them with leadership according to the specific local conditions. The local masses know best about the highest water level that may occur in various places and the places where floods are most likely to occur. Leading cadres should go deep among the masses to investigate and record, and combine with current needs to plan specific methods for flood control work. The leading organs should conduct specific guidance and regular inspections of the flood control work that has been deployed. The leading organs should have sufficient estimates and in-depth understanding of the emotions of the masses and the situation of the disaster, and conduct specific analysis and propose specific methods.

　　The instructions on flood prevention work issued by the Central Flood Prevention Headquarters on May 6 should be universally and conscientiously implemented throughout the country. All regions should make thorough arrangements for the mobilization of mass forces and the preparation of flood prevention materials; flood control work should be closely integrated with drought prevention and resistance work, with unified leadership, so as not to cause the phenomenon of taking care of one thing and losing sight of the other. As long as we rely closely on the masses, discuss effective methods with the masses, and do everything possible to overcome the threat of floods, we will definitely be able to ensure increased autumn grain production and protect the lives and property of the people and the safety of industry, mining, transportation.

### 依靠群众防治洪水

    依靠群众防治洪水
    今春许多地区遭受了寒流、风、旱、虫等自然灾害，农业生产已遭受了相当损失。为了争取秋粮增产，必须和各种自然灾害进行不断的斗争。现在雨季已到，大部分河流面临汛期，沿河地区和山洪、内涝容易发生的地区，应迅速动员群众防治洪水。
    几年来，中央人民政府水利部门和各地群众修了不少水利工程，对于防御水灾起了相当大的作用。可是，决不能认为只是依靠这些已有的工程，就可以消除一切水患。和洪水作斗争，还是我们的一个长期的复杂的任务；特别是现有的山洪和内涝的灾害，更不是短期能够依靠水利工程来消除的。不论什么时候，防汛的最可靠的最主要的力量仍是广大农民群众对于防汛的积极性；一切防汛机构，如果没有广大农民群众来支持，就必然是形式主义的。特别是在我们的水利工程还远不能控制全部洪水的情形下，更是这样。我们已有的水利工程，大部分还不够坚固或缺乏近代化的设备，仍须有较多的人力加以培修和辅助。我们在进行水利建设的时候，首先从影响最大、需要最迫切的一些河流入手，有重点地进行，自然是正确的。可是，在进行防汛工作时，就必须妥善地照顾全面，不可忽视中小河流的防汛工作和各地的防洪防涝工作。而这些工作，显然只能依靠广大群众用人力来进行。为防止山洪，要发动群众闸山沟；为排泄内涝，要发动群众挖沟洫。这些事情是比较简单易行的，多做一点就会多得一点效果。
    各地防汛工作当前的一个主要缺点就是领导机关和群众没有密切地结合起来。如有些地区，在防汛工作上表现出来的，只是干部跑来跑去，没有把群众发动起来。不少防汛组织都是徒具形式的，并没有真正组织成防汛的群众队伍。这种现象不能不引起领导机关的注意。毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”中告诉我们：“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无广大群众的积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙。”我们在防汛工作中也必须注意纠正这种现象。防汛的全部计划和部署，应当尽可能让群众知道。凡是准备蓄洪滞洪的地区，必须事先向群众讲明；及早进行说服动员工作，使群众明白小利服从大利、局部服从整体的道理；对于蓄洪滞洪地带的群众，必须及早作出妥善的安排，并且事先规定补偿的办法，向群众宣布，解除群众的顾虑，安定群众的生产情绪；对于参加防汛工作的农民的生产，应有妥善的照顾；对于群众力量的动员，要及早作出比较周密的计划；对于水情雨情的预报，要力求准确；总之要力求不浪费群众的劳动力，既保证做好防汛工作，又不误农业生产。
    各地群众都有不少与水灾作斗争的经验，领导干部应当深入群众加以研究总结，根据当地具体情况，有领导地加以推行，各地可能发生的最高水位，最易发生水患的地点，当地群众都是了解得最清楚的，领导干部应当深入群众加以调查记录，结合目前的需要，策划防洪工作的具体办法。领导机关对于已经布置的防洪工作要进行具体指导和经常检查。领导机关对于群众的情绪和灾害的情况要有足够的估计和深入的了解，并加以具体分析，提出具体办法来。
    中央防汛总指挥部五月六日发出的防汛工作指示，应在全国各地普遍认真执行。对于群众力量的动员、防汛器材的准备，各地都应该作周密的布置；要把防洪工作紧密地和防旱抗旱工作结合起来，统一领导，不使发生顾此失彼的现象。只要紧密依靠群众，和群众共同商量有效的办法，尽一切力量战胜洪水的威胁，我们就一定能够保证秋粮增产，保卫人民生命财产和工矿、交通的安全。
