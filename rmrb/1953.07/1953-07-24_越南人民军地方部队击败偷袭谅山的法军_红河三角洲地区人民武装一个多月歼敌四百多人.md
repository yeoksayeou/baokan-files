(Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd) Vietnam News Agency reported on the 22nd, citing government sources, that Vietnamese People's Army local forces had crushed a French paratrooper attack on Lang Son a few days ago.

On the morning of July 17th, at 6:00 AM, approximately two battalions of French troops were airdropped around the Lang Son provincial capital, which had already been evacuated of residents. The French paratroopers encountered fierce resistance from local People's Army forces as soon as they began landing, suffering heavy losses. The French were forced to use helicopters to transport many seriously wounded back to Hanoi.

The landed French troops searched caves in Ersheng and Sansheng, one to two kilometers from Lang Son. In Ersheng, they found no important material storage, only burning some old machinery and vehicle repair tools. In Sansheng Cave, the local Vietnamese People's Army forces bravely fought the attacking French troops for four hours, preventing them from entering the cave.

At 4:00 PM that afternoon, fearing encirclement by regular People's Army forces, the French paratroopers hastily withdrew southeast from Lang Son.

Another French force also scurried from Tien Yen to Dinh Lap to meet the French paratroopers withdrawing from Lang Son. People's Army units intercepted this French force on the 17th and 18th, pursuing the remnants of the French troops fleeing towards Tien Yen.

A spokesman for the People's Army Headquarters pointed out that the purpose of the French army's recent paratrooper attack on Lang Son was primarily to destroy the warehouses of the People's Army local forces. Secondly, it was intended to cheer on the newly appointed French Commander-in-Chief of Indochina, Navarre, cover up the French army's consecutive failures in recent days, and support the French reactionaries in begging the United States for more money and weapons.

(Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd) According to Vietnam News Agency, in June and early July, Vietnamese People's Army local forces and guerrillas conducted multiple counter-sweep operations and ambushes in various parts of the Red River Delta, destroying 17 French army trucks and tanks, and eliminating more than 400 French troops.

During this period, the People's Army local forces and guerrillas in Thai Binh province, where the Red River flows into the sea, were very active. From June 20th to 22nd, they killed or wounded 140 French troops in the counter-sweep operation in the Dong Quan area. On July 6th, they killed or wounded 40 French troops, captured 146, and seized many guns and cannons in another battle.

People's Army local forces and guerrillas in Hai Duong, Hung Yen, and Bac Giang provinces constantly attacked French transportation lines. Guerrillas in Hai Duong province destroyed eight French army trucks and three tanks, killing or wounding 50 French troops, in ambushes. People's Army local forces in Bac Giang province destroyed five French military vehicles, including three tanks.

(Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, July 22nd) According to Vietnam News Agency, farmers throughout Vietnam are actively protecting river dikes and building water conservancy projects, striving to realize the slogan of "increasing production and protecting crops."

The people of two counties in Quang Ngai province, after fourteen months of effort, have dug a canal that can irrigate 2,200 hectares of water-scarce land.

Farmers in Hai Duong province reinforced the Lu Jiang dikes under the most difficult conditions. They persisted in repairing the dikes despite harassment and bombardment by the French colonial troops. Farmers in two counties completed the reinforcement of two important dike sections, each five kilometers long, in two months, and repaired two large cracks in the dikes, saving tens of thousands of hectares of farmland from flooding.

    越南人民军地方部队击败偷袭谅山的法军
    红河三角洲地区人民武装一个多月歼敌四百多人
    【新华社二十三日讯】越南通讯社在二十二日引政府方面的消息说：越南人民军地方部队在几天前粉碎了法军伞兵对谅山的一次偷袭。
    七月十七日上午六时，法军约两个营空降到居民早已疏散了的谅山省会周围。法军伞兵在开始降落时即遭到人民军地方部队的猛烈抗击，损失惨重。法军不得不用直升飞机将许多重伤员运回河内。
    降落的法军搜索了距谅山一、二公里的二声、三声等洞窟。他们在二声地方找不到重要的物资储藏，只燃毁了一些破旧的机器和修理车辆用的工具。在三声洞窟，越南人民军地方部队英勇地与进攻的法军作战了四小时，使法军始终未能进入洞窟。
    当天下午四时，法国伞兵害怕人民军正规部队的围攻，连忙从谅山向东南方向撤退。
    另一支法军并从先安窜到亭立，接应从谅山撤出的法国伞兵。人民军部队在十七日和十八日截击了这支法军，并追击向先安方面逃跑的法军残部。
    人民军总部发言人指出，法军最近用伞兵偷袭谅山的目的，首先是想破坏人民军地方部队的仓库，其次是想给新上台的印度支那法军总司令纳瓦尔捧场，掩饰法军几天来的接连失败，并支持法国反动派向美国乞求更多的钱和武器。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社讯：六月份和七月初，越南人民军地方部队和游击队在红河三角洲各地进行了多次反扫荡战和伏击战，击毁法军卡车和坦克十七辆，歼灭法军四百多人。
    在这期间，红河入海处太平省境内的人民军地方部队和游击队非常活跃。他们从六月二十日到二十二日在同关地区的反扫荡战中，杀伤法军一百四十人。七月六日，他们又在作战中杀伤法军四十人，俘掳一百四十六人，缴获许多枪炮。
    海阳、兴安、北江等省的人民军地方部队和游击队不断袭击法军的运输线。海阳省的游击队在伏击战中打坏法军卡车八辆和坦克三辆，杀伤法军五十人；北江省的人民军地方部队击毁法国军车五辆，其中有坦克三辆。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南各地农民积极保护河堤和兴修水利，努力实现“提高生产，保护庄稼”的口号。
    广义省两个县人民经过十四个月的努力，已挖好了一条运河，可以灌溉二千二百公顷缺水的土地。
    海阳省农民在最困难的条件下加固禄江的江堤。他们不顾法国殖民军队的骚扰和炮轰，坚持修堤。有两个县的农民在两个月中完成了两条各长五公里的重要堤段的加固工作，并修好了江堤上的两个大裂缝，使好几万公顷的田地免遭水灾。
