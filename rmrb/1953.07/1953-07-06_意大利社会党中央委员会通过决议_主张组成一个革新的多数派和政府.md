Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 5th dispatch: According to TASS, recently the leading bodies of the Italian political parties have been discussing the question of forming a new government. The Christian Democratic Party suffered a defeat in the June 7th elections, making it unable to form a government alone. Therefore, Saragat, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, suggested that the Christian Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Socialist Party form a new government. At the same time, he put forward a condition that the Socialist Party abandon its agreement of united action with the Communist Party and stop opposing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party, at its plenary session held from June 28th to 30th, responded to the essence of this proposal.

The party's General Secretary, Nenni, reported on this issue, saying: Judging from the current position adopted by the Christian Democratic Party, it is entirely conceivable that the government being established will be subject to the emotions and attitudes of the internally divided ruling group, and therefore its fate will be pitiful. The approach that should be taken is not to pull the parties together to achieve a possible rapprochement between the parties of the 1946 coalition government or between the Socialist Party and the Christian Democratic Party. To achieve this rapprochement, it should not rely on the advocacy and collusion of certain people, nor on the temptation of high positions and generous salaries, nor on ephemeral agreements, but on clear and open political agreements. On the basis of this agreement, a political program reflecting peace, democratic order, and social progress should be formulated. Therefore, Saragat's proposal is entirely wrong in its presentation. If it cannot be guaranteed that the parliament and the country can carry out effective activities for many years and make organized progress, then it is meaningless for the Italian Socialist Party to shift from an opposition stance to a cooperative stance. Only those who advocate a more resolute turn to the right will say that our agreement of united action with the Communist Party contradicts the establishment of democratic unity in parliament.

During the discussion, the party's Deputy General Secretary, Rodolfo Morandi, emphasized that the Christian Democratic Party's so-called "middle-of-the-road" policy is actually a right-wing policy. Morandi called for strengthening the struggle for peace so that the government cannot undermine the people's efforts to ease international tensions. Morandi said: The economic and trade union struggles must be strengthened to force the government and business owners to stop conducting a "cold war" against the working people. It is also necessary to continuously consolidate the agreement of united action with the Communist Party, because this is a powerful tool to attract broad strata of the people. Only by uniting the broad masses of the people around the two working-class parties can a majority be established domestically and in parliament that can solve the most pressing national problems.

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Italian Socialist Party unanimously passed a resolution, pointing out that the Italian Socialist Party Central Committee's proposal for resolving the crisis is: to form a majority and government that will carry out the renovations desired by the people. The Central Committee believes that the Christian Democratic Party National Committee's decision to maintain the same old faces and old policies is an attempt to create stagnation. To change this situation, new steps and policies must be taken.

    意大利社会党中央委员会通过决议
    主张组成一个革新的多数派和政府
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：最近，意大利各政党的领导机构在讨论组织新政府的问题。天主教民主党在六月七日的选举中遭到了失败，使它不能单独组织政府。因此，社会民主党的领导人萨拉盖特建议由天主教民主党、社会民主党和社会党组成新政府。同时他提出一个条件，要社会党放弃它和共产党一致行动的协定，并停止反对北大西洋公约。
    意大利社会党中央委员会在六月二十八日至三十日举行的全体会议，对这个建议的本质作了答复。
    党的总书记南尼就这个问题作报告说：从天主教民主党目前采取的立场看来，完全可以设想：正在建立中的政府既然要受内部互相倾轧的统治集团的情绪和态度所左右，因此它的命运将是可怜的。应当采取的办法，并不是把各党派拉在一起，来达到一九四六年联合政府各党派之间或者是社会党和天主教民主党之间的可能的接近。要达到这种接近，不是靠某些人的倡议和勾结，不是靠高官厚爵的引诱，也不是靠昙花一现的协议，而是要靠明确的、公开的政治协议。在这种协议的基础上，要制订出一个反映和平、民主秩序、社会进步的政治纲领。因此，萨拉盖特的建议，其全部提法是错误的。如果不能保证议会和国家能进行多年的有效的活动，能作有组织的进步，那么，意大利社会党从反对立场转到合作立场是没有什么意义的。只有那些主张更加坚决地向右转的人，才会说：我们和共产党一致行动的协定与在议会里建立民主团结相矛盾。
    在讨论中，党的副总书记罗多夫·摩兰迪着重指出：天主教民主党的所谓“中间”政策，实际上是右派政策。摩兰迪号召加强和平斗争，使政府不能破坏人民为缓和国际紧张局势而作的努力。摩兰迪说：必须加强经济方面和工会方面的斗争，迫使政府和企业主停止对劳动人民进行“冷战”。还要继续不断地巩固和共产党一致行动的协定，因为这是吸引广大阶层人民的强有力的工具。只有把广大的人民群众团结在两个工人阶级政党的周围，才能够在国内和议会中建立一个能够解决最迫切的全国性问题的多数派。
    意大利社会党中央委员会全体会议一致通过了一个决议，指出意大利社会党中央委员会解决危机的主张是：组成一个进行人民所渴望的革新的多数派和政府。中央委员会认为天主教民主党全国委员会希望维持原班人马和老政策的决定，是企图造成停滞局面。要改变这种局面，必须采取新的步骤和方针。
