Most of the key industrial construction projects in the Northeast region have commenced. This year, the workload of key projects in the Northeast region is very large, accounting for more than 40 percent of the total basic construction workload in the region, and the construction area accounts for more than 30 percent of the total construction area in the region. These are crucial heavy industrial construction projects that will accelerate the country's industrialization.

Currently, the main or all parts of these projects have commenced, including 30 units such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Fourth Electrical Engineering Factory, the Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory, the Pneumatic Tool Factory, the Second Petroleum Factory, and the Ninth Petroleum Factory. The civil engineering of these projects has mostly begun bricklaying and column erection; the metal framework is also beginning to be hoisted, and construction is in a tense stage; the progress of the projects has generally completed about 20 to 30 percent of the annual plan. The large rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, which started construction last year, are currently installing and adjusting complete sets of new equipment, and several power plants are also busily installing generators. In coal mine shaft construction, the excavation of eleven main and auxiliary shaft barrels has been completed, and construction has now shifted to underground yards and roadways.

Other key projects that are currently underway mostly involve minor parts, auxiliary projects, or prefabricated projects, including 10 units such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the First Machinery Factory, the Fushun Electrical Machinery Factory, and the Seventh Electrical Engineering Factory. However, except for a few projects where the start time will be delayed due to the design and equipment not being supplied as planned, the main factory buildings and line construction projects can also be started successively within July, and some have already begun excavating foundation earthwork.

    东北区重点工程大部开工
    东北全区工业建设的重点工程已大部动工。今年，东北区重点工程的工作量很大，占全区基本建设工作总量的百分之四十以上，建筑面积占全区建设总面积的百分之三十多。这些都是对加速祖国工业化有决定意义的一些重工业建设工程。
    目前，这些工程的主要部分或全部已经开工的有鞍山钢铁公司、电工四厂、量具刃具厂、风动工具厂、石油二厂、石油九厂等三十个单位。他们的土建工程大部分已开始砌砖立柱；金属构架也正在开始吊装，施工正处于紧张阶段；工程进度一般都已完成全年计划的百分之二十到三十左右。去年就已动工的鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂，目前正安装、调整成套的新式设备，几个发电站也在紧张地安装发电机。煤矿竖井建设已完成十一个主、副井井筒的掘进工程，现已转入井下车场、巷道等工程的施工。
    另一些重点工程目前开工的则多是次要部分、附属工程或预制工程，这有第一汽车制造厂、机械一厂、抚顺电机厂、电工七厂等十个单位。但其中除个别工程因设计和设备未能按计划供应，开工时间将拖后外，主要厂房和线路建设工程，在七月内也都能相继开工，有的现在已经开始挖基础土方。
