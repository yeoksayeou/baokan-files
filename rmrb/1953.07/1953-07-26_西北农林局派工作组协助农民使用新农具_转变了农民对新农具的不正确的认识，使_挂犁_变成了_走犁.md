    The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Bureau Sends Work Team to Assist Farmers in Using New Agricultural Tools, Changing Farmers' Incorrect Perceptions of New Agricultural Tools, Turning "Hanging Plows" into "Working Plows"
    In late April of this year, the Northwest Administrative Committee's Agricultural and Forestry Bureau dispatched 31 technical personnel (including 8 technical cadres and 23 agricultural implement manufacturing workers) to form two mobile work teams, carrying repair tools to Baoji and Weinan Special Districts in Shaanxi Province to assist farmers in installing and repairing new-style agricultural implements and teaching techniques for using new-style agricultural implements. Over a period of about one month, the two work teams repaired 1,002 new-style walking plows, 13 waterwheels, and 43 sprayers for the masses, installed 17 new-style walking plows, and taught 39 carpenters how to repair and install new-style agricultural implements. This changed the farmers' incorrect perceptions of new-style agricultural implements, turning many past "hanging plows" into "working plows."
    In the past, in the work of promoting new-style agricultural implements in various parts of Shaanxi Province, there was a widespread problem of forced allocation. After the agricultural implements were distributed to the farmers, the farmers neither knew how to install or repair them, nor how to use them. After the mobile work teams arrived in Baoji and other places, they systematically and repeatedly publicized the benefits and usage methods of new-style agricultural implements to the masses, and selected key areas to educate farmers with concrete facts. The mobile work team that went to Baoji Special District selected Hancun Township and Xiaocun Township in Wolong District, Baoji County, as the focus of their work. When new-style walking plows were promoted in these two townships in 1952, cadres allocated them according to the number of mutual aid teams and mu of land (one plow was lent for every forty mu of land). A total of 509 plows were allocated to the two townships. However, most of these plows were missing parts. Although 419 of them were installed, they were not up to standard and difficult to use, and only 6 were actually used. After the work team arrived in these two townships this time, they adopted the method of "simultaneous publicity, repair, and experimentation." In addition to conducting ideological mobilization through holding seminars and individual visits, when repairing and using new-style agricultural implements, they always repaired each plow until it was free of problems and the farmers publicly recognized it as a good plow. The farmers received practical education and also learned the techniques of using, simple repairing, and installation. (Li Yunhu)

    西北农林局派工作组协助农民使用新农具
    转变了农民对新农具的不正确的认识，使“挂犁”变成了“走犁”
    今年四月下旬，西北行政委员会农林局派出技术工作人员三十一人（包括技术干部八人，制造农具工人二十三人），组成两个巡回工作小组，携带修理工具分头到陕西省的宝鸡、渭南两个专区协助农民安装修配新式农具和传授使用新式农具的技术。两个工作组在前后约一个多月的时期中，共为群众修理好新式步犁一千零二部，水车十三辆，喷雾器四十三架，安装了新式步犁十七部，并教会了三十九个木匠修理、安装新式农具，这就改变了农民对新式农具的不正确认识，使过去的很多“挂犁”都变成了“走犁”。
    陕西省各地过去在推广新式农具工作中，普遍存在强迫摊派的毛病。农具推广到农民手里以后，农民既不会安装修理，也不会使用。巡回工作组到达宝鸡等地后，系统地向群众反复宣传新式农具的好处和使用方法，并选择重点地区以具体事实向农民进行教育。到宝鸡专区的巡回工作组选择了宝鸡县卧龙区韩村乡和小村乡为工作重点。这两个乡在一九五二年推广新式步犁时，是由干部按互助组和田亩数字来摊派的（每四十亩田贷发一部犁）。两乡共摊派了五百零九部犁。但这些犁大部缺少零件，其中虽安装好了四百十九部，也都不合规格，不好使用，真正使用起来的只有六部。这次工作组到达这两个乡以后，采取了“一边宣传，一边修理实验”的方法。他们除去以开座谈会、个别访问的办法进行思想动员外，在修理和使用新式农具时，总是每修理一部犁，一直修到它不出毛病，农民公认为好犁时为止。农民受到实际教育，也懂得了使用和简单的修理、安装技术。（李运笏）
