    Celebrating the Construction of China's First Automobile Manufacturing Plant
    The construction project of China's first automobile manufacturing plant has begun. The construction of this automobile plant is a joyous event in the lives of the Chinese people and will further inspire the confidence of the Chinese people in building the motherland.
    In the past, under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang, China basically had no automobile industry. Even the few small automobile repair shops, like the entire machinery industry, were mainly repairing parts for machinery and transportation equipment imported by imperialists, and could not manufacture internal combustion engines at all. This situation kept China's machinery industry at an extremely low technical level for a long time. However, in less than four years since the founding of New China, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China's first automobile manufacturing plant has now begun construction. This automobile factory is equipped with new Soviet equipment. Its future production process will be built on the basis of a high level of technology. After the completion of this factory, it will not only be of great significance for strengthening China's economic construction and national defense construction, but also, due to its high technical level, it will promote the technological level of China's machinery manufacturing industry to move forward. Without modern technology as a foundation, it is impossible to fundamentally transform our backward national economy.
    The construction of this first automobile plant once again proves that China's industrial construction has many superior conditions. Of course, for us, there are many difficulties in building such a modern factory. However, its construction preparation work has been able to proceed rapidly and smoothly because more than 30 provinces and cities have sent it various cadres and workers, and more than 70 factories have rushed to produce various building materials and equipment for it. This shows that in the People's Democratic China, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the working masses will infinitely unleash their enthusiasm and creativity, so that the difficulties of manpower, materials, and financial resources can be overcome; at the same time, due to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country, the difficulties of insufficient technology, equipment, and experience can also be overcome.
    In order to build this factory, the Soviet government sent experts to specifically guide us in selecting the factory site, surveying the geology, collecting data, and formulating the planning task book, and helped us with the design. We express our heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their tremendous assistance to us; we deeply understand that this assistance is another concrete manifestation of the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union. This is just as Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The problem is not only that this kind of help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is first of all that the foundation of this cooperation is a sincere desire for mutual help and for the common economic uplift."
    In order to ensure that China's first automobile manufacturing plant can be completed according to plan, all of our people must, from now on, support this huge construction project with high enthusiasm and greater effort.

### 庆祝我国第一个汽车制造厂的兴建

    庆祝我国第一个汽车制造厂的兴建
    我国第一个汽车制造厂的建厂工程已经开始了。这个汽车厂的建设是我国人民生活中的一件喜事，并将进一步鼓舞着我国人民建设祖国的信心。
    过去，在帝国主义和国民党统治下，我国基本上没有汽车工业，即便有一些小型的汽车修配厂，也和整个机械工业一样，基本上是给帝国主义输入的机器设备和运输工具修配零件的，根本不能制造内燃机。这种情况，使我国机器工业长期处在极低的技术水平上。但是在新中国成立还不到四年的期间，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在苏联的无私援助下，我国的第一个汽车制造厂现在已开始兴建了。这个汽车工厂是以苏联新式的设备装备起来的。它将来的生产过程，是建筑在高度技术水平的基础上的。这个工厂建成以后，不只对于加强我国经济建设和国防建设有着重大的意义，而且由于它的高度技术水平，也将推动我国机器制造业的技术水平前进一步。没有现代的技术作基础，是不可能从根本上改造我们落后的国民经济的。
    这第一个汽车厂的建设，再度证明了我国工业建设具有很多的优越条件。当然，对于我们来说，建设这样的一个现代化工厂是有许多困难的。但是，它的施工准备工作，因有三十多个省市给它输送各种干部和工人，有七十多个工厂为它赶制各种建筑材料和器械，就能够迅速而顺利地进行起来。这说明了在人民民主的中国，在中国共产党的英明领导下，劳动群众将无限地发挥自己的积极性和创造性，使人力、物力、财力的困难可以克服；同时，由于有苏联对我国无私的援助，技术、设备和经验不足等困难也是可以克服的。
    为了建设这个工厂，苏联政府派专家来具体指导我们选择厂址，勘测地质，搜集资料和制订计划任务书。并帮助我们进行设计。我们对苏联政府和苏联人民给予我们的巨大援助，表示衷心的感谢；我们更深深地了解，这种援助是中苏两国牢不可破的友谊的又一具体表现。这正如斯大林同志所指出过的：“问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”
    为了使我国第一个汽车制造厂能按计划建成，今后我们全国人民更要以高度的热忱和更大的努力来支持这个巨大的建设工程。
