Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 11th: Special correspondent Wu Min reports: The two sides held a secret meeting at Panmunjom for the second consecutive day to discuss how to implement the armistice terms. Due to Syngman Rhee's serious sabotage of the prisoner-of-war agreement, and because the U.S. side did not take effective steps to prevent him from further undermining this agreement, the preparation for the signing of the armistice agreement has been delayed for more than three weeks.

Observers here pointed out that the United Nations Commander-in-Chief Clark's reply to the question of ensuring the implementation of the armistice agreement's terms was vague. Although Clark admitted that Syngman Rhee's troops were under his command, he did not explain whether the Syngman Rhee government and its army were included in the armistice, nor did he explain how they could be made to abide by the armistice agreement's terms.

Article 12 of the draft armistice agreement clearly stipulates: "The commanders of both belligerent sides order and ensure that all armed forces under their control, including all units and personnel of the army, navy, and air force, completely cease all hostile acts in Korea, and the complete cessation of these hostile acts shall take effect twelve hours after the signing of this armistice agreement." Article 17 further stipulates: "The commanders of both belligerent sides shall respectively take all necessary measures and methods within the armies under their command to ensure that all their subordinates thoroughly abide by all the provisions of this armistice agreement."

Because Clark did not explain in his reply how to take effective measures to ensure the implementation of these provisions in the event that Syngman Rhee insisted on sabotaging the armistice agreement, the U.S. chief representative Harrison had to answer these unanswered questions in the conference room. Unless the U.S. side gives a definite answer to this extremely important question for a complete ceasefire and a stable armistice, there will be a dangerous situation, that is, the Syngman Rhee government and its army can wantonly sabotage the armistice and re-launch armed aggression in Korea. The answer to this question will determine whether the U.S. government is sincere on the issue of an effective and stable armistice, or whether it intends to leave a big loophole in the armistice agreement to allow Syngman Rhee to continue the war.

The U.S. side has not taken any steps to retrieve the more than 27,000 prisoners of war detained by Syngman Rhee, and this conniving and irresponsible attitude is particularly serious and dangerous because Syngman Rhee intends to use force to obstruct the implementation of the armistice agreement. It is already known that Syngman Rhee is clamoring to carry out the following actions:

(1) If the armistice agreement is realized, his army will withdraw from the Allied Command and act alone. (2) Refuse to cease fire and refuse to withdraw from the military demarcation line to obstruct the establishment of a demilitarized zone. (3) Continue to "release" Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, detaining them to be used as cannon fodder for Syngman Rhee's puppet army or the Kuomintang army in Taiwan. (4) Use force to intimidate neutral representatives, Red Cross personnel, and staff members who are sent to implement the armistice agreement. (5) Re-launch armed aggression and use force rather than peaceful solutions to unify Korea.

All peace-loving people and countries who hope for an armistice in Korea have the right to know how United Nations Commander-in-Chief Clark intends to prevent the armistice agreement from being sabotaged in this way. During the past two years of negotiations, former chief representative Joye and current chief representative Harrison have repeatedly reiterated that they represent the "South Korean government" headed by Syngman Rhee. However, it is on this important question—what specific measures and methods to take to make the Syngman Rhee government and its army abide by the armistice terms—that Clark remains silent. Unless this question is answered definitively, the world has reason to suspect that the United Nations Commander-in-Chief intends to avoid implementing its terms even before the armistice agreement is signed.

    美国采取什么具体措施和办法使李承晚遵守停战协定
    克拉克对这个重要问题始终没有肯定答复
    【新华社开城十一日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：双方接连第二天在板门店举行秘密会议，讨论如何实施停战条款，由于李承晚的严重破坏战俘协议的行为，由于美方没有采取有效的步骤以防止他进一步破坏这个协议，签订停战协定的准备工作被耽误了三个星期以上。
    此间观察家们指出，联合国军总司令克拉克对保证执行停战协定条款这个问题的答复是含糊其词的。虽然克拉克承认李承晚的军队是归他指挥的，但是，他却没有说明李承晚政府及其军队是否包括在停战之内，也没有说明如何能使他们遵守停战协定条款。
    停战协定草案的第十二款明明白白规定：“敌对双方司令官命令并保证其控制下的一切武装力量，包括陆、海、空军的一切部队与人员，完全停止在朝鲜的一切敌对行为，此项敌对行为的完全停止自本停战协定签字后十二小时起生效。”第十七款又进一步规定：“敌对双方司令官须分别在其指挥下的军队中采取一切必要的措施与办法，以保证其所有部属彻底遵守本停战协定的全部规定。”
    因为克拉克在他的复信中没有说明在李承晚坚持要破坏停战协定的情况下如何采取有效措施来保证执行这些规定，美方首席代表哈利逊便不得不在会议室中答复这些没有答复的问题。除非美方在这个对完全停火和稳固停战极其重要的问题上提出肯定答复，否则就会产生一种危险的局势，这就是李承晚政府及其军队便可以恣意破坏停战，在朝鲜重新发动武装侵略。这个问题的答案将决定美国政府在有效和稳固停战问题上究竟是有诚意呢，还是它有意使停战协定留下一个大漏洞，让李承晚继续战争呢。
    美方没有采取任何步骤追回被李承晚扣留的二万七千名以上的战俘，这种纵容和不负责任的态度，由于李承晚打算利用武力来阻挠停战协定的实施，而显得特别严重和危险。大家已经知道，李承晚正在叫嚣要实行下列行动：
    （一）如果停战协定实现，他的军队便要退出联军司令部而单独干下去。（二）拒绝停火，也拒绝撤出军事分界线以阻挠非军事区的成立。（三）继续“释放”朝中战俘，扣留他们做李承晚傀儡军或台湾国民党军队炮灰。（四）使用武力恫吓被派来执行停战协定的中立国代表、红十字会人员和工作人员。（五）重新发动武装侵略，用武力而不是用和平解决方法来统一朝鲜。
    一切希望朝鲜停战的爱好和平的人民和国家都有权利要知道联合国军总司令克拉克打算怎样防止停战协定遭到这样破坏。在过去两年谈判期间，前任首席代表乔埃和现任首席代表哈利逊曾经一再重申，他们代表以李承晚为首的“韩国政府”。但是，正是在这个重要问题——采取什么具体措施和办法使李承晚政府及其军队遵守停战条款——上，克拉克却默不作声。除非这个问题得到一个肯定的答复，否则全世界就有理由怀疑，联合国军总司令甚至在停战协定签字以前就想避不执行它的条款了。
