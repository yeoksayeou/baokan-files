Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. As the United States attempts to intensify the rearmament of Japan through "Mutual Security Agency Aid," Japanese former militarists are stepping forward to establish organizations and openly engage in activities to revive Japanese militarism.

A group of Japanese former fascist career soldiers and Zaibatsu, who have been clamoring for rearmament and the revival of militarism under the slogan of "integrating democracy and national spirit" since last December, formally established an organization called the "Japan Patriotic League" on July 3rd. Kyodo News Agency said: "This is the second such group established within a month." On June 3rd, about 1,000 Japanese former soldiers, Zaibatsu, etc., established a "Japan Defense Association" specifically to promote rearmament and anti-communism.

The "Japan Patriotic League" will establish "Patriotic Clubs" among young people, women, and veterans throughout Japan, using means such as promoting martial arts and military sports to incite so-called "national defense spirit."

Kyodo News Agency said: "The Japan Patriotic League mainly originated from the remnants of the Japan Reservists Association, which was disbanded after the war, and is supported by business leaders who are wholeheartedly advocating the construction of defense capabilities." The chairman of the "Japan Patriotic League" is former Admiral Naokuni Nomura, who served as the Navy Minister in the wartime Tojo Cabinet, and the vice-chairmen are Chozō Sugimoto, the former leader of the Mitsui Zaibatsu, and Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome, among others. The advisors to this organization include: former Japanese Army Generals Kazushige Ugaki and Osamu Shimomura, war criminal Neiji Okamura, as well as Kōkichi Gōko, chairman of the "Defense Production Committee" of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, and Aiichirō Fujiyama, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and other representatives of the Zaibatsu.

    日本旧军国主义分子公开成立组织进行活动
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：正当美国在企图通过“共同安全署援助”来加紧重新武装日本的时候，日本旧军国主义分子纷纷出头露面成立组织，公开进行复活日本军国主义的活动。
    自从去年十二月以来就在“融合民主主义和民族精神”的口号下叫嚣重整军备和复活军国主义的一批日本旧法西斯职业军人和财阀，已在七月三日正式成立了一个名叫“日本爱乡联盟”的组织。共同社说：“这是在一个月之内成立的第二个这类的团体”。在六月三日，日本旧军人、财阀等约一千人曾成立了一个专门鼓吹重整军备和反共的“日本防卫协会”。
        “日本爱乡联盟”将在日本各地青年、妇女和退伍军人中建立“爱乡俱乐部”，以提倡武术和军事性的运动等手段来煽动所谓“国防精神”。
    共同社说：“日本爱乡联盟主要是从战后被解散的日本在乡军人会的残余分子中产生的，并且得到
    一心主张建设防卫力的企业界领袖的支持。”“日本爱乡联盟”的会长是曾任战时东条内阁海军大臣的海军大将野村直邦，副会长是前三井财阀的首领人物杉本长藏和前海军中将福留繁等人。这个组织的顾问包括：前日本陆军大将宇垣一成和下村定、侵华战犯冈村宁次以及日本经济团体联合会“防卫生产委员会”主席乡古洁和日本商工会议所主席藤山爱一郎等财阀代表人物。
