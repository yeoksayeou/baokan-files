Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th: In mid-July, our army on the Korean central front launched a powerful counterattack against the Syngman Rhee puppet army, which was sabotaging the Korean armistice and constantly provoking our forces, routing more than four divisions of the Rhee puppet army and annihilating over 26,000 enemy troops.

On the night of July 13, with the coordination of powerful artillery fire, our army on the central front launched a counterattack simultaneously from multiple directions against the defending enemy, the Rhee puppet army, on the bow-shaped front line extending more than 30 kilometers west of the Bukhan River, east of Kimhwa, and south of Kumhwa. This area was where Van Fleet launched his second major offensive in the autumn of 1951. After the battle began, with the support of powerful artillery fire, our forces broke through the enemy's front line in just 30 minutes to an hour. Our army then braved the heavy rain and launched a fierce pursuit, bypassing the positions held by the desperately resisting remnants of the enemy, and bypassing the roads blocked by tanks, artillery vehicles, jeeps, and trucks loaded with ammunition abandoned by the enemy, to encircle and pursue the fleeing remnants. The retreating enemy troops were extremely disheveled and in a state of extreme chaos.

By 2:00 PM on the 14th, the eastern and central route armies had completely occupied the enemy's positions north and east of the Kumseong River (a tributary of the Bukhan River), covering more than 100 square kilometers. The western route army had crossed Mount Wolbong, and the vanguard was advancing directly south of Mount Wolbong.

On the 15th, our army engaged in fierce positional battles with the enemy launching counterattacks, while continuing to advance south.

In the powerful counterattack, our army reduced the elite Capital Division, favored by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, to "cripples," routed more than three divisions of the defending enemy, including the 3rd, 6th, and 8th Divisions, and captured dozens of large and small mountain ridges, including the enemy's important positions of Mount Gyoyam, Mount Wolbong, and Mount Bonghwa. By the 16th, our army had completely controlled the 26-kilometer-wide area from Hagamryeong in the west to Deungdaeri and Yangji in the east, expanding the area of our positions by approximately 170 square kilometers. Our army's positions have advanced two to ten kilometers or more to the south.

According to preliminary statistics, by July 18, our army had killed, wounded, and captured a total of 26,089 enemy troops in the counterattack and positional battles on this front line. Our army captured 44 enemy tanks; 1 armored vehicle; 274 vehicles; 1 aircraft; 33 howitzers; 9 multiple rocket launchers; 41 chemical mortars; 47 recoilless guns; 48 rocket launchers; 69 other cannons; 423 various machine guns; 3,199 other guns; 15 flamethrowers; 377 important communication equipment items; and 30 ammunition depots. In addition, our army also destroyed and consumed a large amount of the enemy's weapons, equipment, and combat materials.

Currently, the battle for positions on the front line west of the Bukhan River and east of Kimhwa is still fiercely underway. Our soldiers are both fiercely annihilating the enemy launching counterattacks on the newly captured positions and actively building new positions, preparing to inflict even heavier blows on any enemy who blindly believes in force and clamors for war.

    朝鲜中线我军展开强大反击战
    歼灭敌军两万六千多名
    缴获敌坦克四十四辆，各种炮二百余门
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】七月中旬，朝鲜中线我军向破坏朝鲜停战，并不断向我军寻衅的李承晚伪军展开强大的反击战，击溃李伪军四个多师，歼灭敌军两万六千多名。
    七月十三日夜间，中线我军在强大炮火配合下分数路向北汉江以西、金化以东、金城以南三十多公里长的弓形战线上的守敌李伪军同时发起反击。这个地区是范佛里特在一九五一年秋季发动第二次重点进攻的地区。战斗发起后，各路我军在强大炮火支援下，仅仅经过三十分钟到一小时的战斗，即将敌军阵线全部突破。我军旋即冒着大雨展开猛烈的追歼战，越过还在作绝望抵抗的残敌据守的阵地，越过为敌人丢弃的坦克、炮车、吉普车和满载弹药的卡车所堵塞的公路，向前包围和追歼溃退的残敌。溃退的敌军异常狼狈，陷入极度的混乱状态。
    到十四日下午二时，东路和中路我军已完全攻占金城川（北汉江支流）以北和以东约共一百多平方公里的敌军阵地。西路我军已翻越月烽山，先锋部队直指月烽山正南前进。
    十五日，我军一面与前来反扑的敌人展开激烈的阵地争夺战，一面继续向南挺进。
    在强大的反击战中，我军已把美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮所宠爱的精锐首都师打成“残废”，击溃了守敌第三师、第六师、第八师等三个多师，攻占了敌重要阵地轿岩山、月烽山、烽火山等大小数十座山岭，至十六日为止，我军已完全控制了西起下甘岭，东至登大里、阳地一线二十六公里宽的地区，扩展阵地面积约一百七十平方公里。我军阵地已向南推进了二至十公里以上。
    据初步统计，到七月十八日止，我军已在这一线阵地的反击战和争夺战中，打死、打伤和俘掳敌军共两万六千零八十九名。我军缴获敌军坦克四十四辆；装甲车一辆；汽车二百七十四辆；飞机一架；榴弹炮三十三门；多管火箭炮九门；化学迫击炮四十一门；无后座力炮四十七门；火箭筒四十八门；其他炮六十九门；各种机枪四百二十三挺；其他枪三千一百九十九支；火焰喷射器十五具；重要通讯器材三百七十七件；弹药库三十座。此外，我军还击毁和消耗了敌军大量的武器装备和战斗器材。
    现在，北汉江以西、金化以东一线阵地上的争夺战仍在激烈地进行中。我军战士们一面在新攻占的阵地上痛歼前来反扑的敌人，一面积极修建新阵地，准备给任何迷信武力、叫嚣战争的敌人以更加沉重的打击。
