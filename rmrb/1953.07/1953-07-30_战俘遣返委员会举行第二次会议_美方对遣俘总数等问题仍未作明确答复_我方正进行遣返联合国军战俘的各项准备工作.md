Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 29th: The POW Repatriation Committee was established yesterday and has already held its second meeting. According to the agreement, both sides will hand over prisoners of war at Panmunjom; the repatriation of prisoners of war will begin on August 5th; the US side will repatriate 2,760 captured personnel (including 360 sick and wounded POWs) to our side every day, and 2,400 per day after the repatriation of the sick and wounded POWs is completed; our side will repatriate 400 POWs to the US side every day. The total number of POWs that our side will repatriate to the US side is 12,763, but the US side has not clearly stated the total number of captured personnel it will repatriate to our side. According to the materials provided by the opposing commander in a letter dated May 27, 1953, the total number of our captured personnel under US custody who should be directly repatriated is 76,000, but later the US side reduced the total number of our captured personnel who should be directly repatriated to 74,000. The US side has not yet accounted for this difference of 2,000 people. In addition, the US side has not yet responded to the question of how many prisoners of war have now been recovered from those so-called "released" by the Syngman Rhee clique.

According to the agreement between the two sides, prisoners of war held in US custody who are not directly repatriated will be moved to the southern edge of the demilitarized zone. In a statement issued by our negotiating representative on July 22nd, it was stated: "Among the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, in addition to the genuine prisoners of war whom your chief representative guarantees will no longer be so-called 'released,' any special agents dispatched by the Li-Jiang bandit gangs must not continue to masquerade as administrators, teachers, translators, and other positions in the POW camps, nor should they follow the POWs to the demilitarized zone." We have asked the other side to pay serious attention to this statement. Whether this issue can be resolved smoothly depends on how the US side handles it.

Currently, the Korean and Chinese sides are vigorously carrying out various preparations for the repatriation and reception of prisoners of war. A large number of military workers, bricklayers, carpenters, equipment installers, and railway workers from Korea and China are rushing to build various projects in Panmunjom, Kaesong, and other related areas. The two reception stations set up by the Korean and Chinese sides in Panmunjom have already identified the terrain and are about to start building roadbeds, constructing tents, and building new roads. The houses and tents set up in Kaesong for the POWs returning and being sent out are partly completed, and the interior is being tidied up, the walls, doors and windows are being decorated, and tables, chairs, and electric lights are being installed; some are still being rushed to build day and night. The health area used for receiving the sick and wounded captured personnel returning from repatriation last time has now been repainted and the equipment will be more complete and thorough than in the past. Various temporary hospitals prepared by our side to receive sick and wounded prisoners of war are setting up various medical facilities and repairing gardens. The staff are determined to make the environment very clean and fresh so that the returning sick and wounded captured personnel can recuperate happily here. Railways and highways used to transport the repatriated and received prisoners of war are also being vigorously constructed. A large number of clothing, food, nutrients, medicines, and various books, newspapers, magazines, cultural and entertainment equipment, etc. are being transported to Kaesong.

Xinhua News Agency, Bi Tong, July 29th: Preparations are underway here for the repatriation of UN Army prisoners of war.

Fast motorboats on the Yalu River and trucks on the highway are speeding from one barracks to another, transporting supplies for the prisoners of war who are about to be repatriated. Large quantities of flour, eggs, and white sugar are being continuously transported to each POW camp to be baked into bread and cakes for the prisoners of war to eat on their way to Panmunjom. Each prisoner of war can also receive four or five pounds of canned meat to eat during the repatriation trip. Each prisoner of war will also receive a new blanket, a pair of leather shoes, a pack of cigarettes, candy, and other items.

Large convoys of trucks and ambulances are about to arrive here. First aid stations are being set up along the road to Panmunjom.

Two schools and some other buildings have been renovated and will be used as offices and dormitories for the Joint Red Cross team established in accordance with the armistice agreement.

    战俘遣返委员会举行第二次会议
    美方对遣俘总数等问题仍未作明确答复
    我方正进行遣返联合国军战俘的各项准备工作
    【新华社开城二十九日电】战俘遣返委员会已于昨天成立，并已举行了第二次会议。根据协议，双方交接战俘地点都在板门店；战俘的遣返将于八月五日开始；美方每天遣交我方被俘人员二千七百六十人（内包括三百六十名伤病战俘），在伤病战俘遣交完毕后每天遣交两千四百人；我方每天遣交美方战俘四百人。我方将遣交美方的战俘总数是一万二千七百六十三名，但美方将遣交我方的被俘人员总数尚未明确交代。根据一九五三年五月二十七日对方司令官来信所提供的材料，在美方收容下的应予直接遣返的我方被俘人员总数是七万六千人，但是后来美方却把应予直接遣返的我方被俘人员总数减少至七万四千人。这两千名的差额美方迄今一直未作交代。此外，关于美方现在究竟已经追回多少被李承晚集团所谓“释放”的战俘的问题，美方也还没有答复。
    根据双方协议，在美方拘留中的不直接遣返的战俘将移至非军事区南缘。在七月二十二日我方谈判代表曾发表声明称：“在不直接遣返的战俘中，除你方首席代表保证不再予以所谓‘释放’的真正的战俘以外，凡是李蒋匪帮所派遣的特务不得继续在战俘营中混充管理员、教员、翻译及其他的职司和跟随战俘来到非军事区。”关于这个声明，我方曾提请对方严重注意。这个问题能否顺利解决，就要看美方如何处理了。
    现在朝中方面正大力进行遣返和迎接战俘的各种准备工作。朝鲜和中国的大批的军工、瓦工、木工、装置工和铁路工人等，正分别在板门店、开城和其他有关地区赶建各种工程。设在板门店的朝中方面两个接收站，已经看好地形，即将开始打路基、修建帐篷和修建新的道路等工作。设在开城的供接收回来及遣送出去的战俘们住用的房屋和帐篷，有的已经完工，现在正在整理内部，修饰墙壁门窗，安置桌凳、电灯；有的还在日夜赶修。在上次接待遣返归来的病伤被俘人员用的卫生区，现在又粉饰一新，设备也将比过去更完备，周到。我方准备接待病伤战俘用的各临时医院，正在设置各种医务设备和修葺园圃。工作人员都决心把环境布置得非常清洁新鲜，让归来的病伤被俘人员在这里愉快地疗养。为转运遣返出去和接收回来的战俘用的铁路和公路，也都在大力修筑。大量的衣物、食品、营养品、医药品和各种书报杂志、文化娱乐器具等正运来开城。
    【新华社碧潼二十九日电】这里已在进行遣返联合国军战俘的准备工作。
    鸭绿江上的快速汽艇和公路上的货车正在由一个营房到一个营房飞驰着，为即将遣返的战俘们运送供应品。大量的面粉、鸡蛋和白糖正在源源不断地运到每个战俘营，准备焙成面包和糕饼，给战俘们在到板门店去的路上食用。每个战俘还可以领到四五磅在遣返途中吃的罐头肉食。每个战俘并将领到一条新的毯子、一双皮鞋、一条香烟、糖果和其他物品。
    大队货车和救护车即将到达这里。急救站正在沿着到板门店的公路上设立起来。
    两所学校和一些别的建筑物已经装修过，它们将用来作为按照停战协定成立的联合红十字会小组的办公处和宿舍。
