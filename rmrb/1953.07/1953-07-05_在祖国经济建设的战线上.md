    On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland
    Forty-five factories and mines in Beijing have overfulfilled their June production plans
    Forty-five state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Beijing have overfulfilled their June production plans. Among them, the Shijingshan Power Plant, Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Jingxi Chengzi Coal Mine, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, People's Machine General Factory, Xinhua Printing Factory, People's Printing Factory, Business Branch of the People's Printing Factory, three factories under the Beijing Building Materials Company, and six factories under the Beijing Chemical Industry Company have all overfulfilled their production plans for the first half of the year. The situation of completing the production plans in other factories has also gradually improved. For example, the Beijing Brick and Tile Manufacturing Company had not completed the plan from January to May, but in June, 21 of the 26 factories under the company completed the plan.
    These factories and mines generally strengthened their planning management in the second quarter. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Construction of the Anshan Design Building begins
    The construction of the Anshan Design Building officially began on June 16. The entire building is scheduled to be completed on November 15 this year.
    This building is being constructed for the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ferrous Metallurgical Design Company. In the future, it will become the design base of China's ferrous metallurgical industry. The total height of the building is 43.6 meters, with a construction area of 15,600 square meters. The entire structure of the building has nine floors, with four floors built flat and the central tower section rising five floors, each with an area of 250 square meters.
    The design of this building was made by our country's designers under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. After the construction began, Soviet experts often went to the site to provide technical guidance. For example, the planned depth of the basement of the design building was 2.6 meters, but water began to seep out from all directions when only 1.7 or 1.8 meters were excavated. At this time, the experts proposed a method of digging drainage ditches, which solved this major problem. With the enthusiastic help and guidance of Soviet experts, all the staff at the construction site of the design building are full of confidence to complete this task well, quickly, and economically in all respects.

    The newly installed large generator of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau's No. 1 Power Plant is officially powered
    A large generator newly installed in the No. 1 Power Plant of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau was officially powered on "July 1st". At 9:45 a.m. on July 1, an electrical worker sitting in front of the control desk of the new generator calmly twisted the automatic paralleling switch after completing the various preparations before powering on. At this time, the electricity generated by the newly installed large generator immediately passed through the high-voltage grid extending in all directions, enabling factories and mines in areas spanning hundreds of miles to have more sufficient power to smelt iron and steel, manufacture cement, spin yarn and weave cloth, mine coal, and conduct resource exploration. The new large generator is operating well after it was officially powered on. The vibration amplitude of the turbine body is very small, all automatic meters and signals are very sensitive, and all equipment is fully up to specifications. The staff of the capital construction department of the No. 1 Power Plant of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau were all excited and proud that they could present this gift on "July 1st".

    Guangzhou Construction Engineering Company adopts the "prefabricated concrete floor slab" construction method
    The Guangzhou State-owned Construction Engineering Company has adopted the advanced Soviet "prefabricated concrete floor slab" construction method in the construction of a batch of mixed-structure two-story staff dormitory projects, which has shortened the construction time and saved building materials.
    The "prefabricated concrete floor slab" construction method is to prefabricate the floor slabs and lintel beams, and then install the floor slabs and lintel beams when the brick walls are built to the second floor. This is different from the previous construction method of first building brick walls, nailing floor panel molds, then tying floor steel bars and pouring concrete. In this construction site, the floor project of one dormitory took 14 days using the old method; while the floor of another dormitory used the advanced "prefabricated concrete floor slab" work method, which only took six days, shortening the construction time by eight days compared to the old method. In terms of materials, the originally designed floor slab thickness was more than 10 centimeters, but after adopting the new method, only 5 or 6 centimeters thick concrete floor slabs are needed. This time, the adoption of the advanced method of "prefabricated concrete floor slabs" for the construction of 11 dormitories saved a total of 6,127 kilograms of steel bars and 37,113 kilograms of cement.

    Another batch of workers' dormitories completed in Guangzhou
    Another batch of brand new workers' dormitories has been completed in Guangzhou, and their owners have successively moved into these new homes.
    The area of ​​these recently completed workers' dormitories is more than 106,000 square meters. There are 460 family dormitories, which can accommodate 4,034 households; and 15 single dormitories, which can accommodate 1,582 people, totaling more than 26,000 workers and their families.
    These workers' dormitories are distributed in the beautiful suburbs of Xicun, Huangsha, Fenghuanggang, and Nantoutou, with fresh air. Trees have now been planted around the dormitories, and some are building gardens.
    The workers of the Guangdong Paper Mill moved into their new homes successively at the end of April. The new homes are fully equipped with electricity, water, and kitchens. The workers were overjoyed. The old technician Mai Bo hung a portrait of Chairman Mao in the center as soon as he moved into the dormitory. He said: Without Chairman Mao, there would be no good life today! He expressed that he would work hard to improve production and create a happier life in the future. The administration and trade unions of other factories are now stepping up all preparations for the workers to move into the dormitories, and all of them can move into the new homes from the end of May to the middle of June.

    武汉冶电业局第一发电厂新装的大型发电机正式送电
    武汉冶电业局第一发电厂新安装好的一部大型发电机，已在“七一”正式送电。七月一日上午九时三刻，一个坐在新发电机控制桌前的电气工人，在做完送电前的各项准备工作后，就镇定地扭动了自动并车开关。这时，新装大型发电机发出的电力，立即通过伸向四面八方的高压线网，使纵横数百华里地区内的工厂、矿山立即有了更充分的动力去冶炼钢铁，制造水泥，纺纱织布，开采煤矿和进行资源勘探等工作。这部大型发电机正式送电后，运转情况良好。透平本体的震幅很小，所有自动表计和信号都十分灵敏，一切设备完全合乎规格。武汉冶电业局第一发电厂基本建设部门的职工，一致为他们自己能在“七一”呈出这份献礼而感到兴奋和自豪。（新华社）
    广州市建筑工程公司采用“预制混凝土楼板”施工法
    广州市国营建筑工程公司在承建一批混合结构的二层楼职工宿舍的工程中，采用苏联先进的“预制混凝土楼板”施工方法，缩短了施工时间，并节省了建筑材料。
    “预制混凝土楼板”施工方法，就是预先将楼板、阵梁做好，等砖墙砌到第二层楼时，就把楼板和阵梁安装上去。这和过去先砌好砖墙、钉好楼面板模、再扎楼面钢筋和浇灌混凝土的施工方法是不同的。这个工地中有一座宿舍的楼面工程用旧法施工，花了十四天时间；而另一座宿舍的楼面采用“预制混凝土楼板”的先进工作法，只花了六天时间，比旧法的施工时间缩短了八天。在材料方面，原设计的楼板厚度在十公分以上，采用新方法后，只要用五公分或六公分厚的混凝土楼板就可以了。这次采用“预制混凝土楼板”的先进方法施工的十一座宿舍，共节省了钢筋六千一百二十七公斤，水泥三万七千一百十三公斤。（新华社）
    广州又有一批工人宿舍落成
    广州市又有一批崭新的工人宿舍落成，它们的主人已经陆续搬进这些新居里去。
    最近完成的这批工人宿舍的面积有十万六千多平方公尺，家属宿舍共有四百六十幢，可住四千零三十四户；单身宿舍十五座，可住一千五百八十二人，总计可以解决工人和他们的家属共二万六千余人的住宿问题。
    这些工人宿舍分布在西村、黄沙、凤凰岗、南石头等环境优美的郊外，空气清新。宿舍周围，现已普遍植树，有的正在建设花园。
    广东造纸厂的工人已于四月底陆续搬进新居，新居的电灯、水道、厨房样样俱全，工人都欢天喜地，老技工麦波一搬进宿舍，首先就把毛主席像挂在正中央，他说：没有毛主席，那有今天的好生活！他表示今后要努力搞好生产，创造更幸福的生活。其余各厂的行政和工会现正加紧为工人迁进宿舍作一切准备工作，五月底至六月中，可全部搬进新居。
