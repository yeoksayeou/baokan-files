Li Rongxiang said: "The work will inevitably be very difficult, so I will start learning from scratch in the work." Yi Shanyou said: "My confidence is very high, not because I have learned well, but because I am determined to serve the people, and my confidence is built on the basis of humbly learning from everyone."
