    Letters from Readers in Fishing Areas Reflect Two Opinions of Fishermen in Production
    Editor's Note: The following excerpts from two letters reflect the demands and opinions of fishermen in production. Fishermen in Linghu, Wuxing County, request that cooperatives provide sufficient bait. Reader Zhou Yingtang raises an opinion on the practice of Yangjia Fishing Ground in Fuyu County, which disregards the development of the national aquatic industry and the long-term interests of fishermen by overfishing juvenile fish. These are worth paying attention to. The competent authorities mentioned in the letters should solve these problems immediately.
    More than 40,000 Fishermen in Linghu, Wuxing County
    Urgently Require Sufficient Supply of Bait
    Han Yanqing, Yu Jianxiong, and Min Naizhe of the Construction Section of the People's Government of Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, write: Our county has a very developed freshwater fish farming industry, which requires a large amount of bean cake and distiller's grains as bait. In 1952, the Linghu District Fisheries Production and Sales Cooperative alone supplied nearly 20,000 dan of bean cake to its members. This year, the county plans to increase fish fry cultivation by 50% compared to last year, requiring even more bait. According to calculations by the Linghu District Fisheries Production and Sales Cooperative, in addition to distiller's grains and other supplementary baits, the district needs at least 26,000 dan of bean cake. This figure was reported to the County Cooperative Union at the end of 1952. On March 31 this year, the Fisheries Cooperative received a notice from the County Union stating that due to the scarcity of bean cake sources, only 7,500 dan can be supplied this year. This figure is less than one-third of the required amount. When the Fisheries Cooperative contacted the Supply Section of the County Union, they said, "When the Provincial Union assigned tasks, it only allocated fertilizer, not bait; these 7,500 dan were allocated by the County Union out of consideration for you." To solve this problem, the Fisheries Cooperative reported the fish farming situation and the amount of bean cake needed this year to the relevant higher authorities on April 1 and 17, and requested assistance in solving the problem. As a result, the reply from the Shanghai Station of the Second Batch Management Bureau of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives said: "Bean cake has been allocated to provincial unions, and there is no supply at present." The Provincial Aquatic Bureau notified the County People's Government that "After the Provincial Union convened a supply meeting of various counties to study the matter, it is also difficult to solve the supply problem." This prevents a major problem in the production of our county's fishermen from being solved.
    Since 1951, the Provincial Aquatic Bureau and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have sent people several times to understand the fish farming production in our county, and they seem to attach great importance to fisheries production on the surface; but they always procrastinate and are irresponsible when it comes to supplying fish bait, and we have to go through a lot of trouble to solve the problem each time. Linghu in our county is one of the best freshwater fish farming lakes in the country, and more than 44,000 people depend on it for their livelihood. The higher authorities are not unaware of the important significance of fish farming production in our county, so why didn't the Provincial Cooperative Union consider the supply figures for fish bait when allocating the supply quota for bean cake this year? In April of this year, our County People's Government also requested assistance from the Provincial People's Government, the Provincial Financial and Economic Commission, and the Provincial Aquatic Bureau, but only received an irrelevant reply from the Provincial Aquatic Bureau. In March of this year, the Provincial Aquatic Conference called for vigorous development of freshwater aquaculture and required our county to guarantee the completion of fish fry production tasks. Now our county's fish fry procurement task has been basically completed (and will be overfulfilled), but the bait supply has not been resolved, which will cause significant losses in production and seriously affect next year's stocking tasks. We believe that the relevant leading organs in our province only call for vigorous development of fisheries production, but are irresponsible in solving the specific difficulties existing in fisheries production, which is very wrong. We demand that the fish bait problem be solved quickly, so as to avoid serious losses to fisheries production.
    Yangjia Fishing Ground in Fuyu County, Jilin Province
    Large-Scale Fishing of Juvenile Fish Affects Fish Reproduction
    Zhou Yingtang of the Zili Village Fishermen Committee in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, writes: Yangjia Fishing Ground in Fuyu County, Jilin Province, caught more than 400,000 jin of fish in the whole year of 1952, of which more than 300,000 jin were juvenile fish. The small fish that were released in March and April this year were again caught by the fishing ground for more than 40,000 jin. The responsible cadres of the fishing ground not only did not stop this practice, but instead adopted a supportive attitude. This method of netting all fish, large and small, will gradually reduce the number of fish, seriously damage the long-term interests of fishermen and the national aquatic resources. I think: the fishing ground should be inspected, this practice should be corrected, and in the future, it should earnestly attach importance to the reproduction and protection of fish.

### 渔区读者来信反映渔民在生产中的两个意见

专栏：读者来信摘要

    渔区读者来信反映渔民在生产中的两个意见
    编者按：下面摘要发表的两封来信中，读者反映了渔民在生产中的要求和意见。吴兴县菱湖渔民要求合作社充分供应饵料。读者周英堂对扶余县杨家渔场不顾国家水产事业的发展和渔民长远利益，而滥捕幼鱼的做法提出意见。这些都是值得重视的。来信中所提到的主管机关应即解决这些问题。
    吴兴县菱湖四万多渔民
    迫切要求充分供应饵料
    浙江省吴兴县人民政府建设科韩延庆、余剑雄、闵乃喆来信：我县淡水养鱼事业很发达，需要大批豆饼及酒糟等作饵料。一九五二年单菱湖区渔业产销合作社供应社员的豆饼即将近二万市担。今年全县计划养殖鱼苗较去年增加百分之五十，所需饵料更多。经菱湖区渔业产销合作社计算，除酒糟等副饵品外，该区至少需要豆饼两万六千市担。这个数字在一九五二年年底就上报给县合作社联合社。今年三月三十一日，渔业合作社接到县社的通知说：豆饼因来源稀少，今年只能供七千五百市担。这个数字不足需要量的三分之一。渔业合作社与县社供应科联系时，他们说：“省社分配任务时，只拨给肥料，没有饵料；这七千五百担是县社照顾你们，才拨给的。”为了解决这个问题，渔业合作社在四月一日及十七日先后把殖鱼情况及今年豆饼需要量报告有关上级机关，并要求协助解决这个问题。结果，全国合作总社供应业务第二批发管理局上海站的答覆说：“豆饼已分配给各省社，目前无货供应。”省水产局通知县人民政府说：“省社召开各县供应会议研究后，亦难以解决供应问题。”这就使我县渔民生产中的重大问题得不到解决。
    自一九五一年以来，本省水产局及合作总社曾几次派人了解我县养鱼生产情况，他们在表面上似乎很重视渔业生产；但在供应鱼饵时总是推拖不负责任，每次都要我们费许多周折才获得解决。我县菱湖是全国淡水养鱼优良湖之一，依此为生者达四万四千多人。我县养鱼生产的重要意义，上级机关不是不了解，那末省合作总社为什么在今年分配豆饼供应额时没有考虑鱼饵供应数字？今年四月份我县人民政府也曾分别要求省人民政府、省财经委员会及省水产局要求协助解决这一问题，但只得到省水产局一个不关痛痒的答覆。今年三月份全省水产会议号召大力发展淡水养殖，要求我县保证完成鱼苗生产任务。现在我县的鱼苗采购任务已基本上完成了（并将超额完成），但饵料供应未得解决，将使生产受到重大损失，并严重影响明年放养任务。我们认为，我省有关领导机关只号召大力发展渔业生产，对渔业生产中存在的具体困难却不负责解决，这是很不对的。我们要求赶快解决鱼饵问题，以免使渔业生产受到严重损失。
    吉林省扶余县杨家渔场
    大量捕捞幼鱼影响鱼类繁殖
    黑龙江省肇源县自立村渔民委员会周英堂来信：吉林省扶余县杨家渔场在一九五二年全年捕鱼四十多万斤，其中有三十余万斤是幼鱼。今年三、四月中才放出来的小鱼，该场又捞捕了四万余斤。该场负责干部对这种做法不但不加制止，反而采取支持态度。这种大鱼，小鱼一网捞净的办法，将使鱼类逐渐减少，严重地损害了渔民长远的利益和国家水产资源。我认为：该渔场应进行检查，纠正这种做法，今后切实重视鱼类的繁殖保护工作。
