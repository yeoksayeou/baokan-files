Message of Respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers

To Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    On the occasion of celebrating the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, we, on behalf of all the Chinese people, extend our highest respects and heartfelt greetings to you and all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a major victory for the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world in defending peace and opposing aggression. This victory should first of all be attributed to the heroic struggle of you and the Korean People's Army. The people of the motherland will forever thank you for your immortal achievements in defending the motherland and defending peace.

    The current task of the Chinese people is to consolidate the victories already won and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The Chinese people guarantee to continue to work hard and serve as your and the Korean people's backing.
