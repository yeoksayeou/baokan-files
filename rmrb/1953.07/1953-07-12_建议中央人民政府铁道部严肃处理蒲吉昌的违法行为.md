Letters from readers Xu Wa and Si Jiang: The Second Engineering Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways dispatched cadre Pu Jichang to Qingping Township, Mianzhu County, Sichuan last July to organize local farmers to cut timber for the construction of the Tiancheng Railway. Local farmers knew that the completion of the railway would bring them great benefits and eagerly signed up to participate. However, the wage standards set by the bureau were very unreasonable. For example, it was stipulated that for timber felled with a length of 10 meters and a diameter of 18 centimeters or more, the wage would be 5,000 yuan regardless of the size; below this standard, the wage would be 2,500 yuan. Farmers in the fifth village of the township spent more than ten workdays felling a large tree with a diameter of more than 60 centimeters, and the wage was still 5,000 yuan, averaging less than 500 yuan per workday. Regardless of the size of each piece of timber, the transportation cost was 500 yuan per li (approximately 500 meters). The large tree mentioned above took more than 70 people three days to transport to the riverbank 15 li away, and the wage was only 7,500 yuan, averaging only 35 yuan per person per day. Under normal circumstances, the income of farmers transporting timber was less than 600 yuan per day, which was not enough to maintain their lives. Pu Jichang, who was responsible for this work, also frequently deducted farmers' wages, describing large timber as small timber; and refused to pay farmers' wages for salvaging timber from the river (according to regulations, the wage for salvaging a piece of timber blocked by a cliff stone from the river was five sheng of rice). The farmers proposed: As long as they had two meals of corn flour a day and straw shoes to wear, they would rather not receive wages. But Pu Jichang ignored them; although the Construction Section of the Mianzhu County People's Government was aware of these situations, it did not try to solve them.

    Pu Jichang was indifferent to the safety of the farmers' lives. He often forced farmers to go into the water in the severe winter to salvage timber blocked by cliff stones. Many farmers became ill or injured as a result. When farmer Yan Jiaxing was injured by a stone while being forced to salvage timber in the river, Pu Jichang saw it but said heartlessly: "Who told him not to pay attention, no one cares if he dies." Pu Jichang also arbitrarily destroyed farmers' crops in the work of felling and transporting timber. When the timber was released from the mountain, it damaged a large amount of crops planted by farmers on the mountainside. Afterwards, Pu Jichang only gave the farmers a small amount of compensation, and some were not compensated at all. This caused serious difficulties for the production and life of many farmers.

    Under these circumstances, the farmers were unwilling to participate in the work of felling and transporting timber, and they all asked to go home. Fearing that he would not be able to complete the timber felling task, Pu Jichang convened a mass meeting in Qingping Township, using words such as "Anyone who does not cut timber is a bad element and will be sent to the Public Security Bureau" to intimidate the farmers; and "instructed" the township head to organize all the labor force in the township to cut timber, and if male laborers were not at home, women should replace them. Under Pu Jichang's coercive orders, the timber felling work was completed by February this year, but the prestige of the People's Government had been damaged, and the local farmers had suffered serious losses.

    We suggest that the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government conduct a serious and thorough investigation of this matter as soon as possible, seriously deal with Pu Jichang's illegal and undisciplined behavior, and appropriately compensate the local farmers for their losses.

### 建议中央人民政府铁道部严肃处理蒲吉昌的违法行为

    建议中央人民政府铁道部严肃处理蒲吉昌的违法行为
    读者许娃、思江来信：中央铁道部第二工程局曾在去年七月派遣干部蒲吉昌到四川绵竹县清平乡组织当地农民伐木，以供修建天成铁路的需要。当地农民知道铁路修成后将给他们带来很大利益，纷纷报名参加。但是该局规定的工资标准很不合理。如规定所伐木材在长十公尺、直径十八公分以上的，不管多大，工资一律为五千元；在这标准以下，工资一律为二千五百元。该乡五村农民花了十多个工才砍倒一根直径六十多公分的大树，工资仍然为五千元，平均一个工得不到五百元。每根料木不论大小，运费都是一里路五百元。像上面提到的那根大树，七十多人花三天时间才能运到十五里外的河边；而工资只有七千五百元，平均每人每日所得只有三十五元。在一般情况下，搬运木料的农民每天收入不到六百元，根本不够维持生活。负责这一工作的蒲吉昌还经常克扣农民工资，把大木料说成小木料；并拒绝偿付农民下河捞取木料的工资（按照规定，从河里捞上一根被崖石挡住的木材，工资为五升米）。农民提出：每天只要有两顿玉麦面吃，有草鞋穿，宁愿不领工资。但蒲吉昌并不理会；绵竹县人民政府建设科虽然了解这些情况，也不设法解决。
    蒲吉昌对农民的生命安全是漠不关心的。他经常强迫农民在严寒的冬天下水捞取被崖石挡住的木料。很多农民因此害病或受伤。农民言加兴被迫下河捞取木料时被石头砸伤，蒲吉昌看到了，却毫无心肝地说：“谁叫他自己不注意，死了也没人管。”蒲吉昌在伐运木材工作中还任意破坏农民的庄稼。木材从山上放下来，大量地损坏了农民在半山种的庄稼，事后蒲吉昌只给农民很少量的赔偿，有的就根本不赔。这就使不少农民的生产和生活遭到严重困难。
    在这种情况下，农民们都不愿参加伐运木材的工作，纷纷要求回家。蒲吉昌怕完不成伐木任务，就在清平乡召集群众大会，以“谁不去伐木就是坏分子，一律送公安局”等话来恐吓农民；并“指示”该乡乡长必须把全乡的劳动力都组织起来伐木，男劳动力不在家就要妇女代替。在蒲吉昌的强迫命令下，伐木工作到今年二月是完成了，但人民政府的威信已经受到损害，当地农民受到了严重的损失。
    我们建议中央铁道部对这件事迅速进行认真检查，严肃处理蒲吉昌的违法乱纪行为，并适当补偿当地农民的损失。
