Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 30th: The French National Conference for Peace Negotiations concluded on the 28th. Representatives from all social strata and political parties spoke at the conference, demonstrating the desire of all French people for a peaceful end to the existing wars and for the resolution of all disputed international issues through consultation.

    The conference unanimously passed a resolution on the Indochina issue. The resolution emphasized that stopping the war against the Vietnamese people has become a "recognized national need" for France. The resolution stated: "Any form of conflict, if it takes on an international character, will increase the burden on France and will cause a real danger of the outbreak of a world war. For the honor, interests, and future of our motherland, we must conduct a national struggle to stop the war and demand negotiations."

    The conference also passed a resolution on the German issue. The resolution stated: Due to the actions of the people of all countries, especially the French people, the Bonn and Paris Treaties, although signed more than a year ago, have not been ratified to this day. The people of all countries still need to finally abolish these treaties and conduct consultations in order to reach an agreement on resolving the German issue in order to promote universal security and peace. Germany must be unified under democratic principles, and the resurgence of militarism, Nazism, and the spirit of revenge and conquest must be prevented. The National Conference for Peace Negotiations calls on the French people to be more vigilant and make greater efforts to extinguish the sparks that may cause a prairie fire.

    The conference also passed an open letter to the French people. The open letter stated: The French people are paying a heavy price every day for the "Cold War" and the Indochina War. The French people hope that their government will take the initiative on the issue of peaceful consultation. The French people should stop the Indochina War, reject the Paris and Bonn Treaties, and peacefully resolve the German issue. France can take effective measures to convene a four-power conference and make the United Nations a tool for governments to reach agreements and disarm. France must establish trade relations with all countries in order to promote common prosperity.

    法国争取和平谈判全国会议闭幕
    通过决议要求停止对越南人民的战争
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国争取和平谈判全国会议在二十八日闭幕。在这次会议中，各社会阶层和政治党派的代表都发了言，表明法国全体人民要求和平结束现有战争，要求通过协商解决所有争执的国际问题。
    会议一致通过了关于印度支那问题的决议。决议强调指出：停止对越南人民的战争已经成为法国“公认的全国需要”。决议说：“任何形式的冲突如果带上国际性质，就会加重法国的负担，并且会引起世界战争爆发的实际危险。为了我们祖国的荣誉、利益和前途，我们必须进行一个全国规模的斗争，争取停止战争，要求进行协商。”
    会议也通过了关于德国问题的决议。决议说：由于各国人民尤其是法国人民的行动，波恩和巴黎条约虽然签订了一年多，但是到今天还没有得到批准。各国人民还需要最后废除这些条约，进行协商，以便为促进普遍安全与和平而获致解决德国问题的协议。德国必须在民主的原则下统一起来，必须防止军国主义、纳粹主义和复仇与征服精神的再起。争取和平谈判全国会议号召法国人民加倍警惕，以更大的努力去扑灭可能引起燎原的星火。
    会议也通过了告法国人民书。告法国人民书说：法国人民每天都为“冷战”和印度支那战争付出重大代价。法国人民希望他们的政府在和平协商问题上表现主动。法国人民应该使印度支那战争停下来，使巴黎和波恩条约遭到拒绝，使德国问题得到和平解决。法国可以采取有效措施，以便召开四国会议，并且使联合国成为各国政府取得协议和裁减军备的工具。法国必须和所有国家建立贸易关系，以便促进共同的繁荣。
