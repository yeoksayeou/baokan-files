    Zhutun Township, Yucheng County, Shandong Province: Heavy Workload Hinders Production
    Zhutun Township in Yucheng County, Shandong Province, is a key point township for the CPC Dezhou Prefectural Committee of Shandong. The township has a total of eight villages. There are often 20 cadres working in this township, including the Prefectural Committee's work team and county, district, and township cadres, with two or three cadres in each village. During the spring plowing and production, the township's various tasks took a step forward, playing a certain role in creating experience to guide the work of other townships. However, because the cadres of the work team did not completely overcome the ideas of demanding too much and being eager for quick success, an abnormal phenomenon of many cadres, much intervention, many tasks, and many meetings was formed. For various tasks, the cadres of the work team only studied them themselves and then went to the villages to "implement" them separately, rarely or never going through the village organizations. Various township committees could not play their role; even the meetings convened by the townships and villages were personally presided over by the cadres of the work team. As a result, the village cadres developed a reliance on the work team. Township head Song Gongchen said: "In the past, I could grasp the overall work situation of the township. Since the work team came, they have grasped the situation. I only report to them after doing the work, and I rely on them for everything. My own work is passive, and now the township cadres cannot grasp the overall situation."
    This township is also a pilot township for the general election in this special district. In order to "cooperate" with the election work, supplementary lessons on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were conducted in villages where the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was incomplete. In the current busy farming season, villages also have to comprehensively rectify and restore village organizations such as farmers' associations, women's associations, and militia. Coupled with voter registration and other work, all the cadres are busy attending meetings every day, and for many days they do not even have time to study. During this period, in order to deal with the arrested counter-revolutionaries, mass rallies were organized in the daytime in Guo Village and Zhang Hanyang Village for accusations; later, a meeting of more than 100 activists from the entire township was convened for accusations. Rallies were held during the day, and small group discussions were held in the evening. The current situation in this township is: township meetings have decreased (because each village has stationed cadres), village meetings have increased; mass rallies have decreased, and meetings of village cadres and activists have increased. The work team has been in this township for nearly two months, holding meetings in each village every night; sometimes during the day as well as at night; and even cadres holding several meetings separately in one night. They do not prepare well before the meeting, and the meeting drags on for a long time, generally lasting until eleven or twelve o'clock every night. For example, on May 23rd, the village cadre meeting (six people) presided over by Comrade Zhao Ling of the Prefectural Committee work team in Zhutun Village lasted all night in order to solve the ideological problems of the cadres; some went to work at dawn, and some went to sleep. Village cadres and activists were exhausted, unable to produce, had low morale, and were very dissatisfied with the work team. Township head Comrade Song Gongchen said: "Since the work team came to this township, township cadres who are not separated from production are used like district cadres. Every morning, they are gathered to study and research work, and after noon, they go to the villages to work separately and hold meetings in the evening. How can they have time to participate in production? They only participate in production for three or four days a month, and there is no labor at home. This year, there is no substitute farming, so we have to spend money to hire people, and it is difficult to find people, which delays production. If we produce less grain, how can our family live?" Cheng Yijie, secretary of the Party branch of Zhutun Village, said: "In the past, village cadres held meetings only every three or four nights; since the work team came, mass meetings have decreased, but meetings of village cadres and activists have increased. In the past month or so, I have attended meetings every night. At this time, the nights are short, and after working hard all day, I am tired. Once the meeting starts, it lasts until midnight. I can't sleep at night, and I can't get up in the morning, so I don't have any energy to work." Based on the above situation, it is very important to continue to change the work style of the leading cadres of the key point work. (Dong Guanlong)

    山东禹城朱屯乡工作任务繁重妨碍生产
    山东禹城朱屯乡是中共山东德州地委的基点乡。全乡共八个村。经常在这个乡工作的干部有地委工作组和县、区、乡干部共二十人，每村都有两三名干部。在春耕生产中，这个乡的各种工作都先进一步，对创造经验指导其他乡的工作起了一定的作用。但由于工作组的干部没有完全克服要求过高、急于求成的思想，所以形成了干部多、包办多、任务多、会议多的不正常现象。对于各种工作，工作组的几个干部只是自己研究一下，就分头到各村去“贯彻”，很少或者根本不通过乡村组织。乡级各种委员会不能发挥作用；甚至连乡村所召开的会议都是工作组干部亲自主持的。因此，乡村干部产生了对工作组的依靠思想。乡长宋功臣说：“过去我还能掌握全乡的工作情况，自从工作组来了，他们把情况掌握住了，我做了工作只向他们汇报一下就算完事了，有事都依靠他们，自己工作被动，全面情况现在乡干部是掌握不起来了。”
    这个乡又是这个专区的普选试验乡。为了“配合”选举工作，又在镇压反革命工作不彻底的村进行了镇压反革命工作的补课。各村在目前农忙季节又要普遍整顿、恢复村的农会、妇会、民兵等组织。再加上选民登记等工作，全体干部每天都忙于开会，很多天连学习的时间也没有了。就在这期间，为了处理被捕的反革命分子，曾在白天组织了郭庄、张汉杨庄两个村的群众开大会进行控诉；后来又召开了全乡百余人的积极分子会议进行控诉。白天开大会，晚上还开小会讨论。现在这乡的情况是：乡的会议减少了（因每村都有驻村干部），村的会议增多了；群众大会减少了，乡村干部积极分子的会议增多了。工作组到这乡近两个月了，每天晚上在各村召开会议；有时候白天也开，晚上也开；甚至干部分头一晚上开几个会。开会前又不作好准备，开起来时间拖得很长，每天晚上一般都开到十一点到十二点。如朱屯村五月二十三日由地委工作组赵岭同志主持的村干部会议（六人），为了解决干部思想问题，竟开了一通夜；到天明有的去做活，有的去睡觉。乡村干部和积极分子精疲力竭，不能生产，工作情绪不高，对工作组非常不满。乡长宋功臣同志说：“自从工作组到这乡后，拿着不脱离生产的乡干部和区干部一样使用，每天上午集中学习研究工作，过午分头到各村工作，晚上开会，那有时间参加生产？每月参加生产的时间只有三、四天，家庭又没劳力，今年又不代耕，用人就得花钱，人又不好找，耽误了生产，少打了粮食，一家人怎么过呢？”朱屯村党支部书记程义杰同志说：“过去村干部隔三、四晚上才开一次会；自从工作组来了，群众会是减少了，但是村干部和积极分子的会加多了。这一个多月的时间，我每天晚上都参加会议。这时候夜又短，干一天活又累，一开就开到半夜，夜里不能睡觉，早晨起不来，干起活来混身没力气。”根据以上情况看来，继续转变基点工作领导干部的作风是非常重要的。（董观龙）
