Xinhua News Agency, July 10th dispatch from Paris: A report from the "Pravda" correspondent in Paris, Lasa Jin, states: The new French government, headed by Laniel, faces severe financial difficulties as soon as it takes office. The most serious problem it faces, the same problem that the previous government failed to solve, is: where to raise money to continue the devastating war in Indochina and to carry out the expansion of armaments that has seriously affected the French economy.

Lasa Jin writes: According to recent French newspaper materials, the total expenditure in the French budget amounts to 3,808 billion francs, while revenue is much lower than this figure. The current budget deficit amounts to as much as 825 billion francs. Inflation is getting more and more serious. The franc, which has already been devalued five times in the post-war period, is now rumored to be devalued again. Lasa Jin points out that even bourgeois politicians have to admit that France is burdened with military expenditures that it cannot afford – accounting for more than 40 percent of the budget. These expenditures are related to France's membership in the Atlantic Group and are caused by the destructive war against the people of Indochina, which has been going on for several years. But when it comes to overcoming these financial difficulties, those French bourgeois politicians who acknowledge the evils of militarization propose various "saving" plans to reduce civilian spending and demand a further attack on the living standards of the working people. Democratic newspapers in Paris point out that in order to improve France's financial situation, the expansion of armaments and economic militarization cannot be continued. Only by returning to a peaceful economy can France escape from its economic and financial predicament.

Xinhua News Agency, July 11th dispatch from Paris: Newspaper reports indicate that France's financial situation is continuing to deteriorate. In the past week alone, the amount of paper money in circulation increased by 93.607 billion francs, totaling 2,147.953 billion francs. Parisian democrats point out that the National Assembly's approval of the new agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of France will further exacerbate inflation and harm the country's finances. This agreement allows the Ministry of Finance to overdraw 110 billion francs in advances, while the government has not yet repaid the previous two advances totaling 130 billion francs.

The General Confederation of Civil Servants (belonging to the General Confederation of Labor) issued a communique stating that most of the 3,800 billion francs in the national budget is used for military purposes, and there is a budget deficit of 800 billion francs in the current fiscal year. In this regard, the communique pointed out: "In this way, with the intensification of inflation, the devaluation of currency, and the rise in prices that cause poverty, the financial crisis is getting more and more serious. No artificial measures, no temporary decisions can hide the tragic situation of our country's finances."

    继续奉行侵略和扩军政策
    法国新政府财政困难
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎八日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者拉萨金报道：以拉尼埃为首的法国新政府刚一上台，便面临着严重的财政困难。它面前最严重的问题，也就是前任政府所未能解决的同一问题，这就是：从甚么地方筹钱来继续毁灭性的印度支那战争，来进行给法国经济造成严重后果的扩张军备运动。
    拉萨金写道：根据最近法国报纸的材料，法国预算中的支出总数达三万八千零八十亿法郎，而收入却比这个数字低得多。目前预算的赤字共达八千二百五十亿法郎之多。通货膨胀的情况越来越严重。在战后期间已经贬值五次的法郎，现在又谣传还可能贬值。拉萨金指出：甚至连资产阶级的政客也不得不承认法国背着它无力负担的军事开支的重担——占预算的百分之四十强。这些开支是与法国加入大西洋集团有关的，并且是迄今已经进行了数年之久的反对印度支那人民的毁灭性的战争所造成的。但是临到要克服这种财政困难的时候，那些承认军国主义化的恶果的法国资产阶级政客，却提出各种缩减民用开支的“节约”计划，并要求向劳动人民的生活水平发动进一步进攻。巴黎民主报纸指出：要改善法国的财政情况，便不能继续扩张军备运动和经济军事化。只有回到和平经济，才能使法国脱离经济与财政困境。
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎十日讯：报纸消息说明，法国财政情况还在继续恶化。单在上周，流通的纸币数额就增加了九百三十六亿零七百万法郎，共达二万一千四百七十九亿五千三百万法郎，巴黎民主人士指出，国民议会批准财政部和法兰西银行之间的新协定一举将进一步加剧通货膨胀，并有损于全国的财政，这个协定允许财政部透支一千一百亿法郎的垫款，而政府迄今尚未清偿以前两次共达一千三百亿法郎的垫款。
    公务员总工会（属于总工会）发表的公报说，在三万八千亿法郎的国家预算中，大部分是用于军事方面的，在本会计年度，有八千亿法郎的预算赤字。公报在这方面指出：“这样，随着通货膨胀的加剧、货币的贬值和造成贫困的物价的上涨，财政危机越来越严重了。任何人为的措施、任何临时的决定都不能掩饰我国财政的悲惨局面。”
