Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 11th: TASS Moscow, July 11th—The Minsk Oblast Committee and the Minsk City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Belorussian Republic, together with Party activists from Minsk City and Minsk Oblast, held a joint plenary session on the 10th. The meeting heard and discussed a report by Patolichev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belorussia, summarizing the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. A total of 1,300 people attended. Patolichev and all those who spoke in the discussion pointed out that the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is of great significance in the lives of the Communist Party and all the Soviet people, and it has received the broadest support and endorsement in our country.

    Kulchitskaya, a lathe operator at the Minsk Automobile Factory, said at the plenary session: Several thousand workers, engineering technicians, and staff in our factory unanimously denounced the traitor and agent of international capital, Beria. All the staff of the automobile factory expressed their loyalty to the Party and the government with their practical actions. We have victoriously completed the first half-year plan. In these days, we are increasingly and extensively launching a socialist competition to strive for the early completion of the annual plan. I am a lathe operator, and I often complete 180 to 200 percent of the plan every month, and all are high-quality products. There are hundreds of workers in our factory who have achieved such accomplishments. Our Party can be confident that the working class was, is, and always will be a loyal and strong fighter striving for the victory of communism in our country!

    Trushkevich, Chairman of the advanced "Soviet Belorussia" collective farm in Minsk Oblast, expressed the thoughts and feelings of the collective farmers in his speech. He said: We collective farmers will contribute all our strength to complete the tasks stipulated by the Party in agriculture. We will carry out the harvest in an exemplary manner and fulfill our obligations to the state in response to the decision of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Lubinovich, Vice-President of the Belorussian Academy of Sciences, and writer P. Kovalev pointed out that Russian scientists and cultural workers from Moscow and other cities in the Russian Federation have provided and continue to provide enormous help to Belorussia in developing the socialist content and national form of Belorussian culture. Lubinovich said: The traitor Beria attempted to create disputes between Belorussian intellectuals and Russian intellectuals. This has not succeeded in the slightest, and it will never succeed!

    Those who spoke in the discussion endorsed the decision of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, exposed the shortcomings in the work of the Party, Soviet, and economic organs, and put forward specific suggestions for eliminating these shortcomings. Among them, they pointed out the backwardness of agriculture in some areas of the state, and the fact that Minsk's housing and cultural and welfare construction plans had not been completed. The plenary session discussed some serious shortcomings in the work of ideological education institutions and shortcomings in the methods of propagating Marxist-Leninist theory.

    Mazur, Secretary of the Minsk Oblast Party Committee, Tarasov, Director of the Minsk Tractor Factory, Abrassimov, Vice-Chairman of the Belorussian Council of Ministers, Kiselev, Minister of Culture of Belorussia, Avkhimovich and Gorbunov, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belorussia, Kozher, President of the Republican Party School, and some others expressed the need to further strengthen the indestructible friendship between the Belorussian people and the great Russian people and other ethnic groups of the Soviet Union. They called on Communist Party members to strive to educate the Soviet people in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and to wage an irreconcilable struggle against all forms of bourgeois nationalism.

    The joint plenary session demonstrated the unity of the Minsk Oblast and Minsk City Party organizations and the maturity of the leading cadres. The joint plenary session adopted a resolution unanimously endorsing the timely and resolute measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to liquidate the anti-Party and anti-state crimes of Beria, the enemy of the Party and the Soviet people, considering them to be the only correct measures.

The plenary session also formulated specific measures for the Minsk Oblast and Minsk City Party organizations to implement the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
