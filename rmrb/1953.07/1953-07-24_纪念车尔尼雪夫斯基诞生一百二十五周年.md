    Commemorating the 125th Anniversary of Chernyshevsky's Birth
    By M. Zuozhiliang, Deputy Director of the Department of Linguistics, Moscow State University, USSR
    The Russian people are proud of Chernyshevsky, the great revolutionary, the brilliant thinker, and the artist of language.
    Chernyshevsky's life was the achievement of a revolutionary and a scientist. He was born in 1828 in the town of Saratov, the son of a priest. His diaries from his youth reveal insightful thoughts, a thirst for knowledge, and a love for labor. While Chernyshevsky studied various issues of social life, philosophy, history, literature, and art, he thought of "promoting mankind forward in its view of life," which meant transforming life on a new social foundation. During his studies at the University of St. Petersburg (1846-1850), Chernyshevsky's revolutionary democratic views and materialist worldview took shape. In his diary of 1848, he noted the idea that a republic is the best form of government. Considering the essence of the Western bourgeois revolutions and bourgeois democracy, Chernyshevsky suspected its class nature and criticized the activists of the bourgeois revolutions, "They talk about freedom, freedom... but they do not want to eliminate the social order that enslaves and proletarianizes nine-tenths of the people; the problem is not here... but in social relations, in not allowing one class to suck the blood of another"
    ("Complete Works of Chernyshevsky," Volume 1, page 111). This is the thought of a fully mature socialist, the thought of an observer who deeply understands historical events. The revolutionary storms in the West convinced Chernyshevsky of the possibility of changing the social system through revolutionary methods. In his diary of 1850, he longed for the rapid arrival of the Russian revolution: "This is how I think about Russia: I cannot help but long for the revolution that is about to come and thirst for it." ("Chernyshevsky's Diary," January 20, 1850)
    Chernyshevsky participated in the construction of the underground revolutionary organization "Land and Freedom," and wrote the leaflet "To the Peasants," in which he called on the people to overthrow the Tsarist regime and the oppression of the landlords.
    Chernyshevsky began to publish articles in the magazine "Notes of the Fatherland," and soon transferred to "The Contemporary," the combat organ of Russian revolutionary democracy, where he was in charge of the criticism and political commentary column. He became the widely recognized ideological leader of the Russian magazine. The articles he published in "The Contemporary" led the social opinion of the advanced forces of Russian society and guided the activities of the best Russian writers and fighters for freedom. The Tsarist government believed that Chernyshevsky's activities endangered the landlord dictatorship system. The cowardly and cruel government of Alexander II exiled Chernyshevsky to Siberia. At that time, Engels called Chernyshevsky an outstanding thinker... "Russia should be infinitely grateful to Chernyshevsky, who is living a life of chronic suicide in long-term exile among the Yakuts in Siberia, becoming a shameful stain on the life of 'Liberator' Alexander II." (Correspondence between Marx and Engels and Russian Politicians, page 286)
    The cruel persecution of the Tsarist executioners could not destroy Chernyshevsky's revolutionary spirit and will.
    From 1864 to 1883, Chernyshevsky lived in exile in Siberia, which damaged his health. The rescue attempts of Russian revolutionaries, especially Lopatin, for Chernyshevsky were not successful. These rescue activities were watched and sympathized with by Marx. In 1883, Chernyshevsky returned from exile, but only six years later, in 1889, the great revolutionary died. Chernyshevsky maintained a firm revolutionary faith throughout his life. The revolutionary achievements of Chernyshevsky and his works had a significant impact on the new generation of Russian revolutionaries.
    The multifaceted nature of Chernyshevsky's scientific, literary, and social interests surpassed many of his contemporaries in Russia and the West. He was very close to scientific socialism. His remarks on many issues related to economics and politics, art and literature, are in line with the ideas of Marx and Engels, who gave him the evaluation of the greatest Russian scientist and social activist. The classic writers of Marxism recognized the historical significance of Chernyshevsky in the development of Russian and world social thought. In a letter written in Geneva to the members of the Russian branch committee, Marx said: "Works like those of your teacher Chernyshevsky have created Russia's true glory and prove that you are also beginning to participate in the universal movement of our century." (Correspondence between Marx and Engels and Russian Politicians, page 39)
    When analyzing the political situation in Russia in the 1860s, Marx and Engels considered Chernyshevsky to be the leader of the revolutionary party. In a letter to Papritz, Engels emphasized that the selfless exploration of true theory in the Russian social thought world is what the people who produced Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky should have, when talking about the superiority of Russian social and political thought over the formal science of Germany and France. One of Marx's motivations for studying the Russian language was the hope of reading the original works of Chernyshevsky. In the postscript to the second edition of "Capital" (1873), Marx said that Chernyshevsky was a great Russian scholar and critic who made an outstanding explanation of the bankruptcy of bourgeois political economy.
    Lenin loved and admired Chernyshevsky. He evaluated Chernyshevsky as a political leader and revolutionary. Lenin wrote:
    "The spirit of class struggle blows from his complete works,... despite his ideas of utopian socialism, he is still an outstanding and profound critic of capitalism" ("Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 20, page 224).
    Lenin emphasized Chernyshevsky's revolutionary propaganda activities; pointing out his ability to "influence all political events of his time with a revolutionary spirit, and develop—through the heavy obstacles of censorship—the idea of peasant revolution, the idea of the masses of the people fighting to overthrow all old regimes" ("Complete Works of Lenin" Volume 17, page 97).
    Lenin pointed out that Chernyshevsky's philosophical viewpoint was the viewpoint of later materialism. Lenin wrote in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism": "Chernyshevsky is the only truly great Russian writer who stood at the level of complete philosophical materialism from the 1850s until 1888, and rejected the miserable nonsense of Neo-Kantians, positivists, Machists, and other confused people. However, due to the backwardness of Russian life, Chernyshevsky could not, or rather, could not develop to the dialectical materialism of Marx and Engels" ("Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 14, page 346). Chernyshevsky had that broad philosophical generalization ability and was good at connecting the ideas of utopian socialism with the program of revolutionary democracy. He rejected philosophy that was detached from class life and class struggle. Chernyshevsky saw the close connection between philosophical viewpoints and the social life and class interests of various strata. He was not limited to criticizing reactionary ideas; he also strived to completely change the existing social system on which reactionary ideas relied. All of this enabled Chernyshevsky to raise Russian philosophical thought in the mid-nineteenth century to the highest philosophical stage before the era of Marxism.
    Chernyshevsky has made significant contributions to the development of the materialist tradition in Russian philosophy. In the era when idealism dominated, Chernyshevsky consistently promoted the materialist theory of philosophy. His outstanding philosophical works: "The Aesthetic Relation of Art to Reality," "The Anthropological Principle in Philosophy," "The Gogol Period of Russian Literature," and many other works can illustrate this point.
    To understand Chernyshevsky's philosophical exploration and the intense labor he experienced in the revolutionary theory research of the liberation movement, one can study Lenin's famous saying about the exploration of the correct revolutionary theory—Marxism—by the advanced Russian thinkers from the 1840s to the 1890s: "Russia suffered half a century of suffering and disaster, unprecedented revolutionary heroism, extraordinary energy, and selfless exploration to obtain Marxism..." ("Complete Works of Lenin," Volume 31, page 9).
    The philosopher Chernyshevsky pointed out the great significance of practice as a means of verifying any theory. He wrote: "Practice is not only the practical aspect, but also the great revealer of deception and self-deception in the emotional and ideological aspects" ("Complete Works of Chernyshevsky," Volume 10, Part 2, page 174). Chernyshevsky elsewhere referred to practice as the touchstone of various theories.
    Chernyshevsky determined the party spirit of philosophy. He wrote:
    "Every philosopher is a representative of a certain party in society that is fighting for dominance at that time. Schelling is a representative of the party that was frightened by the revolution... Hegel is a moderate liberal, very conservative in many views... Their philosophical system runs through the spirit of those parties to which the author belongs" ("Complete Works of Chernyshevsky," Volume 6, page 180).
    Chernyshevsky subordinated practical revolutionary transformation to philosophical purposes, and the outstanding achievement of his philosophical thought lies in this. He rejected abstract, pedantic philosophical theories, and he asserted: "Abstract truth does not exist, truth is concrete" ("Complete Works of Chernyshevsky," Volume 2, page 187).
    Chernyshevsky used the principles of philosophical materialism to solve aesthetic problems. In this regard, he left some famous European theorists far behind him and was very close to Marx's theory of art. His dissertation "The Aesthetic Relation of Art to Reality"
    (1853-1855) is an outstanding philosophical work, in which the theory of realistic art is put forward. In this work, the important principles of realistic art are formed. If, in the eyes of Hegel and the famous European bourgeois art theorists, the main thing in art is the concept, then in Chernyshevsky's eyes, the main thing is life. He asserted that reality precedes works of art, and he dealt a fatal blow to Hegel's idealistic aesthetics. Hegel believed that art is only one of the manifestations of "absolute idea."
    Chernyshevsky's materialist aesthetics armed the advanced Russian and foreign writers with a revolutionary program of democratic art, and his aesthetics helped the struggle against the decadent ideas of bourgeois art and the theory of "pure art." Chernyshevsky required artists to raise and solve major social issues in their works. Chernyshevsky, in his artistic practice as a writer, set an example of this attitude towards art. According to Chernyshevsky, the essence and task of art is to reproduce life and explain life. He wrote: "Works of art often have... the significance of judging life phenomena." ("Complete Works of Chernyshevsky," Volume 10, Part 2, page 164)
    Chernyshevsky was also an outstanding artist and the author of many outstanding works, which formed an era in the development of Russian literature at that time. He wrote the novel "What Is to Be Done?" while in prison (1862-1863). This novel is a unique work in the world of literature. In this novel, the true image of new characters, revolutionary fighters, is presented for the first time (for example, the outstanding image of the revolutionary Rakhmetov). It involves the issue of exciting social struggle and puts forward the ideal of a new socialist system. The author of this novel portrays the images of these new characters with deep sympathy, and determines their new socialist morality and ethics, their persistence in struggle, and their intention to advance towards the goal. When we read this novel, we feel that everyone in it is brave, unwavering, unyielding, and not discouraged. Once they take on a cause, they can firmly grasp it and not let it slip from their hands, and everyone is upright to an impeccable degree.
    Chernyshevsky's novel cultivated many revolutionary activists in the Russian and international liberation movements. Plekhanov wrote: "This is why from the time the printing press appeared in Russia until today, no work in Russia has been as successful as 'What Is to Be Done?'"
    ("Complete Works of Plekhanov," Volume 5, pages 114-115) Dimitrov also praised this novel when talking about its influence on him becoming a proletarian revolutionary. Dimitrov wrote: "Our modern youth can not only gain great pleasure from reading this novel, but also gain real benefits in their revolutionary education."
    The novel "Prologue," written in exile, is another literary work by Chernyshevsky. The image of Volgin in this novel reflects some of Chernyshevsky's own characteristics. He expressed the beliefs of revolutionary democracy and his views on the most acute political issue—the "liberation" of Russian peasants—through Volgin's mouth. This novel exposed the hypocrisy of bourgeois liberals and serf owners, and contrasted them with the fascinating images of revolutionaries Volgin, Sokolovsky, and Levitsky. Chernyshevsky's innovative spirit in literary works that express great revolutionary ideas is evident here.
    Chernyshevsky's ardent patriotism, "and the will to strive for the glory and happiness of mankind in a country that is not temporary but eternal" inspired his multifaceted activities. Chernyshevsky's patriotism is incompatible with narrow nationalism, chauvinism, racism, and various harmful prejudices that he exposed and criticized.
    Based on the historical experience of mankind, Chernyshevsky convincingly revealed the inevitable demise of those who attempt to dominate the world. His reasoning on this issue is relevant in an era when the reactionary groups of capitalist countries are igniting war hysteria, threatening with weapons, and weaving contemptible conspiracies of provocation against the Soviet Union and the entire peaceful democratic camp. Chernyshevsky wrote: "It is always the case that a nation that wants to enslave mankind will also harm itself, and a class that sacrifices the entire people for itself will also lead itself to a dead end." ("Complete Works of Chernyshevsky," Volume 6, page 184)
    Chernyshevsky placed great hope in the future of his homeland and people. When talking about the future of the Russian people, he wrote: "How enviable our future is when the people overthrow the shackles of the Tsar, landlords, and capitalists, and create a new social system without oppression and exploitation." He fantasized about this system, for which he was exiled and for which he dedicated his beautiful life worthy of emulation. This great Russian thinker, outstanding revolutionary, and excellent artist fought for the ideals of socialism in the era of dark autocracy with courageous protest and firm confidence. The Soviet people piously maintain the glorious memory of him. (Translated by Liu Jing)

    纪念车尔尼雪夫斯基诞生一百二十五周年
    苏联国立莫斯科大学语言学系副主任  姆·佐竹梁
    俄罗斯人民是把伟大的革命家、天才的思想家和语言的艺术家车尔尼雪夫斯基引以自豪的。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基的生活就是革命者和科学家的功业。他于一八二八年生在萨拉托夫镇一个牧师的家里。他的少年时代的日记中就显现了精辟透彻的思想，对知识的渴慕以及对劳动的热爱。当车尔尼雪夫斯基研究社会生活、哲学、历史、文学和艺术的各种问题的时候，他想到“在对生活看法上推动人类前进”，这句话就是说要在新的社会基础上改造生活。在彼得堡大学求学时代（一八四六年——一八五○年），车尔尼雪夫斯基的革命民主的观点和唯物主义的世界观就形成了。他在一八四八年的日记里记着关于共和国是管理的最好方式的思想。车尔尼雪夫斯基考虑到西方资产阶级革命和资产阶级民主的本质，猜想到它的阶级性，并批评了资产阶级革命的活动家们，“他们谈论着自由，自由……他们却并不要消灭那个使十分之九的人民都沦为奴隶和无产者的社会秩序，问题不是在此；……而在社会关系，在不让一个阶级吮吸另一个阶级的血”
    （“车尔尼雪夫斯基全集”，第一卷，第一一一页）。这是一个完全成熟的社会主义者的思想，是一个深刻了解历史事件的观察家的思想。西方的革命风暴，使车尔尼雪夫斯基相信以革命方法改变社会制度的可能性。他在一八五○年的日记里想念过迅速来到的俄国革命：“这就是我对俄国的思想方式：情不自禁地巴望着快要到来的革命并渴想着这革命。”（“车尔尼雪夫斯基日记”，一八五○年一月二十日记）
    车尔尼雪夫斯基参加过地下的革命组织“大地和意志”的建设工作，写过“告农民书”的传单，他在传单里号召人民去推翻沙皇政权和地主的压迫。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基开始在“祖国纪事”杂志上发表文章，不久就转到俄国革命民主的战斗机关刊物——“现代人”，他在这个杂志中主持批评与政论一栏。他成为众望所归的俄国杂志的思想领导者。他在“现代人”上所发表的文章，领导了俄国社会先进力量的社会舆论，指导了最优秀的俄国作家和自由运动战士的活动。沙皇政府认为车尔尼雪夫斯基的活动危害了地主专政制度。胆小的和残酷的亚历山大第二的政府，把车尔尼雪夫斯基放逐到西伯利亚去。当时恩格斯把车尔尼雪夫斯基称作卓越的思想家……“俄国应当无限地感激车尔尼雪夫斯基，他在西伯利亚雅库特人之间过着长期放逐的慢性自杀生活，成为‘解放者’亚历山大第二的一生中一个羞耻的污点。”（马克思与恩格斯与俄国政治家的通讯，第二百八十六页）
    沙皇刽子手的残酷的迫害不能摧毁车尔尼雪夫斯基的革命精神和意志。
    从一八六四年到一八八三年车尔尼雪夫斯基一直是在西伯利亚过着放逐的生活，这种生活损害了他的健康。俄国革命家们，特别是拉帕金对车尔尼雪夫斯基的营救都没有成功。这些营救活动是受过马克思注视和同情的。一八八三年，车尔尼雪夫斯基才从流放中回来，但只经过六年，到一八八九年这位伟大的革命家就死了。车尔尼雪夫斯基一生抱着坚定的革命信心。车尔尼雪夫斯基及其作品的革命功绩，给予新一代的俄国革命家以重大的影响。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基的科学、文学和社会的兴趣的多面性，超过了俄国和西方的许多同时代人。他十分接近科学的社会主义。他的那些有关经济和政治、艺术和文学的许多问题的言论，是同马克思和恩格斯的思想相符合的，马克思和恩格斯曾经给他以最伟大的俄国科学家和社会活动家的评价。马克思主义的经典作家们承认车尔尼雪夫斯基发展俄国和世界社会思想的历史意义。马克思在日内瓦写给俄国分部委员会委员们的信中说：“像你们的导师车尔尼雪夫斯基这样的作品，造成了俄国的真正的光荣，证明你们也开始参加我们世纪的普遍的运动。”（马克思和恩格斯与俄国政治家的通讯，第三十九页）
    马克思和恩格斯在分析俄国六十年代的政治情况时，认为车尔尼雪夫斯基是革命政党的首领。在给帕普里茨的信中，恩格斯谈到俄国社会政治思想优越于德国和法国的形式科学时，着重指出，俄国社会思想界在真实理论方面的忘我探讨的精神，是产生了杜勃罗留波夫和车尔尼雪夫斯基的人民所应有的。马克思研究俄国语言的动机之一就在希望读到车尔尼雪夫斯基的卓越作品的原著。马克思在“资本论”第二版（一八七三年）的跋中，说车尔尼雪夫斯基是就资产阶级政治经济的破产作出出色说明的俄国伟大学者和批评家。
    列宁热爱并崇敬着车尔尼雪夫斯基。他把车尔尼雪夫斯基评价为政治领袖和革命家。列宁写道：
    “从他的全集里吹来阶级斗争的精神，……尽管他有着乌托邦社会主义的思想，但仍是一个对资本主义的卓越的、深刻的批评家”（“列宁全集”第二十卷，第二百二十四页）。
    列宁着重指出车尔尼雪夫斯基的革命宣传的活动；指出他善于“以革命的精神来影响他那时代的
    一切政治事件，发挥——经过书报检查的重重障碍——农民革命的思想，人民大众争取推翻一切旧政权而斗争的思想”（“列宁全集”第十七卷，第九十七页）。
    列宁指出，车尔尼雪夫斯基的哲学观点就是后来的唯物主义的观点。列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”一书中写道：“车尔尼雪夫斯基是唯一的真正伟大的俄国著作家，他从五十年代起直到一八八八年始终站在完整的哲学唯物论底水平上，摈弃新康德主义者、实证论者、马赫主义者、以及其他糊涂虫底可怜的废话。但是，由于俄国生活的落后，车尔尼雪夫斯基不能够，更正确地说，不可能发展到马克思和恩格斯的辩证唯物论”（“列宁全集”第十四卷，第三百四十六页）。车尔尼雪夫斯基具有那种广阔的哲学概括能力，善于把空想社会主义的思想和革命的民主主义的纲领联系起来。他摈弃了脱离阶级生活和阶级斗争的哲学。车尔尼雪夫斯基看到了哲学观点和各阶层的社会生活与阶级利益的密切联系。他并不以批判反动思想为限，他还努力于彻底改变反动思想赖以表现的现社会制度。所有这些，使车尔尼雪夫斯基把十九世纪中叶的俄国哲学思想提到马克思主义时代以前最高的哲学阶段。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基在发展俄国哲学中唯物论的传统方面有着重大的功绩。在唯心论称霸的年代，车尔尼雪夫斯基始终不渝地宣传哲学的唯物主义的理论。他的卓越的哲学作品：“艺术对现实的美学关系”、“哲学中的人类学的原则”、“俄国文学的果戈理时代”及其他许多作品，都可以说明这一点。
    要了解车尔尼雪夫斯基在哲学方面所做的探讨工夫，他在解放运动的革命理论研究方面所经历的那种紧张的劳动，可以研究一下列宁关于十九世纪四十年代到九十年代的先进的俄国思想家探究正确的革命理论——马克思主义情况的名言：“俄国遭受了半个世纪的苦难和灾害、空前未有的革命的英雄主义、非凡的精力和奋不顾身的探索而探得了马克思主义……。”（“列宁全集”第三十一卷，第九页）
    哲学家车尔尼雪夫斯基指出实践作为证实任何理论的手段的重大意义。他写道：“实践不只是实际方面，而且也是感情和思想方面的欺骗和自欺的伟大的揭露者”（“车尔尼雪夫斯基全集”第十卷，第二部，第一百七十四页）。车尔尼雪夫斯基在别处把实践称为各种理论的试金石。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基确定了哲学的党性。他写道：
    “每一个哲学家都是当时社会上为争取优势而战的某一政党的代表者。谢林是被革命吓昏了的政党的代表者……黑格尔是温和的自由主义者，在许多观点上都是很保守的……他们的哲学体系贯穿着作者所属的那些政党的精神”（“车尔尼雪夫斯基全集”，第六卷，第一百八十页）。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基使实际的革命改造服从于哲学的目的，他的哲学思想的卓越功绩就在于此。他摈弃了抽象的烦琐哲学理论，他断言说：“抽象的真理并不存在，真理是具体的”（“车尔尼雪夫斯基全集”，第二卷，第一百八十七页）。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基用哲学的唯物主义的原则解决美学的问题。在这一方面，他使欧洲的一些著名理论家远远落在他的后面，而和马克思的艺术理论十分接近。他的学位论文“艺术对现实的美学关系”
    （一八五三年——一八五五年），就是卓越的哲学著作，在这一著作中，提出了现实主义的艺术理论。在这一著作中，形成了现实主义艺术的重要原则。如果在黑格尔和著名的欧洲资产阶级的艺术理论家看来，艺术中主要的是观念，那么在车尔尼雪夫斯基看来，主要的就是生活。他断言说现实先于艺术作品，他给予黑格尔的唯心论的美学以致命的打击。黑格尔认为艺术只是“绝对观念”的表现之一。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基的唯物主义的美学，以民主的艺术的革命纲领把先进的俄国的和外国的作家武装起来，他的美学帮助着对资产阶级艺术的堕落思想、“纯艺术”之类的理论的斗争。车尔尼雪夫斯基要求着艺术家在自己的作品中提出和解决重大的社会问题。车尔尼雪夫斯基，在作为作家的他的艺术的实践中，树立了这么一种对待艺术的榜样。据车尔尼雪夫斯基所说，艺术的本质和它的任务在于重现生活、说明生活。他写道：“艺术作品也常常具有……对生活现象的判断的意义。”（“车尔尼雪夫斯基全集”，第十卷，第二部，第一百六十四页）
    车尔尼雪夫斯基也是卓越的艺术家，他是许多卓越作品的作者，这些作品当时在俄国文学的发展中形成了一个时代。他在坐监的时候写成小说“做什么？”（一八六二年——一八六三年）这部小说是全世界文学中绝无仅有的作品。在这部小说中，首次提出了新人物，革命的战士的真正的形象（例如，革命者拉赫米托夫的卓越的形象），它涉及使人激动的社会斗争的问题，提出对新的社会主义制度的理想。这部小说的作者以深厚同情心描写了这些新人物的形象，确定了他们的新社会主义的道德和伦理，他们在斗争中的坚持性和向着目标猛进的意向。我们读了这部小说，会感到其中每一个人都是勇敢的，不动摇，不退却，不气馁，一旦把事业担负起来，就能够牢牢地抓住它，不使它从手中溜走，每一个人又都正直到无可责难的程度。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基的小说培养了许多俄国和国际自由运动的革命活动家。普列汉诺夫写道：“这就是为什么从俄国出现印刷机起直到今天，在俄国没有任何一本作品能像‘做什么？’这样的成功。”
    （“普列汉诺夫全集”，第五卷，第一百一十四页——一百一十五页）季米特洛夫在谈到这部小说影响到他成为一个无产阶级革命者的时候，也同样赞扬过这部小说。季米特洛夫写道：“我们现代的青年读了这部小说，不仅可以获得很大的愉快，而且在自己的革命教育方面也可以获得真正的益处。”
    在流放中写成的小说“序幕”是车尔尼雪夫斯基的另一部文学作品。这部小说中的人物沃尔根的形象中反映出车尔尼雪夫斯基本身的一些特点。他借沃尔根的嘴表现出了革命民主的信念和对最尖锐的政治问题——俄国农民“解放”问题的观点。这部小说揭露了资产阶级自由主义者和农奴主的虚伪性，把革命者沃尔根、索科洛夫斯基、列维茨基的令人神往的形象和他们对照起来。车尔尼雪夫斯基在表现着伟大的革命思想的文学作品中的革新精神，就显现在这里。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基的火热的爱国主义精神，“和争取并非暂时的而是永远的祖国的光荣和人类的幸福”的意志鼓舞着他那多方面的活动。车尔尼雪夫斯基的爱国主义是与狭隘的民族主义、沙文主义、种族主义以及他所揭露所抨击的各种有害的成见不相容的。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基根据人类的历史经验，使人信服地揭示了妄图统治全世界者不可避免的灭亡。他对这个问题的推论，当资本主义各国家的反动集团正在燃起战争歇斯底里、用武器作威胁、编织反对苏联和全和平民主阵营的可鄙的挑拨阴谋之网的时代，是具有现实性的。车尔尼雪夫斯基写道：“永远是这样的：一个民族要使人类沦为奴隶，也就要损害自己，一个阶层要为自己而使全体人民遭受牺牲，也就会把自己引到一个绝路。”（“车尔尼雪夫斯基全集”，第六卷，第一百八十四页）
    车尔尼雪夫斯基把很大的希望寄托于祖国人民的未来。他谈到俄国人民的前途时写道：“当人民推翻了沙皇、地主和资本家的桎梏，并创造了没有压榨和剥削的新的社会制度的时候，我们的未来是多么令人羡慕啊。”他幻想过这种制度，他为此而被放逐，为此而献出了他的值得仿效的美丽的生命。这一位俄国伟大的思想家、卓越的革命家和优秀的艺术家是在黑暗专制政体的年代里，以勇敢的抗议和坚定的信心为社会主义的理想而进行过战斗的，苏联人民虔诚地保持着对于他的光辉的记忆。（刘竞译）
