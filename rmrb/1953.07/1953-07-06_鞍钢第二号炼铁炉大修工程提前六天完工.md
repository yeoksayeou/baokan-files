Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 4th: The overhaul of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Blast Furnace was completed on June 30th, six days ahead of schedule. The furnace construction quality meets Soviet standards. No. 2 Blast Furnace is the largest blast furnace ever overhauled in our country. During the Japanese imperialist occupation, overhauling such a blast furnace would take at least half a year; this time, it only took thirty-four days. This will enable the blast furnace to produce thousands of tons more pig iron for the country.

　　In the overhaul project of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Blast Furnace, Soviet experts' suggestions were conscientiously implemented, and mechanized construction was adopted in the main projects. In the past, the refractory bricks needed for furnace repair were mostly carried to the blast furnace by workers climbing wooden frames. Now, these tasks have been replaced by steel rope conveyors. Slurry, oxygen, and other furnace building materials needed for maintenance are also sent to the furnace top, furnace waist, and other work areas using slurry pumps and other conveying equipment. More than a dozen winches and "vertical lifts" surround the blast furnace, lifting and transporting various major accessories for it. After installing "mobile hanging platforms" on the furnace top and furnace waist, the workers砌砖(qi zhuan -laying bricks) at high altitude can rise or fall as needed for the bricklaying operation, as safe and convenient as working on the ground. In the maintenance project, the workers displayed a high degree of enthusiasm. In the past, bricklayers could only lay 80 bricks per person in eight hours, but now they can lay more than 360. The work efficiency of the welders working on the scrubbing tower has also doubled. The grinding wheel brick grinding machine modified by worker Lu Xingluo grinds the plane and edges of each brick flat and qualified; the work efficiency has increased from 30 bricks chiseled in eight hours to 385, ensuring the needs of mechanized construction. Furnace construction worker Ji Weichun and others, after a long period of research and experimentation, created the "elastic slurry dipping frame," making a significant contribution to the furnace construction project. In the past, bricklaying was done with a trowel to spread the slurry, and no matter how carefully the workers operated, the slurry was always applied unevenly, affecting the service life of the blast furnace. Now the elastic slurry dipping frame replaces the trowel. When workers operate it, they dip it in the slurry like a stamp, and then gently press it on the brick, and a thin layer of slurry will adhere to the brick. In this way, not only is it guaranteed that the slurry is evenly thick, and the gaps between the furnace building bricks reach the Soviet standard of 0.5 mm, but also the life of the blast furnace can be greatly extended.

    鞍钢第二号炼铁炉大修工程提前六天完工
    【新华社鞍山四日电】鞍山钢铁公司大修第二号炼铁炉的工程，已于六月三十日提前六天完工。筑炉质量达到了苏联标准。第二号炼铁炉是我国历年来大修的高炉中最大的一个。在日本帝国主义统治时期，大修这样的炼铁炉，至少需要半年时间；而这次大修，只花费了三十四天。这样，就能使炼铁炉为国家多生产千百吨的生铁。
    鞍山钢铁公司在大修第二号炼铁炉的工程中，认真执行苏联专家建议，在主要工程中采用了机械化施工。过去修炉需用的耐火砖，大多是由工人攀登着木架背往高炉。现在这些工作，已由钢绳输送机代替了。检修中需要的泥浆、氧气等筑炉材料，也是用泥浆泵等输送器具送上炉顶、炉腰等工区。十几台卷扬机和“立吊”，环绕在炼铁炉四周，为它起重和吊运着各种重大配件。炉顶、炉腰装置了“活动吊盘”后，在高空砌砖的工人，就可以随着砌砖操作的需要上升或下降，和地面上工作一样的安全和方便。在检修工程中，工人们发挥了高度的积极性。瓦工们过去每人八小时只能砌八十块砖，现在达到了三百六十多块。在洗涤塔上工作的电焊工，工作效率也比过去提高了一倍。工人卢兴禄改造的砂轮磨砖机，把每块砖的平面和楞角都磨得平整合格；工作效率由过去一班八小时凿三十块提高到了三百八十五块，保证了机械化施工的需要。筑炉工人纪维纯等经过长时间的研究试验，创造了“弹力沾浆架”，对筑炉工程作了重大贡献。过去砌砖都是用瓦刀抹泥浆，工人在操作时无论怎样精心，泥浆总是抹得薄厚不均，影响炼铁炉的使用年限。现在弹力沾浆架代替了瓦刀。工人操作时，像打戳印一样用它在泥浆里一沾，而后在砖上轻轻一按，一层薄薄的泥浆，就会沾在砖上。这样，不但保证了泥浆薄厚均匀，筑炉砖的空隙达到零点五粍的苏联标准，还能使炼铁炉的寿命大大延长。
