    I Realized My Mistake in Violating Labor Discipline
    Wang Xiuzhen
    I am a cigarette packaging worker at the Hengda Tobacco Factory. I started working in the factory at the age of fourteen and have been there for over eight years. Since liberation, our workers' lives have been getting better day by day. We eat rice and white flour every day, and whatever fresh vegetables are in season. We no longer have to worry about food and drink like we did before liberation. I thought to myself: it is truly liberation, the workers have turned over a new leaf. Being a worker, reaching this point is the peak, what are we waiting for if we don't enjoy ourselves now? I especially love watching Ping Opera now. I never used to care for it at all, but now that we are liberated and workers can enjoy opera, shouldn't I watch more? I know what new plays are being staged at the opera house. After work, I call to reserve a ticket, and the next day I find an excuse to take a break and go see the opera. One day last year, I woke up and saw that it was drizzling. The road was difficult to walk, and I thought: I won't go to work. Deducting a day's wages is only ten or twenty thousand yuan, what does it matter! Good or bad production doesn't depend on a day or half a day! I went back to bed and covered myself with the blanket. When I woke up, the sun was shining, and it was already past ten o'clock, so I went to the factory to ask for leave. I lied and said my mother was sick. The comrades in the group were very concerned and said, "Hurry up and ask for leave to get your mother treated!" I thought to myself: What's the rush, there's nothing wrong at all. But on the surface, I pretended to be worried. I went to the leaders and told them, and they told me to follow the procedures for asking for leave in the future. This made me cry. I thought: I'm asking for leave and getting less wages myself, why are you being so fussy! After getting the leave, I didn't go home, I first went to visit a friend, and in the afternoon, I went to see a Ping Opera.

    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, you wouldn't get paid for sick leave, and they might even fire you. Now the government is taking care of the workers and implementing labor insurance regulations, so you don't lose much money for sick leave. Therefore, whenever I felt unhappy or had a headache or fever, I would go to the doctor to "mooch" for leave. My illness, you could say it was an illness, and you could say it wasn't. The doctor gave me medicine, but I didn't take it. He told me to rest, but I felt bored, so I went to watch movies and listen to Ping Opera. Some comrades in the group advised me, saying that taking frequent leave would make it impossible to complete the plan. I listened and hummed and hawed on the surface, but in my heart, I thought: Isn't the labor insurance regulation for the workers to enjoy? One day of rest is one day of rest, what plans are there to worry about. Before liberation, workers didn't dare to take sick leave. Now the government is taking care of us, shouldn't I relax and take a breath!

    Our factory's broadcasting station plays Ping Opera and Bangzi Opera every day at four o'clock in the afternoon. I often listen to opera, so I know what is being sung and who is singing it. I tell everyone what it is about. I can even imagine how they act on stage for every line they sing. I report to everyone what I saw after work, face to face, talking for a long time, and not caring about work. Sometimes, if the opera isn't played at four o'clock, I get upset and call the foreman to ask him to call the broadcasting station. If anyone advises me not to make a fuss and hinder production, I argue with them. I say: I want to do this, what's it to you! This isn't before liberation, when workers didn't even dare to say a word! If people ignored me, I would throw cigarette boxes and take my anger out on the tools. When I'm in a good mood, I package two thousand cigarettes, but when I'm in a bad mood, I only package thirteen or fourteen hundred. And I would pull out 5-600 of those. I often thought: In the past, I had to work to eat, I was tired from morning to night, and my back and arms ached. Now I don't have to worry about life, why should I work so hard? Last year, I only completed the plan for half a month, and I haven't completed the plan at all this year.

    I don't like to study, and I hate attending meetings even more. I've attended amateur school several times, and I'm still in the first grade. I get bored when I do arithmetic. I buy opera tickets, so I don't care about studying or attending meetings, I can't let the tickets go to waste. Once my father told me, "You're going to see a movie instead of attending a meeting without asking for leave, you're going to get criticized!" I said: I'm not afraid, I'll give him a piece of my mind! Being a worker is all about working, and I'll play when I have time. What's the use of studying or attending meetings? My lover works at the Tianjin State-owned Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, and he is a member of the Communist Youth League. He often talks to me about politics, but I don't listen. If he says too much, I argue with him. I thought to myself: "Listening to opera is so much better, what's the use of talking about big principles!"

    Recently, our factory has strengthened education on labor discipline. The leaders pointed out that some workers are not observing labor discipline, such as asking for leave when they are not sick, and fighting and cursing in the workshop. When I heard this, I realized that I was guilty of at least 90% of these things. During group discussions, everyone helped me, and the Youth League branch also helped me. I realized that I was wrong in the past! Listening to the reading of newspapers about the past working attitude of Li Zhiping, a female worker at the Tianjin State-owned Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, she was a bit like me. If she can change, why can't I? Wang Huizhen in our factory used to be quite backward, but now she has made progress and become a party member. The labor model Ma Fenglan is constantly looking for ways to create wealth for the country, and why? Why am I just muddling through like this all day long? Thinking of these things, I feel very sad. I promise to correct my mistakes, strictly abide by labor discipline, strengthen my studies, improve my political consciousness, and complete the production plan. Recently, I have been able to complete the plan.

    我认识了违犯劳动纪律的错误
    王秀珍
    我是恒大烟草厂包烟女工，打十四岁进厂做工，到现在已经八年多了。解放以后，我们工人生活一天比一天好，每天吃的是大米白面，什么新鲜菜下来吃什么，不再像解放前那样整天愁吃愁喝了。我就想：真是解放了，工人翻了身了，一个工人，顶到这也就到了头了，这时候不乐呵乐呵还等什么。我现在顶爱看评戏，过去根本看不上，好容易解放了，工人也能看戏了，我还不该多看点戏吗？我对那个戏园子排嘛新戏都知道，下了班打电话订张票，第二天就找个词，歇班听戏。去年有一天我早上起来一看，下小蒙蒙雨了，路挺难走，我就想：不去上工了，扣一天工钱才一两万块钱，算什么！生产好坏也不在乎一天半天啊！上床蒙上被又睡觉了。醒来一睁眼，天晴了，已经十点多，我就到工厂去请假。我撒谎说我妈妈病了，小组的同志们都很关心，说：你还不快去请假，给你妈妈治病去！我心里想：着嘛急，根本没事。可是表面上还装着。跑到领导同志那里一说，领导同志让我以后按制度请假，把我给气哭了，我想：我请假我自己少拿工钱，为什么还那么罗嗦！请了假，我没回家，先到朋友家串个门，下午去看了场评戏。
    国民党反动统治时候，有病歇班不给钱，弄不好就把你开除了；现在政府为了照顾工人，实行了劳保条例，有病歇班不少拿钱。所以，我心里一不痛快，有个头疼脑热的，就到大夫那去“磨”假。我这病，说是病也算病，说不是病也不算病，大夫给我拿药，我不吃，叫我歇着又嫌闷的慌，就去看电影、听评戏。组里边有的同志劝我，说常请假就完不成计划了。我听了，表面上哼哼哈哈，心里寻思：劳保条例不是让工人享受的吗？歇一天是一天，什么计划不计划的。解放前，工人有病不敢歇工，如今政府照顾咱，我心里不痛快，还不该松松心，喘喘气！
    我们厂子广播站，一到下午四点就放评戏、梆子。我常听戏，知道唱的是什么，谁唱的，就讲给大伙听，唱那句我都想得出来台上怎么作派，讲的有鼻子有眼儿。我看完戏上班，也对大伙“汇报”，脸对脸，一讲老半天，也顾不得干活了。有时候，到了四点没放戏，我就不高兴，把工长叫来，叫他打电话给广播站；有谁劝我一句，说我不该乱吵，妨碍生产，我就和他们拌嘴，我说：我乐意这样，用你多管闲事，这又不是解放前，工人连句话也不敢吭！人家不搭扯我，我就摔烟筐子，拿工具出气。我包烟，心顺了就包他二千几，心不顺包一千三、四就算了，一抽活五、六百包。我常想：过去为了吃饭，不干活不行，一天累到晚，累的我腰酸胳膊痛，现在生活不发愁了，我还那么玩命干嘛？我去年下半年只有半个月完成了计划，今年一直没完成计划。
    我不爱学习，更讨厌参加会。业余学校我上了好几回，到现在还是一年级，一算算术我就腻歪了。我买了戏票，不管学习、开会，反正不能叫票废了。有一次我爸爸说我，你开会不请假去看电影，等着挨批评吧！我就说：不怕，给他个耳朵够了！当工人会干活就行了，有空还玩会呢，学习、开会管嘛用？我爱人在天津国营第六棉纺织厂做工，是个青年团员，经常给我讲政治，我听不入耳，多说几句，我就跟他吵嘴。我心里想：“听听戏多美，讲些大道理顶什么用！”
    最近我们厂加强劳动纪律教育，领导上指出有些工友不遵守劳动纪律，什么没病请假啦，在车间打架骂街啦，我一听，这些事至少我占百分之九十。在小组讨论的时候，大伙帮助我，团支部也帮助我，我认识到过去不对啦！听读报读天津国营第六棉纺织厂女工李志苹过去的劳动态度，真有点像我，人家能转变，为什么我就不能？我们厂王惠珍过去也挺落后，现在进步成了党员啦；人家劳动模范马凤兰一天到晚找窍门，为国家创造财富，为了什么？我整天这样混又为了什么？想起这些，我很难过。我保证一定改正错误，好好遵守劳动纪律，加强学习，提高政治觉悟，完成生产计划。最近我已能完成计划了。
