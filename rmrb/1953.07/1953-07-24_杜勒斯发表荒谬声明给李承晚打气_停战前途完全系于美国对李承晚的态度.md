    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 23rd: Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: US Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement on the 22nd regarding Syngman Rhee's opposition to the armistice. In his statement, Dulles did not condemn Syngman Rhee and his henchmen's anti-armistice clamor in the slightest, but instead absurdly said that Syngman Rhee was "entitled to do so."

    Dulles admitted that Syngman Rhee had not accepted the armistice, but he had merely "given the United Nations another opportunity to unify Korea through political negotiations." Dulles said that Syngman Rhee "has been asking the United States for various guarantees, and at the same time, he has been reserving his government's position in case the political negotiations after the armistice break down." Dulles said, "We believe he is entitled to do so. As for the guarantees he requested, the US government has tried its best to meet his demands."

    What kind of position does Dulles think Syngman Rhee is "entitled" to reserve? Dulles did not dare to say it openly, but Syngman Rhee had already explained it on July 11th and reiterated it on July 22nd. This position is: He does not agree to the armistice, but he will not obstruct the armistice within three months. This is the so-called "opportunity" he grants to the United States. If the United States cannot enable him to achieve the goal of "unifying Korea" within these three months, then Syngman Rhee is "entitled" to resume the war. Syngman Rhee also demanded that the United States guarantee to continue the war with him at that time.

    People must ask: On what basis is Syngman Rhee "entitled" to re-launch the war after three months? Does the Korean armistice not include Syngman Rhee? If it is not included, is the guarantee proposed by the United States at Panmunjom that "the United Nations forces, including the Republic of Korea forces, are prepared to implement the terms of the armistice agreement" a lie? If it is included, but he is "entitled" to arbitrarily undermine the armistice after three months, how will the United States fulfill the guarantee it has made?

    The matter could not be clearer. Dulles' statement is fueling Syngman Rhee's clamor, encouraging Syngman Rhee, and encouraging him to dare to act recklessly. All this shows that although all signs at Panmunjom indicate that the preparations for signing the armistice agreement are rapidly approaching completion, if the armistice is not to suffer another setback like it did more than a month ago, and if the armistice agreement is to be fully implemented without being sabotaged, the US government must change its attitude of indulgence towards Syngman Rhee and must earnestly fulfill the formal promises it has made at the negotiating table.

    At the beginning of his statement, Dulles said: "The issue of the armistice depends on the Communist side." But in the face of ironclad facts, Dulles' attempt to shirk responsibility is useless. People can see very clearly that it was not the Korean-Chinese side that caused the setback to the Korean armistice, which could have been achieved at that time, more than a month ago, but on the contrary, it was Syngman Rhee on the American side who undermined the prisoner of war agreement. Now, it is not the Korean-Chinese side that opposes the armistice, but on the contrary, it is Syngman Rhee on the American side who opposes the armistice and clamors for being "unrestrained." Therefore, the matter could not be clearer, the future of the armistice entirely depends on the US government's attitude towards Syngman Rhee. People are becoming increasingly intolerant of the United States' so blatantly indulging Syngman Rhee. British parliamentarians clearly expressed this in the House of Commons yesterday.

### 杜勒斯发表荒谬声明给李承晚打气  停战前途完全系于美国对李承晚的态度

    杜勒斯发表荒谬声明给李承晚打气
    停战前途完全系于美国对李承晚的态度
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美国国务卿杜勒斯在二十二日就李承晚反对停战问题发表了一个声明。杜勒斯在声明中对李承晚及其爪牙的反停战叫嚣丝毫没有加以谴责，反而荒谬绝伦地说李承晚是“有权利这样做的”。
    杜勒斯承认：李承晚并没有接受停战，他只不过是“给予联合国另一个机会以政治谈判方式来统一朝鲜”。杜勒斯说，李承晚“一直要求美国方面给予他种种保证，同时，他一直保留着他的政府的主张，以防万一停战以后的政治谈判破裂”。杜勒斯说，“我们认为，他有权利这样做。至于他要求的保证，美国政府已尽量满足他的要求。”
    杜勒斯认为李承晚“有权利”保留的是个什么样的主张？杜勒斯没有敢明目张胆地说出来，但是李承晚在七月十一日早已经说明过，并且在七月二十二日又重申过。这个主张就是：他不同意停战，但是他将在三个月之内不阻挠停战。这就是他赏脸给美国的所谓“机会”。如果美国在这三个月之内不能使他达到“统一朝鲜”的目的，那末李承晚就“有权利”要恢复战争。李承晚还要求美国保证到那时候和他一起继续进行战争。
    人们要问：李承晚凭什么有“权利”在三个月之后重新发动战争？难道朝鲜停战不包括李承晚在内？如果不包括在内，美国在板门店提出的“联合国军包括大韩民国军队在内准备实施停战协定的条款”的保证，难道是骗人的？如果包括在内，可是他又“有权利”在三个月之后任意破坏停战，美国将怎样履行它所提出的保证？
    事情再明显也没有了。杜勒斯这个声明是在给李承晚的叫嚣加油，给李承晚打气，鼓励他更加敢于胡作非为。这一切说明：虽然板门店的一切迹象都表明停战协定签字的准备工作正在迅速接近完成，但是如果要使停战不致再像一个多月以前那样遭到挫折，要使停战协定能够全部实施而不致遭到破坏，美国政府必须改变它对李承晚的纵容态度，必须切实履行它在谈判桌上所作的正式诺言。
    杜勒斯在他的声明一开头就说：“停战的问题要看共产党方面了。”但是在铁的事实面前，杜勒斯要想推卸责任是没有用处的。人们看得很清楚，在一个多月以前并不是由朝中方面，恰恰相反，是由于美国方面的李承晚破坏了战俘协议，原在当时就可以实现的朝鲜停战才受到了挫折。现在，也并不是朝中方面反对停战，恰恰相反，正是美国方面的李承晚反对停战，叫嚣“不受约束”。因此，事情再明显也没有了，停战前途完全系于美国政府对李承晚的态度。人们对于美国如此放肆地纵容李承晚，已经感到越来越不能忍受了。英国议员们昨天在下议院已经明白地表达了这一点。
