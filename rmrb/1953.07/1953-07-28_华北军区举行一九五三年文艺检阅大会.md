    North China Military Region Holds 1953 Arts Performance Review Conference
    The North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held the 1953 Arts Performance Review Conference from June 25th to July 3rd. Participating in the review were arts troupes from various units and soldiers' arts representative teams. A total of 127 programs were performed over six evenings.
    The purpose of the conference was to further implement the General Political Department of the Military Commission's policy on literary and artistic work, establish role models, and learn from each other. In addition to performances and viewing, the conference also held symposiums on music, dance, and storytelling; it organized the representative teams to learn exemplary programs from each other to take back to their own units for promotion. The programs participating in the review were mostly songs, dances, storytelling, and a small number of skills.
    The special prize-winning "Singing of Hero Huang Jiguang" (a collaboration between literary and artistic team member Zhong Chengxiu and a quartermaster of a certain unit, Wang Youkang, the latter performing) made relatively full use of various tunes from Mei County and Hu County in northern Shaanxi to express the hero's thoughts and emotions. Wu Tianxing, a cook from a certain unit who won first prize for singing, was familiar with many folk songs from Suiyuan and Shanxi. Through his continuous adaptation and creation, he used them to depict the life of the cooking squad and the emotions of a revolutionary family. The "Soldiers' Joyful Dance" and "Soldiers' Game Dance" created by the soldiers, which won first prize for dance performance, also adopted dance movements from local operas, expressing the soldiers' unity, joy, and optimistic spirit. Soldiers of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups, together with Han soldiers, performed dances of their own ethnic groups and used willow leaves to play various folk songs. The cavalry units turned Mongolian-favored wrestling into a dance, and also incorporated the tactical characteristics and valiant spirit of the cavalry into the "Cavalry Life Dance." In addition, many companies formed small orchestras with folk instruments such as erhu, flute, sheng, and suona, playing various beautiful and moving folk songs.
    The award evaluation work of the conference started from the existing level of company-level literary and artistic activities. The selected programs should have a demonstrative effect on the entire military region; the ideological content of the works should vividly and powerfully cooperate with the overall task of army building, the training tasks of each period, and inspire the fighting spirit of the troops; attention was paid to the uneven development of literary and artistic activities among various units, and appropriate consideration was given to companies with lower levels but actively carrying out literary and artistic activities. The award evaluation work was carried out on the basis of discussions between cultural cadres and representatives from each team.
    After the closing of the conference, the Political Department of the North China Military Region decided to establish a temporary "Soldiers' Arts Performance Team" to conduct key demonstration performances in various combat units in order to implement the spirit of this conference.

    华北军区举行一九五三年文艺检阅大会
    中国人民解放军华北军区于六月二十五日至七月三日举行一九五三年文艺检阅大会。参加检阅的有各部队的文艺工作队和士兵的文艺代表队。在六个晚会中共演出一百二十七个节目。
    大会的目的是进一步贯彻军委总政治部的文艺工作方针，树立榜样，互相学习。大会除演出观摩外，并举行了音乐、舞蹈、说唱等座谈会；组织各代表队互相学习有示范性的节目，带回自己的部队去推广。参加检阅的节目大都是歌、舞、说唱和一小部分技艺。
    获特等奖的“歌唱英雄黄继光”（文工队员钟承修和某部司务长王有康合作，后者演唱），是运用陕北郿鄠的各种曲调，比较充分地表达了英雄的思想情绪。获歌唱一等奖的某部炊事员吴天星，熟悉许多绥远和山西的民歌，经过他不断地加以改编和创造，用来描写了炊事班生活和革命大家庭的情绪。获舞蹈演出一等奖的士兵们创作的“战士欢乐舞”和“战士游戏舞”，也都是采用地方戏曲中的舞蹈动作，表现了士兵们的团结、愉快和乐观主义情绪。苗族、彝族的士兵和汉族士兵一起表演自己民族的舞蹈，和用柳叶来吹奏各种民歌。骑兵部队则把蒙古民族爱好的摔跤编成舞蹈，也将骑兵的战术特点和慓悍勇猛的气派编成“骑兵生活舞”。其他还有许多连队用二胡、笛、笙、唢呐等民间乐器组成小乐队，演奏各种优美动听的民歌。
    大会的评奖工作，从连队文艺活动的现有水平出发，被评选的节目要对全军区有示范作用；作品的思想内容，要生动有力地配合建军的总任务、每一时期的训练任务和焕发鼓舞部队的战斗情绪；注意到各部队之间文艺活动发展不平衡状态，适当照顾水平较低，但又是努力开展文艺活动的连队。评奖工作是在文化干部与各代表队的讨论基础上进行的。
    大会闭幕后，华北军区政治部决定成立临时的“士兵文艺演出队”，有重点地到各战斗部队做巡回示范演出，以贯彻这次大会的精神。
