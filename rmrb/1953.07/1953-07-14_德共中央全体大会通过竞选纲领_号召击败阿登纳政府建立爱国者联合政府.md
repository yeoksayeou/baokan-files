(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 13th) According to a report by the TASS news agency from Berlin on the 12th: The German News Agency reported that the Central Committee of the German Communist Party held its ninth plenary session in Düsseldorf on July 9th. The agenda of the conference was: The tasks of the German Communist Party in the election and the party's election program "Striving for Peace, National Unity, and Social Security."

    Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party, explained in detail the party's election program in his report and outlined the party's tasks in the election.

    Reimann said: The German people demand the overthrow of the Adenauer government and the establishment of a true German government that will concentrate all its efforts on ensuring the realization of peace and ensuring that the German people and the major powers reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the German question. He called on all peace-loving patriotic forces to rise up against the Adenauer government and defeat it in the elections.

    Reimann, on behalf of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, exposed the Adenauer authorities' terror campaign against the German Communist Party's election efforts. He called on the party to protest against the arbitrary police rule in West Germany and to be vigilant against new attempts by German and foreign imperialists to undermine peace.

    The conference adopted the German Communist Party's election program for the September 6th Federal Parliament election.

    The election program of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party emphasized that helping the forces advocating agreement, peace, and unity to win in West Germany is a major task for the German working people in their struggle for peace. All people welcome the easing of international tensions. The situation in Germany must also eventually ease, but this can only be achieved if the pro-American Adenauer government is forced to resign. Replacing this government must be a coalition government composed of German patriots, which will end the "Cold War" and represent and safeguard the national interests of the people. The Communist Party is willing to fight side by side with all parties and patriotic organizations that oppose the shameful Bonn and Paris treaties and support German unity and agreements with the major powers in the election to overthrow the Adenauer government.

    The program pointed out that during the four years of rule by the Bonn ruling party, the Bonn government not only failed to eliminate militarism but also intensified militarization and preparations for war to cater to a small number of West German and foreign monopoly capitalists. They participated in the so-called Marshall Plan, passed the Schuman Plan, and approved the Bonn and Paris war treaties, which divided Germany and threatened peace, against the will of the West German people and all German people.

    The Bonn government obstructed the national unity of the German people. It rejected all proposals made by the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic aimed at rebuilding Germany. Not only that, but the Bonn government also launched a "Cold War" against the German Democratic Republic, and they even resorted to fascist provocations. This policy of the Bonn government seriously affected the situation of the West German people, deprived them of their basic democratic rights and freedoms, and threatened the progress of a peaceful economy.

    The program called on West German male and female voters to refuse to vote for parties subservient to Adenauer, thereby creating the possibility of forming a coalition government that strives for peace, agreement, and freedom. The program called on the people to vote for the German Communist Party, because it is the only party that consistently strives for peace and German unity.

    The slogans put forward by the German Communist Party are: Strive for an agreement between the German people! Strive for the establishment of a coalition government of German patriots! Stop the "Cold War" at home and abroad! Restore German unity! Strive for the conclusion of a just peace treaty with Germany! Withdraw all foreign troops! Strive for peace, unity and democracy! Strive for a better life and social progress for the working people!

    德共中央全体大会通过竞选纲领
    号召击败阿登纳政府建立爱国者联合政府
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林十二日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央委员会七月九日在杜塞尔多夫举行第九次全体大会。大会的议程是：德国共产党在竞选中的任务及党的竞选纲领“争取和平、国家统一和社会安全”。
    德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼在报告中详细说明了党的竞选纲领，并扼要说明了党在竞选中的任务。
    雷曼说：德国人民要求推翻阿登纳政府，建立一个真正的德国政府，这个政府将集中全力来确保和平的实现，确保德国人民之间以及大国在和平解决德国问题上达成协议。他号召所有爱好和平的爱国力量起来反对阿登纳政府以在选举中击败它。
    雷曼代表德国共产党中央委员会揭发了阿登纳当局针对德国共产党的竞选进行的恐怖活动。他要求党抗议西德的专横的警察统治，并提高警惕，防备德国和外国帝国主义者打击和平的新企图。
    大会通过了德国共产党参加九月六日联邦议院选举的竞选纲领。
    德国共产党中央委员会的竞选纲领强调说：帮助主张取得协议、和平与统一的力量在西德获得胜利，是德国劳动人民在争取和平的斗争中的重大任务。所有人民都欢迎国际紧张局势的缓和。德国的局势最终也必须缓和，但是只有亲美的阿登纳政府被迫辞职才有可能达到这个目的。代替这个政府的必须是一个由德国爱国者组成的联合政府，这个政府将结束“冷战”，代表并维护人民的民族利益。共产党愿意与所有反对可耻的波恩与巴黎条约、赞成德国统一与大国协议的各党派及爱国团体在选举中并肩斗争，来推翻阿登纳政府。
    纲领指出，在波恩执政党当权的四年中间，波恩政府不但不肃清军国主义，反而加紧军国主义化，加紧备战来迎合一小撮西德和外国垄断资本家。他们参加了所谓马歇尔计划，通过了舒曼计划，违背西德人民和所有德国人民的意志批准了分裂德国和威胁和平的波恩与巴黎战争条约。
    波恩政府阻挠德国人民的民族团结。它拒绝德意志民主共和国人民议会和政府提出的一切目的在重建德国的建议。非但如此，波恩政府还对德意志民主共和国发动“冷战”，他们甚至不惜进行法西斯挑衅。波恩政府的这种政策，严重地影响到西德人民的处境，剥夺了他们的基本民主权利与自由，威胁到和平经济的进展。
    纲领号召西德男女选民拒绝投屈从阿登纳的政党的票从而创造组成一个为和平、协议与自由而努力的联合政府的可能性。纲领号召人民投德国共产党的票，因为这是唯一的始终不渝地为和平与德国的统一而努力的政党。
    德国共产党提出的口号是：争取德国人民之间的协议！争取建立德国爱国者的联合政府！制止国内外的“冷战”！恢复德国的统一！争取缔结一个公正的对德和约！撤退所有外国军队！争取和平、统一与民主！争取劳动人民的美好生活和社会进步！
