The First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry inspected the implementation of the construction plan on the 9th of this month and decided to take effective measures to reverse the slow construction progress.

The company originally planned to start construction on 56 projects in the first half of the year, but only 28 projects had started by the end of June. The plan was to complete 30.8 percent of the annual task by the end of May to the end of June, but the actual progress was only 24.5 percent. The planned progress for June was 16.2 percent of the annual task, but the actual completion was 9.9 percent. This slow progress had not improved by early July. The first construction site planned to complete 7 percent of the annual task in the first ten days of this month, but only completed 3 percent by the 8th. Other construction sites also failed to complete the plan on time.

The reasons for the slow construction progress are as follows: First, of the projects planned to start construction in the first half of the year, 28 projects failed to start construction. Among them, three were due to poor design, eight due to design changes, six due to poor planning, six due to plan changes, two due to failure to prepare a budget and failure to sign a contract, one due to late arrival of drawings, and two due to lack of materials.

Second, the biggest factor affecting the progress is the poor and unrealistic construction operation plan for the projects that have already started construction. The main reasons are three: 1. There is no annual construction plan and no overall construction budget. Therefore, the overall technical supply plan cannot be made, and preparatory work cannot be started. Because there is no overall progress, the monthly plan loses its clear goal, and it is not known how the failure to complete this project plan will affect the next project. Many projects are pushed from this month to the next month, so that the plan loses its guiding and controlling role for the project. 2. Most projects have monthly plans but no ten-day plans, no specific measures plans, and have not been discussed and revised by construction personnel, and workers have not been mobilized to formulate team action plans, so that the realization of the monthly plan loses a reliable guarantee. In the first ten days of July, only the fifth construction site of the six construction units made a ten-day plan, and the other construction sites did not submit it. The phenomenon of not considering construction methods or considering them poorly in the operation plan is very common. For example, the middle section of the main building project of the second construction site is relatively complicated. During construction, it started from the north and south ends. As a result, the engineering in the middle was delayed, and the projects on both sides could not be carried out. The operation plans of each construction site have not been well organized for mass discussion to formulate a guarantee plan. The flat house construction team only talked about the percentage of the month to be completed when explaining the plan to the workers. The workers would not calculate the percentage, so the team plan could not be formulated. In this way, the monthly plan is just a formality. 3. The root cause of the poor construction operation plan is that the leading cadres of each construction site generally lack a sense of planning and do not know or are not good at guiding construction with planning. Secondly, there is a lack of a system for preparing operation plans. What plans should be made in the construction site, to what extent should the monthly ten-day plan be made, what plans should the construction worker and the worker team make, who should explain to the workers, and who should supervise and inspect, these are not clearly defined.

Third, the attendance rate and operation rate of workers are very low. The total number of workers attending and working at each construction site in June accounted for 69.7 percent of the actual number of people, and the downtime, late arrivals and early departures of the actual number of workers accounted for 26.8 percent of the man-hours. For example, the average number of workers attending and working at the first construction site in June only accounted for 59.4 percent of the actual number of people. Among the absent workers, most of them were idle and delayed due to poor planning, imbalance in multi-work operations, and poor allocation of labor. Relaxed labor discipline, many work-related injuries and sick leave also affected the attendance rate.

In response to the above situation, the company decided to take specific measures to strive for a large number of construction starts. The company is preparing to organize technicians and staff to go to the construction site. While establishing and improving the construction responsibility system, it will help each construction site to prepare a good construction operation plan. The specific methods are: 1. Actively strive to hold a joint meeting between Party A and Party B to determine the start date and the arrival date of drawings, clarify responsibilities, help each other, and supervise and inspect each other; organize the second phase of the start-up inspection team to help the construction site overcome the difficulties in the preparation work and strive to start construction in a timely manner; strengthen the work of the company's engineering section and technical supply department, and oppose the waiting mentality under the excuse of "no contract, no construction"; strengthen the preparation work and create conditions for timely construction. 2. Convene a meeting of leading cadres and planning personnel of each construction site to criticize the idea of not paying attention to planning, exchange experience, commend units that have better compilation and implementation of plans, and criticize backward units; the company manager should focus on the general dispatching room, grasp the daily progress, and conduct supervision and inspection. 3. Organize a work team to go to the construction site to help the construction site quickly make a construction budget; make specific measures plans for the operation plan; and promote the construction task list in the worker teams. 4. Strengthen the planning review work. The company's planning section should grasp the progress indicators, the general dispatching room should grasp the technical supply, and the engineering section should grasp the technical measures to prevent and correct unrealistic phenomena of excessively high or low plans. 5. Require the construction site to strengthen political work, and the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League should work in unison and strive to complete the engineering tasks. Strengthen discipline education, and strive to complete the operation plan on time under the requirement of ensuring quality.

    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司开始扭转施工进度迟缓现象
    中央重工业部有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司，于本月九日检查施工计划执行情况，决定采取有效措施扭转施工进度迟缓现象。
    该公司原计划上半年有五十六件工程开工，但截止六月底只开工二十八件；五月底计划到六月底完成全年任务百分之三十点八，实际进度只达到百分之二十四点五；六月份计划进度为全年任务的百分之十六点二，实际完成百分之九点九。这种进度迟缓现象，直到七月上旬仍未好转，第一工地计划本月上旬完成全年任务百分之七，但到八日只完成百分之三。其他工地也都没有按时完成计划。
    施工进度迟缓的原因有以下几点：第一，上半年计划要开工的工程中，有二十八件工程实际都未能开工。其中因设计不周的三件，设计变更的八件，计划不周的六件，计划变更的六件，预算未编出不能订合同的二件，图纸到迟的一件，缺料的二件。
    第二，影响进度最大的是已经开工的工程施工作业计划不周，不切合实际。其主要原因有三：一、没有全年的施工计划，没有总的施工预算，因而，总的技术供应计划做不出来，准备工作无从下手。由于没有总的进度，就使得月度计划失去明确目标，也不知道这项工程计划完不成对下一项工程的影响。许多工程都是这月完不成推到下月，使计划失掉了对工程的指导和控制作用。二、多数工程有月计划没有旬计划，没有具体措施计划，更没有经过施工人员讨论修正，没有发动工人订出小组行动计划，使月计划的实现失掉了可靠的保证。七月上旬六个施工单位只有第五工地作了旬计划，其他工地都没有提出。在作业计划中不考虑施工方法或考虑不周的现象很普遍。如第二工地主楼工程中间一段比较复杂，施工时从南北两头做起，结果因中间工程拖后，两边工程就不能进行。各工地作业计划都没有很好组织群众讨论，订出保证计划，平房工程队向工人交代计划只空谈了一下当月要完成的百分数，工人不会算百分数，小组计划也就无从订起。这样，就使得月计划徒具形式。三、施工作业计划做得不好的根源，首先是各工地领导干部普遍缺乏计划观念，不懂得或不善于用计划指导施工。其次是缺乏编制作业计划的制度，在工地里应该作那些计划，月旬计划作到什么程度，施工员与工人小组应作什么计划，谁向工人群众交代，又由谁来督促检查，这些都没有明确规定。
    第三，工人出勤率和作业率很低。各工地六月份总的出勤作业人数占实有人数百分之六十九点七，实际作业人数中停工、迟到早退时间又占工时的百分之二十六点八。如第一工地六月份出勤作业人数平均只占实有人数的百分之五十九点四。在缺勤的工人中，大多数是因为计划不周、多工种作业不平衡以及劳动力调配不好等而造成的闲工、窝工。劳动纪律松弛，工伤及请病假的人多也影响了出勤率。
    该公司针对上述情况，决定采取具体措施，争取大量开工。公司准备组织技术人员、职员下工地，在建立与健全施工责任制度的同时，帮助各工地作好施工作业计划。具体办法是：一、积极争取举行甲乙双方联席会议，确定开工日期及图纸到达日期，分清责任、互助合作，互相督促检查；组织第二期开工检查组，帮助工地克服准备工作中的困难，争取及时开工；加强公司工务科、技术供应部门的工作，反对藉口“没有合同不能开工”的等待思想；加强准备工作，为及时开工创造条件。二、召开各工地领导干部及计划人员会议，批判不重视计划的思想，交流经验，表扬编制与执行计划较好的单位，批评落后单位；公司经理抓紧总调度室，掌握每日进度情况，进行督促检查。三、组织工作组下工地，帮助工地迅速作出施工预算；做好作业计划的具体措施计划；在工人小组中推行施工任务单。四、加强计划汇审工作，公司计划科掌握进度指标，总调度室掌握技术供应，工务科掌握技术措施，防止与纠正计划过高或过低的不切合实际现象。五、要求工地加强政治工作，党、行政、工会、青年团步调一致，为完成工程任务努力。加强纪律教育，在保证质量的要求下，为按时完成作业计划而奋斗。
