Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: According to a Deutsche Press Agency report on the 9th: French and German university lecturers held a conference in Paris in May to discuss a peaceful resolution to the German question. After the meeting, French lecturer H. Pugeaud wrote to Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, sending him the resolutions of the conference. In his reply to French lecturer H. Pugeaud, President Pieck welcomed the conference participants' initiatives regarding maintaining peace, restoring German unity, and strengthening Franco-German friendship. The letter stated: The Soviet Union's proposed Great Power talks are in the interests of all peoples and greatly contribute to the peaceful resolution of all existing problems, including the restoration of the freedom that the German people have always hoped for. However, it cannot be ignored that American capitalists oppose a peaceful resolution and are increasingly and deliberately attempting to undermine it. In order to achieve a peaceful resolution, the world peace movement must subdue these anti-people forces.

President Pieck wrote: Strengthening the friendship between the working people of Germany and France in their struggle against the fascist provocations of the United States and its West German lackeys is a prerequisite for maintaining peace in Western Europe.

President Pieck exposed that the West German Adenauer government verbally supports German unity but opposes discussions on the restoration of German unity by representatives from East and West Germany, discussions which would help in concluding a peace treaty.

President Pieck said: The German Democratic Republic now, as in the past, adheres to this fundamental policy principle: the rapid restoration of a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful all-German government. The aim of forming an all-German government is to conclude a peace treaty based on the Potsdam Agreement. He finally pointed out: Some new measures recently adopted by the government of the German Democratic Republic demonstrate its desire, and these measures have a significant role in the peaceful resolution of the German question and the maintenance of peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th dispatch via TASS: The West German Farmers' Congress was held in Cologne under the auspices of the League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom. The congress was attended by four hundred representatives of farmers and forestry workers from all over West Germany.

Former Mayor and Chairman of the League, Wilhelm Elfes, emphasized that the main task of the German people is for all Germans to take united and resolute action to strive for Great Power consultations.

The next speaker was Hasel, Chairman of the Bavarian Farmers' League, who pointed out that the war preparations being undertaken in West Germany seriously affect the lives of farmers. He said: Our slogan is: Stop the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties! Stop war preparations! Long live German unity!

The congress called on West German farmers to defeat the Adenauer government in the upcoming elections and form a peaceful, unified, and progressive government.

The congress passed the fifteen-point rural program of the League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom. This program stipulates the adoption of measures in West Germany, such as returning land confiscated from farmers for military use to the farmers, prohibiting military exercises on farmers' land, reducing taxes, granting loans to farmers, eliminating the price difference between agricultural products and manufactured goods, restoring democratic trade, expanding housing construction, and building schools in rural areas. The program calls on West German farmers to fight against the Bonn Treaty and the "European Defense Community" treaty. The program calls for the restoration of German unity on a democratic basis, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and the withdrawal of occupying forces in East and West Germany.

The program also calls on West German farmers to elect candidates from the League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom in the upcoming elections.

    西德农民要求在民主基础上恢复德国统一
    【新华社十日讯】据德意志通讯社九日讯：法国和德国大学讲师五月间曾在巴黎举行会议，讨论和平解决德国问题。会后，法国的赫·普葛讲师曾写信给德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克，把会议的决议寄给他。皮克总统在给法国赫·普葛讲师回信中，表示欢迎会议参加者关于保持和平、恢复德国统一及加强法德人民友谊的倡议。信中说：苏联所提议的大国会谈，符合所有人民的利益，大大有助于和平解决所有存在的一些问题，包括恢复德国人民一直期望着的自由在内。但是，不能忽视的是，美国的资本家们反对和平解决，并正愈来愈处心积虑地企图破坏和平解决。为了达到和平解决，世界和平运动必须压服这些仇视人民的力量。
    皮克总统写道：加强德法两国劳动人民在他们反对美国和它西德的仆从的法西斯挑衅者的斗争中的友谊，是维护西欧和平的先决条件。
    皮克总统揭露西德阿登纳政府口头上说赞成德国统一，却反对由东西德的代表在一起讨论恢复德国统一的问题，这种讨论是会有助于缔结和约的。
    皮克总统说：德意志民主共和国现在和以往一样，坚持这个基本政策原则：迅速恢复一个统一、独立、民主、和平的全德政府。组成一个全德政府，目的在根据波茨坦协定缔结和约。他最后指出：德意志民主共和国政府最近通过的一些新措施，证明了它的这种愿望，这些措施对和平解决德国问题及维持和平有重大作用。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社柏林八日讯：西德农民代表大会在德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟主持下在科隆举行。参加大会的有来自西德各地的四百个农民与造林工人代表。
    前市长及联盟主席威廉·艾尔费斯强调指出：全体德国人为争取大国协商而采取一致的、统一的和坚决的行动，是德国人民的主要任务。
    接着发言的是巴伐利亚农民联盟主席哈泽尔，他指出：西德从事的战争准备严重地影响了农民的生活。他说：我们的口号是：阻止批准波恩和巴黎的条约！制止战争准备！全德统一万岁！
    大会号召西德农民在即将举行的选举中击败阿登纳政府，组成一个和平的、统一的与进步的政府。
    大会通过了德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟的十五点农村纲领。这个纲领规定在西德采取一些措施，如把征作军用的农民的土地归还给农民、禁止在农民土地上进行军事演习、减低赋税、给予农民贷款、消除农产品与制造品价格之间的差额、恢复民主贸易、扩大房屋建筑、在乡下建造学校等。纲领要求西德农民为反对波恩条约与“欧洲防务集团”条约而斗争。纲领要求在民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，缔结和约，撤退在东德和西德的占领军。
    纲领同时号召西德农民在即将举行的选举中，选举德国人争取统一和平与自由联盟的候选人。
