Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch:

    In the past year, the organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in factories and mines in Beijing have developed rapidly, and the number of Communist Party members has almost doubled since before July last year.

    The new Party members developed in factories and mines in Beijing are all outstanding figures in production and work, and many have become advanced producers and model workers on the production front. In the 546 Factory, the whole factory generally failed to meet the production plan in January this year. Liu Shusi, a new Party member in the second workshop, organized the workers in his group to study their work and solve key problems, thereby driving the workers in the entire workshop to find tricks and tap their potential. By the end of February, the production efficiency of the entire workshop had increased by 113.6 percent. In the freight car yard of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the uneven welding of the top plate had long affected production. Zheng Xikun, a new Party member, and activist Wang Jigeng, after hard research, created a set of special tools to solve this key problem. Cui Zhenjiang, Bai Yuliang, and Li Yunlong, new Party members of the factory, created a new set of operating methods on the basis of diligently learning advanced experience, which increased production efficiency by 40 percent. Many of the labor models and advanced producers evaluated in the city in 1952 are new Party members, including Huang Runping, the creator of the famous new warehouse management method, who joined the Party in August 1952. Many of these Party members have also become excellent production leaders. From October to December 1952, a total of 341 Party member cadres were promoted in 26 larger factories and mines in the city, and many of them were new Party members.

    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted a positive and prudent approach to the work of building the Party in factories and mines, first strengthening the education of new Party members before they join the Party to improve their awareness. After the "Three-Anti" movement last year, a large number of activists emerged in 26 larger factories and mines. In addition to providing them with daily education, the Party also organized them into study groups or amateur training classes to conduct education on communism and the Communist Party. After this study, their level of awareness has been significantly improved, and they are determined to overcome shortcomings, work hard in production, and temper and test themselves in practice to strive to be a glorious Communist Party member. By May of this year, in addition to absorbing this group of activists into the Party, more than 9,000 activists had emerged in these enterprises. Factories and mines also conducted serious reviews of applicants for Party membership to ensure the quality of receiving new Party members.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th Dispatch: Outstanding workers in factories and mines in Chongqing are constantly joining the Chinese Communist Party. Since June last year, in 49 large and medium-sized factories and mines with more than 400 people in the city alone, more than 6,700 advanced workers in production have been admitted to the Party, greatly enhancing the Party's leading role in production.

    Among the new Party members developed, veteran technical workers account for more than 80 percent. In addition, it also includes a portion of young workers and technicians. After joining the Party, these advanced workers have received direct education and training from the Party, and their class consciousness has been improved, and their enthusiasm for production has been further stimulated. They have become role models for encouraging the masses to move forward. For example, Tu Genfu, a Communist Party member with 34 years of quenching experience in the 27296 Factory, actively tried to use a high-temperature salt bath for quenching in the first quarter of this year. The trial firing results were good, and he finally overcame the difficulty that the quenching task was heavy and the equipment problem could not be solved. He has been rated as a labor model and advanced producer in the factory four times and as a learning model twice.

    Many new Party members use their exemplary spirit in production to drive the masses to create new achievements. Huang Rongchang, a carpenter from the 101 Steel Plant, joined the Party and worked hard for one and a half years to change the manual operation of the carpentry workshop into machine operation, which greatly improved production efficiency. Under the influence of this spirit, many workers in the carpentry workshop actively worked with him to create ten machines such as shuttle machines and drilling machines. After being admitted to the Party, some technicians were able to closely rely on the workers to promote production. For example, He Haiyuan, an engineer from the 21527 Factory, in order to help workers improve their skills and unite other technicians in the trial production of new products, organized a technical research group to improve the technical level of the workers. Due to his improvement of tools, the fourth workshop of the factory completed the trial production of new products ahead of schedule.

    Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 29th Dispatch: In the agricultural areas of Xinjiang Province, 1,544 outstanding farmers of Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, and other ethnic groups have joined the organization of the Chinese Communist Party; the Party has also established 262 branches in 276 townships.

    These Party organizations in rural areas have become the driving force for implementing the policies of the Party and the People's Government and developing production. The Party branches in the first, second, and fifth townships of the Huiyuan District of Suiding County have a total of eleven Party members from Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, and Han nationalities. Because they are closely united and discuss matters in their work, they have set an example of ethnic unity for farmers of all ethnic groups. During the summer harvest in 1952, some farmers in the Huiyuan District lacked labor. The Party members mobilized farmers of all ethnic groups to help each other harvest, which solved the difficulties of families lacking labor. During the spring plowing and production this year, the Party branch of the second township of the fifth district of Artush County mobilized 112 farmers with surplus grain to lend more than 7,000 catties of grain to help 90 farmers overcome difficulties in production and life. This spring, when the People's Government promoted new agricultural tools such as sowers and cotton planters in the first township of the second district of Turpan County, the Party members first used sowers to sow wheat and went deep into the villages to publicize the benefits of new agricultural tools such as sowers, cotton planters, and cultivators. Therefore, new agricultural tools have gradually been promoted in the first township of the second district. This year, the area of wheat sown with sowers in this township accounted for half of the total area of wheat sown with sowers in the county, making the first township of the second district a typical demonstration township for the promotion of new agricultural tools in Turpan County. In March of this year, the Party branch of the first township of the second district also led the farmers to dig more than 40 lengths of karez, so that more than 1,000 mu of farmland were irrigated in a timely manner.

    The actions of Communist Party members in various places to lead and help farmers in production have been loved and supported by farmers of all ethnic groups. According to statistics, 799 Party members in the province have been elected as leaders of townships and villages by the farmers.

    北京、重庆等市工厂矿山企业中
    优秀工人纷纷加入中国共产党
    新疆省各民族优秀农民一千五百多人入党
    【新华社三十日讯】中国共产党北京市各工厂、矿山企业中的组织一年来有了迅速的发展，共产党员的人数比去年七月前增加将近一倍。
    北京市各工厂、矿山企业中发展的新党员都是生产中和工作中的优秀人物，不少的人成了生产战线上的先进生产者和劳动模范。在五四六工厂，今年一月份全厂普遍赶不上生产计划的进度，第二车间新党员刘述思便组织全组工人钻研业务，解决关键性问题，从而带动全车间工人找窍门、挖潜力。到二月底，全车间的生产效率就提高了百分之一百一十三点六。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂货车场，由于顶板焊不平，长期影响生产，新党员郑锡堃和积极分子王继耕经过艰苦的研究，创造一套专用工具，解决了这个关键性的问题；该厂新党员崔振江、白玉亮、李云龙在努力学习先进经验的基础上创造了一套新的操作方法，使生产效率提高百分之四十。全市一九五二年所评定的劳动模范与先进生产者中，有许多新党员，其中有著名的新仓库管理法的创造者黄润萍，他是在一九五二年八月入党的。这些党员中有不少人还成为优秀的生产领导者。一九五二年十月到十二月，全市二十六个较大的工厂、矿山企业中，共提拔了三百四十一名党员干部，其中便有不少是新党员。
    中共北京市委对于在工厂、矿山企业中建党的工作，采取了积极、慎重的方针，首先加强新党员入党前的教育工作，提高他们的觉悟程度。去年“三反”运动后，在二十六个较大工厂、矿山企业中涌现出大批的积极分子，党除对他们进行日常教育外，并将他们组成学习小组或业余训练班，进行共产主义与共产党的教育。经过这一学习后，他们的觉悟程度有显著提高，决心克服缺点，努力生产，在实际中锻炼考验自己，争取作一个光荣的共产党员。到今年五月，这些企业单位除已吸收了这批积极分子入党外，又涌现出九千多名积极分子。各工厂、矿山企业对于申请入党者也进行了严肃的审查，使接收新党员的质量有了保证。
    【新华社重庆三十日电】重庆市各工厂矿山企业中的优秀工人不断加入中国共产党。去年六月以来，仅全市四百人以上的四十九个大、中工厂、矿山企业中，就有六千七百多名生产中的先进职工被吸收入党，大大增强了党在生产中的领导作用。
    在发展的新党员中，老技术工人占百分之八十以上。此外，也包括一部分青年工人和技术人员。这些先进职工在入党后，受到党的直接教育和培养，阶级觉悟都有提高，生产积极性进一步发挥起来，他们已成为鼓舞群众前进的榜样。如二七二九六厂已有三十四年淬火工龄的共产党员屠根福在今年第一季度内积极想办法改用高温盐炉来淬火，试烧结果良好，终于克服了淬火任务重而设备问题无法解决的困难。他曾四次被评为全厂的劳动模范和先进生产者，两次被评为学习模范。
    许多新党员在生产中用自己的模范精神，带动群众创造出新的成绩。一零一钢铁厂木工黄荣昌入党后，在一年半时间内，刻苦钻研，把木工房的手工操作变为机器操作，大大提高了生产效率。在他这种精神影响下，木工房的许多工人都积极地和他共同创造了梭笋机、钻眼机等十部机器。部分技术人员在被吸收入党后，也都能紧密依靠工人，推动生产。例如二一五二七厂工程师何海源，在新产品试造中，为了帮助工人提高技术和团结其他技术人员，组织了技术研究小组，提高了工人的技术水平，由于他改进工具的结果，该厂第四车间提前完成了新产品试造任务。
    【新华社迪化二十九日电】新疆省农业地区已有一千五百四十四名维吾尔、哈萨克、汉、回等民族的优秀农民参加了中国共产党的组织；党并在二百七十六个乡中，先后建立了二百六十二个支部。
    农村中的这些党的组织，已经成为贯彻党和人民政府各项政策和发展生产的动力。绥定县惠远区一、二、五乡党支部共有维吾尔、哈萨克、回、汉族党员十一人，由于他们亲密团结，在工作中遇事商量，给各族农民作了民族团结的榜样。一九五二年夏收时，惠远区有些农民缺少劳动力，党员们就发动各族农民互相帮助收割，解决了缺少劳动力人家的困难。阿图什县五区二乡党支部在今年春耕生产中，发动有余粮的一百一十二户农民借出七千多斤粮食，帮助九十户农民克服了在生产和生活上的困难。今年春天，人民政府在吐鲁番县二区一乡推广摆耧、播棉机等新农具时，党员们首先使用摆耧播种小麦，并深入各村宣传摆耧、播棉机、中耕器等新式农具的好处，因此，新式农具已逐渐在二区一乡推广，今年这个乡使用摆耧播种的小麦占全县用摆耧播种小麦总面积的一半。使二区一乡成为吐鲁番县推广新式农具的典型示范乡。今年三月间，二区一乡党支部又领导农民掏挖了四十多丈坎儿井，使一千多亩农田适时得到灌溉。
    各地共产党员领导和帮助农民进行生产的行动，受到各族农民的爱戴和拥护，据统计全省已有七百九十九名党员，被农民选为乡和村的领导干部。
