Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 6th: This reporter Jiang Nan reports: The Korean armistice negotiations have been interrupted for sixteen days, and world opinion is watching how the United States government will deal with the serious situation caused by its policy of connivance with Syngman Rhee. Robertson has held his tenth meeting with Syngman Rhee today. The US government says it wants Syngman Rhee to agree to the armistice, but Syngman Rhee has received more and more encouragement to undermine the armistice; the US government says it has the sincerity to reach an armistice, but it is condoning Syngman Rhee to bury one time bomb after another for the armistice.

The first time bomb the United States buried on the road to peace in Korea was the "counter-proposal" put forward by the US side at Panmunjom on May 13. At that time, in order to accommodate Syngman Rhee's demand for forcibly detaining prisoners of war, the US side overturned the basis for the resumption of negotiations and put forward the unreasonable proposal to release the North Korean prisoners of war who were unwilling to be repatriated on the spot immediately after the armistice. Under the strong protests of world opinion, the United States had to withdraw this unreasonable proposal, while turning a blind eye to Syngman Rhee's preparations for forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

After the US side was forced to revise its "counter-proposal," Syngman Rhee's gang openly clamored against the armistice and manufactured a series of "anti-armistice demonstrations" in South Korea. On June 9, Syngman Rhee's "National Assembly" passed a resolution demanding "the immediate release of all Korean prisoners of war who refuse repatriation and the transfer of Chinese prisoners of war who refuse to return home to Taiwan." Subsequently, Syngman Rhee actively prepared. The "New York Times" correspondent in Seoul admitted on June 19: "For some time, it has been clear that prisoners of war are about to be released. Several newspapers have even published news that several related prisoner-of-war camps are guarded by South Koreans. The National Police stationed there are carrying food and clothing, ready to supply the prisoners of war who are scheduled to escape. At the same time, Won Yong-duk, commander of the South Korean military police, instructed the Korean people near the prisoner-of-war camp to 'fully cooperate with the military police who carry out my orders' to assist the escape of prisoners of war."

The US side clearly knew all of this, but they did not take and did not want to take any measures to prevent it. On June 18, just as Panmunjom was full of hope for an armistice, the time bomb buried by the US side on May 13 exploded. With the connivance of the US government, Syngman Rhee pulled away more than 25,000 prisoners of war from the prisoner-of-war camps.

The US side continued to adopt a conniving attitude towards Syngman Rhee's act of openly undermining the prisoner-of-war agreement. For several days in a row, the US side watched Syngman Rhee pull away large numbers of prisoners of war from the prisoner-of-war camps until the prisoner-of-war camps were almost empty, and then sent US troops to replace the South Korean troops. Then, the US side watched Syngman Rhee force prisoners of war to join the Rhee puppet army. On the one hand, the US side told the Korean and Chinese side that they would do their best to recover the "released" prisoners of war, but on the other hand, they ordered the US military police to "not even move" towards the prisoners of war who were being escorted on the streets by the South Korean police.

Syngman Rhee was obviously encouraged by the US side's attitude. He clamored even more frantically to refuse the armistice unless the US side agreed to sign a so-called "joint defense treaty" with him first, and limited the term of the political conference to three months. Instead of using its control over Syngman Rhee to subdue Syngman Rhee's recklessness, the US side immediately buried another time bomb on the road to peace in Korea together with Syngman Rhee. On the third day after Robertson arrived in Korea, he agreed to conclude a military alliance with Syngman Rhee. Since this military alliance had to be approved by the US Senate, which would take a considerable amount of time, Robertson complied with Syngman Rhee's wishes and agreed to conclude a temporary agreement with Syngman Rhee before the conclusion of a formal military alliance to give Syngman Rhee a military guarantee.

Since then, Syngman Rhee has insisted that if the political conference does not come up with a solution for the reunification of Korea that satisfies him within three months, the United States should re-launch the war with him. Although the United States has also released the air of "difficult to agree" on this point, news from Seoul said that Robertson has been discussing the issue of re-fighting.

According to a Seoul dispatch from the Associated Press on the 5th, Robertson has put forward a "two-point compromise" plan: "(1) If the political conference after the armistice has not made progress on the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea when the ninety days are over, the United States agrees to withdraw from the political conference together with South Korea. (2) After withdrawing from the political conference, the United States is willing to 'discuss' the issue of re-fighting the Communists through diplomatic channels." The United States is said to call these two compromise plans a "clever plan," but it is not difficult for discerning people to see that this "clever plan" is an encouragement to Syngman Rhee's criminal activities to undermine the armistice.

It is very obvious that this "two-point compromise" plan is actually burying two more time bombs in the future of peace in Korea. In terms of the political conference, the US side not only agreed to Syngman Rhee's demand to limit the political conference to ninety days, but also went a step further and agreed to adopt a consistent attitude with Syngman Rhee at the political conference, and to withdraw from the political conference together if their goals are not achieved. In this way, the United States has predetermined a task for the political conference, that is: to agree to the demands of the United States and Syngman Rhee within ninety days. The United States is clearly only trying to use the political conference as a tool to achieve their goal of undermining the armistice, rather than a place for all parties concerned to jointly discuss and resolve issues. Robertson's plan is actually an attempt by the United States and Syngman Rhee to unilaterally decide the future of the political conference, coercing all parties concerned to follow the United States and Syngman Rhee, and attempting to make the political conference doomed to failure before it is even held.

Since the political conference is bound to be undermined by the "consistent attitude" of the United States and Syngman Rhee, the US promise to discuss re-fighting with Syngman Rhee seems even more important. Since the United States has been prepared to move from "releasing" prisoners of war to a military alliance with Syngman Rhee, and from a military alliance to withdrawing from the political conference, and after withdrawing from the political conference, it will discuss resuming the war with Syngman Rhee, doesn't this clearly show that the United States and Syngman Rhee are preparing to re-ignite the war before the armistice is even realized?

The so-called "discussion" and "must be approved by the US Senate" in Robertson's plan are nothing but a smokescreen to try to deceive world opinion. Everyone knows that three years ago, Truman sent US troops to intervene in Korea without any "approval" from the US Congress in advance. The danger of the Korean armistice being undermined already exists realistically in these two plans.

From this exchange between the United States and Syngman Rhee, one can only get the impression that it is not the United States "persuading" Syngman Rhee, but that the United States and Syngman Rhee are plotting a new conspiracy and a new time bomb for ulterior motives.

    美国对李承晚步步采取纵容态度
    在朝鲜和平道路上埋下定时炸弹
    【新华社开城六日电】本社特派记者江南报道：朝鲜停战谈判已经中断十六天了，全世界舆论都在瞧着美国政府对于由于它对李承晚的纵容政策而造成的严重局势如何处理。罗伯逊今天已和李承晚举行了第十次会谈。美国政府说是要李承晚同意停战，但李承晚却得到了越来越多的破坏停战的鼓励；美国政府说是有诚意停战，但却纵容李承晚为停战埋下一颗又一颗的定时炸弹。
    美国在朝鲜和平的道路上埋设的第一颗定时炸弹，就是五月十三日美方在板门店提出的“反建议”。当时美方为了迁就李承晚的强迫扣留战俘的要求，推翻谈判恢复的基础，提出将不直接遣返的北朝鲜战俘在停战以后立即就地释放的无理主张。在全世界舆论的强烈抗议之下，美国不得不收回了这个无理的主张，同时却一只眼开一只眼闭地听任李承晚作好强迫扣留战俘的种种准备。
    在美方被迫修改它的“反建议”以后，李承晚匪帮就公开叫嚣反对停战，并且在南朝鲜制造了一系列的“反停战示威”。六月九日，李承晚的“国民议会”通过一项决议，要求“立即释放所有拒绝遣返的朝鲜战俘，并把拒绝回家的中国战俘送到台湾去”。随后，李承晚就积极进行准备。“纽约时报”驻汉城记者在六月十九日承认：“在若干时候以来，事情已经很清楚，即将要释放战俘。有几个报纸甚至早就发表消息说，几个有关的战俘营是由南朝鲜人担任警卫任务的，驻在那里的国家警察带着粮食和衣服，准备供给那些预定逃跑的战俘取用。同时，南朝鲜宪兵司令元容德曾指示战俘营附近的朝鲜人民，要和‘那些执行我的命令的军警充分合作’，去协助战俘的逃跑。”
    所有这一切，美方明明都是知道的，但是他们没有采取也不想采取任何措施来加以预防。到六月十八日，正当板门店充满着停战的希望的时候，美方在五月十三日埋下的定时炸弹爆炸了。李承晚在美国政府的纵容下，从战俘营里拉走了二万五千多名战俘。
    对于李承晚这种公然破坏战俘问题协议的行为，美方继续采取纵容的态度。接连几天，美方眼看着李承晚从战俘营里拉走大批战俘，直到战俘营差不多要空了的时候，才派美国军队去替换南朝鲜军队。接着，美方又眼看着李承晚强迫战俘参加李伪军。美方一方面向朝中方面说，他们将尽力追回被“释放”的战俘，另一方面却下令给美国宪兵，叫他们对于那些被南朝鲜警察押着在街上走的战俘“动也不许动一下”。
    李承晚显然从美方这种态度中受到了鼓励，他更加猖狂地叫嚣拒绝停战，除非美方答应先和他订立所谓“共同防御条约”，并且把政治会议期限限制为三个月。对于李承晚这种蛮干捣乱，美方不但没有运用它对李承晚的控制来制服李承晚，反而立刻和李承晚一起在朝鲜和平的道路上又埋下了一颗定时炸弹。罗伯逊到朝鲜以后的第三天，就答应和李承晚订立军事同盟。由于这个军事同盟要经过美国参议院的批准，需要相当长的时间，罗伯逊又顺从李承晚的心意，答应在缔结正式的军事同盟之前，先和李承晚订立一个临时协定，给予李承晚以军事上的保证。
    在这以后，李承晚一直坚持说，如果政治会议在三个月之内没有得出令他满意的统一朝鲜的办法，美国就应和他一起重新发动战争。对于这一点，美国方面虽然也曾放出过“碍难应允”的空气，但从汉城传出的消息说，罗伯逊已在讨论重新作战的问题了。
    据美联社汉城五日电透露，罗伯逊已提出了“两点折衷”方案：“（一）如果停战以后的政治会议在九十天完了时，对和平统一朝鲜问题没有进展，美国同意和南朝鲜一道退出政治会议。（二）在退出政治会议以后，美国愿意通过外交途径‘讨论’重新对共产党作战的问题。”美国方面据说把这两点折衷方案称之为“妙计”，但明眼人不难看出这种“妙计”就是对于李承晚破坏停战的罪恶活动的鼓励。
    十分明显，这个“两点折衷”方案，实际上就是又在朝鲜和平的前途上埋下两颗定时炸弹。就政治会议这一点来说，美方不但答应了李承晚的把政治会议限期为九十天的要求，而且更进了一步，同意和李承晚在政治会议上采取一致态度，并在达不到他们的目的时就一起退出政治会议。这样，美国就为政治会议预先规定了一个任务，这就是：在九十天之内同意美国和李承晚的要求。美国显然只是企图把政治会议当作达到他们破坏停战目的的工具，而不是有关各方共同协商解决问题的场所。罗伯逊的这一点方案，实际上就是企图由美国和李承晚来片面决定政治会议的前途，要挟参加政治会议的有关各方必须跟着美国和李承晚走，企图使政治会议在还没有召开之前就注定要遭受失败。
    既然政治会议必然要被美国和李承晚的“一致态度”所破坏，美国答应和李承晚讨论重新作战的这一点都显得更加重要了。美国既然已经准备与李承晚从“释放”战俘走到军事同盟，又从军事同盟走到退出政治会议，而退出政治会议之后，就要与李承晚商量恢复战争，这不是显然说明美国和李承晚在停战尚未实现之前就来准备重新爆发战争吗？
    罗伯逊的方案中的所谓“讨论”，所谓“必须经过美国参议院批准”，都不过是企图蒙蔽世界舆论的障眼法而已。谁都知道，三年以前，杜鲁门派遣美国军队干涉朝鲜，事先并没有经过美国国会的什么“批准”。朝鲜停战遭受破坏的危险，已经在这两点方案中现实地存在着了。
    从美国和李承晚之间这一段来往看来，只能给人们这样的印象：不是美国“说服”李承晚，而是美国与李承晚之间为着不可告人的目的，正在布置一种新的阴谋，一种新的定时炸弹。
