    Reply from the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company

    The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company writes: The situation reported by the Hengshui branch company regarding the lack of warehousing facilities is indeed a fact. The head office must take responsibility for this serious situation and should conduct a self-criticism. Because our understanding of the conditions of our subordinate units, especially the grassroots units, is insufficient, we cannot promptly and proactively provide more specific information for the higher authorities to consider as a basis for solving practical problems.

    The problem of a lack of warehousing facilities is a widespread issue within our professional system, and the situation is very serious. Over the past few months, we have conducted a relatively comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the lack of warehousing facilities across the country. We have now comprehensively reported this situation and the various equipment that must be added to the central Ministry of Commerce for unified consideration, and we request that effective measures be taken swiftly to ensure the safety of materials.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中国花纱布公司的答复
    中国花纱布公司来信：衡水支公司反映缺乏仓储设备的情况确系事实。对这种严重情况，总公司必须负责并应作检讨。由于我们对所属单位的情况，特别是对基层单位的情况了解得不够，因此不能及时而主动地提出更多的具体资料供上级考虑，以作为解决实际问题的依据。
    缺乏仓储设备问题在本专业系统中普遍存在，并且情况都很严重。几个月来我们对全国各地缺乏仓储设备的情况作了一次比较全面的深入的了解，现已将这种情形及必须增添的各种设备综合上报中央商业部统筹考虑，并请迅作有效措施，以保物资的安全。
