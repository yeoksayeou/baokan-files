    This is the Home of Korean Orphans
    By Bulanka Saiermakewa, Czechoslovakia
    The atrocities committed by the American invaders in Korea have caused countless Korean children – the flowers of humanity's future – to lose their parents, their families, and their warm lives. As a result, tens of thousands of Korean orphans have had to leave their homeland and seek the happiness of children among the friends of the Korean people.

    Like other people's democratic countries, the Czechoslovak government invited these Korean orphans to their country and built a warm and affectionate home for them, relieving them of the disasters and terrors they suffered in their war-torn homeland, and allowing these orphans to once again feel the warmth of family and the joy of childhood. Most of these children came from Pyongyang and Seoul, and some of them even participated in the battles to defend their country, proudly wearing Young Pioneer medals on their chests, symbols of their brave fight for their country's independence and freedom. They arrived in Czechoslovakia on May 1st of last year and now live in the former Hstejka spa area, located in Central Bohemia on the Elbe River, near Stara Boleslav, a place with beautiful scenery.

    In a vast park, there are two beautiful modern buildings, which in the past were places where bourgeois rulers used to relax and play, but now have become the new home for these two hundred Korean orphans. One large building houses an airy dining hall, a lounge, and classrooms. The other building houses the children's bedrooms. Everywhere looks very clean. The beds in the bedrooms are neatly arranged, and the clothes are folded like new. On the clean washbasins, toothbrushes, toothpaste, cups, and soap are neatly arranged. The girls' rooms are filled with dolls and other toys, while the boys' rooms contain notebooks, colored pencils, and drawings. The children are all lively, cheerful, and smiling.

    At six o'clock in the morning, when the alarm clock rings, the children get up. They quickly tidy their rooms and run out to gather on the playground to prepare for the flag-raising ceremony. They happily watch the Korean and Czechoslovak flags being raised to the top of the flagpole, singing the Czech song "Flying, the Flag is Flying High" in unison.

    After breakfast, they go to school in the nearby town of Brandýs. They sit with Czech children in the classroom. The Czech children help them learn Czech. Their intelligence, talent, wisdom, and hardworking qualities are praised by the Czech teachers.

    At noon, they line up in neat rows of five, led by their squad leader, and return to their dormitory. After lunch, they run in groups to the open space outside to play. At this time, the vast park is filled with the children's loud laughter. After a while, they run back to their "aunties" (their term for the Czech female teachers). It was here, when they saw us visitors, that they showed innocent and joyful smiles, warmly shook our hands, and congratulated us on our work successes. On a bench in the park sat their teacher, Comrade Brunzlova, who loudly read a passage from a textbook: "Prague is the capital of the Czechoslovak Republic..." Then a Korean girl followed, reciting the passage in fluent and correctly pronounced Czech. Although they have been in Czechoslovakia for less than a year, they can already understand and speak some Czech very well.

    In the afternoon, they go back to the classroom for more lessons. There, Korean teachers teach them their mother tongue, history, and social sciences. During the break between classes, they go to the dining hall for tea and then continue their studies. At this time, they discuss various subjects in Czech and Korean schools in groups, and also review some extracurricular assignments. At six o'clock in the afternoon, they gather again on the playground to lower the flags.

    Before dinner, in the dining room and lounge, the children talk to each other entirely in Czech. They had made an agreement to ensure that they spoke Czech for ten minutes every day and learned four new Czech words. This diligent study has yielded excellent results. You can hear that the ten-minute Czech chatter in the dining hall is as lively as their Korean conversations in the park at noon.

    After dinner, the scheduled time is for various games and activities. Depending on their different interests, some join the singing group, some join the music group, and some girls form handicraft groups. In addition to these activities, there are also reading activities with Korean and Czech books and group games. Before going to bed, the children have one hour of free time.

    At night, it is especially quiet and peaceful here. Looking out from the windows, the lights of the factories shine around the park, and the Czechoslovak workers are working for peace and a happy life. Far away from this land, on the Korean front, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting shoulder to shoulder, defending the peace and independence of Korea. The people of Czechoslovakia and Korea are closely united, fighting bravely to defend world peace and the happy lives of children all over the world. (Attached pictures)

    这里是朝鲜孤儿的家
    捷克斯洛伐克  布兰卡·赛尔玛可瓦
    美国侵略者在朝鲜制造的暴行，使得多少朝鲜儿童——这人类未来的花朵丧失了双亲，丧失了家庭和温暖的生活。于是成千成万的朝鲜孤儿就不得不远离他们的祖国到朝鲜人民的朋友中间去找寻儿童的幸福。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府和其他人民民主国家一样，邀请了这些朝鲜孤儿来到自己国家里，并为他们建立起一个温暖而亲切的家园，解除了他们在战火的祖国遭受的灾难和恐怖，使这些孤儿重新感到了家庭一样的温暖和童年的愉快。这些孩子们大部分是从平壤和汉城来的，其中有几个还参加过保卫祖国的战斗，他们的胸前骄傲地佩着少年游击队的奖章，这是他们为祖国的独立自由而勇敢战斗的标志。去年五月一日他们来到捷克斯洛伐克，现在他们住在先前的赫斯泰加温泉区，它就在易北河上的中波希米亚，靠近斯达拉波里斯拉夫，是一个风景佳丽的地方。
    在一个宽阔的公园里，有两幢漂亮的现代化的建筑物，过去这里曾经是资产阶级统治者们游憩玩乐的场所，而现在已经成为这二百名朝鲜孤儿的新的家园了。在一座宽大的房子里，有空气流畅的饭厅、休息室和教室。在另一座房子里是孩子们的寝室。这里到处都显得非常整洁。寝室里的床铺整齐地排列着，衣服摺得就像新的一样。在洁白的脸盆上，牙刷、牙膏、杯子和肥皂等盥洗用具整齐地排列着。女孩子的房间里摆有许多洋娃娃和其他玩具，在男孩子的房间，则放着练习本、彩色笔和图画，孩子们个个都是活泼愉快、笑容满面的。
    早上六点钟，闹钟响了的时候，孩子们起床了。他们很快地整理好房间，就跑出去集合在操场上，准备升旗。他们愉快地注视着高升到旗杆顶上的朝鲜和捷克斯洛伐克的国旗，齐声唱着“飘扬，旗帜在高空飘扬”的捷克歌曲。
    吃好早饭，他们就到附近的勃朗台斯地方的学校里去上课。他们在课堂里和捷克孩子们坐在一起。捷克孩子帮助他们学捷克文。他们的聪明、才能、智慧和勤劳的品质，使捷克教师们赞口不绝。
    中午，他们就五人一排地排着整齐的队伍，由小队长领着回宿舍去了。吃完了午饭，他们又一群一群地跑到外面的空场上去游戏。这时，宽阔的公园里不断地传来孩子们的响亮的欢笑声。一会儿，他们又跑回到他们“阿姨”（他们对捷克女教师的称呼）的身边。就在这里，当他们看到我们这些拜访者的时候，他们露出了天真的愉快的微笑，热烈地和我们握手，并且祝贺我们工作胜利。在公园里的长凳上，坐着他们的教师布伦斯洛娃同志，她高声地念着教科书中的课文：“布拉格是捷克斯洛伐克共和国的首都……”随后一个朝鲜女孩子就用流利而发音正确的捷克话跟着念。虽然他们来到捷克斯洛伐克还不满一年，但是他们已经能很好地理解和说一些捷克话了。
    午后，他们又到教室里去上课了。在那里，朝鲜教师教他们祖国的语文、历史，以及社会科学。在课间的休息时间，他们到饭厅去喝了茶以后，就又继续学习了。这时，他们分组讨论着捷克和朝鲜学校中的各门功课，也温习着一些课外作业。下午六点钟，他们重又集合在操场上去降旗。
    晚饭前，在餐厅里和休息室里，孩子们完全用捷克话相互交谈。他们曾经订过一个公约，要保证每天说十分钟的捷克话和学会四句新的捷克话。这种勤奋的学习得到了很好的成绩。你可以听到，在饭厅里十分钟的捷克话的漫谈，就和他们中午在公园里用朝鲜话交谈时一样地热烈。
    晚饭后，规定是各种游戏活动的时间。孩子们依照自己不同的爱好，有的参加了歌咏小组，有的参加了音乐小组，还有些女孩子组成了手工小组。在这些活动之外，有时还增加了阅读朝鲜和捷克书籍的活动和集体游戏。晚上睡觉以前，孩子们还有一个钟头的自由活动。
    夜晚，这里显得特别宁静和安定。从窗子里望出去，园子四周亮起了工厂的灯火，捷克斯洛伐克的工人们正在为和平、幸福的生活而劳动着。在远离这片土地的东方，在朝鲜前线，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军正在肩并肩地战斗着，保卫着朝鲜的和平与独立。捷克斯洛伐克和朝鲜两国人民，正紧密地团结在一起，为保卫世界和平与全世界儿童的幸福的生活而勇敢地斗争着。（附图片）
