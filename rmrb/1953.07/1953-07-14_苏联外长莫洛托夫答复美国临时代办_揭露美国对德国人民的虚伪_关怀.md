Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 12th: The Soviet Foreign Ministry today issued the following statement:

    On July 10th, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union, Mr. E. O’Shaughnessy, visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky and delivered a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov; the full text of the letter is as follows:

    "Your Excellency:

    I am instructed by the President to convey to you his deep concern regarding the present situation in the Soviet Zone of Germany and the increasing difficulties suffered by the inhabitants of that zone. The United States Government and people are particularly concerned about the steadily deteriorating food supply situation of the inhabitants of that zone, which was an important factor in the recent demonstrations against the local authorities.

    The United States has a long tradition of seeking to alleviate suffering from famine and disease wherever it may occur. As one of the occupying powers of Germany, my Government has a legitimate concern for the welfare of the German people. The dire need for assistance of the people of Eastern Germany has been brought to the attention of my Government by my country's High Commissioner for Germany and by Chancellor Adenauer.

    My Government, deeply concerned by this need, has decided to propose to the Soviet Union, as an occupying power, the distribution to the residents of East Germany of food valued at approximately $15 million, including grain, sugar, lard, soybean oil, and certain other items.

    Details regarding methods of distribution and points of delivery could be worked out by the staffs of our respective High Commissioners for Germany, and the U.S. authorities there would contact the Soviet authorities regarding this as soon as the Soviet Government has reached a decision on this matter.

    The Governments of the United Kingdom and France have been informed separately regarding this proposal.

    I trust that Your Excellency will advise me at your earliest convenience of the Soviet Government's acceptance of this proposal, so that the food shortages causing suffering to the residents of East Germany may be alleviated rapidly. To ensure that no time is lost during this emergency, initial shipments of food will begin immediately to the borders of Germany and the Berlin occupation zones.

    Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.

    E. O'Shaughnessy"

    On July 11th, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov replied to U.S. Chargé d'Affaires E. O'Shaughnessy's letter as follows:

    "Dear Chargé d'Affaires:

    In your letter of July 10th, you stated that the President of the United States is reportedly concerned about the food situation in eastern Germany, and that the U.S. government has allocated $15 million, preparing to transport various kinds of food for distribution among the residents of eastern Germany.

    I believe it is necessary to draw the attention of the U.S. government to the following points in this regard:

    It can be seen from your letter that the U.S. government's understanding of the situation in eastern Germany is inaccurate. This cannot be considered surprising, because as you said, information about East Germany comes from the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany and Bonn Chancellor Adenauer, who bear the main responsibility for the disruption of public order in eastern Berlin that you mentioned. If they had not dispatched a large number of hired special agents and criminals from the U.S. occupied zone of Berlin to the German Democratic Republic on June 17th to set fire to grain stores and other shops, attack personnel of government organs, etc., incidents of disturbance and disorder would not have occurred in Berlin at all.

    It can also be seen from your letter that the U.S. government decided to transport food worth $15 million without even consulting the government of the German Democratic Republic. At present, this kind of practice would be an insult even to the residents of a colony, let alone the German people and their legitimate democratic government.

    From this it is clear that the U.S. government has not shown any concern for the food supply of German residents in this matter, but has decided to play a propaganda trick, which has nothing in common with genuine concern for the real interests of the German people.

    I therefore request that you inform the U.S. government that, due to the solid friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet government has in the past helped German residents with food. If necessary in the future, the Soviet government is also prepared to provide the residents of the German Democratic Republic with all necessary food and other assistance, in accordance with the existing understanding between the Soviet Union and the government of the German Democratic Republic.

    Respectfully,
    Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov"

    苏联外长莫洛托夫答复美国临时代办
    揭露美国对德国人民的虚伪“关怀”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：苏联外交部今天发表声明如下：
    七月十日，美国驻苏联临时代办奥绍尼西拜访苏联外交部副部长安·扬·维辛斯基，向他递交致苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫的信件；信件全文如下：
    “阁下：
    我奉总统之命，向你转达他对德国苏占区目前情况及该区居民所遭受的日益增加的困难的深切关怀。美国政府及人民特别关怀该区居民的不断恶化的食物供应情况，这种情况曾经是最近反对地方当局的示威的重要因素。
    美国素有设法减轻任何地方发生的饥馑和疾病痛苦的传统。作为德国占领国之一，敝国政府对德国人民的福利有着正当的关怀。德国东部人民迫切需要援助的情况已由敝国驻德高级专员及阿登纳总理通知敝国政府。
    敝国政府对此种需要极为关切，特决定建议作为占领国的苏联向东德居民分配价值约一千五百万美元的食物，其中包括谷物、糖、猪油、豆油及若干其他物品。
    有关分配方法及交接地点的细节当可由双方驻德高级专员公署人员拟订，一俟苏联政府就此问题获致决定后，该处的美国当局即可就此向苏联当局接洽。
    关于此项建议已分别通知联合王国及法国政府。
    我相信阁下将尽速告我以苏联政府接受此项建议的音信，以便使东德居民遭受痛苦的食物缺乏情况得以迅速缓和。为了确保紧急期间不致迁延时日，第一批食物将立即开始运往德国及柏林占领区边界。
    阁下，请接受我最高的敬意。
    埃·奥绍尼西”
    七月十一日，苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫对美国临时代办奥绍尼西的信件答复如下：
    “可敬的代办先生：
    你在七月十日的信中说，美国总统据说对德国东部的食物情况表示关怀，并说美国政府已拨出一千五百万美元，准备运送若干种食物在德国东部居民中分配。
    我认为有必要就此促请美国政府注意下列几点：
    从你的信中可以看出美国政府对德国东部的情况了解不确。不能认为这是出乎意外的，因为如你所说，关于东德的消息是来自应对你所提到的柏林东部破坏公共秩序事件负主要责任的美国驻德高级专员和波恩总理阿登纳。如果六月十七日他们没有从柏林美占区派遣大批雇用的特务和犯罪分子到德意志民主共和国来纵火焚烧粮食店和其他商店，攻击政府机关的人员等等的话，柏林原来是根本不会发生骚乱秩序的事件的。
    从你的信中也可以看出，美国政府甚至没有征询德意志民主共和国政府的意见就决定运送价值达一千五百万美元的食物。在目前，这种做法甚至对殖民地的居民都会是一种侮辱，更不用说德国人民和他们的合法的民主政府。
    由此可见，美国政府在这个问题上并没有表现什么对德国居民的食物供应的关怀，而是决定玩宣传上的花样，这和对德国人民真正利益的关怀毫无共同之处。
    我因此要求你通知美国政府，由于苏联与德意志民主共和国之间的巩固的友好关系，苏联政府过去曾以食物帮助德国居民。将来如果有需要的话，苏联政府也准备根据苏联和德意志民主共和国政府之间现有的谅解，给德意志民主共和国的居民以一切必要的食物援助及其他援助。
        维·米·莫洛托夫谨复”
