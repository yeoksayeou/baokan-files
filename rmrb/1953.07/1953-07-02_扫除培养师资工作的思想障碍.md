    Eliminating Ideological Obstacles in Teacher Training
    Tangshan Railway Institute Structural Theory Teaching and Research Group
    Since January 1953, our teaching and research group has been exploring the work of teacher training. Recently, we have discovered some methods. That is, to do this work well, we must eliminate all kinds of ideological obstacles.
    Our training objects are teaching assistants. The situation of these teaching assistants is: they have preliminary political awareness and have just completed intensive study of Russian; however, they have received a long period of old education, and at most have only one year of teaching assistant work experience. Their basic theory is still poor, especially lacking the ability to independently think, summarize and research problems. For these teaching assistants, correct methods must be adopted to cultivate them before they can teach courses within a certain period.
    However, we have a very poor understanding of this point. Initially, we regarded teacher training as purely business training, ignoring the fact that improving thinking is the decisive factor in improving teaching quality. After the education of the Party, especially after studying the introduction to the Soviet textbook on structural theory, we preliminarily realized that to truly master science and technology, we must master dialectical materialism, thereby making us more specifically aware of the primary significance of improving thinking.
    Regarding the proportion of Russian learning, some comrades believe that we should first be proficient in Russian, so that everything can be obtained without effort. After research, everyone realized that striving to improve the Russian language level is extremely important, but learning Russian does not mean having everything. Therefore, Russian language advanced study and business advanced study must maintain an appropriate ratio. In the case where translation tasks are particularly prominent this year, improving the Russian language level must be closely integrated with translation tasks.
    In terms of business training, everyone's views are even more inconsistent. The structural theory course offered by our teaching and research group is a course that can only be studied after students have studied general basic courses in the first year of university, such as calculus and physics, and then studied theoretical mechanics and material mechanics. Among them, especially theoretical mechanics and material mechanics, are the basics of structural theory. Since the adoption of Soviet textbooks, because teaching assistants were trained under the old education system, their mastery of the course is not enough (mainly because what they learned in the past was not systematic, they could not grasp the basic concepts, and they only knew some dead methods), so their understanding of the new textbook, and helping students and inspiring students to think from basic concepts also appeared difficult. This made the teaching assistants have a "long-term plan, starting from scratch" idea. However, to "start from scratch" requires a lot of time, and the current teaching tasks are quite heavy, so some people feel that there is a lot of work, heavy tasks, and little time, so it is impossible to train, which puts teacher training in opposition to current teaching work. Later, after repeated research, it was believed that the things learned in the past should not be completely negated, and basic theories that must be in the structural theory course should be appropriately sorted out and supplemented in the process of performing teaching tasks; however, the contradiction between training teaching assistants and performing current teaching tasks in terms of time has not been resolved. In this way, in the process of practice, some teaching assistants compress lesson preparation time, reluctantly cope with teaching, and isolatedly study basic theory. As a result, the quality of teaching is reduced, and even the minimum teaching requirements cannot be met; and teaching assistants, due to a lack of necessary independent advanced study ability, advanced study is also restricted. This is the bad result of separating from teaching and one-sidedly emphasizing studying basic courses. Experience tells us that if we do not correctly estimate the actual level of teaching assistants and the current teaching situation, it will inevitably cause a contradiction between teacher training and teaching. In this way, neither can the teaching task be completed, nor can the purpose of teacher training be achieved, because the result of teaching assistants being separated from teaching is that students have opinions, and the teaching assistants' mental burden is heavy, which will inevitably affect their advanced study.
    Therefore, under the current conditions, teacher training must be combined with teaching, so that teaching assistants can start from mastering the basic viewpoints of the structural theory course, gradually and practically master basic theory, learn the method of independently studying problems, and initially become familiar with teaching and tutoring methods. This is a practical method of teacher training.
    Some professors have wrong views on training teaching assistants. They believe that the so-called training of teaching assistants is to assign some books and let the teaching assistants study them alone without leadership. Some professors simply train teaching assistants in teaching methods, which is also one-sided. Doing so can formally enable the teaching assistants to complete the task of teaching, but it cannot enable the teaching assistants to guarantee the quality of teaching. Some comrades simply emphasize improving the teaching assistants' business theoretical level and ignore the training in teaching methods. They do not know that business theoretical knowledge must be well imparted to students through scientific teaching methods. Therefore, ignoring the training of teaching assistants in teaching methods is also wrong.
    Some comrades say that teacher training is an advanced Soviet method and can only be done by Soviet experts. Our school does not have Soviet experts, so we cannot train. This is an idea of not wanting to overcome difficulties. In fact, as long as we study the experience of Soviet experts guiding this work well, study the situation of our own school well, and unite all forces, then the work of training teaching assistants can still be carried out.
    Some teaching assistants say: "Under the conditions of using new textbooks, professors and I are about the same, and they cannot guide me." This kind of teaching assistant completely ignores the professors' business foundation and shows arrogance. They do not understand that the training of teaching assistants must rely on the united efforts of all members of the teaching and research group. Only when teaching assistants humbly learn from professors can they better improve themselves.
    The teacher training work of our teaching and research group is carried out in the process of continuously eliminating the above-mentioned ideological obstacles.

    扫除培养师资工作的思想障碍
    唐山铁道学院结构理论教研组
    从一九五三年一月起，我们教研组就在摸索着进行培养师资的工作，最近已经摸出一些门路，这就是，要搞好这项工作，必须扫清各种各样的思想障碍。
    我们教研组的培养对象是助教。这些助教的情况是：具有初步的政治觉悟，刚刚突击学习了俄文；但他们受了长时间的旧教育，最多的也只有一年的助教工作经验，基础理论还较差，尤其缺乏独立思考、归纳研究问题的能力。对于这样一些助教，必须采取正确的方法加以培养，才能够在一定时间内开课。
    但是，我们对这一点了解得很差。最初，我们把师资培养看作单纯的业务上的培养，忽略了提高思想乃是提高教学质量的决定性因素。经过党的教育，特别是学习了苏联教材结构理论的绪论，我们初步体会到要真正掌握科学技术，就必须掌握辩证唯物主义，从而使我们比较具体地认识了提高思想的首要意义。
    关于俄文学习的比重问题，有的同志认为应该先精通俄文，这样一切东西就可以不取自得了。经过研究，大家认识到努力提高俄文水平固然极其重要，但是学会俄文不等于就有了一切。因此，俄文进修和业务进修必须保持适当的比例。而在今年翻译任务特别突出的情况下，提高俄文水平又必须和翻译任务密切结合起来。
    在业务培养方面，大家的看法更不一致了。我们教研组所开的结构理论课，是在学生学过了大学一年级的一般基础课，如微积分、物理，又学了理论力学和材料力学以后才能学习的课程。其中，特别是理论力学和材料力学，是结构理论这门课程的基本。自从改用苏联教材以来，因为助教是在老一套教育制度下培养出来的，他们对于课程的掌握很不够（主要是过去所学的东西不成体系，抓不住基本概念，只会一些死方法），所以对于新教材的体会，对于由基本概念着手帮助同学，启发同学思考也就表现得吃力。这就使助教们产生了一种“百年大计，从头干起”的想法。但是要“从头干起”，就需要很多的时间，而目前的教学任务又相当繁重，于是有人觉得，目前工作多，任务重，时间少，无法培养，这就把培养师资和当前的教学工作对立起来了。后来经过反复研究，认为不应把以前学的东西一概否定掉，应当在执行教学任务的过程中，适当地整理补充关于结构理论课中所必须的基本理论；但是培养助教和执行当前教学任务在时间方面的矛盾仍然没有解决。这样，在实践的过程中，有的助教就压缩备课时间，勉强应付教学，孤立地去钻研基础理论。其结果，降低了教学质量，甚至不能满足最起码的教学要求；而助教由于缺乏必要的独立进修能力，进修也受到了限制，这就是脱离教学，片面强调钻研基础课程的不良结果。经验告诉我们，如果不去正确地估计助教的实际水平和目前教学情况，就必然造成培养师资和教学之间的矛盾，这样，既不能完成教学任务，又达不到培养师资的目的，因为助教脱离教学的结果，同学有意见，助教的精神负担就大，这就必然影响他们的进修。
    因此，在现在的条件下，培养师资必须和教学结合起来，使助教从掌握结构理论课程的基本论点入手，逐步切实地掌握基础理论，学会独立研究问题的方法，并初步熟悉教学和辅导的方法，这才是切合实际的培养师资的办法。
    有的教授对于培养助教的看法是错误的。他们认为所谓培养助教就是指定一些书籍，让助教去单钻，而不加领导。有的教授就单纯在教学方法上培养助教，这也是片面的。这样作，形式上可以使助教完成上课的任务，但是却不能使助教保证教课的质量。有的同志就单纯地强调提高助教的业务理论水平，而把教学方法上的培养置之不顾。他们不知道，业务理论知识必须通过科学的教学方法，才能很好地传授给同学。因此忽视在教学方法上培养助教，也是错误的。
    有的同志说，培养师资是苏联的先进方法，必须苏联专家才能作，我们学校没有苏联专家，因此不能培养。这是一种不愿克服困难的想法。事实上，只要很好地学习苏联专家指导这一工作的经验，好好研究自己学校的情况，并把一切力量团结起来，那末培养助教的工作仍然是可以进行的。
    有的助教说：“在使用新教材的条件下，教授和我差不多，他们不能指导我。”这种助教完全忽视了教授的业务基础，表现了自高自大。他们不了解，助教的培养，必须依靠教研组全体成员团结一致的努力才有可能，助教们也只有在虚心向教授学习的情况下，才能更好地提高自己。
    我们教研组的师资培养工作就是在不断扫除上述思想障碍的情况下展开的。
