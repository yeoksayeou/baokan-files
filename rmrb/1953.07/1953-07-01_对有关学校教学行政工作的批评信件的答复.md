Column: Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions

    Responses to Letters of Criticism Regarding School Teaching and Administrative Work

    The "Reader's Letters Summary" column has successively published letters from readers criticizing shortcomings in the teaching and administrative work of some schools. We now publish below summaries of response letters from relevant units:

    Northeast Commercial College sent a letter responding to the reader's criticism in this newspaper on May 29th regarding the unclear teaching policy of the college's Russian Department. The letter stated that the purpose of establishing the Russian Department at the college was to cultivate translation talent for state-owned trade. One of the guiding principles of the teaching plan is to focus on learning basic Russian, appropriately combined with commercial business courses. Because the current incoming freshmen generally have either never learned Russian or have learned very little, and the three-year period is limited, too many specialized courses cannot be set up, so as not to hinder the learning of basic Russian. However, the college did not adequately publicize this policy to students in the past, and the Russian textbooks for second-year students and above were indeed not sufficiently integrated with commercial business. The college now has three years of teaching experience, and the teaching staff is relatively mature, and is now starting to compile some teaching materials combined with trade business. In addition, the letter also stated that the teachers of the college's Russian Department, in addition to teaching Russian to ten classes in the department, also teach Russian to twenty-eight undergraduate classes in other departments of the college. The workload is relatively heavy, and there is no phenomenon of too many teachers.

    Regarding the reader's criticism on May 12th that "Beijing Industrial School's school-running policy is unclear," the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government stated in a letter: "Now the Education Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee is conducting the adjustment of secondary technical schools in the North China region, and the plan will be decided soon. After the adjustment, this situation can be improved."

    Shandong University sent a letter responding to the reader's criticism in this newspaper on May 12th regarding the excessive number of administrative staff at the university. The letter stated: "The reader's criticism is basically correct, except for a few examples that are not quite appropriate (such as the two deans of studies and three chief secretaries being teachers concurrently serving as administrative staff, not full-time administrative personnel). After the adjustment of departments in the summer of 1952, a group of cadres was transferred out; at that time, a group of administrative staff was absorbed in preparation for the independence of the medical college. Because we only emphasized the needs of the work, and the investigation and research were insufficient when using manpower, and we failed to strictly grasp it, resulting in an excessive number of administrative personnel and some waste of manpower. Regarding this issue, during the school-wide work inspection at the beginning of this semester, the school's administrative leadership and personnel department have conducted inspections and planned to request instructions on how to solve it. Now the East China Higher Education Administration has also put forward criticisms and instructions to our school. In addition to sincerely accepting them, we have initially studied the staffing of the medical college's administrative personnel and the deployment opinions of personnel in other affiliated units of the school, and plan to request instructions from the East China Higher Education Administration for approval before implementation."

    Regarding the reader's criticism on March 27th that "Northeast Institute of Technology should not arbitrarily transfer students in school to participate in administrative work," the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government sent a letter, reviewing the procrastinating attitude of failing to reply in time, and explaining the ministry's handling opinions on this issue. The letter stated: "Although the Northeast Institute of Technology has transferred students to participate in work several times due to work needs and with the consent of the former Northeast Industry Department and the Ministry of Personnel, it did not appropriately strengthen teaching work when using them, and the training and education of those who were transferred was poor. The school should bear the main responsibility for this; our ministry lacks regular understanding of the school's transfer of students and should also conduct a good inspection. Now the adjustment of those who have been transferred from the school has begun or they have been transferred back to continue their studies. However, in order to avoid affecting the work due to immediate comprehensive adjustments, this issue remains to be resolved gradually."

### 对有关学校教学行政工作的批评信件的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对有关学校教学行政工作的批评信件的答复
    “读者来信摘要”栏先后发表了一些读者批评某些学校教学行政工作中缺点的来信，现将有关单位的答复信摘要发表于后：
    东北商业专科学校来信，对五月二十九日本报读者批评该校俄文系教学方针不明确的问题作了答复。来信说明该校俄文系设系目的在于培养国营贸易的翻译人材。教学计划的方针之一是以学习基础俄语为主，适当结合商业业务课。因为目前入学新生一般都是根本未学过俄文或学得很少的，三年时间又有限，故不能过多设置专业课程，以免妨碍基础俄语的学习。但该校过去向学生宣传这一方针不够，同时二年级以上的俄文读本教材结合商业业务也的确不够。目前该校已有了三年教学经验，教师条件也较成熟，正着手编一部分结合贸易业务的教材。此外，来信中又说明该校俄文系教师除了担任本系十个班的俄文课以外，还担任本校其他各系本科二十八个班的俄文课，工作都较繁重，并无教员过多现象。
    对于五月十二日读者批评“北京工业学校办学方针不明确”的问题，中央高等教育部来信说：“现在华北行政委员会教育局正在进行华北区中等技术学校的调整工作，方案不久即可决定。经调整后这种情况就可得到改善。”
    山东大学来信，对五月十二日本报读者批评该校行政工作人员过多的问题作了答复。来信说：“读者批评，除有个别例子举得不够恰当外（如教务长二人、主任秘书三人均是教员兼职，并非专任行政人员），基本精神是正确的。我校在一九五二年暑期院系调整后，调出一批干部；当时为了准备医学院独立，就吸收了一批行政工作人员。由于我们只强调工作的需要，使用人力时调查研究不够，未能严格的掌握，形成行政人员过多和某些浪费人力现象。对此问题，在本学期初进行全校工作检查时，我校行政领导方面与人事部门已做过检查，并拟请示设法解决。现华东高等教育管理局又对我校提出了批评和指示。我们除诚恳接受外，已初步研究出医学院行政人员的配备及本校其他附设单位人员的调配意见，拟请示华东高等教育管理局批准后执行。”
    对三月二十七日读者批评“东北工学院不该任意抽调在学学生参加行政工作”的问题，中央高等教育部来信，检讨了未能及时答复的拖拉态度，并说明了该部对这问题的处理意见。来信说：“东北工学院数次抽调学生参加工作，虽系因工作需要并经原东北工业部和人事部同意，但在使用时没有适当加强教学工作，并对被抽调者培养教育较差。该校对此应负主要责任；我部对学校抽调学生的情况缺乏经常了解，也应该很好检查。现在该校被抽调者已开始调整工作或调回继续学习。但为了避免因立刻全面调整而影响工作，这个问题尚待逐步解决。”
