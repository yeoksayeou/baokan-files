On the Consistency of Learning and Application in the Unified Job Assignment of Higher Education Graduates
Ding Hua

In the past three years, more than 74,000 graduates from China's higher education institutions have been assigned to various national work posts under the planned distribution of the Central People's Government. They have been tempered in their work and have generally made great progress politically, ideologically, and professionally, playing a significant role in various national construction efforts. This summer, more than 34,000 graduates will participate in national construction work under the unified assignment of the Central People's Government. In the future, more higher education graduates will be joining the various national work posts each year.

In old China, the fate of the vast majority of higher education graduates was unemployment. In new China, the status of intellectuals has undergone a fundamental change. The Central People's Government now plans and unifies the distribution of jobs for higher education graduates, a contingent of intellectuals with specific knowledge and skills, enabling them to play a tremendous role in the nation's various construction endeavors. It goes without saying that the phenomenon of "graduation equals unemployment" in old China is gone forever.

In the past few years, in the unified job assignment of higher education graduates, one issue has been of utmost concern to graduating students and has also received the most attention from the People's Government: the issue of "consistency of learning and application." The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has repeatedly issued clear directives to implement the principle of "consistency of learning and application" in the unified job assignment of graduates. For example, in the "Instructions on Several Issues in Adjusting the Work of Higher Education Graduates" issued in June 1952, it was emphasized that necessary adjustments should be made to address the issue of "inconsistent learning and application," where some graduates' work is not in line with their education due to departmentalism and one-sided emphasis on work needs by certain units. Students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine should be particularly firmly adjusted. Based on this instruction, personnel departments and business departments at all levels have constantly paid attention to and adjusted situations where higher education graduates' learning and application are inconsistent. From November of last year to June of this year alone, the Central Personnel Department adjusted 42 higher education graduates assigned to various central departments due to inconsistency in learning and application. This shows that the People's Government attaches great importance to and resolutely implements the principle of consistency of learning and application.

It is understood that the majority of higher education graduates have a correct understanding and good performance in obeying the unified national assignment due to their continuous improvement in political awareness. However, some people lack a comprehensive and correct understanding of the issue of consistency of learning and application, and therefore cannot correctly treat the work assigned to them by the government. At the same time, most personnel departments and business departments have handled the work of higher education graduates in accordance with the spirit of the Government Administration Council's instructions, but some departments, in the specific allocation of higher education graduates, either commit the problem of departmentalism, one-sidedly emphasizing work needs and ignoring the principle of consistency of learning and application, leaving graduates who are not suitable for work in their departments to work in their departments; or commit the problem of bureaucracy, failing to carefully study the graduates' learning and the needs of the business, and blindly assigning work. These erroneous understandings and problems in work are serious obstacles to the implementation of the principle of consistency of learning and application, and the People's Government must pay attention to checking and correcting them at any time in order to better implement the principle of consistency of learning and application.

This summer, the allocation of graduates from national higher education institutions is underway. It is timely to discuss the issue of consistency of learning and application now for the reference of graduating students and relevant departments.

How should we understand the issue of consistency of learning and application?

I believe that the issue of consistency of learning and application must be understood in connection with the issue of serving the people. That is to say, the issue of consistency of learning and application must be considered on the premise of serving the people, and the principle of consistency of learning and application is subordinate to the higher principle of serving the people. The reason why we require the realization of the principle of "consistency of learning and application" in the allocation of higher education graduates is because only in this way can they serve the people more effectively. But it should also be pointed out that the understanding of the principle of "consistency of learning and application" cannot be separated from the foundation of our country's construction needs. Therefore, the "Instructions on the Unified Allocation of National Higher Education Graduates for the Summer of 1952" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government clearly stated that the principle of consistency of learning and application must be implemented "on the basis of adapting to the needs of national construction." To explain this issue, it is necessary to compare the current situation of higher education in our country with the needs of our country's construction work for cadres. Our country has begun planned construction work and needs a large number of specialized talents of all kinds with the spirit of serving the people and with advanced knowledge and technology; however, the vast majority of our higher education institutions are transformed from old higher education institutions. Although the department settings have generally been adjusted and the teaching content is being transformed, the residual influence of the old education system cannot be completely overcome in a short period of time. Therefore, at present, especially in the past few years, there is still an unavoidable distance between higher education graduates and the needs of national construction. For example, the department settings and enrollment ratios of the old higher education institutions were blind and unplanned, which are not adapted to the actual needs of our national construction today. This influence of the old higher education makes the supply-demand relationship between the number of graduates from each department of higher education and the needs of national construction still imbalanced: the number of graduates from some departments is far behind the needs of construction, and even some talents urgently needed for construction have not been cultivated by the relevant departments set up by the higher education institutions in the past; the number of graduates from some departments, however, exceeds the needs of construction at present. On the other hand, due to the variety of types of work and the complexity of technology in our country's construction cause, especially the industrial construction cause, the division of labor is detailed, and various professional talents are needed; however, the graduates trained by higher education institutions at present are not specialized enough, and they cannot fully meet the requirements of the detailed division of labor in national construction work.

Therefore, in the allocation work, it is necessary to deal with it according to the following three situations:

The first situation. At present, the number of graduates from certain departments in higher education institutions is in short supply for the urgent needs of certain departments in national construction. What should be done in this situation? We believe that for the needs of national construction, it is necessary to allocate graduates with similar departments to replace and undertake the urgent tasks of construction. For example, resources exploration, river port engineering, non-ferrous metal smelting, water supply and drainage, heating and ventilation engineering, etc. At present, some universities in our country have not set up departments to cultivate talents in these areas, and some of the graduates in these areas are too few, while the construction of these projects is very urgent, so it is possible to assign physics students to do physical exploration work, civil engineering and hydraulic engineering students to do river port engineering, chemical engineering students to do non-ferrous metal smelting, and mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and architectural engineering students to do heating and ventilation. This is relatively reasonable, and it has been proven to be correct in actual work. Just like the Huai River project, a large number of hydraulic engineering talents are needed, but the number of graduates from the hydraulic engineering department of higher education institutions is limited and cannot meet the requirements. Therefore, the People's Government allocated a considerable number of civil engineering graduates to participate in the Huai River project, which ensured the smooth progress of the project. Other examples include assigning some finance and finance and banking graduates to work as cost accountants in enterprise departments in financial work; and assigning some horticulture graduates to engage in soil fertilizer and plant pest and disease work in agriculture, which have also achieved good results.

The second situation. A very small number of departments in higher education institutions have more graduates than needed for the country's current needs. For example, before China's shipping industry developed, it was difficult to achieve consistency in learning and application in the allocation of graduates from the marine engineering and ship driving departments, and the transportation department could only allocate work according to the specific situation. However, this situation will only be temporary. In the future, China's shipping industry will gradually develop, and at that time, graduates from the marine engineering and ship driving departments will be able to play a better role.

The third situation. Because of the variety of types of work and the complexity of technology in the country's construction cause, the division of labor is detailed, and therefore various professional talents are needed. However, the graduates trained by higher education institutions are not specialized enough. For the requirements of the detailed division of labor in national construction, even if they learn that line and do that line, it is difficult to adapt at the beginning. Here, not only does it reflect the general problem that there is a certain distance between learning and application, that is, between theory and practice, but it also reflects the particular problem that there is a certain distance between the residual influence of old education in our country and the needs of national construction. For example, a machine factory can be divided into casting, pressure processing (i.e., forging and stamping), metallographic heat treatment, welding, metal cutting, tool, assembly and other workshops to carry out work. For example, the power work of a factory is divided into boiler, lighting, power generation, power transmission, heat, substation, inspection and maintenance groups to carry out work. A graduate of an ordinary mechanical engineering department participates in the work of a mechanical factory, and a graduate of the power group of the mechanical engineering department (or the electrical engineering department) engages in power work. No matter which department they work in, it is difficult for them to be competent and happy at the beginning. Their work belongs to "what they learn, what they do," which is in line with the principle of consistency of learning and application, but they will still feel that there is a distance between learning and application. They may think that this is inconsistency of learning and application. This understanding is incorrect. They should cherish the foundation they learned in higher education institutions and strengthen their learning in actual work. This is the only correct way.

There is also another one-sided understanding of the issue of consistency of learning and application. For example, a graduate of the mechanical engineering department (taking graduates of any other department as an example) can do work in many aspects, such as production department, planning department, education department, business administration department, and basic construction design, construction, etc. Taking the production department alone, it is also necessary to divide it into production technology, planning work, technical security, technical education, and production management. However, some people think that only working in a factory or engaging in production technology work in a factory is in line with the principle of consistency of learning and application. This is also a one-sided understanding of the principle of consistency of learning and application, which shows that they have not understood the principle of consistency of learning and application from the overall perspective of national construction. Here, it may not only be a problem of one-sidedness in the understanding of the consistency of learning and application, but it may also contain some personal plans, reflecting that some people still cannot correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and national interests.

Some people, in basic construction work, only want to engage in design work, or emphasize that they focused on design when they were studying at school, or say that they are interested in design and do not want to engage in construction work. This is also wrong.

The above explanations and examples make us realize that at present, it is unrealistic to require that the work of higher education graduates fully meet the standard of consistency of learning and application. It is an isolated view that deviates from the needs of national construction. For the principle of consistency of learning and application, we can only make relatively different degrees of requirements according to the specific situation of national needs, and we cannot make excessively high requirements mechanically and one-sidedly. If we understand the principle of consistency of learning and application mechanically and one-sidedly, and act according to this understanding, the result will inevitably hinder our country's construction plan, or force some of our country's construction work to be suspended. Obviously, no one will agree with this erroneous practice of making national interests subordinate to personal interests.

The People's Government implements the principle of consistency of learning and application in the work of allocating higher education graduates. Its actual practice is to make reasonable allocations based on the needs of national construction and the specific circumstances of higher education graduates. The result of doing so guarantees that the work assigned to the vast majority of graduates can meet the principle of consistency of learning and application, so that they can happily accept the work assigned by the government.

The work of unified allocation of higher education graduates should "implement the principle of consistency of learning and application on the basis of adapting to the needs of national construction." This instruction is completely correct. It is hoped that the graduating students of higher education institutions and all relevant departments can correctly understand this instruction and implement it in practice!

    谈高等学校毕业生统一分配工作中的学和用的一致问题
    丁华
    三年来，我国高等学校的毕业生，约有七万四千多人已由中央人民政府有计划地分配到国家的各种工作岗位上。他们在工作中得到了锻炼，在政治上、思想上和业务上，一般地都有了很大的进步，在国家的各种建设中，起着重大的作用。今年暑期，将有毕业生三万四千多人，在中央人民政府统一分配之下，参加国家建设工作。今后每年将有更多的高等学校毕业生走上国家的各种工作岗位。
    在旧中国，绝大多数高等学校毕业生的命运是失业。在新中国，知识分子的地位起了根本的变化，高等学校毕业生这一支具有一定专门知识和技能的知识分子队伍，由政府有计划地统一分配工作，在祖国的各种建设工作中发挥着巨大的作用。不用说，旧中国那种“毕业即失业”的现象是一去不复返了。
    几年来，在对高等学校毕业生的统一分配工作中，有一个问题是毕业同学们最关心、也是人民政府最注意的，那就是“学用一致”的问题。中央人民政府政务院对毕业生的统一分配，一再明确指示要贯彻“学用一致”的原则，如在一九五二年六月所发“关于调整高等学校毕业生工作中几个问题的指示”中就强调指出过：对在分配工作中，由于某些单位的本位主义，片面强调工作需要，致使有一部分毕业生的工作，是学非所用，用非所学者，应进行必要的调整；其中属于理、工、农、医各科系的学生，尤应坚决地加以调整。根据这一指示，近一年来，各级人事部门和各业务部门，对于高等学校毕业生学用不一致的情形，不断地注意检查，并进行了调整。仅就分配到中央一级各部门的高等学校毕业生，因学用不一致，经中央人事部予以调整者，自去年十一月至今年六月，即有四十二人。这说明，人民政府是十分重视和坚决贯彻执行学用一致的原则的。
    据了解，多数的高等学校毕业生由于政治觉悟的不断提高，对于服从国家统一分配有着正确的认识和良好的表现，但也有些人对于学用一致的问题，缺乏全面的、正确的理解，因而也就不能正确地对待政府分配给他们的工作。同时，多数人事部门和业务部门确已根据政务院指示的精神处理高等学校毕业生的工作问题，但也有一些部门，在具体分配高等学校毕业生的工作中，或是犯了本位主义的毛病，片面强调工作需要，忽视学用一致的原则，把不适于在本部门工作的毕业生留在本部门工作；或是犯了官僚主义的毛病，不细心研究毕业生的所学和业务的需要，盲目地分配工作。这些错误的认识和工作中的毛病，都是贯彻学用一致的原则的严重障碍，人民政府不能不随时注意检查纠正，以便更好地贯彻执行学用一致的原则。
    今年暑期全国高等学校毕业生的分配工作正在进行，现在把学用一致的问题提出来谈谈，以供毕业同学们和有关部门参考。
    关于学用一致的问题，我们应该怎样来认识呢？
    我以为，学用一致的问题，是必须和为人民服务的问题联系在一起来认识的。那也就是说，必须放在为人民服务的前提下来考虑学用一致的问题，学用一致的原则，是服从于为人民服务的更高原则的。我们所以要求在高等学校毕业生分配工作中实现“学用一致”的原则，也就是因为只有这样，才能使他们更有效地为人民服务。但也应该指出，认识“学用一致”这一原则，不能脱离我们国家建设需要的基础。所以，中央人民政府政务院“关于一九五二年暑期全国高等学校毕业生统筹分配工作的指示”中曾明确提出，必须“在适应国家建设需要的基础上贯彻学用一致的原则”。要说明这个问题，把我们国家目前高等教育的情况和我们国家建设工作需要干部的情况比较一下是必要的。我们国家已开始有计划的建设工作，需要大量的具有为人民服务的精神的、具有先进知识和技术的各种各样的专门人才；但是，我们的高等学校绝大部分是旧的高等学校改造的，它的科系设置虽然一般已进行调整，教学内容等等还正在进行改造，所以，旧教育制度的残余影响，在短时期内还不能克服净尽。因此，在目前，特别在过去几年当中，高等学校毕业生和国家建设需要之间，不可避免地还存在着一定的距离。例如旧的高等学校的科系设置和各科系的招生比例，都是盲目的、无计划的，对于我们今天国家建设的实际需要来说，是不相适应的。旧的高等教育这种影响，使今天高等学校各科系毕业生的人数和国家建设需要之间的供求关系上，还存在着不均衡的现象：有的科系的毕业生人数远赶不上建设的需要，甚至有些建设上急需的人才，过去的高等学校并没有设置有关的科系来培养；有的科系的毕业生人数，在目前却又超过建设的需要。另一方面，由于我们国家的建设事业，特别是工业建设事业，工种繁多，技术复杂，因而分工细致，需要各种各样的专业人才；但是，目前高等学校培养出来的毕业生，由于所学的东西不够专门，对于国家建设工作分工细致的要求来说，也是不能完全相适应的。
    所以，在分配工作中，便不能不根据以下三种情况来处理：
    第一种情况。目前高等学校中某些科系的毕业人数对国家建设中某些部门的迫切需要来说是供不应求的。在这种情形之下，应该怎么办呢？我们认为：为了国家建设的需要，就必须分配那些科系相近的毕业生来代替，承担起建设上的迫切任务。例如：资源勘察、河港工程、有色金属冶炼、上下水道、暖气通风等工程，在目前我国高等学校中有的尚未设置科系来培养这方面的人才，有的这方面的毕业生太少，而这些工程的建设又是十分迫切的，所以就可以分配物理系学生搞物理探矿工作，土木系、水利系学生搞河港工程，化工系学生搞有色金属冶炼，机械系、土木系、建筑系学生搞暖气通风。这样作是比较合理的，而且这在实际工作中证明是正确的了。就像治淮工程，需要大量的水利工程人才，但高等学校水利系的毕业生为数有限，不能满足要求。于是人民政府分配了相当大量的土木系毕业生去参加治淮，这就保证了工程的顺利进行。其它如在财经工作方面，分配一部分财政系、财政金融系的毕业生到企业部门作成本会计工作；在农业方面，分配一部分园艺系毕业生搞土壤肥料和植物病虫害工作，也都收到了好的效果。
    第二种情况。高等学校中有极少部分科系的毕业生，对于国家今天的需要来说，却是超过需要的。例如：轮机科、轮船驾驶科的毕业生，在我国海运事业未发展以前，在分配工作上，就很难做到学用一致，只能由交通部门按具体情况来分配工作。但这种情况只会是暂时的，今后我国的海运事业是会逐渐发展起来的，到那时，轮机科、轮船驾驶科的毕业生就会更好地发挥作用了。
    第三种情况。因为国家的建设事业的工种繁多，技术复杂，分工细致，因而需要各种各样的专业人才，而高等学校毕业生所学的东西不够专，对于国家建设分工细致的要求来说，即使是学那行，干那行，一开始也是很难适应的。这里，不仅反映了学和用之间即理论和实践之间存在着一定距离的一般性的问题，而且反映了我国旧教育的残余影响和国家建设需要之间存在着一定距离的特殊性的问题。例如：一个机械工厂，可以分铸造、压力加工
    （即锻造和冲压）、金相热处理、焊接、金属切削、工具、装配等车间来进行工作。又如一个工厂的动力工作，分为锅炉、照明、发电、输电、热力、变电、检查维护等组来进行工作。一个普通机械系的毕业生参加机械工厂的工作，一个机械系（或电机系）动力组的毕业生搞动力工作，不管他们搞其中那一部门工作，一开始都是难以胜任愉快的。他们的工作，是属于“学什么，干什么”的，是符合学用一致的原则的，但他们还会感觉到学用之间存在着距离，他们可能认为这是学用不一致，这种认识是不正确的。他们应该宝贵在高等学校学习的基础，并在实际的工作中加强学习，这才是唯一正确的办法。
    对于学用一致的问题，也还有另一种片面的认识。例如一个机械系毕业生（举其他任何科系毕业生为例也是一样），可做的工作是多方面的，生产部门、计划部门、教育部门、业务行政部门以及基本建设的设计、施工等等方面，都是可以的；单就生产部门说，也还要分生产技术、计划工作、技术保安、技术教育、生产管理等工作。但有的认为要下厂工作，或到工厂里去搞生产技术的工作，才算符合学用一致的原则。这也是对于学用一致的原则的片面理解，这说明他们没有从国家建设的整体来认识学用一致的原则。这里，可能不仅只是一个对于学用一致的认识上的片面性的问题，也可能还包含了一些个人打算的问题，反映了有些人还不能正确地处理个人利益和国家利益的关系问题。
    也有人，在基本建设工作上，只愿搞设计工作，或者强调在学校学习时偏重于设计，或者说自己对于设计有兴趣，不愿搞施工工作，这也是错误的。
    以上的说明和举例，使我们认识到，在目前，要求高等学校毕业生的工作完全达到学用一致的标准，是不合实际的，是离开国家建设需要的孤立看法。对于学用一致的原则，只能根据国家需要的具体情况作相对的不同程度的要求，不能机械地、片面地作过高的要求。假如是机械地、片面地来理解学用一致的原则，而且按照这样的理解来办事，其结果必定使我们国家的建设计划受到阻挠，或使我们国家建设中的好些工作被迫停顿下来。这样使国家利益服从个人利益的错误作法显然是谁也不会同意的。
    人民政府在分配高等学校毕业生的工作中贯彻执行学用一致的原则，其实际的作法是：根据国家建设的需要和高等学校毕业生的具体情况，作合理的分配。这样做的结果，保证了绝大多数的毕业生所分配的工作能符合学用一致的原则，使他们能够愉快地接受政府所分配的工作。
    统一分配高等学校毕业生的工作，应该“在适应国家建设需要的基础上贯彻学用一致的原则”，这
    一指示是完全正确的。希望高等学校的毕业同学们和各有关部门，能正确地认识这一指示，并在实际中贯彻执行这一指示！
