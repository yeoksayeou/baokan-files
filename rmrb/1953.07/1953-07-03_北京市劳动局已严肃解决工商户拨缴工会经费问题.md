    Beijing Labor Bureau Seriously Addresses the Issue of Industrial and Commercial Businesses Allocating Union Funds
    A letter from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau: Your newspaper readers Chen Bo and Sun Deming wrote a letter reflecting that some industrial and commercial businesses in Beijing are not complying with government decrees and are not allocating union funds on time, and requested the People's Government to handle this issue (the original letter was published in the "Letters from Readers" column on December 6th of last year). The handling results are now communicated to you: We notified the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions in December 1952 to inform us of the arrears situation so that we could study handling measures. On January 20, 1953, Ma Guangdou, Deputy Director of our bureau, invited the responsible persons of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Fu Huating, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, to study the handling principles for arrears and how to simplify payment procedures in the future. On January 22nd, 23rd, 24th, February 2nd, and 5th, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce held five meetings to discuss and reach an agreement on specific methods for handling arrears and future payment procedures, and submitted it to the Labor Bureau for filing on March 21st after being signed by both parties. During the negotiation process, there was a situation where some industrial and commercial businesses in the Xidan District repeatedly delayed allocating union funds despite repeated urging. This issue was further researched by the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, together with the Xidan District Labor Section, Trade Union, and Federation of Industry and Commerce, to formulate specific handling opinions on a household-by-household basis, and a resolution was reached on June 4th. Because this issue involves industrial and commercial businesses throughout the city and is relatively complex, the processing time was prolonged.

    北京市劳动局已严肃解决工商户拨缴工会经费问题
    北京市人民政府劳动局来信：你报读者陈波、孙德明写信反映北京市有些工商户不遵守政府法令，不按时拨缴工会经费，并请求人民政府处理这个问题（原信刊去年十二月六日“读者来信”栏）。现将处理结果告诉你们：我们曾于一九五二年十二月通知北京市总工会将欠缴情况告知我们，以便研究处理办法。一九五三年一月二十日，我局马光斗副局长邀请市总工会负责人和市工商联主任委员傅华亭研究欠缴的处理原则以及今后如何简化缴纳手续等问题。一月二十二日、二十三日、二十四日、二月二日、五日，市劳动局、市总工会、市工商联开会研究五次，对处理欠缴的具体办法及今后缴纳手续取得协议，并于三月二十一日经双方签字送劳动局备案。在协商过程中，曾发生西单区部分工商户屡经催促，仍拖延不拨缴工会经费的情形。这个问题又由市劳动局、市总工会、市工商联会同西单区劳动科、工会、工商联逐户研究具体处理意见，在六月四日获得解决。因这个问题牵涉全市工商户，比较复杂，因而处理时间拖延较长。
