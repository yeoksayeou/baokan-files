How to Distinguish Between Permanent Residents and Outgoing Population
Central Population Census Registration Office

    Permanent residents are people who regularly live in a place. Everyone, at a certain time, such as the standard time for the population census registration, will have a regular place of residence. In this way, if we register the permanent residents of all parts of the country during the standard time, we can obtain a national population figure that is neither duplicated nor omitted. This method of registering permanent residents is not only simpler and easier to implement than the method of registering current residents, but also conforms to our current actual situation, especially the characteristics of this population census combined with the general election, which takes a long time. As for a person who has residences in several places, he/she should be registered as a permanent resident in a regular residence according to the regulation that a person can only be registered as a permanent resident in one place. Some people who do not have a permanent residence can be registered as permanent residents at their location at the time of the census registration. Some people think that being registered as a permanent resident in one place means that they have to live there permanently and cannot move around at will in the future. This is a completely unnecessary misunderstanding. Because investigating permanent residents is only a method of investigating the population to avoid duplication and omission, and does not involve determining the permanent residence of each person.

    However, permanent residents cannot always stay there without moving. Many people are constantly moving. This raises the question of whether an outgoing population from a household should still be counted as a permanent resident of the household. This should first be determined from the nature of the person's departure, and only when the outgoing situation is unclear should it be determined by time. Although some people have gone out, they will return at any time and have not settled down outside. All such outgoing populations, such as those going out on official business, traveling, visiting relatives and friends, running businesses, doing odd jobs, and engaging in transportation work, etc., are temporary, and are temporary outgoing populations. Therefore, regardless of the length of their time away from home, they should be registered as permanent residents of the household and not registered elsewhere. Some outgoing populations are engaged in work or study in institutions, troops, organizations, schools, factories, mines, workshops, companies, shops, hospitals, farms, cooperatives, and construction sites. These populations have regular residences outside, so they should all be registered as permanent residents in their regular place of residence, that is, the place of accommodation where they work or study, and registered as outgoing populations at home.

    However, for some outgoing populations, it is not clear whether they have settled down outside, or even their whereabouts and life and death are unknown. For this type of population, it is necessary to follow the provisions of Article 8, Paragraph 3 of the National Population Census Registration Method: those who have been away from home for no more than six months should still be registered as permanent residents; those who have been away for more than six months should be registered as outgoing population.

    In the population census, some places have also encountered difficulties because the permanent residence of some people is not easy to determine, and they feel that registration in any place is possible. For this situation, as long as the principle of not omitting or duplicating is grasped, permanent residents can be registered at one location based on the living situation and the individual's opinion.

    Whether permanent residents and outgoing population can be correctly distinguished is a key issue related to whether this population census registration can be accurate. Therefore, in addition to the cadres handling the population census registration paying special attention to the investigation during registration, they should also publicize and explain the criteria and methods for distinguishing between permanent residents and outgoing population to the broad masses of people to obtain the people's assistance and support. Only in this way can we ensure that the population surveyed this time can obtain a comprehensive and accurate figure.

    怎样判别常住人口和外出人口
    中央人口调查登记办公室
    常住人口就是经常居住在一个地方的人口，每个人在一定时间，比如说在人口调查登记的标准时间，都会有一个经常居住的地点。这样我们把标准时间内全国各地的常住人口登记起来，则可求得一个既不会重复也不会遗漏的全国人口数字。这种登记常住人口的办法，不仅比登记现住人口的办法简单易行，而且符合我们当前的实际情况，特别是符合这次人口调查结合普选进行，时间拉得很长的特点。至于一个人在几个地方都有住所的，则应根据一个人只能在一个地方登记为常住人口的规定，确定在一个常住所登记为常住人口。有些没有常住所的人口，则可在调查登记时所在地登记为常住人口。有些人以为在一地登记为常住人口，就得永久住下去，以后再不能随便迁移了。这完全是一种不必要的误解。因为调查常住人口，只是为了避免重复遗漏的一种调查人口的方法，并不牵涉到确定每个人的永久住所等问题。
    可是常住人口并不能经常住在那里不动，好多人是在经常流动着的。这样就发生一户外出人口还算不算本户常住人口的问题。这首先要从这个人外出的性质上来判别，外出情况不明时，才依时间来判别。有些人虽然外出了，但随时要回来，在外并未定居。凡属这类的外出人口如外出公干、旅行、探亲、访友、跑生意、打短工、以及从事交通运输工作等等，均带有临时性，是临时外出人口，所以不论其 外出时间长短，都应登记为本户的常住人口，在外不予登记。有些外出人口系外出参加机关、部队、团体、学校、工厂、矿山、作坊、公司、商店、医院、农场、合作社及建筑工地等工作或学习，这种人口在外已有经常住所，所以都应在其经常居住地，即参加工作或学习的住宿地登记为常住人口，在家登记为在外人口。
    但是有些外出人口在外定居与否弄不清楚，甚至有行踪生死不明的，对这种人口就需要依照全国人口调查登记办法第八条第三款的规定：凡离家未超过六个月者，仍登记为常住人口；已超过六个月者，登记为在外人口。
    各地在调查人口中，也曾遇到有些人的常住所不好确定，觉得登记在那里都可以，因而发生困难。对于这种情况，只要掌握不遗漏不重复的原则，根据居住情况和本人的意见，可以在一个地点登记为常住人口。
    常住人口与在外人口能否正确的判别，是有关这次人口调查登记能否准确的一个关键问题。因此，除办理人口调查登记的干部在登记时应特别细心考察外，并应向广大群众宣传解释判别常住人口与在外人口的标准和办法，以取得人民的协助和支持。只有这样才可以保证这次调查的人口能得到一个全面确实的数字。
