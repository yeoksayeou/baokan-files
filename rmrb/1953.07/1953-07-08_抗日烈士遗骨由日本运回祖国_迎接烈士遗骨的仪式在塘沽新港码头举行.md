Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 7th: Five hundred and sixty remains of anti-Japanese martyrs who sacrificed in Japan have been returned to the motherland on the Japanese ship "Kuroshio Maru" on the 7th. A grand ceremony to welcome the remains of the martyrs was held at Tanggu Xingang Wharf.

    Among those who went to the wharf to welcome the remains of the martyrs were Liao Chengzhi, as well as heads and representatives from the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Tianjin Troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, the Tianjin Democratic Women's Federation, the Tianjin Democratic Youth Federation, the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Tianjin Branch of the China People's Relief Administration, as well as more than 400 workers, students, and citizens from the Tanggu District. Also present to welcome them were family members of anti-Japanese martyrs, representatives of survivors who were captured by the Japanese during the Anti-Japanese War, and representatives of overseas Chinese who recently returned from Japan. Wearing black纱 armbands, they stood on the wharf with heavy hearts, welcoming the remains of the martyrs.

    At 10:55 AM, the military band played mournful music. At this time, the people welcoming on the shore and the Japanese sailors on the ship all stood in solemn silence. The "Chinese Victims' Remains Escort Group," led by Nakayama Osamu, walked silently off the ship holding the martyrs' memorial tablets and urns, and were greeted by Liao Chengzhi, heads of various people's organizations in Tianjin, and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The people welcoming the ashes solemnly and respectfully placed the martyrs' remains on the hearse with both hands. Then, the welcomers placed wreaths and elegiac couplets dedicated to the martyrs by overseas Chinese in Japan and peace-loving people in Japan on the hearse. Wreaths and elegiac couplets were presented by overseas Chinese organizations such as the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, the Chinese Youth Association, and the Overseas Chinese Cultural and Economic Association, as well as overseas Chinese in Japan. Wreaths and elegiac couplets were also presented by the Japanese Communist Party, the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the All-Japan Seamen's Union, the Japanese National Relief Association, the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, the Japan Buddhist Federation, the World Buddhist Japanese League, and many other groups and individuals.

    After the martyrs' remains were moved into the hearse, people observed three minutes of silence for the martyrs. At this time, all the people who came to greet them bowed their heads in mourning. The Japanese sailors standing on the ship also stood in silence.

    Liao Chengzhi delivered a speech in a sorrowful tone. (Full text to be issued separately)

    Nakayama Osamu, the head of the "Chinese Victims' Remains Escort Group," then delivered a speech. He said: When these ashes arrive, I will express my heartfelt apologies to the people of your country. In the past, if the will of we peace-loving Japanese people had been stronger and the strength greater, we would certainly have been able to protect the lives of these martyrs. However, I am ashamed to say that the opposite was true. We prostrate ourselves before the people of your country and the families of the martyrs to express our apology. At the same time, this is also a sincere apology from all the Japanese people. He said: The deeper our sense of shame, the stronger our oath for peace and friendship in the face of the remains of the martyred and the people of your country. There is no reason for the people of Japan and China to fight again. The people of Japan, China, and Korea should always be united like brothers and sisters, in an honest and friendly spirit. This is our belief and the heartfelt desire of the Japanese people. Nakayama Osamu said: We are the escort group for the martyrs' remains, and at the same time, we have come to your country as envoys of peace and friendship. Even if our stay in your country is very short, I am willing to do my best to complete this task. Nakayama Osamu said: The past history of your people fighting to defend independence, peace, and friendship is a great lesson for us now, and it also illuminates our future. We want to talk and interact with the people of your country with a humble heart, and join hands to contribute all our strength to the friendship between Japan, China, and Korea, and to the peace of Asia.

    After the ceremony to welcome the martyrs' remains ended, the hearse drove to Tianjin East Railway Station, and the ashes were transported to the memorial hall of the First Cemetery by cars wearing black纱. The people who came to welcome the ashes paid their respects to the martyrs again before leaving the memorial hall.

    This group of anti-Japanese martyrs were Chinese anti-Japanese soldiers captured during the Anti-Japanese War and Chinese laborers who were forcibly conscripted, including a small number of Eighth Route Army soldiers and workers, most of whom were from the old liberated areas of North China. After being taken to Japan, they were murdered by Japanese militarists. The remains returned this time are only a very small part of the remains scattered throughout Japan, mainly the martyrs who died in the Hanaoka Massacre. Between July 1944 and June 1945, the Japanese government used the puppet "North China Labor Association" to transport more than 900 captured Chinese anti-Japanese soldiers and forcibly conscripted Chinese workers from China to the Hanaoka Mine in Akita Prefecture, Japan, in three batches. Many of them had already died from abuse during transportation. After arriving at the Hanaoka Mine, they were often in a state of semi-starvation and forced to do extremely cruel heavy labor. As a result, many people died every month. On June 30, 1945, the captured Chinese soldiers and workers, unable to endure any longer, killed four Japanese who had abused them and a traitor, and collectively fled to the nearby mountains and forests, but were later captured by Japanese military police. The Japanese military police did not give the captured persons food for four consecutive days, gave each person only a bowl of water each day in the scorching summer, and constantly beat them. According to current investigations, a total of 561 Chinese workers and soldiers were killed under such brutal abuse. The total number of urns brought back this time is 431, some of which contain ashes collectively cremated after several or more than a dozen people died, totaling 560 remains.

    After Japan surrendered, the Yokohama Military Tribunal of the General Headquarters of the U.S. Occupation Forces in Japan delayed until March 1, 1948, before sentencing a few minor offenders related to the Hanaoka Massacre, while none of the main offenders were sentenced. They are still at large in various parts of Japan. The U.S. occupation authorities, the Japanese government, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit delegation in Japan colluded with each other to cover up the truth of the massacre. It was not until 1950, under the thorough investigation and pursuit of the Democratic Promotion Association of Overseas Chinese in Japan, that the truth was revealed to the world. With the help of peace-loving people in Japan and the support of the people of the motherland, the overseas Chinese in Japan were finally able to break through various obstacles set by the Yoshida government and transport this batch of martyrs' remains back to the motherland.

    抗日烈士遗骨由日本运回祖国
    迎接烈士遗骨的仪式在塘沽新港码头举行
    【新华社天津七日电】我国牺牲在日本的抗日烈士的遗骨五百六十具，已于七日由日轮“黑潮丸”运回祖国。迎接烈士遗骨的仪式在塘沽新港码头隆重举行。
    前往码头迎接烈士遗骨的有廖承志以及中国红十字会天津市分会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会天津市分会、中国人民解放军驻天津部队、天津市总工会、天津市民主妇女联合会、天津市民主青年联合会、天津市文学艺术界联合会、天津市工商业联合会、中国人民救济总会天津市分会等单位负责人和代表，和塘沽区工人、学生、市民等共四百多人。前往迎接的还有抗日烈士家属、抗日战争中被日本俘掳生还者的代表和最近由日本回国的华侨代表多人。他们臂带黑纱，以沉痛的心情，伫立在码头上，迎接烈士们的遗骨。
    十时五十五分，军乐队奏起了哀乐。这时，在岸上迎接的人们和轮船上的日本海员全体肃立。以中山理理为首的“中国人殉难者遗骨护送团”捧着烈士的灵位和骨灰匣，从船上默默地走下来，由廖承志和天津市各人民团体的负责人、中国人民解放军战士们迎接。迎接骨灰的人们庄严而肃穆地双手捧着烈士的遗骨安放到灵车上。接着，迎接的人们把我国旅日侨胞和日本爱好和平的人民献给烈士们的花圈、挽幛，安放到灵车上。献花圈和挽幛的有东京华侨总会、中华青年会、华侨文化经济协会等华侨团体和我国旅日侨胞。献花圈和挽幛的还有日本共产党、全日本产业别工会会议、全日本海员工会、日本国民救援会、日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络委员会、日本佛教联合会、世界佛教徒日本联盟及其他许多团体和个人。
    烈士遗骨移入灵车后，人们为烈士们默哀三分钟。这时，全体迎接的人们都俯首致哀。站在船上的日本海员们也肃立默哀。
    廖承志以沉痛的语调致词。（全文另发）
    “中国人殉难者遗骨护送团”团长中山理理接着致词。他说：当这些骨灰来时，我将要在贵国人民面前表示衷心的歉意。在过去，假如我们爱好和平的日本人民的意志能够更强烈，力量能够更大的话，我们一定能够保卫这些烈士的生命。但是，惭愧得很，事实刚好相反。我们仰天伏地对贵国人民和在诸烈士遗族面前表示谢罪。同时，这也是全日本人民的衷心谢罪。他说：我们惭愧之心愈深，在殉难烈士的遗骨和贵国人民面前为了和平与友好而宣誓的心也更加强烈。日本与中国两国人民之间没有任何理由再来作战。日本、中国、朝鲜的人民应该永远像兄弟一样，以诚实的、友好的精神紧紧地团结在一起。这是我们的信念，也是日本人民衷心的热望。中山理理说：我们是烈士遗骨的护送团，同时也是以和平和友好的使节到贵国来的。在贵国逗留的时间即使很短，我愿意尽全力来完成这个任务。中山理理说：为保卫独立、和平与友好而战斗的贵国人民的过去的历史，对于现在的我们来说，是一个伟大的教训，同时也照耀着我们的未来。我们要以谦虚的心情，同贵国人民交谈、接触，手拉着手，为了日本、中国、朝鲜友好，为了亚洲的和平贡献我们所有的力量。
    迎接烈士遗骨仪式结束后，灵车即开往天津东站，由扎着黑纱的汽车将骨灰运往第一公墓灵堂。迎接骨灰的人们离开灵堂前又再次向烈士致敬。
    这一批抗日烈士，是在抗日战争中被俘的中国抗日士兵和被强征的中国劳动人民，包括少数八路军士兵和工人，其中大部分是华北老解放区的，他们被押到日本后被日本军国主义者杀害。这次运回的遗骨，仅是散在日本各地的遗骨的极小的一部分，主要是花冈惨案中的被难烈士。在一九四四年七月到一九四五年六月间，日本政府曾利用伪“华北劳工协会”先后分三批把被俘的中国抗日士兵和被强征的中国工人共九百多人，从中国押送到日本秋田县花冈矿山做苦工。在被押送的途中，他们已有许多人被虐待死亡，到了花冈矿山之后，他们又经常处在半饥饿的状态下，被迫作极残酷的重力劳动。因此，每月都有好多人死亡。一九四五年六月三十日，被俘的中国士兵和工人忍无可忍，把四个虐待他们的日本人和一个汉奸杀死，并集体逃到附近的山林里，后来又被日本军警捕回。日本军警对被捕者连续四天不给食物，在酷热的夏天每人每天只给一碗水，并不断地殴打他们。据现在查明的，在这样残暴的虐待下，被杀害的中国工人和士兵共有五百六十一人。这次携回的骨灰匣总数是四百三十一个，有些是几个人或十几个人牺牲后集体烧成骨灰，装一个瓶子里的，一共遗骨五百六十具。
    日本投降后，美国驻日占领军总部的横滨军事法庭拖延到一九四八年三月一日才判处了花冈惨案的有关的少数次要人犯，而最主要人犯一个也未判刑。迄今仍在日本各地逍遥法外。美国占领当局、日本政府和蒋匪驻日代表团并互相勾结，掩盖惨案真相。直到一九五○年，在旅日华侨民主促进会的彻底调查和追究下，真相始大白于天下。旅日华侨在日本爱好和平的人民协助下和祖国人民的支援下，卒能打破吉田政府种种阻挠，将这批烈士遗骨运回祖国。
