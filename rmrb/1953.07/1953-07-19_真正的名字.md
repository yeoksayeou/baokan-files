    True Name
    Bai Xuejian
    It was Sunday noon, and I was walking towards the public stadium. A young, tall soldier with a proud chest and arms swinging high, strode towards me, "ka", "ka", "ka". I thought to myself: Hey! Now that's what a national defense soldier looks like!
    As he got closer, I saw, ah, it turned out to be Comrade Wang Baotian. I knew him well: he was a famous assault hero in the Tianjin battle; I had also met him at the celebration conference for the victory over the bandits held in Nanning in 1951. I quickly greeted him, he snapped to attention, gave a salute, and we shook hands tightly.
    I asked: "Comrade Baotian! What brings you to the division headquarters?"
    His big, bright eyes flashed for a moment, and he said: "I'm here to learn wireless telephony!"
    "So, you are a primary school graduate!" I knew that to come to the wireless telephony training class, one had to have a primary school education.
    He laughed heartily. I remembered when I interviewed him at the 1951 celebration conference and asked him to sign his name, he frankly said: "I'm a roughneck, I can't write, you sign for me!" But today, in just over a year, his educational level has reached primary school graduation, and he is about to master wireless telephony! I also laughed heartily: "Comrade Baotian! You have made rapid progress!"
    He squeezed my hand even tighter and said: "Comrade Bai! My name is not Baotian anymore! Really! I changed my name!"
    "Changed your name! What is it?" I looked at him in confusion.
    "Defend the Nation!" He puffed out his chest and said proudly.
    "Ah! Defend the Nation! That's a good name! Very resonant and meaningful."
    "Yes! Otherwise, I wouldn't have changed it!"
    I saw his eagerness and guessed that there must be a story behind it. I found a quiet place, and we talked.
    "Baotian is not my real name."
    "Not your real name?"
    "It was temporary."
    "Names can be temporary?" I laughed.
    "Not just one, several, all temporary."
    Before I could ask further, he continued:
    "Let me start from the beginning! In the old society, my family couldn't make ends meet every day, and it was even harder for poor people to have children! As soon as I was born, my mother couldn't even get a bowl of noodle soup, so how could she be in the mood to give the child a name! Seeing that I was a 'boy', I was called 'Big Boy', and that's what I was called until I was eight years old. One day, my dad looked at me and said with a smile: Hey! Look at our Big Boy, he looks like a little tiger with his tiger head and leopard eyes. My mom said, the child is eight years old! It's time to give him a name! Dad said let's call him 'Little Tiger'!"
    "Ah, that's a powerful name!" I interjected.
    "You bet! It even 'ate' someone!" He made me laugh again.
    "Don't laugh! It's true, after being called 'Little Tiger' for four years, when I was twelve years old, my dad sent me to the landlord Zhang Dabuzi's house to herd pigs. Zhang Dabuzi had a treasured son named 'Fat Baby'. Not two days after I arrived at his house, Fat Baby died of a sudden illness! Zhang Dabuzi's wife cried and asked the Bodhisattva at the temple, and came back and beat me up."
    "Why did he beat you?"
    "Why! People said: This Little Tiger ate Fat Baby! A beating wasn't enough, Zhang Dabuzi glared with his ox gallbladder eyes and said: You are not allowed to be called 'Little Tiger' anymore, you must change your name to 'Fool!' I'm full of cleverness, how could I be 'foolish', we are not fools, we are poor! When people are poor, they are not even allowed to have a nice name!
    "In 1947, my family was liberated, and the landlord was overthrown! The family was given houses and land. At the enlistment meeting, I, Wang Fool, signed up to join the army with the determination to defend the fields and protect our home, and everyone applauded. A fellow villager said: Fool is not a good name, it's a name that the landlord used to insult us poor people, it should be changed. Everyone discussed it and said: 'To defend the fields and protect our home, let's go to the front line, let's call him Baotian!' So I was called Baotian. At that time, I felt that this name was very glorious. Yes, I joined the army to defend the fruits of our liberation! I often thought of the large field I had been allocated, with its lush green wheat seedlings, and I always thought: We must never let the landlord 'turn the tables'. Therefore, whenever someone called me 'Baotian', I was very happy! When fighting, I was particularly brave. In the Liberation War, I made three great contributions.
    "After the founding of the New China, we became a regular national defense army! The troops no longer shouted slogans of defending the fields and protecting our home, but changed to defending world peace and defending our great and lovable motherland! The superiors often talked about the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, saying a lot, it sounded very fresh and comfortable at first, but after a while, it was all forgotten! What I remembered most was the two mu of land and the old ox that my family had been given, because my mom mentioned them every time she wrote! So, there was only 'home' in my head, and I was less enthusiastic about my work! Some people criticized me for being a peasant with a peasant mentality, and I was not convinced and said: I came from a peasant background!
    "Home—became a knot in my heart. Since studying culture, hey! My eyes lit up in an instant! The peasant mentality knot was also opened with a whoosh! It's true that the motherland is great and lovely! First of all, let's talk about the area of our motherland! Nearly ten million square kilometers, about the size of Europe, equal to forty Britains, two hundred and thirty Switzerlands, the United States is even smaller than our China by more than one million seven hundred thousand square kilometers! In terms of population! It is the world's first! The world has a total population of more than twenty billion, and China alone has five billion! That's almost two billion more than the entire population of the Americas, including the United States!"
    I was amazed at his memory.
    As he spoke, he hurriedly opened his bag and took out a book. I took it
    looked, it turned out to be one of the "Lovely Motherland" in the Warrior Newspaper Series, on which was written: Comrade Weiguo's reading, a gift from all comrades of the Second Company.
    I said, "This is a great gift."
    "Yes! This time I came to study, the old comrades in the company, gave me towels and soap, I said: Don't do the same old thing! If you want to give, give me a book! This morning, the instructor, on behalf of the whole company, gave me this book! He also said: Read it several times, see how great and lovely our motherland is!"
    He flipped through the book, just talking. The inventions of our ancestors: gunpowder, papermaking, printing, the compass, the products of our motherland: rice, wheat, tung oil, tea, silk; gold, silver, copper, iron, and antimony, tungsten; the Great Wall, the Grand Canal, the Yangtze River... The more he said, the more energetic he became, never stopping.
    "Hey, it's a really good comparison," he said: "Our motherland is like a plump, beautiful rooster, the Northeast is the head, Xinjiang is the tail, and Beijing is the rooster's throat! When the rooster crows, the sky dawns! The sun comes out! Everyone starts working!"
    At this time, he closed the book and said: "From this year on, the motherland will begin its great construction! Mines will be installed in barren mountains and wild forests! The big yellow cattle will become tractors in the future! The more our motherland moves forward, the greater and more lovable it will become!"
    His optimistic and proud feelings infected me, as if a heat was transmitted to me.
    He tidied up his clothes and said: "It's strange! Once you see far, your thoughts are different from before. When someone calls me Wang Baotian again, it's like revealing my shortcomings, I always feel uncomfortable. Coincidentally, my mom wrote to me again and said: Baotian, come back and see us when you have time! See how green our wheat seedlings are, how fat the yellow cattle are! Mom keeps saying Baotian, but mom doesn't know what I'm thinking? It's not just about protecting the fields, if the country is not protected, and peace is not protected, how can we protect the fields! Isn't the Korean War obvious! If American imperialism comes to attack, where will there be a home, where will there be fields?
    Lying in bed at night, thinking about the name Baotian, the more I thought about it, the more wrong it felt. Yes, I came from a peasant background, but now I am standing on the position of the working class, and I should have separated from the peasant mentality long ago! I went to the instructor, talked about my thoughts, and asked to change my name. I gave myself a name called 'Defend the Nation'. The instructor said that my idea was good, but changing the name had to be approved by the higher authorities. I said that I had never had a real name since I was a child, sometimes called Big Boy, sometimes called Little Tiger, the landlord even called me Fool, and the villagers called me Baotian. I felt that these were all temporary names, and only 'Defend the Nation' was my real name. The instructor said, you write a report. So I wrote a detailed report. Not many days later, the regimental party committee approved it!
    "Roll call by the instructor was interesting!
    'Wang Weiguo!'
    'Here!' I answered very loudly. Everyone stared at me and laughed. I felt like I had eaten a piece of candy, sweet from my mouth to my heart.
    I wrote a letter to my mom, explaining the reasons, and asked my younger brother to read the newspaper to my mom more often. Not many days later, my mom's reply came. He said: Weiguo, you changed your name well, the reasons are correct! Without the country, where is the home?"
    From his laughter, I heard his heart, which loved the motherland, beating.
    When we parted, I looked at his tall back, his vigorous steps, as if he was running quickly towards a happy tomorrow. His back was walking further and further away from me, but his image became bigger and bigger in my eyes, and I stood there for a long time, not moving at all. (Attached picture)
    Speaking, he hurriedly opened his bag and took out a book...

    真正的名字
    白雪剑
    那是星期日的中午，我向公共体育场走去。一个年轻的大高个的战士，胸脯挺挺的，两臂甩得高高的，迈着步伐，“卡”，“卡”，“卡”地走了过来。我心里说：嘿！这才像个国防军样儿哩！
    等他走近了，我一瞧，啊，原来是王保田同志。他，我可熟识：天津战斗中，他是有名的突击英雄；一九五一年在南宁召开的庆祝剿匪胜利庆功大会上，我又遇见过他。我急忙招呼他，他拍地立正，敬了个礼，我俩紧紧握起手来。
    我问：“保田同志！来师部有啥事？”
    他那大而发亮的眼睛闪动了一下，说：“学无线电话来啦！”
    “这么说，你是高小毕业生啦！”我知道，到无线电话训练班来的，要有高小毕业的文化程度。
    他乐得直笑。我想起一九五一年庆功大会时，我访问他，请他签名，他坦白地说：“咱是大老粗，不会写，你替我签吧！”而到今天，不过短短一年多的光景，他的文化水平已经达到高小毕业程度，马上就要掌握无线电话啦！我也乐得直笑：“保田同志！你进步的很快呀！”
    他把我的手握的更紧了，说道：“白同志！我不叫保田啦！真的！我改了名啦！”
    “改名啦！叫什么？”我疑惑地望着他。
    “卫国”！他把胸脯挺了一下，自豪地说。
    “啊！卫国！这名字好呀！挺响亮，又有意义。”
    “是呀！要不我那能改呢！”
    我瞧他那劲儿，猜想这里边一定有文章。找了个清静的地方，我和他谈了起来。
    “保田不是我的真名字。”
    “不是真名字？”
    “那是临时的。”
    “名字还有临时的？”我笑了。
    “不光一个，好几个呢，都是临时的。”
    他不等我再问，就接下去了：
    “我就从头说起吧！在旧社会里，我家整日揭不开锅盖，穷人再要添小孩，那更难啦！我一落地，妈连碗疙瘩汤都喝不到嘴里，哪有心给孩子起名呢！看我是个‘小子’，就叫‘大小子’，一直叫到八岁。有一天，爹瞧着我，笑着说：嘿！看俺大小子，长的虎头豹眼的，真像只小老虎。我妈就说，孩子八岁啦！也该起个名啦！爹说就叫‘小老虎’吧！”
    “啊，这名字可厉害！”我插了一句。
    “可不！还‘吃’了个人呢？”他又把我逗笑了。
    “别笑！是真事，‘小老虎’叫了四年，我十二岁时，爹送我到地主张大肚子家去放猪。张大肚子有个宝贝儿子，叫‘胖娃娃’。我到他家不两天，胖娃娃得了个急病就死啦！张大肚子的老婆哭着鼻子，到庙里问了问菩萨，回来揍了我一顿。”
    “他为啥揍你呢？”
    “为啥！人家说：我这小老虎把胖娃娃吃啦！打了一顿还不算，张大肚子瞪着牛胆子眼说：以后不许你叫‘小老虎’，要改名叫‘傻子！’我满肚子心眼，哪里‘傻’，咱不是傻，是穷！人穷了连个好听的名字也不许有啊！
    “一九四七年我家里解放了，地主斗垮啦！家里分了房子分了地。在参军大会上，我说王傻子报名参军决心保田保家，大伙鼓掌。有个乡亲说：傻子这名字不好，这是地主糟践咱穷人的名字，要改改。大伙一合计，说：‘为了保田保家上前线，就叫保田吧’！我就叫保田啦。当时我觉得这个名字挺光荣。是呀，我就是为了保卫翻身果实才当兵的呀！我想起分得那一大片田里，长着绿油油的麦苗，常想：决不能再叫地主‘翻把’。因此谁要一叫我‘保田’，我心里可高兴哩！打起仗来，也特别勇敢。在解放战争中，我立了三大功。
    “新中国成立以后，咱们变成正规的国防军啦！部队再不喊保田保家的口号，换成保卫世界和平，保卫伟大可爱的祖国啦！上级常讲祖国的伟大和可爱，一说一大片，乍听时很新鲜，很舒服，过一会就忘光啦！记得最深刻的还是家里分到的那二亩地和那头老黄牛，因为妈一来信就提它呀！这样脑袋里只有个‘家’啦，干工作，积极劲也就小啦！有人批评说我是农民意识作怪，我还不服气地说：咱是农民出身嘛！
    “家——在我心里成了个疙瘩。自从学习了文化，嘿！我这眼刷地一下亮啦！农民意识的疙瘩也就给哗一下打开啦！说祖国伟大可爱，那可真不假呀！先说咱祖国的面积吧！将近一千万平方公里，跟一个欧洲差不多大，等于四十个英国，二百三十多个瑞士，美国比咱中国还小一百七十多万平方公里呢！论人口吧！更是世界第一！全世界总共二十多万万人口，光咱中国就有五万万！比包括美国在内的整个美洲的人口还多差不多两万万哩！”
    对于他的记忆，我感到惊异。
    说着，他急忙打开挂包，掏出一本书来。我接过来
    一看，原来是战士报丛书之一的“可爱的祖国”，上面写：卫国同志存阅，二连全体同志赠。
    我说：“这真是好礼物”。
    “是呀！我这次来学习，连里老战友们，又送毛巾，又送肥皂，我说：别来这老一套啦！要送，就送本书吧！今天早晨指导员代表全连把这本书送给我啦！还说：要多多看它几遍，看我们祖国是多么伟大，可爱！”
    他翻着书，只顾说。咱们祖先的发明：火药、造纸、印刷术、指南针，咱们祖国的出产：大米小麦、桐油呀，茶、丝呀；金银铜铁，还有锑、钨呀；万里长城呀，运河呀，长江呀……越说越带劲，没个完。
    “嗨，比得真对，”他说：“咱祖国像只丰满美丽的大公鸡，东北是头，新疆是尾，北京正是公鸡的咽喉！公鸡一啼，天就亮啦！太阳就出来啦！大家就开始干活啦！”
    这时，他把书合起来，说：“从今年起，祖国开始大建设啦！荒山野林都要安上矿厂啦！大黄牛往后都要变成拖拉机啦！咱祖国越往前走，就越伟大，越可爱！”
    他那种乐观、自豪的感情，感染了我，好像有一股热力传到我身上似的。
    他整顿了一下衣帽，接着说：“也怪！一看得远，想法就跟以前不同了。谁再叫我王保田，好像揭我短处似的，总觉着不舒服。偏巧，妈又来信说：保田儿呀，有空回来看看吧！看咱麦苗长的多绿，黄牛多胖呀！妈张口保田，闭口保田，可是妈那知我的心思呢？不能光是保田呀，国不保，和平不保，哪还保得了田呀！朝鲜战争不是明摆着的吗！美帝国主义要打来了，哪还有家，哪还有田呢？
    晚上睡在被窝里，想保田这名字，越想越不对头。是的，我是农民出身，但我现在是站在工人阶级立场上，早就该跟农民意识分家了呀！我去找指导员，把我这思想谈了谈，并要求改名。我给我自己起了个名字叫‘卫国’。指导员说，我这思想很好，可是改名必须经上级批准。我说，我从小就没有真正的名字，一会儿叫大小子，一会儿叫小老虎，地主还叫我傻子，乡亲们叫我保田。我觉得这都是临时的名字，只有这‘卫国’才是我真正的名字。指导员说，你写报告吧。我就写了个详细的报告。不几天，团党委批准啦！
    “指导员点名，才有意思哩！
    ‘王卫国！’
    ‘有！’我答得真响。大伙盯着我直笑。我真像吃了块糖似的，从嘴里甜到心里。
    我给我妈写了一封信，讲了一遍道理，还叫弟弟多给妈读报。不几天，妈的回信来啦。他说：卫国儿呀！你名字改得好，道理说得对！没有国，那有家呢？”
    我从他的笑声中，听见了他那颗热爱祖国的心在跳动着。
    当我俩分手时，我瞅着他那高大的背影，矫健的步伐，好像要很快地奔向幸福的明天一样。背影愈走离我愈远，可是他的形象在我眼里却越来变得越大，我久久地在那里站着，一动也没动。（附图片）
    说着，他急忙打开挂包，掏出一本书来……
