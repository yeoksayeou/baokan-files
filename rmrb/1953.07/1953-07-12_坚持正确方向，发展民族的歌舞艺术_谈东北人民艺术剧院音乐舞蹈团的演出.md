    Adhere to the Correct Direction and Develop National Song and Dance Art
    —On the Performance of the Northeast People's Art Theater Music and Dance Troupe
    Ye Lin
    The song and dance art of all ethnic groups in China has a long history and an excellent tradition, and is an important part of the spiritual wealth of all ethnic groups. Countless outstanding folk artists are the inheritors and creators of infinitely rich folk song and dance art. The establishment of new national song and dance must be linked to the national and folk song and dance art traditions. First, we must learn and sort out these heritages, and then seek further development on this basis. This is a complex and arduous task. At present, after reorganization, cultural and artistic groups in various places have established a number of song and dance troupes whose task is to develop national and folk song and dance. This work has just begun. Due to limitations in ideological and artistic levels, although the direction is clear, the road is difficult. In this process, any successful or failed experiences are worthy of our attention. From this point of view, the artistic practice of the Northeast People's Art Theater Music and Dance Troupe in recent years and its performance in Beijing this time are particularly worthy of our excitement and attention.
    The Northeast People's Art Theater Music and Dance Troupe is a cultural and artistic combat team with a long history. Its predecessor was the Northeast Music Work Troupe and the Lu Xun Academy of Arts Literary Work Troupe, later the Lu Xun Academy of Arts Music Work Troupe. It has been nearly two years since the establishment of the troupe in October 1951 after the establishment of the Northeast People's Art Theater. In recent years, due to the troupe's excellent tradition of fighting in the past literary and art troupes and the early professional division of labor, coupled with the persistent efforts of the comrades of the Music and Dance Troupe to study folk art in recent years, new programs have continued to emerge, and their work has been fruitful. From the 28 programs brought to Beijing for performance this time, we can see that most of the programs have a good intention to develop folk song and dance art, indicating that their spirit of research in inheriting tradition is diligent, and they have accumulated experience for further practice.
    Looking at the six programs in the dance section, except for the Fan Dance and Plate Dance, which were learned from brotherly cultural and artistic work troupes, the remaining four programs were all collectively choreographed under the guidance of outstanding folk artists, and each dance has been developed. In particular, the Single Drum Dance arranged under the guidance of folk artist Fan Jingtian and the Flower Drum arranged under the guidance of folk artist Xu Yanlai both show a particularly distinct folk style and strength, retaining a unique rhythm of folk dance that is extremely precious, making people feel intimate. As for the Northeast Yangko arranged under the guidance of folk artist Liu Shengcheng, it preserves a folk dance that is about to be lost, and gives it new content. This approach is also very good.
    Among the four programs in the instrumental music section, there is also a clear intention to explore and develop national musical instruments and even improve their performance forms. They use guzheng and erhu to play together; and they have transformed the huqin, processing it into a huqin quartet according to its size and timbre. In the attempt to combine Chinese and Western musical instruments, they boldly use a symphony orchestra to accompany the suona, and let folk artist Wang Wenzhou serve as the suona soloist.
    In the practice of developing and improving folk art forms, the most satisfactory are the Shandong Qinshu "Da Gang and Xiao Lan" and "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai Going Down the Mountain". The troupe's singing group was established as early as when Comrade Lü Ji led the Northeast Music Work Troupe, and received great attention. In recent years, due to the efforts of these actors, they have continuously strived to improve in terms of content, music, and singing performance methods, and the results are remarkable. At present, this program has reached a fairly complete level in terms of singing form. They use rich singing skills to express the characters' personalities and emotional changes, and the combination of expression and singing is also very natural; in addition, they have achieved coordinated and consistent effects in the processing of accompaniment, becoming a new national singing form that has been improved.
    In addition, in terms of chorus, "The Sun Comes Out Red All Over the Sky" is created by absorbing the melody characteristics of Errenzhuan. Although the choir has some limitations in terms of number and volume, it has strengths in expressing emotions, full of life and enthusiasm; the folk song chorus "Flying Kites" is an excellent attempt at a folk song singing method.
    These programs very prominently demonstrate their spirit of learning from the folk and their tireless attempts to develop new national song and dance on the basis of folk art. The scope of these practices is so wide, indicating that the troupe's vitality is strong. In this process, one of the greatest characteristics of their work is the close cooperation with folk artists. They invite old artists to be teachers and absorb young artists to participate in the work of the troupe, which has played a great role. Artists not only guide rehearsals and impart skills, but also often perform on the same stage. The program is very popular when performed, which greatly encourages their confidence in learning from the folk. All this shows that the efforts and work direction of the Music and Dance Troupe are correct and worthy of learning by song and dance troupes in various places.
    Due to the relationship between creative methods and creative experience, shortcomings will inevitably arise in the creative process. The performance of the Music and Dance Troupe also provides many useful experiences in this regard. The problems found in the performance of the programs can be divided into the following aspects:
    First of all, in some dance programs, there are still some traces of paying more attention to accepting folk art from a formal point of view. For example, in the Single Drum Dance, Northeast Yangko, and Fan Dance, there are too many changes in the dance scenes, lacking plot or emotional basis, so that the ideology is not enough.
    In the Uygur dance "Plate Dance" and the female solo "Miao Song", this shortcoming is also more significant. Because the actors are not familiar with the living habits and psychological characteristics of fraternal ethnic groups, even though they put on Uyghur and Miao costumes and worked hard on the appearance or abstractly on the emotional lyrics, they are still not kind in image and have not grasped the expression methods and spiritual essence of fraternal ethnic groups' songs and dances in art.
    Emphasizing the profoundness and consistent development of the ideological emotions of the dance, and paying attention to the plot and emotional basis of the dance scenes does not mean that a lot of specific plots and content must be put into the dance. Because in these programs, we find that some places describe too much, lack a central clue, and are not concentrated enough, affecting the coordination and unity of content and form. For example, in the "Northeast Yangko," the frolic of four pairs of young men and women expressing love only leaves a deep impression on two pairs, so the content appears repetitive and cluttered, and it is also longer. The "Fan Dance" handles the characters' feelings too complicated, and there are too many technical tricks, exceeding the limits allowed by the form and subject matter. It is better to handle it more simple and pure.
    Secondly, in accepting folk song and dance heritage, there is still a lack of analysis and critical spirit in some places. For example, the old man and old woman in the "Northeast Yangko" have an overly ancient feeling in their dance steps and costumes.
    In terms of instrumental music, the attempts to improve the performance of national musical instruments and develop performance forms are good, but the reform of artistic performance forms should not be handled too simply. There are still many issues that need to be carefully studied. For example, in the Huqin Quartet, the balance of instrument volume and the writing of the music have not achieved the purpose of the quartet. Two instruments cannot be independent, and are basically solo and accompaniment, and the accompaniment's musical patterns are also dull.
    The combination of symphony orchestra and suona has more problems with the instruments themselves. The suona has many glissandos, the sound is free, and the intonation is difficult to match with Western instruments. To combine well, I am afraid that we have to continue to study the reform of instruments and performance methods. Whether the writing of the orchestra accompaniment can completely adopt Western processing methods is also a question.
    In general, developing new national song and dance art requires us to strengthen the study of socialist realism creative methods, and to intensify our efforts to persistently learn from the folk and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and to treat various specific issues cautiously in creation. As long as we persist in long-term practice, the work will be fruitful. The Northeast People's Art Theater Music and Dance Troupe has made great efforts in this regard, and the harvest is also significant. These programs are the achievements of their practice, and all have positive significance, and the masses welcome them.
    Learning from the Northeast People's Art Theater Music and Dance Troupe's spirit of adhering to the correct direction and creative experience is of great significance to the work of song and dance troupes across the country today. (Attached picture)

    坚持正确方向，发展民族的歌舞艺术
    ——谈东北人民艺术剧院音乐舞蹈团的演出
    叶林
    中国各民族的歌舞艺术有着长远的历史和优良的传统，是各民族精神财富的重要组成部分。无数优秀的民间艺人，是无限丰富的民间歌舞艺术的继承者与创造者。建立民族的新歌舞，必须与民族、民间的歌舞艺术传统衔接起来。首先将这些遗产加以学习和整理，然后再在这基础上求进一步的发展。这是一件复杂而艰巨的事业。目前各地文艺工作团经过整编，成立了不少以发展民族、民间歌舞为任务的歌舞团。这个工作刚在开始，由于思想、艺术水平的限制，方针虽然明确，但道路却是艰难的。在这过程中，任何一些成功或失败的经验都值得我们重视。从这一意义上，东北人民艺术剧院音乐舞蹈团这几年来的艺术实践与这次来北京的演出，就特别值得我们兴奋和重视。
    东北人民艺术剧院音乐舞蹈团是一个具有较长历史的文艺战斗队伍，它的前身是东北音乐工作团和鲁迅艺术学院文艺工作团，即后来的鲁迅艺术学院音乐工作团。自一九五一年十月东北人民艺术剧院成立后建团到现在，也有了靠近两年的工作历史。这些年来，由于这个团有着过去文艺工作团战斗的优良传统，工作的专业分工也较早，加上音乐舞蹈团同志们几年来对学习民间艺术的坚持不懈，使新的节目不断出现，他们的工作是有成绩的。从这次带来北京演出的二十八个节目当中，我们可以看出，大部分节目都有着一种发展民间歌舞艺术的良好的意图，说明了他们在继承传统方面的钻研精神是刻苦的，并且为进一步的实践积累了经验。
    从舞蹈部分的六个节目来看，除了扇子舞与盘子舞系向兄弟文艺工作团学来的以外，其余的四个节目，全都是在民间优秀艺人的指导下集体编排出来的，每个舞蹈都有了发展。特别是在民间艺人范景田指导下排出来的单鼓舞与民间艺人徐延来指导下排的花鼓，都显出了一种特别鲜明的民间风格与力量，保留了一种异常珍贵的民间舞蹈的特有的节奏，使人感到亲切。至于在民间艺人刘升诚指导下排的东北大秧歌，则是将快要失传的民间舞蹈保留下来了，并且赋予了新的内容，这种做法也都是很好的。
    在器乐部分的四个节目中，也有着发掘与发展民族乐器以至改进它们的演奏形式的明显意图。他们使用古筝与二胡合奏；并且改造了胡琴，根据它们的大小与音色，处理成胡琴四重奏。在中西乐器结合的尝试上，他们大胆地用管弦乐队来替唢呐伴奏，并且让民间艺人王文洲担任唢呐独奏者。
    在发展与提高民间艺术形式的实践中，最令人满意的是山东琴书“大刚与小兰”和“梁山伯与祝英台下山”。该团的演唱组远在吕骥同志领导东北音乐工作团的时候就已经成立，并且获得了较大的关心，几年来，由于这几位演员的努力，不断地在内容上、音乐上与演唱表现方法上力求改进，成绩是显著的。目前这个节目在演唱形式上已经达到了相当完整的地步，他们用丰富的演唱技巧，表达了人物的性格与情绪的变化，表情与演唱的结合也很自然；此外在伴奏的加工方面也都取得了协调一致的效果，成为一种提高了的新的民族演唱形式。
    此外，在合唱方面，“太阳出来满天红”是他们吸收了二人转的曲调特点创作出来的，合唱队虽然由于人数与音量方面有些限制，但在表现感情上是有长处的，充满了生活的气息与热情；民歌齐唱
    “放风筝”则更是一种民歌演唱方法的很好的尝试。
    这些节目非常突出地说明了他们向民间学习的精神，和在民间艺术的基础上发展民族新歌舞的孜孜不倦的尝试。这些实践所接触的面是如此地广泛，说明了这个团的生命力是蓬勃的。在这过程中，他们工作的最大特点之一是与民间艺人的通力合作。他们请老艺人作老师，吸收青年艺人参加团的工作，都起了很大作用。艺人不仅指导排练，传授技艺，而且往往还同台演出。节目在演出时很受欢迎，这就大大地鼓舞了他们学习民间的信心。这都说明了音乐舞蹈团的努力与工作方向都是对的，值得我们各地的歌舞团学习。
    由于创作方法与创作经验的关系，在创作过程中也必然要产生缺点。音乐舞蹈团的演出，在这方面也提供了许多有益的经验。在节目的演出中，所发现的问题约可分为下列的几方面：
    首先，在一些舞蹈节目中还有着一些较多注意从形式上接受民间艺术的痕迹。如单鼓舞、东北大秧歌、扇子舞中，舞蹈场面的变化太多，缺少情节或情绪上的根据，以至思想性显得不够。
    在维吾尔族舞蹈“盘子舞”与女声独唱“苗家之歌”中，这方面的缺点也是较显著的。由于演员不熟悉兄弟民族的生活习惯与心理特征，尽管穿上了维族与苗族的服装，在外形上或抽象地在歌词情绪上用过功夫，然而在形象上还是不亲切的，在艺术上也未能掌握兄弟民族歌舞的表现方法与精神实质。
    强调舞蹈思想情绪的深刻性与发展上的一贯性，注意舞蹈场面的情节与情绪上的根据，并不是说必须在舞蹈上放进很多具体情节与内容。因为在这些节目中，我们发现有些地方描述太多，缺乏中心线索，反而不够集中，影响了内容与形式的协调与统
    一性。如“东北大秧歌”里面四对青年男女表现爱悦的嬉戏，只有两对给人印象较深，因而内容显得重复和芜杂，也较冗长。“扇子舞”把人物心情处理得也嫌过于复杂，技术性的花样多了一些，超过了形式与题材所容许的限度，倒不如处理得更朴实和单纯一些的好。
    其次，在接受民间歌舞遗产当中，有一些地方分析批判的精神还显得不足。如“东北大秧歌”中的老大爷老太婆，舞步与服装就有过于古老的感觉。
    在器乐方面，改进民族器乐性能与发展演出形式的尝试都是好的，但对待艺术演奏形式的改革，还不宜处理得过于简单化，这里面还有许多问题尚须谨慎研究。如胡琴四重奏这次在乐器音量的均衡与乐曲的写法上，都未能达到四重奏的目的，有两件乐器不能独立，基本上还是独奏与伴奏，伴奏的音型也嫌呆板。
    管弦乐与唢呐的配合，乐器本身存在的问题较多。唢呐很多滑音，发音自由，音律与西洋乐器也难一致。要结合得好，恐怕还得在乐器的改革与表现方法上继续研究。乐队伴奏的写法是否能完全采用西洋的处理方法也还是一个问题。
    总的来说，发展民族新歌舞艺术，需要我们加强社会主义现实主义创作方法的学习，需要加紧刻苦地坚持学习民间与学习苏联的先进经验，在创作中谨慎对待各种具体问题。只要在长期的实践中坚持下去，工作是会有成绩的。东北人民艺术剧院音乐舞蹈团在这方面已经尽了很大的努力，收获也是显著的。这些节目都是他们实践的成绩，而且都具有积极的意义，群众是欢迎的。
    学习东北人民艺术剧院音乐舞蹈团坚持正确方向的精神与创作经验，对目前全国歌舞团的工作来说，是有着重要的意义的。（附图片）
