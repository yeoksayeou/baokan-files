    A Storm in a Teacup Over a Quilt
    Wang Ni
    After breakfast, Auntie Dang, the village women's representative, sent her daughter Cuiying to the neighbor's to fetch Third Squad Leader's quilt. Cuiying shouted as soon as she entered, "Third Squad Leader! Third Squad Leader!" Third Squad Leader Li Fangchen, who was just about to attend his literacy class, met Cuiying at the door. Cuiying said, "My mom said to bring your quilt over to be taken apart and washed."

    "Cuiying! Tell your mom, thank you for her kindness, my quilt is still clean!" Third Squad Leader said this, but he was thinking: He shouldn't have let her see him airing the quilt yesterday. The quilt does need to be taken apart and washed, but he just doesn't have the time…

    "No!" Cuiying said anxiously, "My mom said, it must be taken apart, a dirty quilt is unsanitary, and you'll get sick if you sleep with it!"

    Third Squad Leader tried to reason with her, but Cuiying insisted, pouting and grabbing Third Squad Leader, not letting him leave. One of the soldiers spoke up, "Give it to her, Squad Leader! Don't you remember when you mended socks last time, we each handed over a pair, and she was still displeased!"

    Third Squad Leader had no choice. He thought, "I can't let the old aunt work for nothing!" He turned to Cuiying and said, "Alright, I'll go get it!" Cuiying smiled, and the soldiers laughed along. One soldier joked, "Cuiying, you've completed your mission!" Cuiying smiled and ran out with the quilt in her arms, bumping into Fan Juhua, who was just about to enter.

    Juhua had just returned from school and couldn't avoid bumping into Cuiying, taking a step back and saying, "Why are you in such a hurry!" Cuiying turned her head and smiled, about to run, but was grabbed by the quick-eyed Juhua:

    "Sister Cuiying! Whose quilt are you carrying?"

    "Third Squad Leader's, I'm taking it to be taken apart and washed." Cuiying said, glancing back at Third Squad Leader, who was walking out with his textbooks.

    "You can take it apart and wash it?..." Before Juhua could finish, Cuiying quickly explained, "No, my mom is going to take it apart and wash it!"

    "My mom can also take it apart and wash it," Juhua said, "My mom said so yesterday when Third Squad Leader was airing his quilt. Don't believe me? Ask Third Squad Leader!"

    Third Squad Leader was just about to speak when Cuiying said, "What difference does it make who takes it apart and washes it! Your mom can wash it next time!"

    Juhua rushed forward, "Next time? We can't let anyone else take it apart and wash it!" Cuiying was not happy with this sentence, and she immediately retorted, "Who is anyone else?"

    Juhua knew she had misspoke and quickly explained, "Don't be angry, I meant: Since the troops are staying in my home, we can't let another family take the quilt apart and wash it!"

    "My mom said that she is a women's representative and should take the lead in everything." Cuiying calmly explained, but Juhua pouted, looking as if she had suffered a bellyful of grievances, hugging the quilt and refusing to let go. Third Squad Leader watched the two children arguing and couldn't get out of the situation. The soldiers tried to persuade one and then the other, but Cuiying and Juhua each held on, each feeling they were right. Cuiying thought: "My mom is a women's representative and should take the lead in everything." Juhua felt more and more aggrieved: "Third Squad Leader lives in my house, but the quilt is being taken apart and washed by another family. The teacher often tells us: We should help the Liberation Army uncles..." Third Squad Leader bent down to persuade Juhua, "Let your Sister Cuiying take it this time! Next time, we'll definitely let your family wash it..." Juhua cried softly, and Third Squad Leader saw a tear fall on her bright red scarf. Just then, Juhua's mom—the landlady, Auntie Fan—came out. Third Squad Leader stroked Juhua's head and explained the situation to Auntie. Auntie saw the two children, one crying and the other silent.

    Auntie smiled and said, "Actually, the children are both right. You're staying in our home, and it's not right to let Auntie Dang take the quilt apart and wash it. It's not like we don't know how to support the army. Besides, her aunt is a women's representative, and it's right to take the lead. She's busy enough every day! But since she took it first, and Cuiying won't let go. I think, Juhua, you should let go. Let your Sister Cuiying take it this time. There are many comrades, and we'll have plenty to wash."

    After her mom said this, Juhua reluctantly let go, and Cuiying turned and left with the quilt.

    Third Squad Leader was troubled by this incident for a long time. He thought: I can only lead the comrades to help the villagers more; in order to protect these beloved people, study hard! Work hard! (Attached picture)

    一条被子引起的风波
    王倪
    早饭后，村妇联代表党大娘打发女儿翠英去隔壁，要三班长的被子。翠英一进门就喊：“三班长！三班长！”三班长李芳臣正准备去上文化课，在门口迎住了翠英，翠英说：“我妈说，叫把你的被子拿去拆洗。”
    “翠英！告诉你妈，谢谢她老人家，我的被子还干净着哩！”三班长嘴里这么说，心里可嘀咕着：昨天晒被子不该让她看见，被子嘛，是该拆洗了，可就是没时间……
    “不！”翠英着急地说：“我妈说啦，一定要拆，被子脏了不卫生，叔叔盖上要生病！”
    三班长好说歹说，翠英一定不依，嘴鼓鼓的，拉住三班长不让走。一个战士开了腔：“给了吧，班长！你不记得上次缝袜底，咱们每人交出了一双，她老人家还老不高兴呢！”
    三班长再也没有办法，心想：“反正不能让老大娘白做！”扭头对翠英说：“好吧，我去拿！”翠英笑了，战士们也跟着笑起来，一个战士打趣地说：“翠英你这可算完成任务啦！”翠英笑嘻嘻地抱了被子就往外跑，不提防和刚要进门的樊菊花碰了怀。
    菊花刚刚放学回来，她避也避不及让翠英给撞了一下，后退了一步说：“看把你急的！”翠英扭头一笑，拔脚要跑，却被眼快的菊花一把拉住：
    “翠英姐！你抱的谁的被子？”
    “三班长的，我拿去拆洗。”翠英一面说，回头望见三班长拿着课本往外走。
    “你还会拆洗？……”菊花还没说完，翠英急忙给解释：“不，是我妈要拆洗！”
    “我妈也能拆洗，”菊花说：“昨天三班长晒被子，我妈还说来，不信你问问三班长！”
    三班长刚想开口，翠英说：“谁拆洗还不一样！下次你妈拆洗吧！”
    菊花抢上去：“下次？哪次也不能让外人拆洗！”这句话说的翠英可不高兴了，她马上反问：“谁是外人？”
    菊花知道自己说失口了，连忙解释道：“你不要生气，我说的是：队伍住在我家里，被子就不能叫别家去拆洗！”
    “我妈说啦，她是妇联代表，凡事都应带头。”翠英冷静地解释着，菊花却像受了一肚子委曲似地鼓着个小嘴，抱住被子不放。三班长看着这两个孩子在争争吵吵，下不了台，战士们劝劝这个，又劝劝那个，但翠英和菊花一个不丢手，一个不放手，谁也觉得自己有理。翠英觉得：“我妈是妇联代表，凡事应该带头。”菊花越想越委曲：“三班长住在我家，被子却让别家拆洗。老师常给我们讲：应该帮助解放军叔叔……”三班长弯身劝菊花：“这回让你翠英姐拿去吧！下次一定让你家洗……”菊花轻声地哭了，三班长看见一滴热泪掉在鲜艳的红领巾上。正在这当儿，菊花的妈——房东樊大娘出来了。三班长抚摸着菊花的头，把事情讲给大娘听，大娘看见两个孩子，一个在哭，一个一声不响。
    大娘笑了笑说：“本来，孩子们都说的对，你们住在咱家，让她党大婶给拆洗被子，这个理可说不过去。咱可也不是不懂得拥护军队，再说，她婶是妇联代表，带头是正理，一天可真够忙！但是这次既然是她先拿去，翠英又不让。我看，菊花，那你就丢手吧，这回让你翠英姐拿去，同志们多啦，咱们还有的洗。”
    经妈这样一说，菊花才恋恋不舍地放了手，翠英转身抱着被子走了。
    三班长为这事好久心里不宁静，他想：我只有带动同志们，更多地帮助老乡；为了保卫这些亲爱的人，努力学习！积极工作！（附图片）
