Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 29th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on many fronts in the eastern, central, and Kaesong sectors began withdrawing from the demilitarized zone on the 28th.

　　At 4:30 AM on the 28th, Korean People's Army units on the "Heartbreak Ridge" front in the eastern sector began withdrawing from the demilitarized zone. Countless tons of food and ammunition were the first to retreat. Squads of well-armed soldiers walked along the winding roads of the green mountains towards the hills north of the northern edge of the demilitarized zone. Then, a team of artillerymen appeared, followed by a team of heavy machine gunners, carrying heavy gun barrels, heavy machine guns, and boxes of ammunition northward. The July sun shone on the endless stream of people. Gun barrels and tin ammunition boxes sparkled in the sun. Soldiers preparing for the final withdrawal from the demilitarized zone stood guard for the units that withdrew first. They waved goodbye to their comrades who were withdrawing north and vigilantly watched for possible sabotage from the other side.

　　On the morning of the 28th, Chinese People's Volunteer Army units on various positions on the Shangganling front north of Kimhwa in the central sector also began withdrawing from the demilitarized zone. Bugle calls sounded throughout the positions, and the first batch of soldiers to withdraw from the demilitarized zone marched off the various positions in formation, singing songs of peace. Artillery observers on the forward positions also carried their artillery telescopes and retreated north of the northern edge of the demilitarized zone. At the same time, our army's transporters also trod the narrow mountain paths, crossed steep mountain ridges, and transported large quantities of ammunition and supplies from the warehouses out of the demilitarized zone. Our army's telephone operators have also begun to dismantle some of the telephone lines on various mountain tops and roads, preparing to erect them on new positions north of the demilitarized zone.

　　On the 29th, various units of the Volunteer Army on the Kaesong front also began withdrawing from the demilitarized zone. Soldiers carried out large quantities of well-preserved ammunition from the foot of the mountains and underground fortifications, and bundled up the temporary tents. Supplies piled up on the side of the road like small hills, waiting to be loaded onto vehicles. All kinds of artillery were also pushed onto the road from all directions. Many soldiers wrote inscriptions in places where they had fought bloody battles to commemorate them. One place had a poem written: "We stormed Renzanbao in those years, Severely annihilated the American and Rhee forces and made great contributions, Abiding by the armistice to leave the mountain, The names of heroes are higher than the mountain." At 3:00 PM, vehicles and horses pulling artillery and carrying supplies gathered from all directions onto a road and withdrew beyond the northern edge of the demilitarized zone. The infantry, carrying all their equipment, had already left the demilitarized zone. By this point, except for the engineering units clearing dangerous objects and a small number of personnel designated to explain the situation to the civilian police in the demilitarized zone, the withdrawing troops on the Kaesong front were entering new positions north of the northern edge of the demilitarized zone.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 29th: According to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the ten Joint Observer Teams responsible for assisting the Military Armistice Commission in supervising the implementation of the clauses of the Armistice Agreement regarding the demilitarized zone and the estuary of the Han River are scheduled to depart on July 30th to carry out their tasks.

　　At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on July 27th, both sides agreed to divide the demilitarized zone and the estuary of the Han River into ten sections, to be stationed by ten Joint Observer Teams respectively. At the staff meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on July 29th, both sides reached an agreement on specific issues regarding how the Joint Observer Teams would carry out their tasks, such as the specific division of the ten sections, the departure date of each Joint Observer Team, the limit on the number of personnel from both sides for each Joint Observer Team, and the time and location of their first meeting.

    朝中人民部队开始撤离非军事区
    军事停战委员会联合观察小组出发工作
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】朝鲜东线、中线和开城前线的许多阵地上的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在二十八日开始撤离非军事区。
    二十八日清晨四时半，东线“伤心岭”前线的朝鲜人民军部队开始撤离非军事区。无数吨粮食和弹药首先向后撤退。一队队武装整齐的战士沿着绿山中蜿蜒的道路向非军事区北缘以北的山头走去。接着，一队炮兵出现了，一队重机枪手出现了，他们扛着沉重的炮管、重机枪和一箱箱的弹药向北走去。七月的阳光照着无尽的人流。炮身和铁皮子弹箱在阳光下闪闪发光。准备最后撤出非军事区的战士们为首先撤出的部队担任警戒。他们向正在北撤的战友们扬手告别，并且警惕地注视着可能来自对方的破坏行动。
    二十八日早晨，中线金化以北上甘岭前线各处阵地上的中国人民志愿军部队，也开始了撤离非军事区。阵地上军号声响成一片，第一批撤离非军事区的战士们，唱着和平之歌整队走下了各个阵地。前沿阵地上的炮兵观测员们也扛着炮队镜向非军事区北缘以北撤退。与此同时，我军运输员们，也踏着羊肠山道，翻越险峻山岭，把仓库里的大批弹药物资搬运出非军事区。我军电话员们也已开始在各个山头上和道路上收拆一部分电线，准备把它架到非军事区以北的新阵地上去。
    二十九日，开城前线志愿军各部也开始撤离非军事区。战士们从山脚和地下工事里搬出大批保存得很好的弹药，捆起临时搭盖的帐篷。堆在路旁像小山一样的物资，等候装车。各种大炮也从四面八方推上公路。许多战士在曾经血战过的地方题词留念，有一个地方写着一首诗：“当年杀上仁山包，痛歼美李立功劳，遵守停战把山下，英雄名字比山高。”下午三时，牵引大炮和载运物资的车辆和骏马，从四面八方集结到一条公路上，向非军事区北缘以外撤离。步兵携带着全部装备，已离开了非军事区。至此，开城前线非军事区内除了正在清除危险物的工兵部队和被指定向非军事区民政警察交代情况的少数人员外，撤离的部队正进入非军事区北缘以北的新阵地。
    【新华社开城二十九日电】根据朝鲜停战协定的规定，负责协助军事停战委员会监督停战协定中关于非军事区与汉江口各条款之执行的十个联合观察小组，定于七月三十日全部出发执行其任务。
    在七月二十七日的军事停战委员会上，双方已同意将非军事区与汉江口分为十个地段，由十个联合观察小组分别驻扎。七月二十九日的军事停战委员会参谋人员会议上，双方又已就十个地段的如何具体划分，各联合观察小组的出发日期，每一联合观察小组双方人员人数的限额，及其第一次会晤的时间与地点等，有关联合观察小组如何执行其任务的具体问题取得协议。
