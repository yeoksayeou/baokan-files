Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The recent powerful counter-attack launched by the Korean and Chinese People's forces south of Kim Seong on the central Korean front inflicted significant losses on the Li Seung-man bandit gang and the U.S. invading forces that rushed to its aid. News published by U.S. news agencies revealed the enemy troops' disorganized and miserable situation.

When our forces launched their counterattack, the Li puppet army and the U.S. artillery that came to support it retreated in a panic. A United Press dispatch stated: "When the South Korean army abandoned thousands of trucks, tanks, and artillery pieces and retreated early Tuesday morning, many units lost contact and transportation equipment." An International News Service reporter witnessed the Li puppet army "fleeing in disarray" under our forces' counterattack. He said: "South Korean artillery units abandoned their cannons on the muddy roads, tripping some fleeing infantrymen. Ammunition was scattered all over the ground." However, our forces' artillery fire did not give the enemy any chance to breathe. The Associated Press admitted: "Before the Communist forces attacked, they fired intense artillery and mortar fire, which American officers serving in the South Korean army described as unbelievably fierce." "Artillery fire cut off telephone lines, killed communicators, destroyed radio stations, and severed communications." Under our forces' fierce attacks, the Li puppet army suffered heavy casualties. United Press reported that "the total number of wounded carried by air force ambulance planes in one day was only less than two other days since the outbreak of the Korean War. Transport planes, which are usually used to transport military supplies, were also dispatched to carry large numbers of wounded." Li Seung-man did not expect that shouting for "Northward Advance" would result in such a severe blow and was extremely annoyed. United Press reported from Seoul: "Li Seung-man is very 'uneasy' because the South Korean army 'has been wiped out so much' and retreated so far." The Li bandit hurriedly rushed to the front line to "inspect," but the Li puppet army still collapsed as before. U.S. artillery complained that the Li puppet army "ran away without warning."

The U.S. invading forces, which were supposed to support the Li puppet army in combat, also suffered significant losses in the fighting. An International News Service reporter sent a telegram from the front line saying: "Many American advisors in the South Korean army have not returned from this brutal battle." One artillery battalion was completely annihilated by our forces. The Associated Press reported that this artillery battalion "had at least three hundred Americans killed or missing. Others returned in twos and threes. They dazedly recounted how their comrades died beside them."

    美国通讯社承认敌军狼狈溃退损失惨重
    【新华社二十日讯】最近朝中人民部队在朝鲜中线金城以南发起的强大反击战中，使李承晚匪帮和赶忙来援助它的美国侵略军遭受了重大的损失。美国通讯社发表的新闻，透露了敌军狼狈不堪的情形。
    当我军发起反击的时候，李伪军和为着支援李伪军而来的美国炮兵慌忙溃退。合众社电称：“韩国军队星期二清晨放弃了数以千计的卡车、坦克和大炮实行退却的时候，很多部队失掉了他们的联络和运输设备。”国际新闻社记者目睹李伪军在我军反击下“狼狈地逃窜”，他说：“南朝鲜军炮队把大炮丢弃在泥泞的路上，把一些逃跑的步兵绊倒。弹药洒满地上。”然而我军的炮火并没有给敌人一点喘息的机会。美联社承认：“共军在进攻之前发射了猛烈的大炮和迫击炮火，在韩军中服务的美国军官形容炮火的猛烈令人难以置信。”“大炮炮火切断了电话线，击毙了通讯员，击坏了电台并切断了联络。”在我军猛烈打击下，李伪军伤亡惨重。合众社报道说“空军救护机一天所载的伤员总数，是朝鲜战争爆发以来，仅少于另外两天的最多的一天。平常用来运输军需物资的运输机，也被派去载运大批伤员。”李承晚想不到高叫“北进”的结果会遭到这么严重的打击，懊恼异常。合众社从汉城发出消息说：“李承晚很感‘不安’，因为南朝鲜军队‘被消灭那么多’，并且败退了那么远。”李匪急急忙忙赶到前线去“视察”，但是李伪军还是照样垮下来。美炮兵怨恨李伪军“不警告一声就跑掉了”。
    所谓支援李伪军作战的美国侵略军也在战斗中遭到了重大的损失。国际新闻社记者从前线发出电报说：“南朝鲜部队中的许多美国顾问没有从这次残酷的战斗中回来。”有一个炮兵营被我军全部歼灭了。美联社电称，这个炮兵营“至少有三百个美国人被打死或者失了踪。另有一些人三三两两地回来。他们昏昏迷迷地叙述他们的同伴死在他们身旁的情形。”
