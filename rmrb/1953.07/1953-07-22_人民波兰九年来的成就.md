    The Achievements of People's Poland in the Past Nine Years
    Ambassador of the People's Republic of Poland to China, Kirilo
    It has been nine years since the day the invincible Soviet army and the Polish army fought side by side, driving the Hitlerite occupiers from Polish soil. Thanks to the glorious victory of the Soviet army, which brought liberation to all of Europe, the bloody rule of the Hitlerite bandits, which caused the tragic deaths of more than six million of our people, came to an end, and Poland gained independence. But this time it was not a restoration of the old regime, but a national and social liberation. With the establishment of the people's regime, millions of working people in our country gained true freedom for the first time. This was the result of the heroic struggle of the Polish Communist Party in the twenty years after the end of the First World War and before the start of the Second World War, and the resistance movement launched by the people under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party (i.e. the Polish Communist Party) during the period of occupation. Under the leadership of the Party and its leader, Comrade Bierut, the working people are closely united around the working class. People's Poland has thus grown up, and a new era in Polish history has begun - a new era of friendly alliance with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, a new era of linking with the international workers' movement and the powerful peace movement, and a new era of fundamentally changing the people's lives and making the people truly masters of their own affairs.
    Last year, the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland was adopted and implemented. This Constitution is based on our new economic structure, and on the strong foundation of the victory of new class relations and social reforms.
    In the past nine years, we have implemented land reform, abolished landlord land ownership, and thus ended the tragic fate of millions of peasants; we have created conditions to guide more than three million peasant households towards the socialist economic path.
    During the nine years of managing major industrial and mining enterprises in our country, we have transformed an agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country; it already has its own huge industrial base, has achieved important achievements, and has great potential for unlimited development.
    In nine years, the social phenomenon of illiteracy has been eliminated, the number of university students has tripled, the number of ordinary schools and scientific and research institutions has increased even more, and the number of newspapers and books published has increased many times. We have laid the foundation for the further development of cultural and educational undertakings and created a new Polish culture - a culture with national form and socialist content.
    We have completely changed the tragic phenomenon in the countryside in these nine years. Our industry has absorbed millions of formerly unemployed peasants. We have greatly improved the living standards of the working class. We have built many new houses, schools, hospitals, theaters, cultural palaces, shops and parks.
    In nine years, we have grown stronger and have further closely united with the countries of the world peace camp. We have become an important link in the front against war; this front has enough power to crush all the provocative conspiracies of imperialism and consolidate our independence.
    In the past, landlords and big capitalists, who occupied 40 percent of the country's cultivated land, ruled Poland, and millions of peasants in rural areas suffered cruel exploitation by landlords and lived a painful life. The land reform implemented after liberation enabled peasants to obtain more than 6 million hectares of land, and the average land owned by each peasant has increased from 0.9 hectares to 1.5 hectares. Although the agricultural population has decreased by almost half, due to the peasants' enthusiasm for production after being allocated land, and the government's assistance to peasants with loans, fertilizers, and agricultural tools, our agricultural production has exceeded the pre-war level.
    Land reform and industrial development have created conditions for the gradual transition of rural areas to a collective economy. In the movement of production cooperation, the number of peasants joining agricultural production cooperatives on a voluntary basis has increased day by day. According to statistics as of July 1 this year, among the 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, 3,000 were newly established in the first half of 1953. The number of members of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has reached 200,000. These agricultural production cooperatives have proved the superiority of the socialist economy to individual farmers.
    Industrial output has reached three times that of pre-war levels, with heavy industry developing even faster. In the eight years from 1946 to the end of 1953, the output of our industrial products will be more than that produced between 1920 and 1939.
    Now it can be said that we already have a new industry, because the old factories such as the Bierut Smelting Plant in Czestochowa and the truck manufacturing factory in Starachowice have been completely rebuilt and expanded.
    After liberation, we founded many industries that Poland did not have before the war. We have developed shipbuilding, electrical machinery, chemical, machinery, and machine tool industries; we have greatly improved the productivity of various old mines and opened new mines; we have expanded the industrial base and provided more and more villages with electricity; we have rebuilt and developed domestic and foreign airlines. The level of industrial production in the first half of 1953, calculated per capita, has caught up with France and exceeded Italy by a lot. But our six-year plan is only halfway through. The six-year plan will especially develop the industry of means of production. By 1955, machine production will increase by 3.6 times and will account for 14% of the total industrial output.
    The six-year plan will greatly develop heavy industry. According to the six-year plan, steel production will increase to 3.2 times the pre-war level, with an annual output of 4.6 million tons of steel. Due to the establishment of eleven new coal mines and the mechanization of old coal mines, the annual coal production will reach 100 million tons.
    The output of the chemical industry will increase by 3.5 times and become the second largest national industry after the coal mining industry.
    Due to the construction of fourteen new steam power plants and many hydroelectric power plants, electricity production will increase to five times the pre-war level. The annual power generation will be 20 billion kilowatt-hours.
    During the six-year plan period, 1,425 giant enterprises will be built, including 250 of the most modern factories and 90 residential areas.
    The political awareness of the working people is constantly improving during the implementation of the six-year plan. In mid-1952, workers put forward a total of 200,000 rationalization proposals.
    In terms of culture, the improvement of people's thinking is difficult to see from the figures. But examples can also be given as follows: this year about 87 percent of children enter seven-year primary schools; the number of university students per thousand people is two and a half times that of the United Kingdom; rural newspapers have been issued more than one million copies; thousands of villages have permanent cinemas - all of which illustrate the cultural revolution that is being carried out throughout the country. This shows that this country, which once gave birth to great geniuses such as Copernicus, Chopin, Mickiewicz, and Curie-Skłodowska, after centuries of dark rule by exploiters and foreign oppressors, now stands proudly and happily in the ranks of the countries in the peace and socialism camp.
    Although we are not the richest country, we have greatly improved the living standards of the people. For example, before the war, the working people of Poland lived in dilapidated huts, and now more than 100,000 new houses are built for the working people in various cities and towns every year. Before the war, only the rich could afford medical treatment, but now all employees except farmers enjoy health insurance - along with their families, 10 million people enjoy this benefit. The consumption of various items per capita has increased a lot, and the increase in light industry and agricultural products will further improve the living standards of the broad masses of people.
    The Soviet Union's victory in the anti-fascist world war has rapidly changed the face of the world; thanks to our own achievements, we have become a powerful link in the world peace fortress headed by the Soviet Union. Now our country is surrounded by peaceful borders, and we have established fraternal and friendly relations with our neighboring countries. Although counter-revolutionary and aggressive forces have no foothold in our country, we must constantly be vigilant in order to thwart all conspiracies that attempt to undermine our security and peace, because of the existence of class enemies and capitalist encirclement. If aggressive adventurers dare to carry out anti-peace conspiracies in People's Poland, they will surely suffer a shameful defeat. Any provocation against the people's motherland and against peace is self-destruction. The Polish people are forming an alliance with their powerful friends, firmly defending the territory of their motherland and world peace.
    The above is our achievement in the past nine years.
    How did we achieve these results? First, we should thank the United Workers' Party that leads us forward. Armed with the invincible theory of Marxism-Leninism, the Party has learned the lessons of heroic history and the valuable experience of the great Lenin and Stalin Party.
    Second, we should thank the enthusiasm of the working class and all the liberated people; they work selflessly and actively participate in the struggle for a better future.
    Third, it should be attributed to the new type of relationship established between our country and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries. This relationship has never existed between capitalist countries. The selfless assistance given to us by the Soviet Union is the guarantee of all our achievements. This new type of relationship, which unites 800 million new life builders from the Baltic Sea to the Yellow Sea in unbreakable friendship, makes the peaceful and democratic countries closely united in one big family.
    The achievements of each of our countries are also the achievements of the entire peace camp; and the achievements of friendly countries are also our achievements. Therefore, millions of Polish people are watching the great transformation of People's China with great enthusiasm; similarly, tens of millions of Chinese people are also concerned about the development of our national economy and cultural undertakings. Therefore, the performances of the Polish "Mazowsze" song and dance troupe in China were very successful; and the Chinese novel "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" was warmly welcomed in Poland. Because today, although our liberated countries are far apart from each other, our goals, the cause of maintaining peace and building a new life, and the unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union are common and consistent.

    人民波兰九年来的成就
    波兰人民共和国驻华大使  基里洛克
    自从不可战胜的苏联军队与波兰军并肩作战，把希特勒占领者由波兰土地上驱除出去那天起，到现在已有九年了。由于光荣的苏军的胜利，给全欧洲带来了解放，从此结束了使我国六百多万人口惨遭杀害的希特勒匪帮的血腥统治；使波兰获得了独立。但这一次并不是旧政权的复辟，而是民族的和社会的解放。由于人民政权的建立，我国数百万劳动人民第一次得到了真正的自由。这是波兰共产党在第一次世界大战结束以后至第二次大战开始时的二十年内英勇斗争以及人民于沦陷期间在波兰工人党（即波兰共产党）领导下展开抵抗运动的结果。在党和它的领袖贝鲁特同志的领导之下，劳动人民紧紧地团结在工人阶级的周围。人民波兰就这样地成长了起来，从此波兰的历史开始了一个新的纪元——与苏联、中国和各人民民主国家同盟友好的新纪元，与国际工人运动和强大的保卫和平运动联结在一起的新纪元，彻底改变人民生活并使人民真正当家做主的新纪元。
    去年，波兰人民共和国宪法已被通过实施了。这
    一宪法，是建立在我国新的经济结构，建立在新的阶级关系与社会改革胜利的强固基础之上的。
    在过去九年中，我们实行了土地改革，废除了地主的土地所有制，因而结束了千万农民的悲惨命运；我们创造了引导三百多万户的农民走向社会主义经济道路的条件。
    在我们国家经营重大工矿企业的九年期间，我们已把一个农业—工业国转变成为工业—农业国；它已拥有自己的巨大的工业基地，已获得了重要的成就，并且有无限发展的巨大潜力。
    在九年中，已经消除了文盲的社会现象，大学学生的数目增加了两倍，普通学校和科学与研究机构的数目增加得更多，报纸和书籍出版的数量增加了好几倍。我们为进一步发展文教事业奠定了基础，并创造了新的波兰文化——具有民族形式和社会主义内容的文化。
    我们在这九年中已完全改变了乡村中的悲惨现象。我们的工业吸收了数百万从前失业的农民。我们大大地提高了工人阶级的生活水平。我们已建造了许多新的住房、学校、医院、剧院、文化宫、商店和公园。
    我们在九年中壮大了自己，并进一步与世界和平阵营各国紧密地团结在一起。我们已成为反对战争的阵线上的重要一环；这一个阵线有足够的力量来粉碎帝国主义的一切挑衅阴谋，并使我们的独立得到巩固。
    从前占有全国耕地百分之四十的地主与大资本家统治着波兰，因而农村中有数百万农民受到地主的残酷剥削而过着痛苦的生活。解放后所实行的土地改革使农民得到六百多万公顷的土地，平均每一农民所有的土地已由○·九公顷增至一·五公顷。虽然农业人口已减少了几乎一半，但由于农民在分得土地以后所表现的生产热情，与政府给予农民以贷款、肥料和农具等的协助，使得我国的农业生产量已超出了战前的水平。
    土地改革和工业的发展为农村逐渐走上集体经济的道路创造了条件。在生产合作的运动中，农民在自愿基础上加入农业生产合作社的数目日见加多。根据今年七月一日的统计，在全国八千个农业生产合作社中，有三千个是在一九五三年上半年新成立的。全国农业生产合作社社员的人数已达到二十万人。这些农业生产合作社向个体农民证明了社会主义经济的优越性。
    工业产量已达到战前的三倍，其中重工业发展得更快。从一九四六年到一九五三年年底为止的八年中，我们工业产品的产量，将比一九二○年到一九三九年间所出产的还要多。
    现在可以说，我们已经有了新的工业，因为旧有的工厂如捷斯托科发的贝鲁特冶炼厂和斯他罗赫维切的卡车制造工厂都已完全改建并扩大了。
    解放后，我们创立了许多波兰战前未有过的工业。我们发展了造船、电机、化学、机器和母机等工业；我们大大提高了各种旧有矿坑的生产力，并开掘了新矿；我们扩充了工业基地，并使越来越多的乡村得到电力；我们重建和发展了国内外航线。一九五三年前半年的工业生产水平，若以每一人口计算则已赶上法国并超出了意大利很多。但是我们的六年计划还只是在中途。六年计划将特别发展生产资料的工业。到一九五五年时，机器生产将提高到三点六倍，并将占工业总产量的百分之十四。
    六年计划将大大发展重工业。按照六年计划的规定，钢的产量将增加到战前水平的三点二倍，每年将产钢四百六十万吨。由于十一个新煤井的设立和旧有煤矿的机械化，煤的年产量将达到一亿吨。
    化学工业的产量将提高到三点五倍，而成为仅次于采煤工业的第二个规模巨大的国家工业。
    由于建筑了十四个新的蒸汽发电厂和许多水力发电厂，电力产量将提高为战前的五倍。每年发电量将为二百亿瓩时。
    六年计划期间将建设一千四百二十五个巨型企业，其中有二百五十个最现代化的工厂和九十个住宅区。
    劳动人民的政治觉悟在执行六年计划期间正不断提高，一九五二年中工人提出的合理化建议共达二十万件。
    在文化方面，人民思想的提高是难以从数字中看出来的。但也可举例如下：今年约有百分之八十七的儿童进入七年制小学；每一千个人内大学生的人数为英国的二倍半；农村报纸已发行了一百万份以上；数千个乡村都有了固定性的电影院——这一切都说明全国正在开展的文化革命的情形。这表明了这个曾经诞生过哥白尼、萧邦、米茨凯维奇、居里·斯克多夫斯卡等伟大天才的国家，经过剥削者与外国压迫者几世纪来的黑暗统治以后，现在已骄傲地和愉快地站在和平与社会主义阵营各国的行列之中了。
    虽然我们还不是一个最富足的国家，但我们已大大地提高了人民的生活水平。再举例来说，战前波兰劳动人民住在破旧的小屋里，现在每年在各城镇为劳动人民建设了十万多间新住房。战前仅有富人治得起病，现在除农民外，所有职工都享受着健康保险——连同职工家属在内，有一千万人享受这种福利。每一人口对于各种物品的消费量已增加了很多，而且轻工业和农产品的增加，将进一步提高广大人民的生活水平。
    苏联在反法西斯世界大战中的胜利，迅速改变了世界的面貌；由于我们自己的成就，我们已成为以苏联为首的世界和平堡垒中的有力的一环。现在我国的四周都是和平的疆界，我们和各邻国建立了兄弟般的友好关系。虽然反革命的、侵略的力量已在我国站不住脚了，但由于阶级敌人和资本主义包围的存在，因而我们必须不断提高警惕，以粉碎一切企图破坏我们的安全与和平的阴谋。假如侵略冒险家敢于在人民波兰进行反和平的阴谋诡计，他们一定要遭到可耻的失败。任何反对人民祖国，反对和平的挑衅行为，都是自取灭亡。波兰人民正在和他们的强大朋友结成同盟，坚强地捍卫着祖国的疆土和世界和平。
    以上就是我们九年来的成就。
    我们是怎样获得了这些成绩的呢？第一，应该感谢领导我们向前迈进的统一工人党。以马克思—列宁主义的不可战胜的理论武装起来的党，吸取了英勇历史的教训和伟大的列宁、斯大林党的宝贵经验。
    第二，我们应感谢工人阶级和全体解放了的人民的热情；他们忘我地工作并积极地参加争取美好将来的斗争。
    第三，应归功于我国和苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家建立起来的新型的关系。这种关系是资本主义国家之间所从来没有过的。苏联给予我们的无私援助是我们一切成就的保证。这种新型的关系，把从波罗的海起到黄海的八亿新生活建设者凝结在牢不可破的友谊之中，使得各和平民主国家紧密地团结在一个大家庭里。
    我们每一个国家的成就也就是整个和平阵营的成就；而各友好国家的成就也就是我们的成就。因此，千百万的波兰人民，以伟大的热情来注视着人民中国的巨大转变；同样，千千万万的中国人民也在关心着我国国民经济和文化事业的发展。因此，波兰“玛佐夫舍”歌舞团在中国的演出获得了很大的成功；而中国小说“太阳照在桑乾河上”在波兰受到热烈的欢迎。因为今天我们解放了的国家虽然彼此距离很远，但我们彼此的目的、维护和平与建设新生活的事业以及与苏联的牢不可破的友谊却是共同的，一致的。
