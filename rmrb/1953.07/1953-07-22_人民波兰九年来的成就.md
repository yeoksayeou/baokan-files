    The Achievements of People's Poland in the Past Nine Years
    Ambassador of the People's Republic of Poland to China, Kirilo
    It has been nine years since the day the invincible Soviet army and the Polish army fought side by side, driving the Hitlerite occupiers from Polish soil. Thanks to the glorious victory of the Soviet army, which brought liberation to all of Europe, the bloody rule of the Hitlerite bandits, which caused the tragic deaths of more than six million of our people, came to an end, and Poland gained independence. But this time it was not a restoration of the old regime, but a national and social liberation. With the establishment of the people's regime, millions of working people in our country gained true freedom for the first time. This was the result of the heroic struggle of the Polish Communist Party in the twenty years after the end of the First World War and before the start of the Second World War, and the resistance movement launched by the people under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party (i.e. the Polish Communist Party) during the period of occupation. Under the leadership of the Party and its leader, Comrade Bierut, the working people are closely united around the working class. People's Poland has thus grown up, and a new era in Polish history has begun - a new era of friendly alliance with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, a new era of linking with the international workers' movement and the powerful peace movement, and a new era of fundamentally changing the people's lives and making the people truly masters of their own affairs.
    Last year, the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland was adopted and implemented. This Constitution is based on our new economic structure, and on the strong foundation of the victory of new class relations and social reforms.
    In the past nine years, we have implemented land reform, abolished landlord land ownership, and thus ended the tragic fate of millions of peasants; we have created conditions to guide more than three million peasant households towards the socialist economic path.
    During the nine years of managing major industrial and mining enterprises in our country, we have transformed an agricultural-industrial country into an industrial-agricultural country; it already has its own huge industrial base, has achieved important achievements, and has great potential for unlimited development.
    In nine years, the social phenomenon of illiteracy has been eliminated, the number of university students has tripled, the number of ordinary schools and scientific and research institutions has increased even more, and the number of newspapers and books published has increased many times. We have laid the foundation for the further development of cultural and educational undertakings and created a new Polish culture - a culture with national form and socialist content.
    We have completely changed the tragic phenomenon in the countryside in these nine years. Our industry has absorbed millions of formerly unemployed peasants. We have greatly improved the living standards of the working class. We have built many new houses, schools, hospitals, theaters, cultural palaces, shops and parks.
    In nine years, we have grown stronger and have further closely united with the countries of the world peace camp. We have become an important link in the front against war; this front has enough power to crush all the provocative conspiracies of imperialism and consolidate our independence.
    In the past, landlords and big capitalists, who occupied 40 percent of the country's cultivated land, ruled Poland, and millions of peasants in rural areas suffered cruel exploitation by landlords and lived a painful life. The land reform implemented after liberation enabled peasants to obtain more than 6 million hectares of land, and the average land owned by each peasant has increased from 0.9 hectares to 1.5 hectares. Although the agricultural population has decreased by almost half, due to the peasants' enthusiasm for production after being allocated land, and the government's assistance to peasants with loans, fertilizers, and agricultural tools, our agricultural production has exceeded the pre-war level.
    Land reform and industrial development have created conditions for the gradual transition of rural areas to a collective economy. In the movement of production cooperation, the number of peasants joining agricultural production cooperatives on a voluntary basis has increased day by day. According to statistics as of July 1 this year, among the 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, 3,000 were newly established in the first half of 1953. The number of members of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has reached 200,000. These agricultural production cooperatives have proved the superiority of the socialist economy to individual farmers.
    Industrial output has reached three times that of pre-war levels, with heavy industry developing even faster. In the eight years from 1946 to the end of 1953, the output of our industrial products will be more than that produced between 1920 and 1939.
    Now it can be said that we already have a new industry, because the old factories such as the Bierut Smelting Plant in Czestochowa and the truck manufacturing factory in Starachowice have been completely rebuilt and expanded.
    After liberation, we founded many industries that Poland did not have before the war. We have developed shipbuilding, electrical machinery, chemical, machinery, and machine tool industries; we have greatly improved the productivity of various old mines and opened new mines; we have expanded the industrial base and provided more and more villages with electricity; we have rebuilt and developed domestic and foreign airlines. The level of industrial production in the first half of 1953, calculated per capita, has caught up with France and exceeded Italy by a lot. But our six-year plan is only halfway through. The six-year plan will especially develop the industry of means of production. By 1955, machine production will increase by 3.6 times and will account for 14% of the total industrial output.
    The six-year plan will greatly develop heavy industry. According to the six-year plan, steel production will increase to 3.2 times the pre-war level, with an annual output of 4.6 million tons of steel. Due to the establishment of eleven new coal mines and the mechanization of old coal mines, the annual coal production will reach 100 million tons.
    The output of the chemical industry will increase by 3.5 times and become the second largest national industry after the coal mining industry.
    Due to the construction of fourteen new steam power plants and many hydroelectric power plants, electricity production will increase to five times the pre-war level. The annual power generation will be 20 billion kilowatt-hours.
    During the six-year plan period, 1,425 giant enterprises will be built, including 250 of the most modern factories and 90 residential areas.
    The political awareness of the working people is constantly improving during the implementation of the six-year plan. In mid-1952, workers put forward a total of 200,000 rationalization proposals.
    In terms of culture, the improvement of people's thinking is difficult to see from the figures. But examples can also be given as follows: this year about 87 percent of children enter seven-year primary schools; the number of university students per thousand people is two and a half times that of the United Kingdom; rural newspapers have been issued more than one million copies; thousands of villages have permanent cinemas - all of which illustrate the cultural revolution that is being carried out throughout the country. This shows that this country, which once gave birth to great geniuses such as Copernicus, Chopin, Mickiewicz, and Curie-Sk≈Çodowska, after centuries of dark rule by exploiters and foreign oppressors, now stands proudly and happily in the ranks of the countries in the peace and socialism camp.
    Although we are not the richest country, we have greatly improved the living standards of the people. For example, before the war, the working people of Poland lived in dilapidated huts, and now more than 100,000 new houses are built for the working people in various cities and towns every year. Before the war, only the rich could afford medical treatment, but now all employees except farmers enjoy health insurance - along with their families, 10 million people enjoy this benefit. The consumption of various items per capita has increased a lot, and the increase in light industry and agricultural products will further improve the living standards of the broad masses of people.
    The Soviet Union's victory in the anti-fascist world war has rapidly changed the face of the world; thanks to our own achievements, we have become a powerful link in the world peace fortress headed by the Soviet Union. Now our country is surrounded by peaceful borders, and we have established fraternal and friendly relations with our neighboring countries. Although counter-revolutionary and aggressive forces have no foothold in our country, we must constantly be vigilant in order to thwart all conspiracies that attempt to undermine our security and peace, because of the existence of class enemies and capitalist encirclement. If aggressive adventurers dare to carry out anti-peace conspiracies in People's Poland, they will surely suffer a shameful defeat. Any provocation against the people's motherland and against peace is self-destruction. The Polish people are forming an alliance with their powerful friends, firmly defending the territory of their motherland and world peace.
    The above is our achievement in the past nine years.
    How did we achieve these results? First, we should thank the United Workers' Party that leads us forward. Armed with the invincible theory of Marxism-Leninism, the Party has learned the lessons of heroic history and the valuable experience of the great Lenin and Stalin Party.
    Second, we should thank the enthusiasm of the working class and all the liberated people; they work selflessly and actively participate in the struggle for a better future.
    Third, it should be attributed to the new type of relationship established between our country and the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries. This relationship has never existed between capitalist countries. The selfless assistance given to us by the Soviet Union is the guarantee of all our achievements. This new type of relationship, which unites 800 million new life builders from the Baltic Sea to the Yellow Sea in unbreakable friendship, makes the peaceful and democratic countries closely united in one big family.
    The achievements of each of our countries are also the achievements of the entire peace camp; and the achievements of friendly countries are also our achievements. Therefore, millions of Polish people are watching the great transformation of People's China with great enthusiasm; similarly, tens of millions of Chinese people are also concerned about the development of our national economy and cultural undertakings. Therefore, the performances of the Polish "Mazowsze" song and dance troupe in China were very successful; and the Chinese novel "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" was warmly welcomed in Poland. Because today, although our liberated countries are far apart from each other, our goals, the cause of maintaining peace and building a new life, and the unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union are common and consistent.
