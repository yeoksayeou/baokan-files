Xinhua News Agency, London, June 6th (TASS dispatch): According to the "Daily Worker," the chairman of the Clydebank Trades Council and shop steward of "John Brown," Britain's largest shipyard, said in Glasgow: "Shipping depends on trade, and trade cannot be expanded if there is an embargo on some of the world's largest countries. Full trade with Russia and China would require ships. Measures prohibiting trade inevitably lead to a slump in the shipbuilding industry."

Finlay Hart, shop steward at Blythswood Shipbuilding in Clyde, said: "There is one remedy for the impending slump in the shipbuilding industry, and the key lies in a peaceful world and expanded trade."

Hart cited many figures illustrating how orders for the British shipbuilding industry are decreasing. In the first half of 1952, Clyde shipyards received orders to build a total of 57 ships, with a total tonnage of nearly 500,000 tons. In the same period in 1953, only ten ships were ordered, with a total tonnage of only 50,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 5th (TASS dispatch): According to newspapers, British Liberal Party leader Clement Davies, speaking in Yeovil, Somerset, said that Britain should trade freely with all countries. Davies said that Britain's only way out is unrestricted multilateral trade, "in other words, trade with all countries, and it must be free trade. Only those who have never respected Britain's interests and have single-mindedly pursued their own interests, only those who would bankrupt our country and dismember the Commonwealth in order to achieve their own goals, would put forward other suggestions."

    英造船业工人组织要求扩展国际间贸易
    英自由党领袖主张与一切国家进行贸易
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：据“工人日报”报道：克莱德班克工会理事会主席、英国最大的造船厂“约翰·布朗”的车间代表在格拉斯哥说：“航运要取决于贸易，而如果对世界上一些最大国家实行禁运的话，贸易是不可能扩大的。与俄国和中国进行全面的贸易将需要船只。禁止贸易的措施不可避免地会造成造船业的不景气。”
    克莱德的布莱斯沃德造船厂车间代表芬莱·哈特说：“即将到来的造船业的不景气有一个补救办法，关键就在于有一个太平的世界和扩大的贸易。”
    哈特举出了许多数字，说明英国造船业的订货是怎样在减少中。在一九五二年上半年，克莱德造船厂共接到制造五十七艘船的订货，这些船的总吨数将近五十万吨。在一九五三年同一时期，只接到制造十艘船的订货，总吨数仅有五万吨。
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社伦敦五日讯：据报纸报道：英国自由党领袖克莱门特·戴维斯在索墨塞特郡约维尔发表演说时说：英国应当与所有的国家自由进行贸易。戴维斯说，英国唯一的出路是不受限制地进行多方面的贸易，“换句话说，即与一切国家进行贸易，而且必须是自由贸易。只有那些从来就不尊重英国的利益而一味追求自己的利益的人，只有为了实现自己的目的不惜使我们国家破产、使英联邦四分五裂的人，才会提出其他的建议。”
