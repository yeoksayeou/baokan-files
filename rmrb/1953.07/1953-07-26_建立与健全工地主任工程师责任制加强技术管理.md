Establish and Improve the Chief Engineer Responsibility System on Construction Sites to Strengthen Technical Management
Li Ganzhong, Deputy Manager of the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau, Central Ministry of Heavy Industry

I.

In the past, the construction site management of the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau (formerly the Fifth Engineering Office of the Northeast Industrial Department Engineering Company) adopted a method of combining technology and administration. That is, engineers served as construction site directors, performing both administrative work and technical leadership. At that time, this approach was very suitable because the construction tasks were simple, the construction site was only responsible for direct construction, and there were fewer external contacts. With the development of national construction, the scale of construction sites has rapidly expanded. The construction site director must represent Party B (the engineering company) to be fully responsible for completing the construction site plan, fulfilling the responsibilities within the contract to Party A, and supervising the work of subcontractors. At the same time, in order to meet work needs, the construction site must implement cost accounting, establish various functional organizations, and strengthen political and organizational work on the construction site. As a result, the tasks of the construction site have become increasingly heavy. Since last year, although construction site directors in charge of administrative affairs have been added, the scope of responsibilities is still unclear. Many engineers feel "overwhelmed" and hope to reduce administrative affairs to concentrate on technical work. One engineer who was also a construction site director attended meetings with Party A and Party B and administrative meetings of the company for seven out of ten days. Some engineers had to affix their seals dozens of times a day, and they had to personally approve even requests for a few pencils or a broom. Some engineers, fearing entanglement in affairs, sometimes locked themselves in their dormitories or did technical work late at night. This has left the technical management of the construction site in a state of no one being responsible.

There was also no clear division of labor among the engineers on the construction site. If there were several engineers on a construction site, they each did their own thing. Often, due to differing opinions on certain issues, they argued endlessly, and no one made a final decision, so the construction workers did not know who to listen to. In one project, there were also several construction technicians who were only divided by work content, such as a carpentry technician, a concrete technician, and a rebar technician, each doing their own thing with no one taking overall responsibility. Last year, Technician A of the Fourth Construction Site asked workers to leave two radiator spaces when building a wall, but Technician B said not to leave any, and Technician C said to leave three, making it impossible for the workers to proceed.

II.

In this establishment of the technical responsibility system, we clarified the above situation and held forums with engineers, technicians, and administrative leaders to analyze and study the shortcomings of the "one-size-fits-all" approach, and identify the main reasons for the confusion in technical management, which was the entanglement of administrative and technical work and the lack of a chief engineer responsibility system on the construction site. Therefore, it was decided to change the past situation and stipulate that the chief engineer concurrently serve as the deputy director of the construction site, responsible for technical construction matters, and directly lead the relevant functional organizations of the construction site, such as the construction team and the planning team. If there are several engineers on a construction site, the one with superior conditions in all aspects (political, technical, organizational ability) should be selected as the chief engineer. In specific work, several people should divide the work, and other engineers should be responsible to the chief engineer and obey the chief engineer's handling and decision on technical issues. If there are different opinions, they can be raised for research. The administrative affairs of the construction site are the responsibility of the construction site director. These construction site directors, mostly due to a lack of technical knowledge and experience, may encounter some difficulties in their work, but everyone believes that as long as they overcome their dependence and actively learn and delve into it, they will gradually improve their management level.

III.

After several studies and mass discussions, we determined the following responsibilities for the chief engineer of the construction site:

	1.	Personally lead the compilation of the construction organization design and review the construction operation plan;
	2.	Organize construction technicians to study drawings, and be responsible for reviewing the specifications and quality of various construction details. When design changes or drawings do not match the actual situation, be responsible for making decisions;
	3.	Before the start of construction of each sub-project, organize engineering technicians to study quality standards and operating procedures, and be responsible for drafting quality standards for special projects (such as chimneys, etc.) and reconstruction projects. And be responsible for explaining to workers;
	4.	Be responsible for supervising the implementation and implementation of technical regulations and various management systems (such as raw material testing system, hidden project acceptance system, measurement benchmark inspection system, handover inspection system, etc.);
	5.	Be responsible for compiling construction measures plans and implementation methods, and supervise their implementation;
	6.	Preside over regular technical research meetings and technical professional meetings to improve the technical level of technical personnel and ensure project quality;
	7.	Preside over construction scheduling; be responsible for making timely decisions and taking effective measures when temporary technical problems occur during construction (material changes, shutdowns, rework, construction method changes, etc.);
	8.	The technical decisions and instructions made by the chief engineer must be strictly implemented by lower-level technical personnel; if there are different opinions, they can be reported to the administrative head, but before the new instructions are issued, the original instructions must still be followed;
	9.	The chief engineer has the right to participate in the construction site technical and administrative meetings; the construction site director should consult the chief engineer in advance regarding the rewards, punishments, transfers, promotions, and demotions of relevant technical cadres;
	10. Be responsible for making periodic technical work reports and technical special reports.

IV.

From the establishment of the chief engineer system on construction sites, we have initially realized that:

	1.	Establishing a chief engineer system is an effective way to overcome confusion in construction technical management and improve the professional level of technical personnel. In establishing this system, attention must be paid to unifying the thinking of leading cadres, dispelling various concerns through forums, using the chaotic facts of the past few years, and the state's expectations for each technical person. On the other hand, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to discuss, not only to provide opinions for the establishment of the system, but also to make the masses understand the importance of establishing the chief engineer system, and to lay the foundation for the implementation of the system. While establishing this system, we sent capable cadres to serve as construction site directors, taking charge of the overall work of the construction site, so that the chief engineer could concentrate on technical management work.
	2.	The establishment of the chief engineer system is to concentrate technical leadership, so one chief engineer should be set up in the same unit to avoid multiple leadership. If there are three assistant engineers on a construction site, we will adopt the method of "selecting a general from the dwarfs" to set up a responsible engineer. Under the chief engineer, a dedicated construction worker must also be set up among the several construction workers of each unit project, so that there is a dedicated person responsible at each level, and technical problems in construction can be solved in a timely manner.
	3.	The chief engineer system must be established under the principle of the construction site director responsibility system—that is, the one-chief system. The construction site director should be fully responsible for the entire work of the construction site, and all staff members of the construction site should cooperate under the leadership of the director. The chief engineer is a powerful assistant to the construction site director in technology, and his work must also be responsible to the director, and major technical measures must be signed and issued by the construction site director. When the director and the chief engineer disagree on relevant technical issues, the chief engineer can directly report to the company. Before the company makes a final decision, the director's opinion must be implemented. Of course, the construction site director should respect the engineer's opinions in order to give full play to his active role.

    建立与健全工地主任工程师责任制加强技术管理
    中央重工业部有色金属
    工业管理局第一工程公司副经理  李干忠
    一
    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司（原东北工业部工程公司第五工程处）的工地管理，过去是采用技术与行政合一的办法，即由工程师担任工地主任，既做行政工作又负责技术领导。在当时，施工任务单纯、工地只负责直接施工、对外联系也较少，这种作法是很适合的。随着国家建设的开展，工地规模迅速扩大，工地主任要代表乙方（工程公司）负责全面完成工地计划，对甲方实行合同内的职责，并监督分包单位的工作；同时为适应工作的需要，工地要实行成本核算，设立各种职能组织，要加强工地政治工作与组织工作。因之，工地任务日趋繁重。去年以来，虽然增设了管行政事务的工地主任，但职责范围仍分不清楚。许多工程师感到“吃不消”，希望减少行政事务，以集中精力进行技术工作。有一个工程师兼工地主任，在十天内就有七天参加甲乙方会议及公司行政会议。有的工程师每天要盖章数十次，不管需用几枝铅笔或一把扫帚也都要他亲自批准。有的工程师怕事务纠缠，有时把自己关在宿舍里或夜深人静的时候作技术工作。这样就使得工地技术管理处于无人负责的状态。
    工地里的工程师之间也没有明确的分工，如果一个工地有几个工程师，他们就各干各的，往往因某些问题意见不一致，争执不休，无人作最后决定，施工人员也不知听谁的好。一项工程中也有几个施工技术员，仅就工作内容分工，如木工施工员，混凝土施工员，钢筋工施工员，各搞一套，无人负全面责任。去年第四工地甲施工员要工人砌墙时留两个暖气包，乙施工员又说不留，丙施工员又说留三个，弄得工人无法进行工作。
    二
    我们在这次建立技术责任制中，摸清了上述情况，并召集工程师，技术员，行政领导干部举行座谈会，对“一揽子”的作法的缺点进行分析研究，找出技术管理混乱的主要原因，是行政工作与技术工作纠缠不清，工地没有建立主任工程师的责任制度。因此决定改变过去的情况，规定主任工程师兼工地副主任，负责技术上的施工事宜，工地有关职能机构如施工组，计划组由其直接领导。如果一个工地有几个工程师，应选拔各方面条件（政治、技术，组织能力）较优越者担任主任工程师，在具体工作上几个人分工，其他工程师要对主任工程师负责，服从主任工程师对技术问题的处理与决定，有不同意见可提出研究。工地行政事务，由工地主任负责。这些工地主任，多半由于缺乏技术知识与经验，可能在工作中会产生一些困难，但大家认为只要克服依赖思想，积极学习，钻进去，就会逐步把管理水平提高的。
    三
    经过几次研究与群众讨论，我们确定工地主任工程师的职责有以下几点：
    1、亲自领导编制施工组织设计与审核施工作业计划；
    2、组织施工技术人员研究图纸，负责审核各种施工大样的规格和质量，当设计变更或图纸与实际情况不符时，负责作出决定；
    3、每一分部工程开始施工前，组织工程技术人员学习质量标准及操作规程，负责草拟特殊工程
    （如烟筒等）与改建工程的质量标准。并负责向工人进行讲解；
    4、负责督促技术规程与各种管理制度（如原材料试验制，隐蔽工程验收制，测量基桩检查制，交接检查制等）的执行与贯彻；
    5、负责编制施工措施计划及实施办法，督促执行；
    6、主持定期的技术研究会和技术专业会，以提高技术人员技术水平，确保工程质量；
    7、主持施工调度；施工中发生临时技术问题（材料变更、停工、返工、施工方法变更等），负责及时作出决定并采取有效措施；
    8、主任工程师所作有关技术上的决定和指示，下级技术人员必须严格执行；如有不同意见时可向行政首长报告，但在新指示未下达前，仍照原指示执行；
    9、主任工程师有权参加工地技术行政会议；有关技术干部之奖惩、调转、升降，工地主任事先最好能征求主任工程师意见；
    10、负责定期作出技术工作报告与技术专题报告。
     四
    从建立工地主任工程师制度中，我们初步体会到：
    1、建立主任工程师制是克服施工技术管理混乱与提高技术人员业务水平的有效办法。在建立这一制度时必须注意统一领导干部的思想，通过座谈会、用过去几年来的混乱事实，国家对每个技术人员的期望等，打消各种顾虑。另一方面还必须发动群众讨论，不但为建立制度提供意见，并且使群众了解建立主任工程师制度的重要，为贯彻制度打下基础。在建立这一制度的同时，我们派了能力较强的干部担任工地主任，负起工地的全面工作，使主任工程师专心于技术管理工作。
    2、主任工程师制的建立是为了集中技术领导，所以在同一单位设置主任工程师一名，避免多头领导。如一个工地有三个助理工程师时，我们就采取“矮子中拔将军”的办法设置责任工程师。主任工程师之下，各单位工程几个施工员中还必须设立专责施工员，以便层层有专人负责，及时解决施工中的技术问题。
    3、主任工程师制必须在工地主任责任制——即一长制的原则下建立起来。工地主任要对工地整个工作全面负责，工地一切工作人员都应在主任领导下分工合作。主任工程师在技术上就是工地主任的有力助手，他的工作也必须对主任负责，重大技术措施必须经工地主任签署发布。当主任与主任工程师在有关技术问题上意见分歧时，主任工程师可直接向公司反映，在公司未作最后决定前，须执行主任之意见。当然工地主任应当尊重工程师的意见，以发挥其积极作用。
