A Bouquet of Red Flowers Dedicated to Loved Ones
Wan Sheng

Loved ones! Please accept my offering! Don't think this bouquet is too small; it's our expression of gratitude.

One rainy morning, we came out of the tunnels. Next to a bomb crater, we saw a patch of flowers, green leaves covered with round water droplets, the flowers blooming in dazzling red. Regardless of wind and rain, no matter how fierce the artillery fire, the red flowers always grew proudly.
  The old ones withered,
    And new ones bloomed again, blooming more and more luxuriantly.

Hearing that loved ones from the motherland had arrived, we felt like children seeing their mother again. My comrade said:
  "We are monitoring the enemy,
    Go and pick that bouquet of flowers
      And offer it to our loved ones!"

Comrade! This is not an ordinary bouquet of flowers, it is a flower of unyielding spirit,
          A flower of victory, it grows under the fire of war, and we nourish it with our blood.

Please take this red flower
  Together with our burning hearts, to my mother, to the beloved people of our motherland.

When they see this red flower, they will feel like they are seeing their own son.
  The son grows up in battle,
    The red flowers bloom in the flames of war.

There will definitely be a day,
  --Please believe it, people of the motherland!

On the hills of Korea, such dazzling red flowers will bloom everywhere.

    一束红花献给亲人
    万生亲人们！请接受我的献礼！不要嫌这束花太少，这是我们感激的心意。一个雨后的清晨，我们从坑道里出来。在一个弹坑旁边，看到一片花丛，绿叶上沾满了圆圆的水珠，花朵开得耀眼的红。不论刮风下雨，不论炮火打得多凶，红花总是傲然地长着，
  旧的谢了，
    新的又开，越开越茂盛。听说祖国的亲人来了，我们像孩子又看到了母亲。我的战友说：
  “我们监视着敌人，
    你去折下那束花
      献给亲人们！”同志！这不是一束普通的花，这是不屈的花，
          胜利的花，它在炮火下生长，我们用鲜血哺育着它。请你把这朵红花
  连同我们火热的心，带给我的妈妈，带给亲爱的祖国人民。他们看到这朵红花，会像见到自己的儿子一样。
  儿子在战斗中长大，
    红花在战火中开放。一定有那么一天，
  ——请祖国人民相信吧！在朝鲜的山坡上，开遍了这样耀眼的红花。
