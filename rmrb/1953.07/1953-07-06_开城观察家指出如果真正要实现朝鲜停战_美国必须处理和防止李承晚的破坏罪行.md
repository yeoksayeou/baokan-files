Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 5th: (Special Correspondent Wu Min reports) Observers here are closely watching the Syngman Rhee gang's provocative actions to further sabotage the armistice. American news agencies have openly revealed Syngman Rhee's plans to disrupt the armistice. These plans include two main points: First, to further "release" the remaining 8,000 Korean prisoners of war to hinder the signing of the armistice agreement; second, if an armistice agreement is signed, to refuse to withdraw the puppet troops from the military demarcation line, thereby undermining the establishment of a demilitarized zone.

Observers here point out that if the U.S. government truly wants an armistice in Korea, it must take all measures to address and prevent the Syngman Rhee group's criminal behavior of sabotaging the prisoner of war agreement and obstructing the realization of the armistice. Syngman Rhee and his spokesmen have openly and rampantly announced their plans to sabotage the armistice. If the United States does not take strict steps and actions against Syngman Rhee's conspiracy, it will only indicate that the U.S. military command is continuing to condone and encourage Syngman Rhee's anti-peace criminal plans.

The result of Syngman Rhee's serious violation of the prisoner of war agreement with American connivance is now very clear. Preparations for signing the armistice agreement have been interrupted for seventeen days. The "released" prisoners of war have been forcibly incorporated into the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

Syngman Rhee is becoming increasingly arrogant. Not only has he openly opposed the armistice, but he is demanding that an armed invasion be launched ninety days after the political conference to tear up the armistice agreement. He is openly calling for the unification of Korea by force, which has already suffered a shameful defeat in the past three years.

Obviously, anyone who supports Syngman Rhee is the number one enemy of world public opinion. Any promise of military support such as a "mutual defense treaty" would encourage this enemy of peace to carry out his plan to continue the war.

### 开城观察家指出如果真正要实现朝鲜停战  美国必须处理和防止李承晚的破坏罪行

    开城观察家指出如果真正要实现朝鲜停战
    美国必须处理和防止李承晚的破坏罪行
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：此间正在密切注视李承晚匪帮进一步破坏停战的挑衅行动。美国的通讯社已公开透露了李承晚破坏停战的计划，这个计划包括两个要点：一、进一步“释放”留下来的八千名朝鲜战俘，以阻碍签订停战协定；二、如果签订了停战协定，便拒绝把伪军从军事分界线撤退下来，以破坏非军事区的成立。
    此间观察家们指出，如果美国政府真正要在朝鲜停战的话，那它便必须采取一切措施，以处理并防止李承晚集团破坏战俘协议和阻挠停战实现的罪恶行为。李承晚和他的发言人已公然猖狂地宣布了他们破坏停战的计划。如果美国再不针对着李承晚的阴谋采取严厉的步骤与行动的话，那只会表示：美军司令部还在继续纵容和鼓励李承晚反和平的罪恶计划。
    李承晚在美国纵容下严重地破坏战俘协定的结果，现在已经十分明显。签订停战协定的准备工作已经被打断了十七天了。“被释放”的战俘们已经被强迫编入李承晚伪军。
    李承晚是愈来愈蛮横了。他不但已经公开地反对停战，他正在要求在举行政治会议之后九十天就发动武装侵略来撕毁停战协定。他正在公开地要求用武力统一朝鲜，而这在过去三年中是已经遭到了可耻的失败的。
    很明显，任何支持李承晚的人都是世界公众的第一号敌人。任何关于“共同防御条约”之类军事支持的诺言，都会鼓励这个和平的敌人去执行继续战争的计划。
