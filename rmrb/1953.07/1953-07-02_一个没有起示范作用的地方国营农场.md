    A State-Owned Farm That Failed to Set an Example
    Xiǎojiǎo
    The Jintang County Farm in Sichuan Province was established in 1951. It has 69 employees and cultivates 787 mu of land. For two years, it has not only failed to play its due demonstrative role but has also lost more than 110.14 million yuan. The nearby farmers say when they talk about it:
    "If we learn from the farm, we'll starve!"
    The leading cadres of the Jintang County Farm have an unclear understanding of the current purpose of the state running farms. They pay no attention to demonstrating increased production and breeding improved varieties to farmers, but regard the farm as a purely profit-making place. In 1951, there was a more than five-mu hillside field four li away from the farm, which was originally suitable as a demonstration field for food crops, but they thought it was too far away and rented it out. Flue-cured tobacco was not originally a local crop; just because its price was high, they disregarded whether there were technical conditions, and even more disregarded the demonstration significance to farmers, and planted more than six and a half mu of land that should have been planted with grain with flue-cured tobacco. Hearing that the price of sugar was high, they specially bought back 8,000 jin of sugarcane seeds from more than 500 li away to plant. The freight alone cost more than 2.1 million yuan. In September, in order to make a profit, they bought a flatbed truck for more than 4 million yuan, equipped it with livestock from the farm, and specialized in transporting goods for merchants on the highway to make money. As a result, they not only lost money, but also gave the farmers the wrong impression: the state runs farms just to make money. Some farmers asked the farm workers when they saw them: "How much have you earned again?"
    All the employees of the farm lacked production experience and agricultural science and technology, but the leading cadres of the farm concentrated their main energy on calculating profits and did not pay attention to leading everyone to seriously study and improve farming techniques.
    Last spring, when the workers had already gone to the fields to plant cotton, the cadres took the newspaper to the edge of the field and read to everyone "how to plant cotton." Many technical measures of the farm lagged behind the farmers. For example, the rice in the Wu Jifa mutual aid team in Xiu Shui Township had already been densely planted to more than 7,000 holes per mu last year, while the farm only planted more than 6,000 holes; the cotton in the Yang Daicai mutual aid team in Samsung Township had already been densely planted to more than 1,800 plants last year, while the farm only planted more than 1,000 plants; farmers had already generally carried out intertillage and weeding in the cotton fields, but weeds grew so tall in five-tenths of the farm's cotton fields that the cotton plants could not be seen; the drought prevention and pest control campaign had already been launched among the farmers, but the farm just started. When sowing winter wheat last year, the people's government called for the selection of improved varieties, but the farm used various mixed varieties, and the wheat plants grew unevenly. In terms of yield, many crops on the farm were also far inferior to those of local farmers. Last year, the Wu Jifa mutual aid team harvested an average of 712.8 jin of rice per mu, while the farm only harvested 542 jin; the Yang Daicai mutual aid team harvested an average of 67.5 jin of seed cotton per mu, while the farm only harvested 42.7 jin; Zhang Shengyu, a labor model in Longwei Township, harvested 200 jin of fruit from each fruit tree, while the farm only harvested 40 jin from each tree. The 31.9 mu of winter wheat planted by the farm last year had a relatively high yield, averaging more than 410 jin of wheat per mu. However, because of the blind pursuit of increased production and disregard for costs, the cost of fertilizer, labor, and cattle labor for each mu of land totaled 398,400 yuan, while the wheat harvested was only worth 287,000 yuan. In this way, although production increased, it still lost more than 3.5 million yuan.
    Because this farm cannot play a demonstrative role in production, it has lost its prestige among the farmers. When planting cotton this year, the leading cadres of Longwei Township mobilized the farmers of the entire township to go to the farm to "observe," but after waiting for most of the day, only seven or eight people came. The farmers reflected: What's there to see! We have already seen the farm's production for real.
    The leading cadres of this farm are also very poor at political education for the employees. The employees of the farm neither understand the nature and tasks of the local state-owned farm, nor do they understand that they are the masters of the farm. Many people have the idea of "doing the work perfunctorily." Last spring, when harvesting broad beans, it was the rainy season at that time. The workers were lazy and "dragging their feet" in the fields. When they heard that it was time to eat, they left, causing more than 5,800 jin of broad beans in 30 mu of land to be rained on. After harvesting and putting them into the warehouse, no one turned them over to dry, and as a result, 80% of them went moldy. When setting the winter wheat production increase plan last year, the farm director did not conduct investigations and research, nor did he discuss it with the workers. He proposed applying about 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. The workers had practical experience and knew that the soil quality in the farm was relatively fertile, and repeatedly suggested "there is no need for that much fertilizer," but the farm director never accepted this opinion. As a result, the wheat suffered lodging due to excessive fertilization, which caused losses and created a bad influence among the farmers.

    一个没有起示范作用的地方国营农场
    晓角
    四川省金堂县农场，是在一九五一年建立的。全场六十九个职工，经营着七百八十七亩田地。二年来，它不但没有起应有的示范作用，而且亏本一亿一千零十四万多元。附近的农民一谈起它来就说：
    “我们跟农场学习就要饿饭啦！”
    金堂县农场的领导干部，对于当前国家举办农场的目的是认识不清的。他们根本不注意对农民进行增产示范和繁殖优良品种，而把农场当做单纯营利的场所。一九五一年，在离该场四里路远有一块五亩多的山田，本来宜于作为粮食作物的示范田，但他们嫌路远，把它出租了。烤烟本来不是当地生长的作物；只是因为它的价钱高，他们就不顾有没有技术条件，更不顾对农民有没有示范意义，就将场内应该播种粮食的六亩五分多田，栽上了烤烟。他们听说糖的价钱高，就又特地从五百里以外的地方去买回了八千斤甘蔗种来种植。单这一趟运费就用去了二百一十多万元。到了九月份，他们为了赢利，又以四百多万元买了一部板车，配上场内的牲畜，专门到公路上去替客商运货赚钱。结果，不但亏了本，而且使农民发生了一个错觉：国家办农场就只是为了赚钱。有些农民看到农场的职工就问：“你们又赚多少了？”
    全场职工是缺乏生产经验和农业科学技术的，但农场的领导干部却把主要的精力集中在盘算营利上面，并不注意带领大家认真地进行学习和改进耕作技术。
    去年春天，工人已经到田里播种棉花了，干部才拿着报纸到地边对大家念“棉花要怎样种”。农场的许多技术措施都落在农民的后面。比如绣水乡邬纪发互助组的水稻，去年每亩已经密植到七千多穴，而农场的只植到六千多穴；三星乡杨代才互助组的棉花，去年已经密植到一千八百多株，农场的才植到一千株；农民们已经普遍的在棉田里进行中耕锄草了，农场有五分棉花地草长得看不见棉棵；防旱治虫运动已在农民群众中展开了，农场才动手。去年播种冬小麦时，人民政府号召选用优良品种，农场却用了各种混杂的品种，长起来以后麦棵参差不齐。在产量方面，农场有很多作物也远远比不上当地农民的。去年邬纪发互助组水稻每亩平均收到七百十二斤八两，农场的才收到五百四十二斤；杨代才互助组的棉花每亩平均收籽棉六十七斤五两，农场的才收到四十二斤七两；龙威乡劳动模范张生玉的果树每株收到二百斤，农场的每株才收到四十斤。全场去年种的三十一亩九分冬小麦，产量算是较高的，平均每亩收麦四百一十多斤。可是，因为盲目的追求增产，不计成本，每亩田的肥料、人工、牛工等成本费共花了三十九万八千四百多元，而收下的麦子只值二十八万七千元。这样，虽然增产了，还亏本三百五十多万元。
    这个农场因为在生产中不能起示范作用，也就丧失了它在农民群众中的威信。今年植棉时，龙威乡领导干部发动全乡农民到农场去“观摩”，等了大半天，只到了七、八个人。农民们反映：有什么看头！农场的生产，我们早就看实在了。
    这个农场的领导干部，对职工的政治教育也是很差的，全场职工既不了解地方国营农场的性质、任务，更不了解自己是农场的主人。许多人有“做一天和尚撞一天钟”的思想。去年春天收割葫豆时，当时是多雨季节，工人懒洋洋地在田里“磨洋工”，听说吃饭就走了，使三十亩田的五千八百多斤葫豆遭到了雨淋，收割入仓后，又没有人把它翻晒，结果就有百分之八十霉坏了。去年订冬小麦增产计划时，场长不作调查研究，也不和工人讨论，就提出每亩施基肥一万斤左右，工人们有实际经验，知道场里的土质比较肥沃，一再提出“用不着那样多肥料”，而场长始终没有接受这一意见。结果，小麦因为施肥过多，发生倒伏现象，受到了损失，在农民中也造成了不良的影响。
