Several Experiences in Mobilizing Women to Participate in Universal Suffrage

In the pilot work of grassroots universal suffrage in various regions, the universal suffrage movement was able to proceed smoothly, the proportion of voters participating in the voting reached a very high level, and the elected representatives also had broad representation because women were fully mobilized to participate in the universal suffrage activities. In Baoping Village, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, more than 91 percent of female voters participated in the election, ensuring that more than 93 percent of the voters participated in the election. In Changshan Village, Huaide County, Jilin Province, 94 percent of female voters were mobilized to participate in the election, and four women were elected as people's representatives. Many activists among women in the streets of the Second District of Jinan helped the work team to publicize to the masses how to register the population and register voters at the registration station. In the review of voter qualifications, a housewife named Gao Gongyi even reported the landlord class element Zhang Shuzhen. In some areas, women also represented the whole family to register the population at the registration station during the population survey, saving men's production time.

According to the current situation in various regions, to mobilize women to participate in universal suffrage activities, attention must be paid to the following issues in the work.

I. The leaders themselves must clearly recognize the importance of mobilizing women in universal suffrage, criticize erroneous ideas, and properly arrange this work. The grassroots universal suffrage pilot work team in Huaide County, Jilin Province, in addition to having unified steps and plans for the entire work, formulated a special plan on how to mobilize women to participate in universal suffrage, and designated specific personnel to be responsible for supervision. Whenever the work came to an end and a work summary was made, attention was paid to explaining the situation of women, summarizing the experience of mobilizing women, and putting forward the next requirements and steps. Leading cadres paid attention to mobilizing women in universal suffrage, and paid attention to criticizing the idea of not paying attention to mobilizing women. The cadres who participated in the universal suffrage training class in Yongfu County, Guangxi Province, initially had a very poor understanding of the importance of mobilizing women, believing that "women are useless." Some even raised objections, saying: "Now women have improved to the point of surpassing men, it will be even worse if we mobilize them again!" Zhao Jingyuan, the deputy county head of the county, made two reports in response to these ideas of the cadres, reversing these erroneous understandings. Some cadres of the universal suffrage work team in Junyang Town, Gaoan County, Jiangxi Province, believed that mobilizing women was the job of the Women's Federation, or felt that mobilizing women was troublesome, and relaxed this work. After the leadership discovered this situation and criticized it, the work team began to mobilize women. The experiences of these places prove that whether or not women can be mobilized in universal suffrage depends on whether the cadres of the election committees and election work teams at all levels attach importance to the work of mobilizing women. However, at present, some local election committees have not paid enough attention to and specifically arranged the work of mobilizing women, or although they have arranged it, they have not summarized and checked it, so the results are not great, forming a laissez-faire situation.

II. To mobilize women to participate in universal suffrage activities in the same way as men, it is necessary to conduct education on equality between men and women to the broad masses of men and women. Especially for women, it is necessary to carry out repeated publicity and education based on their ideological situation and starting from the vital interests of women, guiding them to understand the importance of universal suffrage and actively participate in universal suffrage activities. In the pilot work of universal suffrage in the Second District of Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, it was found that women were not concerned enough about universal suffrage, and even had a sense of inferiority. The work team started from the things that women were most concerned about to enlighten their awareness. For example, the work team learned that a local woman had given birth to seven children, all of whom died of "si liu feng" (postpartum illness), and then talked about the situation that the people's government trained midwives and promoted new midwifery methods. These facts related to the vital interests of women aroused their attention to universal suffrage and made them understand that only by electing good people can they do more good things for everyone. At the same time, the work team also used the model deeds of local women participating in work to illustrate that women have sufficient working ability, stimulate women's confidence in participating in elections, and overcome their sense of inferiority. Conducting education on equality between men and women among men is mainly to use the method of "calculating accounts" to illustrate the major contributions of women to society and correct their erroneous understanding that "old women are useless." The work team of the universal suffrage pilot village in Huaide County, Jilin Province, launched a discussion among the masses on the topic of the role of women in production. In the discussion, everyone talked about women being able to protect seedlings, thin seedlings, and weed seedlings in the promotion of the Zhaoyuan County bumper harvest experience. In addition to doing these things, women also take care of babies, cook, and manage household affairs. Therefore, the masses believe that if women do not do these things, men cannot produce well. As a result of the discussion, the masses automatically negated the erroneous conclusion that "old women are useless." After such a discussion, the masses automatically nominated women with good labor and style as candidates for representatives. The four female representatives elected in Changshan Village were all passed by unanimous vote.

III. To mobilize women to participate in universal suffrage activities, it is also necessary to solve their practical difficulties. Women have many more concerns when participating in social activities than men: children are entangled, and household chores are cumbersome. In rural areas, women also participate in field labor and raise livestock. They are often unwilling to attend meetings because they are worried about not feeding a pig well or not catching a chicken in a cage. These characteristics and difficulties of women must be given enthusiastic care and proper solutions, otherwise it will affect the smooth development of election work. In the Lianglukou electoral district of Shuanglong Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, nearly 40 women did not participate in the election because of feeding pigs and other chores because these difficulties and characteristics of women were not well considered in advance. On the contrary, in the pilot work of universal suffrage in Gongnong Township, Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, and Ping'an Village, Huaide County, Jilin Province, these difficulties of women were well arranged in advance, ensuring that more than 80% to 90% of female voters participated in the election. The universal suffrage pilot village work team in Ping'an Village, Huaide County, Jilin Province, in order to solve the difficulties of women, first understood the difficulties of women through activists. On the election day, they greeted women early to put the chickens in the cage and feed the pigs. At the same time, they mobilized young people under the age of 18 to help women with difficulties take care of children and look after gardens. For sick women or women in confinement, special personnel were sent to solicit their opinions on candidates. Elderly women were helped to the venue by young women, and some stools were set up in the venue for mothers and the elderly to sit. Women were very satisfied with this thoughtful care.

Finally, in the work of universal suffrage, special attention must be paid to educating and improving women's enthusiasm for labor, and solving the difficulties for women to participate in production under possible conditions, so that women can further strive to realize equal status with men in economic life and improve their enthusiasm for participating in universal suffrage. The Shengli Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baicheng, Heilongjiang Province, increased women's wages in the process of universal suffrage and eliminated the unreasonable phenomenon of women's wages being lower than men's wages. The universal suffrage work team in Huaide County, Jilin Province, helped women learn new farming techniques in the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience in universal suffrage. These measures also played a certain role in mobilizing women to actively participate in universal suffrage.

    发动妇女参加普选的几点经验
    在各地基层普选试办工作中，许多地区由于充分发动妇女参加了普选活动，使普选运动得以顺利开展，参加投票的选民达到很高的比例，选出的代表也具有广泛的代表性。四川省资中县保平村百分之九十一以上的女选民参加了选举，保证了参加选举的选民达到百分之九十三以上的比例；吉林省怀德县长山村发动了百分之九十四的女选民参加了选举，并有四名妇女被选为人民代表。济南第二区街道妇女中的许多积极分子，曾帮助工作组向群众进行宣传，告诉群众如何到登记站登记人口和进行选民登记；在审查选民资格中，家庭妇女高恭义更检举了地主阶级分子张淑贞。有些地区在人口调查时，妇女还代表全家到登记站登记人口，节省了男人的生产时间。
    根据目前各地的情况来看，发动妇女参加普选活动，必须在工作中注意如下几个问题。
    一、领导本身必须明确认识在普选中发动妇女的重要性，批判错误思想，并妥善地安排这一工作。吉林省怀德县的基层普选试点工作组，除去对整个工作有统一的步骤和计划外，对如何发动妇女参加普选制定了专门计划，并指定专人负责督促。每当工作告一段落进行工作总结时，注意交代妇女方面的情况，总结发动妇女的经验，提出下一步的要求和步骤。领导干部注意在普选中发动妇女，注意对于不重视发动妇女的思想进行批判。广西省永福县参加普选训练班的干部，最初对发动妇女的重要性认识很差，认为“妇女不顶事”，有人甚至提出反对意见说：“现在妇女已提高得超过男人啦，再发动更不得了啦！”该县副县长赵京元针对干部这些思想，作了两次报告，扭转了这些错误认识。江西省高安县筠阳镇普选工作组的干部，有人认为发动妇女是妇联的事情，或觉得发动妇女麻烦，而放松了这一工作。领导上发现这种情况并进行了批判之后，工作组才着手发动妇女。这些地方的经验证明，在普选中能否发动妇女，各级选举委员会和选举工作组的干部是否重视发动妇女的工作乃是先决条件。但目前有些地方的选举委员会还没有足够地重视和具体安排发动妇女的工作，或者虽已布置但没总结检查，因而成绩不大，形成放任自流。
    二、要发动妇女和男子同样地参加普选活动，必须对广大男女群众进行男女平等的教育。特别对妇女群众，要针对她们的思想情况，从妇女切身利益出发，进行反复的宣传教育，引导她们认识普选的重要性，积极投入普选活动。陕西省临潼县第二区普选试办工作中，发现妇女对普选不够关心，甚至有自卑心理，工作组就从妇女最关心的事情谈起，启发她们的觉悟。譬如工作组了解到当地一个妇女生了七个孩子，全死于“四六风”，就针对这件事情，谈些人民政府训练接生员，提倡新接生法的情况。这些关系妇女切身利益的事实，引起了她们对普选的重视，懂得了只有选出好人，才能给大家办更多的好事。同时，工作组还以当地参加工作的妇女的模范事迹，说明妇女有足够的工作能力，激发妇女参加选举的信心，克服自卑心理。在男子中进行男女平等的教育，主要是用“算账”的办法，说明妇女对社会的重大贡献，纠正他们认为“老娘们不顶事”的错误认识。吉林省怀德县普选试点村工作组，曾以妇女在生产中的作用为题发动群众展开讨论。在讨论中，大家谈到推广肇源县丰产经验中，妇女们能保苗、间苗、薅苗；妇女们除去干这些活外，还带娃娃，做饭，管家事。因此，群众认为：假若没有妇女做这些事情，男人也不能好好生产。讨论结果，群众自动地否定了“老娘们不顶事”的错误结论。经过这样讨论之后，群众自动提出劳动好，作风好的妇女为代表候选人。长山村选出的四个女代表都是全票通过。
    三、发动妇女参加普选活动，还必须解决她们的实际困难。妇女参加社会活动比男人多许多牵挂：有孩子纠缠，家事累赘；在农村里，妇女还参加田间劳动和饲养家畜，往往因为一只猪没有喂饱、一只鸡没有赶上笼，丢不下心事，而不愿意参加会议。对妇女的这些特点和困难，必须予以热情的关怀和妥善的解决，否则将会影响选举工作的顺利开展。四川省江津县双龙乡两路口选区，由于事先没有很好考虑妇女这些困难和特点，结果在选举时有近四十名妇女因为喂猪等杂事而没有参加选举。与此相反，四川省内江县工农乡、吉林省怀德县平安村等普选试点工作中，事先对妇女的这些困难做了很好的安排，而保证了百分之八十到百分之九十以上的女选民参加选举。吉林省怀德县平安村普选试点村工作组，为了解决妇女的困难，事先通过积极分子对妇女的困难做了一番了解，在选举日及早招呼妇女把鸡赶上笼，把猪喂饱，同时还动员未满十八岁的青年，帮助有困难的妇女带小孩、看园地；对生病的妇女或产妇，派专人前去征求她们对候选人的意见；年老的妇女则由年青的妇女搀扶到会场，会场中设置一些凳子，供母亲们和老年人坐。妇女们对这种体贴入微的关怀感到十分满意。
    最后，在普选工作中，必须特别注意教育和提高妇女的劳动积极性，在可能条件下解决妇女参加生产中的困难，使妇女们能在经济生活中进一步争取实现与男子平等的地位，提高她们参加普选的热情。黑龙江省白城胜利村农业生产合作社，在普选过程中提高了妇女的工资，消除了女工工资低于男工的不合理现象。吉林省怀德县普选工作组在普选中帮助妇女学会了肇源丰产经验中新式耕种技术。这些措施对于发动妇女积极参加普选也起了一定作用。
