    How to Identify Tungsten Ore

    Tungsten is a metal mineral that grows in quartz veins within igneous or metamorphic rocks. There are two main types: one is ferberite (including wolframite and ferberite); the other is scheelite (also known as heavy stone or calcium tungstate).

    Ferberite is similar to iron, but darker and shinier, with an appearance like several wooden boards stacked together, and edges like knife blades. Hence it is called platy or blade-like tungsten. Its hardness is 5.5, so it cannot be scratched with a knife. When you scratch it on a white porcelain plate, dark brown streaks appear. It is much heavier than a stone of the same volume.

    Scheelite is white or yellow in color, and its hardness is 4.5, so it can be scratched with a knife. It sometimes crystallizes into octahedrons, which are extremely delicate and beautiful. Sometimes it forms in grains or lumps, with a color and shape almost exactly like quartz; it cannot be distinguished with the naked eye, and can only be differentiated by illuminating it with a fluorescent lamp. If it is quartz, it will reflect a violet-blue color, while scheelite reflects a silver-white color. Scheelite often grows together with ferberite; where there is ferberite, there is often scheelite.

    Tungsten was discovered by humans later than other non-ferrous metals, but its uses are very extensive. Tungsten has high heat resistance and hardness, so it is suitable for making filaments in light bulbs. It can be refined into tungsten steel as an important material for the defense industry. In heavy industry, it can be used to manufacture high-speed steel for cutting tools and wear-resistant materials. In short, it has great uses in the steel industry, the electrical industry, and the defense industry.

    怎样识别钨矿
    钨是一种金属矿物，生长在火成岩或变质岩中的石英脉里。它的种类主要有两种：一种是黑钨（包括钨锰铁矿和钨铁）；一种是白钨（又叫重石或钨酸钙）。
    黑钨和铁差不多，但比铁更黑而发亮，外表好像几块木板叠起来一样，边沿像刀刃。所以称它为板状或刃状钨。它的硬度是五点五，用小刀刻不动它。拿它在白毛瓷板上一划，就出现了黑褐色的条痕。它比同样体积的石块重得多。
    白钨呈白色或黄色，它的硬度是四点五，用小刀可以刻伤它。它有时结晶成八面体，极其玲珑美观。有时结成粒状或块状，颜色和形状几乎完全和石英一样；用肉眼就无法辨识，只有用萤光灯照射来区别它。如果是石英，必然反射出紫蓝色，白钨则反射出银白色。白钨常常和黑钨生在一起，有黑钨的地方往往就有白钨。
    钨被人类发现的时间比其他有色金属较晚，可是它的用途却很大。钨具有很高的耐热性和硬度，因此它适宜于作电灯泡内的丝。它可以炼成钨钢作为国防工业的重要材料。在重工业上，它可以制造高切削钢，用作切削工具及耐磨材料。总之，它在钢铁工业上、电气工业上和国防工业上都有极大的用途。
