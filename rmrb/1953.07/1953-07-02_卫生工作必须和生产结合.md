Today, this newspaper reprints an article from the Xi'an Mass Daily, written by Zhang Mingxuan and others from the Huaxian People's Hygiene Institute, about how they forced farmers to engage in a large-scale hygiene campaign, delaying production. This article specifically illustrates that there are cadres in the patriotic hygiene movement who do not integrate hygiene work with production work and subordinate it to production work. Instead, they mistakenly regard hygiene work as an overriding central task, issuing orders to the masses and turning a good thing into a bad one. This is something we should pay attention to and be wary of.

In rural areas, all work must revolve around agricultural production work, and hygiene work is no exception. It is entirely correct for hygiene workers to care about the health of the people, and neglecting hygiene work is wrong. However, it is necessary to understand and learn the correct working methods, start from practical needs and possibilities, and use methods of persuading, educating, and relying on the masses to promote patriotic hygiene work. However, in order to create a "hygiene model village," Zhang Mingxuan flattened the land of poor peasants where wheat was growing five or six inches high to use as a manure field. For the sake of "good looks," he forced farmers to travel thirty miles day and night to carry blue soil to whitewash walls during the busy farming season. During the spring famine, when farmers were experiencing economic difficulties, he ordered them to buy masks and build toilets with bricks. These practices clearly and rudely violated the interests of the masses. However, this series of measures by Zhang Mingxuan was actually approved by the county-level leadership and supported by the head of the Culture and Education Section.

The Huaxian incident is by no means the only example of rudely violating the interests of the masses in hygiene work. In Shanghai, some workers went to various places by train in March to dig pupae in order to complete their pupae-digging task. Some became ill and were hospitalized due to sleeping in the open and being rained on. The pupae they dug out were not allowed to be carried on the train and had to be packed and mailed back to Shanghai. Some counties even mobilized the masses to put masks on dogs. From this, it can be seen that some of our leading cadres and leading organs in hygiene work currently have quite serious subjective and bureaucratic work styles that are divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, characterized by coercion and commandism, and the pursuit of formalism.

Through the lessons of these facts, our hygiene leading organs and hygiene workers should fully recognize that only by following the mass line, constantly caring about the vital interests of the masses, and understanding the opinions and demands of the masses can we do a good job in hygiene work. This is the true meaning of "integrating hygiene work with the mass movement." Any "taken-for-granted" subjectivism and coercive commandism will bring serious losses to the cause of the Party. Therefore, we hope that hygiene leading organs at all levels will carefully examine the work of their departments, thoroughly improve their leadership styles, and set appropriate and feasible tasks for mass hygiene work, making it a truly regularized mass movement.

### 卫生工作必须和生产结合

    卫生工作必须和生产结合
    今天本报转载西安群众日报所载华县人民卫生院干部张明轩等强迫农民大搞卫生运动耽误生产一稿，具体说明爱国卫生运动中有这样的干部，他不是把卫生工作和生产工作结合起来，服从于生产工作，而是错误地把卫生工作看成压倒一切的中心，并在群众中发号施令，把好事办成坏事。这是值得我们注意和警惕的。
    在农村中，一切工作都必须围绕农业生产工作来进行，卫生工作也是如此。卫生工作者关心人民群众的健康，这是完全正确的，忽视卫生工作的意见是错误的。但是，必须懂得和学会正确的工作方法，从实际的必要和可能出发，用说服群众、教育群众，依靠群众的方法来推动爱国卫生工作。可是，张明轩为要创造“卫生模范村”，将贫农的长到五、六寸的麦子地平作粪场；为了“好看”，竟在农忙季节，逼着农民白天黑夜地跑三十里远的地方去挑蓝土刷墙；在农民经济困难的春荒时节，命令农民去买口罩；用砖砌茅坑。这些做法，显然粗暴地违反了群众的利益。然而，张明轩的这一系列的措施，竟是通过县级的领导，并得到文教科长的支持的。
    华县的事件决不是卫生工作中粗暴地违反群众利益的唯一例子。上海市有些工人在三月间为了完成挖蛹任务，坐着火车到各地去挖蛹，有的因露宿雨淋而得病住院；挖出来的蛹，火车上不准携带，还得打上包裹寄回上海。有的县竟发动群众给狗戴口罩。由此可见，目前我们某些卫生工作的领导干部和领导机关，在工作中确实存在着相当严重的脱离实际、脱离群众、强迫命令、追求形式的主观主义和官僚主义作风。
    我们的卫生领导机关和卫生工作者，通过这些事实的教训，应当充分地认识到：只有走群众路线，时刻关心群众的切身利益，了解群众的意见和要求，才能搞好卫生工作，这就是“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的真义。任何“想当然”的主观主义和强迫命令的作风，都将给党的事业带来严重的损失。因此，我们希望各级卫生领导机关，认真地检查本部门的工作，彻底改善领导作风，为群众卫生工作定出恰当可行的任务，使它成为真正经常化的群众运动。
