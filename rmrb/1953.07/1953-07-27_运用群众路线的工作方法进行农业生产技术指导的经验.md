The CPC Wendeng District Committee of Shandong Province

Found a Way to Strengthen Agricultural Production Technical Guidance

In leading agricultural production work over the past few years, the CPC Wendeng District Committee of Shandong Province has achieved certain successes in promoting improved varieties and advanced farming techniques, increasing the total agricultural output last year by 46.7% over the pre-war annual output. However, serious shortcomings and errors have also occurred in leading agricultural production work. For example, due to inappropriately advocating an "early planting" slogan, severe seed rotting and seedling shortages occurred. In Kunyu County, over 300,000 jin of peanut seeds rotted in 1950 due to being planted too early. The erroneous promotion of building urine pools and using bean flour to create "artificial urine" resulted in significant waste for farmers. Since 1951, a one-sided emphasis on "high-yield fields" and rewarding high-yield models led to serious deviations of disregarding costs, blindly increasing fertilizer use, and simply pursuing high yields, resulting in reduced yields in some "high-yield fields" due to irrational fertilization and reduced actual income for some farmers despite increased land yields. Especially in the spring of 1952, serious bureaucracy and commandism were displayed in organizing well digging for drought resistance and promoting waterwheels, walking plows, and chemical fertilizers. Of the over 30,000 wells dug in the district in 1952, only 10% were actually usable. Most wells became "watching wells," waterwheels became "sleeping wheels," and walking plows became "hanging plows." Some fertilizer powder damaged crops due to improper application. Party and government cadres did not understand agricultural production techniques, did not attach importance to the leadership of economic work, and were mired in general appeals. Financial and economic cadres lacked a clear concept of serving production, only managing simple loans and trading without considering the actual effect. Technical guidance cadres held purely technical viewpoints, only concerned with technology and not engaging in mass work. The above shortcomings and errors greatly hindered the development of agricultural production and affected the relationship between the Party and the masses.

Since the launch of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline this spring, leading cadres at all levels have urgently demanded a change in leadership style. However, many cadres believe: "Commandism is not right, but how can we do a good job without commanding?" Some cadres developed negative sentiments of "take it slow, do as much as you can." Some supply and marketing cooperative cadres simply adopted a negative attitude of "wait for customers to come, sell if they buy, forget it if they don't." In the anti-bureaucracy struggle, the Wendeng District Committee, through summarizing typical experiences, conducting comparative education between good and bad examples, and timely commending good people and good deeds, organized cadres for repeated study, followed by sending them in large numbers to the countryside to deeply understand that the farmers' urgent demand was to grow more grain, and that the key to increasing grain production was to further improve agricultural production techniques on the basis of organization. This enabled cadres to further recognize the importance of strengthening technical guidance for agricultural production and transforming the leadership style in the process of providing technical guidance. As a result, the enthusiasm of cadres greatly increased, and their confidence in their work greatly strengthened. They generally reflected: "In the past, we also emphasized improving agricultural production techniques, but because we didn't understand the techniques, we turned good things into bad things." Some cadres said: "All day long, we've been fighting against bureaucracy and commandism, but we couldn't find the door. This time, we've found the 'key.'"

Summarizing Production Experience, Learning Production Techniques

In order to summarize and transmit various production experiences in spring plowing and production, and strengthen technical guidance, the Commissioner's Office convened an agricultural technology conference before the spring plowing. Participants in this conference included Party and government cadres leading agricultural production at the county and district levels, representatives from various financial and economic departments and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural production technicians, and representatives from agricultural production cooperatives (labor models). At the meeting, on the one hand, the errors in past work were criticized through summarizing the work; on the other hand, successful experiences were affirmed, and the various production techniques for spring plowing and planting and striving for wheat harvests were summarized and introduced through methods of teaching and learning simultaneously, and on-site experiments. The dismantling and repair methods and usage techniques of new-style walking plows were specifically taught, and the performance and usage methods of various chemical fertilizers were introduced. The results of the meeting proved that it was very beneficial to convene the above four types of people to participate in the meeting. It can enable these working cadres and labor models with rich production experience to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses; not only summarize the production experience of the masses, but also find ways to promote technology by following the mass line, thereby effectively overcoming the general leadership style. As some government working cadres said in their review at the meeting: "Last year, when I saw someone plowing with a seven-inch walking plow, I tried to detour around it, fearing that people would ask technical questions." Financial and economic cadres also found ways to develop their business and connect with the masses. Zhang Yunlou, the head of the Joint Village Cooperative of the Eleventh District of Kunyu County, also reviewed that in the past, because he did not understand the technology, when farmers came to buy chemical fertilizers, he would talk nonsense, such as "Last year, when promoting fertilizer powder, farmers wanted to buy something for growing branches and leaves, I said this is for growing branches and leaves; later, someone wanted to buy something for growing seeds, I said this is for growing seeds." Technical personnel also understood that technical guidance is part of the political task, and technical guidance work must follow the mass line. For example, when the technical personnel explained the center of resistance of the double-share plow to the farmers, the farmers did not understand. Later, a farm worker gestured with his hand, and everyone understood, which made the technical personnel realize that "relying solely on books is not enough." The convening of this meeting also enabled the working cadres of various departments to find ways to serve the "overwhelming central task of agricultural production" in their actual work in rural areas. After this meeting, the participants received a profound education, and unanimously felt that this meeting truly solved the problem. After the Commissioner's Office meeting, most counties and districts also convened similar meetings. According to incomplete statistics from six counties, more than 28,000 people participated in these meetings; this organized a backbone force for spring plowing production and greatly promoted production work.

Bringing Technology to the Countryside, Providing Specific Guidance for Agricultural Production

After the technology conference, the District Committee organized county-level cadres to study agricultural production technology issues in spring plowing, and called on all work teams to simultaneously become production work teams, and all base points to simultaneously become production base points. Then, starting from the District Committee Secretary and District Committee members, leaders at all levels successively led large numbers of cadres into the countryside to guide spring plowing production. After the cadres learned the technology and went to the countryside, they adopted various methods to teach the masses. In this regard, the CPC Haiyang County Committee adopted the method of first summarizing the production experience of three villages and the experience of increasing production of nine crops such as wheat, corn, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and millet in spring, and then cadres going to the villages to teach in small meetings at night (farmers voluntarily participated), and going to the fields with farmers during the day for on-site guidance. The CPC Kunyu County Committee adopted methods such as convening discussion meetings and mutual aid team leader meetings, first summarizing the local people's experience, and combining it with introducing advanced experience from other places. At first, some cadres did not believe that this method could promote technology. Later, they saw that more people voluntarily participated than attended village meetings in the past, and the masses were very interested in learning advanced experience. The district cadres of the Thirteenth District of Rushan County convened a forum of old farmers. They originally planned to teach the advanced experience of corn planting from other places first, but in the forum, farmer Diao Jinji said: "One year, I planted corn on the mountain. I took yellow seeds. There were not enough seeds, so I went home and took some white ones to mix together. Later, many corn ears grew two-colored grains. All the cobs like that were big, and the grains were big. I don't know why?" After the cadres discovered this problem, they looked for people who understood the technology to study it, proving that this method was the same as the yellow-white hybrid yield increase experience that had been verified in Northeast China, and decided to promote it. As a result, two-thirds of the township adopted this planting method.

The method of cadres bringing technology to the countryside combines political work with technical guidance. On the one hand, it touched on the issue of how to specifically lead production, and began to overcome the shortcomings of the past of only making empty political appeals for the generalized leadership of production; on the other hand, it touched on the working methods and ways of the Party leading agricultural production. For a long time, we have forgotten the principle of voluntariness and the method of persuasive education in leading production. This is one of the important reasons for generating commandism. Therefore, opposing commandism can only be transformed from specific working methods to achieve practical results, so as not to turn the good things done for the masses into bad things, causing opposition from the masses.

Combining the Propaganda Network with the Technical Guidance Network

In carrying out specific agricultural production technology propaganda work, the Wendeng area firmly grasped the two organizations of the Party's propaganda network and the agricultural technology guidance network. In the past, the Party's propaganda network only paid attention to political propaganda, while the agricultural technology guidance network was limited to the research and propaganda of technology itself, so the effect of both propaganda was limited. From this spring, the Wendeng District Committee emphasized the issue of propagandists learning technology, combining the Party's political propaganda with the specific guidance of agricultural production technology, that is, combining political work with economic work, so as to better exert the role of the Party's propaganda network. In order to solve the difficulties existing in propagandists' propaganda of agricultural production technology, in addition to organizing cadres and technical personnel to teach them, the slogan "First be a student, then be a teacher" was also put forward, requiring them to learn well. According to several years of experience, the work of the agricultural technology guidance network is best carried out by administrative leaders, organizing a technology research and promotion committee (at present, the Wendeng area has this organization at the district level and above), with the technical guidance department (the district has set up a technical guidance institute, some counties have set up technical promotion stations, and general counties have experimental farms) as the center, closely linking with small farms established by advanced mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives (labor models Zhang Fugui, Song Hansheng, and Tang Shikai all have such small farms) and agricultural demonstration households among farmers (farmers who are entrusted by farms to carry out small-scale key experiments), as well as technicians in general mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives (more than 20,000 mutual aid groups in the entire district already have technicians). In this way, a regular technical guidance organization is gradually formed. This organization works in conjunction with the base points controlled by the Party committees at all levels, and is given key guidance by the Party committees. It not only plays a role in agricultural production, but is also a great force in carrying out political propaganda.

In addition, various exhibitions are organized to introduce production increase experiences; visits are organized to learn technology; agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid groups are mobilized to sign "technology contracts" with farms, guaranteeing that the masses will not suffer production losses after adopting new production technologies. This allows farmers to boldly adopt new production technologies.

Improving the Method of Promoting New Agricultural Implements

Promoting technology through supply and marketing and credit work, especially through supply and marketing work combined with the propaganda of agricultural production technology, is also an important way to promote technology. This not only solves the problem of how supply and marketing work can specifically serve production, but also helps the development of supply and marketing business. This spring, the leaders of the District Supply and Marketing Cooperative called on supply and marketing cooperative cadres to learn as many simple agricultural technologies as possible, such as the use and repair of new-style walking plows and waterwheels, the performance and use of chemical fertilizers, etc., and emphasized that they should teach the masses the usage technology as much as possible when promoting sales. This made the past "sleeping wheels" (waterwheels) and "hanging plows" (walking plows) useful things. This spring, 135 waterwheels and more than 1,800 walking plows were sold in the district, an increase of 254% compared to the same period last year. In order to better achieve the purpose of publicity, the supply and marketing cooperative cadres in the entire district launched a wave of learning technology. Cadres from the 22 supply and marketing cooperatives in the first district of Kunyu County all learned the use and repair methods of walking plows, understood the performance of fertilizer powder, and learned the use methods of fertilizer powder. Then, they went to various villages to promote the materials needed by farmers by teaching technology, and helped farmers repair the waterwheels and walking plows that were sold last year but not yet used. In this way, they were warmly welcomed by the farmers. One day, farmers from six villages came to invite salesman Wang Fenheng to teach technology. The salesmen at home also tried their best to promote the function and usage methods of each production material to the farmers when selling new agricultural implements. Therefore, farmers were willing to buy things. The farmers reflected: "When you buy things from the cooperative, you also bring the technology with you." During the spring plowing period, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Eleventh District of Haiyang County organized 15 cadres to go to various villages to make the walking plow play its role. They repaired 130 walking plows in four days and taught the farmers the repair technology. Many mutual aid groups automatically went to the cooperative to sign joint contracts. They said: "This year, the cooperative has changed its business methods. If we sign a contract with the cooperative, it will be more convenient in the future." The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative saw that the supply and marketing business was developing this spring. When summarizing the work, they said: "In the past, we only knew that serving the members requires in-depth participation in the production process, but we didn't know how to do it. This time, we have opened our minds." In this way, everyone learned to adopt business operation methods that meet the requirements of the farmers at that time and place, so that the supply and marketing business has developed greatly this spring.

This year, in leading spring plowing production, the Wendeng area has strived to implement the principle of "taking spring plowing production as the overwhelming center," striving to combine political work with economic work, political work with technical guidance, and economic work with technical guidance. In terms of working methods, the method of starting from reality and taking care of the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy was used to replace the method of subjectively stipulating tasks, the method of democratic consultation was used to replace coercive means, the method of persuading and educating the masses was used to replace simple administrative methods, and the method of enterprise management was used to replace the method of allocating tasks level by level through administrative organizations, thereby strengthening technical guidance for agricultural production, realizing the Party's specific leadership over agricultural production, and implementing the Party's mass line style. Therefore, the cadres are happy and the masses are satisfied. Many cadres reflected: "In the past, the work was strenuous and unrewarding, but this year it is easier to complete the task." "Understanding production knowledge and learning technology makes it easier to go in depth and find the key to the work." The farmers generally reflected: "In the past, production was really awkward, and the superiors did not come to our side. This year, production is really smooth." "The superiors have changed, and the cadres have also changed. This is how it looks like producing and living!"

    运用群众路线的工作方法进行农业生产技术指导的经验
    中共山东文登地委会
    找到了加强农业生产技术指导的方法
    中共山东文登地委几年来在领导农业生产工作上无论在推广良种、推广先进耕作技术方面，都获得了一定的成绩，使去年的农业年产量超过了战前年产量的百分之四十六点七。但是，在领导农业生产工作中，也曾发生了严重的缺点与错误。例如由于不适当地提出了早种的口号，曾发生过严重的烂种缺苗现象。昆嵛县即在一九五○年因种的过早而腐烂的花生种有三十余万斤。由于错误地提倡修建尿池，用豆面沤“人造尿”，造成农民很大的浪费。一九五一年以来，由于片面地强调搞“丰产田”，奖励丰产模范，因而发生了严重的不计成本、盲目增肥、单纯追求高额产量的偏向，致使有些作物的“丰产田”因施肥不合理而减产，有些农民的土地收获量虽然增加了，但实际收入反而减少。特别是一九五二年春季，在组织打井抗旱与推广水车、步犁、化学肥料等工作中表现了有严重的官僚主义与命令主义。一九五二年全区打井三万多眼，实用的只占百分之十。大部分水井成了“看井”，水车成了“睡车”，步犁变成了“挂犁”；有些肥田粉因施用不当而损毁了庄稼。党、政干部不懂农业生产技术，不重视经济工作的领导，而陷于一般化的号召；财经干部缺乏明确地为生产服务的观念，只管单纯贷款、作买卖，而不问实际效果；技术指导干部则存在单纯技术观点，只管技术，不作群众工作。上述缺点与错误大大障碍了农业生产的发展并影响了党与群众的关系。
    今春开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争以来，各级领导干部都迫切要求转变领导作风，但有不少干部认为：“命令主义不对，不命令怎样能作好工作呢？”有些干部产生了“慢慢来，作多少算多少”的消极情绪。有些供销合作社的干部则干脆采取“等客上门，有买就卖，不买拉倒”的消极态度。文登地委在反官僚主义斗争中通过总结典型经验，进行好坏实例的对比教育，及时表扬了好人好事，又组织干部进行了反复的学习，接着大批干部深入到乡村去，使他们深切地了解了农民的迫切要求是多打粮食，而增产粮食的关键是在组织起来的基础上进一步地改进农业生产技术，这就使干部进一步地认清了加强对农业生产技术指导、并在进行技术指导的过程中转变领导作风的重要意义。于是干部的积极性大大提高，工作信心大大增强。他们普遍反映：“过去也强调要改进农业生产技术，由于自己不懂技术，结果把好事办成坏事。”有的干部说：“整天价反官僚主义、反命令主义，老是摸不着门，这回可把‘钥匙’找着了。”
    总结生产经验，学习生产技术
    为了总结与传授春耕生产中的各项生产经验，加强技术指导，春耕前专署召开了农业技术会议。参加这个会议的有县、区领导农业生产的党政干部、各财经部门和基层供销合作社的代表、农业生产技术人员和农业生产合作社的代表（劳动模范）。会上，一面通过总结工作，批判了过去工作中的错误；一面肯定了成功的经验，并采取边教边学、现场实验的方法，总结介绍了春耕春种和争取小麦丰收的各项生产技术，具体传授了新式步犁的拆卸、修理办法和使用技术，介绍了各种化学肥料的性能和使用方法等。会议的结果证明了召集上述四种人参加会议是有很大好处的，可以使这些工作干部和富有生产经验的劳动模范，取长补短、互教互学；既总结了群众中的生产经验，又找到走群众路线推广技术的方法，从而有效地克服一般化的领导作风。正如有些政府工作干部在会上检查时所说的：“去年看到有七吋步犁耕地的就设法绕道过去，就怕人家问技术上的问题。”财经工作的干部也找着了开展业务的门路和联系群众的方法。昆嵛县十一区供销合作社联村社张云楼还检查了过去由于不懂技术，农民来买化学肥料时，就乱说一起，如“去年推销肥田粉，农民要买长枝叶的，我说这就是长枝叶的；后来有人要买长籽粒的，我又说这就是长籽粒的。”技术人员也懂得了技术指导是政治任务的一部分，技术指导工作必须走群众路线。例如：当技术人员向农民讲解双铧犁的抗力中心点时，农民听不懂，后来由农场工人用手一比划，大家都明白了，从而使技术人员认识到“光靠书本是不行的。”这次会议的召开，也使各个部门的工作干部找到了在农村实际工作中如何服从以“农业生产为压倒一切的中心任务”的门路。经过这次会议，使到会的人员都受到了一次深刻的教育，一致感到这个会议真正解决了问题。专区会议开过之后，多数县、区也召开了类似的会议，据六个县不完全的统计，参加这些会议的有两万八千多人；这就为春耕生产组织了一批骨干力量，大大地推动了生产工作。
    带技术下乡，具体指导农业生产
    开过技术会议之后，地委又组织了县级干部学习春耕中的农业生产技术问题，并号召各种工作队同时成为生产工作队，各种基点同时成为生产基点。然后从地委书记地委委员起，各级领导干部都先后带领大批干部深入农村，指导春耕生产。干部学会了技术下乡以后，采取了多种方式向群众传授。在这方面，中共海阳县委采取了先总结三个村的生产经验和春季小麦、玉米、花生、地瓜、谷子等九种作物的增产经验，然后由干部到村采取夜间开小会传授（农民自愿参加），白天和农民一道下地进行现场指导。中共昆嵛县委采取了召开座谈会、互助组长会等方法，先总结当地群众的经验，并联系介绍外地的先进经验。起初有些干部不相信这个方法可以推广技术，后来看到自愿参加的比过去召开村民大会来的人还多，群众对先进经验学习很有兴趣。乳山县十三区区干部召集了老农座谈会，本来打算先传授外地种植玉米的丰产经验，但在座谈中农民刁金吉说：“有一年我上山种玉米，拿的是黄色种，种子不够了，又回家拿了些白的合上去，后来不少玉米穗上都长了两色粒，凡是这样的棒也大，粒也大，不知什么原因？”干部发现了这一问题后就找懂得这方面技术的人员研究，证明这办法与东北已经证实了的黄白杂交增产的经验相同，便决定加以推广。结果全乡三分之二都采用了这样的种植法。
    干部带技术下乡的方法，使政治工作与技术指导结合起来，一方面摸到了如何具体领导生产的问题，开始克服过去只会作空洞的政治号召的一般化的领导生产的缺点；另一方面摸到了党领导农业生产的工作方式方法问题。长时间以来，我们在领导生产中忘记了自愿的原则与说服教育的方法，这是产生命令主义的重要原因之一。因此，反对命令主义只有从具体工作方法上加以转变，才会收到实效，才不致于把给群众办的好事变成坏事，引起群众的反对。
    把宣传网与技术指导网结合起来
    在具体进行农业生产技术的宣传工作中，文登地区是紧紧掌握了党的宣传网与农业技术指导网这两种组织。过去党的宣传网只注意了政治宣传，而农业技术指导网则又限于技术本身的研究与宣传，因而这两种宣传的效果都有很大的局限性。从今年春天起，文登地委就强调了宣传员要学习技术的问题，使党的政治宣传和农业生产技术的具体指导结合起来，也就是把政治工作与经济工作结合起来，从而更好地发挥党的宣传网的作用。为了解决宣传员在宣传农业生产技术上存在的困难，除组织干部和技术人员向他们传授外，同时又提出“先当学生，后当先生”的口号，要求他们很好地进行学习。而农业技术指导网的工作，根据几年来的经验，在进行农业技术指导上，最好是采取由行政领导负责主持，组织技术研究推广委员会（目前文登专区在区以上均有这一组织），以技术指导部门（专区设立了技术指导所，有的县设立了技术推广站，一般县都有实验农场）为中心，密切联系先进互助组和农业生产合作社所建立的小型农场（劳动模范张富贵、宋汉生、唐士凯均有这样的小型农场）和农民中的农业示范户（受农场委托进行小规模重点实验户），以及一般互助组、农业生产合作社中的技术员等进行工作（全专区已有两万多个互助组有了技术员）。这样，便逐渐形成一个经常性的技术指导组织。这种组织结合各级党委所掌握的基点进行工作，并由党委进行重点指导，它不仅在农业生产上发挥了作用，而且在进行政治宣传上也是一个很大的力量。
    此外就是组织各种展览会，介绍增产经验；组织参观，学习技术；发动农业生产合作社或互助组与农场订“技术合同”，保证群众采用了新的生产技术后不使生产量损失的合同。这样使农民敢于大胆采用新的生产技术。
    改进推广新农具的方法
    通过供销、信贷工作，特别是通过供销工作结合宣传农业生产技术，也是推广技术的一种重要方式。这样做不仅可以解决供销工作如何具体为生产服务的问题，而且有助于供销业务的开展。今年春天专区供销合作社的领导上号召供销社干部尽量学习几项简单的农业技术，如新式步犁和水车的使用和修理，化学肥料的性能和使用法等，并强调在推销中应尽可能把使用技术教给群众，这样使过去的
    “睡车”（水车）“挂犁”（步犁）成为了有用的东西，今年春季就在全区推销了水车一百三十五部，步犁一千八百多部，比去年同期增加了百分之二百五十四。为了更好地达到宣传目的，全区供销
    合作社干部掀起了学习技术的热潮，昆嵛县一区二
    十二个供销合作社的干部全部学会了步犁的使用法和修理法，懂得了肥田粉的性能和学会了肥田粉的使用法。然后，他们分头到各村通过传授技术，推销农民所需的物资，并帮助农民修理去年推销出去尚未使用的水车、步犁。这样他们受到了农民的热烈欢迎。有一天，就有六个村的农民来请营业员王凤珩去教技术。在家的营业员在卖新式农具时也尽可能向农民宣传每种生产资料的作用与使用方法。因而农民都愿来买东西。农民们反映：“在合作社买回来东西，把技术也带上了。”海阳县十一区供销合作社在春耕期间，为了发挥步犁的作用，曾组织了十五名干部分头到各村去，他们在四天内检修了一百三十部步犁，并使农民也学会了检修的技术。许多互助组都自动到合作社去订立结合合同。他们说：“今年合作社做买卖变了法子，再与合作社订上个合同，今后就更方便了。”供销合作社的干部看到今春的供销业务有了开展，在总结工作时都说：“过去只知道为社员服务，要深入生产过程，但不知道怎么个作法，这回可开了窍了。”这样也就使大家学着采用适合当时当地农民要求的企业经营的方法，从而使今春的供销业务有了很大的发展。
    文登地区今年在领导春耕生产中，努力贯彻着“以春耕生产为压倒一切的中心”的方针，努力使政治工作与经济工作结合起来，政治工作与技术指导结合起来，经济工作与技术指导结合起来。在工作方法上，努力以从实际出发照顾小农经济特点的方法代替了主观规定任务的方法，以民主商量的办法代替了强制的手段，以说服教育群众的方法代替了单纯的行政方式，以企业经营的方式代替了通过行政组织逐级摊派的方式，从而加强了农业生产的技术指导，实现着党对农业生产的具体领导，贯彻着党的群众路线的作风。因而干部高兴，群众满意。许多干部反映：“过去的工作是费力不讨好，今年却比较容易的完成了任务。”“懂得了生产知识，学会了技术，也容易深入了，工作摸到门道了。”农民们普遍反映：“过去生产真蹩扭，上级不和咱走到一道来，今年生产真顺劲。”“上级变了，干部也变了，这才像生产过日子的样！”
