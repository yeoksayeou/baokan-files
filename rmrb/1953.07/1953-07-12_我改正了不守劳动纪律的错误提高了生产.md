I Corrected My Violation of Labor Discipline and Increased Production
Wang Shuqin

I am Wang Shuqin, a shoe-gluing worker at the private Yuh Rubber Factory in Tianjin. Before liberation, my father and uncle were unemployed, and my mother worked as a servant. Our family lived hand to mouth, never knowing where the next meal would come from. In the year of Tianjin's liberation, my mother arranged a marriage for me, and I thought to myself, "This is great! I can rely on my husband and never have to worry about food and clothing again."

My husband's name is Guo Qingming, and he is a worker at the private Yuh Rubber Factory. Before we got married, he often urged me to work in the factory. I didn't like the idea at all. I thought, "There are so many relatives and friends in the factory. If I still work after getting married, it will be embarrassing for people to see! Besides, staying at home, I can just wash the dishes after eating, and that's it. It's so much more free. Going to the factory means having to go to work and get off work on time. It's not as good as being at home." Later, to help me, he repeatedly told me, "In the new society, labor is the most glorious thing. Women were oppressed and looked down upon in the old society due to feudalism. Now women are liberated, but only by actively participating in labor, being independent and self-reliant, and not relying on others economically can we truly achieve equality with men." I thought what he said made sense, but then I thought again, "It's still not as good as eating, drinking, and strolling around at home." Later, I couldn't resist him, so I went to Yuh Rubber Factory in 1950 to learn how to glue shoes with a "let's see how it goes" attitude. At that time, there were more than 100 workers in the factory, most of them young people. There were also about 20 workers in our shoe-gluing workshop, which seemed quite lively. I thought, "This is more fun than being at home." Back then, at work, I would chat and gossip with the female workers. Sometimes, when I got tired of sitting, I would go "visit" other workshops and joke around with the male workers. After work, I didn't rest properly, but wandered the streets and watched movies, staying out very late, so I was late the next day and dozed off during production. People could glue more than 30 pairs of shoes a day, but I only glued 20 pairs, and I often produced defective products, because I was having too much fun. Not long after the "Five-Anti Campaign," the factory promoted me to a permanent worker. I thought, "This is even better! Before, I was a temporary worker, always playing around, and always worried that people would fire me. Now that I'm a permanent worker, I can play around even more boldly and not be afraid of anything!"

My erroneous thinking gradually changed later with the education of the trade union and the help of my comrades. Several things influenced me deeply. My uncle had no job before liberation, and he suffered and starved with us all the time. He finally managed to become a porter after liberation, and the family no longer had to worry about life. Last year, while carrying goods, he accidentally injured his spine. If this had happened in the past, it would have been all over, but today, in our country, workers enjoy labor insurance benefits. With the help and care of the People's Government and the trade union, my uncle's injury was treated free of charge for a year, and he recovered. Soon after, my younger brother contracted an infectious disease and became very ill, almost dying. The family had no money and could not afford to go to the hospital, and we were so anxious that we didn't know what to do. The police station found out and issued a free medical certificate. Later, my brother's illness was also cured in the hospital. Who could have imagined such things in the old society? Whenever I thought of these things, I was moved from the bottom of my heart, and I thanked the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Because of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have what we have today. Today, we workers are truly the masters of the country! Looking at the great achievements of our country's construction in recent years, even our factory has a nursery (established by the trade union for us workers). The large-scale construction of our country's Five-Year Plan has also begun, and our lives will definitely be better and happier in the future. The future of our working class is so bright! I was so irresponsible in the past, not working hard and not obeying labor discipline, I didn't deserve to be called a worker! Thinking of this, I was so ashamed that I wanted to cry. From then on, I made up my mind to produce well, overcome the shortcomings of not obeying labor discipline, and never play around at work again. In January of this year, the factory received a batch of military shoe production tasks. I knew that these were made for our most beloved people—the volunteers, so I worked even more conscientiously. As a result, the output increased from 20 pairs per day in the past to 60 pairs now, and the quality is much better. Recently, I also participated in political study. I guarantee that under the education of the Party, I will quickly improve my class consciousness, fight to the end for the victorious completion of the national large-scale construction plan, and strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.

    我改正了不守劳动纪律的错误提高了生产
    王淑琴
    我叫王淑琴，是天津私营裕合橡胶厂的粘鞋工人。解放以前，父亲和叔叔都没有职业，母亲给人家当佣工，家里吃了上一顿顾不了下一顿。天津解放的那年，母亲给我说了个婆家，我心里暗想：这下可好了，以后靠着丈夫，吃穿再不用发愁了。
    我的爱人叫郭庆铭，是私营裕合橡胶厂的工人。结婚前他就常劝我上工厂做工，我一听心眼里就不高兴，我想：厂里亲戚朋友那么多，以后结了婚还做工，教人看了多丢人！再说，呆在家里，每天吃完饭刷刷碗就没事了，多自由，一进厂子还得按时上下班，怎么也不如家里好。以后他为了帮助我，三番五次跟我说：在新社会里劳动是最光荣的。妇女在旧社会里受封建压迫被人看不起。今后妇女解放了，但只有自己积极参加劳动，独立自主，经济上不依靠别人，才能做到真正和男子平等。我听着道理也对，但回头一想，怎么还是不如在家里吃吃喝喝、遛遛玩玩的美。以后实在拗不过他，就抱着一种“试试看”的态度。在一九五○年进了裕合橡胶厂学粘鞋。那时厂里有一百多工人，大部分都是青年。我们粘鞋车间也有二十来个工人，看起来怪热闹的，我心想：这里比家里还好玩。那时我上班就和女工们闲扯聊天，有时坐烦了，就到别车间去“串门”，跟男工打闹着玩。下班后也不好好休息，逛大街，看电影，搞得很晚，第二天迟到，生产的时候直打盹。人家一天能粘三十多双鞋，我才粘二十双，还老出残活，原因就是好玩。“五反”以后不久，厂里提拔我为正式工，我想：这一下更好了，以前是个临时工，成天玩玩闹闹，有时总还耽心人家不要自己，现在转了正式工，我就可以更加放心大胆地玩闹，什么也不用怕了！
    我这种错误思想，后来在工会教育下和同志们帮助下才慢慢转变了过来。有几件事情影响我很深。我叔叔在解放以前没有职业，和我们一块整天受苦、挨饿。好不容易熬到解放才当了搬运工人，家里生活也就不再发愁了。去年扛货时，不小心，他把脊骨给砸伤了。这要是在过去就什么全完了，但是在今天，在我们的国家里，工人享受到劳保待遇，我叔叔的伤在人民政府和工会的帮助照顾下，免费治了一年，治好了。不久，我弟弟得了传染病，病的很厉害，就快要死了，家里没有钱，上不了医院，我们急得不知怎么好。派出所知道了，就给开了个免费医疗证。后来我弟弟的病也在医院里治好了。像这样的事情在旧社会里谁能想到呢？我一想起这些事，就从心里感动起来，感谢共产党、感谢毛主席！因为有了共产党和毛主席，我们才有今天。今天我们工人真是做了国家的主人啦！再看看我们国家几年来建设的伟大成就，连我们工厂也有了托儿所（工会为我们工人建立的），我们国家五年计划的大建设也开始了，将来我们的日子一定会过得更美好，更幸福。我们工人阶级的前途是多么光明远大！自己过去那样胡闹不好好干活，不遵守劳动纪律，那儿还配称个工人样？想起这些，我惭愧得真想痛哭一场。从那时起，我下定决心要好好生产，克服不遵守劳动纪律的缺点，工作时再也不玩闹了。今年一月间，厂里接到一批军鞋生产任务，我知道这是做给咱们最可爱的人——志愿军穿的，因此我就加倍认真地干，结果产量由过去每天二十双提高到现在六十双，质量也好多了。最近我还参加了政治学习。我保证在党的教育下，很快提高自己的阶级觉悟，为国家大规模建设计划的胜利完成奋斗到底，争取作一个光荣的共产党员。
