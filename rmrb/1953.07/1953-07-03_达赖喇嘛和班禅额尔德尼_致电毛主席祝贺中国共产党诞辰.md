Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd: On the eve of "July 1st," the Dalai Lama of Tibet sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, congratulating the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The telegram is as follows:

Chairman Mao:
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the imperialist forces have been completely expelled, and all ethnic groups in China have been liberated. In the four years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, great achievements have been made in various construction endeavors. Our people have also achieved brilliant achievements and great victories in helping the Korean people, combating imperialist aggressors, and defending world peace.

In the past two years, people's hospitals and banks have been established in the Tibetan region, the Kangzang Highway has been built, serum factories for the prevention and control of animal epidemics have been constructed, wasteland has been reclaimed for production, and houses have been built. Various construction projects have been vigorously carried out. In particular, the policy of freedom of religious belief has been earnestly implemented in accordance with ethnic policies. I am very excited and relieved that the Buddhist Association of China has been established in the capital, Beijing. The monks studying Buddhism, led by the three major monasteries, and many men and women compatriots, can all believe in Buddhism and recite scriptures according to their own wishes. All the monks and lay people in Tibet have unprecedentedly satisfied their wishes. All these benefits are due to the fact that the Tibetan people have broken away from the shackles of imperialism and returned to the big family of the motherland, and even more so because of the great kindness and virtue bestowed by Chairman Mao, who is impartial and magnanimous. Therefore, foreign enemies dare not harass us in the slightest, and both politics and religion are developing. The Tibetan region is moving towards a path of happiness and prosperity. In the future, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we should continue to strengthen the unity between and within ethnic groups, love the motherland, consolidate the southwest national defense, and work harder to develop the various construction undertakings of the motherland. On the occasion of the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, I would like to extend my congratulations.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd: On the eve of "July 1st," the Panchen Erdeni of Tibet sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, congratulating the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The telegram is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

On the occasion of the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Panchen sincerely leads the political, religious, monastic officials, and masses of Tashilhunpo Monastery to express our supreme respect and congratulations to you with boundless joy and excitement.

Since its birth, the Chinese Communist Party, under your wise and correct leadership, has led the people of the whole country to overcome ferocious enemies at home and abroad, allowing the people of the whole country to be liberated from the abyss of suffering and move towards brightness. In the short four years since the liberation of the whole country, you have again led the people of the whole country to achieve great and amazing achievements in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and in national construction. This has laid a favorable foundation for the industrialization of our motherland and effectively cracked down on the aggressive arrogance of US imperialism, and maintained world peace. As far as Tibet is concerned, under the inspiration and active assistance of your and the Chinese Communist Party's correct policies, it has not only achieved peaceful liberation, allowing the Tibetan people to get rid of the shackles of imperialism, but also achieved new improvements in all aspects of production and construction, medicine and health, culture and education, trade, and the lives of the masses. Lama temples have been protected. Therefore, you and the Chinese Communist Party are the great saviors of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and also a strong pillar for maintaining lasting world peace. In addition to heartfelt gratitude and sending a telegram of congratulations, I will commemorate this great festival with practical actions of continuing to implement the agreement and consolidating the southwest national defense of the motherland in the future.

I respectfully wish you boundless longevity.

Panchen Erdeni, June 29th

    致电毛主席祝贺中国共产党诞辰
    【新华社拉萨二日电】“七一”前夕，西藏达赖喇嘛致电毛主席、中国共产党中央委员会，祝贺中国共产党诞生三十二周年。电文如下：毛主席：中国共产党中央委员会：
    在毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府的正确领导下，彻底地驱逐了帝国主义势力，中国各民族获得解放。中华人民共和国成立四年来，在进行各种建设方面，已经有了伟大的成绩。我国人民在帮助朝鲜人民，打击帝国主义侵略者，保卫世界和平方面，也获得了光辉成就和伟大胜利。
    两年来，在西藏地区成立了人民医院、银行，修建康藏公路，兴修防治兽疫的血清厂，开荒生产，建筑房舍等，已经和正在大力地进行各项建设。特别是根据民族政策，确实的执行了宗教信仰自由政策，在首都北京成立了中国佛教协会，我感到非常兴奋和安心。以三大寺为首的学法僧侣和许多男女同胞，都得按其自己的意愿信佛念经，西藏全体僧俗人民都空前未有地满足了自己的愿望。所有这些好处，是由于西藏人民脱离了帝国主义的羁绊，回到了祖国大家庭中，更由于无分亲疏、鸿恩广被的毛主席的宏恩厚德所赐。因此，外敌不敢丝毫欺扰，政教均趋发达，西藏地区正在走向幸福繁荣的道路。今后在中国共产党的正确领导下，仍当继续加强民族之间和民族内部的团结，热爱祖国，巩固西南国防，为发展祖国的各项建设事业而加倍努力。今当中国共产党成立三十二周年纪念之日，谨致祝贺。
