    Several Questions Regarding the Relationship Between Population Census and Voter Registration
    Central Population Census and Registration Office
    Our current population census is directly serving the general election. The data from the population census serves as the basis for voter registration and as the basis for calculating the number of representatives to people's congresses at all levels. At the same time, this population census and registration is being carried out by general election cadres simultaneously with voter registration. This has led some people to have unclear understandings of the relationship between population census and voter registration. In fact, although these two tasks have many things in common, they also have their differences in many aspects.

    First, although this population census is being conducted simultaneously with voter registration, population census and voter registration are ultimately two different tasks. The reason why the population census is being conducted at the same time as the general election is that our country does not yet have comprehensive and reliable population registration and statistical data to serve as the basis for voter registration and determining the number of representatives. It is not that a population census needs to be conducted simultaneously every time a general election is held, and this population census will also provide accurate population figures for the country's economic and cultural construction in addition to serving the general election. At the same time, the population census and registration work is a national administrative task and should be led by the relevant departments of the people's governments at all levels, which form the population census and registration office. However, because this population census is directly serving the general election and must be carried out simultaneously to save manpower and time, it has been determined that the population census and registration offices at all levels are under the leadership of the election committees at the same level to achieve close cooperation.

    Second, the target of the population census and registration is the entire population of our country. Article 3 of the National Population Census and Registration Regulations stipulates: "All citizens of the People's Republic of China shall be registered." That is, regardless of whether they have political rights and are over or under the age of eighteen, all Chinese people are included in the scope of the census and registration. The target of voter registration, however, is limited to citizens of the People's Republic of China who are eighteen years of age or older. Those under the age of eighteen are not registered, and those over the age of eighteen who are mentally ill and all those who have been deprived of their political rights are also not registered.

    Third, in order to avoid duplication and omissions and to obtain accurate population figures, the population census and registration stipulates a standard time for the census and registration. That is, regardless of whether the census is conducted before or after the standard time, the population registered is the actual population at the standard time. Population increases or decreases after the standard time are not registered or calculated. Voter registration, on the other hand, does not have a standard time. According to the provisions of the Election Law, all citizens who are eighteen years of age or older have the right to vote and should be registered as voters. Therefore, in areas where grassroots elections are held after the standard time, not only should citizens who are eighteen years of age or older at the standard time be registered as voters, but also citizens who have newly reached the age of eighteen between the standard time and the election day should be registered as voters. Only in this way can every citizen who is eighteen years of age or older have the opportunity to exercise their solemn political rights.

    Fourth, this population census stipulates that permanent residents should be surveyed, which is entirely for the accuracy of the population census and registration and to avoid duplication and omissions. However, voter registration cannot only register permanent residents. According to the provisions of Article 4 of the Election Law, the right to vote of every citizen of the People's Republic of China who is eighteen years of age or older is not restricted by the length of residence. Therefore, voter eligibility and the exercise of the right to vote cannot be affected because they are permanent residents, temporary residents, or transient populations. Transient populations can participate in elections in their current place of residence after obtaining proof from their original place of residence.

    Fifth, some places have suggested that, in order to facilitate voter eligibility verification and participation in elections, employees who do not regularly reside in offices, factories, etc., should be registered in offices, factories, etc. This is not in line with the regulations for surveying permanent residents, and will therefore affect the unified standards of the national population census and lead to duplication and omissions in population registration. Registering voters at their permanent residence does not prevent the right to participate in elections elsewhere. Therefore, the registration of employees of offices, factories, etc., should still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Population Census and Registration Regulations. The issue of participating in elections elsewhere can be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Article 46 of the Election Law.

    As mentioned above, the content of the population census can be used as the basic data for voter registration, but the population census and voter registration have different standards and requirements. Only by fully understanding and grasping these similarities and differences can the two be closely coordinated and both the population census and voter registration work be done well.

    关于人口调查与选民登记关系的几个问题
    中央人口调查登记办公室
    我国这次人口调查，是直接为普选服务。人口调查的资料，一方面是选民登记的基础，另方面是计算各级人民代表大会代表名额的依据。同时，此次人口调查登记是由普选工作干部在选民登记时同时完成，这样，就使有些人在人口调查和选民登记的关系问题上，产生了模糊不清的认识。实际上，这两件工作，在许多方面虽有共同的地方，但也在许多方面有其不同的地方。
    第一、这次人口调查，虽是与选民登记同时进行，但人口调查和选民登记究竟是两件不同的工作。这次所以在普选工作的同时举办人口调查，是因为我国还没有全面、可靠的人口登记和统计资料，做为选民登记和确定代表名额的依据。并不是举办一次普选就需要同时举办一次人口调查，而这次人口调查除为普选服务外，也将为国家的经济、文化建设提供确实的人口数字。同时，人口调查登记工作是国家的一项行政任务，应由各级人民政府所属有关部门组成人口调查登记办公室领导进行。但因这次人口调查既系直接为普选服务，又为节省人力、时间，必须同时进行，所以确定各级人口调查登记办公室受同级选举委员会的领导，以达到密切配合的目的。
    第二、人口调查登记的对象是我国的全部人口，全国人口调查登记办法第三条规定：“凡中华人民共和国国民，均应进行登记。”即不论有无政治权利及十八周岁以上或以下，一切中国人都包括在调查登记范围之内。而选民登记的对象，则只限于年满十八周岁的中华人民共和国公民，十八周岁以下的人不予登记，十八周岁以上的精神病患者及一切被剥夺政治权利者也不予登记。
    第三、人口调查登记为了不重复、不遗漏、取得正确的人口数字，规定了调查登记的标准时间，即不论其在标准时间以前或以后进行调查，所登记的人口，都是标准时间的实有人口，标准时间以后增减变动的人口，都不予登记计算。而选民登记则没有标准时间。根据选举法的规定，凡年满十八周岁的公民，都具有选民资格，都应登记为选民。因此，在标准时间以后举办基层选举的地区，不仅应把标准时间年满十八周岁的公民登记为选民，而且要把自标准时间以后至选举日以前这一段期间新增加的年满十八周岁的公民登记为选民。只有如此，才可使每一个年满十八周岁的公民都有可能行使自己的庄严的政治权利。
    第四、这次人口调查规定调查常住人口，完全是为了人口调查登记的准确，避免重复和遗漏。但选民登记就不能只登记常住人口。根据选举法第四条的规定，每个年满十八周岁的中华人民共和国公民的选举权利，并不受居住期限的限制，故不能因为是常住或暂居或流动人口而影响其选民资格及选举权利的行使。流动人口选举权利的行使，可经过原住地的证明在现住地参加选举。
    第五、有的地方提出，为了便利选民资格审查和参加选举，要求将不常住在机关、工厂等的员工都登记在机关、工厂内。这是不符合调查常住人口的规定的，因而就会影响到全国人口调查的统一标准，发生人口登记的重复和遗漏。选民登记在常住所，并不妨碍移地参加选举的权利，所以机关、工厂等员工的登记，仍应按照人口调查登记办法的规定办理；移地参加选举的问题，可按照选举法第四十六条的规定加以解决。
    如上所述，人口调查的内容可以做为选民登记的基本资料，但人口调查与选民登记又各有不同的标准和要求。只有很好地了解和掌握这些相同和不同的地方，才能使两者密切配合，把人口调查和选民登记的工作都作好。
