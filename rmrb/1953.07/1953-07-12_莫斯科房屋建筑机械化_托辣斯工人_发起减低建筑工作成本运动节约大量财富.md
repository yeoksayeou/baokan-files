Xinhua News Agency, Eleventh (Dispatch from) Moscow: Workers of the "Moscow Housing Construction Mechanization" Trust recently put forward an initiative to formulate conventions for reducing the expenses required for machine work, striving to reduce construction costs from all aspects, and saving a large amount of wealth for the country. After the convention was proposed, the workers lowered the originally planned expenses for tower cranes and other machines. For example, the expense of each working shift for each СБК—一 type, T—一二八 type, and БККМ type tower crane has been reduced from 126 rubles to 120 rubles. The expense of operating a five-ton automatic crane has been reduced from 261 rubles to 218 rubles, and the expense of operating a mobile power station has been reduced from 331 rubles to 224 rubles. This trust supplies all housing projects in Moscow with machinery. According to statistics, after implementing this initiative, the construction sector in Moscow will save about one million rubles by the end of this year.

	The machine workers are achieving this goal by tapping into internal potential. They have already gained rich experience in this area. For example, according to current standards, a crane can work 11,520 hours after a major overhaul. However, the workers are all striving to reach the level of Stakhanovite workers. According to their experience, the working time between two major overhauls can be extended by 10 percent. This item alone can save 127,000 rubles by the end of the year. In recent years, the skill level of machinery operators has greatly improved, and most of them have a seven-year education. In the past, a work team leader could only lead three crane operators, but now he can lead six people. Excellent organization of labor can also save 115,000 rubles. In terms of machine installation work, advanced machine workers are now able to greatly shorten crane installation time. For example, Ilya's work team can install a crane that is scheduled to take 15 days in five days, sometimes in three days. Now all installation workers have adopted advanced work methods. Because shortening the installation and dismantling time can save at least 260,000 rubles by the end of the year. The issue of improving labor productivity is also highly valued by the workers. The trust's productivity last year was 4,200 machine working hours per crane, exceeding the quota by 200 hours. Now, the machine workers have put forward a further guarantee to increase it to 4,500 machine working hours. This guarantee will also greatly contribute to reducing costs.

	The Presidium of the Moscow Oblast Committee of the Soviet Housing Construction Industry Workers' Union has approved the initiative of the "Moscow Housing Construction Mechanization" Trust and recommended that the Construction Committee promote it.

### “莫斯科房屋建筑机械化”托辣斯工人  发起减低建筑工作成本运动节约大量财富

    发起减低建筑工作成本运动节约大量财富
    【新华社十一日讯】莫斯科消息：“莫斯科房屋建筑机械化”托辣斯的工人最近提出创议，制订降低机器工作所需费用的公约，从各方面努力减低建筑工作成本，为国家节约大量财富。公约提出后，工人们就把原来计划的塔式起重机和其他机器所需费用降低了。例如，СБК—一式、T一二八式和БККМ式塔式起重机每台每一工作班工作所需费用已由一百二十六卢布降低到一百二十卢布。五吨自动起重机工作所需费用由二百六十一卢布降低到二百一十八个卢布，流动电站工作所需费用由三百三十一卢布降低到二百二十四卢布。这个托辣斯以机械供应莫斯科全部住宅工程。据统计，推行这种创议后，莫斯科的建筑部门到今年年底将可节约一百万卢布左右。
    机械工人们是用发掘内在潜力来达到这个目的的。他们已在这方面获得了丰富经验。例如，按照现在的标准，起重机在一次大修之后可以工作一万一千五百二十个小时。但工人们都在争取达到斯大哈诺夫式工作者的水平，根据他们的经验，机器两次大修之间的工作时间可以延长百分之十。只这一项到年底就可以节约十二万七千卢布。近几年来机械操使者的熟练程度大大提高了，大部分都有七年教育程度。从前一个工作队长只能领导三个起重机操使者，而现在可以领导六个人。由于很好地组织劳动又可以节约十一万五千卢布。在机械安装工作方面，先进的机械工人现已能大量地缩短起重机安装时间。例如，伊利亚工作队在五天内，有时在三天内，就装好一台定额规定需十五天装好的起重机。现在全部安装工人都已采用先进工作法了。因为缩短安装和拆除的时间到年底至少可以节约二十六万卢布。提高劳动生产率的问题也受到工人们的很大重视。托辣斯去年一年的生产率是每台起重机达到四千二百机器工作小时，超过定额规定二百小时。现在机械工人又提出了更进
    一步保证，要提高到四千五百机器工作小时。这个保证也将大大有助于减低成本。
    苏联房屋建筑业工人工会莫斯科州委员会主席团已批准了“莫斯科房屋建筑机械化”托辣斯的创议，并建议建筑委员会加以推广。
