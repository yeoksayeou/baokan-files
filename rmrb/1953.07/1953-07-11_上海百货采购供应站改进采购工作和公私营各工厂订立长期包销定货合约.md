The implementation of the economic accounting system in the national state-owned department store system has enabled the China Department Store Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station to plan and enter into long-term sales, ordering, and processing contracts with public and private daily necessities factories according to the needs of the people in various regions. This has greatly reduced the chaotic phenomenon in purchasing work. As of the beginning of June, the value of long-term sales, ordering, and processing contracts signed by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station with factories has reached 50% of the annual procurement plan. Currently, the signing of long-term contracts is continuing to expand. The signing of long-term contracts will ensure that the main department store supply issues in various markets and the main daily necessities production issues in Shanghai are properly arranged.

The transition from temporary procurement to planned long-term sales and ordering was only realized after the implementation of the economic accounting system. In the past, under the management method of large-scale recycling, procurement work had to be arranged temporarily based on the monthly allocation of funds from the head office and the monthly requisition plans sent by sales units in various regions. Therefore, the blindness and rush nature of procurement work could not be avoided. Although long-term sales and ordering had been implemented for some products in the past, due to the supply system mentality of the staff, they did not understand the production and sales situation, and often purchased many commodities that did not meet consumer needs. After the implementation of the economic accounting system, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station carried out the work of balancing the production and sales of various commodities, which created conditions for planned rather than blind long-term sales and ordering. In the process of balancing production and sales, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station found that some commodities were basically in short supply. Therefore, they mobilized relevant factories to expand production and increased orders or implemented sales to ensure that these commodities were rationally distributed under the unified control of the state. Some factories' products did not meet consumer needs, so the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station mobilized them to improve specifications, quality, and designs, and then signed long-term sales and ordering contracts with them. For example, after investigating the quantity, quality, specifications, and designs of towels needed by consumers in various regions and the towel production situation in Shanghai, the staff of the Cotton Textiles Department found that with the continuous improvement of people's lives in the past three years, the demand for low-end white towels had decreased significantly, while the demand for high-end colored towels was not being met. However, many factories that had difficulties in production and were weaving low-end towels had the conditions to weave medium- and high-grade colored towels. Therefore, they mobilized these factories to switch to weaving medium- and high-grade colored towels and signed long-term sales and ordering contracts with them.

In addition, the staff of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station also had a correct understanding of the rational reserve of seasonal commodities and carried out the work of balancing the peak and off-season production of seasonal commodities, which is also an important reason why procurement work can implement planned long-term sales and ordering. For example, the products of general large shirt factories in Shanghai are in short supply during the peak season, but the peak production season is only more than three months. Department stores purchase very little during other times, and can sometimes only provide temporary care. In the review of anti-supply system thinking at the end of last year, staff members discovered that there was a large inventory of shirts. At that time, some people believed that this was a blind support for production that caused a backlog. Therefore, they stopped the purchase of shirts, which made it difficult for factories to produce. However, after a more accurate understanding of the production and sales situation through the Second National Department Store Supply Conference, it was found that even with the adjustment of inventory, the supply of shirts produced by large factories during this year's peak season still could not meet the needs of various regions. The staff of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station realized from this that the seasonal reserve of certain commodities is reasonable and necessary. The rational adjustment of the seasonal production of these commodities was then taken into consideration. After the staff responsible for purchasing shirts made a plan to balance peak and off-season production based on the production and sales situation, they not only signed sales and ordering contracts for the peak season with more than 20 large factories, but also signed ordering contracts for the off-season.

The improvement of the purchasing work of the China Department Store Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station is of great benefit to both producers and consumers. Factories that have signed long-term sales and ordering contracts with the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station can now plan production according to consumer needs. This improvement will also gradually eliminate the phenomenon of blind and untimely supply in department stores in various regions. Consumers will be able to buy more commodities that meet their needs from department stores in various regions in a timely manner. Summer goods such as tents and mosquito coils, which used to be supplied only in the hot summer months, began to be supplied by state-owned department stores in Shanghai in March and April this year, which is a concrete manifestation of this improvement work.

### 上海百货采购供应站改进采购工作和公私营各工厂订立长期包销定货合约

    上海百货采购供应站改进采购工作和公私营各工厂订立长期包销定货合约
    全国国营百货公司系统实行经济核算制后，中国百货公司上海采购供应站已可以按照各地人民的需要来有计划地和公私营日用品工厂订立长期的包销、定货、加工合约，大大减少了采购工作的忙乱现象。到六月初止，上海采购供应站和工厂签订的长期性包销、定货、加工合约，其金额已达全年进货计划的百分之五十。目前长期合约还在继续扩大签订中。长期合约的签订，将使各地市场的主要百货供应问题和上海的主要日用品生产问题都能得到适当的安排。
    从临时性的采购走向有计划地长期包销定货，是在实行经济核算制后才实现的。过去在大回笼制的经营方式下，采购工作必须根据总公司每月拨款和各地销售单位每月送来的要货计划临时布置，因此采购工作上的盲目性和突击性不能避免。虽然过去也曾对某些产品实行过长期包销、定货；但由于工作人员有供给制思想，不了解产销情况，往往购进了许多不适合消费者需要的商品。实行经济核算制后，上海采购供应站便进行了各种商品的产销平衡工作，这便给有计划的而不是盲目的长期包销、定货创造了条件。在平衡产销工作中，上海采购供应站发现有的商品是基本上不足的，于是便动员有关工厂扩大生产，并向他们扩大定货或实行包销，以便使得这些商品在国家统一掌握下得到合理分配。有的工厂产品不合消费者需要，上海采购供应站便动员他们改进规格、质量、花色，然后和他们订立长期包销定货合约。如棉织品科的职工们调查了各地消费者需要毛巾的数量、质量、规格、花色和上海的毛巾生产情况后，发现三年来人民生活的不断提高，低挡的白色毛巾需要量大减，上等的彩花毛巾已供不应求，但不少生产有困难的、织造低挡毛巾的工厂却有着织造中、上级彩花毛巾的条件。于是他们便动员这些工厂改织中、上级彩花毛巾，并和他们订立了长期的包销、定货合约。
    此外，上海采购供应站的职工们对季节性商品的合理储备也有了正确的认识，并作了平衡季节性商品淡旺季生产的工作，这也是使得采购工作可以实行有计划的长期包销、定货的重要原因。例如上海一般大的衬衫工厂的产品在旺季中是供不应求，但旺产季节只有三个多月，其他时间内百货公司收购很少，有时只能给予临时性的照顾。在去年年底的反供给制思想检查中，职工们发现衬衫库存量很大，当时有人认为这是盲目的扶助生产而造成的积压，因此停止了衬衫的收购，结果使得工厂生产很困难。但通过第二届全国百货供应会议比较正确地瞭解了产销情况后，却发现今年旺季中大厂出产的衬衫供应虽有库存量的调剂，仍然不能满足各地需要。上海采购供应站的职工们从此认识了某些商品的季节性储备是合理的，也是必需的。合理地调剂这些商品的季节性生产便被注意起来。采购衬衫的工作人员根据产销情况作出平衡淡旺季生产的计划后，不仅和二十多家大的工厂订立了旺季的包销、定货合约，而且也订立了淡季的定货合约。
    中国百货公司上海采购供应站采购工作的改进，对有关生产者和消费者都有很大的好处。凡是已和上海采购供应站订立长期包销、定货的工厂，今后可以有计划地按照消费者的需要来进行生产。这一改进也将逐渐消除各地百货商店供应盲目和不及时的现象。消费者将从各地百货商店及时地买到更多的适合他们需要的商品。往年都要大热天才能供应的帐子、蚊香等夏令货，今年上海市国营百货商店在三、四月份就开始供应了，这便是这种改进工作的具体表现。（新华社）
