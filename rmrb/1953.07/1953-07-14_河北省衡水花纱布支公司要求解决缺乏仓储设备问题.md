    Hebei Province Hengshui Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company Requests Resolution of Lack of Warehousing Equipment

    A letter from the Hengshui Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company states: In 1952, the superior company instructed that the purchase of cotton should be based on the principle of local storage. This is certainly correct. However, because the superior company did not promptly resolve the issue of the lack of warehousing equipment for various grassroots units, our work has encountered great difficulties. In the case of our company, the cotton stock at the end of last year was more than 110,000 bales, worth about 200 billion yuan; however, our storage equipment is very poor, with no mats on top and no dunnage underneath, making the cotton very susceptible to damage. At Pingyuan Railway Station, more than 20,000 bales of cotton were rained on three times and snowed on once due to poor storage conditions, resulting in mold and stench, and passers-by felt sorry for the loss of state property. Later, this batch of cotton was transferred away after the Shandong Provincial Company requested instructions from the head office.

    The superior company is aware of the poor warehouse equipment of the subordinate companies but has not actively sought solutions. Most of the warehouses of some branch companies are borrowed open-air warehouses, and some warehouses do not even have a well or water pool, and there is also a shortage of shading mats. Specific suggestions for adding equipment and carrying out construction are submitted to the superior company, but the provincial company can only approve the purchase of a few water tanks and buckets based on its own expenditure authority, which does not solve any problems. Suggestions for warehouse construction problems cannot be answered at all, and it is difficult to get results even if they are forwarded. For example, our company submitted a request this spring to build four water pools, and although the provincial company replied that it had been forwarded, there has been no news to this day. If such necessary equipment is not provided, who should be responsible for any losses to the cotton in storage?

    The recent fires in cotton stored in Shijiazhuang and Handan are a painful lesson. We request that you remind the Central Ministry of Commerce and the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth General Company to quickly take effective measures to help the lower levels solve these practical problems and strengthen the political and ideological education of cadres. Only by starting from these two aspects can we improve cotton storage work.

### 河北省衡水花纱布支公司要求解决缺乏仓储设备问题

    河北省衡水花纱布支公司要求解决缺乏仓储设备问题
    中国花纱布公司衡水支公司来信：一九五二年上级公司指示，收购棉花以就地储存为原则。这当然是对的。但由于上级公司对各基层单位缺乏仓储设备的问题没有及时解决，就使我们工作遭到了很大的困难。就我们公司来说，去年年底的存棉量为十一万余包，价值约二千亿元；可是我们储存设备很差，上无席子，下无垫木，棉花很易遭受损失。平原车站曾经有两万多包棉花因储存条件太差而受过三次雨淋、一次雪淋，结果发霉发臭，过往客人都为国家资财的损失而感到痛心。后来经山东省公司请示总公司，才将这批棉花调走了。
    上级公司对下级公司仓库设备差的情况是知道的，但是没有积极设法解决。有些支公司大部仓库是借用的露天库，有的库连个水井、水池都没有，遮席也很缺少；向上级公司提出添置设备和进行建设的具体建议，但省公司根据自己的开支权限，只能批准买几个水缸、水桶，解决不了什么问题。对建设仓库问题的建议根本没法答复，转呈上去也很难有结果。比如我公司今春曾呈请修造四个水池，省公司虽然答复说已向上转呈了，而直到现在还没有音信。这样必要的设备也不给解决，一旦库存棉花遭受损失，谁该担当这一责任呢？
    最近石家庄和邯郸两地所存棉花失火的事件，是一个惨痛的教训。我们要求你们提醒中央商业部和中国花纱布总公司赶快采取有效办法来帮助下边解决这些实际问题，同时对干部加强政治思想教育。只有从这样两方面着手，才能改进棉花储存工作。
