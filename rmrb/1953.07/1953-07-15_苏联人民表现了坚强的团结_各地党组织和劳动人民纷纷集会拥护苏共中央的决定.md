Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: According to TASS, Party organizations and working people throughout the Soviet Union are holding meetings and mass rallies to discuss the decisions of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet regarding the traitor Beria. These meetings have become powerful demonstrations of the strong unity of the Soviet people and their support for the Party and the government. All those who spoke at the meetings unanimously condemned Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes and expressed great satisfaction with the timely and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet against the enemy of the people, Beria.

	In the Donbas, the Communist Party committees of Stalinino Oblast and Stalinino City, together with Party activists, held a joint plenary session. Those who reported and spoke at the meeting unanimously agreed that the decision of the Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee was of great significance in the lives of the Party and all the Soviet people, and that this decision was warmly supported in all the coal mines and factories, cities and villages of the Donbas. Bukhdurin, the driver of a coal-cutting combine at the Chistiakov No. 3 "B" mine, said that in response to the enemy's vile conspiracy, the miners would unite more closely around the Party Central Committee. Angrily denouncing the adventurer Beria's vile attempt to harm socialist agriculture and undermine the collective farm system, Tractor Team Leader Anglin emphasized that the collective farmers steadfastly trust their Communist Party and the Soviet government, and will continue to work closely with the working class in the future, tirelessly strengthening the collective farm system and building a communist society in our country. Shuvalov, Secretary of the Artemovsk City Party Committee, said that Beria, the enemy of the Party and the people, attempted to alienate the Ukrainian people from the Russian people. However, this despicable element miscalculated. The friendship and unity of our multi-ethnic Soviet people are solid and forever indestructible. Those who spoke at the meeting also criticized the shortcomings in the work of some Party, Soviet, and economic organizations in Stalinino Oblast and proposed methods to overcome these shortcomings. The meeting concluded with the adoption of a resolution unanimously supporting the decision of the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee and guaranteeing to unite more closely around the Party Central Committee.

	In the Georgian Republic, a mass rally was held at the Transcaucasian Iron and Steel Works in Rustavi. Steelworker Kukhaleshvili said at the meeting: When all the Soviet people learned about the criminal intentions of Beria, our despicable enemy, they felt indignant and outraged. We, the steelworkers of Georgia, warmly support the measures taken by the Presidium of the Party Central Committee, which exposed this treacherous enemy, the agent of international imperialism, and prevented him from doing harm.

	In the Belorussian Republic, workers and experts at the Minsk Tractor Factory held a rally in the factory. Young design engineer Vakulenko said at the meeting: When we learned about the crimes of Beria, the enemy of the Communist Party and the Soviet people, our hearts were filled with great indignation. This enemy attempted to undermine the Party's great unity and incite disputes between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. However, his malicious conspiracy has failed. Anyone who dares to harm the interests of our Party and our people will receive the same result. The closely united Party and people are invincible.

	In the Lithuanian Republic, rallies were also held in enterprises in Vilnius and other cities. Assembler Joginis said at a mass rally at an electric meter factory that under the leadership of the great Communist Party, the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union are building a bright and happy life. Beria, the mortal enemy of the people, attempted to create disputes among our fraternal nationalities and undermine their friendship. We, the Soviet people, will never allow anyone to undermine the great friendship between our people. We will do our best to increase our revolutionary vigilance and contribute all our strength to the struggle for the victory of communism.
