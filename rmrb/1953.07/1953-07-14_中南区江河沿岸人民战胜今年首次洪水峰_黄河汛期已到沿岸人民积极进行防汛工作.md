Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 13th: People along the rivers in the Central-South region have overcome the first flood peak of this year and are now continuing to strengthen flood prevention and control work. Since mid-May, heavy rainfall has occurred in the four southern provinces of the Central-South region. The water levels of rivers in the Pearl River Basin, the Dongting Lake system, and the Poyang Lake system have repeatedly risen. Except for the main stream of the Yangtze River, various rivers have generally experienced several flood peaks. The flood levels of some rivers were only a few decimeters lower than the highest historical water levels and warning levels. After the vigorous rescue efforts of the masses led by the responsible cadres of the Party and government in various places, the water levels of various rivers generally dropped before June 20th; some areas where floods had broken through dikes and embankments have now been turned from danger to safety. Since late June, rainfall has generally occurred again in various places, and the water levels of various rivers have rebounded. At present, the rivers in Henan and Hubei provinces have successively entered the tense stage of flood prevention and control work. Farmers along the Ru River and Sha River in the upper reaches of the Huai River in Henan Province, the Bai River and Tang River, tributaries of the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze River and Han River in Hubei Province, under the leadership of flood control organizations at all levels, have organized patrol teams, flood reporting teams, defense teams, and rescue teams, and have prepared a large number of flood prevention materials, ready to fight the upcoming floods.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, July 11th: The flood season of the Yellow River has arrived, and the river water is gradually rising. The people along the banks have actively engaged in flood prevention work. At present, flood prevention materials such as stones, willow branches, piles, and sacks have been prepared in various dike sections, and flood prevention personnel have been stationed on the dikes. Flood reporting has started since July 1st.

    Prior to this, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission jointly organized an inspection team to inspect the river course changes, dangerous engineering projects, and flood storage area work in the 700-kilometer section of the lower reaches of the Yellow River from Zhengzhou to Haikou. Henan and Shandong provinces also successively organized four inspection teams to inspect the preparations for dangerous sections. The two provinces also held Yellow River flood prevention meetings in mid-June and early July, respectively, to specifically study and deploy flood prevention tasks, and established provincial flood control headquarters. Recently, Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and Wang Zhuoru, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, will go down to inspect the flood prevention preparations. Nearly a hundred flood reporting stations, rainfall stations, water level stations, and special flood reporting radio stations have been established in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yellow River. The telephone trunk and branch lines between Kaifeng and Jinan in the lower reaches of the Yellow River have been repaired to facilitate flood reporting. In order to strengthen flood prevention work on the north bank of the Yellow River, the Henan Provincial Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has moved to Fengqiu County, on the north bank of the Yellow River, to work. Shandong Province has also established a sub-headquarters on the north bank. Henan and Shandong provinces have also jointly formed a liaison group in the flood storage area to exchange work progress, water condition changes, and jointly consider opening the spillway weir.

    中南区江河沿岸人民战胜今年首次洪水峰
    黄河汛期已到沿岸人民积极进行防汛工作
    【新华社武汉十三日电】中南区各江河沿岸人民已战胜今年第一阶段的洪水峰，现正继续加强防汛和防洪工作。从五月中旬开始，中南区南部四省多雨，珠江流域和洞庭湖水系、鄱阳湖水系各河流水位曾一再上涨，除长江干流外，各江河已普遍出现过几次洪峰，有些河流的洪水位较历年最高水位和警戒水位仅低几公寸。经过各地党、政负责干部领导群众大力抢救，各江河水位在六月二十日以前就普遍下降；部分地区洪水曾一度冲破堤垸，现在也已转危为安。从六月下旬以来，各地又先后普遍降雨，各江河水位又形回涨。目前，河南、湖北两省各河流已先后进入防汛防洪工作的紧张阶段。河南省境内淮河上游的汝河、沙河，长江支流的白河、唐河和湖北省境内的长江、汉水沿岸农民，在各级防汛组织的领导下，已分别组织了巡逻队、报汛队、防守队和抢险队，置备了大量防汛器材，准备与即将到来的洪水搏斗。
    【新华社开封十一日电】黄河汛期已到，河水正逐渐上涨，沿岸人民已经积极地投入了防汛工作。目前，各堤段的石料、柳秸、桩木、麻袋等防汛器材已准备好了，防汛员已经上堤。从七月一日起，已开始报汛。
    在此以前，中央人民政府水利部和黄河水利委员会曾共同组织检查组，检查了黄河下游郑州到海口段七百多公里的河道变化、险工工程和滞洪区工作情况。河南、山东两省也先后组织四个检查组检查了险工地段的准备工作。两省并在六月中旬和七月初分别召开了黄河防汛会议，具体研究和布置了防汛任务，成立了省防汛指挥部。最近，河南省人民政府主席吴芝圃、山东省人民政府副主席王卓如都将下去检查防汛准备工作。黄河沿岸上、中、下游已设立了近百个报汛站、雨量站、水位站和报汛专用电台，并整修了黄河下游开封到济南间的电话干线和支线，便利报汛之用。为加强黄河北岸的防汛工作，河南省黄河防汛指挥部已移至黄河北岸的封邱县城办公，山东省也在北岸设立了分指挥部，河南、山东两省并在滞洪区共同组成了联络组，以便随时交换工作情况、水情变化和共同考虑开放溢洪堰工作。
