Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 29th: The consequences of America's militaristic and predatory foreign trade policy are becoming increasingly apparent.

     Senator Hubert Humphrey admitted in a speech in the Senate on the 23rd that the U.S. policy of restricting East-West trade, adopted to facilitate control and plunder of other capitalist countries, is suffering serious setbacks. He said: "While the United States is suffering setbacks in world trade policy, the Soviet Union is rapidly reaching trade agreements with one country after another."
     The United States' predatory trade policy (on the one hand, stepping up the export of goods to the capitalist world market, and on the other hand, restricting imports by raising tariffs, etc.) has been countered by other countries, bringing bad results to itself. The U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced trade figures for the first quarter of 1953, indicating that, excluding the $1,232.2 million in exports under the military "aid" program, the U.S. trade surplus in the first quarter of this year was less than $100 million, compared with $1 billion in the first quarter of last year. On the other hand, in the first quarter of 1953, capitalist countries other than the United States increased their gold and dollar reserves by a total of $750 million. In analyzing the reasons for the above situation, the U.S. Department of Commerce pointed out: "This is largely due to a decrease in foreign purchases here and an increase in exports to the United States. The decrease in foreign purchases here is partly due to stricter restrictions on (American) imports by foreign countries..."

     美国对外扩张的贸易政策受挫
     【新华社二十九日讯】华盛顿消息：美国军事性和掠夺性的对外贸易政策的恶果，已愈来愈明显。
    参议员赫伯特·汉弗莱二十三日在参议院发言时承认，美国为了便利对其他资本主义国家的控制与掠夺而采取的限制东西方贸易的政策正遭到严重的失败。他说：“当美国在世界贸易政策上遭到挫折时，苏联正与一个又一个的国家很迅速地达成贸易协定”。
    美国的掠夺性的贸易政策（一方面加紧向资本主义世界市场上输出商品、一方面用提高关税等办法限制入口），遭到其他国家的反击，为它自己带来了恶果。美国商务部最近宣布的一九五三年第一季贸易情况表明：除了军事“援助”计划下总数达十二亿三千二百万美元的出口“贸易”不算外，美国今年第一季度中的出超不到一亿美元，而去年第一季为十亿美元。另一方面，在一九五三年的第一季度贸易中，美国以外的其他资本主义国家增加了总数达七亿五千万元的黄金美元储备。美国商务部在分析造成上述情况的原因时指出：“这大部分是由于外国在此地购买的减少和对美国出口的增加。外国在此地购买的减少，一部分是由于外国对（美国的）进口加紧限制……。”
