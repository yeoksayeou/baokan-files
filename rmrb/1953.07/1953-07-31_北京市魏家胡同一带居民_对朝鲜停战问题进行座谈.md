    Residents of Weijia Hutong, Beijing, Hold a Discussion on the Korean Armistice Issue
    Lu Fuchun of Weijia Hutong Police Station, Dongsi District, Beijing, writes: The Korean armistice negotiations have reached a complete agreement. The residents here were very happy to hear this victorious news, and everyone unanimously expressed their support. On July 28, we convened a discussion with some residents on the Korean armistice issue, and those who attended actively expressed their views and attitudes towards this major political event. They believe that this is a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people in their struggle for peace and against wars of aggression. However, we must remain vigilant, prevent the sabotage of the armistice agreement by some warmongers in the United States and the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique, strive to ensure that all the provisions of the armistice agreement are effectively observed and implemented, and further achieve a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue. Housewife Wang Shihe said: "Since the United States has now expressed its willingness to resolve the Korean issue peacefully in a spirit of consultation, they must guarantee that they will effectively implement all the provisions of the armistice agreement; if they continue to condone the Syngman Rhee group, the people of the world will resolutely oppose it!" Small vendor Zhao Yuming, in his speech, condemned the shameless clamor of the Syngman Rhee reactionary group against the armistice with extreme contempt, saying: "If the United States condones the Syngman Rhee group in sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, the United States government must be responsible for all the consequences; they must strictly implement the guarantees they have made and not go back on their word." Sixty-five-year-old Grandma Jin is a family member of a volunteer soldier. After the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, her second son joined the volunteer army. She often wrote to her son telling him to resolutely defend peace and fiercely strike the aggressors. At the meeting, she said: "We have always been willing to resolve the Korean issue peacefully. In the two years of Korean negotiations, we have made firm efforts and great concessions, and today the armistice agreement has finally been signed. If anyone dares to undermine this agreement, we will resolutely not allow it! I will definitely write to my son and tell him to resolutely implement the orders of Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, strictly abide by the armistice agreement on the one hand, and maintain a high degree of vigilance on the other hand, and resolutely strike whoever dares to undermine the armistice agreement." Volunteer soldier family member Sheng Shiying also expressed that she would write to her husband, Chen Shixing, telling him to continue to fight to the end for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    北京市魏家胡同一带居民
    对朝鲜停战问题进行座谈
    北京市东四区魏家胡同派出所吕富春来信：朝鲜停战谈判已经全部达成协议了。我们这里的居民听到这个胜利消息以后都十分高兴，大家都一致表示拥护。七月二十八日，我们召集了一部分居民座谈朝鲜停战问题，到会的人都积极地表示了对这一重大政治事件的看法和态度。他们认为这是朝中人民争取和平、反对侵略战争的伟大胜利。但是，我们还必须提高警惕，防止美国一部分好战分子和李承晚反动集团，对停战协定的破坏行为，争取停战协定的全部条款得到切实遵守和执行，并进一步使整个朝鲜问题得到和平解决。家庭妇女王世和说：“美国这次既然表示愿意以协商的精神和平解决朝鲜问题，他们就必须保证切实按照停战协定的全部条款去执行；如果他们继续对李承晚集团采取纵容态度，全世界的人民都会坚决反对它！”小商贩赵玉明在发言中以极端卑视的态度斥责了李承晚反动集团反对停战的无耻叫嚣后，说：“要是美国纵容李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战谈判，美国政府就要对一切后果负责任；他们一定要厉行自己提出的保证，不能说了不算。”六十五岁的金老太太是一位志愿军家属，在抗美援朝运动展开以后，她的二儿子就参加了志愿军，她经常写信告诉她的儿子要坚决保卫和平，狠狠地打击侵略者。在会上她说：“我们一直是愿意和平解决朝鲜问题的，在两年多的朝鲜谈判中我们作了坚定的努力和很大的让步，今天终于使停战协定签订了。如果有人胆敢破坏这个协定，我们可坚决不允许！我一定写信告诉我的儿子，要他坚决执行金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的命令，一方面严格遵守停战协定，另一方面也要保持高度戒备，谁敢破坏停战协定就坚决打击它。”志愿军家属盛世英也表示要写信告诉她的丈夫陈世行，要他进一步为和平解决朝鲜问题奋斗到底。
