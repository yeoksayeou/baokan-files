Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: Reports from foreign newspaper reporters on the provocations of fascist elements in the democratic sector of Berlin and certain localities of the German Democratic Republic have provided new evidence proving that the events of the 17th were long premeditated by imperialists. A report by Agence France-Presse on June 23 stated that the notorious West German terrorist organization "Free Jurists Investigation Committee" distributed leaflets in the democratic sector of Berlin. The office of this organization is located in the American-occupied sector of Berlin. The leaflets called on the people to rise up in revolt against the government and state organs of the German Democratic Republic. The special agents exploited the dissatisfaction of a portion of the people, believing this to be a "good opportunity" to overthrow the government. They were also instructed to launch similar actions in various parts of the German Democratic Republic. They openly demanded that criminals be released from prisons. Finally, the fascist assassination gangs demanded the massacre of the people's police, patriotic individuals, and especially the cadres of the Party and mass organizations who resisted them.

    The Berlin correspondent for the London "Evening Standard" testified that on June 17, provocateurs from West Berlin infiltrated the democratic sector in large numbers, carrying out looting and arson in buildings. The report continued that special agents waited for several hours at the border "to cross the border" to carry out activities. "Then the looting began." More reports came from West Berlin: At 10:00 a.m. on June 17, eighty unemployed people aged eighteen to forty were summoned to a building in the British-occupied sector of Berlin. They had all applied for jobs at the West Berlin Customs Bureau. A man in military uniform in the Customs Bureau divided them into groups and sent them to the democratic sector to participate in the riots.

    Similar reports have also come from Tempelhof in the American-occupied sector of Berlin.

    After the failure of the fascist elements of the Berlin murder and terrorist organizations in the democratic sector, they continued to "operate" in West Berlin. In the past two days, the office buildings of various democratic organizations in West Berlin have been attacked many times, including the district office of the Socialist Unity Party. The West Berlin police did not intervene.

    外国报纸的报道
    提供法西斯分子制造骚乱的新证据
    【新华社讯】德意志通讯社柏林二十四日电：外国报纸记者对柏林民主区和德意志民主共和国某些地方法西斯分子的挑拨事件的报道提供了新的证据，证明十七日的事件是帝国主义者长久以来预先谋划好的。法新社六月二十三日的报道说，臭名昭彰的西德恐怖组织“自由律师调查委员会”在柏林民主区散发传单。而这一组织的办公处是在柏林美占区的。传单号召人民起来暴动反抗德意志民主共和国政府及国家机关，特务们利用某一部分人的不满情绪，认为这是推翻政府的“好机会”。他们也奉指示在德意志民主共和国各地发动了这一类行动。他们公开要求人民把罪犯从监狱中释放出来。最后法西斯暗杀匪帮要求屠杀对他们进行抵抗的人民警察、爱国人士特别是党和群众组织的干部。
    伦敦“标准晚报”驻柏林记者证明六月十七日从西柏林来的挑衅分子大批地潜入民主区，进行抢劫和在大厦纵火。该报道继续说，特务分子在交界处等了几个钟头，“以潜越边界”进行活动。“于是抢劫便开始了”。从西柏林传来更多的报道：六月十七日上午十时，有八十个年在十八到四十的失业者被人叫到柏林英占区的一所大厦去。他们都是向西柏林关税局申请职业的。税局里一个着军服的人把他们分成几组，并派他们到民主区去参加骚乱。
    从柏林美占区泰姆派霍夫也传来类似的报道。
    柏林谋杀与恐怖组织的法西斯分子在民主区失败以后，仍然在西柏林继续“活动”。前两天，西柏林各民主组织办公大楼受到许多次袭击，包括统一社会党的区办事处。西柏林警察并不加以干涉。
