Editor's Note: On June 4th, page two of this newspaper published a message titled "Xinhua Bookstore System Achieves Success in Implementing Settlement Methods." The situation reflected in this message was not comprehensive enough, and we did not conduct a detailed investigation and verification before publishing it, resulting in discrepancies with the facts. We are now publishing the news of the Xinhua Bookstore Head Office convening the National Management Committee Enlarged Meeting below, as a supplement and correction to the previous message.

The Xinhua Bookstore Head Office convened its Sixth Enlarged Meeting of the National Management Committee in Beijing from late June to early July. The meeting reviewed the work of the past few years since the national liberation and determined that the bookstore's working guidelines for the next one or two years would be: "Rectify and consolidate, pay attention to improving the quality and effectiveness of distribution work, steadily implement planned distribution, and gradually seek a balance between supply and demand."

The Xinhua Bookstore implemented unified leadership throughout the entire system in 1950. Under the leadership and supervision of local Party committees and governments, it basically overcame the chaotic phenomenon of each region and level of store acting on its own in the early days of liberation, consolidated the leading position of state-owned distribution enterprises, and distributed 80 percent of the nation's published books and periodicals in 1952. Over the past few years, Xinhua Bookstore has widely distributed classic works of Marxism-Leninism, Chairman Mao's works, and other types of reading materials; uniformly distributed textbooks for primary and secondary schools and literacy schools for workers and peasants nationwide; and played an important role in ideological education for people of all strata, in coordination with national construction and social reform. However, the Xinhua Bookstore has had significant blindness in its operations in the past. The most prominent manifestation of this is: failure to properly distinguish the different characteristics of urban and rural areas and to correctly estimate the reasonable needs of urban and rural readers, resulting in a blind and rash tendency in rural distribution work. After the Xinhua Bookstore deployed a large-scale development of rural libraries and the distribution of 100 million copies of books and periodicals on the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign in the spring of 1951, it successively deployed large-scale distributions in rural areas, exceeding the cultural learning and purchasing power of rural readers, resulting in the serious mistake of compulsory distribution divorced from the masses. This situation was only corrected after a general inspection of the entire store was conducted last year under the instructions of the Central People's Government's Publishing Administration. The Xinhua Bookstore also had quite serious blindness in urban distribution. On the one hand, there was an accumulation of unsold books, while on the other hand, classic works, famous literary works, and scientific and technological books were frequently out of stock in large and medium-sized cities, and reading materials to accompany political movements and study movements were often in short supply or not delivered in a timely manner.

Blindness was not only manifested in the estimation of the quantity needed by readers, but also in the lack of understanding of the types and contents of books needed by readers. Sometimes the books readers needed were ordered in small quantities or not ordered at all, while those that were not needed were ordered in large quantities. Many books were piled up in warehouses, but the books urgently needed for study by readers were out of stock everywhere. Books on wheat planting methods in Shandong were sent to Xinjiang and Guangdong, while books on pickled mustard tuber cultivation in Sichuan were sent to Shandong and Jiangsu, where there is no pickled mustard tuber cultivation; industrial and mining areas lacked or even had no books on industry and science and technology, while rural areas had a backlog of them; the deluxe edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "The Socialist Economic Problems of the Soviet Union" were not available in large cities, but many rural branches could not sell them.

The meeting pointed out and criticized the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors, and at the same time revised the Xinhua Bookstore's plan for this year, adjusted the urban-rural distribution ratio, and decided to appropriately reduce the rural distribution volume based on the actual needs and purchasing power of rural readers, and appropriately expand the distribution volume in urban and industrial and mining areas. In-depth discussions were also held and several decisions were made on issues such as resolutely eliminating compulsory distribution and continuing to promote planned distribution.

### 新华书店总店召开全国管理委员会扩大会议  确定今后一两年内书刊发行的工作方针

    新华书店总店召开全国管理委员会扩大会议
    确定今后一两年内书刊发行的工作方针
    编者按：本报六月四日二版发表了“新华书店系统推行结算办法有成绩”的消息。这个消息所反映的情况不够全面，我们在发表以前也未加以详细的调查和核对，以致与事实有出入。现在我们把新华书店总店召开全国管理委员会扩大会议的消息发表在下面，作为对前一个消息的补充和更正。
    新华书店总店六月下旬到七月上旬在北京召开全国管理委员会第六次扩大会议，检查了全国解放后几年来的工作，确定今后一两年内以“整顿巩固，注意提高发行工作的质量和效果，稳步地实行计划发行，逐步求得供需平衡”为该店工作方针。
    新华书店在一九五○年实行全店统一领导，并在各地党和政府的领导与监督下，基本克服了解放初期各地、各级店各自为政的混乱现象，巩固了国营发行企业的领导地位，一九五二年发行了全国出版书刊的百分之八十。几年来，新华书店广泛发行了马克思列宁主义经典著作、毛主席著作和其他各类读物；统一发行了全国中小学课本和工农业余学校课本；对于配合国家建设和社会改革，向全国各阶层人民进行思想教育起了重要作用。但新华书店过去经营上存在很大的盲目性，最显著的表现是：没有很好地区分城市和农村的不同特点，正确估计城市、农村读者的合理需要，在农村发行工作中产生盲目冒进的偏向。新华书店从一九五一年春布置大量发展农村图书室和发行抗美援朝书刊一亿册以后，接二连三地在农村布置大量发行，超过了农村读者的文化学习和购买力的要求，造成严重脱离群众的强迫摊派的错误。这种情况，直到去年下半年在中央人民政府出版总署的指示下，进行了全店的普遍检查，才纠正过来。新华书店在城市发行中也存在相当严重的盲目性，一方面是存书积压，另方面在大中城市中经常发生经典著作、文艺名著、科学技术书籍脱销现象，配合政治运动和学习运动的读物也往往供应不足或不及时。
    盲目性不仅表现在对读者需要量的估计方面，而且也表现在不明了读者所需要的图书的种类和内容方面。有时读者需要的书籍进的很少或者不进，不太需要的反而进的很多。许多书籍积存在仓库里，但读者所迫切需要学习用的书籍却到处缺售。山东种麦方法的书籍发到新疆和广东，四川种榨菜的书籍发到没有榨菜的山东和江苏；工矿区缺少甚至没有工业和科学技术方面的书籍，农村却积压着不少；“毛泽东选集”和“苏联社会主义经济问题”精装本在大城市买不到，不少农村支店却又卖不出去。
    会上指出并批判了上述的缺点和错误，同时修改了新华书店本年度的计划，调整了城乡发行比例，决定根据农村读者实际需要和购买能力适当收缩农村发行量，并适当扩大城市和工矿区的发行量。对坚决消灭强迫摊派和继续推行计划发行等问题，也进行了深入讨论并作出若干决定。
