    The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry convened an equipment maintenance work conference from June 29th to July 4th. In response to the current situation where equipment maintenance and repair work in various factories and mines are not keeping up with production needs, the conference called for further strengthening of equipment maintenance and repair work to ensure the completion of production plans.

    Equipment accidents in factories and mines under the Ministry of Heavy Industry were serious in the first half of this year. The continuous occurrence of equipment accidents and the increase in planned repairs have caused serious losses to state property and have become a major reason for disrupting the realization of work plans. At the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, five consecutive incidents of hanging charges occurred in the blast furnace, resulting in a reduction of more than 30,000 tons of pig iron. At the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, damage to the herringbone gear on the medium-sized steel rolling mill resulted in a reduction of medium-sized steel equivalent to 11 percent of the annual task. From January to April, equipment failures at the Taiyuan Cement Plant frequently occurred, resulting in a reduction in cement production equivalent to the output of a cement plant with a production capacity of 250,000 tons. Due to frequent equipment accidents, the Huaxin Cement Plant did not operate for one-third of the time in the first quarter. As a result, these units did not complete their quarterly or monthly production plans.

    The conference believes that in order to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair work, in addition to the importance attached to this work by leaders at all levels in enterprises, the following tasks must also be done well: (1) Improve the organizational structure of the mechanical and power departments. Each factory and mine must establish a mechanical and power section or unit; a deputy director for equipment or a dedicated technician should be established in the workshop. (2) Each factory and mine must formulate a maintenance plan based on the specific circumstances of equipment utilization and make the maintenance plan an integral part of the work plan. Attention should also be paid to improving the management of spare parts and organizing the production of spare parts, and vigorously tapping the potential capacity of equipment. (3) Establish and improve the responsibility system for equipment maintenance and repair. The administrative side of each factory and mine must cooperate with the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union organization to conduct ideological education on prevention first and love for equipment among all employees, so that all employees develop the habit of complying with equipment operating procedures and operating regulations.

    中央重工业部召开设备检修工作会议
    中央人民政府重工业部在六月二十九日到七月四日召开了设备检修工作会议。这次会议针对目前各厂矿设备维护和检修工作赶不上生产需要的情况，要求进一步加强设备维护和检修工作，以保证生产计划的完成。
    重工业部所属厂矿今年上半年设备事故严重，设备事故的不断发生和计划检修的增多，使国家财产遭受严重损失，并成为破坏作业计划实现的主要原因。石景山钢铁厂高炉连续发生五次挂料事故，使生铁减产三万多吨。太原钢铁厂因打坏了中型钢机上的人字牙轮，就使中型钢材减产了相当于全年任务的百分之十一。太原水泥厂一月到四月份因设备经常发生故障，减产的水泥，相当于一个有二十五万吨生产能力的水泥厂的产量。华新水泥厂因设备经常发生事故，第一季度中有三分之一的时间没有进行生产。因此，这些单位都没有完成季度或月度的生产计划。
    会议认为：要加强设备维护和检修的工作，除了企业中各级领导干部重视这一工作以外，还必须做好下列几项工作：（一）健全机械动力部门的组织机构。每一个厂矿必须建立机械动力科或股；车间内设立设备副主任或专责技术员。（二）各个厂矿必须根据设备利用的具体情况，制订检修计划，把检修计划作为作业计划的一个组成部分。并注意改善备品的管理工作和组织备品生产，大力发挥设备的潜在能力。（三）建立和健全设备维护和检修的责任制度。各个厂矿的行政方面，必须配合党、青年团和工会组织向全体职工进行预防为主和爱护设备的思想教育，使全体职工养成遵守设备使用规程和操作规程的习惯。
