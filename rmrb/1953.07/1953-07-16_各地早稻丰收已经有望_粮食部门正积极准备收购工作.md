Good early rice harvests are expected across the country, with harvesting already underway in some areas. Grain departments in various localities have also made timely preparations for the rice procurement work.

In the Central and Southern District, early rice is growing well. It is estimated that most areas will yield an average of 80% or more of the expected harvest, with many farmers anticipating a 10% to 20% increase in production compared to last year. Currently, in the southern part of Jiangxi Province, counties such as Dayu, Xinfeng, and Ganxian have been harvesting successively since late June. The central and eastern regions are expected to begin harvesting after July 20th. In the southern part of Guangxi Province, early rice harvesting began in mid-June. Counties like Yongning and Hengxian are estimated to increase production by over 10% compared to last year. The early rice in the eastern part of Hunan Province and the Dongting Lake Plain, as well as north and south of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province, is generally expected to increase production by about 10% compared to last year. Hainan Island, in Guangdong Province, where the agricultural season begins earliest, has completed its summer harvest. Other areas have either finished harvesting or are entering the peak harvest season. Overall, a good early rice harvest is assured for the province, except for a small portion that suffered reduced yields due to flooding. In Jieyang County, some villages in three districts experienced reduced early rice yields due to flooding, but the county's total early rice production is expected to increase by about 15% compared to last year. Yuhu District in this county, which was recognized as a high-yield area last year, has increased its early rice production by another 33% this year. In Zhongshan County's Shatian District, a comprehensive early rice harvest is expected, with an estimated increase of 15% compared to last year and a record high yield of 800 catties per mu. In Chao'an County, over 1,300 mu of low-lying fields northwest of the city, which local farmers have traditionally called "Big Sea," "Starving Birds," "Front Lake," and "Back Lake," were often unproductive in the past, with the remaining fields yielding only a little over 100 catties per mu. This year, thanks to improved water conservancy, each mu yielded over 300 catties of grain.

In the Southwest District, Sichuan Province is expecting a bumper harvest from nearly 50 million mu of rice. In the western Sichuan Plain, early rice is blooming and heading, while mid-season rice is also beginning to bud. Many rice stalks are growing almost as tall as a person. Older farmers are generally saying that these are some of the best crops they've seen in decades. In the warmer southern Sichuan areas along the Yangtze River, early rice in seven counties, including Luxian, Naxi, and Jiang'an, has already headed and is producing full and plump ears, ready for harvesting after the end of July. The early rice in the minority areas along the Jinsha River and Red River in Yunnan Province is also producing a good harvest.

In the East China District, Zhejiang Province is about to begin harvesting early rice. The 2.2 million mu of single-season early rice and the early rice within the 6 million mu of double-season rice are now generally entering the heading and ripening stage, and harvesting can begin in late July. In the earlier seasons of Jinhua, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Quzhou and other special districts, early rice can be harvested in mid-July. This year, the early rice stalks in Zhejiang Province are generally round, thick, and evenly tillered. If there are no unexpected disasters, a bumper harvest is expected. Various localities are now actively preparing for the early rice harvest.

This year, all localities have generally paid attention to promoting advanced farming methods, rational fertilization, and the prevention and control of pests and diseases. Local leading organizations have also paid attention to leading farmers in the fight against natural disasters. About 60% of the rice in Sichuan Province has adopted advanced farming methods such as "sparse seedling and close planting," with up to 8,000 to 9,000 seedlings per mu, an increase of 2,000 to 3,000 seedlings compared to last year. Due to the winter rice borer control work last year, insect pests have been greatly reduced this year. Since the beginning of summer, farmers in various localities have been catching moths with lights and pulling out wilted seedlings, which has greatly contributed to the eradication of pests. The amount of fertilizer applied to rice fields in various localities has also increased compared to previous years. From early May to early June, cooperatives at all levels throughout the province supplied farmers with over 33 million catties of summer fertilizer. Farmers in Loufang Village, Danleng County, who used to only apply "one dose of fertilizer when transplanting seedlings and some ash when weeding," are now applying fertilizer three times. Farmers in various localities have also paid attention to the rational application of phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and other fertilizers to prevent rice lodging. All of these have prepared favorable conditions for a bumper rice harvest throughout the province. Fujian Province was hit by a strong typhoon from July 3rd to 5th, but the damage to crops was minor, and early rice is still expected to yield a good harvest. This typhoon was the strongest and most widespread typhoon that Fujian Province has experienced in the past three years. During the period leading up to and during the typhoon, all coastal areas throughout the province took the quickest measures to transmit typhoon warnings. Party and government organs at all levels took emergency measures early on to lead the masses in prevention and rescue. In addition, the weather was clear after the typhoon, which was conducive to the recovery and growth of crops, greatly reducing the typhoon disaster. In the coastal areas from Huian north to Fuan, where the wind was strongest, except for a small portion of rice that was flowering and developing seeds, which will suffer a 10% to 20% reduction in yield, the vast majority of other rice suffered little damage. Most of the early rice in Jinjiang and other counties was already yellow and ripe. After the water was drained from the early rice fields that had been blown down by the wind, there was generally no damage. Judging from the yield of early rice that has already been harvested, this year's harvest is even better than last year's.

Currently, grain departments in some areas are actively preparing for the procurement of rice. In late June, the Finance and Economic Committee of the Hunan Provincial People's Government convened relevant departments at all levels in the early rice producing areas to discuss and specifically arrange the procurement work. Detailed studies were conducted on specific issues such as market management, procurement prices, warehousing and transportation, and improving the management of state-owned grain companies. Relevant financial and economic departments in various counties organized unified procurement committees and are actively preparing. Various counties are planning to train more than 10,000 temporary grain procurement cadres to earnestly implement the state's grain procurement policy. The Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau has issued 100,000 catties of disinfectant and insecticide to warehouses in various localities. In addition to renovating existing warehouses, various counties are also building new simple warehouses and sheds to expand warehouse storage capacity. State-owned trade and cooperative departments are also preparing large quantities of industrial products and fertilizers, and are uniting private merchants and peddlers to organize "peddler teams" to go to the countryside to sell goods. Small-scale material exchange meetings are also being planned in the main rice producing areas to meet the needs of farmers.

    各地早稻丰收已经有望
    粮食部门正积极准备收购工作
    各地早稻丰收已经有望，部分地区已经开始收割。各地粮食部门对收购稻米工作，也都及时作了准备。
    中南区的早稻生长良好，估计大部地区平均可收八成以上，不少农民可比去年增产一成到两成。目前，江西省南部大庾、信丰、赣县等县，六月下旬以来已陆续开始收割。中部和东部到七月二十日后也可开始收割。广西省南部已自六月中旬起开始收割早稻，邕宁、横县等县估计可比去年增产一成以上。湖南省东部和洞庭湖滨平原、湖北省长江南北的早稻，一般也都能比去年增产一成左右。广东省农时最早的海南岛已完成夏收，其他地区有的已收割完毕，有的正进入大割。全省早稻除小部分因受水灾减产外，丰收已定。揭阳县有三个区的部分乡村，早稻被水淹而减产，但全县早稻总产量可比去年增产一成半左右。该县渔湖区去年被评为丰产区，今年早稻又比去年增产百分之三十三。沙田区中山县早稻全面丰收，估计可比去年增产一成半，并出现每亩收八百斤的高额产量记录。潮安县城西北有一千三百多亩被当地农民世代称为“大海”、“饿死鸟”、“前湖”、“后湖”的低洼田，其中六百多亩早稻在往年往往颗粒不收，其余每亩只能收一百多斤；今年由于修好了水利，每亩收了三百多斤谷子。
    在西南区，四川省近五千万亩水稻丰收在望。川西平原早稻正扬花吐穗，中稻也开始含苞，许多稻杆长得几乎有一人高，一般老年农民都说：这是几十年来少见的好庄稼。在气候温暖的川南长江沿岸，泸县、纳溪、江安等七县早稻已抽穗，且穗多粒饱，七月底后就可收割。云南省金沙江、红河沿岸的少数民族地区早稻丰产。
    在华东区，浙江省早稻即将开始收割。全省二百二十万亩单季早稻和六百多万亩双季稻中的早稻，目前已普遍进入结穗成熟期，七月下旬可开镰收割。季节较早的金华、温州、台州、衢州等专区的早稻七月中旬就可收割。今年浙江省各地早稻杆圆、棵粗、分蘖整齐，如无意外灾害，可望丰收。目前各地正积极进行收割早稻的准备工作。
    今年各地一般都注意推广先进耕作方法，合理施肥，防治病虫害；各地领导机关并注意领导农民和自然灾害作斗争。四川省水稻约有百分之六十推行了“少秧密植”等先进耕作方法，每亩最多的有八、九千窝，比去年增加两、三千窝。由于去年冬季开展了稻田治螟工作，今年虫害已大为减少。入夏以来，各地农民点灯捕蛾，扯枯心苗，又为根治虫害作了很大的努力。各地稻田施肥量也比往年增多了。全省各级合作社在五月初到六月初供应农民夏季肥料达三千三百多万斤。丹棱县楼房村农民过去是“栽秧一道粪，薅秧上点灰”，今年普遍施肥三次。各地农民为了防止水稻倒伏，还注意将磷、氮、钾等肥素合理施用。这些，都为全省水稻丰收准备了有利条件。福建省在七月三日到五日受到强大台风侵袭，但农作物损失轻微，早稻仍然丰收。这次台风是福建省三年来所受台风中风势最强，波及范围最大的一次。在这次台风即将来到和袭击期间，全省沿海各地都采取最迅速的办法传递台风警报，各地党政机关及早采取了紧急的措施，领导群众进行防范和抢救；加之台风过后，天气晴朗，有利于农作物的恢复和生长，使台风灾害大大减轻。风势最大的惠安以北到福安一带的沿海地区，除少部分正在扬花孕穗的稻子将减产一成到两成外，其他绝大部分水稻损失轻微。晋江等县早稻大都黄熟，被风吹倒的早稻田经排干了水后，一般没有损失。从已经收割的早稻产量来看，今年收成比去年还好。
    目前，有些地区粮食部门正积极进行收购稻米的准备工作。湖南省人民政府财政经济委员会曾在六月下旬召集早稻产区各级有关部门，开会讨论和具体布置了收购工作。对市场管理、收购价格、仓储运输、改善国营粮食公司的经营管理等具体问题作了缜密研究。各县有关财经部门组织统一的收购委员会，积极进行准备。各县正计划训练临时粮食收购干部一万多人，以便认真贯彻国家购粮政策。湖南省人民政府粮食厅已发给各地仓库消毒杀虫药剂十万斤。各县除整理原有仓库外，并新建简易仓库和棚场，以扩大仓库储蓄量。国营贸易和合作社部门并准备了大批工业品和肥料，团结私商小贩组织“货郎担”下乡销售。在主要产稻地区还准备举行小型物资交流会，以满足农民需要。
