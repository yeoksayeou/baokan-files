    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 23rd: The Gelanghe and Aini Autonomous Region in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, was established on July 15th. This autonomous region is the first one established by the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government Committee to help ethnic minorities within its territory. It is located in the mountainous area between the former Cheli and Fo Hai counties, with a total population of more than 8,400 people, and is a political power equivalent to the district level.
    Before the establishment of the Aini Autonomous Region, the Yunnan Provincial People's Government and the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government sent cadres to the mountainous areas to help the Aini people with preparatory work, and successively trained 23 Aini cadres. During the preparation process, the opinions of the Aini people were highly respected. According to the wishes of the majority of the Aini people and the leading figures who have connections with the people, it was decided that the People's Government of the Autonomous Region would be located in Suhu Mountain, and the name of the Autonomous Region was determined to be "Gelanghe" (meaning happiness).
    At the inaugural meeting of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, Dao Youliang (Dai nationality), Vice Chairman of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government, attended the meeting on behalf of the Dai Autonomous Region People's Government to offer congratulations. He said: "The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region is an autonomous region of the Dai, Aini, Lahu and other ethnic groups. Now that the Aini Autonomous Region has been established, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the higher-level government, we will continue to send cadres to help you and other fraternal ethnic groups, just as the Han people have helped us. We will strive to develop production and trade, establish schools, so that all ethnic groups can live a good life." The Aini people were extremely excited at the meeting. They all expressed that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions in the future and, with the help of the Han, Dai, and other fraternal ethnic groups, manage their own affairs well.

    云南省西双版纳格朗和爱尼族自治区成立
    【新华社昆明二十三日电】云南省西双版纳格朗和爱尼族自治区已在七月十五日成立。这个自治区是西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府委员会帮助境内少数民族建立的第一个自治区。它位于原车里和佛海两县之间的山区，全区有八千四百多人，是相当于区一级的政权。
    在爱尼族自治区成立之前，云南省人民政府及西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府都曾经派出干部到山区帮助爱尼族人民进行筹备工作，并先后培养了二十三个爱尼族干部。在筹备过程中，极为尊重爱尼族人民的意见，根据爱尼族大多数人民和与人民有联系的领袖人物的意愿，确定了自治区人民政府设在苏湖山；并将自治区的名称定名为“格朗和”（意即幸福）。
    在自治区人民政府的成立大会上，西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府副主席刀有良（傣族）代表傣族自治区人民政府到会祝贺。他说：“西双版纳傣族自治区是傣族、爱尼族、拉祜族等各族人民的自治区。爱尼族自治区成立了，我们在共产党和上级政府的领导下，今后仍然要像汉族帮助我们一样，派干部帮助你们和其他各兄弟民族，努力发展生产、贸易，设立学校，使各族人民都过好日子。”会上爱尼族人民无限兴奋，他们都表示今后一定按照毛主席的指示，在汉族、傣族和其他兄弟民族的帮助下，办好自己的事情。
