(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 10th, TASS dispatch): On July 9th, Professor Ikuo Oyama, the distinguished peace fighter and Chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, received the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize at the Sverdlov Hall in the Kremlin, in the presence of many Soviet public representatives.

    Those attending the award ceremony included members of the Soviet Peace Protection Committee, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, the Soviet Writers' Association, the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, scientific workers from the Soviet Academy of Sciences' various research institutes and Moscow University, Soviet writers, cultural and artistic workers, Stakhanovite workers from Moscow factories, and Soviet journalists.

    Also present as observers were the Japanese delegation to the World Women's Congress headed by Hamada Keiei, Japanese trade union worker Kameda Togo, and Professor Mikaawa Masao, the Japanese representative to the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting, who is currently visiting the Soviet Union.

    At 2:00 PM, Professor Ikuo Oyama, the winner of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, and his wife entered the hall. Following them were Academician Dmitri Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize Committee, Committee members Ilya Ehrenburg, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Protection Committee Nikolai Tikhonov, and others.

    The attendees welcomed Ikuo Oyama – the outstanding leader of the world peace movement, the oldest and bravest fighter striving to establish a peace-loving and democratic Japan – with stormy and prolonged applause.

    The committee's decision of December 20, 1951, to award the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize to Professor Ikuo Oyama was read in Russian and Japanese.

    In a short speech, Academician Skobeltsyn spoke about the great significance of awarding the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize to a representative of the Japanese people, introduced the winner's life and career, and expressed respect for Ikuo Oyama's outstanding contributions to the struggle against militarism and in defense of peace in the Far East and the world. When Academician Skobeltsyn presented the certificate and gold medal to Ikuo Oyama, stormy and prolonged applause once again resounded in the hall. Representatives from Soviet mass organizations and scientific departments delivered speeches expressing their heartfelt congratulations. Chairman of the Soviet Peace Protection Committee Tikhonov, Academician Alexandrov of the Academy of Sciences, member of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee Yekaterina Vashukova, writer Agapov, and Moscow University professor Yefimov warmly congratulated the winner, and pointed out that awarding the prize to Ikuo Oyama would help strengthen the friendly feelings between the Soviet and Japanese peoples, and the friendship between the two peoples would continue to develop and consolidate despite the conspiracies of the enemies of the Japanese and Soviet peoples.

    Akamatsu Toshiko, a member of the Japanese women's delegation who had won the World Peace Council's International Peace Gold Medal, was warmly welcomed by the attendees when she delivered a speech. She warmly congratulated her teacher, Professor Ikuo Oyama, saying that receiving the prize was not just his personal joy. "This is the joy and honor of the honest people of Japan, the joy and honor of all the mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters who cherish peace, support Professor Ikuo Oyama's struggle for peace, and fight against persecution. This is not only the joy and honor of the Japanese people but also the joy of the French, Chinese, Germans, Egyptians, Africans, Indians, Americans, Czechoslovakians – all peace-loving people around the world.

    "This is particularly encouraging for the brothers in Korea and Vietnam, who have suffered as much as the Japanese people, or even more. It also makes our Soviet brothers happy, as they understand very well why Professor Ikuo Oyama came to receive the prize a year after it was announced.

    "How significant is the fact that a Japanese women's delegation is present today! For the first time in Japanese history, Japanese women are participating in the World Women's Congress. Japanese women fought alongside all the Japanese people to ensure that the delegation could go abroad.

    "This fact is extremely important for the great cause of world peace. In this way, we are moving towards peace step by step. On this happy and glorious day, as yesterday and tomorrow, the struggle of peace-loving people in Japan and around the world will not stop."

    Akamatsu Toshiko concluded her speech by shouting: Long live world peace! Long live the Soviet Union, the fortress of peace! Long live the progressive cultures of all countries!

    The warm welcome moved Professor Ikuo Oyama, the winner of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, greatly. He delivered a short reply amid the attentive listening of the attendees.

    Ikuo Oyama's reply is as follows:

    Mr. Chairman, dear friends! Today is the greatest day of my life. When I learned at the end of December 1951 that I had been selected as one of the winners of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, I understood and stated publicly that this noble honor was not for me personally, but primarily for the Japanese people. I thought of the many ordinary Japanese people who, in more than thirty years of difficult circumstances, have accumulated experience in the struggle to prevent war and defend peace.

    Please allow me to tell you about the situation over these thirty years, even if it is only in a few short sentences.

    Thirty-five years ago, as the First World War was coming to an end, a democratic movement began to rise in Japan. This movement inspired workers, farmers, and the broad masses of laborers to resist the capitalists, who were particularly rampant after the war. In this situation, the liberation movement developed on a national scale in Japan for the first time. Of course, the rise of this movement was fundamentally the inevitable result of the historical development of our country. However, the influence of the Russian Revolution of 1917 greatly promoted the rise of the movement.

    During the Russian October Revolution, I was a commentator for the Osaka "Asahi Shimbun," which at the time was the most powerful of the democratic newspapers in Japan. The enthusiastic concern shown by Japanese progressive intellectuals, especially Japanese workers and farmers, when they heard about this great epoch-making event in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century gave me an indelible impression.

    Through the Osaka "Asahi Shimbun," we called on the masses to oppose the Japanese army's participation in the intervention in Siberia and convened a journalists' conference advocating the overthrow of the militarist Terauchi cabinet, which was in power at the time.

    In order to retaliate against the actions of the journalists, the Terauchi cabinet decided to close down the Osaka "Asahi Shimbun." We, who had participated in the journalists' conference, had to resign. Afterwards, I taught at Waseda University and, together with the students, continued to oppose the military. This was in 1923. At that time, the military attempted to turn all Japanese universities into centers of militarist education, but student groups firmly opposed the military's conspiracy. At that time, although the number of progressive workers in Japan was small, they actively supported the students. The advanced elements of the working class and farmers began to seriously study the essence of imperialism. Lenin's works on imperialism were particularly widely welcomed.

    In 1925, the Universal Suffrage Law (although it only stipulated suffrage for men) was promulgated. Among the working class, farmers, and other strata of working people, there was a widespread demand for the establishment of their own political organizations. The Labor-Farmer Party, established in 1926, was one such militant party of the working people. I was elected chairman of this party and resigned from my job at Waseda University. The main purpose of the Labor-Farmer Party was to fight for political freedom and against imperialism. The aim of the Japanese people's democratic movement was to eliminate the danger of the Second World War, which was maturing. In this sense, this movement was the precursor of the current Japanese peace movement. However, the ruling class disregarded the will of the people and continued to prepare for war. In 1931, Japanese warlords launched a war in Manchuria, which was the first step in launching the Second World War. The Labor-Farmer Party and all other anti-imperialist organizations were dissolved. I also had to leave. The working masses of Japan suffered a defeat at the most critical juncture. They were unable to stop the evil actions of the Japanese warlords, which dragged the Japanese people into the Second World War and brought unprecedented disasters to the people of other countries. The Japanese people still feel deeply ashamed of this today. However, they have firmly sworn that under no circumstances will they allow history to repeat itself. I consider it a great honor to be able to explain this to everyone on this platform. (Applause)

    In any case, history irrefutably proves that despite suffering great sacrifices, the Japanese people have been waging an unyielding struggle to stop war for more than thirty years. When I learned that I had been awarded the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, this was the first thing I thought of. If this most glorious prize in the world were only awarded to me personally, I might not have the courage to accept it. However, I accepted it without hesitation because I believed that this was a noble reward to the working people of Japan, represented by me. I told the Japanese people that I would be very happy to accept this glorious award and would defend it together with the Japanese people, even at the cost of my life.

    We certainly know that in the current situation, with reactionaries and fascists launching a new offensive around the world, the victory of our struggle to defend peace cannot be easily achieved.

    However, the broad masses of the Japanese people, especially the most progressive elements among them, are fully determined to achieve victory in this struggle.

    All peace-loving people are now deeply convinced that any international dispute can be resolved through consultation. The entire resolution of the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting is permeated with this spirit. However, unfortunately, the fate of our motherland, Japan, is now in the hands of those who are unwilling to consult. They are attempting to turn Japan into a bridgehead for war against the people of the world once again. The forces of Japanese militarism are reviving. Japanese industry is being transformed into an arsenal of war. There is only one way to maintain peace in Japan and the world. The Japanese people must resolutely and firmly say "no" to these evil plans and actively fight to prevent the implementation of these plans.

    Only in this way can we prove the possibility of maintaining peace through consultation to those who do not recognize this possibility.

    Only the Japanese people's resolute struggle for peace and national independence can force those who are unwilling to hold peace consultations to abandon their war plans. The heroic struggles of the Korean, Vietnamese, and Malayan peoples, who are fighting for the independence of their motherlands, clearly prove this. I am very happy to tell you that the Japanese people will never lag behind other brotherly countries in Asia and will never contribute less to the effort to force those who are fully armed to accept peace. (Applause)

    A widespread mass movement against the establishment of military bases is now unfolding throughout Japan, with the participation of workers, farmers, and fishermen. More than three million organized Japanese workers have announced that they will hold a general strike to stop the parliament from passing a reactionary labor bill that deprives workers of the right to strike and turns them into blind tools of war policies. Therefore, the Japanese people are contributing to the cause of defending world peace.

    In the past, the Japanese people have risen up more than once to wage resolute struggles against imperialist wars. However, at that time, this struggle was limited to Japan. After the Second World War, to be more precise, since 1949, the mainstream of the Japanese peace movement has become an inseparable part of the unified, worldwide peace front led by the World Peace Council. From this time on, the resolutions of the successive World Peace Congresses have specifically pointed out the importance of the Japanese issue and pointed out the correct path for resolving the Japanese issue. Therefore, the Japanese people have come to realize that they are not isolated in their struggle for peace, but that they are part of the strong forces of the international peace camp. Therefore, the purpose of the Japanese people's struggle is not only to defend their national independence and right to life but also to defend world peace. We believe that if the Japanese people fully understand the importance of the mission entrusted to them and fight with all their strength to maintain peace, they will receive the support of all peace-loving people in the world.

    Before we came to Moscow, we already understood this in general terms. However, in Moscow, we saw new and truly great undertakings. Here, we not only saw the great construction projects that have epoch-making significance for mankind but also knew that this construction is based on a strong belief in defending lasting world peace. From the early days of the Japanese liberation movement, we have often dreamed of the living conditions of the new Russian people after the revolution. Now, we see that these dreams are a reality that can be touched every day. The lives of the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union are the highest example for all mankind. Here, we not only clearly see the traces of the entire journey that mankind has experienced in the past but also see the bright future of mankind. We are very pleased that the people who have been completely liberated from the shackles of capitalism and the people who are still fighting for their liberation now have a common goal – to fight for peace.

    In the Soviet Union, we have been mentally prepared to return home and continue to fight for peace with all the people with greater determination. We hope that this trip to Moscow will help us achieve new victories in the struggle. The declaration of the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting stated: "We have the ability to achieve peace. We have a responsibility to win peace." The Japanese people will respond to this call. We swear on behalf of the Japanese people that we will work with the peace-loving people of the world to fulfill Stalin's great legacy – to defend peace.

    Long live peaceful coexistence among the people of the world! (Prolonged, stormy applause)

    参加典礼者以暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声欢迎大山郁夫——世界和平运动的杰出领袖、争取建立爱好和平的、民主的日本的最老的、勇敢的战士。
    会上用俄语和日语宣读了委员会一九五一年十二月二十日关于颁发“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金给大山郁夫教授的决定。
    斯科贝尔琴院士在简短的演说中，谈到以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金给予一个日本人民的代表的重大意义，并介绍了得奖人的生平事业，同时对大山郁夫在反对军国主义、保卫远东与世界和平的斗争中的杰出贡献表示敬意。当斯科贝尔琴院士将奖状和金质奖章授给大山郁夫的时候，大厅中再一次地响起了暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。苏联群众团体和科学部门的代表都发表演说，表示衷心的祝贺。苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫，科学院院士亚历山德罗夫，苏联妇女反法西斯委员会委员叶卡捷琳娜·瓦修科娃，作家阿加波夫，莫斯科大学教授叶菲莫夫都热烈祝贺得奖人，并指出以奖金授与大山郁夫有利于加强苏联和日本人民之间的友好感情，苏日两国人民的友谊将不顾日本与苏联人民的敌人的阴谋而继续得到发展与巩固。

    热烈的欢迎使“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人大山郁夫教授很受感动，在参加典礼者的注意倾听下，他发表了简短的答词。
    大山郁夫的答词如下：
    主席先生，亲爱的朋友们！今天是我一生中最伟大的一天。当我在一九五一年十二月底获悉我被选为“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人之一的消息时，我了解并且公开地表明：这种崇高的荣誉不是给我个人的，而首先是给日本人民的。我想到许多普通的日本人民，他们在三十多年的困难处境中，积累了防止战争和保卫和平的斗争经验。
    请允许我把这三十多年的情况告诉你们，即使是短短的几句也好。
    三十五年以前，当第一次世界大战即将结束的时候，日本开始兴起了民主运动。这种运动鼓舞了工人、农民和广大的劳动群众对战后特别猖獗的资本家进行反抗。在这种情况下，解放运动第一次以全国规模在日本发展起来了。当然，这个运动的兴起基本上是我们国家的历史发展的不可避免的结果。但是一九一七年俄国革命的影响大大促进了运动的兴起。
    在俄国十月革命的时期，我是大阪“朝日新闻”的一个评论员，当时这是日本民主报刊中最有力量的报纸。日本进步知识分子、特别是日本的工人和农民，在听到二十世纪初俄国这一伟大的划时代的事件时所表现的热烈的关切给我一个永远不会磨灭的印象。
    我们通过大阪“朝日新闻”，号召群众反对日本军队参加对西伯利亚的干涉，并且召集了主张推翻当时当权的军国主义寺内内阁的新闻记者会议。
    寺内内阁为了对新闻记者的行动进行报复，决定要封闭大阪“朝日新闻”。我们这些参加新闻记者会议的人们就不得不辞职。以后，我便在早稻田大学教书，和学生一起，继续反对军部。这是一九二三年的事情。当时，军部企图把日本的大学都变成军国主义教育的中心，但是学生团体坚决反对军部的阴谋。当时日本进步工人虽然为数很少，但他们都积极地支持学生。工人阶级和农民中的先进分子开始认真地研究帝国主义的本质。列宁关于帝国主义的著作特别受到广泛的欢迎。
    一九二五年，普选法（虽然其中只规定男子有选举权）颁布。在工人阶级、农民和其他阶层的劳动人民中，普遍产生了建立自己的政治组织的要求。一九二六年建立的劳农党是劳动人民的这种战斗的党派之一。我当选为这个党的主席，于是便辞去了早稻田大学的工作。劳农党的主要宗旨是为争取政治自由、反对帝国主义而斗争。日本人民的民主运动的目的是要消除正在成熟中的第二次世界大战的危险。在这个意义上，这个运动是目前日本和平运动的先驱。但是统治阶级不顾人民的意愿，继续进行战争准备。一九三一年，日本军阀在满洲发动了战争，这个战争是发动第二次世界大战的第一步。劳农党以及一切其他反对帝国主义的组织都被解散了。我也不得不出走。日本的劳动大众在最紧急的关头遭受了失败。他们没有能制止日本军阀的罪恶行动，使日本人民卷入第二次世界大战并给其他国家的人民带来了空前的灾难。日本人民到今天还因此深感惭愧。然而，他们坚决宣誓，在任何情况下他们决不容许历史重演。我认为能够在这个讲台上向大家说明这一点是很大的光荣。（掌声）
    无论如何，历史无可辩驳地证明：尽管遭受了很大的牺牲，日本人民三十多年以来一直在为制止战争进行不屈不挠的斗争。当我知道被授予“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金时，我首先就想起了这一点。如果这个世界上最光荣的奖金只是授给我个人的话，我也许就不会有勇气来接受。可是，我毫不踌躇地接受了，因为我认为这是授给以我为代表的日本劳动人民的崇高奖励。我告诉日本人民，我将非常高兴地接受这一光荣的奖励，并将与日本人民一起来保卫它，即使牺牲生命也在所不惜。
    我们当然知道，在目前全世界反动派和法西斯发动新攻势的情况下，我们保卫和平的斗争的胜利不是轻易可以取得的。
    可是，日本的广大人民，特别是其中最进步的分子，完全有决心在这场斗争中取得胜利。
    所有爱好和平的人民现在都深信，任何国际争端都可以用协商方式解决。世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的全部决议就贯穿着这种精神。但是，不幸，我们的祖国、日本的命运现在被掌握在那些不愿协商的人们手中。他们企图再度把日本变成反对全世界人民的战争的桥头堡。日本军国主义的势力又在复活。日本的工业正被变为战争的兵工厂。只有一个办法才可以维护日本和全世界的和平。日本人民必须断然地、坚决地向这些罪恶的计划表示：“不行”，并且最积极地为防止这些计划的实现而斗争。
    只有这样，我们才能向那些不承认可能用协商方式来维护和平的人证明这种可能是存在的。
    唯有日本人民为争取和平与民族独立而进行坚决斗争，才能强迫不愿举行和平协商的人们放弃他们的战争计划。正在为祖国的独立而战斗的朝鲜、越南和马来亚人民的英勇斗争就很清楚地证明了这一点。我很高兴地告诉你们：日本人民决不会落在亚洲其他兄弟国家的后面，决不会在强迫那些全身武装的人们接受和平的努力中少出一分力量。（鼓掌）
    反对建立军事基地的广泛的群众运动现在正在日本各地展开，参加这个运动的有工人、农民和渔民。三百多万有组织的日本工人宣布：他们将举行一次总罢工来阻止议会通过剥夺工人罢工的权利并把工人变为战争政策的盲目工具的反动劳工法案。因此，日本人民正在对保卫世界和平事业作出贡献。
    以往，日本人民不止一次地起来为反对帝国主义战争而进行坚决的斗争。但是当时这种斗争只局限在日本国内。在第二次世界大战以后，说得更准确一点，从一九四九年以来，日本和平运动的主流已经成为以世界和平理事会为首的统一的、世界规模的和平阵线中的不可分的一部分。从这时起，历次世界和平大会的决议都特别指出日本问题的重要性，为解决日本问题指出了正确的道路。因此，日本人民都了解到，他们在争取和平的斗争中不是孤立无援的，他们是国际和平阵营强大力量的一部分。因此，日本人民斗争的目的不仅是保卫他们的民族独立和生活权利，同时还要保卫全世界的和平。我们相信，假使日本人民充分了解到付托给他们的使命的重大，并以他们的全部力量来为维护和平而斗争，他们将得到全世界爱好和平的人民的支持。
    我们在到莫斯科以前，我们就已经大体上明白这一点了。可是，在莫斯科我们看到了新的、真正伟大的事业。在这里，我们不但看到对人类有划时代意义的伟大建设工程，并且知道这种建设是基于对保卫世界持久和平的坚强信心之上的。从日本解放运动初期，我们就常常梦想，革命以后新的俄国人民的生活的情况。现在，我们看到这些梦想已经是一个每日都可接触到的现实了。苏联各族人民的生活是全人类最高的榜样。在这里，我们不但清楚地看到了人类以往经历的全部路程的痕迹，也看到了人类光明的未来。我们很庆幸，已经完全从资本主义的奴役之下解放出来的人民和仍然在为他们的解放而斗争的人民现在有了一个共同的目标——为和平而斗争。
    在苏联，我们在精神上已有所准备，准备回国后用更大的决心与全体人民一起继续为和平而斗争。希望这次莫斯科之行能帮助我们在斗争中获得新的胜利。世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的宣言中说：“我们有能力实现和平。我们有责任来赢得和平。”日本人民将响应这一号召。我们代表日本人民宣誓，我们将与世界上爱好和平的人民一起来完成斯大林的伟大遗训——保卫和平。
    全世界人民和平共处万岁！（经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声）
