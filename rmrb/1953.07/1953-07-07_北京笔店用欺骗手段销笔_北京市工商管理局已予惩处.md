    Beijing Pen Store Uses Deceptive Means to Sell Pens
    Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce Has Punished It
    Letter from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Administration for Industry and Commerce: Our bureau has received numerous letters from people across the country, reflecting the illegal activities of the Beijing Pen Store on Yangmeizhu Xie Street in this city, which deceives the masses. After our investigation, the situations reflected by people across the country are indeed true. The store sells fountain pens from the Shanghai Feima and Universe Pen Factories, and then promotes them to government agencies, organizations, and military units across the country under the name "Beijing Gold Pen." The store distributes a large number of false promotional advertisements, claiming that they "have a mail-order department and a processing inspection team," and that the store's fountain pens are "genuine platinum nibs," "precisely constructed," and "low-priced." In reality, the store has no mail-order department or processing inspection team. The purchase price of the "Beijing Gold Pens" it sells is 12,080 yuan, and the selling price is 19,000 yuan, with profits higher than those of general counterparts; however, the quality of the pens is rough and poor. For example, among the fifteen fountain pens purchased from the store by cadres of the Jinxi County People's Government in western Liaoning Province, fourteen had deformed barrels and detached nibs, making them unusable. People across the country have suffered great losses from being deceived into buying pens.
    In order to protect the interests of the people and stop this deceptive behavior of the store, our bureau handled this issue in March of this year, prohibiting the store from engaging in deceptive publicity in the future. However, even during the handling process, the store sent out more than 3,000 copies of deceptive advertising leaflets to all parts of the country, continuing to seek illegal profits. Now, our bureau has made the following handling decision regarding the store:
    1. Stop the store's "mail-order business"; 2. For those who have sent pen deposits from various places but have not yet received the pens, the deposits must be returned to the original owners by June 20; 3. Impose a fine of 15 million yuan.

### 北京笔店用欺骗手段销笔  北京市工商管理局已予惩处

专栏：读者来信摘要

    北京笔店用欺骗手段销笔
    北京市工商管理局已予惩处
    北京市人民政府工商管理局来信：我局先后接到各地人民群众的不少来信，反映本市杨梅竹斜街北京笔店欺骗群众的不法行为。经我们调查，各地群众所反映的情况是确实的。该店贩卖上海飞马、宇宙笔厂的钢笔，然后以“北京金笔”的名义向全国各地机关、团体、部队推销。该店大量散发虚伪的宣传广告，说是他们“设有函购部，加工检查组”，该店钢笔都是“真白金尖”、“构造精密”、“售价低廉”。而实际上，该店根本没有函购部和加工检查组，出售的“北京金笔”进货价一万二千零八十元，售价是一万九千元，利润高于一般同业；而笔质粗糙恶劣，如辽西省锦西县人民政府干部向该店购买的十五枝钢笔中就有十四枝笔杆变形，笔尖脱掉不能使用。各地群众被骗买笔所受损失很大。
    为了保障人民利益，制止该店这种欺骗行为，我局在今年三月份曾对这个问题进行处理，禁止该店今后再进行欺骗宣传。但就在处理过程中，该店又向全国各地寄出欺骗性广告单三千余份，继续谋取非法利润。现在我局已对该店作了如下处理决定：
    一、停止该店“函购业务”；二、各地寄来的钢笔定款，现在钢笔尚未寄出者，应在六月二十日前一律将定款退还原主；三、处以罚金一千五百万元。
