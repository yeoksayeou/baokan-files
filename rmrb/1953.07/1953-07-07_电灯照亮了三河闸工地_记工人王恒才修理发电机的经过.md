The Electric Lights Illuminate the Sanhe Sluice Construction Site
    ——A Record of Worker Wang Hengcai's Repair of the Generator
    *Tide*

At night, the Sanhe Sluice construction site is very busy. Under the dense layers of electric lights, the sound of motors vibrates the earth. Thousands of dump trucks and flatcars speed along the crisscrossing railways. More than sixty thousand laborers carry loads, moving like many black dragons.

Suddenly, the electric lights went out, the machines stopped roaring, and the seventy thousand plus laborers, military personnel, workers, and cadres who were working enthusiastically all stopped what they were doing. Some complained, some cursed: "Damn it, how discouraging! It's that 'old timer' generator causing trouble again!"

This "old timer" generator would break down every three hours. It was sold to the Sanhe Sluice Engineering Headquarters by a private factory in Shanghai. The contract stipulated a six-month trial period; during the trial period, if the machine had major problems, it would be returned to the original owner; if it didn't have major problems, the deal was done. In order to make this deal, the boss sent two technical workers, Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin, to accompany the machine, so that it would not break down during the trial period. He instructed the two of them not to let anyone else operate the machine when he wasn't there; if the machine had problems, they should repair it in the original way, without making any modifications; if they didn't follow his instructions and damaged it, they would be responsible. This generator was very old, and many parts were not original. After arriving at Sanhe Sluice, Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin followed the boss's instructions, treating the symptoms but not the cause, for over two months, without fundamentally improving the machine.

Wang Hengcai was originally a lathe worker and a very impatient person. In November 1951, he volunteered to participate in the Huai River control project. He actively sought ways to improve efficiency in the construction of the Huaifubridge project, and was awarded a second-class merit. Because he knew how to repair machines, after arriving at Sanhe Sluice, the Mechanical Brigade assigned him to the generator workshop to assist Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin in repairs.

After Wang Hengcai arrived at the generator room, he disassembled the machine and carefully inspected it, repaired some minor problems, and started it up. But after less than three hours, he discovered that the cylinder was leaking air, and smoke was coming out of the return water pipe.

After stopping the machine, Wang Hengcai seemed to see more than seventy thousand workers, laborers, and cadres, and dozens of machines standing before him, demanding electricity. It would take at least half an hour to get another generator started, and everyone could resume work. Wang Hengcai calculated: if seventy thousand people stopped working for half an hour each day, it would add up to thirty-five thousand hours, which would take one person twelve years to make up for. Wasting twelve years in one day, and if this waste continued for ten days, it would never be made up for in a lifetime. What a great loss this would be for the construction of the motherland! Thinking of this, his heart felt like it was being pricked by needles.

The workers and military personnel in the generator workshop originally had no confidence in repairing this machine. Seeing that Wang Hengcai didn't fix it the first time, they were even more discouraged and said in unison: "Such an old machine shouldn't be displayed at Sanhe Sluice to embarrass us, it should have been sent to a museum long ago." Wang Hengcai strongly opposed these words, saying: "Our country doesn't have many machines now, and broken machines should be used as good machines; repairing broken machines is a difficult task, but our working class should have the courage to overcome difficulties, and shouldn't be discouraged in the face of difficulties."

The military personnel who were just learning technology and didn't understand many technical issues, had their confidence boosted under his encouragement. But Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin didn't believe his words.

Why did the cylinder burn out after less than three hours, and why was smoke coming out of the water pipe? Wang Hengcai couldn't wait to find out the reason, come up with a repair plan, fix the machine, and enable the construction site to work around the clock. He studied the machine's problems all day long. In less than three days, his face was covered in grease, his eye sockets were sunken, and his eyes were red and swollen like ripe apricots.

Wang Hengcai became ill from exhaustion, his head aching as if it were about to explode, his body burning as if it were on fire. Sometimes, standing next to the machine, he felt dizzy, as if the work shed was spinning above his head, the ground was rolling beneath his feet, and his body was standing on a small boat, sailing into the stormy sea. The team leader knew he was an impatient person, and personally came to the generator room to ask him to rest. He himself felt too tired and needed rest. But when he thought that this generator was the heart of the Sanhe Sluice project, and that if it stopped beating, the entire project would be affected, he resolutely refused to rest. He said to the team leader: "If the generator is not repaired, my heart won't let me rest for a day."

One day, while the generator was running, Wang Hengcai saw black smoke billowing from the chimney from afar, swirling above the work shed. He remembered that it burned seven gallons of oil per hour, one gallon more than a normally running machine, the cylinder would burn out in less than three hours, and smoke was coming out of the water pipe... Based on all this, he determined that the oil head was injecting oil too early and too much, the heat burned the cylinder bed, and the diesel fuel was not burning cleanly, which is why black smoke was coming out of the chimney.

He found the machine's problem, and enthusiastically ran to the generator room to tell Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin about his discovery. Hua Ruibao gave him a sidelong glance and said: "The oil injection timing was specified by our factory's engineer, and it can't be wrong." Wang Hengcai didn't know why they were so indifferent, and his enthusiastic mood was doused with cold water.

After repeated consideration, he disassembled the machine again and re-examined it, proving that his discovery was correct. Then, he told the military personnel about his discovery, explained the reason why the machine broke down after less than three hours, and proposed a repair plan. They all supported his suggestion to improve the machine. With the support of the military personnel, Wang Hengcai's confidence was even higher. Without carefully considering the reason why Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin disagreed with improving the machine, he angrily said to Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin: "This machine injects oil too early and too much. To prevent the machine from breaking down, the oil injection timing must be delayed, and the oil head must be reduced from two thousand two hundred pounds to one thousand five hundred pounds. This is the only way to prevent the heat from damaging the cylinder and save oil." Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin saw that Wang Hengcai's attitude was not good, and said very forcefully: "The machine belongs to the boss, and the oil injection timing was specified by our factory's engineer; if you want to improve the machine, go to our boss, go to the engineer, we can't make the decision." After saying that, they left.

In the evening, a meeting was held in the generator room to discuss how to repair the generator, and Wang Hengcai put forward his own opinions. Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin struggled with their thoughts. Before Wang Hengcai discovered the machine's problem, they never thought of improving the machine at all. Now that Wang Hengcai had proposed a repair plan, from a technical point of view, it had a certain basis, but it also carried great risks. If the oil injection timing was delayed, and the machine blew up, who would be responsible? Hua Ruibao said: "When we came to Sanhe Sluice, the boss told us not to modify the machine casually. If you want to modify it now, you have to discuss it with the boss. We can't make the decision." Before Hua Ruibao finished speaking, Xu Xijin raised his hand to support him, saying: "I very much agree with Hua Ruibao's opinion."

At this time, Wang Hengcai realized why they were not enthusiastic about improving the machine. He thought: if this generator is not repaired, Sanhe Sluice cannot be built quickly, and the lives and property of millions of people on both sides of the lower reaches of the Huai River will not be guaranteed. We, the working class, should consider how to be responsible for the lives and property of millions of people. So, he said very excitedly: "We are the working class, and our food is given to us by the people. We should consider how to serve the people and be responsible to the people." Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin also said very excitedly: "You are advanced, you go and be responsible to the people. Anyway, without a letter from the boss, the machine cannot be modified." The two sides argued fiercely at the meeting, and it ended without a result in the middle of the night.

After the meeting, Wang Hengcai walked into the brigade headquarters with a very angry mood, and reported to the team leader that he had discovered the machine's problem and had a repair plan. The team leader was his old superior, and had worked with him at Gaoliangjian and Huaifubridge, and knew him very well. Seeing his excited face, the team leader smiled at him and said: "It's good that you discovered the machine's problem and proposed an improvement plan. But the task of the working class is not only to repair machines, but also to repair the backward thinking of individual workers. You didn't help Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin as enthusiastically as you repaired the machine, raising their class consciousness, but treated them with a rude attitude, which is wrong." After Wang Hengcai listened to the team leader's words, he calmed down.

The next morning, the team leader talked to Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin, first soliciting their opinions on Wang Hengcai's plan to improve the machine. The two of them said that they had no opinion, but they were afraid that the machine would be damaged and they wouldn't be able to take responsibility. The team leader said: "Since the organization agrees with Wang Hengcai's modification of the machine, you don't need to take responsibility." The team leader also convened everyone for another meeting to discuss how to repair the generator. At the meeting, Wang Hengcai explained his plan to improve the machine in great detail; and he reviewed himself for not having a good discussion with Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin after discovering the machine's problem, dispelling their ideological concerns, and repairing the machine together. The technical workers, engineers, and military personnel who attended the meeting all unanimously agreed with Wang Hengcai's plan to improve the machine and made some additions. Although Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin agreed to improve the machine, they were still doubtful about whether Wang Hengcai could repair the machine.

A vigorous "patriotic Huai River control labor competition" movement was launched on the Sanhe Sluice construction site. Each team and group, and everyone, made plans to improve labor efficiency, increase production and save money. Wang Hengcai mobilized the military personnel and workers in the generator room to guarantee the repair of the generator and compete with other generators.

On the morning of March 28th, it had just snowed, and the northwest wind was roaring, making the machine colder than ice. As soon as it was light, Wang Hengcai went to the generator room to disassemble, wash, wipe, and repair the machine, getting his whole body covered with cement slurry and grease. His hands were frozen numb, but he still kept working. The military personnel said: "Old Wang, it's too cold, go to the brazier and warm up before continuing!" Wang Hengcai said: "Okay, my body is cold, my hands are cold, but my heart for repairing the machine is very hot. If you don't believe me, touch it." This made everyone burst into laughter.

After a day of intense repairs, it wasn't even dark yet when the work shed was crowded with people, all coming to watch the test run. The result of the test was very good, it ran for more than ten hours without any problems, and it could burn one gallon less oil per hour.

Wang Hengcai looked at the electric lights on the construction site, the machine wheels turning, the dump trucks and flatcars speeding, the laborers running with soil, and the microphone singing. How happy he was! He patted Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin on the shoulders and said: "If I had paid attention to studying with you together from the beginning, maybe I could have repaired it one or two days earlier." Hua Ruibao and Xu Xijin were also moved and said with red faces: "If we two had been as responsible to the people and to the work as you were, we would have repaired the generator two months ago."

The team leader came. He looked at the machine happily and said: "Everyone, look at how great the power of our working class is. As long as we think of the people everywhere, are responsible to the people, and unite as one, there is no machine that cannot be repaired!" (Attached picture)

    电灯照亮了三河闸工地
    ——记工人王恒才修理发电机的经过
    潮流
    夜晚，三河闸工地是很紧张的。在密密层层的电灯下边，马达声震动着大地，几千辆斗车和平车，在纵横交错的铁道上飞驰。六万多民工挑着担子，像很多黑色的长龙在摆动。
    突然电灯灭了，机器停止了轰鸣，干得起劲的七万多民工、军工、工人、干部都停止了工作。有的埋怨，有的骂了起来：“真他娘的泄气，又是那部‘老爷’发电机跟我们捣蛋！”
    这部“老爷”发电机开不到三个钟头就要出一次毛病。它是上海一家私营工厂卖给三河闸工程指挥部的。合同上规定，试用期六个月；在试用期间，机器出大毛病，退还原主，不出大毛病，买卖就算成功。老板为了做成这笔买卖，不让机器在试用期间出毛病，派了两个技术工人——华瑞宝、徐锡金跟着机器；并嘱咐他们两个人，自己不在时，机子不能让别人开；机器有毛病要照原来的样子修理，不得随便修改；如果不照着他的话去做，弄坏了，他们俩要负责。这部发电机很老，很多零件不是原配。到了三河闸后，华瑞宝、徐锡金按照老板的话，头痛医头、脚痛医脚地修理了两个多月，没有从根本上改进机器。
    王恒才原来是车床工人，是个脾气很急躁的人。一九五一年十一月，他自动报名参加了治淮工作。他在建造淮阜桥工程中，积极找窍门，修好了一部抽水机，立过二等功。因他会修机器，到三河闸后，机械大队部就把他派到这部发电机的车间，协同华瑞宝、徐锡金进行修理。
    王恒才到了发电间，拆开机器仔细地检查了一遍，把一些小毛病都修理好了，就开始开动。但没开到三个钟头，就发现汽缸漏气，烟从回水管子里冒出来。
    停车后，王恒才好像看到七万多个工人、民工、干部，几十部机器站在他的面前，向他要电。等另一部发电机开起来，最快要半个钟头，大家才能恢复工作。王恒才计算了一下：七万人每天停止半个钟头工作，合起来是三万五千个钟头，一个人天天工作，要十二年才能补得上。一天浪费十二年，如果浪费十天，一辈子都补不上了。这对祖国建设的损失是多么大啊！想到这里，他的心比针刺还难受。
    这部发电机车间的工人、军工对修理好这部机器本来就没信心，见王恒才第一次没修好，他们更泄气了，都异口同声地说：“像这样的老爷机子，不应该摆在三河闸丢丑，早该让它进博物馆了。”这些话遭到王恒才的激烈反对，他说：“我们国家现在机器不多，坏机子应该当好机子用；修理坏机子是件困难事，但我们工人阶级应该拿出勇气来克服困难，不应该在困难面前垂头丧气。”
    刚学习技术，很多技术问题不大懂的军工，在他的鼓励下，信心比以前提高了。可是华瑞宝、徐锡金却不相信他的话。
    汽缸为什么开不到三个钟头就给烧坏了，烟为什么从水管里冒出来？王恒才恨不得立刻找出这是什么原因，想出修理办法，把机器修好，使工地上能通宵进行工作。他成天研究着机器的毛病，不到三天，他的脸上像涂了一层黄油，眼窝凹下去了，眼睛红肿得像熟了的杏子。
    王恒才累病了，头痛得像要炸裂，浑身烧得像着了火。有时站在机器旁边，迷迷糊糊地觉得工棚在头上旋转，大地在脚下翻滚，身子像站在小船上，驶进了波涛汹涌的大海。大队长知道他是个急性子，亲自到发电间要他休息休息。他自己也觉得太累了，很需要休息。但当他想起这部发电机是三河闸工程的心脏，它一停止跳动，整个工程就要受到影响，他就坚决不肯休息。他对大队长说：“发电机修不好，我的心就一天不让我休息。”
    有一天，发电机正在开动，王恒才老远就看见烟囱里冒出来的黑色浓烟，在工棚顶上缭绕。他想起一个钟头要烧七加仑油，比开得正常的机子要多烧一加仑，汽缸不到三个钟头就要烧坏，烟从水管里冒出来……。根据这一切情况判断，一定是油头进油过早过多，热气烧坏了汽缸床，同时柴油燃烧不清，所以烟囱里冒出了黑色的浓烟。
    他找到了机器的毛病，兴致勃勃地跑到发电间，把他的发现告诉华瑞宝和徐锡金。华瑞宝白了他一眼说：“进油时间是我们厂里工程师规定的，错不了。”王恒才不知他们的态度为什么这样冷淡，他火热的心情，被浇上了一盆冷水。
    经过反复的考虑，他又把机器拆开来从新检查了一遍，证明了他的发现是正确的。然后把他的发现告诉军工，说明机器开不到三个钟头就出毛病的原因，并提出了修理的办法。他们都拥护他改进机器的意见。王恒才有了军工的支持，信心更加提高了。他没有细心考虑华瑞宝、徐锡金不同意改进机器的原因，就气愤地对华瑞宝、徐锡金说：“这部机子进油太早太多，要机子不出毛病，必须把进油时间改迟，把油头由两千二百磅改小到一千五百磅，这样做才能使热气不冲坏气缸，并且节省了油。”华瑞宝和徐锡金看见王恒才态度不好，就也很强硬地说：“机子是老板的，进油时间是我们厂里工程师规定的；你要改进机子去找我们老板，找工程师，我们不能做主。”说完，他们就走了。
    晚上，发电间开了一个会，研究如何修好发电机，王恒才就提出了自己的意见。华瑞宝、徐锡金的思想展开了斗争。王恒才没发现机器的毛病前，他们根本没想到要改进机器。现在王恒才提出修理的办法，从技术上讲，是有一定根据的，但带有很大的危险性。如果把进油时间改迟，万一炸坏了机器，这责任谁负呢？华瑞宝说：“来三河闸时，老板叫我们不要随便改机器，你们现在要改，去和老板商量好了，我们作不了主。”华瑞宝的发言没落音，徐锡金就举手附议说：“我很同意华瑞宝的意见。”
    这时，王恒才才知道他们为什么对改进机器不热心。他想：这部发电机修不好，三河闸不能很快建造好，淮河下游两岸的千百万人民生命财产就没有保障。我们工人阶级应该考虑如何对千百万人民的生命财产负责。于是，他很激动地说：“我们是工人阶级，我们的饭是人民给我们吃的，我们应该考虑如何为人民服务，对人民负责。”华瑞宝、徐锡金也很激动地说：“你先进，你去对人民负责好了。反正没有老板的来信，机子不能改。”会上双方吵得很厉害，开到半夜没有结果。
    会后，王恒才带着很气愤的心情走进了大队部，向大队长汇报他发现了机器的毛病和修理的办法。大队长是他的老上级，在高良涧、淮阜桥就和他一起工作，对他很了解。大队长看到他激动的脸色，就对他笑着说：“你能发现机子有毛病，并提出了改进意见，这是好的。但工人阶级的任务，不光是修好机器，而且要修好个别工人的落后思想。你没有像修机器那样热心地来帮助华瑞宝和徐锡金，提高他们的阶级觉悟，而是用粗暴的态度来对待他们，这是不对的。”王恒才听完了大队长的话，心平气和了。
    第二天早晨，大队长找华瑞宝、徐锡金两人谈话，首先征求他们对王恒才改进机器的意见。两个人一边说没意见，一边说怕机器搞坏了，负不了责任。大队长说：“组织上既然同意王恒才改机子，责任用不着你们负。”大队长又召集大家开了一次会，研究如何修好发电机的问题。在会上，王恒才把他改进机器的意见，很详细地说了一遍；并检讨了自己发现了机器的毛病后，没有很好地和华瑞宝、徐锡金商量，解除他们的思想顾虑，共同把机器修好。到会的技术工人、工程师、军工都一致同意王恒才改进机器的办法，并作了一些补充。华瑞宝、徐锡金虽然同意改进机器，但对王恒才能否把机器修好，还是很怀疑。
    三河闸工地上开展了轰轰烈烈的“爱国治淮劳动竞赛”运动，各队各组，每个人都订了提高劳动效率，增产节约的计划。王恒才发动发电间的军工、工人保证修好发电机，和其他发电机竞赛。
    三月二十八日的早晨，天刚下过雪，西北风呼呼地怒吼着，机器冻得比冰块还凉。天一亮，王恒才就到发电间，把机器拆开来洗、擦、修，弄得满身是水泥浆和油腻，手冻得失去了知觉，还是不停地干。军工说：“老王，天太冷了，你到火盆上烤烤再干吧！”王恒才说：“行，身上冷，手冷，我修机器的心很热。不信，你们摸摸看。”说得大家哄堂大笑。
    经过一天紧张的修理，天还没有黑，工棚里就挤满了人，大家都来看试车。试验的结果非常好，开了十多个钟头没出毛病，每个钟头还可以少烧一加仑油。
    王恒才看着工地上的电灯，机轮在转动，斗车、平车在飞驰，民工挑着土飞跑着，麦克风在歌唱，他是多么高兴啊！他拍着华瑞宝、徐锡金的肩膀说：“如果我一开始注意和你们共同研究，也许能提早一两天修好。”华瑞宝、徐锡金也感动得红着脸说：“我们两人如果像你这样对人民负责，对工作负责，两个月前就把发电机修好了。”
    大队长来了。他看着机器高兴地说：“大家看看，我们工人阶级的力量多伟大。只要我们处处为人民着想，对人民负责，团结一致，就没有修不好的机器！”（附图片）
