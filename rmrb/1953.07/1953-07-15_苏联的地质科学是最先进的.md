    Soviet geological science is the most advanced.
    Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union, Zhang Wenyou
    Soviet geological science grew out of Russian geological science. It inherited the excellent traditions of famous geologists such as Karpinsky, Fedorov, Vernadsky, and Fersman. After the October Socialist Revolution, it received extremely favorable development conditions under the direct care of Lenin and Stalin and the strong support of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. Stalin's Five-Year Plans and the urgent requirements of industry further promoted its development. Now, Soviet geological science has become the most advanced geological science in the world.
    Soviet geological science is fundamentally different from geological science in capitalist countries. It has grown in the process of serving the people, and its purpose is to maximize and most effectively utilize Soviet underground resources to meet the growing needs of the national economy. Soviet geologists are now accelerating the production of a unified stratigraphic table for the entire Soviet Union as a basis for geotectonic and geological history research to help mineral prospecting and exploration. Soviet geotectonic research provides a scientific basis for mineral prospecting and the selection of sites for great communist construction projects. According to the seismic distribution map of the entire Soviet Union, Soviet scholars are conducting small-area seismic and new geotectonic research in seismically active areas as the basis for earthquake forecasting and anti-seismic building design. Due to the improvement and widespread application of physical prospecting methods, more metal and non-metal deposits have been discovered in the Soviet Union. New achievements in mineralogy and petrology have greatly benefited the prospecting and exploration of useful minerals. Before the revolution, the Soviet Union lacked aluminum and tin, and copper, lead, and zinc were also scarce. The situation has changed greatly now. Geologists have explored many mineral deposits based on metallogenic laws. In order to cooperate with Stalin's plan to transform nature, hydrogeological and engineering geological research work has been widely developed in the Soviet Union. Brilliant achievements have been made in the research of groundwater, soil science, rock mechanics, soil mechanics, permafrost, loess, and Quaternary geology, which are closely related to them, and they have surpassed capitalist countries. In addition to serving mineral prospecting and exploration, Soviet petrological research also studies the properties of rocks and seeks good building materials. For example, artificially modifying the properties of rocks to strengthen the foundation of projects and manufacture new rocks, such as basalt and dolomite, can be melted to make various building materials; factories are now producing this material in large quantities and promoting it widely. Geochemistry, which studies the migration, distribution, accumulation, and evolution laws of chemical elements inside the earth, is a science specially developed in the Soviet Union. Soviet scholars believe that minerals are a "station" in the process of chemical elements moving inside the earth, so they have new views on the classification of minerals. Using trace gases and trace elements in the soil to detect petroleum and metal deposits, using different ratios of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in mineral water to identify the origin of mineral deposits, and using the ratio of radioactive potassium isotopes and argon isotopes in rocks to identify the absolute age of geology have all achieved good results. In addition, the study of the circulation of chemical elements within the earth can also expand the study of the circulation of chemical elements in the universe, thus giving rise to a new science—cosmochemistry. This overthrows the bourgeois idealist world view of Schmidt's theory of cosmic evolution, not only giving us a correct understanding of the formation of the earth, but also pointing out new directions for geotectonics and the study of igneous rocks.
    Soviet geological science work is strictly planned. Stalin's Five-Year Plans promoted Soviet science to embark on the road of planning. The geological research work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the geological research work of higher education institutions, and the geological survey and exploration work of industrial departments are carried out under a unified plan. The geological mineral exploration teams of industrial departments often have geological staff from the Academy of Sciences and higher education institutions participate, and industrial departments often sign contracts with the Academy of Sciences or higher education institutions to jointly complete certain work. In addition, researchers from the Academy of Sciences and professors from higher education institutions often hold concurrent posts. For example, the professors of the Department of Geology of the Central Asian University of Tashkent in Uzbekistan are mostly researchers from the Institute of Geological Sciences of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences, and the research work of the department is also carried out in the Geological Institute. On the other hand, in order to comprehensively, systematically, and comprehensively solve a certain problem, not only the research work of various sciences within geological science, such as stratigraphy, geotectonics, petrology, and mineral deposits, cooperate with each other, but also organically connect with physics, chemistry, and so on. There are a large number of physics and chemistry research staff in the Geological Science Research Institute, and the oldest spectral analysis laboratory in the Soviet Union is located in the Institute. For example, petroleum is widely studied in the Soviet Union. Not only does the Ministry of Petroleum Industry have its own research institute, but the Soviet Academy of Sciences also has the same research institute; in the Petroleum Research Institute, petroleum is studied comprehensively, systematically, and comprehensively, from petroleum geology, exploitation, processing, and utilization, all the way to the physical and chemical properties of petroleum.
    Soviet geological science is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, and every researcher takes dialectical materialism as his weapon. Therefore, they can inherit the excellent traditions of Russian geological science and analyze and criticize the achievements of the world's history and modern countries in geological science, discarding the dross and taking the essence. For example, in mineralogy, geologists criticized the one-sidedness of Western European and American mineralogy theories, and replaced Emmons's zonal theory of single mineralization in the United States with Smirnov's pulsating theory of multiple mineralization. Bowen in the United States believes that various igneous rocks are differentiated from basic magma. Therefore, some bourgeois mineral deposit scholars also followed and excessively emphasized the influence of magma composition on mineralization, while ignoring the influence of external conditions on mineralization. Soviet scholars criticized this theory with the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, thus establishing the theory of the influence of wall rock assimilation and environmental conditions such as structure, time, depth, temperature, and pressure on mineralization. Because Marxism-Leninism was used in mineral deposit science, the mineral deposit laws discovered by Soviet scholars have been very successful in practice, expanding the Soviet Union's mineral resources such as tin, aluminum, manganese, chromium, and copper. Academician Nalivkin, an old Soviet geologist, once told us that all geological phenomena are interconnected, and they are constantly developing in the process of contradiction and unity. To study sedimentation, we must study erosion, and to study the continent, we must study the ocean. Only by looking at problems from the perspective of the connection between things can we discover more problems, understand problems more deeply, and thus solve problems better. The study of the equilibrium state of silicate and water under high temperature and high pressure conditions can not only help us understand the changes inside the earth's crust, but also help us solve the corrosion problem of steam turbine blades in industry.
    In order to ensure that the newborn and developing things are better developed, in order to enable scientists to fully develop their talents and wisdom, in order to continuously improve Soviet science, the Soviet scientific community is widely launching debates and criticisms of different opinions, because creative discussions, debates of different opinions, criticism and self-criticism are huge forces driving the development of Soviet science. In the Soviet Union, the publication of every work must solicit the opinions of experts and go through repeated discussions in advance. The Soviet Academy of Sciences often convenes discussions on various disciplines. At the meeting, experts from scientific research institutions all over the Soviet Union can freely express their opinions on the existing problems in the discussed disciplines and start debates and criticisms. In terms of geological science, there are many such discussions. Last year, a "Sedimentary Rock" discussion was held. This year, in April, a "Magmatism Related to Mineral Deposits" discussion was held. This fall, a "Mineralogy" discussion will be convened, and next spring, a "Geotectonics" discussion will be convened. At the "Magmatism Related to Mineral Deposits" discussion, we personally witnessed the heated debates and sincere and frank mutual criticism of Soviet scholars. The sharp and correct criticism of young scientists was calmly accepted by the old academicians; the disputes on the field did not affect the feelings after the meeting. This is just as Soviet scientists said, criticism is help, and self-criticism is virtue. Criticism and self-criticism can not only improve the understanding of scientific research workers, but also find the correct direction of scientific research work. For example, although the Soviet mineral deposit classification problem has not yet been resolved, after discussion, everyone has a common understanding of the problem, that is: the purpose of mineral deposit classification is to facilitate mineral exploration. Therefore, mineral deposit classification must proceed from reality, comprehensively consider the problem, and not only one-sidedly consider the influence of the magma itself and temperature like Western European and American mineral deposit scholars, but also consider all geological conditions, such as wall rock, depth, pressure, ore fluid concentration, and the relationship with igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks.

    苏联的地质科学是最先进的
    中国科学院访苏代表团团员  张文佑
    苏联的地质科学是在俄罗斯地质科学的基础上生长起来的，它继承了卡尔宾斯基、弗德洛夫、维那德斯基、费尔士曼等有名地质学家的优良传统。十月社会主义革命后，它在列宁、斯大林的直接关怀和苏联共产党、苏联政府的大力支持下得到极有利的发展条件，斯大林五年计划和工业的迫切要求，更促进了它的发展。现在，苏联的地质科学已成为世界上最先进的地质科学了。
    苏联的地质科学和资本主义国家的地质科学有着根本的不同，它是在服务于人民的过程中成长起来的，它以最大限度地、最有效地利用苏联地下资源，满足国民经济日益增长的需要为目的。苏联地质学者现正在加速进行制作全苏统一的地层表，作为大地构造及地质史研究的根据，以帮助矿产的普查和勘探。苏联地质构造的研究为矿产普查和伟大共产主义建设工程地点的选定，提供了科学的根据。苏联学者根据全苏地震分布图，在地震频繁地区进行小区域地震及新地质构造的研究，作为地震预告及抗御地震建筑设计的基础。由于物理探矿方法的改良和普遍的应用，在苏联发现了更多的金属及非金属矿床。矿床学及岩石学方面的新成就，使有用矿物的普查及勘探得到很大的收获。苏联在革命前缺乏铝和锡，铜、铅、锌也很少，现在的情况已大大改变了。地质学家们根据成矿规律探得了许多的矿床。为了配合斯大林改造大自然的计划，水文地质和工程地质的研究工作在苏联广泛地发展着，在地下水、土质学、岩石力学、土壤力学、冻土、黄土以及和它们有密切关系的第四纪地质等方面的研究都有光辉的成就，并且超过了资本主义国家。苏联岩石学的研究除服务于矿产的普查和勘探之外，还研究岩石的性能，寻找良好的建筑材料。例如，以人工改造岩石的性质，加固工程的基础，并制造新的岩石，如玄武岩加白云岩经熔化后即可制出各种建筑器材；现在工厂正在大量制造这种材料，并普遍推广。研究化学元素在地球内部迁移、分布、聚集及演化规律的地质化学是苏联特殊发展的科学。苏联学者认为，矿物是化学元素在地球内部运动过程中的一个“站”，因而对矿物的分类有了新的看法。用土壤中的微量气体和微量元素来探测石油和金属矿床，用氢和氧同位素在矿物含水中的不同比例来鉴定矿床的成因，以及用放射性钾同位素和氩同位素在岩石中的比例来鉴定地质绝对年龄等方面都有良好的成就。另外，化学元素在地球内运转的研究，还可扩大研究化学元素在宇宙范围内的循环，因而产生了一门新科学——宇宙化学。这就推翻了资产阶级唯心世界观的斯密特宇宙演化论，不仅使我们对于地球的形成有了正确的看法，而且给大地构造学和火成岩的研究指出了新的方向。
    苏联地质科学工作是有严密的计划性的。斯大林的五年计划推动苏联科学走上了计划的道路。苏联科学院的地质研究工作、高等学校的地质研究工作和产业部门的地质调查、勘探工作是在统一计划下进行的。产业部门的地质矿产探测队常常有科学院和高等学校的地质工作人员参加，而且产业部门也常常和科学院或高等学校订立合同，共同完成一定的工作。此外，科学院的研究人员和高等学校的教授还常常兼职，例如乌兹别克塔什干中亚细亚大学的地质系教授多由乌兹别克科学院地质科学研究所的研究人员兼任，而且该系的研究工作也就在地质所内进行。在另一方面，为了全面地、系统地、综合地解决某一项问题，不仅地质科学内的各门科学，如地层、大地构造、岩石、矿床等等的研究工作互相合作，并且和物理、化学等有机地联系起来。地质科学研究所内有大量的物理和化学研究工作人员，苏联最老的光谱分析室就设在该所。又如，石油在苏联被广泛地研究着，不仅石油工业部有自己的研究所，苏联科学院也有同样的研究所；在石油研究所内，石油被全面地、系统地、综合地研究着，从石油地质、开采、加工和利用，一直研究到石油的物理和化学性质。
    苏联的地质科学是建筑在马克思列宁主义基础上的，每一个研究人员都把辩证唯物主义作为自己的武器。因此他们能够继承俄罗斯地质科学的优良传统，并对世界历史上和现代各国在地质科学方面的成就作了分析批判，去其糟粕，取其精华。例如在矿床学方面，地质科学家们批判了西欧、美国矿床学说的片面性，以斯米尔诺夫的多次成矿的脉动学说代替了美国爱曼斯的一次成矿的分带学说。美国鲍文认为，各种火成岩石是由基性岩浆分化而来，因而一些资产阶级的矿床学家也跟着过分地强调了岩浆成分对于成矿的影响，而忽视了外围条件对于成矿的影响。苏联学者用辩证唯物主义的观点，批判了这种学说，从而建立了围岩同化以及构造、时间、深度、温度、压力等环境条件对于成矿影响的学说。由于在矿床学中运用了马克思列宁主义，苏联学者所发现的矿床规律在实践中得到了很大的成功，扩大了苏联的锡、铝、锰、铬、铜等矿产资源。苏联的老地质学家那立夫金院士曾告诉我们，一切地质现象都是互相联系着的，它们在矛盾和统一过程中不断发展着。要研究沉积就必须研究侵蚀，要研究大陆就必须研究海洋。只有从事物和事物之间的联系上看问题，才能发现更多的问题，更深刻地了解问题，因而也能更好地解决问题。矽酸盐和水在高温、高压条件下的平衡状态的研究，不但可以帮助我们了解地壳内部的变化，而且可以帮助我们解决工业上蒸汽涡轮叶片的腐蚀问题。
    为了保证新生的、正在发展着的东西得到更好的发展，为了使科学家充分地发展他们的才能和智慧，为了使苏联科学不断提高，苏联科学界广泛地展开着不同意见的争论和批评，因为创造性的讨论、不同意见的争论、批评和自我批评是推动苏联科学发展的巨大力量。在苏联，每一著作的出版，事前都要征求各专家的意见，经过反复讨论。苏联科学院时常召集各种学科的讨论会。在会上来自苏联各地科学研究机构的专家，对所讨论的学科中存在的问题，可自由发表意见，展开争论和批评。在地质科学方面，这种讨论会是很多的，去年曾经举行过“沉积岩”讨论会，今年四月间又举行了“和矿床联系的岩浆作用”讨论会，今年秋季将要召集“矿物学”讨论会，明年春季还要召集“大地构造”讨论会。在“和矿床联系的岩浆作用”讨论会上，我们曾亲眼看到苏联学者们的热烈争论和诚恳坦率的相互批评。青年科学家的尖锐而正确的批评，老院士安然受之；会场上的争论并不影响会后的感情。这正如苏联科学家所说，批评是帮助，自我批评是美德。批评和自我批评不仅可以提高科学研究工作者的认识，而且还可以找出科学研究工作的正确方向。例如，苏联矿床分类问题现在虽尚未解决，但经过讨论，大家对这个问题有了共同的认识，那就是：矿床分类的目的在于便利找矿，因此矿床分类就必须从实际出发，全面地考虑问题，不能像西欧和美国矿床学家那样只是片面地考虑岩浆本身成分和温度的影响，而且还必须考虑到所有的地质条件，如围岩、深度、压力、矿液浓度以及和火成岩及水成岩关系等问题。
