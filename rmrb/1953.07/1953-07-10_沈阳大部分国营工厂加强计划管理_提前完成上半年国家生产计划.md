Shenyang: Most State-Owned Factories Strengthen Planned Management and Complete the First Half of the Year's National Production Plan Ahead of Schedule

[This newspaper dispatch] Since April, more than 30 state-owned factories in Shenyang City, spanning machinery, electrical engineering, chemical industry, metallurgy, and heavy industry, have strengthened planned management based on discussions of the national production plan. The light industry system has also implemented technical management, leading to improvements in production. By the end of June, 22 major state-owned factories had completed the first half of 1953 national production plan in terms of both total production value and total commodity value ahead of schedule.

Since Shenyang's state-owned factories strengthened planned management in April, they have gradually moved towards balanced production in an orderly manner, with some factories achieving remarkable results. Factories such as Factory 53, Factory 54, the Smelting Plant, Machinery Factory 12, and Machinery Factory 26 were basically able to produce according to the progress plan in June. Among them, the Smelting Plant was even able to complete the production plan according to the daily progress. By the end of June, the 22 major state-owned factories that had completed the first half of the year's production plan ahead of schedule included Machinery Factory 1, Machinery Factory 2, Machinery Factory 3, Machinery Factory 4, Machinery Factory 6, Machinery Factory 8, Machinery Factory 19, Machinery Factory 25, Machinery Factory 26, the Smelting Plant, Electrical Engineering Factory 5, Factory 52, Factory 53, Factory 54, and the Mining Machinery Factory. Nine units, including Machinery Factory 5, the Railway Factory, and the Bridge Factory, only failed to complete the plan for individual products. However, eight units, including Factory 51, Machinery Factory 7, Machinery Factory 23, Electrical Engineering Factory 7, Electrical Engineering Factory 14, and Electrical Engineering Factory 25, failed to complete the plan.

With the exception of the light industry system, most state-owned factories in Shenyang have gained some preliminary experience in strengthening planned management. Generally speaking, all state-owned factories in the city have proceeded from the specific conditions of their own factories and combined this with doing a good job in production to strengthen planned management. Many cadres recognize that strengthening planned management and improving enterprise management levels are key to promoting production. Some units have also gradually corrected the tendency for planned management work to be detached from or not closely integrated with production. Most units have carried out this work in a planned and step-by-step manner. Generally, they have adopted methods such as studying documents from top to bottom, conducting investigation and research, taking stock, training key personnel, and conducting pilot projects to grasp the status quo of enterprise management, improve and compile work plans, break through key issues, and seek consolidation from an organizational point of view. Universal attention has been paid to improving and strengthening departmental work. As a result, cadres in some factories clearly understand what should be done to strengthen planned management and how to do it. For example, Factory 53, the Smelting Plant, and Machinery Factory 1, thanks to the clear understanding of the leading cadres, being clear about the situation, and accurately, practically, and systematically mobilizing the masses, rectifying and improving work plans, finding many tricks, and proposing many rationalization proposals, the key problems have been solved. At present, planned management is being consolidated from the system and organization, and advanced experience is being vigorously promoted, work plans are being implemented, so that production efficiency is continuously and balancedly improved. The technical management work of the light industry system has also made progress, and the product quality of some factories has also been initially improved. Units such as Rubber Factory 3, Rubber Factory 5, and Rubber Factory 7 have also gained preliminary experience in the trial production of new products. However, the progress of the above-mentioned work is still uneven and slow. Some factory cadres do not pay enough attention to the work of strengthening planned management, and have not seriously studied the instructions of higher authorities, expert reports, and the experience of fraternal factories. The chaotic and unbalanced production situation in these state-owned factories has not been reversed, resulting in the failure to complete the national production plan.

In order to mobilize all employees of state-owned factories to continue to strengthen planned management, and in the light industry system, to continue to strengthen technical management, improve product quality, and carry out trial production of new products around production tasks, in order to comprehensively and balancedly complete the national plan, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a joint meeting of the main responsible cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of state-owned factories throughout the city on July 2 to discuss and determine the specific steps and methods for future work. The meeting required all factories to grasp the central link of enterprise management, and carry out this work accurately, practically, and meticulously to the end, in order to thoroughly improve and improve the management level of enterprises.

    沈阳大部分国营工厂加强计划管理
    提前完成上半年国家生产计划
    【本报讯】两个月来，沈阳市先后有机械、电工、化工、冶炼、重工业等系统的三十多个国营工厂，在讨论国家生产计划的基础上，进行了加强计划管理工作，轻工业系统也进行了技术管理工作，使生产情况有了好转，到六月底，有二十二个主要国营工厂在生产总值和商品总值方面，都提前完成了一九五三年上半年国家生产计划。
    沈阳市国营工厂从四月份加强计划管理以来，逐渐有秩序地走向均衡生产，有些工厂收到显著成绩。如五三厂、五四厂、冶炼厂、机械十二厂、机械二十六厂等单位，六月份基本上都能按进度计划进行生产。其中冶炼厂更能按日进度完成生产计划。到六月底，提前完成上半年生产计划的有机械
    一厂、机械二厂、机械三厂、机械四厂、机械六厂、机械八厂、机械十九厂、机械二十五厂、机械二十六厂、冶炼厂、电工五厂、五二厂、五三厂、五四厂、矿山机械厂等二十二个主要国营工厂。机械五厂、铁路工厂、桥梁工厂等九个单位，只有个别产品未完成计划。但也有五一厂、机械七厂、机械二十三厂、电工七厂、电工十四厂、电工二十五厂等八个单位没有完成计划。
    除轻工业系统外，沈阳市多数国营工厂在加强计划管理工作中都摸到了一些初步经验。全市各国营工厂一般地都是从本厂具体情况出发，结合搞好生产进行加强计划管理工作的。许多干部认识到加强计划管理、提高企业管理水平是推动生产前进的关键。有些单位也逐渐纠正了计划管理工作脱离或与生产结合不紧的偏向。多数单位都有计划、有步骤地进行了这一工作。一般都采取自上而下学文件、调查研究、摸底、培养骨干、典型试办等方法，掌握企业管理现状，改善与编制作业计划，突破关键，并从组织上求得巩固；普遍注意了改善与加强科室工作。因此，有些厂的干部明确认识到加强计划管理应该做些什么和怎样做。如五三厂、冶炼厂、机械一厂等，由于领导干部认识明确，心中有数，准确、切实、有步骤地通过发动群众，整顿、改善了作业计划，找出许多窍门，提出许多合理化建议，关键问题得到解决。目前正在从制度、组织上巩固计划管理，并大力推广先进经验，贯彻执行作业计划，使生产效率不断地、均衡地提高。轻工业系统的技术管理工作也有进展，有的工厂的产品质量也得到初步改进，橡胶三厂、橡胶五厂、橡胶七厂等单位在新产品试制工作上也取得了初步经验。但上述工作的进展还不平衡，进度迟缓，有一些工厂的干部对加强计划管理工作还不够重视，对上级指示、专家报告、兄弟厂的经验还没有认真研究。这类国营工厂中的生产混乱、生产不均衡的局面并未得到扭转，以致完不成国家生产计划。
    中共沈阳市委为了动员各国营工厂全体职工继续加强计划管理；在轻工业系统则为继续加强技术管理工作，提高产品质量，围绕生产任务进行新产品试制工作，以全面地均衡地完成国家计划，七月二日曾召开全市各国营工厂党、行政、工会、青年团主要负责干部的联席会议，讨论并确定今后工作的具体步骤和方法。会议要求各厂抓住企业管理的中心环节，准确、切实、细致地把这一工作进行到底，以便彻底改善与提高企业的管理水平。
