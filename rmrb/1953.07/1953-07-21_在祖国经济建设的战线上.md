    On the Battlefront of National Economic Construction
    Lhasa Public Construction Projects Underway
    Lhasa's various public construction projects are being accelerated. The new type of veterinary serum factory being built on the large meadow in the northern suburbs of the city has already completed more than 90 rooms including the rinderpest serum production room, cattle sheds, work laboratory and staff dormitory. Other anthrax serum production rooms, etc., will also be completed by the end of this year. At the construction site of the Cadre School of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Zhongji Linka on the banks of the Lhasa River, neat rows of houses have been built. The construction of classrooms, offices, dormitories, and infirmaries has been basically completed. Other construction projects such as farms and cadre sanatoriums are also being accelerated in the scenic western suburbs of Lhasa.
    The Tibetan local government and people from all walks of life in Tibet actively support the construction of these public buildings. The Tibetan local government donated the foundation and helped purchase and transport building materials; thousands of Tibetan and Han workers and technical personnel are working hard for the completion of these projects.

    Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine Produces While Building
    Since the newly built Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine started production, the enthusiasm of the workers for labor competition has been very high. From July 1st to 8th, the national production plan for these eight days was overfulfilled by 8.7%. New construction projects are also being accelerated. The new construction projects mainly include automation and welfare facilities. These include ultra-shortwave control telephones for transportation, wired broadcasters dedicated to production scheduling, signals, automated track-switching equipment, and a comprehensive joint building for concentrating on the distribution of production tasks when going to work and washing and changing clothes after work, as well as the greening of the entire open-pit mine. In addition, production machinery will also be greatly increased. Eighty-ton electric locomotives will be replaced with 160-ton ones. In addition to general electric shovels and rock drills, a walking-type large electric shovel that digs 14 cubic meters in one scoop will also be added. A large substation for the entire mine will also be under construction soon. After the completion of these projects, the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine will become a fully automated labor garden with green trees and green grass, and will ensure that the designed annual output is reached in 1955.
    Huaxin Cement Company Calcining Section Creates New Record
    On May 31, No. 1 cement kiln of the calcining section of Huaxin Cement Company operated safely for 24 hours and exceeded the nominal capacity by 25.1% (previously 21.64%), setting the highest single-kiln output record in the country. On June 7, the output of the double kiln exceeded the nominal capacity by 19.8% (previously 18.2%), setting the highest double-kiln daily output record in the country, and the quality met the standards.
    The main reason for their achievements is that they further increased the chain of No. 2 kiln on the basis of implementing the Soviet long-flame full-air rapid operation method. During the major overhaul, the chains were replaced, which kept the incoming materials in the kiln normal, increased the number of fast cars, reduced the number of slow cars, and increased the output. In addition, due to the organization of a mechanical inspection team and the establishment of a mechanical maintenance responsibility system, mechanical failures were reduced. At the same time, the batching section also used Soviet experience to strictly control the composition of the materials entering the kiln, and the results of chemical analysis were told to the calcining workers every shift every day, closely cooperating, so the standard of the composition was maintained, and the output of clinker could be evenly achieved to the daily production plan.
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Ferrous Metallurgical Design Company Achieves Results in Competition
    The Ferrous Metallurgical Design Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched a competition to welcome the "July 1st" Party's birthday. Strive to overfulfill the June plan by 105% on the basis of ensuring design quality. At the end of June, the company fully completed the plan, of which the Instrument Section overfulfilled by 119.6%, and two sections exceeded the plan by 40%. The company as a whole averaged 117.7% overfulfillment of the plan.
    Guangdong Farmers Achieve Great Results in Drought Prevention and Resistance
    Farmers in Guangdong Province actively prevented and resisted drought, ensuring the harvest of early rice and the growth of late rice seedlings, and achieved results. In the past month, rainfall in Guangdong Province has been low, and drought has occurred in some areas, affecting the flowering and grain filling of early rice and the growth of late rice seedlings. Farmers in drought-stricken areas quickly launched drought prevention and resistance work. Farmers in Yangshan County have rushed to repair 258 large and small water conservancy projects, irrigating more than 80,000 catties of rice seedlings and most of the drought-stricken paddy fields. Farmers in Meihua Township, Lechang County, built 45 water conservancy projects to solve the water shortage problem for more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields; farmers in Lingkou Township cut grass and soaked it in the paddy fields to keep the soil moist and enhance drought resistance. Farmers in Xiajing Township, Zengcheng County, organized 112 waterwheels to draw water, saving all the drought-stricken seedlings. Male and female farmers in Tangtou Township, Qingyuan County, went out early and late to carry water to irrigate seedlings. Now, the threat of drought in paddy fields in various places has been basically eliminated. In order to ensure the completion of the early rice harvest and strive for a bumper harvest of late rice, the South China Branch of the CPC Central Committee has notified party committees at all levels in Guangdong Province, pointing out that it is currently necessary to continue to eliminate the paralysis of cadres and the masses, concentrate on the experience of farmers in drought prevention and resistance, and thoroughly carry out drought prevention and resistance work.

    Various Crops Grow Well on the Kangzang Plateau
    Various crops grow well on the Kangzang Plateau, and a bumper harvest is expected this autumn.
    Along the Yarlung Zangbo River and Nianchu River basin, one of the main agricultural areas in Tibet, highland barley and wheat are already five or six inches high, and peas and rape are flowering and bearing fruit; buckwheat and other crops are also growing vigorously. In the fields along the Lhasa River, which stretches for hundreds of miles, wheat waves are surging, and the early-planted highland barley and wheat are heading and flowering. Highland barley and round roots planted in Dingqing, a cold and high-altitude area 3,800 meters above sea level, are also growing well. In the warm and rainy Bomi area in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, highland barley and wheat have been harvested. In some mountainous areas of the Himalayas, this year's highland barley has yielded an average of more than 200 catties per mu.
    Now, on the Lhasa Plain and along the Yarlung Zangbo River, farmers are working hard in the fields to weed and irrigate. This year, farmers have been more careful in farming than in previous years, and most of the land has been weeded once and irrigated several times. This spring, the People's Liberation Army issued a water conservancy loan in Xigaze and built a large canal more than 20 miles long in the suburbs of the city, irrigating more than 10,000 mu of land. Many lands that were barren in the past due to lack of water are now growing thriving crops. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Northwest Soil and Water Conservation Inspection Group Completes Work
    The Northwest Soil and Water Conservation Inspection Group, jointly organized by the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry and relevant departments of various places of the Central People's Government, has completed its work in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, and set off from Xi'an on the 16th to return to Beijing. After arriving in the Northwest region on May 6, the inspection group successively inspected the soil erosion situation in the Jinghe, Weihe, Luohe, and Wuding River basins, the main tributaries of the Yellow River in northern Shaanxi Province and eastern, southern Gansu Province, and Lanzhou. They collected relevant data on soil, climate, hydrology, and ground cover, and learned about the experience of local farmers in maintaining soil and water. The inspection group also held forums with local leading organs to exchange views on soil and water conservation work. Zhang Hanying, head of the inspection group, made a report on "Northwest Soil and Water Conservation Work and Yellow River Governance Issues" to cadres in the Northwest Region, Shaanxi Province, and Xi'an City during his stay in Xi'an. According to the materials obtained from the inspection, the inspection group believes that the coverage on the ancient Northwest Loess Plateau was a forest and grassland zone. However, due to the feudal land system in the past, unreasonable land use and serious soil erosion have been caused. Although the rainfall in the Northwest region is currently insufficient, the essence of the local loess is good, containing a large amount of phosphorus, potassium and other elements needed by plants; in the future, as long as a reasonable farming system is implemented and soil and water conservation work is vigorously promoted, high yields can still be obtained. The specific content of soil and water conservation work in the Northwest region is: protect the source (water does not leave the plateau), consolidate the gully (mud does not leave the gully), protect the slope (soil does not leave the slope) and prevent sand (sand does not move south), etc. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    拉萨市公共建筑工程加紧施工
    拉萨市各种公共建筑工程正在加紧施工。在市区北郊的大草坪上修建的新型兽疫血清制造厂，现在已经盖好了牛瘟血清制造室、牛棚、工作试验室和工作人员宿舍等九十多间房屋，其他炭疽血清制造室等也将在今年底完工。在拉萨河畔仲机林卡中国人民解放军西藏军区干部学校的工地上，已经修好了一排排整齐的房屋。教室、办公室、宿舍、医务所等工程已基本完成。其他如农场、干部休养所等修建工程，也正在风景幽美的拉萨西郊加紧进行。
    西藏地方政府和西藏各阶层人民，都积极支援这些公共建筑物的修建。西藏地方政府捐送地基，帮助购买和运输建筑材料；成千的藏族、汉族工人和技术工作人员，都正在为这些工程的完成而紧张地工作着。（新华社）
    海州露天煤矿一面生产一面建设
    新建的阜新海州露天煤矿开始生产后，职工们劳动竞赛热潮非常高涨。从七月一日到八日，超额百分之八点七完成了这八天的国家生产计划。新的建设工程也在加速进行。新的建设工程主要是自动化和福利设施工程。其中包括运输方面的超短波控制电话、专管生产调度的有线广播器、信号、搬道自动化设备，和上班时集中分配生产任务、下班后盥洗换装等无所不备的联合大楼和全露天矿的绿化工作等。另外，生产机械也要大大增加，八十吨重的电机车将换为一百六十吨的，除一般电铲、穿孔机外，还要增加一勺就挖十四立方公尺的迈步式大电铲。供全矿用的大变电站也即将施工。这些工程完成后，海州露天矿将成为一座完全自动化的绿树成荫、碧草如茵的劳动花园，并保证在一九五五年达到设计年产量。
    华新水泥公司锻烧工段创新纪录
    华新水泥公司锻烧工段一号水泥窑五月三十一日安全运转二十四小时，并超过公称能力百分之二十五点一（以前是百分之二十一点六四），创全国单窑产量最高纪录。六月七日，双窑超过公称能力百分之十九点八（以前是百分之十八点二），创全国双窑日产量最高纪录，质量都合乎标准。
    他们能取得这样成绩，主要原因是在实行苏联长火焰全风快速运转法的基础上，进一步增加二号窑的链条。在大检修时，又改挂了链条，这样使窑内保持了来料的正常，快车加多，慢车减少，增加了产量。此外，由于组织了机械检查组，建立了机械检修责任制，减少了机械故障。同时配料工段也运用了苏联的经验，严格控制了入窑成份，每天每班把化学分析的结果，随时告诉锻烧的工人、密切配合，所以保持了成份的标准，熟料产量便能均衡地达到逐日生产的计划。
    鞍钢黑色冶金设计公司竞赛有成绩
    鞍山钢铁公司黑色冶金设计公司，为迎接“七一”党的生日开展了竞赛。争取在保证设计质量的基础上，超额完成六月份计划的百分之一百零五。六月末，该公司全面完成了计划，其中计器科超额完成百分之一百一十九点六，有两个科超过计划百分之四十。全公司平均超额完成计划百分之一百一十七点七强。
    广东省农民防旱抗旱效果很大
    广东省农民积极防旱抗旱，保障早稻的收成和晚稻秧苗的生长，取得了成绩。近一个月来，广东省雨量较少，部分地区发生旱象，影响了早稻的开花结实和晚稻秧苗的生长。各受旱地区农民迅速展开了防旱抗旱工作。阳山县农民已抢修大小水利工程二百五十八处，灌溉了八万多斤谷种的秧田和大部分受旱稻田。乐昌县梅花乡农民修了水利工程四十五处，解决了一千多亩稻田缺水的问题；灵口乡农民割草浸在稻田里，使田泥保持湿润，增强抗旱能力。增城县下境乡农民组织了一百一十二架水车车水，挽救了全部受旱秧田。清远县塘头乡男女农民早晚出动担水淋秧。现在，各地稻田干旱威胁已基本消除。为了保证早稻完成收割和争取晚稻丰收，中共中央华南分局已通报广东省各地各级党委，指出当前必须继续消除干部、群众的麻痹思想，集中农民防旱抗旱的经验，彻底做好防旱抗旱工作。

    康藏高原上各种作物生长良好
    康藏高原上各种作物生长良好，今秋丰收有望。
    在西藏主要农业区之一的雅鲁藏布江和年楚河流域沿岸，青稞、小麦已有五、六寸高，豌豆、油菜正在开花结实；荞麦等作物也生长得茁壮挺秀。在长达数百华里的拉萨河两岸的田野里，麦浪滔滔，下种较早的青稞、小麦正在抽穗开花。种植在丁青一带拔海三千八百公尺高寒地带的青稞、圆根也长得很好。在温暖多雨的雅鲁藏布江下游波密地区的青稞、小麦已经收割完毕。喜马拉雅山部分山区，今年青稞每亩平均得到二百多斤的丰收。
    现在，拉萨平原和雅鲁藏布江沿岸，农民们正在田地里紧张地进行除草、灌水工作。今年农民在耕作上已比往年细致，大部分的土地都拔过一次草和灌了几次水。今年春天，人民解放军在日喀则发放了一次水利贷款，在市郊修筑了一条二十多里长的大水渠，使一万多亩土地得到灌溉，许多过去因缺水荒芜了的土地，现在都生长着茁壮的庄稼。

    西北水土保持考察团工作完毕
    中央人民政府水利部、农业部、林业部和各地有关部门共同组织的西北水土保持考察团，已在陕西和甘肃两省工作完毕，十六日从西安启程返回北京。考察团在五月六日到达西北地区后，先后在陕西省北部和甘肃省东部、南部、兰州等地区黄河中游各主要支流泾河、渭水、洛水、无定河流域，考察了水土流失情况，搜集了土壤、气候、水文、地面被覆等有关资料，并了解了当地农民保持水土的经验。考察团并与各地领导机关召开座谈会，交换了有关水土保持工作的意见。考察团团长张含英在西安期间曾向西北区、陕西省和西安市的干部作了
    “西北水土保持工作及治黄问题”的报告。考察团根据考察所得的材料，认为：在古代西北黄土高原上的被覆是森林草原地带，但是，由于过去的封建土地制度，造成了土地利用的不合理和严重的水土流失的情况。目前西北地区雨量虽感不足，而当地黄土的本质是好的，含有大量植物所需要的磷、钾等原素；今后只要进行合理的耕作制度和大力推行水土保持工作，还是可以获得高额丰产的。西北地区的水土保持工作的具体内容为：保原（水不下原），固沟（泥不出沟），护坡（土不下坡）和防沙（沙不南移）等。（新华社）
