Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of People's Daily

    Letter from the Fujian Provincial People's Government Finance Department: We sincerely accept the criticism made by Comrade Huang Wenyan in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on April 16th regarding the hurried timeframe of our department's construction appropriations last year, which led to waste in some units.
    Our department's budget expenditure in 1952 was concentrated in the autumn and winter seasons due to the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns in the first half of the year, and all capital construction projects were similarly delayed; furthermore, the continuous increase in tasks by higher-level departments in the autumn and winter seasons, as well as the additional budget approved by higher authorities for our province, made the appropriation process even more congested. The Provincial Party Committee attached great importance to this issue. Regarding capital construction and construction projects, it designated the establishment of a Construction Committee under the leadership of the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee, concentrating technical personnel and administrative cadres to set up design, labor allocation, material supply, and construction divisions to carry out the work with full force starting in September. To ensure the completion of capital construction tasks and avoid delays into the next year, it was stipulated that design work not completed by mid-October would no longer be designed, and construction not started before November would no longer be started. To conscientiously implement the year-end freeze and avoid waste, a general inspection was conducted again in early December, reviewing and finalizing each project, and stopping those projects that had been designed and started but were not progressing significantly. The remaining projects were mostly civil engineering, and the required bricks, tiles, stones, and materials were all rural sideline products, which had to be prepaid. The state-owned construction companies had no funds, so a deposit was prepaid after the contract was signed. It was also stipulated that for projects that could be completed by 80% or more and have the roof completed by mid-to-late December, the total amount would be paid; for those that reached 50% or more, 80% of the total amount would be paid; and for those that reached 30% or more, 50% of the total amount would be paid. Private contractors were required to strictly follow the basic construction procedures. Before the year-end freeze, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Financial and Economic Committee repeatedly studied the issue of projects spanning multiple years. After repeated tightening, the approved construction funds for projects spanning multiple years were greatly reduced. Some projects were actually completed, but not all funds were allocated, because capital construction projects were strictly handled according to the basic construction procedures. In general, we did our best to ensure proper implementation in the face of many tasks concentrated in the autumn and winter; projects that could not proceed according to the original plan due to difficult construction forces were also reduced according to regulations.
    However, in the entire construction work in the winter of 1952, due to the short timeframe and insufficient subjective efforts on our part, the shortcomings and errors in certain units and specific projects were serious. The main problem was that the construction of houses and dormitories, which were not handled according to basic construction procedures, had wider appropriation standards and did not fully comply with the stipulated appropriation methods. Although it was stipulated that advance payment of funds was allowed, only 90% of the payment was allowed before the project was completed and accepted; but we relaxed this slightly because many funds were only approved and allocated in the autumn, so we paid the full amount to those that completed 80%. On the one hand, this was because most of the houses in our province are built with wood, and after completing 80%, only some doors, windows, paint, and water and electricity equipment remained; but on the other hand, we were also afraid of delays into the next year and that it would be difficult to resolve in the future, so we deliberately accelerated the completion. This is worthy of deep reflection. For example, some units rushed to start construction and strive for more construction and early completion, which affected the quality of the project; individual units even prepared all the materials before starting construction, forming a "riding a tiger" situation, resulting in the loss of materials and the waste of transportation costs. In addition, due to the congestion of tasks at the end of the year, some projects were stopped midway, resulting in undue losses. The above problems were caused by our lax control of the system. We have since made a review to the higher authorities and put forward opinions on the implementation of the system last year. We should take this as a warning in the future to make our financial work more rigorous.

### 福建省人民政府财政厅对去年修建拨款情况的说明

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    福建省人民政府财政厅对去年修建拨款情况的说明
    福建省人民政府财政厅来信：四月十六日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了黄文彦同志对我厅去年修建拨款时间急促、造成某些单位浪费的缺点提出批评，我们诚恳接受。
    我厅一九五二年预算支付，由于上半年进行“三反”、“五反”，全年事业基本建设都集中在秋冬两季；又由于上级各部门在秋冬两季不断增加任务，以及本省经上级批准追加预算等，致拨款更加拥挤。省委对这一问题十分重视，关于基本建设及修建部分指定在省财委领导下成立修建委员会，集中技术人员及行政干部分设设计、劳动调配、器材供应及施工等机构，从九月起全力进行。为保证基本建设任务的完成，避免拖年度，规定设计工作在十月中旬未完成者即不再设计，十一月前未动工者即不再动工；为了认真执行年终冻结与避免浪费，于十二月初又普遍地进行了一次检查，一一审核定案，将已设计开工但进度不大的工程停止下来。其余部分大部为土木工程，所需砖瓦、石料、器材等都是农村副业产品，必须付款预购，而国营建筑公司又没有资金，故于合同签订后，即预付定金一部。并规定：凡在十二月中、下旬能完工达百分之八十以上、盖好屋顶者，照总数全付；达百分之五十以上者，付总数的百分之八十；达百分之三十以上者，付总数的百分之五十。对私人包商则规定应完全按基本建设程序办事。到年终冻结前，省委、省财委曾数度研究跨年度问题，经再三紧缩，将已批准动工的拖年度修建费又大量削减。其中有些工程实际已完工，但也没有全部拨款，原因是事业基本建设工程均严格按照基本建设程序办理。我们在许多任务集中在秋冬的情况下，总的方面，是尽了一切力量去求得妥善执行的；对于建筑力量困难而不能按原计划进行的，也是按制度削减了的。
    但在一九五二年冬季整个修建工作中，因时间短促，我们主观努力不够，在某些单位某些具体工程中，存在的缺点和错误是严重的。其中主要的是不按基本建设程序办理的房屋、宿舍修建，拨款尺度较宽，与规定拨款办法不尽符合。虽然按规定是准许预付资金的，但在工程完成而没有验收前，只准付百分之九十的款；而我们因当时许多款到秋季才批拨，故稍放宽，完成百分之八十者即全付。这一方面因为我省房屋多是木头修建的，完成百分之八十后，实际上只余一些门窗油漆、水电设备而已；但另一方面，我们思想上也是怕拖年度、将来不好解决，有意赶速完成。这是值得深刻检讨的。再如：有些单位抢先施工和争取多施工、早完工，以致影响了工程质量；个别单位竟至全部备料后再施工，形成“骑虎难下”，造成器材的损失和搬运费的浪费。此外，因年终任务拥挤，部分工程中途停止下来，遭到了不应有的损失。以上问题，是我们掌握制度不严造成的，事后曾向上级检讨，并提出去年执行制度中的意见，今后当引以为鉴，使财务工作做得更严密。
