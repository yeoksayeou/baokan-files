Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: According to TASS, Moscow: Ilya Ehrenburg published an article titled "The People's Oath" in the "Pravda" on the 5th, reviewing the work of the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest. Ehrenburg pointed out: During the days when the conference was held, many things happened that were difficult to consider pleasant: a group of Nazi bandits sneaked into Potsdam Square in Berlin, the despicable and shameless Syngman Rhee, with the support of prominent figures, issued an order to undermine the armistice agreement, and the news of the execution of the Rosenbergs aroused worldwide indignation. There are many shadows, and those with wavering will may doubt, has the situation really changed? Did the participants in the meeting say that the forces of peace had triumphed, was it too rash to say so?

Of course, no one in the World Peace Council, either before or now, believes that those who clamor for war have been destroyed and that the danger has passed. Reactionary forces have always and continue to base their wishful thinking on a third world war; some of them do it to make money, and others to steal peace. The forces of war have been trying to launch a counter-offensive, and those who are clearly aware that they are doomed and are already hopeless are fighting in the vanguard for them. At the forefront of the enemies of peace are Adenauer, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee. This is an international of bankrupt gamblers, an international of desperate villains. Indeed, what does peace mean to the old-line despot Syngman Rhee, who is hated on both sides of the 38th parallel? After the reunification of Germany and the withdrawal of all occupying forces, what hope does Adenauer have of continuing to rule?

But peace fighters are not distressed by the vicious attacks of the forces of war. On the contrary, they believe that the adventures of the German revanchists, the despicable tricks of the South Korean dictators, and the nervous cries of Senator McCarthy and his friends are new evidence that the forces of peace have triumphed. The fact that the people of all countries have put the issue of resolving all disputes through consultation on the agenda has infuriated all the politicians and stockbrokers who live off the Cold War. But one provocation, or even ten provocations, cannot make one forget the changes that have taken place in the past few months, such as the agreement in Korea, the British Prime Minister's speech advocating peaceful resolution of all disputes, and the results of the Italian elections. The wheel of history cannot be reversed; only when the people do not see peaceful resolution as an achievable reality can they tolerate the threat of cold and hot wars. Now, even the smartest, richest, and craziest people cannot drive mankind back into the dark depths of despair. This is why the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest focused on discussing the peaceful resolution of disputes.

Ehrenburg said: The Budapest meeting was a harmonious meeting; the idea that consultation is necessary and possible united everyone - this idea has matured. Peace fighters are now launching the broadest and most important movement centered on the Budapest Conference Declaration, and they have the support of an overwhelming majority of the people.

The Soviet people will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of all other countries in safeguarding the cause of peace. We are willing to defend peace with all our courage, with the indomitable spirit inherent in our people. The Soviet government is doing and will do its utmost to ensure that the spirit of consultation prevails over the policy of war. At the same time, we, the Soviet people, support the Budapest Conference Declaration with the entire will of a great peace-loving country. We extend a hand of friendship to the people of all countries.

Ehrenburg concluded: In these months of decisive significance in the history of our generation, peace advocates face arduous work. The people of all countries can thwart the plans of those forces that fear peace. The people can not only force the puppet Syngman Rhee to recognize and implement the Korean agreement, but also force the string-pullers behind the jumping puppet to do so. The people of all countries can prevent Nazi bandits from re-mobilizing. The people of all countries can eliminate all existing obstacles or obstacles that will appear on the road to peace tomorrow. The people realize that peace can be achieved, and they will do their utmost to achieve a sincere, glorious, and just peace.

    爱伦堡发表文章论世界人民的和平事业
    布达佩斯会议宣言得到压倒多数人民支持
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：伊里亚·爱伦堡在五日的“真理报”上发表一篇题为“人民的宣誓”的文章，回顾世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的工作。爱伦堡指出：在会议举行的那些日子里，发生了许多很难认为是愉快的事情：一群纳粹匪徒溜进了柏林波茨坦广场，卑鄙无耻的李承晚在显赫人物支持下下了一道破坏停战协议的命令，罗森堡夫妇被执行死刑的消息引起了全世界的愤慨。阴影还有许多，意志不坚强的人可能会怀疑，局势真是有了变化吗？参加会议的人说和平力量胜利了，这样说是不是太轻率了呢？
    当然，以前和现在的世界和平理事会中都没有人相信叫嚣战争的人已经被摧毁，危险已经过去。反动势力一向并继续以第三次世界大战作为他们的如意算盘的根据，他们中有些人为了发财，还有些人是为了借此偷安。战争力量一直在企图发动反攻，为他们打前哨战的是一些清楚地认识到他们注定要完蛋、他们已经是无望的人们，在和平的敌人的最前列的是阿登纳、蒋介石和李承晚。这是一群倾家荡产的赌徒的国际，是不要命的恶棍的国际。的确，对于在三八线两边都为人憎恨的李承晚这个老牌专制者，和平意味着什么呢？在德国统一、所有占领军撤出后，阿登纳还有什么继续执政的希望呢？
    但是和平战士并不为战争力量的恶毒攻击所苦恼，相反的，他们认为德国报复主义者的冒险，南朝鲜独裁者的卑鄙诡计，参议员麦卡锡和他的朋友的神经质的叫嚣，是证明和平力量得到了胜利的新的证据。各国人民把举行协商解决一切争端这件事提上了议程，这可激怒了所有靠冷战为生的政客和股票经纪人。但是，一次挑衅、甚至是十次挑衅，是不能够使一个人忘记在过去几个月里面所发生的变化的，如在朝鲜的协议，英国首相力主和平解决一切争端的演说，意大利选举的结果等。历史的巨轮是不能扭转的；只有在人民还看不到和平解决是一个能够实现的现实的时候，他们才能容忍冷战和热战的威胁。现在，甚至是最聪明、最富有、最疯狂的人也不能把人类赶回到绝望的黑暗里去。这就是世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议所以要集中力量讨论用和平方法解决争端的原因。
    爱伦堡说：布达佩斯会议是一次和谐的会议；协商是必要的而且是可能的这个思想团结了所有的人——这个思想已经成熟了。和平战士现在正以布达佩斯会议宣言为中心发动最广泛的、最重要的运动，他们得到了压倒多数的人民的支持。
    苏联人民将继续和所有其他国家人民并肩维护和平事业。我们愿意用全部勇气，用我们人民所固有的坚忍的精神来保卫和平。苏联政府正在并且将要尽最大力量，来使协商精神战胜战争政策。同时，我们苏联人民以一个伟大的爱好和平的国家的整个意志来支持布达佩斯会议的宣言。我们向各国人民伸出友谊之手。
    爱伦堡最后说：在我们这一代历史上具有决定意义的几个月里，和平拥护者面临着艰巨的工作。各国人民可以挫败那些害怕和平的势力的计划。人民不但可以迫使傀儡李承晚承认和实施朝鲜协议，同时也可以迫使乱蹦乱跳的傀儡后面的牵线人也这样做。各国人民可以阻止纳粹匪徒重新动员。各国人民可以排除一切现有的障碍或明天将出现在通向和平的道路上的障碍。人民认识到，和平是可以得到的，他们将尽最大的力量来取得真诚的、光荣的和公正的和平。
