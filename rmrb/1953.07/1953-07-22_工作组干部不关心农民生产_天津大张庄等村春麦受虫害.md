A letter from Liu Ning of the Tianjin Jinbei District People's Government: This year's spring wheat is growing particularly well in the silting area of the newly opened diversion canal in Qujiadian, Tianjin, including Dazhangzhuang and seven or eight other villages. Many older people say they have never seen such strong wheat in their lives.

However, in mid-June, "armyworms" appeared in the wheat fields, eating large patches of wheat into a mottled, patchy appearance. In wheat fields severely affected by the insect plague, the wheat has been eaten down to bare stalks.

When the local farmers discovered the insect pests, they reported it to the government. However, the work team sent by the Tianjin Jinbei District People's Government did not pay attention to this serious situation. They neither reported it to the district nor mobilized the masses to eliminate the insects. Instead, they continued to organize the masses to conduct wheat appraisals and seed selection, which caused the insect plague to develop very seriously. The farmers were very distressed, and many farmers muttered behind their backs: "What's the point of appraisal if the wheat is eaten up?" Only after the Jinbei District Committee and the District People's Government of the Chinese Communist Party learned of this serious situation did they organize farmers to catch and beat the insects, but it was too late, and the wheat suffered serious losses. It is suggested that the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government should investigate this matter and properly educate those cadres who do not care about the masses' production.

    工作组干部不关心农民生产
    天津大张庄等村春麦受虫害
    天津市津北区人民政府刘宁来信：天津市屈家店新开引河放淤区一带大张庄等七八个村子，今年的春麦长得特别好，不少上年岁的老人都说，活了一辈子还没有看见过这么强的麦子。
    但是在六月中旬，这一带麦地里普遍发生“黏虫”，大片麦子被吃成块块花叶，虫灾严重的麦地中麦子已被吃成光杆了。
    当地农民一发现虫害时，就向政府反映。但天津市津北区人民政府派到当地的工作组对这个严重情况竟不加重视，他们既不向区上汇报，又不发动群众除虫，却仍旧要组织群众进行小麦评比和选种工作，以致虫害发展得十分严重。农民们十分心痛，不少农民背地念叨说：麦子吃光了还评比什么？到中共津北区工委、区人民政府知道了这一严重情况后，才组织农民进行捕打，但时间已晚，麦子受到了严重的损失。建议中共天津市委会、天津市人民政府应该对这件事进行检查，好好教育那些不关心群众生产的干部。
