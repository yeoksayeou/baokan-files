Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 10th. (By our special correspondent Jiang Nan) The meetings of the delegations from both sides of the Korean armistice, which were interrupted for twenty days due to Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war with U.S. connivance, resumed today. Since the meeting was confidential, details are unknown. However, whether the U.S. is willing to provide definite and effective guarantees on the implementation of the armistice agreement will undoubtedly determine whether the armistice can be achieved soon.

    News from Seoul says that Syngman Rhee is still frantically opposing the Korean armistice. Today, through his spokesman, Keung Hong-ki, he issued a statement demanding that Clark not respond to the Korean-Chinese side's letter agreeing to resume negotiations on the implementation of the armistice agreement. This is, in effect, asking the United States to refuse the armistice with him. Syngman Rhee issued this statement knowing that the plenary session of the delegations was being held today, obviously to show the United States his firm opposition to the armistice.

    In order for the Korean armistice to be achieved quickly, what is needed is for the U.S. to change its attitude of connivance towards Syngman Rhee and take effective measures to make Syngman Rhee accept the armistice. The question now is: Does the armistice include Syngman Rhee? If it is not included, how will the armistice agreement be implemented in South Korea? If it is included, how can it be guaranteed that Syngman Rhee's army will abide by the armistice agreement?

    Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai raised these questions in their letter to Clark on June 19. However, Clark's reply ten days later was ambiguous in answering these questions.

    Clark did not definitively answer whether the Korean armistice included Syngman Rhee's government and army. He only said that the armistice was a "military armistice between the two commanders and involves the troops that the two commanders can use."

    If the Korean armistice includes Syngman Rhee's government and army, then how will the U.S. guarantee that Syngman Rhee's army will abide by all relevant clauses in the armistice agreement after the armistice agreement is signed? For example, will Syngman Rhee's army completely cease fire within twelve hours after the agreement is signed? Will Syngman Rhee's army withdraw two kilometers from the military demarcation line across the entire line within seventy-two hours to establish a demilitarized zone? If Syngman Rhee's army refuses to cease fire and refuses to withdraw, what effective measures is the U.S. prepared to take to guarantee the true implementation of the armistice? Clark's letter of June 29 did not provide definite answers to these questions. He only said that the United Nations Command would "make every effort to obtain the cooperation of the Government of the Republic of Korea." It is very clear that if the U.S. cannot take practical and effective measures to guarantee that all United Nations forces, including Syngman Rhee's army, abide by the armistice agreement, then there will be no possibility of a true ceasefire throughout Korea, and the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stipulated in the armistice agreement will not be able to perform their duties. In this way, even if the armistice agreement is signed, it will only be a piece of paper.

    If the Korean armistice does not include Syngman Rhee's government and army, then even if the armistice agreement is signed by the representative of the United Nations Command on behalf of one party, the Korean War will not actually stop, because the Syngman Rhee government has repeatedly stated that once the armistice agreement is signed, the South Korean army will withdraw from the United Nations Command and fight on its own. If the United Nations Command continues to adopt an attitude of connivance towards Syngman Rhee, it is tantamount to saying that the purpose of the United Nations Command signing the armistice agreement is to allow Syngman Rhee to undermine it, and to allow Syngman Rhee to continue fighting. It is obvious that the people of the world do not need such an "armistice."

    In order to ensure that the armistice agreement truly takes effect, the U.S. must propose concrete and effective solutions to the above issues and ensure that these solutions are implemented. This is the U.S.'s unavoidable responsibility.

    The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly and clearly expressed its sincerity for the armistice through its actions. The U.S. also claims that they want an armistice. But do they want to delay the armistice, or are they willing to achieve the armistice quickly? This depends on how the U.S. negotiating representatives answer the above questions at the meeting.

### 美方必须保证使李承晚遵守停战协定

    美方必须保证使李承晚遵守停战协定
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者江南报道：因李承晚在美方纵容下“释放”战俘事件曾中断了二十天的朝鲜停战双方代表团会议今天恢复了会议。由于会议是秘密性的，详情不得而知。但是，美方愿不愿在实施停战协定的问题上提出确定的有效的保证，无疑将决定停战能不能早日实现。
    来自汉城的消息说，李承晚依然疯狂反对朝鲜停战。他今天通过他的发言人葛弘基发表了一个声明，要求克拉克不要答复朝中方面同意恢复谈判商谈停战协定实施问题的信。这实际上就是要美国跟他一起拒绝停战。李承晚在明知代表团大会在今天举行以后还发表这个声明，显然是为了向美国表示他坚决反对停战的态度。
    为了使朝鲜停战能够迅速实现，需要的是美方改变对李承晚的纵容态度，采取有效措施使李承晚接受停战。现在的问题是：停战是不是包括李承晚在内？如果不包括在内，停战协定在南朝鲜将如何实施？如果包括在内，又如何保证李承晚的军队能遵守停战协定？
    金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员在六月十九日给克拉克的信里已经提出了这些问题。但是克拉克在十天以后的复信里，对这些问题的回答是含糊其词的。
    克拉克并没有确定地回答朝鲜停战究竟包括不包括李承晚的政府和军队在内。他只说停战是“双方司令官之间的军事停战，并涉及双方司令官所能以使用的部队”。
    如果朝鲜停战包括李承晚的政府和军队在内，那末，当停战协定签字以后，美方怎样保证李承晚的军队能遵守停战协定中所有有关条款呢？比方说，李承晚的军队是否将在协定签字后十二小时内完全停火？李承晚的军队是否在七十二小时内全线从军事分界线后撤二公里以成立非军事区？如果李承晚的军队拒绝停火、拒绝后撤，那么美方准备采取什么有效措施来保证停战的真正实施呢？克拉克六月二十九日的来信对这些问题并没有作确定的答复，他只说联合国军将“尽一切努力以取得大韩民国政府的合作”。很显然，如果美方不能以实际有效的措施来保证包括李承晚军队在内的一切联合国军都遵守停战协定，那末，朝鲜全境即无真正停火的可能，而停战协定中所规定的军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会更谈不上执行它们的职务了。这样，停战协定即使签订，也不过只一纸空文而已。
    如果朝鲜停战不包括李承晚的政府和军队在内，那末，纵使停战协定由联合国军的代表代表一方签字，朝鲜战争实际上并不能停止，因为李承晚政府已一再声明，一旦停战协定签字，南朝鲜的军队将从联合国军中撤出而单独打下去，如果联合国军对李承晚继续采取纵容的态度，那就等于说联合国军签订停战协定的目的是为了让李承晚来破坏它，是为了让李承晚继续打下去。这样的“停战”怎么能算做停战呢？全世界人民不需要这样的“停战”，这是显而易见的。
    为了保证停战协定得以真正生效，美方必须对上述各项问题提出具体有效的办法，并保证这些办法付诸实施。这是美方无可规避的责任。
    朝中方面已经一再用行动明确地表示了对停战的诚意。美方也宣称他们是要停战的。但是他们究竟是要拖延停战呢，还是愿意迅速实现停战呢？这就要看美方谈判代表在会议上如何回答上述这些问题。
