    Since the Second World War, the United States has been striving to invade the Middle East in all aspects, squeezing out Britain, which has long held a dominant position in the region. The United States is particularly covetous of the Suez Canal Zone in Egypt. On March 14 this year, the United States proposed a so-called "joint US-British proposal" to Egypt, under which US and British "experts" would jointly "supervise" the Suez Canal Zone military base after the withdrawal of British troops. The intention of this plan is obvious: to turn the Suez Canal Zone, which is solely occupied by Britain, into a US-British jointly occupied military base. According to a recent Associated Press report, after US Secretary of State Dulles visited the Middle East this spring, he "changed his tune" again, agreeing with Egypt's claim that "Britain should first withdraw unconditionally (from the Suez Canal Zone) before defense issues can be discussed." The intention of Dulles' "shift" is also obvious: on the one hand, the United States wants to use this to win Egypt's favor, and on the other hand, it wants to completely seize Britain's control over this important region. As the United States intensifies its invasion of the Suez Canal Zone by taking advantage of the deteriorating Anglo-Egyptian relations, the contradictions between the United States and Britain on the Suez Canal Zone issue are becoming increasingly acute.
    The Suez Canal Zone, under the contention of the United States and Britain, is important both economically and militarily. It is a vital passage for Euro-Asian transportation, the "lifeline" for Western imperialist countries to reach their colonies and dependencies in the East; Britain has established the largest military base in the Middle East in the area west of the Suez Canal, as its base for controlling the entire Middle East "sphere of influence".
    The Suez Canal runs through the narrow strip of land connecting Asia and Africa, guarding the eastern exit of the Mediterranean Sea. It is 166 kilometers long, 119 meters wide, and 12.8 meters deep, capable of navigating large ships of 45,000 tons. In 1950, when cargo volume reached its peak, a total of 11,751 ships and more than 81.78 million tons of goods passed through.
    The Suez Canal significantly shortens the voyage from Western Europe to East Asia: from London to Mumbai, it is shortened by 24 days; from Trieste to Mumbai, it is shortened by 37 days; and from Marseille to Mumbai, the voyage is halved.
    The importance of the Suez Canal to Western European countries can also be demonstrated by the quantity and types of goods passing through the canal. Taking 1950 as an example, the goods transported from south to north through the Suez Canal accounted for approximately 74 percent of the total goods passing through the canal, and among these goods transported from south to north, oil accounted for 79 percent. This oil mainly comes from Middle Eastern oil-producing countries such as Kuwait, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.
    British ships account for the largest number of ships passing through the canal. Up to the Second World War, 52.5 percent were British ships. The British government holds 177,000 of the 400,000 shares of the "Suez Canal Company". Among the 32 members of the management of the "Suez Canal Company", 16 are French, 10 are British, 4 are Egyptian, 1 is Dutch, and 1 is American. In reality, the power is in the hands of the British.
    Britain has obtained huge profits from the "Suez Canal Company". The Suez Canal began excavation in 1859 and took eleven years to complete. 20,000 Egyptians sacrificed their lives due to overwork and disease. The cost of excavation was a little over 400 million francs, but from 1870 to 1930, the company's profits reached 3.5 billion francs, most of which was obtained by Britain, while Egypt only received 7 percent. In 1950 alone, the tax collected from ships passing through the canal reached 80 million US dollars.
    Britain not only controls the canal zone through the "Suez Canal Company," but more importantly, Britain has established a huge military base on the west bank of the Suez Canal, spanning 90 miles north to south and 60 miles east to west. According to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, Britain was only allowed to station 10,000 troops in the Suez Canal Zone, but according to British Prime Minister Churchill's recent admission, British troops now number 80,000. Originally, the Suez Canal Zone was only for British military training, but today Britain has established a total of 37 military facilities in this area, including ten fully equipped air force bases and many power stations, reservoirs, docks, firing ranges, repair shops, hospitals, training schools, etc.
    The military headquarters of the British controlling the entire Middle East and Near East region is located in Fayid in the canal zone. The headquarters of the British Commander-in-Chief of ground forces in the Middle East, the joint command of the British land, sea, and air forces in the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and the headquarters of the British forces in Egypt are all located here.
    The largest arsenal of the British in this region is located in Tel El Kebir. This warehouse is seventeen miles long and fifteen square miles in area, and is operated by approximately 13,000 British officers and soldiers, as well as approximately 1,000 Egyptians. But the ordnance it stores only accounts for a quarter of the total storage in the Suez Canal Zone.
    The enormity and importance of the Suez Canal Zone military base can also be seen from the fact that during the Second World War, the canal zone base supplied personnel and equipment equivalent to twenty-eight infantry divisions and thirteen armored divisions, as well as naval forces and approximately sixty-five air force squadrons. Currently stored here are large quantities of ammunition, oil, grain, thousands of vehicles, and a large amount of bridging equipment, locomotives, and cranes. British officials estimate that the value of these military supplies exceeds 200 million pounds. As for the fixed equipment, the estimated value is 300 million pounds.
    For such a valuable military base, Britain is doing everything possible to maintain its original position, and the United States is desperately invading, attempting to replace Britain's position. However, the awakened Egyptian people are resolutely waging a heroic struggle to drive out the British troops and oppose the United States replacing Britain in occupying Egyptian territory.

### 美国竭力侵入的苏彝士运河区

    美国竭力侵入的苏彝士运河区
    第二次世界大战后，美国竭力从各方面侵入中东，排挤长久以来在这地区占优势地位的英国。美国并特别垂涎埃及境内的苏彝士运河区。今年三月十四日，美国曾向埃及提出一个所谓美英“联合建议”，由美英“专家”共同“监督”英军撤退后的苏彝士运河区军事基地。这个计划的用意很明显，就是要把英国单独占领的苏彝士运河区变为美英共同占领的军事基地。据最近合众社透露，美国国务卿杜勒斯在今年春天访问中东之后，又“改变了腔调”，赞成埃及的主张，即：“首先英国应无条件地撤出
    （苏彝士运河区），然后才能谈防务问题”。杜勒斯这个“转变”的用意也很明显，就是美国一方面想借此骗取埃及的好感，一方面想完全攫取英国对这个重要区域的控制权。随着美国利用英埃关系的恶化而加紧侵入苏彝士运河区，美国和英国在苏彝士运河区问题上的矛盾正越来越尖锐。
    美英角逐下的苏彝士运河区无论在经济方面或军事方面都具有重要性。它是欧亚交通的要道，西方帝国主义国家通往它们在东方的殖民地和附属国的“生命线”；英国在苏彝士运河西岸地区内建立了一个中东最大的军事基地，作为它控制整个中东“势力范围”的根据地。
    苏彝士运河贯穿连接亚洲和非洲的狭长地带，扼地中海的东面出口，全长一百六十六公里，宽一百十九公尺，深十二点八公尺，可航行四万五千吨的大轮船。在载货量达最高峰的一九五零年，共有一万一千七百五十一艘轮船和八千一百七十八万多吨货物通过。
    苏彝士运河使西欧到东亚的航程缩短了很多：由伦敦到孟买，缩短了二十四天；由的里雅斯特到孟买，缩短了三十七天；由马赛到孟买，缩短了一半航程。
    苏彝士运河对西欧国家的重要性还可从通过运河的货物的数量和种类得到证明。以一九五零年为例，通过苏彝士运河由南运到北的货物共占通过运河的总货物量的约百分之七十四，而在这些由南运到北的货物中，石油占百分之七十九。这些石油主要是来自科威特、伊朗和沙特阿拉伯等中东产油国家。
    通过运河的船只以英国船为最多。截至第二次世界大战为止，共有百分之五十二点五是英国船。英国政府握有“苏彝士运河公司”四十万股股票中的十七万七千股。在管理“苏彝士运河公司”的经理部三十二人中，法国人十六名，英国人十名，埃及人四名，荷兰人一名，美国人一名。实际上，大权掌握在英国手里。
    英国从“苏彝士运河公司”取得了巨大的利润。苏彝士运河于一八五九年开始掘凿，经过十一年才完成，因过度劳动和疾病而牺牲的埃及人有两万名。开掘的费用是四亿法郎多一点，但在一八七零到一九三零年，该公司的利润即达三十五亿法郎，其中大部为英国所得，埃及只得到百分之七。单在一九五零年，向通过运河的船只收的税，就达八千万美元。
    英国不仅通过“苏彝士运河公司”控制运河区，更重要的，英国在苏彝士运河西岸南北长九十英里和东西宽六十英里范围内建立起来的巨大军事基地。根据一九三六年英埃条约，英国在苏彝士运河区只准驻军一万人，但是，仅根据英国首相邱吉尔最近所承认的，英国驻军现在已达八万人。原来规定苏彝士运河区只供英军训练之用，但今天英国已在这个地区共建立了三十七个军事设施，其中包括十个有完备装备的空军基地和许多发电站、水库、码头、打靶场、修理厂、医院、训练学校等。
    英国控制整个中东、近东地区的军事总部设在运河区的法伊德。英国驻中东地面部队总司令部，英国驻中东和地中海的陆、海、空军联合司令部以及英国驻埃及军队司令部都设在这里。
    英国在这地区的最大军械库设于特勒·厄尔·凯比尔。这个仓库周围长十七英里，面积十五平方英里，操作人员除一万三千名英国官兵外，还有约一千名埃及人。但它所储存的军械，还只占苏彝士运河区总储存量的四分之一。
    苏彝士运河区军事基地的巨大和重要性还可从这样的事实看出来：在第二次世界大战中，运河区基地供应了等于二十八个步兵师、十三个装甲师的人员装备，以及海军部队和约六十五个空军中队。目前储存在这里的有大量的弹药、油类、粮食、数以千计的车辆以及大量的架桥设备、火车头和起重机。英国官方估计，这些军用品的价值超过二亿英镑。至于那些固定的设备，估计价值达三亿英镑。
    对于这样的一个有价值的军事基地，英国正尽一切力量来保持它的原有地位，美国正拼命侵入，企图取英国的地位而代之。但是，觉醒起来了的埃及人民，正在坚决地为驱逐英国驻军并反对美国代替英国来占领埃及领土而进行着英勇的斗争。
