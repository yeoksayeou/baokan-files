How to Correctly Use the Point-to-Surface Leadership Method
Rural Work Department of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

According to our inspection and reports from various counties, the following problems exist in the application of "typical chain demonstration," "one station, three networks," and other point-to-surface leadership methods in various regions.

I. The Selection of Key Villages and Groups. Based on the situation in Songjiang Province, the vast majority of regions use the best-performing advanced villages and groups (cooperatives) as base-point villages and key groups, and concentrate strong and numerous cadres to work in these points. Undoubtedly, selecting some advanced villages and groups (cooperatives) with a good work foundation, relatively superior natural conditions, strong leadership conditions, and high mass awareness as the focus of leadership, in order to discover new problems, obtain advanced experiences, and effectively strengthen cultivation, so that it becomes a banner and model of rural production, playing a leading and exemplary role, is conducive to guiding and promoting overall work. However, one issue worthy of study here is how to effectively use the experiences of these advanced points to guide the work of the majority of general villages and groups and the backward villages and groups that still account for one-third or one-quarter. Judging from the current situation, the experiences of many advanced villages and groups are often not accepted by general or backward villages and groups. Because general, and especially backward, villages and groups still lack the foundation and conditions of advanced villages and groups, they can only hold a longing but unattainable attitude towards the experiences of advanced villages and groups. They say: "These experiences are good, but we don't have the conditions here; it won't work, we can't do it." If this continues to be done frequently, it will easily promote one-sidedness in guiding overall work. Because leaders at all levels mostly settle in advanced villages and groups, they lack inspection and understanding of the overall situation, and the requirements and plans for overall work will inevitably be too hasty and too high. Therefore, we believe that in the selection of base points, consideration can be given to consciously and purposefully selecting base-point villages or key groups that can represent the upper, middle, and lower categories of situations and characteristics within a county or district, changing the current situation in which the vast majority of typical villages and groups are located in advanced villages and groups, so that the typical experience is more in line with the actual situation of the whole, and is easy to spread and promote.

II. The Cultivation of Typical Examples. In terms of cultivation methods, there are currently two main different methods. One is: in key villages, the village branch leadership is the main force, giving full play to the branch's initiative and creativity in its work, while the county and district cadres responsible for leading the work of the village only play a guiding and advisory role; in key groups (cooperatives), the main reliance is on the leading backbone of the group (cooperative), and the village branch and county and district cadres, in addition to helping to come up with ideas and find solutions to specific problems, also help to cultivate leading backbone and help them establish and improve the leadership core. The work experience gained from this approach is personally explored and created by the masses under the guidance and assistance of county and district cadres; therefore, these experiences are practical and effective, and feasible. This overcomes the past phenomenon where things were bustling and lively when cadres were present, but cold and desolate when cadres left. The other method is: cadres take over everything, doing everything themselves, putting the village branch and group (cooperative) leadership backbone in a subordinate and obedient position. For example, in spring plowing production, in order to spread the use of improved farm tools and implement wide-sowing cultivation methods, many districts cadres personally took charge of a complete set of ploughs and personally performed operations, causing the village and group cadres and masses to stand idly by; then, when promoting the experience to the outside world, they called it the experience of so-and-so village and so-and-so group. As a result, the masses in this village and group thought it was fabricated, while the masses in other villages and groups thought that so-and-so village and group were bragging, not only not accepting it, but also criticizing and satirizing it, which affected the unity among the masses. We should vigorously promote and use the former method in the future, and resolutely correct the latter method.

III. How to Use Points to Guide Surface Work. The main tendency at present is: regardless of the size of the matter, they want to adopt typical demonstration and "one station, three networks" leadership methods, treating it as a "panacea." Another situation is that they did not do a solid job of preparation in advance, had no clear idea of ​​what to do, and hastily created a typical example, resulting in a mere formality, wasting manpower and money. If this phenomenon is not paid attention to and overcome, it will inevitably cause great losses to future work. We believe that in the future, in addition to new work with universality or generality, or problems with major key points, or major technical issues in the current increase in production, the method of cultivating typical examples and organizing the masses to observe and learn can be adopted, while other general work should not adopt or should rarely adopt this method; more attention should be paid during the busy farming season. If it is necessary to adopt the method of typical demonstration for dissemination and promotion, a solid job of preparation must be done in advance, the experience and methods of dissemination should be simple and easy to implement, the observation time should be short, and the number of participants should not be too large. And you can take the form of chain demonstrations or professional meetings held with points as units, and don't always mobilize the masses to visit. No matter which method is adopted, attention must be paid to practical results.

    怎样正确运用点面结合的领导方法
    中共松江省委农村工作部
    根据我们的检查和各县的报告，各地在运用“典型连环示范”、“一站三网”等点面结合的领导方法上，有以下一些问题。
    一、对重点村、组的选择问题。根据松江省的情况，各地绝大多数都是以工作最好的先进村、组（社）作为基点村和重点组，并且集中较强和较多的干部在这些点里工作。毫无疑义，选一些工作基础较好，自然条件较为优越，领导条件较强，群众觉悟较高的先进村、组（社）做为领导的重点，以便从中发现新的问题，取得先进经验，并切实加强培养，使它成为农村生产的旗帜和榜样，起带头示范作用，是有利于对全面工作的指导和推动的。但这里值得研究的一个问题，就是如何有效地用这些先进点的经验来指导多数的一般村、组和仍占三分之
    一或四分之一的落后村、组的工作。从目前情况来看，不少的先进村、组的经验，常常不能被一般的或落后的村、组所接受。因为一般的特别是落后的村、组还缺乏先进村、组那样的基础和条件，所以它们对先进村、组的经验只能抱着可望而不可即的态度。他们说：“这些经验好是好，就是我们这里没条件，行不通，办不了。”如果经常这样做下去，也容易促成对全面工作指导上的片面性。因为各级领导干部多落脚在先进村、组，对全面情况缺乏检查和了解，对全面工作的要求和计划势必过急过高。因此，我们认为，对基点的选择，可考虑在一个县、区之内，有意识有目的地分别选择能代表上、中、下三类情况与特点的基点村或重点组，改变目前绝大多数典型村、组都是设在先进村、组的现状，以便使典型的经验更加切合全面的实际情况，便于传播推广。
    二、对典型的培养问题。在培养方法上，从目前看来，主要有两种不同的方法。一种是：在重点村，以该村支部领导为主，充分发挥支部在工作上的主动性和创造性，而负责领导该村工作的县区干部只起辅导和参谋作用；在重点组（社），主要是依靠该组（社）的领导骨干，村支部和县区干部除帮助出主意想办法解决具体问题外，并帮助培养领导骨干，帮助他们建立和健全领导核心。这种作法得到的工作经验，是群众在县区干部指导帮助下亲自摸索和创造的；因此，这些经验是实际有效的，切实可行的。这就克服了过去那种干部在时轰轰烈烈，干部走了冷冷清清的现象。另一种是：干部包办代替，一切亲自动手，使村支部和组（社）的领导骨干处于附属和听从地位。如在春耕生产中，不少地区为了传播使用改良农具实行宽播的耕作方法，区干部亲自包下一付整装齐备的犁杖，亲自进行操作表演，使该村、组的干部和群众袖手旁观；然后向外推广经验时，却称之为某某村、某某组的经验。结果，本村本组群众认为是虚造假做，而外村外组群众则认为某村某组是吹牛承功，不仅不接受，反而批评讽刺，使群众间的团结受了影响。我们今后应大量提倡和运用前一种方法，坚决纠正后一种方法。
    三、怎样以点指导面的工作。目前主要的偏向是：不论大事小事，都想采用典型示范和“一站三网”的领导方法，把它当成“万金油”来运用。还有一种情形是事先没有切实做好准备工作，心中无数，仓促搞典型，结果徒具形式，劳民伤财。这种现象如不注意防止和克服，势必使今后工作大受损失。我们认为，今后除带有普遍性或一般性的新的工作，或带有重大关键性的问题，或当前增产中的主要技术问题，可采取培养典型、组织群众观摩学习的方法以外，其余一般性的工作，可不采取或少采取这种方法；农忙季节更应注意。需要采取典型示范的方法进行传播推广的，事先也要切实做好准备工作，传播的经验办法要简明易行，参观的时间要短，参加的人员不要过多。并可采取连环示范或以点为单位召开专业会议等方式，不要老是动员群众参观。不论采取那种方式，都必须注意实效。
