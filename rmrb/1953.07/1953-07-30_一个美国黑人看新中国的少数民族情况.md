    An American Black Man Looks at the Situation of Ethnic Minorities in New China
    United States　Louis Whitton
    I am a member of the largest ethnic minority in the United States. We are a black ethnic minority with a population of fifteen million, most of whom live in the southern United States, and the area we live in is called the "Black Belt." It is an agricultural area. There, black people suffer deeply.
    My parents grew up in the southern United States, and like my parents, I was raised and educated in the South. I have not only personally experienced the suffering of black people, but also learned about it from the stories told by my great-grandparents, grandparents, and parents.
    I also understand the suffering of ethnic minorities in the United States, such as Indians, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Asians, Irish, and Italians. For a long time, the American ruling class has obtained huge profits from these ethnic minorities through a divide-and-rule policy, leaving the ethnic minorities only able to make a meager living.
    National antagonism is created under the pretext of the theory of racial superiority. People of the majority ethnic group are educated in racial discrimination from the time they can speak until they leave the world. They differentiate one ethnic minority from another based on differences in skin color, language, and customs. In addition, they deliberately fabricate various stereotypes in an attempt to convince the American people that their discrimination against ethnic minorities is justified.
    This bad habit permeates all aspects of American life and becomes a source of huge profits for the ruling class. These profits are obtained by openly or secretly dividing and exploiting the various ethnic minorities, especially black people, to obtain cheap labor.
    Because I have suffered deeply from the policy of national discrimination in the United States, when I arrived in China, I naturally became concerned about the situation of ethnic minorities in China; in many cases, I was deeply moved.
    In China, I felt a sense of brotherly friendship, a sense that I was a member of the human family. People did not look at me differently because I am black. I rarely thought about my black skin. The special care that the Chinese majority ethnic group gives to ethnic minorities has deeply aroused my interest. Precisely because these ethnic minorities have suffered oppression in the past, they now receive more special care than the majority ethnic group. People consciously strive to elevate ethnic minorities to the same status as the majority ethnic group, paying particular attention to the overall well-being of ethnic minorities.
    Of course, I am not saying that when I go to places where people have never seen a black person before, I will not attract people's attention. Large groups of people gathered around to look at me, touch my skin and my hair, and talk to me. But the attitude of these people is very different from that of people in the United States. Here, there is warmth, a feeling of great friendship. This feeling I had previously felt almost only among black people. There is no hostile gaze, no animosity, no snobbish or contemptuous expression. I cannot express how much comfort I received from this feeling of these foreign people. This feeling of great friendship is truly a hope, an inspiration for all mankind.
    In China, when you step onto a bus or streetcar, people do not shy away from you as if they had encountered a patient with the plague or leprosy, as they do in New York and other parts of the United States. No one refuses to sit next to you because of the difference in your skin color. In restaurants, hotels, and hospitals, there is no difference in treatment, regardless of whether you come from the North or South, East or West.
    In the industrial areas of the Northeast, I saw people from ethnic minorities working in various industrial sectors, holding positions as managers, administrators, and technical personnel or general positions. In large-scale training classes, ethnic minority workers are being trained to become skilled technicians, and many of the labor models are from various ethnic minorities. There is no racial discrimination in employment. Many ethnic minority women who were previously confined to their homes are now coming out and contributing to China's industrialization. China's ethnic minorities, unlike black people, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans in the United States, are not designated to engage in special occupations; all kinds of occupations are open to them, and they work on a completely equal footing with the majority ethnic group.
    Has China always been like this in the past? Of course not. In the long period before liberation in 1949, China implemented a terrible system of racial oppression and exploitation similar to that in the United States, and the rulers created constant disputes between various ethnic groups in order to better exploit them. Autocratic emperors, landlords, and ruling groups specialized in spreading prejudice and hatred among ethnic minorities, and the US and British imperialists, who were skilled at instigating ethnic disputes, further incited and helped in these brutal acts of racial oppression.
    As a result of such practices, many ethnic minorities were entirely on the verge of extinction. People living in the United States will therefore recall the rapidly declining population of American Indians. The spread of diseases, the lack of sanitation, adequate food, and school education, as well as the loss of social and political rights, caused the decline of the Indians. The annual death rate of Indians greatly exceeded the birth rate, gradually tending towards extinction. Treating Indians by allowing them to die out is a crime against humanity.
    The People's Government of New China has promulgated laws that enable all ethnic minorities to enjoy all the rights of complete equality with other people. The People's Government has also implemented this law, helping various ethnic minorities establish their own regional autonomous governments. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, more than sixty ethnic minorities are moving forward at an extraordinarily rapid pace. The majority ethnic group closely monitors the culture of ethnic minorities as well as their growth and development, and strives to help improve their living standards and knowledge levels. Ethnic minorities no longer feel alienated and isolated from the majority ethnic group. They feel that they are in a happy family, fighting for the industrialization of the great motherland.
    In other words, New China has achieved peace throughout the country, and all ethnic groups have united together, and this close unity has brought new strength, enabling China to achieve industrialization in a very short period of time. It is worth noting that this unity, this brotherly friendship, was achieved through peaceful and mutually beneficial means. It is this peaceful attitude and policy that has treated me so kindly, and it shows the Chinese people's peaceful policy towards all countries and peoples in the world. It is impossible to implement one policy domestically and another policy abroad. The domestic policy of any country is reflected in its foreign policy, because they are interrelated and interdependent.
    We may examine some of the things I have seen in China from this point of view, that is, the domestic policy of the People's Republic of China reflects its foreign policy.
    Take the Oroqen ethnic minority as an example. Today, they are enjoying a happy life. What kind of life did they live before liberation? They were trapped in the forests, making a living by hunting, and were called "savages." For an entire century, they suffered barbaric oppression and were on the verge of extinction. Before liberation, they relied on hunting to maintain their lives, wearing furs all year round. At that time, illegal merchants colluded with reactionary rulers to plunder them, forcing them to sell valuable furs at extremely low prices. Opium smoking was openly and widely encouraged.
    Now, the Oroqen ethnic group has its own government and controls its own destiny. The establishment of the Oroqen National Autonomous Region in September 1951 immediately changed the trend of decline into a thriving situation. But their population is only over two thousand people, half of whom live in the autonomous region and half of whom live in neighboring areas.
    They have established three cooperatives, with 624 members. The cooperatives sell food, guns, and cloth, and purchase game, furs, and other products at very reasonable prices. The total turnover in the first nine months of 1952 was fifteen times that of the entire year of 1950. The Oroqen people no longer regard cotton cloth and good food as rare and difficult to obtain. Food and other items are transported to the forests, saving hunters the hard work of long journeys.
    With the restoration of political rights and the gradual improvement of living conditions, the population of the Oroqen ethnic group, which had been decreasing year by year before liberation, has begun to increase. People have also quit the bad habit of smoking opium. They have established a clinic, and doctors and nurses are conducting regular mobile medical services in the towering Xing'an Mountains, fighting against the diseases that have long plagued the area. In 1952, 80 percent of the population was vaccinated against smallpox, preventing the smallpox that had long plagued the forest area. At the time of liberation, illiteracy among the Oroqen ethnic group accounted for 97 percent of the entire population. Now, children receive government subsidies, and students also receive subsidies to study in primary and secondary schools in other parts of Inner Mongolia. The autonomous region government has also established training courses to train talents for various tasks that need to be carried out in the autonomous region. It is worth noting that many hunters have abandoned their nomadic lives and turned to farming. Their active actions in preventing forest fires in the vast mountainous areas also demonstrate their improved level of political awareness.
    Let us look again at the southwest. There live 18 million people of various ethnic minorities. The People's Government has adopted various methods to vigorously improve their agricultural production level. This year, 1.35 million pieces of agricultural equipment manufactured in China, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Hungary have been transported to this ethnic minority area, eliminating the shortage of agricultural equipment within three years.
    In the past, frequent crop failures were caused by a lack of irrigation facilities, but now this project has begun. In one county alone, the People's Government has allocated 270 million yuan for this purpose. Through this assistance from the government, the Dai, Lahu, and Achang ethnic groups have built 437 irrigation facilities and 240 kilometers of irrigation canals. Many agricultural technology stations and state-owned farms have been established for ethnic minorities.
    At a welcome reception held in Beijing at the beginning of this year to welcome the ethnic minority representatives visiting delegation, Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education, said: "In order to meet the needs of national construction and implement the ethnic policies in the Common Program, the people's governments at all levels attach great importance to the work of training ethnic minority cadres." In the past three years, the Central People's Government has established nine ethnic minority colleges and opened many ethnic cadre training courses for various ethnic groups. Now, more than 70,000 ethnic minority cadres have been trained throughout the country. This year, educational facilities in ethnic minority areas will be greatly expanded.
    In Xinjiang, on China's northwest border, where the Uyghur ethnic group accounts for 80 percent of the total population, almost half of the 78 county towns now have Uyghur telegraphs. It is the first time in history that people of the Uyghur ethnic group can send telegrams in their own language.
    In order to meet the increasingly urgent need of ethnic minorities in the northwest to learn culture, hundreds of thousands of textbooks written in various ethnic minority languages have been published. The Xinjiang People's Publishing House alone has published 700,000 copies of Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian textbooks.
    I immediately recall the policy of the United States towards Puerto Ricans. Americans not only despise their culture, but also force them to use English. Because the people are determined to preserve their national and cultural identity and their heritage, Spanish has been retained as the language of Puerto Rico. The United States has never considered how to preserve the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities, and some of the cultures that remain today are only the result of the struggle of ethnic minorities to maintain their unique cultural pride and dignity. The general practice in the United States is to say that everything that is not considered "American" is base, inferior, and worthless. We must learn from China how to respect the rights and cultural heritage of all peoples and help them develop.
    At the ethnic minority conference in the border area of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, a decision was made to provide practical assistance to 3,000 Kazakh people in the area. They will receive loans to build houses, develop a stable life, and establish their own autonomous governments.
    In Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, the planned public buildings have begun construction. The total area occupied by these new buildings is about 16,000 square meters, which includes a state-of-the-art cinema, a cattle plague vaccine factory, as well as government offices, workers' residences, and school buildings. The loans provided by the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet to Tibetan farmers will be sixteen times that of last year this year.
    Respecting the religion of ethnic minorities is another aspect of respecting ethnic minorities. In meetings held in Beijing and across the country, the religions of the people participating in the meetings are clearly investigated, and special arrangements are made to meet the religious needs of the representatives. A special kitchen has been established for the Hui people in the Beijing Hotel.
    The "Eid al-Fitr" celebration held in Ürümqi on June 14, attended by Muslims from the Uyghur, Hui, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tatar, and Tajik ethnic minorities, was a pleasant event. In the early morning, 46 mosques held prayers at the same time. After the ceremony, people dressed in festive costumes flocked to the streets, visiting and congratulating each other. At 10:00 a.m., the Provincial People's Government held a celebration, which was attended by leading cadres, imams of various mosques, and representatives of various party and government agencies.
    It can be seen from this that the policies implemented by the People's Republic of China are truly democratic policies of equality for all people, regardless of race and ethnicity. In addition, it can also be seen that the policies implemented by China are policies of peaceful economic construction for the happiness of the people.
    I assert that only unreasonable people would come to the conclusion that China, which implements such a policy, would pursue an aggressive foreign policy. The correct answer is exactly the opposite. What China is implementing domestically is the same proposition that Chinese leaders adhere to in their foreign policy, namely, international friendship, mutual respect for the rights and interests of all peoples, and economic and cultural exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
    The program formulated by the Chinese people is a program of peace, a program formulated to improve the welfare and living conditions of the Chinese people, and a program advocating peaceful coexistence of all peoples regardless of ethnicity or political system. Such a program requires peace in order to achieve the results that this policy can produce, namely, the results of peaceful coexistence of the people of the world.
    I am convinced that the United States needs to learn China's policy towards ethnic minorities. Long-standing prejudices and hatreds have been completely refuted, and people who have been killing each other for centuries have now gained a peaceful and happy life.
    Ethnic minorities who were discriminated against in China in the past are now treated with kindness. Although ethnic minorities in China account for only one-fourteenth of the country's population, ethnic minorities occupy 150 seats (about one-eighth of the total number of seats) in the upcoming National People's Congress. Because ethnic minorities in other regions still have the right to be elected, their seats in this important meeting are estimated to reach one-seventh. Let us look at the situation in the United States. Black people in the United States account for one-tenth of the country's population, but there are no black people among the 98 senators, and only two black people among the 300-plus members of the House of Representatives. Indians, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and other ethnic minorities do not even have one member of the House of Representatives. In most local councils, ethnic minorities do not have enough representatives, and most have no representatives at all.
    I ask the American people, especially our white brothers and sisters, to seriously consider this issue, study and explore it, in order to reach accurate conclusions. I especially call on our poor white brothers in the South, who have been deceived and poisoned for a long time. What kind of suffering have you endured? Because of the fear that black people will take away your meager bread, your living standards have continued to decline. Millions of our own young people have lost their lives in racial wars on both sides.
    My white brothers and sisters, it would be different if you understood that it is not we black people who cause your poverty and suffering, but the Wall Street tycoons who exploit both of us. It is they who make us hate each other, not letting us know that neither of us should bear any responsibility, not letting us know that our mutual suspicion will bring them greater benefits. Careful study can reveal that we are both on the verge of poverty; if both sides can understand this fact, we can unite and take action. This is the real reason for prejudice and hatred, and the wealthy reap the benefits. If we can unite and attack this common scourge, we will both achieve the same happy life as the people of New China.
    Under the current system, we can unite and seek peaceful development of our country, and establish friendly relations with all countries regardless of their political systems. This is not only in our interest, but also in your interest. We will both benefit from this approach.
    I believe that quickly ending the Korean War is the first step. I ask our government to consult with the other four major powers to resolve all existing differences, and then people at home, regardless of race and religion, will cooperate to improve the living standards of all people.
    We have found the key to solving the problem. We have industrial strength. Let us shift from military production to production that meets human needs, from the power of destruction to the power of construction. This will ensure a peaceful and happy life for all mankind and our descendants.

    一个美国黑人看新中国的少数民族情况
    美国　路易士·惠吞
    我是美国最大的少数民族的成员之一。我们是人口有一千五百万、大部分居住在美国南部的黑种人少数民族，我们所居住的地区被叫做“黑人带”。那里是一片农业区。在那里，黑种人遭受深重的苦难。
    我的父母生长在美国南部，而我也和我的父母一样是在南部被抚养和教育长大的。我不仅亲身体验到黑种人的苦难，而且从曾祖父母、祖父母和父母所讲述的故事了解到那一切。
    我也了解美国的印第安人、墨西哥人、波多黎各人、犹太人、亚洲人、爱尔兰人、意大利人等等少数民族所遭受的苦难。在长时期中，美国统治阶级以分而治之的政策，从这些少数民族的身上获得了巨额的利润，而使少数民族仅仅能够勉强餬口。
    民族的对立是以种族优越的理论为藉口造成的。多数民族的人，从会说话时起，就受着种族歧视的教育，一直到他们离开世界。他们并根据肤色、语言和风俗的差异把一个少数民族和别的一个少数民族分化开来。除此之外，更故意捏造各种滥调，企图使美国人民确信他们对少数民族的歧视是合情合理的。
    这种恶习渗入到美国生活的各个方面，成为统治阶级获致巨额利润的源泉。这些利润是靠公开的或隐蔽的离间计谋而从各少数民族、特别是黑种人身上榨取贱价的劳动力得来的。
    正因为我在美国深受民族歧视政策的苦难，到了中国，我就很自然地关心到中国少数民族的境况；在许多情况下，使我深受感动。
    在中国，我感觉到兄弟般的情谊，感觉到我是人类大家庭中的一分子。人们并不因为我是黑人而另眼相看。我很少想起自己黑色的皮肤。中国多数民族对少数民族的特殊照顾，深深引起了我的兴趣。正因为这些少数民族过去遭受过压迫，所以他们现在获得了比多数民族更多的特别照顾。人们自觉地努力使少数民族提高到与多数民族同等的地位，尤其注意到少数民族的全部幸福。
    当然，我并不是说当我走到人们从前没有看见过黑人的地方，我也不会引起人们的注意。有大群的人围起来看我，抚摸我的皮肤和我的毛发，和我交谈。但是这些人和美国国内的人，态度是迥然不同的。在这里，有的是温暖，是伟大的友谊的感情。这种感情我从前几乎是只有在黑人之中才感受过。这里没有仇视的眼光，没有敌意，没有势利的或者轻蔑的表情。我对于这些异族人民的这种感情，无法表达我得到多大的慰藉。这种伟大的友谊的感情，对于全人类来说，这真是一种希望，一种鼓舞。
    在中国，当你踏上公共汽车或电车的时候，人们并不像在纽约和美国其他各地仿佛遇到患瘟疫或癞病的病人那样远远地闪避开你。没有人因了你的皮肤颜色的异样而拒绝坐在你的身旁。在饭店、旅馆和医院里，不管你来自北方或南方、东方或西方，没有任何待遇上的差别。
    在东北的工业区，我看到少数民族的人民在各种工业部门里工作，他们担任着经理、管理员以及技术人员或者一般的职务。在大规模的训练班里，少数民族工人被培养成熟练的技工，劳动模范之中有许多人都是来自各个少数民族的。在就业上，没有种族歧视。许多过去被关在家里的少数民族妇女，现在出头露面，为中国的工业化贡献她们的力量。中国的少数民族，不像美国的黑人、墨西哥人、波多黎各人那样地被指定专从事于特种的职业；各种各类的职业都为他们而开放，他们和多数民族站在完全平等的地位上进行工作。
    中国在过去一直是这样的吗？当然不是的。在一九四九年解放之前的长时期中，中国实行着和美国相类似的种族压迫和剥削的可怕制度，统治者在各个民族之间酿成经常的纷争，以便更有利于他们进行剥削。专制帝王、地主和统治集团专门在少数民族之间散播偏见和仇视的种子，而擅长于挑起民族纷争毒恶伎俩的美、英帝国主义者，更对这种种族压迫的残暴行径加以煽动和帮忙。
    由于这样的做法，许多的少数民族整个地濒于灭亡。居住在美国的人们将因此而联想起人口迅速减少的美国印第安人。疾病的蔓延，卫生设备、适当食物和学校教育的缺乏，以及社会和政治权利的丧失，造成了印第安人减少的原因。印第安人每年的死亡率大大超过了出生率，逐渐趋于灭亡。对待印第安人听凭其死亡消灭，是一种违反人道的罪行。
    新中国的人民政府颁布了法令，使全部少数民族享受到和其他人民完全平等的一切权利。人民政府并贯彻了这种法令，帮助各个少数民族建立起自己的区域自治政府。在中华人民共和国毛泽东主席领导之下，六十多个少数民族正在异常迅速地向前迈进。多数民族在密切关注着少数民族的文化以及他们的生长和发展，尽力帮助提高他们的生活水平和知识水平。少数民族不再觉得和多数民族疏远和隔绝。他们感到是在一个快乐大家庭中，为了伟大祖国的工业化而奋斗。
    换句话说，新中国已经在全国范围内获致了和平，各族人民已经团结在一起，而这种紧密的团结带来了新的力量，使中国将在极短期内实现工业化。值得注意的是，这种团结，这种兄弟般的情谊，是经由和平与互让的途径取得的。正是这种和平的态度和政策使我受到厚待，它显示出中国人民对于世界各个国家和人民的和平政策。不可能在国内实行一种政策，而在国外又实行另外的一种政策的。任何国家的国内政策反映于对外政策之中，因为它们是互相关连，彼此依赖的。
    我们不妨以这样的观点来考察一下我在中国所见到的一些事物，就是中华人民共和国的这种国内政策反映了它的外交政策。
    以鄂伦春少数民族为例。今天，他们在享受着幸福的生活。他们在解放前过的是怎样的生活呢？他们困居在森林之中，以打猎为业，被人叫做“野人”。在整整一世纪里，他们遭到了野蛮的压迫，而濒于灭种。解放前，他们依靠猎物维持着生活，一年到头穿戴着皮毛。当时不法的商人，勾结了反动的统治者，对他们实行着掠夺，硬逼他们以异常低廉的价格出卖贵重的皮毛。吸食鸦片受到公开而广泛的鼓励。
    现在，鄂伦春民族有了自己的政府，主掌了自己的命运。一九五一年九月建立了鄂伦春民族自治区，这样就立即使得衰退的趋势一变而为蒸蒸日上。可是他们的人口一共才不过两千余人，半数住在自治区，半数住在邻近的地区。
    他们成立了三所合作社，拥有六百二十四名社员。合作社出售着食物、枪枝和布匹，并以非常合理的价格收购猎物、皮毛和其他产品。一九五二年头九个月的营业总额，相当于一九五○年全年的十五倍。鄂伦春人民不再把棉布和美好的食品看做是稀罕难得的东西了。食粮和其他物品运到森林里去，使猎人省了远途跋涉的辛劳。
    随着政治权利的恢复和生活情况的逐步改善，鄂伦春族解放前年年减少的人口，已经开始增加。人们也戒绝了吸食鸦片的恶习。他们成立了一处医务所，在峰峦重叠的兴安岭山中，医生和护士们进行着经常的巡回诊疗，对往昔蔓延不已的疾病展开了斗争。一九五二年，百分之八十的人口种了牛痘，防止了在森林区内为害已久的天花。解放时，鄂伦春族中的文盲，占全部人口百分之九十七。现在，儿童们获得政府的津贴，学生们也得到津贴而到内蒙其他地区的小学和中学去读书。自治区政府并成立了训练班，为自治区所必需进行的各项工作训练人才。值得注意的是，不少猎人已经放弃了游牧的生活，转向从事于耕种。他们在辽阔的山区里防范着森林火灾的积极行动，也表现出他们的政治觉悟程度上的提高。
    我们再看一下西南。那里居住着各少数民族的一千八百万人民，人民政府采取种种方法大力提高了他们的农业生产水平。今年，一百三十五万件本国、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和匈牙利制造的农具，已经运送到这一少数民族地区，三年内便消除了农具缺乏的现象。
    已往由于缺乏灌溉设备而招致了经常的歉收，现在这种工程已经着手进行。仅在一个县，人民政府就为此目的而拨款二亿七千万元。通过了政府的这一帮助，傣、倮?和阿西各族人民已经兴建了四百三十七处灌溉设备和二百四十公里长的灌溉河渠。许多农业技术站和国营农场已经为少数民族建立了起来。
    今年年初，在北京为招待少数民族代表访问团而举行的一个欢迎会上，教育部部长张奚若说：“为了国家建设的需要和实现共同纲领中的民族政策，各级人民政府很重视培养民族干部的工作。”在过去三年中，中央人民政府成立了民族学院九所以及开办了许多的各民族干部训练班。现在全国已培养七万多名少数民族干部。本年内少数民族地区的教育设备将大大扩充。
    在维吾尔族占全部人口百分之八十以上的中国西北边境的新疆，七十八个县城现在几乎有半数已经开办了维吾尔文电报。维吾尔民族的人民能用自己的文字拍发出电报，这在历史上还是第一次。
    为了满足西北少数民族日益迫切的学习文化的需要，已有数十万册用各种少数民族文字编著的教科书出版。仅新疆人民出版社一家，就出版了七十万册维吾尔文、哈萨克文、蒙古文的教科书。
    我立即联想起在美国对待波多黎各人的政策。美国人不仅轻视他们的文化，而且强迫他们使用英文。由于人民决心要保存民族的和文化的个性及其遗产，西班牙文才得保留为波多黎各的语文。美国从未考虑过如何保存少数民族的文化遗产，而现在所残存的一些文化，仅是由于少数民族为了保持本身特有文化的骄傲和尊严而进行斗争的结果。在美国一般的做法，就是把一切认为不是“美国的”东西都说成是卑贱，下等和不值一顾的。我们要向中国学习怎样尊重各国人民的权利和文化遗产并帮助他们加以发展。
    在甘肃、青海、新疆三省边界地区少数民族会议上，做出了对该地区三千个哈萨克族人民进行实际帮助的决定。他们将获得贷款以从事建造房屋，发展安定的生活并建立自己的自治区政府。
    在藏族自治区首府拉萨，所计划的公共建筑物已经开始建造。这些新建筑物所占的总面积约达一万六千平方公尺，这包括最新式设备的电影院一座、牛瘟疫苗制造厂一所以及政府机关的房屋、工人的住宅和学校的房舍。驻在西藏的人民解放军部队供给藏族农民的贷款，本年将为去年的十六倍。
    尊重少数民族的宗教，是尊重少数民族另一方面的表现。在北京和全国举行的会议里，对于参加开会的人民所信仰的宗教，都加以明确的调查，为了适应代表们宗教上的需要而进行着特殊的布置。北京饭店内为回族人民建立了专用的厨房。
    六月十四日在迪化举行的维吾尔族、回族、哈萨克族、乌兹别克族、塔塔尔族、塔吉克族等少数民族回教徒参加的“开斋节”庆祝典礼，是一件令人愉快的事情。清晨，四十六座清真寺同时举行了礼拜，仪式终止后，大街上穿着节日盛装的人们川流不息，彼此互相拜访和祝贺。上午十时，省人民政府举行了庆祝会，领导干部、各清真寺阿訇、各党政机关的代表都出席参加。
    由此可见，中华人民共和国所实行的政策，是全体人民不论种族和民族的区别一律平等的真正民主政策。除此以外，也可以由此看出，中国所实行的政策，是为人民的幸福而进行和平经济建设的政策。
    我断言惟有不讲道理的人才会得出这样的结论，认为实行这样一种政策的中国会执行一种对外的侵略政策。正确的答案恰恰相反。中国在国内所实行的正是中国领袖在外交政策上所坚持的同一主张，也就是，国际的友谊，各国人民互相尊重各自的权益以及在平等互利的基础上进行经济、文化的交流。
    中国人民所制定的纲领是和平的纲领，是为增进中国人民福利和改善生活条件而拟订的纲领，是主张各国人民不分民族、不分政治制度而和平共处的纲领。这样的纲领需要和平，以争取这一政策确能产生的成果，也就是世界人民和平共处的成果。
    我确信美国需要学习中国对待少数民族的政策。长期流传的偏见和仇恨等等胡说已经彻底被驳倒，数世纪来互相残杀的人民，现已获得和平幸福的生活。
    过去在中国受到歧视的少数民族，现在获得了厚待。虽然中国的少数民族仅占全国人口的十四分之一，但在即将召开的全国人民代表大会中，少数民族占了一百五十个席位（约为全部席位总数的八分之一）。因为其他地区的少数民族仍有当选的权利，所以在这一重要会议中，他们所占的席位估计可达七分之一。我们看一看美国的情形吧，美国的黑人占全国人口十分之一，但九十八名参议员之中没有一个是黑人，三百多名众议员中仅有两名黑人。印第安人、墨西哥人、波多黎各人和其他少数民族则连一个众议员都没有。在大多数的地方议会之中，少数民族没有取得足数的代表席位，而且大多数是根本没有代表。
    我要求美国人民，尤其是白人兄弟姐妹，严肃地考虑这一问题，加以研究与探讨，以求得真确的结论。我尤其提请长期被愚弄而受毒害的南部穷苦的白人兄弟注意。你们蒙受了怎样的痛苦？由于疑惧黑人会夺去你们的微少的面包，结果你们的生活水平不断地下降。我们双方在种族战争中丧失了千百万自己的青年。
    我的白人兄弟姐妹们，如果你们了解造成你们的贫穷与痛苦的并非是我们黑人而是剥削着我们双方的华尔街财阀们，这就会不同了。正是他们使我们互相仇视，不让我们知道我们双方都不应负任何的责任，不让我们知道我们相互间的猜疑会为他们带来更大的利益，细心的研究便能揭露我们双方都同样地濒于贫困的边缘；如果双方能了解到这一事实，便可以团结起来而有所作为。这是偏见与仇视的真正原因，富豪们则坐收渔人之利。如果我们能团结一致而向这一共同的祸患施行进攻，我们双方将取得和新中国人民同样快乐的生活。
    在现行制度下，我们可以团结一致而谋求我们国家的和平发展，并和世界各国不论它们政治制度的不同而建立友好的关系。这不仅符合于我们的利益，而且也符合你们的利益。我们将因这一方针而同蒙其利。
    我以为迅速停止朝鲜战争是第一个步骤。要求我们的政府与其他四大国进行协商以图解决一切现存的歧见，然后国内人民不分种族和宗教共同合作，以求提高全体人民的生活水平。
    我们已经找到解决问题的关键。我们具有工业的力量。让我们由军事生产转为满足人类需求的生产，由破坏的力量一变而成建设的力量。这将使全人类和我们后代的和平快乐的生活得到保证。
