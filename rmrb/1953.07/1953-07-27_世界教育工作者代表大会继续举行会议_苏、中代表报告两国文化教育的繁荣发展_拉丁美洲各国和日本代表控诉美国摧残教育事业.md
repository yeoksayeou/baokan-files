Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 26th. The World Educators' Conference is continuing in Vienna. The conference is continuing to discuss the report by Paul Delanoue, General Secretary of the World Federation of Teachers' Unions, on the first item on the agenda, and listened to and discussed the reports by Henri Wallon, President of the World Federation of Teachers' Unions, and Professor Banfi of Italy on the educational principles of democratic education for young people.

During the discussion of Delanoue's report at the evening session on the 21st, Professor Raúl Valenzuela, President of the Chilean Teachers' Association, spoke on behalf of the Latin American delegations. He said that the economic dependence of Latin American countries on the United States has plunged the vast majority of the people into extreme poverty and has led to the decline of national culture. Seventy-five percent of the population of Bolivia is illiterate, and illiteracy in Haiti accounts for 80 percent of the population. The number of schools in Latin American countries is less than half the number needed, and there are also half as many teachers. In countries such as Chile, Paraguay, and Argentina, most of the funds that should be used for national education are used for military spending. He concluded by saying: Teachers in Latin American countries are fighting for peace, democracy, and national independence, and they are preparing for the Latin American Educators' Conference to be held in Uruguay next year.

At the meeting on the 22nd, Algerian representative Faraji reported on the educational situation in Algeria, saying that only 13 percent of the children can attend primary school, and very few can enter higher education. The courses in the schools are taught in French, and the French colonialists are trying to stifle the national culture of the Algerian people. Teachers who educate children in the spirit of patriotism and peace are severely persecuted. He went on to say that the situation is similar in Tunisia, Morocco, and other African countries. Educators in these countries, together with all the people, are resolutely rising up to fight for national independence and peace, and to achieve universal democratic education.

I. Grifkov, head of the Soviet delegation, illustrated the flourishing development of Soviet culture and the service of Soviet education to the cause of peace with concrete facts. His words won thunderous applause from the audience.

Representatives from Mexico, Burma, Hungary, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and other countries also spoke during the discussion.

Fang Ming, head of the Chinese delegation, spoke first at the meeting on the 23rd. He used vivid and specific examples to illustrate the outstanding achievements of education in New China, saying that compared with 1946, the number of primary school students has increased by 2.3 times, the number of middle school students has increased by 1.75 times, and the number of university students has increased by 1.57 times. The living standards of teachers have been greatly improved, and they have become people who are respected by the people.

Representatives from Italy, Japan, Cyprus, and other countries also spoke at the meeting.

Henri Wallon, President of the World Federation of Teachers' Unions, and Professor Banfi of Italy, respectively, gave reports on the educational principles of democratic education for young people. Banfi concluded, based on his thorough analysis, that Western education is in a serious crisis: millions of children are out of school, and the education system is always permeated with anti-people and reactionary ideas and theories.

In the discussion of the reports by Wallon and Banfi, Japanese representative Tokimine Ohtani said that the intensified U.S. occupation has made Japanese schools more and more reactionary and made them serve the purpose of training cannon fodder. Teachers who support peace are being dismissed. From 1946 to 1950 alone, more than 1,700 teachers were dismissed. However, Japanese teachers are still increasingly bravely demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan, national independence, and a democratic education system.

    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界教育工作者代表大会继续在维也纳举行，大会继续讨论教育工作者工会国际总书记保罗·德拉努关于第一项议程的报告，并听取和讨论了教育工作者工会国际主席亨利·伐隆和意大利的班菲教授所作的对青年进行民主教育的教育原则问题的报告。
    在二十一日晚间会议讨论德拉努的报告时，智利教师协会主席拉乌尔·瓦伦齐亚教授代表拉丁美洲各国代表团发言。他说，拉丁美洲各国对美国的经济依赖性，使广大阶层的人民陷于极度贫困，使民族文化衰落下去；玻利维亚的人口中有百分之七十五是文盲，海地的文盲占人口数百分之八十，拉丁美洲各国现有的学校数目比必需的数目少了一半以上，教师也缺少一半。在智利、巴拉圭、阿根廷等国家，本来该用于国民教育的经费，绝大部分被用到军备上去了。他最后说：拉丁美洲各国的教师们都在为争取和平民主与民族独立而斗争，他们正在筹备将于明年在乌拉圭举行的拉丁美洲教育工作者代表大会。
    在二十二日会议上，阿尔及利亚代表法拉吉在发言中报告了阿尔及利亚的教育情况，他说：当地只有百分之十三的儿童能上小学，能进高等学校的人是寥寥可数。学校里的课程，是用法语讲授的，法国殖民者企图窒息阿尔及利亚人民的民族文化，教师以爱国主义与和平的精神来教育儿童就会遭到严厉的迫害。他接着说：在突尼斯、摩洛哥和非洲其他国家，情形也是这样。这些国家的教育工作者正和全体人民一起，坚决地起来争取民族独立与和平，争取实现普遍民主的教育。
    苏联代表团团长伊·格里夫科夫以具体的事实说明了苏联文化的繁荣发展，和苏联教育为和平事业服务的情形。他的话博得了全场雷动的掌声。
    墨西哥、缅甸、匈牙利、比利时、捷克斯洛伐克等国的代表，也在讨论中发言。
    中国代表团团长方明在二十三日的会议上首先发言。他用生动的具体事例，说明了新中国教育的杰出成就，他说：和一九四六年比较，小学生人数已增加了二点三倍，中学生人数增加了一点七五倍，高等学校学生增加了一点五七倍。教师的生活水平已大大提高，他们成为被人民尊敬的人。
    意大利、日本、塞浦路斯等国代表也在会上发言。
    教育工作者工会国际主席亨利·伐隆和意大利的班菲教授分别就对青年进行民主教育的教育原则问题作报告，班菲根据他透彻的分析作出结论说：西方的教育正处于严重的危机中：千百万儿童失学，而教育制度总是渗透着反人民和反动的见解和理论。
    在讨论伐隆和班菲的报告时，日本代表大谷时岭说，美国加紧的占领统治，使日本的学校愈来愈反动，并使它们为训练炮灰的目的而服务。拥护和平的教师都被解雇，仅在一九四六年至一九五○年就有一千七百多教师被解雇。但是，日本教师仍然愈来愈勇敢地要求美军撤出日本、要求民族独立和民主教育制度。
