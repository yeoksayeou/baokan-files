Leaders of various Chinese people's organizations have issued statements supporting the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. They unanimously stated that they will continue to work hard to ensure the full implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and will devote greater enthusiasm and strength to build the motherland and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

中华全国总工会 (All-China Federation of Trade Unions)
Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, stated: The Korean War, which has been watched by the whole world, has finally come to a halt in accordance with the peaceful will of the people all over the world. This is a great victory for the people of China and North Korea, and a great victory for the peace movement. The Chinese working class cheers for this great victory, and the Chinese working class heartily congratulates the signing of the armistice agreement. Due to the persistent struggle of the Chinese and North Korean people and the people of the world for more than three years, the heinous plans of the warmongers have finally been shattered, which has left the American aggressors with no other choice but to accept the armistice. Therefore, although the aggressors were unwilling to achieve the armistice, the armistice was finally achieved. The entire negotiation process shows that the aggressors were unwilling to cease fire, but had to accept it. Because they were forced to accept the armistice, we must be vigilant at all times, to defend peace with a high degree of vigilance, to supervise the effective implementation of the armistice agreement, and to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The victory of the Korean armistice was bought with the blood of heroes. The Chinese working class will always remember the heroes who bravely sacrificed themselves to defend the motherland and peace. The patriotism and internationalism of the heroes will always be our example. During the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese working class launched a large-scale production increase and economy campaign to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. After the Korean armistice, the Chinese working class will continue to devote themselves to the construction of national defense and economic construction with selfless labor, striving to defend the motherland and complete the country's construction plan, and will continue to help the Korean people's post-war recovery work with internationalist spirit. The Chinese working class will unite more closely with the peasant brothers and the people of the whole country to strive for the realization of national industrialization.

中华全国民主妇女联合会 (All-China Democratic Women's Federation)
Zhang Yun, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, stated: The Korean Armistice Agreement, which mothers and women all over the world have been longing for, has been signed. This is a glorious victory won by the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in their resolute resistance to the aggressors, defense of peace, and persistence in more than two years of armistice negotiations. The achievement of this victory is inseparable from the Soviet government's consistent advocacy of resolving all international disputes through peaceful consultation, actively supporting the policy of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the just struggle of peace-loving people around the world for peace. We Chinese women, together with the people of the whole country, warmly support the signing of this agreement. In order to resist the war of aggression, we once encouraged our sons and husbands to go to the front line in Korea, and fully supported them. Our purpose is to oppose aggression, strive for peace, defend the motherland, and defend our homeland and peaceful life. Now we have finally won a glorious victory, forcing the instigators of the war to sign the armistice agreement. But we know deeply that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is only the beginning of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We Chinese women must, together with the Chinese and North Korean people and peace-loving people around the world, be vigilant at all times, be prepared to resolutely strike at any provocative acts of the warmongers, and strive to the end for the further realization of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The pain and disaster that the more than three years of American aggression against Korea has inflicted on the Korean people, women, and children are incalculable. We Chinese women will, together with the people of the whole country, continue to maintain and develop the internationalist spirit of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the past, help the Korean people heal the wounds of war and rebuild their homes, so that our flesh-and-blood friendship tested in the war will be more consolidated and developed. We Chinese women must, together with the people of the whole country, step up the construction of the motherland, consolidate national defense, and increase our vigilance a hundredfold. We must unite more closely with the peace-loving people and women of the world, and contribute our greater strength to the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

中华全国民主青年联合会 (All-China Federation of Democratic Youth)
Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, stated: The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a victory for the Chinese and North Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world in their struggle for peace, a victory for the spirit of consultation over force, and a victory for the struggle against aggression. The Chinese youth have always loved peace and opposed wars of aggression. For the past three years, the Chinese youth have made great efforts and fervent wishes to strive for the realization of the Korean armistice, because it is related to the lives and happiness of millions of people, and is related to the peace of the Far East and the world. Therefore, the Chinese youth warmly support the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. However, the Chinese youth clearly know that some warmongers on the American side and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang will not be reconciled to a real armistice. We must be vigilant to prevent the American side from failing to effectively implement the agreement and guarantees, and to prevent the Syngman Rhee bandit gang from undermining the armistice with the connivance of the United States. The Chinese youth are keenly concerned about the post-war life of the Korean people, and are determined to continue to help them restore production and rebuild their homes, so that millions of dear Korean brothers and sisters can live a peaceful, happy, and fulfilling life again. The Chinese youth, together with the people of the whole country, are determined to continue to fight to the end for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We must step up the economic and national defense construction of the motherland and prepare to crush any aggression by imperialism. If any warmongers dare to undermine the armistice, they will encounter even greater and more tragic failures.

中华全国学生联合会 (All-China Students' Federation)
Guan Ruoluan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, stated: Chinese students wholeheartedly support the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, believing that this agreement provides favorable conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and is the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, we also clearly see that some warmongers on the American side, especially the Syngman Rhee Group, are clamoring against the armistice. There will be many obstacles on the road to implementing the terms of the armistice agreement and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. Therefore, we Chinese students must, together with the people of the whole country and peace-loving people all over the world, be vigilant, supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement by the American government and the Syngman Rhee Group, and prevent their sabotage activities. Guan Ruoluan said: Chinese students will, together with the people of the whole country, while striving for a further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, sincerely help the heroic Korean people rebuild their homeland destroyed by American imperialism. Chinese students will study and exercise more diligently, cultivate themselves into construction talents with both moral integrity and ability and sound physique, and prepare to dedicate their greatest strength to defending and building our great motherland and striving for lasting world peace.

中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会 (Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce)
Chen Shutong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, expressed warm support for the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on behalf of the national industrial and commercial circles. He said: Through the vigorous struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea over the past three years, our industrialists and businessmen have deeply realized that striving for lasting world peace is not only a condition for the prosperity and development of our industry and commerce, but also an important condition for building our new China. In order to ensure the construction of our motherland, so that our motherland can develop and prosper in a peaceful environment, and so that the happy life of our people will not be destroyed, we must oppose paralysis and resolutely distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. We must more resolutely, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, give play to the enthusiasm for production and operation, contribute our own strength, strengthen the country's economic construction and national defense construction, and continue to assist the Korean people in restoring production, be ready at any time to completely smash all enemy conspiracies to undermine peace, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and defend peace in the Far East and the world!

中华全国文学艺术界联合会 (All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles)
The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles stated: The realization of the Korean armistice is the beginning of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement proves the invincibility of the strength of the people of China and North Korea, and also proves the unparalleled growth of world peace forces. This is a great victory for the Chinese and North Korean people and the people of the world in upholding the struggle for peace. Due to the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean people will begin to engage in the country's recovery and construction work. We, together with the people of the whole country, warmly congratulate and support them in continuing to achieve victory in the cause of national recovery and construction. However, the warmongers will not be reconciled to failure. This can be proven by the fact that the U.S. side connives at the Syngman Rhee Group's open opposition to and sabotage of the armistice. Therefore, we must be vigilant at all times and resolutely oppose any violation and sabotage of the armistice agreement. We firmly believe that all international disputes can and should be resolved through peaceful consultation. Peace will surely triumph over war!

    各人民团体负责人谈话
    我国各人民团体负责人发表谈话，拥护朝鲜停战协定的签字，他们一致表示，要继续努力，争取朝鲜停战协定的全部实施以及朝鲜问题的和平解决，并要以更大的热情和力量来建设祖国，保卫远东和世界的和平。
    中华全国总工会
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚发表谈话说：为全世界所瞩目的朝鲜战争，终于按照全世界人民的和平意志停止了。这是中、朝两国人民的伟大胜利，是和平运动的伟大胜利。中国工人阶级为这个伟大的胜利而欢呼，中国工人阶级热诚地祝贺停战协定的签订。由于朝中人民和世界人民三年多的坚持斗争，战争贩子们的罪恶计划终于被粉碎了，这就使得美国侵略者除了接受停战而外再没有其他的出路。所以，尽管侵略者不愿意实现停战，而停战还是终于实现了。整个的谈判过程说明了侵略者不愿意停战，而又不得不接受停战。正因为他们接受停战是被迫的，所以我们要时刻保持警惕，以高度的警惕来捍卫和平，来监督停战协定的切实执行，并为朝鲜问题的和平解决而努力。朝鲜停战的胜利，是英雄们的鲜血换来的。中国工人阶级永远怀念着为了保卫祖国、保卫和平而英勇牺牲的英雄们，英雄们的爱国主义、国际主义的精神永远是我们的榜样。中国工人阶级在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，曾展开了规模宏大的增产节约运动，以支援中国人民志愿军。在朝鲜停战之后，中国工人阶级将继续以忘我的劳动，致力于祖国的国防建设与经济建设，为保卫祖国和完成国家的建设计划而努力，并将继续以国际主义的精神，援助朝鲜人民战后的恢复工作。中国工人阶级将更紧密地和农民兄弟以及全国人民团结一致，为实现国家工业化而努力。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席章蕴发表谈话说：全世界母亲们、妇女们渴望已久的朝鲜停战协定已经签字了。这是英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军和中朝人民三年来坚决抵抗侵略者、保卫和平、坚持了两年多的停战谈判所获得的光荣胜利。这个胜利的获得，是和苏联政府一贯倡议以和平协商方式解决一切国际争端，积极支持和平解决朝鲜问题的政策，以及全世界爱好和平的人民争取和平的正义斗争分不开的。我们中国妇女和全国人民一起，热烈拥护这个协定的签订。为了抵抗侵略战争，我们曾经鼓励我们的儿子、丈夫到朝鲜前线，并以全力支援了他们。我们的目的，就是为了反对侵略，争取和平，保卫祖国，保卫自己的家乡与和平的生活。现在我们终于赢得了光荣的胜利，迫使战争的挑衅者不得不签订停战协定。但我们深知，签订了朝鲜停战协定，还只是和平解决朝鲜问题的一个开端。我们中国妇女要和朝中人民、全世界爱好和平的人民一起，随时提高警惕，准备对好战分子的任何挑衅行为给予坚决的打击，为进一步实现朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗到底。三年多的美国侵朝战争所加于朝鲜人民、妇女与儿童的痛苦和灾害是无法估计的。我们中国妇女将和全国人民一起，继续保持和发扬过去抗美援朝的国际主义精神，帮助朝鲜人民医治战争的创伤，重建自己的家园，使我们从战争中经过考验的血肉相联的友谊更巩固、更发展。我们中国妇女一定要和全国人民一起，更加加紧地建设祖国，巩固国防，并百倍提高警惕。我们要和全世界爱好和平的人民和妇女更紧密地团结起来，在以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营中，贡献出我们更大的力量。
    中华全国民主青年联合会
    中华全国民主青年联合会主席廖承志发表谈话说：朝鲜停战协定签字是中朝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民为和平而斗争的胜利，是协商精神战胜武力的胜利，是反对侵略的斗争的胜利。中国青年一向是热爱和平反对侵略战争的，三年来，中国青年为争取朝鲜停战的实现曾付予重大的努力和殷切的愿望，因为它关系着千百万人民的生命和幸福，关系着远东及世界的和平，因此，中国青年热烈拥护朝鲜停战协定的签订。但是，中国青年清楚地知道，美国方面的一部分好战分子和李承晚匪帮是不会甘心于真正停战的。我们必须提高警惕，防止美国方面不切实履行协定和保证，防止李承晚匪帮在美国纵容下可能对停战进行破坏。中国青年热切关怀着朝鲜人民战后的生活，决心继续帮助他们恢复生产，重建家园，让千百万亲爱的朝鲜兄弟姊妹们重过和平幸福的美满生活。中国青年和全国人民一道，决心继续为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底。我们要加紧祖国的经济建设和国防建设，准备粉碎帝国主义的任何侵略。任何好战分子如果敢于破坏停战，他们必将遭遇到更大更悲惨的失败。
    中华全国学生联合会
    中华全国学生联合会副主席关若鸾发表谈话说：中国学生衷心地拥护朝鲜停战协定的签订，认为这个协定对和平解决朝鲜问题提供了有利条件，是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。但是，我们也清楚地看到：美国方面的一部分好战分子，特别是李承晚集团正在叫嚣反对停战。在实施停战协定的条款、和平解决朝鲜问题的路途上，还会有许多障碍。因此，我们中国学生一定要和全国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民一起，提高警惕，监督美国政府和李承晚集团对朝鲜停战协定的实施，防止他们的破坏活动。关若鸾说：中国学生将和全国人民一道，在努力争取朝鲜问题进一步和平解决的同时，热诚地帮助英雄的朝鲜人民重建他们遭受美帝国主义破坏的家园。中国学生将更加努力地学习和锻炼身体，培养自己成为德才兼备、体魄健全的建设人才，准备为保卫和建设我们伟大的祖国，为争取世界持久和平，献出自己最大的力量。
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会主任委员陈叔通在谈话中代表全国工商界对于朝鲜停战协定的签订，表示热烈的拥护与支持。他说：经过三年来全国人民轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝的斗争，我们工商业者都深刻认识到：争取世界持久和平不仅是我们工商业繁荣发展的条件，同时更是建设我们新中国的重要条件。为着确保我们祖国的建设，为着我们的祖国能在和平环境中发展与繁荣，为着使我国人民的幸福生活不受破坏，我们必须反对麻痹，必须坚决分清敌我。我们要更坚决地和全国人民一道，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，发挥生产经营的积极性，贡献自己的力量，加强祖国经济建设和国防建设，并继续援助朝鲜人民恢复生产，随时准备彻底粉碎敌人的一切破坏和平的阴谋，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，保卫远东与世界和平而奋斗！
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会负责人发表谈话说：朝鲜停战的实现，是朝鲜问题和平解决的开端。朝鲜停战协定的签字，证明了朝中两国人民力量的不可欺侮，同时也证明了世界和平力量的无比壮大。这是中朝人民以及世界人民坚持和平斗争的伟大胜利。由于朝鲜停战协定的签字，朝鲜人民将开始从事国家的恢复和建设工作，我们和全国人民一同热烈祝贺并支持他们在国家恢复和建设事业中继续取得胜利。但是，好战分子是不会甘心失败的。从美方纵容李承晚集团公开反对并破坏停战这一事实就可以得到证明。因此，我们必须时时刻刻提高警惕，坚决反对对于停战协定的任何的违反和破坏。我们坚信：一切国际争端是可以而且应该用和平协商的方法来解决的。和平必定战胜战争！
