Establishing New Culture and Art on the Basis of National Cultural Traditions
— Observations on the Culture and Art of Eastern European People's Democratic Countries
Deputy Head of the Cultural and Educational Delegation to Eastern European People's Democratic Countries Peng Kang

    After completing their recovery work, the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries have entered the stage of building socialism and have achieved remarkable results. Due to the great development of the economy, the people's living standards are constantly improving; in this way, the labor enthusiasm of the working people has been further encouraged, and they clearly see their bright future. Therefore, a new atmosphere is emerging in these countries. This situation naturally promotes the growth of people's cultural demands, and economic development provides conditions for cultural development. At the same time, in socialist construction, the purpose of economic construction is to meet the material and cultural needs of society. Therefore, the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries are developing cultural construction in coordination with the development of economic construction. This culture is a new culture, a socialist culture, a culture with national forms and socialist content. This new culture serves the people and inherits the cultural traditions of its own nation. The Eastern European People's Democratic Countries all have their own excellent cultural traditions, the people's cultural level is relatively high, cultural life is relatively popular, and they have the advanced socialist culture of the Soviet Union as an example. Therefore, they are building their own new culture that serves the people by carrying forward national cultural traditions, learning from the Soviet Union, and absorbing the good things from the classical cultures of other countries.

    The Eastern European People's Democratic Countries do not adopt a completely negative attitude towards their own classical culture. On the contrary, they cherish the national classical culture very much. They believe that classical culture is the precious cultural property of their own nation, the creation of their own nation in historical development, which embodies the wisdom and genius of their own nation, and contains the feelings of their own nation. However, they do not want to restore the old, nor do they advocate national essence-ism, but rather use the Marxist point of view to analyze and study classical culture, and absorb the progressive, democratic, and scientific things in it as elements of creation. They use this to publicize to the people, so that the masses of the people can correctly understand the historical culture of their own nation, and regard this kind of propaganda as a kind of patriotic education for the masses of the people. The Eastern European People's Democratic Countries have done a lot of work in this regard, studying the life, thoughts, and works of historical writers and artists; publishing their works; staging their programs (dramas, operas, music, etc.); exhibiting the paintings of painters; holding memorial meetings for them, such as "Goethe Year," "Bach Year," and the memorial meeting for the musician Smetana held in Czechoslovakia; preserving their former residences as museums, such as Chopin's former residence in Poland, Goethe and Schiller's former residences in Germany, Botev and Vazov's former residences in Bulgaria, etc.; making films of their lives, such as "The Life of Chopin" in Poland and the life of the Hungarian musician "Erkel," as well as making films of painters' paintings, such as the paintings of the Hungarian painter Munkácsy, etc. In addition, the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries also cherish cultural relics and historical sites very much, and carefully protect ancient buildings. For example, Bulgaria preserves the town of Koprivshtitsa as a museum of national architectural art. Some particularly famous buildings have been damaged and are restored to their original appearance, such as the Zwinger Palace in Dresden, Germany, and the Pod Blachą Palace in Warsaw, Poland.

    Another aspect of preserving national cultural traditions is folk art. The Eastern European People's Democratic Countries all have rich and diverse folk arts, mainly music, dance, handicrafts, folk buildings, etc. These folk arts are rooted in the people and are familiar to the broad masses of the people. They can not only enrich the cultural life of the masses, but also have been tools for awakening national consciousness and communicating national feelings to resist foreign rule (the situation in Germany is different). Therefore, the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries all regard the preservation, research, and development of folk art as an important work with guiding principles. These countries collect all kinds of folk arts, both widely spread and not widely spread, and even those that are about to be forgotten, from all regions of the country, and study them from both ideological and artistic perspectives. They conduct comprehensive research on a piece of music or a dance from its entire spirit, mood, and expression methods, and also conduct analytical research on each melody or each movement. In this way, they extract the healthy elements that can express national feelings and are suitable for expressing real life as the basis for creative processing. After such research and processing, the new creation is an art that has been improved on the original basis. In order to carry out such research work, countries such as Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria all have specialized institutions - the Folk Art Research Institute. This institution is only responsible for collecting, preserving, and researching, providing materials for writers, and does not organize creation itself. They believe that separating research work from processing and creation can strengthen the research work of folk art, and the strengthening of research work provides favorable conditions for creation.

    In order to more widely carry out mass literary and artistic activities and popularize the art that has been processed and improved to the masses, these countries have universally organized mass amateur literary and artistic groups and educational institutions, such as song and dance troupes, drama troupes, choirs, orchestras, amateur music schools, dance schools, etc.; literary and artistic workers provide guidance, and the state organizes these amateur literary and artistic groups to perform at certain times, selects excellent works for research and promotion; excellent performers are sent to various art schools to study for further education and become professional literary and artistic workers; some are concentrated and trained to become national song and dance troupes. For example, the "Hungarian State Folk Song and Dance Ensemble" and the "Polish Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble," which have been to China, were formed in this way.

    The new cultural construction of the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries takes the advanced socialist culture of the Soviet Union as an example. Therefore, they study the experience of the Soviet Union very seriously. Their methods are: 1. Systematically study the advanced Soviet artistic theories and literary and artistic policies; 2. Regularly study the creative methods of socialist realism through the study of Soviet works; 3. Learn the organizational experience and working methods of Soviet literary and artistic work in combination with actual conditions; 4. Plan to translate, introduce, and stage Soviet works to conduct art education for the masses; and send literary and artistic workers—actors, dancers, musicians, painters, etc.—to the Soviet Union to study. For example, the national dance in the teaching plan of the Czechoslovakian dance school, based on the Soviet experience, first studies the dances of various regions of its own nation, and then studies the dances of fraternal nations, such as Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, and Bulgarian dances, and studies the similarities and differences among them, which is of great benefit to improving the dances of its own nation. For example, actors studying at Soviet dance schools in Hungary return to China for performances every year for a certain period of time to introduce their learning experiences and can combine them with the domestic art life. According to Soviet experience, the students of art schools in these countries are selected from amateur art schools and amateur literary and artistic groups to ensure that people with artistic talents among the masses have the opportunity for further study. A very excellent ballet dancer in Romania was promoted from railway workers.

    While learning from the Soviet Union, the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries do not refuse to accept the artistic heritage of Russia and other countries around the world, and absorb the progressive and realistic elements among them. For example, studying the works of masters such as Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, and Bach in music schools is still an important part of the teaching plan. Classical works also account for a certain proportion in the performance plan. Among classical works, Russian classical works account for the largest proportion.

    When solving the problem of popularization and improvement, the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries have adopted the policy of "eliminating boundaries and not equating," as proposed by Poland. This means that the improved things should not be separated from the masses, and they are also taken from folk and classical sources, so there should be no essential difference between it and the popularized things. It's just that one is improved and processed, and refined; the other is relatively simple, but not refined enough. Just as there is no essential difference between Russian folk songs and Tchaikovsky's symphonies. The cooperation between folk art research institutions and writers, painters, musicians, and dancers in these countries is to solve this problem. The Bulgarian opera "Song of the Brave," the Romanian "Miner Symphony," and the Hungarian ballet "Headscarf" are good attempts to solve the problem of improvement and popularization. These improved things are familiar to the masses and are processed and refined, and are warmly welcomed by the masses.

    Since the old writers and artists of the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries were deeply poisoned by Western cosmopolitanism, in the cultural and artistic circles of these countries, in the construction of new culture and art, there are generally two contradictions: one is the contradiction between the socialist task and the remnants of the bourgeois ideology of literary and artistic workers, and the other is the contradiction between the socialist content and the formalist creative methods. In order to solve these two contradictions, these countries have carried out ideological transformation work for literary and artistic workers. This work is carried out in three aspects: 1. Carry out systematic theoretical education of Marxism-Leninism. Writers and artists in these countries have systematically studied the basics of Marxism-Leninism and the aesthetic views of Marxism-Leninism in night universities or night party schools to overcome their cosmopolitan errors. This kind of learning takes a long time to be effective, but it is the fundamental way to solve ideological problems. 2. Carry out work discussions, hold exhibitions, criticize works, compare works, criticize ideas from works, point out the good and bad and differences between realism and formalism, and draw conclusions for everyone to learn. We visited art exhibitions in various countries many times. The works, whether good or bad, were all displayed to solicit opinions from the masses, and comparative discussions were held during the exhibition to conduct education through the works. Because they believe that if they cannot use works to illustrate, then the so-called socialist realism as the best creative method cannot be believed by people. Hungary organized three major debates in the literary and artistic circles after liberation. The first was to oppose the literary and artistic thought of "art for art's sake" and open up the road to socialist realism. This debate pointed out the correct direction for young writers, making them realize that the task of literature and art is to serve national construction and to help the party educate and transform the masses. After the debate, the Democratic Writers Association was established, and many writers began to learn to reflect real life. The second was to oppose formalism. At that time, the masses of the people liked to read the works of Soviet writers, but did not like to read the works of Hungarian writers, because these Hungarian works did not reflect the living reality. The images in them were just the personification of political slogans, or, as they said, fairy-tale slogans with two legs. The third was to oppose the mood of decadence. At that time, some writers, under the pretext of opposing formalism, created works that distorted reality. They praised death, praised loneliness, and were full of decadent emotions. This debate strictly criticized this emotion and advocated healthy realism that could truly reflect real life. The above three debates were all carried out in conjunction with the criticism of works, so they achieved great results. 3. Encourage creation, ensure the life of writers, and give national awards to writers who have contributed and created good works. For example, Poland and Germany have national prizes, and Bulgaria has the Dimitrov prize. Outstanding writers and artists are awarded honorary titles, such as honorary artists and people's artists. Government cultural departments and writers sign creation contracts, the state establishes creation funds, and provides all conveniences for creation. The Eastern European People's Democratic Countries use these methods to guide and help literary and art workers to carry out ideological transformation. However, ideological transformation cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, the policy they adopt towards literary and art workers is a firm transformation, sincere help, and patient waiting. Due to the adoption of such policies and the above methods, the thinking of literary artists in the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries has been greatly improved. In the entire cultural and artistic circles, the idea of serving the people and the creative method of socialist realism have become the dominant guiding principles.

    在民族文化传统的基础上建立新的文化艺术
    ——东欧人民民主国家文化艺术观感
    赴东欧人民民主国家文化教育考察团副团长  彭康
    东欧人民民主国家在完成了恢复工作以后，已经进入建设社会主义的阶段，并已获得显著成绩。由于经济有了很大的发展，人民生活在不断地提高；这样，劳动人民的劳动热情就更加得到鼓舞，他们清楚地看到自己光明的前途，因而在这些国家里呈现着一片新气象。这种情形自然就促进了人民对文化要求的增长，而经济的发展也就提供了文化发展的条件；同时，在社会主义建设中，经济建设的目的，也就是为了要满足社会的物质和文化的需要，所以东欧人民民主国家在发展经济建设的同时，相适应地发展着文化建设。这种文化是一种新的文化，社会主义的文化，民族形式、社会主义内容的文化。这种新文化是为人民服务的，是继承了自己民族文化传统的。东欧人民民主国家都有自己的优秀文化传统，人民的文化水平较高，文化生活比较普及，又有苏联社会主义的先进文化作榜样，所以他们是在发扬民族文化传统的基础上，学习苏联，并吸收其他国家古典文化中的好的东西，来建设自己为人民服务的新文化的。
    东欧人民民主国家对自己的古典文化并不采取一概抹煞的态度，相反地，他们十分珍视民族的古典文化。他们认为古典文化是自己民族的宝贵的文化财产，是自己民族在历史发展中的创造，在这里面表现着自己民族的智慧和天才，蕴藏着自己民族的感情；但他们并不要复古，也不是主张国粹主义，而是要以马克思主义的观点对古典文化加以分析研究，吸取其中进步的、民主的和科学的东西作为创作的要素；并以此向人民宣传，使人民群众正确地认识自己民族的历史文化，并把这种宣传作为向人民群众进行的一种爱国主义教育。东欧人民民主国家在这方面是作了许多工作的，研究历史上的作家和艺术家的生平、思想及作品；出版他们的著作；上演他们的节目（戏剧、歌剧、音乐等）；展览画家的画；举行纪念他们的纪念会，如“歌德年”、“巴哈年”和捷克斯洛伐克举行的音乐家斯麦塔纳的纪念会；把他们的故居作为博物馆保存起来，如波兰的萧邦故居、德国的歌德和席勒的故居、保加利亚的波特夫和伐佐夫的故居等；把他们的生平摄成电影，如波兰的“萧邦的生平”和匈牙利的音乐家“爱尔克尔生平”，以及把画家的画摄成电影，如匈牙利画家蒙卡奇的画等。此外，东欧人民民主国家对文物古迹也十分珍视，对古代建筑加以细心保护，如保加利亚将柯普里夫什提查城作为民族建筑艺术博物馆保存起来；有些特别著名的建筑物遭受破坏，便照原样恢复起来，如德国德列斯登的翠英格耳宫，波兰华沙的波德布拉查宫。
    保存着民族文化传统的另一个方面是民间艺术。东欧人民民主国家都有丰富多样的民间艺术，主要是音乐、舞蹈以及手工艺、民间建筑物等。这些民间艺术生根在人民之中，为广大人民群众所熟悉，它们不但可以充实人民群众的文化生活，而且曾是唤醒民族意识，沟通民族感情以反抗异族统治的工具（德国情形不同）；所以东欧人民民主国家都把保存、研究和发扬民间艺术当作带方针性的重要工作。这些国家对国内各个地区的，普遍流传和流传不广的，甚至将被遗忘的各种样式的民间艺术都搜集起来，从思想性和艺术性两方面加以研究，将
    一支乐曲或一个舞蹈，从其整个精神、情调和表现方法加以综合的研究，也从每个旋律或每个动作加以分析的研究，这样取出其中健康的，足以表现民族感情的和适合于表现现实生活的要素，作为创作加工的基础。经过这样的研究和加工，新的创作便是在原有基础上提高了的艺术了。为了进行这样的研究工作，匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚等国家，都有专门的机构——民间艺术研究所。这个机构只负责搜集、保存和研究，供给作家材料，自身并不组织创作。他们认为将研究工作和加工创造进行分工，可以加强民间艺术的研究工作，而研究工作的加强，给创作提供了有利的条件。
    为了更广泛地开展群众性的文艺活动，并把加工提高了的艺术普及到人民群众中去，这些国家都普遍组织了群众性的业余文艺团体及教育机关，如歌舞团，剧团，歌唱队，乐队，业余音乐学校，舞蹈学校等；由文艺工作者加以指导，并由国家在一定时期组织这些业余文艺团体会演，选择其中优秀的作品加以研究推广；优秀的演出者送到各种艺术学校学习，以资深造，成为专业文艺工作者；有的则集中起来加以训练成为国家歌舞团。如到中国来过的
    “匈牙利国家人民歌舞团”及“波兰玛佐夫舍歌舞团”就是这样组成的。
    东欧人民民主国家的新文化建设，是以苏联社会主义的先进文化为榜样的。所以他们十分认真学习苏联的经验。他们的办法是：一、系统地研究苏联的先进艺术理论及文艺政策；二、经常地通过研究苏联作品学习社会主义现实主义的创作方法；三、结合实际地学习苏联文艺工作的组织经验及工作方法；四、有计划地翻译介绍上演苏联作品，向群众进行艺术教育；派文艺工作者——演员、舞蹈家、音乐家、画家等到苏联学习。例如，捷克斯洛伐克的舞蹈学校的教学计划中的民族舞蹈，根据苏联的经验，先学习本民族各地区的舞蹈，然后学习兄弟民族，如波兰、乌克兰、俄罗斯、保加利亚的舞蹈，研究其中的异同，对提高本民族的舞蹈有很大好处。又例如，匈牙利在苏联舞蹈学校学习的演员，每年有一定时间回国演出，以介绍学习心得，并可以和国内的艺术生活结合。这些国家的艺术学校的学生，根据苏联经验，是由业余艺术学校，业余文艺团体中选拔的，以保证群众中有艺术才能的人有深造的机会。罗马尼亚的一个很优秀的巴蕾舞演员就是由铁路工人中提拔出来的。
    东欧各人民民主国家在学习苏联的同时，并不拒绝接受俄罗斯及世界各国的艺术遗产，吸取其中进步的，现实主义的因素。如在音乐学校学习贝多芬、柴可夫斯基、萧邦、巴哈等大师的作品，仍然是教学计划中的重要部分。在上演计划中，古典作品也占有一定的比例。在古典作品中，俄罗斯古典作品占的比重最大。
    在解决普及和提高的问题时，东欧各人民民主国家是采取了像波兰所提出的“消除界线，不划等号”的方针。这就是说，提高的东西不应该是脱离群众的，它也是取之于民间和古典的，因此它和普及的东西不应该有本质上的差别。只不过一个是提高了的加工了的，是洗炼了的；另一个则是比较朴素的，但还不够洗炼。正如俄罗斯的民歌和柴可夫斯基的交响乐并没有本质上的差别一样。这些国家的民间艺术研究机关和作家、画家、音乐家、舞蹈家的合作，就是为了解决这一问题的。保加利亚的歌舞剧“勇士之歌”，罗马尼亚的“矿工交响乐”，匈牙利的巴蕾舞剧“头巾”，就是解决提高和普及问题的很好的尝试。这些提高了的东西都是群众所熟悉的，又是加工洗炼的，受到了群众热烈的欢迎。
    由于东欧各人民民主国家的旧作家，艺术家受西方世界主义思想毒害较深，所以，在这些国家的文化艺术界，在新的文化艺术的建设中，普遍存在着两个矛盾：这就是社会主义的任务和文艺工作者资产阶级思想残余之间的矛盾，以及社会主义内容及形式主义创作方法之间的矛盾。为了解决这两个矛盾，这些国家都进行了文艺工作者的思想改造工作。这一工作是从三方面来进行的：一、进行系统的马克思、列宁主义的理论教育。这些国家的作家，艺术家都已进夜大学或夜党校有系统地学习马克思、列宁主义基础及马克思、列宁主义的美学观，以克服他们的世界主义的错误思想。这种学习需要较长时间才能收效，但却是解决思想问题的根本办法。二、开展作品讨论，举行展览会，批判作品，比作品，从作品中批判思想，指出现实主义和形式主义之间的好坏、区别，得出结论，大家学习。我们在各国多次参观了美术展览会，其中作品有好有坏，都拿出来展览，借以广泛征求群众意见，在展览期间进行比较讨论，通过作品来进行教育。因为他们认为如果不能用作品来说明，则所谓社会主义的现实主义是最好的创作方法就不能为人所信服。匈牙利在解放后曾组织了文艺界的三次大论战，第一次是为了反对“为艺术而艺术”的文艺思想，打通走向社会主义现实主义的道路，这次论战给青年作家指出了正确的方向，使他们认识到文学艺术的任务是服务于国家建设，是帮助党教育及改造群众。论战后产生了民主作家协会，许多作家开始学习反映现实生活。第二次是为了反对公式主义，当时人民群众喜欢看苏联作家的作品，不喜欢看匈牙利作家的作品，因为这些匈牙利作品没有反映活生生的现实，其中的形象不过是政治口号的人格化，或者照他们的说法是生了两条腿的童话式的口号。第三次是反对颓废主义的情绪，当时有些作家藉口反对公式主义，创作了歪曲现实的作品，他们歌颂死亡，歌颂孤独，充满了颓废主义的情绪；这次论战严格批判了这种情绪，提倡健康的真正能正确反映现实生活的现实主义。上述三次论战都是结合批判作品进行的，因此收到了很大的效果。三、鼓励创作，保障作家生活，对有贡献的创造出好的作品的作家给以国家奖励，如波兰、德国设有国家奖金，保加利亚设有季米特洛夫奖金；对优秀的文学家、艺术家授以荣誉称号，如功勋艺术家、人民艺术家等称号；政府文化部门和作家订立创作合同，国家设立创作基金，并给以创作上的一切便利。东欧人民民主国家就是以这样的几种方法来指导和帮助文艺家进行思想改造的，但思想改造不是一朝一夕所能作到的，所以他们对文艺家所采取的方针是坚决改造，诚恳帮助，耐心等待的方针。由于采取了这样的方针和上述的方法，东欧人民民主国家的文学艺术家们的思想大大地提高了，在整个文化艺术界，为人民服务的思想和社会主义现实主义的创作方法已成为主导的指导原则了。
