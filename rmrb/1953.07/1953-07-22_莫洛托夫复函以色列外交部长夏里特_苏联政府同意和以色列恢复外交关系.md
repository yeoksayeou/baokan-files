Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 20th: The Soviet Union and Israel are restoring diplomatic relations.

On May 28th, the Israeli government, through its Chargé d'Affaires in Bulgaria, requested the Soviet Ambassador to Bulgaria to inform the Soviet government that the Israeli government was willing to restore diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Israel, which were severed by the Soviet government on February 12th in view of the bombing of the Soviet Legation in Israel.

Following subsequent negotiations, Israeli Foreign Minister Sharett sent the following letter to Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov on July 6th:

"Your Excellency,

I. The Israeli government has recently observed a significant improvement in the international situation and a general new willingness to reach peaceful and constructive solutions to major international issues. In continuing to adhere to its consistent policy of seeking the friendship of all peace-loving nations and doing its utmost to help establish normal and harmonious relations among all peoples, the Israeli government is willing to raise now the question of restoring diplomatic relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Israel.

II. The Soviet government severed its diplomatic relations with Israel after the Soviet Legation in Tel Aviv was damaged by the explosion of a bomb placed by criminals who have not yet been discovered, resulting in loss of life and property. The Israeli government remembers that, in its note of February 10, 1953, to the Soviet Legation in Tel Aviv, it expressed its deep regret and apology for the crime committed against the Legation, and was willing to fully compensate for the damage and material losses suffered by the Legation and its staff.

The Israeli police have made every effort to investigate these criminals in order to bring them to justice. It must be recalled that, for reasons beyond the control of the Israeli police, the investigation of clues at the scene of the outrage could only begin fifteen hours after the outrage occurred. Police authorities have conducted extensive searches in the offices of certain organizations and in private homes, and dozens of persons suspected of complicity have been detained for interrogation.

Unfortunately, to date, the investigation has not yielded clear results, but the issue is by no means closed, and the investigation of clues continues unabated, with the hope that the criminals can still be arrested and interrogated and given due punishment.

III. The Israeli government wishes to take this opportunity to reiterate its reply of December 8, 1951, to the note of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs of November 21, 1951. In that reply, Israel declared: 'Israel has never agreed, and will not agree in the future, to support activities that are aggressive or prepare for aggression against the Soviet Union or any other peace-loving country.' This policy has not changed. Because of its lack of hostility toward the Soviet Union, and on the contrary, its eagerness to establish and maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, Israel will not participate in any alliance or convention aimed at aggression against the Soviet Union.

IV. The Israeli government formally suggests that the government the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that the normal diplomatic relations, which were interrupted on February 12,1935 should now be re-established in a spirit of true international friendship.

Please accept, Your Excellency, the expression of my highest consideration.

Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs
(Signed) Sharett"

Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov replied to Israeli Foreign Minister Sharett's letter on July 15 as follows:

"Mr. Minister,

Here is the reply to your letter of July 6, 1953:

As is known, on February 9th, a bomb explosion was caused by thugs at the Soviet Legation in Israel, as a result of which one Legation official and several family members of officials were seriously injured. For this reason, the Soviet government recalled the Soviet Minister to Israel and other personnel of the Legation, and severed diplomatic relations with the Israeli government.

On May 28th, the Israeli government submitted to the Soviet government a proposal to restore diplomatic relations between Israel and the Soviet Union.

In studying the proposal, the Soviet government took into consideration that the Israeli government had expressed deep regret and apology for the crime committed against the Soviet Legation in Tel Aviv, and that, although the search for criminals has not yielded clear results, according to the Israeli government, the Israeli government is still continuing to search for criminals, hoping to arrest them and bring them to trial.

The Soviet government also took into account the Israeli government's statement that the Israeli government would not participate in any alliance or convention aimed at aggression against the Soviet Union.

Taking into account the above-mentioned assurances of the Israeli government and its expression of its desire to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, following its policy of maintaining normal relations with other countries and strengthening cooperation among all peoples, also declares that it hopes to establish friendly relations with Israel and believes that it is possible to restore diplomatic relations with the Israeli government.

Mr. Minister, please accept the expression of my highest consideration.

(Signed) V.M. Molotov
July 15, 1953"

    莫洛托夫复函以色列外交部长夏里特
    苏联政府同意和以色列恢复外交关系
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：苏联和以色列恢复外交关系。
    五月二十八日，以色列政府经由它驻保加利亚的临时代办要求苏联驻保加利亚大使转告苏联政府，以色列政府愿意恢复苏联和以色列之间的外交关系，这种关系是苏联政府鉴于苏联驻以色列公使馆被投炸弹事在二月十二日中断的。
    由于后来进行的谈判，以色列外交部部长夏里特在七月六日以下列信件送给苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫：“阁下：
    最近以色列政府看到国际局势已有显著的好转，并且看到一种普遍的新的愿意就重大国际悬案达成和平的和建设性的解决的愿望。以色列政府为继续遵循它的关于谋求所有爱好和平的国家的友谊并尽其所能帮助建立各国人民之间的正常与和谐关系的一贯政策，愿意在现在提出关于恢复苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和以色列之间的外交关系的问题。
    二、苏联政府在苏联驻特拉维夫公使馆受到尚未被发觉的罪犯们所放置的一颗炸弹的爆炸，因而造成人员和财产的损失之后，即断绝它和以色列的外交关系。以色列政府记得，它在一九五三年二月十日给苏联驻特拉维夫的公使馆的照会里，曾经对于对公使馆所犯的罪行，表示深切的遗憾，并对这件事表示歉意，愿意全部赔偿公使馆及其人员所遭受的损伤和物质损失。
    以色列的警察已尽了一切力量侦查这些罪犯，以使他们受法律制裁。必须追述，由于以色列警察无力控制的种种原因，对暴行现场的线索的调查，只能够在暴行发生后十五小时才开始。警察当局已经在某些组织的办公室以及私人住宅进行了广泛的搜查，数十名可能有共谋嫌疑的人已被拘留加以审讯。
    不幸，到现在为止，调查还未得到明确的结果，但是对这个问题决不是就此停止，现仍不遗余力地继续调查线索，希望仍然可以逮捕和审讯这些罪犯，并给以应得的处罚。
    三、以色列政府愿利用这个机会追述一下它在
    一九五一年十二月八日对苏联外交部一九五一年十一月二十一日的照会的答复。在这个答复中，以色列宣布：‘以色列过去从未同意，将来也不同意支持对苏联或任何其他爱好和平的国家进行或准备进行侵略的活动。’这个政策没有改变。由于对苏联没有敌意，相反地，还急于和苏联建立和保持友好关系，以色列将不参加任何目的在侵略苏联的联盟或公约。
    四、以色列政府正式向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府建议：在一九五三年二月十二日中断的正常外交关系，现在应当以真正的国际友谊精神重新予以建立。
    让我对阁下致最崇高的敬意。
     以色列外交部部长
            夏里特（签名）”
    苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫在七月十五日答复以色列外交部部长夏里特的信如下：
    “部长先生：
    这里答复你一九五三年七月六日的来信如下：
    大家知道，在二月九日，有暴徒在苏联驻以色列公使馆内制造了一次炸弹爆炸事件，结果使公使馆官员一名及几名官员家属受了重伤，为此，苏联政府就召回了苏联驻以色列的公使及公使馆其他人员，并和以色列政府断绝了外交关系。
    五月二十八日，以色列政府把一项要求恢复以色列和苏联之间的外交关系的建议交给苏联政府。
    在研究该建议时，苏联政府考虑到以色列政府已对这次对特拉维夫苏联公使馆所犯的罪行表示了深切的遗憾和歉意，并且，虽然搜查罪犯一事尚未得到明确的结果，但据以色列政府说，以色列政府还在继续搜查罪犯，希望能逮捕他们并加以审判。
    苏联政府并考虑到以色列政府关于以色列政府决不参加任何以侵略苏联为目的的联盟或公约的声明。
    考虑到上述以色列政府的保证以及它渴望和苏联建立友好关系的表示，苏联政府遵循着它的和其他国家保持正常关系以及加强各国人民间的合作的政策，同样宣布它希望和以色列建立友好的关系，并认为和以色列政府恢复外交关系是可能的。
    部长先生，请接受我最高的敬意。
        维·米·莫洛托夫（签名）
            一九五三年七月十五日”
