Reader Qingcun's letter: In Longshan Village, First District, Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, farmers Wang Yongxin, Wu Chenggui, and others violated the forest protection policy this spring and indiscriminately felled more than 4,000 small pine trees for firewood. After the village's forestry commissioner, Fu Baoshan, discovered this situation, he immediately discussed it with the village party branch secretary, Liu Fengcun, and decided to report it to the district government while simultaneously stopping Wang Yongxin and others from destroying the trees. However, when Fu Baoshan advised Wang Yongxin and others not to cut down pine trees, Wang Yongxin and others not only refused to listen but also became very angry. Afterward, Fu Baoshan and Liu Fengcun sent letters and had face-to-face talks with the district government more than ten times, but the district government consistently failed to take any action. The two of them also reported the situation to the county forestry section twice, but the head of the forestry section, Li Xingzhen, also ignored the problem and kept making excuses. As a result, the farmers like Wang Yongxin who were destroying the trees became even bolder, and other farmers also cut down trees for firewood. When village cadres saw the destruction of trees, they had to pretend they didn't see it, fearing that the county and district would not support them and thus不敢管 [dare not manage]. The Fengcheng County Forestry Section and the First District Government's failure to earnestly implement the forest protection policy has already caused very bad results. They should quickly correct this error, educate the masses not to destroy trees, and provide support and encouragement to farmers who actively protect forests.

    凤城县林业科和第一区政府
    为什么不支持群众护林行动
    读者青村来信：辽东省凤城县第一区龙山村农民王永信、武成贵等，在今年春天违犯护林政策，滥伐了四千多棵小松树做柴烧。该村林业委员傅宝善发现这个情况后，立即和村里党支部书记刘凤村商量，决定一面向区上报告，一面制止王永信等破坏林木的行为。但当傅宝善劝说王永信等不要砍伐松木时，王永信等不但不听，反而大发脾气。之后，傅宝善、刘凤村两人曾给区政府去信和面谈共十几次，区里始终不加处理。他们两人又各到县林业科反映情况两次，林业科长李兴振对这个问题也是置之不理，一味推托。这样，王永信等破坏林木的农民就愈发大胆了，其他农民也纷纷砍树当柴烧。村干部看见了破坏林木的现象，也只得假装没看见，怕县区不支持而不敢管。凤城县林业科和该县第一区政府这种不认真执行护林政策的行为已经引起很不好的结果。他们应该迅速纠正这种错误，教育群众不要破坏林木，并对积极护林的农民加以支持和鼓励。
