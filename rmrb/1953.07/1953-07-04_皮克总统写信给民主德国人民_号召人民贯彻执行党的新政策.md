Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd -- According to the German News Agency, "Neues Deutschland" published a letter from President Wilhelm Pieck to the people of the German Democratic Republic on July 2nd. The letter stated:

    Since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic on October 7, 1949, under the leadership of the party of the working class, rapid and comprehensive progress has been made in the work of peaceful reconstruction. This is manifested in the continuous improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of the people, the extremely smooth development of state-owned industry, agricultural harvests reaching pre-war levels, and the people's general optimism and enthusiasm for labor. In the middle of last year, the situation changed. This change is reflected in the deterioration of the Republic's situation and the deepening of the rift between the eastern and western parts of our country.

    Due to numerous signals from the working people of the Republic, and the increasing difficulties in the struggle for a peaceful solution to the German question, the Political Bureau of our Party Central Committee solemnly examined the policies of the Party and the government. The result of this discussion was the publication of a communiqué by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party on June 9, 1953, proposing necessary revisions to the policies of the Party and the government.

    The aim of the new policy is to decisively improve the living standards of all sections of the people and to consolidate the legal rights of the people of the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, its aim is also to promote reconciliation between the eastern and western parts of Germany, thereby re-establishing German unity. In short, the results of these measures will be:

    (1) A rapid increase in the living standards of workers, employees, and the laboring intelligentsia.

    (2) Facilitating and assisting farmers—both laboring farmers and large farmers—so that they can supply the market with more grain and agricultural products through careful planning and increased livestock breeding.

    (3) Facilitating and assisting artisans, small merchants, and small and medium-sized employers in industry, construction, trade, and transportation, so that they can increase production to improve and accelerate the supply of consumer goods to the people.

    (4) Rapidly providing assistance to all those who have left the territory of the Republic—facilitating their return and returning their property.

    (5) Relaxing the conditions for issuing interzonal transit passes and residence permits to our West German compatriots, in order to facilitate and improve normal relations between our east and west.

    (6) Normalizing relations between the state and the church.

    (7) Re-examining all cases of arrest and punishment, as well as criminal procedures, to determine whether the measures taken were too severe and therefore unacceptable.

    The new policies proposed by our Party leadership were agreed upon by the allied parties in the government's discussions. The Council of Ministers issued a communiqué on June 11, announcing the first batch of measures, and all state and administrative organs immediately began to implement them rapidly and without bureaucracy.

    The announcement of the new policies and their immediate implementation produced the expected diverse effects. The vast majority of the people of the Republic sincerely welcomed these measures. All prominent figures in West Germany who sincerely and honestly strive for pan-German understanding also welcomed it. The warmongers and the Adenauer group and their foreign supporters have taken a completely hostile attitude towards our new policies. The international situation and the growth of peace-loving forces around the world have played a significant role in this regard. Due to the conciliatory attitude of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean armistice negotiations have made smooth progress, making the extinguishing of the flames of war in the Far East a real possibility. The victory of the anti-fascist peace forces in the elections in France and Italy has made it more difficult for the United States to implement its war policy in Europe. Due to the attitude of the British people, and the increasingly arrogant attempts by American imperialism to dominate the world, British Prime Minister Churchill had to call for a four-power conference. The commentary in the Soviet Communist Party's central organ "Pravda" on Churchill's speech in the House of Commons convincingly explained to the world that the Soviet Union is steadfastly and calmly continuing to implement its policy of peace and understanding between all nations.

    Due to the growing strength of international peace forces, West German and American warmongers believe that our Party and government's new policies pose a more serious threat to their policy of intensifying the transformation of the "Cold War" into a hot war. They need a fragmented Germany, a center of unrest and provocation in the heart of Europe, in order to continue to reap huge profits from rearmament and war. In addition, Adenauer believes that the unimpeded and successful implementation of the new policies poses a threat to his position in future elections. Precisely because our new policies will promote pan-German understanding, promote the end of Germany's division and the realization of peace, and precisely because it can prevent the conspiracies of splitters and warmongers, West German and American imperialists are attempting to launch a fascist adventurous action to sabotage it. Therefore, they quickly launched "Day X"...

    President Pieck pointed out that the Socialist Unity Party and the government accepted the historical lessons of the Hitler fascist coup, mobilized the laboring people, the People's Police and other state organs, and with the active assistance of the Soviet army, crushed the fascist adventure. In the struggle to safeguard the democratic order and strive for the unification of Germany on the basis of peace and true democracy, the Socialist Unity Party and the German working class have received the support of the international working class and peace-loving people of all countries.

    President Pieck continued: Nevertheless, it cannot be ignored that fascist secret agents and provocateurs have been able to mislead a section of the laboring people to achieve their goals. There have been short-term strikes and demonstrations. The reason for this situation is that the Party has moved too far ahead, that the trade unions have become detached from the workers, and that the full significance of the new policies we have taken to improve living standards, consolidate our Republic and peacefully rebuild a truly democratic Germany has not been sufficiently explained to the workers...

    President Pieck emphasized at the end of his letter that the main task of the Party and all progressive and peace-loving people in the Republic now is to:展开党的最大限度的活动、向最广泛的人民群众解释法西斯冒险行为的背景与意图、改变党和群众工作的不正确的方法、对工人采取绝对坦白的态度、动员人民中一切健康的力量来实现新的政策。 He called on all the laboring people of state-owned industries, production cooperatives and state-owned plantations, all farmers and artisans, and all honest small merchants to cooperate more actively than before. In this way, the measures that the government has already decided on and those that are planned to be implemented in the future can be implemented as quickly and successfully as possible, in accordance with the greatest interests of the people of all strata.

    皮克总统写信给民主德国人民
    号召人民贯彻执行党的新政策
    【新华社三日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：七月二日“新德意志报”刊载威廉·皮克总统写给德意志民主共和国人民的一封信，信中说：
    自从德意志民主共和国在一九四九年十月七日成立以来，在工人阶级政党的领导下，和平恢复工作有了迅速的、全面的进展。这表现在广大人民的生活水平不断提高，表现在国有工业的极顺利的发展，表现在农业收成达到了战前水平，表现在人民的普遍的乐观情绪和劳动热情上。在去年中间，情况有了改变。这种改变表现在共和国情况的恶化和我国东西两部之间裂痕的加深。
    由于发自共和国劳动人民的许多信号，以及在争取和平解决德国问题的斗争中困难增加，我们党中央委员会政治局郑重地检查了党和政府的政策。这次讨论结果是统一社会党中央委员会政治局于一九五三年六月九日发表了一个公报，提出了对党和政府的政策的必要的修改。
    新方针的目的在于使各阶层人民的生活水平得到决定性的提高，并把德意志民主共和国人民的法定权利巩固下来。同时，它的目的也是在促进德国东西两部分之间的和解，从而重新建立德国的统一。扼要地说，这些措施的结果会是：
    （一）工人、职员、劳动知识分子的生活水平迅速提高。
    （二）便利并帮助农民——劳动农民和大农——使他们能够靠周密的计划和增加牲畜饲养以更多的粮食和农产品供应市场。
    （三）便利并帮助手工业者，小商人和工业、建筑业、贸易、运输业的中小雇主，使他们能增加生产，以改善并加快对人民的消费品供应。
    （四）迅速给所有离开共和国领土的人以帮助——给他们以归来的方便并发还他们的财产。
    （五）放宽对我们的西德同胞的东西区间通行证和居住许可证的签发条件，以方便并改善我国东西之间的正常关系。
    （六）使国家与教会之间的关系正常化。
    （七）重新检查一切逮捕和惩处的案件以及刑事程序，以确定所采取的措施是否过严因而是不能允许的。
    我们党的领导所建议的新方针在政府的讨论中得到联盟各党派的同意。部长会议于六月十一日发布公报，宣布了第一批措施，所有国家和行政机构随即开始迅速地、没有官僚主义地执行起来。
    新方针的宣布以及它的立即付诸实施产生了预料得到的不同的效果。共和国人民中的绝大多数真诚地欢迎这些措施。西德的所有真诚地、正直地为全德谅解而努力的著名人物也欢迎它。战争贩子和阿登纳集团和他们的外国支持者对我们的新方针完全采取敌对的态度。国际形势和全世界爱好和平力量的增长在这方面起了不少的作用。由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中国人民志愿军代表团的和解的态度，朝鲜停战谈判进展很顺利，这使扑灭远东战火有了真正的可能性。反法西斯的和平力量在法国和意大利的选举中取得的胜利，使得美国在欧洲的战争政策的执行更加困难了。由于英国人民的态度，由于美帝国主义妄图统治世界越来越专横，英国首相邱吉尔不得不要求举行四国会议。苏联共产党中央机关报“真理报”关于邱吉尔在下院演说的评论令人信服地向全世界说明：苏联坚持不渝地、平静地继续执行它的和平与各国人民之间谅解的政策。
    由于国际和平力量日益壮大，西德和美国战争贩子认为我们的党和政府的新方针对他们的加紧把“冷战”变成热战的政策是更严重的威胁。他们需要一个四分五裂的德国，需要在欧洲的心脏有一个不安与挑衅的中心，他们才能从重整军备与战争中继续获得巨额利润。此外，阿登纳认为新方针得以不受妨碍地、圆满地实施对于他在将来的选举中的地位是一个威胁。正因为我们的新方针将促进全德的谅解，促进德国分裂状态的结束与和平的实现，正因为它能防止分裂分子和战争贩子的阴谋，所以西德和美国帝国主义者企图发动法西斯冒险行动来破坏它。因此，他们很快地发动了“X日”……。
    皮克总统指出：统一社会党和政府接受了希特勒法西斯政变的历史经验教训，动员了劳动人民、人民警察和其他国家机关，在苏联军队的积极帮助底下，粉碎了法西斯的冒险。在保障民主秩序和争取在和平与真正民主的基础上统一德国的斗争中，统一社会党和德国工人阶级得到国际工人阶级和一切国家爱好和平人民的支持。
    皮克总统接着说：尽管如此，还不能不看到，法西斯特务和挑衅分子曾经能够把一部分劳动人民引入歧途，来达到他们的目的。曾经发生了短时间的罢工和示威。所以会发生这种情况，是因为党走得太前了，是因为工会脱离了工人，也是因为没有向工人们充分地解释我们所采取的旨在提高生活水平、巩固我们的共和国并和平地重新建设一个真正民主的德国的新方针的整个重要意义……。
    皮克总统在信的末尾强调：现在党以及共和国内所有进步与爱好和平人民的主要任务是：展开党的最大限度的活动、向最广泛的人民群众解释法西斯冒险行为的背景与意图、改变党和群众工作的不正确的方法、对工人采取绝对坦白的态度、动员人民中一切健康的力量来实现新的政策。他号召国营工业、生产合作社和国营种植园的全体劳动人民，所有农民和手工业者以及所有诚实的小商人比以前更积极地合作。这样，政府已经决定的以及那些计划在今后实行的措施才能够尽速地并且成功地实施，以符合所有阶层的人民的最大利益。
