Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: According to the Polish News Agency Warsaw on July 28th: All Polish newspapers published commentaries on the armistice agreement signed in Korea on July 27th.

    "People's Tribune" said in an article entitled "A Great Contribution to the Cause of Peace": This is significant and joyful news. The armistice agreement has been signed in Korea. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are relieved and delighted that the slaughter in Korea has finally been stopped, that there are now more opportunities than ever to extinguish the flames of war, and that the forces of peace have finally won a great victory. The newspaper said: "The cessation of hostilities in Korea is a major step towards easing international tensions, which the Soviet Union is striving for and which the people of all countries in the world desire. The concrete progress made on the difficult Korean issue strengthens the confidence of all countries: as long as the countries concerned are sincere, all outstanding international issues can be resolved peacefully through consultation." The newspaper said that people of all countries recognize that the realization of the Korean armistice is due to the powerful rise and activity of the military situation on the front lines and the forces of peace. "The people of all countries are more vigilant than ever to complete the victory of bringing peace to Korea, consolidate this victory, and ensure that it is not harmed by the tricks of the enemies of peace. The people of all countries will remain vigilant to prevent the Syngman Rhee gang from undermining the armistice agreement with the connivance of the US side, and the people of all countries will remain vigilant to prevent the political conference to be held soon to resolve the Korean issue peacefully from being undermined by the forces that are still undermining the Korean armistice negotiations."

    "People's Tribune" also said, "We are very pleased that the representatives of Poland participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will be able to contribute to ensuring peace in Korea in accordance with the will of the Polish people and the policies of our government. Every Pole fervently hopes that the armistice agreement can be realized, can become a starting point for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and can help ease international tensions and consolidate the peace desired by the people of all countries."
        "Warsaw Life" wrote in an article entitled "The Victory of Peaceful Thought": "When people all over the world heard the news of the signing of the armistice agreement in Panmunjom, their hearts were filled with joy. The Polish people especially warmly welcome this news because they know the bitterness of being enslaved and the price of freedom. They know the destruction of war and the hardship of reconstruction. The armistice agreement signed yesterday was also influenced to some extent by our struggle for peace. We Poles have also made considerable contributions to the conclusion of the armistice agreement. The people of all countries in the world welcome the news of the signing of the armistice agreement in Panmunjom vigilantly but full of hope. Vigilant because - there are war vendors and merchants of death in front of them who want to drown mankind in a sea of blood. Full of hope because - the idea of peace, which is most cherished by millions of people, will surely win the final victory, and the idea that is contrary to the conspiracy of the dark forces will finally win in the world."
    Xinhua News Agency Berlin, July 28th: Berlin democratic newspapers published in a prominent position on the 27th the communique announced by the Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations on the 26th that the negotiations had reached a complete agreement.

    The "New Germany" published a commentary saying: "The policy of peace and understanding of the governments of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea defeated the American war-mongers and forced them to sign the armistice agreement." The newspaper said: "This great victory achieved by the world peace camp is of great significance to the German people. The signing of the Korean armistice agreement will greatly increase the call for a peaceful solution to the German question."
    The "Tribune," the organ of the Free German Trade Union Federation, published a commentary saying: "Peace fighters all over the world have won a huge victory. This victory once again demonstrates the invincible strength of the world peace camp. At the same time, this victory is another achievement of the Soviet Union's unwavering peace policy - the Soviet Union took the first step towards achieving an armistice in Korea."
