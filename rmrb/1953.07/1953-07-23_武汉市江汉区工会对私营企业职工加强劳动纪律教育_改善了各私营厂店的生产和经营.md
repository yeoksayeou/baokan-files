The Jianghan District Federation of Trade Unions in Wuhan Strengthens Labor Discipline Education for Employees of Private Enterprises, Improving the Production and Operation of Various Private Factories and Stores

In the past, some workers and shop assistants in private enterprises in the Jianghan District of Wuhan did not pay enough attention to labor discipline. Many workers were absent from work without reason, took leave casually, did not adhere to working hours, and did not follow operating procedures. Some workers went out to see plays, dance, and even gamble at night, but slept during the day. For example, a worker at the Tianlun Soap Factory pretended to be sick and insisted that the doctor provide a certificate for rest, but in reality, he went home and played for ten days. Individual shop assistants at the Yuhua Tea Shop often requested sick leave because they were tired from dancing the previous night. Individual technicians at the Yixing Machine Factory frequently took leave and loafed on the job. Workers at some factories even arbitrarily stopped all the machines to rest. These situations seriously affected production. Some factories did not have much business to begin with, but they still could not complete the processing tasks. For example, the product quality of the Qunli Iron Factory was often substandard, resulting in rework and delays, and incurring fines. The reasons for the above phenomena are mainly that the trade union organizations did not provide sufficient political and ideological education for the workers and shop assistants in private enterprises, and many trade union cadres were afraid to educate workers who violated labor discipline, exhibiting serious liberalism and tailism. On the other hand, some factory owners and shopkeepers did not actively manage their businesses and lacked necessary management systems, and did not care about the workers' production safety and welfare. Individual capitalists even used various means to打击报复（retaliate against） workers, which affected the workers' morale and directly contributed to the chaos in production and operation.

In light of the above situation, the Jianghan District Federation of Trade Unions in Wuhan, under the instruction of the Jianghan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, decided to carry out education on consolidating labor discipline in all private enterprises, combined with the dissemination of the spirit of the Second Wuhan Municipal Congress of Trade Union Members. Starting from the end of May, they implemented the spirit of the congress at all levels, combined with the specific problems existing in each industry, and criticized grassroots trade union cadres and members who did not abide by labor discipline. For example, the Machinery Industry Trade Union, when disseminating the message, criticized the current lax labor discipline of workers and the excessive economic demands made regardless of production and business conditions, and pointed out the role of the private machinery industry during the national construction period and the tasks of the trade union. The Handicraft Industry Trade Union, in view of the current off-season in the industry, the abnormal production, and the workers' uneasiness, focused its dissemination report on "Consolidating Labor Discipline, Uniting with Capitalists to Find Solutions Together, Maintaining Production, Overcoming Difficulties, and Getting Through the Off-Season." The industrial trade unions praised advanced workers who had consistently observed labor discipline and criticized individual grassroots cadres and trade union members with poor character who had repeatedly refused to be educated at the dissemination meetings. By June 20, the district had organized 32 large and small reporting sessions, directly educating more than 13,000 members. After the dissemination reports, the grassroots trade unions went back and organized workers to conduct discussions, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and established some necessary systems based on the actual situation of each unit.

After this series of work, the phenomenon of lax labor discipline in many private enterprises in the Jianghan District has been initially corrected. Most workers have expressed their support for and endorsement of consolidating labor discipline. Yang Maosen, a worker at the Liangong Nail and Wire Factory, said, "This kind of congress has a great educational effect, and I hope to hold more of them." Zhang Zhengmin, a worker at the Yixing Machine Factory, said, "I think the higher-level trade union should have educated those with poor work attitudes a long time ago." Most of the workers who did not abide by labor discipline in the past have realized their mistakes. A worker from the 13th Committee of the 7th Branch of the Shop Employees' Trade Union did not abide by labor discipline in the past and refused to listen to the persuasion and education of the trade union cadres. After listening to the report, he took the initiative to find the trade union cadres and said, "I used to think that the trade union should not interfere with me, and I even cursed the trade union behind its back. Today I know that this is helping me, and I will definitely correct myself in the future." Zhang Zhongliang, a young worker at the Huifeng Letterhead Shop, used to feed sparrows and even hit and scold people during working hours. He also made a self-criticism at the group discussion and promised to correct his mistakes. After being educated by the trade union, Hu Chong'an, a technician at the Yixing Machine Factory, realized his mistakes, concentrated on production, and increased his daily production of leather rollers from one to three or three and a half. Mei Youyuan and Tu Zaichun, workers at the Wanyou Rice Mill, did not work seriously in the past and often had disagreements, which caused the factory's production to decline. After listening to the report, they admitted their mistakes, made self-criticisms, and boosted the morale of the factory's workers. The production volume increased from 700,000 catties per month to more than 900,000 catties, enabling the factory to balance its income and expenditure. The phenomena of absenteeism and absence from work in many factories have been greatly reduced, and there has been a significant increase in production. For example, in the first workshop of the Minjian Machine Factory, there were more than 40 sick leave cases in a week in May, but in June, there were only more than 10 cases of taking leave on false pretenses. The phenomenon of absenteeism was quite serious at the Xinmin Machine Factory in the past. In April, it only produced 80 sewing machine heads, but now it has increased to 240, which is twice as much as in April. Some factories, such as the Xinsheng Machine Factory, after inspecting labor discipline, also established democratic life meetings, formulated patriotic covenants for groups, and regularly carried out criticism and self-criticism to consolidate labor discipline. As a result, many factories and stores have improved and increased their production and operation. (Yan Qingyun, Chen Zhengpei)

    武汉市江汉区工会对私营企业职工加强劳动纪律教育
    改善了各私营厂店的生产和经营
    武汉市江汉区私营企业中部分工人店员过去很不重视劳动纪律。不少工人随便旷工、请假、不按时上下班，不遵守操作规程；有些工人晚上出去看戏、跳舞、甚至赌博，白天里却睡大觉。如天伦肥皂厂一个工人假装生病，硬要医生开证明休养，实际上他却回家玩了十天。毓华茶庄个别店员经常因为头天跳舞跳累了，第二天请病假。义兴机器厂个别技工经常请假，工作时磨洋工。个别工厂的工人甚至随便把车子全部停下来休息。这些情况严重地影响了生产。有的厂子生意本来不多，而加工任务还是不能完成。如群利铁工厂产品质量经常不合规格，以致返工误期，遭受罚款。产生以上现象的原因，主要是工会组织对私营企业的工人店员政治思想教育不够，许多工会干部对违犯劳动纪律的工人也不敢进行教育，存在着严重的自由主义和尾巴主义作风。另一方面，则是有些厂店的资方不积极经营，又缺乏必要的管理制度，不关心工人的生产安全和生活福利，个别资本家甚至以各种手段打击报复工人，因而影响了工人的情绪，直接助长了生产上与经营上的混乱现象。
    根据以上情况，武汉市江汉区工会在中共江汉区委的指示下，决定结合传达武汉市第二届工会会员代表大会精神，在全区私营企业中开展巩固劳动纪律的教育。从五月底开始结合各个行业中存在的具体问题，层层贯彻大会精神，并对不遵守劳动纪律的基层工会干部和会员进行批评。如机器业工会在传达时针对目前工人劳动纪律松弛，不顾生产营业状况提出过高经济要求等情况作了批判，并指出私营机器工业在国家建设时期的作用以及工会的任务。手工业工会针对该业目前处在淡季，生产不够正常，工人不安心等情况，便以“巩固劳动纪律，团结资方共同想办法，维持生产，克服困难，度过淡季”为传达报告的中心内容。各产业工会对一贯遵守劳动纪律的先进工人和个别品质恶劣、屡教不改的基层干部和工会会员，在传达会上进行了表扬或批评。到六月二十日止，全区已组织大小报告会三十二次，直接受到教育的会员有一万三千多人。各基层工会在传达报告之后，回去又分别组织工人进行讨论，开展批评与自我批评，并根据各单位实际情况，建立了一些必要的制度。
    经过这一系列的工作，江汉区许多私营企业中的劳动纪律松弛的现象已得到初步纠正。大部分工人对于巩固劳动纪律都表示拥护和支持。联工钉丝厂工人杨懋森说：“这样的大会有很大的教育作用，希望能多开几次。”义兴机器厂工人张正民说：“我觉得上级工会早就应该对这些劳动态度不好的人进行教育。”过去不遵守劳动纪律的工人大都认识了自己的错误。店员工会七分会十三委员会的一个工人过去不遵守劳动纪律，经工会干部说服教育也不听，在听了报告以后就主动找工会干部说：“原来我认为工会不应该来管我，背后还骂工会。今天才知道这是帮助我，以后一定改正。”惠风信简社青工张忠良以前在工作时间喂雀子，还打人骂人，这次在小组讨论会上也作了检讨，保证改正错误。义兴机器厂技工胡崇安受工会教育后，认识了自己的错误，安心生产，每天皮辊产量从一根提高到三根或三根半。万有米厂工人梅有原、涂在春，原来不认真生产，经常闹意见，使全厂生产下降。他们听了报告后，承认错误，作了检讨，鼓舞了全厂工人的情绪，生产量由每月七十万斤提高到九十多万斤，使收支达到平衡。许多厂子的旷工、缺勤等现象大大减少，生产上有了显著的提高。如民建机器厂第一车间五月份一周中有病假四十多个，六月份借故请假的就只有十多个了。新民机器厂以前旷工现象相当严重，四月份只出产缝纫车头八十部，现在增加到二百四十部，比四月份提高了两倍。有的工厂如新生机器厂在检查了劳动纪律后，还建立了民主生活会，订立小组爱国公约，经常开展批评与自我批评，以巩固劳动纪律。许多厂店因此在生产和经营上都有了改善和提高。（颜庆云、陈政培）
