    Two-Week Reader's Letters Processing Report

    From June 29th to July 5th, our newspaper's reader's letter group received a total of 3,006 reader letters, and various agencies replied to 726 letters from readers. Among them, 1,391 were related to political and legal issues, 919 were related to cultural and educational issues, 1,338 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, and 84 were of other nature. 106 letters were published in the newspaper; 859 readers were replied to individually; 1,445 were forwarded to relevant agencies for investigation, processing, reply, or reference; 1,167 were kept by our newspaper for reference or did not require further processing; and the remaining letters are currently under study and processing. During the same period, our newspaper's reader's letter group sent out a total of 3,744 letters replying to readers, forwarding letters to various agencies for investigation and processing, and expediting responses. In addition, there were 526 letters from family members of revolutionary soldiers searching for revolutionary soldiers, which were not included in the statistics.

    In these two weeks, we received many reader letters continuing to expose problems existing in railway transportation work, and criticizing certain railway bureaus for not handling compensation cases in a timely manner and for having overly complicated procedures. We are currently comprehensively studying these letters and plan to select some for publication. There are also some reader letters reflecting the serious backlog of materials in certain units, and we plan to investigate these before taking action. We have already selected and published some reader letters exposing the bloated and overlapping organizational structures of certain units and the wasteful use of cadres. We hope readers will continue to send letters exposing similar situations and offering suggestions for improvement.

    After the "Reader's Letters Summary" column in our newspaper on June 15th published the letter "Serious Problems at Harbin Railway Institute, Suggesting Leadership Organs Handle Quickly," we continued to receive some reader letters exposing the problems existing in the school. We have now forwarded these to the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government for investigation and handling, and relevant letters will not be published for the time being.

    The "Reader's Letters Summary" column in our newspaper on June 29th published a reader letter reflecting the serious fire in the raw cotton warehouses of the Handan and other Flower, Yarn and Cloth Companies, and proposed that the China Flower, Yarn and Cloth Company strengthen the management of raw cotton warehouses. This issue has already attracted the attention of some local Flower, Yarn and Cloth Companies. Some letters report on their recent improvements in raw cotton storage work; others have raised some difficulties in raw cotton storage work and requested assistance from higher-level companies. We plan to publish excerpts from these letters.

    Some reader letters reflect that the propaganda departments of Party committees in certain regions do not pay attention to the Party's propaganda network, do not provide specific leadership and assistance to propagandists, resulting in the propaganda network becoming a formality and propaganda work falling into drift. We plan to select some of these letters for publication, and we hope readers will continue to send letters reflecting problems in this regard.

    In addition, many readers have sent letters inquiring about the annual leave system for staff in industrial, mining, and enterprise systems. The Ministry of Labor of the Central Government replied: Due to the current immature conditions, the annual leave is temporarily not implemented in the agencies of industrial, mining, and enterprise systems. We have replied to the readers who inquired about this accordingly.

    这两周中，我们收到不少读者来信，继续揭发铁路运输工作中所存在的问题，并批评某些路局处理赔偿案件不及时，手续过于繁复。这些信件，我们正在综合研究，准备选择一部分发表。还有一些读者来信反映某些单位严重积压器材的情况，我们准备调查后再作处理。读者揭发某些单位机构臃肿重叠、使用干部有浪费现象的来信，我们已经选择
    一部分在报上发表了。希望读者继续来信揭发类似情况并提出改进意见。
    六月十五日本报“读者来信摘要”栏发表了“哈尔滨铁道学院问题严重建议领导机关迅速处理”的来信后，继续收到一些读者来信揭发该校存在的问题。现在我们已转请中央人民政府铁道部调查处理，有关来信暂不发表。
    六月二十九日本报“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者来信，反映邯郸等地花纱布公司原棉仓库发生严重火灾的情况，并提出了要中国花纱布公司加强原棉仓库管理工作的建议。这个问题已经引起了某些地方花纱布公司的重视，有的来信报告他们最近改进原棉保管工作的情况；有的提出了在原棉保管工作中的一些困难，要求上级公司协助解决。这些来信，我们准备择要发表。
    有一些读者来信反映某些地区的党委宣传部门不重视党的宣传网工作，不对宣传员进行具体领导和帮助，以致宣传网成为形式，宣传工作陷于自流。我们准备选择其中一部分发表，并且希望读者继续来信反映这方面的问题。
    此外，有很多读者来信询问有关工矿、企业系统工作人员的年休假制度的问题。经中央劳动部答复：目前因条件尚不成熟，故在工矿、企业系统的机关中暂不实行年休假。我们已据此答复来信询问的读者。
