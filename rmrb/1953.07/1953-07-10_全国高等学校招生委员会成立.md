    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th. The National Higher Education Enrollment Committee was officially established in Beijing on July 7th under the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government. The Enrollment Committee will lead the national higher education enrollment work this summer to enable higher education institutions to select qualified new students.
    Minister of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, Ma Xulun, made important instructions on the tasks and policies of national higher education enrollment this summer at the first meeting of the National Higher Education Enrollment Committee. Minister Ma Xulun pointed out that, in this year's higher education plan, based on the needs of national construction, the subjective conditions of higher education institutions, and the possible sources of students, it has been preliminarily determined that national higher education institutions will enroll a total of 70,000 new students. From the already determined enrollment ratios of various disciplines, it can be seen that educational construction primarily serves economic construction and the overall task of gradually realizing national industrialization, with a focus on training technical cadres for industry, mining, and transportation. Secondly, it adapts to the needs of school development and enhances people's health, attaching importance to the training of teachers and medical and health personnel. Minister Ma Xulun said that this year, national higher education institutions will implement unified enrollment to complete the enrollment plan with emphasis and comprehensiveness. Under the principle of unification, the requirements and characteristics of different schools and departments should be considered; at the same time, attention should be paid to the political quality, health conditions, and educational level of the students.
    The National Higher Education Enrollment Committee is composed of the heads or representatives of the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Second Ministry of Machine Industry, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, the Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government, the Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Students' Federation, and some university presidents.
