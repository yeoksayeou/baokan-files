Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 27th: Explanation of the Map Annex to the Korean Armistice Agreement Regarding Rear Ports and Major Transportation Routes.

    To ensure the stability of the Military Armistice, and to facilitate the holding of a higher-level political conference by both sides to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, in accordance with Items I and J of Article XIII of the Korean Armistice Agreement: the entry into Korea of reinforcing military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition from outside Korea shall cease. However, military personnel may be rotated on a one-for-one basis, and combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition damaged or depleted during the armistice period may also be replaced on a one-for-one basis of the same performance and type. These personnel and equipment may only enter and leave Korea through the ports listed in Article XLIII of the Armistice Agreement, with each side designating five ports. The ports on our side are: Sinuiju (40 degrees 06 minutes North latitude, 124 degrees 24 minutes East longitude).
    Chongjin (41 degrees 46 minutes North latitude, 129 degrees 49 minutes East longitude).
    Hungnam (39 degrees 50 minutes North latitude, 127 degrees 37 minutes East longitude).
    Manpo (41 degrees 09 minutes North latitude, 126 degrees 18 minutes East longitude).
    Sinanju (39 degrees 36 minutes North latitude, 125 degrees 36 minutes East longitude).

    Sinuiju and Manpo are two cities close to the border of the People's Republic of China, and are important channels to the People's Republic of China. Transportation is convenient, with railways and highways connecting to other major cities in Korea. Sinanju is located inland in Korea, close to the south bank of the Chongchon River on the west coast, and is a transportation hub. Chongjin and Hungnam are two import and export ports on the east coast.

    The five ports on the other side are: Incheon (37 degrees 28 minutes North latitude, 126 degrees 38 minutes East longitude).
    Daegu (35 degrees 52 minutes North latitude, 128 degrees 36 minutes East longitude).
    Busan (35 degrees 06 minutes North latitude, 129 degrees 02 minutes East longitude).
    Gangneung (37 degrees 45 minutes North latitude, 128 degrees 54 minutes East longitude).
    Gunsan (35 degrees 59 minutes North latitude, 126 degrees 43 minutes East longitude).

    Incheon, Busan, and Gunsan are all naval ports. Incheon and Busan are the largest ports in Korea with convenient transportation. Incheon and Gunsan are on the west coast, Busan is on the south coast, Gangneung is on the east coast, and Daegu is inland and is the largest supply base for the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

    Regarding transportation routes, Item F of Article XIII of the Armistice Agreement stipulates:

    "Full passage shall be granted to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams traveling along the main lines of communication agreed upon by both sides between the headquarters of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the ports listed in Article XLIII of this Armistice Agreement, and between the headquarters of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the locations where violations of this Armistice Agreement are reported to have occurred." The transportation routes referred to here are mainly for the convenience of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to travel for inspecting specific rear ports and areas outside the Demilitarized Zone. Each specific port has only one transportation route. The main transportation route is a first-class highway, from Busan via Daegu, Seoul, Kaesong, Pyongyang, Sinanju to Sinuiju. The transportation route is entirely highway, with automobiles as the means of transportation.

    After the armistice, the commanders of both opposing sides have an obligation to cease the entry of reinforcing military personnel and equipment from outside Korea. On the issue of how to supervise this, the other side repeatedly raised unreasonable demands for interference in internal affairs at the negotiation meetings, such as: demanding to be allowed to freely enter the entire territory of Korea in the name of inspection, etc., which were resolutely opposed by our side. Later, it was determined that neutral countries would perform the supervisory duties, and specific rear ports were designated as channels for military personnel and equipment to enter and exit Korea, with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission dispatching its Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to conduct inspections and investigations.

### 朝鲜停战协定中关于后方口岸及主要交通线的地图附件的说明

    朝鲜停战协定中关于后方口岸及主要交通线的地图附件的说明
    【新华社开城二十七日电】朝鲜停战协定中关于后方口岸及主要交通线的地图附件的说明。
    为保证军事停战的稳定，以利双方高一级的政治会议的进行，来达到朝鲜问题的和平解决，根据朝鲜停战协定第十三款寅项和卯项规定：停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，但军事人员可在一人换一人的基础上轮换，在停战期间毁坏耗损的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，亦得在同样性能同样类型的一件换一件的基础上进行替换，这些人员和装备只能经由停战协定第四十三款所开列的口岸进入和撤出朝鲜，这些口岸双方各规定为五个。在我方的有：新义州（北纬四○度○六分东经一二四度二四分）。
    清津（北纬四一度四六分东经一二九度四九分）。
    兴南（北纬三九度五○分东经一二七度三七分）。
    满浦（北纬四一度○九分东经一二六度一八分）。
    新安州（北纬三九度三六分东经一二五度三
    六分）。
    新义州、满浦是靠近中华人民共和国边境的两个城市，是通往中华人民共和国的要道，交
    通方便，有铁路、公路等通往朝鲜境内其他各大城市。新安州在朝鲜内地靠近西海岸清川江南岸，为交通要道。清津和兴南是东海岸的两个进出口岸。
    对方的五个口岸是：仁川（北纬三七度二八分东经一二六度三八分）。
    大邱（北纬三五度五二分东经一二八度三六分）。
    釜山（北纬三五度○六分东经一二九度○二分）。
    江陵（北纬三七度四五分东经一二八度五四分）。
    群山（北纬三五度五九分东经一二六度四三分）。
    仁川、釜山、群山都是军港，仁川和釜山是朝鲜最大的港口，交通方便，仁川、群山在西海岸，釜山在南海岸、江陵在东海岸，大邱在内地，是李伪军最大的兵站所在地。
    关于交通线在停战协定第十三款午项规定：
    “在中立国监察委员会及其中立国视察小组经由双方协议的主要交通线往返于中立国监察委员会总部与本停战协定第四十三款所开列的口岸时，以及往返于中立国监察委员会总部与据报发生违反本停战协定事件的地点时，给予充分的通行便利。”这里所指的交通线，主要是便利中立国监察委员会及其中立国视察小组为视察各特定后方口岸及非军事区以外的地区时通行的，每一个特定口岸都只有一条交通线，主要的一条交通线是一级公路，从釜山经大邱、汉城、开城、平壤、新安州到达新义州，交通线全系公路，以汽车为交通工具。
    停战后敌对双方司令官有义务停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事人员和装备，在对这一点如何进行监督的问题上，对方在谈判会议上曾屡次提出干涉内政的无理要求如：以视察为名要求允许其军事人员自由地进入朝鲜全境等，因而为我方所坚决反对，后来才确定由中立国来执行监察的职务，并规定了特定的后方口岸为军事人员与装备出入朝鲜的通道，由中立国监察委员会派遣其中立国视察小组进行视察与调查。
