The American aggressors and their running dogs, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, launched the war of aggression against North Korea in June 1950. This is the infamous warmonger, then-U.S. State Department advisor John Foster Dulles (first on the left), giving final instructions for the so-called "Northern Expedition" in the trenches along the 38th parallel in South Korea on the eve of the war.

The heroic Korean and Chinese troops fought against the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield. From October 1950 to May 1951, the Chinese and Korean troops launched five major campaigns, wiping out nearly 200,000 enemy troops, driving the enemy back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, and laying the foundation for victory in the anti-aggression war. This is a scene of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fiercely firing at the enemy while holding a high ground in Tieyuan during the Fifth Campaign.

The Chinese and Korean people have consistently advocated resolving the Korean issue through peaceful negotiation. During the negotiations, the Korean and Chinese armistice negotiation delegation strived to reach an armistice agreement. The picture shows the representatives of the Korean and Chinese armistice negotiation delegation (the third from the left is General Nam Il, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese armistice negotiation delegation).

After suffering disastrous defeats in the "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive," the American aggressors were forced to resume negotiations. Through our continuous efforts, an agreement was reached in November 1951 on the issue of establishing a demilitarized zone by determining the military demarcation line in the second agenda item. The picture shows our representative signing the agreement on the second agenda item.

The American aggressors妄想 wanted to strangle the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea and further invade China and enslave all of Asia. The heroic Korean people rose up to defend their motherland and dealt a head-on blow to the aggressors.

Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, and General Peng Dehuai, commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, meet at the front.

During the negotiation process, the U.S. side adopted delaying and obstructive tactics to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. In August and September 1951, U.S. aircraft twice bombed and strafed the residence of our delegation in the Kaesong neutral zone. The picture shows the liaison officer of our delegation notifying the other side to conduct a joint on-site investigation after the incident, and personnel from both sides are inspecting the crater situation.

The American aggressors, fearing both war and peace, launched a bacteriological warfare attack when the negotiations entered the discussion of the remaining three agenda items in January 1952. This inhuman act by the enemy was quickly and thoroughly crushed by the Korean and Chinese troops and the Korean people. The picture shows the epidemic prevention personnel of the Korean and Chinese troops carrying out the work of eliminating bacteria and disinfecting in the field.

In order to protect our homes and defend our country, our people launched the great campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, organized the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, crossed the Yalu River, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army against the American aggressors in the freezing cold.

The great victory of the Korean and Chinese troops and the failure of the U.S. military on the Korean battlefield forced the American aggressors to accept the suggestion made by the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, regarding the Korean armistice negotiations. Armistice negotiations began in Kaesong in July 1951. The picture shows the U.S. negotiation delegation's car, with a small white flag, driving towards the Kaesong meeting place.

In July 1951, the U.S. launched the so-called "Summer Offensive," and in September, launched the "Autumn Offensive,"妄图 attempting to force our side to accept its unreasonable demands by military force. However, these offensives suffered disastrous defeats. The picture shows the artillery units of the Korean People's Army launching a fierce counterattack against the enemy.

Because our side insisted on a fair and reasonable resolution to the Korean issue, the two sides reached an agreement on 63 articles of the draft Korean Armistice Agreement in August 1952. However, the U.S. side then unreasonably proposed a "voluntary repatriation" plan, which was in fact a plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel. This was resolutely opposed by the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world. Subsequently, the U.S. side unilaterally announced an indefinite suspension of negotiations and launched a fierce attack on our army in the Shangganling area, which was met with a head-on blow by our army. The enemy suffered 25,000 casualties, and we won a great victory. The picture shows Yi Caixue, a special-class meritorious person and second-class hero in the Shangganling battle, advancing towards the enemy.

In order to achieve the goal of sabotaging the negotiations, the American aggressors conducted so-called "screenings" in prisoner-of-war camps, attempting to force our captured personnel to abandon their desire to return to their motherland. This is a scene of the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Army in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, holding high portraits of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung, and the national emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, bravely and unyieldingly resisting the enemy's "screening" and slaughter atrocities.

The Chinese and Korean People's troops have become stronger and stronger in the Korean War and have become an invincible iron army. More than 980,000 enemy troops have been wiped out by the Korean and Chinese troops in the past three years (as of June 25 this year). The American aggressors have suffered disastrous defeats on the battlefield. This is a powerful tank unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

In order to strive for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and to further resolve international disputes, our Premier Zhou Enlai issued a statement on the Korean armistice negotiations in March 1953. This statement once again demonstrated the sincerity of the Korean and Chinese side in seeking peace.

The great victory achieved by the Korean and Chinese People's troops on the battlefield, the consistent efforts of the Korean and Chinese people to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and the just support of the people of the world, enabled the rapid realization of the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, thereby reaching an agreement on the long-standing prisoner-of-war issue. This good start opened the way for a complete resolution of the Korean issue. The picture shows our motorcade delivering the other side's sick and wounded prisoners of war to the U.S. reception area in Panmunjom. (All of the above are Xinhua News Agency manuscripts.)

    胜利属于为正义与和平而战的朝中人民
    美国侵路者及其走狗李承晚匪帮，在一九五○年六月发动了侵略北朝鲜的战争。这是臭名远扬的战争贩子、当时的美国国务院顾问杜勒斯（左第一人）战争前夕在南朝鲜三八线战壕中对所谓“北伐”给予最后指示。
    英勇的朝中部队在朝鲜战场上打击了美国侵略军。自一九五○年十月到一九五一年五月，中朝部队发动了五次大的战役，歼敌近二十万人，把敌人打回了三八线附近，奠定了反侵略战争胜利的基础。这是中国人民志愿军某部在第五次战役中坚守铁原某高地、猛烈向敌人射击的情形。
    中朝人民一贯主张用和平协商的办法解决朝鲜问题。在谈判中，朝中停战谈判代表团努力争取达成停战协议。图为朝中停战谈判代表团的代表们（左起第三人是朝中停战谈判代表团首席代表南日大将）。
    美国侵略者在“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”惨败以后，又被迫恢复谈判。在我方不断努力下，使第二项议程确立双方军事分界线以建立非军事区的问题在一九五一年十一月达成协议。图为我方代表在第二项议程协议书上签字。
    美国侵略者妄想扼死年青的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并进一步侵略中国，奴役全亚洲。英勇的朝鲜人民奋起捍卫自己的祖国予侵略者以迎头痛击。
    朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在前线会晤。
    在谈判过程中，美方采取了拖延、阻挠的手段，破坏朝鲜停战谈判。一九五一年八月和九月，美国飞机两次轰炸和扫射开城中立区内的我方代表团驻地。图为事件发生后，我方代表团联络官通知对方共同进行实地调查，双方人员正在检查弹坑的情形。
    美国侵略者既害怕战争，又害怕和平，当一九五二年一月谈判进入讨论其余三项议程的同时，美国侵略者发动了细菌战。敌人这一灭绝人性的行动，很快被朝中部队和朝鲜人民彻底粉碎。图为朝中部队的防疫人员正在野外进行扑灭细菌，进行消毒工作。
    我国人民为了保家卫国，发起了伟大的抗美援朝运动，组织了中国人民志愿军，跨过鸭绿江，在冰天雪地中和朝鲜人民军并肩对美国侵略军作战。
    朝中部队的伟大胜利和美军在朝鲜战场的失败，迫使美国侵略者接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克提出的关于朝鲜停战谈判的建议。一九五一年七月在开城开始进行停战谈判。图为美方谈判代表团的汽车竖着小白旗驶向开城会场。
    一九五一年七月，美方发动了所谓“夏季攻势”，九月，发动了“秋季攻势”，妄图用军事力量迫使我方接受它的无理要求。但是，这些攻势都遭到了惨败。图为朝鲜人民军炮兵部队向敌人展开猛烈反击。
    由于我方坚持公平合理解决朝鲜问题，一九五二年八月双方就朝鲜停战协定草案共六十三款取得协议，但美方又蛮横无理地提出了“自愿遣返”实即强迫扣留我方被俘人员的方案，遭到朝中人民和全世界人民的坚决反对，接着美方又片面地宣布无限期中断谈判，并在上甘岭地区向我军发动猛攻，被我军迎头痛击，敌人死伤两万五千人，我获得巨大胜利。这是上甘岭战斗中的特等功臣、二级英雄易才学正在向敌人进击的情形。
    美国侵略者为了达到破坏谈判的目的，在战俘营中进行所谓“甄别”，企图强迫我方被俘人员放弃返回祖国的愿望。这是在巨济岛战俘营中的朝中人民军的被俘人员，他们高举着斯大林、毛泽东、金日成的画像和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国徽，英勇不屈地反抗敌人的“甄别”和屠杀暴行。
    中朝人民部队在朝鲜战争中愈战愈强，成为不可战胜的铁军。三年来被朝中部队歼灭的敌军九十八万多名（至今年六月二十五日止），美国侵略者在战场上遭到了惨败。这是中国人民志愿军的强大的坦克部队。
    为了争取和平解决朝鲜问题，以进一步解决国际间的争端，我周恩来总理在一九五三年三月发表了关于朝鲜停战谈判问题的声明，这个声明又一次表现了朝中方面谋求和平的诚意。
    朝中人民部队在战场上取得的伟大胜利和朝中人民对和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯努力以及全世界人民的正义支持，使双方交换病伤战俘迅速实现，从而使长久以来悬而未决的战俘问题达成协议。这一个良好的开端，为朝鲜问题的全部解决打开了道路。图为我方汽车队将对方的病伤战俘送到板门店美方接收区。　（以上均系新华社稿）
