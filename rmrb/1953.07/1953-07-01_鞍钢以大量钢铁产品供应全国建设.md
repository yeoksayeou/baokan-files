    Anshan Iron and Steel Supplies National Construction with Large Quantities of Steel Products
    The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company supplies basic construction and industrial production throughout the country with large quantities of steel, steel ingots, steel billets, and pig iron. In the years since liberation, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has supplied millions of tons of steel products to the whole country. In the past year alone, steel and other finished steel products amounted to hundreds of thousands of tons. In May of this year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled its original plan for shipping steel, steel billets, and pig iron on behalf of customers in various regions. During this month, more than 3,300 train cars, fully loaded with angle steel, square steel, flat steel, round steel, forged steel parts, heavy steel billets, steel ropes, and cast steel pipes of various calibers, were transported to places such as Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Xi'an, and Qiqihar.
    Over the past four years, the iron and steel products produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company have played a significant role in supplying national construction and industrial production. For example, heavy rail billets rolled into steel rails for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway; light rails laid on the Huai River harnessing and Jingjiang flood diversion construction sites; steel axles and cold-cast wheels used on trains; steel and forged steel parts used by machinery manufacturing plants in Shenyang and other places; thick steel ropes for various cranes and ship cables; and cast iron pipes used for repairing sewers in the suburbs of Shanghai and on the banks of West Lake in Hangzhou, etc., were either entirely supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel Company or mostly supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel Company.
    In order to better supply customers across the country with steel and other products, Anshan Iron and Steel Company began using agency transportation methods in August of last year. By the second quarter of this year, steel and other products transported by the company's sales department on behalf of customers in various regions accounted for more than 60 percent of the total supply. Starting from the third quarter, the company plans to implement agency transportation methods for general steel and other products, except for certain orders. This will save the country a lot of manpower and financial resources and ensure timely supply. In the past, after customers in various regions placed orders with Anshan Iron and Steel Company through central agencies, most units sent several cadres to Anshan to handle inventory, receipt, and various self-transportation procedures. Many ordering units consumed a lot of manpower and financial resources by directly negotiating vehicles with railway departments, and the transportation of goods was also very slow. After the implementation of the agency transportation business, as long as customers in various regions sign orders with the central agencies, Anshan Iron and Steel Company will uniformly negotiate vehicles with the railway departments based on the types and quantities of products needed in various regions of the country and the time they are needed, and ship the goods to various regions in a planned manner. The payment that customers should pay to the company is also allocated by the People's Bank of China in various regions, and there is no need to send special personnel to negotiate back and forth. With the expansion of the agency transportation business and the timely shipment of steel and other products, there is very little backlog of finished products produced by the factories of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which has accelerated the turnover of funds in the factories. In the past, steel and other products produced by the factories were first transported to warehouses for storage, and when customers did not come to pick up the goods, the finished products had to be backlogged in the warehouses. Now, finished products produced in the factory can be inspected on the spot and directly loaded into vehicles and transported to various regions.

### 鞍钢以大量钢铁产品供应全国建设

    鞍钢以大量钢铁产品供应全国建设
    国营鞍山钢铁公司以大量的钢材、钢锭、钢胚和生铁，供应全国各地的基本建设和工业生产。解放以来的几年中，鞍山钢铁公司已把数百万吨的钢铁产品供应了全国，其中仅钢材和其他钢铁成品一项，在去年一年里，就有数十万吨。今年五月间，鞍山钢铁公司代各地定户运送的钢材、钢胚和生铁，都超额完成了原订计划。在这个月中，有三千三百多个火车车皮，满载着三角钢、方钢、扁钢、圆钢、锻钢件、重钢胚、钢绳和各种口径的铸钢管等，运到北京、上海、太原、西安和齐齐哈尔等地。
    四年来，鞍山钢铁公司生产的钢铁产品，对供应全国建设和工业生产起了极大的作用。如轧制成渝铁路和天兰铁路钢轨用的重轨胚，根治淮河和荆江分洪工地上铺设的轻轨，火车上用的钢轴和冷铸车轮，沈阳等地机械制造厂所用的钢材、锻钢件，各种起重机和作船缆用的粗钢绳，上海市郊和杭州西湖畔补修下水道所用的铸铁管等，有的全是鞍山钢铁公司供应的，有的大部是鞍山钢铁公司供应的。
    鞍山钢铁公司为了很好地供应全国各地定户钢材等产品，从去年八月就开始采用了代理运输的办法。到今年第二季度，由公司推销部门代各地定户运送的钢材等产品，达到了供应总数的百分之六十以上。从第三季度起，公司计划除某些定货外，一般的钢材等产品都要实行代客运输的办法，这将为国家节省大量的人力和财力，并能作到供应及时。过去，各地定户经过中央机关向鞍山钢铁公司定货后，大多数单位都派出几个干部来鞍山办理点货、收货和各种自运手续。许多定货单位由于直接向铁路部门交涉车辆，消耗了很多人力和财力，货物的运送也很迟缓。实行代运业务后，只要各地定户在中央机关签订定货合同，鞍山钢铁公司就会根据全国各地需要产品的品种、数量和需要的时间，统一向铁路部门交涉车辆，有计划地向各地发货。定户们应交付公司的货款，也由各地中国人民银行调拨，不必再派专门人员往返商洽。随着代运业务的扩大，钢材等产品的及时运出，鞍山钢铁公司各厂生产出来的成品，已很少有积压，加速了各厂资金的周转。过去各厂生产出来的钢材等产品，首先运往仓库保管，当定户不来提货时，成品只得积压在仓库里。现在，厂里生产的成材，在当场经过检查，就能直接装入车辆运往各地。
