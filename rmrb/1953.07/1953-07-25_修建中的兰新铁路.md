    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Under Construction
    Hong Liu
    Along the Great Wall, across the perilous Yellow River; from Lanzhou in the east to Jiuquan in the west; on a line stretching over 700 kilometers, tens of thousands of railway workers and laborers are responding to Chairman Mao's call to "continue to work hard to build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway," marching towards the Wushaoling Mountains, 3,000 meters above sea level, the Heihe River floodplain, six kilometers wide, and the grasslands and deserts where no one lives for hundreds of miles. They are building the first railway in the new China to pass through a Tibetan autonomous region.
    On the Lanzhou-Su section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which is currently under construction, people are fighting against all kinds of unimaginable difficulties.
    Whether the construction of a temporary bridge on the perilous Yellow River can be completed according to plan is the key to whether the construction task west of the Yellow River can be completed. The heroic workers of the Third Engineering Team of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau braved the severe cold of minus 10 to 20 degrees Celsius in early October last year, wading into the turbulent Yellow River in their bare bodies and fighting with ice floes. At that time, the Yellow River was flowing very fast, and the ice floes were very sharp. If one was not careful, the ice floes rushing down with the rapid current would sink the workers. But the heroes' enthusiasm for building the motherland overcame the cold. The divers often persisted in working in the water for more than three hours. Once, two huge ice floes tightly夹住了(jammed) a diver's body. His body ached as if cut by a knife, but when he thought of how the hero Huang Jiguang sacrificed his life on the Korean battlefield to defend the beautiful construction of the motherland, he felt stronger. He gritted his teeth and pushed away a large ice floe in front with both hands, and then dodged the ice floe behind him. When he came out of the water, the copper helmet was full of ice slag, the gloves turned into ice cubes, and his hands were frozen purple, but he said: "The ice floes can't eat me, but I'll just send them away obediently!" Another time, before sinking the caisson for the pier, workers Tian Shulin, Xu Jiafu and others were erecting steel cables on the river when the boat was overturned due to the rapid current. The seven people were washed away by the water for more than a kilometer. After they were rescued by the local villagers, they hurriedly changed into dry clothes and continued to work. The leading comrades said, "You should rest for a while!" Xu Jiafu said, "What's the rest? It's not cold when you work. Hurry up and build the bridge so that the machines and materials for building the road can be transported over!" Those workers who were pulling lead wires were sitting on skateboards, sliding back and forth on the high aerial lines. When their hands were tired, they rested their arms on the wire for a while and then continued to work. The employees put forward many rationalization proposals. Liu Zhaoxiang suggested moving the center line of the bridge 8 meters to the north, reducing one caisson and one steel beam, saving 50 million yuan. It took seven days to erect the first river-blocking rope. Later, the workers came up with the idea of putting iron rings on the lead wire rope and pulling it from the west bank, and two ropes were completed in one day, increasing work efficiency by thirteen times. In this way, in early January this year, the heroes built the bridge piers, and on February 12, they began to build the bridge, and soon they erected the bridge. Trains loaded with bulldozers, sleepers, steel rails, and cranes passed over this temporary Yellow River bridge, transporting materials to the construction site west of the river.
    At the foot of the Wushaoling Mountains, next to the snow-capped mountains, dozens of bulldozers transported over the Yellow River temporary bridge are roaring. Worker Guo Qingfu, who won the Red Banner for Operation, has not had a malfunction for 400 consecutive hours. Skilled technician and squad leader Xiong Guanghua led the entire squad of bulldozer drivers to tow scraper-loaders. His wife, female bulldozer operator Hu Youmei, drove a huge bulldozer in the wind and snow just like him. The sound of the engine attracted the Tibetan people nearby who were driving camel herds. They sat on the high ridges of the camels and smiled as they watched the magnificent scene of the new China's mechanical road construction.
    On the Heihe River floodplain, the world-famous wind tunnel, when the black wind blows, you can't see people on the opposite side, but the drilling workers insist on working on the "flying sand and rocks" beach. Worker Wang Fuyuan and others came up with several new methods to maintain the pit walls and prevent them from collapsing, completing the work half a month ahead of schedule and doubling work efficiency. The heroic words of these heroes are: "The Great Wall is not long, the newly built railway is longer than it. Push away the ice in the Yellow River, shovel away the snow on the Wushaoling Mountains, brave the strong wind and sand, and plant the red flag of railway construction on the northwest frontier of the motherland!"
    The construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has received enthusiastic support from the people of the Northwest, especially the minority brothers along the line. At the Chenjiagou construction site in Wushaoling, Tibetan Zang Yunhai led his wife and daughters to the construction site to comfort the surveyors. The Tibetans in the villages of Chenjiagou sent wheat straw and eggs to comfort the workers who were building a tunnel more than 900 meters long on the Wushaoling Mountains. Zhaxi Cairang, a cadre of the People's Government of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region, ran to the highest peak of the Wushaoling Mountains to comfort the workers of the Anyuan drill. The Tibetan cadres of the Qiming District in Jiuquan County were so excited that they could not sleep at night when they heard that the railway surveyors had arrived in Jiuquan. Early the next morning, they rushed to the street to find railway workers and asked, "When will the train pass through here?" It is completely understandable that the Tibetan people love this railway. Along the railway, there are the Qilian Mountains, which the Tibetans call the "Eight Treasure Mountains," and other local and special products of many ethnic minorities, such as medicinal materials and furs. In the past, it took 40 days to transport medicinal materials from Jiuquan to Lanzhou by cart, and the freight cost 2.1 million yuan per ton. In addition to the losses along the way, the cost of transporting licorice, qianghuo and other medicinal materials produced in the Tibetan areas to the inland was expensive, and they could not find a sales market. And fine cloth costing more than 2,000 yuan a foot in Shanghai, Tibetans in the Qiming District had to spend 5,000 yuan to buy; fine porcelain bowls costing 3,000 yuan each in Jiangxi, Tibetans had to spend 10,000 yuan to buy it. The Tibetans all know that if the train goes to Jiuquan, it will only take one day and one night to transport the large quantities of licorice and qianghuo produced by the Tibetans in Qiming District to Lanzhou, and the freight will be much cheaper than in the past. And fine cloth from Shanghai and porcelain bowls from Jiangxi can also be transported to the Tibetan areas at low prices.
    I visited many Tibetan areas along the Lanzhou-Su section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the minority brothers in the yurts on the grasslands. They all eagerly hope that the train will arrive in front of their homes as soon as possible. The Tibetans in the Tianzhu Autonomous Region are preparing to hold a horse racing meeting with more than 30,000 people and an exchange meeting of local and special products of ethnic minorities to welcome the arrival of the train. The Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region has made rapid progress in the three years since its establishment. The population has increased from 40,000 to 56,000, and the number of livestock has increased from 40,000 sheep to 130,000 sheep due to the adoption of new methods of animal husbandry. Schools have also developed to 56 normal schools, senior primary schools, and ordinary primary schools with Tibetan language courses. New-style midwifery training classes have recruited many Tibetan women. Recently, in order to welcome the arrival of the train, new houses are being built in large numbers on the streets. Ma Cailang, director of the Democratic Women's Federation of the Tianzhu Autonomous Region, told me: "Before liberation, 100 jin of wool could only be exchanged for three tea bricks. After liberation, it can be exchanged for more than 20 tea bricks. Last year, when the train went to Lanzhou, 100 jin of wool could be exchanged for more than 30 good tea bricks. If the train goes to the Wushaoling Mountains, the price of wool will be higher and the price of tea bricks will be lower, and life will be even better in the future!"
    I once heard young Tibetans singing like this along the first railway in the new China to pass through the Tibetan area:
    "The red sun shines on the grassland,
    Wholeheartedly thank Chairman Mao,
    He sent the road builders,
    He brought happiness!..."

    修建中的兰新铁路
    洪流
    沿着万里长城，跨过天险的黄河；东起兰州，西至酒泉；在长达七百多公里的线路上，数万名铁路员工和民工正响应毛主席“继续努力修筑兰新路”的号召，向拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭、宽达六公里的黑河河滩、百里无人烟的草地和戈壁进军。他们正为新中国修筑第一条通过藏族自治区的铁路。
    在正在建筑中的兰新铁路兰肃段工程上，人们和一切难以想像的困难作斗争。
    在天险的黄河上能否按计划修建成便桥是黄河以西施工任务能否完成的关键。西北铁路干线工程局第三工程队的英勇的工人们去年十月上旬冒零下十度到二十度的严寒，赤着身子窜在湍急的黄河水流里和冰块搏斗。那时，黄河的水流很急，冰块又很锋利，一不小心，那随急流冲下来的冰块会把工人击沉的。但英雄们建设祖国的热忱战胜了寒冷，潜水工们经常在水里坚持三个钟头以上的工作。有一次，两块巨大的冰块把一个潜水工的身子紧紧夹住了，他的身子像刀割似的疼痛，但他想到在朝鲜战场上黄继光英雄为保卫美丽的祖国的建设献出了自己的生命时，他就觉得增加了力量，一咬牙，用双手把前面一块大冰块推开，一窜身，又躲开了后面那块冰块。当他从水里上来的时候，铜帽子里已积满了冰渣，手套变成了冰块，双手冻成紫红色，但他说：“冰块吃不掉我，反叫我把它乖乖地打发走了！”另一次，在做桥墩下沉箱前，工人田树林、徐家富等七人在河上架钢丝绳时，因水流太急，船被冲翻了，七个人被水冲走了一公里多远，他们被当地老乡救起后，又赶忙换了干衣服继续工作。领导同志说：“该憩一憩呀！”徐家富说：“休息个啥？一干活就不冷了，赶快修好大桥，好让修路的机器材料运过去呀！”那些拉铅丝的工人们，坐着滑板，在高高的半天空的天线上滑来滑去，手累了，把胳膊靠在铁丝上，略休息一会又继续工作。员工们提出了许多合理化建议，刘兆祥建议把桥中线往北移八公尺，减少一个沉箱，一孔钢梁，节省五千万元；架设第一根拦河绳时费时七天，后来工人们想出把铁环套在铅丝绳上，由河西边对拉，就一天完成两根，工作效率提高了十三倍。这样，在今年一月上旬，英雄们就把桥墩修好，二月十二日开始架桥，很快就把桥梁架好，一列一列的载着推土机、枕木、钢轨、吊车的运料列车从这座黄河便桥上经过，往河西工地上运去。
    在乌鞘岭下，傍着终年积雪的大山，经过黄河便桥运来的几十部推土机隆隆地开动着。获得运转红旗的工人郭庆福连续四百小时未出故障。技术熟练的熊光华小队长带领全小队推土机驾驶员拖挂铲运机，他的爱人女推土机手胡友梅和他一样地在风雪里驾驶着巨大的推土机。机群的马达声吸引着赶着骆驼群的附近的藏民，他们骑在骆驼的高脊背上微笑地看着新中国机械筑路的壮景。
    在世界著名风库黑河河滩上，黑风刮起来，对面看不见人影，钻探工人就在“飞砂走石”的沙滩上坚持工作。工人王福元等想出几种新的方法维护了坑壁，不使塌陷，使工作提前半月完成，工作效率提高一倍。这些英雄们的豪语是：“万里长城不算长，新修铁路比它长，推开黄河里的冰，铲开乌鞘岭上的雪，冒着大风砂，把修建铁路的红旗插在祖国西北边疆上！”
    兰新铁路的修筑，得到西北广大人民，尤其是沿线少数民族弟兄的热烈支援。在乌鞘岭陈家沟工地，藏民藏云海带领着妻女到工地慰问测量人员。陈家沟各村藏民纷纷送麦草、鸡蛋慰问正在乌鞘岭上开筑九百多公尺长的隧道的工人们。天祝藏族自治区人民政府干部抓喜才郎跑到乌鞘岭最高峰上慰问安远号钻机工人。酒泉县祁明区的藏族干部，听到铁路测量人员来到酒泉的消息，兴奋得夜里睡不着觉，第二天一早，就赶到街上找铁路工人问：“火车几时通到这里？”藏族人民热爱这条铁路是完全可以理解的。铁路沿线有藏民呼为“八宝山”的祁连山脉和其他许多少数民族的土产、特产如药材、皮毛等。过去从酒泉把药材用大车运到兰州需时四十天，每吨货物运费需二百一十万元，加以途中的损失，使藏民区所产的甘草、羌活等药材运到内地成本昂贵，得不到销售市场。而上海两千多元一尺的细布，祁明区藏民要花五千元才能买到；江西三千元一只的细瓷碗，藏民要花一万元才能买到它。藏民们都知道：如果火车通到酒泉，仅需一天一夜即能把祁明区藏民大量出产的甘草、羌活运到兰州，运费要比过去节省许多。而上海的细布、江西的瓷碗等也能廉价地运到藏民区来。
    我沿兰新铁路兰肃段访问了不少藏民区和草滩上蒙古包里的少数民族弟兄，他们都热切地盼望着火车早日通到家门前。天祝自治区的藏民为迎接火车的到来，正在筹备开一个三万多人的赛马大会和少数民族土、特产交流大会。天祝藏族自治区成立三年来有飞跃的进步，人口从四万人增加到五万六千人，牲畜由于采用了新法养畜，从四万只羊繁殖到十三万只羊，学校也已发展到五十六个有藏文课的师范、高小、普小。新法接生训练班招收了许多藏民妇女。最近为迎接火车到来，街道上新房子在大量修建起来。天祝自治区的民主妇联主任马才错郎告诉我：“这里在解放前一百斤羊毛只能换三块茶砖，解放后能换上二十几块茶砖，去年火车通到兰州，一百斤羊毛能换上三十多块好茶砖了；如果火车通到乌鞘岭，羊毛价格能更提高，茶砖价会更下跌，以后的日子也会过得更美了！”
    我曾在这条新中国第一条通过藏民区的铁路沿线听见年青的藏民们这样唱着：
    “红色的太阳照草地，
    一心感谢毛主席，
    修路人是他派来的，
    幸福是他带来的！……”
