    Xinhua News Agency, London, 22nd: The United States is using methods such as "embargoes" and price cuts to ruin the sterling area's rubber industry.
    The United States is the main consumer of rubber in the capitalist world, and therefore has always been the largest customer of important rubber products in the sterling area. This position of the United States, coupled with the suicidal so-called "embargo" of capitalist countries, makes it possible for the United States to manipulate the rubber market of the capitalist world. After a short period of massive stockpiling after the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began to lower rubber prices and reduce purchases, which severely hit the rubber business in the sterling area. Rubber prices have fallen by nearly three-quarters from their peak in 1951.
    As a result of the U.S.'s price cuts and reduced purchases, the U.S. dollars earned by the sterling area from the sale of natural rubber have sharply decreased. According to figures published by the "Financial Times," the U.S. dollars earned by the sterling area from the sale of natural rubber were $342 million in 1950, $400 million in 1951 (due to panic buying after the outbreak of the Korean War, rubber prices reached their peak), $190 million in 1952, and this year, according to preliminary statistics, only $50 million to $55 million so far. The newspaper pessimistically predicts that dollar earnings from the sale of natural rubber in 1953 may fall to the lowest level since the war.
    The United States also shifted its purchasing targets from Malaya, the main rubber-producing area in the sterling area, to Indonesia, further lowering rubber prices in Malaya. This practice of the United States has caused serious difficulties for the British rubber industry in Malaya, which relies on American customers. The United States then took advantage of the situation and seized rubber resources in Malaya from Britain. The United States has already acquired many rubber plantations in Malaya that formerly belonged to Britain, and the acquisition work is still ongoing. The scale of the U.S. penetration into Malaya can be seen from the comparison of U.S. and British investment in Malaya. In 1952, U.S. investment in Malaya had risen to $460 million, while British investment was only $570 million.

    Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 23rd: The lives of hundreds of thousands of workers in Malaya are seriously threatened by the U.S. "embargo" policy.
    Under the blow of the United States' predatory trade policy, from the beginning of this year to the beginning of July, the price of rubber in Malaya has fallen from 89 Malayan cents per pound to 64 cents. Malayan rubber companies use continuous cuts in workers' wages to make up for the losses caused by the decline in rubber prices. In early July, the Malayan Rubber Planters' Association issued a notice regarding the reduction of rubber workers' wages. This is the fourth time in the past 18 months that Malayan rubber workers have had their wages cut. As a result of this wage cut, the wages of all Malayan rubber workers will be reduced by 4 pence per day. According to a report by the "Times" correspondent in Singapore in October last year when Malayan rubber workers had their wages cut for the third time, the minimum living expenses for a family of five at that time were 26 pounds per month, while the wages that a rubber worker and his wife could earn per month did not exceed 21 pounds at most. This renewed wage cut will make the lives of rubber workers even more impoverished.
    According to Malayan newspapers, due to the decline in the prices of rubber and tin, many industrial and commercial enterprises have gone bankrupt. Therefore, recently the "tide of unemployment has become increasingly turbulent" in Malaya. In Singapore alone, nearly 10,000 unemployed people registered with the official employment agency in the first half of this year.

### 美国用“禁运”等手段打击英镑区橡胶业  马来亚许多工商业倒闭工人生活贫困大批失业

    美国用“禁运”等手段打击英镑区橡胶业
    马来亚许多工商业倒闭工人生活贫困大批失业
    【新华社二十二日讯】伦敦消息：美国正利用“禁运”和压价等等办法来搞垮英镑区的橡胶业。
    美国是资本主义世界橡胶的主要消费者，因此也一直是英镑区重要的橡胶产品的最大主顾。美国的这种地位加上资本主义国家自杀性的所谓“禁运”，使得美国有可能操纵资本主义世界的橡胶市场。美国在朝鲜战争发生后一个短时期的大量囤购之后，就开始压低橡胶价格并减少收购，这样一抬一压，便沉重地打击了英镑区的橡胶生意。橡胶价格从一九五一年最高峰下跌了将近四分之三。
    由于美国实行压价和减购的结果，英镑区出售天然橡胶所得的美元急剧减少。据“金融时报”发表的数字，英镑区出售天然橡胶所赚得的美元在一九五零年为三亿四千二百万美元，一九五一年（由于朝鲜战争发生后的抢购，橡胶价格达到最高峰）为四亿美元，一九五二年为一亿九千万美元，而今年度，据初步统计，截至目前为止，只有五千万到五千五百万美元。该报悲观地预测一九五三年出售天然橡胶赚取的美元收入可能降为战后的最低数。
    美国并转移收购的对象，从英镑区的主要橡胶产地马来亚转到印尼，用这种办法进一步压低马来亚的橡胶价格。美国的这种做法使得仰赖美国主顾的马来亚英国橡胶业遭到严重困难，美国于是又乘虚而入，从英国手中夺取马来亚的橡胶资源。美国在马来亚已经收购了许多从前属于英国的橡胶种植园，而且收购工作仍在继续进行中。美国打入马来亚的规模可以从美英在马来亚的投资的对比中看出来，一九五二年美国在马来亚的投资已升至四亿六千万美元，而英国的投资不过五亿七千万美元。
    【新华社二十三日讯】新加坡消息：马来亚数十万工人的生活，受到美国“禁运”政策的严重威胁。
    在美国掠夺性的贸易政策的打击下，从今年年初到七月初，马来亚橡胶价格已从每磅马来亚币八角九分降到六角四分。马来亚橡胶公司用不断削减工人工资的办法来弥补由于橡胶跌价而造成的损失。七月初，马来亚橡胶种植商协会发出了关于削减橡胶工人工资的通知。这是马来亚橡胶工人在过去十八个月中第四次被削减工资。这次削减工资的结果，马来亚所有橡胶工人的工资每天都将减少四辨士。根据“泰晤士报”驻新加坡记者在去年十月马来亚橡胶工人第三次被削减工资时的报道，当时维持五口之家的最低生活费用，是每月二十六英镑，而一个橡胶工人和他的妻子每月所能赚到的工资，最多不超过二十一英镑。这次再度削减工资，就使橡胶工人的生活更加贫困。
    据马来亚报纸报道，由于橡胶和锡的跌价，很多工商业倒闭，因此，近来马来亚“失业的浪潮已日益汹涌”。仅新加坡一地，今年上半年到官方职业介绍所登记的失业者就近一万人。
