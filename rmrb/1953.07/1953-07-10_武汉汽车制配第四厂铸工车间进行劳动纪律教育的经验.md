Experiences in Labor Discipline Education at the Foundry Workshop of the Wuhan Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Fourth Factory
	Pei Ping Yi Ding

The work of strengthening and consolidating labor discipline in the Foundry Workshop of the Wuhan Automobile Manufacturing and Assembly Fourth Factory was carried out in three stages: general education, typical criticism, and construction. Each stage implemented the basic principle of adhering to ideological education and achieved good results. The experiences are as follows:

I.	Investigate the situation, find the reasons, clarify the principles, unify thinking, and conduct systematic ideological education with preparation.

In the struggle against bureaucracy, the Foundry Workshop exposed the serious situation of no one being responsible for production and lax labor discipline, and found that this was one of the important reasons why production plans could not be completed regularly. Under the instruction and assistance of the Wuhan Municipal Mechanical Industry Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the factory's Party General Branch, after research, gradually clarified its understanding that the establishment of a responsibility system must begin with strengthening labor discipline education, and decided to focus on carrying out labor discipline education in the Foundry Workshop first. Therefore, it began to investigate the bottom line of lax labor discipline in the Foundry Workshop.

In the process of investigation, the necessity of strengthening labor discipline education was further clarified. However, at this time, some cadres began to develop impetuous emotions, and individual cadres even believed that the workers were backward and had to be "rectified." In response to this ideological situation among the cadres, the workshop's Party branch carefully studied the instructions of the higher-level Party committee and referred to the experience of Tianjin in strengthening labor discipline education, focusing on analyzing that the root cause of lax labor discipline was the weakness of the Party's political and ideological work. From this, the cadres' thinking was unified: affirming that to overcome the phenomenon of lax labor discipline, it is necessary to always adhere to the principle of ideological education.

One of the more common reasons for lax labor discipline in the Foundry Workshop was that many workers did not understand the correct relationship between production and life. This was manifested in the fact that many workers emphasized wages and welfare and neglected production, made trouble over wage and welfare issues, and did not observe labor discipline. The reason why some workers had this wrong idea was that they misunderstood "being the masters of their own affairs," thinking that they had suffered enough in the old society and now that they had turned over, they could enjoy it. Some workers misunderstood planned economic construction, thinking that with the advent of economic construction, it was time to enjoy themselves.

In response to these main ideological situations, the factory's Party General Branch first conducted a systematic ideological education among Party members, members of the Communist Youth League (CYL), and cadres, clarifying the confused thinking that existed among them. Then, it conducted a more popular and practical systematic ideological education among the masses of workers, explaining: first, the great significance and arduousness of industrial construction; second, what attitude the working class should take to undertake the task of economic construction; third, in view of the lax labor discipline in the workshop, it was clearly proposed to advocate the spirit of completing production plans with a conscious labor attitude.

II. In conducting general education, the methods of calculation and recollection comparison were used.

In carrying out the above-mentioned ideological education, the method of linking with reality to enlighten the masses was used. Here are three main points of experience:

(1) It is most powerful to explain problems by means of calculation. For example, in response to the idea that emphasizing wages and welfare and neglecting production is more common among workers, explain the principle of "for every inch of production growth, there is a cent of welfare growth"; and calculate two large accounts to explain how much the state gave us and how much we gave the state: First, the number of workers in the factory increased by one-quarter in 1952 compared to 1951, but the total output value of these two years was the same, which means that the value created by each worker for the state actually decreased. This shocked the workers. Second, it was calculated that the factory's welfare and labor insurance expenses in 1952 accounted for 70 percent of the year's profits. As a result, many workers were ashamed, and in the discussion, the workers proposed: "It is not right to talk only about welfare without improving production." "In construction, we must look further ahead, and not first consider personal interests, but first endure hardship and then enjoy happiness." Five workers who used to complain about low wages, made trouble, and did not work hard quickly became actively involved in production after this education and no longer complained about low wages.

(2) The method of recollection and comparison can best enlighten workers. For example, workers from the Northeast vividly linked their suffering under Japanese imperialism, and naturally realized that "without industry, there would be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." When talking about how workers should work hard to produce and fully supply peasants with industrial products, improve the lives of peasant brothers, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, many workers from rural areas vividly linked how much they suffered when they were peasants. Many workers criticized the idea that "workers create more value and should enjoy more happiness than peasants." Some said: "Now that I stand next to the machine, I have forgotten the suffering I endured as a peasant!" When talking about how the exploiting classes forced workers to work in the old society, and the pain of workers having to work for a living, the workers felt even more deeply, realizing that working now is for everyone's happiness and cannot be compared with the past. They naturally realized the fundamental difference between labor discipline in the new and old societies.

(3) Combining with the specific situation of lax labor discipline in the factory to carry out education can best arouse the conscious ideological struggle of employees who do not observe labor discipline. One employee who changed the earliest was because the lecturer mentioned his examples of not observing labor discipline during the lecture. He did not sleep all night after returning, thinking that he only worked three or four hours a day at most, and delayed submitting the reports that should have been submitted in time for a month, which affected the workshop's production plan. He felt very ashamed. Therefore, he automatically exposed his ideological situation to the secretary of the workshop's Party branch, changed his labor attitude, and automatically rushed to fill out the backlog of reports.

III. Under the leadership of the Party, give full play to the role of the CYL organization and carry out education based on the characteristics of young workers.

Before carrying out labor discipline education, the Party, government, trade union, and CYL cadres of the Foundry Workshop carried out division of labor, led Party members, CYL members, and activists to carry out individual education, and cultivated typical examples separately. The CYL General Branch analyzed the characteristics of the ideological development of young workers after entering the production reform: First, they have a high enthusiasm for learning technology, but some young workers have an incorrect learning attitude, opposing learning technology to production, and are unwilling to do rough work, odd jobs, and heavy work, aiming too high, and some even use learning technology as an excuse to disobey command and dispatch, not observe operating procedures, and not listen to experienced workers; second, some young workers are not good at arranging their lives and have not developed labor habits, opposing production to cultural and recreational activities, and a few young workers are even lazy and love to play; third, due to the above two points, the relationship between young workers and old workers is not good, experienced workers are dissatisfied with the labor attitude of some young workers and apprentices, and a few young workers and apprentices do not humbly learn from experienced workers.

In response to the above situation, the CYL branch organized Party members and young workers to hold two discussion meetings. The first discussion was "It's not easy to have today," and Guo Wansheng, secretary of the workshop's Party branch, gave a report. Guo Wansheng used his own experience to compare his completely different labor attitudes in the new and old societies, which deeply moved the young workers; at the same time, Comrade Yin Rongfu, an outstanding CYL member, reported his advanced thinking of everything for production, and used his vivid examples of obeying dispatch, doing and learning everything, humbly learning from experienced workers, and correctly arranging his life to enlighten the young workers. The content of the second discussion was "What is happiness and what is honor?" It was mainly carried out in response to the characteristics of young workers who demand progress and love honor. This lesson mainly linked personal honor with collective honor, and in the discussion, everyone clarified that working for the great construction of the motherland and the beautiful future of young people is the greatest happiness and honor. This kind of lively education is most easily accepted by young people. After the discussion meeting, many young workers quickly changed their labor attitude.

IV. Carry out meticulous organizational work: division of labor and contracting, individual education, cultivation of typical examples, and leading the general.

The above is general education. While carrying out general education, the responsible cadres of the workshop, cadres sent to the factory, and Party members, CYL members, and activists also selected ten employees who did not observe labor discipline and carried out individual education separately, responsible for helping them change. As a result, all ten employees changed, which played a great role in enlightening and educating the masses. Here are a few points of experience:

(1) Combine general education with the cultivation of typical examples. In the process of cultivating typical examples, the situation of lax labor discipline and the ideological roots of this situation were continuously grasped, and the content of education was enriched. For example, a young worker had "four fears," namely fear of noise (the machine was loud, and he sometimes turned off the power), fear of heat (sand boxes were waiting to be used, and he was afraid of heat and would not disassemble the boxes), fear of dirt, and fear of fatigue (unwilling to do rough work, heavy work). Using such typical examples to illustrate the error of not loving labor is specific and powerful; at the same time, general education in turn promoted typical figures to launch ideological struggles, such as the transformation of the above-mentioned employee.

(2) When carrying out individual education, it is necessary to find out the specific reasons why the education target does not observe labor discipline, grasp his ideological problems, and solve them. For example, a young worker was from a poor peasant family and had performed meritorious service in the army in the past. He was very active in production when he was first transferred to the factory, but later became negative. At first, it was thought that he had a regressive idea, so he was asked: "You have performed meritorious service in fighting in the past, why don't you carry forward the glorious tradition in production?" But he rarely spoke. The second time he was asked: "How is your family life?" He said: "Very good, I got twenty acres of land and an ox, and my younger brother got married." He was asked again: "What about you?" He said: "I used to herd pigs for the landlord and suffered a lot, but now I am very comfortable." He was asked again: "How did this come about?" He paused and said: "I thank Chairman Mao." "I saw that the whole country was liberated and forgot the suffering." But this conversation did not solve his problem. Finally, it was learned that it was because he was wrongly punished in the "Three-Anti" movement. After solving this problem, he became active.

Another young worker used to make clothes, but later entered the factory. He has always been uneasy in production. Originally, the wages he earned from making clothes in the past were equivalent to the income of a fifth- or sixth-grade experienced worker, so he always felt that his income was low. After understanding, his family burden was relatively heavy, and he spent a lot of money eating odd meals in the canteen. Sometimes he did not have enough money, and he did not have a mosquito net, so he could not sleep well at night because of mosquito bites, and he was not energetic during the day. In response to this situation, in addition to opening up his thinking and encouraging him to improve his skills, the trade union group also helped him join a fixed food group for meals, and the trade union group leader also helped him buy a mosquito net. As a result, this young worker also changed.

(3) We must adhere to education and persuasion, and consolidate it after the transformation. For example, a young worker did not love labor, and many people felt that he was difficult to educate, but after great help, he initially admitted his mistakes and made some changes in his actual work. But after two days, he suddenly became worse again. At this time, there were two opinions among the cadres: one was that he could make progress and that education should be persisted in; the other was that they lacked confidence, believing that education was useless and advocating holding a conference to help him (in fact, struggle). Finally, the Party branch analyzed the young worker's materials and decided to continue individual education. The Party branch talked to the young worker again and found that after he became a typical example, some young workers joked with him, making him feel: "Anyway, everyone has a prejudice against me, and even if I improve better, others' views on me will not change." So it was pointed out that this idea of his was wrong, that he should trust the masses, that he should use practical actions to change everyone's views, and continue to encourage him, making him feel warm. Finally, his transformation was consolidated.

(4) Through typical examples, guide the masses to consciously check labor discipline and conduct ideological criticism. When the cultivated typical figures have made changes of varying degrees, select the most representative typical examples and hand over their examples of not observing labor discipline to the masses for discussion. Then, summarize the materials enriched by the masses in the discussion into several main aspects (as mentioned in point 2 of this section) to guide the masses to analyze and criticize. Then, Party members and CYL members take the lead in checking themselves in the group by comparing with typical examples (main aspects). As a result, the masses are naturally guided to check labor discipline. Each group talks about typical examples of not observing labor discipline. As a result, it is checked how many people are late, wash their hands before the end of work and wait to get off work; how many people read books and newspapers, stroll, sing operas, chat, and even fight at work; how many people are absent from work; how many people do not observe safety and technical operating procedures; how many people do not listen to dispatch; and other phenomena of not being at ease at work and damaging tools, and analyze the main reasons for these phenomena. Through mass inspection and criticism, the atmosphere in the workshop is completely new, the phenomenon of workers being absent from work without reason and being slack in work has disappeared, and labor enthusiasm is high.

The shortcoming in guiding the masses to carry out ideological criticism is that they did not focus on handing over positive good examples to everyone for discussion. Most of the discussions and criticisms were about not observing labor discipline, which made some employees feel some pressure. Moreover, if only bad examples are given, some workers with a less-than-good labor attitude feel that they are not as bad as typical examples. Therefore, when looking for typical examples, it is best to praise advanced employees who consciously observe labor discipline, introduce their advanced ideas, and guide everyone to learn from them, combined with analyzing and criticizing the wrong ideas of employees who do not observe labor discipline, and introduce their ideological transformation process. In the work of strengthening labor discipline education in the whole factory, the model Party member Guo Wansheng, who has always consciously observed labor discipline, aroused a huge response after reporting his model actions. Many people compared themselves with Guo Wansheng and asked themselves: "Why can Guo Wansheng work so consciously, but I can't?" Among the young workers, Comrade Yin Rongfu's good example also enlightened the young workers (unfortunately, it has not been focused on being handed over to the young workers for comparison and discussion). These facts all prove that the model actions and advanced ideas of advanced figures are the most enlightening and educational for the masses.

V. Promptly guide the enthusiasm of the masses to production, and take the initiative to take measures to solve practical problems and improve working conditions.

After entering the construction stage, the leadership mobilized the masses to consciously establish necessary systems and formulate labor covenants. In addition, two experiences are worth mentioning:

(1) Through labor discipline education, the ideological consciousness of the masses has been improved and labor enthusiasm has been high. It is necessary to promptly guide the masses to production. The Foundry Workshop mobilized the masses to discuss the June production plan at the end of the labor discipline inspection, and the effect was very good. For example, the trial production group reduced the scrap rate of a certain casting from the estimated 8% to 2% in the discussion, and the scrap rate of another casting from the estimated 8% to 5%, and proposed specific measures to ensure quality: 1. Use the handover shift to explain the situation and experience; 2. Carefully remove slag during casting, and do not pour if the molten iron is insufficient or not good; 3. Registrars go deep into the group to work and promote the waste product registration system to avoid wasting time in travel; 4. Young workers take the initiative to do the night shift so that experienced workers can carefully make sand molds during the day to ensure quality; do not let skilled workers do odd jobs and heavy work to give full play to their skills. The rising ring group originally estimated that it would take two hundred hours to complete the June production task. As a result, by actively proposing to change the labor organization method in the discussion, it was possible to draw two people from the group of fourteen and still ensure quality and complete the original production task. The model group compressed working hours in the plan discussion. One steel plate clip originally estimated to take six working days, but was compressed to two and a half working days after discussion. This shows that after labor discipline education, the ideological awareness of the masses has been truly improved, and the purpose of strengthening and consolidating labor discipline has been achieved (establishing a responsibility system, completing and exceeding the production plan).

(2) While carrying out labor discipline education, the leadership should pay special attention to the workers and take necessary and possible measures in a timely manner to improve working conditions, safety and sanitation. When the masses of the Foundry Workshop discussed and decided to increase the day and night shifts, they requested the factory's administrative leadership to take the following measures: 1. Add lighting equipment, adding six 200-watt lights, because the lighting equipment was insufficient in the past and it was easy to cause accidents. 2. Solve the problem of eating for the night shift. In the past, it was stipulated that everyone on the night shift would get a bowl of noodles and a steamed bun, but the Foundry Workshop had a high labor intensity and some people could not eat enough, which affected production, while workers in some workshops were full and took the steamed buns away. This time, it was decided to "manage eating but not carrying," to ensure that everyone was full; 3. Sleep is a serious problem for workers on the night shift. Many workers are not used to sleeping during the day. This time, it was decided that the trade union would find a way to ensure that workers could sleep well during the day. 4. It is stipulated that a special person will check the molten iron ladles once a day, because the heat of the molten iron is above 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, and even the slightest problem with the molten iron ladles can cause major casualties. The workers expressed great satisfaction with this initiative to care for safe production and workers' lives.

    武汉汽车制配第四厂铸工车间进行劳动纪律教育的经验
    裴平  一丁
    武汉汽车制配第四厂铸工车间，加强和巩固劳动纪律的工作，分为一般教育、典型批判和建设三个阶段进行，每一阶段都贯彻了坚持思想教育的基本方针，收到了良好的效果，其经验如下。
    一、摸情况，找原因，明确方针，统一思想，有准备地进行系统的思想教育
    铸工车间在反官僚主义斗争中，揭露了生产上无人负责和劳动纪律松弛的严重情况，发现这是经常不能完成生产计划的重要原因之一。在中共武汉市机械工业委员会的指示和帮助下，该厂党总支经过研究，逐步明确认识了建立责任制必须从加强劳动纪律教育入手，决定首先在铸工车间重点开展劳动纪律教育工作，于是就在铸工车间摸劳动纪律松弛情况的底。
    在摸底的过程中，进一步明确地认识了加强劳动纪律教育的必要，但这时部分干部开始滋长着急躁情绪，个别干部甚至认为工人落后，非“整”不可。针对干部中的这种思想情况，车间党支部又认真研究了上级党委的指示，并参考了天津市加强劳动纪律教育的经验，着重分析了劳动纪律松弛的根本原因在于党的政治思想工作薄弱。由此统一了干部思想：肯定要克服劳动纪律松弛的现象，必须始终坚持思想教育的方针。
    铸工车间劳动纪律松弛的一个比较普遍的原因，是不少工人不懂得生产和生活的正确关系，这表现在不少工人强调工资福利而忽视生产，为工资福利待遇问题闹情绪，不遵守劳动纪律。部分工人其所以有这种错误思想，是由于对“当家作主”发生了误解，认为过去在旧社会吃够了苦，现在翻了身可以享受一下了；部分工人对有计划的经济建设发生误解，认为经济建设来了，就是享福的时候到了。
    针对这些主要的思想情况，该厂党总支，首先在党、团员和干部中进行了一次系统的思想教育，澄清了党、团员和干部中存在的混乱思想。然后又在工人群众中，进行了一次更通俗、更联系实际的系统的思想教育，讲明了：第一，工业建设的重大意义和艰苦性；第二，工人阶级应该抱什么态度来担负经济建设的任务；第三，针对车间劳动纪律松弛情况，明确提出提倡以自觉的劳动态度完成生产计划的精神。
    二、在进行一般教育时，运用了算账、回忆对比的方法
    在进行上述的思想教育中，用了联系实际启发群众的办法。这里主要有以下三点经验：
    （一）用算账的方式说明问题最有力量。如针对工人中比较普遍存在的强调工资福利、忽视生产的思想，说明“生产长一寸，福利长一分”的原则；并算了两笔大账，说明国家给了我们多少东西，我们给了国家多少东西：第一，一九五二年比一九五一年全厂工人增加了四分之一，可是这两年的生产总值相等，就是说每个工人给国家创造的价值反而减少了。这使得工人们大吃一惊。第二，算出了一九五二年全厂福利劳保的开支占全年利润百分之七十。这样一来，很多工人都很惭愧，在讨论中工人就提出：“生产没提高，尽谈福利是不对的”“在建设中我们要看远些，不能先为个人打算，要先苦后甜。”有五个工人过去嫌工资低，闹情绪，不好好工作，通过这次教育，很快地就积极生产，再也不嫌工资低了。
    （二）用回忆对比的方式最能启发工人，例如来自东北的工人们，生动地联系了自己在日本帝国主义统治下受苦的情况，很自然地认识到“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”讲到工人应该努力生产，充分供给农民以工业品，改善农民兄弟的生活，巩固工农联盟时，很多来自农村的工人就生动地联系自己当农民时多么受苦，不少工人都批判了“工人生产的价值大，应当比农民享福”的思想，有的说：“我现在站在机器旁边，忘了当农民时的苦啦！”讲到在旧社会，剥削阶级怎样强迫工人劳动，工人为了生活不得不劳动的痛苦情况时，工人们更有切肤之痛，认识到现在干活是为了大家幸福，不能和以前比，很自然地认识到新、旧社会劳动纪律的根本不同。
    （三）结合本厂劳动纪律松弛的具体情况来进行教育，最能引起不遵守劳动纪律的职工进行自觉的思想斗争。有一个职员转变最早，就是因为听课时讲课人讲了他不遵守劳动纪律的事例，他回去一夜没有睡觉，想到自己一天最多只工作三四个小时，把应该及时上报的表报一压就是一个月，影响了车间的生产计划时，感到很惭愧。因此，他自动地向车间党支部书记暴露了思想情况，转变了劳动态度，自动把积压的表报赶填起来。
    三、在党的领导下，充分发挥青年团组织的作用，针对青年工人的特点进行教育
    在进行劳动纪律教育前，铸工车间的党、政、工、团的干部，进行了分工，领导党、团员和积极分子进行个别教育，分头培养典型。团总支分析了青工转入生产改革后思想发展的特点是：第一，学技术热情高，但部分青工的学习态度不正确，把学习技术和生产对立起来，不愿干粗活、零活、重活，好高鹜远，有的甚至藉口学技术，不服从指挥调度，不遵守操作规程，不听老师傅的话；第二，部分青工不善于支配自己的生活，未养成劳动习惯，把生产和文娱活动对立起来，少数青工甚至好逸恶劳，爱玩；第三，由于以上两点，造成青工、老工关系不好，老师傅不满部分青工、徒工的劳动态度，少数青工、徒工不虚心向老师傅学习的现象。
    针对以上情况，团支部组织团员、青工开了两次座谈会。第一次座谈“好不容易有今天”，由车间党支部书记郭万盛作了报告，郭万盛用自己的经历对比了他在新、旧社会的完全不同的劳动态度，深深地感动了青年工人；同时，优秀的青年团员尹荣富同志报告了他一切为生产的先进思想，并用他服从调度、做什么学什么、虚心向老师傅学习和正确支配自己的生活等活生生的事例，启发了青年工人。第二次座谈的内容是“什么是幸福，什么是荣誉？”主要是针对青年工人要求进步、爱好荣誉的特点进行的，这一课主要是把个人荣誉和集体荣誉联系起来谈，在讨论时使大家明确了为祖国的伟大建设和青年的美丽远景而劳动，就是最大的幸福和荣誉。这种生动活泼的教育，最易为青年人所接受。座谈会开过后，很多青工迅速改变了劳动态度。
    四、进行细密的组织工作：分工包干，个别教育，培养典型，带动一般
    以上是一般教育。在进行一般教育的同时，车间负责干部、下厂干部和党、团员，积极分子还选择了十个不遵守劳动纪律的职工，分头进行了个别教育，负责帮助其转变，结果这十个职工都有了转变，对启发和教育群众起了很大的作用。这里有以下几点经验：
    （一）一般教育与培养典型相结合。在培养典型中不断掌握了劳动纪律松弛的情况和产生这种情况的思想根源，丰富了教育的内容。如有个青工有“四怕”，即怕吵（机器响，他有时就把电门关了）、怕热（砂箱等着用，他怕热不拆箱）、怕脏、怕累（不愿干粗活、重活），用这样的典型事例说明不爱劳动的错误，就具体有力；同时一般教育又转过来促使典型人物展开思想斗争，如上述一个职员的转变就是如此。
    （二）在进行个别教育时，要找出教育对像不遵守劳动纪律的具体原因，抓住他的思想问题，加以解决。如有个青工是贫农出身，过去在部队里曾经立过功，开始调到厂里来时，生产也很积极，后来却消极起来。开始时，以为他有退坡思想，就问他：“你过去打仗立过功，为什么不在生产上发扬光荣传统呢？”但他很少说话。第二次又问他：“你家庭生活怎样？”他说：“很好，分了二十亩田一条牛，弟弟结了婚。”又问：“你呢？”他说：“我过去给地主放过猪，受过苦，现在很舒服。”又问：“这是怎样来的呢？”他停了一下，说：“我感谢毛主席。”“我看到全国解放了，忘了苦。”可是这次谈话还没有解决他的问题。最后，才知道是因为他在“三反”运动中错受了处分，把这个问题解决了，他就积极起来了。
    另一个青工原来是做衣服的，后来进了工厂，在生产上一贯不安心，原来他过去做衣服得的工资要抵一个五、六级老师傅的收入，因此总感到自己的收入少。经过了解，他家庭负担比较重，在食堂吃零饭花钱也比较多，有时钱不够用，又没有蚊帐，晚上蚊子咬，睡不好，白天工作没精神。针对这样情况，除了打通他的思想，鼓励他提高技术外，还由工会小组帮助他在一个固定的伙食团搭伙食，工会小组长又帮助他买了蚊帐，结果这个青工也转变了。
    （三）要坚持教育说服，有了转变还要加以巩固。如有个青工不爱劳动，不少人都觉得他难以教育，但经过大力帮助，他初步承认了错误，在实际工作中有了些转变。可是过了两天，突然他又变坏了。这时干部中有两种意见：一种是相信他能够进步，认为应该坚持教育；另一种是信心不足，认为教育没有用，主张开大会来进行帮助（实即斗争）。最后党支部分析这个青工的材料，决定还是坚持个别教育，党支部又找这个青工谈话，才发现他当了典型后，有个别青工和他开玩笑，使他感到：“反正大家对我有成见，我再改得好些，别人对我的看法还不会转变。”于是就指出他这种想法错了，应该相信群众，要用实际行动来转变大家的看法，并继续鼓励他，使他感到温暖，最后，他的转变就巩固下来了。
    （四）通过典型，引导群众自觉地检查劳动纪律，进行思想批判。当培养的典型人物已有不同程度的转变时，就选择最有代表性的典型，将其不遵守劳动纪律的事例交给群众讨论。再将群众在讨论中丰富了的材料归纳为几个主要方面（如本节第二点所述），引导群众分析批判。然后再由党、团员带头在小组中对照典型（主要方面）检查自己，结果很自然地就引导群众检查劳动纪律，每一组都谈出不遵守劳动纪律的典型事例，结果检查出迟到、没下班就提前洗手等着下班的有多少人；上班时看书报、蹓跶、唱戏、谈天以至打闹的有多少人；旷工的有多少人；不遵守安全和技术操作规程的有多少人；不听从调配的有多少人；其他不安心工作，损坏工具的有多少人，并且分析出造成这些现象的主要原因。通过群众性的检查批判，车间气象一新，工人无故缺勤和工作松懈的现象绝迹，劳动热情高涨。
    在引导群众进行思想批判时存在的缺点，是没有着重将正面的好典型交给大家讨论，所讨论批判的大都是不遵守劳动纪律的，使部分职工多少感到有些压力。而且，光拿出不好的事例，有些劳动态度不够好的工人就觉得自己还不像典型那样坏。因此，找典型时，最好是以表扬先进的自觉遵守劳动纪律的职工，介绍他们的先进思想，引导大家向他们学习为主，结合分析批判不遵守劳动纪律的职工的错误思想，并介绍他们的思想转变过程。在全厂加强劳动纪律教育的工作中，一贯自觉遵守劳动纪律的模范党员郭万盛报告了自己的模范行动后，引起了巨大的反响。很多人都拿郭万盛对照着问自己：“为什么郭万盛那样自觉地劳动，我却不能够呢？”在青年工人中，尹荣富同志的好榜样，也启发了青年工人（可惜还没有着重交给青年工人对照讨论）。这些事实，都证明先进人物的模范行动和先进思想是最能启发群众、教育群众的。
    五、及时把群众热情引向生产，并主动采取措施，解决实际问题，改善劳动条件
    转入建设阶段后，领导方面就发动群众自觉地建立必要的制度，订出劳动公约。另外，还有两条经验值得提出：
    （一）通过劳动纪律教育，群众思想觉悟提高了，劳动热情高涨，应及时把群众引向生产。铸工车间在检查劳动纪律结束时，就发动群众讨论了六月份的生产计划，效果很好。像试制组在讨论中把某铸件的报废率由估定的百分之八降低到百分之二，另一铸件报废率由估定的百分之八降低到百分之五，并提出了保证质量的具体措施：一、利用交接班时交代情况和经验；二、浇铸时仔细打渣，铁水不够、不好就不浇；三、登记员深入小组办公，推行废品登记制度，免得往返费时；四、青工主动提出做夜班，使老工人在白天精做砂型，保证质量；不让有技术的工人做杂活、重活，使之充分发挥技术。涨圈组原来估计完成六月份生产任务要差二百个小时，由于工人在讨论中主动提出改变劳动组织的办法，结果从全组十四个人中抽出两人，还能保证质量，完成原来的生产任务。模型组在讨论计划中压缩了工时，某钢板夹子一件原来估计要六个工，经讨论压缩为两个半工。这都表明经过劳动纪律教育，真正提高了群众思想觉悟，并达到了加强和巩固劳动纪律的目的（建立责任制，完成和超过生产计划）。
    （二）进行劳动纪律教育的同时，领导方面要特别关心工人，及时采取必要和可能的措施，改善劳动条件和安全卫生等工作。铸工车间在群众讨论决定增开日、夜班时，即请示该厂行政领导采取以下措施：一、增添照明设备，增加了六盏二百支光的电灯，因为过去照明设备不够，容易出事故。二、解决夜班吃饭问题，过去夜班吃饭一律规定每人一碗面一个馒头，但铸工车间干活劳动强度大，有些人吃不饱，影响生产，而有些车间的工人却吃饱了，把馒头带着走，这回决定“管吃不管带”，保证大家都吃饱；三、做夜班的工人睡眠是个严重问题，不少工人不习惯白天睡觉，这回决定由工会想法，力求做到使工人白天能睡得好。四、规定专人每天检查一次铁水包子，因为铁水热度在华氏一千四百度以上，铁水包子稍有毛病，就会产生重大伤亡事故。对这种主动关心安全生产和工人生活的措施，工人表示非常满意。
