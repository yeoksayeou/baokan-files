Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria have recently published communiques on the implementation of their national economic construction plans for the first half of 1953 or the second quarter. These countries have overfulfilled their industrial production plans for the first half of the year, and all economic sectors have achieved further development.

In industry, Polish socialist industry completed 103% of its semi-annual plan, with total industrial output increasing by nearly 16% compared to the first half of 1952. Hungarian large-scale industry (including local industry) completed 103% of its second-quarter production plan (the first quarter completed 100.5% of the plan), with total industrial output increasing by 12% compared to the second quarter of last year. Bulgaria completed 100.9% of its second-quarter total industrial output plan (the first quarter completed 101.9% of the plan). In terms of industrial labor productivity, the average labor productivity per worker in Poland increased by 11% compared to the first half of last year. Bulgaria's second-quarter labor productivity increased by 6.4% compared to the same quarter last year. The heavy industrial products of the three countries have increased significantly. In Poland, due to the overfulfillment of the semi-annual plans for metallurgy, machinery, coal mining, shipbuilding, and electric power industries, the output of pig iron, rolled metal, coal, tractors, automobiles, and many other heavy industrial products has greatly exceeded the plan. Bulgaria's electricity production in the second quarter of this year increased by 18% compared to the same quarter last year, coal by 17%, and electric motors by 82%. The light industries of these countries have also achieved further development. The departments under the Polish Ministry of Light Industry completed a total of 103% of the plan for the first half of the year. Compared with the second quarter of last year, Bulgaria's output of cotton fabrics and woolen fabrics in the second quarter of this year increased by 16% and 18% respectively.

In agriculture, the cultivated area of the three countries has increased in the first half of this year. The area of spring crops on Polish state farms this year increased by 9% compared to last year. In Hungary, the sown area of industrial crops alone increased by 18.3% compared to last year. The cultivated area of many crops in Bulgaria has also increased significantly compared to last year. The level of agricultural mechanization and collectivization in these countries has also increased. Taking Poland as an example, by June 30, the number of state machine tractor stations in Poland had increased to 377, and the amount of cultivation they had carried out had increased by 67% compared to the first half of last year. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in Poland has increased to 7,982, nearly one and a half times more than in the same period last year. From the end of June this year, the three countries have begun harvesting work based on the improved level of mechanization.

Due to the great achievements in industrial and agricultural production, the material living standards and cultural levels of the working people of Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria have also increased. The supply and consumption of food and daily necessities have increased compared to previous years. For example, the supply of meat and meat products on the Polish market in the first half of this year increased by 29% compared to the same period last year, bread by 12%, dairy products by 15%, and woolen fabrics by 12%. Bulgaria completed 100.6% of its second-quarter retail trade plan. The consumption of meat alone increased by 11.8% compared to the second quarter of last year, and woolen fabrics increased by 31%. The cultural and welfare undertakings of the three countries have achieved further development. In the first half of this year, the number of students graduating from secondary technical schools in Poland alone increased by 5% compared to the same period last year, and the number of books published increased by 36%. In the second quarter, 50,000 workers in Hungary enjoyed free or reduced-price vacations in sanatoriums, and the number of workers in Hungary enjoying social insurance also increased by 10%. The cultural and health institutions of these countries have been greatly increased.

Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: According to the Romanian News Agency in Bucharest, due to the increase in workers' production enthusiasm and technical level, as well as the improvement in the level of industrial mechanization, the labor productivity of Romanian socialist industry has been continuously improved. In the first quarter of this year, Romanian industrial labor productivity increased by 10.3% compared to the same quarter of 1952. In 1952, industrial labor productivity increased by 12.9% compared to 1951.

The continuous improvement of Romanian industrial labor productivity is primarily inseparable from the workers' labor enthusiasm and the improvement of their technical level. Currently, in every production department, workers are increasingly engaging in the upsurge of labor competition. More and more labor models and advanced workers are emerging, and workers are universally participating in advanced studies to improve their production technology level. At the end of 1952, there were 9,000 Stakhanovite workers and more than 87,000 advanced workers in Romania. Last year, 41,500 skilled workers were trained from the Labor Reserve Administration and the technical schools established by various government ministries. Under the initiative and leadership of advanced workers, the movement to learn advanced working methods has been widely launched. Many factories are promoting the advanced experience of Soviet advanced workers Kovalev, Bykov, Kolabelnikova, and Kolesov, as well as the working methods created by Romanian Stakhanovite workers Ni. Vasu, Du. Arjan, and Ye. Kishu, greatly promoting the improvement of labor productivity. Taking the transportation industry as an example, due to the adoption of advanced working methods, the labor productivity of this industrial sector in 1952 increased by 74% compared to 1940 before liberation.

The improvement of labor productivity in Romania is also the result of the improvement in the level of mechanization of industrial production. Thanks to the great assistance of the Soviet Union, the increasingly close economic cooperation with other people's democratic countries, and the steady development of Romania's own machine manufacturing industry, Romania's socialist industry is continuously acquiring high-efficiency machinery and equipment. In recent years, the metallurgical industry alone has added 7,000 modern machines. For example, in the famous Lakosi factory in Bucharest, the number of machines has increased by 25% in the past two years, and the number of modern tools has almost tripled. Last year, the factories under the Romanian Ministry of Metallurgical Industry manufactured 68 new machines, and the factories under the Ministry of Electric Power and Electrical Equipment Industry manufactured 129 new machines, supplying them to various industrial sectors. Therefore, in many industrial sectors, most of the operations that were previously performed manually have now been fully or largely mechanized, and labor productivity has been greatly improved. In addition to these large-scale mechanization efforts, small-scale mechanization, mainly caused by the rationalization movement, also plays a significant role in improving productivity. Among the 11,300 inventions and innovation suggestions adopted in various industrial departments in 1952, many were about improving and creating machines. One universal drilling machine, due to the adoption of an innovation suggestion regarding the addition of some parts, its productivity increased by 54% compared to the previous year.

    波、匈、保上半年经济建设成绩巨大
    罗马尼亚社会主义工业劳动生产率提高
    【新华社二十五日讯】波兰、匈牙利和保加利亚最近先后公布了一九五三年上半年或第二季度国民经济建设计划执行情况的公报。这些国家的上半年工业生产计划都已超额完成，各经济部门都获得了进一步发展。
    在工业方面，波兰社会主义工业完成了半年计划的百分之一百零三，工业总产量比一九五二年上半年差不多增加百分之十六。匈牙利的大规模工业（包括地方工业在内）完成了第二季生产计划的百分之一百零三（第一季完成计划百分之一百零点五），工业总产量比去年第二季增加了百分之十二。保加利亚第二季工业总产量计划完成了百分之一百零点九（第一季完成计划百分之一百零一点九）。在工业劳动生产率方面，波兰平均每个工人的劳动生产率比去年上半年提高了百分之十一。保加利亚第二季劳动生产率比去年同季提高了百分之六点四。三国的重工业产品都有很大的增加，在波兰，由于冶金、机器、采煤、造船和电力等重工业的上半年计划都已超额完成，铣铁、压延金属、煤、拖拉机、汽车和其他许多重工业品的产量都大大超过了计划。保加利亚今年第二季电力产量比去年同季增加了百分之十八，煤百分之十七，电动机百分之八十二。这些国家的轻工业也获得了进一步的发展，波兰轻工业部所属各部门上半年一共完成计划百分之一百零三。和去年第二季相比，保加利亚棉织品和毛织品今年第二季的产量分别增加了百分之十六和百分之十八。
    在农业方面，三国今年上半年的耕种面积都有增加。波兰今年国家农场春季作物的面积比去年增加了百分之九。在匈牙利，单是工业作物的播种面积就比去年增加了百分之十八点三。保加利亚许多作物的耕种面积也比去年大大增加了。这些国家农业机械化和集体化水平也提高了，以波兰为例，到六月三十日为止，波兰的国家机器拖拉机站已增至三百七十七个，它们已经进行的耕作量比去年上半年增加了百分之六十七；波兰的农业生产合作社已增至七千九百八十二个，比去年同期差不多增加了一倍半。从今年六月下旬起，三国已在提高了的机械化水平的基础上开始进行收割工作。
    由于工农业生产的巨大成就，波兰、匈牙利和保加利亚劳动人民的物质生活和文化水平也跟着提高了。食品和日用品的供应量和消费量比较往年又有了增加，例如波兰今年上半年市场上肉类和肉产品的供应量比去年同期增加了百分之二十九，面包百分之十二，乳类百分之十五，毛织品百分之十二。保加利亚第二季零售贸易计划完成了百分之一百零点六，单是肉类的消费量就比去年第二季增加了百分之十一点八，毛织品增加了百分之三十一。三国的文化和福利事业获得了进一步的发展，波兰在今年上半年，单是从中等技术学校毕业的学生就比去年同期增加了百分之五，出版的书籍增加了百分之三十六。匈牙利在第二季度已有五万工人在疗养机关免费或减费休假，匈牙利工人享受社会保险的人数也增加了百分之十。这些国家的文化和卫生机关都已大大增加了。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：由于工人生产积极性和技术水平的提高以及工业机械化水平的提高，罗马尼亚社会主义工业的劳动生产率不断提高了。在今年第一季中，罗马尼亚工业劳动生产率比一九五二年同季提高了百分之十点三。而在一九五二年，工业劳动生产率比一九五一年提高了百分之十二点九。
    罗马尼亚工业劳动生产率的不断提高，首先是和工人劳动积极性以及他们技术水平的提高分不开的。目前在每一个生产部门里，工人们愈来愈广泛地投入劳动竞赛的热潮。劳动模范与先进工人愈来愈多地涌现出来，工人们普遍参加进修，提高自己的生产技术水平。在一九五二年底，罗马尼亚的斯大哈诺夫式工人有九千人，先进工人超过八万七千人。去年从劳动后备总署和政府各部所设的各技术学校中培养出来的熟练工人有四万一千五百人。在先进工作者们的创议和带头下，学习先进工作法的运动普遍展开，许多工厂推广着苏联先进工作者郭瓦廖夫、比科夫、柯拉别尔尼科娃和科列索夫等人的先进经验，也推行着罗马尼亚斯大哈诺夫工人尼·瓦苏、杜·阿尔让和叶·基修等人创造的工作法，大大促进了劳动生产率的提高。以运输工业为例，由于采用了先进的工作方法，这个工业部门在一九五二年的劳动生产率比解放前一九四零年提高了百分之七十四。
    罗马尼亚劳动生产率的提高，同时也是工业生产机械化水平提高的结果。由于苏联的巨大帮助，由于和其他人民民主国家经济合作的日益紧密，以及罗马尼亚自己的机器制造业的稳步发展，罗马尼亚的社会主义工业不断地获得高效率的机器装备。最近几年来，单是冶金工业就增加了七千部现代化的机器。例如，布加勒斯特的著名的拉科西工厂里，过去两年中，机器的数目增加了百分之二十五，现代工具的数目几乎增加了三倍。去年罗马尼亚冶金工业部所属各厂制成了六十八种新机器，电力和电汽设备工业部所属各厂制成了一百二十九种新机器，供应各工业部门。因此，在许多工业部门中，以前大部分操作都是用手工进行的，现在已经全部或者大部实行机械化了，劳动生产率大大提高。除了这些大规模的机械化以外，主要由于合理化运动而引起小规模的机械化，也对生产率的提高起着很大的作用。一九五二年各工业部门中采用的一万一千三百件发明和革新建议中，许多都是关于改进和创制机器的。有一部万能钻床，由于采用了关于增加一些部件的革新建议，它的生产率比前一年增加了百分之五十四。
