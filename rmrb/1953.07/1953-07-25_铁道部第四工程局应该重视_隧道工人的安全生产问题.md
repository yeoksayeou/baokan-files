    The Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Should Pay Attention to
    the Safe Production of Tunnel Workers
    Reader Qian Shaowen writes: The Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways does not value the safety of workers' lives. This time, workers from the First Tunnel Team of the Bureau were excavating a pilot tunnel at the east entrance of Tunnel No. 20 in a certain location. When they had dug 600 meters into the tunnel, it was filled with smoke and lacked oxygen. In order not to delay the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, the workers continued to work in the tunnel despite the extremely difficult environment where even breathing was difficult. As a result, almost every day, one or two dozen people were poisoned by the smoke. On the evening of June 30th, within an hour and a half, all fifty-eight workers in the pilot tunnel were poisoned by the smoke, and they were vomiting yellow fluid. It took several days for them to recover. Although the workers continued to work under these circumstances, they felt extremely uneasy, their work efficiency dropped sharply, and the number of sick people increased daily. The workers repeatedly reported these situations to their superiors and requested the installation of ventilation equipment, but so far the leadership of the Fourth Engineering Bureau has not actively taken steps to solve this problem. I believe that this practice of neglecting the safety of workers' lives should be quickly corrected.

    铁道部第四工程局应该重视
    隧道工人的安全生产问题
    读者钱绍文来信：铁道部第四工程局不重视工人生命安全。该局第一隧道队工人这次在某地第二十号山洞东口挖掘导洞，当挖进六百多公尺时，洞内烟雾弥漫，氧气缺乏。工人们为了不误上级分配的任务，虽在这样呼吸都感困难的恶劣环境中，仍继续入洞工作。这样，差不多每天都有一、二十人被烟熏倒。六月三十日晚上，在一个半小时内，导洞内五十八个工人全部被烟熏倒，并且口吐黄水，隔好几天才能恢复健康。在这种情况下，工人们虽仍坚持工作，心里却极感不安，劳动效率急剧下降，病号也日有增多。工人们曾把这些情况一再向上级反映，并要求装置通风设备，但至今第四工程局领导方面仍未积极设法解决这个问题。我认为：这种忽视工人生命安全的作风应该迅速纠正。
