	Cultural Life Brief Review
	Do a Good Job in Book Distribution

	Book distribution is an important political task. As our country enters a period of planned economic construction, its importance is even greater. The work of the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore has greatly developed and achieved certain results in the past four years. However, there are still some errors and shortcomings in ensuring the supply of books and meeting the needs of readers. The most serious of these are the phenomena of forced distribution, massive stockpiling, and severe out-of-stock situations. This is the result of a lack of investigation and research into the needs of rural and urban areas, a lack of attention to the content of books, a lack of attention to the political effects of distribution, and a one-sided pursuit of numbers.

	In order to overcome these shortcomings, all employees of the Xinhua Bookstore must strive to overcome the blindness in the relationship between supply and demand, and strive to make the work scale and quality of the Xinhua Bookstore—especially the quality of work—adapt to the speed and level of national economic construction, so as to reduce blindness and strengthen planning. The head office of Xinhua Bookstore must continue to carry out the struggle against subjectivism, bureaucracy, and decentralism in its leadership work, strengthen political leadership, master and study business, and improve business efficiency. Thoroughly correct the phenomenon of forced distribution, so that this serious political mistake of being divorced from the masses will no longer occur; and ensure timely supply and do our best to meet the legitimate needs of readers. The leadership of Xinhua Bookstore should not be afraid of trouble and realize the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people in their ideology and work style, so as to do a better job in book distribution.

    文化生活简评
    做好书籍发行工作
    书籍发行工作是一项重要的政治工作。在我们国家进入有计划的经济建设时期，它的重要性更为增加了。国营新华书店的工作在过去四年中，有了很大的发展，并取得了一定的成绩。但在保证书籍供应、满足读者需要方面，还存在着一些错误和缺点。其中最严重的是强迫摊派、大量积压和严重脱销的现象。这是对农村和城市的需要状况缺乏调查研究，不注意书籍的内容，不注意发行上的政治效果，片面追逐数字的结果。
    为了克服这些缺点，新华书店全体职工必须努力克服供需关系上的盲目性，努力使新华书店的工作规模和工作质量——特别是工作质量，和国家经济建设的速度和水平相适应，以减少盲目性、加强计划性。新华书店总店必须在自己的领导工作上，继续贯彻反对主观主义、反对官僚主义和反对分散主义的斗争，加强政治领导，掌握和钻研业务，提高经营效能。彻底纠正强迫摊派的现象，使这一种严重地脱离群众的政治性的错误不再发生；并保证及时供应和尽力满足读者的正当需要。新华书店的领导方面要不怕麻烦地在思想上作风上实现忠诚为群众服务的精神，更好地做好书籍发行工作。
