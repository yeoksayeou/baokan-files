Our Great Motherland

Adopting advanced prefabricated construction methods in basic construction, movable work objects are prefabricated into finished or semi-finished products and transported to the site for installation according to the construction procedure. This not only shortens construction time but also ensures the quality of the project. These are workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company implementing prefabricated construction. They are welding a large number of steel plates, ready to be hoisted to the site for installation at any time.
