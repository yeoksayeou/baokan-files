Editor's note: Recently, we have received many inquiries from readers about the prevention and control of crop pests. The following is the reply from the Plant Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture on how to prevent and control the two pests of "Corn Borer" and "Ladybug":

Q: How to prevent and control "Corn Borer" after they occur in corn and millet seedlings? (Asked by Shu Qishuang from Lucheng, Shanxi, Kang Lin from Tongxian, Hebei, etc.)

A: Corn borer is the larva of the Asian corn borer moth and the European corn borer moth. The common people also call it "sitting worm" or "whirlwind worm". It is one of the main pests of corn and millet in North China, and can also harm cotton. A relatively effective method of prevention and control is to remove the affected seedlings in the early stage of the pest, kill the insects, so as to prevent them from transferring to harm other plants. In the spring, the seedlings can be cut off at the roots, and the remaining roots can still germinate and produce ears. During the activity and egg-laying period of the first generation of adult moths, use gauze nets to capture and pick egg masses every evening, which can also reduce the pest. The fundamental method of prevention and control is to mobilize the masses to remove millet stubble after autumn and burn it all before Qingming Festival next year to eliminate the overwintering larvae in the millet stubble and millet stalks. Millet straw reserved for livestock feed should also be crushed and flattened by the end of April to prevent overwintering insects from turning into moths and laying eggs to harm crops.

Q: How to prevent and control "Ladybug"? (Asked by Liang Tingzhen)

A: "Ladybug" is also called "flower daughter-in-law", "turtle bug", "wangba gaizi niu" or "twenty-eight-spotted ladybug". It is most harmful to solanaceous crops such as potatoes, eggplants, and tomatoes, and can also harm corn. Effective prevention and control methods are: during the adult insect activity and egg-laying period in summer, use a basin to hold water, add a little kerosene, knock the insects into the water and drown them, and crush the egg masses at any time. During the peak of the pest, when manual capture is insufficient, spray 50% wettable DDT at a concentration of 200 to 300 times, or aluminum arsenate or calcium arsenate at a concentration of 200 times. In winter, pay attention to checking the places where adult insects gather for overwintering, such as wall holes, soil wall cracks, and stone crevices in sunny places, and conduct searches to prevent harm in the coming year.

    怎样防治“钻心虫”和“花大姐”
    编者按：最近我们接到不少读者询问农作物虫害的防治方法。兹将农业部植物保护司关于怎样防治“钻心虫”和“花大姐”两种虫害的答复发表如下：问：玉米、谷苗发生“钻心虫”后应如何防治？（山西潞城舒绮双、河北通县康林等询问）
    答：钻心虫是粟螟蛾和玉米螟蛾的幼虫，老乡又叫“坐摆虫”、“旋心虫”。它是华北玉米、谷子主要虫害之一，也能为害棉花。防治方法比较有效的是在虫害的初期，拔除被害的禾苗，把虫子弄死，以免转移为害。如在春季，可将禾苗齐根剪去，留下的根还能发芽生穗。在第一代成虫（蛾子）活动产卵期，每天傍晚用纱布网兜捕并采摘卵块，也可以减轻虫害。根本的防治方法是发动群众在秋后拔除谷槎，于明年清明前全部烧毁，以消灭在谷槎、谷秸内过冬的幼虫。留作牲畜饲料的谷草亦应在四月底前全部铡碎压扁，以防过冬虫子化蛾飞出，产卵为害。
    问：怎样防治“花大姐”？（梁廷祯询问）
    答：“花大姐”又叫“花媳妇”、“乌龟虫”、
    “王八盖子牛”或“二十八星瓢虫”。它对马铃薯、茄子、西红柿等茄科农作物危害最严重，也能为害玉米。有效的防治方法是：在夏季成虫活动产卵期，用盆盛水，稍滴入煤油，将虫拍落水中淹死，并随时捣碎卵块。虫害盛期，人力捕捉不及，可喷射百分之五十可湿性滴滴涕二百至三百倍溶液或砒酸铝、砒酸钙二百倍溶液。冬季要注意检查成虫集中越冬处所，如向阳地方的墙洞、土壁裂缝、石隙等处，进行搜捕，以免来年为害。
