    Fengcheng County Bureau of Culture and Education Should Value the Teaching Work of Primary School Teachers
    Cao Xisheng and Liu Lian from Fengcheng Town Public Office in Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, wrote: The Fengcheng County People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education randomly pulls teachers to participate in social activities, which seriously affects the teaching work of schools. At the end of March this year, in order to participate in the Liaodong Provincial Games, the Bureau of Culture and Education transferred three teachers from the First Primary School of Fengcheng Town to play ball. At that time, two teachers in the school had already taken maternity leave and three teachers had taken sick leave. With the transfer of three more teachers to play ball, the teaching work was seriously affected. The chairman of the school's trade union raised objections to the county education trade union, but received no reply. Therefore, the principal had to personally take on the courses of two classes, leaving no time to inspect the work. Recently, the Fengcheng County Bureau of Culture and Education again notified these teachers who can play ball to gather at the county government to practice, causing two more classes in the First Primary School to be unable to attend classes. The Second Primary School has twenty-one classes and twenty-eight teachers, with seven sick teachers. After transferring two to play ball, there are only nineteen teachers left. This practice of randomly pulling teachers to participate in social activities has seriously affected students' learning and aroused widespread dissatisfaction among students and parents.

    凤城县文教科应当重视小学教师教学工作
    辽东省凤城县凤城镇公所曹希圣、刘联来信：凤城县人民政府文教科乱拉教师参加社会活动，严重地影响了学校的教学工作。今年三月底，文教科为参加辽东省的运动大会，就在凤城镇第一小学抽调三名教师参加打球。当时该校已有二个教师请产假，三个教师请病假，再抽调三个教师去打球，教学工作就受到严重影响。学校工会主席向县教育工会提意见，也没有答复。于是，校长只得亲自担任两个班的课程，根本就没有时间检查工作。最近，凤城县文教科又通知这几个会打球的教师集中在县政府练球，使第一小学又有两个班不能上课。第二小学二十一个班，二十八个教师有七个病号，抽调两个打球的，就只有十九个教师了。这种乱拉教师参加社会活动的做法，已经严重影响学生学习，引起了学生和家长的普遍不满。
