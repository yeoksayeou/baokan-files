    An Example of Strengthening Labor Discipline
    We can often see that in enterprises, during the central work of establishing responsibility systems, strengthening planned management, implementing work plans, and strengthening technical management, the Party organizations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League struggle to get involved. How can political work be used to strengthen production management and technical management? The "Experiences of the Casting Workshop of the Wuhan Automobile Parts and Fittings Factory No. 4 in Conducting Labor Discipline Education" published in today's newspaper provides a concrete answer to this question. Simply mobilizing the workers to expose the phenomenon of no one being responsible, or even establishing a set of systems, does not mean that everything is smooth sailing. Political work is still needed to organize and mobilize all employees to ensure that the established responsibility system can be implemented. The General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Wuhan Automobile Parts and Fittings Factory No. 4, after analyzing many past cases of no one being responsible, discovered that the phenomenon of no one being responsible was closely related to the relaxation of labor discipline. They seized upon the link of labor discipline, used mass work methods, raised the awareness of employees, consolidated labor discipline, and fundamentally guaranteed the implementation of the responsibility system. This proves that strengthening labor discipline is an important political task, and doing it well directly guarantees the role of administrative work. Their experience helps us to clearly recognize that the purpose of strengthening labor discipline is to ensure the completion of production plans, and to solve the central problems that need to be solved in current production by rectifying labor discipline. If we deviate from the current central work and carry out labor discipline education in isolation, it will become aimless and will not be able to play its due role.
    Labor discipline itself is coercive. However, the experience of the Automobile Parts and Fittings Factory No. 4 also tells us that to strengthen labor discipline, we should not rely on any coercive means, but rather implement the policy of adhering to education. Only by adhering to the policy of education can we fully mobilize the masses and make labor discipline the conscious discipline of the working masses. The reason why the labor discipline education in the casting workshop of the Automobile Parts and Fittings Factory No. 4 was successful is because they clearly recognized the policy of education, understood the ideological situation of the employees, carried out ideological education in a prepared manner, and on the basis of general education, grasped the characteristics of workers from different backgrounds, carried out individual education, and cultivated typical examples to drive the general. They used this set of leadership methods to carry out communist education in conjunction with reality, enlightened the working masses, recognized the fundamental difference between labor discipline in the old and new societies, recognized the correct relationship between improving production and improving life, and criticized various erroneous ideas through the examples of typical figures. In this way, after persuasive education, they laid the foundation for the vast majority of the masses to consciously abide by labor discipline. At this time, if there are still individual elements who repeatedly refuse to be reformed and deliberately disrupt labor discipline, the leadership should give them the due punishment to force them to abide by labor discipline, which will win the support of the working masses. The superiority of our social system has given us the conditions to enlighten workers to establish conscious labor discipline. Our enterprise leaders must recognize this truth and seize the work of education. The impatient mood of regarding workers as backward and thinking that they must be rectified comes from the erroneous idea of not recognizing this truth, not relying on the masses, and not believing in the masses.
    While emphasizing labor discipline, we must also care about the lives of workers and improve working conditions. May I ask, if an enterprise leader only requires workers to carry out selfless labor without caring about their safety and lives, what kind of problem is this? Workers are the most valuable property of the country, they are our own brothers and sisters, and disregarding their safety and lives is an act of forgetting the fundamentals and losing the class stand! The casting workshop of the Automobile Parts and Fittings Factory No. 4 promptly added lighting equipment, solved the problems of eating night meals and getting a good night's sleep on the night shift, strengthened labor protection work, and established a system of checking the molten iron ladle once a day. This is precisely using facts to educate the workers and enhance their understanding of the unity of national interests and personal interests.
    We believe that the experience of the Automobile Parts and Fittings Factory No. 4 in strengthening labor discipline is relatively good and is an example of political work in enterprises. Everyone should understand their experience from the above three aspects and apply it according to the specific circumstances.

### 加强劳动纪律的一个榜样

    加强劳动纪律的一个榜样
    我们常常可以看到，在企业中进行建立责任制、加强计划管理、贯彻作业计划、加强技术管理等等中心工作的时候，党的组织、工会和青年团，苦于插不进手去。怎样用政治工作来加强生产管理和技术管理工作呢？今天报上发表的“武汉汽车制配第四厂铸工车间进行劳动纪律教育的经验”，具体地回答了这个问题。发动工人群众揭发了无人负责现象，甚至建立了一套制度，并不等于万事亨通了，还需要政治工作来组织和动员全体职工，保证建立起来的责任制度能够贯彻执行。中共武汉汽车制配第四厂总支委员会，在分析了过去许多无人负责现象之后，发现了无人负责现象和劳动纪律的松弛，有着密切的关系。他们就抓紧了劳动纪律这个环节，运用群众工作方法，提高了职工的觉悟，巩固了劳动纪律，从根本上保证了责任制的贯彻。这证明加强劳动纪律是一项重要的政治工作，做好了它，就直接起了保证行政工作的作用。他们的经验，帮助我们明确认识了加强劳动纪律的目的，是在于保证完成生产计划，通过整顿劳动纪律，去解决当前生产上所要解决的中心问题。如果离开了当前中心工作，孤立地去进行劳动纪律的教育，就会变成无的放矢，发挥不了应有的作用。
    劳动纪律本身是有强制性的。但汽车制配第四厂的经验，又告诉了我们，要加强劳动纪律，却不是靠什么强制的手段，而是贯彻坚持教育的方针。只有坚持教育的方针，才能充分发动群众，使劳动纪律变成工人群众自觉的纪律。汽车制配第四厂在铸工车间进行劳动纪律的教育，所以得到成功，就是由于他们确定地认识了教育的方针，摸清了职工思想情况，有准备地进行思想教育，并在一般的教育基础之上，掌握不同出身的工人的特点，进行个别教育，培养典型，带动一般。他们运用了这一套的领导方法，进行了结合实际的共产主义教育，启发了工人群众，认识到新旧社会劳动纪律的根本不同，认识到提高生产和提高生活的正确关系，通过典型人物的事例，批判了各种错误思想。这样，他们经过了说服教育，就打下了绝大多数群众自觉遵守劳动纪律的基础。这时候，如果再有屡教不改，故意破坏劳动纪律的个别分子出现，领导上即予以应有的处分，强制他遵守劳动纪律，就会获得工人群众的拥护。我们的社会制度的优越性，赋予了我们能够启发工人建立自觉的劳动纪律的条件，我们的企业领导者，就要认识这个道理，抓紧进行教育工作。那种把工人看成落后的，认为非整一下不可的急躁情绪，正是由于不认识这个道理，不依靠群众，不相信群众的错误思想而来的。
    强调劳动纪律的同时，我们还必须关心工人的生活和改善劳动条件。试问，如果一个企业领导者，只要求工人进行忘我的劳动，而不关心工人的安全和死活，是什么性质的问题呢？工人是国家最宝贵的财产，是我们的亲手足，不顾他们的安全和生活，岂不是忘本的行为和丧失阶级立场的行为吗？汽车制配第四厂铸工车间，及时地增添了照明设备，解决了吃夜餐、夜班睡好觉等问题，加强劳动保护工作，建立每天检查一次铁水包的制度，正是用事实教育了工人，提高工人对于国家利益和个人利益一致性的认识。
    我们认为汽车制配第四厂加强劳动纪律的经验，是比较好的，是企业中政治工作的一个榜样。大家要从上述三个方面去领会他们的经验，根据具体情况，加以运用。
