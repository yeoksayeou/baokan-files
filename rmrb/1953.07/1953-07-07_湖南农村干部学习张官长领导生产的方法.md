    Hunan Province's many rural cadres are learning the working methods of Zhang Guanchang, the head of the first district of Liuyang County, to improve their leadership of agricultural production. After the Xiangtan Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a decision on May 5 regarding learning Zhang Guanchang's working methods, the newspapers of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and many local committees successively launched discussions on the issue of leading agricultural production, centered on learning Zhang Guanchang's working methods. Expanded cadre meetings held in Xiangtan, Ningxiang, Liling, Guzhang, and other counties, all reviewed local rural work by studying Zhang Guanchang's working methods. Many cadres at the meetings stated that they must earnestly improve their leadership in the future, and that all work should proceed from the actual situation and the needs of the masses at that time and in that place. Cadres in Sanhe Township, Wangcheng County, studied the current urgent demand of farmers for drought resistance and seedling protection, and within three days mobilized farmers to use more than seventy dragon bone waterwheels to draw water for irrigation, while also carrying out the work of accumulating grass and ash fertilizer to prevent lodging of seedlings. Cadres in various districts and townships in Anren County paid close attention to learning from Zhang Guanchang's ability to educate the masses with their own personal experiences. During spring plowing and production, they used agricultural gaps and evenings to hold symposiums for elderly farmers, extensively exchanging production experience, achieving local material acquisition and on-the-spot promotion of advanced farming techniques. Although Li Xingba and Heyetang in Fanshen Township, Wangcheng County, established a water management system last year, it actually became a mere formality, thus subjecting more than 700 mu of farmland to varying degrees of drought. This year, after the township cadres learned Zhang Guanchang's working methods, they carefully inspected these two ponds and dams. Through clearing work and settling accounts, they collected three dan and six dou of water-watching grain to give to the water managers, and rectified the water management system. Now, every field is full of water, and the seedlings are growing vigorously. Zhang Qihu, a Miao cadre in the fourth district of Guzhang County, wrote to the editorial department of the Xiangxi Unity Daily, introducing that after learning Zhang Guanchang's working experience of "individual mobilization and chain promotion," he had reduced many unnecessary meetings; the enthusiasm of farmers for production had been improved, and he himself had begun to "delve into" and settle down to rural work.

    湖南农村干部学习张官长领导生产的方法
    湖南省许多农村干部学习浏阳县第一区区长张官长的工作方法，改进对农业生产的领导。五月五日，中共湘潭地方委员会发出关于学习张官长工作方法的决定后，中共湖南省委员会和许多地方委员会的报纸都先后以学习张官长工作方法为中心，开展关于领导农业生产问题的讨论。湘潭、宁乡、醴陵、古丈等县召开的县、区扩大干部会议，都通过学习张官长工作方法，检查了当地的农村工作。许多干部在会上表示今后一定要切实改进领导，一切工作从当时当地的实际情况和群众的需要出发。望城县三合乡干部研究了当前农民的迫切要求是抗旱保苗，三天内就动员农民用七十多部龙骨水车车水灌田，同时开展积草木灰肥料的工作，以防止禾苗倒伏。安仁县各区、乡干部对张官长善于以群众亲身体验去教育群众这一点，很注意学习。他们在春耕生产中利用农隙和晚间召开老年农民座谈会，广泛交流生产经验，做到了就地取材，就地推广先进耕作技术。望城县翻身乡的李兴坝和荷叶塘，去年虽然建立了管理用水制度，但实际上却流于形式，因而使七百多亩农田仍受到不同程度的旱灾威胁。今年该乡干部学习张官长工作方法后，就认真检查了这两个塘坝。通过清工结账，他们收集了三石六斗看水谷给管水人，并整顿了管理用水制度。现在，每丘田水都满满的，禾苗长得很茁壮。古丈县第四区苗族干部张其瑚给湘西团结报编辑部写信，介绍他学习张官长“个别发动、串连推广”的工作经验后，已减少了许多不必要的会议；农民生产积极性提高了，他自己也开始“钻进去”，安心农村工作了。
