Basic construction tasks in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City are quite heavy this year. Guangdong Province's construction task amounts to 400,000 square meters, equivalent to seven or eight times that of last year; Guangzhou City's task amounts to more than 170,000 square meters, equivalent to four or five times that of last year. Moreover, the structure of the projects is complex and the types are diverse. In the first half of this year, the relevant basic construction departments were mostly busy completing projects carried over from the previous year, pushing most of the new projects to the second half of the year for construction. Therefore, the basic construction tasks in the second half of the year appear even more arduous. The Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Construction Engineering Bureau, anticipating this situation, have arranged the projects in order of priority and are carrying out construction in a planned manner.

    This year, Guangdong Province's important construction projects include the new construction and expansion of factories such as machinery factories, silk reeling factories, sugar factories, tea factories, ship refueling stations, and ship lighter factories. In addition, there are workers' hospitals, sanatoriums, clubs, workers' dormitories, and municipal construction projects in various cities. The most extensive basic construction in Guangzhou City is for institutions of higher learning, including the new construction or expansion of the South China Institute of Technology, the South China Agricultural College, the South China Medical College, and the South China Normal College. The buildings of the South China Institute of Technology include practice factories, high-intensity battery laboratories, and chemical experiment rooms.

    In order to ensure the completion of basic construction projects within the scheduled time, the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Construction Engineering Bureau has reorganized the construction forces to better suit the needs of construction. The staff are working hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Employees of the Guangzhou City Construction Engineering Company have been experimenting with the Soviet "prefabricated concrete floor slab" method and have achieved initial success, increasing work efficiency by more than one-third. They are now summarizing their experience and preparing for full-scale promotion. The design company affiliated with the Guangdong Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau has been studying advanced Soviet methods in concrete design and wood structure design.

    Preparations for the supply of building materials have also been stepped up. Bricks, tiles, stones, steel bars, and other materials have been stored in large quantities. Materials have been successively transported to the construction sites in Guangzhou City.

    In view of the serious shortcomings of weak leadership on construction sites in the past, unclear responsibilities, and the absence of systems, leading to a state of confusion, the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Construction Engineering Bureau has paid special attention to strengthening leadership on construction sites to make the leadership organizations more suitable for production.

    Currently, many projects have commenced one after another in the order of their arrangement.

    广东省、广州市基本建设工程陆续开工
    今年广东省、广州市基本建设任务相当繁重，广东省施工任务达四十万平方公尺，相当去年的七、八倍；广州市达十七万多平方公尺，相当于去年的四、五倍；而且工程的结构复杂，种类繁多。各有关基本建设部门今年上半年多忙于完成跨年度工程，把大部分新工程都推到下半年施工，因此下半年的基本建设任务就更显得繁重。广东省、广州市建筑工程局估计到这一情况，已按工程轻重缓急排好了队，有计划地进行施工。
    广东省今年重要的建设有机械厂、缫丝厂、糖厂、茶厂、船油站、船驳厂等工厂的新建和扩建工程。此外，还有工人医院、疗养院、俱乐部、工人宿舍，和各城市的市政建设工程。广州市基本建设规模最宏大的是高等学校，有新建或扩建的华南工学院、华南农学院、华南医学院、华南师范学院等，华南工学院的建筑包括实习工厂、强化电池实验室、化工试验室等。
    为了保证基本建设工程在预定时间内完成，广东省、广州市建筑工程局已将施工力量进行重新编队，使能更适合施工需要。职工们正努力学习苏联先进经验，广州市建筑工程公司职工试行苏联“预制混凝土楼板”方法，已获得初步成功，提高工作效率三分之一以上，现正总结经验，准备全面推广。广东省建筑工程局所属设计公司在混凝土设计、木结构设计方面，已经学习苏联的先进方法。
    建筑材料的供应准备工作，也已加紧进行。砖、瓦、石、钢筋等已大批贮存。广州市各工地现场已陆续运进材料。
    鉴于过去工地领导薄弱，职责不明，没有制度，形成混乱状态的严重缺点，广东省、广州市建筑工程局特别注意了加强工地领导，使工地领导机构更适合于生产。
    现在，许多工程已按照排列次序先后开工。
