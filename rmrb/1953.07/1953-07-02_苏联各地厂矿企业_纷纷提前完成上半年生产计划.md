    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 1st: Reports of factories and mines throughout the Soviet Union fulfilling their first half of 1953 production plans ahead of schedule are pouring in. The workers of the blast furnace workshop at the Kuznetsk Stalin Steel Plant have already completed their first half production plan ahead of schedule due to the excellent utilization of equipment. The average effective volume utilization coefficient of all blast furnaces in the workshop was 0.775, compared to 0.805 last year. The average utilization coefficient of the best No. 3 blast furnace was further reduced to 0.748. In the first half of the year, the blast furnace workshop saved raw materials and fuel worth a total of 2.83 million rubles, of which No. 3 blast furnace accounted for 1.2 million rubles. The blast furnace workshop of the Molotov City Chusovaya Steel Plant completed its first half plan five days ahead of schedule, producing several thousand tons more pig iron than in the same period last year. The production capacity of the plant's open hearth furnaces has greatly increased, with 1.17 tons more steel produced per square meter of furnace bottom area than in the same period last year. Some outstanding steelmakers have increased production by 900 to 1,000 tons of steel in the first half of the year. Miners at the Lenin Mine of the Ural Kisel Coal Mine, due to working according to instruction charts and increasing mechanization, completed their annual guarantee in six months—overproducing fifty train cars of coal. In the first half of this year, the mine saved 750,000 rubles in cost reduction alone. The Chistyakovo Coal Mine in Stalino has completed its semi-annual plan three days ahead of schedule due to workers' full use of machinery and equipment, with each coal mining combine averaging more than 1,000 tons of additional coal production. In the past two and a half months, the miners' coal production has increased by one-third. They also guarantee to overproduce tens of thousands of tons of anthracite coal before Miner's Day (August 30). The Karaganda Coal Mine completed its first half plan on June 29; fifteen coal pits have exceeded their expected production capacity, reaching the production level of the final year (1955) of the Five-Year Plan. Workers at the Bashkir Oil Company completed their first half plan on June 28, with oil production increasing by 21 percent compared to the same period last year. In the first five months of this year, they accumulated several million rubles beyond the planned target. The average daily oil production level of the Tuimaza Oil Trust workers in the first half of this year has increased by more than 30 percent, and costs have been reduced by 2 percent. They guarantee to overproduce tens of thousands of tons of oil this year. In Moscow, the Ilyich Factory also completed its first half plan eight days ahead of schedule, and overproduced several hundred generators, reducing costs by 2 million rubles more than planned. Four hundred advanced workers at the factory have completed their annual or even five-year plan tasks. In addition, the Dynamo Factory, the Second Ball Bearing Factory, the "Red Weaver" Factory, the "Light of Freedom" Factory, the Carburetor Factory, and others have also completed their first half plans four to ten days ahead of schedule.

    苏联各地厂矿企业
    纷纷提前完成上半年生产计划
    【新华社莫斯科一日电】苏联各地纷纷传来提前完成一九五三年上半年生产计划的捷报。库兹涅茨克斯大林钢铁厂高炉车间的工人们，由于很好地利用设备，上半年的生产计划已经提前完成了。全车间高炉的有效容积利用系数平均为零点七七五，而去年为零点八零五。最优秀的第三号高炉平均利用系数更降低到零点七四八。在上半年中，高炉车间节约原料和燃料的价值，共折合二百八十三万卢布，其中第三号高炉就占一百二十万卢布。莫洛托夫城楚索瓦雅钢铁厂的高炉车间，已经提前五天完成了上半年计划，比去年同期多生产了几千吨生铁。该厂平炉的生产能力已有了很大的提高，每平方公尺炉底面积比去年同期多生产一点一七吨钢。有些优秀的炼钢工人在半年内增产了九百吨到一千吨钢。乌拉尔基塞尔煤矿列宁矿坑的矿工，由于按指示图表进行工作和提高机械化程度，在六个月中就完成全年的保证——超额生产了五十列车煤。在今年上半年，该矿坑仅减低成本一项就节约了七十五万卢布。斯大林诺的契斯甲科沃煤矿，由于工人们充分使用机器设备，已提前三天完成了半年计划，每台采煤联合机平均增产一千吨以上的煤。两个半月来，矿工们的采煤量已提高三分之一。他们并保证在矿工节（八月三十日）前超额生产几万吨无烟煤。卡拉干达煤矿已在六月二十九日完成了上半年计划；有十五个煤坑已超过预计的生产能力，达到了五年计划最后一年（一九五五年）的生产水平。巴什基尔石油公司的工人，在六月二十八日完成了上半年计划，采油量比去年同期提高了百分之二十一，在今年头五个月，他们超计划积累了几百万卢布。土伊马札石油托拉斯工人今年上半年的每昼夜平均采油水平，已提高了百分之三十以上，成本减低了百分之二，他们保证今年超额生产几万吨石油。在莫斯科，伊里奇工厂也提前八天完成了上半年计划，并超额生产几百台发电机，超计划减低成本二百万卢布。该厂有四百个先进工人完成了全年甚至五年计划的任务。另外，狄纳莫工厂、第二球轴承工厂、“红色织呢者”工厂、“自由之光”工厂、碳化器工厂等，也都提前四天到十天完成了上半年计划。
