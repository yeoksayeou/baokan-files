	Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shanxi Cotton Region Leading Organs
	Vigorously Lead Farmers to Eliminate and Treat Cotton Aphids and Other Pests

	Party and government leading organs at all levels in the cotton-growing areas of Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces are vigorously leading farmers to eliminate and treat cotton aphids, red spiders, and other pests.

	Since the beginning of summer, cotton aphids and other pests have become widespread in the cotton fields of Jiangsu and the other two provinces. On June 18, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government instructed the people's governments at all levels in the cotton-growing areas to resolutely implement the pest control policy of "early treatment, universal treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment," and to dispel the paralysis of some cadres and farmers who think "treating a lot is not as good as treating a little." It also instructed to value and promote the farmers' pest control experience, cultivate farmer pest control backbones, and rapidly carry out pest control work. Following this, the cooperatives in the province transported a large number of pest control medicines and machinery to the cotton areas, and the People's Bank also issued pest control loans in the cotton areas. At present, farmers in various parts of the cotton region have taken action. The head of the fourth district of Tongshan County personally went to the fields to control pests, motivating farmers throughout the district. Pang Jun, secretary of the CPC Handan Prefectural Committee of Hebei Province, Shi Ziming, deputy secretary, and Wu Mingsheng, deputy commissioner of the Handan Administrative Office, and other responsible cadres led more than 100 cadres to Wu'an, Cheng'an and other counties with more serious pest infestations to inspect and help farmers eliminate pests. The cooperatives, agricultural supply stations, and technical instruction stations in Handan Prefecture also promptly supplied farmers with medicines and machinery and taught pest control techniques. Members of the CPC Hongdong County Committee of Shanxi Province also went deep into various districts to lead pest control. After five districts in Hongdong County convened representative meetings of mutual aid groups, pest control work was rapidly launched, and more than 85 percent of the cotton fields have now eliminated cotton aphids.

    江苏河北山西棉区领导机关
    大力领导农民除治棉蚜等虫害
    江苏、河北、山西三省种棉地区各级党、政领导机关，正大力领导农民除治棉蚜、红蜘蛛等虫害。
    入夏以来，江苏等三省棉田普遍发生棉蚜等虫害。江苏省人民政府在六月十八日指示棉区各级人民政府坚决贯彻“早治、普遍治、连续治、彻底治”的治虫方针，打消部分干部和农民“治多不治少”等麻痹思想，重视和推广农民的治虫经验，培养农民治虫骨干，迅速开展治虫工作。接着，该省合作社就将大批治虫药械运往棉区，人民银行也在棉区发放治虫贷款。目前，棉区各地农民已纷纷行动起来。铜山县第四区区长亲自下田治虫，带动了全区农民。中共河北省邯郸地方委员会书记庞均、副书记师自明和邯郸专署副专员武明圣等负责干部，带领一百余名干部分别到虫害较严重的武安、成安等县，检查和帮助农民除虫。邯郸专区的合作社、农业供应站、技术传授站等，也对农民及时供应药械和传授治虫技术。中共山西省洪洞县委员会各委员也深入各区领导治虫。洪洞县五个区分片召开互助组代表会议后，治虫工作迅速展开，现已有百分之八十五以上的棉田消灭了棉蚜。（新华社）
