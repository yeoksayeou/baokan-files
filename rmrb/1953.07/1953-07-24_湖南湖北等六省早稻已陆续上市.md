Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Early rice from Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces has successively entered the market. In May and June, some farmers in these provinces sold a large amount of wheat, and now they are beginning to sell rice, one of their main crops. Local state-owned grain departments and cooperatives have concluded wheat purchasing and are now purchasing early rice.

It is estimated that more than 80% of the early rice can be harvested in the entire Central and Southern China region this year. Hubei's early rice has had a bumper harvest this year. According to some typical preliminary investigations, the highest yield per mu can reach 550 jin, and the average yield per mu is about 368 jin. Hunan's early rice production increased by 10% compared to previous years. Guangdong Province is confirmed to have a bumper harvest of early rice this year. The total output of early rice in Jieyang County increased by 15% compared to last year, and the early rice in Yuhu District of this county increased by 33% compared to last year. Early rice production in Yongning and Hengxian counties in Guangxi can also increase by 10%. Fujian in East China also had a bumper harvest of early rice this year.

While various regions were having bumper harvests of early rice, state-owned commercial departments adjusted the cotton-grain price ratio and reduced the price difference between agricultural products and various industrial products. According to a survey in Shima, a major rice-producing area in southern Fujian, calculated based on the current price of newly marketed early rice, each 100 jin of rice can be exchanged for 0.216 bolts of Longtou fine cloth, an increase of 8.54% compared to the same period last year. Compared with the price of fertilizer, each 100 jin of early rice can be exchanged for 33.5 jin of fertilizer, an increase of 18.37% compared to the same period last year. Because the prices of industrial products have been lowered and the prices of grain have been raised, the actual price of grain in Fujian Province this year will increase by 9.45% compared to last year. These measures will stimulate farmers to increase grain production, thereby increasing the amount of grain farmers sell.

In addition to already beginning to purchase early rice on the market, the state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in the above-mentioned regions are actively preparing to meet the high tide of grain marketing. Grain departments in Hubei, Guangdong, and other places have held special meetings to arrange this work. In order to formulate a practical early rice purchase plan, Hubei Province convened a meeting of business section chiefs of grain bureaus in early rice producing areas to investigate and study the early rice production situation, and held a provincial grain storage and transportation conference to discuss strengthening grain storage and transportation work. Financial and economic departments at all levels in Zhejiang Province attach importance to the supply work during procurement. Relevant state-owned specialized companies and cooperatives have formulated supply plans based on investigations of farmers' needs for materials, and have begun procurement and allocation. The Ningbo Purchasing and Supply Station of the Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company processed a large number of checkered fabrics favored by local farmers. The planned supply of cotton cloth by the station in the third quarter increased by 150% compared to the same period last year.

### 湖南湖北等六省早稻已陆续上市

    湖南湖北等六省早稻已陆续上市
    【新华社二十日讯】湖南、湖北、广东、广西、福建、浙江等省的早稻已陆续上市。五六月份，这些省份的一部分农民曾大量出售了小麦，现在开始出售他们的主要农作物之一的稻谷。当地国营粮食部门和合作社收购小麦已告一段落，目前正收购早稻。
    估计今年中南全区早稻可收八成以上。湖北早稻今年丰收，据一些典型的初步调查，每亩最高产量可达五百五十斤，每亩平均产量在三百六十八斤左右。湖南早稻比往年增产一成。广东全省今年早稻丰收已定。揭阳县早稻总产量比去年增产一成半，这个县渔湖区早稻比去年增产百分之三十三。广西邕宁、横县等地早稻也可增产一成。华东区的福建早稻今年也获得了丰收。
    各地早稻丰收的同时，国营商业部门调整了棉粮比价并缩小了农产品和各种工业品的差价。据福建南部主要产米区石码的调查，按目前当地新上市的早稻价格计算，今年每百斤稻谷可换龙头细布零点二一六匹，较去年同期增加了百分之八点五四。和肥田粉的价格比较，每百斤早稻可换肥田粉三十三斤半，比去年同期增加了百分之十八点三七。因为工业品价格调低和粮食价格调高，福建省今年的粮食实价将比去年提高百分之九点四五。这些措施，都将刺激农民增产粮食，从而增加农民出售粮食的数量。
    上述地区的国营粮食部门和合作社除了已开始收购上市的早稻外，正积极准备迎接粮食上市的高潮。湖北、广东等地粮食部门都召开专门会议布置了此项工作。湖北省为了制订切合实际的早稻收购计划，曾召集早稻产区粮食局经营股长会议，调查研究早稻产量情况，并召开了全省粮食储运会议，讨论加强粮食保管和调运工作。浙江省各地财经部门重视收购中的供应工作，有关国营专业公司和合作社根据对农民需要物资的调查，订出供应计划，并已开始采购和调拨。花纱布公司宁波采购供应站加工了大批当地农民喜欢的格子布，该站第三季度棉布计划供应量比去年同期增加了一倍半。
