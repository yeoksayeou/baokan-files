　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 16th: After the Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway was opened to traffic, the exchange of materials in the Northwest region, with Lanzhou as the center, became increasingly active.

　　The Northwest region has more than 500 kinds of local and special products, among which products such as fur, bristles, licorice root, and casings are supplied to domestic and foreign markets in large quantities. In the past, these products mainly relied on highway transportation from Xi'an to Lanzhou. Although the majority of automobiles in the Northwest region were concentrated on the Xi'an-Lanzhou highway, the transportation capacity was still insufficient, and some products could not be smoothly transported out of the country due to high freight costs. Qinghai Provincial Trade Company and Gansu Animal Husbandry Company often accumulated 600,000 to 700,000 jin of wool needed by various regions. Farmers in the area west of the Yellow River in Gansu burned licorice root as firewood because transportation was not smooth. Highway transportation also could not guarantee the supply of a large number of machinery and equipment needed for Northwest construction and industrial products needed by various ethnic groups.

　　After the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, material exchange in the Northwest region began to become active. Tens of millions of tons of local and special products are concentrated along various highways to the railway line and transferred to various parts of the country. This year, the planned transportation volume of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is more than ten times the transportation volume of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway last year. Now, an average of eight trains, fully loaded with goods, run day and night. The main items transported out are oil, fur, medicinal materials, etc., and the main items transported in are building materials, steel products, wood, cloth, tea bricks, and various daily-use industrial products. In the past, the highway could not transport 50-ton bridge-building vehicles and more than 60-ton finished cement bridge structures, but now they can be transported by train, which plays a huge role in continuing to build railways and highway networks in the Northwest.

　　Railway transportation reduces the freight cost of various materials by one-half to two-thirds compared with highway freight rates, and the transportation time is shortened by more than half. This has brought benefits to the people of the Northwest, and their lives have gradually improved. The Northwest trade departments have planned to reduce the prices of 57 major industrial products in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang and other provinces by 1.1% to 6.5%. The price of wool in the producing areas has also been appropriately adjusted. In Xining City, Qinghai Province, 23 jin of wool could be exchanged for one bolt of white cloth before the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, but now 21 jin of wool can be exchanged for one bolt of cloth. The famous wool products of Qinghai and Gansu provinces are no longer stockpiled. The freight cost of licorice root transported by train is more than two-thirds lower than that of automobile transportation, thus opening up sales channels. The oil from Yumen, after being transported by rail, has lowered oil prices in Xi'an and other places. Gangu County does not produce coal. In the past, residents burned firewood transported from 40 kilometers away. Now, cheap coal is continuously transported by train, and burning coal saves three-quarters of the cost compared to burning firewood. 70% of the residents of Gangu County have switched to using coal stoves. Sugarcane and pineapples from Guangdong are also transported to Lanzhou by train.

　　In order to further activate material exchange in the Northwest region and improve the lives of people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, the Northwest is building many new highways to cooperate with railway transportation and further activate material exchange in the Northwest region. Five highways from Lanzhou to Xiahe, the largest fur distribution center in the Tibetan areas of southern Gansu, have been rebuilt and newly completed. Five highways from Lanzhou to Minxian, the largest medicinal material distribution center in Gansu, and from Tianshui to Zhangjiachuan, a fur distribution center, are under construction.

### 天兰铁路通车后西北区物资交流日趋活跃

    天兰铁路通车后西北区物资交流日趋活跃
    【新华社西安十六日电】  陇海铁路天（水）兰（州）段通车后，以兰州为中心的西北地区物资交流日趋活跃。
    西北地区土产品和特产品有五百多种，其中如皮毛、猪鬃、甘草、肠衣等供应国内外市场的数量很大。过去这些产品主要依靠西安到兰州的公路运输。虽然西兰公路上集中了西北区的大部分汽车，但运输力仍嫌不足，并且因运费过高，某些产品不能畅运出境。青海省贸易公司和甘肃畜产公司经常积压着六、七十万斤为各地需要的羊毛；甘肃黄河以西一带的农民因甘草运输不畅而当作柴烧。公路运输对西北建设所需要的大批机械器材和各族人民需要的工业品也不能保证供应。
    天兰铁路通车后，西北区的物资交流开始活跃起来。成千万吨的土产品和特产品顺着各公路集中到铁路线上，转运全国各地。今年天兰铁路的计划运输量等于西兰公路去年运输量的十倍以上。现在每天平均有八列火车满装着货物日夜不停地行驶着。运出的主要是石油、皮毛、药材等，运入的主要是建筑材料、钢铁制品、木材、布匹、茶砖及各种日用工业品。过去公路不能运输的五十吨重的架桥车，六十多吨重的水泥桥梁成品，现在可以用火车装运，这对继续修建西北铁路线和公路网起着巨大作用。
    铁路运输使各种物资的运费比公路运价减少了二分之一到三分之二，运输时间缩短一半以上。这给西北人民带来了福利，生活逐步得到改善。西北贸易部门已有计划地把甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等省五十七种主要工业品的价格降低了百分之一点一到六点五。产地羊毛的价格也作了适当调整，青海省西宁市在天兰铁路通车前二十三斤羊毛换一匹白市布，现在二十一斤羊毛就可以换一匹布。青海、甘肃省名产的羊毛不再积压。甘草用火车装运运费比汽车运费降低了三分之二多，因此打开了销路。玉门的石油，由铁路转运后，使西安等地的油价降低。甘谷县不产煤，过去居民烧用的都是从四十公里外运来的木柴，现在廉价的煤由火车源源运到，烧煤比烧木柴可节省四分之三的费用，甘谷县居民已有百分之七十改用煤炉。广东的甘蔗、菠萝也由火车运到兰州。
    为了进一步活跃西北区的物资交流，改善西北各族人民的生活，西北正在新修很多公路，以配合铁路运输，更加活跃西北区的物资交流。现已经改建和新建完工的有兰州通往甘肃南部藏族地区最大的皮毛集散地——夏河等地五条公路；正在赶筑的有兰州通向甘肃岷县这个最大的药材集散地，以及从天水到皮毛集散地张家川等地的五条公路。
