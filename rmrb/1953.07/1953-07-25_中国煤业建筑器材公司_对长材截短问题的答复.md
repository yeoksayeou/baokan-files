    Reply to the Problem of Cutting Long Timber Short

    The China Coal Mine Construction Equipment Company writes: In the "Reader's Letters" column on June 17th, Comrade Xu Danyu of our Suzhou Company's letter was published, criticizing the Yueyang County and Nanchang City Coal Construction Companies for cutting 20-meter-long timber into approximately 11-meter lengths during timber allocation and transportation. According to the "Timber Specifications and Timber Measurement Methods" provisionally implemented uniformly nationwide by the Central Forestry Department in 1953, the standard specifications for various construction engineering timber are as follows: The length grade of general-purpose timber is 2 meters to 8 meters; the length grade of timber for hydraulic engineering and bridges (i.e., pile timber) is 11 meters to 13 meters for special pile timber, and 6 meters to 7 meters and 8 meters to 10 meters for ordinary pile timber; the length grade for shipbuilding timber is 8 meters to 10 meters. From the perspective of the standard specifications for timber use, the tip diameter of 20-meter-long timber is generally around 10 centimeters, while the root is generally over 30 centimeters, with a significant difference between the large and small ends. Cutting it into approximately 11-meter lengths does not affect its value in various engineering uses and should not be regarded as using large timber for small purposes. From a transportation perspective, if such long timber is not processed according to the national standard sizes, transportation waste would be significant, with transportation costs more than doubling compared to after being cut. From the perspective of local operations, such long timber has very few sales outlets. If it is transported to the sales area without altering its original length, it will inevitably lead to stockpiling. Currently, in general across the country, such long timber is stockpiled and no one is interested in it, and much of it has rotted and deteriorated due to long-term stockpiling. From a pricing perspective, the price of long timber should theoretically be higher than that of short timber, but in reality, users cannot use such long timber unless they cut it short. Therefore, the pricing issue of this kind of long timber is currently somewhat unreasonable, and we are studying revisions.

### 中国煤业建筑器材公司  对长材截短问题的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国煤业建筑器材公司
    对长材截短问题的答复
    中国煤业建筑器材公司来信：六月十七日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了我苏州市公司许淡云同志的来信，批评岳阳县和南昌市煤建公司调拨木材时把二十公尺的长材截成十一公尺左右运输的问题。根据中央林业部一九五三年度全国统一试行的“木材规格及木材检尺办法”，各种建筑工程用材标准规格是这样的：一般用材的长级为二公尺至八公尺；水利工程、桥梁（即桩木材）用材的长级特殊桩木为十一公尺至十三公尺，普通桩木长级为六公尺至七公尺和八公尺至十公尺；造船材长级为八公尺至十公尺。从用材标准规格上看，二十公尺的长材其梢径一般是十公分左右，根部一般则在三十公分以上，大小头相差悬殊；截成十一公尺左右后在各种工程的使用价值上并无影响，不应看成是大材小用。从运输上看，这样的长材如不按国家规定尺码制材，在运输上浪费是很大的，运费要比截成后加大一倍以上。从各地经营上看，这样的长材销路极少，如果原长不动运往销地，势必造成积压。目前全国一般情况，这样的长材积压无人问津，有许多已因长期积压而腐烂变质。从价格上看，长材比短材价格按理应当高，但事实上用户买去这样的长材后不截短仍是不能用；所以这种长材的价格问题，在目前来说是有某些不合理的，我们正在研究修正。
