Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 18th: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company has over-fulfilled the state plan for the first half of this year for nine major products. These products include pig iron, steel, medium-sized steel, thin steel plates, steel ropes, coke, rich ore, lean ore, and sintered ore. The over-fulfillment of the plan for these major products is of great significance for meeting the steel needs of economic construction throughout the country.

In the first half of the year, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant not only exceeded its planned pig iron production but also significantly improved its quality. The plant's actual cost in the first quarter of this year was also 10 billion yuan less than the state's planned cost. In the first half of the year, the Steel Plant over-fulfilled the state steel production plan by 1.6 percent, with the total output of high-quality steel of various specifications exceeding the plan by 1.16 percent. Compared with the same period last year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's pig iron production in the first half of this year increased by 26.6 percent, and steel production increased by 23.8 percent.

Some new equipment added by Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the first half of this year has played a huge role in production. Since being put into production in March this year, the No. 8 blast furnace of the Iron Smelting Plant has seen its output break through the standards stipulated by the design in a very short period of time, thanks to the rapid improvement of the technical level of the workers. The steelmaking open-hearth furnaces put into production at the end of last year and January of this year are also performing well, with the average smelting time per furnace reduced by 2.23 minutes compared to the original plan.

    鞍钢有九种主要产品超额完成上半年计划
    【新华社鞍山十八日电】鞍山钢铁公司有九种主要产品超额完成了今年上半年的国家计划。这些产品包括生铁、钢、中型钢材、薄钢板、钢绳、焦炭、富矿、贫矿和烧结矿等。这些主要产品能够超额完成计划，对于满足全国各地经济建设中的钢铁需要有着重大的意义。
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂上半年除生铁产量超过了原订计划外；质量也有显著提高。全厂今年第一季度的实际成本，也比国家的计划成本减少了一百亿元。炼钢厂上半年钢的产量超额百分之一点六完成国家计划，其中各种规格的优质钢的总产量，超额百分之一点一六完成了计划。鞍山钢铁公司今年上半年生铁和钢的产量，如和去年同期的产量相比，生铁提高了百分之二十六点六；钢提高了百分之二十三点八。
    鞍山钢铁公司今年上半年增添的一些新的设备，已在生产中发挥了巨大力量。炼铁厂八号炼铁炉自今年三月投入生产以来，由于职工们迅速提高了自己的技术水平，使它的产量在很短时期内突破了设计所规定的标准。炼钢厂去年年底和今年一月投入生产的炼钢平炉，生产情况也很好，每炉钢的平均冶炼时间比原计划减少了两点二十三分钟。
