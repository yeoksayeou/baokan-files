    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 5th: Tokyo dispatch: Three million Japanese workers launched large-scale struggles throughout the country on the 4th, using practical action to oppose the anti-strike law.
    According to the planned schedule, approximately three million members of more than 30 trade union units affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo") held timed strikes and mass protest rallies on the 4th to protest the reactionary measures of the Yoshida government in attempting to formulate an anti-strike law. Members of the Japan Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions, the trade union organization of Japanese public officials who were deprived of their right to strike by the Yoshida government, also participated in this struggle against the anti-strike law by refusing to work overtime. The "Sohyo's" second struggle using practical action to oppose the anti-strike law will take place on the 15th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 4th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese national railway workers and government officials are persisting in their struggle to demand the issuance of summer allowances.
    On June 29th, the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union established a new Central Struggle Committee and held the first collective bargaining session with the National Railway Authority, demanding the issuance of summer allowances. However, due to the government authorities' refusal of their demands, the negotiations broke down. Three hundred worker representatives held a sit-in protest in the National Railway Corporation office building on the same day. Local organizations of the union also conducted sit-in protests separately.
    On July 2nd, the National Railway Workers' Union and the authorities held another collective bargaining session, but the authorities still failed to fully and reasonably resolve the union's demands. Therefore, the National Railway Workers' Union decided to continue the struggle from 00:00 on the morning of the 3rd.
    The Japan Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions, a nationwide trade union organization for public school teachers, is also continuing to demand that the Yoshida government issue summer allowances equivalent to one month's salary and increase the base wage. In order to implement this demand, the union's struggle committee has initially decided to conduct a struggle of leaving work on time from the 7th to the 10th, and from the 13th to the 16th, to carry out struggles including leaving work early and taking leave.

    日本三百万工人用行动反对禁止罢工法
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：日本三百万工人于四日在全国各地展开了用实际行动反对禁止罢工法的大规模斗争。
    按照预定的计划，日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）所属的三十多个工会单位共约三百万会员在四日分别举行定时罢工和群众抗议大会，抗议吉田政府企图制订禁止罢工法的反动措施。被吉田政府剥夺了罢工权利的日本公职人员的工会组织——日本官公厅工会协议会的会员，也用拒绝做逾时工作的行动，参加了这次反对禁止罢工法的斗争。“总评”的第二次用实际行动反对禁止罢工法的斗争将在十五日进行。
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：日本国营铁道工人和政府机关工作人员，坚持进行要求发给夏季津贴的斗争。
    日本国营铁道工会在六月二十九日成立了新的中央斗争委员会，并和国营铁道当局举行第一次集体谈判，要求发给夏季津贴。但由于政府当局拒绝他们的要求，结果谈判决裂。三百名工人代表，当天在国营铁道公司办公大楼里举行了静坐斗争。工会的各地方组织同时也分别进行了静坐斗争。
    七月二日，国营铁道工会和当局再次举行集体谈判，可是当局对工会的要求仍然不予全盘的合理解决。因此，国营铁道工会决定从三日上午零时起，继续展开斗争。
    日本全国性的公教人员工会组织——日本官公厅工会协议会，也在继续向吉田政府要求发给相当于一个月工资的夏季津贴，并提高工资基数。为了贯彻这一要求，工会斗争委员会已初步决定，从七日到十日进行按时下班的斗争，十三日到十六日，进行包括提前下班和请假等方式在内的斗争。
