Xinhua News Agency, July 8th, New Delhi Dispatch: The Indian National Congress National Committee meeting was held in Agra on the 6th and 7th. National Congress Party Chairman Nehru delivered a speech at the meeting.

	In his opening remarks, Chairman Nehru condemned Syngman Rhee's policy of obstructing the realization of peace in Korea. Nehru said that Syngman Rhee's actions in Korea were "extremely unfortunate" and "obstructed world peace." Nehru said: "I still do not know whether India will be asked to complete its task, because just when everything had been resolved and everyone believed that peace would be achieved in a day or two, such a thing happened, making the realization of peace a question." Nehru said: The Korean issue is one of the most serious international issues, so a peaceful resolution of this issue will consolidate international peace. At the close of the meeting, Nehru said: "One thing is very clear, that is, Syngman Rhee's actions are very important to us, to the world, and to the United Nations. This has disgraced the United Nations and the countries that accepted the prisoner of war agreement. Just because one person is causing trouble, the whole thing is messed up, and this person is at ease, not even thinking about whether his actions will cause war or lead to peace."
	B. Pant, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, India, spoke at the meeting, fiercely criticizing Syngman Rhee's actions. He said: "We should firmly express our indignation at Syngman Rhee's actions because he is plotting to undermine the realization of peace. His actions have aroused the anger of all friends of peace." Pant continued: The Korean incident should prompt the United Nations to convene a general assembly to immediately study the new situation and formulate concrete measures aimed at controlling Syngman Rhee. Pant finally called on the major powers to hold a meeting to discuss and resolve all issues of disagreement.
	The meeting unanimously adopted the resolution on diplomatic issues without amendment. The resolution stated: The hope for peace in Korea cannot be realized due to the attitude adopted by Syngman Rhee and his government. "His actions have clearly violated the terms of the prisoner of war agreement, and he has put forward impossible demands for continuing the war or resuming the war after a certain period." The resolution also stated: It is hoped that the United Nations General Assembly will convene soon to discuss the serious situation in Korea and take appropriate measures to ensure that the agreed ceasefire conditions can take effect.

    在印度国民大会党全国委员会会议上
    尼赫鲁在演说中严厉谴责李承晚
    【新华社八日讯】新德里消息：印度国民大会党全国委员会会议于六七两日在亚格拉举行。国民大会党主席尼赫鲁在会议上发表了演说。
    尼赫鲁主席在会议开幕词中谴责李承晚阻挠实现朝鲜和平的政策。尼赫鲁说，李承晚在朝鲜的行动是“极其不幸的”，它“阻挠了全世界的和平”。尼赫鲁说：“我仍然不知道，印度是否会被要求完成它的任务，因为正在一切问题都已解决，大家都相信和平一两天就会实现的时候，竟发生了这样的事情，使得和平的实现成了疑问。”尼赫鲁说：朝鲜问题是最严重的国际问题之一，因此这个问题的和平解决，就会巩固国际和平。尼赫鲁在会议闭幕时又说：“有一件事很清楚，就是李承晚的这种行动对我们、对世界和对联合国来说是很重要的。这使得联合国和接受战俘协定的各国丢了脸，为了一个人从中捣蛋，就把整个事情弄糟了，而这个人却逍遥自在，毫不想想他的这种行动是会引起战争还是导致和平。”
    印度北方省首席部长比·潘特在会议上发言时，激烈地批评李承晚的行动。他说：“我们应当坚决地对李承晚的行动表示愤慨，因为他阴谋破坏和平的实现。他的行动引起了一切和平朋友的愤怒。”潘特继续说：朝鲜事件应当促使联合国召开大会，以便立即研究新的情势，拟出以控制李承晚为目的的具体措施，潘特最后呼吁大国召开会议来讨论和解决一切发生歧见的问题。
    会议一致不加修正地通过了关于外交问题的决议。决议中说：朝鲜的和平希望因为李承晚和他的政府所采取的态度而无法实现。“他的行动显然是破坏了战俘协议的条款，他并在提出继续战争或在一定期间后恢复战争的不可能实现的要求。”决议还说：希望联合国大会不久开会讨论严重的朝鲜形势，能采取适当措施使已经同意的停战条件能发生效力。
