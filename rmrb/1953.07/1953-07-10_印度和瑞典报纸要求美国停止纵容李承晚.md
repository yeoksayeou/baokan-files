Xinhua News Agency dispatch from New Delhi: The "Times of India" published a commentary on the 4th, demanding that the United States change its attitude of tolerating Syngman Rhee. The newspaper said that Syngman Rhee is biting the hand that feeds him. "If it were not for the support of the United States government, Syngman Rhee would probably have been abandoned by his own people long ago; now, the more the United States indulges him, the more determined he is to make things difficult for it and embarrass it... How much longer is the United States prepared to beg this despicable person to try to save the armistice he is determined to destroy?"
　　
Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Stockholm: The Swedish newspaper "Expressen" published an editorial on the 8th, demanding that the United States government stop tolerating Syngman Rhee. The newspaper said: "It is ridiculous to try to pass off this despicable villain as the representative of the Korean people." The newspaper said that for the United States, the Korean War "has become a festering wound that refuses to heal, exhausting and sickening the entire organism. Sooner or later, it will be necessary to eliminate the possibility of the South Korean ruler causing trouble, and no one in the United States can have any illusions about this anymore."

    印度和瑞典报纸要求美国停止纵容李承晚
    【新华社讯】新德里消息：“印度时报”四日发表评论，要求美国改变对李承晚的纵容态度。该报说，李承晚正在咬喂养他的人的手。“要是没有美国政府的支持，李承晚恐怕早已被他自己的人民所摒弃；现在美国越对他姑息，他就越发下定决心跟它为难，使它难堪……对于这个卑鄙的人，美国还预备用多久的时间去恳求他设法拯救他已决心破坏的停战呢？”
    【新华社讯】斯德哥尔摩消息：瑞典报纸“快报”在八日发表社论，要求美国政府停止纵容李承晚。报纸说：“硬要把这个卑鄙小人当作朝鲜人民的代表是令人可笑的。”报纸说，朝鲜战争对于美国说来，“已经成为一个染有恶性疾病的伤口，这个伤口拒绝治疗，使得整个组织疲惫和厌恶。迟早总有必要除去南朝鲜统治者闯祸的可能性，在美国再也没有人能够对此怀有任何幻想”。
