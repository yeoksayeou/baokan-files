    Should Stop Mass Capturing of "Field Frogs"
    Readers Shi Gu of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Tian Dehuai of the Shangyu County Health Center in Zhejiang Province, and Zhao Xizhu of the Central Textile Industry Department have written successively stating: There are many markets and restaurants in cities everywhere selling "field frogs" (i.e., frogs). We believe this phenomenon is detrimental to agricultural production. "Field frogs" are beneficial animals that prey on agricultural pests, and farmers in many areas call them "Guardian Generals of the Grain." Arbitrarily and massively capturing "field frogs" will directly affect the grain harvest. We hope that local people's governments will take appropriate measures to mobilize farmers to stop the phenomenon of mass capturing of field frogs.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应停止大量捕食“田鸡”
    天津市文学艺术界联合会石古、浙江省上虞县卫生院田德怀、中央纺织工业部赵熙珠等读者先后来信说：各地城市中菜市、饭馆售卖“田鸡”（即青蛙）的很多。我们认为这种现象对农业生产是不利的。“田鸡”是捕食农作物害虫的有益动物，不少地区的农民把它叫做“护谷将军”。任意地大量地捕食“田鸡”的做法，将会直接影响粮食的收获。希望各地人民政府采取适当的措施，动员农民停止大量捕食田鸡的现象。
