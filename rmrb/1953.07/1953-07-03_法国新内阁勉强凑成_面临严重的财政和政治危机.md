Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 1st dispatch: The new French Prime Minister, Joseph Laniel of the "Independent Republican Party," announced his list of cabinet members on the 28th. This new cabinet has 22 members, including the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, and Ministers of various departments, appointed by representatives of seven right-wing parties, including three representatives from the Gaullist party. Laniel's party colleague and close friend Paul Reynaud, as well as Henri Queuille of the "Radical Socialist Party" and Pierre Henri Teitgen of the "Popular Republican Movement," serve as Deputy Prime Ministers. Édouard Corniglion-Molinier of the Gaullist party serves as Minister of State; Edmond Barrachin, who split from the Gaullist party, and François Mitterrand of the "Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance" serve as newly established Ministers of State responsible for revising the constitution and European Commission affairs. Georges Bidault (Popular Republican Movement), the foreign minister of the Mayer government, René Pleven (Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance), the defense minister, and seven other ministers remain in their positions. The Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs is former Prime Minister Edgar Faure (Radical Socialist Party).

    The position of Minister for Relations with Associated States of Indochina is abolished, and a Secretary of State is established to handle related affairs, working directly under the Prime Minister's Office. Laniel's abolition of the position of Minister for Relations with Associated States of Indochina demonstrates the complete loss of confidence of the French ruling clique in the colonial war in Indochina. According to the Associated Press, Laniel had asked Reynaud to take on this "difficult position" when forming the cabinet, but Reynaud refused. Laniel then abolished the position.

    A notable change in the new government is the inclusion of Gaullists.

    Since 1946, this is the first time that people from de Gaulle's party have formally participated in the government, and the selection of a former Gaullist to be responsible for revising the constitution shows that the danger of Fascism is increasing.

    Although the new French cabinet has barely been formed, the bourgeois public opinion in France, Britain, and the United States has expressed a lack of confidence in the new cabinet's fate.

    Paris's "Combat" newspaper said that the new government will soon encounter serious difficulties: Indochina policy, repayment of advances to the Bank of France, and fixed wheat prices.

    The American United Press International listed the problems facing the new cabinet: a national debt reaching an unprecedented high of 5,072 billion francs; an empty treasury, which has borrowed another 50 billion francs from the Bank of France since the end of March; foreign exchange reserves low enough to cover only two months of the balance of payments to the European Payments Union, and gold reserves worth only 570 million US dollars; how to end the unpopular Indochina war; how to solve military expenditures; how to deal with the national independence movement in North Africa; and finally, the issue of the European Army plan. Therefore, UPI called Laniel's cabinet a "summer cabinet."

    The British Liberal Party's "Manchester Guardian" said: "The crisis does not seem to have changed the French political landscape much. ... As usual, how long Laniel's government will last and how firmly it can formulate and implement its policies remains an open question." The Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" said: "It would be too optimistic to think that a stable government has been seen."

### 法国新内阁勉强凑成  面临严重的财政和政治危机

    法国新内阁勉强凑成
    面临严重的财政和政治危机
    【新华社一日讯】巴黎消息：法国新总理、“独立共和党”人约瑟夫·拉尼埃在二十八日发表了他的内阁阁员名单。这个新内阁有总理、副总理及各部部长二十二人，由七个右翼政党的代表分任，内中有戴高乐党的三个代表。拉尼埃的同党和密友保罗·雷诺以及“激进社会党”的亨利·葛义、“人民共和党”的皮埃尔·亨利·戴尚出任副总理。戴高乐党的爱德华·高尼里昂—摩里尼埃任国务部长；从戴高乐党分裂出来的埃德蒙·巴拉辛和“民主社会抵抗联盟”的弗朗索瓦·密特朗分别担任新设的负责修改宪法和欧洲委员会事务的国务部长。迈耶政府的外交部长乔治·皮杜尔（人民共和党）、国防部长雷纳·普利文（民主社会抵抗联盟）和其他七个部长继续留任。财政经济部长由前总理埃加·富尔（激进社会党）担任。
    印度支那联邦成员国关系部长一职撤消，另设国务秘书处理有关事务，在总理办公室直接领导下进行工作。拉尼埃取消印度支那联邦成员国关系部长一职，说明法国统治集团对印度支那殖民战争完全丧失信心。据美联社透露，拉尼埃在组阁时曾经请雷诺担任这个“困难的职位”，但是雷诺拒绝了。拉尼埃后来就取消了这个职位。
    新政府的一个值得注意的变动是戴高乐分子的入阁。
    一九四六年以来，戴高乐的人这次第一次正式参加了政府，而且选了一个原戴高乐党人来负责修改宪法，这说明法西斯化的危险加强了。
    法国新阁虽然勉强凑成，法国、英国和美国的资产阶级舆论都对新阁的命运表示没有信心。
    巴黎“战斗报”说，新政府很快将遇到严重的困难：印度支那政策、付回法兰西银行的垫款和固定麦价。
    美国的合众社列举了摆在新阁面前的难题：国家债务达到五万零七十二亿多法郎的空前高额；国库空虚，自三月底以来，又向法兰西银行借了五百亿法郎；外汇储备低到只够付两个月对欧洲支付同盟的差额，黄金储备只合五亿七千多万美元；不得人心的印度支那战争如何结束；军费如何解决；北非的民族独立运动如何应付；最后，还有一个欧洲军计划问题。因此，合众社称拉尼埃的内阁为“暑假内阁”。
    英国自由党的“曼彻斯特卫报”说：“危机似乎不曾使法国政治外貌有多大改变。……和平常一样，拉尼埃的政府会存在多久，能怎样坚定地制订和执行它的政策：仍然是个公开的问题。”保守党的“每日电讯报”说：“以为已经看见一个稳定的政府，就未免太乐观了。”
