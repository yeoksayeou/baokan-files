Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 3rd. Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Syngman Rhee's actions and clamoring to sabotage the armistice have reached an extreme degree of frenzy. According to the Associated Press, in the letter Eisenhower sent with Robertson, the following four guarantees were made to Syngman Rhee:

	One, the United States and Syngman Rhee will enter into a mutual defense treaty.
	Two, the United States will provide Syngman Rhee with economic and military assistance.
	Three, the United States will take the same stance as Syngman Rhee at the political conference to be held after the armistice.
	Four, the United States will cooperate in Syngman Rhee's efforts to strive for the "peaceful unification" of Korea.

The news said that after receiving the four guarantees on June 27, Syngman Rhee told Robertson, "President Eisenhower has satisfied all my demands." However, the next day, Syngman Rhee made a new demand to Robertson, namely: if the political conference cannot achieve the unification of Korea as required by Syngman Rhee within ninety days, the United States should continue the war with Syngman Rhee to unify Korea by force. As of today, news from Seoul still says that Syngman Rhee has been insisting on this demand to sabotage the armistice and continue the war.

How the United States will respond to this demand is currently unknown. However, news from Washington says that senior officials of the U.S. State Department are painstakingly explaining to its increasingly impatient "friendly nations" that "there are many ways to persuade Syngman Rhee to accept the armistice"; although experience since Syngman Rhee "released" the prisoners of war has proven that Washington's so-called "persuasion" methods have not only failed to make Syngman Rhee accept the armistice, but have instead only made Syngman Rhee more brazen in sabotaging its realization.

Syngman Rhee apparently believes that if he resolutely wants to continue fighting, the United States' "persuasion" policy has no way to deal with him. The day before yesterday, through his Foreign Minister Byun Young-tae, he clamored that he "has become disheartened with the idea of solving the Korean issue by peaceful means." He believes that "apart from military means, there is no other way to unify Korea." Just as the United States is trying its best to make people believe that it is impossible to recover the "released" prisoners of war, Syngman Rhee has begun openly forcing detained North Korean prisoners of war to join the puppet army since yesterday. According to United Press, approximately one thousand prisoners of war were forced to join the puppet army in Busan yesterday, and more than three hundred today. These are all actions that openly violate Article 52 of the armistice agreement. At the same time, a spokesman for the U.S. POW camp headquarters announced that the headquarters was "powerless" to recover the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were forcibly detained by Syngman Rhee.

Not only that, but Syngman Rhee is now becoming increasingly domineering and has launched a fierce counterattack against those who have condemned him. In a written interview with a reporter from the London "Daily Herald," he attacked Churchill, who is currently ill, for "insulting" him. He also attacked India.

Moreover, Syngman Rhee does not express gratitude to his American masters, even though Clark has not done anything to trouble Syngman Rhee since saying that Syngman Rhee had broken his "promise" and expressing that he would "try his best" to recover the prisoners of war. In the aforementioned interview with the British newspaper reporter, Syngman Rhee also attacked Clark's "mistake" and accused Clark of not issuing a statement to correct the "mistake." However, American officials in Tokyo, Seoul, or Washington are all silent on this point.

Syngman Rhee's clamoring shows the extent to which he has become frenzied under American connivance. For Syngman Rhee, he can do whatever he wants, make trouble, and act recklessly. As one South Korean government official said when talking about Syngman Rhee's attitude, "He has nothing to lose anyway." He came to Korea from the United States as a pauper, and he is indifferent to the endless pain and suffering endured by tens of millions of Korean people in the war of aggression he launched. He will never shed half a tear for the mothers and wives of the 380,000 American youths who were killed or wounded in the three-year Korean War, and even less will he cry for the American taxpayers who have spent 200 billion U.S. dollars in the three-year Korean War.

### 美国给予李匪帮四项保证  李承晚破坏停战的行动更加猖狂

    美国给予李匪帮四项保证
    李承晚破坏停战的行动更加猖狂
    【新华社开城三日电】本社特派记者江南报道：李承晚破坏停战实现的行动和叫嚣已经到了极端猖狂的地步。美联社的消息说，罗伯逊带来的艾森豪威尔的信里，向李承晚提出了下列四点保证：
    一、美国和李承晚订立一个共同防御条约。
    二、美国给李承晚以经济和军事的援助。
    三、美国在停战以后召开的政治会议上和李承晚采取同一态度。
    四、美国在李承晚争取“和平统一”朝鲜的努力中予以合作。
    消息说，李承晚在六月二十七日得到四项保证以后对罗伯逊说：“艾森豪威尔总统已经满足了我所有的要求。”但是第二天，李承晚向罗伯逊又提出了一个新的要求，这就是：如果政治会议在九十天之内不能使朝鲜达到李承晚所要求的统一，美国就应该和李承晚一起继续进行战争以武力统一朝鲜。直到今天，来自汉城的消息仍说李承晚一直坚持这个破坏停战实现和继续进行战争的要求。
    美国怎样答复这个要求，人们现在还不知道。但是，从华盛顿来的消息说，美国国务院的高级官员们正在煞费苦心地向它的越来越不耐烦的“友邦”们说明，“说服李承晚接受停战的方法还很多”；虽然从李承晚“释放”战俘以来的经验已经证明：华盛顿的所谓“说服”办法，不但没有能够使李承晚接受停战，反而只是使李承晚更加蛮横地破坏停战的实现。
    李承晚显然认为，如果他坚决要继续打下去，美国的“说服”政策是拿他没有办法的。前天，他通过他的外务部长官卞荣泰叫嚣说，他“对于用和平方法来解决朝鲜问题这一点已经灰心了”。他认为
    “除了军事办法，没有其他办法可以使朝鲜统一”。正当美国方面竭力企图使人相信要追回被“释放”的战俘是不可能的时候，李承晚从昨天开始公开强迫被扣留的北朝鲜战俘加入伪军。据合众社报道说，在釜山被迫加入伪军的战俘昨天大约有一千名，今天又有三百多名。这些都是公开破坏停战协定第五十二款的行动。同时，美方战俘营司令部发言人宣布，这个司令部对于向李承晚追回被强迫扣留的中国人民志愿军被俘人员是“无能为力的”。
    不但如此，李承晚现在越来越跋扈，对那些谴责过他的人展开了激烈的反击。他在对伦敦“每日先驱报”记者发表的书面谈话中，攻击正在病中的邱吉尔“侮辱”他。他还攻击印度。
    而且，李承晚对他的美国主人并不表示感激，虽然克拉克自从说了李承晚背弃“诺言”并表示要“尽力”追回战俘的那些话以后，并没有做任何事情来麻烦李承晚。李承晚在上述的对英国报纸记者的谈话中也攻击克拉克的“错误”，并指责克拉克犯了“错误”后也没有声明更正。可是，不论东京汉城或华盛顿的美国官员，对这点都一声不响。
    李承晚的这些叫嚣，说明他在美国纵容之下，已经猖狂到何等地步。对于李承晚来说，他是可以胡作非为、捣乱蛮干的。正如南朝鲜政府的一个官员在谈到李承晚的态度时所说的，“他反正没有什么东西可以丢失了”，他从美国到朝鲜来的时候就是一条光棍，几千万朝鲜人民在他所发动的侵略战争中所遭受的无穷痛苦和灾难对于他是无动于衷的。他也绝不会为在三年朝鲜战争中伤亡了三十八万美国青年的母亲、妻子流半滴眼泪，更绝不会为在三年朝鲜战争中拿出了二百亿美元的美国纳税人喊冤枉的。
