From a District in Huanan County, Songjiang Province: How to Improve the Methods of District-Level Cadres Leading Agricultural Production
Ma Jian

“Treating production as the overriding central task”; “Unifying leadership thought, unifying work plans, and unifying the use of forces”; “Going deep among the masses, focusing on key points, and promoting the general.” These are all fundamental issues in the guiding ideology and methods of rural work. They may sound like old platitudes, but they are not easy to put into practice. According to our understanding of the situation in the First District of Huanan County in April this year, there are many problems in the work of district cadres leading production:

I. Although the district-level leadership has paid attention to unified leadership, unified planning, and unified use of forces in the past, these were often disrupted by the county-level departments. Each department emphasized the importance of its own work and required the district to "complete it within a time limit." The district had to cancel its original arrangements and plans and fell into a state of passive busyness. After the Spring Festival this year, when promoting new farming methods, the county's guiding ideology was relatively unified, the forces were more concentrated, and the instructions from higher authorities were more timely. More than 20 district-level cadres were often active in the countryside, so the district's leadership of production was relatively smooth. However, from the second half of March, the county's various departments had more business work, and district cadres were frequently transferred, leaving only seven or eight people active in the countryside. This greatly weakened the leadership of production work. The First District has a staffing of 25 cadres; except for one vacant agricultural assistant position, all other cadres have been assigned. However, four people are on leave for study (including the Provincial Party School, Administrative Cadre School, Armed Cadre School, and Cultural Remedial School), one person is leading migrant workers out of the area, one person is on long-term sick leave, and one person is taking turns for rest. In addition, the District People's Government has to keep two people working in the office; only 15 people are left to go to the countryside. These 15 people are frequently transferred by the county-level departments to attend meetings or work for extended periods. From March 8th to April 22nd, an average of two to three district cadres (from the District Party Secretary and District Head to assistants and clerks) were in the county every day attending meetings or working. Comrade Lang Yi, the District Party Secretary, said: "The district's work is just unable to stretch. We originally wanted to carry it out in a planned way, but it was disrupted by the county's various departments."

II. Although the district-level leading cadres also know that production is the overriding central task, many county-level departments' cadres directly contact the District Party Secretary after going to the countryside and demand that the District Party Committee be responsible for ensuring the completion of tasks. In addition, district cadres are often transferred by the county, so in actual work, it is difficult to put production in the "overriding" position. Some business departments simply emphasize their own business, often becoming disconnected from the central task; if the district leading cadres disagree, they will be criticized for "incomplete leadership." Some departments' cadres, after arriving in the district, do not go deep among the masses to understand the situation but sit in the District Party Committee office and ask the District Party Secretary to report on the situation.

In addition, because the division of labor among district-level leading cadres is not clear enough, the district, village, and various organizations, departments, and the broad masses of cadres and people have to find the District Party Secretary for everything. The District Tax Office also seeks help from the District Party Secretary when encountering difficulties in tax collection; the Transportation Company Business Office also asks the District Party Secretary to help find drivers for large trucks; rural people come to the District Party Secretary for some small matters, such as military families looking for housing, medical treatment, demobilized soldiers wanting to open tailor shops, and civil disputes, etc.; even a farmer in Hengdai Mountain Village whose mule foal was "stuck in the nest" asked the District Party Secretary to find a solution. If the District Party Secretary ignores the cadres from the upper levels who come to him, he will be criticized for the "District Party Committee not paying attention"; if he ignores the various affairs below, he is afraid that the masses will say he is "bureaucratic" and "arrogant." Therefore, he "attends to" all kinds of work from all sides, which weakens the leadership of current production work and Party affairs work.

III. Because of the passive and busy work, unable to deeply understand the situation and systematically solve problems, the District Party Committee's leadership of agricultural production work is difficult to break out of the old circle of "generalization." It has not done enough in grasping key points, going deep among the masses, discovering problems, creating experiences, and guiding the overall situation. For example, when sowing wheat, it was discovered that the masses were using very crude methods in cultivation. The District Party Committee only issued a circular to various villages and district cadres, asking everyone to pay attention; but it did not go deep among the masses to further help them come up with practical and feasible solutions to improve the methods and spread the experience in a timely manner. In this way, although some problems were discovered, it was as if they had not been discovered.

The district's leadership focus is also not clear, and the district cadres' forces are used in an average manner. Although key points have been set up and cadres have been assigned, the transfer of cadres by the county-level departments makes the key points lose their function.

IV. Most district cadres do not understand the production policies and lack agricultural production knowledge. For example, district cadre Huang Xiulan was working in Taipingzhuang Village, and the masses asked him, "If you sow millet with wide rows, what if the soil is pressed on the seedlings when you hoe them?" Huang could not answer and felt very embarrassed, so he had to say, "Let me go back and ask." Only one-third of the existing cadres in the district (including the District Party Secretary and District Head) know something about the Party's policies in agricultural production. Therefore, district cadres often avoid villages with agricultural production cooperatives when going to the countryside; even if they go to villages with agricultural production cooperatives, they are unwilling to go to the cooperatives, "fearing that the cooperatives will ask this and that." After going to the countryside, district cadres do not study documents and are trapped in the circle of affairs all day long, only seeking to complete the numbers assigned by the higher authorities; after they return to the district, the leadership rarely organizes them to study. They lack methods in their work, often make deviations in their work, are not respected by the masses, and feel distressed themselves.

How to solve this problem?

I. I believe that improving the leadership of the district is inseparable from the transformation of the county's leadership style. The unity of the county's leadership is the key to the district and village doing a good job in production. The County Party Committee and County Government should appropriately control the various business departments. The issuance of work and the transfer of cadres by the various business departments must be approved by the County Party Committee. The cadres of the various departments of the county should work in the countryside around and in conjunction with production work, go deep among the masses to understand the situation, and should not just reach out to the District Party Committee for materials (of course, the District Party Committee should also take the initiative to report on the situation). On the other hand, the general business work of the various departments of the county should not require the District Party Committee to guarantee everything and be responsible for everything.

II. The district should give full play to organizational forces, cooperate in division of labor, and establish and improve the responsibility system. District leading cadres should have a clear division of labor. The District Party Secretary, Deputy Secretary, District Head, and Deputy District Head of the First District are now divided as follows: The District Party Secretary, in addition to grasping the overall leadership, focuses on leading Party affairs work; the Deputy District Party Secretary focuses on leading agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement; the District Head, in addition to grasping the overall leadership of administration, focuses on leading agricultural production and appropriately divides the work with the Deputy District Party Secretary; the Deputy District Head is more responsible for some administrative affairs. For the work of the various business departments from the upper levels, except for the Party system, all administrative systems should generally be discussed with the District Head; the administrative affairs of the district and village should also be the responsibility of the District Government. In this way, the District Party Secretary can free up more energy to lead the central work and Party affairs work.

Based on the existing cadre forces and specific situation, the First District has divided the entire district into four areas and established four work groups, with two leaders in each group. The District Party Secretary, Deputy Secretary, District Head, and Deputy District Head serve as the leaders of each group respectively. The work groups adopt a method of both concentration and decentralization to use forces. When solving an important problem in the work, they concentrate on key villages and groups to learn from experience, and then go to general villages to spread the experience. The District Party Committee often holds meetings to check and report on work, and problems that cannot be solved are brought to the District Party Committee for research. The work group is also a study group, and work and study are unified under leadership. At present, it seems that this is more appropriate for improving the level of district cadres and doing a good job in overall work. What needs to be paid attention to is that in implementing this method, the leadership must boldly use cadres, give full play to everyone's work enthusiasm, and do all kinds of work well, so as to avoid the situation where only the District Party Secretary, District Head, and work group leaders are busy and the general cadres are passive.

The district leading cadres should also clearly recognize that it is not enough to rely solely on the strength of a few district cadres, but it is also necessary to give full play to the strength of various organizations. The ideological leadership of Party branches, propaganda networks, Communist Youth League branches, and various mass organizations should be strengthened so that they can give full play to their role.

III. District leading cadres should grasp the center, master the farming season, and strive for initiative. Before the arrival of each farming season, work plans should be made early, and propaganda and mobilization work and specific preparations should be done early. Otherwise, if you fall behind one step, you will fall behind every step.

After making ideological mobilization and making preparations, you should, according to the specific situation of the district, first do a good job in key points and gain experience in a timely manner. In this way, the leadership can be proactive and the work can be carried out smoothly. It should be noted that when doing key work, you should not and cannot wait until everything is perfect and there are no shortcomings before promoting it to various villages; instead, you should promptly promote it when you find that there is a successful experience, and when you find shortcomings, you should help improve it on the one hand and remind other villages and groups to pay attention on the other hand. This will more effectively help key villages and groups to continuously move forward and will also timely drive the general villages and groups.

IV. District cadres should conduct in-depth investigation and research. You can adopt the method of holding small forums to understand problems from the masses and touch the masses' real thoughts. After understanding the masses' thoughts, you can specifically help village cadres come up with solutions and put forward clear and specific tasks. After each work is carried out, it is necessary to promptly conduct in-depth inspections and timely discover and solve problems. When inspecting work, you should not simply look at achievements or numbers, but focus on inspecting work methods and helping to summarize, exchange, and promote experience.

V. Strengthen the policy leadership and business guidance for district cadres. First, strengthen the leadership of policy study for district cadres. When district cadres go to the countryside, the District Party Committee should prescribe certain study tasks; after district cadres return to the district, the District Party Committee should check their study notes, hold tests, and organize them for collective discussion. Second, improve the method of district cadres reporting work after returning to the district. When reporting, do not report general work situations, but focus on reporting the specific problems and new experiences encountered in the work below; do not just have everyone report, the District Party Secretary "summarize" and "arrange" and be done, but organize everyone to discuss these specific problems and exchange experiences. This allows everyone to use their brains, everyone to come up with solutions, which can not only continuously improve the cadres' policy level and leadership ability but also facilitate the solution of practical problems.

    从松江省桦南县一个区看怎样改进区级干部领导农业生产的方法
    马健
    “把生产作为压倒一切的中心工作”；“统一领导思想，统一工作计划，统一使用力量”；“深入群众，搞好重点，推动一般”，这些都是农村工作中领导思想和领导方法上的根本问题，说起来好像是老生常谈，实际做起来可不简单。根据今年四月间我们在桦南县第一区了解的情况来看，在区干部领导生产的工作中是有不少问题的：
    一、区级领导方面过去虽然也注意了统一领导、统一计划、统一使用力量，但是往往被县级各部门打乱。各部门都强调自己的业务工作重要，要区里“限期完成”，区里只好把自己原来的布署和计划取消，陷于被动忙乱状态。今年春节后，在推广新耕作方法时，县里领导思想比较统一，力量比较集中，上级的指示比较及时，区级干部经常有二十多名在乡下活动，因此，区里领导生产也就比较顺利。但从三月下半月以后，县的各部门业务工作多起来了，区干部经常被抽调，乡下只有七、八个人活动了。这样，就大大地减弱了对生产工作的领导。一区干部按编制是二十五人；除了还缺一名农业助理员以外，其余干部都已配齐。但是，有离职学习的四人（包括省党校、行政干部学校、武装干部学校、文化补习学校），领导民工外出的一人，请长期病假的一人，轮流休息的一人。另外，区人民政府还要留二人在机关工作；能下乡的只剩了十五人。这十五个人还经常被县级各部门抽调去开会或长期工作。从三月八日到四月二十二日，区干部（从区委书记、区长到助理员、文书）平均每天都有两人到三人在县里开会或工作。区委书记郎义同志说：“区里工作就是伸不开腰。本想有计划地去干，可是一下子就叫县里各部门给打乱了。”
    二、区级领导干部虽然也知道生产是压倒一切的中心任务；但县里很多部门的干部下乡后都直接找区委书记，并要求区委负责保证完成任务，加上区干部常被县里抽调，因此在实际工作中，很难把生产放在“压倒一切”的地位。有些业务部门单纯强调搞自己的业务，往往和中心工作脱节；区领导干部如果不同意，还会被批评为“领导不全面”。有些部门的干部到区以后，不深入群众了解情况，而坐在区委办公室叫区委书记给汇报情况。
    另外，由于区级领导干部分工不够明确，区、村各个组织、各个部门以及广大干部群众，事事都要找区委书记来办。区税务所收税工作中发生困难也找区委书记帮助；运输公司营业所找大车拉脚也找区委书记帮忙；农村群众为了一些小事，如军属找房子、治病，转业军人想开成衣铺，以及民事纠纷等等，都来找区委书记；横黛山村一个农民的骡马下驹“爬窝”了，也找区委书记给想办法。区委书记对上边来找的各部门干部不管，会受到“区委不重视”的批评；对下边的各种事务工作不管，又怕群众会说“官僚”、“架子大”；因此，对来自各方面的工作一一“应酬”，结果就削弱了对当前生产工作和党务工作的领导。
    三、由于工作被动忙乱，不能深入地了解情况、系统地解决问题，区委对农业生产工作的领导就很难跳出“一般化”的老圈子，对于掌握重点、深入群众、发现问题、创造经验、指导全面作得很不够。如在种麦时，曾发现了群众在耕作上使用着十分粗糙的方法，区委只是给各村、各区干部发个通报，要大家注意；却没有深入群众进一步帮助群众想出切实可行的改进办法，把经验及时地传播开去。这样，虽然发现了一些问题，但也等于没有发现。
    区的领导重点也不明确，区干部的力量有平均使用的现象。虽然也设了重点，干部分了工；可是县级各部门一抽调干部，就使重点失去了作用。
    四、大部分区干部不懂生产方针和政策，缺乏农业生产知识。如区干部黄秀兰在太平庄村工作，群众问他：“种谷子宽苗眼，趟上土把苗压死了怎办？”黄答不上来，自己感到很不好看，只好说：“等我回去问问再说。”全区现有干部中，仅有三分之一的人（包括区委书记、区长在内）对党在农业生产中的方针和政策还知道一些。因此，一般区干部下乡常常躲开有农业生产合作社的村子；即便到有农业生产合作社的村工作，他们也不愿到社里去，
    “怕社里问这个问那个的”。区干部下乡后，不学习文件，整天陷在事务圈子里，只求完成上级分配给的数字；他们回区以后，领导方面也很少组织他们学习。他们在工作中缺乏办法，做工作常发生偏差，也不受群众尊重，自己也感到苦恼。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？
    一、我认为，改进区的领导，是和县的领导作风的转变分不开的。县里领导的统一，是区村做好生产工作的关键。县委、县政府对于各个业务部门应适当地加以控制。各个业务部门下达工作、抽调干部，必须经县委批准。县里各个部门干部下乡工作，应围绕与结合生产工作，深入群众了解情况，不应只是伸手向区委要材料（当然区委也应主动地反映情况）。另方面，县各部门的一般业务工作，不应事事要区委保证，样样要区委负责。
    二、区里要充分发挥组织力量，分工合作，建立与健全责任制度。区领导干部应有明确的分工。第一区区委书记、副书记和区长、副区长现在是这样分工的：区委书记除掌握全面领导外，着重领导党务工作；区委副书记着重领导农业生产和互助合作运动；区长除掌握行政的全面领导外，着重领导农业生产，并与区委副书记适当分工；副区长多负责一些行政事务。对于来自上级的各个业务部门的工作，除党的系统的以外，凡行政系统的，一般应和区长研究；区村的行政事务，也应由区政府负责。这样，区委书记可抽出更多的力量去领导中心工作和党务工作。
    第一区根据现有的干部力量和具体情况，把全区划分成四个片，成立了四个工作组，每组设两个组长，区委书记、副书记、区长、副区长分别担任各组组长。每个片里有重点村、社、组。工作组采取又集中又分散的办法使用力量。要解决工作中的一个重要问题时，就集中到重点村、组吸取经验，然后分别到一般村去传播。区委经常开碰头会，检查、汇报工作，有解决不了的问题就提到区委会研究。工作组同时又是学习组，工作和学习统一领导。目前来看，这样做对于提高区干部的水平、做好全面工作是比较恰当的。要注意的是，在实行这个办法时，领导方面必须大胆放手使用干部，充分发挥大家的工作积极性，把各种工作做好，以免只是区委书记、区长和工作组长忙忙乱乱，一般干部消极被动。
    区的领导干部还应明确认识：仅仅依靠几个区干部的力量是很不够的，还必须发挥各个组织的力量，对党支部、宣传网、团支部以及各个群众组织应加强思想领导，使它们充分发挥作用。
    三、区领导干部要抓紧中心、掌握农时、争取主动。在每一个农事季节到来之前，都要及早做出工作计划，及早做好宣传动员工作和具体的准备工作。不然，一步赶不上，就会步步赶不上。
    在作了思想动员、做了准备工作以后，就应当根据本区的具体情况，先搞好重点，及时地取得经验。这样，领导就能主动，就能使工作顺利开展。应注意的是：做重点工作时，不应而且也不可能做到十全十美一点毛病也没有的时候才向各村推广；而应当在发现有一点成功经验的时候就及时推广，发现有缺点时也应一方面帮助改进，一方面提醒其它村、组注意。这样才能更有效地帮助重点村、组不断前进，也才能及时带动一般村、组。
    四、区干部应深入地调查研究。可采取召开小型座谈会的方式，从群众中了解问题，摸着群众的真实思想。在了解了群众思想以后，再具体帮助村干部想出办法，提出明确具体的任务。每一项工作开展以后，都要及时深入地检查，及时发现问题、解决问题。检查工作时不能单纯看成绩或数字，而应着重检查工作方法，并帮助总结、交流和推广经验。
    五、要加强对区干部的政策领导和业务指导。一是加强对区干部政策学习的领导。区干部下乡时，区委应给规定一定的学习任务；区干部回区后，区委应检查他们的学习笔记，举行测验，并组织他们集体讨论。二是改进区干部回区汇报工作的方法。汇报时不要泛泛地汇报一些工作情况，而要着重汇报下边工作中所碰到的具体问题和新的经验；不要大家一汇报、区委书记一“总结”一“布置”就完事，而要组织大家讨论这些具体问题，交流经验。这样使大家动脑筋，大家想办法，不但能不断地提高干部的政策水平和领导能力，而且便于解决实际问题。
