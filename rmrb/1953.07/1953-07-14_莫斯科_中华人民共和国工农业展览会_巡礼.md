Crowds of people streamed into Moscow's Central Culture and Recreation Park. People noticed that in just a few days, the shady area near the park entrance, along the Moscow River, had changed: three newly built houses had appeared, surrounded by freshly laid carpets of flowers and green grass, and the asphalt road had been completely renovated. Above the door of the central Chinese palace-style building hung the national emblem of the People's Republic of China, and the words "Exhibition of Industry and Agriculture of the People's Republic of China" were written in gold on the lintel. In front of the gate stood a plaster statue, created by Chinese artists, of Chinese workers and peasants jointly holding a large flag. On the afternoon of July 11th at 2 p.m., the opening ceremony of the exhibition was held in this linden-tree-lined place. After the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union, and the national flags of the two countries were raised on the flagpole, the long-awaited visit began. At 6 p.m., the public opening began, and crowds of visitors began to enter the exhibition hall.

To the right, on top of an exhibition hall, stood a pair of Chinese-style pavilions with golden roofs, green eaves, and red pillars. As people entered this exhibition hall, they were faced with a huge embroidered painting showing the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in the Kremlin. People read the unforgettable words written in gold on both sides in Russian:

"There is no doubt that the indestructible friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is now and will be in the future a guarantee for peace in the Far East, against all aggressors and warmongers." (Stalin)

"The friendship between the great peoples of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable because our friendship is based on the great internationalist principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin." (Mao Zedong)

From here on, the entire exhibition reflected the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

To the left of the entrance was the Sino-Soviet Friendship section. The center of the ground floor displayed: important diplomatic documents between China and the Soviet Union since the founding of the People's Republic of China, taken from "Pravda" and "People's Daily," a model of the Soviet Red Army Martyrs' Memorial Tower built to commemorate the Soviet army's liberation of Northeast China, and a model of the Sino-Soviet Joint Management of the Chinese Changchun Railway Memorial Tower built to commemorate the joint management of the Sino-Soviet Railway and the Soviet Union's uncompensated transfer of the railway to China. The surrounding walls were covered with various photographs reflecting the friendship between China and the Soviet Union in politics, economy, and culture. At the center of the staircase leading upstairs were large reliefs of Stalin and Mao Zedong. Upstairs were displayed the classic works of Lenin and Stalin, which guided and inspired the Chinese revolution, documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Chinese translations of Soviet scientific, literary, and artistic works that have had a significant impact on Chinese culture.

To the right of the entrance was the agriculture, forestry, and food section. Here, people could see China's rich agricultural products, reflecting the achievements of Chinese peasants in developing production after completing land reform and organizing themselves. On the front wall hung a three-dimensional map of Chinese products. On both sides of the ground floor were displayed six major grains – rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, millet, and soybeans – as well as various coarse grains and beans, cotton, ramie, silkworm cocoons, wool, bristles, egg products, casings, lacquer, bamboo, wood, and medicinal materials. In the center were placed famous local products: nine kinds of black tea, such as Keemun black tea, fifteen kinds of green tea, such as Longjing tea, five kinds of scented tea, such as jasmine tea, and brick tea and dark tea, such as Pu'er tea, as well as twenty-two kinds of oils, such as tung oil and peanut oil. There was also a model of a rosin factory in Northeast China designed with the help of Soviet experts. Also on display downstairs were various fruits and vegetables, sugar and canned goods, cigarettes and wine.

In the middle exhibition hall, after entering, people could see a bust of the great Stalin placed in the center, flanked by colored silk portraits of the leaders of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, Mao Zedong and Malenkov.

To the right was the resources, minerals, chemicals, transportation, and water conservancy section. Here were displayed China's rich coal, oil, iron, tungsten, antimony, tin, as well as asbestos, mica, sulfur, and other minerals, Chinese-produced pig iron, steel ingots, steel rails, alloy cutting tools, ductile iron, copper pipes, cement, glass, dyes, and chemical medicines. Here were models of the Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine and a chemical factory in Northeast China, as well as a national railway map and a model of the Erlang Mountain Highway in Xikang. Particularly noteworthy were the diagrams of five water conservancy projects: the Huai River project, the Runheji diversion sluice, the Sanhe sluice, the Jingjiang flood diversion, and the diversion of the Yellow River to benefit the Wei River. All three-dimensional diagrams of transportation and water conservancy were illuminated with electric lights. On the walls hung photographs of Chinese workers enthusiastically engaged in production and construction with the help of Soviet experts.

To the left was the machinery and electrical engineering section. In the center were displayed eleven types of machine tools made by factories across China, seven of which (including lathes, milling machines, planers, radial drilling machines, vertical lathes, etc.) were manufactured in 1953 under the guidance of Soviet experts and according to Soviet drawings. Here, Ma Minghe, a labor model from the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, demonstrated high-speed cutting methods. He absorbed the experience of Bushuyev, an advanced worker at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Plant, and was able to cut metal at a speed of 1,100 meters per minute. Also on display were electric analytical balances with an accuracy of one ten-thousandth of a centimeter, as well as ball bearings, grinding wheels, spinning machines, generators, transformers, vacuum tubes, bicycles, and so on.

In this exhibition hall, people saw the efforts made by the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, to move towards national industrialization, especially to develop heavy industry.

The hall on the left also had a Chinese-style gate. The national flags of China and the Soviet Union were also erected at the entrance. Downstairs, on one side, were displayed various silk, satin, damask, brocade, cotton, wool, and linen textiles; on the other side were displayed clothing. People paid close attention to the exquisite and beautiful silk fabrics – velvet, Ku satin, printed silk, Liuxiang crepe, brocade satin, Guxiang satin, cocoon silk, georgette velvet, etc. People also greatly appreciated Xiang embroidery, Su embroidery, Bies silk, drawnwork embroidery, lace, carpets, and Chinese clothing for men, women, and children, as well as its styles. There was also a model of the Harbin Flax Textile Factory, which was built with the help of Soviet experts. Upstairs, on one side, were displayed tires and rubber products, industrial belts and leather products, printing presses, paper, pens and other stationery, universal operating tables, X-ray machines, penicillin, sulfa drugs and other medical equipment and medicines, sewing machines and household appliances, etc. On the other side were displayed handicrafts reflecting the artistic level of the Chinese working people: porcelain, pottery, cloisonné enamel, lacquerware, carved lacquer, ivory carvings, jade carvings, bamboo carvings, wood carvings, etc. From these light industrial textiles and handicrafts, people saw the wisdom of the Chinese working people, and also saw that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, while leading the people to develop heavy industry, were concerned about satisfying the daily needs of the people.

After visiting the three halls, many people went to the Chinese restaurant attached to the exhibition. Here, they tasted Chinese dishes cooked by famous Chinese chefs, such as Peking duck.

The Soviet people and the Moscow newspapers attached great importance to the holding of the "Exhibition of Industry and Agriculture of the People's Republic of China." They unanimously believed that this was a manifestation of the achievements of the Chinese people in building a happy new life under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the Soviet people. This exhibition will help strengthen the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China.

    莫斯科“中华人民共和国工农业展览会”巡礼
    李何
    成群的人们，川流不息地来到莫斯科中央文化休息公园。人们发觉，在短短几天内，离公园进口不远，莫斯科河岸的林荫地方已经变了样子：三座新搭的房屋出现了，它们的周围新铺着鲜花绿草的地毯，柏油路完全翻新了。中间一座中国宫殿式房屋的大门顶，悬挂着中华人民共和国国徽，楣端用金字写着“中华人民共和国工农业展览会”。大门前立着一座由中国艺术家塑造的中国工人和农妇共举一面大旗的石膏像。七月十一日下午二时，就在这个菩提树环绕的地方，举行了展览会的开幕式。当乐队奏起中苏两国国歌，中苏两国国旗在旗杆上升起以后，人们盼望已久的参观就开始了。下午六时，群众的参观开始，成群成群的观众，开始走进了展览会会场。
    右边一个展览馆顶上耸立着一对金顶绿檐红柱的中国式亭子，人们走进这个展览馆，就面对着一幅巨大的毛绣的彩画，上面绣着中苏友好同盟互助条约在克里姆林宫签订的情形。人们念着两旁用俄文写成的永志人心的金字：
    “无庸置疑，苏联和中华人民共和国的不可摧毁的友谊，在现在和将来都是为着保证远东和平，反对一切侵略者及战争贩子的事业的。”（斯大林）
    “伟大的中苏两国人民的友谊之所以是牢不可破的，因为我们的友谊是根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的。”（毛泽东）
    从这里开始，整个展览会反映着中苏两国人民的伟大友谊。
    由进口往左走，是中苏友好部分。楼下正中陈列着：从“真理报”和“人民日报”拍摄下来的中华人民共和国成立以来中苏两国的重要外交文献，为纪念苏军解放中国东北而兴建的苏联红军烈士纪念塔模型，为纪念中苏共管中长铁路和苏联将铁路无偿地移交我国而修建的中苏共同管理中国长春铁路纪念塔模型。周围墙上挂满了各种照片，反映中苏两国在政治、经济、文化各方面的情谊。上楼的阶梯当中摆着斯大林、毛泽东的大浮雕。楼上陈列着指导和鼓舞中国革命的列宁、斯大林的经典著作，苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文献，以及对我国文化起着重大影响的苏联科学、文学、艺术著作的中译本。
    从进口往右是农林食品部分。人们在这里可以看到中国的丰富农产，它们反映着中国农民在完成土地改革和组织起来以后，在发展生产方面的成就。正面墙上挂着中国物产立体图。楼下两边陈列着六种主要粮食——大米、小麦、玉米、高粱、小米、大豆，以及各种杂粮和豆类、棉花、苎麻、蚕茧、毛羽、猪鬃、蛋品、肠衣、漆、竹、木和药材等。当中摆着各地名产：祁红等九种红茶、龙井等十五种绿茶、茉莉等五种花茶、普洱等砖茶和黑茶，以及桐油、花生油等二十二种油类。这里还摆着由苏联专家帮助设计的东北一个松香工厂的模型。楼下还陈列着各种水果和蔬菜、糖和罐头、烟和酒。
    在中间的一个展览馆里，人们进门后，就可以看到中央放着伟大的斯大林的半身塑像，两旁排着中苏两国人民领袖毛泽东和马林科夫的彩色丝织像。
    往右是资源、矿产、化工、交通和水利部分。这里陈列着中国丰富的煤、石油、铁、钨、锑、锡，以及石棉、云母、硫磺等矿产，中国自产的生铁、钢锭、钢轨、合金切削刀、球墨铸铁、铜管、水泥、玻璃、染料、化学药品等。这里摆着抚顺露天煤矿和东北一个化学工厂的模型，还摆着全国铁道图和西康二郎山公路模型。特别令人注目的是，治淮、润河集分水闸、三河闸、荆江分洪、引黄济卫等五个水利工程图。所有交通和水利的立体图都是用电灯来说明的。墙上挂着中国工人在苏联专家帮助下，热烈地进行生产和建设的照片。
    往左是机械电工部分。当中陈列着中国各地工厂自制的十一种工作母机，其中有七种（包括车床、铣床、刨床、摇臂钻床、立式车床等）是一九五三年在苏联专家指导下，依照苏联图样制成的。在这里有沈阳第二机械厂的劳动模范马鸣贺表演高速切削法。他吸收莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂先进工人布舒耶夫的经验，一分钟能切削金属一千一百公尺。这里还陈列着准确度可达万分之一公分的电示分析天平，以及球轴承、砂轮、纺纱机、发电机、变压器、真空管、脚踏车等等。
    人们在这个展览馆里看到了，由共产党领导的中国工人阶级，在苏联无私的帮助下，在为走向国家的工业化，首先是为发展重工业方面所作的努力。
    左边一个馆也是中国式的大门。门口也竖立着中苏两国国旗。楼下一边陈列着各种丝、绸、绫、缎、棉、毛、麻的纺织品；另一边陈列着服装。人们十分注意精致漂亮的丝织品——章绒、库缎、印花绸、留香绉、织锦缎、古香缎、茧绸、乔其纱绒等。人们也十分欣赏湘绣、苏绣、别丝、抽绣、花边、地毯以及中国男女儿童的服装和它的样式。这里也摆着在苏联专家帮助下建立的哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂的模型。楼上一边陈列着轮胎和橡胶制品、工业皮带和皮革制品、印刷机、纸张、钢笔和其他文具，万能手术床、X光机、青霉素、磺胺和其他医疗器械和药品，缝纫机和家庭用具等等。另一边陈列着表现中国劳动人民艺术水平的手工艺品：瓷器、陶器、景泰珐琅、漆器、雕漆、牙刻、玉刻、竹刻、木刻等等。人们从这些轻工业纺织品和手工业品中，看到了中国劳动人民的智慧，也看到中国共产党和人民政府在领导人民发展重工业的同时，关心满足人民的日常需要。
    参观了三个馆后，许多人们走进旁边由展览会附设的中国餐馆。在这里，他们尝着由中国名厨师烹调的中国菜，如像烤鸭之类。
    苏联人民和莫斯科各报都很重视“中华人民共和国工农业展览会”的举行。他们一致认为：这是中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在苏联人民帮助下，建立起幸福的新生活的成就的表现。这个展览会将有助于加强苏中两国人民的兄弟般的友谊。    （新华社）
