"Forty Years of Aspiration" is a play with industrial construction as its theme. It has been performed in Chongqing for more than a year, and this time it was also warmly welcomed by the audience in Beijing.

The playwrights realistically reflected the process of the Southwest First Steel Plant manufacturing steel rails for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The workers' selfless labor and their struggle against special agents and conservatism constitute a complex plot.

Watching this play can enhance people's confidence in the victory of the country's industrialization, and can also make workers more vigilant in safeguarding production safety. The play vividly demonstrates the great power of the working class, and the leading role of the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party. The play praises the advanced ideology and labor enthusiasm of the working class. Their wisdom and creativity, as the military representative in the play said, "cannot be calculated with numbers." Before liberation, the people of Southwest China looked forward to the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway for forty years, but they never even saw a shadow of it; after liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, the working class realized the forty-year dream of the people of Southwest China in two years. The authors chose this historically significant subject matter to demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the people's democratic system led by the working class. Under this huge theme, they depicted the struggle of advanced ideology overcoming conservative ideology, and also depicted the struggle of revolution overcoming counter-revolution, praising the heroic spirit of the working class in daring to overcome difficulties.

Another success of this work is that it describes the working class's proactive and responsible spirit, and portrays several positive characters who emerged from among the workers. The chairman of the trade union, Zhao Kunshan, and Master Liang, left a clear impression on people. They are two distinct characters. The authors portrayed these two workers not in a generalized or conceptualized way, but in a concrete way according to their different identities and personalities. The two old workers are relatives, but because of the different levels of awareness, their confidence in the people's cause is also different. Zhao Kunshan is a Communist Party member and the chairman of the workshop trade union. In him, the author created a vivid image of an advanced element of the working class. He has strong principles and remains calm in times of crisis; he knows how to lead everyone to overcome difficulties, and he is good at correctly implementing the Party's policy of uniting technical personnel; he shows the party spirit and the working-class spirit that a Communist Party member should have in everything he does. And what about Master Liang? He has neither the conservatism of Director Chen nor the proactiveness of the advanced workers. He sways between the two. But once he breaks through the original ideological boundaries, he moves forward in great strides. This kind of worker is very common among skilled masters.

The scene where Chairman Zhao and Master Liang talk while drinking is full of life. The thoughts and personalities of the two people are revealed particularly vividly in this dialogue.

Military Representative Li Guoliang is well described in some places. It is often not easy for young writers to realistically describe veteran cadres. Either the image is too rigid, or the words and deeds do not match the identity. The character of Li Guoliang in "Forty Years of Aspiration" can be said to have relatively avoided this problem.

In the first act, Representative Li and his wife, Wu Qing, have an important dialogue. They talked about the Party's decision to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and also mentioned the expectations of the people of Sichuan, and also talked about the difficulties of rolling steel rails, as well as Director Chen's conservative eight-year proposal. Although Representative Li was full of confidence, Wu Qing could not help but worry about him, and the readers could not help but worry about him, so their mood was not relaxed. Later, the couple suddenly turned to the daily life of the couple:

Wu: Little Bo came last week, you ignored her, and she went back and said to me: Dad can't roll out the steel rails and is so anxious that his eyebrows have become one.

Li: (Laughing) This little guy is really difficult to serve. Do you know what she wants to do? She wants me to take her to the river to catch crabs!

These two casual strokes added a lot of color to life. The affection between husband and wife and the willful behavior of children are as if they can be heard and seen, and the writing has its ups and downs.

This play is powerful in exposing the crimes of the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents. It can arouse the people's deep hatred for the special agents. When the despicable bombing plot was prevented by the workers in advance, and the special agents fell into the people's trap one by one, it fully revealed the unparalleled strength and power of the people's regime.

In terms of structure, the closer to the end, the more compact it becomes. By the fifth scene, the struggles against special agents and conservatism have yielded results, forming the necessary climax in the play.

The language of this play is relatively simple and concise, and there is also some humor in some places.

The above are the advantages of this play. Below, let's talk about the shortcomings.

The meaning of the title "Forty Years of Aspiration" should be the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, but this play only describes the process of the steel plant supplying steel rails for the railway. Although it is a common method for creators to reflect the entire garden in a drop of water, as far as this play is concerned, since the title is like this, it should show the long-term aspirations of the people of Sichuan in all aspects, as well as the convenience and joy of the people after the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is completed. The current appearance of the work makes people feel a bit of a problem with the title being inconsistent with the content.

Many workers appeared in the play, but none of them were written with the inner and outer characteristics formed by the type of work and its specific working environment. Even Zhao Chairman and Master Liang, who are written more prominently, we only know that they are steel workers, and the vividness of the image is somewhat limited.

The conservative Director Chen proposed an eight-year proposal for rolling steel rails, but the workers supported the leadership's opinion: steel rails can definitely be rolled out in two years. What is the basis for this? It is not explained in the play. This affects the solution of the contradiction between advanced thinking and conservative thinking, lacking sufficient persuasiveness.

The author gave the conservative Director Chen many opportunities to appear, but only described his impatience and saying strange things. The general characteristics of ordinary old engineers in the early days of liberation: despising the masses and being divorced from reality, but not highlighting these complex habits that they are still willing to study technically. This weakens the authenticity of this character to a certain extent. The image of Engineer Feng, who is in contrast to him, is written even more vaguely.

In terms of structure, there is a problem of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end. The first few scenes are a bit dull, and the development of events between the scenes seems to be unconnected.

However, despite these weaknesses, "Forty Years of Aspiration" is still a good play and is worth recommending to audiences all over the country.

The authors have created this play and revised it eleven times, and are still revising it now. This serious spirit is admirable. When this play was performed in Beijing, the director and actors had an unusually serious attitude. They used their artistic cultivation and experience to enhance the power of this drama with modern themes to attract the audience.

In the first year of our great Five-Year Plan, everyone felt happy after watching this play, and everyone also hopes that the authors of this play, as well as other playwrights, will have more and better creations to reflect the country's industrialization.

    歌颂了工人阶级的先进思想和创造力量
    ——话剧“四十年的愿望”观后
    周立波
    作剧：李庆升、赵锵、田广才、石玺、石曼
    导演：洪深演出者：中国青年艺术剧院
    “四十年的愿望”是以工业建设为主题的一个剧本，在重庆上演了一年有余，这次在北京公演，也得到了首都观众热烈的欢迎。
    剧作者们现实地反映了西南第一钢铁厂为成渝铁路制造钢轨的过程。工人的忘我劳动，和他们反特务，反保守的斗争，构成了错综复杂的情节。
    看了这个戏，能使人们增强对祖国工业化的胜利的信心，也能使工人在保卫生产安全方面提高警惕性。剧本生动地表现了工人阶级的伟大力量，表现了工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党的领导作用。剧本歌颂了工人阶级的先进思想和劳动热情。他们的智慧和创造力，正如剧中的军事代表所说，“不是能用数目字可以计算出来的”。解放前，西南人民盼望修筑成渝路，整整盼了四十年，连影子也没有见着；解放后，工人阶级在党和毛主席的正确领导之下，在苏联专家无私的帮助之下，两年之间，实现了西南人民四十年的梦想。作者选取了这个有历史意义的题材，表现了工人阶级所领导的人民民主制度的无比的优越性。在这个巨大的主题下，他们描写了先进思想克服保守思想的斗争，也描写了革命战胜反革命的斗争，表扬了工人阶级勇于克服困难的英雄气概。
    这个作品另外一个成功的地方，是它描写了工人阶级积极负责的精神，刻划了工人中间涌现出来的几个正面的人物。工会主席赵崑山和梁师父给人留下了明晰的印象，他们是两个个性分明的人物。作者刻划这两个工人，不是一般化的，也不是概念化的，而是按照不同的身份，不同的个性，作了具体的描写。两位老工人是亲家，但是因为觉悟程度的不同，对人民事业的信心也就不一样。赵崑山是个共产党员，车间工会主席，在他的身上，作者创造了一个工人阶级先进分子的鲜明的形象。他原则性强，临危不乱；他懂得怎样带动大家克服困难，他善于正确地执行党团结技术人员的政策；他处处表现一个共产党员应有的党性修养和工人阶级的气魄。而梁师父呢？他既没有陈主任的保守，也没有先进工人的积极。他摇摆在两者之间。但一经突破原有的思想界限，就大步向前。这种工人，在有技术的老师父里边是很普遍的。
    赵主席和梁师父一边喝酒，一边谈话的那一段戏是有生活色彩的，两个人的思想和个性，在这篇对话里显露得分外鲜明。
    军事代表李国亮，某些地方，描写得还好。年青的作家描写老干部，往往不容易逼真，不是形象过于呆板，就是言行不合身份。“四十年的愿望”里的李国亮的戏，可以说是比较地避免了这种毛病。
    第一幕里，李代表和他爱人吴青，有一段重要的对话。他们谈到了党关于修筑成渝铁路的决定，又提到了四川人民的盼望，也谈起了压轧钢轨的困难，以及陈主任的保守的八年建议，李代表虽然充满了信心，吴青不能不替他担心，读者也不能不为他焦虑，因而心情也并不轻松。两口子谈到后来，忽然转到了夫妇间的日常生活的闲话：
    吴：上星期小波来，你不理她，他回去跟我说：爸爸压不出钢轨来，急得眉毛都成了一根了。
    李：（笑）这个小家伙真难伺候，你知道她要干什么？她要我带她到河边上去摸螃蟹！
    闲闲的两笔，增加了生活的许多色泽，夫妻之间的情趣和小孩子的任性的行为都如闻如见，行文也就有个起伏了。
    这个戏，在暴露美蒋特务的罪行上是有力量的。能引起人民对于特务的切齿痛恨。当卑劣的爆炸阴谋被工人事先防止，特务分子一一落入人民的法网时，它充分地显露了人民政权的无比的坚强和威力。
    在结构上，是越到后面，就越紧凑。到第五场，反特务和反保守的斗争都有了结果，形成了戏里必要的高潮。
    这个戏在语言上是比较朴素简练的，有些地方也还有风趣。
    以上是这个剧本的优点，以下，我们来谈谈缺点。
    “四十年的愿望”这个题目的含义应该是整个成渝路，但本剧只描写了钢铁厂为该路供应钢轨的过程。在一滴水珠里来反映整个的花园虽是创作家们常用的方法，但就本剧来说，题目既然是这样，就应该在各方面表现四川人民的多年的愿望，以及成渝路修成以后的人民称便和欢乐的情景。作品目前的样子，就使人感到有点文不切题的毛病。
    戏里出现了许多的工人，但没有一个工人被写出了工种及其特定的工作环境所形成的内心和外貌的特征。就连写得较为突出的赵主席和梁师傅，我们也只知道他们是钢铁工人，形象的鲜明性就受到一定的限制。
    保守的陈主任提出了轧钢轨的八年建议，工人却支持领导上的意见：两年一定能轧出钢轨，到底有什么根据呢？戏里边也没有交代。这样就影响先进思想战胜保守思想这一矛盾的解决，缺乏充分的说服力。
    作者使保守的陈主任有许多出场的机会，但只描写了他的不耐烦，说怪话等等，在解放初期，一般旧工程师的普遍的特点：轻视群众，脱离实际，但在技术上还肯钻研的这些复杂的习性，却没有突出地表现出来。这样就在一定程度上减弱了这个人物的真实性。和他相对照的冯工程师的形象，却写得更模糊了。
    在结构方面，有前松后紧的毛病，前面几场，有点沉闷，场与场之间，事件的发展有些不相连贯的样子。
    但是，虽说有这些弱点，“四十年的愿望”还是不失为好戏，值得推荐给全国各地的观众。
    作者们创作这个戏，前前后后，已经修改十一次，直到现在，还在改动，这种认真的精神是令人佩服的。本剧在北京演出时，导演和演员，工作态度都异常严肃，他们用他们在艺术上的修养和经验，增强了这出现代题材的戏剧吸引观众的力量。
    在我们的伟大的五年计划的头一年，大家看了这个戏，都感到愉快，大家也希望本剧作者们，以及其他的剧作者们，都有更多更好的创作，来反映祖国的工业化。
