    Zhangjiakou Joint Transportation Branch Company, First Station:
    Guarantees to Conscientiously Implement Transportation Plans in the Future
    Letter from the Zhangjiakou Joint Transportation Branch Company, First Station: We sincerely accept the letter from a reader published on May 15th criticizing our station for not conscientiously implementing the first quarter railway transportation plan. In the past, the railway side allocated many extra freight cars to us in order to accommodate the cargo owners. We instead felt that making monthly car plans was unnecessary, so we didn't pay attention to them. We blindly engaged in business detached from the plan and arbitrarily disrupted the transportation plan. This was very wrong. We guarantee that we will resolutely correct the error of "loading whenever there are cars" just to save trouble, and conscientiously formulate and effectively implement the transportation plan in the future.

    张家口联运分公司第一站
    保证今后认真执行运输计划
    张家口联运分公司第一站来信：五月十五日报上刊载了读者批评我站不认真执行第一季度铁路运输计划的来信，我们诚恳接受。铁路方面过去为了照顾货主，拨给我们不少计划以外的车皮。我们反而感觉作车月计划是多此一举，就不加重视，脱离计划盲目搞业务，任意打乱运输计划。这是十分错误的。我们保证今后坚决改正“有车就装”只图省事的错误，认真编制并切实执行运输计划。
