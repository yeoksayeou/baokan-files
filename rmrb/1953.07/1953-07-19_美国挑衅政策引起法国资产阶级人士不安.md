Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 18th: The "Pravda" published an article by G. Razhdianni on the 14th, pointing out that the United States' provocative policies have caused unease among some members of the Parisian bourgeoisie.

Razhdianni wrote: The differences at the Washington Foreign Ministers' Conference reflect the opinions recently expressed by certain influential figures in Western Europe, especially in France, who believe that the United States' foreign policy may suffer a complete failure because it does not proceed from "actual circumstances."

The shameful failure of the United States' adventurous actions in Berlin has even awakened right-wing figures in France.

Razhdianni quoted a very telling article published in the Paris newspaper "Le Monde" – Paul Grado's "The Berlin Events and the Planned European Army." In this article, Grado asked: If the "European Defense Community" had already been established, that is, if the revanchist West German army already existed, what impact would the Berlin provocation on June 17th have had? Grado answered this question by saying: It is very likely that the Berlin provocation would "immediately turn into a Third World War, and the first to be dragged into this war would be the French." Grado warned against the US-organized "European Defense Community" plan in the conclusion of his article. He wrote: "The dangers contained in the 'European Defense Community' treaty have been specifically demonstrated in recent events. Therefore, we can conclude that the draft of this agreement is full of the danger of a new war. If this treaty is ratified, then we are taking risks, and one day we will be thrown into war 'for the benefit of the Prussian Emperor'. Of course, the French people will refuse to participate in such a war."

Razhdianni pointed out: Whether Washington likes it or not, the fact is that in Western Europe, where the demand for easing international tensions is growing stronger, more and more figures in the bourgeois ruling class believe that it is simply too dangerous to link their political fate with the current direction of US foreign policy.

    美国挑衅政策引起法国资产阶级人士不安
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十四日刊载了格·拉吉安尼所写的一篇文章，指出美国的挑衅政策引起了某些巴黎资产阶级人士的不安。
    拉吉安尼写道：华盛顿三国外长会议上的分歧反映出西欧，特别是法国某些有势力人士最近所表明的意见，这种意见认为，美国的外交政策可能遭到彻底的失败，因为它不是从“实际情况”出发的。
    美国在柏林的冒险行动的可耻失败甚至使法国的右翼人士也惊醒了过来。
    拉吉安尼引述了巴黎“世界报”所刊载的一篇很足说明问题的文章——保罗·格拉多特所写的“柏林事件与计划中的欧洲军”。格拉多特在这篇文章中问道：假使“欧洲防务集团”已经建立好了，也就是假使报复主义的西德军队已经存在的话，六月十七日柏林挑衅事件可能产生甚么影响呢？格拉多特答复这个问题说：很可能柏林挑衅事件会“立刻变成第三次世界大战，第一个被拖入这次战争中去的将是法国人。”格拉多特在他文章的结语部分警告美国组织“欧洲防务集团”的计划。他写道：“‘欧洲防务集团’条约所包含的危险性，已在最近的事件中具体表现出来。因此我们可以断定，这个协定的草案充满了新战争的危险。假使批准这个条约的话，那么我们就是自甘冒险，终于有一天会为了‘普鲁士皇帝的利益’而投入战争里去。当然，法国人民是会拒绝参加这种战争的。”
    拉吉安尼指出：不管华盛顿是否愿意，事实是：在主张缓和国际紧张局势的要求日益强烈的西欧，有越来越多的资产阶级统治集团人物都认为，假使把它们的政治命运和目前美国外交政策方针连在一起的话，简直太危险了。
