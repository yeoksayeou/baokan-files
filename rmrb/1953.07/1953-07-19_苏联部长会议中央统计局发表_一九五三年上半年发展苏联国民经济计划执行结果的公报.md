However, in some areas, the people's demand for certain goods has not been fully met.

While the sales volume of agricultural products in state-owned stores and cooperatives increased, the sales volume of agricultural products in collective farm markets also increased in the first half of 1953, especially the sales volume of flour, grain, eggs, potatoes, vegetables, poultry, and honey. In the first half of 1953, prices in collective farm markets decreased.

VII. Increase in the Number of Employees and Improvement of Labor Productivity

At the end of the first half of 1953, the number of employees in various sectors of the Soviet national economy increased by 1.15 million compared with the end of the first half of 1952. The number of employees in industry, agriculture, construction, and transportation increased by 1.03 million, and the number of employees in education, scientific research, and medical institutions increased by 120,000. As in previous years, there were no unemployed people in the Soviet Union in 1953. In the first half of 1953, more than 100,000 young workers graduated from vocational schools or mining schools to become skilled workers and have joined the work in industry, construction, and transportation sectors. In the first half of 1953, the labor productivity of industrial workers increased by 5 percent compared with the first half of 1952.

VIII. Cultural Development and Public Health

This year, the number of students graduating from urban and rural seven-year schools, secondary schools, and night schools increased by 18 percent compared with last year, of which the number of secondary school graduates increased by 37 percent.

This year, more than 500,000 young professionals graduated from higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools, including graduates from correspondence schools.

In the first half of 1953, the number of books published increased by 20 percent compared with the first half of 1952, and the number of textbooks published for primary schools, seven-year schools, and secondary schools increased by 58 percent.

In the first half of 1953, the medical services for residents continued to be improved and expanded. Everyone knows that in the Soviet Union, this medical service is free. General hospitals, maternity hospitals, sanatoriums, and rest homes have increased and have better medical and diagnostic equipment. In the first half of 1953, the production of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and appliances increased by 14 percent compared with the first half of last year.

In the first half of this year, approximately 20 million people spent paid vacations, which all employees can enjoy every year.

The development of the national economy and culture in the first half of 1953, as well as the results of the implementation of the 1951 and 1952 plans, prove that the tasks stipulated in the instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party on the development of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) are being successfully completed.

    在一九五三年上半年，工业生产成本约减低了百分之四。
    三、农业
    集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场胜利地完成了春季播种工作，完成了播种春季作物的计划。
    一九五三年的农作物的播种面积比去年扩大了。小麦——最宝贵的谷物——的播种面积大大增加了。甜菜、榨油作物的播种面积增加了。多年生牧草、一年生牧草、根类饲料和保藏饲料作物的播种面积扩大了。规定的种植亚麻和马铃薯的目标没有达到。
    今年，机器拖拉机站、国营农场、集体农庄开始用比一九五二年更好的机器与设备收割作物。到一九五三年七月一日，谷物收割联合机的数目比去年同一天增加了百分之十，其中自动推动联合机增加了百分之三十三。拖拉机曳引和自动推动干草刈割机的数目增加了百分之四十二。
    此外，农业方面得到了大批用马匹曳引的干草刈割机，收割机和其他收割机器。同一时期内，农业运货汽车的数目增加了百分之六。
    一九五三年七月一日，集体农庄牲畜的头数比去年同一天要多得多。其中牛增加了百分之四，猪百分之七，羊百分之十一，马百分之四。集体农庄家禽的数目增加了百分之十二。但是，集体农庄牲畜和家禽的增加还没有达到规定的速度。同一时期，国营农场牲畜头数增加的情况如下，牛百分之八，猪百分之六，羊百分之十二，马百分之七。国营农场家禽的数目增加了百分之十五。
    四、铁路和水路运输的发展

    六、商品流通的扩大
    一九五三年上半年苏联的贸易继续扩大。由于在工业和农业生产、提高劳动生产率以及降低产品成本方面取得了新的成绩，从一九五三年四月一日起，政府又实行了自废除配给制以来的第六次减低食品和制成品的国家零售价格。这一次的减低物价使得苏联卢布更加稳固了，它的购买力提高了，消费品的销售量进一步增加了。
    一九五三年，政府规定了额外的任务，要生产和销售给人民价值达二百多亿卢布的日用品。
    一九五三年上半年国营商店和合作社售给人民的货物数量，比一九五二年上半年增加了百分之十五。而在一九五三年第二季，由于物价的减低，日用品生产的增加，以及政府采取了其他增加零售货物的措施，售给人民的食品和制成品，比一九五二年第二季增加了百分之二十三。一九五三年上半年各种食品的销售量比一九五二年上半年增加的情形如下：肉类和肉类产品百分之三十、鱼类和鱼产品百分之二、牛油百分之二十六、植物油和其他食用油百分之十四、乳酪百分之二十三、蛋类百分之十八、糖百分之二十五、糖果百分之十八、茶百分之十八。
    销售量增加最多的制成品如下：棉织物百分之十四、毛织物百分之三十四、服装百分之二十九、针织品百分之二十四、袜子百分之二十七、皮鞋百分之二十四、钟表百分之二十八、缝纫机百分之三十二、家具百分之三十四、真空除尘器百分之三十二、留声机百分之二十二、电视机百分之二百。销售给人民的轻便汽车比一九五二年上半年增加了百分之七十二、机器脚踏车百分之三十三、脚踏车百分之十三。然而，在某些地区，人民对于某些货品的需求还没得到充分的满足。
    与国营商店和合作社的农产品销售量增加同时，一九五三年上半年集体农庄市场上农产品的销售量也增加了，特别是面粉、谷物、蛋类、马铃薯、蔬菜、家禽、蜂蜜的销售量。一九五三年上半年集体农庄市场上的价格降低了。
    七、职工人数的增加和劳动
        生产率的提高
    一九五三年上半年结束时，苏联国民经济各部门的职工人数比一九五二年上半年结束时增加了一百一十五万人。工业、农业、建筑和运输部门的职工人数增加了一百零三万人，教育、科学研究和医疗机关增加了十二万人。一九五三年和以往一样，苏联没有失业者。一九五三年上半年有十多万青年工人从职业学校或采矿学校毕业成为熟练工人，并已参加工业、建筑和运输部门中的工作。一九五三年上半年产业工人的劳动生产率比一九五二年上半年提高了百分之五。
    八、文化发展和公共卫生
    今年，从城市和乡村七年制学校、中等学校和夜校毕业的学生的人数，比去年增加了百分之十八，其中中学毕业生增加了百分之三十七。
    今年，从高等教育机关和中等专科学校毕业的青年专门人材，包括函授学校的毕业生在内，达五十多万名。
    在一九五三年上半年，书籍出版量比一九五二年上半年增加了百分之二十，初级学校、七年制学校和中等学校教科书的出版量增加了百分之五十八。
    一九五三年上半年继续改进并扩大对居民的医疗服务。大家都知道，在苏联，这种医疗服务是免费的。普通医院、产妇院、疗养院和休养所增加了，并且有了更好的医疗和诊断器械。在一九五三年上半年，药剂、医疗设备和用具的生产量，比去年上半年增加了百分之十四。
    在今年上半年，约有二千万人度过了工资照付的假期，这种假期是一切职工每年都能享受的。
    一九五三年上半年的国民经济和文化的发展，以及一九五一年和一九五二年计划执行的结果，证明共产党第十九次代表大会关于苏联发展第五个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的指示所规定的任务，正在胜利地完成。
