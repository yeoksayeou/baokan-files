Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 21st: During the fierce counterattack in the central Korean front in mid-July, our army's transportation troops continuously transported large quantities of food and ammunition to the front lines, effectively guaranteeing the material supply of the frontline combat troops. In the past few days, the frightened enemy dispatched hundreds of bomber and fighter sorties every day to bomb and strafe the Kimhwa area, attempting to cut off our army's transportation line from the rear to the Kimhwa front, so that our counterattacking troops would not receive sufficient ammunition and food. However, the enemy's attempt completely failed under the heavy blows of our army. During the day, when enemy planes hovered in the sky, our army's anti-aircraft fire immediately surrounded them, hitting them so that they fled in all directions or crashed down. At this time, our army's heroic truck drivers, with bare arms and sweating profusely, drove bravely and carefully on the roads in the mountains. At night, the firelight of exploding bombs occasionally illuminated the undulating mountains, and the air flashed with bursts of anti-aircraft shells. At this time, a large number of our army's transport vehicles sped along the winding roads in the valleys towards the front lines, and strings of yellow and white car lights flickered in the valleys. Our army's horse-drawn carts, camouflaged like clusters of green trees, moved non-stop with the cars. Sometimes they waited by the dusty road, letting the cars loaded with ammunition and food pass first. The soldiers sitting on the horse-drawn carts cheerfully cheered the cars, and then raised their whips and continued to urge their horses forward. In the first two days of the counterattack, there were continuous heavy rains on the front lines, and the roads were extremely muddy, and some bridges were washed away by the flood. The soldiers of our army's engineering units hammered piles and built bridges in the raging waves as deep as their necks, and used stones to fill the roads washed away by the floods, striving to ensure the smooth passage of transport vehicles. With the joint efforts of our army's anti-aircraft artillery, engineers, and various transportation troops, a large amount of our army's combat materials continuously followed the combat troops forward. In the new positions occupied by our army in the counterattack, large quantities of food and ammunition have been cleverly stored. These abundant materials have enabled our army's combat troops to effectively consolidate their new positions and kill and wound a large number of enemies who came to counterattack.

    在高射炮兵、工兵和运输部队共同努力下
    朝鲜中线我军作战部队粮弹充足
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】在七月中旬，朝鲜中线的强大反击战中，我军运输部队源源不断地把大批粮弹物资运上前线，有力地保证了前线作战部队的物资供应。这几天内，吓昏了的敌人每天都出动数百架次的轰炸机、战斗机向金城地区进行轰炸和扫射，企图切断我军从后方到金城前线的运输线，使我军反击部队得不到充足的弹药和粮食供应。但是，敌人的这一企图在我军的沉重打击下，完全失败了。白天，当敌机在天空中盘旋的时候，我军高射炮火就立即包围了它们，打得它们东逃西窜或坠落下来。这时，我军英勇的汽车司机们便光着臂膀、流着大汗，勇猛而细心地在群山中的道路上急驶起来。夜里，炸弹爆炸的火光不时照亮了起伏的山峦，空中闪着一蓬蓬的高射炮弹的火星。这时，我军大量的运输汽车沿着山谷中曲折的道路向前线急驶，山谷中闪烁着一串串黄白色的汽车灯光。伪装得像一丛丛绿树的我军马车队川流不息地和汽车一起前进，有时他们等在尘土飞扬的公路旁，让满载弹药和粮食的汽车先通过去。坐在马车上的战士们快乐地向着汽车欢呼，他们然后扬起鞭子，继续策马前进。在反击开始的头两天，前线连日大雨，道路泥泞不堪，有些桥梁被大水冲垮了。我军工兵部队的战士们便在深及头颈的汹涌江涛中打桩架桥，用石头填补被洪水冲塌的道路，努力保证着运输车辆的顺利通行。在我军高射炮兵、工兵、和各种运输部队的共同努力下，我军大量的战斗物资源源不断地紧跟着作战部队前进。在我军反击战中攻占的新阵地上，大量的粮食和弹药已巧妙地储藏起来。这些丰富的物资使我军作战部队有力地巩固了新阵地，并大量杀伤着前来反扑的敌人。
