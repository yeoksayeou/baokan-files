Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd - During the heroic anti-aircraft combat in the first half of June, the anti-aircraft machine gunners and infantry soldiers of the Korean People's Army defending the Yuefei Mountain position on the Eastern Front shot down and damaged 18 enemy planes. According to the Korean Central News Agency, there was fierce fighting in the Yuefei Mountain area in mid-June due to an enemy offensive. The enemy sent fighter groups from aircraft carriers to cover the attack, but suffered heavy blows.

　　On June 13, the enemy planes first carried out frantic bombing of the 351 Heights, which had been captured by the Korean People's Army. The anti-aircraft machine gunners and infantry soldiers of the Korean People's Army on the Yuefei Mountain position, together with the infantry units, countered the invading enemy planes with fierce firepower, and shot down seven enemy planes in succession. On this day, anti-aircraft machine gunner Zheng Changwu shot down two enemy planes by himself.

　　On June 15, the enemy began to attack 351 Heights, 200 Heights, and Sniper Heights, and dispatched 450 sorties of enemy aircraft to cover them. However, under the powerful and accurate firepower of the People's Army, the enemy planes dared not easily invade the airspace of the People's Army's positions, and dropped thousands of bombs in residential areas and farmland far away from the positions. On this day, the People's Army shot down and wounded seven enemy planes that ventured near the positions.

　　Prior to this, the anti-aircraft machine gunners on the Yuefei Mountain position had shot down four invading enemy planes in three days, on June 2, 3 and 5.

    在防守东线月飞山阵地对空作战中
    朝鲜人民军半月打落打伤敌机十八架
    【新华社平壤二日电】防守东线月飞山阵地的朝鲜人民军高射机枪手和步兵战士们，在六月上半月的英勇对空作战中，打落和打伤敌机十八架。据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，六月中旬，月飞山一带由于敌军发动进攻，曾有激战。敌军曾出动航空母舰上的战斗机群掩护进攻，但遭到沉重的打击。
    六月十三日，敌机先对已被朝鲜人民军夺取的三五一高地进行疯狂的轰炸。月飞山阵地上的朝鲜人民军高射机枪手们和步兵部队战士们一起，以猛烈的火力迎击来犯的敌机，先后打落敌机七架。在这一天，高射机枪手郑常武一个人就打落了敌机两架。
    六月十五日，敌军开始向三五一高地、二零零高地和狙击手高地发起攻击，并出动敌机四百五十架次作掩护。然而在人民军强大而准确的火力的打击下，敌机不敢轻易侵入人民军阵地的上空，把数千颗炸弹投在远离阵地的居民区和农田里。在这一天，人民军又打落、打伤冒险窜近阵地的敌机七架。
    在此以前，月飞山阵地上的高射机枪手们在六月二日、三日和五日的三天中，曾打落了来犯的敌机四架。
