Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: A commentator in "Pravda," Kraminov, has written an analysis of the increasingly sharp contradictions within the North Atlantic bloc. He wrote: Whenever Soviet newspapers talk about the differences between capitalist powers, the American and British bourgeois newspapers clamor and insist that this is a "communist propaganda trick" to sow discord between Britain and the United States. These newspapers and politicians of the North Atlantic Group countries vigorously swear that there are no contradictions between them and that they are loyal to each other. However, despite their vows, the iron facts remain. The contradictions between the economic and political interests of the capitalist powers have reached such a point that there is struggle at any time and in any place. "The Wall Street and Business Analyst Journal," a mouthpiece of American capitalists, recently published two articles acknowledging the serious economic contradictions between Britain and the United States. The British "Observer" also recently published a commentary on the growing contradictions between France and West Germany.

Kraminov said that the adventurous approach of American foreign policy has caused serious concern in Western Europe. Recently, Washington has issued more and more bellicose speeches. London and Paris have shown a cold attitude towards these speeches. Many British politicians have constantly demanded in their speeches that sharp international problems be resolved through consultation rather than through arbitrary means. British politicians have a more sober view of the general situation in the world, especially the situation in Eastern Europe. They warn their partners across the Atlantic to pay attention to the dangers of the adventurous policies that the most rampant elements of the American ruling group are currently trying to implement.

According to news reports, American diplomats do not intend to discuss the issues raised by their Western European partners at the tripartite foreign ministers' meeting of the U.S., Britain, and France, which began on July 10. From the comments of American observers, it can be seen that the British and French foreign ministers are not so much in talks with the US Secretary of State, but rather reporting to him and listening to his instructions - instructions on what the British and French governments should do in Egypt, Indochina and elsewhere. Undoubtedly, the tripartite foreign ministers' meeting of the U.S., Britain, and France will not only fail to reduce but will increase the friction and confusion within the North Atlantic bloc.

    “真理报”评论员分析北大西洋集团内部日益尖锐的矛盾
    美英法三外长会议只会增加它们之间的摩擦
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：“真理报”评论员克拉米诺夫撰文分析了北大西洋集团内部日益尖锐的矛盾。他写道：每当苏联报纸谈到资本主义大国之间的分歧的时候，美国和英国资产阶级报纸便大吵大嚷，硬说这是企图离间英国和美国的“共产党宣传诡计”。这些报纸和北大西洋集团国家的政客们起劲地发誓，他们之间没有矛盾，相互间是忠诚的。但是，发誓尽管发誓，铁的事实还是铁的事实。资本主义大国间的经济利益和政治利益的矛盾已达到这样的地步，以致在任何时间、任何地方都有斗争。美国资本家喉舌“华尔街与商业分析家杂志”最近刊载了两篇承认英美之间严重的经济矛盾的文章。英国“观察家报”最近也发表了关于法国与西德之间矛盾日益加深的评论。
    克拉米诺夫说，美国外交政策的冒险方针引起了西欧严重的忧虑。近来，华盛顿方面越来越多地发表好战的演说。伦敦和巴黎对于这种演说表示冷淡。许多英国政治家在演说中不断地要求：用协商的方式而不要用专横独断的手段来解决尖锐的国际问题。英国政治家对于世界的一般局势，特别是东欧的局势有比较冷静的看法，他们警告他们大西洋彼岸的伙伴们，叫他们注意美国统治集团中最嚣张的分子目前企图实行的冒险政策的危险性。
    根据报纸消息，美国外交家并不打算在七月十日开始的美、英、法三国外长会议中讨论他们的西欧伙伴们所提出的问题。从美国观察家的评论中可以看出，英国和法国外长与其说是在和美国国务卿会谈，倒不如说在向他汇报和听取他的指示——关于英国及法国政府在埃及、印度支那和其他地方应该怎样做的指示。无疑的，美、英、法三国外长会议不仅不会减少而且会增加北大西洋集团内部的摩擦和混乱。
