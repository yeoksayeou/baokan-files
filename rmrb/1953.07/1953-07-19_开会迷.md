    Meeting Mania
    Mayakovsky
    Every day, as the night just turns into dawn, I see: Some go to the General Office, some to the Committee, some to the Political Department, some to the Bureau of Education, people all go to work separately. As soon as I enter the room, official documents fly in like raindrops: Fifty or so are picked out—all the most important documents!—and the staff go off to meetings. Every time I come, I request:
  “Could I have a chance for an interview? I’ve been waiting since very, very early.”
  “Ivan Vanech is in a meeting—discussing the merger of the Drama Department and the Horse Feed Bureau.” I climbed the hundred flights of stairs several times, feeling utterly annoyed. But then they tell you:
  “Come back in an hour. In a meeting: The Provincial Cooperative wants to buy a small bottle of ink.” An hour later, neither the male secretary nor the female secretary is here—the room is empty! Young people under twenty-two are all attending the Communist Youth League meeting. As dusk falls, I climb to the top floor, the seventh floor.
  “Has Comrade Ivan Vanech arrived?”
  “He is attending Committees A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.” I am furious, like an avalanche, rushing towards the meeting place, spewing wild curses along the way. But, I see: Sitting there are only halves of people. Oh, what the hell! Where are the other halves?
  “Murder! Killing!” I run around the room, shouting loudly. This terrible sight deranges my reason. At this moment, I hear the secretary's unusually calm voice: "They have to attend two meetings at once. They have to rush to twenty meetings a day. Out of necessity, they split their bodies in half! The upper half stays here, the lower half is there." I was so agitated that I didn't sleep all night. Early in the morning, I eagerly greeted the dawn: "Oh, if only another meeting could be convened to discuss eradicating all meetings, that would be great."
    1922
    (Translated by Qiu Qin)
    (Translator's Note) Mayakovsky's satirical poem targeting bureaucrats was published in "Izvestia" in 1922. Lenin read it and said at the Party group meeting of the All-Russian Congress of Metalworkers: "He thoroughly mocks meetings in his poem, mocks some Communists who are always holding meetings, meetings. I don't know about the poem, but politically I guarantee it is completely correct."

    开会迷
    马雅可夫斯基
    每天，当黑夜刚刚化为黎明，我就看见：有人去总署，有人去委员会，有人去政治部，有人去教育局，人们都分别去上班。刚一走进房里，公文就雨点儿似地飞来：挑拣出五十来份——都是最重要的公文！——职员们就分头去开会。每次来到，我都请求：
  “能不能给我一个接见的机会？我老早老早就来等候。”
  “伊万·万内奇开会去了——讨论戏剧部和饲马局合并的问题。”一百层楼梯爬上了好几次，心中厌烦透了。可又给你说：
  “叫你一个钟头以后再来。在开会：省合作社要买一小瓶墨水。”一个钟头以后，男秘书，女秘书全都不在这里——室内空无一人！二十二岁以下的青年都在开共青团的会议。当天色傍晚，我又爬上七层楼的最高一层。
  “伊万·万内奇同志来了没有？”
  “正在出席甲、乙、丙、丁、戊、己、庚、辛委员会。”我愤怒万分，像雪崩似地，冲向会场，一路上喷吐着野蛮的咒骂。可是，我看到：坐着的都是半截的人。噢，活见鬼！那半截在哪儿呢？
  “砍死人了！杀死人了！”我满屋乱转着，大声叫喊。这可怕的景象使我的理智失去了常轨。这时，我却听见秘书异常平静的声音：“他们一下子要出席两个会。一天要赶二十个会。不得已，才把身子劈开！齐腰以上留在这里，下半截在那里。”我激动得整夜都没有睡着觉。一大清早，我就满怀希望地去迎接黎明：“噢，假使能再召开一次会，来讨论根绝一切会议，那该多好。”
    一九二二年
    （丘琴译）
    （译者附记）马雅可夫斯基的这首针对着官僚主义者的讽刺诗，一九二二年发表在“消息报”上。列宁读了，曾在全俄制铁工业工人大会的党团会议上说：“他在他的诗里彻头彻尾地嘲笑开会，嘲笑一些共产党员老是开会，开会，我不知道诗怎么样，可是，在政治上我包管这是完全正确的。”
