The Zhu Shide group of the heavy parts workshop of the Shanghai Qiujiang Machine Factory, consciously observing labor discipline and displaying the spirit of being masters of the country, has actively improved its technology and production in recent months. Not restricted by backward quotas, and not satisfied with reaching the maximum bonus amount, they are constantly exceeding quotas and raising quotas, creating more wealth for the country.

The production quotas of the Qiujiang Machine Factory were revised in October last year and have been used ever since. This quota was revised based on incomplete original records, and therefore, it lags far behind the actual capabilities of the workers. At that time, the factory leaders also considered this point, fearing that if workers exceeded the quota by a large amount, the bonus payments would be too high, affecting production costs. Therefore, they made a rigid regulation in the bonus system: "The maximum amount of overtime bonus that each person can receive each month cannot exceed sixty-five units." In this way, the enthusiasm of the workers was invisibly restricted. A few workers, after exceeding eighty-five work hours, estimated that they could get sixty-five units of overtime bonus, and the idea of "stopping" emerged. However, the workers in Zhu Shide's group never stopped at this limit of bonus amount. They enthusiastically headed towards a common goal: to continuously break through quotas and raise quotas, so that the motherland could embark on industrialization as soon as possible. Therefore, the overtime hours per month for each of them often ranged from 100 hours to 250 hours. In production, they were not only not restricted by backward quotas, but also took the initiative to ask the superiors to raise the quotas for several major products in the group, some even more than once. For example, the processing of boring machine oil pump bodies on milling machines originally had a quota of five hours. In March, after improving the tools, they improved efficiency and automatically proposed to the superiors to reduce the work hour quota for this part to three hours. Recently, due to skilled operation and further improvement in efficiency, they again reduced this quota to one hour and thirty minutes. The quotas for other parts, such as the cover plate of the internal grinder, the height gauge, and the boring machine shim, have also been greatly improved.

After the quotas were raised, the workers of Zhu Shide's group still exceeded their monthly production tasks. In March, the workshop director asked them to complete 2,296 parts, which was more than 1,000 hours beyond the quota, but they completed 3,563 pieces. In April, the workshop director increased their production task to 2,785 pieces, but they completed 3,992 pieces. In May, the workshop director again increased their production task to 2,899 pieces, but they completed 3,352 pieces. Moreover, the product qualification rate has been above 98% for three months.

The reason why Zhu Shide's group can continuously break through quotas and raise quotas is mainly because they have improved their class consciousness under the education of the Party, consciously abide by labor discipline, and have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm in production. They often read the handover notes in the toolbox before starting work, looking for any important matters explained by the previous shift, and then contact the production team leader to allocate tools, check machine tools, and prepare for production. As soon as the work bell rings, everyone starts the machine and carries out production in a tense manner, without leaving the machine tool for no reason, and without casual talking and laughing. Sometimes, when the workpiece is finished, the crane is not available for transportation, they never wait passively. If they can move it, they move it themselves; if they can't move it, they lift it together to reduce idle working hours. They wash their hands and sort out their tools only after the work bell rings. In the past few months, the attendance rate of this group has always been maintained at over 99%, and the phenomenon of absenteeism and leave without reason has been completely eliminated. In particular, Zhu Shide and Chen Weichu, the two production team leaders, have modeled compliance with labor discipline and taken the lead actively in production. Master Chen Weichu did not take a leave last year. According to the factory's regulations, he had seven days of vacation in March this year, but he returned to the factory to take care of production before he had spent half of his vacation at home.

The workers of the Zhu Shide group have also displayed great creativity in production. In the past three months, this group has put forward two rationalization proposals and more than 20 opinions on improving production, which have played a great role in breaking through quotas and raising quotas. For example, the scribing work of the height gauge is a work with very strict precision. In the past, it was operated with one knife, which was very slow, taking twelve hours to complete each piece, and often making mistakes. Zhu Shide and young worker Zhou Yongxiang took the initiative to find ways to improve it, installing seventeen knives on the milling machine to cut together. After many studies, they finally succeeded in the experiment. Now it is not easy to make mistakes when scribing, and it takes less than two hours to scribe one piece.

The reason why the workers of Zhu Shide's group have achieved the above results is also because they have practical and feasible covenants and systems to guarantee it. They revise the covenant once a month, and each month's covenant has a prominent political slogan to promote production. In addition, they have established four systems based on the actual situation in the group: machine tool inspection, tool management, production statistics, and technical research. Each system is assigned a person to be responsible for, which is also a reliable guarantee for the continuous improvement of production efficiency. For example, the comrades responsible for machine inspection supervise the group to maintain the machines very well. Every night shift after work, all the comrades in the group wipe the main parts of each machine clean, and thoroughly check the machine every Saturday, adding oil and cleaning it as if it were new. At the same time, they also pay attention to the load-bearing capacity of the machine tool. When processing large workpieces, they also carefully calculate the time to avoid leaving it on the machine tool overnight, which affects the precision. Therefore, in the past three months, the whole group has not had any responsibility accidents of machine damage, giving full play to the efficiency of the machine tool. In the past, because there were few tools, and each person managed them separately, it seemed even more insufficient. When working, it was often necessary to rummage through the toolbox, wasting a lot of time. Since the establishment of the tool management system, the tools are managed uniformly and used centrally. In the past three months, no tool has been lost or damaged, and the difficulty of having too few tools has been initially solved, overcoming the phenomenon of wasting production time due to rummaging for tools.

This time, in the discussion of the national plan, the Party Committee of the factory selected the Zhu Shide group as the key point, preparing to learn from the discussion of this group to revise the quota and promote it comprehensively. Therefore, the workers of Zhu Shide's group are even more enthusiastic. According to the production tasks for the second half of the year, they carefully used the method of detailed accounting and compressing working hours to comprehensively revise the quota. Moreover, when discussing the quota, they were realistic, not conservative, and not rash, in accordance with the specific technical conditions and equipment capabilities of the group. For example, the boring of the boring machine bearing cover originally had a work hour quota of one hour and ten minutes to make one. Recently, their actual ability has been reduced to 53 minutes for one at the highest. This time, when discussing, they carefully studied it and believed that as long as they worked harder, they could often reach the past record, and even exceed it, so they reduced this quota to 50 minutes. For another example, the milling plane of the boring head frame originally had a quota of three and a half hours per piece. In May, their highest record for making this product was one hour and forty minutes. In this discussion, they believed that this record could not be used as the basis for the new quota, because this was an abnormal phenomenon, the quality of the things made was poor, and it was easy to be returned for repair. Therefore, it was decided to revise the new quota for this product to two hours and thirty minutes.

With this attitude, they have initially revised and improved the work hour quota for the boring machine parts that need to be processed by the milling machine and shaper in the group, and the total compressed working hours reach 65.065 hours. Now, they are discussing the situation of waste products, analyzing the causes of waste products, and preparing to further discuss the quality indicators and the work hour quota of the universal grinder.

    朱仕德小组遵守劳动纪律不断突破定额
    上海虬江机器厂大件工段的朱仕德小组，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，发挥了国家主人翁的精神，最近几个月来，积极地提高技术，改进生产，不受落后定额的限制，不以达到最高奖金额为满足，不断地突破定额，提高定额，为国家创造了更多的财富。
    虬江机器厂的生产定额是在去年十月份修订的，一直用到现在。这个定额是根据不健全的原始记录修订的，因此，远远落在工人实际能力的后面。当时，该厂领导上也曾考虑到这点，怕工人大量突破定额后，支出的奖金太多，影响生产成本，于是在奖金制度上作了个硬性的规定：“每人每月所拿的超额奖金，最多不能超过六十五个单位。”这样一来，工人的积极性就无形受到了限制，少数工人在做到超额八十五个工时，估计可以拿到六十五个单位的超额奖金时，就出现了“打住”的思想。但是，朱仕德小组的工人们却从不停留在这个奖金额的限度上，他们热情地奔向着一个共同的目标：不断地突破定额，提高定额，使祖国早日走上工业化。因此，他们每人每月超过的工时定额常在一百小时到二百五十小时之间，他们在生产上不仅不受落后定额的限制，并主动要求上级把组内几种主要产品的定额提高，有的甚至还不止提高一次。如镗床油泵体在铣床上的加工，原来的定额是五小时，三月份，他们改进工具后提高了效率，就自动向上级提出把这一零件的工时定额缩减到三小时；最近，由于操作熟练，效率进一步提高，于是他们又把这一定额再次缩减到一小时三十分。其他如内圆磨床的盖板、高度尺和镗床镶片的定额，也都有了很大的提高。
    定额提高后，朱仕德小组的工人依然超额完成每月的生产任务。三月份，工段长要求他们完工的零件为二二九六件，这个任务超出定额工时一千余小时，结果他们却完成了三五六三件；四月份，工段长交给他们的生产任务提高到二七八五件，他们却完成了三九九二件；五月份，工段长再把他们的生产任务提高到二八九九件，他们却完成了三三五二件。而且，三个月来，产品的合格率都在百分之九十八以上。
    朱仕德小组所以能不断突破定额，提高定额，主要是因为他们在党的教育下提高了阶级觉悟，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，在生产上发挥了高度的积极性。他们往往在上班前翻阅工具箱内的交班字条，看上一班有什么重要事情交代，随即与生产小组长联系，分配工具，检查机床，做好生产准备工作。上班钟一响，大家就开动机器紧张地进行生产，无故不离开机床，不随意谈笑。有时，工作物做好了，行车来不及搬运，他们从不消极地等，搬得动就自己搬，搬不动的就大家抬，以减少闲置工时，下班钟响了，他们才洗手整理工具。几个月来，这个小组的出勤率一向保持在百分之九十九以上，无故旷工、请假的现象已完全消灭。特别是朱仕德和陈蔚初两个生产小组长，模范地遵守劳动纪律，在生产上积极带头。陈蔚初老师傅去年一年没有请假，按照厂里规定，今年三月份有七天休假，但他在家里还没度过假期的一半，就又回到厂里来照顾生产。
    朱仕德小组的工人在生产上还发挥了很大的创造性。三个月来，这个小组提出了合理化建议两条和改进生产的意见二十多条，对突破定额、提高定额起了很大的作用。如高度尺的刻线工作，是个精密度很严的工作，过去用一把刀操作，刻起来很慢，每把完工需要十二个小时，而且还经常刻错，朱仕德和青工周永祥主动想办法改进，在铣床上安装十七把刀一道切削，经过多次研究，终于试验成功，现在刻起来不容易出错，刻好一把还不到两小时。
    朱仕德小组的工人所以获得上述成绩，还因为他们有切实可行的公约和制度来保证。他们每月修订一次公约，每月的公约都有一个突出的政治口号来推动生产。此外，他们并从组内实际情况出发，建立了机床检查、工具管理、生产统计、技术研究等四种制度，每种制度都指定专人负责，这对生产效率的不断提高也是个可靠的保证。如负责机器检查的同志，督促组内把机器保养得很好，每天夜班放工，全组同志把每台机器的主要部分都揩得清清爽爽，每星期六还把机器彻底检查一次，加上机油，擦洗得像新的一样。同时他们对机床的负重也很重视，大件工作物在加工时还细细算好时间，不使它在机床上过夜而影响精密度。因此三个月来，全组没有发生过任何机床损坏的责任事故，充分发挥了机床的效能。过去因为工具少，加之各人分散管理，更显得不够用，干活时常常要到工具箱内东翻西找，浪费很多时间。自建立工具管理制度后，工具统一管理，集中使用，三个月来没有遗失过一件工具，也没有损坏过工具，初步解决了工具少的困难，克服了因乱找工具浪费生产时间的现象。
    这次，在讨论国家计划中，该厂党委会选择朱仕德小组为重点，准备从这一个小组的讨论中吸取修订定额的经验，全面推广。因此，朱仕德小组的工人更是热情澎湃。他们根据下半年的生产任务，认真地用算细账、压缩工时等办法来全面修改定额，而且在讨论定额时，按照组内的具体技术条件和设备能力，实事求是，不保守，不冒进。如镗床轴承盖的镗孔，原来的工时定额是一小时十分做一只，他们近来实际的能力，最高曾减到五十三分钟一只。这次在讨论时，他们仔细研究了一下，认为只要加一把劲，可以经常达到过去的最高纪录，甚至还可以超过，于是把这一定额缩减到五十分钟。又如镗头盖架铣平面，原来每只的定额是三小时半，五月份，他们做这项产品的最高纪录是一点四十分，在这次讨论时，他们认为不能以这个纪录作为新定额的根据，因为这是反常的现象，做出来的东西品质低劣，容易发生退修，于是决定把这一产品的新定额修订成二点三十分。
    他们就以这种态度，把需要该组铣床和牛头刨床加工的镗床零件的工时定额初步修改、提高了，总共压缩的工时达六五、○六五工时。现在，他们正在讨论废品的情形，分析废品产生的原因，准备进一步讨论质量指标和万能磨床的工时定额。
