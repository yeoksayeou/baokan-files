	Revolutionary Historical Sites Under Construction in Zunyi City
	Revolutionary historical sites and a cultural palace are under construction in Zunyi City, Guizhou Province. Zunyi is a famous city in the history of the Chinese revolution. In January 1935, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held the famous "Zunyi Conference" here. After the liberation of Zunyi City, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Zunyi Conference Memorial Square and the Zunyi Conference Memorial Park were built. In order to meet the needs of the cultural life of the working people, the local People's Government started constructing a Labor People's Cultural Palace at the Zunyi Conference Memorial Square on September 1 last year. This Cultural Palace was officially completed on July 15 this year. At the completion ceremony, Li Subo, Secretary of the CPC Zunyi Local Committee and Commissioner of the Zunyi Special District of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government, cut the ribbon, and the Guizhou National Song and Dance Troupe also performed wonderful programs.
	
	Sichuan Film Projection Team Goes Deep into Tibetan Autonomous Region
	In March of this year, the fourth and twentieth squads of the Film Education Work Team of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau went deep into the Tibetan Autonomous Region to screen films. The projection teams successively arrived in Weizhou, Li County, Zagu'nao, Matang, Suomo, Zhuokeji, Daosijia and other places, and were warmly welcomed by the Tibetan compatriots.
	
	There are eight comrades in these two squads, four of whom are ethnic minority comrades. They are very enthusiastic about their work. Although they live in tents and eat buttered tsampa on high mountains with dry and cold climates and altitudes of more than 4,000 meters above sea level, they still insist on working.
	
	In order to make the Tibetan people understand the content of the films, the projection team used Tibetan to publicize to the audience before and after the screening; they also went deep into the audience to explain; and the Han staff in the film team actively learned Tibetan. After watching the films, the Tibetan compatriots received a profound education. The Tibetan compatriots in Baozuo Tufang were envious and happy when they saw the Tibetan people's representatives going to Beijing and shaking hands with Chairman Mao in the film "The Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities." The screening of the film "The Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia" made the ethnic minorities more deeply feel the greatness of Chairman Mao's national policy.
	
	Tibet Military Region Performing Arts Troupe and Film Projection Team Tour and Perform in Various Parts of Tibet
	The performing arts troupes and film projection teams of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army toured Taizhao, Yadong, and along the Lhasa River and Yarlung Zangbo River in the first half of this year, and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of Tibetan people. During the three-month tour, the performing arts troupes and film projection teams traveled more than 5,000 miles on the sparsely populated plateau, performing 117 shows to an audience of about 50,000 people.
	
	All performing arts troupes attach importance to using national forms combined with patriotic content, rehearsing various dramas and operas in Tibetan, and collecting Tibetan folk songs and dances to perform for the masses. The film projection team screened films introducing the happy life and construction of the people of all ethnic groups in the interior of the motherland, and produced slides introducing the new atmosphere in various parts of Tibet after liberation and showed them in the countryside. Whenever a performing arts troupe or projection team performed in a place, Tibetan people living in deep mountains and remote valleys came in groups, carrying tsampa, butter tea cylinders, and tents, and traveled dozens of miles to the performance site to watch the show. When a certain performing arts troupe performed in Qushui, the herdsmen on the south bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River crossed the river in yak-hide boats to watch the show. Whenever the performing arts troupe performed Tibetan folk songs or dances from various parts of Tibet to the masses, the audience cheerfully danced and sang along with the songs and dances. When a certain performing arts troupe performed along the Jiangzi-Pari line, they often encountered hailstorms, but the square was still filled with spectators wearing leather jackets and holding umbrellas. The Tibetan-language anti-imperialist living newspaper performed by a certain performing arts troupe moved many people to tears. They went to the residence of the performing arts troupe and told the members of the performing arts troupe stories of the Tibetan people's resistance to imperialist aggression. Gelang Baiji, an 83-year-old Tibetan man in Yadong, also gave the performing arts troupe the bow and arrow he used to resist imperialist aggression more than 40 years ago as a souvenir.

    遵义市正在进行革命史迹的修建
    贵州省遵义市正在进行革命史迹和文化宫的修建。遵义是中国革命历史上的名城，一九三五年一月，中共中央政治局在这里举行了著名的“遵义会议”。遵义市人民解放后在共产党和人民政府领导下，修建了遵义会议纪念广场和遵义会议纪念公园。为了适应劳动人民文化生活的需要，当地人民政府又从去年九月一日开始，在遵义会议纪念广场修建一座劳动人民文化宫，这座文化宫已在今年七月十五日正式落成。在落成典礼上，中共遵义地方委员会书记、贵州省人民政府遵义专区专员李苏波剪彩，贵州民族歌舞剧团还演出了精彩的节目。
    四川省电影放映队深入藏族自治区
    今年三月间，四川省人民政府文化事业管理局电影教育工作队第四小队和第二十小队深入藏族自治区放映电影。放映队先后到达威州、理县、杂谷脑、马塘、梭磨、卓克基、悼斯甲等地，受到藏族同胞热烈欢迎。
    这两个小队的工作同志，共八人，有四个是少数民族同志。他们的工作热情很高，虽然在气候干燥、寒冷、拔海四千多公尺的高山上，住帐篷、吃酥油?粑，但仍坚持工作。
    为了使藏胞懂得影片内容，放映队在放映前后用藏语向观众宣传；放映时又深入到观众中去解释；电影队中的汉族工作人员并积极学习藏语。藏族同胞看了影片后，受到了深刻的教育。包座土房的藏族同胞在“中国民族大团结”影片中，看见藏族人民代表到了北京和毛主席握手，又是羡慕，又是欢喜。“内蒙人民的胜利”影片的放映，使少数民族更深刻地感到毛主席民族政策的伟大。
    西藏军区文工团、电影放映队在西藏各地巡回演出
    中国人民解放军西藏军区所属的各文工团和电影放映队，今年上半年分别到太昭、亚东和拉萨河、雅鲁藏布江沿岸各地巡回演出，受到广大藏族人民的热烈欢迎。各文工团和电影放映队在三个月的巡回演出中，在人口稀少的高原上共行路五千多里，演出一百一十七场，观众约五万人。
    各文工团都重视运用民族形式结合爱国主义的内容，用藏语排演各种话剧、歌剧，并搜集西藏民间歌舞向群众演出。电影放映队放映了介绍祖国内地各族人民幸福生活和建设情况的影片，制作了介绍解放后西藏各地新生气象的幻灯片下乡放映。每当文工团、放映队在一个地方演出时，居住在深山僻谷中的藏族人民，成群结队背着?粑、酥油茶筒和帐篷，从几十里路以外赶到演出地点看戏。某文工团在曲水演出时，雅鲁藏布江南岸的牧民坐着牛皮船过江来看戏。每当文工团向群众表演西藏各地民歌或舞蹈时，观众们兴高采烈地随着歌舞起来。某文工团在江孜到帕里沿线演出，经常遇到冰雹，但广场周围仍然坐满了穿着皮衣、打着雨伞的观众。某文工团用藏语演出的西藏人民反帝活报，使许多人感动得流下了眼泪，他们纷纷到文工团的驻地，向文工团员们讲述西藏人民反抗帝国主义侵略的故事。亚东一位八十三岁的藏族老人格浪白吉，还把他在四十多年前用来反抗帝国主义侵略的弓箭送给文工团作纪念。
