    Beijing Building Materials Company Letter
    Response to the Delay in Construction of the Marble Factory

    The Beijing Municipal Government forwarded a letter from the Beijing Building Materials Company: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column in the People's Daily on June 16th published a letter from reader Yi Haipeng, pointing out the slow progress in the construction of our company's marble factory. In October 1952, we purchased and transported marble-making machinery to Beijing to prepare for the construction of the factory. When selecting a site, several locations we proposed were deemed detrimental to urban planning by the Municipal Urban Planning Committee and could not be finalized. From the end of 1952 to the beginning of this year, we repeatedly studied the factory's construction direction and scale when considering basic construction plans and annual plans because there were no orders at the time and the machinery was old. In March, when the Beijing Fifth Construction Company expressed a need for marble, we decided to adopt a steady development approach of first building a small factory and installing machinery for production, and we submitted a detailed plan to the Municipal Finance Committee for approval in May. We have now selected a former brick factory that has ceased production as a temporary factory site to utilize some of its existing buildings and power equipment, which has been approved by the Urban Planning Committee. We are actively preparing, and we estimate that production can begin in mid-August.

    In the work of preparing for the construction of the marble factory, we were indeed slow in determining the plan and carrying out the specific work. Comrade Yi Haipeng's criticism is correct.

    In addition, the original letter also pointed out that we put the machine parts in the open air. After inspection, the main electrical components of the marble factory are stored indoors, while a few larger components are placed in a damaged shed due to the lack of suitable housing for storage. The damaged shed leaks rain, and the components are rusting. This shows that we have not taken seriously the protection of the machinery and are not responsible enough for state property. We should pay attention to this in the future.

    北京市建筑器材公司来信
    答复大理石厂建厂迟缓问题
    北京市人民政府转来北京市建筑器材公司来信：六月十六日人民日报读者来信摘要栏登载读者易海鹏来信，指出我公司大理石厂建厂迟缓的情况。按一九五二年十月，我们将制大理石的机器购运至北京，筹备建厂。当选择厂址时，我们先后提出的几个地方，经市都市计划委员会审核认为均与都市计划有碍，故未能确定。一九五二年底至今年年初，我们在考虑基本建设计划和年度计划时，因为当时无人订货，且机器是旧的，曾对建厂方针、规模问题反复进行研究。三月间，北京市第五建筑公司提出需要大理石，我们始确定先小型建厂、安装机器生产的稳步发展方针，在五月份拟定具体计划呈报市财委会批准。现在我们已选定已停止生产的原某砖瓦厂为临时厂址，以便于利用其中一部分房屋及电力设备，并已报经都市计划委员会批准。现正积极准备，估计八月中即可进行生产。
    我们在筹建大理石厂这一工作中，确定计划及进行具体工作的确都是迟缓的，易海鹏同志的批评是正确的。
    此外，原批评信中还指出我们把机件放在露天地里。经检查，大理石厂主要电动机件皆保存在室内，少数较大机件则因无适当房屋保存而放在坏棚内，坏棚漏雨，机件有生锈现象。这说明我们没有认真保护机器，对国家财产不够负责。今后应当加以注意。
