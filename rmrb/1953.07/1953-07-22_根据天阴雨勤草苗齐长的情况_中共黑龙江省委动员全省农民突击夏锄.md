Based on the Situation of Cloudy, Rainy Weather and Diligent Weeding Leading to Uniform Seedling Growth, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Mobilizes Farmers Across the Province to Launch a Crash Summer Weeding Campaign

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting on July 3rd and 4th for work teams sent to the countryside to report and study the province's summer weeding production situation. At the meeting, Zhang Shiying, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee, delivered important instructions on the current summer weeding production on behalf of the Provincial Committee.

    Comrade Zhang Shiying pointed out: Due to frequent rainfall this year, the hoeing time has been delayed, resulting in a phenomenon of "grass and seedlings growing together, grass suppressing seedlings, and seedlings suppressing each other." Some grass is even taller than the seedlings, making hoeing laborious (generally costing one-third to double the effort compared to previous years). Serious disconnections between hoeing and seedling management exist in some areas. Many mutual aid teams have disbanded because the order of hoeing could not be resolved, and a few areas have suffered from floods and insect pests. These factors have affected the progress of hoeing and increased the difficulties of this year's summer weeding. The first hoeing has now been completed in about 70% of the province. A few counties (such as Zhaoyuan) have basically completed the first hoeing because the leadership grasped the work tightly and started early. However, some individual counties (such as Qing'an) have only hoed one-third. It is estimated that the first hoeing will not be completed throughout the province until the 10th to 15th, which is about a month later than in previous years. As a result, the growth of young seedlings has been severely affected, and there is a risk of land abandonment. Because the first hoeing was not timely, the second hoeing is equally laborious. These are the serious situations in this year's summer weeding. If these new situations are not recognized and leadership continues in the usual way, it will inevitably lead to reduced harvests. Therefore, the key to leading agricultural production in Heilongjiang Province at present is to mobilize farmers throughout the province to launch a crash summer weeding campaign, fight against the weedy land, and demand a rapid end to the first hoeing, timely transition to the second hoeing, and strive for three hoeings and three weedings, with a minimum of two hoeings and two weedings.

    What should be grasped and how should the summer weeding work be carried out now?

    1.  It is necessary to further and widely publicize the new situation in this year's summer weeding production, improve the level of understanding of all rural work cadres and all farmers, and make a determination to do a good job in this year's summer weeding work, overcome the difficulties of frequent rain and weedy land, and strive to produce more grain. At present, many rural work cadres in Heilongjiang still do not have a deep understanding of this new situation, and are not resolutely leading the masses to overcome difficulties and do a good job in summer weeding; even a few cadres are still using the old working methods to lead, resulting in a bias of focusing on minor gains while losing major ones (such as simply focusing on thinning seedlings, replanting seedlings, and topdressing fertilizer while neglecting weeding). This must be corrected quickly.

    2.  It is necessary to mobilize all men, women, old, and young in rural areas to participate in the summer weeding production front using practical methods. First of all, leaders at all levels must devote all their energy to leading summer weeding production. The provincial leading organs are preparing to organize as many cadres as possible to go to the countryside, and counties should do the same; and mobilize urban residents, institutions, troops, odd-job personnel, etc. to go to the countryside to help the masses weed. Some enterprise departments that are not currently engaged in production can also organize a certain amount of manpower to go to the countryside. In short, it is necessary to mobilize as much force as possible in rural areas (women, semi-able-bodied, students, etc.) to participate in summer weeding. To this end, on the one hand, it is necessary to educate the broad masses of farmers to realize that this year's summer weeding is about rescuing seedlings from weeds; on the other hand, it is necessary to help women solve specific problems such as wages, childcare, and lack of technical knowledge. The form in which these people participate in summer weeding should not be forced into organization.

    3.  Doing a good job in mutual aid and cooperation is the key to ensuring a good job in summer weeding. At present, some places have experienced a large number of mutual aid teams disbanding due to ineffective leadership. In some districts of Qing'an County, more than half of the mutual aid teams have disbanded, which has increased the difficulty of summer weeding. The current mutual aid and cooperation should focus on solving the problem of rational crop rotation, and should achieve frequent rotation and quick rotation; the contradiction between before and after rain can focus on promoting the method of setting standard work quotas, and the extra work after rain should be borne by the group. The county and district should appropriately control the wage issue to prevent excessively high or low wages from affecting the hoeing work, and strive to ensure that the wages inside and outside the group are generally consistent; members should also be educated not to leave the group simply for the sake of earning wages. It is necessary to improve labor efficiency within the group (cooperative), rationally allocate and use labor and animal power, and prevent idling and waste. Large mutual aid groups can implement "sub-teams" working under unified leadership.

    4.  On the basis of speeding up the hoeing speed, attention should be paid to improving the quality of field operations. It is necessary to ensure that seedlings are not crushed, injured, or squeezed in order to protect seedlings, and to avoid phenomena such as missing seedlings and broken rows due to rough hoeing. To promote the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, it must be done according to the specific conditions of each group, cooperative, and household, and within their capabilities. It is impossible to focus solely on processing a few new record-breaking plots and wide-sown lands while abandoning the hoeing of large tracts of land, losing the big picture for the small.

    5.  Flood control and insect control. Insect pests have already occurred in some places, and women and students should be mobilized to eliminate them at any time. The fight against insect pests cannot be abandoned because of rushing to hoe and weed. In flood control work, the masses should be educated to pay attention to precautions at all times, maintain river embankments, distinguish between urgent and slow priorities to repair dangerous works, and do not regard unimportant matters as dangerous works to be repaired, so as to avoid hindering hoeing due to excessive labor requirements.

    6.  General state-owned farms should currently concentrate their efforts on a crash hoeing campaign. It is necessary to do a good job in labor organization, prevent idling and waste, strengthen leadership over temporary workers, pay attention to hoeing quality, and mechanical farms should pay attention to giving full play to the role of machinery and prepare for wheat harvesting.

    7.  Improve the leadership of summer weeding production. Advocate going deep into the production process, strengthening field work guidance, overcoming bureaucracy and subjectivism in leading agricultural production. The "five excesses" in rural areas should continue to be overcome, but it is also necessary to prevent laissez-faire. Leading cadres at all levels must be good at using the working methods of going deep into key points, drawing experience, summarizing in a timely manner, implementing in batches, and combining points and areas. This time, the organization of work teams to go to the countryside should pay special attention to weak villages and groups to help them quickly complete the first hoeing. Regarding policy education, it is not only necessary to carry out effective propaganda aimed at farmers' thinking, but more importantly, to reflect the party's policies through the solution of practical problems.

### 根据天阴雨勤草苗齐长的情况  中共黑龙江省委动员全省农民突击夏锄

    根据天阴雨勤草苗齐长的情况
    中共黑龙江省委动员全省农民突击夏锄
    中共黑龙江省委在七月三、四两日召集了各下乡工作组汇报、研究全省夏锄生产情况，会上省委副书记张士英代表省委对当前夏锄生产做了重要指示。
    张士英同志指出：由于今年雨水勤，延迟了铲?时间，形成“草苗齐长，草欺苗，苗又欺苗”的现象，有的草比苗还高，铲地费工（一般比往年多费三分之一到一倍）。部分地区有严重的铲?脱节现象。不少互助组因铲?先后问题不能解决散了伙，少数地区又受到水灾和虫灾。这些都影响了铲?进度，给今年夏锄增加了困难。现在全省头遍铲?已完成百分之七十左右，少数（肇源等）县由于领导方面抓的紧，动手早，现已基本完成头遍铲?，个别县（庆安）只铲出三分之一，全省一般须到十日至十五日才能结束头遍铲?，比往年拖延了一个月左右。因此今年的小苗生育受到了严重的影响，且有撩荒地的危险。由于头遍地铲?的不及时，二遍地同样费工。这些就是今年夏锄的严重情况。如果看不到这些新情况，照旧一般地进行领导，势必造成歉收。因此目前黑龙江省领导农业生产的关键是：发动全省农民突击夏锄，和荒地做斗争，要求迅速结束头遍铲?，及时转入二遍，争取三铲三?，最低做到两铲两?。
    现在夏锄工作应该抓住什么和怎样抓法？
    一、要进一步普遍地宣传今年夏锄生产的新情况，提高所有农村工作干部和全体农民的认识水平，下决心搞好今年的夏锄工作，战胜雨勤地荒的困难，争取多打粮食。目前黑龙江农村工作干部中仍有不少的人没有深刻认识到这种新情况，坚决领导群众战胜困难、搞好夏锄；甚至还有少数干部仍用老一套的工作方法来领导，发生了因小失大（如单纯抓间苗、补苗、追肥忽视铲?）的偏向，这必须迅速纠正。
    二、要用切合实际的办法动员农村一切男女老少参加到夏锄生产战线上来。首先是各级领导要以全部精力领导好夏锄生产。省领导机关准备尽可能地组织大批干部下乡，各县也应如此；并动员城镇市民和机关部队、勤杂人员等下乡帮助群众铲?，有些现在没进行生产的企业部门，也可组织一定的力量下乡。总之，要发动农村尽可能的力量（妇女、半劳力、学生等）参加夏锄。为此一方面要进行教育，使广大农民认识到今年夏锄是从草里抢苗；另方面要帮助妇女解决工资、带孩子和不懂技术等具体问题。这些人参加夏锄的形式不应强求组织起来。
    三、搞好互助合作是保证搞好夏锄的关键。现在有的地方由于领导不力，发生互助组大量散伙现象。庆安县有的区互助组散伙一半以上，给夏锄增加了困难。目前的互助合作应着重解决合理轮作问题，要作到勤轮、快轮；雨前雨后的矛盾可重点推行订标准工的办法，雨后多费的工由组内负担。工资问题县、区要适当掌握，防止偏高偏低而影响铲?的现象，做到尽可能地掌握组内、外工资大体一致；对组员也要进行教育，不要单纯为了挣工资而出组。要提高组（社）内的劳动效率，合理调配使用劳力、畜力，防止窝工、浪费，大的互助组可在统一领导下实行“分帮”干活。
    四、在加快铲?速度的基础上，注意提高田间作业质量。要作到不压苗、不伤苗、不挤苗以便保苗，不致因铲?粗糙而发生缺苗、断条等现象。推广肇源丰产经验，一定要根据各个组、社、户的具体情况量力而行，不能因小失大，不能孤立地强调在少数新纪录地和宽播地上加工，而放弃大片土地的铲?。
    五、防汛、防虫。现在有的地方已发生虫灾，应发动妇女、学生随时扑灭，不能因为抢铲抢?而放弃向虫灾作斗争。防汛工作要教育群众随时注意提防，养护河堤，分清急缓重点进行抢修险工，不要把不关紧要的当成险工抢修，以免由于需用劳力过多而妨害了铲?。
    六、一般国营农场，目前应集中力量突击铲?，要搞好劳动组织，防止窝工浪费，加强对临时工的领导，注意铲?质量，机械农场要注意发挥机械作用，做好麦收准备。
    七、提高夏锄生产领导。提倡深入生产过程，加强田间工作指导，克服领导农业生产的官僚主义和主观主义，农村的“五多”要继续克服，但也要防止放任自流。各级领导干部必须善于运用深入重点，吸取经验，及时总结，分片贯彻，点面结合的工作方法。这次组织工作组下乡要特别注意到薄弱村、组去，帮助他们迅速完成头遍铲?。关于政策教育，不仅要针对农民思想进行有效的宣传，更重要的是通过实际问题的解决体现党的政策。
