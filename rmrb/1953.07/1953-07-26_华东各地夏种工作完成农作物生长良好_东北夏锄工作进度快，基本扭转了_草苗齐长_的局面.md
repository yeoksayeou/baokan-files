Summer planting work has been completed in various parts of East China, and crops are growing well. Currently, the broad masses of farmers are making persistent efforts to combat natural disasters such as waterlogging, drought, wind, and pests, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops.

Following the start of the summer harvest, East China began the sowing work for autumn crops in a tense manner. Rice transplanting in areas south of the Yangtze River concluded in mid-June; rice transplanting north of the Yangtze River and the sowing of dryland crops were also nearing completion by the end of June. Currently, various localities are generally entering the stage of inter-tillage, weeding, and topdressing. Early rice in the southern part of Fujian Province has begun to be harvested, and in areas with double-cropping rice, the transplanting of late rice has begun in a race against time. Early rice in Zhejiang Province will also be harvested around July 20th. In the Huaibei area of Anhui Province and Shandong Province, crops such as corn, sorghum, millet, and cotton are generally considered to have "full and robust seedlings." Early-maturing sorghum and corn have already reached the stage of heading and grain filling.

This year's summer planting work was carried out in the context of continuous struggle against various natural disasters. During the summer planting period, varying degrees of drought occurred in areas north of the Yangtze River, seriously affecting the summer planting work. Party and government leading organs in various localities vigorously mobilized the masses, rationally used water, sought water sources, and carried out drought-resistant rice transplanting and watering for sowing. After mid-June, widespread rainfall occurred in East China, and the drought situation was basically relieved. Various localities seized the opportunity to vigorously rush to transplant and sow. Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province rushed to plant 10 million mu of late-autumn crops, and Liu'an Prefecture rushed to transplant 190,000 mu of old seedlings and replanted over 400,000 mu with dryland grain. Jiangsu Province also took the opportunity to rush transplant 1.2 million mu of rice seedlings. At the same time, various localities comprehensively carried out seedling inspection, transplanting, and seedling protection work to ensure full seedling stands.

Just as areas experiencing drought were celebrating the rainfall, some areas in Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces suffered from concentrated rainfall and devastating mountain torrents. When floods occurred, local Party and government leading organs took emergency measures, mobilizing Party members, government personnel, military personnel, and civilians to carry out disaster relief. Wuhu Prefecture in Anhui Province regarded rescuing flood disasters as the overriding central task, transferring more than 140 cadres directly under the Prefectural Party Committee and Administrative Office to assist in rescue efforts in rural areas, and establishing command points in Wuhu, Wuwei, Hanshan, and He County, with the main cadres of the Prefectural Party Committee and Administrative Office personally responsible for command. The main cadres of various counties also braved the rain to go to the embankments. A total of more than 900 cadres were drawn from Wuhu, Dangtu, He County, Wuwei, Fanchang, and Jing County to participate in flood prevention and rescue work. After the rain, the Administrative Office instructed various localities to drain water and protect seedlings. A total of 300,000 people and 45,000 waterwheels were organized to drain water, rescuing 70% of the flooded fields.

During the summer planting period, along with the alternating occurrence of disasters such as waterlogging and drought, some areas in Shandong, Anhui, and other provinces also experienced severe pest infestations and hailstorms. Party and government leading organs in various localities promptly took emergency measures, distributing relief grain and funds, allocating late-autumn seeds, and organizing the masses to carry out rescue work. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Association supplied more than 300,000 jin of pesticides and 37,000 sprayers to various localities in the province to support farmers in controlling pests.

Currently, in addition to continuing to fight against various natural disasters, various localities are carrying out inter-tillage, weeding, and topdressing work. Rice fields in Zhejiang and Fujian have generally been hoed three to four times; rice fields in Jiangsu and Anhui have also been hoed two to three times. In Huaiyin Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, farmers are weeding and earthing up the roots of 6.8 million mu of corn and sorghum. After the early rice yield increase inspection and comparison in 44 townships in five districts of Tongan County, Fujian Province, a total of more than 325,800 dan of various natural fertilizers have been accumulated, and coastal residents are collecting marine fertilizer to universally carry out rice topdressing. The average early rice topdressing in Minhou County has increased by 10-20% compared to last year. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Association transferred 53 million jin of soybean cake fertilizer to support areas severely affected by disasters. In the Waji District of Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, farmers have traditionally not had the habit of topdressing. This year, 60% of the 32,000 mu of corn have been topdressed.

Currently, some problems still exist in some areas that urgently need to be solved:

First, leading cadres are ideologically paralyzed and neglect the prevention of natural disasters. The mountainous areas of southern Anhui only paid attention to drought prevention and neglected flood prevention. When rainfall was heavy in June and mountain torrents suddenly occurred, they were caught off guard, causing disasters. At the same time, the phenomenon of leakage in some ponds and culverts was serious, and there was no inspection or plugging. Cadres and the masses in mountainous areas of Zhejiang generally have negative emotions of fearing drought and fearing mountain torrents, believing that "it is difficult for mountain land to retain water in ponds and difficult to draw water uphill to fight drought." In Changqing County, Shandong Province, more than 70% of some cotton seedlings have been affected by aphids, but the local leadership has not paid due attention. After the rain in early June in Huxi Prefecture, it was thought that "cotton aphids have been reduced after the rain, there is no need to be nervous about prevention and control," and they sat idly by as the pest spread. When cotton aphids began to occur, the masses in Shandong believed that "a few cotton aphids cannot revolt, what is there to fear," and "honey aphids are present every year, it doesn't matter whether they are treated or not." After the pest developed severely, they were panicked, pessimistic, and disappointed, and backward and superstitious ideas gradually resurfaced, saying that "cotton aphids are divine insects, the more you catch them, the more they multiply." In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, due to the in-depth development of the two-year rice borer control campaign, rice borer damage this year is lighter than in previous years, and some cadres and the masses have developed complacency and ideological paralysis.

Second, the leadership method is "isolated," attending to one thing and losing sight of another, causing pest control and production to be disconnected. Zibo, Huimin, and other prefectures in Shandong Province placed summer planting in opposition to pest control, entangled them, arranged them improperly, only cared about production, and relaxed pest control, causing cotton aphids to spread and cause harm. Some county and district cadres in Wuhu Prefecture, Anhui Province, were busy with drought-resistant rice transplanting and were unwilling to lead locust control. The Taiping County Party Committee mistakenly believed that pest control would affect production, and drought-resistant work was not done well, ponds and dams leaked and no one managed them, causing the phenomenon of water source exhaustion.

Third, there is a lack of planning in the supply of production materials. First of all, the allocation of pesticides is improper, resulting in the phenomenon of supply and demand disconnect. In areas with severe pest infestations in Shandong Province, pesticide equipment preparation is insufficient, and some areas have surpluses or backlogs, affecting the development of pest control work. In addition, there is poor storage of pesticide equipment accumulated last year, resulting in heavy losses. The Beizhen Liancun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Bin County, Shandong Province, accumulated 1,700 jin of sulfur powder last year, some of which has expired. One hundred jin of flue-cured tobacco accumulated in retail stores in Jiangjia and Beizhen have become damp and discolored, and the sprayers are missing hoses, screws, or brackets and cannot be used. The 4,000 jin of flue-cured tobacco accumulated in Lijin County last year has also rotted and deteriorated. Secondly, the allocation of late-autumn seeds to farmers in severely affected areas is not timely, causing sowing to be delayed and causing soybean seed prices to rise. Sixty percent of farmers in Weixian County, Shandong Province, lack soybean seeds. Yingmen District of Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, is still short of 25,000 jin of autumn soybean seeds, more than 5,500 jin of mung bean seeds, and more than 3,333 mu of sweet potato seedlings, affecting timely sowing.

Xinhua News Agency: Summer hoeing progress is accelerating in the Northeast countryside, basically reversing the situation of "weeds and seedlings growing together". Currently, in the southern region, cotton field hoeing has generally reached the third round, and autumn field hoeing is about to end the second round; in the northern region, the first round of hoeing has been completed, and the second round of hoeing has also completed one-third to one-half. The growth of general crops is relatively good, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows is less than in previous years. The seedling rate is about 10% higher in some areas. Now, the average corn seedling height is over three feet; sorghum is two to three feet; millet is one to two feet; some soybeans have already flowered; most cotton has buds; spring wheat is generally filling, and the southern part is close to yellow maturity and is about to be harvested.

In the past month, in order to effectively carry out summer hoeing in the Northeast countryside despite the rain and wasteland, many areas have strengthened the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After deeply implementing the mutually beneficial policy and rationally solving the rotation problem, the mutual aid and cooperative organizations have brought out the latent labor force. At the same time, many areas still pay attention to improving cultivation techniques during the intense summer hoeing, preventing seedling injury and seedling strangulation when hoeing; and pay attention to changing the phenomenon of people being busy and livestock being idle, ensuring the combination of hoeing. Some areas also use the gap in weeding to organize farmers to conduct comparisons, which promoted the progress and quality of summer hoeing.

At present, in order to achieve the goal of "guaranteeing and improving the quality of summer hoeing," the Northeast is mobilizing farmers to effectively improve their methods, aiming at the slack mood of some farmers after completing the first round of weeding and the shortcomings of being satisfied with the full seedlings this year without paying attention to weeding technology. Most areas have urgently mobilized farmers to carry out prevention and control in conjunction with summer hoeing for the various pests that are continuing to spread. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华东各地夏种工作完成农作物生长良好
    东北夏锄工作进度快，基本扭转了“草苗齐长”的局面
    华东各地夏种工作完成，农作物生长良好。目前，广大农民正再接再厉与水、旱、风、虫等自然灾害作斗争，争取秋季作物全面丰收。
    华东地区随着夏收开始便紧张地进行秋季作物的播种工作。长江以南地区的水稻插秧，已于六月中旬结束；长江以北水稻插秧与旱地作物的播种也于六月底接近完成。现各地正普遍进入中耕、锄草、追肥阶段。福建省南部地区的早稻，已开始收割，双季稻连作的地区，开始赶插晚稻。浙江省的早稻也将在七月二十日左右收割。安徽省淮北地区与山东省的玉米、高粱、谷子、棉花等作物，一般可称
    “苗全苗旺”，早熟的高粱、玉米已孕穗结实。
    今年各地夏种工作是在不断地与各种自然灾害作斗争的情况下进行的。夏种期间，长江以北地区都发生了不同程度的旱象，严重地影响了夏种工作。各地党、政领导机关就大力发动群众，合理用水，寻找水源，进行抗旱插秧，浇水点种。六月中旬以后，华东各地普遍降雨，旱象基本解除，各地都抓紧时机，大力抢栽抢种。安徽省阜阳专区抢种晚秋作物一千万亩，六安专区抢栽老秧十九万亩，改种旱粮四十余万亩。江苏省也乘机抢栽水稻秧苗一百二十万亩。同时，各地并全面开展了查苗、移苗、保苗工作，保证全苗。
    正当发生旱象地区喜庆得雨的时候，安徽、江苏、浙江等省部分地区由于雨量集中，山洪暴发成灾。在水灾发生时，当地党、政领导机关都作了紧急措施，动员党、政、军、民起来救灾。安徽省芜湖专区把抢救洪水灾害作为压倒一切的中心任务，抽调地委、专署直属机关干部一百四十余人下乡协助抢救并分别在芜湖、无为、含山、和县设立指挥点，由地委与专署的主要干部亲自负责指挥。各县的主要干部也纷纷冒雨上堤。芜湖、当涂、和县、无为、繁昌、泾县共抽调了九百余名干部投入防汛抢险工作。雨后，专署又指示各地排涝保苗。共组织了三十万人、四万五千部水车排涝，救出被淹田亩百分之七十。
    夏种期间，与水、旱等灾害交错发生的同时，山东、安徽等省部分地区还有严重的虫害和雹灾。各地党、政领导机关及时地采取紧急措施，发放救济粮、款，调配晚秋种籽，组织群众抢救。山东省合作总社供应该省各地杀虫药剂三十余万斤，喷雾器三万七千具，支援农民扑灭虫害。
    现各地除再接再厉与各种自然灾害进行斗争外，正进行中耕、锄草、追肥工作。浙江、福建水稻田已普遍耘耥三遍到四遍；江苏、安徽地区的水稻田也已耘耥过两遍到三遍。江苏省淮阴专区的六百八十万亩玉米、高粱地，农民正在锄草培根。福建省同安县五个区四十四个乡通过早稻增产检查评比后，共积各种自然肥料三十二万五千八百余担，沿海群众掏海肥，普遍进行水稻追肥。闽侯县早稻追肥平均较去年增加一、二成。山东省合作总社调运豆饼肥料五千三百万斤，支援受灾较重的地区。江苏省沭阳县瓦基区湖荡地，农民向来没有追肥的习惯，今年三万二千余亩的玉米，有百分之六十追了肥。
    目前，部分地区还存在若干急待解决的问题：
    首先是领导干部思想麻痹，对自然灾害疏于防    范。皖南山区只注意防旱，忽视防洪，六月份雨量较大，山洪骤发，就措手不及，造成灾害。同时部分塘坝涵闸漏水现象严重，也没有检查、堵塞。浙江山区干部和群众中普遍存在怕旱、怕山洪暴发的消极情绪，认为“山地挖塘漏水，山高车水抗旱困难”。山东省长清县部分棉苗遭蚜害的已达百分之七十以上，当地领导方面还没有引起应有的注意。湖西专区在六月上旬雨后，认为“雨后棉蚜减轻了，不必紧张防治”，坐视虫害蔓延。山东群众在绵虫开始发生时，认为“十个八个绵虫，造不了反，怕什么”，“蜜虫年年有，治不治不要紧”。在虫害严重发展后，就惊惶失措，悲观失望，迷信落后思想又逐渐抬头，说“绵虫是神虫，越捉越多”。江苏、浙江地区，由于两年治螟运动的深入开展，今年螟害较历年为轻，部分干部群众就产生了自满情绪和麻痹思想。
    其次是领导方法上的“孤立”，顾此失彼，使治虫和生产脱节。山东省淄博、惠民等专区将夏种与治虫对立起来，纠缠不清，安排不当，只顾生产，放松治虫，致使棉蚜蔓延为害。安徽省芜湖专区部分县区干部忙于抗旱插秧，不愿领导灭蝗。中共太平县委错误地认为治虫会影响生产，抗旱工作也没有做好，塘坝漏水无人管理，造成水源枯竭现象。
    第三，生产资料供应工作缺乏计划。首先，杀虫药剂调拨不当，发生供求脱节的现象。山东省虫害严重的地区，药械准备不足，部分地区又有过剩或积压现象，影响治虫工作的开展。另外，对去年积存药械保管不善，损失较重。山东省滨县北镇联村供销合作社，去年积存的一千七百斤硫磺粉，其中一部分已经失效。姜家、北镇两处零售店积存的一百斤烟叶，受潮变色，喷雾器缺少皮管、螺丝或支架，不能使用。利津县去年积存的四千斤烟叶也霉烂变质。其次，供应重灾区农民的晚秋种籽调拨不及时，使播种推迟并造成豆种价格上涨。山东省潍县百分之六十农户缺乏豆种。江苏省泗阳县营门区还缺秋豆种二万五千斤，绿豆种五千五百余斤，山芋秧三千三百三十余亩，影响适时播种。

    东北农村夏锄进度加快，基本上扭转了“草苗齐长”的局面。目前，南部地区，棉田铲?一般已到第三遍，秋田铲?第二遍即将结束；北部地区头遍铲?已全部结束，二遍铲?也已完成三分之一到二分之一。一般作物的生育情况都比较好，缺苗断条现象比往年减轻，有些地区较往年约多一成苗。现在，一般玉米苗高三尺多；高粱两三尺；谷子一两尺；大豆有的已开花；棉花多数出蕾；春小麦普遍灌浆，南部的已近黄熟，即将收割。
    近一月来，东北农村在雨多地荒的情况下，为了切实做好夏锄，许多地区加强了对互助合作运动的领导。在深入地贯彻互利政策，合理地解决轮作问题后，互助合作组织都发挥了劳动潜在力。同时，不少地区在紧张的夏锄中仍注意提高耕作技术，铲?时防止了伤苗、勒苗；并注意改变人忙畜闲的现象，保证了铲?结合。有的地区还利用除草间隙，组织农民进行评比，推动了夏锄的进度和质量。
    目前，东北各地为了达到“保证和提高夏锄质量”的目标，正针对部分农民头遍除草完成后产生的松劲情绪和满足于今年苗全而不注意除草技术的缺点，发动农民切实改进。对正在继续蔓延的各种虫害，多数地区都紧急动员农民结合夏锄进行防治。（新华社）
