Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The first National Coal Mine Labor Model Representative Conference of China was held in Beidaihe from July 10th to 20th. This conference played an important role in mobilizing national coal mine labor models to improve their ideology and technology, so as to drive the national coal mine workers to comprehensively and evenly complete the 1953 coal mine production plan and construction plan.

There were 202 representatives attending this conference, all of whom were model figures who emerged from nearly 400,000 state-owned and local state-owned coal mine workers across the country. Among them were the famous safety production models Shi Yuhai and Liu Jiuxue. Liu Jiuxue is the captain of the New Coal Mining Brigade of the Lifeng Mine of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau. In the fifty-one months since January 1949, their coal mining brigade has eliminated deaths and serious injuries, and consistently overfulfilled production tasks. After Liu Jiuxue's safe production experience was promoted in the Jiaozuo Mine, the mine's casualty rate has decreased year by year. By the end of 1952, more than 20 advanced production teams with 1,000 days of accident-free operation had emerged throughout the mine as a result of learning from Liu Jiuxue's experience. In terms of coal mine tunneling, there were representatives from the Datong Coal Mine's Lian Wanlu and Ma Liuhaizi rapid tunneling group, who created the advanced experience of multi-hole cycle operation. This group further implemented cycle operation according to instruction charts from June last year, continuously improving technology, reducing costs, and comprehensively overfulfilling the national production plan. In terms of coal mine infrastructure construction, the Yang Yuzhong drilling team of the Datong Mining Bureau, where the labor model Yang Yuzhong is located, created a new record of safe drilling of 1,816 meters and 55 centimeters in 344 days from June last year to May 14th this year. The core recovery rate in April this year reached 87%, and the coal core recovery rate reached 90%. The Ping'an Shaft sinking team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, where the labor model Gu Faming is located, actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, implemented parallel operations and deep-hole advanced methods, and created a new record of monthly progress of 74.28 meters for the main shaft project in March this year, and then created the highest national record of monthly progress of 80.56 meters in May. Their creative labor has played a significant role in promoting the transformation and construction of the national coal mining industry in recent years.

At this labor model representative conference, Ren Bishao, Deputy Director of the Coal Mine Administration Bureau, conveyed the spirit and resolutions of the Second National Coal Mine Cadre Conference, and Zhao Yuxiang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union, conveyed the basic spirit of the National Coal Mine Grassroots Cadre Safety Production Conference held in March. The conference also listened to the report of Jin Zhifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union, on "Completing and Overfulfilling the National Production and Construction Tasks with New Understanding and New Methods." The report pointed out that this year, the national coal mine production and basic construction tasks are very heavy, especially the task has not been completed well in the first half of the year, and the future tasks will be even heavier. After listening to the transmission and report, the representatives present further realized the importance of their responsibilities. In order to better play the due "leading role, backbone role and bridge role" among the masses of coal mine workers, and to ensure the completion of this year's national production plan and construction plan, the representatives present launched criticism and self-criticism on the shortcomings existing in their work and thinking in a serious spirit. Through the criticism and self-criticism of the representatives, it was shown that some labor models lacked ideological education from the leadership, and therefore some labor models overestimated their personal achievements and developed complacency, and were not willing to learn from the advanced experience of others; or they were unwilling to promote their own advanced experience to others, and there were tendencies of pure personal championism, economism, and conservatism; As a result, they were separated from the masses to varying degrees. After the representatives present universally and seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism, their ideological understanding was generally improved, and they unanimously expressed their confidence in overcoming shortcomings and further undertaking the major tasks in the future.

The conference then exchanged various advanced experiences and advanced working methods by type of work, and Jin Zhifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union, made a summary. He called on the representatives to return to the mine and do a good job of publicity and organization under the leadership of the Party, and to thoroughly convey the spirit of the conference to all coal mine workers. It is necessary to closely combine strengthening planned management and establishing a responsibility system, actively lead employees to do a good job in consolidating labor discipline, implementing safety regulations and operating procedures, and learning and promoting advanced experience, in order to comprehensively and evenly complete the 1953 national production plan and construction plan.

The conference finally held an award ceremony. 201 labor models were awarded at the conference, of which the advanced units represented by 22 labor models such as Gu Faming, Liu Jiuxue, and Lian Wanlu won the honorary award of collective labor model because they had made significant achievements in completing production and construction tasks under safe conditions.

    全国煤矿劳动模范举行代表大会
    交流先进经验提高技术
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国煤矿第一届全国劳动模范代表大会于七月十日到二十日在北戴河举行。这次大会对动员全国煤矿劳动模范提高思想、提高技术，以带动全国煤矿工人全面地均衡地完成一九五三年煤矿的生产计划和建设计划，起了重要的作用。
    出席这次大会的有代表二百零二人，都是从全国将近四十万国营和地方国营煤矿工人中涌现出来的模范人物。其中有著名的安全生产模范施玉海、刘九学等。刘九学是焦作矿务局李封矿新采煤大队的大队长。他们的采煤大队从一九四九年一月以来的五十一个月中，消灭了死亡和重伤事故，一贯地超额完成生产任务。刘九学队的安全生产经验在焦作矿推广以后，全矿的伤亡率就逐年下降。到一九五二年底，全矿因为学习刘九学经验，出现了二十多个千日无事故的先进生产组。在煤矿掘进方面，有创造多孔道循环作业先进经验的大同煤矿连万禄、马六孩快速掘进组的代表，这个小组从去年六月又进一步实行了按指示图表进行循环作业，不断地提高技术，降低成本，全面超额完成了国家生产计划。在煤矿基本建设方面，劳动模范杨玉忠所在的大同矿务局的杨玉忠钻探小组，从去年六月到今年五月十四日止的三百四十四天中，创造安全钻进一千八百一十六公尺五十五公分的新纪录，今年四月份的岩芯采取率达到了百分之八十七，煤芯采取率达到了百分之九十。劳动模范谷发明所在的阜新矿务局平安竖井建井队，因为积极学习苏联先进经验，实行平行作业和打深眼的先进方法，今年三月份创造了主井筒工程月进七十四点二八公尺的新纪录，五月份又创造了月进八十点五六公尺的全国最高纪录。他们的创造性劳动，几年来对于全国煤矿工业的改造和建设，都起了很大的推动作用。
    这次劳动模范代表大会由煤矿管理总局副局长任弼绍传达了第二次全国煤矿干部会议的精神和决议，由煤矿工会全国委员会副主席赵玉祥传达了三月份召开的全国煤矿基层干部安全生产会议的基本精神。大会并听取了煤矿工会全国委员会主席金直夫关于“以新的认识和新的方法来完成和超额完成国家的生产和建设任务”的报告。报告指出，今年，全国煤矿的生产和基本建设的任务很重大，特别是上半年任务完成得不好，今后的任务就更加重了。到会代表在听取了传达和报告以后，都进一步认识到自己责任的重大。为了更好地在全体煤矿工人群众中起到应有的“带头作用，骨干作用和桥梁作用”，保证完成今年的国家生产计划和建设计划，到会代表们都以严肃的精神对自己工作上和思想上所存在的缺点展开了批评和自我批评。通过代表们的批评与自我批评说明，部分劳动模范由于领导上对劳动模范缺乏思想教育，因而有些劳动模范过高地估计了个人成绩而产生了骄傲自满情绪，不虚心学习别人的先进经验；或者自己的先进经验不愿推广给别人，存在着单纯的个人锦标主义、经济主义和保守主义的偏向；以致在不同程度上脱离了群众。到会代表在普遍地严肃地展开了批评和自我批评以后，思想认识普遍提高了一步，一致表示有信心克服缺点，以进一步担负起今后的重大任务。
    大会接着分工种交流了各种先进经验和先进的工作方法，并由煤矿工会全国委员会主席金直夫做总结。他号召代表们回矿后，要在党的领导下做好宣传工作和组织工作，把大会的精神在全体煤矿职工中进行深入的传达。要紧密结合加强计划管理和建立责任制，积极带动职工群众做好整顿劳动纪律，贯彻保安规程和操作规程，学习和推广先进经验，以全面地、均衡地完成一九五三年的国家生产计划和建设计划。
    大会最后举行了授奖仪式。二百零一个劳动模范在大会上受到了奖励，其中谷发明、刘九学、连万禄等二十二个劳动模范所代表的先进单位，因为在安全情况下完成生产和建设任务有显著成绩，获得了集体劳动模范的荣誉奖。
