"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
Introduction to Issue No. 26, 1953

    The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition of Issue No. 26, 1953, has been published.

    This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Adventures of the Enemies of Peace in Berlin Have Failed," denouncing the criminal actions of the fascist mercenaries of Western countries who created riots in the democratic sector of Berlin on June 17th. The editorial points out that the provocative actions organized by fascist thugs under the leadership of American officers were bound to fail, and indeed they did fail. The reason it was bound to fail is that the broad masses of people in the democratic sector of Berlin and the German Democratic Republic do not support it. The enemies of peace attempted to use the provocations in Berlin to obstruct the powerful movement of the German people to strive for peace and the democratic unification of their motherland, but they cannot divert the honest workers of the German Democratic Republic from the correct path, nor can they divert the patriotic people of West Germany who resolutely oppose the Bonn and Paris military treaties and the Adenauer group's anti-popular revenge policy. No matter what provocations and adventurous actions the enemies of peace take, they can absolutely not weaken the desire of the people of the world for lasting peace. All those who cherish the cause of peace have learned a lesson and drawn a conclusion from the recent provocations of the reactionary forces: Relaxing vigilance against the conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of peace is a criminal act of paralysis.

    This issue publishes the full text of the "Resolution on the Situation and the Current Tasks of the Party" passed by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on June 21st. The statement exposed the inside story of the fascist provocations carried out by the American and West German warmongers in Berlin, and pointed out that the current tasks of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany are: to resolutely crush the enemy, thoroughly eliminate the fascist bandits, lay a stable foundation on our own strength, and ensure that the new policies of the Party and the government aimed at improving the living conditions of the working people, consolidating the German Democratic Republic, and promoting the movement for peace, democracy, and unification of Germany, are implemented.

    The article "The Unified Action of the Working Class - Consolidating the Foundation of the Strength of the French People" published in this issue is an abstract of the report made by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, at the plenary meeting of the Party Central Committee on June 16th. The report pointed out that the unified action of the French working class is developing day by day. During the recent French municipal elections, the united front implemented by the French Communist Party and the Socialist Party workers has expanded in some places to include the workers of the Radical Party, which is a landmark. Despite the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party's efforts to divide the working class, the working people of the Socialist Party are increasingly aware that without unified action with their Communist friends, there can be no real change in the policies of war, poverty, and fascism pursued by the reactionaries. The peasants also see more clearly than before that their difficult lives are inseparable from the government's war policy, and therefore sincerely demand an end to the Indochina War and a relaxation of world tensions. Many intellectuals are anxious about the future of France and also eager to change policies. In this situation, the fundamental task of the Communist Party in implementing the united front is to organize unified action, thereby creating conditions to promote changes in the French government's policies and the establishment of a new people's front.

    This issue carries an article by O. Braun, "The Provocations of the Rhee Syngman Clique in South Korea," exposing the acts of the Rhee Syngman gang, condoned by the American side, to sabotage the armistice, and describing the condemnation of this criminal act by public opinion in various countries around the world.

    This issue also publishes an article written by Vasili Musat, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian People's Republic Labor Youth League, "Welcoming the World Youth and Student Festival." The article describes the active preparations of Romanian youth and the people of the whole country for the festival.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    一九五三年第二十六期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十六期中文版已经出版。
    本期发表题为“和平的敌人在柏林的冒险行动破产了”的社论，斥责西方国家的法西斯雇佣分子六月十七日在柏林民主区制造骚乱的罪恶行动。社论指出，法西斯暴徒在美国军官领导下组织的挑衅行动，是不能不失败的，而且也的确是失败了。它之所以不能不失败，是因为柏林民主区和德意志民主共和国的广大人民都不支持它。和平的敌人企图利用柏林的挑衅行动来阻挠德国人民争取和平、争取自己祖国的民主统一的强大运动，但他们并不能使德意志民主共和国的正直的工人们离开正确的道路，也不能使坚决反对波恩和巴黎军事条约、反对阿登纳集团反人民的复仇政策的西德爱国人士离开正确的道路。不管和平的敌人采取怎样的挑衅和冒险行动，他们绝对削弱不了全世界人民要求持久和平的愿望。凡是珍贵和平事业的人，都从反动势力最近的挑衅行动中得到了教训和结论：对于和平敌人的阴谋诡计放松警惕，就是一种犯罪性的麻痹行为。
    本期全文刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会六月二十一日通过的关于局势与党的当前任务的决议。声明中揭露了美国和西德的战争贩子在柏林进行法西斯挑衅的内幕，指出德国统一社会党的当前任务是：坚决地摧毁敌人，彻底消灭法西斯匪徒，靠自己的力量奠定安定的基础，确使党和政府的旨在改善劳动人民生活条件、巩固德意志民主共和国并促进德国和平民主与统一运动的新方针，得以执行。
    本期发表的“工人阶级的统一行动——巩固法国人民力量的基础”一文，是法国共产党中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛六月十六日在党中央全体会议上的报告的摘要。报告指出，法国工人阶级的统一行动日益展开，最近法国市政选举期间，法国共产党和社会党工人实行的统一阵线，在某些地方已经扩大到包括激进党的工人，这是一个划时代的标志。尽管社会党的右翼领袖们力图分化工人阶级，但是社会党的劳动人民越来越清楚地认识到，不和他们的共产党朋友统一行动，就不能使反动派所奉行的战争、贫穷和法西斯的政策，有实际的改变。农民也比以前更清楚地看出他们的困苦生活是和政府的战争政策分不开的，因而衷心地要求结束印度支那战争，缓和世界紧张局势。许多知识分子焦虑法国的前途，也渴望改变政策。在这种形势下，共产党在执行统一阵线中的基本任务，就是组织统一的行动，从而创造条件以促成法国政府政策的改变和新的人民阵线的建立。
    本期刊载了奥·布朗的“南朝鲜李承晚集团的挑衅”一文，揭露李承晚匪帮在美国方面纵容下破坏停战的行为，并叙述世界各国舆论对于这种罪恶行为的谴责。
    本期还刊载了罗马尼亚人民共和国劳动青年联盟中央委员会书记瓦西里·穆萨特撰写的“迎接世界青年与学生联欢节”一文。文中叙述了罗马尼亚青年和全国人民为联欢节积极进行筹备工作的情况。
