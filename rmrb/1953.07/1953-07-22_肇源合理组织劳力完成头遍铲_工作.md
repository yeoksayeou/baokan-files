Zhaoyuan Rationally Organizes Labor to Complete the First Plowing Work

After solving the problems of laborious weeding and thinning during summer hoeing and crop rotation within mutual aid teams, Zhaoyuan County (formerly Guo Hou Banner) in Heilongjiang Province has completed the first plowing. The second plowing is now underway and is expected to be "hung up" by July 20th.

Zhaoyuan County generally implemented wide planting this year, starting plowing work around May 25th. However, from May 20th to early June, the entire county experienced continuous rain, increasing the difficulty of summer hoeing. Due to the frequent rain, weeds and seedlings grew vigorously, making plowing and thinning generally twice as laborious as in previous years. Farmers were generally afraid of not being able to manage, wanting to start early to save labor and avoid delaying seedling growth. Consequently, conflicts arose within mutual aid teams regarding the timing of plowing, as well as issues like neglecting quality and missing seedlings or broken rows. In response, the county committee proposed that cadres should go deep into the fields, study labor-saving and effective methods with the masses, and improve the quality of plowing. County and district cadres went into the fields, first dispelling the masses' blindly optimistic idea that "seeing seedlings is a great joy" and "the finely planted seeds this year have produced excellent seedlings, a full crop." They promoted active seedling transplantation and replanting (a total of 2,567 hectares were transplanted and 4,260 hectares replanted throughout the county). At the same time, they studied methods for rationally organizing labor and improving the quality of field operations with the masses: 1. Universally promote "standard work" within mutual aid teams, i.e., democratically assess work based on the degree of weed infestation, and uniformly allocate labor for crop rotation. Laborious work after rain is shared by the whole team. A few mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives with a foundation implement short-term contracted work to solve the problem of neglecting one field for another. 2. For soybeans with severe weed infestation, only clear around the seedlings, saving two to three workdays per hectare. 3. Women thin the soybeans (requiring only six workdays per hectare), while male laborers only clear ditches and plow the sides (requiring only two and a half workdays), saving a significant amount of male labor for plowing corn and millet, and applying fertilizer. Women are very careful when thinning, avoiding damage to roots and seedlings, and leaving equal spacing. 4. Vigorously mobilize women and the elderly to participate in summer hoeing, helping women solve childcare problems. All participants in summer hoeing receive equal pay for equal work and a "contracted work per hectare, distributed money per row" system, increasing the enthusiasm of women and the elderly to participate in production.

After adopting these measures, a large number of women, students, and elderly people throughout the county have participated in summer hoeing. Some mutual aid teams that were on the verge of disbanding due to unresolved crop rotation issues have been consolidated. Some villages and teams have achieved plowing, thinning, replanting, fertilizing, and harrowing simultaneously. By July 5th, the first plowing was basically completed throughout the county, and it is expected to be hung up by July 20th.

However, according to inspections, some problems still exist: This year, due to the vigorous growth of weeds and seedlings, plowing, thinning, and harrowing are laborious. Farmers fear weed infestation, so the first plowing was not thorough enough. Some fields that were plowed earlier have regrown weeds. Therefore, although the second plowing saves labor compared to the first, it is still more laborious than last year. A few extremely weedy areas have not been plowed. Some villages have experienced floods and insect infestations. Some farmers have a careless and lax attitude, thinking that "half is guaranteed after the first plowing, just cut the big weeds during the second plowing, and then plow it with a plow." There are also some problems with the work style of village cadres. Some village cadres have repeated the mistake of running around aimlessly, issuing general calls, and providing little specific guidance. Some cadres participate in production teams but do not play a leading role in production.

In order to solve these problems in a timely manner, the Zhaoyuan County Committee held a meeting on July 3rd to discuss the next leadership priorities, determining to continue to widely and deeply educate party members, cadres, and the masses, clarify their understanding of the current situation, fully exploit labor potential, rationally organize labor, and make persistent efforts to seize the "tail" of the first plowing, avoid abandonment, and fully transition to the second plowing, followed by the third plowing. In villages, teams, households where the first plowing has been completed, focus on implementing new technologies; carefully cultivate new record-breaking areas and high-yield areas, remove weed seedlings from millet, loosen the soil around sorghum and soybeans with the help of women, and actively prepare manure for fertilization. In areas where cutworms, weevils, and other pests have occurred, mobilize the masses to capture and eliminate them. District committees should have dedicated personnel to lead flood control, conduct ideological education on flood control for the masses, and make organizational and material preparations; draw a small number of laborers to repair dangerous areas, and organize the masses to improve agriculture and sideline occupations for self-reliance in production in areas affected by floods. Strengthen the leadership of village branches, improve the district committee's leadership methods, and the district committee should go deep to help the village branch discover and summarize the labor-saving, efficient, and technically compliant methods created by farmers to ensure good summer hoeing.

After the meeting, the county committee convened meetings of district committee secretaries and heads of county work teams in three districts to convey the spirit of the county committee meeting; and organized more than eighty cadres to go deep into the districts and villages to promote summer hoeing.

### 肇源合理组织劳力完成头遍铲?工作

    肇源合理组织劳力完成头遍铲?工作
    黑龙江省肇源县（即郭后旗）在解决了夏锄中铲?间苗费工和互助组内的轮作问题后，已完成头遍铲?工作，现正铲?二遍，七月二十日可望“挂锄”。
    肇源县今年普遍实行了宽播，在五月二十五日左右就开始了铲?工作。但从五月二十日到六月初旬，全县一直霪雨连绵，增加了夏锄的困难。由于雨勤，草苗齐长，铲?间苗一般比往年多费工一倍以上。农民普遍害怕干不过来，都想早下手，又省工，又不误小苗生长。于是互助组内就发生了铲?先后的矛盾和铲地不关心质量、缺苗断条等问题。根据这一情况，县委提出了干部要深入田间，和群众实地研究省工出活，提高铲?质量的办法。县区干部深入田间，首先打消了群众认为“见苗三分喜”、
    “今年种的细、出的好，是十成苗”的盲目乐观思想，推动群众积极进行移苗补苗（全县共移苗二千五百六十七垧，补种四千二百六十垧）。同时和群众研究了合理组织劳力、提高田间作业质量的办法：一、在互助组中普遍推行“标准工”，即按地的荒净程度民主评工，统一调配劳力进行轮作，雨后费工数由全组分摊。少数有基础的互助组和农业生产合作社实行短期包工，以解决顾此荒彼的问题。二、先?荒得太厉害的大豆，只清苗眼，每垧可省两三个工。三、豆子由妇女间苗（每垧只需六个工），男劳力只掏沟铲两旁（只需两个半工），这样可以节省大量的男劳力来铲玉米、谷子和追肥。妇女间苗时很细心，既不伤根、伤苗，留的又很等距。四、大力发动妇女、老人参加夏锄，帮助妇女解决带孩子问题。参加夏锄的人都实行同工同酬和“按垧包工、按垅分钱”的包工制，提高妇女和老人参加生产的积极性。
    采取这样一些办法以后，全县已有大批妇女、学生、老人参加了夏锄。有些因轮作问题不得解决快要散伙的互助组又巩固起来了。部分村、组做到了随铲、随间苗、随补苗、随追肥和随?。到七月五日，全县头遍铲?基本完成，七月二十日即可挂锄。
    但据检查，目前还存着一些问题：今年因草苗齐长，铲、间、?费工，农民怕荒地，头遍铲?不够细致。有些先铲?的田又长了草。因此，铲?二遍虽较头遍省工，但仍较去年费工。有少数极荒的地没有铲?出来。有的村屯发生了水灾、虫灾。有些农民存在着“铲完头遍就能保一半，到二遍砍砍大草，再用犁杖一铆”的马虎、松劲的思想。村干部工作作风上还有些问题，有一部分村干部在新情况下又犯了满山跑、一般号召多、具体指导少的毛病。有些干部参加了生产组不起领导生产的作用。
    为了及时解决这些问题，肇源县委于七月三日开会讨论下一步的领导重点，确定：继续广泛深入地教育党员、干部、群众，明确认识当前的情况，全力发挥劳动潜力，合理组织劳力，再接再厉，抢铲头遍“尾巴”，不使撩荒，并全面转入铲?二遍，接着铲?三遍。在头遍铲?已完的村、屯、组、户重点实行新技术；对新纪录地、丰产地加工细作，谷子拔去苗眼草，高粱、豆子用妇女清苗松土，积极准备粪肥实行追肥。已发生夜盗虫、象鼻虫等害虫的地区，要发动群众捕灭。区委要有专人领导防汛，对群众要进行防汛的思想教育，做好组织准备和物质准备；险工地带要抽出少数劳力进行修补，已受水淹的地方，要组织群众搞好农副业，实行生产自救。加强对村支部的领导，改进区委领导方法，区委要深入下去，帮助村支部发掘与总结农民创造的省工出活、合乎技术要求的办法，以保证搞好夏锄。
    会后，县委即分别在三个地区召集各区区委书记、县的工作组长会议，传达了县委会议的精神；又组织了八十多名干部深入各区村推动夏锄。（奚敬三）
