Editor's Note: The report by Comrade Malenkov at the 18th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been listed as a study document for all Party cadres in the "Instructions on Theoretical Education for Cadres in 1953-1954" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The content of this report is not only of great guiding significance for our work in industry and transport but also for our entire economic work and all aspects of the Party's work. The full text of the report published here is the first to be translated into Chinese. The 18th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held from February 15 to 20, 1941. Comrade Malenkov's report was the first and main agenda item of this plenary session. Based on Comrade Malenkov's report, the plenary session adopted the "Resolution on the Tasks of Party Organizations in Industry and Transport," which was approved by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on February 21, 1941.

Comrade Malenkov's report became the fighting program for the Party organizations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for a long period. It summarized the experience of the Soviet Union in developing socialist industry and transport, expounded the Lenin-Stalin principles of leading socialist economy, and strongly mobilized the Party organizations to resolutely turn to industry and transport. Comrade Malenkov's report sparked heated discussions at the plenary session. Speakers unanimously agreed with the principles put forward in the report and cited numerous examples to prove its correctness. The plenary session warned against arrogance, complacency, and satisfaction with achieved results, urging the entire Party to unyieldingly fight to eliminate shortcomings and persistently push forward the cause of developing industry and transport.

The 18th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was conducted in a spirit of strict criticism and self-criticism. The People's Commissars for Maritime Transport, Electricity, Inland Water Transport, Ammunition, Fisheries, Aviation Industry, and Chemical Industry criticized by Comrade Malenkov in his report all received warnings from the plenary session. The plenary session pointed out: If they do not improve their work, do not complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the government, and do not learn from the criticism of their work at the 18th Plenary Session of the Party, they will be removed from their positions as members and candidate members of the Central Committee, members of the Central Control Commission, and People's Commissars. The plenary session removed four members of the Central Committee who could not guarantee the performance of their duties as Central Committee members and fifteen candidate members, and demoted two members to candidate members. The "Resolution on Reforming the Central Organs of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" adopted by the plenary session pointed out that Lenin and Stalin always taught the Party to impose strict requirements on the leaders of the Party and the state. The Party should not evaluate them based on their speeches and declarations but based on their work results. It is precisely due to these strict requirements that this plenary session ensured a decisive change in the work of the Party organizations, promoting the rapid development of Soviet industry and transport.

(I) Achievements and Shortcomings in Industry and Transport Work

Comrades! The issue of the tasks of Party organizations in industry and transport is to be discussed at the plenary session.

In my report on this issue, I will mainly discuss the shortcomings in the work of industry and transport, the shortcomings of Party organizations and various People's Commissariats in industry and transport, as well as the causes of these shortcomings and how to overcome them.

Comrades, this does not mean that there are no achievements in our work in industry and transport. On the contrary, in the two years since the 18th Congress of the Party, industry and transport have continued to improve.

If the total industrial output in 1938 was 1,068.34 billion rubles, then in 1939 it was 1,239.15 billion rubles, and in 1940 it was 1,375 billion rubles.

Thus, our total industrial output has increased significantly year by year.

Our transport work has also improved in the past two years. Compared to 1938, the volume of freight transport in 1940 increased as follows: railways - 10.3%, river transport - 12.8%, short-sea transport - 15.1%.

Last year, the Soviet Union made significant progress in implementing the Third Five-Year Plan, expanding production and freight transport volumes, ensuring the further development of the Soviet national economy and the consolidation of national defense capabilities. Achievements in mastering new technologies and the development of defense industries have enabled us to significantly strengthen the technical equipment of the Red Army and the Red Navy with various modern weapons.

Comrade Stalin said at the 18th Congress of the Party that to surpass the major capitalist countries economically, one must first have a sincere and brave will to advance, a willingness to sacrifice, that is, to invest a large amount of construction funds to vigorously expand our socialist industry.

In the past two years, we have invested a large amount of funds in industry and transport, and many new enterprises have started production.

Industrial and transport investments were 223.41 billion rubles in 1938, 250.37 billion rubles in 1939, and 277.28 billion rubles in 1940.

Our Party is tirelessly implementing Comrade Stalin's teachings on the socialist industrialization of the country. The industrialization of the Soviet Union is a law of the socialist development of our country.

Comrade Stalin taught us that we must have everything in our hands so as not to become an appendage of the capitalist economy. Our Party, following this instruction, has ensured the independence of the Soviet national economy.

Comrade Stalin taught us that we must develop industry, develop the economy for the victory of socialism, for the construction of socialism. Our Party, following this instruction, has blocked all gaps that breed capitalism in our country.

The Soviet Union is now a powerful industrialized socialist country.

However, comrades, along with these achievements, there are still many serious shortcomings in our work in industry and transport.

Although the total output of our entire industry in 1940 increased by 11% compared to 1939, many industrial sectors, especially locomotive manufacturing, car manufacturing, electrical industry, timber industry, paper industry, fisheries, and building materials industry, are still lagging behind and have not completed their production plans.

Some People's Commissariats, although they have completed the overall total output plan, have not completed the plans for many important products. For example, the People's Commissariat of Light Industry, the People's Commissariat of Food Industry, and the People's Commissariat of Textile Industry are like this.

Of course, this is a serious shortcoming in the work of the above-mentioned People's Commissariats. For the People's Commissariats, completing the plan means completing the plan for all products without exception, not just completing the plans for those products that are easy to complete.

There are also People's Commissariats that not only did not complete the 1940 plan but even reduced the total output compared to 1939. The People's Commissariat of Fisheries, the People's Commissariat of Building Materials Industry, and the People's Commissariat of Timber Industry are examples of this.

Frankly speaking, the work of these People's Commissariats is worse than that of other People's Commissariats.

A serious shortcoming in the work of many industrial sectors is the failure to timely utilize new production capacities.

Many industrial sectors, due to overconsumption of raw materials, materials, fuel, electricity, serious losses of defective products, and other waste phenomena, have failed to complete the plan for reducing the cost of industrial products. The execution of the cost reduction plan is particularly poor in the petroleum industry, timber industry, paper industry, and building materials industry.

Important power stations have made efforts to improve their work in 1940, but due to the carelessness and disregard for technical operating procedures by technical personnel, various power stations, especially the power grid, still have a large number of accidents. In the electric power industry, new technologies such as the use of high-pressure and high-temperature steam, automated operation, and the application of modern high-speed electrical protection devices have not been rapidly and fully promoted.

A major shortcoming in railway transport work is that many railways have not completed the transport plans for various important goods, freight car transport plans, and average daily loading plans. On various railway lines, many freight cars do not follow the timetable, passenger transport is not well organized, and the phenomenon of train delays has not been eliminated.

Maritime and river transport have not completed the transport plans, especially for important products such as ore, petroleum, grain, salt, timber, coal, and cement. Due to the lack of necessary coordination between railway stations, ports, and wharves, tonnage is underutilized, vehicles are idle for long periods, and cargo transport is delayed.

Such are the achievements and shortcomings in the work of industry and transport.

(II) Causes of Shortcomings in the Work of People's Commissariats and Party Organizations in Industry and Transport

Comrades, why is the work of many industry and transport sectors unsatisfactory?

We have the responsibility to expose these causes with the frankness of Bolsheviks. The more sincerely we expose our shortcomings, the faster we can overcome them. Comrade Stalin often taught us this. Those who cover up shortcomings cannot serve the Party well.

The reason why the work of industry and transport is unsatisfactory lies in the shortcomings of the leadership of the People's Commissariats and the weakening of the work of provincial and municipal Party committees in industry and transport.

Regarding the People's Commissariats, first of all, it should be pointed out that they mostly adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards their work, they have not delved into each individual enterprise, and they "lead" their enterprises not in substance but formally, through paperwork.

The People's Commissariats do not have a good understanding of the leaders of various enterprises, do not know the situation of the enterprises' work, and do not take effective measures to correct the shortcomings in the enterprises' work. The leaders of the People's Commissariats rarely go to the factories, do not personally help the factories improve their work, and seem to prefer to lead in a bureaucratic manner, only through documents.

The biggest shortcoming in the work of the People's Commissariats is the failure to check the implementation of the resolutions by the enterprise managers. In this way, the People's Commissariats limit their leadership work to the scope of the committee meetings and the adoption of resolutions, without understanding that resolutions are only the beginning of work; adopting resolutions is not for the sake of the resolutions themselves, but for the implementation of these resolutions. They do not understand that the main part of leadership work is not in holding meetings or adopting resolutions, but in constantly checking the implementation of these resolutions.

Many orders have not been executed precisely because the People's Commissariats usually only judge the situation of the enterprises based on the reports of the factory managers and railway leaders, without systematically checking the implementation of the orders. The managers of the enterprises and the leaders of the railways often conceal shortcomings and embellish the true situation of the enterprises from their own perspective.

In the People's Commissariats, the implementation of specific resolutions is often no one's responsibility.

The following are a few facts that illustrate the bureaucratic and formalistic leadership methods of the People's Commissariats.

Take the People's Commissariat for Maritime Transport as an example. According to the decision of the Economic Council on March 7, 1940, Comrade Duklis should have submitted a plan to the Economic Council within one month to eliminate the phenomenon of unmanned ships on the Caspian Sea. This decision was not executed on time. The People's Commissariat for Maritime Transport requested an extension of the deadline. The Economic Council then extended the submission date to May 1, 1940. Comrade Duklis still did not submit the plan. On October 11, 1940, the Economic Council suggested that People's Commissar Duklis quickly submit a plan to eliminate the phenomenon of unmanned ships on the Caspian Sea. Comrade Duklis wrote a brief note on the letter from the Economic Council: "Comrade Lesovikov (Deputy People's Commissar), Comrade Voronov (Director of the Planning Department), where is the draft plan?" The People's Commissar's question remained unanswered for more than two months. It was not until December 31 that the staff of the Planning Department, Comrade Ginsburg, submitted a draft plan to Comrade Lesovikov. On January 2, 1941, Comrade Lesovikov forwarded this material to the Director of the Technical Management Department, Comrade Chikhovsky, who then delayed the draft until January 16, 1941, before returning it to Comrade Ginsburg. Finally, on January 25, 1941, ten and a half months after the Economic Council made the decision, Comrade Duklis submitted the plan to eliminate the phenomenon of unmanned ships on the Caspian Sea to the Economic Council.

I ask, Comrade Duklis, if it takes ten and a half months for the People's Commissariat for Maritime Transport to draft a plan to eliminate the phenomenon of unmanned ships on the Caspian Sea, how long will it take to actually eliminate the phenomenon of unmanned ships on the Caspian Sea? Moreover, it is not known what kind of plan this is!

The following is a fact from the work of the People's Commissariat for Electric Power. On October 29, 1940, the People's Commissariat for Electric Power received an instruction to have the Kharkov Electric Machine Plant supply equipment to the People's Commissariat for Shipbuilding by November 10, 1940. People's Commissar Bulgatirev wrote on the received document: "Forward to the Director of the Military Department, Comrade Kravtsov: Please immediately draft an order according to this decision by October 30." The order was drafted in five days and sent to the Electric Machinery Management Bureau of the People's Commissariat on November 6. The chief engineer of the bureau, Comrade Lupo, forwarded this urgent order to the director of the production department of the bureau, Comrade Alzemov, on November 10, with the instruction: "Please issue an order." Comrade Alzemov wrote to the dispatcher of the bureau, Comrade Kravchuk: "Please comply with the order." However, Comrade Kravchuk filed it on November 10, the day the equipment was supposed to be delivered to the factory waiting for it, as "filed." The execution of an important task was thus sabotaged.

All these—"drafting an order," "issuing an order," "complying with the order," and finally "filed"—are they not proof that the staff of the People's Commissariat for Electric Power treat living matters with a bureaucratic attitude and bureaucratic style? If the People's Commissariat had conducted an initial check on the implementation, would such things have happened?

Take the People's Commissariat for Inland Water Transport as an example. The committee of this commissariat held 62 meetings in 1940, listened to reports on 102 issues, but only 7 issues were resolved and adopted by the committee itself. The formulation of resolutions for the remaining issues was entrusted to specialized committees. However, the drafting work for most of these issues was delayed for several months because the People's Commissariat had no one to check the entrusted tasks. For example, the specialized committee chaired by People's Commissar Shashkov drafted the resolution on the "Summary of the Execution of Labor and Financial Indicators" for half a year, from August 20 to today.

Under such working conditions, any living matter will be harmed. Therefore, it is not surprising that the freight transport performance of the People's Commissariat for Inland Water Transport is very poor.

Regarding the People's Commissariat for Ammunition, I would like to say a few words. There are such facts in this commissariat. In his Order No. 203, People's Commissar Shergayev suggested that the manager of Factory No. 176 "establish a phosphoric acid production shift in Workshop No. 4, install a drug tank, and start production. The execution period is June 8, 1940." The order was signed on June 5 and issued on June 7, but the execution period specified in the order, as we know, was June 8. Take Order No. 189 as another example. According to this order, Factory No. 144 should "draft the work instructions for June (including the compensation for the unfinished work in April and May) by June 1, 1940." This order was signed on May 31, so naturally, when it was issued to the factory, it was already past the deadline for completing the task. Look at the third fact. Order No. 151 pointed out the poor state of technical safety in the factory. According to item 8, the executor should submit the work plan to Comrade Shergayev for approval by April 29, but the order itself was signed on May 4.

Is this a serious work attitude? Tasks assigned to subordinates should be carefully considered. However, the orders listed above can only be violations of discipline.

There are many more examples of bureaucratism, sluggishness, and failure to check implementation. Unfortunately, every People's Commissariat has such examples, but there are no examples of serious daily supervision of enterprise work. In fact, serious daily supervision of factory work is a very important responsibility of each People's Commissariat.

It is necessary to make the People's Commissariats end the bureaucratic and formalistic methods of leading enterprises, to abandon all this bureaucratism and instead seriously engage in checking the implementation of resolutions and supervising the work of their own enterprises.

Such are the shortcomings in the leadership work of the People's Commissariats.

Now let's talk about the shortcomings in the work of Party organizations in industry and transport.

The main shortcoming in this area is that Party organizations have not helped the People's Commissariats and enterprises in their provinces, cities, and districts.

Party organizations have weakened their work in both industry and transport and mistakenly believed that they could be irresponsible for the work in industry and transport.

Local Party organizations, like economic organizations, do not understand the significance and role of checking implementation, and therefore have not helped the People's Commissariats and chief administrations improve the regular checks by the managers of subordinate enterprises on the implementation of the resolutions of the People's Commissariats.

Many provincial Party committees are busy with agricultural work and the procurement of agricultural products, neglecting the work in industry and transport, and forgetting their responsibility for the work of factories, mines, pits, and railways in their provinces, cities, and districts. The municipal Party committees that should focus their main attention on industry and transport have not done this and have not tried to improve the work of backward enterprises and railways.

Municipal and provincial Party committees do not delve into the work of factories and railways, often ignoring the work of industry and transport, not supervising the work of enterprises, not checking the work of factory and railway leaders, not exposing their shortcomings, and thus tolerating these shortcomings.

Municipal and provincial Party committees are indifferent to the fact that many of their enterprises have not completed their plans for a long time and do not take effective measures to eliminate this shameful phenomenon.

Take Tula Province as an example. Comrades from Tula, your factories such as the New Tula Metallurgical Plant, the Stalinogorsk Combined Plant, and other large enterprises have not completed their production plans by more than 60-80% in the past four years.

In Chelyabinsk Province, factories such as the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and the Chelyabinsk Zinc Plant have not completed their production plans by 15-20% in the past four years.

Look at Oryol Province. Large enterprises like the "Red International of Workers" have completed their plans by 66% in 1938, 63% in 1939, and 75% in 1940.

In Arkhangelsk Province, the Shalombarsk Pulp Mill, the Larsk Paper Mill, and many large timber mills in the province have completed their plans by only 40-80% in the past three years.

In the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, the Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant completed its plan by 77% in 1938, 71% in 1939, and 86% in 1940.

The fact that factories are consistently lagging behind can be found in many other provinces, territories, and republics.

Know that the provincial and municipal Party committees should manage all these factories, or more accurately, should manage them. However, the result, as everyone can see, is this: these and similar factories have been relying on state subsidies for many years.

Municipal and provincial Party committees have not properly managed the enterprises and industrial construction projects directly under the People's Commissariats of the autonomous republics, mistakenly believing that only the People's Commissariats should be responsible for the work of these enterprises and construction projects.

Many provinces, due to their poor work, have significantly affected the completion of the overall plans for some important products.

The enterprises in Stalinogorsk Province, Chapaevsk Province, and Sverdlovsk Province have particularly poor work in iron smelting.

The coal industry enterprises in Voroshilovgrad Province, Chelyabinsk Province, Sverdlovsk Province, and Molotov Province have hindered the development of the coal industry.

The oil extraction enterprises in Grozny, Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Republic, the oil enterprises in Maikop, Krasnodar Territory, the enterprises in Bashkir Autonomous Republic, and the enterprises in Khabarovsk Territory have particularly poor work.

The phenomenon of lagging behind in locomotive production is the result of poor work in the locomotive manufacturing enterprises in Kharkov, Ordzhonikidze, and Ulan-Ude. The work in the Voroshilovgrad Plant and the Kolomna Plant is also poor.

The poor work of the enterprises in Ivanovo Province, Kalinin Province, and especially Yaroslavl Province has a decisive impact on the failure to complete the cotton textile plan.

Many industrial cities with large enterprises have not completed their production plans. For example, in 1940, Gorky completed 93.6% of the total output plan, Dnepropetrovsk completed 95.8%, Stalingrad completed 95.8%, Kalinin completed 93.7%, Chelyabinsk completed 90.2%, Tula completed 85.1%, Yaroslavl completed 79.9%, and Stalino completed 90.3%.

Know that in these cities, the primary responsibility of the municipal Party committees is to ensure the smooth completion of industrial work.

A major shortcoming in the work of municipal and provincial Party committees is that they do not deeply understand the essence of enterprise work, do not study the economy of enterprises, and often only satisfy themselves with superficial investigations and shallow decisions.

Comrades, there is also such a fact: many provincial and municipal Party committees believe that their responsibility in industry and transport is only to listen to the reports of enterprise managers at the standing committee meetings of the provincial Party committees. Often, based on these reports, they make some very general and therefore useless decisions for the enterprises. Moreover, the implementation of these decisions is, as usual, not checked.

Another situation should be pointed out: provincial and municipal Party committees only take action when individual enterprises have obviously violated the plan. But before that, no one thinks of helping the factories or railways.

It is necessary to eliminate this rough and careless attitude towards industrial and transport enterprises.

Municipal and provincial Party committees must, together with the People's Commissariats, take responsibility for the work of all industrial and transport enterprises in the cities and provinces. It is precisely the municipal and provincial Party committees that can analyze the work situation of enterprises on the spot, directly, most objectively, and without narrow departmental interests, find out the shortcomings in the work, and help the leaders of enterprises and the People's Commissariats to eliminate these shortcomings.

Comrades, this is the reason why the work of many industrial sectors is unsatisfactory, this is the reason for the shortcomings in the work of industry and transport.

(III) Economic and Political Tasks of Party Organizations in Industry and Transport

To eliminate the shortcomings in the work of industry and transport, what requirements should be placed on Party organizations?

First of all, it is necessary to unconditionally eliminate the indifferent attitude of Party organizations towards the situation in industry and transport, to resolutely shift the focus of Party organizations, and to the greatest extent, care for the needs and interests of industry and transport.

Party organizations should constantly study the work of industrial enterprises and railways, understand their needs, and help economic departments in the constant leadership of the work of industry and transport.

Up to now, Party organizations have mainly focused on leading agriculture. This was correct before the food problem was solved. However, now that the food problem and the annual task of harvesting 7-8 billion poods of grain have been basically solved, it is necessary to shift Party organizations to industry and transport. This does not mean to weaken attention to agriculture. It means that Party organizations have grown to the point where they can equally devote themselves to industry and agriculture.

The most important and urgent task for each Party organization is to eliminate the shortcomings in their work in industry and transport.

Party organizations must help the People's Commissariats and various enterprises to improve the order of factories, mines, railways, ports, and wharves. For this, it is necessary to start from each individual enterprise. Party organizations should show the greatest initiative in discovering new potential to improve and develop the work of industry and transport.

Secondly, Party organizations must help the People's Commissariats and chief administrations to check the work of enterprise managers and the implementation of the resolutions of the People's Commissariats by various enterprises.

The leaders of the Party must understand: it is very necessary to fundamentally improve the work of Party organizations in checking the implementation of resolutions in industry and transport. Party organizations should understand that the People's Commissariats alone cannot supervise the work of enterprises and check the implementation of the resolutions of the People's Commissariats. Therefore, Party organizations should help the People's Commissariats to check the implementation of the instructions of the People's Commissariats by various enterprises, that is, to supervise the work of enterprise managers.

Only under such conditions can it be guaranteed that each enterprise and each railway will constantly complete the state plan, thus promoting the development of industry and transport.

What other measures should Party organizations take to eliminate the shortcomings in the work of industry and transport?

Regarding the statistics of equipment and various properties and materials in enterprises. We must start with this issue because many people have forgotten: without correct statistics of equipment, properties, and materials, enterprises cannot be managed. An enterprise manager, if he wants to truly manage the enterprise and not work blindly and by chance, must have a good understanding of all the assets of the factory, must know where the factory's equipment, tools, raw materials, and materials are and how much there is.

However, as many facts show, the statistics of equipment, materials, and raw materials in various enterprises, and even the statistics of finished products, are far from satisfactory. The leaders of enterprises allow a large number of redundant personnel in statistical work, but they do not have the basic materials of enterprise resources.

Here is a typical fact. The manager of the Kurchatov Plant of the People's Commissariat for Non-Ferrous Metallurgy, Comrade Petrov, wanted to know how much production was not completed in Workshop No. 2 on January 7, 1941. The accountant of the factory told him 81.6 tons, the planning department said 47.7 tons, according to the workshop's register, there were 51.5 tons, but the inspection result showed only 11 tons. (The audience is lively) Comrades, imagine how the manager can work based on such statistics.

Under the current state of statistical work, it is not surprising that such things happen. The Caspian Sea ship "Kaspian" consumed 12,500 tons more fuel in nine months of 1940, but the People's Commissariat calculated that it saved 2 million rubles of fuel. Look at the order in the People's Commissariat for Maritime Transport. They want to burn more coal and enjoy the glory of being a model of economy. (The audience is lively)

The result of the lack of management in enterprise statistics is inevitably the accumulation of excessive material reserves, the purchase of excessive and usually incomplete spare parts, the increase of unfinished production, and the accumulation of a large amount of state property.

According to the statistics of the Central Statistical Bureau of the National Economy, as of December 1, 1940, in the enterprises under the jurisdiction of twelve industrial People's Commissariats, the storage of valuable goods exceeded the quota by 26.1 billion rubles.

Poor statistical work will cause many extremely valuable machine tools, machines, and engines in enterprises, construction projects, and railways to be unused. Often, when accepting new tasks, the manager requests additional materials, machine tools, and equipment, including imported goods. In fact, all these things are very sufficient in the enterprise. But the People's Commissariats do not understand the true situation of the enterprise's work and do not examine the applications and requests submitted by the enterprise, as usual, they stamp and approve.

Where the statistical work in an enterprise is abnormal, there will be various unexpected things happening. In such enterprises, production will inevitably be disrupted due to the unexpected lack of certain raw materials, materials, semi-finished products, and tools by the leaders. At the same time, the phenomenon of material shortages is often discovered only when these materials are needed and the finished products must be delivered.

The task is to eliminate the phenomenon of lack of management in statistics in our enterprises and railway systems.

It is necessary to make industrial enterprises and railways have correct statistical work on equipment, various properties, and materials.

Regarding the use of equipment, tools, raw materials, and materials. Obviously, comrades, the correct use of equipment, tools, materials, raw materials, and fuel determines the production achievements of the enterprise.

However, the production capacity of equipment in our industrial enterprises has not been fully utilized, and in many enterprises, tools are not managed, and the consumption of materials, raw materials, and fuel is also wasteful. Some enterprises leave many lathes and other equipment idle, sometimes simply stacking them in the warehouses of these enterprises, but other enterprises urgently need such equipment.

According to the statistics of the Central Statistical Bureau of the National Economy for eight industrial People's Commissariats (these statistics are very incomplete), as of November 1, 1940, there were 33,000 metal-cutting machine tools not installed in various enterprises, and therefore not producing. In addition, in the enterprises of these eight People's Commissariats, there were 6,000 units of smelting and forging equipment not installed, and therefore not operating.

According to the same materials from the Central Statistical Bureau of the National Economy, in our 7,629 enterprises, there are 170,000 electric motors (total capacity 2 million kilowatts) and 4,522 generators (total generating capacity 340,000 kilowatts) not installed.

Comrades, can we continue to tolerate such shocking uneconomical phenomena?

The difficulty of our enterprises in utilizing production capacity can also be illustrated by the examples of the cement industry and the timber industry.

The production capacity of the cement industry is increasing year by year. The production capacity of all cement plants was 6.71 million tons in 1936, 7.024 million tons in 1937, 7.604 million tons in 1938, 7.976 million tons in 1939, and 8.206 million tons in 1940.

However, in recent years, the utilization of these production capacities has been continuously reduced. For example, in 1936, the utilization rate of production capacity of various cement plants was 88%, which was already bad, but in 1937, these production capacities were utilized even worse, only reaching 77%, in 1938—75%, in 1939—65%, and in 1940—only 64%.

Comrades, you should know that the role of cement in the basic construction of our country is not small.

Take the timber industry as an example. As of January 1, 1939, the total sawing capacity of the Soviet timber industry was 315 million cubic meters, but in fact, in 1940, only 130 million cubic meters of timber were sawn, which is only 41% of the sawing production capacity of the timber industry.

You should know that timber is also very necessary for our industry and transport.

There are often cases where rare and perfect equipment, complex production linkages, and heavy machine tools are not used according to their purposes or are not fully utilized. Using such rare and perfect equipment to perform simple operations or to manufacture small parts that can be manufactured with simpler small equipment.

There are also cases where vertical lathes are used to manufacture parts the size of tea trays.

Such unrealistic use of equipment reduces the actual production capacity of our enterprises and brings great losses to the entire national economy.

The use of tools is also bad. Various enterprises use expensive tools without considering their purposes. Used tools are often discarded as waste, but they can be repaired and reused.

As for materials, raw materials, and fuel, we waste these things almost sinfully. Due to the excessive machining allowance of castings and forgings, many metals are turned into chips. And the chips, including those of rare metals, are not fully utilized. Many materials are wasted due to improper and uneconomical cutting and casting work. Due to the lack of variety in rolled steel production, metal consumption is excessive. So far, the amount of fuel and electricity overused by our enterprises and railways is very large. In some places, liquid fuel is wasted, where solid fuel could have been used, but it was not. The task is to eliminate the uneconomical use of equipment, to eliminate the waste of tools, raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, and to eliminate the phenomenon of not fully utilizing production capacity in our industry and transport.

It is necessary to make our industrial enterprises and railways be able to fully and correctly utilize equipment, save tools, raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity.

Regarding the protection of state property in enterprises. Paying attention to the protection of state property—buildings, houses, equipment, tools, and all valuable materials entrusted to enterprises—is the primary responsibility of the leaders, engineers, workers, and staff of our factories, railways, and water transport. Many workers in enterprises do not understand this, and therefore show indifference and non-ownership attitudes towards the people's wealth everywhere.

In many enterprises, the equipment, raw materials, materials, and tools urgently needed by our industry are scattered everywhere, left to be damaged, rusted, and become waste.

Comrades, you can find many such facts in the enterprises of your provinces and cities.

I can help the comrades from Voronezh Province.

On January 14, 1941, 70 useful machine tools were accidentally found in the snow under the open sky in Factory No. 61 in Lipetsk. Know that there is a manager, a Party organization, and finally, there is a municipal Party committee in this factory. What are they managing? Can they be said to care about the protection of equipment?

Is this not a criminal attitude towards state wealth?

In our enterprises, the careless and lack of care for machine tools and tools is a very common phenomenon, which need not be said. Know that if machine tools and tools are not well maintained, and buildings and equipment are not repaired in time, they will be damaged and unusable prematurely, which is obvious.

In the transport industry, the lack of management in vehicle repairs and the careless maintenance of railways and waterways are major causes of accidents.

The task is to eliminate such manifestations of anti-state attitudes towards the people's wealth.

It is necessary to pay attention to the protection of all valuable materials in industrial enterprises and transport and to place them well, to make the leaders of enterprises cherish the state property entrusted to them (houses, equipment, tools, materials).

Regarding the prohibition of enterprises selling equipment and materials. Comrades, an order on this issue was issued recently. Why was this order issued? Because in our enterprises, there are still wasteful behaviors of selling and exchanging equipment and materials with other enterprises. The state provides equipment and materials to enterprises for certain purposes, but the leaders of the enterprises handle these things arbitrarily and illegally, selling, exchanging, and reselling them.

Comrades, in many enterprises in your provinces and cities, similar facts of selling and wasting state property can also be found.

For example, in Stalino, Donetsk Region, a metallurgical plant in 1940 illegally sold various factory materials worth more than 500,000 rubles to the Kerson Textile Plant, the Stalin Food Store, and the theater.

Who allowed the manager of this plant to handle the state property entrusted to him in this way?

Look at the Omsk Railway, which has sold rails, nails, dry oil, logs, and other materials.

What right do the leaders of the Omsk Railway have to do this?

In the Ural Copper Smelting Plant in the central part of Sverdlovsk Province, in 1940, waterway accessories were sold to the "Non-Ferrous Metal Supply Office" for 100,000 rubles. However, here is a joke. When the manager sold the accessories, the so-called responsible executor of the plant was looking for various materials and equipment for the plant. In the process of searching, he accidentally went to the warehouse of the "Non-Ferrous Metal Supply Office" and saw the waterway accessories he needed there. The responsible executor did not know that this accessory was just sold from his plant, so he spent 111,000 rubles to buy it and sent it back to the plant. (Laughter)

Comrades, the order in this plant can be imagined. Frankly speaking, the manager will go bankrupt with such so-called "business," but because our People's Commissariats usually count all such big mistakes as public expenses, the manager is also at ease. Not only that, but the responsible executor also received an award for successfully buying it. (The audience laughs)

The Chapaevsk Ferroalloy Plant transferred coke and slag to the "State Cotton Textile Management Bureau" affiliated with the Orekhovo-Zuevo Machine Plant. In exchange for these materials, the Orekhovo-Zuevo Machine Plant transferred cloth to the Chapaevsk Ferroalloy Plant. Comrade Sheremetov, the director of the "Special Steel Management Bureau," wrote on the application of the plant manager, Comrade Filatov: "Agreed, but this is wrong. It should be prohibited in the future." (Laughter)

It is said that encouraged by this instruction, the plant leaders soon resumed various exchange businesses.

Comrades, to put it bluntly, these facts of selling so-called dismantled and surplus equipment and materials are nothing but theft of socialist property.

The task is to strictly implement the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued on February 10, 1941, "On the Prohibition of Selling, Exchanging, and Transferring Equipment and Materials and Legal Punishment for Such Illegal Acts."

It is necessary to eliminate the facts of selling so-called dismantled and surplus equipment and materials in many enterprises and railways, because this is nothing but theft of socialist property.

Regarding the cleanliness and order of enterprises and railways. I think that cleanliness is the most basic condition for modern enterprises to work normally, which is clear to everyone.

Not managing equipment, not keeping equipment in the necessary cleanliness and order, will cause equipment to frequently malfunction. Wherever there is dirt and disorder, there will inevitably be accidents and disasters. Working with dirty, long-neglected equipment and using unusable tools will produce many defective products.

Dirt is the inevitable companion and source of slackness, disorder, lack of discipline, and lack of order in factories.

The phenomenon of uncultured and waste piles controlling many enterprises hinders the organization of the labor of workers, foremen, and engineers, hinders them from effectively utilizing labor time. All this will reduce the production capacity of enterprises, reduce products, and deteriorate quality.

At the same time, many of our enterprises, workshops, factory courtyards, garages, railway factories, power stations, stations, seaports, and river wharves are all dirty, with workplaces, equipment, tools, and raw materials all dirty and messy. Scrap iron and chips are scattered around machine tools and corridors. The windows and glass roofs of workshops are covered with dust and lack light.

Title: The Tasks of the Party in the Work of Industry and Transport

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31

Let us consider some examples. There is a famous factory in Magnitogorsk. The workshops of this factory are littered with waste. This is especially true in the Martin furnace and rolling mill workshops. It is said that behind the twelfth Martin furnace, there is a large pile of various kinds of waste, and it would take many empty carriages to remove it. Between the first and second Martin furnace workshops, there is a so-called disputed area in the hallway, meaning neither workshop acknowledges this area as their own. How did the Magnitogorsk factory resolve this dispute? It turns out that it was resolved for the "convenience" of both workshops. Both workshops dump their garbage in this place, and neither cleans it up. It seems that at this representative meeting, the comrades from Magnitogorsk are going to resolve the dispute between these two workshops, because the city committee has been indifferent to this matter before the representative meeting. It is said that the leaders of the Magnitogorsk city committee have visited the workshops and even had to climb over piles of scrap metal and various waste and garbage to get into the workshops.

Is it not shameful for such a factory with first-class equipment like Magnitogorsk to be accompanied by filth and piles of waste? Let us look at the Kurchatov factory of the People's Commissariat for Non-Ferrous Metallurgy in Ivanovo Province. This factory has been mentioned before. In this factory, due to the dirtiness of the workshops and the piles of waste, unrelated metals and dirt sticking to the metals often fall into the rolled products. This defective product has even been given a special name in the factory, called "rolling dirt." In just November 1940, the fourth workshop produced 870 defective items, of which 136 were so-called "rolling dirt" defects. This workshop's losses due to defective products in one year exceeded 300,000 rubles.

By what right do the people of Kurchatov make the Soviet factory so dirty? Let us look at the Savelyev station in Moscow. This station is in a state of neglect and uncivilized conditions. The ceiling is covered with dirty stains and mold due to leaks. Melting water flows from the windows onto the floor. The dining room tables are dirty. The construction of a small room in the station building makes the entire station corridor filthy. The floor of the suburban ticket hall is dirty and littered with cigarette butts.

Can we continue to tolerate such uncultured phenomena? The managers of factories, garages, and station masters should ensure that their enterprises are clean and maintain cleanliness. Responsibility should be demanded from all these managers, from the managers themselves. Managers should be responsible, and they should also demand that workshop directors be responsible. Can we not establish a system of rotating duty, with one shift following another to supervise the cleanliness of the workshops?

We can no longer tolerate the accumulation of waste and filth in our factories, mines, garages, stations, and ports. The era of uncultured phenomena in enterprises must end. A careless and uneconomical attitude towards the people's property will bring great losses to the state.

Lenin has repeatedly condemned poor management, slackness, filth, and uncultured behavior. Lenin said, "If we do not fight against the preservers of capitalist traditions, we cannot fulfill our duties." Lenin emphasized, "As long as we remain silent and tolerant towards such factories, we are not communists, but cowards."

Enterprises and railways must be clean and maintain cleanliness and at least some order every day.

We should immediately address the task of maintaining cleanliness and culture in production. This is the simplest and most basic task, and it is also an urgent task, because without basic culture, we cannot successfully complete the task of further improving our country's industry, nor can we solve the great tasks facing our country related to the transition from socialism to communism.

Soviet factories should be the cradles of cultivating clean habits and maintaining order.

Regarding the production schedule of enterprises. Comrades! The current situation is as follows: most enterprises produce finished products unevenly, sometimes more, sometimes less, and usually concentrated at the end of the month. There is no pre-arranged precise schedule for the production of finished products within the enterprise.

Let us give a few typical examples.

The production situation of the Kolomna Machine-Building Plant in Moscow Province in 1940 is as follows: the production volume in the first ten days of each month is 5-7%, in the middle ten days 10-15%, and in the last ten days 75-80%.

The Karl Marx factory in Leningrad produced 2% of the monthly production in the first ten days of December 1940, 8% in the middle ten days, and 90% in the last ten days.

The Moscow Pump and Compressor Plant completed 3.4% of the monthly plan in the first ten days of December 1940, 27.5% in the middle ten days, and 69.1% in the last ten days.

Most enterprises are in this situation. The workshops that produce finished products receive semi-finished products from other workshops in an uneven and intermittent manner. Enterprises do not have a normal preparation volume in their work, and as a result, they usually spend the first half of the month establishing the preparation volume.

This incorrect work system causes constant tension, equipment downtime, and idleness of the workforce, underutilization of production capacity, increased defects, and additional non-productive expenses. This incorrect system puts the enterprise in a state of constant tension and always in danger of not completing the state plan.

We must end the lack of planning, end the unevenness of production, and end the tendency of enterprises to work in bursts. We must make every factory, mine, and railway complete the production plan every day according to a pre-arranged schedule.

In some people's commissariats, a good system is being implemented, which requires factory managers to report the previous day's production to the people's commissar every day. This daily report only indicates one figure, but it can supervise the factory's daily work. Based on these daily reports, it can be seen which factories are not producing according to the specified product schedule. These reports require the people's commissar to promptly identify the reasons for not completing the daily tasks and promptly correct the identified shortcomings.

This daily reporting system, where it has been implemented, has already had a great supervisory effect on the work of the factories. Previously, those factories that pushed most of their production to the end of the month to complete are now mostly starting to produce according to the schedule, producing the specified quantity of finished products every day.

Comrades! Can we not implement this system in all our people's commissariats and supervise the work of enterprises on a daily basis? It is completely possible to establish a system where the people's commissar gets a concise report of the previous day's production of the factory as soon as he comes to work in the morning.

Regarding technical operation discipline. The biggest flaw in our enterprise work is the laxity of technical operation discipline, the lack of detailed production technical operation procedures, the arbitrary violation of the approved blueprints, and the irresponsible change of product structures without prior careful testing. In many factories, there is still the phenomenon of arbitrarily violating the established production technical operation system, changing processing methods, and not adhering to the specified product tolerances.

Factory managers, chief engineers, and chief process engineers do not properly supervise the implementation of technical operation procedures, do not pay attention to precise work according to the blueprints, and push the approval of technical documents and blueprints, which are extremely important, to secondary personnel.

Therefore, the technical documents and blueprints on which the technical operation process is based are often in great disorder, and the technical operation process specified in the technical documents is detached from its implementation at the workplace.

This casual attitude towards adhering to technical operation procedures, working precisely according to blueprints and product structures, results in inconsistent product quality in batch production, and the standard parts of the machines and machinery obtained cannot be interchanged. Arbitrary changes in technical operations and arbitrary drawing often produce defective products, adding many unnecessary tasks to the equipment.

It is precisely because of the lack of technical operation discipline that many of our industrial enterprises still continue to produce substandard, incomplete, and unqualified products. Although the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated July 10, 1940, "On the Responsibility for the Production of Substandard or Incomplete Products, and Non-Compliance with Specifications in Industrial Enterprises," has already had an effect, we still have many shortcomings in striving to improve product quality. Many economic leaders take a criminally indifferent attitude towards the production of substandard products and the destruction of a large amount of valuable materials by defect makers. Defect makers can avoid material responsibility for the defects they cause. The production of substandard raw materials and the creation of many defects will disrupt the completion of the production plan, disrupt the normal operation of our enterprises, and greatly increase the cost of products. In many enterprises, there is no timely and effective supervision to prevent the occurrence of defects. Comrades! It is time to end the violation of technical operation procedures. We must implement precise technical operation procedures in all enterprises and establish a system to check the adherence to these procedures. The people's commissariats must ensure strict discipline in the implementation of production technical operations in enterprises, prohibit enterprises from arbitrarily changing the technical operation methods specified for batch and mass production without the approval of the people's commissariat, changing the structure and drawings of a certain production, and so on.

Our enterprise and people's commissariat workers should understand that we can no longer work in the old way, lazily, carelessly, and by eye. The new precise mechanical equipment with which our enterprises are equipped requires us to establish the strictest system in production, and our entire work must be based on the precise adherence to technical rules and procedures.

The essence of technical operation discipline is to make our workers, foremen, and engineers learn to operate technical processes accurately and without errors, and to produce products that are exactly the same according to the requirements of technical conditions and standards.

Each of our industrial enterprises should produce products of excellent quality, and highly maintain the honor of the factory's brand.

Comrades! We must make our enterprises adhere to the strict discipline of the technical operation process, implement precise technical operation procedures in all enterprises, supervise the adherence to these procedures, and thus ensure the production of completely qualified, excellent, and complete products.

Regarding new technology. Many leaders of industrial and transport enterprises underestimate the significance of new technology and do not further improve new technology, master the production of new machines, materials, and products. Valuable inventions and new improvement methods often remain in scientific research institutes, laboratories, and enterprises for years, but are not utilized in production.

Many technical committees of people's commissariats have become auxiliary agencies for solving small technical problems and have not seriously studied the application of new technologies.

Some enterprise leaders, for the sake of their own convenience, prefer to produce the same type of old products for a long time and use old production methods, without considering the development of technology.

The planning and design work of various new products, as well as the mastering of the batch production of these new products, are carried out very slowly and take a long time. Therefore, it often happens that when the batch production of new products begins, these products are no longer advanced.

Many talented designers have not received the necessary support from the leaders of the people's commissariats and enterprises, and therefore, they have wasted a lot of effort and energy. However, experience has shown that if we give our designers the task of solving a specific problem, then they can accomplish the tasks they undertake.

The promotion of advanced production methods, the experience of advanced enterprises, workshops, outstanding Stakhanovites, and production innovators is slow, and even in many cases, it is neglected.

The conservatism of some enterprise leaders hinders the further development of production, makes enterprises content with backwardness and makeshift measures, and undermines national defense capabilities.

We must eliminate the tail-endism and thorough opportunism towards new technology.

The task is to make the leaders of enterprises, designers, scientific research institutes and laboratories, engineers, technicians, foremen, and advanced workers constantly improve technology, master the production of new machines, materials, and products.

Our industrial and transport workers must fully utilize the enormous possibilities of the socialist system to develop technological ideas and quickly apply new technological achievements to production. We must pay special attention to new technology issues, continuously improve technology, and master the production of new machines, materials, and products.

Regarding product cost. Comrades! Many facts show that the leaders of industrial and transport enterprises do not treat the people's kopeks, estimate, and save as owners. Due to the excessive consumption of fuel, the non-production expenditure of raw materials, the large consumption of valuable materials, and the waste of electricity, our enterprises suffer heavy losses. Such wasteful economic management is anti-people. It has nothing to do with our socialist economy. The socialist economy strictly calculates and effectively utilizes every kopek, every kilogram of fuel and raw materials, every unit of power machinery and lathe.

Many enterprise leaders are accustomed to everything being provided for them, forgetting about economic accounting, being content with the destruction of financial discipline and poor management, and taking an indifferent attitude towards the material losses caused by their mismanagement.

Product cost is the basic indicator of the quality of the entire work of an enterprise. To correctly lead the work of an enterprise, one must know the actual expenditure of each unit of product in its main components, such as wages, raw materials, fuel, and electricity, depreciation, and administrative expenses, and ensure that the economic work of the enterprise can unconditionally complete the cost plan and profit plan.

The task is to eliminate the state of poor management, to be proficient in the economic business of the enterprise, and to maximize the use of the internal resources of the enterprise.

We must systematically reduce product costs, strive to strengthen economic accounting, and completely eliminate all wasteful phenomena.

Regarding wages. Comrades! Correctly determining wages is the most important condition for increasing production. The principle of making workers materially concerned about the results of labor is the guiding principle of our entire wage policy. To achieve this principle, we have adopted the form of piecework for workers, the bonus system for managerial personnel, and the form of rewarding skilled labor compared to unskilled labor.

The piecework and bonus system is the most important lever for increasing labor productivity and thus developing our entire national economy.

In fact, this guiding principle is often violated in the field of wages.

There are often such corrupt practices: after rewarding some outstanding workers, the wages of those workers who lag behind in labor productivity, do not improve their skills, and do not complete the production quota are intentionally raised to their wage level.

Not long ago, in the coal industry, there was a situation where underground workers earned less than surface workers, and this situation may still exist in some coal mines.

It is precisely because of these shortcomings in wage determination that there are still many workers in our enterprises who cannot complete the production quota. Many enterprise leaders and foremen tolerate this situation, advocating egalitarianism in wages and thus hindering the further improvement of labor productivity. Even when the introduction of new technology and organizational and economic measures urgently requires the improvement of production quotas, enterprise leaders and foremen often refuse.

The task is to reward outstanding workers, completely eliminate the corrupt phenomenon of egalitarianism in wages. Enterprise leaders, workshop directors, and foremen should improve production quotas with the application of advanced technology and organizational and economic measures.

Comrades! We must strictly and thoroughly implement the principle of materially rewarding outstanding workers in the field of wages, which is realized in the form of piecework for workers, the bonus system for managerial personnel, and the wage system that rewards skilled labor compared to unskilled labor.

Regarding absenteeism and leaving work without permission. The implementation of the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated June 26, 1940, "On the Transition to an Eight-Hour Workday and a Seven-Day Workweek, and on the Prohibition of Workers and Employees from Leaving Enterprises and Institutions Without Permission," has greatly improved the labor discipline of enterprises.

However, comrades! In many factories, mines, pits, and railways, there is still the phenomenon of absenteeism. Some leaders of economic organizations, party organizations, trade unions, and the Komsomol have not done a good job of strengthening labor discipline. These leaders understand the task of fighting against labor turnover and absenteeism as a short-term campaign and forget that absenteeism and leaving work without permission are extremely harmful to the state and will hinder the completion of the production plan and reduce the output of industrial products. Absenteeism is a disaster for production.

Comrades! We must completely eliminate the phenomenon of absenteeism.

Regarding the one-man management system in enterprises. Despite the clear instructions of the party, many enterprises still have not implemented a true one-man management system in enterprise management. The manager's orders are often not executed. The manager himself does not use his authority and often pushes things to social organizations.

The manager is fully responsible for the state of the enterprise and the production process, and his orders must be executed. The manager is not only responsible for the correctness of the orders he issues but also ensures that these orders are executed by the staff in a timely and accurate manner.

It is unacceptable for a manager to often use the excuse that his orders are correct and issued in a timely manner but not executed to defend the poor work of his enterprise. The manager should know his subordinates, check the implementation of the orders he issues, and should replace those who cannot execute orders and shirk responsibilities with more capable and competent staff.

We must resolutely strengthen the one-man management system in enterprises and make the enterprise manager a truly empowered leader who is fully responsible for the state of the enterprise and the production process.

Regarding strengthening technical leadership in production. The problems in the work of industry and transport also stem from the fact that engineers and technical personnel are often improperly assigned and utilized in many cases.

Enterprises and workshops, that is, direct production sites, often lack skilled experts, but at the same time, a large number of experts are sitting in the offices of central and local authorities.

Comrades! We have materials on the allocation of experts in the system of the People's Commissariat of Industry (214,000 experts with higher education and 164,000 experts with secondary education). These materials explain the allocation of experts in the industrial sector as follows:

Of the 214,000 experts with higher education, 95,000 (45%) are allocated to work in various departments of the people's commissariat system. 51,000 (24%) are engaged in factory management in industrial enterprises, and only 82,000 (31%) are directly involved in production in industrial enterprises.

Of the 164,000 experts with secondary education, 41,000 (25%) are allocated to work in various departments of the people's commissariat. 41,000 (25%) are engaged in factory management in industrial enterprises, and 82,000 (50%) are directly involved in production in industrial enterprises.

In the People's Commissariat of the Petroleum Industry, only 20% of experts with higher education are directly involved in production; in the People's Commissariat of Power Stations, only 16%; in the People's Commissariat of Coal Mining, 27%; in the People's Commissariat of the Fishery Industry, only 9%; in the People's Commissariat of the Wood Industry, 24%.

Other people's commissariats of industry also have similar situations in the allocation and use of experts with higher education.

This improper use of engineers and technical personnel brings losses to our national economy and makes enterprises lose the necessary technical leadership. Comrades! Just pointing out that in industry, there are many positions for experts with higher education that should be filled by engineers, while these experts are extremely lacking, can explain this.

Among the workshop directors of enterprises, only 22% are experts with higher education. Among the deputy workshop directors, experts account for 32%, and among the responsible persons of shifts, sections, departments, work areas, and crews, experts account for only 20%. Among the workshop engineers, experts account for only 60%. The rest of the personnel in these positions have not received specialized technical education.

Economic management agencies, like our entire state apparatus, are of great significance. A certain number of skilled engineers and technical personnel must work in this agency. However, if this agency excessively expands its staff, making engineers and technical personnel sit in offices and thus separating them from production, that is completely abnormal.

We must correct the abnormal phenomenon in the allocation of engineering and technical personnel, transfer some experts from central and local economic agencies to enterprises, and strengthen the technical leadership of production.

We must use all means to strengthen the technical leadership of production.

For newly graduated young experts, we must establish a system: every person graduating from a higher educational institution should gain production experience in an enterprise, go through a certain sequence of practical work stages, and gradually be promoted to deputy workshop foreman, workshop foreman, and engineer.

Regarding foremen. Comrades! Foremen must play a major role in implementing the system of our enterprises, correctly organizing labor, and ensuring the strict adherence to the discipline of the technical operation process.

However, many of our enterprises have reduced foremen to the status of auxiliary workers and clerks. They spend the whole day either running around the factory for missing parts and tools or busy with various administrative tasks.

We must eliminate all unnecessary duties of foremen.

We must enhance the role of foremen who directly organize production in enterprises, and therefore, foremen should become the empowered leaders of the sections they lead, fully responsible for adhering to technical operation discipline and completing production tasks according to various indicators.

To eliminate the shortcomings in the work of industry and transport, the party organization should take the following measures in terms of economic and political tasks:

(4) Organizational tasks of the party in industry and transport

Comrades! To smoothly solve the tasks of developing industry and transport, we must greatly improve our organizational work in industry and transport.

Comrade Stalin teaches us that economic victories and the consolidation and sustainability of these victories depend entirely on the success of the organizational and political work of the party. Without these conditions, economic victories are like buildings on sand.

To eliminate the shortcomings in the work of industry and transport, what measures should be taken in terms of the organizational tasks of the party organization?

First of all, we should talk about: to strengthen the assistance to the people's commissariats of industry and transport and enterprises, we must, in cities, provinces, regions, and republics with developed industry, establish several (not one) secretaries of the city committee or provincial committee to manage industry, and in places where necessary, establish one secretary to manage rail transport and one to manage water transport, based on the existing basic industrial departments in cities, provinces, regions, and republics.

Everyone knows that now in our party's city committees and provincial committees, there is only one secretary managing industry and transport. Experience shows that this is obviously not enough.

In the draft resolution given to everyone, it is proposed to add secretaries to manage industry and transport in city committees and provincial committees.

Selecting a secretary to manage industry is a very important task for city committees and provincial committees. This task is very important and must be handled with great care and responsibility.

We must promote excellent personnel to these positions. Such personnel must be able to study the business of industry and transport in a Bolshevik spirit, and actually, not just in words, turn the attention of the party organization to industry and transport.

The secretary responsible for managing industry and transport should be familiar with the work of enterprises, regularly visit enterprises; must personally contact the personnel of enterprises and the relevant people's commissariats; must help them complete the plan and implement the resolutions of the party in industry and transport, systematically check the implementation of these resolutions, expose the shortcomings in the work of enterprises, and strive to overcome these shortcomings.

From the results of the work of industry and transport in some cities, provinces, regions, and republics recently, we can also know how the city committees, provincial committees, and the Central Committee of the party handle the task of selecting secretaries to manage industry and transport.

The second most important organizational task is to greatly strengthen the attention of the party organization to the selection of cadres in industry and transport.

First of all, we must investigate and be familiar with the economic personnel and engineering and technical personnel of industrial enterprises and railways. Without such investigation and familiarity with personnel, we cannot correctly and timely solve the problem of removing unqualified personnel and promoting capable and creative personnel.

Comrades! We must overcome the practice of studying personnel on paper and in offices.

We must overcome the practice of nepotism in the selection of cadres and check the work of personnel in actual work, and in evaluating personnel, we should evaluate their work, not their resumes.

Despite the instructions of the party, many party organizations and economic organizations still investigate too much about a person's family background when appointing a personnel, and do not pay attention to investigating the business ability and political qualities of the person himself.

Regarding the correct promotion of new personnel, this is the basic problem of selecting cadres. We must be more bold in promoting excellent, capable, and creative personnel who are good at practical work.

At the same time, we must understand that the personnel to be promoted here are not only Bolshevik party members but also non-party Bolsheviks.

Among non-party members, there are many honest and capable personnel who, although they have not joined the party and do not have party seniority, often work better and more honestly than some party members with party seniority.

Comrade Stalin has repeatedly ridiculed those who think that only party members can be promoted to leadership positions. Comrade Stalin said at the meeting of economic workers in 1931: "Some comrades think that only party members can be promoted to factory leadership positions. Therefore, they often suppress talented and creative non-party comrades and promote party members to the forefront, even if these party members have less ability and no initiative. It goes without saying that this so-called 'policy' is extremely stupid and reactionary to the extreme."

When promoting capable and creative personnel, we must timely remove unqualified, incompetent, and indecisive personnel, as well as replace those who are not good at practical work with empty talkers.

We often encounter such useless, impractical empty talkers who long harm our cause. However, our people's commissariats, provincial committees, and city committees are indifferent to this situation and do not take measures to expel these so-called "workers."

We often have such a situation: a factory receives an urgent task to produce a particularly necessary product. However, the leader of this enterprise is an incompetent economic worker who is not a worker who can complete this urgent task, but an empty talker.

The provincial committee secretary asks this manager about the completion of the task, and the empty talker replies: "We are working hard, comrade secretary." The secretary is satisfied; since they are working hard, that means the task will be completed.

However, it is soon found that nothing has been done, and the task has not been completed. The provincial committee secretary asks the manager: "What's the matter? Why hasn't the task been completed?" The empty talker replies: "We are studying, comrade secretary." The secretary is also satisfied with this answer; since someone is studying, that means there will soon be results. However, the work has not progressed, so the secretary asks the manager again: "Why hasn't the product been produced yet?" "Comrade secretary, there are obstacles in the work, and things will improve in a few days." After some time, there is still no product. The secretary asks: "What are you doing in the factory?" This empty talker replies: "We are eliminating shortcomings and inconsistencies."

In this way, people's minds are endlessly deceived. Comrades! Even if unexpectedly, this manager finally produces a small amount of products, then it is also impossible to expect him to have systematic production. He will soon stop this production, which is inevitable. If you ask him: "What's the matter? Why did you start production and then stop immediately?" The empty talker will give you an answer, and in this case, he will definitely say: "The spare parts are all used up."

Our provincial committee secretaries are thus deceived by these incompetent enterprise leaders, empty talkers.

Empty talkers use words like "studying," "obstacles," "eliminating shortcomings and inconsistencies" as their weapons, living off the state, wasting a lot of money, but contributing nothing to the national economy.

And many of our leaders are satisfied with these answers, but they do not know exactly what the incompetent economic workers really want to say. Originally, as a song sings: "... Who knows what he means." (Laughter) Yes, in the lyrics, it is finally understood what is said. You remember, in the song, with a little thought, the matter is clear. But for empty talkers, the matter is never understood. This is obviously because people do not think enough. We must think and timely expose empty talkers.

Comrades! Now we should expose these economic workers in broad daylight. We should remove empty talkers who cannot do practical work and transfer them to do smaller work, regardless of whether they are party or non-party workers.

Comrades! We have another type of worker, that is, the ignorant. The ignorant are those who do not understand anything and do not want to understand anything. The ignorant do not study technology, do not recognize new technology; they have no concept of technical operations in their minds, do not understand and do not want to understand the economy of the enterprise. However, their arrogance is abundant.

The ignorant think they understand everything and do not need to study. There is no force in the universe that can make the ignorant believe that there is something they do not understand.

Saltykov-Shedrin describes a character and writes: "He is neither a technician nor an engineer. ... He does not understand the process of river formation, nor does he understand the law that rivers flow downwards, not upwards. However, he believes that if he points out: from this place to that place, that is, in the measured area, there must be a continent, and then the river will flow to the right and left as before."

Today, we also have such ignorant people. Such ignorant people, once they take on the position of enterprise manager, railway station master, or any other position, do not want to listen to anything. You talk to him about new technology, about the necessity of improving the technical operation process, about the enterprise needing to be clean and establish order, he turns a deaf ear, stubbornly adheres to his ignorant views, and ignores any suggestions and any instructions. (The whole hall is lively) He says, I have my own views, I can do everything myself. At the same time, he usually boasts of his proletarian origin.

Obviously, we cannot expect such a so-called leader to produce new products, with good quality and using new technology.

Comrades! We must expose these ignorant people and drive them out of leadership positions. We must not allow ignorant people to lead enterprises or engage in general leadership work. They can only destroy our living cause.

However, comrades! To timely remove unqualified personnel and timely promote new personnel who are proficient in business, we must improve the situation of the party organization and economic organization in the investigation, selection, and promotion of cadres.

In particular, we must thoroughly improve the work of the deputy people's commissars who manage cadres, because these deputy people's commissars, although they have been working for a long time, are still very weak in their work.

Comrades! Now let's talk about the political departments of railway and water transport.

We must point out that the political departments of railways and water transport must immediately eliminate the phenomenon of being disconnected from local party organizations, and the political departments must report their work to the provincial committees and city committees.

We must directly and openly point out that the work of the political departments of transport, especially the political departments of railway transport, is very unsatisfactory. The work of the political departments is characterized by bureaucratism, and they are busy collecting countless reports from various places and sending a large number of telegrams and documents to replace their own work.

Many political departments have become very bad appendages of the transport management agencies, covering up the shortcomings of the management agencies, and even failing to fulfill the basic responsibility of reminding the party organizations of the shortcomings in transport work.

There are such workers in the political departments who forget their Bolshevik responsibility to the party and the state, living comfortably at the expense of the state, but do nothing to improve the work of transport.

Comrades! In organizational issues, we should also talk about the issue of activists in economic and production work.

We must point out that recently, we have done a poor job in the work of activists. Many people's commissariats have completely ignored this work and do not convene meetings of activists.

This, to a considerable extent, reflects the self-satisfaction of some of our leaders.

These leaders think they know everything and do not need to consult with activists, do not need to consider the experience of lower-level workers, engineers, technical personnel, and Stakhanov workers.

These leaders are afraid to develop criticism and self-criticism.

These leaders forget the teachings of Comrade Stalin.

Everyone remembers that Comrade Stalin expressed gratitude to the participants of the meeting of Stakhanov workers for the help provided by their speeches and suggestions. Comrade Stalin said at this meeting: "Leaders who ignore such practical experience cannot be considered true leaders. Can this be doubted?"

We must re-emphasize the role of activists in economic and production work in enterprises and people's commissariats. Activists must play a major role in this regard, that is, they should fully utilize the experience of lower-level economic workers, party workers, engineers, technical personnel, and Stakhanov workers, and at the same time, explain to industrial workers the significance of various important measures in industry and transport. We must convene meetings of activists from different departments of industry and meetings of activists from various departments of industry and transport. To seriously and solemnly discuss current issues at the meeting of activists, economic leaders and party organizations should make careful preparations for this meeting.

Now let's talk about the socialist competition and the Stakhanov movement. Their significance does not need to be elaborated. I just want to point out that in many of our enterprises, the party organizations and trade unions have unsatisfactory leadership of the socialist competition and the Stakhanov movement.

Due to the formalistic attitude towards the leadership of the Stakhanov movement, there are still such facts in enterprises: more than half of the workers in the entire enterprise are involved in the Stakhanov movement, while at the same time, this enterprise is still dirty, the workshops are full of waste, most workers cannot complete the quota, and even the enterprise has not completed its production plan.

We must vigorously promote the Stakhanov movement, give full play to the creativity of Stakhanov workers, use it to improve labor productivity, solve important problems in production, and improve the production level of backward sections.

Comrades! Now let's talk about the last issue. We must point out that in enterprises, there is still the wrong practice of holding various meetings of social organizations during working hours.

Therefore, in the draft resolution given to everyone, it is proposed that party organizations, Soviet organizations, trade unions, and other social organizations absolutely prohibit:

(1) Holding assemblies and other meetings in enterprises and institutions during working hours;
(2) Calling workers and employees during working hours;
(3) Assigning workers and employees of enterprises and institutions to do temporary work or go on missions to do voluntary assistance, etc.;
(4) During working hours, assigning workers and employees of enterprises and institutions from their direct work to do the work of investigation committees and groups entrusted by social organizations.

We must definitely establish a system where workers and employees of enterprises and institutions can only do the work of social organizations during non-working hours.

To eliminate the shortcomings in the work of industry and transport, the party organization should take the following measures in terms of organizational tasks.

Comrades! Our industry, past and present, is the foundation of the development of the entire national economy. Industry, past and present, is the leading foundation of the entire socialist economic system of our country. Industry leads the entire socialist economy of our country, including agriculture and transport, forward. Industry, past and present, is the foundation of national defense power.

Our task is to continuously push the cause of developing socialist industry forward.

Our industry and transport face new and great tasks in 1941. We must work in such a way that in this year, there will be no backward enterprises in all provinces, cities, and industrial centers.

There should be no backward enterprises in our industry. All factories, mines, and railways should complete the plan.

To strive to complete the plan, to ensure the completion of the plan, to work according to the plan, this means:

(1) We should no longer just complete the annual, quarterly, and monthly production plans on average, but should complete the plans according to the plan and the pre-arranged schedule of finished product production;
(2) We should no longer just complete the plan on average for the entire industrial department, but should make each enterprise complete its own plan;
(3) We should no longer just complete the plan on average for the enterprise, but should make each workshop, each team, each lathe, and each shift complete the plan every day;
(4) We should not only complete the plan according to the quantity indicators, but we must also complete the plan in terms of quality, in sets, and by variety, and it must be in accordance with the specifications and the predetermined cost plan. We should and will be able to further improve our industry and transport in the near future. We must make all party organizations and leaders of our industry and transport immediately overcome the shortcomings in the work of industry and transport with the tenacity of Bolsheviks and fundamentally improve their work in this regard. We cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have made, and we cannot ignore the serious shortcomings in the work of industry and transport. A tolerant attitude towards shortcomings is extremely dangerous and harmful.

The indulgent attitude and self-satisfaction with achievements have already grown and developed in some places, which is unacceptable. Such an attitude will make workers become people who are not strict in demands and indifferent to shortcomings. Such an attitude will disgrace Bolsheviks.

Comrade Stalin teaches us that the characteristic of Bolsheviks should be: uncompromising towards shortcomings, and strict requirements for oneself and one's entire work. (Stormy applause)

Bolsheviks should put the interests of the state and the motherland above everything else. Bolsheviks should be disciplined in the execution of the resolutions of the party and the government. The law is the law of everyone. We are all servants of the state. Comrade Stalin teaches us in this way. (Applause)

Bolsheviks must be real warriors against conservatism in the issues of new technology, new products, and new production methods. We must cultivate the interest of our workers in mastering technology, and we must promote personnel who are proficient in technology. Because without personnel, technology is useless. Bolsheviks, revolutionaries in technology and economics, are people who can break old traditions, establish new traditions, and make continuous progress. Comrade Stalin teaches us in this way. (Applause)

Undoubtedly, our party is strictly implementing the instructions of Comrade Stalin, mobilizing all workers, employees, engineers, and technical personnel to achieve the highest degree of organizational work and the highest possible production efficiency in the work of industry and transport in the shortest possible time. The work of industry and transport will definitely be further improved, and the output of more and better products in various departments will definitely be achieved. Under the strong and wise leadership of Comrade Stalin, our great motherland is marching towards new and decisive victories of communism! (Stormy applause, everyone stands up)

    关于党组织在工业和运输业方面的任务
    ——一九四一年二月十五日在苏联共产党（布）第十八次代表会议上的报告
    格·马·马林科夫
    编者按：马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十八次代表会议上的这个报告，已在中共中央“关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”中列为全党干部的学习文件。这个报告的内容不但对于我们的工业和运输业工作，而且对于我们的整个经济工作和党的各方面工作都有极重要的指导意义。这里发表的报告全文是第一次译成中文的。苏联共产党第十八次代表会议是在一九四一年二月十五日至二十日举行的。马林科夫同志的报告是这次代表会议的第一项议程和主要议程。代表会议根据马林科夫同志的报告，通过了“关于党组织在工业和运输业方面的任务的决议”，这个决议在一九四一年二月二十一日经苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议批准。
    马林科夫同志的报告成了苏联共产党组织在很长一个时期内的战斗纲领。它总结了苏联发展社会主义工业和运输业的经验，论证了领导社会主义经济的列宁斯大林原则，有力地动员了党组织坚决转向工业和运输业方面。马林科夫同志的报告在代表会议上引起了热烈的讨论。发言者一致赞同报告所提出的各个原理，并举了许多例子证明它的批评的正确。代表会议警告大家不要自高自大，自满自足和安于既得的成绩，要求全党不屈不挠地为消灭缺点而斗争，坚持不懈地把发展工业和运输业的事业推向前进。
    苏联共产党第十八次代表会议是在严格的批评和自我批评的精神下进行的。马林科夫同志在报告中所批评的海上运输人民委员、电业人民委员、内河运输人民委员、弹药人民委员、鱼类工业人民委员以及航空工业人民委员、化学工业人民委员，都受到代表会议的警告。代表会议指出：如果他们不改进他们的工作，不完成党和政府给他们的任务，不从第十八次党代表会议对他们工作的批评中获得教训，就将撤消他们的中央委员、中央候补委员、中央监察委员和人民委员的职务。代表会议撤消了四个不能保证执行自己作为中央委员的责任的中央委员和十五个候补中央委员，并将两个中央委员降为候补中央委员。代表会议通过的“关于革新联共（布）中央机关的决议”，指出列宁和斯大林经常教导党要对党和国家的领导人员提出严格的要求，党不应根据他们所发表的言论和宣言，而应根据他们的工作结果来评价他们。正是由于这种严格的要求，这次代表会议保证了党组织的工作的坚决转变，促进了苏联工业和运输业的迅速发展。
    （一）工业和运输业工作中的成绩和缺点
    同志们！党的组织在工业和运输业方面的任务问题要提交代表会议讨论。
    我在关于这一问题的报告中主要是谈工业和运输业工作中的缺点，党组织和各人民委员部在工业和运输业方面的工作的缺点，以及产生这些缺点的原因及其克服的办法。
    同志们，这决不是说我们在工业和运输业的工作中就没有成绩。相反地，在第十八次党代表大会以后的两年间，工业和运输业继续不断地提高了。
    如果说一九三八年的工业总产值为一千零六十八亿三千四百万卢布，那末，一九三九年则为一千二百三十九亿一千五百万卢布，而一九四○年则为一千三百七十五亿卢布。
    可见，我们的工业总产值一年比一年地有了很大的提高。
    我们运输业的工作在过去两年中也有了改进。与一九三八年相比，一九四○年的货物运输量增加如下：铁路运输——百分之一○·三，河运——百分之一二·八，短程海运——百分之一五·一。
    去年一年，苏联的工业和运输业在执行第三个五年计划的工作上有了很大的进步，扩大了生产量和货物运输量，保证了苏联国民经济的进一步发展和国防实力的巩固。掌握新技术方面的成就和国防工业的发展，使我们有了可能以各种最新式的现代化武器来大大加强红军和红海军的技术装备。
    斯大林同志在第十八次党代表大会上说道，为要在经济上超过各主要资本主义国家，首先就要有真诚而奋勇的前进志愿，要有不惜牺牲的决心，即不惜拿出大量的建设投资来竭力扩大我国的社会主义工业。
    在过去两年中，我们曾向工业和运输业投入大量资金，许多新企业已经开工生产了。
    工业和运输业的投资，一九三八年是二百二十三亿四千一百万卢布，一九三九年是二百五十亿三千七百万卢布，一九四○年是二百七十七亿二千八百万卢布。
    我们的党正在不倦地实现斯大林同志关于社会主义工业化的学说。苏联的工业化是我国社会主义发展的规律。
    斯大林同志教导我们说，我们手中必须握有一切，才不会成为资本主义经济的附属物。我们的党遵循这一指示，保证了苏联国民经济的独立性。
    斯大林同志教导我们，必须发展工业，发展经济，以利于社会主义的胜利，以利于社会主义的建设。我们的党遵循这一指示，在我国堵塞了滋生资本主义的一切缝隙。
    苏联现在已经是一个强大的工业化的社会主义大国。
    但是，同志们，与这些成绩同时，我们在工业和运输业工作中还存在着许多严重的缺点。
    我们的全部工业在一九四○年的产量虽然比一九三九年增加了百分之一一，但是，很多工业部门，特别是机车制造业、车厢制造业、电气工业、木材工业、造纸工业、鱼类工业和建筑材料工业还很落后，没有完成生产计划。
    某些人民委员部虽然完成了整个总产值计划，但很多重要产品的计划没有完成。例如纺织工业人民委员部、食品工业人民委员部和轻工业人民委员部就是如此。
    这当然是上述各个人民委员部工作中的严重缺点。对于人民委员部来说，完成计划就是要毫无例外地完成其全部产品计划，而不是只完成那些容易完成的产品计划。
    还有这样的人民委员部，它们不仅没有完成一九四○年的计划，甚至总产值比一九三九年还有些减少。鱼类工业人民委员部、建筑材料工业人民委员部和木材工业人民委员部就属于此例。
    应当坦率地说，这些人民委员部的工作比其他人民委员部做得坏些。
    许多工业部门工作中的一个严重缺点是不及时利用新的生产能力。
    许多工业部门，由于原料、材料、燃料、电力的超支，废品的严重损失及其他浪费现象，以致降低工业产品成本的计划未能完成。石油工业、木材工业、造纸工业和建筑材料工业在降低成本计划方面的执行情况特别恶劣。
    有重大作用的发电站，在一九四○年内努力改进了自己的工作，但是由于技术人员的马虎苟且和不遵守技术操作规程，以致各发电站、特别是电力网仍然大量发生事故。在电业中，这些新技术，如蒸汽的高压和高温的改用，联动操作自动化，以及现代化高速电气保护装置的应用，还没有迅速而充分地加以推广。
    铁路运输业工作中的一个大缺点，就是很多铁路没有完成各种重要货物的运输计划、货车运输计划和每昼夜平均装载计划。在各条铁路线上有很多货车不遵守时间表，客运没有组织好，火车误点的现象仍未消除。
    海运和河运未完成运输计划，特别是矿石、石油、粮食、盐、木料、煤、水泥这些重要产品的运输计划没有完成。由于火车站、港口和码头之间的工作缺乏必要的配合，以致吨位利用不足，车辆长期停歇，各地货运延误。
    工业和运输业工作中的成绩和缺点就是如此。
    （二）人民委员部和党组织在工业和运输业工作中产生缺点的原因
    同志们，很多工业和运输业部门的工作不能令人满意的原因何在呢？
    我们有责任以布尔什维克的坦率精神来揭发这些原因。我们越是真诚地揭发我们的缺点，我们就能越快地克服它。斯大林同志时常这样教导我们。掩饰缺点的人是不能很好地为党服务的。
    工业和运输业的工作之所以不能令人满意，其原因在于人民委员部的领导有缺点，在于省委和市委削弱了自己在工业和运输业方面的工作。
    关于人民委员部，首先应当指出的是：它们对待自己的工作大多抱官僚主义态度，它们还没有深入到每一个别企业中去，它们“领导”自己的企业不是看实质，而是形式地、靠纸上往来。
        人民委员部不能很好地了解各企业的领导干部，不知道企业的工作状况，也不采取有效办法来改正企业工作中的缺点。人民委员部的领导者很少下厂，不亲自帮助工厂改进工作，看来，他们宁愿文牍主义地、只通过一纸公文来进行领导。
    人民委员部工作中的最大缺点，是不检查企业经理对自己决议的执行情况。这样，人民委员部就把自己的领导工作限于委员会的开会和通过决议的范围内，而不懂得决议只是工作的开端；通过决议，并不是为了决议本身，而是为了执行这个决议。它们不懂得领导工作的主要部分，既不在于开会，也不在于通过决议，而在于对这些决议的执行情况进行经常的检查。
    许多指令之所以没有执行，就是因为人民委员部通常只是根据工厂经理和铁路领导人的报告来判断企业的情况，不是有系统地去检查指令执行情况。而企业的经理、铁路领导人则往往从本位观点出发来掩饰缺点和粉饰企业的真实情况。
    在人民委员部里，具体决议的执行往往是无人负责的。
    下面就是说明人民委员部的文牍主义、官僚主义领导方法的几件事实。
    就拿海上运输人民委员部为例。根据经济委员会一九四○年三月七日的决定，杜克利斯基同志应当在一个月期限内向经济委员会作出消除里海船只无人照管现象的计划。这一决定没有按时执行。海上运输人民委员部请求延长期限。经济委员会便把提交计划的日期延到一九四○年五月一日。杜克利斯基同志仍然没有作出计划。一九四○年十月十一日经济委员会建议人民委员杜克利斯基同志赶快作出关于消除里海船只无人照管现象的计划。杜克利斯基同志在经济委员会寄来的信上加了简短的批语：“列索维科夫同志（该部副人民委员），沃龙诺夫同志（计划处处长），计划草案呢？”人民委员的这个问题一直虚悬了两个多月。直到十二月三十一日，计划处工作人员金兹布尔格同志才给列索维科夫同志交了一个计划草案。一九四一年一月二日，列索维科夫同志才把这一材料转交给技术管理处处长契霍夫斯基同志，而契霍夫斯基同志却把这一草案积压到一九四一年一月十六日，然后才把这一草案交回给金兹布尔格同志。最后，一九四一年一月二十五日，即经济委员会作出决议后已过去十个半月，杜克利斯基同志才把关于消除里海船只无人照管现象的计划交给经济委员会。
    试问杜克利斯基同志，如果海上运输人民委员部拟定消除里海船只无人照管现象的计划就需要十个半月，那末，消除里海船只无人照管现象又需要多少时间呢？况且，还不知道这是一个什么计划！
    下面是电业人民委员部工作中的一件事实。一九四○年十月二十九日电业人民委员部接到一件指示，要哈尔科夫电机工厂在一九四○年十一月十日以前给造船工业人民委员部供应设备。人民委员保加蒂列夫同志在接到的公文上批了一下：“转军事处处长克拉夫佐夫同志：请立即按此决定于十月三十日拟定命令。”命令拟了五天，到十一月六日才送到该人民委员部的电机工业总管理局。该局总工程师卢波同志十一月十日才把这一紧急命令送给该局生产处处长阿尔则莫夫同志，并批示：“请下命令。”阿尔则莫夫同志给该局调度员克拉夫楚克同志写道：“请遵令照办。”而克拉夫楚克同志却在十一月十日，即设备应该送到等待着它的工厂去的那一天，在上面批了“归卷”，即归档。重要任务的执行就这样被断送了。
    所有这些——“拟定命令”、“下命令”、“遵令照办”及最后“归卷”——难道不是电业人民委员部的工作人员以官僚架子、官僚主义态度对待活生生的事情的证明吗？如果人民委员部对执行情况进行了初步的检查，难道会有这类事情发生吗？
    就拿内河运输人民委员部来说。该部委员会在一九四○年内召开了六十二次会议，听取了一百零二个问题的报告，但委员会本身作出决议而得到通过的只有七个问题。对其余问题的决议的制定，则交给了专门委员会。而专门委员会对大部分问题的草拟工作，一直拖延了好几个月，因为人民委员部没有人去检查委托的任务。例如，由人民委员沙什科夫同志担任主席的专门委员会，对“关于劳动指标和财政指标执行情况总结”问题的决议，就草拟了整整半年，即从八月二十日起直到今天。
    在这样的工作秩序之下，是会戕害任何活生生的事情的。所以，内河运输人民委员部的货运成绩很坏，是不足为奇的。
    关于弹药人民委员部我想谈几句话。该部有下面这样的事实。人民委员谢尔格也夫同志在其二○三号命令中，曾建议一七六号工厂经理“在四号车间内设立磷酸盐制造班，安装药槽并开工生产。执行期限为一九四○年六月八日”。命令在六月五日签署，六月七日才颁发出去，而命令中规定的工作执行期限，像我们知道的，是在六月八日。再拿一八九号命令来说。根据这个命令，一四四号工厂应“于一九四○年六月一日以前拟出车间六月份（应把补偿四、五月份未完成的工作计算在内）的工作指示图表”。这一命令是在五月三十一日签署的，自然，当它下达工厂时已是在规定完成任务的日期之后了。再看第三件事实。一五一号命令指出了工厂技术保安的不良状况。按第八点规定，执行者应于四月二十九日把工作计划送谢尔格也夫同志批准，但命令本身是在五月四日签署的。
    难道这是严肃的工作态度吗？给下面布置任务应当加以周密考虑。然而，上面所列举的命令却只能是违犯纪律的。
    官僚主义、办事迟缓和不检查执行情况的例子，还可以举出很多来。可惜，每一个人民委员部都有这样的例子，而较为认真地每天都来监督企业工作的例子却是没有的。其实，每天认真地监督工厂的工作，是各人民委员部的一种最重要的责任。
    必须使人民委员部结束领导企业的文牍主义官僚主义方法，必须抛弃这一切文牍主义而代之以认真地从事决议执行情况的检查和对本企业工作的监督。
    人民委员部领导工作中的缺点就是如此。
    现在来谈谈党组织在工业和运输业方面的工作缺点。
    这方面的主要缺点是党组织没有帮助人民委员部和本省、市、区的企业。
    党组织无论在工业方面或运输业方面都削弱了自己的工作，并错误地认为自己对工业和运输业的工作可以不负责任。
    地方党组织也像经济组织一样，不懂得检查执行情况的意义和作用，因而没有帮助人民委员部和总管理局改善所属企业的经理对执行人民委员部的决议情况的经常检查。
    许多省委会忙于农业和收购农产品的工作，却把工业和运输业的工作丢在一边，忘记了自己对本省、市、区的工厂、矿山、矿井和铁路的工作应负的责任。应当把自己的主要注意力放在工业和运输业方面的市委会，并没有管这件事情，也不设法改善落后企业和铁路的工作。
    市委会和省委会不深入到工厂和铁路的工作中去，往往对工业和运输业的工作不闻不问，不监督企业的工作，不检查工厂和铁路的领导人的工作情况，不揭发他们工作中的缺点，从而也就纵容了这些缺点。
    市委会和省委会对于它们的许多企业长期远未完成计划的情形安之若素，也不采取有效办法来消除这种可耻现象。
    举土拉省为例。土拉省的同志们，你们的这些工厂如新土拉冶金厂、斯大林诺果尔斯克联合工厂以及其他一些大企业，最近四年来对生产计划的完成没有超过百分之六○至八○。
    在齐略宾斯克省，像齐略宾斯克拖拉机工厂和齐略宾斯克炼锌厂这样一些工厂，在最近
    四年当中生产计划经常有百分之一五——二○不能完成。
    再看看奥勒尔省。该省像“红色职工国际”这样的大企业，在一九三八年完成计划百分之六六，一九三九年——百分之六三，一九四○年——百分之七五。
    阿尔汉格尔斯克省的沙龙巴尔斯克纸浆工厂、拉尔斯克造纸厂和省内许多大木材厂在最近三年中仅完成计划的百分之四○至八○。
    巴什基里亚自治共和国的别洛列茨克冶金工厂在一九三八年完成计划百分之七七，一九三九年完成百分之七一，一九四○年完成百分之八六。
    工厂一贯落后的事实，在所有其他省、边区和共和国中也可以找出许多。
    要晓得，省委会和市委会对所有的这些工厂是要管的，或者更确切些说，是应当管的。然而结果，正如大家所看见的，却是这样：这些和诸如此类的工厂已经多年来指靠着国家的供养。
    市委会和省委会没有很好管直属加盟共和国人民委员部的企业和工业建筑工程，错误地认为只有人民委员部才应当对这些企业和建筑工程的工作情况负责。
    许多省，由于自己的工作不好而决定地影响了某些重要产品的总计划未能完成。
    斯大林诺省、查坡洛什省和斯维尔德洛夫斯克省的企业在炼铁方面的工作特别坏。
    伏罗希洛夫格勒省、齐略宾斯克省、斯维尔德洛夫斯克省和莫洛托夫省的煤炭工业的企业阻延了煤炭工业的发展。
    切切诺—英古什克自治共和国的格罗兹内石油企业、克拉斯诺达尔边区的马依科普石油企业、巴什基里亚自治共和国和伯力边区的企业在开采石油方面的工作特别坏。
    机车生产落后的现象是哈尔科夫市、奥尔忠尼启则格勒市和乌兰乌德市的机车制造企业工作不良的结果。伏罗希洛夫格勒工厂和科洛明工厂的工作也做得不好。
    伊万诺沃省和加里宁省的企业，特别是雅罗斯拉夫里省的企业的工作不好，对于棉织品计划的不能完成有决定的影响。
    很多集中有大企业的工业城市没有完成生产计划。例如，一九四○年高尔基市完成了总产值计划的百分之九三·六，第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克市完成了百分之九五·八，斯大林格勒市完成了百分之九五·八，加里宁市完成了百分之九三·七，齐略宾斯克市完成了百分之九○·二，土拉市完成了百分之八五·一，雅罗斯拉夫里市完成了百分之七九·九，斯大林诺市完成了百分之九○·三。
    要知道，在这些城市中，市委会的首要职责就是保证工业工作的顺利完成。
    市委会和省委会工作中的一个重大的缺点，在于它们不深入了解企业工作的本质，不研究企业的经济，而常常只满足于皮相的考察和肤浅的决定。
    同志们，还有这样的事实：我们有许多的省委会和市委会认为自己在工业和运输业方面的责任，就只是在省委会的常委会上听取企业经理的报告。往往是根据这些报告作出一些很不具体因而对企业很少用处的决议。而且，对这些决议的执行情况，照例是不加以检查的。
    还应指出另一种情形：省委会和市委会要等到个别企业已经明显地发生破坏计划的情事时，才动手管它们。而事先是谁也想不到去帮助工厂或铁路的。
    必须消除对工业企业和运输业企业的这种粗率的工作态度。
    市委会和省委会必须和人民委员部一起把市和省的一切工业企业和运输业企业的工作担负起来。正是市委会和省委会才可能就地直接地、最客观地、不从狭隘的本位利益出发来分析企业的工作状况，找出工作中的缺点，帮助企业和人民委员部的领导者消灭这些缺点。
    同志们，这就是许多工业部门的工作之所以不能令人满意的原因，这就是工业和运输业工作中产生缺点的原因。
    （三）党组织在工业和运输业方面的经济、政治任务
    为了消除工业和运输业工作中的缺点，应该对党组织提出什么要求呢？
    为此，首先必须无条件地消除党组织对工业和运输业状况所采取的漠不关心的态度，必须坚决转移党组织的注意力，最大限度地关怀工业和运输业的需要和利益。
    党组织应当经常钻研工业企业和铁路的工作，了解它们的需要，并帮助经济部门对工业和运输业的经常工作的领导。
    直到现在，党组织仍把主要注意力放在对农业的领导方面。这样作在粮食问题没有解决以前是正确的。但是现在，当粮食问题和每年收获谷物七十亿至八十亿普特的任务已基本解决时，就必须使党组织转向工业和运输业方面。这并不是说要削弱对农业的注意力。而是说党组织已经成长到可以同等地致力于工业和农业了。
    各党组织的一个最重要而刻不容缓的任务，是消除它们在工业和运输业方面工作中的缺点。
    党组织必须帮助人民委员部和各企业整顿工厂、矿山、铁路、港口和码头的秩序。为此必须具体地从每一个企业着手。党组织在发掘新的潜力以改善和发展工业和运输业的工作中，应当表现出最大的主动性。
    其次，党组织必须帮助人民委员部和总管理局检查各企业经理的工作，检查各企业执行人民委员部的决议的情况。
    党的领导者必须懂得：根本改善党组织对工业和运输业方面的决议执行情况的检查工作，是十分必要的。党组织应当懂得，仅仅人民委员部是不能够监督企业的工作和检查人民委员部的决议的执行情况的。因此，党组织应当帮助人民委员部检查各企业对人民委员部的指示的执行情况，即监督各企业经理的工作。
    只有在这种条件下，才可能保证每个企业和每条铁路经常完成国家计划，从而使工业和运输业向前发展。
    为了消除工业和运输业工作中的缺点，党组织还必须采取哪些办法呢？
    关于企业中的设备和各种财产和材料的统计。要从这个问题开始，是因为许多人忘记了：缺乏对设备、财产和材料的正确统计，就不能管理企业。一个企业经理，如果想真正掌握企业，而不是盲目地、靠侥幸来进行工作，他就应当很好地了解工厂的全部资产，应当知道工厂的设备、工具、原料、材料在那里和有多少。
    但是，正如许多事实所表明的，各个企业的设备统计，材料、原料的统计，甚至成品统计都很难令人满意。企业的领导者容许在统计工作方面有大量冗员，而关于企业资源却没有掌握起码材料。
    下面就是一件典型事实。有色金属冶炼工业人民委员部科尔楚金工厂的经理彼得罗夫同志想知道：二号车间在一九四一年一月七日未完成的生产有多少。工厂的会计告诉他有八一·六吨，计划科说有四七·七吨，根据车间的登记册有五一·五吨，检查结果实际只有一一吨。（全场活跃）同志们，你们想想根据这样的统计，经理怎能进行工作。
    在目前统计工作的状况下，产生下面这样的事情是毫不奇怪的。卡斯普丹凯拉号轮船在一九四○年的九个月内多耗费了一万二千五百吨燃料，而人民委员部却给它计算节省出二百万卢布的燃料。请看海上运输人民委员部里有什么样的秩序。他们既要多烧煤，又要享受节约模范的光荣称号。（全场活跃）
    企业统计工作无人照管的结果，必然会造成过多的材料储备，采购过多的照例是不成套的备用品，增加未完成的生产和大量积压国家资财。
    根据中央国民经济统计局的统计，截至一九四○年十二月一日为止，在十二个工业人民委员部所管辖的企业中，贵重商品物资的储存量超过定额二十六亿一千万卢布。
    不好的统计工作，会使企业、建筑工程和铁路上许多极贵重的机床、机器和发动机不能得到利用。常常有这样的情形：当接受新任务时，经理就要求增添材料、机床和设备，其中还包括进口货。其实，在企业里所有这些东西都是很充足的。而人民委员部不了解企业工作的真实情况，也不审查企业所提出的申请和要求，照例是盖章批准。
    那个企业里的统计工作有丝毫不正常，那里的工作就会有各种意料不到的事情发生。在这样的企业里，必然会因为领导人意料不到地缺乏某种原料、材料、半成品和工具而破坏生产。同时，资材不足的现象常常是要在需要这些材料和必须交付成品的时候才能发现的。
    任务在于消除我国企业和铁路系统中统计工作无人照管的现象。
    必须使工业企业和铁路对设备、各种财产和材料都有正确的统计工作。
    关于设备、工具、原料和材料的利用。显然，同志们，对设备、工具、材料、原料和燃料的正确利用，决定着企业的生产成绩。
    然而，我国工业企业设备的生产能力，远没有充分加以利用，在许多企业里工具无人照管，材料、原料和燃料的消耗也多浪费。有些企业把很多车床和其他设备停着不用，有时干脆摆在这些企业的仓库里，可是其他企业却迫切需要这种设备。
    根据中央国民经济统计局按八个工业人民委员部的统计（这些统计是极不完全的），截至一九四○年十一月一日为止，各企业中有三万三千台金属切削机床没有安装，因而也没有进行生产。此外，在这八个人民委员部的企业中有六千种冶炼设备和锻压设备单位没有安装，因而也就没有动工。
    根据中央国民经济统计局的同一材料，在我国七千六百二十九个企业中有十七万台电动机（总能力二百万瓩）和四千五百二十二台发电机（总发电能力三十四万瓩）没有安装。
    同志们，难道还能继续容忍这种惊人的不经济现象吗？
    我们企业在利用生产能力上如何难于令人容忍，还可以拿水泥工业和木材工业的例子来说明。
    水泥工业的生产能力正在逐年提高。所有水泥工厂的生产能力一九三六年为六百七十万一千吨，一九三七年为七百零二万四千吨，一九三八年为七百六十万四千吨，一九三九年为七百九十七万六千吨，一九四○年为八百二十万六千吨。
    可是，这几年来这些生产能力的利用却不断地减少了。例如，一九三六年各水泥工厂的生产能力利用率为百分之八八，这已是很坏的了，而一九三七年这些生产能力却利用得还要差，只达百分之七七，一九三八年——百分之七五，一九三九年——百分之六五，而一九四○年——只百分之六四。
    同志们，要晓得水泥在我国基本建设中的作用并不是很小的。
    就拿木材工业来说。截至一九三九年一月一日为止，苏联木材工业人民委员部锯木的总生产能力能够锯木三千一百五十万立方公尺，而实际上，一九四○年只锯了一千三百万立方公尺的木料，只占木材工业锯木生产能力的百分之四一。
    要晓得木材对我国的工业和运输业也是非常需要的。
    经常有这样的情形，一些稀有的完善设备、复杂的生产联动机和重型车床没有根据它的用途来加以利用，或是利用得不充分。用这种稀有的完善设备去作一些简单的操作，或者制造一些本来用较简单的小型设备就可以制造的小零件。
    也时常有用立式车床来制造茶盘大小的零件的情形。
    这种对设备不切实的利用降低了我国企业的实际生产可能性，并给整个国民经济带来极大的损失。
    利用工具的情形也很坏。各企业利用工具很不得当。贵重工具没有根据其用途来加以使用。用过了的工具常常被当成废物，其实，它是可以修理起来重新利用的。
    至于说到材料、原料和燃料，那末我们对这些东西的浪费简直是罪过。由于铸件和锻件的加工余量过多，许多金属都被削为切屑。而切屑，其中也包括稀有金属的切屑，又没有加以充分利用。许多材料由于在截切和铸型工作上的不适当和不节约而被蹧蹋了。由于辗铁生产的种类不够广，以致金属消耗过多。到目前为止，我国企业和铁路多烧的燃料和多用的电力数量是很大的。有的地方滥用液体燃料，在那里本来可能以固体燃料来代用，但没有。任务在于消除利用设备的不经济现象，消除对工具、原料、材料、燃料和电力的浪费，消除我国工业和运输业中对生产能力不加充分利用的状况。
    必须使我国的工业企业和铁路能够充分而正确地利用设备，节省地使用工具、原料、材料、燃料和电力。
    关于保护企业中的国家财产。注意保护国家财产——建筑物、房舍、设备、工具和一切托交企业的贵重物资，是我国工厂、铁路和水上运输的领导者、工程师、工人和职员的头等责任。企业的许多工作人员不懂得这一点，因而对人民财富处处都表现出漠不关心的和非主人翁的态度。
    我国工业所迫切需要的设备、原料、材料、工具在许多企业中到处乱扔，任其破坏、生锈而成为废物。
    同志们，你们可以在自己的省和市的企业中找到许多这样的事实。
    在这方面我可以帮助沃龙涅什省的同志们。
    一九四一年一月十四日在里彼茨克市六一号工厂里，从露天雪下的废物中偶然发现了七十架有用的机床。要知道在这个工厂里有经理、有党组织，最后在里彼茨克还有市委会。他们究竟在管些什么？对保护设备谈得上关心吗？
    这难道不是对国家财富的罪恶态度吗？
    在我国企业中对自己的机床和工具粗心大意和不加爱护是很普遍的现象，这已用不着说了。要知道，不好好照管机床和工具，不及时修好房舍设备，就会使它们过早损坏和不能使用，这是很显然的。
    在运输业中，车辆修理工作无人照管和对铁路、水路的不小心保养，是发生事故的重大原因。
    任务在于消除这种对人民财富采取反国家态度的表现。
    必须留心保护工业企业和运输业中的一切贵重物资并把它们很好地安置起来，必须使企业的领导者爱护托付给他的国家财产（房舍、设备、工具、材料）。
    关于禁止企业出卖设备和材料。同志们，日前关于这个问题颁布了一个指令。为什么要颁布这个指令呢？因为在我们企业中还有出卖和与其他企业交换设备和材料的浪费行为。国家为了一定的目的给企业供应设备和材料，而企业的领导者却随意地和非法地处理这些东西，把它们出卖、交换和转售出去了。
    同志们，在你们省、市的许多企业里，同样也可以发现出卖、浪费国家财产的事实。
    例如，在顿巴斯的斯大林诺市，冶金工厂一九四○年曾把价值五十多万卢布的各种工厂材料非法地转售给刻尔松纺织工厂、斯大林食品商店和戏院。
    请问，谁允许该工厂的经理这样处理托付给他的国家财产？
    再看看，鄂木斯克铁路有出卖瓦垅铁、钉子、干油、圆木和其他材料的事实。
    鄂木斯克铁路的领导人有什么权利这样做呢？
    斯维尔德洛夫斯克省中部乌拉尔炼铜工厂在一九四○年把水道用附具卖给“有色金属供应处”，价值十万卢布。但是，就在这里闹了一个笑话。当经理把附具卖掉时，该厂的所谓负责执行人正为该厂寻找各种材料和设备。在找寻当中，他偶然走到“有色金属供应处”的仓库去，看见那里有他所适用的水道用附具。负责执行人不知这一附具就是刚从他的工厂卖出来的，于是花了十一万一千卢布把它买下运回工厂去了。（笑声）
    同志们，这个工厂里的秩序怎样，就可想而知了。老实说，依了这样的所谓“业务”，经理是要破产的，但是，因为我们的人民委员部照例把一切这类大蠢事算在公家的账上，所以，经理也就安然自得。不仅如此，甚且这位经理因为卖得成功，而负责的执行者因为买得成功而得了奖励。（全场大笑）
    查波洛什铁合金工厂把焦煤和矽铁渣转让给“国营棉织工业总管理局”所属的奥列哈沃·祖也沃机械工厂。为交换这些材料，奥列哈沃·祖也沃机械工厂把布匹转让给查波洛什铁合金工厂。“特种钢总管理局”局长舍烈梅特也夫同志关于这一点在工厂经理菲拉托夫同志的申请书上批道：“同意，但这是不对的。今后要禁止。”（笑声）
    据说，工厂领导者受这一批示的鼓励，不久重又干起各种交换的业务来了。
    同志们，直率地说，这种出卖所谓拆除的和多余的设备和材料的事实，无非是盗窃社会主义财产的行为。
    任务在于严格执行一九四一年二月十日苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁布的“关于禁止出卖、交换和转让设备和材料以及对这种非法行为的法律处分”的法令。
    必须消除许多企业和铁路中的这种出卖所谓拆除的和多余的设备和材料的事实，因为这无非是一种盗窃社会主义财产的行为。
    关于企业和铁路的清洁和秩序。我想，清洁是现代化企业进行正常工作的最起码条件，这是大家都很清楚的。
    不照管设备，不使设备保持必要的清洁和秩序，会使设备经常发生故障。凡不清洁和无秩序的地方，那里就必然会发生事故和闯出祸来。用肮脏的长久失修的设备工作和使用不管用的工具，就会造成许多废品。
    肮脏——是工厂中松懈散漫、破坏纪律、不守规则、缺少秩序的必然伴侣和来源。
    支配着许多企业的无文化和废物堆积的现象，妨碍着去组织工人、领班和工程师的劳动，妨碍着他们有成效地利用劳动时间。所有这一切都会使企业生产能力降低，产品减少，质量变坏。
    同时，我们许多企业、车间、工厂庭院、车库、铁路工厂、发电站、车站、海港和内河码头都是一片肮脏，工作地点、设备、工具和原料都污秽凌乱。机床旁和过道里乱扔废铁和切屑。车间的窗户和玻璃房顶布满灰尘而缺乏光线。
    给大家举一个例子。有这样一个全国闻名的马格尼托果尔斯克工厂。这个厂的车间里到处堆积废物。特别是马丁炉车间和轧钢车间。据说，在十二号马丁炉后面堆积了一大堆各种各样的废物，运走这些废物要用许多空车厢。在第一马丁炉车间和第二马丁炉车间之间的走廊上存在着一块所谓纠纷地带，就是说，不论那一车间都不承认这块地方是自己的。马格尼托果尔斯克工厂如何解决这一纠纷的呢？原来，是在为了“便利”两个车间的情况下解决的。两个车间都把垃圾堆在这个地方，谁也不去清除。看来，在这个代表会议上马格尼托果尔斯克的同志们是要解决这两个车间的纠纷了，因为市委会在代表会议前一直懒得理会这件事情。据说，马格尼托果尔斯克市委会的领导人到车间去过，而且似乎他们要花不少的气力爬上烂铁堆碰到各种废物和垃圾，才能钻进车间。
    为肮脏和废物堆积是马格尼托果尔斯克这样具有头等设备的工厂的必然伴侣，马格尼托果尔斯克的人是否不认为丢脸呢？
    再看看依万诺沃省有色金属冶炼业人民委员部的科尔楚金工厂，关于这个工厂前面已经谈到过。在这个工厂里，由于车间的污秽和废物堆积，经常有无关的金属和粘在金属上的脏东西掉到轧制品里。这种废品在工厂里甚至被取了一个特别的名号，叫“轧肮脏”。仅在一九四○年十一月间，四号车间造成了八百七十次废品，其中就有一百三十六次是所谓“轧肮脏”的废品。这个车间在一年内因废品带来的损失就超过三十万卢布。
    科尔楚金的人有什么权利把苏维埃工厂弄得这样肮脏呢？
    就拿莫斯科的沙维洛夫车站来说。这个车站处于无人照管和不文明的状况中。天花板上因漏水而盖满了肮脏的污渍和霉菌。化冰水从窗子上流下地板。食堂的桌布很脏。车站大厦里修一个小房间，把整个车站的走道都弄得肮脏不堪。城郊售票处大厅的地板很污秽和到处是香烟头。
    难道还能继续忍受这种无文化的现象吗？工厂经理、车库主任和车站站长都应使自己的企业讲究清洁并经常保持清洁。对所有这一切不成体统的事情应当向他们、向经理们追究责任。经理要负责任，同时他还应当要求车间主任。难道不能建立一种轮班值日制，一班接一班地来监督车间的清洁卫生吗？
    我们工厂、矿山、车库、车站、港口上废物堆积和污秽现象是再也不能容忍了。企业中的无文化现象是结束的时候了。对人民的财产采取玩忽的和不经济的态度会给国家带来巨大的损失。
    列宁不止一次地痛斥了不善经营、松懈、污秽和无文化的现象。列宁说，不向这种资本主义传统的保存者开仗，我们就不能履行自己的义务。列宁强调说：“只要我们对这样的工厂保持沉默和采取容忍态度，我们就不是共产党员，而是懦夫。”
    企业和铁路必须讲究和天天保持清洁和起码的秩序。
    我们应该立即解决生产中保持清洁和文化的任务，这是最简单而基本的任务，同时是刻不容缓的任务，因为没有起码的文化就不能胜利地完成进一步提高我国工业的任务，就不能解决我国所面临的与由社会主义过渡到共产主义有关的伟大任务。
    苏联的工厂应该是培养清洁习惯和保持秩序的温床。
    关于企业完成生产计划的指示图表。同志们！现在的情形是这样的：大多数企业生产成品很不均衡，时多时少，而且照例集中到月底。在企业内缺少预先编制好的精确的成品生产指示图表。
    给大家举出几个典型例子。
    莫斯科省科洛明机器制造厂一九四○年的生产情况如下：每月上旬生产量百分之五—七，中旬——百分之一○—一五，而在下旬——百分之七五—八○。
    列宁格勒的卡尔·马克思工厂在一九四○年十二月上旬生产占月份产量的百分之二，中旬——百分之八，而在下旬——百分之九○。
    莫斯科水泵—压缩机制造厂在一九四○年十二月上旬完成月度计划的百分之三·四，中旬——百分之二七·五，下旬——百分之六九·一。
    大多数的企业都有这种情形。生产成品的车间即装配车间从其他车间领到半成品是断断续续的、不均衡的。企业在工作上没有正常的准备量，因而照例要在上半月把企业的全部力量放在建立准备量上。
    这种不正确的工作制度会造成经常的紧张状态，设备的停工和劳动力的停歇，生产能力的不能充分利用，废品的增加以及额外工作的非生产开支。这种不正确的制度使企业处于时紧时松的状态，并使其时时都有完不成国家计划的危险。
    必须结束无计划性，结束出产的不均衡现象和企业工作中的突击倾向，使每个工厂、矿坑和铁路每天按预先编制好的指示图表完成生产计划。
    在某些人民委员部里正在实行一种良好的制度，它规定工厂经理每天要向人民委员报告前一天的产量。这种日报表只指明一项数目，但它可以监督工厂每日的工作。根据这些日报表可以看出，哪些工厂是不按照规定的产品指示图表进行生产的。这些报告表责成人民委员及时查明不能完成每日任务的原因，并及时设法纠正已发现的缺点。
    这种日报制在已实行的地方，都已对工厂的工作起着巨大的监督作用。以前那些把大多数产品量推到月底来完成的工厂，现在大部分都开始按照指示图表进行生产，每日按规定数量出产成品了。
    同志们！难道不能在我们所有人民委员部里都推行这种制度，不能对企业的工作实行每日的监督吗？要晓得，规定出一种制度使人民委员一早上班就得到工厂前一日的出产量的简明表报，这是完全可以做得到的。
    关于技术操作纪律。我们企业工作中最大的缺点就是：技术操作纪律的松懈，缺乏详细制定的生产技术操作规程，任意违反已制定的蓝图以及不经预先仔细试验就不负责任地改变制品结构。在许多工厂内还有随意破坏规定的生产技术操作制度，改变加工制造方法以及不遵守规定的制品公差的情形。
    工厂经理、总工程师和总工艺工程师没有好好监督技术操作规程的执行，不注意精确地按图作业，并且把批准技术资料和蓝图这样极为重要的工作推托给次要的工作人员。
    正因为如此，技术操作过程所据以进行的技术资料和蓝图就常常搞得十分紊乱，而技术资料上所规定的生产技术操作过程，与它在工作地点的实施是脱节的。
    对遵守技术操作规程、精确按照蓝图和制品结构进行工作的这种轻率态度，造成在成批生产中产品质量的各不相同，所得到的机器和机械的标准零件不能互换。任意改变技术操作和随意作图，常常会出产劣品，会使设备增添许多不必要的工作。
    正因为缺乏技术操作纪律，所以在我们许多工业企业中仍然在继续出产不合规格的劣等的和不成套的产品。苏联最高苏维埃主席团一九四○年七月十日“关于工业企业出产劣等的或不成套的产品、不遵守一定规格的责任问题”的指示，虽然已经起了作用，但是在争取提高产品质量方面，我们还有很多缺点。许多经济工作领导者对于出产劣等产品、对于废品制造者损坏大量贵重物资的事实采取罪恶的漠视态度。废品制造者竟可以不负他们造成废品的物质上的责任。出产劣等原料和造成许多废品，会破坏生产计划的完成，扰乱我们企业的正常工作和大大提高产品成本。在许多企业里没有建立及时而有效的监督，以预防废品的可能发生。同志们！是结束违反技术操作规程的时候了。必须在一切企业中实行精确的技术操作规程，并且建立遵守这些规程的检查制度。人民委员部应当保证在企业里有遵守生产技术操作的严格纪律，禁止企业未经人民委员部的许可就擅自改变规定在大批及成批生产中的技术操作法，改变某种生产的制品结构和图样。
    我们企业和人民委员部的工作人员应该懂得，现在已经不能按旧方式、疲疲沓沓、马马虎虎、凭目力观测地工作了。我们企业所装备的新的精确的机械设备，要求我们在生产中建立最严格的制度，要求我们的全部工作都建立在准确遵守技术规则和规程的基础上。
    技术操作纪律的实质，在于使我们的工人、领班和工程师学会准确而毫无差错地照样进行技术操作工序，以及按照技术条件和标准的要求出产确切的相同的产品。
    我们的每一个工业企业都应当出产品质优良的产品，高高地保持本厂名牌的荣誉。
    同志们！必须使我们的企业遵守技术操作过程的严格纪律，在一切企业内实行精确的技术操作规程，监督这些规程的遵守，从而保证出产完全合乎规格的品质优良和成套的产品。
    新技术问题。许多工业企业和运输业企业的领导者对新技术的意义估计不足，他们没有进一步去改进新技术，掌握新的机器、材料和制品的生产。有价值的发明和新的改进方法，往往长年累月地停留在科学研究所、实验室和企业里，而未被在生产中加以利用。
    许多人民委员部的技术委员会变成了解决小技术问题的辅助机关，没有认真地研究新技术的应用问题。
    某些企业领导者为贪图自己的便利，宁愿长期生产同一种类的旧产品，长期采用旧的生产方法，而不顾技术的发展。
    各种新产品的计划和设计工作以及掌握这些新产品的成批生产都进行得很缓慢，要费很长时间。因而常常发生这样的情况，当开始成批制造新产品时，这种产品早已非先进的了。
    许多天才的设计师未能得到人民委员部和企业领导者方面的必要支持，因此，他们白费了不少的力气和精力。然而，经验证明，如果交给我们设计师的是解决某种问题的具体工作，那末，他们是能够胜任他们所担负的任务的。
    先进的生产方法，先进企业、车间、优秀斯大哈诺夫工作者和生产革新者的经验的推广很慢，而且甚至在很多场合下被忽视了。
    部分企业领导人的这种保守主义，妨碍着生产的进一步发展，使企业安于落后和得过且过，并且破坏国防实力。
    必须铲除对新技术所抱的尾巴主义即彻头彻尾的机会主义的态度。
    任务在于使企业的领导人、设计师、科学研究所和实验室工作人员，工程师、技师、领班、先进工人等经常不断地改进技术，掌握新的机器、材料和制品的生产。
    我们工业和运输业的工作人员必须充分利用社会主义制度的巨大可能性，以发展技术思想以及尽快应用新技术成就于生产之中。必须特别注意新技术问题，不断改善技术，掌握新的机器、材料和制品的生产。
    关于产品成本。同志们！许多事实表明，工业企业和运输业企业的领导者不以主人翁态度来计算、估价和节约人民的戈比。
    由于燃料的过量消耗，原料的非生产开支，贵重材料的大量耗用以及电力的浪费，使我们的企业遭受重大损失。管理经济的这种浪费行为是反人民的。它与我们社会主义经济毫无共同之处。社会主义经济对于每一戈比、每一公斤燃料和原料、每一架联动机和车床，都是要严格地计算和加以有效地利用的。    
    许多企业的领导者习惯于一切坐享其成，忘记了经济核算制，安于破坏财政制度和不善经营的状况，并对国家为补偿他们经营不当所造成的物质损失的开支采取无关痛痒的态度。
    产品成本是说明企业全部工作质量的基本指标。为要正确地领导企业工作，必须知道每一单位产品在其成本主要构成部分即工资、原料、燃料和电力的价值、折旧费、行政管理费等方面的实际开支，并使企业的经济工作能保证无条件地完成成本计划和赢利计划。
    任务在于消灭不善经营的状况，要精通企业的经济业务，最大限度地利用企业的内部资源。
    必须有系统地减低产品成本，设法巩固经济核算制，彻底消除一切浪费现象。
    工资问题。同志们！正确制定工资，是提高生产的最重要条件。促使劳动者从物质上关心劳动成果的原则，是我们全部工资政策中的指导原则。为实现这一原则，我们采取了对工人实行计件工资制、对领导工作人员实行奖金制的形式，以及采取了对熟练劳动与非熟练劳动比较的奖励制的形式。
    计件工资和奖金制度是提高劳动生产率，因之也是发展我们整个国民经济的最重要的杠杆。
    实际上，在工资方面这一指导原则常常遭到破坏。
    时常有这样腐败的情形：奖励了一些优秀工作者以后，便也把那类在劳动生产率上落后、不提高业务和不完成生产定额的工人的工资有意地提高到他们的工资水平。
    不久前，在煤炭工业中有过地下工人所得工资少于地面工人的工资的情形，这种情形或许现在在某些煤矿中还存在着。
    正因为在制定工资方面存在这些缺点，所以至今在我们企业中还有不少工人不能完成生产定额。很多企业领导者和领班竟容忍这种情况，他们在工资方面提倡平均主义从而阻碍了劳动生产率的进一步提高。甚至当采用新技术和组织、经济措施迫切要求提高生产定额时，企业的领导者和领班也常常加以拒绝。
    任务在于奖励优秀工作人员，彻底消灭工资方面平均主义的腐败现象。企业领导者、车间主任和领班应当随着先进技术的应用和组织、经济措施的实行而提高生产定额。
    同志们！必须在工资方面严格和彻底地贯彻物质上奖励优秀工作人员的原则，这一原则是以对工人的计件工资制、对领导工作人员的奖金制、对熟练劳动与非熟练劳动比较的奖励工资制的形式来实现的。
    关于旷工和随意离开工作岗位。苏联最高苏维埃主席团一九四○年六月二十六日“关于改为八小时工作日和七天一工作周，关于禁止工人和职员擅自离开企业和机关”的指令之实施，大大地改进了企业的劳动纪律的状况。
    但是，同志们！在许多工厂、矿山、矿坑以及铁路上还存在着旷工现象。企业的经济组织、党组织、工会和青年团的一部分领导者没有很好进行巩固劳动纪律的工作。这些领导者把反对劳动力流动性和旷工现象的斗争任务了解为短时期的运动，并且忘记了旷工和随意离开工作是极其有害于国家，是会阻碍完成生产计划及缩减工业品出产量的。旷工，这是生产的灾害。
    同志们！必须彻底消灭旷工现象。
    关于企业的一长制。尽管有党的明确指示，许多企业至今仍未能在企业管理方面实行真正的一长制。经理的命令往往未被执行。而企业经理本人也没有利用自己的职权，而常常把事情推给社会组织。
    企业经理对企业状况和生产程序负完全责任，他的命令必须执行。经理不仅要对自己所发出的命令的正确性负责，而且要保证这一命令得到工作人员的及时而准确的执行。
    一个经理经常藉口他的命令正确而且及时发出但未被执行，以替其企业工作不好辩护的情形，是不能容忍的。经理应当了解自己的下级工作人员，检查所发命令的执行情况，应当以优秀的比较能干的工作人员来代替那些不能执行命令的、敷衍塞责的工作人员。
    必须坚决加强企业的一长制，使企业经理真正成为对企业状况和生产程序负完全责任的全权领导者。
    关于加强生产的技术领导。工业和运输业工作之所以发生毛病，还因为工程师和技术人员干部在很多场合下的配备和利用不当。
    企业、车间即直接生产场所常常很缺乏熟练专家，但同时大批专家却坐在中央和地方机关的办公室里。
    同志们！我们手头握有工业人民委员部系统内专家（二十一万四千名有高等教育程度的专家和十六万四千名有中等教育程度的专家）配备情况的材料。这些材料把工业部门分配专家的情况说明如下：
    在二十一万四千名有高等教育程度的专家中，九万五千人（即占百分之四五）被分配在人民委员部系统内的各机关工作。五万一千人（即占百分之二四）做工业企业的工厂管理工作，只有八万二千人（即占百分之三一）在工业企业内直接参加生产。
    在十六万四千名有中等教育程度的专家中，四万一千人（即占百分之二五）被分配在人民委员部的各机关内工作。四万一千人（即占百分之二五）做工业企业的工厂管理工作，八万二千人（即占百分之五○）在工业企业内直接参加生产。
    在石油业人民委员部直接参加生产的、有高等教育程度的专家只有百分之二○；在电站人民委员部——只百分之一六；在采煤业人民委员部——百分之二七；在鱼类工业人民委员部——只百分之九；在木材工业人民委员部——百分之二四。
    其他工业人民委员部在分配和使用有高等教育程度的专家方面，也有类似的情况。
    这种对工程师和技术人员使用不当的情形，给我们的国民经济带来损失，并使企业丧失必要的技术领导。同志们！只要指出：在工业中有大量受过高等教育的专家的职位应由工程师代替，而这些专家却极端缺乏，就可以说明这点。
    在企业车间主任中，受过高等教育的专家只有百分之二二。在车间副主任中专家占百分之三二，在轮班、工段、科、工区和机组等负责人中，专家只占百分之二○。在车间工程师中，专家只占百分之六○。上述各工作岗位上的其他人员都没有受过专门技术教育。
    经济管理机关，正如我国整个国家机关，是有着重大意义的。在这一机关内必须有一定数量的熟练工程师和技术人员工作。但是，如果这一机关过分扩充员额，使工程师和技术人员坐在办公室里，从而使他们脱离生产，那是完全反常的。
    必须纠正在分配工程师和技术人员干部方面的反常现象，把在中央和地方经济机关工作的部分专家调到企业中去，以加强对生产的技术领导。
    必须用一切办法加强对生产的技术领导。
    对于刚从高等学校毕业的年青专家，必须建立一种制度：使每一个从高等学校毕业出来的人都能获得企业的生产经验，按一定的顺序经过一定的实际工作的见习阶段，逐次提升为车间副工长、工长和工程师。
    关于工长。同志们！工长必须在执行我们企业的制度、正确组织劳动和保证严格遵守技术操作过程纪律方面起重大作用。
    但是，我们有许多企业却把工长降低到辅助工人和事务员的地位，他们整天不是为缺乏零件和工具而奔走厂内，便是忙于各种事务管理工作。
    必须减去工长的一切不必要的职务。
    必须在企业中提高直接组织生产的工长的作用，因此就要使工长成为他所领导的工段的全权领导者，对遵守技术操作纪律和按各种指标完成生产任务负完全的责任。
    为消灭工业和运输业工作中的缺点，党组织在经济和政治任务方面所应采取的办法就是如此。
    （四）党组织在工业和运输业方面的组织任务
    同志们！为要顺利解决发展工业和运输业的任务，必须大大改进我们在工业和运输业方面的组织工作。
    斯大林同志教导我们说，经济上的胜利及这一胜利的巩固和持久，完全取决于党的组织工作和政治工作的成功。没有这些条件，则经济上的胜利就像建筑在沙漠上一样。
    为要消灭工业和运输业工作中的缺点，在党组织的组织任务方面应采取哪些办法呢？
    这里首先要谈到的是：为了加强对工业和运输业人民委员部和企业的帮助，必须在工业发达的市、省、边区和共和国内，根据市、省、边区和共和国现有的基本工业部门，设置几个（非一个）管理工业的市委书记或省委书记等，以及在需要的地方设置一个管理铁路运输的书记和一个管理水运的书记。
    大家知道，现在在我们党的市委和省委中，只有一个书记在管理工业和运输业。经验证明，这显然是不够的。
    在发给大家的决议草案中，建议在市委和省委中增添管理工业和运输业的书记。
    挑选负责管理工业的书记，这是市委和省委的一件非常重大的工作。这件工作是十分重要的，必须以十分小心和负责的态度去处理它。
    必须把优秀的工作人员提拔到这种工作岗位上去。这种工作人员必须是能够以布尔什维克精神钻研工业和运输业的业务，能够实际地而不是口头地把党组织的注意力扭转到工业和运输业方面的人。
    负责管理工业和运输业的书记应当熟悉企业的工作情况，定期地到企业中去；必须亲自与企业工作人员以及与有关人民委员部取得联系；必须帮助它们完成计划及执行党在工业和运输业方面的决议，有系统地检查这些决议的执行情况，揭露企业工作中的缺点和力求克服这些缺点。
    关于各市委、省委和党中央对于挑选管理工业和运输业的书记这件工作的处理，最近根据个别的市、省、边区和共和国的工业和运输业工作的结果看来，也就可以知道了。
    第二个最重要的组织任务，是大大加强党组织对挑选工业和运输业工作干部的注意。
    首先，必须考察和熟悉工业企业和铁路的经济工作人员和工程技术人员。如果没有对人员的这种考察和熟悉，就决不能做到正确而及时地解决撤换不称职的工作人员和提拔有能力而富有创造性的人员的问题。
    同志们！必须克服在纸面上和坐在办公室里研究工作人员的做法。
    必须克服在挑选干部中用人唯亲的观点，要在实际工作中来检查工作人员，在评价工作人员时要按他们的工作而不应根据他们的履历表。
    尽管有党的指示，很多党机关和经济机关在任命一个工作人员的时候，至今还是过多地调查他的家谱，调查谁是他的祖父祖母，而不注意考察他本人的业务能力和政治品质。
    关于正确提拔新工作人员的问题，是挑选干部的基本问题。必须更大胆地提拔善于做实际工作的优秀的、有能力的、富有创造精神的工作人员。
    同时必须懂得，这里所谈到要提拔的，不仅是党的布尔什维克，而且也包括非党的布尔什维克。
    在非党员中间，有很多是正直的有才干的工作人员，他们虽然没有参加党、没有党龄，但是他们常常比某些有党龄的共产党员工作得更好、更诚实。
    斯大林同志屡次讥笑那些认为只有党员同志才能提拔来担任领导职务的工作人员。斯大林同志在一九三一年经济工作人员的会议上说道：“有些同志认为只有党员同志才可提拔来担任工厂领导职务。于是他们就往往埋没那些有才能有首创精神的非党同志，而把党员同志提到首位，那怕这些党员同志才能较小、没有首倡精神。不消说，这种所谓‘政策’，是愚蠢而反动到极点的。”
    提拔有才能、富有创造精神的工作人员时，必须及时地注意撤换不称职、能力差、优柔寡断的工作人员以及更换不善做实际工作的空谈家。
    往往遇见这种不中用的、不能做实际工作的空谈家，他们长期地在损害我们的事业。而我们的人民委员部、党的省委和市委对于这种情况却熟视无睹，也不设法把这种所谓“工作人员”驱逐出去。
    我们常有这样的情形：工厂常接到生产特别必需品的紧急任务。而领导这一企业的是一位低能的经济工作者，他不是一个能够完成这一紧急任务的工作人员，而是一位空谈家。
    省委书记询问这位经理完成任务的情况，这位空谈家回答说：“正在加油干，书记同志。”书记就满意了；既然正在加油干，这就是说，事情会办好的。
    但是，很快发现事情一点也没有办好，任务没有完成。省委书记又问经理：“怎么一回事？为什么没有完成任务？”空谈家答道：“正在研究，书记同志。”书记也满足于这个答复，既然一个人肯研究，那就是说，很快会有结果的。但是，工作并没有进展，于是又问经理：“为什么至今产品还没有制造出来？”“书记同志，工作发生了障碍，过几天事情就会改善的。”过了些时候，还是没有见到任何产品。书记问道：“你们工厂在干些什么呢？”这位空谈家回答：“正在消灭缺点和不协调现象。”
    就这样无休止地在愚弄人们的头脑。同志们！即使出乎意料之外，这位经理终于迟迟地生产出不多的产品来，那末也别指望他会经常有系统的生产。他很快会停止这一出产，那是必然的。如果问他：“怎么回事？为什么你们刚才开始出产就立刻停止了呢？”空谈家会给你找到答案，并且在这种场合下他一定会这样说：“备用品都用完了。”
    我们的省委书记就是这样被这些无能的企业领导者、空谈家愚弄了。
    空谈家用了“研究”，“有障碍”，“正在消灭缺点和不协调现象”等字眼作为自己的武器，他们靠国家供养过日子，耗费大量金钱，但是对国民经济却毫无贡献。
    而我们许多领导者听了这些回答，也就感到满足，但他们并不确切地知道无能的经济工作者实在要说什么。原来，正如一首歌所唱的：“……谁知道他，暗示的是什么”。（笑声）不错，在歌词中终于弄清了所说的是什么。你们记得，在歌子里，对这件事情略用一点心思猜猜，事情也就清楚了。但对于空谈家，事情却始终没有猜透。这显然是人们用心不够的缘故。必须开动脑筋，及时识破空谈家。
    同志们！现在应该把这种经济工作者在光天化日之下揭露出来。应该撤换不能做实际工作的空谈家，把他们调去做更小的工作，不论他们是党的或非党的工作人员。
    同志们！我们还有另一类型的工作人员，这就是不学无术的人。不学无术的人就是什么都不懂、什么也不愿懂的人。不学无术的人不研究技术，不承认新技术；他头脑里毫无技术操作的概念，不了解也不愿去了解企业的经济。可是他的骄傲自大却绰绰有余。
    不学无术的人自信他什么都懂，用不着研究，宇宙间没有一种力量能够使不学无术的人相信他有所不懂的东西。
    萨尔蒂科夫——谢德林描写一个主人公时写道：“他既非技师，又非工程师。……他既不懂得河流形成的过程，也不懂得河流是向下而不是向上流的规律。但是他自信只要指明：
    由这个地方到那个地方，即在测量过的地区内，一定会发生大陆，然后河流会像从前一样，向右和向左继续流去。”
    在我们今天，也有这类不学无术的人。这种不学无术的人一旦担负了企业经理、铁路站长或者其他什么职位，便什么也不愿意听取了。这种人，你跟他谈新技术，谈改进技术操作过程的必要，谈企业要讲究清洁和建立秩序，他充耳不闻，固执其愚昧无知的见解，对任何建议和任何指示都不理睬。（全场活跃）他说，我有自己的看法，我自己一切都能。同时，他平常还以无产阶级出身自夸。
    显然，对于这种所谓领导者是不能指望生产什么新产品，有良好质量和采用新技术的。
    同志们！必须揭穿这些不学无术的人，把他们从领导岗位上赶出去。决不能让不学无术的人来领导企业或担任一般的领导工作。他们只会破坏我们的活生生的事业。
    但是，同志们！为要及时撤换不称职的工作人员，及时提拔精通业务的新人材，必须改善党组织及经济组织对干部的考察、挑选和提拔工作的状况。
    尤其必须彻底改善管理干部的副人民委员的工作，因为这些副人民委员工作虽久但至今工作能力仍然很弱。
    同志们！现在谈一谈铁路运输和水路运输的政治部。
    必须指出一点，就是应该立刻消除铁路和水路运输的各政治部与地方党组织的脱节现象，政治部必须向省委和市委汇报工作。
    必须直接而公开地指出，运输业政治部的工作，特别是铁路运输业政治部的工作，是很不能令人满意的。政治部的工作存在着文牍主义，它们忙于从各地收到无数报告书和发送大量电报和公文，以代替其本身的工作。
    许多政治部变成了运输业主管机关很坏的附属品，他们掩饰主管机关的缺点，甚至向党组织提醒运输业工作缺点的这一基本职责都不能履行。
    在政治部内有这样的工作人员，他们忘记了对党和国家的布尔什维克的责任，他们依靠国家过着安乐的日子，但是对提高运输业的工作却袖手旁观。
    同志们！在组织问题中还应谈到经济、生产工作积极分子的问题。
    必须指出，近来我们对积极分子的工作做得很差。许多人民委员部完全忽视了这一工作，不召集积极分子会议。
    这在相当程度上说明了我们某些领导者的自满情绪。
    这些领导者认为他们什么都懂，不需要与积极分子商量，用不着考虑下级工作人员、工程师、技术人员以及斯大哈诺夫工作者的经验。
    这些领导者害怕开展批评和自我批评。
    这些领导者忘记斯大林同志教导我们的话。
    大家都记得，斯大林同志在斯大哈诺夫工作者会议上曾经表示感谢出席会议的人的发言和提出意见所给予的帮助。斯大林同志在这次会议上说道：“忽视这种实践经验的领导者，决不能算作真正的领导者，——这一点难道可以怀疑么？”
    必须重新强调企业和人民委员部的生产、经济工作积极分子的作用。积极分子必须在这方面起重大作用，即他们应当充分地利用下级经济工作人员、党工作人员、工程师、技术人员和斯大哈诺夫工作者的经验，同时还应当向工业工作人员解释工业和运输业方面的各项重要措施的意义。必须召开有工业不同部门工作人员参加的积极分子会议以及工业和运输业各个部门的积极分子会议。为要在积极分子大会上认真严肃地讨论当前问题，经济领导者和党组织对这一会议应作周密的准备。
    现在来谈一谈社会主义竞赛和斯大哈诺夫运动。它们的意义不必多讲了。我只想指出，在我们许多企业内党组织和工会对社会主义竞赛和斯大哈诺夫运动的领导，是不能令人满意的。
    由于对于斯大哈诺夫运动的领导采取形式主义态度，因而在企业中还存在着下面这样的事实：企业全体工人中有一半以上都卷入了斯大哈诺夫运动，而同时这一企业内却还肮脏不堪、车间里堆满废物，大多数工人完不成定额，甚至企业也没有完成其生产计划。
    必须大力开展斯大哈诺夫运动，发挥斯大哈诺夫工作者的创造精神，用以提高劳动生产率，解决生产中的重要问题，提高落后工段的生产水平。
    同志们！现在谈谈最后一个问题。必须指出，在企业中仍然还有错误地在工作时间内举行社会组织的各种会议的情形。
    因此，在发给大家的决议草案中建议党组织、苏维埃组织、工会以及其他社会组织绝对禁止：
    （一）各企业和机关在工作时间内举行集会及召开其它各种会议；
    （二）在工作时间召唤工人和职员；
    （三）抽调企业和机关的工人和职员去做临时的工作或出差担任自愿帮助之类的工作；
    （四）在工作时间内把企业和机关的工人和职员从他们的直接工作派去做社会组织所托付的调查委员会和小组的工作。
    必须肯定地确立一种制度，使企业和机关的工人、职员只能在非工作时间内做社会组织的工作。
    为要消灭工业和运输业工作的缺点，党组织在组织任务方面所应当采取的办法就是如此。
    同志们！我们的工业过去和现在都是整个国民经济发展的基础。工业过去和现在都是整个国民经济系统中的领导基础。工业领导着包括农业和运输业在内的我国整个社会主义经济前进。工业过去和现在都是国防力量的基础。
    我们的任务就是要把发展社会主义工业的事业不断推向前进。
    我们的工业和运输业在一九四一年面临新的巨大的任务。必须这样进行工作，使这一年内所有的省、市和工业中心都没有一个落后的企业。
    在我们的工业中不应该有落后的企业。一切工厂、矿坑、铁路都应该完成计划。
    为完成计划而奋斗，保证完成计划，按照计划工作，这就是说：
    （一）不应当像以前那样只是平均地完成年度、季度、月度的出产计划，而应当按计划、按预先制定的成品生产指示图表均衡地完成计划；
    （二）不应当像以前那样只是按整个工业部门平均地完成计划，而是要使每个企业都能完成各自的计划；
    （三）不应当像以前那样只是按企业平均地完成计划，而是要使每个车间，每个小组，每部车床，每一换班都能逐日地完成计划；
    （四）不应当只按照数量指标完成计划，而且必须在质量上、成套地和按品种地完成计划，并要合乎规格和遵照既定的成本计划。我们应该而且一定能够在最近时期内进一步提高我们的工业和运输业。必须使我们的工业和运输业的所有党组织和领导工作人员，都以布尔什维克的顽强精神立即克服工业和运输业工作中的缺点，根本地改善自己在这方面的工作。我们不能满足于已得的成就，不能不看见工业和运输业工作中的重大缺点。对于缺点的宽容态度，是极端危险而有害的。
    宽大情绪和对于成就的自满自足已经在我们某些地方滋长和发展起来，这是不能容许的。这种情绪会使工作人员成为要求不严和漠视缺点的人。这种情绪会使布尔什维克丢脸。
    斯大林同志教导我们说，布尔什维克的特点应当是：对缺点决不调和，对自己、对自己全部工作有严格要求。（暴风雨般的鼓掌）
    布尔什维克应该把国家的利益，祖国的利益看得高于一切。布尔什维克在执行党和政府的决议上应当是严守纪律的人。法律是一切人的法律。我们都是国家的勤务员。斯大林同志这样地教导我们。（鼓掌）
    布尔什维克必须是在新技术、新产品、新生产方法问题上反对墨守陈规的真正战士。必须培养我们的工作人员掌握技术的兴趣，必须提拔能精通技术的人材。因为没有人材，技术就是废物。布尔什维克，技术和经济上的革命家，是善于打破旧传统、建立新传统和不断进步的人。斯大林同志这样地教导我们。（鼓掌）无疑，我们的党正严格执行斯大林同志的指示，动员全体工人、职员、工程师和技术人员，于最短期间使工业和运输业的工作达到高度的组织性和最高限度的生产率。工业和运输业的工作一定会获得更大的改进，一定会使各部门出产更多与质量更好的产品。在人民领袖斯大林同志坚强的和英明的领导下，我们伟大的祖国正走向新的、决定性的共产主义胜利！（暴风雨般的鼓掌，全体起立）
