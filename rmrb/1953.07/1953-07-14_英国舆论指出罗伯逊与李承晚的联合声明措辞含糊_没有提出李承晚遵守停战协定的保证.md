Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: London News: British public opinion believes that the joint statement between Robertson and Syngman Rhee did not provide guarantees on the issue of Syngman Rhee abiding by the armistice agreement.

The "Manchester Guardian" said that the hope for an armistice "remains uncertain." The newspaper said that the statement after the negotiations between Syngman Rhee and Robertson "neither says that Syngman Rhee will participate in the armistice agreement, nor does it say that he will allow the armistice agreement to be concluded and the terms of the armistice agreement to be implemented without taking those drastic steps that his government has been threatening to take."

The "Daily Telegraph" said: "It is currently impossible to accurately say what agreement has been reached between Robertson and Syngman Rhee, nor can it be said whether this agreement will pass when it is submitted for review (which is now the time it must be raised)."

The "News Chronicle" said: "Whether Syngman Rhee has agreed to the armistice, or whether he is just pretending to agree, no one can know the truth... The American authorities present (in Korea) do not seem to think that the armistice has been seriously hit, on the contrary, they are preparing to sign. ... However, no one will believe in the armistice until they see that it has been firmly achieved."

According to Reuters, observers in London pointed out that the general wording of the joint statement is relatively vague and reflects Syngman Rhee's negative opposition. They warned that it is necessary to be vigilant about Syngman Rhee's attempt to undermine the armistice at the last minute. They demanded that the "allies" put pressure on the United States to eliminate Syngman Rhee's hidden intentions and immediately sign the armistice agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: Paignton News: The British National Union of Railwaymen passed a resolution on the 9th condemning Syngman Rhee for undermining the Korean armistice. G.S. McNaughton, who proposed the motion, said that Syngman Rhee was a "small reactionary who should be disciplined." He said that Syngman Rhee "is the biggest stumbling block to the armistice agreement that will resolve the futile Korean War that everyone is tired of."

    英国舆论指出罗伯逊与李承晚的联合声明措辞含糊
    没有提出李承晚遵守停战协定的保证
    【新华社十三日讯】伦敦消息：英国舆论认为罗伯逊与李承晚的联合声明并未在李承晚遵守停战协定的问题上提出保证。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”说，停战的希望“仍然不能肯定”。该报说，李承晚与罗伯逊谈判后的声明“既没有说李承晚将参加停战协定，也没有说他将让停战协定缔结并让停战协定条款实施而不采取他的政府一直在扬言要采取的那些剧烈步骤”。
    “每日电讯报”说：“目前不可能精确地说罗伯逊与李承晚之间达成了什么协议，也不能说当这个协议提交审查（现在正是必须提出的时候）时是否能通得过。”
    “新闻纪事报”说：“李承晚是否已同意停战，或是他只是假装同意，没有人能够知道真相……在场（朝鲜）的美国当局看来并不认为停战已受到严重打击，相反的，他们正在准备签字了。……但是人们在看到停战已经巩固地实现前，没有一个人会相信停战的。”
    另据路透社报道，伦敦的观察家们指出，联合声明的一般措辞比较含糊，也反映出李承晚的消极反对的态度。他们警告说，必须警惕李承晚在最后一分钟破坏停战的企图。他们要求“盟国”对美国施加压力，以便排除李承晚的暗藏着的企图，立即签订停战协定。
    【新华社十一日讯】培恩顿消息：英国全国铁路工人工会在九日通过的一项决议案中谴责李承晚破坏朝鲜停战。提出这项提案的格·斯·麦格诺顿说，李承晚是一个“应该加以管束的小反动派”。他说，李承晚“是解决每个人都厌倦了的、毫无益处的朝鲜战争的停战协定的最大绊脚石”。
