Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: The movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade is continuing to develop in various parts of Japan.

    On July 1st, the "Western District Trade Union Council for Promoting Sino-Japanese Trade," composed of 32 trade union organizations in the western part of Tokyo, sent four representatives to petition the Diet, demanding the rapid relaxation of the "embargo" list; and advocated that the Japanese government should guarantee the freedom of representatives from relevant sectors to go abroad to China to discuss trade, and allow merchants to go to China for trade.
    The movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade has recently become very active in the central region of Japan. On June 8th, Fukui Prefecture held a prefectural rally to promote Sino-Japanese trade. More than 800 people braved the rain to participate. Yoshiro Hirano, chairman of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Council, and some Diet members also attended the conference. The conference adopted a declaration and made resolutions to send a trade delegation to China. The Kanazawa City Council in Ishikawa Prefecture held a plenary meeting of city councilors on June 20th, and resolved to participate in the movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade. In terms of trade unions, activities such as symposiums to promote Sino-Japanese trade were held, mainly by metalworkers.
    Driven by the movement to promote Sino-Japanese trade launched by local workers and manufacturers, the councilors of Kushiro City, Hokkaido, also unanimously passed a resolution to "restore Sino-Japanese trade" at the city council meeting held on June 18th, and decided to petition the Japanese government.

    日本人民要求日中贸易的运动广泛发展
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：促进日中贸易的运动，正在日本各地继续发展。
    七月一日，由东京都西部地区三十二个工会团体组成的“促进日中贸易西部地区工会协议会”，派出了四名代表，向国会请愿，要求迅速放宽“禁运”名单；并主张日本政府要保障有关各界代表前往中国商谈贸易的出国自由，和允许商人前往中国进行贸易。
    促进日中贸易的运动，近来在日本中部地区显得非常活跃。六月八日，福井县举行了促进日中贸易的县民奋起大会。当时有八百多人冒雨赶来参加。日中贸易促进会议主席平野义太郎和一些国会议员也前来参加大会。大会通过了宣言，并作出派遣贸易代表团去中国等项决议。石川县金泽市的市议会，在六月二十日召开了市议员全体会议，会上决议参加促进日中贸易的运动。在工会方面，以五金工人为主，举行了促进日中贸易座谈会等活动。
    北海道钏路市的议员们，在当地工人和厂商所展开的促进日中贸易运动的推动下，在六月十八日召开的市议会上，也一致通过了“恢复日中贸易”的决议，并决定向日本政府进行请愿。
