    Soviet Union Holds Symposium on Works of Poet Mayakovsky

    At the end of January this year, the Soviet Writers' Union and the Gorky Institute of World Literature jointly held a national symposium in Moscow on the works of the great Soviet poet Mayakovsky. The symposium lasted for six days and aroused great interest among the Soviet people. More than 50 experts, critics, writers, poets, and literature professors attended the symposium and engaged in heated debates.

    The symposium was convened to address several fundamental issues related to the research on Mayakovsky's works, where some erroneous viewpoints had existed in the past.

    Three complete collections and various selected works of Mayakovsky's writings have been published, along with more than 20 monographs commenting on his works and biography. These authors, including annotators of Mayakovsky's works, have inconsistent interpretations of the poet's influence on modern poetry. Some even have differing views on the same historical facts. Instead of helping readers gain a correct understanding of the poet's literary career, some writers and critics have stubbornly adhered to their own views and mutually excluded each other, causing confusion. Recently, some have even attempted to monopolize research work, forcing readers to accept the prejudices of a few. This tendency has developed into sectarianism. A small number of people have shown an extremely unhumble attitude towards anyone who disagrees with them.

    The opening speech was delivered by poet Alexei Surkov, followed by a report on Mayakovsky by F.P. Drugin, the editor-in-chief of "Zvezda" magazine and a critic. At the start of the discussion, S. Tregub, a representative of the group attempting to monopolize research work, spoke, affirming that the poet's development proceeded along "a straight line." The revolution seemed to have little impact on the poet's worldview and works. Based on this view, some critics affirmed that Mayakovsky had a high degree of revolutionary consciousness from the beginning. Another opinion, held by the majority, believed that although the early poet was inclined towards revolution, the path he took was tortuous; his genius was truly brought to fruition during the October Revolution, making him a poet of the October Revolution and a poet of the Soviet era.

    Drugin believed that Mayakovsky had an organic connection with the tradition of Russian classical poetry, represented by Pushkin, Lermontov, and Nekrasov, and also believed that the poet's works had undergone changes. This change occurred with the development of the country's history and the revolution. The poet himself also underwent changes, gradually developing and maturing. He went through three stages: first, before 1917; second, from 1917 to 1923; and finally, from the long poem "Lenin" until his death in 1930.

    Regarding the poet's early works, there are two basic questions: the relationship between the poet and the revolution; and the relationship between the poet and futurism.

    Futurism is a reactionary artistic trend that reflects the decadence of the bourgeoisie. Some people mistakenly regard futurism as a progressive trend simply because Mayakovsky spent a short time with the futurists. According to their opinion, the futurists created a "new language," based on Marr's erroneous linguistic theory. They also believed that the futurists had established a completely new poetic form, abandoning the poetic forms of classical poetry and drawing an insurmountable gap between the new and classical poetic forms. This erroneous view has long been retained in school textbooks and recent commentaries.

    Another tendency is represented by the opinion of V. Ognev, published in "Novy Mir" magazine. He violated historical truth and regarded the early Mayakovsky as a poet of socialist realism. However, some researchers of the poet's early works judged based on some individual facts, giving readers the incorrect impression that Mayakovsky constantly went from one mistake to another.

    The discussion touched on the shortcomings of the editing work of Mayakovsky's collection of poems. Drugin pointed out that some annotators regarded the poet as a factional activist in literature. Several volumes of the twelve-volume complete collection, which had been used as original material by many anthology editors, had the above-mentioned errors, and this work, called the complete collection, was in fact incomplete, not including some of the works published by the poet in newspapers and periodicals in the 1920s. And some declarations and documents, which could not originally be confirmed as being written by Mayakovsky, were instead included.

    In some treatises, Mayakovsky's poetry style is often narrowly referred to as "free verse," and it is regarded as an unregulated, prosaic structure equivalent to everyday spoken language.

    Drugin believed that the question of his art should not be regarded merely as a question of poetic form. Mayakovsky is one of the founders of socialist realist poetry, an innovator in terms of subject matter, and also an engineer of the souls of Soviet people.

    Poets Surkov, Gribachev, Sayanov, and others all pointed out the errors and narrow-mindedness of Tregub and his small group.

    Gribachev exposed Tregub's sectarianism. All poets who do not write so-called Mayakovsky-style "recitation poems" today are regarded by Tregub as not being inheritors of the Mayakovsky tradition. It is not difficult to understand that Mayakovsky's art did not arise from a blank slate; it grew from the fertile soil left by the great poets of the past. Mayakovsky's greatness lies in the fact that he inherited and developed the excellent traditions of Russian classical poetry under new historical conditions.

    Gribachev refuted Tregub's statement that Mayakovsky did not completely abandon classical poetry techniques, but rather cleverly exploited its potential, enabling the form to fully express modern themes, the thoughts and feelings of the revolutionary masses, and the language of the masses.

    Gribachev concluded by saying that new talented poets of the Soviet Union will continue to emerge from the people, and they will develop along the artistic forms they freely choose, just as Mayakovsky expected:

    Let us have more poets,
    Good poets,
    Different poets…

    Surkov pointed out that Tregub's most serious mistake was to say that many Soviet poets were "detached" side branches from Mayakovsky, while limiting the so-called "Mayakovsky school" to only three or four poets such as Aseyev, Kirsanov, and Lukonin.

    Literary critic N. Levermatovskaya spoke about Mayakovsky's influence on many poets in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. She believed that it should be permissible to list those poets who have opened up new revolutionary land in the garden of national poetry together with Mayakovsky. Just as the ideological influence of the great October Socialist Revolution is connected with the revolutionary ideas within a particular country, the narrow, so-called "Mayakovsky school" concept of sectarianism is completely wrong.

    Konstantin Simonov made a concluding report on behalf of the Secretariat of the Writers' Union, believing that the symposium had achieved effective results. In recent years, the number of researchers of Mayakovsky is increasing, and the scientific level of research work is improving every year. Finally, he pointed out the direction of future research work. (Wang Lingjie translated from "Soviet Literature" No. 3)

### 苏联举行诗人马雅可夫斯基作品讨论会

    苏联举行诗人马雅可夫斯基作品讨论会
    本年一月末，苏联作家协会和高尔基世界文学研究院联合在莫斯科召开了一个全国性的关于苏联伟大诗人马雅可夫斯基作品的讨论会，一共举行了六天，引起苏联人民的极大兴趣。出席讨论会的有专家、批评家、作家、诗人和文学教授共五十多人，展开了热烈的论争。
    会议的召开是为了要解决有关马雅可夫斯基作品研究工作方面的几个基本问题，过去在这一方面存在着一些错误观点。
    马雅可夫斯基的著作已经出版了三种全集和多种选集，评述他的作品和传记的单行本也已经出版了二十多种。这些作者，包括马雅可夫斯基作品注释者在内，对诗人在现代诗歌方面的影响的解释是不一致的，甚至有些人对同一历史事实有不同的看法。若干作家和批评家非但不能帮助读者对诗人的文学事业获得正确的认识，而且各执一词互相排斥，反而引起混乱。最近甚至有人企图独占研究工作，强使读者接受少数人的偏见。这种倾向已发展为宗派主义。少数人对一切不同意他们意见的人表现了极不虚心的态度。
    致开幕辞的是诗人亚历克赛·苏尔柯夫，接着由“星”杂志主编、批评家弗·帕·德鲁金作关于马雅可夫斯基的报告。讨论一开始，企图独占研究工作的一批人的代表人斯·特列古柏就发言，肯定诗人的发展是按着“一条直线”进行的。革命对诗人的世界观和作品似乎没有多大影响。由于这一观点，若干批评家就肯定马雅可夫斯基一开始就具有高度革命意识。另一种属于多数人的意见则认为早期的诗人虽已倾向革命，但他所走的道路是曲折的；他的天才到了十月革命时才真正发扬光大，成为十月革命的诗人，苏维埃时代的诗人。
    德鲁金认为马雅可夫斯基和俄罗斯古典诗歌传统——以普希金、莱蒙托夫、涅克拉索夫为代表——是有有机的联系的，同时认为诗人的作品曾经发生过变化。这个变化是随着国家的历史、革命的发展而变化的。诗人本身也起着变化，逐渐发展以至成熟。他经历了三个阶段：第一，一九一七年以前；第二，一九一七年到一九二三年；最后是从长诗“列宁”开始到他在一九三○年逝世为止。
    关于诗人的早期作品，存在着两个基本问题：诗人与革命的关系；诗人与未来主义的关系。
    未来主义是反映资产阶级的腐朽性的反动艺术倾向。有些人仅仅因为马雅可夫斯基有一个短时间和未来派在一起，就错误地把未来主义当作了一种进步倾向。按照他们的意见，未来派创造了一种“新语言”，而以马尔的错误的语言学说为根据。并认为未来派已建立了一种完全新的诗体，废弃了古典诗歌的诗体，而在新的诗体和古典诗体之间划了一道不可逾越的鸿沟。这种错误见解长久保留在学校教科书中以及最近的评论中。
    另一种倾向可以“新世界”杂志上发表的弗·奥格涅夫的意见为代表，他违反了历史的真实，把早期的马雅可夫斯基也认为是社会主义现实主义的诗人。但也有一种研究诗人早期作品的人根据一些个别事实来判断，使读者得到一个不正确的印象，好像马雅可夫斯基经常从一个错误走到另一个错误。
    讨论关涉到马雅可夫斯基诗集编辑工作的缺点，德鲁金指出，若干注释家把诗人视为文学上的派别活动者。曾经被许多选集编辑人当作原始材料的十二卷全集本中有几卷就有上述的错误，而且这被称为全集的著作，事实上还是不全的，没有包括二十年代诗人在报刊上发表的一部分作品。而其中有某些宣言和文件原不能肯定为马雅可夫斯基所作，却反而包括在内。
    在一部分论著中，常常把马雅可夫斯基的诗歌体裁狭义地称为“自由诗”，把它看成与日常口语相等的毫无规律的散文化的结构。
    德鲁金认为，关于他的艺术问题不应该看作仅仅是诗歌的形式问题。马雅可夫斯基是社会主义现实主义诗歌的奠基者之一，是题材方面的创新者，也是苏维埃人的灵魂工程师。
    诗人苏尔柯夫、格里巴巧夫、萨阳诺夫等都指出了特列古柏和属于他的小集团的一辈人的错误和偏狭。
    格里巴巧夫揭露了特列古柏的宗派主义。凡是今天不写所谓马雅可夫斯基式的“朗诵诗”的诗人，都被特列古柏视为非马雅可夫斯基传统的继承者。不难明白，马雅可夫斯基的艺术不是从空地上产生的；它是从过去的伟大诗人们所遗下的沃土上生长起来的。马雅可夫斯基的伟大就在于他在新的历史条件下承继了发展了俄罗斯古典诗歌的优良传统。
    格里巴巧夫驳斥了特列古柏的说法，马雅可夫斯基并没有彻底废弃古典诗歌作法，而只是巧妙地发挥了它的潜在能力，使形式具有充分表现现代主题、革命群众思想感情和群众语言的可能性。
    格里巴巧夫最后说，苏联的新的天才诗人们将不断在人民中产生，他们将按各人自由地选择的艺术形式的道路发展，一如马雅可夫斯基所期待的：
    让我们有更多的诗人，
    好的诗人，
    各种不同的诗人……
    苏尔柯夫指出特列古柏的最严重的错误是把许多苏联诗人说成是与马雅可夫斯基“脱离”的旁支，而把所谓“马雅可夫斯基派”限于只有阿塞也夫、基尔萨诺夫、鲁科宁等三、四个诗人。
    文学批评家恩·列佛尔玛特斯卡娅谈到了马雅可夫斯基对波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚的许多诗人的影响。她认为把那些在民族诗歌的园地上开辟了新的革命的土地的诗人，与马雅可夫斯基列在一起，是应该被许可的。正如伟大的十月社会主义革命的思想影响，与某一特定国家内的革命思想之间是联系着的一样。那种狭隘的所谓“马雅可夫斯基派”的宗派主义的概念是完全错误的。
    康斯坦丁·西蒙诺夫代表作家协会书记处作了总结报告，认为讨论会获得了有效的结果。近年来马雅可夫斯基的研究者正在增多，研究工作的科学水准每年都有提高。最后他指出了今后研究工作的方向。（王陵节译自“苏联文学”三月号）
