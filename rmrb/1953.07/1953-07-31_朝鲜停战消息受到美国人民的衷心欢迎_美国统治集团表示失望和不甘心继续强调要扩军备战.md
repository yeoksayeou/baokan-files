Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The news of the Korean armistice has evoked extremely different reactions in the United States, where interests are so divided among various classes.

    Since almost all news agencies are controlled by big capital, the attitudes of ordinary Americans cannot be fully reflected. However, some truth is revealed in the reports of American bourgeois news agencies. United Press reported that "the American people welcomed the news of the Korean armistice with hope and prayer."

    The happiest were the parents and wives whose sons and husbands were in Korea, who were very fortunate that their loved ones would no longer have to lose their lives meaninglessly on the battlefield.

    For the mothers of American prisoners of war, the signing of the armistice agreement meant the end of a long period of anxious waiting. The mother of U.S. Marine Corps Captain Gerald Fink, a prisoner of war, said, "How wonderful it is to think that he will be home soon!"

    The relatives of American soldiers who were driven to the Korean battlefield and sacrificed their lives felt sad when the news of the armistice came. For them, the news of the armistice came too late.

    However, the politicians, generals, and newspaper commentators of the American ruling clique have completely different reactions to the Korean armistice, which is warmly welcomed by people all over the world, including the American people.

    Many of them, with a feeling of unwillingness, emphasized that the United States should continue to expand its armaments, prepare for war, and maintain a tense situation. House Speaker Martin said that although "the Korean armistice is the most welcome news for people everywhere," the United States must continue to "rely on strength" to achieve its goals. The "Washington Star" used the same tone to teach the American people not to relax their war preparations, "The Korean armistice must obviously be viewed with a not-so-joyful reservation."

    Another group of the American ruling clique simply expressed dissatisfaction with the armistice because the United States had not achieved its predetermined goal of conquering Korea. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Short said that he was not "happy" at all because "America's prestige has been damaged."

    These kinds of frustrated remarks expose the fact that the American authorities are trying to conceal the failure of the American policy of aggression against Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles boasted on the 27th that the Korean War, in which the United States misappropriated the United Nations flag, was a manifestation of the principle of "collective security." According to him, the United States was "safer" many times over because of this war. On the same day, Senate Republican Acting Leader Knowland complained angrily in the Senate that the Korean War, which was mainly borne by the United States, was not a "model of collective security." As for the relationship between the Korean War and American "security," the "Chicago Tribune" made a frank inference in its commentary on the 26th, saying:

    "Apart from the lessons that can be learned from experience, the United States has gained nothing from this war. The most important of these lessons is that we only go to war when our own security truly requires us to do so. This was absolutely not the case in Korea, and that is why, for the first time in its history, the United States is eager to end a war without achieving victory."

    In addition to disappointment and unwillingness, there is also open war clamoring. Van Fleet, the former commander of the U.S. Eighth Army who participated in the war of aggression against Korea, threatened at a press conference in New York on the 27th that if war breaks out again, the United States must use atomic weapons.

    The remarks made by the American ruling clique, which are obviously contrary to the spirit of the armistice agreement, are arousing people's vigilance.

### 朝鲜停战消息受到美国人民的衷心欢迎  美国统治集团表示失望和不甘心继续强调要扩军备战

    朝鲜停战消息受到美国人民的衷心欢迎
    美国统治集团表示失望和不甘心继续强调要扩军备战
    据新华社讯：朝鲜停战的消息，在各阶层利害如此分歧的美国，引起了极不相同的各种各样的反应。
    由于几乎是所有的新闻机构都掌握在大资本手里，普通美国人的态度不可能得到充分的反映。但从美国资产阶级通讯社的报道中，多少也透露了一些真情。合众社报道说，“美国人民以希望和祈祷的心情迎接朝鲜停战的消息”。
    最快乐的是那些有子弟和丈夫在朝鲜的父母们和妻子们，他们十分庆幸自己的亲人不致于再在战场上无谓地丢掉性命。
    对于美国战俘的母亲们说来，停战协定的签字意味着终止了长久的焦心的等待，美国战俘、海军陆战队上尉杰拉德·芬克的母亲说：“想到他很快就要回家了，那是多么好啊！”
    被驱使到朝鲜战场上而牺牲掉性命的美国士兵的亲属们，在停战消息传来时感到悲伤，对于他们说来，停战的消息来得太迟了。
    但是美国统治集团的政客、将军和报纸评论家，对于包括美国人民在内的全世界人民热烈欢迎的朝鲜停战有着完全不同的反应。
    他们中间许多人怀着不甘心的心情，强调美国应该继续扩军备战和保持紧张局势。众议院议长马丁就表示，尽管“朝鲜停战是各地人民所最欢迎的消息”，但是美国必须继续“依靠力量”来达到它所追求的目的。“华盛顿明星报”用同一个调子教训美国人民说：不要放松战争准备，“朝鲜停战显然必须要以一种不是兴高采烈的保留态度来看待。”
    美国统治集团的另一批人干脆对停战表示不满，原因是美国并没有达到预定的征服朝鲜的目标。众议院军事委员会主席肖特说，他一点也不“高兴”，因为“美国的威望受到了损害”。
    这一类沮丧的言论，戳穿了美国当权者所企图掩盖的美国侵略朝鲜政策失败的事实。美国国务卿杜勒斯二十七日吹嘘美国盗用联合国旗帜而进行的朝鲜战争是“集体安全”原则的表现，据他说，美国由于这一场战争而“安全”了好多倍。就在同一天，参议院共和党代理领袖诺兰在参议院愤愤然地抱怨说，主要由美国来承担的朝鲜战争并不是什么
    “集体安全的范例”。至于朝鲜战争与美国“安全”的关系，“芝加哥论坛报”在二十六日的评论中作了坦白的推论，该报说：
    “除了可以从经验中得来的教训之外，美国没有从这场战争中得到任何东西。这些教训中最重要的是，只有在我们自己的安全真正要求我们这样做时，我们才参战。在朝鲜，便绝对不是这种情况，正因为这样，现在，美国在它历史上第一次渴望在未取得胜利之前便结束一场战争。”
    在失望和不甘心之外，也还有一种公开战争叫嚣，曾参加侵朝战争的前美国第八军军长范佛里特二十七日在纽约记者招待会上威胁说，如果战争再起，美国就一定要动用原子武器。
    美国统治集团中间所发出的显然与停战协定精神背道而驰的言论，正引起人们的警惕。
