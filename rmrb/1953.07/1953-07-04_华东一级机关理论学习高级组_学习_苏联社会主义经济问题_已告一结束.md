    华东一级机关理论学习高级组
    学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”已告一结束
    华东一级机关理论学习高级组，自四月初开始学习斯大林同志著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，到六月二十日已告一结束。遵照中共中央华东局指示，参加学习的干部正以写作论文和集中测验两种方式举行考试。学习论文的题目由自己确定，华东局宣传部学习室提出了“我在实际工作中认识和利用客观法则的体会”和“价值法则在我国社会经济中的作用范围及正确利用它的重要性”两个题目供参考。学习论文规定六月三十日以前交卷。集中测验已于六月二十四日举行。测验由中共中央华东局第二书记陈毅同志和华东局宣传部部长舒同同志主持。
    华东一级机关理论学习高级组总人数为五百十三人，参加写学习论文的有一百四十五人，占总人数的百分之二十八点二；参加集中测验的有二百二十三人，占总人数的百分之四十三点四。
    在这次集中测验前各小组都认真地进行了复习。如华东局办公厅、组织部等小组，在考试前根据“苏联社会主义经济问题”著作，依其各个不同重点拟出了若干问答题，分别分配给各个同志进行准备，并要写出答案，然后小组再进行研究，以此方法督促大家进行复习。此次测验，一般达到了督促复习、加深和巩固学习成果的目的。
