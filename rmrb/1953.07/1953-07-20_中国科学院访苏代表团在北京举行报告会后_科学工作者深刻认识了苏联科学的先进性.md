    After the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union Held a Report Meeting in Beijing, Scientific Workers Deeply Recognized the Advanced Nature of Soviet Science
    From June 26th to July 4th, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union held specialized report meetings on nineteen scientific disciplines in Beijing, introducing advanced Soviet science to more than 13,000 of China's well-known scientists, science and technology workers, and educators in Beijing. The delegation also reported on its visit to the Soviet Union and the general situation of Soviet science to the learning symposium of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as staff members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and government agencies, and teachers of universities and colleges.
    The delegation's report aroused great attention in the scientific community and greatly inspired them. After attending the report meeting, science and technology workers and educators in Beijing organized fifteen specialized seminars under the auspices of Li Siguang, Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, and Wu Youxun, vice presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The scientific workers who participated in the seminars unanimously agreed that the delegation's personal experience provided vivid facts that further enhanced their understanding of the superiority and advanced nature of Soviet science. From the delegation's reports, they gained a deeper understanding of the inseparable relationship between science and Marxism-Leninism. They all recognized the importance of unified leadership in Soviet science for scientific research and requested that the Chinese Academy of Sciences strengthen unified ideological leadership in the future. They all believed that the creative debates and criticism and self-criticism carried out in Soviet scientific work are powerful weapons for promoting scientific progress.
    The seminars focused on discussing how to follow the path of Soviet science and, in combination with China's actual conditions, solve the most pressing scientific problems needed to be resolved in China's current construction endeavors and people's lives. Many seminars discussed how science could serve the construction of heavy industry. Mao Yisheng, director of the Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways, proposed at the civil engineering seminar that civil engineering should strengthen the study of soil mechanics to solve problems in engineering construction. For example, most of North China is covered with loess, and various buildings are prone to foundation settlement. Civil engineering should conduct research in conjunction with the problem of preventing foundation settlement in loess layers. He also proposed to study engineering substitutes to save funds for national construction. The mathematics seminar believed that theoretical research in mathematics should be strengthened in the future, and advanced mathematical theories should be used to solve engineering and technical problems. The chemistry seminar clarified the direction of development with analytical chemistry as the main focus, especially microanalysis and metal analysis, so that chemistry can directly serve the construction of heavy industry. Many other seminars discussed the integration of science with agricultural production. Sun Qu, a professor at Beijing Agricultural University, proposed at the soil science seminar that research on soil fertility should be strengthened to improve soil composition in order to increase agricultural production per unit area. The meteorology seminar proposed that weather forecasting should be developed in the future, especially the forecasting of dangerous weather that is closely related to engineering construction, agricultural production, water conservancy, and transportation. Seminars in physiology, medicine, and other disciplines all proposed to take Pavlov's theory as the leading ideology of research. Zhang Xijun, a professor in the Department of Physiology at Peking Union Medical College, said: "Pavlov's theory is the concrete embodiment of Marxism-Leninism in physiology. Pavlov's theory has opened up new avenues for physiology." Zhao Yibing, a professor in the Department of Biology at Peking University, said: Current physiology should focus on the study of labor physiology, so that workers working under various labor conditions can maintain normal physiological development; on the other hand, in conjunction with the needs of national defense, high-altitude physiology should be studied. Liu Sizhi, director of the Department of Biochemistry at Beijing Medical College, proposed that in biochemistry, we should learn from the Soviet Union to study how proteins evolve into living substances as the development direction of research. In order to meet the current needs of the country, research should also be conducted in food processing, crop variety improvement, and immunochemistry to improve the health of the people. Seminars in animal and plant sciences also discussed the discovery and investigation of animal and plant resources to increase the wealth of the motherland.
    In the next few months, the delegation will go to Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places to give reports.

    中国科学院访苏代表团在北京举行报告会后
    科学工作者深刻认识了苏联科学的先进性
    中国科学院访苏代表团从六月二十六日到七月四日在北京举行了十九门科学的专科报告会，向北京的我国著名科学家、科学技术工作者与教育工作者共一万三千多人介绍了苏联的先进科学。代表团还向中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习座谈会，以及中国科学院和政府机关的工作人员，高等学校的教师报告了该团在苏联的访问活动和苏联科学的一般情况。
    代表团的报告引起了科学界极大的重视，并使他们得到了很大的启示。北京的科学技术工作者和教育工作者在参加了报告会后，在中国科学院副院长李四光、陶孟和、竺可桢、吴有训的主持下组织了十五次专科座谈会。参加座谈的科学工作者们一致认为：代表团的亲身经历，提供了生动的事实，使他们更进一步地认识到苏联科学的优越性和先进性。从代表团的传达报告中，他们对科学与马克思列宁主义的不可分割的关系有了更深的体会。他们都认识到苏联科学的统一领导对于科学研究工作的重要意义，并要求中国科学院今后加强统一的思想领导。他们都认为苏联在科学工作中展开创造性的论争和批评与自我批评是推动科学前进的有力武器。
    座谈会着重地讨论了如何遵循着苏联科学的道路并结合我国的实际情况来解决我国当前建设事业和人民生活中最迫切需要解决的科学问题。很多座谈会讨论了科学如何为重工业建设服务的问题。中央人民政府铁道部铁道研究所所长茅以升在土木建筑专科座谈会上提出：土木工程学今后应加强对土壤力学的研究，来解决工程建设中的问题。如华北区多半是黄土层，各种建筑物容易发生地基下沉的现象。土木工程学就应该结合防止黄土层地基下沉的问题来进行研究。他并提出要研究工程代用品，为国家建设节约资金。数学专科座谈会认为今后要加强数学理论的研究，并利用高级的数学理论来解决工程技术中的问题。化学专科座谈会明确了以分析化学为主的发展方向，特别是微量分析和金属分析，使化学直接为重工业建设服务。其他很多座谈会讨论了科学与农业生产相结合的问题。北京农业大学教授孙渠在土壤学专科座谈会上提出应该加强土壤肥力的研究，改善土壤的成份，以提高农业生产的单位面积产量。气象学专科座谈会提出今后要发展天气预报工作，特别是与工程建筑，农业生产，水利运输等方面有密切关系的危险天气预报的工作。生理、医学等专科座谈会都提出要以巴夫洛夫学说为研究的主导思想。中国协和医学院生理学系教授张锡钧说：“巴夫洛夫学说是马克思列宁主义在生理学方面的具体体现。巴夫洛夫学说为生理学开辟了新的道路。”北京大学生物系教授赵以炳说：目前的生理学应该以研究劳动生理为中心，使在各种不同的劳动条件下工作的工人能保持生理上的正常发展；另一方面，结合国防的需要，研究高空生理。北京医学院生物化学系主任刘思职提出：在生物化学方面要学习苏联以研究如何从蛋白质演变成有生命的物质的问题，作为研究工作的发展方向。为了结合目前国家需要也要进行食品加工、农作物品种改良和免疫化学方面的研究，以增进人民的健康。动物、植物等专科座谈会并讨论了动植物资源的发现和调查研究问题，以增加祖国的财富。
    代表团在今后几个月中，将到上海、南京、天津、沈阳、大连等地作传达报告。    （新华社）
