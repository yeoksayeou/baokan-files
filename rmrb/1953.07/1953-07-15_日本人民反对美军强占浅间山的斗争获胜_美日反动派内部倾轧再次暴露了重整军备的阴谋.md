    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 14th: News from Tokyo: The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S. military's forcible occupation of Mount Asama as a training ground has achieved victory. Based on a decision by the "U.S.-Japan Joint Committee," the Japanese Foreign Ministry formally announced on the 12th the cessation of military use of Mount Asama.

    Mount Asama, located between Gunma and Nagano prefectures, is a famous volcanic area in Japan. The University of Tokyo has maintained an earthquake research institute there for twenty years. However, General Clark, head of the U.S. Far East Command, actually chose Mount Asama in Japan as a training ground, intending to train U.S. troops there in mountain warfare. This plan was resolutely opposed by the people of Mount Asama and the Japanese seismological community. With the strong support of the people of the whole country, the people of Mount Asama persisted in a heroic struggle for nearly three and a half months, starting from April 1st. Japanese seismology experts, based on the results of their experiments, also insisted that military exercises would damage earthquake research, and expressed their opposition to the "U.S.-Japan Joint Committee" turning Mount Asama into a training ground. The powerful pressure from the Japanese people finally forced the U.S. Forces Japan Command and the Yoshida government to abandon their plan to forcibly occupy Mount Asama as a training ground.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 14th: News from Tokyo: Due to infighting within the Japanese bourgeoisie, the Yoshida government's secretly planned rearmament plan has once again been exposed.

    Since the resumption of the current session of the Japanese Diet, all opposition parties have unanimously demanded that the Yoshida government formally announce the specific content of the "Five-Year Defense Plan" revealed by Tokutaro Kimura, Director-General of the "Security Agency" on June 9th. However, Yoshida has been reluctant to announce this rearmament plan, which has been met with fierce opposition from Japanese public opinion. On July 8th, Shuji Kawasaki, a member of the House of Representatives from the Kaishinto (Progressive Party) who advocates open rearmament, announced a "Document of the Five-Year Defense Plan of State Minister Tokutaro Kimura" in the House of Representatives Budget Committee in his "personal capacity." The announcement of this "document" left the Yoshida government, which was trying to evade the condemnation of the Japanese people by concealing rearmament, speechless and embarrassed.

    The "document" announced by Kawasaki contained two rearmament drafts, A and B. The former was jointly drafted by the U.S. authorities and former Japanese army and navy personnel, and the latter was drafted by the Japanese "Security Agency." "Draft A" stipulated the establishment of an air force composed of 2,637 aircraft (of which 954 were jets) and a navy totaling 340,000 tons. The navy and air force stipulated in "Draft B" were exactly the same as those revealed by Kimura on June 9th. Kawasaki did not reveal the figures for expanding the army in the two drafts. However, the day after Kawasaki announced these two rearmament drafts – the 9th – U.S. Secretary of State Dulles told the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee: "In the current fiscal year budget bill awaiting approval by the Japanese Diet, the Japanese government has allocated sufficient funds to increase its Security Forces to ten divisions." The current strength of the Japanese "Security Forces" is equivalent to five divisions.

    When Kawasaki announced these two rearmament drafts of the Yoshida government, he said: "The reason why the government is unwilling to announce its defense plan is not only because its position is not yet consolidated, but also because Prime Minister Yoshida's plan to gradually increase Japan's defense capabilities will only reach its limit in the early stages of the 1954-1955 fiscal year. By then, the National Security Forces must possess the equipment to become a modern army." Kawasaki admitted: These two drafts were "drafted in order for Japan to receive aid from the U.S. "Mutual Security Agency"."

    日本人民反对美军强占浅间山的斗争获胜
    美日反动派内部倾轧再次暴露了重整军备的阴谋
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：日本人民反对美军强占浅间山为演习场的斗争已获得胜利，日本外务省根据“美日联合委员会”的决定，在十二日正式宣布停止在军事上使用浅间山。
    位于群马县和长野县之间的浅间山，是日本著名的火山区。东京大学在那里设有历史已达二十年的地震研究所。但远东美军首脑克拉克竟选择日本浅间山为演习场，准备在那里训练美军进行山地战。这个计划遭到了浅间山的人民和日本地震科学界的坚决反对。浅间山人民在全国人民的大力支持下，自四月一日起，坚持了近三个半月的英勇斗争。日本地震学专家也根据实验的结果，坚持军事演习会破坏地震研究的事实，对“美日联合委员会”提出反对变浅间山为演习场的意见。日本人民的强大压力终于迫使驻日美军司令部和吉田政府放弃强占浅间山为演习场的计划。
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：由于日本资产阶级内部的倾轧，吉田政府秘而不宣的重整军备计划又一次被暴露。
    自从日本本届国会复会后，各反对党就一致要求吉田政府正式公布“保安厅”长官木村笃太郎在六月九日透露的“五年防卫计划”的具体内容。但是，吉田一直不敢宣布这个已受到日本舆论激烈反对的重整军备计划。七月八日，属于主张公开重整军备的改进党的众议员川崎秀二在众议院预算委员会上以“个人资格”宣布了一份“国务相木村笃太郎五年防卫计划的资料”，这份“资料”的宣布使企图借隐瞒重整军备来逃避日本人民的谴责的吉田政府哑口无言，狼狈不堪。
    川崎宣布的“资料”包含甲、乙两个重整军备草案。前者是美国当局和日本前海陆军人联合草拟的，后者是日本“保安厅”草拟的。“甲案”规定建立一支由二千六百三十七架飞机（其中九百五十四架是喷气式）组成的空军，和一支总共三十四万吨的海军。“乙案”所规定建立的海、空军恰和木村在六月九日透露的相同。川崎没有透露两个草案中关于扩充陆军的数字。但是就在川崎宣布这两个重整军备草案的第二天——九日，美国国务卿杜勒斯向美国参议院拨款委员会说：“在目前正待日本国会批准的本会计年度预算草案中，日本政府已拨出了足以将它的保安队增加到十个师的款项。”日本“保安队”的实力目前相当于五个师。
    川崎在宣布吉田政府这两个重整军备草案时说：“政府所以不愿宣布它的防卫计划，不仅是由于它的地位还不巩固，而且是由于吉田首相的逐渐增加日本防卫力的方案要到一九五四—一九五五会计年度的前期才达到它的极限。到那时，国家保安队就必须要拥有成为一支现代化陆军的装备了。”川崎承认：这两个草案是“为了日本接受美国“共同安全署”援助而草拟的”。
