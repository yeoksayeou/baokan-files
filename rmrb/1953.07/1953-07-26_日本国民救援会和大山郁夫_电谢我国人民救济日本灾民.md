Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Following the severe floods in Kyushu and other areas of Japan in late June, Tatsuji Fuse, Chairman of the Japanese National Relief Association, sent a letter to Soong Ching Ling, Chairman of the Chinese People's Relief Association, requesting assistance for the flood victims in Kyushu, Japan. Upon receiving this letter, our Chinese People's Relief Association immediately began raising disaster relief funds and, on July 20th, remitted 1,236,470,000 RMB (approximately 18 million Japanese Yen) to the Japanese National Relief Association for distribution to the affected people in Japan. This profound concern of the Chinese people for the Japanese disaster victims has evoked heartfelt gratitude from the Japanese people. The Japanese National Relief Association and Japanese public figure Ikuo Oyama have successively telegraphed the Chinese People's Relief Association, expressing their sincere gratitude for the charitable actions of the Chinese people.
