    Building a Bountiful Mountain Area
    —An Account of Communist Party Member Wang Yonghuai's Deeds
    Xiao Feng
    Communist Party member Wang Yonghuai, currently serving as the Deputy County Head of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, and concurrently as the Head of the Seventh District, is a model worker in leading mountain area construction.

    After the national victory of the revolution, while some cadres were being transferred from rural areas to work in cities, Wang Yonghuai was sent by the Xingtai County People's Government to the Seventh District—at the foot of the Taihang Mountains—to serve as the District Head. At the time, people with personal agendas speculated, "Wang Yonghuai made a mistake and was sent back to work in the mountain area." Wang Yonghuai didn't think that way. He happily carried his luggage and bag, traversing mountains whether in severe winter or scorching summer, day or night, to work in various villages. Moreover, he often explained the morals and qualities that Communist Party members should possess to district and village cadres, encouraging everyone to dedicate themselves to the construction of the mountain area, leading the mountain people to increase grain production, breed livestock, and transform barren mountains into bountiful forests.

    Certainly Able to Increase Grain Production Even More
    Can the mountain area increase grain production even more? This is the first concrete question in building the mountain area. Although many activists and labor models said, "Yes!" and also made production increase plans; most farmers said, "Increase production, who wouldn't want that? But you have to come up with a way to increase production!" Wherever Wang Yonghuai went, the farmers in that village would ask him for a way to increase production. This made him feel that although he had led agricultural production for these years, he didn't have much knowledge of agricultural production. He thought, "If I don't understand, I don't understand, I have to study diligently!" Just then, the Hebei Provincial People's Government was training farm managers and agricultural section chiefs from various counties in the Xingtai Special District, and Wang Yonghuai requested to go to the training class, hoping to learn some ways to lead agricultural production from it.

    After Wang Yonghuai returned from the training class, he had confidence and methods for leading mountain area construction. One day, Wang Yonghuai went to work at the Shuimen Village Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Production Cooperative. The members were preparing to sow corn. After Wang Yonghuai understood the row spacing, number of plants, and cultivation and fertilization methods they used to sow corn last year, he compared them with the new methods he had learned and found that the number of plants planted was too small and should be increased by one to two times; the ground was also plowed too shallow and should be plowed to a depth of one foot; in terms of fertilization, in addition to applying base fertilizer, topdressing should also be applied three times. Wang Yonghuai raised these issues. Wang Junsheng, a labor model who attended the provincial agricultural labor model conference, strongly agreed with Wang Yonghuai's opinion and persuaded everyone to accept Wang Yonghuai's opinion. However, when it came to applying the third topdressing, the technical team leader, Feng Tianliang, couldn't command the cooperative members. Because the cooperative members felt that the planting was too dense and too much fertilizer was being applied. If only stalks grew and no corn grew, wouldn't the fertilizer and labor be wasted? At this time, Wang Yonghuai rushed to Shuimen Village to explain to them the scientific principle that bran and bone meal can be used as fertilizer, explaining that bone fertilizer is a good fertilizer for growing grains. Without these fertilizers, the harvest would be reduced. The cooperative members reluctantly applied the topdressing. In the autumn harvest, although the corn suffered a wind disaster, it still yielded more than 1,100 catties per mu. The cooperative members said happily, "That's great! Let's plant according to this method. Next year, we'll definitely be able to harvest 1,500 catties per mu." In order to promote this cultivation method throughout the district, Wang Yonghuai organized farmers from various villages to visit and learn from Shuimen Village.

    When sowing winter wheat, Wang Yonghuai went to the Wang Huailan Production Cooperative in Xiadian Village to introduce the dense planting cultivation method for wheat. Wang Huailan is a Communist Party member and a labor model, and has always listened to the instructions of his superiors, but he had some doubts about this dense planting method. He thought: in the past, each mu used three and a half sheng of seeds, but now it is changed to six and a half sheng, almost doubled. The planting is so dense and deep that the wheat will easily fall over and rot. After Wang Yonghuai discovered this, he immediately introduced him to the "169" wheat he had exchanged for from the special district farm, and told him that this wheat had stiff stalks, was not easy to fall over, and had a large yield. At the same time, he explained to him that dense planting is not about squeezing the seeds together, but about widening the sowing width and row spacing. Although there are more seeds, they are evenly dispersed. Wang Huailan's concerns were dispelled, but the cooperative members still held a skeptical attitude. Because everyone had too many concerns, it was decided to experiment on the land of cooperative member Li Qingxiang first. In the second spring, when the wheat seedlings were a foot high, they were strong and dark green. But some people still said, "Don't look at how good it is now, when it's time to bloom and fill the grains, it'll fall over with a gust of wind, and won't it crush the green manure!" When the wheat was filling the grains, it didn't fall over with one wind, or two winds, and although the third rainstorm blew down some of it, many of them stood up again after the weather cleared. When the wheat was about to be harvested, Wang Yonghuai organized people from various villages to visit. The visitors unanimously praised: the wheat ears were uniform, the grains were numerous, and they looked like they were piled up. As a result, each mu of wheat yielded 718 catties and 12 taels. Some cooperative members said regretfully, "If I had known that the dense planting method was so good, let alone planting all of it into dense planting wheat, even planting half of it would have yielded so much that there would be no place to put it." When Wang Yonghuai and the people were chatting in front of the temple in Xiadian Village, everyone expressed that they would plant 60 mu of densely planted "169" wheat this year, and they must achieve deep plowing and more fertilization.

    The facts of increased production in the Wang Huailan Production Cooperative in Xiadian Village and the Wang Junsheng Production Cooperative in Shuimen Village educated the cooperative members and other farmers, making everyone believe that Wang Yonghuai's method of increasing grain production was correct.

    Wang Yonghuai summarized and promoted advanced cultivation experiences according to different seasons and local conditions. Now, farmers in the whole district believe that it is no longer considered a high yield to harvest 700 to 800 catties of miscellaneous grains per mu, and 500 to 600 catties of wheat per mu (irrigated land). The production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various villages are planning to comprehensively promote dense planting and phased fertilization, and everyone has confidence in increasing grain production even more in the mountain area.

    Afforestation is Not Difficult, and Protecting Forests is Not Difficult Either
    In the Seventh District of Xingtai, afforestation has become a mass movement. In the autumn of last year alone, more than 30,000 mu of timber trees, and more than 10,000 mu of fruit trees such as chestnuts and walnuts were planted, more than double the total amount of afforestation in 1950 and 1951. The work was not all smooth sailing. District and village cadres once said, "Afforestation is difficult, and protecting forests is even more difficult."

    Afforestation and tree planting do not yield immediate benefits, and in addition, everyone's understanding of the future of social development is not thorough. Thinking that socialism will soon be implemented and trees will be nationalized, so they are unwilling to afforest and plant trees. After Wang Yonghuai understood this situation, he first patiently helped everyone recognize the benefits of afforestation. In addition to conducting general political education, Wang Yonghuai paid special attention to educating farmers with facts. Yao Lianjun from Zhehu Village planted more than 700 chestnut trees and more than 30,000 apricot, pear, toon, and elm trees in a small valley. He can earn more than 7,000 catties of millet every year. When the district government held a village-level cadre meeting, Wang Yonghuai specially invited Yao Lianjun to report on his experience of benefiting from tree planting. Yao Lianjun's report not only allowed everyone to learn general afforestation knowledge, but also understood the need to use the typical experiences of their own village to promote the afforestation movement in their own village. Later, Wang Yonghuai solved the problems of profit sharing and work point recording in the afforestation of the Shuimen Village Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Production Cooperative. The large-scale planned afforestation movement in the district was further developed, and various production cooperatives and mutual aid teams cultivated a certain number of seedlings and organized the labor force to transplant them on time.

    After the afforestation movement was launched throughout the district, a new
    problem was raised to the leaders, which was how to protect the forests. Once, people from Jiangshui Town went to the mountainside of Shuimen Village to collect firewood and cut down many small trees. The people of Shuimen
    Village wanted to send the firewood cutters to the district government. The people of Jiangshui Town were very angry. They said, "The people of Shuimen Village are so domineering that they won't even let us cut firewood." These opinions were reflected to Wang Yonghuai. Wang Yonghuai
    After investigation, he learned that the people of Jiangshui Town did not know that Shuimen Village had
    a forest protection pact, so they cut down trees and shrubs together as they had done in the past. Wang Yonghuai thought: forest protection work must be done together by everyone. He educated the masses in the two villages, convened a joint village forest protection
    meeting, and formulated a joint village forest protection pact. From then on, the masses in each village knew very well which mountain was afforested and could not be used for firewood, which mountain could still be used for firewood, and what kind of firewood they could cut. They no longer cut down trees.

    The more forests are planted, the more mountains are closed, and conflicts arise with shepherds. The shepherds said, "If you want to raise sheep, don't close the mountains. If you close the mountains, where will we graze the sheep?" Sometimes, the sheep ate the seedlings. When the farmers saw that the sheep had eaten the seedlings, they clamored, "Whoever's sheep ate our seedlings, they have to replant them for me." After studying the seasonal patterns of grazing, Wang Yonghuai proposed: in the summer, put the sheep in the deep mountains, so that they will not eat the grass on the local slopes. This can both protect the forests and seal these slopes as "grass reserves" to allow the grass to grow thicker. In late autumn, after the sheep return from the deep mountains, open the "grass reserves" again. At this time, the saplings have grown to four or five feet high, the leaves have fallen, and the sheep will not eat the trees. In order to ensure that grazing is carried out in a planned manner, Wang Yonghuai also led everyone to allocate grass slopes according to the number of sheep in each village, and each village was responsible for their own management, prohibiting random grazing, and solving the difficulty of insufficient grass sources.

    Found a Way to Develop Animal Husbandry
    Vigorously developing animal husbandry is one of the guiding principles for building mountain areas. This year, the People's Government issued more than 300 million yuan in animal husbandry loans to the Seventh District. In the past, the animal husbandry work in this area was not done well, and the death rate of sheep was very serious. Taking this year as an example, five or six hundred sheep died in more than 70 villages in the district. More than 80 sheep died in Shuimen Village, more than 90 in Liziping, and 30 to 40 each in Jiangshui Town and Hujialou. This loss made Wang Yonghuai very anxious. In order to find a solution to this problem, Wang Yonghuai talked with the shepherds in various villages. Everyone said that Feng Changfu of Lizike had particularly extensive experience in shepherding. Wang Yonghuai found Feng Changfu. Feng Changfu was already 59 years old and had been shepherding since he was 13 years old. He talked with Wang Yonghuai for several hours. Starting from how to herd sheep in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons, he talked about "setting lambs," raising lambs, and the prevention and treatment of various sheep diseases, explaining everything clearly and systematically. Wang Yonghuai thought: before there is scientific sheep raising technology, summarizing and promoting existing sheep raising experience is an important method for developing animal husbandry at present. So Wang Yonghuai convened a symposium for cattle and sheep herders, where Feng Changfu introduced his sheep herding experience and everyone discussed and supplemented it. At the same time, he strengthened the education of cattle and sheep herders, which significantly improved their understanding of mountain area construction. In addition, Wang Yonghuai also helped the Shuimen Village Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Production Cooperative formulate a reward method for sheep herders, stipulating that prizes would be awarded once per season. After this series of specific measures, the mountain area's animal husbandry industry developed.

    The Mountain Area Has Changed Its Old Appearance
    Under the leadership of Comrade Wang Yonghuai, and through the hard work of the masses in the Seventh District of Xingtai, the mountain area has changed its old appearance. The saplings sown on tens of thousands of acres of barren mountains sway in the wind. Compared with the past scene of mountains full of sand and stones, these saplings are even more lovable. Chestnut trees in the mountains are blooming with white flowers, and walnut trees and persimmon trees are also full of plump fruits. The number of sheep in the district has developed to more than 40,000, and groups of them graze on the lush green grass on the hillsides. The total grain output of the district increased by 29.3 percent in 1952 compared with 1951, and cotton production increased by 45 percent, earning the title of "bumper harvest area." This is a victory for the Party and the People's Government's policy of building mountain areas, and Comrade Wang Yonghuai is an active implementer of the Party and the government's policy of building mountain areas.

    1953 is the first year of the country's first five-year construction plan. Comrade Wang Yonghuai and the comrades of the Seventh District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Xingtai County have also formulated a five-year plan to link their work with the country's economic construction. For example, within five years, 440,000 mu of various seedlings will be sown, the number of sheep will increase to 100,000, and the number of grain production increases has been stipulated. Wang Yonghuai and the cadres and masses of the entire district firmly believe that this plan can be achieved and must be achieved.

    Wang Yonghuai's long-term and faithful work for the Party and the people has earned him the respect and love of the people. In 1951, the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference awarded him the title of "Model District Head." In October 1952, at the Xingtai County People's Congress, he was honorably elected as the Deputy County Head of the County People's Government. These things only educated Wang Yonghuai to recognize that his responsibility is even greater; he must strengthen theoretical study, overcome shortcomings, unite the cadres of the entire district to work together, and better complete the tasks of the Party.

    建设丰饶的山区
    ——记共产党员王永淮的事迹
    肖峰
    共产党员王永淮，现任河北省邢台县人民政府副县长兼第七区区长，是领导山区建设的模范工作者。
    革命在全国胜利以后，正当有一部分干部从农村转入城市工作的时候，王永淮却被邢台县人民政府派到七区——太行山麓去当区长。当时抱有个人打算的人，就猜测着说：“王永淮犯了错误，又被派回山区工作了。”王永淮却没有这样想，而是高高兴兴地背着行李，带着挂包，不管是严冬酷夏，不管是黑夜白天，翻山越岭到各村工作。而且他还经常对区、村干部讲解共产党员应有的道德和品质，鼓励大家安心从事山区的建设，领导山区人民增产粮食，繁殖牲畜，使荒山变成丰饶的林园。
    一定能够更多地增产粮食
    山区能更多地增产粮食吗？这是建设山区的第一个具体问题。虽然许多积极分子和劳动模范们说：“能！”并且也作出了增产计划；但是一般农民却说：“增产，谁不愿意哩？你可拿出增产的办法来呀！”王永淮走到那村，那村的农民就向他要增产的办法。使他感觉到，虽然自己领导了这些年的农业生产，但是对农业生产的知识并不多。他想“不懂就是不懂，要认真学习呀！”恰好这时，河北省人民政府在邢台专区训练各县农场场长和农业科长，王永淮就要求到训练班去学习，希望由此学会一些领导农业生产的办法。
    王永淮从训练班回来后，对领导山区建设有了信心，也有了办法。有一天，王永淮到水门村农林畜牧生产合作社去工作，社员们正准备播种玉茭。王永淮了解了他们去年播种玉茭的行距、棵数和耕作、施肥的方法等情况以后，就和学来的新办法相对照，发现种的棵数太少，应增多一倍到两倍；地刨的也太浅，应刨深到一尺；在施肥方面，除了施底肥外，还应上追肥三次。王永淮就把这些问题提出来。王俊生是出席省农业劳动模范大会的劳动模范，他很同意王永淮的意见，而且劝说大家接受了王永淮的意见。但当第三次上追肥时，技术组长冯天亮却指挥不动社员了。因为社员们觉得种的太密，施肥又多，如果光长杆子不长玉茭，不是白搭上肥料和人工了吗？这时，王永淮就赶到水门村，对他们讲解糠和骨粉可以作肥料的科学道理，说明骨肥是长籽粒的好肥料，不施这些肥料，就会减少收成。社员们就勉强上了追肥。秋收时，玉茭虽然遭受了一场风灾，但每亩仍打了一千一百多斤。社员们都高兴地说：“真好！按着这办法种吧，明年每亩准能打一千五百斤。”王永淮为了在全区推广这种耕作法，就组织各村农民到水门村去参观和学习。
    播种冬小麦的时候，王永淮又到了下店村王怀兰生产合作社里，向王怀兰生产合作社介绍小麦密植耕作法。王怀兰是个共产党员，又是个劳动模范，向来是听信上级的话的，但是对这个密植法却有些怀疑。他想：过去每亩用种籽三升半，现在改为六升半，几乎多了一倍，播种的又密又深，麦子长起来容易倒和霉烂。王永淮发现后，立即介绍他到专区农场换来了“一六九”小麦，并告诉他这种小麦杆硬，不易倒，而且产量大。同时又向他解释，密植不是把种籽挤在一起，是要加宽播幅和行距，种籽虽多，但分散的均匀。王怀兰的顾虑打消了，可是社员们仍持怀疑的态度。由于大家顾虑太多，便决定先在社员李庆祥的地里作试验。第二年春天，麦苗一尺高时，黑绿黑绿的挺壮实。但是还有人说：“别看现在这么好，等吐穗灌粒的时候，一刮风就倒了，还不压了绿肥！”麦子灌粒了，一场风没吹倒，两场风也没吹倒，第三场风雨虽然吹倒了一些，但天晴以后，又立起来了很多。麦子将要收割时，王永淮就组织各村的人去参观。参观的人们一致称赞：麦穗齐，麦粒多，像堆起来的一样。结果，每亩麦子打了七百一十八斤十二两。有的社员后悔地说：“早知道密植法这样好，别说都种成密植麦子，就是种一半也打的没处放了。”王永淮和人们在下店村的庙前漫谈时，大家表示今年要种六十亩密植的“一六九”小麦，并且一定要作到深耕和多施肥。
    下店村王怀兰生产合作社和水门村王俊生生产合作社的增产事实教育了社员，也教育了其他农民，使大家相信了王永淮指出的增产粮食办法是对的。
    王永淮就这样按照不同的季节和当地的具体情况，总结和推广了先进的耕作经验。现在，全区农民认为杂粮每亩能收七八百斤，小麦每亩能收五六百斤（水地）已不算是高产量了。各村的生产合作社、互助组，都计划着全面推广密植和分期施肥等耕作法，大家对山区更多地增产粮食有了信心。
    造林不难，护林也不难
    在邢台七区，造林已经成为群众性的运动。只去年秋季，就播种木材树三万多亩，栗子、核桃等果树一万多亩，比一九五零和一九五一两年的造林总数还多一倍。在进行这个工作时也不是一帆风顺的，区村干部曾说：“造林难，护林更难。”
    造林植树不能马上获利，再加上大家对社会发展前途不十分了解，以为不久就要实行社会主义，树木就要归公，所以都不愿造林植树。王永淮了解这一情况后，首先耐心地使大家认识造林的好处。王永淮除了进行一般的政治教育外，特别注意用事实去教育农民。折虎村有个姚连君，在一个小山凹里种了七百多棵栗树，三万多棵杏树、梨树、椿树、榆树等。每年可以收入七千多斤小米。区政府在召开村级干部会议时，王永淮特别请了姚连君去报告他植树得利的经过。姚连君的报告不仅使大家学到了一般的造林常识，而且懂得了要用本村的典型经验来推动本村的造林运动。以后，王永淮又在水门村农林畜牧生产合作社，解决了造林中的分红、记工等问题，全区有计划的大规模的造林运动就进一步开展起来，各个生产合作社、互助组，都培育了一定数量的树苗，并且组织好劳动力，作到了按时移栽。
    造林运动在全区展开后，在领导面前提出了新的
    问题，就是怎样护林的问题。有一次，浆水镇的人到水门村的山坡上去打柴，砍了不少的小树。水门
    村的人要把砍柴的人送到区政府去。浆水镇的人却很气愤，他们说：“水门村的人们真霸道，连柴也
    不让砍了。”这些意见反映到王永淮那里。王永淮
    经过调查，了解了浆水镇的人因为不知道水门村有
    护林公约，因而还和过去一样地不管是树木是荆条
    都一齐砍。王永淮想：护林工作必须大家一齐来
    作。他对两村的群众进行了教育，召开了联村护林
    会，制订了联村护林公约，从此各村群众对于那座
    山造了林，就不能打柴，那座山还可以打柴，打什么柴等问题，都知道的很清楚，不再砍树了。
    造的林多，封的山也就多，就和放羊的发生了矛盾。羊工们说：“要养羊，就别封山，封了山，到那里去放羊。”有时，羊就吃了树苗。农民们见羊吃了树苗，就吵嚷起来：“谁的羊吃了我们的树苗，谁就给我补种。”王永淮研究了放羊的季节规律后，提出：夏天把羊放到深山去，可以不吃本地坡上的草，这样既可以护林，又可以把这些坡封为“草库”，让草长的更肥。秋末，羊从深山回来以后，再开放“草库”，这时小树已长到四五尺高，叶落了，羊也就不会吃树了。为了使放牧有计划地进行，王永淮又领导大家按各村羊的数目，分配草坡，各自保管，不许乱放，解决了草源不足的困难。
    找到了发展畜牧的办法
    大力发展畜牧，是建设山区的方针之一。人民政府今年给七区发放畜牧贷款达三亿多元。过去，这个地区的畜牧工作作得不好，羊的死亡现象非常严重。以今年为例，全区七十多个村，就死了五六百只羊。其中水门村就死了八十多只，栗子坪死了九十多只，浆水镇、胡家楼也都死了三四十只。这种损失，使王永淮非常焦急。为了寻找解决这一问题的办法，王永淮便和各村羊工去交谈，大家都说栗子坷冯常府放羊的经验特别多。王永淮找到了冯常府。冯常府已经五十九岁了，从十三岁就开始放羊，他和王永淮谈了好几个钟头。从春、夏、秋、冬四季如何放羊开始，一直谈到“定羔”，养羔，以及羊的各种疾病的预防和治疗等等，都谈的头头是道。王永淮想：在还没有科学的养羊技术以前，总结已有的放羊经验，加以推广，是目前发展畜牧的重要方法。于是王永淮召开了牛羊工座谈会，由冯常府介绍放羊经验，让大家讨论补充。同时加强了对牛羊工的教育，使牛羊工对山区建设的认识有了显著的提高。另外，王永淮又帮助水门村农林畜牧生产合作社制订了对羊工的奖励办法，规定每季评奖一次。经过这一系列的具体措施，山区畜牧事业发展起来了。
    山区改变了旧日的面貌
    邢台七区在王永淮同志的领导下，经过全区群众辛勤的经营，已改变了旧日的面貌。在数万亩荒山上播种的树苗，随风摇摆着，和过去满山砂石的景象相比，更觉得这些树苗的可爱。山里栗子树开着白花，核桃树、柿子树也都结满了肥硕的果子。全区羊群已发展到四万多只，一群群的在山坡上吃着肥美的青草。全区粮食的总产量，一九五二年比一九五一年提高了百分之二十九点三，棉花增产百分之四十五，得到了“丰产区”的称号。这是党和人民政府建设山区的政策的胜利，而王永淮同志，便是党和政府建设山区的政策的积极执行者。
    一九五三年是国家第一个五年建设计划开始的第一年。王永淮同中共邢台县第七区委员会的同志们，也制订了一个五年计划，使自己的工作和国家的经济建设联系起来。例如在五年内要播种各种树苗四十四万亩，羊发展到十万只，以及规定了增产粮食的数字。王永淮和全区的干部群众坚强地相信，这个计划是能够达到的，而且也一定要达到。
    王永淮为党为人民长期地忠实地工作，得到了人民的尊敬和热爱。一九五一年，河北省农业劳动模范大会赠予了他“模范区长”的称号。一九五二年十月，邢台县各界人民代表会上，他光荣地当选为县人民政府的副县长。这些只是教育王永淮认识到自己的责任更加重大；必须加强理论学习，克服缺点，团结全区干部共同努力，更好地完成党的任务。
