Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th dispatch: Moscow newspapers on the 11th extensively reported news of joint plenary sessions held by state and city committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union together with party activists, and meetings held by workers and staff across the country, expressing support for the decisions of the Party Central Committee's plenary session and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR published on the 10th. "Pravda" and "Izvestia" also published editorials on this matter. "Labor News", "Komsomolskaya Pravda", "Red Star" and other newspapers reprinted "Pravda's" editorial published on the 10th entitled "The Indestructible Unity of the Party, Government, and Soviet People".

	"Pravda" wrote in its editorial entitled "The Voice of the Party, the Voice of the People": News has come from all over the country about the plenary sessions held by party committees in Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, and other places together with party activists, as well as mass meetings of workers and staff, which vividly confirm the indestructible unity of the Party, Government, and Soviet people. The enthusiastic speeches and unanimously adopted resolutions are a manifestation of the unity of will between the Party and all Soviet people. Millions of Soviet people angrily condemn the crimes of Beria, the enemy of the Party and the people, and demand that revolutionary vigilance be heightened. "Pravda" pointed out: The joint plenary sessions of party organizations in Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, Minsk, and other cities, discussing the summary of the Party Central Committee's plenary session, strongly demonstrated the iron-like unity of the Party ranks, and the Party's close unity around its Central Committee. Party organizations at all levels and all Soviet people support the decision of the Central Committee's plenary session, and they will unite more closely around the Communist Party, the Party Central Committee, and the Soviet government, and redouble their efforts in the struggle to implement the policies formulated by the Party. The Soviet people, under the leadership and encouragement of the Communist Party, are devoting all their energy to peaceful construction, will more widely launch a competition to complete and overfulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and will strengthen the socialist motherland—the invincible fortress of world peace—by all means. The Soviet people, engaged in peaceful and constructive labor, vigilantly watch the conspiracies of the imperialists and their shameful hirelings, and resolutely rebuff the organizers of provocative incidents and adventurous actions. Our people are constantly strengthening their friendship with the great People's Republic of China and with all the People's Democracies. No force in the world can stop Soviet society from marching towards communism.

	"Izvestia's" editorial discussed the solidarity of the Soviet people. The editorial said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are confidently advancing along the road of building communism. The Soviet state is constantly achieving new results in developing the national economy and culture, and in further improving the material welfare of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals. These achievements inspire the Soviet people and motivate them to achieve new accomplishments. Due to the achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and the continuous growth of the strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, the imperialist reactionary groups are furious. The imperialists have adopted the most despicable and sinful actions to undermine the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Sending spies to carry out sabotage, plotting conspiracies, and carrying out provocations are the weapons of the heads of imperialist countries. The imperialists are attempting to gain the support of all kinds of degenerates and corrupt elements from the countries of the democratic and socialist camp, and they are strengthening the sabotage activities of their espionage personnel. "Izvestia" concluded by saying that the Soviet people are expressing their militant solidarity with their Communist Party and the Soviet government. Our cause is indestructible. The unbreakable unity of the Party, the government, and the people is the guarantee of constantly achieving brilliant victories in the struggle for the victory of communism.

    苏联各地党组织和人民痛斥贝利亚
    一致拥护党和政府的决定
    “真理报”和“消息报”就此发表社论
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十一日莫斯科各报，广泛报道苏联共产党各地州委员会、市委员会会同党活动分子举行联合全体会议，全国各地工人职员举行会议，表示拥护十日发表的党中央委员会全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决定的消息。“真理报”、“消息报”并就这事发表了社论。“劳动报”、“青年团真理报”、“红星报”等都转载了“真理报”十日发表的题为“党、政府、苏联人民的不可摧毁的团结”的社论。
    “真理报”在题为“党的声音，人民的声音”的社论里写道：从全国各地传来了关于莫斯科、基辅、列宁格勒和其他各地党委员会会同党的活动分子举行全体会议，以及工人职员举行大会的消息，这些消息生动地证实了党、政府、苏联人民的不可摧毁的团结。热烈的发言和一致通过的决议，是党和全体苏联人民意志一致的表现。千百万苏联人民愤怒地谴责党和人民的死敌贝利亚的罪行，要求提高革命警惕性。“真理报”指出：莫斯科、基辅、列宁格勒、明斯克和其他城市的党组织讨论党中央全体会议的总结的联合全体会议，强有力地表示了党的队伍钢铁般的团结，表示了党紧密地团结在自己的中央委员会的周围。各级党组织、全体苏联人民都拥护中央委员会全体会议的决定，他们将更紧密地团结在共产党、党的中央委员会和苏维埃政府的周围，将在争取实现党所制订的政策的斗争中加倍努力。共产党领导和鼓励下的苏联人民，把他们全部精力用在和平建设上，将更广泛地展开争取完成和提前完成第五个五年计划的竞赛，用一切办法加强社会主义祖国——世界和平不可战胜的堡垒——的力量。从事和平建设性劳动的苏联人民警惕地注视着帝国主义者和他们可耻雇佣者的阴谋，给予挑衅事件和冒险行动的组织者以坚决的反击。我国人民在不断地加强和伟大的中华人民共和国、和各人民民主国家的友谊。世界上没有任何力量能阻止苏维埃社会向共产主义迈进。
    “消息报”社论论述了苏维埃人民的团结一致。社论说，苏维埃人民在共产党的领导下，正在满怀信心地沿着建设共产主义的道路前进。苏维埃国家在发展国民经济与文化方面，在进一步提高工人、集体农民和知识分子的物质福利方面，不断获得新的成果。这些成果鼓舞着苏维埃人民，推动他们取得新的成就。由于苏联和人民民主国家的成就，由于和平、民主和社会主义阵营力量的不断增长，帝国主义反动集团暴跳如雷。帝国主义者采取了最卑鄙的罪恶行动，来破坏苏联和人民民主国家。派遣间谍进行破坏活动，制造阴谋，进行挑衅，这些就是帝国主义国家的头子们的武器。帝国主义者企图从民主和社会主义阵营的国家里取得各式各样的蜕化分子和腐化分子的支持，他们正在加强他们的间谍人员的破坏活动。“消息报”最后说，苏维埃人民正向他们共产党和苏维埃政府表示战斗的团结一致。我们的事业是不可摧毁的。党、政府和人民的牢不可破的团结是在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中不断取得光辉胜利的保证。
