    The French General Confederation of Labor's Influence Expands Among Working People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th] TASS reports: The recent elections for enterprise committees demonstrate that the French General Confederation of Labor's influence has greatly increased among the French working class and the broad masses of working people.
    According to the "Humanité" newspaper, in the branch plant of the American Ford Motor Company in Poissy, the candidates of the General Confederation of Labor obtained 71% of all votes, 3% more than in the last election. This gives them eleven out of the thirteen seats on the committee. In the Citroën automobile factory, 73.49% of all workers voted for the candidates of the General Confederation of Labor. The allocation of seats on the factory committee is as follows: fifteen representatives from the French General Confederation of Labor, one representative from the Catholic Labor Confederation, and one representative from the right-wing Social Democratic splinter union "Workers' Force."
    Recently, the French General Confederation of Labor achieved even more remarkable victories in the Renault automobile factory. In the election of worker representatives to the committee, all those elected were representatives of the General Confederation of Labor. In the election of staff, engineer, and technician representatives to the committee, the General Confederation of Labor also consolidated its position: it obtained 30.38% of the votes, 10.07% more than in the last election.
