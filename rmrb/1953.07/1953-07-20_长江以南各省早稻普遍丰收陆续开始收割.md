Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch:

    The early rice in the provinces south of the Yangtze River has generally had a bumper harvest this year and is being reaped successively. In Guangdong Province, with the exception of a small number of areas affected by floods that saw reduced production, most areas have had a bumper harvest. The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region and Jieyang County in the eastern Guangdong region and Zhongshan County in the central Guangdong region can increase early rice production by about 15% compared to last year. In the southern part of Guangxi Province and the southern part of Fujian Province, early rice production is generally expected to increase by more than 10% compared to last year. In the counties along the Jinsha River and Honghe River in Yunnan Province, early rice production is expected to increase by 20% to 30% compared to last year. In the eastern part of Hunan Province and the Dongting Lake plain, early rice production is generally expected to increase by about 10% compared to last year. Early rice production in Jiangxi Province is expected to increase by 5% to 7% compared to last year. In the main early rice producing areas of Zhejiang Province, such as the Jinhua, Wenzhou, and Taizhou regions, production is expected to increase by more than 10% compared to last year, with an average increase of 7% to 10% for the entire province.
    In order to increase grain production, the farmers in the rice-producing areas south of the Yangtze River have made great efforts. Many areas have promoted the advanced experiences of sparse sowing and close planting of rice. In areas along Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, areas along Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, and various areas in Guangxi Province, farmers actively built water conservancy projects, greatly expanding the planting area of early rice. Farmers in various regions fought against disasters such as waterlogging, drought, and insects in a timely manner, and paid attention to improving techniques such as weeding, fertilizing, and irrigating to prevent lodging of rice. In Zhejiang Province, when the early rice was developing tillers and ears, various places universally adopted local materials and used methods such as symposiums, field visits and comparisons, and typical demonstrations to promote local methods for preventing rice lodging. These have powerfully ensured the bumper harvest of early rice this year.

    长江以南各省早稻普遍丰收陆续开始收割
    【新华社十九日讯】长江以南各省今年早稻普遍丰收，正陆续开始收割。广东省早稻除小部分地区受水灾减产外，大部分地区获得丰收；海南黎族苗族自治区和粤东区揭阳县、粤中区中山县早稻都可比去年增产一成半左右。广西省南部和福建省南部早稻一般可比去年增产一成以上。云南省金沙江、红河沿岸各县早稻可比去年增产二成到三成。湖南省东部和洞庭湖滨平原早稻一般可比去年增产一成左右。江西省早稻可比去年增产百分之五到七。浙江省早稻主要产区金华、温州、台州等专区可比去年增产一成以上，全省平均可比去年增产百分之七到十。
    为了增产粮食，长江以南水稻产区农民曾作了很大努力。不少地区推行了水稻稀播、密植的先进经验。湖南省沿洞庭湖、江西省沿鄱阳湖和广西省各地，农民积极兴修水利，大大地扩大了早稻的种植面积。各地农民及时和水、旱、虫等灾害斗争，并注意改进耘耥、施肥、灌溉等技术，防止稻子倒伏。浙江省当早稻发棵孕穗时，各地普遍就地取材，运用座谈会、田间参观评比、典型示范等方式，推广了当地防止稻子倒伏的办法。这些都有力地保证了今年早稻的丰收。
