Since mid-May, Tsinghua University, Shandong University, Tianjin University, Guangxi University and other institutions of higher education have successively carried out mid-term teaching inspections.

In this mid-term teaching inspection, the schools focused on examining the problems existing in the teaching work from the implementation of the teaching plan, in order to continue to improve the teaching content, teaching methods, and improve the quality of teaching.

Judging from the inspection situation of Tsinghua University, Shandong University and other schools, since the implementation of planned teaching in various schools, they have achieved many results after two months of teaching practice. All schools can conduct lectures in accordance with the teaching syllabus and teaching calendar in teaching work, and have basically changed the chaotic state of aimlessness and planning in the past teaching work. They have also done a lot of work in improving the quality of teaching, improving the content of textbooks, improving teaching and tutoring methods, and improving classroom efficiency. In terms of learning from the Soviet Union's teaching experience in various subjects and cultivating and improving teachers, many teaching and research groups have also created some experiences and methods, and have achieved good results. For example, many newly-taught teachers in many departments of Tsinghua University, with the help of the teaching and research group, can mostly complete their teaching tasks.

This inspection proved that teaching and research groups that correctly exert collective strength can not only complete the teaching plan, but also consolidate themselves and truly become effective basic teaching organizations.

During this inspection, the schools also discovered some serious problems in the current teaching work:

First, the current study burden of students in various schools is too heavy, and the study time exceeds the original scheduled hours. Therefore, the learning results are difficult to consolidate. The development of students in learning is not comprehensive enough, which affects the quality of teaching and the completion of the teaching plan. This phenomenon is more prominent in industrial universities. For example, students in the Department of Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University generally study for 60 to 70 hours per week. Students are busy doing exercises and writing reports, and some do not even rest on Sundays. Students at Tianjin University feel that the content of many courses is not entirely appropriate: some courses have complex and numerous content, and some courses have content that is too deep and difficult to "digest." Similar phenomena also exist in comprehensive universities. For example, some teaching and research groups at Shandong University made excessive demands on students due to insufficient estimation of the actual situation when making plans, which made students' burdens too heavy. There are many reasons for these phenomena. For example, some teachers cannot fully consider the teaching effect, and only focus on teaching regardless of the students' ability to accept it. The tutoring work has not been improved at any time according to the students' learning situation. Teachers of various courses cannot cooperate well.

Second, the improvement of teaching work in some schools is relatively slow, and there is even a phenomenon of stagnation. The specific manifestation is that they have failed to complete the plan well, and even have a formalistic phenomenon in the implementation of the plan. For example, some teaching and research groups in Guangxi University had made plans at the beginning of the semester, and also held meetings on schedule during the semester, but each meeting only talked about some trivial matters, or spent most of the time listening to the reflections of the class representatives, and did not concentrate on researching and solving major problems in teaching work. Some teaching and research groups are organized by teachers who teach the same courses, but they still act independently in teaching work and do not care about each other. Some teaching and research groups at Shandong University only have general plans, and there are no specific steps and methods to implement the plans, so the plans often fail. Individual teaching and research groups, although they have made plans, the teachers do not actively try to implement the plans. Furthermore, professional teaching plans are tightly scheduled, and there is almost no time for maneuver in four years. The teaching objectives and requirements of some courses are not clear. The coordination and connection of various courses are not scientific. Once the situation changes slightly, the original plan has to be completely changed.

Third, some problems have also been discovered in the training of teachers. For example, the plan for training teachers is not specific enough, and lacks specific steps and methods. At the same time, the teaching assistants themselves lack initiative and do not work hard enough.

Through this inspection, the teaching and research groups in various schools have put forward many opinions and methods for improving the work. For example, in order to solve the problem of excessive homework burden on students, Tsinghua University put forward the slogan of "facing students, guaranteeing class hours, and improving quality", requiring teachers to carry out teaching according to the requirements of the course and the students' foundation, and use effective methods to help students develop independent thinking ability. It also called on the heads of various departments and teaching and research groups to check at any time and be responsible at all levels in order to improve the quality of teaching and complete the teaching plan. Shandong University, Tianjin University and other schools are preparing to revise the professional teaching plan and the teaching work plan for the next semester based on the problems discovered in the inspection.

### 清华大学等校检查教学工作中的问题

    清华大学等校检查教学工作中的问题
    五月中旬以来，清华大学、山东大学、天津大学、广西大学等高等学校先后进行了期中教学检查工作。
    此次期中教学检查，各校都是着重从教学计划执行的情况中，检查教学工作中存在的问题，以便继续改进教学内容、教学方法，提高教学质量。
    从清华大学、山东大学等校的检查情况来看，各校自实行计划教学以来，经过两个月的教学实践，获得了不少成绩。各校在教学工作上都能按教学大纲、教学日历进行授课，基本上改变了过去教学工作中无目的无计划的忙乱状态。在提高教学质量，改进教材内容，改善教学和辅导方法以及提高课堂效率方面，也做了不少工作。在学习苏联各科教学经验和培养、提高师资方面，许多教学研究组也创造了一些经验和办法，并收到良好的效果。例如，清华大学的许多系的许多新开课的教师，经过教学研究组的帮助，大多数都能完成教学任务。
    经过这次检查，证明了凡是正确地发挥集体力量的教学研究组，不仅可以完成教学计划，而且也使本身得到了巩固，真正成为有效的基本教学组织。
    在这次检查中，各校也发现了目前教学工作中的一些严重问题：
    第一，现在各校同学学习负担过重，学习时间都超过原定的学时，因此，学习成果难于巩固下来；同学在学习方面的发展也不够全面，因而影响了教学质量和教学计划的完成。这一现象在工业性质的大学表现得更为突出。例如清华大学土木系学生，每周学习时间一般都在六十小时至七十小时。学生们忙于做习题，写报告，有的连星期日也不休息。天津大学学生在学习中感到很多课程的内容不尽合适：有些课程的内容庞杂繁多，有些课程的内容太深，不易“消化”。在综合性大学中也有类似现象。如山东大学有些教学研究组订计划时因对实际情况的估计不足，对学生提出了过高的要求，使同学负担过重。产生这些现象的原因是很多的，例如有的教师不能全面地考虑教学效果，不管学生的接受能力如何，只顾教；而辅导工作又未能根据学生的学习情况，随时加以改进。各门课程的教师也不能很好地配合。
    第二，有些学校教学工作的改进比较缓慢，甚至有停滞不前的现象。具体的表现是，未能很好地完成计划，甚至在执行计划方面有流于形式的现象。例如广西大学的某些教学研究组，学期开始时曾订了计划，学期中也按期开了会，但每次会上只是漫谈一些琐屑的事情，或者以大部分的时间听听课代表的反映，并未集中力量研究和解决教学工作中的重大问题。有些教学研究组虽然是由教相同课程的教员组织起来的，但在教学工作上仍是各自为政，互不关心。山东大学有些教学研究组，只有一般的计划，没有实现计划的具体步骤和办法，因此计划往往落空；个别教学研究组，虽然订了计划，可是教师并不积极设法实现计划。再如专业教学计划，课程排得很紧，在四年中几乎找不到机动的时间；有些课程的教学目的、要求也不明确；各种课程的配合、联系也不科学，一旦情况稍有变动，就不得不全盘改变原订的计划。
    第三，在培养师资方面，也发现了一些问题。例如，培养师资的计划不够具体，缺乏具体步骤和办法。同时，助教本身也缺乏主动性，努力不够。
    通过这次检查，各校教学研究组都提出了很多改进工作的意见和办法。如清华大学为了解决学生功课负担过重的问题，提出了“面向同学，保证学时，提高质量”的口号，要求教师要根据课程的要求，同学的基础，来进行教学，用有效的方法帮助同学锻炼独立思考能力。并号召各系、各教学研究组的负责人，随时检查，层层负责，以提高教学质量，完成教学计划。山东大学、天津大学等校根据检查中所发现的问题，准备着手修改专业教学计划和下学期的教学工作计划。
