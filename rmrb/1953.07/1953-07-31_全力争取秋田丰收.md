Strive for a Bumper Autumn Harvest in Akita

Now is the most crucial moment to strive for a bumper autumn grain harvest. This year, natural disasters in late spring and early summer have already taken away a considerable amount of wheat and some rice. We must put forth all our strength to protect the autumn seedlings, overcome the attacks of pests, floods, typhoons, and droughts, and recover the losses already suffered from the autumn fields.

Many agricultural leading cadres and peasant masses in various regions have waged a resolute struggle against natural disasters and have done a lot of work to strive for increased grain production. The early rice in the southern provinces has already achieved a relatively good harvest. However, there has also been a phenomenon of tightening up at the beginning and then relaxing later in some areas. Some people believe that spring plowing and production are the overriding central task; once spring plowing is over, there is no need to be so "tense" anymore. They believe that although agricultural production is still the central task in rural areas, it is no longer the overriding one. This idea is wrong. The CCP Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation clearly states: "In rural areas, the overriding task is agricultural production work, and all other work revolves around agricultural production and serves it." It is clear that at any time, it is wrong not to put agricultural production in an overriding position in rural areas.

Now is the busiest and most urgent season for rural work. Summer weeding has not yet been completed, and many tasks such as pest control, topdressing, manure accumulation, irrigation, drainage, flood prevention, and preparation for autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting are urgently awaiting completion. Some areas are also simultaneously carrying out township division and pilot projects for universal suffrage. In this tense and busy situation, a slight carelessness can delay production and cause losses. Therefore, local leading organs must not only carry out township division and pilot projects for universal suffrage around agricultural production work, and insist on putting agricultural production in an overriding position at all times; but also, in agricultural production, they must grasp the major links that have the greatest impact. For example, the most vicious enemy of autumn crops in most parts of the country is the armyworm; when this insect is severely harmful, it can eat up large tracts of seedlings overnight. According to the general rule, the next generation of larvae it breeds around the Beginning of Autumn will cause even greater harm. Therefore, all areas where armyworms have occurred should regard pest control and autumn protection as the central task at present. In some areas, pest infestations have already become widespread, but local leading cadres are still deploying work in a general way. For example, in Jinbei District of Tianjin City, armyworms occurred in large numbers, and the masses demanded prevention and control. However, the local cadres in charge of production insisted on carrying out wheat appraisal and variety selection work according to the original plan, resulting in heavy losses to more than 12,000 mu of autumn crops, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. All localities should draw serious lessons from this. In the southern rice-producing areas, such as many areas in Hubei and Hunan provinces, drought has become a relatively serious threat; the ponds and dams washed away by rain need to be repaired urgently, and a democratic and rational water conservancy management system still needs to be universally established. In some areas of Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces, excessive rainfall has caused waterlogging, and it is urgent to make full use of human and mechanical drainage equipment to strengthen drainage work, and efforts should be made to implement water storage to prevent drought. In such areas, drought prevention and waterlogging prevention should be regarded as the central link in ensuring a bumper autumn harvest in the next month.

The main links in current agricultural production vary from place to place, and even within a county, different regions will vary. Local leading organs should carefully consider the local specific conditions and make reasonable arrangements for various tasks. The task of leaders is by no means merely to issue the call to "hurry up and protect the seedlings," but must always implement Chairman Mao's instructions in "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," combining general calls with specific guidance. At this critical juncture of production, the main leading cadres must specifically and directly grasp several key points, deeply implement the work of calling, break through one point, gain experience, and then use this experience to guide other units in a timely manner. Leading cadres must promptly understand the specific situation in production and earnestly help grassroots cadres and peasant masses solve all kinds of specific difficulties in terms of materials, technology, organization, and ideology.

The rural work in various regions is facing a decisive test. Whether the leader of a region has truly played a leading role depends on the results of conquering natural disasters and increasing grain production in the region. Rice and miscellaneous grains account for about 90 percent of China's total grain output; a bumper autumn grain harvest is of great significance for ensuring the smooth progress of national economic construction and the stability of people's lives. The Central Ministry of Agriculture has issued instructions to ensure the increased production of autumn crops, and all localities should ensure that these instructions are effectively implemented. Not only should the agricultural departments go all out to strive for victory in increasing the production of autumn grain; all departments related to rural work should also act in coordination and cooperate closely to strive for this victory.

### 全力争取秋田丰收

    全力争取秋田丰收
    现在正是争取秋粮丰收的最要紧的关头。今年春末夏初，自然灾害已经从我们手中夺去了不少麦子和一些稻子。我们必须拿出全部力量来保卫秋苗，战胜害虫、洪水、台风和干旱的侵袭，把已经遭受的损失从秋田中争回来。
    不少地区的农业领导干部和农民群众对自然灾害作了坚决的斗争，为争取增产粮食做了许多工作。南方各省的早稻已得到了较好的收成。但是，也有一些地方发生了前紧后松的现象。有些人认为：春耕生产是压倒一切的中心任务；春耕过去了，就不必再那么“紧张”了。他们认为现在农业生产虽然也还是农村的中心工作，但不是压倒一切的了。这种想法是不对的。中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议中明明写着：“在农村中压倒一切的工作是农业生产工作，其他工作都是围绕农业生产而为它服务的。”由此可见，任何时候，在农村中不把农业生产放在压倒一切的地位都是错误的。
    现在正是农村工作最繁忙最紧迫的季节。夏锄还没有完结，除虫、追肥、积肥、灌溉、排水、防汛、准备秋收秋耕秋种等许多工作都急待进行。有些地区还同时进行着划乡、普选试办等工作。在这种紧张、繁忙的情况下，稍不注意，就会耽误生产，造成损失。因此，各地领导机关不但要把划乡、普选试办等工作围绕农业生产工作来进行，坚持把农业生产经常放在压倒一切的地位；而且在农业生产中，又要抓住影响最为巨大的主要环节。例如，当前全国大部地区的大秋作物的最恶毒的敌人是粘虫；这种虫在为害严重的时候，能在一夜之间吃尽大片的禾苗。照一般的规律，它在立秋前后生殖的下一代幼虫，将会造成更大的危害。因此，凡是发生了粘虫的地区，就都应当把治虫保秋作为当前的中心工作。有些地区虫害已经普遍发生了，当地领导干部却仍然一般化地布置工作。如天津市津北区粘虫大量发生，群众要求防治，当地领导生产的干部却还坚持要按原先的布置进行小麦评比选种工作，结果使一万二千多亩秋禾遭受了重大损失，引起群众极大不满。各地都应该从这里吸取严重的教训。在南方水稻产区，如湖北、湖南等省的许多地区，干旱已经成为比较严重的威胁；被雨水冲垮的塘坝又亟须修复，民主的合理的水利管理制度还待普遍建立。安徽、江苏等省的一些地区，因雨水太多积成内涝，亟须充分利用人力的和机械的排水设备，加强排水工作，并应尽量实行蓄水防旱。在这样的一些地区，就应当把防旱、防涝作为今后一个月中保证秋田丰收的中心环节。
    各地当前农业生产中的主要环节是各不相同的，一县之内的不同地区也会各不相同。各地领导机关应当周密地考虑当地的具体条件，把各种工作合理地加以安排。领导者的任务决不是仅仅发出“赶快保苗”的号召，而必须时时刻刻实行毛主席在“关于领导方法的若干问题”中的指示，把一般号召和具体领导结合起来。在这生产的紧要关头，主要领导干部必须具体地直接地掌握若干基点，把号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后及时地利用这种经验去指导其他单位。领导干部必须及时地了解生产中的具体情况，切实帮助基层干部和农民群众解决物质上、技术上、组织上、思想上的种种具体困难问题。
    各地的农村工作正面临着决定性的考验。一个地区的领导者是不是真正起了领导作用，就看当地征服自然灾害和增产粮食的结果如何。水稻和杂粮约占我国粮食总产量的百分之九十；秋粮丰收对于保证国家经济建设的顺利进行和人民生活的安定有极重要的意义。中央农业部已经发出了保证大秋作物增产的指示，各地应保证这个指示能够切实执行。不但农业部门应当全力以赴，争取增产秋粮的胜利；一切与农村工作有关的部门也应当协同动作，密切配合，争取这个胜利。
