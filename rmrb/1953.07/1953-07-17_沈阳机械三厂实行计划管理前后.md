Shenyang Mechanical Plant No. 3 (hereinafter referred to as Plant No. 3) is a factory that produces machine tools. This type of machine tool is composed of more than nine hundred parts. The production of such a machine is like a complex long-distance journey organized by more than nine hundred people. Before the trip, these nine hundred people each need different preparations, take different roads, use various means of transportation, and finally need to arrive at the final destination at a prescribed time, where they are compiled into a whole. According to this procedure, Plant No. 3 produces several new machine tools every day.

The assembly workshop is the final point for these traveling teams. The machining workshops assemble thousands of parts made in proportion to each machine tool here into new machine tools.

The Ups and Downs of Feast and Famine

However, before the autumn of the year before last, if you walked into the assembly workshop of Plant No. 3 in the first ten days of each month, you would feel strange. At that time, the workshop was deserted and empty, the workers were listless, and many workers even had no work to do. Why was this the case? Because the parts supplied by the machining workshops were not complete, and assembly was impossible. Therefore, no matter how many machine tools the task for the month was to produce, not a single one could be assembled before the middle of the month. Generally, it was not until after the fifth day that the first few processes of the assembly workshop could slowly start moving. And by the last ten days of the month, the teams that should have arrived in batches suddenly flooded in, and the workshop was very crowded and lively at this time. In order to quickly assemble the finished products, without being told, the workers often secretly worked overtime. The leadership also often had to temporarily transfer people to help. At the most tense times, the workers stayed up all night, and the broadcasting system was still broadcasting music and songs in the middle of the night.

What was the situation for the quarter? It was also feast and famine. In the first two months of the second quarter of 1951, not a single machine tool was assembled. It was not until June that more than twenty machine tools were produced in a rush.

Who is Directing Production?

At that time, the real "director" of production was not the factory director, not the production section, but the assembly workshop and the "root-tracing bulletin."

In the first half of the month, the assembly workshop did not have much work to do, so the workshop cadres had to discuss and urge the parts everywhere. After the middle of the month, there were more and more parts. However, the parts did not come in the proportions required for each machine tool. And a machine tool could not be assembled if it was missing a single part. At this time, urging parts became the most stressful task for the assembly workshop cadres. They urged these today and those tomorrow, from the production section and machining workshops all the way to the raw material supply department and the sand casting and pattern workshop.

In order to help the assembly workshop urge parts, the Party's general branch committee and the trade union sponsored a "root-tracing bulletin." The "root-tracing bulletin's" blackboard stood at the factory gate, and the workers saw it the first thing they did when they came to work in the morning. The "root-tracing bulletin" depicted a worker in the assembly workshop, stretching out his hands and shouting: "We are stopped waiting for materials, you quickly send the following parts!" Below, the assembly workshop filled in the names of the parts they urgently needed every day. The parts written on the root-tracing bulletin became the most important task of the relevant workshop or section on that day.

At that time, each workshop was led by the production section. The production section was actually a "market" rather than an organization for directing production. You want parts, he wants materials, I want tools, everyone came to argue and urge. The production section neither understood the situation in the workshops nor had the authority to direct other sections, so it was naturally difficult to know exactly when these requirements could be met. They could only vaguely say "I'll give it to you tomorrow" or "I'll give it to you the day after tomorrow." This "market" could not solve the problem, so the big problems were always argued all the way up to the factory director, and the factory director had to follow everyone to urge parts and find tools every day. At that time, the factory held production meetings every day, at which everyone invariably argued red-faced for parts and raw materials. Xin Jingquan, the foreman of the original machining workshop, said it well: "At that time, we relied on our legs and mouths to do our work, and our brains couldn't move. Sometimes I thought of some problems, but they were immediately squeezed out by these patching things." At that time, the cadres' minds were filled with numbers (part codes), but if you asked how well everyone's tasks within the scope of their responsibilities were completed, or what problems there were in production, no one could answer.

Chaotic Machining Workshops

The machining workshops were not unwilling to meet the needs of the assembly workshop, but no one told them how to arrange the production of parts according to the needs of the assembly workshop. After the monthly production targets came down, they did whatever they had raw materials for, or they did more of the work that was easy to do and easy to get excess wages (the factory implemented piecework wages). As a result, some parts were machined in large quantities and piled up in the parts warehouse, while others were missing or not enough. After the "root-tracing bulletin" made a request, the machining workshop director, dispatcher, and foreman had to temporarily assign work to the workers. As a result, the work in the workers' hands had to be put down before it was finished, and they had to re-find tools and re-receive materials to do new ones. This new one had not yet been finished, and often another new part that was being urged more urgently was assigned. The lathes were often piled with half-finished work; it became common for difficult work to be assigned to small apprentices and simple work to be assigned to master craftsmen. As a result, man-hours were wasted, and the number of rejects increased. Workers complained when rejects were produced (affecting wage income), and some simply threw away the materials and tore up the work tickets, telling no one. Some work had just come out and was taken away before it could be registered and sent for inspection. The workshop cadres had no way of knowing how much raw material was put into the workshop, how many parts were produced, how many rejects there were, and how the in-process parts were flowing. The numbers recorded were different in the workshop, in the parts warehouse, and in the production section, and no one knew which one was correct. The workers did not know what to do tomorrow when they were doing this work today, and they did not know what to do next when they were doing this work. Even if they found shortcuts and learned advanced experiences, it was difficult to play a role.

Frequently Failed to Complete Tasks

The result of crash production was that the tasks were frequently not completed. From January to August 1951, the task of producing machine tools at Plant No. 3 was only 53 percent of the plan. As a result of crash production, equipment was frequently idle, man-hours were wasted seriously, overtime work caused wage overruns, the reject rate in production was very high, and money was lost every month. Wages were often paid with bank loans every month. Crash production completely ignored product quality. From January to August 1951, no first- or second-class products were produced at all. Third-class products accounted for 56 percent of all products, and the rest were substandard products with lead screw crosstalk, gear noise, or unqualified hardness.

The Root of the Chaos

Why did this chaotic situation arise? The key is that in Mechanical Plant No. 3, a very complex modern enterprise, there was no plan that could reflect the laws of production to guide and organize the entire enterprise's production activities. In blind activities, people could not foresee the problems in the development of things, and they could not but be dominated by many unexpected problems and become busy and passive, and even completely fall into chaos.

Mechanical Plant No. 3 is a factory with a very complex production process. The more than nine hundred parts required for each lathe are large and small, simple and complex, adding up to more than seven thousand processes and more than three thousand major and auxiliary raw materials. Except for a very small number supplied by brother factories, these parts all need to be cast, forged, machined, and then assembled. For such a complex enterprise, the management cadres of Plant No. 3 in the past did not use scientific organizational work and planning work, but relied on "roughly" and "about" "estimates" to carry out management. At the end of each month, the section in charge of planning roughly calculated the labor productivity of the workshop workers and the capacity of the machinery and equipment, and estimated that it was about the same, and then determined the plan for the next month. When should raw materials be put in, when should casting and forging be done, when should machining be done, when should assembly be done, how many parts should be occupied between processes, how many parts should be reserved in the parts warehouse, etc., the management cadres neither knew nor calculated. Originally, the production process of a machine tool required more than two months, but Plant No. 3 always blindly made a plan for the current month and wanted products in the current month. At that time, Plant No. 3 only had a plan for how many machine tools to produce in a month, and no one cared about the daily progress and mutual coordination of each workshop, even each work section and team. Therefore, although there was a plan every month, the specific production activities were still blind and unorganized.

The Operation Plan Organizes the Activities of the Entire Enterprise

I came to Mechanical Plant No. 3 in early May this year. It was the beginning of the month, but the assembly workshop was no longer the deserted place it used to be. From the first process to the last process, the workers were operating intensely. Here, the headstock and bed legs were being assembled... there, the lathe had already stood up, and at the end of the workshop, the workers were spraying these qualified lathes with blue-gray paint. The paint had dried, and the workers were packing them into the warehouse. Production was like flowing water, with the back wave pushing the front wave. Parts were constantly entering the workshop on one side, and lathes were constantly entering the warehouse according to plan on the other side. The assembly workshop's feast and famine had stopped happening.

This is a huge change, and this change began in August 1951.

In August 1951, the management cadres of Plant No. 3 seriously studied the Soviet advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts." The plan for each month was very specific, even specifying the workshop, work section, team, workers, and related sections. Progress was arranged on a daily basis, operation plans were made, and various instruction charts were established. As the operation plans and various charts became simpler to more complex and from rough to refined, the blindness in production gradually decreased.

The operation plan orderly planned out the complex production process. According to the needs of assembling a lathe, it stipulates when to prepare raw materials, when to do pre-production preparations, when the machining workshop should start machining, which parts should be machined by which people on which machine tools, and when the parts should arrive at the parts warehouse, etc. The planned progress is made into charts, and each production unit can follow the schedule indicated by this chart. If there is a distance between the red and blue lines on the chart, people will immediately take measures to solve it to avoid the next process from stopping and waiting for materials. Every week and every month, each workshop must also check the implementation of the operation plan, so as to improve the operation plan and at the same time discover the weak links in production, which should be solved as key issues in the next month. With a plan and a grasp of the implementation of the plan, people are no longer chased around by various sudden problems and become busy and overwhelmed, but instead discover and solve various problems in a planned and step-by-step manner.

A comrade who had just been transferred from another machine factory to Plant No. 3 said that after arriving at Plant No. 3 and comparing it with the original factory, he immediately felt that the headquarters of Plant No. 3 was more relaxed, and the workshop was busy but not chaotic. He said that the factory director of that factory could only do two or three tenths of the things he planned to do every day at most. The factory director here can handle seven or eight tenths of his plans every day, without so much downtime waiting for materials, and without so many "three-no-care" problems to entangle him. Looking at the activities of this factory in a day, you can know that this is true. Every morning, all cadres have two hours of cultural, theoretical, political, or technical learning. Cadres above section chiefs and workshop directors also have to study business for another hour. Then, the workshops and sections check the progress of the previous day separately. According to the problems shown in the charts, the workshop director, workshop dispatcher, etc. go to the workshop to understand the situation and check the reasons for the incomplete progress. From 10:30 to 11:30 in the morning, the workshop holds a dispatch meeting to solve the problems that occurred the previous day and prepare to participate in the factory's dispatch meeting. In the afternoon, the production section holds a factory-wide dispatch meeting to solve the progress and related issues of the entire factory. Now this meeting is not only held very quickly (one hour), but also no longer argues. After this meeting, in addition to some daily administrative affairs, everyone can use the afternoon to study problems and solve problems. When I arrived at the second machining workshop, the workshop director said that they were trying to break through the weak link of insufficient crane use, which was affecting production. When I arrived at the assembly workshop, they were considering shortening the production cycle and other issues. Problems occurring in each link are being considered and resolved by someone in a timely manner. Factory directors and other leading cadres have greatly freed themselves from the entanglement of daily affairs. Although too many meetings are still a big burden, there is already considerable time to consider the key issues related to the further progress of the entire enterprise in each period.

When discussing the plan every month, each worker has reasonably arranged his daily production activities for the month, and the situation of not knowing what to do tomorrow no longer exists. Now, if the targets for a month are issued a little late, the workers will actively urge the cadres, and they will no longer blindly produce. In addition, the labor organization has been changed, and labor specialization has been implemented, and everyone's enthusiasm for learning technology and finding shortcuts has greatly increased. In the past, the work that second- and third-level technicians had to do can now be done by apprentices who have only studied for four or five months. Labor productivity in 1952 increased by 89 percent compared to 1951.

Released Huge Potential

Planned management has released the huge potential of Plant No. 3. In 1952, the output of Plant No. 3 increased by 2.39 times compared to 1951 (the manpower and equipment basically did not increase); the total output value increased by 90 percent compared to 1951. Product quality has also improved significantly. Third-class products were eliminated in January 1952, and second-class products were eliminated in November. The cost of products was also reduced by 5.57 percent. Mechanical Plant No. 3 has changed from a factory with crash production and frequent failure to complete tasks to a factory that evenly overfulfills tasks.

    沈阳机械三厂实行计划管理前后
    宋琤
    沈阳机械三厂（下简称三厂）是一个生产工作母机的工厂。这种工作母机是由九百多种零件组成的。这样一台机器的生产，正像由九百多人组织的复杂的长途旅行者一样。这九百多人行前各自需要不同的准备工作，各自经过不同的道路，运用各种不同的交通工具，最后又需要在一个规定的时间到达总目的地，在这里编成一个整体。就按照这样的程序，三厂每天要出产好几台新机床。
    装配车间是这些旅行队伍的终点。加工车间按照每台机床的需要，把按比例做成的成千上万的零件在这里装配成新机床。
    前松后紧的冷热病
    但是，前年秋天以前，假使你在每月的上旬走进三厂的装配车间，你一定会感到奇怪。那时候，车间里冷冷清清、空空荡荡，工人们没精打采的，很多工人甚至没活干。为什么会是这样呢？因为加工车间供应的零件不齐备，无法装配。因此不管这个月的任务是生产多少台机床，月中以前总归装不出一台来。一般，总要到五日以后，装配车间的头几道工序才能慢慢地活动起来。而到了下旬，应该分批到达的队伍又一下子涌来了，车间里这时就十分拥挤热闹。为了赶快装出成品，不用号召，工人们也常常偷偷地加班加点。领导方面也常常要临时调人来帮忙。最紧张的时候，工人们连夜不睡，半夜里播音器还在放送着音乐歌曲。
    季度的情况如何呢？也是前松后紧。一九五一年第二季度的前两个月就没有装出一台床子来，直到六月份，才突击出二十几台机床。
    谁在指挥生产
    那时候，真正“指挥”生产的不是厂长、不是生产科，而是装配车间和“追根报”。
    上半个月，装配车间没有多少活做，车间干部就得到处商量催问零件。月中以后，零件越来越多了。但是，零件并不是按照每台机床所需要的比例而来的。而一台机床却是缺少一个零件也装不起来。这时，催零件就成了装配车间干部最紧张的任务，今天催这些，明天催那些，从生产科加工车间一直催到原材料供应部门和翻砂模型车间。
    党的总支委员会和工会为了帮助装配车间催零件，主办了一个“追根报”。“追根报”的大黑板就站在工厂的大门口，职工们早上一上班第一眼就看见它。“追根报”上画着一个装配车间的工人，伸开两手叫着：“咱们停工待料了，你们赶快把下面这些部件送来吧！”下面，装配车间每天填上他们急需的零件名称。追根报上写了那些零件，那些零件就成了有关车间或科股当天的头等重要的任务。
    那时候，各车间归生产科领导。生产科实际上是“集市”，而不是指挥生产的机构。你要零件，他要材料，我要工具，大家都来争吵催逼。生产科既不了解车间情况，也无权指挥其他科股，自然很难知道究竟那一天才能满足这些要求。只好随口支唔
    “明天给你”，“后天给你”。这个“集市”不能解决问题，大问题就一直吵到厂长那里，厂长每天也得跟着大家催部件找工具。那时候厂部每天召开生产会议，在这个会议上大家照例为零件、为原材料等争吵得面红耳赤。原加工车间的工段长辛景泉说得好：“那时候干工作靠的就是两条腿和一张嘴，脑子没法动。有时也想到一些问题，可是，一下子就给这些打补绽的事情给挤忘了。”那时候干部们脑子里塞满了号码（零件的代号），可是，你要问起每个人职责范围以内的任务完成得怎么样，生产中有什么问题，谁也答复不出来。
    混乱不堪的加工车间
    加工车间并不是不愿意满足装配车间的需要，而是没有人告诉他们应该怎样根据装配车间的需要来安排零件的生产。每月的生产指标下来以后，他们有什么原材料就干什么，或者那些活好干容易得超额工资（该厂实行计件工资）就多干。结果，有的零件加工出来了一大堆，堆在零件库里，有的没有或者不够用。等到“追根报”提出要求后，加工车间主任、调度员、工段长就只好临时给工人们派活。于是，工人手里的活没干完，就得搁下，重找工具、重领材料来做新的，这个新的还没做完，常常就又派上另外的催得更紧的新零件了，车床上经常堆满了干了半截的活；难做的活分给小工匠，简单的活分给大工匠也就成了常事。结果，浪费了工时，废品也越来越多。工人出了废品（影响工资收入）就埋怨，有些人干脆把料一扔，工票一撕，谁也不告诉。有的活刚出来，顾不上登记送检，就给拿走了。车间里究竟投下了多少原材料、出了多少零件、多少废品、在制的零件流转的情况怎样，车间干部根本没办法知道。记录数字车间一个样，零件库一个样，生产科一个样，谁也不知道究竟那个对。工人们今天不知明天干什么，干这个活时不知下一个干什么，想找窍门也无从找起。就是找了窍门学习了先进经验，也很难发挥作用。
    经常完不成任务
    突击生产的结果是经常完不成任务。一九五一年一至八月份，三厂生产车床的任务只完成计划的百分之五十三。突击生产的结果，设备经常停歇，工时浪费严重，加班加点引起工资超支，生产中废品率很高，月月赔钱。每月发工资，常靠银行贷款。突击生产根本顾不上产品质量。一九五一年一至八月份根本没有生产过一、二级品，全部产品中三级品占百分之五十六，其余都是丝杠串动、齿轮噪音或是硬度不合格的等外品。
    混乱的根源
    为什么会产生这种混乱的情况呢？关键在于：在机械三厂这样一个十分复杂的现代化的企业里，没有一个可以反映生产规律的计划来指导和组织整个企业的生产活动，在盲目活动中，人们就不可能预见事物发展中的问题，就不能不被许多意料不到的问题支配得忙乱被动以致完全陷于混乱。
    机械三厂是一个生产过程十分复杂的工厂。每台车床所需要的九百多种零件有大有小有简单有复杂，合起来需要七千多道工序，三千多种主要的和辅助的原材料。这些零件除了极少数由兄弟厂供给外，都需要经过翻砂锻造、加工而后装配。对于这样复杂的企业，三厂的管理干部过去不是运用科学的组织工作和计划工作而是依靠“大概”、“差不多”的“估计”来进行管理。每到月底，主管计划的科股大概算一算车间工人的劳动生产率和机械设备的能力，估计差不多，就确定了下月的计划。生产一批车床，应该什么时候投进原材料、什么时候翻砂锻造，什么时候加工，什么时候装配，工序间需要占用多少零件，零件库需要储备多少零件等，管理干部们既不知道也不去计算。本来一台机床的生产过程需要两个多月，三厂却总是盲目的当月做计划当月就想要产品。那时，三厂只有一个月生产多少台机床的计划，各个车间以至各工段、小组的每天的进度和相互配合联系的问题都没有人去管。所以，每月虽有个计划，但具体的生产活动还是盲目的、无组织的。
    作业计划组织了整个企业的活动
    今年五月初，我来到机械三厂，这是月初，但是，装配车间已经不再是过去那种冷清清的样子了。从头一道工序到最后一道工序，工人们都在紧张地操作。这里，正在装配床头、床腿……那里，车床已经站了起来，到了车间的最后，工人们把这些质量合乎标准的车床喷上蓝灰色的油漆，油漆已干的，工人们正在把它们包装入库。生产像流水一样，后浪推着前浪，这边零件不断进入车间，那边车床不断按计划入库，装配车间的冷热病已经不再发作了。
    这是一个巨大的变化，这变化是从一九五一年八月开始的。
    一九五一年八月，三厂管理干部认真地学习了苏联先进经验“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”，每个月的计划，连车间、工段、小组、工人和有关的科股都规定的很具体，按日排好进度，作出作业计划，建立了各种指示图表，随着作业计划和各种图表由简到繁、由粗到精，生产中的盲目性也随之日渐减少。
    作业计划有秩序地把复杂的生产过程规划出来。它根据装配一台车床的需要，规定什么时候准备好原材料、什么时候做好生产前的准备工作、什么时候加工车间开始加工、以及那些零件由那些人在那些机床上加工，什么时候零件到达零件库等等。把计划进度制成图表，每一个生产单位就可以按照这个图表指示的日程办事。图表上红蓝线指示出计划和实际完成的情况。红蓝线有距离了，人们就会立即采取措施去解决，以免下一个工序停工待料。每周、每月各车间还要检查作业计划的执行情况，从而改进作业计划，同时发现生产中的薄弱环节，作为下个月应该解决的关键问题。有了计划，掌握了执行计划的情况，人们已不再被各种突如其来的问题追得忙乱不堪，而是有计划有步骤地去发现并解决各种问题。
    一位新从另外一个机器厂调到三厂来的同志说，到三厂后和原来那个厂子比较，立刻感到三厂的厂部轻闲，车间虽忙而不乱。他说，那个厂的厂长，每天自己计划要做的事情，最多只能做十分之二三。这里的厂长，每天却可以有十分之七八按自己计划办事，没有那么多的停工待料，没有那么许多
    “三不管”的问题来纠缠他。看看这个厂里一天的活动，就可以知道这话是不错的了。每天早上，所有的干部都有两小时的文化、理论或政治、技术学习。科长和车间主任以上的干部还要再学一小时的业务。而后，车间，各科股都分别检查前一日的进度。根据图表所显示的问题，车间主任，车间调度员等分别有重点地到车间了解情况检查完不成进度的原因。上午十时半至十一时半，车间开一个调度会议，解决前一日发生的问题，准备参加厂的调度会议。午后，生产科开全厂的调度会议，解决全厂进度及有关问题。现在这个会议不但开得很快（一小时）而且也不再争吵了。这个会议后，除了一些日常行政事务外，下午的时间大家都可以用来研究问题解决问题。我到了二加工车间，车间主任讲，他们正在想法突破天车不够用因而影响生产的薄弱环节。到了装配车间，他们正在考虑缩短生产循环期等问题。各个环节上发生的问题都分别有人及时考虑解决，厂长等领导干部大大摆脱了日常事务的缠绕，虽然，会议过多还是一个很大的负担，但是已经有相当的时间来考虑每个时期有关整个企业前进一步的关键问题了。
    每月讨论计划时，每个工人都合理地按排了自己一个月中每天的生产活动，今天不知明天干什么的情况已经再也不存在了。现在，如果有一个月的指标下得晚了一点，工人们就会主动地催促干部，他们再也不肯盲目地生产了。加上改变了劳动组织，实行了劳动分工专业化，大家学习技术找窍门的热情大大提高了。过去要二、三级技工干的活，现在才学四五个月的徒工就能干了。一九五二年的劳动生产率比一九五一年提高了百分之八十九。
    发挥了巨大的潜在力量
    计划管理发挥了三厂的巨大的潜在力量。一九五二年三厂的产量比一九五一年提高了二点三九倍（人力设备基本上没有增加）；生产总值比一九五一年增加百分之九十。产品质量也显著提高，一九五二年一月消灭了三级品，十一月份消灭了二级品，产品的成本也降低了百分之五点五七。机械三厂已经从突击生产和经常完不成任务，变成了一个均衡地超额完成任务的工厂了。
