Everyone Can Create Honor
——The People Building Anshan
By our reporter Lu Hao

No matter what work you do, as long as you love your work, as long as you put your heart into your work, you can create honor.

You may be a clerk or an accountant, doing copying or calculating numbers all day long. Don't think that the work you do is insignificant, because if you make a slight mistake, it may cause huge losses to our country. You may be a car driver or a train attendant, passing through here today and there tomorrow. Perhaps some people will say that your work is monotonous and trivial, but it is precisely your labor that saves the time of millions of people and makes their travel to and from various places convenient and comfortable.

Countless people silently bury themselves in their work, forming every victorious front of our motherland. Here, let me tell you the story of an ordinary person doing ordinary work, and how he relied on his own efforts to create honor.

A year ago, Zhao Shouzhi, a material clerk, had a muddled view of his work. He divided work into two types: one was so-called "promising" work. In his opinion, being a technician, being able to write and calculate, could slowly lead to becoming an expert; even being an apprentice, as long as you learn a set of skills, you can become a skilled worker in the future, with high wages and good benefits. The other was so-called "unpromising" work. Like himself, managing materials meant sitting in the office deducting numbers, busy and fragmented; it meant going out in wind and rain, running around to serve others. After working hard for a long time, the superiors said you haven’t mastered the system, and the subordinates said you only know how to deduct things, pleasing neither side. At that time, he really felt that any job was better than being a material clerk, and he only hated that he hadn't studied science and mathematics and taken the wrong path. At that time, he only said verbally that revolutionary work was not divided into high or low status, and that any job was equally glorious, etc., but when he encountered practical problems, he couldn't stand it.

Today's Zhao Shouzhi is different. He no longer makes a fuss about wages or benefits. He is now in charge of timber supply. This year, the timber used for construction in Anshan, if stacked four meters high, would occupy a circle of fifty li, what a huge number that is! In this work, he is no longer just issuing materials when you come to collect them, or issuing what the superiors approve, as if he has no responsibility of his own. Now, when someone comes to collect timber, he must find out what kind of project it is for, why it is necessary to use such materials, and if the material collector cannot answer, he will immediately follow them to the site to see what is going on, until he understands it, and then he will issue the timber.

When Zhao Shouzhi began to change his view of his work, it seemed as if a layer of haze had been removed from his eyes, and everything seemed clearer than before. For example, some people don’t treat state property the same as they treat their own property. Someone came to collect railway sleepers, and when asked if they were for light rail or heavy rail, they couldn’t answer. Some temporary work sheds and small houses for watching switches were obviously minor projects, but they insisted on collecting grade two materials, and were unhappy when given grade three materials. He thought, why are people so careless with public property? If you lose a match, you know to pick it up immediately, and if you break a mirror, you feel sorry for it, don't you? Why do some people burn a one or two meter long piece of wood without feeling any pity? Why aren't some people sad when they break a box of glass? This made him feel that the people who do materials work are always holding hundreds of millions of the state's money in their hands. The people trust themselves, and that is why they entrusted such a large amount of state property to them. If they are slightly negligent, they don’t know how much money they will waste for the state. Can such a job be said to be unpromising? Can such a job be said to be unimportant?

Zhao Shouzhi thought about these questions, and slowly understood what his director, Ruan Huanzhong, had once said to him: "You are in charge of wood, so you should find a way to drill into the wood. That is to say, you have to understand the use of wood, just like when you wove mats when you were a child, you knew how many mats this bundle of reeds could weave, and what kind of mats it could weave." Only when a person loves his work can he feel the need to learn most urgently. Now Zhao Shouzhi often goes to the site to ask others what templates and supports are used for? How thick should the stair treads be? How long should the wood be for windows and diagonal braces? This bitter child, who had escaped famine in the past and relied on weaving mats for a living since he was a child, slowly became an expert who understood wood. For example, how many years has this batch of wood been, what is it most suitable for? What kind of project must use this kind of material, and not that kind of material, ensuring quality and saving money; as long as he looks at it roughly, nothing can be hidden from him.

Once, the Housing Construction Office needed 968 cubic meters of first-class red and white pine to make house frames and doors and windows, and required that this batch of materials be prepared in a very short time. The specifications for first-class timber are very strict, with no knots and no insect bites. Normally, one hundred cubic meters of red and white pine raw materials can only produce twenty cubic meters of first-class timber; now nearly one thousand cubic meters of first-class timber are needed, which requires selecting from five thousand cubic meters of red and white pine. Some material clerks felt that it would be very difficult to prepare such a large amount of first-class timber in a short period of time, but they thought that since people wanted it, they had to find a way to give it to them, otherwise it would affect the project, and they couldn't be responsible for that. When Zhao Shouzhi learned about this, he didn’t think so, because he had some confidence in his heart, and he felt that why should ordinary residential house frames necessarily use first-class timber? In fact, you like to want first-class timber, and he also wants first-class timber, everyone wants the quality of the timber to be better, but the trees that grow in the forest, where can they all grow into first-class timber?

He had not specialized in civil engineering, so he went to the design office to find civil engineers and asked them if the roof trusses had to use first-class timber, and whether using second-class timber would affect the quality? Some engineers said that second-class timber could also be used. That's not all, he also managed to borrow some books on civil engineering such as "Roof Trusses and Wood Panels" published in the Soviet Union. These books also told him that hardwoods can be used for roof trusses. So, he ran to see Zhu, an engineer in the Housing Construction Office. Engineer Zhu listened to his opinion and replied quite straightforwardly: "We handle things according to the design drawings, and can't control other things."

"We should handle things according to the actual situation. If the drawings are wrong, wouldn't you make suggestions?" Zhao Shouzhi asked him.

"Then you ask the design office to revise the drawings. What if there are problems with the quality of the project?"

"I have asked several engineers, and they all said it is possible. What is your opinion?"

"It won't work even if they say so, I am not responsible if the roof truss breaks."

When Zhao Shouzhi heard this, he thought: Is he still an engineer? He is so afraid of taking responsibility. So he asked again: "Can second-class timber be used after all?"

The engineer didn’t say it could be used, nor did he say it couldn’t be used. Because he had not considered what kind of timber can actually guarantee quality and save money.

Zhao Shouzhi reported this situation to the leaders of the Materials Section, and the leaders of the Materials Section studied it and asked the manager for approval to use second-class timber. At that time, the price difference between each cubic meter of first-class red and white pine and second-class timber was 300,000 yuan; based on Zhao Shouzhi’s suggestion, nearly one thousand cubic meters of timber saved 300 million yuan for the state, while ensuring quality.

Some engineering and technical personnel use materials only for their own convenience, and don’t consider saving money at all; some material clerks feel that it is the engineering and technical personnel’s business to decide what materials to use, and the material clerks can neither control it well nor can they control so much. When these two kinds of people meet together, good materials will never be enough, and inferior materials will never be used up in their lives, and savings that can be avoided will be wasted, and savings that can be made cannot be made. But Zhao Shouzhi is not like this. A construction site wanted to use sheathing boards for the housing, and the material requisition form stated that they wanted second-class timber. Zhao Shouzhi knew that the sheathing boards were placed under the tiles, and as long as the strips didn’t break, there would be no problem with the sheathing boards at all, so he suggested that the construction site use third-class timber.

In 1952, the Materials Section of the Capital Construction Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company had more than 11,000 cubic meters of stagnant timber. These timbers had been exposed to the sun and rain, and some had been stockpiled for one or two years. If they were stockpiled further, there would be a risk of total destruction. The material collectors who came to collect the timber shook their heads when they saw these timbers, complaining that the materials were too inferior, and no one wanted them. Of course, the material clerks were not unaware of these timbers, and some of them said: "This is a matter for the superiors, the superiors will consider it, if the superiors can't solve it, how can we solve it?" Some said: "If we try to use the materials, and there is a problem, who will take the responsibility? Isn't that like a dog catching a mouse, meddling in other people's business." When Zhao Shouzhi saw this situation, he felt that he should find a way to use these timbers. He went to construction sites everywhere to ask and look around, paying attention to this matter. Some places wanted to use five-millimeter-thick jump boards, so they used four-millimeter-thick ones instead. In order to ensure that there were no problems with the quality, they helped to add some supports under the jump boards according to the specific needs. As a result, more than 1,000 cubic meters of four-millimeter-thick jump boards were used up. Some places wanted to make temporary bed legs, so he issued a kind of substandard material. Before long, more than 11,000 cubic meters of stagnant timber that had been stagnant for many years found a way out. This batch of timber, according to conservative estimates, was worth 12.5 billion yuan. Thanks to Zhao Shouzhi's efforts, this batch of funds can continue to circulate, and losses have been avoided.

When Zhao Shouzhi saw that the work he used to think was "unpromising" could save such a large amount of wealth for our motherland time and time again, when he saw those brightly painted house frames, floors, and doors and windows shining in the golden sunlight with such beautiful colors, and he knew that these timbers had all passed through his own hands, he was completely attracted by his work. In the past, when others told him not to stand on this mountain looking at that mountain, he would argue: "You would have the same idea if you did it." When everyone in the section said that some work could be completed ahead of schedule, he would say: "I can't do it, I only earn 140 points, what ability do I have." Now, he felt that his previous whimsical views on his work were really ridiculous. Not long ago, his lover Bu Cuilan came from Shenyang. It was a Sunday, and they had originally agreed to go for a physical examination and register for marriage on this day. As soon as the two of them went out, the construction site called, saying that they didn't have the procedures for collecting materials, but the project urgently needed supports and jump boards, so he hurried to help with the procedures. When he arrived at the timber factory, he presided over the issuing of materials. There were not enough loading workers, so he helped with the transportation. After loading seven train cars of timber, it was already late, and he ran to the director's office to report on the work, and didn't return home until after seven o'clock. The people at home were all anxiously waiting, and his mother complained: "People came from so far away, how can you put aside the urgent matters!" Only then did he remember that the whole family was waiting for him today. He looked at Bu Cuilan apologetically, looking a bit shy, but he still said sweetly: "It's not too late to find another Sunday to do our own thing."

Bu Cuilan lowered her head and did not speak. She looked at his enthusiasm for his work and was also very happy. (Attached picture)

    人人都能创造荣誉
    ——建设鞍山的人们
    本报记者  陆灏
    不论你做什么工作，只要你热爱自己的工作，只要你在自己的工作中付过心血，你就能创造荣誉。
    你也许是一个文书或会计，一天到晚做的是抄写或计算数字的工作，不要以为你做的工作很微小，因为你如果偶一疏忽，说不定就会给我们国家造成巨大的损失。你也许是一个汽车司机或火车上的列车员，今天经过这里，明天又经过这里，或许有人会说你们的工作是呆板的琐碎的，但正是你们的劳动，节省了千百万人的时间，使他们便利而舒适地来往各地。
    无数的人默默地埋头在自己的工作中，组成了我们祖国每一条胜利的战线。这里，让我告诉你们一个做着平常的工作的平常的人，他怎样依靠自己的努力创造了荣誉的故事。
    在一年以前，材料员赵守志对自己的工作还有一种糊涂的看法。他把工作分为两种：一种是所谓“有出息”的工作。在他看来，像当技术员，能写会算，慢慢就能熬成个专家；甚至当个学徒，只要学会一套本领，将来练成个技术工人，工资高，待遇也好。一种是所谓“没出息”的工作。像他自己管理材料，就要坐在办公室扣数字，又忙乱又零碎；就要风里来，雨里去，东跑西颠，侍候别人。累了半天，上面说你没有掌握制度，下边说你只会扣门儿，两头不讨好。逢上这时候，真觉得做什么工作也比当材料员强，只恨自己没有学数理化，走错了路。那时他只是口头上说说革命工作是不分地位高低的，做什么工作也是一样光荣的等等，但是一碰上实际问题，就吃不住了。
    今天的赵守志可就不同了。他再也不去为工资或者什么待遇问题闹情绪了。他现在管木材供应工作。今年鞍山建设所用的木材，如果堆成四公尺高，就要占五十里地的方圆，那是一个多么庞大的数字！他在这个工作中，也再不是你来领，我就发，上边批什么，我就发什么，好像自己什么责任也没有似的。现在有人来领木材，他就一定要弄清楚这是什么样的工程用的，为什么一定要用这样的材料，领料员如果回答不出来，他就马上跟到现场去，看看是究竟怎么一回事，直到弄清楚了，然后才发木材。
    当赵守志开始对自己的工作改变看法的时候，他的眼睛上似乎去掉了一层云翳，一切事情仿佛比以往看得清楚了。譬如有人对待国家的财产，和对待自己的财产总是不完全一样。有人来领枕木，问他是轻便铁道上用的，还是大铁道上用的，他就答不上来。有些临时工棚和看道岔的小房子，明明都是些次要工程，但非要领二等材，发给他三等材，还不乐意。他想，对于公家的东西为什么这样马里马虎呢？自己丢了一根火柴还知道马上拾起来，打破一面镜子心里不是还舍不得吗？为什么有人把一二公尺长的木头拿起来就烧火并不心疼呢？为什么有人打烂了一箱玻璃也不难过呢？这使他感觉到在做材料工作的人的手里，什么时候也拿着国家亿万的钱财，人民相信自己，才把国家这样大的财产交给自己管理，自己稍许一疏忽，就不知要瞎掉国家多少钱。这样的工作能够说是没有出息的吗？这样的工作能够说是不重要的吗？
    赵守志想到了这些问题，才慢慢地懂得了他的处长阮焕中有一次对他说过的话：“你是管木头的，你就应该想办法钻到木头里去。就是说，要懂得木头的使用，像你小时候编席子，知道这捆苇子能编多少席子，能编什么样的席子一样。”一个人，只有在热爱自己的工作的时候，才能最迫切地感到需要学习。现在的赵守志，他常常到现场去，向别人请教模板、支柱是做什么用的？楼梯板应该多么厚？窗户和斜撑要多么长的木头。这个过去逃过荒，从小就靠编席过日子的苦孩子，慢慢就成为一个懂得木头的内行人了。譬如这批木头是多少年的，它最适合作什么用；什么样的工程，一定要用这样的材料，而不能用那样的材料，既保证了质量，又能够节约；这些，只要大体经过他一看，就什么也瞒不过他了。
    有一次，住宅工程处要九百六十八立方公尺的红白松一等材做房架和门窗，而且要求在很短的时间内就备齐这批材料。一等材的木头规格很严，要没有节，没有虫咬，平常一百立方公尺红白松的原材料，只能出二十立方公尺一等材；现在需要近千立方公尺的一等材，那就要在五千立方公尺的红白松中挑选。有的材料员觉得要在短时间内备齐这样大数目的一等材，困难很多，但认为人家既然要，咱们就得想办法给，否则影响了工程，自己可负不了这个责任。赵守志知道了这件事，他就不这样想，因为他心里有点底，他觉得一般普通住宅的房架，为什么非要一等材不可呢？事实上，你喜欢要一等材，他也想要一等材，谁也要求木材的质量好一些，可是树林里长的木头，那里全能长成一等材呢。
    他没有专门学过土木建筑，他于是跑到设计处去找土木工程师，问他们屋架是不是都要用一等材，用二等材是不是就要影响质量？有的工程师就表示，用二等材也可以。这还不算，他还想办法借到了一些苏联出版的“屋架和木板”等有关土木建筑的书籍。这些书上也告诉他，硬木都是可以做屋架的。于是，他就跑去见住宅工程处的朱工程师。朱工程师听了他的意见，回答得挺干脆：“我们根据设计图纸办事，别的事管不了。”
    “应该根据实际情况办事。如果图纸错了，你就不提意见了吗？”赵守志问他。
     “那么你们叫设计处改图纸好了。工程质量上发生了问题怎么办？”
        “我问过好几个工程师了，他们都说可以。你的意见怎样？”
    “他们说也不行，屋架断了，我不负责。”
    赵守志一听，心想：还是工程师呢？就那么不敢负责任。他就追问了一下：“二等材到底能不能用？”
    这位工程师不说能用，也不说不能用。因为他没有考虑到实际上究竟什么木材，既能保证质量，又能节约。
    赵守志把这情况反映给材料处的领导同志，材料处的领导同志研究后请示经理批准了用二等材。当时，每一立方公尺一等材的红白松和二等材相比，差价是三十万元；近一千立方公尺的木材，根据赵守志的建议，在保证质量的前提下，为国家节约了三亿元。
    有些工程技术人员用材料，只图自己的方便，根本不考虑节约不节约；有些材料员，觉得决定用什么材料，是工程技术人员的事，当材料员的既不好管，也管不了那么多。这样两种人碰在一起，好材料永远也不会够用，次材料一辈子也用不出去，能够避免浪费的浪费了，能够节约的无法节约。可是赵守志就不是这样。有一个工地的住房上要用扒板，领料单上开的是要二等材，赵守志知道扒板是放在瓦底下的，只要条子不断，扒板就根本不可能出问题，他便建议工地上用了三等材。
        一九五二年，鞍山钢铁公司基本建设部门的材料处有一万一千多立方公尺的呆滞木材。这些木材，日晒雨淋，有的已经积压一二年了，再积压下去，就有全部毁掉的危险。来领木材的领料员见了这些木材，都摇摇头，嫌材料太次，谁也不愿意要。材料员们当然并不是看不见这些木材，他们有的说：“这是上级的事，上级会考虑的，上级要是解决不了，咱们怎么能解决呢？”有的说：“要是想办法把材料用出去了，出了毛病，谁负这个责任？岂不是狗捉耗子，多管闲事。”赵守志见了这情形，觉得应该想办法把这些木材用出去。他去工地上到处问，到处看，留意这件事情。有的地方要用五公厘厚的跳板，他们就拿四公厘厚的去代用，为了保证质量不出毛病，他们根据具体的需要，在跳板下面帮助加些支柱，结果一千多立方公尺四公厘厚的跳板就用出去了。有的地方要做临时床铺的床腿，他就把一种等外材料发了出去。不长的时间，长年呆滞的一万一千多立方公尺的木材都找到了出路。这批木材，按照保守的估计，也要值一百二十五亿元。由于赵守志的努力，这批资金能继续流转了，并且避免了损失。
    当赵守志看到自己过去认为“没有什么出息”的
    工作，竟能一次又一次地为我们的祖国节约这样大量的财富，当他看到那些工程上漆得光采夺目的房架、楼板和门窗，在金色的阳光里闪耀着这样好看的颜色，而他知道这些木材，都曾经过他自己的手的时候，他完全被自己的工作吸引住了。过去，别人说他做工作不要站在这山看着那山高，他会分辩地说：“你来做，你也会有这样的想法的。”有的工作，科里大家都说能提前完成任务，但他却说：“我不行，我只挣一百四十分，我还有什么能力。”现在，他觉得以往对于自己工作那些想入非非的看法实在是太可笑了。不久以前，他的爱人卜翠兰从沈阳来了。这是一个星期天，他们本来约好就在这个日子去检查体格、登记结婚的。两个人刚出门，工地上打来了电话，说没有领料的手续，但工程上迫切需要支柱和跳板，他就赶紧去帮着办手续。到了木材厂，他主持发料，装车工人不够，又帮忙搬运，装完了七火车皮的木材，天色已经不早了，他又跑到处长那里去汇报这个工作，直到七点多钟，才回到了家里。家里的人都等得着急了，他的妈妈埋怨地说：“人家老远来了，你怎么放着紧事儿不办呀！”这时他才记起全家的人今天都在等着他，他抱歉地看了一看卜翠兰，有点害臊的样子，但他还是甜甜地说：“自己的事儿，另外找个星期天办也不迟呀。”
    卜翠兰低着头，没有说话。她看着他为了工作那种喜欢的劲儿，心里也很高兴。（附图片）
