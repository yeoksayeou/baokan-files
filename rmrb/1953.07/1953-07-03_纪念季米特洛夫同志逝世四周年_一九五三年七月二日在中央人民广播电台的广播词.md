    Comrades, fellow compatriots:
    Today is the fourth anniversary of Comrade Dimitrov's death. Comrade Dimitrov was a great communist of the world's working class, an outstanding fighter for peace, and the leader of the Bulgarian people. We commemorate this outstanding leader of the international workers' movement with the highest respect.
    Comrade Dimitrov's life was a life of struggle. Because he demonstrated an unwavering spirit of self-sacrifice in the workers' movement and his boundless loyalty to the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, he won the love of the working people all over the world.
    I still clearly remember when we welcomed him in Moscow in 1934 after he escaped from the clutches of Hitler. The whole world expressed infinite admiration for his heroic struggle in the Leipzig court, where he denounced the fascist bandits on the spot. Then, in August 1935, we heard his famous report at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International on establishing and consolidating the united front of the working class and the people's front to resist and eliminate fascism. He said: "Fascism is the most brutal attack by the bourgeoisie on the working masses; Fascism is rampant national aggression and banditry warfare; Fascism is frenzied reaction and counter-revolution; Fascism is the mortal enemy of the working class and all working people!" This pointed out the reactionary essence of the fascist regime.
    At that time, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, he answered the question of how to stop fascist dictatorship and how to prevent fascist war for millions of workers in various countries, based on the tactical principles of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Dimitrov called for the organization of an anti-fascist united front, "not only to include the working class, peasant masses, working intellectuals, and other laborers, but also to include oppressed nations and people whose national independence is threatened by warmongers," and called for the expansion of this anti-fascist front to the whole world to form a worldwide anti-fascist camp. In order to oppose fascism and defend world peace, Comrade Dimitrov said: "It is not enough to merely hope for peace, but also to fight for peace." To fight for peace, organizers and leaders are needed. Therefore, he particularly emphasized that only a united proletariat can become the organizer of this peace front and the leader and backbone of this front.
    Comrade Dimitrov was a friend of the Chinese people, and he gave great sympathy and encouragement to the Chinese revolution. At the Seventh Congress of the Communist International in August 1935, Comrade Dimitrov made important principled instructions on the issue of forming a national united front against Japan in China. He also said on behalf of all the delegates at the congress: "We sincerely say to the Chinese people: We firmly support your heroic national liberation struggle, and are determined to help you overthrow the oppression of all imperialist robbers and their Chinese lackeys, and help you achieve complete liberation." This won warm applause from all the delegates.
    In 1936, in an article commemorating the "Fifteenth Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party," Comrade Dimitrov gave enthusiastic praise to the liberation struggle being carried out by the Chinese people. He said, "The Chinese Communist Party has proved in the past fifteen years that it is loyal to the interests of the Chinese people and that it is good at fighting for the interests and liberation of the Chinese people... We must give affectionate care and genuine spiritual and political support to the Chinese people who are engaged in the liberation struggle... This great Chinese people is fighting for their national independence and survival on one of the most critical fronts of the world's anti-fascist and anti-war front." In his report to the Fifth National Congress of the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist Party) in 1948, he again emphasized the glorious historical significance of the liberation war won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party.
    Comrade Dimitrov was a great internationalist and patriot. He said: "In every country, the internationalism of the proletariat should 'adapt to the local climate' in order to plant its roots locally. The national forms of the proletariat's struggle and the workers' movement in individual countries do not violate the internationalism of the proletariat; on the contrary, it is in this form that the interests of the internationalism of the proletariat can also be victoriously upheld." During the anti-fascist war, Comrade Dimitrov led the Bulgarian people in their struggle against the German invaders. After the liberation of Bulgaria, he devoted his tireless energy to Bulgaria's socialist construction and Bulgarian-Soviet friendship. Under his leadership, the Bulgarian people completed the two-year economic plan in 1948, and then engaged in the five-year economic plan. After Comrade Dimitrov's death, under the leadership of Comrade Chervenkov, the Bulgarian people followed the path prescribed by Comrade Dimitrov, learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and completed the five-year plan ahead of schedule in four years, thus changing the face of Bulgaria.
    In order to commemorate this great communist and outstanding fighter for the defense of world peace, we should more bravely shoulder the cause of defending world peace. As everyone knows, in the Korean armistice negotiations, thanks to the efforts of China and North Korea, an agreement was reached on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, which prepared the conditions for the Korean armistice. At this time, the Syngman Rhee gang in South Korea, with the connivance of the United States, created a serious incident of "releasing" prisoners of war, which was actually forcibly detaining prisoners of war. At the same time, the United States government also attempted to conclude a so-called "common defense treaty" with Syngman Rhee to encourage the Syngman Rhee gang to continue to undermine the Korean armistice. At the same time, fascist bandits in West Germany, under the direction of American intelligence agencies, created shameful riots in the democratic districts of Berlin. Although the West German conspirators failed and Syngman Rhee's act of sabotaging the armistice was condemned by broad world opinion, these facts show that the enemies of peace are still attacking, and we must resolutely defeat their conspiracies that threaten all mankind!
    Comrade Dimitrov's calls for opposing fascism, opposing war, defending international peace, and for the international peace and unity front still have great guiding significance in today's struggle to defend world peace. We should learn from Comrade Dimitrov's great efforts for the international peace and unity front, more strongly unite within the peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union, maintain a high degree of vigilance against the enemies of peace, and strive for lasting world peace. All the conspiracies and attempts of warmongers and fascist bandits will surely fail; peace and democracy will surely triumph!
    Comrade Dimitrov's spirit is immortal!

    纪念季米特洛夫同志逝世四周年
    ——一九五三年七月二日在中央人民广播电台的广播词
    中国人民大学校长　吴玉章同志们、同胞们：
    今天是季米特洛夫同志逝世的四周年纪念日。季米特洛夫同志是世界工人阶级伟大的共产主义者、杰出的和平战士、保加利亚人民的领袖。我们怀着崇高的敬意，来纪念这位国际工人运动杰出的领袖。
    季米特洛夫同志的一生是战斗的一生。因为他在工人运动中表现了坚贞不屈的自我牺牲精神，和他对马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说的无限忠诚，博得了全世界劳动人民的热爱。
    我还清楚地记得：一九三四年我们在莫斯科欢迎他从希特勒魔掌中脱险出来的时候，全世界对于他在莱比锡法庭上当场斥责法西斯匪徒的英勇斗争，表现了无限的崇敬。接着在一九三五年八月，又听到他在共产国际第七次大会上为建立和巩固工人阶级的统一战线和人民阵线，以抵抗和消灭法西斯主义的著名报告。他说：“法西斯主义——就是资产阶级向劳动群众施行的最残酷的进攻；法西斯主义——就是横行无忌的民族侵略主义和强盗战争；法西斯主义——就是疯狂猖獗的反动和反革命；法西斯主义——就是工人阶级和全体劳动群众的死敌！”这样就指出了法西斯政权的反动实质。
    就在那时候，他根据马克思列宁主义的策略原理，在斯大林同志的领导之下，对各种不同国度的千百万劳动者回答了如何阻止法西斯专政，和如何防止法西斯战争的问题。季米特洛夫同志号召组织反法西斯统一战线，“不仅要包括工人阶级、农民群众、劳动知识分子和其他劳动者，而且还要包括被压迫民族以及受战争挑拨者威胁其国家独立的人民”，并且号召把这种反法西斯战线扩大到全世界去，以形成全世界反法西斯的营垒。为了反对法西斯和保卫世界和平，季米特洛夫同志说：“仅仅希望和平，是不够的，还应当为和平而斗争。”要为争取和平而斗争，就需要组织者和领袖。因此，他特别着重指出：只有团结一致的无产阶级，才能成为这一和平战线的组织者，成为这一战线的领导和骨干。
    季米特洛夫同志是中国人民的朋友，他对中国革命曾经给予很大的同情和鼓舞。在一九三五年八月共产国际第七次大会上，季米特洛夫同志对于在中国组成抗日民族统一战线问题，曾作了重要的原则指示。他并且在大会上代表全体代表说：“我们很诚恳地向中国人民说：我们坚决拥护你们的英勇的民族解放的斗争。决意帮助你们打倒一切帝国主义强盗及其中国走狗的压迫。帮助你们谋得完全的解放。”曾经博得了全体代表的热烈欢呼。
    一九三六年季米特洛夫同志在“中国共产党十五周年纪念”一文中，对中国人民正在进行的解放斗争予以热情的赞扬，他说：“中国共产党在十五年来已经证明自己忠实于中国人民的利益，并证明自己善于为中国人民的利益和解放而斗争……必须对正在进行解放斗争的中国人民予以亲热的爱护和真正精神上、政治上的拥护。……这个伟大的中国人民正在全世界反法西斯主义与反战争战线的一个最严重的阵地上进行为自己民族独立生存的斗争”。一九四八年在保加利亚工人党（共产党）第五次全国代表大会的报告中，他又强调指出中国人民在伟大的中国共产党领导之下所赢得的解放战争的光辉的历史意义。
    季米特洛夫同志是一个伟大的国际主义者和爱国主义者。他说过：“在每一个国家里，无产阶级的国际主义都应当‘适应本地的气候’，以便在本地种下自己的根基。个别国家里无产阶级斗争和工人运动的民族形式是不违反无产阶级的国际主义的，恰恰相反，正是在这种形式里，同时还可以胜利地拥护无产阶级的国际主义的利益。”季米特洛夫同志在反法西斯战争中领导了保加利亚人民反抗德国侵略者的斗争。在保加利亚解放以后，他又以不倦的精力，贡献于保加利亚的社会主义建设事业和保苏的友好。在他的领导下，保加利亚人民于一九四八年完成了两年经济计划，接着又从事于五年经济计划。季米特洛夫同志逝世后，保加利亚人民在契尔文科夫同志的领导下，遵循着季米特洛夫同志所规定的道路，学习苏联的先进经验，使五年计划在四年内提前完成了，因而改变了保加利亚国家的面貌。
    为着纪念这位伟大的共产主义者、杰出的保卫世界和平的战士，我们应该把保卫世界和平的事业更勇敢地担负起来。大家知道，在朝鲜停战谈判中，由于中朝两国所作的努力，使战俘遣返问题达成了协议，并为朝鲜停战准备了条件。正在这个时候，南朝鲜李承晚匪帮在美国纵容下，制造了“释放”战俘实即强迫扣留战俘的严重事件，同时，美国政府还企图与李承晚缔结所谓“共同防御条约”，来鼓励李承晚匪帮继续破坏朝鲜停战。与此同时，西德的法西斯匪徒也在美国特务机关的指使之下，在柏林的民主区制造了可耻的暴乱。虽然西德的阴谋分子是失败了，李承晚破坏停战的行为也受到了世界广大舆论的斥责，但是这些事实表明，和平的敌人还在进攻，我们必须坚决地打垮他们威胁全人类的阴谋！
    季米特洛夫同志关于反对法西斯、反对战争、保卫国际和平以及关于国际和平统一阵线所作的号召，在今天保卫世界和平的斗争中，依然有很大的指导意义。我们应该学习季米特洛夫同志为国际和平统一阵线所做的巨大努力，更坚强地团结在以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营内，对和平的敌人保持高度的警惕，争取世界的持久的和平。战争挑拨者、法西斯匪帮的一切阴谋企图，必将归于失败；和平民主一定得到胜利！
    季米特洛夫同志的精神永垂不朽！
