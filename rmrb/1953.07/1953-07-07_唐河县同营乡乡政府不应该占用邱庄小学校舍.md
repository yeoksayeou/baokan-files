    Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Tongying Township Government in Tanghe County Should Not Occupy Qiuzhuang Primary School Premises
    Zhao Peiran and others from Qiuzhuang Central School in Tanghe County, Henan Province, write: Our school has more than 300 students, but only four classrooms. The first-grade children have to sit in the courtyard to attend classes. The Tongying Township People's Government not only does not help us solve the housing problem, but also occupied our school classrooms during last year's winter vacation. When school started, we asked them to return the rooms, but they refused to move out. After several consultations, they finally moved to a smaller classroom in the east. As a result, we were left with only three classrooms, and four classes of students were squeezed into three classrooms. There was not even an aisle, and students had to climb over desks to move around. At the same time, the township government often holds meetings and handles mass disputes while classes are in session, disrupting the students' ability to concentrate on their studies. In the evening, the township government occupies the classrooms for meetings, often messing up and damaging the desks and chairs. We have repeatedly raised these issues with them, but to no avail.
    In March of this year, the district government approved the construction of six thatched houses, which barely met our school's needs. Unexpectedly, during the wheat harvest holiday, township government cadres such as Duan Changhai took advantage of our absence from school and occupied two of our classrooms, which they have not yet vacated. This unreasonable occupation of school premises by the Tongying Township Government has seriously affected our teaching work, and the Tanghe County People's Government should promptly investigate and handle this matter.

    唐河县同营乡乡政府不应该占用邱庄小学校舍
    河南省唐河县邱庄中心学校赵沛然等来信：我校有三百多个学生，但只有四个教室；一年级的儿童只得坐在院子里上课。同营乡人民政府不但不帮助我们解决房屋问题，反而在去年寒假期间占用我校教室。开学时，我们向他们要房子，他们不肯搬走。经几度磋商后，他们总算搬到东边一个较小的教室里。这样，我们只剩了三个教室，四个班的学生挤在三个教室里上课，连走道都没有，学生出入来往，都要从桌子上翻来翻去。同时，在我校上课时乡政府时常召开会议，处理群众纠纷，扰乱得学生们不能安心上课。晚上乡政府又占用教室开会，经常弄乱和损坏桌凳。我们屡次向他们提出意见，也无效果。
    今年三月间，区政府批准我们盖了六间草房，这样我们校舍才算勉强够用。不料，麦假期间，乡政府干部段长海等趁我们不在学校，又占住我们二间教室，直到现在还不肯让出。同营乡政府这种无理占用校舍的行为，已经严重地影响了我们的教学工作，唐河县人民政府应该迅速调查处理。
