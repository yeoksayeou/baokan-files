When Tian Zhengui Came to Beijing
        Lian Yunshan

    This event took place on April 13th.

    On the morning of that day, in a bunker on a Volunteer Army position somewhere on the Korean front, sniper Tian Zhengui was holding his rifle, intently observing the enemy's hilltop position. He knew every blade of grass, every piece of earth, and every stone there very well.

    He tried his best to find any changes in those places so that he could study them further and wait for an opportunity to hunt. But, today half the day was almost over. The enemy, frightened by the cold shots, hid in their fortifications, not daring to show their heads at all. But this cold shot sniping, unlike other operations, required greater perseverance and patience. So Tian Zhengui continued to observe repeatedly without arrogance or impatience.

    Suddenly, he heard a burst of hurried footsteps behind him. He turned his head and saw that it was none other than the little messenger from the company headquarters, the innocent and lovely Jia Qingpu, running up breathlessly with a rifle in his arms. He dived into the bunker without saying a word, then pounced forward, grasping Tian Zhengui's hands with both of his, looking up at Tian Zhengui with his small face, his eyes darting about, his mouth wide open, eager to speak, but unable to. This stunned Tian Zhengui: "Little messenger has never been so nervous when delivering orders! Could it be that some particularly urgent situation has occurred?" Tian Zhengui quickly leaned forward and asked, "What's the matter, kid? Tell me quickly!" But the little messenger still just opened his mouth and couldn't speak. Tian Zhengui became even more anxious and squeezed the little messenger's hand forcefully, asking: "Quick, quick, quick, what's the emergency? Tell me quickly!"

    "You, you, you, Old Tian! You, you are too glorious, you are going to Beijing, to see Chairman Mao." Tian Zhengui breathed a slight sigh of relief and said somewhat reproachfully, "Don't joke around. Is there really an emergency?"

    "Really, no joke, I won't lie to you, this is the emergency! The superiors just called, telling you to go to Beijing, leave immediately, arrive at the regiment at seven o'clock tonight, go to the division early tomorrow morning, and return to the country to participate in the 'May Day' observation ceremony!"

    "Really? Why didn't you say anything for so long? You scared me." Tian Zhengui finally completely relaxed, and a face full of smiles replaced his nervous expression. He believed what the little messenger said because he knew that the little messenger never told a lie. "You, Old Tian, you are too glorious, you are going to see Chairman Mao, I have so much to say, how, how should I say it?" Jia Qingpu was simply beside himself with excitement.

    Suddenly, he grabbed Tian Zhengui as if afraid he would run away, saying, "Old Tian, wait for me, I'll write a letter to our great leader Chairman Mao."

    The news that Tian Zhengui was returning to the motherland, to Beijing, to see Chairman Mao spread like a gust of wind on the position. All that could be seen were the soldiers running around telling each other, everywhere was a scene of cheering. All that could be heard here and there was shouting: "A person returning to the motherland, going to Beijing, to see Chairman Mao has emerged from our position!" "It's him, Tian Zhengui, the sniper who has made the enemy unable to lift their heads." Following the cheering, a silence began in the various tunnels. Some soldiers lay on the rocks, some lay on the shooting platforms, and some simply raised their knees. They were all writing letters to Chairman Mao.

    Now, Tian Zhengui appeared in the company headquarters tunnel, and the tunnel was filled with jubilation. The telephone rang constantly, the battalion urged Tian Zhengui to set off quickly; the people who came to see him off were waiting there, and the battalion commander and political instructor also had words of encouragement. But how could he leave? It was so busy here! The clerk hastily looked at the observation post's records, closed the notebook, and said in one breath: "Tian Zhengui has been on the position for less than three months. Except for 'giving the enemy a holiday' on Christmas and stopping fighting for two days, and stopping fighting for one day to participate in the celebration meeting, he has killed a total of one hundred and sixty-four enemies in eighty days, including nine officers. He has been awarded the Second Class Merit." Amidst the applause of the representatives of each squad, Company Commander Zheng Hui tightly grasped Tian Zhengui's hand and said:

    "Comrade Tian Zhengui, that a person from our company's position can return to the motherland, enter Beijing, and see our great leader Chairman Mao, is not only the supreme glory of you, Tian Zhengui, alone, but also the glory of our Fourth Company Party Branch, and the glory of every comrade in our entire company! Please tell the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao that the position of the Fourth Company will create even greater glory for the motherland and Chairman Mao." As soon as the company commander's words were finished, a group of people immediately surrounded him. They were the representatives selected by the soldiers scattered in every corner of the position. They were holding letters written by the soldiers themselves to Chairman Mao, braving the artillery fire, to come to the company headquarters tunnel. They rushed to stuff the letters into Tian Zhengui's pockets and satchel, and kept saying the words that the soldiers wanted Tian Zhengui to bring to Chairman Mao, a noisy scene that left Tian Zhengui covered in sweat and still unable to cope. The little messenger Jia Qingpu, believing that he was the first to spread the good news, had the right to be special. He stuffed the letter into Tian Zhengui's upper pocket and shouted especially loudly: "Old Tian, you must protect this letter, when you see our great leader Chairman Mao, shake hands with him with this hand, and then quickly stuff this letter into his old man's hand, and tell him an additional sentence: 'Jia Qingpu will definitely perform meritorious service.'"

    These few soldier representatives had not finished shaking hands with Tian Zhengui when another group of people crowded up.

    It was almost midnight when Tian Zhengui appeared in the battalion headquarters tunnel. Here again was an excited crowd, frenzied cheers, and letters like snowflakes.

    The telephone rang again and again, the regiment urged Tian Zhengui to get up quickly, people were waiting there to see him off!

    The Fifth Company's soldiers selected the most capable and most experienced representatives, carrying letters written by the soldiers themselves to Chairman Mao, braving the artillery fire, heading from all directions to the battalion main peak tunnel, giving the soldiers' letters one by one to Tian Zhengui, asking him to hand them over to our beloved leader Chairman Mao.

    The Fifth Company's representatives had just retreated when the Sixth Company's representatives surged up again.

    At twelve o'clock at night, Tian Zhengui, carrying a bulging satchel of letters, no, many soldiers' brave hearts fighting for peace, out of the battalion main peak tunnel, from the jubilation of comrades shaking hands and congratulating him and the exhortations of people entrusting him to deliver letters. At this time, there were still people behind him holding up letters high, shouting: "Tian Zhengui, wait for me!" Running down the mountain covered in sweat, and stuffing another stack of letters into Tian Zhengui's hand.

    Tian Zhengui was excitedly heading towards the regimental headquarters when suddenly, several people on horseback came up to him and asked loudly: "Is that Comrade Tian Zhengui coming?" "Yes!" Tian Zhengui really didn't expect anyone to call his name here again. "Great, what a coincidence, we just arrived here." It turned out that the artillery company had learned of the news very late, they were worried that they would be too late to go to the battalion main peak, so they selected representatives to ride horses in batches to several roads that Tian Zhengui might pass, waiting. They dismounted,

    while vying to shake hands with Tian Zhengui, and said: "We don't have time to write letters, Comrade Tian Zhengui, when you see Chairman Mao, please tell his old man a sentence: 'The artillery company will definitely perform meritorious service in battle, and strive for greater glory for the motherland and his old man.'"

    At two o'clock at night, Tian Zhengui appeared in the regimental headquarters tunnel auditorium. The regimental leaders, representatives of the regimental direct units, representatives of each battalion, and the members of the cultural troupe sent by the division, had been waiting since dark. The regimental leaders shook his hand, congratulated him, and gave him cordial instructions. Representatives of each unit solemnly handed him the letters written by the soldiers themselves to Chairman Mao. Songs, gongs and drums, and people's cheers intertwined into one: "Glory! The meritorious comrade Tian Zhengui!" "Send greetings to the motherland!" "Send greetings to our beloved leader Chairman Mao!" Tian Zhengui left the regimental headquarters in the warm send-off of the people.

    Tian Zhengui, a person who had tasted all the bitterness in the old society, never dreamed that he would have today: the leaders' concern for him, the comrades' trust in him, the hundreds of letters filling his satchel and pockets, and, in a few days, he would see Beijing, Tiananmen, Chairman Mao…This new life gave him honor, made him excited, moved…His mood was just as he himself said: "Indescribable".

    When he was about to arrive at the division headquarters, it was about to dawn, and a round of red sun rose in the east, the ten thousand rays of colorful clouds, shining on the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea, also shining on our sniper, an ordinary soldier who was about to return to the motherland - Tian Zhengui.

    田正贵来北京的时候
    连云山
    这事情发生的时间，是四月十三日。
    这天上午，在朝鲜前线某地志愿军阵地上的一个地堡里，狙击手田正贵托着枪，全神贯注地观察着敌人的山头阵地。那里的一草一木，一土一石他都是非常清楚的。
    他竭力想发现那些地方有什么变化，好再深入研究，待机猎获。但是，今天的上半天就要过去了。被冷枪打怕了的敌人，缩在工事里，根本不敢露头。可是这冷枪狙击，就不同于其它作战，是需要更大的坚韧和耐心的。于是田正贵继续不骄不躁地反复观察。
    忽然听到后面一阵急促的脚步声，他回头一看，不是别人，正是连部的小通讯员，那天真可爱的贾庆普，气喘吁吁地抱着枪跑来了。他钻进地堡一言未发，就扑了上来，双手把田正贵的手握住，仰起小脸，两眼滴溜溜地看着田正贵，大张着嘴，急着想说话，但是说不出来。这可把田正贵给楞住了：“小通讯员传命令从来没有这样紧张过呀！莫非是发生了什么特别的紧急情况？”田正贵就赶紧凑前问道“有什么事，小鬼，你快说！”可是小通讯员仍旧只张着嘴说不出话来。田正贵更加着急起来，就用力地捏着小通讯员的手问：“快，快，快，是什么紧急情况，你快说呀！”
    “你，你，你，老田！你，太光荣了，要到北京，见毛主席。”田正贵稍稍松了一口气，有点责备似地说：“你不要开玩笑，到底有没有紧急情况？”
    “真的，不开玩笑，绝不骗你，这就是紧急情况呀！刚才上级来电话，叫你进北京，马上动身，晚上七点到团，明天一早到师，回国参加‘五一’节观礼哪！”
    “真的？为啥你来了半晌不说话？把我吓了一跳。”田正贵这才把心完全放下来，满脸的笑代替了紧张的神色。他相信了小通讯员说的话，因为他知道小通讯员是从来不说一句谎话的。“你，老田，太光荣了，你是要见毛主席的人了，我有许多话要说，这，这该怎说好呢？”贾庆普简直兴奋到极点了。
    突然，他把田正贵一把拉住，好像怕他跑掉似的说：“老田，你等等，我来写个信，给咱伟大领袖毛主席。”
    田正贵要回祖国，到北京，去见毛主席的消息，像一股风一样在阵地上迅速地传开了。只看到战士们到处奔走相告，到处一片欢呼。只听得这里、那里在喊：“回祖国，去北京，见毛主席的人出在咱们阵地上了。”“就是他，田正贵，打得敌人抬不起头来的狙击手。”跟着欢呼，在各个坑道里开始了一片寂静，战士们有的伏在石头上，有的伏在射击台上，有的就竖起膝盖，都在给毛主席写信了。
    现在，田正贵出现在连部的坑道里，坑道里充满着欢腾。电话铃不断哗哗地响，营里催田正贵迅速动身；欢送的人在那里等着，营长和教导员也还有话要嘱咐呢。可是怎么能动身，这里是多么紧张啊！文书匆匆地看了观察哨的记录，把本子一合，一口气往下说道：“田正贵自上阵地不到三个月，除了圣诞节给敌人‘放假’停打两天，参加庆功会停打一天，一共八十天功夫，击毙敌人一百六十四名，其中有九名是军官。立了二等功。”在各班代表的鼓掌声中，连长郑会有紧紧握着田正贵的手说：
    “田正贵同志，我们连的阵地上，能够出现一个人回祖国，进北京，去见我们伟大的领袖毛主席，这不仅是你田正贵一人的无上光荣，而且是我们四连党支部的光荣，是我们全连每个同志的光荣！你转告祖国人民和毛主席，四连的阵地上，将要给祖国和毛主席创造更大的光荣。”连长的话刚刚说完，立刻就有一堆人围了上来。他们是散布在阵地上各个角落的战士选出来的代表，他们拿着战士们亲手给毛主席写的信，冒着炮火，来到连部的坑道里的。他们争先恐后地把信往田正贵的口袋里、挂包里塞，还不断地说着战士们要田正贵捎给毛主席的话，一片闹嚷嚷的，弄到田正贵满头大汗，还是应接不暇。小通讯员贾庆普，认为自己是首先传了这个喜讯的人，有权特殊一点，他把信塞在田正贵的上衣口袋里，喊得也特别响：“老田，我这信，你可预防掉了，你见到咱们伟大领袖毛主席时，这只手和他握手，那只手就赶紧把我这信塞进他老人家的手里，再告诉他老人家一句话：‘贾庆普一定立功。’”
    这几个战士代表，还没有和田正贵把手握完，又有一堆人挤了上来。
    快到半夜时分田正贵才出现在营部的坑道里，这里又是兴奋的人群，狂热的欢呼和雪片似的信。
    电话铃又在不断哗哗地响，团里催田正贵快快起身，那里人们等着欢送呢！
    五连的战士们，选派了最精干，最有战斗经验的代表，带着战士们亲手写给毛主席的信，冒着炮火，从四面八方奔向营主峰的坑道，把一封封战士们的信，交给田正贵，要他亲手交给我们敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    五连的代表刚刚退后去，六连的代表们又涌上来了。
    夜里十二点，田正贵从同志们握手祝贺和托他带信的人们嘱咐的欢腾里，带着鼓鼓的一挂包信，不，是许许多多的战士们为和平而战斗的勇敢的心，走出营主峰的坑道。这时，后面还有人高高地举着信，喊着：“田正贵，你等等！”满头大汗地奔下山来，又把一叠信塞在田正贵的手里。
    田正贵正在兴奋地向团部进发，突然，迎面来了几个骑马的人，高声问道：“来的是田正贵同志吗？”“是呀！”田正贵真没想到这里又有人喊他的名字。“好极啦，真巧，我们刚刚赶到这里。”原来炮兵连知道这消息时，已经很晚了，他们耽心到营主峰去恐怕来不及了，就选派了代表骑着马分批赶到田正贵可能走过的几条路上等着。他们下了马
    一边争着和田正贵握手，一边说道：“我们来不及写信了，田正贵同志，你见了毛主席，就请告诉他老人家一句话：‘炮兵连一定在战斗中立功，为祖国和他老人家争取更大的荣誉’。”
    夜里下两点，田正贵出现在团部的坑道礼堂里。团首长、团直属各单位的代表，各营的代表，以及师里派来接他的文工队的队员们，已经是从天黑等到现在了。团首长握着他的手，为他祝贺，亲切地嘱咐着。各单位的代表把战士们亲手写给毛主席的信，郑重地交给他。歌声、锣鼓声和人们的欢呼声交织成一片：“光荣啊！立功的同志田正贵！”“向祖国问好！”“向我们敬爱的领袖毛主席问好！”田正贵在人们热烈的欢送中离开团部。
    田正贵，一个在旧社会尝尽了辛酸的人，做梦也没料到会有今天：首长们对他的关心，同志们对他的信任，装满了挂包和口袋的几百封信，还有，不几天，他就要看到的北京、天安门、毛主席……这新生活给他的荣誉，使他兴奋，感动……他的心情，正像他自己说的：“无法形容”。
    当他快到师部时，天要大亮了，东方升起了一轮红日，那万道彩霞，照耀着朝鲜的美丽河山，也照耀着我们的狙击手，就要回到祖国去的一个普通的战士——田正贵。
