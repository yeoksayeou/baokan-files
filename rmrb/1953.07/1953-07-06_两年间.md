    Two Years
    By our reporter Gu Weijin
    Xiliang Village, Fourth District, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, was liberated in 1947 and carried out land reform in 1948. After that, some farmers spontaneously engaged in seasonal mutual aid and labor exchange according to past habits. In 1951, under the leadership of the Party, a mutual aid group of five households was organized. By 1952, it had developed into an agricultural production cooperative. I once studied with some district and village cadres why the village was able to establish a relatively good agricultural production cooperative in just two years. This is mainly because their working methods conformed to the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and the village's mutual aid and cooperation movement developed under certain special conditions.
    
    Wu Chun'an and his mutual aid group
    Wu Chun'an, deputy secretary of the Xiliang Village Party branch and a well-known cotton yield model worker in Shanxi Province, is the leader of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Xiliang Village. He is 45 years old this year. He fled famine from his native Wuyang County, Henan Province, at the age of thirteen and worked for landlords here for more than 20 years. After the liberation of Xiliang Village, he served as the head of the poor peasant league and chairman of the farmers' association, actively leading the peasants to fight the landlords and obtain the fruits of liberation. Wu Chun'an said: "This is the first liberation. The second liberation is to get organized. However, the landlord and feudal forces have not completely collapsed, and there is still struggle." So he talked about the process of getting organized from the characteristics of the residual landlord and feudal forces in the late liberated areas.
    
    In the face of constant rumors and sabotage by the residual feudal forces, Wu Chun'an, in response to the Party's call, began to organize mutual aid groups in 1951. It was very difficult at the time. Landlord Li Yongshou spread rumors saying: "If you get organized, some people will farm, and some will become soldiers. It's still Yan Xishan's way. Whoever isn't afraid can join." Some liberated peasants, such as Zhao Hongdi, did not dare to join the mutual aid group after hearing these rumors. In the end, Wu Chun'an only mobilized three Party members and one member of the masses, a total of five households, to form a mutual aid group.
    
    This mutual aid group had little influence among the masses at the time and was often ridiculed by landlords. They said, "Let's see how long they can last." But Wu Chun'an was not discouraged. He knew from the Party's instructions that to consolidate and expand the mutual aid group, it was necessary to increase production, increase income, and set an example. To achieve this, it was necessary to implement the policy of combining organization with technological improvement.
    
    Wu Chun'an had heard people talk about the news of Qu Yaoli's high cotton yield published in the Shanxi Daily in the winter of 1950. He thought: The land in our village is very fertile and it is also a cotton-producing area. However, why can each mu of paddy field only yield 300 jin of seed cotton at most, which is so much less than Qu Yaoli's cotton? To find out the truth, Wu Chun'an traveled three or four hundred li to Quzhuangtou Village in Jie County to visit Qu Yaoli. Qu Yaoli was not at home. Wu Chun'an interviewed the members of Qu Yaoli's mutual aid group about Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience, bought some S cotton seeds, returned home, and led the whole group to study and promote Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience. In the fall, the entire group's 60 mu of cotton yielded an average of 330 jin of seed cotton per mu, which was 150 jin more than the village's average yield of 180 jin per mu in previous years. Wu Chun'an's 5.8 mu of high-yield land yielded an average of 520 jin per mu, breaking the county's highest cotton yield record. Wu Chun'an was elected as a labor model in the county and district.
    
    The masses saw with their own eyes such a fact: the cotton in the mutual aid group had a bumper harvest, and the average annual income per person was nearly doubled compared to the past (the average annual income per person in the past was equivalent to 1,300 to 1,400 jin of wheat, and now it has reached more than 2,200 jin). Three households used to lack grain for several months each year, but now they do not lack grain. The masses began to change their past views on Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group: in the past, they thought that the superiority of organization promoted by Wu Chun'an was "bragging", but now they often approached Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group to inquire about how they carried out equivalent mutual benefit, work point calculation, long-term planning, short-term arrangements, etc. Five households of liberated farmhands joined Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group. The mutual aid group expanded from five households to ten households. In winter, Wu Chun'an led the mutual aid group to carry out propaganda and education on getting organized in the village, and 34 households of the masses spontaneously organized five mutual aid groups.
    
    Experimenting with small-scale cooperatives
    One year after the establishment of Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group, it began to experiment with agricultural production cooperatives.
    
    Before liberation, there were 28 households in Xiliang Village, with 30 to 40 farmhands. After liberation, some farmhands left the village, and 19 farmhands participated in the land reform, were allocated land and houses, and settled in the village, making it 47 households. The ten members of Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group were part of the settled farmhands. Five of these ten members joined the mutual aid group, their income nearly doubled compared to the past, and their living difficulties were basically solved. Some of the five new members who joined the mutual aid group still had living difficulties, but they were solved by mutual borrowing and mutual assistance within the mutual aid group. Now all ten households are demanding to further develop production, and they have superior conditions for developing production: fertile land, abundant cotton and wheat production; each liberated farmhand has been allocated an average of more than eight mu of land, and nine out of ten households have livestock (mainly mules and horses) and carts. However, how to use these superior conditions to develop production? Among the ten liberated farmhands, five are Party member cadres. They have studied Comrade Gao Gang's "Report on the Direction of Rural Economic Development" during Party rectification and know that the countryside will move from mutual aid to cooperation in the future. They have also heard about the achievements of labor models Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en's agricultural production cooperatives promoted by county and district cadres, and they know that cooperatives are much better than mutual aid groups. On this basis, most people feel that they should set up cooperatives to develop production. They said: "Since mutual aid was carried out and technology was improved, production has greatly increased in just one year. If we set up cooperatives, plant according to the land, fertilize according to the land, use labor in a unified way, and combine it with technological improvement, production will inevitably increase further." However, a small number of people are still unclear about whether setting up cooperatives can further increase production; however, they believe that there will be a way to work with Wu Chun'an. After the land reform, Zhu Guang'an's class consciousness had not yet been raised, and he was tempted by the landlord in various ways. Wu Chun'an remembered that Zhu Guang'an had fought guerrillas with him and carried out land reform together, and was a very good peasant, so he said to him: "There is no way out to follow the landlord. If you lack food, I will lend it to you. If your house is not enough to live in, I will help you adjust it." Zhu Guang'an received Wu Chun'an's sincere help and education, realized the landlord's sinister methods, and became enlightened. Now when he mentioned setting up a cooperative, he said: "We believe in Wu Chun'an. If he says that setting up a cooperative will succeed, we will do it."
    
    Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group raised the request to set up a cooperative to the leaders of the county and special district. Initially, the leaders considered: Xiliang Village is a late liberated area, and Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group has only been established for one year and lacks experience. The landlord is constantly carrying out sabotage activities. Under these circumstances, setting up a cooperative may not succeed. They sent key cadres to Xiliang Village to investigate for half a month, and as a result, they discovered a new situation: 1. All ten households of Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group were from farmhand backgrounds, five of whom were Party member backbones. Because they established a mutual aid group, increased production, increased income, and gradually established collectivist thinking, they now demand to set up a cooperative, which is very natural; 2. Although they have not been in mutual aid for a long time, they have mastered the principle of mutual benefit, implemented the work point calculation system, and have some simple production plans, which has created favorable conditions for the cooperative; 3. Everyone has sufficient land and livestock, and has superior conditions for developing production. According to this situation, the leaders of the county and special district believe that Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group can experiment with setting up a cooperative.
    
    In order to ensure that the cooperative is run well, the county and special district transferred five group members, led by Wu Chun'an, to the special district for training in running a cooperative. Later, the Propaganda Minister of the County Committee and the Secretary of the District Committee and other key cadres helped Wu Chun'an establish the cooperative. They firmly grasped the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and relatively smoothly solved many problems. The following are some examples mentioned by the members of the cooperative.
    
    When discussing land shares, activists Niu Huanming and Xu Huaiyi were not very active, especially Niu Huanming, who was dejected and rarely spoke. Everyone couldn't figure out what was going on. After investigation, it was learned that Xu Huaiyi's wife thought that land shares were "eating from the big pot" and resolutely refused to let Xu Huaiyi put the land in as a share. Niu Huanming's wife is the daughter of Xu Huaiyi's wife, and she was influenced by her mother and was also unwilling to put the land in as a share. Niu Huanming criticized her for following her backward mother and having no future, but she said to Niu Huanming: "If you put the land in as a share, we will get a divorce." After learning about this situation, the cooperative studied the causes of this problem. It turned out that when discussing land shares, they only asked the heads of households to participate, and did not think of obtaining the consent of the family. Wu Chun'an helped these two households hold family meetings, explaining the policy of setting up a cooperative and the method of dividing profits from land shares. After everyone understood the principles, they all agreed to land shares.
    
    After this incident, in order to implement the principle of voluntariness from the individual (i.e., the head of household) to the family, the cooperative decided to adopt the method of "individual agreement, family agreement, everyone agreement" when discussing all issues in the future. From then on, the work of establishing the cooperative progressed smoothly.
    
    Learning and promoting advanced experience
    Wu Chun'an paid great attention to learning new farming methods. In January 1952, Wu Chun'an visited Qu Yaoli again to learn his advanced cotton planting experience. Qu Yaoli introduced a set of advanced experiences such as implementing close planting, topping, watering, and topdressing, which Wu Chun'an noted down one by one.
    
    At this time, Wu Chun'an's mutual aid group had been transformed into a cooperative. The cooperative mainly planted cotton. As long as the cotton had a bumper harvest, production could be increased, income could be increased, and the cooperative could be consolidated and expanded. Wu Chun'an combined Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience with the local specific conditions and made some improvements. For example, Qu Yaoli's cotton irrigation experience was "build ridges for irrigation, light irrigation, frequent irrigation." Wu Chun'an studied the benefits of this experience, saying that "light irrigation and frequent irrigation" can regularly supply cotton seedlings with appropriate moisture and promote the growth of cotton seedlings; the disadvantage is that "building ridges for irrigation" easily allows ice-cold well water to directly impact and damage the roots of cotton seedlings. Wu Chun'an also studied the local original irrigation method of "opening ditches for irrigation, heavy irrigation." Its advantage is that "opening ditches for irrigation" can surround the roots of cotton seedlings with soil, which is often dry and hot. Ice-cold well water seeps down through it, which will not damage the roots of cotton seedlings, which is very beneficial to the growth of cotton seedlings; the disadvantage is that "heavy irrigation" will make the cotton fields too wet, causing the cotton seedlings to only grow branches and leaves and not bear cotton bolls. Wu Chun'an studied both sides' irrigation experience and determined the method of "opening ditches for irrigation, light irrigation, frequent irrigation."
    
    In order to promote Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience in the cooperative, Wu Chun'an came up with many ways to educate the members. The members did not believe in the benefits of close planting, so Wu Chun'an helped the members to specifically calculate accounts (calculating plant spacing, row spacing, number of seedlings, etc.) so that the members believed that close planting could increase yield. Zhu Guang'an and others did not believe that light topping of cotton seedlings was better than heavy topping, so Wu Chun'an and they went to the cooperative's small farm to test the two topping methods. As a result, the wounds of the lightly topped cotton seedlings completely healed within two days, and the wounds of the heavily topped cotton seedlings could not heal within four days, which affected the normal growth of the cotton seedlings. In contrast, Zhu Guang'an said: "You can't call me to heavily top again in the future."
    
    Leading the mutual aid group forward
    Wu Chun'an's cooperative actively helped the five mutual aid groups in the village. The cooperative helped the mutual aid groups record work points and calculate accounts according to the principle of equivalent mutual benefit; helped the mutual aid groups formulate simple production plans; absorbed the mutual aid groups to participate in the cooperative's "Patriotic Day" to carry out patriotic and collectivist education; when the spring famine arrived, the mutual aid groups lacked food, and the cooperative loaned 1,400 jin of wheat to help them. All of this convinced the mutual aid groups of the cooperative's care and attention to them, and they began to unite around the cooperative.
    
    In order to help the mutual aid groups improve their farming techniques and strive for a bumper harvest in 1952, the cooperative called on the mutual aid groups to learn Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience. However, the mutual aid groups were unwilling to accept this experience. A view was circulating among them: "New methods are not reliable. Growing crops is not a joke. What will we eat if we don't grow grain? Old methods are better." They advocated using the old farming methods--more manure, frequent moving, etc.--to strive for a bumper harvest of crops in 1952.
    
    In order to educate the mutual aid groups to overcome conservative ideas with living people and living things, the cooperative launched a bumper harvest comparison competition with the mutual aid groups: comparing technology, comparing crops.
    
    During cotton sowing, the cooperative and the mutual aid group conducted the first comparison. The cooperative adopted a new method of sowing: soaking seeds in warm water and mixing seeds with medicine. The mutual aid group thought that soaking seeds in warm water would burn the cotton seeds, so they adopted the old method of mixing seeds with cold water and sowing early. Soon the cotton seedlings came out. The cooperative's cotton seedlings came out earlier, more evenly, and stronger. The mutual aid group sowed four or five days earlier than the cooperative, but the cotton seedlings came out four or five days later, unevenly, and the leaves were yellow. After the two sides visited and compared, they unanimously recognized that the cooperative's cotton seedlings were better than the mutual aid group's.
    
    However, the mutual aid group was not convinced of the cooperative's advanced experience. When the cotton bolls were being opened, the two sides conducted the second comparison. The cooperative adopted a new method of opening cotton bolls: opening all the cotton bolls twice, leaving two or three old leaves under the fruit branches to absorb nutrients and facilitate the development of cotton seedlings. The mutual aid group thought that this method was too slow and wasted time, so they adopted the old method of opening cotton bolls: opening all the cotton bolls once, leaving no old leaves under the fruit branches. A week later, the two sides visited and compared. The cooperative's cotton seedlings were developing normally and growing very fast. The mutual aid group's cotton seedlings were damaged and were half an inch lower than the cooperative's cotton seedlings.
    
    However, the mutual aid group was still not convinced of the cooperative's advanced experience. When hoeing the cotton fields, the two sides conducted the third comparison. The cooperative adopted a new method of hoeing: shallow hoeing. The mutual aid group thought that shallow hoeing could not remove the roots of the weeds, so they adopted the old method of hoeing: deep hoeing. Soon the two sides visited and compared. The cooperative's cotton seedlings were growing very luxuriantly. The mutual aid group's cotton seedlings were injured due to deep hoeing, and some were withered, half an inch lower than the cooperative's cotton seedlings.
    
    When the cotton was being topped, the mutual aid group thought that they had failed in the past three comparisons and began to believe in the new technology. Many people went to see how the cooperative was topping and followed suit. The head of the mutual aid group, Cheng Licai, used to resolutely resist the cooperative's new technology, but now he was embarrassed to go to the cooperative to learn, so he secretly sent some women to learn. After learning about this situation, the cooperative took the initiative to send people to teach Cheng Licai the technology.
    
    After that, the mutual aid groups followed the cooperative to learn new technologies for topdressing, irrigation, and fighting pests.
    
        That year, Wu Chun'an's cooperative had very high yields of wheat and cotton, and the members' incomes increased unprecedentedly, influencing other mutual aid groups to join the cooperative one after another.
    
    During the summer harvest, the village conducted a comparison of bumper wheat harvests (wheat suffered from windstorms at that time, and there was a poor harvest). The average yield of wheat per mu for individual households was 40 jin, with the highest being 65 jin. The average yield of wheat per mu for the mutual aid group was 51 jin, with the highest being 120 jin. The cooperative's wheat had the highest yield due to the implementation of new farming methods, with an average yield of 77 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 360 jin.
    
    After the bumper wheat harvest comparison, Yao Kejun, Liu Wanxiang and other mutual aid groups were brewing to join the cooperative. Everyone had such a feeling: "The soil quality and sunlight are the same, so why is the grain harvested by the two families as different as heaven and earth? A few people working together on crops doesn't count: the technology is not good, the labor is sparse, the plan is not well-thought-out, it's better to have more ways with everyone." So Yao Kejun, Liu Wanxiang and other ten households signed up to join the cooperative. After research, the cooperative approved nine households to join the cooperative.
    
    During the autumn harvest, the cooperative's cotton had a bumper harvest across the board. The whole society's 118.8 mu of paddy and dry cotton land harvested a total of 54,800 jin of seed cotton, and the average yield per mu exceeded the average yield of the mutual aid group in 1951 by 60 percent, exceeded the average yield of the mutual aid group in 1952 by 40 percent, exceeded the average yield of individual households by 150 percent, and exceeded the average yield of the best mutual aid group in the neighboring village by 62 percent. Among them, there were five mu of high-yield land, with an average yield of 1,021.3 jin of seed cotton per mu, setting a new record for cotton high yield in the province.
    
    The cooperative made a statistical analysis of the total annual income. The whole society's 294 mu of land (including 69 mu of paddy land) harvested 54,800 jin of seed cotton, 12,201 jin of miscellaneous grains, and 10,456 jin of wheat, totaling 161,155 jin of wheat. The whole society's ten households (the nine new households will not be allocated grain until next year, so they are not included in the calculation) with 34 people, each person received an average of 4,739 jin of wheat, exceeding the average income per person of the village's mutual aid group in 1952 by more than one time. The members of the cooperative received such abundant income and initially improved their lives. The whole society's ten households purchased a total of 18 bolts of fine cloth, more than 40 pairs of sneakers, rain shoes, and leather shoes, and added more than ten new quilts. In addition, the members of the cooperative loaned a total of more than 13 million yuan of unused money to the cooperative at low interest to purchase fertilizers and new agricultural tools in order to expand production next year.
    
    This spring, after studying the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, in order to strengthen management and consolidate the organization, Wu Chun'an's cooperative began to implement the "four fixes" system of contracting work and output from April.

    两年间
    本报记者　古维进
    山西省翼城县四区西梁村于一九四七年解放，一九四八年进行土地改革；之后，有些农民根据过去的习惯，自发地进行季节性的互助变工。一九五一年在党的领导下，组织了一个包括五户的互助组。到了一九五二年发展为农业生产合作社。我曾经和一些区村干部研究该村为什么能在短短的两年间办起较好的农业生产合作社。这主要是因为他们的工作方法符合中共中央关于农业生产互助合作决议的精神，而该村的互助合作运动，又是在一定的特殊条件下发展起来的。
    吴春安和他的互助组
    西梁村中共支部副书记、山西省著名棉花丰产劳动模范吴春安，是西梁村互助合作运动的领导者。他现年四十五岁，从十三岁起，由原籍河南省武阳县逃荒到这里，给地主作了二十多年工。西梁村解放后，他当过雇贫团长和农会主席，积极领导农民斗争地主，分得翻身果实。吴春安说：“这是第一个翻身。第二个翻身就是组织起来。但是，地主封建势力没有全垮，还有斗争。”于是他从晚解放区地主封建势力残存的特点谈到组织起来的经过。
    在封建残余势力不断进行造谣、破坏的情况下，在一九五一年，吴春安响应党的号召，开始组织互助组。当时是很困难的。地主李永寿造谣说：“组织起来，有人种地，有人当兵，还是阎锡山的一套，谁不怕就进去吧。”赵洪弟等翻身农民听了这种谣言，就不敢参加互助组了。最后吴春安只动员了三个党员和一个群众，共计五户，组织了一个互助组。
    这个互助组当时在群众中没有什么影响，经常受到地主的嘲笑。他们说：“看他们能闹几天吧。”但是吴春安并没有灰心失望。他从党的指示里，知道要想巩固和扩大互助组，必须提高生产，增加收入，做出榜样；而要想做到这一点，就要贯彻组织起来和改良技术相结合的方针。
    吴春安曾经听人谈到一九五○年冬季山西日报刊登了曲耀离棉花丰产的消息。他想：本村的土地很肥沃，也是产棉区，但是，为什么每亩水地最多只能收到籽花三百斤，比曲耀离的棉花少收那么多呢？为了探听虚实，吴春安跑了三四百里地到了解县曲庄头村访问曲耀离。曲耀离没有在家。吴春安向曲耀离的互助组员访问了曲耀离的植棉经验，买了一些斯字棉籽，回到家里，领导全组学习和推广了曲耀离的植棉经验。秋季，全组六十亩棉花每亩平均收获籽花三百三十斤，比往年全村每亩平均产量一百八十斤多一百五十斤。吴春安的五亩八分丰产地，每亩平均产量五百二十斤，打破全县棉产的最高纪录。吴春安被选为县和专区的劳动模范。
    群众亲眼看到这样一件事实：互助组的棉花丰产了，每人全年平均收入比过去将近提高一倍（过去每人全年平均收入折麦一千三四百斤，现在达到二千二百余斤），全组五户过去每年至少有三户缺少几个月的粮食，现在却不缺少粮食了。群众对于吴春安互助组开始改变了过去的看法：过去他们认为吴春安宣传的组织起来的优越性是“吹”的，现在他们都经常接近吴春安互助组，打听他们怎样进行等价互利、记工算账、长计划短安排等。有五户翻身雇工参加了吴春安互助组。互助组由五户扩大到十户。冬季，吴春安领导互助组在全村进行组织起来的宣传教育，有三十四户群众自动组织了五个互助组。
    试办小型合作社
    吴春安互助组成立一年以后，开始试办农业生产合作社。
    西梁村在解放前有二十八户，有三、四十个雇工。解放后，有些雇工离开了这个村子，有十九个雇工参加了土地改革，分到土地房屋，在村里落了户，这就成了四十七户。吴春安互助组的十户成员，就是落了户的雇工的一部分。这十户成员中的五户参加了互助组，收入比过去将近提高了一倍，生活上的困难基本上解决了；新参加互助组的五户，有的生活虽然还有困难，但在互助组内实行互借互济解决了。现在全组十户都要求进一步地发展生产，而他们又有发展生产的优越条件：土地肥沃，盛产棉花和小麦；每个翻身雇工平均分得八亩多土地，十户里九户有牲口（主要是骡马）、大车。但是，怎样运用这些优越条件以便发展生产呢？在十户翻身雇工中，有五户是党员干部，他们在整党中学习过高岗同志的“农村经济发展方向的报告”，知道农村今后要由互助走向合作的道路。他们也曾听过县、区干部宣传的劳动模范李顺达和郭玉恩的农业生产合作社的成绩，知道合作社比互助组优越得多。在这个基础上，大部分人感到要发展生产应该办合作社。他们说：“自从互助起来，改良了技术，只一年时间，生产就比从前大大提高，要是办了合作社，因地种植，因地施肥，统一使用劳动力，结合改良技术，生产必然还要提高。”但是，有小部分人对于办合作社能否进一步提高生产，还是认识不明确的；不过，他们相信和吴春安在一块就有办法。朱广安在土地改革后，阶级觉悟还未提高，受到地主各方面的引诱。吴春安想起朱广安曾经和自己一块打游击，一块进行土地改革，是个很好的农民，就对他说：“跟上地主走没有出路。你缺少粮食，我借给你，你的房子不够住，我帮助你调剂。”朱广安得到吴春安真诚的帮助与教育，认识到地主的阴险手段，就觉悟过来了。现在提起办合作社，他就说：“咱相信吴春安，他说办社能成，咱就干。”
    吴春安互助组把办合作社的要求提到县和专署的领导方面。开始，领导方面考虑：西梁村是个晚解放区，吴春安互助组成立不过一年，还缺乏经验，地主又不断进行破坏活动，在这种情形下，办合作社未必能成。他们派出主要干部在西梁村调查了半个月，结果发现一种新的情况：一、吴春安互助组十户都是雇工出身，其中有五户是党员骨干。他们由于成立互助组，提高了生产，增加了收入，集体主义思想逐渐树立起来，现在要求办合作社，这种要求是很自然的；二、他们互助的时间虽然不长，但是掌握互利的原则，实行了记工算账制度，又有一些简单的生产计划，这就给合作社创造了有利条件；三、大家都有充足的土地和牲口，具有发展生产的优越条件。根据这种情况，县和专署的领导方面认为吴春安互助组可以试办合作社。
    为了保证把合作社办好，县和专署抽调以吴春安为首的五户组员，到专署受了办合作社的训练。以后，县委会派宣传部长和区委书记等主要干部帮助吴春安建立合作社。他们紧紧地掌握着自愿和互利的原则，较顺利地解决了许多问题。下面就是社员谈到的一些事例。
    讨论土地入股时，积极分子牛焕明和许怀义很不积极，特别是牛焕明，垂头丧气，很少发言。大家都摸不清这是怎么回事。经过调查，才知道许怀义的妻以为土地入股是“吃大锅饭”，坚决不让许怀义把土地入股。牛焕明的妻是许怀义的妻的女儿，她受到母亲的影响，也不愿意把土地入股。牛焕明批评她跟上落后的母亲走没有出息，她却对牛焕明说：“你要是把土地入股，咱俩就离婚。”社里了解了这个情况后，就研究产生这个问题的原因。原来讨论土地入股时，光叫家长参加，没有想到还要取得家庭的同意。吴春安帮助这两户开了家庭会议，说明办合作社的政策和土地入股分红的办法。大家把道理弄清楚，都同意土地入股了。
    这件事情发生后，社里为了把自愿的原则由个人（即家长）贯彻到家庭，决定以后讨论一切问题，都采取“个人通，家庭通，大家通”的办法。从此建立合作社的工作就进展的顺利了。
    学习和推广先进经验
    吴春安对于学习新的耕作方法是非常注意的。一九五二年一月，吴春安又去访问曲耀离，学习他的植棉先进经验。曲耀离介绍了实行密植、打顶，浇水、上追肥等一套先进经验，吴春安一一记在心上。
    这时候吴春安互助组已经转为合作社，合作社主要种植棉花，只要棉花丰产，就可以提高生产，增加收入，巩固和扩大合作社。吴春安把曲耀离的植棉先进经验和本地的具体情况结合起来，并且作了若干改进。例如，曲耀离的棉花灌溉经验是“筑畦浇、轻浇勤浇”。吴春安研究这个经验的好处是“轻浇勤浇”可以经常供给棉苗以适当水份，促进棉苗的生长；不好的地方是“筑畦浇”容易使冰凉的井水直接冲击过来，损伤棉苗的根部。吴春安又研究本地原来的“开沟浇、重浇”的灌溉方法。它好的地方是“开沟浇”可以使棉苗的根部围土，这层土经常是干热的，冰凉的井水经过它渗透下去，就不会损伤棉苗的根部，这对于棉苗的生长很有好处；不好的地方是“重浇”会使棉田过于潮湿，使棉苗只长枝叶不结棉桃。吴春安把双方的灌溉经验加以研究，确定了“开沟浇、轻浇勤浇”的方法。
    吴春安为了在社里推广曲耀离的植棉先进经验，想出许多办法教育社员。社员不相信密植的好处，吴春安就帮助社员具体算账（计算株距、行距、苗数等），使社员相信密植能够提高产量。朱广安等不相信棉花轻打顶比重打顶好，吴春安就和他们到合作社的小农场试验两种打顶方法，结果，轻打顶的棉苗两天内伤疤完全长好，重打顶的棉苗四天内伤疤还长不住，影响棉苗的正常生长。对比之下，朱广安说：“以后叫我重打也不重打了。”
    领导互助组前进
    吴春安合作社积极帮助村里的五个互助组。合作社根据等价互利的原则，帮助互助组记工算账；帮助互助组制订简单的生产计划；吸收互助组参加合作社的“爱国日”，对他们进行爱国主义与集体主义的教育；当春荒到来，互助组缺乏粮食，合作社又贷出小麦一千四百斤加以接济。这一切使互助组都确信合作社对他们的关心和照顾，因而开始团结在合作社的周围。
    合作社为了帮助互助组提高耕作技术，争取一九五二年的丰产，号召互助组学习曲耀离的植棉先进经验。但是，互助组不愿意接受这个经验。他们里头流行着一种论调：“新办法，不可靠，种庄稼不是开玩笑，打不下粮食吃什么，还是老办法好。”他们主张用旧的耕作方法——多上粪，勤动弹等——争取一九五二年的庄稼丰产。
    合作社为了以活人活事教育互助组克服保守思想，和互助组展开丰产评比竞赛：比技术，比庄稼。
    棉花播种时，合作社和互助组进行第一次评比。合作社采用新的办法播种：温汤浸种，药剂拌种。互助组认为温汤浸种会把棉籽烧坏，而采用旧的办法，以凉水拌种和早种。不久棉苗出来了，合作社的棉苗出的又早、又齐、又壮，互助组比合作社早播种四五天，棉苗却迟出了四五天，出的高低不齐，叶子发黄。双方经过参观评比，一致公认合作社的棉苗比互助组的好。
    但是互助组并不服气合作社的先进经验，棉花脱花裤时，双方进行第二次评比。合作社采用新的办法脱花裤：二次把花裤脱完，果枝下面保留二三片老叶，以吸收养分，便于棉苗发育。互助组认为这种作法太慢，浪费时间，采用旧的办法脱花裤：一次把花裤脱完，果枝下面不留老叶。一星期后，双方进行参观评比，合作社的棉苗发育正常，长的很快，互助组的棉苗发育受到损伤，比合作社的棉苗低了半寸。
    但是互助组还是不服气合作社的先进经验。锄棉花地时，双方进行第三次评比。合作社采用新的办法锄地：浅锄，互助组认为浅锄不能把草根除净，采用旧的办法锄地：深锄。不久双方进行参观评比，合作社的棉苗长的很茂盛，互助组的棉苗由于深锄伤了虚根，有些萎缩，比合作社的棉苗又低了半寸。
    棉花打顶的时候，互助组想到过去三次评比都失败了，开始相信新的技术了。许多人去看合作社怎样打顶，自己跟着干起来。互助组长程立才过去坚决抵抗合作社的新技术，现在不好意思到合作社里学习，暗暗派了几个妇女去学习。合作社了解这种情况后，主动派人向程立才传授技术。
    以后，凡是上追肥、灌溉、和害虫作斗争，互助组都跟着合作社学习新技术。
        这一年，吴春安合作社的小麦、棉花产量很高，社员的收入空前增加，影响其他互助组先后参加了合作社。
    夏收，村里进行小麦丰产评比（当时小麦遭了风灾，歉收）。单干户的小麦每亩平均产四十斤，最高的六十五斤。互助组的小麦每亩平均产五十一斤，最高的一百二十斤。合作社的小麦由于实行新的耕作方法，产量最高，每亩平均产七十七斤，最高的达三百六十斤。
    小麦丰产评比后，姚克俊、刘万祥等互助组酝酿参加合作社。大家都有这样的感觉：“同样的土质、阳光，为什么两家打下的庄稼天上差到地下呢？三几个人在一块闹庄稼不算话：技术不成，劳力稀松，计划不周，还是跟大伙一块办法多。”于是姚克俊、刘万祥等十余户报名参加了合作社。合作社经过研究，批准九户入社。
    秋收，合作社的棉花全面丰产。全社一一八亩八分水旱花地，共收籽花五四、八○○斤，每亩平均产量超过一九五一年互助组平均产量的百分之六十，超过一九五二年互助组平均产量的百分之四十，超过单干户平均产量的百分之一百五十，超过邻村最好的互助组的平均产量百分之六十二。其中有五亩高额丰产地，每亩平均产籽花一○二一点三斤，创造全省棉花丰产新纪录。
    合作社把全年的总收入作了一统计。全社二九四亩土地（内水地六九亩），收获籽花五四、八○○斤，杂粮一二、二○一斤，小麦一○、四五六斤，共折小麦合一六一、一五五斤。全社十户（新参加的九户明年才分粮，不计算在内）三十四人，每人平均分得小麦四七三九斤，超过一九五二年本村互助组每人平均收入的一倍以上。社员得到这样丰富的收入，初步改善了生活。全社十户共购细布十八匹，球鞋、雨鞋、皮鞋共四十余双，添购新被子十余条。另外社员把花不完的钱共一千三百余万元低利贷给合作社购买肥料和新式农具，以便明年扩大生产。
    今年春天，吴春安合作社学习中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议后，为了加强经营管理，巩固组织，从四月份起，开始实行包工包产的“四定”制度。
