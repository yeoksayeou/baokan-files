Doing a Good Job in the Allocation of College Graduates
Xu Aiyun Chen Lihuo

College graduates are an important force in our country's construction endeavors. Over the past three years, they have played a significant role in various positions. Some graduates have made creations and inventions in their work, have been selected as advanced producers, or have been recognized as model workers.

On the issue of allocating graduates, the vast majority of government agencies and enterprise departments have adopted a serious attitude and have been able to assign them appropriate jobs as much as possible, allowing them to fully exert their strength in their work. However, some departments have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards this task, failing to reasonably arrange the specific work of the graduates. For example, when a certain agency in South China allocated a batch of graduates last year, it actually assigned them jobs by calling out names according to the order of the list: numbers one to five go here, numbers five to ten go there. Some names were missed, and some names were repeated. When the students raised questions, the responsible comrade simply made a check mark with a pen and considered it done. The Personnel Section of a certain factory under the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry of the Central People's Government, without understanding the situation of the graduates and the actual needs of the factory, simply distributed them evenly, resulting in electrical engineering majors being assigned to manage materials, and machine majors being assigned to install electric furnaces, creating a situation where what was learned did not match what was used. Some units blindly requested personnel from the personnel departments. For example, one unit requested a batch of people from the leading organs, but when everyone arrived there, not only had the factory not been established, but even the factory site had not been determined. For another example, last year the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry originally requested that a batch of better-quality graduates be assigned to the Yangxin Copper Mine, but when the graduates were assigned there, they said that the organization had not yet been established.

This kind of blind request for personnel and blind allocation of cadres has already caused a great waste of talent.

Some departments have serious shortcomings in receiving graduates. For example, some units let the graduates assigned there stay in the guesthouse for as long as two months; some units let the graduates assigned there stay in the guesthouse, neither assigning them work nor issuing subsidies, but instead requiring them to pay for meals. This has aroused their dissatisfaction.

Some departments have neither conducted good ideological education for the assigned graduates nor have they tried to improve their professional skills. For example, some departments have not taken the lead in the internship work of apprentice technicians, forming a situation of no one in charge. Some departments do not trust the assigned graduates and cannot use them boldly, believing that they cannot solve any problems, so they let them do tasks such as copying cards and moving bricks. This has caused many graduates to feel uneasy in their positions.

In addition, some departments and units have adopted an indifferent attitude towards the difficult problems raised by graduates. Some responsible comrades always think that these are just trivial matters, neither explaining to the other party nor actively trying to solve the difficulties that can be solved for the other party. For example, Wu Xunyi, who was assigned to Anhui United Transportation Company, requested a loan from the administration because his father was seriously ill, but the head of the personnel section of the company repeatedly prevaricated and suppressed Wu Xunyi's report. Lin Bihuang, who was assigned to work at the North China Coal Mine Administration, requested to transfer his spouse, but a secretary in the planning department kept his report in a drawer for four months. Several students who were assigned to the Shanxi Provincial Department of Culture and Education requested the leaders to repair the house because the dormitory was damp, but the answer was: "Limited by the system, it cannot be done." As a result, they all became ill due to the dampness. The leadership of some units believes that people who raise personal opinions are ideologically backward, and therefore treat them with a rude attitude. For example, a cadre in the personnel section of a certain bureau in South China pointed at a graduate student who was unwilling to go to the field and said: "Not going to the field is not revolutionary, and not revolutionary is counter-revolutionary!" Some departments adopted the method of getting rid of "burdens" by sending them away.

We believe that the reasons for the above phenomena are mainly: first, the leading comrades of some departments lack a full understanding of the issue of rational use of talent; second, the responsible comrades of some departments underestimate the ability of young cadres, thinking that "college students are nothing more than that" and cannot play a big role.

In order to do a good job in the allocation of graduates in the future, so that every graduate can play the greatest role in the construction of the motherland, we hereby put forward the following suggestions:

First, we must use cadres rationally, allocate jobs according to the specific situation of each graduate student, and try to meet the requirements of matching learning with application.

Second, after the graduate students arrive at their work posts, the relevant units should provide appropriate care in their lives. At any time, help them solve some problems in life and thought, so that they feel the warmth of the revolutionary family and work with peace of mind.

Third, we should take a responsible attitude towards the demands and actual difficulties raised by graduate students. For some problems that can be solved, we should be responsible for solving them in a timely manner; if they cannot be solved for the time being, we should explain clearly to the other party; if we encounter unreasonable or not entirely reasonable opinions and requirements, we must patiently explain them. We oppose the practice of casually labeling people with the hat of "individualism."

Fourth, we should attach importance to the training of new staff, strengthen the organization and leadership of internship work; we must actively help them politically to improve the political consciousness and professional level of young cadres.

Fifth, we should always pay attention to understanding the ideological situation of graduate students, and solve their ideological problems in a timely manner, so that their emotions are always full and they work actively. We oppose those ideas that think that after the allocation of work, everything will be fine. We can hold symposiums to listen to their opinions on work and leadership, as well as their personal requirements, so that we can find ways to solve some problems that can be solved in a timely manner and encourage their work enthusiasm.

    做好高等学校毕业生的分配工作
    徐爱云　陈丽火
    高等学校毕业生是我国建设事业中的一支重要力量。三年来，他们在各种岗位上发挥了很大的作用。有些毕业生在工作中有了创造、发明，被评选为先进生产者，或被评为模范工作者。
    在分配毕业生的工作问题上，绝大多数的政府机关和企业部门采取了郑重的态度，能够尽可能地给他们分配适当的工作，使他们在工作中充分发挥力量。但也有些部门对这一工作采取了官僚主义的态度，没有合理地安排毕业生的具体工作。例如，华南某机关在去年分配一批毕业生的工作时，竟按照名单的排列次序去点名分配：一号至五号到这里，五号至十号到那里。有的名字漏掉了，有些名字重复了。当同学提出质询时，负责同志只是拿笔一勾便算了事。中央人民政府第二机械工业部某厂人事科，不去了解毕业生的情况和本厂的实际需要，竟把他们平均分配下去，结果把学电机的派去管材料，把学机器的派去装置电炉，造成了学用不一致的现象。有的单位盲目地向人事部门要人。例如，有一个单位向领导机关要了一批人，可是当大家到那里的时候，不仅工厂尚未建立起来，甚至连厂址也还没有确定。又如，去年中央人民政府重工业部，原要求分配一批质量较好的毕业生给阳新铜矿，但当毕业生分配到那里时，说机构尚未成立起来。
    这种盲目地要人、盲目地分配干部的现象，已造成人材使用上的很大浪费。
    有些部门在接待毕业生的工作方面有严重的缺点。如有的单位让分配到那里去的毕业生住在招待所里长达两月之久；有的单位让分配去的毕业生住在招待所里，既不分配工作，又不发给津贴，反而要他们缴纳伙食费。这样就引起了他们的不满情绪。
    有些部门对分配去的毕业生既没有很好地进行思想教育，也没有设法提高他们的业务水平。例如有些部门对见习技术员的见习工作，没有领导起来，形成无人管的现象。有些部门不信任分配去的毕业生，不能放手地使用他们，认为他们不能解决什么问题，因此就让他们作抄卡片、搬运砖头等类的工作。这就使许多毕业生产生了不安于岗位的情绪。
    此外，有些部门、单位对毕业生所提出的困难问题，采取了漠不关心的态度。有些负责同志总是认为这只是一些小事，既不向对方进行解释，也不积极设法给对方解决可能解决的困难。例如分配到安徽联运公司的吴训义，因父亲患重病，要求行政方面借给钱，但该公司人事科长竟一再推诿，把吴训义写的报告压了下来。分配到华北煤矿管理局工作的林必煌，要求调动爱人，计划处的一个秘书竟把他的报告放在抽屉里达四个月之久。分配到山西省文教厅的几个同学，因宿舍潮湿，要求领导方面把屋子修理一下，但回答却是：“限于制度，不能办到。”结果他们因受到潮湿的侵袭都生了病。有些单位的领导方面认为提出个人意见的人，都是思想落后，因而用粗暴的态度去对待他们。例如华南某局人事科有一个干部指着不愿到现场去工作的毕业同学说：“不下场就是不革命，不革命就是反革命！”有的部门采取丢“包袱”，把他们送走了事的办法。
    我们认为，产生上述种种现象的原因主要是：第一，有些部门的领导同志对合理使用人材的问题，缺乏充分的认识；第二，有些部门的负责同志轻视青年干部的能力，认为“大学生也不过如此”，起不了什么大作用。
    为了做好今后毕业生的分配工作，使每个毕业同学都能为祖国建设事业发挥最大的作用，我们在这里提出以下几点意见：
    第一，要合理地使用干部，根据每个毕业同学的具体情况分配工作，尽可能达到学用一致的要求。
    第二，毕业同学到达工作岗位后，有关单位在生活上应给予适当的照顾。随时帮助他们解决一些生活上、思想上的问题，使他们感到革命大家庭的温暖，安心工作。
    第三，对毕业同学提出的要求和实际困难，应采取负责的态度。对某些可能解决的问题，应负责地及时予以解决；倘一时不能解决，就应向对方解释清楚；如遇到不合理或不尽合理的意见和要求，必须耐心地进行解释。反对随便给人扣“个人主义”帽子的作法。
    第四，应重视对新的工作人员的培养，加强对见习工作的组织领导；在政治上要积极予以帮助，以提高青年干部的政治觉悟和业务水平。
    第五，应经常注意了解毕业同学的思想情况，及时解决他们的思想问题，使他们情绪经常饱满，积极工作。反对那些认为分配工作之后便“百事大吉”了的想法。可以召开座谈会，听取他们对工作和领导方面的意见及其个人的要求，这样才能及时设法解决一些可能解决的问题，鼓舞他们的工作情绪。
