    Xunyi County People Thank Government for Transporting Grain for Disaster Relief
    Reader Zheng Jiujing from Xunyi County, Shaanxi Province, writes: Grain transported from Harbin and other places arrived in the disaster areas of Henan and northern Shaanxi in early May. Our Xunyi County is one of them. Now the People's Government is distributing it and selling it at low prices. The people's hearts are at ease.
    Since the wheat was damaged by frost, some farmers cried out in sorrow. Some white-haired old men became very afraid when they talked about the famine during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in 1919, saying that the famine caused many families to become extinct, and many people died. For example, Zhengjia Village in Taiyu District originally had more than 150 households, but after that famine, only 42 households remained.
    After the grain was transported in, the masses deeply realized that with the People's Government, natural disasters can be overcome. Now the masses in the disaster areas are mostly taking active action, and under the leadership and help of the People's Government, they are preparing to overcome the summer famine and do a good job in autumn crops.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    栒邑县人民感谢政府运粮救灾
    陕西省栒邑县读者郑九经来信：从哈尔滨等地运来的粮食，已在五月初旬到达河南及陕西北部各个灾区了。我们栒邑县也是其中的一个。现在人民政府正在一面分配，一面廉价出售。群众的心安下来了。
    自从麦子受冻以后，有些农民难过得放声大哭。有的白发老头一谈起一九一九年国民党反动统治时的饥荒就非常害怕，说那次饥荒使许多人家灭种绝户，不知死了多少人。如太峪区的郑家村原有一百五十多户人口，那次灾荒后就只剩下四十二户了。
    食粮运来以后，群众深刻地认识到有了人民政府就能战胜自然灾害。现在各灾区的群众大都积极行动起来，在人民政府的领导和帮助下，正进行克服夏荒、搞好秋季作物的准备工作。
