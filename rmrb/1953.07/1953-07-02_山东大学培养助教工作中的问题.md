    Problems in Shandong University's Assistant Instructor Training
    Shandong University Academic Affairs Office School Journal Editorial Office
    On April 23rd, we invited assistant instructors from the university's College of Liberal Arts and College of Science to a forum to discuss problems in the university's assistant instructor training program. According to the assistant instructors, the first problem is that some departments' administrations do not pay enough attention to this work. For example, in the Department of Aquaculture, the training plan was drafted by the assistant instructors themselves, with the administration merely glancing at it. The word "training" is simply inapplicable. Furthermore, any course that no one else wants to teach is assigned to the assistant instructor, or they are simply encouraged to study political theory in order to become a "theoretical advisor" in the future. The Department of Chinese has a similar situation. Only after several urgings from the Academic Affairs Office did they begin to think about the problem of training assistant instructors, but they only assigned a few courses to the assistant instructors, without mentioning any specific training methods. In this regard, the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Russian, and History are doing relatively well; the departments have feasible training plans and can conduct training in conjunction with actual practice. However, the Department of History places too much emphasis on professional work and neglects political and ideological education, which is also a drawback.
    Secondly, a lack of clear direction is the most troubling thing for assistant instructors. According to the university's Academic Affairs Office plan, assistant instructors should start with basic courses for advanced study, but some departments open a large number of courses indiscriminately, without distinguishing between importance, making it impossible to know where to start. Some teachers in the Department of Chinese equate assistant instructors with professors, hoping that assistant instructors will teach as many courses as professors, or even use opening courses as a means to stump the assistant instructors. Therefore, the assistant instructors in the Department of Chinese are particularly anxious to clearly define the direction of training.
    In contrast to the above situation, the Department of Physics has a clear training plan, which stipulates that assistant instructors should be able to teach general physics courses independently in two years, and stipulates a set of progressive training methods, such as participating in tutoring, discussing Soviet textbooks, and holding trial lectures, etc.; however, there is no one dedicated to leading the assistant instructors' advanced studies. The Departments of Chinese, Botany, and Mathematics also have the same situation. In this regard, the Department of History has achieved relatively good results; all assistant instructors have participated in teaching organizations and have dedicated mentors.
    The assistant instructors in the Departments of Physics, Botany, Mathematics, and Aquaculture feel that the workload is too heavy, especially with too much experimental tutoring work, making them exhausted and unable to pursue advanced studies according to plan. Everyone feels that this is also a big problem. For example, assistant instructors in the Department of Mathematics work more than 71 hours a week, and some even work up to 86 hours. Excessive working hours affect their health. Ge Maochun, an assistant instructor in the Department of History, in addition to lecturing, also serves as the secretary of the "Literature, History, and Philosophy" magazine and also works for the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office and the trade union. As a result, due to insufficient preparation time, the teaching effect is affected, and students have raised many opinions.
    Speaking of the assistant instructors themselves, the unanimous opinion is that they must strive to take the initiative and actively seek help from the leadership, but they cannot have a dependent mentality. Assistant instructors in the Departments of Botany and History said that in the current situation where teaching organizations are not sound enough, assistant instructors must strive to take the initiative everywhere and cannot wait for others to train them. Otherwise, they will be like a graduate student in the Department of History who stayed in the department for a year and a half. The leadership had no time to take care of him, and he did not raise any opinions himself. As a result, he did not gain much in a year and a half.
    In order to gain more help from the leadership, everyone believes that, first of all, we must change the thinking of some assistant instructors who look down on professors. This kind of thinking exists in the Departments of Aquaculture and Mathematics. These assistant instructors feel that the professors' level is not high enough and that their lectures are just off the cuff. Therefore, they do not listen to the professors' lectures with an open mind, but instead specialize in finding mistakes. Everyone also pointed out that some professors are unwilling to pass on their skills to others, which is completely undesirable. However, this phenomenon has actually occurred in the Department of History. These professors still have "guild" thinking, thinking that passing on the "secrets" to others will affect their "business." Everyone hopes that these professors can quickly overcome their wrong thinking and make the best efforts to cultivate new teachers and build higher education.

    山东大学培养助教工作中的问题
    山东大学教务处校刊编辑室
    我们曾在四月二十三日邀请本校文学院和理学院的助教举行座谈会，研究本校培养助教工作中的问题。根据助教们的反映，我校培养助教工作中存在的第一个问题是有些系的行政方面对这项工作不够重视。例如水产系，连培养计划都是助教自己订的，行政方面不过看一眼而已，“培养”两字根本谈不上。另外，凡是没人开的课都拨给助教，甚或只愿助教学习政治理论，以便将来做“理论顾问”。中文系也有类似情形。只是在教务处几次督促之后，他们才开始想到培养助教的问题，但也只是给助教指定几门课程，至于具体的培养办法并没有提。在这方面，数学系、物理系、俄语系和历史系做得比较好，系里有可行的培养计划，并能结合实际进行培养。但历史系太偏重业务，忽略了政治思想教育，这也是一个缺点。
    其次，努力方向不够明确，是助教最头痛的事。按本校教务处计划，助教应从基础课着手进修，但有的系乱开了一大堆课，而且轻重不分，使人无从下手。中文系有的教师把助教和教授等量齐观，希望助教和教授开一样多的课，甚或以开课作为难倒助教的手段。所以中文系助教要求明白确定培养方向的心情特别急迫。
    和上述情形相反，物理系有着明确的培养计划，计划规定助教在两年后能够独立开普通物理课，并规定了一套循序渐进的培养办法，如参加辅导、讨论苏联教材以及举行试讲等等；但是对于助教的进修，没有专人领导。中文系、植物系、数学系也都有同样情形。在这方面，历史系做得较有成绩，所有助教都参加了教学组织，且都有专人指导。
    物理系、植物系、数学系和水产系的助教都感到工作过于繁重，特别是担任实验辅导工作太多，使人疲于奔命，很难按计划进修，大家觉得这也是很大的问题。例如数学系助教每周工作时间达七十一小时以上，有的多至八十六小时。因工作时间过多，影响了健康。历史系助教葛懋春除了讲课以外，还担任“文史哲”杂志社的秘书，还要作马克思列宁主义教研室和工会的工作。结果因为备课时间不够，影响了教学效果，同学提出很多意见。
    说到助教本身，大家一致的意见是：必须争取主动，积极争取领导方面的帮助，但不能有依赖思想。植物系和历史系的助教说：在目前教学组织还不够健全的情况下，助教们必须处处争取主动，不能静候别人来培养。否则就会像历史系的一位研究生那样，他在历史系住了一年半，领导方面无暇照顾他，自己也不提意见，结果在一年半的时间内没有多大收获。
    为了争取领导方面的更多帮助，大家认为，首先必须改变某些助教看不起教授的思想，这种思想在水产系和数学系都是存在的。这些助教觉得教授水平不够，讲课不过是信口开河，因而他们就不是虚心地去听教授讲课，而是专门去找错。大家也指出，有些教授不愿把本领传给别人的现象，也是完全不应有的。但是，这种现象竟在历史系发生过。这些教授，还存在着“行会”思想，以为把“秘诀”传给别人，就会影响了自己的“营业”。大家希望这些教授能够迅速克服自己的错误思想，为培养新的师资，建设高等教育作最善的努力。
