    In the Southwest, Rural Areas Handle Specific Problems in Policy Propaganda; Some Places Treat the Implementation of Policies as a Crash Campaign, with Poor Results

    In the rural areas of Southwest China, attention was paid to publicizing and implementing production policies during this year's spring plowing production, which further stabilized the production sentiment of all classes.

    In the past, the rural areas of Southwest China did not publicize policies, especially policies to protect farmers' ownership, deeply and widely enough; some areas had deviations in implementing policies, and the corrections of the deviations that had occurred were not thorough or timely. Therefore, all classes in rural areas had varying degrees of ideological concerns about developing production. Generally, they were afraid of raising their class status, afraid of others borrowing money, afraid of "eating from the same pot," and afraid of increasing burdens, leading to low production sentiment. In some places, serious phenomena such as damaging agricultural tools, starving cattle, abandoning land, and excessive eating and drinking had occurred. During spring plowing production, in response to the ideological conditions of the masses, and in combination with various agricultural activities, the policies of protecting farmers' ownership, freedom of borrowing, rewarding production, reasonable burden, and the three major principles of mutual assistance and cooperation were universally and repeatedly publicized and explained to all classes in rural areas through farmer representative meetings, production mobilization meetings, cadre meetings, and mass meetings; and some specific problems that had infringed on farmers' ownership in the past were properly handled, embodying the Party's policies with vivid real-life examples. When the policies truly met the masses, the ideological concerns of all classes in rural areas gradually disappeared. Gu Senyun, a middle peasant in Qinggang Township, Bishan County, Sichuan Province, took out a waterwheel that had been hidden for a long time and used it; Wang Weizhou originally wanted to sell the strong ox and exchange it for a small ox, but he didn't sell it at this time; Qinggang Village originally had more than 170 loads of "white water fields," but at this time, all of them were fertilized. After Qu Pu Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, clarified the policy of freedom of borrowing, the masses asked "how is it done?" Therefore, some debt problems were specifically handled. Luo Yongsen, the village chief of the eighth village of the township, owed more than one million yuan in debt; after listening to the policy propaganda, he immediately expressed his attitude at the cadre meeting: "After the spring harvest, first pay off the wages and fertilizer costs in the mutual aid group; after the summer harvest, pay back Lan Yucheng's one hundred kilograms of rice. I lost my credibility in the past, but now I'll make it clear." Under his influence, among the more than 40 debtor households in the village, 6 households immediately prepared to repay the debt, more than 20 households made plans for installment payments, and some debtor households also took the initiative to find creditor households to negotiate the repayment date, and some also negotiated interest rates agreed by both parties; therefore, the creditor households were also very satisfied, and some were willing to lend again. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued documents such as the "Instructions to Party Committees at All Levels on Spring Plowing Production," cadres in various places studied them and became more aware of the importance of implementing policies, and they checked their leadership thinking and rural work. The main experiences they gained in implementing policies are: the spirit of the policies should be explained repeatedly, continuously, accurately and widely, and should not be done as a crash campaign; in the propaganda, some specific problems should be solved on the premise of being conducive to unity and production, otherwise the masses will think that it is "just thunder and no rain"; to do this, the ideological concerns of the cadres must first be dispelled, and the masses must be influenced through the cadres.

    At present, there are still many areas in the Southwest where the work of publicizing and implementing policies is not done well enough. Some only focus on the guidance of production technology and forget the policies; some think that holding a conference, launching a campaign, and handling a problem will solve everything. Doing so is harmful and should be corrected.

    西南各地农村在宣传政策中处理具体问题
    有的地方把贯彻政策当做一个突击运动，效果不好
    西南各地农村，在今年春耕生产中，注意了宣传贯彻生产政策，进一步稳定了各阶层的生产情绪。
    西南区各地农村，过去对政策，特别是对保护农民所有权的政策，宣传得不够深入和广泛；某些地区在贯彻执行政策方面曾发生了一些偏差，对于已经发生的偏差纠正得也不彻底、不及时，因此，农村各阶层对发展生产都有不同程度的思想顾虑，一般是怕提高成分、怕别人借贷、怕“吃大锅饭”、怕加重负担，生产情绪低落；个别地方已发生破坏农具、饿死耕牛、丢荒土地、大吃大喝等严重现象。在春耕生产中，各地针对群众的思想情况，结合各种农事活动，普遍地把保护农民所有权、借贷自由、奖励生产、合理负担及互助合作的三大原则等政策，通过农民代表会、生产动员会、干部会、群众会等，通俗地、反复地向农村各个阶层进行了宣传解释；并且对过去侵犯农民所有权的一些具体问题加以妥善的处理，用生动的现实事例体现了党的政策。政策真正与群众见了面，逐渐消除了农村各阶层的思想顾虑。四川省璧山县青杠乡中农古森云把一架藏了许久的水车取出来使用；王维周本想把壮牛卖掉换小牛，这时也不卖了；青杠村原来有一百七十多挑“白水田”，这时全部都施上了肥料。四川省郫县屈浦乡讲清了借贷自由政策后，群众要求“看看是啷?（怎么）办的”，因此，又具体地处理了一些债务问题。该乡第八村村长罗永森欠了
    一百多万元的债；听了政策宣传以后，当即在干部会上表示态度：“小春收了后，先把互助组内的工资和肥料款还清；大春下来再还蓝玉成的一百斤米。过去失信用，现在说清楚。”在他的影响下，全村四十多户欠债户中，有六户立即准备还账，二十多户作了分期付还的计划，有的欠债户还主动找借出户协商还账的日期，有的并协商了双方同意的利息；因此，借出户也很满意，有的也愿意再借出来了。中共中央发表了“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”等文件后，各地干部都进行了学习，更加认识了贯彻政策的重要性，纷纷检查了领导思想和农村工作。他们在贯彻政策中得到的主要经验是：要反复地连续地准确地广泛地交代政策的精神，不要当成一个突击运动去做；在宣传中要在有利于团结和生产的前提下解决一些具体问题，否则群众就会认为是“光打雷不落雨”；要做到这样首先要解除干部的思想顾虑，通过干部去影响群众。
    目前西南还有不少地区对宣传贯彻政策的工作做的不够好，有的只抓了生产技术指导，忘了政策；有的认为开一个大会、发动一个运动、处理一个问题就可以万事大吉。这样做都是有害的，应当纠正。
