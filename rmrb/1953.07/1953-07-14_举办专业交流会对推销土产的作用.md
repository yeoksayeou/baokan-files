Since the beginning of 1953, Zhejiang Province has been deeply engaged in material exchange work. In addition to strengthening regular commercial purchase and sales activities and holding material exchange fairs, nearly thirty specialized meetings have been convened under the specific leadership of the government, focusing on solving the production and sales problems of major local products. Specialized meetings can be roughly divided into three types:

(1) Specifically understanding the production and sales situation of a certain local product, and studying specific issues such as production direction, specifications, and prices. Examples include the provincial-level specialized meetings on brown sugar, hogs, handmade paper, oils and fats, tobacco leaves, alum, domestic silk, medicinal materials, oil paper, and the Wenzhou alum meeting. These meetings invited representatives from all relevant parties involved in production, transportation, and sales to understand the production and sales situation, identify key problems, research solutions, and thoroughly solve the production and sales problems of local products.

(2) Solving the difficulties of slow sales of certain major local products. Examples include the specialized meetings on New Year goods, bamboo products, water chestnuts, rapeseed, etc. held in various places, and the provincial-level specialized meetings on handmade paper and bamboo pulp. Through the meetings, in addition to studying production and sales, quality, specifications, and price issues, new and old commercial relationships were sought or connected, direct exchanges were organized at the meetings, private merchants were encouraged to actively transport goods, and sales channels were expanded.

(3) For popular local products that are about to be launched on the market, negotiate the proportion of public and private purchases and properly arrange the market. Examples include the specialized meetings on fruits in Hangzhou, spring bamboo shoots in Ningbo, and the provincial-level meetings on domestic tea and raw silk. These meetings not only prevented the chaotic phenomena of panic buying and price increases that might occur after the local products were launched on the market, but more importantly, strengthened the organization and leadership of private merchants.

This type of professional exchange meeting has many advantages over general comprehensive exchange meetings: it can focus on one type of local product, concentrate the relevant forces in production and sales, thoroughly understand the production and sales situation, identify the key to the problem, and formulate specific solutions. General comprehensive exchange meetings have a wide scope and short duration, and can only meet temporary purchase and sales requirements, and many problems cannot be studied and resolved in time. The functions of this type of professional exchange meeting are as follows:

(1) Reasonably adjust the prices of local products and expand the sales channels of local products. Price adjustments must take into account the overall production and sales situation in order to avoid subjective, blind, and unprincipled price reductions. These issues can only be resolved through professional meetings. For example, the provincial-level brown sugar specialized meeting studied the changes in the production and sales situation of brown sugar nationwide, and calculated prices by referring to historical prices, production costs, and market conditions to solve sales problems. In 1952, Zhejiang's brown sugar production was 540,000 dan, more than double that of 1950. Guangdong's brown sugar increased by 50%, and its quality was good and the price was low. The commercial cost price of Guangdong Tizhuang green (brown sugar) transported to Shanghai was 240,000 yuan per dan, while the commercial cost price of Zhejiang brown sugar transported to Shanghai was 270,000 yuan per dan. Guangdong Shunde green (brown sugar) transported to Shanghai for sale had a gross profit of 10% to 20%, while Zhejiang Yiwu green (brown sugar) would lose money when transported to Shanghai based on the purchase price at the place of origin at that time. Therefore, the market shrank and private merchants were unwilling to transport it. On the other hand, the market price at the place of origin was already 17% lower than the listed price. Sugar farmers reflected: "We are not afraid of low prices, but we are afraid of not being able to sell." The main reason for this was that prices were controlled with a bureaucratic attitude in the past, and production costs were not accurately calculated. This is reflected in: First, the labor cost estimate was too high. Planting one mu of land required 24 to 26 man-days. The wage for each man-day varied. In mutual aid teams, it was six to seven jin of rice, while for individual households it was generally eight jin of rice, and in some cases ten jin of rice. The labor cost estimate was too high, and the purchase price was also too high. Second, the sugar production rate was set too low. For example, the sugar production rate per mu in Wenzhou was set at 500 jin, but the actual maximum yield was 800 jin, generally 600 jin, and in some cases more than 1,000 jin. Third, processing fees: the processing fee per dan of sugar was 69,420 yuan in Wenzhou, 86,300 yuan in Yiwu, and only 60,000 yuan in Guangdong. Due to insufficient understanding of the changes in the sharp increase in brown sugar production and the reduction in production costs, coupled with the idea of unilaterally taking care of the interests of farmers in mind, neglecting the profits of transporters, the purchase price was too high, resulting in a large backlog of brown sugar. After the brown sugar specialized meeting understood the above changes in the production and sales situation, it focused on adjusting prices, carefully calculated production costs and regional price differences, and adjusted wages according to the principle of "calculating the place of origin based on the place of sale" and "minority (output) referring to the majority," and unified wages in mutual aid teams to 7,000 yuan per man-day, equivalent to about seven to seven and a half jin of rice in the local rice price, thereby lowering the purchase price by 15% to 17% and lowering the selling price by 9% to 11%; and called for reducing production costs, increasing the output per unit area, and improving quality to expand and consolidate sales channels. After the meeting, the problem of slow sales of brown sugar was quickly solved even when the purchasing power of state-owned commercial enterprises was once weak.

(2) Because representatives from both production and sales parties are concentrated to focus on the problems of one type of local product, the problem of promotion can be combined with the problem of production to solve it. For example, the provincial-level meeting on handmade paper and bamboo pulp concluded 15 billion yuan of handmade paper transactions, solved the sales problem of some handmade paper, prepaid 3.9 billion yuan in deposits, and supported paper farmers in production; it also combined to study the production direction of handmade paper and bamboo pulp in 1953, and decided that cultural paper and sanitary paper in handmade paper would maintain the original production level, and superstitious paper would gradually reduce production. At the same time, it is necessary to improve the quality of handmade paper and appropriately reduce excessively high wages. The main problem with bamboo pulp is that it contains too much sand and damages the machines, and the general pulp yield is only 70%. The meeting researched that the key to improving quality is: 1. The material must be tender when cutting. 2. The amount of lime used should be kept at 10%; avoid mixing mud and sand into the material, and the color of the same grade must be consistent. 3. The future production policy is to reward Grade A, maintain Grade B, gradually reduce Grade C, and resolutely not produce Grade D.

(3) Combine the temporary exchange with the organization and leadership of regular commercial activities. Because the issues of production, promotion, prices, transportation, and capital were studied, on the one hand, the exchange business at the meeting proceeded smoothly; on the other hand, after the meeting, various forces were coordinated to implement the various methods studied at the meeting, thus promoting the supply and demand relationship of commodities to tend to normal, forming a combination of exchange meetings and regular commercial activities, and strengthening the organization and leadership of exchange meetings and regular commercial activities. For example, the effect of the brown sugar specialized meeting was mainly achieved through the implementation of price adjustments after the meeting. In Yuyao, 140 transactions were concluded for bamboo products at the meeting, and futures contracts were signed from January to June. Problems such as payment, price, specifications, and transportation of the contracts must be checked regularly during this period. It can be seen that the professional exchange meeting cannot be considered complete after the meeting is held, and many problems must be implemented after the meeting. In this way, the temporary exchange meeting is combined with the regular commercial organization leadership.

(4) Organize professional exchange meetings, where representatives from the two places of production and sales study the problems face-to-face, and everyone strives to open up new and old commercial relationships, and conduct transaction activities on this basis, so that the sales problems of certain major local products can be solved in a detailed manner, thereby driving the entire market to become active. Last year, the spring bamboo shoots in Ningbo were contracted by state-owned companies and cooperatives, and the sales channels were not opened. This year, through professional meetings, seven Shanghai firms stationed in Fenghua to purchase, the sales channels were opened, and the market was prosperous, directly solving the production and living problems of farmers. According to a typical survey in Aocun Village, Chengdong, Fenghua, the village has 180 households with 687 people. The promotion of spring bamboo shoots accounts for 75% of the total output. They bought 14 handcarts, 13 cattle, 60 piglets, and 5 million yuan worth of agricultural tools and fertilizers such as plows and harrows, more than 10 dan of grain, and also bought many industrial products, and stored 10 million yuan in the bank. The average income of the 20 handcarts in the village is more than 500,000 yuan. The farmers' living problems have been basically solved.

    举办专业交流会对推销土产的作用
    浙江省商业厅
    一九五三年度开始以来，浙江省各地深入开展了物资交流工作。除加强经常商业购销活动和召开物资交流会以外，并在政府具体领导下，召开了将近三十个专业性会议，有重点地解决了大宗土产的产销问题。专业性会议大致可分为三种性质：
    （一）专门了解一种土产的产销情况，研究生产方向、规格、价格等具体问题的。如省级召开的红糖、毛猪、土纸、油脂、菸叶、明矾、内销绸、药材、油纸及温州的明矾等专业会议。这些会议邀集了产、运、消有关各方面的代表，摸清产销情况，找出问题关键，研究解决办法，比较彻底地解决了土产的产销问题。
    （二）解决某些大宗土产的滞销困难的。如各地举行的年货、竹器、荸荠、菜籽等专业会议及省举行的土纸、竹浆等专业会议。通过会议，除了研究产销、品质、规格和价格问题外，并找寻或接上了新旧商业关系，在会上直接组织交流，推动私商积极贩运，扩大了销路。
    （三）为即将上市的畅销土产，协商公私收购比重，妥善安排市场的。如杭县的水果，宁波的春笋及省召开的内销茶、土丝等专业会议。这些会议不但防止了土产上市后可能发生的抢购、抬价等混乱现象，更主要的是加强了对私商的组织与领导。
    这种专业交流会，比一般综合性交流会有许多优点：能够抓住一种土产，集中产销有关力量，摸透产销情况，找出问题的关键，订出具体解决的办法。而综合性交流会的范围广、时间短，只能满足一时的购销要求，很多问题来不及研究解决。这种专业交流会的作用有如下几点：
    （一）合理调整土产价格，扩大土产的销路。价格的调整，必须考虑全面的产销情况，才能避免主观、盲目和无原则地压低价格。这些问题只有通过专业会议才能解决。如省召开的红糖专业会议，研究了红糖在全国范围以内产销情况的变化，参照历史价格、生产成本、市场情况三方面来核算价格，解决销路问题。一九五二年浙江红糖产量五十四万担，比一九五○年增加了二倍多。而广东红糖增加百分之五十，品质好价格也低。广东提庄青（红糖）运上海，商业成本售价每担二十四万元，而浙江红糖运上海，商业成本售价每担达二十七万元。广东顺德青（红糖）运上海出售有毛利百分之十至二十，而浙江的义乌青（红糖）按当时产地收购牌价，运到上海还要亏本。因此，市场缩小，私商不愿贩运。另一方面，产地市价已低于牌价百分之十七。糖农反映：“不怕价低，就怕卖不掉”。其中主要原因是过去以官僚主义态度来掌握价格，没有精确的计算生产成本。这表现在：一、工资估计偏高，种一亩田要二十四到二十六个人工，每工工资高低不一，互助组六斤米到七斤米，单干户一般是八斤米，个别的十斤米。工资估计偏高，收购价格也就偏高。二、产糖率订得过低，如温州产糖率每亩定为五百斤，实际上最高产量八百斤，一般六百斤，个别的有到一千多斤的。三、加工工缴：每担糖的工缴费，温州六万九千四百二十元，义乌八万六千三百元，而广东只六万元。由于对红糖产量骤增、生产成本降低这一变化认识不足，加之思想上存有片面照顾农民利益的观点，忽视贩运商的利润，以致收购价格过高，使红糖大量积压。红糖专业会议摸清了以上产销情况的变化以后，就以调整价格为研究中心，详细计算生产成本、地区差价，按照“销地计算产地”，“少数（产量）参考多数”的原则，调整了工资，参照互助组工资统一为七千元一工，折合当地米价约为七斤至七斤半米，从而调低收购价百分之十五到十七，调低售价百分之九到十一；并号召降低生产成本，提高单位面积产量，提高品质来扩大与巩固销路。会后，在当时国营商业收购力量一度薄弱的情况下，也迅速地解决了红糖的滞销问题。
    （二）由于集中产销双方代表，着重地研究一种土产的问题，所以能够把推销问题与生产问题结合起来解决。譬如省召开的土纸、竹浆会议，成交了一百五十亿元的土纸，解决了部分土纸的销路问题，预付订金三十九亿元，支持了纸农生产；又结合研究了一九五三年的土纸和竹浆生产方向，决定土纸中文化纸、卫生纸维持原来生产水平，迷信纸逐步减产。同时要提高土纸品质，适当降低过高的工资。竹浆的问题主要是含砂太多损坏机器，一般成浆率仅百分之七十。会议上研究出提高品质的关键是：一、削料须嫩。二、石灰用量保持百分之十；料糖切忌泥砂混入，同一等级颜色须一致。三、今后生产方针是奖励甲级，维持乙级，逐步减少丙级，丁级坚决不产。
    （三）使一时的交流和经常性的商业活动的组织与领导结合起来。由于研究了生产、推销、价格、运输、资金等问题，一方面使会议上的交流业务顺利展开；另一方面在会后配合各方面力量，将会议中所研究的各项办法贯彻执行，因而促成商品的供求关系趋向正常，形成了交流会与经常商业活动相结合，并加强了对交流会与经常商业活动的组织领导。譬如，红糖专业会议的效果，主要是经过会后贯彻调整价格来实现的。余姚的竹器，会上成交一百四十笔，期货合同从一月订到六月，合同的付款、价格、规格、运输等问题，都必须在此期间经常检查。由此可见，专业性交流会不可能开了会就算数，许多问题要放在会后去贯彻实现。这样，就使一时的交流会议与经常性的商业组织领导结合起来。
    （四）组织专业交流会，产销二地代表面对面地研究问题，大家都努力开辟新旧商业关系，并在这个基础上进行交易活动，这样能够深入细致的解决某些大宗土产的销路问题，从而牵动整个市场转为活跃。宁波的春笋，去年由国营公司、合作社包收，销路没有打开。今年通过专业会议，上海七家行商驻奉化收购，销路打开，市场畅旺，直接解决了农民生产及生活问题。据奉化城西岙村的典型调查，全村一百八十户六百八十七人，推销春笋占总产量百分之七十五，买进手车十四辆，牛十三只，小猪六十只，五百万元的犁耙等农具、肥料，粮食十余石，还买了许多工业用品，并在银行储存了一千万元。该村二十辆手拉车，平均收入在五十万元以上。农民生活问题基本得到解决。
