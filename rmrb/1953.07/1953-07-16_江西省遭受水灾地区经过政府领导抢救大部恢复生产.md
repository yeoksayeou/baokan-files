Jiangxi Province experienced continuous heavy rain from May 10th to June 10th, leading to mountain torrents and rapid rises in the water levels of rivers such as the Fu River, Gan River, and Xin River. Some areas of counties and cities along the rivers suffered from varying degrees of flooding, with Nanchang, Ji'an, and Ganzhou prefectures being the most severely affected.

As early as the beginning of April, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government issued instructions to strengthen flood prevention and rescue work. In early May, the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters organized seven inspection teams to go to eleven counties, including Nanchang, Qingjiang, Yugan, Poyang, and Linchuan, to focus on inspecting dikes, embankments, and flood prevention preparations. Thanks to these preparations, when the dikes broke due to the continuous rain in late May, the masses in various places were able to enter the dangerous work areas in a timely and organized manner. When the river water began to rise, the deputy commissioner of Fuzhou Prefecture, the county heads of Nanchang, Xingan, Linchuan, and other counties, and responsible comrades of the county Party committees personally went to the dikes to lead the masses in protection and rescue efforts, thus significantly reducing the damage caused by this flood.

After the unavoidable flood damage occurred in Nanchang, Ji'an, and other areas of Jiangxi, the Nanchang and Ji'an Prefectural Party Committees and administrative offices, along with responsible cadres from various counties, led large numbers of personnel to the disaster areas to assist the local masses in flood control and dike repairs. The Provincial People's Government and the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee also formed a joint condolence delegation, led by Zhu Kaiquan, Director of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department, and the Deputy Commissioner of Nanchang Prefecture, coordinating with cadres dispatched by the Nanchang, Ganzhou, and Jiujiang prefectures to visit disaster-stricken counties such as Pingxiang, Xinyu, Fenyi, Qingjiang, Yongxiu, Xiushui, Anyuan, and Xinfeng. They distributed large amounts of emergency relief funds and various grain and loan provisions to solve the food and shelter problems of the affected people. At the same time, they led the masses in drainage, seedling support, rice washing, stone removal, replanting, seedling transfer, fertilizer application, and water conservancy restoration work. During the rescue process, the Provincial People's Government urgently instructed governments at all levels in the disaster areas to suspend all work unrelated to disaster relief, accurately assess the disaster situation, and make every effort to rescue the victims. It also issued 4 billion yuan in emergency relief funds allocated by the central government to the province and 650 sets of cotton clothing to the severely affected area of Pingxiang. The Provincial Department of Finance also allocated 500 million yuan in relief funds and 430,000 catties of public field rent grain to Nanchang Prefecture. The Provincial People's Bank also increased loans by 880 million yuan to help the affected people solve their living and production difficulties. Through the above measures, the disaster-stricken people in various places actively launched a campaign to control floods, repair dikes, and restore production. Production in the disaster areas has now recovered, and generally, they have entered the weeding stage. More than 70% of the small-scale water conservancy facilities that were destroyed have been restored. (Xu Lizhi)

    江西省遭受水灾地区经过政府领导抢救大部恢复生产
    江西省自五月十日至六月十日霪雨连绵，山洪暴发，抚河、赣江、信水等河水位先后急遽上涨，沿河两岸各县、市的部分地区遭受了轻重不同的水灾。其中以南昌、吉安、赣州三专区受害较重。
    早在四月上旬，江西省人民政府就发出了加强防汛抢险工作的指示，五月初，省防汛指挥部又组织了七个检查组，分别到南昌、清江、余干、鄱阳、临川等十一县，重点检查堤圩及防汛准备工作。经过这些准备工作，在五月下旬霪雨溃堤时，各地群众便保证了及时地有组织地进入了险工阵地；当河水开始上涨时，抚州专署副专员，南昌、新淦、临川等县县长和中共县委负责同志，都亲自上堤领导群众防护抢险，因此，相当地减少了这次洪水的灾害。
    江西南昌、吉安等地区遭到暂时不能避免的洪水灾害后，中共南昌、吉安地委和专署以及各县负责干部都带领大批人员赶到灾区，协助当地群众抢险堵口。省人民政府和中共江西省委并组成联合慰问团，由省政府民政厅朱开铨厅长及南昌专署副专员率领，配合南昌、赣州、九江三专署派出的干部，分别到萍乡、新喻、分宜、清江、永修、修水、安远、信丰等县慰问灾民，发放大批急救款及各种贷粮、贷款，解决灾民的食宿问题；同时领导群众进行排水、扶苗、洗秧、挑除沙石、改种、调剂秧苗、补肥和恢复水利等工作。在抢救过程中，省人民政府曾紧急指示灾区各级政府停止一切与救灾无关的工作，确实掌握灾情，全力抢救；并先后发出中央拨给该省水灾急赈款四十亿元，及发给萍乡重灾区的棉衣六百五十套。省财政厅亦拨给南昌专区救济款五亿元、公田租谷四十三万斤；省人民银行对灾民也增拨贷款八亿八千万元，帮助他们解决生活与生产的困难。经过以上措施，各地灾民积极地展开了抢险堵口、恢复生产的运动。现灾区生产已经恢复，一般地已进入耘禾阶段。被冲毁的小型水利一般已恢复了百分之七十以上。    （徐力之）
