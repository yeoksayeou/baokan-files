Xinhua News Agency report: Recovered Korean People's Army wounded and sick, having regained their health in rear hospitals in Korea, have been successively discharged, returning home to reunite with their families, and taking up different jobs according to their own aspirations, to serve the construction of the motherland.

　　Wu Wan’yi, who returned from Koje Island Prisoner of War Camp No. 13, has already started working in a factory. Jin Rongshan has also returned to the Pyongyang Municipal Theater to engage in creation, according to his own wishes. Jin Zongzhi, who participates in the work of the agency, not only works actively, but also often uses his spare time to enthusiastically read newspapers and books, so as to quickly improve his professional level. He often said to people: "I have regained happiness. I must study enthusiastically and work hard to repay the Labor Party, the Republic government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung who have given me this happiness."

　　Lu Changhua, a wounded soldier who returned from the US military prisoner of war camp on Koje Island, lived in the enemy's prisoner of war camp for more than two years, suffered abuse, and was covered in wounds. But in just over two months after returning to the embrace of the motherland, his wounds were completely healed. He has returned to his hometown, Qilin Erli, Pyongyang City, and reunited with his family, and actively participated in the work of the local residents' People's Class. He said: "In order to restore the homeland destroyed by the enemy and participate in the construction of the motherland, I will contribute everything I have left from this disaster."

　　Jin Dewan, who recently recovered and was discharged from the hospital, has returned to Pyongyang and reunited with his mother, sister, and others. After learning that the Li office had been taking care of and helping his family, he made a special trip to the Li office to express his gratitude.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The returned sick and wounded prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army, who have completely recovered their health after treatment in rear hospitals, are embarking on the road to returning home, filled with the joy of family reunion and confidence in building the motherland. They were warmly welcomed and cared for by the people along the way.

　　Zhao Yuanshan, Zhang Jiyan and more than a dozen other returned sick and wounded prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army have completely recovered their health and happily walked out of the rear hospital. On their way back to their hometowns, they were warmly welcomed and kindly cared for by the people of the motherland. When they passed by a certain village, An Jin-yu, the chairman of the Democratic Women's League of that village, immediately led the women of the whole village to vacate clean rooms for them to rest. Many people brought vegetables and meat from their homes to comfort them; others brought them various newly arrived books and newspapers.

　　At the earnest request of the people, Zhao Yuanshan and others lived happily in this village for two days. Before leaving, the village also held a farewell party for them. They were so moved by the warm care of the people of the motherland that they did not know what to do. They repeatedly stated: From the first day we returned to the embrace of the motherland, we have received the deep care of the Labor Party, the Republic government, and the compatriots of the motherland. The rear hospitals have healed our increasingly serious illnesses and injuries in the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps, enabling us to quickly regain our health and embark on the road to rebuilding a new life. We must devote all our energy to the cause of the production front and strive for the greatest results.

　　When they left the village, the people in the village sent them out of the village for a long distance before saying goodbye.

    【新华社讯】在朝鲜后方医院中恢复了健康的被遣返的朝鲜人民军病伤员已陆续出院，还乡与家人重聚，并按照各人的志愿，走上不同的工作岗位，为祖国的建设服务。
    从巨济岛第十三号战俘营回来的吴万益已经开始在工厂里工作，金容善也已按着自己的志愿回到平壤市立剧场从事创作。参加机关工作的金宗植不但积极工作，还经常利用工作的余暇，热心阅读报刊书籍，以便迅速提高自己的业务水平。他常对人说：“我已经重新得到了幸福，我一定要热心学习，努力工作，来报答使我得到这种幸福的劳动党、共和国政府和金日成元帅。”
    从巨济岛美军战俘营回来的伤员卢昌华，在敌人战俘营里住了两年多，受尽了虐待，遍身是伤。但他在回到祖国怀抱后两个多月，伤就完全治好了。他已经回到自己的家乡平壤市箕林二里和家人重聚，并积极参加了当地居民组织人民班的工作。他说：“为了恢复被敌人破坏了的家乡和参加祖国的建设，我将把我劫后余生的一切贡献出来。”
    最近痊愈出院的金德万已经回到平壤市和母亲、妹妹等团聚。他知道了里事务所对他的家属曾一直给予照顾和帮助的事实后，特地到里事务所表示感谢。
    【新华社平壤讯】经过后方医院治疗而完全恢复健康的被遣返的朝鲜人民军病伤战俘，满怀着骨肉团聚的喜悦和建设祖国的信心，陆续走上重返家园的路途。他们沿途受到人们的热情欢迎和照顾。
    被遣返的朝鲜人民军病伤战俘赵元善和张基彦等十几个人已完全恢复了健康，愉快地走出了后方医院。他们在还乡途中，一路上受着祖国人民的热烈欢迎和亲切照顾。当他们路过某村的时候，那个村子的民主妇女同盟委员长安锦玉马上率领全村妇女为他们腾出干净房间，请他们休息。好多人都从自己家里送来菜和肉来慰问他们；也有人给他们送来各种新到的书报刊物。
    在人们恳切的挽留下，赵元善等在这个村子愉快地住了两天，临走前，村子里还为他们开了欢送会。他们在祖国人民的热情关怀下感动得不知道怎样才好。他们再三地表示：我们从回到祖国怀抱的第一天起，便受到劳动党、共和国政府和祖国同胞的深切关怀，后方医院为我们医治好了在敌人俘虏营里那种越来越严重的病伤，使我们能迅速恢复健康，踏上重新建立新生活的道路。我们一定要把全部精力投在生产战线的事业上，争取最大的成果。
    当他们离开这个村子的时候，村子里的人一直送他们出村子很远的地方以后才和他们告别。
