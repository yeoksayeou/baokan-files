    Some Opinions on Wheat Disease Prevention and Control

    Letter from the Plant Protection Division's Disease Section of the Central Ministry of Agriculture: Currently, spring wheat is beginning to head. In order to do a good job in preventing and controlling wheat diseases, increase the yield of spring wheat next year, and lay a good foundation for future prevention and control work, the following opinions are put forward for research and reference in various regions:
    (1) Field inspections of spring wheat should be carried out in a planned and focused manner, especially in areas where wheat smut and wheat nematode disease are severely occurring and where prevention and control work has already been launched. To provide practical education for the masses, organize nearby people to visit during inspections in a planned way.
    (2) In the past, many areas failed to earnestly mobilize the masses to carry out ear selection. In the future, leadership in this work should be strengthened. In areas where there is a habit of seed replacement, farmers can be encouraged to exchange disease-free wheat seeds with each other.
    (3) Although some areas have carried out the work of removing diseased plants in the past, the expected results have not been achieved because the treatment after removing diseased plants was not thorough enough. In the future, after diseased plants are removed, they must be thoroughly treated—burned or buried deeply in pits—to prevent the spread of pathogens.

### 对麦病防治工作的几点意见

    对麦病防治工作的几点意见
    中央农业部植物保护司病害科来信：目前春麦开始抽穗，为了作好麦病防治工作，使明年春麦获得增产，并给今后防治工作打下良好的基础，特提出以下意见供各地研究参考：
    （一）要对春麦有计划、有重点地进行田间检查，特别是在麦类黑穗病和小麦线虫病严重发生及已展开防治工作的地区应更进一步了解病害的发生情况与防治效果。为了使群众得到实地教育，检查时要有计划地组织附近群众参观。
    （二）过去不少地区未能认真发动群众进行穗选，今后应加强对这一工作的领导。在有换种习惯的地区，可提倡农户间串换无病麦种。
    （三）过去有些地区虽已开展拔除病株工作，但因拔除病株后处理不够彻底，因此不能收到预期的效果。今后病株拔除后要彻底处理——烧毁或掘坑深埋，以防止病菌的传染。
