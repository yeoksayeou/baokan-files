    East China Level-One Organs: Six organs, namely the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Direct Organs, the East China Administrative Council, the East China Financial and Economic Committee, the East China Cultural and Educational Committee, the East China Public Security Bureau, and the Shanghai Railway Administration, have successively established six amateur political schools since April.
    The six amateur political schools have a total of 3,730 formal students and 213 auditing students. After reviewing the "Political Common Knowledge Reader" learned last year, each school proceeded to study "Common Knowledge of Economic Construction."
    In terms of teaching, each school initially emphasized the selection and appointment of teachers. The teachers hired by the amateur political schools of the East China Administrative Council and the Direct Organs of the East China Bureau were cadres at or above the level of section or office chiefs with a certain level of theoretical understanding. Liu Shunyuan, Deputy Secretary-General of the East China Administrative Council, personally led the teacher group of the Administrative Council's amateur political school and organized teachers to prepare lessons. Teachers generally prepared lessons conscientiously and were enthusiastic about teaching. For example, Jin Xuecheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Administrative Council, repeatedly listened to other people's lectures and read the broadcast script of the first chapter of the People's Broadcasting Station's "Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" to draw experience for good lesson preparation. After writing his own lecture outline, he submitted it to the teacher group meeting for repeated research and revision. Therefore, the students generally responded very well after he gave the first lesson. When the East China Bureau's amateur political school taught the first lesson of "Common Knowledge of Economic Construction," the teaching failed to meet the students' requirements. The Academic Affairs Office immediately conducted research and submitted the students' feedback to the teachers for reference. The teachers also went deep into the groups to understand the students' requirements and ideological situation, and carefully prepared their lessons. As a result, subsequent lectures achieved good results, and most students were in high spirits for learning.
    In terms of teaching system, each school held an entrance examination at the beginning of the semester. Those who passed the exam were considered formal students, and those who failed but were not far behind in their level were considered auditors. In terms of class and group composition, the amateur political schools of the East China Bureau, the Administrative Council, and the Cultural and Educational Committee combined Party and Youth League organizations and administrative units to form classes and groups, so that the learning organization and the Party and Youth League organizations were closely integrated. In order to strengthen teaching work, each school generally set up one to three full-time cadres. Due to the strict implementation of the classroom roll call and leave-of-absence system, the student absenteeism rate has been greatly reduced, generally accounting for only 6% of the total number of students (mostly due to official business or illness). Students who were absent were able to comply with the regulations of asking for leave in advance and making up lessons afterwards; there were very few cases of being late for class.
    At present, there are still some shortcomings in teaching and system implementation in various schools. First of all, although each school has formulated a complete teaching plan, it has not formulated specific plans for each chapter. Therefore, it is not clear what problems should be solved in each chapter, which makes learning somewhat blind. Secondly, the school's help to teachers in preparing lessons is not enough, and teachers do not fully understand the students' ideological situation, which often weakens the teaching effect. In particular, individual schools, although they have the name of a school, still adopt the method of large classes without a fixed system. These shortcomings should be overcome in the future.

### 华东一级机关举办业余政治学校

    华东一级机关举办业余政治学校
    华东一级机关：中共中央华东局直属机关、华东行政委员会、华东财经委员会、华东文教委员会、华东公安局、上海铁路管理局六个机关，从四月份起先后举办了六个业余政治学校。
    六个机关业余政治学校共有正式学员三千七百三十人，旁听学员二百一十三人。各校在复习了去年学习的“政治常识读本”之后，接着学习“经济建设常识”。
    在教课方面，各校一开始都重视教员的选聘工作，华东行政委员会和华东局直属机关业余政治学校聘请的教员都是具有一定理论修养的科、处长级以上干部。华东行政委员会刘顺元副秘书长亲自领导行政委员会业余政治学校教员小组工作，组织教员备课。教员一般都能认真备课，热心教学。例如行政委员会金学成副秘书长，为了很好的备课，曾多次地听取别人的讲课，阅读人民广播电台“经济建设常识”第一章的广播稿，从中吸取经验，并在自己写出讲课提纲后，交到教员小组会反复地研究修改，因此，他在讲第一课后学员普遍反映很好。华东局机关业余政治学校，在讲“经济建设常识”第一课时，教课未能满足学员要求。教务处立即进行了研究，将学员的反映提交教员作参考。教员并深入小组了解学员的要求和思想情况，用心准备功课；因而使以后的讲课获得良好效果，绝大部分学员的学习情绪都很高。
    在教学制度方面，各校在开学时都举行了入学考试。考试及格的作为正式学员，不及格而程度相差不远者作为旁听生。在编班编组方面，华东局、行政委员会、文委等的业余政治学校都结合党、团组织和行政单位进行编制，使学习组织和党、团组织密切地结合起来。为加强教学工作，各个学校一般都设置了一至三个专职干部。由于严格执行了课堂点名及请假制度，学员缺课率大为减少，一般的只占学员总数的百分之六（大多数是因公外出或者生病），缺课的学员都能做到事先请假事后补课的规定；上课时很少有迟到的现象。
    各校目前在教学和执行制度方面还存在着一些缺点。首先，各校虽订有整个的教学计划，但没有制订每章具体计划，因而对每章要解决那些问题心中无数，使学习存在着一些盲目性。其次，学校方面对教员备课工作帮助还不够，教员没有充分了解学员的思想情况，往往削弱了教学效果。特别是个别学校，虽有学校之名，但仍然采用没有一定制度的上大课的方式。这些缺点，今后应加以克服。
