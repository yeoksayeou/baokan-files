Readers Continue to Reflect on Inability to Subscribe to Newspapers

    Editor's note: We continue to receive letters from readers reflecting the difficulty of subscribing to newspapers in their local areas. We are publishing a selection of these letters below (we have already arranged for supplementary subscriptions of this newspaper for those who requested it). We hope the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will continue to pay attention to this matter.
    (I)
    A letter from the Propaganda Section of the Political Department of the Baoji-Lanzhou Engineering Office of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways: Our office was newly established in May of this year. At that time, the higher authorities had not yet allocated funds for propaganda and education, so we had to pay for two copies of the People's Daily out of our own pockets. On May 30th, the higher authorities allocated the funds for propaganda and education, and we immediately went to the Tianshui Post Office to subscribe to the People's Daily for July. Unexpectedly, the comrade at the post office said: "Newspaper subscriptions are quarterly. The deadline has passed, so we can't subscribe now." We pleaded for a long time, but the post office ignored us, and we had to return dejectedly.
    Our Propaganda Section is responsible for carrying out propaganda and education work for more than 10,000 road construction workers, and the People's Daily is of great help to our work. We did not intentionally fail to comply with the post office's regulations, but rather because our organization was newly established, and cadres were frequently transferred. Having not read newspapers for a long time, we were unaware that there were such regulations for newspaper subscriptions.
    In our opinion, the people's newspapers should be distributed according to the needs of the people. Newspaper distribution agencies should not overemphasize regulations and refuse to help. On the contrary, they have a responsibility, to the extent possible, to try to help these units obtain supplementary subscriptions to newspapers. Otherwise, it will weaken the connection between newspapers and the masses of people.
    (II)
    A letter from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: Our unit originally subscribed to seven copies of the People's Daily. In April of this year, a new unit was added to our department, requiring an additional subscription to one copy of the People's Daily. We repeatedly contacted the Huolu Post Office in Hebei Province (which is closer to us), but for more than a month now, we have not been able to subscribe to the newspaper.
    In April, we sent a special person to the Huolu Post Office to request an additional subscription to one copy of the newspaper. Their reply was: "Newspapers must now be subscribed to quarterly. It is not possible to subscribe to newspapers for April. Wait until the next quarter!" In early May, we sent someone to contact the bureau again. A comrade at the bureau said: "You have already subscribed to seven copies of the newspaper, and we can't increase it any further. According to the number of newspapers allocated to Huolu, it is already 'difficult' enough not to reduce your number. It is impossible to subscribe to more newspapers!" Therefore, until now, the problem of our request to subscribe to an additional copy of the newspaper has not been resolved.
    (III)
    A letter from Pan Chuanshou of Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province: Since I subscribed to the People's Daily as a learning resource in December of last year, I have always paid for the newspaper subscription before the 20th of the previous month, in compliance with the regulations. Who would have thought that from May 1st, my newspaper subscription would suddenly be suspended. After repeated inquiries, I only received the newspapers for May 5th and 6th on May 10th. I asked the mail carrier to request that the newspapers for May 1st to 4th be reissued. The next day, he came and said that the newspapers for May 5th and 6th were sent by mistake, and my subscription had been missed. He immediately took back the newspapers for those two days and refunded my newspaper fee of 18,000 yuan. I repeatedly asked him to find a way to subscribe to the newspaper, but he always said that there was no way.
    (IV)
    A letter from Zhang Shanzhou of the Lubei Meteorological Station in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: On March 5th, we received instructions from higher authorities that starting in the second quarter, our organization would subscribe to newspapers from the local post office. We immediately pre-ordered one copy of the People's Daily and one copy of the Eastern Edition of the Inner Mongolia Daily from the Lubei Post Office. However, the Lubei Post Office said: The subscription letter for the second quarter newspapers was sent to the newspaper office on March 4th, so it is no longer possible to subscribe. Thus, we will not be able to see the newspapers in the second quarter. We don't understand why we can't make a supplementary subscription. We asked the post office several times, and they replied: We can only subscribe to the third quarter, and we will only start seeing the newspapers in July. In addition, we also pre-ordered periodicals such as New Observer, Current Affairs Handbook, China Youth, People's Literature, and Popular Science from the Lubei Post Office, but the Lubei Post Office only subscribed to China Youth, Current Affairs Handbook, and New Observer, and would not subscribe to the others. They said that subscribing to these magazines was not within their scope of business. I think their work attitude is wrong.

### 读者继续反映订不到报纸

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者继续反映订不到报纸
    编者按：我们继续收到不少读者来信，反映在当地订不到报纸等情况。兹将这些来信继续选择一部分摘要发表于后（其中有要求补订本报的，我们已代为补订），希望邮电部继续予以注意。
    （一）
    铁道部第一工程局宝兰工程处政治处宣教科来信：我们机关在今年五月新成立，当时上级尚未拨下宣教费，我们只得由私人掏钱订了两份人民日报。五月三十日上级拨下宣教费，我们立即去天水邮局订七月份的人民日报。不料邮局的同志说：“订报要按季度订，现在已经过期，不能订了。”我们要求了半天，邮局置之不理，我们只得垂头丧气地回来。
    我们宣教科要对一万多修路职工进行宣传教育工作，人民日报对我们工作帮助很大。我们并不是有意不遵守邮局制度，而是机构新成立，干部来回调动，久未看报，实在不晓得订报有这样的规定。
    在我们看来，人民的报纸应该按照人民的需要而发行。报纸发行机构不应过分强调制度而推开不理，相反的，在可能的条件下还有责任尽量设法使这些单位补订到报纸。否则，就会削弱报纸和人民群众的联系。
    （二）
    中国人民解放军某部来信：我部原订人民日报七份。今年四月，我部增加一个新单位，须增订人民日报一份。我们再三向河北省获鹿邮局（我们离该邮局较近）联系，但至今一个多月，还未订到报纸。
    四月间，我们派专人去获鹿邮局，要求增订一份报纸。他们的答复是：“现在报纸要按季订阅，四月份的报纸是不能订阅了，等以后订下一季的吧！”五月初，我们又派人去该局联系。该局一位同志说：“你们已订了七份报，不能再增加了。按照获鹿分配到的报纸数目，不给你们减少就很‘勉强’啦，增订报纸是不行啦！”因此，直至现在，我们要求增订一份报纸的问题仍未解决。
    （三）
    浙江省永康县潘传授来信：本人自去年十二月份起订人民日报为学习资料后，迄今五月，一向是遵章在前月二十日以前付款订报。谁料从五月一日起，我所订的报纸突然中止。经过再三追查，在五月十日才收到五月五日和六日两天的报纸。我请邮递员向上级要求补发五月一日至四日的报，第二天他来时竟说，那五日、六日两天报纸发错了，我的报已漏了。他当即取回那两天的报纸，并退回我报费一万八千元。我再三要求设法订报，但他总是说已经没有办法。
    （四）
    内蒙古自治区鲁北气象台张善周来信：三月五日，我们得到上级指示，第二季度开始由本机关向当地邮局订阅报纸。我们当时就向鲁北邮局预订人民日报一份及内蒙古日报东部版一份，但鲁北邮局说：第二季度报纸已在三月四日向报社发出预订信，故不能再订了。这样我们在第二季度就不能看到报了。我们不明白为什么不能补订，向邮局问过几次，他们回答是：只能订第三季度的，七月份才能开始看到报纸。另外，我们还曾向鲁北邮局预订新观察、时事手册、中国青年、人民文学、科学大众等期刊，但鲁北邮局只给订了中国青年、时事手册、新观察，其他的不给订。他们说：收订这些杂志不在他们的业务范围之内。我觉得他们这种工作态度是不对的。
