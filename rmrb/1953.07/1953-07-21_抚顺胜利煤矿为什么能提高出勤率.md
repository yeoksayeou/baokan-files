Why Fushun Shengli Coal Mine Can Improve Attendance Rate
　　Wang Jiyao

　　Fushun Shengli Coal Mine in Northeast China frequently reaches or exceeds the national attendance rate standard, making it a unit with good labor discipline in the coal mine system. Because the working conditions for coal miners working underground are poor, the state stipulates an attendance rate of 92%. However, many coal mining teams in the mine can often maintain an attendance rate of over 94%. The mine has adopted the following measures to ensure attendance:

　　1. When formulating monthly production plans, coal miners not only develop plans for output, quality, and safety measures, but also create attendance plans for workers. When workers discuss the attendance plan, they first explain whether they have any personal matters that require leave during the month. If so, after everyone's discussion, if it is deemed that others can help solve the problem, the workers on the night shift will help solve it during the day so that the worker does not miss work. If a worker's reason for requesting leave is insufficient or inappropriate, everyone will offer criticism. At the weekly production meeting, everyone checks the implementation of the attendance plan, and the team leader or coal mining captain is criticized for approving unreasonable leave.

　　2. Use red flag competitions to improve attendance rate. In the competition, workers who reach the specified attendance rate receive full marks; otherwise, points are deducted. For example, during the Lunar New Year, when workers were vying to go home, the entire mine launched a mobile red flag competition to ensure attendance. Those who were granted leave were also able to return on time. Some workers said, "If we didn't launch the competition, after working hard all year round, I would have to take two days off!" Sometimes, when the conditions of the coal mining face are poor and production is difficult, the trade union launches a red flag grabbing campaign, with the coal mining team as the unit.

　　3. Establish role models, commend advanced individuals, and hold discussion meetings and report meetings to educate workers. The mine's administration and trade union have invited veteran workers with good attendance to give reports. Wang Maoxian is a 57-year-old worker who has been mining coal for 32 years and enjoys retirement benefits, but he still goes down the pit to work every day. Since liberation, he has not been absent from work for a single day, and he strictly adheres to operating procedures, labor discipline, and various regulations. At the meeting, he talked about the reasons for not being absent from work, and the workers who had been absent from work expressed their desire to learn from him. On another occasion, ten veteran workers who were not absent from work were convened for a discussion meeting, and they were asked to talk about why they were not absent from work. Workers who were absent from work were invited to attend as observers. After listening to the veterans, one young worker burst into tears and said, "If the veteran workers can do this, I will never be absent from work again."

　　4. Grasp the patterns of absenteeism, conduct education in advance, and prevent absenteeism. Experience has shown that workers are most likely to be absent from work during the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival each year, especially rural workers who live close to the mine. Secondly, it is easy to be absent from work on the second day of rotation breaks. Some workers go home, and some go to Shenyang to play with friends, and they cannot make it back the next day, so they are absent from work. Furthermore, it is easy to be absent from work after payday. The mine conducts education based on these situations. Before rotation breaks, the squad leader will remind everyone, and the attendance rate will improve. Wages are paid to all miners on the day before the rest day each month. Workers are very satisfied to receive their wages a few days early, as they have time to buy things and avoid absenteeism.

　　5. Some workers, although agreeing to the attendance plan, still have cases of absenteeism and lack of attendance. The mine organizes visiting teams of three or four propagandists to visit the homes of workers with poor attendance. If they are sick, they are given condolences and assistance. If they are absent from work without a valid reason, they and their families are persuaded and educated. For example, coal miner Wang Chunsheng missed one day of work due to getting married and repairing his house. When the visiting team arrived at his house, he said, "Can't I miss two days of work for my wedding? I still have to miss one day of work to build the kang [heated brick bed]." The comrades of the visiting team said, "You go to work tomorrow, and we will take care of building the kang for you; otherwise, the production task will not be completed." When he got off work the next day and went home, he was very happy to see that the night shift workers had built his kang quickly and well. The visiting team played a significant role in ensuring attendance and ensuring the completion of production tasks.

　　6. Care for the workers' difficulties and improve the workers' attendance rate. The mine's safety work has been done well, and accidents have gradually decreased in recent years. The mine also pays attention to improving workers' labor protection and working conditions. They check the workers' used labor supplies (such as raincoats, boots, etc.) every day and repair leaks and damage, which the workers are very satisfied with. In addition, a worker's canteen has been set up underground so that workers do not eat cold food, which not only prevents them from being hungry, but also enhances their physical strength and reduces fatigue, thereby improving labor efficiency. The mine has also manufactured a special hot water car so that workers can get enough hot water to drink underground. Because there are fewer accidents and the workers' morale is stable, there are fewer instances of absenteeism.

　　7. The mine gives appropriate administrative punishments to individual workers who repeatedly fail to reform and have serious errors, in order to educate everyone. For example, one worker only worked twenty workdays in three months. This not only affected the completion of the production task, but also affected the implementation of the mixed piece-rate wage system and the achievement of quotas, and tarnished the collective honor. After being criticized at the general meeting, he still did not change. The administration expelled him, and the workers said that the punishment was appropriate.

    抚顺胜利煤矿为什么能提高出勤率
    王继尧
    东北抚顺胜利煤矿经常达到或超过国家规定的出勤率标准，是煤矿系统中遵守劳动纪律较好的一个单位。由于煤矿坑下作业的采煤工人劳动条件不好，国家规定出勤率为百分之九十二。但是该矿许多采煤小组经常能保持出勤率在百分之九十四以上。该矿是采取了如下一些办法来保证出勤率的：
    一、采煤工人在订每月生产计划时，除制订产量、质量和保安措施外，还订出工人的出勤计划。工人在讨论出勤计划时首先说明自己在本月内有没有私事需要请假，如有，经大家讨论，认为可以让别人帮助解决时，即由上夜班的工人在白天帮助解决，使他不误工。有的工人请假的理由不充分或不正当，大家就提出批评。在每周的生产会议上大家来检查出勤计划执行情况，小组长或采煤队长准假不合理的，就对他提出批评。
    二、用红旗竞赛提高出勤率。在竞赛中，工人出勤率达到规定的即得满分，否则扣分。如在过旧历年时，工人纷纷要求回家，全矿便发动了流动红旗竞赛，保证出勤。被准假的人也都能按时回来；有的工人说：“如不发动竞赛，忙一年到头，我怎么也得休两天工！”有时遇到采煤工作面的条件不好，生产困难时，工会便又以采煤小组为单位，发动抢红旗运动。
    三、树立典型，表扬先进人物，召开座谈会、报告会，教育工人。该矿行政和工会曾请出勤好的老工人做报告。王茂先是五十七岁的老工人，采煤三十二年，已享受养老金待遇，但他每天仍然下坑工作，解放后没有旷过一天工，而且很遵守操作规程、劳动纪律和各种制度。他在会上讲了他不旷工的原因，曾经旷工的工人都表示向他学习。还有一次召集了十个不旷工的老工人开座谈会，请他们讲为什么不旷工，并请旷工的工人列席，有一个青年工人听了之后痛哭流涕地说：“老工人能这样，我以后再不旷工了。”
    四、抓住旷工的规律，事先进行教育，防止旷工。根据经验证明，工人最容易旷工的时间是每年的端午节和中秋节，特别是离矿近的农村工人旷工的最多。其次是轮休的第二天容易旷工，有的工人回家，有的几个人到沈阳去玩，第二天赶不回来便旷工了。再就是发薪以后容易旷工。该矿便根据这些情况进行教育。轮休前班长组长关照一声，出勤率情况便好一些。每月工薪在全矿工人休息的前一天发，工人早几天领薪都很满意，又有时间买东西，又能不旷工。
    五、有的工人虽同意了出勤计划，但还是有旷工和欠勤的情况，该矿便由宣传员组成三、四个人的拜访小组，到欠勤工人家去访问，如果是病了，便进行慰问和帮助，如果是无故旷工便向本人和其家属进行说服教育。如采煤工人王春生结婚修理房子误了一天工，拜访小组到了他家，他说：“我结婚还不能欠两个工？明天我盘炕还得欠一个工。”拜访小组的同志便说：“你明天上班，盘炕我们负责，不然生产任务完不成。”第二天他下班回家，看到夜班工人把炕给他盘的又快又好，很高兴。拜访小组对保证出勤率和保证完成生产任务起了很大作用。
    六、关心工人的疾苦，提高工人的出勤率。该矿的保安工作做得较好，几年来事故逐渐减少。该矿对改善工人的劳动保护和劳动条件也很注意。每天检查工人用过的劳动用品（如雨衣、靴子等），修补漏水、损坏的地方，工人都很满意。另外还在坑下设立了工人食堂，使工人不吃冷食，不仅挨不到饿，而且增强了体力，减少了疲劳，劳动效率因而提高。该矿并制造了一种特备的开水车，使工人能在坑下得到足够的开水喝。由于事故少，工人情绪稳定，旷工的现象也就少了。
    七、该矿对个别屡教不改、错误严重的工人，给予适当的行政处分，以教育大家。如有一个工人在三个月内只做了二十个工作日的工，这样不仅影响了生产任务的完成，对实行混合计件工资和达到定额也有影响，败坏了集体的荣誉，经过大会上的批评他仍然不改，行政方面就把他开除了，工人都说处理得对。
