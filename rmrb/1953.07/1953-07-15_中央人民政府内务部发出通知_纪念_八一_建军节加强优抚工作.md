    Central People's Government Ministry of Internal Affairs Issues Notice on Strengthening Support Work in Commemoration of "August 1st" Army Day
    (Not to be issued separately) The full text of the notice from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on strengthening support work in commemoration of the 26th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is as follows:
    I. As the 26th anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Army Day is approaching, in order to commemorate this great historical festival and further strengthen support work, the following notification is made:
    1. All levels of government, in addition to publicizing the significance of Army Day to cadres and the masses and carrying out education on "drinking water and thinking of the source" and preferential policies, should cooperate with the stationed troops to hold good "August 1st" commemorative meetings or army-civilian get-togethers, and慰问 (extend appreciation to) stationed troops, wounded and sick soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and write letters to慰问 (express appreciation to) the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    2. All localities should conduct a top-to-bottom inspection of support work. In rural areas, focusing on old revolutionary base areas and disaster areas with a large number of families of martyrs and soldiers, emphasis should be placed on combining patriotic production increases to check the organization and assistance of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in production and substitute cultivation, as well as the resettlement work for soldiers in their hometowns (including disabled, demobilized, and transferred soldiers), and earnestly do a good job in weeding, topdressing, flood prevention, drought prevention, and pest control to ensure increased production on their self-cultivated and substitute-cultivated land. In cities, emphasis should be placed on checking the production assistance for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and soldiers in their hometowns and the priority absorption of them into work, with机关 (government) units, organizations, and state-owned enterprises as units, and formulate future improvement methods. In addition to organizing forces and focusing on one county (district) to conduct in-depth household surveys of the lives, production, and in-kind subsidies of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, provinces (cities) should especially investigate the organization of production, job introductions, problem solving, and resettlement work for soldiers in their hometowns, and convene relevant personnel to discuss the problems found and formulate solutions as needed. In addition, under the principle of combining the general election without harming production, representative meetings of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and soldiers in their hometowns can be held at the county (city) level to solicit opinions widely and encourage their labor production. Townships can hold座谈会 (similar forums) of a similar nature.
    3. Localities should appropriately resolve the difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers through the in-kind subsidies for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the education subsidies for children of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. Those soldiers in their hometowns who have not been properly resettled or who have difficulties in production and life even after resettlement must be given appropriate solutions in accordance with the central government's repeated instructions and the joint notification of the Ministry and the Ministry of Finance; and they should be educated to focus on production and not blindly flock to the cities; those with a few skills should be helped to participate in appropriate work.
    4. Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Schools should focus on training the majority of students to the junior high school level before employment. The aim should be to spend two years running primary schools well, two years running junior high schools well, and those with the conditions to enter universities and specialized schools should apply for workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools after graduating from primary school. Provinces with more荣校 (honored school) students can set up classes or schools similar to workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools. In accordance with the above principles, all provinces should carry out rectification and summarize experience during the summer vacation on the existing basis, and prepare for the next semester's plan and various preparations.
    All localities are requested to study and formulate plans, organize implementation, and submit comprehensive reports on the above points.

    中央人民政府内务部发出通知
    纪念“八一”建军节加强优抚工作
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府内务部关于纪念“八一”建军节加强优抚工作的通知（不另行文）。全文如下：
    中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十六周年即将到来了，为了纪念这一具有历史意义的伟大节日，进一步加强优抚工作，特作如下通知：
    一、各级人民政府除向干部、群众宣传建军节的意义及进行“饮水思源”与优抚政策的教育外，应配合驻军开好“八一”纪念会，或军民联欢会，并慰问驻军，伤病员，革命残废军人，革命烈士、革命军人家属，和写信慰问中国人民志愿军。
    二、各地应从上至下检查一次优抚工作。在农村以烈军属多的老区、灾区为重点，着重结合爱国增产，检查组织与扶助革命烈士、军人家属生产和代耕，及对在乡军人（包括残废、复员、转业军人）的安置工作，切实做好锄草、追肥、防水、防旱、治虫，以保证其自耕和代耕田地的增产。在城市应着重以机关、团体和公营企业为单位，检查帮助革命烈士、军人家属和在乡军人的生产和优先吸收他们参加工作的情况，订出今后改进办法。省（市）除应组织力量并有重点地抓紧一个县（区）深入到户，调查革命烈士、军人家属生活、生产和实物补助等情况外，特别要调查对在乡军人的组织生产、介绍职业、解决困难与安置工作等情况，并视情况需要就所发现的问题召集有关人员进行讨论，订出解决办法。此外，在结合普选不妨害生产的原则下，可以县（市）为单位召开革命烈士、军人家属与在乡军人代表会，广泛征询意见，鼓励其劳动生产。乡可召开类似性质的座谈会。
    三、各地对革命烈士、军人家属的困难问题，在革命烈士、军人家属实物补助费和革命烈士、革命军人子女入学补助费中加以适当解决。对在乡军人未安置好或虽已安置而生产、生活有困难的，必须依照中央迭次指示及本部与财政部联合通知的规定，给予适当解决；并教育他们安心生产，不要盲目流入城市；对少数有技能的应帮助其参加适当工作。
    四、革命残废军人学校按多数学员培养至初中程度即行就业为主的方针，以二年办好小学，二年办好初中，部分具有升入大学、专科条件者在小学毕业后投考工农速成中学，荣校学员较多的省，可办类似工农速成中学的班次或学校。各省应根据上述原则，在现有的基础上，于暑假期间进行整顿与总结经验，做好下学期计划和各项准备。
    以上各点希各地研究拟定计划，组织进行，并综合上报。
        中央人民政府内务部    七月十日
