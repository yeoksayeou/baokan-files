Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: TASS Berlin Dispatch: According to Deutsche Nachrichten Agentur, the Mayor of Greater Berlin, Friedrich Ebert, received the agency's reporter and discussed the implementation of the resolutions adopted by the government of the German Democratic Republic on June 11th and 25th, 1953, by the Greater Berlin authorities.

According to the discussion, refugees returning to the democratic sector of Berlin and the German Democratic Republic have been rehoused and have obtained work according to their professions. Ebert cited many examples to illustrate that farmers and employers have regained their property—farms and businesses. Among the 1,134 applications for the return of enterprises, 517 have been approved.

So far, 303 households have applied for short-term loans from the Berlin Bank and savings banks, of which 254 have received loans. Among the 40 households applying for long-term loans to build private houses, 16 have received loans.

Ebert broadly outlined the various measures taken by the municipal authorities to improve sanitary facilities in local state-owned enterprises and related housing construction.

When discussing the production of consumer goods, Ebert said that in addition to the funds stipulated in the plan, another 86 million marks would be allocated for consumer goods production.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: TASS Ottawa, July 16th Dispatch: The "Citizen" published an editorial entitled "Using Food as a Political Weapon," condemning the US authorities' suggestion of using food "aid" as a means to win over the German Democratic Republic.

The "Citizen" pointed out that Washington's suggestion to supply food to the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany should be seen as a political means, regardless of whether the Soviet Union accepts it or not, the United States can carry out propaganda.

The "Citizen" compared the US tactics with the sincere and humane assistance of the Soviet Union to the flood victims in Western Europe. The newspaper said that, for example, last winter, Russia silently gave selfless financial assistance to flood victims in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom without any unnecessary propaganda.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: Deutsche Nachrichten Agentur, Frankfurt (West Germany), July 16th Dispatch: The "Socialist People's Newspaper" quoted a commentary by M. S. Handler, the "New York Times" correspondent in Berlin, regarding the so-called "food aid" from the United States to the German Democratic Republic. Handler said, "If the US government thinks that psychological warfare can help the import of American goods, such as macaroni, fruit juice, sugar, and chewing gum, etc., its psychological warfare will not succeed." He described this so-called "aid plan" as a "dirty political deal," and pointed out that the proposers of this plan first wanted to take advantage of the situation and secondly wanted to increase Adenauer's "hopes" in the upcoming elections.

    大柏林市当局积极采取措施改善人民生活
    加拿大“公民报”谴责美国以粮食作政治武器的宣传手段
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：据德意志通讯社消息，大柏林市长弗雷德里希·艾伯特接见该社记者，谈大柏林市当局对德意志民主共和国政府在一九五三年六月十一日和二十五日所采取的决议的执行情况。
    据谈，回到柏林民主区和德意志民主共和国的难民已重新得到房屋并根据他们所从事的行业获得了工作。艾伯特举出许多实例说明农民和雇主已重获他们的财产——田庄和企业。在一千一百三十四项请求归还企业的申请中，已有五百十七项申请获得批准。
    到目前为止，向柏林银行和储蓄银行申请短期贷款的有三百零三户，其中二百五十四户已得到贷款。申请长期贷款以建筑私人住宅的四十户中，有十六户已得到贷款。
    艾伯特概括地说明了市政当局所采取的改善当地国营企业的卫生设备和有关房屋建筑的各项措施。
    艾伯特在谈到关于消费品的生产时说，除了计划所规定的款项以外，还要拨出八千六百万马克为消费品生产之用。
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社渥太华十六日讯：“公民报”以“把粮食当作一种政治武器”为题发表社论，谴责美国当局建议以粮食“援助”德意志民主共和国的笼络人心的手段。
    “公民报”指出，华盛顿建议把食物供给德国苏占区，应该认为是一种政治手段，不管苏联接受与否，美国都可以进行宣传。
    “公民报”把美国的手段和苏联对西欧水灾灾民的诚恳、人道的援助加以比较。该报说，例如，去年冬天，俄国曾不声不响地给荷兰和英国的水灾受害者以无私的金钱上的援助，而未进行任何不必要的宣传。
    【新华社十八日讯】据德意志通讯社法兰克福（西德）十六日讯：“社会主义人民报”引了美国“纽约时报”驻柏林记者麦·斯·汉德勒关于美国对德意志民主共和国的所谓“食物援助”的一段评论。汉德勒说：“美国政府如果以为进行心理战就可以帮助美国货，如通心粉、果子汁、糖和口香糖等等的进口，那它的心理战是不会成功的。”他把这个所谓的“援助计划”形容做“肮脏的政治买卖”，并且指出，这个计划的提议者首先是想利用形势得到好处，其次是想增加阿登纳在未来选举中的“希望”。
