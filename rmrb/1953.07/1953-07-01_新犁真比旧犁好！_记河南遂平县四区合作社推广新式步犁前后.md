"The New Plow is Truly Better Than the Old Plow!"
— A Record of the Promotion of New-Style Walking Plows Before and After in the Fourth District Cooperative of Suiping County, Henan Province

"The new plow is truly better than the old plow!" The farmers of the Fourth District of Suiping County, Henan Province, often praise the cooperative for doing such a good deed for them. The district is a plain area, and the seven-inch walking plow is one of the agricultural tools urgently needed by the local farmers. From 1951 to after the wheat harvest last year, the cooperative in the district sold a total of 162 new-style walking plows, making it the district with the largest number of new-style walking plows sold in the entire county. The farmers in the district who purchased the new-style walking plows, after learning how to use them, improved their production efficiency, increased their yields, and also promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, pointing out the path forward for the farmers. The Wang Shuangyin mutual aid team in Dazhao Village, initially consisting of only nine households, has expanded to nineteen households since using the new-style walking plow, as nearby farmers saw from the facts that "the new plow is indeed better than the old plow" and eagerly requested to join the mutual aid team (because only by participating in the mutual aid team would they have the strength to purchase the new-style walking plow). The team plans to buy four more new-style walking plows. After achieving practical results through the use of the new-style walking plow, the organization became more consolidated than before, and the entire team was transformed into a production cooperative in February of this year.

"The New-Style Walking Plow is Not as Good as the Old Plow"

The supply and marketing cooperative in the district encountered many twists and turns, overcame many difficulties, created experience, and mastered guiding techniques in the process of promoting the new-style walking plow, so that the new-style walking plow could be promoted.

In 1951, the Fourth District Cooperative transported more than 100 new-style walking plows from the county agricultural tool station. At that time, it neither selected key points for promoting new-style agricultural tools to create experience, nor did it explain the methods of use and repair to the masses. It only talked about the benefits of using the new-style walking plow. After the land reform, farmers were eager to improve production and their lives because they had land. After hearing cadres say "using the new plow can plow deeper, the bottom of the furrow is flat, the livestock pulls it steadily and easily, the soil is turned evenly, the production rate is high, and more grain can be harvested...", and that the price was cheap, and poor households could also get loans from the government, everyone was willing to buy the new-style walking plow. In Dazhao Village, Wang Laibin, Dawanglou... and other five townships in the district alone, 106 units were sold.

After the local farmers bought the new plow, they did not know how to use it, so they groped to use it like the old plow. As a result, phenomena such as the plow body tilting from side to side, the heel not touching the ground, the plowed land being uneven, requiring special effort to hold the plow, and the livestock pulling it very laboriously all occurred. Many people felt that the new plow was clumsier and slower than the old plow, they didn't know how to tighten loose screws, or how to loosen tight screws, and they couldn't repair broken parts... A series of problems could not be solved. They looked for cooperative cadres, but the cooperative cadres were also laymen, and as a result, most of the new-style walking plows purchased by the farmers were left unused at home. The masses had different opinions. Some people said, "What new-style walking plow, it's all a scam." The elderly said, "New gadgets are ultimately not good, the old plow is still better." Some simply returned the purchased plows to the cooperative.

Focus on Experimentation, Summarize Experience

The cadres of the district cooperative felt that if this problem was not resolved in time, not only would the promotion of the new-style walking plow be affected, and the new plows bought by the masses would have to be returned, but also the cooperative would create a very bad influence among the masses, and future work would be difficult. After research and analysis, they found the reasons, realized that to promote the new-style walking plow, it was necessary to learn the technology, impart the technology, select key points, cultivate typical examples, create experience, and let the farmers see the benefits of using the new plow from practical examples, and then they could promote it comprehensively. Therefore, they decided to focus on the Wang Shuangyin mutual aid team and the Zhao Zhanzhong mutual aid team, which had a better work foundation. The Wang Shuangyin mutual aid team was an advanced mutual aid team. He had participated in several county labor model conferences and Henan Province labor model conferences, and had visited advanced mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives and farms elsewhere. He not only learned how to use the new-style walking plow, but also learned how to repair it, so the seven-inch walking plow he bought was used very well. However, the mutual aid teams in the district rarely had the opportunity to exchange experiences together, and some mutual aid teams did not know how to use the seven-inch walking plow and complained that "the seven-inch walking plow is not good." Although the Zhao Zhanzhong mutual aid team knew how to use the new-style walking plow, they still had some doubts about whether using the new-style walking plow could produce more grain and improve work efficiency. The cadres helped them with an experiment: Last year, they planted millet on the same two mu of land, one mu was cultivated with the new-style walking plow, and one mu was cultivated with the old plow, using the same seeds and the same amount of manure. As a result, the mu of land cultivated with the old plow only yielded four dou of millet, while the mu of land cultivated with the seven-inch walking plow yielded four dou and three hu of millet (25 jin per hu).

Why can the use of the new plow produce more grain? (1) The seven-inch walking plow generally plows two to three inches deeper than the old plow, which can utilize the fertility of the fertile soil below the surface layer. (2) After the old plow plows, there are soil ridges below. The new plow turns the soil evenly and completely. After plowing, the bottom of the furrow is flat, which can completely press the topsoil underneath, which can cover weeds, rot the grass, increase fertility, and completely turn the underground larvae and insect eggs to the ground, and destroy them by sun or frost.

The new plow is also more efficient than the old plow in terms of farming efficiency, and both people and animals save energy. According to the Zhao Zhanzhong mutual aid team's experiment, as long as the front cutter and guide wheel of the plow are adjusted properly, it will be stable when people hold it, and the livestock will pull it easily; the team used the same livestock to plow 2.78 mu of land per day using the new-style plow, but less than 2 mu with the old plow. The plowshare of the old plow is easily broken, while the plowshare of the new plow is strong and durable.

Hold Technical Exchange Meetings to Comprehensively Promote New-Style Walking Plows

In order to dispel the concerns of farmers about using the new-style walking plow and enable farmers to learn the technology, the Fourth District Cooperative summarized the methods and effects of using the new plow by these two mutual aid teams, the comparison with the old plow, and the experience of repairing and adding parts. In September of last year, under the leadership of the district party and government, a joint meeting of mutual aid team leaders from the entire district was held. At the meeting, Wang Shuangyin and Zhao Zhanzhong, two real people and real things, were used to explain to everyone face-to-face, and Wang Shuangyin and Zhao Zhanzhong gave specific introductions to the methods of using the new plow. The meeting also stipulated that the cooperative would guarantee the supply of broken parts. This dispelled everyone's "knots" and convinced them that "the new plow is indeed better than the old plow."

After this meeting, the mutual aid teams in the district, with the help of cadres, learned from each other how to use the new plow. They learned it, and their enthusiasm increased. The Guo Shihai mutual aid team in Wanglou Township originally had only three seven-inch walking plows. After the team members learned how to use the new plow, they recently bought three more new-style walking plows. The Zhao Zhanzhong mutual aid team originally had two new plows, and later bought three more. Some farmers originally clamored to return the plows to the cooperative, but now not only did they not return them, but some are also adding to them. In total, the district sold 56 new-style walking plows in the half month after the meeting of mutual aid team leaders, bringing the total to 162 units. Because the farmers in the district saw the real benefits of using the new-style walking plow, they all ordered from the cooperative. The district cooperative is confident that it will sell another 100 seven-inch walking plows in the second quarter.

From these situations, it can be seen that the work of promoting new-style agricultural tools, like other work, must not be impatient, rash, or blindly promoted. Instead, it must find key points, create experience, and let farmers see the benefits from concrete examples based on their own experiences and needs. As long as they learn how to use it, the promotion of new-style agricultural tools can be smooth, and it will not turn a good thing into a bad thing, and it will meet the urgent needs of the vast number of farmers to develop production.

    “新犁真比旧犁好！”
    ——记河南遂平县四区合作社推广新式步犁前后
    吴崭
    “新犁真比旧犁好！”河南遂平县四区农民时常赞扬合作社替他们办了这样一件好事。该区系平原地带，七吋步犁是该地农民迫切需要的农具之一。从一九五一年起到去年麦收后，该区合作社共推销了新式步犁一百六十二部，是全县推销新式步犁最多的一个区。该区购买新式步犁的农民，在学会使用新式步犁后，提高了生产效率，增加了产量，同时还推动了互助合作运动的发展，给农民指出了前进的道路。该区大赵庄乡王双印互助组，开始组织时只有九户，自从使用新式步犁后，附近农民从事实中看到“新犁的确比旧犁好”，都纷纷要求加入互助组（因为参加了互助组才有力量购买新式步犁），后来该组增加到十九户，并计划再买新式步犁四部。该组经过使用新式步犁获得实效后，组织较前更加巩固，今年二月间全组已转为生产合作社。
    “新式步犁不如旧犁好”
    该区供销合作社在推广新式步犁的过程中，费了不少周折，突破许多困难，创造了经验，掌握了指导技术，使新式步犁得以推广。
    四区合作社在一九五一年由县农具站运到一百多部新式步犁，当时既没有选择推广新式农具的重点，以便创造经验；又没有向群众交代使用和修理的方法，只是空谈使用新式步犁的好处。农民在土地改革后，由于有了土地，正迫切要求提高生产改善生活，听干部说了“使用新犁能犁得深，犁底平，牲口拉起来稳当轻便，翻土均匀，生产率高，能多打粮食……”等许多好处，且价钱便宜，贫苦户还能得到政府的贷款，所以大家都愿意购买新式步犁。单在该区大赵庄、王来宾、大王楼……等五个乡就销出了一百零六部。
    该地农民买到新犁后，不知道如何用法，就摸索着照旧犁那样使用。于是，犁身左右倒，后踵不着地，犁过的土地凸凹不平，扶犁时特别费劲，牲口拉起来也非常吃力等现象都发生了。许多人觉得新犁比旧犁又笨又慢，螺丝松了又不会紧，螺丝紧了又不会松，零件坏了又不能修理……这一连串的问题都无法解决。他们找合作社干部，可是合作社干部也是门外汉，结果农民买到的新式步犁大部都放在家里不用。群众意见纷纷，有人说：“啥新式步犁，全是坑人的。”老年人说：“新玩艺到底不行，还是旧犁好。”有的干脆把买来的步犁退给合作社。
    重点试验，总结经验
    该区合作社干部感到这问题如不及时解决，不仅新式步犁的推广要受到影响，群众买去的新犁要退回来，而且合作社要在群众中造成很坏的影响，以后的工作也不好作了。他们经过研究分析，找出原因，认识到推广新式步犁必须要学会技术，传授技术，并选好重点，培养典型，创造出经验，使农民从实际例子中看到使用新犁的好处，然后再能全面推广。于是他们确定以工作基础较好的王双印互助组及赵占中互助组为重点。王双印互助组是一个先进的互助组，他参加过几次县劳动模范大会及河南省劳动模范大会，并参观过别处先进的互助组、农业生产合作社和农场，他不仅学会了使用新式步犁，并学会了修理的方法，所以他这个组买的七吋步犁使用的很好。但该区各互助组很少有机会在一块交流经验，有的互助组不会使用七吋步犁，就瞒怨“七吋步犁不好”。赵占中互助组虽然会使用新式步犁，但对使用新式步犁能多打粮食，提高工作效率还有些怀疑。干部就帮助他们试验：该组去年在同样的二亩地上种谷子，一亩用新式步犁耕耘，一亩使用旧犁耕耘，用同样的种籽，上同样的粪，结果使用旧犁耕种的一亩地只打了四斗谷子，用七吋步犁耕种的一亩地却打到四斗三斛谷子（每斛二十五斤）。
    为什么使用新犁能多打粮食呢？（一）七吋步犁一般要比旧犁多犁二至三吋深，这样便可以利用地层下面肥沃土壤的肥力。（二）旧犁犁过后，下面有土埂，新犁翻土均匀、完全，犁过后犁底平坦，可以把表土整个压在下面，既能掩盖杂草，把草沤烂，增加肥力，又可把地下幼虫及虫卵完全翻到地面上来，经日晒或冰冻将其消灭。
    新犁在耕作效率上也要比旧犁高，人畜都省劲。据赵占中互助组试验，使用时只要将犁前端的利刀及导轮调整好，人扶着就会稳当，牲口拉起来也轻便；该组用同样的牲畜，使用新式犁每天犁地二亩七分八，但用旧犁犁不到二亩。旧犁的犁铧容易被打断，新犁的犁铧则坚牢耐用。
    举行技术交流会，全面推广新式步犁
    四区合作社为了解除农民使用新式步犁的顾虑，使农民学会技术，便把这两个互助组使用新犁的方法、效果及与旧犁的对比，以及修理、添配零件等的经验总结起来，于去年九月间，在该区党政领导下召开了一个全区互助组组长联席会。在会上拿王双印及赵占中两个互助组使用新式步犁的活人、活事，对大家当面讲解，并由王双印和赵占中两人把使用新犁方法作具体介绍。会上并规定零件坏了由合作社保证供应。这样就解除了大家心中的“疙瘩”，都确信“新犁到底比旧犁强”了。
    该区各互助组在这次会议后，在干部的帮助下，都互相学习使用新犁。他们学会了，劲头就大了。王楼乡郭世海互助组原来只有三部七吋步犁，组员们学会使用新犁后，最近又买了三部新式步犁。赵占中互助组原有两部新犁，后来又买了三部。有些农民原来吵着要把步犁退还合作社，现在不但不退了，有的还在添制。总计该区在召开互助组组长会议后的半月内，全区销售新式步犁五十六部，连前共一百六十二部。由于该区农民看到了使用新式步犁的真正好处，都纷纷向合作社订购。该区合作社在第二季度有把握再推销七吋步犁一百部。
    从这些情况看，推广新式农具工作，也与其他工作一样，切不可急躁、冒进，盲目推广。而必须找好重点，创造经验，根据农民的切身体验和需要，使农民从具体事例中看到好处。只要他们学会使用的方法，推广新式农具才能顺利，才不致将好事办坏，才适合广大农民发展生产的迫切要求。
