[This News Report] Under the leadership of local Party committees, trade union organizations in various provinces and cities have successively begun to consolidate labor discipline through persuasive education and methods of criticism and self-criticism, based on the workers' conscious efforts.

The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions issued instructions on consolidating labor discipline on July 6th and 7th, respectively, requiring factories and mines to conduct a concentrated education on labor discipline in July and August, closely combining it with the central work, to reverse the phenomenon of lax labor discipline and ensure the victorious completion of the state plan. The instructions pointed out that in carrying out this work, it must be clearly recognized that consolidating labor discipline is an internal matter of the working class, and therefore, the policy of education must be adhered to, and the erroneous practices of adopting crude struggle methods or simply punishing must be resolutely prohibited. Finally, on the basis of improved mass awareness, factory rules and regulations should be established and some unreasonable systems should be revised according to mass opinions and practical needs, and promulgated by the administrative side in a formal order. The Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League should ensure the implementation of these systems. When conducting labor discipline education, it is also necessary to combine it with solving some specific problems, such as improving working conditions, strengthening labor protection, strengthening planning management, and organizing workers to carry out proper recreational activities, so that employees can fundamentally develop habits of order and discipline. Units undergoing democratic reform may postpone the campaign.

The Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions issued instructions on July 1st regarding the education of workers on strengthening labor discipline. In addition to pointing out specific methods of conducting education, paying attention to long-term effects, and establishing a clear reward and punishment system, it emphasized combining it with labor emulation. If the work of consolidating labor discipline is divorced from competition and central work, and carried out in isolation, it is inappropriate and impossible to do well.

Many factories, mines, and basic construction units in Jiangsu Province have begun to attach importance to the work of consolidating labor discipline. Some units have combined it with production tasks to carry out inspections and education on consolidating labor discipline, and have improved the workers' awareness of abiding by labor discipline. In the first half of June, the attendance rate of the state-owned Nanjing Telecommunications Repair Factory reached 98.8%, basically eliminating absenteeism, lateness, early departures, and unwarranted leave. In early June, Wuxi Shenxin No. 3 Factory held a political study class with more than 1,200 cadres participating to conduct education on consolidating labor discipline and break down concerns about struggling against violations of labor discipline. Subsequently, a wide range of publicity and education work was carried out among the masses, using various methods such as meetings, chats, comic strips, serial photos, and storytelling to publicize the reasons for consciously abiding by labor discipline; commend advanced workers who have consistently abided by labor discipline; and explain the harm of lax labor discipline to production by calculating detailed accounts. Trade union groups carried out criticism and self-criticism. The trade union also held forums for new workers in various departments to conduct education. After these efforts, there has been a significant improvement in production. In the old workshop, the absenteeism rate in May was 2.95%, which decreased to 1.157% in June, and the quality of fine yarn has also improved. Now, the Party and trade union in the factory are preparing to further deepen the education on labor discipline in conjunction with the discussion of the third quarter production plan. At the same time, they are preparing to promote the revision of necessary administrative management systems by the capitalists and do a good job in summer hygiene, ventilation, and reducing the temperature of the workshop. Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou cities are also carrying out education on consolidating labor discipline under the leadership of the local municipal Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party.

Wuhu and Hefei cities in Anhui Province have begun to rectify labor discipline. The Factory Committee of the Wuhu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed all factories to carry out a general education on consolidating labor discipline in June. The Hefei Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened workers' conferences of 13 factories twice on June 21st and 25th to commend workers Sun Yude, Hu Yaochang, and others who abide by labor discipline, and at the same time, severely punished individual elements who violated labor discipline. Bengbu City is also starting to rectify labor discipline.

Most factories and basic construction units in Chongqing City have successively begun education on consolidating labor discipline. The Industrial Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Southwest Iron and Steel Company, and the Southwest Iron and Steel Trade Union jointly held a meeting on June 26th to study the issue of rectifying labor discipline in the factories and mines under the Southwest Iron and Steel Company. The meeting criticized the erroneous attitude of leaders at all levels who were busy with production and relaxed political and ideological education, and who were tolerant and accommodating towards the phenomenon of lax labor discipline. It demanded that rectification be carried out seriously, and through this rectification, various reward and punishment systems should be established and improved, the scope of powers of workshop-level cadres and factory-level cadres should be clarified, the phenomenon of workshop-level cadres turning a blind eye to violations of labor discipline, allowing them to drift, and pushing them upwards should be overcome, and the responsibility of workshop-level cadres should be strengthened. After labor discipline education, units such as the 704 construction site of the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau and the Shashi Textile Factory have achieved preliminary results.

The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly convened a conference of cadres from the Party, administration, trade unions, and Communist Youth League of factories and basic construction units on July 2nd to further arrange the work of strengthening labor discipline. At the meeting, Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Liu Kegang, Deputy Manager of Angang, and Wang Jie, Secretary-General of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, all gave instructions, clearly stating that it is necessary to combine it with the current central work, implement the operation plan, and establish a responsibility system to strengthen labor discipline. In practice, on the one hand, it is necessary to prevent impetuous emotions and crude practices and adhere to the policy of persuasive education; on the other hand, it cannot be thought that strengthening labor discipline is a long-term task, so it can be done slowly, relaxing education, and accommodating the backward emotions of some workers.

The North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued instructions on strengthening education and consolidating labor discipline on June 18th, requiring that this work be regarded as one of the trade union's regular and important tasks. In the current labor emulation, this work should be combined with the transmission, study, and discussion of the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union to effectively solve the problem. Handan, Tangshan, and Longyan Iron Mines in Hebei Province, Datong Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province, and some enterprises in Beijing have successively begun to rectify labor discipline. The Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also convened a joint meeting of secretaries of the Party committees of state-owned factories and mines in mid-June to arrange this work.

    各省市工会组织在党的领导下开始进行劳动纪律的教育
    【本报讯】全国各省市工会组织，在各地中共党委领导下，采取说服教育的方法和批评与自我批评的方法，在群众自觉的基础上，先后开始进行巩固劳动纪律的工作。
    中共湖南省委和湖南省总工会，在七月六日和七日，分别发出关于巩固劳动纪律的指示，要求各厂矿在七、八两月间，密切结合中心工作，集中地进行一次劳动纪律的教育，扭转劳动纪律松弛的现象，保证国家计划的胜利完成。指示中提出在进行这项工作时，必须明确认识到巩固劳动纪律是工人阶级内部的问题，因而必须坚持教育的方针，坚决禁止采取粗暴的斗争方式或单纯惩办的错误作法。最后要在群众觉悟提高的基础上，根据群众意见和实际需要，建立厂规厂纪，修改某些不合理的制度，由行政方面以正式命令公布，党、工会和青年团要保证这些制度的执行。在进行劳动纪律教育的时候，还要结合解决一些具体问题，如改善劳动条件，加强劳动保护，加强计划管理，以及组织工人进行正当的娱乐活动，使职工从根本上养成守秩序、守纪律的习惯。正在进行民主改革的单位，可以暂缓进行。
    江西省总工会在七月一日发出关于对工人群众进行加强劳动纪律教育的指示，除了指出进行教育的具体方法、注意长期性和建立明确的奖惩制度之外，强调了要和劳动竞赛相结合。如果巩固劳动纪律的工作脱离竞赛、脱离中心工作，孤立地去进行是不妥当的，也是不可能做好的。
    江苏省许多厂矿和基本建设施工单位，开始重视巩固劳动纪律的工作，有些单位结合生产任务，进行了巩固劳动纪律的检查和教育，并且提高了职工遵守劳动纪律的自觉性。国营南京电信修配厂六月份上半月出勤率已达到百分之九十八点八，基本上消灭了旷工、迟到、早退及无故请假的现象。无锡申新三厂，六月初办了一个有一千二百多干部参加的政治学习班，进行巩固劳动纪律的教育，打破对破坏劳动纪律现象进行斗争的顾虑。接着，就在群众中广泛展开了宣传教育工作，用会议、漫谈、连环画、连环照片、说唱等各种方式，宣传为什么要自觉遵守劳动纪律的道理；表扬一贯遵守劳动纪律的先进工人；用算细账的方式，说明劳动纪律松弛对生产的危害性；通过工会小组开展批评与自我批评。工会又分部门召开了新工人座谈会，进行教育。经过这些工作，生产上已有了明显的好转。在老工场，五月份旷工率占百分之二点九五，六月份下降到百分之一点一五七，细纱质量也有了提高。现该厂党和工会正准备结合讨论第三季度生产计划，进一步深入劳动纪律的教育。同时，准备推动资方修订必要的行政管理制度，做好夏令卫生、通风、降低车间温度等工作。苏州、无锡、常州各市，也在当地中共市委的领导下，展开了巩固劳动纪律的教育。
    安徽省芜湖、合肥两市，已开始了整顿劳动纪律的工作。中共芜湖市委工厂委员会指示各厂在六月份中普遍进行一次巩固劳动纪律教育。合肥市总工会在六月二十一日和二十五日先后两次召开十三个工厂的职工大会，表扬了遵守劳动纪律的工人孙玉德、胡耀常等人，同时严肃处理了个别破坏劳动纪律的分子。蚌埠市也正在着手整顿劳动纪律。
    重庆市大部分工厂和基本建设单位，已先后开始了巩固劳动纪律的教育。中共重庆市委员会工业部、西南钢铁公司和西南钢铁工会，在六月二十六日联合召开会议，研究西南钢铁公司所属厂矿整顿劳动纪律的问题。会上批判了各级领导干部忙于生产，放松政治思想教育，对于劳动纪律松弛现象迁就姑息的错误态度，要求认真进行整顿，并通过这次整顿，建立和健全各种奖惩制度，划清车间一级干部与厂一级干部的职权范围，克服车间一级干部对违反劳动纪律不闻不问、任其自流、向上推的现象，加强车间一级干部的责任。西南建筑工程局七○四工地、沙市纺织厂等单位，经过劳动纪律的教育，已经收到初步效果。
    中共鞍山市委、市总工会、鞍山钢铁公司、青年团鞍山市委，于七月二日联合召开工厂和基本建设各单位党、行政、工会和青年团的干部大会，进一步布置了加强劳动纪律的工作。会上中共鞍山市委书记韩天石、鞍钢副经理刘克刚、市总工会秘书长王杰都作了指示，明确提出要结合当前中心工作，贯彻执行作业计划，建立责任制，来加强劳动纪律。在做法上，一方面要防止急躁情绪和粗暴的做法，坚持说服教育的方针；另一方面，也不能认为加强劳动纪律是长期性的工作，就可以慢慢去做，放松教育，迁就部分工人的落后情绪。
    全国总工会华北工作委员会在六月十八日发出关于加强教育巩固劳动纪律的指示，要求把这一工作当成工会经常的重大的任务之一，在当前劳动竞赛中，把这一工作与中国工会第七次全国代表大会决议的传达、学习、讨论结合进行，做到有效地解决问题。河北省邯郸、唐山、龙烟铁矿，山西大同矿务局，北京市部分企业，都已先后开始整顿劳动纪律。中共北京市委工业部，也在六月中旬召开了各国营厂矿党委书记联席会议，布置了这个工作。
