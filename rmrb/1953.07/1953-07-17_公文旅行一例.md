    An Example of Bureaucratic Red Tape
    Ping Ye
    In the fight against bureaucracy, we must never underestimate the harm of red tape, because red tape is fundamentally caused by bureaucratic work style. However, red tape, in turn, protects bureaucratic work styles and resists criticism from all sides. In this way, many official documents, or "red tape," busily travel and rapidly multiply under the wings of bureaucracy, while some leading cadres relish sitting in their offices signing documents, treating this "leadership" on paper as the primary method of leadership.
    On February 5, 1953, the Public Security Department of Suiyuan Province sent a request to the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government for instructions regarding the training expenses for the civil police. Thus, this request began its long journey.
    After receiving this request, the Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government immediately forwarded it to the Finance Department for approval. The Finance Department believed that it was a cadre training expense and should be handled by the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee's Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-bureau, and returned the request to the Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government. The Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government then sent the request to the Organization Department. The Organization Department believed that this request should be decided by the Government Personnel Department and returned it to the Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government. The Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government then forwarded it to the Personnel Department's Establishment Committee for a reply. The Personnel Department believed that the civil police were not cadres and returned the request. The Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government then forwarded it to the Finance Department. The Finance Department emphasized that there were cadres among the trainees and that the training expenses should be paid from the cadre expenses. The Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government was helpless and had to hand the request over to the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, who still assigned it to the Personnel Department. At this time, the Personnel Department discovered that the living expenses of these trainees were all supplied by their original units and did not need to be paid, only the cadre training expenses needed to be paid by the Finance Department. The Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government considered that it had been so long and still could not be resolved, so it sent the request to the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government. Based on the instructions of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, the Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government then handed the request over to the Personnel Department and the Public Security Department for contact. At that time, the Public Security Department said: "The person in charge is not here, and we don't know how much money to spend. Let's solve it later." After a long time, after the Public Security Department sent someone to discuss the situation in person, it was confirmed that this request was full of errors: the original request said there were seventy trainees, but in reality, there were only forty; the original said there were forty company, platoon, and squad cadres, but in reality, they were all soldiers and some squad cadres; the estimated training period was seventeen days, but in reality, it only took seven days. On March 10th, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government convened the heads of the Finance and Personnel Departments to study the matter face-to-face, and finally decided that the civil police training expenses would be resolved by the Finance Department from the administrative expenses.
    This "traveler" – the request – after the "hospitality," "reception," and "transfers" of the Office of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, the Finance Department, the Organization Department of the Sub-bureau, the Personnel Department, clerks, section chiefs, directors, department heads, secretaries-general, and the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, arduously passed through dozens of "stations," and only then found a foothold.
    Why is the "traveler" so busy? It turns out that before the request was sent out, not only did the department head not see it, but even the head of the general affairs section did not see it. A careless clerk wrote it and sent it to the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government. Each undertaking unit only handled the document based on the document, neither reviewed nor researched it, and no one was able to discover the errors in the request in time. We can't help but ask this comrade who sent out the request privately: Why did you write it so carelessly without any basis, causing so many people to get entangled? At the same time, we must also ask these comrades who handle the documents: Why, within an organization, do you have to waste valuable manpower and time on signing documents instead of contacting each other by phone or solving the problem face-to-face?
    The phenomenon of bureaucratic red tape severely hinders the progress of national construction. Although it is like a black spot on the sun, it is still a black spot after all. And it is a hateful black spot, a black spot that is contagious. If we do not resolutely endure the "pain" to dig out this black spot and overcome the phenomenon of red tape, then many cadres will be made to rush back and forth with the endless flow of official documents, and the lively and vigorous experiences and creations of the broad masses will become lifeless things, and all urgent events will be delayed in the hands of the red tape. We cannot tolerate this phenomenon continuing. We must all work hard to eliminate this kind of phenomenon.

    公文旅行一例
    平野
    在反官僚主义斗争中，绝不能轻视文牍主义之为害，因为文牍主义根本上是由官僚主义作风所造成。但是，文牍主义又反转来为官僚主义作风掩护，抵挡各方面的责难。这样许多公文“文牍”就在官僚主义的羽翼下忙碌地旅行，飞速地繁殖，而某些领导干部却津津有味地坐在机关里签公文，并把这签署公文的纸上的“领导”，当作主要的领导方法。
    一九五三年二月五日绥远省公安厅给省人民政府主席送去个请示民警训练经费的签报。于是这个签报就开始了它的长途旅行。
    省人民政府主席办公室接到这份签报后，即批到财政厅批复；财政厅认为是干部训练费，应由中共中央蒙绥分局组织部批办，将签报退省人民政府主席办公室；省人民政府主席办公室又把签报送组织部；组织部认为这项请示应由政府人事厅决定，又退回省人民政府主席办公室；省人民政府主席办公室又转交人事厅编制委员会答复，人事厅认为民警不是干部，将签报退回；省人民政府主席办公室又转交财政厅，财政厅强调受训人员中有干部，训练经费应从干部费内开支；省人民政府主席办公室无法，只好将签报交省府秘书长，秘书长仍交人事厅主办。这时，人事厅发现这些受训者的生活费用都是由原机关供给的，并不需要开支生活费用，只要由财政厅开支干部训练费用即可。省人民政府主席办公室认为时间这样久还不能解决，遂将签报送省人民政府主席，省人民政府主席办公室根据省人民政府主席批示，又将签报交由人事厅和公安厅联系，当时公安厅说：“主管人不在，花钱多少不知道，等以后再解决吧。”又过了很久，待公安厅去人面谈情况后，才证实这个签报根本就是错误百出的：原签报说受训者七十人，实际上只有四十人；原说有连、排、班级干部四十人，实际都是战士和一些班级干部；预计训练十七天，实际只要七天。到三月十日，省府秘书长召集财政、人事二厅负责人当面研究后，才最后决定民警训练经费由财政厅从行政费内解决。
    这位“旅客”——签报，经过省人民政府主席办公室、财政厅、分局组织部、人事厅、科员、科长、主任、厅长、秘书长、省人民政府主席等等的“招待”、“接见”、“接送”，辛辛苦苦地经过了数十道“站口”，至此才算找到一点着落。
    “旅客”何以如此忙碌？原来签报发出前不但厅长未看，连总务科长都未看，一位粗心大意的科员写好就送省人民政府主席去了。各承办单位只是就文办文，既不审查也不研究，竟无一人能及时发觉签报的错误所在。我们不禁要问一问私自送出签报的这位同志，为什么要毫无根据地乱写一顿，竟害得这么多的人纠来缠去呢？同时我们也要问一问：这些承办文件的同志们：为什么在一个机关内，不用电话联系或当面解决，偏要把宝贵的人力和时间消磨在签署公文上呢？
    文牍主义中的公文旅行现象严重地障碍着国家建设事业的前进。虽然它犹如太阳上的黑点，但终竟还是黑点。而且是可厌的黑点，是会传染人的黑点。如果不决心忍“痛”地挖出这个黑点，克服文牍主义现象，那末，将使很多干部随着川流不息的公文而往返奔忙，使广大群众的生动活泼的经验和创造变成毫无生气的东西，使一切急要事件在文牍主义者手中迟缓下来。我们是不能容忍这种现象继续下去的，我们大家一定要努力消灭这类现象。
