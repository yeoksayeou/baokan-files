Comrades, Delegates, Esteemed Guests:

    The Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has now come to a victorious close.

    Our congress has successfully completed the glorious mission entrusted to us by all Youth League members and the vast number of young people. We have listened to, discussed, and adopted Comrade Hu Yaobang's work report entitled "Unite the Youth of the Whole Country and Advance Courageously in the Great Ranks of Building the Motherland." This report summarizes the work experience of the Youth League over the past four years and stipulates the work guidelines and tasks of the Youth League during the period when the country enters planned economic construction, leading the Chinese youth movement into a new historical stage. We listened to Comrade Li Chang's report on the revision of the Constitution of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and discussed and adopted the new Constitution. This new Constitution will be more adaptable to the current situation and tasks, and will further consolidate the organization of the League and improve the work of the League. We elected the Second Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, strengthening the leadership of the Youth League. We believe that this session of the Central Committee of the Youth League will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, mobilize all League members and young people, correctly implement the resolutions of the congress in practical actions, and work together with the people of the whole country to gradually realize the country's industrialization and gradually transition to socialism.

    The tremendous achievements of our congress are inseparable from the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the cordial concern of Chairman Mao. Before the meeting, the Party Central Committee continuously guided and assisted us in the preparatory work for the congress; on the eve of the meeting, Chairman Mao and the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee gave valuable instructions on the work of the Youth League; at the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Liu Shaoqi made an important speech to the congress on behalf of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao; and today, Commander-in-Chief Zhu gave us valuable instructions to our congress. In particular, on June 30, Chairman Mao personally received the presidium of our congress and gave extremely important instructions to the congress, encouraging the youth to be healthy, study well, and work well. We are very grateful to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for their concern and guidance for the Youth League. We deeply realize that the great Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader and mentor, Comrade Mao Zedong, are the lighthouse of the Chinese youth movement. Under its radiant light, the Chinese youth movement will continue to advance from victory to victory. We solemnly assure the Party and Chairman Mao that the Chinese New Democratic Youth League will definitely take the instructions of the Party as its direction of advancement, resolutely respond to the call of the Party, and strive to play its role as the Party's assistant and reserve force.

    We also warmly thank Comrades Li Fuchun, Deng Zihui, and Qian Junrui for the important reports they made to the congress. We must mobilize all League members to work with boundless loyalty to the motherland and the people, resolutely devote one's own energy and light from their own work positions, and play the role of a shock brigade on all fronts of national construction.

    Our congress was honored to receive the congratulations from the representatives of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation at the opening ceremony. We were honored to receive congratulatory telegrams and letters from people and youth from all walks of life across the country. These congratulations expressed the hopes and encouragement of the people and youth of the whole country to the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and demonstrated the close unity between Youth League members and the broad masses of youth and the broad masses of the people. All of our League members will further unite the youth of the whole country with practical actions to defend and build the motherland, and thank the people and youth of the whole country for their congratulations.

    We are particularly honored that the congress received the presence and congratulations of representatives of democratic youth organizations from the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and some countries in the East and West. We thank the representative of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League. The glorious Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League, cultivated by Lenin and Stalin, will always be a model for the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to learn from. The brotherly and close unity of the youth of China and the Soviet Union will add a bright luster to the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. We thank the youth representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, the Mongolian People's Republic, India, Japan, Indonesia, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Australia. We thank the youth organizations from all countries around the world who sent congratulatory telegrams to the congress. All these warm congratulations demonstrate the friendship and unity between Chinese youth and the youth of all countries, and give Chinese youth great encouragement. The Chinese New Democratic Youth League is determined to unite the youth of the whole country, further promote the spirit of internationalism, strengthen unity with the youth of all countries, and strive to defend Asian and world peace and strive for a better future for the youth.

    Our congress is a mobilization meeting for all League members at the time when the motherland begins to enter a period of planned economic construction. Our future task is to implement the valuable instructions given to us by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the resolutions and spirit of the congress, into the practical actions of all League members and youth, and to make a heroic and bold advance towards building our great motherland. All members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League will surely, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, unite the youth of the whole country, engage in creative labor, study Marxism-Leninism diligently, improve their level of awareness, learn cultural science and technology, and strengthen their physical fitness. In the great cause of building the motherland, we will fulfill the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and Chairman Mao. We will, in accordance with the policies formulated by the congress, consolidate and develop our League, in industrial construction, in agricultural production, in national defense construction, in schools, in institutions, in united front work and international activities, so that the League can better become the Party's assistant, complete the glorious tasks given to us by the Party on every construction front, better establish our League's regular work, better carry out activities among the youth masses, and promote a lively and healthy style. Our League must and will certainly achieve greater success in all aspects after this congress.

    The cause of communism will be victorious, the great cause of world peace and democracy will be victorious, and the national fortune of our motherland, the People's Republic of China, will become increasingly prosperous under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Nothing in the world can hinder this great force of advancement. Let us move forward!

    Long live the great unity of the youth of China!

    Long live the great unity of the youth of the world!

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people and the mentor of the youth, Chairman Mao!

    在青年团第二次全国代表大会闭幕会上
    廖承志同志的闭幕词各位代表、各位来宾、各位同志：
    中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会，现在胜利地闭幕了。
    我们的大会，圆满地完成了全体青年团员和广大青年所给予我们的光荣使命，我们听取、讨论和通过了胡耀邦同志所作的题为“团结全国青年，在建设祖国的伟大行列中奋勇前进”的工作报告，这个报告，总结了过去四年来青年团的工作经验，规定了在国家进入有计划的经济建设时期青年团的工作方针与任务，把中国青年运动，引上一个新的历史阶段。我们听取了李昌同志所作的中国新民主主义青年团团章修改报告，讨论和通过了新的团章。这个新的团章将更能适应当前的形势和任务，将进一步巩固团的组织和提高团的工作。我们选举了中国新民主主义青年团第二届中央委员会，加强了青年团的领导。我们相信，这一届的青年团中央委员会，必能在中国共产党的领导下，继承和发扬中国新民主主义青年团的优良传统，动员全体团员和青年，正确地在实际行动中贯彻大会的各项决议，和全国人民一道，为逐步实现国家的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义而奋斗。
    我们的大会所以能获得这样巨大的成绩，是和党中央的领导与毛主席的亲切关怀不可分的。在开会以前，党中央不断地指导和帮助我们大会的准备工作；开会前夕，毛主席和党中央的领导同志又对青年团的工作作了宝贵的指示；会议开始，刘少奇同志又代表党中央和毛主席向大会作了重要讲话，今天朱总司令又向我们大会作了宝贵的指示，特别是在六月三十日毛主席又亲自接见了我们大会主席团，对大会作了极其重要的指示，勉励青年们要身体好，学习好，工作好。我们十分感谢党中央和毛主席对青年团的关怀与指导，我们深深体会到，伟大的中国共产党和我们的亲爱领袖和导师毛泽东同志，是中国青年运动的灯塔，在它的光芒万丈的照耀下，中国青年运动将不断地从胜利走向胜利。我们庄严地向党和毛主席保证，中国新民主主义青年团一定把党的指示作为自己前进的方向，坚决响应党的号召，努力发挥它的作为党的助手和后备军的作用。
    我们同样热烈地感谢李富春同志、邓子恢同志、钱俊瑞同志对大会所作的重要报告。我们一定要发动全体团员，以对祖国对人民的无限忠诚，坚决从自己工作的岗位上，有一分热，放一分热，有一分光，发一分光，在国家建设各个战线上发挥突击队的作用。
    我们的大会，荣幸地接受了中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会的代表在开幕式中的祝贺，我们荣幸地接受了全国各界人民和青年的来电来信祝贺。这些祝贺，表达了全国人民和青年对中国新民主主义青年团的希望和鼓励，表现了青年团员和广大青年，广大人民之间的亲密团结。我们全体团员必将更进一步地团结全国青年以保卫和建设祖国的实际行动，答谢全国人民与青年对我们的祝贺。
    我们特别感到荣幸的是：大会得到了苏联、人民民主国家、东方及西方一些国家的民主青年团体的代表的光临和祝贺，我们感谢苏联列宁共产主义青年团的代表，光荣的为列宁、斯大林所培养起来的苏联列宁共产主义青年团，将永远是中国新民主主义青年团学习的榜样，中苏两国青年兄弟般的亲密团结，将为中苏两国人民的伟大的友谊增加鲜艳的光彩。我们感谢朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚、蒙古人民共和国、印度、日本、印度尼西亚、法国、意大利、英国、澳大利亚等国的青年代表，我们感谢向大会来电祝贺的全世界各个国家的青年组织，所有这些热忱的祝贺，都表现着中国青年与各国青年的友谊与团结，都给中国青年以莫大的鼓舞。中国新民主主义青年团决团结全国青年，进一步发扬国际主义精神，加强与各国青年的团结，为保卫亚洲及世界和平，为争取青年的更美好的未来而奋斗。
    我们的大会是全体团员在祖国开始进入有计划经济建设时期的誓师大会。我们今后的任务，就是要把党中央和毛主席所给予我们的宝贵指示，把大会的决议和精神，贯彻到全体团员和青年的实际行动中去，向建设我们的伟大祖国作英勇的、豪迈的进军。我们中国新民主主义青年团全体团员一定能够在中国共产党的领导下团结全国青年，创造性地从事劳动，努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高自己的觉悟程度，学习文化科学技术，并且锻炼好自己的身体。在建设祖国的伟大事业中，完成党和毛主席所提交给我们的光荣任务。我们将根据大会所制订的方针，巩固地向前发展我们的团，在工业建设、在农业生产、在国防建设、在学校中、在机关中、在统一战线工作和国际活动中，使团更好地成为党的助手，完成党在每一个建设战线上给予我们的光辉任务，更好地建立我们团的经常工作，更好地开展青年群众中的活动，和发扬活泼健康的作风。我们的团在这次大会之后，必定也必须在各方面收到更大的成就。
    共产主义事业是要胜利的，全世界和平民主的伟大事业是要胜利的，我们的祖国中华人民共和国的国运在毛主席领导下将日趋兴隆，世界上将没有任何东西可以阻碍这巨大的进军力量。让我们前进吧！
    全中国青年的大团结万岁！
    全世界青年的大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖和青年的导师毛主席万岁！
