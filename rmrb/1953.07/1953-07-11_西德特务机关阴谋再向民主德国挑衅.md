Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: West German and West Berlin fascist spy agencies are plotting new provocations against the German Democratic Republic and the democratic sector of Berlin.

The so-called "Research Advisory Committee" under the West German spy center "Ministry for All-German Affairs" in Bonn, headed by Minister Kaiser, held a meeting in West Berlin on the 6th, discussing the reasons for the disastrous failure of the June 17th provocation and formulating a plan for another "Day X." The "Ministry for All-German Affairs" is the department specifically responsible for activities aimed at splitting Germany and plotting civil war, and was also the agency that directly organized and directed the June 17th incident.

Kaiser's West Berlin "Daily Newspaper" openly stated that the "Research Advisory Committee" would continue to provoke armed conflict, and the representatives of the "Research Committee" believed that their current decisive task was to return the industry and land of the German Democratic Republic to the war criminals who originally owned them.

On July 8th, West Berlin spy agencies gathered several groups of fascist youth thugs and instructed them on how to organize new provocations. In front of the West Berlin Senate in the Schöneberg district of the American-occupied zone of West Berlin, about 150 young thugs held a meeting. On the same day, in the Wedding district of the French-occupied zone, 90 young thugs also held a gathering. These fascist hooligans carried provocative slogans and banners against the German Democratic Republic.

The Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic pointed out in a statement that the imperialist countries and the newspapers of West Germany and West Berlin have been making every effort in recent days to spread slanderous information, attempting to give the impression that new disturbances are brewing in the democratic sector of Berlin and the German Democratic Republic. This slander campaign demonstrates that they are planning to organize new attacks on Democratic Germany, incite disturbances, and undermine the peaceful construction of the Republic.

    西德特务机关阴谋再向民主德国挑衅
    【新华社十日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：西德和西柏林的法西斯特务机关，正在阴谋布置对德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区发动新的挑衅行动。
    西德特务中心波恩“全德事务部”部长凯撒辖下的所谓“研究顾问委员会”，六日在西柏林举行了会议，讨论了六月十七日挑衅事件遭到惨败的原因，并且拟订了发动另外一个“Ｘ日”的计划。“全德事务部”是专门负责分裂德国活动和策划内战的部门，也是直接布置和指挥六月十七日事件的机关。
    凯撒的西柏林“日报”公开说，“研究顾问委员会”继续要挑起武装冲突，“研究委员会”的代表们认为他们当前决定性的任务，就是要把德意志民主共和国的工业与土地归还给原来拥有它们的战犯。
    七月八日，西柏林的特务机关集合了好几批法西斯青年匪徒，指示他们如何组织新的挑衅行动。在西柏林美占区内绍尼堡区的西柏林参议会门前，一百五十名左右的青年匪徒在一起开会，同一天在法占区内的韦定区，也有九十名青年匪徒举行集会，这些法西斯流氓携带着反对德意志民主共和国的挑衅性的标语和旗帜。
    德意志民主共和国总理新闻处在它发布的一个声明中指出，帝国主义国家和西德及西柏林的报纸近几天来竭力散布诽谤性消息，企图给人一种印象，好像在柏林民主区及德意志民主共和国正酝酿新的骚动，它们这种诽谤运动说明他们正打算对民主德国组织新的进攻，挑起骚动，破坏共和国的和平建设。
