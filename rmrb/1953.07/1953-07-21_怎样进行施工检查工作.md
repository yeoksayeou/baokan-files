How to Conduct Construction Inspection Work

Xue Zhengyang, Specialized Engineer of the Large Factory Construction Site, First Construction Company

(I)

In the past, the various construction sites of the First Construction Company lacked inspection organizations, dedicated inspectors, and inspection systems for various projects. No one recognized the need for inspection work. As a result, construction errors were unavoidable, and rework and waste occurred frequently. For example, during the construction of a certain project, the blueprints were read upside down, and east and west became south and north. Several sand-turning pools were placed on the wrong lines. It was not until the stone wall was almost finished that the construction worker asked the engineer about the height of the wall. Upon reviewing the blueprints, the error was discovered, leading to a major rework. Another example involved cement pillars that had already been cast. When it came time to install the steel roof trusses, it was discovered that the bolt positions on top of the pillars were incorrect. The bolts on top of the pillars, which should have been horizontal, were mistakenly arranged vertically, preventing the roof trusses from being installed. Dozens of pillar bolts had to be dug out and re-cast and installed, delaying the roof project for a week. Furthermore, during the pouring of foundations for a certain project, the level measurement was rushed to meet the schedule. After measuring, construction proceeded immediately, resulting in some foundation surfaces exceeding the specified height by five to ten centimeters, requiring excavation, while other foundation surfaces were not high enough and needed to be supplemented.

Last year, the company established an inspection section. The section had few personnel, and there was a high degree of job mobility. An inspector only understood one line of work but was responsible for comprehensive inspection tasks. Some inspectors did not understand quality standards and operating procedures, and they did not study the construction drawings before inspecting a particular project. Therefore, they could not identify problems in the construction. Even if they sensed some problems, they could not explain them clearly. As a result, inspectors could only take a superficial look at the construction site. After spending the day, they would return to the company and mention some trivial matters as an explanation. On the other hand, some construction workers had an unclear understanding of inspection work and held a confrontational attitude. Some construction workers would shout, "The big shots are here!" or "The imperial envoys are here!" when they saw the inspectors coming. They would also come up with strange questions to stump the inspectors, making them afraid to speak up. They even gave the inspectors a nickname, calling them "free loaders." The inspectors felt that their work was very difficult, being squeezed from above and below, and feeling resentful. By the third quarter of last year, the construction tasks were tight, and the head of the inspection section was temporarily assigned to serve as the construction site director. Most of the inspectors also went to work as construction workers, leaving only a few people to guard the office within the section.

(II)

Learning from past experiences and lessons, this year our company has established an independent inspection organization at the large factory construction site, selected some construction cadres to serve as dedicated inspectors, designated an engineer to be specifically responsible for leading this work, and established a set of inspection systems in the responsibility system movement. Since the start of construction until the end of June, the inspection work has achieved good results. For example, during the construction inspection of the living room foundation project, it was discovered that the layout was off by 50 centimeters (the original regulation stipulated that the side deviation of the earthwork should not exceed 15 centimeters), the layout of the partition wall was off by 20 centimeters, a certain large foundation of the factory building was off by 15 centimeters (the original regulation did not allow any deviation), and the center line of the concrete column formwork for a certain crane beam was off by 3 millimeters (the original regulation stipulated that it should not exceed 2 millimeters). These deviations were corrected in a timely manner. Therefore, before the end of June, no large-scale rework was caused in any of the projects, and the quality standards were generally met. Because the inspection work played a role in ensuring quality, it changed the erroneous views of the construction workers and workers, and they were much friendlier to the inspectors than in the past. Whenever workers encountered inspectors, they would always ask, "How is the quality of this, is it good enough to get what grade?" The construction workers also felt that the inspection work was helpful to them.

How is our construction inspection work organized, and how is it carried out?

1. Establishing Correct Thinking About Construction Inspection. When the independent inspection organization at the large factory construction site was first established, the construction cadres who were assigned to work as inspectors were generally unwilling to do this kind of "resentful work" due to the negative impact of last year's inspection work. Some believed that "the superiors look down on me and assigned me to this work," while others said, "I'm sick, so the superiors sent me here." There was a general lack of enthusiasm for work. In response to this situation, we first explained that inspection work is to ensure the quality of the project, and the responsibility is very important. If this work is done well, and problems are discovered and corrected in a timely manner during the construction process, it will not only ensure the quality but also ensure the progress by avoiding rework. Therefore, inspection and construction are completely unified, and the positive role of inspection work lies in assisting construction. Everyone did not have a good impression of inspection work because the work was not done well last year.

2. Next, we analyzed the favorable conditions for this year's inspection work. Now that this year's inspection work is fixed at one construction site, it is not as fluid as it was last year; at the same time, there is a professional division of labor, with each person doing their own job. Those who were formerly bricklayer construction workers are now serving as bricklayer inspectors. This increased the inspectors' confidence.

3. Before construction started, we compiled quality standards and operating procedures for various projects, especially explaining the quality grade inspection and evaluation methods, as well as the inspection items, and organized discussions and studies so that everyone had a clear understanding and a clear goal for their work.

4. Our large construction site inspection team has a set of construction drawings. Before each project inspection, the drawings are distributed to each professional inspector for study, and the team leader is responsible for explaining them. After the drawings are understood, each inspector draws simple diagrams of what they want to inspect in a small notebook, noting the dimensions and direction. Inspector Chen Xudong said, "It's good to do this. If I didn't draw it once, it wouldn't be so clear in my mind, and the two center lines of the wall base and the basement would be seen as one, and a layout deviation of 50 centimeters would not be detected."

5. The problems that the inspectors find during their daily inspections are recorded in their notebooks in addition to notifying the construction workers, and then transcribed onto quality record cards at night. The quality record card is the original record of our inspection work. With this, it is easy to study and judge if problems occur afterward. In addition to recording the name of the sub-item project, type of work, team, start and end dates, construction process, and daily quality status, the quality record card also includes a quality grade assessment at the time of completion and acceptance. This record card also serves as the basis for issuing quality certificates.

6. The quality certificate is another system in our work. When each sub-part and sub-item project is completed, the construction worker and the team leader first conduct an inspection and fill out their inspection records on the certificate, then submit it to the inspection team for review. If it is deemed qualified, the certificate is issued with the consent of the chief engineer. With the quality certificate, the construction team can proceed to the next process of work, the finance and wage team can issue piece-rate wages to the workers, and the award evaluation team has a reliable basis for evaluating quality grades.

7. In order to distinguish the responsibilities of the inspectors and the construction workers and prevent mutual shirking of responsibility, we stipulate that if a deviation occurs without accepting the inspector's opinion, the construction worker is responsible; if a problem is not found during inspection, the inspector bears the main responsibility; if there are new deviations after inspection and modification, the inspector should be responsible, and the construction worker should also bear some responsibility.

8. In order to make the inspection work proceed in a planned manner, we have also compiled a "Monthly Inspection Plan Instruction Chart," which is compiled based on the monthly construction plan of the construction site. The content includes the name of the sub-part and sub-item projects, the responsible inspector, the nature and date of the inspection, the amount of work, and the required instruments and tools. The inspection items specify the inspection items for each type of work's sub-part project, the allowable deviation, the grade distinction, and the evaluation score. With this instruction chart, the inspection team's work can be prepared and planned, avoiding the chaotic situation of temporary assignments and not knowing how to start.

(III)

To do a good job in inspection, in addition to establishing systems, we must also pay attention to solving three problems. First, inspectors and construction workers must unite and work together in a complementary manner. The attitude of the inspection staff should be correct first. When we are arranging work, we often bring up the issue of inspection attitude, repeatedly explaining that inspection work is not simply to find faults but to help construction, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner to avoid rework and waste. In the past two months, most of the inspectors have been able to be kind, responsible, and conscientious, making many construction workers feel that they have gained another force. We can often see construction workers and inspectors carefully studying problems together on the site, and finally everyone happily saying, "Okay! If this is right, then let's do it this way!" For more important issues, the construction worker and the inspector will ask the inspection team leader for ideas and ask the chief engineer to make a decision. This has played a great role in the work. However, this issue has not been completely resolved, and sometimes we still hear about inspectors being "resentful," which needs further efforts to improve.

Second, the existing inspectors are all promoted from workers and construction workers, with low levels of education and technical skills. If they are not well-organized to learn, the inspection work cannot be improved further. To this end, we organize inspectors to learn mathematics, batching calculations, and enlargement methods every day, and we also hold a review and exam every weekend. In the past two months, the inspectors' cultural and technical levels have improved, and the work has begun. Some people did not know how to use record cards at the beginning, but now ten inspectors can keep the record cards in an orderly manner. Those who did not know integer arithmetic in the past have now learned decimal arithmetic. Inspector Lao Han said, "This year is great. Being an inspector is like living in a school." However, based on past experience, it is difficult to persist in amateur learning, and it often ends halfway due to work being too tight. This should be noted.

Third, any work that is separated from the masses will not work. The same is true for construction inspection work. If we do not strengthen mass inspection, we cannot do it well. Before the start of construction, we used a large class method to explain the quality standards and operating procedures to the workers, which played a certain role. For example, when washing stone workers find that the stones do not meet the specifications, they will automatically find the inspectors to ask if it is the same as what was said during the lecture. However, the workers' mass inspection, mutual inspection work is not done enough, and we need to further strengthen publicity and education to turn construction inspection into a mass work and lay a solid foundation for ensuring quality.

    怎样进行施工检查工作
    第一工程公司大型厂工地专责工程师　薛正扬
    （一）
    第一工程公司各工地从前没有检查组织，也没有固定的检查员，各项工程没有检查制度，谁也没有认识到检查工作的需要。因此，施工中的错误就不可避免，返工浪费现象不断发生。如在某号工程施工中把图纸看倒了，东、西变成了南、北，把几个翻砂池放错了线，等到块石墙快要砌完，施工员向工程师询问墙的高度，再查看图纸时才发现这个错误，造成大返工。又如水泥柱子已经打好，到了上钢屋架时才发现柱顶镙拴位置不对，柱顶镙拴本来应该横排而错成了竖排，屋架安装不上，几十个柱子的镙拴都要挖出重新浇灌安装，耽误屋面工程一周之久。再如某号工程浇灌基础时，水平测量只管赶进度，测完就施工，结果一部分基础面超过规定，需要挖去五公分至十公分，一部分基础不够高又需要增补。
    去年公司里设有一个检查科。科里人员少，工作流动性很大，一个检查员只懂一行，但他担负着全面检查任务。有些检查员不懂质量标准与操作规程，在检查某项工程前又没有研究过施工图纸，因而看不出施工中的问题，就是感到有些问题也说不出所以然来。这样，检查员只好在工地里走马看花，转了一天回到公司，把鸡毛蒜皮的事提一下作为交代。另外一方面，有些施工员对检查工作的认识不明确，抱着对立的态度。有的施工员见检查员来了就喊：“大员们来啦！”“钦差大人来啦！”并且出些怪问题把检查员难倒，使得他不敢开口。还给检查员起了一个称号，叫作“白吃饱”。检查员感到工作十分难做，上压下挤两头受气。到了去年第三季度，施工任务紧张，检查科长临时被派出担任工地主任，检查员也多去当了施工员，科内只有几个人看守办公室了。
    （二）
    接受过去的经验教训，今年我们公司在大型厂工地设立了独立检查机构，选派一些施工干部专任检查员，指定一个工程师专门负责领导这一工作，并在责任制运动中建立了一套检查制度。开工以来至六月底，检查工作已收到较好的效果。如在生活室基础工程施工检查中发现放线偏了五十公分（原规定土方侧边偏差最多不得超过十五公分）、间壁墙放线偏了二十公分，厂房某号大基础偏了十五公分
    （原规定不允许有偏差），某吊车梁混凝土柱模型板中心线歪了三公分（原规定最多不超过两公厘），这些偏差都及时得到纠正。因此，在六月底以前，各项工程未造成大量返工，普遍达到了质量标准。由于检查工作对保证质量起了作用，就改变了施工员和工人的错误看法，对检查员比过去亲近得多了。工人们每遇到检查员总要问：“我们这个质量怎样，够几级品呀？”施工员也感到检查工作对他们有些帮助了。
    我们的施工检查工作是怎样组织起来，是怎样进行工作的呢？
    一、树立正确的施工检查思想。大型厂工地独立检查机构刚刚成立的时候，被派来作检查员的施工干部，由于去年检查工作给他们的不良影响，大都不愿意干这种“受气的工作”，有的认为“上级看不起我，才派我干这工作”，有的说：“我有病，上级才派我来到这里”，普遍表现工作情绪不高。针对这种思想情况，我们首先说明检查工作是为了保证工程质量，责任是很重大的。如果这个工作做得好，在施工过程中及时发现问题及时纠正，不但保证了质量，而且由于避免了返工，也就保证了进度。因此，检查与施工是完全统一的，检查工作的积极作用在于帮助施工，大家对检查工作没有好的印象是因为去年的工作没有做好。
    二、接着我们就分析了今年检查工作的有利条件，如今年的检查工作固定在一个工地上，不像去年那样流动；同时专业分工，各干本行，原来是瓦工施工员，现在就担任瓦工检查员。这就增加了检查员的信心。
    三、我们在开工前，编制了各项工程的质量标准与操作规程，特别是向大家交代了质量的等级检查与评定办法，以及检查的项目，并组织讨论研究，使大家心里有底，工作有了明确的目标。
    四、我们大型工地检查组备有一套施工图纸，在每项工程检查前，把图纸分别交给各专业检查员进行学习，组长负责解释说明。在图纸看明白以后，各检查员把自己所要检查的简单图样划在小本子上，记上尺寸、方向。检查员陈旭东说：“这样做很好。如果我不划过一次，心里就不会那么清楚，墙基与地下室的两条中心线就会看成是一条，放线偏差五十公分就检查不出来。”
    五、检查员每天在检查时发现的问题，除通知施工员外，自己还记笔记，晚上誊写到质量记录卡片上去。质量记录卡片是我们检查工作的原始记录，有了这个东西就便于事后发生问题进行研究判断。记录卡片内除记有分项工程名称、工种、小组、开始至完成日期、施工经过、每日质量情况外，最后一项还有竣工验收时的质量等级评定。这个记录卡片也就成为填发质量合格证的根据。
    六、质量合格证是我们工作中的另一种制度，当每个分部分项工程竣工时，施工员和小组长先进行一次检查，在合格证上填写自己的检查记录，然后交检查组复查，如果认为合格，经主任工程师同意发出合格证。施工组有了合格证就可以进行下一个工序的工作，财务工资组有了它就可以发给工人计件工资，评奖小组评定质量等级时也有了可靠的根据。
    七、为了分清检查员与施工员的责任，防止互相推诿，我们规定：没有接受检查员的意见而出偏差，由施工员负责；检查而未发现问题，检查员负主要责任；检查修改后又有新的偏差，检查员应负责任，施工员也应负一部分责任。
    八、为了使检查工作有计划地进行，我们还编制了“月检查计划指示图”，这是根据工地每月施工计划编排的。内容有分部分项工程名称、专责检查人、检查的性质与日期、工程量、所需仪器与工具，在检查项目里规定了各工种分部工程的检查项目，容许偏差，等级区别及评定分数等，有了这个指示图表，检查组的工作就能有准备有计划地进行，避免了临时指派、不知如何下手的混乱情况发生。
    （三）
    要把检查工作做好，除建立制度外，还必须注意解决三个问题。第一，检查员与施工员必须团结一致，相辅而行。首先应该端正检查人员的态度。我们在布置工作时，经常提出检查态度问题，反复说明检查工作不是单纯为了找毛病，而是为了帮助施工，发现问题及时解决，避免返工浪费。两个多月来大多数检查员都能做到态度和气、认真负责，使许多施工员感到多了一把力量。我们经常可以看到，在现场里施工员和检查员一起认真研究问题，最后大家高兴地说：“好吧！这样对就这样干吧！”比较重要的问题，施工员和检查员就找检查组长出主意，并请主任工程师作决定。这对于工作起了很大的作用。但是，这个问题还未得到彻底解决，有时还会听到检查员“受气”的事情，这是需要进一步努力改进的。
    第二，现有的检查员都是从工人和施工员中提拔起来的，文化水平不高，技术水平很低，如果不很好地组织学习，检查工作就不能提高一步。为此，我们每天组织检查员学习数学、配料计算、放大样方法等，每周末还举行一次复习与考试。两个月来，检查员的文化与技术水平已有所提高、工作开始时有的人还不会使用记录卡片，现在十个检查员都能把记录卡片记得很有次序，过去不会整数四则的，现在连小数四则都学会了。检查员老韩说：“今年可好啦，当了检查员好比住了学校一样。”但是，根据过去的经验，业余学习是很难坚持下去的，往往由于工作紧张就会半途而废，这是应当注意的。
    第三，任何一件工作离开群众都是行不通的，施工检查工作也是一样，如果不加强群众性的检查也是搞不好的。我们在开工前曾用上大课的方式，向工人讲解了质量标准与操作规程，起了一定的作用。如洗石子工人发现石子不合规格，就自动找检查人员问是否和讲课时所说的一样。但是，工人群众的收工检查、互相检查工作还作得不够，还需要进一步加强宣传教育，把施工检查变成群众性的工作，为保证质量打下巩固基础。
