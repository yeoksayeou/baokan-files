Xinhua News Agency, London, July 12th: According to TASS, the British National Union of Mineworkers and the National Union of Railwaymen have held their annual meetings. Delegates attending both annual meetings believed that rising living costs were related to huge military expansion expenditures, and called for efforts to seek ways to ease international tensions.

According to newspaper reports, the National Union of Railwaymen, with 400,000 members, unanimously passed a resolution calling for a five-power conference and expressing regret that the Korean armistice negotiations were hampered by the provocations of the Syngman Rhee clique. The resolution also called for increased trade with all countries willing to trade with Britain, and specifically mentioned the development of trade between East and West.

Some delegates spoke of the unemployment and difficulties caused by trade restrictions imposed on Britain. The General Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, Campbell, announced that the three major railway workers' unions had jointly put forward a demand for a 15 percent wage increase.

The National Union of Mineworkers, with 700,000 members, unanimously passed a resolution at its annual meeting calling on the government to reduce the interest rates paid to former mine owners. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the heavy interest paid to former mine owners greatly increased the price of coal, thereby affecting the cost of living.

The meeting unanimously passed a resolution calling for the People's Republic of China to be admitted to the United Nations and calling on the British government to immediately use its influence to stop American imperialism from aiding Chiang Kai-shek.

    英国矿工联盟与全国铁路工人工会分别举行年会
    要求举行五大国会议缓和国际紧张局势
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十二日讯：英国全国矿工联盟与全国铁路工人工会分别举行年会。参加这两个年会的代表都认为生活费用上涨与庞大的扩张军备开支有关，并要求尽力来寻求缓和国际紧张局势的办法。
    据报纸报道，拥有四十万会员的全国铁路工人工会一致通过决议，要求举行五大国会议，并对因李承晚集团的挑衅行动而使朝鲜停战谈判受到阻碍表示遗憾。决议同时要求增加所有愿意与英国贸易的国家的贸易，并特别提到发展东西方之间的贸易。
    有一些代表谈到加于英国的贸易限制所引起的失业与困难。全国铁路工人工会总书记坎贝尔宣布有三大铁路工人工会联合提出了增加工资百分之十五的要求。
    拥有七十万会员的全国矿工联盟年会一致通过决议，要求政府减低付给前煤矿主的利率。在会上发言的代表指出付给前煤矿主的沉重利息大大地增加了煤的价格，因而影响了生活费用。
    会议一致通过一项决议，要求接纳中华人民共和国参加联合国，并要求英国政府立刻运用它的影响，制止美帝国主义援助蒋介石。
