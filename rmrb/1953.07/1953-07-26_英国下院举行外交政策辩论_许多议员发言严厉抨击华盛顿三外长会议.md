Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: TASS, London, July 24th: The British House of Commons discussed foreign policy issues related to Acting Prime Minister Butler's speech in the House of Commons on July 21st during a foreign policy debate. Butler elaborated on the characteristics of the British government's policy since Prime Minister Churchill's suggestion on May 11th to convene a "summit" meeting of major powers. Many speakers sharply criticized the government's policy, especially the position taken by the British representative Salisbury at the Washington Conference on the Korean issue, the German issue, and the convening of a major power representative meeting. Speakers unanimously pointed out that Salisbury, under pressure from the United States, had abandoned Churchill's May 11th proposal, and his position in Washington did nothing to ease international tensions.

Opposition leader Attlee, when talking about the resolutions of the Washington Conference, said: "What we first need to know is: Is there still hope for 'summit' negotiations, or, as everyone speculates, will a foreign ministers' meeting be used to replace this negotiation?" Attlee said that Churchill's speech on May 11th "advocated holding a meeting on the broadest basis, and tried to take advantage of what he thought (and I think, we all agree) had provided conditions that made some easing of tensions between East and West possible." Attlee advocated holding summit negotiations with the Soviet Union recently. He said that the Washington Conference "has not made any progress for us on the road to peace."

Attlee said that he was "absolutely not interested" in the foreign ministers' meeting predicted for September. He continued, it would be good if they could reach an agreement on some specific issue. But he did not think that the future of Germany was such an issue. Attlee said that in Europe, and to some extent in Britain, there was concern that Germany might once again become an armed threat to the world. He went on to say that the German question could only be resolved "in a future plan for a peaceful Europe." He said: "I think the whole world is looking forward to a new path, and we all thought that this path already existed."

Attlee elaborated on the White Paper published by the Washington Conference, saying: "It was impossible to expect much from these negotiations in the first place, and the White Paper brought disappointment... Now the impression has been created that we have expressed our position and expect the Soviet Union to take this position as well. I also found the same situation in the Far East issue, that is: we take such a position, and also ask the other party to take such a position. I don't think this route is very effective. It would be absurd to think that other countries' governments would definitely agree."

Attlee concluded: "I hope to see extensive trade between Eastern and Western Europe. I hope to trade with China. I especially hope for exchanges between countries. I think tensions have eased somewhat. If negotiations can promote our mutual understanding and guarantee exchanges between countries, then the situation will be more hopeful. But, frankly, I don't think the Washington negotiations have made any progress for us on the road to peace."

Liberal Party leader Clement Davies said that Churchill's purpose in inviting the Soviet Union was to have a comprehensive discussion of the current world situation. Davies said that this was nothing like the "rigid agenda" proposed in the Washington Communiqué.

Labor MP Gordon Walker said that it was extremely necessary for the major Western powers to convince the world that they truly desired to negotiate. He said: "It is meaningless to agree to negotiate in principle on the one hand, and on the other hand to put forward many unacceptable conditions (these conditions either make negotiations impossible or make negotiations difficult)." He went on to say: "I think that if we are truly willing to restore German unity, one of the most important conditions is that we must stop implementing all our European Defense Group policies when we are preparing to conduct such negotiations with the Russians. If we don't do this, then it means that we are not sincere in wanting to negotiate with the Russians... There are only two explanations for the decisions made by the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference: one is to help Adenauer in the German elections; the other is to completely shatter the hope of successful negotiations in the future, or perhaps both." Labor MP Harold Davies, when talking about the Washington Conference communiqué, said: "Everyone proposes that the Russians participate in the negotiations, but in fact, we don't want to give in even one step. This is not the spirit of negotiation, this is an ultimatum."

Labor Party member Ian Mikardo spoke out against Butler, believing that Churchill's May 11th speech was a manifestation of "a new, truly independent British initiative." He said: "This is the first time that the current British government has not been as dominated by the United States as before. However, the communiqué signed by Acting Foreign Secretary Salisbury last week was a completely pathetic surrender... From all of this, it is not surprising that the Washington communiqué has almost angered the entire British public opinion... The invitation to the Russians in the Washington communiqué was specifically issued to make it impossible to reach an agreement with the Russians."

Mikardo continued that the purpose of the Washington communiqué was obviously to maintain chaos in Asia and Europe, "Salisbury seems to have completely departed from the government's previous position in terms of recognizing Communist China after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. What's more, the three foreign ministers made arrogant guarantees, which will only prolong the war in Indochina indefinitely."

Mikardo concluded that, judging from Dulles's speech in Washington, he was less like the US Secretary of State and more like Adenauer's election agent in the upcoming West German elections.

Former Labor government Deputy Foreign Secretary Younger said he did not believe the Acting Foreign Secretary was able to insist on British views in front of the Americans at the Washington Conference. Younger said the purpose of suggesting a Four-Power Conference was to try and begin solving the problems of establishing mutual understanding and, if possible, some degree of trust, so that agreement could be reached on all fronts in the future. The note to the Soviet government from the Washington Conference was reprehensible, because it was entirely at odds with the Prime Minister's thinking ... It proves that Churchill's policy of wanting a good response from Russia was at odds with American views. Younger concluded by calling for a swift UN General Assembly to discuss Syngman Rhee's obstruction of the Korean armistice.

Deputy Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd denied the differences between the Prime Minister and other government officials. Lloyd defended the government's policies and the resolutions of the Washington Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: TASS Moscow, July 23rd: A "Pravda" correspondent in London reported: British newspapers are commenting on the results of the Washington Conference of the British, French and American foreign ministers. The results of the Washington Conference have been severely criticized not only by newspapers reflecting the views of the Labor Party, but also by newspapers of the Conservative Party. For example, the right-wing newspaper "Daily Mail" said in an editorial that the results of the Washington Conference were "less a British victory and more a British defeat. A trite communiqué written at Dulles's whim did not mention a word of the Four-Power talks advocated by Churchill and the British people." Recently, people from all walks of life in Britain have been increasingly vocally demanding the convening of a Four-Power Conference to solve pressing international problems, and demanding the establishment of normal trade relations between East and West.

The "Pravda" reporter wrote that when the British House of Commons began debating the issue of British foreign policy on July 21st, many voters visited Parliament. They went there to meet with the MPs elected from their constituencies, demanding that Four-Power talks be held and trade with the East be expanded. Voters visited MPs for several hours, many voters made their demands to the MPs, and received assurances from the MPs that they would support their demands. A delegation of voters from Manchester visited some MPs from Manchester, and some Labor MPs promised to do their best to strive for direct talks between the major powers; Conservative MP Robert Cary also expressed his support for holding talks, and advocated expanding trade between East and West, especially trade with China.

### 英国下院举行外交政策辩论  许多议员发言严厉抨击华盛顿三外长会议

    英国下院举行外交政策辩论
    许多议员发言严厉抨击华盛顿三外长会议
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十四日讯：英国下院对代理首相巴特勒二十一日在下院举行外交政策辩论时发表的演说作了有关外交政策问题的讨论。巴特勒阐述了自从五月十一日邱吉尔首相建议召开大国“最高级”代表会议以来英国政府政策的特点。许多发言人都尖锐地指责政府的政策，特别是华盛顿会议上英国代表萨利斯柏利对朝鲜问题、德国问题以及召开大国代表会议问题所采取的立场。发言人一致指出，萨利斯柏利在美国的压力下已放弃了五月十一日邱吉尔的建议，他在华盛顿采取的立场是无助于缓和国际紧张局势的。
    反对党领袖艾德礼在谈到华盛顿会议的决议时说：“我们首先要知道的就是：是不是还有举行‘最高级’谈判的希望，或者是像大家所猜测的那样，将用外长会议来代替这一谈判。”艾德礼说，邱吉尔五月十一日的演说中“主张在最广泛的基础上举行会议，并且试图利用那种他认为（我想，也可以说是我们大家的意见）已提供了使东西方之间的紧张局势有某些缓和的可能的条件。”艾德礼主张在最近与苏联举行最高级谈判。他说，华盛顿会议“并没有使我们在走向和平的道路上有什么进展”。
    艾德礼说，他对大家预测的九月间举行外长会议一事“绝不感到兴趣”。他继续说，如果他们能够在某种具体问题上达成协议，那倒是很好的。但是他并不认为德国的将来就是这样一种问题。艾德礼说，在欧洲以及某种程度上在英国都在担心，恐怕德国重新成为全世界的武装威胁。他接着说，德国问题只有“在未来的和平欧洲计划中”才能得到解决。他说道：“我认为，全世界的人都在期待着有一条新的途径，而我们大家都曾认为这条途径已经有了。”
    艾德礼阐述华盛顿会议发表的白皮书说：“本来就不可能对这些谈判期望很多，而白皮书又带来了失望。……现在已造成这样一种印象：即我们表示了我们的立场，期望苏联也采取这种立场。在远东问题上我也发现了同样情况，就是：我们采取这样一种立场，同时也要对方采取这样的立场。我不认为，这种路线是十分有效的。如果认为其他国家的政府一定会同意的话，那是十分荒谬的。”
    艾德礼最后说：“我希望欧洲东西方之间展开广泛的贸易。我希望与中国进行贸易。我特别希望各国之间的交往。我认为，紧张局势已经有些缓和。如果谈判能够促进我们互相的谅解和保证各国间的交往，那末局势就更有希望了。但是，坦白地说，我并不认为，华盛顿谈判已经使我们在和平道路上有了什么进展。”
    自由党领袖克利门特·戴维斯说，邱吉尔所指的邀请苏联的目的是全盘讨论目前世界的局势。戴维斯说道，这与华盛顿公报上所提议的“硬性的议事日程”毫无相同之处。
    工党议员戈登·华尔克说，对西方各大国说来，极为必要的是要使全世界相信：他们是真正祈望进行谈判的。他说：“要是一方面在原则上同意谈判，而另一方面又提出许多不可能接受的条件（这些条件不是使谈判成为不可能，就是使谈判发生困难），那末这种同意谈判就毫无意义了。”他接着说：“我认为，如果要我们真正愿意恢复德国统一，最主要的条件之一就是在我们准备与俄国人进行这类谈判的时候，必须停止执行一切我们欧洲防务集团方面的政策。如果我们不做到这一点，那就意味着我们不是真心诚意地要与俄国人谈判……三外长会议所作的决定只有两种解释：一种是，希望在德国选举中帮助阿登纳；另一种是，要完全粉碎今后进行顺利谈判的希望，也可能两种都有。”工党议员哈罗德·戴维斯谈到华盛顿会议公报时说：“大家提议要俄国人参加谈判，但是事实上，我们却想一步也不让。这不像是一种谈判的精神，这是最后通牒。”
    工党党员伊安·米卡多发言斥责巴特勒，他认为邱吉尔五月十一号的演说是“新的、真正独立的英国主动”的表现。他说：“这是现任英国政府首次地不像以前那样受美国支配的表现。但是，代理外交大臣萨利斯柏利上周所签字的公报却是一个十足可怜的投降。……由这一切看来，华盛顿公报几乎激怒了英国整个舆论界，这是不足为奇的……华盛顿公报中对俄国人的邀请是专门为了要使得和俄国人不可能达成协议而发出的。”
    米卡多继称，华盛顿公报的目的显然是为了要保持亚洲和欧洲的混乱状态，“萨利斯柏利在朝鲜停战协定签订后承认共产党中国这方面看来已经完全离开了政府以前的立场了。更有甚者，三国外长作出了狂妄的保证，这种保证只会使印度支那的战争无限期地延续下去。”
    米卡多最后说，从杜勒斯在华盛顿的发言看，与其说他是美国的国务卿，还不如说他是在即将到来的西德选举中的阿登纳的选举代办。”
    前工党政府外交副大臣杨格说，他不相信代理外交大臣能够在华盛顿会议中，在美国人前面坚持英国的观点。杨格说，召开四大国会议的建议，目的是试图开始解决建立互相谅解的问题，如果可能的话，在某种程度上解决建立信任的问题，以便在将来能够在各方面取得协议。华盛顿会议给苏联政府的照会是应当受到指责的，因为它完全不符合首相的想法，……事实证明，邱吉尔想在俄国获得良好反应的政策是和美国的观点背道而驰的。杨格最后号召急速召开联合国大会，讨论李承晚阻挠朝鲜停战的行为。
    外交副大臣塞尔温·劳埃德否认了首相和其他政府人员之间的分歧。劳埃德为政府的政策和华盛顿会议的决议作了辩护。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：“真理报”驻伦敦记者报道：英国报纸纷纷评论英、法、美三国外长华盛顿会议的结果。华盛顿会议的结果，不仅受到反映工党意见的报纸的严厉批评，而且受到保守党报纸的严厉批评。例如，右翼报纸“每日邮报”就在社论中说：华盛顿会议的结果，“与其说是英国的胜利，不如说是英国的失败。杜勒斯随心所欲地写出来的一项陈词滥调的公报，没有只字提到邱吉尔和英国人民所主张的四大国会谈”。近来，英国各阶层人民日益大声疾呼地要求召开四大国会议以解决迫切的国际问题，要求建立东西方之间的正常贸易关系。
    “真理报”记者写道，七月二十一日英国议会下院开始进行关于英国外交政策问题的辩论时，有许多选民去访问议会。他们到那里去会见从他们选区中选出的议会议员，他们要求举行四大国会谈，扩大与东方的贸易。选民们访问议员达数小时，许多选民向议员提出了自己的要求，并得到了议员答应支持他们的要求的保证。曼彻斯特的选民代表团访问了曼彻斯特一些议员，一些工党议员答应尽力争取举行大国之间的直接会谈；保守党议员罗伯特·凯里也表示主张举行会谈，主张扩大东西方之间的贸易，特别是与中国的贸易。
