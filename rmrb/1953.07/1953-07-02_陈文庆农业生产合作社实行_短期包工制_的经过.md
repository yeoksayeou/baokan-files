The Chen Wenqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yiliba Village, Tenth District, Longjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, implemented the "short-term contract system" with the help of the county work team when it was established in March this year. However, during the spring plowing and wheat sowing, the "contract system" was basically not implemented. The phenomena of work stoppages and absenteeism within the cooperative were very serious, and the labor enthusiasm of the members was not fully utilized. As a result, wheat that should have been planted in ten days took twenty-one days to complete. Why was the short-term contract system not implemented?

First, the leading cadres and some members of the cooperative did not sufficiently recognize the benefits of implementing the "contract system" and could not immediately abandon the old habits from the mutual aid team era. They believed that the "contract system" was troublesome and not as simple as the "old ten points" or "old eight points." In addition, some members had more serious egalitarian ideas and were not easily accepting the principle of "payment according to work." Some members said, "He is a person, and so am I. He is working, and I am not idle. Why should he earn more points than me?" These people did not agree with contracting.

Second, there was no rational labor organization. In compiling teams and groups, they started purely from the point of view of personal relationships and did not rationally allocate labor and leadership backbone according to production needs, based on differences in skill level and labor strength. As a result, some teams and groups could not undertake a complete production operation. For example, when planting wheat, some groups had three people, but none of them knew how to drive a horse-drawn plow, while other groups were full of people who knew how to drive a horse-drawn plow, but none of them knew how to sow seeds. More problematic was that technicians did not do technical work, and some technicians who used new farm tools were assigned to deliver manure. As a result, when working, the labor force of the contracted teams and groups had to be greatly changed, disrupting the original stability of the production teams.

Third, the quotas were unreasonable when contracting. The main reason was that different work points were not set based on the specific conditions of horsepower strength, personnel skill level, land distance, and plot size, but rather a large-scale equalization method was adopted for contracting. Because the quotas were not set according to the actual situation, some were set too high, and some were set too low. As a result, contracting not only did not play a positive role but also dampened the production enthusiasm of the members.

Fourth, the production plan was disconnected from the contracting. The cooperative had a perennial production plan but no seasonal or short-term plans. When contracting, the leading cadres had no idea, and the members were uncertain. They would contract whatever work was needed at the time. Some work was contracted too late when it was about to be done.

Fifth, there were no necessary systems to ensure the implementation of the contract. First of all, there was no quality inspection system. Some members, in order to earn more points, would skip every other furrow when plowing; when harrowing, they did not care whether the clods of soil were broken up, considering it done after one pass. The cooperative had three party members and four members of the Communist Youth League, but their ideological awareness was very low, and they could not play an ideological leadership role for the general members. Some members believed that the relationship between individuals and the cooperative was like that of a worker and an owner, and therefore they only wanted to take advantage. This is the basic reason why the "short-term contract system" in the cooperative became a mere formality.

After summarizing the above-mentioned experiences and lessons, the work team adopted the following methods and steps to further implement the "short-term contract system" in the cooperative.

First, the work team helped the cooperative summarize the work in the wheat planting stage and calculated the losses caused to the cooperative and its members due to the failure to implement the contract system properly. They allowed the members to discuss the responsibilities of the members and the cooperative leadership for these losses, recognizing that the implementation of the contract system was the key to improving production within the cooperative and was of great benefit to both the cooperative and individual members. After everyone had the above understanding, they immediately carried out criticism and self-criticism. Leading cadres and members checked their incorrect thoughts one after another. This laid the ideological foundation for the smooth implementation of the "contract system."

Second, help everyone to do a good job in the next stage, which is the short-term plan for planting large fields. The method is that the cooperative's board of directors first deliberates, and the members discuss democratically to formulate a plan. Different quality requirements were determined according to the different crops for harrowing and the different crops for flat and wide sowing, and the dates for planting various crops were stipulated, so that the quota and the short-term plan were combined. Afterwards, the contract quota was determined. First, based on previous experience, the specific conditions such as the distance of the land, the size of the plot, and the strength of horsepower were investigated, and the contract quota for each crop was democratically evaluated. Then, the work was divided into sections, and the quota was set according to the level. After the contract quota for the whole work was determined, the small tasks that should be done in this section were laid out, and a contract plan for small tasks was formulated to prevent the phenomenon that the organization was disrupted due to the unplanned small tasks in the past. The small tasks in this stage were 40,000 jin of firewood and one well. Quality requirements, completion dates, and contract points were also set for these two tasks. After the plan quota was completed, the leading cadres had a clear idea in their minds, and the members also felt confident. Some members said, "If we had made a good plan and quota earlier, how could we have done less work?"

Third, reorganize the labor organization according to production needs. Appropriately allocate all the people in the cooperative according to the strength of the labor force and the level of technology, and appropriately allocate the leading backbone. Appropriate consideration was also given to personal willingness in the allocation. The 21 and a half male laborers and 9 female laborers in the cooperative were divided into two production teams: new farm tools and old farm tools. The farm tools, vehicles, and horses were fixed for use and safekeeping. The benefits of doing this are: 1. It can give full play to the effectiveness of new and old farm tools and the creativity of the members. 2. Strengthen everyone's sense of responsibility for keeping farm tools, vehicles, and horses. 3. Lay the foundation for the implementation of a perennial contract system in the future. After the labor organization was fixed, the calculated quotas for various tasks were contracted to the team, and the team then subcontracted the work to the groups. The small tasks such as firewood and well-drilling were also contracted to the two teams separately, which solved the contradiction that the whole work and the small tasks could not be transferred.

Fourth, establish several necessary systems to ensure the implementation of the contract system: 1. In order to improve the attendance rate of the members and overcome the phenomenon of unjustified absenteeism in the past, the system of "no unjustified absenteeism, ask for leave in advance if there is something to do" and that leave must be approved was stipulated. At the same time, a full attendance award system for members was also stipulated. After these systems were stipulated, the labor enthusiasm of the members was encouraged. In the past, no less than ten male and female members of the cooperative were absent from work every day, but now it has been reduced to four or five people. 2. A completion inspection system was stipulated. Inspections were carried out from three aspects: 1. The board of directors is the natural organization for completion inspection. Each member must inspect the work quality of each team and group on time according to the division of labor. 2. Mutual round-robin inspections are carried out within the group. For example, in the planting group, the seeders inspect the plowmen, the rakers inspect the seeders, and the plowmen inspect the rakers again. 3. Mutual inspections among all members. Criticism and self-criticism among members are carried out usually or after a period of work. In this way, problems can be discovered and solved at any time. If the quality requirements are not met, "rework" must be done without reducing points, provided that it does not violate the farming season. If rework is not possible and the loss is large, points will be reduced at the discretion of the members' congress.

After the implementation of the contract system, labor efficiency has been significantly improved. In the past, only five mu of land were harrowed every day, but now it is eight to eight and a half mu every day; in the past, 1.2 qing of land were flat-sown every day, but now it has increased to 2 qing. Therefore, the time for planting large fields has been shortened. It took twelve days to plant large fields before contracting, but it was completed in nine days after contracting.

From the process of Chen Wenqing Agricultural Production Cooperative implementing the short-term contract system, it can be seen that in addition to doing a good job in ideological mobilization and making a meticulous plan for a production stage when promoting "short-term contracting" in a new cooperative, attention must also be paid to two points:

1. Starting from the actual situation that the cooperative's cadres still lack leadership experience and the members are not easily accepting the principle of payment according to work, the requirements cannot be too high at the beginning. The so-called "short-term contracting" mainly refers to the "small-section contracting" of a production stage. Only by starting with the relatively simple and easy-to-implement "small-section contracting" method, and constantly moving from simple to complex and gradually improving according to the gradual enrichment of leadership experience, can the shortcomings of formalism be overcome and the labor force within the cooperative be truly organized more rationally.

2. Pay attention to the accuracy of contracting. This is an important issue in resolving the consistency of the interests of members and the interests of the cooperative. Contracting must be reasonable, and a rough and simple attitude cannot be adopted. Both subjective efforts must be considered, and objective conditions must not be ignored. Therefore, preventing the tendency of setting quotas that are too high or too low is extremely important.

    陈文庆农业生产合作社实行“短期包工制”的经过
    胡万阁
    黑龙江省龙江县十区依力巴村陈文庆农业生产合作社在今年三月建立的时候，就由县工作组帮助实行了“短期包工制”。但在春耕播麦中，“包工制”基本上没有贯彻下去。社内窝工、旷工的现象很严重，社员劳动积极性没有得到充分发挥。因此十天就该种完的小麦，拖长到二十一天。为什么短期包工制没有贯彻下去呢？
    第一，社的领导干部及部分社员对推行“包工制”的好处认识不足，一时丢不掉在互助组时的老习惯。他们认为“包工制”是件麻烦事，不如“老十分”或“老八分”省事。另外，有一部分社员的平均主义思想较严重，不易接受“按劳取酬”的原则。有的社员说：“他是人，我也是人，他干活，我也没呆着，为啥他比我多挣分呢？”这部分人不同意包工。
    第二，没有合理的劳动组织。在编队、编组时，单纯从人合心情这一点出发，没有根据生产需要，把技术高低、劳动强弱不同的劳力和领导骨干作合理配备，以致有的组、队不能担任一个完整的生产作业。如在种小麦时，有的小组三个人，但一个会赶套的也没有，而另一个小组里都是会赶套的人，但没有会点种的人。更成问题的是技术员不做技术工作，有些使用新农具的技术员却被分配送粪去了。这样一来，在作活时，包工后的队与队、组与组的劳动力就不得不来个大变动，结果打乱了原来的生产队的固定性。
    第三，包工时定额不合理。主要是没有按马力的强弱，人员的技术高低，土地的远近，地块大小等具体情况，订出不同的工数，而是采取大均匀的办法包工。因为不按实际情况规定定额，有的订高了，有的订低了，结果包工不但没起到积极作用，反而打击了社员的生产积极性。
    第四，生产计划与包工脱节。这个社有常年生产计划但没有季节的和小段的计划。包工时领导干部心中无数，社员心里也没底，碰到啥活现包啥活。有的活临到要干了就来不及包工了。
    第五，没有保证实现包工的必要制度。首先是没有质量检查制度。有的社员为了多挣分，刨槎子时隔一个刨一个；耙地的不管土块碎不碎，走一遍算完事。该社有党员三名，青年团员四名，觉悟都很低，对一般社员不能起思想上的领导作用。有的社员认为个人与合作社的关系是扛活的和东家的关系，因此净想占便宜。这是该社的“短期包工制”流于形式的基本原因。
    在总结出上述这些经验教训以后，工作组采取了下列方法和步骤，进一步在该社贯彻了“短期包工制”。
    首先，工作组帮助该社总结了种麦阶段的工作，计算出因未搞好包工而造成的社和社员的损失，让社员进行讨论，使大家认识社员和社的领导方面对这些损失应负的责任，认识实行包工制是提高社内生产的关键，对社和社员个人都有很大好处。在大家有了以上的认识后，即开展批评与自我批评，领导干部和社员都纷纷检查了自己的不正确思想。这样就奠定了顺利推行“包工制”的思想基础。
    其次，帮助大家搞好下一阶段即种大田时的短期计划。作法是先由社的理事酝酿，社员民主讨论，订出计划。按照扣搓地的不同作物和平作宽播的不同作物确定了不同的质量要求，又规定了各种作物种完的日期，使定额和短期计划结合起来。以后就进行包工定额。首先根据以前的经验，考查了地远、地近，地块大小，马力强弱等具体情况，民主评定了每件作物的包工定额，然后按活分段，按级定额。整活包工定额确定后，接着摆开这一小段应做的零活，制定零活包工计划，防止过去不计划零活以致打乱组织的现象。这一阶段的零活为搂柴四万斤，打井一眼。这两项活也订出了质量要求、完成日期和应包工分。计划定额作完后，领导干部心中有数了，社员心里也有底了，有的社员说：“早要做好计划和定额，那能少干活呢？”
    第三，根据生产需要，整顿劳动组织。根据劳力强弱，技术高低把全社人员适当配开，领导骨干适当配开；在分配时也适当照顾个人自愿。全社二十一个半男劳动力，九个女劳动力分成新农具、旧农具两个生产队。队下再划小组。农具、车、马固定使用和保管。这样做的好处是：一、可充分发挥新旧农具的效用和社员的创造性。二、加强大家保管农具、车、马的责任心。三、给将来实行常年包工制打下基础。劳动组织固定以后，就把已计算好的各种活计定额包给队，队内再按组分工。搂柴、打井等零活也分别包给两队，这就解决了整活与零活调动不开的矛盾。
    第四，建立保证实现包工制的几项必要制度：一、为了提高社员的出勤率，克服过去无故误工的现象，规定了“无故不得误工、有事先请假”及请假必须经过批准的制度。同时又规定了社员满勤奖励制度。规定了这些制度以后，鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性，全社过去误工的男女社员每天不下十余人，现在已减少到四、五人。二、规定了收工检查制。从三方面来进行检查：1．理事会是收工检查的当然组织，每个委员必须按时分工检查每队、组的工作质量。2．组内进行互相巡回检查。例如，在种地组内，点种的检查扶犁的，扶拉子的检查点种的，扶犁的再检查扶拉子的。3．全体社员之间互相检查。在平时或作完一段活后，开展社员之间的批评与自我批评。这样就做到了随时发现问题随时解决问题。凡达不到质量要求的，在不违反农时的条件下必须“返工”，但不减分。如已不能返工而损失又大的，经社员大会通过酌情减分。
    包工制贯彻以后劳动效率显著提高。过去扣地每天只扣五亩，现在每天扣八亩到八亩半；过去每天平播一垧二，现在提高到二垧。因此，整个种大田的时间缩短了。未包工前要十二天时间才能种完大田，包工后九天即完成了。
    从陈文庆农业生产合作社实行短期包工制的过程中，可以看出在新社推行“短期包工”，除了必须作好思想发动工作，作好一个生产阶段的周密计划以外，还必须注意两点：
    一、要从社内干部还缺乏领导经验、社员对按劳取酬的原则还不易接受的实际情况出发，一开始不能要求过高。所谓“短期包工”主要是指一个生产阶段的“小段包工”。只有从比较简单易行的“小段包工”办法入手，根据领导经验的逐渐丰富而不断由简到繁，逐步提高，才能克服形式主义的毛病，真正把社内的劳力较合理地组织起来。
    二、要注意包工的准确性，这是解决社员利益与社内利益的一致性的重要问题。包工必须合理，不能采取粗糙简单的态度，既要考虑主观努力，又不能忽视客观条件，因此，防止确定定额过高过低的偏向是极为重要的。
