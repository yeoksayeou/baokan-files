(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 8th) The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations issued the following communique on July 8th:

    At the liaison officers' meeting on July 8th, our chief liaison officer was instructed to hand over to the other side's chief liaison officer a letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to General Clark, Commander of the United Nations Command, for transmission. The full text of the letter is as follows:

    To General Clark, Commander of the United Nations Command:

    In your reply of June 29, 1953, you acknowledged that the incident of the Rhee Syngman clique coercing Korean People's Army prisoners of war to leave the prisoner-of-war camps and forcibly detaining them was a serious and unfortunate event, which is correct; however, your explanation and handling of this incident are unsatisfactory.

    All obvious facts prove that the United Nations Command cannot completely shirk its responsibility for this incident. The South Korean government and army had expressed their conspiracy for this incident long ago, which you were aware of, but you did not take any preventive measures. After the incident occurred, not only did you fail to impose any effective sanctions against the South Korean security forces under the control of the United Nations Command for their acts of sabotage of the prisoner-of-war agreement by coercing prisoners of war to leave the camps, but after we sent a letter on June 19th requesting you to pay full attention, you still allowed the South Korean security forces to continue coercing prisoners of war to leave the camps, so that the total number of prisoners of war forcibly detained by the Rhee Syngman clique reached more than 27,000, including more than 50 prisoners of war from the Chinese People's Volunteers. In your chief representative General Harrison's letter of June 18th and your reply of June 29th, you both stated that you were making efforts to recover the "escaped" prisoners of war, but at the same time, you said that it was impossible to recover all of these prisoners of war. In fact, your military police were ordered not to interfere with any "escaping" prisoners of war, allowing them to be forcibly reported to Rhee Syngman's military training centers. The attitude taken by the United Nations Command during this period, at least in fact, condoned the Rhee Syngman clique's brazen activities in sabotaging the armistice agreement and hindering the realization of the armistice.

    Your attempt to compare our humanitarian act of releasing prisoners of war on the battlefield before the armistice negotiations with the destructive act of the South Korean security forces coercing prisoners of war to leave the camps after the signing of the prisoner-of-war agreement is completely inappropriate. You bear full responsibility for recovering all of the "escaped" prisoners of war at all times. It must be warned that the Rhee Syngman clique is still clamoring to continue to "release," that is, forcibly detain, the remaining more than 8,500 Korean People's Army prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, and is colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's agents in an attempt to coerce Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war to leave the prisoner-of-war camps, in order to completely sabotage the prisoner-of-war agreement that both sides have already signed. We believe that you must bear absolute responsibility for this and ensure that such incidents do not happen again.

    You guaranteed in your letter that the United Nations Command will, where necessary, do its utmost to establish military defensive measures to ensure the implementation of the armistice terms, which we believe is necessary; however, you have expressed no certainty about the South Korean government and army's compliance with the armistice agreement reached by the two delegations. Moreover, the Rhee Syngman clique has been clamoring for "unification of Korea by force," which alone is enough to prove where the aggression three years ago came from. Now, if the United Nations Command continues to condone the Rhee Syngman clique and allows it to carry out all kinds of conspiracies that may undermine the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, then even if the Korean armistice agreement is signed, armed aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea can still break out at any time. Therefore, we believe that you must take effective steps to ensure that the South Korean government and army comply with the armistice agreement and all related agreements in order to ensure that the Korean armistice is not undermined.

    In summary, although we are not completely satisfied with your reply, in view of your expressed desire to strive for an early armistice and the guarantees you have provided, we agree that the two delegations should meet regularly to discuss the implementation of the armistice agreement and various preparations before the signing of the armistice agreement. The date of the meeting will be determined by the two chief representatives through liaison officers.

                Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
                General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers
                           July 7, 1953

    Attached: Clark's Letter of June 29th

    To Marshal Kim Il-sung, Commander of the Korean People's Army; General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    The United Nations Command certainly agrees that the escape of approximately 25,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war is a serious event, and unfortunately, it does not help the early armistice that both sides are earnestly striving for. The United Nations Command immediately notified you of the facts regarding the loss of these prisoners of war through General Harrison's letter of June 18, 1953. We feel that you should have received this news as soon as possible. However, in your letter of June 19th, I noticed that you did not accept the reality that we correctly reported to you for some reason, and you made some incorrect statements about the facts. In order to sincerely strive for an early armistice, I will further clarify these facts.

    Although we spontaneously and accurately presented these facts, you still seem to think that the "escape" of prisoners of war is a contradictory term to their "release" under the orders of the Government of the Republic of Korea. As you now clearly know, the fact is that these prisoners of war broke through the prison walls and obstacles and "escaped," and except for those who have been captured, they have all disappeared among the civilians. They were "released" because the Government of the Republic of Korea planned and arranged this escape without the knowledge of the United Nations Command and against the intentions of the United Nations Command, and the security guards of the Republic of Korea army did not make any real efforts to prevent the escape.

    In answering the questions in your letter, I believe you recognize that the armistice we are both seeking is a military armistice between the military commanders of both sides. The United Nations Command is a military command; contrary to the opinions expressed in your letter of June 19th, it does not exercise power over the Republic of Korea; the Republic of Korea is an independent and sovereign country, and its government is the product of the self-determination of millions of people in that country. The army of the Republic of Korea is placed under the control of the United Nations Command by its government in order to more effectively repel armed aggression against the Republic of Korea. I believe you should be clear that due to the commitments made by the Republic of Korea, the United Nations Command does indeed command the army of the Republic of Korea. In this incident, the government violated its commitment and issued orders that I did not know about to certain Korean military units through channels other than the approved military channels, allowing prisoners of war to escape.

    You also asked whether the Korean armistice includes the Republic of Korea represented by President Rhee Syngman; another closely related question indicates that you expect to know what guarantees there are for the implementation of the armistice agreement on the South Korean side. It is necessary to reiterate here: the armistice we are seeking is a military armistice between the commanders of both sides, and it involves the troops that the commanders of both sides can use. The fact that certain provisions in the armistice agreement require the cooperation of the authorities of the Republic of Korea is recognized. It is hereby assured to you that the United Nations Command and the governments of the countries concerned will make every effort to obtain the cooperation of the Government of the Republic of Korea. Where necessary, the United Nations Command will do its utmost to establish military defensive measures to ensure that the terms of the armistice are complied with. Our willingness to do so should be obvious to you, because we have agreed to those parts of the "terms of reference" that require the United Nations Command to take certain actions to ensure the safety of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its personnel.

    It is regrettable that you have claimed that the United Nations Command condoned the escape of prisoners of war. In addition to being contrary to the obvious facts, this accusation tends to hinder rather than promote the armistice agreement. The United Nations Command is continuing its efforts to recover the escaped prisoners of war. But to say that a considerable number of these prisoners of war can be recovered would be unrealistic and misleading, because they have disappeared among the residents, and these residents are willing to shelter and protect them. You undoubtedly recognize that it is as impossible for us to recover all of these prisoners of war as it is for you to recover the 50,000 South Korean prisoners of war you "released" during the course of hostilities. You certainly understand that the cessation of hostilities will help these escaped Korean prisoners of war return to your side, if they do not object to such return. According to Article 59 of the draft armistice agreement, these escaped prisoners of war, if they wish, can go to your side after the armistice takes effect.

    After the signing of the armistice, the exchange of prisoners of war who wish to be repatriated will include the 12,000 of our personnel that you reported in April 1952, plus other personnel now in your hands who have been captured since that date, and in contrast, there are approximately 74,000 of your personnel, including approximately 69,000 Koreans, now in our hands, and we are prepared to return them to you.

    This letter is a sincere effort by the United Nations Command to enable you to know the facts. It is suggested that the two delegations meet immediately to exchange information on the time that each component of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission can prepare for, so that the effective date of the armistice can be determined, and upon receipt of that information, the armistice agreement reached by our respective delegations can be signed immediately.

                        General Mark Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command
                                           June 29, 1953
                                       At the Headquarters of the United Nations Command

    金日成元帅和彭德怀将军函复克拉克
    同意商谈有关停战协定的实施问题
    【新华社开城八日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团七月八日发表公报如下：
    七月八日双方联络官会议上，我方首席联络官奉命将朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅与中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军致联合国军总司令克拉克将军的函件一封交对方首席联络官转达。该函件的全文如下：联合国军总司令克拉克将军：
    你在一九五三年六月二十九日复信中，承认了李承晚集团胁迫朝鲜人民军被俘人员离开战俘营并强迫扣留他们是一个严重而不幸的事件，这是对的；但你对于这一事件的解释和处理，是不能令人满意的。
    一切昭彰的事实都证明联合国军是不能完全推卸对于这次事件的责任的。南朝鲜政府和军队对于这次事件的预谋，早有表示，你方是知道的，但你方并未采取任何预防措施。事件发生后，你方不仅对于在联合国军控制下的南朝鲜保安部队胁迫战俘离营的破坏战俘协议的行为未给以任何有效制裁，而且在我方六月十九日去信提请你方应充分注意之后，你们仍然听任南朝鲜保安部队继续胁迫战俘离营，使李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘的总数直达到两万七千余名，其中并包括有中国人民志愿军被俘人员五十余名。在你方首席代表哈利逊将军六月十八日来信和你的六月二十九日复信中，均表示正在努力追回“在逃”的战俘，但你同时又说，要把这些战俘全部追回，是不可能的。实际上，你方的宪兵却奉命不得干涉任何“逃跑”的战俘，听凭他们被强迫到李承晚的军事训练中心去报到。联合国军这一期间所采取的态度，至少在事实上是纵容了李承晚集团放肆地进行其破坏停战协议和阻挠停战实现的活动。
    你方企图将我方于停战谈判前在战场上释放战俘的人道行为与南朝鲜保安部队在战俘协议签订后胁迫战俘离营的破坏行为相比拟，这是完全不适当的。你方对于这次“在逃”的战俘，在任何时候，都负有全部追回的责任。必须提出警告：李承晚集团现在还在叫嚣要继续“释放”亦即强迫扣留剩余的八千五百多不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，并正在勾结蒋介石特务企图胁迫中国人民志愿军被俘人员离开战俘营，以图彻底破坏双方已经签订的战俘协议。我们认为，你方对此，必须负起绝对责任，保证这类事件不再发生。
    你来信保证，联合国军在必要处将尽其所能建立军事上的防卫措施，以保证停战条款的实施，我们认为，这是必要的；但你方对于南朝鲜政府和军队遵守双方代表团所达成的停战协定的保证，表示尚无确实把握。而且李承晚集团一直还在叫嚣“武力统一朝鲜”，单就这一点论，已足证明三年前的侵略究竟来自何方。现在，联合国军如果继续纵容李承晚集团，并容许其进行破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的可能性的种种预谋，则即使朝鲜停战协定签了字，对于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的武装侵略仍然随时可以爆发。因此，我方认为，你方对于南朝鲜政府和军队在遵守停战协定及其一切有关协议上必须采取有效步骤，方能保证朝鲜停战不受破坏。
    综上所述，虽然我方对于你方的答复不能完全满意，但鉴于你方表示了努力达成早日停战的愿望及所提供的保证，我方同意双方代表团定期会晤，商谈有关停战协定的实施问题以及停战协定签字前的各种准备工作。会晤日期将由双方首席代表经过联络官商定。
                朝鲜人民军最高司令官元帅金日成
                中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
                   一九五三年七月七日
    附：克拉克六月二十九日的来信朝鲜人民军司令官金日成元帅：中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军：
    联合国军当然同意，约两万五千名朝鲜人民军被俘人员的逃亡是一个严重的事件，并且不幸得很，对于双方热诚争取的早日停战也无助益。联合国军通过哈利逊将军一九五三年六月十八日的函件，立即将关于损失了这些战俘的事实通知了你们。我们觉得你们应该尽早地得到这一消息。然而，在你们六月十九日的来信中，我注意到你们为了某些理由并未接受我们所正确向你们报告的现实情况，你们且对事实作了若干不正确的说法。为了真诚地努力于达成早日的停战，我将进一步澄清这些事实。
    虽然我们自动地与准确地提出了这些事实，你们似乎仍然认为战俘的“逃亡”与他们在大韩民国政府命令下的“释放”是矛盾之词。正如你们现在已清楚知道的，事实是这些战俘冲破监狱的围墙与障碍物而“逃跑”了，除掉那些已被捕获者外，都已消失在平民中间了。他们是被“释放”的，因为大韩民国政府未经联合国军知悉，并违背联合国军的意图，策划并布置了此次逃越，而大韩民国军的保安警卫并没有作什么真正的努力以阻止逃跑。
    在回答你们来信中所问的问题时，我相信你们认识到我们双方寻求的停战是一个双方军事司令官间的军事停战。联合国军是一个军事司令部；和你们六月十九日来信中所表示的意见相反，它并不对大韩民国行使权力；大韩民国是一个独立自主的国家，其政府是该国数以百万计的人民自决的产物。大韩民国军是由其政府置于联合国军的控制之下的，以便更有效地击退对大韩民国的武装侵略。我相信你们应当清楚知道，由于大韩民国所作的承诺，联合国军的确统率大韩民国军。在这次事件中，该政府违背了其承诺，通过了认可的军事途径以外的途径对某些韩国军部队发布了我所不知的命令，容许战俘逃跑。
    你们又问，朝鲜停战是否包括李承晚总统所代表的大韩民国；另一密切相关的问题表示你们企望知道，对南朝鲜方面而言，停战协定的实施有何保证。在这里有必要重申：我们所寻求的停战是双方司令官之间的军事停战，并涉及双方司令官所能以使用的部队。停战协定中某些规定需要大韩民国当局的合作，这一事实是被认识到的。兹向你们保证：联合国军与利害相关的各国政府将尽一切努力以取得大韩民国政府的合作。遇有必要之处，联合国军将尽其所能建立军事上的防卫措施，以保证停战条款将被遵守。我们之愿意这样作，对你们应该是明显的，因为我们已经同意了“职权范围”中要求联合国军采取某些行动以保证中立国遣返委员会与其人员的安全的那些部分。
    令人惋惜的是，你们竟声称联合国军纵容了战俘之逃亡。除了与昭彰的事实相反以外，这种非难是趋于阻碍，而非促成停战协定的。联合国军正继续努力以追回已逃亡的战俘。但如谓这些战俘可以追回相当的数目，则会是不现实的，而且会引起误解的，因为他们已经消失在居民中，而这些居民是有意庇护与保护他们的。你们毫无疑问地认识到，对我们来说，要把这些战俘全部追回，和对你们来说，要把你方在敌对行为进行期间所“释放”的五万南朝鲜战俘追回来，是一样地不可能的。你们当然了解，敌对行为的终止将有助于这些逃亡的朝鲜战俘回返你方，如果他们不反对这种回返的话。按照停战协定草案第五十九款的规定，这些逃亡战俘，如果他们愿意的话，可以在停战生效后前往你方。
    停战签字后，那些期望被遣返的战俘的交换将包括你们在一九五二年四月所报道的一万二千名我方人员，加上自该日以来被俘的现在你们手中的其他人员，而与此相对照，则约有七万四千名你方人员，包括约六万九千名朝鲜人，现在我们手中，而我们准备交还你们。
    这封信是联合国军的一种真诚的努力，来使你们得以知晓事实。兹建议双方代表团立即会晤，以交换关于中立国监察委员会每一组成部分能以准备工作的时间的材料，以使停战的生效日期得以确定，并且在接到那项材料时，由我们双方各自的代表团所达成的停战协定得以即行签字。
                        联合国军总司令美国陆军上将
