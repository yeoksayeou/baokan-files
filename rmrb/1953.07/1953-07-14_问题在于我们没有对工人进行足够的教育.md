    The Problem Lies in That We Haven't Adequately Educated the Workers
    Xing Shengfu, Acting Chairman of the Trade Union of Tianjin State-Owned Factory 712
    I believe that the occurrence of Comrade Wang Xiuzhen's erroneous thinking is, of course, primarily due to her own insufficient awareness, failing to recognize the workers' class's grand future and significant responsibilities. However, the factory leadership should also bear a significant responsibility.
    Take our factory as an example. We also have workers like Comrade Wang Xiuzhen, and the situation has become quite serious. Our factory leadership is not unaware of these lax labor discipline phenomena, but some people in the past believed that this was not a significant problem; others felt helpless and simply turned a blind eye. In short, they did not seriously take responsibility for this issue.
    As for our trade union, we had never thoroughly studied this problem before. We failed to recognize that the trade union is a "school of communism," and we did not pay close enough attention to the political and ideological education of the workers in ordinary times. Trade union group life became a mere formality, and since the "Three-Anti" campaign, we have rarely held group life self-criticism meetings. The enthusiasm for welfare within the groups was very high, inquiring everywhere about buying cheap goods. Some workers bought this and that, and by the time they received their salaries, their wages were completely deducted, and they had no way to live, so they applied to the trade union for relief funds. I was busy with these matters all day long, while blindly believing that those who did not abide by labor discipline were only isolated cases, not of great consequence. Sometimes, although I would talk to individual workers once or twice, if it had no effect, I felt there was nothing I could do and had to leave it alone. The workshop trade union cadres were the same, unwilling to manage these matters. Some workers took unauthorized days off, and when the trade union group leader found out, they would say, "The administration has already approved the leave, what can we say!"
    Similarly, I feel that our factory's Party and Youth League organizations also did not pay enough attention to this work. When giving Party and Youth League classes, they often spoke of general principles, rarely combining them with the specific ideological situation of the workers to study labor discipline issues.
    In terms of administrative leadership, they only believed that they were engaged in production and never inquired about labor discipline issues, nor was there a system of rewards and punishments. For example, Lin Guizhang, Li Xuehan, and Li Jiaqi in the third workshop frequently violated labor discipline, insulted female workers, and hindered production. Many employees expressed dissatisfaction with them and requested administrative action, but it was delayed until many days after the criticism was published in the newspaper before they were dealt with. Particularly serious was that administrative management cadres did not educate workers and dared not manage workers. Some workshop administrators clearly knew that some workers were taking unauthorized leave and absenteeism, but were unwilling to "say too much," fearing "offending people" and being labeled as bureaucrats. When some workers asked him, he would say, "People say they are sick, who dares to stop them? I'm afraid of going to court!" This seriously irresponsible laissez-faire attitude condoned those who disrupted labor discipline. In addition, the emergence of laissez-faire phenomena is also related to the fact that our production management has not been on the right track. For example, in the first workshop, the number of lathes fully operational was rare, often with sixteen or seventeen idle; the third workshop often stopped work waiting for materials, and when workers had nothing to do, they wandered around.
    Through this period of consolidating and strengthening labor discipline, I and other leading cadres of our factory have received a profound education. We realize that it is certainly wrong not to care about the workers' lives and welfare, but it is also wrong to not seriously educate the workers, to turn a blind eye to such serious phenomena as lax labor discipline, and to indulge and tolerate it. We must strengthen ideological education for the few who do not abide by labor discipline, offer positive criticism, and should take necessary actions against individual cases that are very bad and repeatedly unrepentant. In fact, as long as this is done, it will be effective. Li Hongxiang, a painter in our factory, took unauthorized leave and absenteeism for 12.5% of the total working time last year. Recently, after receiving help from various parties, he became aware and reviewed his past mistakes in violating labor discipline. In May, he received a full attendance bonus. Currently, he is also working particularly hard in production, serving as the mutual aid team leader and taking the lead in issuing challenges. In June, their group accepted the task of 600 box sets. The administrative quota was 86 minutes to make one, and they proposed to shorten it by 5 minutes, completing them in 81 minutes. This is the advantage of our working class. As long as the workers understand, their work is truly moving. The problem is that we have not provided them with adequate education in the past.

### 问题在于我们没有对工人进行足够的教育

    问题在于我们没有对工人进行足够的教育
    天津国营七一二厂代理工会主席    邢生福
    我觉得王秀珍同志错误思想的发生，当然主要是因为本身觉悟不高，没有认清工人阶级的远大前途和重大责任；但是在工厂的领导方面来说，却也应负很大的责任。
    就拿我们厂来说，也有像王秀珍同志这样的工人，并且情况发展得很严重。这些劳动纪律松弛的现象，我们厂的领导方面不是不知道，但过去有的人认为这不是什么了不起的问题；也有的人感觉对它没办法，就干脆装个看不见。总之，对待这个问题，没有认真负起自己的责任来。
    拿我们工会来说，以前就从来没有很好地研究过这个问题。我们没有认清工会是“共产主义的学校”，平常对工人的政治思想教育抓得不紧，工会小组生活流于形式，从“三反”运动以后，很少开过小组生活检讨会。小组里搞福利的热情倒很高，到处打听买便宜东西，有的工人买这买那，等发薪的时候工资全扣净了，生活没办法，又向工会申请救济金。我也就整天为这些事乱忙，而对于那些不遵守劳动纪律的人，却盲目地认为只是极个别的，没多大关系；有时虽然也找个别工人谈谈，但是谈一两次没有效果，就觉得没有办法，只好放下不管了。车间工会干部也是一样，不愿意管这些事，有的工人无故歇班，工会小组长知道了，还说：“人家行政都准了假，咱还怎么说！”
    同样，我觉得我们厂党和团的组织对这个工作也重视不够。上党课团课的时候，常常是泛泛地讲道理，很少结合工人的具体思想情况，研究劳动纪律问题。
    在行政领导方面，就只认为自己是搞生产的，对劳动纪律问题从不过问，也没有赏罚制度。像第三车间林桂章、李学汉、李家琪，经常违犯劳动纪律，侮辱女工，妨碍生产，很多职工对他们表示不满，要求行政处理，但一直拖到这次报纸上提出批评后，还隔了很多天才处理。特别严重的是行政管理干部不教育工人，不敢管工人。有的车间管理员明明知道有的工人无故请假歇工，也不愿意“多嘴”，怕“得罪了人”，怕给自己扣上官僚主义的帽子。有的工人问他，他还说：“人家说有病，谁敢拦，我怕进法院！”这种严重不负责任的自由主义的态度，纵容了破坏劳动纪律的人。另外，自由散漫现象的产生，和我们生产管理一直没有走上正轨也有一定的关系，像第一车间的车床，开齐的时候很少，常常有十六七部空闲着；第三车间经常停工待料，工人无事干，就蹓跶蹓跶。
    通过这一时期巩固和加强劳动纪律的工作，我和我们厂的其他领导干部都受到一次深刻的教育。我们认识到：不关心工人的生活福利固然不对，但不认真地教育工人，对类似劳动纪律松弛的这种严重现象熟视无睹，迁就姑息，也是不对的。我们必须对少数不遵守劳动纪律的人，加强思想教育，提出正面的批评，对其中个别情形很坏又屡教不改的，应该加以必要的处理。事实上，只要这样做了，就会有成效。我们厂的漆工李鸿祥，去年全年借故请假歇工占全部工作时间百分之十二点五，近来经过各方面对他的帮助，他觉悟了，检讨了自己过去违犯劳动纪律的错误，五月份他就领到了全勤奖金。目前他在生产上也特别努力，当了互助组长，带头提出挑战。六月份他们小组接受了六百个套箱的任务，行政定额是八十六分钟做一个，他们提出保证要缩短五分钟，八十一分钟交活。这是我们工人阶级的优点。工人只要想通了，干起来真叫人感动。问题就在于我们过去没有向他们进行足够的教育。
