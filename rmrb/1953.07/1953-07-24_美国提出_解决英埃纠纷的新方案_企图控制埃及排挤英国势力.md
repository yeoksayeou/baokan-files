Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The U.S. government is taking advantage of the tense Anglo-Egyptian relations, attempting to control Egypt by "mediating" the Anglo-Egyptian dispute.

    U.S. Ambassador to Cairo, Caffery, delivered a "significant letter" from the U.S. government to the Egyptian government on the 16th, proposing a so-called "new plan to resolve the Anglo-Egyptian dispute." According to Agence France-Presse, the U.S. stated in its "letter" that it would support Egypt, and proposed a plan to send U.S. technicians and British and Egyptian personnel to "jointly maintain" the Suez Canal, and to control Egypt through military and economic "aid." This plan was drafted by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles during his "travels" in Egypt in May.

    The U.S. verbally states that it recognizes Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal Zone; the actual purpose is to exclude British influence in Egypt and replace it. In the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations on the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone, which began at the end of April, Britain demanded that Egypt hire 6,000 British "experts" to manage the military bases in the Suez Canal Zone after the British troops withdrew. This was one of the main reasons why the negotiations were adjourned indefinitely in early May. The U.S. government is attempting to exploit this loophole, intervene in the Suez Canal Zone, and send "technicians" to manage the area, in order to further control and occupy it through so-called "aid." In order to achieve this goal, the U.S. is also prepared to once again play the role of "mediator" in Egypt that it played in the Anglo-Iranian oil negotiations. United Press International revealed that Caffery is currently engaged in intense behind-the-scenes activities in Cairo, planning Anglo-Egyptian negotiations based on the "Dulles Plan," and has already submitted the "Dulles Plan" to the Egyptian Revolutionary Guidance Committee for discussion. Obviously, because the "Dulles Plan" harbors ulterior motives, the U.S. is keeping its "details" secret.

    Britain is fiercely resisting the U.S.'s intensified plot to invade Egypt and squeeze out British influence. British Acting Prime Minister Butler declared in the House of Commons on the 21st, during a debate on foreign policy, that he would maintain a "firm" attitude towards the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations. British officials told a United Press International reporter: "Churchill will stick to his opinion on the Suez Canal Zone issue in the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and will not budge. If the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations resume, Churchill wants them to proceed on the previous basis."
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 19th, TASS dispatch: The British Middle East Command announced on the 16th that it had canceled the order to search Egyptians in Ismailia. However, an official communiqué issued by the Egyptian National Guidance Department stated that British troops in Ismailia continue to carry out searches and commit atrocities.

    The Egyptian communiqué pointed out that British troops looted Egyptians during the searches. On the 16th, British troops attacked three Egyptian workers and stabbed them with knives. On the 17th, an Egyptian named Abdel Moneim was seriously injured by British troops.

### 美国提出“解决英埃纠纷的新方案”  企图控制埃及排挤英国势力

    美国提出“解决英埃纠纷的新方案”
    企图控制埃及排挤英国势力
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国政府正在利用英埃关系紧张的局势，力图通过“调停”英埃纠纷来达到控制埃及的目的。
    美国驻开罗大使卡弗里在十六日将美国政府的“重要信件”一封递交给埃及政府，提出了一个所谓“解决英埃纠纷的新方案”。据法新社透露：美国在它的“信件”中表示要支持埃及，同时提出了一个计划，要派美国技术人员和英国、埃及人员“共同保养”苏彝士运河，并且通过军事“援助”和经济“援助”来控制埃及。这个计划是美国国务卿杜勒斯在五月间“旅行”埃及期间就已经起草了的。
    美国口头上说要承认埃及在苏彝士运河区的主权；实际的目的是要排挤英国在埃及的势力，并且取而代之。在从四月底开始的关于撤退苏彝士运河区英国驻军问题的英埃谈判中，英国要求在英军撤退后埃及雇用六千名保管苏彝士运河区军事基地的英国“专家”，这是使谈判在五月初宣告无限期休会的主要原因之一。美国政府就企图钻这个空子，插手到苏彝士运河区，派遣“技术人员”管理这一地区，以便进一步通过所谓“援助”加以控制和占领。为了达到这一目的，美国还准备在埃及再一次扮演它曾经在干涉英伊石油谈判时所演过的“调停人”角色。合众社透露：卡弗里目前正在开罗作紧张的幕后活动，策划一个以“杜勒斯计划”作谈判基础的英埃谈判，并且已经把“杜勒斯计划”交给埃及当局的革命指导委员会讨论。显然由于“杜勒斯计划”包藏着不可告人的野心，美国对它的“细节”还保守秘密。
    英国对于美国加紧侵入埃及以排挤英国势力的阴谋活动，正在作激烈的抵抗。英国代理首相巴特勒二十一日在下议院辩论外交政策时宣称：对英埃谈判将保持“坚决”态度。英国官员对美国合众社记者表示：“邱吉尔在英埃谈判关于苏彝士运河区问题上要坚持他的意见，一动也不动。假如英埃谈判恢复，邱吉尔要他们按照以前的基础进行。”
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社开罗十九日讯：英国驻中东军司令部在十六日宣布取消关于在伊士美利亚搜查埃及人的命令。但是埃及国家指导部发表的正式公报说，伊士美利亚的英军仍然继续实行搜查和制造暴行。
    埃及公报指出，英军在搜查时，劫掠了埃及人。英军在十六日曾攻击三个埃及工人并用刀子刺他们。十七日，一个叫做阿布代尔·摩尼姆的埃及人被英军攻击受重伤。
