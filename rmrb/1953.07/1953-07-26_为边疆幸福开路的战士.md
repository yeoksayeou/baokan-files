A Soldier Paving the Way for Happiness in the Borderlands

Zhao Zhongxin

I.

April 24th, the sky was as clear as the sea, without a single cloud for thousands of miles. This was a rare good weather on the Kangzang Plateau.

The spring sunshine shone on the peaks of the Mila Mountain and on the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army road-building troops working hard here. Some were wielding sledgehammers on steep slopes, drilling holes with ropes tied around their waists; others were prying stones with "heave-ho, heave-ho." At noon, while everyone was resting, the blasters responsible for blasting the mountain lit the fuses for the explosives. One minute, two minutes, three minutes... the blasters accurately calculated the time and hurried to a place of cover. As soon as they stood still, a rumbling explosion sounded, and clouds of smoke, carrying rocks, flew into the sky, the people staring at these flying stones. The large ones fell down immediately; the small ones flew up for a long time before falling down like a flock of wounded crows, some falling on the hillside, some falling all the way into the Lancang River at the foot of the mountain, splashing a burst of white waves.

Soon, the work started again. Young soldier Li Xuewen was painstakingly prying stones on a cliff with his comrades when the deputy platoon leader ran over to him and said, "The battalion headquarters called and asked you to go back quickly!" Li Xuewen was puzzled, so he untied the rope around his waist, patted the dust off his body, and hurried down the mountain. At the entrance of the battalion headquarters tent, he met the messenger Xu Dingcong, who grinned at Li Xuewen and stuck out his thumb, saying, "Li Xuewen, your 'ya mo ya mo'!" (Tibetan for: glory). Li Xuewen still couldn't figure out what was going on, he just said shyly, "My 'bu ya mo ya mo,' everyone 'ya mo ya mo'!" Xu Dingcong immediately took Li Xuewen's hand to the tent to see the instructor. The instructor saw Li Xuewen, his face beaming with a smile, and said, "The regimental political office just called to notify you that you will represent the road-building troops of Kangzang to attend the National Youth Congress in Beijing. Maybe you can even see Chairman Mao. How glorious!"

Before the instructor finished speaking, Li Xuewen's heart was pounding, and he felt a fever on his face. Going to Beijing and seeing Chairman Mao was the greatest wish and the greatest glory of every soldier in the road-building troops. Li Xuewen was no exception. But at this moment, he suddenly felt uneasy. He seemed to feel that he did not deserve such great glory. He was too excited to speak for a moment. After a while, he said very unnaturally: "Instructor, I will never forget the cultivation and education the Party and the superiors have given me, and I will never forget the encouragement and help the comrades have given me. This is the glory of the Party, the glory of all comrades."

In the evening, after work, the news that Li Xuewen was going to Beijing for a meeting immediately spread throughout the battalion. The soldiers cheered and jumped to see Li Xuewen. The front of Li Xuewen's tent was crowded. One group left, and another group came. Everyone wanted to say a few words to Li Xuewen, expressing their love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and their determination to overcome any difficulties and build the road to Lhasa.

II.

Everyone in the regiment knows about Li Xuewen. Since this road-building unit came to the foot of the Que'er Mountain, more than 5,000 meters above sea level, in October 1951, in which tense labor was he not present! In which difficult test was he not present! On the Que'er Mountain, where the mountains were covered by heavy snow, the air was thin, and the temperature dropped to minus 30 degrees Celsius, Li Xuewen, who was swollen all over and his eyes squeezed into two slits, still refused to rest and insisted on opening the mountain; Li Xuewen was the one who led several comrades, stepping through knee-deep snow, falling and getting up again, rolling like snowmen, climbing to a mountain five or six hundred meters high to find stones, and finally completed the urgent filling of the collapse task; Li Xuewen was also the one who insisted on snow sweeping for two months on the snow line at minus 40 degrees Celsius to protect the roadbed and ensure the food supply. This task was really arduous! The comrades went up the mountain early in the morning and didn't come back until it was pitch black. Their clothes, shoes, and socks were wet, frozen hard, and they shivered when they put them on in the morning. It was during this arduous task that Li Xuewen did something for many consecutive nights that everyone would never forget.

One night, Li Xuewen was lying in his tent thinking about how to reduce the suffering of the comrades from the cold? At this time, he remembered the scene of the company commander and instructor, in the howling cold wind, wearing raincoats and holding flashlights, going to cover him with quilts in the middle of the night; he remembered that one night, when he coughed and couldn't breathe, and wanted to drink a sip of hot water to moisten his throat, the Communist Party member Deputy Platoon Leader Yao, holding a tank of boiled snow water, delivered it to him. He also remembered the scene of model youth league member Yang Maowu lighting a night fire on the Erlang Mountain of the Kangzang Plateau to bake clothes for the whole team. Thinking of these things, he couldn't sleep anymore. He quietly got up, saw everyone sleeping so sweetly, covered the comrades with his just warmed quilt, and then, found dry branches outside the tent and lit a bonfire to dry everyone's clothes and shoes one by one. At dawn, the comrades wore their clothes and shoes and no longer shivered, one by one showing grateful smiles. This smile made Li Xuewen feel great comfort.

Opening up the Jia Pila Mountain and the Da Ma La Mountain was the key to opening up the highway from Mani Gango grassland to Changdu. At this time, winter was approaching, and heavy snow fell for more than ten consecutive days. The sky cleared and the sun came out, and the mountain snow melted, and suddenly flash floods broke out. The water was unusually fierce, and on the towering cliffs, torrents swirled with square stones rolling down the valley, and the water level in the stream valley rose sharply. The roadbed painstakingly opened by the comrades was in danger of being submerged and destroyed by the flood. The soldiers were nervously moving stones and building stone walls along the road. However, the flood was getting bigger and bigger, and building stone walls was not a fundamental way to prevent floods. At this time, Li Xuewen was observing and thinking, and suddenly he found that the reason why the flood could not recede was that the stones pushed down when the road was cut blocked the water outlet. Only by prying open the stones blocking the water outlet can the safety of the roadbed be guaranteed. The company commander immediately adopted Li Xuewen's suggestion and directed everyone to rescue. Li Xuewen was the first to jump into the icy flood to move the stones blocking the water. Under his leadership, the entire platoon jumped down bravely. The biting cold current surged around them, and their bodies turned purple with cold, but they clenched their teeth and insisted on working. This highway, which was once almost destroyed, was finally rescued. In this way, Li Xuewen was awarded first-class merit twice, and the superior party committee awarded him the honorary title of Model Youth League Member.

III.

On April 27th, Li Xuewen boarded a car and left Changdu, speeding east along the flat highway they had painstakingly opened up. The car crossed one high mountain after another, one bridge after another. The endless stream of motorcades on the highway ran from east to west and from west to east. Li Xuewen saw that the cars from west to east were loaded with cowhide and sheepskin, which were things that the Tibetans produced but could never sell; the cars from east to west were loaded with tea, salt, and cloth, which were daily necessities that the Tibetans could never get. What he saw along the way made Li Xuewen more and more excited, and he couldn't help but recall the difficult situation when he opened up this highway. From the recollection, he realized more the meaning of creating happiness from hardship, and felt more the joy of enjoying the fruits of labor. Especially when the car passed the places he had personally repaired, he really wanted to jump out of the car several times to touch the road surface there. He had contacted, hammered, and arranged every stone and every square of soil there. When the car traveled to Ganzi, it was already dusk. Li Xuewen looked up and he couldn't believe his eyes. He remembered that not long ago, when he and the troops passed by here, the streets of Ganzi were still deserted. Looking from afar, in addition to the towering lama temple, there were the low bungalows where the Tibetans lived. Today, new buildings stand on both sides of the street, and dazzling electric lights emanate from the buildings. Buses run on the streets. State-owned department stores and People's Banks are open for business, and hospitals and schools have also been opened. Crowds of Tibetan young men and women sing and dance in the streets.

Li Xuewen really wanted to jump out of the car and sing and dance with those Tibetans, and he wanted to tell everyone he met aloud about the changes he had seen. The words that the Party, the League, and the leading comrades often told him, "Our hard work is closely related to the country's economic construction," suddenly became flesh and blood, vividly, as if he had truly understood the meaning of these words. So, the lens of the Soviet film "Sagan's Spring" reappeared in his eyes, and what he said to everyone at a League group meeting, "Sagan's Spring is the future spring of the Kangzang Plateau," rang in his ears again.

At this time, Li Xuewen felt that the car was still running too slowly. He thought, "Car, drive faster! Let us hurry to Beijing, see Chairman Mao as soon as possible, and tell him about the changes in the Kangzang Plateau, and our determination to pave the way for prosperity and happiness in the borderlands!"

    为边疆幸福开路的战士
    赵忠信
    一
    四月二十四日，晴空如海，万里无云，这是康藏高原上稀有的好天气。
    春天的阳光照射着米拉山的群峰，照射着解放军筑路部队在这里紧张劳动的战士们。他们有的腰里系着绳索在陡坡上挥动着铁锤打炮眼；有的在“咳哟、咳哟”地撬石头。天到中午，乘着大家休息的时刻，担任崩山任务的炮手们，把引发炸药的导火索点着了，一分钟、两分钟、三分钟……炮手们准确地计算着时间，匆匆地向隐蔽的地方跑去，刚立下脚，隆隆的爆炸声响起了，山峰上下一团团的烟雾卷着石块，飞向天空，人们盯着这些飞腾起来的石块，那大块的，一下子就掉了下来；小块的，飞上去老半天才像一群受伤的乌鸦似地落下来，有的落在山坡上，有的一直落到山脚下的澜沧江中，溅起
    一片雪白的浪花。
    很快，劳动又开始了，青年战士李学文，正在峭壁上和同志们一起吃力地撬着石块，忽然副排长跑来对他说：“营部里打来电话，要你赶快回去！”李学文一时摸不着头脑，就解开系在腰里的绳索，拍打了几下身上的尘土，匆匆地走下山来。走到营部帐篷门口，迎面碰到了通讯员徐定聪，徐定聪一看见李学文就笑嘻嘻地伸着大拇指说：“李学文，你的呀模呀模！”（藏语：光荣的意思）李学文还是猜不透是什么事，他只是不好意思地说：“我的不呀模呀模，大家呀模呀模！”徐定聪马上拉着李学文的手到帐篷里去见教导员，教导员看到李学文，脸上浮着笑容说：“刚才团政治处打来电话，通知要你代表康藏的筑路部队，到北京去参加全国青年代表会议。也许还能看到毛主席。多么光荣啊！”
    教导员的话还没有说完，李学文的心就扑通扑通跳起来了，只觉得脸上一阵发烧。到北京，见毛主席，这是筑路部队每一个战士的最大心愿，也是最大光荣，李学文自然不能例外，可是在这一瞬间，他突然不安起来，他好像觉得自己不配享受这样大的光荣。他一时激动的说不出话来，停了一会，他才很不自然地说道：“教导员，我永远忘不了党和上级对我的培养和教育，忘不了同志们对我的鼓励和帮助，这是党的光荣，全体同志们的光荣。”
    晚间，收工以后，李学文到北京开会的消息立刻传遍了全营，战士们欢呼着，跳跃着来看李学文，李学文住的帐篷前面一时拥挤不堪，走了一群，又来了一群，人人都想跟李学文说几句话，表示自己对伟大领袖毛主席的敬爱，表示自己一定要克服任何困难，把公路修到拉萨的决心。
    二
    提起李学文，团里谁不知道。自从一九五一年十月这支筑路部队来到海拔五千多公尺的雀儿山下以后，哪一次的紧张劳动中没有他！哪一次的艰苦考验中没有他！在大雪封山、空气稀薄、气温降到零下三十度的雀儿山上，浑身浮肿，眼睛挤成了两条缝，仍然拒绝休息，坚持开山的是李学文；一次带领着几个同志踏着没膝的大雪，跌倒了又爬起来，滚的像雪人一样，攀到五、六百公尺高山上去寻找石块，终于完成了紧急的填塌方任务的是李学文；为了保护路基，保证粮食供应，在零下四十度的雪线上坚持两个月的扫雪任务的也有李学文。这次任务真是艰苦哪！同志们都是大清早上山，天漆黑才回来，衣服鞋袜弄得湿淋淋的，冻的硬帮帮的，一早穿起就冷得直打寒噤，浑身发抖。而就在执行这次艰苦任务中，李学文连续好多晚上做了大家永远也不能忘怀的事。
    一天晚上，李学文躺在帐篷里想，怎样才能使同志们减少点寒冷的痛苦呢？这时，他记起连长和指导员，在寒风呼啸的深夜里，披着雨衣，拿着手电筒，为他去盖被子的情景；记起一天夜里，他咳嗽的喘不过气来，很想喝口热开水湿润下嗓子的时候，共产党员姚副排长，端着烧开了的一缸子雪水，送到了他的跟前的情景。他又记起了模范青年团员杨茂武，在康    藏高原的二郎山上点起夜火为全队同志烤衣服的情景。想到这些，他再也睡不下去了，他轻轻地爬起来，看看大家睡得那样香甜，他把自己刚温暖过来的被子，给同志们盖上，然后，到帐篷外找来干树枝，燃起篝火来，给大家一件一件地把衣服和鞋子烤干。天明时，同志们穿衣穿鞋，再也不打寒噤了，一个个流露出感激的微笑，这微笑，使李学文感到莫大安慰。
    打通甲皮拉山和达马拉山，是打通马尼根戈草原到昌都公路的关键，这时候已迫近冬季，大雪接连下了十几天。天晴日出，山雪融化，突然山洪暴发了。水势异常凶猛，在高耸的峭壁上，激流旋卷着一方大的石块向山谷下滚动，溪谷里的水位急遽上升，同志们辛勤开辟的这段路基，眼看就有被洪水淹没冲毁的危险，战士们紧张地在路沿上搬石头，垒石墙。可是洪水越来越大，垒石墙不是防洪的根本办法。李学文这时观察着，思索着，突然他发现洪水不能退去的原因是：劈路时推下去的石头，把水口堵塞住了。只有撬开堵塞水口的石头，才能保障路基的安全。连长马上采纳了李学文的建议，指挥大家抢救，李学文第一个跳进了冰冷的洪水里去搬堵水的石头，在他的带动下，全排都奋勇地跳了下去，刺骨的寒流在他们周身汹涌，身上冻紫了，但他们咬紧牙关坚持工作，一度险些被冲毁的这条公路，终于被抢救出来了。就这样，李学文曾两次荣立了一等功，上级党委并授予他模范青年团员的光荣称号。
    三
    四月二十七日，李学文乘上汽车，离开昌都，沿着经过他们千辛万苦开辟出来的平坦的公路向东急驰。汽车越过一座座的高山，一座座的桥梁。公路上络绎不绝的汽车队，由东向西，由西往东地奔驰着。李学文看到在从西往东的车上满载着牛皮、羊皮，这是藏民生产的一向卖不出去的东西；由东向西的车上满载着茶叶、食盐和布匹，这是藏民一向得不到的生活必需品。沿途所见，使李学文越来越兴奋，他不由得又回忆起开辟这条公路时的艰难情景。从回忆中他更加体会到从艰苦中创造幸福的意义，更加感觉到享受劳动成果的愉快。尤其是当汽车走过他曾亲自修过的地方时，他有好几次真想跳下车去摸摸那里的路面。这里的每一块石头、每一方土他都接触过，敲打过，安排过。当汽车行至甘孜，已是黄昏时分，李学文抬头一望，他有点不相信自己的眼睛了，他记得不久以前他跟部队路过这里时，甘孜的街道上还是冷冷落落，远远望去，除了高耸的喇嘛寺以外，就是藏民们居住的低矮的平房。而今天一幢幢新盖的楼房矗立在街道两旁，从楼房里放射出耀眼的电灯光芒，公共汽车在街上奔驰。国营百货公司、人民银行在营业，医院和学校也已开办。成群的藏民青年男女在街头上又歌又舞。
    李学文也真想跳下车去和那些藏民们一起歌舞，他又想把自己看到的这种变化向所有他碰到的人高声讲述。党、团和领导同志经常向他讲的“我们的艰苦劳动和国家的经济建设有着密切的关系”这句话，这时突然变的有血有肉，活灵活现了，仿佛他才真正了解了这话的意义。于是，苏联电影“萨根的春天”的镜头又在他的眼前浮现，他在一次团小组会上对大家说的话：“萨根的春天，就是康藏高原未来的春天”，又重新在他的耳边响了起来。
    这时，李学文觉得汽车还走的太慢，他想：“车呀，开的再快些吧！让我们快一点赶到北京，早一点看到毛主席，把康藏高原变化的情形，把我们为边疆繁荣幸福而开路的决心告诉他老人家吧！”（附图片）
