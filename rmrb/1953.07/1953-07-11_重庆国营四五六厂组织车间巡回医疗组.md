Chongqing State-Owned Factory 456 organizes mobile medical teams for workshops, changing the past situation where workers could not get timely treatment.

Chongqing Factory 456 has a hospital, two clinics, and several medical stations. They are all far from the workshops, and it often takes a long time for workers to see a doctor. Workers are afraid of affecting production, so they often endure minor illnesses, which sometimes turn into major illnesses. Taking the fourth workshop as an example, the number of workers suffering from illness is often around 70%, of which about 30% work while sick. In the past, the hospital and administrative leaders did not pay attention to studying this issue, believing that there was no way to solve it.

In early February of this year, the hospital director of the factory, Xu Jinwen, attended a "Health Professional Conference" convened by higher authorities. After listening to the medical work experience reports of medical staff from some factories at the meeting, he clearly realized that the medical work of factories and mines should be production-oriented, serve the workers, and implement the principle of "prevention first, treatment second." After Director Xu Jinwen returned to the factory, he conveyed the advanced work experience to all medical staff in the hospital, organized everyone to conduct in-depth discussions, and decided to change the past working method of waiting for patients to come to them, and instead go deep into the workshops to provide diagnosis and treatment.

At first, because everyone did not understand the production situation in the various workshops in the factory, they copied the experience of others without modification, setting up clinics near the workshops and implementing appointment-based treatment. This method did not work after three days. Because the workshops were too large and the workers were busy with production, they often missed their appointment times. At the same time, workers still had to travel back and forth to make appointments.

In early April, the method of treating workers by work section was adopted, with a clinic set up in each work section to diagnose patients on the spot. Although this method could reduce the time workers spent traveling back and forth, there were too many work sections in the factory to take care of comprehensively, and the order was relatively chaotic. Medical records and prepared medicines could not be delivered to patients in a timely manner.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings, all the medical staff in the hospital jointly conducted research and finally came up with a method of diagnosis called "checking the sick." Nameplates (one side is red and the other is white) are hung in each workshop where employees work. The diagnosis and treatment team compiles medical records according to the nameplates and machine rows. Workers who need to see a doctor turn the nameplate to the red side when they go to work. After the diagnosis and treatment team (consisting of a doctor, a nurse, and a registration clerk) arrives at the workshop, the registration clerk first clears out the medical records according to the red nameplates along the machine rows and hands them to the patients. The doctor then diagnoses the sick workers in sequence along the machine rows. After accumulating a considerable number of prescriptions, the nurse takes them back to the outpatient department to prepare the medicines, and then delivers the medicines to the patients one by one. In this way, workers with minor illnesses can see a doctor without taking a single step, and can get their medicine before they get off work. If the doctor encounters difficult or complicated cases during the diagnosis, they can immediately make an appointment for the patient to go to the workshop clinic for a detailed examination, or the clinic can refer them to the outpatient department or hospital for diagnosis and treatment.

The greatest advantage of this working method is: First, it saves workers time in seeing a doctor. In the past, it took at least one or two hours for workers to see a doctor, but now it only takes a few minutes. At the same time, after the doctors go down to the workshops, they become familiar with the workers' labor situation and work environment, and have a deeper understanding of the patients' conditions. For example, a worker in the fourth workshop often had chest pains, and the patient himself could not figure out the reason. After the doctor went down to the workshop, he found that the reason for the worker's chest pain was prolonged stooping during operation. He suggested that the administration improve the operating conditions in the workshop and explained labor hygiene knowledge to the worker.

Medical staff going deep into the workshops to treat workers greatly encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm and strengthened the relationship between workers and medical staff. Worker Yang Longlin said, "It is something I have never seen before for doctors to come to our lathes to treat us." Whenever doctors appear in the workshop, the workers greet them warmly, saying: "Doctors care about us so much, we must do a good job in production." In the workshop, the doctors were also deeply educated. One doctor said: "The reason why the workers were not satisfied with our work in the past was that we did not do a good job in relieving their pain."

Now, the medical staff of Chongqing State-Owned Factory 456 are actively studying Soviet "labor hygiene" to further develop workshop health care work, in order to implement the principle of "prevention first, treatment second."

    重庆国营四五六厂组织车间巡回医疗组
    重庆国营四五六厂组织车间巡回医疗组，改变了工人过去不能及时治病的状况。
    重庆四五六厂设有医院一所、门诊部两处和医疗站若干处。它们都离车间很远，工人去看一次病，往往要耽误很长的时间。工人怕影响生产，有了一点病往往挺着，因此有的工人就把小病拖成了大病。拿第四车间来做个例子，工人患病人数经常在百分之七十左右，其中带病工作的就占百分之三十。对于这个问题，医院和行政领导方面过去没有注意研究，认为这是没有办法解决的。
    今年二月初，该厂医院院长徐锦文，出席了上级召开的“卫生专业会议”。在会上听了某些工厂的医务工作人员的医务工作经验报告以后，他明确认识到厂矿的医务工作，应面向生产，为工人服务，同时要贯彻“预防为主、治疗为辅”的方针。徐锦文院长回厂以后，即向全院医务人员传达了先进的工作经验，并组织大家深入地进行了讨论，决定改变过去等病人上门的工作方法，深入车间进行诊疗。
    一开始，因为大家不了解厂内各车间的生产情况，曾原封不动地搬用了别人的经验，在车间附近设立诊疗室，实行预约治疗。这种办法不到三天就行不通了。因为车间太大，工人忙着生产，往往错过了预约时间。同时，工人去预约看病时，仍要往来跑路。
    四月初，改用按工段给工人治疗的方法，在每一工段设一诊疗处，就地给病人诊病。这种办法虽然可以使工人减少了来往跑路的时间，但全厂工段太多，不能照顾全面，同时秩序也比较乱，病志和配好的药都不能及时交到病人手里。
    为了克服上述缺点，全院医务人员共同进行了研究，终于想出了“查病号”的诊病方法。在每个车间职工工作的地方，都悬挂名牌（一面是红色的，一面是白色的），诊疗组就按名牌和机器行列编好病志。要看病的工人，上班时把名牌翻到红的一面。诊疗小组（由医生、护士、挂号员各一人组成）到车间后，先由挂号员顺着机器行列按红色名牌将病志清出交给病人，医生则顺着机器行列依次给有病的工人诊断。等处方积累到相当数量以后，由护士带回门诊部配药，然后再依次把药一一送到病人手里。这样，有小病的工人不走一步路就看了病，并且在下班以前都可以吃到药。医生在诊病时倘遇到疑难病症，可立即预约时间叫病人到车间诊疗室去进行详细的检查，或由诊疗室介绍到门诊部和医院去诊治。
    这种工作方法的最大好处是：首先，它节省了工人看病的时间，过去工人看一次病至少需要一两个小时，现在只需要几分钟就行了。同时，医生下车间以后，熟悉了病人的劳动情况和作业环境，对病人病况有了更深的了解。例如，第四车间有一个工人胸口经常发疼，病人自己也弄不清是什么原因。医生下车间后，发现这个工人胸口疼痛的原因是长期弯腰操作，就一面建议行政方面改善车间的操作条件，一面给这个工人讲解了劳动卫生常识。
    医务人员深入车间为工人治病，大大鼓舞了工人的生产热情，密切了工人和医务人员之间的关系。工人杨隆林说：“医生到车床旁边来给我们看病，是从来没有见过的事情。”每当医生在车间出现的时候，工人都亲切地打招呼，说：医生这样关心我们，我们一定搞好生产。在车间里，医生也受到了深刻的教育。有一个医生说：“过去工人之所以不满意我们的工作，就在于我们没有很好地为他们解除疾病痛苦。”
    现在，重庆国营四五六厂的医务人员正在积极学习苏联的“劳动卫生学”，进一步开展车间保健工作，以贯彻“预防为主，治疗为辅”的方针。
