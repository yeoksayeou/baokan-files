    German Communist Party’s "Free People's Newspaper" Welcomes Proposal to Convene an All-German Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Dusseldorf, 19th] German News Agency, Dusseldorf, reported that the German Communist Party's organ, "Free People's Newspaper," published an editorial on the 17th, welcoming the proposal put forward by the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic regarding the convening of an all-German conference with representatives from East and West Germany.
    The editorial pointed out: "Those who genuinely hope for a peaceful agreement on the German question among the major powers must no longer oppose the understanding of the All-German people. Social Democratic Party members and voters will come to the same conclusion. They will agree with Ollenhauer and Mellies that the only reason for delaying the Foreign Ministers' meeting until autumn is due to consideration of Adenauer's difficult position in the election struggle."
    The editorial said: "But the German people have no interest in such considerations. The majority of the people are determined to force this Prime Minister, who advocates war and division, to resign. The German people hope to hold a victorious Four-Power Conference to peacefully resolve the German question. Therefore, the German people advocate giving a positive response to the proposal to convene an All-German conference."

    德共“自由人民报”欢迎召开全德会议建议
    【新华社十九日讯】德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息：德国共产党机关报“自由人民报”十七日发表社论，欢迎德意志民主共和国部长会议所提出的关于召开一个由东德与西德代表参加的全德会议的建议。
    社论指出：“那些真正希望各大国在德国问题上获致和平协议的人们，必须不再反对全德人民的谅解。社会民主党的党员和选民们也将作出同样的结论。他们将同意奥伦豪尔和米利斯的看法，即把外长会议拖延到秋季举行的唯一理由是由于考虑到阿登纳在选举斗争中的困难处境。”
    社论说：“但是德国人民对于这种考虑毫无兴趣。大多数人民决心要迫使这个主张战争和分裂的总理辞职。德国人民希望举行一次胜利的四国会议来和平解决德国问题。因此，德国人民主张对召开全德会议的建议给予积极的答复。”
