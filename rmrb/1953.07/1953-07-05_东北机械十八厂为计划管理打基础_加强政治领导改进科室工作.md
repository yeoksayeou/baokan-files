The Northeast Machinery Factory No. 18 Lays the Foundation for Planned Management
Strengthening Political Leadership and Improving Departmental Work

[Our Newspaper News] In order to strengthen planned management, Northeast Machinery Factory No. 18 has strengthened political work in departments and launched a competition to improve departmental work.

Due to the factory leaders' relaxation of leadership over departments, the political atmosphere in the departments of Machinery Factory No. 18 was weak. Departmental staff had many ideological problems, and their initiative and enthusiasm for work were poor. Departments did not communicate with each other and blamed each other. Many systems, such as production instruction charts, could not be promoted and implemented. Therefore, the factory's situation of production being tight at the beginning and slackening later could not be improved, and the phenomenon of management lagging behind production became increasingly serious.

In May of this year, after starting to strengthen planned management, the leading cadres realized that improving departmental work was imperative, and that the key link to improving departmental work was strengthening political work in the departments to enhance the political responsibility of the departmental staff. In order to find a basis for strengthening political work in the departments, the General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party of Machinery Factory No. 18 cooperated with the departmental branches in conducting investigation and research, and learned that the main ideological situations in the departments were of two types: First, small-circle mentality (departmentalism). This idea was most prevalent among department heads. They only cared about the smooth running of their own department and minimizing trouble, regardless of the needs of other departments and the whole factory, and they shirked responsibility, did not communicate with each other, and blamed each other when things happened. Second, not being at ease with the work. This was most prevalent among staff members. They mainly felt that there was no future in doing departmental work, and complained that the salaries of staff members were low, and that they could earn more as workers; some staff members were also dissatisfied with the bureaucratic style of the department heads and requested to change jobs.

In response to the above situation, the General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party of Machinery Factory No. 18 decided to mobilize all departmental staff to launch criticism and self-criticism to examine the above two erroneous ideas. According to the general branch's plan, the departmental branches first selected the typical cases of the planning department and the wage department shirking responsibility for work-hour quotas, and held an enlarged meeting of the branch to criticize them. At the meeting, many department heads and party members examined their own thinking, realized the serious harm of departmentalism to the interests of the revolution, and expressed their determination to strengthen the system of contact and responsibility and to discuss things when they happened. Subsequently, under the leadership of the branch, each department also examined the idea of not being at ease with the work. For example, among the more than eighty inspectors of the inspection department, most of them were not at ease with their work in the past, but after ideological examination, they were generally able to settle down to work.

After ideological examination, the ideological understanding of the departmental staff was raised a step, and everyone urgently demanded to improve the work. The General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party of Machinery Factory No. 18 promptly put forward the call to launch a competition to improve departmental work, which was warmly endorsed by everyone. However, the departmental staff were still worried that the competition would become a mere formality as in the past, and unanimously demanded that the leadership be able to check the competition in a timely manner, and that the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the Trade Union be able to play a role in the competition. In response to the concerns and demands of the masses, the general branch and the departmental branches immediately took a series of measures: dispatching the chairman of the Trade Union to specifically lead the departmental competition; assigning Party branch committee members to take charge of each department; rectifying the propaganda network, establishing a propaganda group in each department, with Party members and members of the Communist Youth League taking charge under the leadership of the propaganda group, carrying out propaganda and education, and reporting once a week; establishing seven blackboards specifically for departmental use, establishing a "New Method Registration Form," and promptly registering and praising the slightest achievements of the departmental staff; the Trade Union group held meetings every week to check the competition situation; and at the same time, calling on the department heads to rely on the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the Trade Union to carry out their work, and to overcome the tendency of not caring about political work.

Due to the strengthening of political work, the staff enthusiastically launched the competition under the slogan of "Establish new ideas, face the workshop, create new methods, strengthen planned management, and ensure the completion of the second quarter's tasks," and displayed unprecedented enthusiasm and creativity. For example, Zhang Deshi, a wage calculator in the finance department, used to think that the work of issuing wages was strenuous and unrewarding, and was unwilling to do it. During the competition, another comrade in the wage group became ill, leaving only him. Under the education of the Party members, he worked hard on his own and issued the wages on schedule. The head of the administrative management department used to have a bureaucratic style. After the Party branch mobilized him to make a self-criticism within the department, he improved the political atmosphere in the group, strengthened unity, and eight staff members jointly proposed four new methods to improve work within a week. The inspection department organized a typical report meeting. After Wang Mingru, an advanced worker, reported on advanced ideas and working methods, Wang Zhenchun, who used to be passive in his work, immediately took the initiative to help the workers of the grinding surface and headstock group improve their tools and reduce defective products. After the inspection department implemented mobile inspection of intermediate processes in the first mechanical workshop, it overcame the phenomenon of producing a large number of defective products, and the defective products in the first half of June decreased by nine percent compared with the same period in May. The supply and sales department strengthened the division of labor and responsibilities, implemented the supply instruction chart, and actively contacted the production department to formulate a material plan, so that the completeness of materials for new products reached seventy percent.

However, the leading cadres still did not pay enough attention to the leadership of departmental work, and did not regularly supervise and care about the departmental work competition. Therefore, many of the competition conditions set by the departments did not grasp the key issues of strengthening planned management. Secondly, the understanding and resolution of ideological problems was not timely. In addition, the departmental trade unions have not yet played their due role, and therefore cannot make all departmental staff involved in the competition without exception.

    东北机械十八厂为计划管理打基础
    加强政治领导改进科室工作
    【本报讯】东北机械十八厂为加强计划管理，加强了科室政治工作，开展了科室改进工作的竞赛。
    机械十八厂由于工厂领导干部放松对科室的领导，科室的政治空气稀薄，科室工作人员有很多思想问题，工作主动性积极性差，科室之间互不联系、互相埋怨，许多制度如生产指示图表等都不能推广和贯彻，因此，厂内前松后紧的生产情况始终得不到改善，管理落后于生产的现象越来越严重。
    今年五月，开始加强计划管理工作后，领导干部认识到改进科室工作已刻不容缓，并认识到改进科室工作的重要环节是加强科室政治工作，以提高科室工作人员的政治责任感。为了给加强科室政治工作找出根据，中共机械十八厂总支即配合科室支部进行了调查研究工作，了解到科室的主要思想情况有两种：一、小圈子思想（本位主义）。这种思想在科长中最普遍。他们只顾本科工作顺利、少麻烦，不管别的部门和全厂的需要怎样，遇事推脱、互不联系、互相埋怨。二、不安心工作。在职员中最普遍。主要认为干科室工作没有前途，嫌职员的薪资低，不如当工人可多得工资；还有部分职员则不满科长的官僚主义作风，要求调换工作岗位。
    针对以上情况，中共机械十八厂总支决定发动全体科室工作人员展开批评与自我批评，检查以上两种错误思想。科室支部根据总支的计划，首先选择了计划科和工资科对工时定额互相推脱不管、不负责任的典型事例，召开支部扩大会议进行批判。会上，许多科长和党员都检查了自己的思想，认识到本位主义思想对革命利益的严重损害，大家纷纷表示决心，要加强联系制度和责任制度，遇事商量进行。接着，各个科室在支部领导下，又检查了不安心工作的思想。如检查科检查员八十多人，过去大部分工作不安心，经过思想检查后，一般都能安心工作了。
    经过思想检查，科室工作人员的思想认识提高了一步，大家都迫切地要求改进工作。中共机械十八厂总支及时提出了展开科室改进工作的竞赛号召，得到了大家的热烈赞同。但是科室工作人员还顾虑竞赛会和过去一样流于形式，一致要求领导方面对于竞赛能及时检查，党、团、工会在竞赛中能发挥作用。针对群众的顾虑和要求，总支和科室支部立刻采取了一系列措施，派工会主席具体领导科室竞赛；党支部委员分工包干各科室；整顿宣传网，每个科室成立一个宣传组，党团员在宣传组领导下，分工包干，进行宣传教育，每星期汇报一次；建立科室专用的黑板报七块，建立“新办法登记表”，对科室工作人员的点滴成绩，及时登记、表扬；工会小组会每星期开会检查竞赛情况；同时号召科长要依靠党、团、工会进行工作，克服不关心政治工作的倾向。
    由于政治工作的加强，工作人员在“树立新思想，面向车间，创造新办法，加强计划管理，保证完成第二季任务”的口号下热烈地展开竞赛，发挥了前所未有的积极性和创造性。如财务科工资计算员张德仕过去认为发工资工作费力不讨好，不乐意干。竞赛中，工资组另一同志生病，只剩下他一人。在党员同志的教育下，他一人抓紧着干，结果按期发出了工资。行政管理科科长过去有官僚主义作风，这次党支部动员他在科内检讨后，提高了组内政治空气，加强了团结，八个职员在一星期内就联合提出改进工作的新办法四个。检查科组织典型报告会，由先进工作者王明儒报告先进思想和工作方法后，过去工作被动的王振春，就立刻主动帮助研床面和床头组工人改进工具，减少了废品。检查科在第一机械车间实行中间工序游动检查后，克服了大批出废品的现象，使六月上半月的废品比五月同期减少百分之九。供销科加强了分工专责，贯彻供应指示图表，主动联系生产科订出材料计划，使新产品材料成套性达到百分之七十。
    但是，领导干部对科室工作的领导，依然不够重视，对科室工作竞赛没有经常督促和关心。因此许多科室所订竞赛条件，没有抓住加强计划管理的关键问题。其次对了解和解决思想问题也不及时。此外，科室工会也还没有发挥它应起的作用，因而不能使全体科室工作人员毫无例外地都卷入到竞赛中来。
