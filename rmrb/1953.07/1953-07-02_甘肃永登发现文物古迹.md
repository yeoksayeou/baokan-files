    Gansu Yongdeng Discovers Cultural Relics
    While constructing the roadbed for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway within Yongdeng County, Gansu Province, many painted pottery and red pottery jars and bowls from the primitive society period were unearthed. The painted pottery features patterns in the shapes of herringbone, meander, and horizontal stripes. These pottery pieces are approximately three thousand years old and hold significant value for studying the prehistoric culture west of the Yellow River in Gansu Province. Also unearthed within Yongdeng County are over thirty funerary objects, including rope-patterned flat-bottomed gray pottery items like pots, jars, bowls, and stoves, as well as bronze mirrors and hooks, excavated from Han tombs.

    甘肃永登发现文物古迹
    兰新铁路线上永登县境内，在修建铁路路基的时候，在地下挖掘出许多原始社会时期的彩陶与红陶的罐、碗。彩陶的花纹有人字形、回字形、横条纹三种。这些陶器约有三千年的历史，对于研究甘肃省黄河以西的史前文化有很大价值。在永登县境内出土的，还有从汉墓中掘出的绳纹平底的灰陶明器——壶、罐、碗、灶等三十多件，及铜镜、铜钩等器物。
