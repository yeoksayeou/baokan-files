The northeast coal mining industry has greatly accelerated the restoration and construction of mines in the past three years due to the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions. For example, in terms of coal mining industrial infrastructure, Soviet experts helped us improve geological prospecting work, improve geological organizations, and strengthen design organizations. Technically, they taught us how to design new vertical shafts ourselves. In construction, thanks to the introduction of parallel shaft operation methods by Soviet experts, we created a new record of 80.56 meters per month in shaft engineering. In terms of coal mining production methods, Soviet experts introduced new coal mining methods and graded roof management methods, increasing the recovery rate from 49 percent in 1949 to 74 percent in the first quarter of this year. Soviet experts helped us improve coal washing and preparation work, improving the quality of raw coal. Three years of experience have proved that wherever the suggestions of Soviet experts are seriously implemented, new situations and new outlooks emerge.

Currently, the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions can be roughly divided into three types: The first type is suggestions that have obvious and significant implications for current work and can be immediately recognized by employees, and we generally implement these relatively well. For example, in 1951, the Fuxin Open-Pit Coal Mine adopted the suggestion of Soviet expert Comrade Gribkov to change the stripping procedure and increase the amount of stripping, which enabled the mine to produce coal ahead of schedule, and the workload in 1951 exceeded the state plan by 49 percent. Other examples such as the new coal mining method and parallel shaft operation have had great effects immediately after implementation, so the implementation of these suggestions is relatively good and can attract the attention and serious execution of leading cadres. The second type is suggestions that are not currently felt to be needed but are related to long-term construction prospects, and these are generally not well implemented. As early as 1949, Soviet expert Karlkov suggested to a certain mining bureau that it establish a geological organization, do a good job in geological work, collect materials for overall transformation, and put forward ten measures. It was not until this spring that we realized the importance of this suggestion and began a concentrated effort, but the work was already passive and delayed the construction speed. The third type is specific working methods, where we "dislike the trouble" in our thinking and are rough and careless in our implementation, so the implementation is even worse. Soviet experts proposed using live-head drill bits for rock tunneling, which is more efficient, saves materials, and saves effort. During the test, due to poor materials and unfamiliar technology, the fire hardness was insufficient, and it could not be sustained and failed midway.

Our experiences in implementing Soviet expert suggestions are as follows:

First, implementing Soviet expert suggestions is a process of struggle between new and old ideas. If there is a lack of understanding of the important significance of expert suggestions, it will be impossible to implement them. For example, some technicians said: "The Fushun mine is special, with a lot of gas. The problem now is not the speed of tunneling, but whether it 'can be tunneled' or 'cannot be tunneled.'" Therefore, they were unwilling to accept the Soviet expert's suggestion on rapid tunneling. In this stage, leading cadres must make a determination to provide strong support in terms of ideology, organization, materials, and technology.

Second, in the initial stage of implementing certain advanced experiences, their superiority may not be immediately apparent. For example, when starting to operate a coal cutter, the efficiency is low, and some people think it is better to drill more holes and load more explosives; some doubt the high production efficiency of the coal cutter. This is only a temporary phenomenon, not the essence of advanced experience. Therefore, leading cadres must maintain a clear head and resolutely support the promotion of advanced experience, and not allow this temporary phenomenon to become the "basis" and excuse for conservative thinking.

Third, with the implementation of new methods, a series of new problems will inevitably occur, and leading cadres must pay attention to solving them in a timely manner to adapt to the new situation. For example, after the implementation of the cyclical coal mining method, not only did the output increase by one to two times, but the number of accidents was greatly reduced. To adapt to this new situation, it was necessary to change the old design of 52 meters long for each coal mining face to 90 or 120 meters. If leading cadres do not carry out this series of reforms, the promotion of advanced experience will be aborted.

The effect of implementing Soviet expert suggestions is directly related to the level of ideological understanding of leading cadres. Different levels of understanding lead to different results in implementation.

Our leading cadres generally have a spirit of hard work, and with the recovery of the national economy, they have also accumulated some experience. They can generally implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, but due to the lack of theoretical knowledge of economic construction and superficial understanding, in economic construction, some leading cadres lack foresight about the problems that will occur. Therefore, the recognition and acceptance of the suggestions of Soviet experts that have foresight is greatly limited, and the implementation is not firm. In addition, most of our cadres come from rural areas or the military, lack knowledge of natural sciences, and do not understand technology very well, so they do not deeply understand the technical suggestions of experts.

In the process of implementing Soviet expert suggestions, engineering and technical personnel also play an important role. At present, although most technical personnel have recognized that Soviet technology is advanced and sophisticated, this does not mean that there are no problems in actual implementation. Some technical personnel often lack a serious and responsible spirit in implementing Soviet expert suggestions, and are rough and careless, do not seek thorough understanding, and even take things out of context, do not study methods, and do not summarize experience. For example, the deep water-sand filling in a certain open-pit mine seemed to be done according to the expert's suggestion in form, but it was not done according to the method proposed by the expert, and the result was a failed experiment. Later, the experiment was successful under the personal guidance of the expert. For example, when designing a substation, someone casually consulted a Soviet book and started designing it. After the design was completed, the leading cadres did not approve it, and the designers said: "This is the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, why not approve it?" So they went to look for the basis in the book again, and then they found the explanation in the "Note" in the book: it cannot be used when the communication equipment is not complete. There are many similar things that are mechanically applied.

The above situation fully shows that implementing Soviet expert suggestions and promoting advanced experience requires leading personnel and technical personnel to have correct thoughts and attitudes.

So, what is the attitude of the broad masses of workers towards the advanced experience of the Soviet Union? The suggestions of Soviet experts are reforms in production technology, many of which are turning from heavy physical labor to mechanized or semi-mechanized production, so it can widely help workers learn and master modern technology. Therefore, in general, the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions is not greatly hindered among workers. For suggestions that can be successful with one reform, as long as it is explained clearly to the workers, the workers will become supporters and executors of the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions after understanding it. As for the changes involving the workers' operations, after a process of technical operation proficiency, overcoming unfamiliarity and unaccustomedness, the labor production efficiency will inevitably be significantly improved, so the workers will have a leap forward in understanding, and the work will be improved a step.

To implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, the following specific tasks must be done well:

First, complete information must be available. At present, there are two situations in the problem of information: one is the information to solve the current production problems, such as the difficult problems encountered in tunnel excavation, vertical shaft sinking, and mechanical operation. This information is generally easy to find, but there is often a lack of full preparation. The other is information to determine the future planning policy. If these problems cannot be solved, it will affect the work. For example, the expert went to a certain bureau specifically to solve a problem, but due to insufficient preparation of information, he had to first solve the problem of how to collect information. This greatly affected the efficiency of the expert's work.

Second, the translation work must be improved, because translation is the bridge for conveying expert suggestions. Whether the translation is correct or not is an important link in giving play to the role of experts.

At the same time, there is also a situation where no one sorts out the expert suggestions, there is no complete record and archive, and there is no complete system, and no one checks how the implementation is going. This must also be rectified.

Third, technical measures plans must be formulated in a planned and organized manner. For example, in the Fuxin Ping’an vertical shaft, the expert suggested striving for 60 meters per month. At that time, some people said that the target was set too high. After the leading cadres analyzed the current favorable conditions and difficulties, organized a symposium for technical personnel, studied the items one by one, made a decision, made a good measures plan, and established a system, the result was a record of 80.56 meters per month.

Fourth, propaganda and education work must be done well. It is necessary to organize technical personnel to go deep into the groups to explain the technical content and purpose of the expert suggestions, so as to combine technology with the masses and make the expert suggestions mastered by the masses. For example, in order to promote the advanced experience of using long drills to drill deep holes, we mobilized the workers of the Gu Faming group to discuss and put forward specific methods to increase the drill bit head and the air outlet of the wind bag.

Fifth, adopt the method of focusing on demonstration, from point to area, and combining technical theory with actual operation to implement expert suggestions. When Ping’an vertical shaft implemented the suggestion of 60 meters per month, it focused on the advanced banner Gu Faming and his group, and the leaders organized forces to help, and formulated specific plans and completion methods, and the result was a record of 3.5 meters per day. Such in-depth implementation from point to area not only promoted the combination of technical personnel and the masses, but also enriched the practical working ability of technical personnel and improved the technical level of workers.

    东北煤矿在贯彻苏联专家建议工作中的几个问题
    东北煤矿管理局副局长  薛奇
    东北煤矿工业在过去三年中，由于贯彻苏联专家建议的结果，大大加速了矿井的恢复与兴建工作。例如在煤矿工业基本建设方面，苏联专家帮助我们改进地质勘察工作，健全地质机构和加强了设计组织；在技术上教会了我们自己动手设计新型竖井；在施工上，由于苏联专家介绍了竖井平行作业法，使我们在井筒工程中创造了月进八十点五六公尺的新纪录。在煤矿生产方法方面，苏联专家介绍了新采煤方法及分级顶板管理方法，使回采率由一九四九年的百分之四十九，提高到今年第一季度的百分之七十四；苏联专家帮助我们改进了洗煤和选煤工作，提高了原煤的质量。三年来的经验证明：凡是那里认真贯彻了苏联专家建议，那里就出现了新的情况、新的面貌。
    目前我们在贯彻苏联专家建议方面的情况，大致可以分为三种：第一种是对当前工作有明显重大意义的、且能为职工马上认识到的建议，一般的我们贯彻得比较好。如阜新露天煤矿一九五一年采纳了苏联专家格里布阔夫同志的建议，改变了剥离程序，增加了剥离量，因而使该矿提前出煤，一九五一年的工作量超过国家计划百分之四十九。其它如新采煤法、竖井平行作业等，贯彻之后立即收到很大功效，因此这些建议的贯彻都比较好，并能引起领导干部的重视和认真的执行。第二种是目前还不大感觉需要，但有关建设远景的建议，一般是贯彻的不好。苏联专家卡尔克夫远在一九四九年即向某矿务局建议成立地质机构，做好地质工作，为总体改造搜集材料，并提出十项办法。直到今年春天，我们才体会到此建议的重要性，开始突击进行，但工作已处于被动，并推迟了建设速度。第三种是对一些具体的工作方法，我们思想上“嫌麻烦”，做起来粗枝大叶，因此贯彻的情况就更差。苏联专家提出岩山掘进用活头钎子，效率高、省料、省劲，试验中因材料不好与技术不熟，沾火硬度不够，即不能坚持而中途失败。
    我们在贯彻苏联专家建议中几点体会是：
    第一、贯彻苏联专家建议是一个新旧思想斗争的过程，假如对专家建议的重要意义缺乏认识，就无法贯彻它。如某些技术人员说：“抚顺矿特殊，瓦斯大，现在不是掘进的快和慢的问题，而是‘能掘’和‘不能掘’的问题。”因此，他们不愿意接受苏联专家关于快速掘进的建议。在这一阶段中，领导干部必须下定决心，无论在思想上、组织上、物质上、技术上都要给以大力支持。
    第二、某些先进经验执行的初期，其优越性还不能很明显地看出来。如开始操纵截煤机时，效率较低，有人认为不如多打眼、多装药；有的怀疑截煤机的高度生产效率。这只是暂时的现象，而不是先进经验的本质。因此领导干部必须要保持清醒头脑，对于先进经验的推广坚决予以大力支持，不要让这种暂时现象成为保守思想的“根据”和藉口。
    第三、伴随着新方法的执行，必然会发生一系列的新问题，领导干部必须及时注意解决，来适应新的情况。例如施行了周期采煤法后，不仅产量增加了一倍到两倍，而且事故大大减少，为适应这一新情况，不得不把每幅采煤场子面长五十二公尺的旧设计改为九十或一百二十公尺。如果领导干部不进行这一系列的改革，就会使先进经验的推广遭到夭折的命运。
    贯彻苏联专家建议的效果大小，与领导思想认识水平的高低有直接关系。认识程度的不同，贯彻的结果也不同。
    我们的领导干部大都有苦干精神，随着国家经济的恢复，也积累了一些经验，对于苏联专家的建议一般还能贯彻，但由于经济建设的理论知识不多，认识肤浅，在经济建设中，某些领导干部对将要发生的问题缺乏预见性，因此，对苏联专家的具有预见性的建议，在认识上和接受程度上受到很大限制，在贯彻时表现不坚定。另外，我们大部分干部是来自农村或部队，缺乏自然科学知识，不太懂技术，对专家的技术方面的建议领会不深。
    在贯彻苏联专家建议的过程中，工程技术人员也起着重要作用。目前，大多数技术人员虽然已认识了苏联技术是先进的、精湛的，但这不等于在实际贯彻中就没有问题了。有些技术人员在贯彻苏联专家建议中往往缺乏严肃负责精神，表现粗枝大叶，不求甚解，甚至断章取义，不研究方法，不总结经验。如某露天矿深部水砂充填，在形式上似乎是按照专家的建议做了，但没有按专家提出的方法去做，结果试验失败，后经专家亲自指导试验，才获得成功。又如在设计某变电所时，有人草率地参看了一下苏联书籍，就开始设计了，设计成后领导干部不批准，设计人员还说：“这是苏联先进经验呀，为什么不批准？”于是又去查书找根据，这时才发现了书上“附注”中的说明：在通讯设备不完备的情况下不能采用。类似这种生搬硬套的事情很多。
    上述情况充分说明，贯彻苏联专家建议和推广先进经验，要求领导人员和技术人员具有正确的思想和态度。
    那么，广大工人对于苏联先进经验的态度怎样呢？苏联专家的建议是生产技术上的改革，许多都是从笨重的体力劳动转向机械化或半机械化生产，因此它可以广泛的帮助工人学习和掌握近代化技术。所以，一般地说，苏联专家建议的贯彻，在工人中是阻碍不大的。属于一次改革即可成功的建议，只要向工人讲解清楚，工人理解之后就会成为贯彻苏联专家建议的支持者和执行者。至于牵涉到工人操作上的变革，经过一个技术操作熟练过程，克服了生疏和不习惯之后，劳动生产效率就必然有显著提高，因而工人在认识上就会发生一个跃进，工作就会提高一步。
    贯彻苏联专家建议，必须做好以下几件具体工作：
    一、必须具备完整的资料。目前在资料问题上有两种情况：一种是解决当前生产问题的资料，如巷道掘进、竖井井筒开凿、机械运转中发生的疑难问题，这种资料一般是好找的，但往往缺乏充分的准备。另一种是确定未来计划方针的资料。这些问题如果不能解决，就会影响工作。如本来专家去某局是为了专门解决一个问题，但由于资料准备不足，结果他不得不先解决如何搜集资料的问题。这样大大影响了专家的工作效率。
    二、必须提高翻译工作，因为翻译是传达专家建议的桥梁，翻译得正确与否，是发挥专家作用的重要一环。
    同时，目前还存在着专家建议无人整理的情况，没有完整的记录与档案，又没有一套完整的制度，贯彻得怎样，也无人检查，这也是必须加以整顿的。
    三、必须有计划、有组织地订出技术措施方案。如阜新平安竖井，专家建议争取月进六十公尺，当时有人说订得太高，经领导干部分析当前有利条件和困难，组织技术人员座谈会，逐条研究，作出决定，作好措施方案，订出制度，结果创月进八十点五六公尺的纪录。
    四、必须作好宣传教育工作。必须组织技术人员深入小组讲解专家建议的技术内容与目的，作到技术与群众结合，使专家建议为群众所掌握。如为了推广用长钎子打深眼的先进经验，就发动谷发明小组工人讨论，提出具体办法，加大钎子头和风包出风口。
    五、采取重点示范，从点到面的方法，技术理论与实际操作相结合的办法，贯彻专家建议。平安竖井在贯彻月进六十公尺建议时，是以先进旗帜谷发明和他的小组为重点，领导组织力量帮助，订出计划与完成的具体办法，结果达到日进三点五公尺的纪录。这样由点到面地深入贯彻，不但促进了技术人员与群众结合，同时也丰富了技术人员的实际工作能力，提高了工人技术水平。
