Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: News from Moscow: A large number of advanced workers have emerged in various industrial sectors of the Soviet Union. They are constantly creating new labor records and overfulfilling the tasks stipulated by the state plan.

In the steel industry, many steelworkers have achieved remarkable results. In Donbass, steelworker Kosyak of the Stalin Steel Plant over-produced the first thousand heats of steel using the rapid method at the end of June, more than double the total amount of steel produced by all workers in the workshop using the rapid method in the same period last year. Workers at the plant have recently made a guarantee to improve working methods and increase the sturdiness of the steelmaking furnace by 50% to 100%. In Chelyabinsk, workers at a steel furnace in the Chelyabinsk Steel Plant used a new thermal regime and over-produced more than 1,000 tons of steel in one month. In the Caucasus, the Stalin Metallurgical Plant rapidly produced forty heats of steel in the first ten days of June. The group led by advanced worker Ponchulai shortened the planned time for smelting a heat of steel from eleven hours to seven hours and twenty minutes, and increased the steel production per square meter of furnace bottom area from the planned 4.3 tons to 7.3 tons. Advanced workers such as Chekov of the Stalin Red October Steel Plant completed this year's semi-annual plan ahead of schedule after adopting the rapid steelmaking method and over-produced more than 2,000 tons of steel. The Filatoust Metallurgical Plant in the Urals has launched a competition to extend the production period between front and rear repairs. A furnace with an arched roof made of chrome-magnesite bricks, worked by workers such as Staugov of the plant, continuously smelted 672 heats of steel, while generally, such furnaces can rarely continuously smelt 400 heats of steel. This furnace produced continuously for about nine months, extending the period by 50% to 100% more than usual. The furnace can still be used, and Staugov and others guarantee to achieve the unprecedented result of continuous production for one year and smelting 750 heats of steel.

In the coal mining industry, more and more mines are completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In Karaganda, the tunneling team of Khairulin of the No. 64 mine of the "Karagandaugol" Joint Enterprise completed the five-and-a-half-year plan in two years and four and a half months. Recently, all workers of the 17th "Pish" coal mine of the Chistyakovo Coal Industry Joint Enterprise in Donbass completed the July coal mining task ahead of schedule. All coal sections of the mine are mined according to schedule, which has increased labor productivity by 20%. Now, the daily coal output of the mine is 35% higher than the expected level at the end of 1955, with a daily increase of more than 200 tons of coal. Since the beginning of this year, the coal section led by Savchenko has over-produced 12,000 tons of coal. The team of advanced worker Popok of the No. 1-2 mine of the Voroshilovgrad Coal Industry Joint Enterprise completed the Five-Year Plan as early as mid-June. The Ivan Banasenko tunneling team of the enterprise exceeded the quota for pit tunneling speed by about 100% in May, and created a record in June - tunneling a vertical shaft of 41.5 meters. They also guarantee to tunnel more than 50 meters in July.

Soviet oil workers have continuously achieved brilliant results in the nationwide socialist labor competition. In Baku, the advanced worker Kuliev team of the Caspian oil field over-produced 10,000 tons of oil in the first six months of this year. The workers of the "Buzovninyft" Trust generally achieved excellent results. The average monthly drilling speed of each machine in the trust reached 2,499 meters, exceeding the plan by 326 meters. In Krasnodar, the Tokmakov team, which won the title of Excellent Drilling Team, continuously created new records. Last year, the team averaged 2,184 meters of drilling per machine per month, and received awards from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Central Committee of the Oil Workers' Union. In early June this year, the team achieved an astonishing record of averaging 6,852 meters of drilling per machine per month, and drilled an oil well with a depth of 1,147 meters in 120 and a half hours.

Textile workers are launching a competition to fully utilize production potential and conserve resources. From the beginning of this year to the beginning of June, workers at the Moscow Red Hill Textile Factory over-produced 300,000 meters of wool fabrics, of which 60,000 meters were made with saved raw materials and semi-finished products. In the Silk Weaving Joint Factory in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, the raw materials saved by the advanced workers can make thousands of meters of silk fabrics. The factory's employees are launching a competition to over-produce 45,000 meters of silk fabrics and accumulate an additional 600,000 rubles by the end of the year. Workers at the Darnitsa Silk Weaving Joint Factory also made a guarantee to over-produce 700,000 meters of silk fabrics by the end of the year.

    苏联先进工作者不断创造生产新纪录
    超额完成国家计划规定的任务
    【新华社十日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联各工业部门涌现大批先进工作者。他们不断创造劳动新纪录，超额完成国家计划所规定的任务。
    在钢铁工业方面，许多炼钢工人获得了惊人的成就。在顿巴斯，斯大林钢铁厂的炼钢工人科斯雅克，在六月尾超计划炼出了第一千炉用快速方法炼出的钢，比去年同期该车间全体工人用快速炼出的钢的总和还多一倍。该厂工人最近已提出了保证，要改进工作方法，把炼钢炉的坚固性增加半倍到一倍。在车里雅宾斯克，车里雅宾斯克钢铁工厂一个炼钢炉的工人利用新热工制度工作，一个月之内就超过计划炼出了一千多吨钢。在高加索，斯大林冶金工厂六月份头十天中就快速炼了四十炉钢。先进工人庞楚拉伊所领导的小组，把炼一炉钢的计划时间从十一小时缩短到七时二十分，并使每平方公尺炉底面积的产钢量，由计划规定的四点三吨增加到七点三吨。斯大林红十月钢铁厂的先进工人契柯夫等，在采用快速炼钢法以后，提前完成了今年上半年计划，而且超额生产了两千多吨钢。乌拉尔的菲拉陶斯特冶金工厂，已发起了争取延长前后修理之间的生产期限的竞赛。该厂工人斯陶戈夫等工作的一座用铬镁火砖盖弧形炉顶的平炉，连续炼了六百七十二炉钢，而一般用这种炉子是很少能够连续炼出四百炉钢的。这座平炉连续生产了约九个月，比通常延长半倍到一倍。现在平炉还可继续使用，斯陶戈夫等保证要达到连续生产一年，炼钢七百五十炉的空前成绩。
    在采煤工业方面，提前完成第五个五年计划的矿场越来越多。在卡拉干达，“卡拉干达煤业”联合企业第六十四号矿场掘进工人哈伊鲁林的小组，在两年零四个半月的时间内完成了五年半的计划。最近，顿巴斯契斯甲科沃煤业联合企业第十七“彼士”煤坑的全体工作者，提前完成了七月份采煤任务。煤坑的一切煤段都按进度表开采，使得劳动生产率提高了百分之二十。现在，该矿场每昼夜采煤量比预计的一九五五年底的水平还高百分之三十五，每天多产二百多吨煤。沙夫琴科领导的煤段在今年年初以来，已超额生产一万二千吨煤。伏罗希洛夫格勒煤业联合企业第一—二号矿场先进工人波波克的小组，早在六月中旬就完成了五年计划。该企业的伊凡巴纳森科掘进小组，在五月份坑井掘进速度超过定额约一倍，六月份创造了纪录——掘进竖井四十一·五公尺。他们还保证在七月份掘进五十公尺以上。
    苏联石油工人已在全国规模的社会主义劳动竞赛中连续获得光辉成就。在巴库，里海油田的先进工人库利耶夫小组，在今年头六个月中就超过计划多开采了一万吨石油。“布佐夫尼”石油托辣斯的工人普遍获得了优良成绩。该托辣斯每台机器的一月平均钻井速度达二千四百九十九公尺，超过计划三百二十六公尺。在克拉斯诺达，荣膺优秀钻井组称号的托克马科夫小组连续创造新纪录。去年该组平均一月一台机器钻井二千一百八十四公尺，得到了石油工业部和石油工人工会中央委员会的奖励。今年六月初，该组达到了平均一月一台机器钻井六千八百五十二公尺的惊人纪录，在一百二十小时半的时间内钻了一个深达一千一百四十七公尺的油井。
    纺织工人们正在展开充分利用生产潜力和节约的竞赛。莫斯科红岗纺织厂的工人，从今年年初到六月上旬，已超计划生产了三十万公尺的毛织品，其中有六万公尺是用节约的原料和半成品制成的。在乌克兰首都基辅的丝织联合工厂，先进工人们带头节约下来的原料可制丝织品数千公尺。该厂职工正在展开竞赛，争取在年底前超额生产四万五千公尺的丝织品，额外积累六十万卢布。达尔尼茨丝织联合工厂的工人，也提出保证：在年底前超额生产七十万公尺的丝织品。
