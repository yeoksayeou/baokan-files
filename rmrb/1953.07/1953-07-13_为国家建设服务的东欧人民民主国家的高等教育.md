    Higher Education in Eastern European People's Democratic Countries Serving National Construction
    Member of the Cultural and Educational Delegation to Eastern European People's Democratic Countries, Yun Ziqiang
    During the First and Second World Wars, Eastern European countries, due to the deepening of political and economic aggression by Western capitalist countries, were deeply influenced by the capitalist system and bourgeois ideology in terms of culture and education. Intellectuals generally admired the West, despised their own national traditions, and lacked patriotic enthusiasm. When talking about geography, they could discuss cities and ports in England, France, the United States, and Germany, but were not familiar with their own country's geography. When talking about science, they could mention the achievements of Western countries, but not their shortcomings, and they did not value the achievements of their own nation. Because these countries were politically and economically subordinate to Western countries at the time, and because of the inherent unplanned production of capitalist society, the Ministry of Education could not put forward clear goals and plans for education. Higher education mainly became an ornament. University professors chanted the tune of "educational independence," saying that "science has nothing to do with politics." These cosmopolitan and objectivist ideas enveloped the intellectuals of the time, leading to professors lecturing according to their interests, students studying according to their interests, and everyone being unclear about the purpose of teaching. Schools did not hold exams, and there was no fixed time limit for graduation.
    The rule of fascist Germany further deepened the disaster of higher education in Eastern Europe. At that time, all higher education institutions in Poland were closed, and progressive professors were persecuted by the fascists. Various countries also produced some intellectuals poisoned by fascist ideas. Germany itself naturally suffered even more serious poisoning, leaving the Ministry of Education of Democratic Germany with the heavy burden of feeling that "not a single book is usable" after liberation.
    The heroic Soviet army liberated the Eastern European countries, enabling the establishment of people's democratic regimes. These people's democratic countries worked hard to recover from the wounds inflicted by the war. After a few years, around 1948, they embarked on a stage of planned socialist construction. This created the need to cultivate "socialist work cadres" in a planned and large-scale manner. The so-called "socialist work cadres" are people who are proficient in their work and have a high degree of political consciousness. Under the leadership of the parties and governments of various countries, their higher education has undergone planned reforms, moving towards a path that closely cooperates with the needs of national construction.
    The parties and governments of these people's democratic countries foresaw the difficulties that would be encountered in this transformation work, made full preparations, and successfully guided higher education onto the road of cooperation with national construction. A responsible comrade of the Polish Ministry of Higher Education once talked about the need to overcome two basic contradictions in this work: first, the contradiction between the bourgeois thinking of higher education workers and the needs of socialist work; and second, the contradiction between the socialist tasks of higher education and the handicraft production methods of higher education institutions at the time.
    What are the needs of higher education in these people's democratic countries? The need is to cultivate socialist work cadres in a planned and large-scale manner; to promote patriotism; to learn from the Soviet Union; to shorten the length of study while improving the level of teaching; to formulate a unified higher education plan; to establish democratic centralism in the higher education system; and to strengthen labor discipline in schools and determine the determination to strive to complete national tasks, etc. To meet these needs, these countries must launch a struggle against cosmopolitan and objectivist ideas, must unite intellectuals, and reorganize old-style schools to adapt to the new construction requirements.
    In order to overcome the contradiction between the bourgeois thinking of senior intellectuals and the needs of socialist work, Poland spent a year and a half preparing for the "Science Conference" from 1949 to 1951. They started by organizing small-scale seminars in various scientific fields, then organized large-scale conferences in various scientific fields, and further convened a conference of representatives of scientific workers from all over the country—the "Science Conference." During this period, they organized 600 meetings of various sizes (with the participation of 2,700 people), including 150 conferences in various scientific fields. Through these conferences, the government united 500 progressive elements to become the backbone of the movement. In June 1951, the "Science Conference" was convened, with more than 1,000 people attending, representing a total of 60 units. This conference launched a wide-ranging discussion, severely criticized the reactionary idea of "educational independence" among scientific workers, isolated a small number of stubborn elements, united the majority of intellectuals, responded to the government's call to work to complete the tasks of the Six-Year Plan, and aroused a wave of enthusiasm for learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. After the meeting, whether professors made efforts to complete the work plan became a sign of their progress.
    This ideological transformation movement for intellectuals has also been carried out in Czechoslovakia. They first discovered a serious tendency of cosmopolitanism in teaching in the cultural and educational organs of the army, and in early 1952, they convened a national conference of representatives from senior cultural and educational organs and universities in Brno, the second largest city in Czechoslovakia. At the meeting, Zapotocky (then Deputy Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia) and Kopřivský (Minister of Culture and Propaganda of the Czechoslovak government) gave reports criticizing cosmopolitanism and objectivism. After discussion at the meeting, the representatives returned to their original organs to convey the information and launched discussions in their own organs. As a result, a wide-ranging ideological transformation effect was achieved in higher education institutions. Intellectuals began to shift from a style of being detached from reality to demanding to work in coordination with the national construction plan.
    When formulating national construction plans, these countries all put forward the requirement to train a large number of scientific and technical cadres. For example, Poland's Six-Year Plan required the training of 145,000 technical personnel in six years. The old universities, which trained a small number of university students each year, could not cope with the requirements of the new situation. In order to solve the problem that the handicraft production method in higher education could not train socialist work cadres in a planned and large-scale manner, they adjusted the organization of colleges and universities, learned from the Soviet education system, and increased the number of schools, departments, and majors. Originally, due to the traditional power of religion in Europe, universities often had theological seminaries. Secondly, the proportion of university students studying literature and law was also large. In some countries, the church directly controlled many schools. For example, in Hungary, before schools were unified under state management in 1948, 5,327 of the country's 7,971 schools were in the hands of the church. During the university organization reform, theological seminaries were transferred to the church. Institutes of technology, medical schools, agricultural schools, or other departments were often separated from universities to become independent colleges according to the needs of national construction, or new higher education institutions required for construction were established in relevant production areas. For example, Poland merged the shipbuilding departments of various universities into the Shipbuilding Institute, located in Gdańsk. Hungary built the new Rákosi Heavy Industry College, with departments of mining, machinery, and steel, located in the city of Miskolc, where there is a steel plant. Currently, there are 1,800 students. In Czechoslovakia, many new factories were built in the Slovak region, and the Institute of Technology in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, was expanded to include departments of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, architecture, chemistry, and industrial economics, with 4,000 students. Romania adjusted the mining and part of the chemistry departments of the original Bucharest Institute of Technology and established the Institute of Petroleum and Gas in 1948. In the first year, there were only 150 students, but now there are 1,500 students, and it is planned to increase to 4,500 students in the future. It now has four departments: geological survey, oil extraction, oil refining engineering, and engineering equipment. The agricultural college in Plovdiv, the agricultural center of Bulgaria, was originally a department of the university and became an independent college in 1950. It now has three departments: agronomy, horticulture, and food industry, with a total of 1,100 students. The famous German Dresden Higher Technical School had 5,800 students in 1952, plus 2,000 worker-peasant preparatory students, 4,000 correspondence students, and 1,400 faculty and staff, making it a higher education institution with 13,000 people. Other universities, such as Warsaw University and Krakow University in Poland, Humboldt University and Leipzig University in Berlin, Rostock University in Germany, Charles University in Czechoslovakia, Kossuth University in Hungary, and Babeș-Bolyai University in Romania, Sofia University in Bulgaria, etc., have all adjusted their organizations and expanded their enrollment in the same direction of meeting the needs of national construction.
    After the adjustment of higher education institutions, the number of colleges and universities increased, and there were not enough teachers (especially in natural sciences). The remedy was to locate some higher education institutions in the relevant production areas. In this way, industrial and agricultural technical experts could be drawn nearby to serve as lecturers on a part-time basis. For example, Hungary increased the number of lecturers in higher education institutions by 200 by doing so. In addition, in order to meet the ever-increasing need for faculty in higher education institutions, various countries have planned to gradually select outstanding university graduates as graduate students in various teaching and research departments to train them to become university teachers, and have also planned to send students to study in the Soviet Union and fraternal countries.
    In bourgeois countries, universities are places where the children of the bourgeoisie and landlords enjoy education. The pre-liberation Eastern European countries were naturally no exception. For example, in pre-war Poland, 43% of university students were from landlord and bourgeois backgrounds, 30% were children of senior staff, and 14% were children of wealthy peasants. In Germany, before World War II, only 2% of university students were from working-class and peasant backgrounds. In Czechoslovakia, before liberation, only 7% of university students were from working-class and peasant backgrounds. In Hungary, before liberation, 3.5% of university students were from working-class and peasant backgrounds. In Romania, 95% of the student body before the war belonged to the exploiting classes.
    After liberation, the people's democratic regimes, in order to accelerate the training of working-class and peasant youth to become the backbone of national construction, worked hard to open the doors of universities to the working people. The general method was to establish worker-peasant preparatory courses attached to universities. These preparatory courses were often short-term at first, such as half-year cram schools, and gradually extended to two years later.
    The parties and governments of these countries attach great importance to worker-peasant preparatory courses. In order to encourage the children of workers and peasants to enroll, they often stipulate that they should be given more scholarships. For example, Democratic Germany stipulates that children of workers and peasants generally receive a subsidy of 180 marks per month, those with average grades receive 220 marks, and those with excellent grades receive 260 marks. Children of the bourgeoisie with excellent grades can get 130 marks, and only those with the best grades can get 180 marks. Other countries have similar regulations.
    In order to solve the economic difficulties of working-class and peasant children entering school, some scholarships stipulate holiday home expenses, and some countries stipulate that additional subsidies are given for marriage and childbirth. In order to solve their difficulties in food and lodging, "university apartments" and "university canteens" are established. In the early days, in order to encourage the children of workers and peasants to enter university, it was stipulated that those who graduated from worker-peasant preparatory courses could be exempted from the entrance examination. Entrance examinations were not held until the number of working-class and peasant children enrolled in universities reached a certain limit.
    Despite the situation, there were other difficulties in the early days. Some university professors, deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie, often deliberately increased the learning content, making it difficult for working-class and peasant students to digest, and gave difficult problems in the exams, making them unable to pass. For example, in Hungary, this once caused a large number of working-class and peasant students to drop out. Later, in 1950, the Hungarian Working People's Party made a resolution severely criticizing this phenomenon, and this shortcoming was corrected.
    Democratic Germany has always felt considerable difficulty in mobilizing working-class and peasant activists to enter universities until 1948. The reasons are several. First, the individuals only valued existing technology and believed that learning theory was not important. Second, factories were unwilling to release activists in production, fearing that it would affect the production of their units. In addition, the parents of the individuals were unwilling for their children to study in order to receive subsidies for support. These difficulties were gradually overcome only after some people graduated from universities, had higher skills, received higher wages, and with the extensive political work of the Youth League members. In order to overcome the difficulty of the working people being afraid of learning theory, some schools compiled "How to Study," pointing out the necessity of learning theory and the methods of reading in order to cultivate the spirit of overcoming all difficulties in the children of workers and peasants and cultivate their determination to master theory.
    In order to raise workers with five or ten years of work experience to the level of engineers, various countries learned from the Soviet Union and opened two-year courses in universities to raise them to the level of engineers in two years. This possibility is due to the fact that workers with long work experience have accumulated quite rich operational experience in a profession, so they do not need to add many practical courses like ordinary university students during their studies, but only need to give them the theoretical knowledge required for this profession. On the other hand, because the subjects of study are closely related to the worker's usual professional operation, the worker's learning efficiency and enthusiasm are higher than that of ordinary university students without operational experience. The engineers trained in this way are better than the newly graduated intellectuals of general universities, because in addition to having the same theoretical level, the engineers trained by elderly workers have much richer practical experience, and are therefore better engineers. Facts have proved this to be the case.
    The Bulgarian Agricultural College also has a two-year course for agricultural labor models, giving them professional knowledge that matches their production practice, making them agricultural technicians needed for national construction.
    Due to the active encouragement of the leadership of various countries for the children of workers and peasants to enroll in school, and the efforts to provide them with the convenience of studying, the working-class and peasant composition of university students has gradually increased. Currently, 40% of university students in Poland are from worker backgrounds, 25% are from peasant backgrounds, and 30% are from progressive intellectuals. In specialized colleges in Democratic Germany, 64% of students are from working-class and peasant backgrounds, and 30% are from universities. Among university students in Czechoslovakia, 40% are workers, 10% are from peasant backgrounds, and the rest are progressive intellectuals. In Hungary, 66.7% of all students are workers and peasants, and 58% of university students are workers and peasants. Many university students in Romania are also children of working people (the family composition statistics of university students in Romania in 1952 are 21% workers, 27% peasants, 45% staff children, 1.3% cooperative handicraftsmen, 2.8% self-employed handicraftsmen, 0.5% doctors, and 1.9% wealthy peasants. If only first-year university students are calculated, only 0.2% are children of wealthy peasants).
    In order to train cadres urgently needed for national construction more widely, all higher education institutions have widely established night schools and correspondence schools so that on-the-job personnel can complete higher education without leaving production. Before liberation, some people did not complete the majors they wanted to study due to the pressure of life. Some people felt that they lacked knowledge in their current positions because they used what they did not study after leaving school. In order to do their jobs well, many staff members should complete higher education.
    To enter a correspondence school, one must pass an exam to be assigned a grade. Correspondence schools compile correspondence lectures, with self-study guidance, learning progress, review questions, etc., and send them to students. It is stipulated that personnel who are admitted to correspondence schools may be allowed to work one hour less per day on average in their on-the-job units, or one day less per week, in order to study. On the other hand, students entering correspondence schools should also guarantee a certain amount of study time each week. Every two weeks, they can go to a nearby correspondence school to ask questions about their studies and request answers. Correspondence students also send in answers to review questions on a regular basis so that the correspondence school can review their learning situation. Night schools study for four hours a day, including classes and discussions. Students from worker backgrounds can go to the laboratory to do experiments at a certain time; students from non-worker backgrounds can go to the internship factory to do internships at a certain time. The study period for correspondence schools and night schools is approximately twice as long as the study period for ordinary higher education institutions.
    In order to ensure that the university students who are trained can truly become socialist work cadres, that is, work cadres with patriotism, dedication, discipline, and combativeness, higher education institutions in various countries have stipulated compulsory courses in Marxism-Leninism in terms of curriculum reform, rectified the compulsory courses in national literature, national history, and world history, added compulsory courses in physical education, and carried out universal textbook reform. Generally, they learn from the Soviet Union, consider their own national conditions, and compile new textbooks, requiring the elimination of bourgeois viewpoints in academics. Because the compilation task is heavy and not easy to complete in a short time, Soviet textbooks are sometimes used directly.
    Because teaching must be continuously improved in line with the needs of socialist construction, university professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants have a certain political study system so that they can consciously eliminate erroneous viewpoints in academics. Bulgaria stipulates 45 days of off-the-job study, as well as a two-year night party school (university), so that teachers can systematically study the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, materialist dialectics, political economy, etc. In addition, organize "collective listening to lectures." When a professor lectures, all personnel in the same teaching and research department attend the lectures regularly, and then organize discussions and conduct criticism.
    In comprehensive universities, there are also special departments of philosophy or political economy, which are controlled by a vice-president in charge of political education for the whole school, guiding the study of Marxism-Leninism in the whole school. The professors and students of this department all participate in teaching activities. In order to better implement the ideas of Marxism-Leninism into various scientific businesses and thoroughly eliminate the erroneous viewpoints of the bourgeoisie, the philosophy departments of some higher education institutions stipulate that each student must study a science at the same time so that they can go to the relevant departments or teaching and research departments to work after graduation. Some countries stipulate that each department of higher education institutions should send someone to study in the philosophy department, and return to work in their own department after graduation.
    In addition, learning from the Soviet Union, the "compulsory research work system" is implemented in higher education institutions, that is, university teaching staff spend half of their work time teaching and half doing academic research. All research topics are scientific and technical problems that occur in national construction. In order to make these research work closely and systematically cooperate with practical problems, various countries have implemented the method of university teaching and research departments and relevant production units signing "cooperation contracts." The contract stipulates that the production unit puts forward research topics and tries its best to give the school (in research work) material help. The teaching and research department also strives to complete the research work on schedule and solve the difficult problems in production. The teaching and research department also absorbs technical personnel from relevant production departments as "scientific collaborators" to participate in the work meetings of the department and make suggestions to improve the research and teaching work. Scientific conferences are held every year to read papers and conduct academic discussions. In this way, teaching staff can closely link with reality during teaching time and continuously obtain business progress, so that the teaching level can be improved with the development of production and the growth of scientific and technical level.
    In order to formulate teaching plans, to ensure the completion of teaching plans, and to collectively improve teaching, all higher education institutions learn from the Soviet Union, set up teaching and research departments, and assign them to work in various teaching and research departments according to the scientific expertise of the teaching staff. The teaching and research department stipulates the work plan of the department and the personal work plans of each person, and is responsible for implementing them after being approved by the school authorities, and often holds meetings to discuss improvement methods.
    In order to ensure that the types, quantity, and quality of graduates from higher education institutions can meet the needs of national construction, first of all, each higher education institution decides the enrollment quota according to the national plan. Students take entrance exams before entering school, and are assigned to a certain department and a certain study group until graduation; they may not change departments or groups without permission (each study group has 20 to 30 people). Secondly, in the process of students' learning, the department affairs meetings of each department, the teaching and research departments of each subject, and the study groups of each student often care about and help students who are lagging behind in their studies, and strive to achieve the maximum graduation percentage of students. Before liberation, students in higher education institutions could freely change departments, leave school without graduating, or transfer to study other subjects after graduation without working. Now, the construction work of various people's democratic countries urgently needs graduates from higher education institutions, so it is necessary for schools to train scientific and technical personnel as quickly as possible in terms of type, quantity, and quality. They all strive to achieve the highest graduation rate of students in higher education institutions. For example, the current graduation rate of university students in Romania is 80%, and the graduation rate of university students in Poland has reached 90%. Their countries are also working hard to study the reasons why students cannot graduate and require a higher graduation percentage.
    In order to combine theory with practice and combine knowledge with labor production, all higher education students studying natural sciences, in addition to regular experiments and internships in the school's laboratories, factories, and farms, higher education institutions in various countries learn from the Soviet Union and implement ten months of studying at school each year. During the holidays, students intern at relevant state-owned factories or farms. In the first year, on-site internships only require students to understand the general production situation of factories or farms related to their majors. In the following years, they gradually get closer to and deeply understand the application of their major knowledge in production and its problems. Before graduation, students spend half a year preparing for graduation thesis to respond to the "national examination." In this half year, students first spend about three months going to the relevant production site to collect information related to their major, and discover problems to be studied in the production process, and then report back to the head of the department; after research by the department, the research topic and guiding professor are determined. Before graduation, the research results are written into a thesis, which is reviewed by several professors designated by the department, and then sent to the "national examination" committee. The committee is composed of responsible professors from the department, technical experts from relevant production units, and personnel sent by the Ministry of Higher Education. The committee reviews the thesis and conducts an oral examination to determine whether the student has mastered the knowledge of the major and whether they can graduate to become engineers, technicians, etc.
    In order to ensure that the teaching effect of higher education institutions meets the needs of national construction in terms of quality, higher education institutions in various countries strictly implement the examination system. There are small exams during the course, term exams at the end of the semester, and "national exams" are held at graduation. Each school often statistically analyzes the examination scores to assess teaching performance. Bulgaria also holds national competitive exams for professors and lecturers who are promoted each year, publishes the required types and numbers in the newspaper, and applicants submit thesis results, which are evaluated by the national organization committee.
    Due to the constant care and help of the leadership of various countries for higher education, the higher education of various people's democratic countries has made great progress. For example, Czechoslovakia had only nine higher education institutions with 18,000 students before liberation; now there are 30 schools with 46,000 students. Hungary had 16 higher education institutions with 11,800 students before liberation; now there are 28 schools with 46,000 students. Romania had 16 higher education institutions with 20,000 students before liberation; now there are 50 schools with 55,000 students. Bulgaria had 5 higher education institutions with 9,800 students before liberation; now there are 14 schools with 27,000 students. Poland currently has 14 higher education institutions. Democratic Germany has 6 universities, 1 higher technical school, and 340 specialized schools, with a total of 81,000 students.
    In the higher education institutions of these countries, we often meet industrial and agricultural labor models who personally tell us about their gratitude for the government's training and their enthusiasm for personal efforts to study. We often meet these newly trained socialist workers on production sites, such as some steel factories, machinery factories, chemical factories, experimental farms, canal construction sites, etc., diligently working to build their motherland. All of this makes us feel that the people of the Eastern European people's democratic countries are with us, taking the great Soviet Union as an example, and advancing rapidly towards the socialist road.

    为国家建设服务的东欧人民民主国家的高等教育
    赴东欧人民民主国家文化教育考察团团员  恽子强
    东欧国家在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战期间，由于西方资本主义国家政治、经济侵略的深入，文化教育深受资本主义制度和资产阶级思想的影响。一般知识分子都崇拜西方，卑视自己民族传统，缺乏爱国热忱。讲地理能谈英、法、美、德的城市港口，却不熟悉自己国家的地理。谈科学能说出西方国家的成就，却不能知道它们的缺点，同时也不重视自己民族的成就。由于当时各国在政治、经济上对西方国家居于附庸地位，更由于资本主义社会一贯的无计划生产的状态，教育部提不出教育的明确目标和计划，高等教育主要成为一种装饰品。大学教授们高唱“教育独立”的论调，说“科学和政治无关”。这些世界主义和客观主义的思想笼罩着当时的知识分子，形成教授们随兴趣讲学，大学生随兴趣求学，大家弄不清教学目的。学校不举行考试，毕业没有一定期限。
    法西斯德国的统治曾经更加深了东欧高等教育的灾难。当时波兰的高等学校全部被封闭了，进步教授受到了法西斯的摧残。各国也都产生了一些受法西斯思想毒害的知识分子。德国本身所受的毒害自然是更厉害，使得解放后民主德国教育部感到“没有一本书是能用的”的重担。
    英勇的苏联军队解放了东欧国家，使人民民主政权得以建立。这些人民民主国家都在战争所给予的创伤下努力于恢复工作，经过了几年，都在一九四八年前后，走上了有计划的社会主义建设的阶段。这样，就产生了有计划地、大量地培养“社会主义的工作干部”的需要。所谓“社会主义的工作干部”是一种精通业务而又有高度政治自觉的人。在各国的党和政府的领导下，他们的高等教育都经过有计划的改造，向着紧密地配合着国家建设需要的道路上前进。
    这些人民民主国家的党和政府都预见到这种改造工作所将遇着的困难，做了充分的准备工作，胜利地引导着高等教育走上配合国家建设的道路。波兰高等教育部负责同志曾谈到这一工作需要克服两种基本的矛盾：第一是高等教育工作者的资产阶级思想和社会主义工作需要的矛盾；第二是高等教育的社会主义任务和当时高等学校手工业生产方式的矛盾。
    什么是这些人民民主国家的高等教育的需要呢？这种需要就是有计划地大量地培养社会主义的工作干部；就是要发扬爱国主义；就是要学习苏联；就是要缩短学习年限，而同时提高教学水平；就是要制定统一的高等教育计划；就是要在高等教育系统建立民主集中制；就是要在学校里加强劳动纪律，确定为完成国家任务而奋斗的决心等等。为了这些需要，这些国家必须展开对世界主义思想和客观主义思想的斗争，必须做到团结知识分子，改组旧式学校，以适应新的建设要求。
    为了克服高级知识分子的资产阶级思想和社会主义工作需要的矛盾，波兰曾于一九四九——一九五一年间费了一年半的时间准备“科学会议”。他们从组织各门科学的小型座谈会开始，进到组织各门科学的大会，更进而召集代表全国科学工作者的大会——“科学会议”。这一时期里，他们组织了大小会六百次（参加的人数达二千七百人），其中各门科学大会达一百五十次。通过这些会议，政府团结了五百个进步分子，成为运动的骨干。到一九五一年六月，就召开了“科学会议”，到会一千多人，共代表六十个单位。这一会议展开了广泛的讨论，在科学工作者中间严肃地批判了“教育独立”的反动思想，孤立了少数顽固分子，团结了多数知识分子，响应政府提出的为完成六年计划任务而工作的号召，引起学习苏联先进经验的热潮。会后，教授们是否努力于完成工作计划成为他们进步与否的标志。
    这种对知识分子的思想改造运动，在捷克斯洛伐克也曾经做过。他们首先在部队文教机关里发现教学上严重的世界主义倾向，就于一九五二年初在捷克斯洛伐克第二大城布尔诺召集了全国高级文教机关、各大学的代表会议。会议首先由萨波托斯基（当时捷副总理）和柯柏茨基（捷政府文化宣传部部长）作了批评世界主义和客观主义的报告，经大会讨论，各代表分别回原机关传达，又在本机关展开讨论。结果在高等教育机关里获得广泛的思想转变的效果。知识分子开始由脱离实际的作风转向要求为配合国家建设计划而工作。
    这些国家制定国家建设计划时，都提出了大量培养科学技术干部的要求。例如波兰的六年计划要求六年里培养出十四万五千技术人员。旧的大学每年小量地培养大学生，是不能应付新形势的要求的。为了解决高等教育中手工业生产方式，不能有计划地、大量地培养社会主义工作干部的问题，他们调整了院校的组织，学习苏联教育制度，增加校、系、专业。原来，欧洲由于宗教的传统力量，大学里常设有神学院。其次，大学生学文学、法律的比重也大。有的国家，教会直接掌握许多学校。例如在匈牙利一九四八年学校统由国家管理以前，全国七千九百七十一校中有五千三百二十七校在教会手里。大学组织变革时，神学院划归教会。工学院、医学院、农学院或其他院系常是按国家建设需要，由大学划出成为独立学院，或在有关生产地区增设建设需要的高等学校。例如波兰将各大学造船系合并成造船学院，设在革但斯克。匈牙利新建拉科西重工业学院，设有矿工、机械、钢铁等系，校址在有炼钢厂的密斯科尔兹城，目前学生已达一千八百人。捷克斯洛伐克在斯洛伐克区新建许多工厂，斯洛伐克首府布拉的斯拉发的工学院就扩充到有了电机、机械、建筑、化学、工业经济等系，学生达四千人。罗马尼亚将原来布加勒斯特工学院的采矿系、化学系的一部分调整出来，一九四八年成立了石油瓦斯学院。第一年只有一百五十名学生，现已有一千五百名学生，将来拟增到四千五百人。现设有四系，即地质勘测系、石油开采系、炼油工程系、工程设备系。保加利亚农业中心普乐夫的夫城的农学院原为大学一系，于一九五○年成立独立学院，现设有农艺、园艺、食品工业三系，共有一千一百学生。著名的德国德累斯顿高等工业学校在一九五二年学生数达五千八百人，另加工农预科学生二千人，函授学生四千人，教职员一千四百人，成为一万三千人的高等学校。其他，如波兰的华沙大学，克拉科大学，德国的柏林洪堡大学，莱比锡大学，罗斯多克大学，捷克斯洛伐克的卡尔大学，匈牙利的葛苏特大学，罗马尼亚的巴洪大学，保加利亚的索非亚大学等等都在同一配合国家建设需要方向下调整了组织，扩大了招生量。
    高等学校调整后，院校数目增多起来，教师就不够了（特别是自然科学方面）。补救办法是将一些高等学校设在有关生产所在地区。这样，可以就近抽调工农技术专家兼任讲员。例如，匈牙利由于这样办理，使高等学校增加了二百个讲师。另外，为了解决高等学校师资的不断增加的需要，各国都有计划地逐渐抽调优秀的大学毕业生为各教研室的研究生，培养他们为大学教师，又有计划地派遣留学生去苏联及兄弟国家学习。
    在资产阶级的国家里，大学是资产阶级及地主阶级的子女享受教育的地方。解放前的东欧国家自然也没有例外。例如在波兰战前的大学生是地主资产阶级出身的占百分之四十三，高级职员子女占百分之三十，富农子女占百分之十四。德国在第二次大战前大学生只百分之二是工农子女。捷克斯洛伐克在解放前大学生只百分之七为工农子女。匈牙利在解放前大学生百分之三点五是工农子女，罗马尼亚学生成分战前百分之九十五属剥削阶级。
    解放后人民民主政权为了加速培养工农青年，使成为国家建设的骨干，努力使大学向劳动人民开门。一般办法是在大学附设工农预科。这种预科最初常是短期的，例如半年期的补习班，以后逐渐延长到两年。
    这些国家的党和政府都重视工农预科。为了鼓励工农子女入学，常常规定给以更多的助学金。例如民主德国规定工农子女入学一般每月补助一百八十马克，中等成绩的补助二百二十马克，优等的补助二百六十马克。资产阶级子女优等的可得一百三十马克，最优成绩的才能得一百八十马克。其他国家也有类似的规定。
    为了解决工农子女入学的经济困难，有的在助学金里规定有假期回家费，有的国家规定结婚及生子的另给补助。为了解决他们食宿的困难，举办“大学公寓”、“大学食堂”。在初期为了鼓励工农子女入大学，规定在工农预科毕业者入大学可免入学考试。直到工农子女入学数目加到一定限度才举行入学考试。
    尽管情况是如此，但是在初期，还有另外的困难。一些深受资产阶级影响的大学教授每每故意提高学习内容，使得工农学生难于消化，又在考试中给以难题，使不能及格。例如在匈牙利曾因此引起工农成分学生大批退学；后来在一九五○年匈牙利劳动人民党作出决议严厉地批判了这一现象，才改正了这一缺点。
    民主德国在动员工农积极分子入大学的工作中，一直到一九四八年都还感到相当困难。原因是几方面的。首先本人只看重现有的技术，认为学习理论是不重要的。其次工厂不愿放出生产中的积极分子，怕影响了本单位的生产。另外本人的父母为了儿子的补助赡养的收入，也不愿儿子去学习。这些困难只在一些人从大学毕业后，有了更高的技能，获得更高的工资，又加上青年团员的广泛政治工作，才逐渐克服。有些学校为了克服劳动人民怕学理论的困难，编写了“应如何读书”，指出学习理论的必要和读书的方法，以养成工农子女克服一切困难的精神，培养他们掌握理论的决心。
    为了提高五年、十年工龄的工人到工程师的水平，各国学习苏联，在大学里开设两年的课程，以便在两年里提高他们到工程师的水平。这种可能性是由于工龄高的工人对于一项专业的操作经验积累得相当丰富，因而在学习中不需要像一般大学生一样加上许多实习课目，而只要给以这一专业所需的理论知识就够了。另一方面，又由于学习的课目紧密联系着工人平时的专业操作，工人学习的效率和积极性都比普通没有操作经验的大学生来得高。这样培养出来的工程师比一般大学新毕业的知识分子更好，因为除了有同等的理论水平外，老龄工人培养成的工程师有丰富得多的实际经验，因而是更好的工程师。事实证明是如此的。
    保加利亚农学院也有为农业劳动模范开设的两年课程，给他们以和他们的生产实践相配合的专业知识，使他们成为国家建设所需要的农业技师。
    由于各国领导方面积极鼓励工农子女入学，并努力给他们以求学的便利，大学生的工农成分逐渐增多。目前波兰大学生工人出身的占百分之四十，农民百分之二十五，进步知识分子百分之三十。民主德国专门学院学生中，工农出身的达百分之六十四，大学里达百分之三十。捷克斯洛伐克的大学生，工人占百分之四十，农民出身占百分之十，余为进步知识分子。匈牙利全体学生中工农占百分之六十六点七，大学生里占百分之五十八。罗马尼亚大学生也有很多是劳动人民子女（罗马尼亚一九五二年的大学生家庭成分统计是工人百分之二十一，农民百分之二十七，职员子女百分之四十五，合作手工业者百分之一点三，自由手工业者百分之二点八，医师百分之零点五，富农百分之一点九。若单以大学一年级生计算，则富农子女只有百分之零点二）。
    为了更广泛地培养国家建设亟需的干部，各高等学校都广泛设立夜校，函授学校，以便在职人员不脱离生产，可以完成高等教育。解放前，有些人为生活所迫，没有学完自己愿学的专业。有些人由于离开学校后用非所学，在现在工作岗位上就感到知识的不足。为了做好工作，有许多工作人员是应该补完高等教育的。
    入函授学校应经过考试编级。函授学校编就函授讲义，附有自学指导，学习进度，复习题等，寄给学生。规定考入函授学校的人员，在在职机关平均每日可准少做工作一小时，或每周可少做一日工作，以便学习。另方面，入函授学校的学生，每周也应保证一定的学习时间。每二星期可到附近函授学校提出学习中的疑难，要求解答。函授生也按期寄复习题答案，以便由函授学校审核学习情况。夜校每日学习四小时，包括上课及讨论。工人出身的学生可于一定时间到实验室做实验；非工人出身的学生可于一定时间到实习工厂实习。函授学校和夜校的学习年限约比普通高等学校学习年限加长一倍。
    为了使培养出来的大学生能真正成为社会主义的工作干部，即具有爱国心，事业心，有纪律性，有战斗性的工作干部，各国高等学校在课程改革方面都规定了马克思列宁主义的必修课，整顿了本国文、本国史、世界史的必修课，加设了体育的必修课，并进行了普遍的教材改革。一般都是学习苏联，斟酌本国条件，进行编写新教材，要求铲除学术中的资产阶级观点。因为编写任务繁重，一时不易完成，有时直接用苏联教科书。
    因为要使教学不断地配合着社会主义建设的需要而改进，对大学教授、讲师、助教们有一定的政治学习制度，以便能自觉地铲除学术中的错误观点。保加利亚规定有四十五天的离职学习，更有两年制的夜党校（大学），使教师有计划地学习马克思列宁主义基础知识，唯物辩证法，政治经济学等。另外组织“集体听讲”。当某一教授讲授时，同一教研室全体人员定期出席听讲，然后组织讨论，进行批评。
    在综合性大学里并特设哲学系或政治经济学系，由一个负全校政治教育的副校长掌握着，指导全校的马克思列宁主义的学习。这一系的教授学生们都参加教学活动。为了把马克思列宁主义的思想更好地贯彻到各门科学业务中去，彻底铲除资产阶级的错误观点，有的高等学校哲学系规定每一学生必须同时学习一门科学，以便毕业后到有关的系或教研室去做工作。有的国家规定要高等学校各系抽派专人去哲学系学习，毕业后回本系工作。
    此外，学习苏联，在高等学校实行了“义务研究工作制”，即大学教学人员均以工作时间的一半教学，一半做学术研究。所有研究题目都是国家建设中所发生的科学技术问题。为了使这些研究工作能紧密地、有计划地配合实际问题，各国都实行大学教研室和有关生产单位订立“合作合同”的办法。在合同里规定生产单位提出研究题目并尽力给学校（在研究工作中）以物质的帮助。教研室也努力如期完成研究工作，解决生产中的困难问题。教研室并吸收有关生产部门的技术人员为“科学合作者”，参加本室工作会议，提出建议，使研究及教学工作获得改进。每年又举行科学会议宣读论文，进行学术讨论。这样教学人员就在教学时间里，密切地联系实际而不断获得业务上的进步，使教学水平能随着生产的发展和科学技术水平的增长而提高。
    为了制订教学计划，为了保证教学计划的完成，为了集体地改进教学，各高等学校都学习苏联，设置教学研究室，按教学人员的科学专长分配他们到各教研室工作。教研室规定本室工作计划及各个人工作计划，经学校当局批准后负责执行，并经常开会讨论改进的方法。
    为了保证高等学校毕业生的种类、数量及质量，能够符合国家建设的需要，首先各高等学校按照国家计划来决定招生额。学生入学前举行入学考试，入学后编入一定学系，一定学习小组，直到毕业为止；非经允许不得转系转组（每一学习小组有二十至三十人）。其次在学生学习过程中，各系系务会议，各科教研室，学生各个学习小组，都经常关心帮助学习落后的学生，务求学生达到最大的毕业百分率。解放前，高等学校学生可以自由转系，也可以不毕业即离开学校，也可以毕业后不做工作又转学其他学科。现在各人民民主国家的建设工作亟需高等学校毕业生，因而要按种类、数量和质量，由学校尽速造就科学技术人员。他们对高等学校学生毕业率都是努力求得最高的。例如罗马尼亚大学生毕业率现达百分之八十，波兰大学生毕业率已达百分之九十，他们国家还努力研究学生不能毕业的原因，要求达到更高的毕业百分率。
    为了使理论联系实际，知识和劳动生产相结合，一切学自然科学的高等学校学生，除了经常在学校的实验室、工厂、农场实验和实习外，各国高等学校学习苏联，实行每年在校学习十个月。假期中学生到有关的国营工厂或农场实习。第一年现场实习只要求学生了解和个人所学专业有关的工厂或农场的一般生产状况。以后逐年更接近于深入了解所学专业知识在生产中的应用及其问题。临毕业前，学生以半年时间准备毕业论文，以应“国家考试”。在这半年，学生首先以约三个月时间去有关的生产现场搜集和自己所学专业有关的资料，并在生产过程中发现应研究的问题，然后回学校报告本系负责人；经本系研究后，决定研究题目及指导的教授。毕业前，将研究结果写成论文，经本系指定几个教授审查后，送给“国家考试”委员会。委员会由本系负责教授、有关生产单位的技术专家及高等教育部所派人员组成。委员会审查论文并举行口试，以确定学生是否已经掌握本专业的学识，是否能够毕业，成为工程师、技师等。
    为了保证高等学校教学效果在质量上适应国家建设需要，各国高等学校都严格执行考试制度。课程进行中有小考，学期终了有学期考试，毕业时又举行“国家考试”。各校都经常统计考试分数，以考核教学成绩。保加利亚对于每年提升的教授及讲师，也举行国家竞考，登报宣布所需种类及人数，应征者提出论文成绩，由国家组织委员会评选。
    由于各国领导方面对高等教育的不断关怀和帮助，各人民民主国家的高等教育都有很大的发展。例如捷克斯洛伐克解放前高等学校只有九所，学生一万八千人；目前有了三十校，学生达四万六千人。匈牙利高等学校解放前有十六校，学生一万一千八百人，目前达二十八校，学生四万六千人。罗马尼亚高等学校解放前有十六校，学生二万人；目前达五十校，学生五万五千人。保加利亚高等学校解放前有五校，学生九千八百人；目前达十四校，学生二万七千人。波兰现有高等学校十四所。民主德国有大学六所，高等工业学校一所，专门学校三百四十所，共有学生八万一千人。
    我们在这些国家的高等学校里常遇见工农劳动模范亲自告诉对于政府培养的感激和个人努力学习的热忱。我们又常在生产现场，例如一些钢铁工厂、机械工厂、化学工厂、实验农场、运河工程地等地方，遇见这样培养出来的新型社会主义工作者辛勤地为了建设自己的祖国而劳动。这些都使我们感到东欧人民民主国家的人民是和我们在一起，以伟大的苏联为榜样，向着社会主义的道路迅速地前进。
