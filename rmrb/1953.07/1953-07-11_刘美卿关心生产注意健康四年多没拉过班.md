    Liu Meiqing, a doffing worker in the fine spinning workshop of Jinan Chengda Textile Factory, is only in her twenties, but she has been working in the factory for eleven years. Before liberation, life was hard, and she was oppressed, so she often had to work extra shifts, and her work wasn't good. However, since liberation more than four years ago, she hasn't missed a single shift, nor has she been late or left early. One winter, there was heavy snow and strong winds, and many workers didn't come to work, but she braved the wind and snow to get to work. She said, "Since liberation, the factory belongs to us workers. It doesn't matter if I don't work at home, but if I don't go to work at the factory, I feel bad!"
    She works actively and has excellent production results. For example, she used to take fifty seconds to doff, but now she has reduced it to more than thirty seconds. In 1951, when advanced work methods were promoted, she not only studied diligently herself but also helped others learn. She said, "We didn't create advanced work methods for the country. If we don't learn the good methods that others have created, can we still call ourselves masters of the country?"
    The main reasons why she can avoid missing shifts and also do a good job are not only her high level of awareness but also her attention to her own life and the good care she takes of her body. Whether it's a day shift or a night shift, she always makes sure to get eight hours of sleep every day. When the weather changes slightly, she pays attention to changing her clothes and also washes her hair, takes showers, and trims her nails in a timely manner. She doesn't eat cold food or drink cold water.
    Because of her good work ethic, the workers who work with her treat her very well and praise her as an expert in production. As a result, she has been named a production model twice and a study model once.

    刘美卿关心生产注意健康四年多没拉过班
    时代
    济南成大纱厂细纱车间乙班落纱工人刘美卿才二十多岁，可是她在工厂里已干了十一年活。解放以前，生活不好，又被人欺压，她经常拉班，工作也不好。可是，自解放以来四年多，她没有拉过一次班，也没有迟到早退过。有一年冬天，那天下大雪刮大风，很多工人都没有来上班，可是她冒着大风大雪也赶来上班。她说：“解放以后工厂是咱们工人自己的，在家里不干活还不要紧，不到工厂干活心里就不好过！”
    她干活积极，生产成绩很好。比如说，以前她落纱得用五十秒钟，现在已经减到三十多秒钟。一九五一年推广先进工作法时，她不但自己积极学，并且帮助别人学。她说：“我们没有为国家创造先进工作法，还不学人家创造出的好办法，这还能说得上是国家主人吗？”
    她所以能不拉班，又能干好活，主要原因除了觉悟高以外，她还注意自己的生活，很好地保养自己的身体。她不管白班或夜班，总要保持每天睡足八小时。天气稍有变化，她就注意调换衣服，并适时地洗头、洗澡、修指甲，不吃冷食也不喝凉水。
    由于她的工作态度好，和她一块干活的工人对她都很好，称赞她为生产中的能手。因此，她曾经两次被评为生产模范，一次被评为学习模范。
