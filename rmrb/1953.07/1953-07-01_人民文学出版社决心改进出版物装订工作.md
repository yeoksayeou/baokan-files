    People's Literature Publishing House Resolves to Improve Bookbinding Work

    Letter from People's Literature Publishing House: The People's Daily published on June 16th a reader's criticism, Xue Xingbai, regarding the shortcomings in the bookbinding of our publications. We should accept this criticism. Prior to this, we had also received letters from other readers pointing out the shortcomings in the bookbinding of our publications; we responded to them separately, exchanged the books, and made responsible handling. In the past, we also made some improvements in checking the quality of bookbinding, such as strengthening inspections and holding meetings with personnel from the bookbinding workshops, but the facts prove that it is still far from enough. We are very grateful for Comrade Xue Xingbai's criticism, which made us realize that the shortcomings in this area still exist seriously. The reasons for the bookbinding errors in our publications are mainly that our printing and binding locations are too scattered, and staff members cannot conduct centralized inspections. Secondly, we still lack strict contractual constraints on the bookbinding workshops, so the bookbinding quality cannot be improved, and errors are still prone to occur. In addition to paying more attention to inspection work in the future, we will consider concluding a stricter quality assurance contract with the bookbinding workshops to strengthen the binding department's sense of responsibility and responsibility system in its work.

    Regarding the two books that Comrade Xue Xingbai bought, please send them to our publishing house for exchange. For books with missing pages or repeated binding, we can rebind them so that they do not become waste. If other readers also have publications of our publishing house with binding errors, please send them to our publishing house for exchange. The postage for sending books back and forth will be borne by our publishing house.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    人民文学出版社决心改进出版物装订工作
    人民文学出版社来信：人民日报六月十六日刊登了读者薛性白对我社出版物装订上的缺点的批评。这一批评，我们是应当接受的。在此以前，我们也曾接到其他读者的来信，指出我社出版物装订上的缺点；我们都分别给了答复，掉换了书，作了负责的处理。在装订质量的检查方面，过去我们也做了一些改进的工作，例如加强检查及与装订所人员举行了会议等，但事实证明还是很不够的。我们十分感谢薛性白同志的批评，使我们了解到这方面的缺点还严重的存在着。我社出版物装订错误产生的原因，主要是我们的印刷及装订场所过于分散，工作人员无法集中进行检查。其次，我们对装订所还缺乏严格的合同约束，因而装订质量不能改善，仍旧容易出错误。今后改进的办法，除了我们更注意检查工作以外，我们将考虑与装订所订立更严格的质量保证合同，以加强装订部门在工作上的责任心与责任制度。
    关于薛性白同志买的两本书，请他寄来我社掉换。对于缺页或装订重复的书，我们可以重装，使不致成为废物。其他读者如也有装订错误的我社的出版物，也请寄来我社掉换。寄递往返的寄书费均由我社负担。
