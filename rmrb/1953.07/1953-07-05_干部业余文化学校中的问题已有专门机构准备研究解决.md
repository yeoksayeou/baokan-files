Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    A letter from the Secretariat of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council states: The "Reader's Letters Summary" published in the May 29th issue under the title "Conscientiously Run Cadre Spare-Time Cultural Schools" reflected some problems in the work of cadre spare-time cultural schools in some areas. We have also recently received many letters from the public reflecting similar problems. In addition to forwarding these letters to the relevant authorities for appropriate resolution, a specialized institution has been established to study and resolve them in a unified manner in the near future.

    干部业余文化学校中的问题已有专门机构准备研究解决
    中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会秘书处来信：五月二十九日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了以“认真办好干部业余文化学校”为题的“读者来信综述”，反映了某些地区干部业余文化学校工作中的一些问题。我们最近也曾接到不少群众来信，反映同类的问题。这些来信所反映的问题，除先行分别转请各有关机关适当解决外，并已成立专门机构，准备在最近期间统一研究解决。
