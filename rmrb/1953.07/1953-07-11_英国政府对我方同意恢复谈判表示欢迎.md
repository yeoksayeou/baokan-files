Xinhua News Agency, London, July 10th: The Acting Prime Minister of Britain, Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler, stated in the House of Commons on the 9th that the British government is delighted that the Korean and Chinese sides have agreed to resume meetings between the delegations to discuss issues related to the implementation of the armistice agreement. Butler made these remarks in response to a question from a member of parliament. During the questioning, Labour MP Richard Acland expressed dissatisfaction with the open support of U.S. Senators Knowland and McCarthy for Syngman Rhee's actions to undermine the armistice. He said that the time has come for Britain to make it clear that it cannot participate in a war that has "no other purpose than to support Syngman Rhee's aggressive ambitions." Butler replied that both sides of the Atlantic recognize this.

    英国政府对我方同意恢复谈判表示欢迎
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦消息：代理英国首相职务的财政大臣巴特勒九日在下议院中说，英国政府对于朝中方面同意恢复双方代表团会议商谈有关实施停战协定问题感到欢欣。巴特勒的话是在答复一个议员的质询时说的。在质询中，工党议员理查德·艾克兰德对于美国参议员诺兰和麦卡锡公然支持李承晚的破坏停战的态度表示不满。他说，现在已经到了英国必须说明它决不能参加“除了支持李承晚的侵略企图之外毫无其他目的”的战争的阶段了。巴特勒答复说，大西洋的两岸都认识到这一切。
