Eastern European Sanatorium Resorts

Work and rest are now the most fundamental rights of the working people in the Eastern European People's Democracies. In addition to the fifty-two Sundays of vacation per year, employees also have a considerable number of paid holidays. The length of these holidays is determined by the employee's length of service, generally ranging from two to three weeks, while workers in more demanding jobs, such as miners, have even longer holidays than general employees. During these holidays, most employees go to famous domestic sanatorium areas to rest and improve their physical and mental health.

To help vacationing employees rest well, trade union organizations in various countries have established numerous sanatoriums and convalescent hospitals in scenic locations specifically for receiving vacationing employees. Employees participating in vacation activities organized by the trade union can also enjoy free or discounted transportation, meals, and other benefits. During employees' vacations, there are various cultural and recreational activities, such as skiing and skating in winter, swimming, sailing, camping in summer, as well as travel, mountain climbing, games, sports, dancing, movies, and artistic performance evenings.

Every year, from early spring to late autumn, especially during the scorching summer, the sanatorium areas in Eastern European People's Democracies receive batches of working people from all over the country who come for vacation.

The most famous sanatorium in Hungary is Lake Balaton. Its location can be easily found on the map of the Balkan Peninsula. It is the largest inland lake and one of the most beautiful scenic areas in Europe. In Hungarian classical and modern literature, there are many works praising Lake Balaton. After Hungary's liberation, Lake Balaton became a place for the working people of the whole country to vacation and recuperate. Every year, a total of fifty to sixty thousand people and tens of thousands of children come here to rest and play on the eighty-kilometer-long lakeshore. At the rising sun of the morning and the bright moonlit night, Lake Balaton attracts tourists in various different poses. People often take yachts or sailboats far from the shore. For the people of the landlocked country of Hungary, it is most exciting and pleasant to sail on the vast lake.

Romania has many sanatorium resorts. The scenic area on the Black Sea coast is the most popular place for the working people to go. The natural bathing beaches and sanatoriums along the coast receive many guests every year. "Hercules Baths" is one of the famous sanatorium areas. The sanatorium there now has one thousand fixed beds. People suffering from rheumatism can quickly regain their health here. In another coastal area, Eforie, several sanatoriums specializing in the treatment of bone tuberculosis have been established for children. In addition, many sanatoriums have been established in other scenic areas and former palaces of princes and nobles for the working people to enjoy. In order to allow the working people to have a good rest, Romania has allocated more than 30 million lei between 1948 and 1952 to build resort areas and expand sanatoriums. Now Romania has fifteen major sanatorium areas and more than seventy local sanatorium areas. This year, the sanatoriums and resorts all over Romania will receive 300,000 people for recuperation.

Czechoslovakia has almost a thousand springs (including hot springs), more than any other country in Europe. These places are natural resorts. Now, the sanatoriums and resorts located near the springs of Karlovy Vary, Piestany and Sliac, which are well-known at home and abroad, have opened their doors to the working people. The number of people going to various scenic spots across the country for recuperation has increased rapidly from more than 4,000 in 1945 to 310,000 last year. The number of sanatoriums and convalescent hospitals has also increased more than twenty times. Now Czechoslovakia has hundreds of sanatoriums and resorts, and 340,000 people will go to these places for vacation this year.

The Sofia Plain, the Balkan Mountains and the Black Sea coast are places for the working people of Bulgaria to recuperate. The coastal city of Stalin, known as the Pearl of the Black Sea, is famous throughout the country and Europe for its majestic and beautiful mountains and rivers, orchards and forests. There are many modern seaside hotels, sanatoriums, student hostels and well-equipped Young Pioneer camps in the city. Summer is the busiest season here. Tourists from all over the country flock here. Excellent musicians, opera singers and painters also come here to perform for vacationing workers and hold art exhibitions. These activities often attract many people and enrich the city's cultural life. Every day after sunset, vacationing people stroll along the boulevards and seaside roads in twos and threes, or go to the open-air theater to watch new programs. At this time, young students unfurl the sails of their yachts in preparation for a trial voyage, while lively Young Pioneers sit around campfires in the vineyards singing their favorite songs.

Krynica is one of the most famous sanatorium centers in Poland. It is located in the middle of a huge valley, surrounded by dense forests. The spring water here is mineral water that is beneficial to the skin. There are a total of four hundred modern sanatoriums and convalescent hospitals with two thousand beds, as well as stadiums, swimming pools and other facilities. In addition to Krynica, the Tatra Mountains, more than 2,000 meters above sea level, the wide Baltic Sea coast, the banks of the Vistula River, the hot springs of Silesia and Zakopane in the south are also places where vacationers leave their footprints. In order to enable workers in various industries to receive effective recuperation, thirteen well-equipped sanatoriums that can accommodate 1,500 people in the best resort areas in the country—Krynica, Teplice and Szczawno—have been handed over to the workers of the coal mining, steel, machinery manufacturing, chemical and textile industries for their enjoyment. In the first quarter of this year, a total of 65,000 employees stayed in sanatoriums and resorts.

The expansion and improvement of sanatorium areas and the rapid increase in the number of vacationers are one of the signs of the happy life of the working people in Eastern European People's Democracies. It demonstrates the tireless concern of the parties and governments of these countries for the welfare of the working people. The working people of all countries know that their happy life is based on the continuous development of production, so after their vacation, they return to their jobs with more energy and create more wealth for their motherland with active labor, contributing more to the prosperity of their motherland.

    东欧的疗养胜地
    工作与休息现在是东欧人民民主国家劳动人民最基本的权利。职工们除了在一年中有五十二个星期天的休假日外，还有为数不少的照领薪资的假期。这种假期的多少是按职工工龄的长短而规定的，一般都在两个星期到三个星期左右，而担任比较繁重工作的工人如矿工们的休假日则比一般职工还要多些。在假期中，职工们大多是到国内著名的疗养地区去休息，以增进身心的健康。
    为了帮助休假职工们很好地进行休息，各国工会组织都在本国风景幽美的地方设有许多休养所和疗养院，专门接待休假职工。参加工会所组织的休假活动的职工，并可享受免费或减价的车票、饮食等福利。在职工休假期间有各种各样的文化娱乐活动，如冬季的滑雪、溜冰，夏季的游泳、赛船、露营以及旅行、爬山、游戏、运动、跳舞、电影和文艺欣赏晚会等等。
    每年从初春到晚秋这一段期间，特别是在赤日炎炎的夏天，东欧各人民民主国家的每个疗养地区就一批一批地接待着从全国各地前来休假的劳动人民。
    匈牙利最著名的疗养地是巴拉顿湖。在巴尔干半岛的地图上可以很容易地找到它的位置。它是欧洲最大的内陆湖与最美丽的风景区之一。在匈牙利的古典与现代的文学中，可以找到不少赞美巴拉顿湖的作品。在匈牙利解放以后，巴拉顿湖成了全国劳动人民度假与休养的场所。在周围八十公里的湖岸上，每年总有五、六万人和好几万儿童到这里来休息游乐。在朝日东升的清晨，和明月皎洁的夜晚，巴拉顿湖都以各种不同的姿态吸引着游人。人们常常乘着游艇或风帆离岸远游。对于内陆国家匈牙利的人民来说，在辽阔的湖面上作乘风破浪之行，是最兴奋愉快不过的了。
    罗马尼亚的疗养胜地是不少的。黑海海滨的风景地区是劳动人民最爱去的地方。沿岸的天然浴场和疗养所每年都要接待许多客人，“赫邱利浴场”是著名的疗养区之一。那里的疗养所现在已有一千个固定的床位。患有风湿病的人们在这里能够很快地恢复自己的健康。在另一个海滨区爱福尼亚，现在已为儿童们建立了几所专治骨结核症的疗养院，除此以外，还在其他的风景区和从前的王公贵族们的别墅里设立了许多休养所，供劳动人民享用。为了让劳动人民得到很好的休养，罗马尼亚在一九四八年至一九五二年之间已拨付了三千多万列伊来建设休养地和扩充疗养院。现在罗马尼亚全国已有十五个大疗养区和七十多个地方疗养区。今年罗马尼亚全国各地的疗养地和休养所将接待三十万人去休养。
    捷克斯洛伐克国内的泉水（包括温泉在内）几乎有一千处，比欧洲任何一个国家都多。这些地方都是天然的休养处所。现在设在闻名国内外的卡尔罗维·伐利、皮斯塔尼和斯立亚克等泉水附近的疗养院和休养所，已为劳动人民打开了大门。到全国各名胜地区去休养的人数从一九四五年的四千多人迅速增加到去年的三十一万人。休养所和疗养院的数目也增加了二十多倍。现在捷克斯洛伐克全国已有好几百个休养所和疗养院，今年去这些地方休假的人将达三十四万人。
    索非亚平原、巴尔干山间与黑海沿岸等处是保加利亚劳动人民休养的所在地。被称为黑海明珠的海滨城市斯大林诺，以它雄伟秀丽的山水、果园与森林而闻名于全国和欧洲。城里有许多现代化的海滨旅馆、休养所、学生招待所和设备齐全的少年先锋营。夏天是这里最热闹的季节。全国各地的游客纷至沓来。优秀的音乐家、歌剧演员与画家也都来到这里为休假的劳动人民演出和举行画展。这些活动常常吸引着不少的人们，而丰富了这个城市的文化生活。每到夕阳西下以后，休假的人们就三三两两地到林荫大道与海滨公路上漫步散心，或到露天剧场去观赏新的节目。这时，年轻的学生扯起了游艇的风帆准备试航，而活泼的少年先锋队员们则在葡萄园里围坐在营火旁边唱起自己最心爱的歌曲。
    克里尼查是波兰最著名的疗养中心之一。它位在一个巨大的山谷中间，四周都是浓密的森林。这里的泉水是对皮肤有益的矿水。在这里共有四百所现代化的休养所和拥有两千个床位的疗养院，还有体育场、游泳池等设备。除了克里尼查外，拔海二千多公尺的塔特拉山区、宽广的波罗的海海滨、维斯杜拉河的两岸、西里西亚的温泉与南方的查库邦尼等地，也是休假人们的足迹遍布之处。为了使各业工人得到有效的疗养，现在设立在全国最好的休养地——克里尼查、特普利查与沙夫诺夫等地可以容纳一千五百人的设备齐全的十三个疗养院，已分别交给煤矿、钢铁、机器制造、化学与纺织业的工人们享用。在今年第一季中，住过疗养院和休养所的职工共有六万五千人。
    疗养地区的扩大和设备改善以及休养人数的迅速增加，是东欧人民民主国家劳动人民幸福生活的标志之一。它表现了这些国家的党和政府对于劳动人民福利的不倦关怀。各国劳动人民深知自己的幸福生活是建立在生产的不断发展的基础上的，因此他们在度假休息之后，就带着更加饱满的精力回到自己的工作岗位，用积极的劳动，为自己的祖国创造更多的财富，为祖国的繁荣兴盛贡献出更多的力量。（附图片）
