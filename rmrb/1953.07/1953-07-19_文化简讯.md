　　Hangzhou Workers' Cultural Palace Clinic Uses Closed Therapy to Treat
　　Dockworkers' Occupational Diseases such as Lumbar Contusions and Sprains
　　The Hangzhou Workers' Cultural Palace Clinic has been using Soviet closed therapy to treat occupational diseases of dockworkers, such as lumbar contusions, sprains, and allergic urticaria (commonly known as hives), with very good results.

　　The main task of the clinic is to provide medical care for employees in decentralized industries and dockworkers throughout the city. The most common and difficult-to-treat diseases among dockworkers are lumbar injuries caused by carrying heavy objects and allergic urticaria caused by frequent contact with mold or chemicals. Since January of this year, the clinic's director, Dr. Lu Bingzhong, has been studying the use of closed therapy, injecting anesthetics into the renal capsule, to treat these two diseases. He has administered 183 injections, with very good results. Among the 54 cases of severe lumbar injuries treated, 17 new injury patients have recovered; 26 patients with recurrent old injuries have shown significant improvement after treatment and are continuing treatment; and the 11 patients currently undergoing treatment have also made great progress. Xu Zhiquan, a dockworker in Hangzhou's Gongshu District, suffered a lumbar contusion in October of last year, which often caused pain, especially on cloudy days. After renal capsule closure therapy, he can now carry 300 to 400 pounds of goods without feeling soreness even on cloudy days. Elderly worker Liu Shoufei developed allergic urticaria all over his body 25 years ago after carrying moldy goods, with outbreaks every two or three days. After renal capsule closure therapy, the outbreaks have stopped.

　　The Hangzhou Municipal People's Government Health Bureau has instructed the clinic to summarize its experience and help other medical institutions promote this therapy.

　　Teachers and Students of Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine
　　Use Summer Vacation to Experience Life in Pastoral Areas
　　Teachers and students of the Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine are using their summer vacation to experience life on the grasslands. The students of the Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine come from all over the country, and most of them have never seen the grasslands, so they are very interested in going to the grasslands during the summer vacation. The teachers and students of the college have already divided into two teams in late June and gone to the Hulunbuir League grassland and the Chahar League grassland. On the grasslands, the students plan to focus on understanding the feeding and management of livestock in pastoral areas, grassland management, and livestock diseases. The third- and fourth-year students going to Hulunbuir League will also help the government with livestock epidemic prevention work.

　　Before departure, in addition to actively preparing relevant materials, instruments and other internship tools, everyone also enthusiastically discussed how to improve relations with the masses and how to respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities. Some students also seized the time to practice Mongolian dance and other cultural and entertainment programs, preparing to have a get-together with the herdsmen.

    杭州工人文化宫诊疗所用封闭疗法治疗
    搬运工人腰部挫伤、扭伤等职业病
    杭州市工人文化宫诊疗所运用苏联封闭疗法医治搬运工人的腰部挫伤、扭伤以及过敏性荨麻疹（俗称风疹块）等职业病，收到很好效果。
    该诊疗所的主要任务是负责医疗全市分散行业的职工以及搬运工人的疾病。搬运工人中最多见而又不易治好的疾病是由于背负重物所产生的腰部受伤，以及由于常常接触霉潮或化学物品所产生的过敏性荨麻疹。该所所长陆秉忠医师从今年一月起，就着手研究用注射麻醉剂到肾囊内的封闭疗法来医治这两种病，先后注射了一百八十三次，效果都很好。接受这种治疗的五十四个腰部重伤病例中，十七个新伤病人已痊愈；二十六个屡发陈伤病人经治疗后有显著好转，正在继续治疗中的十一个病人也已有很大进步。该市拱墅区搬运工人徐志泉去年十月间腰部受了挫伤，时常作痛，阴天痛得更厉害，经过肾囊内封闭治疗后已能背运三、四百斤的货物，阴天也不感酸痛了。老年工人柳守飞在二十五年前因为背了霉潮的货物，全身发生过敏性荨麻疹，每隔二、三天发作一次，经过肾囊内封闭治疗后已不再发作。
    杭州市人民政府卫生局已指示该所总结经验并帮助其他医疗机构推行这种疗法。
    内蒙古畜牧兽医学院师生
    利用暑假到牧区体验生活
    内蒙古畜牧兽医学院的师生利用暑假到草原上体验生活。内蒙古畜牧兽医学院的学生，来自全国各地，他们大多数都没有见过草原，所以对利用暑假到草原上去都有很大兴趣。该学院的师生们，已于六月下旬分成两队，到呼纳盟草原和察哈尔盟草原上去。学生们计划在草原上，将着重了解牧区牲畜的饲养管理、草原管理和牲畜的疾病等情况，去呼纳盟的三、四年级同学还要帮助政府做好牲畜防疫工作。
    大家在出发前，除积极准备了有关材料、仪器等实习工具外，还热烈讨论了怎样搞好群众关系、怎样尊重少数民族风俗习惯等问题，有的同学还抓紧时间练习了蒙古舞等文化娱乐节目，准备和牧民们进行联欢。
