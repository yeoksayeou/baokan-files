Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 29th: The Standing Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor has issued a resolution passed at its recent meeting. The resolution states: The parliamentary elections of June 7th prove that the strength of the working people and the progressive strata of the people have greatly developed; this election is a victory for the Italian General Confederation of Labor and its policy based on the close alliance of the working class, the working people, and the middle strata. ...

The working class and the entire people demand the adoption of the following political and social measures:

	(1) Rationally distribute national income, greatly increase workers' wages, pensions, and social insurance and subsidies for the working people, and balance wage scales for various types of labor to guarantee and improve the living standards of residents.

	(2) Implement a new system of social relations in production departments, institutions, farms, and agricultural enterprises. Immediately stop all arbitrary actions and repressions by capitalists, and immediately stop any political persecution and discrimination; trade union freedom, the right to strike, and all democratic rights must be recognized and fully respected. …

	(3) Italy should actively participate in the broad world peace movement and work to defend peace, ease international tensions, promote economic and cultural cooperation between countries, peacefully resolve all differences, and stop the "Cold War" and political and racial discrimination.

	(4) Abandon the current policies that lead to recession. Overcome the backwardness of agriculture formed over generations. The solution is to implement land reform and make corresponding investments in agriculture to greatly increase agricultural income and increase agricultural employment. Make Italian industry serve the people, demanding productive peaceful investment and increased consumption; reorganize and strengthen important sectors of the Italian economy, such as the electricity industry, the chemical industry, and the major enterprises under the "Italian Industrial Reconstruction Institute" under state jurisdiction, by means of nationalization and effective industrialization of economically backward regions. Take advantage of new situations in international trade, carry out economically beneficial trade with Eastern European countries, China, and the entire East, and implement a policy of concluding trade agreements with all countries on an equal footing.

The resolution finally emphasizes that in order to make the Italian General Confederation of Labor a more powerful tool for uniting the masses and fighting to protect the bread and rights of Italian workers, it is also necessary to strengthen the organization.
