Our Great Motherland

    In order to strengthen the connection between the pastoral areas of western Inner Mongolia and the interior, and to prosper and improve the economic and cultural life of the people of Inner Mongolia, the state-owned Xilingol League and Chahar League Transportation Company of Inner Mongolia added long-distance buses from July 11, traveling back and forth on the 1,500-li sparsely populated grasslands between Zhangjiakou and Beizi Temple in the Xilingol League of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This is a scene of decorated new cars arriving at Beizi Temple and being welcomed by many herdsmen.
