Xinhua News Agency Report: The Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea sent a performing arts troupe to North Korea to express their sympathy and perform at the front lines. The performances were warmly welcomed by the broad commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

	For more than three months, the male and female actors of the performing arts troupe crossed mountains and charged through artillery blockade zones to perform many wonderful programs for the soldiers on the front-line stages, plazas, and in tunnels. The actors also visited many heroic companies, hospitals, anti-aircraft artillery positions, and agencies, and held symposiums with combat heroes and people's meritorious workers. The actors also saw off the troops participating in combat before the battle, and after the battle, they comforted the participating troops and congratulated the meritorious workers.

	In the past three months, the first troupe of the performing arts troupe has performed more than 600 shows for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops and the Korean people in various places on the front lines. The actors showed great enthusiasm in the performance activities. The patriotic artist Chang Xiangyu once vomited while performing, but after taking the medicine, she still insisted on finishing the play seriously. Yang Juping, a famous Peking Opera actress, twisted her foot, but she still insisted on performing. Gu Bonian, an actor nearly fifty years old, in addition to participating in collective performances, also went deep into the wards and kitchens to perform single-string storytelling, regardless of fatigue. Zhang Chunhua, a famous Peking Opera actress who won the first prize in the National Opera Observation and Performance Conference, insisted on finishing the play once when she was ill. Chang Baohua, the younger brother of the martyr Chang Baokun, enthusiastically told comic dialogues to the soldiers on the front line. Some of the actors of the fourth troupe of the performing arts troupe performed for more than two hours in the rain for an anti-aircraft machine gun company that shot down two enemy planes. Another part of the actors also rushed through the enemy's artillery blockade and arrived at Shangganling and the "Dingzi Mountain" position to pay tribute to the commanders and fighters guarding the position on behalf of the people of the motherland.

	The wonderful performances and enthusiastic condolences of the performing arts troupe powerfully encouraged the strong will of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers to defend the motherland and defend peace. When the sixth troupe of the performing arts troupe went to a field hospital of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to express their sympathy and perform, many lightly wounded soldiers excitedly jumped out of the wards and held the actors' hands for a long time. Before the battle to counterattack an unknown highland, a squad leader held the red flag presented by the performing arts troupe at the oath-taking meeting and said: "I will definitely plant the red flag on the enemy's position to answer the people of the motherland!" In the battle, he bravely planted the red flag on the top of the mountain.

	The actors performing on the front lines were warmly welcomed and kindly taken care of by the soldiers. A squad of soldiers, upon hearing that the actors of the performing arts troupe were coming to their troops to perform, carefully protected a cluster of wild flowers that survived the artillery fire on the top of the mountain, preparing to dedicate them to the actors. Many soldiers gave the actors handkerchiefs made of enemy parachute cloth, rice spoons and chopsticks made of enemy plane wreckage, etc., as souvenirs. A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also used enemy flare tubes and parachute cloth to make two waist drums and clothes for playing the waist drums, and presented them to the sixth troupe of the performing arts troupe. The performing arts troupe also received many enthusiastic letters from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. The first troupe of the performing arts troupe received more than 5,000 thank-you letters and letters of determination.

    赴朝慰问文艺工作团在前线进行慰问演出
    受到志愿军广大指挥员和战斗员热烈欢迎
    据新华社讯：中国人民抗美援朝总会赴朝慰问文艺工作团在朝鲜前线进行慰问演出，受到中国人民志愿军广大指挥员、战斗员的热烈欢迎。
    三个多月来，赴朝慰问文艺工作团的男女演员们越过高山，冲过炮火封锁区，在前线的舞台、广场和坑道里为战士们演出了许多精彩的节目。演员们还访问了许多英雄连队、医院、高射炮阵地和机关，和战斗英雄、人民功臣举行了座谈会；演员们还曾在战斗前给参加战斗的部队送行，在战斗结束后慰问参战部队并给功臣们贺功。
    赴朝慰问文艺工作团第一团三个多月来在前线各地先后为中国人民志愿军部队和朝鲜人民演出六百多场。演员们在慰问演出活动中表现了高度的热情。爱国艺人常香玉有一次在演出时呕吐了，她吃完药之后，仍认真地坚持着把戏演完。京剧名演员杨菊苹的脚扭坏了，仍一直坚持演出。年近五十岁的演员顾伯年除了参加集体演出以外，还不顾疲劳地深入病房和炊事班演出单弦拉戏。在全国戏曲观摩演出大会上荣获一等奖的京剧名演员张春华，有一次病了仍坚持把戏演完。烈士常宝堃的弟弟常宝华在前线热情地给战士们说相声。赴朝慰问文艺工作团第四团的一部分演员们冒雨为击落两架敌机的某高射机枪连演出两个多小时，另一部分演员还冲过敌人的炮火封锁，到达上甘岭和“丁字山”阵地，代表祖国人民向守卫在阵地上的指挥员战斗员们致敬。
    赴朝慰问文艺工作团的精彩表演和热情慰问，有力地鼓舞了中国人民志愿军战士保卫祖国保卫和平的坚强意志。赴朝慰问文艺工作团第六团到中国人民志愿军某战地医院进行慰问演出时，许多轻伤员们兴奋地跃出病房握住演员们的手久久不放。在反击某无名高地的战斗前，一个班长在宣誓大会上手执赴朝慰问文艺工作团赠送的红旗说：“我一定把红旗插上敌人的阵地，来回答祖国人民！”在战斗中他果然英勇地把红旗插上了山顶。
    在前线进行慰问演出的演员们受到战士们热烈的欢迎和亲切的照顾。有一个班的战士听说赴朝慰问文艺工作团的演员们将要到他们部队里来作慰问演出时，就把山头上在炮火下幸存的一簇野花细心地保护起来，准备献给演员们。许多战士把用缴获敌人的降落伞布做成的手帕、敌机残骸制成的饭勺、筷子等赠给演员们作纪念。中国人民志愿军某部还用缴获敌人的照明弹筒和降落伞布做成两个腰鼓和打腰鼓穿的衣服赠送给赴朝慰问文艺工作团第六团。赴朝慰问文艺工作团还收到许多封中国人民志愿军战士写的热情的来信，赴朝慰问文艺工作团第一团就收到了五千多封感谢信和决心书。
