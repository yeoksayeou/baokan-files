    Watching a Drama Performance in Prague
    Lao She

    I had wanted to go to Prague for more than just a day. From pictures and history books, I have long known that Prague is a famous city with a high degree of culture, ancient history, and beautiful scenery and architecture.
    This year, I got the chance to fulfill my wish.
    Prague is especially beautiful in the spring; how fortunate that I arrived right at the time of Prague Spring, when all flowers are in full bloom! I arrived there on April 21st.
    The surrounding hills are all green, and, when I arrived, they were the special fresh green of spring. This bright and tender fresh green, when stirred by a breeze, seemed to flow downwards, into the Vltava River that runs through the ancient city; what beautiful reflections! Yes, a river in the middle, surrounded by green hills, and between the hills and the river, generations of people have created all kinds of beautiful buildings and gardens. This is Prague. The entire city of Prague is a large garden.
    There are flowers everywhere. White and purple lilacs are especially numerous. Wherever you go, there are flowers; spring seems unwilling to let people forget it for a moment.
    Those beautiful buildings are as attractive as the flowers. Each ancient building has its own style and history; and just like the flowers and trees, the different colors and postures do not make people feel disharmonious. Looking from a high place, Prague has hundreds of church spires, stretching into the blue sky, their styles and patterns are different, but it is precisely because they are different from each other that they complement each other.
    However, I cannot continue to say this, although it is my honor to praise Prague. My task there was to watch plays. Well, please allow me to "get back to the point."
    I went to participate in the observation of the Czechoslovak National Professional Theater Troupe's performance conference held in Prague. The original name of the performance conference was "Drama Harvest," which means harvesting crops. I will still use "performance conference," it is more common for us, isn't it?
    The performance conference lasted for twenty days, from April 11th to 30th. We (Comrade Luo Wen who went with me) received the notice late, so we did not arrive in Prague until the 21st, and only saw eight plays in total. After the conference, we still tried to go to various theaters to watch plays to make up for the deficiency.
    The drama performance conference is a product of the February Revolution in 1948. Under the wise leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and leader Gottwald, the broad working class and the people of the whole country rose up to fight and won a decisive victory—defeating the traitors who wanted to restore the capitalist system and consolidating the bright road towards socialism. The drama workers also achieved a victory—the art of drama would never again be controlled by business and speculators, and everyone could happily and freely use drama as a good tool to educate the masses and serve the people. Mutual observation and common progress is everyone's wish. The drama performance conference was born from this. This year's performance conference is the fifth since 1948.
    The purpose of this performance conference is:
    From the perspective of the ideological content of the programs: the slogan of this performance conference is "Czechoslovak drama is fighting to defend peace and build socialism." Defending peace and building socialism are the wishes of the people of the whole country, and the activities of the drama circles are in line with this, using drama to educate and encourage the people to optimistically shoulder this glorious task, and to hate the enemies and American imperialism; advocating socialist patriotism, and opposing harmful cosmopolitanism and petty-bourgeois narrow nationalism. The performance conference is not only a technical observation and competition, but also has a major political purpose.
    From an artistic point of view: the artistic level of drama in big cities is higher than that in small cities and remote areas. The purpose of the performance conference is to universally improve the level of drama art through mutual observation, criticism, mutual assistance.
    Another purpose of the performance conference is to perform several famous Soviet dramas and learn from the Soviet Union.
    Because we were late, we only saw eight plays in the performance conference. These eight plays are: Hikmet's "Turkish Story," a drama, performed by the Prague Military Art Theater. Won first prize. Soviet Kabanievsky (Stalin Prize winner)'s "The Taras Family," an opera, performed by the Olomouc Regional Theater. Won a prize. Fadeyev's "The Young Guard," a drama, performed by the Beskydy Theater of Nový Jičín (small city). Won third prize. Soviet Mukhtarov's "Family Honor," a drama, the content is similar to our "Three-Anti" campaign, performed by the Nitra Regional Theater. Commended. Smetana's "The Bartered Bride," a classical opera, performed by the Prague National Theater. Soviet Lavrenyov's "The Turning Point," a drama, performed by the Czechoslovak Military Theater. Won first prize. A ballet adapted from Pushkin's "The Fountain of Bakhchisarai," performed by the Bratislava National Theater. Tyl's "The Obstinate Woman," a classical drama, performed by the Prague National Theater.
    After the performance conference, we also watched several plays—some of which were programs that had participated in the performance conference, and some were not.
    Drama: "Hot Porridge": A trial performance at the Little Theater (the script still needs to be revised), a work by a young writer. "The Strike in Most": Performed by the Prague Reality Theater. Author: Zacchi. Participated in the performance conference and received commendation. Had previously won a national award. "Mother": Performed by the Prague Military Art Theater. Author: Capek. Puppet Show: "The Little Duck": Performed by the Prague Central Puppet Theater. Opera: "The Whirlpool": Performed by the Bratislava National Theater, a new opera by Eugen Suchoň, which won the National Prize in 1951. Song and Dance: Youth Song and Dance: Performed at the Bratislava National Theater.
    We only saw fourteen programs. Based on these alone, we cannot see the overall achievements of the Czechoslovak drama movement. However, in addition to watching plays, we also constantly visited and learned some situations.
    Czechoslovak drama, whether it is drama, opera, or puppet show, has a fairly long and beautiful tradition. This tradition is not only national, but also national revolutionary. From 1620, the Czechs lost their independence for three centuries; during this period, they suffered all kinds of oppression from Germany and Hungary. Striving for national independence was the common will of the people. At the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Czech Renaissance movement arose. The ruling class was determined to make the ruled forget the glory of history, forget their own language and culture. However, first, Palacký (1798-1876) wrote his own national history. Cherishing one's own national language was also an important movement during this period. The female writer Němcová (1820-1862) created the novel "The Grandmother," which laid the foundation for the literature that expressed the real life of the Czech nation.
    The Renaissance movement reached its climax with the Revolution of 1848. Great artists, of drama, opera, poetry and prose, music, and art, emerged one after another, serving the revival and development of national culture.
    The drama movement was led by Tyl. He was a playwright, actor, drama theorist and organizer, journalist and politician. His ideal was the ideal of the people, and his plays reflected the demands of the people. He created a national drama program; he said: "Drama is life." This performance conference was held in the theater named after him, and the last program was his play "The Obstinate Woman." In this play, he described the spirit of young people striving for freedom. The revolutionary tradition has never been interrupted, and it has been further developed today.
    The same is true for opera. The name of Smetana (1824-1884) is known all over the world. His "The Bartered Bride" is a Czechoslovak people's all-time favorite—this time it was performed again by the National Theater. The music, dance, costumes, and language here are all national.
    In 1886, the people donated money to build the National Theater. Previously, the theaters were all German; the people wanted their own theater. Tyl supplied the drama, Smetana supplied the opera, and the great painter Aleš led the painting. This is not just a theater, but a bastion of national consciousness. Tyl said it well: "The theater should be the flowering and outpouring of the nation itself, born from the blood of the native land, and returning to the blood of the native land."
    The Czechoslovak people love drama and are proud of their national drama tradition. In this performance conference, the people saw new creations and also saw classical works. The history of national revolution and the tradition of national drama closely linked the old and the new. Taking the National Theater alone, sixty years ago, the people donated one penny at a time to build it; today, the people have become the masters of everything; who can come here to watch the play without feeling the glory of history and the present!
    Now, all the professional theater troupes in the country have been changed to state-owned, and all the professional drama workers have been taken care of by the government. Before liberation, there were only eighteen regularly working theaters in the country, now there are fifty-two—many of which include several troupes (drama, opera, ballet, etc.), calculated by troupe, it has reached one hundred. The distribution of theaters has spread throughout the country. For remote rural areas, rural theaters are organized to tour and perform in various places. Drama has truly penetrated into the folk.
    Before liberation, only 30 million crowns were spent on drama in the national budget. By 1952, it had increased to 660 million. Now, the best seats in the theaters prepared for young people cost only ten crowns, even though the expenses are very large. That is to say, the ticket price only accounts for two thousandths of the average monthly salary of a worker. Fifteen crowns can get a seat in the National Theater.
    Except for a short break in the summer, all professional theater troupes perform all year round. Generally speaking, each program can always be performed for 20 consecutive shows, and particularly good shows can be performed hundreds of times in a few years. Large theaters have established a repertoire and often perform in rotation. The best of these programs can last for several years.
    Now that the working conditions of drama workers are available and their lives are stable, they can devote themselves wholeheartedly to studying their business and improving their level. The Party and the government often lead them so that their talents can be fully developed and dedicated to the work of improving national culture. The Party does not issue orders to force or prohibit anything, but adopts the method of persuasion and demonstration to enable drama workers to automatically strive for progress.
    With the above explanation, we can clearly see that the national drama performance conference, whether viewed from the tradition of national literature and art or from today's construction of the socialist system, has its great significance and is needed by the people.
    Now, I will talk about my feelings about the performance conference:
    I. This performance conference, with the slogan of "fighting to defend peace and build socialism," is a wise decision. The importance of these two major themes needs no explanation. However, there are not enough plays with these two major themes as content. This performance conference undoubtedly educated the people and gave playwrights enlightenment.
    II. Eight of the twenty programs of the performance conference are Soviet works (including classical works, such as Gogol's "The Inspector General"). This enthusiastic attitude of learning from the Soviet Union is consistent with us.
    III. Because the types of plays in the performance conference included dramas, operas, ballets, puppet shows, etc., and because two Czech classical operas, one Czech classical drama, and Hikmet's "Turkish Story" were performed, we felt that the newly created dramas and operas seemed to be a little less. When we visited, we heard that the Czechoslovak government is arranging some necessary topics related to real life for writers, giving writers a considerable amount of time and all kinds of convenience, hoping that they can complete several new scripts this year.
    IV. The new opera "The Whirlpool," which we saw and which expresses modern life, is something that the Slovak drama circles are proud of. The music in the play is very good. With the power of music, the audience was greatly moved. This shows the importance of music in opera, which deserves our attention—there is no need to shy away from the fact that the music in our song and dance dramas ("old" plays) is quite simple. At the same time, in this new creation, most of the characters wear national costumes. Because of the beauty of this costume, we do not feel that there is any disharmony between the modern characters and the opera form. However, some characters wearing work uniforms and smoking cigarettes seem to detract from the unity of the overall plot tone. This also deserves our attention. In our operas that express modern life, we often adopt naturalism, so that the appearance and costumes of the characters are not beautiful enough. A good opera must be artistically sufficient to satisfy the audience's ears and eyes, and the two are indispensable.
    Generally speaking, Western operas focus on singing music and often ignore actions and expressions; in large scenes, the "masses" always stand still, and sing when it is time to sing, as if they were machines. Both of these shortcomings have been corrected in this new work, and this is what they are all paying attention to correcting in their national operas.
    By the way: the creation of new operas is a very difficult task, but the Czechoslovak people have traditional national operas and now have newly created operas. We cannot but be proud of them for this; we should also strive for the creation of our own new operas, especially our musicians!
    Below are two things that we should especially learn from Czechoslovakia:
        I. Puppet Show: Puppet shows in Czechoslovakia have at least 300 years of history. In 1903, the first puppet show conference was held in Prague. The sixth conference was held in 1935. In 1912, the publication "Czech Puppet Show" was published. During the First World War, puppet shows, because of their convenient performances, played a good role in the front lines, prisoner-of-war camps, and hospitals. In 1929, the International Puppet Show Federation was established in Prague, with 14 countries participating. After that, the Slavic Puppet Show Federation was established in Prague. In this way, Czech puppet shows have long gained international status. Many countries learn from the Czech Republic. In 1936, there were more than 1,000 puppet show troupes in the country, performing 10,000 shows. In the Second World War, Czech puppet shows suffered great losses in equipment and talent; however, they were immediately revived after the end of the war. In 1948, puppet shows gained a decisive position, enjoying the same treatment as other stage arts, and having its representatives in the National Drama Conference. In the same year, Professor Skupa (puppet show expert) was given the title of National Artist. Puppet shows are also adapted into movies.
    From the above simple narrative, we can see that when we are building our own puppet shows, in addition to learning from the Soviet Union, we have the need to learn from Czechoslovakia. They have good experience in the history of puppet shows, stage design, music, the manufacture of puppets, the organization of puppet exhibitions, the filming of puppet movies, etc., which can be used for reference.
    We also visited the school that trains puppet show talents. We saw that students not only learn the skills of playing puppets, but also learn drama performance, dancing, music (each person must be able to sing and play at least one musical instrument), stage design, etc. Only people trained in this way can perform with puppets on stage and give performances to children. When it is time to dance, he will dance; when it is time to sing, he will sing; when it is time to recite poetry, he will recite. Children also sing and recite along. In this way, the stage and the audience can be integrated. Relying solely on puppet performances will definitely not have such an effect. It takes four years to train such an actor. We think this is worth learning.
    For puppet show script creation, writers and experts need to cooperate. In the puppet theater, there are many letters and drawings from children. From these, puppet show workers can understand what children need and love, which is an important reference for creating puppet shows. II. Rural Theater: The rural theater travels to remote rural areas all over the country to perform plays throughout the year. The entire theater has ten groups, seven groups go to the countryside, and three groups rehearse and prepare in the theater (in Prague). Each group has a truck that can accommodate seventeen people and props. Among the seventeen people, except for the driver and two stage workers, the remaining fourteen are actors. The stage equipment conditions in the countryside are not sufficient, so large plays cannot be performed. Therefore, the newly created touring scripts must require no more than twelve characters. Classical or foreign plays with many people must be adapted to suit rural performances.
    What is most worthy of our attention is that everything in the rural theater is planned, like a machine. Where each group goes, what plays to perform; when to return, and what plays to prepare for, are all implemented according to the plan; looking at the charts of the theater, the entire work is clear at a glance. Who says that artistic undertakings cannot be strictly managed with scientific methods? Unfortunately, a certain actor in a certain group fell ill on the way. As soon as the telegram arrived at the theater, someone was immediately sent by plane. If the sick person A is the protagonist, the people in his group have already prepared B who can replace him, and C who is rushed by plane can replace B. Every time they arrive in a place, the actors immediately contact the local Party committee and ask for instructions. After the instructions, the actors appropriately carry out current affairs propaganda in addition to performing plays. The application of this scientific management method to the management of artistic undertakings is particularly worthy of our learning.
    We not only saw beautiful Prague, but also saw beautiful drama performances there, increased our knowledge, and learned many new things. This is indeed our happiness, and we are grateful!
    Whether in Prague or elsewhere, we were warmly welcomed and sincerely entertained; here, we deeply realized the deep and beautiful friendship between democratic brother countries, and the great power of defending peace and building socialism that comes from this friendship.
    On May 23rd, we said goodbye to beautiful Prague. Holding the hands of the Czechoslovak people, we were reluctant to part with each other. Friends, your friendship has moved us and will never be forgotten. One of the roles of your drama performance conference is to strengthen the understanding of socialist internationalism. Please allow us to say this: we have been deeply educated by this internationalism!

    在布拉格观摩戏剧会演
    老舍
    我想到布拉格去已非一日了。从画片上和书史上，我久已知道布拉格是个有高度文化，古远的历史，和美丽的风景与建筑的名城。
    今年，我得到了如愿以偿的机会。
    布拉格在春天特别美；多么幸福，我正赶上百花齐放的布拉格之春！我是四月二十一日到了那里的。
    四围的小山都是绿的，而且，在我到达的时候，是春天特有的新绿。这鲜明柔嫩的新绿，若是被微风吹动，就彷佛要往下流，流到横贯古城的维尔塔发河里；多么美的倒影啊！是的，中间一条河，四围是绿的小山，在山河之间历代人民创造了各式各样美丽的建筑与花园，这就是布拉格。布拉格全城就是个大花园。
    到处都是花。白的紫的丁香特别多。到哪里，哪里有花，春仿佛一会儿不愿教人们忘记它。
    那些美丽的建筑，也跟花一样吸引着人。每一座古建筑都有它自己的风格与历史；而且正跟花木一样，不同的色彩与姿态并不使人感觉到不调谐。登高一望，布拉格有成百的教堂的楼尖，伸向碧空，它们的风格和式样都不同，但是也正因为彼此不同，才相得益彰。
    但是，我不能这样一直说下去，虽然赞颂布拉格是我的光荣。我到那里去的任务是看戏。好，请允许我“书归正传”吧。
    我是去参加观摩在布拉格举行的捷克斯洛伐克全国职业剧团的会演大会。会演大会的名称原系“戏剧收获”，就是收庄稼的意思。我还是用“会演”吧，对咱们较为通俗，不是吗？
    会演自四月十一日起，到三十日止，共二十天。我们（与我同去的还有骆文同志）接到通知已迟，所以在二十一日才赶到布拉格，一共只看到了八场戏。会后仍争取到各戏院去看戏，以补不足。
    戏剧会演是一九四八年二月革命的产物。二月革命，在捷克斯洛伐克的共产党与领袖哥特瓦尔德的英明领导下，广大的工人阶级与全国人民一致奋起斗争，得到决定的胜利——打退了要恢复资本主义制度的叛徒，巩固了走向社会主义的光明道路。戏剧工作者也因而得到了胜利——戏剧艺术永不再受生意经与投机者的控制，大家得以愉快地自由地以戏剧为教育群众的良好工具，为人民服务。互相观摩，共同进步，是大家的愿望。戏剧会演由此产生。今年的会演已是一九四八年后的第五次。
    此次会演的目的是：
    由节目的思想内容上说：此次会演的口号是“捷克斯洛伐克的戏剧是为保卫和平与建设社会主义而斗争的”。保卫和平与建设社会主义是全国人民的愿望，戏剧界的活动也就与此配合，用戏剧去教育并鼓舞人民乐观地担起这光荣任务，并憎恨敌人与美国帝国主义；倡导社会主义的爱国主义，反对那有害的世界主义与小资产阶级的狭隘的国家主义。会演不仅是技术的观摩与竞赛，而且具有重大的政治目的。
    由艺术上说：大城市的戏剧艺术水平高于小城市及偏僻的地方。会演的目的即在通过互相观摩，批评，互助，普遍地提高戏剧艺术的水平。
    会演的另一目的是演出几部苏联戏剧名著，向苏联学习。
    因为迟到，我们只看到了会演中的八场戏，这八场戏是：希克梅特的“土耳其故事”，话剧，布拉格部队艺术剧团演出。得一等奖。苏联卡巴涅夫斯基
    （斯大林奖金获得者）的“塔拉斯一家人”，歌剧，奥洛摩茨地方剧团演出。得奖。法捷耶夫的“青年近卫军”，话剧，诺维·依琴城（小城）别斯基士剧团演出。得三等奖。苏联穆赫塔路夫的“家庭的荣誉”，话剧，内容略似我们的“三反”，尼特拉地方剧团演出。表扬。司密丹纳的“被出卖的新娘”，古典歌剧，布拉格国家剧院演出。苏联拉夫阮聂夫的“转折”，话剧，捷克斯洛伐克部队剧团演出。得一等奖。依据普希金的“巴赫奇萨拉依水泉”改编的舞剧，布拉第斯拉瓦国家剧院演出。狄尔的“顽强的妇人”，古典话剧，布拉格国家剧院演出。
    在会演后，我们又看了几场戏——其中有的是参加过会演的节目，有的不是。
    话剧：“热粥”：小小剧场试演（剧本还须修正），一青年作家的作品。“莫斯特的罢工”：布拉格现实剧院演出。作者：萨赤。参加会演，得到表扬。以前已得过国家奖励。“母亲”：布拉格部队艺术剧团演出。作者：卡别克。傀儡戏：“小鸭子”：布拉格中央傀儡剧院演出。歌剧：“漩涡”：布拉第斯拉瓦国家剧院演出，是尤金·苏霍依的新歌剧，一九五一年获得国家奖。歌舞：青年歌舞：在布拉第斯拉瓦国家剧场演出。
    我们只看到十四个节目，专凭这一些，我们无从看到捷克斯洛伐克戏剧运动的全面成就。但是，在看戏而外，我们还不断地去访问，才了解了一些情况。
    捷克斯洛伐克的戏剧，无论是话剧、歌剧，还是傀儡戏，都有相当长久的优美传统。这个传统不仅是民族的，而且是民族革命的。从一六二○年起，捷克失去了三个世纪的独立；在这期间受尽德国与匈牙利的压迫。争取民族独立是人民的共同意志。在十八世纪之末与十九世纪初，捷克文艺复兴运动兴起。统治阶级一心要使被统治者忘掉历史的光荣，忘掉自己的语言与文化。可是，首先，巴拉斯基（一七九八——一八七六）写了自己的民族历史。珍视自己民族的语言也是这时期的重要运动。女作家奈姆磋娃（一八二○——一八六二）创作了小说“祖母”，奠定了表现捷克民族现实生活的文艺。
    文艺复兴运动随着一八四八年革命到了高潮，大艺术家们，话剧的，歌剧的，诗与散文的，音乐的，美术的，相继而起，服务于民族文化的复兴与发展。
    话剧运动以狄尔为首。他是剧作者，演员，戏剧理论者与组织者，记者与政治家。他的理想是人民的理想，他的剧作反映了人民的要求。他创立了民族话剧节目；他说：“戏剧就是生命”。此次会演就在以他的名字命名的剧场中举行，而末一个节目，也就演的是他的戏——“顽强的妇人”。在这戏里，他描写了青年争取自由的奋斗精神。革命的传统一直没有断绝，而且在今天更发扬光大了。
    歌剧也是如此。司密丹纳（一八二四——一八八四）的名字是举世皆知的。他的“被出卖的新娘”是捷克斯洛伐克人民百观不厌的——这次会演又由国家剧院演出。这里的音乐、舞蹈、服装、言语，都是民族自己的。
    一八八六年，人民献金修建国家剧场。以前，剧场都是德国人的；人民要一个自己的剧场。狄尔供给了话剧，司密丹纳供给了歌剧，大画家阿理士领导绘画。这不仅是个剧场，而是民族自觉的堡垒。狄尔说得好：“剧院应当是民族本身的开花与倾诉，生自本土的血中，归于本土的血中”。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱戏剧，对民族的戏剧传统都引以自豪。在这次会演中，人民看到新的创作，也看到古典的作品，这新旧之间却被民族革命的历史与民族戏剧的传统亲切地联系到一处。单以国家剧场来说，在六十年前，人民一文钱一文钱地捐献，修筑了它；在今天，人民已作了一切的主人；到这里来看戏的，谁能不感到历史的与眼前的光荣呢！
    现在，全国所有的职业剧团已都改为国有，所有的职业戏剧工作者都得到政府的照顾。在解放前，全国只有十八个经常工作的剧院，现在已有五十二个——其中有许多包括好几个团（话剧、歌剧、舞剧等），按照团来算，已经到一百个了。剧院的分配，普及全国各地。对偏僻的农村，另组织了乡村剧院，到各地巡回演出。戏剧真深入了民间。
    在解放前，国家预算中花费在戏剧上的只有三千万克朗。到一九五二年，已增加到六亿六千万。现在，为青年预备的剧院，开销虽很大，可是最好的座位的票价只是十个克朗。这就是说，票价只占一个工人平均月薪的千分之二。花十五个克朗可以在国家剧场获得一个座位。
    除了暑天作短期的休息，一切职业剧团都作终年的演出。一般地说，每个节目总可以连演二十场，特别好的戏可在数年之间演出几百场。大的剧院都建立了保留节目，经常轮流演出。其中最好的节目可以继持若干年。
    戏剧工作者的工作条件既已具备，生活既已安定，他们就能全心全意地钻研业务，提高水平。党与政府经常领导他们，使他们的才能得以尽量发挥，致力于提高民族文化的工作。党并不发号施令去强迫什么或禁止什么，而是采取说服与示范的方法，使戏剧工作者自动地争取前进。
    有了上边的说明，我们可以清楚地看到，全国戏剧会演，无论是从民族文艺的传统来看，还是从今天的建设社会主义制度来看，都有它的重大意义，都是人民所需要的。
    现在，我谈谈对会演的感想：
    一、这次会演，以“为保卫和平与建设社会主义而斗争”为号召，是个英明的决定。这两大主题的重要，无须解释。可是以这两大主题为内容的剧作还不够多，这次会演无疑地教育了人民，也给剧作者以启示。
    二、会演的二十个节目中有八个是苏联的作品
    （包括古典作品，如果戈理的“巡按”），这种热诚向苏联学习的态度是与我们一致的。
    三、会演的剧种因包括了话剧 、歌剧、舞剧、傀儡戏等，又因演出了两个捷克的古典歌剧，一个捷克的古典话剧，和希克梅特的“土耳其故事”，所以我们感到新创作的话剧与歌剧似乎少了一点。在我们去访问的时候，我们听到：捷克斯洛伐克政府正给作家们布置一些必要的有关现实生活的题目，给作家们以相当长的时间和一切便利，希望他们在今年能完成几个新剧本。
    四、我们看到的一个表现现代生活的新歌剧“漩涡”，是斯洛伐克戏剧界引以为荣的。剧中的音乐很好。凭音乐的力量，观众们受到很大的感动。这说明了歌剧中音乐的重要性，值得我们注意——不必讳言，我们的歌舞剧（“旧”戏）中的音乐是相当简陋的。同时，在这个新创作里，多数角色穿着民族服装，因这种服装的美丽，我们并不感到现代人物与歌剧形式有什么不调谐。可是，有的角色穿着工作制服，吸着烟卷，便觉得稍有损于全剧情调的统一。这也值得我们注意。我们的表现现代生活的歌剧中，往往采取自然主义，以致人物的形相及服装都不够美好。一出好歌剧在艺术性上是要足以满足观众的耳和眼的，二者不可缺一。
    一般地说，西洋歌剧以歌唱音乐为主，往往忽略了动作与表情；在大场面中，“群众”总是呆立，到唱的时候就唱，好像是机器。这两个缺点，在这个新作中都已矫正了，而且这也是他们全国歌剧都正在注意矫正的。
    附带着说：新歌剧的创作是十分困难的事，可是捷克斯洛伐克人民既有传统的民族歌剧，现在又有了新创的歌剧，我们不能不因此而为他们骄傲；我们也该努力于自己的新歌剧的创作，特别是我们的音乐家们！
    下边提出我们特别该向捷克斯洛伐克学习的两件事：
        一、傀儡戏：捷克斯洛伐克的傀儡戏至少已有三百年的历史。一九○三年，在布拉格举行第一次傀儡戏大会。第六次大会是在一九三五年举行的。一九一二年，出版“捷克傀儡戏”刊物，在第一次世界大战中，傀儡戏，因为演出方便，在前线、俘虏营、医院，都起了很好的作用。一九二九年，在布拉格成立了国际傀儡戏联合会，参加的有十四国。此后，布拉格又成立了斯拉夫傀儡戏联合会。这样，捷克的傀儡戏早已取得国际地位。有许多国家向捷克学习。在一九三六年，全国已有一千多个傀儡戏团，演出了一万场。在二次大战中，捷克傀儡戏，在设备上，人才上，都受了很大的损失；可是，大战结束，马上又复兴起来。一九四八年，傀儡戏得到决定的地位，它和别的舞台艺术享有同等的待遇，在国家戏剧会议中有它的代表。同年，司古巴教授
    （傀儡戏专家）得到国家艺术家的尊称。傀儡戏也改编为电影。
    由上面的简单叙述，我们看出来，当我们建设自己的傀儡戏的时候，在向苏联学习而外，我们有向捷克斯洛伐克学习的必要。对傀儡戏历史，舞台装置，音乐，傀儡的制造，傀儡展览会的组织，傀儡电影的拍摄等等方面，他们都有很好的经验，可资参考。
    我们也到训练傀儡戏人才的学校参观过。我们看到：学生并不仅学耍傀儡的技巧，而且还要学戏剧表演，跳舞，音乐（每人至少须会唱，会奏一种乐器），舞台装置等等。这样训练出来的人，才能与傀儡同台，给儿童表演。到舞的时候，他会舞；到唱的时候，他会唱；到朗诵诗词的时候，他会朗诵。儿童们也随着唱，朗诵。这样，台上台下才能打成一片。单靠傀儡表演，一定不会有这样的效果。训练这样一个演员，需要四年的工夫。我们觉得这是值得学习的。
    对傀儡戏剧本创作，作家与专家有合作的必要。在傀儡剧场中，贴着许多儿童们来的信与图画。由这些，傀儡戏工作者可以了解儿童们需要什么，喜爱什么，为创作傀儡戏的重要参考。　二、乡村剧院：乡村剧院终年到全国各处偏僻的农村去演戏。全院有十组，七组下乡，三组在院部（在布拉格）排戏，准备。每组有一辆卡车，足容十七人与导具。十七人中除了司机与舞台工作者二人，其余的十四人是演员。乡村的舞台设备条件不够，所以不能演大戏。因此，新创作的巡回演出的剧本，必求人物不超过十二人。用人多的古典戏或外国戏必须改编过，以适合乡村的演出。
    最值得我们注意的是乡村剧院的一切都是有计划的，好像一盘机器。各组到哪里去，演什么戏；几时回来，再准备什么戏，都按照计划实行；一看院部的图表，全部工作便一目了然。谁说艺术事业不能严格地用科学方法管理呢？不幸，某组的某演员在途中生了病，电报一到院部，即马上派人乘飞机赶去。生病的甲若是主角，他的本组人早已准备好能替代他的乙，而乘飞机赶去的丙即可代乙。每到一地，演员们即与本地的党委联系，请给指示。指示之后，演员在演戏之外，适当地作时事宣传。这种科学管理方法的应用于艺术事业管理上，是特别值得我们学习的。
    我们不但看见了美丽的布拉格，而且在那里看到了美丽的戏剧会演，增长了见识，学习了许多新东西，这的确是我们的幸福，我们感谢！
    不管是在布拉格，还是在别处，我们都受到热烈的欢迎与诚恳的招待；于此，我们深刻地体会到民主兄弟国家间的深厚而美丽的友谊，和由这友谊而来的保卫和平与建设社会主义的伟大力量。
    五月二十三日我们与美丽的布拉格告别。握着捷克斯洛伐克人民的手，彼此依依不舍。朋友们，你们的友谊使我们感动，永久难忘。你们的戏剧会演的作用之一是加强对社会主义的国际主义的认识，请允许我们这样说吧：我们深深地受到这种国际主义的教育！
