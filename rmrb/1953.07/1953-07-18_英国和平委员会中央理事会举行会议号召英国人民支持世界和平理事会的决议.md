Xinhua News Agency, London, July 15th: TASS reports that the newly elected Central Council of the British Peace Committee, from the Manchester Peace Action Congress, recently held a meeting in London.

The British Peace Committee, in a statement released on July 14th, said that the Central Council decided to issue a call to all Peace Committees in Britain, urging them to participate together in a movement to support the appeal adopted by the Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council to strive for immediate Great Power consultations.

The Central Council also decided to write to the British government, urging it to pay attention to the appeal of the World Peace Council, and to request the British government to support Nehru's proposal to convene the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Korean situation, and to propose a date and location for Great Power talks.

According to reports from the Central Council meeting, in the past six weeks, more than 30,000 people have signed petitions to Members of Parliament requesting Great Power consultations. Many regions in Britain have elected representatives to meet with Members of Parliament.

The appeal issued to all national Peace Committees pointed out: The people of the world and many governments have clearly expressed their hope that the leaders of the Great Powers will hold talks, but this wish has not yet been realized. Certain groups, especially the American group, are using every excuse to block the road to this meeting, keeping the world in a state of bewilderment, tension, and fear. The appeal calls on the British people to support the World Peace Council's call for immediate Great Power consultations, to act more forcefully than ever before, and to launch a movement for the greatest action for peace that Britain has ever seen.

    英国和平委员会中央理事会举行会议号召英国人民支持世界和平理事会的决议
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：在曼彻斯特和平行动大会上新选出来的英国和平委员会中央理事会于日前在伦敦召开会议。
    英国和平委员会在七月十四日公布的声明说，中央理事会决定向全英国所有的和平委员会发出号召，要求它们一起参加到一个运动里，支持世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议所通过的争取立刻举行大国协商的号召。
    中央理事会也决定致函英国政府，促使它注意世界和平理事会的呼吁，并要求英国政府支持尼赫鲁的建议，召开联合国大会以便讨论朝鲜局势，并提出举行大国会谈的日期和地点。
    根据中央理事会会议上的报告，在过去六星期中，已有三万多人在致议会议员要求举行大国协商的呼吁书上签了名。英国许多地区已推选出代表去见议会议员。
    对全国各和平委员会发出的呼吁书指出：全世界人民和许多政府都曾明白表示，希望大国领袖们举行会谈，可是这个愿望至今还未实现。某些集团，特别是美国集团正利用一切藉口来阻挡走向这一会议的道路，使这世界继续处于彷徨、紧张和恐惧之中。呼吁书号召英国人民支持世界和平理事会要求立即举行大国协商的号召。比以前更有力地行动起来，发动一次英国所从来不曾有过的最巨大的争取和平行动的运动。
