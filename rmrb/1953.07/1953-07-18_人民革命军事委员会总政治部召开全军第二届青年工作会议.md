Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government convened the Second All-Army Youth Work Conference from July 6th to 11th. The conference was attended by youth work cadres from major military regions, various special forces, and directly subordinate organs of the Military Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Youth work cadres from the Chinese People's Volunteers were also invited to participate. The purpose of this conference was to summarize youth work in the military based on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong on the Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, as well as the resolutions of the Second National Congress of the Youth League, and to discuss and determine the future tasks of the Youth League in the military.

Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Secretary Hu Yaobang of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League attended the first day of the conference and were warmly welcomed by all the cadres present.

The cadres present listened to and discussed the report by Wang Zonghuai, Director of the Youth Department of the General Political Department, on "Summary of Youth Work in the Military in the Past Two Years and Future Tasks," and exchanged typical work experiences. After discussion, the cadres present unanimously agreed that: in the current regular training of the military, under the leadership of the Party and political organs, the Youth League organization must continuously and effectively carry out its work, mobilize and organize League members and the broad masses of young people to exert a high degree of learning enthusiasm, so that they can quickly master and become proficient in modern military technology; assist the Party and commanders in carrying out various teaching tasks, educate League members and the broad masses of young people to exemplarily implement and maintain various regulations and teaching materials of the military, carefully cherish weapons and equipment, and actively participate in club work, so that the Youth League becomes a powerful assistant to the Party and commanders in implementing military, political, and cultural education, consolidating discipline, and improving combat effectiveness in the military.

Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, made a report at the conference on "Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Youth Work in the Military." He said: The reason why the Youth League work in the military has been able to achieve such brilliant results in the short span of two or three years is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party. Two of the most important experiences gained in these two or three years are: affirming the necessity and great significance of establishing the Youth League in the military; enriching and developing the Party's experience in leading the Youth League. Deputy Director Fu Zhong also pointed out: Party committees and political organs at all levels in the military must deeply recognize the important significance of the Youth League as a capable assistant to the Party and an important reserve force of the Party. The Party should guide all activities of the Youth League and pass on various work experiences to them. Political organs at all levels should discuss the work of the League, frequently listen to the League's opinions on leadership to improve the leadership work; concretely and proactively help the League solve difficulties in its work, promptly approve the League's work plans, forward various advanced work experiences of the League, and check on the leadership of the Party committees at lower levels over the League; at the same time, they should be good at bringing into play the organizational role of the League, take into account the characteristics and accumulated experience of youth work, and not only assign a few youth work cadres to participate in the general work of the Party while leaving the entire organization of the League aside. Party committees at all levels must learn to do League work from practice, actively lead and study the work of the League, and proactively check and summarize the work experience of the League. Party committees and political organs at all levels should also be good at grasping the characteristics of young people and the laws of youth work, and be good at using detailed and patient methods of persuasion to educate and inspire the enthusiasm, consciousness, and creativity of young people. Party committees and political organs at all levels must use their greatest efforts to lead all young people in the military to solve the problem of combining learning and work. Deputy Director Fu Zhong emphasized: Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions to the Second National Congress of the Youth League are the future direction of youth work in the military, and also the fundamental method for young people in the military to carry out learning. The important responsibility of the Party in leading the Youth League lies in education, and the focus of the League's work lies in learning.

The conference was concluded by the moderator. The summary pointed out that: according to Chairman Mao's instructions to the Second National Congress of the Youth League, the main shortcoming of our youth work in the military is that we are not good at carrying out work according to the characteristics of young people. Youth work cadres in the military should follow Chairman Mao's instructions to make the youth in the military "healthy, study well, and work well." The Youth League should require young people to earnestly learn the regular courses of the military; and should patiently and earnestly teach young people to cultivate their good moral character. The Youth League should put forward different requirements for young people according to different services and different work positions, encourage them to be brave and progressive, and cultivate their organizational skills and discipline. The Youth League should require young people to develop good living habits, and at the same time, it should also enable them to happily carry out various recreational activities.

Through discussion, the cadres present clearly recognized that while completing the central tasks of the military, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of the Youth League's grassroots organizations and strengthen the construction of youth work departments at all levels. Youth workers must go deep into the military, deep into the League branches, and deep into the masses of young people to carry out the work of the League according to the tasks of the military and the characteristics of the young people in the military.

    人民革命军事委员会总政治部召开全军第二届青年工作会议
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部于七月六日至十一日召开了全军第二届青年工作会议。出席会议的有中国人民解放军各大军区、各特种兵和军委直属机关的青年工作干部，中国人民志愿军的青年工作干部也应邀参加。这次会议召开的目的是：根据中国共产党中央委员会和毛泽东主席对中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会的指示以及青年团第二次全国代表大会的决议来总结部队青年工作，讨论和确定青年团今后在部队中的任务。
    中国人民解放军朱德总司令和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会胡耀邦书记参加了第一天的会议，受到全体到会干部的热烈欢迎。
    到会干部听取和讨论了总政治部青年部部长王宗槐关于“两年来部队青年工作总结和今后任务”的报告，并互相介绍了典型工作经验。经讨论后    ，到会干部一致认为：在目前部队正规训练中，青年团组织在党和政治机关的领导下，必须不间断地有效地进行自己的工作，动员与组织团员及广大青年发挥高度的学习积极性，使他们迅速掌握与熟练现代军事技术；协助党和指挥员进行各项教学工作，教育团员和广大青年模范地执行并维护部队各种条令与教范，认真爱护武器装备，积极参加俱乐部工作，使青年团成为党和指挥员在部队中实施军事与政治文化教育、巩固纪律、提高战斗力的有力助手。
    总政治部副主任傅钟在会议上作了关于“加强部队党对青年工作的领导”的报告。他说：在短短的两三年中，部队青年团工作能够获得如此光辉的成绩主要是由于党的正确领导。在这两三年的工作中获得了两条最重要的经验，这就是：肯定了部队建立青年团的必要性和重大意义；丰富和发展了党对青年团领导的经验。傅钟副主任还指出：部队各级党委、政治机关必须深刻认识青年团是党的得力助手、是党的后备军的重要意义。党应该指导青年团的一切活动，并把各种工作经验传授给他们。各级政治机关要讨论团的工作，经常听取团对领导上的意见，来改进对团的领导工作；具体地、主动地帮助团解决工作中的困难，及时批示团的工作计划，转发团的各种先进的工作经验，检查下级党委对团的领导情况；同时要善于发挥团的组织作用，要照顾青年工作的特点和积累的经验，不要只顾分配少数青年工作干部去参加党的一般工作而把团的整个组织丢在一旁。各级党委必须从实践中提高和学会做团的工作，要积极领导和研究团的工作，主动地检查和总结团的工作经验。各级党委、政治机关还要善于掌握青年的特点和青年工作的规律，善于用详细耐心的说服的方法来教育和启发青年的积极性、自觉性和创造性。各级党委、政治机关必须用最大的力量来领导部队全体青年解决学习与工作相结合的问题。傅钟副主任强调说明：毛主席对青年团第二次全国代表大会的英明指示就是部队青年工作今后的方向，也是部队青年如何进行学习的根本方法。党领导青年团的重要责任在于教育，团的工作重心在于学习。
    会议最后由主持人作了总结。总结中指出：根据毛主席对青年团第二次全国代表大会的指示来检查我们部队青年工作，主要缺点是不善于根据青年的特点进行工作。部队青年工作干部应该遵循毛主席的指示，使部队青年做到“身体好、学习好、工作好。”青年团应该要求青年认真地学好部队正课；并要循循善诱地教导青年，培养他们优良的道德品质。青年团应根据不同的兵种和不同的工作岗位对青年提出不同的要求，鼓励他们勇敢和上进，培养他们的组织性、纪律性。青年团应该要求青年养成良好的生活习惯，同时也要使他们愉快地进行各种娱乐活动。
    经过讨论，到会干部明确认识了在完成部队中心任务的同时，必须加强青年团的基层组织建设，加强各级青年工作部门的建设。青年工作者必须深入部队，深入团支部，深入青年群众，根据部队任务和部队青年的特点来进行团的工作。
