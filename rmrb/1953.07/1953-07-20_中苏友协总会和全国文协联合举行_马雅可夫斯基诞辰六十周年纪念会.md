    China-Soviet Friendship Association and National Federation of Literary and Art Circles Jointly Hold a Commemorative Meeting for the 60th Anniversary of Mayakovsky's Birth

    The China-Soviet Friendship Association and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly held a commemorative meeting on the evening of the 19th for the 60th anniversary of the birth of the great Soviet poet Mayakovsky.

    Among those attending the commemorative meeting were Cai Tingkai and Shao Lizi, directors of the China-Soviet Friendship Association; well-known Chinese writers, poets, and artists such as Mao Dun, Zheng Zhenduo, Cao Jinghua, Zhou Libo, Sha Ting, Shao Quanlin, Feng Zhi, He Qifang, Yuan Shuipai, Tian Jian, Zhao Feng, Sun Fuyuan, and more than 300 young literary and art workers from Beijing.

    The Soviet Embassy in China's Chargé d'affaires ad interim, Vasikov, and the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries representative, Sokolov, also attended the commemorative meeting. Several diplomatic envoys from various countries to China were also present.

    The commemorative meeting was presided over by Mao Dun, who delivered the opening remarks. He said: Soviet literature has had a great influence on Chinese revolutionary literature. Mayakovsky is a great poet who has influenced Chinese poetry with his works. We have learned from his poems a high degree of patriotism, internationalism, and high artistic skills. Today, as we commemorate him, we must learn his fighting spirit and his infinite loyalty and infinite confidence in the cause of communism.

    Professor Cao Jinghua, famous for translating Soviet literary works, spoke at the meeting, pointing out that Mayakovsky was a very loyal comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people. To express his hatred of imperialist aggression against China, he wrote "Get Out of China!"; to praise the victory of the Chinese working class in the Shanghai Uprising, he wrote "Better Poems." His poems have been inspiring the Chinese people to move forward for more than 20 years.

    The Soviet Embassy in China's Chargé d'affaires ad interim, Vasikov, was also invited to speak at the meeting. He said: Mayakovsky's poems are not only welcomed by the Soviet people but also by progressive mankind all over the world. Because he used brilliant poems to participate in the struggle to create a new world and praised the friendship of working people all over the world. He was particularly concerned about the Chinese people's struggle for liberation. The unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is the best monument to commemorate Mayakovsky.

    Poet Yuan Shuipai said at the meeting: Mayakovsky is the founder of Soviet socialist realism poetry, and his poetry has ushered in a new era in world poetry. Yuan Shuipai also pointed out that Mayakovsky's greatest characteristic is his inseparable relationship with the Party and the working class, as well as his close connection with the masses and his tireless, serious, and conscientious spirit of serving the people. Yuan Shuipai said: Chinese poets, while learning from the excellent poetic traditions of our nation and learning from the progressive poetry of the Soviet Union and other countries of the same era, should especially learn from Mayakovsky.

    At the commemorative meeting, Chinese literary and art workers recited Chinese translations of Mayakovsky's famous works "Better Poems," "Meeting Mania," "Soviet Passport," and "Lenin," and Soviet friends recited the Russian original of the poem "Soviet Passport." These recitations were warmly welcomed. (Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联驻我国大使馆临时代办华司考，苏联对外文化协会代表索高洛夫等也出席了纪念会。出席纪念会的还有各国驻我国外交官员多人。
    纪念会由茅盾主持并致开会词。他说：苏联文学对我国革命文学起了很大的影响。马雅可夫斯基就是以自己的作品对我国诗歌起了影响的一位伟大诗人。我们从他的诗里学习了高度的爱国主义国际主义精神和高度的艺术技巧。今天我们纪念他，更要学习他的战斗精神，学习他对共产主义事业的无限忠诚与无限信心。
    以翻译苏联文学作品著名的曹靖华教授在会上发言，他指出马雅可夫斯基是中国人民很忠诚的战友。为了愤恨帝国主义的侵略中国，他写了“滚出中国！”；为了歌颂中国工人阶级在上海起义的胜利，他写了“更好的诗”。他的诗二十多年来一直在鼓舞中国人民前进。
    苏联驻我国大使馆临时代办华司考也应邀在会上讲话。他说：马雅可夫斯基的诗歌，不仅受到苏联人民的欢迎，也受到全世界进步人类的欢迎。因为他用光辉的诗篇参加了新世界创造的斗争，歌颂了全世界劳动人民的友谊。他对中国人民的解放斗争是特别关心的。中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊，就是纪念马雅可夫斯基的最好的纪念碑。
    诗人袁水拍在会上说：马雅可夫斯基是苏联社会主义现实主义诗歌的奠基人，他的诗歌使世界的诗歌出现了一个新的时代。袁水拍还指出马雅可夫斯基的最大的特点，是他的和党和工人阶级的不可分离的关系，以及他的密切联系群众和不疲倦地严肃认真的为人民服务的精神。袁水拍说：中国诗人，在学习我国民族的优秀诗歌传统，学习同时代的苏联和各国进步诗歌的同时，特别应该学习马雅可夫斯基。
