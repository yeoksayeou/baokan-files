Xinhua News Agency, July 5th. According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 3rd: In June, the Vietnamese People's Army crushed two "mopping-up" operations by the French colonial troops in the Plain of Reeds and Bac Lieu Province in South Vietnam, achieving the result of annihilating seven French companies and more than four hundred soldiers.

    In late June, a large number of French troops, supported by six gunboats and sixteen amphibious tanks, conducted a "mopping-up" operation in the Plain of Reeds west of Saigon. After two days of resistance, the People's Army launched a swift counter-offensive on June 25th and, taking advantage of the victory, pursued the fleeing French troops in disarray. The battered remnants of the French troops hastily withdrew from the Plain of Reeds the next day. According to incomplete statistics, the People's Army completely annihilated seven French companies in this victorious counter-"mopping-up" operation, capturing forty-two people, including a French captain commander. The People's Army captured one mortar, ten machine guns, and fifty submachine guns and rifles.
    Prior to this, the People's Army had also crushed another "mopping-up" operation by the French troops in Bac Lieu Province, southwest of Saigon, in June, annihilating more than four hundred French soldiers. They sank five French ships, damaged one, and damaged one French aircraft.

    越南人民军在南越粉碎法军两次“扫荡”
    歼灭法军七个连又四百多人
    【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社三日讯：越南人民军六月份在南越的水草平原和薄寮省粉碎了法国殖民军队的两次“扫荡”战，取得了歼灭法军七个连又四百多人的战果。
    六月下旬，大量法军在六艘炮艇和十六辆水陆两用战车的支援下，向西贡以西的水草平原进行“扫荡”。人民军在进行了两天的阻击之后，在六月二十五日迅速发起反攻，并乘胜追击狼狈逃窜的法军。被打得七零八落的法军残部在第二天就慌忙退出水草平原。据不完全统计，人民军在这次胜利的反“扫荡”战中完全歼灭法军七个连，俘掳四十二人，其中有法军的上尉指挥官一名。人民军缴获迫击炮一门、机枪十挺、冲锋枪和步枪五十支。
    在此以前，人民军在六月份并曾在西贡西南的薄寮省粉碎法军的另一次“扫荡”，歼灭法军四百多人。打沉法军船只五艘、打伤一艘，打伤法机一架。
