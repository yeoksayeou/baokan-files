Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: The election of basic-level political power in New China, which is of historical significance in the political life of our people, has officially begun in many regions across the country. From mid-June to early July, many provinces and cities in the Southwest Region, including Sichuan, Xikang, and Guizhou; in the East China Region, Fujian; in the Central South Region, Jiangxi and Guangzhou; and in the Northeast Region, Liaodong, Jilin, and Fushun, have successively started the first batch of basic-level elections. Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Nanjing, and other provinces and cities are actively preparing for the first batch of basic-level elections, and Jiangsu Province will soon begin basic-level elections in batches.

In the regions where the first batch of basic-level elections has already begun, tens of thousands of trained universal suffrage work cadres have arrived at their work locations. They are all in high spirits and full of confidence, ready to complete this glorious task. In the Fuling Special District of Sichuan Province, there are more than 3,100 universal suffrage work cadres. Before the universal suffrage work began, they arrived in various townships and started the universal suffrage process by leading farmers in production. In Xikang Province, hundreds of universal suffrage work groups composed of more than 3,000 cadres have widely launched propaganda work in vast rural areas. The cadres dispatched to the suburbs of Guangzhou for universal suffrage work are working in the fields with farmers to carry out field propaganda.

The first batch of basic-level elections in various provinces and cities includes different areas: plains and hills, remote mountainous areas, market towns, cities and ports, areas with mixed ethnic groups, old revolutionary base areas during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, and hometowns of overseas Chinese. Before starting, these areas generally established election committees, formulated detailed plans, transferred and trained a large number of cadres, and conducted typical pilot projects. More than 10 million copies of study and propaganda materials and registration forms in Shaanxi Province are being distributed to various places. Basic-level election funds of 7.5 billion yuan allocated from the state treasury have also been distributed to various places. Before the start of the universal suffrage movement, Liaodong Province launched a province-wide universal suffrage publicity campaign. Hundreds and thousands of reporters, propagandists, street singing teams, and slideshow teams launched extensive activities in cities and villages. Sichuan Province, after full preparation, has a total of 2,000 townships with the conditions to generally start basic-level elections, covering an area with a population of more than 10 million. Guizhou Province selected 1,987 townships, 16 urban districts, and two cities with sufficient preparation and convenient transportation conditions to carry out the first batch of basic-level election work.

In areas where basic-level elections have officially begun, election committees at all levels have adopted a wave-like, gradual approach to steadily carry out the universal suffrage work. The Fushun Municipal Election Committee criticized the hasty sentiment of "advancing at the same pace and competing with each other" that existed among some cadres after the basic-level elections began. In order to effectively and comprehensively carry out the universal suffrage work, the Nanjing Municipal Election Committee also specially sent cadres to Jinan to absorb experience. Many provinces and cities have sent capable work teams to various places to guide the progress of basic-level election work and conduct timely inspections. The Southwest Administrative Committee and the Sichuan Provincial People's Government dispatched 60 cadres to the old revolutionary base areas of five counties in the Dazhou Special District of Sichuan Province to help with basic-level election work. Chen Zenggu, Vice Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Election Committee, will soon lead a group of cadres to the countryside to guide the integration of universal suffrage work and production in various places.

An important condition for ensuring the successful completion of the first batch of basic-level election work is that all regions have conscientiously carried out typical pilot projects for universal suffrage. Not only has a lot of important work experience been gained from the pilot projects, but also many vivid facts have proved that the conditions for implementing universal suffrage in our country are mature. The broad masses of the people have a high degree of political awareness. In order to consolidate the basic-level people's political power, they actively participated in the universal suffrage movement. Now, these areas that have started the first batch of basic-level elections will widely use these experiences, rely more fully on the masses, and give play to the political enthusiasm of the masses to complete this great historical task.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 19th: In the typical pilot areas for basic-level elections in Sichuan Province, the broad masses of women actively participated in the universal suffrage movement with high political enthusiasm. Many highly conscious working women who have close ties with the masses have been elected as people's representatives and participated in the work of the people's political power. According to statistics from 23 townships and 4 towns in 6 special districts, including Wenjiang, Suining, Guangyuan, Luzhou, Neijiang, and Jiangjin, the average number of female voters participating in the election accounted for 86.6 percent of all female voters. Among them, the number of female voters participating in the election in Qingliu Township in Xinfan County and Luohan Town in Luzhou City reached more than 96 percent.

After publicity and education, the broad masses of women understood the great significance of universal suffrage, and they took the initiative to assist the election committees in carrying out universal suffrage work. Women in the jurisdiction of the Citang Street Public Security Police Station in Chengdu City voluntarily organized themselves to calculate their ages in advance during population surveys and voter registration, and went to the registration stations in batches, which enabled the completion of population surveys and other work in the jurisdiction three days ahead of schedule. Zhang Huaifu, a female propagandist in Niqiao Village, Naxi County, promoted the universal suffrage to the masses from house to house regardless of wind and rain. Because of her efforts, there were no blank spots in the universal suffrage publicity work in the village. In the pilot areas for universal suffrage in Jiangjin, Pingchang, Chengdu, and other counties and cities, many women also actively exposed landlord class elements who illegally stole the right to vote.

Women who have the right to vote love their democratic rights and actively participate in elections after receiving their voter certificates.

On the day of the election, female voters in the fifth village of Jinquan Township, Pixian County, wore their voter certificates on their chests one by one and entered the venue in formation, feeling very excited. The election day is also a day to review the strength of women. The vast majority of young, middle-aged, and even elderly female voters went to the meeting and voted with a high degree of political enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility. In a happy mood, wearing festive costumes, some with flowers in their hair, they walked into the venue singing and laughing. In many places, female voters arranged their housework the night before. At the election meeting in Qingliu Township, Xinfan County, eight female voters over the age of 70 were supported by their sons and daughters-in-law to attend the meeting and vote.

Among the newly elected people's representatives in the pilot areas, many are highly conscious working women who are supported by the masses. According to statistics from 19 townships and 4 towns in the two special districts of Wenjiang and Luzhou, 175 of the 818 elected people's representatives are excellent female people's representatives, accounting for 20.6 percent of all representatives. Many female representatives have also been elected as members of the township people's government. According to statistics from five townships including Ande Township in Chongning County, eight of the 59 township government members are women. Some female people's representatives have also been elected as township chiefs or deputy township chiefs. These female people's representatives and government members are all rural activists who have been trained in various movements in the countryside. For example, Wang Mingzhen of the fourth village of Baizhang Township, Qionglai County, can usually earnestly solve problems for women and has always been active in any work. She works while sick in leading the production of mutual aid groups and never complains. Therefore, she has won the support of the people in the village and was elected as a people's representative.

    全国许多地区开始基层选举
    四川基层选举典型试办地区妇女积极参加普选运动
    【新华社十九日讯】在我国人民政治生活中具有历史意义的新中国基层政权的选举，已在全国许多地区正式展开。从六月中旬到七月上旬，西南区的四川、西康、贵州，华东区的福建，中南区的江西、广州，东北区的辽东、吉林、抚顺等许多省、市都相继开始了第一批基层选举。陕西、江苏、南京等省、市正在积极进行第一批基层选举的准备工作，江苏省不久即将分批开始基层选举。
    已经开始第一批基层选举的地区，成千成万个经过训练的普选工作干部已到达工作地点。他们都精神饱满、信心充沛地准备完成这一光荣任务。四川省涪陵专区有三千一百多名普选工作干部。在普选工作开始以前便到达各乡，从领导农民生产入手进行普选。西康省由三千多名干部组成的成百个普选工作组，已在辽阔的乡村中广泛地展开了宣传工作。广州市派到郊区进行普选工作的干部，正和农民一道下田，展开田间宣传。
    各省市开始第一批基层选举，包括各种不同的地区：有平原和丘陵地带，有地处偏僻的山区，有集镇、城市和码头，有民族杂居区，有第二次国内革命战争时期的革命老根据地，还有华侨的故乡。这些地区在开始以前都普遍成立了选举委员会，制定了周密的计划，抽调和训练了大批干部，并进行了典型试办工作。陕西省一千多万份学习、宣传材料和登记表册正向各地分发。从国库开支的七十五亿元基层选举经费也已拨发各地。辽东省在普选运动开始以前就在全省范围内展开了普选宣传活动，成百成千的报告员、宣传员、街头演唱队和幻灯队在城市和乡村中展开了广泛的活动。四川省经过充分准备，已具备普遍开始基层选举的条件的共有二千个乡；包括一千多万人口的地区。贵州省选择了准备工作充分、交通条件方便的一千九百八十七个乡、十六个城关区和两个市展开了第一批基层选举工作。
    正式开始基层选举的地区，各级选举委员会采取了波浪式的逐步展开的办法，稳步地展开普选工作。抚顺市选举委员会在基层选举展开以后，批判了某些干部中存在的“齐头并进相互竞赛”的急躁情绪。为了有效地全面展开普选工作，南京市选举委员会还专门派干部到济南去吸收经验。许多省、市已经派出了精干的工作组前往各地，一面指导基层选举工作的进行，一面及时地进行检查。西南行政委员会和四川省人民政府派出六十名干部到四川省达县专区五个县的革命老根据地帮助基层选举工作。贵州省人民政府副主席、省选举委员会副主席陈曾固即将率领一批干部下乡，指导各地普选工作与生产结合进行。
    能够保证第一批基层选举工作胜利完成的重要条件，是各地都认真地进行了普选的典型试办工作。从试办中不仅取得了许多重要的工作经验，而且通过许多生动的事实证明了在我国实行普选的条件已经成熟。广大的人民群众都有了很高的政治觉悟，为了巩固基层人民政权，他们积极地参加了普选运动。现在这些开始第一批基层选举的地区，将广泛地运用这些经验，更充分地依靠群众，发挥群众的政治积极性，来完成这一伟大的历史任务。
    【新华社成都十九日电】在四川省基层选举典型试办的地区中，广大妇女以高度的政治热情积极参加普选运动。许多觉悟很高和群众有密切联系的劳动妇女已被选为人民代表，参与了人民政权工作。据温江、遂宁、广元、泸州、内江、江津等六个专区的二十三个乡和四个镇的统计，参加选举的女选民，平均占全部女选民的百分之八十六点六。其中新繁县清流乡和泸州市罗汉镇参加选举的女选民达到百分之九十六以上。
    广大妇女经过宣传教育以后，懂得了普选的伟大意义，她们主动地协助选举委员会开展普选工作。成都市祠堂街公安派出所辖区的妇女在人口调查和选民登记中，自动组织起来事先算好年龄，并分批前往登记站登记，使该辖区的人口调查等工作提前三天完成。纳溪县坭桥村女宣传员张怀府，不避风雨地逐户向群众宣传，因为她的努力，该村普选宣传工作没有一个空白点。江津、平昌、成都等县、市普选试办地区，许多妇女还积极揭发了非法窃取选举权利的地主阶级分子。
    有公民权的妇女们在领到选民证以后，都热爱自己的民主权利，踊跃地参加选举。
    郫县金泉乡第五村的女选民在选举那一天，一个个把选民证佩在胸前，整队进入会场，心里都非常兴奋。选举的日子，也是检阅妇女力量的一天。各地绝大部分青、壮年以至老年的女选民，都以高度的政治积极性和责任感踊跃地到会投了票。他们以愉快的心情，穿着节日的服装，有的头上戴着花朵，又唱又笑地走进会场。许多地方的女选民在头一天夜里就把家务琐事安排好。在新繁县清流乡的选举会上，有八个七十岁以上的女选民由儿子、媳妇们搀扶着到会投了票。
    在各试办地区新选出的人民代表中，有许多是觉悟很高为群众拥护的劳动妇女。据温江、泸州两个专区的十九个乡和四个镇的统计，选出的八百一十八个人民代表中，有一百七十五个是优秀的女人民代表，占全部代表的百分之二十点六。许多女代表并被选为乡人民政府的委员。据崇宁县安德乡等五个乡的统计，在全部五十九个乡政府委员中，有八个委员是妇女。有的女人民代表并被选为乡长或副乡长。这些女人民代表和政府委员，都是农村中各种运动中经过锻炼的农村积极分子。如邛崃县百丈乡第四村的王明珍，平常能够认真地为妇女们解决问题，在任何工作中一贯积极。她在领导互助组的生产中，带病工作，从不叫苦，因此她获得全村人民的拥护，被选为人民代表。
