    Central Institute of Physical Education to be Established in Beijing This Autumn

    The Central Institute of Physical Education, after a year of preparatory work, will be formally established and begin enrolling students this autumn.

    The Central Institute of Physical Education is a higher education institution specializing in training full-time sports cadres. It has three sections: undergraduate, competitive coaching, and research. The undergraduate program trains sports administrative cadres and physical education teachers for secondary schools. Originally planned as a four-year course, it has been temporarily shortened to two years to meet the urgent needs of current sports work. The competitive coaching section trains high-level athletes and advanced technical instructors, with a study period of two years. The research section trains teachers for specialized sports training institutions and physical education teachers for universities, with a study period of one year.

    According to the teaching plan, students will systematically study political courses, education courses (such as pedagogy, psychology, teaching methods, etc.), sports theory courses (such as sports theory, sports administration, human anatomy, physiology, hygiene, etc.), sports technology courses (such as track and field, gymnastics, ball games, water sports, ice sports, dance, etc.) and Russian. Soviet experts will come to the institute to guide these teaching activities.

    The Central Institute of Physical Education is located near the old site of the Yuanmingyuan in the western suburbs of Beijing. The institute plans to enroll 560 undergraduate students this year. Within five years, it will grow to 3,000 students.
