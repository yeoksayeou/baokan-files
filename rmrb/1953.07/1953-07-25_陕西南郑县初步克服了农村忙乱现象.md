Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, Initially Overcomes Rural Chaos

Before April, the working situation of the leading organs in Nanzheng County was quite chaotic. Departments and sections did not communicate with each other, and no one understood the actual situation in the countryside. They sat in their offices issuing instructions and demanding forms. Under the "five excesses" situation (excessive meetings, documents, organizations, concurrent jobs, and activities), district and township cadres adopted an attitude of "fleas are many, no itch; debts are many, no worry." They dragged their feet on tasks assigned by higher authorities and lacked enthusiasm for work.

On April 10th, the Nanzheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the nine district party secretaries, district heads, and heads of county-level departments to review the work based on the Central Committee's instructions on spring plowing and production. Peng Xingren, Secretary of the Xinmin District Committee, said: "The county asks for too many forms and instructions. In March, the County Government's Culture and Education Section, Construction Section, and Finance Section issued fifty-two kinds of forms. In addition, we can't keep up with the daily phone calls. One day, the Public Security Bureau said on the phone: 'You have two days to register all enemy and puppet personnel once.' The Marriage Law Office called and said: 'The campaign to implement the Marriage Law will be extended for another five days.' We had just notified the township when we received a phone call saying it wasn't extended. Finance Section, Communist Youth League… the calls are constant. We can't leave our posts, and the work in the key production township (Huilong Township) is no different from that in ordinary townships. When we want to check on production work, we can only ask about it incidentally while doing other work. We don't have time to digest what the higher authorities send, so we just push it down to the townships as is. Many district and township cadres say: 'Fleas are many, no itch; debts are many, no worry. Orders change in the morning and evening, it's all the same anyway.' Of the forty-six forms issued in March, twelve have not been filled out yet." At the end of February, County Head Liu Qi, at the county's three-level cadre meeting, focused on implementing the Marriage Law and spring plowing production "as the main task," and arranged twelve "combined" tasks, including hygiene, culture and education, and banning Yiguandao, but rarely taught methods for "combining." Nanhai and Hongmiao districts are eighty to one hundred li away from the county seat, and it takes half a month to go to the county for meetings twice a month. Leadership remains only at meetings. All districts in the county generally stipulate: Hold a branch point meeting every three days, and a district and township cadre meeting every half month. Each meeting requires a written work summary report. Each task requires at least four meetings to be conveyed to the masses. "Rooster crow meetings" and "midnight meetings" are extremely common. Township cadres and farmers say: "The candy seller says the candy is sweet, the vinegar seller says the vinegar is sour, which work is important?" Many things are said to be "slow," but cannot be "stopped," and as a result, they still overwhelm production. County-level leaders are also unable to go deep into the countryside, trapped in a circle of affairs from which they cannot escape, and are very distressed.

The problems were raised at that meeting, but they were not resolved.

How can production be put in an overwhelming position? How can summer harvesting and planting be done well? In mid-May, the Nanzheng County three-level cadre meeting focused on discussing this issue. They adopted these methods to initially overcome the rural chaos:

(1) Improve work methods. County and district cadres are responsible for different areas, go deep into key villages and groups, set examples, provide guidance at any time, and promote the activities of general villages and groups.
(2) Rationally arrange work, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, and turn all forces to agricultural production. The February three-level cadre meeting arranged fourteen tasks; in mid-May, after discussion and research by county, district, and township cadres, it was proposed that the focus before May and June should be on doing a good job in summer harvesting and rice transplanting, consolidating and improving existing mutual aid teams through production, calling for the organization of temporary mutual aid teams, and stopping all work unrelated to production. As a result, the county's summer harvesting and rice transplanting work was completed twelve days earlier than last year, and the work was done more meticulously than in previous years.
(3) Stabilize the morale of cadres, and initially examine and criticize the erroneous ideas of rural work cadres who despise agriculture and request job transfers.
(4) Centralize leadership, issue fewer instructions, and hold fewer meetings. According to statistics from the County People's Government in March, a total of six instructions and fifty-seven notices and forms were issued. In May, only thirteen notices were issued in the county. How was this reduced? The main reason was the centralization of leadership, stipulating that all instructions issued by various departments must be approved by the负责人负责人 of the county party committee and the county government; forms and notices must not reach districts and townships directly. Townships have also controlled meetings. In Liangshan District, district and township cadres stipulated that mass meetings in the township must be prepared in advance and held with the approval of the district. During the one-and-a-half-month summer harvest and transplanting work, the county party committee held only one joint meeting of department heads and one joint meeting of district party secretaries and district heads, summarizing the summer harvest and transplanting work and arranging for tasks such as protecting seedlings, preventing floods, preventing droughts, preventing insects, and consolidating and improving mutual aid teams. District and township cadres reflected: "This season's work feels as refreshing as wearing clean clothes, and the mind is clear." (Feng Zhonghua)

    陕西南郑县初步克服了农村忙乱现象
    四月份以前，陕西南郑县领导机关的工作情况是相当混乱的。各科、部、室互不联系，大家都不了解农村实际情况，蹲在机关里发指示，要表格。在“五多”的情况下，区乡干部就抱着“虱多不咬，账多不愁”的态度，对上级分配的任务，拖一天是一天，工作很不起劲。
    四月十日，中共南郑县委召集了全县九个区的区委书记、区长和县级机关各科、部长参加的会议，根据中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示检查了工作。新民区区委书记彭兴仁说：“县上要的表格指示太多了。三月份，县府文教科、建设科、财政科发下五十二种表格。另外，每天的电话就接不过来。有一天，公安局在电话上说：‘限你两天把敌伪人员一律登记一次。’婚姻法办公室来电话说：‘贯彻婚姻法运动再延长五天。’我们刚通知了乡里，又接到电话说不延长了。财政科，青年团，……电话不断。我们离不开身子，生产重点乡（回龙乡）的工作做得和一般乡无大差别。我们要检查生产工作，就只能在做别的工作时附带问一问。上级发来的东西，我们没工夫消化，只能原物一伙推下乡去。许多区乡干部都说：‘虱多不咬，账多不愁。朝令夕改，反正就是那么回事。’三月发下的四十六种表格，到现在还有十二种没有填起。”二月底，县长刘齐在全县三级干部会上以贯彻婚姻法、春耕生产“为主”，布置了卫生、文教、取缔一贯道等十二件“结合”的工作，但很少教给“结合”的办法。南海、红庙两个区距离县八十里到百里，每月到县上开两次会议，就要花去半月时间。领导只停留在会议上。全县各区大都规定：三天开一次支点会，半月开一次区乡干部会，每次会上要写书面的工作总结报告。每项工作至少要开四次会议才能传达给群众。“鸡叫会”“半夜会”极为普遍。乡村干部和农民说：“卖糖的说糖甜，卖醋的说醋酸，到底什么工作重要？”许多事情说是可“缓”，但是不可“停”，结果仍然压倒了生产。县级领导干部同样不能深入农村，缠绕在事务圈子里摆脱不了，十分苦闷。
    那次会议上把问题摆出来了，但是仍然没有解决。
    究竟怎样才能把生产放到压倒一切的地位呢？怎样才能做好夏收夏种工作呢？五月中旬南郑县三级干部会议着重讨论了这个问题。他们采用这些方法初步克服了农村忙乱现象：
    （一）改进工作方法，县区干部分片负责，深入重点村、组，做出样子，随时指导，推动一般村组的活动。
        （二）合理安排工作，分别轻重缓急，把所有力量转向农业生产。二月三级干部会议上曾布置了十四件工作；五月中旬，经过县区乡干部讨论研究，提出五六月以前以做好夏收插秧工作为中心，通过生产巩固提高现有互助组，号召组织临时互助组，把和生产无关的工作都停止了。因此，全县的夏收插秧工作比去年提前十二天完成了，活路做得也比往年细致。
        （三）安定干部情绪，初步检查批判了农村工作干部轻视农业、要求调动工作等错误思想。
        （四）集中领导，少发指示少开会。据县人民政府三月份统计，共发指示六件，通知、表格五十七件。五月份全县只发过十三件通知。怎样减少的呢？主要是集中了领导，规定各部门发指示都要经县委、县府负责人批准；表格、通知不得直达区乡。各乡对会议也做了控制。梁山区由区乡干部规定：开乡的群众大会，要事前做好准备，经区上批准才能举行。县委在一个半月的夏收插秧工作中，只开了一次科部长联席会议，一次区委书记、区长联席会议，总结了夏收插秧工作，布置了保苗、防洪、防旱、防虫、巩固提高互助组等工作。区乡干部反映：“这一季的工作，好像穿上了干净衣裳一样爽快，脑子也清楚了。”（冯忠骅）
