Xinhua News Agency, Washington: The US government's efforts to dump "surplus" agricultural products abroad, while simultaneously tightening restrictions on imports of foreign goods, have provoked strong protests from the United States' closest followers.

    According to an order issued by Eisenhower on June 9, the United States will, from July 1, further increase import tariffs on dairy products and reduce import quotas under the so-called "Agricultural Adjustment Act." According to the Associated Press, foreign cheese imports will be reduced by half after the new law is implemented, the US domestic market for foreign whole milk powder will shrink to one-twentieth of its 1952 level, and imports of foreign skim milk powder will in effect be completely eliminated.

    The US government's measure has aroused dissatisfaction among countries in the capitalist world that produce large quantities of dairy products. These countries include the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and other Commonwealth countries. Following the New Zealand government, which recently formally protested to the US government, the Australian and Canadian governments have also lodged strong protests with the US government. According to United Press International, the Australian government submitted a "strongly worded" note on June 29, protesting against the US restriction on dairy product imports and expressing "concern" over the US intention to dump "surplus products" abroad at low prices. On June 30, the Canadian government also submitted a "strongly worded" protest note to the US government, accusing the US government of taking measures related to Canadian interests without consultation. The note stated: "The result of unilaterally taking such action will inevitably cause serious problems, not only in international trade but also in the entire international cooperation system." The Canadian government's note resentfully recalled that Canada had submitted several notes regarding the US's "severe" import restriction measures. However, the United States has intensified its actions. The note expressed a common concern of other capitalist countries, saying: "Agricultural policy has become a very sensitive issue in many countries... The Canadian government is concerned not only about the prevalence of agricultural protectionism but also about the threat of dumping agricultural products in the world trade market that may follow."

    According to Xinhua News Agency: The New Zealand Embassy in the United States notified the United States in a note on June 23 that the large-scale dumping of surplus agricultural products abroad by the United States would cause "serious disruptions" in the markets of countries that rely on milk product exports. The message said that a bill has been introduced in Congress authorizing the "Mutual Security Agency" to sell more than $2 billion worth of surplus agricultural products abroad, including butter, cheese, and milk products.

    The note expressed "very serious concern" about this matter and stated that New Zealand's export trade, which "greatly relies" on milk product exports, would be "seriously damaged" due to the US promotion of surplus milk products.

### 新西兰、澳大利亚和加拿大政府  抗议美国向国外倾销农产品

   抗议美国向国外倾销农产品
    【新华社讯】华盛顿消息：美国政府竭力向国外倾销“过剩”的农产品，同时又加紧限制外国货物入口，这种作法已经引起了美国一向最密切的追随者的猛烈抗议。
    根据艾森豪威尔六月九日颁布的命令，美国自七月一日起根据所谓“农业调整法”，将再提高乳制品入口关税并降低入口限额。据美联社估计，在新法令实行后，外国乾酪的入口将会减少一半，美国国内容纳外国全脂奶粉的市场缩小至一九五二年的二十分之一，而外国去脂奶粉的入口实际上将完全取消。
    美国政府这一措施宣布后，资本主义世界生产大量奶制品的国家纷纷表示不满。在这些国家中有荷兰、丹麦和英国及其他英联邦国家。继新近向美国政府正式提出抗议的新西兰政府之后，澳大利亚政府和加拿大政府也先后向美国政府提出强烈抗议。据合众社消息，澳大利亚政府六月二十九日提出“语气强硬”的照会，抗议美国限制乳制品入口，并对美国打算以低价向国外倾销“剩余产品”表示“忧虑”。加拿大政府在六月三十日也对美国政府提出“措辞强硬”的抗议照会，责备美国政府未经协商迳自采取关系加拿大利益的措施。照会说：“单方面采取这种行动的结果，不但在国际贸易方面，而且在整个国际合作制度方面，必将引起严重的问题。”加拿大政府的照会怨愤地回溯说，关于美国限制入口的“严厉”措施，加拿大已提出过几次照会。但是美国反而变本加厉。照会表示了一种其他资本主义国家的共同忧虑说：“农业政策在许多国家已变成了一个十分敏感的问题，……加拿大政府所忧虑的不但是农业保护主义的盛行，而且也忧虑可能随之而来的在世界贸易市场中倾销农产品的威胁。”
    据新华社讯：新西兰驻美大使馆六月二十三日曾以照会通知美国说，美国向国外大量倾销过剩的农产品将会在依靠牛乳产品出口的国家的市场上引起“严重纷扰”。消息说，国会中已提出一项法案，授权“共同安全署”在国外销售价值在二十亿美元以上的过剩农产品，包括牛油、乾酪和牛乳商品。
    照会对这件事情表示“非常忧虑”，并说经济上“大大地依靠”牛乳产品出口的新西兰的出口贸易，因为美国推销剩余牛乳产品会受到“重大损害”。
