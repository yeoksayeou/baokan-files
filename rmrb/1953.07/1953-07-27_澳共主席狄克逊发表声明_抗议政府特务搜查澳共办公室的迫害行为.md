Xinhua News Agency, Sydney Dispatch from TASS: Australian newspapers on the 18th published a statement by the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party, Dixon, regarding the search of the Australian Communist Party's offices in Sydney on the 17th by agents of the Australian Federal Security Bureau. The statement said:

“The Australian Communist Party will protest to the government regarding this event, which violates the basic rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association. The secret police said they were searching for information related to the article 'Democratic Monarchy' published in the June issue of 'Communist Review'. However, the documents confiscated by the secret police were completely unrelated to this matter. This shows that the Menzies government is afraid of the Communist Party's recent exposures of the security police, especially the exposure in the July 8th 'Tribune' of their use of public funds to attempt to buy off Communist Party members. Moreover, they are very concerned about the Communist Party's exposure of the serious malpractices of government-controlled secret ballots. The Communist Party has detailed this situation, but the government and security police have not responded. We believe that the government's intention is to conspire to frame Communist Party leaders. The Central Committee is calling on the entire party to be vigilant and calling on labor organizations to protest."

    抗议政府特务搜查澳共办公室的迫害行为
    【新华社讯】塔斯社悉尼讯：十八日，澳大利亚各报刊载了澳大利亚共产党中央委员会主席狄克逊就澳大利亚联邦保安局特务十七日在悉尼搜查澳大利亚共产党的办公室一事发表的声明。声明说：
    “对于这一侵犯言论自由和结社自由的基本权利的事件，澳大利亚共产党即将向政府提出抗议。秘密警察说是要搜查有关‘共产主义评论’六月号所载‘民主的君主政体’一文的情报，但是，秘密警察所没收的文件都是和这件事情完全无关的。这件事显出孟席斯政府害怕共产党最近对保安警察的揭发，特别是害怕七月八日‘论坛报’所发表的他们使用公款企图收买共产党党员这一事实的揭发。而且，他们十分忧虑共产党揭发政府控制下的秘密投票的严重舞弊情形。对于这一情形，共产党已经详细地加以揭发，而政府和保安警察却没有答复。我们认为政府的意图是阴谋陷害共产党领袖。中央委员会正在号召全党警惕，并号召劳工组织提出抗议。”
