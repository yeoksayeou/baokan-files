Soviet Poet Vladimir Mayakovsky
Soviet Union, V. Nikolaev

The Soviet socialist era gave the world Vladimir Mayakovsky—a great revolutionary language artist. A passionate Soviet patriot, the inspiring singer of the Communist Party, Mayakovsky dedicated all his "poet's loud power" to the struggle for the victory of communism.

V. Mayakovsky embodied the excellent qualities of a new type of literary figure. He was a poet, an agitator, an outstanding Soviet satirist, a social activist, and an ardent propagandist and inspirer of the great ideas of the Communist Party. In his best works—songs of the new life—he poetically summarized the characteristics of a magnificent era of destroying the old and building the new, the socialist system.

In 1893, V. Mayakovsky was born in the village of Baghdati in the Kutais Governorate, in the family of a forestry district chief. In 1908, as a fifteen-year-old boy, he approached the Bolsheviks. He did propaganda work and was arrested three times for it. After arriving in Moscow, Mayakovsky studied painting, sculpture, and architecture at school, but was expelled for his futurist "left-leaning" tendencies.

Mayakovsky's creative path was not easy. He made some mistakes and took detours, especially before he participated in revolutionary activities. But even during this period, Mayakovsky's works already expressed anger at the bourgeois and landlord classes and a tireless spirit of searching for new paths in art.

The poet himself explained the significance of his pre-revolutionary work "A Cloud in Trousers" as a revolt against bourgeois morality, against base bourgeois art, and against all systems of enslavement and violence. In another excellent pre-revolutionary work, "War and Peace," the poet severely opposed the world imperialist slaughter, explaining that war was meaningless for the working people.

It is worth noting that Mayakovsky, even before the revolution, shared the views of the "Petrel of the Revolution," the great proletarian writer Gorky. Gorky considered the young Mayakovsky to be a most talented poet and gave his full creative work active support and profound influence.

Mayakovsky enthusiastically participated in the Great October Socialist Revolution. "My revolution"—he declared. The poet considered himself mobilized and called upon by the revolution. During these years, he created a large number of inspiring poems, notably "Left March," "Ode to the Revolution," "The Story of a Foolish Old Woman Talking About Wrangel," "Order to the Army of the Arts," and other works. He worked in the theater, creating the first revolutionary drama "Mystery-Bouffe," wrote a screenplay "At the Front," and participated in photography work.

Not only a poet, but also an artist, Mayakovsky fought for the revolutionary cause with the language and pen of a poet. During the Civil War, Mayakovsky worked at the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA), where he created a series of agitational propaganda posters—"ROSTA Windows." Mayakovsky created nearly five hundred propaganda posters, which became examples of modern Soviet agitational propaganda.

It should be said that Mayakovsky was a singer of the revolution. The revolution not only became the biggest theme of his entire work, but also the most important realm of his poetic creation.

Mayakovsky, along with Gorky, Demyan Bedny, and Serafimovich, stood at the forefront of Soviet literature, the literature of socialist realism. In his poems, the creative method of socialist realism is unusually fully expressed. This method requires artists to correctly and historically concretely depict reality in revolutionary development.

The actual situation in the Soviet Union, in its rapid revolutionary development, proved every moment how the people's ideals of a free, creative, and joyful life were becoming reality. This was also the embodiment of the poet's own best hopes and ideals. Precisely because of this, the surrounding life was, for Mayakovsky, a powerful source of inspiration.

The tone of peaceful socialist labor runs through Mayakovsky's entire work. He wrote a poem about the workers of Kursk who mined the first batch of ore, and he rejoiced at this first major victory in peaceful constructive labor. These poems include "The Story of Foundryman Ivan Kozyrev Moving into a New Home," "The Story of the Kuznetsk Construction Project and the People of Kuznetsk," and others.

In his works, such as "Prose about Meetings," "Bureaucratia," "The Philistine," and the satirical plays "The Bedbug" and "The Bathhouse," he used the merciless flame of satire to burn away everything bad, decaying, rigid, and obstructive in life.

After reading the satirical poem "Prose about Meetings" (which severely criticized the frequent meetings in many institutions), Lenin gave it a good evaluation. This criticism was of great significance to the further flourishing of Mayakovsky's work. The leader's words made the poet believe that the path he had chosen was correct, and that the artist's contact with life was the most effective form of serving the people.

The two poems that Mayakovsky created in the mid-1920s: "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin" (1924) and "Okay!" (1927) are the pinnacles of his work. Mayakovsky was the first in Soviet poetry to create a magnificent poetic memorial to the leader of advanced humanity and the organizer of the world's first socialist state. The poem "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin"—which can be said to be an epic of vast scale, and at the same time a lyrical work—creates the image of Lenin against the background of historical events of world significance. In this poem, Lenin's life and activities are expressed in an inseparable and organic connection with the workers' movement and the glorious Communist Party. Mayakovsky skillfully combined greatness and simplicity in the image of Vladimir Ilyich, so this image gives people a special sense of intimacy, simplicity, warmth, and humanity.

Mayakovsky's commemorative poem "Okay!", written for the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, is, like "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin," the pinnacle of Soviet poetic creation. In this poem, Mayakovsky not only talked about the history of the Great October Revolution, but also reflected the history of the successful construction of socialism in the Soviet Union. His entire work is filled with excited political passion. Whether in the historical events that the poet described from March 1917 to the end of the Civil War, in the praise of the revolutionary people, or in the satirical depiction of the enemy, we will feel this journalistic passion. The last chapter of this poem, expressing the lyrical hymn full of happiness that the Soviet people must have, became an unparalleled example of Soviet lyric poetry.

In the famous lines "Soviet Passport," the poet expressed his own and all Soviet people's infinite love for the socialist motherland and pride in his own country: "Look! Envy! I am a citizen of the Soviet Union!"

Mayakovsky had been to Germany, France, Spain, Mexico, the United States, and many other countries. He returned from abroad full of new poems, essays, and correspondence. In these works, the poet passionately talked about the tragic fate of the working people living under exploitation and oppression. In "Black and White," "Mexico," and other poems, Mayakovsky wrote painfully about the unfortunate experiences of various nations suffering from imperialist oppression.

The poet's humanism is also manifested in his tireless exposure of war-makers. He and Gorky were the world's most brilliant defenders of peace. "On the whole planet, comrades, you declare! No war!" This is Mayakovsky's call to inspire the people of the world.

Twenty-three years have passed since the poet's death. But in these years, Mayakovsky's voice has not only not disappeared, but on the contrary, his voice has become more magnificent. In our present situation, the colossus of the best and most genius poet of the Soviet era is becoming more and more great, his poetic achievements are becoming more and more intimately felt, and his poetic achievements are having an ever-increasing influence on Soviet poetic creation.

    苏维埃诗人弗拉吉米尔·马雅可夫斯基
    苏联  伏·尼科拉耶夫
    苏维埃的社会主义时代给世界诞生了弗拉吉米尔·马雅可夫斯基——一位伟大的革命的语言艺术家。热情的苏维埃的爱国者，共产党的鼓舞的歌手马雅可夫斯基把自己全部的“诗人的响亮的力量”都献给了争取共产主义胜利的斗争。
    弗·马雅可夫斯基体现出新型文学家的优秀品质。他是诗人，煽动家，卓越的苏维埃的讽刺家，社会活动家，共产党伟大思想的热烈的宣传者和鼓舞者。在他最好的作品——新生活之歌中，诗一样地概括了摧毁旧的和建设新的，社会主义制度的一个宏伟时代的特点。
    一八九三年，弗·马雅可夫斯基生于库塔依斯科省巴格达奇村的一位林务区长的家中。一九○八年，一个十五岁的孩子的他，就已接近了布尔什维克。他做过宣传工作，为此三度被捕。到莫斯科以后，马雅可夫斯基在学校里学习绘画、雕刻和建筑学，因为未来主义的“左倾”而被校方开除。
    马雅可夫斯基的创作道路并不是轻易的道路，他有过一些错误，而且走过弯路，特别是在他参加革命活动时期以前。但就在这个时期，马雅可夫斯基的创作中，也已表现出对资产阶级、地主阶级制度的愤怒感和不倦地寻找艺术中的新道路的精神。
    诗人自己曾说明他在革命以前时期的作品“穿袴子的云”的意义，就是对资产阶级的道德的反抗，对下贱的资产阶级艺术和一切奴役和暴力制度的反抗。在另一个革命前的优秀作品“战争与和平”中，诗人严厉地反对世界帝国主义的大屠杀，说明了战争对于劳动人民是毫无意义的。
    值得注意的就是：马雅可夫斯基在革命前就和“革命的海燕”、伟大的无产阶级作家高尔基的意见很相投合。高尔基认为青年马雅可夫斯基是一位最有才华的诗人，曾给他的全部创作以积极的支持和深厚的影响。
    马雅可夫斯基热烈地参加了伟大的十月社会主义革命。“我的革命”—他这样宣布过。诗人认为自己是被革命所动员所号召起来的。在这些年月中，他创作了大量的使人鼓舞的诗歌，著名的有：“左翼进行曲”、“革命的颂歌”、“关于一个愚蠢的老太婆谈论伏兰格里的故事”、“给艺术军团的命令”和其他作品，他在戏剧界工作过，创作了第一个革命的戏剧“滑稽宗教剧”，他写了一个电影剧本“在前线”，而且参加过摄影工作。
    不仅是诗人，而且也是艺术家的马雅可夫斯基，是用诗人的语言和笔为革命事业而战斗的。在内战期间，马雅可夫斯基在俄国电讯社工作，他在这里创造了连环的鼓动宣传画——“罗斯塔之窗”。马雅可夫斯基曾创造了近五百幅宣传画，这些宣传画成为了现代苏联鼓动宣传画的榜样。
    应该说，马雅可夫斯基是革命的歌手。革命不仅成为他全部创作的最大的主题，而且也成为他的诗创作中最主要的境界。
    马雅可夫斯基和高尔基、杰米扬·别德内依、塞拉菲摩维奇一起，站在苏联文学、社会主义现实主义文学的前列。在他的诗里，异常丰满地表现出社会主义现实主义的创作方法。这种方法要求艺术家们正确地、历史地具体描写革命发展中的现实。
    苏联的实际情况在其急速的革命发展中每时每刻都在证明，人民对自由的、创造的和愉快的生活的朝夕思慕的理想怎样成为现实。这也就是诗人自己的最好的希望和理想的体现。正因为这样，周围的生活对马雅可夫斯基来说，就是鼓舞他的有力的泉源。
    和平的社会主义劳动的调子贯穿着马雅可夫斯基的全部创作。他写了一首关于采得第一批矿石的库尔斯克的工人们的诗，他为这个和平的建设性劳动中的第一个重大胜利而高兴，这些诗有：“铸工伊万·科吉列夫搬进新住宅的故事”、“关于库兹涅茨克工程和库兹涅茨克人们的故事”及其他。
    在他的作品中，如“开会迷”、“勤勉的仆人”、“伪君子”、讽刺剧本“臭虫”和“浴室”，他以无情的讽刺的火焰烧毁生活中的一切坏的、腐朽的、僵化了的、以及阻碍前进的一切事物。
    列宁读了讽刺诗“开会迷”之后（这首诗里严厉批评了许多机关中的那种会议频繁的情况），曾给他一个好的评价。这个批评对马雅可夫斯基的创作的进一步兴盛是具有重大的意义的，领袖的话使诗人相信他所选择的道路是正确的，使他相信艺术家接触生活是为人民服务的最有效果的形式。
    马雅可夫斯基在二十年代中期所创作的两首诗：“弗拉吉米尔·伊里奇·列宁”（一九二四年）和
    “好！”（一九二七年）是他的创作的顶峰。马雅可夫斯基在苏联诗歌中首先为先进人类的领袖和世界上第一个社会主义国家的组织者创造了宏伟的诗的纪念像，“弗拉吉米尔·伊里奇·列宁”这首诗——可以说是波澜壮阔的史诗，同时又可以说是抒情诗的作品——是以具有世界意义的历史性事件为背景的，创造出来的列宁的形象。在这首诗里，列宁的生活和活动是在与工人运动、与光荣的共产党的不可分割的有机的联系中表现出来的。马雅可夫斯基就在弗拉吉米尔·伊里奇的形象中，巧妙地把伟大性和朴素性结合起来，因此，这个形象给人以特殊的亲切、朴实、温暖、人情的感受。
    马雅可夫斯基为十月革命十周年所写的纪念诗“好！”，同“弗拉吉米尔·伊里奇·列宁”一样，是苏联诗创作的顶峰。马雅可夫斯基在这首诗里不仅谈到了伟大十月革命的历史，而且也反映出在苏联胜利地建设社会主义的历史，激动的政治热情深入了他的全部作品。无论在诗人从一九一七年三月到内战结束期间所描写的一些历史事件中，在赞扬革命的人民和讽刺地描绘敌人中，我们都会感触到这种政论的激情。这首诗的最后一章，表现出苏联人民必有的那种充满了幸福之感的抒情诗的礼赞，成为无可伦比的苏联抒情诗的榜样。
    诗人在著名诗句“苏联护照”中，表现出自己和全体苏联人民对社会主义祖国的无限的热爱和为自己祖国而自豪的心情：“看吧！羡慕吧！我是苏联的公民！”
    马雅可夫斯基曾到过德国、法国、西班牙、墨西哥、美国以及其他许多国家。他满载新的诗歌、随笔和通讯从国外归来。诗人在这些作品中热情地谈到在剥削压榨下生活着的劳动人民的悲惨命运。马雅可夫斯基在“黑人和白种人”、“墨西哥”和其他的诗篇里，十分痛苦地写出了遭受帝国主义压迫的各民族的不幸的遭遇。
    诗人的人道主义还表现在他不倦地揭露战争制造者。他和高尔基都是全世界最光辉的和平捍卫者。“在全星球上，同志们，你们宣称！不要战争！”这是马雅可夫斯基鼓舞全世界人民的号召。
    从诗人逝世以来二十三年过去了。但是在这些年中，马雅可夫斯基的声音不仅没有消失，而且相反地，他的声音愈加壮阔了。在我们今天的情况里，苏维埃时代最好的、天才的诗人的巨像愈益显得伟大，他的诗的功绩愈益为人亲切感到，他的诗的功绩对于苏联诗创作的影响是愈来愈大的。
