Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th. McCarthy, chairman of the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, with the support of the State Department, is expanding his campaign to "purge" books from American libraries abroad.

    The testimony given last week by Richard Humphrey, Deputy Director of the United States Information Agency, revealing the names of some of the authors whose books have been "purged" under the direct instruction of US Secretary of State Dulles, included: the chairman of the American Communist Party, Foster; the famous Soviet writer Ehrenburg; the famous scientist Lysenko; Gorky; and the famous American writers John Reed and Agnes Smedley, involving more than twenty works, including Gorky's "Twenty-Six Men and a Girl", Ehrenburg's "The Tempering of Russia", Lysenko's "Heredity and its Variability", and Smedley's "Daughter of Earth". In addition, an even larger number of books have been "purged" according to a "blacklist" that has not yet been made public. Humphrey said that according to a series of instructions from the State Department, the works of anyone who "believes in communism" will be banned from American libraries abroad.
    According to news agency reports, the US State Department has instructed one hundred and eighty-nine American libraries abroad to submit lists of the authors and titles of all their books by August 1st, in order to further conduct "purges".
    This fascist action by the American reactionaries has left the administrators of American libraries abroad panicked and at a loss. USIA Director Johnson said that some administrators of American libraries abroad, for "insurance" purposes, "removed too many books". He said while testifying before the House Appropriations Committee that the State Department's instructions to "purge" books left his staff unsure of what to do. Johnson himself resigned from his position as Director of the USIA due to "health" reasons.

    美国国务院加紧进行法西斯禁书运动
    【新华社十五日讯】  华盛顿消息：美国参议院常设调查小组委员会主席麦卡锡在国务院支持下，正扩大进行他的“清洗”美国国外图书馆图书的运动。
    上周发表的美国国际宣传署副署长李查德·汉弗莱在国会作证的证词，透露了在美国国务卿杜勒斯直接指示下被“清洗”的书的一部分作者的名字，其中有：美国共产党主席福斯特、苏联著名作家爱伦堡、著名科学家李森科、高尔基以及美国著名作家约翰·李德和史沫特莱等，涉及作品二十余种，包括高尔基的“二十六个与一个”，爱伦堡的“俄国的锻炼”，李森科的“遗传及其可变性”，史沫特莱的“大地的女儿”。另外还有更大一部分书籍已根据尚未公布的“黑名单”予以“清洗”。汉弗莱说，根据国务院的一连串指示，美国国外图书馆中将禁止任何“相信共产主义的人的”作品。
    据通讯社消息，美国国务院已训令美国国外的一百八十九个图书馆，要它们在八月一日前就所有藏书的作者和书名提出清单，以便进一步进行“清洗”。
    美国反动派的这种法西斯行动已使得美国国外图书馆的管理人员惶恐不知所措。美国国际宣传署署长约翰逊说，美国国外图书馆的一些管理人员，为了“保险”起见，“撤除了过多的书籍”。他在美国众议院拨款委员会作证时说，国务院“清洗”图书的指示使他手下人员不知所从。约翰逊自己因“健康”关系而辞去了美国国际宣传署署长的职务。
