    The Immortal Warrior, Ren Xihe
    Ren Xihe, a Communist Party member and ammunition handler of a machine gun company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, is an immortal warrior. In the counterattack at Zuo Shou Dong Nanshan on the Eastern Front in June of this year, he used his own body as the gun mount for a heavy machine gun, sustaining seven wounds but refusing to leave the front line, powerfully supporting the attack of our assault troops.
    Ren Xihe is twenty-five years old this year and is an ammunition handler in a machine gun company of a certain unit. On June 12th of this year, this machine gun company received the combat mission of counterattacking Zuo Shou Dong Nanshan. Ren Xihe handed his letter of determination to the Party branch, requesting the political instructor four times to give him the most arduous task. He wrote in his letter of determination: "I am a Communist Party member. I will learn from the spirit of Huang Jiguang in combat, and I will resolutely not leave the front line until the mission is completed."
    After the battle began, Ren Xihe closely followed the heavy machine gun, advancing towards the enemy-occupied main peak while firing. When the firepower of this heavy machine gun was suppressing an enemy firing point, the gun mount was suddenly hit by a piece of shrapnel and damaged, and the machine gun stopped firing. Bullets then fired wildly from the enemy firing point again.
    At this time, our assault队员were lying on the ground waiting for the heavy machine gun to cover their advance. Ren Xihe was very anxious when he saw this situation. He thought: How can the assault team lie on the ground and be beaten by the enemy without fire cover? So, he walked to the front of the heavy machine gun without hesitation and held up the red-hot barrel with both hands, regardless of everything. At this time, the machine gunner Yan Tianbao was afraid that he could not bear it and refused to pull the trigger, repeatedly advising him not to do so. But Ren Xihe did not release the hot barrel. He said excitedly, "I am a Communist Party member, victory requires me to do this, just fire!" So, bursts of bullets immediately flew towards the enemy firing point. The enemy's machine gun stopped firing, and our assault队员quickly jumped up from the ground and launched a brave charge towards the main peak occupied by the enemy.
    More than 2,000 bullets had already been fired from the barrel held by Ren Xihe. Ren Xihe's hands and shoulders were burned by the red-hot barrel, and many purplish-black blisters rose. Pain was tormenting him, but the iron will of a Communist Party member supported him. He shouted loudly, "Comrades, charge! Our proletarian fighters have backbones of steel, and we will fight the enemy to the end, even with our last breath!" The assault队员continued to advance bravely under the cover of the machine gun held by Ren Xihe.
    The platoon leader came and saw the blood flowing non-stop from Ren Xihe's back, so he immediately snatched the red-hot barrel from his hands and placed it on his own body. But after the machine gun swept towards the enemy for a while, Ren Xihe immediately snatched the barrel back from the platoon leader and said kindly to the platoon leader: "Let me do it! You are the commander and must direct the entire platoon's battle."
    The troops continued to advance, and the machine gun held by Ren Xihe continued to deal fatal blows to the stubborn enemy. In order to eliminate the threat of this machine gun to them, the enemy concentrated their firepower to fire at Ren Xihe. A bullet broke Ren Xihe's left shoulder bone. But Ren Xihe bandaged the wound and then used his other shoulder to hold up the barrel, allowing the machine gun to continue firing at the enemy.
    Under the fire cover of the machine gun held by Ren Xihe, our assault队员quickly rushed to the main peak. Ren Xihe persisted until the end of the battle before he fainted. When the soldiers told him the victorious news of annihilating most of the 21st Regiment of the Li Chengwan puppet army and capturing ten enemy positions, his pulse was about to stop beating. He struggled to say his last sentence: "We must use heroic combat to defend our beloved motherland!"

    不朽的战士任西和
    中国人民志愿军某部机枪连弹药手、共产党员任西和是一位不朽的战士。他在今年六月东线座首洞南山反击战中，用自己的身体当作重机关枪的枪架，负伤七处不下火线，有力地支援了我军突击部队的攻击。
    任西和今年二十五岁，是某部机枪连的弹药手。今年六月十二日，这个机枪连接受了反击座首洞南山的战斗任务，任西和把决心书交给党支部，四次要求政治指导员给他最艰巨的任务。他在决心书上写道：“我是共产党员，我要在战斗中学习黄继光的精神，不完成任务坚决不下火线。”
    战斗开始后，任西和紧跟着重机枪边打边向敌人占据的主峰前进。当这挺重机枪的火力正压制住敌人的一个火力点时，枪架突然被一块炮弹片打坏了，机枪停止了射击。敌人的火力点里又疯狂地射出了子弹。
    这时，我军突击队员们正伏在地上等待着重机枪掩护他们前进。任西和看到这种情况，心中十分焦急。他想：能让突击队没有火力的掩护，伏在地下挨敌人的打吗？于是，他便毫不犹豫地走到重机枪前面，不顾一切地用双手托起了发红的枪筒。这时，机枪射手阎天保怕他受不了，不肯扣动扳机，并且再三劝他不要这样做。但是任西和并没有放松炽热的枪身，他激动地说：“我是共产党员，胜利需要我这样做，你尽管打吧。”于是，一串串的子弹马上又飞向敌人的火力点，敌人的机枪不叫了，我军突击队员迅速从地上跃起向敌人占领的主峰展开了勇猛的冲锋。
    已经有两千多发子弹从任西和托着的枪筒里射出去了，任西和被火红的枪筒烧伤了双手和双肩，烙起了很多紫黑色的血泡。痛苦在煎熬着他，但是共产党员的钢铁意志支持着他。他大声喊着：“同志们，冲呀！我们无产阶级战士是硬骨头，有一口气也要和敌人拚到底！”突击队员们在任西和托起的机枪的掩护下继续奋勇前进。
    排长走来看见任西和背脊上的血在不停地流着，便马上将发红的枪身从他的手中夺了过来，架在自己的身上。但等到机枪向敌人扫射了一阵以后，任西和马上把枪身从排长身上夺了回来，并且亲切地对排长说：“还是我来吧！你是指挥员，要指挥全排战斗。”
    部队继续向前发展，任西和托着的机枪不停地给顽抗的敌人以致命的打击。敌人为了解除这挺机枪对他们的威胁，便集中火力向任西和这里射击。一颗子弹打断了任西和的左肩骨。但任西和把伤口一包扎好，便又使用另一只肩膀托住枪筒，让机枪继续向敌人射击。
    我军突击队员在任西和托着的机枪火力掩护下，迅速地冲上了主峰。任西和一直坚持到战斗结束才昏倒下去。当战士们告诉他歼灭李承晚伪军二十一团大部，攻占敌人十处阵地的胜利消息时，他的脉搏已经快要停止跳动了。他吃力地说出了最后的一句话：“要用英勇的战斗来保卫我们可爱的祖国！”
