    Gaoma Township, Jianhu County, Jiangsu Province, Closely Integrates Elections with Production
    Cui Shichen and Li Baihao of the Jianhu County Election Committee, Jiangsu Province, wrote: Gaoma Township, Jianhu County, gained some experience in combining elections with production during the pilot work of the general election.
    The general election work in Gaoma Township began in early June. At that time, the whole township was ending the summer harvest and preparing for rice transplanting; however, due to a prolonged drought and lack of water in the rice paddies, the farmers' production morale was low, and the cadres lacked confidence in leading production. Both cadres and the masses had many concerns about carrying out the general election, fearing that it would hinder production. Before carrying out the pilot work, the county election working group and the township election committee first gained an in-depth understanding of the production situation and found that solving the problem of drought resistance and rice transplanting was the urgent demand of the masses. Therefore, they studied methods to lead the masses in drought resistance based on the specific situation and formulated a plan to closely integrate drought resistance work and carry out pilot elections during production gaps. After the working group cadres went deep into the masses, they widely publicized the principle of "organizing ourselves and conquering nature" to eliminate the farmers' widespread idea of waiting for rain; at the same time, they specifically organized forces to dig ditches to open up water sources. In this way, in six days, twenty-one ditches were dug, with a total length of more than four hundred and sixty zhang, so that more than one hundred and twenty waterwheels turned day and night, solving the problem of water shortage in three thousand six hundred mu of rice paddies. The farmers were very satisfied. During the drought resistance struggle, the working cadres paid attention to combining agricultural activities and carrying out general election propaganda work. They used various methods such as chatting with farmers and holding small meetings during production gaps to explain to the masses in a simple and concise way why the general election was necessary, who had the right to vote, and what kind of people should be elected as representatives. This was very effective and eliminated the masses' concerns that the general election would hinder production. The Daping electoral district carried out publicity through short and concise small meetings, with simple and clear content, explaining one or two issues each time, sometimes discussing drought resistance work first and then talking about the general election. The masses reflected: "The meeting time is short, and it can solve production problems and learn the principles of the general election. We have no objection to holding such meetings again." When many working cadres were helping the masses to transplant rice seedlings, they promoted the idea that the general election was the people's participation in government affairs and being masters of their own affairs, which was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and educated the majority of the masses about the general election. In order to take care of the production of the masses, the township election committee tried its best to adopt methods that were convenient for the production of the masses when conducting population surveys, voter registration, reviewing voter qualifications, and issuing voter certificates. For example, when conducting population surveys and voter registration, the method of cadres walking more and the masses walking less, delivering door-to-door and field registration was adopted, which was fast and accurate, and did not delay production. When reviewing voter qualifications, small meetings and individual reviews were also conducted in units of two or three households, and propaganda was carried out to the masses at the same time. All these practices were welcomed by the masses. The township election committee is now summarizing its experience to further mobilize the masses to deliberate on representative candidates, prepare for elections, and convene the township People's Congress.

### 江苏省建湖县高马乡密切结合生产进行普选

    江苏省建湖县高马乡密切结合生产进行普选
    江苏省建湖县选举委员会崔士臣、李白豪来信：建湖县高马乡在普选典型试办工作中得到了一些结合生产进行选举的经验。
    高马乡普选工作是在六月上旬开始的。当时，全乡正在结束夏收，准备插秧；但是，因为久旱不雨，秧田缺水，农民生产情绪低落，干部对领导生产也缺乏信心。干部和群众对进行普选工作都有很多顾虑，怕妨碍生产。县选举工作组和乡选举委员会在具体进行试办工作以前，首先深入了解了生产情况，发现解决抗旱栽秧问题是群众的迫切要求。于是便根据具体情况研究了领导群众进行抗旱的办法，并且制订了密切结合抗旱工作、利用生产空隙进行选举试办工作的计划。工作组干部在深入群众以后，一方面向群众广泛宣传“组织起来，人定胜天”的道理，消除农民普遍存在的等雨思想；一方面具体组织力量挖沟开辟水源。这样，在六天内，挖掘了二十一条沟，共长四百六十多丈，使一百二十部水车日夜不停地转动起来，解决了三千六百亩秧田缺水的问题。农民群众都很满意。在抗旱斗争中，工作干部注意结合农事活动展开了普选宣传工作。他们采用和农民聊天、在生产空隙时间开小型会等多种多样的方式，通俗而扼要地向群众说明为什么要进行普选，哪些人有选举权，应选什么样的人当代表等，收效很大，并且消除了群众怕搞普选妨碍生产的顾虑。大平选区通过短小精悍的小型会进行宣传，内容简单明了，每次说明一两个问题，有时先讨论抗旱工作，后谈普选，群众反映：“开会时间短，又能解决生产问题，又学了普选道理。下次再开这样的会，我们没意见。”许多工作干部在帮助群众栽秧时，宣传普选就是人民参加政府办事、当家做主的道理，深入人心，使大多数群众都受到普选的教育。为了照顾群众的生产，乡选举委员会在进行人口调查、选民登记、审查选民资格、发选民证等工作时，都尽量采取了便利群众生产的方式。如在进行人口调查和选民登记时，采取干部多走路，不让群众多走路，送上门、送到田间登记的办法，既快又确实，更不耽误生产。在审查选民资格时，也多以两三户为单位开小型会和个别审查的办法进行，并同时向群众进行宣传。所有这些做法，都受到群众的欢迎。乡选举委员会现正总结经验，进一步动员群众酝酿代表候选人，准备进行选举和召开乡人民代表大会。
