Xinhua News Agency, 11th. More than 34,900 students will graduate from national universities in the summer of 1953. They will gloriously participate in the great cause of the first five-year construction plan of the motherland. After liberation, the number of graduates from universities in our country has increased year by year, and this summer has increased by more than 5,800 compared with last summer.

Now, these tens of thousands of young students, scattered in various universities across the country, who have been nurtured and educated by the Party and the government for several years, are working hard on their final school studies, preparing to participate in graduation exams. At the same time, the state is also preparing to arrange appropriate jobs for each university graduate to serve the construction of the motherland. Because the state has already started the first five-year construction plan, a large part of the university graduates this summer will go to metallurgical, fuel, electricity, machinery and other factories and mines to take on design and construction work in basic construction and participate in production, and many people will also participate in the geological exploration work of the great motherland. This summer, university graduates assigned to industrial, transportation, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, finance and economics systems account for more than 40% of the total number of university graduates. Secondly, in order to meet the needs of the development of higher education and to train more specialized talents for the country in a planned way, about 18% of university graduates this summer will go to various universities as teaching assistants, graduate students, and to various research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as research interns. In order to better educate the younger generation, about 10% of university graduates this summer will go to secondary schools across the country as teachers. In addition, many university graduates will go to work in national agencies, organizations, hospitals, local state-owned enterprises and private enterprises across the country. This summer, the jobs assigned by the state to university graduates can basically achieve "integration of learning and application". However, at the same time, because the establishment of departments in higher education in old China was unreasonable, there are still phenomena that graduates of certain departments cannot meet the needs of the country and that graduates of certain departments exceed the needs of the country. For graduates of these departments, the state has also assigned them jobs that are roughly related to what they have learned based on the current needs of construction.

These tens of thousands of graduating university students are all excited that they can participate in the work of the motherland's first five-year construction plan. Many people have expressed to the school administration and the school's Communist Party and Youth League organizations that they will resolutely obey the state's allocation and will work hard in any region and any job position, so that they can become a contributing person in the great and glorious future of the motherland.

    全国高等学校在今年暑期中将有三万四千多人毕业参加建设
    【新华社十一日讯】一九五三年暑期，全国高等学校有三万四千九百多个学生毕业。他们即将光荣地参加祖国第一个五年建设计划的伟大事业。解放后，我国高等学校的毕业人数一年比一年增加，今年暑期又比去年暑期增加了五千八百多人。
    现在，这几万个散布在全国各个高等学校中，受了党和政府几年的培养和教育的青年学生们，正在紧张地进行最后的学校学习，准备参加毕业考试。同时，国家也正在准备为每一个高等学校毕业的学生安排为祖国建设服务的适当工作。因为国家已经开始了第一个五年建设计划，今年暑期高等学校毕业的学生将有很大一部分要到冶金、燃料、电力、机械等厂矿部门去担任基本建设中设计和施工以及参加生产等工作，也有很多人要参加伟大祖国的地质勘察工作。今年暑期分配到工业、交通、农林水利、财政经济等系统的高等学校毕业生，占全部高等学校毕业生人数的百分之四十以上。其次，为了适应高等教育发展的需要，和有计划地给国家培养更多的专门人材，今年暑期高等学校毕业生，将有百分之十八左右到各高等学校作助教、研究生，和到中国科学院各研究所作研究实习员。为了更好地教育年青的一代，今年暑期将有百分之十左右的高等学校毕业生到全国各地作中等学校教师。其他，还有许多高等学校毕业生将分别到全国的国家机关、团体、医院、地方国营企业和私营企业中去工作。今年暑期，国家给高等学校毕业生分配的工作，基本上都能作到“学用一致”。但同时因为旧中国教育高等学校科系设置不合理，还遗留下来有某些科系毕业学生不能满足国家的需要和某些科系毕业学生又超过国家需要的现象，对于这种科系毕业的学生，国家也都根据目前建设的需要，给他们分配了与所学大致相近的工作。
    这几万个即将毕业的高等学校的学生，都为自己能够参加祖国的第一个五年建设计划的工作而感到兴奋，许多人纷纷向学校行政方面和学校共产党、青年团组织表示，他们将坚决服从国家分配，在任何地区任何工作岗位上都会努力工作，使自己在祖国的伟大光辉的前程中成为一个有贡献的人。
