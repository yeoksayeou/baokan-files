    Wishing Success to Indian Artists
    Zhao Feng
    The performances of the Indian art delegation demonstrated the diligence and wisdom of the Indian people, and the few modern programs among them further demonstrated the Indian people's brave struggle for national independence.
    We saw several major schools of Indian dance: the graceful and elegant "Kathak dance," which is a North Indian school. Ms. Damayanti Joshi's performance displayed superb skill. The characteristic of "Kathak dance" is its complex and intricate rhythm, especially the use of foot movements to set off the graceful posture, rotating with the increasingly faster rhythm of the drums. The compelling drum sound mixed with the sound of the small bells on the dancer's feet, forming a very moving scene. The South Indian "Bharatanatyam" school believes that movement and emotion, music and rhythm are the basic elements of dance. "Farnam dance" made us feel the dancer's surging enthusiasm. Ms. Chandralekha Patel movingly performed the tenderness of a woman full of love: "Today my heart is full of love for you, my lord, please don't be angry, don't leave me." This type of dance is known for its ability to express emotions, and the dancer deeply expresses the emotions of the character in addition to the body movements. "Kathakali dance" is already a form of dance drama, and the dancer's facial makeup and masks accurately exaggerate the character's personality. With the accompaniment of singing verses, the dancer uses specific gestures to express the content of the poems. It is said that Indian dances originally mostly expressed religious content, and the enthusiastic "Bharatanatyam dance" also simulates the stone carvings in South Indian temples as the theme of the dance; but we have already seen "Farnam dance" depicting secular life, which harmoniously expresses the tender emotions of a lover with its inherent agile footwork and slow postures.
    In music, the Indian art delegation has also successfully maintained and developed national characteristics. The chorus "Mother, We Salute You" sung by all the friends of the delegation used the national musical language to express the spirit of sacrifice of the Indian people in the late nineteenth century for the national independence struggle: "Motherland, you are our mother, we can get all wealth, strength, glory and blessings from you, just like a child's wish can be satisfied in the mother." More moving is the "Peace Song," in which Mr. Dilip Kumar Sharma sang the simple wishes of the railway workers, the melody simulating the sound of locomotives, and passionately called on all peace-loving and progressive people to unite. The tune of this song is so similar to other Indian classical songs, tunes, and folk songs, but it successfully depicts the workers' strength and confidence: all peace-loving people around the world will surely unite and fight for peace.
    The dance and singing performances of the Indian art delegation provide an example of how a nation with an ancient culture can develop its people's art on the basis of its traditions. Let us wish the peace-loving and progressive artists of India to achieve even more brilliant achievements in the near future.

    祝印度艺术家们的成功

    印度艺术代表团的演出，表现了印度人民的勤劳和智慧，其中少数的近代节目，更表现了印度人民争取民族独立的勇敢斗争。
    我们看到了印度舞蹈的几种主要学派：优美、典雅的“卡达客舞”，是北印度的学派。达玛扬蒂·乔希女士的表演，显示了精湛的技巧。“卡达客舞”的特点是复杂错综的节奏，特别是用脚部的动作来衬托出优美的身姿，随着鼓声的愈来愈快的节奏而旋转着，逼人的鼓声夹杂着舞者脚上的小铃的响声，形成了很动人的情景。南印度的“巴拉纳殿扬”舞派，认为动作和情感，音乐和节奏是舞蹈的基本要素，“法尔南舞”又使我们感受到了舞者激荡的热情。钱德拉莱卡·巴特尔女士动人地表演了一个充满爱情的女性的温柔：“今天我的心充满了对你的爱情，我的郎君，请不要发脾气，不要离开我。”这种舞蹈以善于表情著称，舞者除了身体的动作外，还深刻地表现了角色的情绪。“卡塔卡利舞”已是舞剧的形式，舞者的脸谱和面具准确地夸张了角色的性格，随着伴唱的诗句，舞者用特定的手势来表达诗词的内容。据说，印度舞蹈原本大多是表现宗教内容的，热情奔放的“巴拉纳殿扬舞”也以模拟南印度庙宇中的石雕为舞蹈的主题；但我们已看到了描写世俗生活题材的“法尔南舞”，这个舞蹈以其固有的敏捷的步法和缓慢的姿势，和谐地表现了一个恋人的温柔的情感。
    在音乐上，印度艺术代表团也成功地保持并发展着民族的特点，代表团全体朋友们合唱的“母亲，我们向你致敬”，便是用民族的音乐语言，表现了印度人民在十九世纪末为民族独立而斗争的志士们的牺牲精神：“祖国，你是我们的母亲，我们从你那里可以得到一切财富、力量、光荣和祝福，就像一个孩子的愿望，可以在母亲那里得到满足。”更动人的是“和平歌”，迪利普·库马尔·萨尔马先生唱出了那些铁路工人们的朴素的愿望，曲调模拟着机车的响声，激昂地呼吁一切和平进步的人士团结起来。这首歌的曲调和其他印度古典歌曲、小调、民歌那么神似，但却成功地描写了工人们的力量和信心：全世界爱好和平的人们一定会团结起来，为和平而斗争。
    印度艺术代表团的舞蹈和歌唱的演出，提供了一个具有古老文化的民族可能在其传统的基础上发展其人民艺术的例证，让我们祝愿印度爱好和平的进步的艺术家们在不久的将来获得更辉煌的成就。
