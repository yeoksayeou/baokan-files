Shaanxi Province is actively promoting improved wheat varieties. It is estimated that the planting area of improved wheat varieties across the province will exceed six million mu this autumn.

　　In the "Bima No. 1" improved wheat variety area, covering more than 2.6 million mu across 30+ counties including Wugong, Chang'an, and Dali, the promotion work has been carried out effectively in recent years. Local farmers have personally experienced the superiority of this improved variety. Therefore, this year, the People's Government will no longer purchase or lend wheat seeds, but will mainly focus on organizing farmers to exchange seeds themselves. At present, the mass seed exchange work has been initially launched. It is estimated that farmers in the entire improved variety area will exchange more than 30 million jin of "Bima No. 1" improved wheat seeds. While organizing the exchange of improved wheat varieties, the staff of the agricultural technology guidance stations in the improved variety areas are imparting knowledge about variety characteristics and cultivation techniques to farmers, and helping to identify seeds.

　　In the low-lying and humid areas along the Jing River and Wei River, the "6028" improved wheat variety, which is resistant to wheat midges, has been promoted since 1951. By the autumn of last year, 11 counties, including Xingping and Zhouzhi, had planted 90,000 mu. This type of wheat has had bumper harvests for years. This year, the yield per mu has reached as high as 700-800 jin. In order to continue the promotion, this area will purchase 3 million jin of "6028" improved wheat varieties this year. Among them, one million jin were pre-purchased before the wheat harvest, and some have already been transported to areas severely affected by wheat midges for lending.

　　In the northern part of the Guanzhong Plain, which has a higher altitude and colder climate, the "Jinghui No. 26" and "Jinghui No. 30" improved wheat varieties have been successfully trial-planted. Now, the local People's Government is, on the one hand, handing over these improved varieties to farms for propagation, and on the other hand, signing contracts with specially invited farmers to let them try planting this autumn, in order to establish a larger area for improved varieties.

### 陕西省积极推广小麦良种

    陕西省积极推广小麦良种
    陕西省小麦良种推广工作正积极进行。全省今秋良种小麦的播种面积预计将在六百万亩以上。
    武功、长安、大荔等三十多县二百六十多万亩“碧蚂一号”小麦良种区，由于近年来推广工作做得较好，当地农民已亲身体会到这一良种的优越性，因此今年人民政府不再收购和贷放麦种，主要是大力组织农民自行掉换。现在，群众性的良种掉换工作已初步展开，估计整个良种区农民掉换“碧蚂一号”小麦良种在三千万斤以上。良种区内各县农业技术指导站的工作人员在组织掉换小麦良种的同时，向农民传授种品特性、栽培技术，并帮助鉴定种籽。
    在泾河、渭水沿岸低湿地带，抗吸浆虫的“六○二八”小麦良种从一九五一年开始推广，到去年秋季已有兴平、盩厔等十一县种了九万亩。这种小麦连年丰收，今年每亩产量有高达七八百斤的。为了继续推广，今年这一地带要收购三百万斤“六○二八”小麦良种。其中在麦收前预购的一百万斤，部分已开始运向吸浆虫严重的地区贷放。
    在地势较高、气候较冷的关中平原北部，“泾惠二十六号”和“泾惠三十号”小麦良种已经试种成功。现在，当地人民政府正一面把这些良种交给农场繁殖，一面和特约农户订立合同，让他们今秋试种，以建立较大面积的良种区。（新华社）
