Editorial:

    The statement made by General Nam Il, Chief Representative of our delegation to the Korean Armistice Negotiations, on July 19th, clarified a series of issues in the Korean Armistice Negotiations over the past week, allowing people around the world to further understand the truth of the current negotiations, thereby completely debunking the various rumors fabricated by the United States regarding the armistice negotiations. This statement, based on the negotiation records since the resumption of administrative meetings of both delegations on July 10th, quoted the US's responses and guarantees to the various questions raised by our side and announced them to the people of the world; at the same time, it stated: "In view of the guarantees made by the United Nations Command regarding the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, although our side is not satisfied with your guarantees regarding the prisoner of war issue, our side is still prepared to immediately discuss with you various preparations before signing the armistice agreement." This reveals the central issue of the recent Panmunjom negotiation meetings.
    What is the central issue of this period of negotiations? This is due to the fact that some warmongers in the US, especially the Syngman Rhee clique, brazenly violated the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our captured personnel, and openly opposed the armistice, clamoring to "unify Korea by force," which led to setbacks in the preparations for the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. In order to persist in realizing the Korean armistice and then peacefully resolving the entire Korean issue, our side cannot tolerate the destructive actions of the Syngman Rhee clique under the connivance of the United States. Under our side's insistence on making solemn inquiries to the US side, the US side finally put forward the necessary guarantees regarding the implementation of the armistice. The result of our side's efforts is that the negotiations can be restored to the preparations for the signing of the armistice agreement. This will undoubtedly greatly increase people's hopes for the early realization of the Korean armistice.
    Now, except for the point that the US's reply is still unsatisfactory regarding the recovery of our more than 27,000 captured personnel who were forcibly detained and ensuring that similar incidents do not occur again, the other guarantees of the US side can be accepted from their face value. That is to say, the US side guarantees that the Syngman Rhee clique will abide by all the provisions of the armistice agreement during the entire effective period of the armistice and will not in any way obstruct the implementation of the armistice agreement; the US side guarantees that the South Korean army will also completely cease fire within twelve hours of the signing of the armistice agreement and will withdraw completely across the line within seventy-two hours of the agreement coming into effect; the US side guarantees that if the Syngman Rhee clique engages in any destructive acts of aggression against the armistice, the US side will not provide any support, including support in equipment and supplies; the US side guarantees that when the Korean-Chinese side takes necessary actions to resist aggression and ensure the armistice, the United Nations Command will still maintain the armistice state; the US side guarantees the safety and work convenience of the neutral nations' personnel and the Korean-Chinese side's personnel who go to the South Korean region to work in accordance with the armistice agreement. These guarantees of the US side were repeatedly answered "clearly and unambiguously" by General Harrison, the chief representative of the US negotiation delegation, and are documented, of course, we should accept them at their face value. Because our Korean-Chinese side's policy of seeking a Korean armistice and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is consistent. We deeply understand the desire of the people on both sides in the Korean War and the peace-loving people of the world to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and all our efforts are for the benefit of world peace.
    However, we can only accept these guarantees of the US side at their face value. As General Nam Il said in his statement, "The Korean-Chinese side must hereby declare that the United Nations Command's guarantees regarding the South Korean government and its army's compliance with the terms of the armistice agreement will only be accepted at their face value." Therefore, it is also inappropriate to take an overly optimistic attitude towards the US's guarantees at present. All governments and people who eagerly hope for a Korean armistice must also closely watch the destructive activities of the Syngman Rhee clique, and must actively supervise the United States to fulfill its various guarantees regarding the implementation of the terms of the Korean armistice.
    Can the United States fulfill its various guarantees regarding the realization of a Korean armistice? This question depends on whether the United States continues its policy of conniving with Syngman Rhee. General Nam Il has clearly pointed out in his statement: "If the United Nations Command continues this policy of conniving with the South Korean government and its army, then both before and after the armistice, the implementation of the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement may continue to be disrupted." Judging from the current situation, the US government is still condoning and encouraging Syngman Rhee's die-hard attitude of sabotaging the armistice. The double act of Dulles and Robertson in the television broadcast on the 17th of this month once again proved that the United States has not made Syngman Rhee strictly abide by the armistice agreement; on the contrary, the United States continues to condone and encourage Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to sabotage the armistice. Robertson and Dulles's question and answer further illustrate this point. The United States is prepared to "terminate the meeting" when the political conference after the armistice is "indefinitely delayed"; then, as Robertson had already said to reporters on the 15th of this month, they will "take all actions that the situation requires." Echoing Dulles and Robertson's dialogue, Syngman Rhee issued a written statement again on the 19th, publicly saying that he only agreed to postpone his "original decision for a few more months." Even after General Nam Il's statement was published on the 19th, Syngman Rhee's Ministry of Foreign Affairs still claimed that South Korea's guarantees for the armistice had a "definite time limit." Syngman Rhee's ambassador to the United States, Yang You-chan, delivered a speech in San Francisco on the 17th, even more bluntly saying: "We will wait ninety days, until the political conference is held, and then we will wait another ninety days," after this time has passed, that is, when the Syngman Rhee clique does not achieve their goals, he said, "We will attack, and we hope that the United Nations will give us air and naval support." These various signs threatening the Korean armistice prove that it is absolutely necessary for the Korean-Chinese side to insist that the US side must effectively guarantee the implementation of the terms of the armistice. These signs must arouse the strict attention and high vigilance of governments and people of all countries in the world.
    The United States is not only continuing to condone Syngman Rhee itself, but also wants to drag in Britain and France to support its condoning policy. In the joint communiqué on the Far East of the US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting on the 14th of this month, it was mentioned that if the Korean armistice is violated, the three governments "will once again support the restoration of peace and security as members of the United Nations." What does this mean? The London "Times" reported on the 15th of this month: "US officials pointed out that according to the provisions of this unanimously agreed communiqué, once the ceasefire is violated, the three countries have a greater obligation to resume the war." This warns all governments and people with peaceful aspirations that they should no longer tolerate this extremely harmful policy of the United States from continuing. The "Indian Times" editorial on the 15th of this month said: "Now it is no longer a question of reaching some uneasy agreement with him (Syngman Rhee). There must be sufficient guarantees to ensure that he cannot disrupt the armistice in the near or distant future." The London "Observer" commented on the 19th of this month: "It should be announced publicly and unambiguously that if Syngman Rhee violates the armistice, the United Nations forces will fight him, disarm him, and use their own strength to make the armistice respected again in South Korea." This fully expresses the current public opinion of various countries' dissatisfaction with the United States' failure to strictly restrain Syngman Rhee from abiding by the armistice agreement.
    Obviously, in order to ensure that the Korean Armistice Agreement is indeed observed and implemented, the United States must resolutely fulfill the various guarantees it has already formally provided at the negotiation meetings and take responsibility for handling the legacy issues that it must handle. The US side must not continue to adopt a delaying attitude towards these unavoidable responsibilities and the guarantees already provided. What are the legacy issues that the US side must be responsible for handling? This is what General Nam Il said in his statement: "Your side has the full responsibility at any time to fully recover the prisoners of war who were forcibly detained and submit an account to our side. If your side still cannot recover this group of prisoners of war and hand them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission after the armistice, our side will reserve the right to submit this issue to the political conference stipulated in Article 60 of the armistice agreement for discussion. Regarding all the remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, in accordance with Article 4 of the second paragraph of the terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the detaining party shall hand them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at a designated location in Korea. In view of the South Korean government's statement that it refuses entry to Indian troops, our side believes that this issue must be resolved before the signing of the armistice, so as to promptly notify the relevant neutral countries and Indian troops to prepare in advance, and this issue should not be left to the Military Armistice Commission for resolution after the armistice." As for the various guarantees that the US side has formally provided at the negotiation meetings, the US side must absolutely be responsible for fulfilling them. The US side must absolutely be responsible for preventing any events of the Syngman Rhee clique continuing to disrupt the armistice from occurring. As General Nam Il pointed out in his statement: "We believe that if such a situation occurs at any time, the United Nations Command must strictly implement its own solemn guarantees based on the inspection and judgment of the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Commission, as well as the just demands of peace-loving people around the world."
    The Korean and Chinese people fully support General Nam Il's statement. We guarantee that immediately after the signing of the armistice agreement, we will abide by and implement all the terms of the armistice agreement. We are also determined, in accordance with the armistice agreement and the guarantees provided by the US side, to prepare to take anti-aggression self-defense actions when necessary to ensure the implementation of the armistice. We are willing to unite more closely with the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely support the implementation of the Korean armistice, and fight to the end for the peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue.

### 美国必须履行它的保证

    美国必须履行它的保证
    朝鲜停战谈判我方代表团首席代表南日大将十九日所发表的声明，澄清了最近一周以来朝鲜停战谈判中的一系列问题，使全世界人民由此可以进一步明了目前谈判的真相，从而使美国方面所制造的关于停战谈判的种种谣言完全破产。这个声明根据七月十日双方代表团大会恢复行政性会议以来的谈判纪录，引述了美方对于我方所提各项问题的答复和保证，公布在全世界人民的面前；同时表示：“鉴于联合国军方面关于朝鲜停战协定实施问题所作的保证，尽管我方对你方关于战俘问题部分的保证尚不满意，我方仍然准备与你方即行讨论停战协定签字前的各种准备工作。”这就把最近板门店谈判会议的中心问题揭示出来了。
    这个时期谈判的中心问题是什么呢？这就是由于美方一部分好战分子特别是李承晚集团悍然破坏战俘遣返问题的协议，强迫扣留我方被俘人员二万七千余名，并公然反对停战，叫嚣要以“武力统一朝鲜”，以致朝鲜停战协定签订前的准备工作遭受挫折。我方为坚持实现朝鲜停战，进而和平解决整个朝鲜问题，决不能容忍李承晚之流在美国纵容下的破坏行动。在我方坚持向美方提出的严正质询之下，美方终于对停战的实施问题提出了必要的保证。我方这一努力的结果，就使谈判能够恢复到关于停战协定签订前的准备工作上来。这无疑地将大大地增强人们对于朝鲜停战早日实现的希望。
    现在，除了关于追回被强迫扣留的我方二万七千余名被俘人员，并保证不再发生同类事件的这一点，美方的答复还不能令人满意以外，美方的其他各项保证，从其表面价值说来是可以被接受的。这就是说，美方保证李承晚集团在整个停战有效期间遵守停战协定的全部规定，不以任何方式阻挠停战协定的实施；美方保证南朝鲜军队在停战协定签字十二小时内也完全停火，并于协定生效七十二小时内全线后撤；美方保证如果李承晚集团进行任何破坏停战的侵略行为时，美方将不予以任何支持，包括不予以装备和供应上的支持；美方保证在朝中方面采取必要行动抵抗侵略、保障停战时，联合国军仍保持停战状态；美方保证按照停战协定前往南朝鲜地区工作的中立国人员和朝中方面人员的安全和工作上的便利。美方的这些保证是由美方谈判代表团的首席代表哈利逊将军一再“明白而不含糊”地作了答复的，是有案可查的，当然我们应该就其表面价值予以接受。因为我们朝中方面对于谋求朝鲜停战、谋求朝鲜问题和平解决的政策是一贯的。我们深切地了解朝鲜战争中双方人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的心情，我们的一切努力都是为了整个世界和平的利益的。
    但是，我们对于美方的这些保证，还仅仅只能按其表面价值来接受。正如南日大将在声明中所说的，“朝中方面在此必须声明：联合国军关于南朝鲜政府及其军队遵守停战协定条款的保证将只能按其表面价值而被接受。”因此，目前对于美方的保证采取过分乐观的态度也是不适当的。一切热望朝鲜停战的各国政府和人民，还必须密切注视李承晚集团的破坏活动，还必须积极监督美国履行它关于实施朝鲜停战条款的各项保证。
    究竟美国能不能履行它关于实现朝鲜停战的各项保证呢？这个问题就决定于美国是否继续它对李承晚的纵容政策。南日大将在声明中已经清楚地指出：“如果联合国军对南朝鲜政府及其军队的这种纵容政策继续下去，则不论在停战前后，朝鲜停战协定条款的实施均有继续遭受破坏的可能。”照目前的情况来看，美国政府仍然在纵容和鼓励李承晚破坏停战的死硬态度。杜勒斯和罗伯逊在本月十七日电视广播中的双人表演，再一次证明美国并没有使李承晚严格遵守停战协定，相反的，美国却继续纵容和鼓励了李承晚破坏停战的阴谋。罗伯逊和杜勒斯的问答，进一步说明了这一点。美国准备当停战以后的政治会议“被无限期地拖延下去”的时候，就“终止会议”；然后就照罗伯逊在本月十五日对记者谈话中所已经说过的那样，他们将“采取局势所需要的一切行动”。与杜勒斯和罗伯逊的对话紧相呼应，李承晚十九日又发表书面声明，公开说他只是同意把他“原来的决定再迟几个月去实行”。甚至于就在十九日南日大将的声明发表之后，李承晚的外务部仍然声称南朝鲜对停战的保证是有“确定的时限”的。李承晚集团的驻美大使梁佑灿十七日在旧金山发表演说，更露骨地说：“我们将等待九十天，到政治会议开会，然后我们再等九十天”，在这时间过去以后，也就是说在李承晚集团达不到他们的目的时，他说，“我们就进攻，并且我们希望联合国给予我们空军和海军的支持”。这些威胁朝鲜停战的种种迹象，证明朝中方面坚持美方必须切实保证停战条款的实施是完全必要的。这些迹象必然要引起世界各国政府和人民的严格注意和高度警惕。
    美国不仅是自己在继续纵容李承晚，而且还要拖住英法来支持它的纵容政策。在本月十四日美、英、法三国外长会议关于远东的公报中，曾经提到朝鲜停战如果被破坏的时候，三国政府“将以联合国会员的身份再度支持恢复和平与安全”。这是什么意思呢？伦敦“泰晤士报”本月十五日报道说：“美国官员指出，根据这个一致同意的公报的规定，休战一旦遭到破坏时，三国更有恢复战争的义务。”这就警告了一切抱有和平愿望的各国政府和人民，再也不应该容忍美国的这种极其有害的政策继续下去了。“印度时报”本月十五日的社论说：“现在已不再是和他（李承晚）达成某种不安的协议的问题了。必须要有足够的保障来保证使他不能在最近的将来或遥远的将来破坏停战协定。”伦敦“观察家报”本月十九日的评论说：“应当毫不含糊地公开宣布，如果李承晚破坏停战，联合国军队将与他作战，把他缴械，并以他们自己的力量使停战在南朝鲜重新受到尊重。”这充分表示了目前各国的舆论，对于美国不能严格约束李承晚遵守停战协定的不满情绪。
    显然的，要使朝鲜停战协定确实被遵守和执行，必须美国坚决履行它所已经在谈判会议上正式提供的各项保证，并且负起责任处理它所必须处理的遗留问题。美方对于这些无可推卸的责任和已经提供的保证决不能继续采取迁延的态度了。什么是美方必须负责处理的遗留问题呢？这就是南日大将在声明中所说的：“你方对于被强迫扣留的战俘在任何时候都负有全部追回并向我方提出交代的责任。如果在停战后，你方尚不能将这批战俘追回交给中立国遣返委员会，我方将保留将这个问题提交停战协定第六十款规定的政治会议讨论。关于不直接遣返的全部剩余战俘，按照中立国遣返委员会职权范围第二条第四款的规定，由拘留一方在朝鲜境内指定地点交给中立国遣返委员会一事，鉴于南朝鲜政府曾经声明拒绝印度部队入境，我方认为必须在停战签字以前将此问题解决，以便及时通知各有关中立国家和印度部队预为准备，而不应将这个问题留在停战以后交由军事停战委员会解决。”至于美方在谈判会议上已经正式提供的各项保证，美方更必须绝对负责履行。美方必须绝对负责防止李承晚集团继续破坏停战的任何事件的发生。正如南日大将在声明中所指出的：“我们认为，任何时候如果有这样的情况发生，联合国军方面必须依据军事停战委员会和中立国委员会的视察判断以及全世界爱好和平人民的公正要求来严格执行其自身已经提出的庄严保证。”
    朝中人民完全拥护南日大将的声明。我们保证在停战协定签字后，立即遵守和执行停战协定的全部条款。我们并且有决心根据停战协定以及美方所提供的保证，准备在必要时采取反侵略的自卫行动，来保障停战的实施。我们愿意和全世界爱好和平的人民更加紧密地团结在一起，坚决支持朝鲜停战的实施，并为整个朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗到底。
