Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant has cultivated a group of design talents in the three years of plant construction.

    The number of engineering and technical personnel participating in the design work of this factory has increased more than fivefold compared to the beginning of the plant's construction; their design capabilities have also been continuously improved through practical work. After completing the design of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, they will undertake the design tasks of China's larger-scale heavy machinery industry. Sun Yingluan, the head of the steel casting group and an engineer, is now designing a steel casting workshop that is twenty times larger than the steel casting plant where he used to work in Shanghai. However, due to his continuous efforts to learn in his work, he has successfully completed the preliminary design. Chen Shaowei, an engineer in the power group, recently used steam instead of electricity as the power source for the plant's air compressors and utilized the waste gas generated by the steam engine driving the air compressors as a source of heating for the factory area, saving the country 2.4 billion yuan annually. The young technicians who have just graduated from school, who account for the vast majority of the design personnel, have also quickly gained the ability to work independently. Wang Yangming, a fifth-grade technician who graduated from university only three years ago, is independently designing the factory's crane equipment, undertaking tasks that were previously generally handled by engineers. Wu Guangxiang and Chen Yaozhi, who just graduated from school last year, are also, under the guidance of engineers, undertaking the design tasks for the more than 8,000 square meter wooden mold workshop and wooden mold warehouse. The wooden mold workshop will be equipped with overhead cranes and more than 30 machine tools, and the production process will be highly mechanized. They have now successfully completed the preliminary design and are beginning to enter the more complex technical design phase.

    This group of heavy machinery industry design talents has grown up with the help of Soviet experts who constantly corrected errors in their work and diligently learned from advanced Soviet design experience. Over the past three years, more than 10 Soviet experts have made more than 100 important suggestions for the factory's design work. Each suggestion has made the designers deeply aware of the advanced nature of Soviet design thinking and design technology. For example, in the design process, the factory's designers mistakenly placed all factory buildings on the same level. When the factory revised the preliminary design in June of this year based on the new product plan, Soviet experts promptly pointed this out and personally helped collect and study various original materials, re-stipulating the area, location, and elevation of each workshop, and revising the original overall layout of the factory area. It is preliminarily estimated that at least 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork can be reduced in future construction. In the new preliminary design, the experts also used advanced Soviet technical standards to help the designers determine the types, numbers, and utilization rates of the main workshop machinery and equipment, laying the foundation for the smooth progress of the design, and thus enabling the designers to learn the principles and procedures that must be followed when designing a heavy machinery factory.

    In order to rapidly improve the design capabilities of the design personnel and accelerate the cultivation of reserve forces, the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government also expanded the factory's technical department, which previously also did design work, into the Taiyuan Design Office at the beginning of this year, directly under the leadership of the First Bureau of the Design General Bureau of the Ministry. The Design Office has also established twelve specialized design groups, including metalworking, forging, cast iron, steel casting, power, equipment, and general layout workshops, implementing a specialized division of labor. All personnel in the office, from engineers to interns, have clearly defined work responsibilities and scopes. In the work, an experienced technical person is specifically responsible for leading a certain number of young technical personnel, working and learning at the same time. In order to strengthen the overall concept of the design personnel and the atmosphere of mutual learning, they have also established a design review system. This also plays a significant role in the cultivation of design talents.

### 在建厂过程中努力学习苏联先进设计经验  太原重型机器制造厂培养出一批设计人材

    在建厂过程中努力学习苏联先进设计经验
    太原重型机器制造厂培养出一批设计人材
    【新华社太原十九日电】太原重型机器制造厂已在三年的建厂过程中培养出一批设计人材。
    现在，参加这个工厂设计工作的工程技术人员已比开始建厂时增加了五倍多；他们的设计能力也在实际工作的锻炼中得到了不断的提高。在完成太原重型机器厂的设计后，他们将担负起我国更大规模重型机械工业的设计任务。铸钢组组长、工程师孙英鸾现在所设计的铸钢车间，比他过去在上海工作过的那个铸钢场要大二十倍，但由于他在工作中不断努力学习，已顺利地完成了初步设计。动力组工程师陈绍维最近利用蒸汽代替电力作为全厂空气压缩机的动力，并利用拖动空气压缩机的蒸汽机所产生的废气，作为厂区暖气的来源，每年可为国家节省二十四亿元。占设计人员中绝大多数的刚从学校毕业的青年技术人员，也很快有了独立工作能力。大学毕业才三年的五级技术员王阳明，正独立地设计着全厂的吊车设备，担负了过去一般需由工程师担负的任务。去年才从学校毕业的吴广祥和陈瑶芝，也在工程师指导下，担负着八千多平方公尺的木模车间和木模库的设计任务。其中木模车间并将装备有起重的吊车和三十多台机床，生产过程是高度机械化的。现在他们两人已顺利完成了初步设计，正开始进入更加复杂的技术设计。
    这一批重型机械工业的设计人材，是在苏联专家的帮助下不断纠正工作中的错误和努力学习苏联先进设计经验中成长起来的。三年来，十多位苏联专家对这个工厂的设计工作曾提出过一百多条重要建议，每一条建议都使设计人员深刻地认识到苏联设计思想和设计技术的先进。譬如，这个厂的设计人员曾在设计中，错误地将全厂所有厂房建筑都放在同一个水平面上。今年六月该厂根据新产品方案修正初步设计时，被苏联专家及时指出，并亲自帮助搜集和研究了各种原始资料，重新规定了各车间的面积、位置和标高，修正了原有的厂区总平面布置，初步估计在今后施工中至少可少挖十万土方。在新的初步设计中，专家又以苏联先进的技术标准，帮助设计人员确定了各主要车间机器设备的种类、数目和利用率等重要问题，奠定了设计顺利进行的基础，从而也使设计人员学习了设计重型机器工厂所必须遵守的原则和程序。
    为迅速提高设计人员的设计能力与加速后备力量的培养，中央人民政府第一机械工业部也曾在今年初将这个工厂过去兼做设计工作的技术室扩大为太原设计处，直接受部的设计总局第一分局的领导。设计处并成立了金工、锻工、铸铁、铸钢等车间以及动力、设备和总布置等十二个专业设计组，实行专业分工。全处自工程师到实习员都规定有明确的工作职责和范围；工作中并由一个老技术人员专门负责带领一定的青年技术人员，一边工作一边学习。为加强设计人员的整体观念和互相学习的风气，他们还建立了设计会审制度。这对设计人材的培养也有很大作用。
