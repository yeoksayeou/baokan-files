    Continue to Strengthen the Struggle to Defend Peace
    Strive for Further Resolution of the Korean Issue
    A letter from the Branch Office of the Chinese Communist Party at the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute: On the morning of July 27, after the news of the complete agreement reached in the Korean armistice negotiations arrived, our institute decided to organize all working comrades to listen to the relevant broadcasts. At 10:30 a.m., comrades left the laboratories or fields one after another, gathering in the auditorium with great concern to listen to the broadcast. After listening to the broadcast, this major event became the central topic of conversation throughout the institute.

    In the discussions, many people pointed out that the achievement of the Korean armistice agreement is inseparable from the growing strength of peace-loving forces around the world and the unwavering efforts of the Chinese and Korean people to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. More importantly, it was the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side, bravely striking the invaders, that shattered the international adventurers' conspiracy to provoke a new war. Therefore, in celebrating the signing of the Korean armistice agreement, we should first thank the most beloved people for their meritorious service. Comrades from the rural work group, who had just returned from the countryside, assured us that they would work diligently in the countryside in the future and make contributions to helping farmers increase agricultural production; only in this way can we be worthy of the Volunteer Army comrades who are defending our peaceful and happy lives.

    Many people pointed out that the signing of the Korean armistice agreement is welcome and exciting, but we must not be complacent and should be more vigilant. On the one hand, we must oppose the United States continuing to condone Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the armistice and supervise the United States' compliance with and implementation of all the terms of the armistice agreement. On the other hand, we should strengthen the struggle to defend peace and strive for further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We scientific workers must strive to raise our political awareness, distinguish between friend and foe, and actively participate in the construction of our motherland.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    继续加强保卫和平的斗争
    争取进一步解决朝鲜问题
    中共华北农业科学研究所支部办公室来信：七月二十七日早晨，朝鲜停战谈判完全达成协议的消息传来以后，我所就决定组织全体工作同志收听有关的广播。十点半钟，同志们纷纷离开试验室或田间，怀着极关切的心情，聚集在大礼堂听广播。听完广播后，这个重大的事件就成为全所谈话的中心话题。
    在漫谈中，许多人都指出：朝鲜停战谈判之所以能达成协议，和全世界爱好和平力量的日益强大、朝中人民为争取和平解决朝鲜问题所作坚定不移的努力是分不开的；更重要的，是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，英勇地打击了侵略者，使得国际冒险家挑起新战争的阴谋被粉碎了。因此，我们庆祝朝鲜停战协定签订，首先应该感谢劳苦功高的最可爱的人。刚由农村归来的农村工作组同志们保证：今后一定要安心在农村中工作，在帮助农民农业增产方面做出些成绩来；只有这样才对得起保卫我们和平幸福生活的志愿军同志。
    许多人都指出：朝鲜停战协定的签字是值得欢迎和兴奋的，但是我们也决不能麻痹，更应提高警惕。我们一方面要反对美国继续纵容李承晚破坏停战，监督美国遵守和执行停战协定的一切条款；另一方面更应该加强保卫和平的斗争，争取进一步和平解决朝鲜问题。我们科学工作者必须努力提高政治觉悟，分清敌我，积极参加祖国的建设工作。
