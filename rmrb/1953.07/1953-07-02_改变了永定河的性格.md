(I) A Great Creation

The pre-flood season project of the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River has been fully completed. At the entrance to the Guanting Gorge, surrounded by mountains in the upper reaches of the Yongding River, a huge dam stands tall. It is like a historical monument, recording the great creation of tens of thousands of working people. The dam will cut off the torrent of the Yongding River, defending the Hebei Plain and the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, reducing the threat of floods to the lives and property of millions of people.

The situation at the entrance to the Guanting Gorge is perilous. High cliffs flank the narrow riverbed, with a steep slope. After the Sanggan River, the Yang River, and the Gui River in the upper reaches of the Yongding River converge on the Huailai Basin, the water flows like it's cascading from a rooftop, pouring through the gorge into the Hebei Plain. In the past, many beautiful villages and fertile fields were swallowed by it. But today, the magnificent dam, equivalent to a twelve-story building, will allow the torrent to obediently flow into the 490-meter-long tunnel on the west bank slope towards the lower reaches. At the entrance of this water conveyance tunnel, a 44-meter-high intake tower is being built, and eight high-pressure gates will be installed to control the flow of floodwaters. At the tunnel exit, a huge trapezoidal stilling basin has been built with reinforced concrete, which will reduce the scouring of the rapid flow in the tunnel. On the east bank of the Yongding River, people no longer recognize the old appearance of Guanting Village. Heroic stonemasons have excavated a 20-meter-wide and 431-meter-long spillway here. This is to prevent excessive upstream floods and untimely discharge from the water conveyance tunnel, ensuring the safety of the dam. The huge project of the Guanting Reservoir can control the water volume gathered here from 95 percent of the Yongding River basin, subjecting the rushing floods to control here. Standing in front of these huge buildings, people cannot help but feel the happiness and pride of living in the era of Mao Zedong.

(II) Dream to Reality

The Yongding River was originally called "Wuding River" (Unstable River). The emperors of the Qing Dynasty, unable to do anything about the rampant floods, renamed it "Yongding River" (Perpetually Stable River). But the river was still so unstable. Every flood season, the floodwaters carried large amounts of sediment and surged down, and the people on both banks had to reluctantly abandon their beloved crops and warm houses, guarding the dikes day and night in the wind and rain. And when the water was fierce, everything would be swept away. Let's look at the historical records: From 1912 to the time of liberation, in the more than 30 years, there were seven major breaches and floods in the dikes below Lugou Bridge, each time affecting an area of more than 300 square kilometers to more than 2,000 square kilometers. The flood invaded Tianjin twice, and the victims rowed boats on the streets between the tall buildings to escape. Although taming the Yongding River was the wish of generations, no ruler in history was able to do so. The feudal bureaucrats of the Qing Dynasty, in the name of controlling the Yongding River, squeezed millions of taels of silver from the people and filled their own pockets. When the flood of the Yongding River broke into Tianjin in 1917, submerging the "concessions" of British and Japanese imperialism, and the sediment silted up the Hai River, hindering the entry of imperialist ships into Tianjin, the Beiyang warlord government, under the urging of imperialism, established the "Shunzhi Water Conservancy Commission" to plan the governance of the Yongding River. In the end, they only sent people to Guanting for a look. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, there was also a plan to govern the Yongding River. In 1929, drillers were sent to Guanting Village, but they only drilled two holes and left. The Japanese came and also planned to build the Guanting Reservoir, but in the end, it did not materialize. The control of the Yongding River was clamored for so many years, but the Guanting Reservoir never had a single shovel of earth moved.

After the founding of the Central People's Government in 1949, it was determined to control the Yongding River and build the Guanting Reservoir. In a short period of time, people's dreams came true. Yan You, an old technician in his fifties who participated in the construction of the Guanting Reservoir, recalled the situation when he brought an old drilling rig to Guanting in 1935, and seeing the magnificent appearance of the reservoir project now, he said with emotion: "The people under the leadership of Chairman Mao are truly capable of moving mountains and seas!"

(III) Heroes of Moving Mountains and Building Dams

When the water conservancy technicians of the People's Government moved the drilling rig to Guanting Village, the local farmers showed suspicious eyes. They did not believe that the reservoir could be built. But when the sound of blasting the mountains rang out day and night, the outdated views of the old farmers in Guanting Village were shattered. On October 25, 1951, in the wilderness at the entrance to the Guanting Gorge, a strong labor army began to attack the rocks and gorges that had remained unchanged for thousands of years.

Hundreds of thousands of workers and laborers spent two long northern winters on the construction site. In the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius, in the snowy and windy late nights, the sound of passionate labor was everywhere. The first step in building this huge reservoir project was to excavate a 495.5-meter-long water conveyance tunnel for diverting water to build the dam. The diameter of the tunnel is eight meters, which is larger than the Qianmen Gate in Beijing. The heroes who excavated the tunnel fought against the rocks day and night with pneumatic drills. Stone dust sprayed and stones flew. When they excavated to the very hard tiger-skin rock layer, it took 17 alloy drill bits to drill a one-inch-deep hole. In the face of serious difficulties, the workers put forward the slogan of "learning the spirit of the Volunteer Army in fighting the American wolves and conquering the tiger skin." The old driller Liu Wanchun recalled his old skills and used a horizontal pneumatic drill to drill the tiger-skin stubborn rock. The work efficiency immediately increased from three inches per person per shift to one meter. The driller Lu Yonggao carefully studied the "lifting cannon" blasting method, which improved the blasting efficiency and saved explosives. They opened the tunnel and immediately carried out the reinforced concrete lining project. This happened to coincide with the flood season last year, and the flood level in the riverbed outside the tunnel had long exceeded the tunnel entrance. All the tunnel entrances were sealed off, but the heroic workers still insisted on working inside the tunnel. When lining to the top, in the eight- or nine-inch-high steel bar crevices, people could only squat or crawl inside to work. The concrete was sent up one basket at a time, and the top project of hundreds of cubic meters of concrete was poured in such arduous struggle.

The closure of the temporary cofferdam was the prelude to building the dam. That was in mid-December last year. The climate outside the Great Wall was minus 17 degrees Celsius, and the wind was blowing snowflakes everywhere. The laborers fighting on the temporary cofferdam, in order to strive for early closure and excavation of the dam foundation, led by model workers Ye Cheng and Zhao Zhike, jumped into the waist-deep ice water to salvage branches and establish the foundation, finally overcoming the severe cold and ice water, making the temporary cofferdam closed successfully. On the late night of December 21 last year, the flow of the Yongding River obediently listened to human command and flowed to the water conveyance tunnel.

The excavation of the dam foundation was an even more arduous battle. The five-inch-thick ice shell on the riverbed was removed, and it was dug down 22 meters deep until rocks were seen before backfilling. The deeper it was dug, the more groundwater seeped in. Many electric pumps supported the heroic laborers who were excavating. Once, the nozzle of a water pump broke, and the seepage in the pit surged. When the laborer Tang Liyi climbed ashore from the water holding the nozzle, he was already frozen and dizzy, but he was still vaguely shouting: "Has the nozzle been repaired? We can't let the water rise!" The heroism of the workers and laborers greatly improved work efficiency, enabling the dam project to progress rapidly. In just over three months, the dam construction task before the flood season was completed as scheduled. The dam, which is 35 meters high and 360 meters wide at the bottom, has been built. The front and rear slopes of the dam are also covered with neat and solid rock armor like fish scales, waiting for the arrival of the first flood this year. This great creation, mainly done with manual labor, made the foreign guests who visited Guanting repeatedly admire the infinite creative power and superior organizational talent of the Chinese people.

(IV) National Support, Friendly Help

The construction of the reservoir fully illustrates the role our state system plays in creating a happy life for the people. The work here is not done in isolation. During the one year and eight months of construction, Hunan's fir poles, Inner Mongolia's timber, Liulihe and Tangshan's cement, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Taiyuan's steel bars, and Northeast's section steel, about more than 50,000 tons of materials, gathered in Guanting from all directions. Twenty-six bulldozers and twenty-two sheep's-foot rollers from various water conservancy departments of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, Huai River, Qiantang River, Xingang, and Pearl River also "met" here. The powerful tractor team was the main force in rolling the dam. When the power was insufficient during construction, a 150-horsepower generator was immediately transferred from Wuhan University, and an old technician personally escorted it from Hankou to the construction site. When the transportation of materials for dam construction was urgent and a large number of dumper parts needed to be replenished, the Xuanhua Agricultural Implement Factory accepted this order. Coincidentally, the factory's power was cut off due to the overhaul of the Xiayuan Power Plant. The workers came up with a way to temporarily modify the generator of the car to drive the lathe, working day and night to rush to make dumper parts. The employees on the railway lines, as soon as they heard that it was materials being transported to Guanting, no matter how congested the transportation tasks were, they strove to complete them on time or even ahead of schedule. Farmers supported the construction of the reservoir, laborers worked heroically here, and at other times, thousands of donkeys carried materials and transported them to the construction site. A large number of technical personnel also gathered here. Technical workers who successfully completed the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and workers who built the Tianbao Railway in the Northwest Region came with skilled techniques; steel bar workers from Tianjin, scaffolding workers from Beijing, and stonemasons from Shanxi and Hebei also rushed here. During the most intense period of dam construction, more than 200 students from North China Industrial School voluntarily came to the construction site to assist in the work during their holidays.

In the construction of the reservoir, Soviet water conservancy experts Bukov, Shabaev, and geological expert Krotki provided sincere help and guidance on the planning, design, and construction of the reservoir, which is even more unforgettable. It was the Soviet experts who first proposed that an earth dam could be built in Guanting. When a collapse was discovered while excavating the tunnel, Krotki personally came to the construction site to guide the treatment method. In the engineering design, water conservancy expert Shabaev often provided specific assistance and guidance. Hao Zhizhai, director of the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau, said at a reception for foreign guests: "Without the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, achieving such great achievements would be unimaginable."

(V) Beautiful Prospects

Standing on the huge dam, looking at the surrounding hills and rivers of the reservoir, beautiful prospects are unfolding before our eyes. The surging floods of this year's flood season will be tamed in front of the dam. A huge "artificial lake" of 230 square kilometers will appear here. The lake will store 2.27 billion cubic meters of water, which is 567 times larger than the storage capacity of Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace near Beijing. Fish can be raised in the lake to develop aquaculture, and fruit trees will be planted all over the surrounding shores and mountains, and the continental climate of this area will also be transformed. At that time, people will come to this vast and beautiful scenic area to rest and tour, and can row boats on the calm lake. The farmland formerly submerged by the river will be restored, and the crops on the plains on both sides of the lower reaches can be irrigated in the rainless season. In the future, it is also planned to build a hydroelectric power station here, sending out huge currents to supply industry, cities, and rural areas. The endless water source in the reservoir can also supply industrial and urban water, regulate downstream navigation, and ships can sail upstream from the Bohai Sea directly to the capital. The people's capital will be more prosperous and beautiful with the water from the Yongding River. In the future, the Yongding River will no longer bring people disasters, but endless beautiful prospects.

On the high mountains on both sides of the construction site, the ancient beacon towers and the newly built dams face each other from afar. It is said that in the feudal dynasty, when the flood came, the beacon was lit on the tower, and the flood control official would ride a horse into Beijing to report the flood. Now, this era of arbitrary flooding is gone forever. The liberated Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have changed the character of the Yongding River, making it truly stable forever.

    改变了永定河的性格
    新华社记者　孙世恺
    （一）伟大的创造
    永定河官厅水库伏汛前的工程已经全部完工了。在永定河上游群山环抱的官厅山峡进口，巨大的拦河坝屹立着，它像一座历史纪念碑，记载着千万劳动人民的伟大创造。拦河坝将斩断永定河的巨流，捍卫着河北平原和北京、天津两市，使千百万人民的生命财产减免了洪水的威胁。
    官厅山峡进口处形势是险峻的。高崖夹着狭窄的河床，坡度很大，永定河上游的桑乾河、洋河和妫水河在怀来盆地上汇合后，水流像从屋脊下泻，通过山峡倾入河北平原。过去，多少美丽的村庄和肥沃的良田被它吞噬了。但是今天，相当于十二层楼房高的雄伟的拦河坝，将使洪流驯服地钻进西岸山坡四百九十多公尺长的隧洞里流向下游。在这个输水隧洞进口，现正兴建四十四公尺高的进水塔，还要安装八个高压闸门，管制洪水的流量。隧洞出口已经用钢筋混凝土筑成了巨大的梯形的静水池，它将消减隧洞里急流的冲刷。在永定河的东岸，人们再也不认识旧日官厅村的面貌了，英勇的石工们已在这里开凿成一条二十公尺宽，四百三十一公尺长的溢洪道。这是为了防备上游洪水过大，输水道宣泄不及时，保障拦河坝的安全。官厅水库的巨大工程，可以控制住从永定河流域总面积百分之九十五的地面上汇聚到这里来的水量，使奔腾的洪水在这里就范。站立在这些巨大建筑物的前面，人们不能不感到生活在毛泽东时代的幸福和骄傲。
    （二）梦想到现实
    永定河本来叫“无定河”，清朝的皇帝由于对泛滥的洪水无能为力，曾把它改名为“永定河”。可是河流还是这样的不安定，每到汛期雨季，洪水携带大量泥沙汹涌而下，两岸人民只好忍痛丢掉可爱的庄稼和温暖的房屋，日夜在风雨里守堤护防；而当水猛时，一切就都被卷去了。且看历史上的记载吧：自一九一二年到解放时的三十多年中，芦沟桥以下的堤防，大的决口泛滥即有七次，每次受灾面积由三百多平方公里到二千多平方公里。洪水曾有两次侵入了天津市，灾民在两边高楼的大街上划船逃难。根治永定河虽然是人们世世代代的愿望，但是历史上的统治者，却没有人能够根治它。清朝的封建官僚们，以治永定河为名，从老百姓身上搜刮去百万两白银，装满了自己的腰包。当一九一七年永定河的洪水闯进天津市，淹没了英、日帝国主义的“租界地”，泥沙淤塞了海河，障碍帝国主义的轮船进入天津时，北洋军阀政府在帝国主义的督促下，才成立了“顺直水利委员会”，筹划治理永定河。而最后，也仅只是派人到官厅看了一下。国民党反动统治时期，也曾有过治理永定河的计划，一九二九年曾派钻工到官厅村来，而他们，也只是钻了两个孔就走了。日本人来了，也曾计划修官厅水库，最后还是没有结果。根治永定河就这样叫嚷了多少年，官厅水库却始终没动过一锨土。
    一九四九年中央人民政府成立后，确定了要根治永定河，修建官厅水库。短短的时间内，人们的梦想实现了。参加建筑官厅水库的五十多岁的老技师阎有，回想起一九三五年他曾带着陈旧的钻探机来官厅时的情形，又看到现在水库工程雄伟的面貌感慨地说：“毛主席领导下的人民，真能够移山倒海！”
    （三）移山筑坝的英雄们
    人民政府的水利技术人员把钻探机搬到官厅村的时候，当地的农民们显露出怀疑的眼光。他们不相信水库能修起来。但当开山的炮声日夜地响起来之后，官厅村老年农民们陈旧的看法被打破了。一九五一年十月二十五日，在官厅山峡进口的旷野上，一支坚强的劳动大军，开始向千万年不变的岩石和山峡展开了进攻。
    成千上万的工人和民工，在工地上经过了两个漫长的北方的冬天。在零下二十度的严寒中，在风雪交加的深夜，到处洋溢着热情澎湃的劳动的声音。建筑这个巨大水库工程的第一步，是开凿长达四百九十五点五公尺的输水隧洞，以便导水筑坝。洞子的直径有八公尺，比北京城的前门洞还要大。开凿隧洞的英雄们，终日握着风钻机和岩石斗争，石粉喷舞，石块迸飞。他们开凿到非常坚硬的老虎皮顽石层时，打一公寸深的眼，就要用十七个合金钻花。在严重的困难面前，工人们提出“学习志愿军打美国狼的精神，战胜老虎皮”的口号。老钻工柳万春想起他的老手艺，使用横打风钻，凿老虎皮顽石。工作效率立即由每人每班打眼三公寸提高到一公尺。钻工卢永高又细心研究出“打抬炮”的爆炸法，提高了爆炸效率，又节省了炸药。他们打通了隧洞，紧接着就进行钢筋混凝土的衬砌工程。这时正赶上去年的伏汛期，洞外河床里的洪水位早已超过洞口，各个洞口都封起来了，英勇的工人们，仍然在洞内坚持工作。当衬砌到顶部，在八、九公寸高的钢筋缝里，人只能蹲着或爬着在里面工作，混凝土是一簸箕一簸箕地往上送着，而数百公方的混凝土顶部工程，就在这样艰苦奋斗中浇筑成功。
    临时挡水坝合龙闭气是建筑拦河坝的前奏。那是去年十二月中旬的事情，长城外的气候在零下十七度，狂风卷着雪花到处飞扬。战斗在临时挡水坝上的民工，为了争取早日合龙开挖坝基，在劳动模范叶成、赵致科的带动下，民工们都跳进漫腰深的冰水里捞树枝扎根基，终于战胜严寒和冰水，使临时挡水坝合龙闭气成功。去年十二月二十一日的深夜，永定河的水流驯服地听着人的指挥流向输水隧洞。
    拦河坝基础开挖是一场更艰巨的战斗。刨开河底五公寸厚的冰壳，一直挖下二十二公尺深，见到岩石才能回填。挖得越深，地下渗水越多，很多部电动抽水机支援着开挖的民工英雄。有一次，抽水机的龙头坏了，坑里的渗水猛涨，民工汤礼义从水里抱着龙头爬上岸时，已经冻得晕过去了，但他还在迷迷糊糊地喊：“修好了龙头没有？可不能让水涨上来！”工人和民工们的英雄气概大大提高了工作效率，使拦河坝工程迅速进展，仅仅三个多月的时间，如期完成伏汛前的筑坝任务。高达三十五公尺、底宽三百六十公尺的拦河坝已修筑成功。坝的前后坡面还穿上了鱼鳞一样整齐又坚固的块石外衣，静待着今年第一次的洪水来临。这个主要用双手劳动的巨大创造，使到官厅参观的外宾们，连连赞叹中国人民无限的创造力量和优越的组织才能。
    （四）全国的支援，友谊的帮助
    水库的建筑充分地说明了我们的国家制度在为人民创造幸福生活上所显示的作用。这里的工作并不是孤单进行的。在一年零八个月的施工过程中，湖南的杉杆，内蒙的木材，琉璃河和唐山的水泥，天津、上海、太原的钢筋，东北的型钢，约有五万多吨的器材，从四面八方汇集到了官厅。黄河、长江、淮河、钱塘江、新港和珠江各个水利部门的二十六部推土机和二十二部羊角辗，也在这里“会师”，强大的拖拉机大队，是拦河坝辗压的主力军。当施工中动力不足时，一部一百五十匹马力的发电机，立即从武汉大学调来，一位老技工还亲自从汉口护送到工地。正在筑坝运料紧急的时候，需要补充大批斗车零件，宣化市农具厂接受了这批定货任务，可巧该厂动力因下花园发电厂检修而停电，工人们就想法找窍门临时改装汽车的发电机，带动车床，日夜不停地赶制斗车零件。铁路线上的员工们，一听是运往官厅的物资，不论运输任务怎样拥挤，都争取按时甚至提前完成。农民们为支援水库的建设，民工们在这里英勇地劳动，另外一些时候，有成千头的毛驴驮着物料，向工地输送。大批的技术人员也集中到这里来了。胜利完成荆江分洪工程的技术工人和修筑西北区天宝铁路的工人，带着熟练的技术来了；天津的钢筋工，北京的棚工，山西、河北的石工也赶来了。正当拦河坝施工最紧张的时期，华北工业学校二百多名学生利用他们的假期，自愿来到工地协助工作。
    水库建筑中，苏联水利专家布可夫、沙巴耶夫和地质专家克罗特基等，对水库的规划、设计、施工等方面的亲切帮助和指导，更使人们难以忘怀。在官厅地方能够修土坝，是苏联专家首先提出来的。开凿隧洞发现坍方时，克罗特基亲来工地指导处理方法。在工程设计上，水利专家沙巴耶夫经常地具体帮助指导。官厅水库工程局局长郝执斋在一次外宾参观的招待会上说：“如果没有苏联先进经验的指导，获得如此巨大的成就是不可设想的。”
    （五）美好的远景
    站在巨大的拦河坝上，遥望水库周围的山岗和河流，美好的远景就展现在眼前。今年伏汛期的汹涌洪水，将在坝前驯服，在这里将会出现二百三十平方公里的巨大“人造湖”，湖里将蓄存二十二亿七千万立方公尺的水，这些水较北京近郊颐和园里昆明湖的蓄水量大五百六十七倍。湖里可以养鱼发展水产，周围的岸边和山野将遍植果树，这一带大陆性的气候也将得到改造。到那时，人们将会来到这个广阔幽美的风景区休憩游览，可以在平静的湖面上划船。从前被河水淹没的农田将被恢复，下游两岸平原上的庄稼，在缺雨的季节将可得到灌溉。将来，这里还计划建造水力发电站，送出巨大的电流，供给工业、城市和农村使用。水库里无尽的水源又可供应工业和城市用水，调剂下游的航运，轮船从渤海进口逆航而上，直达首都。人民的首都得到永定河的用水将更加繁荣和美丽。今后，永定河带给人们的再不是灾难，而是无穷无尽的美好远景。
    在工地两边的高山上，古老的烽火台和新起的拦河坝遥遥相望，相传在封建王朝的时候，洪水一来到，台上就放起烽火，防汛官就跑马进京报汛。现在这个洪水任意横行的时代已经一去不复返了。解放了的中国人民在毛主席领导下，改变了永定河的性格，使它名符其实地永远安定。
