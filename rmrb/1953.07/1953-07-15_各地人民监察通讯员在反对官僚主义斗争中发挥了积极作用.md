    People's supervisors in various regions have played an active role in mobilizing the masses, exposing problems, and assisting leaders in promoting the struggle against bureaucracy. At the start of the anti-bureaucracy struggle, people's supervisory organs in many regions convened meetings of people's supervisors or group leaders to assign tasks for the struggle against bureaucracy. In early March, the Henan Provincial People's Supervisory Committee convened a conference of people's supervisors from directly subordinate agencies and factories and enterprises in the province and Kaifeng City; Guangdong Province convened a meeting of group leaders of supervisors from units directly under the province. At these meetings, the heads of people's supervisory organs at all levels explained the significance, policies, and methods of the anti-bureaucracy struggle and instructed the people's supervisors to study diligently, improve their thinking, connect with the masses, understand the situation, persist in the struggle, boldly expose bad people and bad deeds, and promote the victorious development of the struggle. Each people's supervisory group also studied and discussed how to participate in the anti-bureaucracy struggle based on the instructions of the people's supervisory organs and the specific conditions of their units, and formulated specific plans.

    After the anti-bureaucracy struggle began, people's supervisory groups in many regions used various mass meetings, forums, wall newspapers, and broadcasts to carry out extensive publicity and mobilization work, which played a significant role in raising the awareness of the masses, dispelling the concerns of some, and inspiring the masses to actively expose bad people and bad deeds. At the beginning of the struggle, some people in the China Sundries Export Company believed that "the company is newly established, and there are no problems. Even if there are problems, they have all been raised during party rectification." Therefore, they lacked enthusiasm. In order to assist the leadership in correcting these erroneous perceptions, the people's supervisor convened a forum at the section level. After mobilization and discussion, the masses' awareness was raised, and they actively participated in the struggle, successively exposing 125 problems of various sizes.

    In the process of exposing problems, the vast majority of people's supervisors demonstrated a serious and responsible attitude, disregarded personal gains and losses, persisted in the struggle, and won the support of party and government leaders and the masses. They overcame difficulties, combated elements who suppressed criticism, and assisted leaders in promoting the smooth development of the struggle. Initially, the leading cadres of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education did not pay enough attention to the anti-bureaucracy struggle, and they did not mobilize the masses well, planning to carry out this movement in only twelve days. The people's supervisor of the department actively raised objections to the leading cadres and also criticized them in the department's democratic wall newspaper and the Fujian Daily, which aroused the attention of the department's leaders, who re-mobilized and re-arranged the effort. The masses quickly took action and exposed many major problems within the department, such as the delayed payment of funds for eliminating illiteracy, which caused ideological confusion and emotional fluctuations among more than 3,000 teachers and 1,000 cadres involved in eliminating illiteracy; and the problems of certain cadres suppressing democracy and abusing their powers to arbitrarily suspend the work of teachers. The people's supervisor of the China Mineral Company enlightened the masses and took the lead in exposing problems, exposing a total of 85 problems, 22 of which caused a loss of more than 40 billion yuan to the state. Some leading cadres of the Henan Provincial Department of Transportation failed to hand over the remaining public funds after the "Three-Anti" campaign, engaging in extravagance and waste, and violating financial and economic regulations. The department's people's supervisor raised objections to the leadership several times, but was resisted and attacked by Liu Liangtai, the director of the office, who accused them of being a "small group," having "factional emotions," and "undermining the leadership." However, the people's supervisor persisted in the struggle and finally achieved victory with the support of the Party, the People's Supervisory Committee, and the masses, thus correcting the waste of state property; the factory leaders made a self-criticism and admitted their mistakes.

    People's supervisors in various regions also played a due role in assisting leaders in improving their work and improving systems during the anti-bureaucracy struggle. The people's supervisor of the Dingyuan District People's Government in Benxi City exposed problems such as the chaos in the cooperative system, discrepancies between accounts and goods, embezzlement, debt, and disunity among cadres in the district, after which the leaders were replaced. After democratic discussion, necessary systems were established, the cadres' morale changed, and a new atmosphere appeared in their work; the turnover increased from 50 million yuan per day to 70-80 million yuan, and at its peak even reached 200 million yuan; the cash flow also accelerated, from once every 32 days in the past to once every 14 days now, and at the fastest it could be turned over once every six and a half days. Daily settlement was also completed four to five hours earlier than before. The Wuhan People's Insurance Company blindly printed a large number of forms, and a total of more than 20 types became unusable due to system changes or were fundamentally inapplicable after printing, resulting in a loss of more than 90 million yuan of state property. After the people's supervisor raised objections, they assisted the leadership in studying the methods in detail, so that waste forms worth more than 50 million yuan were utilized. At the same time, in order to prevent similar problems from occurring, specific systems were also formulated for the future printing of various printed materials.

    各地人民监察通讯员在反对官僚主义斗争中发挥了积极作用
    在反对官僚主义的斗争中，很多地区的人民监察通讯员，在发动群众，揭发问题，帮助领导推动斗争的开展上，发挥了积极作用。反官僚主义斗争开始时，许多地区的人民监察机关都召开了人民监察通讯员或小组长会议，布置了监察通讯员在反对官僚主义斗争中的任务。河南省人民监察委员会在三月初召开了省、开封市直属机关及工厂、企业部门的人民监察通讯员大会；广东省召开了省属各单位监察通讯员小组长会议。在这些会议上各级人民监察机关负责人讲解了反官僚主义斗争的意义、政策和作法，并指示人民监察通讯员要积极学习，提高思想，联系群众，了解情况，坚持斗争，大胆地揭发坏人坏事，推动斗争的胜利开展。各个人民监察通讯员小组也都根据人民监察机关的指示和本单位的具体情况，研究、讨论了如何参加反官僚主义斗争，并订出了具体计划。
    反对官僚主义斗争开始后，许多地区的人民监察通讯员小组曾利用各种群众会、座谈会、墙报、广播等方式展开了广泛的宣传动员工作，这对于提高群众的认识，解除某些群众的顾虑，启发群众揭发坏人坏事的积极性，起了很大的作用。中国杂品出口公司在斗争开始时有些人认为“公司是新成立的，没有什么问题，即使有问题在整党时也都提过了”。因此劲头不大。为了协助领导纠正这些错误的认识，人民监察通讯员召开了以科为单位的座谈会，经过动员和讨论后，群众的认识提高了，积极地参加了斗争，先后揭发出大小问题一百二十五件。
    在揭发问题当中，绝大多数的人民监察通讯员表现了认真负责的态度，毫不计较个人得失，坚持斗争，取得了党政领导与群众的支持，克服了困难，打击了压制批评的分子，协助领导推动了斗争的顺利开展。福建省教育厅领导干部起初对反官僚主义斗争重视不足，没有很好地发动群众，计划只用十二天的时间来进行这一运动。该厅人民监察通讯员就积极地向领导干部提意见，同时又在本机关民主墙报和福建日报上作了批评，引起了该厅领导人的注意，又重新作了动员和布置；群众很快行动起来，揭发了厅内的许多重大问题。如迟发扫除文盲经费而引起三千多个扫除文盲教师和一千多个扫除文盲干部的思想混乱和情绪波动；以及某些干部压制民主，滥用职权随便停止教员工作等问题。中国矿产公司人民监察通讯员启发群众，带头揭发问题，共揭发大小问题八十五件，其中二十二件即造成国家四百余亿元的损失。河南省交通厅有的领导干部在“三反”后将剩余公款不上缴，铺张浪费，违反财经制度，该厅人民监察通讯员几次向领导上提出意见均遭到办公室主任刘良泰的抗拒和打击，说是：“小集团”，“宗派情绪”，“拆领导的台”等。但人民监察通讯员坚持了斗争，终于在党和人民监察委员会以及群众的支持下，取得了胜利，使浪费国家财产的行为得到了纠正；该厂领导人作了检讨，承认了错误。
    各地人民监察通讯员在反对官僚主义斗争中，对协助领导改进工作、健全制度方面也起到了应有的作用。本溪市丁源区区人民政府人民监察通讯员揭发了该区合作社制度混乱、账货不符、贪污、赊欠、干部不团结等问题之后，撤换了领导人员，经民主讨论建立了必要的制度，干部情绪转变了，工作上呈现了新的气象；营业额由过去每天五千万元增到七、八千万元，最高时竟达二亿元之多；现金周转也加快了，过去三十二天一次，现在十四天一次，最快时六天半即可周转一次，每日结账也较前提早四—五个钟头。武汉市人民保险公司盲目印制大批表格，因制度变更不能再用及印制后根本不适用者共二十余种，损失国家财产九千余万元。人民监察通讯员提出意见之后，协助领导详细研究了办法，使价值五千余万元的废表得到利用，同时为了防止类似问题发生，对今后印制各种印刷品也订出了具体的制度。
