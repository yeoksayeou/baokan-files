    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 22nd: The Korean Central News Agency reported: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has once again taken measures to reduce the sales prices of some daily necessities. This measure has been implemented starting on the 22nd. According to the revised prices, cotton fabrics have been reduced by 17 to 23 percent, rubber shoes by 32 to 36 percent, sneakers by 54 percent, and liquor by 23 percent. The reason commodity prices can be continuously reduced is mainly due to: workers launching patriotic production increase campaigns and completing the people's economic plan; the continued expansion and strengthening of state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives; and the enormous assistance given by the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries. The continued reduction of daily necessities prices demonstrates that the Labor Party and the Republic's government's consistent policy of improving people's lives has further achieved success.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 22nd: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Vice Minister of Commerce of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Li Dajin, spoke to a Korean Central News Agency reporter regarding the reduction of prices of some commodities in state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives, saying: This further reduction in the prices of daily necessities is a concrete manifestation of the Korean Labor Party and the Republic's government's policy of stabilizing and improving people's lives. Our beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the Korean Labor Party and the Republic's government under his leadership, have systematically implemented a policy of periodically reducing prices every year since 1947 during the period of peaceful construction, in order to continuously increase the purchasing power of the people, especially to continuously improve the lives of the working people. After the start of the war, while concentrating all efforts on supporting the front lines and strengthening the rear, the Party and the government also overcame all difficulties and took various measures to stabilize and improve people's lives. Therefore, the prices of goods in state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives have also been reduced under the difficult conditions of wartime, having been reduced three times from last December to now. Prior to this, in December of last year, the prices of daily necessities were reduced by 29 to 30 percent; and in March of this year, the prices of more than 50 kinds of commodities were reduced again.
    Li Dajin pointed out: Due to the impact of the reduction in commodity prices in state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives, market prices are also continuing to decrease. The continued reduction in the prices of daily necessities proves the superiority of our people's democratic state system and the correctness of the Republic's government's policies.
    Li Dajin issued a call, saying: All staff members of Korean state-owned stores and consumer cooperatives must further ensure the smooth circulation of goods; and in the work of improving people's lives and increasing people's welfare, demonstrate a high sense of responsibility and creativity.

    朝鲜再次降低部分物品价格
    商业省副相发表谈话说明降低物价的意义
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】朝鲜中央通讯社报道：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再一次采取措施，降低了一部分生活必需品的销售价格。这个措施已在二十二日开始实施。根据改订的价格，棉布类降低了百分之十七到二十三，胶鞋类降低了百分之三十二到三十六，运动鞋类降低了百分之五十四，酒降低了百分之二十三。商品价格之所以能够不断降低，主要是由于：工人们展开爱国增产斗争，完成了人民经济计划；国营商店及消费合作社继续有了扩大与加强；以及苏联、中国与各人民民主国家的人民给予了巨大的援助。生活必需品价格继续降低的事实表明：劳动党与共和国政府为改善人民生活而一贯采取的政策已进一步获得成就。
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国商业省副相李达进就国营商店和消费合作社降低一部分商品的价格事，对朝鲜中央通讯社记者发表谈话说：生活必需品价格的又一次降低，是朝鲜劳动党与共和国政府安定与改善人民生活政策的具体表现。我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅和他领导的朝鲜劳动党与共和国政府，在和平建设时期，从一九四七年起，每年都有系统地实施了定期降低物价的政策，以不断提高人民的购买力，特别是不断提高劳动人民的生活。党和政府在战争开始以后，在集中一切力量来支援前线与加强后方的同时，也克服一切困难，采取安定和改善人民生活的各种措施。因此，国营商店及消费合作社商品的价格，在战时的困难条件下也有降低，从去年十二月到现在已经降低三次。在这一次之前，在去年十二月，生活必需品价格曾降低了百分之二十九到百分之三十；今年三月又曾降低了五十多种商品的价格。
    李达进指出：由于国营商店及消费合作社商品价格降低的影响，市场物价也在继续降低着。生活必需品价格的继续降低，证明了我们人民民主主义国家制度的优越性与共和国政府的正确政策。
    李达进提出号召说：朝鲜国营商店和消费合作社的全体工作人员，要进一步保障商品的顺利流通；在改善人民生活和增进人民福利的工作中，发挥高度的责任感和创造性。
