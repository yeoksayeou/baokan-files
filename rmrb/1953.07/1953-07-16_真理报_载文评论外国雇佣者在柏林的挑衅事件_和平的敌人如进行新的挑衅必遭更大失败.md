Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th (TASS): Today, "Pravda" published an article by Zhukov entitled "A Plan Doomed to Failure."

Zhukov wrote that the more obvious the truth becomes that the Berlin adventure of foreign hires has met with a shameful failure, the more eager the open and covert instigators of this adventure are to conceal these obvious facts, or distort them beyond recognition. At the same time, in order to make up for the failure of this adventure, the reactionary imperialist forces have begun to conduct new provocations against the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democracies on a wider and more open scale.

In this regard, the reaction among broad international circles to the article "On International Adventurism and Defense of Peace," published in "Pravda" on July 6, which discussed the true background of the criminal actions of foreign hires in Berlin, is noteworthy.

"Le Monde" of Paris, reflecting the attitude of French industrial circles, felt it necessary to state that the "Pravda" article was an inevitable response to Dulles' and American newspapers' provocative remarks. "Le Monde" emphasized that in Moscow, "there is a calm and composed assessment of the situation." At the same time, many French and British newspapers have again raised the demand for a peaceful resolution of outstanding international issues through negotiation.

So what was the American reaction? The White House spokesman thought it best to simply tell reporters that they had no comments on the "Pravda" article. White House officials were not so careful with their words, but their opinions contained nothing new in substance; they merely tried, without any justification, to clear the United States of any connection with the June 17th events. American newspapers immediately adopted the same approach, followed by those Western European newspapers that listened attentively to every word coming from Washington.

What is characteristic is that American propaganda mentioned President Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference on July 1, when Eisenhower said that the United States had "no intention of taking 'actual (!)' actions" that could be considered as interference in the German Democratic Republic. However, the American and pro-American propagandists mentioned President Eisenhower's remarks on July 1 at least too rashly. Indeed, when you finish reading his remarks, the meaning you understand is exactly the opposite of what the speaker intended you to understand.

Zhukov emphasized that this remark can only be regarded as an attempt to encourage those unsuccessful provocateurs and inspire them to continue their destructive work, and cannot be regarded as having any other intention. Eisenhower said in a meaningful way that someone was willing to help.

The Bonn fascist group, which has been caught on the spot and exposed to the world, fully understands this hint.

Encouraged by his American "friends," Bonn Chancellor Adenauer hastily put forward absurd and adventurous claims in a formal government statement in the Federal Parliament on July 1, saying that the West German regime should be... extended to the German Democratic Republic.

Zhukov pointed out that all these stupid plans of the puppet Prime Minister would not be noteworthy if they did not so clearly reflect the wishful thinking of the "people" who, as US President Eisenhower said, were willing to help the Bonn adventurers. Of course, these people know that the conspiracy carried out by their hires against the German Democratic Republic is bound to be a disastrous failure. They fully know that the overwhelming majority of the people of the German Democratic Republic will condemn the shameless foreign hires who instigated the riots of June 17, and will raise their vigilance, unite around their people's government, and respond to their provocations with greater labor enthusiasm. But political adventurers do not listen to the voice of reason. They ignore the real facts.

Those who are willing to help saboteurs within the German Democratic Republic and other countries of the democratic camp intend to continue to wage a "secret war" against governments that do not agree with them. The Berlin adventure of June 17 was a scene in this war. According to foreign newspapers, the American side has submitted this issue to the US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting being held in Washington for discussion. We learned from a United Press report on July 11 about this issue that the foreign ministers discussed, as United Press put it, a general strategy of using (!) foreign hires to try their best to stir up riots in the countries of the democratic camp.

These days, representatives of the American ruling group and their West German servants are shouting loudly about "freedom," "liberation," and "free elections." However, for them, these words have completely opposite meanings.

The people of Berlin remember very clearly that those Texas-clad hooligans who came from the Western districts shouted "freedom" while very "freely" setting fire to clubs and cultural palaces, trying their best to destroy factories, looting peaceful residents, and engaging in wanton destruction and creating terror. Indeed, no matter how their masters repeat the word "freedom" now, everyone knows that in essence they mean enslaving the German people.

Since American newspapers these days are full of hostile remarks and openly announce the intention of the American aggressive bloc to step up its sabotage activities against democratic countries, Adenauer and his masters' loud cries of "peace" sound even more hypocritical.

Zhukov continued, it is quite obvious that these destructive conspiracies are closely related to attempts to undermine the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, everyone cannot help but pay attention to the fact that President Eisenhower avoided answering at the press conference on July 1 whether he had any hope for achieving a ceasefire. At another press conference held on July 8, Eisenhower did not give a clear and affirmative answer to this question either.

This is not accidental either. In the past two weeks, the American diplomatic and military representatives have been conducting so-called "negotiations" with their puppet Syngman Rhee, the purpose of which, if not to undermine the ceasefire, is to delay the realization of the Korean ceasefire.

Zhukov pointed out that the enemies of peace and international cooperation are making new attempts to obstruct the peaceful resolution of outstanding issues and to intensify the world tension that peace-loving people are trying to ease. However, these attempts everywhere encounter the firm, calm, and confident determination of the people of all countries to defend peace and prevent a new war.

The peace camp is not afraid of all provocations, maintaining iron-like composure, which has foiled the imperialists' plan to expand the war in the Far East, and has successfully concluded the negotiations on the exchange of prisoners of war, thus creating practical preconditions for the realization of a ceasefire in Korea. Despite the despicable provocations of the American puppet Syngman Rhee, the Korean and Chinese side are still resolutely and consistently fighting for the cessation of bloodshed in Korea and the peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue. As for the events in the German Democratic Republic, it is the same, despite all the provocations and conspiracies of the enemies of peace, the Berlin adventure of foreign hires has failed. The provocateurs from West Germany and their masters received a good and effective lesson on the memorable days of June 17 and 18.

The new policy of the German Democratic Republic government has increased the possibility of overcoming the division of Germany and unifying Germany into a free, democratic, and peace-loving country.

Zhukov finally wrote that the forces of peace are growing stronger, they are becoming stronger and stronger in the struggle, they are raising their vigilance, and they are gaining more experience. No matter what provocations and conspiracies the enemies of peace resort to, they will be equally doomed to failure.

    “真理报”载文评论外国雇佣者在柏林的挑衅事件
    和平的敌人如进行新的挑衅必遭更大失败
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：今天“真理报”刊载朱可夫的一篇文章，题目是“注定要失败的计划”。
    朱可夫写道，外国雇佣者的柏林冒险遭到可耻失败的真相愈明显，这次冒险的公开和隐蔽的策动者就愈是急于要掩饰这些显然的事实，或是歪曲这些事实使别人认不出来。同时，为了弥补这次冒险的失败，反动的帝国主义势力已开始更加广泛地、更加公开地对德意志民主共和国、对苏联和各人民民主国家进行新的挑衅。
    在这方面，“真理报”七月六日发表一篇谈到外国雇佣者在柏林的罪恶行动的真正背景的题为“论国际冒险行动和保卫和平”的文章，在广泛的国际人士中引起的反应是值得重视的。
    反映法国工业界态度的巴黎“世界报”认为有必要说明，“真理报”的文章是对杜勒斯和美国报纸的挑衅言论的必然反应。“世界报”着重指出，在莫斯科，“对局势有平心静气的估计”。同时许多法国报纸和英国报纸已经又提出了以协商方式和平解决悬而未决的国际问题的要求。
    那么美国的反应又如何呢？白宫代言人认为最好是干脆告诉记者说，他们对“真理报”的文章没有意见。白宫官员表现得不那么爱惜一字一句，但是他们的意见在实质上并没有什么新的内容，他们只是毫无理由地力图为美国洗清与六月十七日事件的关系。美国报纸立刻采取了同样的方针，接着那些竖直了耳朵听华盛顿传来的每一句话的西欧报纸也步其后尘。
    特点就是美国的宣传提到艾森豪威尔总统七月一日在记者招待会上的谈话，当时艾森豪威尔说，美国“无意采取能够被认为是干涉”德意志民主共和国的“实际（！）行动”。不过美国和亲美的宣传家提到艾森豪威尔总统七月一日的谈话，至少也太轻率了。的确，当你读完他的谈话，你所了解的意义正好与谈话者企图使你了解的意义相反。
    朱可夫着重指出，只能认为这次谈话是企图为那些没有成功的挑衅分子打气，并鼓舞他们继续他们的破坏工作，不能认为它有任何别的用意。艾森豪威尔耐人寻味地说，有人愿意帮忙。
    已被当场捉住，并揭发在全世界面前的波恩法西斯集团是完全了解这种暗示的。
    波恩总理阿登纳受了他的美国“朋友”的鼓励，七月一日在联邦议院发表的正式政府声明中急忙地提出了荒谬绝伦的冒险主张，说什么要把西德政权……扩大到德意志民主共和国去。
    朱可夫指出，傀儡总理的所有这些愚笨的计划，假如不是很明显地反映了如美国总统艾森豪威尔所说的愿意帮助波恩冒险者的“人们”的如意算盘的话，实在是不值得注意。当然，这些人知道他们所雇佣的人对德意志民主共和国进行的阴谋是一定要遭到惨败的。他们完全知道压倒多数的德意志民主共和国人民会斥责煽动六月十七日的骚乱的无耻的外国雇佣分子，并且提高警惕，团结在他们的人民政府周围，发挥更大的劳动热情来答复他们的挑衅。但是政治冒险家是不听理智的声音的。他们不理睬真正的事实。
    那些愿意帮助德意志民主共和国和民主阵营其它国家内部的破坏分子的人，打算继续对不合他们意见的政府进行“秘密战争”。六月十七日柏林冒险事件就是这种战争中的一幕。据外国报纸说，美国方面已把这个问题提交正在华盛顿举行的美、英、法三国外长会议讨论。我们从合众社七月十一日发出的关于这个问题的消息知道，外长们讨论了，如合众社所说，利用（！）外国雇佣分子尽力在民主阵营国家煽起骚乱的总战略。
    这些日子美国统治集团的代表和他们的西德仆从正在大声叫喊什么“自由”、“解放”、“自由选举”。不过，对于他们这些字是有完全相反的意义的。
    柏林人民记得很清楚，那些从西区过来的穿得克萨斯装的流氓一面大叫“自由”，一面非常“自由地”纵火烧俱乐部、文化宫，尽力捣毁工厂，抢劫和平居民，大肆破坏，制造恐怖。的确，不论现在他们的主子怎样地重复“自由”这个字眼，大家都知道实质上他们的意思是奴役德国人民。
    由于美国报纸这些日子满篇都是敌对的言论，并且公开宣布美国侵略集团要加紧对民主国家的破坏活动的意图，阿登纳和他的主子的大声的叫嚷“和平”听起来也就更加虚伪了。
    朱可夫继续写道，十分明显，这些破坏阴谋是与破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的企图密切相关的。因此，大家不禁要注意到这件事实，就是艾森豪威尔总统在七月一日的记者招待会上曾避免答复他对于实现停战是否抱有希望的问题。在七月八日举行的另一次记者招待会上，艾森豪威尔对于这个问题也没有给予明确肯定的答复。
    这也不是偶然的。在过去两个星期里面，美国的外交和军事代表一直在与他们的傀儡李承晚进行所谓“谈判”，其目的假如不是破坏停战的话，那么就是延迟朝鲜停战的实现。
    朱可夫指出，和平与国际合作的敌人正进行新的企图要阻挠悬而未决的问题得到和平解决，并使爱好和平人民尽力要缓和的世界紧张局势更加紧张。不过，这些企图到处都碰到各国人民拥护和平，防止新战争的坚定的、冷静的、满怀信心的决心。
    和平阵营不怕一切挑衅，保持着铁一般的镇静，这已使帝国主义扩大远东战争的计划落了空，已经圆满地结束了交换战俘的谈判，因此，为实现朝鲜停战创造了实际的先决条件。尽管美国傀儡李承晚进行了卑鄙的挑衅，朝中方面还在坚决地、始终不渝地为停止朝鲜流血，和平解决整个朝鲜问题而斗争。至于德意志民主共和国的事件，也是一样，尽管和平敌人进行一切挑衅，策划种种阴谋，外国雇佣分子的柏林冒险还是失败了。来自西德的挑衅者和他们的主子在六月十七日，十八日这个可纪念的日子里，得到了一个很好的、有效的教训。
    德意志民主共和国政府的新方针增加了克服德国的分裂和统一德国成为一个自由、民主与爱好和平国家的可能性。
    朱可夫最后写道，和平力量正在壮大，他们在斗争中正越来越坚强，越来越强大，正提高他们的警惕，正得到更多的经验。不论和平的敌人诉诸什么挑衅和阴谋，它们都会同样地遭到失败。
