    Using Living Examples to Educate on Labor Discipline
    Today's newspaper features the deeds of four workers: Gong Wenfa and others. Although these four individuals are located in different places—some in the Northeast, some in Shandong, some in Tianjin, and some in Beijing—and they have varying levels of experience—some are veteran workers with over a decade of seniority, some are newcomers from the countryside, and some are women who have recently emerged from their families since liberation—and they have different affiliations—some are Communist Party members, some are Youth League members, and some are neither Party nor League members—and they engage in different types of work—some are drilling workers, some are mechanical workers, and some are textile workers—they share a common characteristic: through years of diligent labor, they have achieved outstanding results and become role models for consciously adhering to labor discipline. The brief reports on their deeds once again confirm a truth: our nation's industrial construction has rapidly completed its recovery phase and entered a stage of planned construction precisely because we have hundreds of thousands of such workers in our factories, mines, and construction sites, working selflessly for the construction of a new life. Our entire nation should sincerely thank these millions of labor heroes.
    What can we learn from their deeds?
    Why are they able to consistently avoid absenteeism, tardiness, and early departures? Their answer is: individual absenteeism results in losses for the country; "If one person is ten minutes late, the whole factory has to wait for their work, and everyone in the factory is delayed by ten minutes because of them. How is this loss calculated?" With this awareness, they can overcome all difficulties and insist on not taking leave or being absent from work.
    Why can they avoid accidents and ensure product quality? This is because they recognize that accidents and defective products are a loss to the country. Therefore, they can consciously abide by technical operating procedures, meticulously care for machines and tools, and ensure product quality.
    Why do they all cherish their health so much? Because they do not regard their health as personal wealth, but as social wealth. They recognize that illness will delay production, so they consciously exercise and pay attention to hygiene.
    Why are they full of energy and not drowsy during working hours? Because they have devised many ways to ensure they get enough sleep. If there are many children in the yard, they publicize the importance of production to their families and mobilize the children's mothers to take good care of the children so they don't make noise.
    All of this is based on their highly conscious attitude toward labor. Where does their awareness come from? It is because they have drawn a common conclusion from their own lives: now that we have become masters of the country, we should strive to increase production and build the country well, "When production is good, the country is good, and we ourselves are also good." Their view of work has changed. As the female worker Yang Yugui herself said, during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, workers were constantly beaten and scolded in factories, so they saw working as suffering and a disgrace; after liberation, they regarded the factory as their own home, and they felt happy when they entered the workshop and saw the machines, and they were always thinking about how to find ways to produce well. As Stalin said:
      “The realization that the worker is working not for
    the capitalist but for his own state, for his own class—
    this awareness is the greatest and most powerful
    driving force for the development and improvement of
    our industry.” (Stalin: Conversation with the First American
    Workers Delegation, Selected Works of Stalin, Volume III)
    When everyone has this awareness, what difficulties cannot be overcome?
    Unfortunately, some Party organizations, trade unions, and youth leagues in our enterprises have long failed to pay enough attention to labor discipline, and therefore, they have also failed to pay enough attention to the diligent efforts of many worker comrades. Or, they have simply praised and rewarded them, but have not been able to seize these living facts, using their love for labor, love for the motherland, and love for the new life to educate and influence the broad masses of workers, leading all workers to raise their level of awareness and establish conscious labor discipline. On the contrary, they have been buried in many places, while a few lazy, indolent, and selfish elements have been indulged, allowing the evil spirit of undermining labor discipline to gain the upper hand, while workers who abide by labor discipline and work diligently are met with ridicule. This situation is clearly a serious shortcoming in our political work. In order to effectively carry out education on labor discipline, in order to launch a struggle against the phenomenon of undermining labor discipline, and to consolidate labor discipline, we must discover these unknown "ordinary workers" in every factory, mine, and construction site, establish the banner of consciously abiding by labor discipline, and call on the broad masses of workers to learn from them, to emulate ordinary workers like Gong Wenfa, Liu Meiqing, Guan Shangcai, and Yang Yugui!

### 用活人活事来进行劳动纪律的教育

    用活人活事来进行劳动纪律的教育
    今天报上发表了宫文发等四个工人的事迹。虽然他们四个人，有的在东北，有的在山东，有的在天津，有的在北京；他们有的是具有十几年工龄的老工人，有的是刚从农村里来的，有的是解放以后从家庭走出来不久的妇女；他们有的是共产党员，有的是青年团员，有的不是党员也不是团员；他们有的是钻探工人，有的是机械工人，有的是纺织女工。但是，他们却具有一个共同的特点：他们从长年累月辛勤的劳动中，创造出了优越的成绩，成为自觉遵守劳动纪律的榜样。从他们的事迹的简短报道里，又一次证实了一个真理：我们国家工业建设迅速地完成了恢复阶段，走上有计划的建设阶段，就是由于在我们的工厂、矿山和工地里，有着成千上万这样的工人，为建设新生活，忘我地劳动着。我们全国人民应当衷心地感谢这些千千万万的劳动英雄们。
    从他们的事迹里，我们可以学到些什么呢？
    为什么他们能够长期地不缺勤，不迟到，不早退？他们的回答是：个人歇一次工，就会使国家受损失；“如果一个人迟到十分钟，全厂都等他的活，全厂的人都要为他耽误十分钟，这个损失怎样计算？”有了这种自觉，他们就能克服一切困难，坚持不请假，不旷工。
    为什么他们能不出事故，保证产品质量？这是由于他们认识到出了事故和废品，是国家的损失。所以他们能自觉地遵守技术操作规程，百般爱护机器和工具，保证产品质量。
    为什么他们都那样爱护自己的身体？因为他们不是把身体看成个人的财富，而是把身体看成社会的财富。他们认识到生了病会耽误生产，所以他们自觉地锻炼身体，注意清洁卫生。
    为什么他们在工作时间内，精神饱满，不打瞌睡？因为他们想出许多办法，来保证自己有足够的睡眠。院子里孩子多，就向家属宣传生产的重要，动员孩子的妈妈们把孩子看好，不吵不闹。
    这一切一切，都建立在他们的高度自觉劳动态度的基础之上。他们这种自觉性是由哪里来的呢？这是由于他们从各人自己的生活中，得出了共同的一个结论：现在我们成了国家的主人，应该努力增加生产，把国家建设好，“生产好了，国家好了，我们自己也好”，他们对做工的看法变了。像女工杨玉桂自己所说的，在日寇、国民党反动统治的时候，工人在工厂里成天挨打受骂，所以把做工看成是受罪丢人的事情；解放以后，就把工厂看成是自己的家，一进车间看到那些机器，就觉得高兴，心里总是捉摸着怎样想办法好好生产。这正如斯大林所说过的：
      “觉悟到工人不是为着资本家作工而是为着
    自己的国家作工，为着自己本阶级作工——这
    种觉悟心就是我国工业发展和改善底极伟大的
    推动力。”（斯大林：与第一次美国工人代表团
    的谈话，斯大林选集第三卷）
    人人都有了这种自觉，还有什么困难不能克服呢？
    可惜，我们企业中某些党的组织、工会和青年团，长期以来，没有足够地重视劳动纪律，因而，也没有足够地重视许多工人同志的辛勤努力。或者，只是简单地表扬了，奖励了他们，却没有能够抓住这些活生生的事实，用他们热爱劳动，热爱祖国，热爱新生活的思想和行动，去教育和影响广大工人群众，领导着全体工人群众提高觉悟水平，建立起自觉的劳动纪律。相反的，他们在许多地方被埋没了，而少数怠惰、懒散、自私自利的分子却被纵容了，使得败坏劳动纪律的邪气占了上风，而遵守劳动纪律、埋头苦干的工人，却遭到冷嘲热讽。这种情况，显然是我们政治工作的严重缺点。为了有效地进行劳动纪律的教育，为了展开对破坏劳动纪律现象的斗争，巩固劳动纪律，我们要在各个工厂、矿山和工地里，发现这些默默无闻的“普通工人”，树立起自觉遵守劳动纪律的旗帜来，并号召全体工人群众向他们学习，向宫文发、刘美卿、管尚才、杨玉桂式样的普通工人看齐！
