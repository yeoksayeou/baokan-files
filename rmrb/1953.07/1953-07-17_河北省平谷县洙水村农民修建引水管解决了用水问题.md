    Villagers in Zhushui Village, Pinggu County, Hebei Province, Solve Water Problem by Building Water Diversion Pipes
    Letter from An Shuwen, Water Conservancy Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee: Zhushui Village in Pinggu County, Hebei Province, is a village in the old revolutionary base area in the mountains. The village has 326 households and 1,570 people. The terrain here is high, the climate is dry, and the underground water source is too deep. There is only one well in the village, which is 13 zhang deep, and the water source is insufficient, not enough for the whole village to eat and use. Villagers kept many donkeys to carry spring water from three li away; more than 30,000 man-days were spent on fetching water every year.

    This spring, under the leadership and help of the People's Government, the villagers began to build pipes to divert water. The water diversion method they adopted was both economical and simple: first, dig a ditch from the water source to the end point of water demand, with a depth below the freezing point. A "check tank" is set every 50 meters for inspection and adjustment. After the earth canal is dug, bamboo pipes are buried and compacted tightly with good soil (clay). The method of connecting bamboo pipes is to insert the small end of one bamboo pipe into the large end of another bamboo pipe, fix it with bamboo nails, and then apply white ash to seal the joints and tie them tightly with hemp rope. The method of connecting the pipe to the tank is to drill a hole in the tank first, extend the pipe into it, and then apply white ash to seal it. The water inlet of the "check tank" is higher than the outlet to prevent water from accumulating in the tank. In order to prevent the spring water from being wasted at night, a reservoir is built at the end of the pipe that can hold the amount of water flowing overnight. With the active efforts of the masses of the village, the water diversion project was completed on May 2. The project cost a total of 9 million yuan in materials and 2,000 man-days. The water problem that the people of Zhushui Village have been eager to solve for generations has been solved from now on.

    On the day when the spring water three li away flowed into the village along the water pipes, the farmers of Zhushui Village were as happy as if they were celebrating a happy event, and everyone scrambled to see the water. An old lady in her seventies pointed to the comrades of the working group and said, "You are all good cadres of Chairman Mao, this time you have cured our village's illness." Many people said: This time our donkeys can be used for farming.

### 河北省平谷县洙水村农民修建引水管解决了用水问题

    河北省平谷县洙水村农民修建引水管解决了用水问题
    华北行政委员会水利局安树文来信：河北省平谷县洙水村是山区老根据地的一个村庄。全村有三百二十六户，一千五百七十口人。这里地势高，气候干，地下水源太深。村里只有一口水井，深达十三丈，水源不足，不够全村吃用。村中居民为了到离村三里地以外去驮泉水，养了许多毛驴；每年为取水所用人工达三万多个。
    今年春季，在人民政府的领导和帮助下，该村农民开始修管引水。他们所采用的引水方法既经济又简单：先挖好自水源至需水终点的土渠，深度在解冻点以下。每隔五十公尺设“检查缸”一个，以便检修调节。土渠挖成后埋入竹管，用好土（粘土）围紧夯实。联接竹管的办法是：将一根竹管的小头插入另一根竹管的大头内，用竹钉穿住后再用白灰抹缝、麻绳扎紧。管与缸接头的办法是先在缸上钻眼，将管伸入后再用白灰抹好。“检查缸”入水口比出水口要高，以使缸内不存水。为了不使泉水在夜里白白流失，在管尾又砌一个可容一夜流水量的蓄水池。在全村群众积极努力下，引水工程在五月二日完成了，这个工程共用材料费九百万元，人工两千个。洙水村全体人民世世代代渴望解决的用水问题从此解决了。
    当三里外的泉水顺着水管流到村里的那一天，洙水村的农民们像办喜事一样的高兴，大家都争着来看水。有一位七十多岁的老太太指着工作组的同志说：“你们都是毛主席的好干部，这回可把俺村的病治好了。”不少人说：这回我们的毛驴可以用来上地生产了。
