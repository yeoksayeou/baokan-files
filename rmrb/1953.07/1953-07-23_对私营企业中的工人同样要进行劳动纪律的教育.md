    Labor Discipline Education Should Also Be Conducted for Workers in Private Enterprises
    In Wuhan, Tianjin, and other places, the Party and trade unions have conducted labor discipline education for employees in private enterprises, which has improved employees' understanding of the importance of labor discipline and has begun to establish a conscious labor discipline. Absenteeism among workers has been greatly reduced, and the quantity and quality of products have been significantly improved.
    Judging from the experience of various places in conducting labor discipline education for employees of private enterprises, we must pay special attention to solving two ideological problems. The first problem is to break the vague understanding of many employees that the success or failure of private enterprises is the business of the capitalists and has nothing to do with us workers. This is because they do not understand that the success or failure of private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is not only a private matter for the capitalists, but also a major matter related to national construction and the needs of the people. Today, the development of private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is in line with the needs of the country and the interests of the working class. Therefore, the working class, which bears the responsibility of national leadership, while working in private enterprises, must not only supervise the capitalists to implement government policies and laws, but also actively produce and continuously improve labor productivity, and assist the capitalists in improving production management. Sheng Junqing, a worker at the Wuhan Xinsheng Machine Factory, sometimes worked hungry in order to rush the work when the capitalists accepted the task of repairing ships for the country. He said: This is a national ship, the sooner it is repaired, the sooner it can transport goods. When the factory sent him to Xinyang to install a rice milling machine, it was inconvenient to eat and sleep there, and he really didn't want to do it. However, he thought that the installed rice milling machine was for supplying rice to the people. If it was not installed well, it would affect the people's lives. Therefore, regardless of all difficulties, he slept on the straw when there was no place to sleep, and resolutely completed the task after a month and two days. Many of the difficulties he encountered could have been avoided and should have been resolved by the capitalists; it was wrong for the capitalists of the factory not to take good care of these aspects. However, Sheng Junqing was not afraid of these difficulties and worked hard to complete the task, precisely because he understood his responsibility to the country and the people. This is worthy of praise. The second problem is to make the employees of private enterprises realize that improving life and welfare depends on the development of production. If private enterprises are poorly managed, the quality of products is low, and the cost is high, and the factory really loses money, then of course there is no question of improving life according to possibility and necessity. Therefore, employees must also actively find tricks, learn advanced experience, improve labor productivity, and assist the capitalists in improving production management, and use their own practical actions to promote and unite the capitalists to do a good job in production and implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital.
    Just as the employees in private enterprises in various places are consciously strengthening labor discipline, some minority capitalists in Tianjin and other places mistakenly believe that "you rectified us during the Five-Anti Campaign, and now it's time to rectify you." They took the opportunity to unreasonably oppress workers and put forward harsh conditions for workers to accept. For example, some capitalists even formulated factory rules and labor discipline themselves without consulting the trade union, and handed them over to the trade union for implementation. Some capitalists also took the opportunity to retaliate and find excuses to dismiss employees. For example, Jia Qiyu, the capitalist of Tianjin Stationery Factory, wanted to dismiss Xia Huaibin, an employee, because Xia had quarreled with him in front of the manager of another factory, and Jia felt that he had lost face. After the trade union patiently explained to him, he put forward two conditions: First, hold a meeting to ask Xia to review and apologize to him at the meeting, and also find managers from other factories to attend the meeting; Second, Xia must sign the so-called "seven major crimes" written by the capitalist. If he commits one of the "seven major crimes" in the future, he must be willing to be dealt with by the capitalist. From the above facts, we can see that a few capitalists do not understand the overall situation. Therefore, while rectifying labor discipline among workers, the government's industrial and commercial management departments, labor bureaus, and federations of industry and commerce should promptly educate the capitalists, mobilize the capitalists to actively cooperate with the trade union to strengthen labor discipline, and take the initiative to improve production management, labor conditions, and necessary and possible welfare facilities in order to develop production and improve the enthusiasm of employees. At the same time, for the Party and trade unions in private enterprises, we must deal with this issue with a clear head. On the one hand, we must recognize that capitalists who do not understand the overall situation are, after all, a minority. We must not shake our confidence in strengthening labor discipline because of the illegal acts of individual capitalists; we must not be afraid that capitalists will take the opportunity to retaliate and unreasonably oppress us, and we will not dare to continue to educate workers on labor discipline. On the other hand, we must educate and unite workers, expose these illegal acts of a few capitalists in a timely manner, and conduct necessary struggles against illegal acts. We must formulate factory rules and labor discipline through labor-capital consultation.

### 对私营企业中的工人同样要进行劳动纪律的教育

    对私营企业中的工人同样要进行劳动纪律的教育
    武汉、天津各地，党和工会已在私营企业中，对职工进行了劳动纪律的教育，提高了职工对劳动纪律重要性的认识，开始树立起自觉的劳动纪律，工人旷工缺勤的已大大减少，产品的数量和质量有了显著提高。
    从各地对私营企业职工进行劳动纪律的经验来看，我们要特别注意解决两个思想问题。第一个问题是要打破很多职工的一种模糊认识，他们认为私营企业搞好搞坏，反正是资本家的事，和我们工人无关。这是由于他们不懂得有利国计民生的私营企业，搞好搞坏，不光是资方的私事，而且是关系国家建设、人民需要的大事。今天有利国计民生的私营企业的发展，是符合于国家的需要和工人阶级的利益的。所以担负着国家领导责任的工人阶级，在私营企业中做工的，既要监督资方，执行政府的政策法令，同时又要积极生产，不断提高劳动生产率，协助资方改进生产管理。武汉新生机器厂工人盛钧庆，在资方接受了替国家修理轮船任务的时候，为了赶工，他有时饿着肚子干，他说：这是国家的轮船，早修好了早运货；厂里派他到信阳去安装碾米机，在那里，吃饭睡觉都不方便，他真是不愿意干下去。但是，他想到安装的是供应人民吃米用的碾米机，不安装好，就会影响人民生活，所以不顾一切困难，没地方睡，就睡在稻草上，睡了一个月零两天，坚决完成任务。他所遇到的这许多困难有的是可以避免的，是资方应该予以解决的；该厂资方没有很好照顾这些方面是不对的。但是盛钧庆不怕这些困难，努力完成任务，正是由于他明白了自己对国家和人民的责任。这是值得表扬的。第二个问题，是要使私营企业职工认识到，提高生活，改善福利，要靠发展生产。如果私营企业经营不善，产品质量低，成本高，工厂真的赔了钱，当然就谈不到根据可能和必要，去改善生活，所以职工们也要积极找窍门，学习先进经验，提高劳动生产率，协助资方改进生产管理，用自己的实际行动，推动和团结资方搞好生产，贯彻劳资两利的政策。
    正当各地私营企业中职工自觉地加强劳动纪律的时候，天津等地的某些少数资本家，竟错误地认为“五反时你们整我们，现在该整你们了。”乘机向工人进行无理压迫，对工人提出苛刻的条件，要工人接受。比如有的资方，竟不和工会协商，自己拟订一个厂规和劳动纪律，交付工会去执行。也有的资方乘机报复，找藉口解雇职工，比如天津文具厂资方贾其钰，因职员夏怀斌在其他厂经理面前和他闹过口角，贾认为有失脸面，非要将夏解雇不可。经工会向他耐心解释后，他提出两个条件：一、召开大会，要夏在大会上检讨并向他道歉，开会时还要找别厂经理去旁听；二、要夏在资方提出的所谓“七大罪状”书上签字，如以后犯了“七大罪状”之一，须甘愿受资方处理。从上面这些事实中，我们可以看到，有少数资本家是不明大义的。为此在工人中进行整顿劳动纪律的同时，政府的工商业管理部门、劳动局以及工商业联合会，要及时向资方进行教育，动员资方积极配合工会加强劳动纪律的工作，主动改进生产管理、劳动条件以及必要和可能的福利设施，以利于发展生产，提高职工的积极性。同时对于私营企业中的党和工会来说，我们要头脑清醒地对待这个问题。一方面，要认识到不明大义的资方，毕竟是少数，不要因为个别资本家的非法行为，就动摇了加强劳动纪律工作的信心；不要因为害怕资本家乘机进行报复和无理压迫，就不敢再对工人进行劳动纪律的教育了。另一方面，要教育和团结工人，及时揭发少数资本家的这些不法行为，向不法行为进行必要的斗争，要通过劳资协商的方法，来制订厂规和劳动纪律。
