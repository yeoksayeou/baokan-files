The Central People's Government's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the All-China National Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union jointly convened a national promotion meeting on the "Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau Mechanical Section Work Method" in Beijing from June 22nd to July 6th. More than one hundred postal and telecommunications worker representatives from various regions attended the meeting.

The "Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau Mechanical Section Work Method" is an advanced experience in improving the connection rate and work quality of urban automatic telephones. The work quality of urban automatic telephones directly affects the communication links of the broad masses of people; the automatic telephone mechanical department is a key department for improving work quality. In the past, the mechanical departments of automatic telephones did not have a set of scientific working methods, and the quality of work was very poor. All the staff of the Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau's urban telephone mechanical section, closely focusing on improving the connection rate and ensuring the accuracy of automatic switching, correctly grasped the regularity of automatic mechanical maintenance work, and created a set of scientific and brand-new working methods: First, use methods such as adjusting machine parts and reasonably allocating numbers to balance the load of the machines and improve the connection rate; second, start from solving the mechanical obstacles that are most harmful and numerous, and gradually eliminate the phenomenon of inaccurate connection; third, regularly check machine parts, and gradually implement the requirements of standard adjustment according to the actual situation, so that the machines always maintain normal operation and prevent obstacles; fourth, assist users to effectively use automatic telephones; fifth, be good at using statistical test data, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, starting from investigation and research work, discovering key problems, and grasping the basic laws of mechanical maintenance.

The superiority of the "Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau Mechanical Section Work Method" lies in its ability to quickly improve the connection rate of automatic telephones, expand the actual installed capacity of existing equipment, significantly reduce the mechanical failure rate, basically eliminate serious obstacles such as "crosstalk" and "wrong numbers," effectively improve the working quality of urban telephones, extend the service life of machines, and reduce enterprise costs. The Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau's Mechanical Section used this working method to create an advanced record of increasing the automatic telephone connection rate from 50.6% to 80.7%, and expanded the actual installed capacity by 10%; the failure rate of user equipment in the bureau decreased from 7.24% to 0.74%, and the failure rate of mechanical equipment in the bureau decreased from 7.64% to 2.8%. This made the automatic telephones in the area of the Second Branch of Shenyang City noticeably smooth.

At the meeting, the Mechanical Section of the Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau explained and actually demonstrated the working method, and introduced the effectiveness of the Fourth Branch of Shenyang City Mechanical Team in promoting this working method. The representatives from various regions unanimously expressed their determination to learn and promote this advanced experience, so that it would become the common wealth of postal and telecommunications workers across the country. The meeting especially emphasized clarifying the advanced thinking of the staff of the Mechanical Section of the Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau. The representatives attending the meeting universally used the advanced thinking of the staff of the Mechanical Section of the Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau to examine the shortcomings in their own work, so that the representatives attending the meeting improved a step in both political thought and operational technology.

Before the closing of the meeting, an award ceremony was held.

    中央邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会召开“沈阳电信局机械股工作法”推广会议
    中央人民政府邮电部和中国邮电工会全国委员会，于六月二十二日到七月六日在北京联合召开了“沈阳电信局机械股工作法”全国推广会议，到会的有各地邮电职工代表百余人。
    “沈阳电信局机械股工作法”，是提高市内自动电话接通率和工作质量的一项先进经验。市内自动电话的工作质量，直接影响广大人民的通信联系；自动电话机械部门则是提高工作质量的一个关键部门。过去自动电话的机械部门没有一套科学的工作方法，工作质量很差。沈阳电信局市内电话机械股全体职工紧紧围绕着提高接通率和保证自动接续的准确性，正确地掌握了自动机械维护工作的规律性，创造出一套科学的崭新的工作方法：第一、用调剂机件、合理放号等办法使机器的负荷平衡，提高接通率；第二、从解决危害性最大和数量最多的机械障碍着手，逐步消灭接续不准确的现象；第三、定期检查机件，根据实际情况，逐步地贯彻标准调整的要求，使机器经常保持正常动作，做到预防障碍；第四、协助用户有效地使用自动电话；第五、善于运用统计测试资料，集中群众智慧，从调查研究工作入手，发现关键问题，掌握住机械维护的基本规律。
    “沈阳电信局机械股工作法”的优越性在于能迅速提高自动电话的接通率，能扩大现有设备的实装容量，能显著地降低机械障碍率，基本上消灭“串话”“错号”等严重障碍，有效地提高市内电话的工作质量，能延长机器的使用寿命，降低企业成本。沈阳电信局机械股运用这个工作法，创造了自动电话接通率由百分之五十点六提高到百分之八十点七的先进纪录，并扩大了实装容量百分之十；局内用户设备的障碍率由百分之七点二四降为百分之零点七四，局内机械设备的障碍率由百分之七点六四降为百分之二点八。使沈阳市二分局范围内的自动电话明显地畅通起来。
    会上，沈阳电信局机械股作了关于工作法的讲解和实际表演，并介绍了沈阳四分局机械班推广这个工作法的成效。各地代表一致表示要坚决学习和推广这个先进经验，使它成为全国邮电工人所共有的财富，会议特别注重阐明沈阳电信局机械股职工的先进思想。到会代表普遍根据沈阳电信局机械股职工的先进思想，检查自己工作中的缺点，使到会代表在政治思想上和操作技术上都提高了一步。
    会议闭幕前，举行了授奖仪式。
