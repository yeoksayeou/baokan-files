A Major Victory in China's Coal Mine Construction
—Introducing the Construction Work of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine
　　Wang Xi, Liu Zhong, Chen Qi

　　The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine began producing coal on July 1st this year. It is the first large open-pit mine built by New China. The completed open-pit mine project is a rectangular deep valley 3.6 kilometers long from east to west, 1.5 kilometers wide from north to south, and 30 meters deep. Digging this deep valley involved moving 12 million cubic meters of earthwork. This earthwork could be piled into two long dikes one meter square along the more than 10,000-li coastline from Guangzhou Bay in the south to the Yalu River in the north. The equipment used in the open-pit mine, if transported by train at 12 carriages per day, would take half a year to complete. The total length of various cables and wires used is 160 kilometers. The open-pit mine's equipment includes valuable machinery such as electric shovels, dump trucks, track-shifting machines, and mercury rectifiers from the Urals; sleepers from the Boketu Forestry Bureau in Inner Mongolia; rails from Chongqing 101 Factory; and graders from the Northwest Xianyang Petroleum Administration. Both domestic and foreign sources enthusiastically supported the open-pit mine, which ensured the timely completion of the construction task.

　　The Haizhou Open-Pit Mine has thick coal seams close to the surface, making it a very valuable open-pit mine for development. However, during the puppet Manchukuo period, Japanese imperialists recklessly dug eight inclined shafts, using the simplest and most backward methods to plunder the coal seams of the open-pit mine. Due to the use of backward mining methods, the recovery rate was only 30 percent. The vast majority of the remaining coal was left underground. At that time, safety conditions were extremely poor, and roof collapses and sidewall failures swallowed countless workers' lives. Workers described the painful life at that time: "Mining coal is like a piece of meat sandwiched between three stones," "Going out in the morning, you can't be sure you'll come back at night." After liberation, the working class was emancipated, and coal mines became the wealth of the country. In order to rationally utilize the motherland's resources, the Communist Party and the People's Government decided to abandon the old tunnels and develop the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine.

　　In 1951, when the open-pit mine began construction, it was the most tense period of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the state's funds were the most difficult. Developing the open-pit mine required abandoning the original eight pit entrances with a total annual output of one million tons, and also investing a large amount of capital. For the long-term interests of the working class, the Communist Party and the People's Government made the greatest determination and resolutely implemented this decision.

　　During the construction of the open-pit mine, the old tunnels from the puppet Manchukuo period added many difficulties to the construction project, such as the collapse of empty tunnels and the spontaneous combustion of old coal seams. But difficulties could not stop the labor and creativity of the working class. The workers heroically and firmly destroyed the old and backward coal pits of the past on the dilapidated and incomplete empty tunnels, and magically built a brand new open-pit mine with socialist advanced equipment.

　　Today, green trees have been planted along the northern edge of the open-pit mine, which will become a future protective forest. Workers use various machines and work happily in the sun. Huge electric shovels load rocks into electric locomotives, which are driven from the mining area to the dumping site. At the touch of a button, the dump truck will automatically turn over. Mechanization has replaced heavy physical labor, and fatal accidents no longer occur. This not only ensures the safety and health of workers, but also allows all coal seams to be mined, ensuring that the motherland's underground resources are not lost at all.

　　This spring, in order to hand over the open-pit mine for production on the Party's birthday, "July 1st," the open-pit mine workers launched a selfless labor emulation campaign. The amount of work completed in the second quarter (excluding earthwork) was equal to 60 percent of the total amount of work in the past two years. Now the open-pit mine has prepared a half-year's output for production, greatly exceeding the requirements of the preliminary design.

　　The successful construction of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine fully demonstrates the superiority of China's New Democratic economic system.

　　The construction of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine has received a lot of help from the Soviet people and Soviet experts. The design of this open-pit mine was entrusted to Soviet experts. Based on Soviet advanced experience, the design of the Soviet experts made the coal production time of the open-pit mine one and a half years earlier than a previous old design. In this way, it is possible to mine while building, greatly saving the capital required by the state. In addition, in terms of transportation, Soviet experts adopted a wraparound reciprocating wiring method, which increased transportation efficiency by 50 percent compared to the Fushun Coal Mine. In terms of mining, Soviet experts adopted a mixed-section mining method, which can reduce 35 kilometers of line equipment. In terms of power transmission, the centralized power transmission method is adopted, which reduces the equipment capacity by 20 percent compared to the past sub-regional power transmission. The adoption of all these significant advanced technologies has greatly improved the transportation efficiency of the open-pit mine and greatly reduced costs. Its coal mining cost is much lower than that of the Fushun Open-Pit Mine designed by the puppet Manchukuo.

　　The promotion of Soviet advanced technology is not without difficulties here. The construction process of the open-pit mine is a process of struggle between socialist advanced thinking and conservative backward thinking. On every major design and construction issue, individual technicians, based on old design ideas, often used some objectively existing difficulties as an excuse to engage in fierce debates with Soviet experts, the largest of which were the debate on the design of the horse farm, the debate on changing the location of Water Ditch No. 7, and the debate on the relocation of Water Ditch No. 2. In the debate on Water Ditch No. 2, the main senior technicians of Ping'an Mine and the Technical Security Section repeatedly advocated moving the ditch because of the discovery of an empty tunnel at the bottom of Water Ditch No. 2. After a week of debate, the Soviet experts finally proposed a foolproof plan and made a special speech lasting four hours, persuading the technicians and saving the country 3.48 billion yuan in relocation fees. In each debate, the Soviet experts patiently put forward convincing scientific evidence, criticized conservative and backward ideas, educated the vast number of cadres and technicians, and reversed the conservative thinking of most technicians. Now most of the technicians are launching a high tide of learning Soviet advanced technology, and some have begun to learn Russian in order to learn from the Soviet Union better.

　　The construction of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine started from repairing and utilizing old equipment, adding new equipment, and gradually moving towards full mechanization, which requires a large number of skilled technical workers. Two years ago, there were only 14 workers in the entire open-pit mine, and these workers could not even keep watch over the open-pit mine, let alone engage in large-scale construction.

　　In the past two years, due to the rapid development of the open-pit mine, the number of workers has increased sharply. Some of these workers were former coal miners, and some were young peasants who had just come from the countryside to take exams. The vast majority of them had never worked in an open-pit mine, and some had never even heard of an open-pit mine. The famous electric shovel driver Zhu Wei used to be a farmer. When he first came to the mine, he didn't understand anything and was afraid when he saw the machine. At that time, there were more than 1,200 young peasants like Zhu Wei in the entire open-pit mine. It was almost unimaginable in old China to let these people develop such a large-scale open-pit mine. But our Party has great trust in the creative wisdom of the working people, entrusts them with such arduous tasks, and leads them to learn from the Soviet Union, overcome all difficulties, and gradually master the skills of building open-pit mines. Now they are operating electric shovels, driving locomotives, and performing their work skillfully, becoming a vital force in building large open-pit mines. Model electric car driver Song Yongkuan and model bulldozer driver Xia Chuanke both learned while working during the construction, gradually turning from "outsiders" to "insiders."

　　They not only learned how to use machinery, but also created many significant new records. The electric shovel driver Zhu Wei team successively created new records of 5,720 cubic meters and 7,842 cubic meters per shift, and completed the task for the first half of the year 55 days ahead of schedule. Model driver Song Yongkuan has safely operated more than 70,000 kilometers in the past two years, ensuring that the electric shovel has overfulfilled its tasks. In the two years of the open-pit mine's construction, a total of 1,521 rationalization proposals and inventions have been put forward, of which 53 are of significant value. During the construction of the open-pit mine, a large number of excellent technical management cadres have also grown up. Chen Cuiwen, the head of the transportation section, was originally a train driver. In the past two years, he has gradually learned the methods of managing a modern enterprise, grasped the key to safe transportation, and won the Safety Red Flag award three times in a row in March, April, and May of this year. Technical management cadres like him, who have grown up from among the workers, account for 66 percent of the entire open-pit mine.

　　In the past two years, the rapid development of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine has been encouraging. This is just the beginning of the entire construction. In the future, it will produce while building, and move towards a higher direction of mechanization and automation.

    我国煤矿建设上的重大胜利
    ——介绍阜新海州露天矿的建设工作
    王习、刘忠、陈旗
    阜新海州露天矿在今年七月一日开始出煤了。它是新中国建设起来的第一个大的露天矿。现在已经完工的露天矿工程，是一条东西长三点六公里、南北宽一点五公里、深度三十公尺的长方形深谷。开挖这条深谷，运走了一千二百万立方公尺土方。这些土方，可在我国南起广州湾，北抵鸭绿江一万多里长的海岸线上，堆成两条一公尺见方的长堤。露天矿所用的器材设备，若以火车装运，每天十二个车皮，半年时间才可装完。所用的各种电缆电线全长一百六十公里。露天矿的设备器材，有远从乌拉尔运来的电铲、自翻车、移道机、水银整流器等贵重机械；有从内蒙博克图楞场运来的枕木；有重庆一○一厂的铁轨；有西北咸阳石油管理局的平道机。国内国外，到处都热情地支援露天矿，这就保证了建设任务的及时完成。
    海州露天矿的煤层厚，离地面近，是个很有开发价值的露天矿。但在伪满时，日本帝国主义胡乱地挖了八个斜井，采用了最简陋最落后的办法，掠夺式地采掘了露天矿的煤层。由于采用落后的开采方法，回采率只到百分之三十。其余绝大部分的煤都扔在地下。当时安全条件极坏，冒顶片帮吞噬了无数工人的生命。工人们形容那时的痛苦生活说：“刨煤的就是三块石头中间夹着的一块肉”，“早上出去，不敢担保晚上能回来。”解放后，工人阶级翻了身，煤矿变成了国家的财富。共产党和人民政府为了合理地利用祖国资源，决定废弃旧有的坑道，开发海州露天矿。
    一九五一年，露天矿开始建设的时候，正是抗美援朝最紧张、国家资金最艰难的时候。开发露天矿，要废弃原有的八个年产总量一百万吨的坑口，还要投下一大笔资金。共产党和人民政府为了工人阶级的长远利益，下了最大的决心，坚决执行了这个决定。
    在露天矿建设过程中，伪满旧有的巷道，曾给建设工程增加了许多困难。比如空巷陷落、旧煤层发火等。但困难挡不住工人阶级的劳动创造，工人们在残缺破烂的空巷上，英勇坚强地摧毁了过去陈旧落后的煤坑，神奇地建设了一个崭新的、具有社会主义先进设备的露天矿。
    如今，露天矿的北沿，已经栽上了绿色的树木，这是未来的防护林。工人们使用着各种机械，在阳光下愉快地劳动着。巨大的电铲把岩石装在电机车里，由掘场开到排土场，一按电钮，装土车就会自动翻过来。机械化代替了笨重的体力劳动，死亡事故不再发生了。这不仅保证了工人的安全和健康，而且可以把全部煤层都采出来，使祖国地下资源一点不受损失。
    今年春天，露天矿工人们为了在党的生日“七 一”把露天矿移交生产，展开了忘我的劳动竞赛。第二季度完成的工程量（土方除外），等于过去两年工程总量的百分之六十。现在露天矿已为生产准备好半年的产量，大大超过了初步设计的要求。
    海州露天矿建设的成功，充分说明了我国新民主主义经济制度的优越性。
    海州露天矿的建设曾得到苏联人民和苏联专家的很多帮助。这个露天矿的设计是委托苏联专家作的。根据苏联的先进经验，苏联专家的设计使露天矿出煤时间较从前的一项旧的设计提前一年半。这样就可以一边开采，一边建设，大大节省了国家所需要投入的资金。另外，在运输上，苏联专家采用怀抱折返式的配线方法，使运输效率比抚顺煤矿提高百分之五十。在开采上，苏联专家采用混合段采掘方法，可减少三十五公里的线路设备。在送电关系上，采用集中送电方法，较过去分区送电，减少设备容量百分之二十。所有这些重大意义的先进技术的采用，使露天矿的运输效率大大提高，成本大大降低。它的采煤成本远较伪满设计的抚顺露天矿为低。
    苏联先进技术的推广，在这里并不是毫无困难的。露天矿建设的过程，就是社会主义先进思想与保守落后思想的斗争过程。在每一个设计、施工的重大问题上，个别技术人员根据旧的设计思想，时常借口一些客观存在的困难，与苏联专家进行激烈的争论，其中最大的有关于马场设计的争论、改变七号水沟位置的争论以及二号水沟迁移问题的争论等。在二号水沟的争论中，平安矿和技术保安科主要高级技术人员，以二号水沟底部发现空巷为理由，一再主张搬家。争论了一个星期，最后，苏联专家提出万无一失的方案，作了一次长达四小时的专题发言，说服了技术人员，为国家节省迁移费三十四亿八千万元。在每次争论中，苏联专家都很耐心地提出令人信服的科学根据，批判了保守落后的思想，教育了广大干部及技术人员，扭转了大部分技术人员的保守思想。现在大部技术人员，正展开学习苏联先进技术的高潮，有些人并开始学俄文，以便更好地向苏联学习。
    海州露天矿的建设，是从修复、利用旧有设备、增添新式设备、逐步走向全部机械化的，这就需要大批熟练的技术工人。两年以前，全露天矿只有十四个工人，这些工人看守露天矿都看不过来，更不用说从事大规模的建设了。
    两年多的时间里，由于露天矿的迅速发展，工作人数激增。这些工人有的是过去的刨煤工，有的是新从农村投考来的青年农民，他们当中绝大部分没有开过露天矿，有的甚至连听说都没听说过露天矿。著名的电铲司机朱伟，过去就是个农民。他初到矿山，什么也不懂，一看见机器就害怕。当时像朱伟这样的青年农民，全露天矿就有一千二百多名。让这些人来开发这样一个规模宏大的露天矿，在旧中国几乎是不可想像的事情。但是我们党却非常信赖劳动人民的创造智慧，把这样繁重的任务交给他们，并领导他们向苏联学习，战胜了一切困难，逐步掌握了建设露天矿的本领。现在他们开动着电铲，驾驶着机车，熟练地进行着自己的工作，变成了建设大露天矿的生力军。模范电车司机宋永宽，模范推土机司机夏传科，都是在建设中一边工作，一边学习，从“外行”逐步变成“内行”的。
    他们不但学会使用机械，而且还创造了许多重大的新纪录。电铲司机朱伟小组，接连创造了每班五千七百二十立方公尺、七千八百四十二立方公尺的新纪录，并提前五十五天完成上半年的任务。模范司机宋永宽，两年来安全运行七万多公里，保证电铲超额完成了任务。在两年来的露天矿的建设中，共提出合理化建议及发明创造一千五百二十一件，其中有重大价值的占五十三件。在露天矿的建设中，还成长起来大批优秀的技术管理干部。运输科长陈萃文，原来是火车司机，两年当中，他逐步学会了管理现代化企业的方法，抓住安全运输的关键，使得全科在今年三、四、五月份中，连得三次安全红旗奖励。像他这样从工人中成长起来的技术管理干部，在全露天矿要占百分之六十六。
    两年以来，海州露天矿的飞速发展是令人欢欣鼓舞的。这不过是全部建设的一个开端，今后它将一边生产，一边建设，朝着机械化、自动化更高的方向迈进。
