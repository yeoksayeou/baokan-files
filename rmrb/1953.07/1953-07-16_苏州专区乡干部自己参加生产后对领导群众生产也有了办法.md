Xinhua News Agency:

    Township cadres in various counties of Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are now leading the masses in production by participating in production themselves, which is very popular among farmers.

    In the nine counties of Suzhou Prefecture, including Wuxi and Yixing, township cadres in the past had very little time to participate in production, and therefore could not effectively lead the masses in production. Now, the working style of township cadres has improved significantly. The vast majority of semi-detached township cadres in the entire area spend most of their time participating in production within mutual aid teams. In Yixing County, township cadres who periodically return home to participate in production and are semi-detached from production account for 88.98 percent of the total number of township cadres. In Wuxi County, more than 83 percent of the semi-detached township cadres periodically return home to participate in production. After participating in production, township cadres have also developed better methods for leading production. They use the villages where they are located as a base, divide the work into sections, lead production, and periodically return to the township people's government to meet, exchange information and experience, and promptly solve problems encountered in their work. They set an example themselves, cultivate typical cases, and quickly promote them from point to area. In the Shazhou District of Changshu County, the masses were afraid that watering crops to combat drought would damage the wheat and cause the soil to become compacted. The township head of Hexing Township and the director of the Farmers' Association of Donglai Township took the lead in mobilizing water pumping within their own mutual aid teams. After several days of watering, all the cotton seedlings emerged, and the wheat also grew very well. As a result, 80 percent of the cotton fields in the entire village followed suit and were watered. After Pan Yude, the deputy township head of Jinquan Township in Yixing County, returned home to participate in production, he carefully selected a mu of land when promoting appropriate close planting of rice to ensure that the spacing between rows and plants was uniform. The masses praised his method and began to learn from him. He Liangxian, the finance and grain officer of the township, was the first to use salt water to select seeds, which also motivated many farmers to adopt this method.

    苏州专区乡干部自己参加生产后对领导群众生产也有了办法
    江苏省苏州专区各县的乡干部从自己参加生产来领导群众生产，很受农民欢迎。
    苏州专区所属无锡、宜兴等九个县的乡干部，过去由于自己参加生产的时间很少，因此也就不能很好地领导群众生产。现在，乡干部的工作作风有了显著的改进，全区绝大多数半脱离生产的乡干部，大部分时间在互助组内参加生产。宜兴县定期回家生产、半脱离生产的乡干部，占乡干部总数百分之八十八点九八。无锡县有百分之八十三以上半脱离生产的乡干部，定期回家参加生产。乡干部参加生产后，对领导生产也有了办法。他们以自己所在的村为基础，划片分工，领导生产，定期回到乡人民政府碰头，交流情况和经验，及时解决工作中遇到的问题。他们自己做出榜样，培养典型，很快地由点推广到面。常熟县沙洲区群众怕车水抗旱会损坏麦子，使泥土板结，该区合兴乡乡长和东莱乡农会主任便在自己互助组内发动车水。车水几天后，棉苗全部出土，麦子也长得很好。这样，全村百分之八十的棉田都跟着车了水。宜兴县金泉乡副乡长潘禹德回家参加生产，在推广水稻适当密植时，自己选择一亩田做到行和株的距离均匀。群众看了都说他的办法好，并跟着他学起来。该乡财粮员何良仙首先用盐水选种，也带动很多农民群众实行这一办法。（新华社）
