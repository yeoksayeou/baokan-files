    How Should the Party's Grassroots Organizations in Rural Areas Lead Production
    Chen Junsheng, Secretary of the CPC Keshan County Committee

    How the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas should lead agricultural production is an old question, and also a question that has not been resolved for a long time. In the past, we did a lot of work, but we didn't pay attention to summarizing experiences, so the work was always disorganized and without a clear direction. Therefore, now we should go deeper, help village cadres summarize existing work experience, and systemize many good leadership methods to suit their level, turning the accidental into the conscious. Then, we should continue to improve and enhance it in further practice. In order to achieve this goal, the Keshan County Committee carried out this work in the sowing of autumn crops.

    Although the Party Central Committee has pointed out that production is the regular central task of rural areas, it currently remains only at the meeting and verbal levels in the democratic villages. Some people think: "When the central instructions come, production is the center; once the spring plowing is over, production is no longer the center." Some people only know from the words of the central instruction that spring plowing and production is the "central task that overwhelms everything in rural areas," but in reality, they have not done it that way. They also do not have good methods for how to do a good job in the central task of rural areas. This makes everyone feel that "it is easy to say, but difficult to do, and I don't know where to start."

    According to the instructions of the CPC Northeast Bureau, to do a good job in agricultural production, it is necessary to proceed simultaneously from three aspects: ideological education, mutual aid and cooperation, and technical reform. However, the leadership of agricultural production in Democratic Village, Keshan County, often focuses on one aspect while neglecting others. Judging from the work of preparing for plowing and spring plowing, they grasped the promotion of the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience tightly, but relaxed mutual aid and cooperation, and ideological education. The mutual benefit issues of the nine permanent mutual aid groups have not been well resolved, and no one is managing the two elementary mutual aid groups. In terms of ideological education for farmers, after policy re-education and the Marriage Law Movement Month, they felt that "there is nothing to do"; they are not clear about what kind of political and ideological education farmers should regularly receive, and through what forms and using what methods. The county and district also provided poor guidance in this regard. The propaganda network also failed to play its due role. In the past, mutual aid and cooperation, technical promotion, and ideological education were not well integrated, in addition to unclear understanding of the significance of the combination of these three aspects in ideology, there were also problems in methods. Village cadres did not distinguish between work steps and could not specifically arrange their work, so they had to "push forward" the work regardless of its importance and urgency. Therefore, they often grasped one aspect and lost another; or grasped the secondary and lost the primary.

    At the spring plowing and sowing conference held by the 14th District Committee, the village cadres had very different opinions on the work steps. Some advocated "going back to hold a Party member meeting first to get through the ideas," some advocated "dividing the work at the cadre meeting first," and some advocated "holding a group leader meeting first, which will be implemented quickly"; while the cadres of Democratic Village at that time advocated "not holding any other meetings, just holding a propaganda network meeting." This shows that the working methods of village cadres are fragmented, piecemeal, and don’t consider the whole situation; they only propose how to start, and no one proposes what to do during the work process and what to do at the end. They thought that passing on the spirit of the district committee's instructions would be "all is well." This is an important reason for the "tight at the beginning and loose at the end" of the work in the past.

    In order to improve the village-level organization's leadership in production, the 14th District Committee studied the methods of leading production in various villages in the past, and combined them, and proposed to carry out work in five steps. The Democratic Village branch followed the instructions of the District Committee and tried this method:

    The first step is to study instructions, analyze the situation, put forward requirements, and organize forces. After the village branch secretary returned to the village, he convened a branch committee meeting that evening to convey and discuss the instructions of the district committee; then he studied the specific situation of the village: two groups did not use improved agricultural implements; five mutual aid groups and three cooperatives did not disinfect seeds; everyone had not paid attention to drought resistance and seedling protection, and was not accustomed to broad sowing of wheat; the members of the mutual aid groups did not score work points, and the scoring was not implemented. According to the spirit of the district committee's instructions, combined with the specific situation of the village, specific measures were formulated to solve the existing problems in the three aspects of mutual assistance, technology, and ideology; and it was decided that each branch committee member should specifically lead the work of one village, and no matter what work they did, the branch committee members should take the lead in setting an example first.

    After this period of work, we realized that: (1) How the branch secretary understands the spirit of the district committee's instructions is the key to holding a good branch committee meeting. And whether the branch committee meeting is held well or not is the key to determining the overall work. Therefore, when the district committee assigns work to the branch secretary, it should specifically help the branch secretary understand why to do this and how to do it. (2) It is best to hold an expanded branch committee meeting, absorbing the responsible cadres of Party members of mass organizations to participate, so as to simultaneously study at the meeting how various organizations can cooperate with the central work. (3) The study of instructions and the situation must have a focus, grasp the center. (4) The work of the village must be based on a clear understanding of the situation and within its capabilities, to prevent the tendency of planning too high or too low.

    The second step is to mobilize ideology, explain the tasks clearly, explain the policies, and set an example. In order to turn the spirit of the branch committee meeting into the actions of the masses, the next day at noon, two villages convened meetings of cadres above the group leader level, and four villages convened meetings of cadres and the masses together to discuss improving field operations and other issues. At the same time, propaganda members were arranged to carry out in-depth and specific publicity work.

    The third step is to go deep into each group and cooperative, discover and solve practical problems, help formulate plans, and launch production increase competitions. When checking the sowing work, it was found that there were many shortcomings in the field operations of each group and cooperative. For example, in the Yang Xianting Production Cooperative, many shortcomings were found, and they were helped to find ways to improve. Then, they helped the four production cooperatives and ten mutual aid groups in the whole village to formulate short-term operation plans and rotation plans.

    On the basis of the above, a meeting of mutual aid group leaders and cooperative directors was held to launch a patriotic production increase competition between groups and cooperatives in the whole village, with the operation plans of each group as the competition conditions. Everyone's enthusiasm for competition was very high.

    The experience in this step of work is that the short-term operation plan of the mutual aid group should be practical and feasible, and the main content should include the requirements for the quality and specifications of the operation, the rational use of labor, and the provisions for the rotation order.

    The fourth step is to conduct a comprehensive inspection, discover typical examples, exchange experiences, and promote the movement. On the fourth day after the competition was launched, the inspection and evaluation committee went deep into the fields to conduct inspections. In addition to checking out the shortcomings in the work, they also went deep into the mutual aid groups and production cooperatives to solve some specific problems. Two production cooperatives did not divide the teams well, and the responsibilities were not clear; three production cooperatives did not do a good job of contracting work. After inspection, preliminary solutions were obtained. During the inspection, it was found that a certain group or cooperative had done a good job in a certain project, and their experience was promptly disseminated.

    The experience in this work is: This step of work takes a longer time. In the inspection, close attention should be paid to changes in the situation, and it should be comprehensive; a system of main cadres on duty should be established to avoid no one being responsible for the overall work after the cadres have gone to various villages, groups, and cooperatives, and experiences cannot be exchanged.

    The fifth step is to summarize the evaluation, reward the models, and put forward the key points of the next step of work. The sowing work of the whole village was basically completed by May 17; the branch held a meeting in a timely manner to summarize the field sowing of the whole village, pointed out the achievements of the work, and also put forward shortcomings and remedial measures. Then, a village-wide evaluation meeting was held. As a result of the evaluation, two production cooperatives, three mutual aid groups, and two women's groups were rewarded. Everyone was in high spirits. The branch secretary put forward at the meeting that the next step of work is mainly to hoe wheat, accumulate fertilizer and deliver fertilizer, mobilize women, etc., and called on everyone to do these works better.

    Doing this is to synthesize and systematize the practical work experience of rural grassroots leadership in the past few years; therefore, it is suitable for the general level of current village-level leadership. From the trial implementation, it has been seen that it has the following advantages: (1) It can overcome the phenomenon of "tight at the top and loose at the bottom" and "tight at the beginning and loose at the end." (2) Each organizational system can be unified under a central work in each stage, and carry out work with consistent thinking and consistent steps, which can overcome the phenomena of "each doing its own thing," "unclear center," "separation of Party and government," and "organizations not playing a role." (3) It can avoid the style of simplification and coercion and commandism, and replace it with the working style of the mass line. (4) It can strengthen the planning and initiative of the work, greatly reduce the phenomenon of busy and passive, and can allow village cadres to have a certain amount of time to participate in production. The facts of Democratic Village prove that village cadres can completely participate in production and lead production at the same time. However, the following issues should also be noted: (1) When implementing, it should be noted that there is an internal connection between each section and step; therefore, the division of sections and steps has a certain degree of flexibility and cannot be mechanically implemented. (2) Each step should not stipulate a fixed form, time, or meeting, but should make different regulations according to different situations and purposes. (3) This is only a preliminary experience; in the future, with the progress of work and the improvement of cadre level, it should be gradually enriched and improved.

    党在农村的基层组织应当怎样领导生产
    中共克山县委书记  陈俊生
    党在农村的基层组织如何领导农业生产是个老问题，也是一个长期没有得到解决的问题。过去我们做了不少工作，就是没有注意总结经验，所以工作总是杂七杂八的茫无头绪。因此现在就应该深入下去，帮助村干部总结已有的工作经验，把许多好的领导方法条理化，适合他们的水平，由偶然的变成自觉的。然后在进一步实践中不断改进和提高。为了达到这个目的，克山县委在大秋作物播种工作中，就进行了这一工作。
    虽然党中央已指出，生产是农村的经常的中心工作；但是从民主村来看，目前还只是停留在会议上和口头上。有的人认为：“中央的指示来了，生产是中心；春耕一过，生产就不是中心了。”有的人只是从中央指示的字句上知道了春耕生产是“农村中压倒一切的中心工作”，实际上并没有这样去作。对于如何搞好农村的中心工作，也没有好的方法。这就使大家感到“说起来容易，做起来难，不知从何处着手。”
    按照中共中央东北局的指示，要搞好农业生产，必须从思想教育、互助合作、技术改革三方面同时进行。但是克山县民主村领导农业生产，却是抓住这面而漏掉那面。从备耕和春耕工作来看，他们对肇源丰产经验的推广抓得较紧，而对互助合作、思想教育就放松了。九个常年互助组的互利问题都没有很好地解决，两个初级互助组没有人管。在对农民进行思想教育方面，经过政策补课、贯彻婚姻法运动月后，就感到“没有事了”；对农民经常要进行那些政治思想教育，以及通过什么形式、运用什么方法，都不大清楚。县、区在这方面指导的也差。宣传网也没有起应有的作用。过去没有把互助合作、技术推广、思想教育结合好，除了思想上对这三方面结合的意义认识不清以外，在方法上也有问题。村干部没有分清工作步骤，不能具体安排自己的工作，就只好把工作不分轻重缓急地“往前推”。因此，往往抓住了这一方面就丢掉了那一方面；或者抓住了次要的，丢掉了主要的。
    在十四区区委召开的春耕播种会议上，各村干部对于工作步骤意见颇不一致。有的主张“回去先开党员会打通思想”，有的主张“先在干部会上分好工”，有的主张“先开组长会，贯彻的快”；而民主村的干部当时主张“别的会都不开，光开个宣传网会就行啦”。这说明了村干部工作方法是零碎的、枝枝节节的，而且顾头不顾尾，只提出一开头怎么办，没有一个人提出工作过程中还要做哪些事，结尾做什么。他们以为把区委会的指示精神传达下去就“万事大吉”了。这正是过去工作“前紧后松”的重要原因。
    为了改进村级组织对生产的领导，十四区区委研究了各村过去领导生产的方法，加以综合，提出要分五个步骤进行工作。民主村支部是按照区委的指示试行了这个方法：
    第一步，研究指示，分析情况，提出要求，组织力量。村支部书记回村以后，当晚召开了支部委员会议，传达、讨论了区委会的指示；接着研究了本村的具体情况：有两个组没有使用改良农具；有五个互助组、三个合作社种籽没有消毒；大家还没有注意抗旱保苗工作，也不习惯宽播小麦；互助组里的人马不评分，评分也不实行。根据区委指示的精神，结合本村具体情况，计划要在四月十五日结束大秋作物播种，拟定了解决互助、技术、思想三方面存在的问题的具体办法；并决定每个支部委员具体领导一个屯的工作，不论做什么工作，支委都要带头先作出样子来。
    经过这段工作后，我们体会到：（一）支部书记对区委指示的精神领会得怎样，是开好支部委员会议的关键。而支部委员会议开的好坏，又是决定全盘工作的关键。因此，区委给支部书记布置工作时，要具体帮助支部书记领会为什么要这样做，怎样来做。（二）最好召开支委扩大会议，吸收群众团体的党员负责干部参加，以便同时在会上研究各种组织如何配合中心工作。（三）研究指示、情况都必须有重点，抓住中心。（四）对本村工作必须看准情况、量力而行，防止计划过高或过低的偏向。
    第二步，思想发动，讲清任务，说明政策，做出样子。为了把支部委员会议精神变成群众的行动，第二天午间有两个屯召开了组长以上干部会议，有四个屯连干部带群众都召集在一起开会讨论改进田间作业等问题。同时布置宣传员进行深入具体的宣传工作。
    第三步，深入各个组、社，发现和解决实际问题，帮助制订计划，发动增产竞赛。在检查播种工作时，发现各组、社田间作业有不少缺点，如在杨显亭生产合作社就找出了不少缺点，并帮助他们找出了改进的办法。接着，就帮助全村四个生产合作社、十个互助组订了短期作业计划和轮作计划。
    在上述基础上，召开了互助组长、合作社主任会议，发动起全村组与组、社与社之间的爱国增产竞赛，以各组作业计划为竞赛条件。大家竞赛热情很高。
    在这一步工作中的体会是：互助组的短期作业计划要切实可行，主要内容应该包括作业质量规格的要求，劳动力的合理使用和轮作次序的规定。
    第四步，全面检查，发现典型，交流经验，推动运动。在竞赛发动起来后的第四天，检查评比委员会便深入到田间进行检查。除检查出工作中的缺点外，还深入互助组与生产合作社解决了一些具体问题。有两个生产合作社没有分好队，责任不分明；有三个生产合作社包工没搞好。经检查后都得到了初步解决。在检查中发现某一组、社某一项工作做得较好，就把他们的经验及时加以传播。
    在这一工作中的体会是：这一步的工作时间长些。在检查中要密切注意情况的变化，并要全面；要建立主要干部值班制，以免干部都到各屯、各组、社去以后无人负责全面工作，经验不能交流。
    第五步，总结评比，奖励模范，提出下步工作要点。全村播种工作到五月十七日已基本结束；支部及时开会，对全村大田播种进行了总结，指出了工作成绩，也提出了缺点和补救的办法。然后又召开了全村评比大会。评比结果，有两个生产合作社、三个互助组、两个妇女组获得了奖励。大家情绪很高。支部书记在会上提出了下一步工作主要是铲小麦、积肥送肥、发动妇女等，号召大家把这些工作做得更好。
    这样做是把几年来农村基层领导的实际工作经验加以综合和系统化；因此是适合目前村级领导一般水平的。从试行中已看到它有以下的好处：（一）可克服“上紧下松”“前紧后松”的现象。（二）各个组织系统在各个阶段都能统一在一个中心工作下，思想一致、步骤一致地进行工作，可克服“各搞一套”“中心不明”“党政不分”和“有组织不起作用”的现象。（三）可避免简单化和强迫命令的作风，而代之以群众路线的工作作风。（四）可加强工作的计划性和主动性大大减少忙乱被动现象，可使村干部有一定的时间参加生产。民主村的事实证明了村干部是完全可以既参加生产又领导生产的。但也应注意以下几个问题：（一）在实行时，要注意各个段落间、步骤间是有其内在联系的，因此段落、步骤的划分是有一定灵活性的，不能机械执行。（二）每一步骤都不应规定固定的形式、时间、会议，而应按不同的情况和目的作不同的规定。（三）这还只是初步的经验；今后随着工作的进展，干部水平的提高，还应逐渐加以充实与改进。
