Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: The struggle of the people of Uchinarada Village, Ishikawa Prefecture, supported by people across Japan, against the U.S. military's establishment of a firing range, continues in various ways even after the U.S. military began compulsory firing exercises in Uchinarada Village on June 15.

On June 23, the village government, village council, and the Committee Against Accepting Uchinarada Village jointly held a meeting and reaffirmed their opposition to the Yoshida government's acceptance of Uchinarada Village as a firing range for the U.S. military. They also selected 28 representatives, including Village Chief Nakayama, who departed for Tokyo on the 25th to petition the Diet and stage a sit-in at the Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, a delegation of 21 people from Ishikawa Prefecture also conducted activities against the requisition of Uchinarada Village as a training ground. They held a sit-in demonstration in front of the Diet in Tokyo. The Associated Press said, "Similar groups will take turns conducting such demonstrations."

The Yoshida government not only did not accept the demands of the people but instead used violence to suppress the people's resistance, arresting six members of the Committee Against Accepting Uchinarada Village. On June 29, when about 300 people from Ishikawa Prefecture went to the Ishikawa Prefectural Government to demand their release, the Yoshida government dispatched 300 armed police to suppress them by force. The police suppression aroused even greater righteous indignation among the people, and therefore a conflict broke out between the two sides.

    反对美军强制在内滩村设立打靶场
    日本石川县人民用各种方式坚持斗争
    【新华社一日讯】东京消息：日本全国人民所支持的石川县内滩村人民反对美军设立打靶场的斗争，在六月十五日美军开始强制在内滩村实行打靶演习后，仍在以不同的方式坚持进行。
    六月二十三日，内滩村的村政府、村议会和反对接收内滩村委员会举行了联席会议，再度确定了反对吉田政府接收内滩村为美军打靶场的态度，并选出村长中山等二十八个代表于二十五日动身到东京向国会请愿和到吉田政府外务省进行静坐斗争。同时，由二十一人组成的石川县代表团也进行了反对征用内滩村为演习场的活动。他们在东京国会前举行静坐示威。合众社说：“类似的团体将轮流进行这样的示威”。
    吉田政府不仅不接受人民的要求，相反地还用暴力镇压人民的反抗，逮捕了反对接收内滩村委员会的六位委员。六月二十九日，当石川县人民群众约三百人到石川县政府要求释放他们时，吉田政府竟出动了三百名武装警察以武力相镇压。警察的镇压激起了人民更大的义愤，因此双方发生了冲突。
