    Communist Party Member Wang Hongchang and His Drilling Team
    By our reporter Pei Lan
    In the office of the Party branch of the drilling team of the Twenty-First Engineering Company, there is a dazzling silver shield. This silver shield was awarded to the Wang Hongchang drilling team, the first-class model drilling team in Northeast China.
    In the latter half of 1951, the drilling efficiency of Wang Hongchang's team increased from 2.7 meters per day to 6 meters, and in 1952 it increased to 10.2 meters, with a maximum of 14.85 meters. The advanced drilling method of Wang Hongchang's team was promoted throughout the team, enabling the project, originally planned to be completed in four years, to be completed in two and a half years, which is an immeasurable contribution to the country.
    Before liberation, Wang Hongchang had worked in drilling for four years. At that time, there were no quotas at all, and the amount drilled was what you got paid for. For a long time after liberation, the drilling efficiency was still very low. In 1951, the administration of the drilling team of the Twenty-First Engineering Company proposed a preliminary quota: requiring 2.7 meters to be drilled in 24 hours (three shifts). However, before July 1951, no team had reached this standard.
    In 1951, Comrade Gao Gang issued a call to all industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China to increase production and save 5 million tons of grain. Wang Hongchang's internal activities became even more intense. He joined the Party in 1952, but at that time, his class consciousness had already made him consider: if the Ma Hengchang team can create wealth for the country, shouldn't I contribute to the motherland? He was wholeheartedly seeking a method for fast drilling to improve production efficiency. He went to technician Yang Aifei to ask if fast operation could be used in drilling work. Yang Aifei explained the principle of fast operation and the scientific knowledge of prolonging the life of the machine to him in detail, and encouraged him to try it first. The Party and administration of the drilling team supported his experiment. However, the machines currently in use are already old, what if there is an accident? Initially, he tried using the fast operation method during his night shift. Eight hours passed, and the old machine did not malfunction. In this way, he continued to try for five or six days, not only did it not cause any accidents, but the team's production record broke through 2.7 meters. At this time, he convened a meeting of all workers in the team to introduce his experience with fast operation, hoping that the two operators would also follow suit. Unexpectedly, no one dared to do so. They said, "You have good skills, we don't, let's just work honestly!" Wang Hongchang was an impatient person, and when he heard these words, he wanted to criticize them. However, he remembered what the Party leader said during the Party class: the promotion of advanced experience cannot be rushed. He suppressed his excited emotions and began to carry out arduous mass work. At the team meetings, he repeatedly explained the benefits of fast operation to the team members, and used many concrete facts to illustrate it, in order to inspire the workers to accept this advanced experience. He first persuaded operator Song Zhen (a member of the Communist Youth League). Soon, operator Liu Changgui also began to learn. Later, the three shifts successfully used fast operation, and the team's production efficiency reached 3.5 meters.
        The news that Wang Hongchang's team used advanced experience to create a new record quickly spread throughout the team. The Party branch and administration of the drilling team immediately held a meeting to commend Wang Hongchang and called on everyone to learn from him. The blackboard newspaper published the deeds of Wang Hongchang's team. However, this matter caused different reactions among the masses. Some workers said: Wang Hongchang has found the knack, we must learn from him. Some old technicians said: I have been doing this for more than ten years, and I have never seen this method. Young people are not steady, watch, sooner or later there will be an accident and they will stop doing it...
        Wang Hongchang had not been a team leader for a long time, and his leadership experience was very
    little, how to lead everyone? He thought about it again and again, and asked for several
    The opinions of several team leaders, and finally came up with a production competition. Under the support and help of the Party and administration of the drilling team
    Under the support and help of the Party and administration of the drilling team, the Wang Hongchang team sent a production competition challenge to all teams in the team, the conditions of the challenge were: 1.
    Guarantee a drilling depth of four meters per day; 2. Guarantee that the quality meets the standards;
    Third, ensure an attendance rate of 100%; Fourth, the whole team must be united and do a good job in production. The challenge was posted, but no team accepted the challenge. Some people said: "This is simply nonsense, don't you see what kind of machines we are using!" Some people even said: "This is simply smashing the pot, not letting us eat!" Wang Hongchang found that the distance between the masses' thinking and the use of fast operation was still very large, and challenges could not eliminate this distance. So he moved to the construction site rest room, and during his spare time, he played cards and chatted with the workers, telling them the benefits of fast operation and listening to the opinions of the masses. He found that the vast majority of workers did not dare to use the fast operation method, mainly because two major concerns had not been resolved. One was fear that the machines were old and would cause accidents. In response to this, Wang Hongchang told everyone the principles explained by technician Yang Aifei, and introduced the actual operation results of his own team. The second was that a small number of old technicians were afraid that if production efficiency increased, they would have no work to do once the organization was streamlined. In response to this, Wang Hongchang explained to them the broad prospects of drilling work in the country's economic construction. The workers felt that it made sense, and later, whenever they encountered any difficulties, they asked Wang Hongchang for help. Soon, Wang Hongchang's advanced fast operation method was widely promoted throughout the team, and the production efficiency of each team reached four to five meters. On National Day, October 1, 1951, the Wang Hongchang team and the Zhang Jingli team created a new record of six meters per day, becoming model teams in the team.
    Wang Hongchang was not satisfied with his work achievements. When he was considering how to further improve production efficiency, Soviet experts came to the Twenty-First Engineering Company. The experts introduced them to a series of advanced experiences such as the one-time sand feeding method, the use of cone powder tubes, and the improvement of core sampling methods. Wang Hongchang immediately led the team to conduct on-site experiments. The facts proved that the one-time sand feeding method was completely scientific, but because the tools were not suitable - the drill pipe was not conducive to water discharge, there was a risk of stuck drilling accidents. Based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, combined with his own practical work experience, Wang Hongchang improved the tools and operating methods, extending the drilling time to more than three hours, and each machine could drill 10.2 meters per day. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union was quickly promoted throughout the team.
    With the improvement of work efficiency, the workers' enthusiasm for pursuing quantity was very high. In order to prevent the tendency of neglecting engineering quality, Wang Hongchang raised the issue of establishing a responsibility system in the team: according to the team's situation, it was decided to first establish a reasonable shift handover system, emphasizing the need to check machines and organize tools during the shift handover; at the same time, a team meeting system was established, with a technical research meeting held once a week to unite technical personnel to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; a review meeting was held once a week to review the work of the week and conduct criticism and self-criticism. While establishing the responsibility system, he found that each shift started drilling half an hour before the shift handover, and the receiving shift could not officially start production until half an hour later, wasting more than an hour per shift. He proposed the suggestion of not starting drilling during shift handover, reducing non-production time and further improving work efficiency. In 1952, under the leadership of the trade union of the drilling team, a hero commando competition was launched, and the average production efficiency of the team reached more than ten meters, with some teams reaching twelve meters, and the Wang Hongchang team reaching 14.85 meters. The whole team completed the annual task 33 days ahead of schedule, and model teams such as Wang Hongchang, Zhang Jingli, Diao Qishan, Zhang Shaolin, and Sui Bingrong emerged.
    In 1949, the drilling team was a drilling and grouting team with only more than 30 people. By 1951, it had developed into a drilling team with more than 600 people. The workers came from all directions and their skills were very poor. It was necessary to train a group of skilled workers in a short period of time. Wang Hongchang actively responded to the call of the Party and the administration and formulated a plan for training apprentices. From 1951 to the present, he has trained 23 apprentices, all of whom have become very outstanding operators. When talking about the issue of teaching apprentices, Wang Hongchang said: In the old society, apprentices were not treated as human beings. When I was an apprentice, I suffered countless hardships but could not learn any skills. Now that I am a master, I cannot treat apprentices that way. He said: Workers are different from students who study in the classroom. It is not enough to simply tell apprentices the principles. They must be boldly allowed to actually operate and explain in detail during the operation. Young people are smart and willing to work hard, and they can quickly master the machine. Wang Hongchang not only worked hard to help the apprentices in his own team, but also patiently helped the workers in other teams. Qiu Jichun, a 21-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, came to the drilling team from the countryside. Because the workers in the team were not united, production efficiency improved very slowly. Wang Hongchang not only helped Qiu Jichun improve his operating methods, but also helped them solve the problem of unity within the team, so that the team's production efficiency rapidly caught up with the advanced teams.
    In summary: Playing the core role of Communist Party members in creating and promoting advanced experience is the reason why Wang Hongchang's leading team won the first-class model team.

    共产党员王洪昌和他的钻孔小组
    本报记者　培蓝
    二十一工程公司钻孔队党支部办公室里，放着一个耀眼夺目的银盾。这个银盾是奖给东北区一等模范钻孔组——王洪昌钻孔组的。
    一九五一年后半年，王洪昌小组的钻孔效率由每天二公尺七提高到六公尺，一九五二年又提高到十点二公尺，最高达到十四点八五公尺。王洪昌小组的先进钻孔方法在全队推广以后，使原计划四年完成的工程任务，提前于二年半完成，这对国家的贡献是不可估量的。
    解放以前，王洪昌曾经作了四年钻孔工作。那时候，工作根本没有什么定额，钻多少算多少。解放以后的很长时期内，钻孔效率还是很低。一九五一年，二十一工程公司钻孔队行政上提出个初步定额：要求二十四小时（三班）钻二公尺七。但是在一九五一年七月以前，没有一个组达到这个标准。
    一九五一年高岗同志向全东北工矿企业提出了增产节约五百万吨粮食的号召，王洪昌的内心活动更加厉害了。他是一九五二年入党的，但在当时，他的阶级觉悟已经使他盘算着：马恒昌小组能为国家创造财富，我就不能为祖国贡献一份力量？他一心寻求快速钻孔的方法，提高生产效率。他找到技术员杨爱飞，探问钻孔工作能不能用快速运转；杨爱飞把快速运转的原理，和延长机器寿命的科学常识，详细说给他听，并鼓励他先试试看。钻孔队的党和行政都支持他的试验。但是，现在用的机器已经老掉牙了，万一出了事故怎么办呢？开始，他在值夜班的时候，试着采用快速运转法。八小时过去了，老机器并没有出毛病。这样，他又连续试了五六天，不但完全没有出事故，而且小组生产纪录突破了二公尺七。这时候，他便召集全组工友开会，介绍他用快速运转的经验，希望两个运转手也跟着作。不料谁都不敢这样作。他们说：“你技术好，咱不成，还是老老实实地干吧！”王洪昌是个心急口快的人，听了这些话，很想批评他们两句。但是，他想起了上党课时党的负责同志说的话：推广先进经验不能犯急性病。他压抑着自己激动的感情，开始进行艰苦的群众工作。在小组会上，他三番五次地给组员解释快速运转法的好处，并用许多具体的事实加以说明，以启发工友接受这个先进经验。他首先说服了运转手宋珍（青年团员）。不久，运转手刘昌贵也跟着学起来了。后来，三班试用快速运转成功了，全组生产效率达到三公尺五。
        王洪昌小组运用先进经验创造新纪录的消息，很快传遍了全队。钻孔队党支部和行政方面立即召开会议，表扬了王洪昌，号召大家向他学习。黑板报上登出了王洪昌小组的事迹。但是，这件事情在群众中引起了不同的反映。有些工友说：王洪昌找到了窍门，咱们得好好学习。有些老技术工人说：我干了十多年，也没有见过这个办法，年青人办事不稳当，瞧着吧，早晚出了事故就不干啦……。
        王洪昌担任小组长的时间并不长，领导经验很
    少，怎么样带动大家呢？他左思右想，又征求了几
    个小组长的意见，终于想出了生产竞赛的办法。在钻
    孔队的党和行政支持帮助下，王洪昌小组向全队各
    组发出了生产竞赛的挑战书，挑战书的条件是：一、
    要保证每天钻四公尺深；二、保证质量合乎标准；
    三、保证出勤率达到百分之百；四、全组团结一致，搞好生产。挑战书是贴出去了，但没有一个组应战。有些人说：“这简直是胡闹，也不看看咱们用的是什么机器！”有人甚至说：“这简直是砸锅，不叫咱们吃饭啦！”王洪昌发现群众的思想和使用快速运转法的距离还很大，靠挑战是消灭不了这个距离的。于是他搬到工地休息室去，乘着业余时间，和工友们一起打扑克、聊天，讲述快速运转法的好处，听取群众的意见。他发现绝大多数工友不敢用快速运转法，主要有两大顾虑没有解决。一是怕机器老，出事故。针对这一点，王洪昌就把技术员杨爱飞讲的那些道理告诉大家，并介绍自己小组实际操作的结果。二是有一少部分老技术工人害怕生产效率提高了，一旦机构紧缩，没有活儿干。针对这一点，王洪昌就向他们讲解钻探工作在国家经济建设中的广阔前途。工友们觉得很有道理，以后遇到什么困难，都请王洪昌帮助解决。不久，王洪昌快速运转的先进操作法在全队普遍推广了，各组的生产效率达到四公尺到五公尺。一九五一年十月一日国庆节，王洪昌小组和张景礼小组创造了一天六公尺的新纪录，成为全队的模范小组。
    王洪昌并没有满足自己的工作成绩。当着他考虑怎样进一步提高生产效率的时候，苏联专家来到了二十一工程公司。专家向他们介绍了一次给砂法、采用锥粉管、改善取岩心的办法等一系列的先进经验。王洪昌立刻带领小组作了实地试验。事实证明一次给砂法是完全科学的，只是因为工具不合适——钻杆出水不利，有发生夹钻事故的危险。王洪昌根据苏联的先进经验，结合自己实际工作的体会，改进了工具和操作方法，延长钻孔时间到三小时多，每台机器每日可钻十点二公尺。苏联的先进经验，很快地在全队推广开了。
    工作效率提高了，工友们追求数量的劲头很大。为了防止忽视工程质量的偏向，王洪昌在小组里提出了建立责任制的问题：根据小组情况，决定首先建立合理的交接班制度，强调在交接班时要检查机器，整理工具；同时建立了小组会议制度，每周开一次技术研究会，团结技术人员学习苏联先进经验；每周开一次检讨会，检查一周工作，开展批评与自我批评。在建立责任制的同时，他发现每班交班前半小时就起了钻，而接班的半小时后才能正式生产，一班就要浪费一小时多。他提出交接班不起钻的建议，减少了非生产时间，使工作效率又进一步地提高。一九五二年在钻孔队工会领导下，开展了英雄突击手竞赛运动，全队生产效率平均达到了十公尺多，有的小组达到十二公尺，王洪昌小组达到了十四点八五公尺。全队提前三十三天完成全年任务，并且出现了王洪昌、张景礼、刁歧山、张绍林、隋秉荣等模范小组。
    钻孔队在一九四九年是一个只有三十多人的钻孔灌浆班，到一九五一年发展为拥有六百多人的钻孔队。工人是从四面八方来的，技术很差。必须在短期内培养一批技术工人。王洪昌积极响应党和行政的号召，订出了培养徒弟的计划。从一九五一年到现在，他已经培养了二十三个徒弟，都成为很出色的运转手。谈到教徒弟的问题时，王洪昌说：在旧社会，徒弟不是人当的，我当学徒的时候，吃了无数苦头，却学不到本领。现在我当了师傅，可不能那样对待徒弟了。他说：工人和在课堂上念书的学生不一样，对学徒单纯讲道理是不行的，必须大胆放手地让他们实际操作，在操作当中再详细讲解。年青人聪明肯干，很快就能掌握机器了。王洪昌不仅努力帮助本组的学徒，对别的组的工友也一样地耐心帮助。二十一岁的青年团员邱继春是由农村到钻孔队来，因为组里工友不团结，生产效率提高得很慢。王洪昌一方面帮助邱继春提高操作方法，一方面帮助他们解决组内团结问题，使该组生产效率突飞猛进地赶上了先进小组。
    总起来说：在创造和推广先进经验中发挥共产党员的核心作用，这就是王洪昌领导小组获得一等模范组的根由。
