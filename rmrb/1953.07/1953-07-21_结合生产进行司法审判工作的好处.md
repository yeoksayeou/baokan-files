Editor's Note: In last year's judicial reform movement, people's courts in various regions seriously criticized the old judicial practices of simply sitting in court to hear cases and handling cases in isolation, believing that judicial organs should serve the current central tasks in the most convenient way for the masses. The experience of the people's courts in various parts of Yunnan Province in sending out circuit tribunals to closely integrate adjudication work with spring plowing production is very good. Doing so will not only greatly benefit the people, give full play to the role of the people's judicial work, but also improve the level of judicial cadres in practical work. People's courts in various regions should, according to the central tasks of the local area in a certain period, send out circuit tribunals or use existing fixed court stations under the unified leadership and arrangement of the Party committee and government, and use legal weapons to ensure the smooth completion of central tasks.

After the judicial reform movement, the people's courts in various parts of Yunnan Province fundamentally changed the old judicial practices of simply sitting in court to hear cases and handling cases in isolation, and further gave play to the role of judicial work in serving the current central tasks. In the first half of this year, the people's courts in various parts of the province, under the unified leadership and arrangement of the local Party and government, widely adopted the method of circuit trials, which not only saved the people's time and financial resources, but also closely cooperated with spring plowing production from the judicial work perspective, and was warmly welcomed and supported by the broad masses.

In handling cases, the people's courts in various regions paid special attention to water conservancy disputes that directly affect production, and put forward the slogan "water conservancy first, others second," thus resolving disputes in a timely manner and effectively promoting production. In Yulele Township, Chuxiong Second District, more than 20 Miao families lived on a mountain with more than 40 mu of paddy fields, and more than 50 Han families lived at the foot of the mountain with more than 120 mu of paddy fields. The more than 100 mu of paddy fields on and off the mountain all relied on the same stream of water to soak the fields and plant rice; however, before liberation, the landlords among the Han people at the foot of the mountain monopolized the stream of water, so disputes often occurred over the issue of water. During this year's spring plowing production, the Miao people believed that it was not like before, and Chairman Mao had divided this mountain to them, so the water should naturally be under their control; the Han people believed that they had always used this stream of water to soak the fields, so naturally it should not be an exception this year, so they argued with each other. Yulele Township held four farmers' representative meetings specifically for this issue, but none of them were resolved. On May 29, the circuit tribunal of the Chuxiong County People's Court arrived there. After learning about this situation, they conducted class education for the masses on both sides, making everyone realize that the past disputes were caused by landlords and bullies, and that now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, farmers of all ethnic groups in the world are one family, and everyone should unite and use water rationally. Inspired by this class education, both sides conducted consultations in the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual concession. The Miao people felt that they had few seedlings and there were many seedlings at the foot of the mountain, so they agreed to divide the water into three streams. In addition to keeping one stream for themselves, they let the other two streams to the Han people at the foot of the mountain to save the seedlings. The Han people felt that since their seedlings could be saved, and the problem of planting rice was not as urgent at the foot of the mountain as it was on the mountain, so they voluntarily allowed the Miao people on the mountain to release water first for 25 days during the rice soaking and planting period, thus rationally solving the water conservancy problem for more than 100 mu of paddy fields. In April and May, the Fumin County People's Court, in coordination with relevant departments and production work groups, handled 14 similar cases, solving the water conservancy problems for 10,728 mu of paddy fields and saving 101 mu of small seedlings. Therefore, the masses reflected, "You (the circuit tribunal of the People's Court) have come down, and we can all eat two more mouthfuls of rice!"

In coordinating with spring plowing production, the people's courts in various regions not only resolved water conservancy disputes directly related to production, but also resolved the knots within the people and boosted the masses' production enthusiasm. Xie Wenzhi, a poor peasant in Chenjiachong, Longhe Township, Chuxiong, and his wife, Xie Wenmei, had always had a very bad relationship and quarreled every day, so they had no intention of production. A litter of piglets they raised was so hungry that only two were left. When the masses asked Xie Wenzhi to repair the irrigation ditch, he said lazily, "If the marriage problem is not resolved, I have no strength." When the circuit tribunal of the Chuxiong County People's Court went to the countryside, Xie Wenzhi filed for divorce. After learning about this situation, the tribunal believed that they really could not continue to live together, and that forcing them to do so would not be beneficial to production, so they ruled that they were divorced. Both sides were very satisfied. The next morning, Xie Wenzhi shouldered his hoe and went to work. There are many such examples of promoting production through the correct implementation of the Marriage Law. During the Marriage Law publicity month, the Pingyi County People's Court handled 69 marriage cases in conjunction with the progress of the publicity campaign, and cooperated with the work group to resolve many family disputes, thus greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the masses, especially women. For example, when the masses in Longhai Township were digging an irrigation ditch, they initially did not want women to participate, believing that "women have no strength, just eat less and smoke a pipe." However, many women, because they had solved family problems and recognized the benefits of the Marriage Law, took the initiative to participate, and hundreds of women were actively working on the construction site every day, so that the ditch, which was originally planned to require 5,000 workdays, was completed with only more than 2,000 workdays.

The people's courts in various regions also brought into play the power of the law, promptly punished reactionary elements and bad elements for their sabotage, and ensured the smooth progress of spring plowing production. Yang Chaozhang, a reactionary rich peasant in Beiying Township, Fumin, sabotaged the village's drought resistance and seedling protection measures and rational water use regulations, and released water privately. Some backward masses believed: If Yang Chaozhang can do this, what's wrong with us releasing a little water, so cases of sabotaging water regulations occurred one after another. On May 31, the circuit tribunal of the Fumin County People's Court severely dealt with Yang Chaozhang's destructive behavior, which greatly educated the masses. Since then, no more cases of sabotaging water conservancy have occurred in Beiying Township. Liu Dejian, the former vice chairman of Xiaopo Township, Qujing, had always used his position to embezzle fruits, rape women, and suppress the masses, not allowing them to expose him. The masses were very dissatisfied, and production could not be organized. The lime for building a dam, which had been bought several months ago, was still lying there, and the mutual aid groups had all collapsed. Nearby villages had taken the initiative to contact them several times, but they still could not take action. Not long ago, Liu Dejian privately transported the masses' gasoline barrels to Kunming for sale, and was discovered and stopped by Tang Zhongyu from the same district. Liu Dejian immediately falsely accused Tang Zhongyu in the name of the masses of "oppressing the masses and not allowing them to turn over," and tied Tang Zhongyu to the court. After this case occurred, the masses discussed it even more, and few people attended meetings to discuss production. After deeply understanding this situation and consulting with county-level leading cadres, the Qujing County People's Court immediately severely dealt with this lawless and undisciplined bad element, which won the unanimous support of the masses. Everyone immediately took action, held meetings to discuss building dams and repairing ditches, and said with emotion: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, there is bustling production everywhere. In the past, our village could not do anything. If it were not for the court helping us to deal with this problem, there would not be so many people coming to the meeting tonight."

    结合生产进行司法审判工作的好处
    李燊华
    编者按：在去年的司法改革运动中，各地人民法院都严肃地批判了单纯坐堂问案和孤立办案的旧司法作风，认为司法机关应以最便利群众的方式，为当前的中心工作服务。云南省各地人民法院派出巡回审判组，密切结合春耕生产进行审判工作的经验是很好的。这样作，不仅会大大地便利人民群众，充分发挥人民司法工作的作用，而且还会使司法干部的水平在实际工作中有了提高。各地人民法院都应该根据当地一定时期的中心工作，在党委和政府的统一领导和布置之下，派出巡回审判组，或通过已有的固定审判站，以法律武器保障中心工作的顺利完成。
    云南省各地人民法院经过司法改革运动后，从根本上转变了过去单纯坐堂问案和孤立办案的旧司法作风，进一步发挥了司法工作为当前中心工作服务的作用。今年上半年，该省各地人民法院在当地党政的统一领导与布置下，广泛地采取了巡回审判的方式，不但节省了群众的时间和财力，而且从司法工作方面密切地配合了春耕生产，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎与拥护。
    各地人民法院在办案中对直接影响生产的水利纠纷特别重视，提出了“先水利、后其他”的口号，因而及时地解决了纠纷，有效地推动了生产。楚雄二区鱼乐乡某一山上有四十多工田住的是二十多家苗族，山下有一百二十多工田，住着五十多家汉族。山上山下的这一百多工田都靠同一股水来泡田栽秧；但是，解放前山下汉族中的地主独占了这股水，因此经常为争水的问题发生纠纷。今年春耕生产中，苗族群众认为现在不是从前了，毛主席把这块山分给自己，这股水当然也得归自己管；汉族群众则认为自己向来用这股水泡田，今年自然也不能例外，因此就相互争执起来。鱼乐乡为这个问题专门召开了四次农民代表会都没有得到解决。五月二十九日，楚雄县人民法院巡回审判组到了那里，了解了这个情况后，对双方群众进行了阶级教育，使大家认识到过去的纠纷是地主恶霸所造成的，现在在毛主席领导下天下各族农民是一家，大家应该团结一致，合理用水。在这种阶级教育的启发下，双方都本着互助互让的精神进行了协商，苗族群众觉得自己秧少，山下秧多，同意把水分成三股，除自己留一股外，其他两股让给山下汉族群众救秧。汉族群众觉得既然自己的秧可以救活，至于栽秧问题，山下不比山上，稍缓几天也不要紧，所以也就自愿在泡田栽秧的时候，让山上苗族群众先放水二十五天，这样就使一百多工田的水利问题得到了合理的解决。富民县人民法院协同有关部门与生产工作组，在四、五两个月中处理了同样的案子十四件，解决了一万零七百二十八工田的水利问题，救出了一百零一工田的小秧，因而群众反映说：“你们（人民法庭巡回审判组）下来了，我们都可以多吃两口饭了！”
    各地人民法院在配合春耕生产中，不但解决了与生产直接有关的水利纠纷，而且解开了人民内部的疙瘩，鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。楚雄龙河乡陈家冲贫农谢文治与其妻谢文美一向感情非常恶劣，天天吵架，以致无心生产，喂的一窝小猪，也饿得只剩下两个。群众要谢文治去修水沟，他懒洋洋地说：“婚姻问题得不到解决，我没有力气。”楚雄县人民法院巡回审判组下乡时，谢文治提出离婚要求。审判组了解了这个情况后，认为他们确已无法继续相处，勉强下去，对生产无好处，就判决他们离了婚。这样双方都非常满意，第二天清早，谢文治就扛起锄头去作活去了。这种因正确地贯彻执行了婚姻法而推动生产的事例是很多的。平彝县人民法院在贯彻婚姻法运动月中，结合运动进行情况处理了六十九件婚姻案件，并配合工作组解决了许多家庭纠纷，因而大大地鼓舞了群众特别是妇女的生产情绪。如龙海乡群众挖一条水沟，起初不要妇女参加，认为“妇女没有力气，只要少吃口把旱烟就够了。”但是，很多妇女因为解决了家庭问题，认识了婚姻法的好处，所以都主动地参加，每天有上百的妇女在工地上积极地劳动，以致这条沟原计划要五千工，结果只花了二千多工就完成了。
    各地人民法院还发挥了法律的威力，及时制裁了反动分子和坏分子的破坏，保障了春耕生产的顺利进行。富民北营乡反动富农杨朝章，破坏该村抗旱保苗和合理用水的水规，私自放水。部分落后群众认为：杨朝章还能这样，我们放点水又有什么关系，因此破坏水规的情况相继发生。五月三十一日富民县人民法院巡回审判组严肃地处理了杨朝章的破坏行为，大大地教育了群众，自此以后，北营乡就再没有破坏水利的案件发生。曲靖原小坡乡副主席刘德建，一贯利用职权贪污果实，奸淫妇女，并压制群众，不准揭发。群众非常不满，生产也组织不起来，前几个月买好打坝的石灰，一直还摆着，互助组也都垮了，附近的村子几次来主动联系，也仍旧行动不起来。不久前刘德建又私自将群众的汽油筒运往昆明去卖，被同区唐中玉发现加以阻止，刘德建即假借群众名义诬告唐中玉“压迫群众，不让翻身”，并将唐中玉绑至法院。此案发生以后，群众更是议论纷纷，开会讨论生产，也很少人参加。曲靖县人民法院深入地了解了这个情况，并请示了县级领导干部后，当即严肃地处理了这个违法乱纪的坏分子，获得群众一致的拥护。大家就马上行动起来，开会讨论打坝修沟的事，并感慨地说：“在毛主席领导下，到处都是热闹闹的搞生产，过去我们村是什么也搞不起来，这次要不是法院帮我们处理了这个问题，今晚也不会有这么多人来开会。”
