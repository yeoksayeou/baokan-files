    Persist to Victory
    Xu Zhaoqun
    Tang Fengxi, a first-class meritorious volunteer soldier and recipient of the North Korean "Second Class Warrior Honor Medal," recently returned to China from the Korean front to attend the Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. When I visited him, he excitedly narrated to me the story of one of his battles.
    It was in late October 1951 when a platoon of the Volunteer Army, guarding the 68th position on a high ground near Kimhwa, launched a fierce blocking battle against the invading enemy. The battle lasted for three days and nights. The American army used two battalions of troops, supported by artillery and aircraft, to launch more than 20 attacks on this position, but they failed to get even one man up onto it.
    On the third night of the battle, the Volunteer Army's blocking squad, which was holding this position, received an order from the company to rotate shifts. When the squad returned to the company command post, the company commander suddenly discovered that Tang Fengxi was missing from the squad and asked the squad leader, "Why didn't Tang Fengxi come down?" The squad leader said, "He went to the platoon leader in the evening to get in contact and hasn't returned."
    The company commander, remembering that Tang Fengxi had written thirteen letters of determination before the battle in order to join the blocking squad, was worried when he found out that he was missing. Everyone was concerned about Tang Fengxi.
    Just then, a burst of fierce gunfire and grenade explosions suddenly erupted on the 68th position. Hearing this, the comrades were surprised, "What's going on? Didn't the deputy company commander just leave from there? The messenger just returned to the battalion headquarters to say that the brother troops had gone to outflank the enemy, so who is fighting the enemy?"
    It turned out that it was Tang Fengxi, who they were concerned about, who was fighting the enemy.
    That day, before it was dark, machine gun group leader Tang Fengxi accepted the mission to go to the other side of the hillside to contact the platoon leader. Tang Fengxi, carrying his automatic rifle, quietly inserted himself to the platoon leader's position from the hillside. However, when he crawled back to the 68th position from under the enemy's blockade of fire, it was already getting dark.
        "Deputy Platoon Leader! Deputy Platoon Leader!" He shouted a few times, but no one answered. Tang Fengxi was a little anxious, and he groped toward the dark bomb crater, feeling a few stones, then feeling a few grenades, and then groping forward, he touched the stiff corpse of an American soldier, but he could not find his own people. He sat in the bomb crater thinking. Suddenly, he heard rustling footsteps coming from a distance, and as he listened quietly, the sound became smaller and smaller. He thought of getting up and chasing after them—no! He immediately calmed down again. "It won't work if there's no one on the position! I can't leave!" Just as he made up his mind, a row of enemy bullets flew over, whizzing against the nearby rocks and emitting a spark. It turned out that four American soldiers were groping towards the 68th position.
    Tang Fengxi quickly made preparations; he uncovered the grenade cap and conveniently inserted it into his waist; he jumped out of the bomb crater, staring intently at the crawling enemy. The enemy fired a few rows of shots, but there was no echo from the hilltop, and they crawled forward even more triumphantly. Tang Fengxi remembered what the platoon leader had told him yesterday: "The position is important! We must hold it even if only one person is left." Thinking of this, his courage increased even more. As the enemy crawled closer, Tang Fengxi suddenly threw a grenade, and the grenade exploded in the enemy's midst; Tang Fengxi quickly jumped behind the earthen cliff, flipped the bolt, and fiercely shot at the crawling enemy.
    The enemy counterattacked five times, but each time they were repulsed.
    The sixth time was even fiercer than the previous few. A shell exploded next to Tang Fengxi, and his face and hands, already covered in blood, emerged from the collapsed bomb crater. Enduring the pain, he struggled out, not bothering to see where he was injured, and crawled closer to the machine gun, continuing to pull the trigger. He knew that the bullets were already gone, but the enemy's shells were still exploding around him, and the enemy was attacking again. At this critical moment, he suddenly thought of using the enemy's bullets to eliminate the enemy. He found bullets on the enemy's corpses, firing as he went, and throwing grenades. In just a few minutes, Tang Fengxi repelled the enemy's sixth attack.
    In the past three days, Tang Fengxi had single-handedly destroyed an enemy platoon with grenades and led two squads in more than a dozen assaults against the enemy. After these days of fierce fighting, coupled with the waves of pain from his wounds, he was unable to support himself any longer. He collapsed weakly against a low-lying area, his mind filled with confused thoughts. One moment he thought of his hometown on the right bank of the Yalu River, the beautiful mountains and clear waters of Zhuanghe County, Liaodong Province; the next, he thought of his mother's instructions on the day he joined the army: "Be a good soldier of Chairman Mao in the army." Half a month ago, his mother had also written to say that five new houses had been built at home and that they had joined the production cooperative. Comparing this with the painful life eight years ago when he worked for the landlord and his mother begged for food, Tang Fengxi understood from the bottom of his heart that these benefits were brought by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. One moment he thought of the instructor's teachings: to learn from the Communists in battle. He also remembered the tragic scene a month ago when the landlord's three lovely children were killed by enemy aircraft. Thinking of these things, he silently swore in his heart: In order to defend the motherland and the Korean people, I must persist in fighting. Just then, "Crack! Crack!" Two gunshots rang out, from somewhere unknown. There were many people clamoring on the back hillside. Hearing this, Tang Fengxi immediately prepared to repel the enemy's seventh attack. But his body would not obey his commands, and no matter how hard he tried, he could not move. He only had one grenade left in his hand, so he pulled out the pin and gripped the handle tightly. He had only one thought: Even if I die, I won't let you live. As long as I am here, I will never let the position be lost!
    A few minutes passed. He stared intently and saw that the shells were coming from the north, hitting the enemy like rockets. Then, a dark mass of people came from the back hillside. Tang Fengxi understood immediately.
    "Our own troops are here!"
        "So it's you!" The deputy company commander walked up to Tang Fengxi and hugged him, saying, "You persisted to victory!"
    Tang Fengxi looked straight at the deputy company commander, so excited that he didn't know what to say. (Attached picture)

    坚持到胜利
    许钊群
    志愿军一等功臣，朝鲜“二级战士荣誉勋章”获得者唐凤喜，最近从朝鲜前线回国，列席中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会。在我访问他的时候，他兴奋地向我叙述了他的一次战斗的故事。
    那是在一九五一年十月下旬，守卫在金城附近某高地六十八号阵地上的志愿军的一个排，向侵犯这个阵地的敌人展开了激烈的阻击战。战斗连续进行了三昼夜，美军曾用了两个营的兵力，配合大炮飞机向这个阵地发动了二十多次攻击，但他们一个人也没能爬上这个阵地。
    在战斗的第三天晚上，坚守这个阵地的志愿军的一个阻击班，接到连里要他们换防的命令。当这个班回到连指挥所的时候，连长忽然发现班里缺了个唐凤喜，就问班长：“唐凤喜怎么没下来？”班长说：“傍晚他到排长那里去取联络，一直没有回来。”
    连长想起这位在战前为了参加阻击班而写了十三次决心书的唐凤喜，现在竟不知去向，心里着急起来，大家也在为唐凤喜眈心。
    就在这时，突然在六十八号阵地上响起一阵激烈的枪声和手雷声。同志们听了，都感到诧异，“怎么搞的，副连长他们不是刚从那儿出发了吗？刚才通讯员往营部回来说，兄弟部队去迂回敌人去了，那末，这是谁跟敌人打上了呢？”
    原来这就是他们所眈心的唐凤喜在和敌人战斗。
    这天，天还没有黑的时候，机枪组长唐凤喜接受了前往山坡那面和排长取联系的任务。唐凤喜端着自动步枪，从山腰上悄悄地插到排长那儿去。可是当他从敌人封锁的火网下再爬回到六十八号阵地的时候，天色已黑矇矇的了。
        “副排长！副排长！”他喊了几声没有人回答。唐凤喜有点急，他向黑忽忽的弹坑摸过去，碰到的是几块石头，摸到的是几颗手榴弹，再往前摸去，又碰到了僵死的美国兵尸体，但是就没有找到自己的人。他坐在弹坑里沉思着。突然听到从远方传来了沙沙的脚步声，静听下去，声音越来越小了。他想起身追上去——不！他马上又镇静下来。“阵地上没有人那能行！我不能走！”他刚拿定主意，敌人的一排子子弹飞过来，唰唰地打在附近的山石上，冒出一股火花。原来是四个美国兵向六十八号阵地摸上来了。
    唐凤喜敏捷地作好了准备工作；把手雷盖揭好，顺手插在腰间；跃出弹坑，紧紧地盯着爬来的敌人。敌人打了几排子枪，山头上没有一点回音，更得意忘形地向前爬着。唐凤喜记起昨天排长告诉他的话：“阵地重要！剩下一个人也要守住。”想到这里，他的勇气更增加了。敌人爬得更近了，唐凤喜猛然扔出一颗手雷，手雷在敌人群中爆炸开来；唐凤喜又迅速地跳到土崖后面，扳动枪机，猛烈地射击着爬过来的敌人。
    敌人反扑了五次，每次都被打退了。
    第六次，比先前几次来得更凶。一颗炮弹在唐凤喜身边爆炸了，他从被炸塌的弹坑里露出脸和手，已经觉得脸上手上都沾满了鲜血。他忍受着疼痛，挣扎出来，顾不得看究竟是那儿受伤了，又爬近机枪，继续去扣扳机，他知道子弹已经打光了，可是敌人的炮弹仍在他周围爆炸着，敌人又向前扑来。就在这千钧一发的时刻，他忽然想到：利用敌人的子弹去消灭敌人。他从敌人的尸体上找到了子弹，一边射击，一边又扔出手榴弹。在短短的几分钟里，唐凤喜又打退了第六次进攻的敌人。
    在过去的三天里，唐凤喜一个人曾用手雷打垮了敌人一个班，指挥两个组和敌人冲了十几次。经过这几天的激烈的战斗，再加上伤口阵阵疼痛，他已无力支持了。他瘫软地倚在一块洼地上，脑子里想的事情很杂乱，一忽儿想到鸭绿江右岸山青水秀的故乡——辽东省庄河县；想到参军那天母亲嘱告说：“到部队里要做一个毛主席的好战士。”半月前母亲还来信说，家里盖了五间新房子，参加了生产合作社。这和八年前自己给地主扛活、妈妈讨饭的痛苦生活一对照，唐凤喜打心眼里明白，这些好处是共产党、毛主席带来的。他一忽儿又想起指导员教导他的话：要在战斗中向共产党员学习。又想起一个月以前，房东的三个可爱的孩子被敌机炸死的惨状。想到这些，他在心中默默地宣誓：为了保卫祖国、保卫朝鲜人民，我一定要坚持战斗下去。正在这当儿，“啪！啪！”两声枪响，不知从那儿打来的。后山坡有不少人吵嚷着。唐凤喜听了，马上准备迎击敌人第七次的攻击。可是他的身子不听使唤了，他用尽力量仍是动弹不了，手里只剩下了一颗手雷，他掏出弹弦，握紧弹柄。只有一个想法：我死，也叫你们活不成，有我在，决不让阵地丢掉！
    几分钟过去了。他定睛一看，炮弹是从北方来的，就像火箭一般向敌人打过去。接着是黑压压的人群从后山坡上来了。唐凤喜一看，心里早就明白了。
    “自己的部队来啦！”
        “原来是你呀！”副连长走到唐凤喜跟前一把抱住他说：“你坚持到胜利了！”
    唐凤喜两眼直看着副连长，一时兴奋得不知说什么好了。（附图片）
