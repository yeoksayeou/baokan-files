Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 4th (Special Correspondent Jiang Nan) – As Robertson's talks with Syngman Rhee continue, Syngman Rhee is now preparing to take new steps to further undermine the realization of the Korean armistice.

Robertson held his eighth meeting with Syngman Rhee today since arriving in Korea. According to reports from Seoul, the focus of the talks is Syngman Rhee's insistence that if the political conference fails to produce a solution to the Korean issue satisfactory to him within three months, the United States should join him in restarting the war. The report said that the two sides have not yet reached a "satisfactory solution" on this point.

Robertson said after today's talks that he is prepared to meet with Syngman Rhee again. As for Syngman Rhee, while he is talking with Robertson, he is drawing more and more South Korean troops from the regular army under Clark's command and assigning them to the South Korean constabulary, which is not under Clark's command. A large number of Rhee's army officers have been ordered to enter the Busan area. American news agencies have speculated that Syngman Rhee may use these troops to hijack all the non-repatriated prisoners of war still remaining in the U.S. POW camps near Busan.

At the same time, the prisoners of war "released" by Syngman Rhee are being transported in truckloads to the Rhee army's replacement stations. This blatant action began on July 1st. Now even the Americans themselves admit that these prisoners of war are being forced to join the Rhee army. International News Service reported that "senior American officials" in Korea commented on the matter, saying that "these prisoners of war are joining the army under 'intimidation'," and if they do not join, Syngman Rhee "will stop supplying them with food and other assistance." Facing the fate of being forced to serve as cannon fodder, the prisoners of war now hope to return to the POW camps.

Syngman Rhee has also organized a group of "released" prisoners of war to attack U.S. military warehouses on the western front in Korea.

All of this shows that Syngman Rhee is desperately struggling like a madman, trying to coerce the Americans into sabotaging the realization of the armistice with him. In his proclamation today for the American Independence Day, he clamored that he would "never give up the struggle halfway" and said that this is the "only way" to commemorate July 4th. This is not only a mockery but also an insult to the spirit of independence and democracy of the American people and to the American pioneer Washington.

According to a report by the Associated Press reporter from Tokyo, Syngman Rhee is holding five "trump cards" to sabotage the armistice:

	1. Sending Rhee's troops into the POW camps to "release" the remaining non-repatriated prisoners of war;
	2. Refusing to withdraw Rhee's troops from the demilitarized zone;
	3. Sending "guerrillas" to attack the rear of the U.S. and other countries' troops after the armistice;
	4. Ordering the South Koreans working at the docks in Busan and Incheon to transport supplies for the U.S. military to stop working;
	5. Not allowing U.S. troops to use the South Korean railways.

As the ancient Chinese proverb says, "An ant trying to shake a big tree," he overestimates himself. It is the peace-loving people of the world, and certainly not political thugs like Syngman Rhee, who determine the fate of history. World public opinion unanimously demands the realization of the Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Syngman Rhee wants the American people to continue to shed blood for his evil government, but the American people are not willing to be fooled. Even Walter Reuther, president of the CIO, admitted that 99.9 percent of Americans hope and pray for peace in Korea as soon as possible. The power of the people is irresistible. That is why American news agencies are transmitting more and more discussions from Washington, Tokyo, and Seoul, advocating that even if Syngman Rhee does not want an armistice, the United States should be prepared to sign the armistice agreement.

### 李承晚阴谋采取新步骤破坏停战

    李承晚阴谋采取新步骤破坏停战
    【新华社开城四日电】本社特派记者江南报道：正当罗伯逊与李承晚的会谈仍在继续进行之际，李承晚现在准备采取新的步骤来进一步破坏朝鲜停战的实现。
    罗伯逊今天又和李承晚作了他到朝鲜以来的第八次会谈。据汉城传出的消息说，会谈的焦点是李承晚坚持要求当政治会议在三个月内未能得出令他满意的解决朝鲜问题的办法时，美国应和他一起重新发动战争。消息说，双方迄今还没有对这点获致“满意的解决办法”。
    罗伯逊在今天的会谈后说，他还准备再和李承晚会谈。李承晚呢？他在和罗伯逊会谈的同时，正在把越来越多的南朝鲜军队从克拉克管辖下的正规军里抽调出来，把它们编到不属于克拉克指挥的南朝鲜宪兵部队里去。大批李伪军的军官已经奉命进入釜山地区。美国的通讯社纷纷猜测说，李承晚可能要用这些军队来劫走还留在釜山附近美方战俘营里的全部不直接遣返的战俘。
    同时，被李承晚“释放”的战俘正在一卡车一卡车地被运到李伪军的补充站去。这种公然的行动是从七月一日开始的。现在连美国人自己也承认这些战俘是被迫参加李伪军的。国际新闻社报道说，在朝鲜的“美国高级人士”评论这件事说，“这些战俘是在‘吓诈之下’参加军队的”，如果他们不参加，李承晚“就将停止供给他们粮食与其他帮助”。面临着被迫充当炮灰的命运的战俘，现在都希望回到战俘营里去。
    李承晚还组织了一批“被释放的”战俘袭击在朝鲜西线的美军仓库。
    这一切都表明：李承晚正在发了疯似地作绝望的挣扎，要挟美国人跟他一起破坏停战的实现。他今天在为美国独立纪念日而发表的文告中叫嚣他“决不中途放弃斗争”，并说这是纪念七月四日的“唯一方法”。这对于美国人民的独立、民主的精神，对于美国人民的先辈华盛顿，不仅是嘲弄，而且是污辱。
    据美联社记者发自东京的消息说，李承晚手里拿着破坏停战的五张“王牌”：
    一、派李伪军冲进战俘营去“释放”余留下来的不直接遣返的战俘；
    二、拒绝将李伪军撤出非军事区；
    三、停战后派“游击队”袭击美国和其他国家的军队的后方；
    四、命令在釜山和仁川的码头上为美军搬运物资的南朝鲜人停止工作；
    五、不许美国军队使用南朝鲜铁路。
    像中国古谚所说的，“蜉蝣撼大树”，他太不自量了。决定历史命运的是爱好和平的世界人民，而绝不是李承晚这样的政治恶棍。世界舆论一致要求实现朝鲜停战，要求和平解决朝鲜问题。李承晚想叫美国人民继续为他的恶政府流血，但是美国人民是不肯上这个当的。甚至美国产联主席路德也承认，美国人中有百分之九十九点九都是希望并祈祷朝鲜能及早获得和平。人民的力量是不可抗御的。这就是为什么美国通讯社自华盛顿、东京和汉城传出来越来越多的议论，主张即使李承晚不愿停战，美国也应准备在停战协定上签字。
