The Korean armistice negotiations, which lasted two years and half a month, have now reached a full agreement due to the persistent struggle of the Korean and Chinese people and their armed forces, and the enormous efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, after numerous twists and turns. The Korean Armistice Agreement, so longed for by the whole world, was signed at Panmunjom on July 27, 1953. As stated in the armistice order issued by Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, "The signing of the Armistice Agreement is the first step towards resolving the Korean issue by peaceful means, and is therefore conducive to peace in the Far East and the world. It has been warmly supported by the people of Korea and China and has greatly encouraged peace-loving people all over the world."

The great and just anti-aggression war waged by the Korean and Chinese people, and their victory in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, proves that the just struggle of the awakened people of Asia to bravely resist aggression and defend peace is invincible; proves that the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is inviolable; and proves that the forces of world peace and democracy are infinitely powerful.

Three years ago, the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique, in collusion with the U.S. warmongers, launched the Korean War, seriously threatening peace and security in the Far East and the world. International adventurers vainly attempted to annex the entire Korean peninsula, further invade China, and provoke a new world war; even if they could not do so, they could at least maintain a state of world tension, make a fortune through war and war preparation plans, and delay the outbreak of an economic crisis. However, when they decided on their adventurous actions, they overestimated their own strength and underestimated the strength of the Asian and world people. They were unwilling to see the profound changes in the Asian situation after World War II, especially after the victory of the Chinese revolution. However, those who are unwilling to acknowledge the facts are bound to run into a wall. The heroic Korean and Chinese people gave the aggressors a head-on blow, contained this largest-scale and most insane act of aggression carried out by the imperialist camp with all its might after World War II, and plunged the international adventurers themselves into chaos, embarrassment, and danger. Their timetable for launching a new world war was not accelerated but postponed. Political leaders in various countries on Syngman Rhee's side with cooler heads increasingly saw clearly that stopping the Korean War and resolving the Korean question by peaceful means was the only option before them.

The Korean question was originally one of the many unresolved international issues after World War II. Like other major international issues, it originally had the necessary basis for seeking a solution by peaceful means. In December 1945, the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain reached an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. If this agreement could have been respected and fulfilled, as faithfully adhered to by the Soviet government, the Korean people could have achieved the unification, independence, and democratic development of their motherland long ago, and the Korean War would not have broken out. However, the policy pursued by the U.S. government in Korea after the war was to divide North and South Korea, support the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique, and finally launch the war of aggression against Korea, attempting to unify Korea by force, that is, to overthrow the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and establish a reactionary autocratic rule against the people throughout Korea. Not only that, but the U.S. government, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, also occupied our country's Taiwan, and shortly thereafter ordered its invading forces in Korea to cross the 38th parallel and attack the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on our northeast border, directly creating a serious threat to our country's security. The U.S. government's pursuit of this adventurous policy was not truly abandoned even after it had to accept Korean armistice negotiations due to the failure of the war. This is the reason why the Korean armistice negotiations were delayed for as long as two years.

Contrary to the U.S. foreign policy, the Korean and Chinese people have consistently advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The purpose of our forced participation in the anti-aggression war was also to strive for conditions to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean question on a fair and reasonable basis. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese people, in the tortuous and winding negotiation process of the past two years, have always fought with great determination and forbearance to strive for an agreement in the armistice negotiations. Recently, due to the tremendous efforts made by Korea and China to resolve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, which was the only obstacle to the armistice agreement, and to stop the sabotage of the Syngman Rhee clique, the Korean armistice was finally realized, which is a fact obvious to all. At the same time, as stated in the statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the Korean question on April 1 this year, "The Soviet government has consistently supported all steps aimed at achieving a just armistice and ending the Korean War." The support of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries of the world for the policy of the Korean and Chinese people to adhere to a peaceful resolution of the Korean question has played a significant role in the realization of the Korean armistice.

The process of the Korean War and the armistice negotiations clearly proves that as long as the people of all countries in the world resolutely take on the cause of peace, the spirit of consultation can overcome force. In the Korean War, the United States mobilized most of its army, navy, and air force, and also gathered the armies of seventeen countries, suffering more than one million casualties and spending 20 billion U.S. dollars, but still could not win the war; while the Korean and Chinese People's forces became stronger and stronger in battle, continuously achieving brilliant victories. In the counterattack war of our army in the past half month alone, we defeated the positions of four enemy divisions and annihilated more than 40,000 enemy troops. This shows that the path of resolving international issues by force is unworkable. On the contrary, as long as we adhere to the spirit of consultation, the Korean armistice negotiations, which seemed to have no way out many times, can still eventually find a compromise solution acceptable to both sides. Therefore, the peaceful resolution of all other international disputes or outstanding issues is not impossible either. Of course, this possibility depends, on the one hand, on the relevant countries having the desire to consult with each other and the spirit of treating each other as equals, and on the other hand, on the active struggle of the people of all countries in the world to win peace.

Now that the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, it is by no means without obstacles to ensure that all the provisions of this armistice agreement are effectively observed and implemented. The people of the world must still be vigilant at all times against some warmongers on the U.S. side, especially Syngman Rhee of South Korea, who are stepping up their clamor against the armistice. This "warrior" in the U.S. goldfish bowl (the youth of more than a dozen countries in the world have inexplicably shed a lot of blood for the ambitions of this stubborn dictator, simply because someone in Washington needs him) threatens to "take unilateral action" to undermine the armistice. He sees through the two-sidedness of U.S. policy, so he recklessly resorts to hooliganism, lying down on the road to armistice, attempting to block the wheels of peace in Korea. Therefore, the question now depends entirely on whether the United States will continue to condone the Syngman Rhee clique, or whether it is willing to change this attitude of condoning. Chief Delegate Nam Il already pointed out in his statement on July 19: "If the United Nations Command continues this policy of condoning the South Korean government and its army, then both before and after the armistice, the implementation of the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement may continue to be undermined. This is something that governments and peoples of all countries in the world, especially the governments and peoples of the countries concerned on both sides of the Korean War, must pay serious attention to. We believe that if such a situation occurs at any time, the United Nations Command must strictly implement the solemn guarantee it has already made based on the inspections and judgments of the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as well as the just demands of peace-loving people all over the world."

It is worth noting that some powerful figures in the United States still openly support Syngman Rhee's activities to undermine the armistice. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles even issued a statement as late as the 22nd of this month to encourage Syngman Rhee's frantic clamor to undermine the Korean armistice, saying that Syngman Rhee "has the right to do so." In the statement, Dulles admitted that Syngman Rhee had not accepted the armistice, "He has always reserved the claims of his government." What Dulles referred to as Syngman Rhee's claim is that Syngman Rhee has been shouting that he will only not obstruct the armistice for ninety days; if the United States cannot enable him to achieve the goal of "unifying Korea" within ninety days, then he will "resume the war." Dulles believes that Syngman Rhee "has the right to do so," which is to openly encourage Syngman Rhee to "resume the war." But as everyone knows, the U.S. negotiating representative guaranteed to our side on July 13 that "the armistice has no time limit." We want to ask: Is it the guarantee of the U.S. negotiating representative that counts? Or is it Dulles's "statement" that counts? Three years ago, Dulles personally came forward to plan the launch of the Korean War for Syngman Rhee, causing the Korean peninsula to be awash in blood; now Dulles is openly encouraging Syngman Rhee to undermine the implementation of the Korean armistice. As the U.S. government, as one of the parties responsible for the Korean armistice, has a full responsibility to stop and clarify Dulles's absurd words and deeds.

The attitude of the Korean and Chinese side towards the Korean armistice is clear and firm. The Korean and Chinese side firmly abides by and implements all the provisions of the armistice agreement, as stipulated in the armistice order issued to our troops by Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers: "All personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' army, air force, navy, and coastal defense forces should resolutely abide by the armistice agreement and completely cease fire across the entire line from 22:00 on July 27, 1953, that is, twelve hours after the signing of the armistice agreement; within seventy-two hours from 22:00 on July 27, 1953, that is, seventy-two hours after the armistice agreement takes effect, the entire line should uniformly withdraw two kilometers behind the military demarcation line already announced by both sides, and shall not enter the demilitarized zone one step further." However, the order also stipulates: "All personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' army, air force, navy, and coastal defense forces should maintain a high degree of vigilance, hold their positions, and prevent any aggression and sabotage from the other side." This fully demonstrates our serious attitude towards ensuring the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement. If the Syngman Rhee clique and the South Korean army dare to take action, as they have been clamoring, to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement, then the Korean and Chinese People's forces must take anti-aggression self-defense actions in accordance with the armistice agreement and the guarantees provided by the U.S. side on July 11 and July 13 successively, to effectively ensure the implementation of the armistice. The Korean and Chinese people absolutely do not want such a thing to happen. The Korean and Chinese people demand that the world earnestly supervise the U.S. side to strictly control the Syngman Rhee clique, which it has full power and ability to control.

Of course, in order to further achieve a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean question, it remains for a higher-level political conference to consult. Regarding this issue, the Korean and Chinese side has consistently advocated that all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, withdraw from Korea, and that the Korean question be resolved peacefully in the spirit of the Korean people handling their own affairs themselves, in order to facilitate the establishment of a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent new Korea. This is the solemn task of the higher-level political conference. This higher-level political conference was proposed by the commanders of both sides of the Korean War to the governments of the countries concerned, to be convened within three months after the Korean Armistice Agreement takes effect. It must be convened on the basis of equal consultation in order to obtain good results. The Korean and Chinese people, and all peace-loving people throughout the world, sincerely hope that this higher-level political conference can be convened smoothly and that it can resolve the issue. We must continue to fight to the end for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Any warmongers who dare to use the political conference to undermine the armistice and sabotage the political conference will inevitably suffer the most resolute opposition from the Korean and Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, and will suffer even greater failures.

### 和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步

    和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步
    历时两年零半个月的朝鲜停战谈判，由于朝中人民及其武装力量坚持奋斗和全世界爱好和平人民的巨大努力，在经过种种曲折之后，现在已经全部达成了协议。全世界所渴望的朝鲜停战协定于一九五三年七月二十七日在板门店签字了。正如金日成元帅和彭德怀将军发布的停战命令中所说的：“停战协定的签订是以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的第一步，因而是有利于远东及世界和平的。它获得了朝中两国人民的热烈拥护，使全世界爱好和平人民受到了莫大的鼓舞。”
    朝中人民伟大的正义的反侵略战争和争取和平解决朝鲜问题的这个胜利，证明了亚洲觉醒了的人民英勇地抵抗侵略、保卫和平的正义斗争是不可战胜的；证明了以苏联为首的世界和平阵营是不可侵犯的；证明了世界和平民主力量是无限强大的。
    三年以前，李承晚反动集团和美国好战分子相勾结，发动了朝鲜战争，严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平与安全。国际冒险家们妄想并吞整个朝鲜，进一步侵犯中国，挑起新的世界大战；即使不能如此，他们至少也可以保持世界的紧张局势，利用战争和准备战争的计划大发横财，拖延经济危机的爆发。但是他们决定自己的冒险行动的时候，过高估计了他们自己的力量，而过低估计了亚洲和世界人民的力量。他们不愿意看到第二次世界大战以后特别是中国革命胜利以后的深刻变化了的亚洲局势。然而，不愿意承认事实的人们照例是要碰壁的。英勇的朝中人民给了侵略者以迎头痛击，遏止了第二次世界大战后帝国主义阵营竭尽全力所进行的这一最大规模的和最疯狂的侵略行动，使国际冒险家们自己陷于混乱、狼狈和危险之中。他们发动新的世界大战的时间表不是加速了而是推迟了。站在李承晚方面的各国头脑比较冷静的政治领袖越来越看清楚：停止朝鲜战争，用和平方式来解决朝鲜问题，乃是他们面前唯一可以选择的出路。
    朝鲜问题本来是第二次世界大战后许多悬而未决的国际问题之一。它和其他重大的国际问题一样，原是具有必要的基础可以用和平方式来求得解决的。一九四五年十二月莫斯科苏美英三国外长会议就曾对和平解决朝鲜问题达成了协议。如果这个协议能够得到尊重和履行，像苏联政府所忠实遵守的那样，那么，朝鲜人民早就可以获得祖国的统一独立和民主发展，朝鲜战争也不至于爆发。然而，战后美国政府在朝鲜执行的政策，是分裂南北朝鲜，扶植李承晚反动集团，并终于发动了侵朝战争，企图以武力统一朝鲜亦即推翻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，在全朝鲜建立反人民的反动专制统治。不仅这样，美国政府在发动侵朝战争的同时，还侵占了我国的台湾，并且在不久以后命令它的侵朝军队越过三八线，向我国东北边境的鸭绿江和图们江进攻，直接造成了对我国安全的严重威胁。美国政府执行的这种冒险政策，直到它由于战争的失利而不得不接受朝鲜停战谈判以后，也并没有真正放弃。朝鲜停战谈判所以拖延达两年之久，原因就在这里。
    和美国的外交政策相反，朝中人民一贯地主张和平解决朝鲜问题。我们被迫进行反侵略战争的目的，也是为了争取条件使朝鲜问题得以在公平合理的基础上获致和平解决。因此，朝中人民在两年来迂回曲折的谈判过程中，始终以极大的坚定性和忍让精神，为争取停战谈判获得协议而斗争。最近，由于朝中两国对解决唯一阻碍停战协议的战俘遣返问题和制止李承晚集团的破坏作了巨大的努力，朝鲜停战才得以最后实现，这是有目共睹的事实。同时，正如本年四月一日苏联外交部长莫洛托夫关于朝鲜问题的声明中所说的：“苏联政府一贯支持一切旨在达成公正的停战和结束朝鲜战争的步骤。”苏联和世界各国人民对于朝中人民坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的政策的支持，对于朝鲜停战的实现起了显著的作用。
    朝鲜战争和停战谈判的过程清楚地证明：只要世界各国人民坚决地把和平事业担当起来，协商精神就能够战胜武力。在朝鲜战争中，美国出动了大部分的海陆空军，还纠集了十七个国家的军队，伤亡逾百万人，耗资达二百亿美元，仍然不能赢得战争；而朝中人民部队却越战越强，不断取得辉煌的胜利。最近半个多月我军的反击战，就打垮了敌人四个师的阵地，歼灭了敌人四万余名。由此可见，以武力解决国际问题的路是走不通的。反之，只要坚持协商的精神，多少次山穷水尽疑无路的朝鲜停战谈判，最后仍然可以找到双方都可以接受的妥协的方案，那么，其他所有国际争端或悬案的和平解决，也就不是不可能的了。当然，这种可能性，一方面固然要取决于有关国家之间必须具有彼此协商的愿望和以平等对待的精神，另一方面还要取决于世界各国人民积极进行争取和平的斗争。
    现在朝鲜停战协定虽然已经签字了，但是要使这个停战协定的全部条款被切实遵守和执行，还绝不是没有阻碍的。全世界人民还必须时刻警惕美国方面的一部分好战分子，特别是南朝鲜的李承晚，正在加紧叫嚣反对停战。这个美国金鱼缸里的“勇士”（世界上十几个国家的青年已经为这个顽固的独夫的野心而莫名其妙地流了大量的鲜血，仅仅因为华盛顿有人需要他）威胁着要“采取片面政策”来破坏停战。他看透了美国政策的两面性，于是他就放肆地耍起流氓手段，躺倒在停战的道路上，企图挡住朝鲜和平的车轮。因此现在的问题完全要看美国对于李承晚集团究竟是继续纵容下去呢，还是愿意改变这种纵容的态度？我方首席代表南日大将在七月十九日的声明中已经指出：“如果联合国军对南朝鲜政府及其军队的这种纵容政策继续下去，则不论在停战前后，朝鲜停战协定条款的实施均有继续遭受破坏的可能。这是全世界各国政府和各国人民、特别是朝鲜交战双方有关各国的政府和人民所必须严重注意的。我们认为，任何时候如果有这样的情况发生，联合国军方面必须依据军事停战委员会和中立国委员会的视察判断以及全世界爱好和平人民的公正要求来严格执行其自身已经提出的庄严保证。”
    值得注意的就是美国一部分有权势的人物至今仍然公开支持李承晚破坏停战的活动。美国国务卿杜勒斯直到本月二十二日还发表声明，对于李承晚破坏朝鲜停战的疯狂叫嚣加以鼓励，说李承晚
    “有权利这样做”。杜勒斯在声明中承认，李承晚并没有接受停战，“他一直保留着他的政府的主张”。杜勒斯所指的李承晚的这个什么主张，就是李承晚一直叫嚷的他仅仅在九十天之内不阻挠停战；如果美国在九十天之内不能使他达到“统一朝鲜”的目的，那么他就要“恢复战争”。杜勒斯认为李承晚“有权利这样做”，就是公开鼓励李承晚“恢复战争”。但是尽人皆知，美方谈判代表在七月十三日向我方保证“停战没有时间限制”。我们要问：到底是美方谈判代表的保证算数呢？还是杜勒斯的“声明”算数呢？杜勒斯在三年前亲自出马为李承晚策划发动朝鲜战争，使朝鲜血流成河；现在杜勒斯又公开鼓励李承晚破坏朝鲜停战的实施。对于杜勒斯这样的荒谬言行，作为对朝鲜停战负责一方的美国政府，完全有责任加以制止和澄清。
    朝中方面对于朝鲜停战的态度是明确而坚定的。朝中方面坚决遵守和执行停战协定的一切条款，正如朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军向我方部队发布的停战命令中所规定的：“朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的陆军、空军、海军、海防部队全体人员应坚决遵守停战协定，自一九五三年七月二十七日二十二时起，即停战协定签字后的十二小时起，全线完全停火；在一九五三年七月二十七日二十二时起的七十二小时内，即停战协定生效后的七十二小时内，全线一律自双方已经公布的军事分界线后撤二公里，并一律不得再进入非军事区一步。”但是，命令中同时规定：“朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的陆军、空军、海军、海防部队全体人员应保持高度戒备，坚守阵地，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和破坏行动。”这充分表明了我方保障停战协定彻底实现的严肃态度。如果李承晚集团和南朝鲜军队敢于像它们所叫嚷的那样，采取行动来破坏停战协定的实现，那末，朝中人民部队就一定要根据停战协定以及美方在七月十一日和七月十三日先后所提供的保证，采取反侵略的自卫行动，以切实保障停战的实施。朝中人民绝对不愿意这样的事情竟会发生。朝中人民要求全世界认真监督美国方面严格控制它所完全有权力有能力控制的李承晚集团。
    当然，为了使整个朝鲜问题进一步获得和平解决，还有待于高一级的政治会议的协商。关于这个问题，朝中方面一贯主张一切外国军队包括中国人民志愿军在内撤出朝鲜，朝鲜问题在朝鲜人自己处理自己问题的精神下和平解决，以利于一个统一、民主、和平、独立的新朝鲜的建立。这就是高一级政治会议的庄严任务。这个高一级的政治会议是朝鲜战争双方司令官建议各有关国家政府，在朝鲜停战协定生效后三个月内召开的。它必须是在平等协商的基础上召开，才有可能得到良好的结果。朝中人民及全世界一切爱好和平人民，衷心希望这个高一级的政治会议能够顺利地召开，并且能够解决问题。我们一定要继续为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底。任何好战分子如果敢于利用政治会议来破坏停战并对政治会议加以破坏，他们必将遭受朝中人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的最坚决的反对而遭受更大的失败。
