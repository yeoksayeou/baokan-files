    The Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry convened a meeting of production deputy managers and key factory and mine directors from July 10th to 18th. The meeting summarized the central work of the iron and steel industry in the first half of the year and the completion of production plans. It also specifically analyzed and studied existing problems in enterprise management and deployed production work for the second half of the year. The meeting determined that the central task for production in the second half of the year for all factories and mines is to continue to thoroughly implement operational plans and production dispatch work, and to establish several major responsibility systems in a prepared and focused manner, in order to strive for the successful completion of the annual production plan.
    Since the beginning of this year, various factories and mines under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration have successively strengthened planning management, a new atmosphere has emerged. The production balance rate of many factories and mines has increased. For example, after the Tangshan Steel Plant's steelmaking department implemented the operational plan, the production balance rate in May increased from 95.5 percent to 97.7 percent. The production balance rate of the entire Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in the fourth week of May was 85 percent, and in the fourth week of June, it increased to 93.8 percent. On the basis of improved production balance rates, many factories and mines have completed national production plans. For example, the Xin Hu Steel Plant completed the monthly main product plan evenly from January to June. The Liguo Yi and Jinling Town iron mines in Shandong Province comprehensively completed the output, quality, and profit plans for the first half of the year. However, from the perspective of the entire Iron and Steel Industry Administration, the completion of production plans by various factories and mines in the first half of this year was still very poor. According to statistics, 33 percent of the factories and mines under the bureau failed to complete the total production value plan for the first half of the year. The main product plans of many key factories and mines were also not completed. Among them, products such as pig iron, open-hearth steel, electric furnace steel, and steel only completed 92 to 97.31 percent of the national plan. Because the plans were not completed well, it seriously affected the supply of iron and steel to basic construction units and the machinery manufacturing industry. The quality, cost, labor, and capital turnover plans of many factories and mines were also not completed well.
    The meeting made a specific analysis of the reasons why many factories and mines failed to complete production plans on time, pointing out that in the work of strengthening planning management, many factories and mines did not fully utilize the powerful tools of operational plans and dispatch work to seriously identify the key problems and weak links that disrupt operational plans, and did not take effective and timely measures to solve them one by one. Therefore, the operational plans and dispatch work of some factories and mines could not play a role in controlling and guiding production. Many factories and mines also lacked close coordination between major links such as production, supply, sales, maintenance, power, and transportation in the execution of operational plans. The meeting further pointed out that the main obstacle to the implementation of operational plans in various factories and mines is excessive equipment accidents. For example, the blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant had five nodule and hanging material accidents in the first half of this year, which not only reduced the output of pig iron, but also disrupted the operational plans for maintenance, transportation, supply, and sales. Because a certain blast furnace in the factory often had accidents, the average operating rate from January to May only reached 70 percent. The time spent on downtime repair due to accidents in the first quarter of a certain rolling mill of Benxi Iron and Steel Company accounted for 12.25 percent of the operating time. The operating rate of the open hearth furnace in Daye Steel Plant also only reached 69.49 percent.
    In light of this situation, the meeting required the leadership of various factories and mines to take active and effective measures in the second half of this year to ensure the completion of the national production plan. In terms of implementing operational plans and production dispatch work, all factories and mines must first take strong technical organizational measures to improve equipment maintenance and repair work, and revise and implement technical operating procedures and equipment maintenance procedures. Secondly, a set of systems for the compilation and inspection of operational plans and production dispatch work should be established from simple to complex. In terms of establishing a responsibility system, the meeting required all factories and mines to establish an equipment maintenance and repair responsibility system, a technical responsibility system, and an administrative responsibility system in a prepared and planned manner, so as to ensure the smooth execution of operational plans organizationally.
    The meeting finally called on the leaders at all levels of the factory and mining enterprises, in addition to seriously implementing the above-mentioned planning measures, to also attach great importance to the various positive factors and favorable conditions that have emerged within the enterprise in order to further improve the management level of the enterprise.

    钢铁工业管理局确定下半年工作重点
    贯彻作业计划和调度工作
    【新华社二十一日讯】中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业管理局在七月十日到十八日召开了所属各公司生产副经理和重点厂矿长会议。这次会议总结了今年上半年钢铁工业的中心工作和完成生产计划的情况，并具体分析和研究了目前企业管理工作中存在的问题，部署了下半年的生产工作。会议确定各厂矿下半年生产方面的中心工作是：继续深入贯彻作业计划与生产调度工作，有准备有重点地建立几种主要责任制，以争取胜利地完成全年生产计划。
    今年上半年，钢铁工业管理局所属各厂矿相继加强计划管理工作以来，已普遍出现了新的气象，不少厂矿的生产均衡率有了提高。如唐山钢厂炼钢部贯彻作业计划后，五月份生产的均衡率已由百分之九十五点五提高到百分之九十七点七。太原钢铁厂全厂五月份第四周的生产均衡率是百分之八十五，六月份第四周就提高到百分之九十三点八。不少厂矿在生产均衡率提高的基础上，完成了国家生产计划。如新沪钢铁厂一至六月份均衡地完成了每月的主要产品计划。山东利国驿、金岭镇两个铁矿全面地完成了上半年的产量、质量和利润计划。但是，从整个钢铁工业管理局范围来看，今年上半年各厂矿完成生产计划的情况还是非常不好的。据统计，全局所属的厂矿中，有百分之三十三的厂矿未能完成上半年的生产总值计划。不少重点厂矿的主要产品计划也未完成，其中生铁、平炉钢、电炉钢和钢材等产品只完成了国家计划的百分之九十二到百分之九十七点三一。因为计划完成得不好，就严重地影响了对基本建设单位和机械制造工业部门的钢铁供应。许多厂矿的质量、成本、劳动和资金周转等方面的计划也完成得不好。
    会议对许多厂矿不能按时完成生产计划的原因作了具体分析，指出不少厂矿在加强计划管理的工作中，由于没有充分利用作业计划和调度工作这一有力工具，认真找出打乱作业计划的关键问题和薄弱环节，而采取有效和及时的措施逐一加以解决，因此有些厂矿的作业计划和调度工作，不能起到控制与指导生产的作用。不少厂矿在执行作业计划中，在产、供、销、检修、动力和运输等主要环节之间，也还缺乏密切的配合。会议进一步指出：目前各厂矿贯彻作业计划中的主要障碍是设备事故过多。如石景山钢铁厂今年上半年高炉发生了五次结瘤和挂料事故，不但使生铁的产量减少，也打乱了检修、运输、供应和销售等方面的作业计划。该厂某号高炉由于经常发生事故，一至五月份的平均作业率就只达到百分之七十。本溪钢铁公司某轧钢机第一季因事故而停工修理的时间，就占到了作业时间的百分之十二点二五。大冶钢厂的平炉作业率也只达到百分之六十九点四九。
    根据这种情况，会议要求各厂矿的领导方面，在今年下半年要采取积极有效的措施，来保证完成国家的生产计划。在贯彻作业计划和生产调度工作方面，各厂矿首先要采取有力的技术组织措施，改善设备的维护检修工作，修改和贯彻技术操作规程和设备维护规程；其次要建立一套由简到繁的编制、检查作业计划的制度和生产调度工作的制度。在建立责任制度方面，会议要求各厂矿要有准备有计划地建立设备维护检修责任制、技术责任制和行政责任制，以便从组织上保证作业计划的顺利执行。
    会议最后号召各厂矿企业的各级领导干部，除认真执行上述计划措施外，还要十分重视目前企业内部出现的各种积极因素和有利条件，以进一步提高企业的管理水平。
