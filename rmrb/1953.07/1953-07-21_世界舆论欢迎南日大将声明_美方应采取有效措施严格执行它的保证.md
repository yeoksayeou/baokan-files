Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th – Our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, especially the statement issued by General Nam Il on the 19th, which have brought new hope for the early realization of a Korean armistice, have been widely welcomed around the world. News from various capitals around the world indicates that the firm efforts and sincere desire of the Korean-Chinese side have made the swift realization of a Korean armistice possible.

It is very meaningful to pay attention to the reactions of the capitals of capitalist countries. People in London regard General Nam Il's statement as "very satisfactory" news, Paris also welcomes the news, Indian officials in New Delhi expressed "great pleasure" at this "encouraging" news, and Australian Foreign Minister Casey also expressed "great welcome"... According to a Reuters reporter, the reason why the British are happy is because "they have always worried that if the armistice negotiations break down, the United States will exert strong pressure to intensify the war." Obviously, if this happens, the ones who will be unlucky are its "allies" that have been dragged into the war by the United States. The Reuters reporter also said that London diplomatic circles pointed out, "The United Nations has had to guarantee the Communists that South Korea will never act recklessly, but if the active cooperation of South Korea cannot be obtained in the implementation of the armistice details in the future, then this guarantee may still cause disputes in the future." London is "closely watching the reaction in the United States, especially because Dulles has denounced the guarantee to bring South Korea into line as simply absurd."

It is entirely understandable that people are paying attention to the attitude of the United States. According to news from Washington and New York, the reaction of the United States can be described as chaotic. Some expressed "fear has been reduced," while others expressed "extreme caution"... "The Daily Mirror" believes: "At present, the situation has not changed, it's just that Uncle Sam seems to be kneeling down and begging the North Koreans to sign something." Looking to the future, a reporter from the United Press, a mouthpiece of the U.S. State Department, sighed endlessly: "After just feeling happy, the policy advocated by the United States of continuing to expand armaments, establishing a European army, and taking a tough line against the Soviet Union is threatened with difficulties again... The Soviet Union's peace offensive has begun to reverse European public opinion, turning them against American foreign policy. This will almost certainly make it more difficult to establish a European army or hinder the proposal to hold talks between Churchill and Soviet Premier Malenkov himself. It will also make it more difficult to implement the plan to expand armaments." These signs indicate that the realization of a Korean armistice is not something that the U.S. ruling clique is willing to do, but only something they have to do under various difficulties and pressures. However, the United Press reporter in Panmunjom still tries to put on a brave face, saying that "the Communists have apparently completely succumbed to the strong demands made by the Allied forces on Thursday, so they accepted the Allied forces' guarantee." This shameless fabrication by the United Press reporter in Panmunjom, contrasted with the sighs of the New York "Daily Mirror" and the London United Press reporter, is very ridiculous.

Moreover, even in this situation, the United States has not completely changed its policy of appeasement towards Syngman Rhee. Although Harrison formally guaranteed at the Panmunjom conference table that "there is no time limit for the armistice" and guaranteed that the US side would abide by Article 62 of the armistice agreement, namely: "The provisions of this armistice agreement shall continue to be effective unless revised and supplemented with mutual consent or explicitly replaced by provisions in an appropriate agreement for a peaceful settlement at the political level between both sides," American news agencies today released the statement that "Harrison did not specifically state that South Korea's promise to abide by the armistice had no time limit." This means that Syngman Rhee can still disrupt the armistice ninety days after the political conference.

This can be confirmed by the Syngman Rhee gang. Just yesterday, after General Nam Il issued his statement, Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, declared that Syngman Rhee's attitude against the armistice "has not changed in essence." He said that the guarantee proposed by Harrison that South Korea would cooperate with the armistice indefinitely does not represent the attitude of the Syngman Rhee government. Pyun Yung-tai said that this guarantee made by Harrison is inconsistent with the agreement between Syngman Rhee and the US government. This agreement is: if the political conference after the armistice fails to enable Syngman Rhee to achieve his goal of "unifying Korea" within a certain time limit, the United States will withdraw from the political conference with Syngman Rhee. Pyun Yung-tai emphasized that the time limit for the political conference is equal to the time limit for Syngman Rhee not to obstruct the determination of the armistice. Pyun Yung-tai revealed that by then, Syngman Rhee would fabricate the lie that the Korean-Chinese side had "provoked" the South Korean troops, and then re-ignite the war under the pretext of so-called "defensive actions."

Pyun Yung-tai also said that South Korea refuses to allow the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and Indian troops to enter South Korea. At the same time, Syngman Rhee's adjutant declared yesterday that Syngman Rhee would never allow representatives from India, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to enter "any territory under Korean jurisdiction." Everyone knows that India, Poland, and Czechoslovakia will participate in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, responsible for guarding prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated. And representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia will also participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, going to ten designated ports in North and South Korea to carry out the duties of supervising the rotation of personnel, weapons, and equipment. Therefore, Pyun Yung-tai's words show that Syngman Rhee is not only attempting to sabotage the agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, but also attempting to make all the clauses related to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Article 13, Article 28, and Articles 36 to 50 of the draft armistice agreement unenforceable.

It can be seen from this that the Syngman Rhee group is still clamoring for non-compliance with the armistice agreement and is still attempting to sabotage the armistice.

Obviously, if the U.S. side continues to adopt a policy of appeasement towards Syngman Rhee and does not take effective measures to stop Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to sabotage the armistice, then Harrison's guarantees will all become empty words, and the Korean armistice will inevitably be sabotaged. Since the U.S. side has formally put forward these guarantees at the conference table, they should strictly implement these guarantees so that all the terms of the armistice agreement can be implemented. Otherwise, they will not be able to escape the responsibility of continuing to condone and encourage the Syngman Rhee group to sabotage the Korean armistice.

### 世界舆论欢迎南日大将声明  美方应采取有效措施严格执行它的保证

    世界舆论欢迎南日大将声明
    美方应采取有效措施严格执行它的保证
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者江南报道：为朝鲜停战早日实现带来新希望的朝中方面的努力，特别是南日大将十九日发表的声明，受到了全世界广泛的欢迎。来自世界各国首都的消息都指出，朝中方面的坚定努力和真诚的愿望使迅速实现朝鲜停战成为可能。
    人们注意一下资本主义各国首都的反应是很有意味的。伦敦人士把南日大将的声明看作是“令人非常满意的”消息，巴黎方面也欢迎这个消息，新德里的印度官方人士对这个“令人鼓舞的”消息表示“非常高兴”，澳大利亚外长卡希也表示“十分欢迎”……。据路透社记者说，英国人所以感到高兴，是因为“他们一直担心，如果停战谈判破裂，美国将加施强大压力来加紧战争”。很明显，如果这样，倒霉的是被美国拉下水的它的“盟国”。路透社记者还说，伦敦外交界人士指出，“联合国已不得不向共方保证南朝鲜绝不会妄动，但是如果将来实行停战细节时不能取得南朝鲜的积极合作，那末这担保性的立场日后可能还要引起纠纷”。伦敦方面“正密切注意美国国内的反应，尤其是因为杜勒斯曾斥责说，要南朝鲜就范的保证简直是荒谬的”。
    人们注意美国方面的态度是完全可以理解的。来自华盛顿和纽约的消息，美国方面的反应可以说是混乱不堪的。有的表示“恐惧心理已经减少”，有的表示“极其谨慎小心”……。“每日镜报”则认为：“在目前，局势是没有什么改变的，只是山姆大叔好像跪下来央求北朝鲜人签订什么东西。”美国国务院的喉舌合众社的记者在瞻望未来时又无限嗟叹：“在刚刚感到欢欣之后，美国所主张的继续扩充军备、建立欧洲军以及对苏联采取强硬路线的政策将遭受困难的威胁又出现了。……苏联的和平攻势已经开始扭转欧洲的舆论，使它们转而反对美国的外交政策。这样差不多肯定地将使建立欧洲军或阻挠实现邱吉尔要求和苏联总理马林科夫本人举行会谈的建议两事更加困难。它也将使实现扩张军备计划更加困难。”这些迹象表明，实现朝鲜停战并非美国统治集团甘心情愿，而只是在种种困难和压力下不得不这样做罢了。但是，板门店的合众社记者却还要勉强打肿脸充胖子，说什么“共方显然完全屈服于联军在星期四提出的强硬要求，因此他们接受联军的保证”。板门店合众社记者这种无耻的捏造，和纽约“每日镜报”与伦敦合众社记者的嗟叹对照起来，是非常令人可笑的。
    而且，即使这种情况下，美国仍然没有完全改变它对李承晚的纵容政策。尽管哈利逊在板门店的会议桌上正式保证“停战没有时间限制”，并且保证美方将遵守停战协定第六十二款，即：“本停战协定各条款，在未为双方共同接受的修正与增补，或未为双方政治级和平解决的适当协定中的规定所明确代替以前，继续有效”，美国的通讯社今天又放出空气说，“哈利逊并没有具体说明南朝鲜答应遵守停战并无时限”。这就是说，李承晚仍然可以在政治会议的九十天后破坏停战。
    这可以从李承晚匪帮方面得到证实。就在昨天南日大将发表声明以后，李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰就宣称，李承晚反对停战的态度“实质上是没有改变的”。他说，哈利逊所提出的南朝鲜将对停战无限期合作的保证，并不代表李承晚政府的态度。卞荣泰说，哈利逊所作的这个保证，是不符合于李承晚与美国政府间的协议的，这项协议是：如果停战以后的政治会议在一定时限之内不能使李承晚达到他“统一朝鲜”的目的，美国就和李承晚退出政治会议。卞荣泰强调说，政治会议的时限，等于李承晚不阻挠停战的确定时限。卞荣泰透露，到那时候，李承晚就要捏造朝中方面向南朝鲜部队“挑衅”的谎言，然后在所谓“采取防御行动”的藉口下重新挑起战争。
    卞荣泰还说，南朝鲜拒绝让中立国遣返委员会和印度军队进入南朝鲜。同时，李承晚的副官在昨天宣称，李承晚决不准印度、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克的代表进入“韩国管辖的任何领土”。大家知道，印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克将参加中立国遣返委员会，负责看管不直接遣返的战俘。而波兰与捷克斯洛伐克的代表还将参加中立国监察委员会，前往南北朝鲜的十个指定口岸执行监督人员、武器、装备轮换的职务。因此，卞荣泰的话表明了：李承晚不但企图破坏关于战俘遣返问题的协议，而且企图使停战协定草案第十三款、第二十八款以及从第三十六款到第五十款有关中立国监察委员会的条款全部无法实施。
    由此可见，李承晚集团仍然在叫嚣不遵守停战协定，仍然在企图破坏停战。
    很明显，如果美方对李承晚继续采取纵容的态度，不采取有效措施来制止李承晚的这种破坏停战的阴谋，那末哈利逊这些保证就都将成为空话，朝鲜停战将必然要遭到破坏。美方既然已经在会议桌上正式提出了这些保证，他们就应该严格执行这些保证，使停战协定条款全部得到实施。否则，他们就难逃继续纵容和鼓励李承晚集团破坏朝鲜停战的责任。
