Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th. The Soviet working class is supplying agricultural workers with a large number of new machines, increasing the degree of agricultural mechanization day by day. This is a guarantee of the continuous improvement of production in Soviet collective farms.

The development of Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing has been significant since the Second World War. In 1940, before the war, Soviet industry produced 84 types of agricultural machines and tools, but in 1950, it produced 222 types. Currently, the Soviet Union has 8,939 machine tractor stations, grassland improvement soil stations, and animal husbandry machine stations. Before the war, in 1938, the Soviet Union had 394,000 tractors and 153,500 combine harvesters. Now, the number of tractors in machine tractor stations and state farms has increased by 59% compared to pre-war levels, and the number of combine harvesters has increased by 51%. In the past year alone, the number of grain combine harvesters has increased by 10%, with self-propelled combine harvesters accounting for one-third. The performance of Soviet agricultural machines is also constantly improving. Currently, the Soviet tractor industry has almost completely transitioned to producing new tractors. They continuously supply Soviet agriculture with first-class crawler tractors, self-propelled combine harvesters, flax pullers, beet harvesters, and various other highly productive agricultural machines.

The Soviet "Agricultural Newspaper" published an interview with Stepanov, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Machine Manufacturing Industry, on the 22nd, discussing the production of new harvesting machines by Soviet agricultural machinery factories this year. Stepanov said: In terms of grain harvesting, all Soviet factories that used to manufacture "C-4" self-propelled combine harvesters have switched to producing self-propelled harvesters with screw-wheel linked cutters. This machine is of great help in harvesting tall and lodged grain. The Soviet Union has researched attachments for unloading grain while the harvester is moving and attachments for harvesting lodged grain. All attachments are required to increase the horsepower of the "C-4" self-propelled combine harvester. Harvesters with powerful engines are currently being tested. The Rostov Agricultural Machinery Factory has prepared to produce an improved "Stalin-8" linked harvester. A harvester suitable for humid and temperate zones is also being prepared for testing. This year, Soviet scientific research institutions and factory design departments jointly designed and tested several special devices for stacking and transporting haystacks, manufactured a new type of grain winnowing machine that can winnow 6,000 kilograms of grain per hour, and also produced and tested new grain drying machines and grain transporting machines. In addition, a supplementary winnowing device for the "Stalin-8" harvester was also manufactured. These new machines greatly improved the mechanization level of grain harvesting. The Soviet Union also began manufacturing a large number of stalk pressing attachments for sunflower harvesters this year. The corn harvesters produced this year can chop the stalks into fine grass while harvesting. Eight new machines for harvesting flax and ramie are being manufactured. Soviet workers also supply machine tractor stations and state farms with a large number of new cotton pickers. This machine is equipped with special attachments that can pick up the raw cotton that has fallen on the ground, thereby greatly reducing cotton losses. In addition, agricultural machinery manufacturing factories and scientific institutions in various regions are also testing and producing new machines for harvesting pasture, beets, and potatoes.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd. "Pravda" and "Izvestia" reported on the 20th that the "Friendship of Peoples" hydroelectric station, built on the shores of Lake Drisvyaty at the border of the three Soviet Union republics of Belarus, Lithuania, and Latvia, has been completed and held an inauguration ceremony on the 19th. This hydroelectric station will soon supply electricity to nearby collective farms, electrifying field work, livestock breeding, and agricultural product processing, as well as electrifying the family lives of farmers.

The "Friendship of Peoples" hydroelectric station is a crystallization of the friendly unity of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. The idea of building this hydroelectric station was proposed by collective farmers at the border of these three republics. Their purpose in building the hydroelectric station was to make their lives better and to consolidate the friendship between fraternal nationalities through joint labor. The Communist Parties and governments of the three republics warmly supported this initiative. When the construction of the "Friendship of Peoples" hydroelectric station began, people all over the Soviet Union provided various kinds of help and encouragement. People from all over the country wrote letters to local collective farmers, expressing their willingness to serve the construction project. A hydraulic technician from Moscow wrote: "Your construction moves me. If I can be of any use to the construction, I am willing to help you." A Ukrainian plasterer wrote in a letter: "I am a plasterer. If you need a plasterer, please write to me." Among the construction personnel of the hydroelectric station, there were many volunteer workers from all over the Soviet Union. Among them were workers from Leningrad, teachers from Lithuania, and scientific workers from Minsk, Vilnius, and Riga. Among the machines and building materials for the construction of the "Friendship of Peoples" hydroelectric station were new universal tractors sent by workers in Chelyabinsk, electric wires sent by workers in Moscow and Kiev, automatic dump trucks sent by workers in Minsk, and tractors sent by workers in Kharkov. In addition, there were generators sent by workers in Riga, electric motors sent by workers in Leningrad, cement sent by workers in Tallinn, fuel sent by workers in Baku, and cranes sent by workers in Dnepropetrovsk. The collective farmers near the construction site were also strong supporters of the hydroelectric station project. This spring, when floods were scouring the dam, collective farmers from Latvia, Lithuania, and Belarus in the vicinity actively helped to consolidate the dam and dig drainage ditches, persisting for several days and nights, so that the project could continue.

The inauguration ceremony held on the 19th became a demonstration of the friendly unity of Belarusians, Lithuanians, and Latvians. More than 20,000 people who participated in the ceremony congratulated each other on the victory of their joint labor and visited the hydroelectric station. At the meeting, Olga Sambra, a collective farmer from the Latvian Griva district and an active participant in the hydroelectric station project, said: "We sincerely thank the dear Communist Party and the Soviet government for their concern for the happiness of collective farmers. This truly people's building once again proves that the interests of us Latvians, Belarusians, Lithuanians, and all Soviet people are consistent, and our concerns are consistent. In the future, we will also use our united strength to strengthen national friendship and cherish this great fruit of the socialist revolution – the strength and powerful source of our multi-ethnic country."

    苏联农业机械化程度日益提高
    各种新式农业机器的数目迅速增加
    “民族友谊”水力发电站举行落成典礼
    【新华社莫斯科二十四日电】苏联工人阶级以大批新式机器供应农业工作者，使农业机械化程度日益提高，这是苏联集体农庄生产不断提高的保证。
    在第二次世界大战后，苏联农业机器制造的发展是很大的。苏联工业在战前一九四○年生产了八十四种农业机器和工具，但在一九五○年就生产了二百二十二种农业机器。现在，苏联有八千九百三十九个机器拖拉机站、草地改良土壤站和畜牧业机器站。在战前一九三八年，苏联有三十九万四千台拖拉机、十五万三千五百台收割联合机。现在，机器拖拉机站和国营农场的拖拉机的数目，已比战前增加了百分之五十九，收割联合机的数目增加了百分之五十一。过去一年来，谷物收割联合机就增加了百分之十，其中自动推进收割联合机占三分之一。苏联农业机器的性能也在不断提高着。现在，苏联的拖拉机工业差不多已经完全过渡到生产新式拖拉机。它们不断供应苏联农业以头等的履带拖拉机、自动推进收割联合机、收麻机、甜菜收割机以及其他各种生产力很大的农业机器。
    苏联“农业报”在二十二日刊载了苏联机器制造工业部副部长斯捷潘诺夫对记者发表的谈话，论述今年苏联各农业机器制造厂出产新式收割机器的情形。斯捷潘诺夫说：在收割谷物方面，苏联现在所有制造“C—4”式自动推进收割联合机的工厂，都改而出产有带螺丝轮联动机的割刀的自动推进收割机。这种机器对于收割长秆和倒伏的谷物有很大的帮助。苏联已研究出了收割机在走动时卸谷的附件和收割倒伏谷物的附件。所有附件都要求增加
    “C—4”式自动推进收割机的马力。现在正在检验出产带有强大马力的发动机的收割机。罗斯托夫农业机器制造厂已准备生产改进了构造的“斯大林—八”式连挂收割机。准备试验的还有适宜于潮温地带使用的收割机。今年苏联科学研究机关和各工厂的设计处，共同设计并试验了几种堆谷草和运草堆的特殊设备，制造了一种每小时可以簸谷六千公斤的新式簸谷机，还出产和试验了新式的烘谷机、运谷机。此外，还制造了“斯大林—八”式收割机上用的补充簸谷器。这些新式机器大大提高了收割谷物的机械化水平。苏联今年还开始制造大批向日葵收割机上用的压秆的附件。今年生产的玉蜀黍收割机，能在收割同时把秆茎切碎成细草。有八种新式的收割亚麻和苎麻的机器正在制造着。苏联工人还供给机器拖拉机站和国营农场大批新式采棉机。这种机器装置着特设的附件，能够拣拾落在地上的原棉，因而大大减少棉花的损失。此外，各地农业机器制造工厂和科学机关还在试验并生产收割牧草、甜菜、马铃薯的新机器。
    【新华社莫斯科二十二日电】“真理报”和“消息报”二十日报道，建立在白俄罗斯、立陶宛和拉脱维亚三个苏联加盟共和国交界处德里斯维亚蒂湖畔的“民族友谊”水电站，已经竣工，并在十九日举行了落成典礼。这个水电站即将以电力供应附近的集体农庄，使田间工作、牲畜饲养和农产品加工工作实行电气化，并使农民的家庭生活电气化。
        “民族友谊”水电站是苏联各民族友好团结的一个结晶。建筑这个水电站的意见，是由这三个共和国交界处的集体农民提出来的。他们兴建水电站的目的，就是想使生活过得更加美满，想以共同的劳动来巩固兄弟民族之间的友谊。三个加盟共和国的共产党和政府热烈地支持了这个倡议。当“民族友谊”水电站开始建筑的时候，苏联全国各地人民都给了各种帮助和鼓励。各地人民都写信给当地的集体农民，表示愿为这个建筑工程服务。莫斯科一个水力技术人员去信说：“你们的建筑使我感动。如果我对于建筑有益处的话，我愿意去帮助你们。”乌克兰一个泥水工人在信中写道：“我是一个泥水匠。如果你们需要泥水匠，请写信告诉我。”在水电站建筑人员中，有许多来自全苏各地的志愿工作者。其中有列宁格勒的工人，有立陶宛的教员，有明斯克、维尔那和里加的科学工作者。在建筑“民族友谊”水电站的机器和建筑材料中，有车里雅宾斯克工人送来的新式万能拖拉机器，有莫斯科和基辅工人送来的电线，有明斯克工人送来的自动卸货卡车，有哈尔科夫工人送来的拖拉机。此外还有里加工人送来的发电机、列宁格勒工人送来的电动机、塔林工人送来的水泥、巴库工人送来的燃料、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克工人送来的起重机。工地附近的集体农民也是水电站工程的有力的支持者。今年春天，当洪水冲刷着堤坝的时候，当地附近的拉脱维亚、立陶宛、白俄罗斯的集体农民，便积极地帮助巩固堤坝、开排水渠，坚持了几个昼夜，使工程得以继续进行。
    十九日举行的水电站落成典礼，成了白俄罗斯人、立陶宛人、拉脱维亚人的友好团结的示威。参加典礼的两万多人彼此祝贺了共同劳动的胜利，并参观了水电站。会上，水电站工程的积极参加者、拉脱维亚格里夫区集体农妇奥尔加·桑布拉说：“我们衷心感谢亲爱的共产党和苏维埃政府对集体农民幸福的关怀。这个真正人民的建筑物再一次证明：我们拉脱维亚人、白俄罗斯人、立陶宛人以及所有苏联人的利益是一致的，关心是一致的。我们今后还要用一致的力量来加强民族的友谊，爱护这个社会主义革命的伟大的果实——我们多民族国家力量和强大的源泉。”
