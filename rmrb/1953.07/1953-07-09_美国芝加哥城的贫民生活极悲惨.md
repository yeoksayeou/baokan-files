Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th: The Chicago "Daily News" recently published some reports about the slums of Chicago, revealing the tragic scenes in the impoverished residential areas of this, the second largest city in the United States.

The investigations by the newspaper's reporters reflect that in the 23 square miles of slums in Chicago, living and sanitary conditions are extremely poor, and the municipal authorities simply do not care about this situation. In those areas, houses that were originally intended to accommodate only 200 people now have 1,000 people crammed into them. The dilapidated condition of these houses can be seen from the comparison of a slum house photo and a house destroyed by a hurricane, published side-by-side by the Chicago "Daily News." It is almost impossible to distinguish in the photos which is the slum house and which is the one destroyed by the hurricane.

The internal conditions of the slum houses are even more intolerable. There are as many as 10,000 complaints from slum residents regarding rats and other unsanitary conditions, which are just gathering dust in the files of the Chicago Municipal Authorities' Housing Committee. In the past six months, there have been 57 recorded cases of rat bites. In two houses that look like "abandoned coal bunkers," a family of four lives amidst sloping stairs, collapsing ceilings, and leaky toilets. One child was nicknamed "Pig Face" because rats bit off his nose. Three months ago, in another slum family, a nine-month-old girl was bitten to death by rats.

The lives of the people living in the slums are already extremely miserable, but they also suffer from the ruthless exploitation of landlords. For example, a landlord divided what was originally a single-family apartment into three units and rented them to three families. The landlord's monthly rental income has increased fivefold since 1942. The landlords never care about the suffering of the tenants. They refuse to spend money to repair the dilapidated houses that may collapse at any time. One landlord boasted proudly about his exploitative income, saying that whoever bought his house could recoup the investment in four years because "in fact, you never have to spend any money on repairs."

Although the Chicago city government has a housing committee, in the words of the Chicago "Daily News" reporter, it is "filled with do-nothing political opportunists." They are meal ticket officials dispatched by the ruling party, and they never consider the living conditions of the slum residents.

### 美国芝加哥城的贫民生活极悲惨

    美国芝加哥城的贫民生活极悲惨
    【新华社八日讯】纽约消息：芝加哥“每日新闻”不久以前发表关于芝加哥贫民窟的一些报道，透露出这个美国第二大城市中穷苦人民居住区中的悲惨景象。
    该报记者的调查反映出，在芝加哥广达二十三平方哩的贫民区中，居住及卫生条件极端恶劣，而市政当局对这种情形根本不加过问。在那些地区里，原来只能住二百人的房屋，现在有一千人挤在里面。这些房屋的破烂程度，从芝加哥“每日新闻”并排刊登出来的一所贫民窟房屋的照片和一所被飓风毁坏的房屋的照片对照中可以看出，照片中简直区别不出那一所是贫民窟的房子而另一所是被飓风所摧毁了的。
    贫民窟房屋的内部状况更加不可容忍。仅仅压在芝加哥市政当局的房屋委员会档案里的贫民窟居民有关老鼠及其他不卫生的情况的申诉，就有一万件之多。在最近半年中，发生的老鼠咬人的事件，有记录可查的就有五十七件。在两间看来像“废弃不用的煤仓”一样的房屋，在倾斜的楼梯、陷落的天花板和漏水的马桶之间住着四口人的一家。一个孩子被加上了“猪脸”的绰号，因为老鼠咬掉了他的鼻子。三个月以前，在另一贫民家庭中，一个九个月的女孩被老鼠咬死了。
    住在贫民窟里的人们的生活已经极端恶劣，但还要遭受房主们的残酷剥削。举例说，一个房主把原来是一家住的所谓公寓房间分隔成三个单位，租给三家人住，这个房主每月租金的收入自从一九四二年以来已增加了五倍。房主们从来不顾住户的疾苦死活，他们拒绝出钱来修理已经破烂不堪，随时可能倾塌的房屋。一个房主曾得意地夸耀他的剥削收入说，谁要买了他的房子，四年就可以翻本，因为“事实上从来不用花任何钱来进行修理”。
    芝加哥市政府虽然有个房屋委员会，但用芝加哥“每日新闻”记者的话，却只是“充斥着不做事的政治夤缘者”，他们是执政党委派的吃饭官，从不考虑贫民窟居民的居住情况。
