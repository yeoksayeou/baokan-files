Xinhua News Agency, July 18th:

    Typical pilot work to create experience for the universal development of basic-level elections across the country is progressing smoothly.

    This large-scale basic-level election pilot work began in early May and has been launched successively in thousands of rural areas, streets, and factories in forty-two provinces and cities across the country. From the Heilongjiang border north of 48 degrees north latitude to Hainan Island, which enjoys year-round southern scenery; from the sparsely populated pastoral areas of Xinjiang Province to the densely populated provinces on the southeast coast, the vast majority of people are participating with excitement in their first election as masters of their own affairs. In the Northeast region, where the work started earlier, all provinces and cities except Rehe Province have completed the pilot work for universal suffrage. In Sichuan Province, the typical pilot work in more than 140 townships and urban districts has also basically ended. In Zhejiang Province, most of the townships where counties are conducting pilot basic-level elections have entered the stage of electing people's representatives and preparing to convene people's congresses in early July. The majority of the pilot areas in the remaining East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest provinces are reviewing voter qualifications, deliberating on representative candidates, and convening election meetings. In Shanxi and Hebei provinces in the North China region, where the progress of the pilot universal suffrage has been slower due to township divisions, propaganda for universal suffrage is currently underway, with population surveys and voter registration beginning.

    When the good news of universal suffrage reached these pilot areas, people were overjoyed and welcomed this great political movement with the same enthusiasm as celebrating a happy event. When the Beijing Municipal Universal Suffrage Work Team arrived at the various pilot sites, the masses came forward to ask them various questions and give their opinions, and many citizens voluntarily purchased relevant universal suffrage documents for study. Many citizens in Shanghai helped the universal suffrage workers, and some factories even held grand celebration meetings when issuing voter certificates. In more than 200 pilot townships in 24 counties including Ruijin and Xingguo, old revolutionary base areas in Jiangxi Province, the masses voluntarily participated in various small-scale report meetings and forums to discuss the significance of universal suffrage. When the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in Tantou Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, met to discuss universal suffrage, more than 150 opinions from the masses regarding universal suffrage were submitted to the conference for discussion. The township election committee also successively received more than 40 letters from the people reporting counter-revolutionaries and offering opinions to cadres.

    "Step up production and welcome universal suffrage!" This is the fighting slogan put forward by workers in various places to show their high political enthusiasm. Many factory workers participating in the pilot universal suffrage work are throwing themselves into a surge of production competitions to welcome universal suffrage. After being educated in the pilot universal suffrage work, the workers of Shenyang Chemical Plant generally improved their production enthusiasm. The daily output of Workshop 514 of the plant increased by more than 30% in less than a week after the pilot universal suffrage began. In order to welcome universal suffrage, the female workers of the Shanghai Private Zhicheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory voluntarily proposed to consciously abide by labor discipline and improve quality. Since the pilot universal suffrage work began in June, the factory's substandard cloth rate has dropped from 2.94% in May to 2.25%. More than 50 groups in Tianjin People's Printing Factory put forward conditions for welcoming universal suffrage with practical actions. Workers in the steel wire, drawing frame, and roving workshops of Beiyang Yarn Factory have enthusiastically launched a competition to welcome universal suffrage.

    In the areas where the typical pilot basic-level elections are being conducted, voters are enthusiastically participating in the election activities. From the number of voters participating in the elections in various places, it can be seen that the people attach great importance to and care about their democratic rights. According to statistics from 20 pilot townships in 12 counties of 7 provinces, the number of voters participating in the elections averaged 80.9% of the total number of voters. In Changshan Township, Lushan Township in Fuyang County, and Dong'an Township in Hang County, Zhejiang Province, more than 95% of the voters participated in the elections. The day of the election meeting was as lively as a festival everywhere. Voters dressed neatly, with voter certificates and red flowers pinned to their chests, and entered the venue with gongs and drums. In ethnic minority areas, women of all ethnic groups wore their own national costumes to attend the election meeting. At the election meeting held in the Second District of Jinan City, Shandong Province, Chao Zhefu and Liu Minsheng, vice chairmen of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, personally attended and voted. Li Puyun, a voter from Erxian Street election district of the city, who had gone to Beijing on business, sent back his voter certificate and a list of the three representatives he agreed with from Beijing on the day of the election. In Bu Jiapeng Township, Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, more than 50 voters who were away from home voluntarily rushed back to participate in the election on the day the election meeting was held. Many women in labor were unwilling to give up their right to vote. The chairman of the election committee and the vote counter of Lishan Ding election district in Jinan City personally delivered the ballot box to the women in labor, so that all eight women in labor who could not go out in the entire election district cast their votes.

    The voters in the various pilot election areas attached great importance to their glorious electoral rights. They repeatedly deliberated and discussed the representative candidates, and carefully selected the people they were most satisfied with to be representatives. After the list of representative candidates was put forward, the voters in the Fudong Street election district of the Second District of Jinan City conducted extensive visits and investigations, introducing each other's situations. Some housewives personally ran out to inquire about the conditions of the representative candidates in their spare time from their busy housework. Liu Bolin, a voter in the Xiandong Lane election district of the district, initially supported Ma Biao from this lane as a representative candidate, but later heard that Wang Guilai, a tricycle worker proposed by the Nanbeicang Lane, had better conditions than Ma Biao. He personally went to inquire about Wang Guilai from people who knew his situation, and finally agreed to elect Wang Guilai as a representative. After the list of 56 candidates in Peijiaying Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, was determined, the voter groups spent two or three nights evaluating and comparing the candidates in their own election districts, and finally selected the people they thought were the most satisfactory. Xiong Yanqing, the director of the representative of Yakou Village, Shuanglong Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, was active and responsible in his work, but had the shortcoming of being rude in his attitude. In this election, he voluntarily reviewed himself to the masses, and the masses expressed their satisfaction, saying: If there are shortcomings as long as they can be changed, we will still elect him. As a result, the majority of voters agreed to have him as a candidate again.

    In the elections, voters gave great trust to model Communist Party members, basic-level cadres, and labor models and other outstanding figures. In the five pilot townships in Sichuan Province that completed the basic-level elections, the original basic-level cadres elected as representatives accounted for 80% of the total number of representatives. Among the 31 representatives elected in Shanxi Township, Feixi County, Anhui Province, there were 9 Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Ma Guangtian, the model cadre of Chengshi Village, a model production village in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, was nominated as the first candidate in the village election district, and 100% of the voters voted for him. Li Kaizhen, the provincial agricultural labor model of Nanlong Township, Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, was elected as a people's representative of the township with the most votes. In Nianpan Township, Nanjiang County, Sichuan Province, an old revolutionary base area on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, the Red Army martyrs, family members of soldiers, and old Red Army and guerrilla fighters who were loved by the people accounted for one-third of the representatives elected in the entire township. Dai Guanggui, the chairman of the district Soviet who persisted in the revolutionary struggle in the most difficult environment and actively led the masses in production after liberation, and Yang Taixiang, who had served as a Red Army guerrilla fighter, were both elected as people's representatives. Women also accounted for a certain proportion of the representatives elected in various places. The women representatives elected in Hebei Township, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, accounted for more than 21% of the total number of representatives. In ethnic minority mixed areas, the quota of representatives included outstanding figures from all ethnic groups. In Chenliang Township, a mixed ethnic minority area in Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, the Buyi, Han, and Miao ethnic groups participating in the election all had their own representatives elected according to the population ratio of each ethnic group. In addition, many outstanding teachers, doctors, progressive industrialists and businessmen, and religious figures were also elected as people's representatives. These people who are supported by the people are carrying out the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the masses with great enthusiasm.

    A new atmosphere has emerged in the areas that have undergone universal suffrage. Many newly elected people's representatives are leading the masses in production and construction with unparalleled enthusiasm. At the first township people's congress held in Yufeng Township, Suining County, Sichuan Province, after the universal suffrage, according to the opinions of the masses, the meeting focused on discussing the production issues that the people of the township were most concerned about, and decided to focus on leading the masses in drought resistance and water conservation as the main work for the next two months. The meeting also approved the pond repair plan proposed by People's Representative Dai Haicheng. After the universal suffrage, the cadres of Yuenan Township, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, generally improved their enthusiasm for work. They went deep into the masses to organize temporary mutual aid groups, and the entire township's summer harvest was completed in four days. In Hebei Township, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, a moving example of people's representatives leading the masses to protect dikes appeared. People's Representative Li Tiancheng used his shoulders and chest to hold up the dike that was about to be washed away by the flood, and led the people of the entire village to persist in the dike protection struggle for three days and nights, finally defeating the flood and protecting the rice fields of the entire village.

    各地农村、街道和工厂的基点展开基层选举试办工作
    【新华社十八日讯】全国各地为普遍开展基层选举创造经验的典型试办工作，正在顺利地进展中。
    这个规模宏大的基层选举试办工作，是从五月初开始在我国四十二个省、市的数千个农村、街道和工厂的基点里先后展开的。从北纬四十八度以北的黑龙江边到终年是南国风光的海南岛；从新疆省地广人稀的畜牧区到东南海岸人口稠密的各省，广大人民都以兴奋的心情参加他们有生以来第一次当家作主的选举活动。工作开始较早的东北区，目前除热河省外，其余各省、市都已结束了普选试办工作，四川省的一百四十多个乡、镇和市辖区的典型试办工作也已基本结束。浙江省各县进行基层选举典型试办的乡、镇，大部分在七月初已进入选举人民代表、准备召开人民代表大会的阶段。其余华东、中南、西南、西北各省的大部分试办地区，正在审查选民资格、酝酿代表候选人和召开选举大会。在由于划乡而使普选试办进展较迟的华北区山西、河北等省，目前正在进行普选宣传，开始人口调查和选民登记。
    当实行普选的喜讯传到了这些试办地区以后，人们都为此而欢欣鼓舞，他们用办喜事一样的心情来迎接这个伟大的政治运动。北京市的普选工作队到达各试办基点时，群众就纷纷前来向他们提出各种问题和意见，很多市民自动购买有关普选的文件进行学习。上海市许多市民帮助普选工作人员进行工作，有的工厂在颁发选民证时还举行了隆重的庆祝大会。江西省革命老根据地瑞金、兴国等二十四个县的二百多个试办乡、镇中，群众都自动参加了各种小型报告会、座谈会，讨论普选的意义。在山东省历城县滩头乡各界人民代表会议开会讨论普选时，有一百五十多条群众提出的有关普选的意见送交大会讨论。乡选举委员会还陆续收到四十多封检举反革命分子和给干部提意见的人民来信。
    “加紧生产，迎接普选！”这是表现出各地工人们为表现他们高度的政治热情而提出的战斗口号。许多参加普选试办工作的工厂职工，正在投入迎接普选的生产竞赛的热潮。沈阳化工厂的工人在普选试办工作中受到教育后，生产积极性普遍提高，该厂五一四车间在开始试办普选后，不到一周时间内，日产量提高了百分之三十以上。上海私营志成染织厂的女工们为了迎接普选，自动提出要自觉地遵守劳动纪律，提高质量。从六月份开始普选试办工作后，全厂次布率已由五月份的百分之二点九四降低到百分之二点二五。天津人民印刷厂有五十多个小组提出了以实际行动迎接普选的条件。北洋纱厂钢丝、并条、粗纱等车间的工人，已热烈地展开了迎接普选的竞赛。
    在进行基层选举典型试办的地区，选民们踊跃地参加了选举活动。从各地参加选举的选民人数中，可以看出人民对于自己的民主权利的重视和关心。根据七个省十二个县二十个试办乡、镇的统计，选民参加选举的人数平均占选民总数的百分之八十点九。浙江省富阳县长山乡、鹿山乡和杭县的东安乡，百分之九十五以上的选民都参加了选举。各地在举行选举大会那一天，都像节日一样的热闹，选民们穿戴得齐齐整整，把选民证和红花配在胸前，敲锣打鼓走进会场。在少数民族地区，各族妇女都穿着本民族的盛装，去参加选举大会。在山东省济南市第二区所举行的选举大会上，山东省人民政府副主席晁哲甫、刘民生等都亲自到会投票。该市二贤街选区因事到北京的选民李普云，在选举那天，准时地从北京寄回他的选民证和他同意的三位代表的名单。浙江省寿昌县卜家蓬乡，有五十多个外出的选民，他们在举行选举大会那天，都自动赶回来参加选举。许多产妇都不愿放弃自己的选举权利，济南市历山顶选区选举委员会主席和检票人，亲自把票箱送到产妇面前，使全选区八个不能出门的产妇都投了票。
    各试办选举地区的选民们十分重视自己的光荣的选举权利，他们反复地酝酿、讨论代表候选人，认真地挑选自己最满意的人当代表。济南市第二区府东大街选区的选民，在代表候选人名单提出后，广泛地进行访问和调查，互相介绍情况，有的家庭主妇在繁忙的家务之暇，还亲自跑出去打听代表候选人的条件。该区县东巷选民刘柏霖，开始时赞成本巷的马标当代表候选人，后来听说南北仓巷提出的三轮车工人王贵来比马标的条件还好，他便亲自去打听了解王贵来情况的人，最后同意选举王贵来当代表。山东省历城县裴家营乡的五十六名候选人名单确定后，各选民小组用了两三个晚上的时间，把本选区的候选人评了又评，比了又比，最后选定了他们认为是最满意的人。四川省江津县双龙乡垭口村代表主任熊焱清，工作积极负责，但有态度生硬的缺点，在这次选举中，他自动向群众检讨，群众表示满意，他们说：有缺点只要能改，我们还是要选他。结果，大多数选民又同意他当候选人。
    在选举中，选民们对模范的共产党员、基层干部和劳动模范等优秀人物付予极大的信任。四川省完成基层选举的五个试办乡中，原有的基层干部当选为代表的占代表总数百分之八十。安徽省肥西县山西乡当选的三十一名代表中，有共产党员、青年团员九人。黑龙江省海伦县丰产模范村——诚实村的模范干部马广田，被提名为该村选区第一个候选人，百分之百的选民投了他的票。四川省南部县南隆乡的省农业劳动模范李开珍，以最多的票数当选为乡的人民代表。在川陕边革命老根据地四川省南江县碾盘乡，受人民爱戴的红军烈士、军人家属和红军、游击队的老战士，当选为代表的占全乡代表的三分之一。曾在最困难的环境下坚持过革命斗争，解放后又积极领导群众生产的区苏维埃主席戴光贵和作过红军游击队员的杨太祥，都被选为人民代表。各地所选出的代表中，妇女也占有一定的比例。江苏省江宁县河北乡当选的妇女代表占代表总数的百分之二十一强。在民族杂居区，代表名额中包括了各族人民的优秀人物。贵州省贵筑县民族杂居区陈亮乡，参加选举的布依族、汉族和苗族按各民族的人口比例，都有自己的代表当选。此外，许多优秀的教师、医生以及进步的工商业者、宗教界人士也被选为人民代表。这些为人民所拥戴的人，正以高度的热情去执行群众交给他们的光荣任务。
    在经过普选的地区，一种新的气象已显现出来。许多新选的人民代表以无比的热情，领导群众进行生产建设。四川省遂宁县玉峰乡在举行普选后的第
    一次乡人民代表大会上，根据群众的意见，着重讨论了全乡人民最关心的生产问题，决定以领导群众进行抗旱保水为今后两个月的主要工作，大会还批准了人民代表戴海成提出的修塘计划。江苏省太仓县岳南乡的干部，普选后普遍提高了工作积极性，他们深入群众组织临时互助组，全乡夏收工作四天内就全部完成。江苏省江宁县河北乡，还出现了人民代表领导群众保护圩堤的动人事例。人民代表李天成用肩头和胸口抵住将被洪水冲垮的堤岸，领导全村人民坚持三昼夜的护堤斗争，终于战胜了洪水，保住全村的稻田。
