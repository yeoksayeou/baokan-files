    Heighten Revolutionary Vigilance!
    —Summary of the Pravda Editorial on the 15th

    In recent days, Party committee plenary sessions with the participation of Party activists, meetings of Party grassroots organizations, and mass rallies of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals have been held across the Soviet Union. The Party committee plenary sessions and laboring people's rallies discussed the decisions of the Central Committee plenary session of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes. The Communists and all working people of the Soviet Union angrily condemned this hireling of international imperialism and declared their full and wholehearted support for the policies of the Party and the Soviet government.

    The Party organizations and the laboring people holding these meetings to discuss this issue clearly demonstrate that the Party and all the Soviet people are drawing political lessons from the Beria affair and making the necessary conclusions to guide their future activities in the construction of communism.

    One of the main conclusions is that in all work of the Party and the Soviets, in all sectors of communist construction, and under all circumstances, it is necessary to use all methods to heighten the revolutionary vigilance of Communists and all working people. Because capitalist encirclement exists, the Soviet people must strive to heighten their vigilance. The more victoriously we advance, the more furious the international reactionaries become. They are constantly trying to hinder the Soviet Union's victorious communist construction and will not hesitate to use any means to do so. The entire history of the Soviet state and the current international situation can prove this.

    The characteristic of the current international situation is: on the one hand, the continuous rise of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, and on the other hand, the weakening of the imperialist camp. Our Soviet motherland is filled with indestructible strength and creativity, confidently advancing along the road of building communism. The people's democratic countries are making increasingly significant achievements in building socialism. The new peace initiatives proposed by the Soviet government have further strengthened the Soviet Union's international position, increased our prestige, and greatly boosted the worldwide movement to defend and consolidate peace. The workers' movements in many capitalist countries are expanding and growing. The scale of the national liberation movement in colonies and dependencies is growing larger. All these facts arouse extreme fear in the imperialists, making the reactionary imperialist forces become greatly rampant. They are taking the most extreme and sharp means of struggle to undermine the international peace, democracy, and socialist camp, especially the leadership force of this camp—the Soviet Union's growing power. Capitalist countries are conducting a frenzied arms expansion, engaging in military adventures, attempting to strengthen pressure on the Soviet Union, plotting all possible provocations and subversive activities in democratic countries, and openly, but mainly secretly, spending billions of dollars to carry out these activities.

    The enemies of peace, democracy, and socialism do not and cannot have any mass social base in our country. Their only gamble is on spies and saboteurs sent to our country from abroad, various degenerates, and all kinds of politically and morally corrupt elements.

    Capitalist encirclement still exists. It is still very rampant. It is sending agents to infiltrate our ranks. It is constantly looking for people willing to sell out the interests of the motherland and carry out the tasks assigned to them by the imperialists to undermine Soviet society. It would be a serious neglect of the main principles of Marxism-Leninism if we do not take this fact into account.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the leading force in Soviet society. The Party's leadership is a decisive condition for the consolidation and invincibility of the Soviet system. The Party is trusted, supported, respected, and loved without limit by all the working people of our country. The people believe that the policies formulated by the Party over many years are in line with their vital interests, and they spare no effort to implement these policies. However, this unique position of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union also has its downside. We often forget that enemies who skillfully disguise themselves as Communists have managed and will manage to infiltrate the Party, carrying out subversive activities for their ambitious goals and their hostile aims, and executing the orders of imperialist countries and their intelligence agencies. This is the lesson of the Beria affair, an agent of international imperialism exposed by the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU. Beria, who had lost the qualities of a Communist and had become a bourgeois degenerate, attempted to seize the leadership of the Party and the state for the benefit of foreign capital in order to destroy our Communist Party and replace the policies formulated by the Party over many years with a policy of surrender that would ultimately lead to the restoration of capitalism. Initially, Beria cleverly disguised and concealed his activities. Beria became arrogant and domineering just as the enemies of the Soviet state abroad intensified all their anti-Soviet subversive activities.

    Therefore, Beria's exposure once again proves an indisputable point: if one end of the anti-Soviet line of hostile activity is found in the Soviet Union, then the other end must be found in the capitalist countries that surround us. Therefore, the conclusion is: we must always prepare our weapons to deal with capitalist encirclement, and we must tirelessly increase our revolutionary vigilance.

    To make every effort to heighten our revolutionary vigilance and eliminate paralysis and credulity in our ranks, it is necessary to resolutely improve all work of the Party. This means strictly observing the leadership principles and norms of Party life formulated by the Party, especially the principle of collective leadership.

    The work of all organizations and departments must be placed under the regular and constant supervision of the Party. In selecting cadres, we must resolutely abandon all narrow utilitarian methods and strictly adhere to the Party's principle of selecting cadres according to the standards of political quality and professional ability.

    It is particularly important to constantly strengthen and expand the ties between the Party and the masses, pay attention to listening to the demands of the working people, and constantly strive to improve the living standards of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals—all the Soviet people. We must unfold self-criticism, especially criticism from below, with greater determination and courage. We must enable the broad masses of working people to expose shortcomings and unhealthy phenomena themselves and propose ways to eliminate them.

    The work of educating Communists and all the working people in a spirit of high revolutionary vigilance is not a temporary and short-term task, but a matter that the entire Party and all Party organizations must always be concerned about. Do not ignore the fact that although the exploiting classes have been eliminated in our country, capitalist remnants have not been eradicated from people's minds. At the same time, there are serious shortcomings in the Party's propaganda work and political education work among the masses. Our task is to eliminate the shortcomings so that our propaganda work and political work among the masses can educate Communists and all the people in a spirit of believing in the invincibility of the communist cause and in infinite loyalty to the Party and the socialist motherland.

    Revolutionary vigilance is our weapon against all enemies. If we always sharpen this weapon and are ready to take action at any time, then all the enemies' conspiracies will certainly be defeated.

    Heighten the revolutionary vigilance of Communists and all working people!

    提高革命警惕！
    ——“真理报”十五日社论的摘要
    这几天来，苏联全国各地纷纷举行有党的活动分子参加的党委会全体会议、党的基层组织的会议和工人、集体农民、知识分子的群众大会。党委员会的全体会议和劳动人民的集会，讨论了苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚的反党、反国家的罪行的决定。苏联的共产党员和全体劳动人民，愤怒地谴责国际帝国主义的这个雇佣分子，并宣布他们充分地、全心全意地拥护党和苏维埃政府的政策。
    党组织和劳动人民举行大会讨论这个问题，清楚地证明了，党和全体苏维埃人民正在从贝利亚事件中吸取政治教训，并作出必要的结论，以指导他们今后在共产主义建设中的活动。
    主要的结论之一是：在党和苏维埃的一切工作中，在共产主义建设的各个部门，在一切环境下，必须用一切方法提高共产党员和全体劳动人民的革命警惕。因为有资本主义包围存在，所以苏联人民必须竭力提高警惕。我们越是胜利地前进，国际反动派就越气愤，他们不断力图阻挠苏联的胜利的共产主义建设，并为此不惜使用任何手段。苏维埃国家的全部历史和目前的国际局势可以证明这一点。
    目前国际局势的特点是：一方面是和平、民主和社会主义力量的不断高涨，另一方面是帝国主义阵营力量的削弱。我们苏维埃祖国充满着不可摧毁的力量和创造力，满怀信心地沿着建设共产主义的道路前进。各人民民主国家在建设社会主义方面正取得日新月异的成就。苏联政府提出的新的和平倡议，使得苏联的国际地位进一步加强，使得我国的威信有了提高，使得全世界保卫和巩固和平的运动大大高涨。许多资本主义国家内的工人运动正在扩大和增长中。殖民地和附属国的民族解放运动的规模愈来愈大。所有这一切事实引起帝国主义的极度的恐惧，使得反动的帝国主义力量大大猖狂起来。他们采取最极端、最尖锐的斗争手段，来破坏国际和平、民主和社会主义阵营，首先是这个阵营的领导力量——苏联的日益增长的力量。资本主义国家正在进行疯狂的军备扩张，进行军事冒险，企图加强对苏联的压力，在民主阵营各国策划一切可能的挑衅和颠覆活动，公开地、而主要是秘密地花费许多亿美元，来进行这种活动。
    和平、民主和社会主义的敌人，在我们国内没有也不可能有任何群众性的社会基础。他们仅有的赌本就是从外面派到我国来的间谍和破坏分子，各种蜕化分子以及各种政治上和道德上腐化的分子。
    资本主义的包围仍然存在，它还是非常猖狂，它正在派遣特务混入我们内部，它经常在物色愿意出卖祖国利益、并执行帝国主义者交给他们的破坏苏维埃社会的任务的人们，如果不考虑到这一事实，那就是严重地忽视马克思列宁主义的主要原则。
    苏联共产党是苏联社会的领导力量。党的领导是苏维埃制度的巩固和不可战胜性的有决定意义的条件。党受到我国全体劳动人民的无限信任和拥护、尊敬和爱戴。人民认为党在许多年中所制订出来的政策，是符合他们切身利益的，他们不遗余力地来执行这种政策。但是，苏联共产党的这种独一无二的地位，也有它不利的一面。我们常常忘记了巧妙地装扮成共产党员的敌人已经设法并且将要设法混到党内来，为了他们野心家的目的和他们的敌对的目的，而执行帝国主义国家及其情报机关的命令，从事颠覆活动。这就是被苏共中央主席团揭露了的国际帝国主义代理人贝利亚事件的教训。已经丧失了共产党员品质、并已变成资产阶级蜕化分子的贝利亚，为了外国资本的利益企图夺取党和国家的领导，以达到毁灭我们共产党，并以最后导致资本主义复辟的投降政策来代替党多年来所制订的政策的目的。起初，贝利亚把他的活动巧妙地加以伪装和隐蔽。正在苏维埃国家国外的敌人加紧他们全部的反苏颠覆活动的时候，贝利亚变得傲慢自大、飞扬跋扈了。
    因此，贝利亚的被揭露，再一次证明了一个无可置辩的论点，这就是：如果反苏的敌视活动之线的
    一端是在苏联发现的话，那末，它的另一端就一定可以在包围着我们的资本主义国家内找到。因此，结论是：我们必须随时准备好我们的武器以对付资本主义的包围，我们必须不倦地提高我们的革命警惕。
    要尽力提高我们的革命警惕，要消除我们队伍中的麻痹与轻信，就必须坚决地改进党的一切工作。这就是要严格地遵守党所制订的领导原则和党的生活准则，首先是遵守集体领导的原则。
    一切组织和部门的工作必须要放在党的正规的和不断的监督之下。在挑选干部时必须坚决放弃一切狭隘的功利主义的办法，严格遵守党的按照政治品质与业务能力的标准来挑选干部的原则。
    特别重要的是：不断地加强和扩大党和群众的联系，注意倾听劳动人民的要求，不断地为提高工人、集体农民和知识分子——全体苏维埃人民——的生活水平而努力。必须以更大的决心和勇气来展开自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，必须使广大的劳动人民群众自己揭露缺点和不健康的现象，并且提出消灭它们的办法。
    以高度的革命警惕的精神来教育共产党员和全体劳动人民的工作，不是一种暂时的和短期的工作，而是全党和一切党组织必须经常关心的问题。不要忽视这个事实：虽然剥削阶级在我国被消灭了，可是资本主义残余在人们的意识中还没有根除。同时，党的宣传工作和对群众的政治教育工作有着严重的缺点。我们的任务就是消灭缺点，使我们的宣传工作和对群众的政治工作能以相信共产主义事业的不可战胜性的精神，以无限忠于党和社会主义祖国的精神来教育共产党员和全体人民。
    革命警惕是我们对付一切敌人的武器。我们要经常擦亮这个武器、随时准备采取行动，那么敌人的一切阴谋一定会遭到失败。
    提高共产党员和全体劳动人民的革命警惕！
