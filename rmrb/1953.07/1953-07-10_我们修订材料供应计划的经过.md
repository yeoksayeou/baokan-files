    Our Experience in Revising the Material Supply Plan
    Qi Guang, Deputy Director of the Basic Construction Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    In the responsibility system establishment campaign, the Basic Construction Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, following the instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, carefully revised the 1953 material supply plan. This brought the annual material supply plan closer to reality, overcame blindness in technical supply work, and avoided and changed the situation of serious material stockpiling, saving a large amount of basic construction investment for the country.
    Last year, the Basic Construction Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company began to pay attention to supplying materials to various units according to the plan. However, due to limited design capabilities, insufficient engineering and technical personnel, and lack of work experience, it was sometimes still in a state of planning, designing, preparing materials, and constructing simultaneously. The supply plan was often unrealistic, and the phenomenon of stockpiling on one hand and inability to guarantee supply on the other often occurred.
    The 1953 supply plan was initially formulated in the fourth quarter of last year. However, the results of the first quarter execution showed that the proportion of materials actually received by various engineering companies and business departments to the original proposed plan was: 32.4% for the Electrical Installation Engineering Company, 49.4% for the Mechanical Installation Engineering Company, 38.2% for the Metal Structure Engineering Company, 35.4% for the former First Civil Engineering Construction Company, 31.8% for the former Second Civil Engineering Construction Company, 51.7% for the Furnace Construction Engineering Company, 38% for the Industrial Pipeline Engineering Company, and 26.8% for the Geological Department. It can be seen that the planned situation and the actual needs were very inconsistent. On the other hand, various engineering companies frequently added to the plan, adding a total of 56 times in three months. The added numbers were huge. For steel alone, 3,625 tons were added at one time. Due to the inaccuracy of the plan, it also caused great blindness in material reserves. According to incomplete statistics at the end of the first quarter, the inventory value of the material department's warehouse alone was worth more than 433.6 billion yuan, excluding direct payments to construction sites listed as engineering company reserves. Among them, the value of stagnant materials not needed this year was 93.2 billion yuan. At the same time, the second quarter plan was still proposed according to the annual plan indicators. The old stockpiles were already serious, and new stockpiles were continuously increasing.
    The occurrence and development of this situation is mainly due to our vague understanding of the comprehensive policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe." Therefore, in terms of work policy, although we emphasized "facing the project and ensuring supply" (which is correct), we did not pay attention to economic accounting under the goal of "ensuring supply."
    When the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee and Anshan Iron and Steel Company proposed to oppose waste and irresponsibility and establish a responsibility system, the Ministry of Heavy Industry was instructing to revise the annual material supply plan. We combined the establishment of the responsibility system campaign and, with the assistance of the working groups of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Basic Construction Bank of Anshan City, mobilized all employees to conduct a careful revision of the annual material supply plan. In revising the plan, we first followed
    the principle of "specific personnel for specific tasks," and changed the planning department into specialized engineering planning groups for steel rolling, steelmaking, blast furnace, chemical industry, civil construction, and enterprise materials. We also strengthened the comprehensive planning group and the statistics group. Finally, it was determined that the main tasks of each specialized engineering planning group were to: frequently maintain close contact with the main contracting engineering companies and secondary contracting engineering companies of the project, and cooperate with on-site engineering technicians, planning staff, and material staff. According to the year, quarter, and month, and according to the sub- and main numbers of the project, check the drawings, check the name and specifications, and according to the project progress, jointly propose and review the materials required for the project, compile the demand plan, and provide the planning department's comprehensive planning group with the basis for compiling the technical supply plan. In daily work, participate in project balance meetings, understand the project progress at any time, and from each stage, actively check the name, specifications, quantity and required time of key and general materials (especially difficult materials), report to the material department in a timely manner, and take measures to ensure supply. The main task of the comprehensive planning group is to comprehensively summarize the demand plans proposed by various specialized engineering groups. According to the inventory statistics provided by the statistics group, compare them with each other, deduct the inventory, and compile the annual and quarterly technical supply plans and monthly allocation plans. And determine which are stagnant stockpiles, submit them to the stagnant material disposal department, and conduct intra- and extra-regional balance after approval by higher-level organizations. The main task of the statistics group is to fill in quarterly and monthly inventory statistics according to the forms prescribed by the National Bureau of Statistics and the company's planning department, and provide them to higher-level agencies and this unit as the basis for compiling technical supply plans.
    Secondly, the basis for revising the plan was determined, mainly full drawings with drawings; technical designs for those without drawings; and average quotas for those without technical designs. In the revision, we opposed the conservative idea of ​​"cutting wide and using narrow" on the one hand, and paid attention to preventing blind reduction and the adventurous practice of not storing reserves on the other hand. The following principles were determined:
    First, for important materials that have no domestic source and are imported from abroad, make annual or multi-year reserve plans based on cross-year engineering tasks.
    Second, for those with domestic sources, but with long processing and ordering times, and not easy to purchase, make annual or cross-quarter reserves according to the actual needs of the project.
    Third, for major materials commonly needed for national defense and national basic construction projects, such as steel, wood, and cement, compress them as much as possible to the minimum limit, but ensure that major projects do not lack materials.
    Fourth, for Anshan Iron and Steel's own products, or those that are easy to process and order, no additional reserves will be made other than quarterly needs.
    After twenty-four days of finding basis, checking needs, checking inventory, carefully compiling, and carefully reviewing, the work of revising the annual plan was completed. As a result, the demand was greatly reduced, saving a total of 289 billion yuan in national investment.
    After the plan was reduced, several review meetings were held. During the review, many omissions were found, such as the First Blooming Mill and the First Steelmaking Plant failing to mention the mechanical and electrical materials for temporary processing. These omissions were promptly added to make the plan closer to reality. In addition, many transcription errors were found and corrected during the review.
    The result of revising the plan not only strengthened the accuracy of the plan, but also deeply educated every material worker. Everyone realized that although there are many objective difficulties today, as long as we are willing to face reality and do everything possible to grasp accurate information, an accurate material supply plan can still be compiled. This lays a good foundation for strengthening plan management in the future.
    In conjunction with the revision of the supply plan, we transferred 16 cadres, with the cooperation of comrades from the Basic Construction Bank of Anshan City and the Northeast Basic Construction Bank, and after a month, thoroughly cleaned up the material general warehouse. Stagnant materials worth 160 billion yuan were cleared out and promptly handed over to the state for external transfer. Together with the reduction of the plan, the entire department saved a total of 449 billion yuan in national basic construction funds. In particular, the large quantities of I-beams, channel steel, medium and thick plates, non-ferrous metals, and seamless steel pipes handed over to the state for external transfer are all urgently needed materials for domestic basic construction unit projects.
    According to normal working steps, technical supply plan management should first have the planning department propose a material demand plan based on the construction drawings and material volumes provided by the design department, and then the material department formulate a material supply plan based on the demand plan and combined with the inventory. However, in the current situation where technical design and construction drawings cannot keep up with the needs of material preparation, the material department should proactively and actively cooperate with the construction unit to grasp the situation as much as possible and help the planning department formulate demand plans and supply plans. In compiling technical supply plans, we believe that the following issues must be noted:
    First, we must oppose the conservative idea of "cutting wide and using narrow," and we must also prevent the rash idea of ​​blind reduction and neglecting reserves. Ensuring supply must be the fundamental principle.
    Second, the formulation of technical supply plans must be done more accurately and closer to reality with close cooperation between the material department and the construction department. When we revised the plan, we encountered many ideological obstacles. At that time, the various engineering companies had already started work and were busy compiling construction organization designs. The engineering and technical personnel all said: "Construction first, materials second." Some units simply did not pay attention to it, believing that it would be difficult to be accurate anyway because the drawings were incomplete. These ideas were corrected after repeated criticism by the company's leadership. Because the construction department took active action and came up with more accurate original records, it provided us with good conditions for formulating the plan.
    Third, implement a layer-by-layer plan responsibility system. Under the annual plan, quarterly plans and monthly plans should be formulated. In order to ensure supply, omissions in the annual plan can be added in the quarter, and omissions in the quarterly plan can be added in the first month of the quarter. However, adding and extracting materials must maintain a certain amount of time. In addition, additions outside the monthly plan should be limited, and the style of submitting a plan in one hand and requesting materials in the other must be opposed.
    Fourth, due to the carelessness of technical, planning, and material personnel, loopholes in the plan are currently difficult to completely eliminate. Therefore, material supply agencies cannot completely adopt an irresponsible attitude of listening and believing in the material request plan submitted by the user unit. They must understand its usage project number, the actual quantity of the project, the unit quota, the specific specifications, and whether there is any inventory, etc., and allocate materials according to actual needs. Therefore, "facing the project and facing the warehouse" is the minimum condition that every material worker must have.

    我们修订材料供应计划的经过
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设材料处副处长　齐光
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设材料处在建立责任制运动中，根据中央人民政府重工业部指示，慎重地修订了一九五三年材料供应计划，使全年材料供应计划接近实际，克服了技术供应工作上的盲目性，而且避免和改变了材料严重积压的状况，为国家节约了大量基本建设投资。
    去年，鞍钢基本建设材料处就开始注意按计划供应各单位所需的材料，但由于设计能力有限，工程技术人员不足，工作经验缺乏，因此有时仍处于一面计划，一面设计，一面备料，一面施工的状态，供应计划往往不切实际，常常发生一面积压、一面不能保证供应的现象。
    一九五三年的供应计划在去年第四季度就已初步制定。但今年第一季度执行结果，各工程公司及各业务处实领材料占原提计划的比例是：电气安装工程公司为百分之三十二点四，机械安装工程公司为百分之四十九点四，金属结构工程公司为百分之三十八点二，原第一土木建筑工程公司为百分之三十五点四，原第二土木建筑工程公司为百分之三十一点八，筑炉工程公司为百分之五十一点七，工业管道工程公司为百分之三十八，地质处为百分之二十六点八，可见计划和实际需要的情况很不相符。另一方面，各工程公司又频频追加计划，三个月中共追加五十六次。追加数字庞大，只钢铁一项，一次就追加了三千六百二十五吨。由于计划不精确，还造成了材料储备上的极大盲目性。据第一季度末不完全统计，库存额除直付工地列为工程公司储备额内不计外，仅材料处仓库库存额就值四千三百三十六亿多元。其中有本年不需要之呆滞材料值九百三十二亿元。同时第二季度计划仍是按全年计划指标提出的，旧的积压既已严重，新的积压又在陆续增长。
    这种情况的发生和发展，主要是由于我们对“好、快、省、安全”的全面政策认识模糊。因此，在工作方针上，虽然强调了“面向工程，保证供应”（这是正确的），但没有在“保证供应”的目标下注意经济核算。
    当中共鞍山市委和鞍山钢铁公司提出反对浪费、反对无人负责，建立责任制时，中央重工业部正指示修正全年物资供应计划。我们就结合建立责任制运动，在重工业部与鞍山市基本建设银行工作组的协助下，发动全体职工，将全年材料供应计划进行了一次慎重的修改。在修订计划中，我们首先按照
    “事有专人，人有专事”的原则，把计划科改为轧钢、炼钢、高炉、化工、土木建筑、企业用料等专业工程计划组，并充实了综合计划组和统计组的力量。最后确定：各专业工程计划组的主要任务是：经常与工程的主包工程公司和二包工程公司密切联系，从与现场工程技术人员、计划工作人员、材料工作人员共同合作中，按年、季、月，依工程子、母号，查明图纸根据，查明品名、规格，依工程进度，共同提出，审核工程上所需材料，编出需用计划，提供计划科综合计划组作编制技术供应计划的依据。并在日常工作中，参加工程平衡会议，随时了解工程进度，从每一阶段中，主动地查明关键性和一般性的材料（特别是困难材料）的品名，规格、数量与需要时间，及时报到材料处，采取措施，确保供应。综合计划组的主要任务是：把各专业工程组提出的需要计划，加以综合汇总。根据统计组提出的库存统计，互相对照，扣除库存，编制年、季技术供应计划与各月分拨计划。并确定哪些是呆滞积压材料，提交呆滞材料处理科，经上级组织批准，进行区内、外平衡。统计组的主要任务是：根据国家统计局和公司计划处规定的表格，按季按月填制季度、月度库存统计，供给上级机关和本单位作为编制技术供应计划的依据。
    其次，确定了修订计划的依据，主要是有图纸的全照图纸；没有图纸的依技术设计；没有技术设计的则依照平均定额。我们在修订中一方面反对“宽打窄用”的保守思想，同时注意了防止盲目削减、不要储备的冒险作法。确定了下列几项原则：
    第一，国内无来源由国外入口的重要材料，依据跨年工程任务，作年度或跨年储备打算。
    第二，国内有来源，但加工订货时间较长，且不易购到者，按工程实际需要，作年内，或跨季储备。
    第三，对国防和全国基本建设工程普遍需要之主要材料，如钢材、木材、水泥，尽可能压缩到最低限度，但须保证主要工程不缺材料。
    第四，对鞍钢自产品，或易于加工订货者，除季度需要外，不另作储备。
    经过二十四天的找根据、查需要、对库存、认真编订、慎重审查，修改全年计划的工作方告完成。结果大大削减了需要量，共节约国家投资两千八百九十亿元。
    计划削减之后，又作了数次会审。会审中，发现许多遗漏，如第一初轧厂、第一制钢厂漏提临时加工用的机械、电气材料等。对这些遗漏，及时予以追加，使计划进一步接近实际。此外在审核中，还发现并改正了很多抄写时的笔误。
    修订计划的结果，不仅加强了计划的准确性，同时使每一个材料工作人员，都受到深刻的教育。大家认识到：今天虽然客观上存在着很多困难，但只要肯于面对实际，尽一切可能掌握准确的资料，准确的材料供应计划还是可以编制出来的。这就给全处今后加强计划管理打下了良好的基础。
    结合修订供应计划，我们抽调了十六名干部，在鞍山市基本建设银行和东北基本建设银行的工作同志配合之下，经过了一个月的时间，彻底清理了材料总仓库。清理出价值一千六百亿元的呆滞材料，及时交给国家外调。加上削减计划，全处共计节约国家基本建设资金达四千四百九十亿元。特别是交给国家外调的大批工字钢、槽钢、中厚板、有色金属、无缝钢管等，都是国内基本建设单位工程急需的材料。
    技术供应计划管理，依着正常工作步骤，应当先由计划部门根据设计部门提出的施工图纸和材料卷提出材料需用计划，然后由材料处依照需用计划，结合库存，制订材料供应计划。不过在目前技术设计、施工图纸都赶不上备料需要的情况下，材料部门则应主动地积极地与施工单位合作，尽可能掌握情况，帮助计划部门制订需用计划，和供应计划。在编制技术供应计划上，我们认为必须注意以下几个问题：
    第一、既必须反对“宽打窄用”的保守思想，又必须防止盲目削减、忽略储备的冒进思想，必须以确保供应为根本原则。
    第二、制订技术供应计划，必须在材料部门和施工部门双方密切合作下，才能做得比较精确，比较接近实际。我们在修订计划时，曾遇到不少思想障碍，当时，正是各工程公司已经开工，忙于编制施工组织设计的时候，工程技术人员都说：“施工第一，材料次之”，有的单位就根本不予重视，认为反正图纸不全，怎么修改也很难准确，这些思想经过公司领导上反复批判，才得到纠正。由于施工部门积极行动起来，拿出了较准确的原始记录，就给我们制订计划提供了良好条件。
    第三、贯彻层层计划责任制，在年度计划之下，应制订季度计划和月度计划。为了保证供应，年计划的漏项，可在季度内追加，季度计划的漏项，可在当季度的第一个月追加。不过追加与提料必须保持一定时间。另外月计划以外的追加，应当有限制，那种一手提计划，一手要材料的作风必须反对。
    第四、由于技术、计划、材料人员一时的粗枝大叶，造成计划上的漏洞，目前还难完全消灭，因此，材料供应机关，对使用单位提出的要料计划，不能完全采取听之信之的不负责态度，必须了解其使用工号，工程确实数量，单位定额，具体规格，有无库存等情况，根据实际需要而拨给。因而，“面向工程、面向仓库”是每个材料工作人员必备的起码条件。
