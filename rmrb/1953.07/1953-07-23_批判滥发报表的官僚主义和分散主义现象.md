Criticizing the Bureaucratic and Decentralized Phenomenon of Excessive Report Issuance

The excessive issuance of investigation and statistical reports is a prominent manifestation of bureaucracy and decentralization in many leading organs and an important component of the "five excesses" in rural areas. However, some leading organs have not deeply recognized the serious harm of excessive report issuance. Therefore, in the struggle against bureaucracy, they still issue forms downwards without limitation. For this phenomenon, it is very necessary for newspapers to conduct sharp exposure, "giving the patient a heavy stimulus, shouting at them: 'You are sick!' startling the patient, causing them to sweat, and then properly treating them." (Mao Zedong: "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing"). Recently, the Beijing Daily used vivid facts to powerfully carry out this propaganda.

The phenomenon of excessive report issuance by many organs in Beijing is very serious. Although the Beijing Municipal People's Government made a decision on January 9 this year to rectify statistical reports, there are still many units that arbitrarily formulate reports and issue them randomly without approval. The Beijing Daily, in conjunction with the Beijing Municipal People's Government's top-down inspection, conducted a typical investigation in the Qianmen District of the city and launched a bottom-up exposure by holding a symposium to mobilize the broad masses of grassroots cadres. After deeply understanding the situation in all aspects from the masses, the newspaper prominently reported the chaotic phenomenon of excessive report issuance by many municipal organs on June 18, using a large portion of the front page. The Beijing Daily used rich factual materials to expose and analyze various manifestations of this chaotic phenomenon. For example: 1. Multiple leaders, each doing their own thing, without communication, and repeated requests. From January to October last year, the Agricultural and Forestry Section of Haidian District issued 44 kinds of forms to each village, including those from the central agricultural and forestry departments, the North China agricultural and forestry departments, the Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and its affiliated sections, and the District People's Government and its Agricultural and Forestry Section. Many of these forms had duplicate content. There were five forms for investigating the situation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement alone, and the content was basically the same, only the sources of the forms were different. 2. No plan, no research, doing while investigating, and investigating again and again. For example, the Industry and Commerce Section of the Qianmen District People's Government has conducted 18 investigations and statistics on industrial and commercial households since the end of the "Five-Anti" movement last year, forwarding and creating many reports. However, because the scope of the investigation was inconsistent before and after, and it was deployed in a scattered and piecemeal manner, complete statistical materials for each industry could not be grasped. 3. Trivial requirements, broad scope, unclear purpose, and detachment from reality. For example, the Municipal Public Health Bureau originally only needed to conduct typical investigations to promote the new-style childcare method and painless childbirth method, but the bureau issued very trivial reports to the health centers in each district, requiring extensive investigation and filling in among residents. The survey form on childcare methods had seven major columns and eighty-seven items, even including what kind of play the child was doing, whether they touched their mother's breast when sleeping, etc. The report on painless childbirth methods had four types, and the investigation covered the mother's education level, political level, personality, whether she lived in an independent courtyard or a mixed courtyard, the mother's parents-in-law, aunts, uncles, parents, brothers, sisters, lover, and other family members' understanding of painless childbirth, etc. 4. All kinds of things, wanting everything, nothing strange, inexplicable. For example, the Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Bureau once asked villages to fill in the slope of farmers' reclaimed land, count how much black sorghum stalks farmers pulled out, and count the number of millet plants suffering from white hair disease. The Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee once organized residents and activists to count how many times pedestrians spat on the street, at a cost of 2,000 yuan per person per day. 5. Doing whatever they want, counting everything, wasting manpower, and not caring about the cost. For example, the Municipal Agricultural and Forestry Bureau made epidemic prevention injections for local chickens in each district this spring. The total value of the vaccine was 120,000 yuan, but a notice was issued requiring each district to conduct a general survey among citizens to count the number of chickens prepared to receive epidemic prevention injections. The Wacha Hutong Police Station in Dongsi District alone mobilized 88 resident activists for this purpose, spending a total of more than 1,200 hours.

The Beijing Daily not only used a large number of facts to expose the serious situation of excessive report issuance by leading organs, but also strongly publicized the serious consequences caused by excessive statistical reports with typical examples such as the childcare method survey conducted by the Municipal Public Health Bureau, the chicken vaccine injection statistics conducted by the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, and the environmental sanitation work statistics conducted by the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee. On June 20, the newspaper made such a vivid description of the environmental sanitation work statistics of the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee: The Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee once asked each district to fill in a "Environmental Sanitation Work Statistics Ten-Day Report." This report had twenty-two items, including: how many mosquitoes, flies, and rats were caught, how many catties of mosquito larvae were salvaged, how many fly pupae were dug out and destroyed, how many maggots were eliminated, how many catties of weeds were salvaged, how many tree holes were blocked, how many pits and depressions, and how many cubic meters, were filled in, etc. After this report was issued, it immediately caused serious chaos in the work of resident activists. Health committee members and health team leaders were exhausted collecting mosquito, fly, and rat tails door-to-door to complete the "task"... To clarify the numbers, they used balances to weigh broken mosquitoes, used fine sieves to sift fly pupae mixed with soil, and floated maggots with stool and urine in clean water. Because the higher-ups were chasing the statistics tightly, some activists abandoned the propaganda work of the health campaign and only knew to ask the masses for numbers all day long, forming coercion and commandism. In some places, school children were organized to go out to kill mosquitoes and flies after school every day instead of taking a nap or doing homework. Naturally, no matter how hard people tried, they could not accurately count these mosquitoes, flies, mosquito larvae, maggots... Many numbers were "estimated" and "approximately calculated." And in order to pursue numbers, there were even cases of buying and selling rat tails and impersonating rat tails with carrot roots in some places.

The Beijing Daily used vivid facts to educate people to recognize the bad results of excessive report issuance, that is: "Seriously increasing the workload of grassroots political power organs, bringing many unnecessary disturbances to the broad masses of people; at the same time, it also hinders the timely and correct reporting of regular national statistical reports." Because the newspaper did not conduct general and perfunctory exposure, but conducted sharp and powerful specific exposure, this criticism immediately aroused the vigilance of relevant organs and attracted the broad masses to actively participate in bottom-up supervision. For example, many staff members of the Municipal Education Bureau originally did not have sufficient understanding of the important significance of correcting the phenomenon of excessive report issuance. Since the Beijing Daily exposed the situation that the departments and offices of the bureau were not in contact with each other and randomly arranged reports to the cultural and educational sections of the district people's governments on June 18, "most staff members of the bureau had a further understanding of the serious consequences of excessive report issuance." Weng Dujian, director of the bureau, also convened a report to all cadres on June 20, requesting a cleanup of existing forms and stipulating specific measures to correct excessive report issuance. After discovering that the office of a central-level guest house did not contact the local industrial and commercial administrative department and independently arranged a "Private Restaurant and Hotel Survey Form" to merchants through the hotel association, readers Song Xiangzhou and Qi Menghou immediately wrote to the newspaper, requesting "the State Statistical Bureau to correct this behavior of excessive report issuance by the office of the central-level guest house."

Of course, opposing excessive report issuance does not mean canceling all reports. The Beijing Daily emphasized in the short commentary "Seriously Rectify and Strengthen Statistical Work" on June 20 that what we oppose are only "many unrealistic statistical forms that are difficult to fill in and useless" that are formulated bureaucratically and formalistically, and issued randomly without approval, without considering actual needs and possibilities. Therefore, opposing such statistical forms "is precisely to overcome the shortcomings in the current statistical work and improve and strengthen statistical work," in order to "gradually establish practical and feasible statistical work... so that we can grasp accurate statistical data to formulate plans, guide work, and better serve the country's large-scale economic construction." The newspaper clearly put forward what to oppose and what to establish, which pointed out the direction of efforts for the broad masses. The Beijing Daily not only pointed out this in the short commentary, but also successively reported the preliminary rectification of statistical work by units such as the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Education Bureau in subsequent reports. Obviously, the Beijing Daily should strengthen propaganda in this regard in the future, and especially need to use specific and vivid examples to report how each unit deeply criticized bureaucracy, formalism, and independent decentralization that are divorced from reality in the process of rectifying statistical work, thereby improving work style. It should be pointed out that the Beijing Daily did not analyze and criticize the ideological roots of this phenomenon while exposing the phenomenon of excessive report issuance, which cannot but be a shortcoming.

In addition to the Beijing Daily, the Shanghai Liberation Daily, the Hubei Daily, the Heilongjiang Daily, the Sichuan Daily, the Xikang Daily, and the Suiyuan Daily have also recently conducted relatively powerful exposures of the phenomenon of excessive report issuance. In addition to publishing the instructions of the East China Administrative Committee on sorting out statistical reports and the order of the Hubei Provincial People's Government to stop the excessive issuance of investigation and statistical forms, the Liberation Daily and the Hubei Daily have both specifically reported the serious chaotic phenomenon caused by excessive report issuance according to the actual situation in the local area. The Hubei Daily also called on "statistical workers and all working comrades in the province to expose and report the phenomenon of excessive form issuance with a responsible attitude towards the country and the people in a short commentary, so as to achieve the purpose of resolutely eliminating excessive form issuance." In May, the Heilongjiang Daily combined the propaganda of "Spring plowing production is the overriding central task in rural areas," continuously published readers' letters, and criticized the style of some leading organs that subjectively and randomly issued reports without considering the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy and rural work, pointing out that leading organs should "send more people directly to the lower levels to talk with comrades at the lower levels and study the actual situation," and "do more typical investigations and research, and concentrate the demands of the masses from bottom to top." The Sichuan Daily, Xikang Daily, and Suiyuan Daily exposed the harm of excessive report issuance to rural work and production through typical investigation materials from a district, a township, and a village. At present, all localities are deeply carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy and vigorously cleaning up the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas. Newspapers should be good at grasping the major or common problems existing in the current work, powerfully use the weapons of self-criticism and bottom-up criticism, and set off mass supervision to resist "bureaucracy that makes work chaotic and makes the masses exhausted to cope with" and decentralization, and resolutely struggle "to achieve a simple government and diligent people policy that is conducive to the development of production."

### 批判滥发报表的官僚主义和分散主义现象

    批判滥发报表的官僚主义和分散主义现象
    滥发调查统计报表，是许多领导机关官僚主义和分散主义的突出表现之一，也是构成农村“五多”的一个重要内容。但是有些领导机关由于没有深刻地认识到滥发报表的严重危害性，所以在反官僚主义斗争中仍然无限制地向下乱发表格。对于这种现象，报纸进行尖锐的揭发，“重重地给患病者一个刺激，向他们大喝一声，说：‘你有病呀！’使患者为之一惊，出一身汗，然后好好地叫他们治疗。”（毛主席：“反对党八股”）是很有必要的。最近北京日报就用生动的事实有力地进行了这一宣传。
    北京市许多机关滥发报表的现象是很严重的，虽经市人民政府行政会议于今年一月九日作出整顿统计报表的决定，但是还有不少单位仍然是任意制订报表，不经核准，随便乱发。北京日报结合着北京市人民政府自上而下的检查，在该市前门区进行了典型调查，并以开座谈会的方式发动广大基层干部进行自下而上的揭发。在深入群众掌握了各方面的情况后，报纸在六月十八日以一版大部篇幅突出地报道了市属许多机关滥发报表的混乱现象。北京日报用丰富的事实材料揭露和分析了这种混乱现象的各种表现。如：一、领导多头，各搞一套，互不通气，重复索取。去年一月到十月，海淀区农林科发给各村的表格就有四十四种，其中有中央农林部门的、华北农林部门的、市农林局及其所属各科的和区人民政府及其农林科的。这些表格很多内容重复，仅调查互助合作运动情况的表格就有五种，而内容基本上相同，只是表格的来源不同而已。二、没有计划，不作研究，边做边查，查了再查。如前门区人民政府工商科，从去年“五反”运动结束到现在，在工商户中作了十八次调查统计，转发和自制了许多报表，但因调查的范围前后不一致，又是分散零星的布置，所以始终掌握不住各行业完整的统计材料。三、要求繁琐，范围广阔，目的不明，脱离实际。如市公共卫生局为了推行新式育儿法和无痛分娩法，本来只作典型调查即可，但该局却向各区卫生所颁发了十分繁琐的报表，要求在居民中广泛调查填报。关于育儿法的调查表有七大栏八十七个项目，连小孩作何玩耍、睡眠时是否摸着母亲的乳房等都在填报之列。关于无痛分娩法的报表有四种，调查所及，包括产妇的文化程度，政治水平，性格，住独院还是杂院，产妇的公婆、姑、叔、父母、兄弟、姊妹、爱人及其他家人对无痛分娩法的认识，等等。四、五花八门，什么都要，无奇不有，莫名其妙。例如市农林局曾要求村里填写农民开荒地点的坡度，统计农民拔除黑高粱秸多少，统计谷子患白发病的株数。市爱国卫生运动委员会曾以每人每天二千元的代价，组织居民积极分子统计行人在街头吐了多少口痰。五、随心所欲，遇事统计，浪费人力，在所不惜。例如市农林局今春为各区土种鸡作防疫注射，疫苗总共值十二万元，却发出通知要各区在市民中普遍作一次调查，统计准备接受防疫注射的鸡数。仅东四区瓦岔胡同派出所就为此动员了八十八个居民积极分子，共约花费一千二百多个小时。
    北京日报不仅用大量的事实揭露了领导机关滥发报表的严重情况，而且以市公共卫生局所作的育儿法调查、农林局所作的鸡疫苗注射统计和市爱国卫生运动委员会所作的环境卫生工作统计等典型事例，强烈地宣传了滥发统计报表所引起的严重后果。六月二十日该报对市爱国卫生运动委员会的环境卫生工作统计，就曾作了这样生动的描述：市爱国卫生运动委员会曾要各区填报一种“环境卫生工作统计旬报表”，这张报表有二十二个项目，包括：捕打了多少个蚊子，苍蝇，老鼠，打捞了多少斤孑孓，挖灭了多少个蝇蛹，消灭了多少个蛆，打捞了多少斤杂草，堵塞了多少个树洞，填平了多少处、多少公方坑洼，等等。这张报表发下后，立即造成了居民积极分子工作的严重忙乱。卫生委员和卫生小组长们为了完成“任务”，疲于奔命地挨门挨户收集蚊、蝇、老鼠尾巴……。为了弄清数字，他们用戥子来称碎了的蚊子，用细筛子筛那和泥土混在一起的蝇蛹，把带屎挂尿的蛆放在清水里漂。因为上面追统计数字追得紧，有些积极分子放弃了卫生运动的宣传工作，只知整天向群众要数字，形成强迫命令。有些地方则把入学的儿童组织起来，要他们每天下课后不睡午觉，不作功课，先去打蚊、蝇。自然，不管人们如何努力，也无法把这些蚊、蝇、孑孓、蛆……统计清楚，很多数字都是“估堆”“约计”得来的。而为了追求数字，有些地方更出现了买卖老鼠尾巴和以胡萝卜根冒充老鼠尾巴的事情。
    北京日报以活生生的事实教育人们认识滥发报表的恶果，那就是：“严重地增加了基层政权机关的工作负担，给广大人民群众带来许多不必要的烦扰；同时，也妨碍了正规的国家统计报表的及时而正确的上报。”正因为报纸不是一般地和泛泛地进行揭发，而是尖锐有力地进行了具体的揭发，因此该报这一批评立即引起了有关机关的警惕，并吸引了广大群众积极参加自下而上的监督。例如市教育局的许多工作人员原来对于纠正滥发报表现象的重要意义认识不足，自从六月十八日北京日报揭发了该局各科、室互不联系，乱向各区人民政府文教科布置报表的情况后，该局“大部分工作人员对滥发报表的严重后果才有了进一步的认识”，该局翁独健局长并于六月二十日召集全局干部作了一次报告，要求对现有表格进行清理，并规定了纠正滥发报表的具体办法。读者宋相舟、齐孟侯在发现中央一级招待所办公室不与当地工商行政部门联系，自行通过旅店公会向商户布置“私营饭店旅馆调查表”后，立即向报纸投书，要求“国家统计局纠正中央一级招待所办公室这种滥发报表的行为”。
    自然，反对滥发报表，并不是取消一切报表。北京日报在六月二十日“认真整顿和加强统计工作”的短评中曾着重指出，我们所反对的只是不考虑实际需要和可能，官僚主义、形式主义地制订的，不经核准、随便乱发的“许多不切实际，既难填、又无用的统计表格”。所以反对这种统计表格，“正是为了克服目前统计工作中的缺点，改进和加强统计工作”，为了“逐步地建立起实用的可行的统计工作……使我们能掌握准确的统计资料来制订计划，指导工作，更好地为国家大规模经济建设服务”。报纸明确地提出反对什么，建立什么，这就为广大群众指明了努力的方向。北京日报不仅在短评中指出了这一点，而且在以后的报道中，陆续地反映了市爱国卫生运动委员会和教育局等单位初步整顿统计工作的情况。显然，北京日报今后应该加强这方面的宣传，特别需要运用具体生动的事例，报道各单位在整顿统计工作的过程中如何深入批判脱离实际的官僚主义、形式主义和各自为政的分散主义，从而改进了工作作风。应该指出，北京日报在揭发滥发报表现象的同时，没有对这种现象所由产生的思想根源进行分析批判，这不能不是一个缺点。
    除北京日报外，近来上海解放日报、湖北日报、黑龙江日报、四川日报、西康日报、绥远日报等报也曾对滥发报表现象进行了较为有力的揭发。解放日报和湖北日报除公布了华东行政委员会关于整理统计报表的指示和湖北省人民政府制止滥发调查统计表格的命令外，都曾根据当地实际情况具体地报道了滥发报表所造成的严重混乱现象，湖北日报并在短评中号召“全省统计工作者和全体工作同志要以对国家和人民负责的态度来揭发和检举滥发表格的现象，以达到坚决肃清滥发表格的目的。”黑龙江日报在五月份曾结合“春耕生产是当前农村压倒一切的中心工作”的宣传，连续发表读者来信，对某些领导机关不考虑小农经济和农村工作的特点，主观主义地乱发报表的作风提出批评，指出领导机关应该“多派人直接到下边去，找下边同志面谈，研究实际情况”，“多做典型的调查研究，多自下而上地集中群众的要求”。四川日报、西康日报和绥远日报则通过一个区、一个乡、一个村的典型调查材料，揭露了滥发报表对于农村工作和生产的危害。目前各地正在深入开展反对官僚主义的斗争和大力清理农村的“五多”现象，报纸要善于抓住当前工作中存在的重大的或带普遍性的问题，有力地运用自我批评和自下而上批评的武器，掀起群众性的监督，来抵制“工作繁乱而使群众疲于应付的官僚主义”和分散主义，为“实现一个利于发展生产的政简民勤的政策”而坚决斗争。
