    What the Washington Conference Tells Us
    —Editorial by the Soviet “Pravda”
    The five-day meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France concluded in Washington a few days ago. In their final communique, the participants stated that they sought solutions sufficient to satisfy "the common hopes of their governments and peoples for peace, freedom, and justice." However, the outcome of the meeting shows that these talks about peace, freedom, and justice were used to achieve entirely different objectives.
    The Washington communique shows that the tripartite foreign ministers' meeting did not help resolve any issues in international disputes. Regarding the Korean armistice and the attitude towards the People's Republic of China, it must be pointed out that British representative Salisbury and French Foreign Minister Bidault yielded to Dulles' pressure. Salisbury and Bidault, in fact, agreed that if the American military's puppet and adventurer Syngman Rhee deemed it appropriate to obstruct the armistice and launch another adventure, they would support him. At the same time, Britain and France, against their own vital interests, agreed to continue the trade blockade against China after the Korean armistice and to obstruct the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations.
    Simultaneously, it must be pointed out that the Washington tripartite foreign ministers' meeting was held in an atmosphere of discord and increasingly sharp contradictions between the United States and its allies. This was primarily manifested in a major issue that troubled the three foreign ministers: what attitude should Western countries adopt in light of the increasingly widespread and urgent demand for resolving international disputes through consultation and easing international tensions? This demand has grown stronger as the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy gradually eliminates all obstacles erected by the enemies of international cooperation to the resolution of international outstanding issues.
    What does the fact that no Soviet representative participated in the Washington tripartite foreign ministers' meeting tell us? This fact tells us, first and foremost, that the participants in this meeting were unwilling to abide by the most basic international rules and standards. If the governments of the United States, Britain, and France truly wished to discuss various international issues with the Soviet government, there were normal channels to follow, according to the usual international standards. Before the Four-Power conference, it is not considered normal for the representatives of the three countries to conspire, even attempting to impose on the subsequent Four-Power conference the time and agenda for holding the Four-Power conference that were passed without the participation of one of the four countries and behind the back of one of the four countries.
    It is difficult to consider it normal to prepare for a Four-Power conference with such a procedure. It is also difficult to believe that Britain and France will not find themselves bound by this once the Four-Power representatives' meeting is held.
    American newspapers pointed out that Secretary of State Dulles intended to persuade the representatives of Britain and France to shelve the proposal for holding talks, if they were unwilling to completely abandon it. Dulles also intended to persuade the British and French representatives to intensify the notorious American "Cold War," that is, to imitate the provocation launched by foreign employers in Berlin on June 17, and to implement a policy of sabotage, adventure, and provocation against the countries of the democratic camp.
    Judging from newspaper reports, it can be known that Salisbury and Bidault's response to this request was that if they abandoned the proposal for Four-Power talks and followed the course suggested by the United States, their governments would find themselves in a difficult position, because the American approach was encountering increasingly fierce resistance in their countries. They said that Churchill's proposal to immediately hold a "summit conference" with Soviet participation to discuss and resolve international disputes was based on a sober assessment of the international situation and was in response to the demands of broad sections of the people in Western European countries. They had to admit that ignoring this demand of the people and continuing to pursue a pro-American policy on this issue would cause the most serious difficulties within Western Europe.
    Even the influential American business newspaper "The Wall Street Journal" had to admit that "British and French officials seem to have the general feeling that their people want a meeting – the people insist on it – and therefore unless such a meeting is held, they will not only fail to achieve anything in concrete Cold War actions, but will also be voted out of office in the elections." It is no accident that this newspaper admits this.
    The newspaper said that these arguments forced Dulles to agree to hold Four-Power talks with Soviet participation, although he had used "all his arguments" to oppose this proposal.
    Therefore, the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France were forced to yield to the demands of the broad masses of the people – their agreement and support for resolving outstanding international issues through consultation – not because they loved peace, but because they feared that their purposes in opposing international cooperation would be completely exposed.
    However, after agreeing to make this concession to public demands, American diplomats, with the support of their British and French partners, did everything possible to exploit the decision just made in Washington, not for the real resolution of extremely important international issues, but for their own purposes, which had nothing in common with the issue of easing international tensions.
    Dulles, who has always expressed the views of extreme reactionaries, also achieved his goals to some extent in this regard. Under American pressure, British and French representatives abandoned the proposal for a broad meeting of the heads of the Four-Power countries, which was a step backward compared to the proposal put forward by Churchill and supported by British and French public opinion.
    The Washington communique further illustrates another retreat from the previous attitude. The communique shows that they are attempting to narrow the work of the Four-Power conference, limiting it to discussing only a few issues related to Germany and Austria. From the communique, one gets the impression that the participants in the Washington conference hope to avoid talking about the major issue of easing international tensions, and even think it is possible to ignore this issue.
    In reality, the participants in the Washington conference merely reiterated the contents of the infamous note sent by the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet Union as early as September 23, 1952. As everyone knows, in this note, they, as before, once again hopelessly attempted to narrow the scope of the German issue, reducing the whole matter to the issue of holding all-German elections, which the Western countries planned to control, and thereby allow all the reactionaries, and even fascists, to do whatever they wanted throughout Germany. What the drafters of the communique said made it clear that the results of the June 17th Berlin adventure, in which a lot of dollars were spent, all paid from that $100 million fund specifically used to finance all kinds of sabotage, espionage, terrorist activities, and crimes, had once again made this short-sighted plan appear.
    The participants in the Washington conference pretended that they hoped to study the German and Austrian issues at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. But in fact, the Washington communique did not prove in the slightest that they would work to ensure that these pressing issues were quickly resolved.
    For example, the participants in the Washington conference did discuss the German issue, but not at all to help solve the main issues involved in this regard. They did not mention at all that, due to the fault of the United States, Britain, and France, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany has not only been delayed until now without being resolved, but even the review has not been properly conducted. They talked a lot about the issue of German unification, but it is clear that the Washington conference does not hope for German unification or the early formation of an all-German government. As in 1952 and previous years, they again reduced this issue to holding new negotiations on all-German elections, which would then make it possible to delay the resolution of the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of the German people in one country.
    For them, this does not seem to be, and cannot be, an issue of an early unified Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, because for them, the German issue lies primarily in strengthening the rule of the Adenauer group in West Germany, where perhaps this group's days are numbered. They cannot fail to see that the change in the mood of the West German people is unfavorable to Adenauer and his fascist revanchist group, and the Social Democrats may replace Adenauer tomorrow. Their problem is: how to support and strengthen the rule of the Adenauer types who serve the American war effort and are increasingly hated by the German people.
    On September 6, the Bonn Republic will hold parliamentary elections, in which the West German people may drive the Adenauer group out of the government. Therefore, Adenauer's protectors must get busy. It has now reached the point where even the French Foreign Minister had to sign in Washington, indicating that he would support the Adenauer group, although the entire significance of the existence of this group is the revival of German militarism and the re-establishment of a Hitler "Defense Force" by various means.
    It is no accident that the communique openly emphasized that the three countries will continue to work to implement the plan to establish a "European Army." This plan stipulates the remilitarization of West Germany and the joining of West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive group. On the other hand, everyone knows that the Bonn Treaty, which the United States is striving to get countries to ratify, stipulates that if Germany achieves unification, it must assume all the international obligations of the West German government, which naturally includes the obligation to participate in the "European Army."
    Everyone knows that the purpose of these plans is to make Germany a militaristic country again, to make the German army the backbone of the "European Army," and to become the shock troops of the North Atlantic aggressive alliance. If these plans are realized, everyone knows that it would be equivalent to unleashing the most combative militaristic force in Central Europe and reviving a hotbed of war like the recent Hitler Germany.
    In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the Western European bourgeois newspapers also condemned a very naive trick that the participants in the Washington conference came up with. For example, British Labor Party member Crossman wrote in the "Sunday Pictorial": "Molotov was invited to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held at the end of September to discuss the German issue; but he was told in advance that no matter what suggestions he made, the Western three countries would not revoke their decision to rearm West Germany. In fact, our response to the Kremlin's peace proposal is such a cold proposal: the Russians withdraw from their occupation zone and let a unified, rearmed Germany become a formal member of the Atlantic Defense Group." Crossman emphasized that raising the issue in this way would only undermine the negotiations. Then, in conclusion, he said:
    "In my opinion, this is precisely the reason why the issue is raised in this way. Dulles did not want to hold such a meeting but had to hold it, so he had to carefully devise a way to ensure the failure of this meeting in advance."
    Western European newspapers do not hide that the American conveners of the Washington conference did not really want to solve the German issue. They want to talk a lot about the German issue just to divert the attention of the German people, to make them believe that the American ruling group and their lackey Adenauer are, as they say, defending German interests, and they want to consolidate the shaky position of the Adenauer group in this way.
    All of this shows that the Washington communique does not stem from a demand to resolve the German issue, but from the American ruling group's purposeful desire to maintain the Adenauer regime and to collude with the Adenauer group to ensure that all the material and human resources of West Germany are used for aggressive purposes.
    American propaganda used to frighten the French with the so-called "Soviet threat," trying to get the French to agree to establish a "European Army," but today no one believes in this myth anymore. It is no accident that Dulles dared not use this hackneyed, deceptive argument again in his television broadcast to the nation on July 17. He said that it was deeply regrettable that measures had been delayed in taking "such a necessary step" in forming the "European Defense Community," that is, in establishing the so-called "European Army."
    Dulles said: "The parliaments of various countries have disappointingly delayed taking this step. Some people seem to think that the European Defense Community has no other purpose than to deal with the Soviet threat, so if this threat is eliminated, this community is not necessary." In contrast, Dulles is now trying to explain that "the basic reason why Europe must unite is that disunity has been the root cause of wars between European countries for one hundred and fifty years."
    From all this, it can be seen that the United States is stepping up pressure, hoping to accelerate the establishment of a "European Army" headed by the German "Defense Force." Since it is no longer possible to say anything about the "threat" from the Soviet Union, the United States has hastily come up with new reasons to stimulate Western European parliaments to pass the establishment of this army.
    It is also for this reason that they are trying to strengthen Adenauer's already weakened position in West Germany. It is also in this regard that everyone can clearly see why the Washington conference wants to conduct discussions on the German issue, although they refuse to discuss the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany, refuse to take practical measures to form an all-German government, and refuse to take measures to ensure that Germany returns to unification without delay.
        On the one hand, the Washington conference advocated a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, and such a meeting could have great positive value under certain conditions. On the other hand, they hope to use this Four-Power representatives' meeting to achieve purposes that have nothing in common with strengthening peace or easing international tensions. The huge distance between the verbal statements of the participants in the Washington conference and their real plans has been completely exposed.
    So, what does the Washington Conference tell us?
    This conference tells us that now no one can deny the urgent need to resolve pressing international issues through consultation.
    At the same time, the Washington conference and the communique issued after the meeting show that there are still great obstacles on the road to reaching a real agreement between the countries concerned to resolve these issues.
    Overcoming these obstacles and helping to ease international tensions – this is the task at hand.

    华盛顿会议告诉我们什么
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
    美、英、法三国外交部长历时五天的会议已于几天前在华盛顿结束。与会者在他们的最后公报中说，他们谋求足以满足“他们的政府与人民对和平、自由与正义所怀抱的共同希望”的解决办法。但是，会议的结果说明，这些关于和平、自由与正义的谈论是用来达到完全另外一种目的的。
    华盛顿公报说明，三国外长会议对于任何国际争执中的问题的解决并无帮助。在关于朝鲜停战和对中华人民共和国的态度问题上，人们不得不指出，英国代表萨利斯柏利和法国外长皮杜尔向杜勒斯的压力让步了。萨利斯柏利和皮杜尔事实上已经同意，如果美国军方的傀儡、冒险家李承晚认为宜于阻碍停战并发动另一次冒险时，他们将予以支持。同时，英法两国违背它们自己的切身利益，同意在朝鲜停战后继续实施对中国的贸易封锁，并阻挠联合国接纳中华人民共和国。
    同时，必须指出，华盛顿三国外长会议是在美国与其盟国相互间存在着分歧、而且矛盾日益尖锐的气氛中举行的。这首先就表现在使三国外长感到苦恼的一个主要问题上，这个问题就是：在人们日益普遍地迫切要求通过协商方式解决国际争端和缓和国际紧张局势的情况下，西方国家应该采取什么态度。由于苏联一贯的和平外交政策正在逐渐消除国际合作的敌人对于国际悬案的解决所设下的一切障碍，人们的这种要求已越来越强烈。
    华盛顿三国外长会谈中没有苏联代表参加这个事实告诉了我们什么呢？这个事实首先告诉我们，这次会议的参与者不愿意遵守起码的国际规则和标准。假如美国、英国、法国政府真是愿意与苏联政府讨论种种国际问题的话，那么按照通常的国际标准，是有正常的途径可循的。在四国会议以前，三国的代表进行共谋，甚至企图把在没有四国之一参与下、并背着四国之一所通过的举行四国会议的时间和议程，强加在随后举行的四国会议上，像这样的事情是没有人会认为是正常的。
    以这样的程序来准备四国会议，是很难被认为是正常的。也很难认为，英国和法国在四国代表会议一旦举行的时候，不会发现它们因此而已受到束缚。
    美国报纸指出，国务卿杜勒斯打算说服英国和法国的代表，要他们搁置关于举行会谈的主张，假如他们不愿完全放弃这个主张的话。杜勒斯并打算说服英国和法国代表加紧进行臭名远扬的美国“冷战”，也就是仿效外国雇佣者六月十七日在柏林所发动的挑衅的样子，执行对民主阵营各国进行破坏活动、冒险与挑衅的政策。
    从报纸的报道来看，可以知道，萨利斯柏利和皮杜尔对于这个要求的答复是：假如他们放弃四国会谈的主张，并遵循美国所建议的方针的话，他们的政府就会发现自己处于困难的境地，因为美国的方针正在他们国内遭到越来越激烈的反抗。他们说，邱吉尔之所以提出立刻举行有苏联参加的“最高级会议”来讨论并解决国际争执问题的建议，是出于对国际局势的清醒的估计，并且是为了回答西欧国家广大阶层人民的要求。他们不得不承认，要对人民这种要求置之不理，并在这个问题上继续奉行亲美政策的话，就会使得西欧内部发生最严重的困难。
    甚至有势力的美国企业界的报纸“华尔街日报”也不得不承认，“英国和法国官员似乎有这种普遍的感觉，就是他们的人民希望举行一次会议——人民坚持要这样——因此除非举行这样一次会议，不然他们不仅在具体的冷战行动中不能有所成就，而且还会在选举中被赶下台”。这家报纸承认这一点，并不是偶然的。
    该报说，这种种论点使杜勒斯不得不同意举行有苏联参加的四国会谈，虽然他曾经用了“他所有的论点”来反对这个建议。
    因此，美国、英国、法国统治集团之所以迫不得已向广大人民的要求——他们同意并支持以协商方式来解决悬而未决的国际问题的要求——让步，并不是因为他们爱好和平，而是因为他们担心他们的目的在反对国际合作的政策会完全暴露。
    不过，美国外交官在同意了向公众的要求作这种让步以后，却又在他们的英国及法国伙伴支持下，尽一切力量来利用刚在华盛顿作出的决定，不是为了真正解决极其主要的国际问题，而是为了他们自己的某种目的，这种目的是与缓和国际紧张局势问题丝毫没有共同之处的。
    一向表达极端反动分子的意见的杜勒斯在这上面也在某种程度上达到了他的目的。在美国的压力下，英国及法国代表放弃了四国政治首脑举行广泛会谈的主张，这比起邱吉尔提出的、并得到英法舆论支持的建议来是后退了一步。
    华盛顿公报更说明了另一个比从前的态度后退了
    一步的地方。公报说明，他们企图要缩小四国会议的工作，把它仅限于讨论几个有关德国和奥地利的问题。从公报中可以得到这样的印象，就是华盛顿会议的参与者希望避而不谈缓和国际紧张局势这个主要问题，甚至认为有可能对这个问题置之不理。
    实际上说来，华盛顿会议与会者在这个问题上，只是重述了美、英、法三国早在一九五二年九月二十三日致苏联的声名狼藉的照会的内容。大家知道，在这个照会中，它们像以前一样，又一次无望地企图缩小德国问题的范围，把整个事情缩小为举行全德选举问题，西方国家就是计划要控制这种选举，并藉此使德国各地所有的反动分子，甚至是法西斯分子能畅所欲为。公报的起草者所说的话让人清楚地看到，六月十七日的柏林冒险事件的结果又使这种眼光短浅的打算出现了，在这次柏林冒险事件中，用去不少美元，都是从那笔专门用来资助各种各样的破坏活动、间谍活动、恐怖活动与罪行的一亿美元款项中支付的。
    华盛顿会议参与者假装他们希望在四大国外长会议上研究德国问题和奥地利问题。但是事实上，华盛顿的公报一点没有证明他们将努力来使这些迫切的问题迅速获得解决。
    例如，华盛顿会议参与者的确讨论过德国问题，但是根本不是为了要帮助解决这方面有关的主要问题。他们一点也没有提到，由于美国、英国和法国的过错，关于对德和约的问题不仅拖到现在还没有解决，就是连审议也没有好好进行过。它们满口大谈关于德国统一的问题，但是很明显，华盛顿会议并不希望德国统一或者早日组成一个全德政府。就像一九五二年和以前几年一样，它们又把这个问题缩小为就全德选举举行新谈判，这样一来，便可能把解决有关对德和约的问题以及把德国人民统一在一个国家里的问题拖延下去。
    对于它们说来，这似乎不是也不能是一个早日统
    一德国和缔结对德和约的问题，因为对它们说来，德国问题首先在于加强阿登纳集团在西德的统治地位，在那里也许这个集团的日子已屈指可数了。它们不能不看到，西德人民情绪的改变不利于阿登纳和他的法西斯报复主义集团，社会民主党人可能在明天代替阿登纳的位置。它们的问题是：怎样支持和加强为美国战争努力效劳、并且越来越遭到德国人民痛恨的阿登纳之流的统治。
    九月六日，波恩共和国将举行议会选举，在选举中，西德人民可能把阿登纳集团赶出政府。因此，阿登纳的保护者必须忙起来了。现在已经到了这样的地步，甚至法国外交部长也不得不在华盛顿签字，表明他将支持阿登纳集团，虽然这个集团存在的全部意义就是德国军国主义的复活以及以种种办法重新建立一支希特勒“国防军”。
    公报中公开强调三国将继续努力实行建立“欧洲军”的计划，这并不是偶然的。这个计划规定西德重新军国主义化，并使西德加入北大西洋侵略集团。另一方面，大家知道，美国正在竭力争取各国批准的波恩条约规定，如果德国实现统一，它要承担西德政府的所有国际义务，其中自然包括关于参加“欧洲军”的义务。
    谁都知道，这些计划的目的是要使德国重新成为一个军国主义国家，使德国军队成为“欧洲军”的骨干，成为北大西洋侵略联盟的突击军队。如果这些计划得以实现，每个人都知道，那就等于在中欧解除对于一支最好战的军国主义力量的束缚，并复活像不久前的希特勒德国一样的战争温床。
    在这方面值得提到的是，西欧资产阶级报纸也谴责华盛顿会议的参与者想出的一个很幼稚的花样。例如，英国工党党员克罗斯曼在“星期日画报”上写道：“莫洛托夫被邀参加在九月底举行的外长会议，讨论德国问题；但是又预先告诉他，无论他提出什么建议，西方三国还是不会撤销它们重新武装西德的决定。事实上，我们对于克里姆林和平建议的答复是这样一个冰冷的建议：俄国人撤出他们的占领区，让一个统一的、重新武装的德国成为大西洋防务集团的正式会员国。”克罗斯曼强调指出，这样提出问题只会破坏谈判。接着，他在结语中说：
    “在我看来，这正是问题这样提出的原因。杜勒斯不希望举行但又不得不举行这样一个会议，所以他只好处心积虑地事先设法使这个会议保证失败。”
    西欧报纸并不掩饰，华盛顿会议的美国召集者事实上并不想真正解决德国问题。他们要大谈其德国问题，只是想转移德国人民的注意，使他们相信美国统治集团和他们的走狗阿登纳是如他们所说那样在保卫德国的利益，他们想这样来巩固阿登纳集团摇摇欲坠的地位。
    这一切都说明，华盛顿公报不是出于要求解决德国问题，而是由于美国统治集团有目的地要维持阿登纳政权，并与阿登纳集团串通一气，确使西德的全部物质和人力资源用于侵略目的。
    美国的宣传以前曾以所谓“苏联威胁”来吓唬法国人，试图使法国人同意建立“欧洲军”，而今天不再有任何人相信这种神话了。杜勒斯七月十七日在向全国作电视广播时不敢再用这种陈腐的、骗人的论据了，这不是偶然的。他说，在组成“欧洲防务集团”“这样一个必要的步骤”上，也就是在成立所谓“欧洲军”这件事上，迟迟没有采取措施，是令人深为遗憾的。
    杜勒斯说：“各国议会令人失望地迟迟未能采取这个步骤。某些人似乎认为欧洲防务集团除了应付苏联的威胁以外，没有其它的目的了，所以，假如这种威胁消除的话，这个集团就没有必要了。”与此相反，杜勒斯现在设法说明“欧洲所以要团结在一起的基本原因是：一百五十年以来，不团结一直是欧洲各国间战争的根源”。
    从所有这些可以看出，美国正加紧施用压力，希望加速建立一个以德国“国防军”为首的“欧洲军”。由于不可能再说什么苏联的“威胁”，美国仓促想出了新的理由来刺激西欧议会通过建立这支军队。
    也就是为了这个原因，他们又企图要加强阿登纳在西德的已经削弱的地位。也正是在这方面，大家可以明显看出为什么华盛顿会议要进行德国问题的讨论，虽然它们拒绝讨论准备对德和约问题，拒绝采取实际措施来组成全德政府，拒绝采取措施来确使德国毫不迟延地重归统一。
        一方面，华盛顿会议主张苏联、美国、英国和法国外长举行会议，而这种会议在一定的条件下是可能有很大的积极价值的。另一方面，他们希望利用这个四国代表会议来达到与加强和平或缓和国际紧张局势毫无共同之处的目的。华盛顿会议与会者的口头声明与他们的真正计划之间的巨大距离已经完全暴露了。
    那么，华盛顿会议告诉了我们什么呢？
    这次会议告诉我们，现在任何人都不再能够否认经由协商来解决紧急的国际问题的迫切需要了。
    同时华盛顿会议和会后发表的公报说明：在有关各国达成真正协议以解决这些问题的道路上仍有很大的障碍。
    克服这些障碍，帮助缓和国际紧张局势——这就是任务所在。
