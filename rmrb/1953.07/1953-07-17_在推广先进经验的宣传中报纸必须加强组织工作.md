    In Promoting Advanced Experience, Newspapers Must Strengthen Organizational Work

    Economic construction reports in newspapers should pay attention to promoting advanced experiences. As collective propagandists, mobilizers, and organizers, newspapers should not only actively publicize those advanced experiences that are fully mature, but also, through their own activities of connecting with reality and connecting with the masses, keenly discover new advanced experiences. After relevant leading organs and technical personnel have researched and deemed them feasible for promotion, the newspapers should enthusiastically help them grow, improve, and be popularized. In the past year, some newspapers have already explored some experiences in this area. Among them, the organizational and mass work conducted by the *Shenyang Daily* in promoting advanced experiences in capital construction and red brick manufacturing is worth introducing.

    Since May of last year, the *Shenyang Daily* has effectively publicized and promoted advanced experiences such as the sectional parallel flow operation method in red brick manufacturing and civil engineering construction, the three-stage division of labor flow operation method in design work, and construction organization design. However, some of these advanced experiences did not appear in a complete form before the editorial department, and were not initially in a condition to be publicized and promoted in the newspaper. On the contrary, some advanced experiences were discovered by the editorial department through the leadership organs' and their own in-depth investigation and research. Some advanced experiences were promoted only after close contact with reality, mass-related propaganda work, and organizational work. The newspaper's promotion of advanced experience in red brick manufacturing is a prominent example. In May of last year, it was already the busy season for construction, but the supply of red bricks in Shenyang City was far behind the needs of construction, which caused certain difficulties in construction. After the *Shenyang Daily* learned of this situation from the leading organs, it sent reporters to the brickyards to find out whether potential power could still be brought into play in red brick production. Through investigation and research, it was found that the irrational labor organization and the backward "two-linked bucket" blanking method and kiln firing operation method were relatively common in the city's brick industry. This made it impossible for red brick production to meet the requirements in terms of both quantity and quality. Based on this situation, the newspaper's editorial department actively sought ways to improve red brick production. Through further investigation and research, it was discovered that a group at the fourth site of Shenyang Kiln Industry Factory No. 1 had implemented a division of labor method that could improve labor organization, and that the private Deyuan Kiln Industry Factory had relatively complete operating methods for improving quality in stacking kilns, firing kilns, and removing kilns. At that time, the "Labor Daily" in Northeast China introduced the Fushun Kiln Industry's "three-linked bucket" blanking method which could increase production. After discovering these budding advanced experiences, the *Shenyang Daily*, in order to clarify whether these experiences were practical, consulted with kiln workers and cadres, and organized symposiums to study and affirm these experiences. Finally, it was determined to promote these three simultaneously in order to improve the production of red bricks in terms of quantity and quality. Subsequently, it continuously reported on this in a prominent position in the newspaper. Thanks to the coordination and promotion of the newspaper propaganda, and with the support and promotion of the Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau, this advanced experience was promoted in more than 80% of the brickyards in Shenyang City, promoting a 30% increase in red brick production, and increasing first-class products from the original 10% to 20% to 50%, thereby helping to solve the red brick supply problem in capital construction at that time.

    The *Shenyang Daily*'s promotion of advanced experience in design work is another more prominent example. In January of this year, the newspaper learned from practical work departments that design work was lagging behind the requirements of construction, which brought serious difficulties to the preparatory work for capital construction. For example, some construction units could not submit financial plans and material plans because the design work had not been completed; some construction units had to blindly import materials to the construction site because they had not received the general layout plan of the construction site, and if the design drawings were determined in the future, there would inevitably be a waste of "materials relocation." The newspaper clearly realized from various investigations and research that accelerating the design work on the basis of ensuring quality and implementing economic accounting is an important issue in the current preparatory work for capital construction; the newspaper should grasp this main contradiction in the current work and go deep into the masses to seek ways to solve this contradiction. After affirming the three-stage division of labor flow operation method (originally advanced Soviet experience), the review system, and the active collection of design materials implemented by the former Northeast Industrial Department Design Company and the Machinery Bureau Design Office, the newspaper adopted the method of having the creators of advanced experience meet with the representatives of the promotion department and organized exchange meetings to promote them. Through the lively discussion of the exchange meeting, the promotion unit can not only learn these advanced experiences more directly and effectively, but also enrich and complete the content of the advanced experience. The newspaper successively introduced these advanced experiences and published a commentary "We must seize the time and complete the design work ahead of schedule," pointing out that learning and promoting advanced experiences is an important method to improve design efficiency. The advanced experience in design work introduced by the newspaper was quickly valued by many units such as the Design Company of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, the Electrical Engineering Bureau, and the Design Office of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau. Learning and promotion were organized in these units, effectively helping them improve design efficiency.

    In promoting advanced experience, the *Shenyang Daily* not only pays attention to close contact with the masses, but also pays attention to close contact with the leading organs, actively puts forward suggestions, and requests relevant leading organs to review and study them. If it is considered indeed feasible for promotion, it actively seeks their help and support. This is an extremely important factor for advanced experience to be discovered and promoted in a timely manner. For example, when the newspaper promoted the sectional parallel flow operation method in civil engineering construction in September last year and the construction organization design in April this year, it reported the results of the newspaper's investigation and research in detail to the leading organs and suggested that the leading organs convene a symposium to promote them. As the newspaper pointed out when summarizing its experience in this area, when publicizing and promoting advanced experience, the newspaper should take the initiative to ask the leading organs for instructions, consult, report the situation, and put forward opinions based on its own investigation. After obtaining the consent and support of the relevant leading organs, the newspaper can vigorously publicize and organize promotion, so that the newspaper's publicity can closely cooperate with the relevant departments' promotion work and achieve good promotion results.

    The practice of the *Shenyang Daily* in promoting advanced experience vividly proves that our newspapers should not only be recorders and commentators of social life, but also active organizers and propagandists of new things. It is precisely because the *Shenyang Daily* has brought into play this initiative and proactiveness that the newspaper does not passively wait for the emergence of advanced experience, but proactively discovers emerging things from the connection with reality and the connection with the masses, and adopts the method of "from the masses, to the masses" to help and promote relevant departments to promote the growth, improvement, and popularization of emerging things, thereby effectively bringing into play the role of the newspaper as a "collective organizer" in economic construction. However, the *Shenyang Daily* still has shortcomings in this area. That is: the propaganda of advanced experience in the newspaper is not concentrated and powerful enough, and the mass work is not closely integrated with the reporting. It should be pointed out that the editorial department's mass work is the foundation of newspaper work and the main method to enrich and improve the content of the newspaper, so the phenomenon of conducting mass work in isolation should be prevented. The *Shenyang Daily* and newspapers in various places should pay attention to preventing this disconnection.

### 在推广先进经验的宣传中报纸必须加强组织工作

专栏：报纸工作述评

    在推广先进经验的宣传中报纸必须加强组织工作
    报纸的经济建设报道，应注意宣传推广先进经验。作为集体的宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的报纸，不仅应该积极地宣传那些已经完全成熟的先进经验，而且应该通过自己联系实际、联系群众的活动，敏锐地发现新的先进经验，在经过有关领导机关和技术人员研究认为可以推行后，即热情地帮助它成长、提高和推广。近一年来，有些报纸已经在这一方面摸索出一些经验，其中沈阳日报在推广基本建设和制造红砖先进经验中所进行的组织工作和群众工作，是值得介绍的。
    沈阳日报从去年五月以来，曾经有效地宣传和推广了制造红砖、土木建筑中的分段平行流水作业法、设计工作的三段分工流水作业法和施工组织设计等先进经验。但是其中有些先进经验并不是以完备的姿态出现在编辑部的面前，不是一开始就具备了在报纸上宣传推广的条件的。恰恰相反，有的先进经验是编辑部通过领导机关和自己的深入调查研究才被发现出来，有的先进经验是经过密切联系实际联系群众的宣传工作和组织工作以后，才得到推广的。该报对于制造红砖先进经验的推广，就是一个突出的例子。去年五月已是施工的紧张季节，可是当时沈阳市的红砖供应远远落后于施工的需要，因而造成了施工上的一定困难。沈阳日报从领导机关得到这一情况后，就派记者深入窑厂去了解，在红砖生产方面是否还可以发挥潜在力量。经过调查研究，发现该市窑业中比较普遍地存在着不合理的劳动组织和落后的“二联斗”扣坯法及烧窑操作法，这就使得红砖的生产不仅在数量上而且在质量上都不能达到应有的要求。该报编辑部根据这种情况，积极地寻求提高红砖生产的途径。经过进一步的调查研究，发现沈阳窑业一厂第四现场的一个小组曾经实行过可以改善劳动组织的分工方法，私营德远窑业工厂在码窑、烧窑、出窑方面有比较完整的提高质量的操作方法，而当时东北“劳动日报”上介绍的抚顺窑业的“三联斗”扣坯法可以提高产量。沈阳日报在发现了这些萌芽的先进经验后，为了明确这些经验是否切合实际，就向窑业工人和干部请教，并组织座谈会来研究，肯定了这些经验，最后确定把这三者同时集中推广，以使红砖的生产在产量和质量方面都得到提高；接着并在报纸上连续以显著的地位进行了报道。由于报纸宣传的配合和推动，在市人民政府企业局的支持和推广下，这一先进经验在沈阳市百分之八十以上的窑厂得到推广，促进红砖产量提高了百分之三十，一等产品由原来的百分之十到百分之二十提高到百分之五十，从而帮助解决了当时基本建设中的红砖供应问题。
    沈阳日报对于设计工作先进经验的推广，是另一个较为突出的例子。今年一月该报从实际工作部门中，了解到由于设计工作落后于施工的要求，因而给基本建设准备工作带来严重的困难。例如有的施工单位因为设计工作没有完成，提不出财务计划和材料计划；有的施工单位因为没有拿到施工总平面配置图，不得不向工地盲目进料，将来设计图纸确定后，势必出现“材料大搬家”的浪费现象。该报从多方面的调查研究中明确地认识到：使设计工作在保证质量、贯彻经济核算的基础上加快进行，是当前基本建设准备工作中的重要问题；报纸应该抓住当前工作中的这一主要矛盾，并深入到群众中去求得解决这一矛盾的方法。该报在肯定了原东北工业部设计公司和机械局设计处所实行的三段分工流水作业法（原系苏联先进经验）、会审制度和主动搜集设计资料等先进经验后，就采取先进经验创造者和推广部门代表会面的方式，组织交流会来进行推广。经过交流会的生动活泼的讨论，推广单位不但可以更为直接有效地学习这些先进经验，而且可以使先进经验的内容更为丰富、完整。报纸陆续介绍了这些先进经验，并发表评论“必须争取时间，提前完成设计工作”，指出学习与推广先进经验是提高设计效率的重要方法。为报纸所介绍的设计工作先进经验，很快地受到沈阳市建筑工程局设计公司、电工局、有色金属局设计处等许多单位的重视，在这些单位组织了学习和推广，有效地帮助他们提高了设计效率。
    沈阳日报在推广先进经验中，不仅注意到密切联系群众，而且注意到密切联系领导机关，主动地提出建议，请求有关领导机关加以审查研究，如果被认为确实可以推行，便积极地取得他们的帮助和支持。这是先进经验能够及时发现和得到推广的一个极其重要的因素。例如该报去年九月推广土木建筑中的分段平行流水作业法和今年四月推广施工组织设计时，都曾将报社调查研究的结果详细向领导机关汇报，并建议领导机关召开座谈会进行推广。正如该报在总结这一方面的经验时所指出，报纸在宣传推广先进经验时，应主动向领导机关请示、磋商、报告情况，根据自己的调查所得提出意见。在得到有关领导机关的同意和支持后，报纸就可以大力宣传和组织推广，这样才能使报纸的宣传与有关部门的推广工作密切配合，取得良好的推广效果。
    沈阳日报推广先进经验的作法，生动地证明了：我们的报纸不应该只是社会生活的记录者和评论者，还应该是新鲜事物的积极的组织者和宣传者。正因为沈阳日报发挥了这种主动性和积极性，所以该报并不是消极地等待先进经验的出现，而是从联系实际联系群众中主动地去发现新生的事物，并采取“从群众中来，到群众中去”的方法，帮助和推动有关部门促使新生的事物成长、提高和普及，从而有效地发挥了报纸在经济建设方面的“集体的组织者”的作用。但是沈阳日报在这一方面仍然是有缺点的。那就是：报纸上关于先进经验的宣传不够集中有力，没有作到群众工作与报道的更紧密的结合。应该指出：编辑部的群众工作是报纸工作的基础，是丰富和改善报纸内容的主要方法，因而应该防止孤立地进行群众工作的现象。沈阳日报以及各地报纸都应注意防止这种脱节现象。
