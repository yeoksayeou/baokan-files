    Comrades,
    We are holding this celebration meeting today to celebrate the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This is a great victory for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in their heroic struggle, and also a great victory for the people of Korea and China and all peace-loving people in the world. This victory proves that the people's peace forces can defeat aggressive forces; this victory proves that all international disputes should be resolved through consultation, and can be resolved through consultation.
    As everyone remembers, back in November 1950, China's democratic parties issued a joint declaration for resisting America and aiding Korea. The declaration stated: "The Chinese people ardently love peace. We have always wanted peace in the past, and we will always want peace in the future. We want peace for China, we want peace for Asia, and we want lasting peace for the whole world and all mankind. We advocate that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully, and that the imperialist aggressor troops should withdraw from Korea. However, the American imperialists and their accomplices are not only unwilling to withdraw their invading troops, stop the war of aggression, and resolve the Korean issue peacefully, but are instead frantically developing this war of aggression north of the '38th parallel,' towards the Yalu River and Tumen River on the Chinese border. This has forced us to recognize the fact that if peace-loving people in the world want to achieve peace, they must take active action to resist violence and stop aggression. Only by resisting can it be possible to teach the imperialists a lesson, and only then can the issues of independence and liberation in Korea and other regions be resolved fairly according to the will of the people." Comrades! Now the just demands of the Chinese people have been realized. We can achieve this great victory, and we must thank the heroic and battle-hardened Chinese People's Volunteers, we must thank the support of the people of the whole country, we must thank the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and we must thank the assistance of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Our victory should especially be attributed to the heroes who died heroically on the Korean battlefield; it is their blood that has safeguarded the security of the motherland and safeguarded world peace. Their achievements will be immortal!
    Comrades! Reaching an agreement on the Korean armistice negotiations is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Stubborn warmongers are still conspiring to undermine the armistice and disrupt the political conference. In order to ensure the implementation of the armistice agreement and to strive for the success of the political conference, we must continue to work hard and we must remain vigilant. We must solemnly announce to the world: if anyone dares to undermine the armistice and disrupt peace, we will definitely continue to fight alongside the Korean people for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue!
    Long live the victory of the Korean and Chinese people!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Korean and Chinese people!
    Long live world peace!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    
    Speech by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    Dear Comrades:
    The Korean armistice that the people of the world have longed for has now been realized. The Korean Armistice Agreement, which took more than two years of negotiations to reach, was signed at Panmunjom at 10:00 a.m. on July 27th. Twelve hours after the signing of the armistice agreement, both sides ceased all hostile acts and implemented a ceasefire. We, the Chinese people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, warmly support the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and will continue to work to implement all the provisions of this armistice agreement and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.
    The realization of the Korean armistice is the result of the great efforts of the people and governments of Korea and China. From the very beginning of the Korean War, the governments of Korea and China, and the world peace fortress - the Soviet Union, as well as the people's democratic countries, firmly advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and have unswervingly struggled to achieve this goal. The reason why we Chinese people launched the great movement to resist America and aid Korea was to enable the Korean issue to be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. Thanks to the initiative of the Soviet government, the Korean armistice negotiations began in July 1951. Throughout the negotiation process, the Korean and Chinese sides, based on their consistent advocacy of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and disregarding the repeated obstruction and delay by the US side, always insisted on negotiations, and with a spirit of sincere consultation, made the greatest possible concessions. Only then were the conspiracies of some warmongering elements on the US side to undermine the armistice overcome, and each agenda item of the negotiation was agreed upon, and the Korean armistice was finally realized.
    The realization of the Korean armistice is also the result of the joint efforts of all peace-loving people in the world. As the peace proposals of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp have become increasingly popular, and as the anti-aggression struggle of the Korean and Chinese people has been victorious, the scale of the world peace movement has become wider and wider. Tens of millions of people from all walks of life in various countries have united under the banner of defending peace. They saw that the Korean War was a serious threat not only to peace in the Far East, but also to world peace. They warmly supported the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and demanded an end to the Korean War. The people of the United States, the people of Britain, and the people of many other countries that sent troops to invade Korea demanded that their governments quickly end the Korean War and let their husbands and sons return home. The strong call of the people of the world for peace in Korea contributed to the realization of the Korean armistice.
    The realization of the Korean armistice is particularly the result of the heroic joint operations of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who achieved a great victory in their just struggle against the American-led aggressors. In the three years of the Korean War, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers grew stronger and stronger, and gained rich experience in fighting against the invading forces. After three years of heroic battles, the Korean and Chinese people's armies have driven the invaders back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel and eliminated more than one million enemy troops.
    The realization of the Korean armistice proves that peace can triumph over war, and that international disputes can and must be resolved through consultation. There is no doubt that all peace-loving people and governments in the world who are willing to maintain peace will cheer for the Korean armistice, and the world's struggle for peace will be even more heightened by the encouragement of the Korean armistice.
    Comrades, at the time of the signing of this Korean Armistice Agreement, we Chinese people must especially thank the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, our most beloved people—all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Many of them have already dedicated their glorious lives, and many have been wounded. We and our children and grandchildren will never forget their great contributions. We must also thank the male and female stretcher bearers, transport team members, railway transportation workers, rear service workers, medical and health workers, and battlefield cultural workers who participated in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. In order to support the Korean people's anti-aggression struggle and to defend our great motherland, they overcame all kinds of difficulties and fought selflessly and relentlessly. Because of their heroic sacrifices and hard work, we can be at ease to build our great motherland and live a happy life. We express our deep condolences and boundless respect to the martyrs who bravely sacrificed in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. We extend our cordial greetings to the comrades who were gloriously wounded for resisting America and aiding Korea, and we extend our supreme respect and heartfelt thanks to all the commanders and fighters of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and all the staff on all fronts of resisting America and aiding Korea.
    Comrades, in the three years of the Korean War, the Chinese people and the heroic Korean people forged the closest internationalist friendship. We shed blood together for our common security and common ideals. In the struggle to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the Chinese people, the Korean people, the great Soviet people, and the people of all countries in the peace and democracy camp have always been firmly united. Let us pay tribute to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army led by Marshal Kim Il-sung! May the friendly unity of the people of all countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union last forever!
    The Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, but this does not mean that all the provisions of this agreement can be implemented without hindrance, and that the Korean issue has been peacefully resolved. In order to ensure that all the provisions of the armistice agreement are implemented rather than undermined, and in order for the political conference after the armistice to achieve the goal of peacefully resolving the Korean issue, we must continue to make great efforts. Those who hate peace will try everything possible to undermine peace. The Syngman Rhee clique has always openly clamored against the armistice. They make no secret of their ambition to continue the war and use force to "unify Korea." And a small group of powerful military and political figures in the United States also make no secret of their support for Syngman Rhee. Therefore, the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world must be seriously vigilant against the conspiracies of these peace breakers, and tirelessly strive for the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement and for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    Comrades! Our struggle is just, it is supported by the vast majority of mankind, and it cannot be stopped by any force. Therefore, we can firmly believe that no matter how many difficulties there are ahead, we will definitely achieve our goals in the end.
    Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed for the heroic cause of resisting America and aiding Korea!
    Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!
    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live world peace!

    Speech by Xu Zhe, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Korean Embassy in China
    Respected Chairman and Members of the Presidium! Comrades!
    The Korean Armistice Agreement, which the people of the whole world longed for, was signed at Panmunjom on July 27th, and all hostilities in Korea have completely ceased.
    This is a victory for the people of Korea and China, and a victory for the world's peace and democracy camp.
    Three years ago, the Korean people, in order to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland and world peace, took up the just guns and bravely launched a glorious struggle against aggression.
    In this way, the Korean people, firmly united around their respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung and the government of the Republic, with the spiritual and material warm assistance of the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union and China, won a brilliant victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War.
    In particular, the fraternal Chinese people, when the Korean people were in the most difficult period, in order to assist the Korean people, to defend the security of their own motherland and peace in the Far East and the world, bravely launched the great movement to resist America and aid Korea, and sent the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to the front lines in Korea.
    In this way, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army closely coordinated in combat, defeating the enemy to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, and inflicting heavy blows on the armed invaders and their running dog Syngman Rhee gang, forcing the enemy to accept the Korean armistice negotiations.
    The heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the so-called general offensive of the US imperialist aggressor forces after the start of the negotiations, victoriously smashed the enemy's aggressive attempts every time, stabilizing the battle line in the vicinity of the 38th parallel.
    Due to the victory of our armed forces and the consistent efforts of the people of Korea and China and the efforts of the people of the world, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, which is our victory.
    Today, through this celebration meeting, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to all the commanders and fighters of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. At the same time, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    I would like to express my heartfelt thanks and warm congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people and their leader Chairman Mao Zedong, who rose up under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea and sincerely assisted the Korean people.
    Dear comrades!
    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    However, the Syngman Rhee gang, with the open support of warmongers in the United States, is still opposing the Korean armistice.
    Therefore, we must constantly maintain high vigilance and, together with the people of the world, monitor whether the United States earnestly fulfills its obligations under the armistice agreement. If the Syngman Rhee gang dares to violate the armistice, then we must, as Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai have clearly stated in the ceasefire order, "maintain high vigilance, hold our positions, and prevent any attacks and sabotage from the other side."
    At the same time, at the upcoming higher-level political conference, the issue of the unification, independence, and democratic development of Korea must be resolved.
    We have always maintained that the Korean issue must be resolved on a fair and reasonable basis. That is to say, all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, must withdraw from Korea, and the Korean issue must be handled by the Korean people themselves.
    Therefore, the higher-level political conference must be convened on the basis of equal consultation. It must be conducive to the establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic new Korea. We must continue to strive to ensure that this higher-level political conference completes this task.
    Dear comrades!
    The Korean people must, with high vigilance, completely turn the heroism, tenacity, and lofty spirit of self-sacrifice that they displayed in the Fatherland Liberation War to the restoration and construction of cities, rural areas, factories, and enterprises that were destroyed by the armed aggression of the US imperialists.
    I believe that this work will be completed quickly with the support and assistance of the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union and China.
    The people of Korea and China will certainly work harder to consolidate and develop the militant friendship forged in blood. This friendship is indelible! No aggressive force can destroy it!
    Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!
    Long live the brave Chinese People's Volunteers!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity of the people of Korea and China!
    Eternal glory to the heroes of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who bravely sacrificed in the just war against aggression!
    Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people who sincerely assisted the Korean people!
    Long live Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, and the Soviet people who actively assisted the Korean people!
    Long live the solidarity and victory of the world's peace and democratic forces, headed by the Soviet Union!

    首都各界庆祝朝鲜停战协定签字大会
    人民政协全国委员会副主席
    陈叔通的开幕词同志们：
    我们今天开这个庆祝大会，庆祝朝鲜停战协定的签字。这是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军英勇斗争的伟大胜利，也是朝中两国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的伟大胜利。这个胜利证明了，人民的和平力量是能够战胜侵略力量的；这个胜利证明了一切国际间的争端，应当用协商的方法来解决，并且也能够用协商的方法来解决的。
    大家记得，还在一九五○年十一月间，我国各民主党派为了抗美援朝，曾经发表联合宣言。这个宣言中说：“中国人民是酷爱和平的。我们以前一向要和平，我们今后永远要和平。我们要中国的和平，我们要亚洲的和平，我们要全世界全人类的持久和平。我们主张朝鲜问题应当以和平方式来解决，帝国主义者的侵略军应当从朝鲜撤回去。然而美帝国主义者及其帮凶们不但不愿意撤退侵略军，停止侵略战争与以和平方式解决朝鲜问题，反而向‘三八’线以北，向中国的边境鸭绿江、图们江疯狂地发展这种侵略战争。这样就迫使我们认识了这样一个事实，那就是：世界上爱好和平的人民如果想要得到和平，就必须用积极行动来抵抗暴行，制止侵略。只有抵抗，才有可能使帝国主义者获得教训，才有可能按照人民的意志公正地解决朝鲜及其他地区的独立和解放的问题。”同志们！现在中国人民的正义主张实现了。我们能得到这个伟大的胜利，必须感谢英勇善战的中国人民志愿军，必须感谢全国人民的支持，必须感谢中国共产党和毛主席的领导，必须感谢以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的援助。我们的胜利，特别应当归功于在朝鲜战场上壮烈牺牲的英雄们，是他们的鲜血保卫了祖国的安全，保卫了世界的和平。他们的功绩永垂不朽！
    同志们！朝鲜停战谈判达成协议，这才是朝鲜问题和平解决的第一步。顽固的好战分子还在阴谋破坏停战，破坏政治会议。为了保障停战协定的实施，为了争取政治会议的成功，我们还应当继续努力，我们还应当提高警惕。我们要向全世界郑重宣布：如果有人敢于破坏停战，破坏和平，我们一定继续与朝鲜人民一道，为朝鲜问题的和平解决斗争到底！
    朝中人民胜利万岁！
    朝中人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席
    郭沫若的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    全世界人民渴望的朝鲜停战现在实现了。经过两年多的谈判才达成协议的朝鲜停战协定，已经在七月二十七日上午十时在板门店签订了。在停战协定签字之后十二小时，双方已经停止一切敌对行为，实行停火。我们中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，热烈拥护朝鲜停战协定的缔结，并且将为实现这个停战协定的全部条款，为和平解决朝鲜问题而继续努力。
    朝鲜停战的实现，是朝中两国人民和两国政府重大努力的结果。朝中两国政府和世界和平堡垒——苏联，以及各人民民主国家，从朝鲜战争一开始，就坚决主张和平解决朝鲜问题，并且坚持不渝地为实现这个主张而斗争。我们中国人民所以要展开伟大的抗美援朝运动，也就是为了使朝鲜问题能够早日和平解决。由于苏联政府的倡议，在一九五一年七月间开始了朝鲜停战谈判，在整个谈判过程中，朝中方面本着和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯主张，不顾美方的一再阻挠和拖延，始终坚持谈判，并且以诚意协商的精神，作了最大限度的忍让，这才战胜了美方某些好战分子的破坏停战的阴谋，使谈判的各项议程都获得了协议，朝鲜停战才终于实现。
    朝鲜停战的实现，同时是全世界爱好和平的人民共同努力的结果。随着和平、民主、社会主义阵营的和平主张日益深入人心，以及朝中人民反侵略斗争的胜利，世界和平运动的规模越来越广泛了。成万万的各国各阶层人民，在保卫和平的旗帜下团结了起来。他们看到：朝鲜战争不但对于远东和平，而且对于世界和平都是一个严重的威胁。他们热烈拥护和平解决朝鲜问题的主张，要求结束朝鲜战争。美国人民、英国人民和其他出兵侵略朝鲜的许多国家的人民，要求他们的政府迅速结束朝鲜战争，让他们的丈夫和儿子回家。全世界人民要求朝鲜和平的强烈的呼声，促成了朝鲜停战的实现。
    朝鲜停战的实现，特别是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩英勇作战，在反对以美国为首的侵略者的正义斗争中取得了伟大胜利的结果。在三年朝鲜战争中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军愈战愈强，取得了对侵略军队作战的丰富经验。朝中人民军队经过三年英勇的战斗，已经把侵略者打回三八线附近，并且消灭了敌军共达一百万人以上。
    朝鲜停战的实现，证明和平可以战胜战争，证明国际间的争端可以而且必须用协商的方法来解决。毫无疑问，全世界一切爱好和平的人民和愿意保持和平的政府都将要为朝鲜的停战而欢呼，全世界的争取和平的斗争将要因为朝鲜停战的鼓舞而更加高涨。
    同志们，在这朝鲜停战协定签订的时候，我们中国人民，特别要感谢我们中国人民的优秀儿女，我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员和战斗员。他们中间许多人已经献出了他们光荣的生命，许多人负了伤，他们的伟大的贡献，我们和我们的子子孙孙将永远不能忘记。我们也要感谢参加抗美援朝斗争的男女担架队员们、运输队员们、铁路交通工作人员们、后方勤务工作人员们、医疗卫生工作人员们、战地文化工作人员们。他们为了支援朝鲜人民的反侵略斗争，为了保卫我们伟大的祖国，克服了种种困难，作了忘我的前仆后继的斗争。由于他们的英勇牺牲，艰苦奋斗，才使我们能够安心地建设我们伟大的祖国，过着幸福的生活。我们向在抗美援朝的斗争中英勇牺牲的烈士们，谨致深切的悼念和无限的敬意。我们向为抗美援朝而光荣负伤的同志们，谨致亲切的慰问，并向英勇的中国人民志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员，以及在抗美援朝的各个战线上的全体工作人员，谨致崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    同志们，在朝鲜战争的三年中，中国人民和英勇的朝鲜人民结成了最亲密的国际主义的友谊，我们为了共同的安全和共同的理想而在一起流了血。在争取朝鲜问题和平解决的斗争中，中国人民、朝鲜人民和伟大的苏联人民，和和平民主阵营各国的人民，始终坚固地团结在一起。让我们向金日成元帅所领导的英勇的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军致敬！祝以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国人民的友好团结万岁！
    朝鲜停战协定签订了，但是，这并不等于说，这个协定的全部条款就可以毫无阻碍地得到实现，朝鲜问题就已经得到了和平的解决。为了使停战协定的全部条款得到实现而不是遭到破坏，为了使停战以后的政治会议达到和平解决朝鲜问题的目的，我们还必须继续作重大的努力。仇视和平的人还会想尽一切办法来破坏和平。李承晚集团始终公开叫嚣反对停战。他们毫不掩饰他们的继续战争、用武力
    “统一朝鲜”的野心。而美国的一小群有势力的军政人物，也毫不掩饰他们对于李承晚的支持。因此，中朝人民和全世界人民必须严重警惕这些和平破坏者的阴谋，不倦地为停战协定的彻底实现而奋斗，为朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗。
    同志们！我们的奋斗是正义的，是得到全人类最大多数支持的，是没有任何力量能够阻止的。因此，我们可以坚决相信，无论前面还有多少困难，我们最后一定能够达到目的。
    为抗美援朝的英雄事业而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中朝两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    朝鲜驻中国大使馆临时代办
    徐哲的讲话敬爱的主席同志和主席团诸位！诸位同志们！
    全世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战协定已在七月二十七日在板门店签字，在朝鲜的一切敌对行为已完全停止。
    这是朝中两国人民的胜利，是全世界和平民主阵营的胜利。
    在三年以前，朝鲜人民为了保卫自己祖国的独立自由和世界的和平，拿起正义的枪杆奋起进行了反侵略的光荣斗争。
    这样，朝鲜人民巩固地团结在敬爱的领袖金日成元帅和共和国政府的周围，在以苏联和中国为首的全世界爱好和平人民的精神和物质上的热诚援助下，在伟大的祖国解放战争过程中，争取了辉煌的胜利。
    特别是，兄弟般的中国人民，当朝鲜人民处在最困难的时期，为了援助朝鲜人民，为了保卫自己祖国的安全和远东及世界的和平，奋起展开了伟大的抗美援朝运动，把由自己的优秀儿女所组成的中国人民志愿军派遣到朝鲜前线。
    这样，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军紧密地协同作战，把敌人击溃到三八线附近，给武装侵犯者及其走狗李承晚匪帮以惨重的打击，使敌人被迫接受朝鲜停战谈判。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在谈判开始后的美帝国主义侵略军的所谓总攻势里面，每次都胜利地粉碎了敌人的侵略企图，使战线在三八线附近稳定下来。
    由于我们武装力量的胜利和朝中两国人民的一贯努力和全世界人民的努力，朝鲜停战协定获得签订，这是我们的胜利。
    今天，我通过这一庆祝大会，向英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员，致以热烈的祝贺。同时向朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，致以热烈的祝贺。
    向在抗美援朝的旗帜下奋起诚心诚意地援助朝鲜人民的兄弟般的中国人民及其领袖毛泽东主席，致以衷心的感谢和热烈的祝贺。
    亲爱的诸位！
    朝鲜停战协定的签订，是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。
    但是李承晚匪帮在美国的好战分子公开地支持下还在反对朝鲜停战。
    所以，我们要经常地提高警惕，和全世界的人民一起，监视美国是否切实履行停战协定的义务。如果李承晚匪帮敢于破坏停战，那我们就要像金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员已在停战命令中明确声明的一样“保持高度戒备，坚守阵地，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和破坏行动。”
    同时，在即将召开的高一级的政治会议，一定要解决关于朝鲜的统一独立及民主发展的问题。
    我们一贯主张朝鲜问题必须在公平合理的基础上获得解决。就是说，一切外国军队包括中国人民志愿军在内撤出朝鲜，朝鲜问题由朝鲜人民自己来处理。
    所以，高一级的政治会议必须在平等协商的基础上召开。必须利于一个统一、独立、民主的新朝鲜的建立。我们要继续奋斗促使这个高一级的政治会议完成这一任务。
    亲爱的诸位！
    朝鲜人民一定以高度的警惕，把在祖国解放战争过程中所曾发挥的英雄主义精神、坚强性和崇高的自我牺牲精神，要完全转向到恢复和建设由于美帝国主义者武装侵略而遭到破坏的城市、农村、工厂和企业方面去。
    我相信：这一工作在以苏联和中国为首的全世界爱好和平人民的声援与帮助下，一定会很快地完成。
    朝中两国人民一定会更加努力，巩固和发展以鲜血结成的战斗友谊。这一友谊是永不磨灭的！任何侵略势力也不可能摧毁的！
    英雄的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    英勇的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    在正义的反侵略战争中英勇牺牲的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军勇士们永垂不朽！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    诚心诚意援助朝鲜人民的中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    积极援助朝鲜人民的苏联人民和苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的团结胜利万岁！
