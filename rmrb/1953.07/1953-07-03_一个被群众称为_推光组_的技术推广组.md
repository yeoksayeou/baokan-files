A Technical Extension Team Known as the "Push-Bare Team" by the Masses
	Yīng Nán
	When I first came to Guilì Village, before I had become familiar with the people here, I often heard them saying the strange phrase "Push-Bare Team."
	One day, I and a comrade went to the fields to see about thinning the seedlings, passing by a cornfield. This was planted using the new farming method of Zhaoyuan County, and the seedlings were growing evenly and strongly. He pointed to this piece of land and said, "Look how good this corn is! But last year, we didn't even harvest the seeds." After a while, he told me this story:
	During the spring plowing last year, the technical extension team of the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was helping out at the New Life Agricultural Production Cooperative; they advocated planting soybeans on this cornfield and insisted on flat sowing. Du Kuiyuan, the leader of the extension team, said that this way "we can harvest more grain." At the time, many members of the cooperative did not agree with this idea because "this land is newly reclaimed wasteland, full of reed roots. If we flat sow soybeans, the reed will grow out, and the soybean seedlings will be impossible to manage!" But Du Kuiyuan insisted on his own opinion. At that time, the members of the cooperative believed that Du Kuiyuan was an agricultural technician and a college student, who knew a lot and had broad knowledge, so they followed his opinion. A total of ten *hsiang* of soybean were planted, using more than three *shi* of seeds.
	After a period of time, before the soybean seedlings sprouted, the reeds had grown to knee-high. At this time, if you wanted to hoe, you would inevitably damage the seedlings. But after the seedlings sprouted, they were already covered by the reeds, and even a hoe couldn't be inserted. After the autumn harvest, these ten *hsiang* of land only yielded two *shi* and five *dou* of beans, not even enough to recover the seeds.
	The extension team led by Du Kuiyuan also did another unsatisfactory thing here. At that time, the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry lent a set of horse-drawn farm implements to the New Life Agricultural Production Cooperative. The people here had never seen this newfangled thing and didn't know how to use it. People asked Du Kuiyuan and others for advice, but Du Kuiyuan ignored them and said, "This is twenty horsepower, you just buy twenty horses!"
	At that time, the cooperative didn't have any money, so it borrowed a sum from the bank and distributed it to some of the members, letting the members buy six horses (including the original ones, there were nineteen in total), spending a total of more than sixteen million yuan. The members were burdened with this heavy debt, but the horses they bought could not all be used for production, because the horse-drawn farm implements were used seasonally. When the machines were idle, the horses were also idle. Last winter, the farmers had to sell these extra horses cheaply again.
	Du Kuiyuan and others stayed here for nineteen months, and according to the farmers, they didn't do much good for everyone. They often acted as if they were technical personnel and did not accept the opinions of the masses; if something did not suit Du Kuiyuan's ideas, he would scold people for not understanding "technology." In fact, besides moving books and lecturing dogmatically, Du Kuiyuan couldn't even "recognize sorghum seedlings and corn seedlings"!
	In the countryside, after dinner is a time of leisure. Sometimes, when the farmers thought about going to his room to chat and learn something from him, Du Kuiyuan would point at people with a pen and say, "Is there anything? Go to sleep if there's nothing!" Please think, what embarrassing words these are! Du Kuiyuan treats the masses with such an attitude, even if he has very good technology, the masses will not accept it, let alone that Du Kuiyuan and others have ruined some "good things"? Of course, people can't trust them. The farmers gave their extension team a nickname, called the "Push-Bare Team." This means: "If you follow Du Kuiyuan's method, not only will everyone not get increased production, but also everyone's property will be pushed bare."

    一个被群众称为“推光组”的技术推广组
    英男
    我刚来到皈力村，和这里的人们还未混熟的时候，就常听到他们讲着“推光组”这句古怪的话。
    一天，我和一位同志到地里去看间苗，路过一片玉米地。这是采用肇源县新耕作法播种的，苗儿长得又齐又壮。他指着这块地说：“你看这苞米多好呀！可是去年却连种籽都没收回来。”停了一会，他给我说出这么一段故事来：
    在去年春耕的时候，内蒙古自治区人民政府农牧部的技术推广组，正在这里新生农业生产合作社帮助工作；他们主张把这块苞米地种上黄豆，并且一定要平播。推广组组长杜魁元说这样“能够多打粮食”。当时，有好多社员都不赞成这个意见，原因是“这块地是新开的荒地，地里净是芦苇根子，如果平播种黄豆，等芦苇长出来，豆苗就没法收拾了！”但杜魁元还是坚持他自己的意见。那时候，社员们认为杜魁元是个农业技术员，又是个大学生，懂得多，见识广，于是就按照他的意见作了。共种了十垧地黄豆，用了三石多籽种。
    过了一时期，黄豆苗儿还没钻出来，芦苇就长得有没膝高了。这时候你想?铲，非把苗芽伤害了不行。但等苗儿钻出来，已经被芦苇遮住，连锄头都伸不进去了。秋收后，这十垧地只打了二石五斗豆子，连种籽都没有收回来。
    杜魁元所领导的推广组在这里还做了一件不能令人满意的事。那时候农牧部给新生农业生产合作社贷了一套马拉农具。这里的人们从来没见过这个新鲜玩艺，不知道怎么使用。人们向杜魁元等请教，杜魁元爱理不理地说：“这是二十匹马力的，你们就买二十匹马好了！”
    当时，社里没有钱，向银行贷了一笔款，分给了一部分社员，让社员们买了六匹马（连原有的在内，共是十九匹了），总共花了一千六百五十多万元。社员们负了这笔重债，但是买来的马却不能全部用到生产上去，原因是马拉农具是按着季节使用的，机器一闲着，马也就跟着闲起来了。去年冬天，农民们又只好把这些多余的马，廉价卖了出去。
    杜魁元等在这里住了十九个月，据农民说，他们并没给大家办了多少好事。他们常常以技术人员自居，不接受群众意见；如果有某件事情不对杜魁元的心思，他便骂人不懂“技术”。实际上，杜魁元除了搬书本讲教条以外，连“高粱苗和玉米苗都认不出来”！
    在农村，晚饭以后是闲散的时间。有时，农民们想到他屋里聊聊，跟他学点东西，杜魁元就用钢笔朝着人们一点，说：“有事吗？没事睡觉吧！”请想，这是多么令人难堪的话语呀！杜魁元拿这样的态度对待群众，即使他有很高明的技术，群众也是不会接受的，何况杜魁元等把一些“好事”都办坏了呢？人们当然就不能信任他们了。农民们给他们的推广组起了个别名，叫“推光组”。这就是说：“照着杜魁元的办法作下去，不但使大家得不到增产，而且还要把大家的财产都推光了。”
