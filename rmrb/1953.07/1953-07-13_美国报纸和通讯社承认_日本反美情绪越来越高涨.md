Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: "There is evidence that anti-American sentiment is rising in Japan." This is the first sentence of a United Press report relaying a "Christian Science Monitor" editorial from the 9th.

The editorial said: Anti-American sentiment "can be clearly seen in the tone of articles written by Japanese intellectuals in major Japanese magazines and weeklies. This can be evidenced in the popularity of films depicting Americans as cruel and ruthless, in their clamoring about troublesome issues like 'occupation army bastards,' and in frequently portraying wartime atomic bombings as American crimes." The editorial acknowledged that the rising and widespread anti-American sentiment in Japan is due to the long-term American military occupation and trampling of Japanese political and economic sovereignty, reducing Japan to an American colony. It said: As long as one "seriously considers" that the United States not only occupies Japan but also wants "it to gratefully link its sovereignty and trade policies with the wishes of (America), the victorious nation, then the aforementioned (anti-American) phenomenon is not surprising." The editorial worriedly said: The anti-American sentiment in Japan "should not be ignored."

Prior to this, the Associated Press issued a dispatch from Tokyo on June 12th regarding the anti-American wave in Japan. The Associated Press said: "Several books depicting American soldiers as public enemies rather than protectors of Japan are now selling like hotcakes. Similarly, blatant condemnations of American soldiers have now become an almost obligatory feature in every issue of Japanese magazines and newspapers if they want to maintain or increase their sales." The Associated Press said that books like "Military Base Japan," "Base Children," and "Japan's Chastity," which expose the adverse effects of American military bases on Japan and the atrocities of the American occupation forces, have become the best-selling books in Japan this year. The Associated Press admitted: "This anti-American wave is not sudden, nor is it without cause." That is, the Japanese people have "come to see American soldiers as a spiritual threat to their wives, daughters, and children."

### 美国报纸和通讯社承认  日本反美情绪越来越高涨

    美国报纸和通讯社承认
    日本反美情绪越来越高涨
    【新华社十二日讯】“有证据说明日本的反美情绪是越来越高涨了。”这是合众社在转述美国“基督教科学箴言报”九日社论时的第一句话。
    这篇社论说：反美情绪“从日本知识分子在日本主要杂志和周刊中写的文章的语调里就可以很明显地看得出来。这可以在描写美国人残酷无情的那种电影片的流行上，在他们喧嚷着像‘占领军私生子’这样恼人的问题上和经常把战时原子弹轰炸说成是美国的罪恶行为等方面得到证明。”社论承认日本反美情绪所以越来越高涨和普遍，是由于美国长期的对日军事占领和蹂躏日本的政治与经济主权，把日本降为美国的殖民地。它说：只要“认真地考虑”一下：美国不仅占领了日本，而且还要“它怀着感恩的心情把它的主权和贸易政策跟（美国）这个战胜国的愿望联系起来，那末，上面所说（反美）的现象就不足为奇了”。社论担心地说：对于日本的反美情绪“不应熟视无睹”。
    在这以前，美联社曾在六月十二日从东京发出的一条关于日本的反美浪潮的消息。美联社说：“几本把美国兵描写成为日本的公敌而不是保护者的书，现在像热烧饼一样地畅销着。同样，对美国兵的放肆的谴责现在差不多成了日本杂志和报纸每期必登的内容，如果它们想要维持或者要增加他们的销路的话。”美联社说，像“军事基地的日本”、“基地儿童”、“日本的贞操”这些揭露美国军事基地对日本的恶劣影响和美国占领军暴行的书，都成了日本今年最畅销的书。美联社承认：“这种反美浪潮不是突然而来的，也不是没有原因的。”那就是日本人民已“把美国大兵看作是对他们的妻子、女儿和孩子的精神威胁”。
