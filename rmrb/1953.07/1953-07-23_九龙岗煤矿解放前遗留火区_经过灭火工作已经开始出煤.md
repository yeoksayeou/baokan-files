    Jiulonggang Coal Mine's Pre-Liberation Fire Zone
    Fire Extinguished, Coal Production Begins
    The four fire zones in the Jiulonggang Coal Mine were caused by the pillaging of underground resources by the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang reactionary rule. In order to prevent further losses of underground resources, the Jiulonggang Coal Mine began fire extinguishing work in the fire zones in 1951. Since the beginning of this year, high-pressure water pipes and mud pumps have been used to inject large amounts of mud into the fire zones from above and below ground, which has rapidly weakened the fire. Reconnaissance and temperature measurements have proved that three of the four fire zones have been basically extinguished. Up to now, 60,000 tons of coal have been mined. The task of extinguishing all fire zones will be completed by the end of this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    九龙岗煤矿解放前遗留火区
    经过灭火工作已经开始出煤
    九龙岗煤矿的四个火区是日伪和国民党反动统治掠夺地下资源造成的。为了不使地下资源继续遭受损失，九龙岗煤矿从一九五一年开始，就在火区进行灭火工作；今年以来，更利用高压水管和泥浆泵从井上、井下向火区大量灌泥浆，使火势迅速减弱。经侦察和测温证明，四个火区已有三个基本上被扑灭。到目前为止，已开采出六万吨煤。扑灭全部火区的任务将在今年年底完成。（据新华社讯）
