Yunnan Province, since last winter, has adopted the policy of "unified leadership, decentralized operation, and local production and sales" to organize iron furnaces to repair and manufacture agricultural tools for farmers, and has achieved remarkable results. In addition to systematically mobilizing iron furnaces scattered in various cities, towns, and villages to repair old agricultural tools for farmers, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives in various regions have also signed processing contracts with 1,001 iron furnaces to manufacture new agricultural tools for farmers. According to incomplete statistics from 51 counties as of the end of February, 113,363 new agricultural tools have been manufactured.

After the conclusion of land reform in the vast rural areas of the province last winter, the farmers' enthusiasm for production soared unprecedentedly, and they urgently demanded the repair of agricultural tools and the addition of new ones. However, the iron furnace handicraft workers who manufactured agricultural tools scattered in various places had various concerns because they did not understand the state's policy of supporting handicrafts to serve agricultural production, and many of them voluntarily stopped their operations. Some handicraft workers, although less concerned, were also operating intermittently due to lack of funds and raw materials. Although the economic departments of various special districts and counties had already started organizing iron furnaces to produce agricultural tools, they lacked the unified leadership of the local Party and government, and the policy was not clear. Some counties blindly concentrated iron furnaces for production, while others only relied on orders from other places, which could not solve the problem of agricultural tool supply. Since the provincial leadership repeatedly emphasized the importance of agricultural tool supply in January this year, and clearly put forward the policy of "unified leadership, decentralized operation, and local production and sales," Party and government departments at all levels have strengthened their leadership over this work: they have universally investigated the quantity and specifications of agricultural tools that farmers need to repair and manufacture, as well as the ideological concerns, production capacity, and difficulties of iron furnace handicraft workers. The counties also successively held representative meetings of iron and wood workers to explain the policies and point out the future, in order to enhance their production enthusiasm. The industrial and commercial, banking, cooperative and other departments promptly supplied more than 1.8 million catties of iron and loaned more than 2 billion yuan in funds to support their production. This enabled the iron furnaces in various places to quickly start operations and opened up a new situation for the province's agricultural tool supply work this year. For example, the farmers in Yanshan District, Zhaotong County, Zhaotong Special District, only needed to add 20,000 hoes, but the district supply and marketing cooperative did not investigate the actual situation and ordered 80,000 pieces from the special district agricultural tool factory. The trade and cooperation departments of Huize County had more than 20,000 catties of pig iron in stock, but instead of organizing local iron furnaces to produce, they also ordered 200,000 agricultural tools from the special district agricultural tool factory. As a result of such blind ordering, Zhaotong County, which originally had abundant iron resources and a large number of iron furnace workers, also created a chaotic phenomenon of competing for agricultural tools. After the special district conducted investigations on the actual situation and strengthened leadership, it convened a meeting of workers and commercial cadres in early February to specifically discuss the issue of unified leadership in ironwork production of agricultural tools. After the meeting, an agricultural tool production guidance committee at the special district and county levels, including representatives of ironworkers, was organized, and agricultural tool production guidance groups were also established in districts and townships, overcoming the past chaotic phenomena of supply and marketing disconnect and blind competition. On this basis, the counties also universally convened representative meetings of handicraft producers, mobilizing 1,645 iron furnaces to repair and manufacture agricultural tools for farmers, and transferred scrap iron stored in Yanjin, Zhaotong and other counties to Huize, Qiaojia, Ludian and other counties that lacked iron. After such unified planning and deployment, of the 552,289 agricultural tools to be repaired and 199,272 new agricultural tools to be added throughout the district, except for 100,000 pieces stipulated to be manufactured and supplied by the special district agricultural tool factory, the remaining repair and manufacturing tasks were completed by the iron furnace industry. In January, seven counties in Qujing Special District held representative meetings of iron and wood workers respectively, organized on-site technical exchanges, mobilized ironworkers to observe and exchange experiences with each other, and studied how to improve the quality of agricultural tools. The 810 iron furnaces organized in the district repaired 68,000 old agricultural tools and manufactured 23,976 new agricultural tools in two months. Jinning County mobilized 50 iron furnaces to repair and manufacture agricultural tools for farmers, and seized the farming season to issue agricultural loans. On March 27, it held a materials exchange meeting to help promote the newly made agricultural tools. At the meeting, more than 17,000 agricultural tools of 37 specifications were prepared for farmers to freely choose and buy agricultural tools, which the farmers were very satisfied with.

However, the Party and government leadership in some counties did not pay attention to solving the problem of agricultural tools, did not earnestly implement the policy of "unified leadership, decentralized operation, and local production and sales," and handed over this major task of agricultural tool supply to the trade and cooperation departments alone; and these departments did not investigate and study, did not see that the farmers first demanded to repair old agricultural tools, and then appropriately added new agricultural tools, nor did they see that the scattered local iron furnaces were the main force in solving the problem of agricultural tool supply, but only wanted to order from other places, or adopted simple methods and blindly concentrated the iron furnaces to manufacture, resulting in products that did not meet specifications, were of poor quality, and were not wanted by farmers, greatly affecting agricultural production.

### 采取“统一领导、分散经营、就地产销”方针  云南省大力组织铁炉解决供应农具问题

    采取“统一领导、分散经营、就地产销”方针
    云南省大力组织铁炉解决供应农具问题
    云南省自去年冬季以来，采取“统一领导、分散经营、就地产销”的方针，组织铁炉为农民修补和制造农具，已获得显著成绩。各地除有计划地发动分散在各市、镇、乡村的铁炉为农民修补旧农具外，各地国营贸易部门、合作社并与一千零一盘铁炉订立加工合同，为农民制造新农具。据二月底五十一个县的不完全统计，已制造了新农具达十一万三千三百六十三件。
    该省广大农村在去年冬季结束土地改革以后，农民生产情绪空前高涨，迫切要求修补农具和添置新农具。但分布在各地的制造农具的铁炉手工业者，因为不了解国家扶持手工业为农业生产服务的政策，心存各种顾虑，很多人都自动地停了业。有些手工业者虽然顾虑较少，但因缺乏资金、原料，也是半停半歇。各专署、县的经济部门，虽然已经着手组织铁炉生产农具，但缺乏当地党、政的统一领导，方针不明确，有些县盲目地集中铁炉生产，有些县只依赖外地的订货，解决不了农具供应问题。自省的领导方面在今年一月里一再强调农具供应的重要，以及明确提出“统一领导、分散经营、就地产销”的方针以后，各级党、政部门才加强了对这一工作的领导：普遍调查了农民所需要修补和制造农具的数量、规格，以及铁炉手工业者的思想顾虑、生产能力及困难等情况。各县并先后召开了铁、木工人代表会议，交代政策和指明前途，以提高其生产情绪。各工商、银行、合作等部门，及时供应了一百八十多万斤铁，贷放二十多亿元资金，以扶持他们生产。这就使各地铁炉都迅速开业，为今年全省的农具供应工作打开了新的局面。如昭通专区昭通县炎山区农民只需新添置锄头二万把，而区供销合作社竟不调查实际情况，即向专区农具厂订购八万件。会泽县贸易、合作部门存有二万多斤生铁，不组织当地铁炉生产，也向专区农具厂订购农具二十万件。这样盲目订购的结果，昭通县本来是有丰富铁源、并有大批铁炉工人的地区，也造成了争购农具的混乱现象。自专署对实际情况进行了调查并加强领导以后，即于二月初旬召开工、商干部会议，专门讨论了关于统一领导铁工生产农具问题。会后就组织包括有铁工代表参加的专区、县两级农具生产指导委员会，区、乡也成立了农具生产指导小组，克服过去供销脱节和盲目争购的混乱现象。在这一基础上，各县又普遍地召开手工业生产者代表会议，发动了一千六百四十五盘铁炉为农民修补及制造农具，并把盐津、昭通等县所存的废铁，调运给缺铁的会泽、巧家、鲁甸等县。经过这样统一计划和部署以后，全区全年所需修补的五十五万二千二百八十九件农具，新添制的十九万九千二百七十二件农具，除有十万件规定由专区农具厂制造供应外，其余的修补及制造任务，均由铁炉业完成。曲靖专区七个县在一月份分别召开的铁木工人代表会上，组织了现场技术交流，发动铁工们互相观摩、交流经验，研究提高农具质量。全区组织起的八百十盘铁炉，在两个月中就修补旧农具六万八千件，制造新农具二万三千九百七十六件。晋宁县发动五十盘铁炉为农民修补制造农具，并抓住农时发放农贷，在三月二十七日召开了物资交流会，帮助推销新制农具，在会上就准备好有三十七种规格的一万七千多件农具，由农民自由选买农具，农民们都非常满意。
    但有些县的党、政领导方面对于解决农具问题没有引起重视，没有认真执行“统一领导，分散经营，就地产销”的方针，把农具供应这一重大工作，交给贸易、合作部门单独去做；而这些部门不调查研究，看不到农民首先要求修补旧农具，以后才是适当增置新农具的情况，也看不到分散在当地的铁炉是解决农具供应问题的主要力量，只想从外地订购，或是采取简单办法，盲目地把铁炉集中起来制造，结果弄得成品不合规格、质量又坏，农民不要，大大影响了农业生产。
