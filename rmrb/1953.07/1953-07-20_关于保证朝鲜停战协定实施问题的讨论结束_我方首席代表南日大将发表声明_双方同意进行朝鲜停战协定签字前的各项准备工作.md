Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 19th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations issued the following communique on July 19th:

    At the plenary session of both delegations on July 19th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, read our statement on the issue of guaranteeing the implementation of the armistice, concluding the discussion of this issue. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    In the latter half of June 1953, the South Korean government and its army, under the control of the United Nations Command, coerced more than 27,000 of our captured personnel to leave the prisoner-of-war camps, destroying the agreement on prisoners of war, thereby causing delays and obstructions to the signing of the armistice agreement and depriving the implementation of the various articles of the armistice agreement of guarantees. We believe that the United Nations Command cannot shirk its responsibility for condoning this destructive action by the South Korean government and its army, and for the adverse developments regarding the Korean armistice that may arise from this action.

    The destructive actions of the South Korean government and its army have aroused the greatest vigilance of the Chinese and Korean people, as well as peace-loving people around the world. In order to obtain a clear guarantee for the implementation of the various articles of the armistice agreement, so that a true armistice can be achieved in Korea, the Korean-Chinese side considered it necessary to raise a series of questions with the United Nations Command for clarification. Now, in order to allow the people of the world to see your guarantees, we have summarized your answers to the various questions we raised, based on the record, as follows:

    1. Regarding the question of whether the Korean armistice includes the South Korean government and its army, General Harrison replied on July 11, 1953, that "The United Nations Command, in proposing the implementation of the armistice agreement, has expressed its willingness to be bound by the various articles of the draft armistice agreement." On July 16, General Harrison said: "I said on July 12: 'You are guaranteed that the United Nations Command, including the Republic of Korea army, is prepared to implement the terms of the armistice agreement.' ... I assure you again that we have obtained the necessary guarantees from the Republic of Korea government that it will not obstruct the implementation of the draft armistice agreement in any way."

    2. Regarding the question of whether the South Korean army will completely cease fire within twelve hours of the signing of the armistice agreement, and will withdraw two kilometers from the military demarcation line across the entire front within seventy-two hours of the agreement taking effect to establish a demilitarized zone, so as to achieve a true ceasefire and armistice in Korea, General Harrison gave the same answer on July 12 and July 15: "The Republic of Korea army will cease fire and withdraw."

    3. Regarding the question of how the United Nations Command guarantees that the South Korean army can abide by the relevant articles of the armistice agreement, General Harrison replied on July 11: "Once the terms of the armistice agreement are violated by one side or the other, the armistice agreement stipulates that the facts will be presented to the Military Armistice Commission... Finally, if the efforts of the Armistice Commission to ensure compliance with the terms of the armistice prove ineffective, and if the security of any party is threatened by the other party's failure to comply with the provisions of the armistice, the injured party has just and sufficient reason to cancel the terms of the armistice agreement and take such military action as it deems necessary in the circumstances. The United Nations Command will not support any act of aggression by the Republic of Korea that violates the armistice."

    4. Regarding the question of whether the United Nations Command will remain in a state of armistice if the South Korean army violates the armistice agreement after the armistice and takes aggressive actions, and the Korean-Chinese side takes necessary actions to resist aggression and guarantee the armistice, General Harrison said on July 13: "The answer is yes."

    5. Regarding the question of whether the United Nations Command's so-called "no support whatsoever" includes not providing the South Koreans with equipment and supplies if the South Korean army violates the armistice agreement after the armistice and takes aggressive actions, and we take necessary actions to resist aggression and guarantee the armistice, General Harrison said on July 13: "The answer is yes."

    6. Regarding the fact that the Chief Representative of the United Nations Command said that "in the period after the cessation of hostilities," the South Korean government would cooperate closely with the United Nations Command in implementing the various provisions of the draft armistice agreement, the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that the restrictive phrase "in the period after the cessation of hostilities" was clearly inconsistent with the armistice agreement, because the validity of the armistice agreement has no time limit, and the restrictive phrase of the United Nations Command was tacitly in line with Syngman Rhee's statement that he would only not obstruct the armistice for ninety days. Later, General Harrison replied on July 13: "The armistice has no time limit." On July 16, General Harrison said: "Your side has requested a guarantee that the government and army of the Republic of Korea will abide by all provisions of the armistice agreement for the entire duration of the armistice, and not for a temporary period limited to a certain time... The United Nations Command has stated clearly and unequivocally that it is prepared to conclude and abide by all the provisions of the armistice agreement, including Article Sixty-Two."

    7. Regarding the question of whether the United Nations Command guarantees the safety of neutral nations personnel and Korean-Chinese personnel who go to the South Korean area to work in accordance with the armistice agreement, and the convenience of their work, General Harrison replied on July 12: "Any personnel who are permitted to enter the Republic of Korea in accordance with the armistice agreement will be protected." On July 13, General Harrison further replied: "The answer is yes. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and your personnel who are dispatched to our area in accordance with the armistice agreement will be protected and given convenience in their work."

    8. Regarding how to guarantee the safety of neutral nations personnel and Korean-Chinese personnel who enter the South Korean area to perform tasks in accordance with the agreement, and to provide them with convenience in their work, General Clark stated in his reply to Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai on June 29, 1953: "Where necessary, the United Nations Command will do its best to establish military defense measures to ensure that the terms of the armistice will be complied with." General Harrison also said on July 10: "The United Nations Command will provide police protection for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the Joint Red Cross teams."

    9. Regarding the fact that the South Korean government and its army violated the agreement on prisoners of war and forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our captured personnel, our side believes that the United Nations Command has an undeniable responsibility to retrieve all of these people. General Clark said in his aforementioned letter of June 29: "The United Nations Command is continuing its efforts to recover the escaped prisoners of war." However, General Harrison refused to provide further details on this matter.

    10. Regarding the question of whether the United Nations Command is prepared to guarantee that it will not take forced detention actions against the remaining Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, General Harrison replied on July 12: "The remaining prisoners of war will not be released before being handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." On July 15, General Harrison said: "The remaining prisoners of war on your side who refuse direct repatriation will be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

    The above, with the exception of the ninth question, are the replies made by the United Nations Command regarding the guarantee of the implementation of the Korean armistice since the resumption of the armistice negotiations. We believe that the clarification of these issues is essential.

    However, regarding the issue of recovering the more than 27,000 prisoners of war forcibly detained by the South Korean government and its army, the United Nations Command has not actually made any efforts, nor has it provided our side with further details. And regarding the issue of the remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, although the United Nations Command has repeatedly affirmed its guarantee that these personnel will be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Mr. Robertson, the representative of the President of the United States, publicly advocated in his joint communique with the South Korean government that "at the end of a certain period, all prisoners who wish to avoid returning to communist rule should be released in South Korea, and for non-communist Chinese prisoners, they should be allowed to go to the destination of their choice." Although this joint communique has no binding effect in the Korean armistice agreement, this proposition of the United States government and the South Korean government clearly violates Article 11 of the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and attempts to prepare for South Korea's further destruction of the prisoner-of-war agreement and forced detention of our captured personnel after the armistice. In view of the above situation, our side is not satisfied with your guarantee regarding the prisoner-of-war issue, and reserves our right to demand that you guarantee the full implementation of the prisoner-of-war agreement.

    In view of the guarantees made by the United Nations Command regarding the implementation of the Korean armistice agreement, although our side is still not satisfied with your guarantee regarding the prisoner-of-war issue, our side is still prepared to immediately discuss with you the various preparations before the signing of the armistice agreement. The Korean-Chinese side declares: Your side bears the full responsibility for recovering all of the forcibly detained prisoners of war at any time and providing our side with details. If, after the armistice, your side still fails to recover these prisoners of war and hand them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, our side reserves the right to submit this issue to the political conference stipulated in Article 60 of the armistice agreement for discussion. Regarding the matter of the detaining side handing over all remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at a designated location in Korea, in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in view of the fact that the South Korean government has declared its refusal to allow Indian troops to enter the country, our side believes that this issue must be resolved before the signing of the armistice, so as to promptly notify the relevant neutral countries and Indian troops to prepare in advance, and this issue should not be left to be resolved by the Military Armistice Commission after the armistice.

    It must be pointed out that the South Korean government and its army have been openly claiming until recently that South Korea opposes the armistice and has the freedom of action, and the United Nations Command is still adopting a policy of condoning it. The Korean-Chinese side must declare here that the United Nations Command's guarantee regarding the South Korean government and its army's compliance with the terms of the armistice agreement will only be accepted at its face value. If the United Nations Command continues this policy of condoning the South Korean government and its army, then whether before or after the armistice, the implementation of the terms of the Korean armistice agreement may continue to be undermined. This is something that the governments and people of all countries around the world, especially the governments and people of the countries concerned on both sides of the Korean War, must pay serious attention to. We believe that at any time such a situation occurs, the United Nations Command must strictly implement the solemn guarantees it has put forward itself, based on the inspection and judgment of the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Commission, as well as the just demands of peace-loving people around the world. The Korean-Chinese side will then have the right to take anti-aggression self-defense actions in accordance with the armistice agreement and the guarantees provided by the United Nations Command to ensure the implementation of the armistice.

    Once the Korean armistice agreement is signed and takes effect, the Korean-Chinese side guarantees the implementation of all the terms of the armistice agreement. We also believe that the peace-loving people of the world will firmly support the Korean armistice, so as to promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and thwart any conspiracies of warmongers.

    At the same meeting, both sides agreed to resume administrative meetings to conduct various preparatory work before the signing of the armistice agreement.

    The staff officers of both sides are scheduled to begin holding meetings in groups on July 20.

    关于保证朝鲜停战协定实施问题的讨论结束
    我方首席代表南日大将发表声明
    双方同意进行朝鲜停战协定签字前的各项准备工作
    【新华社开城十九日电】朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团七月十九日发表公报如下：
    我方首席代表南日大将在七月十九日双方代表团大会上，宣读了关于保证停战实施问题的我方声明，结束了这一问题的讨论。声明全文如下：
    一九五三年六月下半月，你方的南朝鲜政府及其军队在联合国军的控制之下，胁迫二万七千余名我方被俘人员离开战俘营，破坏了关于战俘问题的协议，因而使停战协定的签订遭受拖延和阻挠，并使停战协定各项条款的实施失去保障。我们认为，对于南朝鲜政府及其军队的这一破坏行动以及由此行动而可能引起的关于朝鲜停战的不利发展，联合国军是不能推卸它的纵容责任的。
    南朝鲜政府及其军队的破坏行动引起了朝中人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的最大警惕。为了取得对于实施停战协定各项条款的明确保证，以便能够在朝鲜实现真正的停战，朝中方面认为有必要向联合国军方面提出了一系列的问题要求澄清。现在，为使世界人民得以共见你方的保证，我们根据记录将你方对于我方所提各项问题的答复综述如下：
    一、关于朝鲜停战究竟包括不包括南朝鲜政府及其军队在内的问题，哈利逊将军在一九五三年七月十一日答复说：“联合国军在提出执行停战协定时，已表示愿意受停战协定草案各项条款的约束。”在七月十六日哈利逊将军说：“我在七月十二日说过：‘你们被保证联合国军包括大韩民国军队在内准备实施停战协定的条款。’……我再次向你们保证，我们已从大韩民国政府获得必要的保证，即：它将不以任何方式阻挠停战协定草案条款的实施。”
    二、关于南朝鲜军队是否将在停战协定签字十二小时内完全停火，并将在协定生效七十二小时内全线自军事分界线后撤二公里以成立非军事区，以实现在朝鲜真正的停火与停战的问题，哈利逊将军在七月十二日和七月十五日先后作了同样的回答：“大韩民国军将停火并后撤。”
    三、关于联合国军方面如何保证南朝鲜军队能够遵守停战协定各有关条款的问题，哈利逊将军在七月十一日回答说：“一旦停战协定的条款受到一方或另一方的破坏，停战协定中规定将事实向军事停战委员会提出……最后如果停战委员会为保证停战条款的遵守而作的努力结果无效，如果任何一方的安全因另一方不遵守停战的规定而受到威胁，则受害一方有正当和充分的理由可以取消停战协定的条款，并采取在该情况下为其所认为必要的军事行动。大韩民国进行任何破坏停战的侵略行为时，联合国军将不予以支持。”
    四、关于如果南朝鲜军在停战后破坏停战协定、采取侵略行动，而朝中方面采取必要行动抵抗侵略、保障停战时，联合国军是否仍保持停战状态的问题，哈利逊将军在七月十三日说：“回答是是的。”
    五、关于如果南朝鲜军在停战后破坏停战协定、采取侵略行动，而我们采取必要行动抵抗侵略、保障停战时，联合国军方面所谓不予以任何支持是否包括不给予南朝鲜以装备和供应上的支持的问题，哈利逊将军在七月十三日说：“回答是是的。”
    六、关于联合国军首席代表曾说在“敌对行为停止后的期间”，南朝鲜政府将与联合国军紧密合作实施停战协定草案各项规定的问题，朝中方面曾指出“敌对行为停止后的期间”的约束语显然与停战协定不合，因为停战协定的有效性并无时间限制，而联合国军方面这句约束语与李承晚所表示的他只不过在九十天内不阻挠停战的话有暗合之嫌。后来哈利逊将军在七月十三日回答说：“停战没有时间限制。”七月十六日哈利逊将军说：“你方曾要求保证大韩民国政府与军队将在整个停战有效期间，而不是到某一个期限为止的暂时期间遵守停战协定的所有规定。……联合国军已明白而不含糊地向你们说过，它准备缔结并遵守该停战协定的全部规定，包括第六十二款。”
    七、关于联合国军方面是否保证按照停战协定前往南朝鲜地区工作的中立国人员和朝中方面人员的安全和他们工作上的便利的问题，哈利逊将军在七月十二日回答说：“任何按照停战协定被准许进入大韩民国的人员将受到保护。”七月十三日哈利逊将军进一步答复：“回答是是的。按照停战协定所派遣到我方地区的中立国监察委员会、中立国遣返委员会及你方人员将被保护和给予他们工作上的便利。”
    八、关于如何保障按照协定进入南朝鲜地区执行任务的中立国人员及朝中方面人员的安全，并使他们得到工作上的便利的问题，克拉克将军在一九五三年六月二十九日给金日成元帅彭德怀将军的复信中称：“遇有必要之处，联合国军将尽其所能建立军事上的防卫措施，以保证停战条款将被遵守”。哈利逊将军在七月十日也说：“联合国军将对中立国监察委员会、中立国遣返委员会及联合红十字小组提供警察保护。”
    九、关于南朝鲜政府及其军队破坏了关于战俘问题的协议，强迫扣留了二万七千余名我方被俘人员的问题，我方认为，联合国军方面负有将这些人全部追回的无可推诿的责任。克拉克将军在上述六月二十九日的回信中曾说：“联合国军正继续努力以追回已逃亡的战俘。”但哈利逊将军却对此事拒绝作进一步的交代。
    十、关于联合国军方面是否准备保证对其余的朝中方面被俘人员不再采取强迫扣留行动的问题，哈利逊将军在七月十二日回答说：“剩下的战俘在被送交中立国遣返委员会之前将不被释放。”七月十五日哈利逊将军说：“拒绝被直接遣返的剩余的你方被俘人员将被按照中立国遣返委员会职权范围送交给中立国遣返委员会。”
    以上除第九个问题外，就是停战谈判复会以来联合国军方面关于保证朝鲜停战实施所作的答复。我们认为这些问题的澄清是十分必要的。
    但是，关于追回被南朝鲜政府及其军队强迫扣留的二万七千余名战俘问题，联合国军方面在实际上并没有作过任何努力，也没向我方作出进一步的交代。而关于不直接遣返的剩余战俘问题，尽管联合国军方面曾多次肯定保证：这些人员将按照中立国遣返委员会职权范围送交给中立国遣返委员会，但美国总统代表罗伯逊先生在其与南朝鲜政府发表的联合公报中，却公然主张“在一定的时期结束时，凡是希望避免回到共产党统治下的俘虏，都应在南朝鲜释放，而对于非共产党的中国俘虏，则让他们到他们所选择的目的地去。”虽然这个联合公报在朝鲜停战协定中不起任何约束作用，但美国政府与南朝鲜政府这个主张显然是违背了中立国遣返委员会职权范围第十一款，而企图在停战后为南朝鲜进一步破坏战俘协议强迫扣留我方被俘人员预作准备。鉴于上述情况，我方对于你方关于战俘问题的保证，认为不能满意，并保留我方要求你方保证完全实施战俘协议的权利。
    鉴于联合国军方面关于朝鲜停战协定实施问题所作的保证，尽管我方对你方关于战俘问题部分的保证尚不满意，我方仍然准备与你方即行讨论停战协定签字前的各种准备工作。朝中方面声明：你方对于被强迫扣留的战俘在任何时候都负有全部追回并向我方提出交代的责任。如果在停战后，你方尚不能将这批战俘追回交给中立国遣返委员会，我方将保留将这个问题提交停战协定第六十款规定的政治会议讨论。关于不直接遣返的全部剩余战俘，按照中立国遣返委员会职权范围第二条第四款的规定，由拘留一方在朝鲜境内指定地点交给中立国遣返委员会一事，鉴于南朝鲜政府曾经声明拒绝印度部队入境，我方认为必须在停战签字以前将此问题解决，以便及时通知各有关中立国家和印度部队预为准备，而不应将这个问题留在停战以后交由军事停战委员会解决。
    必须指出：南朝鲜政府及其军队直到最近尚在公开声称南朝鲜反对停战并有其行动的自由，而联合国军对之亦仍然采取纵容政策。朝中方面在此必须声明：联合国军关于南朝鲜政府及其军队遵守停战协定条款的保证将只能按其表面价值而被接受。如果联合国军对南朝鲜政府及其军队的这种纵容政策继续下去，则不论在停战前后，朝鲜停战协定条款的实施均有继续遭受破坏的可能。这是全世界各国政府和各国人民、特别是朝鲜交战双方有关各国的政府和人民所必须严重注意的。我们认为，任何时候如果有这样的情况发生，联合国军方面必须依据军事停战委员会和中立国委员会的视察判断以及全世界爱好和平人民的公正要求来严格执行其自身已经提出的庄严保证。朝中方面于此将有权根据停战协定以及联合国军所提供的保证采取反侵略的自卫行动来保障停战的实施。
    一旦朝鲜停战协定签字生效，朝中方面保证实施停战协定的全部条款。我们并相信，全世界爱好和平的人民对于朝鲜停战必将予以坚决的支持，以促进朝鲜问题的和平解决而挫败好战分子的任何阴谋。
    在同日会上，双方同意重行进行行政性会议，进行停战协定签字前的各项准备工作。
    双方参谋人员定于七月二十日开始分组举行会议。
