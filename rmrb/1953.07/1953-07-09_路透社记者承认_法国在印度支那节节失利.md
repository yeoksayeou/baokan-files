    Reuters Reporter Admits
    France Suffering Setbacks in Indochina
    [Xinhua News Agency, 8th] Reuters reporter Fursche wrote in a dispatch from Saigon recently: "Whether in military or political terms, France is suffering setbacks in Indochina."
    Fursche wrote: "From a military point of view, the situation is this: after seven years of war, territory continues to fall into the hands of the Viet Minh led by the communists." He said: In the past year, the Tonkin Delta, a rice-producing area in northern Vietnam, has become an area frequently haunted by tens of thousands of guerrillas. In the northwest of the Delta, except for the two French army "isolated pockets" of Lai Chau Province and Na San, all have been liberated. The reporter admitted: In the past year, the initiative of the offensive has completely fallen into the hands of the Vietnam People's Army. "The French High Command has not launched a single major offensive." He believes that one of the reasons for this situation is that General Vo Nguyen Giap of the Vietnam People's Army "launched an offensive across the country, dispersing the French forces to such an extent that at present, even if the French High Command is free to act, it is impossible to gather the French forces in any one place to launch a decisive attack on the enemy."
    Fursche mentioned that the new French Commander-in-Chief in Vietnam, Navarre, boasted that he would adopt a new "offensive" policy of "hitting the enemy hard when he sees him," but he expressed doubt about this, saying: "No one can be sure that General Navarre will have more freedom to do so than his predecessors." "Offensive actions are likely to cause heavy casualties, which is a political bomb in France." Fursche then listed the official figures for the heavy losses suffered by French officers and soldiers in the past seven years.
    Fursche finally said: "It is generally believed that the only reason why the Viet Minh can continue to resist the excellent equipment and military minds of the French army is because the Viet Minh is supported by millions of people."

### 路透社记者承认  法国在印度支那节节失利

    路透社记者承认
    法国在印度支那节节失利
    【新华社八日讯】路透社记者弗希特最近从西贡发出的电讯说：“无论在军事上或政治上，法国在印度支那正在节节失利。”
    弗希特写道：“从军事观点看，情况是这样：经过了七年的战争，领土仍旧不断地落入共产党所领导的越盟的手里。”他说：在过去的一年中，越南北部产米地带东京三角洲已成为成万的游击队经常出没的地区。在三角洲西北地带，除了莱州省和那产两个法军的“孤立袋形地区”外，都已被解放。记者承认：过去一年中，攻势的主动权全部落在越南人民军手里，“法军最高司令部没有发动过一次大的进攻。”他认为造成这种情况的一个原因，是由于越南人民军的“武元甲将军在全国发动了进攻，将法军的力量分散到这种程度，以致在目前，即使法军最高司令部可以自由行事，它也不可能把法军聚集在任何一个地方来对敌军发动一次决定性的攻击。”
    弗希特提到新任侵越法军总司令纳瓦尔吹嘘将要采取新的“见了敌人就痛打”的“进攻”政策，但他对此表示怀疑说：“谁也不能肯定纳瓦尔将军能比他的前任有更多的自由可以这样做。”“进攻行动很可能要造成大批伤亡，而这在法国却是一种政治炸弹。”弗希特随着列举了法军官兵在过去七年中损失惨重的官方数字。
    弗希特最后说：“一般认为，越盟之所以能够继续抵抗法国军队的优秀装备和军事头脑的唯一原因，是由于越盟受到千百万人民群众的支持。”
