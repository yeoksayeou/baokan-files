Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 9th: According to TASS, democratic newspapers publish many materials showing that the French working masses are increasingly widely and solidly united in the struggle to raise wages and satisfy other demands.

On July 5th, a mass rally of more than 35,000 people was held in Fouguerolles, Lot-et-Garonne. In the midst of enthusiastic applause, Duclos delivered a speech calling for strengthening united action to establish a people's front to reverse the situation, restore national independence, and form a truly democratic government that advocates peace and social progress.

The General Confederation of Labour (CGT) is conducting a struggle to win united action from all trade union federations. "l'Humanité" published a notice from the Seine Metallurgical Workers' Union, which is affiliated with the CGT. The notice stated that the CGT-affiliated unions, the Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), "Workers' Force" (FO), and some other trade union organizations, unanimously believe that it is necessary to establish a unified alliance to fight for workers' economic demands. The lower-level union organizations and ordinary members of "Workers' Force" and the Confederation of Christian Workers often support the demands put forward by the CGT and fight for their rights alongside Communist Party members. "l'Humanité" publishes daily a large list of machinery manufacturing enterprises where workers and staff, as a result of taking joint action, have achieved demands such as increased wages, paid leave, and severance pay.

Strike struggles are developing widely throughout France. "l'Humanité" points out that the current strike movement in France is characterized by the fact that it is being carried out amidst the increasingly solidifying unified action of ordinary members in various trade union organizations.

Metallurgical workers in the Paris region continue to fight to improve their material conditions. The metallurgical unions of the Paris region published a joint notice in "l'Humanité," expressing their determination to fight to victory.

Dockworkers in various French ports held short strikes on the 6th to fight for a 15% wage increase. Workers in the ports of La Rochelle and La Pallice stopped work and held demonstrations demanding higher wages and the release of imprisoned patriots. In Bordeaux, 1,200 dockworkers stopped work and held a rally. They demanded higher wages, an immediate end to the Vietnam War, and the release of the imprisoned Alain Le Léap and other democrats. Workers in Dunkirk, Boulogne, and other ports also held short strikes.

In Oran (Algeria), dockworkers have long been refusing to load military supplies for the Vietnam War. The dockworkers severely protested the authorities' repressive measures, clashed with the police, and many workers were injured or arrested.
