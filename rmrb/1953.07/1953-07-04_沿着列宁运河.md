    Along the Lenin Canal
    By En. Qiumakov, Soviet Union

    We sped south in a car on the asphalt road from the southern tip of Stalingrad. Stretching out before us was a boundless plain, merging with the horizon in the distance. To the left, near the road, stood the beautiful white stone tower of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal lock. A fresh breeze ruffled the canal's surface, causing it to shimmer and glisten.

    Ahead, close to the road, was a small town. Behind graceful fences were villas, some white, some blue, and some rose-colored. The roofs were tiled, and there were spacious balconies. The streets were shaded by green trees.

    The small town passed, and then came the steppe again. The steppe stretched lazily to the Volga-Don Canal watershed. There, we saw the proudly erected lock tower. The sound of ship whistles occasionally swept across the plain. Ships sailed along the new waterway in an endless stream. Some headed east towards the Volga River, and others headed west towards a vast reservoir, known as the Tsimlyansk Sea.

    The car took us along the canal's asphalt road to the port of Kalach, located on the shore of this young sea.

    The city of Kalach is protected by a huge stone embankment—otherwise, it would be flooded by the sea. Two lighthouses stand at the entrance to the canal.

    The port was bustling. The sound of anchor ropes, whistles, and the churning of propellers mingled together. Huge cranes slowly moved cargo from the cabins to the shore. Large passenger ships left this port for Rostov.

    Navigation on the Volga-Don Canal is busy again. This waterway connects five seas into a unified shipping system, and therefore has very significant economic value. Various goods are transported along this route to various places.

    The Volga-Don Canal was officially opened to navigation in July last year. In the first year of the canal's operation, thousands of ships carrying grain, timber, iron ore, coal, and building materials passed through here, transporting more than 200,000 passengers.

    This year, the Volga-Don Canal's carrying capacity will be more than double that of last year. Particularly large amounts of grain, Donbass coal, and northern timber will be transported. The Volga-Don Canal has added many internal combustion engine ships with large carrying capacity and comfortable passenger ships. The largest inland waterway in the country—from the port of Moscow to Rostov—also passes through the Volga-Don Canal. Now, residents of Moscow and cities along the Volga River travel south for recreation along this waterway. Along the way, they enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Volga River, the architecture of the Volga-Don Canal, and the emerging Tsimlyansk Sea.

    The Tsimlyansk Sea was born last year, and now it is deeper and wider. On windy days, the sea surface can whip up waves three meters high.

    Everywhere on the coast you can see the villages of the Don Cossacks. These villages were relocated from the valley—which is now the seabed. Orchards and vineyards were also moved together. The houses were transported on huge sledges, each sledge pulled by three or four powerful caterpillar tractors. All relocation expenses were paid by the government.

    The Cossacks are living well in their new places. They are very satisfied with the amazing changes that the construction of the Volga-Don Canal and the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station have brought to this steppe. For generations, farmers have dreamed of using water to irrigate the steppe, and today it has finally been realized. The Volga-Don's powerful irrigation system will irrigate 2.75 million hectares of arid and semi-arid land in the Rostov and Stalingrad regions. Last year, the first batch irrigated 100,000 hectares of grassland. Currently, the new land irrigation canal is about to be completed. On the irrigated land, collective farm members are growing barley, wheat, cotton, and cultivating orchards and vineyards. Experience has shown that land irrigated by the Volga-Don River water has very good harvests: on each hectare of land, wheat can yield 35 to 45 quintals, barley can yield 40 to 50 quintals, and cotton can yield 20 to 25 quintals.

    Today, the Volga-Don irrigation system is still being built on a large scale. A large number of excavators, bulldozers, and other earthmoving machines are working on the steppe near the Tsimlyansk coast. The work of digging canals has never stopped throughout the year. In the southern part of the Stalingrad region alone, 33 irrigation canals are being built, with a total length of more than 1,000 kilometers. The excavated earth, according to conservative estimates, reaches 45 million cubic meters. All the work of irrigating the Don steppe is scheduled to be completed in 1956.

    Power transmission lines extend from the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Station to the depths of the steppe, supplying electricity to factories, state farms, collective farms, and irrigation canal builders. The work of agricultural electrification is also being carried out vigorously. The first batch of electric tractor stations are under construction near the Don River. This year, electric tractors will be working on irrigated land. Electricity is widely used in collective farm livestock farms. Milking, shearing sheep, delivering water, and preparing feed are all done with electric machines and combine harvesters.

    The Tsimlyansk Sea will soon become a rich fishing ground. Scientists are concerned about the fish in the Tsimlyansk Sea. The All-Union River and Lake Fisheries Research Institute has established a branch in Stalingrad, specializing in cultivating valuable fish in the Tsimlyansk Sea and other reservoirs of the Volga-Don River. Seventy million young fish and 150,000 large fish such as bream, carp, and pike perch have already been released into the Tsimlyansk Sea. Research has shown that these fish reproduce amazingly quickly in the reservoir. The fish eat a wide variety of food and grow quickly. For example, carp that are put into the sea as small as a finger will grow to be 400 to 600 centimeters in weight in five months.

    The Tsimlyansk Sea is particularly rich in plant food, but there are temporarily no valuable plant-eating fish here. This situation will soon be changed. On the advice of scientists, 500,000 silver carp and grass carp will be released into the Tsimlyansk Sea this year. These are plant-eating fish that live in the Heilongjiang River basin and reservoirs in mainland China. Silver carp and grass carp grow to be 100 to 120 centimeters long and weigh up to 32 kilograms. They will find favorable conditions for life and reproduction in the Tsimlyansk Sea.

    In order to quickly fill this reservoir with valuable edible fish, a large fish farm is being built on the Tsimlyansk coast, with dozens of artificial ponds totaling 900 hectares. Some ponds will raise bream, carp, pike perch, and other fish, allowing them to spawn. Other ponds will nurture the young fish of these species. After they grow up, they will be released into the sea. This fish farm will be able to nurture 27 million fish each year. In addition, a sturgeon farm is also being built, which can also produce millions of young sturgeon and their hybrid species.

    …Late at night, I returned to Stalingrad from the Tsimlyansk coast. Two lighthouses shone on the dam that wedges into the reservoir. The light from the lighthouses points out the entrance to the Volga-Don Canal to ships sailing at night. From Kalach on the Don River to Stalingrad on the steppe, the lights from the lock towers or the various colored streetlights along the Volga-Don Canal were visible all the way. The sound of ship whistles, rippling across the sky above the transformed steppe, broke the silence of the night. (Image attached)

    沿着列宁运河
    苏联　恩·邱马科夫
    我们从斯大林格勒南端坐着汽车在沥青路上向南奔驰，展现在前面的是一望无垠的平原，远远地和地平线溶合在一起。左边，公路附近，耸立着列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河水闸的美观的白石塔。清风吹来，运河水面掀起了一层层的绉纹，闪烁发光。
    前面，公路的近旁，有一座小城。在轻巧的围墙后面是一座一座别墅，有的是白的，有的是蓝的，有的是蔷薇色的。屋顶是瓦盖的，并且有着宽敞的凉台。街道两边绿树成荫。
    小城过去了，又是草原。草原懒洋洋地伸到伏尔加河—顿河运河的分水岭。到了那里，便看见傲然屹立的水闸的立塔。轮船的汽笛声，不时掠过平原。船只沿着新水道络绎不绝地驶过。有的朝东开往伏尔加河，有的朝西驶向一个广阔的蓄水池，也就是人们所说的齐姆梁海。
    汽车沿着运河的沥青路把我们带到了卡拉奇港口，它位于这个年轻的海洋的岸边。
    卡拉奇城有巨大的石堤围护着——要不然的话，它就会给海水淹没了。运河入口处矗立着两座灯塔。
    港内非常热闹。锚索的声音，汽笛的声音，螺旋轮打击水的声音，交织成一片。庞大的起重机，把舱里的货物徐徐移到岸上。容量很大的客船从这个港口开往罗斯托夫。
    在伏尔加河—顿河运河上，航运又繁忙起来了。这条水路把五个海洋联结到一个统一的航运系统中，因而具有非常重大的经济价值。各种货物沿着这条航路运往各地。
    伏尔加河—顿河运河于去年七月正式通航。在运河通航的第一年中，这里通过了数千艘载运着粮食、木材、铁矿、煤与建筑材料的船只，运走了二十万多名旅客。
    今年伏尔加河—顿河运河的载运率将比去年增加两倍多。运输得特别多的将是粮食、顿巴斯的煤和北方的木材。伏尔加河—顿河运河已增添了许多载重力很大的内燃机轮船和舒适的客船。全国最大的内河航路——从莫斯科港到罗斯托夫，也要经过伏尔加河—顿河运河。现在莫斯科和伏尔加河沿岸的城市的居民到南方去休养，都是走这条水路。他们在一路上观赏伏尔加河的绮丽的风景、伏尔加河—顿河运河的建筑与新兴的齐姆良海。
    齐姆梁海是去年诞生的，现在它是更深、更广了。一到刮风天，海面要卷起三公尺高的浪头。
    海岸上处处可以看到顿河流域哥萨克人的村落。这些村落是从河谷——也就是现在的海底，迁居到这里来的。果园和葡萄园也给一块搬来了。房子是用庞大的雪橇运来的，每一个雪橇都用三四架强力的履带拖拉机拖带着。他们迁居的费用全由政府负担。
    哥萨克人在新地方生活得很好。伏尔加河—顿河运河和齐姆梁水电站的建筑，使这一带草原发生了惊人的变化，他们对这种变化是非常满意的。农民世世代代以来梦想着用水来灌溉草原，今天终于实现了。伏尔加河—顿河的强大的灌溉系统，将使罗斯托夫和斯大林格勒州的二百七十五万公顷的旱地和半荒地得到灌溉。去年第一批就灌溉了十万公顷草地。目前新地灌溉渠即将落成。在被灌溉的田地上，集体农庄庄员种植着大麦、小麦、棉花，培育着果园和葡萄园。经验证明，伏尔加河—顿河的水所灌溉的田地都有很好的收成：在每一公顷土地上，小麦可收三十五至四十五公担，大麦可收四十至五十公担，棉花可收二十至二十五公担。
    今天还在大规模地建筑着伏尔加河—顿河的灌溉系统。大批挖土机、铲土机及其它挖土机器在靠近齐姆梁海岸附近的草原上工作着。挖渠的工作一年四季也不曾停歇过。单单是在斯大林格勒州的南部，就正在建筑着三十三条灌溉渠，总长一千多公里。挖出来的土方，据保守的估计，就达四千五百万立方公尺。向顿河草原进行灌溉的全部工作，预定在一九五六年完成。
    输电线从齐姆梁水电站通向草原的深处，为工厂、国营农场、集体农庄和灌溉渠的建设者供应电流。农业电气化的工作也在大力进行。第一批电动拖拉机站正在顿河附近建设中。今年在灌溉的土地上，就将有电动拖拉机工作。集体农庄的养畜场广泛地使用着电力。挤牛奶，剪羊毛，送水，准备饲料等工作都是用电动的机器和联合机来做的。
    齐姆梁海很快就将会成为一个丰富的渔场。科学家们关心着齐姆梁海的鱼。全联盟河湖渔业研究所在斯大林格勒设立了一个分所，专门来培养齐姆梁海和伏尔加河—顿河的其他蓄水库的有价值的鱼。现已向齐姆梁海放进了七千万尾幼鱼和十五万尾鳊鱼、鲤鱼、枪鱼等大鱼。研究的结果证明，这些鱼在蓄水库繁殖得惊人地快。鱼吃了多种多样的食料，就很快地长大了。譬如，把一点点大的鲤鱼放进海里去，过五个月就长到四百到六百公分重了。
    齐姆梁海植物食料特别丰富，不过以植物维生的有价值的鱼这里暂时还没有。这种情况即将予以改变。根据科学家的建议，今年将向齐姆梁海放进五十万尾白鲢和鲩鱼。这是以植物维生的鱼，生活在黑龙江流域和中国内地的贮水池里。白鲢和鲩鱼长达一百至一百二十公分，重达三十二公斤。它们在齐姆梁海里将找到生活和繁殖的有利条件。
    为了使这个蓄水库很快地长满有价值的食用鱼，在齐姆梁海岸上正在建设着庞大的育鱼场，拥有几十个人造池塘，总面积达九百公顷。一些池塘将养育鳊鱼、鲤鱼、枪鱼等鱼，让它们产卵。另一些池塘将抚育这些鱼的幼鱼。它们长大以后就放入海里。这个育鱼场每年将可以抚育成二千七百万尾鱼。此外，还在建筑鳣鱼场，也可出数百万尾鳣鱼的幼鱼及其混合种鱼。
    ……深夜，我从齐姆梁海岸回到斯大林格勒。楔入蓄水库的堤上闪耀着两座灯塔。灯塔的光亮向夜间航行的船只指出伏尔加河—顿河运河的入口处。从顿河上的卡拉奇到草原上的斯大林格勒，一路上不是水闸塔上放射的灯光，就是伏尔加河—顿河运河旁边的各种颜色的路灯。在被改造了的草原的上空荡漾着的轮船汽笛声，划破了夜空的宁静。（附图片）
