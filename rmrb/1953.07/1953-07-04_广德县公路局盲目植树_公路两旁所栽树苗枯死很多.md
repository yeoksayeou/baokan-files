    Guangde County Highway Bureau Blindly Plants Trees
    Many Saplings Planted Along Highways Have Withered
    Readers Lou Rihui, Chen Yuxing, and Chen Gao write: This year, the Guangde County Highway Administration in Anhui Province planted saplings along the county's highways, and many have already withered. Based on an inspection within three kilometers near the station, of the 954 saplings planted, 367 have already withered. Of the 540 poplar trees planted, more than half (312) cannot survive, and the rest may not survive either.

    The reason for this situation is inseparable from the bureaucracy of the Guangde County Highway Administration. Before planting the trees, the bureau did not properly study which saplings were suitable for the local climate, soil, and other environmental conditions, while those trees were unsuitable for planting along the highway. For example, poplar trees have brittle branches and are not suitable for planting along the road; however, the Guangde County Highway Administration planted a large number of this type of tree. As for locust trees, which are suitable for planting along highways, only twelve were planted within three kilometers. After planting the trees, the bureau did not cultivate them or mobilize the masses to protect them; so more of the planted trees died. This kind of behavior of the bureau, which wastes manpower and resources, has created a negative impact among the local people; it is hoped that they will learn a lesson and improve their working style.

### 广德县公路局盲目植树  公路两旁所栽树苗枯死很多

    广德县公路局盲目植树
    公路两旁所栽树苗枯死很多
    读者楼日辉、陈玉兴、谌皋来信：安徽省广德县公路管理局今年在该县公路两旁栽的树苗有很多已经枯死。仅据在车站附近三公里内检查的结果，所栽各种树苗九百五十四棵中，枯死的已有三百六十七棵；其中五百四十棵白杨树，不能成活的竟占二分之一以上（三百十二棵），余下的也不一定能成活。
    造成这种情况的原因，是与广德县公路管理局的官僚主义分不开的。在栽树以前，该局没有很好地研究那些树苗适合当地气候、土壤等环境条件，而那些树则不宜在公路旁栽植。如白杨树的枝干质脆，根本不适合栽在路旁；但广德县公路管理局大量栽植的正是这种树。对于适宜栽植在公路两旁的洋槐树，则在三公里内只栽了十二棵。在栽树以后，该局不加培养，也不发动群众护树；所栽树木就死的更多。该局这种浪费人力、物力的行为，在当地群众中造成了不良的影响；希望他们接受教训，改进工作作风。
