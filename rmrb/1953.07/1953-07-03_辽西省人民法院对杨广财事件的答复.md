    Liaoxi Provincial People's Court's Reply Regarding the Yang Guangcai Incident

    The Liaoxi Provincial People's Court wrote: After our court saw the opinion published in the People's Daily's "Summary of Readers' Letters" on June 2nd, "The Black Mountain County People's Court Should Not Delay Handling the Yang Guangcai Murder Case," we immediately examined our handling of the case and the reasons for the delay. We also inquired by telephone about the final handling of the case by the Black Mountain County People's Court. According to the report from that court, the murderer Qin Fengqi was executed by firing squad on May 25th. Although this case is now concluded, upon examination, we do have shortcomings. As early as December 15th of last year, the Black Mountain County People's Court submitted this case to the Provincial People's Court for review, but it was not until May 13th of this year that we made a final decision. During these five months, although we reviewed the case three times and jointly studied it with relevant departments, we did not promptly urge the Black Mountain County Court to handle it quickly, nor did we go to the scene for investigation, which resulted in a very long delay. We sincerely accept the readers' criticism and are willing to gradually improve our work.

    辽西省人民法院对杨广财事件的答复
    辽西省人民法院来信：我院看到六月二日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊登的“黑山县人民法院不应拖延处理杨广财被杀事件”的意见后，当即检查我们对该案的处理经过和拖延原因，并用电话了解黑山县人民法院对该案最后处理的情形。据该院报告，已于五月二十五日将杀人凶犯秦凤岐枪决。这一案件现在虽已结束，但检查起来我们是有缺点的。早在去年十二月十五日黑山县人民法院即把这一案件呈省人民法院审核，直到今年五月十三日，我们才作出最后决定。在这五个月中，我们虽然曾经三次对该案进行复审并和有关部门共同研究，但没有及时催促黑山县法院迅速处理，也没有亲赴现地调查，以致拖延了很长时间。我们诚恳接受读者的批评，并愿逐步改进我们的工作。
