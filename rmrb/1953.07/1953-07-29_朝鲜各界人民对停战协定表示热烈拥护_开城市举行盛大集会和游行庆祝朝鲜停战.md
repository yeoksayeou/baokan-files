Xinhua News Agency, North Korea, July 28th: In the cities and villages of North Korea, people are spreading the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Korean people, who have contributed greatly to the anti-aggression war, are expressing warm support for the armistice agreement.

    Choi Suk-nyang, a female drilling worker who was awarded the Labor Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said excitedly: "The signing of the armistice agreement is a great victory for the people of Korea and China, and it is the result of the heroic struggle of the people of Korea and China to defend their motherland and defend peace." She continued: "The American aggressors attempted to enslave and destroy our Korean nation, but our Korean nation is a nation that loves peace and freedom. We will not succumb to any aggressive forces. The shameful purpose of the American aggressors has completely failed. Last autumn, the American aggressors dropped more than 400 bombs on our factory with a large number of aircraft, destroying the factory buildings and machines that we had built with hard work. However, it not only failed to discourage us, but also increased our hatred. We must rebuild a better factory on the ground to repay the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who defended us with their blood and flesh."

    Farmer Gao Yong-soo, who was awarded the Labor Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said: "The long-awaited Korean armistice has finally been realized! However, the American warmongers are clamoring to resume the war of aggression in the future, especially the Lee Seung-man traitorous clique is still clamoring against the armistice, so we must be vigilant at all times to prevent the enemy's sabotage plots. I want to unite with other farmers and do our best to step up production and strive for a greater harvest this year to strengthen our motherland and strengthen the forces for defending peace."

    Bae Kwan-sil, a 49-year-old woman from Yongri, Anju County, South Pyongan Province, said: "The American devils and the Lee Seung-man bandits killed my husband, and I myself was hung on a tree and beaten severely by them. The American-Lee bandit army also massacred more than 400 civilians near our village. Now that the armistice has been achieved, I want to write a letter to my son in the People's Army, telling him to remain highly vigilant and stand firmly on the post of defending the motherland, so that the enemy will not invade our territory again."

    When discussing the news of the signing of the armistice agreement, many Korean people unanimously expressed that they will continue to struggle for the full implementation of the armistice agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 28th: On the 28th, Kaesong City held a grand rally and parade of more than 25,000 people to celebrate the Korean Armistice. At dawn, Kaesong City was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and songs were overflowing. People from families, factories and schools, markets and villages, and even from Panmun County and Kaepung County, 30 or 40 li away, marched towards the Kaesong City Ginseng Farm. Countless Korean, Chinese, and Soviet national flags fluttered in the bright sunshine. Workers and students sang songs, and farmers from Deokam-ri danced folk dances excitedly in the square. The people of Kaesong, who had witnessed the American-Lee bandit gang waging a war of aggression for more than three years, and had witnessed the arduous process of the armistice negotiations, how could they not feel proud and excited when they saw that the enemy was finally forced to stop the war? In order to celebrate the victory of the armistice, many families came to participate in the conference with all their family members, and many people arrived in Kaesong from 40 li away at 3:00 in the morning. Several old farmers in their sixties and seventies from Panmun County were dancing like young people.

    At 11:15 a.m., the celebration began. After the presidium took their seats, students from the Goryeo-ri People's School presented them with clusters of beautiful red flowers. Then, the majestic Korean national anthem was played. The jubilant venue gradually calmed down. At 12:00, the whole venue was unusually solemn and quiet. Five minutes later, Marshal Kim Il-sung's speech at the Pyongyang people's celebration of the armistice was broadcast over the loudspeakers. On the day of celebrating the victory, people heard the voice of their beloved leader again. As soon as Marshal Kim Il-sung's words ended, the venue immediately boiled over again, and cheers and applause lasted for a long time. People shouted "Long live! Long live!" People also shouted: "Glory to the Korean-Chinese People's Army!"

    "The forces of peace are invincible!"

    Then Yu Bae-mu, chairman of the Kaesong City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, spoke at the conference. He said, "Now we can't hear the sound of planes and artillery fire. The war has stopped. This is the result of Premier Kim's leadership of our struggle, and the result of the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the people of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union." He called on the people of Kaesong to continue to be vigilant to prevent the enemy from sabotaging the armistice and undermining the agreement.

    The conference adopted congratulatory telegrams to Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Malenkov.

    The grand parade began at 1:30 p.m. People carried and held countless portraits of the three leaders Kim Il-sung, Mao Zedong, and Malenkov, as well as the national flags of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, and various slogans and models. People sang and danced in the parade, extremely excited. When the parade passed the Yao Qingxiang Martyrs' Cemetery, the ruins of the cinema, and other relics left by the enemy's destruction of the agreement, people shouted the slogan "Continue to be vigilant against the enemy." The parade ended at 4:30 p.m. In the evening, people from all walks of life in various districts of the city also held various cultural and entertainment celebrations.

    朝鲜各界人民对停战协定表示热烈拥护
    开城市举行盛大集会和游行庆祝朝鲜停战
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十八日电】在朝鲜北部的城市和乡村里，人们纷纷传告朝鲜停战协定签字的消息。在反侵略战争中贡献了巨大力量的朝鲜人民，都对停战协定表示热烈的拥护。
    荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动勋章的女钻探工人崔淑娘兴奋地说：“停战协定的签订，是我们朝中两国人民的伟大胜利，是我们朝中两国人民为保卫自己祖国、保卫和平而英勇斗争的结果。”她接着说：“美国侵略者企图奴役和毁灭我们朝鲜民族，但是我们朝鲜民族是爱好和平与自由的民族，我们不在任何侵略势力面前屈服，美国侵略者的可耻目的是完全破产了。去年秋天，美国侵略者用大批飞机向我们工厂投下了四百多枚炸弹，把我们用辛勤劳动建设起来的厂房和机器都炸毁了，但是它不但决不能使我们灰心丧气，相反地只有增加我们的仇恨。我们一定要再在地面上建立起一所更加美好的工厂，来报答用血肉保卫我们的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。”
    荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动勋章的农民高永洙说：“盼望很久的朝鲜停战终于实现了！但是，美国的好战分子叫喊着要在将来恢复侵略战争，尤其是李承晚卖国贼集团还在叫喊反对停战，所以我们要时时刻刻提高警惕，防止敌人的破坏阴谋。我要团结其他农民，尽我们最大的努力，加紧生产劳动，争取今年更大的丰收，来加强我们的祖国，加强保卫和平的力量。”
    平安南道安州郡龙里的一位四十九岁的老大娘裴宽实说：“美国鬼子和李承晚匪帮把我的丈夫杀害了，我自己也被他们吊在树上痛打过，美李匪军还在我们村子附近屠杀了四百多个老百姓。现在停战了，但是我要写信告诉在人民军里的儿子，叫他仍要保持高度警惕，好好地站在保卫祖国的岗位上，不让敌人再来侵犯我们的国土。”
    许多朝鲜人民在谈论停战协定签字的消息时，都一致表示今后要为全部实现停战协定和争取和平解决朝鲜问题而继续奋斗。
        【新华社开城二十八日电】二十八日，开城市举行了两万五千多人的盛大集会和游行，庆祝朝鲜停战。天一亮，开城市便锣鼓喧天，歌声洋溢。人们从家庭，从工厂和学校，从市场和农村，甚至从三、四十里外的板门郡和开丰郡走向开城市人蔘场。无数面朝鲜的中国的和苏联的国旗在明朗的阳光中飘扬。工人和学生们唱着歌，德岩里的农民在广场上兴奋地跳起民间舞。三年多以来曾亲眼看到美李匪帮进行侵略战争、亲眼看到停战谈判所经历的艰苦过程的开城人民，现在看到敌人终于被迫停战了，怎么能不感到骄傲和兴奋呢？为了庆祝停战胜利，有很多人家全家人口都来参加这个大会，有很多人在早晨三点钟就从四十里路外赶到开城。有几位从板门郡来的六、七十岁的老农民也像年青人一样在跳舞。
    上午十一时三刻，庆祝大会开始了。主席团就位以后，高丽里人民学校的学生们向他们献上了一簇簇艳丽的红花。接着，雄壮地奏起了朝鲜国歌。欢腾的会场渐渐沉静下来。到十二时，全场异常庄严肃静，五分钟后，扩音器里播出了金日成元帅在平壤人民欢庆停战大会上的讲话。在庆祝胜利的日子里，人们又听到了自己的敬爱的领袖的声音。金日成元帅的话刚一结束，会场上又立刻沸腾起来，欢呼声、鼓掌声经久不息。人们高呼“万岁！万岁！”人们还高呼：“光荣归于朝中人民军队！”
    “和平力量是不可战胜的！”
    接着朝鲜劳动党开城市委会委员长喻培穆在大会上讲话，他说：“现在我们听不到飞机声和炮声了，战争是停下来了，这是金首相领导我们斗争的结果，是中国人民志愿军和以苏联为首的各兄弟国家人民援助我们的结果。”他号召开城人民要继续提高警惕，防止敌人破坏停战、破坏协议。
    大会通过了给金日成首相、毛泽东主席和马林科夫主席的致敬电。
    盛大的游行在下午一时半开始。人们抬着和举着无数面金日成、毛泽东、马林科夫三位领袖的画像和朝、中、苏三国国旗及各种各样的标语牌和模型。在游行中人们载歌载舞，无比兴奋。当游行队伍路过姚庆祥烈士墓、电影院废墟及其他因敌人破坏协议所留下的遗迹时，人们都高呼：“继续对敌人提高警惕”的口号。游行于下午四时半结束。晚上市内各区各界人民还分别举行各种文娱庆祝活动。
