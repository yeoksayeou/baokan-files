    The Communist Youth League organizations directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China began to be established in the winter of 1948. Over the past four years, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Committee of Organs Directly Under the CPC Central Committee, and with the kind concern of the heads of the organs, they have gradually become the Party's close assistants and reliable reserve force, and the core for uniting and educating the young masses of the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee.
    Currently, young people in the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee account for about one-half of the total staff, of which 71 percent are Youth League members. Over the past four years, the Youth League members have led young people to actively and conscientiously participate in theoretical and policy studies and after-work cultural learning, and actively participate in various political movements. In particular, after the "Three-Anti" Movement and Party rectification studies, they have generally raised their political awareness, clearly distinguished the ideological boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and enhanced their understanding of communism and the Communist Party, thereby establishing a revolutionary outlook on life.
    Under the education of the Party and the League, Youth League members and young people love their work, actively participate in professional studies, delve into their professions, and many model figures have emerged. In the 1952 year-end work summary of the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee, 5 percent of the League members were selected as model workers of the organs, accounting for 23.6 percent of all model workers of the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee; another 3 percent of the League members received various awards. The vast number of young people and League members have actively responded to the Party's call, completed the tasks assigned by the Party. In the work of eliminating illiteracy in the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee, nearly 600 League members and young people have successively served as tutors and part-time teachers for eliminating illiteracy. "Striving to be a good League member and further striving to be a glorious Communist Party member" has become a relatively common political requirement among League members and a force driving League members forward. At present, more than one-third of the League members have formally submitted applications to the Party, and in many units, the number of League members who have formally applied to join the Party has exceeded more than half of the League members. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the League organization has carried out the work of recommending outstanding League members as targets for Party development among all League members.
    Cultural, recreational, and sports activities have always been valued in the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee. In 1951, the Party Committee entrusted this glorious task to the League organization. Since September 1951, radio exercises have been carried out in the organs. According to statistics in March 1953, the number of participants has reached 40 percent of the total number of people in the organs. Ball games were held in 1950 and 1951. In the autumn of 1952, a sports meeting was held, with 3,156 athletes participating, including staff from various positions in the organs. With the help of the Central National Defense Sports Club, training classes in sampans, motorcycles, and shooting were held. The Communist Youth League organizations directly under the CPC Central Committee often use weekend evening parties or commemorative festival performances, use unit get-togethers, and use competitions to carry out cultural and recreational activities. In addition, they also organize singing, dancing, garden parties, travel, and other activities to enliven the life of the organs.

    中共中央直属机关青年团组织
    逐渐成为党的亲密助手和可靠的后备军
    【本报讯】中国共产党中央委员会直属机关的中国新民主主义青年团组织是从一九四八年的冬天开始建立的。四年来，在青年团中央和中共中央直属机关委员会的正确领导下，在机关首长的亲切关怀下，已逐渐成为党的亲密助手和可靠的后备军，成为团结教育中共中央直属机关青年群众的核心了。
    目前中共中央直属机关的青年约占全机关工作人员的二分之一，其中百分之七十一为青年团员。四年来，青年团员带动了青年们积极认真地参加了理论、政策学习和业余文化学习，积极参加了各种政治运动，特别是经过“三反”运动与整党学习，普遍地提高了政治觉悟，划清了工人阶级与资产阶级的思想界限，提高了对共产主义与共产党的认识，从而树立了革命的人生观。
    青年团员和青年们在党和团的教育下，热爱自己的工作，积极参加业务学习，钻研业务，并出现了许多模范人物。在一九五二年中共中央直属机关年终工作总结中，有百分之五的团员被选为机关模范工作者，占全中共中央直属机关模范工作者的百分之二三点六；另有百分之三的团员得到了各种奖励。广大青年与团员，并积极响应党的号召，完成党所交给的任务，在中共中央直属机关扫除文盲的工作中，近六百名的团员和青年先后担任了扫除文盲的辅导员与兼任教员。 “努力做一个好团员，并进一步争取做一个光荣的共产党员”已成为团员中比较普遍的政治要求，成为推动团员前进的力量。目前已有三分之一以上的团员正式向党写了申请入党书，不少单位正式申请入党的团员已超过团员一半以上。在党组织的领导下，团的组织在全体团员中进行了推荐优秀团员作为党的发展对象的工作。
    文化娱乐与体育活动在中共中央直属机关一向是被重视的，一九五一年党委把这一光荣的任务交给了团的组织。从一九五一年九月份起即开展了机关的广播体操，据一九五三年三月份统计：参加的人数已达机关总人数的百分之四十；一九五○年与一九五一年，举办了球类比赛；在一九五二年秋，举办了体育运动大会，参加大会的运动员有三千一百五十六人，包括机关各个岗位上的工作人员。在中央国防体育俱乐部的帮助下，曾开办了舢板、摩托车及射击训练班。中共中央直属机关青年团的组织并经常利用周末晚会或纪念节日的演出，利用各单位联欢，利用比赛的方法来开展文化娱乐活动。此外，并分别组织歌咏、舞蹈、游园、旅行等活动，活跃了机关生活。
