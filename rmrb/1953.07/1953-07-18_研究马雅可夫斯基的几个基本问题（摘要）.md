    Several Basic Issues in the Study of Mayakovsky (Abstract)
    Soviet Union, Kang Simonov
    When Comrade Stalin defined Mayakovsky's position in Soviet literature, he called him "the best and most talented poet of the Soviet era."
    Mayakovsky is the best example in literary history of a poet who dedicated all his poetic talent to serving the people in building socialism. What are the basic characteristics of his work?
    
    Characteristics of Creation
    First and foremost is his unwavering confidence in the victory of socialism. Our country experienced many trials between 1917 and 1930. Quite a few writers were panic-stricken in the face of difficulties. But reading through Mayakovsky's eleven volumes of post-revolutionary works, one cannot find even a single line showing the slightest trace of wavering. His confidence in victory was as pure and strong as a diamond.

    This characteristic is inseparably linked to another quality of Mayakovsky, namely his Soviet patriotism, and his absolute intolerance of any phenomenon of flattery towards the bourgeois world.
    His poem "Soviet Passport" has become a poetic symbol of Soviet patriotism for our people.
    His patriotism prompted him to wage a relentless struggle against all enemies who attempted to harm the motherland. From his works, we can see him rolling up his sleeves year after year, never disdaining any humble work, and correctly doing what the Party expected of our writers: praising all that is new and progressive; ruthlessly burning away with the fire of satire all that is poisonous, dying, decaying, and hindering progress.

    Like Gorky, Mayakovsky deeply hated imperialism and never spared words to strike at it, especially American imperialism. In some essays about the United States in 1926, he wrote: "The United States... will be the last armed defender of the desperate future of the bourgeoisie... The purpose of my writing these articles is for future struggles, to guide the people to recognize both the weakness and the stubbornness of the United States."
    Another characteristic of Mayakovsky's work is his sense of responsibility as a poet of a socialist country and his deep love and loyalty to the Party. He said: "I do not separate myself from the Party, and I consider myself responsible for carrying out all the Party's resolutions, even though I do not have a Party membership card."

    Mayakovsky was a poet who spoke directly to the masses, and he wrote for the people. To become a poet of the people was his lifelong ambition. In 1930, he wrote: "Only the workers and peasants who are building our new life today, only those who are building socialism and spreading it to the world, are my true readers, and it is for them that I am a poet."

    In addition, another quality of Mayakovsky is his desire to always move forward. He never rested on his laurels, but always looked ahead.
    The above are the basic characteristics of Mayakovsky as an artist, and these characteristics are reflected in his works. We must remember these when studying his poetry.

    To get the right direction in studying Mayakovsky's works, we must first grasp the principle that Mayakovsky is a poet, and what people should be interested in is his poetry, his poetic career. His poetry is the basis for our study of his long and complex creative path. Each stage of his development must be studied with the same careful and historically faithful attitude, without any additions, subtractions, or modifications to historical facts. Stalin's praise for Mayakovsky should be a compass for Mayakovsky researchers to move towards the right path. One misconception is that because Mayakovsky is the greatest and most talented poet of the Soviet era, therefore, every line of poetry he wrote, every word he said, even if taken out of context, can necessarily be evaluated in the same way as his entire work. And whenever something seems amiss, the facts are distorted or omitted. Any exaggeration or belittling will lead to errors.
    It is incorrect to describe Mayakovsky's path of development as smooth and free of errors, to underestimate the decisive influence of the October Revolution on all his creations, and the role played by the Party in his development after the revolution, or to overestimate the value of his early pre-revolutionary poetry. There is a great distance between his early works, the tragedy "Vladimir Mayakovsky" and the long poem "Man," and the later long poem "Lenin."
    
    Periods of Creation
    Mayakovsky's creative period can be divided into three closely related stages: first, pre-revolutionary; second, the period of the civil war and the years following, until he began writing the long poem "Lenin"; third, from this poem onwards, all his subsequent creations.
    When the October Revolution came, Mayakovsky was only twenty-four years old. Although he had genius, this first stage can only be regarded as his poetic youth. During this period, his participation in Party work was extremely beneficial to him, playing a very significant role in his later life.

    During this period, the decadent trend of Futurism had a negative effect on Mayakovsky's ideological development. But it must also be pointed out that the surge of the Russian revolutionary wave and Gorky's activities had a major influence on the poet. By the time the October Revolution was approaching, he was already a poet with a clear, militant revolutionary worldview.
    It must also be pointed out that Mayakovsky joined the revolution with his own set of erroneous views, namely his views on the relationship between form and content, and his insufficient attention to cultural heritage. He believed that while destroying social forms, classical literary forms must also be destroyed. Remnants of this view continued to remain in his later works.
    But after all, he was different from the Futurists. For him, the most important thing was to smash the old social forms, while the decadents were only interested in destroying the old literary forms, but did not want to break the old social order.

    The second stage began with the October Revolution and lasted until the writing of the long poem "Lenin." He wrote countless propaganda poems, such as the famous "ROSTA Windows." After the revolution, his increased opportunities to contact the masses made his works more mass-oriented in form and more mature in ideological content.

    But the environment in which Mayakovsky was at the time was quite complex. Formalism was rampant at that time. Hidden behind extremely "leftist" words, the publication "Left Front of Art" advocating formalism appeared, and it was edited by Mayakovsky. It and some formalists, like lead blocks, held back Mayakovsky's footsteps. The formalists desperately praised his early pre-revolutionary works in an attempt to drag him backwards, but Mayakovsky moved further and further away from them and towards the peak of socialist realism.
    The appearance of the long poem "Lenin" marked the third stage of Mayakovsky's creation. This poem was a huge victory for the principles of socialist realism. Mayakovsky's works in this period are treasures of Soviet poetry. It is difficult for us to find other works in Soviet poetry that can be so harmoniously integrated with the thoughts, feelings, hopes, and ideals of Soviet people.
    The harmful tendency that exists in the study of works in this period is to regard Soviet literature at this time as if there was nothing else besides Mayakovsky's works. It seems that there were no important writers at that time such as Sholokhov, Fadeyev, Furmanov, Serafimovich, Tikhonov, Gladkov, Bedny, and others who were also the founders of the foundation of socialist realism. Another mistake is to regard Mayakovsky as someone who broke away from the great Russian classical tradition. Yet another fallacy is the unwillingness to recognize Gorky's influence on Mayakovsky, and to oppose Mayakovsky to Gorky, to oppose prose to poetry, and to insist that Mayakovsky created another special kind of socialist realism.
    
    Inheriting Mayakovsky's Tradition
    When discussing the study of Mayakovsky's works, we cannot but touch upon the question of how we inherit and develop his traditions today.

    In his youth, Mayakovsky began to oppose the capitalist system and the imperialist war. On the one hand, he attacked and satirized bourgeois society, and on the other hand, he was full of dreams about communism. He wrote epics about Lenin, and he also wrote about the achievements of the first decade of the Soviet regime. He relentlessly exposed the ugly and degenerate nature of the American capitalist system, and he also relentlessly satirized domestic evil and fraudulent dissidents. He often criticized the indifferent attitude of those who were not concerned.
    In addition to the subject matter, his creative style, rhythm, and other formal aspects are also worth learning. Mayakovsky did not deal with his subject matter as a commentator, but as an agitator, a loud-voiced leader. This attitude is exactly what we lack. One misconception that should be corrected is to think that inheriting his tradition is only equivalent to accepting his poetic form, and that the similarity of poetic form is the criterion for judging whether or not it is the Mayakovsky school of poetry. This is precisely the anti-Mayakovsky formalist tendency. They do not understand that Mayakovsky's poetic style is determined by the effectiveness of his poetry. He found the most suitable poetic form to accomplish his fighting mission.

    Another misconception is that all our Soviet poets, without exception, are more or less inheritors of Mayakovsky's tradition, so there is no need to worry, and that there are no problems with our poetry creation today.
    This conceals many shortcomings in our poetry, and in this way, poets who have produced bad works in recent years, or even those who do not produce works, as well as poets who have not fully shouldered the responsibility of agitators and have fallen behind the masses, are all forgiven together.
    The correct view should be that the great fighting tradition of the best and most talented poet of the Soviet era has not been properly inherited and developed in our poetry today, if we compare the achievements of poetry with the great achievements of the people's cause. Sometimes some people use verbal manipulation to replace the inheritance of Mayakovsky's tradition. The real inheritance should be to recognize and absorb the most meaningful events for the Party and the people in each period of national life, and then transform them into poetry, just like Mayakovsky did. Therefore, when discussing his tradition, it is irrelevant to the essence of the matter to talk about the fact that "Lenin" and "Good" both use "staircase" line breaks. The essence of the matter is that Mayakovsky wrote poems about Lenin, about the Party, and about the Soviet state. Whether today's poets follow his tradition depends on whether they do their best to rush to the same goal as Mayakovsky, and recognize their responsibilities as he did, rather than looking at whether he writes "staircase" poems.
    Mayakovsky wrote in his poems: Let us have more poets, good poets, all different kinds of poets... Yes, we want poets with "different" artistic temperaments, poets with "different" poetic styles, but not poets with "different" understandings of the mission of poetry.

    Current Achievements and Shortcomings of Poetry
    During the Great Patriotic War, our poetry, following the tradition of Mayakovsky, created many good works. These achievements, both in Russian poetry and in the poetry of other fraternal ethnic groups, cannot be ignored.
    But now we do not need to talk about our achievements here. I think that taking last year as an example, the harvest of poetry was not great, so it would be more beneficial to focus our attention on analyzing the facts that we have deviated from Mayakovsky's path in recent years, and admit our mistakes.

    For example, a few years ago, the Party called on our cultural workers to urgently fight against cosmopolitanism and the tendency to flatter the capitalist world. Writers and poets wrote articles and made speeches, but they did not express them in the form of poetry. They could often only repeat some of Mayakovsky's verses. It is always good to quote Mayakovsky's brilliant verses one more time, but this cannot fill the gap in our poetry today!
    We have also not made good use of our poetic weapons to fight against negative phenomena in life, and to expose and strike at bad people, dishonest people, flatterers, swindlers, double-dealers, and bureaucrats, as Mayakovsky did. Instead, we have entrusted this important task - satire - to a few poets who are not the most capable, who are more inclined to humor and less to satire. It is permissible that some outstanding poets have not published satirical poems in newspapers and magazines in recent years?
    This situation proves that our poets underestimate the power of satirical poetry, which is a very powerful weapon that Mayakovsky was good at.

    There is a difference between mechanical learning and creative learning. During the Great Patriotic War, some people copied Mayakovsky's working methods of "ROSTA Windows" during the Civil War, which was not creative learning. I think that if Mayakovsky were alive, he would never have created a "TASS Window" during the Patriotic War. Never! Under the new conditions, his weapons would also be new, more mass-oriented, and more powerful. His voice would be broadcast from the radio, resounding throughout the Soviet Union every morning and every evening. That is what Mayakovsky would do. This was his wish when he was alive. If he were alive, he would talk to the people with poetry, talk to the whole country; he would talk about what would happen tomorrow today, with his eyes always on tomorrow.

    The poetry columns in our newspapers are often only for embellishment and filling the page, and are published to match the essays (mostly on festive anniversaries). Mayakovsky's poems are themselves essays. They are not used as annotations and comments to match proclamations. They are themselves proclamations aimed at the most important social events. Mayakovsky's vision extended to the whole world.
    He was a podium, a speaker, a debater; sometimes shouting loudly; sometimes sneering with gritted teeth; sometimes looking into your eyes and saying simple, heartfelt words. But no matter when, he was always talking!
    Whether you recite his poems aloud or not, you always hear him speaking directly to you. This is the great power of his poetry. It is full of confidence, and this confidence is built on the poet's own confidence.

    Our task is not to childishly and blindly imitate Mayakovsky's unique tone of speaking, but to find our own voice to talk to readers, to the people, and to the country about all the events that move the people and ourselves the most, to the best of our ability, just like he did - this is our task.

    Finally, we must inherit another tradition of Mayakovsky, that is, to invest a huge amount of labor in poetry, just like he did. The poet said this at the meeting celebrating the twentieth anniversary of his own creative career in 1930:
    "Comrades, my second task is to show people the amount of work I do. Why do I do this? To let everyone know that the poet's working day is not eight hours, but sixteen or eighteen hours. The poet has a huge task to perform for the country. Let everyone know that we have no time to rest, we must constantly work with our pens every day and every hour."
    Every Soviet poet, the entire Soviet poetry community, must remember this sentence. (Translated by Si Zhenjie from "Soviet Literature" May issue, the subheadings in the text are added by the translator.)

    研究马雅可夫斯基的几个基本问题（摘要）
    苏联康·西蒙诺夫
    斯大林同志在规定马雅可夫斯基在苏联文学界所占有的地位时，称他为“苏维埃时代最优秀、最有才能的诗人”。
    马雅可夫斯基是文学史上以自己诗的才能全部为建设社会主义的人民服务的诗人的最好范例。他的创作的基本特色是什么呢？
    创作的特色
    首先，也是最重要的，是他对社会主义的胜利的坚定不移的信心。我们的国家在一九一七年到一九三○年间，曾经历了许多考验。在困难面前惊惶失措的作家为数并不少。但读遍马雅可夫斯基的十一卷革命后的著作，却找不到即使是一行显示出些微动摇的痕迹的字句。他对胜利的信心像金钢石一样纯洁和坚强。
    这一特色就不可分离地联系到马雅可夫斯基的另一品质，那就是他的苏维埃爱国主义，他绝对不能容忍任何向资产阶级世界阿谀逢迎的现象。
    他的“苏联护照”一诗已成为我国人民的苏维埃爱国主义的诗的象征。
    他的爱国主义促使他向一切企图损害祖国的敌人作无情的斗争。从他的作品中，我们可以看出他年复一年地卷起衣袖劳动，从不轻视任何低微的工作，正确地按党所期待于我们作家的去做：歌颂一切新的、进步的东西；无情地用讽刺的火去烧掉一切有毒的、垂死的、腐朽的、阻挠进步的东西。
    马雅可夫斯基像高尔基一样深刻地憎恶帝国主义，从不吝惜字句去打击帝国主义，特别是美国帝国主义。在一九二六年他在一些有关美国的散文中写道：“美国……将是资产阶级的绝望的前途的最后的武装保卫者。……我写这些文章的目的，是为了未来的斗争，引导人民去认识美国的软弱和顽强这两方面。”
    马雅可夫斯基的作品的另一特色，是他对作为一个社会主义国家的诗人的责任的观念和他对党的深刻的爱和忠心。他说：“我不把自己和党分开，我认为自己有责任去执行党的一切决议，虽则我没有党证。”
    马雅可夫斯基是一个直接向人民群众说话的诗人，他为人民写作。成为人民的诗人，便是他一生的抱负。在一九三○年他写道：“只有今天建设我们的新生活的工人和农民，只有这些建设社会主义并传播它到全世界去的人们，才是我的真正读者，我为了他们而作一个诗人。”
    此外，马雅可夫斯基的另一品质是他的永远向前进步的愿望，他从不停止在自己的荣誉上，他永远向前看。
    以上是马雅可夫斯基作为一个艺术家的基本特点，这些特点已反映在他的作品中。我们在研究他的诗的时候，必须记住这些。
    要得到研究马雅可夫斯基创作的正确方向，首先要掌握一个原则，就是：马雅可夫斯基是诗人，人们所应该感到兴趣的也就是他的诗作、他的诗的事业。他的诗才是我们研究他的长而复杂的创作道路的基础。对他的发展的每一阶段，必须加以同样周详的和忠实于历史的态度去研究，而不能对历史事实有任何增减和修饰。斯大林对马雅可夫斯基的赞美应该是马雅可夫斯基研究者走向正确道路的指南针。有一种错误观念是：因为马雅可夫斯基是苏维埃时代最伟大、最有才能的诗人，因此无论他所写的哪一行诗，他所说的哪一个字，即使孤立地举出来，也必然同样地能够用对他整个作品的评价来评价的。而凡是碰到不对头的时候，那就把事实加以曲解或略而不提。任何夸大和贬低都会造成错误。
    把马雅可夫斯基发展的道路描写为毫无波折和错误，把十月革命对他的全部创作所起的决定性影响，和党在革命后对他的发展所起的作用估计不足，把他的革命前的早期诗歌的价值估计过高，都是不正确的。他的早期作品悲剧“弗拉吉米尔·马雅可夫斯基”和长诗“人”，与后来的长诗“列宁”之间是有很大距离的。
    创作的分期
    马雅可夫斯基的创作时期可分为三个密切相联的阶段：第一，革命前；第二，内战时期及其后数年，直到开始写长诗“列宁”止；第三，从这首诗开始，一直到以后的全部创作。
    十月革命来临的时候，马雅可夫斯基还只有二十四岁，虽则他有天才，这第一阶段也只能视为他的诗歌的青年时期。在这时期中他所参加的党的工作，对他是极有益的，这在他以后的生活中起着极重大的作用。
    在这时期中，未来主义这一颓废倾向对马雅可夫斯基的思想发展是产生了反面作用的。但同时也须指出，俄罗斯的革命浪潮的高涨和高尔基的活动都给诗人以主要的影响，在十月革命临近时，他已经是一个具有明确的战斗的革命世界观的诗人了。
    另外必须指出的是：马雅可夫斯基参加到革命里来是带着他的一套错误观点的，那就是他对形式与内容的相互关系的看法，对文化遗产的不够重视，他认为在毁弃社会形式的同时，必须毁弃古典文学形式。这种观点的残余曾继续留在他以后的作品中。
    但他毕竟和未来派不同，对他说来，最重要的是粉碎旧社会形式，而颓废主义者则仅仅对破坏旧文学形式感兴趣，却并不想打破旧社会秩序。
    第二个阶段开始于十月革命，一直到长诗“列宁”的写作的时候。他写了无数宣传诗，如著名的“罗斯塔之窗”。革命后他接触群众的机会增多，使他的作品在形式上更群众化，思想内容上也趋于成熟。
    但马雅可夫斯基所处的当时的环境是够复杂的，那时候形式主义正在嚣张。掩盖在极“左”的文字后面的宣扬形式主义的刊物“左翼艺术战线”出现了，它是马雅可夫斯基编辑的。它和一些形式主义者们，像铅块一样拉住马雅可夫斯基的脚步。形式主义者们拼命颂扬他的革命前的早期作品企图拉他倒退，可是马雅可夫斯基却越来越远地离开他们并向着社会主义现实主义的高峰前进。
    长诗“列宁”的出现标志着马雅可夫斯基创作的第三个阶段。这首诗是社会主义现实主义原则的巨大胜利。马雅可夫斯基在这一时期中的作品是苏维埃诗歌的瓌宝，我们很难找到苏维埃诗歌中还有别的能够这样和谐地与苏维埃人的思想、感情、希望和理想相紧密结合在一起的作品。
    这一时期作品的研究工作方面所存在的有害倾向是把这时期的苏联文学看成除了马雅可夫斯基的作品以外，再也没有别的东西存在，好像那时候并没有萧洛霍夫、法捷耶夫、富曼诺夫、绥拉菲摩维奇、吉洪诺夫、格拉特柯夫、别德内依等重要作家存在，他们也是社会主义现实主义的基础的奠定人。另一错误是把马雅可夫斯基看作和俄罗斯伟大古典传统脱离的人。再有一种谬见就是不愿承认高尔基对马雅可夫斯基的影响，而把马雅可夫斯基与高尔基对立起来，把散文和诗对立起来，硬说马雅可夫斯基创造了另外一种特殊的社会主义现实主义。
    承继马雅可夫斯基传统
    在讨论对于马雅可夫斯基的作品研究工作时，我们不能不涉及今天我们怎样承继和发展他的传统的问题。
    马雅可夫斯基在青年时候，就开始反对资本主义制度，反对帝国主义战争。他一方面打击和讽刺资产阶级社会，一方面对共产主义充满了梦想。他写了关于列宁的史诗，也写了苏维埃政权的第一个十年的成就。他无情地揭露了美国资本主义制度的丑恶堕落的性质，也毫不懈怠地讽刺国内的罪恶的欺诈的异己分子。他经常批评那种事不关己的旁观态度。
    除了题材方面，他的创作风格、节奏等形式方面也是值得学习的。马雅可夫斯基处理他的题材时并不是以一个评论者的身份出现的，而是以一个鼓动家，一个声音洪亮的带头人的身份出现的。这种态度刚好是我们所缺少的。有一种错误观念应该纠正，就是以为承继他的传统便只等于接受他的诗歌形式，以为诗歌形式的相似是判断是否马雅可夫斯基诗派的准绳。这恰好是反马雅可夫斯基的形式主义倾向。他们不理解，马雅可夫斯基的诗歌风格是由他的诗歌的效用所决定的。他找到了最适合于完成自己的战斗任务的诗歌形式。
    另一种错误观念就是认为我们苏联诗人毫无例外地、或多或少地全是马雅可夫斯基传统的承继者，因此也就不用担心了，认为今天我们的诗歌创作情况没有什么问题了。
    这样就掩盖了我们诗歌方面的许多缺点，这样可以使近年来产生不好的作品的诗人，甚至不产生作品的诗人，以及没有充分担负起鼓动家的责任，落在群众后面的诗人们都一起得到了宽恕。
    正确的看法应该是：苏维埃时代最优秀、最有才能的诗人的伟大的战斗的传统，并没有在今天我们的诗歌中得到应有的承继和发展，如果我们把诗歌的成绩来和人民事业的伟大成就相比的话。时常有些人用文字的玩弄来代替承继马雅可夫斯基的传统。真正的承继应该是像马雅可夫斯基那样去认识、吸收国家生活中每一个时期中对党、对人民最有意义的事件，然后将它们转化而为诗。因此，在讨论他的传统时，侈谈“列宁”和“好”两首诗用的是“楼梯式”的分行，是无关问题的实质的。问题的实质是马雅可夫斯基写了关于列宁，关于党，关于苏维埃国家的诗。今天的诗人跟不跟他的传统走，就要看他是否尽自己的能力去奔赴与马雅可夫斯基相同的目标，像他那样地认清自己的责任，而不是去看他是否写“楼梯式”的诗。
    马雅可夫斯基在他诗中这样写：让我们有更多的诗人，好的诗人，各种不同样的诗人……是的，我们要有“不同样”的艺术气质的诗人，“不同样”的诗歌风格的诗人，却不是对诗的使命有“不同样”的了解的诗人。
    当前诗歌的成绩和缺点
    在伟大卫国战争中，我们的诗歌按照马雅可夫斯基的传统，创造了许多好作品。无论在俄罗斯诗歌方面，还是在其他各兄弟民族诗歌方面，这些成就都是不容忽视的。
    但现在我们不必在这里谈我们的成就，我觉得就拿去年来说，诗歌的收获是不大的，因此把我们的注意力集中在分析近年来我们离开马雅可夫斯基的道路的事实，承认我们的错误，是更为有益的。
    例如，数年前党号召我们文化工作者迫切需要向世界主义、向资本主义世界阿谀屈膝的倾向作斗争。作家和诗人都写了文章，作了演讲，可是没有用诗的形式来表现。却经常只能重复引用一些马雅可夫斯基的诗句。多引用一次马雅可夫斯基的光辉诗句，总是好的，但这却不能填补我们今天诗歌中的空白！
    对生活中的反面现象斗争，对坏人、不诚实的人、拍马者、骗子、两面派、官僚主义者的揭露和打击，我们也没有很好地像马雅可夫斯基那样运用我们的诗歌武器，却把这一重大任务——讽刺，委托给少数并不是能力最强的诗人去做，他们更多地倾向于幽默，而少讽刺。好些杰出的诗人近几年来从没有在报纸杂志上发表过讽刺诗，这是能够容许的吗？
    这种情形证明了，我们的诗人对马雅可夫斯基所擅长的讽刺诗这一有着极大威力的武器的力量是估计过低的。
    机械式的学习和创造性的学习是不同的，在伟大卫国战争时期，有些人搬用马雅可夫斯基在内战时期的“罗斯塔之窗”的工作方式，就不是创造性的学习。我以为马雅可夫斯基如果活着，决不会在卫国战争时期再来一个“塔斯之窗”的。决不！在新的条件下，他的武器也将是新的更群众化的更有力的武器。他的声音必将从无线电广播出去，每天早晨，每天黄昏，响彻全苏联。那才是马雅可夫斯基要作的。这是他活着时候的愿望。如果他活着的话，将用诗和人民谈话，和整个国家谈话；他将在今天讲明天发生的事，眼光永远向着明天。
    我们报纸上的诗歌栏时常只是为了版面的点缀、补白，为了配合论文（大多数在逢到节庆纪念的场合）而登的。马雅可夫斯基的诗却本身就是论文，它们不是作为注释和评述来配合文告，它们本身是针对最重要社会事件而发的文告。马雅可夫斯基的视野及于全世界。
    他是一个讲坛，一个谈话家，一个辩论家；有时大声疾呼；有时切齿讥讽；有时注视着你的眼睛说着朴素的知心话。但不论何时，他总是说着话！
    不管你是不是高声朗诵他的诗，你总听到他直接在向你说话。这就是他的诗歌的巨大威力。其中充满信心，这种信心是建筑在诗人自己的信心之上的。
    我们的任务不是要幼稚地盲目地模仿马雅可夫斯基所独有的声调说话，而是要像他那样，尽自己的能力，找到自己的声音来和读者、和人民、和国家谈论一切最使全国人民以及自己感动的事件——这便是我们的任务。
    最后我们要承受马雅可夫斯基的另一个传统，像他那样地对诗歌投入巨大的劳动。诗人在一九三○年庆祝他自己的创作事业二十周年的会上这样说：
    “同志们，我的第二个任务便是给人看我工作的数量。我为什么要这样呢？为了让大家知道诗人的劳动日不是八小时，而是十六小时、十八小时。诗人对国家负有巨大的工作任务。让大家知道，我们没有时间休息，我们必须用自己的笔不断地每日每时工作。”
    每一个苏联诗人、整个苏维埃诗歌界，都必须记住这句话。（斯贞节译自“苏联文学”五月号，文内插题是译者加的。）
