After hearing President Ho Chi Minh's report on the international situation and General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, on the military situation, the meeting made decisions on a number of important issues, including: (1) establishing a system for detaining landlords who violate the law, rural despots, counter-revolutionaries and other illegal elements to prevent their counter-revolutionary sabotage actions against the peasant struggle and disrupting public order and safety.
(2) To improve the people's government at the village level by making every effort to mobilize the peasant masses to implement the government's land policy. This work includes: adjusting the organization of the township people's government, dividing large townships into small townships, and improving the work style of cadres, so that the township government becomes a true people's government that is closely connected with the masses.
(3) A decision on how to implement the government's land policy in areas where the peasant masses have not yet been mobilized to carry out struggles.
(4) A decision on the management of government personnel at all levels.
