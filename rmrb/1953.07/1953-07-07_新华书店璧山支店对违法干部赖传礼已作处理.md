    Xinhua Bookstore Bishan Branch Has Dealt with Illegal Cadre Lai Chuanli
    A letter from Xinhua Bookstore Bishan Branch: The April 29th issue published a reader's criticism of our bookstore's book distribution worker Lai Chuanli for forcing the sale of books and periodicals in Tongliang County, causing a bad influence. This criticism is correct. We are now informing you of the handling of this matter and our self-criticism.
    Last October, our bookstore's book distribution worker Lai Chuanli went to Tongliang County to carry out book distribution work. He disobeyed the instructions of the local Party committee and often fabricated work achievements to deceive the leadership. He not only threatened the masses and forced quotas when selling books and periodicals, but also colluded with reactionary party members, Kuomintang members, and puppet military officers, sheltered landlords, and engaged in embezzlement. Due to the forced quotas, not only could the books and periodicals not play their due educational role, causing our bookstore to be unable to recover more than 68 million yuan in book funds, but more seriously, it caused significant losses to the masses and seriously damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government. After consulting with our county People's Government, we have handed over the illegal element Lai Chuanli to the county People's Court for handling according to law.
    The occurrence of Lai Chuanli's illegal activities is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of our store's leading comrades. When arranging work, we simply pursued distribution figures and rarely considered working methods. When we learned about the situation of book sales in Tongliang County, we did not consider whether the distribution figures exceeded objective needs, or whether there were deviations in the distribution work. Although we did not fully know about Lai Chuanli's illegal behavior beforehand, we did have some understanding; at the time, we thought that large sales figures meant that deviations were inevitable, so we did not promptly check and deal with them. In order to learn from the lessons, we have requested the higher authorities to give us the punishment we deserve, and we are determined to improve our work in the future.
    As for how to deal with the problem of the masses being forced to buy books and periodicals they do not need and the village and township cadres being forced to advance book funds, because the issue is complex, we have consulted the provincial store and sent personnel to investigate and study.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    新华书店璧山支店对违法干部赖传礼已作处理
    新华书店璧山支店来信：四月二十九日报上发表了读者批评我店书刊发行员赖传礼在铜梁县强迫推销书刊，造成恶劣影响的来信，这个批评是正确的。现在把这个问题的处理情况和我们的检讨告诉你们。
    去年十月，我店书刊发行员赖传礼到铜梁县开展书刊发行工作，他对当地党委指示阳奉阴违，并经常捏造工作成绩欺骗领导。他不但在推销书刊时威胁群众，强迫摊派；还拉拢反动党团分子和伪军官，包庇地主，并有贪污行为。由于强迫摊派，不但使书刊不能起应有的教育作用，使我店有六千八百多万元的书款收不回来；更严重的是使群众遭受重大损失，严重损害了党和人民政府的威信。经请示我县人民政府后，我们已将违法分子赖传礼送交县人民法院依法处理。
    赖传礼违法事件的发生和我店领导同志的官僚主义作风是分不开的。我们在布置工作时单纯追求发行数字，很少考虑工作方法。当知道铜梁县推销书刊的情况时，我们没有考虑发行数字是否超过客观需要，发行工作中是否有偏差。我们对赖传礼的非法行为事先虽不完全知道，但也曾有一些了解；当时我们却认为推销数字大，偏差是难免的，因而也没及时加以检查和处理。为了吸取教训，我们已请求上级给以应得处分，并决心今后切实改进工作。
    至于群众被迫买了用不着的书刊和乡、村干部被迫垫出书款的问题应怎样处理，因问题复杂，我们已请示省店，并派员调查研究。
