Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 8th - Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Just as the Korean armistice negotiations enter their third year, and Syngman Rhee, with the connivance of the United States, is doing his utmost to sabotage the armistice, Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai's letter to Clark today brings hope for an early realization of the armistice.

However, judging from all indications, if the US does not change its attitude of indulgence towards Syngman Rhee, the future of the armistice still faces a serious danger of being sabotaged.

Just as liaison officers from both sides were holding a meeting in Panmunjom, Robertson held his eleventh meeting with Syngman Rhee. Many reports say that the atmosphere in Seoul today is particularly tense, with rumors spreading that Syngman Rhee is preparing to implement new destructive actions to make the signing of an armistice agreement impossible. According to an International News Service reporter, the actions Syngman Rhee may take include: (1) "Releasing" more than 10,000 Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war on Jeju Island who are not directly repatriated; (2) "Releasing" more than 8,000 Korean People's Army prisoners of war still remaining in prisoner of war camps; and (3) Refusing to withdraw from the demilitarized zone after the signing of the armistice agreement, thereby sabotaging the implementation of the armistice.

After learning of the Korean-Chinese side's reply letter, South Korean Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai declared that the United States should give Syngman Rhee a notice three days before the signing of the armistice agreement so that Syngman Rhee could tell the United States what they intend to do. Because Syngman Rhee had promised Clark that he would notify Clark before withdrawing the Rhee puppet army from the United Nations forces. Pyun Yung-tai said that if Clark did not notify Syngman Rhee three days before the signing of the armistice agreement, then the Syngman Rhee government could not be fully responsible for the "chaos" that followed. Pyun Yung-tai's words seemed to indicate that he knew that if they were to withdraw the Rhee puppet army from Clark's command and go it alone, the United States would also indulge them.

Many reports indicate that Syngman Rhee is now convinced that if he insists on continuing to fight, the United States will definitely support him in continuing to fight. A member of the National Defense Committee, a South Korean decision-making body, revealed to a Reuters reporter yesterday that Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to sabotage the armistice is: 1. "To keep US troops stationed in Korea"; 2. "To deepen the rift between the United States and the Commonwealth"; 3. Syngman Rhee himself "bears all the blame for obstructing the armistice, thereby making it politically possible for the United States to continue fighting in Korea." This confidant of Syngman Rhee said that if an armistice agreement is signed, Syngman Rhee "will take out his last card: ordering the Rhee puppet army to attack north." He said: Syngman Rhee "firmly believes that the so-called 'suicidal offensive' or 'death-seeking battle' are nothing more than propaganda. He believes that the United States will not allow the South Korean army to be destroyed under any circumstances, and the United States will be forced to come to the rescue."

Corresponding to the words of Syngman Rhee's confidant, some American officers in Daegu have released the air that the United States "does not have a safe and secure way" to control Syngman Rhee's army "advancing north," because the United States will continue to supply them after the armistice.

It can be seen from these ulterior motives that if the US continues to adopt the indulgent attitude towards Syngman Rhee that it has adopted since the "release" of prisoners of war incident, then Syngman Rhee may completely gamble and destroy the Korean armistice. This is the real danger at present. The Korean-Chinese side has pointed out this obvious danger today and demanded that the US take effective steps to make Syngman Rhee's government and army abide by the armistice agreement and all related agreements. Syngman Rhee's spokesperson, George H. Hodge, said today: "Now everything depends on how the United Nations responds to the communist side's letter. Our attitude remains the same, nothing has changed. Let us see whether the United Nations and the communist side will use force to make us comply with the armistice." Now, people want to ask: Will the US take effective steps to make the Korean armistice, which the people of the world desire, a reality? Or will it continue to indulge Syngman Rhee and cause the armistice to be sabotaged? The US must answer with action.

### 李承晚企图实行新的破坏停战的行动  美方必须采取有效步骤加以防止

    李承晚企图实行新的破坏停战的行动
    美方必须采取有效步骤加以防止
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者江南报道：正当朝鲜停战谈判进入第三年，李承晚在美国纵容之下极力破坏停战的时候，金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员今天致克拉克的信，为早日实现停战带来了希望。
    但是从一切迹象看来，如果美方不改变他们对李承晚的纵容态度，那末停战的前途仍然有遭到破坏的严重危险。
    就在双方联络官在板门店举行会议的时候，罗伯逊又和李承晚举行了第十一次会谈。许多消息说，今天的汉城空气特别紧张，纷纷传说李承晚准备实行新的破坏行动，使签订停战协定成为不可能。据国际新闻社的记者说，李承晚可能采取的行动有：（一）“释放”在济州岛的一万多名不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员；（二）“释放”八千多名尚留在俘虏营中的朝鲜人民军被俘人员；（三）停战协定签字后拒绝撤出非军事区，从而破坏实行停战的工作。
    在得悉朝中方面的复信以后，南朝鲜的外务部长官卞荣泰就宣称，美国应该在签订停战协定之前三天给李承晚一个通知书，以便李承晚把他们打算怎么办告诉美国。因为李承晚曾经答应克拉克，他将在把李伪军撤出联合国军之前通知克拉克。卞荣泰说，如果克拉克在签订停战协定以前三天不通知李承晚，那末李承晚政府对于随后发生的“混乱”就不能完全负责。卞荣泰的这些话，好像表示他知道如果他们要把李伪军队从克拉克管辖下撤出来单独干下去，美国也是会加以纵容的。
    许多消息指出，李承晚现在深信，如果他坚持继续打下去，美国将一定支持他打下去。南朝鲜决策机关国防委员会的一个委员昨天向路透社的记者透露，李承晚破坏停战的阴谋是：一、“使美军驻在朝鲜境内”；二、“加深美国与英联邦间的裂痕”；三、由李承晚自己“承担阻碍停战的一切罪过，从而使美国在朝鲜继续作战在政治上成为可能”。这个李承晚的亲信说，如果停战协定签订，李承晚“就要拿出他最后一张牌：命令李伪军向北进攻”。他说：李承晚“深信所谓‘自杀性的进攻’或者‘找死的战斗’的说法都不过是宣传。他相信美国无论如何不会让南朝鲜军队消灭，美国是会被迫要来援助的”。
    和李承晚的亲信的话相应的，是在大邱的美国某些军官们已放出空气，说美国“没有一个安全而保险的办法”来控制李承晚的军队“北进”，因为美国在停战后仍要继续供应他们。
    从这些别有用心的话里可以看出，如果美方对李承晚继续采取自“释放”战俘事件以来所采取的那种纵容的态度，那末李承晚完全可能孤注一掷地破坏朝鲜停战。这就是目前真正的危险所在。朝中方面今天已经指出了这个显然存在的危险，并且要求美方采取有效步骤，来使李承晚的政府和军队遵守停战协定及其一切有关协议。李承晚的代言人葛弘基今天说：“现在一切要看联合国怎样答复共产党方面的信了。我们的态度仍旧是一样的，没有什么改变。我们且看联合国和共产党方面是否将使用武力来使我们遵从停战罢。”现在，人们要问：美方将要用采取有效步骤来使世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战得以实现呢？还是继续纵容李承晚而使停战遭到破坏呢？美方必须用行动来作出回答。
