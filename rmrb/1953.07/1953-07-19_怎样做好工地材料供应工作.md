How to Do a Good Job in Material Supply for Construction Sites
Liu Qingxiang

Material supply work at construction sites is an important part of completing construction tasks. In the past, many construction site material departments lacked the concept of economic accounting and didn't know how to be frugal and careful. They only focused on completing tasks without considering costs, resulting in stockpiling and waste in material supply work.

(1) Lack of attention to planning. Construction departments requested materials without prior planning, or the plans were inaccurate, or they submitted plans and demanded materials simultaneously. Material departments also had the idea of "planning generously and using sparingly, better safe than sorry." As a result, there were blind applications on one side and blind purchases on the other. After the materials were delivered to the construction site, some were not used at all, and some were only partially used. Once the project was completed, large quantities of materials had to be returned. The No. 020 construction site of the former Central Construction Engineering Department's Direct Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as the Engineering Company) had materials worth 2 billion yuan left over due to inaccurate material planning. The No. 323 construction site originally received 120 rolls of imported felt and 3,293 kilograms of imported asphalt, all of which were returned untouched.

(2) Lack of attention to procedures. Material supply procedures at construction sites were chaotic. At some construction sites of the Engineering Company, workers took materials without any procedures, taking them as they needed them. The company's No. 252 construction site had no accounts from beginning to end. As a result, many construction sites often couldn't reconcile their accounts after completion, and they couldn't produce accurate and reliable project costs.

(3) Lack of attention to material management. Many people simply regarded material work as "watching the piles." They received materials when they arrived and issued materials when they were requested. They lacked strict scientific management of bulk materials, resulting in serious waste.

(4) Lack of attention to systems. Material personnel had unclear divisions of labor and responsibilities. There were no unified systems for work. Even when there were systems, they couldn't be effectively implemented. The connection between the design, construction, and material departments was very poor. Construction departments often said, "Work is stopped waiting for materials, the material department is responsible," while material departments felt they couldn't avoid "getting blamed and abused." Whenever problems arose, they blamed and shirked responsibility to each other, and no one took responsibility.

How can we do a good job in material supply for construction sites? Based on the experience shared at the Engineering Company's material personnel training class, here are four points for your consideration:

I. Compile Material Supply Instruction Charts to Strengthen Planning Work

In planning material supply work, compiling material supply instruction charts is an effective way to improve construction site work, transform material work from passive to active, and overcome the existing chaos at construction sites. Supplying materials according to instruction charts is based on construction according to instruction charts. Its purpose is to coordinate and ensure the smooth progress of construction according to instruction charts. Its advantages are:

(1) Enables material supply to closely coordinate with rhythmic construction, avoiding large stockpiles of materials. (2) Enables each material worker to have a clear understanding, allowing them to exert their initiative and enthusiasm in their work. (3) Facilitates the division of labor and cooperation among material personnel, and mutual supervision and inspection. (4) Enables timely grasp of the overall material supply situation.

The content of the material supply instruction chart should generally include: the daily required quantity of each material (provided by the planning or construction department); the daily planned supply quantity; and the daily actual received quantity. Its compilation method and steps: First, material personnel should take the initiative to contact the construction or planning department before construction starts to obtain information such as material usage plans, material usage progress, and material analysis. Based on the structure and type of the project, review the required quantity of each material according to material usage quotas. Then, fill the reviewed required quantity into the "Required Quantity" column of the chart. Second, material personnel should separately compile material application, procurement, and transportation plans based on the construction sequence, material usage quantity and time, material sources, transportation conditions, seasonal changes, on-site storage capacity, warehouse equipment, and last year's on-site supply experience, and determine the daily planned supply quantity, filling it into the "Planned Supply Quantity" column of the chart. Third, the actual received materials each day should be recorded in detail in the material receipt details table and also recorded in the "Actual Received Quantity" column of the chart at any time.

II. Conscientiously Do Material Sales Statistics

In construction site material supply work, material sales is a very complex, meticulous, and important task. Thousands of materials are transported to the construction site according to the needs of on-site construction and then correctly issued for use in each project. This requires several processes and multiple procedures. In the past, the bricks, tiles, lime, sand, and stones at most construction sites were arbitrarily taken by the workers without any procedures. Some construction sites even did this with timber and cement. As for those construction sites that started without accounts and later made them up, as well as those that never had accounts, naturally, they wouldn't pay attention to material sales work. This wouldn't lead to correct project costs. Therefore, in order to correctly calculate costs and further achieve cost management, construction site material departments should strictly follow material requisition and issuance procedures and conscientiously do the following tasks based on the on-site construction situation and the needs of cost accounting.

(1) Workers must first audit material requisitions according to the project material usage plan before issuing materials. Materials should not be issued if there is no plan or if the requisition exceeds the plan without approval from superiors and the person in charge of the material department. In the past, the No. 215 construction site initially implemented planned management in material supply through this method.

(2) Based on the on-site construction situation, universally achieve material sales by work order number. At the same time, strive to focus on achieving material sales by each project item. Last year, some construction sites implemented material sales by work order number, and the No. 020 construction site also focused on implementing itemized material sales for two work order numbers. In the future, we need to rely on the masses better and conscientiously implement this.

(3) Establish necessary ledgers and statistical reports. Material receipts and issues must be promptly recorded in the accounts and must not be delayed. The actual quantity of materials used for each work order number or sub-item project should also be statistically compiled regularly in order to grasp the material usage situation of the project.

III. Strengthen On-Site Material Management

On-site material management generally includes acceptance, storage, supervision of material usage, fire safety, and other work.

How can we do a good job in on-site material management? Here are a few suggestions:

(1) Set up material storage signs. After the materials are transported to the construction site, outdoor materials such as bricks, tiles, lime, sand, and stones should be stacked separately at appropriate locations according to the material layout plan. Indoor materials such as cement and small hardware should be stacked separately according to the warehouse equipment situation. A material storage sign should be hung on each type of material to record material dynamics at any time.

(2) Appropriately store and regularly inspect various materials of different varieties, specifications, and properties to avoid moisture, decay, rust, stockpiling, and cracking. Flammable materials such as wood, oil, and hemp should have sufficient fire-fighting equipment to strictly prevent fire hazards. To do this well, special attention should be paid to strengthening the sense of responsibility of the material workers.

(3) Pay attention to mastering a certain amount of inventory. In the past, material supply at construction sites mostly relied on a large amount of reserves to ensure construction needs. As a result, large quantities of materials were returned after the completion of many construction sites. Under the requirements of economic accounting at construction sites, this will make capital turnover difficult and affect normal supply. Therefore, in order to better complete the task of material supply at construction sites, the material departments must be good at mastering the regularity of supply work, find out the normal material inventory that is supplied in batches according to the construction sequence based on the daily project material usage quantity, the material delivery interval, and the size of the storage yard or warehouse, so that it will not cause work stoppages due to waiting for materials, nor will it cause large quantities of materials to be stockpiled and stagnant.

(4) Supervise material usage. Saving and rationally using materials is one of the best ways to reduce project costs. However, many construction site material departments mistakenly believe that this work is only the responsibility of the construction department, so they have not paid enough attention to this issue, resulting in great waste and losses. In addition, strictly preventing the use of high-quality materials for inferior purposes and the recycling and utilization of residual and obsolete materials are also very important issues. Construction site material departments should pay attention to this.

IV. Rely on the Masses to Establish Various Responsibility Systems

In order to ensure that the above tasks are done well, each construction site material department must quickly establish a complete set of material supply management systems. In material supply, such as material planning application, procurement, transportation, material issuance, material accounting, etc., the principles of simplifying procedures and clarifying responsibilities should be followed, and regulations should be made separately in the systems. In terms of material management, for material acceptance, storage, material storage quantity and usage supervision, and the utilization and recycling of residual and obsolete materials, detailed, strict, and scientific management methods should also be formulated based on the principle of economy.

When establishing these systems, it is first necessary to widely mobilize the masses so that the systems meet with the masses. They must also be fully deliberated, discussed, supplemented, and revised by the masses. Then, rely on the masses to consciously abide by and ensure the implementation of the systems.

On the other hand, within the construction site material department, cadres should also be appropriately equipped according to the size of the project area and the various businesses of the supply work, and specific divisions of labor should be carried out to establish a division of labor and responsibility system. Implementing a system of precise division of labor and specific personnel responsibility is the main method of promoting work. This work is also of great importance to the quality of material supply at construction sites.

With a division of labor, close cooperation is also needed. Having only a division of labor without cooperation, or cooperating poorly, can easily cause work to be disconnected. In the past, many construction sites used daily meeting to strengthen the connection between material workers. This method can also be tried and adopted by various construction sites.

In addition to the above four tasks, material workers themselves should also work hard to study, improve themselves, establish an overall concept and economic accounting thinking, strengthen their sense of responsibility at work, and resolutely overcome the supply system thinking. At the same time, they should also constantly study their business, be familiar with the names, specifications, performance, and management methods of various materials. In their work, they should closely rely on the masses, strengthen unity, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and promptly summarize experience, correct shortcomings, and improve work in order to better coordinate with on-site construction and successfully complete this year's basic construction tasks.

    怎样做好工地材料供应工作
    刘庆祥
    工地材料供应工作，是完成建设任务重要的一环。过去，因为许多工地材料部门，缺乏经济核算的观点，不知道精打细算，只顾完成任务，不去考虑成本，因而，造成材料供应工作中的积压与浪费现象。
    （1）不重视计划。施工部门要材料，事先不作计划，或计划不准确，或一手提计划，一手就要材料。材料部门也有“宽打窄用，有备无患”的想法。因此，一边是盲目申请，一边是盲目采购。材料运到工地后，实际上有的不用，有的只用一部分。工程一结束，只好大批退料。前中央建筑工程部直属工程公司（以下称工程公司）○二○工地由于材料计划不准确，到完工时，剩下了价值二十亿元的材料。三二三工地原领进口油毡一二○卷，进口沥青三、二九三公斤，原封未动，全部退回。
    （2）不重视手续。工地供应材料，手续紊乱。在工程公司有些工地里，工人领料没有手续，随用随拿。该公司二五二工地，自始至终，根本无账。结果，许多工地结束后，往往都算不清账。也作不出精确可靠的工程成本。
    （3）不重视材料管理。很多人都把材料工作单纯看成是“看堆”。来料就收，领料就发。对大宗材料缺乏严格的科学管理，浪费现象十分严重。
    （4）不重视制度。材料人员分工不明，职责不清。工作上没有统一制度。有制度的也不能切实贯彻，设计、施工、材料三个部门之间联系很差。施工部门动辄就说“停工待料，材料上负责”，材料部门认为自己总免不了“挨打受气”。每当发生问题，就互相责难、推诿，无人负责。
    怎样做好工地材料供应工作呢？根据工程公司材料人员训练班所交流的经验，提出下列四点，供大家研究。
    一、编制供料指示图表，加强计划工作
    在计划材料供应工作中，编制供料指示图表，是作好工地工作，使材料工作由被动转为主动，克服工地现存混乱现象的有效办法。按指示图表供应材料是以按指示图表施工为基础的。其目的在于配合与保证按指示图表施工的顺利进行。它的优点是：
    （1）使材料供应密切配合有节奏的施工，避免大量积压材料。（2）使每个材料员心中有数，能够发挥材料人员在工作中的主动性和积极性。（3）便于材料人员分工合作，互相督促检查。（4）能够及时掌握全盘供料情况。
    供料指示图表的内容，一般应包括有：每种材料的每日需用量（由计划或施工部门提出）；每日计划供应量；每日实收数量。它的编制方法和步骤：第一，材料人员应在开工前主动向施工或计划部门联系，取得用料计划、用料进度、材料分析等资料。根据工程的结构和型式按用料定额审核每种材料的需用量。然后把已经审核过的需用量分别填入图表的“需用量”栏内。第二，材料人员根据施工顺序、用料数量和时间、材料来源、运输条件、季节变化、现场储料能力、仓库设备以及去年的现场供料经验，分别编制材料申请、采购与运输计划，确定每日计划供应数量，填入图表的“计划供应量”栏内。第三，每日实收材料，除应详细登录收料明细表外，并随时记入图表的“实收数量”栏内。
    二、认真作好销料统计
    在工地材料供应工作中，销料是一件很复杂、很细致、很重要的工作。上千种的材料，按现场施工的需要，有计划的运到工地，再正确的发给每一工程上使用。其中需要若干过程和多次手续。过去，
    一般工地的砖、瓦、灰、砂、石都是由工人们任意取用，没有手续。有些工地连木材、水泥也是这样，至于那些开始无账，以后补账的工地，以及始终无账的工地，自然更不会注意销料工作。这样也不会有正确的工程成本。因此，为了正确核算成本，进
    一步作到成本管理，工地材料部门应该根据现场施工情况和成本核算的需要，严格领发料手续，认真作好下列几项工作。
    （1）工人领料，必须按照工程用料计划，先行审核，然后发料。无计划或超过计划领料的，非经上级批准和材料部门负责人同意，不得发料。过去，二一五工地就是通过这种办法，初步的贯彻了材料供应中的计划管理工作。
    （2）根据现场施工情况，普遍作到按工号销料。同时，还应争取重点作到按每一工程项目销料。去年有些工地曾经实行了按工号销料，○二○工地也曾经有重点地把两个工号实行了分项销料。今后还需要更好的依靠群众，认真贯彻。
    （3）建立必要的账册和统计报表。收发材料必须及时登账，不得稽延。各工号或分项工程实际用料数量，亦应定期作出统计，以便掌握工程用料情况。
    三、加强现场材料管理
    现场材料管理，一般不外乎验收、保管、监督用料，消防安全等工作。
    怎样才能作好现场材料管理，特提出以下几点意见：
    （1）设立存料牌。材料运入工地后，库外材料如砖、瓦、灰、砂、石等等，应按材料布置图，库内材料如水泥、小五金……应根据仓库设备情况，分别堆放在适当地点，并在每种材料上挂一存料牌，随时记载材料动态。
    （2）分别各种不同材料的品种、规格和性质，适当保管，经常检查。避免受潮、腐朽、生锈、积压和干裂。易燃材料如木材、油类、麻刀等，应有足够的消防设备，严防火患。要做好这一些，特别要注意加强材料员的责任心。
    （3）注意掌握一定数量的库存。过去工地的材料供应，大部分都是依靠了大量储备来保证施工需要的。结果就造成许多工地结束后的大批退料。在工地经济核算的要求下，这就会使资金周转困难，影响正常的供应。因此，为了更好的完成工地材料供应的任务，工地材料部门必须善于掌握供应工作中的规律性，根据每日工程用料数量和进料间隔时间以及货场或仓库的大小，找出按施工顺序分批供应的正常的材料库存量，使之既不会引起工程的停工待料，也不致使大批材料积压和呆滞。
    （4）监督材料使用。节约、合理的使用材料，是降低工程成本的最好方法之一。但是，许多工地材料部门都错误地认为这一工作只是施工部门的事，以致没有引起对这个问题的足够重视，因此，造成很大的浪费和损失。此外，严格制止优材劣用以及回收和利用残废呆料的问题，也都很重要。工地材料部门应该加以注意。
    四、依靠群众建立各项责任制
    为了保证做好上述各项工作，各个工地材料部门必须迅速建立一套完整的材料供应管理制度。在材料供应上，如材料的计划申请、采购、运输发料、料账处理等，应本着简化手续，明确责任的原则，分别在制度中加以规定。在材料管理方面，对于材料验收、保管、材料储存数量与使用监督以及残废呆料的利用与回收等，亦应本着节约原则，制订出详细的严格的科学管理办法。
    建立这些制度时，首先必须广泛的发动群众，使制度和群众见面。并须经过群众充分的酝酿、讨论、补充和修改。然后依靠群众自觉的遵守，保证制度贯彻实现。
    另一方面，在工地材料部门内部，还应该根据工程面积大小，以及供应工作的各项业务，适当配备干部，进行具体分工，建立分工负责制。实行精密分工、专人负责的制度，是推动工作前进的主要方法。这一工作，对于工地材料供应的好坏，关系也很重大。
    有了分工，还需要密切合作。仅有分工而不合作，或合作得不好，就很容易使工作脱节。过去许多工地利用每天一次的碰头会来加强材料员之间的联系。这一方法，各工地也可以试行采用。
    除上述四项工作外，在材料员本身，还应该努力学习，提高自己，树立整体观念和经济核算思想，加强工作责任心，坚决克服供给制思想。同时，还应该不断的钻研业务，熟悉各种材料的品名、规格、性能和管理方法。在工作中紧密地依靠群众，加强团结，开展批评与自我批评，及时总结经验，改正缺点，提高工作。以便更好的配合现场施工，胜利地完成今年的基本建设任务。
