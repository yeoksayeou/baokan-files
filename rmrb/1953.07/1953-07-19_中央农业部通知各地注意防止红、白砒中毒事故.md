The Central Ministry of Agriculture Notifies All Regions to Prevent Accidents of Red and White Arsenic Poisoning
　　The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture recently notified all regions to pay attention to preventing accidents of red and white arsenic poisoning.
　　The notification said: In the past two years, various regions have achieved certain results in using red and white arsenic to control underground pests. However, due to insufficient publicity and education on the use, storage, and extreme toxicity of arsenic, poor packaging, lax storage, and free sales, accidental ingestion and misuse, resulting in human and animal poisoning accidents, have occurred in various regions. In order to prevent the occurrence of such serious accidents in the future, the notification requires all regions to seriously study and implement the following measures:
　　1. Use local dialects to compile simple explanations, pictures, and other various methods to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity, and repeatedly explain in detail the use, storage methods, and precautions for red and white arsenic.
　　2. Try using kraft paper packaging. Red and white arsenic currently in the hands of public-owned units or private merchants that are poorly packaged should be repackaged. Red arsenic should be ground into fine powder. Divide it into two types of packages, half-ounce or one-ounce, and print poisoning pictures on the package, briefly explaining the usage and precautions (including burning the package paper after use). In areas with conditions, bottles can be used, and the instructions attached to the bottle should state "After use, the inside and outside of the bottle must be thoroughly cleaned."
　　3. White arsenic powder should be mixed with a distinctive color, preferably red, by the factory at the place of production. The existing stock in the hands of public-owned units or private merchants should be notified by the local agricultural departments to mix the color themselves.
　　4. Public-owned units or private merchants engaged in the operation of red and white arsenic must purchase it with a certificate from their superior agency or the local industry and commerce association. When selling to farmers, a certificate from the township head or village head is required, and the certificate is kept by the seller.
　　5. When transporting, mixing, and grinding red and white arsenic, wear masks and tighten cuffs and trouser legs to prevent intrusion into the respiratory tract and contact with the skin. The utensils for mixing poisonous grains must be dedicated to this purpose and not used for mixing food, feed, or holding water; if it is impossible to have dedicated utensils, they must be thoroughly cleaned after use.
　　6. Pay attention to summarizing the effective emergency methods of local people and Chinese and Western medicine.
　　Other pesticides, such as sodium fluorosilicate, lead arsenate, calcium arsenate, and 666, are all toxic pesticides. The notification requires all regions to handle them with reference to the above points. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央农业部通知各地注意防止红、白砒中毒事故
    中央人民政府农业部最近通知各地注意防止红、白砒中毒事故。
    通知说：两年来各地用红、白砒防治地下害虫，已获得一定效果。但由于对砒的使用、保管及其剧烈毒性的宣传教育不够，包装很差，保管不严，以及自由贩卖等关系，致各地历次发生误食误用，人畜中毒事故。为防止今后这类严重事故的发生，通知要求各地认真研究和执行以下办法：
    一、用当地方言编写浅说、图画以及用其他各种方式进行广泛深入的宣传，反复详细说明红、白砒的用途、保管方法及应注意事项。
    二、试用牛皮纸包装。现存公营单位或私商手中的红、白砒包装不善的，应重行包装。红砒要研成细末。分半两装或一两装两种，包皮上印制中毒图画，简单扼要地说明用法与注意事项（包括用完后将包皮纸烧去）。有条件的地区，可用瓶装，瓶上所贴的说明中应注明“用完后必须把瓶的内外充分清洗干净”。
    三、白砒粉末一律由产地工厂负责搀着显著颜色，最好是用红色。现存公营单位或私商手中的，由当地农业部门通知其自行搀色。
    四、经营红、白砒的公营单位或私商，须凭其上
    一级机关或当地同业工会、工商联合会的证明文件购买。售给农民时，须由乡长或村长证明，证明文件由售方保存。
    五、搬运、调和、碾捣红、白砒时，要带口罩，扎紧袖口和裤脚，防止侵入呼吸器管和接触皮肤。拌毒谷的用具，须专具专用，不要兼做拌盛食物、饲料以及盛水、取水之用；如实不能专备用具，用后必须充分清洗干净。
    六、注意总结当地群众与中西医的有效的救急方法。
    其他农药如氟矽酸钠、砒酸铅、砒酸钙、六六六等，都是有毒性的农药，通知要求各地参照上述各点进行处理。（新华社）
