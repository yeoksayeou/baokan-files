The people of the capital warmly welcome the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The people of the capital believe that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the result of the joint struggle by the people of China and North Korea and peace-loving people all over the world for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In this struggle, the people of the capital have gloriously contributed their strength. From June 1951 to April 1952, the people of the capital donated 93 fighter planes. In the 1952 patriotic production increase and economy drive, workers and staff in the city overfulfilled the production increase and economy plan by 146.6 percent, increasing the country's wealth by more than 1,170 billion yuan. More than 1,200 railway employees in the capital volunteered to go to Korea to participate in transportation work. Those who have made great contributions to the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle expressed great joy and relief upon hearing the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. More than 6,000 voters who were voting at eight polling stations were even more encouraged by this victory. Liu Bin, a family member of a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who was voting, said: We have won the victory against the war of aggression, we have also achieved the victory of democratic construction, and we are also striving for the victory of the motherland's economic construction. Many workers and staff of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a forum during the lunch break after hearing the broadcast, celebrating the Korean armistice and expressing unanimous support for the armistice agreement.

While celebrating the victory of peace, the people of the capital remain highly vigilant against the enemies of peace. Liu Dezhen, director of the turbine workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant and a national model worker, said: The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue still requires further efforts from the people of China and North Korea and peace-loving people all over the world. He expressed that he would do a good job in the work plan in August and strengthen the struggle to defend peace with more practical actions to build the motherland better. In a hospital in Beijing, the returned wounded soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army immediately showed victorious smiles on their faces after hearing the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The people of the capital are further developing their enthusiasm and strength, intensifying the economic construction of the motherland, and making greater contributions to the cause of defending peace. In order to increase production, produce more iron, accelerate the economic and national defense construction of the motherland, and support the economic recovery of the Korean people, the blast furnace automation research group of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has decided to start ahead of schedule the research on the instruments and equipment for the automation of the two blast furnaces, which was originally planned to be researched in August.

    首都各界人民表示热烈欢迎
    首都各界人民热烈欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签字。
    首都人民认为朝鲜停战协定的签字，是中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一道为和平解决朝鲜问题而斗争的结果。在这个斗争中，首都人民曾经光荣地献出了自己的力量。在一九五一年六月到一九五二年四月的期间，首都人民曾捐献了战斗机九十三架。全市职工在一九五二年爱国增产节约运动中，超额地完成了增产节约计划的百分之一百四十六点六，为国家增产的财富达一万一千七百多亿元。首都志愿赴朝参加运输工作的铁路员工先后达一千二百多人。这些为抗美援朝斗争作过巨大贡献的人们，在听到朝鲜停战协定签字的消息后，都表示十分欢乐和欣慰。正在八处选民站里投票的六千多选民都为这一胜利而更加欢欣鼓舞。正在投票的选民——中国人民志愿军军人家属刘斌说：我们赢得了反对侵略战争的胜利，我们又取得民主建设的胜利，我们也正在争取祖国经济建设的胜利。石景山钢铁厂不少职工在中午听到广播后的休息时间内举行了座谈会，庆祝朝鲜停战，并对停战协定表示一致拥护。
    首都人民在庆祝和平的胜利的同时，仍然对和平的敌人保持着高度的警惕。石景山发电厂汽机场场主任、全国劳动模范刘德珍表示：朝鲜停战协定的签字，是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步，但是，整个朝鲜问题的和平解决，还有待于中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的进一步努力，他表示要在八月份做好作业计划，用更好地建设祖国的实际行动来加强保卫和平的斗争。在北京某医院里，中国人民志愿军归国伤员们听到朝鲜停战协定签字的消息后，他们的脸上立即出现了胜利的笑容。
    首都人民正在进一步发挥自己的热情和力量，加紧进行祖国的经济建设，为保卫和平的事业作出更大的贡献。石景山钢铁厂高炉自动化研究小组为了提高生产，多多出铁，加速祖国经济和国防建设，支援朝鲜人民的经济恢复工作，已决定提前开始研究原计划在八月份研究的两个高炉自动化的表计和设备工作。（据新华社讯）
