    Strengthen Production Leadership to Ensure Completion of the National Production Plan
    According to incomplete statistics from several central industrial departments, the completion of production tasks by some state-owned factories and mines in the first half of this year is unsatisfactory. From January to June, the various factories and mines under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry completed the state plan in terms of total production value. However, nine out of twenty-two major products failed to meet the plan. Among them, the Bureau of Iron and Steel failed to meet the plan in three out of five months. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry's coal production in terms of output, quality, efficiency, safety, and cost, all failed to meet the plan. Only about 94.6 percent of the national coal production plan was completed in the first half of the year. Key coal-producing areas such as the Northeast region and key units such as the Kailuan and Fushun Mining Bureaus failed to meet the plan. In electricity production, power generation and reduction of coal consumption also failed to reach the state targets. From January to May, fourteen out of twenty-eight major products under the Central First Ministry of Machine Building failed to meet the plan. The above situations show that the phenomenon of not completing production tasks is very serious. If the various departments do not quickly take effective measures to reverse this situation, there is a danger that the annual plan will not be completed, which will affect the planned economic construction.
    Some people suspect: Is it because this year's plan is set too high that many factories and mines are failing to complete their tasks? Is it necessary to revise the plan and lower some indicators so that the plan can be completed smoothly in the second half of the year? We say, no, this statement is just an excuse for conservatives to cover up their backward enterprise management. This year's plan has been fully discussed by the masses and is generally said to be relatively advanced, requiring subjective efforts to complete; but it is not rash, because it is based on the existing foundation (the 1952 production level) and calculated the potential forces that can be brought into play. Many advanced enterprises have already completed and overfulfilled their production tasks in the first half of the year, which is the most powerful proof. A concrete analysis of the main factors affecting enterprises' completion of the plan shows that the problem lies not in the plan being too high, but in the enterprise leaders (including the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League) not being sufficiently aware of the new situation this year, and failing to make the greatest efforts to improve the enterprise management level, strengthen the ideological and political work of the enterprise, fully mobilize the masses, overcome difficulties, and complete the production tasks.
    The failure of many factories and mines to complete the production plan for the first half of the year is primarily due to the chaotic enterprise management and the inability to carry out production evenly. Since the second quarter of this year, although various regions have launched work to strengthen planning management on the basis of discussing the plan, many departments and enterprises have not tightly grasped this central task, or the methods are not correct, and they have not grasped the central link, so they have not effectively improved the management level and changed the backward production situation. In addition to the improvement in production in some areas (according to statistics from 118 enterprises in the Northeast region in April, 54.2 percent of the units completed their tasks; according to statistics from 154 enterprises in May, 55.8 percent of the units completed their tasks), and a few advanced units that have been able to complete the state plan evenly (such as the Ironmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which has been able to complete the plan on a daily basis since June), the vast majority of factories and mines still rely on crash production to complete their production tasks. As a result of crash production, equipment cannot be repaired on time, safety technical regulations cannot be well implemented, and large and small personal and equipment accidents occur frequently, resulting in quality fluctuations, increased reject rates, wage overruns, and increased costs. In order to complete the total value of product tasks, some units do not produce according to the national plan, using secondary products to make up for the main products, reducing or not trial-producing new products, and producing more old products. In order to rush the production tasks in the first period, some units do not hesitate to use a large number of spare parts reserves for the next period, which aggravates the imbalance in production in the next period. In order to rush output in the fourth quarter of 1952, the Fangshan Mine in Jingxi neglected tunneling, resulting in a sharp decline in output in the first quarter of this year. Taking the output in December of last year as 100, it dropped to 38.1 in January of this year, 9.7 in February, and 27.18 in March.
    Secondly, the chaos in enterprise management is also manifested in the serious phenomenon of no one being responsible in production. In strengthening planning management, although some factories and mines have compiled operation plans, no one checks the daily implementation of the plan; no one solves the problem of untimely technical supply and lack of coordination between departments, workshops, and work sections, resulting in frequent interruptions in production; no one is responsible for the maintenance and repair of important equipment, resulting in constant accidents. For example, due to the continuous occurrence of accidents in blast furnaces in the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Iron and Steel Bureau system, pig iron failed to complete the state plan from January to May; many factories and mines have no one responsible for safety technology, and the recent water inrush accident in the Jingxing Coal Mine and the roof collapse accident in the Tonghua Shiren Coal Mine were caused by no one being responsible. As for the phenomenon of unsound technical management systems, non-implementation of operating procedures, non-strict inspection systems, and large-scale scrapping and rework of products, which affect the completion of the plan, is even more common.
    Finally, the weakness of ideological and political work in enterprises, the failure to fully utilize the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, the failure to promote advanced experiences, and the lax labor discipline are also important factors affecting the failure to complete the plan. The experience of the 1952 Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement proves that launching a movement among the masses to find tricks, tap potentials, and make rationalization proposals, and vigorously promoting advanced experiences that play a decisive role around the central work, is an important method for completing the production plan. In the first half of this year, many enterprises have obviously relaxed this work. Not only are many new creations left to fend for themselves, but also many old advanced experiences have not been consolidated and improved. The phenomenon of lax labor discipline and low attendance rates is extremely common. The various units under the Northeast Coal Mining Administration were absent from work for 586,338 workdays in the first quarter, which is equivalent to 102,760 tons less coal produced.
    It can be seen that in order to change the current production situation, the key lies in strengthening planning management, establishing a responsibility system, strengthening the ideological and political work of the enterprise, and strengthening labor discipline. The central link in doing these tasks well lies in strengthening the specific leadership of enterprises. This requires enterprise leaders to study their business and continuously improve the management level of enterprises. At present, many people do not have a sufficient understanding of this. Some mistakenly believe that the state places capital construction in the primary position, and production is unimportant. Some are busy with daily affairs all day long and ignore the major problems in the enterprise, handing over the central task of planning management to section chiefs and staff members. Some major leading cadres of departments do not provide specific leadership for the central work. They make reports and issue instructions, and think that everything is fine. They neither conduct in-depth inspections of the progress of the central work, nor summarize the experiences and lessons of the central work. Therefore, they cannot improve the management level of the cadres of the affiliated enterprises, nor can they reverse the serious situation of long-term failure to complete the plan. Leading cadres at all levels of enterprises must face up to this shortcoming and immediately change this "general" leadership style. They must firmly grasp the central work, personally study the production situation of some key factories and mines, raise problems, summarize experiences, and guide the progress of the central work. Therefore, the task is to require us to learn enterprise management and to become experts in enterprise management. Only in this way can we overcome the chaos in enterprise production and complete this year's production plan evenly.

### 加强生产领导保证完成国家生产计划

    加强生产领导保证完成国家生产计划
    根据中央几个工业部门的不完全的统计，今年上半年若干国营厂矿完成生产任务的情况是不能令人满意的。中央重工业部各厂矿一月至六月按生产总值计，虽然完成了国家计划，但在二十二种主要产品中，有九种没有完成计划，其中钢铁局五个月中有三个月没有完成计划，中央燃料工业部煤矿工业的产量、质量、效率、安全、成本等都没有完成计划。上半年只完成了国家产煤计划百分之九十四点六左右。产煤的重点地区如东北区，重点单位如开滦、抚顺等矿务局都没有完成计划。电业生产中发电量和减少煤耗等也都没有达到国家指标。中央第一机械工业部一至五月二十八种主要产品中十四种都没有完成计划。以上各种情况，说明完不成生产任务的现象是十分严重的。各部门如不迅速采取有效措施，扭转这种局面，不但使全年计划有完不成的危险，且将影响有计划经济建设的进行。
    有人怀疑：很多厂矿完不成任务，是不是因为今年的计划订得高了？是不是需要修改一下计划，降低一些指标，以便下半年顺利地完成计划呢？我们说，不是的，这种说法只是保守主义者掩盖其企业管理落后的一种藉口而已。今年计划经过群众充分讨论，一般说是较为先进的，需要经过主观努力才能完成的；但不是冒进的，因为它是根据现有的基础（一九五二年的生产水平），计算了可能发挥的潜在力量制订出来的。许多的先进企业已经完成和超额完成了上半年的生产任务就是最有力的证明。具体分析那些影响企业完成计划的主要因素，就可以看出问题不在于计划过高，而在于企业的领导者
    （包括党、政、工、团各方面）对于今年的新情况认识不足，没有以最大努力提高企业的管理水平，加强企业的思想政治工作，充分地发动群众，克服困难，完成生产任务。
    很多厂矿没有完成上半年生产计划，首先是由于企业管理混乱，生产不能均衡地进行。今年第二季度以来，虽然各地都在讨论计划的基础上展开了加强计划管理工作，但是由于许多部门和企业对这一中心工作抓得不紧，或者作法不对头，没有抓住中心环节，因而还没有有效地提高管理水平和改变生产落后的状况。除了部分地区生产情况有了好转
    （据东北地区四月份一百一十八个企业的统计，完成任务的单位占百分之五十四点二；五月份一百五十四个企业的统计，完成任务的单位占百分之五十五点八），少数先进单位已能均衡地完成国家计划
    （如鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂等单位六月份以来已能按日完成计划）外，绝大多数厂矿还是靠突击来完成生产任务。突击的结果，使得设备不能按期检修，安全技术规程不能很好贯彻，经常发生大大小小的人身与设备事故，使得质量波动，废品率上升，工资超支，成本提高。有些单位为了完成产品总值任务，不按国家计划进行生产，以次要产品弥补主要产品，少试制或不试制新产品，多生产旧产品。有些单位为了突击第一期生产任务，不惜大量动用下期的零配件储备量，加重了下期生产的不均衡。京西房山矿一九五二年第四季度为了突击产量，忽视掘进，以致今年第一季度的产量急剧下降。如以去年十二月的产量为一百，今年一月下降至三十八点一，二月下降至九点七，三月下降至二十七点一八。
    其次企业管理的混乱还表现在生产中存着严重无人负责现象。在加强计划管理中，有的厂矿虽然编制了作业计划，但是计划逐日执行的情况无人检查；技术供应不及时，各部门、各车间、各工段互不配合的问题无人解决，以致生产经常中断；重要设备的维护检修无人负责，以致事故不断发生。如中央重工业部钢铁局系统由于高炉不断发生事故，一月至五月生铁竟未完成国家计划；许多厂矿安全技术无人负责，最近的井陉煤矿的透水事故，通化石人煤矿的冒顶事故等都是因为无人负责造成的。至于技术管理制度不健全、操作规程不贯彻、检验制度不严格、产生产品大量报废、返工，影响计划完成的现象更为普遍。
    再次企业中思想政治工作薄弱，职工劳动积极性与创造性没有充分发挥，先进经验没有推广，劳动纪律松懈，也是影响计划不能完成的重要因素。一九五二年增产节约运动经验证明，在群众中展开找窍门、挖潜力与提合理化建议运动，围绕着中心工作大力推广有决定性作用的先进经验，是完成生产计划的重要方法。今年上半年，许多企业显然放松了这一工作，不但许多新的创造听其自生自灭，旧有的许多先进经验也没有巩固与提高。劳动纪律松懈，出勤率低的现象极为普遍。东北煤矿管理局所属各单位，第一季度即缺勤五十八万六千三百三十八个工，等于少出煤十万零二千七百六十吨。
    由此可见，为了改变目前的生产情况，关键在于加强计划管理，建立责任制度，加强企业的思想政治工作，加强劳动纪律。而作好这些工作的中心环节又在于加强企业的具体领导。这就要求各企业领导干部必须钻研业务，必须不断地提高企业的管理水平。目前不少人对这一点是认识不足的。有的错误地认为国家把基本建设放在首要地位，生产就无关紧要了。有的终日忙于日常事务，忽略了企业里的重大问题，把计划管理这一中心工作交给科长科员去管。有些部门主要领导干部对中心工作也不进行具体领导，作了报告，发了指示，就算万事大吉。他们既不深入检查中心工作的进行情况，也不总结中心工作的经验教训，因此，既不能提高所属企业干部的管理水平，也就不能扭转长期完不成计划的严重局面。各级企业领导干部必须正视这一缺点，立即改变这种“一般化”的领导作风，必须抓紧中心工作，必须亲自研究一些重点厂矿的生产情况，提出问题，总结经验，指导中心工作的进行。因此，任务就是要我们学会企业管理，要我们成为企业管理的内行。只有如此，才能克服企业生产的混乱现象，才能均衡地完成今年生产计划。
