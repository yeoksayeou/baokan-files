Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: The music and dance performance by the Indian Art Delegation, co-sponsored by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, grandly opened at the Beijing Youth Palace Theater on the evening of the 23rd.

Attending the opening ceremony were leading members of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, representatives of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, figures from literary, drama, film, music, dance, and art circles in the capital, and international friends, totaling more than 800 people.

Indian Ambassador to China, N. Raghavan, and embassy staff also attended the opening ceremony.

Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke first, extending a warm welcome and sincere thanks to the Indian Art Delegation for their visit and performance in China. He said: The Indian people, with their high degree of diligence and wisdom, have made many contributions in various aspects of culture and art. The Chinese people deeply wish to conduct extensive cultural exchanges with the Indian people on the basis of mutual respect for national cultures. We firmly believe that the visit and performance of the Indian Art Delegation will be warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and will greatly enhance the friendly unity between the Chinese and Indian people.

Sachin Sen Gupta, head of the Indian Art Delegation, delivered a speech, warmly praising China's rich ancient cultural heritage and the new Chinese art that constantly absorbs new content on the basis of ancient culture. He hoped that through this mutual observation, it would contribute to the progress of Indian art. He said: The Chinese people's appreciation, sympathy, and praise for Indian art are an encouragement to the Indian people.

After the delegation leader's speech, the delegation's artists began to perform music and dance programs.

The first program was the Indian patriotic song "Mother! We Salute You," sung by the famous Indian singers Krishnaji Ganesh Phulambrikar and Mrs. Shirabai Barodekar, among others. This song was composed at the end of the 19th century and is very popular throughout India. It has become the slogan of the patriotic people of India, and in the past, many Indian patriots sang it before their sacrifice. This song won lasting applause from the audience. Subsequently, the artists performed solo singing, dancing, instrumental performances, and monologues. These programs were all warmly welcomed by the audience. Some of the classical songs soloed by Phulambrikar were composed five or six hundred years ago. Mrs. Barodekar sang the classical "Marathi Tune," which used melodious singing to describe the happy mood of girls drawing water. Damayanti Joshi's performance of Kathak dance is a dance with high technique and graceful posture. The dancer wears three hundred small bells on her feet, and with the dance, produces very harmonious rhythms. The sitar (stringed instrument) played by the famous musician Vilayat Hussain Khan is a very outstanding performance. Chandralekha Patel, who won an award at the 3rd World Youth and Students Peace Festival in Berlin, performed the famous "Bharatanatyam Dance." Biralagom Devendrappa's performance on the Veena (stringed instrument) and Mahadev Narayan Indurkar's performance on the Tabla (percussion instrument) are both instruments with distinctive oriental features. Singer Debabrata Biswas recited poems by the great Indian poet Tagore. The last program was the Kathakali dance drama "The Death of Duryodhana," performed by the dance troupe of the famous old poet from South India, Vallathol Narayana Menon. This is a story known to every household in India, symbolizing the struggle between "good" and "evil," with "good" finally triumphing. This program received warm applause from the audience.

These performances allowed the audience to further recognize the achievements of Indian people in culture and art.

At the end of the performance, many young literary and art workers from the capital rushed onto the stage to present flowers to the Indian artists to thank them for their outstanding performances.

    这些表演，使观众进一步认识到印度人民文化艺术的成就。
    表演结束时，首都的青年文艺工作者多人涌上舞台向印度艺术家们献花，以感谢他们的卓越的演出。
