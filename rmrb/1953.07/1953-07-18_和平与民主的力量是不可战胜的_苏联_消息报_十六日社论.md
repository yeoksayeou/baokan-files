	The current international situation is characterized by: on the one hand, the further upsurge of the strength of the democratic camp and the liberation movements on a world scale, and on the other hand, the continued weakening of the imperialist camp and the increasing acuteness of the difficulties and internal contradictions of this camp.

	Our Soviet motherland is constantly achieving new successes in communist construction. The close unity between the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the people, and the indestructible friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union are guarantees for the further development of the creativity of the Soviet people and the continuous strengthening of the strength of the Soviet state.

	The enemy's attempts to weaken the Soviet Union and to divide and disintegrate our ranks have been shattered by reality time and again. The working people of the Soviet Union warmly endorse and actively support the policies of the Communist Party. The unanimous support of the entire Soviet people for the timely and resolute measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to liquidate the anti-Party and anti-state crimes of Beria, the despicable enemy of the people and agent of international imperialism, is a powerful proof of this.

	The Soviet Union's unwavering and consistent policy of peace is in line with the vital interests of the people of all countries. The recent peace initiatives of the Soviet government have further strengthened the Soviet Union's international position, further enhanced its prestige in the hearts of peace-loving people, and further promoted the upsurge of the world movement to defend peace. The Soviet government's statement that all international disputes and outstanding issues can be resolved through consultations between the countries concerned has been supported by all honest people around the world.

	The People's Republic of China and the people's democracies of Europe are advancing hand in hand with the Soviet Union. The great Chinese people and the people of Central and Southeast European countries have transformed the lives of their countries in a short period of time since being liberated from capitalist oppression, feudal landlords, and foreign imperialist regimes.

	The working people of the people's democracies of Europe are confidently advancing along the road of building socialism. While ensuring the resolution of the task of transforming the national economy, the people's democratic governments of these countries also pay great attention to improving the living standards of the working masses. The people's regimes in Eastern Europe are solid and strong because all their activities are for the benefit of the working people.

	The new China is growing stronger day by day, and its influence in the international arena is also strengthening. The economy and culture of the People's Republic of China are being greatly improved. The elections of people's congresses at all levels currently underway in China are a significant demonstration of the continuous development of democracy.

	The relationship of fraternal friendship and mutual assistance has been formed between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies of Europe. The socialist camp is constantly growing and prospering on the basis of strengthening this relationship, becoming the main force in the struggle for peace, democracy, and the happy future of all progressive humanity. Only those who have lost their sense of reality and do not understand the course of historical development would think that the people who have realized freedom would agree to reject freedom and agree to return to imperialist enslavement. No matter what insidious means the imperialists adopt, they cannot shake the unity of the working people of the people's democracies, who are united around the Communist and Workers' Parties. The friendship between the People's Republic of China, the people's democracies of Europe, and the Soviet Union, which is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, is solid and indestructible, and all the conspiracies of the enemies of peace, democracy, and socialism will be shattered by this friendship.

	The forces of world peace and democracy are being consolidated day by day. The working people of capitalist countries are increasingly resolutely opposed to the policy of arms expansion and the policies that lead to hunger, poverty, and unemployment, and are increasingly actively fighting for their rights and democratic freedoms, against capitalist exploitation and the attacks of reactionaries.

	In Western European countries, the sentiment of protesting against foreign interference in their affairs, against foreign military bases, military alliances, and "defense groups" that threaten the national independence and security of Western European countries is growing. Not long ago, the Italian elections, the political crisis in France, and the movement, including the broadest social strata, against the ratification of the "European Army" treaty, were only some of the many facts that illustrate the opposition of the people of Western European countries to the policy of sacrificing the interests of their countries for the adventurous plans of the cold war and hot war strategists from across the ocean.

	The national liberation struggle in colonies and dependent countries is expanding day by day. In the dependent countries of Asia, in the Near East, the Middle East, on the African continent, and in the countries of Latin America, the movement for national independence is generally strengthening.

	All this illustrates the further aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism and the weakening of the entire capitalist system. Due to the United States imperialism's frenzied expansion and its bossy commands to its little sidekicks and dependent countries, the contradictions within the capitalist camp are becoming more and more intense. International events provide many proofs that the bankruptcy of the United States' notorious "policy of strength" is encountering increasingly strong resistance from the masses of the people. Now, American newspapers have had to admit the decline of the United States' prestige in the capitalist world and the increasing isolation of the United States' aggressive bloc.

	On the one hand, the continuous strengthening of the forces of democracy and socialism, and on the other hand, the general weakening of the imperialist camp, this situation has caused panic among the imperialists. They are trying their best to intensify their hostile activities against the cause of peace and democracy in order to find a way out. The aggressive bloc of the main imperialist country, the United States, is taking the most extreme measures to obstruct the relaxation of international tensions. The world reactionary forces are madly trying to destroy the international peace and democracy camp, especially the growing strength of the leading force of this camp, the Soviet Union.

	It is now completely clear that the provocative incidents that occurred in Berlin in June and the provocative actions of Syngman Rhee in Korea were not accidental, but part of a broad plan formulated by Washington, the headquarters of the Atlantic Group, and the headquarters of the imperialist intelligence agencies. The purpose of this plan is to intimidate international public opinion that advocates peace. This plan is to convince the Western European partners of the United States that it seems that conducting adventures and provocations in international life is more effective than negotiation.

	The imperialist reactionaries have spent particularly great efforts in carrying out subversive activities in the countries of the democratic camp, allocating hundreds of millions of dollars, either openly or secretly, for this purpose. The imperialists are looking for traitors and corrupt elements in the democratic and socialist countries as their pillars and are intensifying the sabotage activities of their spy agencies.

	The adventurous actions taken by imperialism in recent weeks have been defeated. This has been warmly supported by all peace-loving people. The American-instigated fascist adventure in Berlin has failed. The true commanders of the American puppet Syngman Rhee have been exposed. People know whose fault it is that the Korean armistice agreement has not yet been signed.

	The liquidation of Beria's criminal adventurous actions should also be regarded as a major defeat for imperialism. The exposure of this despicable traitor has once again proved that any anti-Soviet conspiracy of imperialism is powerless in the face of the indestructible strength of the socialist countries, in the face of the great unity of our Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the people.

	All other adventures and subversive activities of imperialism will inevitably suffer bankruptcy, because the democratic and socialist camp is united, its strength is infinite; because millions of people around the world are constantly participating in the struggle for peace and against the instigators of war.

    和平与民主的力量是不可战胜的
    ——苏联“消息报”十六日社论
    目前国际局势的特点是：一方面，民主阵营和世界规模的解放运动的力量的进一步高涨，另一方面，帝国主义阵营的继续削弱，以及这个阵营的困难和内部矛盾的日益尖锐。
    我们苏维埃祖国在共产主义建设中不断获得新的成就。共产党、苏联政府和人民之间的紧密的团结一致，苏联各民族的不可摧毁的友谊是苏联人创造力进一步发展的保证，是苏维埃国家的实力不断加强的保证。
    敌人指望削弱苏联、指望分裂和涣散我们队伍，这种打算被现实生活一次又一次地粉碎了。苏联的劳动人民热烈地拥护和积极地支持共产党的政策。全体苏联人民一致拥护苏联共产党中央委员会为清算人民的可恶的敌人、国际帝国主义代理人贝利亚的反党、反国家的罪行而采取的及时和坚决的措施，就非常有力地证明了这一点。
    苏联的不可动摇的和始终一贯的和平政策是符合世界各国人民的切身利益的。苏联政府最近的和平倡议使苏联的国际地位进一步加强，在爱好和平的人民的心目中更加提高了苏联的威望，使世界保卫和平运动有了更进一步的高涨。苏联政府关于一切国际纠纷和悬案是可以用各有关国家进行协商的方法解决的声明，已获得全世界一切正直的人士的支持。
    中华人民共和国、欧洲各人民民主国家和苏联手挽手地前进。伟大的中国人民、中欧和东南欧各国人民自从由资本主义压迫、封建地主和外国帝国主义政权下解放出来以后，在短期内就改造了自己国家的生活。
    欧洲各人民民主国家的劳动人民充满信心地沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。这些国家的人民民主政权一方面保证解决改造国民经济的任务，同时也极其关注劳动群众生活水平的提高。东欧各国的人民政权是牢靠坚固的，因为它们的一切活动都是为着劳动人民的福利。
    新中国在一天天地壮大，它在国际上的影响也在加强。中华人民共和国的经济和文化都在大力提高。现在正在中国进行的各级人民代表大会的选举，就显著地证明民主的不断的发展。
    在苏联、中华人民共和国和欧洲各人民民主国家之间形成了兄弟友谊和互助的关系，社会主义阵营就在加强这种关系的基础上不断地成长和繁荣，成为在争取和平、民主和全体进步人类幸福将来的斗争中的主要力量。只有那些丧失了现实感觉和不懂得历史发展过程的人才会这样想：已经认识到自由的人民会同意拒绝接受自由，会同意回复到帝国主义的奴役中去。无论帝国主义者采用怎样奸险的手段，都不能动摇团结在共产党和工人党周围的各人民民主国家的劳动人民的团结一致。建立在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的中华人民共和国、欧洲各人民民主国家和苏联之间的友谊，是坚固和不
    可摧毁的，和平、民主和社会主义的敌人的一切阴谋，都将被这种友谊碰得粉碎。
    世界和平与民主的力量日益巩固。资本主义国家的劳动人民越来越坚决地反对扩军政策和导致饥饿、贫困、失业的政策，越来越积极地争取自己的权利和民主自由，反对资本主义的剥削和反动派的进攻。
    在西欧各国，抗议外国干涉它们的事务，抗议威胁西欧各国的民族独立和安全的外国军事基地、军事同盟和“防御集团”的情绪日益高涨。不久以前，意大利的选举、法国的政治危机、包括最广泛的社会阶层的反对批准“欧洲军”条约的运动等，不过只是许多事实的一部分，这些事实说明了西欧各国人民反对那种使他们国家的利益去为大洋彼岸的冷战和热战的战略家的冒险计划去牺牲的政策。
    殖民地和附属国的民族解放斗争日益扩展。在亚洲各附属国中，在近东、中东，在非洲大陆上，在拉丁美洲的国家中，争取民族独立的运动正在普遍加强。
    这一切都说明资本主义总危机的进一步尖锐化和整个资本主义体系的削弱。由于美国帝国主义疯狂的扩张，由于它对它的小伙计、附属国蛮横地发号施令，资本主义阵营内部的矛盾越来越剧烈。国际事件提供着许多证明，证明美国的臭名远扬的“实力政策”的破产，它遭到人民大众愈来愈强烈的抵抗。现在，美国报纸已不得不承认美国在资本主义世界中威信下降，美国侵略集团的日益孤立。
    一方面是民主、社会主义力量的不断加强，一方面帝国主义阵营的普遍削弱，这种情形引起帝国主义者的恐慌。他们竭力加紧进行对和平、民主事业的敌对活动，以寻找出路。主要的帝国主义国家美国的侵略集团，采取最极端的手段来阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。世界反动势力疯狂地想摧毁国际和平、民主阵营、首先是这个阵营的领导力量苏联的不断壮大的力量。
    现在已经完全清楚：六月间柏林所发生的挑衅事件，朝鲜李承晚的挑衅行为并不是偶然的，而是华盛顿、大西洋集团的司令部和帝国主义情报机关的司令部所制订的广泛的计划中的一部分。这种计划的目的是要恐吓主张和平的国际舆论。这种计划是为了使美国的西欧伙伴们相信：似乎在国际生活中进行冒险和挑衅的方式比谈判的方式更为有效。
    帝国主义反动派费了特别大的力量在民主阵营各国中进行颠覆活动，为此目的或明或暗地拨出数以亿计的美元。帝国主义者在民主和社会主义国家中寻找叛徒和腐化分子作为自己的支柱，加紧他们的间谍机关的破坏活动。
    最近几星期来帝国主义所采取的冒险行动遭到了失败。这受到了所有爱好和平人民的热烈拥护。美国主使的柏林法西斯冒险行动失败了。美国傀儡李承晚的真正指挥者被揭露出来了。人们知道了朝鲜停战协定的至今不能签订，是谁的罪过。
    贝利亚的罪恶的冒险行动的被清算，也应当被认为是帝国主义的巨大失败。这个卑鄙的叛徒的被揭发又一次地证明了，帝国主义的任何反苏阴谋，在社会主义国家不可摧毁的力量面前，在我们共产党、苏联政府和人民的伟大的团结面前，是无能为力的。
    帝国主义的其他一切冒险和颠覆活动同样要遭到不可避免的破产，因为民主和社会主义阵营是团结一致的，它的力量是无穷无尽的；因为世界各地不断有数以百万计的人民参加争取和平、反对战争挑拨者的斗争。    （新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯）
