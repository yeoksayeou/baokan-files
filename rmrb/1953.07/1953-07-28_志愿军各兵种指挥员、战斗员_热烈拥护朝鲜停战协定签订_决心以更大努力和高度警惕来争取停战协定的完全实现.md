Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 27th: The commanders and fighters of all arms of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warmly support the Korean Armistice Agreement signed at Panmunjom this morning at 10:00 AM, and expressed their firm determination to abide by it.

A certain division on the Kimcheng front established merits in the battle to crush the enemy's "Autumn Offensive" south of Kimcheng in 1951, in the counterattack on both sides of the Bukhan River this year, and most recently in the powerful counterattack against the Syngman Rhee puppet army south of Kimcheng. In the past three years, they have eliminated more than 25,000 enemy troops. The division commander said, "We must not forget that peace is achieved through struggle. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the result of the heavy blows dealt to the enemy by the Korean and Chinese people, and it is also the result of the struggle of the world's peace and democratic forces, led by the Soviet Union, for the cause of peace. However, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the plots of some warmongers in the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique to continue to undermine peace, and strive more firmly for the full realization of the Korean Armistice Agreement and for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."

The "Liu Dongwu Heroic Platoon" of a certain unit eliminated 550 enemies in the operation to crush the enemy's "Autumn Offensive" in 1951. Wang Bingjun, the deputy platoon leader of the platoon, said, "The realization of the Korean armistice is inseparable from the arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice of our countless comrades. Our Yang Gensi-style heroic platoon leader, Liu Dongwu, sacrificed his life to defend the motherland and defend peace. We will resolutely implement all the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and we must strive to consolidate the peace achieved through struggle. Whoever dares to undermine the Korean armistice, we will resolutely strike at them as before!"

Ma Xinnian, a special-class meritorious person who won the title of Second-Class Hero in the glorious Battle of Shangganling, said: "We resolutely support the Korean Armistice Agreement. In order to defend peace and defend the motherland, I fought bravely in the Battle of Shangganling. In the future, we must fight more firmly for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."

Zheng Changhua, the commander of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force and a Second-Class Hero, said: "The Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, but the task before us is still very arduous. We must strive for the complete realization of the Korean Armistice Agreement and strive for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."

The logistics units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which have made great contributions to the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, also warmly support the Korean Armistice Agreement. The commanders and fighters of the "Yang Liandi Company," which has established brilliant achievements on the railway front, said: In the future, we will continue to carry forward the spirit of heroic and tenacious struggle and help the Korean people restore their railway industry. Zhang Zhaoyi, a special-class meritorious person and a car driver with 57,000 kilometers of safe driving, said: "We must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold and constantly prevent the US warmongers and the Syngman Rhee clique from undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement!"
