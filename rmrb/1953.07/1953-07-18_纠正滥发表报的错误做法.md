Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Under the title "Improve Leadership Methods and Overcome the 'Five Excesses' Phenomenon," the "Reader's Letter Excerpts" column published on June 1st several letters from readers exposing the "Five Excesses" phenomenon, including criticisms of the Hebei Province Pingquan County's disguised indiscriminate issuance of reports and the Shijiazhuang Prefecture's Marriage Law Implementation Office's indiscriminate issuance of complex and unfillable forms during the Marriage Law implementation campaign. The following are excerpts from the replies of the aforementioned two units:

    Letter from Pingquan County People's Government: Readers' criticism of our disguised indiscriminate issuance of forms is pertinent and correct. After our inspection, the reason for this error is due to our insufficient understanding of the importance of overcoming the "Five Excesses" phenomenon. We usually do not systematically accumulate and organize the figures for the work of various districts, and we ask for them from below when needed. After the practice of indiscriminately issuing reports was criticized, we replaced it with issuing long outlines, asking the lower levels to report, or preparing forms but not issuing them downwards, forcing district cadres attending meetings in the county to fill them out. All districts knew about this "old problem" of the county, and cadres brought a package of materials when they came to meetings, using whatever was needed, and "estimating" what they didn't have. The figures we wanted were actually not very useful; however, the trouble caused to lower-level cadres by asking for these figures was great. We accept readers' criticism and are determined to correct this error. In the future, in addition to strengthening the management and inspection of report work by the statistics department, the statistics department and the secretary department will also cooperate to accumulate and organize materials from below, and reports that should not be issued downwards will never be issued indiscriminately or disguised, so that lower-level cadres can concentrate their energy and better lead agricultural production work.

    Letter from Shijiazhuang Prefecture Marriage Law Implementation Office: The Hebei Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department Inspection Team exposed the "bureaucratic investigation form" we issued during the Marriage Law implementation campaign. We have conducted an inspection of this. In the early stage of the Marriage Law implementation campaign, we attempted to grasp the changes in marriage through this campaign, and several comrades in the office subjectively drafted such a form. Our prefecture has mountains and plains, and the situations are very different, but we did not consider this at all when making the form. Because of blindly pursuing "details" and disregarding the difficulties of the lower levels, the complexity and cumbersomeness of this form were indeed alarming. After the form was drafted, we did not conduct careful research and submit it to the leadership for review, and we irresponsibly issued it. Now it can be seen that this form is not only impossible to fill out, increasing the working difficulties of lower-level organs; but it will also make the masses worry about the Marriage Law implementation campaign. After the form was issued, some comrades in the office also felt it was inappropriate, but we did not seriously remedy it; even when some counties raised objections, we still said, "It's better to investigate." It was not until we inspected the work later that we felt that asking the counties to fill out this form was just a waste of manpower and money, and its effect was very small, that we affirmed that the counties should no longer fill it out.

    We are determined to accept this lesson and correct this subjectivist and decentralist error in the future.

### 纠正滥发表报的错误做法

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    纠正滥发表报的错误做法
    “读者来信摘要”栏在六月一日以“改进领导方法克服‘五多’现象”为题发表了几封读者揭发“五多”现象的来信，其中批评了热河省平泉县变相滥发表报和石家庄专区贯彻婚姻法办公室在贯彻婚姻法运动中滥发繁复得使人无法填写的表格的做法。现将上述两单位的答复摘要发表于后：
    平泉县人民政府来信：读者对我们变相滥发表格的批评是中肯而正确的。经我们检查，造成这种错误的原因是由于我们对克服“五多”现象的重要性认识不足。我们平日对有关各区工作的数字不作有系统的积累整理工作，需要时就向下面要。在滥发表报的做法受到批判以后，我们就用发长的提纲，要下面汇报的办法来代替，或者准备好表格但不往下发而逼着到县开会的区干部填写。各区都知道县里这个“老毛病”，干部来开会时都带着一包子材料，要啥用啥，没有的就“估”着填。我们所要的这些数字，实际上用处不大；但因要这些数字而给下级干部增加的麻烦却很大。我们接受读者批评，决心纠正这种错误。今后除加强统计部门对表报工作的管理和检查外，并由统计部门和秘书部门协同积累、整理来自下面的材料，不应往下发的表报决不往下滥发或变相往下发，使下级干部能集中精力，更好地领导农业生产工作。
    石家庄专区贯彻婚姻法办公室来信：中共河北省委宣传部检查组揭发我们在贯彻婚姻法运动中所发的“一张官僚主义的调查表”。我们对此已作了检查。在贯彻婚姻法运动初期，我们企图通过这次运动掌握婚姻变化情况，办公室的几个同志就凭主观拟出了这样一张表。我们专区有山地、有平原，情况很不同，但我们制表时却毫不加以考虑。因为盲目追求“详细”和不顾下边困难，这张表格的繁琐、复杂的确到了惊人的程度。表格拟好后，我们没有再经认真研究和呈请领导审查，就不负责任地发了出去。现在可以看出，这张表格不但无法填写，增加了下级机关的工作困难；并且也会使群众产生对贯彻婚姻法运动的顾虑。在表格发出后，办公室有的同志也感到不妥，但我们却没有认真补救；甚至在有些县提出意见时，我们仍说“还是调查一下好”。直到后来我们检查工作时，感到要各县填这张表格只是劳民伤财，作用很小，才肯定让各县不要再填了。
    我们决心接受这个教训，今后要纠正这种主观主义和分散主义的错误。
