    Strive for the Full Implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Pei Wen
    The Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, and the Korean peace that the people of the world have unanimously longed for has taken a step forward. A brief review of the tremendous changes in the Korean War situation over the past three years and the countless difficulties and twists and turns experienced in the Korean armistice negotiations over the past two years will immediately make people feel that this achievement is a great victory for the people of China and Korea and the peace-loving people of the world in their struggle for peace, and especially a great contribution made by the people of China and Korea to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world. The purpose of the just war of resistance against aggression that the people of China and Korea were forced to wage was to strive for conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The joint declaration of the democratic parties in our country on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea issued on November 4, 1950, clearly stated: "The Chinese people ardently love peace. We have always wanted peace in the past, and we will always want peace in the future. We want peace for China, we want peace for Asia, and we want lasting peace for the whole world and all mankind."
    What do the three years of the Korean anti-aggression war and the two years of the Korean armistice negotiations tell us?
    First, it tells us that in Asia after the end of World War II, and in Asia after the complete victory of the Chinese revolution, the era of imperialist tyranny is gone with history. Today, any imperialism, including powerful imperialism like the United States, is doomed to failure if it attempts to conquer and enslave other nations by force. We should all remember how arrogant and rampant the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique and the U.S. warmongers were when they colluded to launch the Korean War; and how invincible the U.S. military was when it landed in Incheon, crossed the 38th parallel, and attacked the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on the northeastern border of our country. However, at this moment, the Chinese People's Volunteers were forced to participate in the anti-aggression war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in order to defend their homes and the country, and began to fight the invading enemy side by side with the Korean People's Army. In the first battle of Yunshan and Wenjing, and the second battle of Xinxingdong and Changjin Lake, they successively smashed the enemy's two crazy offensives that clamored "going home before Thanksgiving" and "going home before Christmas," and drove the enemy back to the 38th parallel where they launched the war, changing the situation of the Korean War. Later, the Chinese and Korean People's forces successively crushed the enemy's northward advance. This made the enemy have to admit that this war was a war in which "the United Nations sees no hope of victory" and "the most costly and bloody war the United States has ever fought." As a result, the United States had to accept the Soviet proposal and began armistice negotiations in July 1951. However, due to the U.S. procrastination and sabotage of the armistice negotiations, the Korean War continued to undergo changes that were unfavorable to the United States. The initiative on the Korean battlefield was completely in the hands of our army. Our army was able to defend and attack; the enemy could neither attack nor defend. Our casualties decreased day by day, and the enemy's casualties increased greatly. The counterattack launched by our army in the central Korean front against the Syngman Rhee puppet army, which was constantly provoking, in the middle of this month is proof of our army's unprecedentedly powerful might. In just a few days, this counterattack defeated four divisions of the enemy, occupied more than 190 square kilometers of area, and annihilated more than 26,000 enemies. In the recent month and a half, the Chinese and Korean People's Army annihilated more than 110,000 enemies. The southward shift of the front line has become an inevitable phenomenon with the prolongation of the war. From June to recently, the military demarcation line of the Korean armistice has been revised twice, once pushed southward by 150 square kilometers, and recently pushed southward by another 192 square kilometers. The Korean War was becoming more and more unfavorable for the United States. This is an important condition for the armistice in Korea to reach an agreement.
    Secondly, the success of the Korean armistice negotiations also tells us that adhering to the method of consultation can resolve any international disputes. The Korean War is one of the most serious and acute international disputes. The Korean armistice negotiations for more than two years were conducted in a tortuous, difficult, and arduous situation. However, no matter how arrogant and unreasonable the U.S. side was, and how arbitrarily it delayed and sabotaged, our side always adhered to the spirit of consultation and made persistent efforts, and finally made all the armistice negotiations reach an agreement, laying the foundation for a complete and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and also providing an example for resolving other international disputes through consultation.
    The victory of the war and the success of the consultation are two very important conditions for the Korean issue to further achieve a peaceful resolution, and neither is dispensable. This will encourage the courage of the people of the world to fight against aggression and the confidence in resolving international disputes through consultation. Facts have proved that as long as the people of the world take on the cause of defending peace, the aggression of the aggressors can certainly be stopped, international disputes can certainly be resolved in a spirit of consultation, and peace will certainly prevail.
    The armistice agreement has now been signed. However, it would be completely wrong to think that there will be no more problems with the realization of the armistice, or that we can be unguarded and relax our vigilance. Let's look at the remarks of the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique on the eve of the armistice! According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on July 24, Syngman Rhee said: "Certain guarantees made by the United Nations forces to the Communists 'must not be allowed to be realized'." The Syngman Rhee group has been deliberately trying to obstruct and undermine the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Syngman Rhee, the U.S. running dog who has been raised by the United States and then dragged back to Korea, cannot exist in South Korea without the support of the United States. Even South Korean puppet Prime Minister Baek Du-jin cannot deny this. In his statement on July 23 requesting U.S. support, he said: If the United States does not immediately provide economic assistance to South Korea, "South Korea will collapse." So why does Syngman Rhee dare to clamor to undermine the Korean armistice? Because there are still warmongers in the United States who are encouraging and supporting him. As the Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said in its editorial on July 25: "It is no longer a secret that officials in the Eisenhower administration are secretly doing their best to encourage Syngman Rhee to carry out his sabotage activities. Influential Republicans such as Senators McCarthy and Taft are engaged in activities to break the armistice talks." Obviously, these "influential Republicans" will not be willing to give up their conspiracy to encourage Syngman Rhee to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement even after the armistice agreement is signed. Dulles, who helped Syngman Rhee plan the adventurous war in Korea three years ago, is today openly and painstakingly encouraging and supporting Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to obstruct and undermine the Korean armistice. On the 21st of this month, three days after General Nam Il, the chief representative of our side in the Korean armistice negotiations, announced General Harrison, the chief representative of the U.S. side, made a clear guarantee for the implementation of the armistice, Dulles said that if "South Korea is re-invaded," "the United States will retaliate against this action"; the next day, the 22nd, Syngman Rhee said that he was not bound by the armistice agreement; on the same day, Dulles issued a statement saying that Syngman Rhee "has always maintained his government's position" and "he has the right to do so." So, after a day, on the 24th, Syngman Rhee became bolder and hinted that he would "take unilateral policies" again. On the 25th, the United Press said that Dulles had given Syngman Rhee another letter. Although the content of the letter was not made public, it can be concluded that the content of the letter was nothing else but, as Dulles said in his statement on the 22nd, "The U.S. government has done its best to meet his requirements" for the guarantees requested by Syngman Rhee. What is the guarantee requested by Syngman Rhee? This is: The United States guarantees to him: If the United States cannot achieve his goal of "unifying Korea" within ninety days, then he will "resume the war" and the United States will fight with him again. If this cannot be done, the United States, in addition to providing economic assistance, will also provide support "spiritually and materially." Both the former and the latter are extremely contradictory to Harrison's reply to our side's guarantee regarding the implementation of the armistice. The New York "Daily Worker" was completely correct in its editorial on the 21st of this month: "The American people had better be vigilant, because unfortunately, as long as there are Dulles and McCarthy in Washington and Syngman Rhee in Seoul, the possibility of provocative acts will always exist." Therefore, we must never become paralyzed because of the signing of the armistice agreement and must continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance.
    On the one hand, we must resolutely abide by and fulfill all the terms of the armistice agreement, and at the same time, we must never reduce our vigilance against the enemy's conspiracy to sabotage activities. If the U.S. warmongers and the Syngman Rhee group dare to risk the world's disapproval and sabotage the implementation of the armistice agreement, the Chinese and Korean People's Army must, in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement and the two guarantees of the U.S. side, take the necessary anti-aggression and self-defense actions to ensure that the armistice is not sabotaged. Therefore, the current task of the people of China and Korea is to strive for the complete realization of the Korean armistice so as to facilitate the convening of a higher-level political conference to further discuss and resolve the entire Korean issue.

    为朝鲜停战协定的全部实施而努力
    沛文
    朝鲜停战协定已经签字了，全世界人民一致渴望的朝鲜和平已经向前迈进了一步。只要稍稍回忆一下三年多来朝鲜战争形势的巨大变化和两年多来朝鲜停战谈判经历的无数困难和曲折，人们就会立刻感到这一成就是朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民争取和平的伟大胜利，特别是朝中人民对远东和世界和平事业所作的伟大贡献。朝中人民被迫进行这次反侵略的正义战争的目的，就是为了争取条件以便和平解决朝鲜问题。一九五○年十一月四日我国各民主党派发表的抗美援朝联合宣言中说得很清楚：“中国人民是酷爱和平的。我们以前一向要和平，我们今后永远要和平。我们要中国的和平，我们要亚洲的和平，我们要全世界全人类的持久和平。”
    三年来的朝鲜反侵略战争和两年来的朝鲜停战谈判告诉我们什么呢？
    首先告诉我们：在第二次世界大战结束以后的亚洲，在中国革命获得全面胜利以后的亚洲，帝国主义横行霸道的时代已经随着历史一去不复返了。今天，任何一个帝国主义，包括像美国这样强大的帝国主义，要是企图凭借武力来征服和奴役其他民族，那是注定要失败的。我们总该记得在李承晚反动集团和美国好战分子勾结起来发动朝鲜战争的时候，他们曾经是如何的狂妄和嚣张；以后美军在仁川登陆越过三八线向我国东北边境的鸭绿江和图们江进攻的时候，他们又曾经是如何的不可一世。可是，就在这时，中国人民志愿军为了保家卫国被迫参加了抗美援朝的反侵略战争，开始与朝鲜人民军并肩打击进犯的敌人。一战云山、温井，再战新兴洞和长津湖，接连粉碎了敌人狂妄叫嚣的“感恩节前回家”“圣诞节前回家”的两次疯狂攻势，一直把敌人赶到他们发动战争的三八线上，朝鲜战争形势改观了。以后，朝中人民部队又连续粉碎了敌人的向北进犯。使得敌人不得不承认这场战争是“看不到联合国有胜利的希望”的战争，“是美国进行的代价最大、流血最多的战争”。这样，美国才不得不接受苏联的建议于一九五一年七月开始停战谈判。但是，由于美国对停战谈判的拖延和破坏，朝鲜战争继续发生着不利于美国的变化。朝鲜战场上的主动权完全掌握在我军手中。我军是守得住，攻得下；敌人则既攻不下，也守不住。我军的伤亡日益减少，敌人的伤亡大大增加。本月中旬我军在朝鲜中线对不断寻衅的李承晚伪军展开的反击战就是我军威力空前强大的证明。这次反击战仅仅几天的时间，就击溃了敌人四个师的部队，占领了一百九十多平方公里的地区，歼灭了两万六千多名的敌人。最近一个半月多一点的时间，朝中人民军队就歼灭了十一万以上的敌人。战线日益南移，也就成了随着战争延长的必然现象。从六月到最近，朝鲜停战的军事分界线就做了两次修改，一次向南推移了一百五十平方公里，最近一次又向南推移了一百九十二多平方公里。朝鲜战争是对美国越来越不妙了。这是朝鲜停战所以能够达成协议的重要条件。
    其次朝鲜停战谈判的成功还告诉我们，坚持采用协商方式是可以解决任何国际争端的。朝鲜战争是最严重和最尖锐的国际争端之一。两年多的朝鲜停战谈判就是在迂回曲折困难重重的情况下进行的。但是，不管美方多么蛮横无理，肆意拖延破坏，我方始终坚持协商精神，作了坚韧的努力，终于使得停战谈判全部获得协议，为朝鲜问题的彻底和平解决打下了基础，也为用协商方式解决其他国际争端提供了范例。
    战争的胜利和协商的成功，是朝鲜问题能够进一步获得和平解决的两个非常重要的条件，缺一不可。这将鼓舞全世界人民进行反侵略斗争的勇气和用协商方式解决国际争端的信心。事实证明，只要全世界人民把保卫和平的事业担当起来，侵略分子的侵略行动一定能够被制止，国际争端一定能够用协商精神得到解决，和平也一定能胜利。
    停战协定现在签订了。但是，如果以为停战的实现已经不会再有任何问题，如果以为我们可以不加警惕，放松戒备的话，那就完全错了。我们且看就在停战前夕李承晚反动集团的言论吧！据美联社华盛顿七月二十四日电讯透露李承晚说：“联合国军方面向共方所作的某些保证‘绝不能允许实现’。”李承晚集团一直在处心积虑地要阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战协定的实施。李承晚，这个一直被美国豢养以后被牵回朝鲜来的美国走狗，要是没有美国的支持，是无法在南朝鲜存在的。这一点，连南朝鲜伪总理白斗镇也不能否认，他在七月二十三日要求美国支持的声明中说：美国要是不立即给南朝鲜经济援助“韩国就要垮台”。那么李承晚为什么敢于大叫大嚷要破坏朝鲜停战呢？因为在美国还有鼓励着和支持着他的好战分子，这些好战分子正像七月二十五日印度“甘露市场报”的社论中所说的：“艾森豪威尔政府中的僚属正在暗地尽力鼓励李承晚进行其破坏活动，这已不再是秘密了。有势力的共和党人如参议员麦卡锡和塔夫脱，正从事活动要使停战谈判破裂。”显然，这些“有势力的共和党人”在停战协定签定以后，也不会甘心放弃他们鼓励李承晚破坏停战条款实现的阴谋的。三年以前帮助李承晚策划了朝鲜的冒险战争的杜勒斯今天又正在明目张胆地、千方百计地鼓励着和支持着李承晚阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋活动。本月二十一日，当朝鲜停战谈判的我方首席代表南日大将公布了美方首席代表哈利逊将军对实施停战的明确保证的第三天，杜勒斯说，如果“南朝鲜重新受到侵略”，“美国将对这种行动予以还击”；过了一天，即二十二日，李承晚就说，他不受停战协定的约束了；同一天，杜勒斯发表了一个声明说，李承晚“一直保留着他的政府的主张”，“他有权利这样做”，于是，隔了一天，二十四日，李承晚的胆子更大起来，他暗示又要“采取片面政策”了。二十五日，合众社说，杜勒斯又给了李承晚一封信，信的内容虽然没有公布，但根据李承晚看了之后“非常高兴”这一点也就可以断定这封信的内容不是别的，而是像杜勒斯二十二日声明中所说的，对于李承晚“要求的保证，美国政府已尽量满足他的要求”。李承晚要求的保证是什么呢？这就是：美国向他保证：如果美国在九十天之内不能使他达到“统一朝鲜”的目的，那么他就要“恢复战争”，美国就和他一起重新作战。如果这一点作不到，美国除了给予经济援助以外，还要在“精神上和物质上”予以支持。而不管是前者和后者，都是和哈利逊答复我方关于实施停战的保证极端矛盾的。纽约“工人日报”在本月二十一日的社论中指出的是完全正确的：“美国人民最好是保持警惕，因为不幸得很，只要在华盛顿有杜勒斯和麦卡锡，在汉城有李承晚，那么发生挑衅行为的可能性就始终存在着的。”因此，我们绝对不能因为停战协定的签字而发生麻痹，必须继续保持高度警惕。
    我们一方面要坚决遵守和履行停战协定的全部条款，同时绝不减低对敌人阴谋破坏活动的警惕，美国好战分子和李承晚集团如果胆敢冒天下之大不韪，竟然破坏停战协定的实现，朝中人民部队就一定要根据停战协定的规定和美方的两次保证，采取必要的反侵略自卫行动，以保障停战不受破坏。所以，朝中人民当前的任务就是努力争取朝鲜停战的彻底实现，以便于召开高一级的政治会议，进一步协商解决整个朝鲜问题。
