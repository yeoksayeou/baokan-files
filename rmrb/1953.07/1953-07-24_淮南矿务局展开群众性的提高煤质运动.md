Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 23rd: Since the Huainan Mining Bureau fully launched a mass campaign to improve coal quality in May, the quality of coal has improved. In May and June, the entire mining bureau completed 100.5 percent of the state plan's coal quality indicators. Among them, the Caijiagang Coal Mine completed 130.8 percent of the plan in June, and the ash content of the coal has been reduced from 18.25 percent to 10.38 percent.

The low quality of coal at the Huainan Mining Bureau has always been a serious problem. The Jiulonggang Coal Mine had a large backlog of coal that could not be sold due to its poor quality. Shanghai users even took pictures of a large amount of gangue and sent them to the Huainan Mining Bureau to criticize them. The problem of poor coal quality has aroused great attention from the leaders of Huainan Mining and all its employees. They conducted self-criticism and launched a mass movement to inspect and improve coal quality throughout the mining bureau. On the coal mining faces, transportation roads, wellheads, and tippler areas, people were everywhere picking out gangue; even very small stones were picked out by the workers to prevent them from being mixed into the coal. Workers at the Datong Coal Mine picked out 75 tons of gangue in the second quarter. After labor model Fu Suting found the trick of "separating coal and stone during mining," most of the gangue was eliminated underground. In order to consolidate and continue to improve coal quality, the Huainan Mining Bureau convened a coal preparation and testing meeting, and decided to resolutely implement the "Coal Preparation Regulations" and strengthen testing work. The workers of each coal mine also discussed and formulated "Quality Responsibility System," "Product Inspection System," and "Quality Reward System" to continue to improve coal quality. After the "Product Inspection System" was implemented, each coal mine checked the ash content of coal every shift every day and made reports to the mining bureau every other day, providing reliable data for improving coal quality in a timely manner. In order to more accurately grasp coal quality standards, the mining bureau recently added a batch of coal preparation and testing instruments.

    淮南矿务局展开群众性的提高煤质运动
    【新华社合肥二十三日电】淮南矿务局自五月份全面展开群众性的提高煤质的运动以后，煤的质量已有提高。五、六两月份全矿务局完成了国家计划的煤质指标百分之一百点五，其中蔡家岗煤矿六月份完成计划百分之一百三十点八，煤的灰份已由百分之十八点二五降低到百分之十点三八。
    淮南矿务局煤质低劣现象是一向存在的严重问题。九龙岗煤矿曾因煤质低劣，就积压了大批的煤卖不出去。上海用户曾把大批矸石拍成照片，转到淮南矿务局提出批评。煤质低劣问题，引起了淮南矿务领导方面和全体职工的极大重视，他们进行了自我批评，并在全矿务局展开了一个检查和提高煤质的群众性运动。在采煤工作面上、运输道上、井口上以及翻车平车的地方，到处都有人在检矸石；就是很小的石块，工人也把它检出来不让混到煤里去。大通煤矿的工人在第二季度里检出了七十五吨矸石；劳动模范傅宿亭找到了“煤石分采”的窍门后，绝大部分的矸石都在井下消灭了。为了巩固并继续提高煤质，淮南矿务局召开了选煤化验会议，决定坚决贯彻“选煤规程”加强化验工作。各煤矿工人并讨论订出了“质量责任制”、“产品检查制”、“质量奖励制”来继续提高煤质。“产品检查制”实行后，各煤矿每天每班都在检查煤的灰份，并做好报表隔日上报矿务局，及时提供改进煤质的可靠资料。为了更精确地掌握煤质标准，最近矿务局并添置了一批选煤和化验的仪器。
