First Ministry of Machine Building Specifically Arranges Central Work for the Second Half of the Year
Determines to Strengthen Planning Management with Operation Plans as the Center

The First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government convened a ministerial meeting from July 2nd to 10th to report on and study the production and capital construction situations in various regions, and in response to these situations, made specific arrangements for the central work in the second half of the year.

Although the total output value of the First Ministry of Machine Building in the first half of the year completed the state plan, 13 of the 28 major products did not complete the plan. The balance of production was very poor, and factories still had varying degrees of confusion in production management. At the end of March, the ministry convened a meeting of factory directors, which arranged for factories to carry out production management reform with strengthening planning management as the central task. Over the past few months, a few factories have made some achievements in strengthening planning management, but some factories do not know where to start; some factories have done some work, such as rectifying original records and strengthening quota management, but their thinking has not clearly recognized that the operation plan should be the central link of planning management, and therefore they have not truly overcome the chaotic rush production phenomenon.

After analyzing and studying the situation of various factories, the ministerial meeting determined that in the second half of the year, the focus of production should be on strengthening the planning management of enterprises with the preparation and implementation of operation plans as the center, striving to comprehensively and balancedly complete and overfulfill the state plan.

Due to the complexity and uneven development of the machine building industry, the meeting believed that the ministry's existing enterprises could be roughly divided into three types according to different production forms: the first type is single product, mass production; the second type is single product type but complex specifications, mass or small batch production; the third type is complex products, small batch or single piece production. These three different types of factories should have different specific methods in preparing operation plans. The meeting designated three professional bureaus to be responsible for convening small-scale meetings for research.

On the other hand, the meeting also analyzed that various factories can also be divided into three categories according to the different progress of production reform: the first category is that not much production reform work has been done, and there is still a lack of basic conditions for preparing operation plans; the second category is that some production reform work has been carried out, and the conditions for preparing operation plans, such as original records and various basic quotas, have already been available, but are not complete; the third category is that production management work has been done more, operation plans have been prepared, and rhythmic production has been organized according to instruction charts, etc., but there are still many shortcomings. Specific requirements for these three types of factories should be different in the second half of the year. For factories that lack the basic conditions for preparing operation plans, the main task in the second half of the year is to prepare conditions (including studying production tasks, formulating preliminary quotas, adjusting the organization of production labor, arranging processes, etc.); for factories that already have the basic conditions for preparing operation plans, the task in the second half of the year is to make some necessary adjustments to the existing conditions, and after serious study, immediately start preparing operation plans, and gradually improve and improve various conditions in the process of preparing and implementing operation plans; for factories that have already prepared operation plans and initially organized balanced production, the task in the second half of the year is to summarize existing experience, check shortcomings in the work, and strive to achieve comprehensive balanced production with the processing workshop as the center.

The meeting also analyzed the situation of the ministry's capital construction work in the first half of the year. This year's capital construction work has many shortcomings in planning, design, equipment, materials, construction, and production preparation due to hasty preparation, so the plan for the first half of the year could not be completed. Of the thirty-one projects designed by the ministry itself, only one project was not overdue. The quality of the projects that have started construction is also not good, and the chaos in construction management is also very serious.

After analyzing the basic situation and existing problems of the ministry's capital construction, the meeting decided that in the design work in the second half of the year, the main thing is to strengthen the control of the design progress plan, improve the organization and leadership of the design work through the control of the plan, and criticize various erroneous design ideas in the process of checking the design quality. The central work of construction in the second half of the year is to promote preliminary construction operation plans, improve site organization, establish a responsibility system, launch a quality inspection campaign, establish a quality responsibility system, and combine the above work to promote advanced construction experience. In addition, the meeting decided to step up preparations for the construction of new factories in 1954. (Jiang Yiwei)

    第一机械工业部具体安排下半年中心工作
    确定以作业计划为中心加强计划管理工作
    中央人民政府第一机械工业部在七月二日至十日，召开部务会议，汇报并研究了各地生产与基本建设的情况，并针对这些情况，作出了对下半年中心工作的具体安排。
    第一机械工业部上半年生产总值虽然完成了国家计划，但在二十八种主要产品中，有十三种没有完成计划。生产的均衡性非常差，各工厂在生产管理上还有着不同程度的混乱现象。三月底，该部召开了厂长会议，曾布置各厂以加强计划管理为中心工作，进行生产管理的改革。几个月来，少数工厂在加强计划管理的工作上，已作出一些成绩，但还有些工厂不知从何下手；有些工厂虽已作了一些工作，如整顿原始记录和加强定额管理等，但是思想上没有明确认识到应以作业计划为计划管理的中心环节，因而仍然没有真正克服生产中混乱的突击现象。
    该部部务会议分析和研究了各厂的情况后，确定下半年在生产方面，以编制和贯彻作业计划为中心，加强企业的计划管理工作，争取全面地均衡地完成与超额完成国家计划。
    由于机械工业的复杂性与发展的不平衡性，会议认为该部现有企业大体上可以按生产形式的不同而分为三种类型：第一种是产品单一，大批生产；第二种是产品类型单一而规格复杂，大批或小批生产；第三种是产品复杂，小批或单件生产。这三种不同类型的工厂，在编制作业计划的具体方法上，应有所不同。会议指定了三个专业局负责召开小型会议进行研究。
    另一方面，会议又分析了各厂按生产改革进度的不同，也可分为三类：第一类是生产改革工作作得不多，进行编制作业计划还缺乏基本条件；第二类是生产改革工作进行了一些，编制作业计划的条件，如原始记录、各种基本的定额等都已经有了一些，但不够完整；第三类是生产管理工作作得比较多一些，作业计划已经编制，并能按指示图表组织有节奏生产等，但还有很多缺点。对这三类工厂下半年的具体要求应有所不同。对编制作业计划还缺乏基本条件的工厂，下半年主要的任务是准备条件（包括研究生产任务、制定初步的定额、调整生产劳动组织、排列工序等）；对已经具备编制作业计划基本条件的工厂，下半年的任务是对已有条件作若干必要的整理工作，经过认真的学习之后，即着手编制作业计划，在编制与贯彻作业计划的过程中，逐步地健全与提高各种条件；对已经编制作业计划、初步组织了均衡生产的工厂，下半年的任务是总结已有的经验，检查工作中的缺点，以加工车间为中心，争取做到全面的均衡生产。
    会议同时也分析了上半年该部基本建设工作的情况。今年的基本建设工作，由于准备仓促，计划、设计、设备、材料、施工以及生产准备等工作都有许多缺点，以致上半年计划未能完成。该部自己设计的三十一个项目，只有一个项目没有脱期。已开工的工程的质量也不好，施工管理的混乱情况也很严重。
    会议分析了该部基本建设的基本情况与存在的问题后，决定下半年在设计工作上，主要的是要加强对设计进度计划的掌握，通过计划的掌握，改进设计工作的组织与领导，并且在检查设计质量的过程中，来批判各种错误的设计思想。下半年施工的中心工作是推行初步的施工作业计划，健全工地组织，建立责任制，开展质量检查运动，建立质量责任制，并结合以上工作，推广施工的先进经验。此外，会议并决定加紧进行一九五四年新厂建设的筹备工作。　（蒋一苇）
