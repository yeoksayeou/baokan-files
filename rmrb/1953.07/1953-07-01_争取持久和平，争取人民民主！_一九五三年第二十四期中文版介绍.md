The Chinese edition of Issue 24, 1953, of the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Great Victory of the Democratic Forces in Italy," commenting on the results of the recent parliamentary elections in Italy. The editorial states: The Italian general election held in early June marked an important stage in the Italian people's tenacious struggle for peace, democracy, economic and social progress. This election was a brilliant victory for the national democratic forces. Nearly ten million voters voted for candidates of the democratic parties, and the Christian Democratic Party did not obtain the absolute majority they had hoped for in the Chamber of Deputies. This proves that the Italian people have begun to abandon the parties and governments that ignore the people's desire for peace and democracy and are committed to exacerbating international tensions. The editorial concludes: Now, the Italian Communist Party faces the arduous and glorious task of uniting the Italian Socialist Party and leading the working people and all progressive forces to the victory of peace, democracy and socialism.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Polish Agriculture on the Road of Socialist Transformation" by E. Pszczółkowski, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; "Striving for Greater Achievements in the Rural Work of the French Communist Party" by Waldeck Rochet, member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party; and "The Albanian Labor Party Struggles to Complete the Five-Year Plan" by K. Teodosi, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party.

Pszczółkowski's article points out that since the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party was held last June, the scale of development of agricultural production cooperatives in Poland has been growing. By May of this year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Poland had more than doubled, uniting 146,500 peasant households. The article points out that the struggle to develop production cooperatives is inextricably linked with political work in rural areas. In implementing the instructions of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, Party organizations in various regions have launched large-scale mass political work in rural areas, enriched the methods of propaganda and mobilization, and overcome the opportunism manifested in the inadequate assessment of production cooperatives in some work. In the process of developing production cooperatives, the examples of successful production cooperatives and the propaganda about the great achievements of Soviet collective farms have played a significant role. In order to promote the achievements of production cooperatives, local people's congresses, Party organizations, and social groups have done a lot of political and organizational work among the peasant masses, such as organizing individual peasants to visit production cooperatives collectively and inviting individual peasants to participate in the meetings of production cooperative members to discuss the distribution of income, so as to enable individual peasants to directly understand the life of production cooperatives, thereby eliminating their doubts. Now, Party organizations are still using various forms of mass political work to promote the idea of collectivism. Thousands of production cooperative members have become excellent propagandists in this regard. The article concludes that the development of production cooperatives requires Party committees and local people's congresses at all levels to improve their work style, implement a correct division of labor, and requires the state machine—tractor stations—the foundation for the development of agricultural production cooperatives—to have skilled leadership.

Rochet's article points out that the results of the recent French municipal elections show that the French Communist Party has maintained and strengthened its position among the peasantry. The French working peasants are clearly increasingly turning to the Communist Party, believing that the Communist Party is the only party that defends their rights, peace and national independence. To achieve success in rural areas, the Communist Party must first rely on the political work of Party organizations among the peasant masses. Wherever the main focus of work is on the most exploited working peasants, wherever the Party's rural branches organize struggles to defend the interests of the peasants, regularly refute the slanders of the enemy, expose the faces of various bourgeois political groups, more widely publicize the Party's program, promote the achievements of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and help establish peasant peace committees, the Party will be able to consolidate and strengthen its position. The article also analyzes the economic status and demands of various strata of working peasants in France and criticizes the shortcomings of some organizations of the French Communist Party in rural work.

Teodosi's article describes the great achievements made by Albania in the three years of implementing its first five-year plan (1951-1955) and analyzes the problems existing in labor organization, cadre training, and rural work during the implementation of the plan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十四期中文版介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十四期中文版已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“意大利民主力量的巨大胜利”的社论，评论意大利最近议会选举的结果。社论说：六月初举行的意大利大选，标志了意大利人民争取和平、民主、经济和社会进步的顽强斗争的一个重要阶段。这次选举是全国民主力量的辉煌胜利，差不多有一千万选民投票选举民主党派的候选人，天主教民主党并没有在下院获得他们所期望的绝大多数。这就证明了意大利人民已经开始离弃那无视人民爱好和平、民主的愿望而致力于加剧国际紧张局势的党派和政府。社论最后说：现在，意大利共产党面前还摆着艰巨而光荣的任务：联合意大利社会党，领导劳动人民和所有进步力量走向和平、民主和社会主义事业的胜利。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记埃·普什楚尔科夫斯基的“波兰农业在社会主义改造的道路上”，法国共产党政治局委员瓦德克·罗歇的“争取法国共产党农村工作获得更大的成就”，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员科·蒂奥多西的“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为完成五年计划而斗争”。
    普什楚尔科夫斯基的文章指出：自从波兰统一工人党中央委员会去年六月举行第七次全体会议以来，波兰农业生产合作社发展的规模是日益宏大了。到今年五月，波兰农业生产合作社的数目已经增加了一倍多，团结了十四万六千五百家农户。文章指出：发展生产合作社的斗争，是跟农村政治工作不可分地联系着的。各地的党组织在执行党中央第七次全会的指示时，已在农村大规模地展开了群众政治工作，丰富了宣传鼓动的方式，并克服了在某些工作上所表现的对生产合作社估计不足的机会主义。在发展生产合作社的过程中，成绩卓著的生产合作社的范例和关于苏联集体农庄巨大成就的宣传，发生了巨大的作用。为了宣传生产合作社的成就，地方人民议会、党组织和社会团体在农民群众中已做了许多政治工作和组织工作，如组织个体农民集体参观生产合作社，邀请个体农民参加生产合作社社员讨论分配收入的会议等等，以便使个体农民直接了解生产合作社的生活，从而消除他们的怀疑。现在党的组织还在运用各种群众政治工作方式，宣传集体主义的思想。成千上万的生产合作社社员在这方面成了优秀的鼓动员。文章最后说：生产合作社的发展要求各级党委员会和地方人民议会改进工作作风、实行正确的分工，并要求国家机器拖拉机站——农业生产合作社发展的基础——有熟练的领导。
    罗歇的文章指出，最近法国市选举的结果，显示法国共产党保持了并加强了自己在农民中的地位。法国的劳动农民显然是在愈来愈多地转向共产党，认为共产党是唯一维护他们的权利、维护和平和民族独立的政党。共产党要在农村中获得成就，首先要依靠党组织在农民群众中的政治工作。凡是在工作中把主要注意力集中在受剥削最重的劳动农民身上的地方，凡是党的农村支部组织了斗争来保卫农民的利益、经常驳斥敌人的诽谤、揭露资产阶级各种政治集团的面目、更广泛地宣传党的纲领、宣传苏联和人民民主国家的成就、帮助成立农民和平委员会的地方，党就能够巩固和加强自己的地位。文章还分析了法国各劳动农民阶层的经济地位和要求，批评了法国共产党的某些组织在农村工作中的缺点。
    蒂奥多西的文章叙述了阿尔巴尼亚执行第一个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）三年中所取得的巨大成就，分析了在执行计划时，在劳动组织、干部培养和农村工作中所存在的问题。（新华社）
