    The May wind,
    Brushes the wheat tips.
    Not yet filled,
    But already half a foot high.
   "Another year of good harvest,"
    The farmers tell each other happily.
    Those who speak laugh,
    Those who listen also laugh.
    Sister-in-law Zhang returns from the market,
    Calculating as she walks,
    How to write a letter to report to him:
    "Last year was a twelve-tenth harvest,
    Enough to eat and wear, with plenty left over;
    This year the wheat will be a bumper harvest again,
    Life will get better year after year.
    I have joined the Communist Youth League
    And also attend night school,
    Learning three thousand characters a month,
    Not only can I write letters,
    But I can also read newspapers.
    Don't think about anything,
    Just focus on fighting the war well,
    I don't expect anything,
    Only hope you send back news of a meritorious service."
    The more Sister-in-law Zhang thought, the happier she became, joy in her heart, a smile on her face.

    军属的心愿
    马爱群五月的风，
    拂着麦梢。
    还没灌浆哩，
    足足有尺半高。
   “今年又是个丰收年”，
    农民们欣喜相告。
    说着的笑，
    听着的也笑。
    张二嫂赶集回来，
    一边走一边盘算，
    怎么写信向他报告：
    “去年十二成年景，
    吃了穿了还剩了不少；
    今年麦子又要大丰收，
    生活一年会比一年好。
    我参加了青年团
    又上了夜校，
    一个月认了三千字，
    不光会写信，
    还会看书报。
    你啥也别想，
    只想怎着把仗打好，
    我啥也不盼，
    只盼你寄回张立功喜报。”
    张二嫂越想越高兴，喜在心里，笑在眉梢。
