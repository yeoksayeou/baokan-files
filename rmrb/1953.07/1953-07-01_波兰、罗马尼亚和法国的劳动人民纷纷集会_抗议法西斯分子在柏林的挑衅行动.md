(Xinhua News Agency, 30th) The laboring people of Poland, Romania, and France have protested against the provocations orchestrated by foreign fascists in Berlin and expressed their support for the laboring people of Democratic Germany.

    In Poland, the laboring people of Warsaw, miners and metallurgical workers of Silesia, Polish shipbuilding workers, railway workers, and construction workers unanimously condemned the instigators of the Berlin provocations. Workers at the Kościuszko Metallurgical Factory, construction workers at Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki, miners in Silesia, and other workers also unanimously condemned the vile adventures carried out by neo-Hitlerite conspirators in Berlin. Shipbuilding workers in Szczecin wrote a letter to the workers of the Rostock shipyard, assuring their German comrades of their solidarity with the laboring people of the German Democratic Republic and all patriotic forces in Germany in their struggle for a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany.

    Throughout Romania, the people held many rallies to protest the provocations of the enemies of peace in Germany. Many factories in Bucharest held large meetings at which the laboring people expressed their anger at the criminal actions of foreign mercenaries in Berlin and the imperialist bloc's attempts to prevent the easing of international tensions. Workers, engineers, and technicians at the Dinamo Factory issued a strong protest, expressing extreme hatred for the enemies of peace. The Vulcan Iron Works held a large meeting at which speakers expressed active support for the just struggle of the German people for the unification and independence of their homeland. Notora Mamera, a female worker at the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Garment Factory, said: "We all support the German people, support them in their struggle for a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany." Her words expressed the feelings in the hearts of thousands of female workers at the factory.

    Similar rallies were also held in other cities in Romania, including Craiova, Brăila, Târgu Mureș, Iași, Petroșani, etc.

    The Parisian newspaper "l'Humanité" reported that the secretariat of the National Association of Participants in the French Resistance wrote a letter to the Anti-Fascist Resistance Fighters Committee of the German Democratic Republic, saying that facts prove that everything was planned abroad in advance and that old and new fascists were used to overthrow the government of the German Democratic Republic. Because this attempt was suppressed as soon as it emerged, the opportunity for peace was saved, and those who were bent on turning Germany into another Korea were defeated.

    抗议法西斯分子在柏林的挑衅行动
    【新华社三十日讯】波兰、罗马尼亚和法国的劳动人民纷纷抗议外国法西斯分子在柏林策动的挑衅，并表示他们对民主德国劳动人民的支援。
    在波兰，华沙劳动人民、西里西亚的矿工和冶金工人、波兰造船工人、铁路工人和建筑工人一致指责柏林挑衅事件的策动者。科斯久什科冶金工厂的工人、诺威·特弗希的建筑工人、西里西亚的矿工和其他工人也一致谴责新希特勒阴谋分子在柏林进行的卑鄙的冒险。谢基佐泽齐赫造船工人写了一封信给罗斯托克造船厂的工人，向德国同志保证，他们声援德意志民主共和国劳动人民及德国所有爱国力量为争取建立一个统一、爱好和平的民主德国所进行的斗争。
    罗马尼亚各地的人民举行了许多集会，抗议和平的敌人在德国的挑衅。布加勒斯特许多工厂举行了大会，会上劳动人民对于外国雇佣分子在柏林的罪恶行动以及帝国主义集团企图阻止缓和国际局势的阴谋表示愤怒。狄纳莫工厂的工人、工程师和技术人员发出强烈的抗议，他们对于和平的敌人表示极端的仇恨。火神钢铁工厂举行了大会，在会上，发言的人表示积极支持德国人民争取统一和他们祖国独立的正义斗争。乔治乌—德治被服厂的女工诺托拉·马麦拉说：“我们都支援德国人民，支援他们为争取一个统一、民主与和平的德国而进行的斗争。”她的话表达了这个工厂成千的女工心中的感觉。
    在罗马尼亚的其他城市克罗什、布来拉、塔古尔谟勒斯、雅西、培亚马勃等等，也举行了同样的集会。
    巴黎“人道报”报道，法国全国抵抗运动参加者协会书记处写信给德意志民主共和国的反法西斯抵抗战士委员会说，事实证明，一切都事先在国外策划定当，新老法西斯分子都被使用，来推翻德意志民主共和国政府。由于这种企图刚一冒头时就被镇压下去，和平的机会得到挽救，那些一心想将德国变成另一个朝鲜的人遭到了失败。
