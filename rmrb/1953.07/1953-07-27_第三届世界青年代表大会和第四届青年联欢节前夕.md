    The Third World Youth Congress and the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship are about to open, and the days that youth from all countries have been longing for are finally about to arrive. Bucharest has already donned its festive attire. Arches have been erected on Nicolae Bălcescu Boulevard in the city center, and huge portraits of young athletes are placed along the roadside. National flags of various countries, the World Federation of Democratic Youth flag, and the festival flag are hung on the conference venue, the train station, and many buildings. Slogans such as "Peace and Friendship" written in various languages can be seen everywhere. At the entrance of the Baon University dormitory where the Chinese youth delegation is staying, the four Chinese characters "Welcome You" are written horizontally. Chinese pictures are hung everywhere in the stairwells and corridors.
    Construction work on various stadiums, theaters, and open-air theaters is in its final stage. The "August 23rd" Cultural and Sports Park, which will serve as the main venue for festival performances and competitions, is particularly noteworthy. Before March 15th, this was just a wasteland. In just over four months, Romanian youth have created a miracle with their own hands: a modern, huge stadium that can accommodate 80,000 people is almost complete. The stadium's running track is 400 meters long and has 18 entrances and underground entrances. All athletes will enter the stadium from their rest rooms via the underground entrances. The main stand is paved with marble in accordance with the Romanian national style. In addition to this huge stadium, the "August 23rd" Cultural and Sports Park also includes an open-air theater that can accommodate 2,000 people, built entirely in the classical Greek style, a puppet theater specially set up for children, a boxing ring that can accommodate 4,000 people, a garden, and a parachute jumping platform that is 80 meters high. Other important construction projects in Bucharest, such as the musical theater, the open-air theater and cinema in the Red Grivița district, and the summer competition field in Stalin Park, are also nearing completion. Romanian youth participated in the construction of various projects with great enthusiasm. They came from all over to participate in voluntary labor. More than 100 of them came from Făgăraș, which is 250 kilometers away from Bucharest. According to statistics, the hundreds of thousands of young people and Bucharest residents who participated in the labor contributed a total of more than 784,000 hours of voluntary labor.
    The scale of this World Youth Congress and Festival will be unprecedented. The Second World Youth Congress held in Budapest in 1949 had more than 700 representatives from 72 countries. It is estimated that more than 1,500 representatives from 100 countries will participate in this congress. The scale of this festival is even greater. The Third Festival held in Berlin in 1951 had youth representatives from 104 countries participating, while this festival, based on current figures alone, will have 106 countries participating. Many young people from capitalist and colonial countries are organizing delegations several times larger than in previous festivals to participate, despite various difficulties. Austrian youth have already announced that they will send 2,000 people to participate in the festival, Finland announced that it will send 3,000 people, and France will send 3,500 people. Not only is the number large, but the composition of youth delegations from various countries is also much broader than before. In addition to the member organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, many non-member organizations will also send representatives to participate. Youth delegations from various countries will have many young people from different classes, different occupations, and different political and religious beliefs participating. For example, the British delegation will be composed of representatives from the Derbyshire Miners' Association, the London Catholic Youth Association, the West Blagdon Youth Baptist Association, and the Cambridge University Medical Students Association, and other groups with different beliefs. The Japanese delegation includes metal workers, miners, farmers, students, office workers, film actors, and singers. The Chilean delegation includes not only young communists, but also young people from the Radical Party, the Socialist Party, and the People's Party. All of this shows that the ranks of peace and democratic youth have expanded even more in the past two or three years, and unity has become even closer. In addition, many famous people will participate in this conference and festival, including Ikuo Oyama and Blanco. Other famous people such as Picasso, Guo Moruo, and Bechir have also sent letters expressing their support and concern for this conference and festival.
    The festival, which will be held immediately after the World Youth Congress, will enable young people from various countries to increase mutual understanding and friendship through literary and artistic and sports activities, and strengthen the unity of young people around the world to fight for peace and the vital interests of youth. The festival will hold its opening ceremony on August 2nd. On this day, a grand parade of 80,000 young people will be held, and the International Peace Relay Race will arrive at this time. International art competitions will begin on the 3rd. Young people from various countries will present their most exciting programs in this competition. In addition to national programs from various countries, many countries will also jointly organize international programs. International sports friendship matches will begin on the 4th. The 6th is the day for advocating consultations among the five major powers. On this day, a conference on the peaceful resolution of international disputes with more than 4,000 participants will be held, and youth representatives from the five major powers will also meet on this day. The 7th is Women's Youth Day. The 13th is Support for Colonial Youth Day. The festival will close on the 16th. A solemn oath will be taken at that time. In addition to these main activities, during the festival, various activities such as get-togethers and visits between young people from various countries, seaside activities, campfires, exchange of commemorative badges, and exchange of stamps will be organized every day.
    The world youth festival is about to arrive. The twenty-odd days starting from July 25th will be extraordinary. During these twenty-odd days, young people from all over the world will hold an unprecedentedly great peace demonstration. There is no doubt that it will attract thousands upon thousands of young people who have not yet taken action to fight for peace and for a happy life for young people.

    第三届世界青年代表大会和第四届青年联欢节前夕
    新华社记者  言彪
    第三届世界青年代表大会和第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节就要开幕了，各国青年望眼欲穿的日子终于就要到来了。布加勒斯特已经披上了节日的服装，市中心的尼古拉·巴尔切斯库大街上已经建立起牌坊，路旁树立着青年运动员的巨幅画像，大会会场及车站和许多建筑物上都悬挂着各国国旗、世界民主青年联盟盟旗和联欢节的会旗。到处可以看到用各种文字写成的“和平与友谊”的标语。在中国青年代表团住的巴洪大学宿舍门口，用中文横写着“欢迎你们”四个大字，楼梯和走廊上也到处悬挂着中国的图片。
    各处运动场、戏院、露天剧场的建筑工程都已进入最后阶段了。作为联欢节主要表演和竞赛场所的“八月二十三日”文化体育公园是特别值得一提的。三月十五日以前这里还不过是一片荒地，在短短的四个多月中，罗马尼亚的青年用他们的双手创造了奇迹：一个可容八万人的现代化巨大运动场差不多就要完工了，这个运动场的跑道长达四百公尺，有十八个入口和地下入口，所有运动员都将从他们的休息室经由地下入口走进运动场来。主要看台是按照罗马尼亚的民族风格用大理石铺盖起来的。除了这个巨大的运动场以外，“八月二十三日”文化体育公园还包括一个完全按照希腊古典式样建筑的可容两千人的露天剧场，一个专为儿童设立的木偶剧场，一个可容四千人的拳击场，一个花园和一所高达八十公尺的跳伞台。布加勒斯特的其他重要工程，如音乐剧院、红色格利维查区的露天剧场和电影院、斯大林公园的夏季竞赛场等工程，也都接近完工了。罗马尼亚的青年用极大的热情参加了各种工程的建筑。他们从各处跑来参加义务劳动，其中有一百多人是从距离布加勒斯特二百五十公里远的弗各拉什来的，根据统计，参加劳动的好几十万青年和布加勒斯特居民，义务劳动时间共达七十八万四千小时以上。
    这次世界青年代表大会和联欢节的规模将是空前巨大的。一九四九年在布达佩斯举行的第二届世界青年代表大会，共有七十二个国家的七百多名的代表。据估计，参加这次大会的将有一百个国家的一千五百多名代表。这次联欢节的规模更加巨大。一九五一年在柏林举行的第三届联欢节共有一百零四个国家的青年代表参加，而这次联欢节仅根据目前的数字，就会有一百零六个国家参加。许多资本主义国家和殖民地国家的青年，都不顾种种困难，组织比过去几次联欢节大好几倍的代表团来参加。奥地利青年已经宣布将派出两千人参加联欢节，芬兰宣布要派出三千人，法国将派出三千五百人。不仅人数众多，各国青年代表团的成份也比以前广泛得多了。除了世界民主青联的会员团体以外，还将有许多非会员团体派遣代表参加。各国青年代表团都将有许多不同阶层、不同职业、不同政治和宗教信仰的青年参加。例如英国代表团将由德尔柏矿工协会、伦敦天主教青年协会、西布莱格福青年浸礼教徒协会和剑桥大学医学生协会等等信仰不同的团体的代表组成。日本代表团中有五金工人、矿工、农民、学生、职员、电影演员和歌唱家。智利的代表团中不仅有年青的共产党员，而且有激进党、社会党和人民党的青年。所有这些都说明：两三年来和平民主青年的队伍是更加扩大了，团结是更加紧密了。此外，参加这次大会和联欢节还将有许多著名人士，其中包括大山郁夫和布兰柯，其他著名人士如毕加索、郭沫若、贝希尔等也都来信表示支持和关怀这次大会和联欢节。
    紧接着世界青年代表大会之后举行的联欢节，将使各国青年通过文艺和体育活动增加彼此了解和友谊，加强全世界青年的团结，来为争取和平和青年切身利益而斗争。联欢节将在八月二日举行开幕式，八万青年队伍将在这一天举行盛大的游行，国际和平接力跑将在这时到达。三日起开始举行国际文艺竞赛。各国青年都将在这次竞赛中拿出自己的最精彩的节目来。除了各国国家节目之外，许多国家还将共同组织国际节目。四日开始举行国际体育友谊赛。六日是争取五大国协商的日子，在这一天将举行有四千多人参加的和平解决国际争端大会，五大国青年代表也将在这一天会面。七日是女青年日。十三日是支持殖民地青年日。联欢节将在十六日闭幕。届时将举行庄严的宣誓。除了这些主要的活动之外，在联欢节期间每天还将组织各国青年之间的联欢及参观旅行、海滨活动、营火、交换纪念章、交换集邮等多种多样的活动。
    世界青年的节日就要到来了。从七月二十五日开始的二十多天将是不平凡的二十多天。世界各国的青年将在这二十多天里举行一个空前伟大的和平示威。毫无疑问它将吸引成千上万至今还没有行动起来的青年，为争取和平、为争取青年的幸福生活而奋斗。
