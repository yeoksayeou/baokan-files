    Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: According to TASS, Moscow newspapers on the 16th continued to report on the meetings of Party Committees of various Soviet republics, with Party activists participating, and mass rallies held by the working people. These meetings discussed the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet regarding Beria's crimes. The communists and working people present at the meetings denounced Beria, the hireling of international imperialism, and unanimously expressed their support for the policies of the Party and the government.

    The plenary sessions of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the various republics fully demonstrated that the Party organizations of the republics are united around the Central Committee of the CPSU. At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan held on the 14th, Babayev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan, made a report on the summary of the Central Committee of the CPSU. He and those who spoke in the discussion expressed that the Party organization of Turkmenistan unanimously supports the firm and timely measures taken by the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to liquidate Beria's crimes. The joint plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan and the Stalinabad City Committee was held in Stalinabad. Gafurov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, who made a report at the meeting, and others who spoke in the discussion, talked about the warm support of the communists and all the working people of Tajikistan for the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU. The meeting called on the Party organizations of the republic to raise political vigilance and improve the level of organizational and political work. At the joint plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia and the Yerevan City Committee, the secretary of the Armenian Writers Association, the poet Baoliang, said: Thanks to the political sensitivity of our Party Central Committee, the mask of the despicable enemy Beria has been torn off. The exposure of the traitor will promote the further strengthening of one of the foundations of our multi-ethnic country - the friendship between all nationalities.

    The working people in various parts of the Soviet Union continue to hold mass rallies. Speakers at the meetings condemned the crimes of the people's enemy Beria. At the staff meeting of the Mankin Logging Bureau in the Karelia-Finland Republic, logger Karlhu said: Beria attempted to undermine the unbreakable unity of the Party, the government, and the Soviet people. This hostile conspiracy did not succeed and could not succeed. Our people are closely united around the Party and the government, fully support their policies, and all the enemies' conspiracies are shattered by this unity. At the meeting of all construction workers at the newly electrified Shishankou Hydropower Station in Kazakhstan, cement worker Kalimbayev said: The traitor Beria violated the most precious and sacred thing for all of us - the friendship between the Soviet nationalities. We curse this traitor. The friendship between the Soviet nationalities is unshakable, because this friendship is cultivated by our Communist Party.

    Soviet collective farmers also expressed unparalleled anger at Beria's sabotage activities. Peasant rallies have been held in various villages in Ukraine and Belarus. At the peasant rally in the Andreyev Collective Farm in Kursk Oblast, old farmer Grichyanikov said: We sincerely thank the Party and the government for exposing the deadly enemy of the people in time and preventing him from doing harm. Beria wanted to destroy and trample on the collective farm system that we have built through persistent struggle and labor. But this will not happen! Our collective farm system is indestructible!

    苏联各加盟共和国党组织和劳动人民拥护党和政府清洗叛徒贝利亚的决定
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社消息：莫斯科各报十六日继续报道苏联各加盟共和国党委会举行有党的活动分子参加的全体会议和劳动人民举行群众大会的消息。这些会议讨论了苏联共产党中央全体会议和最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚罪行的决定。到会的共产党员和劳动人民，纷纷痛斥国际帝国主义的雇佣分子贝利亚，一致表示拥护党和政府的政策。
    各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会的全体会议，充分表明各共和国党组织是团结在苏共中央周围的。在土库曼共和国共产党中央委员会十四日举行的全体会议上，土库曼共和国共产党中央委员会书记巴巴耶夫做了关于苏共中央的总结的报告。他和在讨论中发言的人都表示土库曼的党组织一致拥护苏联共产党中央委员会主席团为清算贝利亚的罪行而采取的坚决和及时的措施。塔吉克共和国共产党中央委员会和斯大林纳巴德市委员会的联合全体会议，在斯大林纳巴德举行。在会上做报告的塔吉克共和国共产党中央委员会书记加佛罗夫，和其他在讨论中发言的人，都谈到了塔吉克的共产党员和全体劳动人民热烈支持苏共中央全体会议的决定。会议号召共和国的党组织提高政治警惕性，提高组织工作和政治工作的水平。在亚美尼亚共产党中央委员会和埃里温市委会联合举行的全体会议上，亚美尼亚作家协会书记、诗人保良发言说：由于我们党中央委员会的政治敏感，可恶的敌人贝利亚的假面具被扯下来了。卖国贼的被揭发将促进我们多民族国家的基础之一——各民族之间的友谊的进一步加强。
    苏联各地劳动人民继续举行群众大会。在会上发言的人痛斥了人民敌人贝利亚的罪行。在卡累利阿—芬兰共和国的曼金伐木场的工作人员大会上，伐木工人卡尔胡说：贝利亚企图破坏党、政府和苏联人民的牢不可破的团结。这种敌意的阴谋并没有成功，而且也是不可能成功的。我们的人民紧密团结在党和政府的周围，充分支持它们的政策，敌人的一切阴谋都被这种团结所粉碎。在哈萨克刚刚送电的石山口水电站全体建筑工人会议上，水泥工人卡里姆巴耶夫说：卖国贼贝利亚侵害了我们大家最宝贵的、最神圣的东西——苏联各民族的友谊。我们咒骂这个叛徒。苏联各民族的友谊是不可动摇的，因为这种友谊是我们的共产党所锻炼出来的。
    苏联集体农民对贝利亚的破坏活动也表示了无比的愤怒。乌克兰和白俄罗斯的各乡村中已经举行了农民大会。在库尔斯克州安德烈耶夫集体农庄农民集会上，老农民格里契雅尼阔夫说：我们衷心感谢党和政府及时地揭发了人民的死敌，并使他不能为害。贝利亚想破坏、蹂躏我们从坚持不懈的斗争中和劳动中建立起来的集体农庄制度。但是这种事是不会发生的！我们集体农庄制度是不可摧毁的！
