Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government held a national railway work conference from June 16th to July 1st. The conference heard and discussed Minister Teng Daiyuan’s report on "Inspection of Current Work and Central Tasks for 1953," Political Department Director Tan Guangting’s report on "Political Work on Railway Operating Lines in 1953," and the Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union of China, Wang Zhijie’s report on "The Work of the Railway Trade Union in the Past Two Years and Work Tasks for 1953." Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of the State Council of the Central People's Government attended the meeting and gave important instructions. The meeting reviewed the work of the past few years in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism and determined that the national railways should, in the next three to five years, take "Conscientiously Implementing the Study and Promotion of the Experience of the Former Chinese Changchun Railway" as the guiding principle for their work.

Over the past three years, the achievements of China's railway work have been significant. The national railways have not only restored and strengthened the old lines, built 1,400 kilometers of new lines, repaired a large number of locomotives and vehicles, and built some new locomotives and vehicles, but also carried out a series of political movements, completed democratic reforms, and carried out some production reform work. In various political movements and labor competitions, more than 20,000 labor models and advanced workers have emerged, thereby enhancing the political awareness of the vast number of employees and railway transportation efficiency, and completing the transportation tasks of supporting the Liberation War, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and national economic construction. However, there are still errors and shortcomings in the work of the national railways, the most important of which is the failure to clearly propose learning from and promoting the experience of the former Chinese Changchun Railway as a guiding principle for work, and the failure to formulate specific plans and steps to effectively organize and implement it, thus failing to achieve the due results. At the meeting, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of the State Council and Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways both pointed out in their instructions and reports that the reasons for these errors and shortcomings are mainly due to complacency with the achievements made and the growth of arrogance, thus lacking sensitivity to new things.

After earnestly discussing the instructions of Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping and the reports of Minister Teng Daiyuan and others, the meeting believed that in order to make railway work continue to move forward, it is necessary to carry forward achievements and correct shortcomings. The meeting determined that the guiding principle for work in the next three to five years should be "Conscientiously Implementing the Study and Promotion of the Experience of the Former Chinese Changchun Railway." In order to implement this guiding principle and ensure the completion of the national railway production and financial plan for this year, the central tasks for the second half of this year are: (1) Combined with the organization of cadres to study the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), organize the study of the experience of the former Chinese Changchun Railway, review the current rules and regulations, those that are consistent with the experience of the former Chinese Changchun Railway should be resolutely implemented, those that are missing should be supplemented, and those that are wrong should be corrected. Each railway administration should organize the study under the leadership of the director, and formulate plans for training cadres and technicians according to specific circumstances. The Harbin Railway Administration should vigorously consolidate the work achievements of the former Chinese Changchun Railway and gradually improve them, and prevent complacency. (2) Strengthen planned management, rectify institutions, improve labor organization, formulate job details, and establish and improve the responsibility system. (3) Deepen the struggle against bureaucracy, overcome the phenomena of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and decentralism in leading organs and leading cadres at all levels, and the "five excesses" phenomenon in grassroots units.

    铁道部召开铁路工作会议
    确定切实学习与推广原中国长春铁路经验
    【新华社四日讯】中央人民政府铁道部于六月十六日到七月一日召开了全国铁路工作会议。会议听取并讨论了滕代远部长“关于目前工作检查和一九五三年的中心工作”的报告、政治部谭光廷主任“关于一九五三年铁路营业线路政治工作”的报告和中国铁路工会全国委员会王志杰秘书长“关于铁路工会两年来工作情况和一九五三年工作任务”的报告。中央人民政府政务院邓小平副总理到会作了重要指示。会议以批评与自我批评的精神检查了几年来的工作，并确定全国铁路在今后三、五年内以“切实贯彻学习和推广原中国长春铁路的经验”为工作方针。
    三年来，我国铁路工作的成绩是很大的。全国铁路不仅恢复和补强了旧线，新建了一千四百多公里的新线，修复了大量的机车、车辆，新造了一部分机车和车辆，而且开展了一系列的政治运动，完成了民主改革，进行了若干生产改革工作。在各种政治运动和劳动竞赛中，涌现出劳动模范、先进工作者两万多人，从而提高了广大职工的政治觉悟和铁路运输效率，完成了支援解放战争、抗美援朝斗争和国家经济建设的运输任务。但是全国铁路工作中也还存在着错误和缺点，最主要的是没有明确地提出以学习与推广原中国长春铁路经验为工作方针，没有订出具体计划和步骤，切实组织贯彻，因而没有取得应有的成绩。会上，政务院邓小平副总理的指示和铁道部滕代远部长的报告中都指出：产生这些错误和缺点的原因，主要是满足于既得成绩，滋长了骄傲情绪，因而对于新鲜事物缺乏敏感。
    会议在认真地讨论了邓小平副总理的指示和滕代远部长等的报告以后，认为要使铁路工作继续前进，必须发扬成绩，纠正缺点。会议确定今后三、五年内的工作方针，应为“切实贯彻学习和推广原中国长春铁路的经验”。为了贯彻这一方针，保证完成今年全国铁路的生产财务计划，今年下半年的中心工作是：（一）和组织干部学习联共（布）党史结合起来，组织学习原中国长春铁路的经验，审查现行规章制度，其中和原中国长春铁路经验一致的应坚决贯彻，缺少的应补充，错误的应修正。各管理局由局长领导组织学习，并根据具体情况，订出培养干部、技术人员的计划。哈尔滨铁路管理局应大力巩固原中国长春铁路的工作成果，并逐步加以提高，防止自满。（二）加强计划管理，整顿机构，改善劳动组织，制订职务细则，建立与健全责任制。（三）深入反官僚主义斗争，克服各级领导机关和领导干部的主观主义、官僚主义、分散主义的现象和基层单位的“五多”现象。
