Xinjiang Province and City level agencies, with over nine thousand eight hundred cadres from various ethnic groups, having completed their study of the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and based on instructions from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee, have decided to dedicate half a year, from June 1st to the end of the year, to studying the theories and policies on ethnic issues, in coordination with the Party's current tasks in Xinjiang.

During the study of the 19th Party Congress documents, cadres in the province initially improved their study habits, and their ideological level also rose. While studying Malenkov's report, leading Party and government comrades gave a total of nine major reports to cadres of all ethnic groups. Drawing on the experience of high-level cadres in Northeast China in studying theory, nineteen comrades, including members of the Xinjiang Bureau and leaders of various departments, formed a core group, with Xinjiang Bureau Secretary Wang Enmao and Zhang Bangying as group leaders and Zhao Shougong, head of the Xinjiang Bureau's Propaganda Department, as deputy group leader. The core group studied the documents in advance, promptly collected feedback from below to enrich the study content, and were responsible for giving study reports to all cadres. The Ürümqi city-level agencies also established a high-level group led by Liu He, Deputy Secretary of the Ürümqi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Because the comrades in the core group and the high-level group were able to provide specific guidance for the study and conscientiously study the documents as role models, strictly abide by the study system and discipline, they greatly promoted the study of all cadres.

During the study, the leadership paid special attention to providing specific assistance to local ethnic minority cadres. For example, due to differences in language and writing, different study requirements and methods were determined. Study materials were printed in Uyghur, Kazakh, Han and other ethnic minority languages and distributed to cadres of all ethnic groups; when giving reports to all cadres, they were broadcast in several languages, and specialists were assigned to explain the documents to local ethnic minority cadres. In addition, local ethnic minority cadres and Han cadres often formed groups to hold discussion meetings and forums to exchange study experiences and insights. This achieved the purpose of strengthening mutual understanding and unity between local ethnic minority cadres and outside cadres through study, which was of great help in jointly carrying out the work. In studying the third part of Malenkov's report, various agencies combined the spirit of the document to carry out self-criticism from below, and further examined the Great Han chauvinism tendencies of some outside cadres in cadre relations. When Xinjiang Bureau Secretary Wang Enmao gave a report to cadres on carrying out self-criticism and criticism from below, he also specifically pointed out that in order to promote ethnic unity, it is necessary to continue to overcome Great Han chauvinism tendencies in the future, which greatly enlightened and improved all cadres ideologically, and was very helpful in improving future work. Many cadres reported that the gains from this study were unmatched by any previous one. Cadres of all ethnic groups deeply felt that in order to further improve their work, they must systematically and deeply study the theories and policies of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong on ethnic issues.

To this end, the Xinjiang Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principles of the instructions of the Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau, decided that all cadres of provincial and municipal level agencies should begin studying the theory and policies on ethnic issues from June. The study requires the implementation of the resolution of the Second Congress of the Xinjiang Party last year, continuing to overcome various ideological viewpoints that violate the Party's ethnic policies (mainly Great Han chauvinism tendencies), overcoming ideological styles that do not proceed from actual ethnic characteristics and are simplistic and impatient, strengthening cadre unity, and jointly doing a good job.

Before the start of this study, all units carried out a rectification work from the organizational and ideological aspects according to the specific situation, and strengthened the ideological and organizational leadership of the study. For example, under the leadership of the Provincial Agency General Study Committee, each unit reorganized its branch study committees, and some have begun to equip themselves with full-time study secretaries (previously all were part-time), and established theoretical instructors and study counselors for each system and unit. Study groups have also been appropriately adjusted according to the cultural and theoretical level of cadres. At the same time, past learning experiences were studied, and the incorrect learning attitudes of some comrades were criticized. This will be of great help in further improving study habits and improving study results in the future.

    新疆省、市两级机关各民族干部学习关于民族问题的理论和政策
    新疆省、市级机关各民族干部九千八百余人，在学完苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件的基础上，根据中共中央和中共中央西北局的指示，配合党在新疆当前的任务，决定从六月一日起到年底止，以半年时间进行有关民族问题的理论和政策的学习。
    该省干部在第十九次党代表大会文件的学习中，初步健全了学习生活，思想水平也有所提高。在学习马林科夫报告时，党政负责同志先后向各族干部作了九次大报告。吸取东北高级干部学习理论的经验，新疆分局委员及各部领导同志共十九人组成了核心小组，由分局书记王恩茂、张邦英两同志任组长，分局宣传部长赵守攻为副组长。核心小组提前学习文件，及时收集下面反映，以充实学习内容，并负责向全体干部作学习报告。迪化市级机关，也以中共迪化市委副书记刘鹤为组长，成立了一个高级组。由于核心小组及高级组同志能对学习作具体指导，并以身作则地认真钻研文件，严格遵守学习制度和纪律，对全体干部的学习起了极大的推动作用。
    在学习中，领导上特别注意对本地民族干部的具体帮助，如由于语言文字的不同，确定了不同的学习要求和学习方法。学习材料用维吾尔、哈萨克、汉等各民族文字印发给各民族干部；向全体干部作报告时，用几种语言播讲，并请专人负责给本地民族干部讲解文件。此外，本地民族干部和汉族干部也常合组开讨论会、座谈会，交流学习经验和心得等。这就达到通过学习加强本地民族干部和外来干部的相互了解和团结的目的，对共同搞好工作有很大帮助。在学习马林科夫报告第三部分中，各机关结合文件精神开展了自下而上的批评，在干部关系上，进一步检查了某些外来干部的大民族主义思想倾向。新疆分局王恩茂书记在给干部作关于开展自我批评和自下而上的批评的报告时，也特别指出为搞好民族团结，今后还要继续克服大民族主义思想倾向，使全体干部在思想上有了很大启发和提高，对改进今后工作很有帮助。许多干部反映：这次学习收获是以往任何一次所比不上的。各民族干部深感要进一步搞好工作，必须有系统地深入学习列宁、斯大林、毛泽东关于民族问题的理论和政策。
    为此，中共新疆分局特根据中央和西北局的指示原则，决定省市级机关全体干部从六月份起开始关于民族问题理论和政策的学习。在学习中要求贯彻新疆去年二届党代表大会的决议，继续克服各种违反党的民族政策的思想观点（主要是大民族主义的思想倾向），克服不从实际的民族特点出发及简单急躁的思想作风，加强干部团结，共同做好工作。
    在这次学习开始前，各单位都根据具体情况，从组织上、思想上进行了一次整顿工作，加强了对学习的思想领导和组织领导。如在省级机关总学委会领导下，各单位重新改组了分学委会，有的已开始配备了专职学习秘书（过去都是兼职），并建立了各系统、各单位的理论教员和学习辅导员。学习小组也按干部的文化、理论水平进行了适当调整。同时还研究了过去的学习经验，批评了有些同志的不正确的学习态度。这对今后进一步健全学习生活、提高学习效果，将有很大帮助。
