    Bloody Evidence
    Introducing the "Exhibition of Evidence of Imperialist Use of Catholicism for Conspiracy and Sabotage Activities" in Shanghai
    Tu Peilin
    Visiting the "Exhibition of Evidence of Imperialist Use of Catholicism for Conspiracy and Sabotage Activities" is a beneficial and profound anti-imperialist patriotic education for each of us. Many "missionaries" sent to China from abroad and distributed throughout the country, appear outwardly dignified and speak incessantly of "benevolence." But what are they really like? Look at the dirty tricks they hide behind their robes: The exhibits in the exhibition hall, including mortars, hand grenades, guns, bayonets, murder plans, anti-communist propaganda, radio transceivers, meteorological instruments, intelligence drafts, codebooks and other physical evidence and pictures of crimes, as well as the confessions of these imperialist spies and special agents who have been exposed and surrendered to the Chinese people, make us more clearly recognize the aggressive face of imperialism and increase our hatred for imperialism a hundredfold! After seeing the exhibition, we deeply remember once again what Chairman Mao told us at the beginning of the founding of New China: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore [their rule] in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must not relax our vigilance."
    The facts are exactly like this. In the exhibition, we can see that after liberation, Catholic priests Tian Wanglin and Lin Ren (Belgian), who were lurking in the Taishan Apartment in Shanghai to carry out espionage activities, set up a small chapel in the apartment, placed statues of saints, crosses, white candles, and flowers, seemingly a truly "holy" place. But in reality? They installed peepholes and signal lights on the door, and added three locks. Hiding stealthily in the house, they frequently sent various intelligence gathered from all sources to foreign imperialist spy agencies using secret writing and codes. These "enthusiastic" "missionaries" had a small booklet of the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Shanghai Diocese printed with an image of the Virgin Mary, which was actually their code base for carrying out their criminal activities.
    In the exhibition, we can also see the same thing: Ge Lugao, acting bishop of the Catholic Shaanxi General Church, and priest Bian Jining (Italian), had established relations with American spy organizations since 1944; after the liberation of Xi'an, they still privately set up radio stations to detect and collect various intelligence about China's politics, military affairs, and economy, and supplied it to imperialism. They secretly hid weapons, attempted to carry out armed sabotage, and used the Catholic Church to harbor Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents such as Wang Yaoxian, deputy captain and captain of the reconnaissance brigade of the pseudo-Xi'an Municipal Police Bureau. In order to carry out the criminal act of transmitting intelligence, they installed the antenna iron pipe of the radio transceiver, and this antenna iron pipe was hidden on the wall behind the hanging statue of Jesus!
    The exhibition forcefully revealed that these imperialist elements hidden within the Chinese Catholic Church have consistently colluded with domestic and foreign reactionaries, using the church as an instrument of aggression to carry out criminal activities that endanger the Chinese people. Pu Dengbo, bishop of the Catholic Lanzhou Diocese, and priest Zhao Chengming (German), who had long served as spies for the German, Japanese and French fascists and the United States, were awarded the "Iron Cross" by the fascist demon Hitler and a bayonet engraved with "Be faithful in times of crisis." They read Hitler's "Mein Kampf" and often hung the image of this fascist demon in their rooms. They confessed that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, when Japanese planes bombed Lanzhou, they hung the ugly swastika flag to indicate the bombing targets for their "allied" planes. Li Lujia, archbishop of the Taiyuan Diocese, who had participated in the Italian fascist death squad, actively helped the Japanese devils collect intelligence on the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan; after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he colluded with the Yan Xishan bandit gang to oppose communism and the people; after liberation, he still hid weapons and conspired to continue carrying out reactionary activities. Tai Yiqiu (American), bishop of the Catholic Canadian Jesuit Xuzhou Diocese, shamelessly invited Japanese devils and traitors to the church to promote the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" after Xuzhou fell, ordered church members to attend lectures, and personally went on stage to promote reactionary fallacies such as "Sino-Japanese friendship" and "Royal Road Paradise" for the Japanese devils. From the photos, we can see that this "missionary," who has always touted "transcendence of politics," once smiled and took photos with Japanese devil officers wearing sabers, traitor Hao Pengju, the Kuomintang pseudo-Xuzhou mayor, and the Kuomintang pseudo-Jiangsu Province Ninth Administrative Office Commissioner at different times. When he was promoted to bishop and held the inauguration ceremony, war criminals Gu Zhutong, Yu Bin, and others personally came to congratulate him. In December 1951, when the Xuzhou Military Control Commission ordered the arrest of this hypocritical imperialist spy, more than 200 pieces of radio transceivers, measuring instruments, and various important military telephone equipment, as well as some intelligence manuscripts and reactionary documents, were seized on the spot. Tai Yiqiu's true face of engaging in "preaching" was thus fully exposed.
    The exhibition revealed in detail the crimes of the American spy O'Kulan (Canadian) case uncovered in western Hunan. From the photos, we can see that this Catholic Bishop of Yuanling Diocese in Hunan Province once sat intimately with the big butcher Chiang Kai-shek for talks. In the summer of 1947, just as the People's Liberation Army turned from defense to offense, this "bishop" hurriedly flew to Peiping to report the situation in western Hunan to General Wedemeyer, the "special envoy" sent by the Truman government to China to help Chiang Kai-shek save his fate from defeat, and the Peiping branch of the US intelligence agency, and discuss plans for carrying out conspiracy activities after liberation. O'Kulan confessed: "They informed me of the intention of the United States government to help the Kuomintang defeat communism, and discussed with me how to implement our plan if communism was victorious." After the liberation of Hunan, O'Kulan and priests Wu Pingyu, Wei Zhongyong, and Hui Zemin (all three of whom were Americans) accepted instructions to "all stay behind." They used various methods to collect information about China's military, political, economic, and cultural affairs and the activities of reactionary armed forces, and transmitted them to foreign imperialism, totaling about 594 pieces. They also colluded with the special agents and bandits in western Hunan, and sent Jia Wei (American), a priest from the Yuanling Diocese, to Woxi, Liulin, and other places, using Easter as a cover to collude with bandit Hu Zhiqiu, commander of the Hunan People's Salvation Army, Hu Dawu, captain of the anti-communist Ninth Route Army, and Song Guanrong, commander-in-chief of the bandit Xiangxi People's Salvation Army (all of whom have been brought to justice), providing them with money, weapons, food, medicine, and plotting armed riots to subvert the people's regime. This imperialist spy and special agent in religious garb confessed: "In order to hinder the liberation movement in western Hunan, I sympathized with the bandits in western Hunan and encouraged them," "The Yuanling Diocese and the bandits united to form a strong 'alliance of friendship'. They had a common enemy, and they all had the same hope of driving the Liberation Army out of western Hunan. We praised the bandits as friends of the church, as true patriots of China," "We were hoping that these people would suppress communism, so when they were completely suppressed, I was very disappointed!"
    These imperialist elements lurking in the Catholic Church have always been enemies of the Chinese people. They not only engage in intelligence and espionage activities, but also openly organize armed riots, vainly attempting to assassinate our people's leaders. The exhibition revealed the various criminal activities of the "Catholic Youth Patriotic League," which was a huge armed secret service organization within the Catholic Church personally planned and established by the imperialist spy Lei Zhenyuan and Chiang Kai-shek bandit Dai Li. This reactionary armed secret service organization was based on reactionary clergy in Catholic churches throughout North China, and used Catholic churches throughout North China as cover to conduct activities in vast towns and villages. During the Liberation War in July 1947, Luo Guanzhi (Dutch priest), an imperialist element lurking in the Catholic Church in Shijiazhuang, colluded with Chen Qiming, bishop of the Catholic Zhengding Diocese, Yang Hongzhi, director of guidance, and priest Chen Daosheng, and others to collude with the reactionary landlord return team to harass Zhengding County; during more than 20 days, they burned, killed, looted, and did everything, killing more than 300 cadres and masses. The exhibition also revealed, with various concrete evidences, the conspiracy activities of this reactionary secret service organization in 1948 to explore in every way the whereabouts of our military and government leaders in Pingshan County, Hebei Province. They exchanged letters and telegrams to arrange assassins to assassinate and indicate bombing targets for Chiang Kai-shek's planes. They vainly attempted to kill our people's leaders, and in order to prevent this conspiracy from being exposed, they also brutally hunted down and killed two patriotic Catholics. This extremely heinous Pingshan conspiracy case was not realized due to the strict precautions taken by the People's Government of our liberated area and the broad masses. However, the imperialists did not give up. Two years later, the People's Government uncovered the case of the American spy Li Andong and others conspiring to bombard Tiananmen Square, once again exposing their sinister ambitions. Among those involved in this criminal plan was Madi Nuo, who had served as the bishop of the Catholic Yixian Diocese in Hebei Province and the "Beijing representative" of Libere, the former "Papal Nuncio to China." This imperialist spy in religious garb, along with Li Andong, Yamaguchi Ryuichi, and others, were all under the command of Colonel Baudette, the military attaché of the former US Embassy's military attaché office in Peiping. Madi Nuo also hid some of the murder weapons in the former "Beijing Office of the Papal Nuncio to China" at No. 6 Naizifu in Beijing. Now, this criminal plan, the sketch of the bombing of Tiananmen Square, and the mortar and other murder weapons are all openly displayed in the exhibition hall. We recognize that these "missionaries" in robes are actually wolves in sheep's clothing.
    These imperialist elements lurking in the Catholic Church also cruelly murdered countless children and infants in our country under the cover of running "charitable undertakings." The exhibition displayed the truth about the charitable undertakings run by imperialism that have been revealed in Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Wuhu, Wuchang, Jiaxing, Taiyuan, and other places. When we see in the photos those emaciated, dying, and abused children like skeletons, see those dark "cellars," "dry wells," and "wells for dead babies" where infants were murdered, and piles of white bones, and then look back at the pictures of those imperialist elements living in well-lit foreign buildings, eating ham, cream, milk, and coffee, can you not feel deep grief and extreme hatred from the bottom of your heart? Imperialism calls murder "saving souls." Let us listen to the confession of Ai Yuandao and Guo Shiji (American), persons in charge of the Catholic Wuchang Diocese, in their report to the United States regarding the situation of the Wuchang Garden Mountain Nursery: "Since its establishment, it has harvested a soul crop that has continued to increase, and has established a record that has become the glory and joy of the church. … All year round, every day without exception, the people in the church collect fruits - saving souls. The total number rises sharply every day, reaching an amazing and gratifying level. … About 90 percent of the infants received by this church die immediately after being baptized." Thinking of these innocent children, standing in front of the photo of the Ten Thousand Infant Cemetery built for them by people from all walks of life in Wuhan, every conscientious person will have unparalleled hatred for inhuman imperialism. Let us always remember these countless small lives who were harmed by imperialism. For the sake of the happiness of countless children living happily in the sun today, we must never stand idly by outside the struggle.
    Anti-imperialist patriotism is the responsibility of every people, and it is also the responsibility of every Catholic. From the exhibition, we see that in the past, patriotic Catholic Mr. Ma Xiangbo and Professor Song Guobin and others had launched unyielding struggles against the imperialist elements within the church. After liberation, Catholics across the country stood up even more courageously, angrily exposing the various crimes of imperialism using religion to carry out aggression and oppress the Chinese people. Many patriotic Chinese bishops, priests, and nuns also participated in this just anti-imperialist struggle. The just actions of patriotic Catholics have received widespread support and solidarity from people from all walks of life. The policy of the People's Government is to resolutely crack down on the conspiracy of imperialism to use religion to carry out aggressive activities, and to legally guarantee the freedom of religious belief of the Chinese people. These clauses are recorded in the Common Program, and the pictures displayed in the exhibition also specifically explain these principles. We see that the imperialist element Libere and others have been deported by the People's Government, while patriotic Catholics in various places are freely carrying out their own religious activities in churches.
    The exhibition helped us to more clearly recognize the hideous face of imperialism using Catholicism to carry out sabotage activities. After seeing the exhibition, let each of us think about the situation of the volunteer soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines to protect the security of the motherland, and look at the warm atmosphere of the people across the country working diligently and selflessly to build the great motherland in their respective posts. Can we still tolerate imperialist spies and special agents carrying out sabotage on the land of our new China and undermining our peaceful construction? Let us all unite closely, whether believers or non-believers, under the leadership of the People's Government, actively participate in the struggle to eliminate imperialist elements and other counter-revolutionary elements within the Catholic Church, and completely smash the conspiracy of imperialism to use religion to carry out sabotage activities.

    血腥的罪证
    介绍上海市“帝国主义利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动罪证展览会”
    屠培林
    参观“帝国主义利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动罪证展览会”，对我们每个人都是一次有益的深刻的反帝爱国教育。许多由外国派遣来华、分布各地的“传教士”，表面上道貌岸然，满口“仁爱”，实际上呢？看一看他们隐藏在道袍后面的鬼把戏吧：展览会场里陈列的迫击炮、手榴弹、枪械、刺刀、谋杀计划、反共宣传品、无线电收发报机、气象测量仪器、情报稿子、密码本子等罪证实物和图片，以及这些帝国主义间谍特务分子在被揭穿假面具后向中国人民俯首招供的自白书，使我们更清楚地认识了帝国主义的侵略面目，百倍地增加了我们对帝国主义的仇恨！看过展览会，使我们深切地又一次记起毛主席在新中国成立之初就对我们说过的话：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    事实正是这样。在展览会里我们可以看到：解放后潜伏在上海市泰山公寓进行间谍特务活动的天主教神甫田望霖、林仁（比利时籍），他们在寓所布置了一所小圣堂，摆上圣像、十字架，供奉白烛，鲜花，俨然真是个“圣洁”的地方。实际呢？他们在大门上安装了警眼、暗号灯，还加上三把锁，鬼鬼祟祟地躲在屋里，经常把从各方面刺探搜集来的各种情报，用密写药水和密码向国外帝国主义间谍特务机构递送。这些“热心”的“传教士”有一本印着圣母像的天主教上海教区的瞻礼单小册子，原来是他们进行罪恶活动的密码底本。
    在展览会里，我们还可以看到同样的事情：天主教陕西总堂代理主教葛露膏和神甫边寄宁（意大利籍），从一九四四年起就和美国间谍组织建立了关系；在西安解放后仍私设电台，刺探搜集有关我国政治、军事、经济等各种情报，供给帝国主义。他们密藏武器，企图进行武装破坏，并利用天主教堂窝藏了伪西安市警察局侦缉大队副、大队长王耀先等蒋匪特务罪犯。他们为了进行传递情报的罪恶勾当，装置了无线电收发报机的天线铁管，而这一天线铁管就隐蔽在悬挂耶稣圣像的背面墙上！
    展览会有力地揭露了：这些隐藏在中国天主教会内的帝国主义分子，一贯和国内外反动派相勾结，利用教会作为侵略工具，进行危害中国人民的罪恶活动。历充德、日法西斯和美国间谍的天主教兰州教区主教濮登博、神甫赵承明（德国籍）等，就曾得到法西斯魔王希特勒奖给他们的“铁十字勋章”和刻着“在危急中要忠信”的刺刀。他们阅读希特勒的“我的奋斗”，把这个法西斯魔王的像经常挂在房里。他们自己招认：在抗战时期当日寇飞机轰炸兰州时，他们曾挂起丑恶的卐字旗，给他们的“盟国”飞机指示轰炸目标。曾参加过意大利法西斯敢死队的太原教区总主教李露嘉，在抗战期中积极帮助日寇搜集八路军情报；抗战胜利后，又和阎匪锡山勾结反共反人民；解放后，仍旧隐藏武器，阴谋继续进行反动活动。天主教加拿大耶稣会徐州教区主教邰轶欧（美国籍），在徐州沦陷后，曾无耻地邀请日寇、汉奸到教堂宣传“大东亚共荣圈”，命令教友都参加听讲，他自己还亲自登台替日寇宣扬
    “中日亲善”、“皇道乐土”等反动谬论。从照片上我们可以看到，这个素来标榜“超政治”的“传教士”，在各个不同时期，曾经笑容满面地分别和佩着军刀的日寇军官、汉奸郝鹏举、国民党伪徐州市长、国民党伪江苏省第九行署专员等一起合影。在他升任主教举行就职典礼时，战犯顾祝同、于斌等都亲自赶来祝贺。一九五一年十二月，徐州市军管会下令逮捕这个伪善的帝国主义间谍分子时，当场抄获了收发报机、测量仪器、各种重要军用电话器材等二百余件和一部分情报底稿及反动文件。邰轶欧进行“传教”的真面目就这样全部暴露了。
    展览会详尽地揭露了在湘西破获的美国间谍欧克澜（加拿大籍）案的罪行。从照片上可以看见，这位天主教湖南沅陵教区主教，曾和大刽子手蒋介石亲切地在一起并坐会谈。一九四七年夏天，正当人民解放军由防御转入进攻时，这位“主教”匆匆忙忙地飞到了北平，向杜鲁门政府派遣来中国帮助蒋介石挽救失败命运的“特使”魏德迈和美国间谍机关北平支部汇报湘西情况，商讨解放后进行阴谋活动的计划。欧克澜供认：“他们告知我美国政府帮助国民党击退共产主义的意向，并和我讨论过共产主义如果胜利了时，如何实行我们的计划。”湖南解放后，欧克澜和神甫武平舆、韦中庸、惠泽民（以上三人都是美国籍）等接受指示“全部留下”。他们利用各种方法收集有关我国军事、政治、经济、文化的情报和反动武装活动的情况，转递给外国帝国主义，总数约五百九十四件。他们还勾结湘西特务土匪武装，派遣沅陵教区神甫贾威（美国籍）赴沃溪、柳林等处，以过复活节为掩护，勾结匪湖南人民救国军军长胡芝邱、反共九路军大队长胡大武、匪湘西人民救国军总司令宋官荣等（均已伏法），资助他们金钱、武器、粮食、医药，阴谋武装暴动，颠覆人民政权。这个披着宗教外衣的帝国主义间谍特务供认：“为了阻碍湘西的解放运动，我同情湘西的土匪，并鼓励他们”，“沅陵教区与土匪们团结起来形成了一个坚强的‘友谊联盟’，他们有个共同的敌人，他们都怀着把解放军从湘西赶出去的同
    一希望。我们推崇土匪为教会的朋友，是中国的真正爱国者”，“我们期望着这些人压迫共产主义，所以当他们被彻底镇压了时，我非常失望！”
    这些潜伏在天主教会内的帝国主义分子，从来就是和中国人民为敌的，他们不仅进行情报间谍活动，还公然组织武装暴乱，妄图谋刺我人民领袖。展览会揭露了“公教青年报国团”的各种罪恶活动，它是由帝国主义间谍雷振远和蒋匪帮戴笠亲自策划成立的天主教内的庞大的武装特务组织。这个反动武装特务组织以华北各地天主教内的反动神职人员
    为基础，以华北各地天主堂为掩护，深入广大城镇乡
    村进行活动。一九四七年七月解放战争期间，该团潜伏在石家庄天主堂内帝国主义分子罗贯之（荷兰籍神甫），和天主教正定教区主教陈启明、指导司铎杨鸿志、神甫陈道生等一起，曾经勾结反动地主还乡队，乘虚侵扰我正定县；在二十多天中烧杀抢掠，无所不为，杀害了干部和群众共三百多人。展览会并以各种实证，有力地揭露了一九四八年间这个反动特务组织多方刺探我军政首长在河北平山县一带的住地的阴谋活动，他们函电往返，布置凶手谋刺和为蒋匪飞机指示轰炸目标。他们妄想杀害我人民领袖，而且为了防止这一阴谋暴露出去，还凶残地捕杀了两名爱国天主教徒。这一罪大恶极的平山阴谋案，终因我解放区人民政府及广大群众严密防范，而没有实现。但是帝国主义并没有死心，人民政府在两年以后又破获了美国特务间谍李安东等阴谋炮轰天安门的案件，再一次暴露了他们的凶恶野心。参与这个罪恶计划的有曾任天主教河北易县教区主教和前“罗马教廷驻华公使”黎培里的“北京代表”马迪懦。这个披着宗教外衣的帝国主义间谍和李安东、山口隆一等，都接受前美国大使馆驻北平武官处上校武官包瑞德的指挥，马迪懦并把一部分杀人武器隐藏在北京乃兹府六号前“教廷驻华公使馆北平办事处”内。现在，这一罪恶计划，炮轰天安门的草图和迫击炮等杀人武器，都公开陈列在展览会场里了。我们认清了这些穿着道袍的“传教士”，原来是披着羊皮的狼。
    这些潜伏在天主教内的帝国主义分子，还以举办
    “慈善事业”为掩护，残酷地虐杀了我国无数的孩子和婴儿。展览会陈列了北京、南京、广州、天津、芜湖、武昌、嘉兴、太原等地已经揭发出来的帝国主义所办慈善事业的真相。当我们从照片上看到那些皮包骨头、奄奄一息、被作践得像骷髅一样的孩子们，看到那些虐杀婴孩的阴暗的“地窖”、
    “枯井”、“死仔井”和成堆的白骨，再回头看看图片上那些帝国主义分子却住着光线充足的洋楼，吃着火腿、奶油、牛奶、咖啡，你能不从心底里感到深切的悲痛和极端的仇恨吗？帝国主义把杀人说成“拯救灵魂”。让我们听一听天主教武昌教区负责人艾原道、郭时济（美国籍）在寄回美国的报告中有关武昌花园山育婴堂情况的自白：“从开办以来，它已经采集了一种有增无已的灵魂的收获，并建立了一种记录，成为教会的光荣和愉快。……一年到头，每天没有例外地，堂里的人收集果实——拯救灵魂，总数每天急剧上升，达到令人惊异和欣慰的地步。……这个堂所收容的婴儿，约有百分之九十在受洗礼后立刻死掉了。”想起这些无辜的孩子，站立在武汉市各界人民为他们建筑的万婴墓照片前，我们每个有良心的人，都会对毫无人性的帝国主义产生无比的仇恨。让我们永远记念着这些被帝国主义残害的无数小生命吧，为了今天在阳光下欢乐地生活着的无数孩子们的幸福，我们是绝不能站在斗争之外袖手旁观的。
    反帝爱国是每一个人民的责任，也是每一个天主教徒的责任。从展览会里，我们看到：在过去，爱国天主教徒马相伯老先生和宋国宾教授等，就曾经和教会内的帝国主义分子展开了不屈不挠的斗争。解放后，全国各地天主教徒更纷纷勇敢地站起来，愤怒地揭发了帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略和压迫中国人民的种种罪行。许多爱国的中国主教、神甫和修女等，也参加了这一正义的反帝斗争。爱国天主教徒的正义行动，得到了各界人民的广泛支持与声援。人民政府的政策是：对于帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略活动的阴谋坚决予以打击，对于中国人民的宗教信仰自由则依法予以保障。共同纲领上记载着这些条文，展览会陈列的图片中也具体地说明了这些道理。我们看到：帝国主义分子黎培里等已被人民政府驱逐出境，而各地的爱国天主教徒，则在教堂里自由地进行着他们自己的宗教活动。
    展览会帮助我们更清楚地认识了帝国主义利用天主教进行破坏活动的狰狞面目。看罢展览会，我们每个人想一想志愿军战士正在前线浴血奋战保卫着祖国安全的情形，看一看全国人民正在各自的岗位上辛勤劳动，忘我地建设着伟大祖国的热烈气象，我们难道还能容忍帝国主义间谍特务分子在我们新中国的土地上进行捣乱，破坏我们的和平建设吗？让我们大家紧密地团结起来，不管是教徒与非教徒，在人民政府的领导下，积极地参加清除天主教内帝国主义分子及其他反革命分子的斗争，彻底粉碎帝国主义利用宗教进行破坏活动的阴谋。
