    A Model Rural Party Branch Secretary - Gou Peifang
    Wang Piyu Geng Xi
    Gou Peifang is an outstanding village Party branch secretary. The Quzhai Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, which he leads, has transformed from a backward branch to an advanced branch in the past three years. The transformation process of this branch demonstrates Gou Peifang's loyalty to the cause of the Party and his leadership abilities.
    Gou Peifang was born into a blacksmith's family and followed his father to learn the craft from a young age. In 1937, Japanese imperialism occupied Changzhi County, and Gou Peifang lost his job. He said, "If we don't drive away the Japanese devils, we won't be able to live." That year, he joined the anti-Japanese Eighth Route Army. Through the Party's education and training and the tempering of revolutionary military life, his class consciousness gradually increased. He gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1940.
    In the army, Gou Peifang was a brave and skilled soldier who repeatedly performed meritorious deeds. In 1947, he was discharged and returned to his hometown due to a leg injury. When he returned to his hometown, Quzhai, the village work was still very backward, most of the party members were negative and tired, and did not do their work. Sometimes, even the branch meeting could not be convened. Gou Peifang felt very strange. He thought: In the army, all work is led by party members, why are the communist party members in our village different? Where is the problem? After a period of investigation and research, Gou Peifang found that most party members had the idea of "revolution is successful and should rest" after the completion of the land reform, thinking that "the Japanese have been driven away, the landlords have been overthrown, life has also improved, the revolution has been successful, and we should take a rest," and thus, everyone was busy developing their personal affairs, and regarded the party's work as an "extra burden." Gou Peifang saw the seriousness of the problem. He thought: If this problem is not solved, the revolution cannot continue to move forward. Gou Peifang, who had lived in the army for a long time, was unfamiliar with leading rural work. But he understood: "The production front is the same as the military front. It is necessary to improve the political awareness of the communist party members and give full play to their enthusiasm in order to mobilize the masses and win the victory." So he put forward his own views to the branch committee. He said: "In the army, the Party often conducts political and ideological education for party members, so the enthusiasm of party members is very high, and they are very brave in fighting. If we want to do a good job in our village, the branch must strengthen the political and ideological education of the party members." The branch committee thought that Gou Peifang's opinion was correct, and immediately made a resolution to strengthen the educational work of the branch, and entrusted Gou Peifang to serve as the branch instructor.
    In January 1950, the Quzhai branch officially held a training class for party members. According to "Party Member Textbook," "Constitution of the Communist Party of China," and "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members" and other documents, and combined with the specific problems existing among party members, Gou Peifang used the methods of lectures and discussions to educate party members on how to be a communist party member, so that party members recognized the long-term prospects of communism and the struggle goals of party members. Thus, he overcame the idea of "revolution is successful and should rest," and the political enthusiasm of party members was greatly improved. Many party members made self-criticism in their studies. Those who used to think that the revolution was successful after being assigned land now understood: It turns out that seizing power is only the first step of a long march. Some party members criticized their narrow peasant consciousness, and some reviewed their mistakes of being negative and tired. For example, Wang Jianqin said: "In the past, I did not explain the Party's policies to the masses, nor did I reflect the opinions and requirements of the masses to the Party. I was simply wearing the title of a communist party member in vain." In addition to giving party lectures, Gou Peifang also often paid attention to understanding the ideological situation of party members, and conducted education separately to solve the ideological problems of party members. Therefore, some people with individualism often received the Party's education. After the end of the training class, Gou Peifang put forward the issue of establishing a regular education system to the branch. After the branch committee's research and unanimous approval by all party members, it was stipulated that the first, eleventh, and twenty-first of each month would be "Party Member Study Days." In the "Party Member Study Days," the main focus was on studying the Party's policies, and solving the main problems existing among party members in various periods, such as: the idea of revolutionary success, sectarian emotions, and capitalist tendencies, in a timely manner. This greatly improved the ideological awareness of party members and promoted the progress of work.
    In the ideological education work for party members, Gou Peifang especially emphasized the importance of carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the Party. In the past, the democratic life of the Quzhai branch was very unsound. Gou Peifang had thought of many ways to change this situation, but none of them had achieved much effect. Once, he took the lead in making a self-criticism at the branch meeting to encourage everyone to carry out criticism and self-criticism; but after everyone listened to his self-criticism, they just looked at each other and no one was willing to speak. Later, he used the method of criticizing others while reviewing himself to guide everyone, but unexpectedly, the person who was criticized felt a little unbearable.
    Why can't criticism between party members always be carried out? Gou Peifang finally found the reason in actual life. The main reason is that the level of awareness is not high, and even many party members do not know what criticism and self-criticism are all about. Gou Peifang realized that: if we do not actively improve the political awareness of party members and simply focus on minor aspects, criticism and self-criticism will not be carried out. So Gou Peifang explained to the party members the purpose and significance of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and he especially quoted what Chairman Mao said and repeatedly explained it to everyone. Chairman Mao said: "The house should be cleaned regularly, and if it is not cleaned, it will be covered with dust; the face should be washed regularly, and if it is not washed, it will be covered with dust. The thoughts of our comrades and the work of our Party will also be stained with dust, and they should also be cleaned and washed." Everyone studied and discussed these words of Chairman Mao, and had some preliminary understanding of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, but there were still many concerns. At a branch meeting, Qu Wenze criticized Qu Chunhong for planting on public roads, and Qu Chunhong immediately retorted. Other party members saw that the "fire" was not right, and no one dared to make a suggestion. At this time, Gou Peifang immediately criticized Qu Chunhong, and through this example, corrected the incorrect attitude of party members towards criticism and self-criticism. He said to everyone: "The attitude towards criticism and self-criticism is the measure of the degree of awareness of each party member. We communist party members serve the people wholeheartedly. Why are we reluctant to give up some personal mistakes and shortcomings?" From then on, criticism and self-criticism among party members of the Quzhai branch gradually unfolded. For example, party member Gu Huaishan (who was the village chief at the time) did not work well, and often used the excuse of being busy with work to not attend branch meetings, and others did not dare to openly make suggestions to him. Since studying criticism and self-criticism, everyone has broken down sentiments and criticized Gu Huaishan. Party member Yang Yingtang criticized him and said, "Huaishan, you are a communist party member, and communist party members must work actively. If you only enjoy the glorious title of communist party member and do not work actively, then you are not worthy of being a communist party member." At this time, others also expressed their opinions. After this intense ideological struggle, Gu Huaishan received a relatively profound education, actively corrected his mistakes, and improved his work. Now he has served as the organization member of the branch.
    The biggest feature of Gou Peifang's ideological education work for party members is that he can closely integrate it with current work. In the early part of 1950, many party members did not understand the important significance of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and were unwilling to participate in mutual aid groups. This seriously affected the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    Based on this situation, Gou Peifang, according to the instructions of the higher-level Party, led
    the branch to carry out the struggle against right-leaning thought. Gou Peifang remembered Chairman Mao
    once said in the article "Get Organized": "In terms of the peasant masses,
    for thousands of years, they have been individual economies. Each household is a
    production unit. This decentralized individual production is the economic
    foundation of feudal rule, which makes the peasants themselves fall into permanent poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives." According to these words of Chairman Mao, Gou Peifang, in connection with the class differentiation that had already occurred in this village, repeatedly explained that mutual aid and cooperation is the fundamental direction of rural economic development, and that communist party members have the responsibility to lead the masses to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, so that peasants can fundamentally get rid of poverty. After this education, twenty-eight out of thirty-two party members participated in the mutual aid group. The idea that some party members had fantasized about maintaining a "well-off family" forever began to change. Then, extensive publicity was launched among the masses. Under the influence of the communist party members' active publicity and taking the lead, 80% of the farmers in the village participated in the mutual aid group.
    Most of the party members participated in the mutual aid group, but they lacked a real understanding of the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policy. Some engaged in large-scale commercial activities in the mutual aid group, some planned to sell the newly assigned houses and land to engage in sideline production, and even a few party members planned to hire long-term workers. These situations show that capitalist ideas in party members are growing and rising again. Gou Peifang understood that ideological education is a long-term and arduous task, and the backward remnants in people's minds cannot be completely eliminated by one education. Therefore, the struggle against right-leaning thought must continue. In the spring of 1952, Gou Peifang, according to the deployment of the higher-level Party, organized all party members to study Comrade Gao Gang's report "Overcoming the Erosion of the Party by Bourgeois Thought and Opposing Right-Leaning Thought in the Party," in the section "On the Direction of Rural Economic Development"; many party members consciously checked themselves through study, and the right-leaning thought within the Party was severely criticized. Party member Gou Faxing originally planned to sell the building to engage in commercial activities. After studying, he immediately dismissed the idea and decided to lead the peasants to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Later, the mutual aid group he led and the mutual aid group led by Che Chunlan merged to form a production cooperative, setting an example for the masses to take the road to collectivization.
    While carrying out education on the direction of rural economic development, Gou Peifang attached great importance to the political and ideological leadership of the peasant masses, educating the peasants to overcome the conservative idea of "production reaching the top." For example, Gou Faxing's mutual aid group
    In 1951, the production achievements exceeded more than double before the Anti-Japanese War, and later developed into an agricultural production cooperative. When formulating the 1952 production increase plan, many cooperative members believed that production had reached the top and could not be increased any further, and other mutual aid groups had similar situations. Old farmer Jia Yinggui said: "It is difficult to harvest 100 dan of grain if you don't plant 100 mu of land. I have lived for 60 years, and I have never seen a mu of land that can harvest 1,200 to 1,800 jin of grain." After discovering this situation, Gou Peifang persuaded everyone on the one hand by improving production technology and giving full play to the potential power of agricultural production, and on the other hand, he used things familiar to the peasants, such as telling the abundant production stories of labor heroes such as Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en, to increase their confidence in agricultural abundance. However, even so, the ideological problems of some peasant masses could not be completely solved. It was not until the autumn of 1952 that Gou Faxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, after a year of careful cultivation by all cooperative members, harvested 935 jin per mu of abundant grain land. On the day of threshing, the branch organized the masses of the whole village to visit, and Gou Faxing introduced their abundant production experience to the masses of the whole village. At this time, the farmers' thinking of increasing production was completely resolved, and they further realized the superiority of being organized. They said: "Working alone is not as good as mutual aid, the cooperative is higher than the team, and if you want a more beautiful life, the collective farm is the goal." These words vividly illustrate the success of the Quzhai branch in carrying out rural development direction education under the leadership of Gou Peifang.
    Under the help of the higher-level Party and the leadership of the village branch, through the active efforts of party members and the masses of the whole village, Quzhai Village has changed from a backward village to an advanced village. Branch secretary Gou Peifang is loved and trusted by the broad masses. In the past three years, he has successively won awards from party and government leading organs at the provincial, county, and district levels. In October 1952, at the county-wide labor model meeting, he was also elected as a special model cadre at the village level in the county. Gou Peifang's understanding of these honors is objective. He said: "These honors should first be attributed to the Party and to the people of the whole village. Without the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committee and the active efforts of all party members and the masses of the whole village, it would not have been possible to achieve such results by relying on my own strength alone."

### 一个模范的农村党支部书记——苟佩芳

    一个模范的农村党支部书记——苟佩芳
    王丕玉  耕溪
    苟佩芳是党的一个出色的村支部书记。他所领导的中共山西长治县璩寨村支部，三年来，已由一个落后的支部转变为今天的先进支部。从这个支部的转变过程，表现出了苟佩芳对党的事业的忠诚和他的领导才能。
    苟佩芳出身于一个铁匠的家庭，从小便跟着父亲在外学手艺。一九三七年，日本帝国主义侵占了长治县，苟佩芳失业了。他说：“不打走日本鬼子，就没法生活。”当年他便参加了抗日的八路军。经过党的教育培养和革命的军事生活锻炼，他的阶级觉悟逐渐提高。一九四零年光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    在部队里，苟佩芳是一个英勇善战的战士，屡立战功。一九四七年，因腿部负伤，才退伍还乡。当他回到自己的家乡——璩寨的时候，村里的工作还非常落后，多数党员消极疲沓，不做工作，有时甚至连支部会都召集不起来。苟佩芳觉得很奇怪，他想：在部队里一切工作都是党员带头，为什么咱村里的共产党员却偏偏两样呢？问题在那里呢？苟佩芳经过了一番调查研究，发现大多数党员在土地改革完成以后，产生了“革命成功应该休息”的思想，认为“日本赶走了，地主打倒了，生活也改善了，革命已经胜利了，应该休息休息了”，因而，大家终日忙于发展个人的家务，把党的工作看成是“额外负担”。苟佩芳看到了问题的严重性。他想：如果不解决这个问题，革命就不能继续前进。长期在部队生活过的苟佩芳，对领导农村工作是生疏的。但是他懂得：“生产战线和军事战线是一样，必须提高共产党员的政治觉悟，发挥共产党员的积极性，才能把广大群众发动起来，获得胜利。”于是他向支部委员会提出了自己的意见。他说：“在部队里，党经常向党员进行政治思想教育，因此党员的积极性都很高，打起仗来很勇敢。要想把咱们村的工作搞好，支部必须加强对党员的政治思想教育。”支委会认为苟佩芳的意见很对，立即作了加强支部教育工作的决议，并委托苟佩芳担任支部教员。
    一九五○年一月，璩寨支部正式举办了党员训练班。苟佩芳根据“党员课本”、“中国共产党党章”和“论共产党员的修养”等文件，并结合党员中存在的具体问题，采用讲授和讨论的方法，对党员进行了怎样做一个共产党员的教育，使党员认识了共产主义的远大前途和党员的奋斗目标。从而克服了“革命成功应该休息”的思想，党员的政治积极性也就大大提高了。许多党员在学习中都纷纷作了自我检查。过去以为分到土地就算革命成功的人，现在才懂得了：原来夺取政权，只是万里长征第一步。有的党员就批判了自己的狭隘的农民意识，有的检讨了消极疲沓的错误。如王建琴说：“过去我不向群众解释党的政策，也不向党反映群众的意见和要求，简直是空挂了个共产党员的称号了。”苟佩芳除讲党课以外，还经常注意了解党员的思想情况，分别进行教育，解决党员的思想问题。因此，某些带有个人主义的人也就经常受到了党的教育。训练班结束后，苟佩芳向支部提出了建立经常性的教育制度问题，经支委会研究和全体党员一致通过后，规定每月初一、十一、二十一为“党员学习日”。在“党员学习日”里，主要是学习党的政策，针对党员在各个时期所存在的主要问题，如：革命成功思想、宗派情绪，以及资本主义思想等倾向，及时进行解决。这就大大提高了党员的思想觉悟，推动了工作前进。
    苟佩芳在对党员进行思想教育的工作中，特别强调在党内开展批评和自我批评的重要。在以前，璩寨支部的民主生活是很不健全的，苟佩芳曾想过许多办法来改变这种状况，都没有获得多大的效果。有一次，他在支部大会上带头检讨，启发大家开展批评和自我批评；但是大家听了他的检讨以后，只是你看我、我看你，谁也不肯作声。后来他又用检讨自己同时又批评别人的办法去引导大家，不料，那个被批评的人就感觉到有点受不住。
    党员之间的批评为什么老是展不开呢？苟佩芳在实际生活中终于找到了原因。主要是觉悟程度不高，甚至有许多党员就不知道批评和自我批评是怎么一回事。苟佩芳认识到：如果不积极地去提高党员的政治觉悟，单纯从枝节方面着眼，批评和自我批评是不会展开的。于是苟佩芳就给党员讲解开展批评和自我批评的目的和意义，他特别引用了毛主席所说的话，反复地给大家解释。毛主席说：“房子是应该经常打扫的，不打扫就会积满了灰尘；脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。我们同志的思想，我们党的工作，也会沾染灰尘的，也应该打扫和洗涤。”大家学习和讨论了毛主席的这些话，对开展批评和自我批评才有了一些初步的认识，但仍然存在着许多顾虑。在一次支部会议上，璩文则批评璩春红种的地占了公家的道路，马上被璩春红给碰了回来。别的党员看着“火色”不对，谁也不敢提意见了。这时苟佩芳立即批评了璩春红，并通过这一实例，端正了党员对待批评和自我批评的不正确态度。他对大家说：“对于批评和自我批评的态度，是测量每个党员觉悟程度的尺子，我们共产党员是全心全意为人民服务的，为什么个人的一些错误和缺点，还舍不得丢掉呢？”从此，璩寨支部党员之间的批评和自我批评就逐渐地展开了。比如，党员谷怀山（当时担任村长职务），不好好工作，还常常藉口工作忙而不参加支部会，别人也不敢公开地向他提意见。自从学习了批评和自我批评以后，大家才打破情面，向谷怀山进行了批评。党员杨英堂批评他说：“怀山，你是一个共产党员，共产党员就必须积极工作，如果你只享受共产党员的光荣称号而不积极工作，那就不配作一个共产党员。”这时，别人也都纷纷发表了意见。谷怀山经过这一场激烈的思想斗争，受到了比较深刻的教育，积极纠正错误、改进工作，如今他已担任了支部的组织委
    员。
    苟佩芳向党员进行思想教育工作的最大特点，是能密切结合当前工作进行。在一九五○年初，许多党员由于不了解互助合作运动的重要意义，都不愿参加互助组。严重地影响了互助合作运动的开展。
    依据这个情况，苟佩芳根据上级党的指示，领导
    支部开展了反右倾思想的斗争。苟佩芳记得毛主席
    在“组织起来”的一文中曾说过：“在农民群众方
    面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生
    产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经
    济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”苟佩芳根据毛主席的这些话，联系本村已经发生的阶级分化的情况，反复说明互助合作是农村经济发展的根本方向，共产党员有责任领导群众走互助合作的道路，使农民从根本上摆脱贫困。经过这些教育以后，三十二个党员中，有二十八个人参加了互助组。某些党员曾幻想永远保持“小康之家”的想法，就开始转变了。接着，又在群众中展开了广泛的宣传。在共产党员积极宣传并积极带头的影响下，全村有百分之八十的农户参加了互助组。
    大部分党员都参加了互助组，但是他们对党的互助合作政策还缺乏真正的认识。有的在互助组里大搞商业活动，有的计划卖掉刚分到的房屋和土地去搞副业生产，甚至还有个别的党员打算雇长工。这些情况说明在党员中的资本主义思想又在滋长和抬头。苟佩芳懂得了思想教育是一个长期艰苦的工作，人们思想中落后残余不是一次教育就可以完全消除的，因此，反右倾思想的斗争还必须继续进行。一九五二年春，苟佩芳又根据上级党的布置，组织全体党员学习了高岗同志“克服资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，反对党内的右倾思想”的报告中“关于农村经济发展的方向问题”的一段；许多党员都通过学习自觉地检查了自己，党内的右倾思想受到了严厉的批判。党员苟发兴原来打算卖掉楼房，去作商业活动，学习后，立刻打消了这个想法，决心领导农民走互助合作的道路。后来，他领导的互助组和车春兰领导的互助组合并组成了一个生产合作社，给群众做出了一个走向集体化道路的榜样。
    和贯彻农村经济发展方向教育的同时，苟佩芳极其重视对农民群众的政治思想的领导，教育农民克服“生产到顶”的保守思想。比如苟发兴互助组
    一九五一年的生产成绩超过抗日战争前的一倍多，后来发展成为农业生产合作社，当制订一九五二年的增产计划时，许多社员都认为生产已经到顶，不可能再提高了，其他互助组也都有类似情况。老农贾英贵就说：“不种百亩田，难打百石粮，我活了六十岁啦，就没见过有一亩地能打千二八百斤粮食的。”苟佩芳发现这个情况以后，便一面从提高生产技术，发挥农业生产上的潜在力量等来说服大家，一面用农民所熟知的事情，比如讲李顺达、郭玉恩等劳动英雄的丰产故事来提高他们对农业丰产的信心。虽然如此，但是仍不能彻底解决若干农民群众的思想问题。直到一九五二年秋天，苟发兴农业生产合作社，经过全体社员一年的精耕细作，丰产谷地每亩打了九百三十五斤。打场的那一天，支部组织全村群众前往参观，并由苟发兴向全村群众介绍了他们的丰产经验。这时，农民的增产思想才得到完全解决，进一步认识了组织起来的优越性。他们说：“单干不如互助好，社比小组更要高，生活要想更美满，集体农庄是目标。”这几句话就生动地说明了璩寨支部在苟佩芳的领导下，进行农村发展方向教育的成功。
    璩寨村在上级党的帮助和村支部的领导下，经过党员和全村群众的积极努力，由落后村变成了先进村。支部书记苟佩芳受到广大群众的热爱和信赖。三年来，他先后荣获过省、县、区各级党、政领导机关的奖励。一九五二年十月，他在全县的劳动模范会议上，又被选为全县村级的特等模范干部。苟佩芳对于这些荣誉的认识是客观的，他说：“这些荣誉首先应该归功于党，归功于全村人民。如果没有上级党委的正确领导，没有全体党员和全村群众的积极努力，单凭我一个人的力量，是不能获得这样的成绩的。”
