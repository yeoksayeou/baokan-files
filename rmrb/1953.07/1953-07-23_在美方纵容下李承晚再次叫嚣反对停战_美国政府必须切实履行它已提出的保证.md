Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 22nd.

    Our Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Syngman Rhee, with the indulgence of the U.S. side, has once again openly opposed the armistice.
    Syngman Rhee issued a statement on the 22nd, openly threatening to sabotage the Korean armistice. Although Harrison had already assured the Korean and Chinese side on July 16th that "We have obtained the necessary assurances from the Government of the Republic of Korea that it will not obstruct in any way the implementation of the draft terms of the Armistice Agreement," Syngman Rhee said today that his non-obstruction of the armistice has a time limit and is conditional. He said that the agreement he reached with Robertson was: He would not sign the armistice agreement, but he would not obstruct the armistice within ninety days. The condition is: the United States guarantees that the Chinese People's Volunteers will withdraw from Korea within these ninety days. Syngman Rhee's so-called demand for the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is entirely an excuse for him to sabotage the Korean armistice. Because it is well known that since the beginning of the armistice negotiations, the Korean and Chinese side have consistently advocated that all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should withdraw from Korea, and this proposal has been embodied in the draft armistice agreement, which stipulates that the political conference to be held after the armistice will discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. Syngman Rhee only mentions the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers without mentioning the withdrawal of all foreign troops, in order to facilitate his re-launching of the war in an attempt to realize his ambition of "unifying Korea by force." This can be seen from his statement today. He said, "In this regard, I must say that we have asked the United States either to re-take military action with us to complete our common goal, or to promise us moral and material support when we fight alone."
    Syngman Rhee also claimed that even with this agreement, he is not bound by it until Washington confirms it. He said that if the United States does not consider his wishes, "then we will not consider this understanding binding on us." Before Syngman Rhee issued his statement, his Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai also said, "Unless the United States is prepared to take actions contrary to Nam Il's statement, I don't see what meaning there is to the understanding within the scope of the Syngman Rhee-Robertson agreement." This means that not only after the armistice is realized, but even before the armistice is realized, Syngman Rhee is plotting to take new provocative actions to sabotage the armistice.
    The reason why Syngman Rhee dares to be so rampant in openly clamoring to sabotage the armistice is entirely because he is indulged by the U.S. side, especially encouraged by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles himself. Since General Nam Il's statement was issued on the 19th, Syngman Rhee's henchmen have constantly clamored that their final attitude towards the armistice depends on the U.S. guarantees. The U.S. side not only did not come forward to stop this clamor, but Dulles personally came out to encourage it greatly.
    Dulles said five days ago that "the Communist demand for the United Nations Command to guarantee South Korea's future behavior is absurd." On the 21st, he held a press conference in Washington and tried his best to spread pessimistic air about the possibility of realizing the Korean armistice. Dulles attempted to slander the Korean and Chinese side for lacking sincerity in the armistice, and also said that if Korea is "re-attacked," "the United States will retaliate against such actions." This is to encourage Syngman Rhee to re-launch the war under the pretext of "re-attacked," and to express that the United States will continue the war together with Syngman Rhee.
    The day after Dulles spoke, Syngman Rhee issued the above-mentioned challenging statement. This fully shows to what dangerous situation the United States' continued indulgence of Syngman Rhee has placed the Korean armistice. Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai is now even more arrogant. He told Reuters reporters on the evening of the 22nd that South Korea now believes that the agreement between Syngman Rhee and Robertson has been broken, and said, "Anything can happen." "We will not comply with the implementation of the armistice." Obviously, the Syngman Rhee gang is determined to sabotage the armistice. The U.S. government must clearly state its attitude and must immediately and conscientiously fulfill the guarantees it has already made, and stop any sabotage by Syngman Rhee. If the U.S. government continues to indulge Syngman Rhee, and as a result, the realization of the armistice is once again hindered and sabotaged, it must bear absolute responsibility.

### 在美方纵容下李承晚再次叫嚣反对停战  美国政府必须切实履行它已提出的保证

    在美方纵容下李承晚再次叫嚣反对停战
    美国政府必须切实履行它已提出的保证
    【新华社开城二十二日电】本社特派记者江南报道：李承晚在美方的纵容下又再次公开反对停战了。
    李承晚二十二日发表声明，公开威胁说要破坏朝鲜停战。虽然哈利逊在七月十六日已经向朝中方面保证说：“我们已从大韩民国政府获得必要的保证，即：它将不以任何方式阻挠停战协定草案条款的实施。”可是李承晚今天说，他不阻挠停战是有期限的，并且是有条件的。他说，他和罗伯逊取得的协议是：他不在停战协定上签字，但是他在九十天之内不阻碍停战。条件是：美国保证在这九十天之内，使中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤退。李承晚说，如果在九十天之后还不能做到这一点，“我们就得随意地照我们自己的办法行动”。李承晚所谓要中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤退，完全是他要破坏朝鲜停战的藉口。因为尽人皆知，朝中方面从停战谈判开始就一贯主张所有外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，都要从朝鲜撤退，这个主张并且已体现在停战协定草案中，协定草案规定在停战后举行的政治会议上将讨论一切外国军队撤出朝鲜问题。李承晚只提要中国人民志愿军撤退而不提一切外国军队撤退，为的是便于他重新发动战争，来企图实现他“武力统一朝鲜”的野心。这可以从他今天的声明中看出来。他说，“在这方面，我必须说我们已要求美国或者与我们一起重新采取军事行动，以完成我们的共同目标，或者答应在我们单独地进行战斗时给予我们精神上和物质上的支持。”
    李承晚并且声称，即使有了这项协议，但是在华盛顿没有确认这项协议以前，他是不受约束的。他说，如果美国不考虑他的愿望，“那末我们也就不认为这种谅解对我们有约束力”。在李承晚发表声明之前，他的外务部长官卞荣泰也说，“除非美国准备采取和南日声明相反的行动，我就看不出在李承晚——罗伯逊协议的范围内的谅解会有什么意义。”这就是说，不但在停战实现以后，而且就在停战实现以前，李承晚阴谋采取新的挑衅行动来破坏停战。
    李承晚之所以敢于如此猖狂地公开叫嚣要破坏停战，完全是因为受了美方的纵容，特别是美国国务卿杜勒斯本人的鼓励。自从南日大将的声明在十九日发表以后，李承晚的爪牙就不断叫嚣说，他们对停战的最后态度要看美国方面的保证而定。美国方面对于这种叫嚣不但没有出面加以制止，反而由杜勒斯亲自出马大加鼓励。
    杜勒斯在五天以前就说，“共方要联合国军担保韩国将来的行为的要求是荒谬的”。二十一日，他在华盛顿举行记者招待会，又对朝鲜停战实现的可能性竭力散布悲观空气。杜勒斯企图诬蔑朝中方面对停战缺乏诚意，并且还说，如果朝鲜“重新受到侵略”，“美国将对这种行动予以还击”。这就是鼓励李承晚在“重新受到侵略”的藉口下重新发动战争，并表示美国将和李承晚一起继续进行战争。
    就在杜勒斯谈话后的第二天，李承晚便发表了上述的挑战性的声明。这充分说明美国对李承晚继续采取纵容态度，已置朝鲜停战于何等危险的境地。李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰现在更加嚣张了，他二十二日晚对路透社记者说：南朝鲜现在认为李承晚和罗伯逊的协议已经破裂了，并且说：“任何事情都可以发生”。“我们将不遵守停战的履行。”很显然，李承晚匪帮已决心要破坏停战，美国政府必须明确表明它的态度，必须立即切实履行它已经提出了的保证，制止李承晚的任何破坏行为。美国政府如果对李承晚继续采取纵容态度，因而使停战的实现再度遭到阻挠和破坏，它就必须担负绝对的责任。
