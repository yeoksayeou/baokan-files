Experiences in Mobilizing Technical Personnel to Participate in the Establishment of the Responsibility System Movement
Angang Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company

Angang Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Company vigorously mobilized technical personnel to participate in the establishment of the responsibility system movement, which resulted in good results. The Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company has the following experiences in this regard:

Let Technical Personnel Speak Their Minds

At the beginning, Angang Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company had a relatively clear understanding of mobilizing technical personnel to participate in the establishment of the responsibility system movement. However, when assigning tasks, no specific methods were put forward for mobilizing technical personnel. Therefore, after the movement started, apart from some young technicians and a few engineers actively participating, most of the others hesitated and waited, rarely spoke at meetings, and had no opinions on whether it was good or bad. In response to this situation, the company leaders decided to break down the concerns of the technical personnel and make them speak their minds.

On April 19th, a symposium for engineers was held, presided over by the company manager and chief engineer. The manager reviewed the shortcomings of insufficient assistance to everyone in the past and asked everyone to talk about their opinions on the movement. The engineers were very happy and talked about their true thoughts, pointing out the reasons why some engineers and technical personnel were not actively participating in the movement: they had worked for a long time in the old society, were deeply influenced by old ideas, and had not completely reformed themselves in the past few years, so they were indifferent to various movements. Most technical personnel believed that the leadership only used technical personnel without educating them, with more criticism and less praise, and a lack of political leadership.

Through this symposium, the company leaders further realized that if they wanted to fully mobilize technical personnel, they must understand the thinking of technical personnel and let them speak their minds. To this end, the company party committee and administrative leadership carried out the following work:

1. Continued to hold two symposiums for technical personnel, patiently listened to their opinions, and studied with them how to carry out the establishment of the responsibility system movement. Finally, they explained the purpose of the movement again, dispelled their ideological concerns, and encouraged them to actively participate in the movement.

2. Responsible cadres visited the homes of technical personnel. The company manager and director visited the homes of many engineers. This not only changed the relationship between superiors and subordinates, but also allowed the engineers to say things they had never said before. One engineer said: "I still hold a resistant attitude towards the movement, thinking that we will be rectified anyway. I will neither expose nor review now, and see what you can do!" Later, after the explanation and help from the company leaders, his thinking was cleared up. At the meeting the next day, he took the initiative to review his wrong attitude towards the movement and exposed the waste and lack of responsibility in project management in the past.

3. Middle-level party member cadres conducted individual talks with technical personnel separately. Four work sections and the engineering technology section did a better job in this regard. Section chiefs and section heads used evening or spare time to solicit technical personnel's opinions on the movement, explain their doubts to them, and assign them tasks in the movement.

4. Understand the thinking of technical personnel through the party and youth league system, and then, after research, designate special personnel to provide specific help.

Through these efforts, the engineering and technical personnel initially felt the warmth of the organization, and their enthusiasm began to rise. The leadership also went deep into the masses, truly figured out the reasons why some technical personnel failed to actively participate in the movement, and pointed out the direction and created conditions for further mobilizing technical personnel to participate in the movement.

Absorbing Technical Personnel to Participate in the Leadership of the Movement

From the true words of the technical personnel, the company leaders found the shortcomings of insufficient leadership, education, and attention to engineering and technical personnel. Therefore, they immediately took the following measures to strengthen the leadership of the technical personnel.

First, absorb technical personnel to participate in the leadership of the movement. There are three methods: when holding meetings of section heads, team leaders, and section directors, and arranging and studying work, invite all engineers to participate, discuss and summarize together; select a certain number of engineers to serve as group leaders of the movement. As a result, the key exposure work of the first and fifth work sections went very smoothly and yielded great results.

Engineering and technical personnel have taken it as their own responsibility to do a good job in the movement, and they have adopted a positive attitude towards the movement.

Secondly, when the party branch holds meetings or convenes activists' meetings, invite engineers to participate, analyze the development of the movement together, study the methods of carrying out the movement, and solicit their opinions on the leadership of the movement. They saw with their own eyes the respect and trust of the party and the leadership, and they were very happy, and they all expressed their determination to do a good job in the movement.

Third, in the movement, often assign certain work to technical personnel, such as assigning them to conduct investigation and research on key issues, assigning them to specifically help less active comrades to dispel ideological concerns, and the leaders regularly ask them to report, so that the enthusiasm of technical personnel to participate in the movement is greatly improved.

Technical Personnel Lead Technical Personnel

Not long after the implementation of the responsibility system movement began, the company leaders conducted an individual talk with an engineer in order to understand the thinking of the masses. When asked what he thought of the movement, he was silent for a moment, and then said: "Some technical personnel see that the leadership only believes in a few activists, so they do not take the initiative to approach the leading comrades and participate in the movement." This sentence not only made a correct criticism of the company leaders, but also provided an important method for mobilizing technical personnel to participate in the movement - that is, technical personnel lead technical personnel. The company leaders attached great importance to this opinion and immediately did so. The method is:

Cultivate activists among senior technical personnel, so that they actively participate in the movement and lead other technical personnel. Engineer Fan Ruoqun of the first work section has always been active in the movement, and he spoke boldly when exposing waste and lack of responsibility. When turning to key inspections, he reviewed himself, and he took the initiative to do ideological work in his spare time. Therefore, the technical personnel of the first work section were greatly inspired.

Organize typical speeches with preparation, planning, and purpose. In the first stage of the movement, many units organized engineers who had a good understanding of the movement to report to everyone; when starting to expose waste and lack of responsibility, some units also cultivated engineers to be the central speakers. During the key inspection, the third and fifth work sections cultivated engineers and technicians to make typical reports, introducing the waste and lack of responsibility in key projects, analyzing the causes of these problems, and reviewing themselves in connection with themselves, so as to guide everyone to conduct in-depth inspections.

Timely praise the technical personnel who actively participate in the movement. The company leaders praised Engineer Fan Ruoqun of the first work section and Chen Yulin (engineer), deputy section chief of the engineering technology section, at the meeting. All sections and work sections have praised many engineers and technicians, thus pointing out the direction for technical personnel who are not very active in participating in the movement.

Facts have proved that it is easier for technical personnel to understand the thinking of technical personnel, eliminate the doubts of some technical personnel, and set an example for technical personnel by letting technical personnel lead technical personnel.

Repeatedly Explain Policies to Technical Personnel

At the beginning of the movement, several engineers in the first work section mostly stood on the sidelines and were dissatisfied with the leadership. One engineer once said: "The movement is for the activists, it has nothing to do with us. I will do my job well. It doesn't matter to me whether I move or not." Therefore, the engineers did not speak when they began to expose waste and lack of responsibility. The party and administrative comrades in charge of the work section studied this situation and immediately strengthened the ideological leadership of the technical personnel and patiently and specifically explained to them the relationship between the individual and the movement. Therefore, the technical personnel participated in the movement more actively than before. Later, as the movement gradually deepened, the masses demanded to enter key inspections. At this time, some technical personnel became suspicious again. An engineer said in an individual talk with the director: "After doing it for a long time, the responsibility lies with us engineers. Now I am just waiting to be punished!" In addition, at party branch meetings, sometimes some people have misunderstandings, fearing that they will be mobilized to rectify themselves. Individual technical personnel sometimes have to think for a long time about a sentence from the responsible comrade to see if it is related to themselves. All these changes have attracted the attention of the work section leaders. The responsible cadres and activists of the section divided their work and specifically helped certain technical personnel break down their concerns. The party's responsible comrades repeatedly explained to everyone: the responsibility system movement exposes the waste phenomenon in the past in order to find out the reasons, improve everyone's ideological level, and lay the foundation for the establishment of the responsibility system, not to settle old accounts and rectify individuals. So the chief engineer took the lead in exposing and inspecting, and often organized small symposiums. The section chief also often had individual talks with engineers. As a result, the technical personnel of the section turned from fearing "being rectified" to happily participating in or leading the movement.

The ideological development process of several engineers in the first work section shows that in the past, due to insufficient access, education, and care for technical personnel by the leadership, some technical personnel had prejudices, and whenever a movement came, they thought: "I am going to be unlucky." Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must grasp the thinking of technical personnel and explain policies to them in a timely, frequent, and repeated manner. In carrying out this work, attention should also be paid to the following issues:

Party and administrative responsible comrades should preside over symposiums or conduct individual talks; educate party members, league members, and activists to act in accordance with policies so as to avoid mistakes and arouse the concerns of the masses; when analyzing the problems exposed, pay attention to explaining policies through specific examples and explain that personnel who review their shortcomings will not be punished, and the leadership will not treat them differently.

    发动技术人员参加建立责任制运动的经验
    鞍钢炼钢建筑工程公司
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢建筑工程公司在建立责任制运动中大力发动技术人员参加，使运动收到很好的效果。在这方面，炼钢建筑工程公司有下面几点经验：
    让技术人员说出真心话
    炼钢建筑工程公司开始对于发动技术人员参加建立责任制运动的认识是比较明确的，但在布置任务时，没有提出发动技术人员的具体办法。因此，运动开展后，除一些年青的技术员和少数工程师积极参加运动外，其余多犹豫观望，开会很少发言，好坏都没意见。根据这一情况，公司领导方面决心打破技术人员的顾虑，使技术人员说出他们想要说的话。
    四月十九日，由公司经理和总工程师主持，召开工程师座谈会。经理检讨了过去对大家帮助不够的缺点，请大家谈谈对运动的意见。工程师们很高兴，都谈了自己真实的思想情况，说出部分工程师和技术人员不积极参加运动的原因：在旧社会工作时间较长，受旧思想感染也深，几年来自我改造还不彻底，因而对各种运动漠不关心。多数技术人员认为领导上对技术人员是光使用不教育，批评多，表扬少，缺乏政治领导。
    通过这次座谈，公司领导方面进一步认识了要想充分发动技术人员，必须了解技术人员的思想情况，让技术人员说出真心话。为此，公司党委和行政领导方面又进行了下列工作：
    一、继续召开了两次技术人员座谈会，耐心听取他们的意见，和他们研究怎样开展建立责任制运动，最后再次说明运动的目的，打消他们的思想顾虑，鼓励他们积极参加运动。
    二、负责干部到技术人员家里访问。公司经理、主任访问过很多工程师的家。这不但改变了上下之间的关系，而且工程师们说出了从来没有说出的话。一位工程师说：“我对运动还抱着抗拒态度，认为反正我们是挨整，我现在不揭发也不检讨，看你们怎样办吧！”后来经过公司领导方面的解释、帮助，他的思想搞通了，在第二天的会议上主动检讨了自己对待运动的错误态度，并揭发了过去在工程管理上的浪费和无人负责现象。
    三、中层党员干部分别与技术人员进行个别谈话，在这方面有四个工段和工程技术科做的较好。段主任和科长利用晚上或工余时间，征求技术人员对运动的意见，为他们解释疑问，分配他们在运动中的任务。
    四、经过党、青年团系统了解技术人员的思想情况，然后经过研究，再指定专人具体进行帮助。
    通过这些工作，工程技术人员初步感到了组织的温暖，情绪开始高涨。领导方面也由于深入到群众中去，真正摸清了某些技术人员未能积极参加运动的原因，给进一步发动技术人员参加运动指出了方向和创造了条件。
    吸收技术人员参加运动的领导
    从技术人员的真心话中，公司领导方面发现了对工程技术人员领导教育和重视不够的缺点，于是，立即采取以下做法，加强了对技术人员的领导。
    首先，吸收技术人员参加运动的领导，其方法有三：召开科长、队长、段主任会议，布置、研究工作时，请全体工程师参加，一块讨论，一块总结；选拔一定数量的工程师担任运动组长，这样做的结果，一、五工段的重点揭发工作进行得非常顺利，而且收获很大。
    工程技术人员们把搞好运动当成了自己的责任，对运动就采取了积极态度。
    其次，党支部开会或召开积极分子会议时，请工程师参加，一起分析运动发展的情况，共同研究运动进行的方法，征求他们对运动领导的意见。他们亲眼看到了党和领导方面对他们的尊重和信任，感到非常高兴，都表示决心要把运动搞好。
    第三，在运动中经常分配给技术人员一定的工作，如分配他们做重点问题的调查研究，分配他们具体帮助不大积极的同志解除思想顾虑，领导同志定期请其汇报，这样，就使技术人员参加运动的积极性大大提高。
    技术人员带动技术人员
    贯彻责任制运动开始不久，公司领导方面为了解群众的思想情况，曾和一个工程师进行了个别谈话。当问到他对运动有何意见时，他沉默了一下，然后说：“有些技术人员看见领导方面光是相信几个积极分子，因而便不主动接近领导同志和参加运动。”这句话不但对公司领导方面提出了正确的批评，而且给发动技术人员参加运动提供了一个重要方法——即由技术人员带动技术人员。公司领导方面非常重视这个意见，而且立即这样做了。其方式是：
    在较高级的技术人员中培养积极分子，使他们积极参加运动，并带动其他技术人员。一工段工程师范若群在运动中一贯积极，揭发浪费和无人负责现象时，他大胆发言。转入重点检查时，他检讨自己，每逢工作之余，他就主动进行思想工作，因此，对一工段的技术人员启发很大。
    有准备、有计划、有目的地组织典型发言。在运动的前一段，有不少单位组织对运动有了认识的工程师向大家报告；在开始揭发浪费和无人负责现象时，也有些单位培养工程师作中心发言人。在重点检查时，三、五工段又培养工程师、技术员作典型报告，介绍重点工程中的浪费和无人负责现象，分析产生这些问题的原因，并联系自己进行检讨，以引导大家深入检查。
    及时表扬参加运动积极的技术人员，公司领导方面曾在会议上表扬过一工段工程师范若群，工程技术科副科长陈雨林（工程师），各科各段都表扬过不少工程师和技术员，这样便给参加运动不大积极的技术人员指出了方向。
    事实证明，由技术人员去带动技术人员，容易摸清技术人员的思想情况，消除某些技术人员的疑虑，并给技术人员树立榜样。
    反复向技术人员交代政策
    第一工段在运动开始时，几位工程师多半是站在一边看运动，而且对领导不满。一位工程师曾这样说：“运动是积极分子的，没有我们的事，我把工作作好，运动不运动，和我没关系”。因此，开始揭发浪费和无人负责现象时，工程师不发言。工段党、行政负责同志研究了这种情况，立即加强了对技术人员的思想领导，并耐心地、具体地向他们说明个人与运动的关系，因此技术人员参加运动较前活跃了。后来，运动逐步深入，群众要求进入重点检查，这时某些技术人员又发生了怀疑，一位工程师在和主任个别谈话时说：“搞来搞去，责任都是我们工程师的，现在我就等着受处分呢！”此外，党支部开会，有时一些人发生误会，只怕发动大家整自己，个别技术人员有时对负责同志的一句话，也要考虑半天，看是否与自己有关。所有这些变化，都引起工段领导方面的注意。该段的负责干部和积极分子分工，具体帮助某些技术人员打破顾虑。党的负责同志反复向大家说明：建立责任制运动揭发过去的浪费现象是为了找出原因，提高大家的思想水平，为建立责任制打下基础，而不是为了算旧帐，整个人。于是主任工程师带头揭发检查，并经常组织小型的座谈会，段主任也经常和工程师个别谈心。结果该段的技术人员由害怕“挨整”而转为愉快地参加或领导运动了。
    第一工段几位工程师的思想发展过程表明：过去由于领导方面对技术人员接近、教育和照顾不够，以致某些技术人员有了成见，每逢运动一来，都认为：“自己要倒霉”。因此，各级领导干部都必须掌握技术人员的思想情况，及时地、经常地、反复不断地向他们交代政策。在进行这一工作时，还应该注意以下几个问题：
    党和行政负责同志要主持座谈会或进行个别谈话；教育党员、团员和积极分子，一定按政策办事，以免发生错误和引起群众的顾虑；在对揭发出的问题进行分析时，要注意通过具体的事例交代政策，说明对检讨缺点的人员并不处分，领导方面也不另眼看待等。
