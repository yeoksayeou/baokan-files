    Some Elementary Schools in Suqian County Should Not Organize "Service Teams" Among Students

    Yu Ai, of the Suicheng District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, writes: This semester, the Chengzhong Elementary School in our county established a "service team" among the students. Its task is to specifically manage the activities of elementary school students and serve the teachers. The "service team" has more than 20 members, who are rotated daily from each class. The members wear badges and are stationed at the school gate, the teachers' office, the playground, and the entrances of each classroom. Under the management of the "service team members," elementary school students are even restricted from going out to pour tea. Students who are on the "service team" have no rest or self-study time outside of class, and they cannot even take a nap. According to my understanding, the Chengbei and Pingmin Elementary Schools in our district also have "service teams." I believe that this practice violates the spirit of cultivating children's conscious observance of discipline, and it causes the on-duty students to have too many activities, which affects their studies and health. The Culture and Education Section of the Suqian County People's Government should quickly correct this.

    宿迁县某些小学不应在学生中组织“服务队”
    中共江苏省宿迁县宿城区委会育爱来信：我县城中完全小学本学期在学生中成立了一个“服务队”，它的任务是专门管理小学生的活动和替教师们服务。“服务队”的队员共二十多人，由各班级的学生每天轮流担任。队员戴着证章，分布在校门、教师办公室、操场和各班教室门口站岗。在“服务队员”的管理下，小学生外出倒茶喝都受到限制。担任“服务队”的学生除上课外，没有休息和自习时间，甚至连午觉也不能睡。据我了解，我区城北、平民两所完全小学也有“服务队”的组织。我认为：这种作法违反了培养儿童们自觉遵守纪律的精神，并使值日学生活动过多而影响学习和健康。宿迁县人民政府文教科应当赶快纠正。
