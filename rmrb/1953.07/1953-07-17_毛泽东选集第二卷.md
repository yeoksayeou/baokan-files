    Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II
    Soviet Vi. Mikhailov
    The Foreign Languages ​​Press has published the Russian translation of Volume II of Selected Works of Comrade Mao Zedong [Note].
    The works published in the second volume were all written in 1937 and 1938—during the early stage of the Chinese people's sacred war of resistance against Japanese aggressors. Comrade Mao Zedong’s works summarized the experience of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people in the revolutionary struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and demonstrated the historical significance of the Chinese people’s struggle. The Chinese people rose up under the banner of the Communist Party, played a great role in the struggle to crush Japanese imperialism, and won the victory of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution.
    The second volume of Selected Works of Mao Zedong begins with works related to the summer of 1937.
    In 1937, a serious situation formed in China. Since the Japanese imperialists occupied Northeast China (Manchuria) in 1931, they had been invading the Chinese mainland year after year. By the end of 1936, the Japanese aggressors had occupied Inner Mongolia and North China in addition to the Northeast, directly threatening Beijing. Tens of thousands of Japanese troops were gathered along railways, seaports, and strategic strongholds, preparing for a large-scale offensive against the Chinese mainland. All of China faced the grave danger of being enslaved by Japanese warlords.
    Among all political parties in China, only the Communist Party fought from beginning to end to organize resistance against Japanese aggressors from the first day of the Japanese invasion of China. A few days after the Japanese army occupied Northeast China, on September 25, 1931, the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary government of the liberated area called on the people to defend the motherland and issued the slogan: "Expel the Japanese bandits from China by sea, land and air!" When the Kuomintang government lost thousands of miles of territory without firing a shot, the Chinese Communists went to the occupied areas of Northeast China to organize the people's anti-Japanese struggle. Since 1934, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army has been fighting in the Northeast under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Under the influence of the Communist Party's call, the Chinese people's demands for resistance against aggressors became more and more resolute. From 1935 to 1937, countless anti-Japanese strikes by workers and vigorous student demonstrations took place in Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing and other cities. However, the Chiang Kai-shek group ignored the people's demands, continued its policy of compromise and concession to the Japanese, opened fire on anti-Japanese marchers and continued to attack the Chinese Red Army. This traitorous policy of the Chiang Kai-shek government facilitated the Japanese imperialists' expansion of their aggression against China.
    On July 7, 1937, the Japanese warlords created the Lugouqiao Incident near Beijing and openly launched a war against the Chinese people. The Chinese working people responded to the Japanese imperialists' unjust war of aggression with a national liberation war. The danger of destroying all of China accelerated the establishment of the anti-Japanese national united front among all patriotic forces in China, including the middle bourgeoisie. Under the pressure of the people, the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique was also forced to join the united front, but later events showed that the Chiang Kai-shek elements adopted a double-dealing attitude.
    Most of the works published in the second volume of Selected Works of Mao Zedong, including: "The Orientation, Methods, and Prospects of Resisting the Japanese Advance," "Strive to Mobilize All Forces to Win Victory in the War of Resistance,"
    "The Situation and Tasks of the Anti-Japanese War After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan,"
    "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War," etc., are works that determine the nature of the war, the issue of the united front, and the tasks of the Communist Party in the national war. In these works, Comrade Mao Zedong carefully examined various issues that arose with the beginning of the war: which forces would participate in the war? How to unite these forces? Who will lead the united front? What is the role of the Communist Party in the war? What kind of political and economic measures should be taken to attract all the people to defend the country and win victory, etc.
    In the work "The Orientation, Methods, and Prospects of Resisting the Japanese Advance," Comrade Mao Zedong demonstrated the Communist Party's line in the just-started war. This line represented the unanimous demand of the Chinese people: resolutely resist Japanese imperialism, drive Japanese imperialism out of China, and mobilize the people of the whole country to participate in the war of national defense. The Communist Party implemented the
    The slogan is "Those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money, those who have guns contribute guns, and those who have knowledge contribute knowledge." The Chiang Kai-shek group adopted a line that was completely opposed to that of the Communist Party. They opposed a people's war and implemented a reactionary policy of passive resistance.
    The line put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, which conformed to the interests of the proletariat and the interests of the Chinese people, was reflected in the Ten Major Policies for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation. This program was described in the outline written by Comrade Mao Zedong for propagandists. In August 1937, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved this outline. In the second volume, this outline is published under the title "Strive to Mobilize All Forces to Win Victory in the War of Resistance." This program defined the tasks of the Chinese Communist Party in the war against Japanese aggressors and in the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary, double-dealing policy.
    The basic requirement of the Ten Major Policies for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation is the general mobilization of the people of the whole country and reliance on the strength of the entire Chinese people to wage war. The program pointed out: "The combination of people's power and military power will deal a fatal blow to Japanese imperialism. A national war that does not rely on the masses of the people will undoubtedly not be able to achieve victory." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II, Chinese Edition, Page 303)
    The program includes various military, economic and political measures: adhering to resistance to the end, general mobilization of the people across the country, arming the people, actively fighting on the main battlefield, and widely launching guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, democratizing the national system, reducing rent and interest, improving the treatment of workers and staff, developing national education, eliminating traitors, sellouts, pro-Japanese factions, and capitulationist compromisers, and consolidating the rear. Everyone knows that the implementation of these methods by the Communist Party in the liberated areas guaranteed the great military victory of the people's army and guerrillas and consolidated the foundation of the united front—the alliance of workers and peasants.
    In the works written by Comrade Mao Zedong from 1937 to 1938, he repeatedly emphasized that developing a united front is a necessary condition for crushing Japanese imperialism and establishing a unified democratic republic, and paves the way for China to embark on a bright and great future. The Chinese Communist Party suggested consolidating state power by establishing a coalition government, a government that has contact with the people and can guide the war to victory. The popular nature of the War of Resistance Against Japan definitely raised the issue that the entire Chinese political system must be democratized; "...If the purpose of the war directly represents the interests of the people, the more democratic the government, the better the war will be conducted. ...The nature of the war determines the relationship between the government and the people. This is a historical principle." (Ibid., Page 345)
    At the end of 1937, the Kuomintang authorities refused to allow the broad masses of the people to participate in the war against Japanese aggressors, which caused major defeats on the front line and the abandonment of important industrial cities and strategic centers such as Shanghai and Taiyuan. At this time, the correctness of the Communist Party's policy was more clearly confirmed. This volume contains Comrade Mao Zedong's outline of the report at the meeting of party activists in Yan'an in November 1937 - "The Situation and Tasks of the Anti-Japanese War After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan" which elaborates the tasks of the Communist Party during this period. The report pointed out that the war was still unilateral in nature: only the government and the army participated in the war, not the masses of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Unilateral resistance will definitely lead the war to failure" (Ibid., Page 348). Only the North China region has achieved success, and the army's operations have been supported by widely launched guerrilla warfare. Democratic regimes of all parties and factions were established in the liberated areas. The actual situation in the liberated areas and the struggle of the people in the Kuomintang rear showed that China was transitioning from a unilateral war to a people's war.
    This work points out that in the struggle to unite all the forces of the united front, the Communists must see the differences in each part of the national united front, and adapt their policies to this situation, and establish their attitude toward each participant in the national united front. The Communist Party divided the composition of the united front at that time into: the left-wing group - the masses of the people led by the Communist Party: the proletariat, peasants, and urban petty-bourgeois masses; the middle group - the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie; the right-wing group - the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie. When Comrade Mao Zedong talked about representatives of the right wing, he said: "This is the main camp of national capitulationism. On the one hand, they are afraid of the destruction of their property by the war, and on the other hand, they are afraid of the rise of the masses. Their tendency to surrender is inevitable." (Ibid., Page 357) In order to defeat the enemy, the Chinese Communist Party exposed the capitulationist compromisers of the right wing and consolidated the left wing of the united front, thereby strengthening the entire national united front.
    Mobilizing millions of people to participate in the war to defend the motherland, ending the reactionary policy of the Kuomintang right wing, and laying the foundation for the democratization of the political system in order to win the victory of the war—this is the first conclusion drawn by the Chinese Communist Party from the experience of the war, which Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly demonstrated in his works. In order to successfully complete this task, it is necessary to consolidate the only force that the Communist Party can lead the Chinese people's struggle.
        ×××
    In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War of Liberation, the Chinese Communist Party clearly stipulated the tasks and obligations of every Communist Party member in the new situation created by the war. The party refuted various opportunist attempts, which refused to take advantage of the opportunities that had emerged to launch a broader legal struggle, mobilize the masses, and consolidate its position. The party also condemned the demands put forward by opportunists that the Communist Party submit to the control of the Kuomintang group. The purpose of the Kuomintang group was to limit the scope of activities of the Communist Party and weaken the people's patriotic movement.
    These works of Comrade Mao Zedong demonstrate the victory of the Marxist doctrine on the party, on the party's organizational principles and ideological principles. In complete accordance with the requirements of Marxism, Comrade Mao Zedong said in November 1937: "The 'Left' leaning closed-door policy must still be prevented. But at the same time, the principle of independence and autonomy must be closely linked to all united front work." (Ibid., Page 354)
    In the work "On Protracted War" (May 1938), the author explained that the Chinese people must win because China has a great force—the fighting Communist Party, the revolutionary people's army led by the party, and the vigorous development of all progressive forces in the country. The Chinese Communist Party's unshakable confidence in the invincible power of the people's masses, the justice of the task of liberation war, and its ability to apply Marxism in China's specific conditions promoted the consolidation of the national united front and united the masses around the Communist Party.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's report at the plenary session of the Central Committee in October 1938, "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War," which was published in the second volume, also clarified the new tasks of the party. The plenary session approved the line of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party elaborated in this report, the line of fighting for the independence and autonomy of the Communist Party and all its local organizations, and the line of opposing accommodation to the Kuomintang and opposing class capitulationism. The plenary session determined that the main task of the Communist Party at that time was to carry out independent and autonomous work in the war zones and behind enemy lines, and launch guerrilla warfare. This report demonstrates the justice of the war waged by the Chinese people. It is of great significance for mobilizing Communist Party members and national patriotic forces to participate in the long-term war. It points out to every Communist Party member his position in the war of national defense. Defending the motherland against Japanese aggression is the obligation of a Communist Party member, because only in this way can a Communist Party member fulfill his internationalist obligations under the conditions of the war of liberation. "China is a country that has been invaded. Therefore, Chinese Communists must combine patriotism and internationalism. ...If China wins and the imperialists who invade China are overthrown, it will also help the people of foreign countries. Therefore, patriotism is the implementation of internationalism in the national liberation war." (Ibid., Page 483)
    In those difficult days, the party demanded that every party member display a spirit of heroic sacrifice and indomitable spirit, and be good at cooperating with the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the report: "Communist Party members in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army should become models of heroic combat, models of executing orders, models of abiding by discipline, models of political work, and models of internal unity. ... They should be as good as their word, act as they say, not be arrogant, and sincerely discuss issues and work together with friendly parties and friendly troops..."
    (Ibid., Page 484).
    The party called on Communist Party members to guard against arrogance and serve the people, and demanded that every Communist Party member be a friend and teacher of the people, not a bureaucratic politician, and demanded that individual interests be subordinated to the interests of the nation and the masses of the people. In the report, Comrade Mao Zedong reminded Communist Party members that Communist Party members are only the vanguard of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. "We must understand," said Comrade Mao Zedong, "that Communist Party members are only a small part of the entire nation. There are a large number of advanced elements and activists outside the party, and we must work with them." (Ibid., Page 484)
    Comrade Mao Zedong said that in order to play the role of vanguard and lead the people forward, Communist Party members must constantly learn to become models of being realistic and farsighted, pointing out that theoretical knowledge helps us not to lose our way forward. Communist Party members "should become models of learning. They are teachers of the people every day, but they are also students of the people every day. Only by learning from the people, learning from the environment, learning from friendly parties and friendly troops, and understanding them, can they be realistic in their work and have foresight about the future." (Ibid., Page 485)
    The vanguard role of the Communist Party is consistent with the party's leading role in the war and in the united front. However, not everyone understands this truth. From the beginning of the war and the first day of renewed cooperation with the Kuomintang, the Communist Party had to wage a tenacious struggle against the capitulationists within the party. They advocated that the Communist Party obey the Kuomintang and hand over the leadership of the united front to the bourgeoisie. This capitulationist line was specifically manifested in the policy of "everything through the united front," in the abolition of the Communist Party's principles of independence and autonomy, and in the attitude of accommodation toward the Kuomintang's attempts to weaken the Communist Party.
    At that time, some Communist Party members (Wang Ming, etc.) advocated handing over the leadership of the united front and the revolution to the bourgeoisie. In the report, Comrade Mao Zedong exposed the theoretical roots of right-leaning opportunism and sharply raised the issue of adhering to the leadership of the proletariat led by the Communist Party in the struggle for China's freedom and independence. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the root causes of right-leaning opportunism were the low theoretical level of some party members, the lack of experience of many party members in cooperating with other parties, the existence of petty-bourgeois elements in the party, and so on. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the Communist Party and its armed forces must maintain their organizational and political independence while cooperating with others in the united front. Capitulationism—disguised right-leaning opportunism—was the main danger at the time, so the party took decisive measures to thoroughly eliminate capitulationism.
    The Communist Party made its activities subordinate to the interests of the motherland, cooperated with other parties in action, and maintained the independence of the united front and its own principles of organizational independence and autonomy. It was this method that helped the party consolidate its ties with the masses.
    The increase in the Communist Party's influence among the people and its vanguard role in the war required Communist Party members to improve their theoretical level and to train and educate party cadres. At the same time, it was also important to train and educate non-party cadres. Comrade Mao Zedong said: There are many talented people outside the party, and the Communist Party cannot ignore them. It is the responsibility of every Communist Party member to get rid of arrogance, be good at working with non-party cadres, sincerely help them, treat them with a warm comrade attitude, and organize their enthusiasm into the great cause of resisting Japan and building the country.
    Comrade Mao Zedong went on to talk about consolidating party discipline and intra-party democracy in the report. He pointed out that if there is no solid discipline within the party, no principle of the minority subordinating to the majority is implemented, no intra-party democracy is guaranteed, and no serious theoretical study is conducted, it is impossible to train a large number of cadres. "The great power of Marxism-Leninism lies in its connection with the specific revolutionary practice of each country. For the Chinese Communist Party, it is necessary to learn to apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism to the specific environment of China." (Ibid., Page 497)
    The united, experienced Chinese Communist Party, tempered in the struggle for the victory of Marxism for 17 years, participated in the national liberation war. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, it became the "strong core" of the Chinese people, which guaranteed the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the building of a new China after the war.
        ×××
    The issues of war strategy and tactics in the Chinese people's national liberation war against Japanese aggressors occupy an important position in the second volume of Selected Works of Mao Zedong. These papers and lectures on military issues summarize the experience of the armed struggle led by the Communist Party against the enemies of the Chinese people.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's speech in Yan'an in late May and early June 1938 provided questions about the war against Japanese imperialism and the methods to carry it out. These speeches were published in the second volume under the general title "On Protracted War." Based on its assessment of the actual situation, the Communist Party gave the people confidence in winning victory in a long-term protracted war. On the one hand, it refuted the adventurous plans of acute patients who fantasized about a quick victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and on the other hand, it attacked the fallacies of defeatists who believed that China would inevitably be defeated.
    However, Comrade Mao Zedong said that victory will not come by itself. "...We admit that China is faced with two possible futures, liberation and national subjugation, and the two are fiercely struggling. Our task is to realize liberation and avoid national subjugation. The conditions for realizing liberation are basically China's progress, plus the enemy's difficulties and world assistance. Unlike the advocates of national subjugation, we objectively and comprehensively recognize that the two possibilities of national subjugation and liberation exist simultaneously, and emphasize that the possibility of liberation is dominant and the conditions for achieving liberation, and strive to achieve these conditions." (Ibid., Page 421)
    The Communist Party's conclusion that the Chinese people will inevitably win is based on a scientific analysis of the balance of power between China and Japan. The Communist Party starts from estimating the following facts. Japan is an aggressive imperialist power with a strong economy and a strong state machine. The imperialist nature of Japan's socio-economic system has produced the imperialist nature of Japan's war, so it is inevitable that it will fail in the war. It must also be estimated that Japan is smaller than China, so it will inevitably feel the lack of manpower, military strength, financial resources, and materials and cannot withstand a long-term war against China. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party also pointed out that Japan will inevitably fall into isolation in terms of international relations in the end. The Communist Party clearly acknowledged that China's military, economic, and general preparedness were not as good as Japan's. However, the Chinese Communist Party starts from the fact that China has the superiority that determines the victory or defeat of the war. Japan does not have and cannot have this superiority. China is waging a just, liberation war. All the people understand the purpose of the war and heroically sacrifice to defend their motherland. The Chinese people have a powerful progressive force, and the representative of this progressive force is first of all the Communist Party, which has the ability to guarantee the correct leadership of the all-people war against aggressors.
    China's advantages over Japan also include: large territory (which provides ample room for maneuver), abundant resources, large population, and the extensive international assistance that fighting China receives from progressive forces around the world. "Especially the existence of the Soviet Union encourages China's resistance. The unprecedentedly powerful socialist Soviet Union and China have always been closely related."
    (Ibid., Page 418)
    The Communist Party is convinced that the Chinese people will inevitably win final victory and actively carries out the Chinese reactionaries' policy of compromise and capitulation to Japanese imperialism. This policy is bound to fail, because there are forces at home and abroad that prevent this compromise and capitulation.
    Comrade Mao Zedong wrote that China's protracted war must go through three stages, and each stage has its own strategic characteristics. The first stage is the enemy's offensive and China's defense; the second stage is the stalemate stage, where the enemy attempts to hold on, while China prepares for a counteroffensive; the third stage is China's strategic counteroffensive and the enemy's strategic retreat.
    According to the author, the main form of operation adopted by the Chinese army in the first stage is mobile warfare by the regular army, supplemented by guerrilla warfare and positional warfare. The second stage can be called the stage of strategic stalemate. After reaching a certain limit of the strategic offensive, the enemy will attempt to conserve the occupied areas and try every means to plunder the Chinese people. At this time, in the enemy's rear, Chinese patriots will establish many guerrilla bases and areas to smash the enemy's conspiracy to hold on. In the second stage, there will still be large-scale wars on the front line, guerrilla warfare will have the main significance, and mobile warfare by the regular army will play a supporting role. The third stage can only come when the enemy is quite exhausted and China has reached sufficient strength to enter the general counteroffensive. Guerrilla warfare again plays a supporting role in this stage, strategically cooperating with mobile warfare and positional warfare by the regular army.
    In addition, the work "On Protracted War" also includes a series of conclusions on the characteristics of Chinese operations and on various operational methods. "On Protracted War" shows that the war with interspersed areas is a feature of Chinese operations.
    Operations in the areas occupied by the Japanese invaders put the enemy's strongholds under attack and blocked the enemy's roads to attack agricultural areas. The people, who harbored unparalleled hatred for the Japanese invaders, supported the war behind enemy lines and effectively attacked the Japanese occupiers. Turning the cities seized by the Japanese invaders into isolated islands, surrounded by vast guerrilla agricultural areas, and organizing military and political struggles in the countryside—these are the tasks put forward by the objective course of the war.
    This characteristic of the strategy of the War of Resistance Against Japan reflects China's special situation: the development of the liberation war and the bourgeois democratic revolution are combined. It is first of all combined with the struggle of millions of peasants, who constitute the basic masses of the Chinese army and guerrillas, for land and democratic freedom. By skillfully combining the anti-Japanese struggle against imperialism with the people's struggle to win economic and political liberation from the oppression of domestic reactionaries, the Communist Party won the majority among the Chinese people and guaranteed the victory of the revolution.
    When studying the operational nature of the Chinese army, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized the great role of mobile warfare alongside positional warfare. He said: "Among the operational forms of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the main one is mobile warfare, and the second is guerrilla warfare." (Ibid., Page 461)
    Based on the rich experience of the ten-year revolutionary war and taking into account China's special conditions, the Communists demonstrated and applied this mobile warfare tactic. They abandoned the harmful tactics of pure positional warfare. The Communists pointed out that the Chinese army must take advantage of China's two extremely important superior conditions: vast territory and large number of soldiers, which guarantee the possibility of using flexible forms of mobile warfare. This form of operation requires the army to be offensive, to attack the enemy by surprise, to require maximum mobility, to concentrate several divisions of the Chinese army to deal with one division of the enemy, to require attacks from all directions at the same time, to fight on the march, and so on. Units responsible for conducting mobile warfare can more easily achieve victory if they can get the coordinated operations of guerrillas.
    Comrade Mao Zedong fully estimated the great role of guerrilla warfare and advocated that at least hundreds of thousands of people be designated from the Chinese regular army and dispersed in all enemy-occupied areas. Launch and coordinate the people's armed forces to carry out guerrilla warfare. Everyone knows that the Chinese Communist Party implemented this plan. By 1945, in the areas where the Chinese People's Liberation Army was responsible for mobile warfare, there were more than two million guerrillas fighting against the enemy under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
    The Chinese Communist Party has always paid special attention to the issue of guerrilla warfare. The second volume publishes Comrade Mao Zedong's famous work: "Strategic Issues of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare" (May 1938). This work refutes the view that belittles the role of guerrilla warfare and plays a major role in establishing vast guerrilla forces under the leadership of the party and training regular troops by means of guerrilla warfare.
    Under China's special conditions, guerrilla warfare is an independent operation far away from the Chinese regular army's operation areas. "The long-term nature of the war, and the cruelty that follows, determine that guerrilla warfare cannot but do many extraordinary things, so the issues of base areas, development to mobile warfare, etc. also arise. So the guerrilla warfare of China's resistance against Japan has run out of the tactical scope and is knocking on the door of strategy..." (Ibid., Page 366).
    In his various works explaining military issues, Comrade Mao Zedong described and demonstrated the war plan formulated by the Communist Party, the tactics and strategy of the Chinese people's army, the basic requirements for guerrilla movements, and the issue of establishing people's power in base areas and behind enemy lines. The author emphasized the great significance of moral and political factors in the war, and pointed out the role of the Chinese Communist Party—the organizer and leader of the masses of the people.
    ×××
    The second volume publishes Comrade Mao Zedong's famous work "On Contradiction" familiar to Soviet readers (please refer to the ninth and tenth issues of the "Bolshevik" magazine in 1952).
    This work of Comrade Mao Zedong was written in August 1937. Its main focus is aimed at dogmatism and bookishness, and at narrow empiricism. At the beginning of this work, the author pointed out that the Soviet philosophers' crushing of the Menshevik idealism gave the Chinese Communists great help in their struggle against dogmatism.
    Based on historical facts and materials from China, and based on the history of the Chinese Communist Party, closely combined with the actual tasks of political struggle, the author studied the core of Marxist dialectics—the law of contradiction is the source of development. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The law of contradiction in things, that is, the law of unity of opposites, is the fundamental law of nature and society, and therefore also the fundamental law of thinking. It is opposed to the metaphysical view of the universe. It is a great revolution in the history of human understanding." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II, Chinese Edition, Page 803)
    Guided by the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, Comrade Mao Zedong focused on elucidating the universality and particularity of contradictions, pointed out the necessity of discovering the main link (main contradiction) in the chain of events, examined the position of confrontation in contradictions, and showed that under the socialist system, although contradictions still exist, confrontation has been eliminated. The author wrote that development is caused by internal contradictions, and internal contradictions are the primary cause of the development of things. This internal contradiction generates the movement and development of things. The mutual connection and mutual influence of one thing and other things is the secondary cause of the development of things. The author further clarified that the external cause is the condition of change, the internal cause is the basis of change, and the external cause plays a role through the internal cause.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On Contradiction" helped the Chinese Communist Party ideologically crush dogmatists and empiricists. The author cited countless examples to vividly show the serious harm of dogmatism to revolutionary practice. Comrade Mao Zedong's work itself is an example of the unity of theory and practice. It is a theoretical, Marxist summary of the Chinese people's years of revolutionary struggle for their liberation, and is an independent and creative study of the relationship between theory and practice.
    The works published in the second volume of Selected Works of Mao Zedong are the result of the creative application of Marxism-Leninism under China's special conditions. They are proof of the tremendous organizational activities of the Chinese Communist Party during the difficult days of the enemy's attack, and are proof of the Chinese Communists' iron will, infinite loyalty to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, ardent patriotism, and profound confidence in victory.

    毛泽东选集第二卷
    苏联维·米海耶夫
    外国书籍出版局出版了毛泽东同志论文选集第二卷俄文译本〔注〕。
    刊载在第二卷中的著作都是在一九三七和一九三八年——在中国人民反抗日本侵略者的神圣战争初期写成的。毛泽东同志的著作总结了中国共产党和中国人民在抗日战争这一时期的革命斗争的经验，表明了中国人民斗争的历史意义。中国人民奋起站立在共产党的旗帜下，在粉碎日本帝国主义的斗争中尽到了伟大作用，并取得了反帝反封建的革命的胜利。
    毛泽东同志著作选集第二卷开头是有关一九三七年夏天的著作。
    一九三七年，在中国形成了严重的局面。日本帝国主义者自从一九三一年侵占东北（满洲）后，连年进犯中国内地。到一九三六年底，日本侵略者除东北外，还占领了内蒙古、华北，直接威胁北京。成万日本军队，在铁路沿线、海港及各个战略据点集结，准备向中国内地大举进攻。全中国面临着遭受日本军阀奴役的严重危险。
    在中国所有政党中，只有共产党自始至终，从日本侵入中国的第一天起就为组织反抗日本侵略者而战斗。日本军队侵占东北后不几天，一九三一年九月二十五日，中国共产党、解放区革命政府就号召人民保卫祖国，发出口号：“驱逐日寇海陆空军出中国！”当国民党政府不放一枪，失地千里的时候，中国共产党人就去东北沦陷区组织了人民抗日斗争。从一九三四年起，东北抗日联军就在共产党领导下，在东北作战。
    在共产党号召影响下，中国人民反抗侵略者的要求愈来愈坚决了。一九三五年到一九三七年间，在上海，青岛，天津，北京及其他城市里，发生了无数次工人抗日罢工和蓬蓬勃勃的学生示威运动。但是，蒋介石集团却不顾人民要求，继续其对日本人妥协让步的政策，开枪射杀抗日游行队伍并继续进攻中国红军。蒋介石政府这种叛卖政策便利了日本帝国主义扩大侵略中国。
    一九三七年七月七日，日本军阀制造北京近郊芦沟桥事件，公开对中国人民发动了战争。中国劳动人民以民族解放战争回答了日本帝国主义的非正义的侵略战争。灭亡全中国的危险加速了中国各爱国力量包括中等资产阶级在内的抗日民族统一战线的建立。在人民的压力下，蒋介石统治集团也被迫参加统一战线，但是，后来的事件表明，蒋介石分子采取了两面派态度。
    发表在毛泽东选集第二卷里面的作品的绝大部分，其中包括：“反对日本进攻的方针、办法和前途”，“为动员一切力量争取抗战胜利而斗争”，
    “上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务”，
    “中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”等，都是确定战争性质，统一战线问题，共产党在民族战争中的任务的著作。毛泽东同志在这些著作中详细考察了随着战争的开始而产生的各种问题：那些力量会参加战争？怎样团结这些力量？统一战线由谁来领导？共产党在战争中的作用是怎样的？为了吸引全体人民保卫国家并取得胜利须要采取怎样的政治与经济措施等等。
    毛泽东同志在“反对日本进攻的方针、办法和前途”这一著作中论证了共产党在刚刚开始的战争中的路线。这一路线代表了中国人民的一致要求：坚决抵抗日本帝国主义，驱逐日本帝国主义出中国，动员全国人民参加卫国战争。共产党实行了
    “有力出力，有钱出钱，有枪出枪，有知识出知识”的口号。蒋介石集团采取了和共产党的路线完全对立的路线，他们反对全民战争，实行了反动的消极抗战的政策。
    中国共产党所提出的既符合无产阶级的利益也符合中国人民的利益的路线，反映在抗日救国十大纲领中。在毛泽东同志为宣传鼓动员写的提纲里面叙述了这一纲领。一九三七年八月，中国共产党中央政治局批准了这个提纲。在第二卷里面，这一提纲是以“为动员一切力量争取抗战胜利而斗争”为标题发表的。这一纲领确定了中国共产党在反抗日本侵略者的战争中以及在反对蒋介石反动的、两面派政策的斗争中的任务。
    抗日救国十大纲领的基本要求是全国人民总动员，依靠全中国人民的力量进行战争。纲领中指出：“民力和军力相结合，将给日本帝国主义以致命的打击。民族战争而不依靠人民大众，毫无疑义将不能取得胜利。”（“毛泽东选集”第二卷，中文版，第三○三页）
    纲领中包括各项军事、经济和政治的措施：坚持抗战到底，全国人民总动员、武装人民，在正面战场积极作战并在敌占区广泛开展游击战争，国家制度民主化，减租减息，改善工人和职员待遇，开展国民教育，肃清汉奸卖国贼亲日派投降妥协派，巩固后方。大家都知道，共产党在解放区实施这些办法的结果，保证了人民军队和游击队在军事上的伟大胜利并巩固了统一战线的基础——工人和农民的联盟。
    毛泽东同志在一九三七年到一九三八年写成的著作中不只一次地着重指出，开展统一战线是粉碎日本帝国主义与建立统一的民主共和国的必不可少的条件，并给中国走上光明和伟大的前途开辟道路。中国共产党建议以建立联合政府的方法来巩固国家政权，这一政府和人民有联系并能引导战争取得胜利。抗日战争的人民性确定地提出了整个中国的政治制度必须实行民主化的问题；“……如果战争的目的是直接代表着人民利益的时候，政府越民主，战争就越好进行。……战争的性质决定政府和人民的关系，这是一个历史的原则。”（同上，第三四五页）
    在一九三七年底，国民党当局拒绝广大人民群众参加反对日本侵略者的战争而引起了前线的重大失败，放弃了上海、太原等重要工业城市和战略中心，在这种时候，更加明显地证实了共产党这一方针的正确性。本卷所载毛泽东同志一九三七年十一月在延安党的活动分子会议上的报告提纲——“上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务”中阐述了共产党在这一时期的任务。在报告中指出，战争仍然是片面性质的：只有政府和军队参加了战争，而不要人民群众。毛泽东同志说：“片面抗战是一定要引导战争趋于失败的”（同上，第三四八页）。只有华北地区取得了成功，军队的作战得到了广泛开展的游击战争的支援。在各个解放区建立了各党、各派的民主政权。解放区的实际情况与国民党后方人民的斗争说明了中国正在由片面的战争过渡到人民战争。
    在这一著作中指出：共产党人在为团结一切统一战线的力量而斗争中必须看到民族统一战线各个部分的区别，并适应这种情况规定自己的政策，确立自己对待民族统一战线中的各个参加者的态度。共产党把当时统一战线的成份分为：左翼集团——共产党所领导的人民群众：无产阶级，农民和城市小资产阶级群众；中间集团——民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级；右翼集团——大地主和大资产阶级。毛泽东同志当论及右翼代表人物时说道：“这是民族投降主义的大本营。一方面害怕战争对于他们的财产的破坏，另一方面害怕民众的起来，他们的投降倾向是必然的。”（同上，第三五七页）中国共产党为战胜敌人揭穿了右翼的投降妥协派，巩固了统一战线中的左翼，从而就加强了整个民族统一战线。
    动员千百万群众参加保卫祖国的战争，结束国民党右派的反动政策，奠定政治制度民主化的基础，以便取得战争的胜利——这就是毛泽东同志在他的著作中反复论证的，中国共产党从战争经验中得出的第一个结论。为了胜利地完成这一任务，就要巩固共产党能够领导中国人民斗争的唯一的力量。
        ×××
    中国共产党在抗日解放战争的最初的日子里，明确地规定了每一共产党员在战争造成的新情况下的任务和义务。党驳斥了各种机会主义的企图，他们拒绝利用已经出现的可能性以便更广泛地开展合法斗争，动员群众和巩固自己的阵地，党也斥责了机会主义分子所提出的要共产党服从国民党集团支配的要求。国民党集团的目的在于限制共产党的活动范围，削弱人民的爱国运动。
    在毛泽东同志的这些著作里表明了马克思主义关于党，关于党的组织原则与思想原则的学说的胜利。和马克思主义的要求完全一致，毛泽东同志在一九三七年十一月说道：“‘左’倾关门主义仍然要防止。但是在同时，在一切统一战线工作中必须密切地联系到独立自主的原则。”（同上，第三五四页）
    作者在“论持久战”著作（一九三八年五月）中说明，中国人民一定要胜利，因为中国有伟大的力量——战斗的共产党，有党所领导的革命的人民的军队，因为有蓬勃开展的全国一切进步力量。中国共产党对于不可战胜的人民群众的力量的不可动摇的信心，解放战争任务的正义性，善于在中国具体条件下运用马克思主义，促进了民族统一战线的巩固，并团结群众在共产党周围。
    发表在第二卷中的毛泽东同志在一九三八年十月在中央委员会全体会议上所作的报告——“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”同样阐明了党的新任务。全体会议批准了这一报告所阐述的党中央政治局的路线，为争取共产党及其所有地方组织的独立自主而斗争的路线，反对迁就国民党，反对阶级投降主义的路线。全体会议确定共产党当时的主要任务是在战区及敌后进行独立自主的工作，发动游击战争。这一报告表明了中国人民所进行的战争的正义性，它对于动员共产党员，全国爱国力量参加长期战争具有重大意义，它给每一个共产党员指出了他在卫国战争中的地位。保卫祖国反对日本侵略是共产党员的义务，因为在解放战争的条件下共产党员只有这样，才能实现他的国际主义的义务。“中国是被侵略的国家。因此，中国共产党人必须将爱国主义和国际主义结合起来。……中国胜利了，侵略中国的帝国主义者被打倒了，同时也就是帮助了外国的人民。因此，爱国主义就是国际主义在民族解放战争中的实施。”（同上，第四八三页）
    党在那些严重的日子里要求每一党员都要表现出英勇牺牲，百折不挠的精神，要善于和群众合作。毛泽东同志在报告中说：“共产党员在八路军和新四军，应该成为英勇作战的模范，执行命令的模范，遵守纪律的模范，政治工作的模范和内部团结统一的模范。……应该言必信，行必果，不傲慢，诚心诚意地和友党友军商量问题，协同工作……”
    （同上，第四八四页）。
    党号召共产党员戒骄戒傲为人民服务，要求每一共产党员成为民众的朋友和教师，而不是官僚主义的政客，要求个人利益服从民族的和人民群众的利益。毛泽东同志在报告中提醒共产党员说，共产党员不过是几万万中国人民的先锋队。“必须懂得，——毛泽东同志说，——共产党员不过是全民族中的一小部分，党外存在着广大的先进分子和积极分子，我们必须和他们协同工作。”（同上，第四八四页）
    毛泽东同志说，共产党员为了要发挥先锋队的作用，带领人民前进，必须不断学习成为实事求是和远见卓识的模范，指出理论知识帮助我们不致丧失前进的方向。共产党员“应成为学习的模范，他们每天都是民众的教师，但又每天都是民众的学生。只有向民众学习，向环境学习，向友党友军学习，了解了他们，才能对于工作实事求是，对于前途有远见卓识。”（同上，第四八五页）
    共产党的先锋队作用是和党在战争中以及在统一战线中的领导作用相符合的。但是，并不是所有的人都懂得这个道理。从战争开始以及跟国民党重新合作第一天起，共产党就不得不进行顽强的斗争来反对党内的投降主义者。他们主张共产党服从国民党，并把统一战线中的领导权交给资产阶级。这种投降主义的路线具体表现在“一切通过统一战线”的政策上，表现在取消共产党的独立自主原则上，表现在对国民党企图削弱共产党的阴谋采取迁就态度上。
    当时有些共产党员（王明等）主张把统一战线中、革命中的领导权让给资产阶级。毛泽东同志在报告中揭穿右倾机会主义的理论根源，尖锐地提出了在为争取中国的自由独立而斗争中坚持以共产党为首的无产阶级领导权问题。毛泽东同志指出，右倾机会主义错误的根源是一部分党员理论水平低，许多党员缺乏跟其他党派合作的经验，党内存在着小资产阶级的成份等等。毛泽东同志说，共产党及其武装力量在统一战线中同别人合作，同时必须保持自己的组织上和政治上的独立性。投降主义——变相的右倾机会主义是当时的主要危险，因此党采取了坚决的手段，彻底肃清了投降主义。
    共产党使自己的活动既服从祖国的利益，在行动上和其他党派合作，又保持了统一战线队伍的独立性，自己的组织上的独立自主原则。正是这种方法帮助党巩固了党和群众的联系。
    共产党在人民中的影响的提高以及它在战争中的先锋队作用，要求共产党员提高理论水平，要求培养与教育党的干部。同时培养与教育非党干部也具有重要的意义。毛泽东同志说：党外存在着很多的人材，共产党不能把他们置之度外。去掉孤傲习气，善于和非党干部共事，真心诚意地帮助他们，用热烈的同志的态度对待他们，把他们的积极性组织到抗日和建国的伟大事业中去，这是每一个共产党员的责任。
    毛泽东同志在报告中接着谈到巩固党的纪律和党内民主问题。他指出：如果党内没有巩固的纪律，不实行少数服从多数的原则，不保证党内的民主，不进行认真的理论学习，就不可能培养大批干部。“马克思列宁主义的伟大力量，就在于它是和各个国家具体的革命实践相联系的。对于中国共产党说来，就是要学会把马克思列宁主义的理论应用于中国的具体的环境。”（同上，第四九七页）
    团结的，老练的，在为争取马克思主义的胜利进行了十七年之久的斗争中锻炼出来的中国共产党，参加了民族解放战争。正如毛泽东同志所讲的一样，它变成了中国人民的“坚强的核心”，它保证了抗日战争的胜利以及在战后建设新中国。
        ×××
    中国人民在反抗日本侵略者的民族解放战争中的战争战略与策略问题在毛泽东同志著作选集第二卷中占据着重要的地位。在这些讨论军事问题的论文和讲演里面总结了共产党所领导的为反对中国人民的敌人而进行的武装斗争的经验。
    在毛泽东同志一九三八年五月底至六月初在延安的讲演中提供了关于反对日本帝国主义的战争问题的提起及其进行的方法。在第二卷中以“论持久战”为总标题发表了这些讲演。共产党根据对实际情况的估计，给人民奠定了在长期的持久的战争中取得胜利的信心。它一方面驳斥了急性病患者幻想抗日战争速胜的冒险计划，同时也打击了失败主义者认为中国必败的谬论。
    但是，毛泽东同志说，胜利是不会自己到来的。“……我们承认在中国面前摆着解放和亡国两个可能的前途，两者在猛烈地斗争中。我们的任务在于实现解放而避免亡国。实现解放的条件，基本的是中国的进步，同时，加上敌人的困难和世界的援助。我们和亡国论者不同，我们客观地而且全面地承认亡国和解放两个可能同时存在，着重指出解放的可能占优势及达到解放的条件，并为争取这些条件而努力。”（同上，第四二一页）
    共产党关于中国人民必然胜利的结论乃是建立在对于中日两国力量对比的科学分析的基础上的。共产党是从估计下列事实出发的。日本是一个侵略的帝国主义强国，它有强大的经济和强有力的国家机器。日本社会经济制度的帝国主义性，产生了日本战争的帝国主义性，因此它不可避免地要在战争中失败。还必须估计到：日本国度比中国小，因此它必然感受到人力、军力、财力、物力的不足而经不起对中国的长期的战争。中国共产党同时还指出日本在国际关系方面最后必然陷于孤立。共产党明确承认中国的军事、经济以及一般准备比不上日本。但是，中国共产党是从中国具有决定战争胜败的优越性出发的。日本没有而且也不可能拥有这种优越性。中国进行的是正义的、解放的战争。全体人民都了解战争的目的，英勇牺牲保卫自己的祖国。中国人民拥有强大的进步的力量，这种进步力量的代表首先是共产党，它具有保证反对侵略者的全民战争的正确的领导的能力。
    中国对日本的优越性还有：地大（这就提供了广阔的周旋余地），物博、人多、以及战斗的中国从全世界进步力量方面所得到的广泛的国际援助。“特别是苏联的存在、鼓舞了中国的抗战。空前强大的社会主义的苏联，它和中国是历来休戚相关的。”
    （同上，第四一八页）
    共产党深信中国人民必然获得最后胜利，积极进行反对中国反动派对日本帝国主义投降妥协的政策。这种政策必定失败，因为在中国国内，以及在国际上都存在着阻止这种妥协投降的力量。
    毛泽东同志写道，中国的持久战须经过三个阶段，每个阶段的战略都有自己的特点。第一阶段是敌人进攻与中国防御；第二个阶段是相持阶段，敌人企图固守，而中国则准备反攻；第三阶段是中国的战略反攻与敌人战略退却阶段。
    按照作者的说法，中国军队在第一阶段中所采取的作战形式，主要是正规军的运动战，辅助以游击战和阵地战。第二阶段可叫做战略相持阶段。敌人在达到一定限度的战略进攻终点后，将企图保守占领地，千方百计搜括中国人民。此时在敌人后方中国的爱国者将建立许多游击根据地和地区，粉碎敌人固守的诡计。在第二阶段中在前线仍将有广大的战争，游击战具有主要的意义，而正规军的运动战则起辅助作用。当敌人相当疲惫，中国已经达到具有足够力量可以进入总反攻的时候第三阶段才能来到。游击战争在这一阶段重新又扮演辅助的角色，在战略上配合正规军的运动战和阵地战。
    此外，在“论持久战”著作中还包括一系列关于中国作战的特点以及关于各种作战方法的结论。“论持久战”表明了，犬牙交错的战争是中国作战的特点。
    在日寇占领区的作战使敌人的据点遭到夹击，并封锁了敌人进攻农业区的道路。对侵略者怀抱着无比憎恨的人民支援着敌后战争，有效地打击日本占领者。把日寇强占的城市变成孤岛，四周围是广大游击农业区，在农村中组织军事与政治斗争——这些就是战争的客观进程所提出的任务。
    抗日战争的战略的这种特点反映了中国的特殊情况：解放战争和资产阶级民主革命的发展结合起来了。它首先和构成中国军队和游击队基本群众的千百万农民为土地和民主自由而进行的斗争结合起来了。把反对帝国主义的抗日斗争和人民为争取从国内反动派压迫下获得经济与政治解放的斗争巧妙地结合起来，使共产党在中国人民当中获得了多数并保证了革命胜利。
    毛泽东同志在研究中国军队的作战性质时着重指出和阵地战并立的运动战的巨大作用。他说：“抗日战争的作战形式中，主要的是运动战，其次就要算游击战了。”（同上，第四六一页）
    共产党人根据十年革命战争的丰富经验并估计到中国的特殊条件，论证并且运用了这种运动战战术。他们抛弃了有害的单纯阵地战的战术。共产党人指出，中国军队必须利用中国的两个极其重大的优越条件：土地广大和兵员众多，这种优越条件保证有可能运用灵活的运动战形式。这种作战形式要求军队有进攻性，出其不意袭击敌人，要求最大的流动性，集中中国军队几个师兵力对付敌人一个师，要求各路同时出击，在行进中作战等等。担任进行运动战的部队如果能得到游击队的协同作战更容易能取得胜利。
    毛泽东同志充分估计到游击战争的重大作用，主张从中国正规军中间，至少指定数十万人，分散在一切敌占区。发动和配合民众武装，进行游击战争。大家都知道：中国共产党实行了这个计划，到一九四五年，在中国人民解放军担负运动战的地区里，在中国共产党领导下有两百多万游击队对敌作战。
    中国共产党从来都特别注意到游击战争问题。第二卷发表了毛泽东同志的有名的著作：“抗日游击战争的战略问题”（一九三八年五月）。这一著作批驳了轻视游击战争的作用的观点，对于在党的领导下建立广大游击部队，以游击战争的方法训练正规军起了重大的作用。
    在中国的特殊条件下，游击战是一种离开中国正规军作战地区很远的，独立的作战。“战争的长期性，随之也是残酷性，规定了游击战争不能不做许多异乎寻常的事情，于是根据地的问题，向运动战发展的问题等等也发生了。于是中国抗日的游击战争，就从战术范围跑了出来向战略敲门……”（同上，第三六六页）。
    毛泽东同志在其阐明军事问题的各种著作中叙述并论证了共产党所制定的战争计划，中国人民的军队的战术战略，对游击运动的基本要求，在根据地和敌后建立人民政权问题。作者着重指出道义上和政治上的因素在战争中的巨大意义，指出中国共产党——人民群众的组织者和领袖——的作用。
    ×××    
    第二卷发表了为苏联读者所熟悉的毛泽东同志的有名的著作“矛盾论”（请参看“布尔什维克”杂志一九五二年九期和十期）。
    毛泽东同志的这一著作是在一九三七年八月写成的，它的主要锋芒是对准着教条主义和书呆子习气，对准着狭隘的经验主义的。作者在这一著作的开头指出了，苏维埃哲学家粉碎孟什维克的唯心主义给中国共产党人在其反对教条主义的斗争中以巨大的帮助。
    作者根据中国历史的事实材料，根据中国共产党历史，紧紧结合政治斗争的实际任务，研究了马克思主义辩证法的核心——矛盾律是发展的源泉。毛泽东同志说道：“事物矛盾的法则，即对立统一的法则，是自然和社会的根本法则，因而也是思维的根本法则。它是和形而上学的宇宙观相反的。它对于人类的认识史是一个大革命。”（“毛泽东选集”第二卷，中文版，第八○三页）
    毛泽东同志以马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的学说为指南，着重阐明了矛盾的普遍性及其特殊性，指出了发现事件链条的主要环节（主要矛盾）的必要性，考察了对抗在矛盾中的地位，表明了在社会主义制度下，矛盾虽仍然存在，但对抗却消灭了。作者写道，发展是由内部矛盾引起的，内部矛盾是事物发展的第一位的原因。这种内部矛盾产生了事物的运动和发展。一事物和其他事物的互相联系和互相影响则是事物发展的第二位的原因。作者进一步阐明外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，而外因则是通过内因而起作用。
    毛泽东同志的著作“矛盾论”帮助了中国共产党在思想上粉碎教条主义者和经验主义者。作者举出无数例证生动地表明教条主义对革命实践的严重的危害性。毛泽东同志这一著作本身就是理论与实践统一的范例，是中国人民争取自己解放的多年革命斗争的理论上的、马克思主义的总结，是对于实践的理论的相互关系的独立的创造性的研究。
    发表在毛泽东同志选集第二卷里面的著作是在中国的特殊条件下创造性地运用马克思主义—列宁主义的结果，是中国共产党在敌寇进攻的严重的日子里所做的巨大的组织活动的明证，是中国共产党人的钢铁意志，对中国人民解放事业的无限忠诚，热烈的爱国主义以及对胜利的深刻信心的明证。
