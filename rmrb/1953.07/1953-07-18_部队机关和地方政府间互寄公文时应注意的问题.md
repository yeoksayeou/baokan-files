    Issues to be Noticed When Official Documents are Exchanged Between Military Units and Local Governments
        (I)
    Yuan Guang from the Civil Affairs Section of Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, writes: We often receive letters from military units and revolutionary soldiers, some asking us to forward them to the families of martyrs and soldiers, and some asking us to help the families of martyrs and soldiers solve problems. However, some letters do not clearly state the addresses of the relevant families of martyrs and soldiers, which causes difficulties in our work and losses to the families of martyrs and soldiers.
    Taking June of this year as an example, we received a total of twenty-six letters from military units and revolutionary soldiers, half of which did not specify the recipient's address. We estimated the situation and forwarded some letters to various districts, but the districts could not find the recipients either. For example, Comrade Guo Zhengji from a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army (later transferred to Changning County, Yunnan Province) sent 125,000 yuan on April 15th of this year, instructing us to forward it to his family. Because the address of his family was not clearly written in the letter, we have not been able to find his family despite repeated inquiries and announcements at expanded cadre meetings throughout the county. In addition, we also have forty-six certificates of revolutionary soldiers, eighteen certificates of sacrifice of revolutionary soldiers, and twelve merit commendations sent by the military units last year, seven of which had the wrong district and village names, and the rest did not specify the family addresses. These letters cannot be delivered to this day, causing these military families to not receive preferential treatment and the families of martyrs to not be properly settled. (Editor's note: The Civil Affairs Section of Jincheng County should quickly contact the sending military unit to find out the recipient's address and deliver the letters immediately).
    In order to reduce or eliminate this phenomenon, it is suggested that when military units or revolutionary soldiers entrust local governments to forward letters to the families of martyrs and soldiers, they must clearly write the recipient's address and name. If there are changes in the district divisions and names of the hometowns of military families, they should also promptly notify the revolutionary soldiers in order to maintain contact.
    (II)
    Pei Ziqing from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army writes: We often receive letters from local governments and the people asking about the whereabouts of revolutionary soldiers, requesting certificates of revolutionary soldiers or certificates of sacrifice of revolutionary soldiers, etc. However, some letters from local government agencies often do not clearly state the unit number of the revolutionary soldiers concerned, and some even only specify the division or regiment number, which makes it difficult for the receiving military unit to find them. For example, a certain county recently wrote to inquire about a comrade named "Liu Bin," but the letter did not specify the comrade's home address and unit number (only stating which regiment); as a result, we found three people in this regiment who were originally from this county and were all called "Liu Bin." In addition, there was also a "Liu Bin" on the list of martyrs, which makes it impossible for us to determine which one the county is inquiring about.
    I suggest that when governments at all levels write to the military to find revolutionary soldiers, they should write the unit number as detailed and specific as possible (at least the company number), and state when this revolutionary soldier was in this unit, and also write the soldier's family, address, and place and time of enlistment. In this way, not only will it be convenient for the receiving military unit to find them, but even if the person to be found has been transferred to another job, it may be easy to find them based on the registration or by asking the old comrades of the unit.
    Editor's note: We have recently received many letters reflecting the above two situations. Now we have selected and published two letters from readers Yuan Guang and Pei Ziqing, hoping that all military units, local governments, and revolutionary soldiers and their families will pay attention.

### 部队机关和地方政府间互寄公文时应注意的问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    部队机关和地方政府间互寄公文时应注意的问题
        （一）
    山西省晋城县民政科原广来信：我们经常收到部队机关和革命军人来信，有的要我们代转给烈、军属，有的让我们替烈、军属解决问题。但是，有些信却没有把有关烈、军属的地址写清楚，使我们工作发生困难，烈、军属也受了损失。
    以今年六月份为例，我们共收到部队机关和革命军人来信二十六件，其中就有半数来信没有写明收件人地址。其中有些信经我们估计情况转往各区，但区里也找不到。如解放军某团郭正基同志（后转到云南昌宁县工作）于本年四月十五日寄来十二万五千元钱嘱代转给他的家属，因为信中没有把他家属的地址写清楚，虽经我们多次查询并在全县扩大干部会上宣布，至今仍未找到他的家属。此外，我们还存有去年部队寄来的革命军人证明书四十六份、革命军人牺牲证明书十八份、立功喜报十二份，其中有七份是写错了区、村名字的，其余的则是没有写明家属地址的。这些信至今无法投送，致使这些军属得不到优待，烈属得不到安置。（编者按：晋城县民政科应该迅速和寄件部队联系，查明收件人地址，立即投送）。
    为了减少或消除这种现象，建议各部队机关或革命军人在托地方政府转信给烈、军属时，务须写清收件人地址和姓名。各地军属遇家乡区划、名称有变动时，亦应迅速通知革命军人，以便保持联系。
    （二）
    解放军某部裴梓清来信：我们经常接到地方政府和人民群众来信寻找革命军人下落、索取革命军人证明书或革命军人牺牲证明书等。但有些地方政府机关来信中往往不把有关革命军人所在部队的番号写清楚，甚至有的只写明其所在师或团的番号，这就使收信的部队机关很难查找。如最近某县来信查一个叫做“刘斌”的同志，但信中没写明这位同志的家庭地址和部队番号（只写在何团）；结果我们在这个团内就查出三个原籍是这一县而且都叫“刘斌”的人，此外在烈士登记表上还有一个“刘斌”，这就使我们无法确定该县查询的究竟是那一个。
    我建议：各级地方政府写信给部队查找革命军人时，要把所在部队的番号尽可能写得详细具体（至少要写明连的番号），并说明这个革命军人什么时候在这个部队，同时还要写明这个军人的家庭、地址和参军地点、时间。这样，不但收信的部队机关查找方便，即使要找的人已经调工作了，根据登记或询问部队的老同志也就可能很容易查出来。
    编者按：我们最近连续收到不少反映上述两种情况的来信。现在我们选择发表了读者原广和裴梓清的两封来信，希望各部队机关、地方政府以及革命军人和革命军人家属们注意。
