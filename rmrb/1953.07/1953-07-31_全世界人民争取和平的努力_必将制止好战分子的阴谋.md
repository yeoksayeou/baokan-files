    The Efforts of People All Over the World to Strive for Peace
    Will Inevitably Stop the Conspiracies of the Warmongers
    A letter from the CPC Haidian District Committee Office in Beijing: Farmers in Haidian District were extremely happy to hear the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Cai Shuzhen, a primary school student from Beixin Village, heard the news at school and happily told acquaintances along the way when she returned home; she said: This is a victory for the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army uncles and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army uncles to defend the peaceful lives of children in Korea and children in all countries of the world.
    The farmers all believe that the signing of the armistice agreement is a great happy event. Xu Zongzhou, a military family member from Jiutian Temple, said: "We will continue to work hard to strive for a peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue, and our country's construction will be faster." Yang Xiuzhen, a poor peasant from Jushan Village, said: "From now on, we can use all our strength to build our motherland, how good is that!"
    Even so, the farmers still feel that they must be vigilant to prevent bad people from playing tricks. Wei Quanfu, militia squad leader of Yimuyuan, said: "The Korean War has stopped, which is a good thing that people all over the world have been looking forward to day and night. But that bad guy Syngman Rhee is still against the armistice, and the United States is still condoning Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the armistice. We must not be careless, and we must not think that we can sit back and relax after the armistice agreement is signed; we must strengthen our vigilance to prevent bad people from sabotaging it." Duan Xuhua, a teacher at the Chedaogou Civil School, said: "Although the armistice agreement has been signed, Syngman Rhee will not give up, and he will think of some ways to sabotage it, we must be vigilant." Yang Cai from Beixin Village said: "We must pay attention to the bad guys' tricks to sabotage the armistice; but no matter what, we are prepared, and we will not let their tricks succeed." Rong Hongbin, the militia captain of Yimuyuan, said: "People all over the world are rising up to oppose war and demand peace, and it is impossible for warmongers to start a war; but we must still prevent them from playing tricks."

专栏：读者来信摘要

    全世界人民争取和平的努力
    必将制止好战分子的阴谋
    中共北京市海淀区委会办公室来信：海淀区农民听到朝鲜停战协定签字的消息后，都极为高兴。北辛庄小学生蔡淑珍在学校里听到这个消息，回家时就高兴地把这个好消息告诉沿路的熟人；她说：这是朝鲜人民军叔叔和中国人民志愿军叔叔为了保卫朝鲜的孩子和世界各国的孩子和平生活，英勇斗争的胜利。
    农民们都认为停战协定的签订是一个大喜事。九天庙军属徐宗洲说：“我们继续努力，争取整个朝鲜问题和平解决，咱们中国的建设就会更快了。”巨山村贫农杨秀珍说：“以后咱们就能把全部力量用来建设咱们的祖国了，这多好呀！”
    虽然如此，农民们还觉得必须提高警惕，防止坏人搞鬼。一亩园民兵小队长魏全福说：“朝鲜停战了，这是全世界人民日夜盼望的好事。但是李承晚这坏小子还是反对停战的，美国还在纵容李承晚破坏停战。我们不能麻痹大意，不能以为停战协定签字就高枕无忧啦；还要加强警惕，防止坏人破坏才行。”车道沟民校教员段续华说：“虽然停战协定已经签字了，但是李承晚还不会死心，他还会想一些办法来破坏，我们得提高警惕。”北辛庄杨才说：“我们要留神坏人破坏停战的鬼把戏；但不管怎么样，反正我们是早有准备的，不让它们的诡计成功。”一亩园民兵队长融洪斌说：“世界人民都起来反对战争、要求和平，好战分子想挑起战争也不行了；但是我们还要防止他搞鬼。”
