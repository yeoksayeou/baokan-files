    A Trial Station Facilitating Mass Lawsuits
    There are eight districts in Yanling County, Henan Province. The farthest district from the city is the Fourth District, which is more than 70 li away. The Eighth and Fifth Districts are also 50 li away from the city. If the masses in these three districts want to file a lawsuit, it takes at least two or three days to go to the city. If the defendant does not come, it will take more time and money to issue a summons.

    After the judicial reform, in order to facilitate mass lawsuits, the Yanling County People's Court set up a trial station in Tuncun Village, the central junction of these three districts. On the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month, the county court sends a judge and a bailiff to the trial station to accept cases, rain or shine. Some of those who come to the trial station to file lawsuits are introduced after mediation fails in the district and township, and some come directly without introduction. It is naturally good if both parties are present, and if one party is absent, the bailiff is sent to summon them. It is stipulated that the time for handling cases at the trial station is three days.

    The trial station handles cases in the following ways: 1. Handle cases as they come. Because the countryside is scattered and the masses are busy with production and cannot wait for collective mediation, this method is adopted. 2. Collective mediation. When there are many cases and they cannot be handled one by one, this method is adopted. 3. For difficult problems that cannot be handled at the trial station, the parties are first asked to return home, and then the judge goes to the local area to handle them three days later, temporarily absorbing cadres and the masses to mediate or sit as jurors. The judge must handle all cases within the scope of the trial station before returning. If the county court needs to study and make a judgment, the case is taken back for judgment, and then brought back to the trial station for disposal next time. The work of the trial station has now become a system, and when the court is in session, the parties can go to the station to await processing. Since its establishment in January this year, the station has accepted at least six or seven cases and as many as twenty cases each time.

    The trial station relies on the masses to handle cases, and the masses are satisfied. On the morning of May 13, the station received four divorce cases. The trial station purposefully selected the case of Kang Wang and Zhao Qinni from Kangzhuang Village as a typical case to handle. Kang and Zhao married in 1949 and have always had a bad relationship. The woman often lives with her parents and cannot be called back. Based on their situation, the trial station first publicized the Marriage Law, explaining the disadvantages of divorcing when one should not, and that not divorcing when one should also affects production and is not beneficial. Originally, one party was unwilling to divorce, but after persuasion, they voluntarily divorced. The other three cases, after explanation and education, one couple reconciled. This actually played the role of collective mediation.

    A historical dispute in Pengzhuang Village was also handled very well. This case was not originally handled at the station, so the judge went directly to the village and absorbed local cadres and the masses to mediate together. The case was as follows: Peng Yufan and Peng Deyan had been in a dispute over house foundation since the Yellow River flooded. After more than ten mediations by the village and township, the problem was not resolved. Peng Deyan's house foundation had two fen of Peng Yufan's land in the northeast corner. The land was silted up by the Yellow River, and the written agreement was lost, so there was no evidence. This time, everyone's opinion was: Peng Yufan has a house foundation elsewhere and does not need this small piece; Peng Deyan's house foundation is small but he has a lot of land, so he can exchange land for the house foundation, which is convenient for both parties. According to this opinion, after persuading both parties to agree, Peng Deyan used half a mu of land to exchange for two fen of house foundation, and the problem was satisfactorily resolved. The village cadres received great help in their work. The masses also said that this handling was beneficial to both parties and there was no need to be angry anymore.

    Since the establishment of the trial station, by the end of May, 110 cases have been handled, involving 220 parties. If we calculate that each case would take an average of two days of work per person to handle in the county, it would be about 440 workdays. Calculating each workday at ten jin of grain, that would be 4,400 jin of grain. Therefore, the establishment of the trial station is of great benefit to production. Not only that, but since the establishment of the station, there have been no civil or criminal backlogs in these three districts. At the same time, it has also clearly established the confidence of cadres in relying on the masses to handle cases.

    The masses praised the People's Government for doing a good thing for them. They said: When Chiang Kai-shek was here, "The yamen gate faces south, those with reason but no money should not enter." The people were often wronged and had nowhere to complain. Now, without spending a penny, the masses are helped with major issues. Cadres are willing to travel more so that the masses do not have to travel so much, truly serving the masses!

    Of course, there are still many shortcomings in the work of the trial station. The leadership has not grasped it tightly enough and has not summarized the work in a timely manner to raise the trial station to a circuit court. At the same time, it has not made good use of going to the countryside to handle cases to抓up mediation work in a planned way. These all need to be improved in the future.

### 一个便利群众诉讼的审判站

    一个便利群众诉讼的审判站
    河南省鄢陵县有八个区，离城最远的是四区，有七十多里，八区和五区也离城五十多里。这三个区的群众要诉讼，进城一趟就起码耽搁两三天时间；如果被告不来，要下传票，耽误的时间和花费就更多了。
    在司法改革以后，鄢陵县人民法院为了便利群众诉讼，在这三个区的中心结合部——屯沟村设立了一个审判站。每月旧历初一、十五，县法院派一审判员带法警一人到审判站去受理案件，风雨无阻。来到审判站诉讼的，有的是经区乡调解不了介绍来的，有的是没有经过介绍直接来的。双方当事人都到，自然很好，一方不到，就派法警去传讯。规定一次在审判站处理案件的时间是三天。
    审判站处理案件的方法有以下几种：一、随到随处理。农村分散，群众又忙于生产，不能等待作集体调解，就采用这种办法。二、集体调解。案件多，一个一个处理不过来，就采用这种办法。三、在审判站处理不了的疑难问题，就先叫当事人回去，再由审判员在三天以后，到当地去处理，临时吸收干部和群众来调解或陪审。审判员在审判站范围内，要不定期地把所有案件处理了再回去。需要县法院研究判决的，带回去判决以后，下次再带回审判站来发落。审判站工作现在已经成为一种制度，每到开庭的时候，当事人就能到站听候处理。这个站从今年元月份建立以来，每次接受的案件少者六、七件多者二十多件。
    审判站依靠群众办案，群众感到满意。五月十三日上午，站上接到四件离婚案。审判站有目的地选择康庄村康旺与赵钦妮一案为典型来处理。康与赵从一九四九年结婚，一贯感情不好，女的常住在娘家，叫也叫不回去。根据他们的情况，审判站首先宣传婚姻法，说明不该离而离的坏处，该离而不离也同样影响生产，没有好处。原来有一方不愿离婚，最后经过说服才自愿离婚。另外三件，经过解释教育，有一对重新和好了。这实际上起了集体调解的作用。
    在彭庄村有一件历史纠纷处理得也很好。这一案原来在站上没处理了，审判员就直接到这个村上去，吸收当地干部和群众共同调解。案件情况是这样：彭玉范与彭德彦从黄水泛滥以后，为了宅基纠纷，经村乡十多次调解，未得到解决。彭德彦宅基东北角内有彭玉范宅地二分，黄水冲淤住了，又失去文约，无凭据。这次大家意见是：彭玉范别处有宅基，用不着这一小片；彭德彦宅基少而土地多，可用地换宅基，两下都便利。按照这个意见，说服双方同意后，彭德彦用半亩地换二分宅基，问题圆满解决了。村干部工作上得到了很大帮助。群众也说这样处理双方都有利，再不用生气了。
    审判站建立以后，到五月底，处理案件一百一十起，共有当事人二百二十人。如果统计一下，每一案件要到县里处理，平均每人花两天功夫，大约要误四百四十个工，每工按十斤粮算，就是四千四百斤粮。因此建立审判站对生产有很大好处。不但这样，自建站以后，这三个区根本没有民事、刑事方面的积案。同时，也明确树立了干部依靠群众办案的信心。
    群众称赞人民政府给他们办了一件好事。他们说：蒋介石在这里时，“天下衙门朝南开，有理无钱莫进来”，人民往往是冤沉海底，没处伸诉。现在一分钱不花，给群众办了大事。干部愿多跑路，不让群众多跑路，真是为群众服务的！
    当然审判站工作也还有不少缺点。领导方面抓得不紧，没有及时总结工作，把审判站提高成为巡回法庭。同时，也没有很好地通过下乡办案，有计划地把调解工作抓起来。这都需要在今后加以改进。
