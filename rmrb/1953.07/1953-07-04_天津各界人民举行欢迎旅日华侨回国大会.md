Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 3rd: Tianjin held a grand rally at the Chinese Theater on the afternoon of the 3rd with over two thousand people from all walks of life in Tianjin to welcome overseas Chinese returning from Japan.

At the start of the rally, Wang Xiaoyi, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the people of Tianjin to the returning overseas Chinese. He reported to the overseas Chinese that since liberation, Tianjin has undergone fundamental changes in all aspects. Not only has industrial and commercial production fully recovered and the market is increasingly prosperous, but also from this year onwards, it has begun to enter a period of national planned construction together with the whole country.

Following this, Zhuang Xiquan, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, delivered an earnest welcoming speech. He pointed out that the heroic action of the overseas Chinese in Japan in striving to return to the country demonstrates to the world that no conspiracy or trick of any reactionaries can dispel the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese compatriots, and no unreasonable oppression by any reactionaries can sever the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Chinese compatriots and the motherland. Overseas Chinese are spread all over the world, but no matter where they are, no matter how far apart they are, their hearts are always linked to the people of the motherland. The relationship between them and the people of the motherland is as close as between brothers and sisters.

Fan Zizhao, a representative of the returning overseas Chinese, expressed his gratitude for the care and welcome from the people of the motherland in his reply. He said: "What we have seen and heard in the past two days has been nothing short of amazement and joy. We must work hard to learn from the people of the motherland and contribute our greatest strength to participate in the construction of our great motherland."

After the meeting, the Chongqing Skills Troupe and the Tianjin People's Art Theater performed wonderful consolation programs. The returned overseas Chinese were very interested in the excellent folk art and acrobatics of the motherland. Each program was performed amidst warm applause, and some programs were repeated at the request of the audience.

Finally, as the returned overseas Chinese left the venue amidst warm applause, the masses cheered enthusiastically wherever they passed, vying to come forward to meet them.

    天津各界人民举行欢迎旅日华侨回国大会
    【新华社天津三日电】天津市各界人民二千余人，三日下午在中国戏院举行盛大的欢迎旅日华侨回国大会。
    大会首先由天津市人民政府秘书长王笑一代表天津市人民向回国华侨致欢迎词。他对华侨报告，解放以来，天津市各方面都起了根本的变化，不但工商业生产完全恢复，市面日益繁荣，而且从今年起与全国一道开始进入了国家有计划地建设时期。
    接着，中央人民政府华侨事务委员会副主任委员庄希泉发表了恳切的欢迎词。他指出，旅日华侨这次争取回国的英勇行动向全世界说明：任何反动派的阴谋诡计都打消不了中国侨胞的爱国热情，任何反动派的无理压迫都隔断不了中国侨胞和祖国的血肉关系。华侨遍布世界上每一个角落，但不管天南地北，不管相隔十万八千里，他们和祖国人民始终是心连着心。他们和祖国人民之间的关系像亲兄弟亲姊妹一般的亲切。
    回国华侨代表范子肇在答词中对祖国人民的关怀和欢迎表示感谢。他说：“两天来所看到的和所听到的，没有一件事情不使我们惊异，也没有一件事情不使我们高兴。我们要努力向祖国人民学习，拿出最大的力量来参加伟大祖国的建设工作。”
    会后，由重庆技艺团和天津市人民艺术剧院演出精彩的慰问节目。归侨们对祖国出色的民间艺术和杂技很感兴趣，每一个节目都在热烈的掌声中进行，有的节目应观众的要求重演了一遍。
    最后，归侨们在热烈的掌声中离开会场时，他们所经过的地方，群众都热烈欢呼，争着上前和他们见面。
