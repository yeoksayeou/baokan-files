    Commemorating the 27th Anniversary of the Death of Dzerzhinsky
    You. Salapafu
    Twenty-seven years ago, on July 20, 1926, the fiery heart of Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky, the great revolutionary, outstanding activist of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, stopped beating.
    Comrade Stalin, in describing the entire life path of Dzerzhinsky, wrote: "Knowing no rest, not shirking any difficult work, bravely fighting difficulties, overcoming them, dedicating all his strength and all his energy to the cause entrusted to him by the Party. He exhausted himself for the benefit of the proletariat, for the victory of communism."
    From his youth, Felix Dzerzhinsky embarked on the arduous path of revolutionary struggle against social injustice. In the seventh grade of middle school, he was a member of a social democratic group, and a year later, he himself was conducting Marxist propaganda among workers. In 1895, eighteen-year-old Felix joined the Social Democratic Labor Party. At that time, the irresistible flame of revolutionary struggle that burned in Dzerzhinsky's heart could not be extinguished by any force. From that time on, his entire life belonged indivisibly to the great class—the proletariat and the Communist Party.
    In April 1906, Dzerzhinsky was already a delegate to the Fourth (Unification) Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. Here, he met Lenin and Stalin. This was an exciting event in the life and revolutionary activities of Felix Edmundovich.
    The Tsarist government cruelly persecuted Dzerzhinsky. Prisons and exile, escapes and re-imprisonment; further escapes and renewed hard labor—this was Dzerzhinsky's harsh life, full of incredible ordeals, before 1917.
    The February Revolution liberated Dzerzhinsky from the Tsar's shackles, and he, regardless of his illness, devoted himself to the work of the Party. The Bolsheviks in Moscow elected him as a delegate to the Sixth Party Congress. This congress led the Party to armed uprising. This congress resolutely opposed Lenin being brought to trial. Following J.V. Stalin, F.E. Dzerzhinsky spoke at the meeting. The congress supported his fervent speech protecting Lenin. The life of Lenin, which was extremely precious to the Party, the Soviet people, and all mankind, was saved. At the Sixth Party Congress, Dzerzhinsky was elected as a member of the Central Committee, and then continuously re-elected as a member of the Central Committee until his death.
    The historically significant days of the Great October Socialist Revolution arrived. Dzerzhinsky participated in the Party Central Committee's organization that led the uprising. He firmly believed that the working class, led by the Communist Party, would surely achieve victory. Confidence in the creativity of the Russian workers and peasants cultivated Dzerzhinsky's energy, his heroism, and his fearless spirit.
    The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution aroused a furious outburst of anger and hatred from domestic counter-revolutionaries and foreign imperialists. The overthrown classes used all their strength to sabotage the revolution, which was supposed to guarantee the interests of workers, laborers, and the exploited classes.
    F.E. Dzerzhinsky, true to his motto: "Action should follow belief," carried out the important assignments of the Party from the very first days of the victory of the armed uprising in Petrograd.
    Shortly after the establishment of the Soviet regime, according to a resolution of the Soviet People's Committee, the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution, Sabotage and Speculation was established. F.E. Dzerzhinsky was appointed as the chairman of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission.
    The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, led by Dzerzhinsky, gave accurate and merciless blows to domestic counter-revolutionaries. The glorious Soviet "Chekists," in their noble work, relied on the help and support of the broad masses of workers and peasants, uncovered the most complex anti-Soviet conspiracies, and resolutely stopped all the enemies' plots.
    The working people of the entire Soviet state showed a high degree of vigilance in helping the Soviet "Chekists." The daughter of a foreign spy dropped a roll of secret military maps that she was carrying, which were prepared to be handed over to the headquarters of the White Guard General Yudenich, on the streets of Petrograd. A Red Army soldier caught her and handed her over to the organs of the Extraordinary Commission. The spy, who was later arrested, claimed that he was discovered by chance. Dzerzhinsky refuted this claim, saying: "Your daughter accidentally dropped a roll of paper, but that Red Army soldier did not accidentally pick it up, nor did he accidentally arrest her. The vigilance possessed by an ordinary Red Army soldier is not accidental. The strength of the Extraordinary Commission lies here."
    To always be with the people, to rely on the people in work, to deeply understand that the work of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission serves the interests of the people—F.E. Dzerzhinsky taught in this way, and he educated the Soviet "Chekists" in this way, he himself was an example of steadfastness and calmness, a model of treating his duties with a high degree of ideology and principle and with a Party attitude.
    While leading the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, F.E. Dzerzhinsky accepted the Party's assignment and appeared more than once on the most dangerous fronts of the civil war. At the end of 1918, a serious situation arose on the Eastern Front. On Lenin's suggestion, the Party Central Committee sent Stalin and Dzerzhinsky there. By January 1919, the soldiers of the Eastern Front had already switched to a successful offensive.
    In the spring of 1920, Dzerzhinsky carried out enormous work on the Southwestern Front. He served as the commander of the rear of the front, and established stable revolutionary order in the rear of the combat troops.
    Love for children was a prominent characteristic of F.E. Dzerzhinsky. After he became chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee's Special Commission for the Improvement of Children's Lives in January 1921, he actively launched the work of rescuing homeless children, and until his death, he was particularly concerned about children.
    Because of his care, the children also repaid Dzerzhinsky with deep gratitude and love. They wrote letters to Dzerzhinsky from all over the country, reporting on their own living and production work.
    After driving out the foreign armed interventionists and defeating the domestic counter-revolutionaries, the working people of the Soviet state entered the period of restoring the damaged national economy.
    In April 1921, F.E. Dzerzhinsky was appointed as the People's Commissar of Railways. At the same time, he continued to lead the work of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission—the State Political Directorate. The Party entrusted Dzerzhinsky with leading the labor heroism of railway workers to the work of restoring the country's railway lines. Thus, Dzerzhinsky again dedicated all his organizational genius to the new work. The three years of Dzerzhinsky's management of transportation were, for him, a great school for learning economic leadership, a training class for managing the entire national economy of the Soviet Union. In 1924, the Party appointed Dzerzhinsky as the Chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy of the Soviet Union.
    At that time, the Party had already put forward to the working masses of the Soviet state the historically significant task of building socialism. In this regard, the Party started from the principle that socialism could be built in one country, especially in a country like the Soviet Union. The Communist Party firmly believed in the creativity of the Soviet people and called on them to implement the grand program of socialist construction. In the struggle to achieve the Party's line of industrializing the Soviet state, F.E. Dzerzhinsky contributed all his energy, wisdom, and experience. As a long-tested Communist Party member, he relied on the enthusiasm of the working class in this struggle, repeatedly emphasizing that if the tasks facing the Supreme Council of National Economy became the tasks of the broad proletarian masses, they could be accomplished.
    During his time as Chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy, Dzerzhinsky, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, resolutely implemented the line of the great program of socialist industrialization of the country.
    F.E. Dzerzhinsky was a loyal son of the Party, one of the builders of the Party's unity and power. His tireless struggle for the unity of the Party ranks, his irresistible revolutionary energy (which he unreservedly dedicated to the work entrusted to him by the Party), earned him the highest respect of the entire Soviet people, both Party members and non-Party members. Dzerzhinsky's pure image is, for the Soviet people, the embodiment of the Communist Party, which produced and trained this outstanding fighter in the struggle for the happiness of the people.
    The loyal knight of the proletariat, Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky, dedicated his entire life to the cause of the Communist revolution. Felix Dzerzhinsky spent eleven years, that is, almost a quarter of his entire life, in prisons, hard labor, and exile. He dedicated all his heart's blood, drop by drop, to the great cause of the struggle for communism.
    With his entire life, high Party spirit and principle, and purity, he set an inspiring example for millions of builders of communist society.

    纪念捷尔任斯基逝世二十七周年
    尤·萨拉帕夫
    二十七年以前，即一九二六年七月二十日，伟大的革命家、共产党和苏维埃国家的卓越活动家费利克斯·爱德蒙多维奇·捷尔任斯基的火热的心，停止了跳动。
    斯大林同志在说明捷尔任斯基的全部生活道路时写道：“不知道休息，不逃避任何烦难的工作，勇敢地和困难作斗争，克服它们，将自己的全部力量、全部精力贡献于党所委托给他的事业。他为了无产阶级的利益，为了共产主义的胜利，使自己心力交瘁。”
    费利克斯·捷尔任斯基自少年时起，便走上同社会上不公正现象进行革命斗争的艰苦道路。在中学七年级时，他是社会民主主义小组的组员，而在一年以后，他自己已在工人中进行马克思主义的宣传。一八九五年，十八岁的费利克斯加入了社会民主工党。当时，在捷尔任斯基心中所燃起的不可遏止的革命斗争火焰，已非任何力量所能熄灭。自那时起，他的全部生活便不可分割地属于伟大的阶级——无产阶级和共产党了。
    一九○六年四月，捷尔任斯基已是俄国社会民主工党第四次（统一的）代表大会的代表。在这里，他遇到了列宁和斯大林。在费利克斯·爱德蒙多维奇的生活和革命活动中，这是一件令他激动的事件。
    沙皇政府残酷地迫害着捷尔任斯基。监狱和流放，越狱和重新入狱；再越狱和重服苦役——这就是在一九一七年以前捷尔任斯基的严酷的、充满令人难以置信的磨难生活。
    二月革命把捷尔任斯基由沙皇的镣铐中解放出来，而他则不顾自己的疾病，埋头于党的工作。莫斯科的布尔什维克们选他为第六次党代表大会的代表。这次大会把党引向了武装起义。这次大会坚决地反对使列宁到法庭受审。继约·维·斯大林之后，费·爱·捷尔任斯基曾在会上讲话。代表大会支持了他保护列宁的热烈发言。对于党、苏联人民和全人类来说都是十分珍贵的列宁的生命，获得了拯救。在党的第六次代表大会上，捷尔任斯基被选为中央委员会委员，以后并连任中央委员，直至他逝世时止。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的具有历史意义的日子来到了。捷尔任斯基参加了领导起义的党中央的机构。他坚决相信由共产党所领导的工人阶级必将取得胜利。对俄国工人和农民的创造力的确信，培养了捷尔任斯基的精力，他的英雄主义和大无畏的精神。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利引起了国内反革命分子和外国帝国主义者的疯狂忿怒和憎恨的爆发。被推翻的各个阶级运用全部力量来破坏革命，而这个革命则是应当来保证工人、劳动者和被剥削阶级的利益的。
    费·爱·捷尔任斯基忠实于自己的箴言：“行动应当追随着信仰”，他从彼得格勒武装起义胜利的最初日子起，便执行着党的重要的委托。
    在苏维埃政权建立后不久，根据苏维埃人民委员会的决议，建立了全俄肃反委员会，同反革命势力、怠工和投机行为进行斗争。费·爱·捷尔任斯基被任为全俄肃反委员会的主席。
    捷尔任斯基所领导的全俄肃反委员会给了国内反革命分子以准确而无情的打击。光荣的苏维埃“肃反”人员们，在他们的高尚的工作中，依靠了广大工农群众的帮助和支持，查清了最复杂的反对苏维埃的阴谋诡计，坚决地制止了一切敌人的阴谋。
    全体苏维埃国家的劳动人民在帮助苏维埃“肃反”人员中显示了高度的警惕性。一个外国间谍的女儿，把她所携带的、准备转交白卫军尤登尼奇将军总部的一卷秘密军事略图，落在彼得格勒的街头。一个红军捉住了她，并将她交给肃反委员会的机关。那个后来被捕的间谍声称，他所以能被发现乃是一种偶然情况。捷尔任斯基驳斥了这种说法，他说：“你的女儿偶然落下了一卷纸，但是那位红军并非偶然地检起了它，也并非偶然地逮捕了她。一个普通红军所具有的那种警惕性，不会是偶然的。非常委员会的力量就正在这里。”
    要永远和人民在一起，在工作中要依靠人民，要深刻地领会到全俄肃反委员会的工作是为人民的利益服务的——费·爱·捷尔任斯基曾这样教导说，他就是这样地来教育苏维埃“肃反”人员的，他本人便是具有坚毅和镇静精神的榜样，便是以高度思想性和原则性和以党的态度来对待自己职责的模范。
    费·爱·捷尔任斯基在领导全俄肃反委员会的同时，接受党的委托，曾不止一次地出现于国内战争中最危险的战线上。一九一八年底，在东方战线上发生了严重情况。依照列宁的建议，党中央委员会把斯大林和捷尔任斯基派到那里。到了一九一九年一月，东方战线的士兵们就已转入了顺利的进攻。
    一九二○年春天，捷尔任斯基在西南战线上进行了巨大的工作。他担任战线后方司令，在作战部队的后方，建立了稳定的革命秩序。
    热爱儿童是费·爱·捷尔任斯基的显著特点之
    一。他在一九二一年一月担任全俄中央执行委员会改善儿童生活专门委员会的主席以后，他积极地展开了救护流浪儿童的工作，直到逝世时止，他都特别关心着儿童。
    由于他的关怀，儿童们对捷尔任斯基也报以深重的谢意和敬爱。他们从国内各地方写信给捷尔任斯基，报告他们自己的生活和生产工作的情形。
    在驱走国外武装干涉者和战胜国内反革命分子后，苏维埃国家的劳动人民进入了恢复被破坏的国民经济时期。
    一九二一年四月，费·爱·捷尔任斯基被任命为交通人民委员。同时他仍继续领导全俄肃反委员会——国家政治保卫局的工作。党委托捷尔任斯基把铁路工作人员的劳动英雄主义引向恢复国家铁路干线的工作。于是捷尔任斯基又把他的全部组织天才贡献给了新的工作。捷尔任斯基管理交通工作的三年，对他说，就是一个学习经济领导的伟大学校，从事管理苏联全部国民经济工作的训练班。一九二四年党任命捷尔任斯基为苏联最高国民经济会议主席。
    党当时已向苏维埃国家的劳动大众提出了建设社会主义这个具有历史意义的任务。在这方面，党是以在一个国家中，特别是像苏联这样的国家，可以建成社会主义的方针为出发点。共产党坚决相信苏联人的创造力，号召他们来实现宏伟的社会主义建设纲领。在争取实现苏维埃国家工业化这个党的路线的斗争中，费·爱·捷尔任斯基贡献出了他的全部精力、智慧和经验。作为一个久经考验的共产党员，他在这一斗争中依靠了工人阶级的积极性，屡次强调，如果最高国民经济会议所面临的任务将成为广大无产阶级群众的任务，那它们就能够获得完成。
    在担任最高国民经济会议主席时期，捷尔任斯基在党中央委员会领导下，坚决地实行了使国家社会主义工业化的伟大纲领的路线。
    费·爱·捷尔任斯基是党的忠实的儿子，党的团结和威力的建造者之一。他的争取党的队伍团结的不倦斗争，他的不可遏止的革命精力（他曾把这种精力毫无保留地献给了党所委托给他的工作），使他博得了党和非党人员全体苏联人民的最高敬爱。捷尔任斯基纯洁的形象，对苏联人来说，乃是共产党的化身，这个党在争取人民的幸福中，产生和锻炼了这个卓越的战士。
    无产阶级的忠实骑士费利克斯·爱德蒙多维奇·捷尔任斯基把他的整个一生献给了共产主义革命的事业。费利克斯·捷尔任斯基有十一年，即几乎是他全部生活的四分之一，是在监狱、苦役和流放中度过的。他把自己的全部心血，一滴一滴地献给了争取共产主义斗争的伟大事业。
    他以他的全部的生活，高度的党性和原则性、纯洁性，为千百万共产主义社会建设者们树立了令人鼓舞的范例。
