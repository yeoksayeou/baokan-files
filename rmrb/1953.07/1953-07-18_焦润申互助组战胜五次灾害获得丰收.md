Jiao Run Shen is from Jiaocun Village, Huaimiao Town, Second District of Yanshi, Henan. The mutual aid team he leads was only organized last spring. Of the eight households in the group, except for one middle peasant household, all are emancipated peasants who had just been allocated land after liberation. Last autumn, Jiao Run Shen participated in the agricultural observation group organized by the special district. In Luoyang, he listened to the report of the delegation of representatives to the Soviet Union, observed the high-yield fields of provincial first-class labor models He Chengshun and Wu Fuxiang on the spot, and learned their high-yield experiences. From then on, Jiao Run Shen not only recognized the superiority of advanced technology ideologically, but also established the confidence to increase grain production for the country and improve the lives of the team members.

Last winter, the Jiao Run Shen mutual aid team planted a total of twenty-eight mu of wheat. In order to strive for a general bumper harvest, all twenty-eight mu of wheat were planted according to advanced experience. Before planting wheat, all wheat fields were first deeply ploughed. Twelve mu of high-yield land also used tandem plows (double plows), plowing to a depth of eight or nine inches; each mu of wheat field was also applied with seven carts of base fertilizer (three mu of high-yield land was applied with nine carts, plus eighty jin of black beans). When planting, all wheat seeds were selected, soaked, and mixed with pesticides, and close planting was implemented (fifteen to twenty jin of seeds per mu). After the wheat seeds were planted, in addition to carrying out three attacks on time (applying the first fertilizer to promote seedling growth, the second to promote stalk growth, and the third to promote grain formation), they were hoeed once before the New Year and once after the New Year, and weeds were pulled twice, truly achieving the requirement of "fertile soil, clean weeds, and vigorous wheat."

However, the Jiao Run Shen mutual aid team's implementation of these advanced cultivation methods was not smooth sailing. At first, when he proposed to adopt advanced experience in wheat planting, the team members did not agree and had great ideological resistance. Jiao Run Shen thought to himself, how can the production increase plan be completed if the team members resist advanced experience so much? So he used observation, comparison, and on-site education methods to break through the conservative thinking of the team members. For example, when soaking and mixing seeds were implemented last year, the team members did not understand. He led the team member Jiao Leshan to the county farm to see the millet that had been soaked and mixed with pesticides, which grew much more vigorously than the millet that had not been soaked or mixed with pesticides, and there were no diseased plants. In this way, Jiao Leshan realized the benefits of advanced technology for agricultural production, and through his propaganda, he promoted the implementation of soaking and mixing seeds throughout the group. When mobilizing team members to plant densely, everyone's thinking was even more blocked. Team member Jiao Jinliang said: "I dare not plant too densely in the white soil. If it is planted too densely, it will not grow without fertilizer, and too much fertilizer will cause it to fall over." Jiao Run Shen compared the densely planted cotton he planted last year with Jiao Jinliang's sparsely planted cotton. On the same land, his densely planted cotton yielded five bundles per mu, while Jiao Jinliang's only yielded three bundles. After such a comparison, Jiao Jinliang and other team members began to believe that dense planting could yield more, and agreed to implement dense planting when planting wheat.

Since the wheat was planted, Jiao Run Shen has been worried all the time, fearing that the wheat would suffer unexpected disasters. Therefore, in advance, he formulated a wheat field management plan within the team, set up special personnel to be responsible for managing the wheat fields, and to detect insect conditions; and put forward the slogan "treat if there are insects, prevent if there are no insects" to improve everyone's vigilance against insect pests. Unexpectedly, in the first month of this year, red spiders appeared as soon as the wheat started to grow. At first, everyone did not fully understand the harm of red spiders and did not want to find a way to treat them. Jiao Run Shen thought to himself: "If this drags on for a day or two, how can the wheat yield a bumper harvest?" So he took the lead in treating two fen of land with one jin of 666 powder. The next day, he did not mention insect control, but only said that he was going to pull weeds in the field. While pulling weeds, he held the insect-infested wheat leaves to the sun for everyone to see, and explained to everyone: "These white marks on the wheat leaves are all eaten by red spiders. If they eat too much, the wheat leaves will turn yellow, and if the leaves turn yellow, the wheat will die." He also let everyone see that the two fen of wheat land he had treated were really free of insects, and the wheat leaves that had not been treated were covered with red spiders. At this time, everyone realized the harm of red spiders. They borrowed forty jin of 666 powder from the village supply and marketing cooperative, and the whole group mobilized to save the thirteen mu of insect-infested wheat.

As soon as the red spiders were treated, frost fell unexpectedly, and the wheat was beaten as if it had been washed with boiling water. At that time, the team members were pessimistic and disappointed, but Jiao Run Shen was not intimidated by the frost disaster, and actively tried to save the wheat. On the second day after the frost, he went to the wheat field and saw that the one mu of wheat he had watered three days before the frost was hit lightly, and the wheat that had not been watered was hit hard. At that time, he thought that even if the wheat seedlings were killed, the wheat roots would not die, and as long as they were watered and fertilized, they could be saved. So he mobilized the whole group to water the wheat. The thirteen mu of wheat that had been watered the first time looked tender and green again after two days, and the wheat stalks also straightened up! When everyone saw this, their confidence in watering the wheat was even higher, and they generally watered the frost-stricken wheat four to seven times within half a month. After watering, they bought back one hundred and sixty-seven jin of ammonium sulfate and applied topdressing fertilizer. In this way, they overcame the frost disaster.

After the frost disaster, the wheat had just been saved, and some had just begun to develop ears, and sucking insects were found on the wheat stalks; not long after the sucking insects were eliminated, the wheat had only been in bloom for four or five days, and everyone had not yet taken a breath, when strong winds blew continuously for four nights; after the wind disaster, heavy fog fell again. But because they actively sought ways to fight these disasters, the wheat suffered only minor losses. This year, although the wheat in Jiao Run Shen's group suffered five serious disasters in succession, due to their implementation of deep plowing and careful cultivation, reasonable close planting, and processed fertilizer application, and overcoming disasters, they still achieved a bumper harvest. The whole group's twenty-eight mu of wheat yielded more than 8,500 jin, an average of more than 300 jin per mu, an increase of nearly 80% compared with last year (last year, the average yield was 170 jin per mu). Now the whole group is full of confidence in striving for an increase in autumn grain production.

    焦润申互助组战胜五次灾害获得丰收
    孙登祥
    焦润申是河南偃师二区槐庙镇焦村人。他领导的互助组是去年春天才组织起来的。全组八户，除一户中农外都是解放后刚分到土地的翻身农民。去年秋天，焦润申参加了专区组织的农业观摩团，在洛阳听了访苏代表团代表的报告，实地观察了省一等劳动模范贺成顺、吴福祥的丰产地并学习了他们的丰产经验。从这时起，焦润申不但在思想上认识了先进技术的优越性，而且树立了为国家增产粮食、改善组员生活的信心。
    焦润申互助组去年冬天共种二十八亩地的小麦。为了争取普遍丰收，二十八亩小麦都是按照先进经验种植的。在种麦前，首先将所有的麦地全部进行了深耕，十二亩丰产地还使用了套犁（双犁），犁至八、九寸深；每亩麦地又施底肥七车（三亩高额丰产地施了九车，另加黑豆八十斤）。种时小麦全部进行了选种、浸种、拌种，实行了密植（每亩十五斤到二十斤种籽）。麦种上以后，除按时实行三攻（追第一次肥攻苗、第二次攻杆、第三次攻籽）法进行追肥外，年前全部锄了一遍，年后又锄了一遍，拔两次草，真正达到了“地肥草光麦又旺”的要求。
    但焦润申互助组实行这些先进的耕作方法并不是一帆风顺的。开始，当他提出种麦要采用先进经验时，组员都不赞成，思想上抵触很大。焦润申心想组员们对先进经验抵触这样大，怎能完成增产计划呢？于是他就用观摩、对比、实地教育的方法来打通组员的保守思想。如去年种麦实行浸种、拌种时，组员思想不通，他便带领组员焦乐善到县农场去看浸过、拌过种的谷子，比一般没浸、没拌过种的谷子长得旺盛得多，一个病棵也没有。这样焦乐善就认识了先进技术对农业生产的好处，通过他的宣传，推动全组实行了浸种、拌种。在动员组员密植时，大家的思想更不通，组员焦金良说：“白土地不敢种稠了，种稠了没粪不长，粪上多了会倒。”焦润申就拿他去年种的密植棉花和焦金良的稀植棉花对比，都是同样的地，他密植的棉花每亩摘五捆，焦金良的只摘三捆。经过这样的对比，焦金良和其他的组员才开始相信了密植能多收，同意了种麦时实行密植。
    自从小麦种下去以后，焦润申就时时刻刻担心着，怕小麦遭受意外的灾害，因此事先他就在组内订出了麦田管理计划，设专人专责管理麦田，侦察虫情；并提出“有虫就治，没虫就防”的口号，提高大家对虫害的警惕。不料今年正月间麦刚起头就发生了红蜘蛛，开始大家对红蜘蛛的危害认识不足，不想办法治。焦润申心想：“这样一天两天的拖下去，小麦怎能丰产呢？”于是他就自己带头先用一斤六六六粉治了二分地。第二天他也不说治虫，只说去地里拔草，在拔草时，就拿着生虫的麦叶照着太阳让大家看，并向大家解释说：“这麦叶上的白印都是红蜘蛛吃的，吃狠了麦叶就黄，叶一黄麦就死了。”又让大家看他治过的二分麦地真正没有虫了，没有治的麦叶上红蜘蛛都爬的满满的。这时大家才知道红蜘蛛的危害。他们到村供销合作社赊了四十斤六六六粉，全组齐动员，才算把十三亩生了虫的麦救了出来。
    红蜘蛛刚治下，不料又下了霜，打得麦子像被开水洗过的一样。当时组员们都悲观失望，但焦润申却没有被霜灾吓倒，并积极想办法来挽救麦子。在下霜的第二天他去麦地看到他在下霜前三天浇过的一亩多麦打的轻，没浇过的麦子打的重，当时他想就是麦苗打死了，麦根也不会死，只要浇浇再追追肥是会挽救过来的。于是他就动员全组浇麦。第一遍浇过的十三亩麦，两天后看着又嫩又绿，麦棵也直起来啦！大家一看浇麦的信心更高了，在半月内把受霜打的麦都普遍浇了四遍到七遍。浇后又买回一百六十七斤硫酸?上了追肥。这样就战胜了霜灾。
    霜灾后，麦刚被挽救过来，有的才开始孕穗，麦棵上又发现有吸浆虫；吸浆虫刚被消灭不久，小麦才扬花四五天，大家还没喘过气来，又连续刮了四个晚上的大风；风灾过去，又下了大雾。但因为他们积极想办法，向这些灾害进行斗争，小麦只遭受了轻微的损失。今年焦润申组的小麦，虽说前后连续遭受了五次严重的灾害，但由于他们实行了深耕细作、合理密植、加工施肥，战胜灾害，仍然获得了丰收，全组二十八亩小麦共打麦八千五百多斤，平均每亩三百多斤，比去年增产了近八成（去年每亩平均收一百七十斤）。现在全组对争取秋粮增产都充满了信心。
