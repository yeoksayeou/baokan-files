Xinhua News Agency, London, July 15th: According to the "Daily Worker" in London, the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party held a meeting on the 11th to discuss the following issues: the British people's struggle to stop the "Cold War" and strive for Western countries to hold talks with the Soviet Union; the colonial wars of British imperialism, especially the war against the people of Kenya; and the British Communist Party's views on increasing agricultural production in Britain.

William Lauchlan, Secretary of the Scottish organization of the British Communist Party, said: "We see everywhere this obvious indication that the British people want to stop the 'Cold War' and hold peace talks. Needless to say, it is the responsibility of the workers' movement to immediately launch a movement across the country to force the government to invite the Soviet Union to participate in international negotiations. The workers' movement should facilitate the holding of talks with the Soviet Union in the near future." Lauchlan said that the British people must support the proposal for great power talks with practical actions and advocate for the cessation of all procrastination in Korea.

Pam Dutt, Vice-Chairman of the British Communist Party, said regarding the situation in the colonies that massacres and arrests were taking place in Kenya. Black people are being searched and arrested. If they flee to the mountains to escape this persecution, they are shelled and shot.

Jack Dunman, an expert on agricultural issues, pointed out that some people are trying to justify Britain's dependence on the United States by using the excuse that Britain must import a large amount of the food and raw materials it needs. Dunman said: "We do need raw materials and food. But we don't need to import the food that we can produce ourselves. Not only that, but we can produce much more food."

    英共执委会讨论英国人民保卫和平问题
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国“工人日报”报道，英国共产党执行委员会在十一日召开会议，讨论了下列问题：英国人民为停止“冷战”和争取西方国家与苏联举行会谈而斗争；关于英帝国主义的殖民战争，特别是对怯尼亚人民的战争问题；英国共产党对英国增加农业产品问题的意见。
    英国共产党苏格兰组织的书记威廉·洛克伦说：“我们到处看见这种明显的表示：英国人民希望停止‘冷战’和举行和平谈判。不用说，工人运动的责任是在全国立刻展开一个运动，迫使政府邀请苏联参加国际谈判。工人运动应当促成与苏联的会谈能在不久的将来举行。”洛克伦说，英国人民必须以实际行动支持大国会谈的建议和主张停止在朝鲜的一切拖延行动。
    英共副主席帕姆·杜德就殖民地的情况说，在怯尼亚正在进行着屠杀和逮捕。对黑种人进行着搜查并逮捕他们。如果他们为了躲避这种迫害而逃往山里，就遭到炮击和枪杀。
    农业问题专家杰克·丹曼指出，有人企图以英国必须输入大量它所需要的粮食和原料作为藉口，为英国依赖于美国作辩解。丹曼说：“我们的确需要原料和粮食。但是我们不需要输入我们自己能够生产的粮食。不但如此，我们还能够生产多得多的粮食。”
