Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: London dispatch: Resolutions passed by local organizations of the British Labour Party across the country, to be submitted to the Labour Party's annual conference in Margate on September 28th, were published here on the 21st.

Of these resolutions, more than half are related to foreign policy. These resolutions condemn the foreign policy of the United States and demand that the British government break away from American control and adopt an independent foreign policy. A resolution from an organization in the London area of the Labour Party condemns, saying, "We are rapidly becoming a dependency of the United States."

Many resolutions call for expanding trade between East and West, convening a five-power conference including People's China, and admitting People's China into the United Nations.

Some resolutions oppose arming West Germany. One resolution points out, "The policy of hastily pushing Germany onto the road of rearmament is strengthening the forces of reaction and threatening the democratic future of European politics and society." The resolution calls on the Labour Party to oppose the reconstruction of the German "Defense Force" and demands the realization of a unified, democratic Germany that does not participate in military alliances.

In addition, some resolutions also call for the withdrawal of American troops from Britain and the removal of American military bases in Britain.

On domestic issues, many resolutions call for the nationalization of agricultural land and some important large enterprises. One motion accuses many leaders of the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress of "compromising" with the government of big capitalists.

TASS, London, July 20th: According to a report in the British "Worker's Daily," the British-Soviet Friendship Society will organize voters to visit the House of Commons on July 21st. On this day, the House of Commons will begin debating foreign policy issues. Voters want to convince members of the House of Commons to believe that negotiations must be held between East and West, because this negotiation is the most important stage on the road to establishing world peace. In recent weeks, extensive preparations have been made for this measure throughout Britain. According to the "Worker's Daily," a large number of voters in the Nottingham constituency visited Tom O'Brien, chairman of the British Trades Union Congress and a member of Parliament, urging him to support trade between East and West. O'Brien assured members of the delegation that he would report the voters' suggestions to the Supreme Council of the British Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party Executive Committee. Another delegation visited Martin Redman, who also represents Nottingham in the House of Commons. Voters from Lancashire, the West of England, and cities along the south coast of England are preparing to go to London on July 21st. On July 21st, many delegations from various constituencies in London will visit the House of Commons. "The House of Commons should decisively declare that a four-power agreement is absolutely necessary. The first step should be peaceful negotiations between the heads of the four powers," the "Worker's Daily" concluded.
