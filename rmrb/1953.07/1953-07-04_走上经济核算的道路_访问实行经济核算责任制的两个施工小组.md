Embarking on the Road of Economic Accounting
——Visiting Two Construction Teams Implementing Economic Accounting Responsibility Systems
By Our Correspondent Chen Ji

    After the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology construction site compiled work plans, established an engineering dispatch system, established an administrative responsibility system, formulated a technical responsibility system, and stipulated a technical supply responsibility system, it gradually overcame the phenomenon of no one being responsible in construction. Based on the establishment of the responsibility system, the "Group Economic Accounting Handbook" was adopted at the second construction site. These measures, like a series of interlocking chains, mutually changed the chaotic situation of construction management, giving it a new look.

    The adoption of the Economic Accounting Handbook allows the workers of each construction team to know how much work is done each day, how much labor is used, how much material is used, and how much wages are earned. With this handbook, the workers have a clear idea in their minds and will implement the economic accounting responsibility system within the team in the spirit of being masters of their own affairs, in order to complete the state plan "better, faster, and more economically." This handbook is mainly composed of material requisition slips, piecework contracts, project inspection and acceptance forms, and liaison contracts.

    Material Requisition Slips and "Economy"

    At the second construction site, under the scorching sun, an old carpenter dismantled a formwork board that had been used three times, quickly tidied it up, and then patiently bent down to pick up the stray nails on the ground, putting them into his toolbox. After the carpenter left, there was not a single missing nail on the ground. But just over twenty days ago, when I walked through here, the nails scattered all over the ground almost tore my cloth shoes. At that time, a worker told me, "We have nails everywhere here! If we walk here carelessly, the nails will pierce our feet, and we won't be able to work." What is the reason for this change? I thought as I walked into the shed, where I saw the old carpenter talking to a sturdy worker in black.

    "This time, we saved a lot of wood!"

    "Yes! But if we use our brains more, we can save even more!" The worker in black stopped talking when he saw me.

    "Comrade, is there anything I can help you with?" the worker in black asked me.

    "I want to ask you: Why are there no lost nails here now?"

    The worker in black did not answer me immediately. He slowly took out a notebook from his cloth pocket, which read "Group Economic Accounting Handbook"; he then pulled out a card from the notebook and handed it to me. The front of the card read "Material Requisition Slip." Inside the card, the quantities of formwork boards, the quota of wood and nails required for a formwork board, the quantities and times of wood and nails requisitioned, the total amount of material saved and wasted, etc., were written. He was afraid that I would not understand, so he explained to me: "With this requisition slip, we know how much work to do and how much material we can use. This is called material consumption quota. With this quota, we cannot requisition more materials, nor can we use more materials. If we use too much, exceeding the quota, we cannot requisition any more! Comrade, the reason why there are no lost nails on the ground now is because of this. The fact that our formwork boards have been reused four times is also for this reason. However, using old materials does not save much material. We still need to find tricks to save materials." He was talking happily when someone outside suddenly called him to a meeting, and he hurriedly walked out of the shed. The old carpenter pointed at him and introduced me: "He is our carpentry team leader, named Tang Daru. My name is Xie Songlin, and I am a member of his team." I sat beside Xie Songlin, wanting to ask them how to find tricks to save materials. He stood up to send the formwork board sample to the worker installing the formwork board. I followed him to the place where the formwork board was being installed. I saw that the formwork board here was different from the one I had just seen. The formwork board here was not a single one, but four or five pieced together. Xie Songlin pointed to these formwork boards and said, "Look! This is the trick!" Then, he told me the story of how this trick came about.

    In late May, Tang Daru's team adopted the material requisition slip. One day, Tang Daru proposed at a team meeting: Now the construction site does not have enough wood. The leaders want us to find ways to change the method of installing formwork boards. What should we do? Everyone spoke up, and based on their years of experience, they came up with a "splicing method." Using this method, several formwork boards can be spliced together for installation. The spliced formwork boards can share wood, thus saving materials. After the team meeting, it was decided that technicians Xie Songlin and Niu Jiyu would experiment. As a result, it really saved materials, but it was too much trouble. At that time, some people wavered: "It's too much trouble, why bother doing this?" Tang Daru said, "Saving wood is beneficial to the country. It doesn't matter if we put in a little more effort." The wavering people had nothing to say. The method of combining formwork boards was realized. More than 200 cubic meters of formwork boards were made, saving more than 20 cubic meters of wood and more than 10,000 nails.

    After listening to this story, I also heard that the concrete team – Han Weisheng's team – also achieved great results after adopting the material requisition slip. I went to find Han Weisheng, who was tamping concrete. I saw that the work site of Han Weisheng's team was cleaned very cleanly, with no accumulation of cement. The worker pouring cement gently opened the cement paper bag, poured the cement into the wooden bucket, then shook the paper bag, shaking off the cement attached to the paper bag, and then put the intact paper bags together and sent them to the warehouse. But last year in Shenyang, this team threw the paper bags on the ground, the paper bags were broken and turned into waste paper. Cement was scattered all over the ground, and no one cared about it. When Han Weisheng saw me, he walked towards me and told me loudly: "We saved four bags of cement in three days. This is thanks to the material requisition slip. The material requisition slip combines our interests with the interests of the country. If we save materials, it will be recorded on the requisition slip, and we will receive a bonus based on it in the future. The country benefits, and we also benefit." He paused and said: "The material requisition slip also simplifies the material requisition procedures. In the past, requisitioning materials was as difficult as Wu Zixu crossing Zhaoguan! Requisitioning materials once required running to seven or eight places, stamping five or six seals, and taking four or five hours, and you may not even be able to requisition them. My team leader has also become a material clerk. We were afraid of requisitioning materials, so we simply requisitioned more at a time. Anyway, there was no quota for how much to requisition. If we had more materials, we didn't care about wasting some, so how could we talk about saving!"

    "Now with the material requisition slip, there is no need for so much bureaucratic procedure. I walk into the warehouse, hand the requisition slip to the material clerk, get a stamp, and requisition the materials in three minutes."

    With the material requisition slip, workers avoided the trouble of signing and stamping, and also mastered the material quota. Reducing material costs has a mass base. New material consumption quotas also emerged from the creative labor of workers. The practice of Tang Daru's team and Han Weisheng's team has proven this point.

    Piecework Contract and "Fast"

    The material requisition slip solved the problem of "saving," but it did not solve the problem of "fast." Therefore, in the group economic accounting handbook, there is also a piecework contract. This piecework contract is the concretization of the construction work plan. The piecework contract is jointly formulated by the worker representatives and the construction site负责人 based on the team's work plan. The piecework contract specifies the amount of work a team must complete in a period of time, the labor quota, the number of people needed, the time required, and the amount of wages, etc. In Tang Daru's words, "With a piecework contract, each of us knows how much work we have to do each day, how much labor we have to use, how much time we have to spend, and how much wages we can get." I almost visited every worker in Tang Daru's team, and they all knew two things: how much work they did and how much wages they received. This change has never happened before. In the past, workers did not know how much work they had to do each day, let alone how much wages they could earn in a day. At that time, when workers went to work, they looked for construction workers to allocate tasks. If the task could not be allocated, they had to sit idle. Once the task was assigned, they did not know when it would be completed. When it was time to pay wages, the construction worker roughly estimated how much work the team had done and issued a task notification to the worker team leader. The team leader took this unreliable task notification to collect wages. The workers had no idea in their minds, and the enthusiasm for work could not be brought into play. Before Tang Daru's team had a piecework contract, they often failed to complete the plan, averaging only 70 percent of the plan, and there were frequent reworks and defective products.

    Since adopting the piecework contract, Tang Daru's team has exceeded the plan every day and broken the quota every time. Workers' wages have also increased. In the past, a first-class worker could earn 20,000 yuan per day, but now they can earn 40,000 yuan; in the past, a third-class worker could earn more than 19,000 yuan per day, but now they can earn more than 26,000 yuan. The second time, Tang Daru's team formulated a piecework contract and completed the plan ahead of schedule. What used to be the work of two people can now be done by one person. A new labor quota has grown up in Tang Daru's team.

    The same is true for Han Weisheng's team. They completed six days' worth of tasks in five days, but Han Weisheng still said: "The efficiency is too slow, far from the requirements of the country!" He once discussed with the workers to improve the operation method and save two laborers. In the past, using bamboo baskets to carry stones exhausted three people, and they could not even supply the demand; now, using small iron carts to push stones requires only two people. Han Weisheng said: "This kind of improvement is not good enough. We must now study technology well and improve our operating level so that our efficiency can be improved more quickly. We all understand: the higher the efficiency, the faster the construction, the better the country will be, and the happier we will be."

    Mutual Inspection System and "Good"

    The material requisition slip solved the problem of "saving," the piecework contract solved the problem of "fast," and there is still the problem of "good" to be solved. The so-called "good" problem is the problem of project quality.

    Let's see how these two teams solved this "good" problem.

    The workers' understanding is gradually improving. When Tang Daru's team first started implementing the piecework contract, some workers only considered how to improve efficiency. They felt that doing things quickly could earn more wages, but doing things well could not earn more wages. In order to do things quickly, they did not care about the quality. Tang Daru discovered this problem and convened a living review meeting to criticize this idea. In order to ensure quality, they decided to implement a mutual inspection - a system of mutual quality inspection. It is stipulated that at the end of each day, the workers should inspect each other's quality to see if there are any problems and whether they meet the standards. The implementation of this system has indeed improved the quality to 90 percent. Once, I had the opportunity to participate in their work of implementing the mutual inspection system. Each worker carried a steel ruler and a hammer, carefully measuring the dimensions and hammering nails. After the inspection, everyone gathered together to expose the facts of poor quality and improve them in time. But Tang Daru said: "This is not good enough, because we are inspecting ourselves, and there are always shortcomings that we cannot see. We must also let others inspect, and implement a shift handover inspection system."

    The so-called shift handover inspection system means that after Tang Daru's carpentry team has made the formwork boards, before handing them over to the concrete team to pour cement, the concrete team must inspect these formwork boards. I once understood the implementation of the shift handover inspection system. One day, Han Weisheng's concrete team inspected the formwork boards of Tang Daru's team. Han Weisheng repeatedly looked at the formwork boards and measured the dimensions. At one point, he pointed out: "The nails here are not nailed firmly! The dimensions here are not right!..." As he spoke, he wrote some notes on the shift handover inspection form. After a while, two workers from Tang Daru's team came over, nailed the nails firmly, and corrected the dimensional errors. Han Weisheng's team also has a system of mutual quality inspection within the team, and they also often hold review meetings to correct phenomena of poor quality. Recently, the concrete beams they have made still have the problem of exposed tendons. They convened several meetings to specifically discuss this issue and propose solutions. Concrete worker Wang Xiangyi said: "If a beam does not meet the standards, it will affect the quality of the entire building. This year, we must eliminate pitting, honeycombing, and dog holes in concrete projects, and not produce a single defective product." I have seen the situation of Tang Daru's team and Han Weisheng's team ensuring project quality, and I firmly believe that Wang Xiangyi's hope will be realized this year.

    The New Road for Construction Workers in New China

    The workers of Tang Daru's team and Han Weisheng's team not only mastered the material quota and labor quota, but also created new material quotas and labor quotas; not only improved labor efficiency and saved national resources, but also initially ensured project quality. The group economic accounting handbook composed of material requisition slips, piecework contracts, mutual quality inspection systems, and shift handover inspection systems has turned the abstract concept of "better, faster, and more economical" into a living fact. This fact shows that construction workers have embarked on the road of economic accounting. In order to ensure the implementation of the group economic accounting responsibility system, Tang Daru's team and Han Weisheng's team also established the team's individual responsibility system, living review meeting system, and liaison contract system. The team's individual responsibility system stipulates the responsibilities of the team leader and all workers in the team and the relationship between them in their work, ensuring that the team plan can be realized on a daily and timely basis. The living review meeting system is to frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism within the team, uniting all the workers in the team like a family, and jointly fighting to implement the principle of "better, faster, and more economical." The liaison contract system stipulates the relationship between the various teams, ensuring that the teams work rhythmically like the gears of a clock. For example, Tang Daru's carpentry team and Han Weisheng's concrete team have established a liaison contract system, enabling the two teams to work in a coordinated manner. Through these systems, the team's life is improved, and the relationship between the teams is improved. With these systems, workers can manage themselves well and firmly establish the group economic accounting responsibility system.

    I visited these two teams and saw that the construction workers already understand how to link their personal interests with the interests of the country, and have begun to learn how to manage their work from the perspective of economic accounting, and to create outstanding achievements. This is the victory of the construction workers of New China.

    走上经济核算的道路
    ——访问实行经济核算责任制的两个施工小组
    本报记者　陈迹
    北京钢铁工业学院工区编制了作业计划，建立了工程调度制，确立了行政责任制，拟定了技术责任制，规定了技术供应责任制后，慢慢地克服了施工中无人负责的现象。又在建立责任制的基础上，在第二工地采用了小组经济核算手册。这些措施，就像一个套着一个的锁炼一样，互相为用地改变着施工管理的混乱情况，使之出现了新的面貌。
    经济核算手册的采用，就是让每个施工小组的工人知道每天做多少工作，用多少人工，多少材料，得多少工资。有了这个手册，工人们心中就有了数，就会以主人翁的姿态，在小组内实行经济核算责任制，以便“又好、又快、又省”地完成国家计划。这个手册，主要地是由领料手折、计件合同、工程检收单和联系合同等所组成的。
    领料手折与“省”
    在第二工地里，火炽的阳光下，一个年老的木工拆开使用过三次的模型板，将它迅速地整理好，又弯着背耐心地拣起地上的洋钉，装进工具箱。当这个木工走后，地上没有一根丢失的洋钉。而在二十多天前，走过这里时，横七竖八地躺在地上的洋钉，几乎把我的布鞋划破。那时候，工人对我说：“咱们这里遍地是洋钉呀！咱们走过这里，一不小心，洋钉刺破了脚，就不能干活了。”这种情况的改变是什么原因呢？我一边想，一边走，走进了工棚，我看见那个年老的木工正在跟一个穿黑衣服的壮实的工人谈话。
    “这一次，咱们省的木料可老鼻子啦！”
    “是呀！不过，再动动脑筋，还能多省呢！”穿黑衣服的工人瞧见我来，停止了谈话。
    “同志，有什么事吗？”穿黑衣服的工人问我。
    “我想问问你们：在这里为什么没有丢失的洋钉了？”
    穿黑衣服的工人没有随即答复我。他慢吞吞地从布口袋里掏出一个本子，本子上写着“小组经济核算手册”；他又从小本子里抽出一张卡片，交给我。卡片的正面写着“领料手折”。在卡片里面，写着模型板的数量、一个模型板需用木料和洋钉的定额、领出木料和洋钉的数量和时间、节省材料和浪费材料的总数等等。他怕我看不懂，特意地为我解释说：“有了这个手折，咱们知道干多少活，只能用多少材料。这叫做材料消耗定额。有了这个定额，咱们不能多领材料，也不能多用材料。多用了，超过定额，就不能再领呀！同志，现在地上没有丢失的洋钉，就是这个原因。咱们的模型板，重复使用了四次，也是这个原因。不过，利用旧料，还省不了多少材料。咱们还要找窍门，来节省材料。”他说得正高兴，忽然外面有人叫他去开会，他紧忙走出工棚。那位年老的木工指着他，给我介绍：“他是咱们的木工组长，名叫唐大儒。我叫谢松林，是他的组员。”我坐在谢松林的身旁，想问问他们怎样找窍门来节省材料。他站起来，要把模型板的样品送给安装模型板的工人。我跟他走到安装模型板的地方，我看见这里模型板和我刚才看到的不一样，这里模型板不是单个的，而是四个或五个拼在一起的。谢松林指着这些模型板说：“你瞧！这就是窍门呀！”接着，他告诉了我这个窍门产生的故事。
    五月下旬，唐大儒小组采用了领料手折。有一天，唐大儒在小组会上提出：现在工地的木料不够用，上级要我们想办法，改变安装模型板的办法，我们怎么办呀？你一言，我一语，大伙根据自己多年的经验，凑出了一个“拼装法”。用这个方法，可以把好几个模型板拼在一起，进行安装。拼在一起的模型板，可以合用木料，因而可以节省材料。开了小组会，决定由技工谢松林、牛吉玉来试验。结果果真省料，但太费劲。当时有人动摇：“太费劲了，何必这样干呢？”唐大儒说：“省木料，对国家有利。咱们费点劲，算不了什么。”动摇的人，没有话讲。合拼模型板的方法实现了。做了二百多立方公尺的模型板，省了二十多立方公尺的木料，一万多根洋钉。
    我听了这段故事，又听说混凝土小组——韩维生小组采用领料手折之后，也获得很大效果。我去找韩维生，韩维生正在捣固混凝土。我看见韩维生小组的工作地点，打扫得干干净净，没有积存一点水泥。倒水泥的工人，轻轻地揭开水泥纸袋，把水泥倒在木桶里，又抖了抖纸袋，把附着在纸袋上的水泥都抖了下来，然后又把完整无缺的纸袋放在一起，送进仓库。而这个小组去年在沈阳时，把纸袋乱丢在地上，纸袋破裂了，变成废纸。水泥散失了满地，还没人过问。韩维生看见我，向我走来，大声地告诉我：“咱们三天内，省了四袋水泥。这是领料手折的功劳。领料手折，把咱们的利益和国家的利益结合在一块啦。咱们省了料，就记在手折上，将来根据它来领超额奖金。国家有了利，咱们也有了利。”他停了一停说：“领料手折，还简化了领料手续。过去咱们领料，就好像伍子胥过昭关那样的难呀！领一回料，跑七八个地方，盖五六个章，费了四五个钟头，还不一定领得着。我这组长也成了材料员啦。咱们怕领料，所以领一次，就索性多领一些。反正领多领少，又没个定额。咱们材料多了，浪费一些，也不在乎，还谈什么节约呢！”
    “现在有了领料手折，就不用那么多的官僚手续了。我走进仓库，把手折交给材料员，盖个章，三分钟就领到料。”
    工人们有了领料手折，避免了签名盖章的麻烦，又掌握了材料定额。节省材料成本，就有了群众的基础。新的材料消耗定额，也从工人的创造性的劳动中产生出来。唐大儒小组和韩维生小组的实践结果，已经证明了这个道理。
    计件合同与“快”
    领料手折解决了“省”的问题，还没有解决“快”的问题。因此在小组经济核算手册里，还有一个计件合同。这个计件合同，就是施工作业计划的具体化。计件合同，就是根据班组作业计划，由工人代表和工地负责人共同拟定的。在计件合同内，规定一个小组在一段时期内要完成的工程数量、劳动定额、需要人数、需用时间和工资数目等等。用唐大儒的话来讲：“有了计件合同，咱们每个人每天知道要干多少活，要用多少人工，要花多少时间，要得多少工资。”我几乎访问了唐大儒小组的每个工人，他们都晓得两件事：做了多少工作，拿了多少工资。这种变化，是从来没有过的。在过去，工人们不知道每天要做多少工作，更不知道一天能得多少工资。那时候，工人们上了班，找施工员分配任务。分配不了任务，只好窝工。分配了任务，究竟什么时候完成，也不知道。等到要发工资了，施工员大概估计一下：这个小组干了多少活，开个任务通知单给工人小组长。小组长拿着这个不可靠的任务通知单，去领工资。工人们心中无数，干工作的积极性不能发挥。唐大儒小组在没有计件合同的时候，常常完不成计划，平均每天只能完成计划的百分之七十，还经常返工，出废品。
    自从采用了计件合同以后，唐大儒小组天天超过计划，时时突破定额。工人们工资也增多了。过去一个一等工每天得两万元，现在却可得到四万元；过去一个三等工每天得一万九千多元，现在可得两万六千多元。第二次，唐大儒小组拟定了计件合同，又提前完成计划。过去两个人的活，现在一个人能完成。新的劳动定额，在唐大儒小组内成长起来。
    韩维生小组也是一样。他们在五天内完成了六天的任务，但韩维生还说：“效率太慢了，离国家的要求还远得很哩！”他曾经和工人商量，改善操作方法，节省了两个劳动力。过去用箩筐挑石子，三个人累得满头大汗，还供应不上需要；现在改用小铁车推石子，两个人就行了。韩维生说：“这种改进，还不够好。我们现在还要好好学技术，提高操作水平，我们的效率才能更快地提高。我们大伙都了解：效率越高，建设越快，国家就更好了，咱们也就更幸福了。”
    互检制与“好”
    领料手折解决了“省”的问题，计件合同解决了“快”的问题，还有一个“好”的问题没有解决。所谓“好”的问题，就是工程质量的问题。
    让我们看看这两个小组是怎样解决这个“好”的问题的。
    工人们的认识是逐渐提高的。唐大儒小组在开始执行计件合同时，有的工人只考虑怎么提高效率。他们觉得：干得快，可以多得工资；干得好，又不能多得工资。为了干得快，不管质量好不好。唐大儒发见这个毛病，召开了一个生活检讨会，批判了这种思想。他们为了保证质量，决定实行互检——互相检查质量的制度。规定在每天下班的时候，工友们互相检查质量，看看有没有毛病，合不合规格。实行了这个制度，果然提高质量到百分之九十。有一次，我有机会参加了他们实行互检制的工作。每个工人带着一把钢尺，一个鎯头，仔细地量尺寸，敲钉子。检查之后，大家聚拢在一起，互相揭发质量不好的事实，及时改进。但是唐大儒说：“这还不行，因为咱们自己检查自己，总有看不到的缺点，咱们还要让别人检查，实行交接班检查制度。”
    所谓交接班检查制度，就是在唐大儒木工小组做好了模型板，交给混凝土小组打水泥之前，混凝土小组要检查这些模型板。我曾经了解了交接班检查制度执行的情况。有一天，韩维生混凝土小组检查唐大儒小组的模型板。韩维生反复地看了看模型板，又量了量尺寸。在一处指出：“这儿的钉子，钉得不牢靠呀！这儿的尺寸也不对头呀！……”说着，他就在交接班检查单上，记了些记号。过了一会，唐大儒小组的两个工人走来，钉牢了钉子，改正了尺寸的错误。韩维生小组内部也有互相检查质量的制度，也常常开检讨会，纠正质量不好的现象。最近，他们做出来的混凝土大梁，还有露筋的毛病。他们召开了几次会议，专门讨论这个问题，提出解决的办法。混凝土工人王相义说：“一个大梁不合标准，就会影响整个大楼的质量。今年，咱们要在混凝土工程上，消灭麻面、蜂窝、狗洞，不出一个废品。”我看了唐大儒小组和韩维生小组保证工程质量的状况，深信王相义的希望在今年一定会实现。
    新中国建筑工人的新的道路
    唐大儒小组和韩维生小组的工人们，不但掌握了材料定额和劳动定额，而且创造着新的材料定额和劳动定额；不但提高了劳动效率和节省了国家资材，而且初步地保证了工程质量。领料手折、计件合同、互相检查质量制度和交接班检查制度所组成的小组经济核算手册，已经把“又好、又快、又省”的抽象的概念，变成了活生生的事实。这个事实，表明建筑工人已经走上了经济核算的道路。为了保证小组经济核算责任制的实行，唐大儒小组和韩维生小组还建立了小组的个人负责制、生活检讨会议制和联系合同制。小组的个人负责制，规定了小组长和全组所有工人的责任和彼此之间在工作上的关系，保证小组计划能够按日按时地实现。生活检讨会议制，就是在小组内部经常地开展批评与自我批评，把全组工人团结得像一家人，共同地为贯彻“又好、又快、又省”的原则而斗争。联系合同制，规定了各有关小组互相之间的关系，保证各小组像钟表的齿轮一样地有节奏地工作。比如唐大儒木工小组和韩维生混凝土小组，就建立了联系合同制，使得两个小组能够协调地工作。通过这些制度，就健全了小组的生活，搞好小组和小组之间的关系。有了这些制度，工人们能够很好地管理自己，把小组经济核算责任制坚固地建立起来。
    我访问了这两个小组，看到建筑工人们已经懂得把个人的利益和国家的利益联系起来，已经开始学会用经济核算的观点来管理自己的工作，来创造优异的成绩。这是新中国建筑工人们的胜利。
