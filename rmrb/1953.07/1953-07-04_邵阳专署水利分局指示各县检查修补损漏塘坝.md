    Shaoyang Administrative Office Water Conservancy Bureau Instructs Counties to Inspect and Repair Damaged and Leaky Reservoirs

    Letter from the Shaoyang Administrative Office Water Conservancy Bureau, Hunan Province: Reader Long Nanlin suggested in the newspaper on May 22nd that "The Shaoyang Administrative Office should immediately take effective measures to inspect and repair the damaged and leaky reservoirs in the area." We are now informing you of our handling of this issue:

    In our district's water conservancy construction movement last winter and this spring, there was insufficient mastery of technology. In addition, some cadres did not understand engineering technology and only sought to do more and faster, neglecting project quality, resulting in some projects not meeting standards, with phenomena such as the collapse of the outer slopes of earth dams and water leakage from culverts. The CPC Shaoyang Prefectural Committee and the Administrative Office had noticed this problem. After the establishment of the Shaoyang Prefectural Drought Prevention and Anti-Drought Production Joint Command in early May, it immediately instructed all localities to combine spring plowing production to do a good job in project maintenance and strengthen water storage management. At the end of April and mid-May, cadres were organized to go to the countryside to inspect water conservancy work on two occasions. In addition, it is also planned that after rice transplanting, all counties will conduct a general inspection and repair of water conservancy projects. After seeing the reader's opinion, we also instructed the Drought Prevention Commands of Dongkou and Xinning counties to immediately understand the actual situation; if there are collapsed earthworks or cracks, they should mobilize the masses to repair, fill the soil, compact it, and increase the slope. For those earth dams that are leaking, people should be found to go into the water to plug the leaks or drain the water for repairs, depending on the situation, to maintain water storage.

### 邵阳专署水利分局指示各县检查修补损漏塘坝

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    邵阳专署水利分局指示各县检查修补损漏塘坝
    湖南省邵阳专署水利分局来信：五月二十二日读者龙楠林在报上建议“邵阳专署应即采取有效办法检查并修补当地损漏的塘坝”。兹将我们对此问题的处理情况告诉你们：
    我区去冬今春兴修水利运动中对技术掌握不够，加之部分干部对工程技术不懂，只图求多求快，忽视工程质量，致使部分工程不合标准，而有土坝外坡坐崩及涵洞漏水的现象。中共邵阳地委及专署曾注意了这个问题。五月初专署防旱抗旱生产联合指挥部成立后，即指示各地结合春耕生产做好工程养护及加强蓄水管理工作，四月底、五月中旬并先后两次组织干部下乡检查水利工作。此外还准备在插秧后由各县普遍进行检查与补修水利工作。看到读者意见后，我们又指示洞口、新宁两县防旱指挥部立即了解实际情况；如有崩垮土方或开裂的，即动员群众补修、填土、夯实、加大边坡。土坝漏水者，应分别情况找人下水堵塞或放干修补，以保持储水。
