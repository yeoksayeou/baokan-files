(Xinhua News Agency, 22nd) The Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry issued "Instructions on Implementing Responsibility Systems and Improving Project Quality in Capital Construction" on July 10th. The instructions first pointed out: Since April this year, various capital construction units have successively launched mass movements against waste and to establish responsibility systems. In the past few months, those units that have earnestly grasped this central task in light of their specific circumstances have generally strengthened the sense of responsibility for state property among administrative cadres, technical personnel, and workers, and have begun to establish economic accounting thinking; the management level of enterprises has been significantly improved, and current work has been improved and promoted. However, the development of the central task of anti-waste and the establishment of a responsibility system is very uneven. Even to this day, some individual units are still starting this movement, while most units are just entering the stage of discussing how to specifically establish a responsibility system. This situation shows that it is very difficult to truly establish a responsibility system in all aspects. It requires a lot of ideological education, political work, and organizational work to consolidate the responsibility system. Facts have proved that units that have not grasped the central task of anti-waste and the establishment of a responsibility system have experienced delays in project progress, failure to start construction on time, poor project quality, and financial chaos. Therefore, in the third quarter, it is still necessary to continue to thoroughly inspect and implement the responsibility system (especially the technical responsibility system and the construction management responsibility system) in order to achieve the requirements of improving project quality and completing the basic construction plan on schedule and in an all-round way. The quality inspection movement originally planned by the Ministry of Heavy Industry to be carried out after "anti-waste and the establishment of a responsibility system" will be merged into the work of continuing to implement the responsibility system.

The instructions require all capital construction units to seriously do the following work in the work of implementing the responsibility system and improving project quality:

First, all capital construction departments, whether Party A or Party B, should formulate specific plans, steps, and methods for thoroughly implementing the responsibility system based on the situation of their own establishment of the responsibility system movement. At present, the responsibility system of Party A should especially emphasize the responsibility system related to the completion of the plan, such as technical data, equipment supply, material supply, and financial investment management, so as to ensure that construction can be carried out according to the plan through these responsibility systems; in various construction units, the responsibility system for construction management should be seriously established. Various construction units should grasp the progress of on-site projects by establishing operation plans. In order to supervise the implementation of the operation plan, there also needs to be a sound dispatching agency and dispatching system.

Second, strengthen the technical responsibility system, improve technical management, and improve project quality. In view of the fact that varying degrees of poor quality problems have occurred in many projects at present, all construction sites must conscientiously launch a mass quality inspection movement on the basis of implementing the technical responsibility system under leadership to improve technical management. Through this inspection, the relevant responsibility system for technical management should be established. The instructions pointed out that in order to do this work well, all capital construction units must also pay attention to the following six points: (1) It should be stipulated that all projects must be strictly constructed according to the technical design and construction drawings. In order for construction personnel to correctly grasp the technical standards required in the design, it is necessary to carefully study the drawings and construction acceptance specifications before construction. In the future, before the construction of any project, the quality standards specifically stipulated in the design should be educated to all employees so that all employees can follow them. (2) It is necessary to earnestly formulate and implement construction operating procedures. During this quality inspection process, all construction sites should, according to the requirements of project quality, have designated personnel responsible for organizing the vast number of employees to discuss and absorb advanced mass experience to revise and add construction operating procedures. (3) Continue to implement the technical responsibility system. Various construction units have begun to establish this aspect of the responsibility system in the movement to establish the responsibility system. In the future, each construction site and work section will be required to have a technical person in charge. Only in this way can the phenomenon of no one being responsible for quality be eliminated. (4) Improve the technical inspection responsibility system. Departments related to the project (Party A, Party B, design department) should all bear the responsibility of technical supervision. The construction department should establish an independent technical inspection agency to conduct project quality inspection, testing, and inspection and acceptance of raw materials and semi-finished products; the design department should send on-site technical supervisors to check whether the construction department is carrying out construction according to the design; the user department (Party A), in addition to sending personnel to supervise the project quality of Party B, should also seriously do a good job in project acceptance. (5) Establish a mass quality responsibility system. Many units have created very good experiences (such as mass self-inspection system, daily closing inspection, upper and lower process inspection, handover inspection, hanging card system, etc.), which should be widely promoted. As long as the quality responsibility system is thoroughly implemented among all employees, so that they have a high sense of responsibility for the quality of each project, the project quality will be guaranteed. (6) After the quality inspection and after exposing the shortcomings in the quality, each construction site should formulate a technical measures plan to improve quality and organize special personnel to be responsible for its implementation. In the future, for all important projects, before construction, it is necessary to study in detail how to ensure the quality of construction (such as what construction methods to adopt, what technical responsibility system to establish), and formulate specific technical organizational measures plans.

The instructions finally pointed out that in order to ensure project quality and complete the basic construction plan on schedule, all capital construction units must also pay attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experience. The practice in recent years has repeatedly proved that if we can earnestly summarize advanced experience and organize its promotion, it will accelerate the speed of construction and improve project quality. Therefore, in the future, all construction units should organize and promote advanced experience in the central work of thoroughly implementing the responsibility system and carrying out quality inspections to ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan.

    重工业部指示所属各基本建设单位
    贯彻责任制提高工程质量
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府重工业部在七月十日发出了“关于在基本建设中贯彻责任制与提高工程质量的指示”。指示首先指出：今年四月以来，各个基本建设单位，相继展开了群众性的反浪费与建立责任制运动。几个月来，凡是结合本身具体情况，认真抓紧这一中心工作的单位，行政干部、技术人员及职工群众普遍加强了对国家财产的责任观念，开始树立了经济核算思想；企业的管理水平已有显著提高，并改善与推动了当前工作。但是，反浪费与建立责任制这一中心工作的发展是很不平衡的，甚至直到目前尚有个别单位还在开始发动这一运动，多数单位则刚在进入讨论如何具体地建立责任制度。这种情况说明了真正在各方面把责任制建立起来是极不容易的，它需要经过许多思想教育、政治工作与组织工作，才能把责任制巩固地建立起来。事实证明，凡是没有抓住反浪费与建立责任制这一中心工作的单位，都发生了工程进度迟缓、不能按时开工、工程质量低劣以及财务混乱等现象，因此在第三季度内，还必须继续深入地检查与贯彻责任制（特别是技术责任制与施工管理责任制），以达到提高工程质量与按期、全面地完成基本建设计划的要求。重工业部原计划在“反浪费与建立责任制”之后进行的质量检查运动，则合并在继续贯彻责任制这一工作中进行。
    指示要求各基本建设单位在贯彻责任制与提高工程质量工作中，必须认真做好下列工作：
    第一、所有基本建设部门，不论甲方或乙方，都应当根据本身建立责任制运动的情况，拟定深入贯彻责任制的具体计划、步骤与方法。在目前，甲方的责任制中，应特别强调与完成计划有关的技术资料、设备供应、材料供应以及财务投资管理等责任制度，以便经过这些责任制度保证能按计划施工；在各个施工单位，则应认真建立施工管理的责任制。各个施工单位要通过建立作业计划，掌握现场的工程进度。为了监督作业计划的执行，还需要有
    一个健全的调度机构与调度制度。
    第二、加强技术责任制，改善技术管理，提高工程质量。鉴于目前在不少工程中曾发生过程度不同的质量低劣的问题，因此各个施工现场必须有领导地在贯彻技术责任制的基础上，认真发动群众进行质量检查运动，改善技术管理。通过这一检查，应将有关技术管理方面的责任制度建立起来。指示指出为了做好这一工作，各基本建设单位还必须注意以下六点：（一）应规定所有的工程，必须严格根据技术设计及施工图进行施工。为了使施工人员能正确地掌握设计上所要求的技术标准，在施工之前，需要认真学习图纸、学习施工验收规范。今后任何一项工程在施工之前，都应将设计上所具体规定出的质量标准，向全体职工进行教育，以便全体职工有所遵循。（二）要认真制订与贯彻施工操作规程。在此次质量检查过程中，所有施工现场，应根据工程质量的要求，有专人负责组织广大职工一起讨论，吸收群众先进经验，将施工操作规程加以修正与增订。（三）继续贯彻技术责任制。各个施工单位在建立责任制的运动中，已开始建立这方面的责任制。今后要求每一个工地、工段，都有技术上的负责人。只有如此，才能消灭质量上的无人负责现象。（四）健全技术检查责任制。对工程有关的部门（甲方、乙方、设计部门）都应负技术监督的责任。施工部门应建立独立的技术检查机构，进行工程质量检查、检验，和原材料、半成品的检查与验收；设计部门应派出工地技术监督人，检查施工部门是否按设计进行施工；使用部门（甲方），除平时派人监督乙方之工程质量外，还应认真作好工程验收工作。（五）建立群众性的质量责任制。不少单位已创造出很好的经验（如群众性的自我检查制度、每日收工检查、上下工序检查、交接班检查、挂牌制等），应该普遍推广。只要把质量责任制深入贯彻到全体职工中，使他们对每一件工程质量都有了高度责任心，工程质量就有了保证。（六）经过质量检查，经过揭发质量中所存在的缺点，各个施工现场，应该制订改进质量的技术措施计划，并组织专人负责执行。今后凡是重要工程，在施工之先必须周详研究如何保证施工质量（如采用何种施工方法，建立什么技术责任制），并制订出具体的技术组织措施计划。
    指示最后指出：为了保证工程质量和按期完成基本建设计划，各基本建设单位还必须注意总结与推广先进经验。几年来的实践一再证明，如果我们能够认真总结先进经验，并加以组织推广，就会加快建设速度与提高工程质量。因此，今后各个施工单位，应在深入贯彻责任制、进行质量检查这一中心工作中，组织推广先进经验，以保证全面地完成国家计划。
