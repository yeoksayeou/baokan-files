Xinhua News Agency, July 21st:

    Various types of secondary schools across the country will begin enrollment in late July. To ensure successful enrollment and to guarantee the realization of the state's talent cultivation plan, this year's efforts will be based on the experience of the unified enrollment work in 1952. The work will still be planned uniformly by major administrative regions and organized uniformly by provinces and cities. In principle, junior secondary schools will be organized uniformly by provinces and cities. Each province and city will establish an enrollment committee, jointly composed of the responsible persons from the education, personnel, industry, agriculture and forestry, finance and economics, health, and cultural departments of the provincial and municipal people's governments, as well as the organization and propaganda departments of the provincial and municipal committees of the Chinese Communist Party, the cadre department of the political department of the provincial military region, and the provincial and municipal committees of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.  Responsible persons from central or greater administrative region-level business departments or schools that operate secondary specialized schools within each province or city will also participate. The enrollment committee will be responsible for leading all enrollment work for secondary schools within that province or city. Under the leadership of the enrollment committee, secondary schools nationwide will appropriately divide enrollment areas and conduct enrollment work simultaneously. Examination dates for schools affiliated with provinces and cities should strive for uniformity. Enrollment examinations in large cities will be held simultaneously with neighboring areas as much as possible to avoid student movement.
    Because the state is implementing planned construction, the enrollment of various types of secondary schools nationwide is subject to certain quotas. In order to meet the needs of higher education institutions, especially higher industrial schools, senior high schools nationwide are preparing to expand the enrollment of new students this year, and secondary technical schools will also see considerable development. To ensure that various types of senior secondary schools enroll sufficient qualified students according to plan, the enrollment committees of each province and city will strengthen publicity and education efforts among junior high school graduates. The idea of reluctance to apply for normal schools must be criticized. This year, both junior high school graduates and primary school graduates are more numerous than last year. Therefore, each region will select better students to enter secondary schools based on the students' educational level and health conditions. The children of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary servicemen, industrial workers, young peasants, workers and peasants, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese will be given priority in admission when their examination results are equal to those of other students.

    全国各类中等学校七月下旬开始招生
    【新华社二十一日讯】全国各类中等学校将在七月下旬开始招生。为了做好招生工作，保证实现国家培养人材的计划，今年将根据一九五二年统一招生工作的经验，仍由各大行政区统一计划，以省、市为单位统一布置进行；初级中等学校原则上由省、市统一布置进行。各省、市将成立招生委员会，由省、市人民政府的教育、人事、工业、农林、财经、卫生、文化各部门以及中共省、市委员会组织部和宣传部，省军区政治部干部部，中国新民主主义青年团省、市委员会的负责人共同组成，同时吸收在各该省、市内办有中等专科学校的中央或大区一级的业务部门或学校的负责人参加；由招生委员会负责领导各该省、市内中等学校的全部招生工作。全国中等学校在招生委员会领导下，将适当划分招生地区，同时进行招生工作。省、市所属学校考试日期力求划一。大城市的招生考试将尽量和邻近地区同时举行，以免学生流动。
    由于国家实行有计划的建设，全国各类中等学校的招生规定了一定的名额。为了适应高等学校特别是高等工业学校的需要，今年全国高级中学准备扩大招收新生，中等技术学校也有相当发展。为了保证各类高级中等学校按照计划招收足够的合格的学生，各省市招生委员会将加强对初中毕业生的宣传教育工作。对不愿投考师范学校的思想，必须加以批判。今年初中毕业生和小学毕业生都比去年多。因此，各地区将根据学生的文化程度和健康条件等来考选较好的学生进入中等学校，对革命烈士、革命军人家属的子女以及产业工人、青年农民、工农子女、少数民族及华侨子弟等，在考试成绩与其他学生同等时，将被优先录取。
