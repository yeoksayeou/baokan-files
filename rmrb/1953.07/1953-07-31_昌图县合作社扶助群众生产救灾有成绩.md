Changtu County Cooperatives in Liaoxi Province have achieved great success in assisting the masses in production and disaster relief. From October of last year to mid-June of this year, farmers sold a total of 14.0097 billion yuan worth of various agricultural and sideline products through the cooperatives. In addition to purchasing daily necessities, they also exchanged them for 300 horses, 400 cattle and donkeys, and 200 carts, which played a considerable role in overcoming the difficulties of the disaster and assisting production. According to incomplete statistics, more than 82,000 people in the county participated in sideline production. At present, under the principle of not affecting agricultural production, they are implementing a combination of agricultural and sideline production, and continuing various sideline productions. The reasons for the county's great success in leading the masses to do a good job in production and overcome the disaster are:

	I. Leadership attaches importance, division of labor and responsibility. The Changtu County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to production and disaster relief. In order to strengthen leadership, it has established production and disaster relief committees at all levels, with clear and specific division of labor: the Party and government are responsible for organizing and mobilizing; the cooperatives guarantee to find good sales channels for products, solve raw material problems, and provide technical guidance; the bank controls sideline loans. Because the division of labor is clear, and the close cooperation avoids the shortcomings of mutual dependence and inconsistent steps, this is the main key to doing a good job in production and disaster relief.

	II. Determining production by sales, using local materials. First, a full investigation and research was done on the local sideline conditions. According to the varieties, quality, price, and time that can be produced locally, sales channels were sought in various places. The county cooperative often has three salesmen outside, selling to major consumers such as grain companies, factories, mines, and enterprises. Efforts are made to fix production and sales plans, specifications, and quality through contracts to ensure realization. The county is backed by mountains in the east, and the Liao River in the west and north, with plains in the middle. According to the different sideline conditions in each district, practical and feasible production slogans are put forward, such as: quarrying, hunting—turning "barren mountains into treasure mountains"; dredging sand, fishing—turning "ditches into gold ditches"; using rice straw and sorghum stalks in the plains to weave straw bags and mats. The masses, based on the spirit of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, "relying on the mountains to eat mountains" and "relying on the river to eat the river," actively came up with 25 kinds of sideline industries such as sand dredging, quarrying, mat weaving, and pig raising. Because production and sales surveys were done in advance, and production and sales were combined, there was no backlog of products.

	III. Guiding technology and solving raw material problems. In some sideline industries, farmers, in the initial production, lacked technology, resulting in a lot of labor, little product, and very little income, which affected the mood of production. For example, the Chen Guojun mutual aid group in Wanbao Village, initially spinning hemp sack thread, because they could not repair the machine, only produced about two pounds of finished products per day. When the cooperative discovered this situation, it specially invited skilled technicians to patiently teach the technology, and as a result, the output increased to about four pounds per day. In order to improve production technology and exchange experiences, the cooperative specially organized "observation" seminars, and also formulated methods such as apprenticeships and on-site learning to improve product quality. The issue of raw materials is mainly solved by organizing mutual adjustment between districts, villages, and cooperatives, which can not only reduce costs, but also exchange what one has for what one needs. The county cooperative solves what the village cooperative is unable to solve. There are many types of sideline production, but in different seasons, there are production priorities for each period. The county cooperative firmly grasps this characteristic and tries its best to supply agricultural tools and raw materials in a planned and timely manner, so that sideline production can proceed smoothly.

Because the cooperative has helped its members and the masses to solve great difficulties in production and disaster relief, the cooperative itself has developed, and the relationship between the cooperative and the masses has become closer. (Hong Yin)

    昌图县合作社扶助群众生产救灾有成绩
    辽西省昌图县合作社扶助群众生产救灾有很大成绩。从去年十月到今年六月中旬，农民经过合作社推销各种农副业产品总值达一百四十亿零九千七百万元，除添买生活资料外，并换回马三百匹，牛、驴共四百头，车二百台，这对克服灾荒困难和扶助生产都起了相当作用。据不完全统计，全县参加副业生产的有八万二千多人，现仍在不影响农业生产的原则下，实行农副业生产相结合，继续各种副业生产。该县领导群众搞好生产、战胜灾荒取得很大成绩的原因有：
    一、领导重视，分工负责。中共昌图县委对生产救灾很重视，为了加强领导，特组成各级生产救灾委员会，并有明确的具体分工：党、政负责组织发动；合作社保证找好产品销路，解决原料问题，做好技术指导；银行掌握好副业贷款。由于分工明确，密切配合，避免了互相依赖和步调不统一等缺点，这是搞好生产救灾的主要关键。
    二、以销定产，就地取材。首先对本地的副业条件做了充分的调查研究，根据当地能生产的品种、质量、价格、时间，到各地找寻销路。县社经常有三名推销员在外，向粮食公司、厂矿、企业等主要消费者推销。尽量通过合同把产销计划和规格、质量等固定起来，保证实现。该县东靠大山，西、北靠辽河，中间是平原地带，根据各区不同的副业条件，提出切实可行的生产口号，如提出：打石、打猎——将“秃山变成宝山”；拉砂、打鱼——把“河沟变成金沟”；平原地带利用稻草、秫秸，编草袋、编席等。群众本着因地制宜，就地取材，“靠山吃山”“靠河吃河”的精神，积极想出拉砂、打石、编席、养猪等二十五种副业。由于事前做好了产销调查，实行产销结合，所以产品没有积压。
    三、指导技术，解决原料问题。有的副业，农民在初生产时，因为没有技术，形成了费工不少，产品不多，收入很小的现象，影响了生产情绪。像万宝村陈国君互助组，开始纺麻袋线，因不会修理机器，每日只出成品二斤上下。合作社发现这种情况，就特意把技术熟练的人请来，耐心地教技术，结果产量提高到每日四斤左右。为了提高生产技术，交流经验，合作社特组织“观摩”座谈会，又订出师傅教徒弟、实地学习等办法，提高产品质量。对原料问题，以组织区村社互相调剂为主，不但能降低成本，又能互通有无。村社无力解决的，统由县社解决。副业生产种类很多，但在不同季节，均有每一时期的生产重点，县社紧紧抓住这个特点，尽力做到有计划地及时供应农具、原料，使副业生产顺利进行。
    由于合作社帮助社员群众在生产救灾中解决了很大困难，合作社本身就得到了发展，合作社和群众的关系也就更加密切了。　（洪印）
