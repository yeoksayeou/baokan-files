Farmers in various parts of Southwest China have achieved results in drought resistance and seedling protection.
　　Since the beginning of summer, there has been a general lack of rain in the Southwest region, and drought conditions have appeared in various places. More than half of the counties in Sichuan Province, parts of counties in seven of the twelve special districts in Yunnan Province, fourteen counties in Guizhou Province, and parts of Xikang Province are suffering from drought. In these areas, an average of 20 to 40 percent of the rice paddies are short of water, with more severe cases reaching 60 percent, and the most severe cases reaching 80 to 90 percent. In many areas, dry fields cannot be planted with rice seedlings, and many of the planted fields have already dried and cracked. Some sweet potatoes, corn, and other crops have been withered or dried to death by the sun. For example, in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, 60 percent of the paddy fields have dried up, and in Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, more than 70,000 mu of farmland has cracked, and more than 230,000 mu of farmland have no water for planting. This year's drought has seriously affected the harvest of autumn crops.
　　After the drought occurred, Party and government leading organs in various places successively took emergency measures and vigorously led the masses in drought resistance and seedling protection. After the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an "Emergency Instruction on 'Drought Resistance and Seedling Protection'" to Party committees at all levels on June 19, leading organs in various places further clarified that "drought resistance and seedling protection" is the overriding central task in rural areas at present. The Sichuan and Guizhou Provincial Committees of the Communist Party of China and the Chongqing Municipal Committee issued instructions, making specific arrangements for drought resistance and seedling protection work. Now, in areas where the drought is severe, the leadership has mostly changed its original work plans and rearranged its work. The grassroots election work and the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline have been stopped and postponed. Counties that are conducting district and township enlarged cadre meetings and grassroots election cadre training have mostly ended ahead of schedule and transferred cadres to go deep into disaster areas to lead drought resistance work. The Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently organized two work teams to go to Jiangjin and Daxian special districts to assist in drought resistance work. The San Tai County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province has transferred more than 170 cadres from county-level organs, formed nine drought resistance work teams, and personally led them to work in the countryside under the leadership of responsible cadres such as the county party secretary and county magistrate. In addition to organizing work groups to help lead drought resistance work in various counties, Li Linzhi, secretary of the Suining Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province, personally went to the disaster area to inspect and supervise the work. Many counties have established "Drought Resistance and Seedling Protection" command headquarters, which are personally commanded by the county party secretary and county magistrate to strengthen the leadership of drought resistance work. In drought resistance and seedling protection, various places first criticized the wrong ideas of cadres and the masses, combined patriotic education, mobilized the masses to take active action, adopted methods such as finding water sources locally, and paid attention to solving problems such as work evaluation, scoring, and rational use of water in drought resistance, and carried out drought resistance movements. The Qionglai County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province has made specific solutions to the problems of food rations and tools for the masses in drought resistance. Farmers in Luming and Saba Townships in Xiangyun County, Yunnan Province, dug wells in dry rivers and field corners, used water sources to irrigate fields, and planted rice seedlings on more than 580 mu of land. In the third district of Yuxi County, cadres changed their wrong understanding of drought resistance, fully mobilized the masses by calculating carefully and cultivating activists to take the lead. In half a month, they newly dug and repaired 387 ponds and dragon pools, supported 127 levers, and 148 waterwheels, saving more than 12,500 mu of rice seedlings. Xinli Township in Suining County, Sichuan Province, solved the problem of rational use of water and the use of labor for setting up dams, and set up 35 dams in ten days. In some areas, government cadres, factories, and schools also helped farmers fight drought. Comrade Jiao Zhaozhi, Secretary of the Bishan County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province, led nearly 10,000 people from the Party, government, army, organs, and schools to help farmers pump water and carry water to irrigate fields. The Southwest Cooperative Business Bureau and the Chongqing Qianjin Fire Extinguishing Machine Factory have lent water pumps to farmers to pump water to save seedlings. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, farmers in various places have actively taken action to carry out drought resistance and seedling protection. In the past week, various places in the region have had rainfall of varying degrees, and the mood of the farmers has basically stabilized.
　　However, there are still some problems in the current drought resistance in Southwest China: First, some rural cadres do not have enough understanding of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline and the significance of universal suffrage, and have ideological concerns, and dare not actively lead the masses, so that drought resistance work has not been carried out. Second, some cadres still have a booming style in drought resistance, failing to rely on and mobilize the masses, conduct in-depth investigation and research, and provide specific guidance, but only shout slogans and issue instructions. Third, relevant financial and economic departments such as cooperatives and banks have not actively cooperated with drought resistance and seedling protection, and carried out necessary procurement and sales work, so that the difficulties of farmers in production have not been resolved in time. These are all things that must be overcome and improved in future work in order to overcome the drought and strive to complete this year's task of increasing grain production.

    西南区各地农民进行抗旱保苗工作获成绩
    西南区入夏以来，普遍缺雨，各地都呈现旱象。四川全省有半数以上的县、云南省十二个专区中有七个专区的部分县、贵州省的十四个县及西康省的部分地区，都干旱缺雨。这些地区一般县有百分之二十至四十的秧田缺水，较严重的有百分之六十的秧田缺水，个别最严重的达百分之八十至九十。不少地区干田无法栽秧，栽下秧的田许多已干裂，有的红薯、玉米等作物已晒枯或干死。如四川省内江县有百分之六十的水田已干涸，贵州省金沙县有七万余亩田土干裂，二十三万余亩田无水栽秧。今年旱灾已严重影响了大秋作物的收成。
    旱象发生后，各地党、政领导机关都先后采取了紧急措施，大力领导群众抗旱保苗。六月十九日中共中央西南局向各级党委发出了“关于‘抗旱保苗’的紧急指示”后，各地领导机关更明确了“抗旱保苗”是当前农村压倒一切的中心任务。中共四川、贵州省委及重庆市委都发出了指示，具体布置了抗旱保苗工作。现在，凡旱象严重的地区，领导上大都改变了原来的工作计划，重新安排了工作。基层选举工作及反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪的斗争已停止和推迟，正在进行区、乡扩大干部会议和基层选举干部训练的县大都提前结束，抽调干部深入灾区领导抗旱工作。中共中央西南局最近已组织了两个工作队赴江津、达县两专区协助抗旱工作。中共四川省三台县委在县一级机关中抽调了干部一百七十多名，组成九个抗旱工作队，分别由县委书记、县长等负责干部亲自领导下乡工作。中共四川省遂宁地委除组织了工作组到各县帮助领导抗旱工作外，地委书记李林枝并亲自到灾区检查督促工作。许多县成立了“抗旱保苗”指挥部，由县委书记和县长亲自指挥，加强抗旱的领导工作。各地在抗旱保苗中，首先批判了干部和群众的错误思想，结合爱国主义教育，发动群众积极行动起来，采取了就地找水源等办法，并注意解决了抗旱中的评工、记分、合理用水等问题，开展了抗旱运动。中共四川省邛崃县委对群众抗旱中的口粮、工具等问题都作出了具体解决办法。云南省祥云县鹿鸣、洒把两乡农民在干了的河中和田角挖井，利用水源灌田，栽上了五百八十多亩田的秧子。玉溪县三区，转变了干部对抗旱的错误认识，用算细账、培养积极分子带头的办法，充分发动了群众，在半个月内新挖和整修塘、龙潭三百八十七口、支撑捍一百二十七架、水车一百四十八辆，救活了一万二千五百多亩秧苗。四川省遂宁县新立乡解决了合理用水和使用扎堰劳动力的问题，在十天中扎好了三十五座堰。有些地区机关干部、工厂、学校也帮助农民抗旱。四川省璧山县中共县委书记矫赵治同志领导党、政、军、机关及学校近万人帮助农民车水、挑水灌田。西南合作事业局、重庆前进灭火机器厂都把抽水机借给农民抽水救苗。在党和人民政府的领导下各地农民已积极行动起来进行抗旱保苗，最近一周来全区各地都下了大小不同程度的雨，农民情绪已基本上安定下来。
    但是目前西南区在抗旱中还存在一些问题：一、某些乡村干部对反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争和普选的意义认识不够，思想上有顾虑，不敢积极领导群众，以致抗旱工作没有展开。二、部分干部在抗旱中仍然存在着大轰大?的作风，没有依靠和发动群众，深入调查研究，进行具体领导，只是空喊口号和发指示。三、合作社、银行等有关财经部门，还没有积极配合抗旱保苗，进行必要的收购和推销工作，以致农民在生产上的困难没有得到及时解决。这些都是在今后工作中必须加以克服和改进的，以战胜旱灾，争取完成今年增产粮食的任务。（本报重庆记者站）
