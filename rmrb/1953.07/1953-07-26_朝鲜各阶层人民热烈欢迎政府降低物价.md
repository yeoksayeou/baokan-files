    朝鲜各阶层人民热烈欢迎政府降低物价
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜各地的国营商店与消费合作社已开始将生活必需品按降低后的价格出售。
    在平壤市，国营商店及其分店、流动销售队、郊区的消费合作社，在二十二日清晨开始按照减价后的价格出售棉布、鞋类及酒类等二十种生活必需品。国营商店和消费合作社的门口，市内各地布告牌和墙壁上，都贴满了减低物价的壁报和减价后的商品价格表。在堆满生活必需品的柜台之前，大批的顾客以便宜的价格在购买着质量好、样式多的物品。
    这几天以来，国营商店和消费合作社的销售额都有显著的增加。在金熙顿领导的商业管理所管辖下的几十个国营商店中，织物、鞋类等各种商品的销售额比减价以前都增加了好几倍。国营商店与消费合作社一部分生活必需品价格的降低，已开始影响了一般市场商品的价格。
    朝鲜各阶层人民热烈欢迎商品价格的降低。某工厂工人李昌业说：党和政府在战争时期接连采取降低物价的措施，安定和改善我们的生活。我们决心进一步积极完成生产计划，报答党和政府对我们的关怀。平壤中端里农民崔昌淳说：我们经常通过普遍设在农村中的消费合作社，买到廉价的工业品，保证了农业生产。由于这次的物价降低，我们的生活定会进一步得到安定和改善。家庭妇女杨善玉说：每逢党和政府采取这样的措施，我就深深地感到生活在人民政权之下的光荣和幸福。我们要对敬爱的领袖表示深深的感谢。
