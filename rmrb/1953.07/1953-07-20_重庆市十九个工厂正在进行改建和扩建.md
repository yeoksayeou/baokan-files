Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 19th - Nineteen local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Chongqing are currently undergoing reconstruction and expansion. The expansion project covers an area of over 37,000 square meters, with construction projects including factory buildings, warehouses, dormitories, and offices. In terms of equipment additions, the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant alone is adding fifty electrolytic cells, a bleaching powder tower, and a cooling ice truck. Regarding reconstruction projects, the factory buildings of some particularly rudimentary and labor-condition-poor local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Chongqing will be appropriately improved. For example, the former Qianjin Fire Extinguisher Factory, which produced nearly 100,000 fire extinguishers annually, had factory buildings originally constructed of bamboo strips. These will now be rebuilt into brick buildings seven times larger than the original. More than 90 percent of the reconstruction and expansion projects will be completed and put into production in the third quarter.

	After these local state-owned and joint state-private factories undergo reconstruction and expansion, their production efficiency will be greatly improved. This will play a certain role in further meeting the needs of national economic construction and satisfying the growing demands of the people's livelihood. After the completion of the expansion project of the Chongqing Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, the output of hydrochloric acid and caustic soda will increase by 50 percent. After the completion of the Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory project, the output of electric motors can also be increased by 45 percent, and the output of storage batteries can be increased by 50 percent. These products will supply the needs of papermaking, soap making, and other industries, as well as other basic construction departments in the Southwest region.

    重庆市十九个工厂正在进行改建和扩建
    【新华社重庆十九日电】重庆市有十九个地方国营和公私合营的工厂正在进行改建和扩建。扩建工程的面积共有三万七千多平方公尺，工程项目有厂房、仓库、宿舍、办公室的建筑；增添设备的仅天原电化厂就有五十个电解槽，一个漂粉塔和冷却冰车等。在改建工程方面，重庆市部分特别简陋和劳动条件较差的地方国营和公私合营的工厂厂房，将要得到适当的改善。像过去年产近十万个灭火机的前进灭火机厂，厂房原是竹篾捆扎的，现在将改建成比原来大七倍的砖房。在第三季度内，改建扩建工程将有百分之九十以上完工投入生产。
    这些地方国营和公私合营工厂经过改建和扩建以后，生产效率都将大大提高。这对进一步配合国家经济建设需要和满足不断增长的人民生活的要求将起一定作用。重庆市地方国营天原电化厂扩建工程完工以后，盐酸和烧碱的产量将可以增加百分之五十。重庆电工器材厂工程完工后，电动机的产量也可以提高百分之四十五，蓄电池的产量可以提高百分之五十。这些产品将供给西南地区造纸、制皂等工业和其他基本建设部门的需要。
