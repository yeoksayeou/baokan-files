Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: The Moscow Oblast Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol), together with Komsomol activists, held a joint plenary session on the 13th in the Column Hall of the House of Trade Unions to discuss the summary of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Mikhailov and Tretyakova, secretaries of the Moscow Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Kapitonov, secretary of the Moscow City Committee, also attended the meeting.

The meeting heard a report by Shelepin, secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol. The meeting clearly demonstrated the Komsomol members' boundless love for the Communist Party and the close unity of the Moscow Komsomol organization around the Party Central Committee. All those who spoke at the meeting warmly supported the resolute measures taken by the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU to expose and liquidate Beria's criminal activities. They angrily and contemptuously denounced the crimes of the bourgeois degenerate and agent of imperialism, Beria.

Rozhneva, a Stalin Prize winner and advanced worker at the Kubavin Fine Cloth Factory, said: All the staff of our factory felt extremely angry after learning about Beria's criminal activities. The staff of our factory unanimously supported the decisions of the Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Rozhneva emphasized: Let the enemies of the people know that we, the people, we, the youth, will unite more closely around the Communist Party and the Soviet government. This is our answer to the conspiracies of the agents of imperialism.

Those who reported and spoke at the meeting also criticized the shortcomings in the work of the Komsomol organizations. For example, some Komsomol organizations have not yet been able to implement the principle of collective leadership very well, and the phenomenon of underestimating ideological work has not been completely eliminated. Some people criticized the Moscow Oblast Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the Komsomol for lacking daily and flexible leadership over the Komsomol organizations. The Moscow Komsomol organization has serious shortcomings in observing intra-League democracy and the Komsomol Charter. Individual Komsomol district committees and city committees have violated the time limit for convening plenary sessions as stipulated in the Charter, and have failed to ensure the proper development of criticism and self-criticism.

The joint plenary session finally adopted a resolution unanimously supporting the decision of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU and determined ways to improve the work of the Komsomol organization. The resolution stated: "The joint plenary session of the Moscow Oblast Committee and the Moscow City Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, together with Komsomol activists, assures the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the Moscow Komsomol organization, which is infinitely loyal to the Communist Party, will unite its ranks more closely around the Party Central Committee, and, under the leadership of the Party organization, will mobilize the youth to struggle for the implementation of the Party's policy and for the realization of the grand plan of communist construction."

    苏联青年团莫斯科州委会、市委会和团的活动分子集会
    向苏共中央保证要紧密团结在党的周围
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联列宁共产主义青年团莫斯科州委员会和莫斯科市委员会，会同青年团活动分子，于十三日在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行联合全体会议，讨论苏共中央委员会全体会议的总结。苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会书记米哈伊洛夫和特列季亚科娃、莫斯科市委员会书记卡皮托诺夫也参加了会议。
    会议听取了青年团中央委员会书记谢列平的报告。会议显明地表现出青年团员对共产党的无限热爱，表现出莫斯科青年团组织紧密团结在党中央委员会的周围。所有在会上发言的人都热烈地拥护苏共中央委员会主席团为揭发和清算贝利亚的罪恶活动所采取的坚决措施。他们忿怒和鄙弃地痛斥了资产阶级蜕化分子、帝国主义的代理人贝利亚的罪行。
    斯大林奖金得奖人、库巴维因细呢工厂先进工人罗日聂娃说：我们工厂的全体工作人员，在知道了贝利亚的罪恶活动之后，都感到异常的忿怒。我们工厂的工作人员一致拥护党中央委员会全体会议和最高苏维埃主席团的决定。罗日聂娃强调说：要让人民的敌人知道，我们人民，我们青年们要更加紧密地团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围。这就是我们对帝国主义的代理人的阴谋的答复。
    在会上做报告和发言的人，都批评了青年团组织的工作缺点。例如，有些青年团组织还不能很好地贯彻集体领导的原则，对思想工作估价不足的现象还没有彻底清除。有些人批评青年团莫斯科州委员会和莫斯科市委员会对各青年团组织缺乏日常的、灵活的领导。莫斯科青年团组织在遵守团内民主和青年团团章方面，存在着严重的缺点。个别的青年团区委员会和市委员会竟违反团章所规定的召开全体会议的期限，没有保证展开应有的批评和自我批评。
    联合全体会议最后通过决议，一致拥护苏共中央委员会全体会议的决定，并定出了改进青年团组织的工作的办法。决议中说：“苏联列宁共产主义青年团莫斯科州委员会、莫斯科市委员会，会同青年团活动分子举行的联合全体会议，向苏联共产党中央委员会保证，对共产党无限忠诚的莫斯科青年团组织，要把自己的队伍更加紧密地团结在党中央委员会的周围，并在党组织的领导下，动员青年为贯彻党的政策，为实现共产主义建设的宏伟计划而奋斗。”
