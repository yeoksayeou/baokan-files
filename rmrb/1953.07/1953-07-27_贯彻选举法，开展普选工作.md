Implement the Election Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work

In Sichuan Province, most of the original grassroots cadres in the pilot townships for universal suffrage were elected as people's representatives.

In Sichuan Province’s pilot areas for grassroots elections, most of the original grassroots cadres, after being vetted by the masses, were supported by the masses and elected as people's representatives. According to statistics from five townships that completed grassroots elections in June: a total of 231 township people's representatives were elected, of which 181 were original grassroots cadres, accounting for 80% of the total number of representatives. Original grassroots cadres also accounted for a large proportion of the various organizations established after the universal suffrage. For example, in Hesheng Township, Wenjiang County, original cadres who were elected as representatives or continued to serve as members or other positions in the various standing committees of the township people's government accounted for more than 82% of the total.

Most of these original cadres in these areas were activists who emerged during the rent reduction and interest rate reduction, land reform, and the Resist America, Aid Korea movements. They generally worked for more than a year and achieved certain results. The masses clearly saw that they were reliable backbones in implementing the people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas. About 20% of the cadres were of good character, worked hard, and were actively responsible, earning the support of the masses. The masses called these cadres "locomotive cadres." During the universal suffrage, voters said, "If we don't elect them, who else should we elect?" For example, Ye Zhengui, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Gelan Township, Changshou County, helped the masses solve production difficulties and promoted advanced farming methods, earning the heartfelt support of the masses. When the candidates for representatives were being discussed, everyone said he was "fully qualified and needs no discussion." As a result, he was elected as a township people's representative with a large majority of votes and was also elected as the deputy township head by everyone.

The masses also vetted the remaining cadres. About 60% of the cadres were of good character, worked actively and diligently, but had some minor problems in their ideology and work style, or had some shortcomings in their work. The masses believed that they were basically good cadres, affirmed their past work achievements, but also pointed out their shortcomings. In improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, the masses offered sincere criticisms and suggestions. These cadres also humbly accepted the opinions and expressed their determination to correct their shortcomings. The masses said, "As long as they can correct their shortcomings, we will still elect them." For example, Xiong Yanqing, director of the representative of Yakou Village, Shuanglong Township, Jiangjin County, was active and responsible in his work. During the universal suffrage, everyone nominated him as a candidate for representative, while also pointing out his blunt attitude. After Xiong Yanqing voluntarily reviewed himself to everyone, the masses expressed their satisfaction, and more than three-quarters of the voters voted for him. In addition, there were a very small number of cadres who were nominal and ineffective or had an improper work style. The masses were unwilling to elect them again and instead selected a group of activists as people's representatives.

In these areas where pilot grassroots elections were conducted, the relationship between cadres and the masses was further strengthened. The elected cadres are working with the masses to carry out summer agricultural activities. (Xinhua News Agency)

Universal Suffrage Movement in the Old Revolutionary Base Area of Sichuan and Shaanxi

On June 19, 90.4% of the voters in Chengshou Township, Bazhong County, the old revolutionary base area of Sichuan and Shaanxi, participated in the election. This universal suffrage was carried out during the tense summer farming season. The people of the whole township conducted the universal suffrage activities in an enthusiastic and serious atmosphere. During the process of discussing the candidates for representatives, such a thing happened in Qinglong Village. Wei, an old man who weaves mats, usually goes to the market and rarely attends meetings. He received education in the universal suffrage. One day, this old man wanted to talk to Luo Shizhe, a farmer in the village, about the universal suffrage and test the other party's understanding of the universal suffrage. He deliberately said that he had no opinion on who to choose as a representative. Luo Shizhe was very busy that day. In the past, if Wei, the old man, said such a thing, he would pretend not to hear it, but today he was angry: "Old man! Why do you say that! Election is our own business. If we elect bad people, we will suffer! Old man! I'll tell you honestly, I think about it day and night: only Luo Dengxi and Wang Jiapei in our Qinglong Village can be representatives. Others are not qualified." Luo Yingxiang, who was standing next to him, continued: "Old man, if you elect a bad person, you will waste that vote!"

When Group One of this village nominated candidates for representatives, only six old people, disabled people, and a woman who had just given birth did not come out of the 84 voters. A few days before the election, the women prepared pigweed to avoid being busy at the last minute and delaying things. Old women in their seventies and eighties also walked through the mountain slope road of four or five miles to attend the election meeting. Yan Dalu, a farmer in a village, discussed with his wife the night before the election meeting to eat earlier the next day. Liu Tianshou, from Nanba Village, usually did not like women going to meetings. On the day of the election meeting, they both arrived early.

The people of the old revolutionary base area regard this universal suffrage as the victory of their struggle. Wang Yuling, a woman who was elected as a representative of the Eleventh Village, served as the women's committee member of the township Soviet in 1933. In the struggle to fight local tyrants and distribute land, she mobilized women to report and capture a hidden Kuomintang officer. After the Red Army went north to fight against Japan, she was imprisoned by the Kuomintang for 40 days and suffered a lot. At the beginning of liberation, she assisted the people's government in surveying fields and assessing production, and broke through the conspiracy of the Kuomintang Baojia personnel to collectively conceal fields in Namba Village, Chengshou, which smoothly promoted the work at that time. Today, she is very happy to participate in the election. She told the staff: "We should participate in the universal suffrage well and master the political power well, so that the motherland can be built well, and we will not fail Chairman Mao's wishes." Her words represent the wishes of the people in the old revolutionary base area.

In the universal suffrage, people often talk about the past despicable and shameless elections of the Kuomintang. At that time, Feng Junlian, the head of the Xin faction, a powerful feudal faction in Bazhong County, supported their leader Feng Junlian as a legislator and forced the people to elect him. The Kuomintang agents also brought guns to coerce. A resident living in Chengdong at that time was kicked several times by the agents because he glanced at other people's votes. Some farmers in Qinglong Village were beaten for not electing the bully Luo Quanhua. Comparing the Kuomintang's "election" with today's universal suffrage, they felt that today is so democratic, and they felt that they have indeed become the masters of their own affairs, so they are more active and enthusiastic in the universal suffrage.

The First Batch of Township Universal Suffrage Pilot Work Begins in Ya'an and Other Counties in Xikang Province

The first batch of grassroots universal suffrage work has begun in Xichang Prefecture, Ya'an Province, and Lushan, Baoxing, Tianquan, and Luding counties. The Xichang Prefecture Election Committee Guidance Office made preparations for allocating cadres as early as early June, and assigned the cadres to various counties. The first batch of grassroots elections was conducted on June 20 in 171 townships that had basically completed rice transplanting.

Before the start of the universal suffrage work in Ya'an, Baoxing, and Tianquan counties, cadres were organized to study relevant election documents in the expanded cadre meetings held in early and mid-June. Luding County specifically gathered 152 cadres participating in the first batch of township universal suffrage work from June 3 to 19 for study. During the study, some cadres criticized the wrong understanding of universal suffrage. Generally, they realized the great significance of universal suffrage and studied how to closely integrate production with universal suffrage activities.

The pilot work of grassroots universal suffrage in Sichuan Province, cities, and counties basically ended at the end of June. The first batch of grassroots universal suffrage in the province will also begin in early July. At present, district, township, and village cadres, election guidance cadres, and technical cadres are being actively trained. (Our reporter station in Chongqing)

### 贯彻选举法，开展普选工作

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    四川省普选试办乡原有基层干部大多数当选为人民代表
    四川省基层选举典型试办地区的原有基层干部，经过群众鉴别后，大多数获得群众拥护，当选为人民代表。据六月份完成基层选举的五个乡的材料统计：此次共选出乡人民代表二百三十一人，其中原有基层干部共一百八十一人，占代表总数百分之八十。经过普选后建立的各种组织中，原有基层干部也占很大比例。如温江县和盛乡的原有干部，这次当选为代表或继续在乡人民政府各种常设委员会等组织中担任委员及其它职务的，共占总数百分之八十二强。
    这些地区的原有干部，大部分是在减租退押、土地改革、抗美援朝等运动中涌现出来的积极分子，一般都工作了一年以上，并有一定成绩。群众清楚地看到：他们是农村中实行人民民主专政的可靠骨干。约占总数百分之二十以上的干部，品质好，劳动好，工作积极负责，受到群众的拥戴。群众称这一些干部为“火车头干部”，在普选中，选民们说：“不选他们选谁？”如长寿县葛兰乡农会主席叶蓁贵，曾经帮助群众解决生产困难，推广先进耕作方法，群众衷心拥戴。酝酿代表候选人时，大家说他“完全合格，不用讨论”。结果以绝大多数票当选为乡人民代表，又被大家推举为该乡副乡长。
    群众对于其余的干部也作了鉴别。约占总数百分之六十左右的干部，品质好，工作积极肯干；但思想作风上还有一些小毛病，或是工作上还存在一些缺点，群众认为他们基本上是好干部，肯定了他们过去的工作成绩，但也指出了缺点。在改善干部与群众关系中，群众提出了善意的批评和建议。这些干部也都虚心地接受了意见，并表示了改正缺点的决心。群众说：“有缺点只要能改，我们还是要选他们。”例如江津县双龙乡垭口村代表主任熊焱清，工作积极负责，普选中大家提他当代表候选人，同时指出他态度生硬的缺点。熊焱清自动向大家检讨后，群众表示满意，四分之三以上的选民又投了他的票。此外，还有极少数的干部，是挂名不起作用或作风不正派的，群众就不愿意再选他们，而另行挑选一批积极分子当人民代表。
    这些经过基层选举典型试办的地区，干部和群众的关系进一步密切了。当选的干部正和群众一道，进行夏季农事活动。（新华社）
    普选运动在川陕老根据地
    六月十九日，川陕老根据地巴中县城守乡的选民百分之九十点四都参加了选举。这次普选是在紧张的夏季农忙中进行的。全乡的人民对普选活动一直是在热情和严肃的气氛下进行的。在酝酿代表候选人的过程中，青龙村曾发生这样一回事。一个编席子的魏老汉，平时常赶场、很少参加会议。在普选中他受到了教育。一天，这个老汉想和本村农民雒世哲扯一扯普选的事，试探一下对方对普选的认识。他故意说不论选那一个当代表都没意见。雒世哲这天本来很忙，要是在平时，魏老汉说这样的话，他就假装没有听见，但，今天他生气了：“老汉！你怎么这样说！选举是我们自己的事，选上不好的人，我们就要吃亏！老汉！我老实告诉你，我白天黑夜都在想：我们青龙村只有雒登喜和王家丕能当代表，其他人都不够格。”站在旁边的罗映祥也接着说：“老汉，选了不好的人，就可惜了那张票！”
    这个村一组在提代表候选人时，八十四个选民只有六个老人、残废和一个生了孩子的女人没有到。选举前几天，妇女们就准备好猪草，免得临时再忙，耽误事。七八十岁的老太婆也穿过四五里远的山坡路赶去参加选举大会。一村农民晏大禄在选举大会召开的头一天晚上，就和老婆商量第二天要早些吃饭。南坝村有一个叫刘天寿的，平时不满意女人去开会，开选举大会的这天，他俩一早就到了。
    老根据地人民把这次普选当作自己斗争的胜利成果来看。十一村当选代表的妇女王玉灵，一九三三年作过乡苏维埃妇女委员，在打土豪分土地的斗争中，曾发动妇女检举和捕捉过隐藏的一个国民党军官。红军北上抗日后，她被国民党囚了四十天，受过很多苦。解放之初，她协助人民政府搞查田评产，在城守南坝村突破伪保甲人员集体瞒田的阴谋，使当时的工作顺利推进。今天她来参加选举，有说不出的高兴。她告诉工作人员：“我们好好参加普选，好好掌握政权，祖国才能建设得好，也才不辜负毛主席的心愿。”她的话代表了老根据地人民的意愿。
    在普选中，人们也常谈起过去国民党的卑鄙无耻的选举。那时巴中县一个有势力的封建派门——新派支持他们的头子冯均琏当立法委员，还逼迫人民选他，国民党的特务也带枪来威逼。现在城东住的一个居民，当时因为看了一下别人的选票，就被特务狠踢了几脚。青龙村有些农民因为不选恶霸雒全华，也曾挨过打。他们把国民党的“选举”和今天的普选对比，更感到今天是多么的民主，感到自己确已当家作主，因而在普选中更加活跃、热情。

    西康省雅安等县第一批乡普选试办工作开始
    西康省西昌专区及雅安、芦山、宝兴、天全、泸定等县已开始第一批乡的基层普选工作。西昌专区选举委员会指导办公室，早在六月上旬就作好了配备干部的准备工作，并把干部分派到各县。第一批基层选举已于六月二十日在一百七十一个基本完成插秧工作的乡进行。雅安、宝兴、天全等三县普选
    工作开始之前，均在六月上、中旬召开的扩大干部会议中，组织干部进行了有关选举文件的学习。泸定县在六月三日至十九日专门集中参加第一批乡普选工作的干部一百五十二人进行了学习。在学习中，某些干部批判了对普选的错误认识，一般都认识到普选的重大意义，并研究了如何紧密结合生产进行普选活动。
    四川省、市、县基层普选试点工作已于六月底基本结束，全省第一批基层普选也将在七月初开始，目前正积极训练区、乡、村干部及选举指导干部和技术干部。（本报重庆记者站）
