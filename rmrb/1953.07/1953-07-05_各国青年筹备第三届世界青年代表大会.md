Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Young men and women from all countries are busy preparing for the Third World Youth Congress, scheduled to open in Bucharest on the 25th of this month.
    Youth from various countries have held various gatherings to elect representatives to the Congress. French youth first held gatherings in factories or residential areas, followed by regional conferences to elect representatives to the Congress. The first batch of representatives elected by British youth is broadly representative, including representatives of the Student Labour Federation, representatives of the Communist Youth League, representatives of the Edinburgh Christian Workers' Alliance, and representatives of miners from Wales, Ireland, and Derber. Swedish youth and trade union organizations are electing representatives to the Congress. Belgian student and young writer organizations have already elected their representatives. In the Middle East and Latin America, national youth organizations in some countries are making contact to prepare to send joint delegations to the Congress. Church youth organizations in India, Indonesia, and other countries are also preparing to send observers to the Congress. Delegations from Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Panama, and other countries have set off for Bucharest. Namazon, Secretary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, said at a recent press conference in Bucharest that it is estimated that 1,000 delegates, 500 observers, and 50 guests will attend the Congress. Youth organizations not affiliated with the World Federation of Democratic Youth will also send representatives to the Congress.
    In the process of preparing for the Congress, young people from different strata and with different political views in capitalist countries gathered together to broadly discuss their own problems and put forward their common demands. French, Italian, and British youth broadly discussed issues such as youth solidarity and defending youth rights at gatherings to elect representatives to the Congress. West German youth are preparing a petition in which they demand that the Bonn "government" increase budget allocations to build 110 vocational schools, trade schools, and student dormitories. Youth from all over Finland have also gathered to discuss demands to be made to the government, and they will present their plans at the World Youth Congress. Ceylon youth held their Second Youth Congress at the end of May, and the Congress passed resolutions demanding the improvement of the social and political status of youth, which they will also present at the World Youth Congress.
