Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party, presented the Communist Party's ten-point agricultural program at the meeting. The German Communist Party believes that the alliance of workers and peasants is the driving force for solving the urgent problems of the German nation. The ten-point program includes: allocating land exceeding 100 acres to landless peasants; immediately ceasing the confiscation of farmers' land and returning land that has already been requisitioned; and fully compensating all losses, including those caused by (military) exercises. The German Communist Party's program also calls for stopping expenditures on remilitarization and increased occupation costs, and using a considerable portion of the money saved to help farmers through tax cuts and lower prices.

Reimann emphasized that the Communist Party believes that the alliance of workers and peasants is the driving force for eliminating the national disaster of the German people.

The Communist Party's program was warmly welcomed by the meeting's representatives.
