We Recognize How to Safeguard the Fundamental Interests of the Working Class
Li Shisen Sun Keting, Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China
We two are trade union workers, and we feel that one of the reasons why workers' lax labor discipline has not been corrected for a long time is that trade union cadres have not made educating workers to establish a conscious labor attitude a regular part of communist education.

Looking at the work of our textile union system, we have been working hard in the past few years to safeguard the interests of the working class and care for the lives of the workers. However, many of our comrades still have a vague understanding of what it means to safeguard the fundamental interests of the working class and what it means to care for the lives of the workers when dealing with specific issues. Therefore, they often do not see problems comprehensively and have a short-sighted view. For example, regarding the issue of labor discipline, trade unions in various factories rarely encouraged or praised workers who abided by labor discipline in the past; they also rarely criticized and educated workers who did not abide by labor discipline, especially those who could not correct their shortcomings for a long time. Everyone felt that there was nothing that could be done about them, so they were ignored. Sometimes, when the administrative side wanted to punish individual workers who seriously violated labor discipline, trade union cadres disagreed, feeling that if they agreed to the administrative punishment of workers who violated labor discipline, they would be "losing their stand"; some trade union cadres even formed opposition to the administrative side on this issue. This not only created a very bad influence among the workers, but also objectively contributed to the growth of some workers' ideas of not abiding by labor discipline. Last year, the attendance rate of state-owned cotton textile factories only reached 89 percent, and there were too many absent workers, so the workshops could not operate at full capacity, which seriously affected production. When the administrative side raised the issue of some workers not abiding by labor discipline, the trade union admitted that education was insufficient, but always emphasized that it was "only an individual phenomenon" and did not pay attention to it, so it did not make efforts to carry out education. Recently, the state-owned Tianjin First Cotton Textile Factory investigated 133 workers who were frequently absent and found that 79 of them were often absent without reason, and 39 of them had very minor illnesses, but could still come to work. The investigation by the First Factory proved that not abiding by labor discipline was not just an individual issue. It is indeed a fact that the trade union's education for workers is insufficient.

After studying the experience of Factory 53 and the documents of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, the cotton textile factories' trade unions conducted labor discipline education for the workers. After preliminary education, workers who did not abide by labor discipline in the past began to realize their errors, and the attendance rate of various factories has risen. The average in May reached 92.2 percent. Many transformed workers began to establish a new labor attitude.

Facts have proved that trade union workers in our state-owned enterprises should, under the unified leadership of the Party, continuously educate workers, especially those backward workers, with patience, and improve their consciousness through mass criticism and self-criticism. Individual elements who have consistently seriously violated labor discipline and have not reformed despite repeated education should be given the disciplinary sanctions they deserve. Only when the trade union earnestly carries out communist education among the workers and constantly strengthens the organization and discipline of the broad masses of workers can a new labor order be established in the factory, can production be continuously improved, and can the lives of workers be continuously improved. Only by doing this can the trade union be said to be safeguarding the fundamental interests of the working class.

    我们认清了怎样才是维护工人阶级的根本利益
    中国纺织工会天津市委员会  李世森  孙克庭
    我们两个人是工会工作者，我们觉得：工人劳动纪律松弛，长期不能得到纠正的原因之一，是工会干部没有把教育工人树立自觉的劳动态度，作为经常的共产主义教育的一项内容。
    从我们纺织工会系统的工作来看，几年来我们都在为维护工人阶级的利益、关心工人的生活而努力工作着。但是究竟怎样才算维护了工人阶级的根本利益，怎样才算关心工人的生活，我们不少同志在处理一些具体问题时，还表现出认识不清，因而往往看问题不很全面，眼光短浅。比如：关于劳动纪律问题，各厂工会以前对遵守劳动纪律的工人，很少加以鼓励和表扬；对不遵守劳动纪律的工人，也很少进行批评和教育，特别是对那些长期不能纠正自己缺点的工人，大家都认为没有什么办法，也就不管他。有时行政方面要处分个别严重破坏劳动纪律的工人，工会干部就不同意，觉得如果同意行政上处分违犯劳动纪律的工人就是“失掉立场”；有的工会干部甚至在这个问题上和行政方面形成对立。这样不仅在工人群众中造成很坏的影响，客观上也助长了某些工人不遵守劳动纪律的思想的滋长。去年各国营棉纺厂的出勤率只达到百分之八十九，欠勤工人太多，车间里开不齐车，严重地影响了生产。行政方面提出部分工人不遵守劳动纪律的问题，工会虽承认教育不够，但总强调说：“只是个别现象”，并未引起重视，因而也未抓紧进行教育。最近国营天津第一棉纺织厂调查了一百三十三个经常欠勤的工人，发现其中七十九个人常常无故欠勤，其中三十九个人虽有很轻微的病，但都可以上班工作。一厂的调查证明：不遵守劳动纪律的并不是个别人。工会对工人的教育不够，确是事实。
    经过学习五三工厂的经验及中国工会第七次全国代表大会的文件，棉纺各厂工会都向工人进行了劳动纪律的教育。经过初步的教育，过去不遵守劳动纪律的工人就开始觉悟了，各厂的出勤率已见上升，五月份平均已达到百分之九十二点二。许多转变了的工人开始树立了新的劳动态度。
    事实证明：我们国营企业的工会工作者，应在党的统一领导下，不断地向工人进行教育，特别是对那些少数落后工人更要耐心教育，通过群众性的批评与自我批评，提高他们的觉悟；对个别一贯严重破坏劳动纪律而屡教不改的分子，应给予应得的纪律制裁。只有工会认真地向工人进行共产主义的教育，不断地增强广大工人群众的组织性和纪律性，才能在工厂中建立起新的劳动秩序，才能使生产不断提高、工人生活不断改善。只有这样作，工会才算维护了工人阶级的根本的利益。
