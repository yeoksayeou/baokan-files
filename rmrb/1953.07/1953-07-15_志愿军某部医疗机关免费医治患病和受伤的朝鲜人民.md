Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 14th: A medical unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Kaesong front is enthusiastically providing medical treatment to local Korean people suffering from illnesses and injuries. In the past six months, they have treated over 3,400 Korean people who were sick or injured by bombs and shells from the American aggressor troops. Treatment and medicine are free of charge.

The medical unit always considers the needs of the Korean people. With the assistance of the local Korean government, they have established "mass medical stations" in areas with larger populations, enabling sick and injured Korean people to receive timely and convenient medical care. The medical stations also frequently send medical teams to distant villages to treat illnesses and provide maternity care, as well as to conduct epidemic prevention and health education for residents.

Chinese People's Volunteer Army medical personnel regard treating Korean people as a glorious duty, and demonstrate a high degree of internationalist spirit in their work. Kang Yimin, the head of the surgical team, transfused his own blood to a child injured by enemy shells. Doctor Cui Shitu treated a little girl suffering from meningitis, visiting her home several times a day until he finally cured the little girl, who had been unable to speak. Song Xingze's daughter-in-law was in labor for five days without delivering the baby, and her life was in danger, causing the whole family to cry in distress. Doctor Zhao Zhongxin of the "mass medical station" rushed to the rescue after learning about the situation, and left a nurse to specifically care for the mother. The baby was safely delivered that night, bringing great joy to Song Xingze's entire family.

    志愿军某部医疗机关免费医治患病和受伤的朝鲜人民
    【新华社朝鲜前线十四日电】开城前线中国人民志愿军某部医疗机关热情地为当地朝鲜人民医治疾病和创伤，半年来已医好了三千四百多个患病和被美国侵略军的炸弹、炮弹炸伤的朝鲜人民。治疗和医药都是免费的。
    某部医疗机关总是热情地为朝鲜人民着想。他们在当地朝鲜政府的协助下，分别在居民较多的地方设立了“群众医疗所”，使患病和受伤的朝鲜人民及时而方便地得到医疗。医疗所还经常派出医疗小组到较远的各村去治病和为产妇接生，并向居民进行防疫卫生宣传。
    中国人民志愿军医务人员都把为朝鲜人民治病作为光荣职责，在工作中发扬了高度的国际主义精神。手术组组长康毅民将自己的血输给一位被敌人炮弹打伤的儿童。医生崔世图在治疗一个患脑膜炎的小姑娘时，每天几次到她家里去看她，终于把这个已经不能说话的小姑娘治好。居民宋兴泽的儿媳临产，五天没有把孩子生下来，生命垂危，急得全家都哭起来。“群众医疗所”的医生赵仲信知道这件事情后，马上赶去急救，并留下护士专门照顾产妇，当天夜里婴儿就平安地出世了，宋兴泽全家欢天喜地。
