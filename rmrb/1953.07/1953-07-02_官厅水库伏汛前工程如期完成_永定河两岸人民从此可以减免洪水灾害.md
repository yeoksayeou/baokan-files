Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River, the largest reservoir in New China, has completed all its pre-flood season projects as scheduled, ensuring flood control and enabling the people on both banks of the Yongding River to be spared from flood disasters.

    Based on last year's project, the Guanting Reservoir project started large-scale construction this spring. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the full play of the enthusiasm, creativity and initiative of 40,000 employees, coupled with the support from all over the country and the help of Soviet water conservancy experts, after only three months of intense construction, at 11:00 p.m. on June 29th, the dam was built to a height of 35 meters, successfully completing the pre-flood season flood control project plan. Now the dam stands firmly at the entrance of the Guanting Gorge like a mountain. It will block the path of the flood, so that the torrent of the Yongding River will obey people's will and flow down the water diversion tunnel docilely. Even if the Yongding River has a flood as large as in 1939, farmers on both sides will not suffer from flood disasters.
    From the start of construction in October 1951 to the present, one year and eight months, in addition to the construction of the dam, major projects such as water diversion channels and spillways have also been carried out. A total of more than 480,000 cubic meters of earth and stone have been excavated, more than 32,000 cubic meters of concrete have been poured, more than 4,000 meters have been drilled, and more than 770 holes have been grouted. In order to divert water and build dams, the 495.5-meter-long water diversion tunnel was completed as early as last year. The stilling basin project at the exit of the water diversion tunnel was also completed on June 13 this year. It can reduce the kinetic energy of the rapid flow from the tunnel and avoid scouring the riverbed.
    The preparatory work for construction was also huge. Starting in 1950, the earth and stone work for building traffic roads reached 742,000 cubic meters, equivalent to three-quarters of the total amount of the dam project. The 300-meter-long temporary cofferdam used a total of 81,000 cubic meters of earth and stone. A total of 120 kilometers of light rail was laid on the construction site for transporting materials, and 2,100 meters of wooden bridges were erected. More than 100,000 square meters of houses and sheds were built on the construction site. During the one year and eight months of construction, after two spring floods and two flood seasons, many wooden bridges and light rails were dismantled and laid four times, still ensuring that the major projects were constructed according to plan.

### 官厅水库伏汛前工程如期完成  永定河两岸人民从此可以减免洪水灾害

    官厅水库伏汛前工程如期完成
    永定河两岸人民从此可以减免洪水灾害
    【新华社一日讯】新中国容积最大的水库——永定河官厅水库伏汛前工程全部如期完成，可确保拦阻洪水，使永定河两岸的人民从此减免洪水灾害。
    官厅水库工程在去年工程基础上，今春开始大规模施工，由于共产党的正确领导和四万员工劳动积极性创造性的充分发挥，加上全国各地的支援和苏联水利专家的帮助，经过短短三个月的紧张施工，在六月二十九日午后十一时，拦河坝已修筑到三十五公尺高，胜利完成伏汛前拦洪工程计划。现在拦河坝像一座山稳立在官厅山峡的进口，它将拦阻住洪水的去路，使永定河的巨流听从人们的意志，驯服地通过输水隧道顺流而下。即使永定河再发生一九三九年那样大的洪水，两岸农民也不会遭受洪水灾害。
    官厅水库从一九五一年十月间开工到现在一年零八个月里，除了拦河坝修筑工程外，同时进行了输水道和溢洪道等主要工程，开挖土方和石方共四十八万多公方，浇筑混凝土三万二千多公方，钻孔共深四千多公尺，并灌浆七百七十多孔。为了导水筑坝，长达四百九十五点五公尺的输水隧洞早在去年就已完成。输水隧洞出口的静水池工程，也在今年六月十三日完工，它可消减从隧洞出来的急流的动能，避免河槽被冲刷。
    为施工而进行的准备工程也很大。从一九五○年开始，修建交通道路的土方和石方共达七十四万二千公方，等于拦河坝全部工程量的四分之三。三百公尺长的临时挡水坝，共用土、石八万一千公方。为运输料物在工地上铺设的轻便铁道共一百二十公里，架设木桥二千一百公尺。工地上建造的房屋和工棚共十万多平方公尺。在一年零八个月的施工中，经过两次春汛和两次伏汛，许多木桥和轻便铁道经过四次的拆除和铺设，依然保证了各项主要工程按计划施工。
