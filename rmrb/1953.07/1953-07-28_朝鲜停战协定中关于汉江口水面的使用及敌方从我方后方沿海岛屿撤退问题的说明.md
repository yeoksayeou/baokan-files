Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 27th. The two provisions in the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the use of the Han River estuary waters and the withdrawal of enemy forces from coastal islands behind our lines are two relatively special issues, and are hereby introduced separately as follows:

    I. Article 5 of the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates: "The waters of the Han River estuary, where one bank is controlled by one side and the other bank is controlled by the other side, shall be open to civil navigation by both sides. ... Civilian navigation by each side shall not be restricted from landing on land under its own military control."

    The Han River originates from Mount Odae in eastern Korea, flows north through Seoul and Gimpo, joins the Imjin River, and then flows east to west into the Yellow Sea. The Han River from the confluence of the Han River and the Imjin River to the estuary is approximately 70 kilometers long. From November 1951, our side and the enemy side formed a situation of confrontation across the river in this area, with our side controlling the north bank of the Han River and the enemy side controlling the south bank of the Han River. The Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that the military demarcation line determined according to the actual line of contact between the two sides is on the Han River water surface between the two sides.

    The residents on both sides of the Han River estuary mostly made a living from shipping and fishing before the outbreak of the Korean War. After the cessation of the war, the Han River estuary waters should be opened to civil navigation, and local residents should be given conditions to restore peaceful life. However, during the negotiations, the enemy attempted to use the Han River estuary waters for military navigation, proposing the claim of "opening to all navigation by both sides," which not only made it impossible to guarantee the stability of the armistice, but also endangered civil navigation. With our opposition and persistent efforts, the two sides finally reached an agreement to open the Han River estuary waters to civil navigation by both sides, so that the issue of the use of the Han River estuary waters was reasonably resolved.

    II. Paragraph C of Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates: Within ten days after this Armistice Agreement becomes effective, the commanders of both sides shall withdraw all their military forces, supplies, and equipment from the rear and coastal islands and waters of the other side in Korea. Regarding the withdrawal from coastal islands, the enemy made many unreasonable demands during the negotiation process, unwilling to withdraw from the coastal islands behind our lines with the military demarcation line as the boundary after the armistice, and strongly demanded that we compensate for the islands that they should withdraw with equivalent land in Kaesong, based on the reason that certain islands were under their control. Our side resolutely opposed this unreasonable demand by the enemy, and insisted that the boundary between the two sides should be the line extending from the Imjin River estuary at the western end of the military demarcation line along the center of the Han River and the boundary between the Hwanghae and Gyeonggi provinces to the sea. All islands located north of the military demarcation line and this provincial boundary must be evacuated by the other side. After our persistence and efforts, the two sides finally reached an agreement on the island withdrawal, that is, the provisions of item C of Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement: All islands north and west of the boundary between Hwanghae Province and Gyeonggi Province, except for Baengnyeong Island, Daecheong Island, Socheong Island, Yeonpyeong Island, and Udo, which remain under the control of the other side, shall be evacuated by the other side within ten days after the Armistice Agreement takes effect and placed under our military control. All islands located south of the above-mentioned boundary shall remain under the military control of the other side. There was no dispute between the two sides in the negotiations regarding the withdrawal from the islands on the east coast of Korea. After the armistice, the enemy will withdraw within ten days after the agreement takes effect from the islands controlled by our side on June 24, 1950, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, Paragraph C of the Armistice Agreement.

    According to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, the main coastal islands that the enemy should withdraw from behind our lines after the Korean Armistice include Chodo, Seokdo, Wolnae Island, Girin Island, and Changrin Island on the west coast of Korea, and Yeodo, Ungdo, and Sindo on the east coast of Korea. These islands are now all occupied by the Li pseudo-army and the US-Li special agents. The Armistice Agreement stipulates: If such military forces fail to withdraw within ten days after the Armistice Agreement takes effect, and there is no mutually agreed and valid reason for extending the withdrawal, the other party has the right to take any action it deems necessary to maintain order.

    朝鲜停战协定中关于汉江口水面的使用及敌方从我方后方沿海岛屿撤退问题的说明
    【新华社开城二十七日电】朝鲜停战协定中关于汉江口水面的使用及敌方从我方后方沿海岛屿撤退的两项规定，是两个比较特殊的问题，现特分别介绍如下：
    一、朝鲜停战协定第五款规定：“汉江口的水面，其一岸受一方控制而另一岸受他方控制处，向双方民用航运开放。……各方民用航运在本方军事控制下的陆地靠岸不受限制。”
    汉江发源于朝鲜东部五台山，经汉城、金浦北流与临津江汇合，然后由东向西流入黄海。汉江与临津江汇合口至入海处的汉江，长约七十公里，从一九五一年十一月起，我方与敌方即在这一地区形成隔江对峙的局势，我方控制汉江北岸地区，敌方控制汉江南岸地区。朝鲜停战协定规定，按双方实际接触线确定的军事分界线即在双方之间的汉江水面上。
    汉江口两岸的居民在朝鲜战争爆发前多以航运和捕鱼为生，战争停止后应将汉江口水面向民用航运开放，并给予当地居民以恢复和平生活的条件。但在谈判过程中，敌方企图把汉江口水面用于军事航运，提出“向双方一切航运开放”的主张，不仅使停战的稳定无法得到保证，而且同样危及民用航运。在我方的反对及坚持努力下，双方终于达成了汉江口水面向双方民用航运开放的协议。使汉江口水面使用问题，得到了合理的解决。
    二、朝鲜停战协定第十三款丑项规定：双方司令官在本停战协定生效后十天内自对方在朝鲜的后方与沿海岛屿及海面撤出其一切军事力量、供应与装备。沿海岛屿的撤退问题，在谈判过程中敌方曾提出许多无理要求，不愿在停战后以军事分界线为界从我方后方的沿海岛屿撤退，并强以某些岛屿在其控制下为理由，要求我方以开城的相当土地抵偿其应该撤退的岛屿。我方对敌方此种无理要求给予了坚决反对，坚持以军事分界线西端临津江口沿汉江中心和黄海、京畿两道道界的线延伸到海上为双方界线，凡位于军事分界线及此道界以北所有的岛屿，对方必须撤出。经我方的坚持和努力，最后双方达成了关于岛屿撤退的协议，即停战协定第十三款丑项规定：在黄海道与京畿道道界以北及以西的岛屿，除白翎岛、大青岛、小青岛、延坪岛及隅岛留置对方的控制下以外，其它的一切岛屿均由对方在停战协定生效后十天内撤出，置于我方的军事控制之下。位于上述界线以南的一切岛屿均留置对方的军事控制之下。朝鲜东海岸岛屿的撤退，在谈判中双方未有争执。停战后，敌方将按照停战协定十三款丑项的规定，在一九五零年六月二十四日为我方控制的岛屿，在协定生效后十天内撤退。
    按照停战协定的规定，朝鲜停战后，敌方应自我方后方撤退的沿海主要岛屿，朝鲜西岸有椒岛、席岛、月乃岛、麒麟岛、昌麟岛等，朝鲜东岸有丽岛、熊岛、薪岛等。这些岛屿现在全部为李伪军和美李特务所盘据。停战协定规定：如此等军事力量在停战协定生效后十天内逾期不撤，又无双方同意的和有效的延期撤出
    的理由，则对方为维持治安，有权采取任何其
    所认为必要的行动。
