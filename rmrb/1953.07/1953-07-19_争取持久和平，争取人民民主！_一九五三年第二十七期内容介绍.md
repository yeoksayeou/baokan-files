An introduction to the contents of the twenty-seventh issue of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers’ Parties’ organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, which has already been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Soviet Union – The Pillar of Peace and Security for All Peoples." The editorial points out that the various nationalities of the Soviet Union are executing the grand plans for economic and cultural construction formulated by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with boundless confidence and enthusiasm. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the great guiding and leading force of Soviet society; the steel-like unity and rock-solid consolidation of the Communist Party are the basic prerequisites for its strength and power, and all its activities are in line with the vital interests of the working people. The policies formulated by the Communist Party have been tested in decades of struggle. The foreign policy of the Soviet Union is cordial to all peace-loving people. It is a policy of defending and strengthening international peace, a policy of opposing the preparation and launching of new wars, and a policy of international cooperation and the development of transactional relations between all countries. Today, billions of people around the world know that the Soviet Union is their true friend and reliable defender, and a pillar of peace and independence for all peoples. They look upon this country, which is building communism, with ardent love. The editorial emphasizes that the reactionary forces of capitalist countries are desperately trying to worsen the international situation, sow hatred and suspicion among the peoples of all countries, and try to weaken the forces of peace. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people are tirelessly increasing their vigilance, strictly guarding against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace. No matter how the enemies disguise themselves, no matter what kind of cloaks they put on, they must be exposed. The unbreakable unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the people is the foundation of the Soviet Union's power and the source of its invincibility.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Further Improve the Welfare of the Working People of Czechoslovakia" by Jaromír Ďuranský, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; "The Struggle of the African People for Freedom and Independence" by Léon Feix, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party; and "Maintaining the Democratic Regime of Guatemala" by José Manuel Fortuny, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Guatemalan Labor Party.

Ďuranský's article points out: The measures taken by Czechoslovakia on June 1st, simultaneously with the currency reform, to abolish the rationing system for food and manufactured goods, reflect the results of the smooth development of the national economy during the eight years of the people's regime, especially since 1948. Through this measure, the welfare of the working people has been improved, and favorable conditions have been created for further improvement of the people's welfare. Due to the abolition of the rationing system, the unified state-owned retail prices are much lower than the previous free market prices. At the same time, due to the currency reform, wages have been raised accordingly, so that the real wages of workers and staff are more than a quarter higher than before the war on average. Various subsidies and aid funds have also been increased. The abolition of the rationing system also has many benefits for farmers. In order to ensure that the development of trade on the basis of unified prices will lead to a reduction of prices and an increase in the actual income of the people in the near future, it is necessary to ensure a comprehensive increase in the output of consumer goods, and it is necessary to ensure the completion of the agricultural production plan and the national procurement plan for grain. Now, the working people of enterprises, shops, institutions, and rural areas in Czechoslovakia are formulating socialist conventions and striving to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of production plans.

Feix's article first describes the miserable situation of more than 40 million Africans enslaved by French colonists, and describes their arduous struggle for freedom and independence. The article points out that the people of North Africa have already gained considerable political experience in the struggle. They now understand that the decisive role in the struggle for national liberation must be played by the working class in a fighting alliance with the broad masses of peasants. The French working class and its party, the Communist Party, are resolutely supporting the struggle of the colonial people of Africa.

Fortuny's article exposes the increasingly shameless interference of the American reactionaries in the internal affairs of Guatemala, and the various activities of conspiring to subvert the democratic regime of Guatemala. The article also points out the important task of the Guatemalan people to strengthen unity and resist the interference in internal affairs by imperialists and their running dogs.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    一九五三年第二十七期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十七期中文版已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“苏联——各国人民和平和安全的支柱”的社论。社论指出，苏联各族人民正以无限的信心和热情执行苏联共产党第十九次代表大会所制定的经济和文化建设的宏伟计划。苏联共产党是苏维埃社会的伟大的指导力量和领导力量，共产党的钢铁般的团结和磐石般的巩固，是它的力量和威力的基本先决条件，它的一切活动都是符合劳动人民的切身利益的。共产党制订的政策在几十年的斗争中经历了考验。苏联的外交政策，对于一切爱好和平的人民都是亲切的。它是保卫和加强国际和平的政策，是反对准备和发动新战争的政策，是国际合作和发展一切国家间的事务关系的政策。今天，世界各地的亿万人民都知道苏联是他们真正的朋友和可靠的保卫者，是各国人民和平和独立的支柱。他们以热烈的敬爱瞩望着这个正在建设共产主义的国家。社论强调说：资本主义国家的反动势力正在拚命使国际局势恶化，在各国人民间播种仇恨和猜疑，力图削弱和平的力量。苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民正在不倦地提高他们的警惕性，严防和平敌人的阴谋。无论敌人怎样掩盖自己，无论他们披上怎样的外衣，一定要把他们揭发出来。共产党、苏联政府和人民的牢不可破的团结，是苏联的威力的基础和不可战胜性的根源。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记处书记雅罗米尔·杜兰斯基的“进一步提高捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的福利”，法国共产党中央委员利昂·费克思的“非洲人民争取自由和独立”，危地马拉劳动党中央委员会总书记何塞·曼努埃尔·福特尼的“维护危地马拉的民主政权”。
    杜兰斯基的文章指出：捷克斯洛伐克六月一日与币制改革同时实行的取消食品和制成品配给制的措施，是人民政权八年期间，特别是一九四八年以来国民经济顺利发展的结果的反映。通过这种措施，提高了劳动人民的福利，并为人民福利的进一步增进创造了有利的条件。由于配给制的取消，统一规定的国营零售价格比以前自由市场上的价格减低很多，同时，由于币制改革，工资跟着提高了，这样就使工人和职员的实际工资比战前平均提高了四分之一以上。各种津贴和扶助金也都有了提高。取消配给制对农民也有许多好处。为了使贸易在统一价格的基础上的发展，在最近将来导向再度减低物价和提高人民的实际收入，必须保证全面增加消费品产量，必须保证完成农业生产计划和国家收购粮食的计划。现在，捷克斯洛伐克的各企业、商店、机关和农村的劳动人民，正在制订社会主义公约，为保证完成和超额完成生产计划而努力。
    费克思的文章首先叙述了四千多万非洲人在法国殖民者奴役下的悲惨境况，并叙述了他们为争取自由和独立而进行的艰苦斗争。文章指出：北非洲的人民在斗争中已经获得了相当丰富的政治经验。他们现在懂得，在争取民族解放的斗争中起决定作用的，必须是与广大农民结成战斗联盟的工人阶级。法国工人阶级及其政党——共产党正在坚决地支持非洲的殖民地人民的斗争。
    福特尼的文章揭露了美国反动派愈来愈无耻地干涉危地马拉的内政，阴谋颠覆危地马拉民主政权的种种活动。文章并指出了危地马拉人民加强团结抵抗帝国主义者及其走狗干涉内政的重要任务。
