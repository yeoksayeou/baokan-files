Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The construction work on the great Soviet Communist construction projects – the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station – continues to intensify. Construction workers are constantly achieving new successes in the enthusiastic socialist labor competition.

	The strong water-resistant weir at the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station construction site has successfully withstood the test of the spring flood. The spring flood of the Volga River has subsided. This year the river rose particularly high, but even at the peak of the flood, the construction workers in the foundation pit and installation site did not stop working. On the right bank of the Volga River, excavators in the power plant foundation pit had already dug several meters lower than the riverbed by mid-June. The excavation work is currently being intensified. Here, the construction of a massive hydropower station building will begin this year. One million cubic meters of concrete will be poured. Several cranes have already been installed on the site. A trestle for transporting concrete is being built in the foundation pit. Next to the foundation pit, an automated factory capable of producing 4,000 cubic meters of concrete per day has been completed. A new quarry near Yablonovy Mountain has also started operation. On the left bank of the Volga River, 100,000 cubic meters of concrete have been laid at the navigation lock construction site. Giant dredgers are carrying out excavation work on the navigation canal between the reservoir and the lock gate. Dozens of pylons for the cableway across the Volga River have been erected. The socialist competition on the construction site is in full swing. Mechanical operators are striving to complete the eight-month plan before August 21, the third anniversary of the government's decision to build the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station. In June, the excavation work in the power plant foundation pit reached a level of 15,000 cubic meters per day. The team of V. Miyachev, which initiated the movement to reduce the cost per cubic meter, has saved the state 40,000 rubles in the last four months. Automatic unloading truck driver Fadeyev and others made 30 trips per shift, exceeding the quota by more than double. The excavator team led by Ignatiev, an advanced worker at the quarry site, completed two-thirds of the entire month's plan in the first ten days of June. Concrete workers at the navigation lock construction site on the left bank have also made a guarantee to overfulfill the annual plan. The designed production capacity of the concrete factory has already been exceeded. The factory was originally planned to produce 2,000 cubic meters of concrete per day, but now it can produce 2,238 cubic meters per day.

	At the Stalingrad Hydropower Station construction site, the concrete work on the power plant foundation pit on Sand Island will begin soon. The work of dredgers in scouring the dam foundation between the hydropower station and the spillway dam foundation has been completed. Currently, hundreds of pumps are being used to remove the accumulated water in order to use dredgers to excavate the mud. By the 22nd, three million cubic meters of accumulated water had been drained from the foundation pit. It is expected that the pumping work will be completed in the first half of July, and the excavation work will begin on August 1. At the spillway dam foundation pit, dredgers are continuing to excavate mud. Preparations for pouring concrete are being accelerated. An automated factory capable of producing more than 8,000 cubic meters of concrete per day is being built on Green Island. The construction of a high-efficiency steel bar factory and many other enterprises has also begun. The construction of the pylons for the 450-meter-long cableway across the Volga River is about to begin. Through this cableway, about 15 million tons of various types of goods will be transported from the right bank of the Volga River to the concrete factory on Green Island. Currently, the scale of the socialist competition to further improve machine efficiency and reduce earthwork costs is expanding throughout the entire construction site. Excavator, shovel, bulldozer operators and automatic unloading truck drivers have all participated in the competition. Famous driver Rozhnov completes nearly three quotas every day, and advanced shovel operator Arutyunyan regularly completes two and a half quotas. Excavator operator Grischenko also completes almost two quotas every day. The efficiency of the water pumps has also been improved. According to the quota, the pumping capacity of each pump is 3,000 cubic meters per hour, but the pump operators pump 3,500 cubic meters per hour. The increase in machine production efficiency has greatly accelerated the progress of the project.

    苏联古比雪夫和斯大林格勒两水电站
    建设工程的进展速度很快
    【新华社讯】莫斯科消息：苏联伟大共产主义建设工程——古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站的建设工作，继续加紧进行。建筑工作者在热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛中不断获得新成就。
    古比雪夫水电站建筑工地上的强固拒水堰，已胜利地通过了春汛的考验。伏尔加河的春汛已经平静下去了。今年河水涨得特别高，可是，甚至在洪水涨到最高峰的时候，基坑和安装工地的建筑工人也没有停止过工作。在伏尔加河右岸，电力厂基坑的挖掘机六月中旬已经挖得比河底还低好几公尺。目前挖掘工作正在继续加紧进行。这里，今年将开始建造规模巨大的水电站建筑物。单混凝土就要浇灌一百万公方。现在工地上已安装好了几架起重机。基坑中正在建造运送混凝土的栈桥。基坑旁边，一座每昼夜可生产四千公方混凝土的自动化工厂已经建筑完成。雅布洛诺山附近一个新采石场也已开工。在伏尔加河左岸，通航水闸工地上已经敷设了十万公方混凝土。巨型吸泥机正在水库和闸门之间的通航运河工地上进行挖掘工作。横跨伏尔加河的铁索道的几十根支柱已竖立起来。工地上的社会主义竞赛正如火如荼地进行。机械操使者们都争取在八月二十一日政府颁布建设古比雪夫水电站决定三周年以前完成八个月的计划。六月间电力厂基坑挖土工作已达到每昼夜挖出一万五千土方的水平。发起争取降低每一土方费用的运动的维·米亚切夫工作队，最近四个月中已为国家节约了四万卢布。自动卸货卡车司机法捷耶夫等每班时间行车三十次，超过了定额一倍多。采石场工地上的先进工人伊格纳捷夫领导的挖掘机工作队六月上旬就完成了全月计划三分之二。左岸通航水闸工地上的混凝土工人也已提出超额完成一年计划的保证。混凝土工厂的预定生产能力已经超过了。该工厂预定是每昼夜生产两千公方混凝土。但现在该厂一昼夜已能生产二千二百三十八公方了。
    在斯大林格勒水电站工地，沙岛上电力厂基坑的混凝土工程不久就要开始了。吸泥机在水电站和溢洪道大堤基坑间冲积堤坝的工作已经完成。目前正在用几百台抽水机排除积水，以便使用挖泥机挖掘泥土。到二十二日，基坑中已排出了三百万公方积水。预计抽水工作将在七月上半月结束，挖掘工作将在八月一日开始。在溢洪道大堤基坑，吸泥机正在继续挖泥工作。浇灌混凝土的准备工作正在加速进行。绿岛工地上正在建设一个每日生产八千多公方混凝土的自动工厂。效能强大的钢筋工厂和许多其他企业的建设工作也已开始。横跨伏尔加河的四百五十公尺长的索道的支柱即将开始建筑。通过这条索道，将有一千五百万吨左右各式各样的货物从伏尔加河右岸运到绿岛上的混凝土工厂去。目前整个工程工地上，争取进一步提高机器效率、减低土工成本的社会主义竞赛的规模，正在扩大。掘土机、铲土机、推土机操使者和自动卸货卡车司机都参加了竞赛。著名司机罗日诺夫每天将近完成三个定额，先进铲土机操使者阿鲁纠尼安经常完成两个半定额。掘土机操使者格里申科也差不多每天完成两个定额。抽水机的效率也提高了，按照定额，抽水机每小时抽水量为三千公方，但抽水机操使者却每小时抽水三千五百公方。机器生产效率的提高大大加快了工程进展的速度。
