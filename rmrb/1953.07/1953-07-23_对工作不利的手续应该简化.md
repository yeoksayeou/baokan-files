    Procedures Detrimental to Work Should Be Simplified
    Readers Xiong Zixun and Jiang Guoying wrote: Boatmen transporting goods on the Han River all say: "The people's government's door is easy to enter, but some things are difficult to handle; although handling procedures doesn't cost money, sometimes you have to run your legs off." A boatman opening a boat has to go through the following procedures: First, register with the Joint Transport Cooperative. Second, connect with the shipping company. Third, have the insurance company verify the license. Fourth, hire stevedores. Fifth, call a barge to lighter the goods. Sixth, unload the goods at the shipping company again, weigh them, stamp the waybill, check the numbers with the handler, and ask the insurance section chief to stamp it. Seventh, go to the Joint Transport Cooperative to issue a freight receipt. Eighth, go to the shipping company again to find the handler and manager to stamp it, have the business accountant review and issue an expenditure voucher, find the accountant to record it and ask the cashier to issue a transfer check, ask the stamp supervisor to stamp the check, and then ask the accounting section chief to review and stamp it. Ninth, go to the Joint Transport Cooperative to find the accountant to record it, exchange the cash check and stamp it. Tenth, go to the bank to have the business accountant verify the seal number, the supervisor review it, and go to the cashier to withdraw cash. Eleventh, go to the Joint Transport Cooperative to pay management fees, labor insurance welfare funds, and industrial and commercial taxes. Twelfth, find the shipping company again to set the contract. Thirteenth, go to the trade union to pay cultural and educational fees. Fourteenth, go to the shipping party to get the goods document introduction letter. Fifteenth, go to the tax bureau to stamp the export inspection seal. Sixteenth, go to the insurance company again to handle insurance procedures, have the clerk write the insurance policy, have the accountant review and issue a receipt, go to the cashier to pay the insurance premium, and go to the inspector to get the navigation license. Seventeenth, go to the water police station to handle export procedures. Eighteenth, find the tax bureau to inspect the goods and release them. If calculated in detail, this requires going through seven agencies, making eighteen trips back and forth, and handling thirty-odd procedures. Without completing these procedures, the boat cannot be released.
    Obviously, many of the above complicated procedures can be merged or simplified. However, the relevant units not only do not try to simplify them, but some staff members even deliberately make things difficult for the boatmen. For example, boatman Zeng Anmin once went to the shipping company to handle procedures and it took him three days to complete them. On the first day, the insurance section chief was off work. When the boatman went to find him, he said: "This is our system, we don't do business after work." The next day, Zeng Anshan waited until the shipping company went to work before going again. The insurance section chief said that he was busy with work and told him to "wait a moment"; when it was time for lunch, the section chief said again: "I've been busy all day, I want to go out for a stroll before handling it." As a result, Zeng Anshan waited until 7 p.m. to complete the first procedure. Because the manager was not at home at that time, he went to the shipping company again on the third day to ask the manager to stamp it. Some foreign boatmen do not know the addresses of these seven agencies, nor do they know the staff members. Opening a boat takes at least seven days to half a month to complete the procedures.
        "Procedures" and "systems" are established to ensure the smooth progress of work. The above-mentioned complicated and unreasonable procedures handled by various agencies for boatmen transporting goods on the Han River have greatly increased the trouble for the boatmen and affected the transportation time. It is really necessary to simplify them.

    对工作不利的手续应该简化
    读者熊子勋、江国瑛来信：在汉江运货的船民都这样说：“人民政府的门好进，可是有的事难办；办手续虽然不要钱，有时却要跑断腿。”船民开一只船要经过下面这些手续：第一、到联运社登记。第二、和托运公司接头。第三、到保险公司验照。第四、请搬运工人。第五、叫驳船驳货。第六、再到托运公司下货、过秤打码单、向经手人对数字和请保运股长盖章。第七、到联运社开运费收据。第八、再到托运公司找经手人和经理盖章，经业务会计复核后开支出传票，找会计记账和请出纳开转账支票，请监印的在支票上盖章，再请会计股长复核盖章。第九、到联运社找会计记账，换现金支票和盖章。第十、到银行由业务会计核对印鉴编号，主管人复核，到出纳取现金。第十一、到联运社交管理费、劳保福利金和工商税。第十二、再找托运公司定合约。第十三、到工会交文教费。第十四、到托运方拿货物单据介绍信。第十五、到税局盖出口查验印。第十六、再到保险公司办保险手续，由业务员写保单，经会计复核开收款收据，到出纳交保险费，到检验员那里拿航行证。第十七、到水上派出所办出口手续。第十八、找税局验货放行。如果详细计算起来，这就要经过七个机关，往返十八趟，办三十几道手续。没有办完这些手续，船就不能放行。
    显然，上述这些繁杂的手续，很多都是可以合并或简化的。可是有关单位不但不设法简化，有的工作人员甚至还故意留难船民。例如船民曾安民有一次去托运公司办手续，办了三天才办完。头一天保运股长下班了，船民去找他，他说：“这是我们的制度，下班不营业。”第二天曾安善等到托运公司上班时再去，保运股长说是工作正忙，叫他“等一等”；到吃下午饭时，股长又说：“忙了一天，要出去逛逛再办。”结果曾安善等到晚上七点才办好头一道手续，又因为那时经理不在家，到第三天又上托运公司请经理盖了章。有的外来船民不知道这七个机关的住址，也不认识工作人员，开一只船至少得办七天至半个月的手续。
        “手续”和“制度”是为保证工作顺利进行而订立的。上述各机关让汉江运货船民办的这些繁杂而不合理的手续已经大大增加了船民的麻烦，影响了运输的时间，实在有必要加以简化。
