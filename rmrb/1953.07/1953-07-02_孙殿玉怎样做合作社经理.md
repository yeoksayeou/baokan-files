The business of the Xia Zangma retail store of the Dingjia Dacun United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zangma County, Shandong Province, was becoming increasingly bleak. Daily turnover dropped from the original 600,000 yuan to 110,000 or 120,000 yuan. The items sold were mostly odds and ends like matches and oil. The retail store's business scope included Xia Zangma Villages 1, 2, and 3, as well as Zhong and Shang Zangma villages, a total of five villages. However, if the members of these villages wanted to buy things, they almost all passed by the store to buy from the Longtanzi and Dacun retail stores. This serious situation caused unease among the cadres, and all three cadres were in low spirits.

In order to reverse the serious situation of the retail store, the leading cadres of the Dingjia Dacun United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative appointed Sun Dianyu (a Communist Party member), a salesman of the cooperative, as the manager of the store in February of this year. When Comrade Sun Dianyu arrived at the store and saw the bleak business and the low morale of the cadres, he had a fierce ideological struggle. He thought: "If the masses don't come to the door, things can't be sold, and even eating will be a problem. What can be done?" But then he thought: "The leadership sent me here to reverse this situation. Can a Communist Party member bow his head in the face of difficulties? No!" At this time, the county cooperative held a meeting of grassroots cooperative cadres. Through summarizing work, commending good people and deeds, criticizing and examining shortcomings, settling accounts with capitalist business ideology, and arranging for the supply of materials for spring production, Comrade Sun Dianyu, through the education of this meeting and the help of the leadership, established a firm determination to overcome difficulties, reverse the situation, and do a good job in supplying materials for spring.

After returning to the village, Sun Dianyu first took the initiative to contact the township and village cadres to seek their help, and went deep into the masses to understand the members' opinions of the cooperative retail store. According to various investigations, the main reasons why members did not buy things at the retail store were: the retail store cadres had a bad attitude, spoke of personal feelings, shortchanged on the liquor (short by one or two taels per catty), and used a large scale for intake and a small scale for output (short by three catties per hundred catties). Then he convened a cadre meeting, laid out the problems, and studied them with everyone. At the beginning, there were differences of opinion. Some cadres thought: "If we continue to do things this way, we won't lose money. Even if we make money, it's for the masses. What's wrong with that?" Some asked in reply: "Since it's for the masses, why do the masses object? If the masses don't come to the door, things can't be sold, and the backlog of funds can't be turned over, so business can't be done! Other cooperative stores are selfless, and their scales and measures meet the standards. Not only have they not lost money, but they have also expanded their business scope. What's the reason for this?" As the discussion deepened, opinions gradually converged. Through comparison and analysis, the cadres realized from reality the harm of the one-sided profit-seeking viewpoint and further felt the necessity of overcoming capitalist business ideology and work style. The cadres' awareness was raised, and they were determined to improve their work. Later, various township meetings and member meetings within the scope of the retail store were held, and the retail store cadres made deep self-criticisms to the masses, expressed their determination to improve, and immediately replaced the old scales and measures with new ones on the spot. The members of the community immediately responded: "This time, the cooperative is really going to get better." Some people also said: "If the cooperative could have been like this earlier, who would have been willing to go so far to buy things?"

Since then, the retail store's business has undergone a fundamental improvement. More and more people came to buy things, the turnover increased day by day, the cadres' morale also rose, and the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer. At this time, Comrade Sun Dianyu also felt that it was not enough to just sit in the store and supply the masses with means of production and livelihood materials to help the masses improve production. In order to solve this problem, he led the cadres to go deep into the Xia Wenchang mutual aid team in Xia Zangma Village 1 to help the team draw up a production plan, study the use of surplus labor, operate side businesses, and solve the problem of disaster relief within the team. This improved the team members' enthusiasm for production, and they ordered one waterwheel, one seven-step plow, and one sprayer. After the step plow arrived, Sun Dianyu first tested it in the group, taught all the group members, and then had them publicize it to the masses. In this way, twelve step plows were quickly promoted throughout the township, and one "hanging plow" that had not been used last year was also put into use. Old man Ding Peiwen, who had not welcomed the step plow in the past, said after trying the step plow: "I didn't believe it could be so easy to use. It's true that the cooperative's cadres have changed, and things have changed with them." In the work of promoting chemical fertilizers, Sun Dianyu first summarized the experience of Wang Yongzuo, Wang Yongwan, and others who had used chemical fertilizers last year and harvested more wheat, publicized it, and made three guarantees to the masses: "Guarantee effectiveness, guarantee no harm to crops, and guarantee teaching the techniques." Then he conducted an experiment in the Xia Wenchang group. After typical introductions and experiments, the masses' concerns were dispelled, and 1,611 catties were sold throughout the township. The wheat that was top-dressed with chemical fertilizer grew very strongly. The masses reflected that it was a good thing. At the same time, according to the needs of the masses, he also promoted 250 catties of Yanda 81 millet seeds, 78 catties of Golden Queen corn seeds, 650 shovels, and more than 30 spades throughout the township.

Due to the lead of Comrade Sun Dianyu and the joint efforts of the retail store cadres, in the entire spring plowing production, they earnestly changed their work style and implemented the business policy of serving agricultural production wholeheartedly, thus improving the relationship between the cooperative and the masses, establishing the prestige of the cooperative, and gradually revitalizing the cooperative retail store that was about to collapse. Now, the daily turnover of the retail store has gradually increased from the original 110,000 or 120,000 yuan to more than 1 million yuan.

    孙殿玉怎样做合作社经理
    陈绍亭、刘中奎、刘承善
    山东省藏马县第四区丁家大村联村供销合作社下藏马零售店的营业，一天天地萧条下来。每天的营业额由原来的六十万元下降到十一、二万元。出售的东西都是火柴、油等零星物品。零售店的营业范围，包括下藏马一、二、三村和中、上藏马等五个村。可是这些村的社员要买东西，差不多都穿过该店到龙潭子、大村零售店去买。这一严重情况，引起了干部情绪的不安，三个干部的情绪都很不好。
    丁家大村联村供销合作社的领导干部为了扭转该零售店的严重局面，于今年二月间提任丁家大村联村供销合作社营业员孙殿玉（共产党员）到该店当经理。孙殿玉同志到了店里，看到营业萧条和干部情绪低落的情况，思想上发生了激烈的斗争。他想到：“群众不上门，东西卖不了，吃饭也成问题，这怎么有办法呢！”但又想：“为了扭转这个局面，上级才派我来。难道共产党员能在困难面前低头吗？不能！”正在这个时候，县社召开了基层社干部会议。通过总结工作，表扬好人好事和批评检查缺点，清算了资本主义的经营思想，布置了春季生产的物资供应工作。经过这次会议的教育和领导方面的帮助，孙殿玉同志树立了坚定的克服困难、扭转局面、搞好春季物资供应工作的决心。
    孙殿玉回村后，首先主动地联系乡、村干部，争取他们的帮助，深入群众了解社员对合作社零售店的意见。根据多方面的调查，找到了社员不到零售店买东西的主要原因：零售店干部态度不好，讲私人感情，酒提不够（每斤差一两），大秤入小秤出
    （每百斤差三斤）。然后他召开了干部会，摆开问题，和大家一起进行研究。开始时意见有分歧。有的干部认为：“照现在这样办，买卖赔不了；就是赚了钱，也是群众的，还有什么不对呢？”有的就反问说：“既然是为了群众，为什么群众还要反对呢？群众不上门，东西卖不了，积压资金不能周转，买卖就会做不成！别的合作社商店，大公无私，秤、提合乎标准，不仅没赔本，还扩大了营业范围，这是什么道理呢？”讨论逐步深入，意见也渐趋一致。经过对比、分析，干部们从实际中体会到片面营利观点的危害，进一步感觉到克服资本主义经营思想和作风的必要。干部的觉悟提高了，都下定决心改进工作。后来召开乡的各种会议和零售店所辖范围内的社员大会，由零售店干部向群众作了深刻的检讨，表示了改进的决心，并当场换上新秤、新提。社员群众立即反应：“合作社这次真是要变好了。”还有的人说：“社里如果早能这个样，谁还愿意跑远路买东西呢？”
    此后，零售店的业务便有了根本的好转。买东西的人日渐多了，营业额逐日增加，干部的情绪也高涨了，干部和群众的关系也密切了。这时孙殿玉同志又感到光坐在屋里供应群众生产资料和生活资料，是不能帮助群众搞好生产的。为了解决这一问题，他就领导干部深入下藏马一村夏文昌互助组，帮助该组打生产谱，研究使用剩余劳力，经营副业，解决组内的灾荒的问题，这就提高了组员的生产积极性，订购了水车、七步犁、喷雾器各一部。步犁来了后，孙殿玉首先在该组作了试验，教会了全体组员，然后再由他们向群众宣传。这样全乡很快就推广了步犁十二部，并把去年未发挥作用的一部“挂犁”也使用起来了。过去不欢迎步犁的丁培文老大爷试验了步犁以后说：“我没信能这样好使。真是合作社的干部变了样，东西也跟着变了样。”在推广化学肥料工作中，孙殿玉先总结了王永左、王永万等去年使用化学肥料多收了小麦的经验，进行了宣传，并向群众提出了三条保证：“保证有效，保证对庄稼无害，保证教会技术”。接着又在夏文昌组作了试验。经过典型介绍、试验后，解除了群众顾虑，全乡推销一千六百一十一斤。凡是追施化学肥料的小麦长的都很健旺。群众纷纷反映是好东西。同时，他还根据群众的要求，在全乡推广了燕大八一谷种二百五十斤、金皇后玉米种七十八斤、铲六百五十个、锨三十多张。
    由于孙殿玉同志的带头和零售店干部的共同努力，在整个春耕生产中，他们切实地转变了作风，贯彻了全心全意为农业生产服务的经营方针，因而改善了合作社与群众的关系，树立了合作社的威信，使将要垮台的合作社零售店逐渐活跃起来。现在该零售店每天的营业额已由原来的十一、二万元，逐步提高到一百多万元。
