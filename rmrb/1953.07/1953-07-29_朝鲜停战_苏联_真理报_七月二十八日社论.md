    Korean Armistice
    --Editorial from the Soviet "Pravda" July 28th

    The long-term negotiations have been victoriously completed, and the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed at Panmunjom on July 27th. Military actions have ceased. The sound of cannons that has lasted for more than three years has subsided. The armed forces of the belligerent parties are withdrawing from the demarcation line along the entire front, leaving a demilitarized zone. Preparations are now beginning for a political conference, the mission of which is to ensure a final solution to the Korean issue.

    The telegram from Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to Comrade Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, published today states:

    "The entire Soviet people are deeply satisfied with the news of the signing of the Armistice Agreement, and they believe that the victorious conclusion of the armistice negotiations is a great victory for the heroic Korean people and the valiant Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The Korean Armistice Agreement is also a great victory for the entire camp of peace and democracy.

    After the end of the war, the Korean people will face the task of restoring the national unity of Korea and rebuilding the national economy destroyed by the war imposed on the Korean people.

    The Soviet Government wishes the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea success in completing these great and urgent tasks, and expresses its willingness to do everything possible to help the long-suffering Korean people restore a peaceful life and heal the serious wounds caused by the bloody war for their freedom and independence."

    This telegram from the leader of the Soviet government reflects the feelings of all Soviet people, who celebrate the great victory of the heroic Korean people and the valiant Chinese People's Volunteers, and the great victory of the entire camp of peace and democracy.

    These feelings of all Soviet people were also expressed in the telegram from V.M. Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, to Li Dong-geon, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The people of the world view the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement as the practical result of the long-term struggle waged by all progressive mankind, who have consistently fought for peace with ever-increasing vigor. The victorious conclusion of the Korean armistice negotiations will inspire all peace-loving people to make new efforts in this great struggle.

    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly shows that the only correct and only possible way to resolve international disputes in the current international situation is through negotiations between the parties concerned, rather than through the notorious "policy of strength." This most important event confirms that the most complex international problems can be solved successfully through negotiations, as long as there is sincerity in resolving these problems.

    The planners and implementers of the "policy of strength" have learned from their own experience that it will not work to adopt this policy against those democratic countries whose people have become masters of their own destiny. The United States and its satellite countries, which launched elite troops against the Korean people, have not been able to crush the heroic resistance of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers who went to its aid, even after three years of the most brutal warfare.

    In a statement issued on the signing of the Armistice Agreement, US Secretary of State Dulles shamelessly boasted that millions of Korean civilians had been killed during the three years of military operations and that the territory of North Korea had "largely been reduced to ruins." Perhaps Dulles originally intended to scare someone with this statement, but the result was not like that; the US Secretary of State unintentionally pointed out the true face of American intervention, which was mainly to massacre the peaceful residents of Korea and destroy the people's wealth.

    The outcome of the military operations in Korea clearly shows that this method of warfare is not helping the US Command. Even the American generals had to admit that they were powerless to achieve a military victory in Korea. Former Secretary of Defense Marshall (who no one would suspect of sympathizing with Korea) once said of this war: "The myth has been shattered; we are not as powerful a country as people imagined."

    The key lies in the fact that, recognizing that their struggle was just, the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers who went to help them gained invincible strength and incomparable fortitude. The indisputable superiority of the people's democratic system, and the unshakable unity between the front and the rear, created conditions that enabled the Korean people, closely united around the Workers' Party and their government, to overcome all the difficulties of the war. Thousands of heroes emerged from the Korean People's Army, inspired by a great spirit of patriotism, and their feats will be immortalized. As for the invaders, the morale of their troops was low, because the American soldiers recognized that the cause for which they were forced to give their lives was unjust.

    That is why they could not achieve any military success even after deploying the most elite divisions of the US Army with experience in the Second World War, as well as many air force units and fleets, to the Korean battlefield. After three years of war, they remained where they launched the aggression--on the 38th parallel.

    The American aggression against the peace-loving Korean people aroused unanimous protests around the world. A powerful movement against the interventionists has unfolded in all countries.

    All of this thwarted the plans of the US ruling clique, forcing them to agree to armistice negotiations.

    Everyone remembers the lengthy and complex process of these negotiations. Since the beginning of the Korean War, all peace-loving forces in the world have advocated an immediate ceasefire and negotiations to peacefully resolve the Korean conflict.

    The Soviet Union has consistently supported all steps aimed at ending the war. As early as July 1950, the Soviet government's reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru marked the beginning of such steps. Subsequently, in June 1951, the Soviet representative to the United Nations laid the groundwork for the start of armistice negotiations in a radio address in New York. Finally, on April 1, 1953, the Soviet government firmly supported the major initiative of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which aimed to break the deadlock created by the American side on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, thereby guaranteeing an early signing of the Armistice Agreement.

    The proposals put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides and supported by the Soviet Union created conditions for a just resolution of the Korean issue, making it possible to sign an armistice agreement and cease hostilities.

    What caused the Korean negotiations to drag on for two years and seventeen days? The only reason was that certain groups in the United States, obsessed with maintaining and expanding the hotbed of war in the Far East, tried every means to delay the signing of the Armistice Agreement and to complicate it, if not ultimately to sabotage it. The failure of these conspiracies proves that the people's efforts to strive for peace have developed into such a powerful force that all open and hidden enemies of peace have had to give way. Therefore, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the forces of peace.

    A lasting peace is to be established in Korea. However, lasting peace can only be established when the Korean people are given the opportunity to decide their own destiny without foreign interference. The restoration of national unity in Korea, which even before the outbreak of the war was the main issue facing the Korean people, will play a decisive role in this regard.

    The reunification of Korea in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles is a matter of the utmost importance to the Korean people themselves.

    The people of all countries will closely watch the future development of events in Korea. They are extremely concerned that the aggressive forces should not undermine the Armistice Agreement signed on July 27th. Therefore, broad public opinion is vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the enemies of peace who are trying to obstruct a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

    There are many people in the United States who talk as if Syngman Rhee might one day
    "arbitrarily" violate the armistice. Everyone is clear that talk about this puppet cannot absolve the United States of its responsibility to abide by the agreement it signed. Needless to say, the US military command and the US government have a responsibility to fulfill the Armistice Agreement they signed.

    The Korean armistice opens the way for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. Now that the sound of cannons has ceased, the Korean people face the task of restoring national unity in Korea, rebuilding the cities and villages destroyed by the war, and restoring the national economy. In all of this, the Korean people will certainly receive the active support and assistance of the Soviet Union and other democratic countries.

    The victorious completion of the Korean armistice negotiations convincingly proves that there is no international dispute that cannot be resolved through negotiations and consultations between the parties concerned. The recognition of this fact gives new strength to peace-loving people in their struggle to consolidate world peace.

    朝鲜停战
    ——苏联“真理报”七月二十八日社论
    长期的谈判胜利完成了，朝鲜停战协定已于七月二十七日在板门店签字了。军事行动停止了。响了三年多的炮声平息下来了。交战双方的武装力量在整个战线上撤离分界线，留出了非军事区。现在开始准备政治会议，这个会议的使命是要保证朝鲜问题的最后解决。
    今天发表的苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫同志给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成同志的电报中说：
    “签订停战协定的消息使全体苏联人民都深感满意，他们认为，停战谈判的胜利结束是英雄的朝鲜人民和英勇的中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利。
    朝鲜停战协定同时也是整个和平民主阵营的伟大胜利。
    战争结束后，朝鲜人民就面临着恢复朝鲜的国家统一的任务，面临着把强加于朝鲜人民的战争所摧毁的国民经济加以重建的任务。
    苏联政府祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在完成这些伟大而迫切的任务时获得胜利，并表示愿意尽一切可能，帮助长期遭受苦难的朝鲜人民恢复和平生活，医治因争取他们国家的自由和独立的流血战争而造成的严重创伤。”
    苏联政府领袖的这封电报反映了全体苏联人的感情，他们庆贺英雄的朝鲜人民和英勇的中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利，庆贺整个和平民主阵营的巨大胜利。
    全体苏联人的这种感情也在苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫同志致朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省李东建同志的电报中表现了出来。
    全世界人民都把朝鲜停战协定的签订，看成是全体进步人类长期坚持斗争的实际结果，他们一贯以日益充沛的精力为争取和平而斗争。朝鲜停战谈判的胜利结束，将鼓舞一切爱好和平的人民，使他们在这一伟大的斗争中作新的努力。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订，清楚地表明：在目前的国际形势下，解决国际争端的唯一正确的和唯一可能的途径，是有关各方进行谈判，而不是采用臭名昭著的“实力政策”。这一最重要的事件证实，通过谈判是可以胜利地解决最复杂的国际问题的，只要在谈判中有解决这些问题的诚意。
    “实力政策”的策划者和推行者，已经从他们自己的经验中认识到了：要对那些人民作了自己命运的主人的民主国家采取这种政策，是不会得到结果的。发动了精锐部队来反对朝鲜人民的美国及其仆从国家，在进行最惨酷的战争的三年中，也没有能够粉碎朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及前往援助它的中国人民志愿军的英勇抵抗。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在就停战协定签字而发表的声明中，竟厚颜无耻地夸耀说，在三年来的军事行动过程中朝鲜平民有数百万人被打死了，北朝鲜的领土“大都沦为废墟了”。也许杜勒斯原想以这种声明吓唬什么人，然而结果却不是那么样；美国国务卿无意之间指出了美国干涉的真面目，原来主要是要屠杀朝鲜的和平居民和毁灭人民的财富。
    朝鲜的军事行动的结局清楚地说明，这种战争方法是帮助不了美国司令部的。甚至美国的将军们，也不得不承认，他们无力在朝鲜取得军事胜利。前国防部长马歇尔（谁也绝不会怀疑他同情朝鲜吧）有一次谈到这个战争时说道：“神话已经破灭了，我们原来并非像人家所想像那样的一个强国。”
    关键在于：由于认识到自己斗争是正义的，朝鲜人民和前往帮助他们的中国人民志愿军就获得了不可战胜的力量和无可比拟的坚强精神。人民民主制度的无可争辩的优越性，前方和后方不可动摇的团结，创造出了条件，使得紧密团结在劳动党和自己政府周围的朝鲜人民克服了战争的一切困难。为伟大的爱国主义精神所鼓舞的朝鲜人民军中间涌现出了数以千计的英雄，他们的功绩是永垂不朽的。至于侵略者，他们军队的士气是低沉的，因为美国士兵认识到他们被迫去为之送命的事业是不义的。
    这就是为什么他们即使把具有第二次世界大战经验的美军最精锐的师团以及许多空军部队和舰队投入朝鲜战场，仍然不能获得任何军事成就。三年战争的结果，他们还是停留在他们发动侵略的地方——三八线上。
    美国对爱好和平的朝鲜人民的侵略，引起了全世界的一致抗议。在所有的国家里都展开了反对干涉者的强大运动。
    所有这一切使得美国统治集团的打算失败了，迫使他们同意进行停战谈判。
    这个拖延很久的、复杂的谈判过程是大家都记得的。全世界爱好和平的力量，从朝鲜战争一开始，就主张立刻停火，和进行谈判以和平解决朝鲜冲突。
    苏联坚持不渝地支持一切旨在结束战争的步骤。早在一九五○年七月，苏联政府给印度总理尼赫鲁的答复就是这种步骤的开端。随后，苏联驻联合国代表于一九五一年六月在纽约发表广播演说时，为开始停战谈判打下了基础。最后，在一九五三年四月一日，苏联政府坚决地支持了中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的重大倡议，这一倡议的目的是要打破美国方面在交换战俘问题上造成的僵局，从而保证早日签订停战协定。
    朝中方面提出的并为苏联所支持的建议，为公正解决朝鲜问题创造了条件，使得有可能签订停战协定，停止敌对行为。
    朝鲜谈判拖延了两年零十七天之久，原因在哪里呢？唯一的原因是：美国的某些集团，醉心于在远东保持并扩大战争的温床，千方百计地拖延停战协定的签订，并使它复杂化，如果不是最后破坏它的话。这些阴谋的失败，证明人民的争取和平的努力已经发展成为这样强大的力量，使得一切公开的和隐蔽的和平敌人不得不让步。因此，朝鲜停战协定的签订是和平力量的巨大胜利。
    持久的和平将要在朝鲜建立，然而，只有当朝鲜人民在不受外国干涉的条件下，得到了由自己来解决本国命运的机会时，持久的和平才能建立。在这方面起决定性作用的将是恢复朝鲜全国统一的问题，这个问题甚至在战争爆发以前，就是朝鲜人民所面临的一切问题中的主要问题。
    按照和平、民主的原则统一朝鲜，是朝鲜人民自己的切身相关的事情。
    各国人民都将密切地注视朝鲜事件今后的发展。他们所极端关心的事情，就是不要让侵略力量破坏七月二十七日签订的停战协定。因此广泛的舆论界都警惕地注视着那些企图阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的和平的敌人的阴谋。
    在美国有许多人谈论着，似乎李承晚会有朝一日
    “任意”破坏停战。每一个人都清楚，关于这个傀儡的这种说法，绝不能使美国推脱掉它对于遵守它所签订的协定应负的责任。不用说，美国的军事司令部和美国政府有责任履行它签了字的停战协定。
    朝鲜停战为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了途径。现在，当炮声停止了的时候，朝鲜人民面临的任务是恢复朝鲜的全国统一，重建被战争破坏了的城市和乡村，恢复本国的国民经济。在这一切方面朝鲜人民一定可以得到苏联和其他民主国家的积极支持和帮助。
    朝鲜停战谈判的胜利完成，令人信服地证明：没有什么国际争端，不可以通过谈判，通过有关方面的协商来获得解决。对这一点的认识，使得爱好和平的人民在为巩固世界和平而进行的斗争中获得了新的力量。
