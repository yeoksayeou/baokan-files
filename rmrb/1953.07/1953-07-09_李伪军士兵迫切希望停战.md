Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 8th: The actions of the Li Seung-man (Syngman Rhee) gang to sabotage the ceasefire are being increasingly opposed by ROK army soldiers. Among the ROK army soldiers who long for a ceasefire, there is a saying: "Whoever opposes the ceasefire, let him go fight himself!"

The news about Li Seung-man sabotaging the ceasefire is being strictly blocked from the ROK army soldiers. Soldiers who discuss the ceasefire negotiations are beaten by ROK army officers or put in confinement. According to ROK army soldiers captured by our army, five out of twenty-nine people in one squad were severely beaten for this reason.

But the ROK army soldiers don't care about this. From newly captured recruits and comrades returning from the rear, from the broadcasts of the Korean-Chinese army on the forward positions, or from overhearing the casual conversations of officers, they inquire about the news of Li Seung-man sabotaging the ceasefire, and spread their opinions against Li Seung-man to each other. One day, a squad leader (equivalent to a deputy squad leader) of the ROK army's 8th Division went to the division's military store to buy things, heard the news of Li Seung-man opposing the ceasefire, and told several other squad leaders in the same squad, angrily saying: "This old guy doesn't care about our life and death, he should be called to live on the front line mountain for a few days and taste the flavor!" All three squad leaders said: Those guys who oppose the ceasefire should be killed! A squad leader surnamed Zheng said: "If I have a chance to go to the rear, I will definitely bring a few grenades and kill those police special agents who force the people to participate in the 'anti-ceasefire' parade!" A communication soldier also chimed in and said: "We should turn our guns and beat these bastards, and see if they will stop the ceasefire or not?" In the 4th Company of the 16th Regiment of the ROK army, some people heard Li's radio broadcast "The ceasefire cannot be achieved until the Taegeukgi (ROK army's "national flag") is inserted on the banks of the Yalu River and the Tumen River", and they cursed: "Let them insert it themselves!" In the 60th Regiment of the 20th Division of the ROK army, a lieutenant company commander (equivalent to a company commander) also said privately: "My greatest hope is for a ceasefire, to go home, I have a newly married wife, she is worried about me. Whoever opposes the ceasefire, let him go fight himself!"

According to ROK army prisoners, the source of soldiers in South Korea is now nearly exhausted. In the ROK army, many soldiers are hunchbacked old farmers, weak college students, middle school teachers, elementary school principals, restaurant owners, etc. They were all tied up by Li Seung-man's police special agents not long ago, and rushed to the front line as cannon fodder without any combat training. These people in the ROK army can only eat three cold rice balls every day, and the number of sick people is increasing every day. Some people are so hungry that they go to find wild vegetables to fill their stomachs, which leads to some people being poisoned to death. Captured ROK army soldiers said: We really don't want to fight anymore! If Li Seung-man wants to fight, let him go fight himself.

### 李伪军士兵迫切希望停战

    李伪军士兵迫切希望停战
    【新华社朝鲜前线八日电】李承晚匪帮破坏停战的行动，愈来愈厉害地受到李伪军士兵的反对。在渴望停战的李伪军士兵中流行着这样一句话：“谁反对停战，就让他自己去打！”
    在李伪军士兵中，有关李承晚破坏停战的消息是被严密地封锁着的。士兵中谈论停战谈判的都要遭到李伪军军官的殴打或者被关禁闭。据被我军俘掳的李伪军士兵说，有一个小队的二十九个人中有五个人因此挨过毒打。
    但是李伪军士兵不管这些，他们从刚抓来的新兵和回过后方的同伴口中，从朝中军队在前沿阵地的广播中，或者从偷听军官的闲谈中，打听李承晚破坏停战的消息，并且互相传播发表他们反对李承晚的意见。有一天，李伪军第八师一个分队副（相当于副班长）到师部军人商店买东西，听到李承晚反对停战的消息，回来就告诉同一小队的另几个分队长，并愤愤地说：“这个老家伙不顾我们的死活，该叫他到第一线山头上来住几天，尝尝味道！”三个分队长都说：这些反对停战的家伙都该打死！一个姓郑的分队长说：“我要有机会到后方去，一定带上几个手榴弹，非把那些强迫老百姓参加‘反停战’游行的警察特务打死不可！”旁边一个通讯兵也插进来说：“该掉转枪来揍这些混蛋，看他们停战不停战？”在李伪军第十六联队的四中队，有些人听到李伪电台广播“太极旗（李伪匪帮“国旗”）未插到鸭绿江和图们江边以前，不能停战”，都痛骂道：“叫他们自己去插吧！”李伪军第二十师六十联队，有一个中尉中队长（相当于连长）也私下里说：“我最大的希望就是停战，回家，我有新婚的妻子，她挂念着我。谁反对停战，就叫他自己去打！”
    据李伪军俘虏说，现在南朝鲜的兵源已近枯竭，在李伪军中许多士兵是驼背的老农民、瘦弱的大学生、中学教员、小学校长、饭店老板等，他们都是不久以前被李承晚的警察特务用绳子绑来的，没受过甚么作战训练就赶上前线当炮灰了。这些人在李伪军中每天只能吃到三个冷饭团，生病的每天都在增加，有的人饿极了就去找野菜充饥，以致有的中毒身死。被俘的李伪军士兵都说：我们实在不愿意再打了！李承晚要打，就让他自己去打吧。
