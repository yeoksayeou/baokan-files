Achievements of the Party Organization of the 21st Engineering Company in Implementing the Suggestions of Soviet Experts
By our reporter Pei Lan

    In an office at a construction site, a young man, holding a thick stack of organized materials, asked Deputy Manager Wang Yuexuan (a Communist Party member) to approve them for printing and distribution. These were the advanced experiences proposed by Soviet experts during the installation of the No. 7 machine. Deputy Manager Wang took the materials and said to me, "In the short months that Soviet experts have been with our company, they have already provided us with 508 pieces of advanced experience. With the help of these experiences, we completed the great and complex installation project four days ahead of schedule, and the quality met Soviet design standards."

    Learned to Operate the Machine in Three Days
    Deputy Manager Wang then told me a vivid story.

    During the installation of the No. 7 machine, Soviet experts used three days to teach the workers how to operate the new Soviet centrifugal oil filter. In the installation work, a large transformer needed to be installed, requiring 200 tons of oil. At that time, the company had several old-fashioned paper-type oil filters, but these could only process 1,500 liters per hour and had to filter the oil forty times before it could be used. Later, several new Soviet centrifugal oil filters were shipped in, but no one knew how to operate them. Soviet expert Comrade Molchanov arrived. After learning about the situation, he said, "As long as there are machines, it doesn't matter if the workers don't know how to operate them. Find six workers, and I can teach them in three days." Sure enough, after three days, the six workers not only learned how to operate the machines but also how to disassemble, install, and repair them.

    Apprentice Wu Fengjun and probationary technician Li Yongcheng spoke about how Comrade Molchanov taught them the technology of the oil filter: Comrade Molchanov taught us so patiently. On the first day, he taught us how to disassemble and install the machine. He personally disassembled a part, explaining each one to us: what it is called, its performance, and its function. He disassembled each part, and then reassembled them. During the installation, he explained each part again. After Comrade Molchanov completed a cycle, he asked, "Who is brave and wants to try first!" At this time, the young man Feng Chengkui tried it once, following the expert's method. The expert said, "Good, another person try." Afterward, we each took turns trying. In this way, after a day, the centrifugal oil filter obediently listened to our commands. On the second day, Comrade Molchanov instructed us to scrub the machine and install the attachments. At this time, he explained it to us again. On the third day, Comrade Molchanov held our hands, teaching us how to operate the machine one by one. Really, on the third afternoon, we could start the machine ourselves.

    After the workers mastered the advanced Soviet centrifugal oil filter, the oil only needed to be filtered three times and could reach a withstand voltage of 60,000 volts. The old paper-type oil filter needed to be filtered forty times and could only reach a withstand voltage of 40,000 volts.

    The company's Party committee regarded the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions as a serious political task. The Party committee used this concrete and vivid fact to conduct a series of education sessions for all employees, pointing out that "Soviet science is the most advanced in the world," making the majority of employees more deeply realize that they must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union.

    Communist Party Members in Critical Moments
    On March 10th, the leading cadres of the 21st Engineering Company's Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League, along with all the employees of the installation team, spent this day and night in an extremely tense atmosphere. Within these twenty-four hours, under the guidance of Soviet experts, they had to complete a miracle never before seen in history—solving the wheel spoke-shaft problem, one of the keys to installing the No. 7 machine. According to the old method, installing the shaft into the wheel spokes would take a total of twenty-one days, which would take up one-third of the entire installation time. Soviet expert Comrade Orlov suggested using the advanced experience of heat-shrinking wheel spokes, heating the spokes to expand them before inserting them into the shaft, which would only take twenty-four hours to complete the task.

    This project was an important part of the entire installation project. Party Secretary Shen Xinhang, Deputy Party Secretary Han Aiying, Deputy Manager and Installation Commander Wang Yuexuan, and other leading cadres personally directed the operation on-site. They held mobilization meetings for Party members and Youth League members in advance. Party Secretary Shen Xinhang called on all Party and Youth League members to lead all employees to ensure the 100% implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions and to avoid any negligence. Because if even a small operation did not meet the requirements, it would cause irreparable losses.

    During the construction, Comrade Orlov first taught the workers to measure the outer diameter of the main shaft and the inner diameter of the wheel spokes, calculating the difference between the two. The head of the 01 construction site, Zhuang Yurong, and the responsible technician, Zhang Huaitao, made the measurements and then asked Comrade Orlov to check them before deciding to implement the heat-shrinking wheel spoke method. This unfamiliar but crucial project was assigned to three shifts of workers, including Communist Party members Yang Changzhen and Chen Bin. In critical moments, it was time to test each Party member. The three shifts of workers worked tirelessly for a day and a night. Comrade Orlov and the head of the expert group, Comrade Shakov, also did not leave the site.

    Twenty-three hours passed. Comrade Orlov guided Zhuang Yurong and others to measure the final expansion coefficient of the wheel spokes at a high temperature of 170 degrees. He said, "Okay!" At this time, hundreds of pairs of surprised eyes stared at Communist Party members Zhao Hongfu and Liu Xiangshan as they cautiously and carefully operated the crane, lifting the heavy wheel spokes and slowly moving them. At this time, the hearts of all the cadres and workers were pounding like they had a thousand-pound stone hanging from them. Everyone knew that if it was not fitted within half an hour, the entire machine would be damaged. … When the minute hand reached twenty-three minutes, the wheel spokes landed steadily and accurately on the main shaft. A storm of applause suddenly erupted throughout the venue, warmly congratulating the success of the Soviet expert's guidance. This was a tense and astonishing scene. Many people recalled this situation and said: We really don't know how we got through this day and night. Think about it, according to the advanced Soviet experience, it takes twenty-four hours; according to our past method, it takes twenty-one days. This was really too exciting for us. No wonder some young workers, with their thumbs up, said to those skeptical veteran masters: "How about it, masters, did you see it? Twenty-four hours.”

    Every Word of the Soviet Experts is Precious
    Only at this time did the old technician Han Shichang express his true feelings. He said: "In the past, I was always afraid that the plans proposed by the experts would not be realized, but now I am truly convinced. The advanced and scientific experience proposed by the Soviet experts is more effective than anything else, and every word of the experts is precious!" Communist Party members and workers further recognized the value of Soviet advanced experience and set off a wave of learning advanced experience. Under the leadership of the company's Party committee, the installation team's Party branch further pointed out that implementing Soviet experts' suggestions was one of the standards for assessing the political awareness of each Party and Youth League member, calling for earnestly learning Soviet advanced experience to improve technology by another step! The installation team's administration also stipulated a series of systems: establishing an expert suggestion registration book, organizing advanced experience research groups, and stipulating that Wednesdays and Fridays would be advanced experience study days. The installation team's Youth League branch and trade union also formulated covenants to ensure the progress of this study.

    Helping the Chinese people complete the installation task on time and ensuring the training of Chinese worker cadres are among the conditions for the mutual competition of Soviet experts. Chinese workers used all methods to respond to the great selfless assistance and earnest teachings of Soviet experts. The group led by Communist Party member Chen Bin and veteran technician Yao Dexin first established a technical research association, holding meetings after work every day to check the implementation of expert suggestions and exchange learning experiences. After the work of heat-shrinking wheel spokes, Chen Bin kept every word of the Soviet experts in his heart. He drew all the machines he had personally installed, marked the names and functions of the parts, and recorded various construction methods and their theories. Chen Bin said: "My education level is low, so I can't record everything completely. But I remember more in my heart than what is written in my notebook."

    In order to enable every employee to master a technology, the company's Party committee required all employees to "go from not understanding to understanding, from unskilled to skilled, from skilled to proficient, to acquire professional knowledge and master one skill." This call received a warm response from all employees, and each employee prepared a small notebook to record advanced experience. Communist Party member Bai Zhen, who had just come to the company from the countryside, was a young man who did not know a single character. Putting down the hoe and picking up the instrument, some people thought this was extremely difficult. However, he was not intimidated by the difficulties. He is now familiar with all the work he does, and he has learned the work of technical workers such as measuring centerlines, drilling holes, and threading. Whenever he thinks of the working spirit of Soviet experts, he feels restless and cannot sleep well. He often dreams that he can already draw drawings. He wakes up excitedly, turns on the light, and draws the drawings he understood in his dream until he can't draw them anymore. The next day, he worked at the site for a day and then went home to draw again. He drew every day like this, and now he has drawn all the machines he installed, and he drew them correctly. At first, he couldn't write, but now he has learned to recognize more than a thousand characters, can write the names of machines, and can also record some simple operating procedures and work logs. Here, we can see how great is the power generated by the intersection of the great internationalist spirit of Soviet experts and the soaring enthusiasm for learning of Chinese workers.

    Whether technicians can directly listen to experts' suggestions has a significant impact on accelerating project construction. The company's Party committee paid special attention to the learning issues of technicians. The Party committee improved their political awareness by organizing the study of documents, holding seminars, organizing reports by advanced figures, and holding photo exhibitions. After studying the documents, the technicians of the 03 construction site, the dispatching department, and the civil engineering site jointly wrote a letter to the Party branch, expressing their determination to learn from the Soviet Union and ensure good work. The Party committee adopted a patient education attitude towards individual veteran technicians with resistant thoughts. Technician Zheng Xianwen of the 02 construction site, when installing a certain machine, Soviet expert Sheminernin suggested making four wooden wedges of 135 mm, but he made four wooden wedges of 130 mm based on his narrow experience. As a result, it turned out that the four wooden wedges made by Zheng Xianwen were unusable. The installation team's Party branch promptly convened various meetings, and through this fact, criticized various incorrect ideas, commended the young technician Chen Hanmin who modestly learned advanced experience and implemented expert suggestions, and set up a learning example for technicians. This fact was very educational for everyone.

    Chinese Stakhanovites
    Under the guidance of Soviet experts and Soviet Stakhanovites, Chinese Stakhanovites also emerged at the 21st Engineering Company. In the downline coil project, young Communist Party member Zhao Guangrong created a miracle. In the past, Zhao Guangrong had never done this kind of work. However, he had a strong determination to learn technology. He carefully watched every movement of the experts. At first, he imitated slowly. Later, under the expert's personal guidance and encouragement, he let go and started working, starting with fifteen, seventeen, and then reaching twenty-one. But Zhao Guangrong was not satisfied, he wondered how he could do it faster and better. When it was his turn to work, he worked wholeheartedly. When it was his turn to rest, he watched how others worked, and then practiced with his bare hands. At the same time, he asked technician Chen Hanmin for advice. In this way, he finally found the operating rules and created a record of twenty-seven. When Comrade Mikhailov saw that his apprentice was doing better than the teacher, he jumped up with joy. Comrade Orlov specially told the company's leading cadres: "Comrade Mikhailov has been doing coiling work for more than twenty-seven years. He created the highest record in the Soviet Union and won the honor of Stakhanovite. Zhao Guangrong should be the Chinese Stakhanovite."

    In the 21st Engineering Company, production experts like Zhao Guangrong are not isolated cases. When the 02 construction site was installing a certain machine, it was necessary to flatten the protruding parts of the machine itself. At that time, using a pneumatic chisel and electric drill, a team of eight people could only chisel one, and the efficiency was very low. Communist Party member Li Changrong, based on advanced Soviet experience, created a manual lathe. With this lathe, a team of only four or five people could turn three, and the fastest could turn four, ensuring the early completion of the project. Soviet experts unanimously praised the intelligence and bravery of Chinese workers. However, Chinese workers understand that without the close guidance of Soviet experts and the resolute leadership of the Party organization in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, there would be no these achievements.

    二十一工程公司党组织贯彻苏联专家建议的成就
    本报记者  培蓝
    在一个工地的办公室里，一位青年拿着一厚叠整理好的材料，请王月轩副经理（共产党员）批示印发。这是在安装七号机时苏联专家提出的先进经验。王副经理接过这个材料来和我说：“苏联专家到我们公司来，短短的几个月中，已经给我们提出了五百零八件先进经验。靠了这些经验的帮助，我们提前四天完成了伟大而又复杂的安装工程，而且质量达到了苏联设计标准。”
    三天学会了操作机器
    接着王副经理给我讲了一个生动的故事。
    在安装七号机时，苏联专家用三天时间，教会工人掌握苏联新式的离心式滤油机。在安装工作中，要安装一个大变压器，需用二百吨油。当时，公司有几台旧式的滤油纸式滤油机，但是这种滤油机一小时只能容一千五百公升，还必须要滤四十遍才能用。后来从苏联运来了几台新式的离心式滤油机，却没有一个人会操作。苏联专家莫尔恰诺夫同志来了，他了解了这个情况后，说：“只要有机器，工人不会操作不要紧，你们找六个工人来，我用三天时间就可以教会他们。”果然，过了三天，六个工人不仅学会了操作，而且学会了拆卸、安装、检修。
    徒工吴凤君、见习技术员李永成谈到莫尔恰诺夫同志是怎样教导他们掌握滤油机的技术时，一口气说完了教学过程：莫尔恰诺夫同志是那样耐心地教导我们。第一天，他教我们拆卸和安装机器。他亲自拆一件，给我们讲一件：这叫什么名字，它的性能与作用怎样，一件一件拆完了，然后再安装。安装时又一件一件地讲。莫尔恰诺夫同志作完了一遍以后，提出“那个勇敢，先试一次！”这时，年青小伙子冯成奎照着专家的作法，试了一遍。专家说
    “好，再来一个人”。以后我们每人照样轮流试一遍。就这样，经过一天的时间，离心式滤油机就驯驯服服地听从我们指挥了。第二天，莫尔恰诺夫同志指示我们擦洗机器和安装机器的附件。这时他又给讲了一遍。第三天，莫尔恰诺夫同志把着我们的手，一个一个地教我们试验操作。真的，第三天下午，我们自己就可以开动机器了。
    工人掌握了苏联先进的离心式滤油机后，滤三遍就可用，而且达到六万伏特耐压。而旧式的滤油纸式滤油机，要滤四十遍才可用，还只能达到四万伏特耐压。
    公司党委对于贯彻苏联专家建议是当做严重的政治任务来执行的。党委通过这个具体生动的事实，向全体职工进行了一系列的教育，指出“苏联的科学是世界上最先进的”，使广大职工更加深刻地体会到，必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。
    在紧急关头的共产党员
    三月十日，二十一工程公司党、行政、工会、青年团负责干部和安装队的全体职工，在万分紧张的气氛中，度过了这一天一夜。他们要在这二十四小时内，在苏联专家指导下，完成一件历史上从未有过的奇迹——解决安装七号机的关键之一的轮辐套轴的问题。按照过去老办法，要用轴装入轮辐，总共要二十一天才能完成，也就是把整个安装工程的时间占去了三分之一。苏联专家奥尔洛夫同志建议采用轮辐烧嵌的先进经验，使轮辐加温膨胀后套入轴内，只要二十四小时就能完成任务。
    这个工程是整个安装工程的重要环节，党委书记沈信祥、党委副书记韩艾英、副经理、安装总指挥王月轩等负责干部亲自在现场指挥。他们事先召开了党员、团员动员大会，党委书记沈信祥号召所有党、团员要带动全体职工，保证百分之百地执行苏联专家的建议，决不能有一点疏忽大意。因为如果那一个小的操作不符合要求，就会造成不可弥补的损失。
    施工中，奥尔洛夫同志首先教工人测量主轴的外径与轮辐的里径，计算两者相差多少。零一工地的场长庄玉荣、专责技术员张怀韬测量好了，又请奥尔洛夫同志校正了一遍，就决定实行轮辐烧嵌法。这个生疏而又紧要的工程，交给共产党员杨昌祯、陈斌等三班工人担任。紧急关头正是考验每个党员的时候，三班工人，不知疲劳地忙了一天一夜。奥尔洛夫和专家组长沙可夫等同志也没有离开过现场。
    二十三小时过去了。奥尔洛夫同志指导庄玉荣等在轮辐达到一百七十度的高温下，测量了最后一次膨胀系数。他说：“好了！”这时，几百双惊异的眼睛注视着共产党员赵洪福、柳香山谨慎小心地开动吊车，吊起沉重的轮辐慢慢地移动着。这时，所有的干部和工人的心像吊了千斤重的石头似地扑通扑通地跳着，大家都知道如果半小时以内套不上，那末整个机器就坏了。……分针走到二十三分钟时，轮辐又稳又准地落在主轴上。全场忽然响起了一片暴风雨般的掌声，热烈地祝贺苏联专家指导的成功。这是一个紧张惊人的场面，许多人回忆起这个情景时说：我们真不知道这一天一夜是怎么过的。你想，按苏联的先进经验作，二十四小时，按我们过去的办法作，二十一天。这实在太使我们兴奋了，难怪有些年青的工友伸着大拇指，对着那些抱怀疑态度的老师傅说：“怎么样，老师傅，看见了吧！二十四小时。”
    苏联专家每一句话都是宝贵的
    只在这时候，老技术员韩世昌才说出了自己的真心话。他说：“过去我总怕专家提出的计划实现不了，现在真是心服了。苏联专家提出的先进的科学的经验，比什么都管用，专家的每一句话都是宝贵的！”共产党员和工人们进一步认识了苏联先进经验的宝贵，掀起了学习先进经验的热潮。安装队党支部在公司党委领导下，进一步指出贯彻苏联专家建议是考核每个党、团员的政治觉悟的标尺之一，号召认真学习苏联先进经验，使技术提高一步！安装队行政上也规定了一系列的制度：建立了专家建议登记簿，组织了先进经验的研究组，规定每星期三、五为先进经验学习日。安装队团支部和工会也分别制订了公约，保证这一学习的进展。
    帮助中国人民按时完成安装任务，保证培养中国的工人干部是苏联专家互相竞赛的条件之一。中国的工人们用一切方法回答苏联专家的伟大无私的援助和谆谆的教导。共产党员陈斌和老技工姚德信所领导的小组首先建立了技术研究会，每天下班后，开会检查对专家建议的执行情况，交换学习心得。陈斌经过轮辐烧嵌的工作，对苏联专家的每一句话都记在心里。他把所有亲手安装过的机器都画出来，标明机件的名称与性能，并且记了各种施工方法及其理论。陈斌说：“我文化程度低，记不完全。不过我心里记的比抄在笔记簿上的多得多。”
    为了使每个职工都能掌握一门技术，公司党委要求全体职工“由不懂到懂，由不熟练到熟练，由熟练到精通，求得专业知识，精通一门。”这个号召得到了全体职工的热烈响应，每个职工都准备了一个小本子，记录先进经验。刚从农村到公司来的共产党员白贞，是一个一字不识的青年。放下锄头拿起仪器，在有些人看来这是千难万难的事。但是，他没有被困难吓倒，他现在已经熟悉了他所作的全部工作，并且学会了测量中心线、钻眼、套丝等技术工人的工作。每当他想起苏联专家的工作精神，他就坐卧不安，睡觉都睡不好。他常常睡梦中梦着自己已经会画图了，他兴奋地惊醒过来，开开灯，把梦中领会的图画下来，直到画不出来的时候。第二天，他到现场工作了一天，晚上回家再画，就这样天天画，现在他已经把他所安装的全部机器都画出来了，而且画的还很正确。开始他不会写字，现在他已经认识一千多字，可以写出机器的名称，还可以记一些简单的操作规程和工作日记。这里，可以看到苏联专家伟大的国际主义精神和中国工人高涨的学习热忱交织在一起所发生的力量是多么的巨大。
    技术人员能否直接听取专家建议，对加速工程建设起着重大的作用。公司党委特别注意了技术人员的学习问题。党委曾通过组织学习文件、开座谈会、组织先进人物的报告会、图片展览等方式，提高他们的政治觉悟。零三工地、配车、土木场的技术人员在学习文件后，联名写信给党支部，表示决心向苏联学习，保证作好工作。党委对于个别有抵触思想的老技术人员采取耐心教育的态度。零二工地技术员郑贤文在安装某机器时，苏联专家谢敏尔宁建议作四个一百三十五粍的木楔子，他却根据自己的狭隘经验，作了四个一百三十粍的木楔子。结果证明，郑贤文作的四个木楔子根本不能用。安装队党支部及时召开了各种会议，通过这个事实，批判各种不正确的思想，表扬虚心学习先进经验、执行专家建议的青年技术员陈汉民，给技术人员树立了学习的榜样。这个事实，对大家教育意义很深。
    中国的斯大哈诺夫工作者
    在苏联专家、苏联斯大哈诺夫工作者的指导下，二十一工程公司也出现了中国的斯大哈诺夫工作者。在下线圈工程中，年青共产党员赵光荣创造了奇迹。过去赵光荣根本没有作过这个活。但是，他有一颗坚强的学习技术的决心。他留心瞅着专家的每一个动作，开始，他慢慢地模仿。后来，在专家亲自指导与鼓舞下，他放开胆子干起来，开始作十五个、十七个，后来达到二十一个。但赵光荣还不满足，他捉摸怎样能作得更快更好。该他工作的时候，他专心一意工作，该他休息的时候，他观看别人怎么作，随着就自己空手练习起来。同时他又向技术员陈汉民请教，这样，他终于摸到了操作规律，创造了二十七个的最高纪录。米哈宜诺夫同志看到徒弟比老师干活好的时候，高兴得跳起来。奥尔洛夫同志特地给公司领导干部说：“米哈宜诺夫同志作卷线工作已有二十七年多了，他在苏联创造了最高纪录，荣获斯大哈诺夫工作者的荣誉，赵光荣应该是中国的斯大哈诺夫工作者。”
    在二十一工程公司像赵光荣一样的生产能手不是个别的。零二工地在安装某种机器时，需要将机器本身突出的地方削平，当时用风铲铲，电钻钻，一班八个人只能铲一个，效率很低。共产党员李长荣根据苏联的先进经验，创造了手动车床，用这个车床，一班只要四五个人就可以车三个，最快的车四个，保证了工程提前完成。苏联专家一致称赞中国工人的聪明勇敢。但是，中国工人们懂得：如果没有苏联专家的亲切指导，没有党组织坚决领导贯彻苏联专家的建议，就不会有这些成就。
