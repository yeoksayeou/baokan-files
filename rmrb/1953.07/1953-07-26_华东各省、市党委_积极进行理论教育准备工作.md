East China's provinces and municipalities party committees are actively preparing for various tasks, such as reviewing study plans and training theoretical instructors, in accordance with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on cadre theoretical education for 1953-1954 and the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's notice on the implementation of these instructions. Currently, first-level organs in East China and various provinces and cities have organized study advisory groups or lecturer groups, with a total of 192 advisors and lecturers. The Shandong Provincial Direct Organs Lecturer Group, consisting of 30 people, under the guidance of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, has been divided into four groups to compile teaching outlines for Chapters 9 to 12 of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." It has been decided that after each chapter outline is drafted, the Propaganda Department will convene a meeting of theoretical instructors and education section chiefs from the prefectural and municipal party committees to study the methods of instruction. The work of training part-time theoretical instructors and study counselors in various regions mostly began after June. East China-level organs and the Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provincial and municipal-level organs have trained or are about to begin training a total of 1,400 intermediate-level study counselors. In addition, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have also established theoretical instructor research classes to train intermediate-level theoretical instructors and study counselors for the prefectural and municipal party committees. Fujian has trained 599 part-time junior instructors and study counselors. In terms of equipping and training full-time theoretical instructors: in addition to the original 69 people trained at the East China Bureau Party School and 100 people at the Shandong Political School, the East China Bureau Party School plans to train another group of intermediate-level theoretical instructors after the end of the current theory class. In addition, Fujian is training 85 junior instructors, and Zhejiang began training 200 junior instructors in July. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee has decided to establish four full-time intermediate-level theoretical instructors in provincial-level organs, and one in each prefectural and municipal party committee organ; one junior full-time theoretical instructor will be established for every 500 students or so.
    In addition, the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau and the Propaganda Departments of the Zhejiang and Anhui Provincial Party Committees have begun to establish study rooms, and other provinces and cities are also preparing to establish them. To improve intermediate and junior-level study, provincial and municipal-level organs have begun to pilot spare-time political schools.
    Currently, East China's provinces and municipalities are concentrating their efforts on intensifying various preparatory tasks, and formal study will begin in September.
