Jinxi Chemical Factory Health Personnel Treat Workers in Workshops

Northeast Jinxi Chemical Factory No. 2 Factory's Second Clinic health personnel, under the slogan "Health work oriented towards production, oriented towards the workshop," improved their medical style and working methods. As a result, the health of all factory employees has significantly changed, and the workers' attendance rate has also greatly improved.

The Second Clinic has one doctor, one medical assistant, and several nurses. They are responsible for the medical, preventive, and healthcare work of all factory workers, seeing patients at the clinic during the day and making house calls at night. Before the factory launched a labor competition in May 1952, health personnel generally believed that with so few medical staff and so many patients at the clinic, it was impossible to go to the workshops to treat workers. They spent their days waiting for patients to come to the clinic and rarely considered how to do prevention work among the workers. Therefore, the workers raised many opinions about the work of the clinic. Some workers said, "The doctors don't examine patients carefully and are arrogant; the nurses' work is also slow and has a 'young lady' style." When the health personnel heard these words, they were very unconvinced and said, "The workers are just looking for our trouble; working in this profession means being angry day and night."

In May last year, the entire factory launched a labor competition. To improve the workers' health, all health personnel at the clinic resolved to improve the clinic's work. The factory's administrative leaders also provided them with support. On the one hand, they organized and mobilized health personnel to go deep into the workshops, so that the health personnel could understand the workers' existing labor conditions and production situation; on the other hand, they called on the workshop directors to provide the health personnel with all necessary conveniences, so that they could understand the factory's production situation and the workers' labor conditions in detail. After several days of experience, the health personnel realized the relationship between the production environment, labor conditions, and worker health, and understood the great significance of health work being oriented towards production and serving production. They then overcame their past conservative thinking and adopted a method that combined treatment and prevention, going to the workshops to treat workers.

Occupational diseases are relatively serious in chemical factories. In order to prevent the development of occupational diseases, the health personnel of the clinic actively treated the workers and jointly studied methods to prevent these diseases with the workers. For example, many workers in Workshop 201 suffered from "blackhead disease" (facial darkening). Although the clinic prepared some ointments for them to apply, they were ineffective. Once, when a doctor went to the workshop, he found that worker Gong Qingshan's skin color was normal, so he asked him the reason why he did not get the disease. Gong Qingshan said, "It's very simple, I immediately wash my hands and face with clean water as soon as I get off work. The reason why this disease occurs among workers is mostly due to a lack of attention to daily hygiene. After work, they often wash in the same basin with several people, and as a result, no one washes cleanly." The doctor introduced Gong Qingshan's experience to everyone during health class. For example, 70 percent of the workers in the chlorine gas section suffer from indigestion. After investigation, it was discovered that the main reason for this disease was that workers did not pay attention to dietary hygiene and overate. The doctor then asked experienced workers to conduct health education for everyone, explaining the harm of overeating to the stomach and intestines.

The doctors also improved their work style. For example, when they discovered a widespread disease in the clinic, they immediately went to the workshop and cafeteria to investigate the cause of the disease. Once, it was discovered that many workers in Workshop 203 suffered from anemia. The doctor traced the disease from the workshop to the cafeteria and finally discovered that the cause of the disease was a lack of Vitamin B. The doctor then suggested to the cafeteria to improve the cooking method, not to remove the rice bran when cooking, and to retain the rice soup. For example, many workers in Workshop 202 suffered from loss of appetite and other symptoms. The doctor studied the workers' diet and went to the workshop to understand that the workers rarely drank water during the production process. Based on this situation, the doctor conducted education for the workers during health class.

In order to shorten the time workers spend seeing a doctor, the health personnel divided the workshops into responsibility areas and designated special personnel to be responsible for the medical and preventive work in each area. Eye wash stations and medication stations were also set up in the workshops. During breaks, or when chemical dust was found to be harming their eyes, or when they discovered coughing and poisoning due to chlorine gas spills, workers could go to the eye wash station to wash their eyes and go to the medication station to take cough syrup. This not only alleviated the workers' pain from illness and prevented the development of disease, but also changed the crowded situation at the clinic.

The health work of the Second Clinic is carried out in coordination with the workshop labor insurance committee. When accidents occur among workers, the labor insurance committee immediately notifies the clinic for first aid. For example, one evening, workers in a workshop suddenly suffered from gas poisoning. After receiving the notification from the labor insurance committee, the clinic immediately sent a doctor to the scene for first aid, saving two workers who were on the verge of death.

The improvement of health work in Jinxi Chemical Factory has reduced the incidence of disease among all factory workers. For example, the incidence of disease in March 1952 was 51 percent, while the incidence of disease in the same month this year was 24 percent. The clinic work is also not as busy as it used to be, and the doctor only needs to spend six hours a day to see all the outpatients. At the same time, due to the good preventive work and timely treatment, the number of house calls has also decreased. This has given the doctors time to study, research, and rest.

    锦西化学工厂卫生人员到车间给工人治病
    东北锦西化学工厂二厂第二分诊所的卫生人员，在“卫生工作面向生产，面向车间”的口号下，改进了医疗作风和工作方法。全厂职工的健康状况因而有了显著的改变，工人的出勤率也大大提高了。
    第二分诊所有医生、医士各一人和护士若干人。他们担负着全厂工人的医疗预防保健工作，白天在门诊处给工人看病，晚上还得出诊。在一九五二年五月该厂开展劳动竞赛以前，卫生人员普遍认为，医务人员这样少，而门诊处的病人又多，要到车间里去给工人治病是不可能的。他们整天守在诊所里等病人上门，很少考虑如何做好工人中的防治工作。因此，工人对分诊所的工作提出了很多的意见。有的工人说：“大夫看病既不仔细，架子又大；护士的工作也拖沓，有小姐作风。”卫生人员听了这些话，心里很不服气，说：“工人尽找我们的麻烦，干这行真是白天晚上受气。”
    去年五月间，全厂展开了劳动竞赛。为了改善工人的健康状况，分诊所全体卫生人员决心改进诊所的工作。工厂行政领导方面也给予他们以支持。一方面组织和动员卫生人员深入车间，使卫生人员了解工人现有的劳动条件和生产情况；一方面号召车间主任给卫生人员以一切便利条件，让他们详细了解厂内的生产情况和工人的劳动条件。经过几天的体验，卫生人员都认识了生产环境、劳动条件和工人健康的关系，并了解了卫生工作面向生产并为生产服务的重大意义。他们便克服了过去的保守思想，采取治疗和预防相结合的办法，到车间里去给工人治疗。
    化学工厂的职业病是比较严重的。分诊所的卫生人员为了防止职业病的发展，一面积极给工人进行治疗，一面和工人共同研究防止这一疾病的方法。例如二○一车间有许多工人患“黑头病”（面部发黑），分诊所虽然配制了一些药膏给他们涂抹，但不见效。有一次大夫下车间时，发现工人巩清山肤色正常，于是问他没有得病的原因。巩清山说：“这很简单，我每天一下班，马上用清水把手、脸洗干净。工人中发生这种病的原因，多半是不注意日常卫生，他们下班后往往几个人在同一只盆内洗，结果谁也没有洗干净。”大夫就在上卫生课时把巩清山的经验介绍给大家。又如氯气工段的工人，有百分之七十患消化不良症。经过调查，发现了引起这一疾病的主要原因是工人不注意饮食卫生，暴饮暴食。大夫就请有经验的工人向大家进行卫生教育，说明暴饮暴食对肠胃的害处。
    大夫们也改进了自己的工作作风。例如，当他们在门诊中发现了带普遍性的疾病以后，立即到车间、食堂追查发生疾病的原因。有一次发现二○三车间有很多工人患贫血症，大夫就从车间查到食堂，终于发现了疾病发生的原因是缺少乙种维生素。于是医生便向食堂建议：改善做饭的方法，在做饭时不把米坯去掉，保留米汤。又如二○二车间有不少工人患食欲不振等症。大夫就一面研究工人的饮食情况，一面深入车间了解，发现工人在生产过程中很少饮水。根据这种情形，大夫在上卫生课时向工人进行了教育。
    为了缩短工人看病的时间，卫生人员在车间划分了责任区，并指定专人负责每一区的医疗预防工作。又在车间设立了洗眼站和服药站。工人在休息时，或发现化学物粉尘侵害到自己的眼睛时，或是因氯气外溢而发现咳呛中毒的现象时，都可以到洗眼站去洗眼，到服药站服止咳药水。这样，不仅减轻了工人的疾病痛苦、防止了疾病的发展，而且改变了门诊处病人拥挤的状况。
    第二分诊所的卫生工作，是在车间劳动保险委员的配合下进行的。当工人中发生意外的事情时，劳动保险委员就马上通知分诊所进行急救。例如，有一天晚间，车间工人突然发生瓦斯中毒。分诊所接到劳动保险委员的通知以后，即派医生到现场进行急救，将濒于死亡状态的两个工友挽救过来。
    锦西化学工厂卫生工作的改善，降低了全厂工人的发病率。例如一九五二年三月的发病率为百分之五十一，今年同月的发病率则为百分之二十四。门诊工作也不像过去那样忙乱了，大夫每天只要用六个小时即可看完门诊病人。同时，由于预防工作做得好，治疗及时，出诊的次数也减少了。这样就使大夫们得到了学习、研究和休息的时间。
