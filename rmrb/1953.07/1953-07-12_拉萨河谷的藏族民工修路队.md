    Tibetan Road Construction Team in the Lhasa River Valley
    Guo Xinke
    The Lhasa River Valley is a densely populated and fertile area with continuous wheat fields on the Kangzang Plateau. A Tibetan road construction team is building a road in the valley, which is part of the great Kangzang Highway.
    The road in the Lhasa River Valley is being built under the joint leadership of the Tibetan local government and the Tibet Military Region. This Tibetan road construction team, consisting of both men and women, was gathered from the Lhasa River Valley and surrounding areas. In the beginning, most of the workers, who had never seen a road before, were unfamiliar with road construction work. However, influenced by the heroic PLA troops working alongside them and with the help of PLA staff and engineers leading them, these Tibetan workers participating in the road construction gradually became skilled road builders.
    East of Mozhugongka, there is a section of "rubber" road with mud and waterlogged turf about one meter deep. The road construction workers had to go down into the muddy pits, which were deeper than their knees, to work, digging out the mud and turf and then laying in stones and dirt. The enthusiastic road construction workers ran barefoot across sections of prickly grassland to fetch stones from the hillside six or seven hundred meters away. The Tibetan workers worked enthusiastically, improving the quality and efficiency of their work by more than double.
    In the organized collective life of the Tibetan workers, they competed and helped each other at the same time. The various *zubens* (teams) of Tibetan workers competed to complete their daily tasks earlier and more completely. While the workers were working, one could often hear the encouraging slogan "Huda Boda (Add Oil!)" Several *zubens* maintained a good record of over-fulfilling their tasks every day. Moreover, when the *zubens* that completed their tasks first saw that some *zubens* were lagging behind, they would run to help the other *zubens* so that the entire work area could quickly complete the road construction task for the day. Take the work of the fifth *jiaben* (company) on one day, for example: four *zubens* that finished their tasks first went to help the other four *zubens*. Countless moving events like this occurred!
    Here, we also want to tell a story: One day, on a steep slope east of Mozhugongka, the workers of the second *jiaben* were working. Suddenly, a large stone rolled down with the soil, and the people below were frightened. At this moment, a mute worker from the seventh *zuben* who was standing halfway up the slope hurriedly put down his pickaxe and rushed forward selflessly, pressing the stone down with his stomach. The nervous workers were deeply moved by the mute man's actions and praised him endlessly. This mute worker could not express his feelings in words, nor could he express his thoughts in Tibetan; however, he used selfless action to show the noble qualities and ingenuity of the Tibetan people!
    What is the source of the diligence and wisdom shown by the Tibetan workers in road construction?
    Let us listen to what the workers themselves have to say. Cilinbo and Taijie, two Tibetan workers from the fourth *jiaben* who are active in road construction, said: "When the road is completed, goods and machines from the inland can be transported to Tibet, and our local products can also be transported out, so our lives can be better." Bala, the 65-year-old head of the first *ruben* (battalion) of Mozhugongka, is one of the active leaders in road construction. He said: "I am old, and maybe I won't enjoy more happiness, but I still have my sons and grandsons who can enjoy a happy life."
    The Tibetan workers not only see this bright prospect, but they also feel from their own lives that they are living in a happy big family. They receive reasonable wages and eat enough *zanba* in their road construction work; when they are sick, there are PLA clinics to treat them; and during the busy farming season, the workers can stop working and go home to harvest highland barley. Maya, a Tibetan member of the Road Construction Committee who leads the road construction, said with emotion: "The PLA cares for the workers in every possible way."
    The Tibetan workers, who love to sing and dance, sing even more joyfully while working, while washing their hands and faces in the stream after work, on the way to work in formation, and in the neatly arranged tents. Every ten days, under the bright moonlight, they light bonfires, and accompanied by the sound of gurgling streams, Tibetan men and women dance together. Many people have also learned to sing many new songs in Tibetan and Chinese, and they sing joyfully: "Sing of our dear motherland, moving towards happiness, prosperity, and strength."
    Now, a smooth and straight section of road has appeared in the Lhasa River Valley. None of the Tibetan people's mule caravans, the herders riding horses and herding cattle and sheep, the farmers carrying farm tools to the fields, or the lamas going to Lhasa to worship fail to praise and say: "Jialang (Great Road) Yam Yam (Very Good)!"

### 拉萨河谷的藏族民工修路队

    拉萨河谷的藏族民工修路队
    郭辛可
    拉萨河谷是康藏高原上一块人烟稠密，麦田连绵的富庶之区，藏族民工筑路队正在河谷里修筑一条公路。这条公路就是伟大的康藏公路的一部分。
    拉萨河谷里的公路是在西藏地方政府和西藏军区共同领导下进行修建的。这支有男有女的藏族民工队，是从拉萨河谷和附近地区集中起来的。刚开始的时候，绝大部分从来没有见过公路的民工对修路工作很生疏。但是，在和他们一起修路的解放军英雄部队的影响下，在带领他们修路的解放军工作人员与工程人员的帮助下，这批参加修筑公路的西藏民工，逐渐变成了熟练的公路修筑者。
    在墨竹工卡的东边，有一段“橡皮”路，那里有一公尺左右深的泥水和草皮，修路的民工必须下到深及膝盖以上的泥水坑里去工作，挖出泥水、草皮，然后铺进石头和泥土。热情的修路民工们赤着脚跑过一段段刺脚的草地，到六、七百公尺外的山坡取来石块。藏族民工热情地劳动，提高了工作质量，也提高了工作效率一倍以上。
    在藏族民工们有组织的集体生活中，他们一面进行竞赛，一面又相互帮助。藏族民工的各个足本（班）之间，争着提早和更多的完成每天的任务。在民工工作的时候，常常可以听到“呼达伯达（加油干）！”的鼓动口号。有好几个足本每天都保持着超额完成任务的良好记录。而且，当先完成任务的足本看到有些足本落后时，他们就跑去帮助别的足本，使整个工区都能迅速完成当天的修路任务。拿第五甲本（连）的一天工作来说，就有四个先完成任务的足本去帮助另外四个足本。这种动人的事迹不知道有多少件！
    这里，我们还要讲一个故事：有一天，在墨竹工卡东边的陡坡上，第二甲本的民工正在工作。突然，一块大石头和着土一起往下直滚，底下的人都吓慌了；这时，站在半腰的第七足本的一个哑吧民工就急忙放下洋镐，奋不顾身的直扑过去，把石头压倒在自己的肚子下。紧张着的民工们被哑吧的行动深深感动了，不住称赞着他。这位哑吧民工，他不能用言语来表现他自己的感情，他又不能用藏文来表达自己的思想；然而，他用舍身为人的行动来表现了藏族人民的崇高品质与机智！
    藏族民工们在修路中所表现的勤劳与智慧的源泉是什么呢？
    让我们来听听民工们自己的话吧。第四甲本的慈林波和泰杰两个藏族民工是修路的积极分子，他们说：“公路修通了，内地的货物、机器可以运到西藏来，我们的土产也可以运出去，我们的生活就能过得好了。”墨竹工卡第一如本（营）的负责人六十五岁的巴拉是修路中的积极领导者之一，他说：“我年纪已大，或者享受不到更多的幸福，但是，我还有我的儿子、孙子，可以享受到幸福的生活。”
    藏族民工们不但看到这种幸福的远景，而且，他们从自己的生活中感到他们是生活在一个幸福的大家庭里，他们在修路的劳动中获得合理的工资，吃到足够的?粑；他们生病的时候，有解放军的诊疗所给他们治病；在农忙的时候，民工们就可以停工回家去收割青稞。领导修路的修路委员会藏族委员马亚感动的说：“解放军关心民工真是无微不至。”
    善歌爱舞的藏族民工，在劳动的时候，在工作完毕后于小溪洗濯手脸的时候，在整队上工的路上，在整齐地排列着的帐篷里，更加欢乐地歌唱。每隔十天，在明晶的月色下，他们燃起火堆，伴着哗哗的溪水声，男女藏胞们在一起欢舞。许多人还学会唱许多藏文和汉文的新歌，他们欢乐地唱着：“歌唱我们亲爱的祖国，走向幸福繁荣富强。”
    现在，在拉萨河谷里已经出现了一段光滑平直的公路。藏族人民的骡商队，骑着马赶着牛羊的牧民，背着农具上田里去的农民，到拉萨去朝拜的喇嘛们，没有一个不赞美说：“加郎（大道）雅姆雅姆（很好）！”
