Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Albania have begun harvesting, and the level of mechanization of harvesting has been improved.

　　Wheat harvesting has started in almost all parts of Bulgaria by the end of June. About 1,500 combine harvesters, 1,500 binding machines, and 4,000 threshing machines are working in the fields. This year, 50 percent of the crops will be harvested by machines, and more than 90 percent of the threshing will be done by machines. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this year's harvesting work, the state and district committees of the Bulgarian Communist Party carried out a series of organizational tasks in the period before the start of harvesting, such as holding representative meetings of state and district party organizations, exchanging advanced work experience of party organizations in production cooperatives, paying attention to assigning specific tasks to rural party members, strengthening guidance on pre-harvest mobilization work, and ensuring accelerated completion of the repair work of agricultural machinery stations.

　　Romania also began field harvesting at the end of June. The number of machines used for harvesting this year has greatly increased compared to previous years. In state-owned farms, the number of combine harvesters alone has increased by 73 percent. On the fields of collective farms and mutual aid teams, the number of cutting and binding machines alone has increased by 120 percent, and the number of electric motors has increased by 126 percent. It is estimated that the total workload of harvesting machines in this harvest season will increase by 134 percent compared to the same period last year.

　　Many regions of the Hungarian People's Republic began harvesting barley in late June. By June 29, 150 state-owned farms and many agricultural production cooperatives were engaged in harvesting work. Currently, hundreds of combine harvesters are working intensely in the fields. It is estimated that more than 1,200 combine harvesters will be used nationwide this year. Now, combine harvester operators have launched a competition to strive for each harvester to harvest at least 400 holds (each hold is approximately equivalent to 8.55 mu) of crops and thresh at least 400,000 kilograms.

　　The harvesting of wheat, oats, barley, and rye has begun in Albania. Agricultural production cooperatives are carrying out harvesting in an organized manner, with higher efficiency than individual farmers. By June 21, individual farmers had harvested 10 percent of their crops, while agricultural production cooperatives had harvested 14 percent. Most of the cooperative's harvesting work is done by combine harvesters, and threshing work has also been automated. The cooperative can harvest an average of 2,000 to 3,000 kilograms of wheat per hectare.

    保、罗、匈、阿等国开始进行田间收割
    收割工作的机械化水平已经提高
    【新华社六日讯】保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚已经开始进行收割，收割工作的机械化水平已经提高。
    保加利亚全国各地在六月底差不多都已开始了小麦的收割工作。约有一千五百架收割联合机、一千五百架捆禾机和四千架打谷机正在田间工作着。今年将有百分之五十的庄稼用机器收割，将有百分之九十以上的打谷工作用机器进行。早在收割开始前的一段时期内，保加利亚共产党的各州、区委员会为了保证今年收割工作的顺利进行，就曾进行了一系列的组织工作，如召开州和区党组织的代表会议，交流生产合作社党组织的先进工作经验，注意分配给农村党员以具体的任务，加强对收割前鼓动工作的指导，和保证加速完成农业机器站的修理工作等。
    罗马尼亚也在六月底开始了田间的收割工作。今年收割使用的机器比往年大为增加。在国营农场，单是联合机就增加了百分之七十三。在集体农庄和共耕互助社的田地上，单是割捆机就增加了百分之一百二十，电动机增加了百分之一百二十六。预计在本收割季节内，收割机器的工作总量要比去年同期增加百分之一百三十四。
    匈牙利人民共和国的许多地区从六月下旬开始收割大麦。到六月二十九日，进行收割工作的就有一百五十个国营农场和许多农业生产合作社。目前，正有几百架收割联合机在田野上紧张地活动着。估计今年全国使用的收割联合机将达一千二百多架。现在，收割联合机手们已经展开了竞赛，争取每架收割机至少收割四百霍尔德（每霍尔德约合八点五五市亩）的庄稼，至少打谷四十万公斤。
    阿尔巴尼亚的小麦、燕麦、大麦和黑麦的收获工作已经开始。各农业生产合作社都是有组织地进行收割，效率比个体农户高。到六月二十一日，单干户的庄稼收割了百分之十，而农业生产合作社就收割了百分之十四。合作社的收割工作大部分都是用收割联合机来进行的，打谷工作也已实行自动化。合作社平均每公顷可以收获二千公斤到三千公斤小麦。
