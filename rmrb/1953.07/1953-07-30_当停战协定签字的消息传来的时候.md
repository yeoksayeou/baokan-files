    When the News of the Armistice Agreement Signing Arrived
    Yu Li
    "I'm Happy, I'm Vigilant"
    This is a hospital housing wounded and sick志愿军 soldiers. When the news of the Korean Armistice Agreement signing was broadcast from the loudspeakers, they all listened with bated breath.

    Zou Lizhai, a志愿军 soldier who lost his ability to speak due to a mouth injury, immediately wrote the following two sentences on a clean white sheet of paper after hearing the broadcast: "Resolutely support the armistice agreement. I'm happy, I'm vigilant," to express his feelings. In fact, this wasn't just his sentiment alone; it was the shared sentiment of all the wounded and sick志愿军 soldiers in this hospital. These heroes who had sacrificed their blood and flesh for the safety of the motherland and the peace of Korea deeply understood the significance and the cost of the Korean armistice. Luo Shiding, a first-class meritorious志愿军 soldier who had been wounded three times, stroked his right leg, which still contained shrapnel, and said, "The Korean armistice was hard-won; this is the price, and it's also the proof." This was the injury he sustained in June 1952 when he repelled the enemy's attack on Tank Hill on the Korean front. He bled, but the enemy's attack was repelled. Now, every inch of free land in Korea has been bought with the same significant price. Thinking that peace had finally arrived, albeit preliminarily, and that his blood had not been shed in vain, Luo Shiding said with a proud expression, "This proves that it is impossible for imperialism to subdue the Korean people by force." After a pause, he added, "But it seems that the American warmongers and the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique have not learned their lesson. We should remember the orders of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai and must be vigilant."

    Speaking of vigilance,志愿军 soldier Chen Liangda, whose wound had not yet healed, seemed particularly agitated. He remembered Platoon Leader Yao Qingxiang, who was performing guard duties in Kaesong during the armistice negotiations and was shot and killed by American devils. He also remembered the Korean child who was bombed to death by American devils in Panmunjom during the armistice negotiations. Kaesong and Panmunjom were both neutral zones, established through mutual agreement! However, the American devils both reached agreements and violated them.

    "Yes, we must be vigilant," Chen Liangda concluded. "We cannot forget the blood of Martyr Yao Qingxiang and that Korean child. We are naturally happy that the armistice agreement has been signed, but will they destroy this agreement again? We must keep an eye on them."

    Step Up Production, Strengthen the Power of Peace

    Amidst the roar of machinery, the news of the armistice agreement signing reached the Shijingshan Power Plant. Old worker Zhao Runqing immediately thought of Korea, devastated by the war, and how it now had to begin to recover and rebuild. A sense of internationalist responsibility moved him, and he said, "I have a wish. I am prepared to help the Korean people restore their cities and factories, just as the Soviet comrades helped us with our construction." This old worker proposed: the armistice is good, and in order to support the armistice, we must step up production and strengthen the forces of defending peace. Finally, he spoke proudly of his power plant.

    "Electricity," he said, "is the driving force of all industrial development. I must learn the technical operating procedures well to ensure that the machines in Beijing's factories run non-stop for even a minute."

    Wang Jingshao, an old worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant who had written three letters to the志愿军 this year reporting on production, said after hearing the news of the armistice, "Steel in my hands is a powerful guarantee for defending peace. We must work hard to produce steel, strengthen national defense, and strengthen the forces of defending peace."

    Help the Korean People Rebuild Their Peaceful Homeland

    "Help the Korean people rebuild their homes." This sentence is resonating at Beijing Agricultural University. A Communist Youth League group in the Department of Plant Sciences had just finished their graduation exams when they received the news of the Korean armistice agreement signing. On this day, they also received their first letter from Yao Xianru, a "mine-clearing hero" of a certain unit of the志愿军. "This is an extraordinary day," these young students couldn't help but cheer. At the forum, Zheng Jialan first read the contents of the letter: "...Seeing the guarantees put forward by your group is like hearing the voices of young people across the country. I wish you victory." After reading the letter, Zheng Jialan said as if making an oath, "We must not fail to live up to this hero's expectations! We are the first group of people to participate in the country's large-scale economic construction. So our current task is to work hard to participate in national construction and vigilantly monitor the implementation of the armistice agreement. If necessary, we are willing to help the Korean people rebuild their homes."

    Zheng Jialan's words resonated with the students. Yu Bingxiang, a third-year student in the Department of Agronomy, recently received ninety-eight letters from Korean orphans in China. In the letters, in addition to reporting on their happy lives in China and expressing their determination, the children also drew portraits of Marshal Kim Il-sung, national flags, portraits of themselves wearing red scarves, colorful doves of peace, and all kinds of flowers on the letter paper and envelopes. The children's experiences and feelings deeply moved him, and he had long been determined to help the Korean people build their homeland in the future. "Now, I am getting closer and closer to realizing my ambition!" When he spoke, it was as if he had already seen the beautiful scenery of Korea's future. "If needed," added Zhao Hanzhang, a first-year student in the Department of Animal Husbandry, "I will help the Korean people with their construction like the Soviet people helped us. I will build countless pastures there, raise countless livestock, and produce large amounts of milk to nurture those Korean children who have suffered from the war!"

    The students of the attached girls' middle school of Beijing Normal University, who have close ties with the志愿军, are thinking more about their close friends – the志愿军. Class 1 of Senior Three, whose average score in the graduation exam was 89.7, winning the school's "Excellent Award Flag," is preparing to write to their志愿军 friends again. They think: their friends will receive these letters not in a war-torn environment, but on a peaceful front where the smoke of gunfire has dissipated. "But," said Luo Lin, a student in this class, "we must continue to use the spirit of the志愿军 to strictly demand ourselves, study and work hard!" Next to her, Xia Rong interjected, "We also want to tell them: we are also watching how the enemy implements the armistice agreement!"

    "The Common People Are Not What They Used To Be"

    When the news of the armistice agreement signing reached the Anfu Hutong Police Station in the Xidan District, the residents there were exercising their sacred democratic rights – conducting the general election of grassroots political power. In a crowd in an election shed, you could hear the sharp voice of a housewife counting votes. Several small blackboards were hanging on the wall, densely covered with the character "正," and you could see at a glance that Wang Suqin had received the most votes. At this time, Wang Suqin was checking the quilts that they were sewing for the志愿军 in a room of the street women's production group. Her face was full of smiles as she said, "These are all made by our women for the志愿军. We originally planned to complete 4,700 pieces by mid-August, but now that we have heard the news of the armistice, we are even more motivated, and we may even complete them ahead of schedule!" On many corners of the quilts, there were hand stamps, names, or other marks. Wang Suqin said excitedly, "Everyone wants the志愿军 to know their names. Although we haven't been to Korea, our hearts have arrived..."

    Speaking of the general election, she quickly said, "We have to thank Chairman Mao and the志愿军 for this! We are having a general election, and the Korean armistice agreement has been signed, everyone says: we are experiencing double happiness!" Then she said seriously, "Comrades, the common people are not what they used to be, we can criticize anything. Although the war has stopped this time, we all know the enemy's tricks and we must be vigilant!"

    Joy and Hope

    At nine o'clock in the evening, on the Korean battlefield, the gunshots that had been ringing for three years and one month fell silent. The志愿军 soldiers, far away from their motherland, must be leaning on their guns, thinking of their beloved motherland, hometown, and relatives, as they celebrate their victory! At this time, the courtyard of the military dependent, Old Lady Song, in the Haidian District of Beijing was lively. Her youngest son and daughter had returned for summer vacation, and her eldest son and daughter-in-law were also on vacation at home. Two pairs of grandchildren, some were fast asleep on the cool mats, and some were still nursing in their mothers' arms. The radio sent out the news of the Korean armistice agreement signing, adding great joy to the family. Two members of this family are on the front lines in Korea – the fourth son is a志愿军 air force pilot, and the second daughter is in the literary troupe of the志愿军 railway corps. The third daughter took out the letters that her brother and sister had recently sent from the front lines and read them with great interest. The letters said: "We will not fail to live up to our parents' expectations. We will return to see our motherland and our beloved parents with glory and victory. This day will come soon. What will you use to answer the motherland?" The younger sisters and brothers' answers to their older brother and sister are: studying for the motherland, the total average scores this year are 93 and 84 points. The youngest sister innocently calculates the days of her brother and sister's return. Seeing the children so happy, the mother also smiled, but her face immediately became serious again, as if instructing her children and explaining at the same time: "We still have to hold our guns and watch out for the wolves, Syngman Rhee's heart is not dead and he is still making trouble..." The heart of a great mother, having endured three years of separation, has been tempered to be stronger. She paused and added, "It's not just our family, only with a country can we have a home."

    Here is the home of Bai Xiuzhen, a young military dependent in Sanlihe Village. She was originally a peasant woman. Now, dozens of building frames stand next to this village, and tens of thousands of workers are working hard. Where sorghum once grew, dozens of tall state buildings will rise. The tomorrow of national construction is inspiring her. When the state requisitioned her land, she decided to go to the surveying team to study with full enthusiasm to serve the country's construction. Now, she is excitedly packing her luggage. New blue cloth uniforms, floral muslin shirts, floral quilts, new towels, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soap are scattered on the kang. The armistice news has added to her joy. She believes that when peace in Korea is completely realized and her lover returns, she will have mastered the skills.

    "Now?" she replied, "The Korean issue has not yet been resolved peacefully, and I haven't learned anything yet, what will I use to see him!" (Attached pictures)

    当停战协定签字的消息传来的时候
    余力
    “我高兴，我警惕”
    这里是住着志愿军伤病员的一个医院。当朝鲜停战协定签字的消息从扩音器中播送出来的时候，他们都屏息静听着。
    嘴上负伤，失去说话能力的志愿军伤员邹立斋，听了广播之后立即在一张洁白的纸上写了这样两句话：“坚决拥护停战协定，我高兴，我警惕。”来表示他的心情。其实，这何止是他一个人的心情，也正是住在这个医院的所有志愿军伤病员共有的心情。这些为了祖国安全和朝鲜和平而曾经献出了血肉的英雄们，深刻地体会到朝鲜停战的意义和代价。负伤三次的志愿军一等功臣罗时鼎抚摸着还残留有炮弹片的右腿说：“朝鲜停战，好不容易，这就是代价，也是证明。”这是他在一九五二年六月在朝鲜前线坦克山上击退敌人进攻时负的伤，他流血了，但是敌人的进攻被打退了。现在朝鲜每一寸自由土地，都是用同样重大的代价换来的。想到和平总算初步到来了，想到自己的血并没有白流，罗时鼎带着自豪地神情说：“这说明了帝国主义想用武力压服朝鲜人民是不可能的。”停了一下他又说：“可是看起来美国好战分子和李承晚反动集团似乎还没有得到教训。我们就应该记住金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员的命令，一定要提高警惕。”
    说到提高警惕，伤口至今未愈的志愿军陈良大显得特别激动，他想起了停战谈判中在开城执行警卫任务而被美国鬼子枪杀的姚庆祥排长，他又想起了停战谈判中在板门店被美国鬼子炸死的那个朝鲜儿童。开城、板门店都是中立区，是经过双方协议建立的呀！可是，美国鬼子却一边达成协议，一边又破坏协议。
    “是的，必须提高警惕。”陈良大得出了结论：“我们不能忘记姚庆祥烈士和那个朝鲜儿童的血，停战协定签字，我们自然高兴，可是他们会不会再来破坏这个协定？我们必须盯着他们。”
    加紧生产，加强和平的力量
    在机器的轰鸣声中，停战协定签字的消息传到了石景山发电厂。老工人赵润清立刻想到被战火蹂躏得残破不堪的朝鲜，现在该要开始恢复和重建了，一种国际主义的责任感在打动着他，他说：“我有一个愿望，我准备像苏联同志帮助我们建设一样，去帮助朝鲜人民恢复他们的城市和工厂”。这个老工人提出：停战很好，为了拥护停战，我们就得加紧生产，加强保卫和平的力量。最后他自豪地谈起自己的发电厂。
    “电力，”他说：“是一切工业发展的动力，我一定要学好技术操作规程，保证北京工厂的机器一分钟也不停地运转。”
    今年曾经给志愿军写过三封信报告生产情况的石景山钢铁厂的老工人王景韶听到停战的消息后说：“钢铁在我手里，就是保卫和平的有力保障，我们要努力生产钢铁，加强国防，加强保卫和平的力量。”
    帮助朝鲜人民重建和平的家园
    “帮助朝鲜人民重建自己的家园。”这句话正在北京农业大学回响着。植物系的一个青年团小组刚结束了毕业考试，就得到朝鲜停战协定签字的消息。就在这一天，他们又第一次接到了志愿军某部“扫雷英雄”姚显儒的来信。“这是个不平凡的日子。”这些青年学生情不自禁地欢呼起来。在座谈会上，郑家蓝首先朗诵了这封信的内容：“……看到你们团小组提出来的保证，就好像听见了全国青年发出来的呼声一样。我预祝你们的胜利。”郑家蓝读完信就像宣誓似地说：“我们绝不能辜负这位英雄的期望！我们正是第一批参加祖国大规模经济建设的人们。那我们现在的任务就是要努力参加祖国建设，时刻警惕地注视着停战协定的执行情况。必要时，我们情愿去帮助朝鲜人民重建他们的家园。”
    郑家蓝的话引起了同学们的共鸣。农学系三年级俞炳骧，最近接到了在中国的朝鲜孤儿九十八封信，信上，孩子们除了报告在中国的幸福生活和表示自己的决心以外，还在信纸信封上画着金日成元帅的像、祖国的国旗、自己带着红领巾的像、彩色的和平鸽和各种各样的花朵。孩子的遭遇和感情使他深受感动，他早就下定决心将来去帮助朝鲜人民建设他们的家园。“现在，离实现我的志愿越来越近了！”他说话时，就好像已经看到了朝鲜未来的美景似的。“假若需要，”畜牧系一年级学生赵含章补充说，“我要像苏联人民帮助我们一样去帮助朝鲜人民进行建设。在那里，修建起无数牧场，养育起无数头牲畜，出产大量牛奶来抚育那些饱受战争迫害的朝鲜孩子！”
    和志愿军有着密切联系的北京师范大学附属女子中学的学生的思念却更多转向她们的亲密朋友——志愿军的身上。毕业考试成绩全班平均八十九点七、获得全校“优秀奖旗”的高三一班同学又准备给自己的志愿军朋友写信了。她们想：这些信，她们的朋友已经不是在战火弥漫的环境下接到，而是在炮火的硝烟已经消散了的平静的战线上接到了。“但是，”这一班的学生罗林说：“我们今后还要继续拿志愿军的精神来严格要求自己，努力学习和工作！”旁边，夏容插了一句：“还要告诉他们：我们也在注视着敌人如何来执行停战协定！”
    “老百姓可不比过去了”
    停战协定签字的消息传到西单区安福胡同派出所的时候，那里的居民正在行使自己的神圣的民主权利——进行基层政权的普选。在一个选举棚里的人群中，可听得见一个家庭妇女尖嗓子唱票的声音。墙上挂着几块小黑板，上面密密麻麻地写满了“正”字，一眼可以看得出王素琴得票最多。这时候，王素琴正在一家街道妇女生产小组的房子里检查着她们给志愿军缝的被窝。她脸上堆满了笑容说：“这都是我们妇女给志愿军做的，先前打算在八月中完成四千七百件，现在听到了停战的消息，劲头更足了，说不定还会提前完成哩！”很多被子的里角上，都盖着手章、写着名字，或作了其他的记号。王素琴兴奋地说：“谁都想叫志愿军知道自己的名字。人虽没到朝鲜，可是我们的心都到了……”
    一提到普选，她很快地说：“这可得感谢毛主席和志愿军啊！我们正在普选，朝鲜停战协定又签了字，大伙都说：咱们是喜上加喜呀！”接着她又严肃地说：“同志，这会咱们老百姓可不比过去了，什么事情都能批判一下。这次虽说停了战，我们都知道敌人的花招，可得好好警惕着！”
    喜悦和希望
    晚上九点钟，在朝鲜战场上，响了三年又一个多月的枪声在沉寂下去，远离祖国的志愿军战士，在庆祝自己的胜利之余该会倚着枪枝在思念亲爱的祖国、家乡和自己的亲人吧！这时候，北京海淀区军属宋老太太的院子里正热闹。小儿子和小女儿放暑假回来了，大儿子和大儿媳妇也在家休假。两对孙子，有的在凉榻上睡熟了，有的还在母亲怀里吃奶。收音机送出朝鲜停战协定签字的消息，给这一家增添了很大的欢乐。这个家庭的两个成员都在朝鲜前线——老四是志愿军空军飞行员，二姑娘在志愿军铁道部队文工团里。三姑娘拿出了哥哥、姐姐不久前从前线来的信，很有滋味地阅读着。信上说：“我们不会辜负爸爸、妈妈对我们的期望，我们会带着光荣和胜利回来见祖国和亲爱的爸爸、妈妈。这一天很快会来到。你们呢，用什么来回答祖国？”妹妹和弟弟给哥哥和姐姐的回答是：为祖国而学习，今年的总平均分数是九十三分和八十四分。最小的妹妹天真地计算着哥哥和姐姐回来的日子。看着孩子们这般快乐，母亲也露出微笑，但是她的面孔立刻又变得严肃起来，好像嘱咐自己的孩子又像解释一样：“还是要拿住枪，看住野心狼，李承晚心不死还在捣乱……”伟大的母亲的心，忍受了三年的别离，已经锻炼得更坚强了。她停了一下又说：“不是我们一家，有国才有家。”
    这里是三里河村的年轻的军属白秀珍的家。她本是一个农妇。现在，在这个村子的旁边矗立着几十座建筑架子，上万的工人在紧张的劳动，原来长满高粱的地里，将要耸立起几十座高大的国家建筑，祖国建设的明天在鼓舞着她。当国家征购了她的土地时，她怀着满腔为祖国建设服务的热情，决定到测量队去学习。现在，她正在兴奋地收拾着行李。新蓝布制服、花麻纱衬衣、花布被、新毛巾、牙膏、牙刷、肥皂散了一炕。停战消息更增加了她的愉快。她相信当朝鲜的和平彻底实现，她爱人回来的时候，她正好掌握了技术。
    “现在呢？”她回答说：“朝鲜问题还没有和平解决，我也还什么都没学会，拿什么去见他呢！”（附图片）
