Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd: Five hundred and fifty-one overseas Chinese from Japan returned to the motherland this morning via the Japanese ship "Xing'an Maru," arriving at Tanggu New Port from Japan. They arrived in Tianjin by special train that morning.

The returning overseas Chinese were warmly welcomed by the people of the motherland as soon as they entered the country. Even before the "Xing'an Maru" docked at Tanggu New Port, welcomers were already waiting at the pier. When the "Xing'an Maru" docked at Tanggu New Port, the returning overseas Chinese waved the five-star red flag on the ship and waved to the welcomers. When the returning overseas Chinese landed and passed through Tanggu Railway Station by car, more than 300 workers and students were there to welcome them. Many returning overseas Chinese were so excited that they jumped out of the car to join the welcomers in a joyous gathering. Some female students among the returning overseas Chinese enthusiastically sang songs such as "The East is Red" with the welcomers.

When the special train carrying the returning overseas Chinese arrived at Tianjin Station, Zhuang Xiquan, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, Chen Manyun, Deputy Director of the General Office, Zhou Shutao, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, heads of democratic parties and people's organizations in Tianjin, as well as more than 1,000 people from workers, students, women, and industrial and commercial circles went to welcome them. After the returning overseas Chinese got off the train, shouts of "Long live the great motherland!" and "Long live the great Chairman Mao!" and enthusiastic applause resounded throughout.

A welcome meeting for the returning overseas Chinese was held on the platform of Tianjin Station. The meeting began with a welcome speech by Zhuang Xiquan. He first expressed a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the returning overseas Chinese on behalf of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government. After describing the achievements of the people of the motherland in construction, he said: All aspects of the motherland are very concerned about overseas Chinese. Of course, those compatriots who eagerly desire to return to the country will be given warm attention. The days when you were bullied by American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries are gone forever. Finally, he encouraged the returning overseas Chinese to be citizens who love the motherland and love labor in the embrace of the motherland.

Zhou Shutao then spoke: He represented the people of Tianjin in welcoming and extending condolences to the returning overseas Chinese, and congratulated them on their achievements and progress in various undertakings in the future.

Han Qingyu, the representative of the returning overseas Chinese from Japan, delivered a speech amidst warm applause. He said: As we take our first step into the motherland, we see the motherland being built into a new country under the leadership of the People's Government and the great Chairman Mao. We, the returning overseas Chinese, will certainly join the people of the motherland in participating in the construction of the motherland. Finally, he enthusiastically shouted: "Long live the people of the motherland!" "Long live the wise Chairman Mao!"

After the welcome meeting, the returning overseas Chinese went to the guesthouse to rest.

This group of overseas Chinese from Japan, who eagerly desired to return to the motherland, had been subjected to various obstructions by the US-Japanese reactionaries before returning to the country, but with the support of the overseas Chinese in Japan and the peace-loving people of Japan, they finally overcame numerous difficulties and returned to the motherland. When they set foot on the soil of the motherland, they felt extremely excited. Wen Shikun, a student who had been away from the motherland for twelve years, said: "Coming back this time, I feel that everything is very new. Seeing that everything in the motherland is progressing by leaps and bounds, I am really happy beyond words!" Middle school student Hu Shijie said excitedly: "Last night, the ship entered the port, but before it docked, we couldn't wait to step onto the land of the motherland!" (Attached picture)

    旅日华侨五百五十一人回到祖国
    【新华社天津二日电】旅日华侨五百五十一名乘日本轮船“兴安丸”在二日晨从日本抵达塘沽新港，返归祖国。他们并在当天上午乘专车到达天津。
    回国华侨一进国门，就受到祖国人民的热烈欢迎。在“兴安丸”还在塘沽新港靠岸以前，欢迎者已经等候在码头上。当“兴安丸”在塘沽新港靠岸以后，回国华侨就在船上挥动着五星国旗，和欢迎者互相挥手致意。回国华侨登陆乘车途经塘沽车站时，有三百多名工人和学生在那里欢迎他们。好些回国华侨都兴奋得跳下车来，与欢迎者联欢。回国华侨中的一些女学生，热情地和欢迎的人们合唱“东方红”等歌。
    载着回国华侨的专车开抵天津站时，中央人民政府华侨事务委员会副主任委员庄希泉、办公厅副主任陈曼云，天津市人民政府副市长周叔韬，天津市各民主党派、人民团体负责人，以及工人、学生、妇女、工商界人士等一千多人前往欢迎。回国华侨下车后，“伟大祖国万岁！”“伟大的毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声和热烈的掌声响成一片。
    在天津站的月台上举行了欢迎回国华侨大会。大会首由庄希泉致欢迎词。他首先代表中央人民政府华侨事务委员会向回国华侨表示热烈欢迎和亲切的慰问。他在叙述了祖国人民建设的成就后说：祖国各方面对国外华侨是非常关心的。对于热望回国的侨胞们，当然要加以热烈的关切。诸位受美帝国主义和日本反动派欺负的日子是永远过去了。最后他勉励回国华侨在祖国的怀抱中作一个爱护祖国、热爱劳动的公民。
    继由周叔韬讲话：他代表天津市人民向回国华侨表示欢迎和慰问，并祝贺他们在今后从事各种事业上的成就和进步。
    回国旅日华侨代表韩庆愈在热烈掌声中致词。他说：我们在走进祖国的第一步中，看见祖国在人民政府和伟大的毛主席领导下建成新的国家。我们回国华侨一定和祖国人民一起参加祖国建设。最后，他热情高呼：“祖国人民万岁！”“英明的毛主席万岁！”
    欢迎会结束后，回国华侨即到招待所休息。
    这一批热望回到祖国的旅日华侨在回国前，曾受到美日反动派的多方阻挠，但在旅日华侨和日本爱好和平人民的支援下，终于战胜重重困难回到祖国。当他们踏上祖国的土地时，感到异常兴奋。已离开祖国十二年的留学生温世琨说：“这次回来，觉得什么都很新鲜，看到祖国一切都在飞跃进步，真使我高兴得说不出话来！”中学生胡世杰兴奋地说：“昨天晚上船进了港口，还没靠岸，我们恨不得一步跨到祖国的土地上来！”（附图片）
