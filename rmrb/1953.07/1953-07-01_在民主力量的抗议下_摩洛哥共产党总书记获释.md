Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 30th: After being imprisoned for over nine months by French and French colonial judicial authorities, the General Secretary of the Moroccan Communist Party, Ali Yata, was released on the evening of the 25th from Fresnes Prison, where he was warmly welcomed by Moroccan students residing in Paris and representatives from the French Communist Party, the French Republican Youth League, and other democratic organizations. Parisian democratic newspapers pointed out that Ali Yata's release is a great victory for democratic forces, primarily the Moroccan people and the French working class.

Ali Yata was arrested and imprisoned in September 1952. Judge Michel of the Paris Military Tribunal's investigative court insisted that he had committed the crime of "endangering the external security of the state." The Paris Military Tribunal authorities repeatedly rejected Ali Yata's applications for release. On April 22nd, Michel further decided that Ali Yata could only be released upon payment of a one million franc bail. Following protests from democratic circles and Ali Yata's defense lawyers, the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation reviewed Ali Yata's case, acknowledged that Michel's decision was illegal, and sent it back to the investigative court of the Paris Court of Appeal for retrial. The investigative court of the Paris Court of Appeal finally decided on June 25th to temporarily release Ali Yata.

    在民主力量的抗议下
    摩洛哥共产党总书记获释
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：摩洛哥共产党总书记阿里·雅塔被法国及法国殖民地司法当局囚禁了九个多月之后，于二十五日晚在侨居巴黎的摩洛哥学生和法国共产党、法兰西共和青年联盟及其他民主组织的代表的热烈欢迎下，走出了费雷纳监狱。巴黎各民主报纸指出：阿里·雅塔的获得释放，是民主力量，首先是摩洛哥人民和法国工人阶级的巨大胜利。
    阿里·雅塔是在一九五二年九月被捕下狱的。巴黎军事法庭侦察庭法官密歇尔硬说他犯了“危害国家外部安全”罪。巴黎军事法庭当局不止一次拒绝了阿里·雅塔要求释放他的申请。密歇尔在四月二十二日又决定，只有交出一百万法郎保释金，阿里·雅塔才可以得到释放。在民主阶层和阿里·雅塔的辩护律师的抗议下，大理院刑事庭审查了阿里·雅塔的案件，承认密歇尔的决定非法，发回巴黎上诉法院侦察庭重审。巴黎上诉法院侦察庭终于在六月二十五日决定暂时释放阿里·雅塔。
