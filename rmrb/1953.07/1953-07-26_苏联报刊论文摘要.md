    Party Workers are Political Leaders

    The "Pravda" published an editorial on July 4th, pointing out that party workers should be political leaders. The following is an abstract:

    The high responsibility for completing the tasks of economic and cultural construction should be borne by party cadres. The Party Committee, as an organ of political leadership, should be responsible for mobilizing the masses to realize the historic resolutions of the 19th National Congress of the Party. The Party Committee should ensure their unified action in the struggle to complete state plans and tasks.

    Therefore, the requirements for Party leaders and Party workers are particularly high. They should deeply study the problems in the development of industry and agriculture, study ideological work, and master correct methods of Party leadership. The primary responsibility of every leader is to consistently proceed from the interests of the Party and the state in all aspects, place these interests above everything else, and subordinate every step of their practical activities to these interests.

    Party leaders should become examples of creatively mastering Marxism-Leninism. Learning should never lag behind. No matter how heavy the workload, how high the position, or what the circumstances, these should not become obstacles to enriching knowledge.

    Party leaders should delve deeper into production technology and economics, understand everyone, and promptly discern everything new in the initiatives of the masses. One cannot lead a city without knowing industry, having only a vague concept of the mechanization, electrification, and automation of the production process, and lacking a clear understanding of methods for improving labor productivity, product quality, and reducing costs. One cannot lead the countryside without knowing agriculture, having an unclear understanding of the mechanization of agricultural and animal husbandry work, mastering correct seed selection methods, and creating various problems for feed stations. Party workers should be good at discovering and using the potential hidden within our national economy.

    While Party workers are assiduously studying production technology and economics, they should note that this is not an end in itself. What is important is that the knowledge they acquire helps to improve the leadership of the economy and successfully complete state plans and tasks. Party workers should deeply delve into production technology and economics, but should not become narrow, one-sided experts, but should be political leaders with prestige, capable of seeing the connection between every specific fact and the Party's policy.

    One of the most important conditions for correct leadership is the constant interaction of Party workers with the broad masses of working people. Leaders should not only teach the working people, but also learn from them. It is the responsibility of all Party workers to listen sensitively to the voice of the masses, listen to their advice and suggestions, carry out self-criticism, especially criticism from below, and should open fire on complacency, self-satisfaction, arrogance, bureaucracy, and corruption.

    The committee system in work is the highest principle of Party leadership.

    The broader the horizons of Party workers, the higher their level of knowledge, the more correct the Party's leadership will be, and the more remarkable its achievements will be.

    Strive for Concrete and Vivid Leadership

        "Pravda" published an editorial on July 16th, discussing the improvement of Party leadership methods. The following is an abstract:

    Experience proves that leadership based on profound knowledge of life, familiarity with the work situation in Party organizations, enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, state farms, and institutions, as well as the direct contact of Party leaders with Party and non-Party working people, is the most effective and vivid leadership. Establishing a vivid connection with Party organizations can help Party committees conduct leadership more concretely and purposefully, achieve better results in work, and, with the participation of the broad masses of Party members, directly organize the implementation of decisions on the spot.

    The preciousness of vivid leadership lies in its ability to help eliminate and prevent shortcomings in a timely manner, help correctly select, educate, and comprehensively examine cadres, and strengthen Party supervision. Any worker, regardless of their position, should always be under the unremitting supervision of the Party. Party organizations must regularly check the activities of all organizations and institutions and all leading workers. Leaving the supervision of the Party will lead to the failure of work and the corruption of workers. The wisdom of leadership lies in being able to see bad phenomena in their infancy and not allowing them to develop. It is necessary to resolutely expose and stop even the slightest violations of Party and state discipline, of the leadership principles formulated by the Party, and of the norms of Party life, to fight against arrogance and the idea of seeking promotion and wealth, complacency and the concept of peace, and to raise vigilance.

    Facts have proven that many Party committees have increasingly consolidated their vivid connections with Party organizations and Party members in improving their leadership methods, and have achieved great practical results on this basis. However, it must be pointed out that some Party committees still underestimate the significance of vivid leadership and replace it with countless meetings and endless instructions. Individual Party leaders prefer to sit in their offices and stay away from various places for a long time. Occasionally, such leaders may also be encountered in backward areas and collective farms, and in backward enterprises.

    Personally familiarizing oneself with the work situation on the ground and talking with people can help you understand life better than anything else. One cannot see anything from the window of an office. The dry language in reports and record books cannot express the full diversity of life. If any worker stays in the Party committee office for a long time, unwilling to go to various places, then there can be no other explanation than to regard him as being isolated from the masses, despising mass organizational work, being arrogant and bureaucratic. In order to lead correctly, it is necessary to go deeper into the masses, be good at discovering and summarizing all new and advanced things created by the initiative of the masses. Vivid contact with the masses, profound knowledge of life, and strict adherence to the principle of collectivity in work are the guarantees of the Party's correct leadership.

    Establishing a real and vivid connection with various Party organizations has nothing in common with false and superficial connections. There have been such facts that some Party workers, when they arrive in various districts, only record some individual shortcomings without delving into the work of the Party organization, without checking the implementation of resolutions, and without consulting with the local practical workers, work experts, Party activists, and ordinary Communist Party members.

    Fully consolidating the vivid connections of the Party committee with various Party organizations, Party members, and the broad masses of working people is a necessary condition for improving the level of Party leadership and achieving new achievements in economic and cultural construction.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    党的工作人员是政治的领导者
    “真理报”七月四日发表社论，指出党的工作人员应当是政治的领导者，摘要如下：
    完成经济和文化建设的任务的高度责任，应当由党员干部担负起来。党委会是政治领导的机关，应当负责发动群众去实现党的第十九次代表大会的历史性决议，党委会应当保证他们在争取完成国家计划和任务斗争中步调的一致。
    因此，对党的领导者，党的工作人员的要求特别多。他们应当深刻地研究工业和农业发展中的问题，研究思想工作，掌握正确的党的领导方法。每个领导者的首要责任，就是在各方面始终从党和国家的利益出发，把这些利益放在一切之上，使自己实际活动的每一步都服从这些利益。
    党的领导者应当成为创造性地掌握马克思列宁主义的榜样。无论何时，学习都不能落后。无论多么重工作、职位如何、处境怎样，都不应当成为充实知识的障碍。
    党的领导者应当更深入地钻研生产技术和经济，了解每个人，及时地看出群众创议中的一切新事物。不知道工业，对生产过程的机械化、电气化和自动化只有模糊的概念，对提高劳动生产率、提高产品质量和降低成本的方法缺乏明确的概念，是不能够领导城市的。不知道农业，对农业和畜牧等工作的机械化、掌握正确的选种方法、创造饲料站的各种问题认识不清，就不能领导农村。党的工作人员应当善于发现和使用我们国民经济内部蕴藏的潜力。
    党的工作人员在顽强地学习生产技术和经济时，应当注意这并不是目的的本身。重要的是要使他们所获得的知识有助于改善对经济的领导，顺利地完成国家的计划和任务。党的工作人员应当深刻钻研生产技术和经济，但不能变成一个狭仄的，单方面的专家，而应当是富有威望的政治领导者，能够看出每个具体事实和党的政策的联系。
    正确领导的最重要条件之一，就是党的工作人员与广大的劳动群众的经常的交往。领导者不仅应当教导劳动人民，而且要向他们学习。一切党的工作人员的责任就是敏感地倾听群众的声音，听取他们的劝告和建议，开展自我批评，尤其是自下而上的批评，并应向沾沾自喜，自安，骄傲自满，官僚主义和腐朽堕落开火。
    工作中的委员制就是党领导的最高原则。
    党的工作人员的眼界愈广，他的知识水平愈高，党的领导就愈正确，其成绩就愈显著。
    争取具体的和生动的领导
        “真理报”七月十六日发表了论述改善党的领导方
    法的社论，摘要如下：
    经验证明，以深刻的生活知识，以对党组织、企业、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场和机关中工作情况的熟悉了解，以及党的领导者同党及非党劳动人民的直接接触为基础的领导，是一种最有实效的生动的领导。同党组织建立生动的联系，可以帮助党委会更加具体地和有目标地进行领导，在工作中取得更好的成果，并在广大党员群众的参加下，直接就地组织对决定的执行。
    生动的领导的珍贵处在于它可以帮助及时地消灭和防止缺点，帮助正确地选拔、教育和全面考察干部，并加强党的监督。任何工作人员，不论他的职位如何，都应经常处于党的不懈的监督之下。党组织必须定期检查所有组织和机关及所有领导工作人员的活动。离开党的监督就会导致工作的失败和工作人员的腐化。领导的英明就在善于看出萌芽中的不良现象，并不使它获得发展。必须坚决地揭发和制止一切对党和国家的纪律，对党所制订的领导原则和党的生活准则的最微小的破坏，向自高自大和升官发财思想，沾沾自喜和太平观念进行斗争，并提高警惕。
    事实证明，很多党委会在改善自己的领导方法中，愈益巩固同党组织和党员的生动联系，并在这一基础上获得了巨大实际成果。但是必须指出，有些党委会对生动领导的意义还估计不足，而用无数的会议和源源不断的指令来代替这种领导。个别党的领导人宁愿坐在办公室里，长期不到各地。在落后地区和集体农庄中，在落后的企业中，偶而也可能遇到这种领导人。
    亲自熟识当地的工作情况，同人们交谈，这比任何东西都更能使你摸清生活。一个人从办公室的窗口是望不到什么的。报告记录簿上的干燥的语言是不能表达全部生活的多种多样性的。任何工作人员在党委办公室长期呆坐，不愿到各地去，那么除了把他看作是同群众隔绝，轻视群众组织工作，自高自大和官僚主义外，再不能有其他解释。为要正确的领导，就必须更深入群众，善于发现和总结一切新的、先进的、由群众的主动精神所创造的事物。同群众的生动的接触，深刻的生活知识，在工作中严格遵守集体原则，这就是党的正确的领导的保证。
    同各个党组织建立真正的、生动的联系，是和虚伪的、装装样子的联系，没有任何共同之处的。曾有这样的事实，一些党的工作人员到了各区，仅是记下一些个别缺点，而不深入到党组织的工作中去，不去检查决议的执行情况，不向该地实际工作者、工作能手、党的积极分子和一般共产党员去请教。
    全力巩固党委会同各个党组织、党员和广大劳动人民的生动的联系，就是提高党的领导水平，在经济和文化建设中取得新的成绩的必要条件。
