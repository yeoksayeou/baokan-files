Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong Front, July 27th: Our correspondent reports on the ceasefire scene on the Kaesong front after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement: At 22:00 (Korean time) on the evening of July 27, 1953, the hands of the luminous watch pointed precisely to the hour, marking the arrival of a historically significant moment—the complete ceasefire on the Korean front. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Kaesong Front Command, in accordance with the ceasefire order from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai, ordered all infantry, artillery, tank, and anti-aircraft artillery units of our army on the Kaesong front to cease fire through the battlefield telephone network. Our artillery fire ceased. The loudspeakers on our army's positions along the Sajawon River and Daedeok Mountain line on both sides of the Panmunjom Neutral Zone broadcasted the welcome news to the enemy soldiers: "Ceasefire!" The sound of cannons ceased, the sound of gunfire ceased, and the Korean War, which had lasted for three years and thirty-three days, came to a halt. The battlefield, which had been filled with the din of war just moments before, now saw the smoke and the smell of gunpowder gradually dissipate into the cool summer night breeze.

The glorious defenders of Kaesong—outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people from both sides of the Yangtze River, the North China Plain, and the foothills of the Helan Mountains—were at this moment gratified by the achievement of the Korean War ceasefire, while also vigilantly watching the movements on the front line after the ceasefire. From the U.S. and Rhee army positions, a series of noises and wild laughter broke through the silent night sky. Under the moonlight, one could vaguely see the U.S. and Rhee soldiers crawling out of their muddy and filthy bunkers, desperately shouting, jumping, and singing. They were relieved that they had not become the final victims of this war.

Looking back north from our army's forward positions on the north bank of the Han River, Songak Mountain stood far behind Kaesong. Three years ago, the Syngman Rhee clique, at the instigation of U.S. imperialism, fired the first shot of their "Northern Expedition" war of aggression against the People's North Korea on this mountain. However, today Songak Mountain remains far to the north of the ceasefire line. The current ceasefire line has been pushed south by more than 330 square kilometers compared to the line guarded by our army two years ago. Songak Mountain has become a monument to historical lessons, marking the failure of the warmongers who attempted to "unify" Korea by military force.

    开城前线停火情景
    【新华社开城前线二十七日电】本社记者报道朝鲜停战协定签字后开城前线停火的情景说：一九五三年七月二十七日晚间，夜光表的指针正指在二十二时（朝鲜时间）上，具有历史意义的时刻——朝鲜战线全线停火的时刻来到了。中国人民志愿军开城前线指挥部，遵照金日成元帅、彭德怀将军的停战命令，通过战地电话网，命令开城前线我军的步兵、炮兵、坦克部队和高射炮兵部队全部停火。我方的炮火停止了射击。在板门店中立区两侧的砂川河和大德山一线我军阵地上的扩音器，向敌军士兵播出了为他们所欢迎的消息：“停火了”。炮声停止了，枪声停止了，继续了三年零三十三天的朝鲜战争至此停火了。顷刻前还是战火纷飞的战线，现在，弥漫空中的硝烟与火药气息，逐渐消失在夏夜的凉风中。
    光荣的开城保卫者——来自长江两岸、华北平原以及贺兰山麓的中国人民优秀儿女们，在这时都为争取到朝鲜战争停战的实现而欣慰，同时警惕地注视着停火后的战线上的动静。从美、李军阵地上，传来一阵阵吵嚷和狂笑的声音，冲破静寂的夜空。月光下隐约可以看见，美、李军的士兵们从泥泞污秽的地堡里钻出来，拚命地喊叫着、跳着、唱着。他们庆幸自己还没有成为这个战争中的最后的牺牲者。
    记者从汉江北岸我军前沿阵地上回首北望，松岳山远远地矗立在开城背后。三年前，李承晚集团在美帝国主义的唆使下，就在这个山上，向人民的北朝鲜打出了他们的“北伐”侵略战争的第一枪。可是，今天松岳山远远地留在停火线的北方了。现在的这条停火线，比起两年前我军所守卫的战线，向南推进了三百三十多平方公里。松岳山成了历史教训的纪念碑，它标志着企图以军事力量来“统一”朝鲜的黩武主义者的失败。
