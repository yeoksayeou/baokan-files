    Northeast Region Deploys Prevention and Control of Sorghum Aphids
    Currently, the Northeast is actively deploying work to prevent and control sorghum aphids. Sorghum is one of the main crops in the Northeast and a major food source for the people of the Northeast. Sorghum aphids occur over a large area in the Northeast and pose a devastating hazard to sorghum. After mid-July last year, such pests occurred successively in Liaoxi, Liaodong, Jilin and other provinces. According to statistics, in these three provinces, about 857,700 hectares of sorghum in 43 counties suffered yield reductions of 30% due to aphid damage. In the most severely affected areas, such as certain areas of Lishu and Changbei counties in northern Liaoxi, there was even no harvest at all.
    In order to prevent and control this pest as early as possible, the Northeast Administrative Committee's Agricultural Bureau held a special training class on the prevention and control of sorghum and soybean aphids in mid-May this year. Seventy-six people from provincial agricultural departments, experimental farms, and key demonstration farms participated in the training. At the same time, a sorghum and soybean aphid prevention and control information network was established. This information network is centered on the Agricultural Bureau and the Northeast Agricultural Science Institute and is distributed in 30 key counties in six provinces.
    This year, the methods for eliminating sorghum aphids in the Northeast, in addition to the use of medicines and machinery in key areas, such as spraying "666," rotenone, and cotton oil soap solutions, most areas still use the methods commonly used by the masses, such as removing bottom leaves and sweeping and dragging with brooms.
    In addition, the Northeast Agricultural Science Institute and the Jilin, Liaoxi, and Heilongjiang agricultural experiment stations have formed an investigation and research group, preparing to find better prevention and control methods through investigating and studying the living habits and occurrence and development patterns of this pest.

    东北区布置防治高粱蚜虫
    目前，东北正积极布置防治高粱蚜虫的工作。高粱是东北主要农作物之一，又是东北人民的主要食粮。高粱蚜虫在东北发生的面积大，对高粱带有毁灭性的危害。去年七月中旬以后，辽西、辽东、吉林等省都先后发生了这种害虫。据统计，这三个省有四十三个县约有八十五万七千七百多公顷高粱因蚜虫为害而减产三成。为害最严重的地区如辽西北部梨树、昌北等县的若干地区甚至颗粒不收。
    东北行政委员会农业局为了及早防治这种害虫，曾在今年五月中旬举办了防治高粱大豆蚜虫专题训练班。参加训练的有各省农业厅、试验场和重点示范场的人员七十六人。同时举办并建立了高粱、大豆蚜虫防治情报网。这种情报网以农业局和东北农业科学研究所为中心，分布地区有六个省三十个重点县。
    今年东北除治高粱蚜虫的办法，除在重点地区使用药械，如喷布“六六六”、鱼藤精和棉油皂等水剂外，大部地区还是用群众惯用的打底叶和扫帚扫、拖等方法。
    此外，东北农业科学研究所和吉林、辽西、黑龙江三个农业试验场合组了一个调查研究组，准备通过对这种害虫的生活习性、发生发展规律的调查研究，找出更好的防治方法。
