Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Tokyo news: The Japanese people's movement against US military bases is surging across Japan.

The people in the Osaka area are fighting against the expansion of the Itami military base. In order to expand the supply base centered on Itami base, the US military is preparing to forcibly expand Itami Airport and the Hirakata Ammunition Factory, take over the Shitajiyama Training Ground, and establish brothels for the US military in Fuse, Ibaraki and other cities. People from all walks of life in Ibaraki, Fuse, Toyonaka, Ikeda and other cities in Osaka Prefecture, and surrounding towns and villages of Shitajiyama, unanimously and strongly oppose this plan. Centered on the Osaka Prefectural Teachers' Union and women's groups, they have formed a united front, including the mayors, to carry out the struggle. The people of Ibaraki and Fuse cities are particularly fierce in their struggle against the establishment of US military brothels. They are preparing to form a joint struggle organization.

In Nagoya, another famous city in Japan, more than 7,000 workers from the Nagoya Regional Council of the Japan Seamen's Union are calling on local trade union organizations, democratic groups, and prefectural and municipal assembly members to launch a struggle against the US military's plan to build an ammunition depot at Nagoya's No. 10 pier.

Measures taken by the US military to forcibly establish training grounds are being countered everywhere. In May, the US military authorities suddenly announced the use of the former Japanese Army training ground in Nihonbara, Katsuta County, Okayama Prefecture, and designated the area as a restricted zone. As a result, the livelihoods of at least 1,000 farmers were disrupted. The struggle against the takeover of Nihonbara quickly unfolded, and the Okayama Prefectural General Council of Trade Unions organized a joint struggle committee against the takeover of Nihonbara on May 25. Under the influence of the people of the entire prefecture, the Okayama Prefectural Assembly and the Prefectural Governor also decided to oppose the establishment of a US military training ground in Nihonbara.

In Yamagata Prefecture, on June 29, more than 2,000 farmers from Tozawa Village and neighboring areas protested to the US-Japan Joint Committee investigation team, firmly demanding the abolition of the Ohtakane shooting range in Tozawa Village.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: Tokyo news: The July issue of the Japanese magazine "New World" published an article titled "The Tyranny of the US Military" written by a Japanese worker employed at the Itami US military base, accusing the US military of oppression and abuse of Japanese workers.

The author talked about the discrimination suffered by Japanese people on the military base, saying: Inside the base, "the US military has very elaborate restaurants, bars, and clubs. But thousands of Japanese workers don't even have a cafeteria. When the weather is good, everyone eats in the open air; in rainy weather and winter, they have to hide in corners or next to tools to eat cold meals, and they can't even get hot water." Moreover, in a large base with so many Japanese workers, "only four toilets are designated for Japanese use," and "if they use other nearby toilets, they will be insulted by the US military."

Japanese people working on US military bases also have their private lives subjected to the overbearing restrictions of the US military. The author wrote: If "Japanese male and female workers fall in love, according to US military regulations, the man is fired and the woman is kept. Japanese people cannot even fall in love on the base."

Not only that, the US military authorities can arbitrarily dismiss Japanese workers, using this as a threat to make workers obey their arbitrary orders. The author said: "What makes the Japanese employed by the occupation forces most uneasy and indignant is that the US military has the right to dismiss." Workers "cannot object to 'military order dismissals' and 'security dismissals'... arbitrary dismissals without any reason occur at any time." Moreover, "there is no provision for severance pay when dismissed." The author gave an example: "Last spring, a very conscientious Japanese worker fell ill, and the doctor gave him a certificate for two weeks of recuperation. But he got better on the tenth day, so he went to work. But the American said: 'You could have recovered in ten days, but you submitted a certificate for two weeks of recuperation, you are faking illness! Go home.' That worker was dismissed like that."

    日本人民反对美国军事基地运动广泛开展
    美军基地的日本雇工遭受种种压迫和虐待
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：日本人民反对美国军事基地的运动，正在日本全国各地风起云涌。
    大阪地区的人民，正在进行着反对扩大伊丹军事基地的斗争。美军为了扩大以伊丹基地为中心的补给基地，准备强制扩充伊丹飞机场和枚方火药厂，并接收信太山演习场，以及在布施、茨木等市给美军设立妓女营。大阪府茨木、布施、丰中、池田等市和信太山周围的镇、村等广大阶层人民，一致强烈反对这个计划。他们以大阪府教职员工会和妇女团体等为中心，组成了包括市长在内的统一战线，进行着斗争。茨木、布施两市人民反对设立美军妓女营的斗争尤其激烈。他们正在准备组成一个联合斗争的组织。
    在日本的另外一个著名的都市名古屋，日本海运产业工会名古屋地区协议会的七千多名工人，正在号召当地各工会组织、民主团体以及县、市议会议员等，对美军准备在名古屋第十号码头建设火药库一事，展开斗争。
    美军强制设立演习场的措施，到处受到反击。五月间，美军当局突然宣布使用冈山县胜田郡日本原的前日本陆军演习场，并把该地划为禁区。这样一来，至少破坏了一千户农民的生活。反对接收日本原的斗争迅速展开，冈山县工会总评议会在五月二十五日，组织了反对接收日本原的联合斗争委员会。冈山县的县议会和县知事，也在全县人民的影响下，决定反对在日本原建立美军演习场。
    在山形县，六月二十九日，户泽村和邻区的二千多农民向美日联合委员会调查团提出抗议，坚决要求撤销户泽村大高根射击场。
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息：七月号的日本“新世界”杂志发表了一个在伊丹美国军事基地上作雇工的日本工人写的一篇题为“美军的横暴”的文章，控诉美军对日本工人的压迫和虐待。
    作者谈到军事基地上的日本人所受到的歧视说：在基地里，“美军有很讲究的餐厅、酒吧间和俱乐部。可是成千的日本工人，却连食堂都没有。天气好时，大家在露天吃饭；在雨天和冬季里，就只好躲在墙角或工具旁边吃冷饭，连开水都喝不到”。并且，在有这样多日本工人的大基地里，“限定日本人可用的厕所只有四个”，“如果使用临近的其他厕所，就要遭到美军的辱骂”。
    在美国军事基地上做工的日本人，连私生活也遭到美军的蛮横限制。作者写道：如果“日本男女工人发生恋爱，按照美军的规定，把男的解雇，把女的留下。日本人在基地里连恋爱都不可能”。
    不仅如此，美军当局还可以随意解雇日本工人，以此来威胁工人听从他们任意驱使。作者说：“最使给占领军作雇工的日本人不安和愤慨的是美军有解雇权”。工人们“不能反对‘军令解雇’和‘保安解雇’……毫无理由被任意解雇的事情随时都在发生”。而且“在被解雇时，没有退职金的规定。”作者举了一个例子说：“去年春，一个极认真的日本工人害了病，医生给他开了一张休养两星期的证明书。但他在第十天病就好了，所以去上班。可是美国人说：‘你本来十天就可以好的病，但是你交了一张休养两星期的证明书，是装病吧！你回家去吧。’那个工人就这样被解雇了。”
