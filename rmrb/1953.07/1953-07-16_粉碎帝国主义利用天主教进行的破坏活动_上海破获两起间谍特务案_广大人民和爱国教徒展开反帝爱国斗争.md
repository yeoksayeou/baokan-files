    Smash Imperialist Sabotage Activities Using Catholicism
    Shanghai Uncovers Two Espionage Cases
    Broad Masses and Patriotic Religious Followers Launch Anti-Imperialist Patriotic Struggle
    [This newspaper reports] The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, after a long and meticulous investigation, successively uncovered two espionage cases on March 25th and June 15th involving imperialists using Catholicism to carry out sabotage activities, arresting over twenty principal and accessory offenders. After detailed interrogation, the evidence was conclusive, and all the criminals were unable to deny their guilt. The Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will punish them according to the severity of their crimes. People and patriotic Catholics in Shanghai and many cities in East China have expressed great indignation at this despicable and malicious criminal behavior of the imperialists. They unanimously support the just measures taken by the People's Government and are determined to continue assisting the government in thoroughly crushing the imperialist espionage activities that endanger the interests of the Chinese people and defile the Catholic Church.
    Those arrested on March 25th included principal offenders Alain De Terwangne (Catholic priest, Belgian) and Clement Renirkens (Belgian), and eight accessory offenders. Both 田望霖 Tian Wanglin and 林仁 Lin Ren were imperialist spies and secret agents masquerading as Catholic priests. 田望霖 Tian Wanglin came to Shanghai in 1948 and was originally a confidant of the imperialist element, 里培里 Libeili. When 里培里 Libeili was controlling the Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference to carry out reactionary activities in China, he appointed 田望霖 Tian Wanglin as the group leader. When 里培里 Libeili was expelled from China, he left him two thousand US dollars for operating expenses. Last year, 里培里 Libeili also secretly sent him "instructions." Shortly after the liberation of Shanghai, 田 Tian took over the criminal activities of 裁尔孟 Cai'ermen, an imperialist spy who had been expelled from our country, colluding with 林仁 Lin Ren, and hiding in the Shanghai office of the Catholic Haimen Diocese. From September 1951 until the case was uncovered, they engaged in espionage activities for a long time. 田 Tian and 林 Lin frequently spied on China's political, economic, and military secrets, compiled them into intelligence, and sent them to foreign imperialist intelligence agencies using various codes and secret writings, totaling thirty copies, named "MEMENTO." The sources of intelligence were diverse. In April 1952, 田 Tian sent 师保禄 Shi Baolu, an accessory offender in this case, to Baoding City, Hebei Province, under the guise of opening a factory, to collect intelligence. 师保禄 Shi Baolu was one of their most valued henchmen. In Baoding, 师 Shi colluded with the imperialist element 平静修 Ping Jingxiu (who has been expelled from the country) and several members of the Legion of Mary to carry out reactionary activities. 田 Tian and 林 Lin also used despicable means such as monetary inducements to deceive and entice young religious believers to spy on intelligence and spread rumors. 林仁 Lin Ren gave 吴宝昌 Wu Baochang, a student believer at 向明中学 Xiangming Middle School, 240,000 yuan to spy on intelligence, even asking him to "prepare to go to jail and be a martyr for the faith." 田 Tian and 林 Lin knew their crimes were serious and acted extremely secretively on weekdays. They set up a "small chapel" in their residence to cover up their criminal activities, and made preparations in advance, in case of being caught, for someone to take over their sabotage work. 田 Tian gave 林鸣奎 Lin Mingkui, an accessory offender in this case, two thousand US dollars, a code dictionary, and foreign contact addresses, and instructed him to continue espionage activities after the case was uncovered. 田 Tian and 林 Lin also listed 师保禄 Shi Baolu as one of the "successors." 田望霖 Tian Wanglin told 师保禄 Shi Baolu the address of the foreign intelligence station, asking 师 Shi to "continue reporting after they leave the country," and instructed 师 Shi to "persist and wait for the US-Chiang counter-offensive." The Shanghai Public Security Bureau, based on long-term investigation and reports from the masses, proved that all the materials were true, and cracked the case in one fell swoop on March 25th. The alarm bells, warning lights, and multiple locks set up by 田 Tian all proved ineffective. Public security personnel found on the spot the evidence of this group of spies and secret agents: the draft of the 30th intelligence report, a large amount of US dollars, codebooks, chemical reagents, addresses of domestic and foreign intelligence networks, and correspondence, etc.
    Following the uncovering of the 田望霖 Tian Wanglin and 林仁 Lin Ren espionage case, on June 15th, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau uncovered another case of imperialist espionage under the guise of religion, arresting thirteen espionage and secret agent elements including 翟光华 Zhai Guanghua (Charles Joseph McCarthy, American, President of the Jesuit Seminary), 斐有文 Fei Youwen (Thomes Leonard Phillips, American, priest of the Imperial Church), 葛怀仁 Ge Huai Ren (Joseph Patrick McCormack, American, Head of the Maryknoll Mission Office), 格寿平 Ge Shouping (Fernand Lacretelle, French, President of the Jesuit Society), and 梅占元 Mei Zhanyuan (Joseph Jean Deymier, French, General Supervisor of the Lazarists of the Far East). Confiscated on the spot were pistols, revolvers, Mauser pistols, hand grenades, various bullets, and destroyed radios, gun parts, the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, military maps, receivers, meteorological instruments, and a large number of intelligence materials. Also confiscated were multiple pieces of our state secret documents stolen under the instigation of these spies. The materials seized proved that this group of imperialist spies and secret agents had been engaged in evil deeds against the Chinese people for a long time. Before liberation, 梅占元 Mei Zhanyuan and others collected intelligence on the local people's guerrilla forces through imperialist elements within the Catholic Church in Zhejiang Province. After liberation, they collected intelligence on our military, political, and economic affairs. They reported to foreign intelligence agencies on the effects of Chiang Kai-shek bandit paratrooper agents and US aircraft spreading bacteria. These spies and secret agents also used churches and their residences to harbor counter-revolutionaries and fund US-Chiang agents. After the liberation of Shanghai, American spies lurking in Shanghai used the Imperial Church as a liaison point for a long time. 邓习佩 Deng Xipei (who has been arrested), the fourth battalion commander of the second detachment of the "Southeast People's Anti-Communist Salvation Army of the Su-Wan Area" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 毛森 Mao Sen system, who was hiding in Shanghai, received funding from 斐有文 Fei Youwen and others in December 1950. The counter-revolutionary criminal 范泽生 Fan Zesheng was hidden by imperialist elements in the Shoushan Church. He was arrested at the same time as 梅占元 Mei Zhanyuan this time. 范 Fan is from Beijing, a former priest in the Baoding Diocese. In 1946, he served as the secretary and propaganda officer of the Qingyuan County Party Branch of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang and a pseudo-councilor. He organized a home-returning team, instigating his henchmen to arrest our cadres and farmers, seizing grain and settling old scores. He also colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to kill our village cadre 范旦子 Fan Danzi and brutally dug out 范旦子 Fan Danzi's heart and liver. After liberation, 范 Fei fled to Shanghai, changed his name to 范保禄 Fan Baolu, and has been hidden in the Shoushan Church by 梅占元 Mei Zhanyuan and others. This group of imperialist spies and secret agents has consistently undermined the decrees of the People's Government. For example, the Imperial Church and the Lazarists concealed a large number of land deeds from Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and other places, which were not handed over during the land reform. They concealed, used, and sold radios and telecommunications equipment under aliases. Over the years, the Lazarists and the Jesuits have continuously and massively illegally obtained foreign exchange, transferred property, and hidden weapons. They have also induced and coerced young people to go abroad for reactionary training, prevented members of the Legion of Mary from registering, and undermined land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.
    After the crimes of imperialist elements using Catholicism for espionage activities were publicly exposed, they aroused the public indignation of people from all walks of life and patriotic Catholics in Shanghai. People from all walks of life and patriotic Catholics have held meetings, made accusations, issued declarations, and written letters to newspapers to expose and denounce the crimes of imperialists endangering the Chinese people, support the wise measures of the People's Government in arresting imperialist spies, and are determined to participate in the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle. More than 10,000 people from all walks of life in Xuhui District held a mass meeting on June 22. At the meeting, Catholics accused the crimes of imperialist elements. The uncovering of these two espionage cases also awakened some people with paralyzed thinking. Dr. 许曼音 Xu Manyin, a Catholic, self-critically said: "In the past, I thought that after the imperialist elements such as 里培里 Libeili and 裁尔孟 Cai'ermen were expelled, there would probably be no more people in the Catholic Church who, under the guise of religion, were secretly engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. Today, seeing the exposed cases of spies and secret agents such as 田望霖 Tian Wanglin, I am greatly alarmed." People and patriotic Catholics in Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Xuzhou and other places have also held meetings to support this just struggle. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Culture and Education Committee held an "Exhibition of Criminal Evidence of Imperialist Use of Catholicism for Conspiracy and Sabotage Activities," using material objects, pictures, and other means to thoroughly expose the enemy's crimes. Many people from all walks of life and Catholics have gone to visit the exhibition every day. As of June 25, there have been more than 50,000 visitors, and more than 1,000 groups and units with a total of 282,000 people have directly registered to request visits. Catholics from Nanjing, Haimen and other places have also sent representatives to Shanghai to visit the exhibition.
    In order to further mobilize people from all walks of life to crush the conspiracy and sabotage activities of imperialist elements using Catholicism, the Shanghai Third Session of the People's Political Consultative Conference held its third plenary (enlarged) meeting on June 25. More than 400 people attended, including 陈毅 Chen Yi, Chairman of the Shanghai People's Political Consultative Conference. At the meeting, 马敬铮 Ma Jingzheng, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, gave a detailed report on the uncovering of the above-mentioned two espionage cases. After the report, he said that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau is paying close attention to some remaining elements who are carrying out conspiracy activities. Representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations unanimously expressed their heartfelt support for the wise measures taken by the People's Government to arrest the imperialist elements lurking in Catholicism, and guaranteed to participate in the struggle to crush the conspiracy activities of imperialist elements using Catholicism with practical actions. In their speeches, many Catholics, in addition to continuing to expose some of the evil deeds of imperialist elements, also used their personal experiences to explain the facts of the People's Government protecting religious freedom, and unanimously requested the People's Government to severely punish the imperialist elements lurking within Catholicism. Chairman 陈毅 Chen Yi made an important instruction at the meeting. He pointed out that the People's Government's religious policy is clear: the freedom of religious belief of the people is resolutely guaranteed according to law, both today and in the future. However, the People's Government will resolutely strike at the sabotage activities of imperialist elements using religion. The two imperialist espionage cases recently uncovered have further exposed the conspiracy of imperialists using religion to carry out sabotage, which is another victory in the anti-imperialist struggle jointly carried out by the people of Shanghai and the Catholics. Then he pointed out: Now some imperialist elements are still spreading rumors, deceiving religious believers, and undermining the anti-imperialist patriotic activities of Catholics, which is absolutely not allowed. Chairman 陈毅 Chen Yi once again declared: The People's Government will still adopt a patient education attitude towards those religious believers who have been deceived for a long time and have not yet been able to distinguish right from wrong, although they are a minority. The People's Government hopes that they can recognize the destructive crimes committed by imperialist elements using Catholicism from the confirmed facts of this case and resolutely awaken, break away from the control of imperialist elements, and turn to the anti-imperialist patriotic movement to be patriotic religious believers. This is what the People's Government hopes for, and it is in line with the interests of the people and the interests of the religious believers themselves. The People's Government will definitely punish those who are obsessed and willingly used by imperialism according to law, and will never condone them. The meeting finally adopted a resolution to mobilize people from all walks of life to crush the conspiracy activities of imperialist elements using Catholicism. The resolution calls on all the people of Shanghai to take action and actively participate in this serious struggle; it calls on patriotic clergy and the broad masses of religious believers in Catholicism to take action, draw a clear line with the imperialist elements within the church, expose the destructive conspiracies of imperialist elements and other counter-revolutionary elements using Catholicism, and strive for the protection of the motherland and the guarantee of true religious freedom.
    At present, people from all walks of life and patriotic Catholics in Shanghai are further launching an anti-imperialist patriotic struggle in accordance with the resolutions passed by the Municipal Political Consultative Conference.

    粉碎帝国主义利用天主教进行的破坏活动
    上海破获两起间谍特务案
    广大人民和爱国教徒展开反帝爱国斗争
    【本报讯】上海市人民政府公安局经过长期周密的侦察，在三月二十五日和六月十五日，先后破获了两起帝国主义利用天主教进行破坏活动的间谍特务案，逮捕了主从犯二十余名。经过详细的审讯，由于罪证确凿，各犯均无可抵赖。中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会，将根据各犯罪情的轻重分别依法予以惩处。上海和华东许多城市的人民和爱国天主教徒，对帝国主义的这一卑鄙恶毒的犯罪行为，表示了极大的愤恨。一致拥护人民政府的严正措施，决心继续协助政府彻底粉碎帝国主义危害中国人民利益和损污天主教会的间谍特务活动。
    三月二十五日逮捕的有主犯田望霖（Alain    DeTerwangne，天主教神甫，比利时籍）、林仁（Clement    Renirkens，比利时籍）和从犯八名。田望霖和林仁都是以天主教神甫名义为掩护的帝国主义间谍特务。田望霖在一九四八年来上海，原是帝国主义分子黎培里的心腹。黎培里在中国控制天主教教务协进会进行反动活动时期，曾派田望霖为组长；黎培里被驱逐出中国国境时，留给他两千元美金作活动经费；去年黎培里还给他秘密传来“指示”。上海解放不久，田犯即接替了被驱逐出我国国境的帝国主义间谍才尔孟的罪恶活动，勾结林仁，潜伏在天主教海门教区驻上海办事处，从一九五一年九月开始到破获时止，长期进行着间谍活动。田、林两犯经常刺探我国各地政治、经济、军事各方面的机密，汇集编成情报后，用各种密码、密写发往国外帝国主义情报机关，先后共有三十份，取名为“MEMENTO”。情报的来源是多方面的。一九五二年四月，田犯曾派本案从犯师保禄赴河北省保定市，以开办工厂为名，从事搜集情报的活动。师保禄是他们最看重的爪牙之一。师犯在保定曾勾结了帝国主义分子平静修（已被逐出国境）和圣母军分子多人进行反动活动。田、林两犯并以金钱引诱等卑劣手段，欺骗和勾引青年教徒刺探情报，散布谣言。林仁曾先后给向明中学教徒学生吴宝昌二十四万元，要吴刺探情报，甚至要他“准备坐牢为主殉教”。田、林两犯自知罪行严重，平日行动极为诡秘。他们在住处布置了一个“小圣堂”，以掩护其罪恶活动；并预作布置，准备破案后，有人接替其破坏工作。田犯曾以两千美元、密码字典和国外联系地址等先后交给本案从犯林鸣奎，并嘱他在案破后继续进行间谍活动。田、林两犯把师保禄也列为“继承人”之一，田望霖把国外情报站的地址告诉师保禄，要师犯在他们“离境后继续报告”，并嘱师犯要
    “坚持下去，等待美蒋反攻”。上海市公安局根据长期的侦察与群众的检举，证明全部材料属实后，于三月二十五日一举破案。田犯所布置的警铃、警灯、重重门锁都失去效用，公安人员当场找到这批间谍特务分子的罪证：第三十号情报底稿、大量美钞、密码本、化学药水、国内外情报网地址及来往信件等等。
    继田望霖、林仁间谍特务案破获之后，六月十五日，上海市公安局又破获了另一起以宗教为掩护的帝国主义间谍特务案，间谍特务分子翟光华
    （Charles    Joseph    McCarthy，美国籍，耶稣会神学院院长）、斐有文（Thomes    Leonard    Phillips，美国籍，帝王堂神甫）、葛怀仁（Joseph    PatrickMcCormack，美国籍，玛利诺会办事处负责人）、格寿平（Fernand    Lacretelle，法国籍，耶稣会会长）、梅占元（Joseph    Jean    Deymier，法国籍，远东遣使会总视察）等十三人被逮捕。当场搜获手枪、左轮枪、盒子枪、手榴弹、各种子弹，及破坏了的电台、枪支零件，蒋匪党国旗、军事地图、收报机，气象测量计以及大批情报资料。并搜获在这些间谍分子主使下所窃取的我国家机密文件多件。根据缴获的材料证明，这批帝国主义间谍特务分子曾长期进行反对中国人民的罪恶勾当。解放前，梅占元等曾通过浙江省天主教内的帝国主义分子，搜集当地人民游击武装的情报，解放后搜集我军事、政治、经济等情报。他们曾向外国特务机关报告蒋匪空降特务及美机散布细菌后的效果。这些间谍特务分子还利用教堂及其住所，包藏反革命分子，资助美蒋特务。上海解放后，潜伏在上海的美国间谍分子即长期以帝王堂作为连络接头之所。蒋匪毛森系潜藏在上海的武装特务、匪“东南人民反共救国军苏皖区独立纵队”第二支队第四大队长邓习佩
    （已被逮捕），在一九五○年十二月就曾得到斐有文等的资助。反革命罪犯范泽生被帝国主义分子隐藏在首善堂内，此次与梅占元同时被捕。范是北京人，前保定教区神甫，一九四六年曾任蒋匪国民党清苑县党部区分部书记兼宣传委员及伪参议员。他曾组织还乡队，主使爪牙逮捕我干部及农民，抢粮倒算；又勾结蒋匪军杀死我村干部范旦子，并将范旦子的心肝挖出，残暴异常。范匪于解放后逃至上海，化名范保禄，一直被梅占元等匿藏在首善堂内。这批帝国主义间谍特务分子并一贯破坏人民政府法令。如帝王堂、遣使会匿藏大批扬州、高邮等地的田契，在土地改革时并未交出；匿藏使用并化名出卖电台及电讯器材；遣使会、耶稣会多年来曾不断地、大量地私套外汇，转移财产，隐藏武器，又曾诱骗强迫青年赴国外受反动训练，阻止圣母军分子登记，破坏土地改革及镇压反革命运动。
    帝国主义分子利用天主教进行间谍特务活动的罪行被公开揭发后，激起了全上海市各界人民与爱国天主教徒的公愤。各界人民及爱国教徒，连日纷纷集会，控诉、发表宣言、给报社写信，揭发和痛斥帝国主义危害中国人民的罪行，拥护人民政府逮捕帝国主义间谍特务的英明措施，决心参加反帝爱国斗争。徐汇区各界人民一万余人在六月二十二日举行了群众大会，会上，天主教徒们控诉了帝国主义分子的罪行。这两起间谍特务案的破获，也使一部分思想麻痹的人清醒过来。天主教徒许曼音医师自我批判说：“过去我认为驱逐了帝国主义分子黎培里、才尔孟等以后，天主教中大概不会再有披着宗教外衣暗里却作反革命勾当的人了，今天看到揭露的田望霖等间谍特务案件，使我大为警惕。”杭州、南京、无锡、嘉兴、徐州等地人民与爱国天主教徒也纷纷集会，支持这一正义的斗争。与此同时，上海市人民政府文化教育委员会举办了“帝国主义利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动罪证展览会”，用实物、图片等彻底揭发敌人的罪行。各界人民和天主教徒连日前往参观的很多，截至六月二十五日止已有五万多人，直接前往登记要求参观的已有一千多个团体单位共二十八万二千多人。南京、海门等地的天主教徒也推派代表前往上海参观。
    为了进一步动员各界人民粉碎帝国主义分子利用天主教进行阴谋破坏活动，上海市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会在六月二十五日举行了第三次全体（扩大）会议。出席的有市各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席陈毅等四百余人。会上，上海市公安局代表马敬铮把破获上述两起间谍特务案作了详细报告。他在报告之后表示：上海市公安局对于一些在进行阴谋活动的残余分子正密切予以注意。各民主党派、人民团体代表在发言中，一致表示衷心拥护人民政府逮捕潜藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子的贤明措施，并保证以实际行动来参加粉碎帝国主义利用天主教进行阴谋活动的斗争。许多天主教徒在发言中除继续揭发帝国主义分子的一些罪恶事实外，并以切身体会说明了人民政府保护宗教信仰自由的事实，一致要求人民政府严惩潜藏在天主教内部的帝国主义分子。陈毅主席在会上做了重要指示。他指出人民政府的宗教政策是明确的：对人民的宗教信仰自由是坚决依法保障的，今天是如此，将来也是如此。但对帝国主义分子利用宗教进行破坏活动则坚决地予以打击。最近破获的两起帝国主义间谍案，进一步揭露了帝国主义利用宗教进行破坏的阴谋，这是上海人民与天主教徒们共同进行的反帝斗争的又一次胜利。接着他指出：现在有些帝国主义分子还在继续散布谣言，欺骗教徒，破坏天主教徒的反帝爱国活动，这是绝对不能允许的。陈毅主席再一次声明：人民政府对那些长期被欺骗的暂时还未能分清是非的教徒，虽然是少数，但仍然采取耐心教育的态度，希望他们能从这次破案的确凿事实中认识帝国主义分子利用天主教所进行的破坏罪行而毅然决心觉悟起来，脱离帝国主义分子的掌握，转到反帝爱国运动方面作一个爱国的教徒，这是人民政府所期望的，也是符合人民利益与教徒们本身利益的；对那些执迷不悟甘心受帝国主义利用的败类，人民政府一定依法惩处，绝不姑息。会议最后通过了动员各界人民粉碎帝国主义分子利用天主教进行阴谋活动的决议。决议号召全上海人民行动起来，积极参加这一严肃的斗争；号召天主教内爱国的神职人员和广大教徒行动起来，和教会内部的帝国主义分子划清界限，揭发帝国主义分子及其他反革命分子利用天主教进行的破坏阴谋，为爱护祖国、保障真正的宗教信仰自由而斗争。
    目前，上海市各界人民和爱国的天主教徒正根据市协商委员会所通过的决议，进一步掀起反帝爱国的斗争。
