Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 27th: The delegation representatives of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations have corrected and finally approved the military demarcation line between the two sides in accordance with the actual line of contact between the two sides.

    The final corrected military demarcation line starts from Jiangting, six kilometers southeast of Goseong on the east coast, and extends southwest to Deoksan-ri, south of Goseong. It runs along the east bank of the Nam River through Baekilpo, Sindaeri, and Gumalli, then southwest along the Nam River to Sinthan-ri. It continues southwest, passing 21.5 kilometers west of Ganseong to Zhangxiang, one kilometer south of Changseung-ri, 1.5 kilometers south of Seohui-ri, half a kilometer north of Gachilbong, and west of Satari to Mundeong-ri. Then, it passes three kilometers south of Euhyeon Mountain and enters the Bukhan River one kilometer north of Ma Seok Rock, heading northwest and then west nearly five kilometers south of Gwaho-ri, merging with the Geumseongcheon River at Deungdae-ri. It runs west along the Geumseongcheon River to one kilometer southeast of Sehyun-ri, continuing west for 9.5 kilometers south of Geumseong, then slightly southwest, passing three kilometers south of Gyotae-ri, 1.5 kilometers south of Sanggamryeong, and west again, passing south of Geumgok-ri, 11.5 kilometers south of Pyeonggang to Sagimakeu, and 8 kilometers north of Cheorwon to Hwigyeong-ri. It then runs southwest, passing 15 kilometers west of Cheorwon to Sinhyun-ri, 7 kilometers east of Saknyeong to Doyeo-ri, and then at a larger angle to the southwest, entering the Imjin River at Gyeho-dong. It runs along the river to half a kilometer east of Goyangdae, then turns west-southwest, passing Gigok-ri, six kilometers east of Guhwari, and south, passing half a kilometer east of Cheongting-ri. It crosses south of the 38th parallel at Gyedang Village, two kilometers northwest of Goranpo-ri, then southwest past Panmunjom Bridge, southeast of Panmunjom, and then south along the east of the Sajun River into the Imjin River, and then into the Han River until the west coast.

    The first agreement on the military demarcation line between the two sides in the Korean armistice negotiations was reached on November 27, 1951. In the 18 months and 20 days that followed, due to changes in the actual line of contact between the two sides, the two sides again adopted a revised military demarcation line on June 17, 1953. This revision shows that in 18 months and 20 days, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers had advanced to varying degrees to the south in nine places along the entire line, with a total area of ​​150 square kilometers. The larger advances included: a one-kilometer advance in the three-kilometer-wide area between Deoksan-ri south of Goseong and Baekilpo on the east coast; a seven-kilometer advance in the thirteen-kilometer area south of Yongho-dong, 12.5 kilometers southeast of Geumseong, to Byeonam-dong, 9.5 kilometers west of Mundeong-ri; a nearly one-kilometer advance in the area from 5.5 kilometers southeast of Saknyeong to 6 kilometers of Goyangdae; an advance of one to three and a half kilometers in the approximately 22-kilometer area from Hageom, 5.5 kilometers southeast of Guhwari, to the north bank of the Imjin River; an advance of one to two kilometers in the ten-kilometer area from three kilometers south of Panmunjom to the north bank of the Imjin River. During the same period, the United Nations forces only made small advances in areas east of Mundeong-ri, northwest of Gimhwa, northeast of Cheorwon, and west of Yeoncheon, with a total area of ​​5.3 square kilometers. This shows that during this period, the changes in the actual line of contact between the two sides were almost entirely advances to the south.

    After the military demarcation line was determined for the second time, the Syngman Rhee group's sabotage of the agreement and opposition to the armistice delayed the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement by more than a month. During this month, the actual line of contact between the two sides changed again. Therefore, the two sides in the Korean armistice negotiations re-corrected the military demarcation line for the third time on July 24. In this month, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers advanced another 192.9 square kilometers southward in eight areas along the entire line, an advance of 332.6 square kilometers southward compared to the first military demarcation line. The main change was in the area south of Geumseong, where the battle line advanced nine kilometers south, leveling the original arc-shaped battle line that ran from 14 kilometers southeast of Geumseong to 16 kilometers southwest, passing half a kilometer south of Geumseong, advancing 169.2 square kilometers. In addition, the advance of the Korean-Chinese People's forces on the east coast pushed the starting point of the military demarcation line a quarter of a kilometer south, and the advance in the area northwest of Goranpo-ri moved the point where the military demarcation line crossed the 38th parallel one kilometer east. During the same period, the United Nations forces were unable to advance their positions northward at all. Therefore, in the month after the second revision of the military demarcation line, all changes in the military demarcation line were advances to the south.

    关于军事分界线附图的说明
    【新华社开城二十七日电】朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团已经按照双方实际接触线校正并最后批准了双方的军事分界线。
    最后校正的军事分界线自东海岸高城东南六公里之江亭起，向西南至高城以南之德山里，沿南江东岸经白日浦、新岱里、九万里，然后沿南江向西南至新炭里，再继续向西南经杆城以西二十一公里半之獐项、长承里南一公里、西希里南一公里半、加七峰北半公里、沙汰里向西至文登里，然后经鱼隐山南三公里向西在磨石岩北一公里处入北汉江，向西北经科湖里以南近五公里处又向西，在登大里与金城川会合，沿金城川向西至细岘里东南一公里继续向西经金城以南九公里半，再稍向西南经桥田里以南三公里、上甘岭以南一公里半又向西经金谷里以南、平康以南十一公里半之沙器幕、铁原以北八公里之桧井里，再向西南经铁原以西十五公里之薪岘里、朔宁以东七公里之陶渊里，又以更大的角度向西南经桂湖洞入临津江，沿江至高阳岱以东半公里再向西转西南经九化里东六公里之基谷里，向南经青廷里东半公里，在高浪浦里西北两公里之桂堂村越过三八线以南向西南经板门店东南之板门桥，然后向南沿砂川河以东入临津江，然后入汉江直到西海岸。
    朝鲜停战谈判双方第一次关于军事分界线问题达成协议是在一九五一年十一月二十七日。在此后的十八个月又二十天中，由于双方实际接触线有了变化，双方又于一九五三年六月十七日通过了修正的军事分界线。这一修正说明：在十八个月又二十天中，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军在全线九处地方都向南有了不同程度的推进，推进的总面积为一百五十平方公里。其中推进较大的是：在东海岸高城以南德山里至白日浦间三公里宽的地区推进了一公里，在金城东南十二公里半之龙虎洞至文登里以西九公里半之边岩洞以南的十三公里地区内推进了七公里，在朔宁东南五公里半至高阳岱之六公里地区内推进了近一公里，在九化里东南五公里半之下勿闲至临津江北岸约二十二公里的地区推进了一公里至三公里半，在板门店以南三公里至临津江北岸的十公里地区内推进了一公里至两公里。而在同一时期中，联合国军则仅在文登里以东、金化西北、铁原东北、涟川以西等地有小的推进，推进的总面积为五点三平方公里。由此表明：在这一时期中，双方实际接触线的变化，几乎都是向南推进的。
    军事分界线第二次被确定下来以后，由于李承晚集团破坏协议反对停战，使朝鲜停战协定的签字推迟了一个多月。在这一个多月中，双方实际接触线又有了变化。因之，朝鲜停战谈判双方又在七月二十四日第三次校正了军事分界线。在这一个多月中，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军又在全线八个地区向南推进了一百九十二点九平方公里，比第一次的军事分界线向南推进了三百三十二点六平方公里。其中主要的变化是在金城以南地区，在这里战线向南推进了九公里，使原来自金城东南十四公里至西南十六公里经过金城南半公里的一条弧形战线拉平，向前推进达一百六十九点二平方公里。此外，朝中人民部队在东海岸的推进使军事分界线的起点向南推动了四分之一公里，在高浪浦里西北地区的推进使军事分界线越过三八线的地点向东移动了一公里。在同一时期中，联合国军的阵地一点也没有能够向北推进。所以，在第二次修正军事分界线以后的一个多月中，军事分界线的变动全部是向南推进的。
