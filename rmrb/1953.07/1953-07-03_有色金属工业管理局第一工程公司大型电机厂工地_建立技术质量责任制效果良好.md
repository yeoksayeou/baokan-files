The "Anti-Waste and Establishment of Responsibility System" campaign at the construction site of the Large Electric Motor Factory of the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau has entered the construction phase since early May. In early May, after the construction site delineated the responsibilities of each functional group and clarified the relationship between them, it then concentrated its efforts on establishing a technical quality responsibility system to meet the needs of the construction site. After half a month, the construction site has established five types of technical responsibility systems, including chief engineer, drawing research and handover, enlargement of samples, surveying and setting out, and independent inspection, and has universally established a team quality responsibility system. It is now further studying various professional responsibility systems such as reinforced concrete and metal structures.

In response to past shortcomings in construction and the needs of the construction process, the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau divides the technical quality responsibility system into two categories: key responsibility system, professional responsibility system, and worker team responsibility system.

The key responsibility system refers to the responsibility system that is common and related to every construction worker on the construction site. It includes the following five types:

One, drawing and construction sample responsibility system. Drawings and construction samples are the fundamental basis for construction. If there are errors in it, or if construction personnel do not pay attention to it, it will cause serious errors. There have been many lessons learned in the past. Analysis of past lessons learned shows that in order to discover errors in drawings or construction samples in a timely manner and enable all construction personnel to have a correct understanding of drawings and construction samples, the drawings and construction samples must be reviewed, handed over, and studied. These tasks should be assigned to specific personnel. Construction samples are generally drawn on the construction site. Therefore, a special responsibility system for drawing construction samples must also be established. Construction samples are generally the responsibility of the dedicated construction worker.

Two, surveying and setting out responsibility system. Surveying and setting out determines the shape, specifications, and location of each part of the building's structure. Even a slight deviation in the elevation of the building will cause irreparable losses. Based on past situations, it was decided to establish a special responsibility system for the calibration, use, and storage of instruments, as well as for specific personnel to pull the tape measure, read the tape measure, record, re-measure, set out, and re-check in the surveying and setting out responsibility system. In order to ensure the high accuracy of special projects, special personnel must also be designated to be responsible for surveying and setting out and settlement observation.

Three, technical inspection and scientific experiment responsibility system. The technical inspection and scientific experiment responsibility system is the basic method for supervising and ensuring project quality. The Large Electric Motor Factory construction site divides the technical inspection responsibility system into three types: construction inspection, independent inspection, and mass inspection. The chief engineer should be responsible for inspecting the main structure and concealed project parts in the construction inspection, and the designated construction worker and construction worker can be responsible for the regular inspection and preliminary inspection of the completion. Independent inspection includes concealed project inspection and sub-item project inspection, which are the responsibility of the designated inspector by the technical inspection team according to the project category. Mass inspection includes regular general inspections and daily closing inspections, which are respectively presided over by the chief engineer and the designated construction worker. The scientific experiment responsibility system includes two types: raw material experiments and finished product and semi-finished product experiments. The experiments are uniformly handled by the laboratory. The material group is responsible for submitting the test samples for raw materials, and the construction group is responsible for finished and semi-finished products.

Four, implementing operation procedures and quality standards responsibility system. To ensure project quality, it is necessary to implement operation procedures and quality standards. The provisions of the operating procedures and quality standards are, in principle, based on the construction and acceptance technical specifications stipulated by the government, and in order to more effectively implement them into the masses, specific operating procedures and quality standards are formulated separately according to the engineering conditions of the construction site. These procedures and standards are the responsibility of the construction worker to supervise and ensure their implementation.

Five, Chief Engineer Responsibility System. This responsibility system mainly gives the chief engineer certain authority in technology, so that he has the right to decide all technical issues on the construction site, has the right to lead the staff of the technical system under his command, and makes him bear the responsibility for the training and guidance of construction technicians and the responsibility for inspecting construction work. Such as being responsible for the preparation or approval of construction organization design, formulating technical measures, reviewing and handing over drawings, revising, handing over and inspecting operating procedures and quality standards, and deciding on temporary major technical issues.

Professional Responsibility System and Worker Team Responsibility System: In addition to establishing the above-mentioned key responsibility systems, the First Engineering Company also meticulously established a technical quality responsibility system in the team based on the key to ensuring quality, and will establish various professional responsibility systems such as concrete and steel bars according to different types of work.

The leaders of this construction site did not initially understand these contents of the technical quality responsibility system. At the beginning of the transition of the movement to the construction stage, the leaders of the construction site could not grasp the key points of the technical quality responsibility system and could not put forward a complete and practical plan. Some people advocated that the engineer draft a draft for mass discussion; some agreed that the construction worker and technician should discuss it; some believed that the technical responsibility system was the division of labor of technical personnel; some suggested establishing many systems in the construction process to turn the responsibility system into rules of procedure. As a result, the movement once showed signs of relaxation. The leaders of the company studied the specific situation of the construction site, went deep into the construction site to convene a meeting of construction site technicians, solicited their opinions on the content of the technical responsibility system, and provided assistance to the technical cadres responsible for the construction site, encouraging them to actively participate in the movement. At the same time, the construction site also set up a system research team and a propaganda and mobilization team to be responsible for drafting the system and carrying out propaganda and mobilization work. The system research team put forward preliminary opinions on the content of the technical quality responsibility system based on the needs of the project and past experiences and lessons. Under the specific help of the company, the leaders of the construction site determined the formal plan for establishing the technical quality responsibility system.

In the process of establishing the responsibility system, the leaders of the construction site also studied the problems exposed in the stage of exposing the anti-waste and anti-no-one-responsible movement, and separately held forums for surveying personnel and construction personnel to analyze and study. In this way, the content of the responsibility system is relatively rich and effective.

The leaders of the Large Electric Motor Factory construction site also adopted a schedule for discussing the progress of the technical quality responsibility system to promote this work. The general responsibility system adopts the method of group discussion by all technical personnel, and the professional technical responsibility system adopts the method of small group discussion by type of work. The team quality responsibility system organizes construction workers, party and mass cadres to go deep into the site to assist the masses in discussion. Because there was preparation in advance, the discussion was able to focus on the main links, avoiding aimless chatter or the bias of only the leaders putting forward a few methods without everyone's discussion.

In the process of establishing the technical quality responsibility system, the quality of the project has been improved. The concrete quality of the eighteen column foundations that have been constructed all meets the standards; the quality of the steel bars in the foundation chassis is very good. The sense of responsibility of technical personnel has also been greatly strengthened. The workers said, "The movement really solves the problem. In the past, we stayed on the site for half a day without any work. Now the construction worker sits on the site waiting for us early in the morning, and allocates work as soon as we arrive." However, some technical cadres still have a feeling of not daring to take responsibility, and hope that their responsibility will be as small as possible. The leaders of the construction site have paid attention to this problem, and have held many heart-to-heart talks with technical personnel and meetings between construction workers and workers to achieve certain results. However, the problem has not been solved deeply and meticulously enough, and this work needs to be strengthened.

    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司大型电机厂工地
    建立技术质量责任制效果良好
    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司大型电机厂工地的“反浪费与建立责任制”运动，从五月上旬起即已进入建设阶段。五月上旬，工地划分了各职能组的职责范围并分清相互间的关系以后，接着，为适应工地需要，就集中力量建立了技术质量责任制。经过半个月时间，这个工地已建立了主任工程师、图纸研究交代、放大样、测量放线、独立检查等五种技术责任制，并普遍地建立了小组质量责任制。现正进一步研究钢筋混凝土、金属结构等各项专业责任制。
    针对过去施工中的缺点和施工过程中的需要，有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司把技术质量责任制分为重点责任制和专业责任制、工人小组责任制两类。
    重点责任制是指共同性的、和工地的每个施工人员都有关系的责任制度。它包括以下五种：
    一、图纸及施工大样责任制。图纸和施工大样是施工的根本依据。如果它有错，或是施工人员不重视它，就会造成严重的错误。过去这方面的教训是很多的，从过去的教训中分析，如果要及时发现图纸或施工大样中的错误，并使全体施工人员对图纸和施工大样有正确的认识，对图纸和施工大样必须进行审查、交代、研究。这几种工作都应有专人负责。施工大样一般均在施工现场绘制。所以还须建立施工大样绘制专责制。施工大样一般均由专责施工员负责。
    二、测量放线责任制。测量放线决定建筑物每一部分结构的形状、规格和位置。建筑物的标高稍有偏差，即会造成不可挽回的损失。根据过去情况，决定在测量放线责任制中建立对仪器的校正、使用、保管以及专人拉尺、读尺、记录、复测、放线、复查等专责制。为了保证特殊工程的高度正确性，还须另行指定专人负责测放和沉降观测。
    三、技术检查、科学试验责任制。技术检查与科学试验责任制是监督与保证工程质量的基本方法。大型电机厂工地把技术检查责任制分成三种：施工检查、独立检查和群众检查。施工检查中主要结构及隐蔽工程部分应由主任工程师负责检查，经常检查及竣工初步检查可由专责施工员及施工员负责。独立检查包括隐蔽工程检查及分部分项工程检查，由技术检查组按工程类别指定专责检查员负责检查。群众检查包括定期大检查及每日收工检查，分别由主任工程师及专责施工员负责主持。科学试验责任制包括原材料试验与成品、半成品试验两种。试验统一由试验室负责。试样报送，原材料由材料组负责，成品半成品由施工组负责。
    四、贯彻操作规程和质量标准责任制。要保证工程质量，必须贯彻操作规程和质量标准。操作规程与质量标准的规定，原则上根据政府规定的施工、验收技术规范，为了更有效地贯彻到群众中去，又根据施工现场的工程情况另行拟订具体的操作规程与质量标准。这些规程和标准，由施工员负责监督与保证执行。
    五、主任工程师责任制。这个责任制，主要是在技术上给予主任工程师以一定的权限，使他有权决定施工现场的一切技术问题，有权领导所属技术系统的工作人员，并使他担负起对施工技术人员培养与指导的责任，以及对施工工作检查的责任。如负责编制或批准施工组织设计、拟定技术措施、图纸的审查与交代、操作规程与质量标准的修订、交代与检查，以及临时重大技术问题的决定等。
    专业责任制和工人小组责任制：除了订立上述各种重点责任制以外，第一工程公司还在小组里根据保证质量的关键，细致地订立了技术质量责任制，并将根据不同工种，订立混凝土、钢筋等各种专业责任制。
    这个工地的领导方面并不是一开始就弄清技术质量责任制的这些内容的。在运动转入建设阶段之初，工地领导方面抓不住技术质量责任制的重点，提不出一个完整的切实可行的方案。有人主张由工程师拟草案交群众讨论；有的赞成由施工员、技术员大家讨论；有的认为技术负责制就是技术人员的分工；有的建议建立许多施工过程中的制度，把责任制变成办事细则。于是，运动曾一度呈现松懈现象。公司领导方面研究了这个工地的具体情况，深入工地召集了工地技术人员会议，征求他们对技术责任制内容的意见，并对工地负责技术干部进行了帮助，鼓励他们积极参加运动。同时，工地还设立了制度研究组和宣传鼓动组，负责草拟制度和宣传鼓动工作。制度研究组根据工程的需要和过去的经验教训，提出技术质量责任制内容的初步意见。工地领导方面在公司的具体帮助下，确定了建立技术质量责任制的正式方案。
    在建立责任制的过程中，工地领导方面还研究了在反浪费反无人负责运动揭发阶段所暴露出的问题，并分别召开测量人员、施工人员座谈会进行分析研究。这样，责任制的内容就比较充实有效。
    大型电机厂工地领导方面，还采用了讨论技术质量责任制进度表，推动这项工作。一般责任制采取全体技术人员大组讨论，专业技术责任制按工种分小组讨论的办法。小组质量责任制则组织施工员、党群干部深入现场协助群众讨论。由于事先有了准备，因此，讨论能够集中在主要环节上，避免了漫无边际地乱谈或只由领导方面提出几条办法而不经大家讨论的偏向。
    在建立技术质量责任制过程中，工程质量已经有了改进。已施工的十八个柱子基础，混凝土质量都合乎标准；基础底盘钢筋质量很好。技术人员责任心也大大加强了。工人说：“运动真解决问题，过去到现场呆半天还没活干，现在施工员一早就坐在现场等我们，一到就分配工作。”可是在部分技术干部中还有不敢负责的情绪，希望自己的责任越少越好。工地领导方面已经注意了这个问题，开了多次技术人员谈心会，施工员、工人思想见面会，取得了一定效果。但是问题解决得还不够深入细致，这一工作还有待加强。
