    Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration is Improving Mail Sorting and Dispatch Work

    Letter from the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration: The "Reader's Letters Digest" column on April 29th published a letter from reader Liu Zhongxiang, raising concerns about the fact that post and telecommunications bureaus in various parts of Northeast China do not directly dispatch mail to various regions within the customs, but instead send large quantities to the Tianjin and Beijing post offices for forwarding, resulting in delays and wasted manpower. The main reason for this situation is our insufficient implementation of procedural rules and some loopholes and shortcomings in certain system regulations. In order to correct this shortcoming, our bureau began in the second quarter of this year to instruct various bureaus in Northeast China to make improving sorting and dispatch work one of the key tasks, and has organized a working group to pilot improvements in the Shenyang Post Office to gain experience. Recently, it is planned to take the following measures to improve the mail sorting and dispatch work: (1) Implement the existing sorting system and appropriately increase the number of direct dispatch bureaus; (2) Supplement and issue a list of transit bureaus in various parts of the country within the customs, and organize dispatch and sorting personnel to study it; (3) Convene a planned transportation meeting, with improving dispatch and sorting work as one of the main topics of the meeting.

    东北邮电管理局正在改进邮件分拣封发工作
    东北邮电管理局来信：四月二十九日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者刘锺祥的来信，对东北各地邮电局发往关内各地区邮件不直接封发，大量集中发往天津、北京两邮局转发，以致使邮件延误并浪费人力一事提出意见。所以发生这种情况，主要是因为我们贯彻手续制度不够和某些制度规定尚有漏洞缺点。我局为了纠正此种缺点，在本年第二季度开始，曾指示东北各局把改进分拣封发工作作为重点工作之一，并已组织工作组在沈阳邮局试行改进，摸索经验。最近拟采取以下措施，改进邮件分拣封发工作：（一）贯彻既有分拣制度，适当增加直封局；（二）补充印发关内各地转口局名表，组织封发、分拣人员学习；（三）召开计划运输会议，将改进封发、分拣工作作为会议主要内容之一。
