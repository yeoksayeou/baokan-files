Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Tokyo: The issue of Japan accepting U.S. Mutual Security Agency "aid," which the U.S. and the Yoshida government have been discussing behind the scenes for a long time, formally began negotiations on the 15th to conclude relevant agreements. In addition to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Allison and Yoshida government Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki, representatives from the U.S. occupation forces in Japan and the Yoshida government's Security Agency also attended the negotiations. Kyodo News reported that "the central issues of future negotiations will be the conditions of aid, the prohibition of transferring aid materials, the preservation of secrets, regulations on gradually increasing defense capabilities, and the legal status of (U.S.) military advisory groups," all of which are closely related to the U.S.'s efforts to further control Japan and supervise its rearmament.

Allison's speech at the first negotiation meeting further exposed the U.S.'s purpose in giving Japan Mutual Security Agency "aid," which is precisely to intensify Japan's rearmament and make Japan a cannon fodder in the U.S.'s aggressive wars, which the Yoshida government has been trying to cover up. Allison said that if Japan accepts Mutual Security Agency "aid," it must "take all reasonable measures necessary to develop its defense capabilities" and must "fulfill its military obligations under multilateral or bilateral agreements and treaties in which the United States participates."

The current negotiations were forced to be announced under the pressure of the Japanese public. The Yoshida government's acceptance of U.S. Mutual Security Agency "aid" was determined long ago. U.S. Mutual Security Agency Director Stassen admitted on the 9th while testifying before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee: "We do have a suitable plan for building up Japan's strength, and I would like to discuss it in an executive (secret) session." After U.S. Secretary of State Dulles revealed to the U.S. Congress that the Yoshida government was prepared to expand the Japanese "Security Force" to ten divisions, Mitsu Kono, Vice Chairman of the Policy Deliberation Council of the right-wing Socialist Party, an opposition party in Japan, pointed out: "Secretary of State Dulles' testimony proves that the Mutual Security Agency's aid agreement to Japan has already been established between the Japanese and American governments. From this, it can be seen that the testimonies made by Prime Minister Yoshida, Foreign Minister Okazaki, etc. in the Diet are very clearly completely deceiving the people."

Because Dulles' testimony revealed the Yoshida government's secret plan for rearmament and aroused opposition from the broad masses of the Japanese people and attacks from the Japanese opposition parties, the current negotiations between the U.S. and Japan have encountered new difficulties. The "New York Times" admitted in a telegram on the 12th, "Mr. Dulles' statement undoubtedly complicates the work of American diplomats who are scheduled to begin negotiations with the Japanese side on the mutual security plan next week."

### 美国企图加紧重新武装日本  吉田政府接受美“援”的谈判开始

    美国企图加紧重新武装日本
    吉田政府接受美“援”的谈判开始
    【新华社十六日讯】  东京消息：美国和吉田政府已在幕后商谈很久的关于日本接受美国共同安全署
    “援助”问题，已从十五日起正式开始谈判缔结有关协定。出席谈判的除了美国驻日大使艾利逊和吉田政府外相冈崎胜男之外，并有美国驻日占领军和吉田政府保安厅的代表等。共同社报道，“今后谈判的中心问题将是援助的条件、禁止出让援助物资、保守机密、逐步增加防卫力量的规定、（美国）军事顾问团的法律地位”等问题，这些问题是与美国进一步控制日本和监督日本重新武装的努力密切相关的。
    艾利逊在第一次谈判会上的发言进一步暴露了美国给日本以共同安全署“援助”的目的，正是吉田政府百般掩盖的加紧重新武装日本和使日本充当美国的侵略战争中的炮灰。艾利逊说：日本如接受共同安全署“援助”，它就必须“采取各种发展它的防卫力所需的合理措施”；就必须“履行它在有美国参加的多边或双边协定和条约中所承担的军事义务”。
    目前的谈判是在日本公众的压力之下才被迫宣布的。吉田政府接受美国共同安全署“援助”的问题是早已确定了的。美国共同安全署署长史塔生九日在美国参议院拨款委员会作证时承认：“我们的确有一个关于建立日本力量的适当的计划，我愿在行政（秘密）会议中讨论它。”在美国国务卿杜勒斯向美国国会透露吉田政府已经准备将日本“保安队”扩充到十个师之后，日本在野党右派社会党政策审议会副会长河野密指出：“美国国务卿杜勒斯的证言，证明了共同安全署对日援助协定已经在日美两国政府之间成立。由此可知，首相吉田、外相冈崎等人在国会所作证言非常明显地完全是欺骗人民的。”
    由于杜勒斯的证言透露了吉田政府重新武装的秘密计划并引起了日本广大人民的反对和日本反对党的乘机攻击，美日两国之间目前的谈判，已遭到新的困难。“纽约时报”十二日在一篇电讯中承认，“杜勒斯先生的声明毫无疑问地使得定于下周和日本方面就共同安全计划开始谈判的美国外交官员的工作复杂化了”。
