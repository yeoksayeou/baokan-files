    Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 18th: The national bourgeoisie of Southeast Asian countries are increasingly resolute in opposing the US manipulation of the capitalist world market and demanding that their governments expand trade and business relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

    "Indian Finance," the mouthpiece of the Indian business community, demands the immediate abolition of the so-called General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of Geneva, which is an instrument of US monopoly capital.

    The publication points out that not only India, but other countries are also increasingly dissatisfied with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of Geneva.

    According to the Pakistani magazine "Karachi Commerce Weekly," trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is the only way out for those Asian countries suffering great economic difficulties. The publication says that this is especially required by those Asian countries that are still directly controlled economically by Western colonial countries.

    The weekly says that as a result of only trading with Western countries, the economic situation of Asian countries is deteriorating, exports are constantly decreasing, and industrial enterprises are reducing production. The weekly concludes: Therefore, backward Asian countries particularly hope to develop free and unrestricted trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

    Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 18th: The increasingly rampant activities of American monopoly capital in India, which is determined to squeeze out British capital, have intensified the contradictions between the two countries. According to reports in Bengali newspapers, until recently, British capital held a unique dominant position in the Indian Iron and Steel Company. However, the United States has now squeezed British capital out of the company through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which it controls. In order to borrow 126 million rupees, the company has mortgaged all its real estate, including the steel plant in Bumpal and its coal, mica, iron sand, copper, and other strategic raw materials, to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as a condition of exchange. In addition, the company has to pay 7.2 million rupees annually to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as interest.

    印度等国民族资产阶级反对美国操纵市场
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社德里讯：东南亚国家的民族资产阶级越来越坚决地反对美国操纵资本主义世界市场，并要求他们的政府扩大与苏联和人民民主国家的贸易与事务关系。
    印度商业界的喉舌“印度财政”要求立即废除所谓日内瓦关税贸易总协定，这个协定是美国垄断资本的工具。
    这个刊物指出，不仅印度，而且其他国家也对日内瓦关税贸易总协定越来越感到不满。
    据巴基斯坦杂志“喀喇蚩商业周刊”说，与苏联以及人民民主国家进行贸易，是那些遭受很大的经济困难的亚洲国家的唯一出路。这个刊物说，那些在经济上仍直接受西方殖民国家控制的亚洲国家特别要求这样做。
    这个周刊说，由于只和西方国家进行贸易的结果，亚洲国家的经济情况越来越恶化，出口不断减少，工业企业都在减少生产。这个周刊最后说：因此，落后的亚洲国家特别希望发展对苏联以及人民民主国家的自由和不受限制的贸易。
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社德里讯：一心要想挤垮英国资本的美国垄断资本在印度日益猖狂的活动，使得两国之间的矛盾更加尖锐化。据孟加拉报纸报道，不久以前，英国资本在印度钢铁公司还保有独一无二的支配地位。但是，目前美国已经通过它所控制的国际复兴开发银行把英国资本挤出这家公司。为了借取一亿二千六百万卢比的贷款，这家公司已把它全部的不动产，包括在邦帕尔的钢厂和它的煤、云母、铁砂、铜以及其他战略原料，都抵押给国际复兴开发银行作为交换条件。此外，这家公司每年要付七百二十万卢比给国际复兴开发银行作为利息。
