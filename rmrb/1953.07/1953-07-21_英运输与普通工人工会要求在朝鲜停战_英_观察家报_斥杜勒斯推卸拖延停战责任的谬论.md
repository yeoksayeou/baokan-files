    Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: TASS, London, July 18th: The biennial meeting of the Transport and General Workers' Union closed in Southsea on July 17th. This union, with 1.3 million members, is the largest union in Britain. Eight hundred delegates attended the meeting. The delegates unanimously passed a resolution stating that a ceasefire in Korea and the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations are important conditions for maintaining world peace. The resolution also called for steps to increase trade between East and West in order to help solve Britain's balance of payments problems. Andrew Holmes, who proposed the motion on Korea, said: The difficulty facing the world today comes from the West rather than the East. He said that Syngman Rhee's American friends should be held responsible for continuing the Korean War and refusing to admit the People's Republic of China to the United Nations.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: London dispatch: The British "Observer" on July 19th criticized U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' absurd remarks on television and radio on July 17th, which attempted to shift the responsibility for the U.S. delaying the armistice. The newspaper pointed out that Dulles said in the broadcast that it was "ridiculous" for the communist side to ask the United Nations forces to provide guarantees for future actions of South Korea. The newspaper asked: "Is it fair and reasonable to ask the communist side to sign an armistice agreement without publicly providing affirmative guarantees outlining what action should be taken if South Korea violates the armistice in the future?" The newspaper believes: "It should be declared publicly and unequivocally that if Syngman Rhee violates the armistice, the United Nations forces will fight him, disarm him, and use their own strength to ensure that the armistice is respected again in South Korea. Only such a guarantee can eliminate the situation created by Syngman Rhee's many public threats and past acts of bad faith, and save the chance of an armistice; this may also be the best way to prevent Syngman Rhee from undermining the armistice."

    英运输与普通工人工会要求在朝鲜停战
    英“观察家报”斥杜勒斯推卸拖延停战责任的谬论
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦十八日讯：运输与普通工人工会两年一次的会议于七月十七日在南海闭幕。这个拥有一百三十万会员的工会是英国最大的工会。参加这次会议的有八百名代表。代表们一致通过一项决议，认为朝鲜停火及接纳人民中国参加联合国是维护世界和平的重要条件。决议并要求采取步骤来增加东西方之间的贸易，以便有助于解决英国支付差额的问题。提出朝鲜问题提案的安德鲁·霍姆斯说：今天世界所面临的难题是来自西方而不是来自东方。他说，李承晚的美国朋友应该对继续朝鲜战争和拒绝接纳人民中国参加联合国的事情负责。
    【新华社二十日讯】伦敦消息：英国“观察家报”十九日斥责美国国务卿杜勒斯十七日在电视广播中，推卸美国拖延停战的责任的荒谬言论。该报指出，杜勒斯曾在广播中说，共方要求联合国军对韩国将来的行动提出保证真是“荒谬可笑”。该报问道：“要共方签订停战协定，而不公开提出肯定的保证，说明如果南朝鲜日后破坏停战，应采取甚麽行动，这难道是公平合理的吗？”该报认为：“应当毫不含糊地公开宣布，如果李承晚破坏停战，联合国军队将与他作战，把他缴械，并以他们自己的力量使停战在南朝鲜重新受到尊重。只有这样一种保证，才能消除由于李承晚的许多公开威胁和以往的背信行动而造成的局势，并挽救停战的机会；这或许也是防止李承晚破坏停战的最好办法。”
