    Health Work in Eastern European People's Democracies
    Qu Zheng, Member of the Cultural and Educational Delegation to Eastern European People's Democratic Countries
    Last September, I accompanied the Cultural and Educational Delegation to the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries—Poland, Democratic Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria—to investigate health work. During the visit, we listened to reports from the heads of the health ministries of each country and visited hospitals, maternity and child health centers, midwifery stations, health and epidemic prevention stations, tuberculosis hospitals, outpatient clinics, medical colleges, secondary health technical schools, blood transfusion stations, research institutes, nurseries, premature infant hospitals, pharmaceutical factories, factory health and safety equipment, etc.
    Since liberation, the fraternal countries have made rapid progress in health work. They regard health as an important part of the national cause. New medical units have been established in factories, mines, and rural areas. The working people enjoy the benefits of medical and health care. After seven or eight years of construction, the people's health level has been significantly improved: diseases have decreased (especially infectious diseases), mortality rates have decreased, and birth rates have increased. In addition, a large number of health cadres have been trained. Now I will describe some of the problems we have seen below for the reference of health workers in our country.
    Implement the Policy of Facing Workers and Peasants
    During the period of reactionary rule, the medical work of various countries served the bourgeoisie, and for the working people, it could only be regarded as a so-called "charitable cause." After liberation, under the leadership of the parties and people's democratic governments of various countries, the policy of health work has undergone fundamental changes, embarking on the correct path of prevention first and facing workers and peasants.
    Some countries, due to the serious damage to the economy, culture, and other aspects during the war, the people's health was greatly affected, and there had been epidemics of infectious diseases. After the end of the war, the People's Government used great efforts to carry out epidemic prevention work, and achieved great results. For example, in Poland, from 1944 to 1946, there were epidemics of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, dysentery, malaria, etc. In order to eradicate these infectious diseases, the Polish People's Government established an Extraordinary Epidemic Prevention Committee in Warsaw, and branches were established in various places to preside over epidemic prevention work, and all infectious diseases were treated free of charge. This measure was warmly supported by the people. By 1949, malaria had almost disappeared, and other infectious diseases had also been greatly reduced. In addition, active prevention was carried out for chronic infectious diseases, social diseases, such as tuberculosis, venereal diseases, and diarrhea and rickets unique to children. Three hundred tuberculosis prevention work groups, venereal disease research institutes and prevention and control groups were established throughout the country, and a children's disease prevention movement was launched.
    Romania and Bulgaria have established health and epidemic prevention stations and tuberculosis and venereal disease prevention organizations under governments at all levels; and decided that doctors' treatment work should be combined with prevention work: in addition to treatment, doctors should also take time to go to factory workshops or among residents to guide health prevention work. Czechoslovakia and Hungary have similar organizations.
    On the issue of facing workers and peasants, the people's democratic countries have implemented or expanded the labor insurance system. The number of people covered by labor insurance varies from country to country. In some countries, the number of people covered by labor insurance reaches 50%, and the highest has reached over 90%. They all enjoy the right to free treatment and free recuperation. After the implementation of this system, the health of the working people has been guaranteed, thereby strengthening the strength of socialist construction. At the same time, health construction first takes care of factories and mines. For example, in Romania, the number of medical personnel in major industrial centers is relatively large and the quality is relatively good, with an average of one doctor for every 400 workers. In Bulgaria, clinics and first-aid stations (increased from 150 in 1944 to 660) and hospitals (30 have been established) have been established in major factories. In rural areas, countries have established hospitals, midwifery stations, clinics, etc. of varying numbers and sizes, according to different objective conditions. Romania also dispatched medical teams to fishing areas and forest areas to carry out prevention and control work. Poland implements free treatment for poor peasants; and charges 30% of the fee for middle peasants.
    Maternal and Child Health and Encouraging Childbearing
    The People's Democratic countries not only pay attention to general health work, but also attach great importance to women and children's health work. Midwifery stations have been universally established in various places. For example, in Czechoslovakia, 70% of pregnant women, and in Poland, 85% of pregnant women, are delivered by midwives. Many regions have implemented pregnancy check-ups and adopted painless delivery methods to reduce women's labor pains. Women participating in social labor are granted leave before and after childbirth.
    Children's health is regularly checked. For example, in Czechoslovakia, infants under one year old are examined ten times a year; those over two years old are examined three or four times a year; and those over three years old are examined twice a year. Romania has specially established nutrition rooms for children suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. Poland has established nurseries for sick children; Hungary and Czechoslovakia have premature infant hospitals, so that infants weighing less than two kilograms can continue their lives. The facilities of the premature infant hospital are extremely complete. In addition, various nurseries, children's sanatoriums, convalescent hospitals, etc. have been established in various countries.
    The People's Democratic countries all issue clothes, diapers, etc. to newborns. Romania provides financial assistance to families with more than four children, and gives mothers with more than ten children the title of "Hero." In Hungary, mothers who give birth to their sixth child receive a bonus of 2,000 forints, and families with many children can receive certificates from the government and receive a certain amount of subsidies every month.
    Reform of the Medical System
    With the reform of the political and economic system, various countries have learned from the Soviet Union's experience and carried out reforms in the medical system. This is to combine outpatient treatment work with hospital treatment work, so that treatment work and prevention work are combined; fix the treatment location for residents, so that doctors' sense of responsibility is further enhanced. This new working system is called the integrated medical system.
    Now, let's take the situation in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, as an example to illustrate. The city is divided into eight medical districts, each with an outpatient clinic and a hospital. Residents and factories in a district are responsible for outpatient, home visit, or hospitalization by the outpatient clinic and hospital in the district. The doctors in the outpatient clinic are also the doctors in the hospital. All doctors are also divided according to the area and are responsible for the treatment work of residents. The fixed doctor is responsible for the patient from the beginning to the cure. When there are difficulties, the doctor in charge can conduct research with other doctors. Patients can seek medical treatment or invite doctors to make house calls within a certain period of time. This makes it very convenient for residents to seek medical treatment, and doctors can also have a deep understanding of the patient's condition, making it easier to carry out treatment. At the same time, doctors can also go to residents' homes at a certain time to understand their health conditions. This new working system can play a greater role in promoting people's health and ensuring socialist construction.
    Development and Reform of Medical Education
    The number of medical personnel trained by various countries during the period of reactionary rule was not only small, but also of poor quality. After liberation, in order to carry out people's health work, the medical personnel left over from the old society could not meet the needs of society in all aspects. Under this situation, the people's governments of various countries actively built new schools and transformed and expanded old schools to train new types of medical workers in large numbers to serve socialist construction. For example, Poland had five medical colleges, and five new ones were built, and the number of secondary health schools was increased to more than 30. Romania had five medical colleges and built two new ones. Czechoslovakia had three medical colleges and built four new ones, with a total of 80 secondary health technical schools, with a total of 6,000 students graduating each year. Hungary has four medical colleges, with 800 to 900 students enrolling each year. Bulgaria has two medical colleges, which have trained a large number of doctors after liberation, increasing the number of doctors in the country by two and a half times; 18 secondary health technical schools have trained a large number of intermediate health workers, increasing the number of midwives by three times and nurses by seven times.
    Before liberation, the vast majority of students in various schools were children of the bourgeoisie. After liberation, a scholarship system was established, and the school opened its doors to children of workers and peasants. Now most of the students are children of workers and peasants.
    In terms of medical education reform, one is the reform of the school system, and the other is the transformation of the style of study. In terms of school system reform, due to the different situations in various countries, some medical colleges are five-year systems, and some are six-year systems (both have one year of internship); in terms of the setting of departments, some medical colleges are divided into general medicine department, pediatrics department, public health department, pharmacy department, and dentistry department, and some medical colleges do not have departments. Although the length of schooling of secondary health technical schools varies, they are all required to reach the equivalent of secondary school graduation level (high school graduation level in our country) upon graduation. In terms of the style of study, before liberation, the university was full of a free and undisciplined atmosphere. Students could attend classes at will, and some even did not graduate after ten years of study. Teachers also gave lectures according to their own preferences, and did not ask whether it met practical needs. Teaching viewpoints and teaching methods were all the bourgeoisie's. After liberation, under the leadership of the parties and governments of various countries, learning from the Soviet Union's experience, this bad style was gradually changed, and a new style was established. Students must pass an examination to enroll, and must attend classes on time after enrollment. Learning is not only the right of students, but also the obligation of students. Those who fail cannot graduate. Graduation must pass a rigorous examination. In terms of teaching, teaching and research groups have been established in each department, and unified teaching plans and teaching syllabuses have been formulated to complete the teaching tasks on time. Some of the textbooks used are Soviet textbooks, and some are written by teachers themselves (they can only be used after public discussion). Teachers often care about students' learning and solicit students' opinions on teaching. Students and teachers cooperate closely to complete the teaching tasks. In terms of teaching methods, the principle of the unity of theory and practice is implemented. Special attention is paid to the ideological education of students. Basic Marxism-Leninism, political economy, dialectical materialism, etc. are all compulsory courses for medical school students, and they are required to pass the graduation examination.
    In addition to training a large number of new types of medical personnel, the People's Democratic countries also adopt many methods to improve the quality of the original medical workers. For example, each province in Poland has technical instructors who regularly go to medical institutions in small cities and rural areas to provide technical guidance. Publications are also published for reference and study by medical personnel on the job. Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria also have doctor's refresher colleges, so that doctors across the country can take refresher courses on time to learn professional skills.
        Ideological Transformation of Health Personnel
    Although the old health personnel have a certain level of technical skills, they are mostly influenced by the bourgeoisie in their thinking. This hinders them from exerting their strength in socialist construction. Therefore, the People's Democratic countries attach great importance to the ideological transformation of the old health personnel. The main method is to combine business with ideological criticism. At the same time, they also use political study groups, listening to reports, and other forms, or transfer medical personnel to party schools or night schools to study, etc., to conduct regular political education for them, so that they can realize the greatness of the working class and the correctness of the socialist road. The old health personnel welcome and support the ideological transformation. For example, Romania convened the Pavlovian theory discussion conference in 1952, which was attended by 50,000 people. At the meeting, Soviet experts gave reports, and the issue of doctors' position was discussed, and backward ideas and bourgeois medical viewpoints were criticized. At the same time, it was studied how to carry forward the original fine style of Romanian health personnel and serve the people. After this meeting, health personnel across the country expressed their determination to learn from the Soviet Union and transform their thinking.
    In addition, a reward and punishment system is stipulated for medical personnel to encourage medical personnel to make progress. Outstanding medical workers are given the titles of "People's Doctor" or "Honorary Doctor," or material rewards. Medical workers with a bad style are given public criticism, or even dismissed from their positions.
     Other Achievements in Health Work
    In addition to the above-mentioned, the development of health undertakings in the Eastern European countries in recent years can also be seen from the following statistics:
    In Poland, the number of doctors has developed from 3.7 per 10,000 people to 10 doctors per 10,000 people; the number of hospital beds has developed from 25 per 10,000 people to 46 hospital beds per 10,000 people. First-aid stations have been established in large cities and provinces and counties; clinics have been established in factories and mines. Eighteen blood transfusion stations have been established in 19 provinces, providing approximately 50,000 to 80,000 liters of blood each year. There are currently 3,000 midwives and 600 midwifery stations. According to the 1950 statistics, only 10.4 people per 10,000 died due to tuberculosis. There are a total of 10,000 convalescent beds in the country, and 16,000 people stayed in convalescent homes in 1952. In addition, there are 19 research institutes.
    In Czechoslovakia, 96% of the country's population has labor insurance. In 1951, 300,000 people took vacations. There are 6 hospital beds per 1,000 people. There are 1,300 clinics, 120 maternity and child health centers, 720 health consulting offices, and 19 research institutes throughout the country. According to the 1951 statistics, only 6.6 people per 10,000 died of tuberculosis. The number of phthisis specialists and pediatricians has increased 13 times compared with before; the number of obstetricians and gynecologists has increased five times.
    In Hungary, 70% of the country's population has labor insurance. There are 57 hospital beds per 10,000 people; the number of nurseries has increased 50 times compared with before liberation. There are 7 blood transfusion stations in the country, and 100,000 people supply blood. The general mortality rate is lower than that of the United Kingdom; the birth rate has increased by 47% compared with 1938. In 1952, the number of deaths from tuberculosis decreased by 57% compared with 1938.
    Malaria in Romania has been reduced by 94%; typhoid fever has been reduced by 90%; pellagra has been reduced by 34%; the general mortality rate has been reduced by 40% compared with 1940; and the infant mortality rate has been reduced by 50%.
    More than 90% of the population in Bulgaria has labor insurance. There are already 120 rural hospitals and 651 midwifery stations in the country. There is one doctor for every 900 people.
    The above is only a part of the health work of the Eastern European countries. Due to time constraints, we were unable to conduct a more in-depth investigation, so this can only be a preliminary introduction.

    东欧人民民主国家的卫生工作
    赴东欧人民民主国家文化教育考察团团员  曲正
    去年九月，我随文化教育考察团赴东欧人民民主国家——波兰、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚——考察卫生工作。在考察期间，我们听了各国卫生部首长的报告，参观了医院、妇婴保健院、接生站、卫生防疫站、结核病院、门诊部、医学院、中级卫生技术学校、输血站、研究院、托儿所、早产儿医院、制药厂、工厂卫生安全设备等。
    各兄弟国家在解放以后，卫生工作有飞跃的进展。它们把卫生事业作为国家事业的重要部分。新的医疗单位在工厂、矿山和农村建立起来。劳动人民享受到医药卫生的福利。经过了七、八年的建设，人民的健康水平有显著的提高：疾病减少（尤其是传染病），死亡率降低，出生率增加。此外，并培养了大批的卫生干部。现将我们所看到的一些问题分述于下，供我国的卫生工作者参考。
    贯彻执行面向工农的方针
    在反动统治时期，各国的医务工作是为资产阶级服务的，对于劳动人民只能算是一种所谓“慈善事业”。解放后，在各国的党和人民民主政府领导下，卫生工作方针有了根本的改变，走上了以预防为主、面向工农的正确道路。
    有些国家，由于在战争期间经济文化各方面遭受到严重的破坏，人民的健康受到极大影响，曾发生过流行性传染病。战争结束后，人民政府即用极大的力量进行防疫工作，收到很大的效果。如波兰在一九四四年到一九四六年间，发生了伤寒、副伤寒、赤痢、疟疾等流行病。为了扑灭这些传染病，波兰人民政府在华沙成立了非常防疫委员会，各地成立了分会，主持防疫工作，对一切传染病都实行免费治疗。这种措施得到人民的热烈拥护。到一九四九年疟疾几乎绝迹，其他传染病也大为减少。另外对于慢性传染病、社会病，如结核病、性病及儿童特有的腹泻和软骨病等，都积极进行了预防。全国设立了三百个防痨工作组、性病研究所和防治组，并展开了儿童防病运动。
    罗马尼亚、保加利亚都在各级政权下设立了卫生防疫站及防痨防性病等组织；并决定医生的治疗工作要和预防工作相结合：医生除进行治疗以外，并抽出一定的时间到工厂车间或居民中去指导卫生预防工作。捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利也有同样的组织。
    在面向工农的问题上，各人民民主国家实行了或扩大了劳动保险制度。劳动保险的人数各国不同，有些国家的劳动保险人数达到百分之五十，最高的已达到百分之九十以上。他们都享受免费治疗、免费休养的权利。实行这种制度以后，劳动人民的健康得到了保障，从而加强了社会主义建设的力量。同时，卫生建设首先照顾到工厂矿山。如罗马尼亚各大企业中心的医务人员，数量较多，质量也较好，平均四百个工人中即有一个医生。保加利亚在各大工厂内均设有诊察、急救所（已从一九四四年的
    一百五十所增加到六百六十所）和医院（已建立三十所）。在农村中，各国根据不同的客观条件，也成立了数目不等、大小不同的医院、接生站、医务所等。罗马尼亚并派遣医疗队赴渔民区、森林区进行防治工作。波兰对于贫农实行免费治疗；对于中农则收百分之三十的费用。
    妇婴卫生和奖励生育
    各人民民主国家不仅注意一般的卫生工作，对于妇女和儿童卫生工作，也极为重视。各地普遍设立了接生站。如捷克斯洛伐克有百分之七十的产妇、波兰百分之八十五的产妇，均由接生员接生。许多地区实行了孕妇检查，并采用了无痛分娩法，来减轻妇女的分娩痛苦。对于参加社会劳动的妇女，产前产后均规定有假期。
    对于儿童的健康情况，经常进行检查。如捷克斯洛伐克对于一岁以内的婴儿，每年检查十次；满两岁的，每年检查三、四次；三岁以上的每年检查两次。罗马尼亚特为患肠胃病的儿童设立了营养室。波兰为病儿设立了托儿所；匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克设有早产儿医院，使体重在两公斤以下的婴儿仍能继续其生命。早产儿医院的设备极为完善。此外，各国设有各种托儿所、儿童休养所、疗养院等。
    各人民民主国家对于初生儿均发给衣服、尿布等。罗马尼亚对于有四个以上儿童的家庭给以经济上的补助，对于有十个以上儿童的母亲并给以“英雄”称号。匈牙利对于生第六个婴儿的母亲即给两千福林的奖金，子女多的家庭可以得到政府的奖状，每月还可以得到一定数目的津贴。
    医疗制度的改革
    随着政治经济制度的改革，各国学习苏联的经验，在医疗制度方面也进行了改革。这就是把门诊治疗工作和医院治疗工作结合起来，使治疗工作和预防工作结合起来；固定居民的治疗场所，使医生的责任心更加增强。这种新的工作制度叫做联合医疗制度。
    现以罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特市的情况为例加以说明。该市分为八个医疗区，每区设有门诊部和医院。一个区内的居民和工厂，不论门诊、出诊或住院，都由本区内的门诊部和医院负责。门诊部的医生也是医院的医生。所有的医生也按地区分工，负责居民的治疗工作。病人从开始到治愈，均由固定的医生负责。有困难时，负责主治的医生可以和其他的医生进行研究。病人在一定的时间内，可以就诊或邀请医生出诊。这样居民诊病非常便利，医生对于病人的情况也能有深刻的了解，易于进行治疗。同时，医生还可以在一定的时间到居民家中了解他们的卫生状况。这种新的工作制度，在增进人民健康、保证社会主义建设上，可以发挥更大的作用。
    医学教育的发展和改革
    各国在反动统治时期所培养出来的医务人员，不但人数不多，而且质量也差。解放后，为了开展人民的卫生工作，旧社会所留下的医务人员，在各方面都不能满足社会的需要。在这种情况下，各国人民政府积极地建设新的学校，改造、扩大旧的学校，来大批培养新型的医务工作者，为社会主义建设服务。如波兰原有医学院五所，新建五所，中级卫生学校增加为三十余所。罗马尼亚原有医学院五所，新建两所。捷克斯洛伐克原有医学院三所，新建四所，中级卫生技术学校共八十所，每年共有六千学生毕业。匈牙利有医学院四所，每年有八、九百名学生入学。保加利亚有医学院两所，解放后培养了大批的医生，使全国医生增加了两倍半；中级卫生技术学校十八所，培养了大批的中级卫生工作人员，使接生员增加了三倍，护士增加了七倍。
    各校的学生在解放前绝大多数为资产阶级的子女。解放后设立了助学金制度，学校为工农子女开门。现在在校学生多半是工农子女。
    在医学教育改革方面，一是进行了学制的改革，一是进行了学风的改造。在学制改革方面，因各国的情况不同，有的医学院是五年制，有的是六年制（均有一年的实习时间）；在系的设置方面，有的医学院分为一般医学系、小儿科学系、公共卫生学系、药学系、牙科学系，有的医学院则不分系。中级卫生技术学校的修业年限虽各有不同，但都要求在毕业时达到相当于中学毕业程度（我国高中毕业程度）。在学风方面，解放前大学里充满了自由散漫的风气，学生可以随意上课，甚至有学十年还不毕业的。教员也是随自己的所好进行讲学，是否合乎实际需要，则不过问。教学观点、教学方法，全是资产阶级的一套。解放后，在各国的党和政府领导下，学习了苏联的经验，逐渐改变了这种不良的作风，树立起新的作风。学生入学要经过考试，入学后要按时上课。学习不但是学生的权利，而且是学生的义务。成绩不及格的不能毕业。毕业时必须经过严格的考试。在教学方面，各科都成立了教研组，订有统一的教学计划、教学大纲，按时完成教学任务。所用教材，有的是苏联课本，有的是教师自行编写的（经公开讨论始能应用）。教员经常关心学生的学习，征求学生对于教学的意见。学生和教员亲密地合作，为完成教学任务而努力。在教学方法上，贯彻理论和实际一致的原则。对于学生的思想教育，尤其注意。马克思列宁主义基础、政治经济学、辩证唯物主义等，均为医学校学生必修的课程，并要求在毕业考试时必须及格。
    各人民民主国家除培养大批新型的医务人员之外，对于原有的医务工作者，也采用许多办法来提高他们的质量。如波兰各省都设有技术指导员，经常到小城市和农村医疗机构进行技术指导。并出版刊物，供在职医务人员参考学习。波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚还设有医生进修学院，使全国医生可以按时进修，学习专业技术。
        卫生人员的思想改造
    旧有的卫生人员，虽有一定的技术水平，但他们在思想上多半受了资产阶级的影响。这就阻碍着他们在社会主义建设中，发挥自己的力量。因此，各人民民主国家对于旧有卫生人员的思想改造问题，极为重视。主要办法是结合业务进行思想批判。同时，还用政治学习小组、听报告等形式，或抽调医务人员进党校或夜校学习等方法，对他们进行经常的政治教育，使他们认识到工人阶级力量的伟大和社会主义道路的正确。旧有卫生人员对于思想改造，是欢迎和拥护的。如罗马尼亚在一九五二年召开了巴夫洛夫学说讨论大会，参加这次会议的有五万人。会上，请苏联专家作了报告，并讨论了医生的立场问题，也批判了落后思想和资产阶级的医学观点，同时研究了如何发扬罗马尼亚卫生人员原有的优良作风，为人民服务等问题。这次会议以后，全国卫生人员都表示努力向苏联学习，改造自己的思想。
    此外，对医务人员规定了奖惩制度，鼓励医务人员进步。优秀的医务工作者，都得到“人民医生”或“荣誉医生”的称号，或物质奖励。对于作风不良的医务工作者，则给以公开批评，甚至撤消其职务。
     卫生工作上的其他成就
    除以上所谈到的之外，从以下的各项统计也可以看到各人民民主国家卫生事业几年来的发展情况：
    波兰由一万人当中有三点七个医生，发展为一万人当中有十个医生；从一万人当中有二十五张病床，发展为一万人中有四十六张病床。大城市及省县均设有急救站；工厂、矿山均设有门诊部。在十九个省内设有十八个输血站，每年供血约五万到八万公升。现有接生员三千人，接生站六百个。由于结核病而死亡的，据一九五○年的统计，一万人当中只有一○点四人。全国共有一万张休养床位，一九五二年有一万六千人次在休养所休养。此外，还有十九个研究所。
    捷克斯洛伐克全国人口百分之九十六都实行了劳动保险。一九五一年有三十万人休养。一千人当中有六张病床。全国共有一千三百个诊疗所，一百二十个妇幼保健院，七百二十个卫生顾问处，十九个研究所。死于结核病的，据一九五一年的统计，一万人中仅有六点六人。肺痨专科医生和小儿科医生比以前增加了十三倍；妇产科医生增加了五倍。
    匈牙利全国人口百分之七十实行了劳动保险。一万人当中有五十七张病床；托儿所比解放前增加五十倍。全国有七个输血站，有十万人供给血液。一般死亡率低于英国；出生率比一九三八年增加了百分之四十七。一九五二年死于结核病的人数比一九三八年减少了百分之五十七。
    罗马尼亚的疟疾已减少了百分之九十四；伤寒减少了百分之九十；玉蜀黍红斑病减少了百分之三十四；一般死亡率比一九四○年降低了百分之四十；婴儿死亡率降低了百分之五十。
    保加利亚全国人口百分之九十以上实行了劳动保险。全国已有一百二十个农村医院，六百五十一处接生站。九百人当中即有一个医生。
    以上所述，只能说是东欧各国卫生工作的一部分。由于时间关系，我们未能作更深入的考察，因而这只能是一个初步的介绍。
