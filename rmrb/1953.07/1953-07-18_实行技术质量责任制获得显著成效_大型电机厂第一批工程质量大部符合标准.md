The implementation of a technical quality responsibility system has achieved significant results. The first batch of projects at the Large Electric Motor Factory largely meet standards.

After the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration's Large Electric Motor Factory construction site mobilized the masses to establish a technical quality responsibility system, the quality of the first batch of started projects was guaranteed. The quality of 968 cubic meters of concrete work for eighteen foundations, 306 square meters of formwork, as well as earthwork, rebar, surveying and other projects, largely met standards. For example, the quality of the concrete work for eighteen foundations reached over 95%, with only one foundation having minor surface pitting.

The structural architecture of the factory buildings at the Large Electric Motor Factory construction site is complex, the drawings are numerous, and the technical requirements are strict. When construction began this year, the site learned from past experiences and, relying on the masses, established necessary responsibility systems in terms of technical preparation work (including drawing review, drawing explanation, concrete mix proportion, water-cement ratio, large-scale model and sample review system, and raw material inspection system, etc.). The site implemented these systems, fundamentally preventing the occurrence of quality accidents. In the past month or so, the site has discovered and corrected more than 500 errors (including design errors) through drawing reviews.

The Large Electric Motor Factory conducted in-depth mass mobilization work in ensuring project quality. Before the start of each sub-item project, the construction workers went to the workers' dormitories to explain the operating methods and quality requirements to the workers and organized mass discussions. After the masses grasped the quality standards, each team carried out specialized division of labor. The cement worker team was divided into four groups: material transportation, mixing, ash transportation, and tamping, and the responsibilities of each group in terms of quality were determined. During handover between work shifts, acceptance was based on quality certificates. Cement worker technicians recorded cement pouring data every day. Depending on climate changes, slump tests were conducted six or seven times a day to ensure concrete quality. Surveying and setting out lines are the main keys to ensuring the accurate position of building structures. After the implementation of the surveying and setting out responsibility system, the number of surveying and checking works increased from twice to more than seven times. Important markers were protected by wire mesh to ensure the accuracy of the surveying work.

The site's independent technical inspection organization and inspection system also played an important role in ensuring project quality. Inspection personnel went deep into the site, raising the slogan "wherever construction goes, inspectors follow." Concrete inspectors conducted slump tests every day. If they found that the water-cement ratio was incorrect or other problems, they immediately notified the construction workers to correct them. The site promptly commended and rewarded employees who worked diligently and were actively responsible. Fei Yubo, who corrected screws in the rain, and engineer Xue Zhengyang, who actively led inspection work, have been commended. Six first-class quality teams and fourteen second and third-class quality teams were rewarded at a general staff meeting. (Harbin Working Group of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration)

    实行技术质量责任制获得显著成效
    大型电机厂第一批工程质量大部符合标准
    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司大型电机厂工地发动群众建立技术质量责任制后，第一批开工的工程质量得到了保证。十八个基础的九百六十八立方公尺的混凝土工程、三百零六平方公尺的模板工程以及土方、铁筋、测量等工程，质量大部都合乎标准。例如十八个基础的混凝土工程质量达到百分之九十五以上，只有一个基础微有麻面狗洞。
    大型电机厂工地工程厂房建筑结构复杂，图纸繁多，技术要求严格。今年施工时，工地接受过去教训，在技术准备工作方面依靠群众建立了必要的责任制度（包括图纸审查、图纸交代、混凝土配合比、水灰比、大样和样品审查制以及原材料检验制等）。工地贯彻了这些制度，从根本上预防了质量事故的发生。一个多月来，工地通过审查图纸所发现的错误达五百多处（包括设计错误），都纠正了。
    大型电机厂在保证工程质量中，曾做了深入的动员群众的工作。在分部分项工程开工前，施工员都深入到工人宿舍向工人交代操作方法和质量要求，并组织群众讨论。群众掌握了质量标准后，每个小组都进行了专责分工。水泥工小组分成了运料、搅拌、运灰、捣固四个小组，确定了每个小组在质量方面的责任，工序交接班时，都依靠质量合格证验收。水泥工施工员打水泥每天都做记录，根据气候变化，坍落试验每天要做六、七次，以保证混凝土质量。测量放线是保证建筑结构位置准确的主要关键，在贯彻了测量放线责任制后，测量复查工作由过去的两次增加到七次以上，重要的标桩周围都用铁丝网保护起来，保证了测量工作的准确性。
    工地的独立的技术检查机构和检查制度对于工程质量也起了重要的保证作用，检查人员深入现场，提出“施工到那儿，检查员就跟到那儿”的口号。混凝土检查员每天都做坍落试验复查，发现水灰比不对或其他问题，立即就通知施工员纠正。工地对于埋头苦干积极负责的职工及时进行表扬奖励，冒雨校正螺丝的费毓博、积极领导检查工作的工程师薛正扬等已经受到表扬，六个质量一等小组和十四个质量二、三等小组在全体职工大会上受到了奖励。    （有色金属工业管理局哈尔滨工作组）
