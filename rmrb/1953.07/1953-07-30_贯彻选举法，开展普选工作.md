	Implement the Electoral Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work

	Universal Suffrage Work Group, Hengtang Township, Danyang County, Jiangsu Province

	Leverage Local Organizational Strengths to Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work

	The basic-level election work group of Hengtang Township, Danyang County, Jiangsu, paid attention to leveraging local organizational strengths and focused on the ideological education of local cadres during its work, improving the relationship between cadres and the masses and powerfully promoting the progress of both universal suffrage and production work.

	After arriving in Hengtang Township in late May, the work group paid attention to having local cadres use their own brains, come up with ideas, and carry out work in the pilot work of universal suffrage. Therefore, it first gathered with township cadres to explain the work content and requirements of universal suffrage, and clearly put forward that the work of universal suffrage should be closely combined with production. Then, it helped local cadres to arrange production and universal suffrage work according to the current situation and formulate concrete work plans and steps. However, this meeting neglected the ideological situation of the cadres and did not pay attention to helping solve problems. Therefore, although the work was studied and deployed, the township and village cadres were not very energetic. According to this situation, the work group conducted research and found that most cadres did not understand the policy of combining the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline with universal suffrage, and there were many concerns in their minds. For example, Sima Zhonghai, the village chief of the sixth village, believed that universal suffrage was "rectifying cadres" and "changing shifts." Township head Shi Jinsheng himself was not enthusiastic, thinking that when universal suffrage was coming, "don't be busy now, be active after being elected." Some were afraid of "struggle" and afraid of making self-criticisms to the masses. Therefore, the work group held an enlarged meeting of township and village cadres, and in response to these ideological situations, conducted education starting from summarizing the work of the previous stage, affirming past achievements, pointing out shortcomings in past work, and linking current production and universal suffrage work, pointing out the direction of efforts. At the same time, it clearly explained the policy of combining universal suffrage with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, only removing individual bad elements and those who had committed serious mistakes and refused to mend their ways, causing public outrage, from the organs of political power. Those cadres who had committed general mistakes should make self-criticisms and actively change their work style. Through education, the cadres' ideological understanding was improved, their past concerns were eliminated, and their enthusiasm for leading production and universal suffrage was greatly improved. After the cadres' negative emotions were reversed, the entire township's production and universal suffrage work took on a completely new look. Under their active leadership, the harvesting of wheat and barley, weeding of soybean fields, and rescue of seedlings were all successfully completed, and under the slogan of "select good wheat, keep good seeds, select good people, be representatives, good people do good deeds, good seeds produce good seedlings," approximately 100,000 jin of wheat seeds were selected throughout the township. At the same time, the work of population investigation and voter registration for universal suffrage was also successfully completed. For example, Zhang Muhai's mutual aid group in the sixth village, under the division of labor and leadership of the village cadres, combined the promotion of universal suffrage while producing in the fields, and combined the review of voter qualifications while grading and recording work points in the evening. The population investigation and registration made a draft of the registration in advance. In this way, on the one hand, universal suffrage truly served production, and on the other hand, universal suffrage work was completed on time.

	In addition, after the cadres' understanding was improved through education, they earnestly examined the shortcomings and errors in their past work to the masses, and expressed their determination to correct them. This improved the relationship between cadres and the masses and further strengthened the ties between the government and the masses. For example, Sima Shenggui, the village chief of the seventh village, used to have a rigid work style and did not make accounts public, and everyone had a bellyful of opinions. He seriously examined the shortcomings of his past rigid work style and explained all the accounts. The masses unanimously reflected well, saying, "The village chief works actively and conscientiously, but his temper is not very good." People who didn't pay much attention to him in the past are now talking to him about production. After Village Chief Hu Xiaoluo of the ninth village made a self-criticism, the masses said, "Our village chief usually runs around and suffers for everyone, and there is nothing wrong with him. Today, he is also making a self-criticism to us, and we will still elect him as a representative." Because the relationship between cadres and the masses has been improved, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for work and production has generally increased throughout the township, and production and election work have entered a new climax.

	People's Representatives of the Second District of Jinan City Elected

	Actively Contact Constituents to Solicit Proposals

	Since electing their beloved people's representatives, the broad masses of people in the second district of Jinan City have been excitedly approaching the representatives in the posture of masters of the country, proactively talking about their concerns and making constructive suggestions and demands to the government. The representatives are also actively soliciting proposals from their constituents through individual visits, small-scale symposiums, and other means so that they can bring them to the upcoming first session of the district people's congress. Li Zhenjiang (worker, 18 years old), a people's representative from the Daizong Street electoral district, has become even more active and conscientious in his work since being elected, and the residents have reflected, "We elected the right person!" Jiao Shaobin is a people's representative from the Houzaimen Street electoral district. On a rainy night, he disregarded the rain and difficult roads to inspect houses in poor residents' homes to prevent accidents. Zhou Fangqing (female), a people's representative from the Lishanding electoral district, has always been known by the masses as a street cadre who is "active, conscientious, and kind-hearted." Since being elected as a people's representative, she has been even more active and patient in soliciting opinions from the masses. People's Representative Lei Wanyou (Hui nationality) has spent the past few days almost visiting all of the homes of the more than one hundred Hui households living in the second district to widely solicit proposals. According to statistics from the District Election Committee from July 14th to 17th, it has received 2,082 proposals from people from all walks of life, with the most proposals requesting to strengthen municipal construction.

	During this period, the Municipal People's Government dispatched five bureau-level cadres leading more than twenty cadres to work with people's representatives and universal suffrage work groups, going deep into factories, shops, and residences to listen to and solicit the opinions and demands of the masses. Thirty-four electoral districts also have specially set up suggestion boxes. Now, some of the proposals put forward by the people have been resolved. After residents near Tianditan Street requested the construction of sewers, Deputy Mayor Chen Meichuan personally went to inspect them. Jiang Rongzhi, a bully who had always oppressed residents of Huiquansi Street, was immediately detained and interrogated by the People's Government after the facts were verified after the people's exposure. More than thirty proposals put forward by residents of the second and third police stations have been resolved, and the masses' responses have been good, which has further inspired and improved the masses' political enthusiasm and the idea of being the masters of their own affairs.

	Among the proposals put forward by the people, four are relatively large proposals with citywide significance. With the direct assistance and guidance of the Municipal People's Government, after many studies, preliminary handling opinions have been put forward and will be reasonably resolved soon. At present, all of the more than two thousand proposals received in the entire district, except for those that have been resolved, are being transferred to relevant departments for investigation and to put forward handling opinions so that they can be effectively resolved and meet the needs of the masses of people. In the past few days, all agencies and units that have received proposals have immediately sent cadres to conduct investigations and research and solicit the opinions of the masses to handle them properly and meet the needs of the masses.

	Ningxia Province is Now Concentrating its Efforts on Doing a Good Job in the Pilot Work of Universal Suffrage

	The universal suffrage work in Ningxia Province was originally planned to start in June, but in June, the water level of the Yellow River was low, the irrigation water was low, and the irrigation of paddy fields became a problem, while the mountain areas were suffering from drought. In this way, leading irrigation and drought relief work became the urgent task at that time. At the same time, after June, it coincided with the busy farming season, and production work such as summer harvesting and summer selection and drought relief work still needed to be strengthened. Therefore, except for Zhongning County, Alxa Banner, and Ejin Banner, where the two pastoral areas started pilot work in June, the universal suffrage work in all other areas was postponed until after October.

	In order to do a good job in the Zhongning pilot work, the Provincial Election Committee has transferred all of the election work cadres originally sent to the four counties and cities of Zhongwei, Jinji, Lingwu, and Wuzhong to Zhongning, and provincial-level section chiefs have been dispatched to conduct巡回inspection. When the second stage of Zhongning's election work began, each county also dispatched universal suffrage work cadres to Zhongning to participate in the pilot work to absorb and promote experience and lay a good foundation for the province's election work.

	Beijing's Pilot Universal Suffrage Districts Have Submitted Formal Lists of Representative Candidates

	Beijing's pilot universal suffrage districts have successively submitted formal lists of representative candidates. Each electoral district is currently preparing or is in the process of conducting a solemn election based on this list.

	Since the announcement of voter lists in the pilot universal suffrage districts at the end of June, the election work has entered the nomination stage of representative candidates. The nomination of representative candidates is carried out by combining the methods of joint consultation by various democratic parties and people's organizations and proposals by the masses. After these lists of representative candidates proposed from both the top and bottom are collected, they are all submitted to each voter group for careful study and comparison, and then the formal list of representative candidates is proposed according to the voters' democratic decision. The voters in the Anfu Hutong pilot district include urban residents, workers, shop assistants, industrialists and businessmen, cultural and educational workers, and ethnic minorities. The Xidan District Committee of the Communist Party of China held a consultation meeting with the heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations in the district, and jointly proposed a list of candidates for representatives to the district people's congress. Among them are industrial workers, shop assistants, industrialists and businessmen, cultural and educational workers, street residents, ethnic minorities, and street women. In addition to this jointly proposed list of candidates, the voters also proposed more than seventy representative candidates. After collecting the two lists of representative candidates, the election committee handed them over to the voters for discussion.

	The voters were very enthusiastic when discussing the list of candidates. In the Anfu Hutong pilot district in the city, each voter group held two to three meetings and repeatedly discussed the candidates. The vast majority of voters in Caigongzhuang Township in the suburbs participated in voter group meetings, and they realistically and conscientiously evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of the representative candidates. When discussing whether or not Zhao Wangui, the current director of the business committee of the cooperative, should be elected as a representative, a heated debate arose. Everyone thought that he seemed very capable on the surface, but he was not very responsible and did not do a good job, so his name was removed from the formal list of representative candidates. Some representative candidates have always been active in their work, but because there are some shortcomings in their working methods, the voters put forward sincere criticisms and opinions to them. After they made a deep self-criticism to the voters, they still won the trust of the voters. The most popular among the voters are those who are active and conscientious in their work, have a good attitude, and can always consider the interests of the masses. Guo Ronghai, the militia captain of Caigongzhuang Township, and Qi Yuhe, the secretary of the township people's government, are such good cadres, and almost all voter groups recommended them as candidates for district representatives.

专栏：贯彻选举法，开展普选工作

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    江苏省丹阳县横塘乡普选工作组
    发挥当地组织力量开展普选工作
    江苏丹阳县横塘乡基层选举工作组，在进行工作中，注意发挥当地组织力量，抓紧对当地干部的思想教育；改善了干部与群众的关系，有力地推动了普选与生产工作的进展。
    五月下旬，工作组到了横塘乡后，就注意在普选的试办工作中，让当地干部自己动脑筋，出主意，进行工作。于是，首先与乡干部集会，说明普选的工作内容与要求，并明确提出普选工作应紧密结合生产。然后帮助当地干部根据当时的情况，将生产与普选工作进行安排，订出具体的工作计划和步骤。但是在这次会议上，忽略了干部的思想情况，没有注意帮助解决。因此，工作虽然研究布置了，但乡村干部劲头不大。工作组根据这种情况进行研究，发现多数干部由于对结合反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争进行普选的方针政策不了解，思想上存在许多顾虑。如六村村长司马仲海认为普选就是“整干部”、“换换班”。乡长史金生自己也不起劲，认为要普选了，“现在别忙，等选上以后再积极吧。”还有的怕“斗争”，怕向群众作检查。于是，工作组又召开乡村干部扩大会议，针对这些思想情况，从总结前一阶段工作入手进行教育，肯定过去的成绩，指出过去工作中的缺点，联系当前生产及普选工作，指出努力的方向；同时明确地交代结合普选进行反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争的方针，只是把个别坏分子和犯有严重错误而又屡教不改引起群众公愤的分子从政权机构中清洗出去，那些犯有一般错误的干部，应当检讨，积极转变作风。通过教育，干部的思想认识提高一步，过去的顾虑消除了，领导生产与普选的积极性大大提高。干部消极情绪扭转后，全乡生产与普选工作面貌焕然一新。在他们的积极领导下，全乡元麦、大麦的收割、黄豆田的锄草、秧苗的抢救等工作，都顺利地完成了，并在“选好麦，留好种，选好人，当代表，好人办好事，好种出好苗”的宣传下，全乡选麦种约十万斤。同时，普选的人口调查选民登记的工作，也很顺利地完成了。如六村张木海互助组，在村干部的分工领导下，在田里生产时结合进行普选的宣传，晚上评分记工时结合进行选民资格的审查，人口调查登记事前作好登记的草稿，这样，一方面真正作到了普选服从生产，另一方面也使普选工作按时完成。
    另外，干部经过教育认识提高，认真地向群众检查了过去工作中的缺点和错误，表示决心改正，这样就改善了干部与群众的关系，进一步密切了政府与群众的联系。如七村村长司马生桂过去作风生硬，账目不公开，大家一肚子意见，他认真地检查了过去作风生硬的缺点，交代了各项账目后，群众一致反映良好，说：“村长工作积极，办事认真，就是脾气不大好。”过去不大理会他的人，现在也都找他谈生产了。九村村长胡小罗检查后，群众说：“我们村长平常为大家跑路吃苦，没有啥毛病，今天还向我们检讨，我们还要选举他作代表。”由于干部与群众的关系得到改进，全乡干部与群众的工作、生产热情普遍高涨，生产和选举工作进入新的高潮。　（接桂明）
    济南市二区选出的区人民代表
    积极联系选民群众征询提案
    济南市二区的广大人民，自从选出自己所爱戴的人民代表以后，都兴奋地以国家主人翁的姿态主动地找代表谈心事、向政府提出建设性的意见和要求；而代表们也用个别访问、小型座谈会等方式，积极在选民中征求提案，以便带到将要召开的第一次区人民代表大会上去。岱宗街选区人民代表李振江（工人，十八岁）当选后，办事更加积极、认真，居民们反映：“咱算是选对了！”焦绍斌是后宰门街选区的人民代表，他在雨天的黑夜，不顾雨淋、道路难走，到贫苦居民家里察看房屋，以免发生意外。历山顶选区的人民代表周芳庆（女），一向被群众称为“办事积极认真，心眼好”的街道干部，她在当选为人民代表以后，征求群众意见更积极、耐心。人民代表雷万友（回民）这几天，几乎走遍了住在二区的一百余户回民的住宅，广泛征求提案。据区选举委员会自七月十四日到十七日的统计，已收到各阶层人民群众的提案达两千零八十二件，其中以要求加强市政建设的提案为最多。
    在这期间，市人民政府委派局长级干部五人率领二十余名干部协同人民代表、普选工作组的人员，深入工厂、商店和住宅，听取和征询群众的意见和要求。三十四个选区都还专设有意见箱。现在，人民所提出的议案，有的已经获得解决。天地坛街附近的居民提出修挖下水道的要求后，陈梅川副市长曾亲自前往查看。汇泉寺街一贯欺压居民的恶霸分子蒋荣之，这次在人民的检举下，人民政府在查清事实后，立即将他拘押审讯。第二和第三派出所居民们所提出的议案，已解决了三十多件，群众反映良好，进一步启发和提高了群众的政治积极性和当家作主的思想。
    在人民所提出的议案中，有四件是带有全市性的较大的议案。在市人民政府直接协助主持下，经过多次研究，已提出初步处理意见，不久就可以得到合理解决。目前，全区所收到的两千多件提案，除已解决者外，其余的正转有关机关调查并提出处理意见，以便切实解决。这几天，凡是接到提案的机关单位，都立即派干部进行调查研究，并征求群众的意见，以便妥善办理，满足人民群众的要求。（丁秀生）
    宁夏省现正集中力量做好普选试办工作
    宁夏省普选工作原计划从六月开始，可是六月间正当黄河水位降低，渠水小，水田灌水成了问题，而山地又闹旱灾。这样，领导灌溉和防旱救灾工作，便成了当时的紧急任务。同时，在六月以后，又赶上农忙季节，夏收夏选等生产工作和防旱救灾工作仍须要加强领导。所以，普选工作除了在中宁县、阿拉善旗和额济纳旗两牧区从六月开始试办外，其余各地普选工作一律推迟到十月以后举行。
    为了做好中宁试办工作，省选举委员会已把省里原来派到中卫、金积、灵武、吴忠四县市的选举工作干部，全部调到中宁，并抽调省级科长级干部进行巡回检查。当中宁选举工作第二阶段开始时，各县并抽调普选工作干部到中宁参加试办工作，以便吸收和推广经验，为全省选举工作做好基础。
    北京市各普选试办区已提出正式的代表候选人名单
    北京市各普选试办区已先后提出了正式的代表候选人名单。各选区目前正根据这个名单，准备或正在进行庄严的选举。
    自六月底各普选试办区公布选民名单后，选举工作就进入代表候选人提名阶段。代表候选人的提名是由各民主党派、人民团体联合协商提出和由群众提出两种办法结合进行。这些从上、下两方面提出的代表候选人名单汇集起来以后，都同时交给各选民小组仔细研究、比较，然后根据选民民主决定，提出正式代表候选人名单。安福胡同试办区选民中包括城市居民、工人、店员、工商业者、文教工作者和少数民族等。中共西单区委员会与各民主党派和人民团体在该区的组织的负责人举行了协商会议，联合提出了区人民代表大会代表候选人名单。其中有产业工人、店员、工商业者、文教工作者、街道居民、少数民族和街道妇女等。除了这个联合提出的候选人名单以外，选民们还提出了七十多个代表候选人。选举委员会把两个代表候选人名单集中起来以后，交给选民一起讨论。
    选民们在讨论候选人名单时，情绪非常热烈。城区安福胡同试办区每个选民小组都开了二次到三次会议，反复地进行了讨论。郊区蔡公庄乡的选民绝大多数都参加了选民小组会，他们实事求是地认真地评比了代表候选人的优缺点。在讨论到现任合作社营业委员会主任赵万贵应不应当选代表时，引起了热烈的争论。大家认为他表面看好像很能干，但是不很负责任，工作没作好，结果还是把他的名字从正式代表候选人名单上取消了。有的代表候选人工作一贯积极，但是因为工作方式方法上有些缺点，选民们便向他们提出诚恳的批评和意见。他们向选民作了深刻的检讨以后，便仍旧获得了选民的信任。最受选民拥护的是那些工作积极、认真，态度好，处处能为群众利益着想的人。蔡公庄乡的民兵队长郭荣海和乡人民政府秘书祁玉和便是这样的好干部，几乎所有的选民小组都推荐他们当区代表候选人。
