Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 16th. (Special Correspondent Jiang Nan) Robertson has become Syngman Rhee's "better friend." This is the result of his half-month of talks with Syngman Rhee.

Robertson returned to Washington yesterday and reported to Eisenhower and Dulles on his talks with Syngman Rhee. Because Robertson had done many things to condone and encourage Syngman Rhee to sabotage the armistice, he was highly praised by Dulles. Robertson himself was smug and said in his statement yesterday that he was a friend of Syngman Rhee when he went, but he became Syngman Rhee's "better friend" when he returned. He also boasted to American reporters about the farewell scene arranged for him by Syngman Rhee when he left Korea and complained that the United States had not "publicized" this matter.

People do not doubt the "friendship" between Robertson and Syngman Rhee. What people are concerned about is whether Robertson has made Syngman Rhee agree to abide by the armistice agreement, so that the armistice can be realized as soon as possible.

On this point, Robertson's statement, like his joint statement with Syngman Rhee, was vague. However, this ambiguous approach failed to conceal the truth.

Robertson said that he and Syngman Rhee had reached "a wide range of agreements." The words sound very nice, but people have heard a lot about the agreements between Robertson and Syngman Rhee. These agreements, from military alliances, military and economic assistance, expansion of the Rhee puppet army, to withdrawing from the political conference after ninety days, include everything that can increase Syngman Rhee's capital to sabotage the armistice. The only thing missing is an agreement on Syngman Rhee strictly abiding by the armistice agreement.

Robertson himself admitted that this agreement did not exist. He said that Syngman Rhee "has not changed his attitude towards the unification of Korea, but he agreed to cooperate with us and try to achieve unification by peaceful means." People have already learned about this so-called "peaceful method," which is that the United States and Syngman Rhee take a consistent stance at the political conference, attempting to force other countries to accept the unreasonable demands of the U.S. and Rhee's conspiracy to sabotage the political conference. If the "trial" fails, then withdraw from the political conference together and "take all actions required by the situation" to achieve the "common goal" of the United States and Syngman Rhee's "unified Korea." Syngman Rhee has asserted that the political conference will never satisfy him. His so-called "wait and see for ninety days" is just an excuse for him to prepare to sabotage the armistice.

It can be seen that the reason why Robertson became Syngman Rhee's "better friend" is entirely because he encouraged Syngman Rhee to sabotage the armistice without requiring Syngman Rhee to strictly abide by the armistice agreement. To prove the "friendship" between him and Syngman Rhee, Robertson told American reporters that Syngman Rhee had given him and Dulles many gifts, but he dared not say at the same time that he had given Syngman Rhee the money of American taxpayers and the lives of a large number of American youths, which were many times more valuable than Syngman Rhee's gifts.

### 美国多方纵容了李承晚破坏停战  罗伯逊回国后承认美李关系更加密切

    美国多方纵容了李承晚破坏停战
    罗伯逊回国后承认美李关系更加密切
    【新华社开城十六日电】  本社特派记者江南报道：罗伯逊已经成了李承晚的“更好的朋友”，这就是他和李承晚半个多月会谈的结果。
    罗伯逊在昨天回到华盛顿，并且向艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯报告了他和李承晚会谈的经过。罗伯逊由于在纵容和鼓励李承晚破坏停战方面做了许多事情，所以受到了杜勒斯的极口称赞。而罗伯逊自己也沾沾自喜地在他昨天发表的声明中说，他去的时候是李承晚的朋友，回来时却成了李承晚的“更好的朋友”。他还向美国记者们夸耀他离开朝鲜时李承晚给他安排的欢送场面，并且埋怨美国国内没有给他把这件事情“大肆宣扬”一番。
    人们对于罗伯逊和李承晚之间的“友谊”并不怀疑，人们关心的是罗伯逊究竟是不是已经使李承晚同意遵守停战协定，从而使停战得以早日实现。
    关于这一点，罗伯逊的声明也像他和李承晚的联合声明一样说得含含糊糊。但是，这种含糊其词的办法并没有能够瞒住事情的真相。
    罗伯逊说，他和李承晚已经“有了很大范围的协议”。话是说得很好听，可是，关于罗伯逊和李承晚之间的协议，人们已经听说得很多了。这些协议，从军事同盟，军事和经济援助，扩充李伪军，一直到九十天以后退出政治会议，凡是足以使李承晚增加破坏停战的本钱的东西，包罗万象，什么都有了，独独缺少的是关于李承晚严格遵守停战协定的协议。
    罗伯逊自己承认，这种协议是没有的。他说，李承晚“对于统一朝鲜的态度并没有改变，可是他同意与我们合作，试用和平的方法来达到统一”。这种“试用”的所谓“和平的方法”，人们也已经领教过了，这就是美国和李承晚在政治会议上采取一致态度，企图在政治会议上强使其他国家接受美李破坏政治会议的预谋的无理主张。如果“试用”不成，那就一起退出政治会议，并“采取局势所需要的一切行动”，来达到美国和李承晚的“统一朝鲜”的“共同目标”。李承晚已经断言政治会议是绝不会使他满意的。他的所谓“等九十天瞧”只不过是为他准备破坏停战制造藉口而已。
    由此可见，罗伯逊之所以成为李承晚的“更好的朋友”，完全是因为他鼓励了李承晚破坏停战而没有要求李承晚严格遵守停战协定。为了证明他和李承晚之间的“友谊”，罗伯逊告诉美国记者们说，李承晚送了许多礼物给他和杜勒斯，可是他不敢同时说出这样的事实，即：他已经把比李承晚的礼物贵得不知多少倍的美国纳税人的钱和大批美国青年的性命，当作礼物送给了李承晚。
