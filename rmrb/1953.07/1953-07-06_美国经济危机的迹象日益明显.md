Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd: TASS reports that American newspapers and prominent representatives of the business community are deeply disturbed by the increasingly evident signs of an economic crisis beginning in the latter half of 1953.

According to official figures from the Federal Reserve Board, despite military production remaining at a high level, American industrial production is gradually shrinking. The Board states that the production of household goods, automobiles, trucks, televisions, and construction materials has decreased. Residential construction is declining. Newspapers have openly expressed concern that in the near future, due to the inability to sell goods, production in major American industrial sectors will sharply contract.

According to the Department of Commerce, the United States has accumulated a large amount of "inventory," reaching an unprecedented level of $76 billion. The prominent American business magazine "Standard" points out that such a large inventory may trigger a "new downward trend in business activity." The increasing inventory of unsold automobiles has already forced the automotive industry to slow down production. The "Chicago Federal Reserve Bank Monthly Review" predicts that employment in the automotive industry's production sector will significantly decrease in the coming months.

What worries American entrepreneurs, particularly prominent financiers like Tang Shande, is the unprecedented increase in so-called "consumer credit," which largely artificially sustains the consumer market. By April of this year, the total amount of "consumer credit" had increased from $5.6 billion in 1945 to $26.1 billion.

Signs of a crisis are also emerging in American agriculture. This is manifested in the continuous decline in agricultural product prices, reduced farmer income, the accumulation of large quantities of unsold "surplus products," and increased farmer debt, among other factors. Financier Tang Shande recently had to admit at the Bankers' Convention in Lake Placid (New York State) that the prospects for American economic development "are doubtful in the last six months and very bleak in the coming year."

### 美国经济危机的迹象日益明显

    美国经济危机的迹象日益明显
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社纽约二日讯：美国报纸与企业界著名的代表人物对于在一九五三年下半年开始时表现日益明显的经济危机的迹象感到十分不安。
    根据联邦储备局的官方数字，尽管军事生产仍然维持很高的水平，美国工业生产日渐萎缩。据该局说，家庭用品，汽车，卡车，电视与建筑器材的生产都已经减少。住宅建筑在下降。报纸已公开表示忧虑，认为在不久的将来，由于无法销售商品，美国主要工业部门的生产将会急剧萎缩。
    根据商务部的材料，美国积压了大量“存货”，达七百六十亿美元的空前未有的水平。美国企业界著名的“标准”杂志指出：这样庞大的存货可能引起“企业活动新的下降趋势”。卖不出去的汽车的存货不断增加，已经迫使汽车工业生产速度放慢。“芝加哥联邦储备银行月刊”预言，在最近几个月内，汽车工业生产部门的就业率将会大大下降。
    美国企业家，特别是著名的金融家唐山德十分忧虑的是：在很大程度上是以人工维持消费市场的所谓“消费者信用”空前增加了。到本年四月为止，“消费者信用”总数已从一九四五年的五十六亿美元增至二百六十一亿美元。
    美国农业也出现危机的迹象。这表现在农产品价格不断下降，农民收入减少，积压大量卖不出去的“过剩品”和农民负债增加等等方面。金融家唐山德最近在普拉塞德湖（纽约州）银行家大会上不得不承认，美国经济发展的前景“在最近的六个月内是值得怀疑的，在明年则是十分黯淡的。”
