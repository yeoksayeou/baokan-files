Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. According to Vietnam News Agency: The "Salvation News" recently published an article describing how the people in the enemy-controlled areas of Hà Đông Province, North Vietnam, frustrated the French army's conspiracy to create no-man's lands.

	Hà Đông Province is adjacent to Hanoi. In addition to heavily defending this area, the French army frequently created and expanded no-man's lands here. In 1951, the French army created two new no-man's lands in Hà Đông Province. They burned or killed farmhouses, farm tools, and livestock, rendering one-third of the rice fields in Hà Đông Province's summer rice area—more than 12,000 hectares—completely barren.

	In order to thwart the French army's atrocities in creating no-man's lands, the local people's government organized farmers to return to the no-man's lands to struggle and persist in production. Guerrilla teams established observation posts to protect farmers as they worked in the fields. Farmers dug shelters in the fields to prevent French artillery shelling. In this way, farmers in My Duc district alone planted more than 1,400 hectares of rice.

	In 1952, thanks to the people's government's transfer of some farmers from densely populated areas to areas with labor shortages, as well as the guerrillas' repelling of multiple attacks by the French army, the people of Hà Đông Province completely harvested both the summer and autumn crops, and the harvest period was even ten days earlier than in previous years. Now, Hà Đông Province has eliminated part of the no-man's lands created by the enemy and expanded the guerrilla areas.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Saigon dispatch: According to the French army's high command in Vietnam, collective desertions have been occurring frequently recently in the Vietnamese puppet troops stationed in southern Vietnam.

	The Saigon French military headquarters announced on June 25 that a total of 500 Hòa Hảo sect puppet troops stationed in Cai Lậy and Tho Nor, southwest of Saigon, collectively "escaped" with their weapons on the night of June 25. Before escaping, the puppet troops in Cai Lậy burned down several strongholds and guard posts they were defending. According to the Associated Press, the escape "was due to dissatisfaction with the reduction of salaries and delayed payments to Hòa Hảo soldiers."

	Prior to this, according to a news released by the French military headquarters on June 21, on the night of June 19 in Biên Hòa province, north of Saigon, one hundred "loyal" Bảo Đại troops "escaped" after killing their commander and fourteen other officers. These soldiers took away all their weapons and equipment.

    粉碎法军制造无人区的罪恶行为
    越南南部的伪军集体逃亡事件接连发生
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社讯：“救国报”最近刊登一篇文章，叙述北越河东省敌后地区人民粉碎法军制造无人区的阴谋的情形。
    河东省邻接河内。法军除了在这个地区重兵设防外，还经常在这里制造和扩大无人区。一九五一年，法军在河东省又制造了两个新的无人区。他们将农舍、农具和耕畜烧光或杀光，使这一年河东省夏稻区的三分之一的稻田——一万二千多公顷完全荒芜。
    为了粉碎法军制造无人区的暴行，当地人民政权组织农民回到无人区进行斗争，坚持生产。游击队建立起了望哨，掩护农民下地生产。农民在田里挖掘隐敝所，防备法军炮轰。这样，仅美德县农民就种上了一千四百多公顷的水稻。
    一九五二年，由于人民政权从人口稠密的地区调剂一些农民到人力少的地区，以及游击队击退法军的多次袭击，河东省人民完全收到夏、秋两季的庄稼，收获期还比往年早十天。现在，河东省已经消灭了敌人制造的一部分无人区，扩大了游击区。
    【新华社三日讯】西贡消息：据侵越法军总司令部透露，驻守在越南南部的越南傀儡部队，最近接连发生集体的逃亡事情。
    西贡法军总部六月二十五日宣布，分别驻扎在西贡西南的丐冷和托诺两地的和好教伪军共五百人，在六月二十五日晚，携带武器集体“逃跑”。丐冷的伪军在逃跑前，将他们防守的若干据点和岗楼烧掉。据美联社透露，逃跑“是由于对减少和好教士兵的薪饷和延期发饷的不满”。
    在此以前，据法军总部在六月二十一日宣布的消息说，六月十九日夜间在西贡北面的边和省，有一百名“忠诚的”保大军队在杀死他们的指挥官和其他十四名军官后“逃跑”。这些士兵带走了他们的全部武器和装备。
