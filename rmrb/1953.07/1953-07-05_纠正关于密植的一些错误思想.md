Correcting Some Erroneous Ideas About Close Planting

Close planting is an advanced planting method that some farmers in our country have practiced in the past, and it is also an effective way to increase production currently. However, because many people lack a correct understanding of close planting, many deviations have occurred in the past work of promoting close planting, directly or indirectly causing losses to the masses. Currently, various localities are carrying out the work of thinning early autumn crops and sowing late autumn crops. In order to do a better job of thinning and sowing, rural work cadres should have a correct understanding of close planting in order to avoid continuing to make mistakes on this issue.

What is close planting? Its significance is: first, appropriately increase the total number of plants per unit area, and ensure full emergence, in order to make full use of soil fertility; second, spread out the distance between plants, and ensure equal spacing, so that seedlings develop evenly and healthily. The level of yield per unit area depends on the one hand on the number of plants planted per unit area, and on the other hand on the quality of growth and development of each seedling. If the total number of plants per mu increases, and each plant grows neatly and strongly, production will inevitably increase. This is the basic principle by which close planting can increase production, and it is also the basic principle for implementing close planting.

At present, there are still many people in our country who have some incorrect views on close planting, so that this advanced experience cannot play its due role.

Some people do not understand that close planting has a certain limit. They mistakenly believe that the denser the better, and increase the amount of seeds sown or the number of seedlings transplanted without limit when planting crops. Some people only know to increase the total number of plants, but do not know to spread out the distance between plants, so that rice close planting becomes "dense planting of large clumps," and wheat close planting becomes "dense sowing in large ridges," which prevents each seedling from obtaining a certain amount of nutrition. Such one-sided and unreasonable close planting not only fails to achieve the purpose of increasing production, but may also cause dangers such as crop lodging.

Some people understand "close planting" one-sidedly from its literal meaning, thinking that close planting means planting crops closely together; they do not understand that close planting includes two inseparable contents: increasing the total number of plants per mu and spreading out the distance between plants. Therefore, they worry that poor ventilation and light transmission after close planting will make crops prone to lodging and disease, and often use the facts of lodging caused by blind fertilization and blind close planting to oppose close planting. In fact, reasonable close planting, in terms of the total number of plants in a certain field, the density is increased; but in terms of each plant, a certain distance is maintained, so it is more conducive to ventilation and light transmission, making crops develop strongly, and less prone to lodging and disease. The results of the wheat close planting experiment in Shijiazhuang Farm, Hebei Province this year prove that: narrow-row close planting has more roots, stronger stalks, and slight lodging (for example, with 310,000 grains sown per mu and a row spacing of 4.5 inches, only 2.5% lodged); large-ridge sparse planting has fewer roots, weaker stalks, and a lot of lodging (for example, with 260,000 grains sown per mu and a row spacing of 9 inches, 83.7% lodged).

Some people propose that the implementation of close planting must have a certain material foundation and technical conditions. In principle, this is correct. To implement a high degree of close planting, it is necessary to simultaneously implement a series of advanced technologies such as deep plowing, appropriate fertilization, rational irrigation, and the selection of fertilizer-resistant varieties. However, this does not mean that close planting cannot be appropriately implemented on the existing basis. Because the "density" of close planting is relative, not absolute. In some areas, the number of plants per unit area is too small, and there is a lot of waste of soil fertility, so the number of plants can be appropriately increased. In some areas, although the number of plants per unit area is not small, the rows are wide and the ridges are large, and the planting is uneven and sparse; in this case, the spacing between plants and rows can be appropriately adjusted to make the plants evenly dispersed. Judging from the current situation of food crop planting in various parts of our country, the general problem is insufficient density, a large number of missing plants and seedlings, and inappropriate spacing between plants and rows, which is a major factor limiting the increase in yield. Soviet expert Lysenko discovered this problem as early as 1949 and introduced the advanced experience of close planting in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, the row spacing for planting rice is generally 15 cm (about 4.6 inches), and each mu must ensure 166,000 to 200,000 actual ears. In the main rice-producing areas of our country, due to the adoption of "large-clump sparse planting" (the row and hole spacing reaches about one foot, and more than ten seedlings are transplanted per hole), each mu generally yields less than 100,000 ears. In the Soviet Union, the row spacing for planting wheat is 15 cm, and recently they have promoted 7.5 cm (about 2.3 inches) narrow-row sowing; the amount of seeds sown per mu ranges from 267,000 to 350,000 grains (approximately 17 to 24 jin). In our country, wheat is generally planted in "wide rows and large ridges," with the narrowest row spacing being 6 or 7 inches, and the widest reaching 1.5 feet, and the amount of seeds sown per mu is generally only 8 to 12 jin. Due to the small amount of seeds sown, the total number of plants per mu is reduced; although the amount of seeds sown is small, the row spacing is wide, and the seeds are concentrated on the row, they are still crowded. In the Soviet Union, coarse grains are not closely planted in principle, but for example, corn has recently adopted a square planting method, and the number of seedlings retained per mu has reached 3,000; the number of seedlings retained per mu of millet is generally more than 44,000. In our country, the number of seedlings retained per mu of horse-tooth corn is generally no more than 1,000, and the number of seedlings retained per mu of millet is generally no more than 20,000, and less than 10,000 in some cases. In comparison, the planting density of coarse grains in our country is also insufficient. Of course, the Soviet Union's implementation of a high degree of close planting is based on the comprehensive development of highly advanced agricultural science and technology, and we cannot mechanically implement a high degree of close planting according to their standards. However, according to the continuous improvement of our country's cultivation level, it is possible and necessary to gradually and appropriately implement close planting to improve the yield per unit area of food crops. It is very necessary to carefully summarize the existing experience of the masses and prepare ideological conditions for the promotion of close planting.

Some cadres in some areas one-sidedly believe that close planting is a foreign or external experience and cannot be promoted locally. Actually, this is not the case. In any region, down to a township or village, the density of planting crops is not completely consistent, and there are relatively reasonable densities and relatively unreasonable densities. Therefore, each region can find a relatively reasonable planting density in the local area and summarize the experience of relatively close planting to increase production. Promoting these experiences locally is actually a preliminary promotion of close planting. Rejecting the method of close planting from a long distance is actually a manifestation of ignoring the existing experience of the local masses in close planting to increase production.

In different regions, for different crops, for different varieties, and under different cultivation conditions, how dense should it be? How many plants should be planted per mu, and what is the most suitable spacing between plants and rows? The answers should be found by summarizing the local people’s experience. In promoting close planting, the method of taking materials locally and promoting them locally should be used. Ignoring the specific conditions of the local area, blindly copying methods from other places, and forcing the masses to accept them, will not only fail to achieve the goal of truly promoting close planting, but may also cause losses to the masses. In particular, crops such as corn that require intertillage are very sensitive to the size of the nutrient area, and blind close planting is even more dangerous. In 1950, Shandong promoted Golden Queen corn without doing a good job of technical guidance. Some people planted more than 3,000 plants per mu according to the local corn planting method, resulting in only long stalks and no ears. We should remember this lesson.

    纠正关于密植的一些错误思想
    密植是我国部分农民过去就曾实行的先进的种植方法，也是当前行之有效的增产办法。但是，由于不少人对密植还缺乏正确的认识，在以往推行密植的工作中发生了不少的偏向，直接间接使群众遭受了损失。现在各地正在进行早秋作物间苗和晚秋作物播种的工作。为了把间苗、播种工作做得更好，农村工作干部对于密植应当有一个正确的认识，以避免在这个问题上继续发生错误。
    什么叫密植？它的意义是：第一、适当增加单位面积总株数，并作到全苗，以充分利用地力；第二、疏散株与株间的距离，并作到等距，使禾苗发育均衡健壮。单位面积产量的高低，一方面决定于单位面积内种植株数的多少，一方面又决定于每一棵禾苗发育生长的好坏。如果每亩的总株数增多，每一株又都长得整齐健壮，必然增加产量。这是密植可以增产的基本道理，也是实行密植的基本原则。
    目前，我国还有不少人对密植有一些错误的看法，因而使这一先进经验还不能发挥应有的作用。
    有些人不了解密植是有一定限度的。他们错误地认为密了便好，越密越好，就在种植作物时，无限制地增加播种量或插植株数。有些人只知道增加总株数，不知道疏散株与株的距离，就使水稻密植成了“大株密植”，小麦密植成了“大垅密播”，结果不能使每一棵禾苗得到一定的营养。这样片面的不合理的密植，不但不能达到增产的目的，并且可能引起作物倒伏等危险。
    有些人片面地从字义上来理解“密植”，以为密植便是把作物密密地种在一块；他们不了解密植包括增加每亩的总株数和疏散株与株间的距离两个不可分的内容。因此，他们担心密植后通风透光不好，作物容易倒伏和发生病害，并常常用一些由于盲目施肥、盲目密植所引起的倒伏的事实来反对密植。其实，合理的密植，从一定田亩中的总株数来说，密度是增加了；但从各株之间来说，却保持了一定距离，因此更利于通风透光，使作物发育健壮，更不易倒伏和发生病害。今年河北省石家庄农场小麦密植试验结果证明：窄行密植的根多、秆健、倒伏轻微（如，每亩播种三十一万粒、行距四点五寸的，倒伏的仅百分之二点五）；大垅稀植的根少、秆弱、倒伏的很多（如，每亩种二十六万粒、行距九寸的，倒伏的有百分之八十三点七）。
    有些人提出：实行密植必须具备一定物质基础和技术条件。从原则上说这是对的。要实行高度的密植，必须同时实行深耕、适度施肥、合理灌溉、选用耐肥品种等一系列的先进技术。但是，这并不是说，在现有基础上就不能适当地实行密植。因为所谓密植的“密”是相对的，不是绝对的。有的地区单位面积上株数太少，地力有很多浪费，就可以适当增加株数。有的地区单位面积上的株数虽不少，但是宽行大垅，大株稀植，播种不匀，稀稠不齐；在这种情况下，就可以适当调整株行距，使株与株之间均匀疏散。就我国目前各地粮食作物种植的情况来看，一般的是密度不足，缺株缺苗很多，株行距不适当，这是限制产量提高的重大因素。苏联专家卢森科早在一九四九年就发现了这一问题，并介绍了苏联密植的先进经验。苏联种植水稻，一般行距是十五公分（约四点六寸），每亩要保证有实穗十六万六千个至二十万个。我国主要水稻产区，由于采用“大株稀植”（行距穴距达到一尺左右，每穴插秧十株以上），每亩结实穗一般不到十万个。苏联种麦，行距十五公分，近来更推行七点五公分（约二点三寸）窄行播种；每亩播种量自二十六万七千粒至三十五万粒（约合十七斤至二十四斤）。我国种麦一般都是“宽行大垅”，行距最窄的也有六、七寸，宽的达到一尺五寸，每亩一般只下种八至十二斤。由于播种量少，便减少了每亩总株数；播种量虽少，但由于行距宽，种子集中行上，仍嫌密挤。杂粮在苏联原则上是不密植的，但例如玉米，近年来采用方形种植法，每亩留苗也达到了三千株；谷子（小米）每亩留苗一般也在四万四千株以上。而我国马牙玉米每亩留苗一般不过一千株，谷子（小米）每亩留苗一般不过二万株，少的在一万株以下。比较之下，我国杂粮种植密度也是不够的。当然，苏联实行高度密植是有全面发展的高度农业科学技术作基础的，我们不能机械地按照他们的标准实行高度密植。但是，根据我国耕作水平不断提高的情况，逐步地、适当地实行密植以提高粮食作物的单位面积产量，却是可能和必要的。好好总结群众中已有的经验，为推广密植准备思想条件，是十分必要的。
    有些地区的干部片面地认为密植是外国或外地的经验，不能在当地推广。实际上不是这样的。任何一个地区，小至一乡一村，种植作物的密度都不是完全一致的，都有比较合理的，也有比较不合理的。因此每一地区都可能在当地找出比较合理的种植密度，总结出相对的密植增产的经验。就地推广这些经验，实际上就是初步推广密植。把密植的办法拒之于千里之外，实际上正是忽略当地群众已有的密植增产经验的一种表现。
    不同地区、不同作物、不同品种，在不同的耕作条件下，要密到什么程度？每亩栽多少株、株行距多远最合适？都应该从总结当地群众经验中找到答案。在推广密植工作中，应该用就地取材、就地推广的办法。不考虑当地具体情况，硬搬别地办法，强迫群众接受，不但不能达到真正推广的目的，并且可能使群众遭受损失。特别是玉米等需要中耕的作物，对营养面积的大小的反应十分敏锐，盲目密植，危险更大。一九五○年山东推广金皇后玉米，没有做好技术指导，有些群众按照当地玉米种植办法，每亩密植三千多株，结果光长秆，不结穗。我们应该记取这个教训。
