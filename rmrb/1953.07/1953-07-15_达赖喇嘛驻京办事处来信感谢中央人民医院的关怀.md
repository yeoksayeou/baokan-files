    Letter from the Dalai Lama's Beijing Office Thanking the Central People's Hospital for Their Care
    The Dalai Lama's Beijing Office writes: Comrade Gejieba from our office fell ill this spring. By April 7th, he was bedridden, coughing incessantly, experiencing extreme difficulty breathing, unable to sleep day or night, and losing weight significantly, putting his life in great danger. After examining his condition, the Central People's Hospital immediately made room for him to be hospitalized, even though the hospital was very crowded. Two days later, in order to better accommodate the habits of ethnic minorities, the hospital also vacated a single room for him to recuperate quietly. The hospital took very good care of him: in terms of diet, they tried their best to meet the living habits of our ethnic minority; during medical treatment, although communication was time-consuming due to language barriers and translation, the doctors always carefully and patiently asked questions repeatedly during each examination; the nurses also sincerely cared for and looked after him like sisters, always worried that the patient might be too hot or too cold, and prepared three or four sets of hospital clothes for the patient to change at any time, so that he would be comfortable whether he was hot or cold. Under such medical care and nursing, Comrade Gejieba's condition turned from critical to stable, and he gradually recovered his health. On June 22nd, he returned to his job with great joy.
    Not only that, but because our Tibetan comrades from the office were not used to the life in the interior when they first arrived, they often became ill. The Central People's Hospital has always given special attention and convenience to our ethnic minority compatriots when they go to register for medical treatment. Therefore, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Central People's Hospital here.
    These facts cannot but remind us of the environment and status of our ethnic minority people in the old society. In the past, what we received was nothing but oppression, discrimination, and insult. Only in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can our ethnic minority people receive such care and attention, enjoy the rights of national equality, and can there be such harmony, unity, and friendship among the people of all ethnic groups. Therefore, we feel even more deeply the loveliness of our great motherland – a big family of harmony, unity, friendship, and cooperation among all ethnic groups.

### 达赖喇嘛驻京办事处来信感谢中央人民医院的关怀

专栏：读者来信摘要

    达赖喇嘛驻京办事处来信感谢中央人民医院的关怀
    达赖喇嘛驻京办事处来信：我处格结巴同志在今春患了病。到四月七日，他卧床不起，咳嗽不止，呼吸极端困难，昼夜不眠，体重显著下降，生命十分危险。中央人民医院检查了他的病情后，立即在病员非常拥挤的情况下，腾出床位让他住院治疗。两天后，该院为了更好地照顾少数民族的习惯，又腾出单间病房，让他安静调养。该院对他的照顾非常周到：在饮食方面尽可能做到符合我们少数民族的生活习惯；医疗时虽因语言不通，翻译很费时间，但是大夫每次检查病情，总是认真、耐心地反复询问；护士同志们也诚挚地，像亲姊妹一样地时刻关怀和照顾着他，她们唯恐病人热冷不均，随时都准备着三、四套病服让病人更换，使他冷暖舒适。格结巴同志在这样的医疗和护理下，病情转危为安，逐渐恢复了健康，于六月二十二日满怀愉快的心情，回到了自己的工作岗位。
    不仅如此，我处藏族工作同志因为初到内地，生活不习惯，经常闹病。中央人民医院在我们少数民族同胞前往挂号就诊时，一向都特别加以照顾，给予方便。因此，我们在这里谨向中央人民医院致以衷心的感谢。
    以上这些事实，不能不使我们回想起我们少数民族人民在旧社会里所处的环境和地位。以前我们所受到的，除了压迫、歧视和侮辱以外，别无其他。只有在中国共产党领导下的新中国，我们少数民族人民才能受到这样的关怀和照顾，才能享受民族平等的权利，各民族人民间才能这样和睦、团结和友爱。因此我们更加感到伟大祖国——各民族和睦团结、友爱合作的大家庭的可爱。
