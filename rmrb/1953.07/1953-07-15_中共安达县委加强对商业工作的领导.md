    The CPC Anda County Committee Strengthens Leadership over Commercial Work
    Heilongjiang Provincial Commercial Department of the CPC Committee
    In the past, the CPC Anda County Committee did not pay enough attention to commercial work, mostly conducting general leadership, and passively dealing with problems only after they arose. The County Committee saw the serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and ideological confusion among staff in the state-owned commercial and cooperative systems exposed during the "Three-Anti" campaign and deeply felt the need to strengthen the Party's leadership over the work of state-owned commerce and cooperatives. After the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CPC convened commercial meetings, the County Committee further clarified the consistency between doing a good job in commercial and supply and marketing work and doing a good job in production work. Therefore, in addition to strengthening leadership over agricultural production, it also strengthened leadership over state-owned commerce and cooperatives. From the fourth quarter of last year to the present, the county's state-owned commerce and cooperatives have overfulfilled the procurement and sales plans every quarter and every month. Their experience is:

    1.  Conscientiously implement the Party's principles and policies for commerce and cooperatives, regularly check the implementation of principles and policies, and correct deviations in a timely manner. The CPC Anda County Committee conducted a serious discussion and study of the spirit of the Northeast Bureau and the Provincial Committee's commercial meetings. Based on the actual conditions of the county, it formulated a specific implementation plan, convened a meeting of leading cadres of state-owned commerce and cooperatives to convey it, and organized employees to discuss it. At the beginning of the inventory and accounting work in the first quarter of this year, the County Committee emphasized carrying out ideological mobilization work and formed working groups to go deep into grassroots stores to provide specific assistance. At that time, in light of the actual situation, a meeting of cadres above the level of section chief of various specialized companies was convened to criticize the idea and practice of simply conducting inventory and accounting while neglecting the expansion of sales. It emphasized the implementation of the spirit of the Northeast Bureau and the Provincial Committee's commercial meetings, which called for carrying out asset inventory and verification on the basis of expanding sales and ensuring market supply. Therefore, the daily operations of each company were not affected during the inventory and accounting work in the first quarter. Because the bank had overemphasized currency withdrawal, the state-owned commercial departments blindly believed that the inventory was too large, and for a time there was a phenomenon of simply emphasizing the compression of inventory. The County Committee helped these units to carefully calculate the accounts, criticized the idea of blindly pursuing the acceleration of capital turnover and not actively organizing purchases according to the needs of the people, and implemented the policy of rationally reducing inventory on the basis of ensuring supply, which avoided the occurrence of stockouts of major commodities.

    2.  Go deep into the grassroots to provide specific assistance, strengthen political work in the state-owned commercial and cooperative systems, and improve the leadership level of state-owned commercial and cooperative work. After the Northeast Bureau and the Provincial Committee's commercial meetings, the County Committee designated Liu Changlin, a member of the County Committee, to be responsible for commercial work, and established a commercial research group in the County Committee Office, drawing the district chief of the urban area as the leader. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Committee, general Party and Youth League branches were organized in enterprises, with full-time cadres assigned. Each specialized company and cooperative was equipped with political vice-leaders and full-time Party branch secretaries. Incompetent cadres in the cooperative sector were also appropriately adjusted. Liu Changlin often went deep into various specialized companies, cooperatives, and banks to understand the situation, convene meetings of middle-level cadres, help study leadership methods, and help solve ideological problems. The newly equipped director of the County Federation of Cooperatives and most of the newly promoted section chiefs lacked leadership experience. The County Committee convened a meeting to study the issue and helped them improve their leadership and overcome the work style of focusing on routine matters. The County Committee often convened symposiums of store group leaders and shop assistant representatives to help them overcome difficulties in their work and encourage everyone to improve their work morale. The shop assistants reflected, "In the past, people only said that commercial work was important, but the Party Committee didn't come often, and only managed things during campaigns. Now it's different." The County Committee also specifically convened a meeting of political vice-leaders and Party branch secretaries from the commercial, cooperative, grain, and banking departments to study and exchange experiences in doing political work well, and corrected the deviation of conducting political work in isolation without combining it with business. Because the County Committee strengthened its leadership over political work in the commercial system, it basically overcame the mercenary views, the idea of belittling commercial work, and the irresponsible thinking and work style towards state property that once existed among employees and shop assistants. The enthusiasm of the staff was improved. In the past, 18 percent of the employees in the department store system had the idea of "do as much as you are paid," but now many people have become model workers. The attitude of shop assistants towards customers has also changed from "take it or leave it" to actively going to factories, government offices, and schools to understand the needs of the masses and actively providing supplies.

    3.  Go deep into the work process and focus on improving the basic links of commercial work. After the commercial meetings, the County Committee realized that improving plan management was a prerequisite for implementing the economic accounting system, so it focused on this work. Before formulating the plan, the County Committee member in charge of commercial work personally reported to all employees, explaining the importance of correctly formulating the plan, criticizing the irresponsible practices, emphasizing the democratic formulation of the plan, and designating the County Finance and Economics Committee to cooperate with relevant departments to conduct surveys of purchasing power in various strata. Each specialized company looked for past historical materials as the basis for preparing the plan, then organized cadres to study and conduct democratic discussions to formulate the plan. During the implementation of the plan, the County Committee's commercial research group constantly went deep into grassroots stores to supervise and inspect the implementation of the plan, check the source of goods, and solve problems in a timely manner. In the first quarter, it was discovered that more than a dozen types of cloth would be out of stock within five days if goods were not replenished, but according to the purchase plan, it would take ten days to replenish them. The County Committee ordered the Industry and Commerce Section to immediately study this situation and send capable cadres to the wholesale station to organize the replenishment of goods in advance, ensuring the supply.

    4.  Pay attention to the mutual cooperation of various departments and close the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives. In the past, the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives was not coordinated enough. After the commercial meetings, due to the unified leadership of the County Committee, attention was paid to the cooperation between the relevant departments, emphasis was placed on starting from work and from meeting the needs of the people, good examples were commended, and bad phenomena were criticized, so that the cadres of state-owned commerce clearly recognized the principle that "to complete the plan, we must rely on the cooperatives." Since then, their attitude towards the cooperatives has been to provide as much convenience as possible. In order not to delay the grassroots cooperatives from receiving goods, the shop assistants took turns resting on Sundays or holidays. The director of the wholesale department often convened symposiums of village and commune purchasing agents to solicit their opinions and understand the needs of the people. The County Federation of Cooperatives often took the initiative to understand the completion of the plans of the various specialized companies of state-owned commerce, and if it found stagnant goods in state-owned stores, it took the initiative to help with consignment sales and trial sales. In February, the County Committee found that the grain purchase plan of the cooperatives was not completed well, and most of the means of production had not been sold to the farmers. It ordered the various specialized companies, the grain department, and the County Federation of Cooperatives to send more than 50 cadres to go deep into the villages to help the grassroots cooperatives publicize the grain purchase policy and dispel the farmers' ideological concerns, and the purchase and sales plan was completed. The relationship between the bank and state-owned commerce and cooperatives has also become closer. They often take the initiative to go to stores and cooperatives to help study the use of funds and check inventory, and provide the necessary support in terms of funds.

    5.  Strengthen the leadership of the district committees over the work of the cooperatives. At every meeting of the district committee secretaries, the County Committee would arrange to inspect the district committee's leadership over the supply and marketing cooperatives and criticize the practice of not managing the supply and marketing cooperatives. At the People's Representative Conference at all levels and the county's village cadre meeting, the work of the supply and marketing cooperatives was also discussed. Therefore, the vast majority of district and village Party and government cadres in the county care about and have close relations with the work of the supply and marketing cooperatives. For example, when the district committees of the Fourth and Sixth Districts arranged for district cadres to go to the countryside, they included the work of the cooperatives as a task. The district committee secretaries often went to the cooperatives to understand the situation, help solve problems, give reports to the cooperative cadres, and organize everyone to study.

    中共安达县委加强对商业工作的领导
    中共黑龙江省委商业部
    中共黑龙江省安达县委过去对商业工作重视不够，多是进行一般化的领导，出了问题才被动地加以处理。县委看到“三反”运动中暴露的国营商业与合作社系统中存在的贪污、浪费和工作人员思想混乱等严重现象，深深感到必须加强党对国营商业与合作社工作的领导。中共中央东北局、中共黑龙江省委召开商业会议以后，县委更明确了作好商业、供销工作与作好生产工作的一致性，因此，除了加强对农业生产的领导外，同时也加强了对国营商业与合作社的领导。从去年第四季度开始到现在，该县国营商业和合作社每季每月都超额完成了收购和推销计划。他们的经验是：
    一、认真地贯彻党对商业与合作社的方针政策，经常检查方针政策的执行情况，及时纠正偏向。中共安达县委对东北局及省委商业会议的精神作了认真的讨论研究，根据本县实际情况，制订了具体贯彻执行计划，召开国营商业与合作社领导干部会议进行传达，并组织职工讨论。在今年第一季度清库查账工作开始时，县委曾强调进行思想动员工作，并组成工作组，深入基层商店具体加以帮助。当时曾针对实际情况，召开各专业公司股长以上的干部会议，批判了单纯进行清库查账、忽视扩大推销的思想与作法，强调贯彻东北局、省委商业会议提出的在扩大推销、保证市场供应的基础上进行清产核资工作。因此，各公司在第一季度清库查账工作中，没有影响日常业务。由于银行曾过分强调货币回笼，国营商业部门盲目认为库存太大，一度发生单纯强调压缩库存的现象，县委就帮助这些单位算细账，批判了盲目追求加速资金流转，不按人民需要积极组织进货的思想，贯彻了在保证供应的基础上合理地缩小库存的方针，这就避免了主要商品脱销现象的发生。
    二、深入基层具体帮助，加强国营商业与合作社系统中的政治工作，提高国营商业与合作社工作的领导水平。东北局、省委商业会议以后，县委指定了县委委员刘长林负责商业工作，在县委办公室设立了商业研究组，抽调城区区长为组长。为了加强党的领导，按照省委的指示，组织了党和团的企业总支，配备了专职干部，各专业公司、合作社都配齐了政治副职和专职的党支部书记，对合作社部门不称职的干部也作了适当的调整。刘长林经常深入到各专业公司、合作社、银行了解情况，召开中层干部会议，帮助研究领导方法，帮助解决思想问题。县联社新配备的主任和新提拔的大部分科长缺乏领导经验，县委召开会议加以研究，帮助他们改进了领导，克服了事务主义的作风。县委经常召开商店小组长和店员代表座谈会，帮助他们克服工作中的困难，鼓动大家提高工作情绪。店员们反映说：“过去光说商业工作重要，党委可不常来，只是搞运动的时候才管管，现在不同了。”县委还专门召开了商业、合作、粮食、银行等部门政治副职、党支部书记会议，研究和交流做好政治工作的经验，纠正了孤立地进行政治工作不与业务结合的偏向。由于县委加强了对商业系统政治工作的领导，基本上克服了曾在职工店员中间存在着的雇佣观点、轻视商业工作和对国家财产不负责任的思想与作风。工作人员的积极性提高了。百货系统过去有百分之十八的职工存在着“拿多少分，干多少事”的思想，现在好多人变成了工作模范；店员对待顾主的态度也由“爱买不买”转变为主动地下工厂、机关、学校了解群众的需要，积极进行供应。
    三、深入工作过程，抓紧改进商业工作的基本环节。商业会议以后，县委认识到改进计划管理是贯彻经济核算制的前提，就抓紧了这一工作。在制订计划之前，负责商业工作的县委委员亲自向全体职工作报告，说明正确制订计划的重要性，批判了不负责任的作法，强调了民主制订计划，并指定县财经委员会配合有关部门深入各阶层进行购买力的调查；各专业公司都找了过去的历史材料，做为编制计划的依据，然后组织干部学习，进行民主讨论，制订计划。在执行计划过程中，县委商业研究组经常不断地深入基层商店督促检查计划的执行情况，检查货源情况，发现问题及时解决。在第一季度发现有十几种布匹在五天内不进货就要脱销，而按进货计划还得十天才能进货；县委责成工商科立即研究这种情况，派出得力干部去批发站提前组织进货，保证了供应。
    四、注意各部门互相配合，密切国营商业和合作社的关系。过去国营商业与合作社的关系不够协调；商业会议以后，由于县委统一领导，注意了各有关部门间的配合，强调了从工作出发，从满足人民需要出发，表扬了好的典型，批评了坏的现象，使国营商业的干部明确认识了“要想完成计划，必须依靠合作社”的道理。从此，他们对待合作社的态度是尽量给予方便，为了不耽误基层社领货，在星期日或假日，店员们都轮流休息；批发部主任经常召开村社采买员座谈会，征求他们的意见，了解人民的需要。县联社经常主动地了解国营各专业公司的计划完成情况，发现国营商店的滞销商品，就主动地帮助代销和试销。二月份县委发现合作社购粮计划完成的不够好，生产资料大部分没有卖到农民手里，就责成各专业公司、粮食、县社等部门抽出五十多个干部，深入村屯帮助基层社宣传购粮政策，打消了农民的思想顾虑，完成了购销计划。银行与国营商业、合作社之间的关系也密切了，他们经常主动地去商店、合作社帮助研究资金使用，检查库存，在资金上尽力给予必需的支持。
    五、加强区委对合作社工作的领导。县委在每次区委书记会议上，都要布置检查区委对供销合作社的领导，批判不管供销合作社的作法。在各界人民代表会议以及全县的村干部大会上，也讨论供销合作社的工作。因此，全县绝大多数区村党、政干部对供销合作社工作是关心的，关系是密切的。例如：四、六区区委在布置区干部下乡工作时，都将合作社工作列为一项任务。区委书记经常去合作社了解情况，帮助解决问题，给合作社干部作报告，组织大家学习。
