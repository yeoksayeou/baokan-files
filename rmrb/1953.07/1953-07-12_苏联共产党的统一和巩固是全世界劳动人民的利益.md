The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet of the Soviet Union exposed the anti-Party and anti-state crimes of the revolutionary traitor Beria, and decided to expel him from the Party, remove him from his posts, and submit his case to the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union for trial. This is a great victory for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people in crushing the anti-Soviet conspiracies of imperialism and defending the unity and consolidation of the Communist Party. This is also a great victory for the working people of the world, because the unity and consolidation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is in the interests of the working people of the world.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the most valuable legacy that the great Lenin and Stalin left to the working people of the world. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the bastion of the international communist movement organized entirely according to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the leader of the Soviet state and the Soviet people, the leader of Soviet communist construction and Soviet peaceful diplomacy, the pioneer and model for communist parties in all countries, and the hope of all the working people, all the oppressed nations, and all peace-loving and progressive humanity in the world. There is no doubt that any weakening and destruction of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will only be an attack on the interests of the working people of the world and a service to the interests of imperialism.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is powerful not only because its propositions and actions conform to the present and future interests of the Soviet people and the working people of the world, but also because it is completely united in organization. On this point, we would do well to revisit Comrade Stalin's famous assertion in "The Foundations of Leninism":

	The Party is unity of will, which excludes all factionalism and groupism. Without a party which is strong by reason of its solidarity and iron discipline, it is impossible to achieve and maintain the dictatorship of the proletariat. But iron discipline in the Party is inconceivable without unity of will and without the complete and absolute solidarity of action of all members of the Party. This does not mean, of course, that the possibility of conflicts of opinion within the Party is thereby precluded. On the contrary, iron discipline does not preclude but presupposes criticism and conflicts of opinion within the Party. Least of all does it mean that discipline must be "blind." On the contrary, iron discipline does not preclude but presupposes conscious and voluntary submission, for only conscious discipline can be truly iron discipline. But after a conflict of opinion has been closed, after criticism has run its course and a decision has been arrived at, the unity of will and the unity of action of all Party members are the necessary condition without which neither Party unity nor iron discipline in the Party is conceivable.

Lenin said:

	"In the present era of acute civil war, the Communist Party must, in order to fulfill its task, be organized in the most centralized manner possible, and the iron discipline prevailing in its ranks must be almost military discipline; its Party center must be an authoritative body possessing extensive powers and enjoying the universal confidence of the members of the Party." (From the Conditions of Admission to the Communist International, see Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 25, pp. 282-283) Such is the question of Party discipline in the conditions of struggle preceding the achievement of the dictatorship.

	The same, if not more, must be said about Party discipline after the achievement of the dictatorship.

Lenin said:

	"Whoever weakens ever so little the iron discipline of the party of the proletariat (especially during its dictatorship) actually aids the bourgeoisie against the proletariat." (See Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 25, p. 190)

	But from this it follows that the existence of factionalism is incompatible either with Party unity or with its iron discipline. It scarcely needs proof that the existence of factions leads to the existence of several centers; and that the existence of several centers means the absence of a common center in the Party, the breaking up of unity of will, the weakening and disintegration of discipline, the weakening and disintegration of the dictatorship. Of course, the parties of the Second International, which are opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat and do not want to lead the proletarians to power, can afford such liberal amusements as freedom of factionalism, for they need no iron discipline whatever. But the parties of the Communist International, which base their activities on the task of achieving and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, cannot afford to be "liberal" or to permit freedom of factionalism. The Party represents unity of will, which precludes all factional activity and all dispersion of power in the Party.

	That is why Lenin, interpreting the "danger of factionalism" from the standpoint of "the need for the unity of the Party and for achieving unity of will of the proletarian vanguard as a fundamental condition for the success of the dictatorship of the proletariat," expressly stated in the special resolution on Party unity passed by the Tenth Congress of our Party.

	That is why Lenin, demanding the "complete elimination of all factionalism" and the "immediate dissolution of all groups, without exception, that have been formed on the basis of one platform or another" (see Resolution on Party Unity), threatened "unconditional and immediate expulsion from the Party."

	That is why Comrade Malenkov emphasized in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The unity of the Party ranks was, is and always will be the foundation of the strength and invincibility of our Party."

It can be seen from this that whoever supports the Communist Party of the Soviet Union must support the unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; conversely, whoever undermines the unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is helping the bourgeoisie and opposing the proletariat, helping imperialism and opposing the Soviet Union.

The traitor Beria was precisely helping imperialism and opposing the Soviet Union in this way. He took advantage of the conditions after the death of Comrade Stalin, took advantage of the rampant anti-Soviet activities of imperialism, and began to expose his own sinister features as a careerist. He undermined the Party's unity based on collective leadership, attempted to place the Ministry of Internal Affairs above the Party and the government, and attempted to use the Ministry of Internal Affairs, whose task was to oppose the enemy, to oppose the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government, in order to carry out adventurous activities to seize power. There is no doubt that this was a shameful betrayal of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet state, and the Soviet people, and a despicable internal response to the anti-Soviet conspiracy of imperialism. The traitor Beria has proven himself to be a mortal enemy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and an agent of imperialism.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people express infinite indignation at the criminal acts of the traitor Beria, and express great satisfaction and firm support for the Soviet Communist Party and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union's rapid and resolute cleansing of the traitor. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people firmly believe that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, headed by Comrade Malenkov, will achieve even greater victories in the great cause of leading the entire Soviet people in building communism and defending world peace after cleaning up the traitor Beria.

Imperialist anti-Soviet elements have revealed undisguised disappointment at Beria's purge. Imperialist anti-Soviet elements originally dreamed that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union might not pay attention to or sanction the activities of anti-Party elements, dreaming that such anti-Party elements could create a "split" in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After their dreams were shattered, they had to busy themselves spreading such ridiculous rumors, such as insisting that the purge of the traitor was a struggle between individuals, or insisting that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had already "split" or "weakened," and so on. But these rumors are ultimately untenable. People only need to recall that when Lenin and Stalin led the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to fight against the traitors Trotsky, Bukharin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and the like, imperialist anti-Soviet elements also insisted that this was a struggle between individuals, and also insisted that the purge of these traitors weakened the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union, but the opposite historical facts completely bankrupted their rumors. Similarly, when the Chinese Communist Party purged the traitors Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao, the enemies of the Chinese Communist Party also attempted to distort this as a struggle between individuals, and predicted that the Chinese Communist Party would be weakened, and that imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries would gain unexpected benefits. However, the opposite historical facts also completely bankrupted these rumors. Comparing these historical facts, it is not difficult for people to understand how many times more consolidated the position of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is today in opposing the traitor Beria than it was in the past in opposing the traitors Trotsky, Bukharin, and others, or than the Chinese Communist Party was in the past in opposing the traitors Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao. The traitor Beria has not been able to split the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and can only find his own destruction. It is precisely because of this that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was able to implement the purge of Beria so quickly and so unitedly. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has fully demonstrated its consolidation and unity, and after this purge, it will become even more consolidated and united. Let the stupid pigs of imperialism blindly say that the Great Wall of the Soviet Union and the peace and democracy camp has been weakened and can be broken, anyway, in the end, it will only be the pig's mouth that is broken, and not the Great Wall!

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union's sanction of the traitor Beria has given communist parties in various countries important political lessons. Comrade Stalin had long warned communists around the world: "The fortress is most easily breached from within. In order to achieve victory, it is first necessary to clear out all the capitulationists, deserters, scabs, and traitors in the workers' party, in the leadership headquarters of the workers' class, and in the workers' advanced fortress." (Conclusion to the History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union) But not every capitulationist, deserter, scab, and traitor is easy to identify. In the complex process of class struggle, unstable and disloyal elements, speculators, and careerists often join the ranks of the proletariat, and they often disguise themselves closely, and therefore may still temporarily deceive the trust of the Party and the people. These people have become the objects pursued by imperialists and other counter-revolutionary forces in their conspiracies to destroy the Communist Party. In order to discover the true face of these people in a timely manner and stop their harmful behavior in a timely manner, it is necessary to maintain constant revolutionary vigilance against class enemies at home and abroad, and to conduct systematic Party supervision over any Party member (no matter how high his position) and any working organ (no matter how great its "special nature"). It is necessary to strictly adhere to the collective nature and unity of Party leadership, resolutely oppose decentralism and the personality cult, adhere to the Party's unified cadre policy and unified discipline, and not allow any independent kingdoms to exist that are divorced from the Party's collective leadership and unified discipline. It is necessary to make every effort to strengthen the work of militant Marxist-Leninist propaganda and education within and outside the Party, to continuously improve the level of awareness of Party members and the working people, and to continuously strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses of the people. Profoundly comprehending the lessons of the Beria incident, strengthening Party unity, improving Party work, strengthening our country's economic construction work, consolidating the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and strengthening the struggle to win world peace and oppose imperialist conspiracy activities - this is the combat task of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people.

### 苏联共产党的统一和巩固是全世界劳动人民的利益

    苏联共产党的统一和巩固是全世界劳动人民的利益
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联最高苏维埃主席团揭发了革命叛徒贝利亚的反党反国家的罪行，并分别决定开除他的党籍，撤消他的职务，将他的罪案提交苏联最高法院审理。这是苏联共产党和苏联人民在粉碎帝国主义反苏阴谋、保卫共产党的统一和巩固的斗争中的一个巨大胜利。这也是全世界劳动人民的一个巨大胜利，因为苏联共产党的统一和巩固是全世界劳动人民的利益。
    苏联共产党是伟大的列宁和斯大林留给全世界劳动人民的最宝贵的遗产。苏联共产党是完全按照马克思列宁主义的原理组织起来的国际共产主义运动的堡垒。苏联共产党是苏联国家和苏联人民的领导者，是苏联共产主义建设和苏联和平外交的领导者，是世界各国共产党的先驱和模范，是全世界一切劳动人民、一切被压迫民族和一切爱好和平进步的人类的希望所寄。毫无疑问，任何对于苏联共产党的削弱和破坏，都只会是对于世界劳动人民利益的攻击，对于帝国主义利益的服务。
    苏联共产党之所以有力量，不仅因为它的主张和行动符合于苏联人民和全世界劳动人民的现在和将来的利益，而且因为它在组织上完全统一。关于这一点，我们最好是在这里重温一次斯大林同志在“论列宁主义基础”一书中的著名的论断：
    党是意志底统一，不容有派别组织存在。如果没有因本身具备团结性和铁的纪律而强有力的党，那就不能争得和保持无产阶级专政。可是，如果没有意志底统一，如果没有全体党员行动上的完全的和绝对的统一，那末党内铁一般的纪律是完全不可能的。这当然不是说，因此就绝对排斥党内有意见斗争的可能。恰巧相反，铁的纪律并不排斥，而是预定有党内批评和党内意见斗争。这更不是说，纪律应当是“盲目的”。恰巧相反，铁的纪律并不排斥，而是预定有自觉的和自愿的服从，因为只有自觉的纪律才能成为真正铁的纪律。可是，当意见斗争已经终结，批评已经完结，决议已经通过后，全体党员意志底统一和行动底统一，便是为保证党内统一和党内铁的纪律所绝对必要的条件。
    列宁说：
    “在现今国内战争尖锐的时代，共产党为要实现自己的职责，就一定要它是组织得最集中的，就一定要在它内部有几乎和军事纪律一样的铁的纪律统治着，就一定要全党中央是拥有广泛全权而为全体党员所共同信任的权威机关。”（摘自加入共产国际的条件，见列宁全集，第二十五卷，第二八二至二八三页）在争得专政以前的斗争条件下的党内纪律问题，就是这样。
    关于在争得专政以后的党内纪律，也要这样说，而且更要这样说。
    列宁说：
    “谁只要稍微减弱无产阶级党内铁的纪律
    （特别是在无产阶级专政时期），那他在事实上就是帮助资产阶级来反对无产阶级。”（见列宁全集，第二十五卷，第一百九十页）
    但由此就应得出结论：派别组织之存在，无论与党内统一或与党内铁的纪律，都是不能相容的。显然用不着证明：既有派别组织，就会产生几个中央；而既有几个中央，就是表明党内没有总的中央，就是分散统一的意志，就是减弱和破坏纪律，减弱和破坏专政。第二国际底党既然反对无产阶级专政和不愿意引导无产者去夺取政权，当然是能容许派别组织自由这一类自由主义玩艺的，因为他们根本就不需要铁的纪律。可是，共产国际底党既然把争得和巩固无产阶级专政的任务作为自己工作底基础，便不能容许“自由主义”，也不能容许派别组织自由。党是意志底统一，而不容许有任何派别组织活动和党内权力分散现象。
    因此，列宁就“从保持党内统一和实现无产阶级先锋队意志统一是保证无产阶级专政胜利的基本条件这一观点出发”，来解释“派别组织活动底危险性”，而我们党第十次代表大会就把这个解释明文载入论党内统一这个专门决议案内。
    因此，列宁就以“无条件地立刻开除党籍”相威胁，来要求“完全消灭任何派别组织活动”，并“立刻解散所有一切根据这个或那个政纲形成的集团”（见论党内统一决议案）。
    正因为这样，马林科夫同志才在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中强调指出：“党的队伍的统一，不论在过去、现在和将来，都永远是我们党的巩固和不可战胜的基础。”
    由此可见，谁要是拥护苏联共产党，他就必须拥护苏联共产党的统一；反之，谁要是破坏苏联共产党的统一，他就是帮助资产阶级而反对无产阶级，他就是帮助帝国主义而反对苏联。
    叛徒贝利亚正是这样来帮助帝国主义而反对苏联的。他利用了斯大林同志逝世后的条件，利用了帝国主义反苏活动猖狂的条件，开始暴露了自己的野心家的罪恶面目。他破坏党的以集体领导为基础的统一，企图把内务部放在党和政府之上，企图拿任务在于反对敌人的内务部机构来反对党的中央和苏联政府，来进行夺取权力的冒险活动。毫无疑问，这是对于苏联共产党、苏联国家和苏联人民的可耻的背叛，这是对于帝国主义反苏阴谋的卑鄙的内应。叛徒贝利亚已经证明自己成了苏联共产党和苏联人民的死敌，成了帝国主义的代理人。
    中国共产党和中国人民对于叛徒贝利亚的罪恶行为表示无限愤恨，而对于苏联共产党和苏联最高苏维埃主席团如此迅速地坚决地清洗了叛徒表示极大的欣慰和坚决的支持。中国共产党和中国人民坚决相信：以马林科夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央和苏联政府将在清洗叛徒贝利亚之后，在领导全苏联人民建设共产主义和保卫世界和平的伟大事业中得到更大的胜利。
    帝国主义反苏分子对于贝利亚的被清洗流露了不能掩饰的失望。帝国主义反苏分子本来梦想苏联共产党可以不注意或者不制裁反党分子的活动，梦想这种反党分子可以造成苏联共产党的“分裂”。他们在自己的梦想破灭以后，只好忙于散布这样那样的可笑的谣言，例如硬说对于叛徒的清洗是个人之间的斗争，或者硬说苏联共产党已经“分裂”或“削弱”等等。但是这些谣言究竟是不堪一驳的。人们只要回想，当列宁、斯大林领导苏联共产党向叛徒托洛茨基、布哈林、季诺维也夫、加米涅夫之流斗争的时候，帝国主义反苏分子也曾经硬说这是个人之间的斗争，也曾经硬说清洗了这些叛徒是削弱了苏联共产党和苏联，然而相反的历史事实却使他们的谣言完全破了产。同样，当中国共产党清洗了叛徒陈独秀和张国焘的时候，中国共产党的敌人也曾经企图曲解这是个人之间的斗争，并且预告中国共产党将被削弱，而帝国主义和国民党反动派则将获得意想不到的利益。然而相反的历史事实也使这些谣言完全破了产。比较一下这些历史的事实，那么人们就不难明白，苏联共产党中央在今天反对叛徒贝利亚的时候比在过去反对叛徒托洛茨基、布哈林等人的时候，或者比过去中国共产党反对叛徒陈独秀、张国焘的时候，地位是巩固多少倍了。叛徒贝利亚已经不能分裂苏联共产党，而只能找到个人的覆灭。正因为这样，苏联共产党中央才能如此迅速地和如此团结一致地实行对于贝利亚的清洗。苏联共产党已经充分表现了自己的巩固和统一，而经过这个清洗，它将变得更加巩固和统一。让帝国主义的蠢猪瞎说苏联和和平民主阵营的长城已经削弱了，可以碰烂了吧，反正最后碰烂了的只会是猪嘴，而不会是长城！
    苏联共产党对于叛徒贝利亚的制裁给了各国共产党重大的政治教训。斯大林同志早就告诫过全世界的共产主义者：“堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。为要达到胜利，首先就必须把工人阶级政党中间，工人阶级的领导司令部中间，工人阶级先头堡垒中间所有的投降主义者、逃兵、工贼和叛徒清除出去。”（联共（布）党史结束语）但是并不是每一个投降主义者、逃兵、工贼和叛徒都容易识别的。在阶级斗争的复杂过程中，经常有不坚定、不忠实的分子，投机家和野心家参加到无产阶级的队伍中来，他们往往把自己严密地伪装着，因而仍然可能暂时骗取党和人民的信任。这些人就成了帝国主义者和其他反革命势力在破坏共产党的阴谋中所追求的对象。为了及时地发觉这些人的真正面目，及时地制止他们的危害行为，必须对于国内外的阶级敌人经常保持革命警惕性，并且对于任何党员（不管他有多高的职位）和任何工作机关（不管它有多大的“特殊性”）经常进行有系统的党的监督。必须严格地坚持党的领导的集体性和统一性，坚决地反对分散主义和个人崇拜，坚持党的统一的干部政策和统一的纪律，而不允许有任何脱离党的集体领导和统一纪律的独立王国存在。必须用一切努力来加强党内外的战斗的马克思列宁主义的宣传教育工作，不断地提高党员和劳动人民的觉悟水平，不断地加强党和人民群众的联系。深刻地领会贝利亚事件的教训，加强党的统一，改善党的工作，加强我国的经济建设工作，巩固中苏两国的伟大友谊，加强争取世界和平和反对帝国主义阴谋活动的斗争——这就是中国共产党和中国人民的战斗任务。
