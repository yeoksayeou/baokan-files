    At the Morning Session of the Second National Congress of the Communist Youth League on July 2nd
    Comrade Deng Zihui Reports on Rural Work Issues
    The Second National Congress of the Communist Youth League of China continued on the morning of July 2nd.
    Comrade Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report to the Congress on "The Basic Tasks and Guiding Principles and Policies of Rural Work."
    In his report, Deng Zihui first described the great changes that have taken place in China's rural areas over the past four years. He then pointed out that the basic task of rural work in the future is to develop agricultural production, and in order to develop agricultural production on a large scale, it is necessary to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture and gradually realize the mechanization of agriculture.
    Deng Zihui said: At present, the most important goal of our agricultural production development is to increase grain production, and with the development of industry, to gradually increase the production of industrial raw material crops such as cotton, soybeans, sugarcane, and tobacco leaves in proportion. The first step in China's grain production should be to achieve an annual output of 550 billion to 600 billion jin of raw grain. That is to say, it is necessary to increase the total grain production of 1952 by more than 70 percent. In the first Five-Year Plan, grain production is required to increase by 30 percent on the basis of the actual output in 1952, and it is hoped that after two Five-Year Plans or a little more time, the above-mentioned first step requirement for grain production will be achieved.
    Deng Zihui said: In order to develop agricultural production, we must carry out socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy. Because the small-peasant economy cannot meet the ever-growing needs of the entire country for agricultural products. The industrialization of the country must be adapted to the development of agriculture, and in order for agriculture to have a great development, it must be gradually changed from the current small-peasant economy of animal-powered cultivation, manual irrigation, and natural fertilizers to the large-farm economy of machine cultivation, machine irrigation, and chemical fertilizers in the future. That is to say, it must be replaced by the collective ownership of farmers - that is, the collective farm system - instead of today's private ownership of farmers. The small-peasant economy either develops towards socialist large-scale agriculture or towards capitalist large-scale agriculture. If we allow rural capitalism to spread and develop, thereby causing the majority of farmers to fall into poverty and suffering, we will be divorced from the broad masses of farmers, which will hinder the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, affect the development of our country's industrialization, and may lead our country onto the path of capitalism. Therefore, the policy of socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy is absolutely unshakable. From now on, we must proceed from the current situation of the small-peasant economy, follow the path of "organizing ourselves" as instructed by Chairman Mao, and, according to the needs and awareness of the farmers, adapt to the enthusiasm of the farmers for mutual assistance and cooperation after the land reform, steadily develop the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, and gradually transition to fully socialist large-scale mechanized collective farms through the transitional forms of mutual assistance groups and agricultural production cooperatives. Of course, the development of mutual assistance groups and agricultural production cooperatives is not only to prepare for large-scale agricultural collectivization in the future, but also to meet the needs of developing agricultural production and increasing grain production at present. Only by running the mutual assistance groups and agricultural production cooperatives well, truly achieving more grain production, reducing costs, and truly increasing the income of group members and cooperative members, can farmers be convinced of the superiority of collective production and give farmers the most powerful collectivist education. Because of this, the tendency of rashness and adventurism in the mutual assistance and cooperation movement must be resolutely prevented and corrected.
    Deng Zihui pointed out: Correctly implementing the Party's various policies on leading rural production is of great significance for developing agricultural production. First, in the process of steadily developing mutual assistance and cooperation, it is necessary to fully understand the enthusiasm of farmers for the individual economy after the land reform, and recognize the characteristics of farmers as small private owners. We must adhere to the policy of firmly uniting with the middle peasants, the policy of allowing the existence of the rich peasant economy while restricting its development, and the policy of protecting the interests of small private owners of farmers. We must take care of individual farmers in the same way as we take care of mutual assistance and cooperation farmers, and we must respect the farmers' ownership of their land property. Second, we must vigorously develop rural supply and marketing cooperatives, allow free trade with leadership and necessary restrictions, promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and adopt correct price policies to gradually and appropriately narrow the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. Third, we must implement the fixed burden policy of "how much land is planted, how much grain should be produced, taxation is calculated according to the rate, tax reduction and exemption are carried out according to the law, and there is no increase in tax for increased production." Fourth, we must strive to overcome the "five excesses" phenomenon in rural areas, eliminate all subjective, doctrinaire, and commandist practices that are divorced from reality and hinder production, and all work that is needed by the masses and conforms to the interests of the masses must also be carried out in conjunction with production.
    When Deng Zihui talked about the improvement of agricultural production tools and farming techniques, he said: In the promotion of new agricultural tools, we must pay attention to meeting the needs of local production and the requirements of the masses; they must be affordable by the economic strength of the masses; the masses must understand their benefits; and the masses must be taught how to use them and how to repair them. There must be places to repair the tools when they are broken. In improving farming techniques, we must adopt the policy of "from the masses, to the masses," "taking materials locally, promoting locally," we must go deep into the peasant masses, learn from experienced old farmers, summarize and improve their successful experiences, and then promote them locally; if they are advanced experiences from foreign countries and other places, they must first be tested in state-owned farms and agricultural experiment stations, and use the successful high-yield results of their own experiments to educate farmers, and then attract farmers to learn consciously and voluntarily.
    Deng Zihui emphasized: The method of working in rural areas should be the method of "seeking truth from facts" that Chairman Mao often said, and oppose subjectivism, bureaucracy, and decentralization in rural work. He also called on young comrades to learn the Bolshevik style of combining revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, as pointed out by Stalin in his book "Foundations of Leninism."
    Finally, Deng Zihui talked about the importance of agricultural production and rural work. He encouraged young comrades and young farmers engaged in rural work to settle down and do a good job in agricultural production and various tasks in rural areas, and to strengthen their studies in work and production, learn agricultural production technology, learn culture, learn politics, learn Marxism-Leninism, train themselves, and improve themselves.
    After Deng Zihui's report, Hu Yaobang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Congress, made a summary report to the Congress. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在青年团第二次全国代表大会二日上午会议上
    邓子恢同志报告农村工作问题
    中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会二日上午继续举行。
    中共中央农村工作部部长邓子恢同志向大会作了“农村工作的基本任务和方针政策”的报告。
    邓子恢在他的报告中首先叙述了四年来我国农村中所发生的伟大变化。接着指出：今后农村工作的基本任务是发展农业生产，而为了大规模地发展农业生产，就必须逐步实现农业的社会主义改造，逐步实现农业的机械化。
    邓子恢说：目前我们发展农业生产的目标，最重要的是增产粮食，并随着工业的发展而逐渐按比例地增产工业原料作物如棉花、大豆、甘蔗、烟叶等。我国的粮食生产第一步应该要求达到年产原粮五千五百亿斤至六千亿斤。就是说，要在一九五二年的粮食总生产量的基础之上，再增加百分之七十以上。在第一个五年计划中，粮食增产要求在一九五二年实产量的基础上增加百分之三十，并希望经过两个五年计划或者更多一点时间，争取实现上述粮食生产的第一步要求。
    邓子恢说：为要发展农业生产，我们必须对小农经济实行社会主义改造。因为小农经济不能适应整个国家对于农产品的不断增长的需要。国家工业化，必须有农业发展与之相适应，而要农业有巨大的发展，又必须由现在的畜力耕种、人工灌溉、自然肥料的小农经济逐步地改变到将来用机器耕种、机器灌溉、化学肥料的大农场经济。就是说，必须由农民集体所有制——即集体农场制度来代替今天的农民私人所有制。小农经济不是向社会主义的大农业发展，就是向资本主义的大农业发展，如果我们放任农村资本主义泛滥发展，从而使大多数农民陷于贫穷困苦，我们就会脱离广大农民群众，就会妨碍工农联盟的巩固，就要影响我们国家工业化的发展，就可能使我们的国家走上资本主义的道路。所以，对小农经济实行社会主义改造的方针是绝对不可动摇的。我们要从现在起，从小农经济的现状出发，按照毛主席所指示的“组织起来”的道路，根据农民的需要和觉悟程度，适应农民在土地改革以后所发扬起来的互助合作的积极性，稳步发展互助合作运动，经过互助组和农业生产合作社这种过渡形式，逐步过渡到完全社会主义的大规模生产的机械化的集体农庄。当然，互助组和农业生产合作社的发展，不仅是为着将来大规模农业集体化作准备，同时还是为着适应当前发展农业生产和增产粮食的需要。只有把互助组和农业生产合作社办好，确实做到多打粮食，降低成本，确实增加组员和社员的收入，农民才能确信集体生产的优越性，才能给农民以最有力的集体主义教育。正因为如此，互助合作运动中的急躁冒进倾向，就必须坚决防止和纠正。
    邓子恢指出：正确贯彻党关于领导农村生产的各项政策，对于发展农业生产具有极重大的意义。第
    一，在稳步发展互助合作过程中，要充分了解农民在土地改革后对于个体经济的积极性，认清农民这种小私有者的特点。必须坚持巩固地联合中农的政策，允许富农经济存在而又限制富农发展的政策，实行保护农民小私有者利益的政策，必须同照顾互助合作农民一样照顾单干农民，必须尊重农民对于他们土地财产的所有权。第二，要大力发展农村供销合作社，允许有领导的和必要限制的贸易自由，促进城乡物资交流，并采取正确的价格政策，逐步地适当地缩小工业品和农产品之间的剪刀差。第三，要实行“种多少土地，应产多少粮食，依率计征，依法减免，增产不增税”的固定负担政策。第四，要努力克服农村中的“五多”现象，把一切脱离实际的主观主义、命令主义妨碍生产的作法去掉，一切为群众所需要的符合于群众利益的工作也必须结合着生产来进行。
    邓子恢谈到农业生产工具和耕作技术的改进问题时说：在新式农具的推广工作中，必须注意适合当地生产的需要和群众的要求；必须为群众的经济力量所能负担得起；必须让群众懂得它们的好处；还必须教会群众使用的方法和修理的方法，农具坏了要有地方修理。在改良耕作技术中，必须采取“从群众中来、到群众中去”“就地取材、就地推广”的方针，必须深入农民群众，向老农老圃学习，把他们成功的经验加以总结提高，而后再就地加以推广；如果是外国和外地的先进经验，则必须在国营农场和农事试验场中先行试验，以自己实验成功的丰产成绩来教育农民，再吸引农民自觉自愿地来学习。
    邓子恢着重指出：在农村中进行工作的方法，应该是毛主席所常说的“实事求是”的方法，反对农村工作中的主观主义、官僚主义和分散主义。他并号召青年同志们学习斯大林在“论列宁主义基础”一书中所指出的把革命热情和实事求是的精神结合起来的布尔什维克的作风。
    最后，邓子恢谈到农业生产和农村工作的重要性。他勉励从事农村工作的青年同志和青年农民们安心搞好农业生产和农村中的各项工作，并在工作中、生产中加强学习，学农业生产技术，学文化，学政治，学马克思列宁主义，锻炼自己，提高自己。
