Soviet Red Cross experience proves that factory first-aid stations are a good organizational form. It not only promotes sanitation work within the factory, but also assists medical institutions in first-aid work, allowing the injured and sick to receive timely treatment, thereby increasing worker attendance rates.

In order to utilize this advanced Soviet experience, the Beijing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China developed members in the Jingxi Mining Area last October, established Red Cross Society branches, and conducted first-aid training for workers in mid-February of this year. The first worker first-aid training class trained a total of 78 first-aiders.

Beginning in mid-March, sixteen workshop and underground first-aid stations were established in various factories and mines in the Jingxi Mining Area. As of the end of May, more than 1,990 person-times had received first aid within two and a half months. Taking the Chengzi Mine as an example, nearly 500 person-times received first aid in April, of which 21.5 percent were for trauma first aid, 68.5 percent were for headache and stomachache first aid, and 10 percent were for first aid for other diseases. Before the establishment of first-aid stations, all minor injuries and illnesses could only be treated above ground. Now the situation is different; workers can go directly to the first-aid station for treatment when they have minor illnesses or injuries. Due to the implementation of underground first-aid work, the number of treatments in the medical room has been greatly reduced, decreasing by 504 person-times in April compared to February (underground workers); while the worker attendance rate increased by 10 percent compared to February.

The work of first-aid training was carried out as follows. Staff members of the Beijing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China first explained to the factory and mine leaders that the purpose of carrying out first-aid work was to improve workers' health knowledge, ensure workers' physical health, and enable the smooth completion of production tasks. They also introduced the work of the Soviet Red Cross Society's first-aid stations in factories and mines and the role they played, so that the leadership would attach importance to first-aid training. However, some leading comrades believed that the more mass organizations there were in the factories and mines, the more trouble it would cause the leadership; the main task of the workers was production, and if there were too many mass activities, it would affect production. Moreover, they believed that with a medical room, what was the need for a first-aid station? Therefore, although they said verbally, "Okay, very good..." they still did not truly value first-aid work in their minds.

At that time, the staff members of the Beijing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China realized that without the support of the factory and mine leadership, the work could not be carried out, and training classes could not be forced to be established. They continued to use facts to explain the benefits of first-aid work to production to the factory and mine leadership. On the other hand, they actively publicized to members (worker comrades) that workers are the masters of factories and mines and must have healthy bodies to ensure the completion of production tasks; after joining the Red Cross Society, they must work hard to learn health knowledge, especially first-aid techniques; with the establishment of first-aid stations in workshops and underground, workers can receive first aid for injuries, pains, and emergency illnesses, which can alleviate pain and not affect production.

After such publicity, workers had a full understanding of first-aid work, and they expressed their desire to learn. The confidence of the Red Cross staff was greatly strengthened. Based on the workers' opinions, they requested the factory and mine leaders to open first-aid training classes, and finally obtained their consent.

When the first-aid stations were first established, many workers did not trust the first-aiders. Some workers believed that the first-aiders had only learned for a few days and could not solve any problems, so they held a contemptuous attitude towards the first-aiders. A worker in the Chengzi Mine said to a first-aider: "What can you do? I would rather die than let you give me first aid!"

However, the first-aiders realized that first aid is the glorious task of Red Cross members, and they can only establish prestige among the masses by serving patients with a high degree of responsibility. They recognized this and acted accordingly. For example, Zhao Zhongyou, a worker in the ninth group of the Chengzi Mine, had his hand injured by a piece of coal, and the bleeding would not stop. The first-aider carefully disinfected and applied medicine to him, and also gave him painkillers. After receiving treatment, Zhao Zhongyou said: "I never believed in you before, but today I truly understand the role of first-aiders. If it weren't for the first-aider giving me first aid, I would have been in excruciating pain!" Another example is Wang Yide and two other hook workers working at the ventilation opening underground, who suddenly suffered from stomach pain due to being exposed to the cold. They also did not trust the first-aider and wanted to walk to the ground for treatment. After first-aider Wang Zhiyuan discovered this, he immediately chased after them, called them back, and gave each of them a bottle of emergency medicine. Ten minutes later, all three were well and resumed work. In this way, first-aid work gradually established prestige among the masses.

The issue of first-aiders' wages initially caused a lot of controversy. Some workers were afraid of affecting the production of their group and did not agree to first-aiders going to other groups for first aid. For example, some workers in the Chengzi Mine said: "I know that the first-aider is not resting when he goes out for first-aid work. But our group's production tasks also have his share. If we can't complete the task, who will be responsible? Can he go to the Red Cross to collect his wages?" However, the first-aiders did not let the wage issue affect their first-aid work. Some first-aiders said: "First aid is my task, and it is also for the benefit of our workers. I have to do first-aid work even if I get less wages." One day, first-aider Liang Juyuan went down the mine to work in the morning and encountered a worker with a broken leg at the mine entrance. He immediately took over the work of another first-aider (because this first-aider had reached the end of his shift), quickly bandaged the injured worker, escorted him home, and then returned to the mine to work. Liang Juyuan's actions moved the workers, who said: "You are doing first-aid work for the welfare of our workers. In the future, we must work harder to ensure the completion of production tasks." Later, the administrative leaders paid attention to the issue of first-aiders' wages and convened a special meeting to discuss it. They believed that since the establishment of the first-aid station, many problems had been solved in treatment, all work-related injuries had been treated in a timely manner, and productivity had been improved. Therefore, first-aiders should not receive less wages, and other workers should not work extra. Therefore, the administrative leaders made the following regulations on this issue: If a first-aider delays production due to treating the injured and sick, four hours of wages will be compensated for within four hours, and eight hours of wages will be compensated for if it exceeds four hours. This regulation further encouraged the first-aiders' work enthusiasm.

The leadership issue of the first-aid station is also a very important issue. According to the experience of the Beijing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China, it is difficult for the Red Cross organization of the factory to completely control the first-aid station, and it must be under the unified leadership of the factory and mine administrative leaders. Especially when the first-aid station was first established, the first-aid station often encountered many difficulties in assigning first-aid personnel. For example, workers work in three shifts every day, and after the shifts are adjusted, some groups have many first-aiders, while some groups do not have even one, which affects first-aid work. In order to solve this problem, the Beijing Branch of the Red Cross Society of China, together with the trade union organizations, health administrative leadership agencies, and medical rooms of various units, decided to unify the control of the administrative leaders. Now, when the mines adjust worker shifts, they can take into account the distribution of first-aiders. The responsible departments convene first-aiders once a week to report on work, discuss problems that occur in work, and distribute medicines. The medical office sends people to guide the first-aiders' learning to improve their skills. The Red Cross organization also regularly sends people to various units to attend meetings and help first-aiders learn. In this way, the first-aiders are given greater encouragement, and the first-aid station is slowly consolidated.

    北京市京西矿区的急救站是怎样组织起来的
    张书绅
    苏联红十字会的工作经验证明，工厂急救站是一种良好的组织形式，它不仅可以推动厂内的卫生工作，而且可以协助医疗机构进行急救工作，使伤病员及时地得到救治，从而提高工人的出勤率。
    中国红十字会总会北京市分会为了运用苏联这一先进经验，去年十月在京西矿区发展了会员，成立了红十字会支会，并于今年二月中旬在工人中进行了急救训练。第一期工人急救员训练班，共训练了急救员七十八名。
    从三月中旬开始，京西矿区各厂矿成立了十六个车间和井下急救站。截至五月底，两个半月内急救了一千九百九十余人次。拿城子矿来说，四月份急救将近五百人次，其中外伤急救人次占百分之二十一点五，头痛病和肚痛病的急救人次占百分之六十八点五，其他疾病的急救人次占百分之十。在没有设立急救站以前，一切轻伤、小病都只能在井上治疗；现在的情况就不同了，工人有了小病、伤痛可直接到急救站去治疗。由于开展了井下急救工作，医疗室的治疗人次大大减少了，四月份比二月份减少了五百零四人次（井下工人）；而工人出勤率则比二月份提高了百分之十。
    急救训练的工作是这样进行的。中国红十字会总会北京市分会的工作人员首先向厂矿领导方面说明，开展急救工作的目的在于提高工人的卫生知识水平，保证工人的身体健康，使生产任务能顺利完成。并介绍了苏联红十字会急救站在工矿内的工作情况及其所起的作用，使领导方面重视急救训练工作。但有些领导同志认为，工矿内群众团体越多，越给领导方面增加麻烦；工人的主要任务是生产，如果群众活动多了，就会影响生产。而且他们又认为，有了医疗室，还要什么急救站。因此，他们虽然口头上说：“可以，很好……”但思想上仍没有真正重视急救工作。
    当时，中国红十字会总会北京市分会的工作人员认识到在没有得到厂矿领导方面的支持以前，工作是无法开展的，决不能勉强开办训练班。便一方面继续用事实来向厂矿领导方面说明急救工作对生产的好处，另一方面积极向会员（工人同志）宣传：工人是工矿的主人，必须有健康的身体，才能保证生产任务的完成；参加红十字会后要努力学习卫生常识，特别是急救技术；在车间和井下成立了急救站，工人们有了伤痛及紧急疾患，就可以急救，这样既可以减轻疾痛，又不影响生产等。
    经过这样的宣传，工人对急救工作有了充分的认识，他们表示希望学习。红十字会工作人员的信心就大大地加强了。根据工人的意见，他们向厂矿领导方面提出了开办急救训练班的要求，终于取得了同意。
    急救站开始成立时，有不少工人对急救员是不信任的。有的工人认为，急救员刚学了几天，不能解决什么问题，因而对急救员抱着轻视的态度。城子矿有一个工人对急救员说：“你们能干什么，我死了也不让你们急救！”
    但是急救员认识到急救是红十字会员的光荣任务，只有以高度负责的精神给病人服务，才能在群众中建立威信。他们这样认识，也这样行动。例如，城子矿第九组工人赵忠有的手被煤块砸伤，流血不止。急救员便很细心地给他消毒、上药，又给他服了止痛片。赵忠有受到救护后，便说：“从前我根本不相信你们，今天我真正知道了急救员的作用。要不是急救员给我急救，可要把我疼死啦！”又如井下把钩工人王一德等三人，在井下通风口处工作，因受凉，突然发生肚痛。他们也不信任急救员，要步行到井上治疗。急救员王之元发觉后，马上追过去，把他们叫回来，每人给服了一瓶救急药水。十分钟以后，三个人都好了，恢复了工作。这样，急救工作就逐渐在群众中树立起威信。
    急救员的工资问题，开始时曾引起了很多的争论。有的工人怕影响本组的生产，不同意急救员到其他组去进行急救。如城子矿有的工人说：“急救员出去作急救工作，我也知道并不是休息。但是咱们组的生产任务也有他的份儿，若是完不成任务，谁来负责呢？他能到红十字会去领工资吗？”但急救员们并不因为工资问题而影响自己的急救工作。有的急救员说：“急救是我的任务，也是为了咱们工人的利益。我就是少拿工资也得去做急救工作。”有一天，急救员梁聚元早晨下井工作，在井口遇到一个被砸伤小腿的工人，他就马上接替另一个急救员的工作（因为这个急救员已到了下班的时间），迅速地给受伤的工人包扎起来，把他护送到家以后才回到井里工作。梁聚元的行动感动了工人们，他们说：你去做急救工作，也是为了咱们工人的福利，以后我们大家要加油干，保证完成生产任务。后来，急救员的工资问题引起了行政领导方面的注意，专门召开会议进行了讨论，认为急救站成立以来，在治疗上解决了不少问题，所有工伤都得到及时处理，提高了生产率；因此，不能让急救员少得工资，也不能让其他工人加工。于是行政领导方面对这个问题作了如下的规定：急救员如因救治伤病员而耽误了生产，四小时以内的均补给四小时的工资，如超过四小时则补给八小时的工资。这个规定，更鼓舞了急救员的工作情绪。
    急救站的领导问题，也是一个很重要的问题。根据中国红十字会总会北京市分会的经验，急救站完全由工厂红十字会组织掌握是困难的，必须由厂矿行政领导方面统一领导。特别是在急救站刚成立的时候，急救站在分配急救人员方面往往遇到很多的困难。例如，工人每日分三班工作，班次调动后，有的组有很多的急救员，而有的组连一个也没有，这样就影响了急救工作。为了解决这个问题，中国红十字会总会北京市分会和各单位的工会组织、卫生行政领导机构和医疗室协商，决定统一由行政领导方面掌握。现在，各矿在调动工人班次时，都能照顾到急救员的分布，每周由负责的部门召集急救员开一次会，汇报工作，讨论工作中所发生的问题，并发给药品。医务所则派人指导急救员的学习，以提高他们的技术。红十字会组织也经常派人到各单位参加会议，帮助急救员进行学习。这样，急救员就得到了更大的鼓励，急救站也就慢慢地巩固起来了。
