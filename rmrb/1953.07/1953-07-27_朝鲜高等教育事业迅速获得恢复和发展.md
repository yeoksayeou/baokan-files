Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th. Korean higher education is rapidly recovering and developing. Today, all fifteen universities in Korea have been restored, and many students are studying hard under state support, preparing to participate in the country's reconstruction.

    In the era of Japanese imperialism, there was not a single university in the northern half of Korea. After liberation, the Korean people established the famous Kim Il-sung University, as well as two industrial universities, three medical universities, four teacher training colleges, and one each of normal university, agricultural university, Russian language school, music school, and art school. More than 15,900 university students studied in these fifteen schools. After the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, these schools suffered brutal destruction by the enemy. School buildings, books, materials, and experimental equipment were almost completely lost. Students and teachers from all universities responded to the call of the motherland and went to the front lines to fight for the independence and culture of the country.

    In late 1950 and early 1951, after the Korean and Chinese People's Armies repelled the frantic attacks of the US invading forces, the Korean people's leader Kim Il-sung called on educators to restore cultural and educational institutions. With the assistance of the broad masses of people, the staff of the various universities carried out arduous restoration work on the ruins and rubble. In February 1951, Sinuiju Teacher Training College was the first to announce its reopening, and by the end of the year, all fifteen universities in northern Korea had reopened.

    Young students working in various government organs and fighting on the front lines successively came to the universities. Among the students, 96 percent were from working-class and peasant families, and many were heroic soldiers. For example, at Kim Il-sung University, 55 percent of the students came from the military, and more than 30 percent of them had won various medals or awards.

    To ensure the progress of their studies, students and teachers, in addition to attending classes, also dug underground classrooms together and built and repaired dormitories.

    After the restoration work in 1951, in 1952, the Korean Workers' Party and the government vigorously supplemented university professors, compiled teaching materials, and improved teaching quality. As a result, both the quantity and quality of university faculty members were greatly improved. The plan to compile more than 1,000 kinds of teaching outlines in 1952 was also overfulfilled by the end of the year.

    The academic performance of students at the universities is very good. At Kim Il-sung University, for example, 89 percent of the graduates are top or excellent students. University research work is also becoming increasingly active. The content of the research is closely coordinated with the practical problems in ensuring victory in the war and in production work. For example, the Kim Chaek University of Technology organized a "Wartime Scientific Research Group" to conduct research in various production departments, and they have made many inventions and creations. By the end of 1952, more than 200 faculty and staff members at the universities had submitted research topics to the state for research, and government departments had entrusted universities with hundreds of research projects. The students' excellent academic performance and the schools' active research clearly demonstrate the vigorous development of Korean higher education.

    朝鲜高等教育事业迅速获得恢复和发展
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】朝鲜高等教育事业正在迅速恢复和发展中。今天，朝鲜十五个大学已经全部恢复，很多学生正在国家供给下努力学习，准备参加祖国的恢复建设。
    朝鲜北半部在日本帝国主义统治时代原是一所大学也没有的。解放后，朝鲜人民建立了著名的金日成综合大学，以及工业大学二所，医科大学三所，教员大学四所，师范大学、农业大学、俄文学校、音乐学校、美术学校各一所。在这十五所学校中学习的大学生，共有一万五千九百多人。美国发动侵朝战争后，这些学校受到了敌人残暴的破坏。校舍、图书、资料、实验设备损失殆尽。各大学的学生和教师响应祖国的号召，全都走上了前线，为保卫祖国的独立和文化而斗争。
    一九五零年底和一九五一年初，朝中人民军队击退了美国侵略军的疯狂进攻后，朝鲜人民领袖金日成号召教育工作者恢复文化教育机关。各大学的工作人员在广大人民的协助下，在废墟瓦砾之上进行了艰巨的恢复工作。一九五一年二月，新义州教员大学首先宣告开学，到年底，朝鲜北部的十五个大学就全部开学了。
    在各机关工作和在前线战斗的青年学生们陆续来到大学。学生中，百分之九十六是工、农劳动人民家庭出身的，很多人是英勇的战士，如在金日成大学的学生中，有百分之五十五是从军队来的，他们百分之三十以上曾获得各种勋章或奖章。
    为了保证学业的进行，学生们和教员们除上课外，还一起挖掘地下教室，并建造和修理宿舍。
    经过一九五一年的恢复工作，在一九五二年，朝鲜劳动党和政府大力进行了补充大学教授、编制教学材料和提高教学质量的工作。结果，各大学的教员数量和质量都大大提高了。预定在一九五二年内编制一千多种教授提纲的计划，到年底也超额完成。
    各大学学生的学业成绩都很好。以金日成大学为例，该校毕业生中，百分之八十九是最优等生和优等生。大学的研究工作也日益踊跃起来。研究的内容和保证战争胜利及生产工作中的实际问题是紧密地配合的。如金策工业大学曾组织“战时科学研究组”，到各生产部门进行研究，他们曾有不少的创造发明。到一九五二年底，各大学有教职员二百多人向国家提出研究题目后进行研究，政府部门委托大学进行研究工作的，也有数百件。学生优良的学习成绩和学校研究工作的踊跃，清楚地显示出朝鲜高等教育事业的蓬勃发展。
