    Memories of Kaesong
    Standing next to the armistice signing hall in Panmunjom and looking north, the majestic Songak Mountain, which dominates the 38th parallel, comes into view. It was from there that the sound of artillery fire erupted when the United States, at the behest of Syngman Rhee, launched a full-scale surprise attack across the 38th parallel on June 25th three years ago. The military roads, bunkers, trenches, and artillery positions built by Syngman Rhee for the invasion of North Korea still remain on the mountain. Three years and one month later, today, the representatives of both sides are sitting in the armistice signing hall in Panmunjom signing the agreement. The people of Kaesong, and indeed the entire Korean peninsula, China, and the world, are rejoicing and welcoming the ceasefire. But they are still asking: Can the Korean armistice lead to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue?
    In the 1950s, Kaesong, this ancient city battered by the winds of change, from Songak Mountain to Panmunjom, from the start of the war to the armistice, has twice issued news that has shaken the world. The residents of Kaesong are the authoritative witnesses to the ebb and flow of the forces in this battle between peace and war. Amidst the cheers celebrating the ceasefire, I stood on the Nandaemun tower in the center of Kaesong, gazing at the countless magnificent flags of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fluttering in the clear sky, and recalled the many past events that the people of Kaesong had told me. In April 1950, Lee Army Major General Kim Seok-won, stationed in Kaesong, reviewed the troops on this tower. At that time, he arrogantly declared to the people: as soon as the order was given, they would "eat lunch in Pyongyang and sleep by the Yalu River." This boastful general forgot the fact that their attacks north of the 38th parallel in late May and late July 1949, lasting two and three days respectively, had both failed. During the battle in May, they had even retreated from Songak Mountain to Nandaemun. At that time, the people of Kaesong, who had long awaited liberation, had already prepared the flags of the Republic and were ready to welcome the People's Army into the city. However, the People's Army stopped at the 38th parallel and did not advance. This disappointed the people of Kaesong somewhat, but they immediately understood: "The People's Army advocates the peaceful reunification of the motherland, so they avoid armed conflicts wherever possible." Who knew that Syngman Rhee would see this as a sign of weakness. During that parade, Kim Seok-won even made such a strange argument: "Kim Il-sung has no military power, so he calls for peace." At that time, countless patriots in Kaesong who were working for the peaceful reunification of the motherland were killed by the enemy or thrown into prison. But people still yearned for the area north of the 38th parallel. When people talked about the current situation, they would say such popular phrases: "What to do?" "Look north!" An old man named Kim Seong-hwan in Janam-dong said that in 1949 his fourth son, Kim Jae-chang, had crossed the 38th parallel to Pyongyang to participate in the "Representative Conference of the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front" jointly convened by seventy-one parties and social organizations from North and South Korea in response to the call for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. In June 1950, shortly before the outbreak of the war, the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front specially sent Kim Jae-chang, Kim Tae-hong, Lee In-gyu, and three others as representatives to South Korea to convey to the people and various parties and social organizations the plan for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the suggestion to convene a meeting between North and South Korea in September to discuss the organization of a unified government. However, when Kim Jae-chang and others arrived at a station called Yeohyeon, more than twenty li away from Kaesong on the 38th parallel, special agents sent by Syngman Rhee opened fire on them, arrested them, and secretly murdered them. At that time, Syngman Rhee completely ignored the demands of the people and actively planned for war. According to Choi Bok-eun, a farmer who guarded the deer park and peach orchard at the foot of Songak Mountain: "I saw the enemy preparing to open fire from May 1948." He pointed to the military road next to his house leading to the top of Songak Mountain and said: "This road alone took more than a year to build. At that time, about 5,000 civilians were driven to build roads and fortifications every day. By March to May 1950, all the fortifications were almost completed, and the army movement and military transportation on the mountain became very frequent, and the Lee army increased by at least four times. Many trucks transported ammunition, sandbags, and wood to the mountain every day. The activities of the U.S. military also gradually increased. The U.S. military installed a radio station about twenty meters west of my house. The U.S. military also set up a large guard post more than one hundred meters east of my house. Almost every day, three to five jeeps carrying Americans drove up the mountain. It was like this until a few days before 'June 25th'. At that time, I already saw something was wrong and expected something bad was about to happen. Sure enough, on June 25th, when the sky was still hazy, gunshots suddenly rang out on Songak Mountain, and the cannons erected near Nandaemun fired directly north. This time, the sound of cannons and gunshots was louder than any previous time." Three years ago, those warmongers, in order to realize their dreams, disregarded the wishes of the people and pushed them onto the path of war and disaster.
    The suffering that war brings to people is profound. In the first year of the war, when it was most intense and fierce, Kaesong was looted twice by the U.S. and Lee armies. During those turbulent days, tens of thousands of families were torn apart, and many people could not see their husbands, sons, and brothers. The number of people who died in the war cannot be calculated now. In September 1950 alone, when the enemy reoccupied Kaesong, more than 2,000 people were killed and abducted to the south by the "Greater Korean Youth Corps". On January 17, 1951, more than 3,000 people were killed and injured due to U.S. air raids. These losses cannot be compensated. But people did not succumb to this suffering. Everyone in Kaesong has grown in hatred for Syngman Rhee's launch of the war from their own life experiences. Shortly after Kaesong's first liberation, more than 2,000 young men and women in the city joined the ranks of defending the motherland. When the People's Army went south, for more than seventy consecutive days, five to six hundred people in the city voluntarily transported ammunition and supplies to the People's Army every day. A mother named Lee Hong-won in Manwol-ri had her husband murdered before the war for opposing Syngman Rhee's launch of the war. As soon as Kaesong was liberated, she dedicated her two sons to the Korean People's Army to fight on the front lines. She herself lived a very hard life with her three young children. She also actively led the women in the whole village to do various war support work. People not only saw their own immediate difficulties and pain, but also saw the victory of the entire battlefield. People firmly believed that the final victory must belong to the just war supported by the people. Their view was correct. After more than a year of fierce fighting, after the Korean and Chinese People's forces annihilated more than 200,000 enemies, the 155-mile front stabilized again north and south of the 38th parallel. Therefore, on July 8, 1951, the people of Kaesong saw the Americans return by car, but this time they were "returning" to a meeting. Peace was brewing again in Kaesong. People all over the world were watching Kaesong, expecting her to give birth to peace soon. However, babies who were born crying at the beginning of the negotiations could already play on the streets, wave to the representatives of the Korean and Chinese negotiations, and shout "Peace, peace!" But the armistice was still so difficult to produce. The people of Kaesong, who had witnessed the on-again, off-again negotiations for two years, had gained rich political experience. Many innocent and naive elementary school students, when they saw the cars of the Korean and Chinese negotiation delegation driving towards Panmunjom, would happily tell their parents or teachers. If they didn't see the cars for a long time, they would ask their mothers: "Has the meeting stopped again! Is the U.S. up to some new tricks again?" Many old ladies along the road from Kaesong to Panmunjom told me that although they saw the cars driving back and forth, they still wanted to take a look every time they saw the cars coming. Over the past two years, they had figured out a rule: as long as this road was deserted, they would immediately guess that the Americans were disrupting the negotiations again and launching an attack somewhere; and when there were frequent cars on this road, they would know that the Americans were definitely dissatisfied somewhere.
    July 10, 1951, was the first day of the negotiations, and it was also the first day of Van Fleet's summer offensive. It is conceivable that the negotiations would not be smooth. In late October, when the U.S. representative once again made land demands, they wanted our side to cede Kaesong. They also shamelessly said at the conference table: "If it weren't for the negotiations, we would have taken Kaesong long ago." They shouted: "Let the shells, bombs, and bullets continue to argue!" Which Kaesong person would not be filled with righteous indignation when they heard this? Once, a staff member of the Korean and Chinese negotiation delegation went to Deogam-ri Sechon-dong to do business, and was seen by the local residents. People immediately spread the word: "The person who is negotiating face-to-face with the Americans has arrived!" Before long, many people came to find this staff member, all vying to tell him their wishes and asking him to "never cede Kaesong to the other side." Some said: "If the other side comes to seize Kaesong, we civilians can organize to defend it!" An old lady with white hair also brought a twelve-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl to find him and said to him: "Even my old woman and children cannot let the American army come to Kaesong again!" When people heard that our representative insisted on not ceding Kaesong and the firm determination of the Korean and Chinese People's forces to defend Kaesong, people smiled and felt relieved. At that time, the enemy had already advanced north from the Sasicheon River Nammun-dong to the Yul-ri line, attempting to occupy our Sangzang Mountain and Cheondeok Mountain positions, and then threaten Kaesong. American planes buzzed over Kaesong all day long, and the sound of cannons often shook people's houses and conference tents. Farmers north of Jinbong Mountain, close to the front line, were often awakened in the night by the short bursts of grenades, rifles, and machine guns. However, people were very calm because the front line was gradually moving south. The farmers at the foot of Jinbong Mountain said it well: "Not long after the war started, we couldn't hear the sound of grenades anymore, then we couldn't hear the sound of rifles either, then we gradually couldn't hear the sound of machine guns either, and finally even the sound of cannons became distant. We can know that our troops are advancing victoriously and the days of peace are getting closer and closer just by listening to these changes in sounds!" In just one month after the U.S. side demanded that we withdraw from the Kaesong area and launched the "argument battle", the heroic Korean and Chinese People's forces drove all the enemies to the east of the Sasicheon River and south of the Han River, greatly advancing the position to the south, forming a new front line fifty kilometers long from the Yesong River in the west to Panmunjom, along the north bank of the Han River and the west bank of the Sasicheon River. If we look at it together with our army's positions east of Panmunjom, the previously parallel positions of the enemy and us have now become "V"-shaped. That is to say, our army's positions are on both sides of the enemy's corridor from Munsan to Panmunjom and its surrounding areas. Jinbong Mountain, formerly known as the "Kaesong Guard", is now a solid rear area more than twenty kilometers away from the front line. Since then, the main battles on the Kaesong front have been fought on the east side of the Panmunjom conference area, on the right bank of the Imjin River, and along the Sasicheon River. There, the main force of the other side, the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Division and the Lee Army 1st Division, often launched attacks with regiments and battalions. On Mount 88.6 northeast of Panmunjom, the enemy attacked a certain company of the Volunteer Army more than twenty times with dozens of companies and even several battalions. In a section of less than 500 meters, it fired more than 70 tons of steel shells. The grass and trees were burned to ashes, and the rocks were blown up several feet deep, but the position still stood firm! A certain unit of the Volunteer Army eliminated more than 10,000 enemies, destroyed and damaged 97 enemy tanks, and shot down and damaged 98 enemy aircraft in just a few battles to defend Kaesong. Only after several months of "debate" on the entire front line and the Kaesong front were the enemies, who had repeatedly created incidents of violating the agreement, forced to sit down and resume negotiations, and only then did the U.S. side understand that the tireless efforts of the Korean and Chinese negotiation representatives for the armistice and for insisting on negotiated solutions were not a sign of weakness, but for the wishes and interests of the people.
    In June of this year, when all signs indicated that the armistice was in sight, I visited many workers, farmers, students, housewives, and entrepreneurs in Kaesong. At that time, everyone's face showed the joy of victory. But what impressed me most was that without exception, they all talked about raising vigilance against the possibility of the U.S. side violating the agreement. Sure enough, soon after, the Syngman Rhee regime violated the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war and forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our prisoners of war. Why were the people of Kaesong able to see through the U.S. side so clearly? That was because the historical facts of the U.S. side in Kaesong told them, and the countless actions of the enemy in violating the agreement during the two years of negotiations told them. Over the past two years, the U.S. side has violated the agreement and invaded the Kaesong neutral zone more than 700 times, and invaded the Laephoong-dong and Panmunjom conference areas more than 140 times. These include serious incidents such as bombing and strafing the residences of the Korean and Chinese negotiation delegation and shelling the conference area. Peace warrior Yao Qingxiang and other comrades were killed by the enemy while guarding the conference area, and Kang Young-don, a child in Panmunjom, was also killed by the enemy while fishing by the river. Due to the other side's violation of the agreement, more than 30 people have been killed and injured. Now, the traces of the U.S. side's destruction of the conference area can still be seen everywhere in Kaesong. Kang Young-sik, a four-year-old child in Panmunjom, could only cry when he was shot in the elbow by an enemy plane two years ago. Now, when he sees people, he stretches out his hand to show them the scars. He already knows how to hate. The people of Kaesong know from their own personal experience that they must be vigilant against the enemy. However, the people of Kaesong saw an even more important historical fact: the result of the U.S. and Lee armies fighting for three years was only to lose a million lives in vain (of which more than 380,000 were American), and they could only stop in place. Last autumn, the U.S. and Lee armies attacked two small hills of Shangganling for more than a month, killing and wounding 25,000 people, and they could not advance an inch. However, the Korean and Chinese People's forces advanced 192.2 square kilometers in just six days from July 13th to 18th this year, eliminating more than 26,000 enemies. Now, when the armistice negotiations have been signed, Syngman Rhee is still continuing to clamor for disrupting the armistice. The "political conference" has not yet been convened, but they "predict" that the problem cannot be solved and prepare to continue fighting in three months. But are these "heroes" really so forgetful? The lessons of the past are not far away. Not to mention north of the 38th parallel, in Kaesong, isn't the lesson of war clear enough?

    开城的记忆
    徐熊
    站在板门店停战签字厅旁向北眺望，雄踞三八线上的松岳山巍峨在目。三年前的六月二十五日，美国指使李承晚向三八线以北发动全线的突然进攻时，炮声就是从那里响起的。现在山上还残留着李承晚当年为进攻北朝鲜而修建的军用公路、碉堡、战壕和炮兵阵地。时间隔了三年另一个月，今天，双方的代表坐在板门店停战签字厅里签字了。开城人民以至全朝鲜、全中国、全世界的人民都在欢欣鼓舞，欢迎停战。可是他们仍然在问：朝鲜停战能不能导致朝鲜问题的和平解决呢？
    在二十世纪五十年代里，开城，这个饱受风霜的古城，从松岳山到板门店，从开战到停战，已经两次发出了震动世界的新闻。开城的居民正是这场和平与战争搏战中两者力量消长的权威见证人。在人们欢庆停战声中，我站在开城市中心的南大门楼台上，凝视那些在晴空飘扬着的无数面朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的壮丽的国旗，想起开城人民告诉我的许多往事。一九五零年四月里，驻扎在开城的李军金锡源少将曾在这个楼台上阅过兵。当时他狂妄地向人们宣称：一待令下，他们就要“到平壤去吃午饭，到鸭绿江边睡大觉”。这位大言不惭的将军忘了他们在一九四九年五月下旬和七月下旬先后向三八线以北发动为时两昼夜和三昼夜的进攻都遭到失败的事实。在上述五月间的一次战斗里，他们还曾从松岳山上败退到南大门。当时久盼解放的开城人民已制好共和国国旗，准备迎接人民军进城。可是人民军停止在三八线上没有前进。这使开城人民有些失望，但他们立刻了解到：“人民军是主张和平统一祖国的，所以他们处处避免发生武装冲突。”谁知李承晚却把这些看成示弱。就在那次阅兵中，金锡源还发出过这样的怪论：“金日成没有军事力量，所以号召和平。”那时开城有无数为祖国和平、统一事业而奔走的爱国者被敌人杀害，或者被投入监狱。可是人们还是向往着三八线北。人们谈起时局就会讲起这样的流行语：“怎么办？”“向北看！”子男洞有位老人金星焕说：一九四九年他的第四个儿子金在昌就曾为了响应和平统一祖国的号召，越过三八线到平壤去参加由南北朝鲜七十一个党派和社会团体共同召开的“朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线代表大会”。一九五零年六月里，就在战争爆发前不久，朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会还特地派了金在昌、金泰弘、李寅奎等三人为代表，赴南朝鲜向人民及各党派、各社会团体传达和平统一祖国计划和九月间南北朝鲜开会协商组织统一政府的建议。可是当金在昌等人到达离开城二十多里在三八线上的一个叫砺岘的车站时，李承晚派遣的特务却向他们开枪，把他们逮捕起来，并暗害了他们。那时李承晚根本无视人民的要求而积极策划战争。据松岳山麓的一位看守鹿圃和桃园的农民崔福银说：“从一九四八年五月起，我就看到敌人在准备开火。”他指着他家旁通向松岳山顶的军用公路说：“光这条路就修了一年多，那时每天都有五千左右老百姓被赶来修公路、筑工事。等到一九五零年三月到五月间，一切工事都修筑得差不多了，山上的军队调动和军事运输就十分频繁起来，李军增加了至少四倍以上。每天都有很多卡车向山上运弹药、沙袋和木材。美军的活动也渐渐增加，在我家西边大约二十公尺的地方，美军安了一个电台。在我家东边一百多公尺的地方，美军还设了一个大岗哨站。差不多每天都有三、五辆载着美国人的吉普车开上山去。一直到‘六、二五’前几天还是这样。当时我已看出不对头，料到快要发生什么祸殃。果然，在六月二十五日那天，天还朦朦胧胧的呢，松岳山上忽然哗啦哗啦响起枪声，架设在南大门附近的那些大炮也一股劲直朝北打。这一次炮声和枪声比以往哪一次都响得厉害。”三年前，那些好战分子为了实现自己的迷梦，便不顾人民的愿望而把人民推上了战争灾难的道路。
    战争给人们的苦难是深重的。只在战争最紧张最激烈的第一年中，开城便经过美李军两次洗劫。在这动荡的日月里，成千成万的家庭被拆散了，很多人的丈夫、儿子和兄弟们不能见面了。在战争中死亡的人数现在还没法算出。仅在一九五零年九月里敌人重占开城时，被“大韩青年团”杀害和掳捕南去的就有两千多人。在一九五一年一月十七日这一天，因遭受美机轰炸而死伤的就有三千多人。这些损失是没法补偿的。但是人们并没有为这种苦难所屈服。开城每一个人都从自己的生活经历里增长了对李承晚发动战争的憎恨。在开城首次解放后不久，全市便有两千多青年男女投入了保卫祖国的队伍。人民军南下的时候，一连七十多天，全市每天都有五、六百人自动为人民军运输弹药和给养。满月里有位母亲叫李洪员的，丈夫在战前因反对李承晚发动战争而被谋害了。开城一解放，她便把两个儿子都献给朝鲜人民军去前方作战。她自己带着三个幼子过着非常艰苦的生活。她还积极地领导着全里妇女做各种战勤工作。人们不仅看到自己的眼前的艰难痛苦，而且看到整个战场的胜利。人们坚信最后胜利一定属于人民所拥护的正义的战争。他们这种看法是正确的。经过一年多激烈的战斗，在朝中人民部队歼灭二十多万敌人以后，一百五十五英里的战线便又在三八线南北稳定了下来。于是，在一九五一年七月八日，开城人民看到美国人又乘着车子回来了，但这次是“回来”开会。和平又在开城孕育了。全世界人民都瞩望着开城，期待她早日诞生和平。可是，在谈判开始时一些呱呱坠地的婴儿，已经能在街上玩耍，能向朝中谈判代表招手，能够喊叫“和平，和平！”了，而停战却还是那么难产。两年来亲眼看到谈判时辍时续的开城人民已经得到了丰富的政治经验。很多纯真幼稚的小学生们一见到朝中谈判代表团的小轿车向板门店开去时，就欢天喜地地去告诉他们父母或者老师。如果日子久不见小轿车了，他们便会问妈妈：“会又停啦！是不是美国人又在耍什么新花样？”从开城到板门店的公路旁很多老太太告诉我：她们虽然看到车子开过去又开过去，但是每次看到车子来了，她们还是想看一看。两年来，她们已摸出了一个规律：只要这条路上一冷落，她们马上就会猜到一定是美国人又在破坏谈判，又在什么地方发动进攻；而这条路上车子频繁的时候，她们又会知道准是美国人在什么地方不如意了。
    一九五一年七月十日是谈判开始的第一天，同时也就是范佛里特发动夏季攻势的第一天。谈判可想而知是不会顺利的。十月下旬，美方的代表在又一次提出土地要求来的时候，曾经想要我方让出开城。他们还在会议桌上恬不知耻地说：“要不是谈判我们早就拿下开城。”他们大嚷大叫：“让炮弹、炸弹和子弹去继续辩论吧！”哪一个开城人听了不义愤填膺呢？有一次，朝中谈判代表团有一个工作人员到德岩里塞村洞去办事，被当地居民看见了。人们马上便传开：“跟美国人当面谈判的人来了！”不一会就有很多人来找这个工作人员，都抢着要把自己的心愿告诉他，嘱咐他“千万不要把开城让给对方”。有的说：“对方如果来夺开城的话，我们老百姓都可以组织起来保卫它！”有一位白发苍苍的老太太也带着一个十二岁的男孩子和一个八岁的女孩子来找他，对他说：“就是我老太婆和小孩子也不能让美国军队再来开城呀！”当人们听到我方代表坚持不让开城的立场和朝中人民部队保卫开城的坚强决心时，人们都微笑了，放下了心。那时敌人已经由砂川河南村洞以南至栗里一线向北进犯，企图攻占我藏山、天德山阵地，进而威胁开城。美国飞机整天价在开城上空嗡嗡地转，炮声常常把人们的房子和会议帐篷震得格格直响。靠近前沿的进凤山北的农民时常在夜中被短促的手榴弹、步枪和机枪声惊醒。然而人们都非常镇定，因为战线在逐渐南移。进凤山麓农民说得好：“仗打了不久，我们便听不到手榴弹声了，后来步枪声也听不见了，渐渐又听不到机枪声了，最后连炮声也疏远了。我们光听这些声音的变化也可知道我们部队正在胜利前进，而和平的日子也就一天一天临近了！”只在美方要求我撤出开城地区和发动“争辩战”后的一个月中，英勇的朝中人民部队便把敌人全部驱逐到砂川河以东和汉江以南，使阵地大大向南推进了，形成西起礼成江，东至板门店，沿汉江北岸、砂川河西岸绵长五十公里的新的阵线。如果再和板门店以东我军阵地连在一起看，过去敌我平行的阵地现在变成“V”字形了。也就是说，在敌人的从汶山至板门店的走廊及其附近地区的两旁都是我军的阵地了。从前被称为“开城卫兵”的进凤山，现在已是远离前沿阵地二十多公里的巩固后方了。此后，开城前    线的主要战斗已经是在板门店会场区东侧、临津江右岸、砂川河畔一线进行。在那里对方的主力美军陆战队第一师和李军一师经常以成团成营的兵力投入进攻。某次在板门店东北的八八点六高地上，敌人用几十个连以至几个营的兵力向志愿军某连进攻二十多次。在不到五百公尺的地段上，光它轰出的炮弹就有七十多吨钢铁。草木打成灰烬，岩石炸烂数尺深，但是阵地依然屹立！志愿军某部仅经过几次保卫开城的战斗就消灭了一万多敌人，击毁击伤敌人坦克九十七辆，击落击伤敌人飞机九十八架。只因经过几个月全线的及开城前线的战场上的“辩论”，才迫使曾层出不穷地制造破坏协议事件的敌人愿意坐下来恢复谈判，才使美方不能再发动一次较大规模的进攻，也才使美方明白：朝中谈判代表为停战、为坚持协商解决问题的主张而进行辛勤不懈的努力并不是示弱，而是为了人民的愿望、人民的利益。
    今年六月间，当一切迹象已经显示停战在望的时候，我曾访问过开城很多工人、农民、学生、家庭主妇和企业家。那时他们每一个人脸上都呈现着胜利的光辉的喜色。但是给我印象最深刻的是他们无一例外地都谈到对美方破坏协议的可能要提高警惕。果然不久就发生了李承晚破坏关于遣返战俘问题的协议，强迫扣留了我方二万七千多名战俘的事件。开城人民为什么对美方能看得这样透澈呢？那是美方在开城时的历史事实告诉了他们，那是在两年多谈判中敌人无数次破坏协议的行动告诉了他们。两年来美方违犯协议，侵犯开城中立区七百多次，侵犯来凤庄及板门店会场区一百四十多次。这里面包括飞机轰炸、扫射朝中谈判代表团住所，炮击会场区等严重事件。和平战士姚庆祥等同志警卫会场区时被敌人夺去了生命，板门店儿童姜永敦在河边钓鱼时也被敌人夺去了生命。由于对方破坏协议，已有三十多人伤亡。现在在开城还可以到处看见美方破坏会场区的遗迹。板门店的四岁幼儿姜永植，两年前被敌人飞机扫射打伤手肘时还只能哭叫，现在他见了人就伸出手给人看伤疤。他已懂得仇恨。开城人民是从自己切身经历里懂得对敌人要提高警惕。但是，开城人民看见了一件更重要的历史事实：美李军打了三年仗的结果，徒然损伤百万生命（其中美军占三十八万多），还只能在原地停了下来。去年秋季美李军为了打上甘岭两个小山头，就攻了一个多月，死伤二万五千人，寸步未能前进。而朝中人民部队在今年七月十三日到十八日，仅六天便前进了一九二点二平方公里，消灭两万六千多名敌人。现在在停战谈判已经签字的时候，李承晚还在继续叫嚣破坏停战。“政治会议”还没有召开，他们便“预料”不能解决问题，准备三个月后继续打。但是这些“英雄”们当真这样健忘吗？殷鉴不远，不用到三八线北，就在开城，战争的教训难道还不够清楚吗？
