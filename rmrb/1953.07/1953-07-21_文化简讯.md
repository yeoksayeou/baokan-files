    Shanghai Commemorates the 60th Anniversary of Mayakovsky's Birth
    The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles jointly held a commemoration meeting for the 60th anniversary of the birth of the great Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky at the Shanghai Art Theater on the 19th. More than 700 people attended the commemoration, including Shanghai literary and art workers Xia Yan, Zhang JinYi, Ba Jin, Liu Simu, Wei Jinzhi, Xu Jie, Ye Yiqun, and Vice President of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Li Zhaohuan. More than ten representatives from the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in Shanghai also attended the commemoration.
    The commemoration meeting began with a presentation by Xia Yan, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, on Mayakovsky's life and achievements, followed by a speech by Pogozhin, a representative from the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in Shanghai. Mayakovsky's work "Good!" was recited at the meeting. Finally, the Soviet film "Mayakovsky Documentary Biography" and the color film "Steppe Poet Jambyl" were screened.
    Students in Major Universities and Colleges in Northeast China Universally Begin Summer Internships
    Summer internships for students in universities and colleges in Northeast China have universally begun. According to statistics from Harbin Institute of Technology, Northeast Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Technology, Northeast Normal University, Northeast Agricultural College, and Shenyang Agricultural College, more than 9,700 students are participating in the internships. The internship period is one to three months. Northeast Institute of Technology has organized inspection teams to various internship factories and mines to check the internship results.
    The students participating in the internships are enthusiastic and hardworking, and generally able to go into the field and learn from the masses, and are welcomed and helped by their internship units. Many internship students have made friends with workers and farmers. Students from Dalian Institute of Technology interning at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, with the support and help of the company's leadership and employees, not only obtained the necessary materials for their graduation thesis design but also accumulated production technical data for the factory workshop. Students from the Animal Husbandry Department of Northeast Agricultural College interning at Baoquanling State-owned Mechanical Farm helped the farm improve its feeding methods, increasing milk production in dairy cows. The biggest gain for the internship students from Northeast Normal University is the further establishment and consolidation of their ideas of serving the education cause. They saw the middle school students' earnest hope and respect for them, deeply realized the glory of being a people's teacher, and expressed their intention to dedicate their lives to the education cause.
    The First Batch of Production Internships for Students at Zhejiang University Concludes
    The first batch of production internships for students at Zhejiang University concluded in early July. The first batch of interns included 110 first-year students from the Metalworking and Metalworking Tool specializations. The content was mainly introductory internships, appropriately combined with professional internships. The internship location was the state-owned Zhejiang Iron Factory.
    From the beginning of the internship preparations, Zhejiang University paid great attention to securing the support and help of the factory. The university originally planned to start the production internships in mid-July, but at that time, the Zhejiang Iron Factory had heavy production tasks and could not accommodate a large number of interns. After obtaining the approval of the East China Higher Education Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Higher Education, Zhejiang University postponed the courses of the two classes preparing to intern at the iron factory and moved the production internships forward to mid-June. Before the start of the internships, the director of the Zhejiang Iron Factory, Cui Ziming, and two deputy directors went to Zhejiang University for liaison, and jointly organized a production internship guidance committee, chaired by the factory's first deputy director, with representatives from various relevant departments within the factory participating. Each department accepting interns was assigned an experienced staff member by the factory director to provide explanations and worked with the instructors to develop detailed internship plans before the internship. In addition to regular introductions and explanations, the factory also organized two technical seminars for the students, where experienced workers and technicians introduced their work and answered questions raised by the students. Workers and technicians were very enthusiastic in helping the students, often using their rest time to explain again and again.
    In the more than half a month of interning at the Zhejiang Iron Factory, the Zhejiang University students not only consolidated the knowledge they had learned in the classroom in the past but also laid the foundation for future professional studies. Ding Kaoshan, a student from the Metalworking specialization, always felt that he could not fully understand the complex machine structures he was studying, and he was often worried that he would not be able to learn well in his future professional studies. After this internship, he understood everything clearly, and he said happily: "After this internship, I am not afraid of studying my major." The instructors and students participating in the internship often helped workers calculate and answer some theoretical questions during the internship process, and put forward some suggestions for improvement in technical design, technical operation, technical management, and labor protection, which were welcomed by the factory. The factory adopted the method of improving the operation of the centerless grinder proposed by instructor Wu Minda, which increased the rate by 10% and also improved the product quality. In order to strengthen technical cooperation between the two parties, Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Iron Factory decided to establish regular contacts after the production internship, and many workers and students are also preparing to communicate frequently and exchange experiences in production and learning.

    东北各大、专学校学生普遍开始暑期实习
    东北区各大学和专科学校学生暑期实习已普遍开始。据哈尔滨工业大学、东北工学院、大连工学院、东北师范大学、东北农学院和沈阳农学院等学校统计，参加实习的学生共有九千七百多名。实习时间是一个月到三个月。东北工学院已组织检查组到各实习厂矿检查实习效果。
    各校参加实习的学生热情努力，一般都能深入实际向群众学习，受到所在实习单位的欢迎和帮助。许多实习学生都和工人、农民交了朋友。大连工学院在鞍山钢铁公司实习的学生，由于得到了该公司领导上和职工的支持与帮助，实习中不但获得了做毕业论文设计的必要资料，而且也给工厂车间积累了生产技术资料。在宝泉岭国营机械农场实习的东北农学院畜牧系的学生，帮助农场改进了饲养方法，使奶牛产奶量增加。东北师范大学的实习学生，在实习中的最大收获是进一步树立和巩固了为教育事业服务的思想。他们看到中学生们对他们的殷切的希望与尊重，深刻体会到作人民教师的光荣，他们表示要把自己的一生贡献给教育事业。
    浙江大学学生第一批生产实习结束
    浙江大学学生第一批生产实习已在七月上旬结束。参加第一批生产实习的是金工和金工工具两个专修科一年级的学生，共一百十人，内容以认识实习为主，适当结合专业实习，实习地点是国营浙江铁工厂。
    从开始准备实习起，浙江大学就很注意争取工厂方面的支持和帮助。该校原来计划在七月中旬开始生产实习，但那时浙江铁工厂有繁重的生产任务，无法容纳大批学生实习。浙江大学征得中央人民政府高等教育部华东高等教育管理局同意后，把准备到铁工厂实习的两个班级的课程挪后，把生产实习提前到六月中旬开始。在实习开始以前，浙江铁工厂的厂长崔子明和两个副厂长曾一起到浙江大学进行联系，并共同组织了生产实习指导委员会，由工厂第一副厂长担任主任委员，厂内各有关部门都有代表参加。每一个接受实习的部门，都由厂长指派有经验的工作人员担任讲解，并在实习前和指导教师一起制定详细的实习计划。除了经常的介绍讲解以外，该厂还为学生组织了两次技术座谈会，由有经验的工人和技术员介绍他们的工作情况，并回答学生所提出的问题。工人、技术员们都非常热心帮助学生，常常利用休息时间，一遍又一遍地讲解。
    到浙江铁工厂实习的浙江大学学生在下厂实习的半个多月中间，不但巩固了过去从课堂上学到的知识，并且为以后的专业学习打下了基础。金工专修科学生丁考山过去在学习比较复杂的机器的构造时，总觉得不能完全理解，他因此常常担心以后的专业学习学不好，这次实习后都清楚了，他很高兴地说：“经过这次实习，学习专业不怕了”。参加实习的指导教师和学生们，在实习过程中时常帮助工人计算和解答一些理论上的问题，并在技术设计、技术操作、技术管理和劳动保护方面提出了一些改进意见，受到工厂的欢迎。指导教师吴敏达所提出的改进无心磨床操作方法，经工厂采纳后，速率提高了百分之十，产品质量也提高了。为了加强双方的技术合作，在生产实习结束后，浙江大学和浙江铁工厂决定建立经常的联系，许多工人和学生也都准备经常通信，交流生产和学习方面的经验。
