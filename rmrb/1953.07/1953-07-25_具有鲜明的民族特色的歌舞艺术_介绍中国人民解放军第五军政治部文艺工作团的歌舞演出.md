Song and Dance Art with Distinct National Characteristics
    ——Introducing the Song and Dance Performance of the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Fifth Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Zhu Shulan
    The Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Fifth Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army came to Beijing from the remote border region of Xinjiang and received a warm welcome from the capital's audience. Their programs not only expressed the determination of soldiers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to love the motherland and defend the border, but also expressed the infinite love and respect of the people of all ethnic groups for Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.
    From their rich and colorful song and dance art, it can be seen that under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, they have inherited the excellent artistic traditions of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and on this basis, they have begun to create art that expresses the new, people's struggle life.
    The Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Fifth Army was established in February 1950. This young cultural team was reorganized on the basis of the Cultural Troupe of the General Headquarters of the former Xinjiang National Army (the predecessor of the Fifth Army) and the cultural work teams of its subordinate units. The troupe members include literary and art workers from ten ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Russian, Tatar, Kirgiz, Solon, Xibe, Mongolian, and Hui. This cultural troupe marks the unity of literary and art workers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the convergence of their excellent song and dance art. Although there are still some language barriers between the audience and the performers, it does not hinder our understanding and love of the song and dance art of these fraternal ethnic groups. Their performances truly express the beautiful, cheerful, enthusiastic, and healthy emotional characteristics of these fraternal ethnic groups. Their feelings of singing praises of the motherland, singing praises of Chairman Mao, and singing praises of the Communist Party are the same as those of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Listen: the Communist Party leads us to turn over and be liberated, and the various ethnic groups on the border are happily living a life of festive joy.
     The lark in the garden sings happily,
     The great leader has opened up a bright road for us.
    And in the lyrics of the " Dolan Dance" (a Uyghur classical collective dance), they also expose the ugly faces of the reactionary rulers before liberation:
         The Bek and Xiangyue (i.e., the village head) levy exorbitant taxes,
         The lackeys bully people.
         The bad guys in the old society,
         Turn right and wrong and make absurd judgments.
    Precisely because they suffered such pain under the evil old system, they can appreciate the happiness and preciousness of the new society and the new life:
    The lark that has not been cold,
    Does not know the warmth of spring,
    People who have not suffered,
    Do not know the kindness of others.
    What a truly touching heartfelt voice.
    All the programs of the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Fifth Army have distinct national styles and border colors. Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic region, and it is also a place with abundant products and beautiful scenery. The thirteen ethnic groups living here are all good at singing and dancing. The members of this military cultural troupe are all children of the people of all ethnic groups, and they have concentrated the excellent songs and dances of the people of all ethnic groups. It is on such a solid foundation of national song and dance that they have created new art that reflects the real struggle life in conjunction with current political tasks. A more prominent program is their newly created "Celebrating the Water Release Ceremony of the Fortieth Regiment Canal" (Uyghur song and dance). It shows the frontier soldiers of all ethnic groups who love the people and love labor, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, helping the people develop production and celebrating the water release ceremony after digging and repairing canals in the Gobi Desert. This creation fully reflects our flesh-and-blood relationship between the army and the people. The laboring masses from all sides flocked to the newly built canal with the soldiers, and a female soldier solemnly and enthusiastically recited the congratulatory speech, followed by the masses singing and dancing to put glory flowers on the models, and in the sound of ethnic musical instruments such as the long trumpet and suona, the ribbon was cut, and the crowd excitedly and heartily sang and danced along the canal. This group dance well expresses the characteristics of Uyghur classical dance and folk dance, and also expresses the mood of the booming new life.
    Their classical programs, such as "The First Section of the First Section of the Twelve Mukams" (Uyghur classical music), show the excellent traditions of the culture and art of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, with rich music, beautiful melodies, and healthy, powerful, bright, and lively dance postures. This is the crystallization of the wisdom and labor of countless folk artists over the years. "Twelve Mukams" (meaning model suite) is a classic piece of music of the Uyghur people, which is said to have been created and developed in Kashgar (the old capital of the Uyghurs, located in southern Xinjiang) two hundred years ago; the entire piece of music is divided into twelve sections, containing about one hundred and seventy-seven songs. These are the works of the great Uyghur poet Molabilal and the great Uzbek poet Navoi. The poems are full of the people's resistance and anger towards feudal rule, singing the people's labor and their desire for a bright future. People put these verses in their favorite folk songs and continue to enrich them, passing them down from generation to generation.
    All the performances of the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Fifth Army give the audience a very real impression, making people feel as if they are not performing on the stage, but on a clear holiday, in a field or forest bathed in warm sunshine, people wearing beautiful national costumes, singing and dancing heartily in the square. They performed so truly and movingly; their simple and joyful emotions deeply infected every audience. People will not forget the "Hand Drum Dance" performed by Zuhara and Yassen and the "Uzbek Dance" performed by Qiman克斯, their beautiful and healthy dance postures show the joy of labor and the full and enthusiastic emotions. Similarly, people cannot forget the wisdom and humor of the working people shown by Abulahan and Abdul Guri in the "Black Horse" (Uyghur classical singing). "Beautiful Motherland" (Uyghur folk song and dance) is also exciting and lovely. The reason why these performers are so simple and lovely is that they not only come from the working people, but most of them are also excellent soldiers among the working people, and they can deeply appreciate the noble qualities of the people. Each of them has the true qualities of a folk artist, able to play, sing, and dance, and their development prospects are unlimited.
    To develop national song and dance art, we must not only create on the basis of our own national traditions, but also learn and absorb the excellent art of other ethnic groups to enrich this creation. Judging from the performances of the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Fifth Army, their artistic path is very broad. Their programs not only include excellent classical and new folk songs and dances of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, but also sing Han Chinese songs such as "I Am a Soldier", "Singing Erlang Mountain", and new Soviet mass songs "Moscow-Beijing" and Soviet military songs "Sunset". Their performances are all satisfactory.
    This young cultural team, established only three years ago, has grown up in struggle. They often go deep into the masses and are closely linked with the masses' struggle life. They have vigorously publicized the Party's ethnic policies to the people and carried out anti-US aggression and aid Korea propaganda activities; when the troops turned to large-scale production, they went deep into the construction sites. Their lives and work are very stressful. In the more than one month since the entire troupe of fifty-six people came to Beijing, they not only completed nearly thirty performances, but also learned seventeen programs from fraternal groups in the capital and listened to special reports on literary and artistic thought, music, and dance. This spirit of hard study is very valuable.
    We believe that in hard study and practice, they will surely achieve greater gains in reflecting the life of the troops, expressing the characteristics of the life of the troops, creating the heroic image of revolutionary soldiers and the unique style of revolutionary troops, and further improve the existing artistic level and develop the new national song and dance of the troops.

    具有鲜明的民族特色的歌舞艺术
    ——介绍中国人民解放军第五军政治部文艺工作团的歌舞演出
    朱树兰
    中国人民解放军第五军政治部文艺工作团从祖国遥远的边疆新疆来到北京演出，受到了首都观众热烈的欢迎。他们的节目不仅表现了新疆各族战士热爱祖国、保卫边疆的决心，而且表达了各族人民对毛主席和中国共产党的无限热爱和崇敬。
    从他们所表演的丰富多彩的歌舞艺术中，可以看出，在毛泽东文艺思想的光辉的照耀下，他们继承了新疆各民族优秀的艺术传统，而且在这一基础上，开始在创造表现新的、人民的斗争生活的艺术。
    第五军政治部文艺工作团成立于一九五○年二月。这一支年青的文艺队伍，是在原新疆民族军
    （第五军的前身）总指挥部文艺工作团和所属各部队的文艺工作队的基础上整编起来的。团员包括维吾尔、哈萨克、乌兹别克、俄罗斯、塔塔尔、柯尔克兹、索伦、锡伯、蒙族和回族等十个民族的文艺工作者。这个文艺工作团标志了新疆各民族文艺工作者的团结和他们优秀的歌舞艺术的汇集。尽管观众和表演者在语言上还有一些隔阂，却丝毫没有妨碍我们对这些兄弟民族歌舞艺术的理解和热爱。他们的表演真实地表现了这些兄弟民族的优美、明朗、热情和健康的感情特征。他们歌颂祖国、歌颂毛主席、歌颂共产党的心情，是和全国各族人民相同的。听吧：共产党领导我们翻身解放，边疆各民族愉快地过着盛节般的欢乐生活。
     花园里的百灵鸟愉快地歌唱，
     伟大的领袖给我们开辟了光明的道路。而在“道郎舞”（维吾尔族古典集体舞）的歌词中，他们又揭露了解放前的反动统治者的丑恶面目：
         伯克乡约（即村长）横征暴敛，
         喽罗们仗势欺人。
         旧社会的坏人们，
         颠倒是非，作出荒谬的判决。
    正因为他们在万恶的旧制度下受过那样的痛苦，所以他们能够体会到新社会、新生活的幸福和可贵：
    没有受过寒冷的百灵鸟，
    不知道春天的温暖，
    没有受过苦的人，
    不知道别人的恩情。
    这是多么真切动人的心声。
    第五军政治部文艺工作团的全部节目，都具有显明的民族风格和边疆色彩。新疆是一个多民族的地区，也是一个物产丰富、风景秀丽的地方。居住在这里的十三个民族大都能歌善舞。这个部队文艺工作团的团员们都是各族人民的子弟，他们将各民族人民的优秀歌舞集中起来了。就在这样的民族歌舞的坚实基础上，他们结合当前的政治任务，创造了反映现实斗争生活的新艺术。比较突出的一个节目，是他们新创作的“欢庆四十团渠放水典礼”（维吾尔族歌舞）。它表现了热爱人民、热爱劳动的边疆各族战士，在党和人民政府的领导下，帮助人民发展生产，在戈壁沙滩上，挖修了水渠后，举行放水典礼的欢跃情形。这个创作充分反映了我们血肉相连的军民关系。来自各方的劳动群众，簇拥着战士们到了新修的水渠旁，一个女战士庄严而热情地朗诵祝词，接着是群众载歌载舞地给模范带上光荣花，在长喇叭和唢呐等具有民族特色的乐器的演奏声中，剪断了彩带，人流顺着水渠兴奋地、纵情地歌舞。这个集体舞很好地表现了维吾尔族古典舞和民间舞蹈的特色，也表现了蓬蓬勃勃的新生活的情调。
    他们的古典节目，如“十二玛卡姆第一节第一段”（维吾尔族古典乐曲）等，都显示了新疆各民族文化艺术的优秀传统，音乐丰富，旋律优美，舞姿健康有力、明朗轻快。这是许多年来无数民间艺术家的智慧和劳动的结晶。“十二玛卡姆”（模范大曲之意）是一部维吾尔族人民的经典乐曲，据说是在二百年前由喀什噶尔（维吾尔族的旧都，位于新疆南部）创造和发展起来的；全部乐曲共分十二节，包含约一百七十七首曲子。这是维吾尔族大诗人莫拉比拉列和乌兹别克的大诗人纳瓦依两个人的作品。诗歌里充满了人民对封建统治的反抗和愤怒，歌唱了人民的劳动和对光明前途的想望，人们便将这些诗句配在自己心爱的民歌里，并且不断地丰富它，世世代代流传至今。
    第五军政治部文艺工作团的全部表演，都给观众以非常真实的印象，使人觉得他们仿佛不是在舞台上表演，而是在晴朗的假日，在温暖的阳光照耀着的田野上、树林里，人们穿戴着美丽的民族服饰，在广场上纵情地歌舞。他们表演得这样真切动人；他们的纯朴的、欢欣的情绪深深地感染了每一个观众。人们不会忘记左哈拉和雅森表演的“手鼓舞”和其满克斯表演的“乌兹别克舞”，他们优美而健康的舞姿表现了劳动的愉快，和饱满热烈的情绪。同样地，人们也不能忘怀阿不拉汉和阿不都古里在“黑走马”（维吾尔族古典演唱）里，所表现的劳动人民的智慧和风趣。“美丽的祖国”（维吾尔族民间歌舞）也是使人兴奋和喜爱的。这些表演者所以如此朴实、可爱，是因为他们不仅是从劳动人民中来，而且大多数还是劳动人民中的优秀战士，他们能够深刻地体会人民的高贵品质。他们每个人都有着民间艺术家的本色，能弹、能唱、能舞，他们的发展前途是不可限量的。
    发展民族的歌舞艺术，不但要在本民族传统的基础上进行创造，而且要学习和吸收其他民族的优秀艺术来丰富这一创造。从第五军政治部文艺工作团的演出来看，他们的艺术道路是非常宽广的。他们的节目不仅包括了新疆各民族优秀的古典的和新的民间歌舞，也演唱了汉族的“我是一个兵”、“歌唱二郎山”，和新型的苏联群众歌曲“莫斯科——北京”和苏联部队歌曲“太阳落山”。他们的这些表演都是令人满意的。
    这一支年青的文艺队伍，成立不过三年，却是在斗争里成长起来的。他们经常深入群众，和群众的斗争生活紧密地连在一起。他们曾大力地向人民宣传党的民族政策和进行抗美援朝的宣传活动；在部队转入大生产时，他们又深入建设工地。他们的生活和工作都是很紧张的。全团五十六个人，来到北京的一个多月中，不仅完成了将近三十场的演出任务，还向首都的兄弟团体学习了十七个节目，和听取了关于文艺思想、音乐、舞蹈等专题报告。这种刻苦的学习精神是非常可贵的。
    我们相信：他们在刻苦的学习和锻炼中，一定能够在反映部队生活、表现部队生活特征，创造革命军人的英雄形象和革命部队的独特风格等方面取得更大的收获，更进一步提高现有的艺术水平，发展部队的民族新歌舞。（附图片）
