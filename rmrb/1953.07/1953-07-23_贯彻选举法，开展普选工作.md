Implement the Electoral Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage

Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region Pilot Universal Suffrage Townships
Completed Population Census and Voter Registration

The pilot townships for basic-level universal suffrage in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region—Xianzhen (mixed Miao and Han) and Sanchaping (predominantly Miao) in the first district of Jishou County—completed the population census and voter registration in mid-June. As soon as the work team entered the villages, they made sure that the universal suffrage work was closely integrated with production. During the day, they worked in the fields and on the slopes with the masses, conducting propaganda during production. In the evening, they organized Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and activists to study. After the cadres and activists had a correct understanding of the great significance of universal suffrage and the purpose of the population census and voter registration, the work team relied on them to hold various small-scale forums, such as youth associations, women's associations, and elders' associations, to conduct propaganda among the masses. In particular, the form of "pianwu hui" (small group meetings held in private houses) was very popular among the masses. In the villages inhabited by the Miao people, propaganda was also carried out in ethnic forms, cultivating "gelang" (people who can compose and sing well), who combined the universal suffrage policies with the local situation and composed mountain songs that the Miao people loved most, so that the masses sang them widely. The masses reflected, "Chairman Mao's policies have become our songs, easy to understand and easy to remember." Therefore, the masses were universally educated.

The method of population census and voter registration was based on the local population distribution, using mobile registration stations by village. The registration time was in the morning, and the masses registered before eating, and then went to the slopes for production. In this way, it suited the masses' living habits and did not hinder production. Because the masses had already understood the significance of universal suffrage beforehand, every household was able to go to the station for registration on time. On the day of registration in Liao’s Village, men and women sang Miao songs to the station before dawn. After Wu Qiaosheng's wife received her voter registration card, she looked at it again and again, and then took it back and hid it in the red-lacquered box where the land certificate was kept.

Because ideological and organizational preparations were made before and after registration, and the cadres and the masses were clear about the situation, the population census and voter registration were carried out without omissions or duplications.

Basic-level Universal Suffrage Pilot Work Completed in Liaodong and Other Provinces

Liaodong, Jilin, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, and Songjiang provinces have successively completed the pilot work of basic-level universal suffrage. In the pilot work, all provinces, through in-depth and extensive propaganda and education work, fully mobilized the masses and raised their awareness. Therefore, the voters cherished their political rights very much and actively participated in the universal suffrage movement. The voters participating in the election congress in all provinces accounted for more than 80% of the total number of voters, and in Jilin, Liaoxi, and other provinces, it reached more than 90%.

Through the pilot projects, all provinces have gained various experiences in basic-level elections, creating favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of basic-level universal suffrage. The relatively systematic experience in the pilot project of Bianmen District in Fengcheng, Liaodong Province, is: how to conduct propaganda work in combination with the various stages of the universal suffrage work, and how to conduct population census, voter registration, and convening of election congresses in large areas. Songjiang Province has initially gained experience in conducting basic-level universal suffrage in different types of areas such as rural areas, towns, industrial and mining areas, forest areas, and ethnic minority areas as a result of the pilot projects in these areas. It also summarized the experience of mobilizing basic-level cadres to lead the universal suffrage work. For example, Jilin Province gained experience in how to mobilize the masses, especially women, to participate in universal suffrage.

On the basis of fully promoting democracy, all provinces conducted in-depth inspections of the work of basic-level political power and the work style of cadres, thereby achieving the purpose of educating cadres, educating the masses, strengthening the unity between cadres and the masses, and promoting production. Through summarizing and inspecting work, Bianmen District in Fengcheng affirmed the achievements of the work, commended the good cadres, and then pointed out the shortcomings in the cadres' work. The cadres also generally and automatically reviewed their shortcomings, and the masses expressed satisfaction. On this basis, the people's congresses held in all villages in the district focused on solving production problems and discussed various tasks. After the meeting, the representatives went deep into the masses to implement the resolutions of the congress, and the masses launched a production competition to implement the resolutions of the congress. In Shuanghe Village, Yushu, Jilin, more than 140 hectares of land were not planted due to rain in the pilot project, but after the People's Congress was held, the masses of the whole village rushed to plant 124 hectares of land in three days. After universal suffrage, Sanhe Village, Shangzhi, Songjiang mobilized 96 women to go to the fields to weed and thin seedlings, accounting for more than 85% of the female labor force.

At present, the northeastern provinces are training the second batch of universal suffrage work cadres, and some cities and counties are also concentrating on training cadres, actively preparing for the pilot projects and comprehensive development of basic-level universal suffrage in the counties. The cadres trained by the northeastern provinces this time will be the guiding backbone for basic-level universal suffrage in their respective counties.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    湘西苗族自治区普选试办乡
    完成人口调查和选民登记
    湘西苗族自治区基层普选工作试办乡——吉首县一区先镇（苗汉杂居）、三岔坪（苗族聚居）两乡，在六月中旬完成了人口调查与选民登记工作。工作组一入村就注意使普选工作密切结合生产，白天同群众下田上坡，在生产中进行宣传；晚上组织党员、团员、干部、积极分子学习。当干部、积极分子对普选的重大意义和人口调查、选民登记的目的有了正确的认识以后，工作组再依靠他们召开各种小型座谈会，如青年会、妇女会、老人会等，向群众进行宣传。特别是片屋会的形式更受到广大群众欢迎。在苗族居住的寨子，并运用民族形式进行宣传，培养歌郎（编得好、唱得好的人），把普选政策结合当地情况，编成苗族人民最喜爱的山歌，使群众普遍都唱起来。群众反映：“毛主席的政策变成了我们的歌，容易懂，又容易记。”因此群众普遍受到教育。
    人口调查与选民登记的方法，是根据当地人口居住情况，以寨子为单位，采用流动登记站的办法；登记时间在早晨，群众登记好了再吃饭，然后上坡生产。这样，既适合群众生活习惯，又不妨碍生产。因为群众事先已经懂得了普选的意义了，所以家家都能按时到站登记。廖家寨在登记的那天，男男女女还未天亮就唱着苗歌上站去登记了。吴桥生的妻子领到选民证后，看了又看，拿回去藏在放土地证的红漆盒子里。
    因为在登记前后做好了思想准备和组织准备，干部、群众心中有数，所以人口调查和选民登记做到了不遗漏，不重复。（刘黎光）
    辽东等省基层普选试办工作结束
    辽东、吉林、辽西、黑龙江、松江等省已先后结束基层普选典型试办工作。各省在试办工作中，经过深入广泛的宣传教育工作，充分发动了群众，提高了群众的觉悟，因而选民们十分珍重自己的政治权利，积极地参加了普选运动。各省参加选举大会的选民，均占选民总数的百分之八十以上，吉林、辽西等省则达百分之九十以上。
    通过典型试办，各省均取得了基层选举的各种经验，为全面展开基层普选创造了有利条件。辽东省凤城边门区典型试办中比较系统的经验是：如何结合普选工作的各个阶段进行宣传工作，以及在大片地区内如何进行人口调查、选民登记与召开选举大会等。松江省在农村、城镇、工矿、林区、少数民族等不同类型地区试办的结果，初步取得了在不同地区进行基层普选的经验，并总结了发动基层干部领导普选工作的经验；如吉林省取得了如何发动群众，特别是妇女参加普选的经验。
    各省在充分发扬民主的基础上，深入检查了基层政权的工作和干部工作作风，从而达到了教育干部、教育群众、加强干部与群众之间的团结，推动生产的目的。凤城边门区通过总结与检查工作，肯定了工作成绩，表扬了好的干部，然后并指出干部工作中的缺点，干部也普遍自动地检讨了缺点，群众表示满意。在这一基础上，全区各村所召开的人民代表大会，都以解决生产问题为中心，讨论了各项工作。会后，代表们深入群众贯彻大会决议，群众为执行大会决议展开了生产竞赛。吉林榆树双合村在典型试办中，因天雨有一百四十多垧地没有种上，但在开过人民代表大会之后，全村群众在三天内就抢种了一百二十四垧地。松江尚志三合村经过普选，发动了九十六名妇女下地锄草间苗，达妇女劳动力的百分之八十五以上。
    目前，东北各省正分别训练第二批普选工作干部，部分市、县也正集训干部，积极为各县典型试办及全面展开基层普选作好准备工作。东北各省这次训练的干部，都将作为所属各县基层普选的指导骨干。
