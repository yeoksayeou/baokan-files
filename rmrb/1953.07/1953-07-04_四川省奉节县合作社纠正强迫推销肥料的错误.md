Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Letter from the United Cooperative of Fengjie County, Sichuan Province: The criticism made by a reader in the April 29th issue of the newspaper regarding the forced fertilizer sales by our county's cooperatives last year is correct. When promoting ammonium sulfate last year, our cooperative did not repeatedly explain the policy to cadres, but only emphasized completing the task. Although we found that some districts and townships were engaging in coercive practices after assigning tasks, we did not take a serious and earnest attitude to resolutely correct them. Therefore, it encouraged the commandist work style of cadres and created extremely bad effects among the masses. During the cadre training in February this year, our cooperative combined the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline, focusing on reviewing last year's ammonium sulfate promotion work, and unfolded criticism from bottom to top, effectively correcting the commandist work style. When promoting fertilizer this year, we learned from last year's lessons and used methods of in-depth mass publicity and practical education to make farmers consciously and voluntarily purchase fertilizer. Up to now, the county has sold more than 150,000 jin of ammonium sulfate.

    四川省奉节县合作社纠正强迫推销肥料的错误
    四川省奉节县合作社联合社来信：四月二十九日报上刊载读者对我县合作社去年强迫推销肥料问题提出的批评是正确的。我社去年推广硫酸錏时，没有向干部反复交待政策，而只强调完成任务；在布置任务后虽然检查出有的区乡产生强迫命令的做法，但也没有采取严肃认真的态度坚决纠正。因此，助长了干部强迫命令的作风，在群众中造成了极端不良的影响。我社在今年二月份集训干部时，结合开展了反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争，着重检查去年推广硫酸錏工作，并自下而上地展开了批评，有效地纠正了强迫命令作风。今年推销肥料工作时，我们接受了去年的教训，用深入群众反复宣传和实际教育的方法，使农民自觉自愿购买肥料。截至目前为止，全县已推销硫酸錏十五万余斤。
