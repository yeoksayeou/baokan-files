Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 17th: The United Nations Economic and Social Council continued its general debate on the economic development of backward countries on July 15th and 16th. The Egyptian representative emphasized the importance of increasing agricultural production for the economic development of backward countries. He urged the Economic and Social Council to note that merely increasing agricultural production is clearly not enough; it is also necessary to implement land reform and improve the marketing conditions for agricultural products (such as expanding foreign trade).

The Venezuelan representative emphasized the importance of expanding normal foreign trade to promote the economic development of backward countries.

The Indian representative, Sain, was the first to speak at the morning meeting on July 16th. He expressed great satisfaction with the Soviet representative's statement announcing that the Soviet Union would participate in the United Nations' broad technical assistance program for the economic development of backward countries, and would allocate 4 million rubles in 1953 as funding for technical assistance. The Indian representative said, "We welcome this decision, not only because the increase in technical assistance funding is a very welcome thing, but also because this decision proves the Soviet government's policy of international friendly cooperation and proves the Soviet Union's willingness to provide assistance to the economic development of backward countries." He said that any criticisms made by the Soviet representative of the past work of the United Nations Technical Assistance Administration would be considered in order to improve the work of the Technical Assistance Administration.

The Philippine representative pointed out that the economies of backward countries can be developed if there is broad international cooperation. He also emphasized the close relationship between the economic development of backward countries and the employment situation in industrialized countries. He added that, in this regard, the development of reciprocal trade is very important.

The representative of Chile, which is not a member of the Economic and Social Council, also spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that the reduction in trade volume has further worsened the already difficult economic situation of backward countries. He said that the decline in the prices of exports from backward countries and the rise in the prices of imports have had a negative impact on the financial situation of backward countries.

The representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Changsheng, said that the Council is discussing the issue of assistance to backward countries, which is a very important issue for the working people of the world. He said that experience has proven that foreign investment in backward countries has not provided a solution to this problem. In this regard, Liu Changsheng cited two obvious examples. He explained that in Venezuela, Pakistan, Morocco, and French Guinea, despite the large influx of foreign capital, their economic situation is deteriorating and the living standards of the people are declining, while the profits extracted by foreign monopoly capital in these countries are increasing. He said that the second example is the People's Republic of China, which, after freeing itself from the oppression of foreign capital and implementing many social reforms, has made great achievements in developing the national economy and improving the material and cultural conditions of all the people.

Liu Changsheng also pointed out that the result of foreign capital inflow is often to perpetuate the imbalance of economic development in backward countries, because foreign monopoly capital is trying to maintain the economic backwardness of these countries in order to extract the maximum profit.

Liu Changsheng said that the Soviet government's decision to allocate funds for technical assistance to backward countries is an important and practical contribution to the economic development of those countries. He concluded by saying that in order to promote the economic development of backward countries, it is necessary to eliminate obstacles to the normal development of international trade, implement social reforms, especially land reform, and ensure that the national economy, especially industry, is universally developed.

The Belgian representative tried hard in his speech to prove that "favorable conditions" should be created for foreign investment in backward countries. However, he had to admit that the profits obtained by foreign investors have greatly exceeded the amount of investment.

The Argentine representative spoke about the difficult economic situation of backward countries and said that it is completely wrong to regard foreign capital as the basis for developing the economies of backward countries. Experience shows that foreign capital hinders and obstructs the economic development of those countries. He also opposed using the Council to spread the argument that "favorable conditions" must be created for foreign capital.

    世界工联代表刘长胜在联合国经社理事会会议上发言
    欢迎苏联政府拨款对落后国家作技术援助
    【新华社讯】塔斯社日内瓦十七日电：联合国经社理事会七月十五、十六日继续进行关于落后国家经济发展问题的一般辩论。埃及代表着重指出了增加农业生产对于落后国家经济发展的重要性。他促请经社理事会注意：仅是增加农业生产显然不够，实行土地改革和改善农产品销售条件（例如扩大对外贸易）也是必要的。
    委内瑞拉代表着重指出了扩大正常的对外贸易以促进落后国家经济发展的重要性。
    印度代表塞恩在七月十六日上午会议上第一个发言。他对苏联代表的发言表示十分满意，苏联代表宣布苏联将参加联合国对落后国家经济发展的广泛的技术援助计划，并在一九五三年拨款四百万卢布作为技术援助的经费。印度代表说，我们欢迎这个决定，不仅因为技术援助经费的增加是一件很可喜的事情，而且因为这个决定证明了苏联政府的国际友好合作政策，证明了苏联愿意给落后国家的经济发展以援助。他说，苏联代表对联合国技术援助局过去的工作提出的任何批评将得到考虑，以便改进技术援助局的工作。
    菲律宾代表指出，如果有广泛的国际合作，落后国家的经济是能够得到发展的。他还着重指出了落后国家经济发展和工业国家中就业状况的密切关系。他又说，在这方面，互惠贸易的发展是很重要的。
    不是经社理事会理事国的智利代表也在会上发言。他着重指出，贸易量的缩减使落后国家已经十分困难的经济情况更加恶化。他说，落后国家出口货价格的下跌和进口货价格的上涨对于落后国家的财政情况产生了恶劣的影响。
    世界工会联合会代表刘长胜说，理事会正在讨论对落后国家的援助问题，这是对全世界劳动人民十分重要的一个问题。他说，经验证明，外国在落后国家的投资并没有提供解决这个问题的办法。在这方面，刘长胜举了两个明显的例子。他说明，在委内瑞拉、巴基斯坦、摩洛哥和法属几内亚，尽管外国资本大量输入，它们的经济情况还是在恶化中，人民的生活水平还在下降，而外国垄断资本在这些国家中榨取的利润却越来越多了。他说，第二个例子是中华人民共和国，它在摆脱了外国资本的压迫、实行了许多社会改革后，在发展国民经济和改善全体人民的物质和文化条件方面取得了极大的成就。
    刘长胜还指出，外国资本输入的结果往往是使落后国家经济发展的不平衡性继续保持下去，因为外国垄断资本竭力要保持这些国家经济的落后状态，以便他们榨取最大限度的利润。
    刘长胜说，苏联政府拨出款项充作对落后国家技术援助经费的决定对于那些国家的经济发展是一个重要的、实际的贡献。他最后说，为了促进落后国家的经济发展，必须取消对于国际贸易正常发展的障碍，必须实行社会改革，尤其是土地改革，并确使国民经济，首先是工业得到普遍发展。
    比利时代表竭力想在发言中证明应该为外国在落后国家投资创造“有利条件”。但是，他又不得不承认，外国投资者所获得的利润已经大大超过了投资的数目。
    阿根廷代表谈到落后国家经济的困难情况，他说，把外国资本当作发展落后国家经济的基础是十分错误的。经验说明，外国资本妨碍、阻挠了那些国家的经济发展。他也反对利用理事会来散播什么必须为外国资本创造“有利条件”的论调。
