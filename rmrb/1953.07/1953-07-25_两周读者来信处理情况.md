Reader Letters Processing Situation in Two Weeks

From July 6th to July 19th, our newspaper's reader letters group received a total of 2,540 reader letters and the various authorities replied to 666 reader letters. Among them, 1,105 were related to political and legal issues, 1,132 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 889 were related to cultural and educational issues, and 80 were of other nature. Fifty were published in the newspaper, 1,100 were answered individually, 1,591 were forwarded to relevant authorities for reference, study, processing, or reply, and 857 were retained by the newspaper for reference or did not require further processing; some of these processed letters were those left over from before. During the same period, our newspaper's reader letters group sent out a total of 3,997 letters replying to readers, forwarding letters to relevant authorities for study and processing, and urging action.

In the past two weeks, many readers have reflected in their letters that since the launch of the anti-bureaucracy struggle, the work of handling people's letters in party and government organs in various places has generally improved, thereby strengthening the connection between the Party and the People's Government and the people; however, some readers' letters also exposed that some units are still doing a very poor job in handling people's letters. We are studying and processing the above letters and preparing to select some for publication. In addition to hoping that readers will continue to write to us reflecting the above situation, we also hope that comrades in various organs who are responsible for handling letters will write to us to report their work experience and the problems they encounter in their work.

Several reader letters reflect that some basic construction units lack a unified plan when carrying out land purchase, house purchase, material preparation, and material transportation in the suburbs of cities. Some units measure, plant stakes, and draw circles everywhere without the introduction of the local People's Government, thereby harming the interests of the masses, causing farmers anxiety, and even affecting local social order. This is a problem worthy of attention, and we are studying it. Currently, there are also reader letters reflecting the overlapping of institutions and excessive personnel in some units, and we are studying this with relevant parties. We hope that readers will continue to write to us reflecting the situation regarding the above issues.

Some readers also revealed in their letters the serious waste of wood in some units, the chaotic phenomena of some enterprises violating labor policies in hiring and dismissing temporary workers, the situation of some industrial, mining, and construction units neglecting worker safety and causing casualties, and reflected some problems arising from the adjustment of the scope and methods of transporting goods as parcels by the Ministry of Railways; we are studying and processing all of the above problems.

Many rural cadres and farmers have written to inquire about methods for preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests. In addition to asking the Plant Protection Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture to publicly answer questions in the newspaper about the prevention and control of several major insect pests, we have asked specialized agencies to reply to readers individually.

In addition, in the past two weeks, we have also received some reader letters reflecting some problems in the lives and production of fishermen and salt workers. We have rarely received letters in this regard in the past. In order to strengthen the connection between the newspaper and the masses of fishermen and salt workers in the future, we hope that relevant readers will reflect more problems in this regard to us.

    两周读者来信处理情况
    七月六日至十九日两周中，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信二千五百四十件，各机关答复读者信六百六十六件。其中有关政法问题的一千一百零五件，有关工农业生产和财经问题的一千一百三十二件，有关文教问题的八百八十九件，其它性质的八十件。在报上发表的五十件，个别答复读者的一千一百件，转请各有关机关参考、研究、处理或答复的一千五百九十一件，留存本报参考或不需再作处理的八百五十七件；这些处理的来信中，有一部分是以前留下的。同一时期中，本报读者来信组共发出答复读者、转请有关机关研究处理和催办信共三千九百九十七件。
    两周来，不少读者在来信中反映：自从反官僚主义斗争开展以来，各地党政机关处理人民来信的工作一般都有了改进，从而加强了党和人民政府与人民群众的联系；但是还有一些读者来信揭发某些单位对处理人民来信工作仍然做得很差。以上来信，我们正在研究处理，准备选择一部分发表。我们除希望读者继续来信反映上述情况外，并且希望各机关做处理来信工作的同志来信报告他们的工作经验和在工作中所遇到的问题。
    有几封读者来信反映：某些基本建设单位，在城市郊区进行购地、买房、备工和运料等工作时缺乏统一计划，有的不经当地人民政府的介绍而私自到处测量、栽桩、划圈，以致损害群众利益，引起农民不安，甚至影响当地社会秩序。这是一个值得注意的问题，我们正在研究。现在还有读者来信反映某些单位机构重叠、人员过多的情况，我们正和有关方面研究。以上问题，我们希望读者继续来信反映情况。
    还有一些读者在来信中揭发了某些单位使用木材方面的严重浪费现象，揭发某些企业单位在雇用和解雇临时工方面的违犯劳动政策等混乱现象，揭发某些工矿和建筑单位忽视工人安全、造成伤亡事故的情况，反映铁道部调整货物按包裹运输的范围和办法后产生的一些问题；以上问题，我们都正在研究处理。
    不少农村干部和农民来信询问农作物病虫害防治方法，我们除已请中央农业部植物保护司在报上公开答复了关于几种主要虫害的防治方法外，其余即请专门机关个别答复读者。
    此外，两周来我们还收到一些读者来信，反映有关渔民、盐民生活和生产中的一些问题。我们过去很少收到这方面的来信，今后为了加强报纸和渔民、盐民群众的联系，我们希望有关读者更多地向我们反映这方面的问题。
