    On the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Line

    "The motherland is building so fast! Look, in such a desolate place, there are so many bulldozers and new road-building machines. We who have been away from the motherland for more than two years really couldn't have imagined this!"
    Xu Jia'yi, a second-class combat hero of the Volunteer Army who had just recovered from hospital, said excitedly. Around him sat the male and female bulldozer operators and their families who had come off shift. In front of them was the Haxi River Beach construction site of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. Groups of bulldozers roared, pushing away large earthworks half a zhang high, raising dust several zhang high, and creating flat avenues where there had been rugged ground.
    "For more than two years, we dug landmines under the enemy's noses and built bridges in knee-deep icy rivers. No one complained or said they were tired. Everyone believed that this was paving the way for the construction of the motherland and building bridges for the construction of the motherland. During rest, some people always liked to draw a map of the motherland in pencil and then draw red lines on the map, and then say: 'This is the railway in front of my house.' I remembered Comrade Wang Ying, a young man who was very brave in battle and very cheerful in peacetime. If he were alive now and saw this kind of railway construction, he would have pounded his knees and shouted loudly. He was from Chengdu. Once he received a letter from his fiancée, which said: 'We Sichuanese have been waiting for 40 years for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to start construction. The train is about to pass by our door. How wonderful!' One night he dreamed of a train, chugging along, arriving at his door. He shouted that he wanted to chase after it, waking up the comrades sleeping next to him."
    "Unfortunately, he sacrificed himself not long after!" Xu Jia'yi's tone became heavy, and the people around him listening appeared particularly tense. "That was during the Battle of Maliangshan in 1951. Our company's task was to dig fortifications in the area where the enemy's firepower was concentrated. The superiors stipulated that each squad had five hours to dig two positions, while the eighth squad led by Comrade Wang Ying dug the first position in only 103 minutes. At this time, the enemy discovered them and concentrated their firepower on them. Comrade Wang Ying's buttocks were wounded by shrapnel, and blood flowed. Everyone wanted him to go down, but he just shook his head. Then his left arm was blown off. The stretcher team came up to carry him, but he still refused to go down, saying, 'I have to persevere to the end even with one hand!' Just as the second position was about to be dug, Comrade Wang Ying was seriously injured for the third time and gloriously sacrificed himself. Before he died, he handed over the only 300 Korean won he had to the instructor, saying that he wanted to dedicate it to the motherland for construction! Soon, the higher-level Party committee approved the posthumous recognition of Comrade Wang Ying as a member of the Communist Party of China. Not long after, the train he had dreamed of day and night also reached his doorstep. Now, the new Tianshui-Chengdu Railway is extending its hand to the northwest, and it is about to shake hands with our Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway here." Speaking of this, Xu Jia'yi's tone gradually became excited. After a slight pause, he repeated with regret: "If Comrade Wang Ying were still alive, how happy he would be!"

    We left the Haxi River Beach construction site and continued towards Niaoshaling. The scenes along the way were encouraging everywhere. We saw trains loaded with bridge-laying machines and cranes heading towards Yongdeng, and we saw trains loaded with petroleum from the Yumen Oilfield leaving Longquansi Station for Lanzhou. As soon as the Yellow River leaves the railway bridge, it enters the steep Dashan Gorge, and the water becomes even tighter. The sun shines on the water surface, emitting brilliant golden light, and the wheat waves on both sides of the Yellow River are also rising and falling like the Yellow River, radiating golden light. Next to the dense orchards, the Yellow River waterwheels, unique to the Northwest, are carting river water to the fertile land on both sides. The滔滔 water of the Yellow River is constantly covered by the sound of trains passing over the 便 bridge. We also saw more than a dozen sheepskin rafts sailing on the Yellow River, and it seemed that people were conducting hydrographic surveys on the rafts. I said: "The Ministry of Fuel Industry has sent people to survey the upper reaches of the Yellow River; the Gansu Provincial Department of Industry is also preparing to send people to measure one hundred kilometers each in the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River this year. They are all looking for the best location for the largest hydroelectric power plant in the Northwest in the future!"
    "The Yellow River is so beautiful today!" Comrade Xu Jia'yi became excited again, patted my shoulder and said, "The ideal of the Yellow River Hydropower Station will definitely be realized. In the future, large factories will also be opened in those loess mountains, and perhaps many cities will appear here. In places where it used to be pitch black at night, it will become like Chongqing at night with thousands of lights!"
    The car moved forward along the foot of a large stone mountain, and we saw workers tied with ropes around their waists, chiseling stone in mid-air near the majestic mountaintop. At this time, I opened the photos I had just taken on the Tianshui-Chengdu and Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway lines and showed them to him. I told him some things that moved me. A concrete squad leader of a joint engineering team, named Song Yangshu, on July 10th last year, it rained heavily, and his wife and children were washed away by the flood. The workers in the neighborhood went to rescue them, and they also sent people to the construction site to call him. He hesitated for a moment, but still continued to desperately rescue the six thousand bags of cement in the tunnel. As a result, his child was drowned, and his wife's optic nerve was damaged. But when I went to visit him, he first said: "Good, the cement has been rescued, and the project ahead will not be delayed." Also, I recently went to the Yumen Oilfield. In order to fully supply the national petroleum needs after the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is completed, new wells are being drilled there, and dead wells are being revived. At an oil worker symposium, a worker from Sichuan said: "In the future, I will take a train and return to my doorstep without taking a step. Our Sichuan's three-harvest rice and 300 yuan a pound of sweet Guanggan will also take a train to our mining area. The future will be so beautiful!"
    "Yes, the future is really beautiful!" Comrade Xu Jia'yi obviously felt that what the worker said was exactly what he wanted to say.
    Truck after truck carrying engineering personnel and building materials are driving towards the highlands 3,000 meters above sea level. Gradually, our car also circled to the top of the mountain, and our breathing slowly became a little suffocated; the weather gradually became colder. On both sides of the car, green grass and grazing sheep began to appear, and gradually purple-blue small flowers spread all over the mountain. This is the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area of ​​the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region. The workers opening the tunnel are digging the open entrance of the tunnel on the hillside. Comrade Xu Jia'yi looked at the purple small flowers all over the ground and the groups of bulldozers wriggling like small black dots in the distance at the foot of the mountain and said: "The spring of the motherland's construction is so beautiful! The climate here is similar to the climate in northeastern Korea, which is quite cold, but the cold cannot stop the arrival of spring. Look, flowers have grown on the snow! In Korea, it is also the time when azaleas are blooming all over the mountains. Our blood will not be shed in vain. One day, there will be a peaceful spring there, a spring of construction, like the good spring we see here." (Attached picture)

    在兰新铁路线上
    洪流
    “祖国建设得多快呀！看，在这样荒凉的地方，居然出现了这么多的推土机，这么多筑路的新机器，离开祖国两年多的我们，真是想都想不到呀！”
    徐家仪，一位刚从医院休养出来的志愿军二级战斗英雄兴奋地说，在他周围坐着换班下来的男女推土机手和家属们，前面，就是兰新铁路的哈溪河滩工地，一群一群的推土机，发着隆隆的巨响，把半丈来高的大块土方推走，扬起了几丈高的尘土，在原来崎岖不平的地方，出现了一条一条的平坦大道。
    “两年多来，我们在敌人眼皮底下挖地雷，在齐膝的冰河里架桥梁，谁也不叫苦，不说累，大家都认为这是给祖国的建设开路，给祖国的建设架桥。休息时，有人总喜欢用铅笔画一张祖国地图，又在图上画上一条条的红线，于是说：‘这条是我家门前的铁路。’我想起了王英同志，那个打仗十分勇敢，平时又十分快活的小伙子，要是他现在活着，看到了这种建筑铁路的情形，又该用拳头敲着膝盖大叫大嚷了。他是成都人，一次他接到了未婚妻的信，信上说：‘咱们四川人盼了四十年的成渝铁路动工修了，火车就要在咱门口经过，多好啊！’有一天晚上他梦见一列火车，呜嘟嘟地开到他家的门口，他嚷着要追上去，把身边睡的同志都惊醒了。”
    “可惜，没有多久，他牺牲了！”徐家仪的语调变得沉重起来，周围听的人也显得格外紧张。“那是在一九五一年的马良山战斗中，我们连的任务是在敌人火力集中的地方挖工事，上级规定每个班五小时挖两个阵地，而王英同志带的第八班，仅仅一百零三分钟就挖好了第一个阵地，这时，敌人发觉了，集中火力打他们，王英同志的臀部被弹片炸伤，鲜血直流，大家要他下去，他只摇了下头。接着他的左臂又被炸断了，担架队上来抬他，他仍然拒绝下去，他说：‘剩一只手也得坚持到底！’就在第二个阵地快挖好的时候，王英同志第三次负了重伤，光荣牺牲了。他临死时，还把身边仅有的三百元朝鲜币交给指导员，说要献给祖国作建设用呢！很快，上级党委批准追认王英同志为中国共产党党员，不久，他日夜梦想的火车也通到他的家门口了。现在，新的天成铁路正向西北伸出手来，他要和我们这里的兰新铁路握手了。”说到这里，徐家仪的语调渐渐兴奋起来，稍稍停了一下，他又惋惜地重复道：“要是王英同志还活着，他该多么高兴啊！”

    我们离开哈溪河滩工地，继续向鸟鞘岭前进。沿途的情景，处处使人鼓舞。我们看到满载架桥机和吊车的列车开向永登，我们看到满载玉门油矿石油的列车从龙泉寺车站开往兰州。黄河一出铁道便桥，便进入险峻的大山峡，水势更紧了，太阳照着水面，射出灿烂的金光，黄河两岸的麦浪，也像黄河一样在起伏，在放射着金光。在茂密的果树林旁，西北特有的黄河大水车正把河水车向两岸肥沃的土地上，黄河里滔滔的水声不断地被便桥上经过的列车的声音所掩盖。我们又看到十几只羊皮联成的筏子在黄河里行驶，筏子上像正有人在作水力勘测。我说：“中央燃料工业部已派人在黄河上游勘测；甘肃工业厅也准备在今年内派人在黄河上下游各测一百公里，他们都要为未来西北最大水力发电厂找一个最好的位置！”
    “今天的黄河多美啊！”徐家仪同志又兴奋起来，拍着我的肩膀说道：“黄河大水电站的理想一定会实现，将来那些黄土山中，也要开起一个个大的工厂，说不定这里还会出现多少城市，在从来的夜里都是漆黑一片的地方，变成像夜重庆那样万家灯火呢！”
    汽车沿着一座大石山的脚下前进，我们看到在那接近巍峨的山顶上，工人们用绳子绑着腰凌空开凿石方。这时，我打开刚从天成、兰新两铁路线上拍摄的照片给他看，我给他讲着一些使我感动的事。一个联合工程队的混凝土小队长，名叫宋杨树，去年七月十日，下起了倾盆大雨，他的老婆和孩子被洪水冲走了，邻居的工人都去救了，又派人到工地来喊他，他犹疑了一下，却仍是继续奋不顾身地去抢救隧道里的六千袋洋灰。结果他的孩子被淹死了，他的爱人被震坏了视神经。可是我去访问他时，他首先说：“好了，洋灰抢救出来了，前面的工程不会耽误。”还有，我最近到玉门油矿去过，为了兰新铁路修好以后，充分供应全国的石油需要，那里新井正在开凿，死井正在复活，在一次石油工人座谈会上，一个四川籍工人说：“我将来要坐上火车，不走一步就回到我的家门口，我们四川一年三熟的肥大米和三百元一斤的甜广柑，也要坐上火车跑到我们矿区来了，将来的日子多美丽啊！”
    “是的，将来的日子真是美丽呀！”徐家仪同志显然觉得这位工人的话正是他所要说的。
    一辆一辆载着工程人员、载着建筑材料的汽车正在向海拔三千公尺的高岭上开去。渐渐，我们的汽车也盘旋到山顶上了，呼吸慢慢感到有点窒息；天气也渐渐变得冷起来。在汽车两旁，开始出现了青青的嫩草，和放牧着的羊群，渐渐紫蓝色的小花朵遍布了山头。这里是天祝藏民自治区的半农半牧区，开隧道的工人正在山坡上挖隧道口的明洞。徐家仪同志看着满地紫色的小花朵，看着山下远处像小黑点一样蠕动着的推土机群说道：“祖国的建设的春天多美呀！这里的气候和朝鲜东北部的气候差不多，都是相当寒冷的，但是，寒冷阻挡不了春天的到来，你看，在雪地上不是也长出花朵来了！在朝鲜，现在也正是金达莱花开满山头的时候。我们的血不会白流，总有一天，那里会有一个和平的春天，建设的春天，像我们在这里看到的这样好的春天。”（附图片）
