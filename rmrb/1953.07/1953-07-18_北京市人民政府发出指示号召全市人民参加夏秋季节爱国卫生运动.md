The Beijing Municipal People's Government issued the following instructions for carrying out the summer and autumn patriotic health campaign:

The summer and autumn seasons are the periods when various infectious diseases are most likely to occur. In order to prevent various diseases, improve people's health, and ensure production, work, and study, it is of great significance to do a good job in summer and autumn health work. Especially in factories, mines, and construction sites, where the population is relatively concentrated, it is even more important to do a good job in hygiene. For this reason, it has been decided to launch a summer and autumn patriotic health campaign throughout the city from July 20 to August 10, calling on all citizens to respond enthusiastically.

The summer and autumn patriotic health campaign aims to further eliminate mosquito and fly breeding conditions by catching and killing mosquitoes and flies, and to achieve "no mosquitoes and flies indoors, no maggots in toilets," in order to prevent epidemic encephalitis B and intestinal infectious diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to:

First, everyone should develop the habit of swatting mosquitoes and flies, and should kill mosquitoes and flies when they are seen. Standing water and garbage that breed mosquitoes and flies should be removed at any time.

Second, pay attention to food hygiene and vigorously improve the sanitary conditions of the food industry. The main focus should be on the cold drink industry, restaurants, food stalls, and oil and salt shops. The Bureau of Public Health should strengthen the management of these industries, require that the food sold should have mosquito-proof and dust-proof equipment, tableware should be kept clean, cold foods should be strictly inspected, rotten food should be banned, and sauce jars and pickle jars should be free of maggots.

Third, pay special attention to strengthening hygiene in factories, mines, and construction sites. Under the principle of not affecting production and construction, the hygiene of production sites and living environment should be the primary focus. Establish a regular cleaning responsibility system for workshops, kitchens, canteens, toilets, dormitories, and work sheds, and maintain cleanliness at all times. Inspect after rain, fill in potholes, and remove standing water. Secondly, strictly manage food hygiene. In addition to strictly prohibiting the purchase of rotten and unclean food and providing sufficient safe drinking water (boiled water, tap water), construction site cooperatives, employee canteens, and small shops should be properly managed. In addition, a regular system of health education and inspection should be established to make workers universally aware of the importance of hygiene.

In order to smoothly carry out the summer and autumn patriotic health campaign, propaganda work must be done well. Fully mobilize various propaganda forces, use various propaganda and education methods, popularize health knowledge, and, in connection with the vital interests of the masses, specifically explain the purpose and significance of carrying out the patriotic health campaign. At the same time, the health organizations at all levels, especially the health organizations of factories, mines, and construction sites, should be rectified and improved. Generally, the main administrative cadres should be responsible for leadership, and there should be dedicated cadres to carry out the work. The health work of each unit should be arranged vertically by the respective administrative system, and at the same time be supervised and inspected by the health organizations in the district where they are located. During the campaign, good and bad examples should be promptly commended or criticized; hygiene inspections should pay attention to actual results, based on whether it is clean and whether there are mosquitoes and flies, rather than judging the merits based on the number of mosquitoes and flies swatted. In addition, special attention should be paid to the fact that the health campaign must be combined with production, study, and various tasks, so that health work is conducive to production and construction, and serves production construction, work, and study.

    北京市人民政府发出指示号召全市人民参加夏秋季节爱国卫生运动
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府为开展夏秋季节爱国卫生运动，特发出指示如下：
    夏秋季节，是各种传染病最容易发生的时期。为了预防各种疾病，增进人民健康，保证生产、工作、学习，作好夏秋季节的卫生工作是有重大意义的。尤其厂、矿、工地，人口比较集中，作好卫生工作更为重要。为此，决定从七月二十日起，到八月十日止，在全市范围内，开展一次夏秋季节爱国卫生运动，号召全体市民热烈响应。
    夏秋季节爱国卫生运动，是以捕灭蚊蝇进一步消灭蚊蝇孳生条件，做到“室内无蚊蝇，厕所没有蛆”，以防止流行性乙型脑炎和肠胃传染病为主要目标。所以必须：
    第一、每个人都应养成扑灭蚊蝇的习惯，要看见蚊蝇即打，孳生蚊蝇的积水、垃圾要随时清除。
    第二、注意饮食卫生，大力改进饮食行业的卫生条件。主要是清凉饮食业、饭铺、饭摊及油盐店。公共卫生局要加强对这些行业的管理，要求对所售食物要有防蝇、防尘设备，食具要保持清洁，冷食物品要严格检验，要禁售腐烂食品，酱缸、咸菜缸要做到没有蛆。
    第三、特别注意加强厂矿和工地卫生，在不影响生产、建设的原则下，首先应做好生产场所和生活环境的卫生工作，车间、厨房、食堂、厕所、宿舍及工棚建立经常的清扫责任制度，经常保持清洁。雨后并进行检查，填垫坑洼，清除积水。其次，应严格注意饮食卫生的管理，除严禁采购腐烂不洁的食品，供给足够的安全饮水（开水、自来水）外，应办好工地合作社、职工食堂、小卖部。此外，还应建立定期的卫生教育、检查制度，使职工普遍重视卫生。
    为顺利地开展夏秋季节的爱国卫生运动，必须做好宣传工作。充分动员各种宣传力量，利用各种宣传、教育方式，普及卫生知识，结合群众的切身利益，具体说明开展爱国卫生运动的目的和意义。同时，应整顿和健全各级卫生组织，特别是厂矿和工地的卫生组织，一般应以主要的行政干部负责领导，并有专责干部进行工作。各单位的卫生工作应由各该行政系统垂直布置，同时受所在区卫生组织的监督和检查。在运动中发现好坏典型及时予以表扬或批评；卫生检查要注意实际效果，以是否清洁，有无蚊蝇为标准，而不以扑打蚊蝇数字评优劣。此外，应特别注意，卫生运动必须结合生产、学习及各项工作来进行，使卫生工作有利于生产建设，为生产建设和工作、学习而服务。
