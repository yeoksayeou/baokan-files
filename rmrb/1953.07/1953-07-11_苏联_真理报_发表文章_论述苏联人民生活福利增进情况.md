Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: "Pravda" recently published an article by A. Koriagin, discussing the continuous improvement of the living standards and welfare of the Soviet people.

Koriagin pointed out that, unlike capitalism, the purpose of socialist production is not for profit, but to maximize the satisfaction of the society's growing material and cultural needs. From 1917 to 1952, the total industrial production of the United States only increased by 1.6 times, while the industrial production of the Soviet Union increased by 38 times in the same period. This created conditions for fully satisfying the growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet working people. For example, in 1952 alone, the various consumer goods obtained by the Soviet working people were more than the total amount of consumer goods obtained in the entire first Five-Year Plan. The increase in national income is the main indicator of the increase in the welfare of the Soviet people and the increase in social wealth. In 1952, the total national income of the Soviet Union was double the level of 1940 and eleven times the level of Tsarist Russia. The actual income of the working people has also increased greatly. In 1952, the average real income of workers and staff increased by about 68 percent compared with 1940, and the average real income of farmers increased by about 73 percent. The Soviet Union has consistently reduced the retail prices of industrial products and food, which is an important method of systematically improving the living standards and welfare of the working people. In 1952, the prices of various industrial products and food in the Soviet Union were on average half lower than at the end of 1947. This year, the Soviet Union implemented its sixth post-war price reduction, and the prices of various daily necessities are even lower. In contrast, prices in capitalist countries have risen year after year since the war. For example, in recent years alone, consumer prices in France have risen by 22 percent, Sweden by 16 percent, Norway by 14 percent, and West Germany by 9 percent.

Koriagin went on to say that the Soviet Communist Party and the government are very concerned about the welfare of the working people and allocate large sums of money every year to pay for various allowances and subsidies under the workers, staff and social insurance funds, to pay for pensions, to provide the working people or their children with free or low-cost access to sanatoriums, rest homes, kindergartens, to pay allowances to single mothers and mothers with many children, and scholarships to students. In 1952, the total value of remuneration and benefits enjoyed by the urban and rural working people from state subsidies was about 129 billion rubles. The Soviet Union has established the most advanced and perfect people's health system, so that everyone can enjoy skilled medical care free of charge. In 1952, the state allocated 27.7 billion rubles from the social insurance fund for the free medical care of the working people. In addition, the Soviet state also pays great attention to and continuously improves the living conditions of the working people. In the past seven years, 155 million square meters of housing have been built in cities and workers' residential areas. During the same period, the scale of residential construction in the United States has shrunk. According to foreign newspapers, more than 10 million families in the United States live in shacks, and millions more are homeless.

Koriagin said that while improving material welfare, the cultural level of the Soviet people is also constantly improving. The Soviet people have extensive opportunities for education, research knowledge, and culture. According to statistics, the number of students receiving various educations in the Soviet Union has increased from 8 million in 1914 to 57 million in 1952. Among them, the number of college students studying in universities has increased from 117,000 in 1914 to 1,442,000 in 1952. In addition, from 1914 to 1950, the Soviet Union also trained about 6 million skilled workers from the labor reserve system.

Koriagin concluded by saying that the living standards and welfare of the Soviet people will be greatly improved during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people are rapidly developing socialist production and striving to further satisfy the growing material and cultural needs of the working people.

    苏联“真理报”发表文章
    论述苏联人民生活福利增进情况
    【新华社九日讯】莫斯科消息：“真理报”最近发表了阿·科里亚金的一篇文章，论述苏联人民生活福利不断增进的情况。
    科里亚金指出：和资本主义不同，社会主义生产的目的不是为了利润，而是为了最大限度地满足社会日益增长的物质和文化的需要。从一九一七年到一九五二年，美国的工业生产总共只增加了一点六倍，而苏联的工业生产在同一时期就增加了三十八倍。这便为充分满足苏联劳动人民日益增长的物质和文化需要创造了条件。例如，仅在一九五二年一年中，苏联劳动人民所获得的各种消费品，比第一个五年计划的五年中所获得消费品的总量还要多。国民收入的增加，是苏联人民福利增进、社会财富增加的主要标志。一九五二年，苏联国民收入的总额比一九四○年的水平提高了一倍，比沙俄时代的水平提高了十一倍。劳动人民的实际收入，也随着大大增加了。一九五二年，工人和职员的实际收入平均每人较一九四○年约增加了百分之六十八，农民的实际收入平均每人约增加了百分之七十三。苏联一贯降低工业品和食品的零售价格，这是有系统地增进劳动人民的生活福利的重要方法。一九五二年苏联各种工业品和食品的价格，比一九四七年年底平均降低了一半。今年苏联又实行了战后第六次减价，各种生活日用品的价格更低了。和这相反，战后资本主义国家的物价年年上涨。例如，仅在最近几年中，法国的消费品价格上涨了百分之二十二，瑞典上涨了百分之十六，挪威上涨了百分之十四，西德上涨了百分之九。
    科里亚金接着说，苏联共产党和政府非常关怀劳动人民的福利，每年拨出大笔款项来支付工人、职员和社会保险基金项下的各种津贴和补助费，支付养老金，供给劳动人民或其子女免费或低费进疗养院、休养所、幼儿园，付给单身母亲和子女众多的母亲的津贴及学生的助学金。一九五二年，城乡的劳动人民从国家的补助费中享受到的报酬和利益总值约有一千二百九十亿卢布。苏联建立了最先进的、最完善的人民保健制度，使每个人都可以免费享受技术熟练的医疗。一九五二年，国家就从社会保险基金中拨出二百七十七亿卢布作为劳动人民免费医疗的费用。此外，苏维埃国家也非常注意并不断改善劳动人民的居住条件。最近七年来，在城市和工人住宅区已建造了一亿五千五百万平方公尺居住面积的房屋。而同时期内，美国住宅建筑的规模却缩减了。据外国报纸报道，美国有一千余万家庭住在草棚里，另外还有千百万人无家可归。
    科里亚金说，和改善物质福利同时，苏联人民的文化水平也在不断提高。苏联人民有着广泛的受教育、研究知识和文化的机会。据统计，现在苏联受各种教育的学生，从一九一四年的八百万人增加到一九五二年的五千七百万人。其中在高等学校学习的大学生，已从一九一四年的十一万七千人增加到一九五二年的一百四十四万二千人。此外，从一九一四年到一九五零年，苏联还从劳动后备系统中培养了六百万左右的熟练工人。
    科里亚金最后说：在第五个五年计划期间，苏联人民的生活福利将大大提高。苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，正迅速发展社会主义生产，为进一步满足劳动人民不断增长的物质和文化需要而奋斗。
