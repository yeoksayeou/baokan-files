Jilin Province Huaide Agricultural Technology Guidance Station

Achieves Success in Spring Agricultural Technology Promotion Work

The Huaide Agricultural Technology Guidance Station, directly under the Jilin Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture, achieved significant results in promoting new-style farm tools and agricultural technologies this spring. This year, the station mobilized farmers in four guidance areas in the local Jianshanzi, Wang Xuefang, and other three villages to use new-style animal-drawn farm tools. Adopting the advanced experience of Zhaoyuan, they converted ridged planting to flat planting, and broadly sowed densely planted millet, soybeans, and other crops on 680.92 hectares. During the drought resistance process, they also achieved continuous operations such as harrowing and pressing, completing the sowing task eleven days earlier than last year. They also made considerable achievements in other agricultural technology guidance aspects. Regarding seeds, within the station's guidance scope, soybean seeds were generally selected once, and soybean seeds for seed plots were selected by grain and hilum. Sorghum and millet seeds were winnowed twice, and corn seeds were all topped and tailed. Seed germination rates generally reached over 95%. Seed plots were established on 35 hectares, with production mutual aid teams as units. The purity of seeds was required to reach over 95%. Special personnel were assigned to be responsible for seed plots to strengthen technical guidance. In addition, male-sterile hybrid corn and artificial assisted pollination were promoted in key groups (cooperatives) in some areas. In terms of disease and pest control, the entire station dispatched ten hand-cranked seed treaters, touring various villages to help the masses carry out large-scale disinfection and seed treatment work. All wheat seeds within the station's guidance scope were treated with 2/1000 Ceresan, and all sorghum and millet seeds were treated with 3/1000 Ceresan. Special emphasis was placed on washing millet five times with clean water. It was required to reduce the incidence of sorghum smut to 5% this year (the average incidence rate in the local area last year was about 13%). The incidence of millet smut and white leaf disease was required to be reduced from the average incidence rate of 10% last year to 4%. For the control of aphids, cutworms, beetle larvae, sorghum weevil, etc., experiments were conducted to use "lead arsenate," "1605," "arsenic," and wettable "666" powder for poisoning and control in key areas. In terms of manure fertilizer, there was also a significant increase compared to the past. With the specific help and guidance of the guidance station cadres, the masses also put forward the catchy slogan "Sweep the floor well, the manure pile will grow, apply more manure and harvest more grain," and launched a manure accumulation and composting campaign, opening up manure sources. In addition to applying soil manure, the masses also applied dried night soil, kang ash, etc., and the quality was also improved compared to last year. For example, in Jianshanzi Village, the village's cultivated land is 1350 hectares, and only 50% of the land was fertilized last year, but this year it increased to 73.7%. After the Spring Festival this year, the Wang Wenrong Agricultural Production Cooperative dispatched six carts every day and purchased more than 2700 carts of manure from Fanjiatun, Changchun, and other towns in less than a month, so that 100% of the cooperative's cultivated land was applied with base fertilizer. All soybeans within the station's guidance scope were inoculated with rhizobium. In addition, the entire station also mobilized farmers to focus on using 33,000 jin of granular fertilizer and 300 jin of superphosphate. Due to the implementation of these technical measures, various autumn crops in the fields this year are growing very densely, laying a good foundation for this year's increased production.

The station gained the following valuable experience in this year's spring promotion work:

First, the station focused on promoting new-style farm tool technology, combined with the promotion of various agricultural scientific technologies, and clarified that the purpose of promoting technology was to increase production. According to the requirements of promoting Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience, they deeply studied with the farmers and modified six ten-row (disc-type) and three twelve-row (shoe-type) seeders so that they could broadly sow various crops and combine sowing with fertilization. They also modified 82 sets of old farm tools such as harrows and planters for 44 groups (cooperatives) to make these farm tools suitable for broad sowing. In this situation, the promotion of seed selection, fertilization, and other agricultural technologies prevented the tendency of separating the promotion of farm tools and agricultural technologies. For example, Wang Wenrong and other three agricultural production cooperatives used this modified seeder to sow more than 100 hectares of various crops such as sorghum and millet, and broadcasted more than 20,000 jin of granular fertilizer and 6,000 jin of dried night soil mixed with seeds. Secondly, in the process of promoting the work, measures were taken to make the technology take root among the masses. Before the spring plowing, the station specially held a six-day short-term technical training class, selecting more than 90 activists, Youth League members, and young women from the mutual aid groups to participate in the study. They were taught how to learn the most practical main technologies in spring plowing, such as the operation of new-style farm tools such as plows, harrows, seeders, and rollers, and seed treatment methods. After mastering the technology, these activists can immediately play a role when they return to the village, and naturally form the core force for promoting technology in various groups (cooperatives), so that the technical promotion work can be truly carried out in a leadership and organized manner.

When carrying out the promotion of each technology, the station also convened production team leaders, labor models, party and league members, production activists, etc. to conduct typical demonstrations, set a good example, and organize farmers in surrounding villages to visit, using facts to break the conservative thinking of the farmers.

For example, when the "equal-distance broad sowing" high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan County was first promoted in Jianshanzi Village, some farmers reflected: "It takes two liang of sugar to blow a sugar figurine, and broad planting is not possible in our village." In response to this situation, the guidance station combined with the example of the Wu Zhongren mutual aid group in the village that year, which produced more grain due to the implementation of broad sowing of millet, to promote it to them, and organized the surrounding masses to visit the field in the group. After checking the stubble, counting the rows, and calculating the accounts, the farmers saw the actual facts and discussed one after another: "It is true that hearing is not as good as seeing. This time I saw the real people and real things, and my mind is enlightened."

In addition, in the process of promotion work, the guidance station also signed technical combination contracts with six agricultural production cooperatives. Through it, the specific tasks of the station's promotion work and the farmers' production increase plans were unified as the common struggle goal of both parties in the production throughout the year, which is also a strong guarantee for the implementation of various technical measures. Their over-fulfillment of the tasks stipulated in the contract in spring plowing and spring sowing also proves this point. For example, the Zhang Zhankui Agricultural Production Cooperative signed a contract with the guidance station, which originally stipulated that 20 hectares of land should be cultivated with new-style animal-drawn farm tools, but actually completed 26 hectares.

    吉林省怀德农业技术指导站
    在春季推广农业技术工作中作出成绩
    吉林省人民政府农业厅直属怀德农业技术指导站，今年春季推广新式农具和农业技术，获得显著成绩。全站今年在当地尖山子、王学坊等三个村的四个指导区，发动农民使用新式马拉农具，采用肇源先进经验，改垄作为平作，共宽播密植谷子、大豆等作物达六百八十点九二垧。在抗旱过程中并做到耙地压地等连续作业，比去年提前十一天完成了播种任务，在其他各项农业技术指导方面，也作出了不少成绩。在种籽方面，在站的指导范围内，一般地大豆种籽都普遍的做到了粒选一遍，留种地大豆种籽并做到粒选和脐选，高粱、谷子做到风筛选二遍，玉米种籽全部做到搯头去尾。结合选种并做好了发芽试验，种籽发芽率普遍达到百分之九十五以上。并以生产互助组为单位，建立了留种地三十五垧。要求种籽纯度达到百分之九十五以上。对留种地设有专人负责，以便加强技术指导。另外在重点组（社）部分地推行了玉米种内去雄杂交和人工辅助授粉。在防治病虫害方面，全站出动十台手摇拌种器，巡回各村，帮助群众展开了大规模的消毒拌种工作，在全站指导范围内的全部小麦种使用了千分之二的赛力散拌种，高粱、谷子全部使用千分之三的赛力散拌种，并重点采取谷子用清水洗五遍的办法，高粱黑穗病要求把今年发病率压缩到百分之五（去年当地的平均发病率在百分之十三左右），谷子黑穗病与白发病要求从去年当地平均发病率的百分之十压低到百分之四。对蚜虫，夜盗虫，金龟子幼虫，高粱长桩象等的防治工作，试验在有重点地使用“砒酸铅”、“一六○五”、“信石”及可湿性“六六六”粉进行毒杀与防治的方法。在粪肥方面，较过去也有显著增加。在指导站干部的具体帮助与指导下，群众还提出了“扫帚响，粪堆涨，多施粪肥多打粮”的响亮口号，展开了积肥造肥运动。开辟了粪源。群众除了施用土粪外，还施用了大粪干、炕洞灰等，质量也比去年提高。如尖山子村全村耕地一千三百五十垧，去年施肥的只有百分之五十，今年就增加达百分之七十三点七。王文荣农业生产合作社，在今年春节以后，全社每天就出动六辆大车，在不到一个月的时期内，从范家屯长春等城镇购回了二千七百多车粪，使全社耕地百分之百的都施了基肥。在全站指导范围内的大豆全部使用根瘤菌接种。此外全站还发动农民重点的使用颗粒肥料三万三千斤，过燐酸石灰三百斤。由于这些技术措施的贯彻，今年田里各种秋季作物，都长得很是密茂，为今年的增产打下了良好的基础。
    该站在今年春季的推广工作中，获得了以下的宝贵经验：
    首先，该站是以推广新式农具技术为主，结合推广各项农业科学技术，并明确推广技术是为了增产的目的性。他们根据推广肇源丰产经验的要求，深入地和农民一道研究，改装了六台十行（圆盘式）与三台十二行（靴式）播种机，使它能够宽播各种作物，和结合播种进行施肥，并为四十四个组（社）改装了耲耙、点葫芦等旧农具八十二套，使这些农具适用于宽播。在这一情况下，又推广选种、施肥等各项农业技术，就防止了推广农具和农业技术分家的倾向。如王文荣等三个农业生产合作社，使用这种改装的播种机就播种了高粱、谷子等各种作物达百余垧，与种籽混合的播施颗粒肥料达二万余斤，大粪干六千余斤。其次，在推广工作进行的过程中，采取了使技术在群众中扎根的做法。在春耕前，该站特地开办了历时六天的短期技术训练班，挑选互助组中的积极分子，青年团员，青年妇女等九十余人，参加学习。教他们学会在春耕中最实用的几种主要技术，如犁、耙、播种机、镇压器等新式农具的操纵，和种籽处理方法等。这些积极分子掌握了技术后，回村马上就能起作用，在各个组（社）中，很自然的就形成为推广技术的核心力量，使各项技术推广工作，能够真正做到有领导有组织的进行。
    在进行推广每项技术时，该站还召集生产组长，劳动模范，党、团员，生产积极分子等进行典型示范，做好样子，并组织周围村屯农民参观，用事实来打破农民们的保守思想。
    如最初在尖山子村推广肇源县“等距宽播”丰产经验时，有的农民反映：“吹糖人还得二两糖稀呢，宽种在咱村算办不到。”指导站针对这一情况便结合该村吴仲仁互助组上年因实行宽播谷子多打粮食的实例向他们进行宣传，组织周围群众前往该组进行田间参观，经过查槎子，数弓口、算细账，农民们看到实际事实后纷纷议论说：“真是耳听不如眼见，这次看到真人实事，脑子算开窍啦。”
    此外，在推广工作过程中，指导站还先后与六个农业生产合作社订立了技术结合合同。通过它把站的推广工作的具体任务，与农民的增产计划统一起来，作为双方在全年生产中的共同奋斗目标，这也是各项技术措施贯彻的有力保证。他们在春耕春播中超额完成合同所规定的任务，也证明了这一点。如张占奎农业生产合作社与指导站订的合同，原规定用新式马拉农具耕种二十垧地，实际上完成了二十六垧。（李明发）
