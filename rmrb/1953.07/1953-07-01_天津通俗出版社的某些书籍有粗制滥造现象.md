Reader's Letters Summary

    Some Books from Tianjin Popular Publishing House are Shoddily Made
    Zhou Aiwen from the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau writes: Sixteen books edited by the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and published by the Tianjin Popular Publishing House have very serious shoddy workmanship. Among these sixteen books, ten are called "Youth Reading Materials"; three are called "Study Reference Materials on Communism and the Communist Party"; and the other three are called "People of Honor," "Our Great Motherland is Moving Towards the Road of Peaceful Construction," and "Dedicate Your Life to the Cause of the Party." From January 1952 to February 1953, a total of 994,000 copies of these sixteen books were published.
    Almost all of the aforementioned sixteen books are pieced together by cutting and pasting articles from various newspapers, magazines, and books with scissors and glue; even so, there are still many problems in the editing work. For example, the content and even chapters of the two books, "Introduction to the Soviet Socialist State" in the first volume of the second series of "Study Reference Materials on Communism and the Communist Party" and "From Socialism to Communism" in the second volume of the second series, are roughly the same. At the same time, when excerpting Comrade Liu Shaoqi's important document "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," the emphasis marks used by Comrade Liu Shaoqi when quoting Lenin's words were deleted in more than one place. In addition, all the articles in the book "Youth Unite and March Towards Lasting Peace!" are reprinted from various newspapers and periodicals, and except for the last article which has a time mark, the original publication date of the other articles is not indicated. When the articles say "this year" and "today," readers simply do not know what year and day they refer to.
    The main tasks of local publishing houses are: to combine with local realities, use local themes as content, and meet the special needs of local readers. The editing and publishing of the aforementioned sixteen books by the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Youth League and the Tianjin Popular Publishing House are not in line with their work guidelines. Doing so not only makes the quality of publications poor due to their insufficient strength, but also causes waste due to the duplication of book content with publications from central-level publishing houses.
    Editor's note: The opinions of reader Zhou Aiwen, after being studied by the Publishing Administration of the Central People's Government Publishing Department, are considered to be correct. It is understood that these sixteen books are still being reprinted recently. It is suggested that the Tianjin Popular Publishing House study and improve its future work based on the work guidelines of local publishing houses and in combination with the opinions of readers.

### 天津通俗出版社的某些书籍有粗制滥造现象

专栏：读者来信摘要

    天津通俗出版社的某些书籍有粗制滥造现象
    天津市人民政府文化事业管理局周艾文来信：中国新民主主义青年团天津市委员会宣传部编辑的、天津通俗出版社出版的十六种书籍，粗制滥造现象非常严重。这十六种书，其中有十种叫“青年读物”；有三种叫“共产主义与共产党学习参考材料”；其它三种叫“荣誉的人”、“我们伟大的祖国向着和平建设的大道前进”和“终身献给党的事业”。这十六种书，从一九五二年一月起到一九五三年二月为止，先后共出版了九十九万四千册。
    上述十六种书几乎全部是用剪刀、浆糊剪贴各种报纸、杂志、图书中的文章而凑成的；就是这样，编辑工作中的问题仍是不少。如“共产主义与共产党学习参考材料”第二辑第一分册“苏联社会主义国家介绍”和第二辑第二分册“由社会主义到共产主义”两书内容甚至章节大致相同。同时，书中节录刘少奇同志“论共产党员的修养”这一重要文件时，刘少奇同志所引列宁的话的旁重点，不止一处地被删去了。此外，“青年团结起来，向持久和平前进！”一书的文章全是从各种报刊上转载来的，其中除最末一篇文章有时间标志外，其它各篇都没载明原作发表日期。文章中所说的“今年”、“今天”，读者看了根本不知是何年何日。
    地方出版社的任务，主要是：结合地方实际，以地方题材为内容，来满足地方读者的特殊需要。青年团天津市委宣传部和天津通俗出版社编辑和出版上述十六种书，是和他们的工作方针不符合的。这样做，不但因为他们力量不足而使出版物质量粗劣，而且也因书籍内容与中央一级出版社的出版物重复而造成浪费。
    编者按：读者周艾文的意见，经过中央人民政府出版总署出版管理局研究，认为是正确的。据了解，这十六种书最近还在重版。建议天津通俗出版社根据地方出版社的工作方针，结合读者的意见，来研究改进今后的工作。
